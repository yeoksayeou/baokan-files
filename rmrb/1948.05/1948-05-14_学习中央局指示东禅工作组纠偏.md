    Learning the Central Bureau's Instructions on Correcting Deviations by the Dongchan Work Team
    [Pingshun News] The Dongchan Work Team, studying the Central Bureau's instructions on correcting deviations and based on the spirit of the document, examined deviations in the land reform. The whole village has a total of 474 households. Before 1947, 84 households were struggled against, accounting for 18% of the total number of households in the village and 24% of the population. After this democratic re-evaluation movement, and studying the central government's class division regulations, a second class division was conducted. Of the original 84 households struggled against, only 15 were landlords and 19 were rich peasants, totaling 217 people, accounting for 7% of the total number of households and a little over 11% of the total population. 50 households were reclassified as middle and poor peasants (including 32 well-to-do middle peasants, 16 middle peasants, and 2 poor peasants). Reasons for wrongful struggle: 28 households were struggled against because they were in larger earthwork teams, 10 households were struggled against because they were engaged in business outside the village, had no labor at home, or rented out land (land ownership equivalent to middle peasants), 7 households had minor political errors, and 5 households had slight exploitation. After a mass meeting, the results of the class division were announced. Then, the leader of the work team (secretary of the district committee) apologized to the wrongly struggled middle peasants on behalf of the Party, admitting the mistake. Following this, a committee was selected to specifically discuss compensation and resettlement issues. First, the village's stored fruit land and land cultivated by the troops, fruit grain and public granary grain, fruit farming tools, fertilizers, etc., were all tallied. Then, each household was discussed individually. A total of 59 households, including poor and hired peasants who had not yet been liberated, landlords driven from their homes, and wrongly struggled middle peasants who had nothing to eat, were all discussed and solutions were worked out separately. 29 poor peasant households in difficulty were lent 17.9 *shi* of grain, and 4 households were lent 7.6 *mu* of land. 11 landlords driven from their homes were lent 1.1 *shi* of grain. 6 households of old, weak, and disabled middle peasants were lent 2.9 *shi* of grain, and 1 household was lent 1.8 *mu* of land. 10 wrongly struggled middle peasant households lacking land were compensated with 17.8 *mu* of land; 18 households lacking grain were lent 7.3 *shi* of grain. The remaining more than 1,200 *dan* of manure and 14 pieces of farming tools were all compensated to the wrongly struggled middle peasants. The cooperative returned all of the wrongly struggled middle peasants' shares of over 110,000 yuan, and they were free to withdraw or retain their shares. Niu Si, the village finance and grain director, who had been removed from his post as a rich peasant after being struggled against, was now reclassified as a well-to-do middle peasant and was reinstated to his original position through the Poor Peasants Association (should be through the entire masses—Editor). The rule that landlords and rich peasants had to repay their debts to poor and hired peasants with ten days of free labor per month was abolished. Landlords' and rich peasants' daughters were free to marry peasants. Niu Yanggou, a rich peasant, had a nineteen-year-old daughter who had been engaged to a worker in a Wuxiang factory for a long time, but her repeated requests to get married had been denied. As soon as this announcement was made, the man was immediately notified to return home from the Wuxiang factory to get married. The 50 wrongly struggled peasants formally returned to the ranks of the peasantry and were very happy. Cheng Masuo's wife said to a neighbor, "If I hadn't been reclassified as a middle peasant, I wouldn't have dared to sit in your house. That landlord hat on my head almost killed me." Niu Yanggou used to have no heart to work, but now that he has been reclassified as a middle peasant, the whole family got up early and went to the fields the next day. Except for two households with no labor, all 50 households participated in mutual aid. The Poor Peasants Association is currently reviewing and introducing them separately, preparing to formally absorb them into the Peasant Association. Now the general middle peasant sentiment has stabilized and they are actively producing.

    学习中央局指示东禅工作组纠偏
    【平顺消息】东禅工作组学习中央局纠偏指示根据文件精神，检查土改中偏向。全村共四七四户，四七年以前共斗了八十四户，占全村户数百分之十八，人口百分之二十四，经过这次民主抽补运动，学习了中央划阶级规定，进行第二次划阶级。原斗八十四户中，只有地主十五户，富农十九户，共二一七口人，占全村总户数百分之七，总人口百分之十一多。改订为中贫农的五十户（内富裕中农三十二户，中农十六户，贫农二户）。斗错原因：以圪堆大斗了二十八户，外出经商、家无劳力、出租土地的十户（土地占有等于中农），政治上有点错误的七户，有轻微剥削的五户。经过群众大会，宣布了划阶级结果后，即由工作组组长（区委书记）代表党向斗错中农作了检讨，承认错误。接着选了一个委员会，专门讨论补偿安置问题。首先把村存的果实地和部队种的地，果实粮和义仓粮，果实农具、肥料等统计一下；又逐户讨论，未翻身的贫雇，扫地出门地主，错斗中农，当下无吃的，共五十九户，都分别讨论出调解办法。贫农困难户二十九户，借粮十七石九，有四户借地七亩六。扫地出门地主十一口，借粮石一。六户老弱残废中农，借粮二石九，有一户借地一亩八。错斗中农缺地的十户，补地十七亩八；缺粮的十八户，借粮七石三。其余有一千二百多担粪，十四件农具，都补给错斗中农。合作社把错斗中农股金十一万余元全部退还，抽股留股自便。村财粮主任牛四则以富农被斗撤职，这次订正成份为富裕中农，通过贫农团恢复了原职（应通过全体群众——编者）。地主富农过去每月以十天无偿劳动还贫雇债的规定，宣布取消。地主富农女儿与农民能自由结婚。富农牛羊狗一个闺女，十九岁了，早与武乡工厂一个工人订了婚，但屡次要求，不能结婚。这一宣布，马上到武乡工厂通知男方返家结婚。五十户错斗农民正式返归农民队伍，都很高兴。程马锁老婆到邻家说：“不是划成我中农，我可不敢到你家坐坐。过去头上顶的这个地主帽，把我差点压死。”牛羊狗过去没心劳动，现在划成中农，第二天全家起早都上了地。除两户无劳力外，五十户都参加了互助。贫农团正在分头审查介绍，准备正式吸收参加农会。现在一般中农情绪都稳定下来，积极生产了。
