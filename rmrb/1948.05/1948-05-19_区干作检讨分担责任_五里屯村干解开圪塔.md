　　District Cadres Conduct Self-Criticism and Share Responsibility
    Village Cadres of Wulitun Untie Knots in Their Hearts
    [Jilu Yu News] Shi Jinjian, the instructor of Wulitun Village in the Second District of Nanfeng, participated in the joint meeting of village branch cadres in the sub-district, and the knot in his heart was untied. After returning to the village, he enthusiastically led the masses in production. He said to others: "In the early years, people were sent from above to investigate and find faults with the village cadres everywhere, without even having a good talk. At that time, I really didn't want to do anything; after the New Year, the comrades from the district came back from the meeting in the east. Every time there was a meeting, it was my fault, and that was also my fault. It wasn't all pushed on me. I felt there was no way out. All day long, I felt like I had a brick stuck in my heart. This time, I finally understood. The district cadres also made self-criticisms, sharing the responsibility with us. Whoever made the mistake, it was their own, and everyone was asked to correct their mistakes and learn well. This is like having a road to take, and my energy has also been ignited." There was a poor peasant named Shi Yutu, who still had three mu of land unplowed. He went to mobilize him, but Shi Yutu said, "Those three mu of land haven't been fertilized for two or three years. Even if they are planted, the harvest won't be good enough to pay the public grain. It's a waste of effort." Jinjian said to him, "Planting is always better than not planting. How much public grain do you need?" Yutu said, "I have neither livestock nor seeds." Jinjian said, "That doesn't matter. I will lend you my livestock, and I will also help you find a way to get seeds." Yutu's enthusiasm for production was ignited. He managed to get some seeds, and Jinjian asked his father to take his own cattle to plow the land for Yutu. In two days, the plowing, harrowing, and sowing were completed. In the past few days, through Jinjian and the chairman of the Farmers' Association personally pulling the harrow and patiently mobilizing, the masses of Wulitun have been energized, and in four or five days, all the more than 80 mu of spring and wasteland in the village have been cultivated.

　　区干作检讨分担责任
    五里屯村干解开圪塔
    【冀鲁豫消息】南峰二区五里屯村指导员史金鉴，在小区参加各村支干联席会，心里的圪塔解开啦，回村后热心的领导群众生产。他对别人说：“打头年哩上边派人来摸底，到处找村干的毛病，也不给好好的谈，那会我真是啥也不想干啦；过了年区里同志从东边开会回来，一开会这也是俺的错，那也是俺的错，不是都推到俺身上了，我觉着没路可走啦，整天心里象塞着块砖，这回我才摸底啦。区里干部也作了检讨，给咱分担责任，谁的错是谁的，叫大家改错学好。这算有了路，我的劲也起来啦。”有一家贫农史玉图，还有三亩地没犁，他去动员他，史玉图说：“那三亩地二三年没上粪啦，种上也收不好，不够交公粮，白费力气。”金鉴对他说：“种上总比不种强，公粮该用几斤啊。”玉图说：“又没牲口又没种。”金鉴说：“这不要紧，我的牲口借给你，没粮食种我也帮助你生法。”玉图生产的劲起来了，弄了些粮食种，金鉴让他爹带着自己的牛去给玉图犁地，两天的工夫，连犁带耙带耩就完啦。这几天经过金鉴和农会长的亲自动手拉耙，和耐心的动员，五里屯的群众带起劲来，四五天的工夫全村八十多亩春地荒地都弄完了。
