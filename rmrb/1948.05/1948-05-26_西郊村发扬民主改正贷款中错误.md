(Taihang News) Xijiao Village in Pingding County has used democratic methods to correct the tendencies of cadres and cooperatives monopolizing loans and left-leaning deviations in new and old loans. The village has issued a total of 3.95 million yuan in loans. In the loan distribution, ordinary people received a maximum of 3,300 yuan per household and a minimum of 400 yuan. Cadres and those related to cadres received almost 20,000 to 40,000 yuan per household. Particularly serious was that large and small cooperatives in the village occupied 2.39 million yuan in loans, accounting for 60 percent of all loans. In addition, the left-leaning tendency of bestowing favors on poor peasants and encroaching on loans to middle peasants was very serious. During the loan review and transfer last winter, 113 households were forced to transfer their loans, including 92 middle peasants, 14 "impoverished households," and 5 poor peasants. The above problems have recently been discussed democratically by the masses, and three measures have been decided: First, the cooperatives occupying the loans must return them to the original borrowers within a time limit. 1.34 million yuan has already been returned, and the rest must be returned before mid-April to mid-May. Second, it is affirmed that middle peasants have the same right to loans. New loans are not divided between middle and poor peasants, but are discussed by everyone to determine who has production difficulties that cannot be solved, and who can borrow. Middle peasants who were transferred loans last year will be taken care of in the new loans. Third, everyone recognizes that loans are for production, not simply for relief to widows, widowers, and orphans. Old loans, except for those genuinely engaged in labor-capital combination and mutual aid production, should be persuaded to be recovered for shareholding and lending, and transferred to others. Those who have no labor and cannot live should be provided with relief. The spring loan of 1.4 million yuan and 30 stone of grain has been implemented in accordance with the new spirit.

(Taihang News) The Second Administrative Office of the Second Special District and the Second Branch of the Jinan Bank, in order to correct the phenomenon of excluding middle peasants that still exists in this year's spring plowing loans, recently issued instructions to all counties to conduct a rapid inspection. In particular, difficult middle peasants who have been wrongly criticized and transferred their loans should be resolved by the county and district through unified adjustment, with the district or joint defense as the unit. The instructions of the Second Branch particularly pointed out that the transfer of loans since last year has seriously infringed on the loan rights of middle peasants. In some places, in order to transfer loans, middle peasants were forced to sell grain and livestock, creating antagonism between middle and poor peasants. This is a very serious error in principle. In the future, it is affirmed that poor peasants, middle peasants, and handicraft workers in rural areas are all objects of our loan assistance. According to the above principles, we should adopt the "three comparisons" method of comparing difficulties, comparing uses, and comparing foundations, and adopt self-reporting, public discussion, and democratic decision-making to determine whether a loan is possible, the order of priority, the urgency, and the amount. Some places have detached loans from organizing mass production and regard it as simple relief. The loans in Qi County last year did not organize mass labor production, and most of them were lent to mutual aid societies to engage in trading, which resulted in losses. This is also an error in principle and must be strictly inspected and corrected.

　　西郊村发扬民主改正贷款中错误
    【太行消息】平定西郊村运用民主方式，纠正新旧贷款中干部与合作社独占及左倾等偏向。该村前后共贷款三百九十五万元。贷款中，一般群众每户最多三千三百元，最少四百元。干部及与干部有关的人，差不多每户都是两三万或三四万。特别严重的是全村大小合作社占用贷款达二百三十九万元，占了全部贷款百分之六十。另外是恩赐贫雇，侵犯中农贷款的左倾偏向很严重。去冬查转贷时，有一百一十三户被逼转款，内有中农九十二户，“破落户”十四户，还有贫农五户。上述问题最近经群众民主讨论，决议了三项办法：一、大小合作社占用贷款限期退给原贷户。现已退出一百三十四万元，其余要在四月到五月半前退完。二、肯定中农有同样贷款权利。新贷款不分中贫农，由大家讨论，谁生产困难没法解决，谁就可以贷。对去年被转贷的中农，要在新贷款中予以照顾。三、大家认识了贷款为生产，不是单纯救济鳏寡孤独。旧贷款除真正劳资结合互助生产外，其它入股放帐的应说服收回，转贷别人，无劳力没法生活的，从救济上设法解决。这次春贷一百四十万元，粮三十石，已按新精神执行。
    【太行消息】二专署与冀南银行二分行，为纠正今年春耕贷款中仍然存在着的排斥中农现象，最近特向各县发出指示，迅速检查。特别对斗错的和被转贷的困难中农，应以区或联防为单位，由县区统一调剂解决。二分行的指示特别指出：去年以来的转贷，严重侵犯了中农的贷款权利，甚至有的地方为了转款，逼使中农卖粮、卖牲口，造成中农与贫农对立，这是极大的原则错误。今后肯定农村里的贫雇、中农、手工业工人，都是我们贷款扶助的对象。并应根据上述原则，以比困难、比用途、比根底的三比办法，采取自报公议，民主决定，确定是否可贷，贷的先后、缓急、数目多少。有些地方贷款和组织群众生产脱节，看做单纯救济。去年祁县贷款，即没有组织群众劳力生产，大部都贷给了互助社去搞买卖，结果都赔了钱。这也是原则错误，必须严格检查纠正。
