[Ji Lu Yu News] The Gao Ling County Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres from various sub-districts on April 20th to discuss ideology, work style, and to correct deviations. After the discussions, it was found that the general thinking of the cadres was that they were not bold enough in their work, feared making mistakes, that the old ways could not be used, and that there were no new ways. Some felt that it was difficult to be a worker, and some even requested to be transferred to be cooks. Cadres who had been through Party rectification were afraid that people would say that their poor peasant and hired laborer viewpoint was not strong enough and their stance was not firm enough. They did not approach or educate the old village cadres, considering them a bunch. They also did not approach the middle peasants, and after going down to the villages, they only contacted the poor peasants and hired laborers, never seeing the village cadres, and refusing to eat the food cooked by the village cadres. When we first returned from Party rectification, the old village cadres warmly approached the cadres to inquire about them, but later, seeing that our cadres were very cold, they became suspicious if we didn't seek them out. Gradually, they became indifferent to us and stopped working. When the masses sought them out, they would say, "I don't dare to do it anymore, go find the new cadres!" They also forgot to take care of the middle peasants, not lending them money or asking them to transport grain. Middle peasants in the Second District said, "You talk about uniting the middle peasants, but you will only unite us when we are starving to death!" "You are just talking empty words." Comrades who had not been through Party rectification heard that Party rectification was very strict and were afraid that if they made mistakes, they would add another mistake in future Party rectifications. Based on these thoughts, the County Party Committee put forward the following points to note: (1) Resolutely correct the one-sided poor peasant and hired laborer viewpoint and definitely unite with the middle peasants. In the future, this mistake should be changed in concrete matters. Those who had their class status wrongly determined in the past must be resolutely corrected. In the past, middle peasants suffered losses in requisitions, such as not counting labor when people accompanied livestock on errands, but in the future, it should be counted. Middle peasants should be included in the Production and Disaster Relief Committee; middle peasants who are truly in difficulty and have nothing to eat can be given loans of money and grain, and the middle peasants should be united through various concrete issues. (2) It is right to be careful and cautious, but one should not be afraid of being said that one's stance is not firm or afraid of making mistakes and being punished, and thus not work hard. It is wrong to be bound hand and foot; this is still a selfish calculation, which is the same as not having a firm stance. In the future, it should be made clear that we are serving the people. (3) Regarding the issue of new and old organizations, in the past, the old organizations were kicked aside and ignored, not approached or educated, not seen, and their food was not eaten. Therefore, this caused their panic and fear. It is wrong not to find out the bottom line and not work. We should not only criticize and expose, but also distinguish between good and bad and point out their way out, so that they can reflect well and correct their mistakes. We should treat them warmly; the vast majority of village cadres can be reformed and educated. Good ones should be absorbed to participate in the Production and Disaster Relief Committee, explaining that it is wrong not to work, and the old cadres should still be responsible for the daily work in the village.

　　领导上光找贫雇村干中农都不满
  　高陵检查领导作风
    【冀鲁豫消息】高陵县委于四月二十日，召开各小区干部会座谈思想作风，讨论工作，纠正偏向。经座谈后发现一般干部的思想是工作不大胆，怕犯错误，旧的一套不能用，新的一套没有。有的觉得工作员难当，甚至有个别干部要求调动当伙夫的。整过党的干部，怕人家说贫雇观点不强，立场不稳，对老村干不接近、不教育，认为一窝蜂。也不接近中农，下去后一头碰到贫雇上，不见村干的面，村干做的饭就不吃。开始整党回来，老村干部还是亲亲热热的找到干部问长问短，后来见我们干部很冷淡，有事也不找他就怀疑起来。慢慢的对我们也就冷淡了，也不做工作了。群众有事找他，他们就说：“俺是不敢干啦，找新干部去吧！”对中农也是忘掉了照顾，不贷给他们款，不叫中农运粮。二区中农说：“你说团结中农，等饿死才团结哩！”“你净说空话”。没整过党的同志，听说整党很严，光怕做错了将来整党多添上一条错误。县委会根据这几种思想，提出以下几点注意：（一）坚决纠正片面的贫雇观点，一定团结中农。今后应在具体问题上，转变这一错误。过去定错了成份的，坚决要改过来。过去在支差中中农吃了亏，比如人随牲口出差不算差，今后应该算差。生产救灾委员会，要吸收中农参加；真正困难没吃的中农，可以贷款贷粮，从各种具体问题执行中团结中农。（二）小心谨慎是对的，但不能因为怕说自己立场不稳，怕犯错误受处分而不去好好工作。束手束脚是不对的，这仍是个人主义的打算，这即是立场不稳，今后应明确为人民服务。（三）对新老组织问题，过去对老组织是一脚踢开不管，不接近不教育，不见面，不吃他的饭。因此造成了他们的恐慌害怕，不摸清底不工作，这是不对的。不应光批评揭发，并应区别好坏指出他们的出路，叫他好好反省，改正错误。我们应该热情的对待他们，绝大部分村干是可以改造与教育过来的。对好的应吸收其参加生产救灾委员会，说明不做工作是不对的，老干部仍应负责村内的日常工作。
