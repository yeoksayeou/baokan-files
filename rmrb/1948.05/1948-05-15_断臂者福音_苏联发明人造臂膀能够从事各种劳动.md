Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet inventor Kononov has invented a new method of prosthesis that enables people who have lost their arms to engage in various kinds of labor. Large-scale production of the new artificial arm will begin soon, and all disabled soldiers will be supplied with this artificial arm. Kononov was originally a car driver and mechanic. He became an inventor by designing a method of prosthesis to replace his right arm, which he lost twenty years ago. Dissatisfied with the original artificial arm, he devoted himself to studying the laws of medicine and mechanics, which led to today's invention. The "Kononov arm" has a special device, including mechanical fingers that can pick up tiny objects from the ground, and can perform the work of tinsmiths, lathe workers, carpenters, and agricultural workers. Captain Zickhoff said, "This arm allows me to write, saw wood, chop wood, strike a match, smoke a cigarette, and even operate a machine gun." Nikolai, a circus horse trainer who is also equipped with a "Kononov arm," finds the use of the artificial arm so natural that it is difficult to distinguish it from his other real arm.

    苏联发明人造臂膀能够从事各种劳动
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联发明家科诺诺夫发明新的接缺法，能使失掉臂膀的人从事各种劳动。新的人造臂膀的大规模生产最近就要开始，一切残废军人都将供给以这种人造臂膀。科诺诺夫原是一个汽车司机和机械士，他因设计接缺法以代替他二十年前丧失的右臂而变成了发明家。他不满意原有的人造臂膀，遂致力研究医学和机械学的规律，因而有今天的发明。“科诺诺夫臂膀”有特殊的装置，包括从地下检起细微东西的机械手指，能够从事象锡匠、车床工人、细木匠、农业工人的劳动。齐克霍夫上尉说：“这一臂膀能使我写字、锯木、伐木、擦火柴、抽香烟，甚至开机枪。”另一个配有“科诺诺夫臂膀”的马戏场练马者尼古拉觉得运用假臂非常自然，以至很难与其另一只真臂分辨。
