Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 14th: TASS, Moscow, May 10th: US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 4th of this month, and, on behalf of the US government, issued a statement on US-Soviet relations (see below). On the 9th, Molotov invited Smith to meet with him and, on behalf of the Soviet government, asked him to convey the following statement to the US government. The following is the original text of the statement:

	The Soviet government approves of the desire expressed in the US government's statement to improve the current Soviet-American relations, and agrees with the suggestion of conducting discussions and resolving the existing differences between the two countries for this purpose. At the same time, it must be stated that the Soviet government cannot agree with the US government's opinion that the unsatisfactory state of current Soviet-American relations and the tension in international relations are due to the Soviet Union's policy in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union's increased influence there.

	Regarding the Soviet Union's relations with its neighboring countries and other European countries, significant improvements have indeed occurred after the war. This is demonstrated by the conclusion of treaties of friendship and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and these countries, which are entirely aimed at preventing the recurrence of aggression by Germany and its possible allies. Contrary to the statement of US Ambassador Smith, these treaties do not contain any secret clauses. The Soviet government will continue to pursue this policy of consolidating relations with its neighbors and other European countries in the future. The Soviet government cannot agree with the US government's statement that the US government's diplomatic policies towards other countries have caused dissatisfaction in the Soviet Union due to the Soviet Union's excessive influence in the internal affairs of those countries.

	As for the Eastern European countries implied here, important democratic transformations have occurred there after the war, which constitute a means of defending against new threats of war, thus creating favorable conditions for the development of friendly relations between these countries and the Soviet Union. It would be completely wrong to attribute the democratic transformations that have occurred here to Soviet interference in the internal affairs of the aforementioned countries. This is to ignore the undeniable fact that the aforementioned transformations are a natural result of the victory of democratic forces over Nazism and Fascism, and that the people of Eastern European countries regard it as a guarantee against new threats of war. It is therefore entirely natural for Communists to rise to leading positions, as the people of these countries consider Communists to be the most steadfast fighters against war. The realization of democratic reforms is an internal affair of each country, and no one has the right to dispute this. However, it is clear from the US government's statement that the government holds a different view, and on its own part is engaging in interference in the internal affairs of other countries, which cannot but arouse the dissatisfaction of the Soviet government. The evolution of the situation in Greece is not the only example of such interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

	The US government also uses the Soviet government's attitude towards the so-called European Recovery Program to explain the unsatisfactory state of Soviet-American relations. However, it is quite clear that if the issue of economic recovery in European countries were handled not in the manner of the aforementioned plan, but within the framework of the United Nations, based on the normal conditions of international economic cooperation, and with due respect for national rights and state sovereignty, then the Soviet Union would have no reason to object. Moreover, the Soviet Union is one of the countries that suffered the greatest economic losses during the war, and it is extremely concerned about the development of international economic cooperation after the war.

	*The US builds naval and air bases on a large scale*
	*Cannot be explained as self-defense*

	At the same time, the Soviet government deems it necessary to state that the unsatisfactory state of current Soviet-American relations and the tense international situation are the result of the recent policies of the US government. What has contributed to this tension, first and foremost, are the following actions of the US government: for example, the continuous development of a network of naval and air bases in all parts of the world (including territories adjacent to the Soviet Union). At the same time, American newspapers and certain official representatives have stated without reservation that the establishment of these bases is intended to encircle the Soviet Union. Such measures cannot be explained by the need for self-defense.

	Similarly, it is impossible to ignore another fact, namely that the current international atmosphere is being poisoned by all kinds of belligerent threats against the Soviet Union issued by certain parties closely associated with the US government.

	In addition, the military alliance of the five Western European countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg has recently been formed. From the treaty, it is clear that it is not only aimed at Germany, but also at countries that were allies during the Second World War. All the newspapers in Britain, France, and the United States have openly stated that this alliance is aimed at the Soviet Union. It cannot be ignored that the formation of the aforementioned military alliance was only made possible by the encouragement of the US government. Obviously, the military treaty of the five Western European countries cannot be regarded as a treaty of self-defense.

	The US government's unfriendly policy towards the Soviet Union is also manifested in Soviet-American trade. According to the trade agreement concluded between our two countries, the US government should not impose any rules or regulations on the export of American goods to the Soviet Union that are more stringent than those applied to any third country. However, the US government's current policy completely violates the Soviet-American trade agreement and discriminates against the Soviet Union. As a result, although the Soviet Union has prepaid deposits or even made full payments for goods purchased, the export of American goods to the Soviet Union has been interrupted. It is quite clear that this situation is absolutely intolerable.

	Now the US government claims that the United States has no hostile or aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union and expresses the hope of finding a way to establish good and reasonable relations between our two countries, while thoroughly easing international tensions. The Soviet government of course welcomes this statement from the US government; because the Soviet government has consistently pursued a policy of peace and cooperation with the United States. The Soviet government declares that it will continue to pursue this policy with complete steadfastness in the future. The Soviet government also expresses the hope that it will be possible to seek various ways to eliminate existing differences and establish good relations between our two countries, in line with the interests of our two peoples and the cause of consolidating universal peace.

	*US Government's Statement to the Soviet Union*

	Smith made a statement during his visit to Molotov on the 4th, stating: "The US government wishes to formally raise a matter that it considers very important: First, the US government's policy in international affairs has been very clear recently and will strive to follow in the future. Domestic political issues, such as the upcoming elections, will not affect this policy. The economic crisis will not affect the basic factors on which US foreign policy is based. Second, the US government wishes to state that the United States has no hostile or aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union. Furthermore, if the Soviet Union wishes to live in peace with its neighbors and does not attempt to exert excessive influence, directly or indirectly, on their affairs, then the United States will not have any adverse impact on the interests of the Soviet Union. To be precise: many elements of the US policy that are currently causing such sharp opposition from the Soviet side would not have emerged if it were not for the need for the United States to help other countries to safeguard the political integrity of each country and prevent attempts by communist minority parties to seize power and establish regimes subservient to foreign interests. To this day, the United States has not abandoned the hope that there will be a turning point in the development of the situation that will enable the United States to find a way to establish good and reasonable relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, while thoroughly easing the tensions that are having such an adverse impact on international relations everywhere. As far as the United States is concerned, the door is always open for detailed discussion and resolution of disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union." and so on.

### 美国应负国际局势紧张之责　苏联发表重要声明  揭穿美对苏敌视或侵略意图

　　美国应负国际局势紧张之责
  　苏联发表重要声明
    揭穿美对苏敌视或侵略意图
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十日电：美驻苏大使史密斯于本月四日访问苏外长莫洛托夫，受美政府之命对于美苏关系发表声明（见后）。莫洛托夫于九日邀会史密斯，奉苏联政府之命，请他将下述声明转告美政府。下为声明原文：
    苏联政府赞成美政府声明中所表示想改善目前苏美关系的愿望，并同意由于这一目的而进行讨论并解决两国间现存分歧的建议。同时，必须声明：美国政府认为目前苏美关系不能令人满意的情况和国际关系的紧张，其原因乃是苏联在东欧的政策以及苏联在那里业已增长的影响云云，则不能同意。
    关于苏联与其邻国以及欧洲其他各国的关系，在战后的确大有改进。这表现于苏联和这些国家之间友好互助条约的缔结上，这些条约完全以防止德国及其可能的盟国的侵略的重演为目的，这些条约与美大使史密斯的声明相反，并没有任何秘密条款。苏联政府将来仍要奉行这种巩固与邻国及欧洲其他国家的关系的政策。美政府的声明说，美政府对别的国家所采取的外交政策引起苏联不满的步骤，其原因乃是苏联在那些国家内政上的过份影响云云，苏联政府不能同意这种解释。
    至于这里所意味的东欧各国，战后已发生重要的民主转变，这种转变构成了防御新战争威胁的手段，因此给这些国家与苏联间的友好关系的发展造成有利的条件。要是把这里业已发生的民主转变归因于苏联干涉上述各国的内政，那就完全错误了。这便是无视于不容置疑的事实，即上述转变乃是民主力量战胜纳粹主义与法西斯主义的自然结果，而且东欧各国人民把它认为防御新战争威胁的保证。由此可见，共产党人之升居领导地位是完全自然的，因为这些国家的人民认为共产党人是反对战争的最坚定不移的斗士。民主改革的实现，乃是每一个国家的内政问题，这一点谁也没有权利诡辩。然而从美政府声明中可以明白看到：该政府持有不同的看法，而在它本身方面则实行着对他国内政的干涉，这就不得不引起苏联政府的不满。希腊局势的演变，并非这种干涉他国内政的唯一例证。
    美政府又以苏联政府对所谓欧洲复兴计划的态度来解释苏美关系不能令人满意的情况。然而，十分明白，要是欧洲各国经济复兴问题的处理，不是用上述计划的方式，而是在联合国组织的范围内，根据国际经济合作的正常情况，并且对民族权利与国家主权予以应有的尊重的话，那末，苏联就没有理由反对；况且苏联是战时遭受经济损失最大的国家之一，它对于战后国际经济合作的发展，是极其关怀的。
　　美广建海空军基地
    绝不能解释为自卫
    同时，苏联政府认为必须声明：目前苏美关系不能令人满意的情况与国际关系的紧张局势，是美政府最近政策引起的结果。助成这种紧张局势的，首先便是美国政府下述的行动：例如在全球一切部分（包括毗邻苏联的领土在内）不断发展海空军基地网，同时，美国报纸和某些官方代表毫无忌讳地说：这些基地之建立乃是为了要包围苏联。这种措施，不能用自卫的需要来解释。
    同样也不可能忽视另一事实，即目前国际间的气氛正遭受着由于与美国政府有密切关系的某方人士针对苏联所发出的各式各样的好战威胁的毒害。
    另外，西欧英法比荷卢五国的军事联盟最近业已组成。从其条约看来，便已显然，并非只指德国而且同样可以针对那些第二次大战中曾为盟国的国家。英法美全部报纸都公开说这一联盟是针对苏联的。不能忽视：组成上述军事联盟之所以成为可能，只是由于美国政府的鼓励。显然，西欧五国的军事条约，绝不能认为是自卫条约。
    美政府对苏不友好的政策，也表现在苏美贸易上。按照我们两国间所缔结的贸易协定，美政府在美国商品对苏输出上，不应施行任何较之其施行于任何第三国的更为苛刻的规则或章程。然而美国政府的现行政策，完全违反苏美贸易协定而对苏歧视。结果，虽然苏联所购货物已预付定钱或甚至全部付款，可是美货对苏的出口却遭中断。十分明显，这种情势是绝不能容忍的。
    现在美政府声称美国对苏并无任何敌视或侵略意图，并表示希望能够找到建立我们两国间良好而合理的关系的道路，同时彻底缓和国际间的紧张局势。苏联政府当然欢迎美国政府这一声明；因为苏联政府一贯奉行对美和平与合作的政策。苏联政府声明：在将来也将完全坚定不移地奉行这一政策。苏联政府也表示希望：寻求各种方法，消除现存的分歧，建立我们两国间的良好关系，以符合我们两国人民的利益，和巩固普遍和平的事业，这将是可能的。
    美政府对苏声明
    史密斯于四日在访问莫洛托夫时曾作一声明略称：“美政府愿正式提出它认为很重要的问题：第一、美政府在国际事务方面的政策，近来已十分明确，在将来也将竭力奉行。国内政治方面的问题，例如即将到来的选举等将不会影响这一政策。经济危机不会影响美国外交政策所依据的基本因素。第二、美国政府愿说明，美国对苏联并没有任何敌视或侵略的意图。此外，假如苏联愿望与其邻国和平共处，并且不企图以直接或间接的过份影响加于它们的事务的话，则美国不会对苏联的利益有什么不利的影响。确切些说：在目前引起苏联方面这样尖锐反对的美国政策，其中有许多要素，如果不是因为美国需要帮助他国，以保障各该国政治上完整性，阻止共产主义少数党夺取政权并建立服从外国利益的政权的企图的话，那么，美国政策中那些要素就不会出现。直至今天为止，美国还没有放弃如次的希望：希望能在时局发展中有一个这样的转折，即将使美国能够找到建立美苏两国间良好而合理的关系的道路，同时彻底缓和目前在各地国际关系上发生这样不利影响的紧张局势。就美国来说，详尽讨论并解决美苏间分歧之斗是经常洞开着的。”云云。
