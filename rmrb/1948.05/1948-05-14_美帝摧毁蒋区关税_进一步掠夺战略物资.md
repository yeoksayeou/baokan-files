    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: According to various sources, the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek sides simultaneously announced on the 4th that the Geneva Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would take effect on the 22nd of this month. This agreement, signed by twenty-two countries on October 30th of last year, was initiated by U.S. imperialism and aimed to destroy the protective tariffs of various countries, stipulating the reduction of import tax rates on more than five hundred kinds of commodities to facilitate the dumping of American goods. Truman revealed in his announcement on the 4th of this month that, in order to implement the agreement, the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek sides had signed a "Provisional Implementation Draft" of the general agreement on the 21st of last month. The draft is based on the interests of U.S. imperialist aggression, stipulating that the Chiang side must reduce the import tax rates on American industrial products exported to China (such as vehicles, railcars, radios, etc.) and surplus agricultural products (wheat, flour, cotton, tobacco, etc.), while the U.S. side also reduces or exempts the import tax rates on Chinese raw materials exported to the U.S., especially strategic materials (such as iron, antimony, tin, tung oil, etc.). The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in order to please its American masters, rushed to sign the draft of this agreement. According to a United States Information Service dispatch from Washington: "China (referring to the Chiang bandits) is the first country to make the agreement effective and the first country in the Far East to make the agreement effective."

    美帝摧毁蒋区关税
    进一步掠夺战略物资
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据各方消息：美蒋双方已于四日同时宣布日内瓦关税及贸易协定自本月二十二日起生效。由二十二个国家于去年十月三十日签订的此一协定系由美帝所发动，旨在摧毁各国的保护关税，规定减低五百余种商品之进口税率，以便美货倾销。杜鲁门于本月四日的公告中宣露：为实施该协定，美蒋双方已于上月二十一日签订总协定的“临时实施草案”。草案基于美帝侵略利益，规定蒋方须减低美国输华工业品（如车辆、车皮、无线电等）及过剩农产品（小麦、面粉、棉花、烟草等）之进口税率，美方亦减免中国输美之原料品特别是战略物资（如铁、锑、锡、桐油等）的进口税率。蒋介石匪帮为讨好其美国主子，曾抢先签订是项协定的草案。据美国新闻处华盛顿电称：“中国（按指蒋匪）为使该协定生效的第一个国家，亦为远东各国第一个使该协定生效者”。
