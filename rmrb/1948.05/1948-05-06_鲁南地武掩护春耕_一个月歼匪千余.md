Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th: Local armed forces in Southern Shandong are taking the initiative to attack, recovering vast rural areas between Si (Shui) Fei (County) Zi (Yang) and north of Si (Shui), and pressing towards the Jinpu and Linzao lines to cover the spring planting of the masses. The people's armed forces of the First Sub-district (seven counties including Fei, Zou, and Teng) have captured bandit strongholds such as Zhongcun, Bianqiao, Chengqian, Guoliji, and Qingnigou southeast of Sishui in half a month since March 13, controlling more than 150 li of the Lin (Yi) Zi (Yang) highway, and once attacked Sishui city, annihilating more than 500 enemies in total. Another unit advanced into the area north of Si (Shui), sweeping away local Chiang bandits, restoring 300 villages, and repeatedly repelling three raids by Chiang bandits to seize grain, annihilating more than 100 enemies. The area north of Sishui city, 30 li from north to south and nearly 100 li from east to west, is now free of enemy traces. Farmers in this area and north of Pingyi are rushing to plant crops. At the same time, the soldiers and civilians in Zhao @ County, Feng County, Teng County and other places in the Third Sub-district are squeezing the bandits and puppets on the Jinpu and Linzao lines. They annihilated most of the Lanling District Squadron of bandits in Liujing, northeast of Feng County; annihilated more than 200 local Chiang bandits in Nanbeijiangshang, north of Pi County; and repelled two raids by bandits to seize grain in Shangu and Dujiaoshan, more than ten li southeast of Teng County, annihilating 150 enemies below the battalion commander level; annihilated a part of the puppet Bao Gong Office and puppet police in Ganlin and Xiazhuang area south of Zaozhuang, and once forced back the bandit stronghold in Sangcun, 20 li east of Teng County. In total, more than 1,400 bandits and puppets were annihilated in various places in March. The enthusiasm of farmers for production is high, and they are stepping up spring planting.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th: The first phase of spring repairs on the Yellow River in the Bohai area has been completed. This phase of the project began in mid-March and ended after the Qingming Festival. A total of more than 43,000 civilian workers from 16 counties, including Kenli (Xin County, formerly northeast of Lijin), Lijin, and Guangrao, were mobilized, using more than 780,000 cubic meters of earth (each cubic meter), as well as a huge amount of bricks, wooden stakes, and straw. A total of 680,000 workdays were used. In leading the river works, Huimin County adopted a method of calculating wages and food based on earthwork, and used blackboard newspapers to commend models and carry out meritorious service campaigns, which improved work efficiency. Jiyang County proposed to cadres to perform meritorious service in harnessing the Yellow River to rectify the party, overcoming the cadres' simple supervision of work, working with the river workers to carry soil, and promoting the river works. Both of the above counties have now not only completed the first phase of the plan, but have also completed the second phase of earthwork. During the spring repairs, Chiang bandits constantly conspired to sabotage, colluding with the puppet "Returning Home Corps" to disrupt the dike repair project in the Jiyang area. Chiang planes also came from time to time to harass, indiscriminately bombing and strafing, injuring eight civilian workers and killing two, and killing four cattle and destroying two boats. The democratic government and the river management office have given condolences to the families of the martyrs and given compensation to the injured.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th: The soldiers and civilians in the Huaihai District of Northern Jiangsu are rushing to repair the dikes of the Liutang, Chaimi, Shajian, and Dajian rivers to protect spring wheat. The above-mentioned river dikes have been repeatedly sabotaged by Chiang bandits since last autumn, with many breaches. On the 11th of this month, affected by the spring alkali of the Grand Canal, the water level of each river rose sharply by six to ten feet. The water of the Shajian River within Suqian breached the dikes in five places, including Yaowan, submerging more than 3,100 mu of wheat. After more than 3,000 people repaired the breaches day and night, the breaches were blocked, and 20,000 mu of wheat fields along the coast were saved from disaster. Peiwu Township in Si (Shui) Shu (Yang) County also blocked nine breaches in the Shajian River, saving 950 mu of wheat fields. When the Liutang and Chaimi rivers submerged the wheat seedlings on the river滩, Tang, the district chief of Lihang District, personally led more than 400 people to repair the breaches all night, and the situation turned from danger to safety. The water level of each river gradually dropped on the 15th, and the soldiers and civilians in various places are still taking the opportunity to repair the breaches.
