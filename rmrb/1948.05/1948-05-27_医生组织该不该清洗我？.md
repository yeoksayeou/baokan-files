　　Should the Doctors' Organization Purge Me? Comrade Editor:
　　People say I am a person with "political problems" (I participated in the Kuomintang). Let me tell you about my three generations: My grandfather burned lime and farmed. By my father's generation, he was farming other people's land (rented). My uncle was a hired laborer, forced to death by the landlord. When I was little, my family had many people but little land (eleven and a half mu of land, nine people). I studied in elementary school for a few years, and at fifteen, I went to a pharmacy in Northeast China as a shop assistant. I suffered the most severe exploitation every year. I lived in the Northeast for eleven years and learned some medical skills (traditional Chinese medicine). Then the September 18th Incident happened. I was unwilling to be enslaved by the Japanese invaders, so I returned home. At the same time, I raised some money in the village and opened a pharmacy, also practicing medicine. I farmed two mu of land myself (inherited from the family division, two people), and I could make a living. I had a landlord relative in the Kuomintang. He promoted it to me, telling me to join the Kuomintang. He said that everyone would have to join the Kuomintang in the future, otherwise they would have no status, and he would be conscripted first in the future (around 1937 or 1938). So I registered my name, and I also introduced seven or eight other people (all farmers). He never gave us any licenses, nor did we attend any meetings. Since the establishment of the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government, I immediately confessed in detail to the village cadres during the anti-spy campaigns, and I also wrote several self-criticisms. Since then, the village cadres have treated me differently, but I have always practiced medicine in the village as always. No matter who called me, I arrived late when called late, and I arrived early when called early. I have not been assigned any errands in the village. Last month, the doctors' organization in my district purged me (in principle, purging landlords), and errands were also added to me. Now I have two children and my wife, four people in total. I farm two mu of land, living in three dilapidated houses (formerly a landlord's sheepfold, obtained as spoils), and the pharmacy cannot be opened either, so it is difficult to maintain a living. The day before yesterday, I was sent on a long trip (half a month), which was waived only after I repeatedly requested. My conduct was not good in the past few years, and my relationship with my wife was not good. I was a bit of a rogue (affairs with women). In recent years, I have had two young children, and my relationship with my wife has improved. Now I have changed. The above is my historical situation, and there is nothing empty about it. Most of the peasants in my village have turned over. What kind of household am I? Can I participate in the doctors' organization? Should the errands be exempted? I hope for a reply.

Wang Qingliang:
　　As you stated in your letter, your main occupation is practicing medicine and running a pharmacy. Naturally, you can participate in the doctors' organization. It was inappropriate for the doctors' organization to purge you in the past. If you participated in the Kuomintang in the past but have not engaged in counter-revolutionary activities since the establishment of the democratic government and have confessed and repented, you should no longer be considered a criminal or to have political problems. As you said, your individual class status should be that of a self-employed person, and your family's class status should be determined based on its possession and use of the means of production. As for the errand issue, if it was stipulated in the past that you would not be assigned errands, and you are still performing medical duties now, you can consult with the district office. At the same time, you mentioned that the pharmacy cannot be opened either, but I don't know why, so I cannot answer.

### 医生组织该不该清洗我？

　　医生组织该不该清洗我？编报同志：
    人家说我是个有“政治问题”的人（我参加过国民党），我把我的三代说说：我祖父烧石灰种地，到我父亲时种人家的地（租的），叔父当长工，是被地主逼死的，我小时家里人多地少（地十一亩半、人九口），我在初小念过几年书，十五岁就往东三省药行当小店员去了。每年受到最刻薄的剥削。我在东北住了十一年，学了一些医术（中医），就赶上九一八事变。我不愿在那里受日寇的奴役，就返回家来了。同时在村里揭了些钱，开了个药铺，兼行医，自己种的二亩地（分家分的，人两口），生活顾住了。我有一门地主亲戚在国民党，他向我宣传，叫我参加国民党。他说今后任何人都得参加国民党，否则就没地位，将来征兵就要先征他（民国廿六、七年时候）。我就上了个名，另外我还介绍了七、八个人（都是农民）。俺这伙人他也没有给过啥执照，也没去那开过会。自从抗日民主政府成立，各地反特，我就马上向村干部详细坦白一下，还具过几回反省书。自此，村干部就另眼看待我，但我在村里行医始终如一。不管谁叫我，迟叫迟到，早叫早到。在村里我也没有支过啥差。前月我区医生组织把我清洗出来了（原则上清地主），差务也给加上了。现在我有两个小孩和我的老婆四口人，种的二亩多地，住三间破房子（是地主羊圈，得的果实），药铺亦不能开了，生活不好维持。前天出差，偏要叫我出远差（半月时间），经我再三要求才免。我前几年作风不好，与我老婆感情不好，我就是有点流氓习气（男女关系事）。近几年我有了两个小孩子，我和我老婆感情好了，现在我就转变了。以上我的历史情况就是这样，并没一点空洞地方。我村农民大部都翻了身，我算个啥户？医生组织能否参加？差务该免不该？希答复。　　　　　磁县五区索井　王清良王清良：
    确如你来信所谈，你的主要职业是行医开药铺，自然可以参加医生组织，过去医生组织清洗你是不妥当的，过去参加过国民党，民主政府成立后没有反革命活动，已经坦白反省的，就不应再认为犯罪或有政治问题。如你所说情况，你个人的成份应是自由职业者，你家庭的成份则依据其对于生产资料的占有状况与使用状况决定。至于差务问题，若过去规定你不支差，而现在你仍然执行医生业务的话，可商请区公所办理。同时你提到药铺也不能开了，不知是为什么，无法答复。
