Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Amidst the soaring prices in the Chiang-controlled areas, the price of rice in Shanghai has made another astonishing leap. According to Reuters, the wholesale price of rice reached 7 million (Chiang currency, same below) per stone on the 24th, while the retail price was as high as 7.5 million. From the 22nd, it rose by a huge amount of 1 million to 1.5 million in two days. In rice-producing areas such as Suzhou and Wuxi, prices are also rising wildly, and the current price of rice has risen to 6.8 million per stone.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: The Chiang Kai-shek's four major families monopolized overseas remittances and lowered the exchange rate, resulting in a sharp decline in overseas remittances in the first quarter of this year. According to the Bank of China of the Song family (according to the bank's monopoly on all international inward remittance business in the Chiang-controlled area), the bank's income from overseas Chinese remittances from various places in March was more than 29.3 billion yuan (Chiang currency, same below), a decrease of 700 million yuan from 30 billion yuan in February, a decrease of more than 2.3 percent; a decrease of more than 50 percent compared with the total amount of overseas Chinese remittances of more than 60.8 billion yuan in January.
