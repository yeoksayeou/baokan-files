Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 5th. Frontline reporters report: Chiang Kai-shek's bandits arbitrarily slaughtered the people in the Chang (Le) Wei (County) An (Qiu) area. In Li Jiaying Village, Zifang District, north of Wei (County) alone, over a hundred people were buried alive. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits often set up twelve guillotines at the street entrances of Dongzhuang Village. The three families of the poor peasant Han Zailin and his brothers, totaling fourteen people, were all killed. The two-year-old child of the women's chairman was chopped into three pieces. The family of Han Jicheng in Zifang Village, thirteen people in total, have been completely wiped out. His wife, who was fully pregnant, was giving birth on the edge of the kang, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits threw her and the baby into a pit and buried them alive. Yu Chuandi's mother in Gaoli District had her hair pulled out, her calves cut open, salt rubbed in, and then she was beaten to death. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits extorted exorbitant taxes, with the so-called "two not take," meaning "do not take when people are not breathing, and do not take when beehives grow under the pot." Every unit of land was forced to provide more than 1,700 jin of wheat for land tax. Villages near Douchang Town were extorted more than 200 jin of grain per mu this spring. There were frequent cases of people being forced to jump into wells or hang themselves because they could not pay the grain. Most of the grain in the villages north of Wei was looted, and strong laborers and livestock were captured. In Taoguanzhuang, only over two hundred households had more than one hundred and sixty strong laborers captured, and twenty-eight small villages in Bozi District had more than seven hundred livestock taken away. The spring famine is now extremely serious in various places. When the People's Liberation Army victoriously advanced this time, the people in various places rose up to accuse Chiang Kai-shek's bandits of their crimes and demanded that our army severely punish the murderers. The broad masses also enthusiastically served as guides, automatically helped the army arrange barracks, prepare firewood and grass, and actively supported our army in combat.

　　蒋匪盘踞昌潍地区时
  　群众惨遭活埋刀铡
    【新华社华东前线五日电】前线记者报导：蒋匪在昌（乐）潍（县）安（邱）地区恣意屠杀人民，仅潍（县）北一带纸房区李家营村即被活埋百余人。蒋匪在东庄村各街口经常摆设铡刀十二把，贫农韩在林兄弟三家共十四口全被杀尽，妇女会长两岁的小孩子被铡成三段。纸房村韩继成一家十三口已被杀绝，其妻因怀孕已足月，在炕沿生产，蒋匪即连同婴儿丢入坑内活埋。高里区于传弟之老母被匪拔去头发，割开小腿，擦上盐，然后活活打死。蒋匪横征暴敛，有所谓“两不拿”，即“人不喘气了不拿，锅底下长了蜂网不拿”。每两田赋强征麦子一千七百斤以上，都昌镇附近村庄今春每亩地即被勒索粮食二百余斤。各地时有因交不起粮被逼跳井或上吊者，潍北各村粮食大部被抢光，壮丁与牲口被抓走。陶官庄仅二百多户即被抓去壮丁一百六十多名，泊子区二十八个小村被拉走牲口七百多头。现各地春荒极严重。此次解放军胜利进军时，各地人民群起控诉蒋匪罪行，要求我军严惩凶手。广大群众并踊跃担任向导，自动帮助军队安排营舍，筹备柴草，积极支援我军作战。
