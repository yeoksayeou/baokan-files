Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th. A certain iron factory in Harbin has gained preliminary experience in experimenting with piece-rate bonuses for exceeding quotas. The factory stipulates that, under certain conditions of tools, number of people, and time, the basic number of pieces of products and their quality standards are set. Workers are awarded a certain amount of bonus for each piece exceeding the standard. Regarding the production of a certain type of machinery in the factory, according to statistics for the three months before the implementation of this bonus system, the average production of each set required 5.8 work hours. In the first month after the implementation of the bonus system, the average was 10.7 work hours per set. In the second month, the average dropped to 8.4 work hours per set. In the third month, with the addition of three types of common tools, the average dropped further to 3.7 work hours per set.

    For example, regarding the production of another type of machinery, before the implementation of piece-rate bonuses for exceeding quotas, the average requirement was 12.7 work hours per unit. After the implementation of piece-rate bonuses for exceeding quotas, the average dropped to 5.4 work hours per unit.

    The advantages of this type of piece-rate bonus for exceeding quotas are: it stimulates the workers' production enthusiasm and promotes technological progress, gradually increasing production volume. For production managers, it allows them to quickly become familiar with the intensity of production and grasp the basic standards of production volume. In places where there is no work foundation and workers have not yet been mobilized, it can only play a role in stimulating production. However, in places where there is a work foundation and workers have already been mobilized, it can play a dual role of political and material encouragement.

    Regarding the shortcomings that have been discovered: (1) If the intensity of production is not well understood, the basic standards may be set too high or too low, resulting in unexpected excess or failure to complete the basic production volume. (2) Tools and materials are easily damaged. (3) It easily deepens the workers' simple idea of earning bonuses. Regarding the methods to overcome the shortcomings, the factory has preliminarily explored the following points: First, in departments with a work foundation or where workers have already been mobilized, this bonus method must be combined with emulation drives. Second, in departments without a work foundation or where workers have not yet been mobilized, it is necessary to consult with the workers to adjust the basic production volume every one or two months, and implement a strict finished product inspection system. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen education so that this bonus system is gradually combined with the emulation drives. Combining bonuses with emulation can enable workers to not only strive for bonuses, but also consciously cherish tools and materials, pay attention to quality, and help others complete tasks. When the production volume exceeds too much, the workers will also voluntarily propose to increase the basic production volume. For example, the basic production volume of a certain production team in the iron factory in the first month was 39 sets, in the second month the workers voluntarily increased it to 50 sets, in the third month voluntarily increased it to 60 sets, and in the fourth month voluntarily increased it to 80 sets. They also voluntarily donated a batch of bonuses to comfort the troops or help workers in need.

### 哈市某铁工厂  获得按件奖励经验

    哈市某铁工厂
    获得按件奖励经验
    【新华社东北十三日电】哈尔滨某铁工厂实验超额按件奖励获得初步经验。该厂规定：在一定的工具、一定的人数、一定的时间条件下，定出生产品的基本件数及其质量标准，超出者每件以若干奖金奖予工人。该厂某种机械的生产，在未实行此种奖励前三个月的统计，平均生产每套需要五六点八个工的时间。实行奖励办法后，第一个月平均每套为十点七个工。第二个月平均每套降到八点四个工。第三个月，增加三种普通工具，平均每套又降到三点七个工。
    又如另一种机械的生产，未实行超额按件奖励，平均每架需要十二点七个工。实行超额按件奖励后，平均每架降为五点四个工。
    此种超额按件奖励的优点是：刺激了工人的生产热情，并刺激了技术的进步，使生产量逐步提高。对于生产管理者，则可以因而很快的熟悉生产力的强度，掌握了生产量的基本标准，在没有工作基础和工人尚未发动的地方，只能起一种对刺激生产的作用；但在有了工作基础和工人已发动了的地方，则可起政治鼓舞和物质鼓舞的双重作用。
    关于缺点方面已发现的有：（一）如果不熟悉生产强度，在订基本标准时容易订的太高或太低，故有时发生意外的超额或不能完成基本产量的弊病。（二）工具材料容易受损失。（三）容易加深工人的单纯的挣奖金思想。关于克服缺点的办法，该厂初步摸索出以下几点：一、在有工作基础或工人已发动了的部门，必须使这种奖励法与立功竞赛相结合；二、在没有工作基础或工人尚未发动的部门，必须与工人商定隔一个月或两个月的时间将基本生产量加以调整，并实行严格的检验成品制，同时须抓紧教育，使这种奖励逐步与立功竞赛相结合。奖励与立功结合，可使工人不只是单纯的为得奖金而努力，而能自觉的爱护工具材料，注意质量，并帮助别人完成任务。当生产量超过太多时，工友亦会自愿的提出把基本生产量再提高一些。如铁工厂某生产小组第一个月基本生产量是三十九套，第二个月工友自愿的提高到五十套，第三个月自愿的提高到六十套，第四个月又自愿的提高到八十套，并且自愿拿出一批奖金劳军，或帮助有困难的工友。
