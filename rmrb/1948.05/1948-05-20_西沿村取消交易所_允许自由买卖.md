　　【Yongnian News】Xiyancun in the second district of Yongnian, in order to restrict middle peasants from buying things last year, the village chief, the head of the farmers' association and other eight village cadres formed a farmers' association exchange. Since its establishment, the original fifteen or sixteen brokers have lost their jobs, and the masses cannot trade freely. After the work team arrived in the village, the masses reported: "To buy or sell in our village, you have to find Dai Ziqing (head of the farmers' association) in the west, and Cheng Biaobang in the east. If you can't find these two people, no one dares to sell anything." Other brokers dare not complete transactions. Grandpa Ergou finalized a deal to sell rice for someone, but the village cadres came and said, "If you sell something, the farmers' association is not responsible." These words scared him so much that he didn't sell it. The work team accepted the opinions of the masses, and in the village cadre meeting, they examined the harm the exchange had caused to the masses. After discussion, they unanimously agreed to immediately cancel it and allow free trade. After the cancellation was announced at the mass meeting, everyone was satisfied, especially the old brokers were happy. The general public reflected: "We are not restricted anymore, we can trade freely." (Xiao)

　　西沿村取消交易所
  　允许自由买卖
    【永年消息】永年二区西沿村，去年为限制中农买东西，由村长、农会长等八个村干，组成了农会交易所。自成立后，原来十五六个经纪，都失了业，群众也不能自由买卖。工作组到村后，群众反映：“俺村买卖，西头得找到代自青（农会长），东头得找到程表邦，找不到这两个人，谁也不敢卖东西。”别的经纪谁也不敢成交，二狗爷爷给人家成交大米，把价说好了，村干去了说：“你卖东西，农会不负责”。这一句话，吓得不卖了。工作组接受了群众意见，就在村干会上检讨交易所对群众的害处，经过讨论一致意见要立即取消，允许买卖自由。在群众大会上宣布取消后，人人满意，特别是旧的经纪，更是高兴。一般群众反映：“不受卡了，可以自由买卖啦”。　（萧）
