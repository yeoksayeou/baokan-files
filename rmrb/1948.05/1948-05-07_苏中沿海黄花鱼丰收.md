Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th -- An unprecedented abundant harvest of yellow croaker has occurred in the coastal areas of central Jiangsu. For example, the first batch of 34 fishing boats from Rugao East County have returned to port one after another, carrying 10,000 dan (100 jin per dan) of fish. Farmers from far and near have organized themselves in groups to rush to the coast to purchase and transport the fish. The democratic government has specially formed a price negotiation committee composed of small fishermen's associations, boat owners, fishmongers, and fishery tax offices in various fishing markets. Prices are democratically discussed and evaluated before the market opens each day, ensuring that merchants, boat owners, and boatmen all obtain certain profits. Therefore, the sale of fish is extremely smooth. According to fishermen, this year's yellow croaker production is the most abundant in history. A single net can fill the entire hold, and three or four large nets have even been broken by the schools of fish. Even when the tide washes onto the beach, schools of fish come along, and fresh fish can be picked up everywhere. Currently, it is still the first wave, and according to past practice, the second wave will be even larger. The democratic government previously issued 80 million yuan in fishing loans, 1,000 dan of salt, and 400 dan of cotton to solve the difficulties of fishermen. At the same time, it widely publicized the policy of developing the fishing industry, corrected biases in land reform, returned confiscated sea boats to their original owners, and the People's Liberation Army's fishing armed forces also patrolled the sea to protect fishing. Therefore, the morale of fishermen in various places is extremely high this year. Another piece of information: the democratic government has recently allocated 40 million yuan in Central China currency to fishermen in Xinyang and Doulong ports in Yancheng East County, northern Jiangsu, and more than 10 million yuan in North Sea currency to fishermen in Shijiusuo, Binhai, to help them repair boats and acquire nets, so that they can go to sea during the fish tide.

　　苏中沿海黄花鱼丰收
    【新华社华东四日电】苏中沿海黄花鱼空前丰收。如（皋）东县首批三十四艘渔船已陆续返港，载鱼达一万担（每担一百市斤），远近农民纷纷组织起来，成群结队赶往海口购运，民主政府特在各渔市联小渔行、船主、渔贩及渔税办事处组成议价委员会，于每日开市前经民主讨论评定鱼价，使商贩、船主、船工均获一定利润，因此渔销极为畅利。据渔民谈，今年黄花鱼产之丰为历年未有，一网即可满舱，有三、四口大网被鱼群冲破，甚至海水冲上海滩时亦涌来鱼群，到处可拾得鲜鱼。目前尚系头泛，照往年常例二泛将更多。按民主政府曾于鱼泛前发放渔贷八千万元，盐一千担，棉花四百担等，解决渔民困难。同时普遍宣传发展渔业政策，并纠正土改中偏向，将被错误没收的海船发还原主，解放军渔上武装亦出海巡弋，保护捕鱼，故各地渔民今年生产情绪极高。另息：民主政府近又拨华中币四千万元贷给苏北盐（城）东县新洋、斗龙两港渔民，及北海币一千余万元贷给滨海石臼所渔民，帮助修船置网，俾趁鱼泛下海。
