Weekly Battle Situation

　　Our First Corps of the North China Field Army captured the important town of Linfen in southern Shanxi on the night of the 17th, completely annihilating the defending enemy, Chiang bandit's 30th Division, Yan bandit's 66th Division, and training regiments and security regiments, totaling thirteen regiments. By this point, the last stronghold of the Chiang-Yan bandit army in southern Shanxi has been eliminated, and southern Shanxi has been completely liberated. Yan Xishan even emboldened himself on the 15th, saying, "The outer perimeter of the city is secure, the defending forces are strong, and the battle of Linfen is by no means pessimistic." But as soon as he said this, Linfen was liberated by us the next day.
　　The powerful offensive of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army in western Wan began on the first of this month and concluded victoriously with the capture of Deng County on the 10th. In this campaign, we captured four county towns, including Neixiang, Xichuan, Zhenping, and Deng County, and seven important towns, including Xixiakou, Xiping Town, Jingziguan, Yuwangdian, Liguanqiao, Houyang Town, and Chongyangdian, liberating more than 50,000 square miles of territory. We annihilated the entire 226th Regiment of the 76th Brigade of Chiang bandit's 9th Division and most of thirteen security regiments, totaling 9,922 men. The thirteen counties of Wan have historically been ruled by Henan's reactionary landlord armed forces, and the four counties of western Wan are the nests of reactionary landlord armed forces. The Kuomintang has repeatedly boasted that they are a model of feudal military rule, and Bai Chongxi bowed to them in his military report to the pseudo-National Assembly. Since our army entered the Hubei-Shaanxi-Henan theater, the reactionary landlord armed forces in various places have suffered continuous and severe blows. On January 16th this year, when we first liberated Deng County, we annihilated eleven security regiments with more than 8,000 men. After this battle, the "elite teams" treasured by Chiang bandits are almost completely wiped out, which has profound significance for the liberation of Henan, especially western Wan. At present, our army is continuing to mop up the remnants of the bandits, and the Chiang bandits in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border area will soon be completely eliminated.
　　On the 11th, the Central Plains People's Liberation Army recaptured Suiping City on the Pinghan Railway, and on the night of the 14th, it liberated Xuchang City for the fourth time, completely annihilating the three regiments of the Independent 21st Brigade, hastily pieced together by the local Chiang bandit's No. 1 Regiment, which had been entrenched in the city for less than a week, as well as the pseudo-Henan Provincial Fifth Special Commissioner's Office and the Xuchang and Xiangcheng County governments, capturing alive Brigade Commander and Commissioner Fan Ren and others, totaling 2,274 men. Another unit of our army also recaptured Xingyang City on the 13th, completely annihilating the 1st Regiment headquarters, directly subordinate units, and two complete battalions of the defending enemy's Provisional 26th Brigade, killing and capturing more than 680 men. The Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Military Region's armed forces also recovered Woyang City on April 18th, annihilating more than 800 defending enemies.
　　While liberating Changyi, Weifang, and Anqiu, the Shandong Corps of the East China People's Liberation Army also defeated Wang Yaowu and Ding Zhipan's six divisions, eleven brigades, and two security regiments of the Kuomintang army, which were attacking from the eastern and western ends of the Jiaoji Railway to reinforce the area, and annihilated 4,763 of them. We recovered important towns such as Zhangdian and Zhoucun, consolidating the great victory in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway.
　　The military and civilians in Central China have initially defeated Chiang bandit's overall war strategy, annihilating more than 5,000 enemies. On the 6th, the local armed forces in central Jiangsu took advantage of the victory to capture Huihe Town in Qidong, completely annihilating the defending enemy, and defeating two traffic police battalions of bandits coming to reinforce from Huilong Town, killing and capturing a total of more than 450 bandits.
　　Local armed forces in other areas have also achieved repeated victories. After recovering Shan County on the 3rd, the Taiyue Fifth Sub-district troops took advantage of the victory to recover Daying Town on the 4th, killing and capturing more than 330 enemies. In the Daqing River area of central Hebei, our local armed forces have annihilated more than 300 bandits of Wang Fenggang, Zhu Zhankui, and others in the Shengfang, Yongqing, and Ba County areas in the past half month. On the 9th and 10th, the local armed forces in central Shanxi twice repelled Yan bandit offensives in the Wenshui area, annihilating a total of 520 bandits. On the 4th, the local corps of the Northeast Andong Military Region captured Jiubingtai, an important stronghold of the Chiang bandits south of Fushun, annihilating most of the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the 207th Division, totaling 434 men.

专栏：一周战况

　　晋南扫清蒋阎匪军据点
  　鄂豫边区蒋匪即可肃清
    我华北野战军第一兵团一部，于十七日夜攻占晋南重镇临汾城，全歼守敌蒋匪整三十旅、阎匪六十六师及补训团保安团等共十三个团兵力。至此，蒋阎匪军在晋南的最后一个据点已被扫除，晋南完全获得解放。阎匪锡山十五日还给自己壮胆说：“城垣外围确保，守军实力强大，临汾战争绝不悲观。”但这话刚刚说完，临汾第二天就为我解放。
    中原解放军宛西强大攻势，自本月一日开始，至十日攻克邓县为止，胜利告一段落。是役共克内乡、淅川、镇平、邓县等四座县城，及西峡口、西坪镇、荆紫关、禹王店、李官桥、侯阳镇、重阳店等重镇七处，解放国土五万余方里。歼灭国民党匪军整九师七六旅之二二六团及四个保安团全部及十三个保安团大部共九千九百二十二人。宛属十三县为历来河南反动地主武装统治，宛西四县又为反动地主武装中之巢穴，国民党曾一再吹嘘其为封建军事统治之典范，白匪崇禧在伪国大报告军事时并向其鞠躬致敬。自我军进入豫陕鄂作战后，各地反动地主武装即遭我连续严重打击，今年一月十六日我第一次解放邓县时即歼灭其十一个保安团八千余人，经此次作战，蒋匪视为珍宝的“精锐团队”已残余无几，这对河南，特别是宛西人民的解放，有着极为深重的意义。目前我军正继续清剿残匪，鄂豫边区蒋匪不久即可全部肃清。
    十一日中原解放军又于平汉线再克遂平城，并于十四日夜第四次解放许昌城，全歼窜据该城不及一周由土蒋匪保一团等拼凑而成的独立第二十一旅三个团全部及伪河南省第五专署与许昌、襄城两县政府，生俘旅长兼专员范任等以下二千二百七十四名。我另部十三日亦再克荥阳城，全歼守敌暂编二六旅之第一团团部、直属队及两个整营，毙俘其六百八十余名。豫皖苏军区武装亦于四月十八日收复涡阳城，歼守敌八百余名。
    华东解放军山东兵团于解放昌、潍、安同时，复击败王匪耀武及丁匪治磐统率的由胶济路东西两端出犯增援的国民党军六个师十一个旅及两个保安团，并歼其四千七百六十三名。收复张店、周村等重镇，巩固了胶济中段的伟大胜利。
    华中军民已初步打垮蒋匪总体战，歼敌五千余名。苏中地方武装六日乘胜攻克启东之惠和镇，全歼守敌，并击溃由汇隆镇来援之匪交警两个大队，共毙俘匪四百五十余名。
    其他各地地武亦迭获胜利。太岳五分区部队三日收复陕县后复乘胜于四日收复大营镇，毙俘敌三百三十余人。冀中大清河北我地方武装，半个月来在胜芳、永清、霸县地区歼匪王凤岗、朱占魁等部三百余名。晋中地方武装九、十两日在文水地区两度击溃出犯阎匪，共歼匪五百二十名。东北安东军区地方兵团四日攻克抚顺南蒋匪重要据点救兵台，歼守敌二零七师二旅四团三营大部共四百三十四名。
