　　Chiang Kai-shek's Military Defeats Lead to Depleted Ranks
  　Continues to Force Students to Sacrifice Their Lives
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th】Due to Chiang Kai-shek's military defeats and depleted ranks, he has decided to continue forcing young students to sacrifice their lives for him. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 10th: The bandit Defense Ministry has ordered an extension of service terms by two years for four divisions of the bandit Youth Army and the Paratrooper Corps. The soldiers of the aforementioned two units are mostly young students, who were deceived and organized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits during the late stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the end of the war against Japan, some had already been discharged, while the rest continued to serve under the coercion of fascist secret agents. After our army liberated the headquarters of the completely disabled bandit Youth Army 206th Division and five regiments in Luoyang on March 13th, the soldiers of that division, under the care and education of our army, deeply regretted their past mistakes of serving the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' traitorous and dictatorial rule and opposing the people under fascist deception. More than 2,000 people joined the People's Liberation Army on April 10th to fight against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

　　蒋匪军事失利兵源枯竭
  　继续强迫学生卖命
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】蒋匪军事失利，兵源枯竭，决定继续强迫青年学生以生命供其牺牲。据美联社南京十日讯：匪国防部已下令匪青年军四个师及伞兵总队延长服役期限两年。按上述两种部队士兵，大部为青年学生，系在抗战后期被蒋匪诓骗组成。对日战争结束后，已有部分退伍，其余则在匪法西斯特务胁迫下继续服役。今年三月十三日，我军解放洛阳全残匪青年军二○六师师部及五个团后，该师士兵在我军爱护与教育下，深悔过去在法西斯欺骗下为蒋匪卖国独裁统治卖命与人民为敌的错误，已有二千余人于四月十日参加人民解放军讨伐蒋匪。
