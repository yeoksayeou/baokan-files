Newly Liberated Areas on Border Regions Should Pay Close Attention to Overcoming the Spring Famine

The cadres of Baian Village, Pingding East, actively took the initiative to divide the work and lead the masses to restore the sulfur kilns. The village gained 600 shi of millet, solving one-third of the village's grain shortage and enabling the spring plowing and production to proceed smoothly. This proves that as long as we actively engage in production for self-salvation, we can completely overcome the disasters caused by Chiang Kai-shek and natural disasters. However, some newly liberated areas on the border regions have not yet taken action. They do not recognize the severity of Chiang Kai-shek's disasters on the people, abandon leadership, deviate from the urgent demands of the masses to engage in land reform, and adopt a passive attitude toward production and disaster relief. They do not want to come up with specific solutions, and some only passively provide relief or issue grain loans without organizing the masses for production and self-salvation, causing some disaster victims to sit idle and consume their resources without organizing them for diligent production. Some border regions in the Taihang Second and Fifth Districts have this phenomenon. It is hoped that this will be quickly changed. Learn from the methods of Dongbaian, and discuss with the masses the ways of production and self-salvation based on the specific conditions and circumstances of each place. In this regard, many creations have been made in various places in Taihang. For example, Taiyuan, Yuci, Pingding, Shouyang, Xiyang and other counties organized large-scale transportation of about a thousand people each, transporting rice, iron, coal, military raw materials, etc., earning tens of thousands of catties of rice, which solved most of the difficulties of the disaster victims. Sixteen villages in the Eighth District of Xiyang boiled more than 70,000 catties of saltpeter, which also earned a lot of money. After grain loans were provided in the core areas, disaster victims were organized to spin, weave, reclaim wasteland, dig medicinal herbs, boil saltpeter, transport, and sell goods, which solved many problems. These methods are worth referring to in various places.

### 边沿区新区要十分注意克服春荒

　　边沿区新区要十分注意克服春荒
    平定东白岸村干主动分工领导群众恢复磺窑，全村获利达六百石小米，解决全村缺粮三分之一，使春耕生产得以顺利进行。证明只要我们积极起来生产自救，就完全可以战胜蒋灾和天灾。但是，也有某些边沿区至今尚未动手，不认识蒋灾对人民打击之重，放弃领导，脱离群众紧迫要求去搞土改，对生产救灾则抱消极态度，不想具体办法，有的只消极救济一下或发放贷粮贷款，不组织群众生产自救，使部分灾民坐吃山空，没有组织他们勤劳生产。太行二、五分区一些边沿区均有此种现象。希望迅速转变，学习东白岸的办法，根据各地具体情况条件，与群众共商生产自救之道，这方面，太行各地已有很多创造。如太谷、榆次、平定、寿阳、昔阳等县各组织千人左右的大运输，运输米、铁、煤、军工原料等，赚米各达数十万斤，解决了灾民大部困难。昔阳八区十六个村熬硝七万余斤，赚钱亦很多。腹心地区经过贷粮贷款，组织灾民纺织、垦荒、刨药、熬硝、运输、贩卖，均解决不少问题。这些办法都值得各地参考。
