(Taiyue News) According to the Qinshui County Party Committee's inspection of spring plowing work on April 30, the rectification of left-leaning deviations in Qinshui is being done very poorly. The chaotic situation in the Fifth District has not completely stopped, and some people are still infringing on the interests of the middle peasants, who are still offering land. The left-leaning deviations in Qinshui were originally very serious. For example, Huangduan Village in the Fifth District placed half of the village's population under control. Some places even recklessly engaged in "communism," implementing collective living and collective labor, causing panic among the middle peasants, who offered land and sheep. Some merchants even offered their shops. However, the County Party Committee did not adequately recognize the harmfulness of these left-leaning deviations, and the rectification was not resolute. Although they mentioned "serious" in their instructions to the districts on April 10, they did not prioritize the work of correcting deviations. After discussing the active development of the production movement, they lightly stated: "And focus on production to solve other production-related issues, such as isolating the poor and hired peasants, and excluding the middle peasants." There were no specific methods for correction. In addition, the left-leaning thoughts of the cadres were not thoroughly purged and criticized. Holding onto the idea that "left is better than right," when classifying classes, they would rather classify peasants as landlords and rich peasants than "dare to let go of a single landlord or rich peasant." They also said that the middle peasants were unreliable and must be treated differently, unwilling to return things to the middle peasants, and not allowing the middle peasants to speak. If a middle peasant said something unsatisfactory, it was said to be a "counterattack." In this way, they could not resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Bureau and thoroughly correct the left-leaning deviations. Therefore, after this inspection, which lasted for a dozen or twenty days, the Fifth District was still in a state of panic and unease. Some villages were still using new methods to control "struggle targets," called "systematic control," such as asking for leave when going out, reporting visitors, and registering property. In Lueerhui Village in the First District, they were still forcing middle peasants to provide free labor for the poor and hired peasants, so most of the middle peasants had the idea of "living one day at a time." Some said: "Wine and meat pass through the intestines, blessings sit in the heart," and they ate and drank heavily. Ren Changyou, a middle peasant in Zhongyu, said: "Isn't it all for others in the end?" In some places, middle peasants were still offering land, and some people were preparing to leave some land uncultivated. They said: "Don't blame us if it's left uncultivated." From the county as a whole, many infringements on the middle peasants have not been thoroughly corrected, and the control of landlords and rich peasants has not been lifted. Some said: if they must be lifted, only lift two or three days. Mutual aid groups oppose the participation of landlords and rich peasants, and even do not give them a way out to live... After this inspection, the Qinshui County Party Committee truly recognized the seriousness of the left-leaning deviations, determined the policy of implementing the Party's correct line, and thoroughly correcting the left-leaning deviations. They also pointed out that the main issue in left-leaning deviations is compensating the middle peasants, and landlords and rich peasants must also be given a way out to live.

    沁源纠偏做得很差
    至今还没取消管制
    【太岳消息】根据沁源县委四月三十日的春耕工作检查，说明沁源的纠正左倾偏向是作得很差的。五区的混乱局面到现在还没完全停止，还有人在继续侵犯中农利益，中农还在献地。沁源的左倾偏向本是很严重的，如五区黄段村就管制了全村一半户口，有些地方还胡乱搞“共产主义”，实行集体生活，集体劳动，闹得中农恐慌不安，献地献羊，还有些商人也献起店来。可是县委对这些左倾偏向的危害性是认识不够的，纠正是不坚决的。他们在四月十日给各区指示信上虽然说了“严重”，但并没把纠正偏向工作放在第一位。在谈了积极开展生产运动后，轻描淡写的说：“并以生产为主，去解决有关生产的其他问题，如孤立贫雇，排斥中农等”。更没有具体改正办法。加上干部左倾思想没有彻底清算批判，拿着“左”比右好的主意，划阶级时“宁把农民划到地主富农里去，不敢叫放过一个地主富农”，还说中农不可靠，须另眼看待，不愿给中农退东西，不许中农说话。如中农说句不满意的话，就说是“反攻”，这样就不能坚决执行中央局指示，彻底纠正左倾偏向。所以这回一检查，搞了一二十天，五区仍是人心惶惶不安，有些村还在用新方法管制“斗争对象”，叫做“制度管制”。如出门请假，来人报告，财产登记等。一区鹿耳回村，还在强迫中农给贫雇白劳动，所以中农多是“过一天算一天”的主意，有的说：“酒肉穿肠过，福在心中坐”，就大吃大喝。中峪中农任长有说：“闹好还不是给人家闹”。有些地方中农还在献地，有的人准备荒下一部分土地，他们说：“荒了也不要怪我们”。从全县来说，许多侵犯中农的事情还没有彻底纠正，对地主富农还没解除管制，有的说：若要解除只解除两三天，互助组里反对地主富农参加，更不给生活出路……。沁源县委经过这次检查后，真正认识了左倾的严重，确定了贯彻党的正确路线，彻底纠正左倾偏向的方针，并指出左倾中主要是补偿中农问题，对地主富农也要安置给他生活出路。
