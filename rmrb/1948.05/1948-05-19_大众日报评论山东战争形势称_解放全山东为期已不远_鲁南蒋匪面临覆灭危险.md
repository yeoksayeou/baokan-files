Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: *Dazhong Daily* recently published an editorial pointing out that the great victories of the Shandong Corps of the East China People's Liberation Army in the western and central sections of the Jiaoji Railway have completely connected the three strategic areas of Bohai, Jiaodong, and southern Shandong. The vast area, starting from Bohai in the north, reaching the north side of the Longhai Railway in the south, the Yimeng Mountains in the west, and the sea in the east, encompassing over 20 million people, is now free of the enemy except for Qingdao, Yantai, and Fushan, which are under the protection of American imperialism.

The editorial reviewed the situation over the past year and a half, stating that in January of last year, the Chiang bandits launched a "key offensive" against the Shandong Liberated Area with 600,000 troops, engaging in瘋狂烧杀淫掠(frantic burning, killing, raping, and looting) wherever their兽蹄(beastly hooves) reached, implementing a "destruction policy." However, under the powerful blows of our People's Liberation Army and the great struggle of the Shandong people in unanimously supporting the front, the Chiang bandits suffered losses of over 270,000 troops. In August, the East China Liberation Army organized the Western Front Corps, led by Generals Chen and Su, to launch an external counter-offensive, advancing into the Chiang-controlled areas and opening up a large new Liberated Area in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, providing strong support to the counter-offensive forces of Liu Deng and Chen Xie. The Eastern Front Corps persisted in internal operations, thwarting the Chiang bandits' plot to occupy and sell Jiaodong to American imperialism as a military base to enslave our Shandong people and invade our East China. The Battle of the Jiao River in October completely seized the initiative in the Shandong battlefield, the last defensive battlefield in the country's Liberated Areas, and similarly transitioned to a counter-offensive. After one or two months of new-style training through three checks and three rectifications, our Eastern Front Corps reorganized the Northern Jiangsu Corps, advanced into Northern Jiangsu, and achieved the great victory of Yilin. It also organized the Shandong Corps and launched a powerful spring offensive simultaneously with other battlefields across the country, sweeping the entire Jiaoji line and achieving a complete victory.

The editorial then analyzed the significant strategic importance and political impact of the liberation of Weifang, stating: First, the liberation of Weifang has further isolated Qingdao and Jinan, the two major strategic strongholds of the Chiang bandits in Shandong, and has broken the north-south barrier in our Shandong Liberated Area, connecting vast areas into one. This favorable situation is unprecedented. In the future, our army can more effectively concentrate and maneuver to annihilate the enemy, while the bandit troops in Jinpu, Longhai, and southern Shandong will be more passive and face the danger of annihilation. The complete annihilation of the Shandong Chiang bandits and the complete liberation of Shandong are not far off. Second, in the liberation campaign of Weifang, not only were the enemy's main forces annihilated, but also the reactionary local armed forces and puppet organizations of Zhang Tianzuo, Zhang Jingyue, and others were completely wiped out. This is a major event for the Shandong people, with significance even exceeding the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's main forces, because the puppet local armed forces led by Zhang Tianzuo and Zhang Jingyue have close ties with the local feudal reactionary forces and have inflicted extremely deep disasters on the Shandong people during their long period of criminal rule. The recovery of Weixian and its vast areas will liberate the vast number of people from the suffering of the Chiang disaster and ignite the flames of revenge to participate in the great struggle to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Third, Weifang's return to the hands of the people will greatly benefit the construction work of the Shandong Liberated Area. Weifang and other cities will become important economic bases for our Shandong battlefield to support the war. From now on, the rear of the Shandong Liberated Area will be more consolidated, and the Shandong military and civilians will be more favorably able to complete the glorious task of annihilating the enemy and recovering all lost territories.

The editorial concluded by saying: We have achieved great victories, but the enemies in Shandong have not been completely annihilated, especially in our Central China region, where there are even more enemies. The rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang throughout the country has not been finally overthrown. Therefore, we cannot relax for a moment and must bravely advance, intensifying production and construction on the one hand, and intensifying the annihilation of the enemy on the other, supporting Central China and cooperating with fraternal corps of liberation armies across the country to thoroughly overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, and strive for the complete victory of liberating all of China.

　　大众日报评论山东战争形势称
    解放全山东为期已不远
    鲁南蒋匪面临覆灭危险
    【新华社华东十六日电】此间大众日报顷发表社论，指出华东人民解放军山东兵团在胶济西段与胶济中段两个战役的伟大胜利，使渤海、胶东、大鲁南三个战略地区已完全连成一片，北起渤海、南迄陇海路北侧、西从沂蒙山区、东抵于海，包括两千余万人口的广大地区，除在美帝国主义庇护下的青岛及烟台、福山以外，已无敌踪。社论历述一年半以来之形势称：去年一月蒋贼以六十万兵力“重点进攻”山东解放区，兽蹄所至，疯狂烧杀淫掠，实施“毁灭政策”，但在我强大解放军歼灭打击与山东人民一致支援前线的伟大斗争下，蒋贼先后损兵折将达二十七万余人。八月间华东解放军组织西线兵团，由陈粟将军统率，转入外线反攻，挺进蒋区，开辟了苏鲁豫皖大块新解放区，对刘邓、陈谢两路反攻大军作了有力配合。东线兵团则坚持内线作战，粉碎了蒋贼企图占领并出卖胶东给美帝国主义作奴役我山东人民及侵略我华东的军事基地的阴谋。十月胶河一战，使全国解放区最后一个防御的战场——山东战场已完全夺得主动权，并同样转入反攻。及经一、二两个月三查三整的新式练兵后，我东线兵团复组织苏北兵团，挺进苏北，取得益林大捷，并组织山东兵团，与全国各战场同时发动强大春季攻势，扫荡胶济全线，取得了全胜。
    社论继分析潍坊解放之重大战略意义与政治影响称：第一、维坊的解放，使蒋匪在山东的两个主要战略据点青岛和济南更加孤立，使我山东解放区打破了南北阻隔，广大地区连成一片，这个有利形势是过去任何时期所不及的，今后我军可以更加集中机动歼灭敌人；而在津浦、陇海及鲁南的匪军，则更加陷于被动与面临覆灭的危险。全部歼灭山东蒋匪及全部解放山东已经为期不远了。第二、在潍坊的解放战役中，不但歼灭了敌人的主力，同时全歼了张天佐、张景月等部反动地方武装和伪组织，这对于山东人民来说是一件大事，其意义甚至超过了蒋介石主力的被歼，因为以张天佐、张景月为首的伪地方武装，和当地封建反动势力有着密切联系，在长期罪恶统治期间给予山东人民的灾难是十分深重的。潍县及其广大地区的光复，将使广大人民从痛苦的蒋灾中解放出来，燃起复仇的怒火，来参加全部消灭蒋介石匪帮的伟大斗争。第三、潍坊回到了人民的手中将大大有利于山东解放区的建设工作，潍坊等城市将成为我山东战场支援战争的重要经济基地。从此山东解放区的后方更加巩固了，山东军民将更有利的来完成歼灭敌人与收复一切失地的光荣任务。
    社论最后称：我们已经取得了伟大胜利，但是，山东境内的敌人尚未完全歼灭，特别是我华中地区还有更多的敌人，全国蒋介石匪帮统治尚未最后被打倒，因此我们一刻也不能松懈，必须勇敢前进，一面加紧生产建设，一面加紧歼敌，支援华中并配合全国各解放军兄弟兵团，为彻底打倒蒋介石、消灭蒋介石反动集团及为解放全中国的彻底胜利而奋斗。
