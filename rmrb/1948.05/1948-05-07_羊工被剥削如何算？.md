　　How to Calculate Exploitation of Shepherd Workers?
Editor：
    I have encountered two questions in class designation and hope to get answers:
    1. Are small lambs counted as income? How is the exploitation of shepherd workers calculated? Here, we count the lambs as the shepherd worker's labor income, and then deduct the feed provided by the owner, etc., the remainder is the amount of exploitation of the shepherd worker.
    2. How should elementary school teachers be considered as laborers and how should their family be classified? Qie Deming himself works as an elementary school teacher outside. His family owns 25 mu of land and employs one person. His father is at home but is old and can only do some light work. There are five people in his family, half a head of cattle, and half a building. If he is not considered as a laborer, his family would be a rich peasant; if he is considered a laborer, he would be a well-to-do middle peasant. His family's 25 mu of land yields 25 shi of grain, and his father can contribute a quarter of the labor. Besides his own expenses, he can earn 9 shi of grain. There is no other exploitation in his family. Please advise on how to calculate.
    3. When calculating for elementary school teachers and cadres, the masses discussed: If they were laborers at home before they left, their labor should be counted with the family; if they were not laborers when they left, their labor should not be counted with the family. Is this correct?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Comrades of the Wuxiang Joint Office and Wuxiang Office:
    1. The question of whether small lambs should be counted as income is not clear, and the working conditions of shepherd workers vary from place to place, making it impossible to answer. Generally speaking, the calculation of the exploited part of shepherd workers should deduct the owner's capital, equipment, feed, wages, burden… etc., and the net income is the exploited part.
    2. Revolutionary cadres who work outside and hire people to cultivate or rent out land because they are unable to cultivate themselves to maintain their livelihoods should not be considered as exploitation. Elementary school teachers who hire workers because there is no other labor in the family, and whose family life does not exceed that of a general middle peasant, should also not be classified as landlords or rich peasants. Elementary school teachers and revolutionary cadres, whether they were laborers or not when they left home, should now be considered as laborers because they are now serving the people and are mental laborers.

### 羊工被剥削如何算？

　　羊工被剥削如何算？编辑同志：
    在划阶级中遇着两个问题希解答一下：
    １、小羊羔是否算收入？羊工被剥削又如何算？我们在这里，把羊羔算为羊工的劳动收入，然后除去他主家喂的料等外，即是羊工被剥削数。
    ２、小学教员顶劳动者，与家庭又如何算？郄德明他本人在外当小学教员，家中有地廿五亩，用的一个人，他父在家但年老，只能做些轻活，他家中有五口人，半头牛，楼院半所。如不给他顶劳力，他家中就是个富农；如给他顶劳力，就是个富裕中农。他家中廿五亩地打廿五石粮，他父能顶四分之一劳动力，他在外除吃，能赚谷九石。家中其他剥削没有，希告知如何算？
    ３、小学教员、干部算时群众讨论：如他在家是劳力走了的，即与家庭算劳力，如走时不是劳动者，即不与家中算劳力。是否对？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　武乡联合办公室武乡办公室同志：
    一、小羊羔是否算收入这个问题提的不清楚，且各地羊工的劳动条件不同，无法来答。一般的说，羊工被剥削部分的计算，应除去主家的资本、设备、饲料、工资、负担………等，其纯收入即为被剥削部分。
    二、革命干部，自己在外工作，因无力耕种而雇人耕种或出租土地，赖以维持生活者，不得认为是剥削行为。小学教员因家中另外无劳力而雇工，家中生活不超过一般中农者，也不应定为地主或富农成份。小学教员及革命干部不论离家时是劳动者或不是劳动者，现在均应认为是劳动者，因为他们现在是在为人民服务，是脑力劳动者。
