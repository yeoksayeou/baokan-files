Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army Front Headquarters has announced the operational progress and comprehensive results of the second stage of the Spring Offensive (April 17th to May 17th). Following the victory at Yichuan, the second stage of the Spring Offensive included the attack on the Jing and Wei River areas to liberate Yan'an and Luochuan, pursuing fleeing enemies, and crushing the counterattacks of Hu Zongnan and Ma Bufang's bandit troops in the western section of the Longhai Railway and the Longnan area. From April 17th to May 17th, spanning a month, there were over 40 battles, large and small, annihilating nearly 20,000 of Hu and Ma's bandit troops, and capturing and recovering 12 county towns.

　　In early April, our army used a portion of its forces to continue to besiege Yan'an and Luochuan, inducing Hu Zongnan's bandit troops to transfer nine brigades from western Henan and southeastern Shaanxi to reinforce the north. As a result, Hu's bandit deployment was disrupted, and the rear became empty. On the morning of April 17th, our main force launched a thunderous attack on the Chiang-occupied areas north and south of the Jing River, destroying Hu's hundreds-of-li deep blockade line in the Northwest, which had been constructed over eight years. With a blitz-like posture, they crossed the banks of the Jing and Wei Rivers, and within ten days, successively captured 12 county towns including Chunyi, Yongshou, Binxian, Lin Mao, Changwu, Fufeng, Fengxiang, Qishan, Baoji, Weiyang in Shaanxi, and Lingtai, Chongxin in Gansu, as well as important towns and stations such as Zhida, Zhanghong, Yongle, Shidian, Changning, Guozhen, and Caijiapo. This cut off hundreds of li of the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, the Xi'an-Xining Highway, and the western section of the Longhai Railway, and sealed off the bandit nest of Xi'an from land connections with Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Suffering this heavy blow, Hu's bandit troops had to urgently order their troops reinforcing Luochuan in the north to retreat. The Hu bandit troops isolated in the northern line of Yan'an and Luochuan, despairing of reinforcements and fearing annihilation, abandoned the cities and fled south in a panic on April 21st and 25th. Our besieging troops pursued them fiercely, and from April 22nd to 28th, successively inflicted heavy blows on the enemy south of Binxian and in the Wuzhuang area between Luochuan and Baishui. At this time, our western front army also captured Baoji City, an important strategic stronghold for military and economic purposes in the Northwest. After completing the task of destroying Hu's important supply base in the Northwest, they took the initiative to withdraw from Baoji, return north, and shift their spearhead directly to Pingliang and Jingchuan. Having suffered successive heavy blows, Hu's bandit troops poured in all their resources in the Northwest in an attempt to make a desperate gamble, gathering the 82nd Reorganized Division (two brigades, including five cavalry regiments and four infantry regiments), the 36th Reorganized Division (three brigades, nine regiments), the 65th Reorganized Division (two brigades, six regiments), the 38th Reorganized Division (three brigades, nine regiments), the 1st Reorganized Division (three brigades, nine regiments), the 203rd Youth Army Division (two brigades, six regiments, one of which had officers but no soldiers), the 27th Brigade of the 30th Reorganized Division, the 89th Regiment of the 30th Brigade, and the 4th Cavalry Brigade, totaling seven reorganized divisions and seventeen brigades, attempting to "encircle and annihilate" our army in the Pingliang area of eastern Gansu. However, under our army's flexible and mobile strikes, the enemy's plan was completely shattered, and we annihilated over 3,500 enemy troops in ten days.

　　The comprehensive and brilliant results of the second stage of our army's Spring Offensive are as follows:

　　A. The annihilation of the headquarters of the 76th Reorganized Division of the enemy's regular army (including the special service battalion, communications battalion, and engineer battalion), the entire New 40th Regiment of the 144th Reorganized Brigade, a part of the New 41st Regiment, the entire 3rd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 203rd Youth Army Division, all officers of the 6th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade, one company of the search battalion; the entire 182nd Regiment and artillery battalion of the 61st Reorganized Brigade, the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the 2nd Provisional Brigade, a part of the 17th Brigade of the 38th Reorganized Division, and the defeat of the headquarters of the 17th Reorganized Division, the 12th Brigade, and the 48th Brigade; the 82nd Reorganized Division, the 36th Reorganized Division, and the 65th Reorganized Division also suffered significant casualties.

　　B. The annihilation of the entire Shaanxi Security 19th Regiment, Shaanxi Security 21st Regiment, and the reactionary landlord armed forces of Chunyi, Binxian, Yongshou, and Linmao, and a part of the local Chiang Kai-shek forces in Fufeng, Fengxiang, Changwu, and other counties.

Capturing 5,491 enemy regular army personnel, including Xu Bao, commander of the 76th Reorganized Division (mortally wounded), Lei Xiadian (escaped after capture), major general and regimental commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 203rd Division, Wu Shigang, deputy regimental commander, and Ren Fenghuan, director of the political work office.
