　　Workers and Peasants Bravely Resist Oppression and Hunger
　　Indian Workers Rise Up in Strikes
　　Peasants Use Shovels and Bamboo Poles as Weapons to Seize Land
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Delhi dispatch: TASS reported on the 20th that the struggle of Indian workers and peasants against oppression and hunger "is rising higher and higher." The strike of textile workers in Nagpur, Central Province, has shut down four textile factories. The strikers are demanding wage increases and the release of arrested labor leaders. Railway workers in South India have been on strike for some time to protest the railway authorities' refusal to increase wages and improve working conditions. Nine thousand short-term workers on the "Great Indian Peninsula Railway" are also on strike, expressing anger at receiving lower wages than ordinary workers. The strike committee has also passed a resolution protesting the railway management's mistreatment and intimidation. The Calcutta Civil Servants' Trade Union Federation recently filed a protest against the authorities' retaliatory persecution of civil servants who participated in the April strike. At the same time, the peasant movement resisting high rents is also developing. Four hundred agricultural workers and peasants in Gorakhpur used shovels and bamboo poles as weapons to oppose landlords and seize large amounts of their land. In several regions of Bombay Province, including Malabar, Pune, Satara, Belgaum, and several areas of the Hyderabad State, peasant resistance struggles have been violently suppressed by the military police and landlords.
    Another dispatch: The Indian authorities' reactionary measures to persecute the Communist Party of India (CPI) and democratic figures continue to this day. In Hyderabad, twenty CPI members were brutally murdered. A special prison has been established in Mennagore on the Malabar Coast specifically to imprison CPI members, with over 150 people being mistreated in the prison. In Cuttack and other places in Orissa, police have searched the addresses of the CPI and railway trade unions, and many people have been arrested. Six CPI members in Zambur Prison in Central Province have launched a hunger strike to protest the authorities' extension of their imprisonment for six months without trial and various abuses. At the same time, the Indian authorities have released large numbers of reactionaries from the military fascist organization "Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh" (RSS). In Punjab alone, 1,042 were released, and 55 in Madras, all of whom were arrested in connection with the assassination of Gandhi.

    农民以铲子竹杠为武器夺取土地
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】德里讯：塔斯社二十日电称：印度工农反压迫反饥饿的斗争“正愈益高涨”。中央省那格不尔纺织业工人的罢工，已使四个纺织厂停工。罢工者要求增资及释放被捕之劳工领袖。南印铁路工人为抗议铁道当局坚拒增资与改善劳动条件的要求，已罢工若干时日。“大印度半岛铁路”九千名短工亦进行罢工，他们对所得工资低于普通工人表示愤怒。罢工委员会并曾通过决议，抗议铁道管理当局之酷待和恫吓。加尔各答公务员工会联合会因当局对参加四月间罢工的公务员采取报复迫害措施，亦于日前提出抗议。同时，抗拒高额租税的农民运动亦在发展。哥拉克浦四百名农业工人及农民，曾以铲子竹杠为武器，反对地主并夺取其大量土地。在孟买省境之马拉巴、浦那、沙塔拉、贝尔加姆以及海德拉巴土邦之若干地区，农民的反抗斗争，曾横遭军警及地主的暴力镇压。
    另讯：印度当局迫害印共及民主人士的反动措施，迄今仍继续不已。在海德拉巴有二十名印共党员惨遭杀害。马拉巴海岸的孟那哥尔并设有专门监禁印共党员的特别监狱，在该狱遭受虐待者达一百五十名以上。在奥里萨之卡塔克等地，警察曾搜查印共及铁路工会地址，许多人被捕。中央省赞布尔监狱的六名印共党员已发动绝食斗争，抗议当局未经审讯即延长监禁期六个月以及种种虐待行为。与此同时，印度当局却大批释放了军事法西斯组织“拉斯第亚、沙瓦克、尚”的反动分子，仅在旁遮普释放者即达一千零四十二名，在马德拉斯五十五名，他们均系与暗杀甘地有关而被捕者。
