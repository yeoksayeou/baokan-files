　　Local Armed Forces of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Achieve Victory in Offensive
  　Continuously Eliminating More Than 200 Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    Political Offensive in Dongping and Other Places Wins Over 500 Enemy and Puppet Troops to Return
    [Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 14th] Our local armed forces have been actively launching offensives and continuously winning victories in eliminating small groups of enemies. On the night of May 7th, a unit of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region's armed forces besieged the Changgou stronghold, 35 li northwest of Jining. Stationed there were the 3rd and 4th squadrons of Chiang Kai-shek bandits from Jining County and the Township Office, totaling more than 200 men. The attack was launched at 12:00 AM, and after three hours of combat, they broke into the stronghold, completely annihilating the defending enemy. Thirty-two enemies were killed or wounded, 175 enemies were captured, and 131 rifles, 5 grenade launchers, 9 light machine guns, over 13,000 rounds of ammunition, a telephone, and other military supplies were seized. On the morning of the 8th, more than 500 enemy troops from Jining attempted to invade but were defeated and fled back. On April 29th, the Caoxian Brigade of our Fifth Military Sub-district engaged a battalion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Fifth Division in Longlou and Wanlou, killing or wounding more than 50 enemy soldiers, capturing 20 prisoners, and seizing 1 heavy machine gun, 2 submachine guns, and 20 rifles. On May 2nd, our Pingyin Brigade annihilated the Hongpan Township Office of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Dong'e, capturing 10 enemies and seizing 32 rifles and other military supplies. On the 8th, our Changqing Brigade raided the puppet Third District Township Office and the Home-Returning Corps, capturing 30 enemies and obtaining one small cannon, 24 rifles, 7 pistols, and a telephone. We suffered no casualties.
    [Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 15th] Since Dongping County launched its political offensive, due to the correct implementation of policies towards personnel of the Home-Returning Corps and puppet organizations, more than 300 personnel from the Home-Returning Corps and puppet organizations in the First, Third, Sixth, and Seventh Districts have successively fled. Some have come over from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit strongholds in Wenshang and other places, some carrying weapons. After returning, they confessed to our democratic government, admitted their mistakes to the masses, and resolved to be good people at home. On April 6th, district and village cadres held a meeting to discuss the spirit of the policy towards the Home-Returning Corps. The next day, an old woman from Huatang Village, after hearing about it, immediately consulted with the village cadres and then personally went to the Home-Returning Corps in Lishangcheng to persuade her son, Hu Yanfen, to turn back. Hu Yanfen, upon hearing about the lenient policy of our democratic government, immediately took a rifle and seven rows of bullets that evening and defected to the liberated area.
    [Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 15th] A political offensive briefing from the First District Committee stated: According to reports from the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Districts of Taixi County and the District Committee's inspection of the First District of Pingyin and the Seventh District of Feicheng, a total of 259 puppet soldiers and puppet organization personnel have been won over during this political offensive, including 113 landlords and rich peasants, 99 middle peasants, and 47 poor peasants. They also surrendered 33 rifles, 8 pistols, and over 500 rounds of ammunition. These people have begun to recognize the lenient policy of our Party. Under this influence, the enemy's interior is very chaotic, and the masses have expressed satisfaction, creating favorable conditions for continuing to disintegrate the enemy in the future.

　　冀鲁豫地方武装出击获胜
  　连续歼灭蒋匪二百多
    东平等地政攻争取敌伪五百来归
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】我地方武装积极出击歼灭小股敌人连绩获胜。五月七日夜，我冀鲁豫军区武装一部，围攻济宁西北三十五里长沟据点。内驻蒋匪济宁县三、四两个中队及乡公所共二百余人，十二时发起攻击，经三小时战斗攻入砦内，全歼守敌，毙伤敌三十二人，俘敌一百七十五人，缴获步枪一百三十一支，掷弹筒五个，轻机枪九挺，子弹一万三千余发，电话机一部，其他军用品一部。八日上午济宁敌五百余出犯被我击溃窜回。四月二十九日，我五分区曹县大队在龙楼、万楼和蒋匪五师一个营作战，毙伤敌五十多人，俘虏二十人，缴获重机枪一挺，冲锋枪二挺，步枪二十支。五月二日我平阴大队将东阿蒋匪红畔乡公所消灭，俘敌十人，缴获步枪三十二支，其他军用品一部。八日我长清大队奔袭伪三区乡公所及还乡团，俘敌三十人，得小炮一门，步枪二十四支，短枪七支，电话机一部，我无伤亡。
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】东平县自开展政治攻势以来，由于正确执行对还乡团伪组织人员的政策，现一、三、六、七等区已有三百余还乡团和伪组织人员相继逃出。汶上等蒋匪据点来归并有的携带武器者，回来后向我民主政府悔过，向群众承认错误，决心回家做个好人。四月六日区村干开会讨论了对还乡团的政策精神，第二天华堂村一个老太太听说后，马上找村干商量，接着亲自跑到理上城还乡团内，劝说儿子胡衍芬回头。胡衍芬听说我民主政府的宽大政策，当晚即携带一支步枪，七排子弹投奔解放区。
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】一地委政治攻势简报内称：根据太西县三、四、七区的汇报和地委对平阴一区、肥城七区的检查，这段政治攻势中共已争取伪军伪组织人员来归者二百五十九人，内中地富一百一十三人，中农九十九人，贫农四十七人，并献出步马枪三十三支，短枪八支，子弹五百多发。这些人开始认识了我党的宽大政策，在此影响下，敌人内部非常混乱，群众表示满意，给今后继续瓦解敌人造下有利条件。
