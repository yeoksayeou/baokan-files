　　Our Party's Industrial and Commercial Policies Expand Influence
　　Handan Medicinal Herb Conference Is Very Lively
　　Merchants from Shanghai, Hankou, and Other Places Come to Participate
　　[Handan News] In order to facilitate the exchange of Sichuan-Guangdong and Northeast (关外) medicinal materials and the mutual exchange of mountain and plain medicinal materials, this city has initiated a medicinal herb conference. A preparatory committee composed of the medicinal herb industry was formed, stipulating that the conference will be held twice a year. The spring session will be from the 15th day of the third lunar month to the 15th day of the fourth lunar month, with the main session from the 1st to the 5th day of the fourth lunar month. Before the main session, there were more than 100 merchants from Anguo, Yuzhou, Jincheng, Baodian, Xiyang, Changzhi, and other places, and 96 merchants from Xinxiang, Shanghai, Hankou, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Anyang, and other places in the Chiang-controlled areas. Guests were provided with special personnel in each shop, and food and lodging were convenient and priced fairly. They brought Anemarrhena asphodeloides, Codonopsis pilosula from the mountains, chrysanthemum, Achyranthes bidentata, Dioscorea opposita thunb from Huaiqing Prefecture, and more than 20 kinds of Northeast goods such as Saposhnikovia divaricata, Paeonia obovata from Anguo, and 60 kinds of Sichuan-Guangdong medicinal materials such as cinnabar and realgar from Shanghai, Hankou, and Anyang. The total amount of various medicinal materials was more than 162,000 catties. The most valuable medicinal material, such as cinnabar, was 130,000 yuan per catty, Amomum villosum and Aucklandia lappa were 80,000 yuan per catty, and the average price of various medicinal materials was 1,500 yuan per catty. The total transaction value in five days was more than 20 million yuan, an increase of more than five times compared to the transaction volume before the main session. The medicinal materials brought by the guests were completely sold out, half of which were sold to various shops and firms in the city, and half were sold to Anguo area in central Hebei. Some Anguo guests arrived late and could not buy goods. The mountain goods sold in large quantities were Anemarrhena asphodeloides and silk floss. Rheum palmatum and Angelica sinensis, which were most lacking in the past, arrived in large quantities this time.

　　In addition to large-scale transactions in various firms, a market was also organized to facilitate the retail trade of small vendors. Colorful buildings were erected at both ends of the market, and the venue was covered with mat sheds, which were filled with congratulatory banners sent by medicinal herb merchants from all over the country. More than 300 kinds of medicinal materials were displayed under the sheds. The conference also set up a special reception office to receive merchants. In order to make the conference more lively, the Xinsheng Troupe and the Magic Troupe performed free of charge during the conference, and a circus also participated. From morning to night, the guests and audience were very crowded. Small vendors from the surrounding villages and small merchants from Huangdi and other places within 200 li also pushed carts and carried medicinal materials on their shoulders to attend the fair. In order to take care of the difficulties of small vendors from afar, the preparatory committee decided to purchase the goods brought by the vendors every afternoon at market prices, subject to their voluntary agreement. On the third day of the conference, the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the preparatory committee held a symposium for medicinal herb merchants. At the meeting, Mayor Yuan explained the government's firm policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce and import and export policies. Some merchants from the Chiang-controlled areas, because they were not clear about the industrial and commercial policies of the Liberated Areas in the past and were influenced by Chiang bandit propaganda, did not dare to come to the Liberated Areas to do business. After this personal experience, they generally felt that doing business in the Liberated Areas was much freer than in the Chiang-controlled areas. They expressed their strong resentment for the extortion and banditry of the Chiang-controlled areas, where one could not move without money, and expressed their willingness to publicize the policies of the Liberated Areas in the Chiang-controlled areas in the future, expose Chiang bandit's various slanders against the Liberated Areas, and invite more industrialists and merchants to operate in the Liberated Areas.　　　　(Yuan Yin)

　　我党工商业政策影响扩大
  　邯郸药材大会十分热闹
  　上海、汉口等地药商均前来参加
    【邯郸消息】为了便利川广及关外药材交换和山地平原药材互易有无，本市特发起药材大会。由药材业组成筹委会，规定每年会期二次。春季会期由阴历三月十五日起至四月十五日止，正会期是四月初一至初五。正会期前，由安国、禹州、晋城、鲍店、昔阳、长治等地来的商人有百余人，从蒋占区新乡、上海、汉口、郑州、济南、安阳等地来的商人有九十六人。来客招待，各栈设有专人，食宿方便，取价公平。他们带来了山地的知母、党参、怀庆府的菊花、牛夕、山药，从安国带来了黄风、赤芍等关外货二十余种，从上海、汉口、安阳等地带来朱砂、雄黄等川广药材六十余种。共计各种药材十六万二千余斤。最贵重的药材如朱砂十三万元一斤，砂仁与广木香每斤八万元，各种药材平均价每斤一千五百元，五天内交易总值约两万万元以上，比正会期前交易额增五倍以上。来客药材完全出售，其中一半销售于本市各栈行，一半销售于冀中安国一带。有一大些安国客人因来迟，买不上货。山地山货出售的大批是知母和黄丝，过去最感缺乏的大黄、当归，这次大批到来。
    药材交易除大批在各行栈进行外，为便利小商贩零星药材交易，又另外组织了市场。市场两端高搭彩楼，会场满搭席棚，并挂满了各地药材商送给大会的贺帐。棚下陈列了三百余种药材。大会并专设招待处招待客商。为使会场更加热闹，会期中由新生剧团魔术团义务出演，并有马戏班参加。每日从早到晚来客与观众非常拥挤。四乡小贩和远及二百余里之内黄等地的小商，也推车肩挑药材前来赶会。筹委会为照顾远地小贩困难，决定每天下午将小贩来货征求其自愿，按市价收买。大会第三天，商联会和筹委会召开了药材商座谈会。会上由袁市长阐明政府坚决保护与发展工商业政策和出入口政策。有些从蒋占区来的商人，因为过去不清楚解放区工商政策，并受到蒋匪宣传，不敢来解放区经商，经过这次亲身体验，普遍觉得解放区做生意比蒋占区自由得多。他们表示对蒋占区敲诈勒索、无钱不能走路的土匪作风十分痛恨，并愿意以后到蒋占区宣传解放区政策。揭破蒋匪对解放区各种污蔑，邀请更多的工商业者来解放区经营。　　　　（元音）
