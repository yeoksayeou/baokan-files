    Advancing Towards the Liberation of the Entire Northeast
    Northeast Military Region Field Army Holds Staff Conference
    Strengthening the Combat Power and Organization of Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th] The Northeast Military Region Field Army staff conference, of great significance for completing the annihilation of the Chiang bandits in the Northeast and liberating the entire Northeast, successfully concluded on April 16th after 22 days. More than 400 staff comrades participating in the conference conducted discussions in separate departments, presented key reports, exchanged experiences, summarized their work over the past year, and proposed guidelines for the construction and development of staff work in the future, enabling everyone to establish new perspectives on staff work ideologically. In addition, in order to improve organization, rectify work style, and enhance work, many specific methods and systems were studied, providing new plans for army building, education, and combat organization in the coming period. At the meeting, Commander Lin Biao analyzed the changes in the national and Northeast war situations in his report, proposing that under the new situation, our Party and army in the Northeast should make timely changes in ideology, organizational form, working methods, and systems. He particularly emphasized that the staff work should be transformed and strengthened first in the military institutions, and the headquarters must become a command organ with scientific thinking and organizational capabilities. If we do not attach importance to the construction of staff work with new perspectives now, we will make mistakes. Deputy Political Commissar Luo Ronghuan, in his report on the future army building in the Northeast, emphasized that in order to better adapt to the changing war situation, the troops need to be more concentrated and unified, abide by the system, and strengthen discipline, and explained the importance of staff work in large-scale operations. Chief of Staff Liu Yalou summarized the staff work of the past year, pointing out that the staff work has been greatly improved over the past year, basically guaranteeing the completion of the army's operations, army building, training and other tasks. In terms of operations, staff officers have stepped out of the office and are active in command posts, observation posts, and assault troops, organizing and ensuring the realization of commanders' decisions. At the same time, they regularly summarize combat experience, plan and implement troop replenishment, reorganize equipment, and adjust personnel, so that our army can not only fight mobile warfare with American-equipped enemies in terms of combat command and organization, but also learn to break through the enemy's modern fortifications in siege warfare. In terms of training, a lot of work has also been done to implement Commander Lin's tactical thinking and combat style, thus laying the foundation for the tactical thinking and unified system of our army in the Northeast. In terms of army building, the headquarters of various military regions have built and trained a large number of second-line corps, ensuring the expansion and unprecedented manning of the field army's main force. Secondly, the headquarters' own professional work has also improved, mainly reflected in the fact that the organization has been more substantial than in the past, the cadres have been strengthened, the work of various departments of the headquarters has also explored a set of methods, established some systems and mutual assistance work styles, and there have been many improvements in working methods, such as being able to work without setting up stalls in the combat environment, and being able to often help troops in combat and training. Therefore, the prestige of the headquarters is increasing day by day. The troops feel that the staff officers have helped and urged them, and the leaders also feel that there is a relatively strong headquarters. Chief of Staff Liu also pointed out that today our staff work is still far behind the development of the objective situation. First of all, our staff officers have not thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's ten military principles and Commander Lin's tactical thinking and war style, and many deviations have occurred in the implementation of certain troops. The staff officers themselves are also quite poor in this regard. Secondly, it is not enough to ensure that leaders can make well-founded decisions and ensure the realization of leaders' decisions organizationally; the management of troops is not done well enough, the phenomenon of attrition still exists, and the proportion of non-combat personnel in the troop establishment is still very large; there is still a lack of organization, regularity, and perfunctoriness in work style and methods. The reasons for these shortcomings are, first of all, there are deviations in the view of staff work. Staff officers are not satisfied with their own work, and some commanders are not good at using the headquarters organs due to guerrilla habits and handicraft work methods, so they do not pay enough attention to staff work, and the leadership and assistance are very poor, so that the work of the headquarters at all levels is divorced from the work of the commanders at all levels, forming a so-called "two lines" phenomenon, rather than the leaders commanding the troops well through the headquarters. Secondly, the general cultural level of staff officers is not high, and their military knowledge and cultivation cannot keep up with the needs of the work. In order to overcome the above shortcomings and strengthen the staff work in the future, Chief of Staff Liu put forward four directions of effort: (1) Staff officers should pay attention to their own work and realize that the quality of staff work directly affects the combat and operational effectiveness. In modern warfare, it is impossible to smoothly command the army without strong staff work. (2) The chiefs of staff at all levels should become the direct hosts and organizers of the headquarters work. (3) Eliminate the "two lines" phenomenon, so that the command and organization and the guarantee of command work are correctly combined, so that the leaders become the persons in charge of leading the headquarters, and the chiefs of staff become the persons in charge of directly organizing the headquarters work. (4) Advocate the organizational, rapid, accurate, strict, and hard-working staff work style. Finally, Chief of Staff Liu called on all staff officers to actively study military politics, especially to be proficient in staff work, so as to promote and ensure the continuous progress of staff work.

    向解放全东北前进
    东北军区野战军开参谋会议
    加强部队战斗力量和组织性
    【新华社东北十日电】对完成全歼东北蒋匪与解放全东北具有重大意义的东北军区野战军参谋会议，历时二十二日后，已于四月十六日胜利闭幕。参加大会的四百余参谋工作同志，曾按部门分别进行讨论，并有重点的进行汇报，交流经验，分别作出一年来的总结，提出了今后参谋工作建设与发展的方针，使大家在思想上树立了对参谋工作的新观点。此外，为健全组织，改进作风，提高工作，又研究出许多具体办法与制度，为今后一个时期的建军、教育和组织战斗等工作，提供了新的方案。会上林彪司令员在报告中分析了全国及东北战争形势的转变，提出在新的形势下东北我党我军在思想上，组织形式上，工作方式上和制度上都应及时有所转变，并特别强调在军事机构中首先应转变参谋工作，加强参谋工作，必须使司令部成为有科学头脑，有组织能力的指挥机关，如果目前我们再不以新的观点来重视参谋工作的建设，我们就将会犯错误。罗荣桓副政委报告今后东北建军问题时着重指出，为了更加适合战争形势的转变，部队需要更加集中统一，遵守制度，加强纪律，并说明参谋工作在大规模作战中的重要性。刘亚楼参谋长总结了一年来参谋工作，指出一年来参谋工作已大大提高一步，基本上保证了全军作战、建军、练兵等任务的完成。在作战方面参谋人员已从室内走出而活跃于指挥所，观察所，及突击部队内，组织与保证指挥员决心的实现，同时经常总结作战经验，计划及实施部队的补充，整理了装备和调整了人员，使我军在作战指挥与组织上不仅能和美械敌人作运动战，并且学会突破敌人现代化防御工事的攻坚战。在练兵方面对贯彻林司令员的战术思想与战斗作风也进行了很多工作，因而奠定了东北我军的战术思想的基础和统一制度的基础。在建军方面各军区司令部建设和训练大批的第二线兵团，保证了野战军主力的扩大与空前满员。其次是司令部本身的业务工作也提高了，主要表现在组织上已较过去充实，干部加强了，司令部各部门工作也摸索到一套办法，建立了一些制度和互助的工作作风，工作方式也有不少的改进，如在战斗环境中不等摆开摊子也可以工作了，并且能够常常帮助部队作战和练兵，因此司令部的工作威信日益提高，部队感觉参谋人员对他们有了帮助和督促，首长也觉得有一个比较强的司令部。刘参谋长又指出，今天我们的参谋工作还远落后于客观形势的发展，首先是我们的参谋人员对毛主席的十条军事原则和林司令员的战术思想，战争作风贯彻得很不深入，某些部队在执行中发生了许多偏向。参谋人员本身对这方面的学习也相当差。其次是在保证首长能采取有充分根据的决心，从组织上保证首长决心的实现等也还不够；部队管理工作做得不够好，减员现象仍存在，部队编制上非战斗人员之比例仍甚大；在工作作风与方式上还缺乏组织性经常性，以及粗枝大叶的现象。产生这些缺点的原因首先是对参谋工作的看法有偏差，参谋人员不安于自己的工作，有些指挥员由于游击习气及手工业工作方式，不善于使用司令机关，因而对参谋工作不够重视，领导和帮助也就很差，使各级司令部工作与各级指挥员的工作脱节，形成所谓“两条线”的现象，而不是首长很好经过司令部去指挥部队。其次是参谋人员一般文化水准不高，军事知识与修养跟不上工作的需要。为克服上述缺点，加强今后参谋工作，刘参谋长提出四点努力方向：（一）参谋人员应重视本身工作，认识参谋工作的好坏是直接影响战斗和作战效果的，现代战争中没有坚强的参谋工作是不能顺利的指挥军队的。（二）各级参谋长要成为司令部工作的直接主持者与组织者。（三）消灭“两条线”现象，使指挥与组织和保证指挥的工作正确的结合起来，使首长成为领导司令部的负责人，参谋长成为直接组织司令部工作的负责人。（四）提倡组织性，迅速，准确，严格，艰苦朴素的参谋工作作风。最后刘参谋长并号召全体参谋人员积极学习军事政治，尤其要熟练参谋业务，以推动和保证参谋工作不断进步。
