Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 30th -- Following the correction of errors infringing upon industry and commerce in the Jin-Cha-Ji region, local industry and commerce are flourishing with the strong support of the democratic government. In Ding County City, Ji-Zhong, the number of newly added industrial and commercial businesses has reached 51. The nationally renowned Bai Jingyu Eye Medicine Factory and Da Zhong Yin Bank, among others, have resumed operations one after another. Every market day, more than 30,000 people from the surrounding villages flock to the city. Since the return of goods and tools to 39 industrial and commercial households in Qing County that were encroached upon during the land reform, the number of new industrial and commercial businesses has reached 55. After understanding the industrial and commercial policies and dispelling unnecessary concerns, industrial and commercial households in Botou Township are actively developing their businesses. The border region bank has issued industrial and commercial loans totaling 1.2 billion border region currency units, exceeding the amount issued last winter by four times. A certain cargo depot in the city achieved a single-day transaction volume of 150 million currency units. The area is currently stepping up preparations for a temple fair. The tendency to infringe upon industry and commerce in Hunyuan, Fanshi, Wutai, Dingxiang, Jingxing, Huolu, Fuping, and Xingtang areas of the North Yue Region has also been corrected one after another. Currently, there are 1,805 industrial and commercial households in Hunyuan City, exceeding the number during the period of Japanese rule by a hundredfold, and exceeding the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan by 66%. A certain private factory in Mancheng has grown from a share capital of 60,000 yuan, two machines, and four workers to a share capital of 55 million yuan, 916 times the previous amount, with more than 60 workers and 34 machines.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 1st -- The Ji-Zhong branch of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank recently organized industrial and commercial loans worth 500,000,000 border region currency units to support self-sufficiency industries and encourage small-scale operations. The focus of the loans is on self-sufficiency industries such as textiles, agricultural tool manufacturing, shipbuilding, papermaking, saltpeter boiling, oil pressing, shoemaking, flour milling, leather making, dyeing, and chemicals. In the commercial sector, emphasis is placed on small-scale operations and transportation that are beneficial to production. General commerce will be supported through current account branch payments and business dealings. It is also stipulated that all public and private factories, workshops, vendors, commercial firms, or small-scale individual operators in both urban and rural areas that are beneficial to mass production and the needs of the war can contact local banks for loans.
