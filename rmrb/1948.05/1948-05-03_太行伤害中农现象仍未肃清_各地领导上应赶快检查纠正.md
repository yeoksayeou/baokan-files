[Comprehensive News from This Newspaper] The "leftist" phenomenon of repelling and infringing upon middle peasants still exists in some areas of Taihang. One situation is the completely uncompensated use of middle peasants' livestock and vehicles. In Shizhuang, Fourth District of Yuanshi, the carts of three well-to-do middle peasant households were used to transport grain, and all the money earned went to the poor and hired peasants. Even the poor and hired peasants who did not participate in the transportation received 6,000 yuan. In Songcao Village, Sixth District, middle peasants' carts were used to transport relief grain and chaff to poor and hired peasants. In Gangwang Village, middle peasants' livestock were used to till land for poor and hired peasants for free. The same was true in Menglin Village and others in the Seventh District. The second situation is borrowing land and grain. Of the sixteen households whose land was recently borrowed in Dongyuan Village, New District of Yuanshi, one-third were well-to-do middle peasants. In Zhitun, Fifth District, eighteen of the thirty households whose land was borrowed were middle peasants. Wu Sanmao, a middle peasant in Huayuan Village, had twelve mu of his twenty-two mu of land borrowed. In Tianquankou, Fifth District, middle peasants' fodder was borrowed to feed livestock. In the Second District of Shouyang, fifty shi of grain were borrowed from middle peasants. In Shangxu Commune, Lingchuan, village cadres asked middle peasants to voluntarily report grain to be borrowed for poor and hired peasants. More than ten middle peasant households voluntarily reported four dou, three dou, or two dou each. One young middle peasant had no grain at home but also voluntarily reported three dou. His father was very worried, and the young man said, "We have to report it, or they will make trouble for us... Even if we don't eat, we have to borrow it for them. Let's borrow three dou from the saltpeter workshop." This situation is not uncommon in various places. Obviously, this is not ordinary borrowing but "donation." When poor and hired peasants in the Fifth District of Yuanshi lacked seeds, they simply asked the middle peasants to "support" more than one shi of sorghum. The third situation is that cooperatives and mutual aid teams exploit middle peasants to take care of poor peasants. In Yucheng County, the money earned by middle and poor peasants in winter mutual aid production was divided according to a ratio of six for the poor and four for the middle. In Xizhang Village, Fifth District of Changzhi, mutual aid wages were divided into three grades: landlords received half a sheng of rice per workday, middle peasants received half a sheng, and poor peasants received two sheng. In Fangjiapu Mutual Aid Team (with both middle and poor peasants) in the Tenth District of Xingtai, after indigo was sold, the middle peasants wanted to divide the money for spending, but the poor peasants refused, wanting to keep it to take care of the poor and hired. Some villages' mutual aid teams required middle peasants to clear their debts to poor peasants every five days, while poor peasants' debts to middle peasants were repaid after the harvest, and could be waived if they could not be repaid. In Pingchang Village, Fifth District of Shexian County, middle peasant teams could not be selected as model mutual aid teams no matter how well they did during the selection of model mutual aid teams last year. (Some of these situations occurred last year, some have been cleared up, and some have not yet been cleared up.) The fourth situation is increasing the burden on middle peasants. In some villages in Wu'an, poor peasants were automatically exempted from corvée labor, military shoes, and other duties, which were borne mostly or entirely by middle peasants. In addition, middle peasant households in difficulty were not given loans, or the loans were forcibly taken back after they were given. Not allowing middle peasants to participate in discussions about loans is even more common.

The reasons for these situations are, first of all, insufficient policy education for cadres by the leadership. Many cadres have replaced correct policy thinking with a one-sided poor and hired peasant viewpoint, and replaced the complete class line with a narrow "poor and hired peasant line." Comrade Yin Wenxiu of the Fifth District Work Team of Yuanshi believed that "using middle peasants' livestock for transportation and distributing money to poor and hired peasants is to rely on the poor and hired to unite the middle peasants." Many cadres in the county only remembered the sentence "first satisfy the demands of the poor and hired," and did not care about anything else. In Zikeng Village, Yuci, an old man was classified as a middle peasant (actually a poor peasant) during the "Three Check-ups" last year, and hanged himself. The cadres said, "It was a middle peasant who died," as if it was nothing. Some cadres in Wu'an said, "The landlords have no more to offer, and the middle peasants are not allowed to be touched, so how can the poor peasants turn over? How can the difficulties in the lives of the poor peasants be solved?" Whenever they encountered difficulties, they wanted to find a way out from the middle peasants. Secondly, some villages established "poor and hired peasant groups" last winter and this spring. The membership was impure, and they were manipulated by some hooligans who took advantage of the regulations on punishing violations of the Land Law Outline to restrict the economic activities of middle peasants, or misinterpreted the Land Law Outline to threaten and extort middle peasants. The "poor peasant group" of Shenjiaping, Pingchun, with more than thirty people, planned to distribute middle peasant women by drawing paper bullets; and forbade middle peasants to sell grain. A middle peasant in Dujiatai, Neiqiu, earned 15,000 yuan from selling persimmon cakes, and He Fubao, a member of the "poor peasant group," insisted on borrowing it for spending. When the middle peasant said he would use it to buy farm tools, He said he was "wasting" money. One day, when Miao San, a middle peasant in Kangsucun Village, Fourth District of Wu'an, was grinding flour, Wu Goudan, who claimed to be from the "poor and hired peasant group," saw him and said, "The Land Law Outline has been issued for a long time, and you are still grinding flour!" He then took half of the middle peasant's wheat. One day, when Miao San carried a dou of wheat to sell, Wu Goudan saw him and said, "Are you violating the Outline again?" Miao San was afraid and bought him several packs of cigarettes to get rid of him. In addition, there were some bad village cadres who organized poor peasant groups to act recklessly, or "in order to please the poor and hired, so that the poor and hired would not criticize them in the future, even if they knew that the poor and hired were doing wrong and harming the middle peasants, they would not speak out, and even think of some ways (mostly harming the middle peasants) to allow the poor peasants to obtain benefits through incorrect methods" (Wu'an ×× Village).

It is natural that the middle peasants are dissatisfied when they are harmed; are the poor peasants satisfied? When Xinxiang Village, Shahe, reorganized its village finances last year, it was in deficit and mobilized more than one million yuan from all the middle peasants. The middle peasants had no money and wanted to hand over grain, but the director of the poor and hired said that they had to hand over wheat. The hired worker Zhu Wencang said that it was difficult to get wheat, the middle peasants did not have it, and it was the same to hand over grain. The director of the poor and hired quarreled with him. Zhu thought he was oppressing the middle peasants, said the poor and hired peasant group was not good, and withdrew from it. He said, "I am fifty-seven years old this year, and I will not participate in the poor and hired peasant group even if I live for another forty years!" Because the middle peasants were infringed upon, the poor and hired peasants fundamentally regarded their own organization (the poor and hired peasant group) as an organization of bad people and resolutely opposed it. Some other poor and hired peasants in the village also said, "The middle peasants have earned their family property through labor, and it is not right to touch it!" Poor peasants in Zhajiazhuang, Heshun, said, "Song Runlin (a middle peasant) donated livestock, and now he has difficulty raising seedlings and even has nothing to eat. Let's return what he donated." The truly hard-working and upright poor peasants do not agree with infringing upon their laboring brothers (the middle peasants).

Many of these phenomena have been corrected, but many have not yet been corrected. At the end of April, the Taihang Xinhua Daily analyzed the reasons for the failure to completely correct them, saying: "Some (cadres) believe that returning things to the middle peasants is a blow to the poor and hired, and needs to be turned around slowly. Therefore, when they just promoted unity with the middle peasants, they saw that some middle peasants were happy, and they were afraid that this happiness would stimulate the poor and hired, and they dared not continue to do so... Some have already distributed the middle peasants' things and emphasized that it is impossible to compensate. Or they think that the middle peasants can still maintain their lives and remain silent." This means that they are still unconditionally accommodating backwardness, acting as a tail, or blindly and unconsciously clinging to mistakes, and not seeing the evil consequences that have already occurred.

### 太行伤害中农现象仍未肃清　各地领导上应赶快检查纠正

　　太行伤害中农现象仍未肃清
  　各地领导上应赶快检查纠正
    【本报综合消息】排斥与侵犯中农的“左”倾现象，在太行若干地区仍然存在着。一种情形是完全无代价的使用中农牲口车辆。元氏四区使庄用三户富裕中农的大车去运粮，赚的钱全部归贫雇。没参加运粮的贫雇也分到六千元。六区宋曹村用中农的大车给贫雇运救济粮和糠菜。岗汪村用中农牲口白给贫雇耕地。七区孟林等村亦如此。第二种是借地借粮。元氏新区东原庄最近被借地的十六户，三分之一是富裕中农。五区纸屯被抽借地三十户，有十八户是中农。花园村中农武三毛家二十二亩地，被借去十二亩。五区天全口借中农草料喂牲口。寿阳二区向中农借粮五十石。陵川上徐社村干部叫中农自报借粮给贫雇。有十多户中农，自报四斗、三斗、二斗的都有，有一个中农青年家里没粮，也自报了三斗，他父亲很发愁，青年说：“咱不报不行，人家要给咱找麻烦哩。………咱就不吃也得借给人家，咱到硝坊借三斗出了吧。”这种情形，各地还不少。显然，这并不是一般的借贷，而是“捐”。元氏五区贫雇缺种子，则干脆叫中农“拥护”了一石多高粱。第三种是合作社、互助组内以剥夺中农来照顾贫农。榆次县中贫农在冬季互助生产中赚的钱，按贫六中四分。长治五区西掌村互助工资分三等：地主一工米半升，中农升半，贫农二升。邢台十区放甲铺互助组（中贫农都有）卖了靛，中农要分钱花，贫农不叫，要留下来照顾贫雇。有些村的互助组是中农欠了贫农米，五天一清；贫农欠了中农，收割以后还，还不起可以不还。涉县五区平上村，去年选模范互助组时，中农组怎好也不能当选。（这一种，有些是去年情形，有的现已清理，有的还没清理。）第四种是加重中农负担。武安有些村自动减免贫农差役、军鞋等勤务，由中农多出甚至全出。此外，不给中农困难户贷款，或贷给后又强制收回；贷款不让中农参加讨论的事，就更不用说了。
    这些情形发生的原因，首先是领导上对干部进行政策教育不够。有许多干部以片面的贫雇观点代替了正确的政策思想，以狭隘的“贫雇路线”代替了完整的阶级路线。元氏五区工作队尹文秀同志认为“用中农牲口运输、贫雇分钱，就是依靠贫雇团结中农。”该县许多干部只记住一句“首先满足贫雇要求”，其他就什么也不管了。榆次紫坑村一个老汉在去年三查时被划为中农（实际是贫农），上吊死了，干部说：“死的是中农”，以为没有什么。武安有些干部说：“地主没油水了，中农又不准动，贫农怎么翻身？贫农的生活困难怎么解决？”他们一碰到困难，就想在中农身上找出路。其次，有些村庄去冬今春成立了“贫雇团”，成份不纯，被若干流氓分子钻进去操纵起来，利用破坏土地法大纲治罪条例，限制中农经济活动，或不正确的解释土地法大纲，威胁敲诈中农。平顺申家坪“贫农团”三十多人，把中农女人用抓纸弹办法做了计划，准备分配；不准中农卖粮食。内邱杜家台有个中农卖柿饼得钱一万五，“贫农团”一个叫和富保的就非要借去花了不可。人家说买农具用了，他说人家是“浪费”。武安四区康宿村中农苗三正在磨面，自称“贫雇团”的武狗旦看见了就说：“法大纲早就下来啦，你还磨面哩！”说着就把人家麦子拿了一半走了。苗三有一天背一斗麦子去卖，狗旦看见了又说：“你又违了纲啦吧？”苗三害怕，给他买了几盒纸烟才完事。另外，也有一些是坏村干自己组织贫农团来胡闹，或“为了讨好贫雇，叫贫雇将来不给自己提意见，明知贫雇办的不对，损害了中农，也不说话，甚至自己也想些办法（多是损害中农），叫贫农用不正确的方法得利益”（武安××村）。
    伤害了中农，中农不满是当然的；贫农是不是满意呢？沙河新庄去年整理村财政时，亏空了，曾向全体中农动员一百多万元。中农没钱，要交谷，贫雇主任说是非要麦不行。雇工朱文苍说麦子困难，中农没有，就要谷也一样。贫雇主任就跟他吵了一顿。朱认为压迫中农，说贫雇团不好，就退出来。他说：“我今年五十七岁，再活四十岁也不参加贫雇团！”因为侵害了中农，贫雇农把自己的组织（贫雇团）也根本看成了坏人的组织，坚决反对起来。该村另外一些贫雇农也说：“中农是劳动置下的家业，动人家就不应该！”和顺翟家庄贫农说：“宋润林（中农）献了牲口，今年养种困难，吃的也没有，把献的东西退回吧。”真正劳动正派的贫农，并不同意侵害自己的劳动弟兄（中农）。
    这些现象，有许多已经做了纠正，但也有许多仍未纠正。四月底太行新华日报分析未能彻底纠正的原因说：“有的（干部）认为给中农退东西是对贫雇的打击，需要慢慢往过转。因此刚刚才宣传团结中农时，看到有些中农高兴了，就怕这种高兴刺激了贫雇，不敢再往下做。………有的把中农东西已经分配了，强调无法补尝。或者认为中农还可以维护生活，不声不响算了。”这就是说，他们仍在无原则的迁就落后，做尾巴，或盲目地、非意识地坚持错误，看不见已经发生的恶果。
