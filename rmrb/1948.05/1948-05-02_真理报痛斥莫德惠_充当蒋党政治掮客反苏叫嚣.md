Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Moscow, 25th: *Pravda*'s commentator recently published an article vehemently denouncing Mo Teh-hui, a political broker of the Chiang clique, who, in his capacity as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Review Committee of the pseudo-National Assembly, issued an anti-Soviet statement saying that "the Sino-Soviet Treaty has lost its meaning." *Pravda* wrote: "This simple and surprising statement fully illustrates the mood of the reactionary Kuomintang leaders and provides a vivid explanation of the policies they have adopted, which are based on serving the interests of foreign imperialism and hating the Soviet Union as much as they hate the Chinese republican system and the Chinese people. As is well known, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, signed on August 14, 1945, for a term of 30 years, has been and remains, as it is written in the treaty, aimed at preventing Japan from rising again to aggression and at providing mutual assistance immediately when such aggression occurs. Therefore, this treaty is the foundation of China's independence and security. There is no doubt that the broad masses of the Chinese people and progressive people highly cherish this treaty, especially now that Japanese imperialism and the potential of Japanese war industry are being spared no effort to be restored. The friendly and allied relations between the Soviet Union and the Chinese people are the foundation of peace and security in the Far East. The Chinese people highly value friendship with the Soviet Union and regard the Soviet Union as a powerful defender of peace and security for all countries. The lackeys of foreign imperialism cannot destroy this friendship; their anti-Soviet clamor only exposes that they are the irreconcilable enemies of the Chinese people."

　　真理报痛斥莫德惠
  　充当蒋党政治掮客反苏叫嚣
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】莫斯科二十五日讯：真理报观察家顷对蒋党政治掮客莫德惠，以伪国大外交审查委员会主席资格发表反苏声明谓“中苏条约已失去意义了”一事著文痛斥。真理报写道：“这一简单而令人惊讶的声明，充分说明了反动的国民党领袖的心情，并为他们所采取的政策提供了生动的说明，他们的这个政策是以服务于外国帝国主义利益，以及如同仇视中国的共和政体与中国人民一样仇视苏联为基础的。众所周知：一九四五年八月十四日所签订，为期三十年的中苏友好同盟条约，曾经而且仍然如同该约所写的一样，其目的在防止日本再起侵略，并当此种侵略一旦发生时立即实行互助。因此，这一条约是中国独立与安全的基础。毫无疑问，中国人民大众与进步人士高度珍视这一条约，特别是在现在日本帝国主义和日本战争工业潜力正被不遗余力地加以恢复这样的时候。苏联与中国人民间的友好与同盟关系，乃是远东和平与安全的基础。中国人民高度重视对苏友谊，认为苏联是各国和平与安全的强有力的卫士。外国帝国主义的走狗是破坏不了这种友谊的，他们反苏的叫嚣仅仅暴露了他们是中国人民不共戴天的敌人。”
