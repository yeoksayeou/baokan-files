Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 19th: The Jizhong District Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions, pointing out that the principles of the district's industrial conference have not been well implemented in most areas, specifically manifested in: (1) General Party committees neglect industrial and labor movement work, have not studied the decisions of the industrial conference, and mostly assign this work to trade unions and industrial and commercial cadres. Most trade union cadres have also been assigned to land reform work. (2) Some state-owned factories are still operating without systems, producing blindly, and have not inspected serious waste phenomena, do not care about the lives and welfare of workers, and simply engage in capital reduction, resulting in antagonism with workers, low worker morale, and unnecessary losses in production. (3) Among the workers, there is still a "Leftist" adventurism of liquidating factories, treating the factory management of state-owned factories as capitalists, distrusting staff, guildism, and anarchistic thinking. (4) Government industrial and commercial departments, industrial companies, banks, and stores each manage their own affairs, and their strength is dispersed, failing to form a unified force for developing industry and commerce. The idea of developing industry and commerce is also unclear. Banks blindly carried out deposit and loan activities in the past, and now only want to support industry with deposits, without stipulating the amount and time of loans based on industrial needs. It is good that stores pay attention to stabilizing prices, but they lack the idea of further supporting industrial production from the supply and sales aspects. Industrial and commercial departments are still busy with tax collection work, using old methods, and the idea of developing industry is also very vague. The instructions stated that the basic reason for the above-mentioned undesirable phenomena is that cadres at all levels of the Party committee have been working in rural areas for a long time and do not understand the Party's industrial policy, the line of the workers' movement, the development of the current war situation, and the favorable conditions and importance of Jizhong's development of industry. Regarding how to implement the principles of the industrial conference in the future, the instructions emphasized that, first, it is necessary to overcome narrow and conservative views based on the long-term goals of building the liberated areas, and Party committees at all levels should place this work in an appropriate position and earnestly implement the principles of the industrial conference, understanding that this is the task of the entire Party. Second, it is necessary to strengthen labor movement work and continue to correct "Leftist" adventurist thinking and actions, while also ensuring a certain living standard for workers, and neither should be neglected. In state-owned factories, develop production competitions, cultivate model workers, and establish the idea of building the country. In private factories, educate workers to abide by labor discipline, increase production, and benefit both labor and capital in order to prosper the economy of the liberated areas for long-term interests. Third, state-owned factories should quickly and effectively implement enterprise management, overcome bureaucratization and blindness, eliminate all corruption and waste phenomena, and formulate production plans to achieve high output, good quality, and low cost, leading private factories to work together to build a new democratic society.

　　冀中党委指示工业政策
  　克服狭隘保守观点
  　继续纠正左倾错误
    【新华社晋察冀十九日电】中共冀中区党委日前发出指示，指出该区工业会议方针在大多数地区尚未很好贯彻，具体表现在：（一）一般党委会忽略工业与工运工作，对工业会议的决定并未研究，大多将此项工作交给工会与工商干部去作。大部工会干部并被分配去作土地改革工作。（二）某些公营工厂仍是漫无制度，盲目生产，对于严重的浪费现象仍未检查，不关心工人的生活与福利，单纯闹减资，结果造成与工人对立，工人生产情绪低落，使生产受到不必要的损失。（三）工人当中仍存在着清算工厂，将公营工厂的厂方当成资本家看待的左倾冒险主义、不相信职员、行会主义、无政府思想。（四）政府工商部门、实业公司、银行、商店各管各的，力量分散，没有形成发展工商业的一个统一力量。发展工商业的思想也不明确，银行贷款过去盲目的开展存放款，现在仅想以存款扶持工业，不从工业需要规定贷款数量及时间。商店注意稳定物价是好的，但缺乏进一步从供销上扶持工业生产的思想。工商部门仍是忙于税收工作，方法老一套，发展工业的思想也很模糊。指示称：发生以上不良现象，其基本原因是各级党委干部长期在农村工作，不了解党的工业政策、职工运动的路线及今天战争形势的发展，和冀中发展工业的有利条件与其重要性。并于今后如何贯彻工业会议方针，该指示着重指出，第一，必须从建设解放区远大目标出发，克服狭隘的保守观点，各级党委应将这一工作放在适当的位置，认真贯彻工业会议方针，要懂得这是全党的任务。第二，要加强工运工作，并继续纠正左倾冒险主义的思想与行动，同时也要保证工人的一定生活水平，二者不可偏废。在公营工厂中，发展生产竞赛，培养模范工人，树立建设国家的思想。在私营工厂中，教育工人为了长远利益，遵守劳动纪律，增加生产，劳资两利，繁荣解放区的经济。第三，公营工厂应迅速而切实的施行企业化，克服机关化与盲目性，肃清一切贪污浪费现象，制定生产计划，作到产量多，质量好，成本低，带动私人工厂共同为建设新民主主义社会而奋斗。
