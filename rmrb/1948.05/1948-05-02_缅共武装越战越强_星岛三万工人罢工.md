Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Rangoon dispatch: The people's armed forces under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party continue to launch successful attacks in the areas of Yemeisheng, Pingman, and Pegu, near Rangoon in central Burma, and threaten the railway traffic line from Rangoon to Mandalay. The reactionary government of Thakin Nu has been forced to announce that night trains between Rangoon and Mandalay will be temporarily suspended from the 25th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Singapore dispatch: The 24-hour general strike launched by the local General Labour Union was held as scheduled on the 23rd, with 35,000 workers participating. Transportation and municipal affairs in the port were thus paralyzed. It is reported that some ships left the port without unloading. The striking workers insisted on wage increases and protested against the authorities' recent reactionary measures of illegally searching trade union offices and arresting trade union leaders.
