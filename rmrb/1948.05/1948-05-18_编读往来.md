　　Letters to the Editor
    Children of Landlords and Rich Peasants in School
    Should Also Have Democratic Rights
To the Editorial Staff:
    1. Landlords and rich peasants' children are allowed to attend school because they have not directly exploited the peasants. Letting them go to school is a form of education and transformation. Now, most of them are in school. When the students in the school hold elections for the student union, do they have the right to vote and be elected?
    2. During the movement, some landlord and rich peasant women married poor peasants, hired peasants, and demobilized soldiers just to avoid struggle. According to the central government's instructions, landlord and rich peasant women are now free to divorce and marry as they please. Now that marriage is free, they are allowed to do so. However, some people say that they married just to avoid struggle at the time, and now that they are not afraid, they should not be allowed to divorce. Should this kind of divorce be allowed or not?
    3. There is a woman in Wuxiang who married an army cadre, and she is also working in the army now. Her mother's family only has an old mother with no labor. She wants to ask someone to cultivate the land for her mother's family. Should the land be cultivated by the man's family or both families, since she is married, or does the woman have inheritance rights, so the mother's family can also have someone cultivate the land?
  　Liu Zhixiang, May 3
Comrade Zhixiang:
    1. Children of landlords and rich peasants in school should enjoy the same rights to vote and be elected as the children of the working people. In addition to strengthening ideological education for children of landlords and rich peasants, they should not be treated specially in schools.
    2. Whether or not to divorce should be handled in accordance with the marriage regulations stipulated by the government. There is no need to have special restrictions because she is a landlord or rich peasant woman.
    3. If the woman you mentioned meets the conditions for the government's regulations on substitute cultivation, then she should be allowed to have someone cultivate the land. The family of a daughter working in the army can enjoy the same treatment as the family of a son working in the army as revolutionary army dependents.

　　The 56 Landlord and Rich Peasant Households in Nanlixin Were Classified Last Year
To the Editorial Staff:
    The Central Bureau's instructions to Taihang on correcting left-leaning adventurism, published in your newspaper on the 3rd, stated that in Nanlixin Village, Xiangyuan, out of a total of 254 households, 56 households were classified as landlords and rich peasants, accounting for over 22% of the village's households. We had sent this class classification material to the Xinhua Daily, listing the class figures that were classified before this filling-in (the figures classified last year) and then the new class classification figures this time. It must have been mistakenly printed. Last year, in Nanlixin, out of 254 households in the whole village, 35 households were classified as landlords, 29 households as rich peasants, 78 households as middle peasants, and 122 households as poor peasants. Landlords and rich peasants accounted for over 25% of the village's households, and 37 middle peasants and 6 poor peasants were wrongly struggled against (including 9 well-to-do middle peasants). This time, based on the new class classification standards, after self-reporting, public discussion, and three rounds of public announcement, the village currently has 246 households (because 6 landlord households fled and 2 poor peasant households returned to their original residences). A total of 4 landlord households, 11 rich peasant households, 9 well-to-do middle peasant households, 96 middle peasant households, and 126 poor peasant households were classified. Landlords and rich peasants account for over 6% of the village's households. After studying the documents and checking and correcting left-leaning adventurism in the work, the class classification was re-examined. One vagrant was classified out of the four landlord households. The village currently has 3 landlord households, 96 rich peasant households, 126 poor peasant households, and 1 vagrant household. We hope you will check how the mistake was made and correct it.
　　　　　　　　（Second District Working Group）
Second District Working Group:
    The class classification of Nanlixin (see the front page of this newspaper on March 19), the manuscript was from Taihang Branch, and it said: "There are a total of 254 households in this village, 27 landlord households, 29 rich peasant households..." Was this class classification newly classified or from the past? It was not explained in the article. Please have the Taihang Branch check the original manuscript.

　　Answers to Several Questions in the Class Classification in Zanhuang
To the Editorial Staff:
    During this summary, we are unclear about two questions related to class classification. Please answer:
    1. Regarding the status and treatment of households with excessive land: After the May 4th Instructions, some poor peasants and hired peasants became well-off and rose to become middle peasants or well-to-do middle peasants. Their land yield exceeded the village average. According to the class classification regulations, they should be established as middle peasants. How should the excessive land, houses, etc., be handled? According to the Central Government, is it extracted or returned, and the consent of the person must be obtained. Should it be returned as it is over-occupied, not extracted. Which is better? Many documents and newspapers only say that cadres and party members must return the land they occupy excessively. So, do non-cadre party members have to return it? If the treatment of middle peasants is followed, even if the person voluntarily agrees, the area cannot exceed 20 percent. Then the extracted land is very small. Not to mention the emancipation of poor peasants and hired peasants, even the compensation for wrongly struggled middle peasants and the resettlement of landlords and rich peasants will become a problem. If it is over-occupied, they should not be classified as well-to-do middle peasants. What is the right thing to do? This time we treated them as returning the excess and not within the 20 percent area, and all the components were classified as middle peasants. Is this right?
    2. Regarding the issue of wrongly struggled middle peasants: If a well-to-do middle peasant or middle peasant is wrongly struggled and downgraded to a poor peasant, he should be classified as a poor peasant in the class classification. We feel that it is not appropriate to classify them as poor peasants because they were wrongly struggled. They should not be poor peasants in the first place. What should they be classified as? If they are classified as poor peasants, then they will be treated as poor peasants, and there will be no compensation for the wrongly struggled middle peasants. If it is compensation for the wrongly struggled middle peasants, then they should not be classified as poor peasants. Which one is right? We still classified them as middle peasants. This time, the compensation is the same as for poor peasants and hired peasants, and they are still compensated to the level of middle peasants. If they were well-to-do middle peasants before, they will not be compensated to the level of well-to-do middle peasants this time, which is equivalent to extraction. Is this the right thing to do?
    3. Regarding a problem in the calculation of rich peasants: There is a phenomenon in the semi-old district of Zanhuang where the labor force in the family participates in the puppet government or puppet army work. If the person is a well-to-do middle peasant at home, but the family has to hire labor to farm because they participate in the puppet army work, and the family has no labor or no main labor, and relies entirely or mostly on exploiting hired labor for more than three consecutive years. According to the original component, it is a middle peasant or a well-to-do middle peasant, and the land occupied is not too much, but according to the exploitative relationship, it is a rich peasant. How to determine this component? Although some have declined after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, it is still not enough for three years.
    4. Regarding a problem in the exploitation ratio of rich peasants: According to the calculation results in Chapter 7, Section 6 of the Class Classification Regulations, the labor force of peasants and the labor force of hired workers are equal, or do not exceed 25 percent. Is this algorithm fixed? Or is it calculated based on the actual situation? That is to say, the actual wage and food ration are higher or lower than what is said in the regulations, and the resulting percentage will naturally be different. Can it be calculated according to Section 6, or can it be calculated according to the actual situation? We calculated according to the actual situation, is that right?
    Zanhuang County Committee, Li Yinggui
Comrade Li Yinggui: 1. The middle peasants who became well-off after the May 4th Instructions, if the land exceeding the average is obtained through extra gains, it should be returned during the filling-in process, and non-party member cadres must also return it. It is not necessary to treat them the same as ordinary middle peasants. The extraction of land must be voluntary. This is because it is a gain from extra gains, not income from labor. It is right for you to classify them as middle peasants but return the land as extra gains. 2. Wrongly struggled middle peasants should still be classified as middle peasants. It is generally acceptable to compensate them to the level of ordinary middle peasants. However, it is necessary to take care of the demands and emotions of the middle peasants, emphasize the unity between the middle and poor peasants, and reach a reasonable solution through consultation. 3. According to the class classification regulations, if people meet other conditions similar to landlords or rich peasants, but their occupation status (land and other property) does not exceed that of ordinary middle peasants, they should not be considered landlords or rich peasants. However, it is impossible to determine the components of these households you mentioned because the labor situation of these households is not known. In principle, if they still participate in the main agricultural labor in their families, they should be considered middle peasants or other peasant components according to their occupation status. Those who have other occupations should determine their components according to other occupations. Those who have no fixed occupation or lose their ability to work should be considered poor people. Those who can work but do not work, or engage in improper occupations, should be considered vagrants. Regarding the issue of hiring workers in the family of puppet soldiers, please refer to the Letters to the Editor in this newspaper on May 14, answering Comrade Jianhua. 4. When calculating the exploitation income of rich peasants in class classification, excessive or insufficient wages and food rations will affect their exploitation income. When these situations are encountered, the specific situation should be accurately calculated, and it should be what it is. The regulations on the document refer to the general situation.

　　编读往来
    地主富农子弟在校
    应同样有民主权利编报同志：
    一、允许地富儿童入学，因为他没有直接剥削过农民，让其上学教育改造，现在大部上学了，这些学生在学校进行选举学生会等，是不是有选举权及被选举权？
    二、地主富农的女人在运动中嫁了贫雇及荣退事人，当时为了躲斗争勉强嫁的现在据中央指示说地主富农女人离婚结婚听便。现在要按婚姻自由是可以允许的。但有些人说当时为了怕斗争嫁的，现在离婚是不怕了，离婚是不应该允许她。这个问题究竟该离婚不该离呢？
    三、武乡有个女人嫁了军队干部，现在这女人也在部队工作，她娘家只有老娘没劳力，她要叫给她娘家代耕。这个问题按嫁了男人婆家双代耕呢，还是女人有继产权，娘家也能代耕呢？
  　刘致祥　五月三日致祥同志：
    一、地富儿童在学校应和劳动人民的子弟一样享有选举权和被选举权。对地富儿童除加强思想教育外，在学校里不应对他们特殊看待。
    二、应否离婚，可按政府规定的婚姻条例处理，不必因是地主富农女人而有特殊限制。
    三、你提的这个女人家若符合于政府规定代耕办法的条件，就应该代耕。女儿在部队工作和儿子在部队工作，其家庭一样可以享受革命军人家属待遇。

　　南里信地主富农五十六户是去年旧的划分编辑同志：
    贵报三号登的中央局给太行纠正左倾冒险主义指示，说襄垣南里信全村二百五十四户，即划地富五十六户，占全村户数百分之二二强。这个划阶级材料，我们曾给新华日报寄过，内容是先将在这次填补前划的阶级数字（系去年划的数字）列明后，又将这次新的划阶级数字写法，想是误登了。南里信在去年划阶级全村二百五十四户，即划地主三十五户、富农二十九户、中农七十八户、贫农一百二十二户，地主富农占全村户数百分之二五强，错斗了中农卅七户、贫农六户（中农内有富裕中农九户）。在这次以新的划阶级标准，经过自报公议三榜定案，全村现有户数二百四十六户（因地主逃亡六户，贫农回原籍二户），共计划出地主四户、富农十一户、富裕中农九户、中农九十六户、贫农一百二十六户、地主富农占全村户数百分之六强。经学习了文件，检查纠正工作中左倾冒险主义，又将划阶级经过重行检查，地主四户内又划出一户游民。全村现有地主三户，富农九十六户、贫农一百二十六户、游民一户。以上情况，希检查是怎样搞错的，并希更正。　　　　　　　　
　　（二区工作组）二区工作组：
    南里信的阶级划分（见本报三月十九号头条），该稿系太行分社来稿，文里说：“这村共二百五十四户，地主二十七户，富农二十九户……………。”这种阶级划分，到底是新划的还是过去的？文中未加说明，请太行分社将原稿做一检查。  　　　　　　　——编者
　　赞皇划阶级中几个问题的答复编辑同志：
    在这次总结中，有关划阶级的两个问题我们闹不清，请答复：
    一、关于多占户的成份及待遇问题：五四指示以后，有一部份贫雇，翻身过高，上升成中农或富裕中农，土地产量超出全村平均数，按划阶级规定应成立中农成份，但他们多占的土地房屋等如何处理？按中央待遇是抽不是退，须取得本人同意，按多占应退不是抽，这究竟按那个好？见到许多文件和报纸上只是说干部党员多占一定要退出，那么非干部党员多占是否要退出呢？如果按中农待遇，就是取得本人自愿也不能超过百分之二十的面，那么抽的土地是很少的，别说贫雇翻身，就是斗错的中农补偿，和地富安置都成问题。如是多占就不应该划成富裕中农，究竟怎样作对？我们这一次是把他们当成多占退了不在百分之二十面以内，成份都划成中农了，这样是否对？
    二、关于错斗中农的成份问题：富裕中农或中农错斗以后降为贫农，划阶级中应成为贫农成份，我们感到划为贫农又不合适，因错斗了，本不应该是贫农，到底划成什么？如果划成贫农，那就按贫农待遇，就无所谓补偿错斗中农了。如果是赔偿错斗中农，就不应该划成贫农，哪个对？我们是仍划为中农了。这次补偿中按贫雇一样补起来，仍补到中农，如前是富裕中农这次也不再补到富裕中农，等于抽了。这样作是否对？
    三、关于计算富农中一个问题：赞皇半老区有一种现象是家里的劳力参加伪政府或伪军工作，如果本人在家就是个富裕中农，参加伪军工作，家庭就须雇工养种，家庭无劳力或无主要劳力，全部或大部靠剥削雇工，并连续三年以上。按原成份是中农或富裕中农，土地占有也不太多，按剥削关系是富农。这种成份如何确定呢？虽有些在日寇投降后已下降，但仍不够三年。
    四、关于富农剥削比例中一个问题：按划阶级规定第七章第六节计算结果，农民劳力和雇工劳力相等，还是不超过百分之二十五，这个算法是死的呢？还是根据实际情况计算？就是说，实际的工资吃粮比规定上所说的高或低得出来的百分比也自然不同了，这可按第六节所说计算，可按实际情况计算？我们按实际计算了是否对。
    赞皇县委会李英贵李英贵同志：一、五四指示后翻身的中农，其超出平均数的土地，若系多得果实地，填补中应该退出，不是党员干部也一样得退。不必和对待一般中农一样抽动土地必须本人自愿。四为这是多得果实，不是劳动所得。你们把他们划成中农但土地作为多占果实退出是对的。二、错斗中农仍应划成中农。补偿他们时，补到一般中农程度，原则上是可以的，你们的作法一般是对的。但必须照顾中农的要求和情绪，强调中贫农间的团结，以协商方式取得合理解决。三、按照划阶级规定，如果人们其他条件与地主或富农相同，但其占有状况（土地和其他财产），不超过一般中农的，则不应认为是地主或富农，但就你提的这些户还没法确定其成份，因为不知道这些户的劳动情况，原则上假使他们家中还参加主要农业劳动的，应按其占有状况认为是中农或其他农民成份，若有其他职业者按其他职业决定成份。没有一定职业或丧失劳动力的应认为贫民，能劳动而不劳动的，或从事不正当职业的应认为游民。当伪军家里雇工问题，请参看本报五月十四号编读往来答建华同志。四、划阶级中计算富农的剥削收入时，工资和吃粮过高或过低是会影响其剥削收入的，遇到这些情况，应按具体情况精确计算该是什么就是什么。文件上规定的是指的一般情况。　　　　　　　　　　——编者
