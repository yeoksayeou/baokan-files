	◇ Because of its unique climate, no one had ever grown wheat in Manzhouli. Last year, after the democratic government mobilized the masses to successfully trial-plant wheat, this spring the municipal government lent out more than 80,000 catties of wheat and potato seeds, and also allocated more than 40 cattle and horses to farmers lacking livestock for free use. Last year, the city only had 72 wheat-growing households, but this year it has increased to 116.
	◇ The West Manchuria Railway Trade Union established the Nenjiang Livestock Cooperative, absorbing livestock experts to improve and breed superior livestock breeds. In addition to investing in and operating a farm of more than 100 hectares in the suburbs of the city, the Harbin Xingdong Oil Company has recently invested 100 million yuan to create a livestock farm, raising chickens, rabbits, and dairy cows, and plans to add sheep next year.
	◇ The Harbin Municipal Government organized the Fisheries Production Cooperative to support fishermen's production. The East Fujia, West Fujia, Xinyang, Songpu, and Guxiang districts have established branches. The Harbin branch of the Northeast Bank has provided low-interest fishing loans of 35 million yuan to approximately 1,000 fishing households. Fishermen in Songpu District organized 214 fishing boats of various sizes. In three days, they caught more than 4,000 catties of fish, making a profit of more than 10 million yuan.

　　东北生产拾零
    ◇满洲里因气候特殊，历来无人种麦，去年民主政府发动群众试种小麦成功后，今春市政府即贷放麦种土豆种八万余斤，并调剂牛马四十余匹，无代价借给缺乏牲口的农民使用。去年该市仅有种麦户七十二家，今年已增至一百十六家。
    ◇西满铁路总工会成立嫩江牧畜合作社，吸收畜牧专家改良与繁殖优良畜种。哈市兴东制油公司除已在市郊投资经营农场一百余垧外，近复投资一亿元，创造牧畜场，饲牧鸡兔乳牛，计划明年添加饲羊。
    ◇哈尔滨市政府组织渔业生产合作总社，扶助渔民生产，东傅家、西傅家、新阳、松浦、顾乡五区已成立分社。东北银行哈市分行已以低利渔贷三千五百万元，贷与渔民约千余户。松浦区渔民组织了二一四只大小渔船。三天中打渔四千余斤，获利千余万元。
