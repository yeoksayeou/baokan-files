Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 10th. A front-line reporter reports: On April 23rd, when the People's Liberation Army issued the order to launch a general attack on Weixian city, the good news of the recovery of Yan'an came, greatly inspiring every officer and soldier on the front line. A certain unit that captured the North Gate immediately used military democracy, carried out pre-battle assault military training, and reached a consensus on determination and unified methods through contract merit. The entire attacking force was full of confidence.

Weixian's city defenses had been built and transformed by the enemy, puppets, Chiang Kai-shek bandits for more than ten years. Stone and cement built a city wall four zhang high and more than one zhang thick. The top of the wall was equipped with four electric fences and a dense network of pillboxes. At each of the four corners of the city, there were towering high forts, which the enemy called "bird's nest" fortifications. Under the city wall, there were communication trenches, foxholes, minefields, and an earth wall more than one zhang high. Complex and solid mother-and-child pillboxes were built on and behind the earth wall facing the city gate. The moat around the city was two zhang wide and waist-deep, and outside the moat were barbed wire and chevaux-de-frise, forming semi-permanent, modern and solid fortifications. However, as soon as the attack began, the fierce artillery fire of our powerful artillery overwhelmed the enemy's firepower, destroying the predetermined targets one by one. The high pavilion standing on the North Gate was left with only half in the blink of an eye, the city wall stones burst and collapsed, and the enemy's fortifications and firepower were paralyzed.

Under the cover of artillery fire, the infantry swarming to attack the city carried out all actions bravely and skillfully according to the pre-war exercises, making rapid progress and suffering minimal casualties. A certain regiment carried out dozens of blasting operations, with only one blaster injured. After the 5th Company of the regiment entered the city, it boldly penetrated more than 100 meters into the depth, occupied more than ten houses in a row, and resisted more than 20 counterattacks by an enemy regiment. Finally, in the unfavorable situation where they had only two houses to defend, were surrounded by the enemy on three sides, and lost contact with the troops on the city wall, they still fought bravely until the follow-up troops arrived. The troops on the city wall held the breakthrough and fought fiercely with the enemy all night. Regiment Chief of Staff Ding Ya personally directed the battle on the city, repelling the enemy's repeated counterattacks and consolidating the gained position.

On the evening of the 24th, we completely captured the West City. On the evening of the 26th, our army continued to attack the East City. At 12:00 noon on the 27th, Weixian was completely captured. Chen Jincheng, commander of the enemy's 96th Division and commander of the 45th Division, and Zhang Tianzuo, commissioner and security commander of the puppet 8th District, led the remnants to flee southeast, but were completely annihilated by our outer troops just dozens of meters outside the city. The attacking troops raised a flag embroidered with "Plant the Victory Red Flag on Weixian City," which fluttered in the wind on the city.

    解放潍县经过
    【新华社华东前线十日电】前线记者报导：四月二十三日解放军下达向潍县城发动总攻的命令时又值收复延安的捷报传来，大大激奋了前线每个指战员。攻占北关之某部，立即运用军事民主，开展敌前突击军事学习，并通过合同立功，达到上下决心一致办法统一。整个攻城部队都信心百倍。
    潍县城防是经敌伪蒋匪十余年来历次修筑改造的。石块洋灰砌成了四丈高一丈多厚的城墙，墙顶设有四道电网和密布的子母堡群。城四角各有耸立的高堡，敌称之为鸟巢工事，城墙下挖有交通壕、散兵坑、地雷网及一丈多高的土墙。正对城门的土墙上及前后都修了复杂坚固的子母堡，环城壕宽达两丈，水深及腰，壕外又是铁丝网和鹿砦，构成了半永久性的近代化的坚固工事。但攻击一开始，我强大炮兵的猛烈炮火就压倒了敌人火力，将预定目标一一摧毁，北城门上矗立的高阁转眼只剩半截，城墙石块迸裂倾塌，敌人的工事和火力都瘫痪了。
    在炮兵掩护下蜂涌攻城的步兵，一切动作都英勇而熟练地按照战前演习的办法进行，进展迅速，伤亡极小。某团爆破数十次，仅一个爆破员负伤。该团五连打进城后，大胆插入纵深一百多米，连占十余幢房子，抗击敌一个团二十余次反扑，最后他们在只有两座房子可坚守而三面被敌包围又与城头部队失掉联系的恶劣情况下，仍英勇奋战直到后续部队来到。城头部队则坚守突破口与敌激战终夜，团参谋长丁亚亲自在城上指挥打退敌屡次反扑，巩固了既得阵地。
    二十四日黄昏，我全部攻克西城。二十六日黄昏我军继向东城攻击，二十七日午十二时，潍县即全告攻克。匪整九六军军长兼整四五师师长陈金城及伪八区专员兼保安司令张天佐等率残部向东南逃窜，仅出城数十米，即遭我外围部队全部歼灭，攻城部队举起了绣着“把胜利红旗插在潍县城上”的大旗，在城上迎风招展。
