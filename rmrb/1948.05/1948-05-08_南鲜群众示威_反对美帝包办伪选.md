Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 5th: South Korean people oppose the U.S. imperialist-orchestrated sham election scheduled for the 10th. According to a United Press report, on Jeju Island, separated from southern Korea by only a narrow strip of water, local people recently shot at reactionary elements involved in the South Korean sham election and other work, forcing several "election workers" to resign. At the end of last month, a mass demonstration of over a thousand people broke out in Seoul; demonstrators clashed with suppressing U.S. and South Korean military police in bloody conflicts; and they also surrounded government offices near the police station. The police chief of that city exclaimed on April 28th: "This is one of the most potentially dangerous incidents that has occurred in Seoul"; while admitting: "In the past, incidents against the police and right-wing leaders have also frequently occurred in South Korea." Fearing the "extremely widespread" (United Press language) anti-sham election movement of the South Korean people, Hodge, the commander of the U.S. military in South Korea, in addition to ordering on April 28th that all U.S. troops stationed in Korea implement "alert" from 6:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next morning from April 30th to May 3rd, also carried out intimidation, deception, and frantic violent suppression against the people. According to the United Press, from January 1st to April 26th, as many as 196 South Korean people were publicly shot and killed. The U.S. military authorities in South Korea have repeatedly issued statements threatening the people to participate in the sham election. Dean, the chairman of the South Korean military government, recently sent four trucks to Jeju to carry ballots and ballot boxes, forcing the people to vote.
