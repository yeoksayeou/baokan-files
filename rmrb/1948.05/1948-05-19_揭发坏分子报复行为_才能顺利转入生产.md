Exposing Saboteurs' Retaliatory Actions
  Only Then Can Production Proceed Smoothly
    Guo Fuzhai, the village head of Guomakou Village, First District, Fan County, Wang Fucai, the instructor and concurrent agricultural association chairman, and Guo Fuhai, the self-defense captain, felt uneasy and abandoned their leadership positions due to their poor style of seizing excessive fruits and their lack of understanding of the spirit of Party rectification. Village head Guo Fuzhai thought everything was ruined, and asked how he could govern the village! He was distressed and kept his head down for several months without saying a word. When others asked him, he said, "Anyway, I can't eat four plates (I won't live to see the new year)!" Instructor Wang Fucai said, "Now it's democracy! What can we say? Whatever people say is what it is!" expressing his dissatisfaction. Some former village cadres who had stepped down took this opportunity to tell the district cadres that the village cadres were so bad, attempting to struggle against the village cadres. However, the district cadres were not deceived by them. On the one hand, they actively called on the masses to produce, and on the other hand, according to the ideological situation of the village cadres, they explained the spirit of Party rectification to them, clearly stating that Party rectification was meant to remove our shortcomings and serve the people better! They also educated them to admit and correct their mistakes, and to actively lead production as the right path. They also took the example of Deputy Agricultural Association Chairman Guo Furen (of hired-laborer background, a poor peasant) and other three village cadres who were liked by the masses, using a comparative approach for education with living examples. At first, the village cadres did not believe it and could not turn their thinking around. After repeated individual talks by the district cadres and mobilization through village cadre meetings and branch meetings, and seeing that the district cadres were actively promoting production and that the masses did not want to oppose the village cadres, they slowly began to understand. Village head Guo Fuzhai said, "What else is there to say? I'm not afraid anymore!" Now he is very energetic in his work and does not slack off in field work, building houses, or mud houses. The masses said, "Fuzhai has never put in as much effort as he does now." Instructor Wang Fucai is also different from the past. He has changed his clothes, participates in mutual aid group activities, and voluntarily took out the two large jars of fruit and several pieces of clothing that he had over-occupied and no longer smokes foreign cigarettes. Village cadres who had good connections with the masses in the past became more active. Nong Huizhang Zhuo Caixuan (an old hired laborer) was elected as the director of the Production Committee in the village-wide democratic election of production committee members. Deputy Agricultural Association Chairman Guo Furen was also elected as a member. They are particularly enthusiastic about leading production.

　　揭发坏分子报复行为
  　才能顺利转入生产
    范县一区郭麻口村长郭福斋、指导员兼农会长王福才、自卫队长郭福海，由于多占果实作风不好，加以对整党精神不了解，苦闷不安放弃领导。村长郭福斋认为毁啦，治村干咧！一直苦恼，有几个月整天低着头不说话。别人问他，他说：“反正吃不了四个碟啦（过不了年的意思）！”指导员王福才说：“现在民主咧！咱能说啥？人家说啥就是啥吧！”表示不满。个别下台旧村干，这时向区干说：村干怎样怎样坏，企图斗争村干。可是区干不为他们所迷惑，一面积极号召群众生产，同时根据村干思想情况，向他们解释整党精神，明确说明整党是叫咱去掉毛病，更好的为人民服务咧！并教育他们知错改错，积极领导生产才是正路。又拿他村副农会长郭福忍（雇工出身是贫农）等三个为群众所喜欢的村干为例子，用对比的谈法以活样子进行教育。开始村干不相信，思想转不过来，经过区干和他们再三的个别谈话，又开了村干会支部会进行动员。同时他们看到区干积极推动生产，群众也并不是要反村干，慢慢想开了。村长郭福斋说：“那还说啥？我不怕啦！”现在他在工作中可带劲啦，做地里活、盖房子、泥房子都不偷懒。群众说：“福斋啥时候也没有这时出的力大。”指导员王福才也不同过去啦，穿的也换了，也参加互助组的活，把自己多占的果实两个大缸，几件衣服，自动拿出来，也不吸洋烟啦。过去和群众联系好的村干部更积极了，农会长卓才选（老雇工）在全村民主选举生产委员时当选为生产委员会主任。副农会长郭福忍也当选为委员，他们领导生产的劲头特别大。
