(Taiyue News) Because the Yicheng County Committee proposed not to publicly publicize and compensate the losses of middle peasants, many cadres did not carry out corrections, and the infringement of middle peasants continued to develop with bias. Recently, Nanshi Village set wages into three classes: poor peasants and hired laborers, 3 *sheng* of rice per work unit; middle peasants, 2 *sheng*; landlords, 1 *sheng*. In Heshui Village, someone wanted to exchange good land with middle peasants. In Macesha Village, people wanted to kill and eat the two pigs of middle peasants. The poor peasant and hired laborer group in Beiguan replaced the village government in handling everything. The doors that had been sealed were not opened. For example, in Wu Chi, the doors of middle peasants that were sealed were not opened, but empty propaganda was still being carried out about uniting with middle peasants. The middle peasants said, "The policy is good, but I'm afraid it won't reach the bottom." Or they said, "When it comes time to harvest what someone else plants, and they don't let you harvest, what can you do?" Some people sowed seeds without plowing the land. They said, "After this season's harvest, who knows who the land will belong to next season?" This kind of evil consequence was caused by the Yicheng County Committee's failure to implement the Central Bureau's instructions.

    翼城有些村照旧蛮干
    工资还是分三等
    【太岳消息】翼城因为县委提出不公开宣传与补偿中农损失，不少干部就不进行纠正，侵犯中农偏向继续发展。南史庄最近把工资订为三种：贫雇每工三升米，中农二升，地主一升。贺水村有人要跟中农换好地，马册村要杀吃中农的两口猪，北关贫雇组代替村政权处理一切。封了门的也没有开门。如武池封了中农的门就没开，可是还空头宣传要团结中农，中农说：“政策好是好，恐怕到不了底。”或说：“谁种谁收到那时不叫你收，你能怎么样？”有些人不犁地就下种了。他们说：“这一季收了下一季还不知道地要变成谁的？”这种恶果是翼城县委不执行中央局指示所造成的。
