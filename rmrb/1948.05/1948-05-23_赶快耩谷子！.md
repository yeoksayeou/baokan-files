　　Hurry and Plant Millet!
    "Little Fullness for millet, Summer Solstice for flowers." Now is the time to plant millet. Since the beginning of spring this year, the rainfall has been even, and the soil is very good. Crops planted at this time will surely grow full and lush. No one should let go of this opportunity. Planting autumn crops gives us peace of mind, and there is hope for a bumper harvest in the autumn. Only when everyone plants crops can we ensure that everyone has food to eat. This is a big deal. Cadres in each village should lead the masses well, encourage voluntary cooperation, and ensure equal exchange so that no one suffers a loss or gains an advantage. Organize mutual aid and labor exchange to improve production. Furthermore, you should check if the poor households, wrongly labeled middle peasants, landlords, and rich peasants in your village have planted crops. If not, you should immediately find ways to solve their difficulties and not ignore them. In areas where crops have already been planted, and the seedlings have emerged, quickly organize all available labor to weed. Don't delay. If the seedlings are crowded together with wheat stubble, you will be overwhelmed and easily neglect the crops.

### 赶快耩谷子！

　　赶快耩谷子！
    “小满谷子立夏花”。现在正是种应时谷子的时候，今年入春以来，雨水调匀，垧土很好，这时种的庄稼，一定长得满苗满垅，谁家也不要松手，把机会放过。秋庄稼种上了，就吃下定心丸，秋天就有五谷丰登的希望。只有大家都种上庄稼，才能保证大家都有饭吃。这是件大事情，各村干部同志，好好领导群众，自愿结合，等价交换，谁也不吃亏沾光，组织互助拨工，把生产搞好。更要检查一下，你村的贫户、错斗的中农、地主富农种上了没有？如果没有，就应该马上想办法，解决他们的困难，不能不管。已经种上庄稼的地方，小苗出来了，就赶快组织大小劳力锄苗，不能拖拖拉拉。要是和麦茬苗挤到一块，就会忙不开，容易荒了苗子。
