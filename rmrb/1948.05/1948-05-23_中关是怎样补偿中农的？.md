　　How Zhongguan Compensates Middle Peasants
　　Wang Xing, Cao Sanlu, Guo Lianbi
　　[Shahe News] Zhongguan Village in the Fourth District of Shahe is a village undergoing land reform. Last winter, when organizing the poor and hired peasants, the interests of the middle peasants were seriously infringed upon. The most important of these was during the winter production campaign last winter when the district instructed and called on middle peasants to invest in the establishment of credit cooperatives to help the poor and hired peasants. Slogans were put forward such as: "Turn dead assets into living assets, find ways for production." "Grasp the big and look at the small, seize opportunities for profit." "Eight Immortals cross the sea, each showing their unique abilities." "See who can seek benefits for the poor and hired peasants." Village cadres (listening to the district and county) accepted a lot of leftist ideas that were purely for the service of the poor and hired peasants, and completely threw the unity of the middle peasants to the back of their minds. Upon returning to the village, they actively called on the middle peasants to invest. Because no one invested, and hearing that other villages had borrowed things from middle peasants and already started, the cadres became even more flustered and decided to assign the amount of shares to be purchased based on the height of the family's "earth mound," forcibly apportioning funds. Wealthy middle peasant Huo Zhenxing was assigned 50,000 yuan. Unable to produce it, he sold an ox, saying, "This is impossible to live with. Whoever is taller will be pulled down." Middle peasant Huo Wenjing was assigned 40,000 yuan and sold seven or eight trees of various sizes. Middle peasant Huo Shouchang was also forced to sell seven trees and two bags of grain, and Huo Haichuan sold an ox. Some households were unwilling to sell, and the cadres and members of the "Poor and Hired Peasants Group" said, "Trees are dead objects, why not sell them?" Even the six new middle peasant households in the "Poor and Hired Peasants Group" were assigned shares. New middle peasant Huo Guangxin had two oxen, and another one was born. When apportioning the funds, they said, "Guangxin has three oxen, he must pay." After taking out the funds, Guangxin complained to his ox, saying, "This ox is really useless, and it just had to give birth to a calf!" Huo Shanlin said after being assigned 30,000 yuan, "What's the point of saving and producing?" The village collectively assigned one rich peasant household, 50,000 yuan; sixteen middle peasant households, 380,000 yuan; and six new middle peasant households, 41,000 yuan. As a result of this serious infringement on the interests of the middle peasants, widespread non-production and waste were formed. Some middle peasants said, "This is just a small movement."

　　After the "Poor and Hired Peasants Group" officially took power, they simply overturned the Party members' plan to establish credit cooperatives, and divided the assigned funds and the more than 250,000 yuan of funds stored in the farmers' association to fill the holes. 52,500 yuan was distributed to three middle peasant households; 514,000 yuan to twenty-one new middle peasant households; and 161,000 yuan to three poor peasant households (part of which was from the farmers' association funds). After this distribution, most of it was used properly, and nine livestock were purchased. However, some households that received less money wasted it, especially since it was around the time of the New Year.

　　The work team learned about this serious situation of harming the middle peasants and, after research, decided to correct it appropriately. The guiding ideology was first clarified: Although most of the funds were used properly, assigning funds to the middle peasants was a fundamental error and must be resolutely returned in full. The error must not be continued. Subsequently, a meeting of Party members and farmers' representatives was convened to discuss and clarify the understanding of this error. It was unanimously felt that it would not be possible to stabilize the middle peasants if empty words were said without actual correction. Xing Haiyun, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, and the head of the cooperative, each received 10,000 yuan, and they were the first to report and return the money. Haiyun said, "At the time of the assignment, I felt that it was for the poor and hired peasants. Now, in retrospect, I made a big mistake. Even if it is returned now, the middle peasants are still suffering. How much could you buy with this money at that time, and how much can you buy now?" Around the ninth, a meeting of the households that received funds was convened again. After four or five nights of debate, coupled with explanations from the leadership, the ideological understanding was clarified. Huo Cao said, "We haven't turned ourselves around yet, so we can't turn ourselves around on the middle peasants. They didn't exploit us, and the middle and poor peasants are one family, I resolutely return it." Huo Zhifeng said, "I received 10,000 yuan, in addition to returning the principal, I will also pay interest, we are one family." Everyone agreed: "It's not enough for us to just say we were wrong, we have to actually return it to them." Some poor peasants who received a lot of money couldn't afford to return it and said, "I will even sell the livestock I bought this time to return it." Everyone agreed to return it resolutely. Finally, the method of return was stipulated: (1) Households that can afford to return it should return it immediately. (2) Households that have turned themselves around, but cannot afford it now, can take out a loan from the credit cooperative to return it. (3) For households that have not been thoroughly turned around, in order to prevent them from selling their property, the farmers' association will lend them money (without interest), which will be resolved when it is equally distributed in the future. From the date of distribution, interest will be given at two percent per month. Everyone said, "We can't use it for nothing." A few households (that received a lot of money) resisted ideologically, but the leadership did not waver at all and resolutely educated and corrected them. At the same time, a meeting of the households that were assigned funds was also convened to solicit their opinions. Yuan Youlin said, "We couldn't even participate in the farmers' association before. This time, we were assigned funds and they are going to be returned to us, and without interest! Our village has increased several livestock, and in the future, the middle peasants will have less corvee labor to support." Huo Shouchang said, "We middle and poor peasants are one family, just return the principal." Huo Tongxi said, "Some households can't afford to return it, it's not too late to return it when the wheat comes down in May. Just for this, we can't let them sell grain and things, we can't let the poor peasants go hungry." After both sides cleared their minds, especially emphasizing that the middle and poor peasants are one family, and promoting the spirit of mutual unity. After several days of preparation, on the fourteenth, the middle peasants' money was returned in full according to the above three methods, and interest was given at a monthly rate of two percent. After this correction, the middle peasants all said, "This is really not touching the middle peasants!" Huo Shouchang said, "After I was assigned the funds, I immediately stopped production. I took my furniture to the field, threw it aside and just rested. My neighbors were producing, and I even disrupted their production. From now on, I will have to produce well." By this point, in addition to actively producing, within a few days, five bad livestock were exchanged for good livestock, and one was added. And soon, mutual aid teams will be organized and consolidated to better carry out production.

　　Our experience after correcting the deviation in this village is: (1) As long as the interests of the middle peasants are infringed upon, even if it is used properly, it must be resolutely returned or compensated, so that the middle peasants can be truly united. (2) The class education that runs through the middle and poor peasants as one family, clears the minds of both sides, so that after returning the losses to the middle peasants, it does not hit the emotions of the poor peasants. (3) In correcting the deviation, the leadership ideology must not be shaken due to the dissatisfaction of a few individuals.

　　(Editor's Note: When returning or compensating the middle peasants, some poor peasants have great difficulties and cannot afford to take it out. The farmers' association should think of more ways, such as borrowing money or other remedies. This village has done a very good job in this respect.)

　　中关是怎样补偿中农的？
    王兴　曹三禄　郭连璧
    【沙河消息】沙河四区中关村是土改村。去冬组织贫雇时，严重的侵犯了中农利益。其中最主要的，是去冬搞冬季生产时，区里布置号召中农入股，成立信用社，帮助贫雇。并提出口号：“死物变活物，生产找门路。”“抓大看小，见利就找”。“八仙过海，各显身手”。“看谁能给贫雇谋利益”。（区听的县的）村干部便接受了一肚子单纯为贫雇服务的左倾思想，把团结中农全部扔在脑后。回村便积极号召中农入股。因没人入，又听到别村借中农东西，已经搞起来，干部更着了慌，决定根据家庭圪堆高低，分别分配入股数目，强迫派款。富裕中农霍振兴被派五万元，拿不出，卖牛一头，说：“这怎也不能过了，谁高了就要拉谁的。”中农霍文景被派四万元，卖大小树七、八棵。中农霍守成也被逼的卖树七棵，卖粮食两布袋，霍海川卖牛一头。有的户不愿卖，干部及“贫雇团”的人便说：“树是死物，为啥不卖？”甚至“贫雇团”里的六户新中农，也被派了。新中农霍广心有牛两头，又下一头，派款时说：“广心有牛三头，可得拿的。”拿出款后，广心埋怨他的牛说：“这牛真不争气，偏偏又下了个小牛！”霍山林被派三万元后说：“这还生产省俭干啥？”全村共派富农一户，五万元，中农十六户，三十八万元，新中农六户，四万一千元。由于这样严重侵犯了中农利益，结果形成了普遍的不生产，浪费。有的中农说：“这就是个小运动。”
    “贫雇团”正式掌权后，便干脆把党员搞信用社的计划推翻，把派的款及农会中存的二十五万余元款，一同分了，填了窟窿。分给中农三户，五万二千五百元；新中农二十一户，五十一万四千元；贫农三户，十六万一千元（有一部分是农会款）。这样分了后，大部分用的还正当，增买牲口九头。但有些分款较少的户，正在过年时候，也就浪费了。
    工作组了解到这种损害中农的严重情况，经过研究，决心适当纠正。领导思想首先明确了：虽说大部款子用的正当，但派中农款是犯了原则错误，必须坚决全数退还。决不能仍错误下去。随即召开党员及农代会研究讨论，明确认识了这一错误，一致感到光说空话，不加实际纠正，是安定不了中农的。武委会主任邢海云与合作社长二人，也各分了一万元，他们首先自报退还。海云说：“在派时我还觉得是为贫雇的，现在检讨，实在大大的犯了错误。现在就是退回，中农也吃着亏。那时拿这些钱得多少东西卖，这时才能买多少？”九号前后又召开了分款户会议。经四、五夜争论，再加上领导上的解释，思想才弄通。霍曹的说：“咱没翻好身，也不能在中农身上翻呀。人家又没剥削咱，中贫农是一家人呀，我坚决退还。”霍治凤说：“我分了一万元，除退还本钱，我还出利的，是一家人哩。”大家一致认为：“咱光说错了，不实际还人家可不行。”有些贫农分的款多，还不起，说：“我就是卖了我这次买的那头牲口也要还。”都同意坚决退。最后规定退的办法：（一）能还起的户马上就还。（二）已翻身户，但现在拿不起的，可到信用社贷款还。（三）没翻透的户，为使其不卖家产，由农会借给款（不出利），等将来平分时再解决。自分款日起，每月按二分给利。大家说：“不能白用。”有个别户（分钱多的）思想抵抗，领导上毫没动摇，坚决教育纠正。同时也召开了被派款户会议，征求他们意见。袁有林说：“以前咱连农会也不能参加，这次派了款还要退给咱，可不用出利！咱村增加了好几头牲口，往后中农也能少支差了。”霍首成说：“咱中贫农是一家人哩，光还了本算了吧。”霍同喜说：“有些户还不起，到五月麦子下来还也不迟。光为这，可不能叫他们卖粮食、东西，不能叫贫农饿起来呀。”经这样双方打通思想，特别强调中贫农是一家，发扬了相互团结的精神。经数天准备，十四号便照以上三种办法将中农的钱原数退还，并按月利二分给了利息。经这样纠正后，中农都说：“这可真是不动中农呀！”霍首成说：“派了我款后，我马上就不生产了，拿上家具到地，扔到一边光去歇着。俺邻家们生产，我还破坏人家，这往后可要好好生产哩。”至此，全村除积极生产外，数天内，坏牲口换好牲口五头，增加的一头。并马上要组织整顿互助组，更好的进行生产。
    经过该村纠偏，我们的体会是：（一）只要侵犯了中农利益，就是用得正当，也得坚决退还或补偿，这样才能真正团结了中农。（二）贯穿中贫农一家的阶级教育，双方打通思想，使退还中农损失后，不致打击了贫农情绪。（三）纠偏中决不能因有个别人不满而动摇领导思想。
    （编者意见：在退还或补偿中农时，有些贫农很困难，拿不出来，农会应该想更多的办法，如借钱，或其他补救办法。该村这一点是做得很好的。）
