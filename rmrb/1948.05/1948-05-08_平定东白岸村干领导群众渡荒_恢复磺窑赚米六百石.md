[Pingding News] East Baian Village in Pingding is one of the most severely drought-stricken villages in the area. Two years ago, it was completely looted by the Yan puppet regime, and last year's tax collection led to consecutive years of famine. Last year's harvest averaged less than three dou of coarse grains per person, which, according to the minimum living standard, was only enough to eat for just over two months. After the autumn harvest, most of the masses had nothing to eat and could not find a way out of their livelihood difficulties. Village cadres, based on the village's traditional reliance on sulfur kilns as a major source of livelihood, mobilized the masses to dig for sulfur. However, the masses were not very enthusiastic, fearing a lack of sales outlets. The masses said, "To fully mobilize and solve our village's famine, we must develop iron smelting furnaces." Based on the demands of the masses, the cadres borrowed 40 shi of grain and 5 million yuan from the government, lending these grains and funds to the most impoverished laborers and households without labor power as capital to establish two smelting furnaces.

To ensure the success of the smelting furnaces, the cadres assigned specific tasks based on each cadre's technical skills and mobilized and organized the masses to mine various colored materials. Each leader oversaw a type of production (coal, gangue, sulfur, charcoal, transportation). The village chief, militia instructor, and trade union chairman led the work at the furnace. The charcoal kiln was managed by the trade union chairman, the gangue kiln by the production committee member, the coal smoking by the staff member in charge of workers, the charcoal transportation by the peasant association chairman, and the sulfur kiln by the Party branch secretary and other cadres. Women's transportation was managed by the women's secretary, and children's transportation by the teacher. The cadres personally participated in the work, resolving the workers' ideological and practical problems at any time. Workers found partners for mutual assistance on their own, forming groups of three to five. Each kiln formed a mutual aid group, led jointly by the group leader and the participating cadres. In terms of profit sharing, after deducting the expenses of the kiln, profits were distributed based on the number of days worked. A slogan was put forward to ensure that the furnace never lacked five-colored materials.

At first, the women thought that they could not carry loads, that they were not capable, and that they were shy. Because wages were not paid promptly, they were unwilling to carry. The cadres guaranteed daily wage payments, and the women's vice-secretary personally took the lead, mobilizing several women to carry a few times. Slowly, they were no longer shy. The profit-sharing method was generally half for public use and half for private use. For example, if the vice-secretary had three sisters-in-law in her family, two carried sulfur every day, and one cooked at home. The money earned was divided, with half going to the family and the other half divided equally among the three. Jia Lianfang and Jia Meifang, two sisters-in-law, one regularly carried sulfur, and the other spun and cooked at home. The money earned from carrying sulfur and spinning was also divided according to the above method. This motivated all the able-bodied women in the village. They carried sulfur in the morning and forenoon and spun in the afternoon. Some women carried 80 or 90 jin per trip, and even women with bound feet combined spinning with mutual aid to carry sulfur.

Children combined studying with carrying sulfur. In addition to covering the cost of their own books and stationery, they earned a lot of rice.

From the second half of the eleventh lunar month of last year until now, after four months of operating the smelting furnaces, the two furnaces, after deducting expenses, earned a net profit of 64 shi of millet. The 31 impoverished laborers and households without labor power were allocated shares, with the most receiving more than four shi and the least receiving more than one shi. This solved half a year's worth of food for households without labor power. The 101 draft animals and 52 people transporting charcoal and iron earned 2.5 million yuan and 69 shi of millet. The 85 men and women carrying sulfur earned 8 shi and 3 dou of rice and 625,000 yuan. The 72 workers in the coal, gangue, sulfur, and charcoal kilns earned 58 shi and 2 dou of rice and 1.08 million yuan. The remaining workers transporting iron, furnace workers, small merchants carrying loads, carpenters, and small lime burners all earned a considerable amount of money and grain. The 136 women who spun earned 135,000 yuan. The 93 Wuxiang workers also earned more than 6 million yuan. In total, they earned 226 shi of rice and 11 million yuan. Converted to rice at 30,000 yuan per shi, this is equivalent to 374 shi, totaling 600 shi, solving one-third of the village's annual grain shortage. The village is now combining agriculture and sideline production, digging sulfur and gangue, carrying, and transporting in the morning and forenoon, and working in the fields in the afternoon. Sowing has already begun. (Pingding Construction Section Communication Group)

　　平定东白岸村干领导群众渡荒
  　恢复磺窑赚米六百石
    【平定消息】平定东白岸村是一区灾荒最严重的一个村。前年阎伪抢劫一空，去年款收，造成连年灾荒。去年收成每人平均不足三斗杂粮，按最低生活标准，只能吃两个多月。秋收以后大部群众就没吃的，也找不到生活出路。村干部根据本村历来就以磺窑为主要生活来源，即发动群众刨磺。但群众怕没销路，劲头不大。群众说：“要想全面动起来解决咱村的灾荒，只有开展生铁炉才行。”干部依照群众要求，就向政府贷粮四十石，贷款五十万元，把这些粮款贷给最困难的贫雇与无劳力户，作为资本，开办了两座生炉。
    干部们为了把生炉干好，就根据每个干部的技术具体分工，发动与组织群众开采五色材料。各领导一类生产（煤、矸、磺、炭、运输）。村长、民兵指导员、工会主席等领导炉上。炭窑有工会主席，矸窑有生产委员，熏煤有职工干事，驮炭有农会主席，磺窑有支书及其他干部，妇女运输有妇女秘书，儿童运输有教员。干部都亲自参加作工，随时解决工人的思想和实际问题。工人互助是自己找对心事人，三三五五结合起来。以一个窑为单位结一成个互助组，设组长，和参加的干部共同领导。在分红上，除窑上开支外，按天数分红。并提出口号，保证炉上不能缺了五色材料使用。
    妇女们起先认为自己不能担挑、不行、害羞，又不能及时开支，都不愿担。干部保证一天一开支，妇女副秘书又亲自带头，动员了几个先担了几回，慢慢都不害羞了。分红办法：一般都是公私各半分红。如副秘书家里妯娌三个，每天有两个担磺，一个在家做饭，赚回的工钱除分给家一半外，三个人平均分开。贾联芳、贾美芳妯娌二个，一个经常担磺，一个在家纺织做饭。担磺纺织所赚的钱，也依上述办法分红。这样推动了全村有劳力的妇女。早晨和上午担磺，下午纺花。有的妇女一趟担八、九十斤，甚至小脚妇女也有结合纺织互助抬磺的。
    儿童是念书担磺结合。除解决了自己的书籍文具费用外，还赚米很多。
    从去年阴历十一月后半月开展生炉，到现在四个月，两座生炉除开支外，净赚小米六十四石，三十一户无劳力贫雇按股分下去，最多的分到四石多，最少的分到一石多。这样给无劳力户解决了半年的吃用。运输炭、铁牲口一百零一头，五十二个人，赚洋二百五十万元，小米六十九石。男女担磺人数八十五个，赚米八石三斗，洋六十二万五。煤、矸、磺、炭窑工人七十二个，赚米五十八石二，洋一百零八万元。其余担运铁的、炉厂工人、担挑小商、木匠工人、烧小灰的，都赚钱赚粮不少。纺织妇女一百三十六个，赚洋十三万五千元。武乡工人九十三个，也赚洋六百余万元。总计赚米二百二十六石，洋一千一百余万元。以三万元一石折米，可折三百七十四石，共六百石，解决了全村全年缺粮的三分之一。现在该村正以农副结合，早晨、上午刨磺、矸、担、运输，下午上地，目下已开始下种。（平定建设科通讯小组）
