Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th—After months of effort by the Party, government, army, and people, a million disaster victims have successfully weathered the spring famine. However, with the new wheat harvest still half a month away, East China is vigorously promoting mutual aid to overcome food shortages and prepare for the summer harvest. The Yiyuan County (newly established) County Party Committee in Luzhong dispatched more than 20 cadres on the 14th to Zhangzhuang, Huangzhuang, and Qinglong districts to inspect the disaster situation and provide emergency relief. They also organized the masses to overcome complacency and procrastination, urging them to seize the time for summer plowing and weeding. The disaster situation in Zhuting County (formerly Ganyu) is more severe, with the number of disaster victims in the Xinhai and Luyang districts reaching over 20,000. The Binhai District Production and Disaster Relief Committee is organizing mutual aid among the counties. Currently, Junan (newly established) has raised 500,000 catties of sweet potato seedlings to send for emergency relief. The number of disaster victims in the Fifth District of Cangshan has also increased. The masses in the district have adjusted and donated over 7,000 catties of grain from the fruits of their struggles, and the government has also provided emergency relief of over 58,000 catties, ensuring that the district's disaster victims have enough food before the wheat harvest. Disaster victims in Guanyun County in the Subei Huaihai District have been rescued with 120,000 catties of grain allocated by the Production and Disaster Relief Committee, ensuring that all disaster victims in the county can overcome the famine. The CCP Committee, Military Region, Administrative Office, and other organs in Jiaodong, as well as the CCP Prefectural Committee, Commissioner's Office, and Bureau of Industry and Commerce in the Xihai Sub-district, saved over 25,000 catties of grain and over 10 million yuan in food funds to provide emergency relief to disaster-stricken areas such as Pingdu, Changan, Hebei, and Weinan (all newly established counties). The Changan County Party Committee also organized a work team with 60,000 catties of emergency relief grain to provide assistance to the Huangqi District (newly liberated area). Furthermore, the Beihai Bank has decided to lend 2.7 million catties of soybean seeds to solve the difficulty of soybean seeds for the masses in the Lunan District after the wheat harvest.
