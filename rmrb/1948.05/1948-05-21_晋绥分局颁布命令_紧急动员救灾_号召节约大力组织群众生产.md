Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 19th: Although vigorous disaster relief efforts have been undertaken here, due to widespread natural disasters last year, and especially the insane looting by Chiang, Yen, and Fu bandits, the disaster situation remains extremely serious. The Jin-Sui Branch Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party has therefore issued an "Emergency Mobilization Order for Disaster Relief and Saving Lives," ordering Party committees, governments at all levels, work groups, representative conferences, farmers' associations, and organs and troops at all levels to take immediate action: (1) With a high degree of responsibility to the people, attach importance to disaster relief and saving lives during the current period, resolutely oppose bureaucratic styles of work. Responsible comrades in disaster areas should personally go to areas with severe disaster situations to conduct inspections. Border areas should pay even more attention to organizing forces to resolutely strike against enemies who invade and loot grain. (2) Actively promote and develop the spirit of class love and mutual assistance, and concretely organize mutual aid of grain and grass between counties and counties, districts and districts, villages and villages, and mutual borrowing between households and households, and people and people, on a voluntary basis. Representative conferences can be responsible for issuing receipts to guarantee repayment. Under the leadership of representative conferences and farmers' associations, launch a mass mutual aid and mutual borrowing movement. (3) Rapidly check the distribution results of grain loans and relief grain, recover and redistribute those improperly distributed, strictly prevent bad people from stealing from them, and promptly distribute those not yet fully distributed. Oppose equal distribution, and implement a system of quantitative rations according to the actual needs of disaster victims when necessary. (4) Local industrial and commercial bureaus and cooperatives should send people with grain, funds, and cotton to disaster areas to organize mass sideline production, first lending capital and wages, and then systematically purchasing mass sideline products, and providing concrete solutions to the tool and technical difficulties in sideline production. (5) First, concentrate all efforts in severely affected areas to ensure that people do not starve to death, that fewer people starve to death, and that the phenomenon of continued fleeing from famine is stopped. Stop the slaughter of livestock to prevent production from stagnating, so that those who have not sown can sow quickly, and those who have sown will not be abandoned. (6) In addition to actively carrying out work in accordance with the above methods, organs, troops, and organizations in the border area should simultaneously call for thrift, oppose waste, and carry out public and private mass donations to rescue lives.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 19th: Amidst the urgent disaster relief and life-saving efforts in various parts of Jin-Sui, leadership in production is being strengthened and the spirit of mutual assistance is being promoted. In Anziping Village, Jingle County, and other villages, no land is left uncultivated. Zhang Huangda, a member of the farmers' association, arranged for people in the village who were not good at working or farming to join various work-exchange teams according to the principle of voluntarism, giving full play to everyone's strength, and paired up cattle and donkeys without delaying the delivery of manure and plowing. The Fifth Administrative Village in the Seventh District of Daixian County resolutely implemented the policy of targeted grain loans. Village representatives personally visited various natural villages to conduct investigations and directly loaned to grain-deficient households. For those who were not good at labor among grain-deficient households, the grain loans were entrusted to the representatives of the natural villages for safekeeping and distributed during labor. The village has solved the food difficulties of poor farmers. In Hejia Village and other villages in the Third District of Xing County, the disaster was most severe. After two months of mobilizing the masses to boil saltpeter, spin, pick wild vegetables, gather tree leaves, and transport goods for self-help and self-sufficiency, they can now solve more than a month's worth of food. All of the district's more than 10,000 hectares of summer fields have been sown. Farmers in Dagou and Mafang villages in Shenchi County donated more than 200 dan of grain (260 catties per dan). Zhao Haicheng's donation of grain solved the food problem for twelve households and was commended by the district representative conference. Farmers in Leishang Village and other villages in the First District of Hongdong and Zhaocheng counties donated 60 dan of fruit grain in one instance. The disaster situation in Chaijiacha and other villages in Lin County is very serious. The masses in the entire district are practicing mutual assistance. Eight administrative villages, including Qiaojiacha, donated 69 dan of fruit grain and put forward the slogan of striving to prevent anyone in the entire district from starving to death. In Palougou in the Third District of Baode County, more than 50 dan of spring famine grain stored last year was handed over to the district farmers' association for unified distribution.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 19th: While engaged in intense combat and training, a unit of the People's Liberation Army set aside some personnel to help farmers in Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and Linxi counties rush to repair the Tongli Canal, allowing the canal to irrigate the fields twenty days ahead of schedule and saving 1,492 dan of wages in grain (300 catties per dan). Under the command of the local water conservancy committee, the unit, from the commanders down to the cooks, actively participated, and the labor efficiency exceeded the planned target by two or three times. One unit built a section of the canal entrance, where strange rocks were densely packed and spring water surged. The soldiers still dug and chiseled in the cold muddy water, and in a few days, they built a canal more than 1,530 zhang long, 2.2 zhang wide, and 5 chi deep. A certain platoon got up at three o'clock in the dark to start work, and two squads of a certain team worked continuously for fifteen hours, completing three days of work. The unit strictly observed various regulations, such as not eating the food of the masses, not damaging green seedlings when digging soil, not stepping on fields of grain when resting, and compensating for damaged tools. The masses were all moved by the troops' spirit of serving the people.
