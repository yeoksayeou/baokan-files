　　Seizing the Kaojia River Position
　　Min Sha
　　A battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's 17th New Brigade was firmly entrenched in the Kaojia River position south of Songhe Town in Jingshan, with strong firepower and solid fortifications. After receiving the task of capturing this position, the 3rd Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, the instructor said to the soldiers: "We have all undergone military consolidation, and only by fighting well can we say we have consolidated well. Failure to take this enemy position means we haven't achieved good results." To the new soldiers newly liberated from Sanyangdian who had not participated in the military consolidation study, he said: "You haven't studied yet, so this counts as your first lesson."
　　The battle began. In the first attack, machine gunner Jiao Yimin was wounded. The instructor told him to go down to rest, but Jiao said, "No, I still want to provide cover." The wounded Second Squad Leader Li Qunsheng took several soldiers and crawled outside the enemy's outer defenses, waiting for the second attack to charge up again. Guo Gancheng, a private first class from the Second Company of the First Regiment of the newly reorganized 17th New Brigade, participated in both attacks. He only recognized the platoon deputy, so he always sought contact with the platoon deputy, saying, "Platoon Deputy: I'm not going down. We'll take it down in a little while."
　　Deputy Company Commander Hu Xingyou organized the third attack. The soldiers were all eagerly urging, "Attack quickly, or the enemy will run away." At this time, the Fourth Squad Deputy, with a machine gun in his left hand and a grenade in his right, charged up with the assault squad. The wounded who could crawl also followed. They entered the outer defenses, seized the enemy's firmly held position, and surrounded the fleeing remnants.
　　During the rest, the instructor smiled and said: "The military consolidation was really not bad."

　　夺取靠家河阵地
    民沙
    蒋匪新十七旅一个营固守在京山宋河镇南面的靠家河阵地，火力很强，工事坚固。解放军某部第三连接受夺取这个阵地的任务后，指导员对战士说：“我们都是整过军的，要打的好才算整的好，拿不下敌人这个阵地就算不得好成绩。”对未参加过整军学习，刚从三阳店解放的新战士们，则说：“你们没学习过，这就算是第一课。”
    战斗打响。第一次攻击中机枪手焦益民负了伤，指导员叫他下去休息，焦说：“不，我还要打掩护”。负伤的二班长李群生带着几个战士爬在敌人的大城外不下来，等第二次攻击时，又冲了上去。才解放不久的新十七旅一团二连上等兵郭干城两次攻击都参加了，他还只认得排副，所以总找排副联络，他说：“排副：我不下去，一会就要把它打下来。”
    副连长胡兴友组织了第三次攻击。战士们都急的催促着：“快点攻吧，等一下敌人要跑的。”这时四班副左手提机枪，右手拿炸弹和突击班一齐攻上去，负伤的能爬动着的都一起随着冲，进了大城，夺取了敌人固守的阵地，并包围了跑出的残敌。
    在休息时，指导员微笑着说：整军真整的不差。
