　　Our Army's Victorious Offensive in the Central Section of the Jiaoji Railway Continues to Expand
	Successively Capturing Changle and Anqiu
	More Than 1,000 Soldiers of the Chiang Army's Weixian Self-Defense Force Revolt
	Our Army in the Central Plains Recaptures Runan County
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huadong Front, 4th] After the liberation army captured Weixian city, it took advantage of the victory to expand the results of the battle. At 6:00 PM on April 29th, it recovered Anqiu city. The defending bandits abandoned the city and fled south. Our army immediately dispatched teams to track and pursue them. On May 1st, it annihilated the defending bandits in Changle and liberated the city. On the same day, another unit liberated Hanting Town, more than 20 li northeast of Weixian. Most of the defending bandits were annihilated, and a few remaining bandits broke through and fled south. We are currently encircling and attacking them.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huadong Front, 4th] The entire "People's Self-Defense" General Team of the Chiang Army in Weixian, consisting of two large detachments and thirteen platoons, totaling more than 1,500 people, led by Deputy Commander Fan Qi＠, revolted at Yujiazhuang, more than 20 li south of Changle, on April 28th. They announced their withdrawal from the criminal camp of the Chiang bandits and vowed to serve the people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The entire team arrived at a certain location in the liberated area at noon on the same day.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 4th] On the morning of the 1st, the Liberation Army recaptured Runan County. The defending bandits fled in panic, and we are pursuing them.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 4th] In mid-March, a certain detachment of the 3rd Sub-district's local armed forces entered the area north of the Luo River to mobilize the masses to suppress bandits. In 26 days, with minimal casualties, they completely annihilated or largely eliminated major bandit gangs in the area, totaling more than 1,700 people. The battles of Zhongshan and Shiwang Village both achieved the brilliant record of 1:120. They also recovered Luoning County and important towns such as Zhongshan and Changshui, consolidated the Luonan liberated area, and initially opened up the situation in northern Luoyang. In suppressing bandits, the detachment fully demonstrated its fighting style of disregarding fatigue, continuous operations, long-distance raids, and fierce pursuit, and implemented the correct policy towards prisoners. Those who were coerced were immediately released, while those who volunteered to join our army were given a grievance education. As a result, Zhou Jianzhong and Liu Qian, who had only been in the army for 20 days after liberation, made great contributions in their first battle at Shiwang Village. Under difficult operating conditions, the detachment consistently maintained strict discipline and implemented the policy of relying on the people to eliminate bandit disasters, closely combining military suppression with political suppression. Recently, the military region issued a commendation order to the detachment.
