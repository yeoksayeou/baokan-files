(Taiyue News) According to a letter from our comrade He Wei in Yicheng, the Yicheng County Committee proposed that compensation for the losses of middle peasants should not be publicized, but rather cadres should simply pay attention to it when handling problems. A few days ago, Li Qi of the Yicheng County Committee wrote to the Second District Committee Secretary, saying: "Compensating middle peasants for losses should not be mentioned, because land reform is not currently underway, and cadres are not clear about class divisions." As far as we know, the Second District of Yicheng has caused significant damage to the interests of middle peasants in the past, and the masses are very confused. There are still rumors circulating that "Poor peasants are in power, and middle peasants have no say." Middle peasants in Shangwu Village reflected: "Land reform is unstable, and we dare not invest capital." Zhang Ronghua, the leader of the poor peasant group in Tuqiao Village, is still acting recklessly. He took 400 dan of sheep manure from middle peasant Liu Xinghuai and transported it to his own land, saying: "We poor peasants don't even have manure. You have so much; sooner or later, it will be for us poor peasants anyway. When the grain is harvested in the autumn, it will also be for us poor peasants!" Liu Xinghuai had an ox worth 80,000 yuan, which was also forced to be bought for only 40,000 yuan. Zhang Ronghua also made middle peasants carry water, grind flour, and plow the fields for him. The district cadres' handling of this matter only involved removing Zhang Ronghua from his position as the leader of the poor peasant group; the middle peasants' losses were not seriously compensated. Jia Zhanbiao, a middle peasant in Xucun Village, wanted to hand over his land to the farmers' association, saying: "I have nothing to eat. I am willing to take my wife and beg for a little food." Since the situation is so chaotic, we should immediately publicize our middle peasant policy to the masses and correct the mistakes that have already occurred. Li Qi of the Yicheng County Committee wants the lower levels to "not mention it," which means allowing them to continue to act recklessly, which is a complete violation of the Party's policy.

(Editor's Note: According to the submitted manuscript, the Yicheng County Committee's handling of wrongly accused middle peasants is inconsistent with the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee. The Central Bureau instructed: "As spring plowing is imminent, the first priority should be to provide the wrongly accused middle peasants with some grain and major means of production to enable them to engage in production with peace of mind. The remaining losses can be compensated during the replenishment. Those middle peasants whose doors were sealed should have the error admitted unconditionally, and the seals should be removed immediately..." The Yicheng County Committee's "not mentioning it" approach is wrong and they should immediately act in accordance with the Central Bureau's instructions.)

### 翼城县委对补偿错斗中农　没按中央局指示办事

　　翼城县委对补偿错斗中农
  　没按中央局指示办事
    【太岳消息】据本社河微同志从翼城来信说：对赔偿中农损失，翼城县委提出，不公开提出来让人人都知道，只叫干部处理问题的时候注意。前两天翼城县委李奇同志给二区分委书记写信又说：“赔偿中农损失，因现在不搞土改，干部对划阶级不明确，故不提为妥。”据我们知道的，翼城二区过去损害中农利益并不轻，群众思想很混乱，现在还流传说：“雇贫掌大权，中农没有发言权。”上吴村中农反映：“土改不稳定，不敢下资本。”土桥村雇贫组长张荣华还在瞎干，把中农刘兴怀的四百担羊粪，用车送到自己的地里，还说：“我雇贫都没粪，你有这么些，迟早还不是为咱雇贫放着，秋天打下粮食也还不是为咱雇贫准备着！”刘兴怀有一头牛，值八万元，也被强迫买去，只给了四万元。张荣华还派中农给他担水、推磨、犁地。区干部对这件事的处理，只撤了张荣华雇贫组长的职，中农的损失并没有认真的补偿。许村中农贾占标要往农会交地，他说：“没吃的了，愿意领上老婆要的吃一点。”下面既然这般混乱，应该马上向群众公开宣传咱们的中农政策，纠正已发生的错误。翼城县委李奇同志要下面“不提为妥”，这就是让下面继续胡闹下去，是完全违犯党的政策的。

    （编者按：据来稿，翼城县委对错斗中农的处理，与中央局对太岳区党委指示精神是不符的。中央局指示说：“春耕在即，首应补给被斗中农部分粮食与主要生产资料，使其安心生产，其余损失，可俟抽补时再补。中农被封门者，一律承认错误，无条件的立即启封…………。”翼城县委这种“不提为妥”的作法是错误的。应立即按中央局指示办事。）
