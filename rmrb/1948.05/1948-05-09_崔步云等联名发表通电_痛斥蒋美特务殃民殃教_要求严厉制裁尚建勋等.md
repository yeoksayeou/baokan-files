Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji) 7th Dispatch: Cui Buyun, President of the Jesuit General Church of the Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Diocese in Xian County, along with Yang Tianmu, President of the Bishop's Residence, priests Ding Mingsheng (French), An Jinde (French), monk Ji Zhixun (French), Ran Jiakeya (Canadian), President of the Precious Blood Society, An Chunlu, President of the Souls' Mother Society, Yin Chunxu, President of the Chinese Virgin Mary Society, and Liu Xisheng, President of St. Joseph's Hospital, and 36 others, have jointly issued a circular telegram, denouncing the crimes of Chiang-American spies Shang Jianxun and Pan Rulin in harming the people and the church. The original telegram stated:

　　To all Catholics and people from all walks of life: Our church has been established here for over 90 years. However, in recent years, due to erroneous and lawless leadership, grave mistakes have been made. In 1946, Shang Jianxun, then President of the Jesuit Church, secretly colluded with the Kuomintang 11th War Zone Commander Sun Lianzhong's troops, along with Pan Rulin, Mu Qihua, Liao Ye'er and other responsible persons, to attack the liberated areas of equality, fraternity, freedom, peace and happiness. Subsequently, American spies in China, Mao De, came to our church twice, and Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Mu Qihua, Li Shitang, and others reported important intelligence on the military and political affairs of the liberated areas to him, and consulted with him overnight, gladly accepting espionage missions. An even greater crime was the secret installation of a radio station in Li Shitang's room in the church hospital, where Pan Rulin, She Yuren, Li Shitang, and others searched for information on the People's Liberation Army and local organizations, and sent telegrams to the Chiang-American spy agencies in Tianjin and other places. In addition, they even bought off Catholics to steal secret documents from the Communist Party, in order to more deeply study and undermine the work of the liberated areas. Wu Huaichi and Jia Shushan (priests) of the school also repeatedly collected intelligence on the military, political, economic and cultural affairs of the liberated areas, recorded them one by one, compiled them into books, and defamed them. Pan Rulin then translated them into French, and She Yuren (priest), who was full of evil deeds, took them to Tianjin. All the above crimes have been thoroughly investigated by the democratic government, both inside and outside the church. Buyun and others have personally witnessed all kinds of conclusive evidence, and could not help but tremble on the spot. When we thought about how Shang, Pan and others wore the sacred cloak of our Catholic Church, and used it to harm the people and subvert the democratic government, we realized that they were insane, acting against the tide of history, and were indeed the scum of religion and the vermin of the people. They were extremely vicious and their crimes deserved a thousand deaths. Buyun and others are ashamed to be associated with them. We solemnly declare that we will never recognize them as superiors, and we demand that the democratic government impose severe sanctions on them, in order to eradicate the root of the disaster for our church and the people.

　　Recalling the past, Buyun and others were deceived by them and fell into a state of confusion, misunderstanding the policies of the democratic government. Now, looking back at the leniency of the democratic government and its respect for the customs of the church, we are filled with boundless gratitude and remorse. Thinking of this, we truly want to cry without tears. From now on, Buyun and others are determined to change our ways, reorganize church affairs, and abide by the laws and decrees of the democratic government in order to atone for our past mistakes. We respectfully report this to you, hoping that you will understand the original situation.

　　Cui Buyun, President of the Jesuit General Church of the Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Diocese in Xian County, priests Liu Bin, Yang Tianmu, Xu Ruixuan, priests Tian Fengting, Ding Mingsheng, Xu Si, An Jinde (French), Liu Qinxiu, Bu Qingyun (French), monks Lang Haisheng, Ji Zhixun (French), Han Mali (French), Ge Feng, Li Yuankai, Li Fangrong, Zhu Guangjiong, Lei Zhensheng (French), Xu Xiangyuan, Yang Qingyun, Liu Xingfu, Ma Dongzhi, Liu Zhuting, Wan Zhanming, Geng Wanli, Zhang Hongqi, Song Yunjing (French), Yang Quanyi, Sun Shutang, Zhu Zhi, Wang Ligong, Wang Yongkai, Ran Jiakeya (Canadian), President of the Precious Blood Society, An Chunlu, President of the Souls' Mother Society, Yin Chunxu, President of the Chinese Virgin Mary Society, and Liu Xisheng, President of St. Joseph's Hospital, March 1948.
