Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region], 29th: The Hebei-Central Financial and Economic Office and the General Trade Union jointly convened the first Hebei-Central Industrial Conference on March 6th. The conference lasted half a month, with 164 attendees, including representatives of workers, technicians, factory owners, and managers from both public and private factories. The conference reviewed the "Leftist" adventurist thinking in the Hebei-Central labor movement over the past few years, as well as the blindness and extravagance of factory management organs. It determined the future direction and tasks of the labor movement and industrial development. Currently, Hebei-Central's industries include textiles, agricultural tool manufacturing, leather making, shipbuilding, chemicals, and electricity, among other major industries. Many industrial products are already self-sufficient, and cloth can be supplied in large quantities to fraternal liberated areas, playing a significant role in supporting the war and meeting the needs of the masses. The conference decided on the following development directions for the future:

(1) Based on the demands of the war and the needs of the masses, vigorously restore and develop sideline occupations, handicrafts, workshops, and factory production, and appropriately develop machine production.

(2) Specific tasks and development priorities: (A) All private industries, whether in towns or villages, must be firmly protected and supported, and past mistakes must be corrected. Organizing under voluntary conditions and cooperative management should be promoted, and the government and public economic sectors should provide specific assistance and technical guidance. (B) State-owned industries should focus on operating large-scale enterprises that the masses are unable to undertake and that are of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihoods. Factories and workshops legitimately operated by government organs and troops must be helped to develop. (C) Among the three types of industries—state-owned, private, and cooperatively managed—the leadership focus should be placed on small-scale private and cooperatively managed industries (currently, state-owned industries cannot account for a significant proportion). (D) At present, priority should be given to the production of industries urgently needed for the war and by the people. The rest should either be developed in a focused and concentrated manner or restored and developed conditionally. However, regardless of the industry, the requirements of low cost and high quality must be met.

(3) Operating principles for state-owned industries: (A) The development of state-owned industries must have certain conditions. If the conditions are good, develop them; if the conditions do not allow, do less or stop. (B) Rectify operating and management methods, play a leading role in various industries, and provide assistance, without forming a monopoly or restricting the development of other industries. (C) Move towards enterprise management and vigorously carry out the economy and production movement. (D) Promote the sideline and handicraft production of the masses, and where possible, state-owned enterprises should combine with sideline occupations to compensate for the lack of machine conditions. This can both reduce costs and provide technical and production and sales assistance to the masses.

　　纠正工运中“左”倾冒险主义
  　冀中开首次工业会议
  　民营工业必须坚决保护扶助
    【新华社晋察冀二十九日电】冀中财经办事处和总工会于三月六日联合召开冀中首次工业会议，历时半月，出席会议的有公营、私营工厂工人代表、技师、厂主、经理等一百六十四人。会中检讨了几年来冀中工运中的“左”倾冒险主义思想及工厂管理机关的盲目性与铺张浪费现象，确定今后工运与工业发展方针和任务。目前冀中工业有纺织、农具制造、制革、造船、化学、电汽等主要工业，许多工业品已能自给自足，布匹已能大量供给兄弟解放区，在支援战争与解决群众需要上起了很大作用，大会决定今后发展方针：（一）根据战争要求及群众需要，大力恢复与发展副业、手工业、作坊、工厂生产，并适当发展机器生产。（二）具体任务与发展重点：（甲）不论城镇和乡村，一切民营工业必须坚决保护扶助，纠正过去所犯错误。提倡在自愿条件下组织起来，合作经营，政府和公营经济部门要给予具体帮助和技术指导。（乙）国营工业应着重经营群众无力兴办与国计民生有重大关系的大型企业，对机关部队合法经营的工厂、作坊必须帮助其发展。（丙）在国营、私营与合作经营三种工业中，领导重点放在小型的私营和合作经营工业上（目前国营工业还不能占重要比重）。（丁）目前应把对战争亟需人民亟需的工业的生产放在第一位，其余或采取有重点的集中发展或有条件的恢复与发展，但不论何种工业，都要做到成本低质量好的要求。（三）国营工业的经营方针：（甲）发展国营工业，必须有一定条件，条件好，就发展，条件不允许，就少作或停止。（乙）整顿经营与管理方法，对各行业发挥领导带头与扶助作用，不能形成垄断或限制其他工业的发展。（丙）走向企业化，并大力开展节约与生产运动。（丁）要推动群众的副业、手工业生产，并在可能条件下，国营企业要与副业结合，补足机器条件的不足，这样可一面减低成本，一面对群众进行技术与产销的帮助。
