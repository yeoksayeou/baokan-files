Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to news from Beiping: The isolated stronghold of Shenyang, under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, is desolate and prices are soaring. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits stipulate a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. every day, but usually, the streets are deserted even before the curfew begins. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Shenyang are extremely panicked, and many agencies are deserted. Even Chiang Kai-shek's "Air Defense Headquarters" has fled to Jinzhou. The vast majority of stores in Shenyang have closed down. Food prices have skyrocketed. At the beginning of last month, flour cost 7-8 million Chiang coins per bag, and sorghum rice cost 120,000 Chiang coins per catty. An egg costs 200,000 Chiang coins. Hunger is rampant, and robberies are particularly common, mostly committed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, causing unrest throughout the city. More and more Shenyang citizens are seeking a bright future in the Liberated Areas. Even the Associated Press admits that Shenyang citizens are "going north, apparently hoping to find a place to live in the Communist areas."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to foreign news agencies: The third price storm in the Chiang Kai-shek area this year is intensifying. After a slight dip, the price of rice in Shanghai rose to 4.7 million Chiang coins per dan on the 4th of this month, breaking the highest record of 4.5 million Chiang coins per dan in the second price storm, an increase of 3.8 times since the beginning of the year. The black market price of US dollars rose even further to 1 million Chiang coins on the 5th, exceeding the highest price of the previous storm by 90 percent, and an increase of more than six times since the beginning of the year. The price of gold also rose to a new high of 48 million Chiang coins. Because the black market exchange rate has exceeded Chiang Kai-shek's "official rate" (324,000 yuan) by 187 percent, the exploitation of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on exporters in the Chiang Kai-shek area has become increasingly severe (according to Chiang Kai-shek's regulations, exporters must settle the foreign exchange they earn with the bandit Central Bank at the official rate, which has caused "export trade in the Chiang Kai-shek area to virtually come to a standstill" (Reuters)).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. According to news from Tianjin newspapers: Grain prices in Tianjin continue to soar after Chiang Kai-shek implemented "grain rationing." As of April 20, the price of "warship" flour had risen to 2.45 million Chiang coins per bag, an increase of 470,000 Chiang coins since April 1; the price of rice per catty reached 45,000 Chiang coins, compared to 38,000 Chiang coins at the beginning of the month; the price of sorghum rice per catty also rose to 27,500 Chiang coins. The prices of industrial products are also rising in competition.

　　津沪等地物价再涨
  　沈阳鸡蛋每枚二十万蒋币
    【新华社陕北六日电】据北平消息：蒋匪统治下的孤立据点沈阳一片荒凉，物价飞涨。蒋匪规定每日自晚八时至次晨六时实行戒严，但通常戒严时间还未到，街上即空无一人。沈市蒋匪极为惊慌，许多机关已无人办公，连蒋匪“防空司令部”亦已逃往锦州。沈阳绝大多数商店均已歇业倒闭。食品价格暴涨，上月初面粉每袋已涨到蒋币（下同）七八百万元，高粱米每斤也涨到十二万元。鸡蛋一枚已卖到二十万元。饥饿逼人，抢案特别多，大多系蒋匪军所为，致使全市惶惶不安。沈阳市民向解放区寻求光明出路者日多，连美联社也承认，沈市民正“向北走，他们显然希望在共产党地区内寻求安身之所。”
    【新华社陕北六日电】据外国通讯社消息：蒋区今年第三次物价风暴涨势日益凶猛。上海大米经回跌后，本月四日每担已涨达蒋币（下同）四百七十万元，冲破第二个物价风暴中每担四百五十万元的最高纪录，较年初已上涨三倍八。黑市美钞五日更涨达一百万元，超出上次风暴最高价的百分之九十，较年初涨了六倍以上。黄金亦涨达四千八百万元的新高峰。由于黑市外汇已超过蒋匪“牌价”（三十二万四千元）达百分之一百八十七，蒋区出口商人所受蒋匪剥夺愈见惨重（按蒋匪规定出口商须将所得外汇以牌价结售匪中央银行，致蒋区“出口贸易事实上已陷停顿”（路透社）。
    【新华社陕北五日电】据津报消息：天津粮价在蒋匪实行“粮食配售”后继续飞涨。截至四月二十日止，兵船面粉每袋已涨到蒋币（下同）二百四十五万元，较四月一日上涨四十七万元；稻米每斤直抵四万五千元大关，月初为三万八千元；高粱米每斤也涨到二万七千五百元。工业品价格亦竞相上涨。
