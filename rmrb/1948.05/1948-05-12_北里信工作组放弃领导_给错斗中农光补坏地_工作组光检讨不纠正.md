[Taihang News] The Beilixin Work Group in Xiangyuan, due to a one-sided view favoring poor and hired peasants, abandoned leadership, leading to left-leaning errors in the land redistribution movement, such as excluding middle peasants and failing to properly resettle landlords and rich peasants. After making self-criticisms, they showed no determination to correct the errors. In this village, after land was extracted, it was distributed through discussions in farmers' association groups on the 17th and 18th of last month, in a self-reporting and public discussion manner. However, an undemocratic principle was established in the self-reporting process: only the number of mu (a Chinese unit of measurement for land) was reported, not the quality, distance, or location of the land. Those with less land felt that they didn't know what kind of land they would get, so they might as well just plant a little less. Therefore, they didn't even report the number of mu. Later, after discussion, it was realized that this idea was wrong, and everyone reported. On the 19th, the reports were submitted to the farmers' representative meeting for discussion. Although the work group had the idea of "satisfying the demands of poor and hired peasants and compensating wrongfully struggled middle peasants" in mind, in practice, they only sided with the poor and hired peasants, forgetting the middle peasants, and combined with the left-leaning sentiments of individual representatives and committee members. They did not compensate the wrongfully struggled middle peasants according to policy but still treated them as "struggle households." They did not discuss the cases of landlords and rich peasants and completely allocated bad land to them. When evaluating the case of Fan Chengshan, a wrongfully struggled middle peasant, one representative said, "This good land doesn't belong to him" and allocated it to Bai Manqi, a poor and hired peasant, and replaced it with another piece of bad land for Fan Chengshan. Li Xiangzhi (wrongfully struggled poor peasant) and Han Xihai (wrongfully struggled middle peasant) have been planting remote and bad land since they were struggled against, and this time they were still allocated remote and bad land. The situation was the same in the distribution of houses. Wrongfully struggled middle and poor peasants could not get any. Representatives always exchanged broken ones for good ones, and cave courtyards for house courtyards. After the results of the evaluation were announced, wrongfully struggled households said, "What they say is one thing, but what they do is another." The general public said, "The new cadres are not as good as the old cadres! The old cadres can make self-criticisms and admit their mistakes, but these new cadres are selfish and self-serving as soon as they take office." According to the work group's self-criticism, the main reasons for these errors were a lack of clarity regarding the Party's policies, a failure to accept the complete class line. Among the thirty-one representatives elected, only five were middle peasants, and they did not speak much at the farmers' association meetings. The work group did not conduct any prior investigation or discuss the matter with the Party branch, and at the meeting, they simply followed the representatives' lead, adopting a liberal attitude of abandoning leadership. Whatever the representatives said, they went along with, which fostered the selfish and self-serving thoughts and behavior of the new cadres. Although the self-criticism clarified some points, the work group's final decision still showed a lack of determination to correct the errors and a reluctance to boldly negate the past and formulate new guidelines. For example, the last point in the future actions stated: "Assign one person to be responsible for statistics, and determine how much good and bad land is left after the distribution, and where to make up for the shortages." This clearly does not demonstrate a firm resolution to correct past mistakes, and therefore, it will certainly not be possible to correctly implement the land redistribution policy.

### 北里信工作组放弃领导  给错斗中农光补坏地  工作组光检讨不纠正

    北里信工作组放弃领导
    给错斗中农光补坏地
    工作组光检讨不纠正
    【太行消息】襄垣北里信工作组由于片面的贫雇观点，放弃领导，致在填补运动中犯了排斥中农与不好好安置地主富农的左倾错误。经过检讨，亦无纠正的决心。该村于抽出土地后，在上月十七、十八两日，以农会小组讨论分配，方式是自报公议。但在自报中就确定了个不民主的原则：只报亩数，不报好坏远近，少地的人觉得还不知分上什么地呀！少种上点就算了吧。因此亩数也不报。后来经过讨论，这个思想不对，才都报开。十九号即交到农代会讨论。讨论时工作组在思想上虽也有个“满足贫雇要求，给错斗中农补偿”的观念，但在实际执行中却只站在了贫雇方面，忘记了中农，与个别代表委员们的左倾情绪结合，对错斗中农不遵照政策进行补偿，仍当“斗争户”看待；对地主富农则不加讨论，完全分的是坏地。评到错斗中农范成山时，有一块好地，代表们说：“这块好地该不着他”，给贫雇白满齐分上，把另一块坏地给他换上了。李相支（错斗贫农）、韩喜孩（错斗中农）自被斗后，就种的是远地坏地，这次仍然把远的坏的分给他们。分房时更是如此，错斗中贫农分不上，代表们都是破的换成好的，窑院换成房院。评议结果公布后，错斗户说：“嘴说一样，实际还是两样”；一般群众说：“新干部还不如旧干部哩！人家能检讨认错，他们刚上台就自私自利”。根据工作组检讨：这些错误的主要原因是对党的政策不明确，没有接受完整的阶级路线，在选举代表中，三十一个代表只有五个中农，在农会上也不多发言。工作组事先无调查，也未同支部研究，会上又是跟着代表尾巴跑，采取了放弃领导的自由主义态度，代表们说啥是啥，助长了新干部自私自利的思想与作风。经过这样检讨，虽然较前明确了一些，但在该工作组最后决定中，仍表现对纠正错误的决心不够，还不敢大胆的否定过去，重新定出新的方针。如在今后作法最后一条说：“抽出一人负责统计，除分出之外，留下好坏地各多少，该那里补齐就补齐”。这显然不是坚决纠正过去错误，所以也一定不能正确贯彻填补政策。
