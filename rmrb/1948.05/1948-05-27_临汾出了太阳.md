Linfen Sees the Sun
　　Wang Feng

　　After our army captured Linfen City on the evening of the 17th, on the morning of the 18th, except for a small number of troops left in the city to search for scattered and hidden remnants of the enemy, all combat troops were withdrawn outside the city in formation. Our city defense troops and democratic government workers had already entered the city to maintain order and appease the citizens. All factories, shops, schools, civilian houses, and public buildings immediately presented a peaceful scene. The troops entering the city not only maintained strict discipline, without violating the slightest thing, but also took responsibility for protecting those shops and factories that were unattended. At this time, citizens wearing various kinds of clothing, with smiling faces, carrying luggage, and holding children, came from all directions of the city, returning to their homes. Workers from the waterworks and the Fuxing Iron Factory voluntarily gathered together, demanding to start work immediately. In the afternoon of the 18th, the waterworks started supplying water. Citizens, getting plenty of water to drink, excitedly discussed, "This is so convenient! There's much more water than when the stubborn (referring to the Chiang-Yan bandits) were here!" The electric grinding plant attached to the Fuxing Iron Factory also started work immediately. When the troops responsible for guarding the waterworks withdrew, they said to the workers, "Please inspect us first; we are not allowed to take even a single item." And they kindly asked, "Worker comrades, have you lost anything? Have you suffered any losses?" The workers were very touched and replied in unison, "Not at all!" and said in one voice, "Our troops are too good!" Automobile workers, despite the bombing by Chiang's bandit planes, were still speeding up the repair of cars, preparing to drive them outside the city for air defense, and dozens were repaired in a short time. The Shansheng Hospital, run by Christians, under the encouragement of the democratic municipal government, took in wounded and sick enemy soldiers, and many ordinary people went there for treatment. The director of the Linfen Hygiene Hospital voluntarily approached Director Xiao of our army's Health Department to discuss the hospital's opening, and more than 100 citizens and wounded soldiers were treated as outpatients in one day. After we took over the Chiang bandit army's 47th and 77th Field Hospitals, we immediately convened the original doctors and staff, and took in all the wounded soldiers of the Chiang-Yan army, immediately taking in more than 3,000 people. But the inhumane Chiang bandits actually sent planes to bomb the hospital on the 19th, collapsing two wards and killing or further wounding fifty-one people. All the wounded soldiers angrily cursed, "Chiang Kai-shek, you son of a bitch! We were deceived and oppressed in the past, risking our lives for you, and now you use planes to bomb us! We're not human if we don't avenge this!" Some said, "Now we understand who our enemy is, who harmed us, and who our benefactor is, who saved us." Some people immediately went to the work cadres of our army stationed in the hospital and said, "Once my injuries are healed, I will definitely join the People's Liberation Army, fight to Nanjing, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!"
　　
　　Linfen Normal School, Sanlian Middle School, Women's Normal School, Linfen Middle School, and other schools have successively contacted comrades of the municipal government to discuss the matter of resuming classes. Commissioner Shi immediately went to Linfen Normal School to convene a forum for teachers and students, where they accused the school of being ruled by seven kinds of Chiang-Yan bandit police, army, "People's Service Team," security police, military police, inspectors, and supervisory teams. Forty-five people were arrested in seventeen days, and seven students were killed. The students were not free to urinate, and had no place to defecate. Duan Liqing, a physics and chemistry teacher at Linfen Normal School, also accused the Chiang-Yan bandit army of forcing him to manufacture poisonous gas, speaking with great grief and indignation. After being comforted by Commissioner Shi, they finally decided to go separately to mobilize students who had not yet returned to school to return to class. From then on, students returned to school in an endless stream, with thirty to forty people returning to Linfen Normal School every day. They asked for leadership from the democratic government, requested to see newspapers, publications, and magazines, and actively prepared for the start of school. Liu Gongyuan, the director of studies at Linfen Normal School, also stated to our army: At first, he did not understand our policy. When a soldier asked him what he did, he said fearfully, "I am a teacher, an ordinary citizen." The soldier calmly said, "Oh, a teacher." He was immediately weighed down and trembled by these words. The Chiang-Yan bandit gang had been spreading rumors every day about how the Communist Party killed people, and those situations immediately floated into his mind, thinking that this was the end. But our soldier replied very kindly and earnestly, "Don't be afraid; we protect the teaching community." At this time, half of the stone in his heart fell, but he was still skeptical. Soon, he saw that the troops respected the school very much, and saw some soldiers wearing torn shoes, not taking leather shoes when they saw them, not wearing clothes when they saw them, which truly educated him, and then he was completely at ease. He said, "You truly do not take a needle or a thread from the masses; you do what you say, and you are indeed the People's Liberation Army!" The Mantuan Theater requested the democratic government to send someone to guide them and opened on the 20th, with a very crowded audience.

　　The merchants on each street, after listening to our work team's propaganda about our industrial and commercial policies, and seeing our army's protective actions towards industry and commerce, immediately busied themselves cleaning up the courtyards and tidying up the storefronts. Wanjintang on East Street and the Xinji Barber Shop started business on the 18th. Rongtaichang, a large business in Dongguan, also returned and prepared to open for business, and many merchants actively approached us, proposed solutions, and restored the market. Li Chai, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, talked to our comrades, saying that more than 400 shops wanted to resume business. They asked if they could go to Shijiazhuang to do business, and asked the democratic government to convene a meeting of merchants and civilians to discuss how to open their doors. Many merchants and civilians complained that their goods had been requisitioned by the Chiang-Yan bandits. Coarse and fine foreign cloth had been made into sandbags. Some had been asked to provide sixty towels for "comfort." The vegetables had been eaten up. The door panels had been taken away to make fortifications. The shop assistants had been seized to do construction, and there had been no business for four or five months. Liang Peizhi, a merchant and civilian, said, "The stubborn army forces, forces, forces people to death! Fortunately, you came to liberate us!" One business asked the government, "We are a private business, but we have a Sanqing Tuan (Three People's Principles Youth League) plaque and are under their control. What should we do?"

　　Enemy and puppet personnel also voluntarily registered with the democratic government. Zhao Yanlong, a member of the 38th Army Officer Team stationed in Linfen, wrote a letter to the city defense headquarters, stating in essence: "I originally served as a company commander under Yang Hucheng, was incorporated into the surplus officer team, and was detained in Linfen. Due to the tense war situation, prisoners were released to work. Now, due to serious injuries, I am requesting permission to stay in my original place." The city defense headquarters and the democratic government immediately approved his request.

　　The general public felt that they had escaped the bitter sea of death and oppression and had obtained the joy of peace and freedom, walking back and forth on the streets in droves, breathing the free air they had not enjoyed for many years. An old man surnamed Huang in South Street, in his forties, from Jiyuan, was happier than celebrating the New Year. He said, "Now my heart is stable. You don't know how the stubborns spread rumors that our Eighth Route Army spares no one. These stubborns are really shameful. I just bought ten pounds of cornmeal, and it was snatched away by the stubborns. I knelt down and begged without success, and was even beaten. Alas! I haven't seen a bit of white flour this year!" After a pause, he said very happily, "You came, and we saw wheat again. If you hadn't come in a few more days, we wouldn't have had anything to eat!" At the same time, the people standing next to him all seemed to be singing in chorus, loudly saying, "We can eat wheat this year!" Linfen City, which had been suppressed to death by the Chiang-Yan bandit gang, is now awakening and becoming active again. In all the streets and alleys, one can hear phrases praising the Communist Party at any time. On a wall from Drum Tower to West Gate, there were written these few sentences, fully expressing the heartfelt gratitude of the people of Linfen:
　　"Cloudy days are not as long as sunny days,
　　Linfen suddenly sees the sun,
　　If you ask who the sun is,
　　It is the Chinese Communist Party!"

　　临汾出了太阳
    王蜂
    我军于十七日晚攻占临汾城后，十八日晨，除留少数部队在城内搜索分散隐藏的残敌外，所有作战部队均整队撤出城外。我城防部队与民主政府工作人员早已入城维持秩序，安抚市民，一切工厂商店学校民房和公共建筑都马上呈现和平的景象。入城的部队不但纪律严明，秋亳无犯，而且负责把那些无人照管的商店工厂保护起来。这时穿着各色各样服装的市民面带笑容，扛着行李、抱着小孩，从城的四面八方进来，纷纷返回自己的家。自来水工厂的工人和复兴铁工厂的工人，都自动集合起来，要求马上开工。十八日午后，自来水工厂即开工放水。市民得到充分的水喝，兴奋的议论着：“这可方便啦，水比顽固（指蒋阎匪）在时多得多啦！”复兴铁工厂附设电磨厂也马上开了工。我负责看守自来水工厂的部队撤出时对工人说：“请你们先检查我们，我们是不准拿一点东西的。”并亲切的询问：“工人同志，你们丢了东西没有？有损失没有？”工人很受感动的回答：“一点也没有！”并异口同声的说：“咱这队伍太好啦！”汽车工人在蒋匪飞机轰炸下，还在加紧修理汽车，准备开出城外防空，一时就修好几十辆。基督教办的善胜医院，在民主市政府勉励下收容敌人的伤病员，并有很多老百姓前去治病。临汾卫生医院院长自动找着我军卫生部肖主任商讨医院开办事宜，一天门诊一百多市民和伤病员。蒋匪陆军野战四七医院和七七医院经我接收之后，马上就召集了原来的医生和工作人员，将蒋阎军的伤兵都收容起来，一下收容了三千多人。但丧失人性的蒋匪于十九日竟派飞机来轰炸医院，炸塌病房两座，炸死和伤上加伤的五十一人。所有的伤兵都气愤的破口大骂：“蒋介石狗娘养的！老子们过去受蒙蔽欺压，替你卖命，挂了彩，现在你用飞机来轰炸咱们，老子不报这个仇不是人！”有的就说：“这一下咱们可明白了谁是咱们的仇人，害了咱们；谁是咱们的恩人，救了咱们。”有一些人当时就跑去找着我军驻在医院的工作干部说：“我伤好了一定参加解放军，打到南京去，活捉蒋介石！”
    临汾师范、三联中学、女子师范、临汾中学等学校均先后找市政府工作同志接洽开课事宜。史专员马上就到临汾师范召集教员学生开了一个座谈会，他们控诉过去学校受蒋阎匪警察、军队、“人民服务队”、保警队、宪兵、稽察队、监务队七种统治，十七天被逮捕四十五人，七个学生被杀。学生们小便不自由，大便无处拉。临汾师范理化教员段利清还向我军控诉蒋阎匪军强迫他制造毒瓦斯的罪恶行为，说时非常悲愤。经史专员给安慰后，他们最后决议分头去动员尚未返校的学生返校复课，从此学生即络绎不绝返校，临汾师范一天返校三四十人。他们要求民主政府领导，提出要报纸刊物杂志看，积极准备开学。临汾师范教务主任刘功远亦向我军申述：他开初对我政策不了解，战士问他干什么，他很恐惧的说：“我是老百姓教书的。”战士就泰然的说：“哦，教员。”他当时被这句话压得沉重而发抖，蒋阎匪帮天天造谣宣传共产党如何杀人，那些情况马上浮到他的脑海，心想这可完了。但我战士却很和气恳切的回答：“不要怕，我们是保护教员界的。”这时他心上的石头掉了一半，但仍是将信将疑的。不久他看到部队对学校很尊重，并看到有些战士穿的破鞋子，见到皮鞋不拿，见到衣服不穿，真正教育了他，然后才完全安下心来。他说：“你们真正不拿群众一针一线，说到做到，确实是人民解放军！”曼团戏院向民主政府要求派人指导他们，已于二十日开场，观众拥挤得很。
    各街的商人在听了我工作队宣传我们的工商业政策，看到我军对工商业的保护行动后，立刻就忙着打扫院房，整理门面。东大街万金堂和新记理发馆十八日就开始营业了。东关大商号荣泰昌老板也回来准备开门营业，还有许多商人主动找我们，提出办法，恢复市面。商会会长李柴找着我们同志谈，有四百多家商店要复业，他们问能不能到石家庄去做买卖，要求民主政府召开商民会议商讨如何开门。很多商民诉说他们货物被蒋阎匪征光了，粗细洋布做了沙袋了，有的几家要六十条毛巾拿去“慰劳”了，菜都吃完了，门板搞去做了工事，店员被抓去做工事，四五个月没做买卖了。商民梁培志说：“顽军把人逼，逼，逼，非逼死不可！好在你们来解放了！”有一家买卖向政府提出：“我们是私人买卖，挂了三青团牌子，受人家管，该怎办呢？”
    敌伪人员亦纷纷自动到民主政府登记。三八集团军军官队留守临汾队员赵彦龙写信给城防司令部，大意称：“我原在杨虎城部下充任连长，编入编余的军官队，后扣押在临汾时，因战事紧张，犯人放出作工，现因伤重呈请，准予住原地不动。”城防司令部及民主政府当即批准了他的要求。
    一般市民都感到脱离了死亡与压迫的苦海，已经得到和平自由的快乐，熙熙攘攘地在街上走来走去，呼吸着多年来享受不到的自由空气。南街一个四十多岁的黄老汉，济源人，他喜得比过新年还高兴。他说：“这下心可稳了。你可不知道顽固造谣说咱八路军见人不留，这些顽固真可耻，我刚买了十斤玉米面，一下子被顽固抢走了，我跪着哀求不成，还被打了一顿。唉！今年还没见过一点白面呢！”停了停又很畅快的说：“你们来了，我们才又看到了麦子。要是再过些天不来，可就吃不上了！”同时站在他旁边的人都好象合唱似的一齐高声说：“今年可吃上麦子了！”原来被蒋阎匪帮压死了的临汾城，现在又苏醒活跃起来了。在一切大街小巷里，可以随时听到称赞共产党的词句。从鼓楼到西门的一个墙壁上就写着这样几句话，充分表现了临汾市民衷心的感激：
     “阴天没有晴天长，
     临汾突然出太阳，
     要问太阳是哪个，
     就是中国共产党！”
