　　【Taihang News】Xiuwu held a county, district, and village cadre meeting from May 1st to 3rd, mobilizing and discussing the upcoming wheat protection struggle, and calling for the launch of a ten thousand landmine explosion campaign. At the meeting, in reviewing the previous anti-enemy struggle, it was reflected that there was paralysis and waiting among the cadres, to the point of abandoning leadership and doing nothing, which affected the development of guerrilla warfare and put the anti-enemy struggle situation in a passive state. In addition to strictly criticizing the above-mentioned ideas, the spirit of everyone was raised by explaining the current victorious situation of our army and praising the model deeds of village cadres and militiamen in Anyang Cheng Village, Liangma Village, Dongwanhe Village, etc., who persisted in the struggle and protected the interests of the masses. The leadership also practically solved the difficulties in clothing, shoes, socks, and family life of comrades who persisted in the struggle, stabilizing their working mood. After research, everyone unanimously agreed that: the struggle to protect spring plowing and sowing, and wheat harvesting, must carry out mass guerrilla warfare, improve the masses' hatred of the enemy by publicizing the victorious news of our army and exposing the enemy's conspiracies and atrocities, and stimulate the masses' fighting spirit, so as to mobilize and organize the masses to launch universal landmine warfare and sniper warfare for self-defense. It is necessary to have a "watchdog" in every household and a "roadblock" on every road. It was decided to form several work teams with districts and joint defense units, and to formulate plans to lead the masses to carry out these activities. Village cadres and militiamen must quickly form landmine explosion teams, collect broken mines and broken grenades for re-assembly, and organize the masses to chisel stone mines, ready to fight the enemy at any time. At the district meetings on May 5th, seven villages in the first district reported that they would complete 820 stone mines in ten days. The second district will complete more than 1,000 in ten days. In discussing the future protection of wheat harvesting, the third district, in addition to formulating a plan for the whole district to chisel 3,300 stone mines in ten days, also put forward the following specific methods: First, every village must organize explosion teams, every household must bury mines, and camouflage everywhere. The second is to establish joint defense, strengthen joint defense leadership, establish a joint defense headquarters, control intelligence, and support each other, and immediately prepare wheat harvesting equipment. As soon as the wheat harvest arrives, a yellow field, cut a piece, thresh the wheat on the spot, so that it can be harvested, threshed and hidden at the same time, ensuring that the enemy does not steal our wheat.

  　修武加紧保麦
    【太行消息】修武于五月一日至三日开了个县、区、村干部会议，动员讨论即将到来的保麦斗争，号召开展一万个地雷爆炸运动。会上在检讨前期对敌斗争中，反映出干部中存在着麻痹等待，以至放弃领导躺倒不干的思想，影响了游击战争的开展，使对敌斗争形势处于被动。除对上述思想进行了严格的批判外，从说明我军目前胜利形势，及表扬安阳城村、亮马村、东万和等村干部、民兵坚持斗争，保卫群众利益的模范事例中，提高了大家斗志。领导上并实际的解决了坚持斗争同志的衣服、鞋袜、家庭生活等困难，安定工作情绪。经过研究，大家一致认为：保卫春耕下种、麦收的斗争，必须开展群众性的游击战争，从宣传我军胜利消息、揭发敌人阴谋暴行中，提高群众对敌的仇恨心，激发群众的斗志，从而发动与组织群众展开普遍的地雷战、冷枪战进行自卫。要做到每家有个“看家狗”、每路有个“拦路虎”。决定以区及联防等单位组成若干工作队，并订出计划，领导群众进行。村干、民兵回去要迅速组成地雷爆炸组，收集坏雷、坏手榴弹重新装制，组织群众凿石雷，随时准备与敌人进行斗争。五月五号各区开会时，一区七个村自报十天要完成石雷八百二十个。二区十天要完成一千多个。三区在讨论今后保卫麦收中，除订出计划全区十天要凿石雷三千三百个外，并提出如下的具体做法：首先要村村组织爆炸小组，家家埋雷，到处伪装。其次是建立联防，加强联防领导，建立联防指挥部、掌握情报、互相支援，并立即准备麦收用具等。麦收一到，黄一片，割一片，就地踩场打麦，做到随收随打随藏。保证不让敌人抢走我们的麦子。
