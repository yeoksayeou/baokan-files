　　Shahe Fourth District Intensifies Wasteland Reclamation
    [Shahe News] After the previous rainfall, the majority of land suitable for planting was sown with cotton and hoed for wheat during several days of intensive work. In this production gap, the entire Fourth District launched a campaign to eliminate both cultivated and uncultivated wasteland. During the mobilization, policies were explained to dispel the masses' concerns about increased burdens and the fear of wasted labor during equal distribution. The leadership relied on good Party members and cadres to lead the masses in this effort. The results have been considerable. According to statistics from sixteen villages, there was a total of 1,015 mu of wasteland, of which 466 mu have now been cultivated (some of which is tall grassland that cannot be opened). The rest is too dry to cultivate until after the next rainfall. Some villages will continue to eliminate wasteland.

　　沙河四区加紧灭荒
    【沙河消息】前次下雨后，经几天突击种棉锄麦，能下种的地大部下种，在这个生产空隙中，全四区展开了消灭生熟荒运动。在动员中，讲了政策，打破群众怕出负担，怕平分时分了白误工等思想，领导上依靠好党员干部，领导群众干，这一段成绩还不小。据十六个村统计，共有一千零一十五亩荒地，现在已开有四百六十六亩（内有一部分，长尖草地不能开）干开不动，等落雨后，有些村还继续消灭。
