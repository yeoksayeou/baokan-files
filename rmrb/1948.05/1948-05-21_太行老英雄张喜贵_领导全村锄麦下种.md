Taihang News: Under the leadership of the old hero Zhang Xigui and production director Zhao De, Piancheng Village, Eighth District, She County, has completed the sowing and weeding of wheat. From the third to the fifth day of the first lunar month, mutual aid teams were reorganized from dissolution to spontaneous formation through voluntary and democratic discussion. A village-wide production headquarters was elected, divided into five command posts, led by work point captains, street chiefs, and production committee members. Wages were set: a maximum of 15 points per donkey per day, and a maximum of 10 points per person per day. Whether food was provided or not, the daily wage was five catties of rice, with fixed points but flexible application. After publicizing the Land Law and the Border Government's proclamation of "whoever sows, reaps," resolving the concerns of poor peasants and hired laborers about equal distribution, the middle peasants' fear of equal distribution, and the cadres' fear of being removed from their positions, the village increased by nine cattle, two donkeys, fifty-four sheep, and thirty-three pigs. Then, recalling the lessons of late sowing and reduced autumn harvests last year, the masses' thinking was enlightened. Sowing began on the eighth day of the third lunar month. The total land in the village was 3,019 mu, with 1,080 mu of wheat land and 1,939 mu of unplanted land. By the twenty-seventh day of the third month, the sowing was completed, and the wheat land was weeded. After this production phase was completed, the masses felt they should rest after sowing and were not actively seeking other production opportunities. There were even idlers sitting on the streets. To overcome this phenomenon and further promote production, the headquarters held another meeting, deciding how to summarize the spring plowing and sowing, inspire the masses to become prosperous, and solve the specific problems of the masses. Zhang Xigui, as chairman, summarized and reported the advantages and disadvantages of sowing. For example, the first team made a plan at the beginning of sowing, first planting cotton and yams, then planting millet and corn, ensuring that no household was left behind and no one was delayed, and solving the difficulties in production. Nie Kuan, as team leader, adjusted 5 sheng of corn and 5 sheng of soybeans within his team to solve the seed shortage; Zhao Jiying personally took out 1 dou of corn, and Liu Buchang 7 jin of rice, to help households without food. Liu Huding's team used a small-scale society that could draw dividends at any time to arrange for the food and drink (a total of 2 dou and 1 sheng of rice) for Liu Qing, who had been struggled against, solving his production difficulties, and his enthusiasm was very high. In general, everyone's enthusiasm was very high. Chen Shuihe said, "Sow early, harvest well, whoever listens will benefit." In addition, four problems were identified for discussion and research: 1. The problems were not discovered during the reorganization of mutual aid, and it was only when allocating work that it was discovered that Liu Huding and Chen Er were team leaders, and last year's wages had not been settled. 2. Competing for work: when others rushed to plant millet, Zhao Jiying wanted to plant corn. 3. Some team leaders lacked leadership. Yang Dechang's team did not arrange their livelihood early, and only allocated work in the early morning, and the team members complained about being late and fearing losses, and were unwilling to use livestock to deliver manure, because fixed points and fixed quotas still formed a spontaneous flow. 4. Fearing wage payments, Li Huayuan and Liu Bao were in the same group, and the livestock were a pair. Li Huayuan used his father's livestock to plow the land, causing Bao's disagreement, and both were afraid of paying wages. The above problems also had some impact on spring plowing. After mass discussion and research within each team, solutions were determined: outstanding wages must be settled; otherwise, they would be offset with labor. Wang Shiqing said: "Regardless of what the composition is, wages must be paid." For other problems, the main thing is persuasion and education, and we must discover and discuss and solve them at any time. Liu Chenjin said: "Every village has strange people, and every group has lazy sheep, and more education is necessary." After the chairman made a final summary, a production plan was formulated before the wheat harvest and before weeding the seedlings.

　　太行老英雄张喜贵
  　领导全村锄麦下种
    【太行消息】涉县八区偏城村，在老英雄张喜贵、生产主任赵德领导下，已完成下种和锄麦工作。自阴历正月初三日至初五日，自愿原则民主讨论，由解散到自碰重新整顿了互助，选举全村生产总指挥部，下分五个指挥部，由拨工队长、街长、生产委员负责来领导。定出了工资：每天每个驴最高十五分，人最高十分，每天工资米不管饭五斤，还是死分活用。并经过宣传土地法和边府谁种谁收布告，打通了贫雇等平分，中农怕平分，干部等下台的思想后，全村又增加了九头牛、两头驴、五十四只羊、卅三口猪。接着又回忆了去年下种迟，秋后收成减少的教训，启发了群众思想。从旧历三月初八日开始下种，全村土地三千零一十九亩，麦地一千零八十亩，白地一千九百三十九亩，到三月廿七日，完成了下种，锄完了麦地。这段生产完成后，群众又产生下了种该歇歇想法，不积极的找其他生产，街上也坐有闲人。为了克服这种现象，进一步推进生产，总指挥部又召开会议，决定了如何总结春耕下种，启发群众发家致富的思想，解决群众具体思想。张喜贵当主席，总结报告了下种的优缺点。如一队在下种时，开始就作了计划，先种棉花、山药，再种谷子、玉茭，那户也不能往后放，谁也误不了，又解决了生产中困难。聂宽是组长，自己调剂到组内五升玉茭、五升黄豆，解决种子困难；赵吉英亲自拿出一斗玉茭，刘步昌七斤米，扶助了没吃户。刘虎定组用小型社随时能抽红办法，安置了被斗户刘清的吃喝（共有二斗一升米），解决了生产困难，劲头很大。总的说来，大家劲头都很高，陈水和说：“种的早，出的好，谁听了谁沾光”。另外找出了四种毛病，作了讨论研究：一、整顿互助时问题没发现，调工时才知道刘虎定、陈二的是组长，去年工资没算清。二、争工，别人突击种谷子，赵吉英就想种玉茭。三、个别组长领导差，杨德昌组早些不定好生活，清早才拨工，组员嫌迟、怕吃亏，不愿使牲口送粪，因为还是死分死定形成自流。四、怕出工资，李花元和刘保的是一组，牲口是一犋，李花元用他父亲牲口犁了地，引起保的不同意，谁也怕出工资。以上这些问题，对春耕也有些影响，在各队内经过群众讨论研究，定出了解决办法：欠工资必须算清：不然就拿工来顶。王世清说：“不管啥成份，工资总得给”。对其他问题，主要是说服教育，要随时发现随时讨论解决，刘辰金说：“村村有怪人，群群有赖羊，非多教育不行。”主席最后作了总结后，又订出麦收前和锄苗前的生产计划。
