(Lingchuan News) Yuquan Village in the Fucheng District of Lingchuan is a land reform experimental village. Currently, the branch cadres have ceased their activities, and the Poor Peasants' Association has not yet been formally established. There are many specific issues that urgently need to be resolved in the spring plowing. For example, the issue of land cultivation on behalf of military families, the new refugees who have moved in have no land to cultivate, and the middle peasants have concerns. Although general publicity and mobilization have been carried out in the past, and the work has seemingly started, the ideological concerns of the middle peasants have not been completely broken, and production morale is low.

Under these circumstances, with the poor and hired peasants as the main force, they colluded with the middle peasants and held a heart-to-heart talk meeting of middle and poor peasants in the whole village on April 15th (rainy day). First, Comrade Zhao of the work team gave a mobilization explanation of the policy, and then held heart-to-heart talks in groups, and everyone told the truth. For example, the middle peasant Dong Hai said: "The Land Law Outline has not been issued yet. I always pick up a pile of manure when I see it. After it was issued, I was classified as a wealthy middle peasant, so I was very scared. I don't even pick up manure when I see it. I only hate that my family has too many things. I just want to eat it all at once, and exchange it for sweet potato noodles and flour. Later, after listening to the meeting, I felt more at ease." The wealthy middle peasant Guo Chengyin said: "I am not afraid of drawing land and asking for things, but I am afraid of asking for things I don't have (silver dollars)." The middle peasant Jin Laixi said: "The arrival of the work team scared me so much that I worried every day that the cow would die, and if it died, I would not be a wealthy middle peasant. Now I am not afraid."

After a heated discussion, everyone agreed that fearing the past was scaring themselves, and not doing a good job was fooling themselves, creating difficulties for themselves. The Land Law Outline is to make everyone have a good time, but we misunderstood it. Then everyone seriously conducted a democratic election and elected eleven people including Zhang Caibao (eight poor and hired peasants and three middle peasants) to form a spring plowing committee. They also studied some problems with the previous mutual aid and large-scale labor exchange. Everyone agreed that they had suffered losses in the past large-scale labor exchange, but we will not use this method this time. In the future, we must truly combine voluntarily. The next morning, the spring plowing committee immediately conducted a survey of the families of military dependents and newly relocated refugees, and what difficulties the poor and hired peasants had, and are studying solutions.

(Judging from the submitted manuscripts, the masses still have misunderstandings and doubts about class divisions. The Yuquan Village Work Team should check whether there is a "leftist" tendency in the leadership of class divisions. - Editor)

### 玉泉村中农说：怕斗不好好生产是自己吓唬自己

　　玉泉村中农说：怕斗不好好生产是自己吓唬自己
    【陵川消息】陵川附城区玉泉村，是一个土改实验村，目前支部干部停止活动，贫农团尚未正式成立，春耕中有好多具体问题急须解决。如军属代耕问题，新移来难民没地种，中农有顾虑。过去虽进行过一般宣传动员，工作表面动起来啦，但中农的思想顾虑仍未彻底打破，生产情绪低落。
    在这种情况下，以贫雇为主，串通了中农，于四月十五号（雨天）开全村中贫农谈心会，首由工作组赵同志进行动员讲解了政策，然后分组谈心，大家才说出了心里话。如中农冬孩说：“土地法大纲没下来，我见一堆粪总要拾上，下来后又把我划成富裕中农啦，我就很嫌怕，见粪也不拾啦，只嫌我家的东西多，只想一下吃完，又换粉条、又换面，后来听开会说，我才比较放心。”富裕中农郭成印说：抽地要东西我不怕，就是怕要没有的东西（银洋）。中农靳来喜说：“工作组一来可把我吓坏啦，每天愁的牛不死，死了我就不当富裕中农啦。这会我可不怕啦。”
    经过热烈讨论，大家一致认为过去嫌怕是自己吓唬自己，不好好做地是自己哄自己，自己给自己找困难。土地法大纲是叫大家都过好时光，咱就了解错了。接着大家认真的进行了民主选举，共选出张才保等十一人（贫雇八人，中农三人），组成春耕委员会。又对过去互助代耕大变工一些问题作了研究，大家一致认为过去的大变工吃了亏，咱今次可不用这个办法，以后咱一定要真正自愿结合。次日一早春耕委员会即进行调查抗属新移来的难民户，和贫雇户有啥困难，正研究解决中。（玉泉工作组）。
