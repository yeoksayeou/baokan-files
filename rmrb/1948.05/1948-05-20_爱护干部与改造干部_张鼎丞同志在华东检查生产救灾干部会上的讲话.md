Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: Comrade Zhang Dingcheng elaborated on "Cherishing Cadres and Transforming Cadres" at the conference for inspecting production and disaster relief cadres on April 1st. He pointed out that to solve the cadre problem, firstly, the leadership must have clear guiding principles and policies; secondly, the cadres themselves must have a correct mental attitude. While the East China Bureau recognized the Shandong cadre problem as an extremely important issue facing the East China Party, it also proposed the guiding principles and policies of cherishing cadres, educating cadres, uniting cadres, and transforming cadres. These guiding principles and policies are completely in line with the spirit of Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's cadre policy. The correct mental attitude of the cadres themselves should be Chairman Mao's earnest teachings of being loyal to the Party's cause and the people's cause, serving the people wholeheartedly, and being selfless; it is also Dimitrov's four standards for cadres—unlimited loyalty, close ties with the masses, responsibility for work, and adherence to discipline; it is also the six standards of strong Party spirit mentioned by Political Commissar Rao—the interests of the Party above all else, unwavering adherence to the Party and class stand, a high degree of principle, a high degree of discipline, a pragmatic style, and attributing everything to the Party. Solving these two basic principles is the only way to guarantee the correct resolution of the cadre problem.

The Shandong Party's handling of cadre issues, whether in the past or present, generally has a correct aspect, and therefore has achieved results. For example, it cultivated more than 100,000 cadres, and relying on this group of cadres, it completed many arduous tasks in the eight-year War of Resistance and the two-year People's Revolutionary War, and achieved many victories. This is something to be treasured. However, on the other hand, most of it violated the above-mentioned correct principles, which is that the leadership lacked clear guiding principles and policies for cadres, and even used incorrect guiding principles and policies. For example: not caring about cadres, not paying attention to improving cadres' theoretical and political level and work ability, allowing cadres to drift, neglecting education and training, and even treating cadres with a sectarian spirit. They were either numb to the mistakes of cadres, or condoned and indulged them, or used punitive methods to struggle against and attack them. This is a serious error in the leadership's handling of cadres. As for the mental attitude of the cadres themselves, there are also many serious shortcomings and errors, such as individualism, corruption, obtaining excessive land and fruits, neglecting the interests of the Party and the people, not humbly learning to improve Party spirit and work ability, being self-righteous, using coercion and commandism, and lacking self-criticism and consciously correcting mistakes when mistakes were made. All the above-mentioned errors of the leadership and the cadres themselves must be thoroughly corrected and resolved. Incorrect handling of cadre issues will lead to serious consequences, which will cause ideological confusion and alienation from the masses among the Party's cadres. For example: when many Party committees and leading cadres discover serious mistakes of cadres, instead of calmly and carefully studying the cadres, instead of proceeding from cherishing, educating, uniting, and transforming, they lose confidence in the transformation of cadres' mistakes, and even hate them, thinking they are no good, and therefore do not believe that cadres can progress, do not believe that cadres can be transformed, and therefore simply replace cadres, kick them away, or mistakenly use the method of struggling against feudal forces to struggle against cadres to mobilize the masses. This makes the cadres who have made mistakes uneasy, pessimistic, disappointed, and ideologically confused, such as fearing struggle from above and struggle from the masses, fearing revenge from landlords and feudal forces, and fearing dissatisfaction from their families. They do not know what the way out is, and lose their bright future, so that some cadres who have made mistakes show abnormal psychology and behavior, such as passive work, complaining, losing their temper, drinking, gambling, violating laws and disciplines, and other behaviors. Of course, the cadres themselves who have made such serious problems should be responsible, but the responsibility of the leading organs and leaders is even more serious. If this serious problem is not well resolved and thoroughly transformed, our Party's tasks such as production and disaster relief, revolutionary war, etc. will not be possible to carry out, and may even lead to failure.

Comrade Zhang Dingcheng further pointed out that the following points must be firmly grasped in carrying out the work of reorganizing cadres:

First, leading organs, organizational departments, and leading cadres must earnestly implement the guiding principles and policies of "cherishing, educating, uniting, and transforming." First of all, they must examine whether their own cadre policies and mental attitude towards cadres are correct. We must believe that our cadres are cultivated in the revolutionary struggle, and they support the revolution and the Party's line and policies. Mistakes can be corrected. In the past, our Party relied on the vast number of cadres to mobilize and organize millions of people, and shouldered extremely arduous tasks such as the War of Resistance, the revolutionary war, and land reform. Now and in the future, we still have to rely on our cadres to complete the Party's tasks, all the way to leading the people to complete liberation. Therefore, we must care for and cherish cadres. For Party member cadres who have done the work correctly and have achievements and merits, they must be promoted and rewarded. For Party member cadres who have made mistakes and shortcomings in their work, we must adopt a critical and resolutely transformational attitude. However, the leadership must realize that in the past, they did not care enough about cadres, especially the lack of education in Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and policies, and the lack of guidance and help for cadres to improve, which caused cadres to make serious mistakes today. They have not assumed their due responsibility for educating and transforming cadres. Therefore, the leadership must sincerely make self-criticism to the cadres, guide the cadres to criticize and self-criticize, so that the cadres can sincerely recognize their mistakes, correct their mistakes, and actively work.

Second, the cadres themselves must face up to their mistakes and be brave in correcting them. All our cadres must believe that the Party attaches importance to the role and achievements of comrades in the revolution, and will never abandon any revolutionary cadre. They should believe that the Party cherishes our cadres, and adopts an attitude of education, transformation, and treating diseases to save people towards cadres who have made mistakes. The East China Bureau has already pointed out that the main responsibility for the past mistakes lies with the leadership, and does not excessively blame the lower levels. However, we cadres ourselves must realize that those mistakes such as selfishness, corruption, coercion, and alienation from the masses are also the responsibility of our cadres themselves. Therefore, we must first strictly examine ourselves, face up to our mistakes, deeply reflect, resolutely correct our mistakes, and constantly conduct criticism and self-criticism to encourage ourselves, humbly learn, and actively improve our Party spirit and work ability, so as to be selfless and serve the people wholeheartedly. To achieve this goal, we must have the Party's guidance and supervision, and obtain the help and supervision of the masses, constantly listen to the voices and criticisms of the masses, and be brave in correcting our mistakes in our actual work.

Third, reorganizing cadres must be closely linked with uniting the masses. The cadre problem is a very important issue related to the people. Therefore, to correctly solve the cadre problem, the leadership must be combined with the masses, and must obtain the help of the masses. That is to say, we must also go through mass democracy to examine and select cadres, and let the masses participate in the democratic criticism and review of cadres. Leading organs and leading cadres should not cover up the mistakes of cadres with a sectarian attitude. They must guarantee the realization of the democratic rights of the masses, and prohibit the criticized cadres from retaliating against the masses. At the same time, they must widely publicize the guiding principles of "cherishing, educating, uniting, and transforming" to the masses, and make the masses realize that cadres have made mistakes in revolutionary work, in addition to being responsible themselves, some are because they do not understand the correct way to do things and have made mistakes, and some are the responsibility of the higher levels. They should use the attitude of "treating diseases and saving people" to criticize and educate cadres and help cadres correct their mistakes. They should never treat our cadres who have made mistakes with the attitude and methods of treating class enemies. Otherwise, it will not achieve the purpose of unity and transformation, and will cause disunity and even confrontation within us, and there is a danger of landlords and bad elements taking advantage of the situation.

Fourth, we must enforce strict discipline, and rewards and punishments must be clear. Our cherishing of cadres is for the sake of cherishing the people, and the masses' cherishing of cadres has principles and disciplines. For those who have committed serious mistakes, or knowingly violated Party and revolutionary discipline, and still stubbornly cling to their mistakes after education, and do not correct them, or say one thing and mean another, and have a two-faced attitude, and have failed the Party's and the people's enthusiastic hopes for them, they must be subjected to Party discipline, and given necessary and appropriate punishment according to the nature, degree, and cause of their mistakes, until their work is revoked or even their Party membership is revoked. And for those who are actively responsible for the Party and the people, and cadres who have achievements and merits, they must be commended and rewarded. Only with strict discipline and clear rewards and punishments can we protect the ideological, political, and organizational Bolshevik consistency of our Party and make us have unlimited combat effectiveness.

Fifth, in actually dealing with the problem of cadres' mistakes, we must have a pragmatic, realistic, friendly, and united mental attitude. The occurrence of cadres' mistakes has its certain historical roots and ideological roots. The leadership should not be impatient, hasty, simple, one-sided, or adopt a bureaucratic attitude when dealing with problems, but should investigate and study according to the specific circumstances of each individual and each organization, analyze the root causes, nature, and harm of their mistakes, and point out ways to correct them, and patiently and earnestly persuade and educate them, open up their minds, and help them transform their mistakes, so that they will not repeat these mistakes. We are serious and resolutely transformational about comrades' mistakes, but we are also enthusiastically caring for comrades who have made mistakes. Therefore, as long as any comrade who has made a mistake recognizes his mistake and corrects it, he should not be prejudiced against him, and he should be united with him to work well. In the present, they must be assigned certain work in production and disaster relief to test whether they have corrected their mistakes. Even for those who have committed serious mistakes and must be disciplined, they must also be treated with humanity and utmost care. Leading organs and leading cadres must have a good grasp of Chairman Mao's spirit of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, treating the illness to save the patient, opening up the mind, and uniting comrades," implement the spirit of cherishing, and achieve the goal of unity. On the part of the cadres themselves, they must resolutely and thoroughly correct their mistakes, respect the leadership, and obey the organization.

Sixth, we must be vigilant against class alien elements and enemies who have infiltrated our ranks, and strictly prevent them from taking advantage of loopholes to carry out sabotage activities. We must resolutely cleanse these people to protect the purity of the Party and revolutionary organizations. In reorganizing cadres, we must distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, thoroughly and responsibly, but also cautiously, clarify their true political features, and must not treat cadres of landlord and rich peasant composition as class alien elements, because for cadres of landlord and rich peasant composition, as long as they are willing to serve the people and stand on the position of the proletariat, we also adopt the guiding principles of cherishing, uniting, educating, and transforming. The so-called class alien elements refer to those who have not abandoned their original exploiting class position and have mixed into the Party and revolutionary organizations in order to achieve their purpose of speculation and wrongdoing, and who refuse to be transformed. The so-called enemies who have infiltrated our ranks refer to those who are sent by counter-revolutionary organizations to our revolutionary organizations to carry out concealed sabotage activities. If the above two types of people are found, the facts must be investigated, with sufficient materials, and reported to the higher authorities for approval and handling, so that we can both eliminate the enemy and consolidate ourselves.

Finally, Comrade Zhang Dingcheng said: We must deeply realize that the ideological and political transformation of cadres is a long-term process of struggle and education. We should never put aside the current tasks and detach ourselves from reality to rectify the ideology and organization of cadres. This will not only fail to rectify the ideology of cadres, but also abandon the current work. Therefore, leaders and leading cadres at all levels must boldly believe in and use the original cadres to carry out their work, especially today's production and disaster relief work, and implement the guiding principles of cherishing, educating, uniting, and transforming in their work, so that all cadres can work for the Party with unlimited loyalty and serve the people wholeheartedly.

　　爱护干部与改造干部
    张鼎丞同志在华东检查生产救灾干部会上的讲话
    【新华社华东十六日电】张鼎丞同志四月一日在检查生产救灾干部会上详论“爱护干部与改造干部”，他指出要解决干部问题，一、领导上必须有明确的方针政策，二、干部本身必须有正确精神态度。华东局与发现山东干部问题为华东党面前一个极端重要的问题同时，提出了爱护干部、教育干部、团结干部、改造干部的方针政策，这个方针政策是完全符合毛主席及党中央干部政策的精神的。干部本身正确的精神态度应该是毛主席谆谆教导的对党的事业对人民的事业忠心耿耿，全心全意为人民服务，大公无私；也就是季米特洛夫论干部四条标准——无限忠心、联系群众、负责工作、遵守纪律；也就是饶政委说的党性坚强的六个标准——党的利益高于一切、始终不变的坚持党与阶级的立场、高度的原则性、高度的纪律性、实事求是的作风、一切归功于党。解决了这两个方面的基本原则问题，方能保证正确解决干部问题。
    山东党对干部问题的处理，不论过去与现在一般说有正确的一方面，因而也有成绩。例如：培养了十多万干部，并依靠这批干部在八年抗战、二年人民革命战争中完成了许多艰巨任务，取得了非常多的胜利，这是值得宝贵的。可是另一方面，大多数又是违犯了上述正确原则，这就是领导上对于干部缺乏明确的方针政策，甚至于运用错误的方针政策。如：不关心干部，不注意干部理论政治水平与工作能力的提高，对干部放任自流，忽视教育培养，甚至以宗派主义的精神态度去对待干部，对干部的错误或者麻木不仁，或者姑息纵容，或者惩办主义的斗争打击，这是领导上处理干部的严重的错误。至于干部本身的精神态度也有许多严重的缺点错误，如个人主义、贪污腐化、多得土地果实，忽视党的利益与人民的利益，不虚心学习提高党性与工作能力，自以为是，强迫命令，犯了错误缺乏自我批评自觉改正。上述领导上与干部本身的错误，都必须彻底改正和解决。干部问题处理错误，就会招致严重的恶果，就会使党的干部发生思想混乱与脱离群众。例如：不少党委与领导干部中一发觉干部的严重错误，不是冷静地细心地去研究干部，不是从爱护、教育、团结、改造出发去处理，而是对干部错误的改造失去信心，甚至深恶痛绝，这也不是那也不是，因而不相信干部可以进步，不相信干部能够改造，因而简单撤换干部，一脚踢开，或错误的以斗争封建势力的办法斗争干部来发动群众。这样就使犯了错误的干部不安、悲观失望、思想混乱，如怕上级斗又怕群众斗，怕地主封建势力报复又怕家庭不满意，不知道怎样才是出路，迷失光明前途，以致一部分犯了错误的干部表现反常心理和行为、如消极怠工、满腹牢骚、发脾气、喝酒、赌博、违犯法纪等行为。这样严重的问题，当然犯错误的干部本身应负责任，可是领导机关领导者的责任就更为严重。如果这种严重问题不很好的解决彻底转变，我们党的任务例如生产救灾、革命战争等就没有可能开展，甚至可能引起失败。
    张鼎丞同志继指出进行整理干部的工作，必须切实掌握以下各点：
    第一、领导机关、组织部门、领导干部必须切实贯彻“爱护、教育、团结、改造”的方针政策，首先要检查自己的干部政策与对干部的精神态度是否正确。我们必须相信我们干部是在革命斗争中培养出来的，是拥护革命、拥护党的路线政策的，犯了错误是可以改正的。过去我们党依靠广大干部去发动与组织了千百万群众，担负了抗战与革命战争土改等极艰巨的任务，现在和将来还是要依靠我们的干部去完成党的任务。一直到领导人民彻底解放。因此，必须关心干部爱护干部，对于党员干部凡是工作正确与有成绩有功劳的必须发扬与奖励，对于党员干部在工作中犯了错误缺点又要采取批评与坚决改造的态度。但领导上必须认识到过去对干部关心不够，特别是马列主义毛泽东思想与政策教育很缺乏，对干部的指导与帮助其进步不够，以致使干部产生了今天的严重错误，对干部没有负起应尽的教育与改造的责任，因此领导上必须诚恳地向干部作检讨与自我批评，引导干部批评与自我批评、使干部心悦诚服认识自己错误，改正自己错误，积极工作。
    第二、干部本身必须正视错误并勇于改正。我们全体干部同志一定要相信党是重视同志在革命中的作用与成绩，绝不愿意抛弃任何一个革命干部的，相信党是爱护我们的干部，对于犯错误的干部是采取教育改造与治病救人的态度的。华东局已经指出过去的错误主要的由领导上负责，不过分的责备下级。但是我们干部本身必须认识那种自私自利、贪污腐化、强迫命令、脱离群众等错误是我们干部本身也要负责的。因此就必须首先严格的检讨自己，正视自己的错误，痛切反省，坚决改正错误，经常的进行批评与自我批评，以策励自己，虚心学习，积极提高自己的党性与工作能力，做到大公无私，全心全意为人民服务。要达到这目的，就必须要有党的指导与监督和取得群众的帮助和监督，经常倾听群众呼声和批评，并在实际工作中能勇于改正。
    第三、整理干部要与团结群众密切联系起来，干部问题是一个联系人民群众的十分重要的问题。因此要正确的解决干部问题就必须领导与群众相结合，就必须取得群众帮助。这就是说还须经过群众民主来考察与选拔干部，让群众来参加民主的批评和审查干部。领导机关和领导干部不应以宗派的态度包庇干部的错误，必须保障群众民主权利的实现，禁止被批评的干部向群众报复，但同时又必须向群众广泛宣传“爱护、教育、团结、改造”的方针，并使群众认识干部在革命工作中犯了错误，除自己要负责外有些是因为不懂得正确的作法而犯了错误，有些是要由上级负责的，应该以“治病救人”的态度来批评教育干部，帮助干部改正错误，绝对不应当以对待阶级敌人的态度和方法来对待我们犯错误的干部，否则既达不到团结与改造的目的，并且会造成我们内部的不团结甚至对立，有使地主、坏分子钻空子的危险。
    第四、要严肃纪律，赏罚分明。我们爱护干部是为了爱护人民，群众爱护干部是有原则有纪律的。对于那些犯有严重错误，或明知故犯，违犯党与革命纪律的人，经过教育之后仍然固执错误，不加改正，或口是心非，两面态度，辜负了党与人民对他们的热情希望，这就必须执行党的纪律，根据其错误的性质程度和原因，给以必要的适当的处分，直至撤消其工作甚至开除其党籍。而对于积极负责为党与人民工作的人，有成绩有功劳的干部，则必须给予表扬奖励。只有严肃纪律、赏罚分明，才能保护我们党的思想上、政治上、组织上布尔什维克的一致性，使我们具有无限的战斗力。
    第五、在实际处理干部错误问题时，必须具有实事求是、友爱团结的精神态度。干部的错误的产生是有其一定历史根源与思想根源的，领导上在处理问题时不能操之过急、轻率从事、简单、片面、采取官僚主义的态度，而要调查研究根据各个人各个组织的具体情况，分析其错误的根源、性质、危害性与指出改正的办法，并十分耐心地恳切地进行说服教育，打通思想，帮助其改造错误，使其不再重犯这些错误。我们对同志的错误是严肃的坚决改造的，但是对犯错误的同志又是热情的爱护的，因此对待任何犯了错误的同志只要他认识错误改正错误就不应该对他存有成见，要团结他很好的工作。在现在来说就必须分配其生产救灾中的一定工作，以考验其是否改正错误，就是对犯有严重错误，而必须执行纪律的人，也要做到仁至义尽。领导机关与领导干部必须要很好的掌握毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人、打通思想、团结同志”的精神态度，贯彻爱护的精神，达到团结的目的。在干部本身方面必须坚决彻底的改正自己的错误，尊重领导，服从组织。
    第六、对阶级异己分子和钻到我们内部来的敌人，必须提高警觉，严防他们钻空子进行破坏活动，必须将这些人坚决地清洗，以保卫党与革命组织的纯洁。在整理干部中，分清敌我界限，彻底地负责地但又要谨慎地弄清其真正的政治面目，切不可把地主富农成份的干部一律当做阶级异己分子看待，因为对于地主富农成份的干部只要他们愿意为人民服务，并站在无产阶级的立场，我们也是同样采取爱护、团结、教育、改造的方针的。所谓阶级异己分子，是指没有抛弃其原来剥削阶级的立场而混进党与革命组织中来，以达其投机取巧、为非作恶的目的，而又拒绝改造的；所谓钻到我们内部来的敌人，是指反革命组织派遣到我们革命组织中来进行隐蔽的破坏活动的人。如果发现了上述两种人，必须查清事实，有充分材料，报告上级批准处理，这样就能既肃清了敌人又巩固了自己。
    最后张鼎丞同志说：我们必须深刻的认识到干部思想上政治上的改造是要经过长时期的斗争与教育过程的，绝不应丢开当前的各项工作不做而脱离现实地去整顿干部思想整顿组织。这样既整顿不好干部思想又放弃了当前的工作，因此各级领导与领导干部必须大胆的相信与使用原有干部去进行工作，特别是今天的生产救灾工作，并在工作中贯彻爱护、教育、团结、改造的方针，使全体干部都能无限忠诚的为党工作，全心全意的为人民服务。
