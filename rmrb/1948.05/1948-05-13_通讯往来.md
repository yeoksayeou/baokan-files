    Communications to the Jinan and Hebei-Luyu Branch Offices and all Correspondents:
    For the past four months, we have received very few submissions from you. What work are you currently doing in your area? Have you discovered any past deviations in your work? Have they been corrected? What good experiences and bad lessons have you learned? How is mass production progressing? What difficulties and demands are there? All of this requires you to concentrate your efforts and, with a spirit of responsibility to the people, report promptly! Readers throughout the region are writing to us, hoping to see news from you.
     General Branch Office

    通讯往来冀南、冀鲁豫分社及通讯员同志：
    四个月来，我们收到你们的稿子很少。你区现在正做什么工作？是否发现过去工作有偏向？纠正了没有？有什么好的经验和坏的教训？群众生产如何？有什么困难和要求？这一切都需要你们集中精力本对人民负责精神迅速做报导！全区读者都在纷纷来函希望能看到你们的消息。
