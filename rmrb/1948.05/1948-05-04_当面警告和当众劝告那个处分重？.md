To the Editor:

　　When we studied the chapter on rewards and punishments in the Party Constitution during our Party Day study session, regarding punishments for individual Party members, it was divided into: "1. Private admonishment or warning. 2. Public admonishment or warning. 3. Removal from work. 4. Probation within the Party. 5. Expulsion from the Party." Some comrades believe that the order of these five punishment methods is related to the severity of the punishment. That is to say, a public admonishment or warning is more severe than a private admonishment or warning. In other words, a public admonishment is more severe than a private warning. However, some others say that this is not the case, but rather a private warning is more severe than a public admonishment, because a warning is more severe than an admonishment, and one should not mechanically distinguish based on the order of arrangement. Which opinion is correct? Please answer.

Comrade Yi Ershan:
　Regarding the severity of punishments for Party members, the chapter on punishments for individual Party members in the Party Constitution stipulates it clearly. We should act in accordance with the Party Constitution, that is, a private admonishment or warning is lighter than a public admonishment or warning (and so on). It is incorrect to disregard the order of arrangement in the Party Constitution and arbitrarily interpret a private warning as more severe than a public admonishment.

### 当面警告和当众劝告那个处分重？

　　当面警告和当众劝告那个处分重？编辑同志：
    我们在党日学习文件中，学到党章中关于奖励与处分这一章时，其对于党员个人之处分分为：“一、当面的劝告或警告。二、当众的劝告或警告。三、撤消工作。四、留党察看。五、开除党籍。有的同志认为以上五项处分办法，排列先后次序与处分之轻重有关。也就是说当众的劝告或警告，较之当面的劝告或警告是重一些。也就是说当众的劝告比当面警告为重。但又有人说不是这样，而是当面的警告较之当众的劝告为重，理由是警告比劝告重，不应机械按排列先后次序来区别。究竟那一种意见是对的呢，希答。　　　读者　易而山易而山同志：
    关于党员的处分的轻重问题，党章中关于党员个人处分一节规定得清楚，应该按照党章规定办事，即当面的劝告或警告轻于当众的劝告或警告（其余类推）。不按照党章排列次序，随便解释说当面的警告较当众的劝告为重，是错误的。
