　　Wu'an Merchant Li Dexin Writes to This Newspaper
  　Thanks the Government for Returning All Property
    [This Newspaper's News] Li Dexin, a merchant from Wu'an, fled from Wu'an to Nangong last year because he did not understand the government's policy on industry and commerce. Recently, after our democratic government returned all the property it had kept on his behalf, he has happily resumed his business. The letter he sent after resuming business is published below. To the editors of the People's Daily:
    My name is Li Dexin, and I am the manager of Da Dexin outside the West Gate of Wu'an City. I am fifty-six years old. My family was very poor when I was young. After my biological mother passed away, I was abused by my stepmother and driven out, without enough clothes to keep me warm or enough food to fill my stomach, suffering from hunger and cold, and unemployed. Later, I worked as a shop assistant in a commercial firm for eleven years, but I still could not make a living. I had no choice but to borrow a small amount of capital from relatives and friends to set up a small stall in front of Yipinzhai, selling salt and other items, for a total of seventeen years. Because I was thrifty and hardworking, and did not complain about hardship, I expanded my business with the surplus funds earned each year. Later, my business developed into a firm with a storefront, operating independently. After seven years, Wu'an City was liberated, and my business developed even further. Until 1946, the business did not develop greatly because my partners and I wasted money every day. Later, I partnered with a public store to operate in the same location. During the movement in May of last year, the masses determined that my business could not be a joint public-private venture. At that time, I did not understand the government's policy and feared struggle, so I fled to the Nangong County Tobacco Factory to work as an accountant. Since I fled, and no one was managing the business, the firm handed over all the property to the First District Office for safekeeping. After the CCP promulgated the Land Law Outline, the Nangong County government persuaded me to return home to divide houses and land. I was very happy at the time and returned to my hometown immediately. Not long after returning home, District Chief Xing and Comrade Guo Peiwen of the First District Office called me to discuss returning all my goods (worth more than four million) and 400,000 yuan in cash to me in their original amounts. Now I have officially resumed business. I now completely believe in the Communist Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce. In addition to expressing my gratitude to the government, I am determined to work hard under the Communist Party's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, and I request that the newspaper publish this statement for me. (Li Dexin)

　　武安商人李德馨投函本报
  　感谢政府发还全部财产
    【本报消息】武安商人李德馨，去年因不明政府工商业政策，由武安逃往南宫，近经我民主政府发还代其保存之全部财产后，已欣然复业。兹将其复业后的来信公布如下。人民日报馆编辑同志：
    我的名字叫李德馨，在武安城西门外大德馨当经理，现年五十有六，从小家庭甚是贫寒，自从生母去世以后，受着继母虐待，驱逐在外，衣不完肤，食不充肠，饥寒交迫，失业在外。自后在一家商号充当了十一年店员，但仍不能糊口，没法才求贷亲友微小资本，在一品斋门前摆小摊，卖食盐等物，共有十七年光景。因我节约劳动，不辞苦怨，每年所赚余资扩大经营；后来我的生意就发展成为一个字号，开设门面，独立经营，经七年以后，武安城就得到解放，我的生意更加发展。至三十五年，生意虽无大发达，是因为我和伙友们每日浪费，后来我就和公营商店公私合办，在原处开市。在去年五月运动时，群众研究我的生意不能公私合伙，当时我不明政府政策，惧怕斗争，就逃往南宫县烟厂当会计，本人逃亡，无人管理，号中即将全部财产交第一区公所保管。中共颁布土地法大纲以后，经南宫县政府，劝说我回家分房子土地，我当时很高兴，即返回家乡。回家后没有多时，一区公所邢区长和郭佩文同志就叫我商谈，将我的全部货物（能值四百多万）及现款四十万元，原数退还本人。现我已经正式营业，我对共产党保护工商业政策，从此完全相信，除向政府感激以外，我决心在共产党保护与发展工商业的政策下，努力经营，并请报馆给我登报声明。（李德馨）
