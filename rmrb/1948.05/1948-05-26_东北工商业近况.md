　　Recent Situation of Industry and Commerce in Northeast China

　　In Tai'an County, Heilongjiang, during the land redistribution last year, some industrial and commercial enterprises were infringed upon, affecting the closure of 183 shops. In March, after repeated explanations by the county government to dispel the concerns of business operators, an Industrial and Commercial Mediation Committee was established. It was stipulated that all affected industrial and commercial enterprises would receive tax reductions or exemptions within a certain period, and procedures for travel permits were simplified to facilitate merchants' trade. Within twenty-five days, 219 industrial and commercial enterprises were restored and added. The city now has 963 industrial and commercial enterprises and 1,710 stalls.

　　In Nianzishan Street, Longjiang County, Nenjiang Province, after the government declared compensation for wrongfully targeted industrial and commercial entities, thirteen large commercial firms, including 173 households, and 38 shops have begun trading, decorating their storefronts, and installing electric lights. Foundries were also supported to open with a collective investment of 5 million yuan from various merchants.

　　In Shuiquan Street, Shulan County, Jilin, after full compensation was paid to the twenty industrial and commercial households who were wrongly targeted, businesses have fully resumed operations, and ten new shops have opened.

　　In Yitong County, after the county government conducted industrial and commercial registration and abolished permits, the number of shops and stalls surged to 599, doubling the number from October last year.

　　Before May Day, employees of the Andong Electric Power Bureau completed the construction of a large-scale substation project in a certain area, twelve days ahead of the planned forty days. Andong City now has several kilowatts of additional electricity, and over 70,000 mu of paddy fields in agricultural areas such as Qianyang and Langtou have gained access to electricity for irrigation.

　　Most private factories in Harbin have exceeded their production plans. The output of Juxingcheng and Hengsheng has increased by more than 20%, while Yitai and Fuzhong have increased by more than double. Liu Xinquan, a worker at the Zhentai Iron Factory, created an automatic oil injector, saving labor and raw materials, making a significant contribution.

　　The Andong Railway Bureau of the Anpan Line held a celebration meeting in mid-April to honor 330+ meritorious individuals. Liu Chunfang, who won a major merit award, cast "water injectors" and "expansion rings" for air compressors, which are important parts of locomotives. Du Xiande, a worker in the telecommunications section, installed generators and accumulators, and manufactured substitute batteries, saving fifty batteries per month.

　　Railway workers in Harbin have created a new record of replacing one sleeper in an average of one minute and thirty-seven seconds.

　　Employees of an electric power bureau in eastern Manchuria have built eleven new substations and transformer towers. The new lines total 541,360 meters, expanding the power supply area to 46 large and small cities, and doubling the power generation.
