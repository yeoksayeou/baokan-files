[This report] Shouyang Independent Battalion saved 359,000 yuan (冀鈔 - Ji currency) to help the people in the border areas of Shouyang who suffered from Chiang Kai-shek's disasters and last year's natural disasters. The people in the border areas of Shouyang suffered severely from famine last year. Coupled with the Yan Xishan warlord army's bloody policy of seizing grain and conscripting soldiers, the masses were forced to flee to the liberated areas. This spring, we protected the masses and helped them return to carry out spring plowing. Now the masses have no food to eat. Some can only survive on gruel made from inferior grain. An old man in Yang Village was so hungry that he poured out the chaff from his pillow and ate it. Our Independent Battalion has specially saved 359,000 yuan from food allowances and is carrying out disaster relief in various villages, benefiting a total of 36 households, 113 people. After receiving relief, the masses have actively engaged in production.

    寿阳独立营节约菜金
    救济边地受灾群众
    【本报消息】寿阳独立营节约大洋（冀钞）三十五万九千元，救济寿阳边地受蒋灾和去年天灾的群众。寿阳边地群众，因去年灾荒严重，又加上阎顽军抢粮抓丁的血腥政策，逼得群众纷纷逃来解放区。今春我们掩护群众回去进行春耕，现群众都没粮食吃，有的只能二谷面糊糊渡命。杨村一个老汉饿得把枕头里秕谷也倒出来吃了。我独立营特节约下菜洋津贴三十五万九千元，到各村实行救济灾民，受救济的共三十六户，一百一十三人。经过救济后，群众都纷纷积极闹生产。
