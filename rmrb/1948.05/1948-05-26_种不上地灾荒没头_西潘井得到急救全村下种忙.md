　　“If You Can't Plant, Disaster Will Be Endless”
  　Xipan Well Receives Emergency Relief, Whole Village Busily Plants
    [Ji-Lu-Yu News] Xipan Well in the Second District of Gaoling has a total of 97 households: 2 rich peasant households, 10 middle peasant households, and 80 poor peasant households, totaling 408 people. The village is all sandy land, and it has suffered from floods for two consecutive years. Coupled with the enemy's looting and destruction at the end of last year, this has resulted in a severe famine this spring. Before the loans, 75 households in the village went out to beg for food. Those who remained at home mainly survived by eating tree leaves and wild vegetables. Most of the trees around the village were cut down and exchanged for food, and houses were used as firewood. Of the village's nine livestock, two donkeys had already starved to death due to lack of fodder, and five of the remaining seven were unable to work. The masses were preparing to flee the famine. After learning about this situation, the government urgently allocated more than 1,500 jin of relief grain and 1.05 million yuan in loans. 44 households received relief grain, and 85 households received loans. After the loans and grain were distributed, the masses reflected, "If we hadn't received loans and grain, our village would have ended up like that year (referring to the spring famine of 1943), with everyone fleeing or starving to death." As for the work-for-relief, the masses in this village transported more than 20,000 jin of public grain, receiving 12 jin of rice for every 100 jin transported, totaling more than 2,400 jin of rice. Three women, including Liu Xianglian, also actively participated in transporting grain. Some said, "Transporting grain this year is a really big deal. If we had just received a little relief grain, it would have been eaten up long ago." After receiving loans and grain, the masses have a very high enthusiasm for production. Because this village has very few livestock, men, women, old and young all went to the fields. Their slogan is: "If you can't plant, disaster will be endless." The whole village is actively engaged in spinning and weaving for spring plowing. Children climb trees to pick leaves and pull plows, transport rice, and free up men to transport grain. They are all voluntary mutual aid groups of two or three families. In addition to picking leaves and participating in spring plowing in the fields during the day, the women also have to spin and weave at night. For example, Wen Ta Niang actively participates in spinning and weaving while taking care of her children. Even under these extremely difficult conditions, one-third of the village has now been planted. The masses are actively trying to save themselves and automatically planting more early-maturing melons and vegetables. A total of more than 100 mu have been planted in the village.

　　“种不上地灾荒没头”
  　西潘井得到急救全村下种忙
    【冀鲁豫消息】高陵二区西潘井，全村共九十七户，富农二户，中农十户，贫农八十户，共有四百零八口人。该村都是沙地，二年来连遭水灾，加上敌人去年年关的抢掠破坏，造成了今春的严重灾荒。没贷款前，全村出去要饭者七十五户，在家的主要靠吃树叶子和野菜过活，村周围的树大部被砍掉换了粮食吃，房当柴烧。全村九个牲口，因没有草料，已饿死了两个驴，剩下的七个有五个不能干活，群众都准备逃荒。政府了解这种情况后，急拨救济粮一千五百多斤，贷款一百零五万元，吃救济粮者四十四户，得到贷款者八十五户。贷款贷粮后，群众反映说：“要不贷款贷粮，俺这村又得和那年一样（指四三年春荒），都得逃光，不逃都得饿死”。以工代赈救济，这村群众运公粮二万余斤，每百斤得米十二斤，共可得米二千四百多斤，刘香莲等三个妇女，也积极参加运粮，有的说：“今年运粮真顶了大事，要光发点救济粮早就吃完啦。”贷款、贷粮后，群众生产劲头很高，因这村牲口很少，所以男女老幼齐上地，他们的口号是：“种不上地灾荒没头”。全村积极纺织春耕，小孩上树采叶子，拉犁拉耧送米，腾出男的来运粮，都是两家三家自愿结合的互助着。妇女们除白天到地里采叶子参加春耕外，晚上还得纺花织布，如文他娘带着孩子还积极参加纺织。就在这极端困难的条件下，现全村已种上十分之三。群众都正积极想法自救，自动多种早熟的瓜菜，全村共种一百余亩。
