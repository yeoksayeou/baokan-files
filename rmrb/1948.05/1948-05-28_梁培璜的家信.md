Liang Peihuang's Family Letters

After Liang Peihuang was captured, he wrote letters to his wife and youngest son. His son, Liang Jiaxiang, is a teaching assistant in the Department of Biology at the College of Science, Tsinghua University in Beiping, and currently resides at No. 35, Xinxin South Courtyard, Tsinghua University. His youngest son, Liang Baoxiang, is still in Linfen City. His original letters are as follows:

(I) To his son: I have arrived at the rear of the People's Liberation Army for rest. I am receiving generous treatment from the People's Liberation Army and am currently safe. Do not worry. You may also briefly inform other relatives. Also, tell Chunyi and Luolian: if you find Mr. Li returning home, you should help him properly. I won't write more, wishing you well. Pu, May 21st (Note: Liang Peihuang's courtesy name is Taipu)

(II) To his relative Baoshen: I have arrived at the rear of the People's Liberation Army for rest and am very safe. Do not worry. You, the old lady, the sick, and the children should request the municipal government to issue an official letter and return to your home in Nangong. With the official letter, you can request land for cultivation. If you absolutely cannot leave, tell the truth in Linfen and ask the municipal government to give you land to cultivate and provide relief for the sick. I have asked someone to take care of you. If you decide to return to Nangong, and the sick cannot travel with you, I can ask Mr. Zhang of Yanling Hospital to take the young woman with the sick and send them to his hospital for treatment. Please ask him to be compassionate and take them in, otherwise your family will have no way out. According to the regulations of the People's Government: the families of captured officers who wish to return home will be assisted with travel expenses if they do not have enough. Those who have no home to return to will live as ordinary people and receive relief if they cannot make a living. Therefore, after the patient is hospitalized, the hospital can also apply to the Linfen City on their behalf for relief. Wishing you well.

Huang, May 21st

　　梁培璜的家信
    梁培璜被俘后，写给他的妻子和小儿子的信，他的儿子梁家骧在北平清华大学理学院生物学系任助教，现住清华大学新新南院三十五号。他的小儿子梁保骧，现在还在临汾城。他的原信如下：
    （一）给他儿子的说：我已到达解放军后方休息，蒙解放军多方优待，刻下平安，不必悬念。其他至亲方面，亦可便中略告。另告纯一、萝莲：如访得李先生返家，应妥为帮助。余不一一，即祝近吉。璞于五月二十一日（按：梁培璜字太璞）
    （二）给他亲戚保身的信：我已到达人民解放军后方休息，甚为平安，不必悬念。你同老太太病人和小孩等，最好是请求市政府开公事，仍回南宫家中，凭公事就能要地种。如万一不能走，在临汾只有说实话，请市政府给地种，对病人请救济，我已托人关照你们。如决定回南宫，病人无法跟着走，我固可求求延龄医院的张先生，把小女子跟上病人送到他医院里疗养，请他务必慈悲收留，不然你一家人没办法。按人民政府规定：被俘军官之家属，愿回家的回家，路费不够的帮助，无家可回的、安分当老百姓，不能生活的救济，所以病人住院后，也可由院向临汾市代请救济，即询近吉。　　　　　璜启　五月廿一日
