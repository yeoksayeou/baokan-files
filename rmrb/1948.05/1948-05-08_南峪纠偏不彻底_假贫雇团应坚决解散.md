【Taiyue News】 The Nanyu Village in Yangcheng County abolished the fake Poor Peasant League leader, lifted the control over middle peasants, overcame the chaotic situation, and the masses began to concentrate on production. Last winter, when issuing winter production loans, Nanyu Village wanted to organize a "Poor Peasant League." Bad element Li Guocheng took the opportunity to infiltrate and organized a group of bad cadres who had been previously removed from their positions to serve private interests through the "Poor Peasant League." Li Fahua used to be the village chief but was removed for corruption, and Li Degui used to be the vice chairman of the Farmers' Association but was also dismissed for corruption. When electing the leader of the Poor Peasant League, this group of people privately discussed and put Li Guocheng forward. Their method of developing "Poor Peasant League" members was to recruit relatives and friends. Although there were some genuine poor peasants inside, they were mostly honest people who could be manipulated by them, used as a facade. In the Nanyu Village with 357 households, they organized 50 households, including 13 middle peasants and one rich peasant. As soon as they came to power, they sealed the doors of 15 middle peasant households and controlled four middle peasant households, arbitrarily deducting from and beating peasants. When martyr's family member Li Xiaofeng said, "The rich speak with a booming voice, the poor speak and no one listens," Guocheng heard it and had her beaten at a women's meeting, saying, "We will search your bones!" This caused unrest in the whole village, and production could not be carried out. Zhang Xiaochong had ten mu of land that had not been fertilized. The masses called Li Guocheng "Master Guocheng." After the work team came to the village and understood the above situation, they publicly publicized the policies, read newspapers, and explained the instructions of the Central Bureau to the Taiyue District Party Committee one by one. They especially emphasized that middle peasants must not be infringed upon, and those who have been infringed upon should be compensated. In this way, the masses' anxieties were slowly relieved, and they happily said, "What the newspaper says is really good, it matches our village." Then, they began to solve the biggest problem in the masses' minds: dealing with the fake poor peasant leader Li Guocheng. At a mass meeting, many people burst into tears, raised 36 opinions to Li Guocheng, and demanded his removal. The work team accepted the masses' demands and announced the removal of Li Guocheng from his position as the leader of the Poor Peasant League. Only then did the masses feel relieved. In order to make the masses truly understand the principle of uniting with the middle peasants, a Poor Peasant Congress was held, proposing to lift the control, open the sealed doors, and compensate the losses of the middle peasants. The vast majority of poor peasants originally opposed reckless actions and agreed to do so, so the doors were opened smoothly, and the control over middle peasants was lifted. Poor peasant Li Fengan used the example of "one arrow is easy to break, ten arrows are hard to break" to illustrate that middle and poor peasants must unite. The confiscated felt and quilts from the middle peasants were returned, and the masses' emotions turned around at once. It used to be lifeless, but now it has become joyful. Middle peasant Xiao Hong said, "I am as happy as a child during the New Year." Middle peasant Li Xiaotu said, "Listening to the policies and laws, people are full of energy!" Middle peasant Li Tianbao said, "The work team really knows how to cure diseases, and they have cured both my internal and external illnesses." Poor peasant Wu Xiaoshuang also said, "What the newspaper says is really coming true, I am so happy that I can shout more today." Now the whole village is working with full energy on production. All 1,200 mu of millet and cotton fields have been planted, seven-tenths of the wheat fields have been weeded, and most of the fertilizer for the corn fields has been delivered. Some of the masses have finished their work in the fields and are taking the time to transport goods.

From the above situation, the "Poor Peasant League" in Nanyu Village was not established after a democratic class division, and its composition must be impure. According to the bad role and bad influence it played in the village, it should not only be a matter of removing or dismissing the league leader (which would mean that the work team recognizes this "Poor Peasant League" but only thinks that the "league leader" is not good), but it should be resolutely dissolved or its activities should be stopped. Simply removing or dismissing the league leader now cannot guarantee that the league will become better in the future. In addition, the announcement of lifting the control over middle peasants and opening the wrongly sealed doors should not only be announced at the Poor Peasant Congress, but the middle peasants should also be gathered together to announce it. Only in this way can the middle peasants feel that they also have the same democratic rights.

### 南峪纠偏不彻底　假贫雇团应坚决解散

　　南峪纠偏不彻底
  　假贫雇团应坚决解散
    【太岳消息】阳城南峪村撤消假贫雇团长，取消中农管制，克服了混乱现象，群众开始安心生产。去年冬天发放冬季生产贷款时，南峪村要组织“雇贫团”。坏分子李国成便趁机钻入，把一伙过去被撤职罢免的坏干部都组织起来，拿“雇贫团”来为私人服务。李发华过去当过村长，因贪污被撤职，李德贵当过农会副主席，也因贪污被罢免。选举雇贫团长时，就是这一伙人私下商量好了，就把李国成抬出来。他们发展“雇贫团”员的办法，是亲戚拉亲戚，朋友拉朋友。虽说里面也有些真雇贫，但都是些能听他们摆布的老实人，用来做个招牌。在这三百五十七户的南峪村里，他们组织了五十户。内有中农十三个，富农一个。他们一上台，就封了十五家中农的门，还管制了四户中农，随便扣打农民。抗属李小凤说了一句“富人说话有哄声，穷人说话没人听”，被国成听见了，就抓在妇女会上打了一顿。还说：“要搜你的骨头！”闹的全村人心不安，生产闹不起来。张小虫有十亩地没上粪。群众把李国成称为“国老爷”。工作队到村了解了上述情况后，便公开宣传政策，读报纸，将中央局给太岳区党委的指示一条条解释。特别说明坚决不侵犯中农，侵犯了的要补偿。这样一来，慢慢解除了群众的心病，高兴的说：“报上说的真好，跟咱村的对对的”。接着便开始解决群众心上顶大的问题：处理假贫农团长李国成。群众会上，许多人放声大哭，向李国成提出三十六条意见，要求罢免李国成。工作队接受群众要求，宣布撤了李国成雇贫团长的职，这样，群众才算出了一口气。为了使群众真正懂得团结中农的道理，便开了一个雇贫大会，提出解除管制，开被封的门，补偿中农损失。绝大多数雇贫原来就反对蛮干，都同意这样做，便顺利的开了门，取消了管制中农。贫农李逢安以“一支箭易折，十支箭难折”的例子，说明中贫农一定要团结。没收中农的毡和被子原物退还，群众情绪一下子就转过来了。以前死气沉沉，现在变成喜气盈盈。中农小红说：“我象小娃过年一样高兴。”中农李小土说：“听了政策法令，人都有劲了！”中农李天保说：“工作队真会治病，内外病都给我看好了。”贫农武小双也说：“报上说的真来，喜的我今天能多圪嚷。”现在全村生产已干的一股劲。一千二百来亩谷子、棉花地都已种齐，麦地锄了十分之七，玉茭地的粪也已送了一大半。有的群众把地里活做完，又抽空出去运输了。
    从上面情况看，南峪村的“贫雇团”，并不是经过民主划阶级后成立起来的，其成份必然不纯；按其在村中所起的坏作用、坏影响，应该不仅是撤消或罢免团长的问题（这样就表示工作队是承认这个“贫雇团”的，只是“团长”不好而已），而是干脆解散或停止其活动的问题。现在这样撤消或罢免一下团长，并不能保证以后该团变好。另外，宣布取消中农管制，开错封的门子，也不应该只是在贫雇大会上宣布，而应该把中农也召集在一起宣布。这样才能使中农感到自己也有同样民主权利。
