　　Further Improve Troop Tactics
  　A Unit in Wanxi Conducts Combat Review
    [Xinhua News Agency, Wanxi Front, 17th] Frontline reporter Yu Chengde reports: In the Zhenping battle, a certain unit conducted a combat review. After the battle, the unit had the Sixth Company, the main attacking force, give on-site reports in segments according to their original combat positions and actions. At this time, the battalion commander paid attention to the company commander's command, the political instructor paid attention to the political work of the instructor, while the company commander paid attention to the timing of attacks and the soldiers' actions, and the instructor paid attention to what work should be done at what time. In the exercise, the demolition team leader first destroyed the enemy's landmines. Zheng Wangchun took the new recruit Chen Daqing and ran nimbly to the front. Zheng said, "Pull!" The landmine exploded. At this time, the enemy discovered them and threw three grenades. Zheng said, "Crawl down!" Chen followed the shout and just as he went prone, the grenades exploded. Zheng shouted again, "Run!" and the two safely completed their mission and returned. Everyone thought the actions were good, especially that the new recruit didn't suffer by following orders. Next, the demolition group practiced blasting a hidden bunker. Squad leader Yan Tianshun of the Fifth Squad was very determined to complete the task, but his technique was not skilled. He placed the explosives but couldn't light them after six or seven tries. But they were very calm and finally lit them. Everyone commented, "If the firepower hadn't been good at suppressing the enemy, they wouldn't have been able to complete the task." Some said, "The main thing is to be calm." Others said, "Technique must be skilled to ensure completion of the task." After the hidden bunker was destroyed, squad leader Hu Zhanyuan of the attacking force's Fifth Squad led the first half of the squad up, but two new recruits in the second half did not follow. So everyone asked them why they didn't go up. Wei Wangli said, "I just joined the army, and a bullet almost hit me in my first battle, so I didn't dare to go up." Li Yongshan said, "I saw a lot of enemies and was afraid to go up." At this time, everyone said, "The main thing is lack of experience, and the squad's work hasn't been done well." Then another soldier ran back to report, "The enemy's suppression is very heavy in front, and we can't hold it off." Everyone looked at the terrain, and hand grenades couldn't reach, and machine guns couldn't hit, so they said, "The main thing is not being calm." After reporting to the end of the battle, a review was conducted from top to bottom, and everyone felt that this method made it impossible to bury good points and impossible to hide bad ones. Qi Baolu, the company commander of the Sixth Company, said, "In the past, when we reviewed and reported, we just made vague gestures, and we couldn't figure it out even after half a day, but now everything is clear. At the same time, I feel that evaluating merits and recording merits is very easy, and the assessment of casualties is clear at a glance." The soldiers' feeling is, "Even a small mistake is costly." Now the unit is planning to conduct another on-site exercise based on the shortcomings identified in the review to further improve the troops' tactics.

　　更进一步提高部队战术
  　宛西某部进行实战检讨
    【新华社宛西前线十七日电】前线记者于成德报导，镇平战斗中，某部进行实战检讨。该部将主攻六连于战后按照原来战斗位置和动作，分段进行实地汇报。这时营长注意连长的指挥，教导员注意指导员的政治工作，同时连长则注意出击时机、战士动作，指导员便留心什么时机应进行什么工作。演习中首由破击组长破坏敌人的地雷，郑旺春带着新战士陈大庆动作敏捷的跑到前沿跟前，郑说：“拉”，地雷炸了，这时敌人发觉，投出三个手榴弹。郑说：“爬下”，陈顺着喊声在刚伏到地上手榴弹就炸了。郑又喊一声“跑”，两个人安全的完成任务归来。大家都认为动作好，尤其是新战士听指挥不吃亏。接着是炸药组演习炸破暗碉。五班阎天顺完成任务的决心很大，但技术不熟练，放好了炸药六七下都没有燃着，但他们很沉着，终于燃着了，大家评论说：“要不是火力封锁得好，也完不成任务，”有的说：“主要是沉着，”又有的说：“技术一定要熟练才能保证完成任务。”暗碉炸毁后，攻击部队五班长胡占元带领着上半组上去了，下半组有两个新战士没有跟上去。于是大家问他们为什么不上。魏旺力说：“我才参加部队，头一次打仗中有一颗子弹差一点把我打中，我不敢上。”李永山说：“我看见敌人很多就不敢上了。”这时大家说：“主要是没有经验，班里的工作也没有作到。”接着又有一个战士跑回来报告说：“前边敌人封锁得很厉害，挡不住。”大家去看他的地形，手榴弹投不到，机枪打不着，于是说：“主要是沉不住气。”汇报到战斗结束，又从上至下进行检讨，大家都觉得这办法使好的埋没不了，坏的隐瞒不了。六连连长祁保卢说：“以前检讨、汇报时，连比带划，大半天也闹不清，如今什么都明白了。同时觉得评功、记功很省事，伤亡评定一看便知。”战士们的感觉是：“有一点差错便吃亏。”现在该部正计划根据检查的缺点再作实地演习，进一步提高部队的战术。
