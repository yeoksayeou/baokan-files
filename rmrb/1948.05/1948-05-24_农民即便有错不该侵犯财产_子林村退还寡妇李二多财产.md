　　Farmers Shouldn't Infringe on Property Even if Someone Is Wrong
  　Zilin Village Returns Property to Widow Li Erduo

    [Jinan News] In Zilin Village, First District of Zhendong County, there is a woman named Li Erduo, a middle peasant. Because her husband died the year before last, she has been living as a widow. Her reputation isn't very good, and some people dislike her. The militia detained her and confiscated all her property (four mu and seven fen of land), furniture, clothing, etc., and drove her out of her home. The militia divided up her belongings and forced her to remarry within half a month. She was driven out of the village and went to live with her family in Liuhu Village. Li Erduo heard that middle peasants should not be struggled against, and that poor and middle peasants are one family, so she went to the county government to appeal her grievance. The county government sent people to investigate and confronted the village cadres to find out the truth. They sent cadres back to the village to let the masses handle the matter. The militia and village cadres admitted that they should not have struggled against her property and declared on the spot that all the property would be returned. Both sides were satisfied.

　　农民即便有错不该侵犯财产
  　子林村退还寡妇李二多财产
    【冀南消息】振堂县一区子林村，有一个妇女叫李二多，是个中农，因为前年男人死了，寡居一人，为人不很好，有些人看她不顺眼，民兵就扣起她来，把全部家产（四亩七分地），家具衣裳等等）没收，扫地出门，民兵分了，逼迫她半月以内改嫁，被赶出村去，就往六户村娘家住。李二多听说不能斗中农，贫中农是一家，就到县政府诉冤，县政府一面派人调查，一面调村干对质，弄清真情，派干部回本村交群众处理。民兵村干承认不该斗她的财产，当场声明财产全部退还，双方都满意。
