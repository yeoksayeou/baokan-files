May 3rd to 9th
    Following the joint conference of representatives of democratic parties and groups from North and South Korea, leaders of thirty-one major political parties and people's organizations from North and South Korea convened in Pyongyang at the end of last month. They resolved not to recognize the upcoming fraudulent election in South Korea and the resulting separatist government. They announced that once foreign troops withdraw, they would immediately organize a provisional democratic government to guarantee peace and order, and prepare for democratic general elections to establish a unified People's Democratic Republic. Meanwhile, the provisional session of the North Korean People's Assembly, with representatives from South Korea participating, unanimously passed the draft constitution of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. This draft constitution embodies the true aspirations of the Korean people; it satisfies the people's demands for unification and independence, democracy, peace, land, an eight-hour work system, and the nationalization of large industries. Despite the US imperialist occupation authorities' shameless use of violent suppression, deception, and intimidation, the movement of the South Korean people to resist the fraudulent election is unfolding "extremely widely" (according to the Associated Press), frightening the US occupation authorities and throwing them into a panic. This close unity and heroic struggle of the Korean people demonstrates the indomitable will of all Koreans to demand independence, unification, and democracy.

    In Japan, the result of MacArthur and the Japanese reactionary government's frenzied suppression of the Japanese working people is that they have come to recognize more clearly that only the Communist Party is their savior. The Japanese working class continues to persist in its strike struggle and is responding to the anti-democratic atrocities of the reactionary authorities by joining the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). On April 26th alone, 300 people in Osaka joined the JCP. Recently, an average of 100 to 150 new members have been joining the Communist Party every day nationwide. At the end of last month, five million Japanese workers protested to MacArthur against the brutal suppression of the strikes, demanding the immediate release of those arrested.

    On the 3rd, the Soviet Union issued the third series of reconstruction bonds worth 20 billion rubles, with the aim of mobilizing people's savings to complete the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule, further prosper the socialist economy, and greatly improve people's welfare. In less than two days, subscriptions exceeded the original amount by 119 million rubles, fully reflecting the great patriotism and abundant wealth of the Soviet people.

    Over the past week, the struggle between the democratic and imperialist camps within the United States has become increasingly acute. The continuous growth of the American democratic movement has alarmed the American reactionaries, causing them to reveal their true, disgraceful faces. The notorious House Un-American Activities Committee proposed the "Subversive Activities Control Act" at the end of last month, attempting to outlaw the American Communist Party and all democratic organizations. At the same time, the US authorities carried out heinous arrests, persecutions, and intimidation against democrats. However, the result of the American reactionaries' implementation of this fascist policy is not only failing to intimidate the American people, but the nationwide wave of "struggle to defend democracy" (as called for by the American Communist Party) is rising, and it is making the reactionaries lose popular support and become increasingly isolated. The fact that the number of people opposing the Truman government has increased by 15 percent in the past six months is the best proof of this. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 朝鲜准备组织临时民主政府  日本工人阶级坚持罢工斗争

    朝鲜准备组织临时民主政府
    日本工人阶级坚持罢工斗争
    五月三日至九日
    继南北鲜民主党派团体代表联席会议后，南北鲜三十一个主要政党与人民团体的领袖。又于上月底在平壤集会，决议绝不承认即将到来的南鲜伪选及其所产生的分裂政府，宣布在外国驻军一旦撤退后，决立即组织临时民主政府，保证和平秩序，并准备民主的普选与建立统一的人民民主共和国。同时，有着南鲜人民代表参加的北鲜人民议会临时会议，已一致通过朝鲜人民民主共和国宪草。这一宪草体现了朝鲜人民的真正希望；满足了人民关于统一与独立、民主、和平与土地，以及八小时工作制与大工业国有化等要求。尽管美帝驻军当局施尽暴力镇压、欺骗威吓等无耻手段，南鲜人民抵制伪选的运动，正“极为广泛”（合众社语）的展开，吓得美驻军当局设防戒备，慌作一团。朝鲜人民的这种紧密团结与英勇斗争，说明全鲜人民要求独立、统一与民主的不屈意志。
    在日本方面，麦克阿瑟与日本反动政府对日本劳动人民肆行疯狂镇压的结果，使日本劳动人民更清楚地认识了只有共产党才是他们的救星。日本工人阶级仍继续坚持罢工斗争，且纷纷以参加日共来回答反动当局的反民主暴行。仅四月二十六日一天，在大坂参加日共的就达三百人。在最近一时期内，全国每天平均有一百到一百五十个生力军涌入共产党。上月底，并有五百万日本职工向麦克阿瑟抗议对罢工的凶横镇压，要求立即释放被捕者。
    苏联于三日发行了定额二百亿卢布的第三期复兴建设新公债，目的在于动员人民的储蓄，以便提前完成战后五年计划，更加繁荣社会主义经济，并大大提高人民的福利。公债发行还不到两天工夫，认购就已超过原额一亿一千九百万卢布，这充分反映了苏联人民的伟大爱国主义及充裕的财富。
    一周来美国国内民主与帝国主义两个阵营的斗争，已日益尖锐化。由于美国民主运动的不断壮大，惊动了美国反动派，使他们慌张地露出了儿字辈的原形。臭名昭著的众院非美活动委员会，上月底竟提出妄图使美共及一切民主组织成为非法的“破坏行为控制法”的建议；同时美当局对民主人士进行了穷凶极恶的逮捕、迫害及恐吓。但美国反动派实行这种法西斯政策的结果，不但吓唬不了美国人民，全国“为保卫民主政治而斗争”（美共号召）的浪潮反而日见高涨，而且使反动派更丧失人心而愈益陷于孤立，半年来反对杜鲁门政府的人数激增了百分之十五的这一事实，便是最好的明证。（新华社）
