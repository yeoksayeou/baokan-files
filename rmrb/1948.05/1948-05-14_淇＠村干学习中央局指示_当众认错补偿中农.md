    [Yangcheng News] After reading the Central Bureau's instructions in the newspaper, the cadres of Qi＠ Village in Yangcheng County were determined to correct their "leftist" adventurist errors. On April 26th, during the evening school session, the teacher first explained the Central Bureau's instructions in detail, clarifying the policy of firmly uniting with the middle peasants. After reading the instructions, the village instructor, Song Gaiming, immediately admitted his mistakes to everyone based on the newspaper report. He said, "Last winter, I practiced tailism, following whatever people said and going with the flow. When the Land Law Outline came down last year, many middle peasants were panicked, fearing they would be targeted, and they were feasting and drinking every day. I didn't explain anything to them at the time and simply ordered the militia to confiscate Qiao Yuting's meat buns. From that point on, we registered the grain of thirty middle-peasant households, saying that each person could only eat four or five *guan he* per day. In particular, when Yin Suo's father casually mentioned, 'I heard that Yan Xishan is old and has been replaced,' I seized on this sentence and said it was a 'special agent line,' arbitrarily labeling people as special agents—that was truly dangerous! Middle peasant Qiao Lianzong invested in the cooperative just like everyone else, but when dividends were distributed, he was excluded. That was really outrageous!" Then, the deputy instructor, Yuan Yougan, said, "During the reorganization of the militia, the director of the armed forces committee and I were undemocratic, beat two militiamen (middle peasants), and even purged them. I'm truly sorry for that!" After the self-criticism and acknowledgment of mistakes, they immediately announced the cancellation of the registrations and the lifting of the controls. Losses incurred during the registration would be compensated. The eight *jin* of cotton and three *dou* of grain confiscated from the wealthy middle peasant Yuan Yibao, and the three *shi* of grain confiscated from the middle peasant Xiao Sheng, would be returned immediately. Former members of the peasant association who had been purged would be reinstated after discussion by everyone. The practice of ordering people to sweep the floor for military dependents was immediately stopped. This series of self-criticisms and corrections of errors by the cadres of Qi＠ Village immediately boosted the morale of the masses. Old man Wang Kedun said, "Now that I've heard this report, ah! My heart is truly lighter." New middle peasant Song Baoxing said, "This is truly Chairman Mao's policy!"

    淇＠村干学习中央局指示
    当众认错补偿中农
    【阳城消息】阳城淇＠村干部看了报上登的中央局指示，下决心纠正左倾冒险主义错误。四月二十六日的夜校上，先由教员详细解释中央局指示，说明坚决团结中农政策。读完以后，村指导员宋改明当场根据报纸向大家承认错误。他说：“我去年冬天做了尾巴主义，人家说啥就是啥，顺着风走。去年土地法大纲下来，许多中农恐慌，怕轮到自己头上，一天肥吃大喝，我当时没去向他们解释，就叫民兵把乔玉廷的肉包子端了。从那时起就登记了三十户中农的粮食，说每人每天只能吃四五官合。特别是银锁父亲闲谈了一句“听说阎锡山老了，又换了人。”我抓住这句话就说这是“特务路线”，随随便便给人戴特务帽子，真正危险！中农乔联宗在合作社和别人一样入股，别人分了他没分，多出格！”接着副指导员原有干说：“在整理武装时，我和武委会主任不民主，打了两个民兵（中农），还清洗了，这真对不起人！”检讨认错以后，当场宣布取消登记，取消管制。登记时遗失的要赔偿，没收富裕中农原义保八斤棉花、三斗粮食和中农小盛三石粮食，马上归还。过去清洗的农会会员，经过大家讨论恢复。原来叫给军属扫地的立刻停止。淇＠干部这番检讨和改正错误，群众的心劲马上就提起来了。王克敦老汉说：“现在听了这报，哎呀！心真轻了。”新中农宋保兴说：“这才是毛主席的政策！”
