Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, May 28th: A Xinhua News Agency front-line reporter in the Northwest commented on the great victory of the second stage of our army's spring offensive, saying: This offensive operation, starting with the main force of our army advancing in great strides into the Jiang-occupied areas of the Jing and Wei River basins, and ending with the smashing of the counterattack of seventeen brigades of Hu and Ma's army, has resulted in pushing the Northwest People's Revolutionary War deeper into Hu Zongnan's rear. The blockade line that Hu Zongnan had built for eight years, hundreds of miles deep, to deal with the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has been abandoned behind the Northwest People's Liberation Army in this offensive. In the vast area between the Jing and Wei Rivers, the landlord reactionary armed forces on which Hu's bandits relied to maintain their rule have disintegrated. In particular, the Baoji campaign dealt a fatal blow to Hu's bandit's important military supply base for invading the Northwest. On our army's side, not only did the recovery of Yan'an and the liberation of Luochuan greatly consolidate the rear of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the newly liberated Huanglong sub-district east of the Luo River, but also a large number of weapons and materials were captured, greatly replenishing and equipping ourselves. Of particular significance is that through this offensive, the correct policies, powerful strength, and political prestige of the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the democratic government have been brought to the Guanzhong Plain, the heart of Hu Zongnan. All of these have established extremely important and favorable conditions for our army's summer offensive in the future. Since the Northwest People's Liberation Army swore an oath to march south on February 11, it has been continuously marching and fighting for three months, annihilating 50,000 enemies, equivalent to two-thirds of the total achievements of the past ten months, and the combat area is in the enemy's controlled area. This illustrates the new development of the Northwest People's Liberation War.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, May 28th: The battle in which the Northwest People's Liberation Army liberated Baoji County and the important station of Guozhen in the county from the 23rd to the 26th of last month, the battle results are as follows: Annihilated the headquarters of Jiang's bandit's entire 76th Division, the special service battalion, the engineer battalion, the entire new 40th regiment of the 144th Brigade, a part of the new 41st regiment, a part of the new 41st regiment, the 21st regiment of the pseudo-Shaanxi Provincial Security Regiment, and the Baoji Security Police Team, totaling 3,325 people (including the capture of Xu Bao, commander of the 76th Division, who died from serious injuries). Seized military materials piled up like mountains, including a military factory, several ammunition depots (including more than 30 ammunition cave dwellings), seven trains fully loaded with military supplies, one armored train, four cars, tens of thousands of shi of wheat and rice, and countless bolts of cloth. A large amount of which was distributed to relieve the local people. During the war, two commercial freight trains were intercepted, and the goods they carried were untouched and returned to the owners after inspection. When our army took the initiative to withdraw on April 28, more than 770 binoculars were moved out. According to incomplete statistics, the military materials destroyed by our army included more than 120 various cannons including howitzers, flat-shooting guns, and mortars, more than 14,000 rifles and machine guns, about hundreds of tons of various shells, about tens of millions of various bullets, more than 1,500 binoculars, 120 various gun sights, gasoline, and other military materials which were impossible to calculate.

　　西北我军春季攻势伟大胜利
  　给夏季攻势创有利条件
    【新华社西北二十八日电】新华社西北前线记者评论我军春季攻势第二阶段的伟大胜利称：这一攻势作战，由我军主力大踏步挺进泾渭流域蒋占区开始，到粉碎胡马军十七个旅之反扑为止，其结果是使西北人民革命战争更深地推进到胡宗南的后方，胡宗南修建已八年、纵深数百里的对付陕甘宁边区的封锁线，在我军这一攻势中，已被抛弃在西北解放军的后面。在泾渭之间广大地区内，胡匪赖以维持其统治的地主反动武装，已土崩瓦解，特别宝鸡一役，使胡匪侵犯西北的重要军事供应基地受到了致命的打击。在我军方面则不仅因光复延安、解放洛川大大地巩固了陕甘宁边区后方及洛河以东新解放的黄龙分区，而且缴获了大批武器物资，大大地补充与装备了自己；特别有意义的是经过这次攻势，共产党、解放军与民主政府的正确政策，强大力量与政治威信，已经带到了胡宗南心脏的大关中平原。这些均给今后我军的夏季攻势建立了极其重要的有利条件。西北解放军自二月十一日誓师南征以来，持续行军作战已达三月，歼敌达五万，等于去年十个月战绩总和的三分之二，而作战区域又是在敌人统治地区，这均说明西北人民解放战争形势的新发展。
    【新华社西北二十八日电】西北人民解放军于上月二十三日至二十六日解放宝鸡县城及该县重要车站虢镇之役，战绩统计如下：歼蒋匪整七十六师师部、特务营、工兵营，一四四旅之新四十团全部，新四十一团一部，新四十一团一部，伪陕西省保安团第二十一团及宝鸡保警队等部共三千三百二十五名（内生俘七十六师师长徐保，已重伤毙命）。缴获军火物资堆积如山，计兵工厂一座，弹药库数座（包括弹药三十余窑洞），满载军火之火车七列，装甲火车一列、汽车四辆、麦子、大米数万石及布匹无数。其中大量发放救济当地人民。在战争中，曾有商民货车两列被截获，所载货物原封未动，悉数由各货主点验领回。我军于四月二十八日主动撤出时，只望远镜一项，即搬出七百七十余具。其为我军破坏之军火，据不完全统计，计各种炮包括榴弹炮、平射炮、迫击炮一百二十余门，步马枪一万四千余支，各种炮弹约数百吨，各种子弹约数千万发，望远镜一千五百余具，各种炮镜一百二十具，汽油等其他军用物资无法计算。
