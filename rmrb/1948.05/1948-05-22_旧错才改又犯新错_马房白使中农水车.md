　　Old Mistakes Corrected Only to Commit New Ones
  　The Horse Stable is Used for Nothing, and Middle Peasants' Waterwheels are Used in Vain
    [Jinan News] Mafang Village in the First District of Ningnan is a land reform experiment village. The village has 230 households, of which 205 households are without food (including 30 households who were struggled against). Based on the urgent demands of the masses, the fruits, cotton, and grain were borrowed and distributed, and the households who were struggled against were also resettled. The enthusiasm of the masses for production increased. However, recently, when solving the problem of poor and hired peasants lacking waterwheels for watering the land, in addition to lending 11 “gua” (a unit of measurement) of fruit waterwheels to the poor and hired peasants, 19 "gua" of private waterwheels were also registered (mostly belonging to middle peasants). At the waterwheel owners' meeting in the evening, it was explained that middle and poor peasants are one family, and only through joint production can we have food to eat. Regardless of public or private waterwheels, they should be used uniformly, watering once first. Waterwheel owners should not water their land three or two times, while poor and hired peasants without waterwheels cannot even touch the water. It was decided to water the seedlings and not the old wheat, and it was also stipulated that it should be done day and night without stopping. The waterwheel owners all agreed on the surface, and then they did it this way. (Editor's note from the Jinan Daily: This kind of unified use is compulsory and does not conform to the principles of voluntary combination and equivalent exchange of labor. This will damage the interests of the middle peasants. The waterwheel owners will definitely not fully agree. We hope the work team will check and correct this.)

### 旧错才改又犯新错　马房白使中农水车

　　旧错才改又犯新错
  　马房白使中农水车
    【冀南消息】宁南一区马房村是土改试验村，全村二百三十户，断粮的有二百零五户（三十户被斗户在内），根据群众迫切要求，把果实棉花粮食借分下去，也按置了被斗户，群众生产情绪才高涨起来。但在最近解决贫雇浇地没水车的困难时，除以果实水车十一卦借给贫雇使用外，还登记私人水车十九卦（多是中农的）。晚上开水车主会，说明中贫农是一家，共同生产才有饭吃。无论公私水车统一使用，先浇一遍。不可有水车的三遍两遍的浇，没水车的贫雇摸不着。按麦浇小不浇老，又规定昼夜不停。水车主表面都赞成了以后，就这样做了。（冀南日报编者按：这种统一使用是强迫性质，不合乎自愿结合等价换工的原则，这就要损害中农利益，水车主一定不会完全同意，望工作组检查纠正。）
