    ◇ The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was released on the "May Fourth" commemorative day. The book is in a 23-size format, with paper all exquisitely made in the Liberated Areas. It has a cloth cover with gilded lettering, and a steel-engraved profile of Comrade Mao Zedong. The binding is beautiful, and the printing is of high quality. The entire book is 1,000 pages long with over 850,000 words, divided into six volumes, including 50 works by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    ◇ The fifth collection of "Democratic Northeast" has premiered in Harbin. The newsreels include "Construction Briefing," and military reports include "Victory at Gongzhuling" and "Liberation of Siping," etc. As the good news of the recovery of Yan'an arrived, the film studio rushed to produce a special news bulletin "Return Yan'an to Me," which was simultaneously shown in this collection.
    ◇ The Cultural Relics Preservation Committee recently received a large number of historical treasures, including a Song Dynasty inkstone, a relic of Yue Wu Mu (Yue Fei). Also unearthed from Baicheng (the former capital of the Jin Dynasty, Shangjing Huining Prefecture) in Acheng County were Jin Dynasty relics, Buddhist statues, coins, pots, and pans, which are of great value for historical research. Among the Qing Palace treasures are paintings from the Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan Dynasties, genuine works by Ming Dynasty artists Wen Zhengming and Tang Yin, as well as a treasured "Prosperous Suzhou" map from the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, and Song and Yuan porcelain, etc. There are also many rubbings of inscriptions on bronze and stone tablets from various dynasties. The Northeast Library has also successively acquired tens of thousands of important books, including many rare Song and Yuan editions. The library has set up a special rare book room for preservation.
