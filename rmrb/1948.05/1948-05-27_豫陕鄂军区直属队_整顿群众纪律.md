Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei, 23rd—The directly subordinate units of the Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Military Region have universally conducted education on the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. All units have carried out major discipline inspections, registered all equipment borrowed from the masses, issued receipts for borrowed items, affixed the names and addresses of the owners to the equipment, and invited the owners to personally inspect their belongings. Simultaneously, symposiums with landlords were held to solicit opinions from the masses regarding the troops. Items that were damaged or lost were compensated for at market value. The squad leader of the first squad of the ninth company confessed to secretly taking a silver bracelet from the fleeing landlord of the courtyard where they were staying, selling it for 250,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency. The person in charge of the company handed over the full amount to the Farmers' Association and apologized. To rectify discipline, a certain company specifically called on each soldier to implement a "full water jar campaign," ensuring that the landlords' water jars were always filled. Each squad also delivered a load of water to the surrounding neighbors every day. The soldiers also used the money they earned from growing bean sprouts and vegetables to buy daily necessities such as bowls, chopsticks, needles, and thread in order to minimize the inconvenience to the masses. As a result, the relationship between the military and the people in the directly subordinate units has greatly improved.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 21st—After the liberation of Weicheng, the PLA units held enthusiastic commendation rallies. During the main assault on the west city, a certain regiment cleared all obstacles, was the first to scale the four-zhang-high city wall, occupied four enemy outposts, and the soldiers fearlessly jumped from the city wall into the city, rapidly advancing into the enemy's depth, firmly holding the forward positions, and repelling many enemy counterattacks. When ammunition ran out, they engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat with bayonets and even iron shovels and pickaxes, forcing the defending bandits to lose confidence in resistance, laying the foundation for the complete annihilation of the enemy, and making a great contribution to the entire campaign. The leaders of the Corps awarded the glorious title of "Weixian Regiment" and issued a commendation order. The eighth company of the regiment, responsible for continuous blasting without any casualties, was the first to climb the city wall, opening the road to victory for the attacking troops, and was awarded the "Weixian Hero Company."

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 22nd—Frontline medical workers actively improve the reception of wounded soldiers and the work of rescuing seriously wounded soldiers. After a long march, the personnel of a certain hospital quickly built the wards upon arrival at their destination and established an alert group. A roadside lamp was placed half a li outside the village, and a large lamp was hung in front of the reception room. As soon as the wounded arrived, an alarm was raised, and all personnel immediately gathered to receive them, immediately changing dressings, washing faces, assisting with bowel movements and urination, and feeding water. Seriously wounded soldiers were given immediate first aid. As a result, it took only one hour from the time the wounded arrived at the hospital for examination, registration, dressing changes, and entry into the ward, greatly reducing the suffering of the wounded. The first branch hospital established a special rescue doctor responsible for rescuing seriously wounded soldiers. The second branch hospital established a rescue team leader and a rescue room and rescue nurses. At the beginning of the reception, a patient with malignant gangrene was discovered. After the tireless rescue efforts of doctors and nurses all night, the patient improved. The dean of the fourth branch hospital personally led all working cadres, taking turns to sit up at night and persist in their work. Many staff members of the first and third branch hospitals actively donated blood for the wounded. One comrade donated blood three times in a row, reaching 150 CC. A nurse at a certain hospital has donated 4,000 to 5,000 CC of blood.
