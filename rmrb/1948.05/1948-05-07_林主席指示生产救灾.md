Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th: Chairman Lin Boqu of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government personally inspected production and disaster relief work in various parts of the Suide sub-region earlier this month. Along the way, he investigated the masses' opinions on the government's leadership in production and disaster relief, as well as the local cadres' implementation of policies. He convened party and government cadres of Suide County to inquire about the difficulties and problems in production and disaster relief work in various places. On the 11th, he convened more than 20 responsible cadres from the sub-region's party and government, education, finance, and taxation departments to give detailed and specific instructions on the inspection and future work.

Chairman Lin pointed out that the Border Region Government's orders and instructions on production and disaster relief should be combined with the developing reality. He said, "To ensure that no one starves to death in the disaster areas and that no land is left uncultivated, the Border Region Government has called for and urged the implementation of production and disaster relief, salt transportation, and immigration. However, the number of immigrants in the Suide sub-region has reached nearly 40,000, and among the more than 10,000 people who moved to Hedong, some have already encountered difficulties in resettlement. In Yanchuan, after resettling more than 200 immigrant households, about 60 disaster-stricken households in the county had to be moved elsewhere. At the same time, in severely disaster-stricken areas such as Jiabei, Zhenchuan, Hengshan, and Mizhi counties, the excessive number of disaster victims who have moved away has greatly reduced the labor force, resulting in land abandonment."

Chairman Lin pointed out that in the future, the decision should be made to stop external immigration, and the leadership should focus its efforts on organizing mass production. Based on the specific conditions of the disaster areas, labor should be organized in a planned way to solve the difficulties of disaster victims in terms of food and seed, and to complete the spring plowing tasks. After soliciting everyone's opinions on "how many disaster victims are still there, how much relief grain has been distributed to the disaster victims, and if the decision is made not to immigrate anymore, how can the disaster victims survive the spring famine and carry out spring plowing to start this year's production movement," Chairman Lin pointed out: "These issues are still only roughly estimated by the local governments, and there is no clear understanding or practical material. If the focus of disaster relief work is shifted to organizing production in this way, difficulties will inevitably be encountered."

Chairman Lin emphasized: "The implementation of policies should combine general calls with specific guidance. Leaders should take the initiative, truly understand the situation, and master the policies. Policies must become practical as they develop with local conditions during implementation, so as not to fail. If the implementation of a policy in motion is not understood at any time and specific guidance is given directly and deeply, bureaucracy will inevitably arise." Then, Chairman Lin criticized the pompous forms of the exploiting class bureaucrats, wearing felt hats and riding pants to pose and pretend, in order to make the people awestruck and facilitate their rule. He said that in the revolutionary ranks, bureaucracy is a phenomenon caused by the poor combination of mental and physical labor. He earnestly warned the cadres present: Although many of our comrades are unwilling to be tainted by bureaucracy and prevent it at all times, if you are only satisfied with the general call of work tasks and cannot or do not pay attention to immediately conducting specific and in-depth leadership after the general call, you will inevitably put the work in danger of bureaucracy.

Chairman Lin continued to instruct on how to achieve specific leadership, saying: "Our policies are determined based on the actual situation in the Border Region and the opinions of the masses. For example, after the Border Region suffered severe damage from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, and the Northwest People's Liberation Army has entered the Chiang-controlled areas to fight, leading the masses to work hard to produce more grain, restore the people's economic life, and support the front line more vigorously is the most important policy in restoring the Border Region's construction. Allocating grain, providing loans, and immigrating for disaster relief are also for the purpose of developing production. However, I have found that governments at all levels have not fully grasped this policy, resulting in serious phenomena such as people starving and swelling and being unable to cultivate the land in some disaster areas. Therefore, all cadres at all levels of government, from commissioners and county heads to district and township workers, must study and learn the policies, and then master the policies. In order for the policies to become practical, it is also necessary to go deep into the masses to understand the situation. It should be said that many of our government leading organs do not have enough understanding of the actual situation in their jurisdiction. When the disaster victims in Zizhou went to Zhidan for the first time to transport relief grain, they did not investigate the conditions of grass and fodder along the way. They rashly mobilized 4,000 donkeys to crowd the road, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and wasting the relief grain. The Mizhi County government lacked a specific understanding of the disaster situation in various districts and had the phenomenon of evenly distributing relief supplies. Recently, the Suide urban and rural Liuxiang also evenly distributed relief grain because they did not conduct a thorough investigation. The disaster relief work in the Yan'an sub-region was better. However, when the township cadres in Yongping and Erxiang in Yanchuan distributed relief grain, they also presided over the distribution to each household evenly. These are all bad results of lacking investigation and research and not understanding the situation."

In order to have specific leadership after a general call, Chairman Lin earnestly reminded everyone: "You must study and master the policies. You must select typical cases for in-depth study within your jurisdiction, either focusing on the area or on the business, and frequently provide specific guidance to their work, understand the situation and problems in these typical cases in detail, and gain experience to guide other similar areas or the same business work. As long as the leadership is serious and specific, we have good examples, such as Luojiaping in Mizhi, which has overcome disasters through long-term mutual aid production, Haojiaqiao in Suide, which has actively cooperated with democratic movements, and Liujia Gou, which has built canals to irrigate fields and maintain soil and water, and produce more grain. These are all typical villages with a mass base. The commissioner's office and the county government must provide specific guidance, summarize and promote their experience at any time, and use it to guide various places."

Regarding the leader's initiative, Chairman Lin elaborated on the principle that military strategy must be proactive to win, saying: "Similarly, all work in the regime must also be proactive in order to exert leadership and implement policies. The more you cope, the more stretched you become, and the more complaints from district and township cadres and the masses will follow. For example, it is wrong for district and township cadres to complain about correcting deviations in the land reform. However, if the leaders can be very firm and clear, find the deviations, admit the mistakes if they are leadership errors, correct them immediately, and execute them as decided, shift the initiative to their own hands, and always pay attention to maintaining it, they will not feel confused and hesitate in the face of some essential things and phenomena. They will open up the thinking of the cadres being led, connect the masses to implement, and implement the policies."

Chairman Lin pointed out: "To grasp the initiative, you must have foresight and analysis. Only with a scientific analysis of the development of the movement, find the essence of the problem, can you have foresight and point out the correct direction, otherwise deviations will occur, or you will not dare to execute decisively. There are many similar facts in land reform. In production and disaster relief, the governments at all levels of the commissioner's office, county, district, and township worry that there will be no more relief grain after the distribution is complete, so they accumulate relief grain at all levels and dare not distribute it to the disaster victims in a timely manner to help them with spring plowing. This is a purely relief-oriented view that ignores the importance of production. The leader grasps the policy, and correcting the deviations is like the helmsman of a boat in the Yellow River, identifying the direction and paying attention to the future. If deviations are found during navigation, he firmly and swiftly turns the rudder over, so that he can lead the movement forward correctly."

　　林主席指示生产救灾
    【新华社西北三十日电】陕甘宁边区政府林伯渠主席本月上旬亲至绥德分区各地检查生产救灾工作。沿途调查群众对政府领导生产救灾的意见，及当地干部执行政策的情况，召集绥德县党政干部查询各地生产救灾工作中的困难及问题，并于十一日召集分区党政、教育、财经、税务等部门二十余负责干部，就检查所及与今后工作，作详尽具体的指示。林主席指出边府所发布的生产救灾的命令指示，应与目前发展中的实况相结合后，说：“为保证灾区不饿死人，不荒土地，边府曾对生产救灾、运盐、移民等工作作了号召，并督促进行，但目前绥德分区移民数目已近四万，而移往河东的万余人中，已经发生部分人难于安置的问题。延川因安置了移民二百余户后，致该县灾民约六十余户又不得不另移他处。同时在葭北及镇川、横山、米脂等县的灾情严重地区，由于灾民移走过多，劳力大减，又发生土地荒芜现象。”林主席指出今后决定不再向外移民，领导上应把力量放在组织群众生产上，依据灾区具体情况，有计划的组织劳力，解决灾民吃粮籽种等困难，完成春耕任务。林主席于征询大家关于“目前还有多少灾民，有多少救济粮已发到灾民手里，如果决定不再移民，怎样才能使灾民渡过春荒，进行春耕以开展今年的生产运动”等意见后，指出：“这些问题各地政府还只是笼统的估计，而没有一个明确的认识和切合实际的材料，这样如果把救灾工作的重心转入组织生产，就必然遇到困难。”林主席强调指示：“执行政策应贯彻一般号召与具体指导相结合，领导者应掌握主动，必须真正了解情况，掌握政策，必须使政策在执行中能随着当地情况的发展成为实际，才能不至落空。如不随时了解一个政策在运动中的执行情况而进行具体指导，就会产生官僚主义。”接着林主席批判剥削阶级官僚的威严形式，呢帽马裤装腔作势，是为了使人民望之生畏，便于统治，在革命队伍中官僚主义则是由于脑力体力分工结合不好而发生的现象。他谆谆告诫在座干部说：虽然我们很多同志都不愿沾染官僚主义，并时时防止它，但如果你只满足于工作任务的一般号召，不能或不注重于一般号召之后，即时直接深入的进行具体领导，就必然使工作陷入于官僚主义的危险之中。
    林主席继对怎样实现具体领导，指示说：“我们的政策是根据边区实际和群众意见而决定的。例如边区在遭受蒋胡匪帮严重侵害之后，西北人民解放军已进入蒋管区作战的情况下，领导群众努力生产多打粮食，恢复人民的经济生活，以更有力地支援前线，就是恢复边区建设中最重要的政策。拨粮贷款移民救灾，也还是为了发展生产，但我发现各级政府并未完全掌握这一政策，而致某些灾区发生饿肿了人，种不上地的严重现象。因此各级政府所有干部从专员县长到区乡工作人员，都必须研究学习政策，进而掌握政策，为了政策成为实际还须深入群众了解情况，应当说我们好多政府领导机关，对于自己所辖地区内的实际情况是了解不够的。子洲灾民第一次去志丹运救济粮，事先未调查沿路草料情形，贸然动员四千头毛驴拥挤于途，引起群众不满，致救济粮遭受浪费。米脂县府由于对各区灾情缺乏具体了解。曾发生平均分配救济物资的现象，最近的绥德城乡柳巷也因未进行确实调查，把救济粮平均分配了。延属分区救济工作较好。但延川永坪二乡发救济粮时，乡干部也主持逐户平均分，这些都是缺乏调查研究不了解情况而产生的不良结果。”为使一般号召以后能有具体领导，林主席恳切地提醒大家：“必须学习掌握政策，必须就自己所辖区内或以地区为重点，或以业务为重点，选择典型深入研究，并经常具体指导其工作，详细了解这些典型中的情况及问题，取得经验以指导其他类似地区或相同的业务工作，只要认真具体领导，好的范例我们是有的，如米脂罗家坪长期变工生产渡过灾荒，绥德郝家桥的结合民主运动积极变工，刘家沟的修渠灌田保持水土，多打粮食，都是已有群众基础的典型村庄，专署县府必须加以具体领导，随时总结及推广其经验，借以指导各地。”
    关于领导者应掌握主动，林主席以军事战略要有主动才能取胜的道理加以阐明，并说：“同样政权中的一切工作也要掌握主动，才能发挥领导力量，使政策贯彻下去，越是应付，就越是捉襟见肘，而区乡干部和群众的埋怨也就跟着来了。如土改纠偏，区乡干部抱怨是不对的，但领导者如能非常坚决明确，发现偏差。如系领导上错误即行承认错误，立即纠正，怎样决定即怎样执行，把主动权移到自己手中，并时刻注意保持它，就不会在一些本质的事物现象面前感到扑朔迷离，犹豫起来，就会打通被领导干部的思想，连系群众执行，贯彻政策”。林主席指明：“欲掌握主动，必须有预见，有分析，只有对运动的发展有科学的分析，找出问题的本质，才能有预见，指出正确方向，否则就会发生偏差，或不敢果决执行。土改中有不少同样的事实，生产救灾中，专署县区乡各级政府耽心救济粮分配完了不会再有，于是层层留积救济粮，不敢及时按照定数发给灾民，帮助灾民春耕，这是单纯救济，忽视生产重要性的观点。领导者掌握政策，纠正偏向就象黄河里摆船的舵手一样，认定方向注视前途，航行中经发觉偏差，就坚决而敏捷的把船舵搬转过来，这样就能领导运动正确前进。”
