Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th -- Liberated areas everywhere are continuing to exert great effort to overcome the spring famine caused by Chiang Kai-shek's disasters and natural calamities.

    1. State-owned shops, cooperatives, and other organizations assist disaster victims with transportation. The Taihua Trading Company in Rehe Province organized over a thousand oxcarts, charging 6% commission, to transport grain for distribution within the counties of Tianshan, Lindong, Linxi, and Jingpeng. The first shipment alone amounted to 1.6 million *shi* (石, a unit of dry measure), benefiting half of the total households in northern Rehe, and resolving the food shortage for those lacking three months of provisions (one-quarter of the total households) and the families already without food. In the second district of Taihang, state-owned shops earned 33 million *yuan* (likely referring to a local currency) transporting goods from Yuci, Taigu, and Xiyang counties last winter, enough to buy over 260,000 *jin* (斤, a unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kg) of rice. Xiyang organized disaster victims to transport military supplies, earning over 15 million *yuan* in one instance, enough to buy over 100,000 *jin* of millet. In the second district of Yu-Wan-Su (Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Border Region), counties organized disaster victims to transport 7 million *jin* of grain to the Huang-Si area. The transportation fees earned were sufficient to feed the transporters' families.

    2. Government organs and military units practice economy to aid disaster relief. Troops of the East China Military Region, the Supply Department of the Jiaodong Military Region, and the East Sea Military Sub-district have economized and donated a total of over 184,000 *jin* of grain, over 320,000 *jin* of firewood and grass, and over 9.35 million North Sea currency in vegetable funds. A certain unit of the Central China People's Liberation Army switched to eating dry rice instead of rice porridge, and corn and bean cakes instead of thin porridge, donating over 8.3 million in local currency. Xiasi and other four counties in Yu-Wan-Su have donated over 77,000 *jin* of grain. The study team of the First Military Sub-district Party Committee and the Kewe County Brigade donated materials and cash totaling over 20.26 million *yuan*.

    3. Government organs and military units provide free assistance with plowing and sowing. Over the past month, troops of the Jiaodong Military Region, the South Sea Military Sub-district, and the First Military Sub-district of Central Shandong have helped the masses plow over 5,300 *mu* (亩, a unit of area, approximately 667 square meters) of land, delivered over 19,000 cartloads and over 1,400 shoulder-pole loads of manure, rushed to plant 350 *mu*, and donated 160,000 *jin* of manure to households lacking fertilizer. Government organs and military units of the Jiaodong Military Region, the Lunan Administrative Office, the Supply Department of the Lunan Military Region, and the Third Military Sub-district of Southern Shandong formed expedition teams, providing their own tools and food, to help plow in disaster areas. Troops of the Third Military Sub-district of Southern Shandong alone plowed over 2,200 *mu* for disaster victims using human-pulled plows. The Transportation Team of the Dezhou Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce in the Bohai area also allocated 500 head of livestock to help the masses plow.

    4. The masses engage in production for self-salvation and mutual assistance. The production of saltpeter is widespread in Xiyang. According to statistics from one district, over the past winter and up to now, it has earned 70,000 *jin* of millet. Disaster victims in Qian Gorlos Banner in northern Liaoning have earned over 3,000 *shi* of grain and over 10,000 bean cakes from collecting firewood, weaving mats, and working as porters in the past month. In Caogou in Junan County, Shandong Province, the masses spontaneously organized livestock to help disaster-stricken compatriots in Shizilu village in a neighboring village. In the first district of Yu-Wan-Su, counties are resettling disaster victims by administrative village, and the masses are launching mutual aid movements such as "a bowl of rice" and "a *sheng* (升, a unit of volume) of grain." Disaster relief materials donated in Yu-Wan-Su have been distributed to disaster victims. According to statistics from the severely affected first district of Xihua, they have already received 80,000 *jin* of food, 25,000 *jin* of seeds, 13,000 *jin* of salt, 50 mules and horses, 220 taels of silver, 2 million in local currency, thousands of pieces of farm implements, and some clothing and bedding.

    克服蒋灾天灾
    各解放区节约生产自救
    【新华社陕北十一日电】解放区各地正继续以大力克服因蒋灾天灾造成的春荒。
    一、公营商店合作社等组织灾民运输。热（河）北泰华贸易公司组织牛车千余辆，按百分之六提成，运输粮食在天山、林东、林西、经棚等县内调剂，头一次就运了一百六十万石，占热北总户数一半，使缺乏三个月口粮的户和占总户数四分之一，当下已经断粮的灾民解决了食粮问题。太行二分区各公营商店去冬即组织榆（次）太（谷）昔（阳）等县灾民运输赚洋三千三百万元，能买米廿六万多斤；昔阳组织灾民运送军工器材，一次即赚洋一千五百余万元，能买小米十万余斤。豫皖苏二分区各县组织灾民向黄汜区运粮七百万斤，所得运费除自己食用外，还能养活一口人。
    二、机关部队节约救灾。华东军区部队、胶东军区供给处及东海分区已节约捐出粮食共十八万四千多斤、柴草三十二万多斤，菜金北海币九百三十五万余元。华中解放军某部改为大米干饭，改稀饭为棒子、豆饼，捐出本币八百三十多万元。豫皖苏夏邑等四县已捐粮七万七千多斤，一分区地委学习队及克威县大队所捐物资及现款共合二千零二十六万余元。
    三、机关部队无偿助耕助种。一月来，胶东军区、南海分区及鲁中一分区部队帮群众刨地五千三百余亩，送粪一万九千余车及一千四百余担，抢种三百五十亩，并赠送缺粪户大粪十六万斤。胶东军区、鲁中行署、鲁中军区供给部及鲁南三分区等机关部队都组成远征队自备工具伙食，开至灾区帮耕，仅鲁南三分区部队即以人拉犁替灾民抢耕二千二百多亩。渤海德州市工商局运输队并拨出牲口五百头帮群众耕种。
    四、群众生产自救及互助互救。昔阳各地普遍熬硝，据一个区统计，去冬到现在已赚小米七万斤。辽北前郭旗灾民打柴、编席、驮脚等，一月来已赚粮三千余石，豆饼万余块。山东莒（县）南草沟群众自动组织牲口帮助邻村十字路灾胞耕地。豫皖苏一分区各县以行政村为单位安置灾民，群众展开“一碗米”“一升粮”等互救运动。豫皖苏各地捐助救灾物资，已分发给灾民。据灾情严重的西华一区统计，已得吃粮八万斤、种籽二万五千斤、食盐一万三千斤、骡马五十匹、银子二百二十两、本币二百万元、农具数千件及衣被一部。
