Ji-Lu-Yu District Party Committee Calls on the Entire District to Arm and Defend the Wheat Harvest
[Ji-Lu-Yu News] The Ji-Lu-Yu District Party Committee issued instructions on armed protection of the wheat harvest on the 18th. The instructions pointed out that the enemy is now actively preparing for a large-scale wheat grab. The Party, government, military, and people in our border areas and guerrilla zones must fully recognize that this year's wheat harvest struggle will be more intense and fierce than in the past. It is necessary to urgently mobilize, fully organize the broad masses, smash the enemy's wheat grabbing plan, and arm to defend the wheat harvest. (1) During the wheat harvest season, all mass gatherings that delay agricultural work should be stopped. All personnel of the Party, government, military, schools, organs, and organizations should be organized to help the masses with the wheat harvest. The wheat harvest should be taken as the central task of the entire district. (2) In the border and guerrilla areas, under the unified leadership of the Party, the detachments and county and district armed forces should be organized to actively launch guerrilla warfare, in conjunction with the local masses, to strike at the enemy grabbing wheat in a planned and organized manner. Organize capable work teams to penetrate behind enemy lines, actively carry out political offensives, and publicize policies. The main task of the militia is to combine labor and military affairs to protect the wheat harvest. They should not be far from the local area, so that the interests of the militia are combined with the interests of the local masses, so as to give full play to the militia's high degree of enthusiasm. (3) It is necessary to correct the Party's various policies. In the border and guerrilla areas, due to our past mistakes in guiding principles and policies, we have indiscriminately attacked landlords and rich peasants, wrongly struggled against middle peasants, and some have been beaten and killed indiscriminately, resulting in red-white opposition in the border areas and isolating ourselves. In this wheat harvest struggle, we must lead the masses to resolutely compensate the middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, and increase the masses' enthusiasm for production. And resettle landlords and rich peasants so that they can labor and live. Strictly prohibit acts that violate policies such as indiscriminate beatings and killings and indiscriminate confiscation. Those who have not carried out land reform in the past should be stopped from now on. Only in this way can we stabilize the emotions of all strata, achieve the goal of mobilizing the masses, unite all anti-Chiang forces, isolate the enemy, and carry out extensive mass anti-enemy struggles. It is necessary to launch political offensives, widely publicize our policies to the border areas and enemy-occupied areas, expose enemy conspiracies, win over the masses, and isolate and disintegrate the enemy. Especially for the masses in the Chiang-controlled areas who are threatened and deceived by the enemy to grab wheat in our border areas, we must expose the enemy's vicious conspiracy to use the masses, organize secret societies, and create red-white opposition, mobilize the masses in the Chiang-controlled areas to borrow wheat, protect the wheat harvest, and seek unity against the enemy between the masses in the enemy areas and our areas. (4) Under the principle of voluntary combination, implement fair, reasonable, and equivalent exchange to organize the masses to help each other in the wheat harvest, and absolutely prohibit coercion and commandism. Call on and organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men, women, old and young to participate in the wheat harvest, so that the wheat harvest is combined with combat support, and the wheat harvest is not delayed due to combat support. In the guerrilla areas and border areas, it is necessary to achieve quick harvesting, quick fighting, and quick hiding, and discuss grain storage methods with the masses. (5) It is necessary to mobilize and educate village cadres to change their style of work, actively promote various organizations in the wheat harvest, lead the masses, complete the task of armed protection of the wheat, and improve relations with the masses. Party committees at all levels should combine specific circumstances, carry out in-depth arrangements, and check the implementation in a timely manner. Pay special attention to unified leadership, mobilize all forces, and carry out a resolute struggle.

    【冀鲁豫消息】冀鲁豫区党委于十八日发出武装保卫麦收指示。指出敌人现正在积极准备大规模抢麦，我边地及游击区党政军民必须充分认识今年麦收斗争将比过去更加紧张剧烈。必须紧急动员起来，全力组织广大群众，粉碎敌人的抢麦计划，武装保卫麦收。（一）在麦收时期停止一切耽误农时的群众集会，所有党政军民、学校、机关团体的人员应一律组织起来，帮助群众麦收。把麦收作为全区中心任务。（二）边沿区、游击区在党的一元化领导下，组织各分区兵团及县区武装，主动积极展开游击战，结合当地群众，有计划有组织的打击抢麦之敌。组织精干的武工队插入敌后，积极活动，进行政治攻势，宣传政策。民兵主要任务是实行劳武结合，保卫麦收。不远离当地，使民兵与当地群众的利益结合，以发挥民兵高度的积极性。（三）必须端正党的各种政策。在边地及游击区，由于我们过去在方针与政策上的错误，没有分别地普遍打击了地主富农，错斗了中农，有的乱打乱杀，以致造成边地的赤白对立，孤立了自己。这次麦收斗争中，必须领导群众坚决补偿错斗中农，提高群众生产积极性。并安置地主富农，使能劳动生活。严格禁止乱打乱杀及乱没收等违犯政策的行为。过去未进行土改的，今后一律停止。只有这样才能安定各阶层情绪，达到发动群众，团结一切反蒋力量、孤立敌人、开展广泛群众性对敌斗争。要开展政治攻势，向边地及敌占区广泛宣传我们的政策，揭破敌阴谋，争取群众，孤立瓦解敌人。特别对被敌威胁欺骗来我边地抢麦的蒋管区群众，我们必须揭破敌人利用群众、组织会门、制造赤白对立的毒辣阴谋，发动蒋管区群众借麦，保卫麦收，求得敌区与我区群众团结对敌。（四）在自愿结合原则下，实行公平合理、等价交换的组织群众麦收互助，绝对禁止强迫命令。号召与组织全劳力与半劳力男女老少一齐参加麦收，作到麦收与战勤相结合，不因战勤而误麦收。在游击区、边沿区、要作到快收、快打、快藏，要与群众商讨藏粮办法。（五）要动员教育村干部转变作风，在麦收中积极推动各种组织，领导群众，完成武装保麦任务，改善与群众关系。各级党委应结合具体情况，深入布置，及时检查执行情形。特别注意一元化领导，动员全力进行坚决斗争。
