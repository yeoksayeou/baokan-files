　　Central Bureau Directs Taihang District Party Committee
　　Inspect and Correct Left-Leaning Adventurism
　　[This newspaper's report] After studying the materials on democratic party rectification and consolidation work in various parts of Taihang, the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu (Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan) CPC Central Committee believes that the Taihang District Party Committee is determined to correct left-leaning errors, and now generally has a correct understanding of various policies. However, due to insufficient inspection and supervision, local party committees and county committees still have left-leaning adventurism in issues such as party rectification, uniting with middle peasants, and class division. Therefore, it issued the following instructions on April 27:

After reviewing the recent materials from various counties and local party committees in your district, we believe that in the past two or three months, you have been determined to implement the Central Committee's line and correct left-leaning adventurism, and your understanding of various policies is generally correct. However, because your district has always had (and other districts also have) a bad work style where resolutions and instructions are made and reports are given at the top, but there is a long-term lack of inspection and supervision (usually summarizing only every six months to a year). After receiving instructions and tasks, the bottom also has a long-term bad work style of not reporting or requesting instructions, not requesting instructions beforehand, and not reporting afterward (as was the case with your Fourth District Committee in the killings in northern Henan), so you cannot thoroughly eliminate left-leaning adventurism. The Central Bureau has instructed party committees in various districts to "take all measures to maintain close contact with the lower levels, be able to fully understand any deviations that occur in the district within a week, and be able to correct them within a week." You have not paid enough attention to this. We have studied that in the following issues in your district, left-leaning adventurism is still very serious.

(A) On the issue of party rectification, the basic mistake of some of your party committees lies in a misinterpretation of the basic situation of the Taihang party. According to our research, the basic situation of the Taihang party is: (1) The problem of impure organizational composition generally does not exist. For example, in the 15 village branches of the Ninth District of Wu'an and the six village branches of Nanguan and Taihua in She County, not a single landlord or rich peasant party member was found; the main problems are impure work style and ideology. (2) Party members generally have political experience and working ability. (3) Many cadres and party members do have many very serious problems, such as undemocratic work styles, encroaching on fruits of labor, corruption, even raping women, framing people out of spite, forming "cliques," and oppressing the masses, very much like new nobles and new despots. (4) But it is also necessary to distinguish the reasons for the mistakes. Some mistakes, such as coercive orders, beating and scolding the masses, are often due to the excessive burden of assigned tasks and the excessively tight time limits, for which the leadership should bear some responsibility. But some mistakes, such as occupying excessive fruits of labor, pursuing private gain at public expense, and corruption, are entirely due to the degeneration of party members' ideology, disobeying the party's instructions, and violating the party's decisions, for which the cadres and party members themselves should be responsible and must be resolutely corrected. Therefore, the basic principle of party rectification should be to cure the sickness to save the patient, educate through criticism and struggle, distinguish between right and wrong, and treat each case differently. Many places in your district have adopted this approach and achieved good results. However, many other places have adopted a simple approach of aversion, hatred, and blanket exclusion, denying all branch party members across the board, kicking them aside, and considering the poor peasant leagues and peasant associations to be better than the branch party. Instead of requesting the masses to offer opinions on the party and help rectify the party, they have abandoned the party's leadership and regarded the party as an appendage of the poor peasant leagues and peasant associations, allowing the poor and landless peasants to handle matters. In terms of party rectification methods, it is also not the combination of inner-party struggle and mass criticism, the combination of branch party member meetings and mass representative meetings, and the combination of strictly correcting mistakes and enthusiastically indicating a way out, as stipulated by the Central Bureau, to achieve the purpose of education and transformation; instead, it is all struggle, all handed over to the masses for handling, and handed over to the most disorganized and lowest-level form of mass organization, namely, mass meetings, to handle, which is complete tailism. Under this erroneous policy, the following serious phenomena have occurred: (1) Many village cadres, party members, and militiamen have fled, committed suicide (such as in Shahe, Pingshun, Huguan, Heshun, and Taigu counties), or become pessimistic and despondent, or collectively resisted the leadership, deepening their alienation from the party. (2) It has fueled the blind anti-party and anti-cadre sentiments of some of the masses, even saying, "Good people are not in the party, and there are no good people in the party," deepening the opposition between the party and the masses, creating a temporary state of anarchy. (3) Bad elements take the opportunity to make trouble and create factions.

In rectifying the party ranks, various localities have created many good experiences, and the method of party rectification combining branch general meetings and mass representative meetings is the most sound. The steps are roughly as follows: After the work team arrives in the village, it divides the cadres into two parts and carries out the following two tasks simultaneously: One part widely publicizes the party rectification policy and the significance of open party membership to the masses, focusing on visiting poor and landless peasants, and also visiting middle peasants, explaining that it is different from "washing faces and wiping away dirt" last year, dispelling concerns, and enabling the masses to dare to express their opinions. The other part holds branch meetings, clarifying the necessity of democratic party rectification and consolidation movement, pointing out the danger of the branch being detached from the masses, and explaining that some of these phenomena should be the responsibility of the higher authorities, and some should be the responsibility of village cadres and party members themselves. For the sake of the people's interests, this problem must be solved. Ask party members to express their opinions. After a period of brewing, after the party members and the masses are ideologically prepared, a village meeting can be convened to announce the list of party members, explain the conditions for being a Communist Party member, call on party members to accept mass criticism and review, not to allow passive absenteeism, and call on the masses to actively participate in party rectification, but not to allow physical assault. Continue brewing. The masses hold their own meetings, and village cadres and party members recuse themselves, preparing to put forward opinions on cadres, party members, and work. After all preparations are in place, representatives elected by the masses are invited to participate in the branch general meeting to help rectify the party. With the work team branch as the main body, combined with mass representatives, a presidium is formed to lead the party rectification meeting. When mass representatives put forward opinions to cadres and party members, cadres and party members can temporarily refrain from defending themselves (they have the right to defend themselves later). The leadership must let go and allow the masses to fully expose all mistakes. Under the pressure of combining mass criticism and inner-party struggle, party members are encouraged to deeply reflect. At this time, the inner struggle of party members is the most intense, and the leadership should concentrate on advocating integrity and establishing backbones. When the poor peasant league is established, some party members can be solicited to participate (usually those who dare to go are also better party members, accounting for about one-third of the branch members). Generally, they can be approved to participate in the poor peasant league and recognized as party members. When they return to the branch, they will actively oppose bad party members, and the branch will begin to differentiate. When the peasant association is established, another part of party members is solicited to participate (accounting for about one-third). Generally, they can also be approved to participate in the peasant association and recognized as party members. When they return to the branch, combined with the first batch of party members who have been approved, they will also actively oppose bad party members, and the branch will be further differentiated. The leadership relies on these party members who have been approved to further carry out inner-party criticism and self-criticism, distinguish between good and bad party members, and differentiate "cliques." This move is very important. By this point, most of the branch's problems have been resolved. The remaining part of the party members (usually about one-third of the branch, mostly incumbent cadres) find it difficult to pass, feel a lot of pressure, and have no way out. At this time, the leadership must give them warmth and comfort, explaining that as long as they thoroughly reflect and seriously correct their mistakes, there is a way out. Still, no disciplinary action is mentioned, and they must be slightly cooled down so that the unapproved party members can continue to reflect on and correct their mistakes in the consolidation. According to the experience of the Ninth District of Wu'an, under the correct leadership of the work team, most of the party members who made the biggest mistakes can consciously and voluntarily withdraw from the excessively occupied fruits of labor, improve their work style, and work actively at this time. They "would rather withdraw from land and houses than lose their party membership." At this time, the masses' anger towards them has subsided, and then a branch general meeting and a mass representative meeting are convened to allow party members to freely defend themselves, and the mass representatives make another assessment. The last batch of party members is also recognized and passed. Then, distinguish between right and wrong, and handle each case differently. In this way, the problem is solved very thoroughly, and very few are disciplined and expelled. This is how the Ninth District of Wu'an did it, and its experience generally conforms to the situation in our old district and should be adopted by various localities.

(B) On the issue of uniting with middle peasants, your district has struggled against many middle peasants for various reasons in the past. This is a principled error that must be resolutely corrected. The current policy of the district party committee is correct, but there is still resistance below and unwillingness to correct it. They say: In the past, we were not struggling against middle peasants, but against members of the puppet organization, puppet army, local bullies, and secret agents, etc. The district party committee and the local party committee should explain the issues raised so sharply to the lower levels. For example, participating in a puppet organization, the current semi-old areas were enemy-occupied areas under the long-term rule of the enemy. In order to cope with the enemy, it was sometimes unavoidable to participate in the puppet organization and should not be overly blamed. For example, joining the puppet army must also be viewed in light of the specific circumstances and generally should not be considered a crime. Didn't we also stipulate that Kuomintang soldiers should be given a share of land and property? As for the explanation of local bullies, most of them have no exact definition, and it is wrong to call people who are stingy, like to glare when speaking, have had fights with people, or have done some minor bad things as local bullies. The so-called local bullies should refer to those who have seized people's wives and daughters, property, or killed people, acted recklessly in the neighborhoods, and dominated one side, and are hated by the majority of the masses. The rest should not be called local bullies. As for the term secret agent, it should not be abused. It has long become a tool for some village cadres to attack opposition factions and rule the masses (the border government has issued a clear order that all secret agent hats given to the people by districts and villages without court trials and government approval should be removed). The vast majority of so-called secret agents have no evidence and should be immediately revoked. All middle peasants who have been wrongly struggled against for the above and other reasons should be corrected and apologized to, and their land and property should be compensated immediately and unconditionally. During winter production last year, bank loans were not given to middle peasants, and past loans to middle peasants were transferred to the poor and landless (the head office should be mainly responsible for this error), which was absolutely wrong and should be returned immediately, and it should be guaranteed that middle peasants and poor peasants have the same right to enjoy loans in the future. Landlords and rich peasants who have been converted into workers and peasants, industrialists and merchants also have the right to enjoy loans. Other things such as forcibly occupying middle peasants' cooperative shares, forcibly borrowing middle peasants' livestock for the poor and landless to transport and cultivate are absolutely wrong and should be immediately returned to the original owners or given sufficient compensation. As for this spring, in the name of "destroying the land law," such as cutting down a tree, killing a sheep, or saying a few words of dissatisfaction with "land reform," some middle peasants' property was also sealed off (such as in Lincheng), which is even more wrong and should be opened immediately and unconditionally. In many places, because they are afraid of encouraging the arrogance of middle peasants, afraid of not being able to compensate land and property, afraid of losing the face of cadres, and afraid of venting the anger of the poor peasant leagues, they are unwilling to correct the wrongly classified middle peasant components according to the Central Committee's class division documents, which is an even more wrong idea, because wrongly classifying the components is a mistake, and not correcting it is another mistake, which is called adhering to left-leaning adventurism. Some believe that middle peasants are unreliable and interpret uniting with middle peasants as neutralizing middle peasants and using middle peasants. Blindly approving the demands of the poor and landless, without criticizing or educating their shortcomings and mistakes, is a distortion of the party's correct line of relying on the poor and landless, consolidating the unity of middle peasants and all anti-feudal elements. This is an anarchistic thought that abandons the leadership of the party. The result of this execution has aroused suspicion and fear among many middle peasants, which is very dangerous. Some places insist on the principle of disrupting and dividing equally, dividing the total land of the village by the total population of the village to obtain the average number that each person should get, and blindly doing so regardless of whether the middle peasants agree or not, which will of course infringe on the middle peasants. In order to overcome left-leaning adventurism towards middle peasants, more specific regulations must be made on the policy of uniting with middle peasants, for example, (1) regardless of what reason (such as the various excuses mentioned above) to struggle against middle peasants, they must be immediately and unconditionally compensated. (2) Wrongly classified middle peasant components, raising middle peasants to rich peasants, should be corrected immediately. (3) Regardless of what reason, the property of middle peasants has been sealed, it should be opened immediately and returned in full. (4) Unconditionally implement the border government's order to remove the hat of secret agent. (5) Guarantee that the interests of middle peasants will never be infringed upon in the future. When extra land of middle peasants is to be taken, the real consent of the person concerned must be obtained. If they do not agree, the poor peasants should be persuaded to make concessions. (6) Middle peasants not only have the right to participate in cooperatives and mutual aid groups, but also can participate in leadership with democratic consent. (7) New-turnover middle peasants still have the right to participate in the leadership of the peasant association and the poor peasant league. (8) Tax policies and all levies must be fair and reasonable and must not deliberately increase the burden on middle peasants. Those who increase production due to hard work and good management, the part that exceeds a certain output may not be taxed for a certain period of time to encourage increased production. (9) Middle peasants must be absorbed to participate in the leadership of village political power, especially in old liberated areas and semi-old liberated areas that have completed land reform. New middle peasants should still occupy a leading position. Only by stipulating specific methods and resolutely implementing them can the mistakes of infringing on middle peasants be corrected and prevented.

(C) On the issue of class division, some places in your district still adhere to the previous erroneous standards and methods and are unwilling to fully divide according to the Central Committee's class division documents. (1) Instead of taking the relationship between people's possession of the means of production and people's relations of production as the only standard for class division, they still mix in comparing life, comparing history, comparing personality, and pursuing politics, which will definitely not be divided correctly. Obviously, the lives of industrialists, merchants, and hard-working, well-managed people are often better, but this should not only not be struggled against but should also be promoted and protected. History cannot be used as a standard for class division, but only according to the provisions of the class division documents. As for how the personality is and whether the ideology and politics are progressive, it cannot be used as a standard for class division. If divided according to these conditions, it will definitely struggle against industrialists, merchants, middle peasants, and even poor and landless peasants, which will disrupt our own camp. It is also wrong to take only the amount of land as the standard for class division, because some middle peasants often have more land and better quality. If it is divided according to the amount of land alone, it will inevitably infringe on the interests of this part of the middle peasants. For example, in Nanlixin Village, Xiangyuan, out of 254 households in the entire village, 56 households were classified as landlords and rich peasants, accounting for more than 22% of the total number of households in the village. In Chichi Village, Yuanshi, out of 400 households, more than 40 households were classified as landlords and rich peasants, accounting for more than 10% of the total number of households in the village. Obviously, this is putting some middle peasants into the landlord and rich peasant class, which is a serious left-leaning error. (2) Unwilling to correct and compensate the wrongly struggled households in the past according to the standards stipulated in the Central Committee's class division documents. (3) Instead of adopting the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three-list finalization to pass the class, they use the old method of raising hands to vote, forcing and threatening. For example, Lucunying Village, Cixian, is raising hands to vote for class division. In a certain village in Changzhi, an old man disagreed with being classified as a rich peasant and stood up to defend himself. The masses questioned him. Instead of guiding the masses to consider the opinions of others, the work team threatened, "If you don't tell the truth, we will send you to the People's Court." The next day, the old man jumped into the water and died. (4) In order to extract more land, they deliberately raise the middle peasant components. Originally, a prosperous middle peasant had to be divided among the middle peasants (whose exploitation income does not exceed 25%), the purpose of which is to protect, not to infringe. Now, your district is the opposite, dividing out prosperous middle peasants and raising them to rich peasants, in order to find targets for struggle and distribute more fruits, which is a great loss of the original meaning. (5) In many places, middle peasants are divided into upper-middle, middle-middle, and lower-middle three grades, and poor peasants are divided into red-poor and poor peasants, dividing the class randomly, setting the treatment randomly, resulting in the dispersion of internal unity of peasants and isolating the poor and landless. (6) The term "transformed landlords and rich peasants" has been decided by the Central Bureau several times to be canceled and not allowed to be used again, because since we want to keep the lives of landlords and rich peasants (this is certain), we should ask them to transform, or transform into workers and peasants, or transform into industrialists and merchants, or transform into freelancers, etc. Anyone who has been transformed should be welcomed, but some people in your district still advocate struggling against transformed landlords and rich peasants, that is, they do not recognize that the components of landlords and rich peasants can be transformed, that is, they do not give landlords and rich peasants a way out of life. This is also wrong.

Class division is a major event. If the class is divided wrongly, various policies will inevitably be wrong, so it must be cautious and immediately correct the error.

(D) Impatience is common in your district, and you always want to complete the task quickly. For example, in @ Guocun Village, Changzhi First District, the poor and landless groups were organized in three days, the poor peasant league was established in four days, and the party was rectified in five days. As a result, factional struggles between streets broke out on the sixth day. The Zuoquan Suicheng work team wanted to establish a poor peasant league, and the branch put forward a list of poor and landless people, and then the poor peasant league was established, and the committee members were elected. The masses opposed, and they simply conducted a review, replacing five of the seven committee members. These are all manifestations of impatience. From your guiding ideology, you have the attempt to universally complete the task of democratic party rectification and consolidation before the summer harvest. Therefore, you have arranged too many bases and your forces are too dispersed, which will definitely not be meticulous. The Party Central Committee instructed us that party rectification and land reform are both extremely complex and meticulous work. It takes two to three years to fully complete the consolidation and democratic party rectification, which is not to allow us to be impatient. Your attempt to universally complete it before the summer harvest is of course too fast.

The above is a preliminary study of the problems found in the materials sent by various counties and local party committees in your district. As far as we know, there are also many errors in other aspects, such as the closed-doorism of the poor peasant league, the struggle against landlords, rich peasants, industrialists and merchants, the failure to settle the landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of their homes, and urban policies. The district party committee should immediately organize forces to personally inspect the work of various counties, specifically criticize left-leaning adventurism and impatience, and use its greatest efforts to implement the party's policies among all party members and the broad masses. It must be done completely in accordance with the provisions of the Central Committee's class division documents. The class division documents should be widely printed and distributed, and each cadre should carefully study a copy. In case of principled issues, it must be requested beforehand and checked and reported afterward so that deviations can be corrected in time.

　　中央局指示太行区党委
  　检查纠正左倾冒险主义
    【本报消息】中共晋冀鲁豫中央局在研究了太行各地民主整党填补工作的材料后，认为太行区党委在纠正左倾错误上是有决心的，现在对各种政策认识一般也是端正的，但由于检查督促不够，各地委、县委在整党、团结中农、划阶级等问题上，仍存在着左倾冒险主义，为此特于四月二十七日发出如下指示：
    看了你区各县各地委最近材料以后，我们认为，两三个月以来，你们在执行中央路线、纠正左倾冒险主义上是有决心的，对各种政策认识，一般也是端正的。但由于你区历来存有（其他区同样有）上面作出决议指示、作过报告后，长期的不检查不督促（通常习惯是半年到一年才总结一次），下面接受指示任务后，又长期的不报告、不请示的恶劣作风，事前不请示，事后不报告（如你们四地委，在豫北杀人就是这样）的恶劣作风，以致你们对左倾冒险主义仍不能彻底肃清。中央局曾指示各区党委“要采取一切办法与下面保持密切联系，对本区内所发生的偏向，要能在一礼拜之内完全了解，并在一礼拜之内能加以纠正”，你们对此注意是不够的。我们研究你区在以下几个问题上，左倾冒险主义还表现的很严重。
    （甲）在整党问题上，你们有些党委的基本错误，在于对太行党的基本情况了解错误，根据我们研究，太行党的基本情况是：（一）组织成份不纯的问题一般不存在，比如武安九区十五个村支部及涉县南关、台华等六个村支部均未发现一个地主富农党员，主要是作风和思想不纯的问题。（二）党员一般有政治经验和工作能力。（三）不少干部党员确有很多很严重的毛病，如作风不民主、侵占果实、贪污腐化、甚至奸占女人、挟嫌诬害、给人戴特务帽子、结成“一窝蜂”，欺压群众，很象新贵新恶霸。（四）但也要区别犯错误的原因，有些错误，如强迫命令，打骂群众，往往是由于分配任务过重，规定时间太急所致，领导上应负一定责任。但有些错误如多占果实，假公济私，贪污腐化等则完全是由于党员思想蜕化，不听党的招呼，违背着党的决定去做的，则应由干部、党员自己负责，必须坚决纠正。因此整党的基本方针，应该是治病救人，教育批评斗争，分清是非轻重，分别对待。你区不少地方是采取了这一方针，并收到很好效果。但也有不少地方是采取了简单的厌恶、仇视、与一律排斥的方针，对支部党员一律否定，一脚踢开，认贫农团和农会比支部好，不是请求群众对党提出意见，帮助整党，而是放弃了党的领导权，把党看成是贫农团和农会的附属物，一任贫雇农处理。在整党方法上，也不是如同中央局所规定的党内斗争与群众批评、支部党员大会与群众代表大会相结合，严格纠正错误与热情指示出路相结合，达到教育改造之目的；而是一律斗争，一律交群众处理，而且是交给散漫的最低级的群众组织形式，即，群众大会去处理，这是十足的尾巴主义。在这种错误方针下，便发生了下列严重现象：（一）不少村干、党员与民兵逃跑自杀（如沙河、平顺、壶关、和顺、太谷等县均有此现象），或悲观失望躺倒不起，或集体抵抗领导，加深了对党的离心倾向。（二）助长了部分群众盲目反党反干部情绪，甚至说：“好人不在党、在党没好人”，加深了党与群众的对立，造成一时的无政府状态。（三）坏分子趁机捣乱，制造宗派。
    在整顿党的队伍上，各地已经创造了很多好经验，而以支部大会与群众代表大会相结合的整党方法最为健全。其步骤大致如下：工作团到村后，将干部分成两部分，同时进行下列两事，以一部分人向群众广泛宣传整党方针与公开党的意义，着重访问贫雇、也访问中农，说明与去年“洗脸擦黑”不同，打破顾虑，使群众敢于提出意见。以另一部分人，去召开支部会议，讲清民主整党与填补运动的必要，指出支部脱离群众的危险性，说明造成此种现象，有些是应该由上级负责，有些应该由村干、党员自己负责，为了人民利益，这个问题必须解决。要求党员发表意见，经过一定时期的酝酿，党员与群众均有了思想准备后，即可召开村民大会，宣布党员名单，说明做一个共产党员的条件，号召党员要接受群众批评审查，不许消极怠工，号召群众积极参加整党，但不许动手打人。再进行酝酿，群众自己开会，村干党员回避，准备提出对干部、党员和工作的意见。一切准备成熟后，即请群众选出代表，参加支部大会，帮助整党。以工作团支部为主体，结合群众代表，组成主席团，领导整党会议。群众代表向干部、党员提意见时，干部、党员可暂不申辩（以后有权申辩），领导上必须放手让群众充分揭发一切错误，在群众批评与党内斗争相结合的压力下，促进党员深入反省，这时党员内心斗争最为紧张，领导上应聚精会神提倡正气，树立骨干。待贫农团成立时，可征求一部分党员去参加（通常敢去的也是较好的党员，约占支部人数三分之一），一般均可被通过参加贫农团，并认可作党员，他们回到支部就会积极反对坏党员，支部开始分化。农会成立时，再征求一部分党员去参加（约占支部三分之一），一般又均可被通过参加农会，并认可作党员，他们回到支部，结合第一批通过的党员，也积极反对坏党员，支部再分化一批。领导上就是依靠这些已被通过的党员进一步开展党内批评与自我批评，分清好坏党员界限，分化“一窝蜂”，这一着很重要。到此支部问题已大半解决。剩下一部分党员（通常约占支部的三分之一，多是当权干部），很难通过，感到压力很大，没有出路，这时领导上须给他们以热情和安慰，说明只要彻底反省，认真改错，就有出路，至此仍不提处分，要稍微冷一下，使未通过的党员，得在填补中继续反省改正自己错误。武安九区经验，那些犯错误最大的党员，在工作团正确领导下，到了这时，大多亦能自觉自愿退出多占果实，改善作风，积极工作，他们“宁愿退出土地房屋，不愿丢掉党籍”，这时群众对他们的气已经小下来了，再召开支部与群众代表大会，让党员自由申辩，群众代表再作鉴定，最后一批党员也被认可通过。然后，分清是非轻重，分别处理。这样问题解决的很彻底，处分开除的很少。整党宣告结束。武安九区就是这样做的，其经验一般合乎我区老区情况，应为各地所取法。
    （乙）团结中农问题，你区过去用各种理由，斗争了不少中农，这是带有原则性的错误，必须坚决纠正。区党委现在的方针是正确的，但下面仍有抵抗，不愿改正。他们说：过去我们并不是斗中农，而是斗伪组织伪军分子、恶霸分子、特务分子等，问题提的这样尖锐，区党委、地委应给下面作解释。比如说参加过伪组织吧，现在的半老区曾经是敌人长期统治下的敌占区，他们为了应付敌人，参加伪组织，有时是不得已的，不能过分责备。比如说参加过伪军，这也要看具体情况，一般不能认为犯罪，我们不是还规定要给国民党士兵分一份土地财产么？再如对恶霸解释大多没有确切界说，把为人吝啬、说话好瞪眼、和人打过架，或者做过些小坏事，都一概称之为恶霸，是错误的。所谓恶霸，应该是指霸占过人们的妻女、产业，或杀害过人，横行闾里，称霸一方，为大多数群众所痛恨的分子，其余一概不能称为恶霸。至于特务一词，更不应该滥用，它早已成为某些村干打击反对派，统治群众的工具了（边府已有明令公布，凡未经法庭审讯政府认可者，所有区村加给人民的特务帽子一律摘掉），绝大多数所谓特务分子均无任何证据，应立即宣布取消。凡用上述及其他理由错斗了的中农，应一律改正道歉，其土地财产应立即无条件的补偿。去年冬季生产中，银行贷款不贷给中农，且把过去中农贷款，用转贷方法交给贫雇（此错误总行应负主要责任），这是绝对错误的，应立即退还，并保证以后中农与贫农有享受贷款的同等权利。地主富农转为工农、工商业者，亦有享用贷款权利。其他如强占中农合作社股金，强借中农牲口给贫雇运输耕种等，都是绝对错误的，均应立即退还原主，或给以足够的补偿。至于今春以“破坏土地法”名义，如砍了一棵树、杀了一只羊、说了几句不满“土改”的话等，也封闭了一些中农的财产（如临城），这更是错误的，应无条件的立即启封。不少地方，因为怕助长了中农焰气，怕补不起土地财产，怕丢了干部面子，怕泄了贫农团的气，因而对错划中农成份不愿根据中央划阶级文件加以订正，这更是错误的想法，因为错定了成份是一个错误，不订正又是一个错误，叫作坚持左倾冒险主义。有的认为中农不可靠，把团结中农，解释为中立中农、利用中农。对贫雇要求只盲目批准，其缺点与错误不加批评与教育，这是曲解党依靠贫雇、巩固地团结中农及一切反封建分子的正确路线，这就是放弃党的领导的无政府主义思想。这样执行的结果，已引起不少中农怀疑恐惧，这是十分危险的。有些地方，坚持打乱平分的原则，用全村人口除全村土地，得出每人应得的平均数，不管中农同意与否，盲目去干，这样当然要侵犯中农，不侵犯则无法达到绝对平均。为了克服对中农的左倾冒险主义，对团结中农的政策，必须作更具体的规定，比如，（一）不管用什么理由（如上述各种借口）斗了中农，均必须立即无条件的加以补偿。（二）错定中农成份，把中农提高为富农，应立即改正。（三）不管用什么理由，查封了中农财产，均应立即启封，全部退还。（四）无条件的执行边府去掉特务帽子的命令。（五）保证今后绝不侵犯中农利益，要抽中农多余土地时，必须取得本人真正同意，如不同意，即应说服贫农让步。（六）中农不仅有参加合作社、互助组之权，并在民主同意下，可以参加领导。（七）吸收中农参加农会领导，新翻身的中农仍有参加贫农团之权。（八）税收政策及一切摊派，必须公平合理，不得故意加重中农负担。由于勤劳及善于经营而提高产量者，其超过一定产量的部分，在一定时间内，可不征税，以鼓励增产。（九）必须吸收中农参加村政权领导，特别在老解放区，及已经完成土改的半老解放区，新中农还应占领导地位。只有规定具体的办法并坚决执行，才能纠正与防止侵犯中农的错误。
    （丙）在划阶级问题上，你区有些地方，还坚持过去错误的标准与方法，而不愿完全按照中央划阶级文件去划分。（一）不是以人们对于生产资料的占有关系、以人们的生产关系，为划阶级的唯一标准，而仍然是夹杂着比生活、比历史、比人格、追政治，这就一定划不正确，显然，工商业者和勤劳耕作善于经营的人，其生活往往比较好些，但这不但不应斗争，而且应提倡保护。历史更不能作为划阶级标准，只能依据划阶级文件所规定去划。至于人格如何，思想政治进步与否，均不能作为划阶级标准。如果按这些条件划起来，一定会斗了工商业者，和中农甚至贫雇，这就会斗乱自己的阵营。还有单以土地多少作为划阶级的标准，也是错误的，因为有些中农往往土地较多，质量较好，如单以土地多少为标准去划，势必侵犯这部分中农利益。如襄垣南里信，全村二五四户，共划地富五十六户，占全村户数百分之二十二强。元氏赤村共四百户，划出地富四十余户，占全村户数百分之十强，显然这是把一部分中农划到地富阶层里面去了，这是犯了严重的左倾错误。（二）对过去错斗户不愿依照中央划阶级文件规定的标准加以改正与补偿。（三）不是采取自报公议三榜定案通过阶级，而是举手表决，强迫威胁的老办法。如磁县路村营，就是举手表决划阶级的，长治某村一老汉不同意把他划为富农，起来申辩，群众追问，工作组不是诱导群众考虑人家意见，反威胁说：“你不说实话，即送你人民法庭”，第二天该老汉即跳水而死。（四）为了多抽土地，故意提高中农成份，原来在中农中还要划出个富裕中农来（其剥削收入不超过百分之二十五者），其目的是为了保护、而不是为了侵犯。现在你区却相反，划出富裕中农并提高为富农，是为了找斗争对象和多分果实，殊失原意。（五）不少地方，把中农分成上中、中中、下中三等，把贫农分成赤贫与贫农，乱分阶层，乱定待遇，结果分散了农民内部团结，孤立了贫雇。（六）化形地富这一名词，中央局几次决定取消，不准再用，因为我们既要保留地富性命（这是肯定的），就应该要求他化形，或化为工人农民，或化为工商业者，或化为自由职业者等，凡已化了的就应当欢迎，但你区现仍有人主张斗化形地富，就是不承认地富成份可以转化，就是不给地主富农以生活出路。这也是错误的。
    划阶级是一件大事，如果把阶级划错了，则各种政策必然随之而错，故必须慎重并立即纠正错误。
    （丁）急性病在你区是带普遍性的，总想迅速完成任务。如长治一区＠埚村，三天组织贫雇小组，四天建立贫农团，五天整党，结果，到第六天即爆发了街与街的宗派斗争。左权粟城工作组，要成立贫农团，由支部提出贫雇名单，跟着即成立了贫农团，选出委员，群众反对，又很简单地进行审查，七个委员换了五个，这都是急性病的表现。从你们指导思想上看，有在夏收前普遍完成民主整党填补任务的企图，因此你们布置基点太多，力量太分散，这就绝对不能搞细致。党中央指示我们，整党与土改同是一件极其复杂细致的工作，要把抽补民主整党完全搞好，需要两年到三年，这就是不让我们犯急性病，你们企图在夏收前普遍完成那当然太快了。
    以上系就你区各县、各地委送来材料初步发现的问题加以研究，其它如贫农团的关门主义，斗争地主富农工商业，不安置扫地出门的地主富农，城市政策等，据我们所知，其错误也很多，亦请注意。区党委应即组织力量，亲自检查各县工作，具体地批判左倾冒险主义和急性病，用最大力量把党的政策贯彻到全体党员和广大群众中去。必须完全按照中央划阶级文件所规定的去作，应将划阶级文件广为印发，每个干部人手一册仔细研究，遇有原则问题，必须事先请示，事后检查报告，以便能及时纠正偏向。
