　　【Taihang News】Organs directly under the Taihang District Party Committee have universally launched a campaign to practice economy for disaster relief. The organs of the District Party Committee canceled lunch for a week, with each person saving two liang of millet per day. In addition to suspending lunch for a week, the Political Department of the Military Region also had many comrades donating their personal savings for disaster relief. More than 500 jin of surplus grain and over 380,000 yuan in donations have now been handed over to the Administrative Office for distribution to disaster victims. Organs such as the Administrative Office, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Postal Administration, and the Public Security Bureau have saved and donated more than 4,000 jin of millet and over 54,000 yuan. Furthermore, Changzhi Normal School, Taihang Second Joint Middle School, and Pingshun Simplified Normal School, after hearing the Administrative Office's call for economy for disaster relief, have been actively preparing to respond. The three schools have saved a total of more than 600 jin of millet and will soon hand it over to the Administrative Office. Also, the Military Region's Liberation Theater Troupe, which had just returned from a performance in Changzhi, upon hearing the call for disaster relief, in addition to handing over 540,000 yuan of disaster relief performance funds from Changzhi to the Administrative Office for transfer to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, also voluntarily donated 300,000 yuan in makeup fees given by various organs during the performances to support disaster relief in the district. The Administrative Office and the Taihang Federation of Literary and Art Circles also donated 1,600 jin of millet and 30,000 yuan.
