[Taiyue News] Duanshi Town in the Fifth District of Qinshui County, after initially correcting the "Leftist" errors in dealing with industry and commerce, all the town's merchants began to shed their burdens of "fearing getting rich" and "fearing struggle," and prepared to develop boldly. The industry and commerce of Duanshi Town flourished with the help of our democratic government. Before the War of Resistance, there were 97 industrial and commercial businesses, which developed to 133 by 1944, and to 217 by last autumn. Last winter, during the winter production campaign, the one-sided view favoring the poor and hired peasants seriously infringed upon and struck blows against industry and commerce, resulting in the reduction of 59 industrial and commercial businesses in the town. The remaining industrial and commercial enterprises were merely keeping up appearances, afraid to develop boldly. After investigation and research, the work team, on the one hand, publicized the Party's industrial and commercial policies to merchants, small handicraftsmen, and farmers, and on the other hand, studied the ideological roots of the policies infringing upon industry and commerce, which was the treatment of urban industry and commerce from a rural perspective, in fact, a kind of idea of negating industry and commerce. For example, during the "land to the tiller" movement, every business was allocated land, and refusing it was not an option. Merchant Shen Taisheng was allocated four mu of good dry land and five fen of paddy field. If he farmed it, he would not have time to do business; if he did not farm it, he would be accused of not laboring. The village cadres believed that farming was the only form of labor, and those who did not farm were feudal exploiters. In this way, merchants were regarded as landlords and placed under control, resulting in the gradual decline of industry and commerce. The work team used practical examples of how infringing upon industry and commerce was detrimental to the peasants to educate the cadres and farmers, eliminating the idea of negating industry and commerce. Some people whose thinking was not clear also gained a clear understanding. Guo Bingli, the manager of the Lianhe Oil Mill, heard that the "Fushengchang" Oil Mill was to be returned, so he quickly sold five shi of sesame seeds; after being educated and gaining a clear understanding, he quickly bought four or five shi of sesame seeds again, so that he could start pressing oil immediately after the mill was returned. Finally, several specific measures were formulated to correct the errors: (1) The "struggle target" hats that were wrongly put on in the past should be removed. (2) The factories, workshops, shops, houses, shares, furniture, etc., that were wrongly controlled and confiscated should be returned unconditionally; for the factories, workshops, and small vendors who were bankrupted by business taxes, the government should provide low-interest loans to help them resume business. (3) In the future, business tax will only be levied on 15% of the net profit, and over-collection is not allowed. (4) The shops that were forced into joint stock by merchants and workers and merged for fear of struggle should be freely withdrawn by merchants and freely operated, and dividends should be distributed according to the shares. After these measures were announced, the cooperatives were all calculating accounts and clearing goods, preparing to return them to their original owners. Everyone was happily discussing the policies of the Communist Party. Merchant Yan Jinshui said: "Last winter, Duanshi Street was in chaos, but this year it has turned into a bright and clear sky, thanks to the policies of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." The Qinshui County Bank has allocated another six million yuan in commercial loans, which were fully loaned out on the 25th to help small businesses operate. Now every store has subscribed to a copy of the Xinhua Daily, and as soon as the newspaper arrives every day, the shopkeeper reads it aloud. Guo Baoxiang, the shopkeeper of Futaihe, said: "Reading the newspaper tells us about Chairman Mao's policies."

　　五区端氏镇
  　订出改错具体办法
    【太岳消息】沁水五区端氏镇，初步纠正对工商业上的左倾错误后，全镇商人都开始放下“怕发财”、“怕斗争”的包袱，准备大胆发展。端氏镇的工商业，是在我民主政府帮助下繁荣起来的，抗战前有九十七家工商业，到一九四四年就发展到一百三十三家，到去年秋天就发展到二百一十七家。去年冬天搞冬季生产时，片面贫雇观点，严重的侵犯和打击了工商业，全镇商业与手工业作坊减少了五十九家。其余工商业也都是支应门面，不敢大胆发展。工作组经过调查研究后，一面向商人、小手工业者、农民宣传党的工商业政策，一面研究侵犯工商业政策的思想根子，是拿农村的观点对待城镇工商业，事实上是一种取消工商业的思想。如闹“耕者有其田”时，每家生意都分给土地，不要不行。商人申泰生分得四亩好旱地、五分水地，种吧，做生意没时间；不种怕说不劳动。村干部认为种地才算劳动，不种地的都是封建剥削。这样就将商人看成地主，列入管制之列，结果闹得工商业一天一天减少。工作组拿侵犯工商业对农民不利的实际例子，向干部农民进行教育，消除了取消工商业的思想。有些思想不通的人，也认识清楚了。联合油坊经理郭炳礼，听说要退还“复盛昌”油坊，就赶快把五石芝麻卖了；经过教育认识清楚后，他又赶快买四五石芝麻，以便退还后马上就能榨油。最后订出几项具体办法改正错误：（一）过去错戴的“斗争对象”帽子要摘掉。（二）被错管制没收的工厂、作坊、店铺、房屋、股金、家具等，一律无条件的退还；被营业税征垮的工厂作坊小商贩，政府要发放低利贷款以便恢复营业。（三）今后营业税只征收纯利的百分之十五，不准多收。（四）强迫商人工人集股和怕斗争才合并的店铺，一律由商人自由抽入自由经营，并按股批红利。这些办法宣布后，各合作社都在算帐清理货物，准备退还原主。大家都喜眉笑眼的谈论着共产党的政策。商人阎金水说：“年时冬天端氏街上是混天混地，今年变成了光明青天，是毛主席共产党的政策来到了。”沁水县银行又拨来六百万元商业贷款，二十五号完全贷出，帮助小商经营。现在每家商店都订了一份新华日报，每天报纸一到，掌柜就大声念开了，复泰和掌柜郭保祥说：“看报就知道毛主席的政策”。
