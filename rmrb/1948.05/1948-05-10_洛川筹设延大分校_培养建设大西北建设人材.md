Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th: Yan'an University is preparing to establish a branch school in Luochuan, giving the vast number of young students in the newly liberated areas between the Jing, Wei, and Luo rivers the opportunity to attend school. Li Furen, the president of Yan'an University, will depart for Luochuan in the coming days to make preparations. The school aims to cultivate revolutionary intellectuals who will serve the new democratic society and the construction of the Great Northwest. Currently, it will temporarily establish departments of education, journalism, law and political science, and economics. In the future, it will add departments of agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and literature and art. The initial enrollment quota for the school is tentatively set at 500 students, with qualifications being high school graduation or equivalent academic ability. The duration of study is tentatively set at two years, and the school will provide all student food, lodging, textbooks, and stationery.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 7th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has launched a campaign to save food and aid disaster relief in the flooded areas of Huaiyang, Xiangcheng, Shangshui, and Xihua. They are reducing food and firewood consumption, saving on office expenses, and using all savings for disaster relief. Some companies eat only six liang of sorghum flour and two liang of sweet potatoes per meal. Local disaster victims who have been bankrupted by Chiang Kai-shek's breach of the dikes are deeply moved by the People's Liberation Army's actions of sharing weal and woe with the people.

　　洛川筹设延大分校
  　培养建设大西北建设人材
    【新华社西北六日电】延安大学顷在洛川设立分校，使泾渭洛川间新解放区广大青年学生得到就学机会，延大校长李敷仁日内即启程赴洛筹备。该校以培养为新民主主义社会及建设大西北服务的革命知识分子为宗旨。现暂设教育、新闻、法政、财经等系，今后将增设农、牧、工业、文艺等系。该校第一期招生名额暂定为五百名，资格为中学毕业及其有同等学力者，修学期间暂定二年，学生食宿课本文具由学校全部供给。
    【新华社中原前线七日电】解放军某部在淮阳、项城、商水、西华一带黄泛区发起节约救灾运动，减低食粮烧柴，节约办公用费，把所有节余救灾。有些连队每餐只吃六两高粱面和二两红薯。因蒋匪决堤放水而致倾家荡产的当地灾民，对解放军这种与民同甘苦共患难的行动，深为感动。
