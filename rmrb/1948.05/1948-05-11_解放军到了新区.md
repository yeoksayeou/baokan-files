    The People's Liberation Army Arrives in the New District
  "So, they are here to protect us!"
    One day in October of last year, we (a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army) launched an offensive into the KMT-controlled area and liberated Baishui City. After the comrades in the propaganda team explained the policy of the People's Liberation Army to protect cultural and educational institutions to the faculty and students of Baishui County Complete Primary School, they were moved by the actual actions of the People's Liberation Army. A certain grade teacher told me "a small thing."
    "At dawn, the artillery fire stopped. Looking out through the crack in the door, I saw a soldier with a gun standing at the school gate. 'He's watching us!' I thought to myself. But after opening the door, we were free to enter and exit, and he didn't interfere, which puzzled me. I asked the worker to bring a pot of fire and a pair of shoes for him (referring to the PLA soldier) to change into and warm up. But he declined and said, 'Sorry to trouble you.'"
    "After a while, a soldier came and asked the sentry: 'Did ×× come here?' He replied, 'No, this is a school.' Then that soldier left. Now, after listening to your words, I am completely clear. It turns out that the sentry was protecting us. Look! Your troops are so disciplined, truly unprecedented."
  "The People's Liberation Army is all so amiable!"
    After a rapid march of one hundred and thirty li, we arrived at Mailing Village in the middle of the night. It is said that so-called "river defense troops" have been stationed in this area for more than ten years. According to the experience of the local people here, passing troops at night often meant more misfortune than good fortune, so the doors of every house were tightly closed.
    "Folks!" the comrades knocked gently on a door a few times and shouted: "Open the door!" After waiting for a while, no one inside answered. They knocked again for a while, but still no one answered. The comrades went to the second house, and similarly, knocked gently on the door a few times and shouted: "Folks! Open the door!" They went to several houses in a row, but no one came to open the door.
    "Strange! Is there no one here?" the comrades became a little impatient. When they got to the sixth house, the door opened, and an old man in his fifties came out.
    "G... General," the old man trembled like a sieve, "This small village is inconvenient. Ten li to the north is a large town, where people can take care of you. I'll lead you there."
    "Old man!" the comrades saw his expression and said kindly: "Don't be afraid, we are the People's Liberation Army, the Red Army of the past."
    "Red Army," the old man was stunned for a moment, then laughed dryly and said, "Ha! Ha! I... I'm not afraid," but his voice was still trembling.
    In this situation, the comrades did not continue knocking on doors, and the troops rested in the threshing ground outside the village.
    After a while, the sound of artillery attacking Hancheng rang out, and the comrades were all excited and unable to sleep.
    The villagers also didn't sleep. The sound of the artillery shook the window paper with a "whoosh," reminding them of painful past events. In the autumn of thirty years ago, there was the same loud booming of cannons. Those "generals" "defending the river" smashed open the doors of the eastern houses to demand grain, crossed the walls of the western houses to seize laborers. Ma Fuzhen from the east of the village was taken away that night and hasn't been heard from for years. His old mother cried until she went blind, and his wife remarried. Ma Lao San from Dingzi Street didn't hand over enough five thousand jin of flour that night, and the "generals" scolded him for not assisting the "river defense" effectively, beating him half to death. Widow Bai was violated and threw herself into the river; ... one piece of bloody and tearful event after another pressed heavily on their hearts.
    The sun was high in the sky, and the villagers cautiously opened their doors. It was as if they were dreaming. The streets were swept clean. The "soldiers" (PLA) on the street were not like the "soldiers" (Chiang bandits) of the past, who would hit at the slightest provocation and curse at every turn. They were all amiable, smiling and chatting with everyone they met.
    "Ah! So this is what the Red Army is like!"
    The villagers' eyes shone with surprise, especially the children and young men, who surrounded the PLA soldiers. Laughter filled the air everywhere.
  "Eating a date is also considered a violation of discipline"
    We were stationed in × Village, Hancheng. We rarely saw young people, let alone young women.
    But the villagers paid special attention to every word and deed of the PLA soldiers. One day, the Seventh Platoon held a platoon meeting, and the landlord listened very carefully for a long time.
    The platoon leader said: "Wei Qingyu ate the villagers' dates, violating discipline. We will bring it up for criticism today."
    "Eating a date, it's nothing!" Comrade Bai Zhihai, who had just been liberated from Baishui, offered a conciliatory opinion: "Besides, he only ate one, a small thing..."
    "A small thing? Small things are the root of big things." Jiang Fugui interrupted him, raising his voice and saying: "It's not about the amount of things, every needle and thread, every seedling and grain is a matter of discipline."
    "I say, the other side's (referring to the Chiang bandits) army eats basket after basket! He only ate one, right?"
    "How can we compare with them? We are the people's army, what are they?" Everyone disagreed with Bai Zhihai's views, and the argument began. In the end, Jiang Fugui won.
    The landlord heard everything clearly. He told everyone he met: "Eating a date is also a violation of discipline, the discipline is really strict."
    Three days later, the story spread throughout the village, and young men and women all came out. The men helped transport the spoils from the city, and the women insisted on helping us cook.

    解放军到了新区
  “原来是保护我们的！”
    去年十月间的某一天，我们（西北解放军的一部）向蒋区出击，解放了白水城。宣传组的同志，把解放军保护文化教育机关的政策，向白水县立完小的教职学员讲解后，他们被解放军的实际行动感动了。某级任教员告诉了我“一件小事”。
    “天亮时，炮火停了，从门缝向外一望，校门口站着一个荷枪的战士，‘是监视我们的吧！’心里这样想，可是开了门后，我们自由的出入，他却不干涉，使我纳闷了。我叫工友端来一盆火，拿了一双鞋，让他（指解放军战士）换上烘一烘。但他谢绝了，并说：‘麻烦你了。’”
    “一会来了个战士问站岗的：‘××到这儿来了吗？’他答：‘没有，这儿是学校。’那个战士就走了。现在听了你的话后，我完全清醒了，原来那个站岗的战士是保护我们的。看！你们的队伍多有纪律，真是古来未有。”
  “解放军都是和和气气的！”
    经过一百三十里的急行军，到马陵庄已经半夜了。据说这一带十多年来常驻着所谓“河防部队”，这里老百姓的经验，黑夜过兵，往往是凶多吉少，所以各家的门都闭的紧紧的。
    “老乡！”同志们轻轻的敲了几下门喊道：“开门来！”等了一会，里边没人答应。再敲一阵，还是没人答应。同志们到第二家门口，同样轻轻的敲了几下门喊道：“老乡！开门来！”这样连走了几家都没人来开门。
    “奇怪！难道没有人吗？”同志们有些不耐烦了。到第六家的时候，门开了，出来一个五十多岁的老汉。
    “老……老总，”老汉象筛糠一样，浑身乱抖，“这小庄子不方便，北面十里是大镇子，那里有人招呼，我领你们去。”
    “老人家！”同志们看到他那种神气，便和颜悦色的说：“你不要怕，我们是解放军，是过去的红军。”
    “红军，”老汉惊讶的一怔，干笑一阵说：“哈！哈！我不……怕”但声音仍是颤抖的。
    在这种情形下，同志们再没继续敲门了，部队就在村外麦场里休息。
    一会，攻打韩城的炮声响了，同志们都兴奋的睡不着。
    老乡们也没有睡，炮声震的窗纸呼沙沙的响，他们记起了惨痛的往事。三十年的秋天，同样是大炮轰隆隆的响，那些“守河防”的“老总”们，砸破东家的门要粮，越过西家的墙抓差，村东马福桢就是那夜被抓走的，几年没音信，老娘哭瞎了眼，妻子改了嫁。丁字街马老三当晚交不够五千斤面，“老总”们骂他协助“河防”不力，打的半死。白寡妇被遭踏投了河；……一件一件的血泪事，紧压着他们的心。
    太阳老高了，老乡们战战兢兢的打开了门，象做梦似的，街上打扫的干干净净的。街上的“兵”（解放军）也不象过去的“兵”（蒋匪）那样，伸手便打，张口便骂。都是和和气气的见人就笑就拉话。
    “啊！原来红军是这个样子！”
    老乡们的眼中放着惊喜的光，特别是小孩子和年青小伙子们，把解放军的战士们团团围着，到处都洋溢着欢笑。
  “吃个枣也算犯纪律”
    我们驻在韩城×村，很少见到年青人，更见不到年轻妇女。
    可是解放军战士们的一言一行，老乡们都特别注意。一天，七班开班务会，房东十分留心的听了很久。
    班长说：“魏清玉搞老乡的枣吃，违犯了纪律，今天提出来批评。”
    “吃个枣，算不了什么！”刚从白水解放过来的白志海同志，提出调和的意见：“再说只吃了一颗，小事情，……”
    “小事情？小事情是大事情的根子。”姜福贵打断了他的话，提高嗓子说：“东西不在多少，一针一线，一苗一禾都是纪律。”
    “我说人家（指蒋匪）的军队，一篓子一篓子的吃嘛！他那才一颗吗？”
    “怎能和他们比？我们是人民的军队，他们是甚？”大家都不同意白志海的见解，争论开了，结果是姜福贵胜利了。
    房东听的清清楚楚。逢人便说：“吃个枣也犯纪律，纪律真严。”
    三天以后，这个故事传遍了全村，年轻的男女都出来了，男人们帮着从城里运战利品，女人们一定要帮我们作饭。
