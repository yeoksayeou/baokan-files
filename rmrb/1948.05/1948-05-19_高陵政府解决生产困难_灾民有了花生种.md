[Ji Lu Yu News] To meet the needs of the masses, the government allocated funds to solve the peanut seed difficulties of disaster victims in Gaoling. There are more than 270 villages in Gaoling County, most of which are sandy land. Other crops do not grow well, but peanuts grow well. Generally, peanuts can yield 150 jin, and good yields can reach 200 jin. Grain crops can only yield 3 dou per mu, and each dou is 20 jin, which is equivalent to 50 or 60 jin of grain. One mu of peanuts is equivalent to the grain yield of three mu of land, and peanut seedlings can also be used to feed livestock. Therefore, 80% of the land here is planted with peanuts every year, and peanuts have become one of the main sources of income for the masses. Due to the enemy's looting and destruction, a serious famine has been caused this year, and the masses have nothing to eat, let alone buy peanut seeds. The masses in Dongpanwu said, "If we don't borrow peanut seeds this year, we won't be able to plant even one mu out of ten mu." Based on this urgent demand of the masses, the Special Commissioner's Office allocated another 20 million yuan; and allocated 15 million yuan from the county's loans, totaling 35 million yuan, to buy peanut seeds to lend to the masses. Now, each district in Gaoling has sent people to Kunwu and other places to buy peanut seeds. The planned loan method is: first lend to all sandy villages and half-sandy villages, and lend to poor and middle peasants who cannot afford to buy peanut seeds, adopting a self-reporting and public discussion approach. Calculating that one mu of peanuts requires 10 jin of peanut seeds, each jin costs 500 yuan, and planting one mu requires 5,000 yuan, then 36 million yuan can plant 7,000 mu of peanuts. After hearing the news about the peanut seed loan, the masses in the sandy areas are actively turning the soil in preparation for planting.

　　高陵政府解决生产困难
  　灾民有了花生种
    【冀鲁豫消息】适应群众要求，政府拨款解决高陵灾民花生种困难。高陵全县共有二百七十余村，大部是沙地，种别的庄稼不长，就是种花生长的好，一般花生能收一百五十斤，好的能收二百斤。种庄稼一亩才能收三斗，每斗廿斤，合五、六十斤粮食，一亩花生顶三亩地收粮食，花生秧还可喂牲口。所以这里每年要有百分之八十的土地种花生，花生成为群众主要收入之一。因遭敌人的抢掠破坏，造成今年的严重灾荒，群众都没有吃的，更买不其花生种。东潘五的群众说：“今年不贷花生种，十亩也不准能种一亩。”根据群众这一迫切要求，专署又拨款二千万元；并在本县贷款中提出一千五百万元，共三千五百万元，买花生种来贷给群众。现高陵各区已分别派人去昆吾一带买花生种。预定贷的办法是：先贷全沙村及半沙村，贷给自己买不起花生种的贫农中农，采取自报公议。一亩花生需花生种十斤计算，每斤五百元，种一亩需要五千元，那末三千六百万元可种花生七千亩。沙区群众听到贷花生种的消息后，正积极倒地准备下种。
