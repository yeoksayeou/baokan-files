Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 21st—Miners in Jinzhong, whose coal mine is located less than ten li from a Yan Xishan bandit stronghold, are engaging in armed struggle to protect their coal mine due to the Yan bandits’ incessant harassment. In the past, Yan Xishan's troops frequently came to the mine to loot coal, resulting in a loss of 3.45 million jin in the year before last. The workers' livelihoods were jeopardized, and the factory suffered a serious blow. The trade union persuaded the factory to sever its "maintenance" relationship with Yan Xishan's bandits and resolutely implement armed resistance. The workers also organized a militia to take turns on patrol and used landmines to block the village entrances. From last year to the present, they have killed and wounded a total of 23 Yan Xishan bandits, enabling the mine to produce safely, leaving the bandits in their strongholds only able to sigh with envy. The miners' armed forces have also cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in penetrating the plains to fight, once capturing a stronghold, capturing two enemies, seizing two guns, and winning over more than ten enemy soldiers to surrender.

　　晋中矿工武装护矿
    【新华社晋绥二十一日电】晋中距阎匪某据点不足十里的煤矿工人，不堪阎匪骚扰，进行武装斗争保护煤矿。过去阎匪军经常至该矿掠取煤炭，前年即损失三百四十五万斤，工人生活无着，厂方亦遭严重打击，工会乃说服厂方断绝对阎匪“维持”关系，坚决实行武装抵抗。工人并组织民兵，轮班放哨，以地雷封锁村庄入口，去年迄今共炸死炸伤阎匪二十三人，使矿厂安然生产，据点阎匪只好望矿兴叹。矿工武装并配合解放军深入平川作战，曾攻占据点一处，俘敌二人，缴枪二支，并争取敌十余人投诚。
