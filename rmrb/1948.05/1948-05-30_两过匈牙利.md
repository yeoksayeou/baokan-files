　　Two Visits to Hungary

　　Far to the west of China, on the European continent, lies a country of yellow people – Hungary. This time, on my way from Czechoslovakia to Yugoslavia, I had to pass through this land.

　　At a little after eight in the morning on the 23rd, we arrived at the Czechoslovak-Hungarian border. The Czech customs officials, seeing that we were wearing badges from the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, completed a simple registration procedure, and the train immediately headed towards the Hungarian border.

　　Unexpectedly, a short, stocky middle-aged man jumped onto the train and called our names, wearing the same badge as us. He turned out to be sent by the Hungarian trade union to meet us. We immediately got off the train and went to a café, had some beer and soda. We didn't even have to pay. We then jumped back on the train and headed straight for Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The weather was clear that day, and a gentle breeze blew on our faces, which was quite pleasant. The train kept racing alongside the Danube River. Herds of cattle and sheep were under the shade of willow trees. Shepherds were holding small shovels, waving at passers-by. People's eyes and the eyes of the cows were smiling at us. Pigeons soared in the fields, flying over the Danube towards the quiet villages. On both sides of the Danube, the wheat was over a meter tall, rising and falling with the wind, thanking the river for its nourishment. This lovely Danube, for so many years, was a river of trouble, a river of noise, a river of war, a river of blood. Today, she has found peace. She irrigates the fertile wheat fields, flower gardens, and vegetable gardens for these peace-loving people of the new democracy. It reminded me of how many years ago, the Mongols from the far east, carrying tents, driving cattle and sheep, carrying cheese, occupied the vast Danube grasslands and how they engaged in bloody battles with the local people. History has passed. Who is right and who is wrong? The people here are now studying this question.

　　"We are descendants of the Mongolian people. Now the bloodlines are a bit mixed. The language here has Mongolian and Volga River roots. Many villages in the Danube River basin are inhabited by people who look exactly like Chinese." Indeed, many people have high noses and blonde hair, but some people's eyes and hair are completely Chinese. The people here are very hardworking and not very particular about their clothes. In the past, they suffered all kinds of oppression. After liberation, they have obtained a new democratic life. While casually chatting, it was already past twelve o'clock, and the train had entered Budapest station.

　　Budapest is made up of Buda on the left bank of the river and Pest on the right bank. People have built many beautiful and magnificent bridges over the Danube, connecting the two. This city has a population of 700,000, which is considered a very beautiful and famous city in Europe. The people in charge of the trade union had already arrived at the station. We shook hands with them one by one and began the tour during the four hours the train stayed there. First, we went to a restaurant for a meal. Then, Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Comrade Gaosa accompanied us to the Parliament. We then crossed the river from Buda to Pest and went to a high mountain on the riverbank. There was a huge monument to the Red Army martyrs. Overlooking the entire city, the river flowed past the foot of the mountain, through the heart of the city, and southward. The streets in the city are clean, but 70% of the houses have been destroyed. However, the appearance of the city is still magnificent and beautiful. The Hungarian people already have a three-year plan to engage in reconstruction. This country has 700,000 Communist Party members, one million trade union members, and 80% of the population are farmers. The land of the reactionary landlords has been confiscated and distributed to the farmers. The liberation of this country was achieved by the Communist Party and the people of the whole country with the help of the Red Army. In the Parliament, the Communist Party is the leading party. The Social Democratic Party is second, but there are divisions within the party, with half being progressive and half flirting with the right-wing. In addition, there are the Small Landowner's Party, the Peasant Party, and non-party members. In short, the progressive forces are in an absolute advantage. The United States constantly tries to secretly support the extreme right-wing pro-German elements and pull in the right-leaning elements of the Small Landowner's Party. When we were in Yugoslavia, this conspiracy had already been discovered domestically. When we were in Budapest, the Hungarian Communist Party members emphasized vigilantly: "There are still a few 'Chiang Kai-shek elements' in our country. We must eliminate them!"

　　They were very concerned about the development of democratic forces in China and constantly asked about the situation in China. When I talked about "China has 140 million people in the liberated areas fighting alongside democratic people throughout the country against Chiang and the United States. The armed forces of the liberated areas have 1.5 million regular troops and 4 million militia, annihilating 100 brigades of Chiang Kai-shek (now of course more), seizing American-equipped weapons and equipping themselves. The Chinese people know that Chiang and the United States want to destroy China. For the independence, peace, and democracy of China, we must finally eliminate the reactionaries. Only in this way can we guarantee peace in the Far East." They were extremely excited when they heard this. One comrade emphasized:

　　"The Mongolian people are determined to fight alongside the CCP. The Mongolian People's Republic, Inner Mongolia, and our Hungary, all Mongolian races, have been liberated, all under the leadership of the Communist Party."

　　At four o'clock in the afternoon, we returned to the station. The General Labor Union sent us many fruits and cigarettes. At the border, the train guard said to the customs inspector: "International Trade Union." That official stamped our passports and gave a military salute, and we passed through Hungary.

　　On July 21st, returning from Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, because my pre-booked round-trip plane ticket had expired, I had to rush to Czechoslovakia earlier, passing through Hungary for the second time. Comrade Gaosa was presiding over a meeting in the Parliament, so we went directly to the Parliament. The meeting happened to be on a half-hour break, and he received us in the deputies' lounge of various parties. He said:

　　"Your visit to our Parliament this time is of great significance. The issue we are discussing today is the issue of eliminating the reactionaries, to pass the issue of depriving reactionaries of the right to vote and be elected in Hungary today."

　　Indeed, I saw in the newspapers shortly after returning to Paris that this motion had been passed. The conspiracy of the United States was broken once again. It overestimated itself too much. To try to stir up trouble in a country where the people have already stood up is only asking for trouble. The soul of the reactionaries still wants to be resurrected, how can it be done in broad daylight? In the Hungarian Parliament, we were in contact with members of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and newspaper reporters from various newspapers, all crowding around asking questions. Newspaper reporters were busy taking pictures, and the hosts and guests were busy raising their glasses. I proposed according to the principles said by Comrade Dimitrov:

　　"New democratic people's organizations already have legitimate and normal contact in the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Youth Federation, and the Women's Federation, and we must strengthen it in the future. Our trip only serves as exploration and paving the way. Now I have proved that this is a broad road, and our two countries must regularly exchange experiences and lessons of this new democracy to consolidate this anti-fascist world peace united front." Everyone shook hands excitedly. Newspaper reporters insisted that I express my impression of Hungary. How could I draw a conclusion on the way through by train? But there is one thing I can say.

　　"Besides seeing you and the people of South, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia as excited and happy as you, I also know that South has a five-year plan, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia have a two-year plan, and you have a three-year plan. New democratic countries are all working day and night to build peace for mankind. Looking back at American imperialism, it has a plan to build atomic bombs to destroy peace that dares not see the light of day. Now the strength of socialism, new democracy, and the people of all countries is unprecedentedly strong. The conspiracies and tricks of the reactionaries will sooner or later be illuminated by the strong sunlight and turned into ashes and pus."

　　"Goodbye! Dear brothers and sisters!"

### 两过匈牙利

　　两过匈牙利
    在中国遥远的西方，欧洲大陆上，还有一个黄种人的国家——匈牙利。这次我从捷克到南斯拉夫去，要路过这个国土。
    二十三日上午八点多钟，到了捷匈交界处，捷克海关看到我们佩着世界工联大会的徽章，简单的作了一个登记手续就完了，火车一下子就驶向匈牙利边境。
    没有料到一个短粗个子的中年汉子跳上车来喊我们的名字，胸前佩带着和我们同样的徽章，他原来是匈牙利工会派来接我们的。当即下车到了咖啡馆里，吃过了一些啤酒、汽水，连钱也用不到我们付，又跳上车去，一直驶向匈牙利的京城布达佩斯。这天天气清朗，和风迎面吹来，倒觉十分有趣。火车一直伴着这多瑙河赛跑，牛羊群在柳树荫里，牧童拿着小铲，向行人招手，人的眼睛和牛的眼睛齐望着我们微笑。田里的鸽子翱翔着，掠过多瑙河飞向那静静的村落，多瑙河的两岸，麦子有一人多高，随风起伏，感谢着河水对它的滋泽。这可爱的多瑙河，多少年来，是多恼之河、多闹之河、干戈之河、流血之河。今天哪，她获得了平静，她为这爱好和平的新民主主义的人们灌溉着肥美的麦田、花圃和菜园。使我回忆到多少年前自东方远来的蒙古人，带着帐篷，赶着牛羊，背着乳酪，横据了广阔的多瑙草原，和这里的人民又是如何的展开血战。历史过去了，谁是谁非，这里的人们今天已研究这问题了。
    “我们是蒙古利亚人的后裔，现在人的血统已有点乱了，这里的语言，有蒙古语和伏尔加河的语根，现在多瑙河流域很多村子住着的人们，完全是中国人的样子。”的确，很多人是高鼻黄发，也有些人的眼睛头发，完全是中国人。这里的人们很能吃苦耐劳，穿衣服也不大讲究。过去他们受着种种压迫，解放之后，已经获得了新民主主义的生活。顺便漫谈着已是十二点多了，火车已进了布达佩斯车站。
    布达佩斯，是布达城在河之左，佩斯城在河之右，人们在多瑙河上架起了很多美丽壮观的桥梁，把它俩连起来了。这座城有七十万人口，在欧洲说是座十分美丽的名城。工会的负责人们已经到了车站，我们一一握过手，就在这火车停留的四个钟头中开始游览。首先到了餐馆吃了一次饭，回头匈牙利副总理高萨同志陪我们到了国会。又从布达过河到了佩斯城，到了河岸一座高山上，那里有一个巨大的红军烈士纪念塔，了望全城，河水流过山下，穿过街心，一直荡向南方。城里的街道整洁，但是房子已有百分之七十炸毁了，可是城市的外表，依然是壮观美丽。匈牙利的人民已经有个三年计划，从事复兴建设。这个国家有七十万共产党员，一百万工会会员，人口百分之八十是农民，反动的大地主土地已经没收分配给农民了。这个国家的解放，是共产党和全国人民在红军帮助之下解放的，在国会中，共产党是起着主要作用的党；社会民主党次之，该党内部分歧，一半进步，一半和右派吊膀子。此外还有小地主党、农民党及无党无派，总之进步力量是占绝对优势。美国不时想暗中支持极右派亲德分子，拉小地主党中的右倾分子。当我们到南斯拉夫时，国内已经发现了这个阴谋案。我们在布达佩斯时，匈共党员十分警惕的强调着：“我们国家里还有少数‘蒋介石分子’，我们一定将他们清除出去！”
    他们对中国民主力量的发展十分关切，不断的问起中国的情形。当我讲到“中国已有一万万四千万解放区人民协同全国民主人士和蒋美斗争，解放区人民的武装，已有一百五十万正规军，四百万民兵，消灭了蒋介石一百个旅（现在当然更多了），将美械化武器夺取过来装备了自己。中国人民知道蒋美要灭亡中国，我们为了中国的独立和平与民主，一定要最后消灭反动派，只有这样，才能保障远东的和平。”他们听了兴奋异常，一个同志强调的说：
    “蒙古人坚决与中共共同奋斗。外蒙古共和国，内蒙和我们匈牙利，所有的蒙古种族，都获得了解放，都是在共产党领导之下解放了。”
    下午四点我们又回到车站，总工会送了我们许多水果和香烟。到了国界，守车人对海关检查员说：“国际工会”，那官员代表在我们护照上盖了一个图章，行了一个军礼，就过了匈牙利。
    七月二十一日，从南斯拉夫、保加利亚归来，因为我预定的飞机来回票已经到期了，要早点赶到捷克，二次经过匈牙利。高萨同志正在国会主持会议，我们就一直到了国会。会议正好休息半小时，他就在各党的议员休息室招待我们，他说：
    “你们这次来到我们的国会，意义非常重大，我们今天讨论的问题是清除反动派的问题，要在今天通过反动派在匈牙利被褫夺选举权与被选举权的问题。”
    不错，这个议案我回到巴黎不久就看到报纸上说通过了。美国的阴谋再一次被打破，它太不自量了，要想到人民已经站立起来的国家去捣鬼只是自讨苦吃。反动派的灵魂还想借尸还魂，如何能够在光天化日之下办的到呢？在匈牙利国会，和我们接触的有共产党、社会党的议员、各报的新闻记者，一齐拥挤着问长问短，新闻记者忙着照像，宾主忙着举杯。我根据季米特洛夫同志说的原则提议道：
    “新民主主义的人民组织，已在世界工联、青联、妇联有了合法的正常的联络，今后要更加紧起来。我们这一行只作为探索探路。现在我已经证明，这是一条康庄大道，我们今后两国人民要经常来往，交换这新民主主义的经验教训，巩固这反法西斯的世界和平统一阵线。”大家兴奋的握手。新闻记者硬要我发表一点对匈牙利的印象，这怎样能在火车过路中下结论呢？但是有一件事可以说一下。
    “我除了见到你们和南、保、捷的人民一样的兴奋慰快之外，更知道了南国有个五年计划，保国和捷克有个两年计划，你们有个三年计划，新民主主义国家，都是为了人类的和平建设，日夜加倍努力。回头看看美帝国主义，却有个不敢见天日的造原子弹破坏和平的计划。现在社会主义、新民主主义和各国人民的力量空前的强大，反动派那种阴谋诡计，迟早会被强烈的阳光照得化为灰烬与脓血。”
    “再见吧！亲爱的兄弟姐妹们！”
