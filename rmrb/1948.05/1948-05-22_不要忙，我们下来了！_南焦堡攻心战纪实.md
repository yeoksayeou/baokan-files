　　"Don't rush, we're coming down!"
    ——A True Record of the Psychological Warfare at Nan Jiao Fort
    Lu Yan
    On the morning of March 7th, the 8th Company of a certain unit of the "65th Detachment" of our Jin-Nan Front Field Army launched an attack on the Nan Jiao Fort stronghold and the bridgehead to its east, located on the outskirts of Linfen. The enemy defending the area was the 1st Company of the puppet Security 15th Regiment. After a day of confrontational fighting, the enemy continued to resist, relying on their core pillbox. They even bluffed, saying, "Come on, we have grenades for you to eat." At dusk, after our intense firepower shot at the enemy, we immediately started shouting, "You're finished, quickly find a way out! We are here to liberate you!" The enemy remained silent and continued shooting. I then concentrated fire to bombard the enemy, and one shot collapsed a corner of the enemy's pillbox. The enemy's arrogance diminished, and they began to waver. I immediately stopped the fire, seized the opportunity, and launched psychological warfare. For a time, shouts rang out everywhere: "Lay down your weapons, laying down your weapons is a way to live!" "Laying down your weapons makes you a friend, not laying down your weapons makes you a deadly enemy!" "If you don't lay down your weapons, we'll flatten the pillbox." The enemy panicked and said, "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!" The pillbox door opened a crack, but nothing happened for a long time. Our army issued a warning: "If you don't lay down your weapons, we will open fire again." At the same time, the troops surrounded the enemy from both sides. The enemy hurriedly shouted, "Coming, coming! Don't shoot!" Then one person came out. After our army comforted and advised him with a lenient policy, the soldiers followed him into the pillbox. At this time, the enemy had already tied up their guns, and all thirty-six men laid down their weapons. From the prisoners, we learned that the enemy in the bridgehead to the east was from the same company as them.
    Our army immediately took advantage of the victory and attacked the bridgehead. The brave and resourceful people's fighters, drawing on the experience of the previous encounter, first concentrated fire to fiercely attack the enemy, and then shouted, "Don't fight anymore, the people over there have already surrendered!" The enemy immediately replied, "How many people surrendered over there? Who are they? Call one of them over to talk." Yuan Guoying, who had just been liberated, expressed his willingness to go and answer, so we asked him to go forward and answer: "Squad Leader Bai, lay down your weapons. We have agreed with the Liberation Army battalion commander that your safety will be guaranteed if you lay down your weapons. Otherwise, you see, the artillery is already set up here." The enemy didn't reply for a long time. When we ordered to open fire again, the enemy shouted loudly, "Don't rush, we're coming down." Twelve enemies tied up their guns neatly, carried their backpacks, and walked down the pillbox in an orderly manner, laying down their weapons.

　　“不要忙，我们下来了！”
    ——南焦堡攻心战纪实
    芦焰
    三月七日早晨，我晋南前线野战军“六五部队”某部八连向临汾外围之南焦堡据点及其东侧之桥头堡垒进攻。该处守敌为伪保安十五团第一连。经过一天的对峙战斗，敌人还凭恃他核心的碉堡继续抵抗。并且虚张声势地说：“你们来吧，有手榴弹给你们吃。”黄昏时，我以密集火力向敌射击后，随即进行喊话：“你们不行了，赶快找活路吧！我们是来解放你们的！”敌人一声不吭，仍在打枪。我又集中火力向敌轰击，一炮就打塌敌人碉堡一个角落。敌人气焰下降，开始动摇了。我即停止火力，抓紧火候，展开攻心战。一时喊声四起：“缴枪吧，缴枪是活路！”“缴枪是朋友，不缴枪是死对头！”“不缴枪把碉堡打平。”敌人着慌的说：“不要打！不要打！”碉堡门闪开了，但好久不见动静。我军发出警告：“不缴枪，又要开火了。”同时部队由两面向敌人包围。敌人慌忙喊叫：“来了来了！不要打！”接着走出一个人来。我军以宽大政策安慰劝告他后，战士们就随他走进了碉堡。这时，敌人已经把枪捆好，三十六人全部放下了武器。从俘虏口中，知道东侧桥头堡垒的敌人与他们是一个连。
    我军紧接着就乘胜向桥头堡垒攻击了。英勇机智的人民战士接受了刚才的经验，首先集中火力向敌猛击，然后喊话：“不要打了，你们那边的人已经投降了！”敌人马上答话：“那边投降了几个人？都是啥人？叫一个过来拉拉话。”刚解放过来的袁国英表示愿意前往答话，我们就叫他向前答话了：“白班长，缴枪吧。我们和解放军营长说好了，缴了枪保证生命安全。要不，你看这里炮已架好了。”敌人好久没有答话。等我们又命令开炮时，敌人大叫起来：“不要忙，我们下来了。”十二个敌人把枪捆得好好的，背着背包，整整齐齐的走下碉堡，放下了武器。
