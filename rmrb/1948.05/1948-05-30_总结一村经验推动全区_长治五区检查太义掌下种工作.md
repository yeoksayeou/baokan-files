Summarize the experience of one village to promote the entire district
　　Changzhi Fifth District inspects Ta Yizhang's work of planting seeds
　　The experience of Ta Yizhang in planting seeds is: 1. Cadres lead deeply and solve problems in a timely manner. 2. Middle and poor peasants unite and resettle landlords. 3. 90% of women were mobilized to work in the fields. 4. Fair distribution is determined.
　　[Changzhi News] Ta Yizhang Village, Changzhi Fifth District, held a meeting of village cadres and team leaders on May 2 to inspect spring plowing. The village has a total of 1,628 mu of land, of which 1,400 mu have been planted, leaving only 200 mu unplowed and unplanted. In order to promote the rush planting in the entire district, the district leadership studied why it could be done so quickly. After discussion, the following four points of experience were identified:
　　(1) Cadres actively lead and deal with problems in a timely manner. For example, Song Qifa, the spring plowing committee member, said: "The cadres have reformed their old work style and are always in the mutual aid teams, solving problems before they occur." (2) Middle and poor peasants unite to engage in production and resettle landlords. For example, poor peasant Fan Tailai said: "This year, we often talk with middle peasants in the mutual aid team in the fields and at meals. The middle and poor peasants are like brothers, and only by getting along well can we do a good job in production." The village cooperative helped the landlord borrow farm tools, and now most of the landlord's land has also been planted. (3) Mobilizing women can顶汉 [this is a term, meaning "be as good as men"], and can do more than half of the work in life. For example, Chen Zhongze (female), the head of the mutual aid team, said: "The women in our village have done eight things in the fields this year: pulling seed drills, pulling harrows, leveling the ground, spreading fertilizer, hoeing the edges of the fields, breaking clods, pulling stone rollers, and a few carrying manure." Everyone calculated that there are 207 women in the village. Apart from those who are tired of raising children, more than 160 are often working in the fields, accounting for 90% of the total. The reason is that they share profits with their families at a 3:7 ratio. For example, the chairman of the Women's Federation said: "Last autumn, the women of Sanjie shared profits from collective textile production. This year, they are all wearing new clothes. My group's little daughter, Song Gaiying, gets work points every day." (4) Fair distribution, not cheating on a single bit of labor. The mutual aid team implements work points, flexibly assigning and fixing points, with each point worth four liang of rice (old scale), with a difference of five to ten points. Work points are recorded on the spot and at mealtimes every day, without cheating on a single bit of labor. The living arrangements are also good. Special people are in charge of plowing and seeding, which is fast and good, and can make the best use of everyone's talents. In addition, all cadres above the team leader level conduct a small self-criticism every five days and a major self-criticism every ten days. Cadres and the masses all talk about democracy. After such inspection and summarization, the whole village continues to seize the time to rush plant.

　　总结一村经验推动全区
  　长治五区检查太义掌下种工作
    太义掌下种的经验是：一、干部深入领导，及时解决问题。二、中贫农团结，又安置地主。三、发动了百分之九十妇女下地。四、订分公道。
    【长治消息】长治五区太义掌村，在五月二号召开全村干部组长会议检查春耕。全村共种地一千六百二十八亩，现已有一千四百亩完成下种，只剩二百多亩没犁没下种。区领导上为了推动全区突击下种，研究为什么能干的这样快，经讨论有以下四点经验：
    （一）干部积极领导，发现问题及时处理。如春耕委员宋启发说：“干部改造了旧作风，时刻在互助组里钻，不等发生问题就解决啦。”（二）中贫农团结闹生产，安置地主，如贫雇范太来说：“咱们今年在互助组里时常和中农在地里、饭市上谈话，中贫农好比弟兄俩，非和好才能闹好生产”。地主缺农具，村联社帮他借，现在地主的地也大部种完。（三）发动妇女能顶汉，生活能干一多半，如互助组长陈忠则（妇女）说：“咱村妇女今年在地办了八件事：拉耧、拉耢、就地、盘肥、刨地边、打圪垃、拉砘子、还有少数担大粪。”大家计算，全村二百零七个妇女，除累孩媳妇外，经常上地的有一百六十多个，占总数百分之九十。原因是和家庭三七分红，如妇救会主席说：“去年秋耕，三街妇女分上红，在一块集体纺织，今年都穿的是新衣服，我组小女儿宋改英每天得工票”。（四）订分公道，不屈一分劳力，互助组实行工票，死分活订，每分四两米（老秤），订分五分至十分差别，每天有地头开工票和吃饭开工票，不屈一分劳力。生活安排也好，专人掌犁掌耧，又快又好，能做到人尽其材。另外所有组长以上干部，五天一小检讨，十天一大检讨，干部群众都讲民主，经这样检查总结后，全村继续趁垧突击下种。
