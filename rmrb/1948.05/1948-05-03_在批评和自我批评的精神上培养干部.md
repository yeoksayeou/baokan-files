This article is a "Party Life" editorial from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, published in the 23rd issue of that journal in December 1947. It elaborates in detail on the importance of criticism and self-criticism. Currently, our region's land reform movement is vigorously carrying out rectification. Every Party member and cadre should grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, resolutely correct the shortcomings and errors that exist in their work, correctly implement the Party's policies, and thoroughly complete the historical task of land reform. Therefore, we are reprinting this article for the reference of comrades in various regions. - Editor

　　The struggle being carried out nationwide to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule indicates that we have great potential to accelerate the movement forward. Many aspects of this matter depend primarily on the quality of all our work and our ability to overcome difficulties and correct shortcomings on the road ahead.

　　Naturally, criticism and self-criticism hold a special place in our struggle to accelerate our advance towards communism. The victory of the socialist system in our country has forever ended the blind and spontaneous laws of social development. The faster and more fully we expose and eliminate the obstacles and shortcomings on our road forward, and the more actively we support the budding of new things that are developing forward, the smoother the development of socialist society will be. Criticism and self-criticism under the socialist system are the real driving force of social development and the law of movement forward.

　　Our country is led by a single party, the Communist Party. Precisely for this reason, Comrade Stalin educated us: "If we want to move forward, shouldn't we expose and correct our own mistakes? Isn't it clear that no one else can expose and improve ourselves better than ourselves? Comrades, self-criticism is an important force driving us forward." Therefore, Comrade Stalin requires leading cadres to summarize their work every day, to examine the effectiveness of their activities more frequently and more seriously, not to be afraid to review themselves, to bravely criticize their own shortcomings, and to conduct self-criticism under the following conditions: first, to be good at honestly exposing shortcomings and errors in their work, to study practical experience, to scientifically generalize this experience, and to apply this experience to leadership.

　　Here, the widespread development of democracy has created great possibilities for the timely exposure and rapid correction of shortcomings and errors in our practical work: on the one hand, it is natural that only the leader discovers the shortcomings, and his observation is limited because he views the problem from above; on the other hand, when we absorb and improve the experience of the broad masses, who are closely related to the work and can enrich the experience of the leaders with their own experience, and participate in the work of discovering and correcting shortcomings. In the conditions of the Soviet Union, those who are not good at using the experience of the led, those who are not interested in platforms for criticism, self-criticism and other opinions (such platforms as our discussion meetings, conferences, enlarged meetings, temporary congresses, newspapers, etc., are precisely those that can fully mobilize us and help us eliminate shortcomings), are not worthy of being a leader.

　　The Party should insist on educating cadres to be sincerely concerned about developing criticism, to educate them on how to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and how to treat their own work critically. In this regard, the Party has made great achievements. In various departments of economic and cultural construction, there are a large number of such workers who are good at using the weapon of self-criticism, can sensitively treat suggestions from below, and actively eliminate shortcomings. Party work cadres who have a truly Bolshevik model attitude towards criticism and self-criticism should have the above characteristics.

　　But we must not forget that we are precisely educating our people with Bolshevik qualities in the struggle with the new and the old, and with the remnants of the old society that hinder the growth and perfection of the Soviet people. One of the legacies that the old bourgeoisie left us is the view of criticism as a damage to the prestige and reputation of those who are criticized. The bourgeoisie is built on deception and coercion, they are afraid of light and criticism, they painstakingly hide their shortcomings and cover them up with a facade of peace. Comrade Stalin pointed out: if the bourgeois gentlemen "allowed a certain degree of serious self-criticism and a certain degree of free criticism of all their shortcomings, then the bourgeois system would collapse and cease to exist. Capitalist society carries out a cruel law of competition that divides humanity and cultivates individualism, making people distrust each other. Socialism ends this system of dividing humanity and inciting mutual killings, and turns criticism into a great way for comrades to help each other for the purpose of improving work. Under our conditions, the purpose of criticism by any worker is to help him correct his shortcomings. Criticism is the expression of the whole society's concern for everyone, hoping that everyone's work will bring great benefits, because all our labor is no longer a private matter, it already has its direct social nature.

　　If we say that under our conditions it is unthinkable not to care about developing criticism and self-criticism, then it is unthinkable to talk about truly caring about improving work. Therefore, the attitude towards criticism can be a measure of the level of socialist consciousness of work cadres and whether they can put social interests above personal self-esteem. Of course, because criticism and self-criticism are aimed at the shortcomings and errors committed by specific workers, it cannot but cause various personal emotional distress. A person can only accept criticism without much pain if they put down the burden of feeling they have many advantages; only those who are exhausted by the burden of individualistic remnants and have not been tested by the practice of Soviet social education have resentment and morbid self-esteem; this resentment and self-esteem can often obscure their understanding of the essence of criticism that plays a positive role in correcting shortcomings; for such people, we can say that he is not yet qualified to be a true leader. Comrade Stalin said that a leader who cannot forget personal self-esteem and put his emotions above the interests of the cause is not a good leader. It is said that there are facts of pursuing journalists for criticism in newspapers. Comrade Stalin called these facts: "the remnants of bourgeois morality".

　　Unfortunately, this attitude towards criticism still exists here. This attitude is fundamentally contrary to the role of criticism under the socialist system. This attitude sometimes even exists in the life of the Party. Not long ago, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a resolution because the Party organization of Bekegersko City suppressed criticism. When the Standing Committee of the Bekegersko City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union discussed the resolution of the Stavropol Special Committee on the dismissal of the secretary of the city committee, several comrades expressed some criticisms and accusations against the Stavropol Special Committee in their speeches. Based on this, their speeches at the Standing Committee of the City Committee were regarded as the crime of organizing an anti-Party group, and they were held responsible to the Party. The staff of the City Committee demanded that the Communist Party members who criticized the Special Committee make statements in order to defend themselves in the future criticism, organized the review of the "qualities" of the Party members who spoke at the meeting, and openly gave serious Party punishments and removed them from their posts.

　　The Stavropol Special Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ignored the fact that the Bekegersko Party organization suppressed criticism, and did not correct the mistakes made by the City Committee. In addition, Comrade Bashkin, the second secretary of the Special Committee, participated in the Standing Committee of the Bekegersko City Committee. He not only failed to point out the mistakes made by the City Committee, but also spoke at the meeting of activists in the city to hold accountable the Party members who criticized the members of the Special Committee, asking them to be responsible for their speeches. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ordered the Stavropol Special Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to re-examine the erroneous materials on holding accountable the Party members who spoke at the Standing Committee of the Bekegersko City Committee, and pointed out to Comrade Bashkin, the second secretary of the Stavropol Special Committee, that his erroneous speech at the meeting of activists of the Bekegersko City Committee helped the Party organization of Bekegersko City to suppress criticism.

　　What happened in the Bekegersko City Committee proved that there are still individual Party cadres who ignore this basic common sense: that is, if criticism is met with force, there can be no active Party life and growth of cadres, and attempts to treat criticism with stupid bureaucratic management methods and punishments will quickly expose themselves as people who are not good at leadership, cannot rely on the enthusiasm of the Party's masses, and cannot answer the demands of the masses on leading cadres.

　　Of course, the same facts of obstructing criticism that existed in the Bekegersko City Party organization are not very common, and these facts are not difficult to discover. When criticism is ignored, or used as a cover for the widespread development of criticism, but in fact it is strangling any concern for truly exposing shortcomings and errors, then the problem becomes much more complicated. There are also some work cadres who are determined to do everything well, so as to make it appear that they are the most attentive to listening to opinions and criticism. Such work cadres often do not obstruct other people's opinions. Some, in order to please the public, superficially write down all the criticisms and accusations raised by others in their diaries and even express their gratitude for the criticisms, vowing to correct the shortcomings, but they do nothing to turn his reflection into practical things. This attitude of turning reflection into empty talk is the most severe attitude of strangling criticism.

　　A few months ago, the Party organizations of the central organs and various ministries of the government held meetings. At the meetings, serious criticisms were made of the shortcomings of the work of the organs and the errors of individual staff members. Many issues raised at the meetings required supplementary research, review and adoption of future measures. Many suggestions were put forward at the meetings on improving work; but in fact, no practical conclusions were made in individual government departments after the meetings. The Party committees of these agencies ignored the criticisms made by the Communist Party members. Such an attitude towards criticism gave the Party losses that were no less than the attitude of rudely suppressing criticism. The true Bolshevik attitude to criticism is not only to listen to criticism attentively, but first of all to implement the correctness of criticism with what kind of enthusiasm. Leaders who are accustomed to ignoring criticism and seeing that others have no blame for themselves paralyze their responsibility before the Party. At the same time, this disregard for criticism reduces the active role of the Party organization, reduces the responsibility for correcting shortcomings, and makes some people see that their own criticism is useless, so they either do not speak, or begin to speak carelessly, because they feel that no matter what you say, no one will pay attention.

　　This incorrect attitude towards criticism and self-criticism is nothing more than the various forms of bureaucracy lurking in our state organs, and the ills that exist in our Party organization. Comrade Stalin said: "The danger of bureaucracy is first and foremost that it restricts the enthusiasm, initiative and independence of the masses, and it prevents a large number of reserves latent in our ranks from playing their role." Self-criticism is such a driving force that can help us to inspire the initiative of the masses, help to fully utilize the possibilities of the Soviet system, and can resolutely expose the losses that various forms of neglect of self-criticism directly bring to our cause.

　　The Party must educate leading cadres in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism every day, and this education can only be achieved under the circumstances of developing democracy within the Party. Self-criticism and democracy within the Party are inseparable. The Party's practical activities have created many ways of collective work. These ways guarantee effective criticism and correction of shortcomings, and guarantee that the broad masses of the Party not only actively participate in deciding issues, but also actively participate in all aspects of leading the life of the Party: the Party committee, the Congress, the activist meeting, as the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union said in its resolution in February to March 1937, is: "one of the best stages for developing criticism of the shortcomings of our work and self-criticism by the Party's leaders." The most important task of the Party organs - is not only to ensure that various Party meetings are convened regularly, but also to gradually improve the level of discussion of issues, and resolutely eliminate the factors of extravagance, cliche and old-fashionedness in the discussion of issues. The serious shortcoming that hinders true Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism is that we often turn the debates that should be held at the meeting into the nature of the report meeting, the purpose of the speech is not to help correctly solve various practical problems and correct shortcomings, but to report on the work they have done, citing a lot of statistical materials.

　　Leaders should lead criticism and self-criticism. Whether the questions are raised sharply in the discussion, whether the self-esteem of individuals is catered to, whether the criticism is only directed at ordinary staff members, or whether the purpose is to expose the true cause of the shortcomings regardless of the position of the work, these questions are how they are raised, it all depends first and foremost on the attitude of the leader. Criticism is not simply admitting various faults and errors in the work. Criticism should be aimed at discovering the essence of the errors, exposing their roots, in order to plan methods of improving the cause. This requires the larger leading cadres to be good at deeply analyzing phenomena, good at distinguishing the main and secondary, and good at finding the essence from the phenomenon. Leaders should be able to listen to all valuable criticisms and accusations, even if these criticisms and accusations seem unimportant at first glance; at the same time, he should be good at explaining the errors in this or that criticism, and not take a hands-off attitude towards the flattering and flattering speeches of incorrect tailism. We do not need all other criticisms and self-criticisms. What we need is criticism that improves leadership, strengthens discipline, and enhances the enthusiasm and responsibility of Communist Party members. The political maturity, ideological level and principle of the Party's leading cadres can be checked on the issue of whether they are good at organizing such criticism.

　　If criticism and self-criticism become a daily working method, rather than being carried out from time to time, then the critical significance and educational role of helping to improve work will be fully reflected. Usually, criticism is only developed when there is a serious loss in the work: unfortunately, when the error is still in the embryo, when it can be ended by only exposing the bad roots, we rarely develop criticism and expose errors; due to our untimely exposure of shortcomings, we have suffered great losses, although there are some things that can be quickly corrected without great effort, we often ignore this bud and consider it unimportant, if the staff's problems develop over time, so that we have to take serious measures, even develop to dismissal and so on. Defects in various jobs do not happen suddenly at any time, they are often developing gradually; if the leader thinks that it happens suddenly, it is only because the leader himself has no critical attitude towards the work and ignores the warning signals. Facts show that sometimes it is necessary to replace cadres. For example, if a district committee secretary had been criticized and accused long ago, and had been promptly taken care of to help him, then things would not have developed to an irreparable point, so that we would not have been able to save this cadre. It often happens that criticism is only directed at staff members with a bad reputation, while those who are recognized as good are placed outside the circle of criticism, stopping pointing out shortcomings, and complimenting him without measure, which is a way to harm a promising staff member.

　　The Bolshevik Party ensures the education and training of cadres by not obliterating the shortcomings and errors of work cadres, resolutely and thoroughly exposing them, and helping them to correct them, and by educating cadres with their own mistakes; the Party only uses the interests of the cause as its guiding principle, it only cares for the interests of the cause, and it does not care for the self-esteem and emotions of the cadres. We require cadres in various economic and ideological departments to be principled and objective in their attitude towards criticism.

　　All one-sidedness will cause losses to our cause, this is a great lesson. The issue of the errors in the literary criticism of Fadeyev's famous novel "The Young Guard" is an example. Everyone focused their attention on analyzing the indelible advantages of this novel, ignoring the criticism of the serious shortcomings of this novel; for the further development of literature and the improvement of the writer himself, it should be pointed out that in this novel, the leading role of the Party was not expressed, and the image of the Bolshevik underground workers was distorted and other principled errors were committed.

　　When we have not objectively examined the various phenomena in life, and come to praise or criticize them in their entirety, it will hinder the practical correction of shortcomings and hinder the development of cadres. In addition, this attitude is most likely to make those who are politically immature and have achieved a little bit, have an attitude of looking down on the world, being self-satisfied, and everything going well. Everyone knows, for example, that the Party organization has done a lot of work in implementing the resolution of the February meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and has achieved significant results in the post-war recovery and the development of the rural economy; of course, this does not mean that all the shortcomings of the rural Party's work have been overcome. In order to truly improve the level of leading collective farms, in order to thoroughly expose all the shortcomings and loopholes in the past, based on popularizing the experience of the past year, there are still many things to continue to do; but because the Party workers have done the first time in improving their work, they put criticism behind them, and replace it with extravagant praise, which is usually followed by the concept of complacency and peace in the world.

　　It has been published in this magazine the errors of the Mordovian Party organization, who called the enlarged meeting of the provincial committee to summarize the rural economy for a year the "Meeting of Victors", so the discussion of the issue became a kind of inspection of mutual praise and flattery. Even more indecent was that the secretary of the Kabavi Kinsko Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union received a flurry of congratulatory telegrams and congratulatory messages after completing the task of grain requisition, and his own telegrams of thanks to the district committees and collective farms filled the pages of the local newspapers.

　　A true Bolshevik will never be complacent about his own achievements. They remember well what Stalin said, satisfied with their victory, "that is the end point of our movement forward; in order to prevent this from happening, we need self-criticism." The greater our success, the higher the victory premise we create, then, the higher the demands on our cadres, and victory and success should not only not ignore our shortcomings, on the contrary, they should more resolutely help to expose shortcomings; only this attitude can guarantee the continuous progress of our economic and cultural construction in all departments. The tasks facing our country require raising the level of leading cadres and strengthening criticism and self-criticism. If we do not develop criticism of those things that hinder the digging of our possibilities and preparations, we cannot accelerate economic development; if we do not develop principled and objective criticism on the ideological front, we cannot overcome the remnants of capitalism in the consciousness of the Soviet people; only courageous self-criticism can enable cadres to improve, and can victoriously solve the tasks of communist construction. The important responsibility of the Party organization is to constantly cultivate cadres in the spirit of self-criticism.

　　在批评和自我批评的精神上培养干部
    叶群译
    本文为联共“党的生活”社论，载于一九四七年十二月该刊第二十三期，对批评与自我批评之重要性阐述甚详，目前本区土地改革运动正大力进行纠偏，每个党员、干部均应掌握批评与自我批评的武器，坚决改正在工作中所存在的缺点和错误，正确的贯彻党的政策，彻底完成土地改革的历史任务。为此，特将此文转载，供各地同志参考。——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    在全国范围开展着的为提早完成五年计划而进行的斗争，指示出我们有着加速运动向前发展的极大可能。这件事情的许多方面，首先依赖于我们全部工作的质量，以及我们善于克服前进路上的困难和改正缺点。
    自然，在我们为了加速前进到共产主义的斗争里，批评和自我批评有着特殊的地位。社会主义制度的胜利，在我国范围永远地结束了社会发展的盲目和自发的规律，能越快、越充分地揭发，扫除我们前进路上的障碍和缺点，越积极地扶植向前发展着的新的事物的萌芽，那么，社会主义社会的发展，就会更加顺利。社会主义制度下的批评及自我批评，是社会发展的真正动力、是运动前进的规律。
    我们的国家是由一个党领导着的，这是共产主义者的党，正因如此，斯大林同志教育我们：“如果我们想要前进，我们应当揭发和改正自己的错误，这难道还不明白吗？任何另外的人不能比自己更能揭发和改进自己，难道还不明白吗？同志们，自我批评是推动我们向前发展的一种重要力量”。由此，斯大林同志要求领导干部每天总结自己的工作，要求他们更经常地更严肃地检查自己活动的效果，不害怕检讨自己，勇敢地批评自己的缺点，要在下列条件下进行自我批评——首先善于诚实地揭发工作中的缺点和错误，研究实际经验，科学地把这些经验普遍化，并把这些经验运用到领导上去。
    在我们这里，广泛地发扬民主，就造成了及时揭发、迅速纠正我们实际工作中的缺点与错误之极大可能：一方面，只是由领导人去发现缺点，自然，他的这种观察因从上面来看问题，是有局限性的；当着我们吸收与改进工作血肉相关的能以其本身经验来丰富领导人的经验的广大群众，参加到发现和改正缺点的工作中去的时候，又是另一方面。如果一个不善于利用被领导者经验的人，如果一个对批评、自我批评及其他发表意见的讲台不感兴趣的人（这种讲台例如我们的讨论会、大会、扩大会、临时代表大会、报纸等等正是能够使我们完全行动起来的能帮助我们扫除缺点的），在苏联的条件下，他们是不配成为一个领导者的。
    党应坚持教育干部，使他们对展开批评有真心真意的关心，教育他们怎样去开展批评及自我批评，自己应怎样以批判的精神去对待自己的工作。在这方面，党已经取得了很大的成绩，在经济、文化建设各部门中，有着很大数量的这样的工作人员，他们善于使用自我批评的武器，能敏锐地对待来自下层的建议，积极地扫除缺点；有真正布尔什维克对待批评及自我批评模范态度的党的工作干部，是应该具有上述特点的。
    可是不能忘记，我们正是在新的与旧的，与妨碍苏联人民生长和完善的旧社会残余作斗争中来用布尔什维克品质进行对我们人民的教育的。旧资产阶级留给我们的遗产之一，是对待批评的看法，认为批评对于被批评的人来说，是对他们的一种威信与名誉的破坏。资产阶级是建筑于欺骗和强迫之上的，他们骇怕光明和批评，他们处心积虑把自己的缺点隐藏起来，用天下太平的盖子来把它掩饰起来。斯大林同志指出：如果资产阶级的老爷们“对自己所有的缺点容许若干程度严肃的自我批评和若干程度的自由批评，那么，资产阶级制度就是分崩瓦解不复存在了。资本主义社会进行着残酷的分裂人类的培养个人主义的竞争规律，使人与人间互不信任，社会主义结束了这种分裂人类怂恿互相撕杀的制度，把批评变成以改善工作为目的的同志间互相帮助的伟大办法。在我们的条件下，任何一个工作者的批评，其目的都在于帮助他改正自己的缺点。批评，这是全社会对于每一个人的关心的表现，希望每一个人的工作都带来极大的益处，因为我们所有的劳动已不复是私人的事，它已有其直接的社会性质。
    如果说，在我们的条件下不去关心开展批评与自我批评，那么去谈真正关心工作的改善是不可思议的，因此对待批评的态度，可以成为标示工作干部的社会主义觉悟水准和能否把社会利益放在个人自尊心之上的尺度。当然因为批评与自我批评是针对着具体工作人员所犯的缺点和错误的，就不能不引起各种个人感情上的难过；一个人如果在接受批评时不致有很多痛苦，只有放下感到自己优点很多的包袱；只有被个人主义残余的大包袱压得疲惫不堪和没有经受过苏维埃社会教育的实际考验的人，才有着气愤和病态的自尊心；这种气愤和自尊，常常能够蒙蔽他们认识对改正缺点起积极作用的批评之本质；对于这样的人，我们可以说，他还不够做一个真正的领导者。斯大林同志说过，领导者不能忘记个人的自尊心，把自己的感情置于事业的利益之上，他就不是好的领导者。据说有为了报纸上的批评而追究记者的事实，斯大林同志把这些事实称之为：“资产阶级道德的残余”。
    可惜我们这里还存在着这种对待批评的态度，这种态度，是与社会主义制度下的批评作用根本相矛盾的，这种态度有时甚至存在于党内生活里。不久以前，联共党中央因为别基格尔斯科市党的组织压迫批评而通过了决议。联共党别基格尔斯科市委常会在讨论斯大乌洛伯尔斯科特委关于市委书记撤职的决议时，有几个同志在发言中表示了对斯大乌洛伯尔斯科特委的一些批评和指责，根据这点，就把他们在市委常会的发言，作为组织反党集团的罪过，并向他们追究对党的责任。市委工作人员要求批评特委的共产党员作声明，以便将来在批评中给自己辩护，组织了对会议上发言党员“品质”的审查工作，并公然给以严重的党的处分和撤去工作职务。
    联共党斯大乌洛伯尔斯科特委忽视了别基格尔斯科党组织压迫批评的事实，并且没有改正市委所犯的错误。此外还有特委第二书记巴希金同志参加了别基格尔斯科市委常会，他不仅不能指正市委所犯的错误，并且在城市的积极分子会议上发言追究批评特委委员的党员，要他们对自己的发言负责。联共中央责成联共斯大乌洛伯尔斯科特委重新审查关于向在别基格尔斯科市委常会发言党员追究责任的错误材料，并向联共特委第二书记巴希金同志指明他在别基格尔斯科市委的积极分子会议上，自己的错误发言帮助了别基格尔斯科市党的组织对批评的压迫。
    别基格尔斯科市委所发生的事情，证明了还有个别党的干部，不理会这个起码的常识：就是如果对批评兵刃相加，就不可能有积极的党的生活和干部的生长，就要企图以愚蠢的官僚管理的办法和处罚来对待批评，那就很快的暴露了自己是不善于领导的人，不能够依靠党的群众的积极性，和不能够回答群众对领导干部的要求的人。
    当然，象别基格尔斯科市党组织存在过的对批评阻碍的同样事实不是很常有的，并且这些事实也不难于发现。当批评被忽视，或以广泛的开展批评来做掩护，而实际上却是绞杀任何关心真正揭发缺点和错误的时候，那么问题就复杂得多了。还有一些工作干部，他们决心做好一切，以便做出他们是最注意倾听意见和批评的样子，这样的工作干部，常常并不阻碍别人的意见，有的为了哗众取宠，表面上把别人所提出的批评指责，都记在日记本上甚至对批评表示万分感谢，誓言改正缺点，但是要把他的反省变为实际的事，他却一点也没有做，如此把反省变为空谈的态度，是最厉害的绞杀批评的态度。
    几个月前，中央机关和政府各部党的组织开过了会议，在会议上，对于机关工作缺点和个别工作人员的错误，进行了严重的批评，会议上提出的很多问题，要求补充研究检讨和采取今后办法，会议上提出了不少关于改良工作的意见；但是实际上，会后在个别政府部门中没有作出任何实际的结论。这些机关的党委组织，忽视共产党员所作的批评，这样的对待批评的态度，给予党的损失并不亚于粗暴的压迫批评的态度。对批评的真正的布尔什维克的态度，不仅仅在于注意倾听批评，而首先在于用怎样的积极性去实现批评的正确。领导者习惯于忽视批评，并看到别人对自己并无责备，他就麻痹了自己在党面前的责任。同时，这种忽视批评，降低了党组织的积极作用，减低了改正缺点的责任，使得有的人看见他自己的批评毫无作用，就或是不发言，或是开始不认真去发言，因为他觉得无论你怎样说，反正人家也不会注意。
    这种不正确的批评和自我批评态度，不外就是幽栖在我们国家机关中的各种形态的官僚主义，和在我们党组织中存在着的毛病。斯大林同志说：“官僚主义的危险，首先具体表现束缚群众的积极性、主动性和独立性，它使我们队伍里潜在着的大批后备力量不能发挥出来”。自我批评就是这样一种动力，它能帮助我们启发群众的主动性，帮助充分利用苏维埃制度的可能性，并能坚决揭发各种形式的忽视自我批评的现象所直接带给我们事业上的损失。
    党要使领导干部每天都在批评和自我批评的精神中受到教育，而这种教育只能在发扬党内民主的情形下才能获得成绩。自我批评与党内民主是不可分离的党的实际活动，创造了集体工作的许许多多的方式，这些方式，保证了有效的批评和改正缺点，保证了广大的党的群众不仅仅积极参加决定问题，而且积极参加了领导党的生活的各个方面：党的委员会、代表大会、积极分子会，如同联共中央在一九三七年二月到三月决议上所说的一样，是：“开展对我们工作的缺点批评，和党的领导者自我批评最好的舞台之一”。党的机关最重要的任务——不仅仅要保证经常召集党的各种会议，而且是逐渐的提高讨论问题的水平，坚决的消灭讨论问题中的铺张、八股、老一套的因素。妨碍真正布尔什维克的批评和自我批评的严重缺点，就是我们常把会议上应有的争论，变成汇报会的性质，发言的目的不是帮助正确解决各种实际问题和改正缺点，而是报告他们所做的工作，引证出很多统计材料。
    领导者应当领导批评和自我批评，在讨论中是否避免尖锐的提问题，是否将就个别人的自尊心，是把批评仅仅针对着普通的工作人员，还是不顾虑工作地位以揭发缺点的真正原因为目的，这些问题如何提法，都首先是看领导者的态度。批评不是简单承认工作中的各种过失和错误，批评应是以发现错误的本质，揭发其根源，以便策划改良事业的方法为目的，这就要求较大的领导干部，善于深刻的分析现象，善于分清主要的和次要的，善于从现象中找出本质来。领导者应当能于倾听所有的宝贵的批评和指责，即使这些批评和指责，初看起来似乎是并不重要的；他同时应当善于解释这种或那种批评中的错误性，对不正确的尾巴主义的奉承阿谀的发言，不采取袖手旁观的态度。我们需要的不是所有其他的批评和自我批评，我们所需要的是改善领导，巩固纪律，提高共产党员的积极性和责任感的批评。党的领导干部，政治上的成熟性，思想水平和原则性，就是在是否善于组织这种批评的问题上可以检查出来。
    如果批评和自我批评成为日常的工作方法，而不是一个时期一个时期来进行的，那么，帮助改善工作的批评意义以及教育作用，才会充分体现出来，通常发扬批评仅仅是在工作有了严重的损失的时候：可惜得很，当着错误还在胚胎中的时候，还在仅仅揭发坏根就可以结束它的时候，我们却很少展开批评和揭发错误；由于我们揭发缺点的不及时，我们已遭受了很大的损失，虽然有些并不需要费大的力量就可以迅速纠正的事，我们却常是忽略这个萌芽而认为它是不重要的，要是工作人员的毛病随着时间发展起来，以至于不得不采取严重的办法，甚至发展至撤职等等。各种工作的缺陷，任何时候不是突然发生的，经常都在逐渐发展着；领导者如果认为是突然发生的，那仅仅是由于领导者自己对工作没有批评的态度，忽视了预告的信号。事实说明了有时不得不撤换干部的事，譬如说如果一个区委书记要是很久以前已对他有过批评和指责，已及时注意帮助了他，那么事情就不会发展到不可收拾的地步，而使我们不能够挽救这个干部。常有这样的事，批评仅仅是针对着声名不好的工作人员，而把公认为好的置诸批评圈外，停止了指明缺点，没有分寸地恭维他，这种办法是会害了一个有出息的工作人员的办法。
    布尔什维克党是以他的不抹煞工作干部的缺点和错误，坚决彻底地揭发他们，帮助他们纠正来保证对干部的教育和培养的，是以干部自己的错误来教育干部的；党仅仅是以事业的利益来作为它行动的方针，它照顾的仅仅是事业的利益，而照顾的不是干部的自尊心和情绪，我们要求各经济、思想部门中的干部，对待批评要有原则，要客观。
    一切片面性都会给我们事业带来损失，这是个很大的教训。在评论法捷耶夫著名小说“青年近卫军”之文艺批评的错误问题上，就是一例。大家都集中自己的注意力去分析了这本小说的不可抹煞的优点，忽略了对这本小说的严重的缺点的批评；为了文学进一步的发展及作家本身的提高，应当指出在这本小说中，没有表示出党的领导作用，和把布尔什维克地下工作者的形象加以歪曲以及犯了其他带有原则性的错误。
    当着我们对生活中的各种现象还没有客观地检查时，而来全盘地吹嘘恭维，或是全盘地非议，就会妨碍实际纠正缺点和阻碍了干部的发展。此外，这种态度对那个政治上不成熟而有了一点点成就的人，最容易使他们发生昂首天外，自高自满，百事大吉的态度。大家都知道，例如党的组织在执行联共中央二月会议的决议时，做了很多工作，在战后恢复和农村经济的发展上，得到了重大的成绩；当然这决不是说所有的农村党的工作缺点已经克服了，为了真正的提高领导集体农庄的水平，为了在普及过去一年经验的基础上，彻底揭发过去所有的缺点和漏洞，还有很多的事要继续去做；可是由于党的工作者在改进自己的工作上做了第一次以后，就把批评置诸脑后，而代之以铺张赞颂，通常随之而来的是高枕无忧和天下太平的观念。
    在本杂志上已公布过莫尔多太党组织的错误，他们把总结一年农村经济的省委扩大会称之为“胜利者的大会”，因此就把问题的讨论变成某种互相发表吹嘘恭维的检阅。比这更不体面的事，是联共党喀巴维金斯科省委书记完成了征粮工作以后，所收到的雪片飞来的贺电和祝辞，以及他本人对区委和集体农庄的谢电登满了地方报纸的篇幅。
    真正的布尔什维克，任何时候也不会高枕无忧于自己既得的成绩之上，他们很好地记住斯大林所说的话，满足于自己的胜利，“就是我们运动前进的终点；为了使这种情形不致发生，我们需要自我批评”。我们的成功越是大，我们所创造的胜利前提就越是高，那么，就要更高地要求我们的干部，胜利和成功不仅不能忽视我们的缺点，相反的，应当更坚决地帮助揭发缺点；只有这种态度，能够保证我们的经济、文化建设在各部门中不断的前进。摆在我们国家面前的任务，要求提高领导干部的水准，加强批评和自我批评。如果对那些妨碍掘发我们可能性和准备力量的事情不展开批评，那么，就不能加速经济的发展；不在思想战线上开展原则的客观的批评，就不能克服在苏维埃人民意识中的资本主义残余；只有勇敢的自我批评能够使干部提高，能够胜利地解决共产主义建设的任务。党的组织的重大责任，就是不断的在自我批评精神中培养干部。
