　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 2nd: Military and civilians in a certain area of the Central Plains Front held a grand celebration rally on the 28th to celebrate the recovery of Yan'an. Commander Liu Bocheng said in his speech: "The recovery of the democratic holy land of Yan'an is a milestone in the nationwide revolutionary victory." He said: "Last March, after the bandit Chiang occupied Yan'an, he was elated, thinking that occupying Yan'an would solve all problems. At that time, Chairman Mao told us that Chiang's occupation of Yan'an marked his failure and death. Now we understand even better the brilliance of Chairman Mao's strategic guidance. Now that we have recovered Yan'an and have fought all the way to Baoji, it shows that the Northwest People's Liberation Army has grown infinitely stronger in one year and one month. On the Central Plains battlefield, we have captured Luoyang, the temporary capital of the Chiang bandits. In the future, we will capture Chongqing, the secondary capital of the Chiang bandits, Nanjing, the capital, as well as Guangdong and Guangxi and Taiwan. The realization of New Democracy throughout the country is not far away. Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor who replaced the traitor Wang Jingwei, will surely die at the hands of the people." Commander Liu finally said: "We celebrate the recovery of Yan'an and strive for nationwide victory. First, we must unite with the masses under the leadership of Chairman Mao and work diligently to achieve a complete victory in the Central Plains. We must meet the needs of the masses, correctly implement policies, do a good job in production and land reform, and unite closely with the masses. We must complete the task of consolidating the army, implement the three major democracies, and study well the strategies taught to us by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Finally, we will overthrow the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and drive American imperialism out of China!" Deputy Political Commissar Zhang Jichun called on the entire army at the meeting to do three things: First, eliminate the Chiang bandits in the Central Plains; second, do a good job in mass work; and third, complete the task of consolidating the army. The local village chief also spoke, calling on everyone to help the Liberation Army here fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. At the meeting, firecrackers were set off and flags fluttered from various units and villagers, and yangko dances were performed everywhere, creating an extremely enthusiastic atmosphere. In the evening, a local county opera troupe also performed to add to the excitement.

　　中原庆祝光复延安
  　刘伯承将军盛赞西北我军强大号召全军好好学习毛主席战略
    【新华社中原前线二日电】中原前线某地军民二十八日举行盛大的光复延安庆祝大会，会中刘伯承司令员演讲说：“民主圣地延安的光复是全国革命胜利的里程碑。”他说：“去年三月蒋贼侵占延安后兴高采烈，认为占了延安就万事大吉。当时毛主席就告诉我们说，蒋贼侵占延安就是标志着他的失败和死亡，现在我们更明白了毛主席战略指导的英明。现在我们光复了延安，一直打到了宝鸡，说明了西北人民解放军已经在一年一个月中无限的壮大了。在中原战场上我们打下了蒋贼的行都洛阳，将来我们就要打下蒋贼的陪都重庆、首都南京以及两广和台湾。全国新民主主义的实现已经不远了，代替了汉奸汪精卫的蒋贼介石一定要死在人民的手里。”刘司令员最后说：“我们庆祝光复延安，争取全国胜利，首先要在毛主席的领导下和群众团结一起，兢兢业业的取得中原的圆满胜利。要满足群众的需要，正确执行政策，作好生产土改工作，与群众紧紧团结一起，要完成整军任务，实行三大民主，好好学习毛主席、朱总司令教导我们的战略，最后打倒蒋介石统治，把美帝国主义驱逐出中国去！”副政治委员张际春同志在大会上号召全军做好三件事：第一、消灭中原蒋匪；第二、作好群众工作；第三、完成整军任务。当地村长也讲话，号召大家要好好帮助这里的解放军打到南京去，活捉蒋介石。会上各部队及驻村群众鞭炮齐鸣，旗帜招展，到处扭着秧歌，情况极为热烈，晚间某县剧团并演戏助兴。
