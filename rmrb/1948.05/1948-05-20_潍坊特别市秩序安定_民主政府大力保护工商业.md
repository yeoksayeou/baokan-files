Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th: The democratic government of Weifang Special City is vigorously carrying out restoration work and earnestly protecting industry and commerce. Six militiamen from the Sanjiawang Village of Taidi District in Weibei County (the northern part of the former Weixian County of the new county) entered the city to find Wang Ligeng, a rich peasant from their village who opened a printing house on Bayajie Street, to settle accounts. The democratic government promptly dissuaded them. Geng Lingjiu, a shareholder of the Dongguan Weaving Factory, was a rich peasant and feared that the peasants would settle accounts, so he originally planned to dismantle his shares and stop business. After witnessing the above facts, he immediately resumed work. He said: "For the past few years, I have been deceived and blinded by the Kuomintang's propaganda, and I did not understand the Communist Party's policies. Today, I have seen right and wrong from the Communist Party's actual actions." The Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Dahua Company have transported a large amount of rice, flour, oil, salt, and other items from the countryside to sell at parity prices to supply the daily needs of the citizens. The refugee reception center allocated 8,000 catties of grain on April 25th and 28th alone to relieve 526 refugee families. The Education Bureau is actively planning to restore all existing public and private primary and secondary schools, and has determined that all existing teachers and staff who are willing to serve the new democratic culture will be retained. The New Weifang Daily is very popular among the citizens, and its circulation increased from 2,000 copies to 3,500 copies in the first seven days of publication. Regarding the Kuomintang party and government personnel in the city, the Public Security Bureau has reiterated the lenient policy that the ringleaders will be punished, the coerced will not be investigated, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded, ordering them to register as soon as possible. By the 7th, more than 1,200 people had applied for registration in the four districts.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China Frontline, 15th: The People's Liberation Army found two Japanese soldiers among the captured Chiang soldiers in the Jiaoji Central Section Campaign. One is Kiyoto Yamada, alias Xu Yaoting, from Gunma Prefecture, originally belonging to the Japanese Fifth Mixed Brigade, now serving as a heavy machine gun technical instructor in the 13th Regiment of the bandit Shandong Provincial Security Sixth General Team. One is Sukesaburo Yokota, alias Shi Xiyuan, from Shimizucho, Nishi-ku, Osaka City, originally belonging to the 35th Regiment of the Japanese Ninth Division, now serving as a lieutenant platoon leader of the 3rd Company of the 9th Regiment of the bandit Provincial Security Eighth General Team.
