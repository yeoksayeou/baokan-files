Qinghe News: The Qinghe Third District convened a three-day short-term training class for 486 village cadres from April 7th to 9th, initially resolving the ideological problems of village cadres and deploying spring plowing and production work. The details are reported as follows:

At the summary work meeting of all cadres of the Third District work team on April 3rd, everyone examined that recent work was not only not improving, but was becoming more depressed. After discussion, the reasons were: 1. In-depth work mainly involved visiting poor and hired peasants, with little understanding of the situation of middle peasants. Furthermore, even when visiting poor and hired peasants, it was not to understand their demands, what difficulties they had in production, or how to distribute fruits, but rather to simply investigate the mistakes of village cadres, preparing for party rectification and land reform, investigating for the sake of investigation. Therefore, work could not be guided according to the urgent demands of the masses. 2. Kicking aside village cadres, avoiding village cadres, and searching for poor and hired peasants everywhere caused panic among village cadres, and the masses were also at a loss. For example, the masses in Baoliguzhuang said: "After the cadres return from the meeting, they are like water mosquitoes, drilling everywhere. What's going on!" The masses who were visited were even more afraid when they heard inquiries about the village cadres; they could only answer: "The village cadres are all very good." The village-level organization was not functioning, and a few district cadres were acting alone, with no achievements in the work, and the district cadres were also disappointed. One comrade said: "I used to know how to work, but now I don't know how to do it well." 3. The dismissal of two company commanders and several village cadres was not publicized, causing village cadres to feel that the days of being rectified and stepping down were coming. They did not care or ask about their work, and they would only move if pushed, and sometimes not even then.

At the beginning of this meeting, the leadership first explained that the attitude towards village cadres this time was to reform and educate. The good ones would be praised, and the bad ones would be criticized. Those with mistakes must correct them. At the same time, Bi Yunlu, the director of the D辛庄 Farmers' Association, who actively led the masses in production, was commended, and it was pointed out that actively leading the masses in production was the way out for village cadres. The village cadres were all relieved to hear this. A new cadre from Tian Village said: "If you don't have a disease in your stomach, you won't die." The company commander of Huayuan said: "This gives us a good opportunity to change."

On the morning of the 9th, when the village cadres conducted self-reflection and expressed their attitudes, the leadership adopted an informal approach, letting them talk freely. Whether it was personal mistakes or opinions on superiors, no matter how much or how little, they were to say whatever they had. As a result, the meeting place was very active. From everyone's clamoring, the following ideas could be seen: 1. Panic and unease, complaining about superiors, and not doing work. Liu Zhicheng, the representative of the Louguanzhuang neighborhood, reflected: "The district cadres only drill into the masses. Who will talk to us? It's like hoeing the ground, the superiors have to start it! We haven't been able to figure out what to do these days. We're just afraid that during party rectification, we'll be killed by landlords, lackeys, and people who have grudges against us. We're just thinking about stepping down soon. What are we going to do?" Tang Sanggui, the secretary of the Dongguan Central Branch, said: "After the district cadres returned from party rectification, they would say as soon as they met us: 'Look at the way you're dressed, neither military nor civilian.' They gave us a cold shoulder and didn't talk to us at all, just drilling into the poor and hired peasants. We thought this must be the time to rectify cadres. We were just thinking about getting through this, whether we did well in the past or not, we would be brushed down if we couldn't pass, but we were also afraid of being killed by bad people, and we were uneasy every day." 2. Taking each day as it comes. There are superiors above and subordinates below. It won't do not to manage, but if you manage, you're afraid the masses will say you're interfering. It's neither deep nor shallow, and if there's a bump, it trips you up. It's better to do less than to do more. Zhao Shanqing, the director of the Lǐgǔzhuāng Farmers' Association, said: "I'm just afraid in my heart and dare not work. They say implement democracy, and whatever the masses say is what it is. The district cadres are like weaving girls, and the village cadres are like trappers (used on weaving machines). Pull one and move one." 3. Afraid of offending people, the more work you do, the more people you offend, and sooner or later you'll end up in a mess and step down. Pan Lianshen, the accountant of Zhongding Village, said: "The more years you work, the more people you offend. We think it's wrong, but the masses say implement democracy, and we're afraid of offending the masses!" Village Chief Feng Keling said: "I just want to quit being the village chief. It would be good to be dismissed one day sooner, the sooner the better. I went to Daying to deliver leather. It was originally a one-day job, but I deliberately stayed for three or four days to avoid offending people when dividing the fruits."

Based on the village cadres' thoughts, the following issues were pointed out in the summary: (1) A few village cadres still held skeptical attitudes. For example, Han Fengde, the village chief of Machang Village, said: "The superiors are saying this, aren't they just stroking our hair and then using us all at once, waiting until party rectification to talk about it again?" The leadership reiterated its attitude and policy towards village cadres, explaining that the purpose of this meeting was to change everyone's thinking, actively work to correct mistakes, understand the opinions of the masses, and prepare for future mass review. (2) Some cadres believed in the discussion that "it doesn't count as a mistake if you're wrong for work, only if you're wrong for yourself." The summary pointed out that it was equally wrong to be wrong for work (of course, mistakes are inevitable in work, as long as they are corrected), because if mistakes are made, the masses will suffer losses. They also thought of some ways, such as: "When the village holds a meeting, it shouts with a loudspeaker for half a day, but the masses never come fully. Those who come early go back when they see no one, and those who come late don't care, so it takes half a day just to gather people for the meeting. Now you can't force them, so there's really no way." What should be done about this problem? Everyone studied that after the masses arrive, they can be inspired to discuss discipline, which everyone will abide by, and use democratic centralism to solve the problem. On the other hand, if discipline is decided on your own without discussing it with the masses, and you force the masses to implement it, this is interference and coercion. (3) Many village cadres believe that being a cadre is not rewarding, it delays work and offends the masses, and if you make a mistake, you will be scolded by your superiors. On this issue, it was not only pointed out that it is an honor to serve the masses as a village cadre, but also that as long as we sincerely serve the masses and consult with the masses on everything, we will not be opposed by the masses; some district cadres were criticized for their attitude of scolding people when village cadres encountered difficulties or made mistakes in leadership, instead of actively helping village cadres to find ways to overcome them, and they also acknowledged their mistakes. In particular, the work methods of village cadres were reviewed, and some methods were devised. (4) Some village cadres believe that if they have more serious mistakes, they are afraid that during land reform and party rectification, they will be beaten by landlords, lackeys, hooligans, and bad guys. On this issue, it was specifically emphasized that the democratic rectification of village cadres is basically about reforming and educating them, not attacking them. At the same time, the border government's decree that villages have no right to arrest or beat people was announced. This not only eliminated the village cadres' fear of being beaten to death, but also prevented the phenomenon of village cadres arbitrarily detaining and beating people in the village.

    清河三区开短期训练班讲明政策消除村干顾虑
    会后大家对领导生产有了办法
    踢开村干，单纯找贫雇调查村干错误。
    成天光想下台怕得罪了人
    当一天和尚撞一天钟
    【清河消息】清河三区于四月七、八、九三日召开四百八十六个村干部的短期训练班，初步解决村干的思想问题，布置春耕生产工作，兹将经过情形报导于后：在四月三号，三区工作团全体干部总结工作会上，大家检查最近各种工作非但不见起色，反而更形消沉。经大家检讨原因是：一、深入工作主要是访问贫雇，很少了解中农情况，而访贫雇又不是了解贫雇要求，生产中有何困难，如何分配果实等；而是单纯调查村干错误，为整党土改做准备，为调查而调查，故不能根据群众迫切要求而指导工作。二、踢开村干，躲着村干，四处找贫雇，使村干恐慌，群众也不知所措。如包里古庄的群众就说：“干部开会回来后同水蚊子一样，到处乱钻这是怎么回事呀！”被访群众听到打听村干消息，更是害怕；只有回答：“村干都好着哩。”村级组织不起作用，几个区干唱独脚戏，工作无成绩，区干也失望。一个同志说：“过去俺还会工作，现在也不知怎么做好了。”三、撤职了两个中队长和几个村干，未作宣传，致使村干们感到挨整下台的日子到了，工作不管不问，推推动动，甚而推也不动。这次会议开始，领导上首先说明这次对村干态度是改造教育，好的表扬，坏的批评，有错误的必须改正，同时表扬了积极工作的大辛庄农会主任毕云禄，指出积极领导群众生产，就是村干的出路。村干们听了都表示痛快，田村新干部说：“肚里没病是死不了人”。花园中队长说：“这给咱一个转变的好机会”。九号早晨村干部进行反省表明态度时，领导上采用了不拘形式的办法，随便扯，个人错误也好，对上级意见也好，不管多少有啥说啥，结果会场非常活跃。从大家的乱嚷嚷中可以看出有以下几种思想：一、恐慌不安，埋怨上级，不做工作。楼官庄小区代表刘至成反省说：“区里光往群众里钻，谁给咱谈谈呀，跟锄地一样，上级也得给起个头吧！咱这些天怎样想也没道路，光怕整党时被斗户、狗腿子和咱有成见的人联合起来打死咱，光想快下台呀，还管这个干啥呀”！东关中心支书唐三贵说：“区干整党回来后，一见面就说：看你们穿的军不军民不民的，对咱黑一眼白一眼的，根本不给咱谈啥，光钻贫雇，咱想这一定是到了整干部的时候了，自己光想过关的事，过去也好，过不去就被刷下来，但又怕坏人打死，每天心神不安。”二、当天和尚撞天钟。上有上级，下有下级，不管不行，管又怕群众说包办，深也不是浅也不是，是疙瘩就绊脚，多一事不如少一事。里古庄农会主任赵善卿说：“心里光害怕，不敢工作，叫实行民主哩，群众说是啥就是啥，区干好比织女，村干好比拖爬（织布机上用的），拉一拉动一动。”三、怕得罪人，干的工作多，得罪的人多，早晚闹个灰头土脸下台。中丁村司帐员潘莲身说：“越干的年头多，得罪的人越多，咱认为不对，群众说实行民主哩，怕不得罪群众哩！”村长冯克岭说：“净想把我这村长退了才好哩，一天撤了一天好，越快越好，我去大营送皮，本来一天的事，我故意待了三四天才回来，免得分果实时得罪人。”根据村干思想，总结时分别指出以下几个问题：（一）有少数村干仍抱着怀疑态度，如马厂村长韩凤德说：“上级这样讲，不是给咱捋捋毛顺把顺把，又使你一家伙，等到整党时再说。”领导上便重申对村干的态度与政策，说明这次会是要大家在思想上转过弯来，积极工作改正错误，了解群众意见，准备将来群众审查。（二）有些干部在讨论中认为“为工作错了不算错，为自己错了才算错”。总结时便指出为工作错了同样也是不应该的（当然在工作中也难免犯错，只要改正就行），因为犯了错误，群众就会受到损失。他们也想了些办法，譬如：“村里开会，用喇叭筒喊半天，群众老是来不齐，早的一见没人又回去了，来的晚的也没事，故开会光集合人得半天，现在又不能强迫，真没法。”象这个问题，怎么办呢？大家研究群众到齐后可以启发群众讨论纪律，大家遵守，民主集中方法解决问题，反之，如果不经群众讨论，而自己定出纪律来，硬叫群众执行，这就是包办强迫命令。（三）不少村干认为当干部没落头，既耽误活又得罪群众，做错了又挨上级训。在此问题上不仅提出当村干为群众服务是光荣的，只要我们真心为群众服务，凡事和群众商量，就不会遭到群众的反对；对某些区干在领导上村干遇着困难或做错了，不积极帮助村干想办法克服而要态度训人，也作了检讨承认了错误。特别是对村干的工作方法问题作了检讨，并想出了些办法。（四）有些村干认为较严重的错误，恐怕土改整党时，被斗户狗腿子流氓坏蛋联合起来打自己。对此问题特强调提出，民主整党对村干基本上是改造教育，而不是打击，同时又宣布了边区政府村无捕人打人权的法令，这样既可取消村干怕打死的顾虑，又可制止村干在村任意扣人打人的现象。
