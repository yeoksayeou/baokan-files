　　Workers Earned Wages
    Why Divide the "75 Red" Again?
  　Please, Xingtai City Trade Union, Investigate and Reply

To the Editor:
    Currently, our liberated areas are vigorously developing and supporting industry and commerce, and any measures that hinder the development of industry and commerce are not allowed. Here are some opinions regarding the Xingtai City Trade Union's perspective and policies on labor movements at the Qianjin Shoe Factory for your consideration.

    The Second Column of the Jinnan Military Region established a Shengli Shoe Workshop in Xingtai. After the military unit finished its production, it was transferred to the Jinnan Finance and Economics Office for leadership. This workshop undertook the task of making 100,000 pairs of military shoes for the Jinnan Administrative Office around May and June of last year. Because the task was huge, they requested the Trade Union to help recruit shoe-making workers or to jointly manage the operation. The Trade Union, seeing this as a way to solve the livelihood problems of many workers, jointly established the current Qianjin Shoe Factory with the Shengli Shoe Workshop. The organizational charter was based on the original Shengli Shoe Workshop's entire staff, workers, and all tools and property. Raw materials were purchased and tools were added using the advance grain payment for the military shoes (22 jin per pair, with half paid in advance). The Trade Union was responsible for recruiting workers. It was stipulated that the Shengli Shoe Workshop would receive 25 percent of the profits (after several negotiations), while the Trade Union, representing the interests of the workers, would receive 75 percent.

    Before the contract was signed, we felt that this distribution of profits between labor and capital was unreasonable and negotiated with Comrade Meng Pu, the chairman of the Trade Union. We believed that since the workers already received wages for their labor (and they were high), they should not also receive 75 percent of the profits in the partnership based on labor, and the interests of the capital side should be taken into account. Comrade Meng Pu replied that this was based on the initial proposal by Comrade Yuan Jiamin, one of the leaders of the Shengli Shoe Workshop, that if Shengli received 20 percent of the profits (Comrade Yuan Jiamin came from the military and had no experience in labor-capital cooperation), then it had to be done this way. It became a fixed decision, regardless of whether it was reasonable or not. What we proposed was used as the sole basis for negotiation. They simply said, "What you proposed cannot be changed; our Trade Union represents the interests of the workers, and no matter how much profit is distributed, it will be distributed to all the workers in the shoe factory, and the Trade Union will not take any." We suggested that since the workers were already earning wages, the profits could be divided 50/50. In the end, Shengli reduced its share to 40 percent, but it was not allowed. As a result, in order to complete the task, after several negotiations, it was changed to the Shengli Shoe Workshop receiving 25 percent of the profits. If there were losses, they would be borne in the same proportion as the profit sharing.

    In addition to profit sharing, the shoe-making workers were paid on a piece-rate wage system, earning wages every month. Generally, workers earned 350 jin of millet per month (including food), and the highest earners, such as sewing machine operators, earned 500 jin of millet per month (making a shoe mouth earned 0.5 jin of millet. Fifty pairs per day was the standard. If the speed was increased, 80 pairs could be completed per day, and the monthly wage could be 750 jin of millet). Therefore, workers could earn higher wages than general handicraft workers without increasing their production speed (at that time, other workshops hired workers for 100 jin of millet per month, excluding food).

    Comrade Meng Pu of the Trade Union is working for the welfare of the workers in Xingtai City. Ensuring that workers receive such wages and are not unemployed is an achievement. Why should these workers be given 75 percent of the profits? Could it be that the work of the Trade Union only represents the interests of this part of the workers and is divorced from representing the revolutionary interests of the entire working people? Why not allow the Shengli Shoe Workshop, which represents the interests of the millions of people in Jinnan, to receive a larger share of the profits? We believe this view and practice are wrong.

    Moreover, during the profit-sharing period, they tried every means to reduce the share of Shengli Shoe Workshop; even the worker education funds that were not spent last year were completely spent for future expenses (Shengli announced its termination and sole operation by the Trade Union). In daily education work, Jin, the supervisor of the Qianjin Factory (sent by the trade union, name unknown), used the fact that Shengli Shoe Workshop was a capitalist to educate the workers on how they exploited them, and there was an atmosphere of mobilizing workers to struggle against the cadres of Shengli Shoe Workshop. Therefore, the cadres of Shengli Shoe Workshop were marginalized in the factory. This led to many disputes over the merger issue and profit-sharing issue, which could not be reasonably resolved and were justified by the claim of safeguarding the interests of the workers.

    Such a labor movement policy hinders labor-capital cooperation and industrial development. It is a narrow-minded, charitable view, or it treats the Jinnan and Taihang regions as opposing each other, failing to start from the overall revolutionary interests. Therefore, we raise it for study. We hope to be corrected if we are wrong.

### 工人赚了工资  为何又分七五红　请邢台市职工会检查答复

　　工人赚了工资
    为何又分七五红
  　请邢台市职工会检查答复编辑同志：
    目前我们解放区内正在大力发展与扶助工商业，一切妨碍工商业发展的措施，都是不允许的。兹将邢台市职工会对前进鞋工厂的工运观点与方针提供一点意见以供研究。
    冀南二纵队部队在邢台开设胜利鞋庄一座。部队生产结束，转交冀南财经办事处领导。该号于去年五、六月间承做冀南行署军鞋十万双。因任务很大，向职工会要求代为征集做鞋工人，或合伙经营。职工会亦因为这一来能够解决很多工人的生活问题，即与胜利鞋庄合组了现在的前进鞋工厂。组织章程，是以原胜利鞋庄的全体干部、工人与一切工具财产为基础，再以所承做军鞋之预交粮（每双鞋二十二斤先交半数），采购原料，添置工具，进行生产，职工会负召集工人的责任。规定胜利鞋庄以百分之二十五（几次交涉的），职工会代表工人利益，以百分之七五的比例分红。
    合同订立前，我们觉得这样规定的劳资分红不合理，向职工会主席孟普同志交涉。我们认为工人已经有了劳动所应得的工资（并且很高），即不应又在合伙中占百分之七十五的劳力分红，应该照顾资方利益。孟普同志答复，是根据我们胜利鞋庄负责人之一苑嘉民同志在初次商谈中所提出的若胜利按百分之二十分红（苑嘉民同志是部队上来的没有搞过劳资合作），就得按这样办，成了固定的决议，合理与否一概不管了。我们提错了，就作了唯一谈判的根据。只是说：“你们提的，不能再改；我们职工会是代表工人利益的，不论分多少红，都要分给鞋工厂的一切工人，职工会一点也不要。”我们提出工人既赚有工资。可各按百分之五十分红。最后胜利退至百分之四十，均没允许。结果为了必须完成任务，经过数次的交涉，才改为胜利鞋庄以百分之二十五分红。如赔损，与分红同样负担。
    做鞋工人除分红外，是按计件工资制，每月赚有工资的。一般工人每月赚小米三百五十斤（伙食在内），最高的如缝纫机工人，每月赚小米五百斤（做一双鞋口，工资米五两。每天以五十双为标准。若是速度加快，每天能完成八十双的，则每月可赚工资米七百五十斤）。因此，工人生产速度不用提高，即可赚到高于一般手工业工人的工资了（当时其他作坊雇用工人每月小米一百斤，伙食在外）。
    职工会孟普同志是为邢台市的工人谋福利的。使工人得到这样的工资与不失业，是已经作到应有的成绩了；为何又要给这些工人以七五的分红呢？莫非职工会的工作只是代表这一部分工人的利益，脱离了代表整个劳动人民的革命利益了吗？为何不叫代表冀南千百万人民群众利益的胜利鞋庄多分些红呢？我们认为这个观点与作法是错误的。
    并且在分红期间，想尽方法来减少胜利鞋庄的分红；把去年没有开支了的工人教育费也完全支出来作今后的花费（胜利宣布结束由职工会独营）。在日常教育工作中，前进工厂之靳监委（工会派去，不知何名）以胜利鞋庄是资本家，如何剥削工人等来教育工人，还有发动工人斗争胜利鞋庄干部的空气。因此胜利鞋庄干部在工厂是受到排挤的。以至联系到合并问题与分红问题，有很多纠纷没有得到合理的解决，都在维护工人利益的说法下面讲不通了。
    这样的工运方针，是妨害着劳资合作与工业发展的，是狭隘的恩赐观点，或者是把冀南与太行两个区域看成是对立的，没有从革命利益的整体出发。因此我们提出来作一研究。是否正确，希望指正。
