Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 9th: The masses along the Longhai Railway between Luoyang and Zhengzhou have been subjected to the Kuomintang bandits' rape, arson, and murder. In late March, the bandit 11th and 38th Divisions, fleeing eastward, extorted grain and fodder in Dongluo'ao Village, more than twenty miles southeast of Luoyang, looting rampantly and raping more than ten women. Liu Shiru, a fourteen-year-old girl, was also gang-raped. A farmer, surnamed Ren, who was hiding in the attic of his house, saw two bandits trying to rape his wife. In extreme anger, he jumped down and killed one bandit with a kitchen knife. The other bandit fled, losing an arm in the process. At this time, the farmers of the entire village had gathered and shouted to beat the bandits, scaring them away. The next day, the bandits gathered more than fifty men to retaliate. The entire village rose up in resistance, fighting fiercely for more than two hours, wounding three bandits and driving them back. On the third day, the Kuomintang bandits brought a company to besiege the village. The villagers, outnumbered, were forced to move. The bandits then looted every household and set fire to more than 170 houses, burning five infants to death. Luo Si's wife, from the west of the village, was unable to run due to being in labor, and was burned to death along with her infant. Chen Gengyi's wife, from the east of the village, dropped her baby when being chased by five Kuomintang bandits, and the baby was also killed by the bandits. When the People's Liberation Army advanced eastward and passed through the village, the sixty-year-old Ren Ting, with tears in his eyes, pointed to the broken walls and ruins and said, "Comrades, how can we survive? The people can only rely on you!" The daughter-in-law of the Liu family, whose child was burned to death, cried and pleaded with the soldiers to avenge him. The merchants of Sishui all called the Kuomintang bandits "scorch earth squads." During the period when the Kuomintang bandits occupied the area, the merchants suffered from excessive levies and taxes. All the large and small shops in the city had gone on strike since the lunar New Year, and persisted until this liberation. The farmers collectively resisted grain and taxes. In Gubaizui Village, Yumen Township, because the grain and tax burden was too heavy, the farmers all handed over their land deeds and refused to cultivate the land. Wu Guanying, the Kuomintang bandit county magistrate, detained the township chief, so dozens of villages handed over their land deeds, leaving Wu with no recourse. When the Kuomintang bandit 47th Division in Xingyang retreated towards Zhengzhou, they set up machine guns on the city walls and forced the masses to leave their homes, then searched every household. The residents hated them to the bone.

    陇海沿线惨遭蒋匪洗劫
    群众请求我军报仇
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线九日电】洛阳、郑州间陇海沿线群众，惨遭蒋匪奸淫烧杀。三月下旬东窜匪十一师、卅八师在洛阳东南二十余里东罗凹村勒索粮草，大肆抢劫，并强奸妇女十余名，十四岁女孩刘世汝亦遭轮奸。农民任某当时躲在屋内顶棚上，见有两匪徒欲强奸其妻，愤极跳下，用菜刀杀死一匪，另一匪夺门逃走，被砍下一条膀子。此时全村农民亦已群集喊打，乃将匪军吓跑。次日匪纠合五十余人来报复，全村奋起抵抗，激战两时余，击伤匪三名，将匪逐退。第三天蒋匪开来一个连围攻，村民势孤被迫转移，匪即挨户洗劫，并纵火烧毁民房一百七十余间，烧死婴儿五名。村西罗思的妻子因在产期跑不动，连同婴儿惨遭焚毙。村东陈庚义的妻子被五名蒋匪追赶时，丢下的娃娃亦被匪徒杀害。当解放军向东进军行经该村时，六十多岁的任亭老人指着断墙残壁眼泪盈眶的说：“同志呀怎么活下去呢，老百姓只有指望你们了。”被烧死了孩子的刘家媳妇，哭着请求战士们一定要给他报仇。汜水商民均称蒋匪为“扫光队”，在蒋匪盘踞期间，商民不堪横征暴敛，城内大小商店曾自阴历年关起即全部罢市，一直坚持到此次解放。农民们则集体抗粮抗捐，禹门乡孤柏嘴村因粮款过重，农民均交出地契不愿耕种，蒋匪县长吴贯英扣押了乡保长，于是几十个村都交地契，使吴匪毫无办法。荥阳蒋匪四十七师向郑州逃退时，在城头架设机枪，强迫群众离家，然后挨家搜劫，居民无不恨之入骨。
