Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 24th—A large number of literary and art workers from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are about to rush to the front lines to follow the People's Liberation Army in attacking the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The People's Theater Troupe, the Northwest Literary and Art Work Troupe's first and second groups, and the Joint Government Propaganda Team are all preparing to depart. When the Hu bandits attacked Yan'an last year, the Literary Association working group set off for Shaanxi and Gansu, the Northwest Literary and Art Work Troupe set off for Guanzhong, the Joint Government Propaganda Team set off for Longdong, and the People's Theater Troupe and the filmstrip working group also set off for various places one after another. They combined with local and military literary and art workers to serve the people with their creations, songs, pictures, and various propaganda materials. Over the past year, the first group of the Northwest Literary and Art Work Troupe has traveled with the army to perform dramas such as "Invincible Militia" and "Red Headband," traveling 5,200 miles along the front lines. The second group (formerly the Suide Cultural Work Troupe) performed more than a dozen plays reflecting the war and war service in the rural areas of the Suide sub-district, such as "Double Revenge" and "Who Do You Think I Am?". The People's Theater Troupe has been touring the troops since the early stages of the war, performing the most popular plays among soldiers, such as "Blood and Tears of Hatred," "Defend Peace," and "Poor People's Hatred." The filmstrip working group created more than 20 sets of filmstrips such as "Gao Yanxi," "Execution of Traitorous Culprits," "Hu Bandit Atrocities," and "Liberation Heroes," with the most extensive set reaching more than 40 frames, performed among troops and rural masses, and were warmly welcomed. When the second group of the Northwest Literary and Art Work Troupe performed "Who Do You Think I Am?" for the guerrillas, they had no costumes, so the actors turned their own clothes and hats inside out and wore them on stage, and then used explanations to help the audience understand the plot. The guerrillas and rural masses, who were extremely lacking in cultural sustenance, were thus encouraged and entertained. During emergency transfers, the comrades of the second group carried not only their luggage but also gas lamps and curtains. During the Yangma River battle, the People's Theater Troupe became a stretcher team, carrying the wounded and transporting spoils of war. The first group led the masses in Guanzhong to harvest wheat, and did not stop working even when shells exploded nearby. The second group helped evacuate grain, manufacture landmines, and even participated in combat and captured machine guns. Literary and art workers in the border area, whether at the front or in the rear, have received practical education and training. After recent land reform studies and short-term rectification, they will set off for the new areas with new strides.

　　陕甘宁文艺工作者大批赶赴前线工作
    【新华社西北二十四日电】陕甘宁边区大批文艺工作者即将赶赴前线，随解放军出击蒋管区。民众剧团、西北文艺工作团第一、二团、联政宣传队等已在整装待发。当去年胡匪进攻延安时，文协工作组即向陕甘一带出发，西北文艺工作团向关中出发，联政宣传队向陇东出发，民众剧团和洋片工作组亦先后出发各地。他们与地方和部队中的文艺工作者结合，以他们的创作、歌曲、图画和各种宣传品为人民服务。一年来西北文艺工作团第一团随军出演“无敌民兵”、“红布条”等戏剧，辗转前线，行程达五千二百多里。第二团（原绥德文工团）在绥德分区农村中演出“双报仇”、“你看我是谁”等十余个反映战争与战勤的剧本。民众剧团从战争初期中一直在部队中巡回演出最受战士欢迎的“血泪仇”、“保卫和平”与“穷人恨”等剧本。洋片工作组创制了“高彦喜”、“枪毙投敌罪魁”、“胡匪暴行”、“解放英雄”等二十多套洋片，最多的一套达四十余幅，在部队与农村群众中演唱，受到热烈欢迎。西北文艺工作团第二团给游击队演出“你看我是谁”时，没有服装，演员们就把自己身上穿的衣帽翻过来穿出场，再借助在旁的说明，帮助观众了解剧情，极端缺乏文化食粮的游击队和农村群众因而得到了鼓舞与娱乐。在紧急转移时，二团同志除自背行李外还背上汽灯、布幕等。民众剧团在羊马河战斗中，就成了担架队，抬运伤员，搬运战利品。一团在关中领导群众麦收，虽炮弹在近旁炸开也未停工。二团帮助疏散粮食，制造地雷，更实际参加战斗而缴获机枪。边区文艺工作者不论在前方后方，都受到了实际的教育和锻炼，最近又经过土改学习和短期整训，他们将以新的步伐向新区出发。
