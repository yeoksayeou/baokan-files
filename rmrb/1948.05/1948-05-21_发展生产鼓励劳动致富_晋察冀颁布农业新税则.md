Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 15th: The Border Region Administrative Committee recently issued a proclamation abolishing the progressive agricultural tax and replacing it with a proportional tax system without progressive rates. The proclamation stated: The purpose of land reform is to eliminate feudalism and develop production. In villages where land reform has been completed, the feudal system has been eliminated, and the vast number of farmers have obtained considerable land and other means of production. In this new situation, the unified progressive tax regulations previously implemented in the border region are no longer applicable and have been declared void. The Committee has sent work teams to various places to conduct investigations and research, and to widely solicit opinions from people's representative conferences and people from all walks of life, preparing to formulate new tax regulations suitable for the current situation. However, it will take considerable time to formally formulate them. The main principles for future regulations are now announced as follows: (1) In villages where land has been equally distributed and the land owned by people of all classes has largely reached an equal distribution, the progressive tax system will be abolished and replaced with a proportional tax system without progression, so that people who produce more can benefit more. (2) The tax rate and the amount collected for agricultural tax shall be calculated based on the average annual yield of each piece of land, not based on the actual yield of the year. Any income increased due to diligent labor, increased fertilization, watering, deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, improved crops, etc., that is, income exceeding the average annual yield of the land, will not be subject to increased burden, in order to reward labor and increase production. In the event of crop failure due to famine years or other irresistible disasters, the government may酌量 reduce or exempt taxes. (3) Balance the burden in various regions. In the past, the burden was unbalanced in various regions, with some places having a light burden and some places having a heavy burden. This year, adjustments will be made to achieve balance as much as possible. (4) Starting from the next year, village funds will be collected and spent uniformly by the Border Region Government. In the past, there were many villages with serious waste in village finances, and the burden was also unbalanced. In order to overcome waste and reduce the burden on the people, it is decided that the Border Region Government will uniformly collect and spend funds starting from this autumn. (5) In the future, in addition to the formal taxes stipulated by the Border Region Government, governments at all levels and other institutions shall not levy any additional taxes.

　　发展生产鼓励劳动致富
  　晋察冀颁布农业新税则
    【新华社晋察冀十五日电】边区行政委员会顷布告废除农业累进税改用无累进率之比例税收制，布告称：土地改革的目的是为了消灭封建，发展生产，在土地改革业已完成的村庄，封建制度已经消灭，广大农民已获得相当之土地及其他生产资料，今后如能努力劳动，就可能发家致富。在此新的情况下，边区过去所实行的统一累进税税则已不适用并已宣告作废。本会已派工作团到各地进行调查研究，向各地人民代表会议及各阶层人民广泛征求意见，准备制定适合当前情况的新税则，惟尚须相当时间方能正式制定。兹先将今后规定新税则的主要原则宣布如下：（一）凡土地已经实行平分，各阶层人民所有土地已大体达到平分的村庄，一律废除累进税制，改用无累进之比例税收制，使人民多生产者能多得利。（二）农业税分数与征收数量一律按各块土地常年平均产量计算，不按当年实际产量计算。凡因勤苦劳动或多上粪、多浇水、深耕细作、改良作物等所增加之收入，即超过土地常年平均产量之收入，一律不增加负担，以奖励劳动，增加生产。在荒年及其他不可抗的打击，因而歉收的情况下，得由政府酌量减收或免收。（三）平衡各地负担。过去各地区负担不平衡，有些地方负担轻，有些地方负担重，今年要加以调剂，尽量做到平衡。（四）自下年度起，村款由边区政府统一征收开支，过去有许多村庄村财政的浪费现象很严重，负担也不平衡。为克服浪费减轻人民负担，决定自本年秋后开始由边区政府统一收支。（五）今后除边区政府规定之正式税收外，各级政府及其他任何机构不得再有额外征收。
