　　The Revival of the Grass Braiding Industry in the Ji-Lu-Yu Region
　　Ji-Lu-Yu Branch
　　　　I. Overview and History of the Ji-Lu-Yu Grass Braiding Industry

The area in the Ji-Lu-Yu region that produces grass braids is centered around Xian Zhuangji in Qingfeng's Fifth District (also known as Grass Hat Xian Zhuang). It extends 70 li east to Fan County, 40 li west to Hancun, 50 li south to Pu County, and 60 li north to Shuguan. The total area is 12,000 square li, with 100 li to the northeast and 70 li to the northwest.

The braid-producing area has a population of 1.2 to 1.5 million, with 300,000 to 350,000 braiding. Assuming each person braids a minimum of 10 tuo per day, the daily output is 120 bundles of braids (each bundle containing 240 braids, each braid being 120 yards long). Assuming braiding takes place for ten months each year, the annual output is 30,000 to 40,000 bundles. The value of the braids, converted to coarse grains, is 39 million to 42 million jin.

The grass braiding industry has a history of approximately 200 years. It began in Xian Zhuangji, hence its name "Grass Hat Xian Zhuang." Initially, merchants from Henan established hat shops in Xian Zhuangji, selling grass hats to Hankou, and then to Guangdong and Guangxi. Consequently, merchants from Guangdong also came to Xian Zhuangji to set up shops and buy grass hats. During the Xianfeng era, Xian Zhuangji already had three hat shops (two from Guangdong, one from Henan). Later, the hat shops developed into braid shops, purchasing large quantities of grass braids. By the Tongzhi era, braids were already being exported. In 1912, German and Japanese merchants established shops in Qingdao to purchase grass braids, leading to an increase in foreign braid shops in the braid-producing area. There were 32 in Xian Zhuangji, 48 in Nanle City, 20 in Hanzhang, and 11 in Chaocheng.

The industry reached its most prosperous stage in 1935 and 1936. During the War of Resistance against Japan, due to the impact of the war and the inability to export, the braiding industry began to decline and collapse.

1935 was the most prosperous year in the history of the braiding industry. Xian Zhuangji had more than 20 braid shops, larger than those in 1912. The three largest braid shops alone purchased braids worth 4,500 yuan daily. All 20 shops together purchased 9,000 yuan worth of braids per day (equivalent to 1,400 shi or over 370,000 jin of coarse grains). The braid shops purchased 30,000 to 40,000 bundles of grass braids throughout the year (mostly for export).

At this time, coarse braids sold for 100 yuan per bundle, while fine braids sold for 500 yuan per bundle. Coarse braids sold for two copper coins per tuo. Elderly women in their fifties and young girls who had just learned to braid could each braid 40 tuo per day, earning 800 coins, enough to buy six jin of coarse grains. The average person could braid 40 tuo of medium-quality braids per day, earning two strings of cash, enough to buy sixteen jin and six liang of coarse grains. Skilled women could braid 30 tuo of fine braids per day, earning three strings of cash, enough to buy twenty-five jin of coarse grains. Two workers, typically disabled individuals, could braid 60 braids per day, earning five copper coins per braid, totaling three strings of cash, enough to buy twenty-five jin of coarse grains, or twelve and a half jin per person. General porters earned an annual salary of 120 yuan. Furthermore, due to the wide sales channels and increased braid prices, the enthusiasm for production among braiders was greatly stimulated. Women braided all day, and at night, to save lamp oil, they would freely form groups, gathering around a single oil lamp, talking and laughing to avoid falling asleep. They also held competitions to see who could braid more and better. Sometimes, if they got sleepy, they would rest near the lamp for a while, and then continue braiding until dawn. Many women didn't even want to waste time cooking, buying quick meals when they were hungry and then continuing to braid. Some tasks that were originally done by women were taken over by men to avoid affecting their production. If a family had a woman who could braid well, they would not ask her to do any other work, but only to braid. As a result, women's political and economic status in the family improved, and men rarely subjected them to feudal oppression.

With the prosperity of the braiding industry and the increase in people's purchasing power, other businesses also developed. First, the number of small vendors increased significantly. In populous villages, the evenings were as lively as market days. Xian Zhuangji flourished, with three merchants having capital over 10,000 yuan, four having over 5,000 yuan, and twenty-one having over 2,000 yuan. There were foreign thread shops, foreign cloth shops, paint companies, money lending shops, bathhouses, tea houses, and restaurants. The seven employees of the Kui Sheng Lou restaurant were busy all day, serving an average of 80 customers and selling 200 dishes (15 cents per dish), and workers' living standards greatly improved. In general, women couldn't be found wearing any coarse cloth.

　　　　II. Leftist Recklessness Impacts the Decline of the Braiding Industry

Before the land reform last year, there were a total of thirteen braid shops in the braid-producing area, including four Tianjin shops, eight local private shops, and one public shop. Due to the following reasons, the braid shops collapsed, and the braiding industry declined.

First, the land reform impacted them. The four Tianjin braid shops, fearing struggle sessions, moved back to Tianjin early. Seven of the eight local private braid shops were subjected to struggle sessions (it is unclear whether the other was struggled against), leaving only one public braid shop. The public braid shop stopped operating because it could not sell the braids it had purchased.

Second, private braid shops were unprofitable. First, braid shops did not have the freedom to employ workers. Comrades in the public braid shop mistakenly believed that struggling against braid shops from Tianjin was the same as struggling against the enemy. In the past, braid shops had the freedom to employ workers, selecting them based on their skill level and determining wages based on their proficiency. At this time, they were no longer in charge, and the chairman of the labor union randomly sent workers to the braid shops. These workers were often family members of revolutionary martyrs or poor peasants. The braid shops were treated as institutions for supporting revolutionary martyrs and resolving the livelihood issues of poor peasants. The ×× braid shop had only one skilled veteran craftsman, with the rest being semi-skilled or novice. The braid twisters were mostly elderly people and young children, and other shops even had village cadres. If they were paid per piece, they would rush to twist braids quickly just to earn more money for themselves, without producing quality work. If they were paid daily, they would loaf on the job, starting late and finishing early. In particular, village cadres often attended meetings, missing a whole morning of work but still receiving wages from the employer, who did not dare to complain. Second, wages were high. Wages were generally determined through negotiations between the public braid shop and the labor union, and private braid shops had no say. Wages were based on coarse grains. Twisting one coarse braid earned one he and eight ge of coarse grains. Generally, two people could twist 60 coarse braids per day, totaling one dou and eight he of coarse grains, with each person receiving five sheng and four he of grain. For fine braids, two people could twist 40 braids per day, earning one dou and six sheng of grain, with each person receiving eight sheng per day, equivalent to over 20 jin. However, a braider could only braid up to 210 yuan worth of braids in a day, enough to buy just over one jin of coarse grains. Therefore, a braid twister earned wages equivalent to over 20 braiders. In comparison, the wages of braid twisters were too high. Third, transportation was restricted. Public braid shops could use boats for transportation on the Wei River, but after village cadres organized oxcarts, they insisted that people use their oxcarts for transportation. Private braid shops, fearing offending them, dared not refuse, so private braid shops spent 15,000 yuan more per trip than public braid shops. Furthermore, due to inspections along the way during transportation, a lot of travel time was often wasted. Once, the oxcarts of the Liaocheng carriage company unloaded the braids halfway, causing more trouble and transportation expenses for the owner. Fourth, transportation costs were 15,000 yuan more per bundle, and food expenses were 10,000 yuan more. Because the public braid shop competed with them, each private shop had to spend 10,000 yuan more to buy a bundle of braids. The poor quality of the work done by porters and twisters resulted in 15,000 yuan less being earned per bundle in Tianjin. The braid shops paid 60,000 yuan in interest on loans from the Tianjin bank. Overall, each bundle of braids cost private shops 110,000 yuan more than the public shops or earned them less profit (not including travel expenses, business tax, and compensation for oxcart losses). Private braid shops were unprofitable economically and lacked political freedom, so they left the liberated area. Gao Shuyou from the Tianjin braid shops was the last to leave. Before leaving, he said: "I don't want to leave either, but I have no choice now. There's no way out."

With the Tianjin braid shops gone, the local private braid shops struggled against, and the public braid shops closed, the entire braiding industry declined, naturally greatly affecting the lives of workers and the masses.

　　　　III. The Braiding Industry Begins to Revive!

After the Central Committee and the Central Bureau issued policies on industry and commerce, leaders at all levels began to examine and correct past leftist errors, resolutely restoring and developing the grass braiding industry. The public braid shop found ways to connect with braid shops in Tianjin, promoted our Party's policies on industry and commerce, and specifically corrected past leftist errors, supporting Cui Jianshan, the local private braid shop, by selling him 180 bundles of braids at a low price to sell in Tianjin. They earned a third of the profits per bundle. Tianjin merchants saw that the liberated area's policies on industry and commerce had truly changed, so Tianjin merchant Zhang Congxian and four other local braid shops, including Tian Fuhao, successively set up shops in our region to buy braids. Kou Futing, a manager from Tianjin's Huaxing Firm, came to the liberated area in January this year. He said: "The liberated area is so good, you can walk around at night with money and no thieves will rob you. I only heard it was good in the past, but I didn't believe it in my heart. Now I really believe it. I'll move my family to the liberated area in the future and not live in the KMT-controlled area."

All the cadres in Qingfeng's Fifth District also ideologically examined past leftist errors in their understanding of private braid shops. On the 28th of last month, they convened a meeting of managers from various braid shops, explaining the policy of resolutely protecting industry and commerce, examining past errors, and soliciting their opinions. On the 30th, they convened a mass meeting of the entire village of Xian Zhuangji, calling on people to improve the quality of braids and strive to export more. They also opposed past errors of randomly sending workers, producing shoddy goods, only caring about earning wages for themselves, and disregarding the interests of the braid shops. They called for technical competitions in the future, opposing relying on good class background and the status of being family members of revolutionary martyrs to not work hard; promoting careful and precise work for porters, proper classification, good twisting for twisters, good joining of braids, and reducing braid waste.

The next day, District Chief Qin and managers from private braid shops visited the Tongfeng (public) braid shop to observe the work situation. Everyone saw with their own eyes that the workers were working much better than before and the quality had improved significantly. The private managers happily said: "This bundle of braids will sell for much more than before, and it will be easier to sell." Private braid shops used to have ideological concerns and were afraid to express their opinions or make long-term plans. Now they dare to express their opinions and are making long-term plans. They have also finalized long-term leases for renting houses.

Note: The District Party Committee and the Administrative Office are discussing and researching specific guidelines for restoring and developing the braiding industry.

　　冀鲁豫草帽辫业的复活
    冀鲁豫分社
    　　　　一、冀鲁豫草帽辫业的概况与历史
    冀鲁豫区出产草帽辫子的地区，以清丰五区仙庄集（又名草帽子仙庄）为中心，东至范县七十里，西至韩村四十里，南至濮县五十里，北至束馆六十里。东北有一百里，西北有七十里，总面积为一万二千方里。
    产辫区域共有人口一百二十万至一百五十万，编辫人口三十万至三十五万。按每人一天最少编十托计算，每天可出产辫子一百二十包（每包二百四十把，每把一百二十码）。按每年十个月的编辫时间算，全年产辫三万至四万包。辫价折合成粗粮，为三千九百万斤至四千二百万斤。
    草帽辫业约有二百多年历史。开始是在仙庄集出产，故仙庄集又名草帽子仙庄。起初有河南商人在仙庄集安设帽庄，草帽推销到汉口，又到广东、广西，所以广东商人也来仙庄集设庄，收买草帽。咸丰年间，仙庄集已经有了三家帽庄（广东的两家、河南的一家）。后来又由帽庄发展到辫庄，收买大批草帽辫。辫子于同治年间已开始出口。民国元年，德日商人在青岛设庄收买草帽辫，所以产辫区增加了许多外来辫庄。计仙庄集三十二家，南乐城里四十八家，韩张二十家，朝城十一家。
    民国二十四、五年，发展到最繁荣的阶段。抗战时期，由于战争影响，不能出口，辫业开始走向萧条与垮台。
    民国二十四年是辫业有史以来最繁荣的年代。仙庄集有辫庄二十多家，比民国元年的庄大。仅三家最大的辫庄，每天就收买四千五百元的辫子。二十家一天共买九千元的辫子（折合粗粮一千四百石或三十七万多斤）。辫庄全年（按十个月计）就收买到三万至四万包草帽辫（大部出口）。
    此时粗辫子卖一百元一包，细的一包五百元。粗辫子两个铜子一托。五十多岁的老太太和刚学会编辫子的小女孩子，每人每天能编四十托，可卖八百钱，能买六斤粗粮。一般人一天能编中等辫子四十托，卖两吊钱，能买十六斤六两粗粮。技术高的妇女一天能编三十托细辫子，卖三吊钱，能买二十五斤粗粮。两个工人，一般拐子，一天可拐六十把，拐辫一把五个铜子，一天能拐三吊钱，买粗粮二十五斤，每人合十二斤半粮食。一般的挑工，工资一年一百二十元。另外由于销路广和辫价的提高，大大刺激了编辫者的生产情绪。妇女们白天编一天，晚上为了节少灯油，就自由结合成小组，大家围绕着一盏油灯，又说又笑，防止瞌睡。并且提出竞赛，看谁编的多，编的好。有时瞌睡了，就在灯旁休息一会，醒来以后，还是编。一直到天明。很多妇女连做饭的时间也啥不得耽误，到饿了就买点便饭吃，吃了再编。有些本来是妇女做的活，但是男人们都替她们干了，以免影响她们的生产。谁家如果是有个编好辫子的妇女，就别的啥活也不叫她做，专门叫她编。因此，妇女在家庭的政治经济地位提高了，男人们很少对她们有封建压迫。
    辫业繁荣，人们购买力提高，其他商业也随着发展起来。首先是增加了很多小商贩。在人口多的村庄，每到夜晚，犹如集市一般热闹。仙庄集繁荣起来，资本在一万元以上的座商三家，五千元以上的四家，两千元以上的二十一家。有洋线庄、洋布庄，颜料公司，揭钱铺，洗澡塘，茶、饭馆等。魁盛楼饭馆的七个伙计整天没闲空，平均一天能招待八十个客人，卖到二百个菜（一个菜一角五分），工人们的生活水平大大提高。一般妇女浑身找不到一点粗布。
    　　　　二、左倾蛮干影响辫业萧条
    去年土地改革以前，在产辫区共有十三家辫庄，包括天津庄四家，本地私营庄八家，公营庄一家。由于以下各种原因，致使辫庄垮台，辫业走向萧条。
    首先是土地改革给他们的影响。天津的四家辫庄，因为怕被斗争，早早的搬回天津去了。八家本地私营辫庄，有七家被斗争了（另外一家被斗争否，情况不明），只剩下了一家公营辫庄。公营辫庄因买了辫子无法推销，也停止营业。
    其次是私营辫庄无利可图。第一、辫庄任用工人不自由，公营辫庄的同志错误的认为和天津来的辫庄斗争就是跟敌人斗争。过去辫庄上任用工人是自由的，他们可以根据技术的高低挑选工人，根据技术的好坏规定工资；这时候，他们不当家了，工人由工会主任随便往辫庄上送，被送工人的条件多是抗属或贫农。把辫庄当成了优抗和解决贫农生活的机关。××辫庄上的手工工人，只有一个技术熟练的老手，其他都是半工手和新手。拐工工人多是些老头子和小孩子，其他庄上还有村干部。如果是按件计工的话，他们光是为了自己多混钱，拐辫子很快，不出好活；如果按日计工，他们又磨洋工，上工晚，下工早。特别是村干部常开会，开一晌的会就一天不上工，但仍一样向资方领取工资，资方也不敢哼气。第二、工资高。规定工资一般的都是公营辫庄与工会协商的；私营辫庄无权过问。工资以粗粮为标准，拐工拐一把粗辫子一合八粗粮，一天两个人一般的拐六十把，合粗粮一斗零八合，每人得粮食五升四合。细辫子一天两个人拐四十把，工资粮一斗六升，每人一天得八升，合二十多斤。可是一个编辫子的妇女，顶多一天能编二百一十元，才买一斤多粗粮。这样，一个拐辫子的工人工资就顶二十多个编辫子的妇女得的工资。相形之下，拐工的工资是太高了。第三、运输受限制。公营辫庄可以在卫河里用船运输，而村干部的大车组织起来后，硬叫人家用他们的大车运输。私营辫庄怕得罪他们，不敢不用，所以私人辫庄每运一车，比公营辫庄多花一万五千元。又因运输时沿途被盘查，常常耽误很多走路时间。有一次，聊城车行的大车，把辫子给人家拉到半路上就卸车了，使人家又麻烦，又多化运输费。第四、运输费每一包多花一万五千元，伙食费多花一万元。由于公营辫庄与他竞争，所以每买一包辫子，他得多花一万元。挑工拐工做的活不好，辫子到天津少卖钱一万五千元。辫庄在天津银行贷款付息六万元。总起来私营辫庄每一包辫子比公营庄就增加成本或少赚红利十一万元（人员的来往路费、营业税、赔偿大车损失等尚不包括在内）。私营辫庄经济上无利可图，政治上又不自由，就离开了解放区。天津的四家辫庄，以高书尧走的最晚。他临走时说：“俺也不愿走，现在不走不行啦。十条路没一条路啦。”
    天津的辫庄搬走了，本地的私营辫庄被斗争了，公营辫庄也停止了，整个的辫业萧条了，工人和群众的生活自然也受到极大影响。
    　　　　三、辫业开始复活！
    中央及中央局对工商业的政策颁发以后，各级领导上已开始检查纠正过去的左倾错误，坚决恢复与发展草帽辫业。公营辫庄想办法与天津辫庄接上了关系，宣传了我党的工商业政策，并对过去的左倾错误进行具体纠正，支持了本地私营辫庄崔建善，低价卖给他一百八十包辫子，到天津去推销。每一包他们赚到了三分之一的红利。天津的商人看到了解放区的工商政策真正转变了，所以津商张从先和本地天孚号辫庄等四家相继在我区设庄买辫。天津华兴行的先生寇福廷，在今年正月间来解放区。他说：“解放区真好，夜里拿着钱走路也没小偷抢你的。过去光是听说好，但心里不相信，现在才真信啦。以后把我的家也搬到解放区来，不在蒋管区住啦。”
    清丰五区的全体干部，也从思想上检查了过去对私营辫庄认识的左倾错误，又于上月二十八日召开各辫庄经理会议，说明坚决保护工商业的政策，并检查了过去的错误，征求了他们的意见。三十日又召开仙庄集全村群众大会，号召提高辫子的质量，争取多出口。并反对过去胡乱送工人、粗制滥造、只顾自己赚工资，不管辫庄利益的错误。号召今后从技术上竞赛，反对依靠自己成份好和军烈属资格，不好好做工；提倡挑工工作要精致细密，分类要分的好，拐工要拐的好，接头接的好，少舍辫子。
    第二天，秦区长又协同私营辫庄经理到同丰（公营）辫庄上参观工作情形，大家都亲眼见到工人工作比以前好多了，质量提高了许多。私营经理很高兴的说：“这比以前一包辫子得多卖好多钱，还好出手。”私营辫庄过去思想上有顾虑，不敢提意见，不敢长期打算，现在敢提意见了，也从长远方面打算开了。赁房子也定下了长期租赁。
    附注：区党委与行署对恢复与发展辫业的具体方针正在讨论研究中。
