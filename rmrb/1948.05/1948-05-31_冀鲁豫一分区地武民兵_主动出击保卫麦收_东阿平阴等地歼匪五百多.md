[Jilu Yu, 25th Dispatch] The local armed forces and militia of the First Military Sub-district are actively attacking the enemy to defend the wheat harvest. Recently, the Jiang bandit Shandong Security Brigade sneaked into the Dong'a and Pingyin areas, colluding with more than 2,000 local bandits, preparing to loot wheat. The local armed forces of our First Military Sub-district actively and proactively launched attacks to protect the safety of the masses and the wheat harvest. On May 20, the pseudo-bandit district headquarters was annihilated at Wangkou Mountain, northeast of Pingyin. On the 21st, they were attacked near Pingyin City, capturing a major staff officer. In the two engagements, over 20 enemies were killed or wounded, over 70 were captured alive, and over 60 rifles, six Mauser pistols, and two light machine guns were seized.

After four hours of fierce fighting, the entire enemy force was annihilated, 120 enemies were captured, 40 were killed, and one light machine gun, 30 rifles, and one Thompson submachine gun were seized. The Pingyin Brigade encircled Yaotou on May 2, completely annihilating the enemy, capturing 10 enemies, killing or wounding 3, and seizing 12 rifles and 458 rounds of ammunition. We only consumed 31 rounds of ammunition.

On May 15, the Pingyin Brigade ambushed Da Huaishu, west of the Jinpu Railway. At 6:00 a.m., the enemy Seventh District Township Team came to Da Huaishu to rob grain. We immediately launched a proactive attack and surrounded the enemy. After 40 minutes of fierce fighting, the enemy was annihilated, including the capture of pseudo-township chief Lu Waiyi, instructor Sun Jianyi, and 28 others. Eight enemies were killed or wounded, and one light machine gun, 20 rifles, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and 19,380,000 yuan in Chiang Kai-shek currency were seized.

That night, the Wenshang Home Return Corps went to Sunlou and captured six people. When the Home Return Corps left, they stepped on a landmine, and two enemies were wounded and died upon returning. Three of the captured people took the opportunity to escape.

[Jilu Yu, 28th Dispatch from this newspaper] News from the Henan General Branch: After the pseudo-Shandong Security Brigade's attempt to station in the Dong'a and Pingyin areas to loot wheat was thwarted, it fled to Pingyin in a hurry. However, under the continuous attacks of our First Military Sub-district's armed forces, the enemy was extremely panicked and urgently requested assistance from Jinan. Wang Yaowu, the bandit leader of the pseudo-Shandong Province, hurriedly sent over 60 vehicles and 9 tanks to Pingyin on the 22nd to bring the Security Brigade back to Changqing. Pingyin is now under our control again.

Another dispatch: On the 22nd, the Jiyang Brigade launched a surprise attack from 70 li away on the pseudo-township public office and police station in Nan Shicheng, Ningyang.

Twenty-two rifles, two short guns, 315 rounds of ammunition, and 450,000 yuan in legal currency were seized. We suffered no casualties. On the night of the 18th, our Third Sub-district Team of Yutai in the Third Military Sub-district crossed Nanyang Lake by boat and launched a strong attack on the Liugou stronghold, three li south of Nanyang Town, completely annihilating a squad of the defending enemy pseudo-lake police brigade, capturing 6 enemies, and seizing one light machine gun and five rifles.
