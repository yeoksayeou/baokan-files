Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 21st. The Trade Union of the No. 1 Clothing Factory of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Allied Defense Area has led the workers' movement in the factory for the past year, greatly improving labor attitudes, increasing production, protecting the factory's assets during the war, and leading workers to actively participate in the war. The trade union recognizes that ensuring the completion of the factory's production plan is the primary task of the trade union in a public factory. Whenever the factory proposes a new production plan, the trade union assists the factory in mobilizing workers, convening trade union group meetings, launching friendly competitions, and leveraging the enthusiasm and creativity of each worker. In this year's spring competition, production efficiency exceeded the original plan by an average of 20%. Each group holds meetings on schedule to review their production achievements and labor attitudes, and establish a Zhao Zhankui movement registration system throughout the factory, registering each worker's daily production achievements and ideological performance, and publishing them on the blackboard newspaper. After member Tian Dongyuan helped apprentice Shang Jinchang and was praised, it influenced many workers to improve their attitude towards apprentices. After Dang Wanhua reviewed his anger towards the factory, he also changed the attitude of other workers who did not respect the factory. The trade union also regularly holds technical exhibitions for everyone to comment and learn from. For example, after exhibiting Feng Binglu's finished products, it corrected the erroneous view of some workers that "quality cannot be improved if the task is to be completed," and completed the technical standards stipulated by the factory. When the bandits attacked last year, the trade union enhanced the workers' sense of ownership, led the workers to establish a workers' self-defense force to protect the factory. The workers disregarded their own safety and personal property, traveling back and forth on the eighty-mile mountain road day and night, rushing to transport the machines to a safe location. When the situation became tense again in August, the trade union led the workers to transfer all ×× thousands of pounds of materials to a safe area in one day and two nights, and continued to work. The workers' self-defense force fought more than forty large and small battles with the enemy, one of which resulted in the capture of twenty-eight enemy soldiers. The trade union also pays close attention to workers' mass discipline, frequently collects mass opinions, improves relations with resident villagers, expands the factory's good influence, and makes the masses willing to send their children to work in the factory.

　　The trade union pays great attention to workers' welfare, improves workers' lives, and strengthens workers' cultural and political education. The union has organized three workers' night schools and a workers' morning school, teaching in classes according to their level, and using a "little teacher" system to help female workers with children learn. Now, most workers can write simple letters and diaries and read the Mass Daily. The trade union also has a technical research committee, which is divided into various technical groups. Each worker is encouraged to participate in at least one group to study. The factory has cultivated a large number of local technical workers since 1943. The trade union also has a club, which organizes ball games, music, Yangko dance, and other activities. All workers in the mutual aid cooperative are shareholders, providing workers with daily necessities at low prices, and using dividends to comfort the sick. The funds are used as a workers' welfare fund. In addition, there is a school for workers' children, which reduces the difficulties of female workers and educates workers' children.
