　　Neiqiu flexibly issues loans
  　Middle and poor peasants jointly buy livestock
    [Neiqiu News] This county has issued 57.5 million yuan in spring plowing loans this year. The lending method has changed from the rigid past practice of restricting the use of loans. It is now proposed that as long as the loan is used for production, whatever is beneficial can be done. The masses welcomed this approach and, after receiving the loans, combined them with their private funds to engage in various production activities. Some bought livestock, some bought farm tools, some engaged in reproduction, and some did small business. The Second District has now added 451 farm tools, 2 carts, and 1 waterwheel. The First District has added 11 seeders, 90 plows, 20 harrows, and 2,034 other miscellaneous farm tools. Eight villages, including Nanyangzhai, have added 30 and a half head of livestock. The head of a middle peasant household in Caijiagou, Fifth District, led four poor peasant households, borrowed 85,000 yuan, and added 20,000 yuan of their own to buy a cow together. Poor farmhand Liang Xiaoping led three middle peasant households, borrowed 40,000 yuan, and also planned to buy a cow. The masses all said that this loan was very useful. In addition, in terms of production activities, Ren Zhuang Village in the Third District borrowed 350,000 yuan, lending 212,000 yuan to 11 poor farmhand households and 138,000 yuan to 21 middle peasant households. After receiving the loans, they freely combined to sell jujube noodles, earning more than 700,000 yuan in the past month. Several other households combined their private funds and raised 460,000 yuan to buy 10 head of livestock. (Neiqiu Office)
