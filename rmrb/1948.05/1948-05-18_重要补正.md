　　Important Correction
    In yesterday's "Voices of the Masses" column, seventh line, when Li was called but did not respond, Zhou Kuang immediately said to them, "It doesn't matter, you won't be held responsible if he dies." Should be corrected to: Zhou Kuang immediately said to them, "The person is about to be hanged to death." They said, "It doesn't matter, you won't be held responsible if he dies."
