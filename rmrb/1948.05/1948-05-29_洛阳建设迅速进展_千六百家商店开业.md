Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E, 26th: Luoyang City, which has been liberated again, is making rapid progress in various tasks under the Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's policy of "long-term construction of a new Luoyang." On the 9th of this month, Comrade Liu Youguang, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, pointed out in a summary report on the work of the past month at the city-wide cadre meeting that, due to the correct implementation of the Party Central Committee's urban policy, Luoyang City has gradually transformed from a dark, terrifying, and economically depressed dead city under the Chiang Kai-shek bandits into a new Luoyang with democracy, freedom, and upward development. According to statistics before May 8th, excluding vendors, the number of large and small shops that have opened in the city has reached more than 1,600, an increase of more than 400 compared to before liberation. The number of grain stores, salt stores, and homespun cloth stores that meet the needs of farmers has increased especially. Recently, two gold shops, two banks, and a large silk shop are preparing to resume business. Merchants who were deceived and fled to Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and other places have returned to Luoyang one after another. The Longmen Coal Mine, originally run by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Henan Construction Department, has increased its output after being taken over by the democratic government, ensuring the supply of coal in Luoyang. The destroyed power plant has started sending electricity on the 14th of last month thanks to the efforts of workers and technicians. In terms of culture and education, the United Middle School has been in session for half a month, and primary schools at all levels have also resumed classes one after another. The New Luoyang Daily has been published for more than a month, and the number of readers is increasing day by day. The People's Education Center has expanded from one reading room to three reading rooms for politics, literature and art, and current affairs in the past month, and the number of readers has increased from dozens to four or five hundred every day. The center also organized propaganda teams to draw maps of the counter-offensive situation of the People's Liberation Army, hold street lectures, and open-air music evenings to widely publicize the policies of the Communist Party of China and the democratic government and the situation of the revolutionary war, which has played a great educational role. Significant achievements have also been made in public security in the city. In recent months, several cases of bandits, drug trafficking, and abduction of young girls have been uncovered, as well as more than 20 cases of damage to public buildings, and social order is becoming more stable. In terms of political power, a new method of combining the masses and political power has been adopted, and the lower-level neighborhood political power has been transformed by democratic methods. These institutions have been used to complete household registration surveys and implement government orders, and the workers and poor people have been organized for production and self-rescue, thus establishing a new democratic order and laying the foundation for further construction of a new Luoyang. In summarizing the experience of urban work, Comrade Liu Youguang emphasized that protecting and developing industry and commerce is the central link in the current urban work. Comrade Liu Youguang concluded by saying that all work should start from long-term construction, and it is necessary to continue to implement the Party's industrial and commercial policies, further unite the people of Luoyang City, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek special organizations and the reactionary influence left by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime among the masses, establish the city's military police and people's armed forces, vigorously train local cadres, all cadres should carefully study urban policies, and learn specific implementation methods, carry forward the spirit of hard work, and strive to build a new Luoyang.

　　洛阳建设迅速进展
  　千六百家商店开业
    【新华社豫陕鄂二十六日电】重获解放的洛阳市在中共洛阳市委会“长期建设新洛阳”的方针下，各项工作进展甚速。本月九日市委书记刘有光同志，在全市干部大会上关于一个月来工作的总结报告中指出，由于正确执行党中央的城市政策，使洛市由蒋匪时代黑暗恐怖百业萧条的死城，逐渐成为民主自由向上发展的新洛阳。根据五月八日以前统计，除摊贩外，城市大小商店开业者已达一千六百余家，较解放前增加四百余家。适应农民需要的粮行、盐行、土布行增加尤多，最近并有两家金店、两家银行及一家大绸缎庄筹备复业。受骗逃往郑州、西安等地商人，已陆续返洛，原为蒋匪河南建设厅所办的龙门煤矿，由民主政府接收后，产量增加，保证了洛阳煤炭的供给。被毁的发电厂在工人与技师努力下，已于上月十四日开始送电。文教方面，联合中学已开课半月，各级小学亦纷纷复课。新洛阳报出版已月余，读者日增，民教馆一个月来由一个阅览室扩充为政治、文艺、时事三个阅览室，读者每天由数十人增至四、五百人。该馆并组织宣传队，绘制解放军反攻形势图，举行街头讲演，露天音乐晚会，普遍宣传中共与民主政府各项政策及革命战争形势，起了很大教育作用。市内治安工作亦获显著成绩，近月来曾先后破获土匪贩毒拐骗少女等案件数起，及破坏公共建筑物案件二十余起，社会秩序日趋安定。政权方面，采用了群众与政权结合的新方式，以民主方法改造了下层街闾政权，运用这些机构完成了户口调查与推行政令，并组织了工人贫民的生产自救，因而树立了新的民主秩序，并为进一步建设新洛阳打下了基础。在总结城市工作的经验中，刘有光同志着重指出保护与发展工商业，是目前城市工作的中心环节。刘有光同志的结语说，一切工作应从长期建设出发，必须继续贯彻党的工商业政策，进一步团结全洛市人民，肃清蒋特组织，及蒋伪政权遗留在群众中的反动影响，建立本市军警人民武装，大力培养本地干部，全体干部应细心学习城市政策，并且学会具体执行的办法，发挥艰苦作风，努力建设新洛阳。
