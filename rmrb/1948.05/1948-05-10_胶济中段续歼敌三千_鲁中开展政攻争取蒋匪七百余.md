Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 8th: 1. From April 27th to 29th, the People's Liberation Army annihilated over 1,500 fleeing enemy remnants south of Fangzi, capturing over 900 alive and killing over 500, including Chen Lifan, deputy commander of the Bandit Bao 10th Regiment. 2. On April 22nd, the People's Liberation Army captured Tianma Town, 15 li northeast of Changle, completely annihilating the 1,300+ enemy troops guarding it, capturing over 990 alive, and seizing 21 heavy machine guns, 3 small cannons, 794 long and short guns, and a radio station.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 8th: The Weifang Special City Government has decided to make providing relief to the disaster-stricken people suffering from Chiang bandit disasters as the current central task. It has already distributed 360,000 jin of relief grain for emergency relief. Each district is currently organizing post-disaster committees. The Xin Weifang newspaper is calling on disaster victims to use the government relief grain and low-interest loans from the Beihai Bank to engage in production.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: The Yishan Sub-district of Central Shandong, in coordination with the central Jiaoji campaign, launched a political offensive against the Chiang-puppet forces along the border of Chang (le) and An (qiu). By April 23rd, they had won over Chen Yougao and other Chiang-puppet armed forces, totaling over 700 men, who surrendered with over 70 rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei, 7th: Local armed forces in Eastern Hebei are actively protecting the masses in the border areas as they rush to plant crops. In the first, second, and fifth districts of Linyu, north of the Beining Railway, under the protection of our troops, the masses in the central areas voluntarily engaged in labor exchange and mutual assistance with the masses in the border areas to rush plant. County and district cadres and soldiers also actively participated, fighting when the enemy came and planting when the enemy left. The masses in the central area of Funing organized 812 teams of plowing oxen and helped the border areas plant most of the autumn fields within five days. The military and civilians of the county also combined spring plowing with a broad political offensive, publicizing the policies of the democratic government and calling on the masses who had left their homes due to intimidation and deception by the Chiang bandits to return and plant crops. Currently, over 500 households have returned to the second district. Xizhenzi Town in Luannan, 15th Sub-district, is only three to five li away from Fengrun City, a stronghold of the Chiang bandits. The masses, unable to bear the exploitation of the Chiang bandits, mostly fled to the liberated areas. Recently, under the protection of the local armed forces in the sub-district, the masses have been returning home to rush plant. Some villages in the central area have helped them with over 30 head of livestock. The masses are all producing with large guns on their backs. The escorting troops repelled two enemy disturbances. The masses rushed to plant over 9,000 mu of sorghum and millet in two days. The female deputy director of the Women's Agricultural Association in Fengzhuang Village, Leting, south of the railway, led women in plowing and sowing. The village completed planting its land in three days. (Attached picture)
