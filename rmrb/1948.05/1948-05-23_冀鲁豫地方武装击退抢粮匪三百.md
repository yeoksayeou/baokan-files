　　[This dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 21st] The explosives team of our First Military Subdistrict's Armed Forces Department, in coordination with the Working Team of the Second District of Feicheng, ambushed bandits in the southern mountains of Shiwu in the Second District of Feicheng on the morning of April 14th. After breakfast, more than 300 Chiang bandits who were robbing grain entered our firing range. We immediately fired fiercely with volley guns, and our landmines exploded simultaneously. After 40 minutes of fierce fighting, the enemy fled in disarray. In this battle, seven enemies, including a company commander and lower ranks, were killed or wounded. We suffered no casualties. After the battle, the masses spread the word: "The landmines blossomed, scaring the returning legions to scream for their mothers!"
