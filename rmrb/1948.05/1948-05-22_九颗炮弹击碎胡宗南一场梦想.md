　　Nine Shells Shatter Hu Zongnan's Dream
　　Chang Deng
　　After the bandit Hu Zongnan had five entire brigades, more than 30,000 men, annihilated by our Northwest Field Army in Yichuan, Shaanxi, in early March, he felt an even greater shortage of troops and could not cope with the situation. He had no choice but to rob Peter to pay Paul, and wanted to airlift the 30th Brigade, which was isolated in Linfen, back to Xi'an. In this way, on the one hand, the 30th Brigade could be rescued from the doomed city of Linfen to avoid being wiped out by the People's Liberation Army; on the other hand, it could increase his garrison force in Xi'an. This was truly a win-win wishful thinking. Therefore, on March 6th, the bandit Hu sent three planes to Linfen, and airlifted about a battalion of the 30th Brigade. On the 7th, ten planes came at once, wanting to gradually transport the entire 30th Brigade away.
　　However, the bandit Hu's wishful thinking quickly turned into a bubble. A unit of our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Jinan Front Field Army—Unit 209—arrived at Qilicun, the southeast corner of the Linfen Airport, at 7:30 a.m. on the 7th after a night of intense marching on the 6th. Regardless of their fatigue, they immediately concentrated their artillery fire to bombard the airport fiercely. With just nine shells, they destroyed two enemy planes: one was hit and caught fire, immediately emitting thick smoke, and could no longer move. One was hit in the head, damaging the engine, and struggled to fly into the air, then landed weakly. The remaining eight enemy planes, upon hearing the fierce bombardment by our army, hurriedly took off and fled. From then on, Hu Zongnan's plan to airlift the 30th Brigade back to Xi'an was completely shattered. The 30th Brigade's fate was finally sealed to be annihilated in Linfen.
　　At dawn on the 9th, the strongholds around Linfen Airport, such as Yaozhangsu, Qiaojiazhuang, Kangjiazhuang, Chaicun, Ducun, Zhongcun, etc., were successively captured by our army, and the airport was completely controlled by our army. In other words, the air escape route of the Chiang-Yan bandit army, isolated in the doomed city of Linfen, was completely cut off by our army.
　　On the morning of the 10th, the reporter personally went to the airport and saw the remains of the two planes that were destroyed on the spot. One had its head blown off, and the other had its belly destroyed, both lying coldly on the runway. Their tragic fate symbolizes the inevitable fate of the Chiang-Hu bandit army that is about to be annihilated.

　　九颗炮弹击碎胡宗南一场梦想
    常登
    胡匪宗南三月初在陕西宜川被我西北野战军歼灭五个整旅、三万多人以后，越发感到兵力不足，无法招架，只好拆东墙来补西墙。想把他孤守在临汾城的三十旅空运回西安。这样，一方面可以把三十旅从临汾死城抢救出去，免得被人民解放军歼灭；另一方面可以增加他在西安的守备力量。这真是一举两得的如意算盘。因此，胡匪于三月六日派了三架飞机到临汾，把三十旅空运走了约一个营的兵力。七号一次就来了飞机十架，想陆续把三十旅完全运走。
    但是，胡匪的如意算盘很快就化成了泡影。我晋冀鲁豫军区晋南前线野战军一部——二○九部队，六日晚上经过一夜的强烈行军，七日上午七时半赶到了临汾飞机场东南角的七里村。他们不顾疲劳，马上集中炮火向飞机场猛烈轰击。仅仅打了九发炮弹，就击毁敌机两架：一架被击中起火，马上冒出浓烟，再也不能动弹了。一架被击中头部，把引擎打坏了，挣扎着飞上半空，就有气无力地降落下来。其余敌机八架，一听到我军炮火猛击，就慌忙起飞逃跑了。从此，胡宗南想空运三十旅回西安的计划完全被粉碎了。卅旅的命运最后注定要被歼灭在临汾了。
    九号拂晓，临汾飞机场周围的尧帐宿、乔家庄、亢家庄、柴村、杜村、仲村等据点先后被我军攻克，飞机场就被我军完全掌握了。也就是说，孤守临汾死城的蒋阎匪军的空中逃跑，被我军完全切断了。
    十号上午，记者亲至飞机场，见那两架就地击毁的飞机遗骸，一架被打掉了脑袋，一架被击毁了肚子，都冷清清地躺在跑道上。它们这种悲惨的命运，正象征着蒋胡匪军即将到来的不能逃脱的被歼灭的命运。
