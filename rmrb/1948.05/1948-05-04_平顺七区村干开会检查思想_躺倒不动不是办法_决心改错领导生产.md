[Pingshun News] At the enlarged cadre meeting of the entire district in the seventh district on April 16, it was discovered that the village cadres did not understand the significance of the Party rectification democratic movement, and there were many problems in their thinking. (1) Generally, cadres resisted democracy, complained about the poor and hired peasants, and pushed everything onto the poor and hired peasants. They didn't care about anything themselves and said that the poor and hired peasants didn't want them anymore. Many cadres said, "After the Land Law Outline came down, whenever any work was done, the poor and hired peasants always disagreed with the cadres. People didn't tell us when they had meetings, and we couldn't participate even if we wanted to. Even if we saw something was wrong, we didn't dare to say anything, fearing people would say we still wanted to oppress them." Some were rumored to be saying, "When filling out the forms during village Party rectification, they would find fault even if there was no fault." They didn't dare to work, and even writing a road permit had to go through the poor and hired peasants. Among them, some wanted to be good old men, thinking that this was the way out. When there were many people at meetings, there were many; when there were few, there were few. Some would work if someone urged them, and wouldn't if no one urged them. Some, after being educated by district cadres, started to work, but it was not consciously, but because they were afraid after hearing the reports that lying down and doing nothing was a mistake on top of a mistake. The political director of Heihe Village only started to work after reading in the newspaper that "cadres who forget the masses will not end well." But it was also different from the past, it was an attitude of doing the job just to get by. (2) The old village cadres thought that "loyal and good people have no good ending," and the longer they held office, the bigger their mistakes. They felt that the Party and the higher authorities had let them down, and the masses now looked down on them, and they had no power. (3) Cadres with middle peasant or higher backgrounds were even more afraid. Qin Yuan, the director of the cooperative in Data Village, was a middle peasant. Hearing that the poor and hired peasants were in power, he felt that middle peasants could not get ahead. The poor and hired peasants said at the meeting, "Cadres in other villages have been replaced by poor and hired peasants, but our village hasn't changed, and there are still middle peasants as cadres." He was even more afraid, "It'll be our turn soon, now we're not even as good as a landlord! Landlords get to sing, but we're worried." He didn't do anything every day, and he didn't dare to ask for the cooperative's external debts, fearing that the masses would say that he was not taking care of the difficulties. He felt that he had not done enough good things for the masses, so he wanted to put his own cattle in the cooperative to make up for the shortfall and never do it again. He came to the district meeting mainly to hand over power and resign. "Otherwise, just detain me in the district and I won't go back."

After the leadership's enlightenment and guidance, everyone discussed and deliberated in small and large groups. Some people began to realize: "We only say that the poor and hired peasants don't want us, but we haven't thought about how we treat them." Some said: "In the past, no one dared to point out our mistakes, and the more mistakes we made; today, someone points them out, and we can correct them immediately, isn't that good?" Some said: "The poor and hired peasants and the masses are also telling the truth. As long as we admit and correct our mistakes, and discuss things with everyone, and don't use the old methods of the past, the masses will also see the good and bad." Some said: "The more people in power, the better. Three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang. That is, when doing things, we are not subjective and do not give orders, and there will be no mistakes if we have democratic discussions." Some still emphasized that the poor and hired peasants have a retaliatory mentality and feel that there is no way out; or they don't dare to approach the masses, fearing that people will say that they want to buy people's hearts, ... etc., but they are not the majority. Regarding future problems, everyone also discussed it. On the one hand, they felt that continuing to work in the past with a commanding style would be like an old man carrying his daughter-in-law across the river, putting in effort but not being appreciated, but on the other hand, it was not right to want to be a good person and find a way out. Finally, it was affirmed that the best way is to be determined to correct mistakes, patiently solve the difficulties of the masses, and handle things through democratic discussion. This is the way to pave the way for oneself, and the masses will be satisfied. Even if there are mistakes in the past, the masses will help us correct them. In this way, merits and demerits will be offset, and the problem will naturally be solved slowly. So, they immediately made a spring plowing plan and decided to lead the masses to produce well.

### 平顺七区村干开会检查思想　躺倒不动不是办法  决心改错领导生产

　　平顺七区村干开会检查思想
  　躺倒不动不是办法  决心改错领导生产
    【平顺消息】七区在四月十六日召开的全区扩大干部会议上，发现各村干部对整党民主运动的意义不了解，思想上存在着许多问题。（一）一般干部是抵抗民主，埋怨贫雇，把一切事情往贫雇身上推。自己什么也不管，又说是贫雇不要自己了。好多干部都是说：“土地法大纲下来后，凡是搞个啥工作，贫雇总是和干部合不来，人家开会也不给咱说，说也不能参加，就是看见有些不对也不敢吭声，怕人家说咱还想压人哩。”有的传说着：“填补村整党时，没错的还给找个错。”工作不敢干，写个路条也通过贫雇。其中也有一些人想当个老好人，认为这就是出路。开会时人多就多，少就少，有人催我就干，没人催我就算。也有些经过区干部教育，工作干开了，但不是自觉的，而是听了报上说的躺倒不干是错上加错，有点害怕。黑虎村政治主任是看了报上说的“干部忘了群众没落上好结果”才干开。但也和过去不同，是当一天和尚撞一天钟的应付态度。（二）老村干的思想是“保国忠良无下场”，担任工作越长的错误越大。觉得党和上级对不起他们，群众现在也看不起他们，自己无权了。（三）中农以上成份的干部更害怕。达驮村合作社社长秦元则是中农，听说贫雇掌权，觉着中农吃不开了。贫雇开会说：“其他村干部都换成贫雇了，咱村没动，还有中农当干部。”自己更害怕，“快轮到咱头上了，现在咱还不如个地主哩！人家地主是唱，咱是发愁。”每天什么也不干，合作社的外欠也不敢去要，怕群众说不照顾困难，觉着自己没给群众办下多少好事，就想把自己的牛贴在合作社里，补起这个亏空，再也不干了。来区开会，主要是想交权辞职。“要不就扣我在区上，不回去了。”
    经过领导上启发诱导，大家小组大组讨论酝酿，有些人开始觉悟：“咱光是说人家贫雇不要咱，就没有想想咱对待人家怎样。”有的说：“过去咱有错没人敢提，错误越犯越多；今天有人提，有了错马上就能给咱改了，这还不好？”有的说：“贫雇和群众也是说真理哩。只要咱认错改错，有事和大家商量着办，不要用过去的旧作法，群众也会看出好坏来。”有的说：“越是掌权的多了才越好办，三个臭皮匠，能顶个诸葛亮，就是办事情不主观，不命令，有事民主讨论就出不了错。”也有人仍强调贫雇是报复思想，觉得没出路；或是想接近群众也不敢，怕人家说自己想收买人哩，……等等，但不占多数。关于今后的问题，大家也讨论了一下。一方面觉得照以前的命令主义作风干下去，是老翁背儿媳妇过河，出力不讨好，但另一方面，想当好人找出路也不对。最后肯定，最好的办法是决心改错，耐心解决群众困难，有事民主讨论来办。这样才是给自己修路，群众才会满意。过去就是有错，群众也会帮咱改正。这样功过相抵，问题自然就慢慢解决了。于是当场订出春耕计划，决心领导群众好好生产。
