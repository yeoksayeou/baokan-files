[Lingchuan News] During the spring plowing last year in Chengdong Village, Fucheng District, the masses were unwilling to cooperate with the retired soldiers because they were poor laborers and difficult to negotiate with, and the masses were afraid of suffering losses. This year, when they were called upon to voluntarily form mutual aid teams for spring plowing, seven retired soldiers, hearing these reactions, voluntarily formed a mutual aid team. They spent all day digging field edges and weeding stubble. A farmer named Debao, seeing their enthusiasm for mutual aid, wanted to join this group. The group leader, Zhang Changrou (a retired soldier), said, "If you want to come, then come!" They held a meeting and discussed that all the land of these families should be cultivated, with no changes in wages. There was a Zhang Baofa in the group who went out when it was time to work in the fields. The other six families plowed the edges and stubble of his field. Influenced by this, four more families of ordinary people joined the group. They organized their lives in the fields well, finished planting the millet, and earned six sheng of rice by bartering labor with two others. They also helped poor peasant Li Fachang plant 2.5 mu of millet, carry 40 loads of manure, and hoe one mu of wheat for Zhang Leiming. The lazy man Yuan Sanbao didn't want to move all day long, but this time during the spring plowing he went down the mountain, and the group did all the work in his fields for him. When he came back from the mountain and saw that everyone had done his fields, he felt sorry for them and later joined the mutual aid group. Their group has four full laborers, two half laborers, and four women, cultivating more than 70 mu of millet. There are also 60 mu of corn, and the group discussed guaranteeing the completion of sowing within six days.

　　荣退军人互助种地把懒汉也带起来了
    【陵川消息】附城区城东村在去年春耕时，群众都不愿给荣退军人互助，因为他们劳力差池，不好商量，群众怕吃亏。今年号召春耕自愿结合互助组，荣退军人听到这些反映，有七个人就自动互助起来。整天刨地边、＠茬。农民德保看见他们互助很有劲，一心想参加这一组，组长张昌肉（荣退军人）说：“你来你就来吧！”他们开了个会，讨论这几家的地都要种完，不变工资。组里有个张保法，到上地时他就去外头了。这六家就把他的地边谷茬都刨完。在这个影响下，随后就有四家老百姓参加了这个组。他们把地里的生活都整理好，种完谷，又给别人变工两个，赚米六升。并帮助贫农李法昌种谷二亩半，担粪四十担，给张垒明锄麦一亩。懒汉原三保整天不想动弹，这次春耕种地他下山去了，组里就把他地里的活给他做完。他从山下回来，看见大家把他的地都做好了，自己感觉对不起人家，后来也跟着互助组干起来。他们的组共有全劳力四人，半劳力二人，妇女四人，种谷七十多亩。还有六十亩玉茭，组里讨论在六天内保证完成下种。
