　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 29th: Over 100,000 laborers in the Lüliang District have completed the transportation of 60,000 large shi (each shi being 300 jin) of grain, which was to provide relief for the disaster-stricken people of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, in one month from mid-February to mid-March. To accomplish this huge grain transportation task, the Northwest Disaster Relief Committee specifically established a grain transportation headquarters in the Lüliang District. It also transferred over 500 cadres from the Lüliang District and other areas to establish grain transportation stations along the route. The heads of the Party, government, and military in the Third, Ninth, and Tenth Sub-districts also organized grain transportation committees, widely mobilizing the masses. Under the call of "Farmers all over the world are one family," peasants from various places flocked to the grain transportation front in droves. In the Ninth Sub-district alone, over 7,000 laborers were mobilized successively from six counties including Lingshi, Fenxi, Xixian, and Shilou. On the thousand-li-long transportation line, they moved westward, regardless of the constant harassment by the Chiang-Yan bandit troops and American-made Chiang planes. The masses along the way provided firewood and grass, and women made a rush to sew grain sacks. Women in Hongdong and Zhaocheng sewed 100,000 grain sacks, and over 300 women from eight villages around a certain grain station sewed over 60,000 grain sacks. Laborers transporting grain in Shuitou Town, Xixian County, crossed mountain roads where snow was knee-deep. Many people lost their shoes or had their legs frostbitten, but they still worked day and night without rest. Laborers in Lingshi County even donated 6,893 jin of grain, which they had saved from their own rations in two days, to provide relief for the disaster victims. Many laborers in the Tenth Sub-district gave their own dry rations to the grain station to be transferred to the disaster victims in northern Shaanxi. In the First District of Xixian County, laborers carrying four bags of grain each (each bag weighing 25 to 30 jin) accounted for three-quarters of the total number of people.

    【新华社晋绥二十九日电】吕梁区十余万民工，从二月中旬到三月中旬一月内，已将晋冀鲁豫救济陕甘宁灾民之六万大石（每石三百斤）粮食运送完毕。为完成此项巨大运粮任务，西北救灾委员会特于吕梁区设立运粮总站。并从吕梁区等地抽调五百余干部，在沿线建立运粮小站，三、九、十分区党政军负责人亦组织运粮委员会，广泛动员群众，各地农民则在“天下农民一家人”的号召下，成群结队，拥入运粮战线。仅九分区之灵石、汾西、隰县、石楼等六县先后动员民工达七千余个。在长达千里的运输线上，不顾蒋阎匪军及美造蒋机的不断骚扰，向西进行。沿途群众供给柴草，妇女突击缝粮袋，洪（洞）赵（城）妇女即缝粮袋十万个，某粮站周围八个村妇女三百余人，共缝粮袋六万余个。隰县水头镇运粮民工翻过积雪没膝的山路，许多人丢了鞋或冻伤了腿，仍日夜不息。灵石县民工并将自己两天中节约的口粮，六八九三斤，捐出救济灾民。十分区不少民工将自己的干粮交给粮站转给陕北灾民。隰县一区民工每人担粮四包（每包二十五斤至三十斤）者，占总人数四分之三。
