Taiyue News: The Yicheng Second District held a meeting in early May to inspect spring plowing. The inspection revealed that cadres in ten natural villages, including Tianjiahe, did not organize mutual aid based on the voluntary participation and needs of the masses when deploying work. Instead, they simply forced groups to be formed for the sake of "competition and challenges" and "currying favor with superiors," greatly affecting the production enthusiasm of the masses. For example, Wang Xiuying, a female labor hero from Tianjiahe, said at a meeting with women, "I challenged others at the league meeting. Women must form groups to carry manure. Anyone who doesn't participate is a local ruffian." Qingcheng Village stipulated three punishment methods for those unwilling to participate in mutual aid: (1) Latecomers will have glasses drawn on their faces. (2) Those who don't go will be made to wear paper hats and paraded through the streets. (3) Those who don't participate in mutual aid will be fined manure. Wang Bingjun, a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee, said, "If we don't force them, they won't volunteer. How can we get the work done?" After Liu Zuozhong, director of the Military Affairs Committee of Shibo Village, formed groups, he did not solve the problem of recording work points and converting labor for everyone, only saying, "Form the groups and start working first, just don't let any land lie fallow. We'll talk about the system later." Ma Yuande, a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee of Xiashimen, said when organizing mutual aid, "Women can volunteer if they have the conditions, but they can't volunteer if they don't have the conditions. If they don't go, they are just naughty, bad wives." It was precisely because of the cadres' confused understanding and the lack of clear guidance from the leadership on what should and should not be done that a serious phenomenon of forced group formation that was divorced from the masses was created. In Tianjiahe, Wang Lanying, a woman with bound feet, was forced to carry manure, which led to her suicide. Xu Xiuying and Wang Xiuying, women from Qingcheng Village, both miscarried due to being forced to carry too much manure. In Youzhuang, a woman was afraid of being grouped and hid for two or three days. In Beigang Village, a woman miscarried a boy because of this. In Shibo Village, a middle peasant was afraid of suffering losses because the mutual aid didn't stipulate methods for recording work points and repaying labor, so he refused to feed his cattle and insisted on selling them. In addition, some cadres in various villages did not personally work alongside the masses, which made the masses even more dissatisfied. For example, a certain member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee in Shimen Village had a very bureaucratic attitude, not going to the fields to work, but just sitting in the Farmers' Association and receiving reports from the group leaders. On the 26th of last month, when women were carrying manure in Zhaojiaqiao, village chief Zhai Xingye only recorded the accounts on the side, and the village instructor stood there supervising the work. A member of a mutual aid group in Shangwu Village said, "What is called volunteering? When the group leader calls, can we hide our faces in the ground!" The masses had a lot of knots in their thinking. After everyone discussed, they realized the seriousness of the problem. Comrade Wang Yi, the secretary of the sub-committee, concluded, "Forced orders and simple group formation have created chaos in the villages. This has become an important deviation in today's production leadership. In the future, we must strengthen leadership, and the base-point cadres must specifically help the village cadres, improve the system, and transform it."

### 强制群众挑战竞赛　翼城二区互助出毛病

　　强制群众挑战竞赛
  　翼城二区互助出毛病
    【太岳消息】翼城二区五月初开会检查春耕，检查中发现田家河等十个自然村的干部，在布置工作时，就没根据群众自愿与需要去组织互助，只是单纯的为了“竞赛挑战”“向上讨好”去强迫编组，大大影响了群众生产情绪。如田家河女劳动英雄王秀英和妇女们开会时说：“我在联上开会跟人家挑战啦，妇女要编组担粪，谁不参加就是地痞流氓。”青城村对不愿互助的人规定了三条处罚的办法：（一）去的迟了划眼镜。（二）不去的戴纸帽子游街。（三）不参加互助的罚粪。农会常委王秉俊说：“不强迫都不自愿，工作还搞不搞？”史伯村武委会主任刘作忠编起组以后，不给大家解决记工折工的问题，只说：“编起来先干着，不荒一亩地就行，什么制度以后再说。”下石门农会常委马元德，组织互助时说：“妇女有条件可以自愿，无条件可不能由她自愿，不去就是跳皮捣蛋的坏老婆。”正因为各村干部思想认识上的糊涂，领导上又没明确指出应该怎样干不应该怎样干，所以造成了强迫编组脱离群众的严重现象。田家河因硬逼小脚妇女王兰英去担粪，结果逼得她自杀了。青城村妇女许秀英、王秀英，都因强迫担粪过重小产了。油庄有个妇女怕编组，躲藏起来两三天人都找不见。北橄村有个妇女因此小产了一个男孩。史伯村中农因互助没规定记工还工的办法，他怕吃亏牛也不喂了，嚷着非卖不行。再加各村有些干部不亲自下手和群众一起劳动，群众就更加不满。如石门村某农会常委，官僚架子很大，不下地劳动，只是坐在农会接受小组长的汇报。翟家桥上月二十六妇女担粪时，村长翟兴业只在一旁记帐，村指导员是站在那里监工。上吴村一个互助组员说：“什么叫自愿？组长来唤还能把脸藏到地下！”群众在思想上结着很大的疙瘩。大家经过讨论，认识了问题的严重。分委书记王毅同志总结时说：“强迫命令简单编组闹的村里乱七八糟，这已成今天生产领导上的重要偏向，今后要加强领导，各基点干部要具体帮助村干部，健全制度，加以改造。”
