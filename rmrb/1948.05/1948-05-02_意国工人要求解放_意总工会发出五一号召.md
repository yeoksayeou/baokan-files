Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Rome Dispatch: The Executive Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labour recently issued a letter to the Italian working people, calling on them "to express their will for liberation and improved living standards on May Day, and to strengthen the unity of the working people." The letter emphasized that the living standards of Italian workers remain low, and the number of unemployed nationwide has reached two million. It warned that prominent industrialists are planning to lay off workers on a large scale and revise the wage system proportional to prices, further reducing workers' living standards. Therefore, the Executive Committee called on the working people to unite more closely in order to counter this suppression and win victory. The letter urged the working people to rise up and demand the implementation of agricultural reforms to abolish large estates, the nationalization of major industries, workers' participation in the management of industrial enterprises, the fulfillment of public works and reclamation plans, the construction of houses for workers, the provision of jobs for the unemployed, and the demand that Italy follow a policy of peace and not participate in any military blocs.

　　意国工人要求解放
  　意总工会发出五一号召
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】罗马讯：意总工会执委会日前发表告意大利劳动人民书，号召他们“在五一节表示要求解放和提高生活水准的意志，并加强劳动人民的团结。”该书着重指出意工人生活水准依然低下，全国失业人数已达二百万。并警告说：显要的工业家正计划大规模开除工人，修改以物价为比例的工资制，使工人生活水准更加降低。因此执委会号召劳动人民更加团结，以便反击这一镇压而赢得胜利。该书敦促劳动人民奋起要求实行取消大地产的农业改革，主要工业国有化、工人参加工业企业的管理、履行公共工程与开垦计划、为工人建筑房屋、给失业者以工作，以及要求意大利遵循和平政策，不参加任何军事集团。
