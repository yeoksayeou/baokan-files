　　Actively Serve the People and Transform Oneself
  　Anyang Village Cadres Take the Initiative to Lead Production
    [Ping Shun News] Since the cadres and party members of Anyang Village in the Seventh District of Ping Shun understood that the Party rectification and democratic movement was to transform the cadres and party members, so that everyone could serve the people well, they tried every means to find things that were beneficial to the masses based on the village's situation. In drought years, the villagers had great difficulty getting drinking water, and they had to travel sixteen *li* to get a load of water. The village cadres mobilized and organized the villagers to dig wells. By the middle of March, two wells, three *zhang* deep, had been dug and filled with water, enough for the whole village to drink for two months. Fearing that it would not be enough, they organized the villagers to first drink the distant water outside the village, and then drink the near water in the village when there was no other way. In January and February, there was heavy snow, and they organized the villagers to collect a pond of snow in eight early mornings, which melted into more than half a pond of water, enough to drink for more than two months. Now, as the masses drink the pond water, the elderly say with emotion, "I have lived such a long life, and I have never seen pond water being drunk in the spring; it used to be finished before the first month." Some said, "If it weren't for the cadres pushing so hard, could we still be drinking the water from the open pond now?" Anyang Village has high mountains and cold weather, with thick rocks and thin soil, and not much grain is harvested, making life difficult. Because *dangshen* (Codonopsis pilosula) is profitable, the villagers are willing to plant it, but they all lack seedlings. Buying some seedlings in the village can't solve the big problem. When the villagers had no way, the village cadres went to other villages to inquire and buy seedlings, and called on everyone to speed up preparations for planting, guaranteeing that "as long as you are willing to plant, the cadres are responsible for the seedlings." For those who really can't afford the money, the cooperative will temporarily advance a portion. The cadres did not want any remuneration, and after running around in other villages for more than ten days, they finally bought back more than 700 *jin* of seedlings, which were completely sold to the masses. The masses said, "This is a big deal! If it weren't for the cadres, we couldn't buy it even if we had money." Wang Maijiang, a villager who returned from working in She County, thought he had missed out because the masses had already bought the seedlings, and he was very discouraged. Who knew that the cadres had not forgotten him and had saved several *jin* for him. He said happily, "It couldn't be better." The masses in the nearby Menlou Village were also very envious and said, "Our village has money but can't buy *dangshen* seedlings. The Anyang cadres are really serving the masses!" In addition, the Anyang village cadres also led the masses in transportation, earning 436,000 yuan, and planted nearly 2,000 trees. The masses now support the village cadres very much. The village has now undergone detailed discussions by the masses and has formulated a spring plowing and sowing plan to complete the planting of 400 *mu* of millet and 500 *mu* of corn by the end of the third lunar month. Plowing began on the 16th. (Huai Jia, Jia Ji, Tian Feng)

　　积极服务人民改造自己
  　安阳村干主动领导生产
    【平顺消息】平顺七区安阳村干部党员自从明白了整党民主运动就是要改造干部党员，使大家好好为人民服务以后，即根据本村情况，想尽方法，到处寻找对群众有利的事情来做。该村群众一到旱年，吃水非常困难，一担水要来回跑十六里路才能弄到，村干部就动员组织群众来打井。到三月中，已打成三丈深的两眼井，放满水，可够全村两个月吃。因怕不够吃，就组织群众先吃村外远水，没法时再吃村中近水。正、二月下了大雪，又组织群众用八个清早收了一池雪，消了多半池水，也能吃两个多月。现在群众吃着池水，老年人就感慨的说：“咱活了这么大年纪，还没见过春天吃池水，都是不过正月就吃完啦。”有的说：“要不是干部追的紧，咱现在还能吃开池里水？”安阳村山高天寒，石厚土簿，收粮不多，生活困难。因党参利大，群众都愿意种党参，但都缺少参秧。只在本村买点秧，也解决不了大问题。群众没办法，村干部就专门跑到外村去到处打听，收买参秧，并号召大家加紧准备种。保证“只要愿种，秧子干部负责。”真正出不起钱的，合作社暂垫一部。干部们不要报酬，在外村跑了十几天，终于买回七百多斤秧，完全分卖与群众。群众说：“这可顶了大事啦！要不是干部，咱有钱也买不到。”村民王买江在涉县做工回来，群众都买过了，他以为自己误了，很泄气，谁知干部并没有忘了他，还给他保存了好几斤。他高兴的说：“再好也不能啦。”安阳附近的门楼村群众也非常羡慕的说：“咱村有钱买不到参秧，人家安阳干部真是为群众服务哩！”此外，安阳村干还领导群众运输，赚洋四十三万六千元，植树近二千棵。群众现在对村干部都非常拥护。该村现已经过群众详细讨论，订出春耕下种计划，要在阴历三月底种完四百亩谷、五百亩玉茭。十六日就开耧了。（怀家、家吉、田丰）
