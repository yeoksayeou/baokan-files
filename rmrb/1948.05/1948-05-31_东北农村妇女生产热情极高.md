Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th. In the Northeast Liberated Areas, rural women who have obtained land are actively participating in production. The old societal view that "marrying a man means marrying for food and clothing" is gradually being broken down after two years of land reform. In Manxing and Wuhua villages in Bin County, Songjiang Province, over 45% of women are participating in production, an increase of 20% compared to last year. In Du'erbert Banner and Xintun Talaha districts in Nenjiang Province, 50% of women are participating in agricultural and sideline production. During the spring plowing season, most women participated in light labor such as delivering manure and digging up stubble. In Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, 7,245 women were organized to push carts and deliver manure. In Chaoyang Village, Jining County, Mudanjiang Province, all able-bodied young women, in addition to collecting 70,000-80,000 bundles of firewood, also dug up stubble on 200 hectares of land, allowing the male labor force in the village to free up time to open over 100 hectares of wasteland. In Xiajiatun Village, Gaiping County, Liaonan Province, 600 women chopped 4.5 million catties of firewood in one month, and also urged the landlord and wealthy peasant women to participate in chopping 15,000 catties of firewood. Women's participation in sideline production is even more widespread. In Miao Zhiquan District, Anguang County, Nenjiang Province, 1,743 women collected over 3,000 carts of manure and boiled over 173,000 catties of salt. Women in the eighth district of Zhaodong exchanged over one million catties of grain straw with income from sideline production. Provinces such as Liaobei and Mudanjiang are convening provincial women's committees to discuss mobilizing women to participate in production in order to fully develop production and support the war. The Heilongjiang Provincial Women's Committee conducted a summary of rural women's production in the province and pointed out that if 20% to 30% of the province's total population could be mobilized, at least 200,000 to 300,000 women could be put into agricultural labor, which would become an undeniable force in the task of increasing grain production by one million shi throughout the province.

　　东北农村妇女生产热情极高
    【新华社东北二十八日电】东北解放区得到了土地的的广大农村妇女，正在积极参加生产，旧社会对于妇女所流传的“嫁汉嫁汉穿衣吃饭”的看法，经过两年来土改运动，已逐渐打破。松江省宾县满幸、物华等村参加生产的妇女达百分之四十五以上，较去年增加百分之二十。嫩江省杜尔伯特旗、新屯他拉哈两区，已有百分之五十的妇女参加农业及副业生产。在春耕中，妇女大部分参加了送粪，刨谷槎等轻劳动。黑龙江拜泉全县组织了七千二百四十五名妇女，推车送粪。牡丹江鸡宁县朝阳村全部青壮妇女除打柴七八万捆外，还刨二百垧地的槎子，使该村男劳动力得抽出工夫开了百余垧荒地。辽南盖平县下家屯村六百名妇女在一月中砍柴四百五十万斤，并督促地主富农妇女参加打柴一万五千斤。妇女参加副业生产的，更为普遍。嫩江安广县苗治全区一千七百四十三名，妇女拾粪三千余车，熬盐十七万三千余斤，肇东八区妇女以副业生产所得换回谷草百余万斤。辽北牡丹江等省为全力发展生产支援战争，都在召开省妇委会，讨论发动妇女参加生产问题。黑龙江省妇委会就该省农村妇女生产进行总结指出按该省全部人口计，如能动员百分之二十至三十以上的妇女，则最低可有二十至三十万妇女投入农业劳动，在配合全省增粮百万石的任务中，将成为不可忽视的力量。
