　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: New York dispatch: American public opinion continues to criticize Truman and Marshall's statement on US-Soviet relations. The National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association issued a statement to the press on the 14th, severely condemning Truman's denial that Smith had extended peace feelers to the Soviet Union. The committee pointed out that the American people and all the people of Europe hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will negotiate to resolve differences, but Truman has no intention of seeking peace and demands that the Soviet Union yield to the American position. The New York Post editorial criticized the Truman administration for rejecting the Soviet Union's desire to discuss US-Soviet differences, betraying the American people's hope for peace. It also said that Truman attempted to "deceive world public opinion with utterly stupid nonsense, saying that American policy has no hostility, and there is no need to hold peace talks." Chicago Sun-Times observer Reynolds said that Truman and Marshall's statement indicated that they would continue to fight a "cold war." Truman believed that the US-Soviet exchange of views was a "defeat." He speculated that the United States would continue to pursue a policy of force. Even conservative newspapers, out of fear of the strong will of the people demanding peace and for other purposes, such as the New York Herald Tribune, also wrote articles calling on the United States to open up avenues for resolving the Soviet problem, and not to continue to pursue policies that strengthen the Western European bloc and the American armed forces. The article said: People all over the world are deeply disappointed because the faint light that was ignited after the exchange of notes between the United States and the Soviet Union is disappearing, and they believe that it is the United States' fault that it poured cold water on this fire.

　　美政府拒绝苏美谈判
  　违背了美国人民意志
    美舆论严斥杜鲁门马歇尔声明
    【新华社陕北十九日电】纽约讯：美舆论继续斥责杜鲁门、马歇尔对美苏关系的声明。美苏友好协会全国委员会十四日向报界发表声明，严责杜鲁门否认史密斯曾向苏联伸展和平触角的态度。该委员会指出：美国人民和全体欧洲人民都希望美苏谈判以解决分歧，但杜鲁门无意谋和平，并要求苏联迁就美国的立场。纽约邮报社论批评杜鲁门政府拒绝苏联讨论苏美分歧的愿望，背弃了美国人民争取和平的希望。并说：杜鲁门企图“以愚蠢透顶的无稽之谈欺骗世界舆论，说什么美国政策既无敌意，就没有举行和平会谈的必要”。芝加哥太阳报观察家雷诺说，杜鲁门和马歇尔的声明表示还要打“冷仗”，杜鲁门认为美苏交换意见是打了一次“败仗”。他推测：美国将继续奉行武力政策。甚至保守的报纸因慑于人民要求和平的强烈意志及其他目的，如纽约先驱论坛报也著论呼吁美国打开解决对苏问题的途径，不要继续奉行加强西欧集团和美国武装部队的政策。该文说：全世界人民深深失望，因为在苏美互换照会后所燃起的荧荧之火正在消失，而且他们认为美国在这火上泼冷水，是美国的错误。
