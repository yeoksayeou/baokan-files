Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Front, May 23rd: Terrified by the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, Yan's troops in Jinzhong are increasingly pessimistic. The bandit Yan Xishan's confidence in his defense works is waning, as evidenced by a speech he made on April 15th, in which he said, "In 1947, I felt that the fortifications built in 1946 were insufficient, and this year I feel that what was done last year is also insufficient." A puppet township captain in Pingyao said, "They can attack wherever they want, we are finished!" The puppet township office of Zhongjie in Jiexiu dare not spend the night in the village and hide in the wilderness to sleep. To this end, the Yan bandits planned to "conscript another 320,000 civilian laborers to build 1,200 bunkers." However, when building fortifications near Taiyuan, only more than 5,000 elderly, weak, and women were forcibly conscripted from various counties. A pregnant woman in Hongxiang Village, Jiexiu, was forced to perform corvee labor, resulting in a miscarriage in a pile of rocks.

This newspaper, Taiyue, 22nd: The Yan bandits in Pingyao and Jiexiu, seeing that the general trend is over, are making a desperate struggle to plunder wildly. On May 1st, the Yan bandits invaded the border areas of Jiexiu and Qinshui, grabbing people and livestock wherever they went, digging holes everywhere to rob grain, and destroying farm tools. They took away what they could, and burned what they couldn't. For example, in Baohe Village, District 1 of Jiexiu, eight out of ten livestock were taken away by the enemy. In the entire district, a total of 56 livestock were taken away, 50 young and middle-aged people were captured, 276 dan of grain, more than 400 sheep, and countless clothes and furniture were plundered. Even water buckets, pots, and bowls were taken away. The old, weak, women, and children in Banyugou Bottom hid in the coal mines. The Yan bandits used the brutal methods of the Japanese invaders against these defenseless people, using kerosene, chili powder, and sulfur to set fires to smoke them out, and using a winnowing fan to blow air in. After the enemy left, our young and middle-aged masses rushed to rescue them. Besides rescuing seventy or eighty people, nine people were smoked to death in Banyugou, and twenty-four people were smoked to death in Gou Bottom. After this looting, nine out of ten families had nothing to eat.

　　害怕我军强大攻势晋中阎匪悲观失望
    【新华社晋绥二十三日电】慑于解放军强大攻势，晋中阎匪悲观情绪日益增长，阎贼锡山对其防御工事信心日低，这从他四月十五日的一次讲话中得到证明，他说：“三十六年感到三十五年做的工事不够，今年又感到去年做的也不够了。”平遥某伪乡队长说：“人家要打哪里就打哪里，咱们快完了！”介休中街伪乡公所不敢在村内过夜，躲到野外露宿。为此阎匪计划“再征三十二万民工修碉一千二百个”。但在修太原附近工事时，只从各县强征来五千多老弱妇女。介休洪相村一孕妇被迫支差，竟致小产于乱石堆中。
    【本报太岳廿二日电】平、介阎匪见大势已去，作垂死挣扎疯狂抢劫。五月一日，阎匪进犯介（休）、沁（源）边沿，所到之处，见人就抓，见牲口就拉，到处掘洞抢粮，破坏农具，能拿走的拿走，不能拿走的烧毁。如介休一区堡和村，共有十头牲口被敌拉去八头，全区共拉走牲口五十六头，抓走青壮年五十人，抢走粮食二百七十六石，羊子四百多只，衣服家具无数，连水桶锅碗都抢走不少。板峪沟底的老弱妇孺钻在煤窑里，阎匪对这些毫无抵抗力的人民，采用日寇的残暴办法，用煤油、辣椒面、硫磺点火来熏，扇车往里扇风。敌人走后，我青壮年群众赶来营救，除救活七八十人外，板峪熏死九人，沟底熏死二十四人。经过这次洗劫，十家就有九家没吃的。
