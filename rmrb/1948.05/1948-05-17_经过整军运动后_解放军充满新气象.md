Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th—After the new-style military reorganization movement, the People's Liberation Army in various places is full of a new atmosphere.
	(1) The landlord of a certain company's fifth squad of the Chahar-Suiyuan Military Region was captured by the bandit army to repair fortifications. The squad ate the landlord's vegetables. Soldier Yang Guangpu wrote a note and put 5,000 yuan in the pot, "Old fellow, the People's Liberation Army is the people's army. Public purchase and public sale. We ate your vegetables, and now we give you 5,000 yuan at the market price. Please accept it."
	(2) During the reorganization of a certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, a "One Heart" movement was launched, and there was a warm discussion on how to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. Soldiers of the Second Company proposed: 1. Be loyal and frank to the revolution and be of one heart with Chairman Mao; 2. Serve the people forever, and never forget suffering and hatred, etc. After everyone agreed, in-depth reviews were carried out, and other companies have also started discussions.
	(3) After the new-style military reorganization of the "Three Great Democracies," cadres and soldiers of a certain unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army actively practiced martial arts. Soldiers of the Second Platoon of the Ninth Company organized revenge meetings, and small groups spontaneously convened "Zhuge Liang Meetings" to study various techniques or conduct exercises. On rainy days, some squads created a method of practicing combat formations indoors with beans, and some drew serial village combat diagrams on the walls for learning. The Second Company practiced bridging, and the soldiers who fell into the water discussed while drying their clothes. After two days of practice and discussion, the action was twice as fast as before. The companies also applied to their superiors for battle.
	(4) Cadres of the Political Department of a certain unit of the Jinchaji People's Liberation Army went deep into the companies, broke the idea of being guests, carried things for soldiers during marches, comforted and encouraged them in various classes during encampments, urged them to wash their feet, and helped convene five-minute commendation meetings.

　　经过整军运动后
  　解放军充满新气象
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各地解放军经过新式整军运动后，充满着新气象。（一）察南解放军某连五班住地的房东被匪军抓去修工事，该班吃了房东家的菜，战士杨光普写了张条子和五千元放在锅里，“老乡，解放军是人民的队伍，公买公卖，我们吃了你的菜，现按市价给你五千元，请收。”
    （二）东北解放军某部在整训中，开展一条心运动，热烈讨论怎样做毛主席的好战士，二连战士提出：一、对革命忠实坦白，和毛主席一条心；二、永远为人民服务，不忘苦和仇等五个条件。经大家同意后，即进行深入检讨，其他各连队亦已展开讨论。
    （三）中原解放军某部经过三大民主的新式整军后，战士干部积极练武。九连二班战士组织报仇会，三五成群的自动召开“诸葛亮会”，学习研究各种技术或作演习。下雨天有的班创造了用豆子在屋里演习战斗队形的办法，有的在墙上画成连环的村落战斗图样来学习。二连演习架桥，掉下水的战士一面烤衣一面讨论，经过两天的演习和讨论后，动作比以前快了一倍。各连队并纷向上级请战。
    （四）晋察冀解放军某部政治部干部深入连队，打破做客思想，在行军中替战士背东西，宿营时到各班安慰鼓励，督促洗脚，帮助召集五分钟的奖评会。
