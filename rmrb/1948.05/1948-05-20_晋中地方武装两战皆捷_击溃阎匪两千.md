On the 9th, our army engaged in a fierce battle for six hours with the entire 206th Regiment of the 69th Division of the Yan bandits and another battalion of over a thousand bandits in the Wangjiashan Quansi area northwest of Wenshui, completely defeating the bandits and capturing a portion of them. On the same day, the defeated bandits reassembled the 3rd Regiment of the 37th Division of the Yan bandits and the "8th Column" reorganized from the Japanese puppet army, totaling over 2,300 men, and invaded our territory again. On the 10th, they were intercepted by our forces at Zhoujiashan, northwest of Wenshui. After seven hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated again. The militia from various routes pursued and intercepted the fleeing enemies, who scurried back to their strongholds.
