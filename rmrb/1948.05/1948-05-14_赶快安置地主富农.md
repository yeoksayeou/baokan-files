    Hurry and Settle Landlords and Rich Peasants
    In the past, landlords and rich peasants exploited and oppressed us, and we should have struggled against them. But dragging on without settling them is a bad thing. For example, in Nan Guan, Neiqiu, a mutual aid team gave a landlord half wages, and in Saiping, Gaoping, a landlord was starved to death… This is not right. The Communist Party's policy is to eliminate the landlord class, which exploits people, not to kill every one of them. Doing so is not beneficial to ourselves either. "More people, better work," now every village is short of manpower, whether it is raising crops, substituting plowing, or carrying stretchers, there are so many things to do, we work day and night, and we are still overwhelmed. If we let the landlords and rich peasants live, wouldn't they be able to do their part? Wouldn't our strength be greater if they did their part? If we don't settle them, but constantly control them and starve them, over time they will have evil thoughts, or go begging everywhere, disrupting the peace of the world, and everyone will feel uncomfortable. We should hurry and settle them, let them engage in production properly, and get a season's harvest, residence and livelihood.

    赶快安置地主富农
    过去地主富农剥削咱压迫咱，咱们应该斗争他。可是拖拉下去不安置就坏事了。譬如内邱南关有个互助组，给地主一半工资，高平塞平把一个地主饿死………这都是不对的。共产党的政策是消灭地主这个剥削人的阶级，不是杀掉他们每一个人。这样做，对咱们自己也不利。“人多好做活”，现在每个村里人手很缺乏，养种地，代耕，抬担架，一摊子事情，黑夜白天干，还忙不过来。如果咱们让地主、富农也能生活下去，他们不是也能够做一份吗？他们做了一份，力量不是更大了吗？要是不去安置他们，成天管制他，饿他，时候长了他们就要胡生邪心，或者到处要饭吃，捣乱得世道也不安生，大家心里也不痛快。咱们赶快安置他们，让他们好好闹生产，得一季庄稼，居住生活。
