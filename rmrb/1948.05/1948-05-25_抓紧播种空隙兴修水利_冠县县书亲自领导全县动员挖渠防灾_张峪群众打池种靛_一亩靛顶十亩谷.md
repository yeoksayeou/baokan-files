Grasp the Planting Gap to Build Water Conservancy
	The Guan County Secretary Personally Leads a County-Wide Mobilization to Dig Ditches for Flood Prevention
	Zhangyu Masses Dig Ponds to Plant Indigo
	One Mu of Indigo is Worth Ten Mu of Grain
	[Guan County News] Guan County has many low-lying areas, and even slightly heavy rains cause flooding. According to the Construction Section's statistics, over 700 hectares of the county's more than 9,000 hectares of land were flooded last spring. In the first, fourth, and fifth districts alone, 227 hectares of more than 3,000 hectares were flooded, making it impossible for the masses in the flooded villages to live. Although 190,000 jin of grain and 76 million yuan were loaned, the problem was not fully solved. Guan County had planned to dig two ditches last year, but due to the large amount of war work last year, such as digging a ditch from Guancheng to Jia Town, which is 30-40 li long, would require 100,000 laborers, so the work was not started. Although the Hongyan ditch was started, it was only half-finished. This year, the leadership decided to mobilize forces under difficult material conditions and spend tens of thousands of jin of rice to eliminate this disaster for the masses. It was also decided to dig these two ditches during the gap between spring plowing and planting, before other farm work began. Currently, more than 7,000 people in the third and fourth districts have started work. The other six districts each retain one village cadre to support the work, and the rest are mobilized together, a force of about 20,000 people, led by County Party Secretary Su Gang and the County Government Secretary and Head of the Construction Section to organize the headquarters. Each district cadre retains one or two people to support the work, while others form central teams by area and village, with the district cadres personally leading and supervising the ditch digging. Each village has also organized squads and teams. Currently, all men in the six districts who can dig ditches arrived at the work site on the 10th of this month. According to the Construction Section's calculations, digging these two ditches will reduce flooding by at least 400 hectares. (Shen Yaojiang)
	[Shahe News] On the evening of April 25th, Zhangyu Village in the third district of Shahe held a production committee meeting, calling for the planting of indigo. After calculation and debate, everyone said it was profitable. The only problem was that they had never planted it before, and they were afraid of losing money. If they didn't plant it, others would get rich, and they would regret it later. Later, most people said it was good to plant, but they didn't have ponds. Old man Zhang Xiangeng said: "One mu of indigo is worth ten mu of grain. As long as everyone works hard, building indigo ponds will not be a problem, and I will be responsible for building the ponds." But the village cadres were afraid of making mistakes and did not take the lead. The next night, a cadre meeting was held to discuss: Is it to seek benefits for the masses, let the masses get rich, will the masses oppose it? If you have made a mistake, if you do not do it, is it okay? After discussion, it was agreed that if you seek benefits for the masses, the masses will support you, and some mistakes can be forgiven. So, together with activists, they went to mobilize the masses to build indigo ponds and plant indigo.
	On the evening of May 1st, a general meeting was held, calling for investing in indigo ponds and planting indigo. Twenty-two people signed up to invest on the spot. Zhang Xiangen and five others were in one group, building three ponds, and the other sixteen were in one group, building three ponds. The village chief declared: "If anyone has difficulties, I am responsible for going to the bank and credit union to get loans to buy lime and indigo seeds." The next day, Zhang Xiujing got up before dawn and went to Gangye to call Lao Kun, an expert in building indigo. After measuring the foundation, they started work, digging pits, carrying stones, carrying lime, and carrying yellow mud. Duan Lao Kun talked about planting methods and building methods, and promised to come and help teach how to make indigo when making indigo. In this way, everyone was very energetic in building. That night, another general meeting was held, specially inviting Duan Lao Kun to talk about planting indigo. Lao Kun said: "This year I planted twelve mu, and the money I earned is enough for me to spend for the rest of my life. Last year when I was making indigo in the fifth district, I heard that some people saw that the indigo seedlings did not come up, so they said they were blind, and planted vegetables instead. Some used empty drills to sow, and bought seeds but didn't plant them. Later, when they saw others getting rich, look at how regretful they were! The director of the Agricultural Association in ×× village deliberately didn't plant, and his wife got angry with him. Children in Dongmazhuang Elementary School dug up two mu of wasteland and planted indigo, and made 180 jin." After the meeting, everyone said that they must plant indigo! Now the six ponds have been built, and the whole village has formed a climax of buying indigo seeds and planting indigo seedlings. According to incomplete statistics, it has been decided to plant more than 60 mu. (Fan Youzhi, Xu Qianlin)

　　抓紧播种空隙兴修水利
  　冠县县书亲自领导全县动员挖渠防灾
    张峪群众打池种靛
  　一亩靛顶十亩谷
    【冠县消息】冠县凹地很多，雨水略大就闹水害。据建设科统计，全县九千多顷地内去春就淹了七百多顷。光一、四、五三个区，三千多顷地就淹了二百二十七顷，被淹村庄群众生活没法，虽贷了十九万斤粮及七千六百万元的款也没全部解决问题。冠县去年就准备挖两道渠，但因去年战勤多工程大，如挖冠城到贾镇东三、四十里长一道渠，得用十万个工，因此没动工。红眼渠虽动工，挖的半半拉拉的就算啦。今年领导决定在物质困难的条件下，也要动员力量，用几十万斤米的代价给群众除这一害。并决定在春耕播种完，其他农活不到的这个空隙，挖完这两道渠。现三、四区动员七千多人已动工，其他六个区每村留一村干支持工作，其余一齐动员，约两万人的力量，由县委书记苏钢同志和县府秘书、建设科长等，共同组织大队部领导。各区区干部留一两人支持工作，其他以片村组成中队部，区干亲自领导督促挖渠，各村也都组织了分队、班。现六个区能挖渠的男人，都由本月十号到了工上。据建设科计算，挖好这两道渠，最少也可少淹四百多顷地。（申耀江）
    【沙河消息】四月二十五日晚上，沙河三区张峪村开生产委员会，号召种靛。经过算帐咯吵，都说有利。就是以前没有种过，种上怕搭了；不种吧，别人种上发了财，后悔就迟了。后来大部分说种好，就是没有池子。老汉张先庚说：“一亩靛能顶十亩谷。只要大家干，打靛池不成问题，我负责把池子打好。”但村干部怕犯错误，不带头干。第二天晚上开干部会讨论：为群众谋利益，叫群众发财，群众反对不反对？自己有错误，不干是否就没事了？经过讨论，都认为为群众谋利益，群众就拥护，有些错误也能原谅。于是结合积极分子，分头去动员群众打靛池种靛。
    五月一日晚召开大会，号召入股打靛池、种靛。当场报名入股廿二人。张先庚等六人在一处，打三个池子，其余十六人在一处，打三个池子。村长声明：“谁有困难，我负责去银行和信用社贷款，买石灰和靛籽。”第二天，张修敬起五更就去岗冶叫来打靛能手段老坤，把地基量好，就动起工来，刨坑、扛石头、驮石灰、驮黄泥。段老坤讲着种法打法，并保证打靛时来帮助教会打靛。这样，大家打的很有劲。当天晚上又开全体大会，专请段老坤讲种靛，老坤说：“今年我种了十二亩，赚的钱就够我这辈子花了。去年我在五区打靛时，听说有人看见靛苗不上来，就说瞎了，又种上菜，有的使空耧耩，买下子也不种。后来见别人发了财，你看他那个后悔劲！××村农会主任故意不种，后来他老婆给他好生气。东马庄小学儿童刨了二亩荒地种上靛，打了一百八十斤。”散会后，都说咱一定要种靛！现已把六个池子打好，全村已形成买靛籽，下靛秧高潮。据不完全统计，已决定种六十余亩。（范有志、许乾林）
