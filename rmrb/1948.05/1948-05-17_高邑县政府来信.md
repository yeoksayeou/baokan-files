	Letter from the Gaoyi County Government
    After hearing Li Zhilan's account, this newspaper immediately sent a letter to the Gaoyi County Government to investigate. The reply is as follows: Comrade Editor:
    Regarding the matter mentioned in your letter about Li Fake, from Niu Fort, Tenth District of Wu'an, being beaten to death by village cadres in Zhonghan Village, our county, and his pharmacy being confiscated, we dispatched personnel to investigate upon receiving your letter. The investigation revealed the following: Li Fake brought his entire family to beg for food and arrived here. Their lives were very difficult. Later, he opened a small pharmacy (the house and furniture belonged to the landlord, and he bought some goods on credit from relatives and friends in the city). Over the past few years, he has been a good person with good reputation among the masses. On the evening of August 26th last year, the village assigned Li, Zhou Kuang, and Zhou Zhaizi from the village to stand guard on the roof at the north entrance of the village. Li was on the first shift, Zhou Zhaizi on the second, and Zhou Kuang on the third, sleeping at home. They were supposed to wake each other for shift changes. Two landmines were planted below the house where they were standing guard (very close). One exploded (according to the masses, it may have been set off by a dog). Shortly after, another one exploded at the west entrance. The commander and a public security officer, along with two militiamen, went to investigate and asked Li how the explosion happened. Li didn't know. According to Zhou Zhaizi, when he woke up, he saw Li standing on the corner of the roof. The public security officer asked Li in the street (Li must not have been at the edge of the roof at the time, since the landmine was planted right next to the wall, and he would have seen it if he was on the edge of the roof). The public security officer told Li to open the door and go inside, and then the other landmine exploded (this one was right next to the door), slightly injuring the public security officer, but not seriously. This made them angry. They called the three guards to the headquarters. Public Security Officer Geng Deshu broke Zhou Zhaizi's arm, locked him in the west room, and then severely beat Li Fake before hanging him from the beam in the south room. Zhou Kuang was also detained in the south room. When Li didn't respond to their calls, Zhou Kuang said to them, "It doesn't matter, you won't be responsible if he dies." The next morning, they found Li dead. Knowing he was in the wrong, he then said that he heard Li talking to special agents, saw someone making a fire, and saw shadows moving around, etc. In short, he portrayed Li as a special agent. Although he said so, the masses all believed that Li Fake was a good person. Even when Li Zhilan came to inquire about her father's situation, he still said he was a special agent. Geng Deshu acted like a tyrant and committed many bad deeds in the village. Later, he joined the army and left. After clarifying the situation, a mass meeting was held in the village, and everyone said: Since Old Li was beaten to death, who isn't afraid? Thinking about it now is still frightening. Retired soldier Old Chu said that in the past he wasn't afraid, as long as he was allowed to speak, but when he saw Old Li being beaten to death, and the village head not allowing anyone to say anything, he was really scared. Later, he moved to Yuanshi to live (now he has moved back). Everyone agreed to return the pharmacy.
    After investigation, it is confirmed that Li was not a special agent. It has been decided to return the pharmacy to its original owner, and the Wu'an government has been notified to inform Li Zhilan to come and take it back. As for the issue of the killing, since these people are not at home now, and the village has not yet undergone land redistribution, it will be dealt with specifically during the redistribution.
    What are your opinions? We hope to receive a letter in reply. (Gaoyi County Government)
    On the 11th of this month, Li Zhilan came to this newspaper again and said that the new farmers' association of Zhonghan Village had notified him to go and take over the pharmacy, and that the masses did not agree with the old cadres beating his father to death. However, Li still didn't believe it and was afraid to go. After explaining in detail the laws protecting industry and commerce and firmly returning the belongings of wrongly accused households, Li happily went home to prepare for the journey.

### 高邑县政府来信

专栏：群众呼声

　　高邑县政府来信
    听了李芝兰的诉说，本报当即去信请高邑县政府调查，复信如下：编辑同志：
    来信谈武安十区牛＠堡李发科在敝县中韩村被村干将其打死，并将药铺没收事件，我们接信后即派人前往调查，据调查情况是这样的：李发科是带全家要饭吃到这里，生活很困难，后来即开设一个小药铺（房子家具是用地主的，到城内乡亲关系赊帐买点货），在这几年以来为人还不错，在群众中威信很好。去年八月二十六晚上，村上派李与该村周匡、周宅子三人在村北口房上站岗，李为第一班，周宅子第二班，当时在房上睡，周匡第三班在家睡。换岗时叫。站岗的房子下面（很近）按有两颗地雷，响了一颗（据群众谈可能是狗弄响的），不多时在西口又响了一个，指挥部公安员带两个民兵前去查看，问李是怎样响的，李不知道。据周宅子谈当惊醒宅子时，见李在房角上立着，公安员在街里问李（当时李一定是没在房檐那里，地雷即在房跟按着，如在房檐上一定能看见。）公安员让李开门进去，把那一个也＠响了（这一个即在门旁边），把公安员炸着一点，不碍事。这一下急了，把三个站岗的叫到指挥部，公安员耿德书把周宅子的胳膊打断，押在西屋，又把李发科吊打了一顿，押在南屋吊在梁上，周匡也在南屋押着，当叫不应李时，周匡即对他们说：“不要紧，死了不用你负责。”第二天天明见李死了。死后他自知理曲，便说他听见李与特务说话来，又见有人弄火明来，见人影走来等等，总而言之，把李说成个特务。虽然他这样说，群众却都认为李发科是个好人，一直到李芝兰来打问其父情况时，他还是说是特务。耿德书在村横行霸道坏事很多，以后他也参军走了。情况弄清后，在这村开群众大会，都说：自从打死老李谁不怕呢？现在想起来还害怕。退伍军人老楚说过去我不怕，只要准许我说话即不怕，一见把老李打死了，长圆不允许说，我可真怕了。以后就搬到元氏住去了（现又搬回来了）。大家同意把药铺退回去。
    经研究李不是特务是肯定的，决定将药铺退回原主，并已通知武安政府转知李芝兰来接收。打死人问题，因现在这一些人都不在家了，这村现在也没搞平分，将来平分时再具体处理。
    你们有何意见，希来信是盼。（高邑县政府）
    本月十一日，李芝兰又来本报谈，中韩村新农会已通知他前去接收药铺，并说旧干部打死他父亲，群众都不同意。但李仍不相信，不敢前去，经将我保护工商业与斗错户东西坚决退还的法令详细解释后，李才高兴的回家准备盘缠去了。
