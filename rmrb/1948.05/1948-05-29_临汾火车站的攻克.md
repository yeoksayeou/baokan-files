　　The Capture of Linfen Railway Station
　　Zeming
　　The railway station is about 500 meters away from the East Gate of Linfen City. Its terrain is elevated, and it connects to the Electric Light Company and the East Gate in the south, making it an extremely important barrier in the northeast of Linfen. The Chiang-Yan bandit troops had painstakingly strengthened the fortifications here. They dug three outer trenches more than two zhang wide and deep around the station, strung several lines of barbed wire along the trench edges, and surrounded two large bunkers with more than twenty pillboxes, with secret passages directly connecting to the Electric Light Company and the East Gate. When Linfen was in dire straits, Yan bandit chief Liang Peihuang constantly issued orders to his subordinates: "Defend the station to the death" and "Share life and death with the station." However, when the bandit troops came into contact with the People's Liberation Army, they were beaten to a bloody pulp by the Liberation Army. The Liberation Army, at the cost of only two minor injuries, completely captured the station.
　　The battle began on the afternoon of March 17th. Our powerful artillery first bombarded the two large bunkers at the station. Amidst the dust and smoke, the assault troops of the 9th Company of Unit 1317 and the 8th Company of Unit 1315 quickly approached the enemy. The engineers were the first to jump out of the trenches, carrying explosives, and charged through the 30-meter blockade line, successively blasting through the three outer trenches and barbed wire. Grenade-throwing hero He Yimin and others quickly passed through the thick smoke of the explosions, pounced over the three outer trenches, and delivered a row of grenades into the No. 1 pillbox. The No. 1 pillbox was destroyed, followed by the second, the third... more than twenty pillboxes all met their fate in fierce explosions. At this point, the enemy completely lost confidence in holding their fortifications and fled in all directions like stray dogs. But no matter where the enemy fled, above ground or underground (in tunnels), they could not escape the dragnet of the Liberation Army. The bandit troops were annihilated one by one, and the station was completely occupied by our army.

　　临汾火车站的攻克
    泽民
    火车站距临汾城东关约五百公尺，地势耸立，南接电灯公司和东关，是临汾东北极为重要的屏障。蒋阎匪军曾费尽心机的加强这里的工事，在车站周围挖了两丈多宽深的三道外壕，壕沿上打上几道铁丝网，二十余个地堡包围着两个大碉，有暗道直通电灯公司和东关。当临汾告急的时候，阎匪首梁培璜不断给下面下命令：“要死守车站”，“要和车站共存亡”。但是，当匪军和人民解放军一相接触，就被解放军打的头破血流，解放军只以两名轻伤的代价，即全部攻占车站。
    战斗开始于三月十七日下午，我强大的炮火首先向车站的两个大碉轰击，在尘烟满天当中，突击部队一三一七部第九连、一三一五部第八连，迅速接近了敌人，工兵们最先跳出了战壕，扛上炸药，冲过了三十公尺的封锁线，连续爆破了三道外壕和铁丝网。投弹英雄贺一民等飞快的穿过爆破的浓烟，扑过三道外壕，把一排排的炸弹送到第一号地堡里去。第一号地堡被毁灭了，接着第二个、第三个…………二十余个地堡，都在猛烈的爆炸中结束了它们的命运。至此，敌人完全失去固守工事的信心，如同丧家之狗，四散奔逃。但不管敌人逃到地上地下（地道），都逃不出解放军的天罗地网，匪军们一个个全部就歼，车站为我军完全占领。
