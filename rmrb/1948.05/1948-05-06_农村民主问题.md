　　The Problem of Rural Democracy
According to the reflections from the Second Joint Representative Meeting of Farmers in the Seventh and Eighth Districts of Yu County, an extreme tendency of democratization is developing in the rural areas that have undergone land reform. Due to the unrestrained and undisciplined behavior of some farmers, production and support for the front lines have been affected, as well as the work morale of the new cadres who emerged during the land reform. The representatives spoke enthusiastically at the meeting. Some said, "In the past, the cadres were not democratic, but the work could be done. Now that we have democracy, we can't even afford stretchers, and no one listens to us." Some said, "The higher authorities want us to listen to the village heads, but when we beat the gong to call a meeting, we can't even get the village heads to come. The representatives run all over the place, but we can't gather enough people. When the representatives do things themselves, they are accused of 'acting independently'." Some said, "Everyone has their own democracy, a hundred people have a hundred democracies. If you don't follow their wishes, they say you are 'acting independently' and talk behind your back." Some said, "We've been holding meetings for several months, but the masses don't come. We have to let them be. The representatives have to come, but they don't have enough firewood or water at home, and their wives scold them when they go back. If things aren't done well, the masses complain again." Some representatives even said, "Democracy has spoiled things, like a horse that has been freed from its halter and runs wild." "Democracy was okay during the land reform, but now that the land has been divided, we can't have any more democracy." After a long discussion, the representatives confirmed that the above problems existed in all villages. But it cannot be blamed on democracy being bad, nor can the masses be blamed. The reasons are multifaceted:

　　(1) There are deviations in leadership regarding democratic education. The representatives said, "When you come to the village and hold a meeting, you always say: 'The masses can do whatever they want, the masses can think whatever they want.' Even we representatives don't know what democracy really is. If everyone can do whatever they want, then things will be difficult." (2) The handling of cadres and party members who made mistakes during the land reform was not comprehensive. Their merits and demerits, the seriousness of their offenses, were not clearly distinguished. Only one side of the story was heard, and even the opinions of a few or individual backward masses were accommodated, affecting the representatives' willingness to work boldly, fearing mistakes that would be handed over to the masses for processing, fearing retaliation from bad people. The representatives said, "We are like daughters-in-law in the village. We know that some people are doing wrong, but we dare not speak out, fearing that they will complain behind our backs." (3) Last winter's land reform was not closely integrated with winter production. Since last August, almost every village has been holding meetings every day. Some places produce little grain and don't have enough to eat, and they rely mainly on selling pears and fruits in the winter to exchange for grain. However, because road passes were not issued for attending meetings, the income of the masses was affected, making them tired of attending meetings. At the same time, the powers of the representatives were not clearly defined, coupled with a fear of taking responsibility. Therefore, some things that the representatives could have handled directly were also discussed at mass meetings, further increasing the number of meetings and making the masses even more tired. As soon as they heard the gong for a meeting, they tried to avoid coming. Those who came saw that few people came, and they didn't come next time. (4) There was no necessary disciplinary guarantee. Some representatives demanded that work be carried out relying on discipline. Some said, "If you don't come to the meeting, you will be fined two catties of oil, let's see who dares not to come." The correct opinion believes that "In the past, cadres made mistakes because of coercion and commandism, oppressing the masses, handling affairs subjectively, and not understanding the feelings of the masses. The masses were afraid to speak out. After the land reform, the masses are enlightened, and it is no longer possible to use coercion and commandism." His speech was supported by all the representatives. After discussion, everyone agreed that one cannot simply rely on discipline to handle affairs, but there must be necessary discipline. "Discipline is for unruly people, without a little discipline, there will be no law and order." "Discipline should be democratically formulated by the masses, not just by the representatives." (5) The burden on the representatives is too heavy. All the work in the village is placed on the shoulders of the representatives, and the representatives do not have a clear division of labor. Some representatives are irresponsible, and things are left to the chairman and one or two deputy representatives, who are too busy to handle everything and delay their own production, so they are worried and uneasy about their work.

　　Based on the above review, this representative meeting put forward opinions on improving work and correcting deviations in the future. (1) First, criticize those who are unwilling to be representatives, saying: "Our representatives are all half-hearted and unwilling to take responsibility, how can we unite the masses well?" "The masses elected us as representatives because they look up to us, and we must serve the masses well. As long as we can do the work well, it doesn't matter if we work harder." Most of the representatives realized that turning over is not just about dividing things, but more importantly, turning over politically. "If we don't grab the seal of power in our hands, we won't be able to protect the fruits of the division. After finally conquering the country, we want to take off our robes and abdicate. If you don't sit, someone will want to sit. If landlords, rich peasants, and bad people come to power, we won't have a way to live." "In the past, it was completely 'independent', coercion and commandism, everything was decided by the cadres. This time, we have democracy, it's like water that has been forced up, breaking through the sluice gate and flowing everywhere. In the future, it should be guided into the canal." (2) Strengthen democratic education, so that the masses understand that democracy is not about everyone doing whatever they want, but about everyone boldly speaking and arguing during discussions, and making resolutions based on the correct opinions of the majority. A minority who disagree must also follow the majority. Representatives listen to the masses, and they must listen to the correct opinions of the majority of the masses, not follow the incorrect opinions of a few. If the opinions of the minority are correct and the opinions of the majority are inappropriate, persuasion and education should be carried out. At the same time, some necessary discipline should be formulated on the basis of the voluntary consensus of the majority of the masses. (3) Rectify rural organizations and re-establish village governments. The director and deputy director of the representative meeting concurrently serve as the chairman and vice-chairman of the village government, the armed committee member concurrently serves as the stretcher team leader, the deputy armed committee member concurrently serves in charge of security work, and the secretary concurrently serves in charge of grain and fodder work, each with their own responsibilities. The administrative village government can receive stipends for four people to subsidize the living expenses of the cadres. Usually, the cadres take turns on duty, and the rest can still produce as usual. At the same time, reorganize the farmers' association to unite all the peasants. (4) Based on the experience of party rectification in Pingshan, fully mobilize the masses and promote democracy inside and outside the party, in order to distinguish between good and bad, merits and demerits, right and wrong, and seriousness, and to reward those who should be rewarded and punish those who should be punished, and to deal with the cadres and party members being reviewed in a realistic manner, so that the masses inside and outside the party are satisfied. Achieve the goal of educating and improving party members, cadres, and the masses, and eliminate their unease and confrontational emotions. (5) Spring plowing has begun. In order not to delay production and reduce meetings, the representatives must have certain powers. Specific tasks should be executed and handled by the representatives, and there is no need to hold meetings for every small thing. General issues can be resolved by convening a representative meeting. If the representative meeting cannot resolve it, then a farmers' meeting should be convened. When a farmers' meeting needs to be convened, it can be held during production breaks, and everyone should be notified in advance to be prepared and to deliberate thoroughly to save time at the meeting.

　　After the problems were solved, the morale of the representatives generally improved. Some said, "Now we have found the root of the problem, and it will be easier to work when we go back." Some said, "As long as we are upright and unite the masses well, we are not afraid of bad people taking advantage of us."

　　农村民主问题
    据崞县七、八两区农民第二届联合代表会议反映，经过土地改革的农村，正在发展着一种极端民主化的偏向。由于一部分农民放任无纪律，影响了生产和支援前线等工作，也影响了土改中涌现出来的新干部的工作情绪。代表们在会上热烈发言，有的说：“以前的干部不民主，可是工作都能办成，如今民主了，反而担架派不起，说话没人听。”有的说：“上级要我们听掌柜的话办事，可是开会打破锣，掌柜的也请不到，代表跑断腿，也找不齐人，代表们自己办了，又说是‘独主’。”有的说：“一人一个民主，一百人一百个民主，不依人家的心思办，就说是‘独主’，背后乱说。”有的说：“开了几个月的会，群众不来，只好由人家，代表总得来，家里少柴没水，回去老婆骂，事情办不好，群众又反映。”有的代表甚至这样说：“就是民主坏了，好比脱了笼头的马，就跑开了。”“土地改革中可以民主，如今地分完了，可不能再民主了。”讨论了很久，代表们确认上述问题各村都存在。但不能怪民主不好，也不能责备群众，其原因是多方面的：
    （一）领导上在民主教育上有偏差，代表们说：“你们到村里，一开会，就说：‘群众要怎办就怎办，群众想怎办就怎办。’‘连咱们代表也闹不清究竟甚叫个民主，谁想怎就怎，那事情就很难办。’（二）土改中处理犯错误的干部和党员时不全面看问题，对他们的功过，轻重没分清楚，打一面官司，甚至迁就了少部分或个别落后群众的意见，影响到代表们不敢大胆工作，怕犯错交群众处理，怕坏人报复。代表们说：“咱在村里就是婆子，明知有些人作的不对，也不敢说，怕人家背后反映。”（三）去冬土改没与冬季生产紧密结合。各村从去年八月以来，差不多天天开会，有的地方产粮少，不够吃，又遭荒旱，主要靠冬季卖梨果换粮食，但因开会不放路条，影响到群众收入，对开会厌烦。同时代表职权不明确，加上怕负责任的情绪，因此本来代表可以直接处理的一些事情，也召开群众大会讨论，更增加了会议的次数，更使群众厌烦。一听到打锣开会，都捱着不来，来了的见人来的少，下次也不来了。（四）没有必要的纪律保证。有的代表要求依靠纪律进行工作。有的说：“不来开会，罚上二斤油，看谁敢不来。”正确的意见认为：“以前干部犯错误，就是因为强迫命令，压迫群众，凭主观办事，不揣摸群众的心事，群众有话不敢说。土地改革后，群众觉悟了，再想要强迫命令可不行了。”他的发言受到全体代表的拥护，经大家讨论，一致认为，不能单纯靠纪律办事，没有必要的纪律也不行。“纪律是待灰人的，没有点纪律无法无天了。”“纪律要群众民主订，不能单由代表订。”（五）代表负担太重。村里一切工作都压在代表头上，代表也没有明确的分工，有一些代表不负责任，事情便都搁在主任代表一两个人头上，忙不过来，又耽误自己生产，因此对工作发愁不安心。
    根据以上检讨，此次代表会议提出了今后改进工作，纠正偏向的意见。（一）首先对不愿当代表的进行批评说：“咱们代表都三心二意，不想负责，怎能把群众团结好。”“群众选咱当代表，是看起咱，咱就要好好为群众服务，只要能把工作办好，咱们多辛苦点没关系。”大部分代表都认识到翻身不单是分点东西，更重要的是政治上翻身。“印把子不抓到咱手里，分下的果实也保不住，好容易打下江山，倒想脱袍退位了，你不坐，早就有人想坐，地主富农坏人上了台，又没咱的活法了。”“以前完全是‘独立’，强迫命令，甚也由干部，这回闹民主，好象逼起的水，冲开了闸口，到处流，以后应当往渠里引。”（二）加强民主教育，使群众了解民主，不是谁想怎就怎，而是在讨论时，大家大胆发言争论，根据大多数人的正确意见订出决议，少数人不同意也必须随上走，代表听群众的话办事，是听大多数群众正确的意见，不是跟上少数人不正确的意见跑，少数人的意见对，大多数人意见不妥当时，应说服教育，同时在大多数群众自觉自愿基础上，订一些必要的纪律。（三）整顿农村组织，重新建立村政府。代表主任与副主任兼任村政府主席与副主席，武装委员兼任担架队长，副武装委员兼任治安工作，书记兼任粮秣工作，分工负责，行政村政府可领四个人的津贴米，补助干部生活费用，平时各干部轮流值日，其余的人仍可照常生产。同时整理农会组织，团结全体农民。（四）根据平山整党经验，充分发动群众和发扬党内与党外的民主，以达到对被审查的党员干部分清好坏，分清功过，分清是非轻重，应奖者奖，应罚者罚，实事求是的处理，使党内外群众均感满意。达到教育与提高党员、干部与群众的目的，消除他们的不安与对立情绪。（五）春耕开始了，为了不耽误生产，减少开会，代表必须有一定的职权，具体工作由代表执行处理，不必抬脚动手都开会，讨论一般问题，可召集代表会解决，代表会解决不了的，再召开农民大会。需要开农民大会时，可利用生产空闲，并事先要通知大家有准备，酝酿成熟，节省大会时间。
    问题解决后，代表们情绪普遍提高，有的说：“这下就找见病根根了，回去工作就好做了。”有的说：“只要咱行的正，团结好群众，不怕坏人钻空子。”
