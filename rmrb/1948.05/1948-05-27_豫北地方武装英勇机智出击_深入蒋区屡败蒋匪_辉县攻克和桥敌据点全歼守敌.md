(This dispatch from Taihang, dated the 22nd) Since early May, local armed forces in the Fifth Military Sub-district of Northern Henan have repeatedly penetrated into KMT-occupied areas to strike at the enemy and have repelled several large-scale incursions by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, thwarting the enemy's frantic conspiracies to seize grain and conscript men. At approximately 11:00 AM on May 2nd, over seventy enemy troops from Kuai Cunying launched an attack. A unit of our Huixian Brigade fiercely attacked the enemy, chasing them to Xiaoying. After a ten-minute battle, three enemy soldiers, including the captain of the 15th Company of the puppet security force, were killed or wounded, and two were captured alive. On the 1st, over one thousand puppet bandits under Guo Qing from Anyang invaded the Suntaoji area of Yexian to seize grain and conscript men. On the morning of the 2nd, they were repelled by our Yexian Brigade, with four enemy soldiers killed or wounded. At the same time, over twenty enemy troops from the puppet township office armed forces stationed in Tunziji, Tangyin, launched an attack, entering the ambush laid by our Tangyin battalion troops near Beicheng (southeast of Yangcheng). We immediately launched a fierce assault on the enemy. After a few minutes of combat, three enemy soldiers were captured, and one light machine gun was seized. On the morning of the 4th, two battalions of the 117th Regiment of the 40th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits stationed in Anyang, combined with two companies of puppet bandits under Liu Lexian, invaded the Gaicun and Shenjiagang areas to seize grain. Upon receiving the news, our Second Detachment dispatched a unit to cut behind enemy lines, a unit to infiltrate Shenjiagang, and a unit to the west of Shenjiagang village, launching a three-pronged attack on the enemy. The enemy attempted two counterattacks, but were repelled by us each time. After two hours of fierce fighting, we finally routed the enemy, killing or wounding over forty, and capturing one enemy soldier. In total, these five battles resulted in the annihilation of seventy enemy soldiers, including over fifty killed or wounded, seventeen captured alive, two light machine guns seized, nineteen rifles, over 1,400 rounds of ammunition, and thirty-five grenades.

Furthermore, our Huixian local armed forces in the Fifth Military Sub-district, taking advantage of the emptiness in the enemy's rear due to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' incursions, captured the enemy's Heqiao stronghold in one fell swoop, annihilating all defending troops. On the night of April 30th, over four hundred puppet security troops from Huixian launched an attack on our North and South Guancun (north of Huixian city) to seize grain. A unit of our Huixian Brigade went to Lougencun to intercept the enemy's retreat. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy hastily launched a counterattack on us. After killing or wounding a part of the enemy, we moved to Bashi Mu and Xiaoying. At this time, our Huixian Brigade also learned that over two hundred troops from the 15th and 16th Companies of the puppet Huixian Security Force stationed at the Heqiao stronghold, cooperating with the aforementioned enemy troops attacking north, were engaged in fierce fighting with our militia and working teams at Nanyunmen, and the Heqiao defending troops had urgently sent over twenty troops to reinforce. A unit of our Huixian Brigade took advantage of the enemy's absence from their nest and launched a sudden attack, capturing the Heqiao stronghold in one fell swoop after five minutes of combat, annihilating all defending troops, including twelve killed or wounded, including the puppet security company commander, ten enemy soldiers captured, nineteen rifles seized, thirty hand grenades, over one hundred rounds of ammunition, and one telephone.
