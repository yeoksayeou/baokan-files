　　Battle of Liberating Linfen
　　Taiyue and Taihang Civilian Laborers Heroically Assist in the War
　　[Taiyue News] During the Linfen Campaign, civilian laborers from Jincheng, Gaoping, Yangcheng, Qinshui, Fushan, Yicheng, Hongdong, Xiangling, Jiyuan, Yuanqu, and the Taihang counties of Xiangyuan, Licheng, and Huguan enthusiastically participated, demonstrating a high level of political awareness and a spirit of hard struggle. During breaks from their work, the participating laborers also automatically publicized the Outline Land Law, painted slogans, and introduced the democratic life of the old liberated areas. On March 7th, several villages north of Linfen City had just been liberated by our army, and civilian laborers from Yangcheng automatically wrote slogans for two days, writing more than a hundred of them. Cook Yuan Qiansheng went to the families of puppet soldiers to spread propaganda: "The Eighth Route Army has a lenient policy, don't be afraid, tell your sons to come back." Wherever the laborers from various counties went, they often helped the masses with production. In three days, laborers from Jiyuan, Yangcheng, Gaoping, and other counties hoed more than 270 mu of wheat and carried hundreds of loads of fertilizer for the local people. After a large team of laborers from Yuanqu entered Dongguan with the army, everyone saw many watches, towels, shirts, and other items, but no one touched them; they even handed in eight long and short guns and three military blankets they found. The laborers completed their tasks with determination and courage. On March 7th, during the attack on the Fan Jiahe blockhouse, Han Zhangquan, Dong Yinjiang, and other eight laborers from the Fifth District Team of Yangcheng followed the troops to deliver shells. When crossing the enemy's fire blockade, they hugged the shells and rolled to our position. Because an artillery position had to be built, they were asked to go back and carry door panels. They rolled through the blockade again, hugging the door panels and rolling over. On this day, the artillery company changed seven positions, and the eight laborers completed their task by rolling in this way. During the battle of Dongguan, the laborers from Yuanqu delivered ammunition six times in one night, eating only one meal a day, but no one complained of being hungry. They said in unison, "As long as Dongguan is captured, it doesn't matter if we deliver two or three more times." "Get the ammunition to the soldiers' hands" was the consistent slogan of the laborers. On March 14th, during the attack on Nansucun, Li Yuzhi, the captain of the Fifth District Team of Yangcheng laborers, led twelve people to deliver bombs directly to the front line and used stones to open the box covers, placing them next to the soldiers so they could grab them and throw them out. They cared for the wounded meticulously. Ren Xiaofa, Ren Kuishui, and other four members of the Second Squadron of Jincheng laborers, when carrying the wounded, saw that the stretchers were not padded, causing the wounded to suffer, so they used their own travel expenses to buy half a jin of cotton and eighteen feet of cloth to make a mattress and put it on the stretcher. Influenced by him, the laborers of the Third Class of the Second Squadron also made five mattresses and put them on the stretchers. Zhang Huolin, a laborer from Yangcheng, gave his sheet to cover the wounded. The wounded said, "Don't, look, your sheet will be stained red." Huolin said, "You are bleeding on the front line, how can I be reluctant to part with a sheet!?"
　　　　The Vast Number of Peasants Around Linfen Automatically Help Repair Roads and Grind Flour
　　[Further News] In the battle to liberate Linfen, the poor peasants under the rule of the Chiang-Yan bandits unanimously rose up to actively assist the Liberation Army in combat. On March 7th, as soon as the Liberation Army approached Linfen, the puppet regime personnel in the villages fled to the city. The masses in each village automatically organized village offices to help the Liberation Army buy firewood, grind flour, and repair roads. Liu Da-xiao, a seventy-year-old hired laborer from Nan Sun Village, was a refugee who escaped from Caozhou Prefecture in Shandong. He had been here for more than forty years and still lived by working for landlords. During the slack season, he had to beg for food. The Chiang-Yan bandits also forced him to do hard labor and pay donations, making the old man unable to live or die. When the Liberation Army came, they publicized the Outline Land Law of China, and Liu Da-xiao was very happy. Although he was an old man, thin as a rake, he still insisted on helping the army. On the 15th, when the government mobilized to build the Fen River Bridge, he was the first to respond, going back and mobilizing his brother Xiao Er and his nephews Xiao Ting and Zhu Xiao to go together. When some people were slow to come, he said, "The Liberation Army is fighting Linfen to help us poor people turn over a new leaf. Why aren't you working hard for yourselves?" Zhao Wanxing, a poor peasant from Xiao Jia Village, was also a refugee who escaped from Shandong. His child worked as a farmhand for the landlord and was conscripted into the army by the Yan bandits. His family of four had no land to cultivate and worked in a paper mill, but they still couldn't make ends meet. The Yan bandits also demanded a population tax, with each person having to pay three dan and two dou of grain a year. If they couldn't pay, they would be beaten and scolded. In Xiao Jia Village, with less than a hundred households, more than thirty families were either beaten to death or forced to die. When the Liberation Army came, Zhao Wanxing and the people in the village actively helped the army fight. They had a unanimous demand: "Liberate Linfen so we can divide houses, divide land, and turn over a new leaf."

　　解放临汾战役
  　太岳太行民工英勇助战
    【太岳消息】临汾战役中，晋城、高平、阳城、沁水、浮山、翼城、洪洞、襄陵、济源、垣曲和太行襄垣、黎城、壶关等县民工踊跃参加，并表现了高度的政治觉悟与艰苦奋斗的优良品质。参战民工在工作的空隙中，并自动宣传土地法大纲，涂写标语，介绍老区的民主生活。三月七日，临汾城北有几个村庄刚被我军解放，阳城民工们就自动写标语两天，写了一百多条。伙夫原乾生向伪军家属去做宣传：“八路军是宽大政策，不怕，叫你儿子回来吧”。各县民工走到什么地方，常帮助群众生产。济源、阳城、高平等县民工，三天内给驻地群众锄麦二百七十多亩，担粪数百担。垣曲民工一大队随军进入东关后，大家看见好多手表、手巾、衬衣等东西，谁也没有去动；连他们拾到的八支长短抢，三条军毯，都交了公。民工们完成任务是坚决勇敢的。三月七号打樊家河碉堡时，阳城五区队民工韩张全、董引江等八人，跟着部队送炮弹，通过敌人火力封锁线时，他们抱着炮弹滚到我们阵地。因为要做炮兵阵地，又让他们回去扛门板。他们又滚过封锁线，抱着门板滚过来。这天炮兵一连掉换了七个阵地，八个民工就这样滚着完成了任务。垣曲民工在东关战斗中，一夜送了六次弹药，一天只吃了一顿饭，始终没人说肚饿。他们异口同声说：“只要打下东关，再送三两次都没关系”。“把弹药送到战士手里”，这是民工们一致的口号。三月十四号打南肃村时，阳城民工五区队队长栗裕智领着十二个人，把炸弹一直送到火线上，并把箱盖用石头打开，放在战士身边，抓起来就能往出投。他们爱护伤员，无微不至。晋城民工二中队任小发、任奎水等四人在抬运伤员时，看见担架上没铺的，伤员受痛，就用自己的盘费买了半斤棉花，一丈八尺布，做了一条褥子，铺在担架上。在他影响下，二中队三班民工也做了五条褥子，铺在担架上，阳城民工张火林把自己的被单给伤员盖上。伤员说：“不要，看把你的被单染红了”。火林说：“你们在前方流血，我连个被单子还舍不得！？”
    　　　　临汾周围广大农民　自动帮助修路磨面
    【又息】在解放临汾的战役中，蒋阎匪统治下的贫苦农民，一致起来积极帮助解放军作战。三月七日，解放军刚一接近临汾，各村顽伪政权人员都逃往城内。各村群众就自动组织村公所，帮助解放军买柴、磨面、修路。南孙村七十岁的老雇工刘大小，是山东曹州府逃来的难民，来这里已有四十多年了，还是靠给地主打忙工过活，闲月时候，还得讨饭吃；蒋阎匪还逼着叫他做苦工，出捐款，闹得老汉死活不得。解放军来了，宣传中国土地法大纲，刘大小非常高兴。他虽是骨瘦如柴的老人了，还是坚持帮助军队。十五号政府动员搭汾河桥，他首先响应，回去就动员他兄弟小二和他外甥小挺、柱小，一同前去。有人来的慢些，他就说：“解放军打临汾是帮咱穷人翻身，自己给自己做活，还不起劲？”小贾村贫农赵万兴也是山东逃来的难民，他娃给地主当长工，被阎匪编了兵。他一家四口没地种，在纸厂做工，生活还顾不住，阎匪还要人口捐，一个人一年得出三石二斗粮食，出不起就挨打受骂。小贾村不足一百户，逼死打死的就有三十多家。解放军来了，赵万兴和村子里的人都积极帮助军队打仗。他们有个一致的要求：“解放了临汾，好分房分地闹翻身”。
