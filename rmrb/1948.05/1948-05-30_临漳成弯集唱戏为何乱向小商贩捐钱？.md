To the Editor:

Why is the opera performance at Chengwan Market in the fourth district of Linzhang forcibly collecting money from small business people?

On the twentieth day of the third lunar month, a Luozi opera was performed at Chengwan Market in Linzhang's fourth district. The cost of the opera was 180,000 yuan. According to reports, instead of assigning fees, village cadres and militiamen made small business people donate money to pay for the opera. Some gave 300 yuan, some 500 yuan, and everyone had to give something. If you didn't give money, you couldn't do business there. Some people had boxes of guns or handguns pressed against their backs, while others empty-handed carried account books around demanding money. A poor peasant from Beigao South Street in the second district of Wei County, who was pushing a small cart selling salt, was forced to donate 500 yuan, and they said, "If you don't give money, you can't do business." In the end, he gave 150 yuan to get by. Another person named Xu Qing, when forced to donate money, said, "I didn't watch the opera, so I won't donate to the opera price." They said, "If you don't give money, you have to leave, you can't sell here." After arguing for a while, he ended up giving 100 yuan. A total of thirteen salt sellers went from Beigao South Street in the second district of Wei County, and only one person didn't give money.

I think this is deceiving and extorting the masses. I hope that the comrades and village cadres in the relevant villages will investigate and correct this.

　　临漳成弯集唱戏为何乱向小商贩捐钱？编辑同志：
    临漳四区成弯集阴历三月二十日会上唱洛子戏，戏价十八万元，据反映不叫派款，村干民兵就让小生意人捐钱唱戏。三百的，五百的，多少都出钱。不出钱就不能在那里干买卖。有的屁股后边押着盒子枪、抵把枪等，有的空着手拿着帐本到处要钱。魏县二区北皋南街一个贫农推着小车卖盐，被逼着叫摊五百元，并说：“不出钱就不能干买卖”。最后给了百五十元才算过了关。另一个叫徐庆的，在被逼摊钱时，他说：“我没看戏，也不摊戏价”。他们说：“你不出钱就得走，不能在这里卖。”吵了一顿，结果出了一百元。魏县二区北皋南街共去了十三个卖盐的，只有一人没出钱。
    我看这是欺讹群众，望该座村同志及村干检查纠正。
