Chairman Mao's document not only instructs us on the methods for carrying out land reform, rectification, party consolidation, and democratic movements in various regions, but also, and more importantly, explains to us the general direction of the revolution today. In addition to publishing Chairman Mao's report as a separate edition in large No. 4 font, we are also printing a small-font edition for the convenience of comrades at work, with three instructions from the Central Bureau of this region attached (on the Taiyue and Taihang regions, and on industry and commerce). Every person needs to have a copy of these documents on hand.

　　毛主席在晋绥干部会上的讲话
  　大小字两种本子，读者自由选择
    毛主席这一文件，一面指示了我们在各种地区进行土改、填补、整党以及民主运动的工作方法，一面更特别强调的给我们解释了今天革命的总方针。兹除用四号大字将毛主席报告单行出版外，为了便利工作同志们参考，并另印小字本一种，内附有本区中央局的三个指示（对太岳、太行及工商业问题）。这几个文件，都是每个人手头必需置备一本的。
