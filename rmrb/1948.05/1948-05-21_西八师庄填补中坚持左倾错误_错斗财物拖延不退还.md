[Taihang News] According to reports from comrades Zhenhua, Lutian, and Chunxi, correspondents from the Fifth District of Changzhi: The villages of Xiba and Shizhuang (both villages undergoing democratic rectification and land reform) continue to cling to "leftist" errors and fail to correct them promptly, severely neglecting leadership in production. At a production work team meeting held in the district on the 10th of this month, Comrade Zhang Kairou stated: After two rounds of class division in Xiba village, it has been determined that among the 32 households previously classified as landlords and rich peasants, 19 were middle peasants wrongly classified as rich peasants during the burden review last year. Their grain was confiscated entirely; the 32 households had a total of 35,881 jin of grain confiscated, which not only covered the public grain that poor peasants should have paid but also resulted in poor peasants receiving a significant amount of grain. The household of poor peasant Song Xiulin alone received over 500 jin. However, this spring, over 200 landlords, rich peasants, and wrongly struggled middle peasants had no food to eat. The work team only led the masses to borrow over 20 shi of grain for relief, but there are still more than 30 shi of grain and a significant amount of fruit in storage. The belongings of the wrongly struggled middle peasants (such as undistributed grain and clothing) are not being returned promptly. The livestock of wrongly struggled middle peasant Shi Qi is still being used by the village cooperative for milling flour; the half-sheng wage earned by this livestock each day is also being distributed to poor and hired peasants. The work team wants to postpone rectifying the serious "leftist" errors mentioned above until after the establishment of the peasant representative assembly and the completion of class division, and then decide whether to return the wrongfully confiscated fruit to the wrongly struggled middle peasants based on the decision of the peasant representative assembly. This has severely dampened the production enthusiasm of the villagers; middle peasants are generally saying, "We'll just plant whatever, it doesn't matter." But the work team ignores this. District cadre Feng Songdou also reported that Shizhuang village is similarly persisting in "leftist" errors. He said: "The district production work team asked me to organize the village's sowing. I immediately pointed out the difficulties such as the lack of seeds for the wrongly struggled middle peasants and mobilized the cadres to solve the problem. However, the village cadres said: 'The difficulties of the basic people (poor and hired peasants) have not been completely resolved yet! Who will solve the problems for them (referring to the wrongly struggled middle peasants)?!' I discussed how to organize spring plowing and sowing with three or four comrades from the work team, including Wang ××, but they said they didn't care and told me to 'go and handle it'! They are busy summarizing the filling materials and neglecting to correct the errors against the wrongly struggled middle peasants, abandoning leadership over production. As a result, over 1,400 mu of land in the village has not yet been sown."

[Another News Item] In Su Village, First District of Lingchuan, the doors of 23 households were sealed during the first month of this year, many of which belonged to middle peasant households. Only 14 households have had their doors unsealed so far; even the door of the political director was sealed! After wrongly sealing the doors of middle peasants, their grain and farm tools were all centralized, and good land was taken away, leaving bad land for the middle peasants to cultivate; over 100 mu of good land was taken from the 23 households whose doors were sealed. The things confiscated and the good land taken when the middle peasants' doors were wrongly sealed have not been returned or compensated, which has greatly diminished the production enthusiasm of the masses, and mutual aid teams have not been organized. According to the deputy district chief, he will be going to the village soon to resolve this issue.

　　西八师庄填补中坚持左倾错误
  　错斗财物拖延不退还
    【太行消息】据长治五区通讯员振华、录田、春喜三同志报导：西八、师庄（均系进行民主整党填补村）两村，仍坚持左倾错误不马上纠正，对领导生产十分轻视。该区在本月十日召开生产工作组会议，据张开肉同志谈：西八村经过两次划阶级，已知道在过去划的三十二户地主富农中，有中农十九户，是在去年审查负担时错划为富农的；他们的粮食一律被没收；三十二户共没收粮食三万五千八百八十一斤，不但顶了贫农应缴纳的公粮，相反贫农还分得不少粮食；贫农宋秀林一户就分得五百多斤。但是地主富农和错斗中农，今春却有二百多人没饭吃；工作组只领导群众借给粮二十余石救济，可是还有三十多石粮及不少果实在存放着。错斗中农的东西（如没分散的粮、衣等），也不立即退还；错斗了中农石乞的牲口至今还被村合作社用以磨粉；这牲口每日赚的半升工资，也是分给贫雇。工作组对上述严重左倾错误，还要推到农代会成立、划好阶级，经农代会决定再退还错斗中农的果实；这样使该村群众生产情绪很低，中农普遍反映：“瞎胡种上就算啦”。但工作组也不理睬。又据区干冯松斗谈：师庄村亦同样在坚持左倾错误。他说：“区生产工作组叫我组织该村下种，我即提出错斗中农无种子等困难，动员干部解决；村干部却说：基本人（贫雇）的困难还解决不完哩！谁给他们（指错斗中农）解决？！我又给工作组王××等三四个同志商议如何组织春耕下种，人家说不管，“你去办吧”！他们忙于总结填补材料，错斗中农不纠正，放弃对生产领导，至今该村仍有一千四百多亩地没下种。”
    【又息】陵川一区苏村，在今年正月封了二十三户门，其中很多是中农户，至今仅启封了十四户；政治主任的门也被封啦！错封中农门后，将粮食农具都集中起来，并将好地抽出，留下坏地让中农种；被封门的二十三户，共抽出好地一百多亩。至今错封中农门时所没收的东西及抽出的好地均没退还或补偿，群众生产很没劲，互助组也没组织起来。据该区副区长谈：近即将到该村解决这一问题。
