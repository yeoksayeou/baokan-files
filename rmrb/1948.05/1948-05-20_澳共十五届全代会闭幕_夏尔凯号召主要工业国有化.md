Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Sydney, 12th—The 15th National Congress of the Australian Communist Party, which was recently held, has successfully concluded. In his report, Sharkey, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Australian Communist Party, pointed out that in order to defend peace, the Australian government needs to abandon its foreign policy, which it still adheres to. When talking about the domestic situation, he pointed out that the sales volume of commodities has declined due to rising prices and low wages. He said that the Labor government is trying to improve the level of industry by absorbing British and American capital. This policy will put the national economy into the hands of international capital. Sharkey called for launching a strong propaganda campaign to nationalize all major industries. The conference resolution demanded that the Australian government help end "Anglo-American interference in Greece." The conference elected Sharkey as the General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party and Dixon as the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Australian Communist Party.

　　澳共十五届全代会闭幕
  　夏尔凯号召主要工业国有化
    【新华社陕北十八日电】悉尼十二日讯：日前召开的澳共第十五届全国代表大会，已胜利闭幕。澳共执委会主席夏尔凯在报告中指出：为了保卫和平，需要澳政府放弃它至今仍奉行的外交政策。他谈到国内形势时指出：商品出售量已因物价增涨和工资低微而下降。他说：工党政府正力图以吸收英美资本来提高工业水平，这种政策将使国家经济落入国际资本之手。夏尔凯号召发起争取一切主要工业国有化的强大宣传运动。大会决议要求澳政府帮助终止“英美对希腊的干涉”。大会选出夏尔凯为澳共总书记，狄克松为澳共执委会主席。
