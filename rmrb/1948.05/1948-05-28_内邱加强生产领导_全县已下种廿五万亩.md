　　Neiqiu Strengthens Production Leadership
　　250,000 Mu Already Sown in the County
　　[Neiqiu News] Neiqiu County recently convened an expanded cadre meeting of various production work teams to review the spring plowing and production work from the 9th of last month to the 8th of this month. After a thorough rain fell last month, the County Party Committee immediately called on the people of the county to "take advantage of the time to sow early and connect early!" It also called on Party members and cadres to take the lead in helping the masses coordinate seeds, livestock, and farm tools, especially to concretely solve the difficulties of poor peasants and hired laborers who had not completely turned over their land for sowing. Through repeated publicity and explanation of the Border Government's proclamation that "whoever sows, reaps" and the County Party Committee's call, the ideological obstacles of most of the masses, such as "fear of land confiscation" and "planting cotton is okay, but planting grains is too early," were overcome. Production leadership organizations were formed from top to bottom to strengthen production leadership at all levels, set out cultivation steps, and carry out various temporary mutual aid efforts. According to reports from various districts, out of the county's 474,390 mu of cultivated land, in addition to 199,173 mu of wheat fields, there were still more than 275,000 mu. In one month, more than 200,000 mu of cotton, grains, indigo, hemp, peanuts, and other crops were sown, of which more than 30,000 mu were planted with cotton, accounting for more than 10 percent of the county's sown land. After deducting oilseed rape, vegetable plots, hyacinth beans, and other lands, there were only more than 20,000 mu of land in the county that had not been sown. In addition, according to incomplete statistics, 5,832 mu of abandoned land were eliminated throughout the county. Finally, Comrade An Shengzhang, the County Secretary, based on the actual situation in Neiqiu, put forward five agricultural requirements before the wheat harvest: (1) Seize the season and continue to complete sowing. Further eliminate abandoned land and prepare to plant miscellaneous grains and buckwheat. (2) Before the wheat harvest, mobilize the masses to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. In the new areas, prepare to fertilize the wheat stubble fields; in the old areas, top-dress the spring seedlings. In terms of fertilizer accumulation methods, mobilize the masses to cut weeds, dismantle kang (heated brick beds), and line livestock pens in large quantities, and launch a women's and children's "three-six-nine" street sweeping campaign, etc. (3) Strive to weed the spring seedlings completely before the wheat harvest, and prepare to plant wheat stubble fields in a concentrated effort after the wheat harvest. (4) Mobilize the masses to build water conservancy projects to prevent drought: twenty villages in the Third District have made plans to dig twenty wells and repair three canals. Other districts should also formulate plans based on their situations and implement them. If the projects are large and lack funds, the leadership should provide loans and food assistance. (5) Prevent insect pests and protect cotton seedlings. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to weed cotton at noon on hot days so that the strong sunlight can kill ant eggs. Prepare large quantities of red alum and seep three or four liang per mu when planting wheat stubble fields, which will kill insects and act as fertilizer. If signs of pests are found on other seedlings or trees, quickly organize the masses to capture and eliminate them. (Neiqiu Office)

　　内邱加强生产领导
  　全县已下种廿五万亩
    【内邱消息】内邱县于日前召开各生产工作组扩大干部会，检查上月九日到本月八日一月间的春耕生产工作。上月普降透雨后，县委马上号召全县群众“趁垧早种早接嘴！”并号召党员、干部带头帮助群众调剂种子、牲口、农具，特别要具体解决未翻透身的贫雇下种困难。反复宣传解释边府谁种谁收布告和县委的号召，克服了大部分群众“怕抽地”、“种棉可以，种五谷太早”等思想障碍，组成自上而下的生产领导机关，加强各级生产领导，订出耕种步骤，进行各种不同的临时互助。据各区汇报：全县四十七万四千三百九十亩耕地，除麦地十九万九千一百七十三亩外，还有二十七万五千多亩，一月间已下种棉花、五谷及靛、麻、花生等二十多万亩，其中植棉三万多亩，占全县下种地的百分之十以上。再除去油菜、菜畦、扁豆等地外，全县只有两万多亩未下种。另外据不完全统计，全县消灭熟荒五千八百三十二亩。最后县书安生长同志根据内邱实际情况，又提出麦收前五项农业要求：（一）抓紧季节，继续完成下种。进而消灭熟荒，准备种杂粮和荞麦。（二）麦收前动员群众大量积肥，新区准备上麦茬地，老区春苗上追肥。积肥方法上要大量发动群众割野草、拆炕、垫圈，发动妇女儿童三六九扫街运动等。（三）春苗争取麦前全部锄过头遍，准备麦后突击种麦茬地。（四）动员群众兴修水利，预防旱灾：三区二十个村已作出打二十眼井、修三条渠的计划，其他各区亦应根据情况订出计划，贯彻执行。如工程大，缺乏经费，领导上贷款贷粮扶助。（五）预防虫灾，保护棉苗。要发动群众热天晌午锄棉，使强烈的阳光晒死蚂蚁卵。大量准备红矾，种麦茬地时，每亩渗上三四两，一则除虫，二则顶粪。其他苗上、树上发现害虫象征，迅速组织群众捕灭。（内邱办公室）
