In East Gate of Linfen
Liu Shian

　　　　I. Airplanes Become Exhibits

Linfen is tightly surrounded by us, and there is no way out. The Chiang-Yan bandits guarding the 66th Division in the East Gate and the 30th Division defending the city are frightened and at a loss, but they have nowhere to escape. They hurriedly called in airplanes, hoping to escape from the sky, but the two airplanes that landed at the airport south of the city were captured by us before they could take off. As a result, soldiers and laborers came to visit these two airplanes, and the airplanes became exhibits. The laborers all scrambled to touch them, as if they were something mysterious. One laborer excitedly said, "I saw this victory with my own eyes."

　　　　II. Red Tonic Pills

After the 66th Division was completely wiped out by us in the East Gate, the lone figure of Liang Peihuang luckily ran into the city. Losing his helmet and armor was already disappointing enough; but he couldn't avoid being ridiculed and mocked by Hu Zongnan's 30th Division. As a result, the old fellow became even more anxious and fell ill. When the old bandit Yan Xishan heard about it, he quickly sent red tonic pills by plane to comfort him. But things didn't work out so well, and the medicine happened to fall into the hands of the People's Liberation Army.

　　在临汾东关
    刘石安
    　　　　一、飞机变成展览品
    临汾被我们包围得紧紧的，出路已经不通了。蒋阎匪把守东关的六十六师与守城的三十师吓得惊惶失措，但他们入地无门，连忙叫来飞机想从天空逃跑，但落在城南机场的两架飞机，还没来得及飞起来，就被我捉住了。于是军队、民工都来参观这两架飞机，飞机变成了展览品。民夫们都争着用手去摸摸，好象有啥神秘似的。一个民夫兴奋的说：“这个胜利我可亲眼看到了。”
    　　　　二、红色补丸
    六十六师被我们在东关全部消灭之后，光杆的梁培璜侥幸的跑进城里，本来丢盔弃甲，已够败兴；却又不免被胡宗南的三十师奚落嘲笑。于是老家伙益发着急，就闹起病来。阎锡山老贼听说，赶快用飞机给他运送红色补丸，以示安慰。但事情又不凑巧，偏偏这药品又落到解放军的阵地上了。
