    【Taiyue News】Some cadres in the Fifth District of Qinshui are perfunctory in correcting "leftist" deviations and do not act in accordance with policies. For example, in Hudi Village, last winter, they forced middle peasants to pool shares, imposed unfair burdens, and controlled middle peasants, infringing upon their interests and causing unrest in the entire village. Although one-third of the millet has been planted now, it was planted haphazardly. When Comrade Wang Dianzhong went to work in this village, he did not first correct the deviations, but only mobilized production. Some middle peasants raised the issues of last year. Xin Zhongnong (new middle peasant) Che Manzhong said, "When I was placed under control last year, I blamed Mian Zhu (standing committee member of the Farmers' Association)." Mi Zhu said, "When mobilizing for contributions last year, Mian Zhu put his hand in the cloth bag and insisted that I pay, saying I was an old middle peasant, and confiscated some of my shares." The seventeen middle peasant households that were harmed all raised objections. However, Comrade Wang Dianzhong not only did not resolve them on the spot, but instead let the village head speak, explaining that he had to go on a business trip the next day, shifting the focus. The next day, the middle peasants prepared to resolve these issues, but Wang Dianzhong, seeing the situation was not good, did not let Mian Zhu participate, and himself returned to the district. Another example is Yu Xi Village, where they wrongly sealed the door of middle peasant Wang Shuanniu. Comrade Yuan Juxiang went there to correct this, wanting to open the door for Shuanniu. The masses were originally willing, but because the militia committee director Diao Ruanzhen strongly opposed it, and even incited some poor peasants to eat Shuanniu's grain (one stone and six dou and five sheng of wheat, seven dou and eight sheng of beans), Yuan Juxiang also explained, but Diao Ruanzhen still resisted, saying: "Anyway, now it's putting a big hat on the hired poor, in the past you said the hired poor wouldn't rise up; now that they have risen up, you want to open the door, and speak well of them, I can't understand this thinking." Yuan Juxiang did not persuade and criticize Diao Ruanzhen's resistant thinking, and played tail, and did not act in accordance with policies. Although the door was opened, the property was registered and not allowed to be moved, and the family of six had nothing to eat, and no one cared.

    沁水区干王殿忠到村
    只谈生产不提纠偏
    【太岳消息】沁水五区有些干部在纠正左倾偏向中，马马虎虎，不按政策办事。如胡底村，去冬强迫中农集股、负担不公、管制中农等，侵犯了中农利益，弄得全村不安。现在虽种了三分之一的谷，也是瞎胡种上的。王殿忠同志到这村工作时，不先纠正偏向，光来动员生产。有些中农就提出去年的事。新中农车满中说：“年时管制我就是怨棉柱（农会常委）的过。”米珠说：“年时动员款时，棉柱把手插在布袋，非叫我出钱不行，说我是旧中农，没收了我些股金。”被伤害的十七家中农，都提了意见。但王殿忠同志不但不当场解决，反而让闾长出来说话，说明天要出差，转移了目标。第二天中农准备解决这些问题，王殿忠见势不好，没有让棉柱参加，自己也回到区上了。又如玉溪村错封了中农王拴牛的门，原聚祥同志去那里纠正，要给拴牛开门，群众原来都愿意，但因为武委会主任刁软针一股劲反对，还鼓动一部分贫农要吃拴牛的粮食（一石六斗五升麦子、七斗八升豆），原聚祥也解释了，可是刁软针还是抵抗说：“反正现在是给雇贫戴上大帽了，过去雇贫不起来你们说不起来；现在起来了，你们又叫开门，给人家说好话，我这思想就不通。”原聚祥没有把刁软针的这种抵抗思想给予说服批评，当了尾巴，就不按政策办事。虽开了门，但把财产登记了不许动，人家一家六口人也没吃的也不管。
