　　(Jilu Yu [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region] News, 22nd) After Puyang's masses busily finished planting sorghum, on April 23rd, 4,250 strong laborers (mostly volunteers) participated in the dike restoration work. In the course of restoring the dike, the masses demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm for self-salvation. Ji Zai Shan, a worker from Han Village in the Fourth District, pushed earth with his back bare; blisters formed on his shoulders, yet he refused to rest. Eight people from his village pushed earth, completing 284 cubic meters of earth in eight days, averaging 4.73 cubic meters per person per day. Wu Baozhen, from West Wu Village, led the dike restoration masses in his village to start work before dawn; by daybreak, they had already pushed fourteen cartloads of earth. Thanks to the active efforts of the dike restoration masses, the task of completing 98,448 cubic meters of earth was completed in fifteen days; but when we were restoring the dike, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits actively carried out obstruction and sabotage. In fifteen days, Chiang Kai-shek's airplanes disrupted, bombed, and strafed our dike restoration personnel twenty-one times. Airplanes attacked almost every day. On the 24th alone, there were four airplanes that attacked three times. If our dike restoration workers were slow to take cover and were discovered by the enemy, they would immediately be strafed and bombed. Chiang Kai-shek's army, Mi Wenhe's troops, shelled and strafed our dike restoration personnel from across the river at Li Bridge, injuring three of our personnel on May 8th. Whenever enemy planes passed or the shelling stopped, the dike restoration workers immediately emerged from the air-raid shelters to continue working.

　　冒着蒋匪炮击扫射
  　濮阳四千群众奋勇复堤自救
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】濮阳群众忙着耩完高粱后，于四月二十三日有四千二百五十名壮丁（大部是自报奋勇参加的）参加复堤工作。在复堤中，群众表现了高度的自救热情。四区韩庄的工人计在山，光着脊梁推土，膀子上磨起了泡还不肯歇歇，他村八个人推土，在八天内完成了二百八十四方土，每人一天合土四方七分三。西吴庄的吴宝珍，领导着本村复堤群众早晨天不明就上工了，等天明时就推了十四车子土。由于复堤群众的积极努力，所以在十五天内就完成了九万八千四百四十八方土的任务；但我复堤时，蒋匪曾积极的进行阻扰和破坏，十五天中蒋匪飞机共扰乱轰炸扫射我复堤人员二十一次，每日均有飞机来袭，二十四日一天内即有四架飞机来袭三次。如我复堤民工隐蔽稍一迟慢为敌发现，即行扫射轰炸。蒋匪军米文和部曾在我李桥对岸炮击与扫射我复堤人员，五月八日击伤我方三人。每当敌机一过或炮击停止时，复堤员工马上就从防空洞里钻出来继续工作。
