The Struggle of the Burmese People

(I)
　　Burma is a neighboring country to China's southwest. It has an area of 680,000 square kilometers and a population of 17 million, of which Burmese people account for six-fifths, in addition to Karen, Shan, Chin, and Kachin ethnic minorities. Among this population of 17 million, more than 80 percent are farmers.
　　Burma is one of the most prosperous countries in Southeast Asia; it is the world's number one producer of gemstones; the second largest producer of silver; and its annual tungsten production accounts for one-sixth of the world's total. At the same time, Burma is a major rice-producing area in the world, with rice exports accounting for 45 percent of the world's total. In addition, teak and other forest products are particularly famous, with an annual output of approximately 800,000 tons.
　　This fertile and resource-rich territory has been a colony of British imperialism for fifty to sixty years. For the past fifty to sixty years, imperialism has relied on its violent rule, utilizing local cheap raw materials and labor to extract huge profits. However, millions of Burmese people have become increasingly impoverished. Of the total population, 75 percent are rural serfs in disguise, and 11 percent are urban factory workers and their reserve army. Farmers toil diligently throughout the seasons, but 60 percent of their harvest must be offered to landlords, and they also bear heavy additional taxes. Workers labor for ten or more hours a day, earning only 50 kyats per month (in 1946, the Burmese Communist Party decided to demand a minimum wage of 160 kyats). Even public servants earn salaries that are less than one-thirtieth of those of British employees, averaging between 50 and 90 kyats, which is not enough to maintain their personal lives.
　　During World War II, British imperialism made many beautiful promises. However, to this day, Burma still preserves all the typical characteristics of imperialist exploitation of colonies. Foreign capital (mainly British) controls the entire Burmese economy; all large enterprises are owned by the British; and British shares also dominate major trades such as rice, timber, and cotton. Burma has virtually no national industry of its own, and all manufactured goods must rely on imports. Imperialism colludes with comprador classes, feudal princes, and large monks and other feudal forces to carry out its colonial rule and exploitation.

(II)
　　Since Britain invaded Burma, turning it into a province of India and implementing its imperialist rule, the Burmese people have been unwilling to accept oppression from foreign nations, and have resisted in various ways. National independence movements have surged up in various places, never ceasing.
　　After World War I, the Burmese people's struggle for liberation became particularly active. Anti-British riots broke out in rural areas and some large factories. Around 1930, there were already struggles led by the Communist Party to resist rent and taxes among farmers, and strike struggles by industrial workers. The fierce development of anti-British riots by workers and peasants caused great alarm to British imperialism, and the House of Commons passed the Government of India Act in 1935, and implemented "separation of India and Burma" in 1937. After the separation, the Burmese people's struggle continued to develop. In order to resist British imperialism's control over Burma's "exclusive resources," a large-scale general strike broke out in 1938.
　　When the Pacific War broke out and Japanese imperialism invaded the south, the Burmese Communist Party led armed farmers in various rural areas, persisted in guerrilla warfare, and organized Aung San, the commander-in-chief of the puppet army, to revolt in March 1945, cooperating with the Allied forces to counterattack and expel the Japanese invaders.

(III)
　　When the anti-fascist war ended victoriously, the Burmese people's strength in striving for independence and liberation grew unprecedentedly. The Burmese Communist Party united the working class, peasantry, and petty bourgeoisie to establish a national united front, forming the "Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League," with membership rapidly developing to more than 200,000. It also established a "National Army," with a force of 20,000 to 30,000. The people conducted a more organized and larger-scale struggle in a new posture. This struggle developed into a high tide of national liberation movement in August 1946.
　　However, at this time, because the Communist Party did not grasp the leadership over the bourgeoisie in the united front, because of insufficient determination and perseverance in organizing armed struggle, because of the lack of heroic leadership and a clear program, and because of the British imperialism's division of the united front, the upper-level right-wing elements such as the Aung San reactionary group betrayed the revolution, and the victorious advance of the revolution temporarily suffered a setback.

(IV)
　　When British imperialism returned to Burma in October 1945, the Burmese people who appeared before it were clearly different. Their political awareness had greatly improved, and their organizational strength and struggle experience were unprecedentedly rich. They were no longer willing to live in the same old way. The rulers of the suzerain state could only adopt new ruling methods to maintain their rule.
　　The methods used by British imperialists in Burma were nothing more than division and buying-off, political conspiracies, and, in the final form, handing over administrative power to some puppet traitors, calling it "independence" to deceive the people.
　　After British Governor-General Rance took office in Burma, his first step was to seduce Aung San to serve as "Deputy Prime Minister" (the Prime Minister was the Burmese Governor). From then on, the Aung San group betrayed the Freedom League. In January 1946, at a mass rally of ten thousand people by the Great Lake in Yangon, the resolution to demand independence and the establishment of a democratic united government was betrayed, as well as the motherland and the people. The result of Aung San's compromise was, first of all, the disbandment of the people's armed forces, followed by the arrest of workers and peasant association leaders and the Burmese Communist leader Thakin Soe (who was later released due to mass protests), the expulsion of the Burmese Communist Party from the "Freedom League," and attacks on the Burmese Communist armed forces. The reactionary countercurrent was rampant for a while. However, the people's resistance to the reactionary rule also rose sharply. In rural areas, fierce struggles unfolded in the form of resisting rent and taxes, even armed popular uprisings, and in cities in the form of strikes and demonstrations. In particular, the general strike in January 1947 paralyzed the entire Burmese ruling structure, and the threat of an army uprising made Aung San panic.
　　Under the high pressure of the masses, imperialism, fearing that the fragile Aung San group would be intimidated by the power of the people, made concessions to the people. Thus, on July 19, 1947, it conspired to cause the "Aung San and seven others incident." When the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked. After the traitor Aung San completed a certain task, imperialism ended his dog's life in this way!
　　After Aung San was killed, Attlee immediately announced that the policy towards Burma would remain unchanged. Immediately, another running dog, Tekin Nu, was brought out from the upper-level reactionary elements of the Freedom League. In October 1947, Tekin Nu and Attlee signed the "Burma Independence Act and the Anglo-Burmese Treaty." On January 6, 1948, Burma was declared "independent" in accordance with this treaty.

(V)
　　The reality in Burma is a ruthless mockery of the so-called "independence" of imperialism. Whether from an economic, military, or political perspective, Burma's status has not changed. Burma remains a typical colony.
　　Economically speaking, Britain has not withdrawn from Burma. According to the Attlee-Tekin Nu Agreement, the Burmese people are not allowed to touch British commercial interests in Burma. British capital still monopolizes the economic lifeline of the country.
　　Militarily speaking, the Attlee-Tekin Nu Agreement does not clearly stipulate the date of British troop withdrawal. Moreover, Ba Din, the secretary of the Burmese puppet Ministry of Defense, once told a Reuters reporter: "In order to train the new army, the existing British Indian army (note: 6,000 in 1946) will remain for at least two or three years, and the military expenses will be borne by Burma."
　　What the Attlee-Tekin Nu Agreement clearly stipulates is that Burma can only accept military assistance from Britain, and cannot accept military assistance from any other country (including training and equipment, etc.); British military aircraft can fly in Burmese airspace; in wartime, British armed forces can pass through Burma or enter Burmese territory... and other military clauses that completely control Burma.
　　Politically speaking, imperialism is simply handing over power to its loyal servants - the reactionary group of Burmese landlords and compradores. Through them, it maintains British interests in Burma and continues its precarious colonial rule.
　　The first president of Burma after "independence," Sao Shwe Thaik himself, is a feudal overlord - a Shan chieftain. Prime Minister Tekin Nu was the puppet foreign minister during the Japanese occupation - a vicious and notorious Burmese traitor. A government headed by these people will not have any other role than to execute the orders of imperialism and intensify the oppression and exploitation of the broad masses of the people.

(VI)
　　The bloody reality since the puppet government came to power has educated the Burmese people. Their ideal of demanding independence and freedom has not been realized. In order to break free from the shackles of imperialism, they are continuing a more heroic and fiercer battle!
　　Since the representatives of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie - the Aung San Tekin Nu group - betrayed their friends who once helped them - the Communist Party, workers, peasants, and other small and medium-sized bourgeoisie; betrayed the Burmese national liberation movement; and became enemies of the Burmese people, the Burmese national liberation movement has entered a new stage.
　　At this time, the Burmese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle for freedom and liberation is under the sole leadership of the Communist Party, with armed struggle as the main form of struggle, and is developing vigorously in the countryside. The ruling class once dispatched 5,000 troops to suppress the people's armed forces, and British imperialist planes provided assistance, but the people's armed forces were not only not eliminated, but also grew stronger day by day. They have already established democratic base areas in Tangoo, Pinbyin, Yamethin in central Burma and Arakan in northern Burma. The Vanguard newspaper reported that the peasant armed forces have various new weapons. Burmese official newspapers have also openly admitted that the Communist Party's power has developed unprecedentedly in rural areas, and has gained the sympathy of some police and Indian troops.
　　The position of British imperialism is crumbling, and the strength of the Burmese people is on the rise. The Burmese people, united as one, will finally destroy all imperialist and feudal forces through their indomitable and heroic struggle, and establish a new, independent, and free Burmese People's Republic in Southeast Asia.

　　缅甸人民的抗争
    （一）
    缅甸是我国西南端的一个邻邦。面积六十八万平方公里，人口一千七百万，缅甸人占六分之五，此外还有喀伦、掸、清、喀钦等少数民族。在这一千七百万人口中，百分之八十以上为农民。
    缅甸是东南亚一个最富庶的国家；是全世界第一宝石产地；第二个产银国；每年钨的产量占世界总额的六分之一。同时，缅甸又是世界主要米粮出产地，米的出口占全世界米粮总额百分之四十五。此外，特别有名的是楠木等林产，年产约八十万吨。
    这片田地肥沃、特产丰富的领土，沦为英帝国主义的殖民地已经五六十年了。五六十年来，帝国主义凭借其暴力统治，利用当地的廉价原料与劳力，榨取了巨额利润。可是千百万缅甸人民却日益赤贫化。在总人口中，百分之七十五为农村变相农奴，百分之十一为城市工厂劳动者及其后备军。农民四季辛勤耕作，收成的百分之六十必须奉献给地主，而且还担负沉重的附加税。工人每天劳动十来小时，每月所得工资只有五十盾（一九四六年缅共决定要求最低工资为一百六十盾）。就是公教人员，他们的薪金不及英籍职员的三十分之一，平均在五十盾至九十盾之间，还不够维持个人的生活。
    第二次世界大战期间，英帝国主义曾经发出许多漂亮诺言。然而，时至今日，缅甸依然原封未动地保存着帝国主义剥削殖民地的一切典型特征。外国资本（主要是英国）控制了缅甸整个经济；一切大企业都是英国人所有；在米、木材、棉花、运输等主要贸易中，英国股份亦占绝对优势。缅甸实际上没有自己的民族工业，一切制成商品都要依靠进口。帝国主义勾结买办阶级、土邦王公、大僧侣等封建势力，进行其殖民地的统治和榨取。
    （二）
    自从英国侵夺缅甸，并为印度一省，实行其帝国主义统治以来。缅甸人民不愿外来民族的压迫，采用种种方式进行反抗。各地掀起的民族独立运动，此伏彼起，一直未曾停歇过。
    第一次世界大战后，缅甸人民的解放斗争尤形活跃。农村及若干大工厂都展开了反英暴动。一九三○年前后，即有了共产党领导的农民抗租抗税的斗争，产业工人的罢工斗争。全属工农群众反英暴动的猛烈开展，使英国帝国主义惊恐万状，下院遂于一九三五年通过印度政府法案，一九三七年实行“印缅分治”。分治以后，缅甸人民的斗争继续往前发展，为了拒抗英帝国主义对于缅甸“资源独占”的管制，于一九三八年爆发了声势浩大的总罢工。
    太平洋战争爆发，日本帝国主义南侵，缅甸共产党便在农村里领导各地农民武装，坚持游击战争，并且组织伪军总司令昂山于一九四五年三月反正，配合盟军反攻，驱逐日寇。
    （三）
    反法西斯战争胜利结束时，缅甸人民争取独立解放的力量空前增长。缅共联合工农阶级、中小资产阶级建立民族统一阵线，组成“反法西斯人民自由同盟”，盟员迅速发展达二十余万。并且建立“民族军”，兵力二、三万人。人民以崭新的姿态进行更有组织、更大规模的斗争，这一斗争，一直发展到一九四六年八月呈现着民族解放运动的高潮。
    可是，在这时候，由于共产党没有在统一阵线当中掌握对于资产阶级的领导权，由于组织武装斗争的决心与毅力不足，由于没有英勇的领导与明确的纲领，加上英帝国主义对于统一阵线的分化，上层右冀分子昂山等反动集团叛变了，革命的胜利进军暂时遭受了挫折。
    （四）
    一九四五年十月英帝国主义回到缅甸的时候，出现在它面前的缅甸人民已经显然不同了。他们的政治觉悟大大提高，组织力量与斗争经验也空前的丰富了。他们已经不愿再照旧的方式生活下去。宗主国统治者也只有采取新的统治手法，才能维持它的统治。
    英帝国主义者在缅甸所使用的手法，不外分化收买、政治阴谋及最后形式上把行政权交给一些傀儡卖国贼，美其名为“独立”等骗术。
    英驻缅总督兰斯赴任后，首先便是勾引昂山出任“副总理”（总理即缅督）。自此以后，昂山集团便背叛了自由同盟。一九四六年一月在仰光大湖边万人大会上，要求独立建立民主联合政府的决议，出卖了祖国和人民。昂山妥协的结果，首先便是人民武装被解散，接着逮捕工人农会领袖及缅共领袖德钦索（后由于群众抗议而释放），把缅共开除出“自由同盟”，进攻缅共武装等等。反动逆流猖獗一时。然而，人民对反动统治的抗争也跟着激剧上涨。农村里以抗租抗税，甚至武装民变的形式，城市里则以罢工、示威等形式展开勇猛斗争。特别是一九四七年一月的大罢工，使整个缅甸统治机构陷于麻痹状态，而军队准备起义的威协更使昂山惊惶失措。
    在群众的高压下，帝国主义畏恐脆弱的昂山集团震慑于人民的威力，向人民作出让步。于是，便在一九四七年七月十九日，阴谋促成了昂山等七人的“惨案”。狡兔死走狗烹，帝国主义在卖国贼昂山完成了一定任务之后，就这样把他结束了狗命！
    昂山被杀后，艾总礼立刻宣布对缅政策不变。随即从自由同盟上层反动分子中抬出另一个走狗——德钦努。一九四七年十月，德钦努与艾德礼签订了“缅甸独立法案与英缅条约”。一九四八年一月六日依此条约宣布缅甸“独立”。
    （五）
    缅甸的现实对于帝国主义的所谓“独立”是一个无情的嘲笑。不管从经济、军事、政治方面看，缅甸的地位依然没有改变。缅甸仍然是一个典型的殖民地。
    从经济来说，英国并没有撤出缅甸。根据艾德礼——德钦努协定，英国在缅甸的商业利益，缅甸人是动不得的。英国资本照样垄断着全国经济命脉。
    从军事说，艾德礼——德钦努协定对英军撤退的日期并无明确规定。而且缅甸伪国防部秘书巴鼎曾告路透社记者说：“为训练新军起见，现有英印军（按：一九四六年为六千人），至少将留驻二三年，其军费由缅甸负担”。
    艾德礼——德钦努协定明确规定的是：缅甸只能接受英国的，而不能接受任何一个国家的军事援助（包括训练装备等）；英国军用飞机得在缅甸领空飞行；战时英国武装部队得假道缅甸或进入缅境………等等军事上完全控制缅甸的条款。
    从政治来说，帝国主义不过是把政权交给他的忠实从仆——缅甸大地主大买办反动集团。经由他们来保持英国在缅甸的权益与继续它岌岌可危的殖民地统治。
    缅甸“独立”后的首届总统萧泰瑞克本人，就是一个封建大领主——掸族酋长。总理德钦努是日军占领期间的伪外长——一个穷凶极恶、臭名昭著的大缅奸。以这些人为首的政府，除了执行帝国主义的命令，加紧压迫、剥削广大人民群众之外，不会有别的什么作用。
    （六）
    傀儡政府登台以来的血淋淋现实教育了缅甸人民。他们要求独立自由的理想并没有实现。为了挣脱帝国主义的枷锁，他们在继续更英勇、更激烈的战斗！
    自从大地主大资产阶级的代表——昂山德钦努集团背叛了曾经援助他们的朋友——共产党、工人、农民及其他中小资产阶级；背叛了缅甸民族解放运动；变成了缅甸人民公敌以后，缅甸的民族解放运动便进入了一个新阶段。
    这时候，缅甸人民争取自由解放的反帝反封建斗争，是在共产党单独领导下，以武装斗争为主要斗争形式，在农村里蓬勃展开了。统治阶级曾经出动五千部队要剿灭人民武装，并有英帝国主义的飞机为之助威，可是，人民武装非但没有被消灭，而且日益壮大了。他们已经在缅甸中部的倘哥、平变、雅默生及缅北的阿拉干等地区建立了民主根据地。前锋报称：农民武装有各种新式武器。缅甸官方报纸亦公开承认：共产党势力已在农村中空前发展，而且得到部分警察与印度军的同情。
    英帝国主义的地位正摇摇欲坠，缅甸人民的力量则方兴未艾。缅甸人民团结一致，不屈不挠的英勇斗争必将最后摧毁一切帝国主义与封建势力，在东南亚建立一个新的、独立、自由的缅甸人民共和国。
