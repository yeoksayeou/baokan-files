(From our front lines in Southern Shanxi, 23rd) The people of Southern Shanxi longed for the liberation of Linfen like a drought-stricken land longs for rain. Even before the People's Liberation Army (PLA) arrived, the masses from dozens of counties transported supplies and firewood to the villages ahead. The people of Houma and Jia counties had been asking, "When will the Eighth Route Army come?" They were preparing every day for how to welcome the PLA. When the masses in Dongzhoubi saw the troops coming, they automatically brought pot after pot of boiled water to the soldiers without waiting for village instructions. As soon as the troops arrived in Nanchiao village, old lady Zhu cleaned her house thoroughly and offered it to the army to stay in. When the PLA insisted on staying in a small shed, old lady Zhu said anxiously, "If you hadn't come, we wouldn't have been able to live peacefully at home for a single day. Now that you've come to save us, what does it matter if you stay in the house!" After troops were stationed in Nanxi village, the masses immediately held a joint army-civilian celebration to express their gratitude. They said excitedly, "We've been waiting eleven years for this day. Now that you're stationed here, you can have anything you need. We don't even need to sleep." After the meeting, the masses planned to grind the flour finer and wash clothes and mend quilts for the army. On March 18th, the masses of Xiaocheng village, two miles from Chengguan, heard that the troops were about to enter the position to attack Dongguan. They immediately held a grand meeting to see them off. Amidst the sounds of drums and music, they presented the troops with several large red banners that read "Glorious Ascent of the City" and gave five hundred bright red strips of cloth embroidered with "Glorious Ascent of the City" and "Eliminate Evil for the People" to be draped across the chests of the soldiers. While the people were draping the red cloth strips on the soldiers, they said, "Comrades, the stubborn enemies have harmed us so much that we have nothing left. We can't afford to buy good things to give you, so we're giving you this little something to show our hearts." The soldiers were so moved that they said, "We will definitely take Linfen," "We won't come back if we don't take Linfen."

　　攻克临汾战役中
  　晋南人民欢迎解放军
  　烧水打扫房屋热情招待
    【本报晋南前线二十三日电】晋南人民渴望解放临汾如同天旱望雨。当解放军未到前，数十个县的群众就纷纷向前方的村庄运送给养、柴草。对侯、贾得群众早就打听着：“八路军啥时才能来？”每天都在准备着如何欢迎解放军。东周壁的群众看到部队过来，不等村中通知，就自动把开水一盆一盆送到战士面前；部队刚到南桥村，朱老太太就把自己的房子扫得干干净净的让给军队驻。解放军硬要住到小棚内，朱老太太着急的说：“你们不来，我们不能在家安生一天，现在你们开来救咱，住一住房子还算个啥！”南席村驻扎军队后，群众马上召开军民联欢会进行慰劳，他们兴奋的说：“十一年了，盼到今天，你们驻到这里，要什有什，我们不睡觉都行。”会后，群众酝酿着要把面磨细，要给军队洗衣拆被。三月十八号，距城关二里的小程村的群众听说部队就要进入阵地攻打东关，立刻开大会欢送，在鼓乐喧天中，献给部队“登城光荣”等大幅红旗子数面，并赠给五百个“登城光荣”、“为民除害”的鲜红布条披带于战士胸前。老百姓一边给战士披带红布条，一边这样说：“同志，顽固把咱们害的什么都没有了，买不起好东西相送，就送这一点东西表示表示咱们一颗心。”战士都被感动得纷纷表示说：“一定拿下临汾城”，“打不下临汾我们不回来”。
