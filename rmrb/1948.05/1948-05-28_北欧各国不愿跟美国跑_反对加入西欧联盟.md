Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The "Labor Daily" here recently published an article entitled "Scandinavian People Oppose Joining the Western European Union," stating that the propaganda in favor of the Nordic countries joining the Western European Union, carried out under foreign instigation, has been opposed by the broad masses of the people. Those who promote this argument in Sweden and Denmark have now found themselves isolated. The warmongers in Norway are also gradually losing ground. The article stated that only the most reactionary groups support including the Nordic countries in the Western European Union plan. In Norway, those who support the Western military alliance are shipowners and bankers who have close ties with Wall Street and British financial oligarchs, as well as the Labor Party leaders they have bought off. In Sweden, the leaders of this movement are senior military figures and the Wallenberg financial dynasty, which has close ties with Wall Street, as well as the Bonnier publishing, paper, and fiber companies; however, the broad masses of the Swedish people resolutely oppose abandoning the policy of international cooperation. When Swedish Finance Minister Wigforss exposed the goals pursued by those who advocate Sweden joining the Western European Union, he pointed out: "We do not want to understand the views promoted by the militarists, that the East is drafting an anti-Scandinavian plan, because it is more likely that the West is trying to establish its base in the Nordic countries to carry out aggression. Obviously, if such a base is given to the West, it will put them in a war danger zone." Considering the mood of the masses, the responsible authorities in Denmark also oppose the alliance policy. Danish Prime Minister Hedtoft proclaimed in his May Day speech: "We oppose dividing the world into two major blocs." Only Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange is opposed to this, he declared: "Significant reasons may force us to choose a path that separates us from Denmark and Sweden." The "Labor Daily" pointed out that this so-called "reason" is the secret negotiations currently being conducted by Washington with Gunnar Jahn, manager of the Norwegian National Bank, and Brenn, a representative of the Ministry of Defense, which plan to use Norwegian ships to transport Marshall Plan deliveries, in exchange for Norway's participation in the Western European military alliance. However, the war propaganda carried out by the reactionaries for this purpose has been criticized by Norwegian public opinion. "Friheten" (Freedom) newspaper stated: "To propagate that the United States is prepared to protect us against the imaginary 'Soviet plan' is not only an insult to friendly countries, it is simply an insult to the Norwegian people who have lived in friendship and peace with the great Russian people for thousands of years."

　　北欧各国不愿跟美国跑
  　反对加入西欧联盟
    【新华社陕北廿四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：此间劳动报顷刊载“斯堪的纳维亚人民反对加入西欧联盟”一文内称：在外国唆使下进行赞成北欧各国加入西欧联盟的宣传，业已受到广大人民的反对。在瑞典和丹麦宣传这种论调的人们，现已发觉他们处于孤立。挪威的战争贩子们同样也渐感失势。该文称：只有最反动的集团，才赞成把北欧各国列入西欧联盟计划中。在挪威拥护西方军事联盟的，是和华尔街及英国财政寡头有密切联系的船主与银行家，以及他们所收买的工党领袖。在瑞典这一运动的领导者，是高级军方人士和与华尔街有密切联系的瓦伦堡金融王朝，以及彭奈尔斯出版、造纸、纤维公司；可是广大的瑞典人民坚决反对放弃国际合作政策。瑞典财长维福尔斯揭露那些主张瑞典加入西欧联盟的人们所追求的目的时指称：“我们不想去了解军国主义者所宣传的观点，但什么东方正在拟订反斯堪的纳维亚的计划因为更其可能的，倒似乎是西方力图在北欧各国建立其基地，以实行侵略。很明显的，如果将这样的基地给予西方，则将使他们处于战争危险地区。”考虑到群众的情绪，丹麦的负责当局也反对联盟政策。丹总理赫多夫在其五一演说中宣传：“我们反对把世界分成两大集团”。只有挪威外长兰基与此相反，他宣称：“重大的缘由，可能迫使我们选择那使我们远离丹、瑞的道路。”劳动报指出：这一所谓“缘由”，就是华盛顿现正与挪威国家银行经理根纳江及国防部代表勃伦所进行的秘密谈判，该谈判拟由挪威船只来运输马歇尔计划的交付品，而以挪威参加西欧军事联盟为交换条件。可是，反动派为此进行的战争宣传，却遭到了挪威舆论界的抨击。佛列赫顿报称：“宣传美国准备保护我们，抵抗想象中的‘苏联计划’，这不只是侮辱友邦，这简直是侮辱数千年来就与伟大俄国人民友好和平相处的挪威人民。”
