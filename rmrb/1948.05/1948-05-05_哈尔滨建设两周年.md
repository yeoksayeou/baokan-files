Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd: Since the People's Liberation Army entered Harbin on April 28, 1946, over the past two years, with the development of the overall situation in the Northeast, and through the arduous exploration process and the joint efforts of the democratic government and people from all walks of life in the city, Harbin's role in the Northeast Liberated Area has been growing. It has become the heart of all the people in the Northeast. It has achieved considerable success in supporting the front, industry and commerce, culture and education, and municipal construction, making the people's city increasingly stable and prosperous, and laying the foundation for further development, so as to more powerfully support the large-scale war and complete the glorious historical task of liberating the entire Northeast. This great achievement is particularly closely related to the awakening and creativity of the working people and relying on the masses to mobilize the masses. The following is a summary of Harbin's municipal construction in the past two years:

In terms of supporting the front: Since the establishment of the democratic government, more than 21,500 people have poured into the People's Liberation Army in the upsurge of joining the army. In the past battles and offensives, a total of more than 7,000 civilian workers, more than 2,000 horse-drawn carts, more than 500 car drivers, and more than 1,000 doctors and nurses served the front line. In the last military comfort campaign alone, 230,000 pairs of military shoes were raised and sent to the front. These achievements clearly demonstrate that the 800,000 people of Harbin are fighting alongside the soldiers at the front.

In terms of industry and commerce: After continuous exploration and correction in policy, since resolutely implementing the policy of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, significant developments have been achieved. According to statistics in February 1946, there were only 2,784 industrial households and 3,563 commercial households in the city. According to statistics in February this year, the number of industrial households has increased to 12,631, an increase of about five times, and the number of commercial households has increased to 9,951, an increase of about three times. Moreover, since the city government promulgated two laws protecting industry and commerce this spring, in just over two months, 1,537 new industrial households and 491 commercial households have been opened in the city. In order to further develop industry, the city government issued 300 million Northeast circulation notes (equivalent to 150 billion in Chiang Kai-shek's legal tender) as industrial loans a month ago. At the same time, in order to encourage urban capitalists to invest in agriculture and animal husbandry, it has assisted more than ten companies such as Xingdong Company in investing. There are also 72 cooperatives in various districts of the city, organizing more than 30,000 women to engage in textile industry. In order to ensure the supply of grain and other necessities for 800,000 citizens and solve the production difficulties of urban poor people, the government vigorously assisted more than 31,000 people in going to the countryside to engage in agricultural production. In terms of taxation, in order to reduce the burden on the people and promote the development of industry and commerce, the democratic government only stipulated eleven types of taxes (there were forty-three types during the puppet Manchurian regime), and some tax items are still being reduced.

In terms of national education: It is proposed to popularize education and strive for the enrollment of the largest number of school-age children. For example, most primary school grades one and two adopt the two-part system of morning and afternoon, which facilitates poor children to take time out of their labor to attend school. In the past two years, primary school education has greatly exceeded the era of the puppet Manchurian regime and Chiang Kai-shek's rule. In 1946, there were 87 primary schools with 34,283 students, accounting for 30% of the city's school-age children. In 1947, the number of primary schools in the city increased to 139, plus private schools, kindergartens, and private schools, the total number of children enrolled in the city was 41,571, accounting for 36% of the city's school-age children. This year, it has further increased to 168 primary schools, 19 private primary schools, 11 kindergartens, and 23 private schools. The total number of children enrolled in the city is 52,667, accounting for 46% of the city's school-age children. The number of schools and students has increased more than three times compared with the puppet Manchurian regime in 1941. There are currently 1,323 teachers and staff, more than double the 437 in 1941. According to the government's announcement, the future policy will make national education more popular, so that all children in the city have the opportunity to study, and improve the curriculum and teaching methods on the existing basis, so that it gradually completely adapts to the teaching policy of new democracy, and at the same time, it will support private schools as much as possible without violating the new education policy. In terms of secondary education, a large number of new intellectuals and cadres have been trained, and poor students and children of workers have been absorbed, and workers' middle schools and other vocational schools have been established. Other schools also have free places and special training classes to facilitate the enrollment of workers and children of poor farmers. In total, the current six middle schools in the city have more than 4,000 students, an increase of nearly 1,000 compared with the puppet Manchurian era. From last year to February of this year, 1,304 students from various middle schools were introduced to work in various departments, and nearly 1,000 people participated in other professions and were admitted to general cadre schools. The future policy of secondary education is to combine culture with reality, widely absorb the children of the working people, and combine investigation, research, experimentation, and collective cooperation in teaching.

In terms of municipal construction: In the past two years, 54 projects such as bridges, roads, rivers, and underpasses have been built, and a total of 127 projects such as new and renovated schools, hospitals, parks, nurseries, memorial halls, and memorial towers have been built. After two competitions and production meritorious service campaigns, municipal enterprises have taken a step forward. The Electric Power Bureau and the Telephone and Telegraph Bureau have ensured the city's power, lighting, and communication needs. The water plant supplies water all day long, with a daily volume of 15,000 tons, and has installed electrical water purification equipment and sorted out the city's underpasses (55,600 households). By the "May 1st" Labor Day, the tram factory was running 30 trams every day, more than double the puppet Manchurian era, with about 80,000 passengers per day, more than one-third more than the puppet Manchurian era. In terms of military industrial production, January this year exceeded December last year by one time.

In terms of health services: The democratic government focused on organizing and encouraging Harbin's medical personnel to participate in war support and rear health construction. It successively organized eight medical workers' groups including doctors of Chinese and Western medicine and nurses, with a total of more than 1,000 members, and mobilized more than 1,600 medical personnel to participate in war support medical work, organized infectious disease hospitals and epidemic prevention teams, and set up a hospital in each of the five districts to treat citizens. Many poor people also received preferential treatment for free medical treatment. In the past two years, 5,000 people have been organized to participate in four epidemic prevention operations to eliminate cholera and plague. During the severe plague in the autumn, the city's vaccination work was completed in sixteen days, and only 56 people died.

In terms of public security and judicial work: The judicial policy implements the policy of leniency, strives for education, reforms the litigation and trial system, cancels litigation fees and petition donations, and can directly express opinions in front of the judge and request legal protection. It is also stipulated that detention without trial is not allowed, and the settlement period for general criminal cases does not exceed one month. There is no sitting in the "main hall" or on the platform, reasoning based on evidence, the use of torture is prohibited, and the system of redress is implemented. 77% of civil cases are closed within three days. Prisons transform prisoners through labor and make them self-reliant in order to reduce the burden on the people. In July last year, the government allocated 6 million yuan in production funds and a part of production tools. Now there are clothing factories, iron factories, printing factories, weaving factories, woodworking factories, vegetable gardens, etc. in the prison, which can regularly allow one-third of the prisoners to participate in production. From July last year to March this year, the net profit of production reached more than 50 million yuan. In addition to food, the remaining clothes, food money, and other supplies can be completely self-sufficient. Prisoners can also share profits in production. After discussion by the democratic assembly, those who produce well and make rapid progress can also have their sentences reduced. Prisoners' management implements autonomy, prohibiting insults and beatings against prisoners, and abolishing all corporal punishment and terror. The current court has five factories and one farm, with only one manager and a few technical instructors. Including those who manage production and guard, there are only twelve people in total. They regularly hold meetings to conduct rewards and punishments and discuss the improvement of prisoners' lives. Generally, prisoners have one to two hours of exercise every day. There are various sports equipment in the prison. In addition, drama groups and music groups have been established, there is a reading room, and wall newspapers are published. Prisoners regularly hold meetings to review themselves, so that everyone recognizes their own "root of sin" and is transformed.

　　哈尔滨建设两周年
    【新华社东北三日电】自一九四六年四月二十八日解放军进驻哈尔滨后，两年来随着东北整个形势的发展，经过了艰苦的摸索过程和民主政府与全市各阶层人民共同努力，哈尔滨市在东北解放区内的作用日益增长，成为全东北人民的心脏，她无论在支前、工商业、文化教育、市政建设各方面都获得了不少成绩，使人民城市日益稳固与繁荣，并打下进一步发展的基础，使之更有力支援大规模战争，完成解放全东北光辉的历史任务。这一伟大成绩特别是与劳动人民的觉悟与创造及依靠群众发动群众密切联系着的。兹将两年来哈市各项市政建设，综述如下：
