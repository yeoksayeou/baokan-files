　　Today's Changchun

How eagerly does Changchun in darkness await the dawn! Chiang Kai-shek's bandit rule has brought hunger and cold to more than 600,000 people in Changchun. Since last winter, the prices of rice and coal have been rising continuously. By March this year, the price of rice skyrocketed from 30,000 Chiang coins per pound to over 100,000, and coal was simply unavailable. Chiang's bandit troops have been wantonly demolishing civilian houses, doors, and windows in the city and suburbs of Erdaohezi, Songjiwazi, Nanling, etc., selling them as firewood at a price of 600-700 yuan per pound, making a fortune through robbery. When the citizens began to dig up coal piles from the puppet Manchukuo era as fuel, Chiang's troops, seeing the potential for profit, suddenly sent people to guard them, saying, "If you want to dig, you have to pay first." The puppet Changchun municipal government has not paid salaries for two months. Ordinary civil servants have no way out. Qin Lantang, the head of the education section, has sold everything he owned. One day, Qin was on duty and did not return home. His wife strangled their two children and then hanged herself. Another teacher couple slept together, and when they woke up in the morning, the wife was frozen to death by his side. Currently, those citizens who can regularly eat tofu dregs and cornmeal porridge mixed with bran are considered middle class.

Some time ago, Chiang's 60th Army fled from Jilin. Those who were lucky enough to reach Changchun were in a terrible state, all looking gaunt and emaciated. They had lost all their heavy weapons, and half of them had no rifles. Li Hong, the puppet Changchun garrison commander, said that they had become the "Eighth Route Army's transport corps." With the arrival of the bandit troops from Jilin, the population of Changchun suddenly increased, and prices soared accordingly. Chiang's bandits were helpless. A small number of citizens who had been forced and deceived by Chiang's troops to retreat south were unable to live in Changchun and returned to Jilin one after another. Zhao Yuanqing, a student at Jilin Middle School, returned to Jilin and saw that under the administration of the democratic government, the citizens had escaped from hunger, a democratic order was immediately established, and industry and commerce were thriving. He suddenly realized his mistake and regretted being deceived in the first place. A midwife named Wang on Shuncheng Street, whose husband was a Western doctor, lost two of her three children on the way, and her husband was also separated from her. She carried a lot of valuable medicines and gold, but they were all "inspected" away by Chiang's troops along the way. She said, "I shouldn't have blindly run away."

The schools in Changchun have become unprecedentedly desolate. The teachers, for the sake of their jobs, still hold classes as usual, but less than half of the students attend. A large number of students have gone to the liberated areas of Jilin and Jiutai to continue their studies. Li Hong, the bandit Changchun garrison commander, therefore hates young students very much. On the night of April 15th, he dispatched a large number of soldiers and police to surround Changda University, placing a machine gun at the entrance of each small unit of housing. The martial law lasted until noon the next day before it was lifted, and eighty male students and six female students were arrested. But the result of this large-scale suppression was that more Changchun students ran to the liberated areas to find a bright future. "Go to the liberated area" has become the slogan of Changchun students. An economics student from Changda University who ran to Jilin said, "The situation is different now. Many teachers dare to openly curse Chiang Kai-shek and the darkness of the Chiang-controlled areas, and students dare to openly despise the special agents and lackeys among the students."

The bandit leader Li Hong has recruited many bandits and organized them into independent regiments. Together with his troops, they go to the countryside every day to rob grain, horses, and women. Every household in the southeastern suburbs has been looted several times. Of the 120 households in Chengcaogou, only 20 households are left, and the rest have fled to the liberated areas. In Xiao'antun, which has more than 50 households, only an old couple now lives in a dilapidated house. One day, the "disaster army" came to Chengcaogou. A man surnamed He did not run away. His grain had long been robbed, but the Chiang bandits insisted that he still had grain and pierced him to death with wire. A man surnamed Zhang had his grain robbed, his wife was raped by the bandits, and then he was beaten to death. Women who did not escape were all brutally raped by Chiang's bandits. The people of Changchun are struggling in deep water and are eagerly looking forward to the sound of cannons every day. An old man in Sidao Street said, "Alas! We are just afraid that the cannons won't sound." Because they know that if the sound of cannons is loud, it means that the People's Liberation Army has entered the city, and the day will dawn.

　　今日长春
    黑暗中的长春，是怎样盼望着黎明的到来埃蒋匪的统治，给长春六十多万人带来了饥饿与寒冷。从去年冬天起米煤价格一直上涨，到今年三月间，米一斤从蒋币三万元突涨到十万以上，煤根本没有。将匪军在市内和城郊二道河子、宋泣洼子、南岭等地大肆拆毁民房门窗，当木柴卖，索价每斤六、七百元，大发强盗财。当市民开始挖掘伪满时代的煤炭堆作为燃料时，蒋军见有利可图，忽然又派人看守起来，说“要掘可以，先得给钱。”伪长春市政府已两月未发薪，一般公务员走头无路，教育科长秦兰堂已当光卖净，一天秦值班未归，他妻把两个小孩勒死，随着她亦悬梁自尽。另一对教员夫妇睡在一起，天亮一看，妻却冻死在身边。现市民中能经常吃到豆腐渣和糠混玉米面粥吃的人，就算中产阶级了。
    前些时蒋军六十军从吉林逃出，那些侥幸到了长春的都狼狈不堪，一个个都面黄肌瘦，重武器已丢光，一半的人没有了步枪，长春伪警备司令李鸿说他们当了“八路的输送团”。吉林匪军一到，长春人口突增。物价也随之猛涨，蒋匪毫无办法，被蒋军强迫与受骗南撤的少数市民，到了长春根本无法生活，苦不堪言，纷纷返回吉林。吉林中学学生赵元庆回吉林后眼见在民主政府管理下，市民脱离了饥饿，民主秩序立即建立，工商业生气蓬勃，才恍然大悟，后悔当初受骗。顺城街助产士王氏，丈夫是西医，途中三个孩子失去两个，丈夫也冲散了，带着不少贵重药品及黄金，一路上被蒋军“检查”一光，她说：“千不该万不该跟着瞎跑”。
    长春的学校已空前冷落，教员们为了饭碗，虽还照例上课，但学生已不到一半。学生们大批的到吉林、九台解放区来升学。匪长春警备司令李鸿由此非常痛恨青年学生，四月十五号半夜，他出动大批军警包围长大，每一小单位房舍门口架一挺机枪，戒严直至第二天晌午方解除，捕去男生八十余名，女生六名。但这次大举镇压的结果，是更多的长春学生跑到解放区寻找光明出路。“到解放区去”已成为长市学生的口号。一位跑到吉林的长大经济系同学说：“时局不同了，很多教员都敢公开咒骂蒋介石和蒋管区的黑暗，同学也敢公开轻视学生中的特务走狗了”。
    匪首李鸿曾搜罗不少胡子，编成独立团，和他的部队一起，天天到四乡抢粮、抢马、抢妇女，东南市郊每家均被洗劫数次之多。城草沟一百二十户只剩下二十户，其余的都跑到解放区来了。五十多户的小安屯，现在只剩下一对老头老婆住在一间破房里。一天“遭殃军”到城草沟来，一姓何的没有跑，他的粮早被抢光，蒋匪硬说他还有粮，就用铁丝活活的把他穿死。一张姓的粮被抢光，妻还被匪徒强奸，然后又打死他。没跑掉的妇女都横遭蒋匪野兽奸污。长春老百姓在水深火热中挣扎着，天天渴望着大炮响，四道街一个老头子说：“唉！我们就怕炮不响。”因为他们知道如果炮声响得厉害就是解放军进城的日子到了，天就亮了。
