　　Resolutely Correcting the Left-Leaning Adventurist Errors in Gengle Village: Lessons Learned
　　陶鲁笳
This article is an excerpt of the first two parts of Comrade Tao Lujia, Organization Minister of the Taihang District Party Committee's article, "Resolutely Correcting the Left-Leaning Adventurist Errors in Gengle Village: Lessons Learned." We believe that such a profound review of errors, providing lessons learned, is of reference value to all regions. However, the serious errors pointed out in this article have been resolutely corrected under the direct leadership of the Taihang District Party Committee. The village has compensated those middle peasants, a small number of poor peasants and rural small industrialists and businessmen who were wrongly struggled against, and the land has been reallocated. Currently, the masses are in a stable mood and are actively engaged in production.

　　Gengle is the largest village in our old liberated area. The entire village has 1,620 households with 6,172 people. In early September of last year, a work group of over 50 people, headed by Comrade ×× of She County, was organized under the direct leadership of the District Party Committee to conduct a review and experiment in the village in accordance with the new policy. Not long after, because the main responsible comrades of the District Party Committee and the work group went to Yetao for a meeting, the District Party Committee failed to maintain regular contact with the work group during the three-and-a-half-month land reform movement. Later facts proved that the work group committed serious left-leaning adventurist errors on four major issues: the entire middle peasant class, rural small industry and commerce, old base cadres, and killing people. After returning from the Yetao meeting, the District Party Committee organized another work group composed of five comrades who had participated in the Yetao meeting to replace the original work group. For the past three months, according to the intentions of the District Party Committee, through discovering errors, correcting errors, and re-filling the gaps, the work has been brought to a preliminary conclusion. The work in the village has gone through such a serious, complex, and tortuous path, and it is indeed very necessary to summarize all our experiences and lessons in guidance, policy, and style to educate ourselves and the masses.

　　　　I. How Great Were the Left-Leaning Adventurist Errors of the Gengle Work Group?

    After arriving in Gengle, in establishing contact with the broad masses, and in enlightening the masses to consciously rise up and grasp the correct policies, criticizing past mistakes, we discovered the true situation of the various classes, and at the same time gradually and clearly understood the situation and the seriousness of the errors committed by the work group in the past.

    So, how serious were their mistakes? How great was the harm of left-leaning adventurism? The following are the results of our understanding:

    Seriously Infringed Upon the Interests of the Entire Middle Peasant Class

    Of the 344 households (accounting for over 21 percent of the total number of households in the village) who were targets of struggle in the village, 276 were middle peasants, accounting for 31 percent of the entire middle peasant class. Among them, 164 households had started from scratch through hard work, 77 households had descended from landlords and rich peasants before the War of Resistance (some for many years), and 35 households had been transformed from landlords and rich peasants into middle peasants through the "Double Reduction" struggle since the War of Resistance. In the previous leveling movement, they all suffered the same treatment as landlords and rich peasants, and about half of the households were driven out of their homes. This is a simple account of the middle peasants who were struggled against. What about those who were not struggled against? During the movement, middle peasants were often ordered by the poor peasant committees to help poor peasants and hired laborers harvest crops and sow wheat, or ordered to perform corvée labor. It is said that this was because poor peasants and hired laborers had no time because they were busy with the struggle; once corvée labor was required, the night school discussed who should go, and the poor peasants and hired laborers unanimously raised their hands and shouted, "Middle peasants go!" Does this not clearly illustrate how the interests of the entire middle peasant class were infringed upon?

    The Apparent Unity of the Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Was Not the Reality

    What about the situation of the poor peasants and hired laborers? On the surface, they seemed to be united. Because as a result of the movement, an average of two poor peasant or hired laborer households were allocated the houses, movable property, and household goods of one middle peasant household, they were naturally satisfied. But upon closer examination, it was not so. Because among them, many had kinship ties with the middle peasants who were struggled against, or because of tracing back three generations, the historical situation of their families was similar to that of the middle peasants who were struggled against, they were often apprehensive, fearing that one day the struggle would come to their own heads. In fact, four households had already been struggled against as landlords or rich peasants, and three of them had been beaten. Most of the poor peasants and hired laborers were also very fearful of the people's court at that time. A committee member of a poor peasant committee in a lane committed suicide by hanging himself because he had made some mistakes and feared going to court. Some poor peasants and hired laborers now recall: "At that time, many things were indeed unreasonable, but no one dared to say anything, for fear that people (referring to the leadership) would criticize them for being indistinguishable from landlords and rich peasants."

    Infringed Upon Rural Small Industry and Commerce, Disregarded Policies Toward Landlords and Rich Peasants

    Rural private small industry and commerce were almost completely infringed upon under the pretext of exploitation. The means of production, capital, and goods of ten handicraft workshops and small sundry shops were all confiscated. Among them were two oil presses, two dyeing shops, one blacksmith shop, one carpentry shop, two small sundry shops, one repair shop (copperware), and one silversmith. Of the ten households, except for one rich peasant and one small vendor, the remaining eight households were all middle peasants. The harm of this suicidal policy to the broad masses and the entire liberated area obviously does not need further explanation.

    What about the landlords and rich peasants? They were fundamentally not treated according to any policy. What was especially serious was that our comrades did not recognize that the policy of physically eliminating landlords was wrong, and still believed that it didn't matter if a few more landlords and rich peasants were killed. Therefore, in two people's court trials, a total of twelve people were sentenced to death, of which six were landlords and rich peasants, and four were mistakenly identified as landlords and rich peasants at the time, but were actually middle peasants. Obviously, they committed extremely serious principled errors on the issue of killing people. The current performance of landlords and rich peasants is both worried and pleased. They are worried about how they will live in the future, and whether their lives are still in danger? They are pleased that the chaos of the struggle is beneficial to them. For example, some landlords and rich peasants seized the opportunity to ridicule the middle peasants, saying, "Just take it! Once you are struggling, we can stand on the same pile of dirt."

    Kicked Aside the Party Branch, Causing Panic Among Party Members

    What about the situation of the Party branch? Since it was kicked aside by the work group, twenty-four of the 183 Party members have been struggled against by the masses (the remaining 17 were expelled from the Party), two were sentenced to death by the people's court, one committed suicide, one was sentenced to imprisonment, fifteen were struggled against, two were imprisoned, and twelve households were driven out of their homes. In particular, Jiang Yanlin, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, was completely unjustly sentenced to death, and Jiang Lulin (a new middle peasant), the director of the street warehouse (who was publicly recognized as a model custodian), suffered the tragic fate of his family being ruined because bad elements took the opportunity to retaliate. Therefore, this caused extreme terror and internal dissatisfaction among all Party members. In short, it is obvious that all these situations need no explanation. As soon as the work group left Gengle one day, internal fighting would break out among the peasants, the landlords and rich peasants would take the opportunity to counterattack, and the isolated minority would inevitably be the cadres of the poor peasant association.

　　　　II. Why Did the Gengle Work Group Commit Left-Leaning Adventurist Errors?

    According to what we have seen in the past three months of practical work, the main reasons why the Gengle work group committed the above-mentioned errors are the following four points:

    One-Sidedly Emphasizing the Interests of the Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers, Dividing the Party's Policies Toward All Classes

    Because they did not understand that the policies and treatment stipulated by the Party for all classes and strata in the countryside were complete, consistent, and indivisible, they only knew how to one-sidedly and excessively emphasize the interests of the poor peasants and hired laborers, and completely opposed the basic policy of satisfying the demands of the poor peasants and hired laborers to the Party's policies toward other classes and strata. Therefore, their understanding of the situation and determination of policies were bound to be one-sided. Therefore, they always adhered to two solidified viewpoints in their minds: one was to hold an absolute and mechanical view of leveling land, movable property, and houses. The other was that "dictatorship of the poor peasants and hired laborers" must be used to replace the "rotten" old base cadres. For example, after we arrived, we could still see slogans such as "The poor peasants and hired laborers are in power, the poor peasants and hired laborers say whatever they want." Since they had these two fixed viewpoints, they were unable to understand the actual situation of the various classes and strata. Although they also conducted some investigations and research, it was not an objective and scientific attitude at all. Instead, they first instilled their own viewpoints into the poor peasants and hired laborers, and then collected from them all one-sided and exaggerated reflections and materials that were in accordance with these viewpoints. All reflections and materials were rejected. In this way, they could only draw one-sided, exaggerated, and erroneous conclusions, completely forgetting the basic principle of proceeding from reality, treating phenomena as the essence of things, and therefore forgetting the basic methods of scientific analysis. Their formula for understanding the situation was often like this: first, let the poor peasants and hired laborers complain: Have you turned over? No. Why not? It must be because feudalism has not been completely eliminated. Why is it not thorough? It must be because the Party branch is not pure. Therefore, according to this formula, after first listening to the complaints of the poor peasants and hired laborers in Gengle, they unanalyzedly concluded that more than 60 percent of the poor peasants and hired laborers had not turned over, thus proving that the degree of feudal elimination was extremely incomplete. Therefore, before the poor peasant group took action, the first time they classified classes, they classified landlords and rich peasants as 21 percent of the number of households, and they approved it without any doubt. After the masses took action, they expanded the face of landlords and rich peasants to 23 percent, and they approved it without any doubt. Finally, when the whole village officially classified classes, they expanded this face to 25 percent, and they still approved it without any doubt. Of course, according to the formula, the third conclusion was that the Party branch was extremely impure. It is said that among the 183 Party members, there were 19 landlord and rich peasant elements, accounting for 10.38 percent of the total, of which 17 were village cadres. Therefore, it was undoubtedly considered that it was a form of middle peasants in power, and the essence of the dictatorship of landlords and rich peasants. In this way, their viewpoint of absolute leveling plus dictatorship of the poor peasants and hired laborers seemed to be confirmed. So their thinking became more affirmed. So their false reports were unconsciously produced. But what is the actual situation? According to our final analysis, the results are as follows: only about 45 percent of the poor peasants and hired laborers have not turned over, and the reasons are very complicated, and should be observed from at least the following four aspects. The first is that feudalism has not been thoroughly eliminated. What is the degree? There are a total of 25 landlord households in the village, 7 households were driven out of their homes, and now they still lack a lot of land and houses. The remaining 19 households with 61 people have only 80 houses, one head of livestock, and 148 mu of land, with a total output of 179 shi, with an average output of 2.7 dou per person. The reason why they exceeded the output was mostly because of military personnel, cadres, martyrs' families, widows and orphans, or population deaths and escapes, and they left a little more land. There are a total of 43 rich peasant households in the village. According to our final filling standard, 18 households have been thoroughly struggled against, and 25 households have been struggled against but not thoroughly, and about half of them are military personnel, cadres, martyrs' families, and widows and orphans. They still have a surplus of 264 mu of land (with a total output of 107 shi). After being struggled against, their other movable property, livestock, and houses are roughly equivalent to the situation of well-to-do middle peasants, and individual households still retain a considerable amount of base wealth. In short, the oil and water of the landlords and rich peasants are very small, and the land they take out can only solve 10 percent of the land needed by the poor peasants and hired laborers. The second is the rich peasant line in the distribution of fruits in the past. How serious is the situation? According to our understanding, among the 864 poor peasant and hired laborer households in the village, a total of 473 households have turned over in terms of land, accounting for 55 percent of the poor peasant class. Among them, 83 households exceeded the village average (including 22 Party members and cadres), and the exceeded output totaled 306 shi. If this number is all filled to the poor peasants and hired laborers, it can only solve 17 percent of what they need. But most of them were legally divided during the Double Reduction period; only a few illegally occupied more after the counterattack. Therefore, they cannot all be treated as occupying more fruits. Therefore, the situation of the rich peasant line on land is not obvious. The distribution of movable property, livestock, and houses is much more serious than land. After the May 4th Directive, the method of distributing movable property was to distribute it equally to middle and poor peasants according to household and population. The regulations for livestock were that households with more than 15 mu of land could be divided, and most of the houses were first picked by cadres and activists. In particular, more than 250 military personnel, cadres, and martyrs' families were not classified, and movable property, livestock, and houses were all special, and were divided first and more. So at that time, the poor peasants said: "Distributing fruits is like sweeping tombs during the Qingming Festival, the higher ones are higher." These are the situations of the rich peasant line. The third is caused by many objective reasons, rather than the above two reasons. For example, we analyzed the situation of four lanes. For example, according to land, there are a total of 199 deficit households (poor peasants), but among them, 39 households became deficit households again after turning over due to the increase in family population; there are 20 households that do not lack land according to the actual population, but are lacking land according to the land law conversion; 14 households that were reduced from middle peasants to poor peasants due to selling land due to the disaster in 1943; 19 immigrant households; 7 households with little land but sideline production is enough to maintain life; 3 households that did not lack land, but sold some land after the main labor force in the family joined the army, became cadres, or engaged in other occupations after the War of Resistance, and are now deficit households according to the population; and 2 households where the mother remarried and took the son away and sold the land, and now the son has returned to set up a household. The above totals 104 households, accounting for 52 percent of the deficit households. From these reasons, it can be seen that even after the poor peasants have turned over, there will be many natural or social reasons that will make him have to decline again. The fourth is that since the War of Resistance, about 20 percent of the land of the landlords and rich peasants has been legally transferred to the hands of middle peasants, either due to Double Reduction or due to free trade.

    Obviously, if they could have actually analyzed it from the above aspects earlier, they would not have conceptually concluded that feudalism was extremely incompletely eliminated.

    What is the real situation of the Party branch? In terms of composition, there is not a single landlord or rich peasant, middle peasants account for 21 percent, new middle peasants account for 20 percent, and poor peasants and hired laborers account for 59 percent. Judging from this filling, more than 50 percent of Party members are deficit households, like other poor peasants. According to what we have learned in the preliminary rectification of more than 180 Party members, those who are truly opposed by the masses, such as Yang Shuangui, Zhang Jin'ao (Branch Propaganda), and Wang Chunlin (Village Head), who are corrupt, degenerated, and have a bad work style, are less than 10 people, accounting for about 5 percent. Others who have problems with the ideological work style of occupying more fruits account for about 15 percent. Old cadres have negative emotions, but can still be saved, accounting for about 10 percent. Those who are incapable of doing anything account for about 8 percent. The remaining more than 60 percent are all good Party members, and 17 percent of Party members have become the backbone of the poor peasant association and the new farmers' association. At the same time, most Party members, like the masses, have democratic demands for a few bad Party members. These are the real situations of the Party branch. Obviously, if they had actually analyzed it like this earlier, they would not have conceptually concluded that the Party branch was so rotten that it had to be kicked aside.

    Classifying Classes Without Relying on Correct Policies, Creating a Set of Wrong Methods Themselves

    Their standards and methods for classifying classes were not based on correct policies, but on their erroneous guidelines and viewpoints, and created a set of wrong methods. Therefore, their criticism of past class classifications was also wrong. For example, they believed that the result of past class classifications, where the two ends (landlords, rich peasants and poor peasants, hired laborers) were narrowed and the middle was enlarged, was unreasonable. The reason is that the "transformed" (the term itself is wrong) landlords and rich peasants were all classified as middle peasants. At the same time, they believed that middle peasants should not have exploitation, and if there is exploitation, they should be rich peasants. These spirits were even more developed in the poor peasants and hired laborers. For example, the masses called the standards for classifying classes "eight rely on and eight do not rely on" - that is, flexibly measuring according to the eight conditions of land, houses, livestock, farm tools, household goods, decorations, foundations, and exploitation. And in terms of methods, they created a set of strange doorways such as tracing three generations, comparing pain, and weighing the gourd (the landlord and rich peasant did not recognize their separation from the family no matter when they separated). Since the poor peasants and hired laborers had this set of methods, when they saw whose oil and water was large, they could easily find a reason to put the hat of landlords and rich peasants on him. As a result, 106 households were wrongly classified due to tracing three generations and weighing the gourd. For example, a stone mason with only two mu of thin land was classified as a landlord because his great-grandfather and the former Qing Dynasty Zhao Tanhua were brothers. Thirty-six households were wrongly classified because of slight exploitation, five households were wrongly classified because of bad character, ten households were wrongly classified because of small vendors, handicrafts, and freelancers with only slight exploitation, and five households were wrongly classified because they were air-raid shelters. Jiang Zhongtai (a Party member) was a new wealthy middle peasant. His two sons were blacksmiths and opened a blacksmith shop. There were 12 people in his family. After turning over, he had a total of 40 mu of land. Because blacksmithing had to hire short-term workers during the busy farming season. He had been the general representative of the farmers' association during the 1946 movement, and may have offended some people. They classified him as a local tyrant rich peasant in October of last year. After he saw the composition list, he immediately jumped into the pond and committed suicide. In addition, they also had a serious mistake, that is, they divided the peasants too finely, and the components of middle and poor peasants had as many as 30 types. For example, after the middle peasant was divided into upper, middle, and lower, each type was further divided into broken, descending, rising, new, old, and revived. Poor peasants were also divided into upper, middle, and lower, and each type was further divided into broken, descending, and blood. It is said that the bloody lower poor is the most glorious component. Of course, there is no need to explain that the result of such a division is that the so-called most glorious component must be the most isolated.

    Attempting to Realize the Dictatorship of the Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers, Creating a Booming Movement

    The organizational line and struggle methods they adopted in the movement were also related to their wrong guidelines. In order to realize the "dictatorship of the poor peasants and hired laborers" they imagined, they consciously delayed organizing the new farmers' association. Of course, there was no need to establish a farmers' representative conference, because they were afraid of repeating the past mistake of "middle peasants in power." The new farmers' association was not established until after the climax of the struggle had passed. What was the situation after the establishment? Among the 81 farmers' association committee members, only 3 were new middle peasants, and the rest were all poor peasants and hired laborers, obviously not changing the essence and form of the so-called "dictatorship of the poor peasants and hired laborers." After kicking the Party branch aside, although they paid attention to mobilizing some poor peasant Party members to participate in the poor peasant association, their attitude towards them was often to come when called and leave when dismissed. If Party members said a few more words in the poor peasant association, they would be reprimanded with "It doesn't matter if you don't speak for two or three months, don't suppress the poor peasants and hired laborers." Conversely, if they didn't speak, they would be reprimanded with "Die behind, don't learn from the poor peasants and hired laborers," which was completely a punitive attitude. Therefore, the Party members recently summarized their sufferings in the September movement in ten words: "Look at the attitude of the superiors, and touch the thoughts of the poor peasants and hired laborers." Corresponding to this organizational line was a hasty and blind struggle method. For example, less than a week after the establishment of the poor peasant group, and just after the establishment of the village poor peasant committee, they suddenly heard that the targets of the struggle were dumping household goods outside, so they got hot-headed and ordered the poor peasant committee to deduct the targets of the struggle on the night of September 20. Overnight, the whole village deducted more than 300 people. After deducting them, before the class was clearly classified, they instructed the poor peasants and hired laborers in various streets and lanes to take action, making a booming struggle for 18 days. How to struggle? It was still the old trick, chasing household goods, chasing mistakes, forcing, hanging, beating, and parading. It is said that sending them to the people's court was a relatively new method, and they considered it to be a relatively successful creation. But the facts mentioned above can completely prove that the people's court they "created" has nothing in common with the people's court correctly advocated by the Party. Regardless of form or substance, it was a mass public trial meeting monopolized by the work group and without any democratic atmosphere. After the booming struggle had passed, they had not yet clarified the specific situation of the struggled, and they came up with a confused confiscation policy. "Large objects confiscated all, medium objects two-thirds, small objects one-third." As a result, most of the poor peasants and hired laborers in the streets and alleys did not divide them into large, medium, and small at all, and confiscated all of them uniformly. Someone suggested to them that they should correct it, but they ignored it.

    Why were they so blindly moving? One of the main reasons is that they always wanted to create a booming climax of the movement in their minds according to their above-mentioned fixed viewpoints, so during the movement, they were always afraid that the masses' emotions would be low, and when they saw a slight decline, they wanted to give the masses a morphine injection. They completely did not understand that in our old area, in general, artificially creating a booming so-called "climax of the movement" is bound to make mistakes.

    From the above analysis, it can be completely seen that their work style seriously exists with subjective one-sidedness, the hasty disease, hasty blind action, and other petty-bourgeois work styles that do not proceed from reality. They did not understand what is the Party's correct mass line, and everything was considered better to be left than right. They mistakenly replaced the Party's class line of relying on the poor peasants to unite the middle peasants and all anti-feudal elements to fight against the landlords and feudal rich peasants with the "poor peasant line" (this statement itself is wrong). Therefore, they completely replaced the Party's proletarian standpoint and viewpoint with the original (not yet awakened) standpoint and viewpoint of the poor peasant masses. They did not understand that although the poor peasant class is the most revolutionary class in the countryside and the class that the Party must rely on, some of their standpoints and viewpoints must be strictly distinguished from the Party's correct standpoint and viewpoint. For example, in order to satisfy their immediate interests, they demanded to damage the interests of the middle peasants, or to infringe on industry and commerce for selfishness, and to take physical elimination of the targets of the struggle and other wrong tendencies, which are contrary to our Party's correct policies. Therefore, the poor peasant masses must be strictly educated and corrected, otherwise it is abandoning leadership, that is, tailism, and our work group has committed this mistake. Obviously, the result is not for the poor peasants, but harming the poor peasants, not improving their level of awareness, but encouraging the development of their backward peasant consciousness. The other side of tailism is commandism. Our work group often has these two erroneous tendencies at the same time. For example, they are tailist to the poor peasants, but commandist to the middle peasants, tailist to the new cadres, but commandist to the old base cadres, even punitive. Sometimes it is not completely tailist to the poor peasants. If the poor peasants have any opposition to the guidelines they adhere to, in words or actions, it is commandism. Why is this? First of all, because they lack a complete and comprehensive mass viewpoint, and are blinded by wrong guidelines and policies, so that they cannot humbly listen to the voices and opinions of the broad masses of all classes. They completely do not understand that whether all our guidelines and policies are suitable for the actual situation must be tested among the broad masses. The so-called test is to allow the broad masses to criticize our guidelines and policies according to their own actual situation and their own personal experience. Of course, the criticism of the masses has correct and incorrect points. Therefore, after listening to the opinions of the masses, we must carefully analyze them according to the principles of the Party. For correct opinions, we must boldly accept them, and use them to modify or even overthrow our original wrong understanding of the actual situation and the wrong guidelines determined according to this understanding. For incorrect opinions, we must patiently explain to the masses according to the principles of the Party to improve the awareness of the masses. At the same time, we must also understand the way the masses criticize us, sometimes with words and sometimes with actions. When our democratic work style is not enough, there are often few words and many actions. For example, when confiscating the property of "targets of struggle," many poor peasants hesitated to go to the homes of the middle peasants who were being struggled against to move things, but no one dared to express their opinions. Our work group comrades clearly saw it, but did not see that their actions were expressing their opinions. In order to correct mistakes, we must first be good at discovering mistakes, and in order to discover mistakes, we must have a high degree of democratic work style, be good at enabling all the masses to dare to openly raise and argue their opposing opinions. At the same time, we must also be good at discovering such opposing opinions from the daily words and actions of the masses. If we never feel that there are opposing opinions, it means that we do not have true democracy, and without this true democracy, we are complete bureaucrats, and we cannot discover any of our mistakes.

    In short, as long as we can correctly grasp the principles of the Party (if we don't understand, we will study the documents more, and ask the superiors for instructions more), realize correct ideological leadership, establish extensive contact with the broad masses, and be prepared to discover and quickly correct all erroneous tendencies at any time, whether it is our own or the masses', then we will not constantly sway back and forth between tailism and commandism.

　　坚决纠正更乐村左倾冒险错误的经验教训
    陶鲁笳
    此文是节录太行区党委组织部长陶鲁笳同志所著“坚决纠正更乐村左倾冒险错误的经验教训”文内前两部分。我们认为象这样深刻检讨错误，提供经验教训，对各地都有参考价值。但本文所指出的严重错误，已在太行区党委直接领导下坚决纠正过来。该村对错斗中农、少数贫雇与农村小工商业者都进行了补偿，土地已抽补完毕，现群众情绪稳定，正闹生产。　　　　　　　　　　　——编者  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    更乐是我们老区最大的一个村子。全村共有一千六百二十户，六千一百七十二人。去年九月上旬，以涉县××同志为首，组织了五十余人的工作团，在区党委直接领导下，到该村按照新方针进行复查与实验。为时不久，因区党委和工作团主要负责同志都到冶陶开会，在三个半月的土改运动中，区党委未能与工作团取得经常的联系。后来的事实证明，工作团在对整个中农阶层，以及农村小工商业、老基础、杀人等四个重大问题上，都犯了严重的左倾冒险的错误。区党委从冶陶会议回来后，即另以五个参加过冶陶会议的同志组织工作组，代替原来的工作团。到现在三个来月，根据区党委的意图，经过发现错误、纠正错误、重新填补，初步告一段落。该村工作经过如此严重的复杂的曲折的道路，把我们自己在指导上、政策上、作风上全部的经验教训总结起来，教育我们自己并教育群众，确实是很必要的。
    　　　　一、更乐工作团的左倾冒险错误有多大？
    我们到更乐后，在与广大群众取得联系中，在启发群众自觉的起来掌握正确的方针政策，批判过去的错误中，便发现了各阶层群众的真实情况，同时也就逐渐明确地了解了过去工作团所犯错误的情况及其严重性。
    那末他们的错误究竟严重到什么程度呢？左倾冒险的危害到底有多大呢？下面几点就是我们了解的结果：
    严重侵犯了整个中农阶层的利益
    该村三百四十四户（占全村户数百分之二十一强）斗争对象中，二百七十六户是中农，占全部中农阶层的百分之三十一，其中一百六十四户完全是勤劳起家的，七十七户是抗战前（有的已多年了）从地主富农降下来的，还有三十五户是抗战以来经过双减斗争，由地主富农改变为中农的。他们在上次平分运动中，都遭受到了与地主富农同样的待遇，半数左右的户被扫地出门了。这是被斗中农的简单情况。没有被斗的怎样呢？在运动过程中，中农常常被贫农委员会命令着去帮助贫雇收秋、种麦，或者命令着去支差。据说因为贫雇要闹斗争没时间；有一次差务来了，在夜校里讨论叫谁去，贫雇群众一致举手大叫“中农去！”这不是很清楚的说明了，整个中农阶层的利益是如何被侵犯着？
    贫雇表面团结实际不是这样
    贫雇的情形又怎样呢？从表面上看，他们好象是团结的。因为运动的结果，平均二户贫雇分了一户中农的房子、浮财和内货，自然他们应该是满足了。但是只要仔细考察一下，也不是那样。因为他们之中，有很多与被斗中农有亲族连系，或者因追三代，其家庭的历史情况，也有和被斗中农相似之处，经常提心吊胆，害怕有一天斗争要临到自己头上。事实上已经有四户也被当作地富而斗争了，其中有三人挨了打。对当时的人民法庭多数贫雇也是很恐惧的。一个巷贫委会委员，因犯了些错误惧怕上法庭，上吊自杀了。现在有些贫雇回忆着说：“当时很多事情确实不讲道理，但是谁也不敢说，一说就怕人家（指领导上）批评和地富不分家”。
    侵犯农村小工商业者对地主富农不讲政策
    农村里的私人小工商业，因借口剥削，几乎全部被侵犯了，有十户手工业作坊和小杂货铺，生产工具、资本、货物全被没收了。其中有油房二、染房二、铁匠铺一、木匠铺一、小杂货铺二、修理铺（铜器）一、银匠一。十户中除一户为富农，一户为小商贩外，其余八户均为中农。这种自杀政策，对广大群众和整个解放区的危害，显然是用不着再加说明了。
    地主富农怎样呢？对他们是根本不讲究什么政策的。尤其严重的，我们同志还不认识肉体消灭地主的政策，是错误的政策，依然认为多弄死几个地主富农没啥关系。因此两次人民法庭，共判决死刑者十二人，其中六人是地主富农，四人当时被误认为地主富农，而实际是中农。显然的，他们在杀人问题上，犯了极其严重的原则性的错误。现在地主富农的表现，一忧一喜。忧的是今后如何生活，是否还有性命危险？喜的是斗乱了对他们有利。例如有些地主富农遇着机会便嘲笑中农说：“好好受吧！受起来了，咱们就可站到一个圪台上来了”。
    一脚踢开支部引起党员恐慌
    支部的情况又怎样呢？自从被工作团一脚踢开以来，一百八十三个党员，挨群众斗争的廿四人（其余十七人被开除党籍），人民法庭判处死刑的二人，自杀的一人，判徒刑的一人，挨斗争十五人，坐禁闭的二人，被扫地出门的十二户。尤其是武委会主任江彦林，完全冤屈地被判处了死刑，街仓库主任（群众公认为是模范保管者）江禄林（新中），因坏分子挟嫌报复，而遭到家破人亡的下场。因此，引起所有党员极端的恐怖与内心不满。总之，所有这些情况，显然用不着说明，只要有一天工作团一离开了更乐，农民内部便会发生混战，地主富农便要乘机反攻，而最后孤立的必然是少数的贫农团的干部。
    　　　　二、更乐工作团为什么犯了左倾冒险的错误呢？
    据我们在三个来月实际工作中所看到的，更乐工作团之所以犯上述错误的原因，主要有下面四点：
    片面强调贫雇利益，分割了党对各阶级的政策
    由于他们不了解党对农村各阶级各阶层所规定的政策及待遇是完整的、一致的，不可分割的。因而只知片面的过分的强调贫雇利益，把满足贫雇要求的基本政策，和党对其他各阶级各阶层的政策完全对立起来。因而他们了解情况确定方针也便必然是片面的。因而在他们脑子中，便始终坚持着两个凝固的观点，一个是对土地、浮财、房子都抱着绝对的机械的平均的观点。另一个是必须以“贫雇专政”来代替“腐烂”了的旧的基础。例如我们去了之后，仍可看到“贫雇掌权坐天下，贫雇说啥就是啥”的标语。他们既然有了这两个固定的观点，就使他们无法了解各阶级各阶层的实际情况。虽然他们也进行了些调查研究，但完全不是客观的科学的态度。而是先以他们自己这种观点，灌输给贫雇群众，然后从他们那里搜集一切按照这些观点而来的片面的夸大的反映和材料。一切反映和材料，则一律加以排斥。如此他们便只能得出片面的夸大的错误的结论，完全忘记了从实际出发的基本原理，把现象当成事物的本质，因而也忘记了科学分析的基本方法。他们了解情况的公式常常是这样的：首先让贫雇诉苦：翻透身没有？没有。为什么没有？一定是封建消灭不彻底。为什么不彻底？一定是支部不纯。于是他们依据这个公式，在更乐首先听取贫雇的诉苦后，毫不加分析地便得出百分之六十以上的贫雇未翻透身的结论，因而证明封建消灭程度极不彻底，因而贫雇小组在未行动前第一次划阶级把地主富农划为户数的百分之廿一，他们又毫不怀疑的批准了。群众行动起来后，又把地主富农面扩大到百分之二十三，他们毫不怀疑地批准了。最后全村正式划阶级，又把这个面扩大到百分之廿五，他们还是毫不怀疑地批准了。当然依照公式，第三个结论便是支部极端不纯，据说，一百八十三个党员中，有十九个地富分子，占总数百分之十点三八，其中有十七个是村干部。因而毫不怀疑的认为是中农当道的形式，地主富农专政的实质，如此，他们的绝对平加上贫雇专政的观点，似乎都得到证实了。于是他们思想上便更加肯定起来了。于是他们的假报告也便不自觉地产生了。但是事实究竟怎样呢？根据我们最后分析的结果是这样的：贫雇没有翻透身的只有百分之四十五左右，而且其原因是很复杂的，至少应该从下述四方面来观察。其一是封建消灭不彻底，其程度是怎样呢？全村地主共二十五户，七户被扫地出门，现在土地房子还缺的很多，其余十九户六十一口人，只剩房八十间、牲口一头，地一百四十八亩，合产量一百七十九石，每人平均产量二石七斗。他们超过产量的原因，大部为军、干、烈属、孤寡或人口死亡逃散，而多留了些土地。全村富农共四十三户，按我们最后填补标准，已斗争彻底的十八户，斗争而未彻底的二十五户，半数左右为军、干、烈属和孤寡。他们还长余土地二百六十四亩（合产量一百零七石），其他浮财、牲口、房子被斗后，大体相当于富裕中农的情况，个别户还保有相当数量的底财。总之，地主富农的油水很小了，他拿出来的土地，只能解决贫雇所需土地的百分之十。其二是过去分果实中的富农路线，其情况到底严重到什么程度呢？据我们了解，全村八百六十四户贫雇中，从土地看已翻身的共四百七十三户，占贫雇阶层百分之五十五。其中超过全村平均数的八十三户（内党员和干部共二十二户），超过的产量共三百零六石。如果将此数全部填补给贫雇，也只能解决他们所需的百分之十七。但是他们大部为双减时期合法分得的；反攻后非法多占的，只是个别的。因此不能都当作多占果实来处理的。所以在土地上富农路线的情况是并不明显的。浮财、牲口、房子的分配，则较土地严重得多。五四指示后分浮财的办法，不分中贫农按户按人口平均分配。牲口规定十五亩地以上户才能分得，房子大部尽干部、积极分子先挑。特别是二百五十多户军、干、烈属，不分阶级，浮财、牲口、房子一律特殊，先分多分。所以当时贫雇说：“分果实是清明上坟，高者愈高”。这些就是富农路线的情况。其三是因许多客观原因，而非上述两个原因而造成。例如我们分析了四个巷的情况，如按土地看，窟窿户（贫农）共有一百九十九户，但其中因翻身之后，家庭人口增多，因而又成为窟窿户的卅九户；人口少，按实有人口土地不缺，但按土地法折合即有廿户缺土地；因四三年灾荒卖地而由中农降为贫农的十四户；外来移民十九户；土地少但副业生产足以维持生活的七户；原来不缺地，因抗战后家中主要劳力参军、当干部或从事其他职业而卖了一些土地，现在按人口算又成为缺地户的三户；母亲改嫁将儿子带走田地卖了，现在儿子又回来立户的二户，以上共一百零四户，占窟窿户的百分之五十二。从这些原因中可以看出，即使贫雇翻了身之后，还会有许多自然的或社会的原因而使他不得不再下降的。其四是抗战以来地主富农的土地，或由于双减，或由于自由买卖，而合法转到中农手里的，约占地主富农土地的百之分二十左右。
    显然的，如果他们早些能从以上几方面来实际分析，那末便不会那样概念地得出封建消灭极不彻底的结论了。
    支部的真实情况又怎样呢？在成份上看，地主富农一个也没有，中农占百分之二十一，新中农占百分之二十，贫雇占百分之五十九。从这次抽补中来看，百分之五十以上的党员和其他贫雇群众一样是窟窿户。据我们在初步整顿中所了解的一百八十多个党员中，象杨双贵、张金鳌（支宣）、王春林（村长）等贪污腐化、蜕化忘本、作风恶劣，为群众真正反对的分子，不足十人，约占百分之五。其他多占果实思想作风有毛病的，约占百分之十五。老干部有消极情绪，但尚可挽救的，约占百分之十。没能力不死不活的，约占百分之八。其余百分之六十以上，都是好党员，而且百分之十七的党员，已成了贫农团与新农会的骨干。同时多数党员对少数坏党员，和群众一样，也同样存在着民主的要求。这些就是支部的真实情况。显然的，如果他们早些这样来作实际分析，那末便不会那样概念地得出支部已腐烂不堪，必须一脚踢开的结论了。
    划阶级不依据正确的政策自己创造了一套错误办法
    他们划阶级的标准和办法，不是依据正确的政策，而是依据他们错误的方针和观点，创造了一套错误的办法。因而他们对过去划阶级的批判，也是错误的。例如他们认为过去划阶级的结果，两头（地富和贫雇）缩小，中间加大是不合理的。理由是把“化形”（这个名词的本身就是错误的）的地主富农，都划到中农里来了。同时他们认为中农不应有剥削，有剥削便应是富农。这些精神，传到贫雇中，便更加发挥了。例如群众把划阶级的标准，叫做八靠八不靠——就是按照土地、房屋、牲口、农具、内货、摆饰、根底、剥削等八个条件灵活的衡量的意思。而且在方法上，创造了一套追三代、比痛苦、掂都芦（地主富农不管什么时候分了家的，不承认其分家的意思）等怪明堂。贫雇既有了这套办法，于是看见谁家的油水大，便可随便找到一条理由，给他戴上地主富农的帽子。结果，因追三代掂都芦而划错的一百零六户。例如把一户仅有二亩薄地的石匠，因曾祖父与前清赵探花为兄弟而划为地主了。因有轻微剥削而错划的三十六户，因为人品不好而错划的五户，因小商贩、手工业、自由职业，只有轻微剥削而错划的十户，因当防空洞而错划的五户，江中泰（党员）是个新富裕中农，两个儿子是铁匠，开了一个铁匠铺，家有十二口人，翻身后共有地四十亩，因打铁不得不于农忙时雇短工。四六年运动时，他曾当过农会总代表，可能得罪过些人。他们去年十月划成份，把他订为恶霸富农。他看了成份榜后，立刻跳池自杀了。另外，他们还有个严重的错误，就是把农民内部分得过细，中贫农的成份，名称多至三十余种。例如中农分上、中、下后，每种又分破、降、升、新、旧、复兴等。贫农亦分上、中、下，每种又分破、降、血。据说血下贫是最光荣的成份。当然用不着说明，这样划分的结果，所谓最光荣的成份，必须是最孤立的。
    企图实现贫雇专政制造轰轰烈烈运动
    他们在运动中所采取的组织路线与斗争方式也是与他们错误的方针相关联的。为了实现他们所想象的“贫雇专政”，他们有意识地拖延时间不组织新农会。当然也无需成立农代会，因为他们害怕重复过去“中农当道”的错误。新农会直到斗争高潮过去之后才成立。成立后是什么情况呢？八十一个农会委员中，只有三人是新中农，其他全部是贫雇，显然并未改变所谓“贫雇专政”的实质和形式。对支部一脚踢开后，虽然注意发动一部分贫雇党员参加了贫农团，但对他们的态度经常是招之即来，挥之即去。党员在贫农团中如多说了些话，即训以“两三个月不说话不要紧，不要压制贫雇”。反之如不说话，即训以“死落后，不向贫雇学习”，完全是惩办主义的态度。所以最近党员们总结他们九月运动中的苦处，概括为十个字“看上级态度，摸贫雇心思”。与这种组织路线相适应的，便是草率盲目的斗争方式。例如，贫农小组成立还不到一个礼拜，全村贫委会刚成立，他们忽然听到斗争对象在往外倒内货，于是脑子一热，便于九月二十日半夜由贫委会下令大扣斗争对象。一夜工夫，全村就扣了三百多人。扣起来后，阶级还没划清楚，就指令各街各巷贫雇行动起来，闹了十八天轰轰烈烈的斗争。怎样斗争呢？还是过去的老一套，追内货、追错误、逼、吊、打、游街。据说送人民法庭是较新鲜的办法，而且被他们认为是一个比较得意的创造。但前面所述那些事实中，完全可以证明，他们所“创造”的人民法庭，与党所正确提倡的人民法庭，是没有丝毫共同之点的。不管形式上实质上都是工作团包办的、毫无民主气味的群众公审大会，当着轰轰烈烈的斗争过去之后，还没有弄清被斗者的具体情况，糊里糊涂又来了个没收政策。“大对象没收全部、中对象三分之二、小对象三分之一”。结果大多数街巷的贫雇，根本没分大、中、小，一律全部没收了。有人向他们提出要纠正，但未被他们所理会。
    为什么他们会如此盲动呢？主要原因之一，就是因为他们脑子中总想按照他们上述的固定观点，来它一个轰轰烈烈的运动高潮，所以在运动过程中，总是怕群众情绪低落，稍见低落时，就想给群众打吗啡针。他们完全不了解，在我们老区一般的情况下，人为地制造轰轰烈烈的所谓“运动高潮”，是一定要犯错误的。
    他们的工作作风，从以上分析的情况中，完全可以看出严重地存在着主观片面，急性病草率盲动等不从实际出发的小资产阶级作风。不了解什么是党的正确的群众路线，一切都认为左比右好。错误地把“贫雇路线”（这个提法本身就是不对的）代替了党的依靠贫雇团结中农以及一切反封建分子向地主和封建富农作斗争的阶级路线。因而他们就把贫雇群众的原始的（尚未提高觉悟的）立场观点，完全代替了党的无产阶级的立场观点。不了解贫雇阶级，虽然是农村中最革命的阶级，是党所必须依靠的阶级，但他们的立场观点中，有一些是必须与党的正确的立场观点严格划清界限的。例如他们为了满足自己眼前的利益，要求损伤中农的利益，或者为了自私而侵犯工商业，对斗争对象采取肉体消灭等等错误的倾向，都是与我们党的正确政策相违背的。因此必须对贫雇群众进行严格的教育与纠正，否则便是放弃领导，也便是尾巴主义，我们的工作团正是犯了这种错误。显然的，其结果，不是为了贫雇，而是害了贫雇，不是提高他们的觉悟程度，而是鼓励他们农民落后意识的发展。尾巴主义的另一面，便是命令主义。我们的工作团，常常同时存在着这两个错误倾向。例如他们对贫雇是尾巴主义的，而对中农则是命令主义的，对新干部是尾巴主义的，而对老基础则是命令的，甚至是惩办主义的。有时对贫雇也不完全是尾巴主义的。贫雇中如有对他们所坚持的方针，在言论上行动上表现抵触时，就是命令主义的。为什么这样呢？首先是因为他们缺乏完整的全面的群众观点，而又被错误的方针和政策所蒙蔽，使他们不能虚心的倾听各阶层广大群众的呼声和意见。他们完全不了解，我们的全部方针和政策，是否适合于实际情况，必须放到广大群众中去考验。所谓考验，就是要让广大群众根据其自身的实际情况和他们切身的经验，来批判我们的方针和政策。当然群众的批判，有正确的，也有不正确的。所以我们在倾听群众意见之后，还要根据党的原则细心的加以分析。对正确的意见，就必须大胆接受，并依此来修改甚至推翻自己原来对实际情况的错误认识以及根据这个认识所确定的错误方针。对不正确的意见，则必须根据党的原则，给群众作耐心的解释，以提高群众的觉悟。同时还必须了解群众对我们的批判方式，有时以言论，有时则以行动。当我们民主作风不够时，常常是言论少而行动多。例如没收“斗争对象”财产的时候，有很多贫雇对被斗中农的都犹豫不去他们家搬东西，但谁也不敢发表意见。我们工作团同志明明看到了，但没有看出他们的行动，是表示他们有意见。为了纠正错误，首先必须善于发现错误，而为了发现错误，必须要有高度的民主作风，善于使所有群众，敢于将自己相反的意见，公开的提出来争论。同时还要善于从群众日常的言论行动中，发现这种相反的意见。如果我们任何时候都感觉不出有相反的意见存在，便说明我们没有真正的民主，而没有这种真正的民主，我们便是十足的官僚主义者，我们便不能发现自己任何的错误。
    总之，只要我们能够做到正确的掌握党的原则（如不了解就多研究文件，多请示上级），实现正确的思想领导，与广大群众取得广泛联系，并随时准备发现与迅速纠正一切错误倾向，不管是自己或群众的，那末我们就不至于经常在尾巴主义与命令主义之间来回摇摆了。
