To the Editorial Staff:

All villages in Shahe County that have undergone democratic party rectification and filling movements have entered the stage of class division. Around the 10th of this month, the County Committee and the land reform work team leaders held a joint meeting to study the issue of class division. However, we were unclear about a few specific issues and did not dare to make a decision. Please provide answers:

(1) In Nanzhang Village, there is a household named Wang Cheng. He owns ten mu of land and rents over thirty mu of land from others, totaling forty mu of land. He relies entirely on hired laborers. His entire family has only one laborer, himself, but he does not participate in agricultural labor. He runs a lime kiln, hiring several workers, and acts as the manager, only participating in lime burning as an assistant. The main source of income for his family is the lime kiln (exceeding 50% of agricultural income). During the discussion, some people argued that he was an old-style rich peasant, while others argued that he was a handicraft capitalist. No decision was made.

(2) What is a new-style hired laborer and what is an old-style hired laborer? What are the important distinctions in their conditions?

(3) In Nangao Village, Qiao Jianü lived with a landlord as a long-term laborer for over twenty years. This landlord hired three long-term laborers every year, and Jianü acted as the foreman. Because she had a long-term intimate relationship with the landlord's wife, this person lived similarly to the landlord, not frequently working in the fields (but still working enough for four months of the year). She suppressed other workers severely, collecting rent and managing the household for the landlord, doing everything. She also did not earn wages. Her family consisted of only herself. The masses called her a "sticky long-term laborer." So she was struggled against in the movement. Later, she was given some belongings, and then she started living with the landlord again. During the study, some comrades said that she cannot be considered a hired laborer, and others argued that she is not a second landlord. What exactly is she? It is unclear.

(4) Can animal power be equivalent to labor power? Since the establishment of mutual aid teams, a large number of landlords, rich peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants have joined the mutual aid teams. These households all have good animal power. Due to the principle of equivalent exchange in the mutual aid teams, labor power is exchanged for animal power (poor peasants do not have animal power). These households hire more people, turning into hiring fewer people, and hiring fewer people turns into not hiring people. The amount of exploitation of long-term and short-term laborers is reduced. Is the labor power obtained by exchanging animal power considered exploitation? How should it be calculated, and what are the reasons?

(5) When calculating exploitation, should short-term laborers and long-term laborers be calculated the same way? Some comrades say that short-term laborers are hired during busy times, and the amount of exploitation per day for short-term laborers is more than that of long-term laborers. According to regulations, landlords and rich peasants who participate in labor for four months a year are equivalent to one laborer. Therefore, some comrades argue that hiring short-term laborers for four months should also be calculated as one long-term laborer when calculating the exploitation ratio. How is it appropriate?

(6) Is the "price difference silver" (转价银) of rich peasants considered exploitation? During class division, it was discovered that many rich peasant households sold land in the past and sold the land at a higher price than it was worth. In the past, the heavy silver taxes were often paid entirely or mostly by others on behalf of the landlord. Some masses say: this is more severe than hiring people for exploitation.

(7) Should wrongly struggled against middle and poor peasants have their class status changed after one year? Central regulations stipulate that those who have been demoted from middle peasant to poor peasant or promoted from poor peasant to middle peasant for a full year will have their class status changed. But for rich middle peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants who were wrongly struggled against in the past, should their class status be changed if they have lived other lives for a full year after the struggle? If so, can they participate in the poor peasant associations, and what are the reasons?

Please reply to the above questions immediately.

(Wang Xing)

Comrade Wang Xing:

(1) Wang Cheng's class status should not be determined as an old-style rich peasant. The feudal exploitation of an old-style rich peasant exceeds one-half of his net income. More than three-quarters of Wang Cheng's land is not self-owned but rented, possessing only capital without feudal land ownership. This determines that his agricultural income is basically capitalist exploitation rather than feudal. Even if his agricultural net income exceeds the income from the lime kiln, he can only be considered a member of the new-style rich peasant class - a tenant rich peasant - and should not be considered an old-style rich peasant. And since the main source of income for his family is the lime kiln, and he hires several workers to burn lime while he himself only provides supplementary labor and is in a supervisory and management position, he can be considered a handicraft capitalist.

(2) According to the central regulations on class division, there are no terms such as "new-style hired laborer" or "old-style hired laborer." There are only the terms "feudal-style hired laborer" and "ordinary hired laborer," but they only describe the nature of the hired laborer, and do not mean that there are such two classes. Feudal-style hired laborer refers to hired laborers with harsh conditions, where the employer has feudal privileges over the hired laborer (not recognizing that the hired laborer has complete human rights, arbitrarily enslaving them, without freedom, not a free labor force, and is subordinate to the land of the old operating landlords and old-style rich peasants).

(3) Regarding Qiao Jianü's class status, it still depends on how long she has been living similarly to the landlord, and how they are similar? How was this landlord determined, and what are the specific circumstances? Please provide more detailed information.

(4) The exchange of labor and animal power in mutual aid teams should not be considered exploitation.

(5) Hiring short-term laborers and hiring long-term laborers are both hiring laborers. According to the standards for class division, short-term and long-term laborers are not separated. When calculating exploitation, the actual labor situation, wage situation, and the amount of exploitation income should be considered. It is not enough to only consider a few people; the size of the labor force and the amount of wages should also be considered (such as agricultural production materials obtained by short-term laborers through equal exchange during busy seasons should not be counted as exploitation income). Short-term laborers put in more labor per day, but their wages are also often higher, and their food is also better, so the amount of exploitation per day may not necessarily be more than that of long-term laborers. It must be calculated according to the actual situation at the local time, and no general fixed regulations can be made.

(6) Regarding the rich peasant's "price difference silver," what you said is not clear enough. If it is like this: when a rich peasant sold land in the old society, he sold a part of the land, and the buyer had to pay most or all of the land tax (field tax paid to the government) for the other land that he himself was still cultivating; this should be counted as feudal exploitation. Most of those who bought land under such harsh conditions were poor and hired peasants. Because the land occupied by rich peasants beyond the part that their own labor could cultivate is feudal occupation; poor and hired peasants urgently require land, so when buying land from rich peasants, they even have to pay the field tax for land other than the land they bought, which is the same as the nature of usury and land rent.

(7) For middle and poor peasants who have been downgraded due to wrongful struggles, the main issue is compensating their losses. Their demotion is due to wrongful struggles rather than normal升降. As for whether they can join the poor peasant associations, based on their original actual situation and the compensated situation, if they meet the conditions for joining the association, they should be allowed to participate.

### 对沙河划阶级中几个问题的答复

　　对沙河划阶级中几个问题的答复编辑同志：
    沙河县凡进行民主整党填补运动的村，都已进入划阶级的阶段，本月十号前后，召开了县委和土改工作队长联席会议，研究划阶级问题时，有几个具体问题，我们也闹不清，未敢决定，请答复：
    （一）南掌村有一户，叫王澄，自己有地十亩，租别人地三十余亩，共地四十亩，全靠雇长工受，全家只有他是一个劳力，但不参加农业劳动，开着一座灰窑，雇着好几个伙计，自己为掌柜，只附带参加烧灰劳动。他家的生活主要来源是灰窑（超过农业的收入百分之五十）。在讨论中，一些人主张是旧式富农，一些人主张为手工业资本家，未决定。
    （二）什么叫新式雇工，什么叫旧式雇工？他的条件不同点区别的重要地方在哪里。
    （三）南高村，乔贾女与一个地主住长工二十余年，这地主每年雇长工三个，贾女为工头，由于他与该地主女人有很长时间的肉体关系，所以这人生活与地主同样，不经常上地（一年也劳动够四个月了），压制其他工人很厉害，给该地主收租、管家、啥也干，他也不赚工资，他家也没人，群众叫这是“连毛长工”。所以在运动中一样被斗了。后来又给他一部分东西，便又与这户地主伙过起来。研究中，有的同志说不能算雇工，有的主张不是二地主，到底算啥？圪倒不清。
    （四）畜力能否顶劳力——自成立互助组后，一大部分地主、富农、富裕中农参加了互助组，这些户都有很好的畜力，由于互助组等价，劳畜力相互换工（贫农没畜力），这些户多雇人，变成少雇人，少雇人变为不雇人，雇长工及短工的剥削量便减少。这样用畜力换取的劳力工是否算剥削？该怎样计算，理由是啥。
    （五）算剥削时，短工与长工是否一样计算？有的同志说，雇短工都在忙时候，雇短工一天剥剥量比长工要多，按规定地主富农一年参加四个月劳动，就顶一个劳力，所以有的同志主张，雇短工四个月，也应以一个长工来计算剥削比，怎样合适？
    （六）富农的转价银算剥削否？在划阶级中，发现不少富农户过去卖地，便把地银多卖出了，过去很重的银钱，往往被其他人替地主全部或大部出了，有的群众说：这比雇人剥削还厉害。
    （七）斗错的中、贫农，一年是否变成份？中央规定，凡中降贫或贫升中满一年者便变其成份。但在过去斗争错了的富裕中农、中农、贫农，斗后过其它生活满一年者，是否要变其成份？如变能否参加贫农团，理由是啥？
    以上问题请立即答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（王兴）王兴同志：
    （一）王澄的成份不应定为旧式富农。旧式富农的封建剥削是超过纯收入的二分之一的。王澄的土地四分之三以上不是自有而是租入的，只占有资本而没有封建的土地所有权，这就决定了其农业收入基本上也是资本主义性的剥削，而不是封建性的。即使他的农业纯收入超过灰窑的收入，也只能认为新式富农中的一个阶层——佃富农，而不应认为旧式富农。而他家的生活主要来源既是靠灰窑，他烧窑雇着好几个伙计，本人只有附带劳动，居于监督管理地位，可认为手工业资本家。
    （二）按中央划阶级规定，没有“新式雇工”“旧式雇工”字样。只有“封建式雇工”和“普通雇工”字样，但也只是说明雇工的性质，而不是说有这么两个阶层。封建式雇工，指雇工条件苛刻的，雇主对雇农有封建特权的（不承认雇农有完全的人权，随便奴役，不能自由，不是自由的劳动力，而附属于旧经营地主及旧式富农的土地）。
    （三）乔贾女的成份，还要看他的生活与地主同样已经多长时间，如何相同？这一户地主是如何确定的，具体情况如何？请再详细告知。
    （四）互助组的劳畜力换工，不能认为剥削。
    （五）雇短工、雇长工都同样是雇工。按划阶级的标准，并没有分开短工、长工，计算剥削时应按实际劳动情形、工资情形及剥削收入多少；不能只按几个人算，还要看劳动力大小，工资多少（如农忙时某些以等价交换所雇短工的生产物，不得算作剥削收入）。短工每天出的劳动力要多些，但工资也往往较高，吃的也较好，所以每天的剥削不一定比长工多。要按当地当时实际情形计算，无法作一般的固定的规定。
    （六）关于富农的“转价银”，你说的不够清楚。如果是这样：富农在旧社会卖地时卖一部分地而把其他他自己还种着的地的地银（向官府缴纳的田赋）也大部或全部都要买地的人替他缴纳；这应该算作封建剥削。以这样苛刻的条件买地的，大都是贫雇农。因为富农除自己劳力能种那一份土地以外的土地占有是封建性的占有；贫雇农因迫切要求土地而在买富农的地时连所买土地以外的田赋也要代出，这和高利贷、地租的性质是相同的。
    （七）中贫农因错斗而下降的，问题主要是在补偿其损失。他们的下降，是因错斗而不是正常的升降。至于是否能入贫农团，可按他原来的实际情形和补偿后的状况，符合入团条件的，就应该要他们参加。
