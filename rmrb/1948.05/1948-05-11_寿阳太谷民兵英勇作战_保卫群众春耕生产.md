    【Taihang News】The militias of Shouyang and Taigu are actively fighting and winning consecutive battles to protect spring farming for the masses, and have been rewarded and commended by the Second Military Subdistrict's Military Commission. On the 15th of last month, more than 100 bandits from Yan's 49th Division stationed in Caogou, Shouyang, went to Sanjing Village in our Lunan area to loot grain. The village militia was prepared in advance, having laid landmines beforehand. Upon discovering the enemy, they immediately covered the safe evacuation of all the villagers, and then cooperated with a detachment of the rotational defense team to lure the enemy into a trap with sniping. The enemy fell into the ambush set by our militia, with landmines detonating and sniping combined, killing a total of 13 enemies, recovering more than 5 shi of grain, more than 40 sheep, and more than 100 pieces of clothing that had been looted from the masses. The enemy hastily fled. On the 16th, more than 100 bandits from Yan's unit in Li yan of Yuci went to Duanting in our Lubei section of Shouyang to rob again. The militias of Changling and Yunyan villages in our Lunan area, upon hearing the news, immediately rushed to attack, wiping out five enemies and recovering some grain and clothing. The enemy could not withstand and retreated in disarray. In the above two battles, our militia suffered no casualties. In another instance, the Yan bandits stationed in Taigu launched a joint attack on Guanzhai and Niangou areas in the heart of our Third District from the 15th to the 18th, using three regiments of troops. The militia of the district had previously laid dozens of landmines in a ditch from Pangzhuang to Guanzhai. When the enemy advanced, more than 20 of them were detonated, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy (the results are yet to be determined). This played a significant role in protecting spring farming, and the masses are very supportive of the militia. The Second Military Subdistrict Military Commission awarded 20 landmines to the Shouyang militia, who created the example of landmine combined with sniping warfare, to encourage them, and issued a circular of commendation to the militias of Shouyang and Taigu.

    保卫群众春耕生产
    【太行消息】我寿阳、太谷民兵积极活动，连打胜仗，保卫群众春耕生产，受到二分区武委会奖励表扬。上月十五日，驻寿阳草沟阎匪四十九师一百多人，到我路南三泾村抢粮，该村民兵早有准备，事先把地雷埋好，发现敌人后，即掩护全村群众安全转移，又立即配合轮防队一部，用冷枪引诱敌人入洞。敌中我民兵埋伏，地雷开花、结合冷枪，共歼灭敌人十三名、夺回被敌抢去的群众粮食五石、羊四十多只、衣服一百多件。敌人急忙逃窜。十六日，榆次李ｙàｎ＠①阎匪一百多名又到我寿阳路北段廷抢劫，我路南长岭、云烟两村民兵得讯，马上赶去冲击，歼敌五名，夺回粮食、衣服各一部。敌不支，狼狈败退。以上两次战斗，我民兵毫无伤亡。另一次，驻太谷的阎匪，从十五日到十八日，用三个团的兵力向我三区腹地官寨、念沟一带进行合击，该区民兵事先就在庞庄到官寨一条沟内埋了几十颗地雷。当敌进犯时，一共踏响二十多颗，对敌杀伤很大（战果待查）。对保卫春耕生产，起了很大作用，群众对民兵非常拥护。我二分区武委会对创造地雷结合冷枪战范例的寿阳民兵，奖给地雷二十颗，以资鼓励，并对寿阳、太谷民兵通报表扬。
