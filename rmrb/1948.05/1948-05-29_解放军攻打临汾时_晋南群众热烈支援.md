From Taiyue, 22nd. During the battle to liberate Linfen, the masses enthusiastically supported the front lines. From the rear, as far as hundreds of miles away, to the newly liberated urban areas, the masses wholeheartedly helped the People's Liberation Army. Zhang Xiang Village stipulated that each person should send 40 catties of firewood to the troops. Yang Qishi said, "One trip for our troops is worth one trip for ourselves," and he carried 95 catties in one load. Zhai Wuyi from Fushan Village, seeing the continuous heavy rain and fearing it would delay grinding flour, moved the millstone to his home. Under his influence, twelve millstones in the village were buzzing at that time. They pointed to the sky triumphantly and said, "Even if it rains, we won't delay grinding flour for the troops." To make it easier for the troops to buy vegetables, the masses automatically concentrated vegetables to the market. In Dengzhuang Town alone, from March 8th to 17th, women and children sent 140,000 catties of vegetables. Although there were many soldiers buying vegetables, the price of bean sprouts dropped from 100 yuan per catty to 80 yuan per catty. Chen Gencheng, who carried vegetables, said, "Even if we don't eat vegetables, we have to send them to our troops." When the news that the front needed door panels to repair fortifications reached Zhang Zuan Village in Xiangling, Zhang Jinlou knew that without door panels, the front could not fight. He immediately said, "Even without an official order, take my door first." Before the official notice arrived, the masses had automatically sent a pile of door panels. The task of delivering materials, which was originally scheduled to be completed in ten days by Dongguo Village in Xiangling, was completed in three days. With the enthusiastic support of the masses, the troops did not feel any difficulty in supply. Everyone deeply understood what people's war meant.

　　解放军攻打临汾时
  　晋南群众热烈支援
    【本报太岳二十二日电】解放临汾战役中，群众热烈支援前线，从远至几百里的后方，直至新解放的城关地区，群众都竭诚帮助解放军。张相村规定给部队送柴每人担四十斤，杨七十说：“给咱队伍送一回要顶一回”，他一担就担了九十五斤。浮山村的翟武义看着大雨连绵，怕误了磨面，就把磨子搬在家里，在他的影响推动下，当时村中就有十二盘磨子在家中隆隆的响起来了，他们得意的指着天空说：“你下雨，俺也误不了给部队磨面。”为了部队买菜方便，群众自动把菜蔬集中到集市，仅邓庄镇三月八号到十七号九天中，妇女儿童送去菜蔬达十四万斤。虽然部队买菜的人很多，豆芽菜却由一百元一斤降到八十元一斤，担菜的陈根成说：“哪怕咱不吃菜也要给咱部队送哩。”前方要用门板修工事的消息传到襄陵张纂村，张进楼知道前方没门板就不能打仗，他立刻说：“没条子也行，先下我的门。”正式通知还没下来，群众就自动送去了一大堆门板。襄陵东郭村原来规定十天完成的送材料任务，他们三天就完成了。在群众热情支援下，部队未感到供应的困难，大家都深深体会到什么叫人民战争。
