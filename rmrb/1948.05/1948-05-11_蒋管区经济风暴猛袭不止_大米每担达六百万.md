Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to foreign news agency reports: The third economic storm in the Chiang-controlled areas this year is raging unabated. On the 6th, the price of rice in Shanghai rose again by 300,000 yuan (Chiang currency - hereinafter the same) compared to the 4th, reaching the 5 million mark, and on the 8th it rose further to 5.8 million yuan. The black market exchange rate for US dollars soared to 1.2 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the 5th. The price of gold also rose to 58 million yuan per tael. Shanghai's bureaucratic capitalists and imperialist financial circles in China are extremely panicked by this, fearing that "collapse is imminent" (Reuters). Li Lixia, head of the Chiang bandit's Shanghai Financial Control Bureau, also rushed to Nanjing to report the critical economic situation to Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit chieftain.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. According to foreign news agency reports: More than 4,000 rickshaw pullers in Nanjing held a general strike on the 5th to protest the unreasonable measures of rickshaw owners who increased the rent from 150,000 to 250,000 Chiang currency per day and increased the deposit to 4 million yuan. On the same day, more than a thousand rickshaw pullers gathered on Taiping Road, and then marched to the Chiang bandit's Social Bureau to petition. The strike ended in victory on the 6th. Rickshaws are now the main means of transportation in the bandit capital of Nanjing, and the strike paralyzed the city's transportation.

    蒋管区经济风暴猛袭不止
    大米每担达六百万
    【新华社陕北九日电】据外国通讯社消息：蒋区今年第三次经济风暴猛进不已。六日上海米价又较四日上升三十万元（蒋币——下同）而登五百万大关，八日更涨达五百八十万元。黑市美钞竟涨达一百二十万元，较五日又涨二十万元。黄金每两亦涨至五千八百万元。上海官僚资本及帝国主义在华金融界对此极感恐慌，深惧“崩溃将迫在眉睫”（路透社）。蒋匪上海金融管制局长李立侠亦匆忙赴宁向匪首蒋介石报告危急的经济局势。
    【新华社陕北八日电】据外国通讯社报导：南京四千余三轮车夫，于五日举行总罢工，反对车主将租金从每日蒋币十五万增至二十五万元及将押金加至四百万元之无理措施。当日千余车夫踏着三轮车在太平路集中，随即结队至蒋匪社会局请愿罢工已于六日获得胜利而结束。三轮车现为匪都南京之主要交通工具，此次罢工曾使该市交通为之瘫痪。
