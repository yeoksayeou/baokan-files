Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 3rd: Jin-Sui medical work has achieved great progress and success in the war. According to the recent summary of the border region's medical administrative meeting, the mortality rate of the wounded and sick in the entire region last year accounted for only two percent of the number admitted. The Lüliang Health Department's surgical team promptly performed surgery on the front lines, preventing wound suppuration in 80 percent of the wounded and achieving first-stage full recovery in 60 percent. Hospitals in Suiyuan-Mongolia and other places have self-made many traditional Chinese medicines, overcoming the difficulties of medicine shortages. The experimental institute has researched and produced tetanus antitoxin and other vaccines, making great contributions to the military and civilians. Medical personnel have all demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the wounded and sick. In emergency situations, medical personnel personally carried the wounded. Heroes and models have emerged everywhere. Medical personnel of a certain brigade in Suiyuan-Mongolia often participated in combat while simultaneously providing medical care and rescue. During the battle of Sumonkhk-monastery, a health worker from a certain unit saw a machine gunner being decorated, he immediately picked up the machine gun and repelled the enemy, and although wounded himself, he still rescued the wounded from danger. However, there are still serious shortcomings in the work of the whole region, such as the technical level has not been universally improved, some cadres are complacent, do not study their profession, neglect political study, have lax systems, and are divorced from the masses. The meeting has determined that the future policy is to overcome the view of simply relying on medication and not paying attention to treatment technology. The rear health departments should appropriately combine military and mass health, cultivate medical cadres, strictly enforce systems, practice strict economy, and establish a spirit of serving the wounded.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 3rd: The Jizhong Administrative Office has recently hired Mr. Duan Xuanhui, a famous doctor in the region, as the director of the Health Bureau of the Administrative Office. Mr. Duan said that he will widely unite medical colleagues to serve the military and civilians. Mr. Duan is 62 years old this year, studied in Japan, and taught internal medicine at Baoding Medical College. After the "July 7th Incident," he participated in the War of Resistance, and successively served as a professor at the Jizhong Military Region Health Training Team, consultant of the Military Region Health Department, and other positions.

    晋绥医务工作成绩很大
    在火线上及时动用手术
    【新华社晋绥三日电】晋绥医务工作在战争中获得很大进步和成绩，据最近召开的边区医务行政会议总结，去年全区伤病员死亡率，仅占收容数的百分之二。吕梁卫生部手术队，于火线上及时动用手术，使百分之八十的伤员伤口未化脓，百分之六十得到第一期全愈。绥蒙等地医院自制很多中药，克服了医药困难。试验所研究出破伤风抗毒素等疫苗，对军民贡献很大，医务人员都发扬了为伤病员服务的高度热情。在情况紧急下医务人员都亲自抬运伤员，各地英雄模范辈出。绥蒙某旅医务人员在战斗中常一面参加作战，一面医疗救护。某部卫生员在绥中蒙克寺战斗中，见一机枪手带花，他马上端起机枪把敌人打退，自己也负了伤，仍将伤员抢救出险。但全区工作中仍有严重缺点，技术未普遍提高，有些干部自满，不研究业务，忽视政治学习，制度不严，及脱离群众等现象。会议曾确定今后方针为克服单纯依靠用药，而不重视治疗技术的观点，后方卫生部门，应将军队和群众卫生适当结合，培养医务干部，严格制度，厉行节约，树立为伤员服务的精神。
    【新华社晋察冀三日电】冀中行署顷聘请该区名医段轩慧氏，任该署卫生局长。段氏称，渠将广泛联合医界同仁，为军民服务。段氏现年六十二岁，曾留学日本，并在保定医专任内科教职，“七七事变”后，参加抗战工作，历任冀中军区卫生教导队教授，军区卫生部顾问等职。
