　　Resolutely Implement Industrial and Commercial Policies
  　Yetao Fully Returns Property to Shops
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Central Bureau's policy of developing industry and commerce, the Yetao Town Business Association in the Ninth District of Wu'an has unconditionally returned all the goods confiscated from shops during the anti-feudal struggle last year to their original owners. When they initially convened meetings of shop managers, clerks, small business owners, and vendors throughout the town to discuss the return issue, some people were somewhat resistant, feeling that returning what had been eaten was embarrassing. However, later, based on their own experiences, everyone felt that doing so would benefit everyone. Over the past few years, merchants generally feared struggle, taking a laissez-faire attitude, and no one dared to expand their operations, or even simply closed their doors and stopped doing business. As a result, the market became increasingly depressed. Last autumn's anti-feudal struggle further shrunk commerce, and even shops and vendors who were not landlords or rich peasants became fearful. Now, with this return, everyone dares to operate boldly. After the ideological issues were largely clarified, the Business Association, led by Li Busheng, Wang Tanglin, Zhang Xinghan, Ji Yongzhi, Zhang Zhenru, and others, took charge of the return. The working method was as follows: goods that had been confiscated but not yet distributed or that had been converted into mass shares (i.e., changing the gods but not the temple) were returned to their original owners as they were. For goods that had been priced at the time of confiscation, compensation was paid according to the price at that time; for damaged or consumed goods, compensation was paid according to their value. A total of one Jia Shilin pharmacy, worth 438,000+ yuan, was returned, along with 460,000+ yuan in cash. Stored grain valued at 56,000+ yuan was returned. One Li Delu grocery store, worth 183,000 yuan, was returned, along with 87,700 yuan in cash. One Wei Zhiting flour mill and one dye shop, each, were returned, along with 167,400 yuan in cash. 330,000 yuan was returned to Li Chunze. One Fuhelong general merchandise and dye shop received 400,000 yuan. The luggage, clothing, and other items of the sixty-eight shop clerks who had been confiscated were all returned. The implementation of this policy has stabilized the morale of the town's merchants. Some of the original owners who received their property back have already started business, while others are preparing to open, and plan to expand their operations. Merchants who were not struggled against feel very satisfied and plan to continue to expand their businesses. Responsible comrades of the Business Association said that this market will be able to restore its prosperity this autumn.

　　坚决执行工商业政策
  　冶陶全部退还商店财物
    【本报消息】武安九区冶陶镇商联会根据中央局发展工商业政策，已将去年挤封建时所没收的商店货物全部无条件退还原业主。他们在开始召集全镇商店经理、店员、小商人、摊贩等开会研究退还问题时，曾有些人思想稍有抵抗，认为吃啥吐啥，脸上有些下不来。但后来大家根据切身经验，感到这样做对大家都有利益。几年以来，商人当中普遍存在着怕斗争的思想，得过且过，谁也不敢扩大经营，甚至干脆关门，停止营业。因此市场日趋萧条。去年秋天一挤封建，商业越发萎缩，不是地主富农的商店、摊贩也跟着害怕起来。现在这样一退还，就都敢大胆经营了。思想大体弄通后，即由商联会李步升、王唐林、张兴汉、吉永智、张珍如等负责退还，工作办法是：没收后尚未分配的和转作群众股份（即换神不换庙的），原封退还原业主。当时货物已作价的，按当时作价赔偿；损坏消耗的，按价赔偿。共计退回贾士林药铺一座，价值四十三万八千余元，退现款四十六万余元。存粮作价五万六千余元。李德禄杂货铺一座，价值十八万三千元，现款八万七千七百元。魏治廷面坊、染坊各一座，现款十六万七千四百元。李春泽三十三万元。复和隆杂货颜料庄一座，款四十万元。被没收的六十八个店员，已将他们行李、衣服等件全部退回。这一政策的实施，使全镇商人情绪稳定。退回的原业主，有的已开始营业，有的正在筹备开张，并拟扩大经营。未斗争的商人，感到十分满意，打算把买卖继续扩大。商联会负责同志表示，今年秋天，该市场即可恢复繁荣。
