Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 22nd. Under the call and encouragement of the democratic government to "hunt on mountains to protect grain," the masses in various places have launched hunting activities, and "mountain hunting heroes" have emerged. Near Shuitou Town, Xi County, nearly 500 shi of grain are trampled by wild animals every year, accounting for one-third of the harvest. From spring to autumn, the peasants fight against wild animals every night by burning fires and beating gongs. Wang Jingcheng, a peasant in the town, has been actively hunting since October last year. By February of this year, he had killed a total of thirty-three wild boars of various sizes (and dissected over a hundred piglets from their bellies), one wolf, one fox, two leopards, and one roe deer. Wang specially sent a leopard skin to General He Long. General He Long replied with a letter of thanks and "hoped that more people would be like you, striving to eliminate all wild beasts, birds, and pests that harm the production of the masses." Wang Jingcheng has now formed a ten-one-person hunting team and has gone to Chuan Kou at the request of the masses to eliminate the pack of wolves that has injured more than twenty people. Peasants in Fangshan, Baode, Xingxian, Guoxian and other places are also actively hunting on the mountains. Li Renxin, a poor peasant in Xingxian, killed seven large wild boars in just seven days.
