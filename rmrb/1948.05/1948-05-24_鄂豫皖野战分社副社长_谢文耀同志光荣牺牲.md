　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd】Comrade Xie Wenyao, Deputy Director of our Eyuwan Field Branch, gloriously died in the line of duty. Comrade Wenyao was ordered to establish local news operations in the Eyu liberated area around December of last year, and temporarily left the field army to participate in land reform work in a certain village. He was as close as family with the local masses, which deeply angered the Kuomintang bandit army. On February 13th, when Chiang's bandits "swept" the area, Comrade Wenyao persisted in fighting with the local masses. On February 15th, while returning to work in the stationed village, he was unfortunately surrounded by nearby bandit troops and local landlord armed forces. Comrade Wenyao immediately resisted heroically, but unfortunately was shot in the waist and captured. He remained steadfast and unyielding, and gloriously sacrificed himself. The local masses were shocked and grieved upon hearing the news. All comrades in the Central Plains press circles expressed their deep condolences. The head office sent a telegram to the branch expressing condolences and encouraging the news workers in the Central Plains to inherit Comrade Wenyao's legacy, turn grief into strength, and continue to strive for the creation of revolutionary news operations in the area between the Yangtze River and the Huai River. Comrade Wenyao was from Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, 32 years old this year, a member of the Communist Party. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the Deputy Director of the "July 7th Daily" in the Central Plains Liberated Area. After the start of the revolutionary war, he broke through and headed north with the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army. When the People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive last summer, he served as the Deputy Director of the Eyuwan Field Branch, followed Liu and Deng's army south, and participated in the work of establishing the Dabie Mountains base area. He was consistently proactive and responsible, amiable and approachable, and was always respected and loved by his comrades and colleagues. Comrade Wenyao's wife, Comrade Liu Jian, is currently working at the head office with their young son. The head office has expressed its condolences and provided appropriate compensation. In addition: Front-line photographer Liu Baozhang, gloriously sacrificed himself in the second capture of Deng County earlier this month. At the start of the battle, Liu went deep into the front lines to take photos and conduct interviews, actively wrote articles for the battlefield regimental newspaper, and participated in the assault company to help mobilize and encourage the troops. At the start of the general attack on the afternoon of the 8th, Comrade Liu Baozhang followed the first echelon in the attack and unfortunately suffered serious injuries and died in front of the breakthrough. The head office has sent a telegram of condolence.
