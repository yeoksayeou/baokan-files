　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st: The People's Liberation Army, in pursuit of the fleeing enemy from Yan'an and Luochuan, annihilated a complete regiment and an artillery battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops of the 61st Brigade (note: the 61st Brigade was hastily reorganized after being annihilated southwest of Yichuan) on the Wu Zhuang section of the Luo (chuan) Bai (shui) highway on the afternoon of April 27th, seizing eight field guns. Detailed battle results are still being tallied. Our troops are continuing to relentlessly pursue them. From April 23rd to 25th, the Liberation Army captured over 600 fleeing enemy from Luochuan north of Wu Zhuang, and annihilated over 120 fleeing enemy from Yan'an south of Lu County. Nine large carts fully loaded with supplies, over twenty boxes of bullets, over ninety rounds of field artillery shells, and a portion of military flour were captured.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd: In the battle to capture Baoji, a strategically important town in the Northwest, on April 26th, Xu Bao, the commander of the 76th Division of Chiang's bandits, was seriously wounded and captured by our forces. He was immediately given treatment, but due to excessive blood loss, he died on April 27th. The People's Liberation Army has properly collected and buried his remains at the northern end of Baoji Airport, and a wooden sign has been erected to mark the spot, so that Xu's family can come to claim the body. Xu was from Zhangjiakou, and was 41 years old. After the 76th Division was annihilated and its commander, Liao Ang, was captured in the Battle of Qingjian last October, Xu was promoted to this position, and was a trusted confidant of Hu Zongnan's bandits.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd: Preliminary battle results of the Liberation Army's liberation of Qishan, Fengxiang, and Caijiapo, Guozhen from April 23rd to 25th: over 370 enemy security police were captured, three machine guns, over 200 rifles and carbines, 15,000 shih of military wheat, and a portion of other military supplies were seized.

    【新华社西北一日电】解放军追击延安、洛川两城逃敌，四月二十七日下午于洛（川）白（水）公路间之吴庄歼蒋胡匪六一旅一个整团又一个炮兵营（按六一旅系宜川西南被歼后重新拚凑者），缴获野炮八门，详细战果正清查中。我军现仍继续跟踪猛追。自四月二十三日至二十五日解放军即在吴庄北俘洛川逃敌六百余，并在鹿县南歼延安逃敌一百二十余人。缴获满载物资之大车九辆，子弹二十余箱，野炮弹九十余发，军面一部。
    【新华社西北二日电】解放军上月二十六日攻占西北战略重镇宝鸡战斗中，蒋匪七六师师长徐保负重伤为我俘获，当即给以治疗，但因流血过多，于二十七日毙命。解放军已妥为收殓，安葬于宝鸡飞机场北端，并立有木牌为记，以便徐之家属前去领尸。徐系张家口人，现年四十一岁，去年十月清涧之役，七六师被歼，师长廖昂被俘后，徐乃调升该职，为胡匪宗南得力亲信。
    【新华社西北二日电】解放军上月二十三至二十五日解放岐山、凤翔及蔡家坡、虢镇之初步战果：俘敌保警队三百七十余人、缴获机枪三挺、长短枪二百余支、军麦一万五千石，其他军用物资一部。
