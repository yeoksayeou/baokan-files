    Yan's Bandits from Jinzhong Invading Were Beaten Back
    Enemy Strongholds Cleared in the Central Section of the Jiaoji Railway
    On May 9th, the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army, between Shouyang and Meng County north of the Zhengtai Railway, annihilated the Yan bandit's Provisional 49th Division's direct subordinate units and most of the 1st Regiment, and part of the 3rd Regiment, which were invading north from Shouyang. Zhang Yi, the bandit's 34th Army Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander, concurrently Commander of the 49th Division, and Zhao Junyi, the division's Major General Deputy Commander, were captured alive. Over 2,000 bandits were killed or captured. We took advantage of the victory to capture Shouyang and Zong'ai Town to its northwest, and pursued the fleeing remnants towards the northwest. On May 1st, we pointed out that the Yan bandits were gathering troops in the Shouyang area. If they dared to brazenly harass us, they would be met with a head-on blow. The result was that they were soundly beaten as soon as they showed their faces.
    On April 22nd, our army recaptured Tianjia Town, northeast of Changle, in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, annihilating over 1,300 bandits. On May 1st, we recaptured Cangshang Town, southwest of Changle. By this point, the remaining strongholds of Chiang's bandits in the Changwei'an area were completely eliminated. Our local soldiers and civilians actively cooperated with the main force in combat, annihilating the routed scattered bandits one by one. From April 13th to 29th, nearly 3,000 fleeing enemies and local Chiang's forces were annihilated and captured continuously in the areas of Anqiu, Yidu, Changle, and south of Fangzi. At the same time, the military and civilians in southern Shandong also cooperated in combat, annihilating over 1,000 bandits in the outer areas of Linyi and the suburbs of Ju County. On the 2nd, the Binhai local armed forces intercepted the enemy fleeing south from Anqiu southwest of Ju County, killing, wounding, and capturing Wang Pizhou, the Major Battalion Commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Anqiu Self-Defense Column, and others, totaling over 1,500. From mid-April to the end of the month, the Huazhong local armed forces successively captured many bandit strongholds in the Jingjiang and Taixing areas, including Tuqiao, Baimuqiao, Maqiao, Guanjiaqiao north of Tai County, Huitangou north of Lingbi, and Lingtangqiao east of Tianchang. They also repelled the harassment of the bandit's 21st Division and Provisional 23rd Division in the suburbs of Rugao, annihilating and capturing over 1,200 enemies, including Li Yi, the commander of the 434th Regiment. The Taiyue military and civilians of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu on the 3rd recovered the city of Shaanxi County on the Longhai Railway, as well as many stations such as Guanyintang, Cishi, and Zhangmao between Mianchi and Shaanxi County, annihilating over 140 enemies, including Shi Xingmin, the deputy commander of the Shaanxi County Self-Defense General Team. The local armed forces of Ji-Lu-Yu on the south bank of the Yellow River were extremely active, successively annihilating a total of over 1,700 bandits from the 70th Division, 80th Division, and other units in Jinxiang, Kaocheng, Pingyin, and other places.
    On the 17th of last month, the local armed forces of Yu-Wan-Su recovered Taikang, and on the 2nd of this month, they recaptured Shangcai, and pursued and annihilated the local Chiang's Weichuan Self-Defense General Team that had fled to Erlangdian north of Changge city. Guerrilla warfare in E-Yu-Wan and Yu-Shaan-E continued to unfold fiercely, with repeated victories.
    In mid-April, the local armed forces of Liaoji in Northeast China repelled the harassment of the bandit cavalry's 1st and 3rd Brigades in the areas of Shifosi, Sanglinzi, and Sanmianchuan on the outskirts of Shenyang, annihilating over 800 enemies. On the 4th, the local armed forces of eastern Rehe severely attacked the enemy harassing from Suizhong, killing and capturing over 200 bandits and puppets.
    On the 1st, the local armed forces of the first sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia cleared the two remaining enemy strongholds of Heishuisi and Anjiachuan in ＠ County. The entire territory of the Yan-Shu sub-district is now liberated.
