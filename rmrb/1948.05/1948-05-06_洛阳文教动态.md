Luoyang Cultural and Educational Developments

　　(1) The first book published in Luoyang after its liberation was Chairman Mao's report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks." (2) The various drama troupes of the People's Liberation Army organized a joint drama society and performed for the citizens for six consecutive days starting on the 17th. The repertoire included "Blood and Tears of Hatred," "The White-Haired Girl," "Military-Civilian Mutual Assistance," "Merit List," and "The Fool." When a certain unit's cultural troupe performed "Returning the Donkey" at the Military-Civilian Club on the 11th, an old gentleman in the audience said with emotion, "Last time the Central Army arrested my servant and seized my donkey. I spent 300,000 yuan to get it back. How could they return the donkey?" (3) The Municipal Government's Bureau of Culture and Education established a joint middle school based on the original Luozhong, Luoshi, and Agricultural Technology schools, with middle school, normal school, and vocational departments. Preparations for the opening of the school are now underway. (4) The printing workers of the New Luoyang Daily mostly worked in the Jiang bandit's official newspapers. Now their living conditions have improved, and they have established their own trade union, so their work enthusiasm is very high.
