Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 6th: Before the liberation of Weixian City, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits engaged in arson and looting, causing heavy losses to the residents. Over 3,000 industrial, commercial, and residential buildings were destroyed inside and outside the city. Hundreds of businesses on the North and South Ba Ya Streets have been reduced to rubble. The Fuju Xiang Tea House, with assets worth hundreds of millions of Chiang Kai-shek's currency, has been completely reduced to ashes. The well-known Yulu Dye Company, Huafeng Iron Factory, Xinfeng Textile Factory, and North China Tobacco Company, all large-scale industrial and commercial enterprises, were completely looted except for their heavy machinery. Dozens of private factories on South Guan Damalu, such as Tianxing Electric Sawmill and Lidong Iron Factory, had their houses completely destroyed and most of their machinery damaged. Weixian City, formerly known as an industrial city, has been completely disfigured, and approximately 20,000 to 30,000 residents have lost their jobs and been displaced. In recent days, Chiang Kai-shek's planes have indiscriminately bombed the area. The democratic government is now making every effort to provide rescue.

　　潍县蒋匪被歼前  烧毁民房三千家
    【新华社华东前线六日电】潍县城解放前遭蒋匪纵火劫掠，居民损失惨重，城内外工商建筑与民房被毁者达三千余家。南北坝崖街之数百家商号已成一片瓦砾，资财值数亿元蒋币之福聚祥茶庄，已完全化为灰烬。著名的裕鲁染料公司、华丰铁工厂、信丰染织厂、华北烟草公司等规模较大之工商企业，除笨重机器外，余亦荡然无存。南关大马路之天兴电力锯木厂、利东铁工厂等数十家民营厂商，房屋全毁，机器亦多半损坏，向称工业都市之潍县城已面目全非，居民失业与流离失所者约两三万人。连日来蒋匪飞机又滥施轰炸，现民主政府正竭力抢救中。
