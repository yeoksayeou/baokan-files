    Dongzigou Returns Confiscated Middle Peasant Shares
    Middle Peasants Buy Sesame Cakes and Go to the Fields
    [Changzhi News] When the masses in Dongzigou Village, Third District, first heard our propaganda about the Land Law Outline and the policies towards all classes, and that middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against would definitely be compensated, they were generally skeptical. Some people said: "Last year they said there would be no struggle, but in the end, after the autumn harvest, some middle peasants were struggled against. Anyway, whoever has something will be unlucky. Why bother with production? Just gathering enough firewood for the day is enough." Everyone was still not enthusiastic about production. Recently, after the Production Committee held a meeting to examine and discuss the issue, everyone felt that the main reason was that they were only paying lip service and not taking practical action, so the masses did not believe them. Therefore, they checked the targets of struggle household by household. At that time, it was revealed that twelve households of middle peasants had been wrongly struggled against. When squeezing out feudal elements last autumn, all their shares were confiscated and are still kept in the farmers' association. They should be returned immediately. The next night, a mass meeting was immediately convened, and the leaders admitted the mistake of struggling against the middle peasants, explaining that when squeezing out feudal elements last autumn, other villages were doing it, so we followed suit. If there were no big feudal elements, there would be small feudal elements, and whoever had something would be struggled against. As a result, the shares of twelve households of middle peasants were all confiscated. These twelve households had no exploitation. They were struggled against only because of trivial matters. For example, they had sold Jindan medicine for a few days in the past, or sheltered landlord relatives, served in the security team, had disharmonious families, engaged in business, served as deputy village chief under the puppet regime for a few days, were fond of prostitution, or their fathers had exploited people. One household could not be found to have done anything wrong, even after tracing back three generations. They mobilized activists to go to his house and persuade him, saying, "Take out your shares. If you don't take them out, be careful of being dealt with." This household was so frightened that they handed over all their shares. After the village cadres made such a detailed examination and admitted their mistakes, they asked everyone to discuss in groups how to correct and compensate. An old man of sixty said, "If these twelve households can be corrected, it is truly Chairman Mao's leadership, and the clear sky is speaking the truth. They all worked hard to get where they are and did not exploit anyone at all. The shares should be returned to them in full immediately." (Cadres should educate the masses that even if there is some slight exploitation, they should not be struggled against indiscriminately - Editor) Then, more than a dozen poor peasants and hired laborers who had never spoken out also said that the shares should be returned to the people immediately. Only the poor peasant Wang Dui objected, saying, "When squeezing out feudal elements, we offended people, and now we have to return things to them!" Before he finished speaking, the poor peasant Shi Tou said, "We should return it to them. It was earned with their blood and sweat, and they didn't exploit us." The masses argued very enthusiastically. Since the issue was not resolved that day, everyone was asked to deliberate in their mutual aid groups. A mass meeting was convened on the third day, and each group reported. As a result, the unanimous opinion of each group was to return all the shares to these twelve households. On the spot, the middle peasant Yang Chouhong said, "If you return my shares to me, I will buy a draught animal, which will benefit me and also benefit our village." Some said they would buy farm tools, and some wanted to buy sesame cakes to fertilize the fields. 3,500 catties of sesame cakes have now been bought, and the middle and poor peasants are very motivated to produce. The manure that the middle peasant Yang Chouhong had not delivered for three years has now also been delivered to the fields. These days they are rushing to sow seeds. In the neighboring village of Caojiagou, there is a middle peasant who sold his livestock in the past, fearing struggle. This time, upon hearing this news, he regretted selling his livestock.

    洞子沟退还没收中农股金
    中农买油饼上地
    【长治消息】三区洞子沟村群众开始听到我们宣传土地法大纲与对各阶级政策，说斗错中农一定要补偿时，一般都是半信半疑。有人说：“去年说不斗啦，结果秋后把些中农都斗争了。反正谁有谁倒霉，生产什么哩，一天打柴够一天烧就行了。”大家生产都还是不起劲。最近经过生产委员会开会检查讨论，大家感到主要原因是光说嘴，不实做，群众不相信。于是一户户检查斗争对象。当时提出来错斗了十二户中农。去年秋后挤封建时，把人家股金全部没收了，现在还在农会存着，应该马上退还。第二天黑夜马上召开群众大会，领导上承认了斗争中农的错误，说明去年秋后挤封建时，其他村都挤开了，咱也就跟着挤。没有大封建，总有小封建，谁有就斗谁，结果把十二户中农的股金全部没收了。这十二户都没有剥削，只因零碎事故就被斗了。如过去卖过几天金丹，或者包庇了一下地主亲戚，当过保安队，家庭不和气，做过买卖，当过几天伪村副，好嫖，或老子剥削过人等。有一户找不出一点事实，追三代也追不出来剥削，就发动积极分子去他家动员说：“把你的股金拿出来吧。你要不拿出来，防备吃家伙。”吓的这户把股金全交出来了。村干部这样详细做了检查，并承认了是自己的错后，就叫大家分组讨论如何纠正、补偿。一个六十岁老汉说：“这十二户要能纠正，这真是毛主席领导，青天说真理。人家都是自己劳动起来的，并没有一点剥削，应该马上原数退给人家。”（干部应教育群众，就是有点轻微剥削，也不能一概斗争——编者）接着有十几个一贯不说话的贫雇也都说应该马上把股金退给人家。只有贫农王堆只反对说：“挤封建时咱得罪下人，今天又要给他退哩！”话音还没落下，就有贫农石头说：“应该给人家退。人家一点血一点汗受来的，又不是剥削咱。”群众争论得很热闹。当天没有解决，就叫大家到互助组里酝酿。第三天召开群众大会，各组会报。结果各组一致意见是把这十二户的股金全部退回。当场中农杨丑红说：“大家给我退出股金，我要买一个牲口，对我有利，对咱村上也有利。”有的说要买农具，有的要买油饼上地。现已买到油饼三千五百斤，中贫农生产劲头都很大。中农杨丑红三年未送的粪，现在也送到地了。这几天正突击下种。邻村曹家沟有一户中农，过去卖了牲口，怕斗争，这次听到这个消息，又后悔不该卖牲口来。          （张仁才、范够群）
