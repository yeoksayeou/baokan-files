Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 11th. The private textile industry in southwestern Shanxi was once highly developed, but it was brought to a standstill by the Yan bandit's years of plunder. The democratic governments of nine counties, including Xi County, Fenxi, and Daning, have provided interest-free loans of 172,000 catties of cotton to help restore production. Now, spinning wheels and looms have been widely started everywhere. After Xiangxiang and Nuanquantou and other four villages in Fenxi lent 7,000 catties of cotton, more than 700 textile women were involved in the textile craze. After Dangzhi Village, Daning, borrowed 1,300 catties of cotton, it has woven more than 100 bolts of cloth and purchased more than 4,000 catties of rice. Various places have also helped the women of landlords and rich peasants solve the difficulties of tools and organized and urged them to carry out textile production.

    晋西南贷棉十七万斤
    帮助发展民间纺织业
    【新华社晋绥十一日电】晋西南民间纺织业原极发达，但因阎匪多年掠夺而陷于停顿。隰县、汾西、大宁等九县民主政府特无利贷棉十七万二千斤，帮助恢复生产。现各地纺车织机已普遍开动。汾西＠香、暖泉头等四村贷花七千斤，七百余纺织妇女即卷入纺织热潮。大宁当支村贷到一千三百斤棉花后，已织出布百余匹，购米四千余斤，各地并帮助地主富农妇女解决工具之困难，组织督促其进行纺织生产。
