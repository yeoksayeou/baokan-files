    Change Grouping by Area
    Yan Shan Improves Mutual Aid
    [Taiyue News] Since Yan Shan Village in the sixth district of Yangcheng voluntarily combined for mutual aid, they plowed and sowed over 1,000 mu of valley land in just nine days. They also planted 54 mu of cotton, 87 mu of miscellaneous crops, leveled 391 mu of land, and hoed most of the wheat fields. In addition, a small group of people seized the spare time to carry bowls and jars to the west to exchange for salt, engaging in transportation to solve difficulties. In the past, the village's mutual aid teams were formed based on terrain, forcing people with conflicting ideas to work together. The groups had large plots of land but small fields, and much of the work was done by laborers. When planning work, the cadres and team leaders would decide, and everyone would follow. Now, it's entirely based on individual willingness; whoever is like-minded with whom joins in mutual aid. The whole village has formed 44 groups. In addition to mutual aid among middle and poor peasants, they have also planned to absorb landlords and rich peasants, urging them to work. Furthermore, women also join the groups with their husbands, receiving the same work points and having the freedom to withdraw. With democratic leadership, everyone discusses the work, and everyone decides on matters. Each group gathers together after dinner at night to record work points and decide on the next day's work. Therefore, everyone is working with more and more energy. The team leaders also find it easier to lead.

    改变按片编组
    岩山搞好互助
    【太岳消息】阳城六区岩山村自愿结合互助，九天就把全村一千多亩谷地犁种完了。又种棉花五十四亩，杂田八十七亩，垒＠三百九十一亩，麦地也多半锄过。另外一小部分人又抓紧空闲时间，担上碗和缸去西边换盐，搞运输，解决困难。这村互助组过去按地形结合，心思不合的人也就不得不弄到一块。组大地块小，做活背工多。在计划做活时，由干部小组长主张，大家跟着干。现在完全按各人自愿，谁和谁心投意合，就互助在一块。全村共结合四十四个组，除中贫农互助外，还有计划的吸收了地主富农参加，督促他们劳动。另外，妇女也随自己男人参加进组，同样打分，又可以自由退出。领导上民主了，有活大家讨论，有事大家决定，各组在黑夜吃饭后就集合在一起记分，决定明天的活。所以大家越干越有劲。组长也觉得好领导了。
