Under the leadership of the Communist Party, Greek youth continue to fight for the independence and democratization of Greece. Seventy percent of the soldiers in the Greek Democratic Army are young people, and some units of the Democratic Army are entirely organized by members of the Greek Democratic Youth League. The Youth League has also undertaken the important task of restoring agriculture and industry and improving culture in the liberated areas. In their recent letter to the youth of Greek cities and villages, they called on young people to fight to drive out foreign imperialists. This call has aroused widespread response among young men and women across the country (including those in the government army), and hundreds of young men and women are joining the Democratic Army every day.
