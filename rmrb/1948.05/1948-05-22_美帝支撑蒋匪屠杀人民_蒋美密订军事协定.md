　　American Imperialism Supports Chiang Kai-shek's Slaughter of the People
  　Chiang and the U.S. Secretly Conclude Military Agreement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th] Reliable sources in Shanghai reveal: The U.S.-Chiang military agreement that Marshall announced to the U.S. Senate on February 28th, 1945, is only part of that agreement. It is understood that other parts of the agreement include the U.S. government being responsible for equipping 75 divisions of the Chiang army before 1950, supplying the Chiang army with 750 mountain guns, 1,500 light cannons, 5,000 mortars, 12,000 heavy machine guns, 17,000 light machine guns, 600,000 automatic rifles, and 250 warships (including 3 cruisers and 45 destroyers). The agreement also stipulates that before the end of 1948, the U.S. government should hand over 330 light and heavy cannons to the Chiang army. The agreement promises to hand over the military surplus materials existing on the Pacific islands to the Chiang government, and the U.S. will transport these materials to Chinese ports at a rate of 60,000 tons per month. According to the content of the 1945 U.S.-Chiang military agreement that Marshall announced in February this year, it only mentioned that the United States should supply the Chiang government with 8 and 1/3 air squadrons, namely one heavy bomber squadron, one medium bomber squadron, four single-engine bomber squadrons, two military transport squadrons, and one small reconnaissance squadron, totaling 1,071 aircraft, of which at least 936 have reportedly been delivered to the Chiang government. The agreement also stipulates that the United States should train 5,137 air force personnel for the Chiang army to use these aircraft.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th] According to a New York Times dispatch from Nanjing on April 9, the U.S. military advisory group has put forward extensive demands to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, including: 1. Advisory power for overall staff planning; 2. Operational advisory power; 3. Sending advisors and liaison officers to the battlefield to supervise the implementation of operational plans; 4. Fully training the Chiang army, especially junior officers; 5. Managing military equipment and military supplies. The fact that the Chiang army is obeying the command of the American imperialists is becoming increasingly apparent and is increasingly arousing the indignation of Chiang's officers and soldiers.

　　美帝支撑蒋匪屠杀人民
  　蒋美密订军事协定
    【新华社陕北二十日电】上海可靠方面消息透露：马歇尔在二月二十八日向美国参院宣布的一九四五年美蒋军事协定，只是该协定的一部分；据悉，该协定之其他部分，包括美政府负责在一九五○年以前装备蒋军七十五个师，供给蒋军山炮七百五十门，轻炮一千五百门，迫击炮五千门，重机枪一万二千挺，轻机枪一万七千挺，自动步枪六十万支，军舰二百五十艘（内巡洋舰三艘，驱逐舰四十五艘）。协定中并规定在一九四八年底以前，美政府应交给蒋军轻重炮三百三十门。该协定允诺将现存太平洋各岛的军用剩余物资交给蒋政府，并由美方以每月六万吨的速度代运这些物资到中国海口。按马歇尔在今年二月所已宣布的一九四五年美蒋军事协定的内容中，只提及美国应供给蒋政府空军八又三分之一机队，即一队重轰炸机，一队中型轰炸机，四队单引擎轰炸机，二队军事运输机，一小队侦察机，总数为一千零七十一架，其中至少有九百三十六架据宣布业已运交蒋政府。该协定并规定美国应为蒋军训练空军人员五千一百三十七人，以使用这些飞机。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据纽约时报四月九日南京电，美军事顾问团已向蒋匪提出广泛要求，包括一、统筹全局的参谋计划的顾问权；二、作战顾问权；三、派顾问联络员到战场监督作战计划的实施；四、充分训练蒋军，尤其是下级军官；五、管理军事配备和军事供应。蒋军听命于美帝国主义者指挥的这个事实，正在日益表面化，并日益引起蒋军官兵的愤慨。
