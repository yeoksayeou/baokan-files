Our "Pravda"
Translated by Luo Fen

    This article is by the Soviet writer Konstantin Simonov, written for the commemoration of the 10,000th issue of "Pravda," and was published in "Red Star" on September 25, 1945. The article describes how to be an excellent journalist and correspondent for a Party newspaper, and how "Pravda" worked heroically and fearlessly in the Great Patriotic War of Self-Defense. We publish this article to educate Party newspaper workers and fellow correspondents, and also for the vast number of readers to learn how to seriously treat the revolutionary cause and how to treat the work of Party newspapers and supervise them with correct standards.
          ——Editor
    Often, we don't think much about the real meaning of very common words. We routinely open the newspaper every day, and on the masthead are two words – "Truth" ["Pravda" in Russian], and we don’t use our brains much on this name. But apart from this, it is difficult to find a simpler, more powerful, and more correct word to be the name of this newspaper. Just like the staff of any newspaper, the staff of "Pravda" is composed of all kinds of people: writers, journalists, correspondents, interviewers, artists, photographers. But the two words printed on this masthead – "Truth" [Truthfulness] – unites all these, often diverse, people, establishing a common direction, common principles, and a common working style.

    In our lives, in the biggest and smallest things, truth is important. We are the most steadfast seekers of truth on earth, and we dedicate our whole lives to the struggle for truth and justice to prevail on earth.

    Therefore, naturally and without question, the organ of the Central Committee of our All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) can only be and should be called these unique two words – "Truth."

    But great truth (truthfulness) is accumulated from many small truths (truthfulness). Therefore, in all circumstances, seeking truth – first and foremost truth and only truth – has become an unconditional prerequisite for everyone working in "Pravda." Even if it is a small news item published on the last page of the newspaper, or if it is a serious editorial estimating the situation in the grim days of the battle around Moscow – the same, ultimately, must conform to the same principled standard: it should be true, from head to toe true.

    In such difficult and arduous conditions of the war to defend the motherland, under frontline conditions, pursuing truth and wanting to explain everything accurately and objectively is difficult and often dangerous. In order to truthfully describe the war, it is necessary to personally see the war, and in order to personally see the war, it is necessary to endure the same dangers endured by the most direct participants in the war – the soldiers and officers on the front lines.

    For the war correspondents of "Pravda," no matter what difficulties they faced, the unchanging trait was to directly ascertain the truth of a matter.

    "Pravda" gave its correspondents some noble and difficult tasks, and many of these correspondents have heroically sacrificed their lives on the battlefield. A lot could be written about each of the deceased, but I want to first think of two people – two very different people, even their professions are different. But the newspaper they jointly represented on the front line, and their common style of action, will forever connect them. These are the world-famous writer Yevgeny Petrov and one of our most famous photojournalists – Mikhail Kalashnikov.

    During the war, I ran into them both more than once. These two people were not completely the same, but the common characteristics unique to "Pravda" reporters combined them. First of all, they were very serious people, always seriously thinking about everything, taking serious responsibility for their every word and every piece of work. In the words of a newspaper person, they were capable and strong characters with a persistent spirit.

    I remember on the Karelian front, I personally saw Yevgeny Petrov talking with soldiers and officers many times. He never looked for superficial feelings, and did not chase after unrealistic and easy impressions of conversations. He, the "Pravda" reporter, first wanted to know the truth. Braggarts, or truly brave people who liked to exaggerate their merits, could not deceive him.

    Petrov was good at discovering the most important, real, and living truth in people. Sometimes, after he had patiently listened to a round of boastful talk, he would say:

    ——No, I won’t write about this person.

    Conversely, he would patiently spend several hours with a silent person who was not very good at talking, carefully listening to all kinds of details that seemed to be the most trivial, and sense that this person was a true hero. He had to discover the truth in any case, and explain and express it with the most meticulous accuracy.

    In addition to the initiative of this outstanding person and writer, in his work, one could strongly feel that he had undergone a long period of professional training, and feel that he had worked in "Pravda" for many years. This work taught him how to deal with problems correctly; he had a sense of responsibility and obligation. And these were obtained through his serious work.

    When I discuss "Pravda," I think of Mikhail Kalashnikov, who was a photojournalist. This person always treated his work with the attitude of being first a communist, and as a person responsible for a large newspaper. The whole country knew the photos taken by Kalashnikov. These photos were unpretentious in even the smallest details, and were taken in real combat environments.

    The profession of photojournalist is a complex profession. It requires flexibility, the ability to adapt to the environment, and the ability to estimate whether the location and time are suitable for the needs of the newspaper when taking pictures of people.

    Kalashnikov was good at completing every task of the newspaper correctly and uncompromisingly. He would maintain his high self-esteem in the most complex situations, because he thought of himself as a representative of a newspaper, and this newspaper, no matter who he talked to about it, could not but be respected.

    In the serious days of the early war, in times of crisis, the frontline reporters of "Pravda" remained at their posts assigned by the newspaper. And the newspaper itself, in the grim days of October and November 1941, when the distant sound of artillery reached Moscow, still calmly stayed at its post, still on the same street as before, still in the building we all knew. As the front line approached Moscow, in those days, "Pravda" was closer to the front line than any frontline newspaper at other times. Bombs exploded across the street; incendiary bombs fell on the roof of the printing house; the explosions shook the glass in every editorial office and made it fly outwards. But "Pravda" was still being published.

    I remember these autumn and winter days very clearly. In this building, in addition to "Pravda," there were several other central newspapers. The reporters going to the front line could reach the front line in as little as fifty minutes, an hour, or an hour and a half; sometimes they ran to the front line twice in a day. The bombing never stopped, but every office still had such quiet lights burning, and at the scheduled time, entire editions of the newspaper were still being published without any deviation; it was still so meticulous, and every page of the newspaper had to go through several proofreadings by proofreaders and editors, because truth is important not only in huge events, but also in small things.

    The building that published the newspaper was full of contempt for the Germans. This proved that the proximity of the front line and Hitler's desperate offensive could not change any habits or common working styles of the editorial department in the slightest. The newspaper fully published the true words about the serious war situation, about the German offensive, and about the Germans approaching Moscow, but the newspaper itself was being published so calmly, as if it was a thousand kilometers away from its home.

    Certainly, after twenty or thirty years, we will flip through all the yellowed "Pravda" newspapers from the period of 1941, 42, and 43 with such excitement and respect, just as we now flip through all the "Pravda" newspapers from 1917, 18, and 19. Many things in the newspaper have passed, and many things are alive today and will die tomorrow. But when the newspaper is just, when it clearly, correctly, and bravely reflects its era, it itself is a history.

    During the war days, every page of "Pravda" called on people to rush to battle, telling people – "Persist!" "Keep moving forward!" Day after day, it told everything that the soldiers' hearts needed to hear. Every page of "Pravda" will become a chronological record of the great struggle – there is no doubt about this.

    "Pravda" has published 10,000 issues. Among these 10,000 issues, more than 1,000 issues were published during the years of the Patriotic War. All of us who have experienced this war today want to say: this is not simply more than 1,000 issues of the newspaper, this is the result of the active labor of all kinds of different people – writers and typesetters, interviewers and proofreaders, editors and photographers, drivers and machine workers, this is the labor of a huge, honest, and brave group.

    If all of "Pravda" in these years is a history of the great war, then the work of "Pravda" in the war years itself is also a part of this history, and a very important and inseparable part.

### 我们的“真理报”

    我们的“真理报”
    西蒙诺夫罗焚译
    本文是苏联作家康士坦丁·西蒙诺夫为“真理报”出版一万期纪念而作，发表于一九四五年九月二十五日的“红星报”。文中对怎样作一个党报的优秀的记者和通讯员，和“真理报”在伟大的爱国自卫战争中怎样英勇无畏地工作，均有所记述。我们刊载此文的目的，一方面为了教育党报工作者和通讯员同志们，另外也供广大读者同志学习怎样严肃的对待革命事业，怎样以一个正确的标准来对待党报和监督党报的工作。
          ——编者
    常常是这样，我们不大思考很常用的字的真实的意义，我们每天照例要翻开报纸，在报头上有两个字——“真理”，我们不大在这个名字上用脑筋。但除此而外，很难找一个更简单的、更有力的、更正确的字来作这个报纸的名字的了。就同任何报纸的同人一样，“真理报”的同人，也是由各种各样的人们组成的：作家、新闻记者、通讯员、访员、艺术家、摄影师，但是印在这报头上的两个字——“真理”（真实）团结了所有这些、经常是各式各样的人们，树立了共同的方向，共同的原则，共同的工作作风。
    在我们的生活中，在最大的和最小的事情上，真实都是重要的。我们是地球上的最坚定的真理追求者，我们把整个生命都献给那为了真理与正义在地球上获胜的斗争。
    因此，自然而然的，勿庸异议的，我们联共（布）党中央委员会的机关报，就只能是而且也应该叫做这唯一的两个字——“真理”。
    但是，大的真理（真实），是由许多小的真理（真实）堆积起来的。因此，在一切的情况下，寻找真实——首先是真实而且只能是真实——成了每一个在“真理报”工作的人的无条件的前提。即使这是登在报纸最后一版上的一小条新闻纪事，或者，这是在莫斯科外围战的严峻的日子里，一篇很认真的估计局势的社论——一样的，归根结蒂总得合于一个相同的原则性的标准；这应当是真实的，从头到脚都是真实的。
    在保卫祖国战争这样艰难困苦的条件下，在前线的条件下，追求真实，想要精确的和客观的阐明一切细微末节，是困难的而且常是危险的事情。为了真实地描写战争，便需要亲身看见战争，而为了要亲身看见战争，便需要经受战争的最直接的参加者——前线上的兵士和军官——所经受的同样的危险。
    对于“真理报”的战地通讯员，无论有着什么样的困难，要想直接弄清楚一件事的真实情况，是他们永远不变的特质。
    “真理报”给了自己的通讯员们一些高尚的和困难的任务，这些通讯员当中，有不少人已经在战场上英勇地牺牲了。关于每一个死者，都可以写上很多很多的，但我现在首先想到了两个人——两个很不相同的人，甚至他们的职业都是各异的。但是他们在前线上所共同代表的一个报纸，以及他们共同的行动作风，永远联系了他们。这就是世界闻名的作家叶夫格尼·波特罗夫和我们最著名的摄影记者之一——米哈依尔·卡拉式尼可夫。
    在战时，我不止一次地同他们两人碰过头，这两个人是不完全一样的，但“真理报”记者所特具的共同的特征结合了他们。首先，这是很认真的两个人，永是认真地思考一切，为自己的每一句话，每一件工作认真负责的。如果用办报人的话来说，这是干练的、具备着楔而不舍的精神的坚强的人物。
    我记起在卡累利亚前线上，我亲眼看见叶夫格尼·波特罗夫同战士和军官好几次的谈话，他从来不寻找皮相的感觉，不追逐不切实的谈话的平易的印象。他，“真理报”记者，首先想知道的是真实，吹牛皮的，或者真正勇敢的，但却喜欢夸张自己的功绩的人，都不能够欺骗他。
    波特罗夫善于在人里面发见最重要的、真正的和生活的真理。有时候，在他忍耐着听完了一顿夸夸其谈的谈话之后，他说：
    ——不，我不写这个人。
    相反的，他却有耐心在一个沉默的，不大会讲话的人那里化好几个钟头，仔细地听完各种各样的，仿佛是最琐碎的一些细节，而感觉这个人是真正的英雄。他无论如何要发现真理，而且用最细密的精确性去阐明和表现它。
    除去这个出色的人和作家的积极性而外，在他的工作里，便强烈地感觉出他曾经经过了一个长时期的业务训练，感觉得出他在“真理报”工作了很多年，这个工作使他学会了正确地处理问题；有了责任感和义务感。而这些，是他认真地工作得来的。
    当我论述着“真理报”的同一时候，我想起了米哈依尔·卡拉式尼可夫，他是一个摄影记者，这个人总是以首先一个共产主义者，以一个负责着一个巨大的报纸的人的态度对待自己的事业。整个国家都知道卡拉式尼可夫拍的照片。这些照片即许是极细小的地方都是不做作的，都是在真正的战斗环境下拍制的。
    摄影记者的职业，是一个复杂的职业。它要求灵活，要求善于适应环境，要求给人们拍照的时候，善于估量这个地点和时间是否合于报纸的需要。
    卡拉式尼可夫善于正确的和毫不讲价钱的完成报纸的每一个任务。他会在最复杂的情况里，保持自己高度的自尊心，因为他想到自己是一个报纸的代表，而这个报纸，无论他和谁谈到它，都不能不尊重它的。
    “真理报”的战地访员，在战争初期的严重的日子里，在危急的时刻，都是留在报纸所指示给他们的岗位上。而报纸本身，在一九四一年十月和十一月的严峻的时日里，当远处的炮声达到莫斯科的时候，她还是泰然自若地守在自己岗位上，还是在先前那道街上，还是在我们大家都熟悉的那幢房子里。前线靠近莫斯科了，在这些日子里，“真理报”距离最前线，比别的时候的任何战地报纸都来得接近。炸弹就在街对面爆炸；烧夷弹落在印刷局的屋顶上；爆炸震动得每一个编辑室里的玻璃往外飞。但是，“真理报”出版着。
    我把这些秋天的和冬天的日子记得很清楚，在这幢房子里，除去“真理报”而外，还有着其它几个中央报纸。去前线的访员们，只要五十分钟，一点钟，一点半钟，就可以到达最前线；有时候，在一昼夜内，他们跑去前线两次。轰炸没有停息过，但是，每一个办公室仍旧燃着这般安静的灯光，在规定的时间仍然一点不差的出着整版整版的报纸；仍然是这样精细，报纸的每一页都要经过校对员和编辑的好几次校对，因为，真实不仅在巨大的事件上，在细小的事情上也是重要的。
    这幢出版报纸的房子，对德国人充满了轻视。这证明了：战线的迫近和希特勒孤注一掷的进攻，都丝毫不能改变编辑部的任何习惯以及任何共同的工作作风，报纸充分地发表了关于战情严重的真实的字句，关于德国人的进攻，关于德国人向莫斯科的逼近，但是报纸本身却这样泰然自若地出版着，好象它离开它住的房屋有一千公里似的。
    一定的，经过二十年或三十年以后，我们会以这样的兴奋和尊敬翻阅一九四一、四二、四三年这一时期的已经发黄的全部“真理报”，就如同我们现在翻阅一九一七、一八、一九年的全部“真理报”一样。报纸上的许多事情都过去了，许多事情今天活着而明天就会死去的。但是，当报纸是公正的，当它清楚地正确和勇敢地反映了自己的时代的时候，它自己就是一个历史。
    在战争日子里，“真理报”的每一页都呼唤人们奔向战斗，告诉人们——“坚持！”“不停息地前进！”日复一日地讲说士兵的心上所需要听的全部东西。“真理报”的每一页都将成为伟大斗争的底年代记——这是没有疑问的。
    “真理报”出版一万期了。在这一万期中间，有一千多期是在祖国战争的年代中出版的。所有我们历经了这个战争的人们今天都想说：这不是简单的一千多期报纸，这是各种最不相同的人们——作家和排字工人、访员和校对员、编辑和摄影师、汽车夫和机器工人积极劳动的成果，这是巨大的、正直的、勇敢的集团的劳动成果。
    如果说，这几年中的全部的“真理报”，是伟大战争的一部历史，那么，战争年代中的“真理报”的工作本身，也就是这部历史的一部分，而且是很重要的和不可分割的一部分。
