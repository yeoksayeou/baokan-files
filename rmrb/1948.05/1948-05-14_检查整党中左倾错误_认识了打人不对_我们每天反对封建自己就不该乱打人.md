    [Ping Shun News] After the Dongchan work group in the Fifth District initially reviewed and corrected the leftist errors in land reform, they proceeded to examine the deviations in this party rectification. Li Heze said, "My understanding of hitting people has not been thoroughly resolved. I only realize that we shouldn't hit peasants in the future, but I still thought hitting landlords and rich peasants was okay. At the Luciazhuang meeting discussing work in Dongchan Village, I believed that bad cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds had to be beaten by the masses. So, when I came to Dongchan Village and heard about the many bad deeds of Cheng Caosuo, whom the masses called the 'Living Yama of Three Imprints' and who had embezzled millions of fruits, the masses were all afraid of him. In order to mobilize the masses, I let the masses beat him up and detained him at the district office. The leadership pointed out that hitting people was wrong and wouldn't solve the problem, but I always thought that problems couldn't be solved without hitting people. When the masses rose up to beat him, I even kicked him. I didn't act according to policy, which scared the comrades who hadn't passed the test and had a bad effect on the whole district and county." Comrades like Cao Laishui said, "Although we didn't personally hit people, we didn't oppose hitting people in our thinking, and we echoed others. In the beginning, for every party member, we scrutinized them harshly, not even giving them a kind look." After everyone's initial reflection, they clearly recognized that they had committed a principle error, which not only scared Cheng Caosuo into not admitting his mistakes and even risking his life to resist, but also frightened some people related to Caosuo, who dared not speak. Especially when the cadres of the four surrounding villages were afraid of being beaten and were lying down and refusing to get up, this made them even more panicked, creating opportunities for a few revenge-seekers to strike at the cadres. After the review, everyone resolved to correct their mistakes, act honestly according to the Party's policies, and make a reflection among the masses, so that the whole district could correct itself in a timely manner. Then, a meeting of party members and representatives of poor peasant associations and middle and poor peasant party rectification was convened to examine and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the first party rectification. Everyone believed that the purpose of party rectification was to improve the party and let it lead the masses well, not to overthrow it and prevent it from rising again.
    Regarding the issue of hitting people, Wang Quan said, "Party rectification speaks of truth. We resolved the problems of 35 party members in our village, and even the attitude was not necessary. Most of the problems have been clarified. We beat Cao Suo a few days ago, and the result was all for nothing." Wang Zhusheng retorted, "The Eighth Route Army doesn't hit good people. As for Cheng Caosuo, hitting him once isn't enough." At this time, a debate unfolded at the meeting. The working member put forward his opinion, not agreeing with hitting people, and gave the reasons. Woman Cheng Erhua said, "We oppose feudalism every day, and we also oppose bad cadres beating and scolding the masses, which is undemocratic. Our poor peasant association is a model of democracy, not letting anyone be wronged. If we arbitrarily hit people again, wouldn't we be the same as the old cadres?" Old man Niu Caoxi said, "I used to smoke opium and gamble, and I was also punished by the old government many times; but the number of people smoking increased day by day. After the Eighth Route Army came, they didn't beat or scold, but talked about politics. Who in our village still smokes now?" Wang Chenghai said, "Cheng Caosuo was beaten, and what was the result? Cadres in other villages say that we in Dongchan Village hit people, scaring them into lying down and not working. How do you say this account should be settled?" Wang Gaizhi's opinion was also the same: bad cadres should be educated. If their crimes are too great, they should be sent to the People's Court for handling according to the law. The vast majority of the masses supported doing this. Only two people did not understand, and the responsible comrade of the work group sincerely asked them to learn from those who did not hit people, and proposed to ensure that party members will implement the party's policies in the future, and let the masses criticize them at any time if they have mistakes, which improved everyone's confidence.

    检查整党中左倾错误
    认识了打人不对
    我们每天反对封建自己就不该乱打人
    【平顺消息】五区东禅工作组初步检讨纠正土改中左倾错误后，接着又检查这次整党中的偏向。李合则说：“我对打人思想就没得到彻底解决。只认识今后不要打农民，打地主富农还没啥。在鹿家庄会议上研究东禅村工作时，我就认为地主富农出身的坏干部必须叫群众打。所以一来东禅村听到程曹锁不少坏事，群众叫他一手三颗印的活阎王，贪污果实百万元，群众对他无不害怕。为了发动群众，就让群众打了他一顿，将他扣到区公所。领导上提出打人不对，解决不了问题，但我总想不打人也解决不了问题。群众起来打他时，我还踢了他一脚。我这是没按政策办事，影响没过关那几个同志也害怕起来，对全区全县也起了坏作用。”曹来水等同志说：“我们虽没有亲自动手打人，但思想上没有反对打人，是随声附和。一开始那几天，对每个党员都是核桃枣一类数，连一片好脸都没给过他们。”经过大家初步反省，明确认识是犯了原则错误，不仅吓得程曹锁一点也不敢认错，还用命来顶，一部分和曹锁有关系的也害了怕，不敢说了。特别是四外邻村干部正在怕吃打，躺倒不起时，这样使他们更加恐慌，给少数报复分子钻空子打击干部造成机。会经过检讨，大家决心纠正，忠忠实实按照党的政策办事，并在群众中作反省，要使全区及时纠正过来。接着就召集党员与贫农团及中、贫农整党代表会议，检查总结第一次整党的优缺点。大家都认为整党目的是把党整好，叫他好好领导群众，不是打倒，叫他起不来。
    关于打人问题，王圈则说：“整党讲真理，咱村卅五个党员解决问题，就连态度都没要，问题也大部都搞清了。咱们前几天打曹锁，结果落了个一场空。”王住胜反驳说：“八路军是不打好人，象程曹锁，光打还不行。”这时会场展开了辩论。工作员提出意见，不赞成打人，将理由提出来。妇女程二花说：“咱们每天反对封建，又反对坏干部打骂群众，不民主，咱们贫农团是民主模范，不让屈了一个人，咱要再随便打人，还不和旧干部一样吗？”牛曹喜老汉说：“我过去吸金丹赌博、也受过旧政府好多处罚；但吸的人一天比一天多，八路军来了，不打不骂讲政治，咱村现在谁还吸？”王成孩说：“程曹锁吃打，结果闹了个啥？外村干部都说咱东禅村打人，吓的躺倒不工作，你们说这帐叫怎算？”王改芝意见也是这样，坏干部要教育，如果罪太大，送人民法庭按法令处理。全场绝大多数群众拥护这样做。只有二人思想不通，工作组负责同志诚心诚意的叫他们向不打人的去学习。并提出今后保证党员执行党的政策，有错误让群众随时批评，提高了大家信心。
