    How many years does it take for newly liberated poor peasants in the New Area to change their class status after the May Fourth Directive?
    Comrade Editor:
    The poor peasants in the New Area who were liberated after the May Fourth Directive and received land, based on the quantity and quality of the land they received and their living standards, are now equivalent to middle peasants. Regarding the determination of the class status of such households, the Prefectural Committee once instructed that their class status should be changed after three years. However, the "New Masses" Q&A column and reports in the People's Daily on class designation in various places indicate that the class status of such liberated poor peasants is changed after one year. All such peasants in the villages believe that they have not been liberated for long and their foundation is still poor, so they disagree with being classified as new middle peasants. Poor peasants who were not liberated or not thoroughly liberated after the May Fourth Directive also believe that it is unfair to classify them as poor peasants. What class status should they be classified as? Please answer. (Xingtai County Office)

Xingtai Office:
    The instruction from the Prefectural Committee was based on past regulations. At that time, the central government's regulations on class designation had not yet been issued, and the past regulations were only for local reference and research. Now that the central government has new regulations, we must act in accordance with the new regulations. However, when designating class status, it is important to ensure that they have genuinely lived a middle peasant life for a year. Those who have only obtained land and still lack other property, and those who have obtained land for a year but have not yet obtained enough seeds... In short, those who have not genuinely lived a middle peasant life for a year are still poor peasants or farm laborers. Those who have genuinely lived a middle peasant life for a year should be classified as middle peasants (new middle peasants are also middle peasants, not a separate class. It refers to those poor peasants and farm laborers who have been liberated and become middle peasants under the influence of the policies and decrees of the democratic government). If the masses are dissatisfied or disagree, persuasion and education should be strengthened, and the principle cannot be changed based on their satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

### 新区在五四指示后翻身的贫农几年变成份？

    新区在五四指示后翻身的贫农几年变成份？
    编者同志：
    新区五四指示后分得土地翻身的贫农，从分得土地数量和质量及生活上看，已相当于中农，关于这样户的成份确定问题，地委曾指示三年后改变成份，但新大众在问答栏对这一问题的解释，及人民日报透露各地划阶级中对此类翻身贫农之成份确定，皆是一年后改变成份。乡村中凡是这样农民，均以为自己翻身不久底子还穷，划为新中农不同意。五四指示后未翻身和翻身不透的贫农，又以为他们划为贫农不公道，究该划为何种成份呢？请解答一下。    （邢台县办公室）邢台办公室：
    所说地委的指示，是按过去的规定，那时中央划阶级的规定尚未发下，过去的规定只供各地参考研究。现在中央既已有新的规定，就要按新的规定办事。不过在划阶级时要注意是确实过了一年中农生活。只得了土地，其他财产还很不够的，以及得了土地够一年，得籽还不够一年的；………总之，没有确实过够一年中农生活的，就还是贫农或雇农。而已经确实过了一年中农生活的，也就不必说底子穷不穷了，一定要划为中农（新中农也就是中农，不是一个单独的阶层，是指贫农雇农受民主政府的政策法令的影响而翻身成为中农的人们），群众有不满意或不同意的地方，应加说服教育，不能以他们的满意与否而变更规定原则。
