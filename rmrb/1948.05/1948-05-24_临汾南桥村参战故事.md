Nanchiao Village is getting tense! Men and women, young and old, have been carefully assigned tasks and are carrying out the work of making springboards, repairing roads, delivering firewood, and grinding flour in an orderly manner. Zhao Fadun, who has been a hired laborer for fifteen years, is completely transformed from what he used to be. He has been working tirelessly for four consecutive nights without sleep, and his eyes are bloodshot, but when he heard in the middle of the night that door panels were needed, he immediately notified each household to prepare them. By dawn, three hundred door panels had been delivered to the edge of the city. On the third day, he braved the muddy spring rain and led the women's team to deliver another eight hundred catties of firewood to the supply station. On the way, he happily said, "What is this? The troops in the trenches are suffering much more than us." These past few days, he hasn't been able to take care of his family's life. When his wife asked him for food, he said, "These days, my heart is completely focused on this (supporting the front lines). As long as Linfen is captured and the Communist Party implements the equal distribution of land, then we'll have everything. Why worry about not having food?" Guo, an elderly military dependent in her fifties, heard that the women had ground twenty piculs of wheat flour overnight, and saw with her own eyes that Jing Xiangmei was discussing with her chanting-Buddhist-scriptures father-in-law about removing the eight door panels from their home and sending them to the village headquarters. The entire village was in an uproar. Groups of women happily carried door panels, marching past her like a demonstration. She envied their ability to do things and muttered to herself, "We really don't have anything!" Suddenly, she limped to the village office and grabbed the village chief, saying, "Quickly, tear down my broken house and let the troops use it." But no one agreed with her idea, and she walked away very disappointed, feeling even more anxious in her heart. But she only thought, even though my leg is bad, I can still go to the edge of the village and boil some water for our people to drink. The next day, she set up a pot in the middle of the village, boiling water. She happily delivered bowls of boiling water to the hands of the passing troops. The soldiers asked her why she was so good to the army. Old lady Guo said, "I can live because you came. In the past, I couldn't pay the grain, and people tied me to a tree, placed square bricks on my head, and whipped me with leather whips. You have come, and I will no longer be oppressed." Young He Maodan had made a living as a carpenter since he was a child. Under the rule of the Yan bandit army, Maodan had to repair blockhouses and build fortifications for the Yan bandits every few days. Once, he worked a little slower and was pushed down from a blockhouse more than two zhang high by the enemy, falling into a pond like a drowned rat and becoming sick. When the People's Liberation Army came, Maodan heard that the Communist Party was supporting small handicraft industries. These past few days, whenever he thought of his beautiful future, he would often smile contentedly. When the village was bustling with participation in the war, he always worked day and night. He still worked even when it was dark, with a lamp lit. He worked in the rain, with sweat and rainwater mingling and soaking his clothes, but he continued to work. In one night, he pulled three hundred and fifty ten-two-foot-long wooden strips.

　　临汾南桥村参战故事
    克昌
    南桥村紧张起来了！男女老少已严密分工，有条不紊的进行着做跳板、修路、送柴火、磨面等工作。当了十五年雇工的赵发盾和以前简直变了个样，他不知疲劳的工作已经一连四夜没有睡觉，一双眼圈熬得红红的，可是他半夜听说要送门板，马上通知各家准备，到天明时三百块门板已送到城边。第三天他又冒着春雨的泥泞，领着妇女队又把八百斤劈柴送到兵站。一路上他高兴的说：“这算什么，队伍在战壕里比咱苦的多哩。”这两天他也顾不上照顾家里的生活，他老婆找他要吃的，他说：“这几天我的心全用在这上头（支援前线），只要打下临汾，共产党实行平分土地，那时啥也有啦，还愁没吃的？”五十多岁的军属郭老太太，听说妇女连夜磨出廿石麦子的面，又亲眼看到景香梅正在与念经的公公商量，把家里的八块门板卸下送到村指挥部。整个村全部轰动了，成群结队的妇女，愉快的扛着门板，象示威一样从他面前穿过，她羡慕着人家能干，喃喃的自语说：“咱真是要啥没啥！”忽然她一跛一跛跑到村公所拉着村长说：“快去把我的破房子拆了叫队伍用吧。”可是谁也不同意她的意见，她很扫兴的走出来，心里越发着急，但她心里只想我的腿虽不好，到村边给咱的人烧点水喝总能办到。第二天她在村中间架起一口锅，烧着沸腾腾的开水，她又笑喜喜的一碗一碗的送到过路队伍的手里，战士们问她为什么对军队这样好？郭老太太说：“你们来了我就能活，过去我交不起粮，人家把我绑在树上，头顶方砖用皮鞭子打，你们来了我就再不受人欺压了。”年青的贺毛旦从小就凭木匠过活，在阎匪军统治下，毛旦三天两头给阎匪修炮楼做工事，一次做的慢了些，被敌人从两丈多高的炮楼上推下来跌在泊池里象个落汤鸡，回去病了一场。解放军来了，毛旦听到共产党扶植小手工业者，这两天一想到美满的前途，常常得意的微笑，村里闹着参战，他总是夜以继日的工作着，天黑了还点着灯干。他冒雨做活汗珠与雨水交流滴湿他的衣衫，他还是照样的干，一夜拉成三百五十根丈二长的木条。
