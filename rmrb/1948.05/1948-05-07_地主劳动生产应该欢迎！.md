To the Editor:

I have two questions about class determination that I am unclear on, and I hope you can provide answers:

　　1. In my village, there was a household that had been a middle peasant for many years. In 1943, during the famine, they bought over ten mu of land. In 1944, they hired a long-term laborer. In the spring of 1945, when mobilizing the masses, they were struggled against. The land bought during the famine was redeemed by the original owners, and their original land was untouched. They haven’t hired laborers since, and they still possess their original land. What class should they be considered?

　　2. In issue 669 of your newspaper, Comrade Ren Bishi’s report stated that landlords could change their class status after five years of labor, and rich peasants after three years of stopping exploitation. However, they still retain a large amount of land and property, and should hand over their surplus land and property. But some landlords and rich peasants began participating in labor and stopped exploitation at the time of the incident (1937); and they still retain more property, such as one household having three or four tile-roofed houses. If we don't touch their houses, in the future they might sell the tile-roofed houses and exchange them for shabby houses, but they would still have more property and develop faster than ordinary peasants. What should be done in this case?

Comrade Li Jingbo:

The answers to your two questions are as follows:

　　1. In your village, a middle peasant household increased their land by over ten mu in 1943 and hired a long-term laborer in 1944. They were struggled against in the spring of 1945. You didn't state the reasons for the struggle at that time. Judging from the questions you raised, it was probably because they were being treated as rich peasants. According to the Central Committee's recent decision, "Those whose exploitation portion exceeds 25% and continues for three years are considered rich peasants." It is not clear whether the exploitation income of the middle peasant household at that time exceeded 25% of their total income, but their economic rise and exploitation of hired laborers did not last for three years, so they cannot be classified as rich peasants. Therefore, according to the document's decision, they were wrongly struggled against at that time. After the struggle, they only retained their original land and no longer hired laborers. Their class status should, of course, still be that of a middle peasant. Generally speaking, rich peasants who stopped exploitation after the struggle in the spring of 1945 should have already transformed into other classes by now.

　　2. "Landlords and rich peasants in the old liberated areas, under the democratic government, have declined due to reasonable burdens, rent and interest reduction, and liquidation struggles. Landlords who engage in agricultural labor themselves and no longer exploit others for five consecutive years should have their class status changed and be assessed as peasants. Rich peasants who have abolished their exploitation for three consecutive years should also be changed to peasant class status. However, those landlords and rich peasants who still retain a lot of feudal property should still hand over their surplus property to be distributed to poor peasants." According to Comrade Ren Bishi's remarks, the landlords and rich peasants you asked about who participated in labor and stopped exploitation in 1937 have already transformed their class status. They still retain more feudal property, and the surplus can be taken out and distributed to poor people who lack this property. This approach is for the sake of the masses' emancipation and not out of fear that they will develop quickly. Since they have already changed their class status and handed over their surplus feudal property, if they can become rich through diligent labor and production, that should be welcomed and encouraged.

### 地主劳动生产应该欢迎！

　　地主劳动生产应该欢迎！编辑同志：
    我对确定阶级有两个问题闹不明确，希解答一下：
    一、我村有一户以前好多年是中农，于三十二年灾荒时，买了十几亩地，三十三年雇了长工，三十四年春发动群众时，把他斗争了，灾荒时买的地，买的谁的谁赎回去了，他的原地也未动，以后也不雇工了，还是保有他以前的土地。象这样应该是啥成份？
    二、贵报“六六九期”刊载任弼时同志的报告，地主劳动五年，富农停止剥削三年可变其成份。但他们仍保有多量土地与财产，则可交出其多余土地及财产。但有的地主、富农在事变时（一九三七年）即已参加劳动与停止剥削；而他们还保有较多的财产，如一户即有三、四座瓦房，如不动他的房屋，将来他们把瓦房变卖换成赖房，还是比一般的农民财产要多，发展要快，这样的话，应该怎么办呢？　　　　　　　　
　　冠县县政府　李镜波李镜波同志：
    你的两个问题答复如下：
    一、你村的一户中农卅二年增加了十几亩地，三十三年雇了长工，卅四年春就被斗争了。你没有说明当时斗争他是什么原因，从你所提的问题来估计，大概当时是把他当成富农来斗的。照中央最近的决定“剥削部分超过百分之二十五而且连续三年者才算富农”，那么该中农户当时的剥削收入部分是否超过其总收入的百分之二十五没有说清，但他经济上升及对雇工的剥削不到三年，不能划为富农，因此，按照文件决定看来，当时对他是错斗了，斗了以后，他只保有原地，也不再雇工，他的成份当然应该仍是中农成份。就一般富农来说，三十四年春天斗争以后，如已停止剥削，到现在也该转变为其他成份了。
    二、“老解放区的地主富农，在民主政权下，因合理负担、减租减息、清算斗争而下降，凡地主自己从事农业劳动，不再剥削人，连续有五年者，应改变其成份，评定为农民。富农已连续三年取消其剥削者，亦应改为农民成份。但这些地主富农仍保有许多封建财产者，则仍应交出其多余的财产分给贫苦农民。”按照任弼时同志的这段谈话，你所问的在三七年即已参加劳动停止剥削的地主富农，其成份已经转变，他们仍保有较多的封建财产，多余部分可以拿出来分给缺乏这些财产的贫苦群众。这样做法是为了群众翻身而不是为了恐怕他们发展得快。他们既已改变成份，多余的封建财产亦已交出，假如自己能够勤劳生产发家致富，那是应该欢迎和鼓励的。
