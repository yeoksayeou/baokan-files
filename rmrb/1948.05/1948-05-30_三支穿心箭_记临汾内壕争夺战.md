　　Three Piercing Arrows
    ——A Record of the Battle for the Inner Moat in Linfen

　　At 7:40 PM on the 17th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive on the city of Linfen. As soon as the order for the general offensive was given, two large gaps were torn open in the high and thick walls of Linfen. The three assault teams of Dengzhou's "206," like three piercing arrows, broke through the gaps and flew straight towards the enemy in the inner moat. Zhang Liquan's light machine gun, like a fire dragon, nimbly searched for gun emplacements to the left and right. Zhang Wuan ran through the minefield, blew up the enemy's machine gun fortifications that were firing at the breakthrough point, and removed the small obstacles on the path forward.

　　The enemy along the inner moat concentrated all their forces to try to block these three fierce arrowheads. Shells, poison gas, and TNT explosives turned the breakthrough point into a sea of fire. Warriors Yang Wei Yao and Zhao Tai Quan skillfully approached the edge of the inner moat. Hand grenades from Meng Sanhuan, Niu Quanbao... and others flew in rows into the inner edge of the moat. The enemy's artillery fire intensified, and the warriors became even more tenacious, like steel nails, firmly planted in a wheat field right next to the enemy's inner moat.

　　Hao Wulin and Chen Xin Yuan's divine artillery silenced the two machine guns on the roof that the enemy were madly firing. The second grenade eliminated the enemy being monitored in the inner moat. Li Shimin and others' five heavy machine guns roared fiercely, firmly blocking the enemy's gun emplacements. Ma Jinlong returned from scouting the assault route, and Battalion Commander Wang issued the "Rush forward!" assault order from the crowd. Wounded Ma Jinlong turned over and was the first to jump into the inner moat. The enemy was thrown into disarray, and the warriors surged forward and occupied the inner moat.

　　Gao Ruming's machine gun suppressed an enemy machine gun. The vanguard on the left wing also rushed into the inner moat. Enemy fire from 40 meters away concentrated on them again, and a platoon of enemy soldiers followed with a counterattack from the left wing, but they were repelled. Special Class Merit Citation recipient Che Yuanlu climbed onto the inner edge of the inner moat. Yan Jinzhong threatened the enemy inside the house and disarmed them, and the house was occupied.

　　Tian Zhongqi's platoon, on the right arrowhead, tenaciously pounced on the enemy. Squad Leader Zhang Dongwu and Wang Xigui were wounded and fell, but they got up and charged at the enemy again. Some even charged at the enemy with four wounds. Mutual Aid Team Leader Sun Wanshan charged over from the left wing and was the first to run into the enemy's inner moat. The nine who followed were all wounded, but Fourth Squad Leader Li Xinrong and others still resolutely charged forward. Special Class Merit Citation recipient Che Yuanlu charged in, seized two enemy light machine guns, and one Type 38 rifle. Coordinating with the firepower of various artillery units, after a 40-minute battle, they finally occupied the inner moat. Thus, the last lifeline of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's bandits, consisting of 300 meters of open ground, a foot pit minefield with barbed wire, and the 300-meter inner moat guarded by a battalion of troops, was pierced by three strong piercing arrows in 40 minutes.

　　三支穿心箭
    ——记临汾内壕争夺战
    十七号下午七时四十分，人民解放军一部对临汾城发起总攻。总攻令一下，又高又厚的临汾城就被掀开了两个很大的缺口。邓州部“二○六”的三个突击队，象三支穿心箭一样突过缺口，直向内壕敌人飞去。张立全的歪把机枪，象条火龙，灵活寻找左右的枪眼，张五岸跑过地雷区，炸翻了正向突破口射击的敌人机枪工事，拔掉了前进路上的小钉钉。
    内壕沿的敌人集中了所有兵力，想来阻击这三支勇猛的箭头子，射来的炮弹、毒气、黄炸药在突破口上燃成一片火海。勇士杨维姚、赵太全机巧的接近在内壕近沿，孟三还、牛全保………等的手榴弹也跟着一排排的飞进了内壕内沿。敌人炮火越加激烈，勇士们也越加顽强象钢钉一样，坚固的钉在紧接敌人内壕边的一块麦地。
    郝五林、陈新垣的神炮，两炮揍哑了房上敌人狂叫的两挺机枪，第二颗手榴弹又干掉了内壕被监视的敌人，李士明等的五挺重机枪，强烈的发出吼叫，死死的封锁住敌人的枪眼。马金龙侦察突击路回来，王营长就在人群中发出了“赶快冲的突击命令，负伤的马金龙又翻身第一个跳进内壕，敌人被打乱了，勇士们一涌占领了内壕。
    高如明的机枪压住了敌人的一挺机枪，左翼前头的也冲进了内壕，距四十米达的敌人火力又集中到他们这里，一个排的敌人也跟着从左翼反扑过来，但都被打退了。特等功臣车元禄，随着登上内壕内沿，阎金忠威胁着在房内的敌人缴了枪，这个房子被占领了。
    右箭头的田中其排，顽强的扑向敌人，班长张东午，王西贵负伤躺倒又爬起来，有的连负四处伤还向敌人冲去。互助组长孙万山从左翼冲过，第一个跑进敌人内壕，接着下去的九个都负了伤，四班长李新荣等仍坚决的冲上。特等功臣车元禄攻进去夺过敌人两挺拐把机枪，一支三八式步枪。配合着各种炮兵的火力，经四十分钟的争夺战，终于占领了内壕。至此蒋阎匪从三百米的开阔地和筑有铁丝网的脚坑地雷区，和以一营兵力把守的三百米内壕最后生命线，在四十分钟内被三支强固的穿心箭射穿了。　　（汤踌）
