Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: TASS, Pyongyang, 15th: Following the publication of the Soviet government's reply to the joint conference of North and South Korean democratic parties and organizations, expressing its willingness to withdraw troops, working people in all factories, institutions, and rural areas of North Korea have held meetings to warmly welcome the decision. Industrialist Tai Su-hee stated at a mass meeting in Pyongyang: "The Soviet government's statement on its readiness to withdraw troops from Korea is in line with the desire of our entire nation to strive for independence." Miner An Zhang-ang of the Satun Mine said: "The Soviet government's expression of its hope that the Korean people will establish a free and independent country without foreign interference strengthens our confidence in the democratic forces." Pyongyang railway workers, in their letter to Premier Stalin, expressed their gratitude to the Soviet Union for assisting the Korean people's movement for independence and liberation and economic construction. When representatives of democratic parties and organizations from North and South Korea read the Soviet reply at a meeting commemorating the victory over fascist Germany, there was thunderous applause. They immediately passed a resolution to send a telegram to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, which stated: "The Korean people see that the Soviet Union's foreign policy is always consistent. The Soviet Union's readiness to withdraw troops from Korea and allow us the right to handle our own affairs is fully in line with and encourages the wishes of the Korean people." At the same time, they expressed their deep gratitude for the Soviet Union's "completely selfless support" for the Korean people's struggle for freedom, democracy, and independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Moscow dispatch: A commentator in *Pravda* commented on the South Korean sham election on the 15th, stating: "The so-called 'election' in South Korea has been going on for five days, but the election results have not yet been announced. This farce staged by the American occupation authorities under the banner of the United Nations Korean Commission, no matter what the officially announced results may be, cannot deceive anyone. The wave of anger against the sham election, against the American occupation's divisionists, and against the tyranny of the American garrison authorities, which began in South Korea on the 8th, has spread throughout the country." The commentator continued: "The Soviet Union firmly believes that only the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea can guarantee the free expression of the will of the entire Korean people. On May 7 this year, the Soviet Union reiterated its intention to withdraw troops from Korea, but only on the condition that American troops withdraw at the same time. However, all indications show that the United States does not intend to withdraw its troops from Korea." The commentator finally revealed: "The American garrison authorities are trying to occupy Korea for a long time and force South Korea onto the path of so-called 'Western democracy' by force."

　　苏打算自朝鲜撤军
  　北鲜人民深表感激
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】据塔斯社平壤十五日讯：苏政府致南北鲜民主党派团体联席会议声明愿意撤军的复文发表后，北鲜所有工厂、机关和农村中的劳动人民纷纷集会热烈欢迎。工业家台苏希在平壤群众大会上谈称：苏政府准备自朝鲜撤军的声明，符合于我们全民族争取独立的愿望。萨顿矿工安章昂说：苏联政府表示期望朝鲜人民不受外国干涉而建立自由独立的国家，这增强了我们对民主力量的信心。平壤铁路工人在其致斯大林总理的信上，感谢苏联协助朝鲜人民的独立解放运动和经济建设。南北鲜民主党派团体代表在庆祝战胜法西斯德国纪念会上宣读苏联复文时，掌声雷动，当即通过决议致电苏外长莫洛托夫，该电文略称：“朝鲜人民看到苏联的外交政策始终一致，苏联准备自朝鲜撤军，并允许给我们处理自己事务的权利，这一政策完全符合并鼓励朝鲜人民的愿望”，同时，对苏联“毫不自私的支持”朝鲜人民争取自由民主独立的斗争，深表感激。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】莫斯科讯：真理报观察家十五日评论南鲜伪选称：南鲜所谓“选举”已进行了五天，但选举结果迄今仍未揭晓。美国占领当局在联合国朝鲜委员会招牌下所串演的此一丑剧，不管其官方宣布的结果如何，都欺骗不了任何人。八日在南鲜开始的抗议伪选总罢工、反对美占区分裂主义者以及反对美驻军当局暴政的怒潮，已扩及全国。观察家继称：苏联坚决相信：只有外国军队撤离朝鲜，才能保证全鲜人民自由表达其意志。今年五月七日，苏联再度声明拟自朝鲜撤军，唯以美军同时撤退为条件。但一切迹象显示：美国不拟自朝鲜撤退其军队。观察家最后揭露：美驻军当局力图长期占领朝鲜，以武力驱使南鲜走上所谓“西方民主”的道路。
