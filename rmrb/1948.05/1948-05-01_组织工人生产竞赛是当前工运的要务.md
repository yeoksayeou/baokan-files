Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region), 28th: Chen Baoyu, Director of the Hebei-Central General Labor Union, made a detailed self-criticism of the left-leaning adventurism in the Hebei-Central worker movement in recent years at the district's first industrial conference, and proposed that inspiring and organizing all workers to launch a production competition movement is the main task of the current worker movement. He pointed out that since the Japanese surrendered, the Hebei-Central worker movement has shifted from rural hired labor work to urban worker work, and left-leaning adventurism has long existed. The Hebei-Central Worker Representative Congress in October 1945 passed a one-sided and narrow labor protection law, stipulating excessively high wages and insurance methods, and emphasizing workers' immediate interests, such as a piece of clothing or a mask, but gave few specific instructions on how to develop industry and inspire workers to work hard. As a result, many capitalists were afraid to boldly hire workers and apprentices. The two meetings in March and September 1946 again unilaterally emphasized the workers' immediate economic interests. Many worker cadres believed that in order to improve production, workers' wages must be increased, and narrowly believed that only the labor union or labor union cadres could represent the workers' interests. As soon as labor union cadres entered the factory, they only talked about workers' wages and living conditions, and rarely intervened in factory production, forming a phenomenon of incoordination between the labor union and the administration. There was a closed-door policy in the organization of the worker's union, and it was proposed to replace cadres who were not from worker backgrounds. The master-apprentice relationship of skilled workers leading apprentices and the workshop foremen was considered only an exploitative relationship. Technicians and skilled workers were regarded as aristocratic classes among the workers and were not allowed to join the workers' union. Furthermore, the rural set was mistakenly brought to the production department, and the workers were divided into landlord, rich peasant, middle peasant, and poor peasant classes, confusing the陣營(zhenying - ranks), dividing and isolating their own strength. This was a very wrong and dangerous action. Director Chen analyzed that the root causes of the above-mentioned left-leaning adventurism were mainly that the labor movement leaders and general cadres did not have a correct understanding of the policy of eliminating feudalism and developing the new democratic economy. Many labor movement cadres also did not have a correct understanding of the characteristics of the worker work in towns, and even less realized that in the labor movement in the liberated areas, the workers' current interests and long-term interests are consistent. After Director Chen explained the spirit of the Xinhua News Agency's editorial commemorating the "February 7th" strike, "Adhere to the Correct Line of the Worker Movement and Oppose 'Left' Leaning Adventurism," he clearly pointed out that all worker cadres must in the future implement Chairman Mao's economic policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" and the industrial development policy determined at this conference into the worker movement. Labor unions at all levels must unite and mobilize all workers, technicians, and engineers, and improve their class consciousness, and strive to increase production, reduce costs, improve quality, and complete and exceed production tasks. However, under certain conditions, the economic and cultural life of workers should also be appropriately taken care of. In order to implement this policy, the General Labor Union has determined that the current task of the worker movement is mainly to inspire and organize all workers to launch a production competition movement. Director Chen also proposed that in the development of the competition movement, each worker in state-owned factories should formulate a production plan based on his own technical ability, each factory should formulate labor discipline, model conditions, and reward methods, and commend models at any time. Behaviors that are passive and lazy and waste raw materials should be exposed and criticized in a timely manner, and those who deliberately damage machines and harm production should be punished. According to the specific situation of the development of the movement, a work test (or work competition) should be held every three months to improve workers' skills and promote technical competition. In addition, workers' opinions should be listened to frequently to solve workers' personal difficulties. It is also advocated to respect technology and reward technicians who are enthusiastic about teaching technology and those who are enthusiastic about researching creative technologies. In private enterprises, it is only required to abide by government laws and develop production under the conditions of benefiting both labor and capital. The entire set of state-owned factories cannot be rigidly transplanted into private enterprises.

　　组织工人生产竞赛是当前工运的要务
    【新华社晋察冀二十八日电】冀中总工会主任陈宝玉于该区首次工业会议上，对近年来冀中职工运动中的左倾冒险主义，作了详尽检讨，并提出启发与组织全体工人展开生产竞赛运动，为当前工运的主要任务。他指出，自日寇投降后，冀中工运由乡村的雇工工作转变为城市的职工工作以来，长期存在着左倾冒险主义。四五年十月的冀中职工代表大会，通过了片面的狭隘的劳动保护法，过高的规定了工资和保险办法，对工人一点一滴的眼前利益，如一件衣服，一个口罩等都十分强调，至于怎样发展工业，启发工人努力生产等则很少具体指示。致使许多资方不敢大胆雇用工人和学徒。四六年三、九月两次会议上，又片面的强调了工人眼前经济利益，不少职工干部认为要搞好生产，必须提高工人工资，并狭隘的认为只有工会或工会干部，才能代表工人利益。工会干部一进工厂，只谈工人工资和生活待遇问题，工厂生产则很少过问，形成工会与行政的不协调现象。在职工会的组织上存在着关门主义，曾提出撤换非工人出身的干部；对手艺工人带领徒弟、小作坊的掌作工人的师徒关系认为只是剥削关系；把技术人员和技术工人看做工人中的贵族阶级，不让他们加入职工会。并错误的把农村一套搬到生产部门来，在工人中划出地主、富农、中、贫农等阶级，混乱了阵营，分化孤立了自己的力量，这是非常错误危险的行动。陈主任分析产生上述左倾冒险主义的根源，主要是工运领导者和一般干部思想上对消灭封建、发展新民主主义经济的政策没有正确的认识。许多工运干部对城镇的职工工作的特点，也没有正确认识，更没有认清，在解放区的工运中，工人的目前利益和远大利益是一致的。陈主任于解释了新华社纪念“二七”“坚持职工运动的正确路线，反对‘左’倾冒险主义”社论的精神后，明确指出，全体职工干部今后必须把毛主席“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的经济政策及此次会议确定的发展工业方针，贯彻到职工运动中去。各级职工会要好好团结与发动全体工人、技师、工程师，提高其阶级觉悟，为增加生产、减低成本、提高质量、完成和超过生产任务而奋斗。但在一定条件下，对职工的经济、文化生活也应适当照顾。为贯彻此一方针，总工会确定当前的工运任务主要是启发与组织全体工人展开生产竞赛运动。陈主任又提出展开竞赛运动中，公营工厂的每个工人要根据本身的技术能力，订出生产计划，各厂制定劳动纪律，模范条件，和奖励办法，随时表扬模范。对消极怠工、浪费原料的行为，要及时揭发、批评，对故意破坏机器损害生产的要给以处分。根据运动发展的具体情况，一般的要三个月举行一次考工（或比工），来提高工人技术和推动技术竞赛。此外要经常听取工人意见，解决工人切身的困难。并提倡尊重技术，奖励热心传授技术和热心研究有创造的技术人员。在私营企业中，只要求遵守政府法令，在劳资两利的条件下，发展生产即可，不能将公营工厂的一套硬搬至私营企业中。
