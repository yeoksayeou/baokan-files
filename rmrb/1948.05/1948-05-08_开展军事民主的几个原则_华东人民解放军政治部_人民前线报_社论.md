Xinhua News Agency, Su Yu-Wan Front, May 5th: The "People's Front News," published by the Political Department of the East China People's Liberation Army, recently published an editorial entitled "Several Principles for Developing Military Democracy," stating: After the land reform study movement, the entire army's class consciousness has been universally raised, the morale of the troops is high, and the atmosphere has been renewed. Now, on this foundation, we must continue to develop military democracy and integrate it with actual combat, military education, and administrative management, connecting political democracy, economic democracy, and military democracy into a whole, becoming a regular and normalized democratic life and democratic style for our army, so that the class essence can be further developed and tactics and techniques can be further improved to meet the new and great victorious situation. This is an event of paramount importance in the history of our army's construction. In order to ensure the smooth and correct development of military democracy, the following principles and opinions are put forward.

First, the key to developing military democracy lies first in commanders at all levels establishing a correct concept of military democracy and overcoming the tendency of some commanders to fear military democracy. Some of them rely on their experience and meritorious service, are arrogant and complacent, and are unwilling or afraid to face their shortcomings and mistakes squarely. Others have been promoted quickly due to the needs of the war, feel that their abilities are insufficient, and see that soldiers can come up with good ideas and good methods in military democracy, so they worry about their prestige and fear that it will be difficult to command and lead in the future. The former is seen among higher-level commanders, while the latter is common among company and platoon cadres. Although they may admit military democracy, they only regard it as a matter of methods and means, and some even fundamentally deny it, believing that democracy is not allowed in the military. The reason why they do this is primarily because they one-sidedly emphasize the centrality of the military, failing to understand that every combat order is a concentrated expression of the interests of the people and the vast number of commanders and fighters, and represents the intention of each level of organization, and is established on the most democratic foundation. This is not a manifestation of any personal privilege, nor can it be handled by any individual alone. Whether an order is correct or not affects the victory or defeat of the battle, and is related to the interests, and even the lives, of the people and the vast number of commanders and fighters. Therefore, implementing military democracy is a manifestation of every commander being responsible to the people, to comrades, and to the revolution, and it is also a serious practical test of whether they can implement correct command and fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to them by the Party and the people. Secondly, it is because they are accustomed to simplistic command methods, do not study in peacetime, do not pay attention to troop construction and education and training, do not pay attention to pre-war preparations in wartime, and do not carefully understand and analyze the enemy's situation, but often rely solely on personal bravery, "one-rush-ism," thinking that military democracy will increase trouble, and that tactics and techniques cannot be learned well in a short time, as long as they can fight. They do not understand that war is a highly developed art, with both sides concentrating all manpower and material resources, constantly seeking the other's weaknesses, and engaging in life-and-death struggles. At the same time, due to the different and rapidly changing combat targets, times, locations, and conditions, no matter how smart and capable a commander is, they cannot see everything clearly and take care of everything. However, battles often determine victory or defeat due to the grasp of instantaneous opportunities and the utilization of small conditions. To remedy this defect, we can only implement military democracy and promote the enthusiasm and creativity of all commanders and fighters. If we insist on arrogance, complacency, and monopolizing everything, we will inevitably commit subjectivist errors and cause losses to the revolution. War technology is not something mysterious and elusive. The history of our army's growth and development over the past twenty years, and the great victories it has created, proves that our vast number of commanders and fighters have special creations in the revolutionary war and are able to master this art, and the latest tactics and techniques will surely be mastered by us. Thirdly, it is also because they lack the courage for self-criticism and are afraid that the masses will rise up to expose their shortcomings and mistakes. They know that the consequences of mistakes made in commanding operations are even worse than those in general work, and they are afraid that the soldiers will retaliate or no longer obey orders. They do not understand that the implementation of military democracy is to seek the transformation and improvement of the entire army's tactics and techniques, not to simply pursue responsibility for the past shortcomings and mistakes of a certain individual or a group of people. After the commander listens to the opinions of the masses and implements correct self-criticism and improves tactical command, their leadership ability and confidence will inevitably be greatly improved. Military democracy is not entirely unfamiliar to our army. As early as the large-scale training movement in 1943, our army implemented the mass line of officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers. In the revolutionary war, we created military education methods such as "small staff meetings," "Zhuge Liang meetings," "assessment of casualties," and "assessment of technology." General Chen Yi has also repeatedly instructed: "Learn warfare through warfare" and "Take one step forward with each battle," which is a basic requirement for building the army. "Military democracy" is precisely the concentration and development of all this. Especially after the land reform study, the awareness of the vast number of soldiers has been raised. Some units' soldiers have automatically requested their commanders to "command boldly and manage boldly." The actual results of the Luoyang Campaign have also proved that the correct implementation of military democracy is beneficial in every way. Therefore, it is wrong to distrust the masses and fear the masses, and it is a manifestation of irresponsibility to the revolution. Commanders at all levels should eliminate all personal concerns and treat military democracy with the same position and attitude as in the land reform study. This is the basic key to carrying out this movement.

Second, all commanders and fighters, especially lower-level cadres and soldiers, must deeply understand the constructiveness of military democracy. In actual practice, promote positive factors more and do not just make simple exposures and inquiries about errors and shortcomings. Every lower-level commander and fighter should regard themselves as a member of the entire combat sequence, each with their own share of responsibility in completing the entire combat task. Although the responsibilities are different in size, they are the same in being responsible to the Party and the people. Therefore, they should adopt a positive and well-intentioned attitude, offer opinions to higher-level commanders, and take into account the objective situation at the time and the different levels of each cadre. They should not only review past experiences and lessons, but more importantly, concentrate everyone's opinions, everyone's combat experience, wisdom, and creativity, find ways to improve tactics, and complete the task of annihilating the enemy with fewer casualties. They should not only criticize shortcomings, but also promote advantages. They should not only make improvement requests to higher-level commanders, but also review how they executed orders and completed tasks, what shortcomings they had in their own tactics and combat actions, and how they should improve in the future. They should not only pay attention to post-war reviews and implement "learn warfare through warfare," but also strive to study and strengthen management education in peacetime to achieve "prepare for war through education." They should not engage in general discussions about war, but should evaluate war based on major actual battles. The war situation is complex and changeable, and cadres are promoted too quickly and lack specialized school training. Military democracy has not been well developed in the past, and it is difficult for any individual to make absolutely correct commands. Even if higher-level commanders have correct commands, the task cannot be fully completed if lower-level commanders cannot execute them correctly or lack certain skills. Therefore, in military democracy, it is wrong to make simple exposures or only investigate superiors and not subordinates, blaming others and not oneself. It is even more wrong to use satire and abuse, or to use the shortcomings of higher-level commanders as an excuse to cover up one's own "life-saving ideology," disobey orders in wartime, and retaliate after the war. Mutual assistance and mutual love between superiors and subordinates, everything for the purpose of improving the combat effectiveness of the troops and completing the task of annihilating the enemy, is the spirit of military democracy and achieves the purpose of military democracy.

Third, correctly grasp democratic centralism. Democratic centralism is one of the principles of building our army. The essential difference between our army and other armies lies in the consistency of class nature, the unity of the entire army's position and goal of fighting for the revolution, with only a division of labor in duties and no distinction between rulers and the ruled. What we call democracy is democracy under centralized guidance, and centralization is centralization based on democracy. Military democracy is no exception. Party committees at all levels should conscientiously and responsibly lead this movement in an organized and planned manner. Oppose pure commandism, and also oppose formalism and tailism. Through the combination of the mass line—class line and hero model line—we seek to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of commanders and fighters. Commanders at all levels must emphasize the promotion of democracy themselves. Not only before and after the war, but even in the intervals of intense fighting, they should go deep among the masses with a spirit of wholeheartedly taking responsibility for the revolution, observe and experience the emotional changes of lower-level commanders and fighters, listen to and concentrate their opinions, and come up with ways to solve all the difficult problems encountered in the battle in a timely manner, so that their command can be closely combined with the vast masses and the actual combat situation. And lower-level commanders and fighters, on the one hand, should actively and responsibly offer opinions to improve command and improve management, and on the other hand, they must more consciously abide by discipline and obey orders, so as to achieve better centralized command and centralized management. Especially in battle, they should pay more attention to the centrality of command, reduce unnecessary concerns for commanders, increase their confidence in command, and thus fully complete the combat mission.

Fourth, military democracy must be universally and permanently implemented in all areas of military life on the basis of our army's excellent political conditions, and be closely integrated with political democracy and economic democracy. Because the implementation of military democracy must fully promote and improve the class consciousness and sense of responsibility for war of all commanders and fighters. All political workers should regard this as an important link in improving the combat effectiveness of the troops, attach importance to it, and participate in it personally, and strive to assist and ensure the development of military democracy, and use political work to ensure the improvement of military technology and tactics, while also checking wartime political work. All commanders should also pay attention to adopting the methods and means of political work to improve their military work, and break the old concept that military affairs are only about orders and only about command. The thinking and style of military democracy are complete and indivisible, so it must be fully implemented in the entire process of military management, military education, and combat in order to promote each other and firmly establish itself. Also, because many commanders in our army still lack democratic thinking and style, and lack experience in military democracy, it is inevitably a long-term and arduous process of transformation and construction. It should not be treated as a temporary movement to be rushed through, but should be adhered to persistently and unremittingly and become a system. Military democracy is a very important part of Chairman Mao's military thought, and no one can fully understand and apply it freely in a short period of time. Learning and promoting military democracy is the key to truly accepting Chairman Mao's military thought. Therefore, we should carry out the military democracy movement universally with the greatest enthusiasm and a high sense of responsibility to the Party and the people, and persist in and implement it for a long time, in order to complete a glorious task in the history of our army's construction.

　　开展军事民主的几个原则
    华东人民解放军政治部“人民前线报”社论
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线五日电】华东人民解放军政治部出版之人民前线报，顷以“开展军事民主的几个原则”为题发表社论称：经过土改学习运动，全军阶级觉悟普遍提高，部队情绪旺盛，气象为之一新。现在要在这一基础之上继续展开军事民主，并与实际战斗军事教育行政管理相结合，把政治民主、经济民主、军事民主连成一个整体，成为我军经常性的正常化的民主生活，民主作风，使阶级本质更高的发扬，战术与技术进一步的提高，以迎接新的伟大的胜利形势。这是我军建军史中具有头等重要意义的事件。为使军事民主顺利的正确的开展起来，特提出下列几点原则意见。
    第一，开展军事民主的关键，首先在于各级指挥员树立正确的军事民主观念，克服一部分指挥员中害怕军事民主的倾向。他们之中有的是自恃有经验、有战功，骄傲和自满，不愿或不敢正视自己的缺点和错误。有的是因为战争的需要提拔快，感觉能力不够，在军事民主中看到战士能出好主意，想好办法，因而顾虑自己的威信，怕以后不好指挥和领导。前者见于较高级的指挥员中，后者则普遍存在于连排干部中。他们虽或承认军事民主，也仅把它当作是方法方式问题，有的甚至根本否定，认为军事上不允许有民主。他们之所以这样，首先是由于他们片面的强调军事上的集中性，不了解每一个作战命令都是人民利益和广大指战员利益集中的表现，都是代表每一级组织的意图，是建立在最民主的基础之上的，这不是任何个人特权的表现，也不是任何个人包办得了的。一个命令的正确与否影响到战斗的胜利和失败，关连到人民和广大指战员的利益，以至于生命。因此实行军事民主是每一个指挥员对人民对同志对革命负责的表现，也是能否实行正确的指挥，能否完成党与人民付与的责任的一种严重的实际的考验。其次是由于他们习惯简单化的指挥方法，平时不学习，不注意部队建设与教育训练，战时不注意战前准备，不细致了解和分析敌情，而往往单凭个人勇敢，“一冲主义”认为军事民主会增加麻烦，战术技术不是一时能学好的，只要能打就行。他们不了解战争是一种高度的艺术，敌我双方集中了一切人力和物力，时刻寻求着对方的弱点，进行生死的斗争。同时又因作战对象时间地点条件的不同与变化迅速，任何一个聪明的有能力的指挥员也无法处处看的明白，事事照顾周到。但战斗又常因瞬息时机的掌握与微小条件的利用，而决定胜负。为补救这一缺陷，就只有实行军事民主，发扬全体指战员战斗的积极性，创造性，如果说要骄傲自满包办独挡，必然要犯主观主义的错误，而招致革命的损失。战争技术并不是神秘不可捉摸的东西。我军二十多年来生长壮大的历史中，所创造的伟大胜利的局面，证明我军广大指战员在革命战争中，有其特殊的创造，是能够掌握这种艺术的，最新的战术和技术也一定会被我们掌握起来的。再次还由于他们缺乏自我批评的勇气，害怕广大群众起来揭发他们的缺点和错误。他们知道在指挥作战中所犯的错误，其恶果更甚于一般工作中的错误，害怕战士会报复，或不再听指挥，他们不了解实行军事民主乃是为了求得全军战术与技术同获改造和提高，不是针对某一个人或一部分人过去的缺点和错误，单纯追求其责任，而在指挥员倾听群众意见，实行正确的自我批评改进战术指挥以后，其领导能力与信心必然会因之大大提高，军事民主对于我军也并非完全生疏的。早在一九四三年大练兵运动中，我军就实行了官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵的群众路线，革命战争中又创造了“小参谋会”“诸葛亮会”“评定伤亡”“评定技术”等军事教育方法。陈毅将军也曾屡次指示：“以战教战”，“打一仗进一步”，这一建军的基本要求。“军事民主”正是这一切的集中和发展。特别经过土改学习以后，广大战士觉悟提高，有的单位战士已自动要求指挥员“大胆指挥、大胆管理”，而洛阳战役中的实际效果也证明，正确实行军事民主是有百利无一害的。所以不相信群众，害怕群众都是错误的，乃是一种对革命不负责任的表现。各级指挥员都应排除一切个人顾虑，以土改学习的立场和态度来对待军事民主，这是开展这一运动的基本关键。
    第二，全体指战员，尤其是下层干部和战士，要深刻认识军事民主的建设性。在实际进行中多发扬积极因素，不要只对错误和缺点作单纯的揭发和追究。每一个下级指挥员和战士都应该把自己作成整个战斗序列中的一员来看待，在完成整个战斗任务中，各有自己一份责任，虽然责任有大小之分，而对党对人民负责是一样的。因此应采取积极的善意的态度，向上级指挥员提意见，并照顾到当时客观情况和每个干部的不同水准，不仅检讨过去的经验和教训，而且更重要的是集中大家的意见、大家的战斗经验、智慧和创造，找出改进战术的道路，以少的伤亡完满的完成歼敌任务，不光批评缺点，而且要发扬优点，不光向上级提出改进的要求，也要检讨自己是怎样的去执行命令、完成任务的，自己的战术和战斗动作上又有那些缺点，今后应当怎样去改进。不仅只注意战后检讨实行“以战教战”，平时就应努力学习，加强管理教育，做到“以教备战”。不是泛泛其谈来论战，而是要以主要的实际战斗来评战。战争情况复杂多变，加以干部提拔太快，又没有专门学校训练，军事民主过去又未很好展开，任何个人很难作到绝对正确的指挥，就是上级有了正确的指挥，下级不能正确的执行或缺乏一定的技术，也不能完满的完成战斗任务的。所以在军事民主中，仅作单纯的揭发或光查上不查下，责人不责己，是不对的，采取讽刺和谩骂，或借口上级指挥员的缺点而掩护自己的“保命思想”，战时不服从指挥，战后报复，更是错误的。必须上下一致互助、互爱，一切为了提高部队的战斗力，完成歼敌任务，才是军事民主的精神，才达到军事民主的目的。
    第三，正确掌握民主集中制，民主集中制是我军的建军原则之一。我军与其他军队本质的不同，就在于阶级性的一致，全军上下为革命奋斗的立场和目标一致，只有职务的分工，没有统治者与被统治者的区别。我们所谓民主是集中指导下的民主，集中是民主基础上的集中，军事民主亦不例外。各级党委应当认真负责有组织、有计划的领导这一运动。反对单纯命令主义，也反对形式主义与尾巴主义，通过群众路线——阶级路线与英模路线的结合，求得发扬广大指战员的积极性和创造性。各级指挥员必须自我强调发扬民主，不仅战前和战后，即在紧张战斗的间隙，都应以全心全意对革命负责的精神，深入群众，观察和体验下级指战员的情绪变化，倾听和集中他们的意见，及时想出办法，解决战斗中所遇到的一切困难问题，使自己的指挥与广大群众及战斗实际紧密的结合。而下级指战员一面应积极负责提出意见，改进指挥，改进管理，一面则必须更加自觉的遵守纪律，服从命令，达到更好的集中指挥与集中管理的目的，特别在战斗中应更多照顾指挥上的集中性，减少指挥员不必要的顾虑，增加其指挥信心，来完满的完成战斗任务。
    第四，军事民主，必须在我军优良的政治条件之上，普遍的长期的贯彻到全部军事生活的领域之中，并与政治民主、经济民主紧密的结合。因为实行军事民主必须充分发扬和提高全体指战员的阶级觉悟和对战争的责任心。一切政工人员应当把这当作提高部队战斗力的重要环节，来重视并亲自参加，努力协助与保证军事民主的开展，用政治工作来保证军事技术战术的提高，同时连系检查战时政治工作。一切指挥员也应当注意采用政治工作的方法方式，以改进自己的军事工作，打破军事就只有命令，就只管指挥的陈旧观念。军事民主的思想和作风又是完整而不容分割的，因此它又必须全面的贯彻到军事管理、军事教育和作战的全过程中去，才能相互推动，牢固的树立起来。又由于我军不少指挥员还缺乏民主思想与作风，还缺乏军事民主的经验，因此他又必然是一个长期的艰苦的改造过程和建设的过程，不应当作一时的运动来突击，而要经久不懈的坚持下去，成为一种制度。军事民主是毛主席军事思想中极重要的一部分，任何人不能在短期中完全体会和运用自如，而学习和发扬军事民主又是能否真正接受毛主席军事思想的关键。所以我们应以对党对人民的最大热忱和高度责任心，把军事民主运动普遍开展起来，长期的坚持与贯彻下去，以完成我军建军史上一个光荣的任务。（完）
