[Jilu Yu News] The Hua County Party Committee, according to the spirit of the District Committee's deviation correction, held an enlarged meeting of cadres in the county to examine incorrect understandings of policy. The main problems identified were as follows: (1) Regarding the resettlement of landlords, it was thought that landlords could be left with enough land to maintain their livelihoods; however, it was thought that the landlords' industry and commerce did not need to be returned, or only a little needed to be returned. For example, if a landlord had a pharmacy and an oil mill, it was thought that returning the pharmacy would be enough to maintain his livelihood, and the oil mill did not need to be returned. "If we return it to him, will he hire a shopkeeper and several clerks? Then he will be able to eat, drink, and show off again." Some comrades said: "We cannot completely return it to him. For example, if an oil mill has several shares, that's it." (2) It was believed that the masses were managing well, and if it was returned to the landlords, they would not be interested in managing it, or would not be able to employ people, and it would collapse, which was not in line with the policy of developing industry and commerce. Moreover, the masses are not incapable of managing it. (3) It was thought that not engaging in personal management, but only investing shares, did not count as industry and commerce; even if it was returned to them, they could not be allowed to invest shares or sell furniture; it was thought that returning industry and commerce was pouring cold water on the masses. Of course, it was wrong to struggle against industry and commerce in the past, but since it has already been struggled against, both sides should be taken care of, and only part should be returned. (4) Some cadres were unwilling to discuss the Party's policy on industry and commerce. "Everyone understands the big principles." They regarded the Party's policy as empty rhetoric. Some emphasized that it was difficult for village cadres and the masses to understand. Some individual cadres even said: "I will never understand it, even if I die." (5) They were afraid to boldly publicize the policy on middle peasants, thinking that it was enough for the cadres to know. They were afraid that if the middle peasants knew, they would all come and there would be no way to compensate them. Some said: "We only struggle against middle peasants when they have made mistakes, and those who have been struggled against have made some mistakes." Based on the above erroneous understandings, the county party committee meeting proposed: (1) There should be no excuses or distortions, taking advantage of loopholes, delays, or hesitations on policy issues. The Party's policy is concrete and is determined according to specific circumstances, not just empty rhetoric. It must be resolutely implemented, and we must not be afraid of trouble. If problems are found, they must be reported immediately and corrected. (2) Our policy must be repeatedly publicized among the masses so that they all understand it. Industry and commerce should first return what has not been divided and what has been divided but not yet consumed. If the individual cannot manage it after returning it, they can operate it jointly. The idea of not cooperating with landlords is also incorrect. Since it is returned, it belongs to them, and they have the right to pledge shares or sell it. We must educate the masses to implement the Party's policy from the perspective of long-term interests, not to pour cold water on the masses, nor to be the tail of the masses. Middle peasants who have made mistakes can be criticized, but they cannot be left uncompensated. If middle peasants who have been wrongly struggled against flee, and their land is divided among the masses and planted with wheat, if the fleeing middle peasants return and cannot survive, the land can be returned to them, but the grain needs to be divided in half or four-six.

### 滑县县委召开扩大干部会　克服抵抗纠偏思想

　　滑县县委召开扩大干部会
  　克服抵抗纠偏思想
    【冀鲁豫消息】滑县县委根据地委会纠偏的精神，召开全县干部扩大会，检查对政策不正确的认识。检查出主要有如下几个问题：（一）在安置地主上，认为可以给地主留足以维持生活的土地；但地主的工商业就认为不用再退，或退一点就行。如有的地主有个药铺，也有油坊，就认为退给他一个药铺也可以维持生活了，油坊不用再退了。“退给他还叫他雇个掌柜的，雇上几个店员吗？这样可又该他吃喝抖啦。”有的同志说：“不能完全退给他，好比一个油坊，算有他的几股完啦。”（二）认为群众经营得好好的，退给地主没心经营，或用不下人，就得垮台，不合乎发展工商业的政策。而且群众又不是不会经营。（三）认为不亲自经营，光投股，不算工商业；就是退他，也不能叫他投股，卖家具；认为退工商业是给群众泼冷水。过去斗工商业当然不对，但已经斗啦，应该两边照顾，只退一部分。（四）有些干部对党的工商业政策不愿讨论。“大道理谁都通。”把党的政策看作空洞的大道理。有的强调村干群众难通。甚至有个别干部这样说：“我死也通不了。”（五）对中农政策不敢大胆宣传，认为光干部知道就行啦。怕中农知道了都找来没办法补偿。有的说：“中农有错误才斗他，是斗的都有点错。”根据以上错误认识，县委会议提出：（一）在政策问题上不得有任何借口或曲解、钻空子拖延犹豫。党的政策是具体的，是根据具体情况确定的，不是单纯的大道理。一定要坚决执行，不能怕麻烦。发现问题要马上报告，求得纠正。（二）要在群众中反复宣传我们的政策，使群众都了解。工商业应先退还没分的和分了尚未消耗的。如退还后本人不能经营，可合伙经营。不与地主合伙经营的思想也是不对的。既然退还，就是人家的了，人家有权押股或出卖。要从远大利益上教育群众执行党的政策，不是对群众泼冷水，也不能做群众的尾巴。中农有错的可以批评，但不能不补偿。错斗中农逃亡后，地被分给群众，种上了麦子，逃亡中农回来，有没法过的，可退给中农，但需对半或四六分粮。
