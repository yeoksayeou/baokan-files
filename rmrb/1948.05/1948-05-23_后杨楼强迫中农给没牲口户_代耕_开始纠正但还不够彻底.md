[Jilu Yu News] The Henan General Branch reported: Hou Yanglou Village, Nanwang First District, harmed the interests of middle peasants during the spring plowing. After middle and poor peasants held a forum, they initially improved their mutual relations and began to compensate for the losses of the middle peasants. On April 20th, village cadres ordered all middle peasants in the village with livestock to "cultivate on behalf" of households without livestock, and at a village meeting, they called on people to report their difficulties. Sixteen households reported difficulties, totaling sixty-five mu of land, with a plan to finish plowing in three days. After comrades from the Prefectural Committee working group discovered this situation, they asked the masses at a village meeting mobilizing for anti-mopping up and rush planting what inappropriate things had happened during the spring plowing. A middle peasant said, "Those who raise livestock lack grass and feed, and those who don't raise livestock can also cultivate the land, so it's better to sell the livestock." A poor peasant said, "Since people have cultivated the land for us, we should give them something in return; we should treat them as they treat us." The problem was not resolved. The next day, a forum for middle and poor peasants was held, with more than forty people attending, to discuss war preparedness and mutual aid. They were divided into two groups for discussion. One middle peasant said, "It's not a big deal for us to 'cultivate on behalf,' but they don't even lift a finger." Some poor peasants suggested giving the middle peasants livestock grass. Then the middle peasants said that if they wanted other people's grass, they couldn't buy or sell livestock casually, and they felt that exchanging labor wasn't a good idea either. The poor peasant Yan Lin said, "Forget it, let everyone find someone suitable for them. Land has never been left uncultivated before." The cadres enlightened them, saying, "Has land never been left uncultivated? There's a big difference between planting early and planting late!" After that, they discussed how to exchange labor. Someone suggested giving sorghum leaves to livestock for planting sorghum fields and wheat bran for wheat fields. The middle peasant Zhou Shaolin said, "I can contribute my labor, so ask for less." Some also said they didn't want anything. After compensating each other in this way, the relations between middle and poor peasants in this village have begun to improve. However, compensating the middle peasants' losses is still not thorough enough, and some middle peasants still have concerns. We should also educate village cadres and the masses to understand the policy towards middle peasants, emphasize equivalent exchange, and thoroughly correct the phenomenon of harming the interests of middle peasants.

　　后杨楼强迫中农给没牲口户“代耕”
  　开始纠正但还不够彻底
    【冀鲁豫消息】河南总支社报导：南旺一区后杨楼村在春耕中伤害中农利益，经中贫农开会座谈，初步改善相互关系，开始弥补了中农的损失。四月二十日村干命令全村中农牲口给没牲口的户“代耕”，并在村民会上号召自报困难，共报了十六户，六十五亩地，计划三天耕完。这个情况被地委工作团同志发觉后，就在动员反扫荡和抢种的村民大会上，叫群众提春耕中有啥不合适的事。一个中农说：“喂牲口少草无料的，不喂牲口也能种地，不如把牲口卖了。”一个贫农说：“人家把地种啦，也该给些啥，人家怎着咱怎着。”问题没解决。第二天开中贫农座谈会，共到四十多个人，谈备战互助问题，分开两个小组讨论，一个中农说：“本来咱给‘代耕’地倒没有啥，可是他们连手也不动。”有的贫农提出给中农牲口草。接着中农说咱要人家的草，以后买卖牲口不随便啦，研究换工又觉不好换。贫农阎林说：“算啦，谁跟谁合适找谁的吧。从前也没有荒了地。”干部启发说：“没有荒了地？种早种晚可差劲啦！”以后就讨论如何换工，有人提出种高粱地给牲口高粱叶，麦子地给麦糠草等。中农周少林说：“我能出力，少要点吧。”也有说啥也不要的。这样座谈补偿后，这村的中贫农关系已开始改善。但弥补中农损失还是不彻底，有些中农仍有顾虑。还应教育村干群众使其了解中农政策，强调等价交换，彻底纠正伤害中农利益现象。
