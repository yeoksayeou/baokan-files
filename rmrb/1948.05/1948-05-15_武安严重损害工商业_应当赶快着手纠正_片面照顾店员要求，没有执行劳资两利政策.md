[This newspaper's news] The Sixth Inspection Group of the Taihang District Clearance Committee conducted a preliminary inspection of Wu'an's implementation of the Party's policy on industry and commerce. They believe that the Chengguan District of Wu'an completely violated the Party's policy guidelines of protecting industry and commerce, developing production, prospering the economy, benefiting both labor and capital, taking into account both public and private interests, and free trade. They adopted a suicidal policy, completely eliminating private industry and commerce, suffocating the city, and committing serious leftist adventurist errors. In December 1945 and March 1946, two campaigns were launched for shop assistants to receive supplementary wages and pay raises, one-sidedly catering to the demands of shop assistants without correctly implementing the "benefit to both labor and capital" policy. Initially, shop assistants were asked to calculate how production was making money and to calculate the exploitation account of the manager. A worker in a certain sauce garden calculated the shopkeeper's twenty-year exploitation account and gave the sauce garden to six shop assistants. A flour miller in 14th Street, who had worked for less than a year, calculated that the shopkeeper owed him a donkey. At that time, wages were not only increased but also the previous wages were made up. Based on the size of the business and the degree of suffering of the shop assistants, the amount of compensation was determined for three to five years. After the wage increase, the shop assistants could not directly ask their shopkeepers for it, but the shop assistant picket team would demand it with guns, and if it was not given, they would take things. Fines were also very common. The shop assistant union educated the shop assistants not to get up early, and anyone who did would be fined for buying fried dough sticks. As a result, industry and commerce gradually declined and shrunk, and eleven large stores ran away from the city. Before the May 1947 mass movement, the struggle against industry and commerce continued sporadically. By the time of the May mass movement, private industry and commerce was finally and completely eliminated. The slogans at the time were: "Destroy the feudal old economy, build a democratic new market," "Knock down the feudal pillboxes (referring to industry and commerce), completely eliminate feudal property, and transform feudal business into people's business," "Shop assistants become shopkeepers, everyone becomes the owner." They forcibly forced businessmen to return home to participate in agricultural labor, which was called "proletarian tempering." In this mass movement, a total of 73 households of self-owned and managed shops and small handicraft workshops employing shop assistants or jointly operated were struggled against, and another 10 households, including foreign cloth shops, were confiscated by the government.

    *Government Production Annexes Private Stores:*

    A certain pharmacy in 6th Street was operated jointly with the county government after liberation, and private investment was not allowed. Private funds were withdrawn, and it became completely government-run. A cigarette and sundry store occupied the house of the business office. The business office was willing to partner with him, but he was unwilling, so they forced him to move out of the house. Having no choice, he had to partner. A certain noodle shop used to be operated by three private shareholders, but later it partnered with the Wuxing Factory (government-run business) in 5th Street, and as a result, the other party withdrew their shares and annexed them. This kind of annexation occurred in seven stores in 6th Street alone, and many small vendors and shop assistants in other streets were also struggled against. Preliminary investigations in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 14th streets revealed that a total of 15 steamed bun shops, small grocery stalls, and meat shops had been struggled against. All of them had no land and relied solely on small businesses to maintain their families. The reasons for the struggle were unpaid debts, unreturned borrowed items, verbal and physical abuse, refusal to give credit, lending at usurious rates, serving as puppet soldiers, etc. Some were caught in the process of digging air-raid shelters. The struggle against stores also involved shop assistants. Liu Xiaoshuan, an old couple in 14th Street, made a living selling candy, but they could not eat or drink if they didn't make a sale, but the street treated them as landlords because their son had once saved silver dollars for the landlord in the store.

    *Advocating and Encouraging Unreasonable Labor-Capital Mutual Aid Groups:* There are several situations in mutual aid groups: One is that they have their own funds and technology, combined with auxiliary labor in the family. The family members work and eat in the store without paying wages, and they want to develop freely. But they are afraid of being said to be selfish, afraid of being said to be not serving the masses, and afraid of getting into trouble. Generally, they find relatives of martyrs or government-run production units to rely on and hang up signs such as "Government-Run Production," "Mass Production," "Relatives of Martyrs Production," "Mutual Aid Production," "Poor and Hired Peasants Production," "Cooperative Production," and "Small-Scale Mutual Aid" to support their facades. The Pang Hetais family of five in 9th Street had no land and supported their families by selling mutton soup. When cadres organized them into agricultural mutual aid groups, they said he was a middle peasant and insisted that he participate in mutual aid with Li Dacun. In addition to giving Li Dacun two catties of rice a day as wages, the rest of the profits were distributed to the mutual aid group. Before August 15th of last year, he earned 18,000 yuan and handed it over to the political director Mi Erkui without any dividends. Later, Pang Hetais became insane. At the self-criticism meeting in January, they said he was selfish, and he was afraid and jumped into a well and died. There are also those who are placed as unemployed citizens: cadres send them into mutual aid groups, regardless of whether they have technology or labor, and they must provide them with living expenses. There are also small businessmen who have been struggled against who are afraid of hanging up signs and participate in mutual aid groups with very low wages. Some are unwilling to attend meetings or go on errands for fear of getting into trouble. Hanging up a government-run production sign supports the facade. Fuhua Meat Shop hung up a sign in July 1946 and distributed 400,000 yuan in dividends in January last year. Fuxingchang Clothing Bureau distributed 40,000 yuan for a sign. These people feel that mutual aid is not worthwhile, and they are afraid of being unsafe if they don't engage in mutual aid, so their general mood is low.

    Due to the implementation of the erroneous policy of struggling against industry and commerce, the development of private capital has been suppressed, which has affected everyone to this day, who dare not move forward and do not believe in the Party's policies, saying that what we say and what we do are completely different. Because industry and commerce cannot develop, it has caused many difficulties for farmers to develop production. Many poor people who rely on industry and commerce for their livelihoods have lost their jobs. Small vendors say that their backers have been destroyed. A sugar workshop in 2nd Street developed from 200,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan and dared not do anything more. The market circulation is sluggish, lifeless, unable to meet the needs of the peasant masses, and affects the development of the entire production.

    *Editor's Note:* The Taihang Qingwei Committee has conducted such a relatively in-depth inspection of Wu'an's implementation of the industrial and commercial policy, pointing out where the errors lie, which is of great benefit to Wu'an in correcting its errors. The leading comrades in Wu'an should also express their opinions on this inspection. We believe that the industrial and commercial problems in Wu'an are indeed relatively serious, and the leading comrades must make the greatest efforts to resolutely correct them according to the central bureau's guiding principles on industry and commerce. Those that have not been distributed should be returned intact; those that have been distributed should be appropriately compensated by the government through loans or other methods so that they can resume business. The comrades of the Taihang Qingwei Committee should also do their utmost to help, so that Wu'an's industry and commerce can recover and prosper as soon as possible.

    武安严重损害工商业
    应当赶快着手纠正
    片面照顾店员要求，没有执行劳资两利政策
    【本报消息】太行区清委会第六检查组对武安执行党的工商业政策做了初步检查，认为武安城关区完全违背了党的保护工商业、发展生产、繁荣经济、劳资两利、公私兼顾、自由贸易的政策方针。他们采用了自杀政策，彻底消灭了私人工商业，窒息了城市，犯了严重的左倾冒险主义错误。四五年十二月、四六年三月两次发动店员补资增资运动，片面照顾店员要求，没有正确的执行“劳资两利”政策。开始时叫店员算生产是如何赚钱的，算经理的剥削帐。某酱园工人算掌柜的二十年剥削帐，把酱园算给六个店员。十四街某面房磨官工作不到一年，算了掌柜一个驴。当时一面增资，一面又把以前工资补起来。根据买卖大小店员受苦大小，确定了三年到五年的补资。增资后，店员不能向自己掌柜直接要，而由店员纠察队拿着枪要，不给即拿东西。罚款现象也很严重。店员工会教育店员不能起早，谁起早了罚他买油条。结果，工商业日渐消沉萎缩，全城跑了十一家大商店。四七年五月大运动前，仍零星不断斗争工商业，到五月大运动时，就最后彻底干脆的把私人工商业消灭了。当时的口号是：“摧垮封建旧经济，建设民主新市场”，“打垮封建炮楼（指工商业），彻底消灭封建财产，变封建生意为人民生意”，“伙友当掌柜，个个当东家”。他们硬逼着商人回家参加农业劳动，这叫“无产阶级锻炼”。在这个大运动中，斗争了自东自掌与雇佣店员的或合伙经营的商店、小手工业作坊共七十三户，另有经政府没收的洋布庄等共十户。
    机关生产吞并私人商店
    机关生产吞并私人商店：
    六街某药铺，解放后给县政府合伙经营，不许私人入股，把私人资金抽回，完全成了机关生产。一个纸烟杂货铺占着经营处房子，经营处愿和他合伙，他不愿意，就逼他搬房子，逼得无办法，只得合伙。某粉店过去是私人三家集股经营的，后来与五街同兴工厂（机关买卖）合伙，结果叫人家把股抽了，吞并了人家。这样吞并的情形，仅六街就有七家，还有不少街也斗争了小商贩店员。一、二、三、十四四个街初步了解，被斗争过的馍馍铺、小杂货摊、酒肉铺，共十五户。都是没有土地，专靠小本生意维持家庭生活。斗争的原因，因欠钱未付，借物未还，打骂过人，不赊帐，放小高利贷，当过伪军等等，有的是挖防空洞时被捎带了。斗争商店捎带了店员的也有。十四街刘小拴老两口，卖糖过日子，闹不来就吃喝不上，但街上按地主对待，理由是他儿子曾在商店给地主保存过现洋。
    提倡和鼓励不合理的劳资互助组：互助组有几种情况：一种是自己有资金、有技术，结合家中辅助劳力，家中人做在里，吃在里，不开支工资，要求自由发展。但怕说自私自利，怕说不为群众服务，怕出事，一般都找抗属、机关生产当靠山，挂个“机关生产”、“群众生产”、“抗属生产”、“互助生产”、“贫雇生产”、“合作生产”、“小型互助”等招牌，以支应门面。九街庞和太家五口人，无地，自己卖羊汤养活家，干部按农业互助组办法编组时说他是个中农，非叫他和李大存互助不行，每天他给李大存二斤米的工资除外，剩下的交互助组分红。去年八月十五前赚一万八千元，交给政治主任米二奎也没分红。以后庞和太就疯疯傻傻起来。一月间互助组开检讨会，说他自私自利，他怕了，就跳井死了。还有是安插失业市民：干部把他们派进互助里，不管他有没有技术劳力，总得叫给生活。还有被斗的小商人怕挂牌，参加到互助组里，工资很低，有的不愿开会支差，怕出岔子。挂个机关生产的牌子，支应门面、复华肉铺四六年七月间挂一个牌，去年一月分了他四十万元红利。复兴昌成衣局一个牌分了四万元。这些人感到互助不合算，不互助又怕不保险，一般情绪低落。
    由于执行了错误的斗争工商业政策，打击了私人资本的发展，一直影响到今天谁也裹足不前，不相信党的政策，说我们说的和做的完全两样。因为工商业的不能发展，给农民发展生产造成许多困难。许多依靠工商业生活的贫民失了业，现在有三千多人的生活没有保障，小摊贩说是把他们的后台搞垮了。二街一个糖坊由二十万元发展到三十万元再也不敢闹了。市场周转不灵，死气沉沉，满足不了农民群众的需要，影响了整个生产的发展。
    编者意见：太行清委会对武安执行工商业政策做了这样比较深刻的检查，指出错误所在，对武安改正错误有很大好处。武安领导同志对于这个检查，亦应表示自己的意见，我们认为武安工商业问题确实比较严重，领导同志必须以最大努力根据中央局工商业指示原则坚决加以纠正，未分配的，原封退还；已分配的，政府应设法以贷款或其他方法适当补偿，使能恢复营业。太行清委会同志也应尽最大力量予以帮助，使武安工商业早日恢复繁荣。
