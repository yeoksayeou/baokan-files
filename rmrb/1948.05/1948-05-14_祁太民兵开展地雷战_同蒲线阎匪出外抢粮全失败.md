Qi County Zhang Ge, Gu County, and Yuan Taigou, more than a hundred Yan bandits in two groups harassed our border areas, attempting to seize grain. One group advanced to Rencun and Hu Jianying, where they were immediately blocked by the militia of the Zhong Ge Liang joint defense; the enemy then advanced to the Bai Si Ling and Fu Ping areas, where they were again attacked by the militia of the Dong Ge Liang joint defense, resulting in three enemy soldiers killed or wounded, and the enemy fled in panic.

More than a hundred enemies from Xiangyuan Village in Pingyao, on the evening of the 26th, raided Duanjiaping Village in our Second District. While passing through Dazhuang, they triggered two landmines, killing and wounding one enemy each. When the enemy advanced to Duanjiaping, they triggered another landmine, again killing and wounding one enemy each. After the enemy opened fire, the militia quickly launched an attack, covering the safe evacuation of the masses.

[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 10th] The Taigu militia, combining local armed forces with blocking warfare and landmine warfare, repelled the Yan bandit's "flood-like" offensive. On the 29th of last month, Yan bandits, with three regiments of troops, launched a "flood-like" intrusion into villages in the third, sixth, and seventh districts of the county. Our local armed forces and the militia from the above areas immediately launched a widespread counter-"flood" offensive. Under the explosions of our landmines and blocking warfare, the Yan bandits fled back in disarray the next day. This landmine warfare was a great threat to the enemy, with more than twenty explosions in succession, known to have killed or wounded six enemies. When the enemy advanced to a certain area to loot, we immediately attacked their flanks. This prevented the enemy from running amok, and the command headquarters did not dare to stay, quickly retreating. After the end of the counter-"flood" sweep, the county command headquarters summarized the experience as follows: Emptying the houses and clearing the fields must be done first, so that when the enemy comes, the people can be quickly evacuated. In terms of evacuation, retreat, and external operations, if it is discovered that the enemy is launching a large-scale "flood," a decision should be made to organize the masses to evacuate and retreat, and withdraw from the enemy's encirclement. On the militia side, it is necessary to resolutely withdraw from the enemy's pincers encirclement, see the situation clearly, and then engage the enemy, or turn to the enemy's rear. The militia under the control of the rear headquarters should take the initiative to come out and engage the enemy. For example, the Bai Bi Village militia covered the people in the rear in this way. In addition, preparations should be made at all times, constantly grasping the enemy's situation changes, and villages should exchange intelligence with each other, and not be paralyzed. When the enemy attacked this time, some villages thought it was a small enemy raid, did not prepare, and did not scout. The enemy advanced, and the people ran in confusion, which may have caused losses.

    祁太民兵开展地雷战
    同蒲线阎匪出外抢粮全失败
    【本报消息】祁县张各、古县、元台沟之阎匪百多人，分两路向我边地进扰企图抢粮，一路进至任村、胡兼营，即遭我中圪梁联防民兵之阻击；敌复进至白寺岭、伏坪一带，又遭我东圪梁联防民兵之袭击，打死打伤敌三名，敌即仓慌逃去。
    平遥襄垣村敌百余人，于二十六日晚奔袭我二区段家坪村，路经大庄踏响地雷两颗，炸死炸伤敌各一名。当敌进至段家坪时，又踏响地雷一颗，又炸死炸伤敌各一。待敌打响后，民兵迅即出击，掩护群众安全转移出来。
    【本报太行十日电】太谷民兵地方武装堵击战和地雷战相结合，打退阎匪“水漫”进攻。上月二十九日阎匪以三个团的兵力，“水漫”式窜犯该县三、六、七区等村，我地方武装和上述各地民兵，当即普遍开展反“水漫”出击，阎匪在我地雷爆炸与堵击战下，于第二天即狼狈逃回。这次地雷战对敌威胁很大，先后爆炸二十余个，已知杀伤敌人六个。当敌人进到某一地区进行抢劫时，我即绕击其侧背。使敌不敢乱窜，指挥部也不敢停留，迅速后退。反“水漫”扫荡结束后，该县指挥部总结出经验是：空室清野必须先做好，敌人一来，即可迅速转移。在转移退却与外线作战上，如一发觉敌人是大股的“水漫”，就应决心组织群众转移退却，并撤出敌人的包围圈。在民兵方面，一定要坚决退出敌人钳击包围圈，看清情况，然后接敌活动，或转向敌后。后线指挥部掌握的民兵，要主动打出来，接敌活动。如白壁村民兵就是这样掩护了后边群众。另外应时时作准备，经常掌握敌情变化，各村互通情报，不要麻痹。这次敌人进攻时，有些村以为是敌人小出击，不作准备，不去侦察，敌人前进，跑的很混乱，就可能吃亏。
