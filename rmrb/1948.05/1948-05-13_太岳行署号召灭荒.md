    Taiyue Administrative Office Calls for Eliminating Wasteland
    [Taiyue News] The Taiyue Administrative Office issued instructions on the 6th to all commissioners and county heads to eliminate cultivated wasteland without increasing burdens. The instructions stated: Currently, some areas have a lot of land left behind by households who have moved away, as well as public land, school land, and public orchard land that has not been distributed. Because of a shortage of labor and draft animals, and because the masses have ideological concerns, they are not properly engaged in production, and new land has become wasteland this year. Anze has over 50,000 mu of wasteland, Tunliu has nearly 20,000 mu, and it is estimated that other counties will also have some. Together with last year's cultivated wasteland, the entire area has approximately 150,000 to 200,000 mu. This is a major problem that should attract the attention of all our comrades. We must immediately begin checking, clarify the main reasons for the newly deserted land, dispel the masses' fears of getting rich and of struggle, solve the difficulties faced by poor peasants and hired laborers in cultivating more land, vigorously organize the masses to eliminate wasteland, and call for planting more late autumn crops and vegetables, so as to ensure that not a single mu of new land becomes wasteland. To this end, several incentive measures have been decided: (1) Any individual or mutual aid group, regardless, who not only cultivates their own land well but also eliminates wasteland belonging to others, will not be burdened with any taxes or levies this year. This also applies to landlords and rich peasants (except for the land formally allocated to landlords and rich peasants). (2) In areas with more land than people, where there are individuals or mutual aid groups of the masses who abandon their own poor land to eliminate good wasteland, regardless of how much grain they harvest, they will be burdened according to the assessed yield of their original land last year, and the extra grain harvested will not be taxed (except for land distributed during the emancipation).

    太岳行署号召灭荒
    【太岳消息】太岳行署六日指示各专员、县长消灭熟荒，不出负担。上面说：现在有一部分地区留下许多外出户土地、和分配不出去的公地、学田、公共果实地。因为劳畜力缺少，群众思想上有顾虑，不好好生产，今年又新荒了地。安泽荒地在五万亩以上，屯留将近二万亩，旁的县估计也会有。连同去年熟荒，全区大约在十五万到二十万亩。这是很大问题，应引起我全体同志注意。立即动手检查，搞清新荒的地主要原因，解除群众怕发财、怕斗争的心病，解决贫雇农多种地的困难，大力组织群众消灭荒地，号召多种晚秋晚菜，做到不新荒一亩地。为此，并决定几项奖励办法：（一）不论任何个人或互助组，除将自己土地种好，又能消灭别人荒地的，今年一律不负担。地主富农也一样（给地主富农正式分的留的地在外）。（二）在地多人少，种不过来的地区，有丢掉自己坏地消灭好荒地的群众个人或互助组，不管收粮多少，都按去年原有土地评议产量负担，多收下的粮食不负担（翻身分的地在外）。
