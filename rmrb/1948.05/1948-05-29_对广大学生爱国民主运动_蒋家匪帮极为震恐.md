Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Reports from various sources indicate that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is extremely shocked by the patriotic democratic movement of students in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places last week. The Kuomintang's Nanjing Central Daily News published editorials on the 12th and 23rd, calling on the bandit gang to "engage in a life-or-death struggle" with patriotic students and to "take the knife and cut." Chen Xueping, the head of the "Youth Department" and a special agent, threatened the students on the 22nd with a threatening tone, saying, "If this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable." The bandit Ministry of Education sent urgent telegrams to the presidents of Central University and Jinling University twice on the 22nd and 23rd, ordering them to "swiftly stop" the students' actions and "deal with them accordingly." Sun Lianzhong, the commander of the Nanjing Garrison, continuously issued threatening talks and re-promulgated the "Regulations on Punishing Crimes Endangering the State During the Period of Suppression of Rebellion" and the "Provisional Measures for Maintaining Social Order," which had long been hated by the people, in an attempt to prevent the students' just struggle. According to incomplete reports from Chinese and foreign news agencies, since the opening of Chiang's so-called "Constitutional National Congress," more than 180 students have been arrested by Chiang's bandits in Ping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Xianyang and other places alone, and more than 40 have been injured. Those who died from injuries or were secretly arrested and killed are not included. However, this kind of desperate suppression by Chiang's bandits cannot stop the heroic and resourceful just struggle of the students in the Chiang-controlled areas.

　　对广大学生爱国民主运动
  　蒋家匪帮极为震恐
    【新华社陕北廿六电】据各方报导：蒋介石匪帮对于上周宁沪等地广大学生爱国民主运动，极为震惊。国民党南京中央日报于十二日、二十三日两次发表社论，号召匪帮与爱国学生“作生死斗争”，要“操刀一割”。蒋党“青年部”长特务头子陈雪屏，二十二日以威胁口吻恫吓学生说：“长此以往，其后果不堪设想”。匪教育部二十二日、二十三日两度急电中央、金大两校校长，命令他们对学生的行动“迅即制止”，“并予处办”。匪南京卫戍总司令孙连仲连续发表恫吓性谈话，并将其早已为人民所愤恨的反革命工具“戡乱时期危害国家紧急治罪条例”及“维持社会秩序临时办法”重加公布，企图阻遏学生正义斗争。按自蒋匪所谓“行宪国大”开幕迄今，据中外通讯社不完整报导统计，仅平、津、宁、沪、成都、咸阳等地，即有学生一百八十人以上曾遭蒋匪逮捕，四十余人受伤，因伤致死或被秘密逮捕及杀害者，尚不在内。但蒋匪此种垂死前的疯狂镇压，决不能阻止蒋区学生英勇机智的正义斗争。
