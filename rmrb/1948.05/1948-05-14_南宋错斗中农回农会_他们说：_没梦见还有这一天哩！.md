    Nansong, Middle Peasants Wrongly Accused are Returned to the Peasant Association.
    They Said: "We Never Dreamed This Day Would Come!"
    [Changzhi News] In Nansong, the Fifth District of Changzhi, the land reform last year was very chaotic, harming many middle peasants. They were given bad land and forced to provide unpaid labor, making it impossible for them to live. Although wages are now unified with those of the peasants, they still face difficulties because they lose time working for others, their own land is poor, and they lack resources for cultivation, and these problems have not been resolved in a timely manner. Cadres and activists are unwilling to correct the errors, and they have these ideas: (1) They are afraid of losing face. The civil affairs director said: "We struggled against them the year before last, and now we have to take care of them. It's like pooping and then eating it again. I'd be ashamed to death." (2) They are afraid of returning the fruits of struggle. (3) They are afraid of revenge. Chen Erze said: "The targets of struggle in our village haven't bowed their heads, and now we're taking care of them. I'll never admit it." Some said: "In the past, the district cadres told us to struggle against them, but now they say we struggled against them wrongly." In light of these ideas, on April 28, a meeting of more than 160 cadres and masses was convened to explain the policies in detail, and a branch meeting was held to explain that Communist Party members should know how to admit and correct mistakes, and boldly criticize themselves to the masses in order to improve our prestige. After four days of deliberation in the dining hall and in the fields, everyone realized that it should be corrected. Poor peasant Chen Erze said, "In the past, we were digging our own graves with our own hoes, and everyone was hurting each other." After each group had fully discussed the matter, a general meeting was held, and everyone unanimously agreed to correct the wrong accusations against 16 households, including middle peasant Wang Zengqi. It was also agreed to compensate five households, including poor peasant Wang Xiaoji. In the past, they were all vaguely called "targets of struggle," and the political pressure on them was very intense. This time, at the mass meeting, both sides exchanged heartfelt words and removed the title of "target of struggle." That evening, the masses allowed them to attend the meeting and restored their political rights. They also discussed that five households were currently without food, and that 85,000 yuan had been collected last year during the financial rectification, so they would temporarily use that to solve their difficulties. Landlords and rich peasants were also paid wages and lent seeds, and the difficulties of 12 households were resolved according to their specific circumstances. Now most of the land has been sown, and plans are being made for them to participate in transportation and blacksmithing and other sideline production. Meng Pangze, a middle peasant who was wrongly accused, said: "I never dreamed this day would come. Now we can produce well." After correcting these deviations, more than 2,900 mu of the village's more than 3,600 mu of autumn land have now been sown. The masses unanimously plan to strive to complete all sowing by the first day of the fourth lunar month. Some livestock are now being prepared for transportation to Yangcheng and Yuncheng, and the enthusiasm for production is high.

    南宋错斗中农回农会
    他们说：“没梦见还有这一天哩！”
    【长治消息】长治五区南宋，在去年土地改革中斗的很乱，损害不少中农。给他们分坏地，给农民无偿劳动等，弄的无法生活。现虽和农民工资统一，但是除了给别人劳动外，自己地坏误工多，又没种地资料，困难问题没有得到及时解决。干部与积极分子不愿纠偏，他们有这几种思想：（一）怕降低威信。民政主任说：“前年斗了人家，今年又要照顾，屙下来又吃了，真要丑死人哩。”（二）怕退果实。（三）怕报复。陈二则说：“咱村斗争对象都没低头，倒又照顾哩，打死我也不承认。”有的说：“过去区干部叫咱斗，现在又说斗错啦。”根据这思想，四月二十八日，召集干部群众一百六十多人会议，详细解释政策，又召开支部会，说明共产党员应知错改错，大胆的向群众检讨，才能提高我们的威信。经在饭市上地里四天酝酿，大家认识应该纠正。贫农陈二则说：“过去是自己拿上镢头掘自己岸，一家害了一家。”各组酝酿成熟后开大会，大家一致咯吵，错斗中农王增奇等十六户。贫农王小鸡等五户应补偿。过去笼统都是叫斗争对象，给他们的政治压力很厉害，这次在群众大会上，双方交谈心事话，去掉斗争对象称号，当晚群众允许他们参加大会，恢复政治权利。又讨论目下五户没吃，去年整财中有八万五千元，暂给他解决困难，给地主富农也支工资、借种子，按具体情况解决十二户困难。现在地大部下种，并计划让他们参加运输及打铁等副业生产。错斗中农孟胖则说：“没有梦见还有这一天哩，可好好生产吧。”经这样纠正偏向后，全村秋地三千六百多亩，现在下种二千九百多亩。群众一致计划赶阴历四月初一日全部争取下种。现有些牲口正酝酿到阳城、运城运输，生产情绪高涨。
