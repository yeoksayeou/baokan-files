　　【Taiyue News】After Qingshui Chengguan returned the wrongly struggled industrial and commercial properties, the merchants were able to develop freely. Last winter, during the "small turn-over" (小翻身 - a rectification or change in direction), the entire goods and properties of five commercial firms, three mills, and the goods of twelve merchants were confiscated. This time, except for two whose houses have not been repaired and returned temporarily, the rest have been fully returned to their original owners, or their losses have been compensated, and they have all resumed business. Since the proposal to correct leftist deviations, the leadership, starting from May 3rd, has separately convened meetings with households that were struggled against, general merchants, and households that received items, repeatedly discussing the matter. County and district cadres also made on-the-spot self-criticisms, pointing out the reasons for the chaos that occurred last winter. The main reason was that the county and district leadership was unclear about the policies and should not have used rural methods to classify the merchants into landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, etc. The leadership should be responsible for this error. This inspired everyone to discuss the policies and examine their own mistakes. Tan Jucai said, "If it is not corrected in another three months, I think everyone will be poor. Those classified as targets for struggle are poor, those classified as middle peasants are eaten poor, and we (referring to those classified as poor and hired) are all exhausted." The leadership immediately announced on May 16th, according to everyone's opinion, that all wrongly struggled items would be returned, and the poor and hired peasant groups among the merchants were abolished, and a chamber of commerce was established instead. Since the return, the infringed merchants have resumed business. Small merchants who did not have houses in the past are also looking for houses everywhere to prepare for a big undertaking. Li Daxiang, who used to run a restaurant, has also switched to selling Beijing-Guangdong groceries. He is busy repairing the storefront and decorating the shelves with colorful goods. There are three houses being rushed to be repaired on the street, and six small shops are being newly built outside the east gate. The goods on each shelf are also increasing day by day. According to statistics, the number of merchants, vendors, and workshops in the whole city has increased from 160 to 178.

　　取消商民中贫雇组退还错斗的工商业
  　沁水工商业开始繁荣起来
    【太岳消息】沁水城关退还了错斗工商业以后，商人们都放手发展。去年冬天因“小翻身”时，没收了五家商号的全部货物房产，三家磨坊，十二家商人的货物，这次除两家因房子没补修好暂时没退还外，其余已全部退还原主，或是补偿了他们的损失，现已全部恢复了营业。自提出纠正左倾偏向以后，从五月三号起，领导上即分别召集被斗户、一般商户、得东西的户，再三开会讨论，县区干部并当场检讨错误，指出去冬造成乱斗的原因，主要是县区领导上对政策不明确，不该用农村的办法把各商户划成地主、富农、中农等成份，这种错误领导上要负责任。这样启发了大家对政策的讨论与对自己错误的检讨，谭居菜说：“再过三个月不纠正，我看大家就都穷啦。划成对象的斗穷啦，划成中农的吃穷啦，咱（指划成贫雇的）都累穷啦。”领导上即按照大家意见，在五月十六号宣布了错斗的一律退还，并取消了商民中的雇贫组，另成立了商会。自退还以后，被侵犯的商户都恢复了营业，过去没房子的小商人，也到处找房准备大干，原来开饭铺的李大香，也改卖京广杂货，他忙着修理门面，把货架装制得花绿绿的。街上有三家正在赶修房子，东外门动工新修的有六座小铺，各家货架上东西也一天比一天多起来。全城统计商户摊贩作坊，已由一百六十家增加到一百七十八家了。
