　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 14th: The Liberation Army captured four county towns in the Western Henan Campaign, annihilating nearly 10,000 enemy troops. The Central Plains Front Headquarters issued a preliminary report on the battle results, stating:
　　This offensive began on the 1st of this month and concluded on the morning of the 10th with the capture of Deng County, marking the end of the first stage. Within ten days, the Liberation Army captured four county towns, including Neixiang, Xichuan, Zhenping, and Deng County, as well as seven important towns and villages, including Xixiakou, Xipingzhen, Jingziguan, Yuwangdian, Liguanqiao, Houyangzhen, and Chongyangdian, liberating over 50,000 square *li* of territory. It annihilated the entire 226th Regiment of the 76th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 9th Reorganized Division, along with four security regiments, and the majority of thirteen other security regiments, totaling 9,922 enemy soldiers. This included the capture of 7,522 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including Du Shouyue, the commander of the 226th Regiment, and Wang Haichen, the magistrate of Deng County, and the killing or wounding of over 2,400 enemy soldiers, including Lin Ningche, the deputy commander of the 226th Regiment. The army seized 41 artillery pieces, 4 flamethrowers, 3 grenade launchers, 156 light and heavy machine guns, 83 Thompson submachine guns, 4,979 rifles and carbines, 4,000 artillery shells, 360,000 rounds of ammunition, 130,000 hand grenades, 6 radio stations, 320,000 *jin* of grain, 2 vehicles, and a large quantity of other military supplies. With this victory, the Henan local bandits, repeatedly praised by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda organs and bowed to by Bai Chongxi at the puppet National Assembly, have suffered a fatal blow. Their old nest of Xixiakou and Neixiang has been captured. The Liberation Army is now continuing to expand the offensive, clearing out the remaining bandits. The complete elimination of the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the Hubei-Henan border area is not far off.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 14th: The Liberation Army recaptured Suiping County on the evening of the 11th, and the defending bandits fled.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 14th: Battle achievements of the local armed forces in the Jianghan Military Region: (1) The local armed forces between Tianmen and Hanchuan have been continuously clearing out local Chiang Kai-shek bandits, annihilating parts of the Hanchuan Police Company and the Yuekou Police Company, as well as six township governments, including Xincheng, killing or wounding more than 50 bandits and capturing over 130. (2) The local armed forces active between the Yangtze and Han Rivers fought seven battles from April 20th to May 5th, repelling four attacks by the 99th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's 33rd Brigade and the 1st Brigade of the Hubei Security Forces, completely annihilating three township security offices of local Chiang Kai-shek bandits, totaling over 120 enemy soldiers annihilated. (3) The local armed forces of Sui County routed over 200 Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were harassing the area south of the Xi River on the 6th, killing or wounding 35 of them.
　　These battles resulted in the annihilation of 335 enemy soldiers, the seizure of 19 light machine guns, 1 grenade launcher, 320 rifles and carbines, 1 vehicle, and a quantity of military supplies.
　　Furthermore, one squad of the 490th Regiment of the 164th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek bandits stationed at Fengkou in Mianyang County recently defected to our side with 1 light machine gun and 8 rifles and has now safely arrived in the liberated area, where they are warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Suyuwan Front, 14th: The Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from the cities of Xuchang and Changge on the 9th.
