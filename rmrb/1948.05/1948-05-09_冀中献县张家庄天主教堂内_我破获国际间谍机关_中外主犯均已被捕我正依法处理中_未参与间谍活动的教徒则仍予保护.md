Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 7th: Our Hebei Central Public Security Bureau uncovered a large-scale international espionage case on October 21st of last year inside the Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Church in Xian County. The masterminds, including Frenchman Shang Jianxun and Pan Rulin, were all arrested, and a large amount of evidence such as secret radio stations were seized. After more than four months of interrogation, the criminals confessed to colluding with the U.S.-Chiang espionage agencies and engaging in various espionage activities to sabotage the liberated areas. Our democratic government is now handling the matter according to law. As for Chinese and foreign priests, monks, and religious believers who did not participate in espionage activities, the government will continue to protect them in accordance with the law.

The Catholic Church has always been the general church of one of the larger dioceses in North China. Shang Jianxun was the deputy bishop and president of the Society of Jesus. Since January of the year before last, Shang Jianxun colluded with priests Pan Rulin, She Yuren, Li Shitang (Belgian), Mu Qihua (French), Jia Shushan (from Renqiu), and others, with U.S. imperialist spies in China and Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agencies, to begin espionage activities. The main facts are as follows:

(1) Establishing secret radio stations, using preaching as a cover, to scout for secret information about military affairs, such as the designations, organization, and stationing of the People's Liberation Army, its movements, expansion, names of leaders, wartime mobilization, and the stationing of various agencies and important factories. In addition to using secret radio stations to communicate directly with Tianjin, they also sent special personnel for secret communication. Shang Jianxun and others established contact with Mao De (American), an intelligence officer stationed in Nanjing by the United States, and reported to him various classified information about the liberated areas that they had collected. At the same time, they also transferred various information to the Chiang Kai-shek secret service agency in North China through Lei Minggeng (also known as Er Lei, Belgian), who had "preached" in the Anguo area. In August of the year before last, Lei wrote a letter to She Yuren, praising She's intelligence, saying: "Dear Father She, I received your little gift (editor's note: referring to the information provided by She) a few weeks ago. I showed it to many friends. A few American friends said: very good. I showed it to a few influential people, one of whom is a private friend of the old man who dominates China's destiny. Everyone is interested..."

(2) Enticing Chiang Kai-shek's troops to invade the liberated areas. On January 4th of the year before last, Shang and others sent Liao Ya'er secretly to Peiping (Beijing), using the name of his bishop Zhao Zhensheng (now in Tianjin) to request Sun Lianzhong, commander of the 11th War Zone of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, to send troops to invade the Hebei Central Liberated Area. Sun Lianzhong replied on the 14th, saying: "Troops have been dispatched to suppress them." They did everything possible to sabotage the people's participation in the army and support for the front, such as inciting new soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to desert, prohibiting religious believers from carrying stretchers, and organizing young people to flee to the Chiang Kai-shek area. In Zhangjiazhuang village alone, more than 40 people were deceived by them and fled to Tianjin and other places, some of whom were forced to join the reactionary armed forces organized by Lei Minggeng, the "Catholic Anti-Communist Corps." At the same time, Shang and others used shameless means such as threats and inducements to order Zhang Zhenhai, a religious believer in Zhangjiazhuang village, to steal secret documents of our Jiahe local armed forces, and ordered religious believers in Xifuzhuang village to steal documents and records of our training class, and even suggested to Lei Minggeng to urge Chiang Kai-shek's and U.S. planes to fly over the liberated areas to harass them. In addition, when the People's Liberation Army took the initiative to withdraw from Yan'an last year, they held a grand mass on March 25 to pray for the "victory" of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. As for the destructive activities such as creating rumors and slanders, there are too many to list.

Our Hebei Central Public Security Bureau had long been aware of Shang Jianxun's and others' espionage activities. The evidence was clear. On October 21st of last year, they went to Shang Jianxun's and others' espionage organization in the Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Church to conduct an inspection. A Hartler radio transmitter and a short-wave receiver, U.S.-made wireless electrical components and batteries, a copy of Sun Lianzhong's reply to the church's bishop Zhao Zhensheng's Xiang Zhi Zi San Er Er Hao Zi Han telegram, a letter from French priest Mei Huaiyi to Li Shitang for establishing radio contact between Shang and others with Peiping and Tianjin, a letter of commendation from Lei Minggeng to She Yuren, a notice signed by Shang on July 12th last year prohibiting religious believers from participating in land reform, and many other important espionage evidences were seized on the spot. At the same time, the main criminals Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Li Shitang, Mu Qihua, Jia Shushan, and others were arrested together. She Yuren is on the run. After more than four months of repeated interrogation, the criminals confessed to various espionage activities because of the conclusive evidence. Our democratic government believes that religious freedom in the liberated areas is complete. Regardless of the nationality of any religion, clergy, or religious believers, as long as they abide by the policies and laws of the democratic government and do not directly or indirectly participate in the war of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek people and other behaviors that sabotage the liberated areas, the government will resolutely protect them. This is the established policy of the democratic government. However, if anyone uses religion as a cover, colludes with U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang, engages in espionage activities, sabotages the policies and laws of the democratic government, and opposes the people, the government will severely punish them according to law. Therefore, the government has decided to deal with the crimes of Shang Jianxun and other criminals separately, according to the severity of their crimes, and a trial will be held soon.

### 冀中献县张家庄天主教堂内　我破获国际间谍机关  中外主犯均已被捕我正依法处理中  未参与间谍活动的教徒则仍予保护

　　冀中献县张家庄天主教堂内
  　我破获国际间谍机关
    中外主犯均已被捕我正依法处理中
    未参与间谍活动的教徒则仍予保护
    【新华社晋察冀七日电】我冀中公安机关于去年十月二十一日，在献县张家庄天主教堂内，破获一大规模国际间谍案，主犯法国人尚建勋、潘汝霖等全部被捕，并搜出秘密电台等大批证据，经四个多月侦讯，各犯对勾结美蒋间谍机关、从事破坏解放区的种种间谍活动，均已直认不讳。现我民主政府正依法处理中。至于未参与间谍活动之中外神甫、修士、教徒，政府仍一律依法予以保护。
    该天主教堂向为天主教在华北较大教区之一的总堂，尚建勋为该堂副主教兼耶稣会会长，自前年一月起，尚建勋即与神甫潘汝霖、佘裕仁、李诗堂（比籍）、穆启华（法籍）、贾书善（任邱人）等，勾结美帝国主义在华间谍，及蒋匪特务机关，开始间谍活动，其主要事实有：
    （一）建立秘密电台，利用传教为名，到处侦探有关军事等秘密情况，如解放军的番号、编制、驻地、动向、扩军情形、首长姓名、战时动员，及各种机关与重要工厂的驻地等等。除用秘密电台和天津直接联络外，还派遣专人秘密通信。尚建勋等曾与美国驻南京情报人员毛德（美籍）建立联系，向其报告所搜集的有关解放区的各种机密情报，同时他们还通过曾在安国一带“传教”的雷鸣庚（即二雷、比籍），将各种情报转给蒋匪在华北特务机关。前年八月，雷写信给佘裕仁，赞扬佘的情报称：“亲爱的佘神甫，我收到你的小小的礼物（编者：指佘供给的情报），已经几周，我给了许多朋友看，有几个美国朋友他们说：非常好。我给了几个有势力的人看，其中一人，是主宰中国之命运的老头的私友，大家都感兴趣……”
    （二）勾引蒋匪进犯解放区。前年一月四日，尚犯等派遣廖迓迩秘密赴平，用其主教赵振声（现在天津）名义，要求蒋匪十一战区司令长官孙连仲派兵进犯冀中解放区。孙连仲于十四日复文说：“已酌派部队前往进剿”。对解放区人民参军支前行动，他们更百般破坏，如鼓动解放军新战士逃亡，禁止教民抬担架，组织青壮年逃亡蒋区，仅张家庄一村，受他们欺骗逃往天津等地者，即达四十余人，其中一部分并被迫参加雷鸣庚所组织的反动武装，——“公教反共团”。同时尚犯等以威胁利诱等无耻手段，令张家庄教民张振海偷窃我交河地方武装的秘密文件，令西阜庄教民偷窃我训练班的文件纪录，甚至向雷鸣庚建议，促使蒋美飞机飞临解放区上空骚扰。此外，当去年解放军主动撤离延安时，他们即在三月二十五日作了一台大弥撒，为蒋匪之“胜利”而祈祷。至于造谣诬蔑等破坏活动，更不胜枚举。
    尚建勋等种种间谍活动，我冀中公安机关侦悉已久，罪迹显然，乃于去年十月二十一日前往张家庄天主教堂尚犯等的间谍机关内进行检查，当场搜出哈特莱氏发报及短波收报机一部，美造无线电机件及电池多件，孙匪连仲复该堂主教赵振声的相智子三二二号子寒代电一份，法籍神甫梅怀义为建立尚等与平津等无线电联络致李诗堂的信一件，雷鸣庚致佘裕仁的嘉奖信一封，去年七月十二日尚犯签名发出禁止教民参加土地法改革的通知一份，以及其他重要间谍证据甚多。同时即将主犯尚建勋、潘汝霖、李诗堂、穆启华、贾书善等，一并逮捕。佘裕仁则在逃。经四个多月的反复侦讯，各犯因证据确凿，对各种间谍活动，均直认不讳。我民主政府认为在解放区内信教是完全自由的，不论任何宗教及教士教徒的国籍，只要遵守民主政府的政策法令，不直接或间接参与蒋美人民的战争和其他破坏解放区行为，政府是决予保护的。这是民主政府既定的政策。但如果有利用宗教掩护，勾结美帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮，从事间谍活动，破坏民主政府政策法令，反对人民者，政府决依法严惩。为此，对尚建勋等各犯，现政府决分别罪犯轻重，依法处理，不日将举行审判。
