Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th: Frontline reporters report on the crossing of the Jing River, stating: After a night of rapid march, on April 18th, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the Jing River. Across the river was the important stronghold of the Chiang bandits on the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway, @ County seat. The battle cry of "Cross the Jing River and seize @ County seat" inspired everyone, and the assault team for the crossing was quickly formed. Wang Fukai led more than seventy brave warriors who could swim, armed with machine guns and submachine guns, gathered in a jujube grove, waiting for the order to cross.

At 5:00 PM, intense artillery fire from mortars and heavy machine guns, like a sudden rainstorm, swept the enemy's碉堡 fortifications on the hills outside @ County seat, around Huoshizui. The crossing soldiers and medics rushed out of the jujube grove in groups, swiftly crossed a stretch of green open ground, and plunged into the rushing water. Ignoring the enemy's resistance from the opposite bank, they advanced rapidly in the chest-deep rapids. As soon as they reached the other side, they braved the enemy's fire and charged towards the enemy on the hillside. The enemy was so frightened that they fled in all directions, and the assault team quickly occupied all the enemy's fortifications around Huoshizui.

The follow-up troops victoriously crossed the Jing River at dusk. Before dark, they cleared out the enemy west of the city. At dawn the next day, the People's Liberation Army used the enemy's碉堡 fortifications west of the city as an advanced position to launch a general attack to seize the city walls.

　　抢渡泾河
    【新华社西北三十日电】前线记者报导抢渡泾河情况称：经过一夜的急行军，四月十八日午解放军某部赶到了泾河边上，隔岸就是西兰公路上蒋匪重要据点＠县城。“抢渡泾河夺取＠县城”的战斗口号鼓舞着大家，抢渡的突击队很快的就组成了。王夫凯领着七十多个会游水的勇士，带着机枪和冲锋枪，集结在一片枣树林里，等待着抢渡命令。
    下午五时，迫击炮重机枪的激烈炮火，象一阵骤风暴雨，卷扫＠县城外山坡上火石嘴一带敌人的碉堡工事，抢渡的战士们和救护员一组一组迅速的冲出了枣树林，跃过一片碧绿的开阔地，投入喘急的水流里，不顾对岸敌人的阻击，在深达胸部的急流里迅速前进。他们一到对岸，即冒着敌人的火网，向着山坡上的敌人冲去。敌人吓得四下逃窜，突击队迅速占领了火石嘴一带敌人的全部工事。
    后续部队在黄昏时全部胜利的渡过了泾河，天未黑即扫清城西敌人，次日拂晓解放军利用了城西敌人的碉堡工事作为发动总攻夺取城垣的前进阵地。
