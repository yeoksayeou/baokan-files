(Taihang News) In order to implement the provision of the Land Law Outline on "resolutely protecting industry and commerce," the Yuanshi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to return the "Chunhetang" pharmacy, which was wrongly confiscated last year, to its original owner. It was also decided that the industrial and commercial properties of landlords and rich peasants who were wrongly struggled against in the past should also be returned. This pharmacy is quite large, with two counters in Yuanshi (north and south) and branches in Zanhuang City and Nanzuo Town. After our army liberated Yuanshi County on December 3rd last year, the north and south counters of "Chunhetang" pharmacy were confiscated on the 16th. At that time, it was thought that the "Chunhetang" pharmacy in Nanzuo Town and Zanhuang had already been confiscated, and some people said the pharmacy was close to the enemy, so it was confiscated. A total of more than 16,000 catties of medicines, worth more than 10 million yuan, and 60 shi of grain were confiscated. Liu Zhongzhen, the manager of "Chunhetang," and others were detained by the Public Security Bureau. After the confiscation, the government sent personnel to take over. The south counter was reorganized into Yuji Pharmacy, and the north counter was reorganized into the County Medical Clinic. Recently, according to the policy of protecting private capital and developing industry and commerce to promote market prosperity, the County Committee decided to release the detained manager Liu Zhongzhen and others, and return all the medicines, grains, and furniture to him. Liu Zhongzhen happily said, "The Communist Party and the democratic government are telling the truth. What they say they will do. I will definitely run the pharmacy well in the future." After all the items were returned on April 6th, Manager Liu summoned several shop assistants on the 7th to open the pharmacy and start business. He also plans to expand to Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang and other places to purchase medicines. Due to the impact of the return of "Chunhetang," six or seven shops in Yuanshi City that were actually closed have now reopened. For example, "Zhengzhonghao" grocery stall, because of fear, only put up a small stall in front of the door in the past, but now it has cleaned the facade and displayed the goods. There are also several firms that only put up a little goods to support the facade in the past, but now they have put out the buried goods, making the market gradually active and prosperous. In addition, the County Committee also stopped the confiscation of the "Huiyuanchang Sauce Shop" in the East Street of the city by Lirenzhuang (which was opened by a landlord in Lirenzhuang), and instructed that all the items taken away should be returned.

### 元氏坚决执行工商业政策　春和堂退还原主

　　元氏坚决执行工商业政策
  　春和堂退还原主
    【太行消息】中共元氏县委会，为执行土地法大纲中“坚决保护工商业”的规定，特决定将去年错没收了的“春和堂”药铺退还原主。并决定过去错斗的地主、富农工商业，亦要退还。该药铺规模甚大，除元氏有南北两柜外，赞皇城内及南佐镇皆有分铺。去年十二月三日我军解放元氏县城后，十六日即把“春和堂”药铺南北两柜同时没收了。当时认为过去已把在南佐镇和赞皇的“春和堂”药铺没收了，又听一些群众反映该药铺与敌接近，因而将其没收，共计药品一万六千余斤，约值一千万余元，还有粮食六十石。“春和堂”经理刘忠珍等扣押公安局。没收后，政府派员接收，当将南柜组成裕记药房，北柜组成县立医务所。最近县委会根据保护私人资本及发展工商业繁荣市场的政策，决定把扣着的经理刘忠珍等放回，将全部药品、粮食、家具退还他。刘忠珍很高兴的说：“共产党与民主政府就是讲真理，说出来就要做出来，我今后一定要把药房办好。”四月六日全部归还后，刘经理在七日就召来几个店员开了药房门，开始营业。并计划还要扩大，到邯郸、邢台、石家庄等地，购买药品。由于退还“春和堂”的影响，元氏城实际上已关门的六、七个商店，现在已都开门营业。如“正中号”杂货摊，因害怕，过去只在门前摆一个小摊，现在也把门面打扫干净，货物都摆起来。还有几个商号，过去每逢赶集，只摆一点货物支应门面，现在已把埋藏着的货物摆出来，使市场逐渐活跃繁荣起来。此外，县委并制止了里仁庄没收城内东街的“会源昌酱铺”（是里仁庄一地主开设的），并指示已拿走的要全部退回。
