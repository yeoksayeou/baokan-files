　　Returning Custodial Businesses and Lifting Trade Restrictions
　　Handan Sees Increase in Businesses, Workers Find Employment
　　[Handan News] After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, the city actively promoted the Party's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce through various means. The Municipal Government returned more than forty factories and stores of fugitive households that had been under custodial management, returning twenty-six of them. These are all relatively large businesses in Handan, such as the Shengji Iron Factory, with capital exceeding ten million yuan. The remaining ones are those whose original owners cannot be found temporarily; they will be returned immediately upon their return. The Chengguan, Railway Station, and other districts are also checking and returning industrial and commercial enterprises that were wrongly classified as landlord holdings. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce also inspected and corrected certain measures restricting market development, such as grain transaction stations and the ban on private cotton transactions, all of which were abolished to allow merchants to compete freely. Merchants expressed great satisfaction with these government measures, believing that industry and commerce will develop greatly in the future, and are actively planning how to expand their operations. Recently, more than a thousand requests have been made to the Municipal Government for assistance in finding housing. According to preliminary statistics from the Commercial Federation in April, various industries have been increasing. For example, the workshop industry (including chalk, cotton weaving, and oil pressing) increased from 63 households in December of last year to 106 households in April of this year (chalk industry statistics are not complete). Ironware businesses increased from 54 to 60 households, inns from 69 to 78, traditional Chinese medicine shops from 33 to 44, and restaurants from 112 to 126. Merchants who had fled in the past due to a misunderstanding of the policies have also been returning one after another recently.
　　Zhao Jinrong, manager of Yuansheng Pharmacy, said when talking about his own thoughts: "I am a representative of the merchants. Although I said I was not afraid last year, I was actually afraid to operate boldly in my heart. Most of the business on the counter was left to the shop assistants, and I myself engaged in some street neighborhood civic association work. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law this year, the newspapers repeatedly instructed various places to correct the left-leaning errors of the past regarding industry and commerce, coupled with practical actions in this city, such as returning the custody of wrongly classified industrial and commercial enterprises, I truly believed in the government's policy of developing industry and commerce." He is now looking for storefronts on the street to expand his business. He said, "If I can't find one in a few days, I plan to build my own storefront." He also suggested that the government call for the organization of the construction of new streets.
　　Due to the development of business, workers in cart transport and porterage industries have found employment. According to the statistics of cart puller Yang Baoyin from April 17th to 27th, he earned a total of 16,000 yuan in eleven days, with the most earning 2,700 yuan in one day. Porter Hao Tingquan earned 17,500 yuan in ten days.
　　At the symposium held in the Municipal Government the day before yesterday, factory owners and store managers all talked about their past fears of expanding business. Representatives of various industry trade unions also reviewed that many of their past actions were not based on the development of industry and commerce. For example, the porter representative reviewed the past forced loading and unloading, and the cart puller representative reviewed the past shortcomings of not negotiating prices in advance and extorting people afterward, and are determined to correct them in the future. Everyone unanimously agreed that if everyone wants to have food to eat and prosper Handan City, we must work together and do everything possible to develop industry and commerce, especially to improve labor-management relations.

### 退还代管商号取消买卖限制　邯郸商号增多工人也有活干

　　退还代管商号取消买卖限制
  　邯郸商号增多工人也有活干
    【邯郸消息】土地法大纲公布后，本市即经过各种方式宣传我党保护与发展工商业政策。市政府并将过去代管的四十多家逃亡户的工厂商店，退还了二十六户。这些都是邯市比较大的买卖，如盛记铁工厂，资金一千余万元。剩下的都是现在一时找不着原主的，待其回来，立即退还。城关车站等区也正在将错斗的工商业检查退回。工商局并检查改正了限制市场发展的某些措施，如粮食成交站，棉花禁止私人成交等，都一律取消，让商人自由竞争。商人对于政府的这些措施，表示十分满意，相信今后工商业将有大发展，都在积极筹划如何扩大经营。最近到市府请求帮助找房子的在一千间以上。根据商联会四月份几个行业初步统计，工商各业均在增加。如作坊业（包括粉笔、棉织、榨油），从去年十二月份到今年四月份由六十三户增至一百零六户（粉笔业未统计完全）。铁货业由五十四户增至六十户，客栈由六十九户增至七十八户，中药铺由三十三户增至四十四户，饭馆由一百一十二户增至一百二十六户，过去因不了解政策而逃亡的商人，最近也陆续归来。
    元生药行经理赵金容在谈他自己的思想时说：“我是商人代表，去年虽然口里也说不怕，但心里实在是不敢大胆经营。柜上的事大部分让店员们去搞，自己去搞些街里市民会的工作。今年土地法大纲公布后，报纸上一次又一次的指示各地纠正过去对工商业的左倾错误，加上本市又有实际行动，如退回代管和错斗的工商业，这我才真正相信了政府发展工商业的政策。”他现在到处在大街上找门面扩大生意。他说：“如果再过几天找不到，我就打算自己盖门面。”他并提议让政府号召组织建筑新的街道。
    由于买卖发展，排车脚行等工人均有活干了。据排车工人杨宝印四月十七到二十七日的统计，十一天共挣工资一万六千元，最多的一天挣到二千七百元。脚行工人郝庭泉十天挣洋一万七千五百元。
    前天在市府召开的座谈会上，厂主和商店的经理，都谈了过去不敢大干的心思，各行业工会代表也检查了过去他们好些事情不是从发展工商业出发的。如脚行代表检讨了过去的强装、强卸，排车代表检讨了过去事先不讲价，事后卡人等缺点，今后决心改正。大家一致意见，今后要想大家都有饭吃，繁荣邯郸市，只有共同努力，想尽一切办法去发展工商业，特别是劳资关系要搞好。
