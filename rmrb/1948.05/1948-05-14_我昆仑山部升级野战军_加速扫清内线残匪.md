    My Kunlun Mountain Unit Upgraded to Field Army, Accelerating the Clearing of Remaining Bandits in the Interior

    [This newspaper's message] Just as the whole country is celebrating the victorious offensive of our armies on all fronts, the Kunlun Mountain Unit of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army was honorably upgraded to a field army and held its founding meeting on May 1st at its forward deployment location.

    Vice Commander Wang of the Ji'nan Military Region, Vice Director Gao of the Administrative Office, Commissioner Sun of the Third Special District, and others, representing the Party, government, military, and people of Ji'nan, extended their congratulations to the entire army. First, Vice Commander Wang and Vice Director Gao, with full enthusiasm, explained to the entire army the glorious task of being upgraded to a field army, encouraging the entire army to work harder to clear the remaining Kuomintang bandit strongholds in northern Henan.

    Subsequently, Vice Commander Shi called on the entire army to rectify ideological positions, launch a large-scale military training campaign, improve military tactics and technology, and swiftly and thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits in the interior, so as to coordinate with the expeditionary corps to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and his bandit group and liberate all of China at an early date.

    Finally, combat hero Comrade Ma Fengming delivered a speech, saying forcefully: We must carry forward our past excellent fighting style, first annihilate all the remaining bandits in northern Henan, so that our parents, brothers, and sisters in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu can live a happy life.

    As soon as Comrade Ma Fengming finished speaking, the entire army shouted in unison: We pledge to learn from all fraternal corps, advance side by side! With a fighting posture, take practical action, launch a large-scale military training movement, improve tactical literacy, improve military skills, and thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang bandits in the interior, in response to the call of the Party and higher authorities. At the same time, we will repay the people of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and the people of the whole country with even greater victories. (Zhu Bing)
