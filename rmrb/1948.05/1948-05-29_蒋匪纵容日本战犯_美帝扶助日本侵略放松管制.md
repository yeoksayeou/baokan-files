　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Important Japanese war criminals who directly slaughtered Chinese soldiers and civilians and plotted various schemes of aggression on the Chinese battlefield are currently living freely in Japan. According to a Central News Agency report on the 15th, Tong Weigang, head of the China Section of the Allied Headquarters Legal Bureau, stated that in the past two and a half years, less than fifteen Japanese war criminals have been extradited to China. For example, the Japanese intelligence chief Kagesa Teishō, who directed Wang Jingwei's defection from Chongqing to establish a puppet regime, was able to avoid extradition by feigning illness. In addition, the recently deceased Japanese militarist Mitsumasa Yonai wrote to Chiang Kai-shek, requesting that the death sentence of Rear Admiral Fukuda Ryozō, former commander of the Japanese Navy's China Fleet, be commuted. Moreover, when Mei Ru’ao, the judge dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek clique to Tokyo to attend the Far East International Military Tribunal earlier this month, declared that the verdicts for Tōjō and the other twenty-five principal war criminals would have to wait three months before being announced, he said: "In view of the rapid changes in the world situation, the Tokyo trial has lost most of its political significance." This completely exposes the true, despicable intention of the collusion between the U.S. and Chiang to condone Japanese war criminals.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Tianjin News: Local press sources with access to information from Tokyo have learned that MacArthur's headquarters plans to gradually abandon the system of issuing directives, so as to gradually restore the freedom of the reactionary Japanese government in its administrative aspects. This illustrates the blatant destruction of the Potsdam Agreement by U.S. imperialism and its further support for reactionary forces in Japan. As early as January 18th of this year, MacArthur, in a letter to the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, requested that "the Japanese be allowed to regain substantial freedom of action in solving their own domestic problems and defending their own welfare." The Japanese Diet's committee investigating the illegal disposal of government property was ordered to conclude its work on the 20th of last month, effectively letting off the hook prominent figures in Japanese political and financial circles who had concealed huge amounts of supplies and profited from selling them on the black market. The censorship of Japanese newspapers was also declared abolished at the end of last month. The Central Purge Committee also ended on the 10th of this month, transferring the work of scrutinizing civil servants to the Cabinet Secretariat's official residence. The New York office of the MacArthur Headquarters Trade Group is also preparing to close on June 20th, allowing American and Japanese merchants to negotiate directly. These signs indicate that the U.S. imperialism has now completed some preparations, so that some aspects of Japanese politics and economy are no longer subject to control.

　　蒋匪纵容日本战犯
  　美帝扶助日本侵略放松管制
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】在中国战场直接屠杀中国军民和策划各种侵略阴谋之重要日本战犯，现仍在日本本国逍遥自在。据中央社记者十五日报导：盟总法制局中国课课长童维纲的谈话中称：过去两年半，引渡往中国的日本战犯尚不足十五名，如导演汪精卫出走重庆成立傀儡政权之日本特务头子影佐祯昭，竟可装病而免于引渡。此外，新近死去的日军阀米内光政曾致信蒋匪介石，要求将前日本海军中国舰队司令福田良三灭刑，而在本月初蒋匪派往东京出席远东国际军事法庭之法官梅汝＠，当其宣称对东条等二十五名首要战犯之判决，尚须待三个月后方能宣布时，他说：鉴于世界情势之急剧变化，东京之审判已失去其政治上之大部意义，这完全暴露了美蒋勾结纵容日本战犯的真正的卑劣的意图。
    【新华社陕北廿四日电】天津讯：此间报界自东京消息灵通方面人士获悉，麦克阿瑟总部已计划逐渐放弃颁发指令之制度，使反动的日本政府逐步恢复其行政方面之自由。这说明了美帝露骨破坏波茨顿协议，进一步扶植日本反动势力。早在本年一月十八日，麦克阿瑟在其致送美国会众院拨款委员会之信件中，即要求“允许日人在解决其本身内政问题及保卫其本身福利方面，大体上可重获行动自由。”日议会调查非法处置政府财产之委员会，已奉命于上月二十日结束其工作，事实上已将隐匿巨额物资并在黑市抛售获利之日本政界和财界的显要分子放纵不问。对于日本报纸之检查制度，亦于上月底宣告取消。而中央整肃委员会亦于本月十日结束，将审查公务员之工作移交内阁书记长官宦房。麦克阿瑟总部贸易组纽约办事处，亦准备于六月二十日结束工作，使美日商人可以直接交涉。这些迹象，说明目前美帝已完成若干准备，借使日本政治经济之若干方面不再受管制。
