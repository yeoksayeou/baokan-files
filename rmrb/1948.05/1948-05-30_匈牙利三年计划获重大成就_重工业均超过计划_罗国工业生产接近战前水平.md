Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 27th: TASS, Budapest: Hungary's Three-Year Plan has achieved significant success in the nine months since its implementation. According to an article by Mr. Bellis, Secretary-General of the State Planning Bureau, investments in the national economy have been increasing monthly, with a total of 1.4 billion forints (Hungarian currency). Many new state enterprises originally planned have been established, and labor productivity has also greatly increased. In the first six months, the coal mining industry exceeded its current plan by 7%, the metallurgical industry by 2%, the machine manufacturing industry by 11%, and the chemical industry by 16%. In March, important products such as coal, pig iron, steel, and rolled steel all greatly exceeded their plans. The coal mining, metallurgy, and engineering industries have exceeded pre-war levels, and many other industries are approaching pre-war levels. In agriculture, as of April 20th this year, the sown area has exceeded that of the same period last year by 1.07 million Hungarian acres. To help farmers with spring plowing, the government has issued agricultural loans of 58 million forints this spring. In terms of transportation, railway freight volume has now reached 93% of the pre-war level. In the first seven months of the Three-Year Plan, the total freight volume reached 11 million tons, an increase of 4 million tons compared to the previous year. According to Finance Minister Nyaradi, the increasing labor productivity in the industrial sector has promoted increasing exports. Hungary is now trading with 54 countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 27th: Combined reports from TASS, Bucharest, and Moscow: Most industrial sectors in Romania had greatly exceeded pre-war levels by March of this year, with particularly good results in the steel, pig iron, tractor, locomotive, textile, and leather industries. Romania's overall industrial production is now approaching pre-war levels, but at the end of the war, it had fallen to only 50% of pre-war levels. Romania's spring plowing has also been successfully completed, with this year's cultivated area reaching 6.5 million hectares, far larger than in previous years. The development of industry and agriculture, the expansion of international trade, and the establishment of domestic trade controls have enabled Romania, after the currency reform, to continue systematically reducing prices. In the first few months of this year, prices have generally decreased.

    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利三年计划实施以来九个月中，已获重大成就。据国家计划局秘书长贝利斯日前撰文指出：对国民经济的投资月月增加，总数已达十四亿福里特（匈币）。计划原定建立的许多新国家企业，都已开办，劳动生产率亦大为提高。头六个月煤矿业即超过目前百分之七，冶金工业百分之二，机器制造业百分之十一，化学工业百分之十六，三月份的煤、铣铁、钢、卷钢等重要产品，都大大超过计划。煤矿、冶金与工程业已超过战前水平，其他许多工业已接近战前水平。农业方面，截至今年四月二十日止，播种面积已超过去年同时一百零七万匈亩。政府为帮助农民春耕，今春已发放农贷五千八百万福里特。运输方面，铁道运载量现已达战前水平百分之九十三，实行三年计划的头七个月，总运载量已达一千一百万吨，较前一年增加四百万吨。另据财政部长尼亚拉弟称：由于工业方面日益增加的劳动生产率，促进了日益增多的出口。现在匈牙利已与五十四个国家进行贸易。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合塔斯社布加勒斯特及莫斯科讯：罗马尼亚大多数工业部门，到今年三月时即已大大超过战前水平，其中钢、铣铁、拖拉机、火车头、纺织品与皮革工业的成绩特别良好。罗马尼亚的整个工业生产，现已接近战前水平，但在战争结束时，则曾降低到只有战前的百分之五十。罗马尼亚春耕亦已胜利完成，今年的耕地面积已达六百五十万公顷，远较历年为大。工农业的发展，国际贸易的扩大，与国内贸易管制的建立，使货币改革后的罗马尼亚得以继续有系统的减低物价。今年头几个月，物价业已普遍减低。
