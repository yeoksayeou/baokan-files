Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 2nd. Our reporter reports: The Jin-Sui local armed forces have significantly improved. In the past three months, a certain unit has boldly and actively launched attacks in the area where Jin, Shaanxi, and Sui provinces meet, achieving great results and expanding the liberated areas, which is of great significance. The Chiang bandits entrenched in the area have been severely hit. The bandit and puppet Zhu Wumei's unit and parts of the Mongolian Security Division and Garrison Division have been annihilated, totaling more than 1,000 people, liberating more than 100,000 people in Fugu and Hefu (newly established county, located north of Fugu, formed by one district west of the Yellow River in Hequ and part of Fugu) counties and the entire territory of Jungar Banner in the Yike Zhao League, especially liberating 40,000 Mongolian compatriots in Jungar Banner from the brutal rule of the Chiang Party's Han chauvinism. The contradictions and conflicts between the Mongolian and Han nationalities and between the Mongolian Wangye mansions and banners created by the Chiang-Fu bandit gang to maintain their bloody rule will disappear in the future. Under the correct policy of the Chinese Communist Party towards ethnic minorities, they will live a life of mutual respect, unity, mutual freedom, democracy and equality.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengtai Front, 1st. Recently, the Yan bandit Xishan has gathered the 49th Division, the 71st Division, and the 8th Column in the Shouyang area, appearing to be harassing the Zhengtai line. After our powerful Jin-Cha-Ji army group severely attacked the Yan bandits in the Zhengtai Campaign last spring, the remnants of the Yan bandits were forced to shrink back to Taiyuan, trapped in an isolated city. If the Yan bandits bravely dare to come out to harass, our liberated area's army and people will surely give them a head-on blow.

　　晋绥地武某部作战三月
  　共歼灭匪伪军千余解放蒙古同胞四万
    【新华社晋绥二日电】本社记者报导：晋绥地方武装力量显著提高，某部近三个月来在晋陕绥三省交界地区大胆主动出击，获得巨大战绩，扩大了解放区，意义极大。盘踞该地之蒋匪已受到沉重打击，匪伪朱五美部及蒙古保安师、警备师各被歼一部共千余人，使府谷、河府（新设县，在府谷北由原河曲黄河西一个区及府谷一部划成）两县及伊克昭盟之准格尔旗全境十余万人民获得解放，特别是将准格尔旗之四万蒙古同胞从蒋党大汉族主义的暴政下解放出来。过去蒋傅匪帮为维持其血腥统治所制造之蒙汉民族间与蒙族各王爷府旗间的矛盾和冲突，今后将消失，而在中共对少数民族的正确政策下，过着互相尊重团结互相自由民主平等的生活。
    【新华社正太前线一日电】阎匪锡山近日于寿阳地区集结四十九师、七十一师及第八纵队等部，有向正太沿线出扰摸样。自我晋察冀强大兵团于去年春季正太战役，予阎匪以沉重打击后，阎匪残部被迫龟缩太原，困守孤城。如果阎匪硬着头皮胆敢出扰，我解放区军民必将予以迎头痛击。
