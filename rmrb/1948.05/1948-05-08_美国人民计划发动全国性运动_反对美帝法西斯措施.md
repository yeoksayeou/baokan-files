Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: A comprehensive Washington dispatch: The American people are resolutely resisting the reactionary authorities' intensified fascist measures. The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a solemn statement on April 30, vehemently condemning the "Sabotage Control Act" proposed by the Un-American Activities Committee, pointing out: "Every progressive organization and political party will do its utmost to reject and oppose this fascist measure"; the statement called on the people of the whole country to rise up and "fight to defend democracy." Roach, chairman of the Wallace for President Committee in New York State, announced a few days ago that the committee had sent a telegram to all 45 members of the New York State legislature, asking them to oppose the reactionary bill proposed by the Un-American Activities Committee; and pointed out: "The forces supporting Wallace will never be intimidated by this proposal." Eight congressmen, including Isacson, Sabath, and Marcantonio, met in Washington on April 27, attended by representatives of many progressive groups. The meeting planned to launch a nationwide movement to oppose this anti-communist legislation. One of the initiators of the meeting, Democratic Congressman Kenlin, announced that the purpose of the meeting was to "awaken the American people to face the threat facing the country." Marcantonio, in his speech, called on "progressive forces must stop the Un-American Activities Committee's attempt to make fascism legal in the United States." Regardless of the threats and persecution of the reactionary authorities, the broad masses of the American people and progressives continue to uphold the Wallace movement and fight to defend democracy. Five thousand students in Iowa City and more than 600 citizens in Newark disregarded the obstruction of fascists and bravely participated in the Third Party's election conference at the end of last month. Moorehead, president of the National Committee of the American-Soviet Friendship Association, who was persecuted and sentenced to three months in prison and now released on bail, stated in a statement to the press on the 2nd that he would continue to "fight for world peace." He forcefully stated: "We will fight for freedom from the Un-American Committee and its Hitler-like shameless Un-American methods." At the same time, the Truman government's unrestrained and frenzied reactionary policies are increasingly being rejected by the American people. According to a TASS dispatch on the 24th of last month, citing a US opinion poll: "Tests on many issues show that Truman has greatly lost popular support in recent months, with only 36 percent now approving of Truman, compared with 55 percent last October. Even among Democratic voters, 37 percent oppose Truman."
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: A comprehensive Washington dispatch: The American reactionary authorities, frightened by the growing development of the people's democratic forces, are doing everything possible to carry out violent suppression. The notorious House Un-American Activities Committee submitted a proposal for a comprehensive anti-communist and anti-democratic so-called "Sabotage Control Act" on the 28th of last month, attempting to make the Communist Party of the United States and all democratic organizations illegal. At the same time, fierce persecution of democrats is emerging one after another. The Federal Court, under the pretext of "contempt of Congress," began trying ten artists, including Hollywood film scriptwriter Lawson, in the latter half of last month. Moorehead, president of the National Committee of the American-Soviet Friendship Association, and Breen and Diesman, staff members of the Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, were unreasonably sentenced to three months in prison. The American reactionary authorities are even carrying out all kinds of intimidation and sabotage activities against the Third Party movement and its supporters. Baldwin, campaign manager for Wallace's presidential candidacy, claimed at the end of April that police in Logan County, West Virginia, illegally confiscated Wallace's petition and went to the homes of signatories, threatening them to withdraw their names. Third Party campaign conferences in many places have been subjected to destruction and sabotage by fascist thugs.

　　美国人民计划发动全国性运动
  　反对美帝法西斯措施
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合华盛顿讯：美国人民坚决抗击反动当局变本加厉的法西斯措施。美共全国委员会四月三十日发表严正声明，对非美活动委员会所提“破坏行动控制法”力予痛斥；指出：“每一进步组织及政党均将竭力拒绝与反对这一法西斯措施”；声明号召全国人民奋起“为保卫民主政治而斗争。”纽约州华莱士竞选总统委员会主席罗治日前宣布：该委员会已致电纽约州所有四十五位议员，要求他们反对非美活动委员会所提的反动法案；并指出：“拥护华莱士的势力决不会被这一建议所吓倒。”伊萨克逊、沙巴兹、麦肯托尼奥等众议员八人，于四月二十七日在华盛顿集会，到有许多进步团体的代表，会议计划发动一全国性运动，以反对这一反共立法。会议发起人之一民主党众议员肯林宣布会议之目的在于“唤醒美国人民正视国家所面临的威胁。”麦肯托尼奥在发言中呼吁“进步势力必须阻止非美活动委员会使法西斯主义在美国成为合法的企图。”不顾反动当局的恫吓与迫害，美国广大人民及进步人士继续坚持拥护华莱士运动与为保卫民主而奋斗。衣阿华城的五千学生及纽亚克城的六百余公民蔑视法西斯分子的阻挠，于上月底英勇地参加第三党的竞选会议。受迫害而被判三月徒刑现交保释放的美苏友好协会全国委员会会长摩尔福，二日向报界发表之声明中，表示继续为“争取世界和平而斗争”。他力称：“我们将为自非美委员会及其希特勒式无耻非美方法中争取自由而斗争。”与此同时，杜鲁门政府肆行疯狂反动政策之结果，越益遭受美国人民之唾弃。据塔斯社上月二十四日引美民意测验称：“许多问题的测验显示：在最近几月内杜鲁门已大大丧失人民的支持，现在仅百分之三十六赞成杜鲁门，而去年十月则为百分之五十五。甚至在民主党选民中也有百分之三十七反对杜鲁门。”
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合华盛顿讯：美反动当局慑于人民民主势力的日益发展，正千方百计肆行暴力镇压。臭名昭著的众院非美活动委员会于上月二十八日提出一项全面反共反民主的所谓“破坏行为控制法”的建议案，妄图使美共及一切民主组织成为非法。同时，对民主人士的凶横迫害层出不穷。联邦法庭于上月下旬以“侮蔑国会罪”为借口，开始审讯好莱坞电影脚本著作家劳逊等十名艺术工作者。美苏友好协会全国委员会会长摩尔福、反法西斯难民委员会职员布利安与戴斯曼均被无理判处三月徒刑。美反动当局更对第三党运动及其拥护者进行百般威吓与破坏活动。最近西北大学拥护华莱士竞选的十二名教职员已被无理撤职，另十名教授亦受“自谋教职”的威胁。有八名科学家也被剥夺了职业。美反动当局并驱使法西斯流氓四出阻止与破坏第三党之竞选活动。据华莱士总统候选人竞选干事巴尔德温四月底宣称：西佛吉尼亚州洛根县警察非法没收拥护华莱士请求书，并跑到签名者的家中，威吓他们把名字取消。许多地方的第三党竞选会议，都遭受法西斯暴徒的破坏与捣乱。
