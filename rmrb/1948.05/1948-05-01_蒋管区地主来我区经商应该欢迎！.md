To the Editor:

　　I have a question that I can't figure out. Many comrades are discussing it, but we can't come to a conclusion. Some of our cadres have landlord family backgrounds, and their hometowns are still in Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. Their whole family has come to settle in the liberated areas. In order to maintain their livelihood, their family sells some property from their hometown to do business in the liberated areas. Does this count as dispersing property? What attitude should cadres take towards their families' actions? If they don't do this, they cannot survive in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas and their lives are in danger. How should this situation be resolved? (Shang Wen)

Comrade Shang Wen: In general, when landlords and rich peasants turn their property over to cooperatives, factories, or shops for business, it is a progressive phenomenon and should be resolutely protected as industry and commerce. Struggle against them is not allowed, and it cannot be considered dispersing property. This point is clearly stipulated in the Central Bureau's instructions on industrial and commercial policy and its instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee. The fact that they are selling their property from the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas to settle in the liberated areas and do business can increase the wealth of the liberated areas and is beneficial to the prosperity of the economy and the development of production. Not only does it not count as dispersing property, but we should also take various effective measures to help them solve their problems and establish shops and factories so that they can start their businesses as soon as possible.

　　蒋管区地主来我区经商应该欢迎！编辑同志：
    我有一个问题弄不清，不少同志在一块扯，也扯不出一个名堂。咱们有些干部，家庭是地主，目下家乡仍是蒋管区，全家跑来解放区安家，他们家庭为了维持生活，从家里变卖一些财产，来解放区做生意，这算不算分散财产？干部对家庭这样作法应持什么态度？他们如果不这样作，在蒋管区无法生存，且有性命危险，类此情况，应怎样解决，请答复。（尚文）
    尚文同志：一般地主富农把财产转向合作社、工厂或商店经商者，是进步现象，应该当做工商业坚决保护，不准斗争，不能认为是分散财产。这一点中央局关于工商业政策的提示及给太岳区党委的指示中，都有明确规定。象你们提的从蒋管区变卖了财产，来解放区安家做生意，可以增加解放区财富，对繁荣经济，发展生产都是有好处的，不但不算分散财产，还应该以各种有效措置帮助他们解决，建立商店、工厂，使困难他们早日开始营业。
