Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 11th: A unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army, on the 9th, annihilated over 2,000 bandits of Yan’s Provisional 49th Division’s direct units and most of its 1st Regiment, and part of its 3rd Regiment, in the area of Dongxiguo Village and Nanbeishangshe, between Shouyang and Mengxian, north of the Zhengtai Railway. Among those captured alive were Yan’s 34th Army Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander concurrently Provisional 49th Division Commander Zhang Yi, Provisional 49th Division Major General and Deputy Division Commander concurrently 1st Regiment Commander Zhao Junyi, etc. The remnants of the bandits collapsed and retreated northwest towards Shouyang. Our pursuing troops liberated Shouyang County and Zongai Town to the northwest on the 10th. Detailed battle results are currently being tallied.

(Our Newspaper's Report) More than 100 bandits of Yan’s 49th Division in Caogou, Shouyang, arrived at our Sansheng Village south of the road on April 15th to loot grain. The village’s militia had laid landmines in advance. After discovering the enemy, they immediately covered the safe evacuation of the entire village’s masses, and cooperated with a part of the rotational warfare team, using sniper fire to lure the enemy into the trap. As the enemy entered our ambush circle, the landmines went off, killing one enemy and wounding nine. Three were shot dead by rifles. The enemy fled in panic. We recovered five shi of grain, forty sheep, and more than one hundred pieces of clothing from the masses, creating a model of combining landmines with sniper fire.

More than 100 bandits of Yan’s from Li @ Village, Yuci, went to Duanting in the northern section of Shouyang Road to rob and plunder. The militia of Changling and Yunyan villages south of our road immediately supported and repelled the enemy, killing one enemy and wounding four, and recovering some grain and clothing.

Between the 15th and 18th, the bandits of Yan’s in Taigu used three regiments of troops to launch a joint attack on Guanzhai and Niangou in the hinterland of our Third District. Our militia had previously buried dozens of landmines in the ditches from Pangzhuang to Guanzhai, and a total of more than 20 were detonated, causing great casualties to the enemy.
