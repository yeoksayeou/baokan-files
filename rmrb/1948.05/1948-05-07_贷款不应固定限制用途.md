Loans Should Not Have Fixed Restrictions on Their Use
    This year, Baitacun in the Fourth District of Shahe was allocated 400,000 yuan in production loans by the county bank. When the production committee member Ji Quanfu and others announced the loan usage at a mass meeting, they said: "This loan is specifically for buying livestock and farm tools, and cannot be used for anything else." Poor peasant Ji Niu'de wanted to borrow 20,000 yuan to buy some cotton to spin and weave, and then keep 10,000 yuan to do a small business in the west to exchange for chaff to survive the famine. After hearing this, he didn't dare to say anything. Ji Jinxiu borrowed 30,000 yuan, but it wasn't enough to buy livestock with others; she kept it at home for more than ten days, but didn't dare to do a small business either, leaving her at a loss. In the future, when providing loans, it is best not to have such restrictions. As long as it's not for prostitution, gambling, or waste, but is used for production, the borrowers should be able to choose the usage themselves. (Zhang Chenghai)

　　贷款不应固定限制用途
    沙河四区白塔村今年由县银行给分配了四十万元生产贷款，生产委员纪全福等在群众大会发表贷款用途时说：“这款是叫买牲口农具，不叫作别的用。”贫雇纪牛德想贷二万元给家里买几斤棉花来纺织，再留一万元到西边做个小买卖，换些糠回来渡荒。听这一说就不敢吭了。纪金秀贷了三万元，想与别人伙买牲口不够；在家里放了十几天，想做个小买卖又不敢，弄的没办法。以后贷款，最好不要这样限制，只要不嫖不赌不浪费，而是用来生产，用途可由贷款群众自己选择。（张成海）
