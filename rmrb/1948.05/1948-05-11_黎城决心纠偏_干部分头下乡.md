Licheng Determined to Correct Deviations
Cadres Head to the Countryside in Separate Groups

[Report from this newspaper] The Licheng United Office's Spring Ploughing Circular on the 6th stated: Although the spring ploughing and sowing work in Licheng has made some achievements after several mobilizations, cadre assignments, and mutual aid reorganizations, the leadership has not paid enough attention to spring ploughing this year. Most village cadres are lying down on the job, and the problems of the middle peasants have not been resolved, so that spring ploughing production has not formed a movement. In Jinqu Village, Fourth District, sixty or seventy people are visiting temples and relics on the streets every day, and some are gambling and visiting prostitutes. In some villages, poor and hired peasants are applying more fertilizer to good land and not fertilizing poor land, planning to exchange for good land when redistributing fertilizer to make up for deficiencies, while middle peasants are applying more fertilizer to remote and poor land and not fertilizing good land, fearing it will be taken away, wasting the fertilizer. Middle peasants in Junkou Village, Fourth District, knowing that when making up for deficiencies, floating assets and livestock of middle peasants will not be touched, but thinking that land will be touched, are unwilling to cultivate deeply and carefully, selling their property, buying livestock, and engaging in sideline occupations every day, trying to get by grabbing anything available. In addition, district and county cadres emphasize making up for deficiencies, neglect production, and hold narrow-minded poor and hired peasant viewpoints, which seriously hinders spring ploughing production. In order to correct deviations and overcome obstacles in a timely manner and to make spring ploughing form a movement, the county committee held a county-wide production cadre expansion meeting on the 2nd of this month. After group discussions, it was discovered that the countryside was very chaotic. In Pingtou Village, Fourth District, Ma Lao Si, the head of the "Poor Peasant Group," purged all the middle peasants from the saltpeter workshop, saying this is called the poor and hired peasant line, and even sealed the door of the branch secretary, Yang Jin Yuan; the poor and hired peasants in Jinqu are not actively engaged in production, but are only brewing to take this family's land and that family's house. In Gaojiajiao, the poor and hired peasants only ask the middle peasants to perform duties when discussing dispatching labor. The truly honest poor and hired peasants asked to withdraw from the "Poor Peasant Group." When discussing mutual aid equivalent values in Jialing Village, the poor and hired peasants said, "Middle peasants have more livestock, and poor peasants have less livestock, so middle peasants should take care of the poor and hired peasants," reducing the livestock wage. The middle peasants responded, "Don't even mention earning an equivalent value; working for a day cannot even cover the livestock's feed." In Qiaogou Village, only the middle peasants are asked to make military shoes. The head of the "Poor Peasant Group" in Nansanglu dismissed the deputy director of the armed forces committee and suspended the party membership of the branch secretary, not allowing him to convene branch meetings, and saying, "We must overthrow this group of party members in our village." Tang Jinshui, the head of the "Poor Peasant Group" in Shangmajia Yu, priced five fruit weaving machines at 6,000 yuan each, and took two for himself first without paying. He also organized poor peasants to call the village chief and public security officer to the meeting place and make them go through scrutiny. They could not pass until they made a good self-criticism. The "Poor Peasant Group" in Sujiajun has already established a peasant representative meeting without approval from higher levels and is preparing to take over the land of the middle peasants (having already taken over two acres of land from one middle peasant) to make up for deficiencies. District cadres dare not boldly stop them, fearing they will be attacking the poor and hired peasants. The middle peasants respond: "We have made a bad plan. We shouldn't have been so careful and frugal before. If we had squandered it all, we would be better off now." The poor and hired peasants in Liudong even sealed the door of a poor peasant's house, preparing to confiscate it, saying that he was a special agent before and has not been cleared. The poor and hired peasants in Yuanquan, Fifth District, do not allow middle peasants to be mutual aid team leaders, but when they themselves are team leaders, they do not actively lead production. District cadres who come to the village know that what they are doing is wrong, but dare not correct it, fearing they will be violating the "poor and hired peasant line," and sit idly by as the chaos develops. Based on the above situation, and after further discussions at the conference, a strict criticism was made of one-sided poor and hired peasant viewpoints, tailism, and the lack of seriousness in implementing the Party's policies. It was decided that in the future, there must be planned and focused in-depth inspections and promotion. Liu Jiwei of the County Committee personally went to a village to create experience. The district, led by the district chief or the main cadres of the sub-committee, organized all the personnel participating in spring ploughing into spring ploughing work teams, and the joint defense formed spring ploughing work groups. In the village, based on the old cadres, honest poor and hired peasants and enthusiastic middle peasants were absorbed to jointly organize a spring ploughing committee to lead production. It is necessary to achieve vertical connection, sound leadership, close contact, and timely exchange of experience. Finally, the county committee decided to dissolve all "Poor Peasant Groups" organized in villages that were not making up for deficiencies, apologize and compensate for damages to the interests of the middle peasants, immediately stop control measures, immediately unseal property and doors, appropriately settle landlords and rich peasants, educate village cadres, do more things that are beneficial to the masses, and lead production well. After this, the cadres headed to the countryside in separate groups, determined to correct deviations and break through in spring ploughing.

    黎城决心纠偏
    干部分头下乡
    【本报消息】黎城联合办公室六日春耕通报称：黎城的春耕下种工作虽然经过几次动员及干部配备，互助整顿，做出一些成绩，但由于领导上今年对春耕重视不够，大部村干部躺倒不干，中农问题没解决，使春耕生产没有形成运动。四区靳曲村每天有六七十个人在街上访古，有些人在嫖赌。有些村庄贫雇农是往好地多上粪，孬地不上粪，计划抽肥补瘦时换好地，中农是把远地孬地多上粪，好地不上粪，怕被抽走，把粪白搭了。四区峻口村中农知道在填补时不动中农浮财牲口，以为要动土地，便不愿深耕细作，变卖家产，买上牲口，天天搞副业，抓现成。再加上区县干部重视填补、轻视生产与狭隘贫雇观点，就严重的阻碍了春耕生产。县委为及时纠正偏向，克服障碍，使春耕形成运动，特于本月二号召开全县生产扩干会议。经过小组讨论，发现农村十分混乱。四区平头村“贫农团”长马老四把硝坊的中农一律清洗出去，说这就叫贫雇路线，把支书杨进元的门也封了；靳曲贫雇不积极生产，光酝酿着抽这家地，那家房。高家脚贫雇讨论派差，光叫中农出差。真正老实贫雇要求退出“贫农团”。贾岭村贫雇讨论互助等价时说：“中农牲口多，贫农牲口少，中农要照顾贫雇。”把牲口工资降低。中农反映是：“不用说赚等价，做一天工连牲口吃也糊不住。”桥沟村派军鞋光叫中农做。南桑鲁“贫农团”长把武委会副主任撤职了，把支部书记的党籍也停了，不让他召开支部会，还说：咱村这伙党员非踢垮他不行。上马家峪“贫农团”长唐金水把五架果实织布机作了价，每架六千元，他自己先要了两架，没出钱。并组织贫农，把村长、公安员叫到会场，让他们过关。反省不好过不去关。苏家峻“贫农团”不通过上级，已成立起农代会，准备接收中农的土地（已接收了一家中农二亩地），进行抽补。区干部也不敢大胆阻止，怕打击了贫雇。中农反映是：咱打算坏啦，以前不该仔仔细细节省来，要是大腿蹬住二腿挑干时，现在可弄好啦。六洞贫雇竟把一家贫农的门查封了，准备没收，说他以前是个特务，直到现在还未开封。五区源泉贫雇不让中农当互助组长，但自己当了，又不积极领导生产。区干部到村，明知做得不对，不敢纠正，怕违反了“贫雇路线”，坐视混乱的发展。根据以上情况，又经过大会讨论，严格批判了片面的贫雇观点，尾巴主义，对党的政策执行的不严肃等错误，决定今后必须有计划、有重点的深入检查推动。县委刘己未亲自到一个村创造经验，区里由区长或分委主要干部为主，把所有参加春耕的人员组成春耕工作队，联防成立春耕工作组，村里以旧干部为基础，吸收老实贫雇农与热心生产的中农共同组织春耕委员会来领导生产。要做到上下贯通，领导健全，密切连系，及时交流经验。最后县委决定不进行抽补村所组织的“贫农团”一律解散，损害中农利益的道歉赔偿，立即停止管制，财产封门的一律立即启封，适当安置地主富农，教育村干，多给群众做有利的事情，好好领导生产。此后，各干部分头下乡。决心纠正偏向，突开春耕。
