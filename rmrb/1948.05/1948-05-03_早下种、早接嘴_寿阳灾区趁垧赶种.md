　　Sow Early, Graft Early
  　Shouyang Disaster Areas Seize the Time to Rush Planting
    [Taihang News] The masses in the first, second, and fourth districts of the Shouyang disaster area, after organizing for production and self-relief, are now launching a concentrated effort to sow seeds. After the rain in early April, the masses, under the slogan of "sow early, graft early," are rushing to plant early-maturing crops. According to incomplete statistics, villages have already sown more than 5,500 mu of miscellaneous grains such as peas, flax, and corn. The seven villages including Bishi and Yancun earned 38 dan of rice from transportation. After securing food, they shifted to rushing the sowing of seeds, and have now sown more than 1,000 mu. The masses in Lizhuang Village learned from last year's experience of rigidly adhering to the seasonal calendar for planting, which resulted in drought and crop failure, coupled with the impact of the war, which delayed planting, leading to frost damage before the crops matured, causing the disaster. This year, after the rain, they immediately held meetings to discuss early planting, and stipulated that shady areas and flatlands (where germination is slower due to the cold) should be planted first. At the same time, in case of participation in the war, they would divide into two shifts, one to stay at home to rush planting, and the other to participate in the war, combining war and production. After rectifying the problems of undemocratic mutual aid and unfair equivalent exchange in the mutual aid groups, all eighteen mutual aid groups in Liuzhuang Village mobilized to rush planting, planting 320 mu of corn and other crops in five days. Women and children also participated in the rush planting in Shiquan Village, and more than 500 mu have been sown. In order to ensure the successful completion of sowing, the county government instructed cadres in districts and villages to fully organize and lead the masses to sow during the sowing period. It also distributed 400 dan of relief grain and loans of 6.5 million yuan to solve the problems of livelihood and seeds for the masses during the sowing period. Recently, it purchased more than 79 dan of seeds from the hinterland and distributed them to various districts (this amount of seeds can sow 12,413 mu of land) to ensure that all the masses in the disaster area can complete sowing.

　　早下种、早接嘴
  　寿阳灾区趁垧赶种
    【太行消息】寿阳灾区一、二、四区群众，经过组织生产自救，现正突击下种。四月初落雨后，群众在“早下种、早接嘴”的口号下，纷纷抢垧种早熟庄稼。据不完全统计，各村已下种豌豆、胡麻、玉茭等杂粮五千五百余亩。碧石、沿村等七村运输赚到米卅八石。有了吃的以后，即转向突击下种，现已下种一千余亩。李庄村群众接受了去年死按节令种地，结果天旱没垧，又加上战争影响种的很迟，庄稼没熟就下了霜，造成灾荒。今年落雨后，即开会讨论早种问题，并规定要先种背阴，坪上地（因天冷发芽迟），同时如遇参战时要分开两班，一班在家抢种，一班参战，做到战争生产结合。刘庄村经过整顿互助组解决了互助不民主和等价不公的问题后，全村十八个互助组全体出动抢种，五天种玉茭等三百二十亩。石泉村抢种时妇女、儿童也都参加了，现已下种五百余亩。县政府为使下种胜利完成，曾指示各区村干部在下种期间应全力组织领导群众下种。并发放了救济粮四百石，贷款六百五十万元，解决群众下种期间生活、种籽等困难。最近又从腹地买来种籽七十九石多，发到各区（此项种籽可播种地一万二千四百十三亩），以保证灾区群众全部下种。
