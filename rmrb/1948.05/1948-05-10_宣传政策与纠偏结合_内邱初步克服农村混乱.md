　　Combining Policy Propaganda and Rectification
  　Neiqiu Initially Overcomes Rural Chaos
    [Our Report] According to a report from the Neiqiu Joint Office, Neiqiu has carried out the following work through propaganda and education, and rectification of deviations:

    First, reforming the poor peasant leagues and establishing production committees to lead and promote production. Their formation was based on popular elections, and the committees generally included upright, long-term working, and capable poor and hired peasants, Communist Party members, and cadres supported by the masses. For example, in Xiyangzhai village, bad elements and public security personnel were removed from the poor peasant league. The chairman of the poor peasant league in Jishangzhai village was not good and had very strict control over the masses. After discussion by the masses, he was removed and the poor peasant league was reorganized into a group. Production committees were established. After such reforms, many bad elements and cadres opposed by the masses were not elected as production committee members, and the power to lead production was actually held by the production committees. The focus shifted to production, and work began to be more orderly.

    Second, the chaotic phenomena were resolutely stopped, which played a significant role in stabilizing emotions. For example, the digging up of graves in the Second District (digging up the graves of landlords, and also the graves of middle peasants) was immediately stopped. It was more strictly announced that random beatings, hangings, and struggles were not allowed, and cadres were not allowed to be "removed" casually, and attitudes towards middle peasants were corrected, etc. These facts made the masses believe that our policies were not just talk, but were actually being implemented.

    Third, the policy of resolutely protecting and developing industry and commerce, and freedom of trade was promoted, which made the masses more at ease. Emphasis was also placed on solving the difficulties in the lives of the masses, such as the lack of food, livestock, and farm tools.

    Propaganda Combined with Action, People's Hearts Mostly Stabilized
    Due to the combination of propaganda and practical work, chaotic phenomena began to be overcome in various places, and people's hearts were stabilized. A middle peasant in Nanzhai village said: "After listening to the propaganda of the work team, I can work hard, and my heart feels lighter." He complained that the meeting was too late. He has now started to organize mutual aid. Dong Quanlu's father in Bailujiao, who used to be afraid and got sick, was carried to the meeting when the meeting was held. After listening to the meeting, he recovered from his illness. After the meeting in the Fourth District, the masses also felt satisfied. Middle peasants in Houzhuang and Liyu reflected: holding such a meeting is like a good rain falling on drought-stricken seedlings, which is very effective (meaning there is improvement). The mutual aid group in Chuanli village has been reorganized, the gardens have been planted, and women and men in Baitai are exchanging labor to solve the difficulties of seasonal change. Many villages in the Third District are requesting Golden Queen and August 1st grain seeds, requesting the export of mountain products, women are requesting cotton, requesting loans, and those who plant indigo are requesting skilled workers. Production throughout the county has begun to improve.

    Finally, the office pointed out to all county work comrades that there are still several problems that must be solved.

    Both Extremes Should Be Corrected
    (1) Pay attention to the relationship between poor and hired peasants and middle peasants. Before the work team went down, the poor and hired peasants were the most active (of course, some problems arose), but after this propaganda to unite with the middle peasants, and the use of administrative orders to stop and correct some abnormal actions, there are no more reports from the poor and hired peasants. We must pay close attention: if we say relying on the poor and hired peasants, we don’t pay attention to uniting with the middle peasants, and if we say uniting with the middle peasants, we don’t dare to talk about the poor and hired peasants, both of these extremes should be corrected. Only in this way can the middle and poor peasants be closely united. Going to one extreme will add unnecessary obstacles to the work.

    (2) Regarding the attitude towards village cadres, they pointed out: passively lying down, not actively being responsible for leading production, is a mistake on top of a mistake, burying one's own future, and no concession or forgiveness should be given. Some comrades, after arriving in the village, only say good things to the village cadres, unconditionally accommodating them, fearing that they will quit. This attitude is wrong and will instead fuel their arrogance and self-importance. They will not seriously correct their mistakes and will also make the masses dissatisfied with us, separating us from the masses. But some comrades, after going down, do not distinguish between good and bad cadres, and dismiss and attack them all, which is also wrong. Only by distinguishing between good and bad, and treating them differently, can the cadres become active and not become separated from the masses. In this issue, we cannot go to extremes either.

    (3) We must overcome the simple task-oriented view and the style of not paying attention to the masses' thoughts and actual conditions. For example, when formulating production plans, urging the masses to formulate them, saying, "If you can't formulate them, how can we report to the higher levels!" When investigating disaster victims, the masses could not discuss it, and the cadres said: "There must be a number, otherwise, how can we report it?" Many villages formulated textile plans, even they themselves said it was not accurate. This dishonest attitude and formalism must be overcome. We should go deep into a village, honestly do the work well, create experience, and promote others.

### 宣传政策与纠偏结合　内邱初步克服农村混乱

　　宣传政策与纠偏结合
  　内邱初步克服农村混乱
    【本报消息】根据内邱联合办公室报导，内邱经过宣传教育，进行纠偏，作了如下工作：
    第一、改造贫雇团，成立生产委员会，领导与推动生产。它的产生，由群众民选，一般的委员会内，有正派的长年劳动的与有能力的贫雇农，有党员，也有群众拥护的干部。如西羊寨村贫雇团中洗刷了坏分子与公安员，集上寨村贫雇团主席不好，对群众统治很严，经过群众讨论，把他撤换，并把贫雇团改成小组。成立了生产委员会。经过这样的改造，很多坏分子和群众反对的干部都没有当选为生产委员，把领导生产的权力实际上掌握在生产委员会手中，转向生产，工作初步有了秩序。
    第二、坚决停止了混乱现象，这对安定情绪起了很大作用。如二区的刨坟（刨地主的坟，也刨中农的坟），他们马上制止了。更严格的宣布了不许乱打、乱吊、乱斗争，不许随便“下”干部，纠正了对中农的态度等。这些事实，使群众相信了我们的政策，不是光说，而是实际这样做的。
    第三、宣传坚决保护与发展工商业政策，买卖自由，使群众更加安心。并强调解决群众生活中的困难，如粮食、牲口、农具缺乏等。
    宣传与行动结合人心大部稳定
    由于宣传与实际工作结合，各地开始克服了混乱现象，稳定了人心。南寨村一个中农说：“听了工作队的宣传，我可好好干哩，自己一下心轻了。”并埋怨开会太迟了。他现已插手组织互助。白鹿角董全禄爹，过去害怕得了病，开会时把他抬到会场，听了开会后，病也好了。四区开过会后，群众也感到满意，后庄、栗峪中农反映：开这样的会，好象天给旱苗下了一场好雨，即玲（即有起色的意思）了一大些。川里村互助组已整顿好，园地已种完，白塔妇女和男人变工，解决了换季困难。三区许多村要求金皇后、八一谷种籽，要求山货出口，妇女们要求棉花，要求贷款，种靛要求把式。全县生产已有起色。
    最后，办公室向全县工作同志指出目前还存在几个问题必须解决。
    两个极端都应纠正
    （一）注意贫雇农与中农的关系。工作队没下去前，贫雇最活跃（当然有些出了毛病），但经过这次团结中农的宣传，与用行政命令来制止与纠正了一些不正常的行动后。听不到贫雇多的反映了。我们要切实注意：一说依靠贫雇就不注意团结中农，一说团结中农就不敢说贫雇，这两个极端都应该纠正。这样才能使中贫农密切团结起来，如走一个极端，都会给工作上增加不应有的障碍。
    （二）对于村干部的态度，他们指出：消极躺倒、不积极负责领导生产，就是错上加错，自葬前途，一点不能迁就原谅，有些同志到村后，光给村干说好话，无原则的迁就，怕他不干了，村里工作没依靠。这种态度是不对的，反而助长他“离开我不行”的自大情绪，不会认真改错。也会使群众对我们不满，脱离了群众。但有些同志下去，对干部不分好坏，一律撇开，一律刺激打击，也是不对的。只有分清好坏，分别对待，干部才会积极起来，也不会脱离了群众。在这个问题上，也不能走极端。
    （三）要克服单纯任务观点与不注意群众思想与实际情况的作风，如订生产计划，催着群众订，说“订不出来，怎样往上级汇报！”调查灾民，群众讨论不出来，干部说：“总得有个数目字，要不，怎样汇报？”许多村订的纺织计划，连他们自己说也不确实。这种不老实态度与形式主义作风必须克服，应该深入一个村，老老实实把工作做好，创造出经验来，推动其他。
