To the Editor:

Regarding your newspaper's article published on April 30th concerning class designation in Chi Village, Yuanshi, along with the appended comments, we immediately convened a discussion among the work team and sought the opinions of village cadres after reading it. We feel that your comments are very accurate and have been of immense help to our work. We are now writing about our self-criticism and understanding.

(1) In this class designation in Chi Village, until the very end, the mentality of "finding enemies" still dominated, forming a grievance-airing struggle movement. This could lead to an uncalm and unscientific attitude. We feel this comment is very correct; this situation did exist here. For example, in the case of Li Youwen and two others, with twenty-eight mu of land and no hired long-term laborers, but lending money for two years, because of their bad behavior, the masses became indignant and insisted on classifying them as rich peasants. Even during the secondary class designation correction, some people still couldn't understand this. "Isn't there an unjustly killed ghost in every temple? Let's just gloss over it!" This is indeed one of the reasons for over-designating landlords and rich peasants. On the other hand, the grievance-airing struggle here has achieved considerable success in actual practice. First, this grievance-airing struggle is not the same old routine. The grievance-airing is about airing one's own suffering from exploitation, thus exposing the exploitation facts of landlords and rich peasants. If the landlords and rich peasants don't admit the facts after they are stated, a reasoning struggle is launched. It's not a universal airing, but rather finding typical cases. Moreover, this grievance-airing is carried out after the masses have studied class designation and established considerable policy thinking, so generally there are no problems. Second, through grievance-airing struggle, the masses have found the root of their poverty and raised their class consciousness. Third, after airing grievances against typical landlords and rich peasants, the power of the peasants is demonstrated, making the general landlords and rich peasants no longer dare to openly sabotage or engage in activities. Fourth, after airing the bitterness of exploitation, landlords and rich peasants can raise any factual inconsistencies; if they unreasonably refute the facts, the masses will launch a reasoning struggle, which can make the landlords and rich peasants inwardly convinced. Grievance-airing is focused, not universal; air grievances if there are any, and don't if there aren't.

(2) Regarding several specific households:

    I. Shi Qunshan: Five people with sixty-eight mu of land, hiring two long-term laborers, living not in hardship. The basis for designating him as a new rich peasant is that he started his business through his own labor, is a good person in the village, lost some land due to serving as a Bao chief, treats long-term laborers well, and pays higher wages than the average long-term laborer. At the end of the year, he gives more. If the long-term laborers do legitimate things (such as buying land, etc.), he also adds some money.

    II. Shi Erchou: Ten people with fifty-two mu of land, one person participating in labor, one long-term laborer, thirty short-term laborers. Last time, Erchou was singled out, and the family was designated as a landlord, thus raising the family's class status. Because he is in the position of the master and is not subject to significant exploitation, he should not be designated separately. This has been corrected this time, and the whole family is designated as rich peasants. The three households that were wrongly designated last time have all been corrected.

    III. Shi Delu (i.e., Luzi), designated as a vagrant because his main source of livelihood after decline is extortion and fraud. Last time, he was written as a rogue element because I was not familiar with the documents and because of my careless work style. Please correct whether the above opinions are correct or not.

To Comrades Song and Sun:

We believe that your serious attitude in conscientiously studying the opinions of the Party newspaper and reviewing your thoughts, emotions, and work is commendable. We believe that airing the bitterness of exploitation by landlords and rich peasants to expose their crimes of exploitation and oppression, as mentioned in your letter, is necessary in mobilizing the peasants. However, one issue must be considered: is it easy to arouse public indignation and raise class status if it is carried out simultaneously with class designation? Or, even if the status is not raised, will designating other statuses create difficulties for future unity? Because class status has not been finally assessed, it is not certain whether they are landlords and rich peasants. Therefore, our opinion is that it is best to do it after the designation is completed. As for revealing the income from exploitation during class designation, it is necessary, but it should not be turned into a general grievance-airing struggle.

### 池村工作组根据本报意见　改正划阶级中错订成份

专栏：

　　池村工作组根据本报意见
  　改正划阶级中错订成份编辑同志：
    贵报四月三十日发表元氏池村划阶级一文，后边附有几点意见，我们看后，即召集工作团讨论，并征求村干部的意见。感到你们所提意见很对，对我们的工作实有莫大之帮助，兹就我们的检讨与认识写出。
    （一）池村这次划阶级，直到最后，还是“找敌人”的情绪支配着，形成诉苦斗争运动。这可能产生不冷静、不科学的态度。这个意见，我们感到很对，这里是有这种情况。如李有文三人，二十八亩地，没雇长工，放债二年，因行为不好，群众激忿，硬要把他划成富农。直到二次划阶级改正时，还有些人打不通思想。“那个庙没个屈死鬼？马虎点过去吧！”这确实是造成多划地主富农的原因之一。另方面，这里的诉苦斗争，在实际运动中取得不少成绩。一、这种诉苦斗争不是老一套的。诉苦是诉自己受剥削的苦，这样就把地主富农剥削事实诉出来了。实事诉出之后，地富如不承认，即展开讲理斗争。并不是普遍的诉，而是找典型的诉。并且这种诉苦是在群众学习划阶级之后，树立了相当政策思想之后进行的，一般不会出什么问题。二、经过诉苦斗争，群众找到了自己的穷根，提高了阶级觉悟。三、对典型地主富农诉苦之后，显示了农民的力量，使一般地富再不敢公开的破坏、活动。四、诉出剥削苦之后，不合事实的，地主富农可以提出来；不认事实的无理辩驳，群众即开展讲理斗争，这才能使地富内心服气。诉苦是有重点的诉，不是普遍的诉，有苦就诉，没苦就不诉。
    （二）关于几个具体户的问题：
    一、师群山：五人地六八亩，雇长工两个，生活并不困难。划新富农的根据，是本人劳动起家，在村为人好，因当保长赔了几亩地，对待长工好，比一般长工工资较高。年底并多给一些。长工如果干正经事（如买地等），还给添一些钱。
    二、师二丑：十人五十二亩地，一人参加劳动，长工一个，短工三十个，上次把二丑摘出，家庭划为地主，这样提高了家庭成份。因他本人处于主人地位，不是受显著的剥削，不应另划，这次已改过，全家划为富农。上次这样错划的三户，已全部改正。
    三、师德禄（即禄子），划为游民，是因下降后靠敲诈欺骗为主要生活来源，上次写为流氓分子，是因我对文件不熟悉，及粗枝大叶作风所致。以上意见正确与否，盼指正。
  　宋安祥、孙成文
    宋、孙二同志：
    你们认真研究党报意见，检讨思想情绪与工作，我们认为是很好的严肃的态度。来信所提对地主富农诉剥削苦，揭发其剥削压迫的罪恶，我们认为在发动农民中是需要的。但须考虑一个问题。即是与划阶级同时进行，是否容易激起众忿，提高成份？或虽不提高，订成其他成份，而造成以后团结的困难！因为阶级成份没有最后评定，是否地主富农还不能肯定。所以我们的意见，最好是划定以后再说。至于划阶级时要揭发剥削收入，则是必须的，只是不要搞成一般的诉苦斗争。
