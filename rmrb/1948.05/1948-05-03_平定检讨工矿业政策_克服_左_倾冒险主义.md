Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 1st: The Pingding County government profoundly reviewed the erroneous tendencies existing in the implementation of industrial and mining policies in the county on the 14th of last month and determined future construction guidelines. The county government has already issued instructions to its subordinates on this matter. The instructions first pointed out that the erroneous tendencies in the past implementation of policies were: (1) A vague understanding of the policy of protecting industry and mining, treating bureaucratic capital and private capital equally, not considering long-term plans, and only caring about the immediate interests of the masses. (2) Although the government had issued four announcements to protect construction and strictly prohibit sabotage, it did not take active measures, but instead accommodated the saboteurs, thinking that they were poor people who had no way to live, and did not deal with them, which further encouraged the development of sabotage. Wang Liben, a worker at a certain foundry, dismantled the high cart to make grenades. The Industrial Bureau regularly went to Pingding to buy equipment, which further attracted a part of the masses to sabotage (the purchase has now been stopped). The poor peasant group in Longfenggou sold two water pumps from a kiln owner, obtaining a total of thirty *shi* of rice (and also divided part of a gas pipe), filled pits and made up for deficiencies, and dispersed the old funds, which affected the development of production. The twenty-five *shi* of grain and two hundred *jin* of oil stored in the Pingji mine were all distributed by the workers. The workers of the Fuju Mine in Lijiazhuang sold the stored coal for eight *shi* of rice as a distribution of fruits. After the workers took over the mines, they only cooperated on empty stalls, earning as much as they could divide, but no one built the damaged kilns, so production gradually shrunk and regressed; moreover, no private capital was absorbed to develop industry. In one village, a middle peasant invested a little capital, but did not dare to share dividends, thinking that sharing dividends was exploitation. (3) There was a tendency of anarchism in the workers' movement. Due to the guiding ideology of "workers managing factories" and "workers being masters of the house," an extremely democratic phenomenon was created among some workers. Absolute equality was practiced for wages, with skilled workers and unskilled workers receiving the same wages, believing that inequality was exploitation. Technical skills were not promoted and rewarded, and some even discriminated against and attacked technical workers. Wang Sen, the former foreman of a certain mine, was a high-level technical worker in the county. The workers said that he was helping capitalists exploit workers and rejected him (now he is the head of the mining affairs section of the Fourth Mine). Four foremen were demoted, one of whom became an ordinary worker. A certain iron furnace produced good goods, but they dared not sell them publicly, because the furnaces that delivered inferior goods would satirize those that delivered good goods, creating a situation where technology was looking to catch up with the backward.

The instructions mentioned that Pingding's industry and mining had made certain achievements in the past year, especially the development of cooperative iron furnaces. However, the above-mentioned "leftist" adventurist tendencies did exist, which was actually a suicide policy for industry and mining. The basic reason for its occurrence was the lack of understanding of the policy of protecting industry and commerce in the leading ideology, and mechanically moving the set of rural policies to the industrial and mining aspects. Because there was no distinction between feudal and capitalist exploitation, all exploitation was negated, and the policy toward the feudal class was used to treat industry and mining, confiscating industry and mining without principle, and erroneous measures such as dispersing funds, excluding technology, and abolishing leadership occurred. Secondly, the mass line and mass viewpoint were confused with tailism, emphasizing the solution of the temporary interests of a few people, while destroying the long-term interests of many people, destroying coal mines that had been mined for decades in half a year, and "filling pits" with machines, causing significant losses to industry.

The instructions pointed out that in order to meet the needs of the situation, industry and mining construction should be vigorously developed in the future, and the above-mentioned errors should be quickly corrected in accordance with the spirit of the Border Region Committee's instructions on protecting industry and mining. (1) All industry and mining operated by bureaucratic capitalists shall be confiscated and managed by the government. The Baojin Gong Mine Hanhegou, formerly managed by the bureaucratic capitalist Baojin Company, has been formally announced confiscated and directly managed by the county government. (2) All other mines operated by general capitalists, regardless of whether they are landlords or not, shall not be confiscated. Only their landlord feudal exploitation shall be reformed, and their mine and factory materials shall not be liquidated. All localities should check according to this principle, and those that have been wrongly confiscated and liquidated should be corrected. If the mine owner is not present, the government should manage it on their behalf or lease it to private individuals for operation. When the factory owner returns, it should be returned to the original owner. The original owner should return the funds invested during the trusteeship or operate as a joint venture. The Yili Mine, Jinhua Mine, Qixing Mine, Jinchang Mine, Jisheng Mine, etc., as well as their large carts, machines, and materials, should be protected by the workers of the original mine and the local district and village governments in accordance with this spirit, and should not be destroyed or dispersed. If there is an agent, they can operate on their behalf, and the original owner should be mobilized to return to operate and mine as much as possible. If the original owner is unable to operate, they can sell or request government assistance or purchase for operation, but they cannot destroy or disperse. The government has also formally notified Yang Erniu, the owner of the Dehou Mine in Xihou, to operate the mine himself, and the government will provide appropriate support and encourage the development of private capital. (3) In the future, all industry and mining that complies with government laws and regulations and conducts business shall have their property ownership, freedom of operation, and legitimate profits protected by the government in accordance with the law, and no individual or group shall infringe upon them. Private investment should be encouraged, and reasonable profit sharing should be implemented. (4) In terms of worker movement: worker education should be improved, factories should be cherished, and production should be actively increased. The relationship between workers and factory owners in factories and mines should follow the principles of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, benefiting both public and private, and benefiting both labor and capital." Workers should have appropriate working conditions (not too high), and factory owners should also obtain appropriate profits. (5) Technology should be rewarded and improved, and the idea of egalitarianism should be overcome. Only in this way can technology be improved and production can continue to develop. Workers and farmers should be educated to study technology well, and old technical workers should be boldly used, patiently educated to overcome their conservative ideas, and impart technology. Wages should be determined according to the quality of technology and rewards should be given to encourage everyone to compete, improve technology, and develop production.

### 平定检讨工矿业政策　克服“左”倾冒险主义

　　平定检讨工矿业政策
  　克服“左”倾冒险主义
    【新华社晋察冀一日电】平定县政府于上月十四日深刻检讨了该县执行工矿业政策中存在的错误倾向，并定出今后建设方针。该县府已于日前就此对所属发出指示，指示中首先指出过去执行政策中的错误倾向为：（一）对保护工矿业政策认识模糊，不分别官僚资本与私人资本，同等处置，不从长期打算，只管群众眼前。（二）政府虽曾布告四次保护建设，严禁破坏，但没有采取积极处置，反而迁就破坏者，以为他们是没法生活的穷人，不加处理，更助长了破坏的发展。某翻砂厂工人王立本把高车拆卸，制造手榴弹，工业局经常到平定收买器材，更吸引了一部群众的破坏（现已停止收买）。龙凤沟贫农团将某窑主的抽水机出卖了两个，共得三十石米（还分了一部气管），填坑补了缺，并分散了旧有资金，影响了生产的发展。平记矿所存的二十五石粮，二百余斤油都被工人分配。李家庄阜聚矿工人将存炭卖了得米八石，作了果实分配。工人接收矿坑后，只是在空摊子上劳力合作，赚多少分多少，窑坑坏了却没人建设，所以生产逐渐缩小、倒退；更没有吸收私资，发展工业。有个村一个中农投了点资，也不敢分红，认为分红就是剥削。（三）工人运动中存在着无政府主义的倾向，由于“工人管工厂”、“工人当家”的思想指导，造成一部分工人的极端民主的现象，对工资实行绝对平均，技工与笨工工资平均，认为不平均就是剥削。对技术不是提倡奖励，有的还歧视打击技术工人。某矿旧领师王森，他是本县高等技术工人，工人们说他是帮助资本家剥削工人的，排斥他（现在四矿当矿务科长）。有四个领师都降级使用，其中一个领师当了普通工人。某一铁炉出了好货，不敢公开出售，因为交劣货的炉看见交好货的就要讽刺，造成了技术向落后看齐。
    指示中提到平定工矿业一年来是有一定成绩的，特别是合作铁炉的发展。但确实存在着上述“左”倾冒险倾向，实际是工矿业的自杀政策。其产生的基本原因，是领导思想对保护工商业方针认识不足，把农村政策的一套，机械的搬到工矿业方面来。由于没有区别封建性与资本主义性的剥削，因而否定一切剥削，把对待封建阶级的政策对待工矿业，无原则的没收工矿业，并且发生了分散资金、排斥技术、取消领导等错误措施。其次，是把群众路线群众观点和尾巴主义混淆不清，强调解决少数人的暂时利益，而破坏了许多人民的长远利益，将开采数十年的煤矿在半年内破坏了，机器“填坑”了，造成了工业上的重大损失。
    该指示提出，为了适应形势需要，今后应大力发展工矿建设，根据边委会保护工矿业指示的精神，迅速纠正上述错误。（一）凡属官僚资本家经营的工矿，一律没收，归政府管理。原属官僚资本保晋公司经管之保晋公矿汗河沟，已正式宣布没收，由县政府直接管理。（二）其他所有一般资本家经营的矿山，不管他本人是否兼地主，一律不能没收，只能改革他的地主封建剥削部分，而不应清算其矿山工厂资材。各地应根据这一原则检查，已被没收清算错的，要进行纠正。如果矿主不在，应由政府代管或由政府租给私人经营，厂主回来归还原主。代管时投入的资金原主应归还或作合股经营。义利矿、晋华矿、气兴矿、晋昌矿、济生等矿及其大车、机器、资财，均根据此一精神，由原矿工人与所在区村政府负责保护，不得破坏分散，如有代理人可代为经营，尽量动员原主回来经营开采，如果原主无力经营，可以转卖或请求政府帮助或收买经营，但不能破坏分散。政府并已正式通知西河德厚矿主杨二牛自己经营该矿，政府并适当扶植鼓励私人资本发展。（三）今后凡属遵守政府法令，进行营业的工矿，政府依法保护其财产所有权，经营自由权，与正当的营利，任何个人团体不应侵犯。并鼓励私人投资，实行合理分红。（四）工运方面：应提高工人阶级教育，爱护工厂，积极增加生产，工厂矿工中工人与厂主关系应遵照“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的原则，工人应有适当劳动条件（不应过高），同时厂主亦应取得适当利润。（五）奖励与提高技术，克服平均主义思想，只有这样技术才能提高，生产事业才能不断发展。要教育工人、农民很好研究技术，对旧技术工人要大胆使用，耐心的教育克服其保守思想，传授技术。工资应按技术好坏确定，并进行奖励，使大家竞赛，提高技术，发展生产。
