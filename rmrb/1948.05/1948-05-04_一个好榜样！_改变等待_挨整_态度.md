　　A Good Example!
  　Change the Attitude of Waiting to be "Rectified"
    After hearing the news of the Party rectification and democratic movement, the village cadres in Anyang Village, Pingshun, took the initiative to reverse the relationship between the Party and the masses through exemplary actions of actively promoting the interests of the people and eliminating malpractices. This is a completely necessary and completely correct good method. According to the Party rectification materials from various places, the vast majority of our cadres and party members, after education and transformation, are able to correct their mistakes, improve their work style, and work actively, and are able to win the support of the people. However, in many places, some comrades, hearing some rumors, lie down and do no work, preparing to be "rectified," or are afraid of making mistakes, become hesitant, and abandon the glorious responsibility of cadres and party members leading the masses, creating a state of anarchy in village-level work, which is a great loss to both work and individuals. We hope that cadres and party members in various places will learn from the working spirit of the cadres and party members in Anyang Village, actively think of ways for the masses in spring plowing and production, solve difficulties, promote benefits and eliminate malpractices, and do good deeds. Conscientiously correct mistakes, transform themselves, and pave the way for the smooth resolution of the relationship between the Party and the masses. We believe that as long as cadres and party members consciously serve the masses, the Party rectification and democratic movement will have a solid foundation for successful completion.

　　一个好榜样！
  　改变等待“挨整”态度
    平顺安阳村干部听到整党民主消息后，以积极为人民兴利除弊的模范行动，主动扭转党群关系，这是完全必要，完全正确的好办法。根据各地整党材料证明：我们绝大部分干部党员经过教育改造是能够纠正错误，改善作风，积极工作。并且是能够取得人民拥护的。但在不少地方，有些同志听到一些风声，便躺倒不做工作，准备“挨整”，或是怕犯错，束手束脚，放弃了干部党员领导群众的光荣责任，造成村级工作无政府状态，对工作对个人都是一个很大的损失，我们希望各地干部党员都来学习安阳村干部党员的工作精神，在春耕生产中积极为群众想办法，解决困难，兴利除弊做好事，认真改正错误，改造自己，给解决党群关系顺利的铺平道路。我们相信，只要干部党员自觉的为群众服务，整党民主运动便有了顺利完成的基础。
