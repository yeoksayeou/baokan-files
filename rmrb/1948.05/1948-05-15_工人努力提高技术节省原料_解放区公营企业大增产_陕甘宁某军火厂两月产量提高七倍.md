Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Since the "February 7th" movement, state-owned factories in Northwest, East China, and Jin-Cha-Ji and other liberated areas have universally launched production increase emulation campaigns to support the front lines, achieving great results. A certain factory of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Joint Defense Region ordnance factory that produces detonators increased its output in April by seven times compared to February, creating an unprecedented record for the factory. Zhang Xiangying, an apprentice who made artillery shells in a certain factory, increased production by 100% in April compared to February, and reduced waste from 1.3% in February to 0.7%. The production rate of a certain ordnance factory in Jin-Cha-Ji increased by an average of 80%. The output of a certain clothing factory in Northwest China increased by more than 63% in March compared to February. Worker Dang Wanhua can sew an average of 32 upper garments (equivalent to 22 sets) per day. In a certain clothing factory in Central China, worker Li Guiguan worked while ill, averaging 23 sets per day, exceeding the original plan by 60%. In a certain clothing factory in East China, garment worker Zheng Songhua increased his output from 70 pieces per day to 150 pieces per day, and the factory's total output also increased by 70%. Typesetting in the typesetting room of the Xinhua Bookstore Printing Factory in Central China was also 44% higher than in the past.

Workers are striving to improve technology, improve tools, and save raw materials. Workers in a certain ordnance factory in Northwest China transformed the tool for manufacturing a certain part of artillery shells, reducing two procedures to one, resulting in a doubling of output. Zhang Xingren, a worker in a certain factory, used the current from a battery to start the engine through the distributor of a magneto, solving the power problem and increasing output. A certain factory used a substitute for sesame oil, reducing consumption of that item to one twenty-third of the original amount. A certain shoe factory in Jin-Cha-Ji saved a total of over 91 million yuan in raw materials in mid-March. A certain ordnance factory saved two-thirds of the amount of machine oil used. A certain ordnance factory in Northwest China vigorously improved the skills of apprentices. Now, the number of people has been reduced by 29%, while the output has doubled, and the quality is also good.

The workers' work attitude has improved, and the phenomena of going to work early and leaving late, and working overtime voluntarily are common. The slogan of everyone is "Let's sweat more, so the front line will bleed less." In the competition, workers also promoted, inspected, and evaluated each other, demonstrating the high level of consciousness that workers in new democratic state-owned enterprises should have.

Furthermore, when Weihaiwei City was occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits last year, many factories moved from the city to the countryside. Under the leadership of the trade union, the workers voluntarily reduced their living standards, eating one-quarter of peanut cakes, and the wages of textile factories were reduced from 15 catties of grain per bolt of cloth to 10 catties of grain. However, output increased; workers increased from weaving nine bolts of cloth per day to fourteen bolts of cloth per day, and the output of the Far East Shoe Store also increased by one-third. After the recovery of Weihaiwei City, the rural workers returned to the city and are now assisting the factory in actively restoring Weihaiwei's industry and commerce destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

    工人努力提高技术节省原料
    解放区公营企业大增产
    陕甘宁某军火厂两月产量提高七倍
    【新华社陕北十三日电】西北、华东、晋察冀等地工营工厂自“二七”以来遍普展开支援前线增产竞赛运动，收到了很大成绩。陕甘宁晋绥联防军区军火工厂某厂装置雷管，四月份较二月份产量提高了七倍，创造了该厂空前记录。某厂车炮弹学徒张向应，四月份较二月份增产百分之百，废活从二月份的百分之一点三减至百分之零点七。晋察冀某军火工厂生产率平均提高了百分之八十。西北某被服厂三月份产量较二月份提高了百分之六十三强，工人党万华每天平均可轧三十二件上衣（折合二十二套）。华中某被服厂工人李桂官抱病工作，平均每天轧二十三套，超过原订计划百分之六十。华东某被服厂裁衣工人郑松华由每天裁七十件增加到每天裁百五十件，该厂总产量也提高了百分之七十。华中新华书店印刷厂排字房排字亦比过去提高百分之四十四。
    工人都努力提高技术改良工具与节省原料。西北某军火工厂工人改造了制造炮弹上某种零件的工具，使两道手续减为一道，致产量提高一倍。某厂工人张兴仁利用电瓶电流通过磁石发电机的分电盘来发动引擎，解决了电力困难，提高了产量。某厂用麻油的代用品，使该项消耗减少到原来的二十三分之一。晋察冀某鞋厂三月中节省原料总值达九千一百余万元。某军火工厂仅擦机油一项就节省了三分之二。西北某军火工厂大力提高学徒技术，现在人数减少了百分之二十九，而产量却增加了一倍，质量亦佳。
    工人们的劳动态度都有进步，上工早下工迟、自动加工是普遍现象。大家的口号是“咱们多流汗，前线少流血”。竞赛中工人并互相推动、检查、评判，表现了新民主主义公营企业中工人应有的高度自觉。
    又讯：威海卫市去年为蒋匪侵占时，许多工厂由市内迁到农村，工人在工会领导下自动降低生活水平，吃四分之一的花生饼，纺织厂工资由每匹布十五斤粮减至十斤粮。但产量增加；工人由每人每日织九匹布增至十四匹，远东鞋铺产量也提高了三分之一。威市收复后，乡间工人回到市内，正协助厂方积极恢复被蒋匪摧毁的威市工商业。
