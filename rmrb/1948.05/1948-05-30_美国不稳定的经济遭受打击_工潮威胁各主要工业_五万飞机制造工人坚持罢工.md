Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th -- Comprehensive Report: The surging wave of American workers' strikes is inflicting a heavy blow on the unstable American economy. The strikes of 100,000 meatpacking workers and 50,000 aircraft manufacturing workers, which have lasted for many days, are still being heroically maintained. "Fourteen major industrial sectors in the United States are 'facing the threat of strikes.'" (Associated Press, May 1st). In the automotive industry, the first major auto workers' strike since the winter of 1945 has begun with the strike of 75,000 Chrysler workers on the 12th, and the strike threat of 225,000 auto manufacturing workers is looming over General Motors' 90 factories across the country. The Associated Press reported on the 18th that the CIO's auto workers' union is planning to issue a strike order to General Motors within half a month. Although the national railway workers' strike, originally scheduled to begin on the 11th, was temporarily suspended due to the Truman administration's order to take over on the 10th, railway workers are still insisting on their wage increase demands. According to a United Press report, negotiations between labor and management on the long-unresolved issues broke down on the 22nd. The Mine Workers Union, with over 400,000 members, is facing a new crisis after the recent major strike for pensions, as the contract expires on June 30th. Agence France-Presse reported from Washington on the 19th that the president of the miners' union, Lewis, refused to continue negotiations after negotiating with the employers for 24 hours, because the employers refused to sign the previous contract. Other enterprises brewing strikes due to expiring contracts include the CIO's Electrical Workers Union with 200,000 members, the International Harvester Company Union with 40,000 members, the Dockworkers Union with 50,000 members, and the Telephone Workers Union. Agence France-Presse reported on the 19th that even the AFL's Oak Ridge Atomic Plant Workers Union is threatening to strike under a certain emotional atmosphere. The main reason for the current labor unrest in the United States is "the near boiling point of labor-management relations" (Associated Press), caused by the unreasonable refusal of employers to meet the legitimate wage increase demands of workers. On the one hand, "major capitalists led by US Steel Corporation "refuse the workers' demands in order to pass on the costs of the Marshall Plan to the workers" (TASS, May 11th); on the other hand, the real wages of the American working class have fallen by 15% due to inflation (CIO economic advisor's March statistics), forcing them to rise up and counter the vicious attacks of monopoly capital on the living standards of labor.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th -- Under the control of imperialist foreign policy, American foreign trade cannot be expanded, but instead is trending towards shrinking. According to the official US news agency, the US Information Service, a New York dispatch on April 13th admitted: "The US Department of Commerce and private economists both estimate that the total value of US goods and services exports this year will only be 90% of the exports in 1947." In mid-February, the director of the International Trade Company of the US Department of Commerce also admitted that even if Congress passes the Marshall Plan, "the total value of US exports this year will still decrease by 10%," which shows that the so-called "Marshall Plan" cannot solve the difficulty of the shrinking US international market. According to the total value of US exports, it reached 15 billion US dollars in 1946, fell to 14.4 billion US dollars last year, and will fall to about 13 billion US dollars this year according to the Department of Commerce's estimate.

　　美国不稳定的经济遭受打击
  　工潮威胁各主要工业
  　五万飞机制造工人坚持罢工
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】综合报导：风起云涌的美国工人罢工斗争，正予美国不稳定的经济以沉重的打击。持续多日的十万肉类包装工人及五万飞机制造工人的罢工，仍在英勇坚持。美国十四种主要工业部门，“又正面临着罢工的威胁。”（美联社五月一日电）在汽车业方面，自一九四五年冬以来的首次汽车工人大罢工，已以克利斯勒公司七万五千工人十二日的罢工揭开序幕，而二十二万五千汽车制造工人的罢工威胁，正笼罩着美国通用汽车公司遍及全国的九十个工厂。美联社十八日电称：产联的汽车工人工会，正计划在半月内向通用汽车公司发出罢工命令。原订十一日开始的全国铁路工人大罢工，虽因杜鲁门政府十日下令接收而暂缓爆发，但铁路工人迄今仍在坚持其增资要求。据合众社电称，劳资双方对长期未决的谈判，二十二日已告破裂。拥有会员四十余万的矿工联合会，在最近争取养老金的大罢工之后，又因合同将于六月三十日满期而面临新的危机。据法新社华盛顿十九日电称：矿工工会主席路易斯在与资方谈判二十四小时后，已因资方拒签前次合同而拒绝继续谈判。其他企业中因合同行将满期而酝酿罢工者，计会有产联所属拥有二十万会员的电气工会，拥有四万会员的万国农具公司工会，拥有五万会员的码头工会及电话工会等。据法新社十九日电称：甚至劳联的橡树岭原子厂工人工会，亦在某种激动的情绪笼罩下威胁着要罢工。美国目前工潮的主要原因是“劳资关系的接近沸点”（美联社），资方无理拒绝工人的正当增资要求所致。一方面以“美国钢公司为首的大资本家“拒绝工人要求，以便将马歇尔计划所支出的费用转嫁于工人头上”（塔斯社十一日电）；另一方面美国工人阶级的实际工资，已因通货膨胀之害而跌落了百分之十五（产联经济顾问三月份统计），不得不起而反击独占资本向劳工生活水准的恶毒进攻。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】在帝国主义外交政策支配下的美国对外贸易，不但不能扩大，反而更趋缩小。据美官方通讯社美国新闻处四月十三日承认纽约电讯：“美商务部及私人经济学家，均估计本年度美物资及服务之输出，其总值将只及一九四七年输出的百分之九十。”二月中旬，美商务部国际贸易公司司长亦承认：国会即使通过马歇尔计划，“美国今年的输出总值仍将减少百分之十”，这说明所谓“马歇尔计划”是不能解决美国国际市场日益缩小之困难的。按美国输出总值，一九四六年达一百五十亿美元，去年已跌至一百四十四亿美元，今年如依照商务部的估计，则将跌至一百三十亿元左右。
