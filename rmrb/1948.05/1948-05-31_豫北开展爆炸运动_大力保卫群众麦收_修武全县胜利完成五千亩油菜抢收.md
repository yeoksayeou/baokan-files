[This dispatch comes from our own correspondent in] Taihang, 24th. Under the circumstances that the enemy and puppets in northern Henan and central Shanxi are actively preparing to seize wheat, the border counties of the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Districts of Taihang are also vigorously mobilizing and organizing to defend the wheat harvest. It is reported that Cheng Daosheng and Liu Lexian's bandit troops from Anyang and the puppet county security regiment are conducting wheat-grabbing training. On May 4th, the enemy's 116th Regiment conducted a night wheat-grabbing exercise in Qiukou and Sanjiazhuang areas. Zhao Guangchen, the puppet commissioner of the Third Administrative District, held a meeting in Duanshao Village on April 24th to restore the supervisory district organization and secret society gates. Immediately afterward, he convened a meeting of puppet bao and jia chiefs and ordered each bao to organize puppet self-defense forces. On the 28th, the bandit Yexi Township Office concentrated secret society gates in Qijiazhuang to mobilize preparations for wheat grabbing, saying, "If we can't grab wheat, we won't survive," and ordered each bao to have 500 sickles. From May 1st to 3rd, bandits from Xiangzhen, Xinyezhen, Honghe Township, Zhongshan Township, Yexi Township, Jian'an Township, etc., summoned each bao chief to register livestock carts and male and female labor (males from 15 to 45, females from 18 to 45), ordering each person to prepare a sickle and carrying rope, etc. They also demanded 100 people from each bao in the city to organize secret society self-defense teams, stretcher teams, and transportation teams to take turns looting during the wheat grab. In order to grab wheat, the enemy stipulated that if the common people grabbed one dou [peck], they would get five sheng [tenths of a peck], the army would get three sheng, and the township office would get two sheng, and deceived the masses by saying that whoever delivered grain would not be robbed. In order to provoke and create antagonism between us and the masses in the Chiang-occupied areas, they also proposed to the secret societies, "Don't fight the Eighth Route Army, only fight the militia," to create a mass wheat grab towards us by the masses in the Chiang area. If they couldn't grab it, they would burn it with fire. At the same time, during the wheat grab, the enemy also prepared to arrest conscripts on a large scale. The enemy has now demanded six strong men and four soldiers from each bao. If there are no strong men and soldiers, they must give twelve shi [about 120 liters] of wheat. The bandit supervisory district plans to seize at least a battalion of troops during the wheat grab. In Jiaozuo, a meeting of puppet county magistrates from the eight counties of Huaifu under the enemy and puppets was recently held in Xinxiang. Chiang's bandits in various places are stepping up the expansion of local bandit armed forces and coercing the masses to organize puppet "self-defense corps." Li Leshan, the special agent and town chief of Encun Township, has begun to organize the Red Spear Society. Jiao (Zuo), Xiu (wu), and Bo (ai) have established a joint village association to prepare for large-scale grain grabbing and conscription. In addition to organizing puppet reserve and standing self-defense forces in various townships and towns in Chiang-occupied Jiaozuo, an order has been issued to each village to make spears, and each member of the puppet self-defense force has been given two hand grenades. Recently, local bandits have been actively harassing our border areas, attempting to attack and disintegrate our militia, develop maintenance, and achieve wheat grabbing. Yuan Shiming, the deputy captain of the puppet Qian Dong Township Brigade in Xiuwu, surrounded our Dongxi Zhujin at dawn on the 6th. After our militia transferred and the enemy's attack failed, they brutally killed and took away the masses to use threats to disintegrate our militia, and claimed, "If we don't maintain, we won't be able to eat wheat." In our border counties, various places have been making specific arrangements to defend the wheat harvest based on the enemy's situation. The Fifth District Committee convened a meeting of the Commissioner's Office and various departments of the sub-district on May 1st to specifically discuss the issue of defending the wheat harvest, proposing that all forces of the Party, government, army, and people must be immediately and fully mobilized to participate in the struggle to defend the wheat harvest, and that under unified leadership, everyone should be encouraged to come up with ideas and methods to protect the wheat. All commanders and fighters of the troops must launch a campaign to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service on the basis of ideological awareness gained from land reform studies, compete to kill enemies and capture prisoners, and help the masses harvest. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the joint defense mechanism, carry out mass guerrilla warfare, organize flying explosion teams, and carry out disintegration work on secret societies and deceived masses. The border counties of the sub-district have also begun preparations. The local armed forces active in the front lines have taken the initiative to attack and have repeatedly won victories. In the first ten days of this month alone, they have successively eliminated more than 70 enemy soldiers who came out to harass. The Jiaozuo and Xiuwu rotation teams and militia of the Fourth District are becoming more active. After Xiuwu proposed launching a campaign of 10,000 landmine explosions, the Second and Third Districts have now rushed to produce a batch of new mines. In Shouyang of the Second District, in order to improve tactics and universally launch an explosion campaign to protect wheat, an explosion training class with more than 60 people has been opened to specialize in improving explosion techniques. In mid-May, the military and civilians of Xiuwu County were unanimously mobilized and successfully completed the emergency harvesting of 5,000 mu of rapeseed. This victory on the eve of the wheat harvest has greatly increased the confidence of the masses in the border areas in the struggle to protect the wheat.
