Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th—Reports from various sources indicate that as the thief Chiang Kai-shek and the thief Li Zongren simultaneously took the stage as the pseudo-president and pseudo-vice president in Nanjing on the 20th, patriotic and democratic movements erupted among students in Nanjing and Shanghai, the very heartland of the Chiang bandit, delivering a forceful blow to this shameful farce. On the evening of the 21st (erroneously reported as the 20th), university students in Nanjing jointly held a "May 20th Massacre Anniversary Commemoration Meeting" on the lawn of Central University, commemorating the anniversary of the brutal suppression of Nanjing students by Chiang's bandits a year ago. At the meeting, students performed a skit depicting the national thief Yuan Shikai proclaiming himself emperor, only to be overthrown by the people of the whole country. Chiang Party secret agents, who had been lying in wait, immediately tore down slogans posted by students on the walls, such as those opposing oppression, opposing the Kuomintang's selling of resources in South China, and opposing American imperialism's support for Japan, and extinguished the lights, disrupting the order of the meeting.

After the meeting, Chiang's agents beat students in the streets and arrested two students each from Jinling University and Central University at places like Gulou, taking them to the Chiang Party's secret service organization, the "Youth Department." Upon hearing the news, students from the two universities were outraged and gathered more than two thousand students (according to Reuters) at approximately 1:00 AM on the 21st, surrounding the department and making stern demands, including the immediate restoration of freedom to the arrested students, the handing over of the main culprits, and an apology to the students. Disregarding the obstruction and surveillance of Chiang's police and guards, they wrote slogans in ink and chalk on the walls of the department and shouted slogans such as "Dissolve the secret service organization," "Dissolve the Youth Department," "Down with the secret service running dogs," and "Severely punish the murderers," and referred to the Kuomintang as the "Plundering Party." They bravely surrounded the Chiang Party's "Youth Department" for more than ten hours. Under the students' strong power, the Chiang Party was forced to release the four arrested students from Jinling and Central Universities one after another.

After achieving this initial victory, the students left the department at 3:00 PM on the 22nd for a demonstration parade, passing by the Chiang bandit's pseudo-National Assembly Hall and the pseudo-Presidential Palace, and initiated a three-day anti-oppression strike.

In Shanghai, more than ten thousand university students gathered on the evening of the 22nd on the campus of Jiaotong University to commemorate the anniversary of the founding of the All-China Students' Federation. The venue was covered with slogans, banners, and cartoons opposing American imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese aggression threatening China, opposing the Kuomintang's arrest and oppression of students in various places, and protesting the arrest of five Jiaotong University students. One of the cartoons depicted the war criminal MacArthur using bloody hands to help the Japanese army invade China; another depicted the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek, embracing a bag of US dollars, precariously perched on a dragon throne atop a pyramid of skulls. During the meeting, student leaders reported on the great significance of celebrating the first anniversary of the birth of the All-China Students' Federation and read out congratulatory telegrams from student organizations across the country. At the meeting, students collectively shouted anti-oppression slogans and sang heroic songs such as "Oppose America's Support for Japan," which included lines such as "America helps Japan build warships, raising a tiger to harm people." Students distributed leaflets calling for heroic struggle. The venue was tightly controlled by student patrols, and Chiang's secret agents did not dare to disrupt it.

　　给蒋李二贼粉墨登场当头一棒！
  　京沪爱国学生罢课示威
　  金陵中大两千余学生包围蒋党“青年部”
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据各方消息报导：蒋贼介石与李贼宗仁二十日在南京就伪总统与伪副总统的同时，蒋贼心脏地区的宁、沪两地学生，爆发了英勇的爱国民主运动，有力的打击了这幕丑剧。南京大中学生，二十一日晚（前误为二十日晚）在中央大学草坪联合举行“五二○血案周年纪念大会”，纪念一年前南京同学惨遭蒋匪残酷镇压。会上，学生演出窃国大盗袁世凯做皇帝，旋即被全国人民推翻的活报。讵会上预伏之蒋党特务，即撕毁墙上学生所张贴之反压迫、反对国民党出卖华南资源、反对美帝扶植日本等标语口号，并扑灭灯光，捣乱会场秩序。
    散会后，蒋特沿街欧打学生，并在鼓楼等处逮捕金陵、中央两大学学生各二人，押往蒋党特务组织“青年部”。两校学生闻讯后，群情激愤，即于二十一日夜一时许，汇合同学两千余人（据路透社）包围该部，提出立即恢复被捕同学自由，交出行凶主犯，向学生道歉等严正要求；并不顾蒋党警察、卫兵阻挠监视，在该部门墙上以油墨粉笔涂写及高呼“解散特务组织”、“解散青年部”、“打倒特务走狗”、“严惩凶手”等标语口号，并将国民党称为“刮民党”。前后英勇包围蒋党“青年部”达十余小时。在学生强大威力下，蒋党被迫先后将金大、中央四个被捕学生释放。
    学生获得初步胜利后，即于二十二日下午三时离开该部作示威游行，经蒋匪伪国大会堂及伪总统府等处，并举行为期三日的反压迫罢课。
    在上海，各校大中学生万余人，二十二日晚在交通大学校园集会，纪念全国学联成立周年，会场中遍贴反对美帝国主义扶植日本侵略势力复活威胁中国、反对国民党在各地逮捕压迫学生、抗议交大五学生被捕等标语旗帜及漫画。其中一幅描绘着战贩麦克阿瑟以血淋淋的双手，扶助日本军队侵略中国；另一幅则画着人民公敌蒋介石，抱着美元钱袋摇摇欲坠的高踞在用骷髅砌成的金字塔尖端的龙座上。开会时，学生领袖报告庆祝全国学联诞生一周年的重大意义，并宣读各地学生团体贺电。会上，学生集体高呼反压迫口号，并高歌“反对美国扶植日本”等雄壮歌曲。该曲中有“美国帮助日本造军舰，养虎伤人”等词句。学生散发号召英勇斗争的传单，会场由学生严密纠察，蒋匪特务未敢扰乱。
