Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th: A branch reporter summarized the battle in April in which the military and civilians of Central China annihilated more than 5,000 enemy troops, initially defeating the Kuomintang bandit army's "total war." He stated: In our all-out offensive in March, the bandit army suffered heavy casualties. To save their dying fate, they urgently transferred their 25th Division, 63rd Division, 72nd Division, and 83rd Division, four reorganized divisions, from Nanjing, Shanghai, Dabie Mountains, and Shandong to Central China, deploying the so-called "Comprehensive Suppression of Northern Jiangsu," implementing a "total war" of burning all, killing all, looting all, and arresting all. They successively used thirteen regiments to "suppress" the Huainan area, six regiments to "suppress" the Taixing and Taixian areas, five regiments to "suppress" the Ru (Gao) Dong area, and eleven battalions to "suppress" the Nantong and Haimen areas. At the same time, the enemy on the east side of the Grand Canal gathered parts of their 44th Division, 51st Division, and 83rd Division, entrenched in Cheqiao in Huai'an, Anfeng in Baoying, and Taolin in Sheyang, and frequently conducted "mopping-up operations" with forces ranging from one regiment to one brigade. Our military and civilians in various regions, in their heroic anti-"mopping-up" struggle, always maintained the initiative, closely coordinated internal and external lines, and maneuvered to annihilate and capture Chiang bandits. They first annihilated more than 200 bandits on the Taixing port line from the 2nd to the 4th, giving the bandit's "pacification" meeting held in Taixian a head-on blow. On the 6th, the bandits hurriedly dispatched the 90th Brigade of the 4th Reorganized Division, the 108th Brigade of the 25th Division, and other units towards our Xuanjiabao, Dasizhuang, and the coastal area of Taixing in dozens of groups to carry out "mopping-up operations." Our external armed forces immediately launched proactive attacks, annihilating more than 640 bandits in Rugao and Jingjiang, and successively capturing six strongholds including Zhujiadai and Mengshan on the Ji (jia city) Jing (Jiang) line, and three strongholds including Tangba on the Dong (tai) Tai (xian) line. The Jiangfang troops also intercepted three bandit military transport steamships, while the internal armed forces consistently persisted in their original struggle. Suffering from our internal and external attacks, the bandit's four strongholds, including Jingjiang City, fell into complete isolation, and the "mopping-up" was forced to stop on the 16th. Our Nan (tong) and Hai (men) armed forces transferred a part of their forces to the external line, captured Jiangzao Port, forced the retreat of the Sanxutou bandit stronghold, attacked the enemy reinforcing Haimen from Nantong, annihilated one route, and advanced to the foot of Langshan Mountain on the Yangtze River, sweeping away the local Chiang Kai-shek forces within a hundred miles, smashing the "Eight-Faced Great Suppression" by eleven battalions of the bandit police. The military and civilians in Huainan also captured more than ten strongholds, annihilating more than 1,000 bandits, and smashed the bandit's "Great Suppression" by thirteen regiments. The Jiangdu Qintong armed forces powerfully coordinated with the Huai (an) Bao (ying) military and civilians, annihilating more than 500 bandits of the 177th Regiment of the 59th Brigade of the 4th Reorganized Division. Following the victory in Qingyang Town, the military and civilians in Huaibei recovered seven districts in Si (xian) Su (qian) and other counties, pushing the battle line to the suburbs of Si County and Wuhe City, and once stormed into Siyang City on the 10th. The main force of the People's Liberation Army also captured Xiangshuikou and Chenjiagang, important ports and salt distribution centers in northern Jiangsu, at the beginning of the month, annihilating more than 1,000 bandits. Under the powerful blows of our military and civilians, the bandit army was unable to attend to both ends, exhausted, and its morale further declined. The local Chiang Kai-shek forces along the Taixing River were so frightened that they docked their boats in the middle of the river at night to sleep. When the 90th Brigade scurried to Dasizhuang, they built more than 50 bunkers overnight, and as soon as they heard gunfire, they shrank into the bunkers and dared not fight. More than 50 soldiers from the artillery company and transport company of the 109th Brigade deserted, some entire squads were left with only the squad leader. The entire Second Company of the First Battalion of the 45th Regiment of the 15th Brigade of the 72nd Division, 47 soldiers of the recruit company of the 122nd Regiment of the 51st Division, and 26 soldiers of the 123rd Regiment successively killed their company and platoon leaders, totaling 29, and defected to our army with their weapons. The development of the struggle situation in Central China indicates that our entire military and civilians will certainly be able to make persistent efforts, and on the basis of the victory in April, completely smash all the dying struggles of the Kuomintang bandit army.

　　华中军民英勇奋战月余
  　匪“总体战”已被打垮
    【新华社华东二十日电】分社记者综述四月份华中军民歼敌五千余名，初步打垮国民党匪军“总体战”之经过称：在我三月份全面攻势中，匪军迭遭大量歼灭。为挽救其垂死命运，乃急从京、沪、大别山及山东等地抽调其二十五师、六十三师、七十二师、八十三师四个整编师至华中，部署所谓“全面扫荡苏北”，实施烧光、杀光、抢光、抓光的“总体战”，先后以十三个团“扫荡”淮南地区，以六个团“扫荡”泰兴、泰县地区，以五个团“扫荡”如（皋）东地区，以十一个营“扫荡”南通、海门地区。同时运河线东侧之敌则纠集其四十四师、五十一师及八十三师各一部，窜据淮安之车桥、宝应之安丰、射阳之陶林等地，经常以一个团至一个旅兵力进行“清剿”。我各地军民在英勇的反“扫荡”斗争中，始终掌握主动、内外线密切配合，机动歼捕蒋匪，首于二日至四日在泰兴口岸线上歼匪二百余名，予匪在泰县召开之“绥靖”会议当头一棒。六日匪仓惶以整四师之九十旅、二十五师之一○八旅等部向我泰兴宣家堡、大泗庄、口岸沿江地区，分数十股进行“扫荡”。我外线武装即主动出击，在如皋及靖江等地歼匪六百四十余名，连克季（家市）靖（江）线之朱家埭、孟山等六据点及东（台）泰（县）线之唐坝等三据点，江防部队亦截获匪军运汽船三艘，而内线武装则始终坚持原地斗争。匪受我内外夹击，其靖江城等四据点陷入完全孤立，“扫荡”被迫于十六日停止。我南（通）、海（门）武装则以一部转入外线，攻克姜灶港，逼退三圩头匪据点，攻击由南通增援海门之敌，歼其一路，并挺进长江边狼山脚下横扫百余里内之土蒋，粉碎匪交警等部十一个营的“八面大会剿”。淮南军民亦攻克据点十余处，歼匪千余名，粉碎匪十三个团的“大扫荡”。江都溱潼武装有力策应淮（安）宝（应）军民，歼匪整四师五十九旅一七七团五百余名。淮北军民继青阳镇之捷，收复泗（县）宿（迁）等县七个区，将战线推向泗县五河城郊，十日曾一度攻入泗阳城。解放军主力亦于月初攻克苏北重要港口淮盐集散地响水口与陈家港，歼匪千余名。在我军民有力打击下，匪军首尾难顾，疲困不堪，士气更趋颓丧，泰兴沿江土蒋吓得夜间泊船到江心睡觉，九十旅窜抵大泗庄时连夜筑地堡五十多个，一闻枪声即龟缩堡内不敢出战。一○九旅炮兵连、输送连各逃亡五十多名，有的全班只剩下班长光杆。七十二师十五旅四十五团一营二连全部，五十一师一二二团新兵连士兵四十七名及一二三团所属士兵二十六名，则先后击毙其连排长等二十九名携带武器投诚我军。华中斗争形势的发展，预示着我全体军民必能再接再厉，在四月份的胜利基础上，彻底粉碎国民党匪军一切垂死挣扎的阴谋。
