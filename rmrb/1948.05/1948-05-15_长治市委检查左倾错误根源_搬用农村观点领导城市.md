    Changzhi Municipal Party Committee Examines the Roots of Leftist Errors
    Applying Rural Perspectives to Lead the City
    Class Designation Committed a Fundamental Error; Currently Investigating Wrongful Struggles Against Industry and Commerce; Specific Problems Have Been Resolved
    [Taihang News] According to instructions from the Regional Party Committee, the Changzhi Municipal Committee conducted a review at the end of last month regarding the erroneous thinking behind the policy towards industry and commerce in Changzhi, and submitted a written report to the Regional Party Committee. The report stated: The problem of urban industry and commerce policy was not only unresolved during the rectification, but the rural perspective was further intensified. After the rectification, we organized three distribution teams, preparing for a major effort. On March 10th, the Regional Party Committee instructed by telephone: "There is a fundamental error in the class designation in Changzhi. No distribution is allowed within the city." Only then did we halt preparations for distribution within the city and the city gates, and transferred cadres to engage in production. However, at that time, we were not very clear as to why this was being done, and the general cadres were even more resistant. On March 11th, a production conference was held, putting forward the policy of "developing production, organizing industry, handicrafts workshops, street vendors, and all industrial and commercial production"; however, in the organizational line, the rural slogan of "taking the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, and firmly uniting with the middle peasants" was still put forward. In short, during this period, we were basically using rural perspectives, slogans, and policies to do urban work, which was completely wrong. On March 27th, Comrade Wang Deshui conveyed the Regional Party Committee's instructions on urban work. During our discussion, we combined it with a thorough reckoning of the ideas of the poor people turning over, and the struggle against industry and commerce, in terms of both thought and specific policies. We also realized that the slogan of "poor and hired peasants as the backbone, uniting with the middle peasants" was wrong. However, when the "Several Opinions on Production" were published in the Changzhi City Guidance Newspaper, it still dragged the erroneous tail of the rural slogan, which was to "match" all kinds of classes and strata in the city with the rural areas. For example, small handicraft workers and small vendors with relatively little capital must be "matched" with the rural middle peasants. Regarding the Regional Party Committee's instructions to "develop industry and commerce, prosper the city, and rely not only on the workers, but also on the petty bourgeoisie, the free professionals, and the liberal bourgeoisie...", we felt confused because it did not specify who to rely on primarily and who to unite with. We felt that it should be the workers, the poor people, and the handicraft workers as the backbone, uniting with the petty bourgeoisie, the free professionals, and the liberal bourgeoisie, but we were not sure. Therefore, the poor and hired peasant line was negated, but we dared not put forward a new organizational line (only putting forward an empty class line). On April 8th, a city-wide expanded cadre meeting was held to study the urban policy of developing industry and commerce, to review work based on the policy, and to determine the future work direction (see this newspaper on May 5th). However, two points were not raised: one was the issue of the organizational line (because it had not yet been resolved), and the other was the issue of compensation for wrongful struggles against industry and commerce (because it was difficult to cash in, it was temporarily not publicized). On April 19th, after seeing the People's Daily's criticism of Changzhi, we felt that it was very correct. We really wanted to write a review and send it, but we felt that we had basically finished distributing, it was very difficult to return, and we didn't know how to explain it, so we didn't write it. After the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District were published, the wrongful struggles were generally brewing, and many problems were raised. They did not believe in our propaganda about protecting industry and commerce. At this time, we felt that we must resolve the issue of compensation, and decided to select two or three households in each district for typical resolution. On the one hand, we would lead the masses to gain experience in correcting deviations, and on the other hand, we would await specific instructions from the Regional Party Committee. At present, our Municipal Party Committee is still afraid to solve the problem of wrongful struggles on a general and large scale. In addition to typical solutions, we are conducting ideological preparation (emphasizing the study of the Central Bureau's instructions to Taiyue) and practical preparation (investigating the situation of wrongful struggles against industry and commerce). In short, from the rectification to the present, in our thinking, it has been a process of transition from a rural perspective to an urban perspective. Initially, it was completely a rural perspective. Afterwards, the rural perspective was added with some urban perspectives, but it fell into a state of confusion. Finally, the urban perspective took the upper hand (still with remnants of the rural perspective), but there was no determination or method for correcting deviations. From the expanded cadre meeting on April 8th to the present, several specific problems have been resolved (see scattered news in this newspaper). The things frozen by the three districts after the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, and the shares of landlords and rich peasants in mutual aid groups, have also been fully returned.
    Taihang Branch News Agency Note: This review proves that the Changzhi Municipal Party Committee is indeed humbly studying and striving to correct errors, but some problems have not yet been resolved, especially the question of "who to rely on? and who to take as the mainstay?". Regarding this issue, we believe it is as follows: Changzhi is a medium-sized city in the heartland of our liberated area, and bureaucratic capitalism has long ceased to exist. In politics, it should be under the leadership of the proletariat, uniting all working people, such as handicraft workers, urban poor, independent industrialists and merchants, free professionals, as well as the petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie, to realize the politics of New Democracy. In the economy, we must resolutely implement the policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into consideration both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" as instructed by Chairman Mao. Therefore, all industries and businesses of the petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie should be protected and allowed to develop under the aforementioned policy (Mao Zedong: The Present Situation and Our Tasks). "Relying on the poor and hired peasants and uniting with the middle peasants" in the land reform movement refers to the struggle to eliminate feudalism; in developing the agricultural economy, Comrade Ren Bishi said in "Several Issues in Land Reform": "In the development process from the individual economy to the collective cooperative economy in the new democratic economic construction, we mainly rely on the new and old middle peasants." In rural areas, it is often because the distinction between political and economic issues is not clear, so different strata are often treated differently in production. This problem must be resolved regardless of whether it is in the city or in the countryside.

    长治市委检查左倾错误根源
    搬用农村观点领导城市
    划阶级犯了原则错误  现正调查错斗工商业情况  已解决具体问题
    【太行消息】长治市委会根据区党委指示，于上月底检讨对长治市工商业政策的错误思想，并向区党委作出书面汇报。汇报中说：对于城市工商业政策，在整编中不但没得到解决，反而农村观点更加重了。整编后我们组织三个平分队，准备还要大干。三月十日区党委电话指示：“长治市划阶级有原则错误，城内不准平分。”这才停止了城内城关平分的准备工作，抽出干部搞生产。但当时我们对于为什么要这样做是不很明确的，一般干部更是抵抗。三月十一日召开生产会议，提出“发展生产、组织工业、手工业作坊、摊贩及一切工商业生产”的方针；但在组织路线上，仍然提出“以贫雇为骨干，并巩固的联合中农”的农村口号。总之，在这一段，我们基本上是以农村观点、口号、政策，去做城市工作，是完全错误的。三月二十七日，王德水同志传达了区党委对城市工作的指示，我们在讨论中，结合清算了贫民翻身、斗争工商业的思想与具体政策两点。对于“贫雇骨干，团结中农”的口号，亦认识到是错误的。但当在长市导报发表“对生产的几点意见”时，仍然拖着农村口号的错误尾巴，这就是把城市的各种阶级阶层，都要和农村“相当”一下。如对资金较贫的手工业工人、小商贩，一定和农村中农“相当”一下。对于区党委指示“发展工商业，繁荣城市，不但依靠工人，而且要依靠小资产阶级、自由职业者、自由资产阶级……”，没有说明以谁为主，去团结谁，感到迷惑。我们觉得应该是以工人、贫民、手工业工人为骨干，团结小资产阶级、自由职业者、自由资产阶级，但也不敢肯定。因此贫雇路线否定了，新的组织路线却不敢提出（只提了一个空洞的阶级路线）。四月八日召开全市扩干会，学习发展工商业的城市政策，根据政策检查工作，确定今后工作方针（见五月五日本报）。但有两点没有提：一是组织路线问题（因仍未解决），一是错斗工商业赔偿问题（因难于兑现，暂未宣传）。四月十九看到人民日报对长市的批评意见，觉得很对。很想写一篇检讨寄去，但我们觉着基本上分完了，很难退，不知如何说明才好，故未写去。中央局对太岳区指示发表后，斗错的普遍酝酿起来，提出问题很多，对我们保护工商业的宣传不相信。这时，我们感到必须解决赔偿问题，决定每区先选择两三户进行典型解决。一面领导群众取得纠偏经验，一面等待区党委具体指示。现在我们市委思想上还不敢普遍大量解决错斗问题，除典型解决外，进行思想准备（强调学习中央局给太岳指示）和实际准备（调查错斗工商业情况）。总之，从整编到现在，在我们思想上，是从农村观点到城市观点转变的过程。起初完全是农村观点，其后农村观点又加了些城市观点，但却陷入混乱状态，最后城市观点占了优势（仍有农村观点残余），但对纠偏仍无决心，无办法。自四月八日扩干会到现在，已解决了若干具体问题（见本报零星消息），三区在土地法大纲公布后冻结的东西数与互助组中地富股金，也已全部退还。
    太行分社按：这篇检讨，证明长治市委确实在虚心研究，努力改正错误，不过有些问题尚未解决，特别是“依靠谁？以谁为主”的问题。关于这一问题，我们认为是这样：长市是我们解放区腹心地区的中等城市，官僚资本主义早已不存在。在政治上，应该是在无产阶级领导下，团结一切劳动人民，如手工业工人、城市贫民、独立工商业者、自由职业者以及小资产阶级、中等资产阶级，实现新民主主义的政治。在经济上，必须坚决贯彻毛主席所指示的“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的方针。所以，对于小资产阶级、中等资产阶级的一切工商业，都应该予以保护，并使他们在上述方针下得到发展（毛主席：目前形势和我们的任务）。在土改运动中“依靠贫雇，团结中农”，是指消灭封建的斗争而言；在发展农业经济中，任弼时同志在“土地改革中的几个问题”中说：“在新民主主义经济建设中，由个体经济到集体合作经济的发展过程中，主要是依靠新老中农”。在农村中，也往往因为分不清政治问题与经济问题，所以在生产中往往按不同阶层分别待遇。不管在城市与农村，这一问题都必须解决。
