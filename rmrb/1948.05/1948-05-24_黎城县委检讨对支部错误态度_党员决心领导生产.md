　　[Taihang News] After the Li Cheng County Party Committee profoundly reviewed its past leftist errors regarding old foundations, party members and cadres have put down their ideological burdens and are determined to actively lead production. Although the county had undergone several production mobilizations and rectifications, it had only initially resolved erroneous thoughts such as cadres fearing making mistakes, tailism, and one-sided views of the poor and hired peasants, allowing production to begin to improve. According to statistics from 97 villages in the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts, over 70,000 mu have already been sown, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total autumn land. However, party members and cadres in most villages are still uncertain about party rectification. They suspect, "Is it the same as struggling against feudalism?" "Does the Party want us?" "Will old cadres be completely purged in the future?" "Will the masses retaliate?". They are alienated from the Party, feeling that the revolution has turned against them, and are preparing to be struggled against. Good party members and cadres also feel that "commandism is ineffective, and they don't know how to use democratic style," and are hesitant to lead production. In order to implement correction and vigorously promote the production movement, the County Party Committee convened a meeting on the 11th of this month for 486 key cadres, including branch secretaries and village chiefs from the entire county. First, Comrade Liu Jianfu, the county secretary, made a profound review on behalf of the County Party Committee, pointing out that the county made a leftist deviation of "excessively emphasizing the poor and hired peasants" when it convened a meeting of poor and hired peasant representatives last winter to promote winter production. The county and district cadres who returned from reorganization were mainly concentrated in 20 land reform base villages, relaxing leadership over 150 production villages and failing to "greet" village cadres in time, for which the County Party Committee should be responsible. At the same time, due to the narrow views of the poor and hired peasants held by some leading cadres, they kicked away the old foundations indiscriminately, dampening the enthusiasm of comrades, which was completely wrong. For example, some party members and cadres in the Sixth District went with enthusiasm to ask how to lead and check themselves in the future, but the district cadres replied: "You have eaten some millet from the masses for nothing, and I won't talk to you in detail. Reflect on it!" As a result, comrades were alienated from the leadership and even collapsed. In the future, we must absolutely rely on the branches and help comrades correct their mistakes in the spirit of curing diseases and saving people. In the future, during party rectification, we must distinguish between the size of the mistakes, whether they were for public or private benefit; retaliation, binding, and hanging and beating are absolutely not allowed; those backward party members who do not work should also be rectified. The County Party Committee also commended Comrade Yang Fengqi, a good party member who actively led production, and strictly criticized the leftist errors such as beating the branch secretary and intimidating party members in the party rectification in Hengjing Village and scaring party members in Beisanglu. The party members and cadres present all felt "as if they had taken good medicine, and now they can breathe easily." Then, the County Party Committee allowed everyone to speak freely. Some party members raised: "The superiors let us do it, and then criticize us when we make mistakes" (such as the "poor and hired peasant line" last winter). Some said they were attacked by the "Poor Peasants Association" and were uncertain about party rectification. After pouring out their hearts, everyone naturally and quickly turned to reviewing themselves, putting down their burdens, and expressing their determination to learn the democratic style, lead production well, and correct deviations. The village chief of Xing Shutan said: "The superiors have reviewed their mistakes and are going to correct them, but our village cadres also have great shortcomings. For example, this year we are just afraid of making mistakes and push everything to the poor and hired peasants, and we are not responsible, which is completely our mistake!" The branch secretary of Renzhuang said: "We have been working for eight or nine years and still make mistakes. Can the Poor Peasants Association not make mistakes? Moreover, most of them are honest people, with only a few hooligans. We should go back and dissolve it with an attitude of education and persuasion, and we must never retaliate again." After three days of discussion and criticism, the mood has turned around. Finally, everyone decided to go back and tell all party members about the content of the meeting, so that everyone can lead the masses to do a good job in production.

　　黎城县委检讨对支部错误态度
  　党员决心领导生产
    【太行消息】黎城县委深刻检讨了过去对老基础的左倾错误后，党员干部放下思想包袱，决心积极领导生产。该县过去虽经数次生产动员与整顿，仅仅初步解决了一些干部怕犯错误、尾巴主义及片面贫雇观点等错误思想，使生产开始有了起色；据二、三、四、五区九十七个村统计，已下种七万多亩，占秋地总数三分之二强。但是，大部村庄的党员干部还对整党不摸底，他们怀疑“是否和斗封建一样？”“党是否要自己？”“旧干部将来是否一律清洗？”“群众是否会报复？”。对党离心，认为革命革到了自己头上，准备挨斗。好党员干部亦感到命令作风使不上，民主作风不会用”，对领导生产束手束脚。县委为了贯彻纠偏，有力开展生产运动，特于本月十一日召集全县支书、村长等四百八十六个主要干部开会。首先由县书刘健夫同志代表县委会作了深刻检讨，指出：去冬县里召开贫雇代表会，推动冬季生产，犯了“过分强调贫雇”的左倾偏向。整编回来的县区干部，主要又集中在廿个土改基点村，放松对一百五十个生产村的领导，对村干部没及时“招呼”，这应由县委负责。同时，由于一部分领导干部存在着狭隘的贫雇观点，对老基础不分好坏，一脚踢开，把同志们的热情打下去，这是完全错误的。比如六区有些党员干部抱着满腔热情去问，今后如何领导与检查自己，区干部回答说：“你们白吃了群众一些小米，我就不和你们细谈，好好检讨吧！”结果使同志们对领导上离心，直至躺倒。今后绝对要依靠支部，本着治病救人的精神，帮助同志们改正错误；将来在整党中，一定要分清错误大小，为公为私；绝不准报复、捆打吊罚；对那些不做工作的落后党员，亦要加以整顿。县委又表扬了积极领导生产的好党员杨逢奇同志，同时严格批判了横井村整党中打支书，北桑鲁吓唬党员等左倾错误。到会的党员干部都感觉“好比吃了一付好药，这可出上气来啦。”接着，县委让大家自由发言。有些党员提出：“上级让咱干，错了又来批评”（如去冬的“贫雇路线”等）。有的说受了“贫农团”打击，对整党又摸不着底。经过倾吐心底话，大家很自然的迅速转入检讨自己，放下包袱，表明学习民主作风，好好领导生产、纠正偏向的决心。杏树滩村长说：“上级有错误都检讨了，并要纠正，可是咱村干部也有很大缺点。就比如咱今年光怕犯错，啥事也推给贫雇，自己不负责任，害了贫雇，这完全是咱的错误呀！”任庄支书说：“咱干了八、九年啦还犯错，贫农团还能不犯错？况且里面大都是老实人，只有几个流氓分子，咱回去应以教育说服态度来解散，决不能再来一个报复。”经过三天讨论批判，情绪都转过来啦。最后大家决定回去后要把开会内容告给全体党员，让大家带领群众搞好生产。
