　　Yangcheng County Party Committee Reviews Mistakes
  　Personally Goes to the Countryside to Implement Corrections
    Farmers Say, "Chairman Mao's Policies Have Finally Reached Our Village!"
    Harming Middle Peasants Unacceptable to Poor Peasants
    Resettlement of Landlords and Rich Peasants Should Be Handled Simultaneously with Compensation for Middle Peasant Losses
    [Taiyue News] In the latter half of April, Yangcheng convened a meeting of district cadres to review the implementation of correcting "leftist" deviations as proposed at the Yue Zhuang meeting last time (end of March). In the past half-month, the phenomenon of infringing upon middle peasants has begun to be corrected. In villages visited by county and district cadres, the doors of middle peasants that had been sealed were generally opened, and controls were generally lifted. Property seized from middle peasants in the past has generally been returned if the original items are still available. As a result, the panic among middle peasants has begun to dissipate, and the mood of the masses has begun to stabilize. For example, Xiao Gang, a middle peasant in Nanyu, said, "Today, after the door was opened, everything suddenly feels different. I'm as happy as a child celebrating the New Year." Li Chun, a wealthy middle peasant in Xiling, said, "Today my heart is clear, and I don't know where the strength in my arms came from. One day of work feels like two. Chairman Mao's policies have finally reached our village." It is especially worth noting that not only middle peasants are happy, but also truly honest poor peasants are equally satisfied. Pei Junping, a poor peasant in Xiling, said, "I never agreed with harming middle peasants." Some poor peasants, after understanding the explanation, said, "In the past six months, we haven't become poor hired laborers but lonely paupers. No one in the village listens to us." Their general understanding of middle peasants is: "They are also laborers. Why should we struggle against them? We didn't agree with sealing their doors last year." As ideological concerns began to break down, everyone's enthusiasm for production immediately increased. According to recent news, valleys have generally been planted. Some had casually planted before applying fertilizer, and now they are trying to remedy it. After planting millet, many people immediately engaged in transportation, and some have already made two trips to Yicheng. According to a blacksmith selling farm tools, he only sold over 10,000 yuan at fairs in Zhangzhuang and Shanye after Qingming, but recently he sold 140,000 yuan at a fair in Tiantan Mountain. The masses are buying farm tools and livestock, wanting to make a good effort to make up for previous losses. However, the review also revealed another bad phenomenon: some county and district cadres, especially many village cadres, are not resolute in correcting deviations, secretly discounting or even resisting them. A relatively common problem is fear of "losing face," only opening doors for middle peasants but not explaining the reasons or admitting mistakes. Some even pick on small faults of middle peasants when opening the doors, wanting the middle peasants to be "grateful." Some even dare to threaten middle peasants, saying, "Don't stick your tail up (meaning raising your head), you can hide on the first day, but you can't hide on the fifteenth." Some village cadres and heads of poor peasant associations openly resist, saying, "I'd rather die than retreat." Some district and village cadres, even during the inspection and discussion, still believe, "There is no infringement on middle peasants in our district," "No compensation now, we'll talk about it in the fall," "Not correcting it won't have a big impact on production, what's the fear of correcting it a little slower?" Some blame their superiors, saying, "You told us to do it this way, and now you want us to correct it." Some believe, "How can we satisfy the demands of poor peasants and hired laborers by doing this?" As for the resettlement of landlords and rich peasants who were swept out the door and the cancellation of controls, little action has been taken. The county party committee criticized these errors in its summary: Some people doubt whether giving landlords the same share is capitulationism, always fearing that resettling landlords who were swept out the door will "lose our stand," but they do not know that this is only harmful to the peasants. "Left" is no better than right. It proposed that controls on landlords should be lifted, doors that were sealed should be opened, and those landlords and rich peasants who were swept out the door and have nothing to eat should be given some things to ensure that no one starves to death, and this work should be done simultaneously with compensating middle peasant losses. Finally, it pointed out that the county party committee is responsible for the errors of infringing upon middle peasants since last autumn and winter, because the county party committee's November meeting itself was flawed. Comrades must have the courage to admit and correct mistakes once they have made them, with each level admitting errors to the level above, and should not blame each other or shirk responsibility. At the same time, everyone should understand that only by humbly and frankly admitting mistakes and correcting them in action can losses be compensated. Nor should we assume that we can avoid making mistakes in our work. Comrades must not be afraid to work boldly and take responsibility in the future just because they have made mistakes in the past. They must take the spirit of being a long-term worker for the people and do their work actively and responsibly. Because it is very difficult to correct the "leftist" deviation of reckless action, the approach this time is to first establish key points to create experience and promote general villages. Now the county party committee has selected Liangcheng as a key point, and each district has also selected key points. The comrades of the county party committee went to the countryside the day before yesterday, and the work of the key points will be opened up immediately.

### 阳城县委检讨错误　亲自下乡贯彻纠偏  农民说：“毛主席政策可到咱村了。”

　　阳城县委检讨错误
  　亲自下乡贯彻纠偏
    农民说：“毛主席政策可到咱村了。”
    伤害中农贫农不同意
    安置地主富农应和补偿中农损失同时处理
    【太岳消息】四月下半月，阳城召集区干部开会，检查上次（三月底）岳庄会议提出的纠正左倾偏向情况。半月来，侵害中农现象已开始得到纠正，凡是县区干部到过的村庄，中农被封的门一般都开了，管制一般都取消了，过去侵犯中农的财物，原物还在的一般都退回了。因之中农的恐慌开始解除，群众情绪开始安定。如南峪中农小缸说：“今天开了门忽然不一样了，我象小娃过年一样的高兴。”西岭富裕中农李春说：“今天心清了，胳膀的劲不知从那里就来了。一天生活就顶两天，毛主席的政策可到咱村了。”特别值得注意的是不只中农高兴，就是真正老实的雇贫农也一样满意。西岭贫农裴君平说：“犯中农我原来就不同意。”有的贫农经过解释明白了说：“半年来咱不是雇贫变成孤贫了，村子里谁也不听咱的话。”他们一般对中农的认识是：“人家也是劳动人，为什么要斗人家？封人家的门，我们去年就不同意。”随着思想顾虑的开始打破，大家的生产劲头马上提高，根据最近的消息，谷地一般都种上了，有的以前没上粪就马虎种上了，现在正在想法补救。许多人种上谷子后，马上搞运输，有人已去翼城跑了两趟。据一个卖农具的铁匠说，他清明以后在张庄和山野赶会，都只卖下一万多元，最近去天坛山赶会，一次就卖了十四万。群众正在买农具买牲口，要好好的闹一下来补足以前的损失。可是从检讨中也发现另外一种坏的现象，就是有些县区干部，特别是很多村干部，对纠偏不坚决，在下面偷偷摸摸的打折扣甚至反抗。比较普遍的是怕“丢人”，只给中农开门，但不说明原因，不承认错误。有的甚至在开门时挑中农的一些小毛病，要中农“领情”；有的竟敢威胁中农说：“不要撅尾巴（抬头的意思）躲得了初一，躲不了十五。”有的村干部和贫雇的负责人公开反抗说：“死也不往回退。”有的区村干部，直到检查讨论中还认为：“我区侵犯中农没有什么”“现在不赔偿，秋后再说吧。”“不纠正对生产影响不大，慢一点纠正怕什”。有的则埋怨上级说：“你们让我们这样干，现在又要纠正。”有的则认为：“这样搞还能满足贫雇农要求吗？”至于对扫地出门的地主富农的安置取消管制等等，多没有动手作。县委在总结时对这些错误作了批判：有些人怀疑给地主同样一份是不是投降主义，总怕安置了扫地出门的地主会“失掉立场”，却不知道这样对农民也只有害处，“左”并不比右好。他提出地主被管制的要取消管制，封门的要开门，对扫地出门的地富眼下没吃喝的，要分给一些东西，保证不饿死一个人，并且这个工作要和补偿中农损失同时来作。最后指出去年秋冬以来侵犯中农等错误，县委是要负责的，因为县委十一月会议即有错误，同志们已经错了即要有勇气认错改错，一级向一级认错，不应互相埋怨或互相推诿责任。同时大家应了解犯了错只有虚心坦白承认错并在行动中改错，才能补偿损失。也不应设想工作中就可不犯错误。同志们一定不要因过去有错，今后就不敢大胆工作大胆负责，要拿出为人民当长工的精神，积极负责的把工作做好。因为纠正左倾瞎干的偏向很难办，这次作法是先搞基点创造经验推动一般村庄。现在县委会已选择梁城为基点，各区也选有基点，县委同志已在前天分别下乡，基点工作马上就可搞开。
