Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 11th: The Jin-Sui Border Region Production Conference concluded in mid-April. Following Commander He Long's instruction to "conscientiously review policies and develop production," the conference conducted detailed discussions on issues such as developing production, disaster relief, and industry and commerce. In his summary report, Administrative Director Wu Xinyu pointed out that the implementation of restoring and developing production last year achieved great results. At the same time, the financial and economic departments carried out anti-corruption and anti-waste campaigns, purified the organization, and investigated internal and external economic counter-revolutionaries, thereby better protecting finance and trade and ensuring supplies to the front lines. However, there were still serious shortcomings and errors in the work, and production leadership was generally relaxed in the second half of last year. In terms of industry and commerce, the normal transformation of landlords and rich peasants in rent reduction and interest reduction was denied, and the heavy collection of business taxes and lack of attention to supporting the transport and sale of local products occurred. The reason for this was the failure to make developing production the center of all financial and economic work, so that finance, trade, and taxation were not well utilized to serve production.

Director Wu then analyzed the different circumstances and conditions of this year's production compared to the past. He said that in the old and semi-old liberated areas, poor peasants who had received land, livestock, and other means of production during land reform were highly motivated to produce, becoming the main force in large-scale production. After correcting the deviation of infringing on the interests of middle peasants in various places, the middle peasants also actively engaged in production. In addition, we encouraged and urged rich peasants and landlords to engage in production, thus increasing the strength of the production front. Therefore, Director Wu proposed that this year's production policy should prioritize agriculture, ensure that no land is left uncultivated, practice intensive farming, and produce more grain. Governments at all levels and financial and trade institutions must conscientiously solve the various difficulties faced by the masses in production, restore rural lending, vigorously develop various sideline industries, and implement production incentive policies. Model laborers should be selected at the village level, and the past phenomena of only praising model laborers without criticism and exaggerating false achievements should be overcome. Targeted education and transformation of loafers should be carried out, and mass public opinion should be mobilized for supervision. In the transformation of labor and mutual assistance, formalism and coercive orders should be overcome, and active elements emerging from the land reform should be relied upon as the backbone to organize and lead through the Poor Peasants League and peasant representative conferences. In terms of industry and mining, the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital should be implemented, with banks and trade institutions providing capital, supplying raw materials, promoting sales of finished products, and safeguarding the legitimate profits of operators.

Finally, in terms of organizational leadership, Director Wu believed that the district and village peasant representative conferences and county peasant associations should become organizations for leading agricultural production, overcoming the idea of cadres who think that peasants will produce on their own after land reform and relaxing leadership, and the idea of neglecting production under the pretext of being busy supporting the front. At the same time, the main force of governments at all levels should also be used to organize and lead the masses in production, and the quality of production work should be the measure for checking the work of the government.

    认真检讨政策，发展生产
    晋绥生产会议闭幕
    【新华社晋绥十一日电】晋绥边区生产会议已于四月中旬闭幕。会议根据贺龙司令员“认真检讨政策，发展生产”的指示，对发展生产、救灾、工矿商业等问题均作了详细研讨。行署主任武新宇于总结报告中指出，去年实行恢复与发展生产，获得很大成绩，同时财经部门进行了反贪污浪费、纯洁组织、清查内外经济反革命，因而更好的保护了金融贸易，保证了前线的供给。但工作中还存在着严重的缺点和错误，去年下半年普遍放松了生产领导。工商业方面，否认地主富农在减租减息中的正常转化，和重征营业税，对土产品扶植运销不注意。其原因是未把发展生产作为一切财经工作的中心，使金融贸易税收未很好为生产服务。接着武主任分析了今年生产与过去不同情况与条件，他说在老区半老区贫苦农民在土改中分到土地、牲畜，及其他生产资料，生产情绪很高，成为大生产的主力军。各地于纠正侵犯中农利益偏向后，中农也积极进行生产，加以我们鼓励与督促富农地主进行生产，生产战线力量因而增大。因之，武主任提出今年生产方针以农业第一，保证不荒地，细作务，多打粮。各级政府与金融贸易机关，则须认真解决群众在生产中的各种困难，恢复农村借贷，大力发展各种副业，并实行奖励生产政策，以村为单位选拔劳模，并克服过去对劳模只表扬不批评，夸大假造成绩的现象，对二流子要有目标的教育改造，发动群众舆论监督。变工互助要克服形式主义，与强迫命令作风，依靠土改中涌现的积极分子为骨干，通过贫农团、农代会去组织领导。在工矿业方面，应贯彻发展生产，劳资两利方针，银行贸易机关贷给资本，供给原料，推销成品，维护经营者的正当利润。最后在组织领导上，武主任认为应使区村农代会及县农会成为领导农业生产的组织，克服干部认为土改后农民自己会生产而放松领导，和借口支前繁忙而忽视生产的思想。同时各级政权主要力量亦应用在组织领导群众生产，生产工作的好坏应为检查政府工作的尺度。
