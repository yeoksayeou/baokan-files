　　In-depth Investigation and Democratic Appraisal
  　Li Gancheng Village Solves Farming Difficulties with Loans
    [News from Ji-Lu-Yu Region] Li Gancheng Village, Shanghe County, First District, has 123 households, including 45 poor peasant households, 18 middle peasant households, and 60 new middle peasant households. Because it is a poor village, 100 mu of land were transferred to the village from other villages during the land reform last year, currently averaging 3.13 mu of land per person. Last autumn, out of a total of 1,950 mu of land in the village, over 1,200 mu were flooded, resulting in a poor autumn harvest. Most households maintained their livelihood by borrowing grain to grind flour and sell zongzi (sticky rice dumplings), sell liangfen (mung bean jelly), and produce small amounts of salt. Before the New Year loan distribution, due to a one-sided pro-poor and pro-hired peasant viewpoint, loans were not granted to middle peasants, causing public dissatisfaction. This time, before the spring plowing loans were distributed, a meeting was first held to call on people to overcome the spring famine through production and frugality. The next day, individual visits were made to impoverished households. During these visits, several honest and reliable activists were discovered. Each of them then contacted some impoverished households. We then convened a meeting of all households preparing to apply for loans, with over 50 people attending. At the meeting, it was explained that the purpose of the loans was to assist poor households with production. Each person declared the amount of the loan they needed and what they would use it for. Groups then discussed and considered which households should and should not receive loans, and whether any poor households had been missed. The masses elected six appraisal committee members, and we also appointed two good village cadres to participate, forming an appraisal committee. The first appraisal did not remove any households and even added several. In the second appraisal, because the funds were limited, it was necessary to solve the difficulties of poor households, and everyone felt embarrassed because it was difficult to eliminate anyone. For example, Yang Feipeng, the chairman of the peasant association, said: "There is little money but many families need it. Reduce the amount of the loans based on what the masses reported. Reduce those who reported more, and reduce those who reported less. Reduce a little for everyone." The appraisal committee members all agreed, but we felt that this was not right, so we explained the spirit of the loan again. The main purpose was to solve the production difficulties of poor households, and it could not be based on an average. Everyone should compare the lives of different households, compare their difficulties, and compare their frugality versus wastefulness. After everyone understood the spirit of the loan, they began the appraisal. As a result of the appraisal, six households that should not have used the funds were eliminated, and the loans of 43 households were reduced. To ensure fairness and reasonableness and fully promote democracy, another mass meeting was held. At the meeting, the names of the households receiving loans and those receiving relief grain were read out, and everyone was asked to break into groups to discuss. During the discussion, it was discovered that village cadre Li Shanqing was raising livestock and did not have labor difficulties, but was also using 20 jin of relief grain. The masses suggested reducing his portion, and another household, the Zong Li family, was added, receiving 20 jin of relief grain. After the discussion, no one had any objections, and the funds were immediately distributed to the masses. A total of 69 households received loans (22 poor peasant households, 45 new middle peasant households, and 2 old middle peasant households), totaling 576,000 yuan. 18 households received relief grain (12 poor peasant households and 6 middle peasant households), totaling 480 jin of grain, with a maximum of 30 jin per household and a minimum of 20 jin. The masses used the loans to mostly buy mung beans and sorghum, grind them into flour, or sell zongzi. The masses said, "It's almost the lean season, and there's no way to farm. This is great."

　　深入调查民主评议
  　李干城村贷款解决种地困难
    【冀鲁豫消息】尚和县一区李干城村，一百廿三户，贫农四十五户，中农十八户，新中农六十户，因是个穷村，去年土改时从外村调剂到该村地一百亩，现每人平均地三亩一分三。去年秋天这村共有地一千九百五十亩，就被淹去一千二百来亩，秋粮歉收，大部分户以揭借粮食磨粉卖粽子、卖凉粉、做小盐维持生活。年前贷款时，由于片面贫雇观点，不贷给中农，群众不满。这次春耕贷款，先开了会，号召生产节约渡过春荒，第二天就个别访问穷苦户。在访问中发现了老实可靠的积极分子数人，他们每人又串通了些贫苦户，我们就召集所有准备贷款的户开会，共到会五十多人，会上说明贷款是扶助穷户生产，会议上每人自报贷款数目及干啥用，又分组酝酿讨论哪户该用不该用，是否还有穷户漏下，群众选出了六个评议委员，我们又指定了两个好的村干参加，组织成评议委员会，头次评议未去掉户还添了几户，二次评议因款少必须解决穷户困难，大家都感觉作难，去掉谁也不好看。如农会主任杨非朋说：“款少使家多，按群众报的款减肥，多报的多去，少报的少去，大家都去点”。评议委员都同意，我们看着不对头，就又给他们解释贷款精神，主要是解决穷户生产困难，不能平均而论，大家要把户与户的生活比一比，比比困难、比比节约与浪费。大家将贷款精神了解后，就开始评议，评议结果，减掉六户不该用款的，减款的四十三户。为了公平合理，充分发扬民主，又召开了一个群众会，在大会上将贷款的和用救济粮的户都念了，叫大家拉开组讨论，在讨论中发现村干李善庆喂着牲口，有劳力不困难，还用救济粮二十斤，群众提意减掉，又添了宗李氏一户，吃救济粮二十斤。讨论结束后都没意见，就立时将款发给群众，共贷了六十九户（贫农二十二户，新中农四十五户，老中农二户）款五十七万六千元。用救济粮的十八户（贫农十二户，中农六户）共用粮四百八十斤，每户最多者三十斤，最少者二十斤。群众贷了款，大部分买成绿豆高粱，磨粉或卖粽子，群众说：“眼看青黄不接，种地没法，这又好啦。”
