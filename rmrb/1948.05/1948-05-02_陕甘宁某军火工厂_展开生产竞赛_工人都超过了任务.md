Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th: A certain military factory of the Industry Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin Sui Joint Defense Region has victoriously exceeded the March production task in the spring production competition, with finished products exceeding February by 20%. Workers Zhang Mingsheng and five others have all created new output records. Each person increased the average amount from February by 50% to 150%. Ironworker Liang Jianzhang used the time for burning materials to help others repair vehicles. Tool fitter Li Guitian devised ways to improve tools, doubling the output and halving the number of defective products. Although the number of inspection team members was reduced by one-third, they exceeded their task by one-third in the competition. Female worker Lei Kelin did not rest even during her menstrual period, inspecting her own copper work and helping to check and issue materials. As of the first half of April, some of the factory's finished products had completed 78% of the entire April plan, an increase of 25% compared to March. Some work even exceeded the entire month's plan by 8%, an increase of 34% compared to March. Currently, the competition among various sections of the factory is continuing to expand.
