To the Editor:

Your newspaper published on April 20th, on page one, the joint order of the Border Region Government and the Military Region - Clause 1, point 4 of Restrictions on the use of Civilian Labor during Spring Plowing clearly stipulates: "Except for necessary substitute farming for military and martyr families and labor exchange farming for the land of militiamen and laborers participating in the war, all village errands, such as: guarding rear stations, sentry duty, looking after cases, sending letters, errands, odd jobs, substitute farming for political and civilian village cadres, repairing houses for military families, carrying water, collecting firewood... etc., must be absolutely prohibited." At the same time, the joint circular No. 47 issued by the Taihang Administrative Office and the Military Region on April 25th also has the same clear stipulation in Clause 1, point 4 as above. However, in the "Decision on Substitute Farming for Military Families" instruction issued by the Wu'an Ninth District Office to various villages on the 20th, the third paragraph of the third question (preferential treatment for retired soldiers) stipulates: "Political and civilian personnel can also let the village farmers' association discuss and give appropriate help in substitute farming in terms of labor, but it must be lower than that of military families. For example, if a military family gets six mu of land substitute farmed by one laborer, cadres can get four mu of land substitute farmed..." According to a certain comrade of the district cadre, the district office's instruction is based on the county government's instruction. Obviously, their instruction is inconsistent with the spirit of the joint order of the Border Region Government and the Military Region. The Border Region order clearly stipulates that no substitute farming should be given to political and civilian cadres, but Wu'an wants to give it, which confuses me. Can the county and district party committees or governments arbitrarily "maneuver" and "revise" the policies and laws of the higher authorities? On what basis was the Wu'an County instruction decided? Does Wu'an County have any special circumstances that allow it to use "flexibility" to revise the policies and laws of the higher authorities? Is this instruction from the district level or the county level? I hope the responsible comrades in Wu'an will check these questions and look forward to a reply.

Finally, I also have a feeling that the policies and laws of the higher authorities were originally very correct and beneficial to the masses, but in the implementation in some places, there are all kinds of malpractices, causing great confusion and opposition from the masses. Tracing the reasons, the main reason is that some county and district cadres emphasize "special circumstances" and "flexibility", do not proceed from the interests of the masses, get carried away, and arbitrarily tamper with policies and laws. What is even worse is that they put the policies and laws of the higher authorities behind them and come up with their own ideas, trying to be different and creating a new set of things, which is a concrete manifestation of irresponsibility to the revolution and the people, engaging in independence and liberalism. These extremely bad styles have caused so much damage to the revolution and the people, which is a crime! Now that party rectification, democracy, replenishment, and large-scale production movements are being carried out everywhere, some local cadres should absolutely not be allowed to repeat the mistakes of the past, causing some unnecessary losses to the revolutionary work.

I hope you will correct me if my understanding is correct. (Han Xingde)

(The questions raised by Comrade Han Xingde are worthy of attention in various places. Failure to act in accordance with policies and laws may have some one-sided reasons at the time, but it will inevitably cause bad results, or today there is one instruction and tomorrow there will be another change, making it impossible for the masses to understand the policies of our party. The Wu'an County Government and the Ninth District Office should be responsible for checking and answering the questions raised by Han Xingde. – Editor)

### 武安九区代耕决定是根据什么规定的？  希武安县府与九区答复

　　武安九区代耕决定是根据什么规定的？
    希武安县府与九区答复编辑同志：
    贵报四月二十日，一版刊载边府、军区联合命令——春耕期间限制动用民力之第一条第四点即明确规定：“除为军烈属必要之代耕及参战的民兵民工之土地变工耕种外，一切村杂差，如：后方站岗、放哨、看案、送信、听差、打杂、给政民村干代耕，给军属修盖房屋、担水、打柴……等，均须绝对禁止”。同时太行行署、军区四月二十五日所颁发之行联字第四七号联合通令中第一条第四点也如上述有明确的规定。但最近武安九区公所二十日发给各村“有关军属代耕决定”之指示中，第三个问题（荣退军人的优待问题）第三段却规定：“政民人员亦可让村农会讨论，在劳力上予以适当帮助代耕，但须低于军属，如军属一个劳力代耕六亩，干属可代耕四亩………”。据区干部某同志说，区公所指示是根据县政府指示下的。很显然的，他们的指示与边府、军区等联合命令之精神是不一致的，边府命令中明文规定不给政民干部代耕，而武安却要让给代耕，这问题使我很糊涂，是不是上级的政策、法令，县区党委或政府可以擅自“机动”“修改”呢？武安县指示是根据什么而决定的呢？武安县是否有什么特殊情况可以运用“灵活性”而修改上级之政策法令呢？这个指示究竟是区上下的呢？还是县里下的？这些问题我希望武安负责同志予以检查并盼答复。
    最后，我还有一点感觉，过去上级的政策与法令本来是十分正确，对群众是有利的，但在某些地方执行的结果，却弊病百出，搞得十分混乱，遭到群众反对。追其原因，主要的就是由于某些县区干部强调“特殊情况”，强调“灵活性”不从群众利益出发，脑子一热，擅自篡改政策法令。更恶劣的是把上级政策法令置诸脑后而别出心裁，标新立异，另来一套，这完全是对革命对人民不负责任、闹独立性、闹自由主义的具体表现。这些极端恶劣的作风，不知使革命使人民遭受到多大损害，这是罪恶！现在各地正在进行整党、民主、抽补与大生产运动，绝对不能允许某些地方某些干部重复过去之错误，致使革命工作遭受到一些不应有的损失。
    我的认识是否正确，还希指正。（韩星德）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （韩星德同志提出的问题是值得各地注意的，不按政策法令办事，在当时或许有某些片面理由，但势必造成恶果，或者今天一个指示明天又来一次更改变动，使群众对我党政策摸不着头脑。武安县政府与九区区公所对韩星德所提问题应负责检查答复。——编者）
