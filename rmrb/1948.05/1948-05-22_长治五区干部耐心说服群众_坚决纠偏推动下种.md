Changzhi News: The spring plowing and sowing in Changzhi's Fifth District were carried out in conjunction with rectifying deviations. Last year, this district severely damaged the interests of middle peasants. In Qujiashan and three other villages, a total of 47 middle peasant households were infringed upon, and through disguised struggles, 131 *shi* of millet, one head of livestock, 64 *mu* of land, and 17 rooms were seized. Since the start of work, 132 middle and poor peasant households have been wrongly struggled against in the entire district (excluding the villages where land was filled). After the cadres' self-criticism, they unanimously agreed that everything should be subordinate to production. The specific methods are: First, explain the policies clearly, make the cadres realize the deviations, and clarify the reasons for uniting with the middle peasants by comparing the current number of middle and poor peasants, so that the village cadres consciously unite with the middle peasants. Second, cadres go deep into the mutual aid teams, hold small forums for middle and poor peasants, and patiently persuade the masses by utilizing meal times and in the fields. After sufficient preparation, a mass meeting is held, and both the wronged households and those who wronged them have heart-to-heart talks to reconcile their relationship. First, restore civil rights, remove the title of "struggle target," and take off the label of "special agent." Compensation is made based on the circumstances. Undistributed property is returned, and for property already distributed, the actual difficulties are taken care of first, and it is explained that the remaining losses will be compensated during land redistribution. The whole district has temporarily compensated 48.6 *shi* of grain, 39 *mu* of land, 11 rooms, and 50,000 yuan. The labels of "special agent" were removed from 21 people. Sixty-two landlord and rich peasant households were settled, and 71 *mu* of land and 10 *shi* of grain were borrowed. According to statistics from four villages, 8 *shi* of seeds were lent out, and two coal kilns were returned to two middle and poor peasant households. The production enthusiasm of all classes in the district is gradually rising. For example, Meng Panghai, a middle peasant who was wrongly struggled against in Nansong, said: "I never dreamed that I would have this day! I will produce well from now on." Zhang Dongsheng, a middle peasant wrongly struggled against in Loudi, bought a mule and is very energetic in production. He told the masses: "As long as I am not struggled against, I will definitely produce well from now on." After sowing, transportation is being prepared. From the fifth day of the third lunar month to the end of the month, more than 50,000 *mu* of autumn land out of the total of more than 60,000 *mu* in the whole district have been sown. The sowing can be completed by the seventh day of the fourth lunar month.

In order to ensure that not a single *mu* of land is left uncultivated in the entire district, the district has planned to organize a spring plowing and sowing inspection team, divided into four groups to inspect each village. If uncultivated land is found, the original owner will be allowed to cultivate it. If it is public land, it will be temporarily lent to households with little or no land for cultivation. Five villages such as Taiyizhang have now shifted from sowing to sideline production, such as transporting sulfur.

　　长治五区干部耐心说服群众
  　坚决纠偏推动下种
    【长治消息】长治五区春耕下种是与纠偏结合进行的。这区去年损害中农利益很严重。屈家山等四个村，共侵犯中农四十七户，变相斗出小米一三一石，牲口一头，地六十四亩，房十七间。自开展工作以来，全区错斗中贫农一三二户（填补村不在内）。经干部检讨后，一致认为一切应服从生产。具体做法是：首先讲明政策，使干部认识偏向，拿上现在中、贫农数量对比，说清团结中农的道理，使村干自觉的团结中农。其次是干部深入互助组，开小型中贫农座谈会，利用饭市和地里，耐心说服群众。酝酿成熟后，经群众大会与错斗户双方谈心，融洽关系，首先恢复公民权，取消斗争对象名称，摘掉特务帽子。根据情况进行补偿。财物未分配的原物归还，已分配的，先按实际困难加以照顾，说明其余损失等填补时补偿。全区暂补粮四十八石六，地三十九亩，房十一间，款五万元，摘掉特务帽子二十一人。安置地主富农六十二户，借地七十一亩，粮食十石。据四个村统计，借出种子八石，给两户中贫农退回煤窑两座。全区各阶层生产情绪逐渐高涨。如南宋错斗中农孟胖孩说：“没梦见咱还有这一天哩！今后好好生产吧。”楼底错斗中农张冬生，买骡子一头，生产非常有劲。并向群众说：“只要不斗我，我今后一定好好生产。”下种后正准备运输。从阴历三月初五到月底，全区秋地六万多亩，已下种五万多亩。阴历四月初七可全部完成下种。
    为做到全区不荒一亩地，区里已计划组织春耕下种检查队，分四个组到各村检查。如发现荒地，有原主的让原主种上，如是公地，借给无地少地户暂种。太义掌等五村现已由下种转入副业生产，如运输硫磺等。（振华、禄田、春喜）
