Neiqiu News: In Nanguan, Neiqiu City, the Poor Peasant League consists of thirteen people, including three cadres. Branch Secretary Lü Xiaosan and Farmers' Association Chairman Li Dapian, both of whom have turned over, also participated. Guo Xilai, the director of the Poor Peasant League, under their control, has consistently infringed upon the interests of middle peasants. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, they secretly classified nine middle peasant households as rich peasants. According to the village cadres, they only did this when the Public Security Bureau asked them for a registration form of class status, intending to use it to monitor them as feudal elements. When allocating agricultural tax in March this year, the Poor Peasant League and the assessors, under the control of the cadres, increased the burden on middle peasants based on family circumstances (i.e., the past method of assigning reasonable burdens). After it was decided in one night, they announced it to everyone immediately (assessing the taxes while holding a meeting). The new middle peasant Fan Shengguang said dissatisfiedly: "What is family circumstances? What kind of thing is family circumstances?" The old middle peasant Lü Laosheng said after the meeting: "Xiguan and Zhaiyang are allocated by the share, only our village is not allocated by the share." Some said: "Let them handle it as they see fit." New and old middle peasants united, and opinions were rife. Seeing that something was wrong, they changed another way to increase the burden on middle peasants: they divided the masses into five categories (Section Chief Ma of the county participated in the levy for two or three nights), the first category was fifty-eight households, each share (rich strength share) was 14.2 yuan; the second category was twelve households, each share was 7.1 yuan; the third category was three households, each share was 4.7 yuan; the fourth category was three households, each share was 3.5 yuan; the fifth category was three households, not burdened. The middle peasants Lü Sanhei (good labor, diligent and careful, wealthy family, and also has several large trees) and Guan Yulan were classified as special households. In addition to bearing 14.2 yuan per share, each household took care of another household, so that Lü Sanhei had to pay 1,425 yuan more; Guan Yulan had to pay 1,675 yuan more. At the land allocation meeting, because the district cadres had mentioned that middle peasants could also cultivate land, they saw that Lü Sanhei was strong in labor and had little land, and proposed that he cultivate two mu. Sanhei anxiously shouted: "I don't want it! Give it to the poor peasants! Who is older and who is younger, you ask me to pay more when allocating taxes, taking care of you; now you give me land, just want me to produce grain to support you! That's right! I'll go to the government to file a lawsuit, if you detain me, then detain me!" The middle peasant Yan Ling also said in the people's school: "My land is growing crops, your land is growing thatch (referring to two people in the Poor Peasant League who produced a lot of grain, but wasted it)?" (Zhang Xin of the Poor Peasant League said: "If we couldn't beat them now, in the past we would have to fight them with benches!") After the meeting, some said: "Like Sanhei, in the past we would have to detain him!" This formed a situation where poor peasants and middle peasants could not meet, and they would quarrel as soon as they met. After the district cadres saw this, they separately summoned the cadres, the Poor Peasant League, and the Middle Peasants' Association, and also conducted self-criticism at the mass meeting, mutually admitting their mistakes, and the relationship was better than before; but because they did not combine it with correcting the deviations, it was not resolved well.

(Editor's note: Since Section Chief Ma of the county government participated in the tax allocation, he should make a self-criticism, and not attribute all the mistakes to the village chief and the Poor Peasant League.)

　　内邱南关、村干操纵“贫雇团”
    随意多派中农款
  　区干只叫检讨不加纠正
    【内邱消息】内邱城南关贫雇团十三人，内有干部三人。支书吕小三、农会主席李大片，都是翻身展的，也参加了，贫农团主任郭喜来，受着他们的支配，一贯侵犯中农利益。土地法大纲颁布后，他们私自偷着将九户中农划为富农，据村干部说，是公安局向他们要群众成份登记表时，他们才划的，准备拿上当封建来监视。今年三月派农业税款时，贫雇团和评议员在干部的掌握下，按家庭状况（即过去的派合理负担办法）加重中农负担，一晚上派出来，即向大家公布（一面评款一面开会）。新中农樊生广不满意的说：“啥是家庭状况？家庭状况是啥东西？”老中农吕老胜会后说：“西关、寨阳都是按份派，就咱村不按份派。”有的说：“人家办成啥算啥吧。”新老中农结成一体，舆论纷纷。他们看着不对头，换了另一种加重中农的办法：把群众分为五类（当时有县马科长参加了两三晚上派款），第一类五十八户，每份（富力份）十四元二；第二类十二户，每份七元一；第三类三户，每份四元七；第四类三户，每份三元五；第五类三户，不负担。把中农吕三黑（劳力好，勤俭仔细，家庭富裕，另外还有几棵大树）和官玉兰划成特别户。除每人每份负担十四元二外，每户照顾一户，叫吕三黑多出了一千四百二十五元；官玉兰多出了一千六百七十五元。在分配土地的会议上，贫雇团因区干部提过中农也可以种，他们看吕三黑劳动强，地少，提出叫他种二亩。三黑着急的叫起来：“我不要！给了贫雇吧！你们谁老谁小，派款叫我多出，照顾你们；现在给我地，光叫我打下粮食养活你们哩！合着哩！到政府打官司，扣起来就扣起来！”中农延令在民校里也说：“俺的地长着庄稼，你们的地长的是茅草（指贫雇团内有二人打的粮食不少，都浪费了！？”（贫雇团张信说：“这时候不叫打，在过去总得和他们擂板凳！”散会后，有的说：“象三黑这样，在过去非扣起来不行！”这样就形成了贫雇中农不能见面，一见面就吵。区干部看到后，分开召集了干部、贫农团、中农会，又在群众大会上进行了检讨，互相承认了错误，关系比前好了一些；但由于没有结合纠正偏向，没有解决的很好。（内邱县联合办公室）
    （编者按：既然县府马科长参加派款，他就应做自我批评，而不能把一切错误都归到村长及贫农团身上。）
