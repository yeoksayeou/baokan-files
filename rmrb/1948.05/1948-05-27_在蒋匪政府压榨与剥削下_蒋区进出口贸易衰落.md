Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Under the oppression and exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government, import and export trade in the Chiang-controlled areas is declining daily. According to statistics, the amount of foreign exchange settled for exports in the Chiang-controlled areas in the first quarter of this year is as follows: In January, it was 14,814,000 yuan (unit: US dollars, same below); in February, it dropped to 9,282,000 yuan; in March, it rose slightly to 10,742,000 yuan, but it was still more than a quarter lower than in January. Imports also show the same trend. During the same period, the amount of foreign exchange purchased by importers in the Chiang-controlled areas each month was as follows: In January, it was 17,165,000 yuan (unit: US dollars, same below); in February, it decreased to 14,373,000 yuan; and in March, it continued to decline to 14,130,000 yuan. Although there are no statistics for imports and exports in April and May, financial circles in Shanghai pointed out not long ago: "In the past, the official exchange rate (referring to the US dollar exchange rate stipulated by the Chiang government) differed from the actual situation by 80 to 100 percent, but now it has increased to more than 200 percent, which has brought export trade to a standstill." On the other hand, smuggling is rampant in the Chiang-controlled areas. According to news from Chiang-controlled newspapers, in January and February alone, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit customs seized a total of 2,906 cases of smuggled goods, valued at 104.583 billion yuan (Chiang currency), and it is estimated that the unseized smuggled goods are more than twice the amount of those seized. Liu Chengyu, Chiang's Supervisory Envoy of Guangdong and Guangxi, said: "What the customs seize are all small-scale smugglers, and the large-scale smugglers cannot be caught." Chiang-controlled newspapers also revealed: "A gold smuggling group has long been established between Hankou and Guangzhou. These groups have special backgrounds and transport gold about once every ten days, with each shipment amounting to hundreds of taels." And these are all impossible to catch, and those who suffer are mostly "small-scale smugglers who are forced by life."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. According to news from Chiang-controlled newspapers: As of mid-April, the average retail sales of stores in Shanghai decreased by one-third compared with March, and factories in general are deeply threatened by shutdowns. Tian Shun and China Match Factories in Tianjin, and Guanghua Paper Mill in Tangshan, were successively forced to shut down last month. Yanjing Paper Mill in Beiping also temporarily shut down once. At the beginning of last month, when the Tianjin Industrial Association held a meeting, private yarn mills expressed extreme dissatisfaction and indignation at Chiang Kai-shek's strangling policies. They said: "Due to the (Chiang Kai-shek) authorities' implementation of cotton yarn control, private yarn mills will all be forced to close down."

　　在蒋匪政府压榨与剥削下
  　蒋区进出口贸易衰落
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】在蒋匪政府的压榨与剥削之下，蒋管区的进出口贸易正日益衰落。据统计，今年第一季将管区各月份出口结汇金额如下：一月份计一千四百八十一万四千元（单位美金，下同），二月份下降为九百二十八万二千元，三月份微有上涨，计为一千零七十四万二千元，但较一月份仍跌落四分之一以上。进口方面亦具有相同趋势。同前时期内，蒋管区各月份进口商购买外汇金额如下：一月份为一千七百一十六万五千元（单位美金，下同），二月份下降为一千四百三十七万三千元，至三月份仍继续有跌落，计为一千四百一十三万元。四五两月之进出口虽尚无统计，但不久以前上海金融界人士曾指出：“过去公开汇率（按指蒋政府规定之美金汇率）与实际情况相差百分之八十到一百，但现在却增到百分之二百以上，这就使得出口贸易陷于停顿。”另一方面，蒋管区走私之风日炽。据蒋区报纸消息，今年仅一二两个月份内，蒋匪海关所缉获私货共二千九百零六起，估值一千零四十五亿八千三百余万元（蒋币），且据估计，未缉获之私货为已缉获者二倍以上。蒋记两广监察使刘成禹就说：“海关所缉获到的都是中级以下的走私，中级以上的都捉不到。”蒋区报纸并透露：“汉口与广州之间，早有黄金走私集团成立，此等集团有特殊背景，大约十天走运一次，每次黄金数量均达数百两之巨。”而这些都是捉不到的，遭殃的多是那些“为生活所迫的零星走私者”。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据蒋区报纸消息：沪市各商店门市营业四月中旬止，平均较三月份减少达三分之一，一般工厂则已深受停工威胁。津市天顺、中国两火柴厂及唐山光华造纸厂等，均于上月相继被迫停工，北平燕京造纸厂亦曾一度停工。上月初津市工业协会举行会议时，民营纱厂对蒋匪扼杀政策表示极度不满与愤慨，他们说：“由于（蒋匪）当局实施棉纱管制，民营纱厂都将要关门了。”
