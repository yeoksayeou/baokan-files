　　Small Stories from the Dabie Mountains
　　(1) Filling the Water Jar with Firewood
　　The People's Liberation Army unit stationed in a certain village in Jinzhai (Lihuang) County saw that the masses in the village had difficulty obtaining firewood. The soldiers went up the mountains to gather firewood and cut wild grass. Every morning and evening, the hillsides were filled with soldiers gathering firewood. During their entire stationing, they gathered more than 20,000 catties of firewood. In addition to solving their own firewood needs, they also gave it to the "老板" (laoban, meaning villagers/old folks) who had no firewood. The soldiers cherished the rice straw very much, concerned about the difficulties faced by the masses in feeding their livestock. They always picked up and retrieved stray straw from the streets and water, handing it over to the masses. Each time they set out on a mission, they made sure to bundle the borrowed straw properly and return it. The soldiers also paid attention to the "filling the jar" movement. The night before they set off, they would even carry torches to fill the "老板"'s water jars. Now, a folk song composed by the soldiers is popular within the army: "Sending ashes in the snow, delivering firewood in the rain, carrying torches to fill the jar, the '老板' are overjoyed."
　　(2) Relatives Return
　　When the People's Liberation Army returned to a certain village that used to be an old Soviet area, communication soldier Liu Fengzhang saw an old woman wearing only a single layer of clothing in the snowy weather. He told the captain, "Give my cotton-padded coat to the '老板娘' (laoban niang, meaning the wife of the 老板/villagers), I'd rather be a little cold." Subsequently, many soldiers also took out their clothing and blankets to give to the poor masses. An '老板娘', as if confiding in relatives, said to the soldiers, "After the Red Army left, the White bandits came and committed arson and murder on a large scale. Of the 400 people in our village, only some old, weak, and disabled people are left. The young women were all snatched away and sold." Pointing to her dilapidated house, she said, "This house was burned three times by the White bandits, and my child and I rebuilt it ourselves. Comrades, we have suffered severely." Many people regarded the People's Liberation Army as relatives returning home. Seeing the soldiers wearing straw sandals, they cut cloth from their own worn-out single coats to make shoes for the soldiers. The soldiers politely declined, and said with emotion, "No matter how difficult, we will resolutely fight Chiang Kai-shek and avenge our grievances!"

　　大别山的小故事
    （一）砍柴满缸
    住在金寨（立煌）县某湾的解放军看到湾里群众烧柴困难，战士们都上山去拾柴割野草。每天早晨和傍晚，山坡上都是拾柴的战士。在整个驻军期间他们拾了二万多斤柴，除解决自己烧柴外，还送给没柴烧的老板（老乡）。战士们对稻草非常爱惜，关心群众喂牲口的困难，他们随时把遗散在街上和水里的草拾起捞出，交给群众。每次出发时，对借的草都注意捆好交还。战士们对满缸运动也很注意。晚上临出发前还打着火把给老板的水缸挑满，现在部队内流行着战士自编的小调：“雪里送灰，雨中送柴，点着火把担满缸，老板见了喜洋洋。”
    （二）亲人归来
    解放军回到从前是老苏区的某湾子，通讯员刘凤章看到一位老太太在雪天里还穿着单衣，便找队长说：“把我的棉袄给老板娘吧，我宁愿受点冷。”接着很多战士也都拿出衣被送给穷苦的群众。一位老板娘象向亲人诉苦似的对战士说：“红军走后，白匪来了大烧大杀，我湾子四百口人，现在只剩些老弱残废，年青的女人都被抢走卖了。”她指着她的破烂的房子说：“这房子被白匪烧过三次，是我和孩子一手补起来的。同志，我们受打击得狠啦。”很多群众把解放军看做回了家的亲人，看到战士们穿着草鞋，就在自己穿的破单袄上剪布作鞋给战士，战士们都婉谢了，并感动的说：“不论如何艰苦，我们都坚决打蒋介石，报咱们的仇！”
