Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: The Northeast Military Region recently announced the new positions for former Kuomintang army generals who revolted against the Kuomintang and joined the People's Liberation Army: General Pan Shuoduan as Deputy Commander of the Nenjiang Military Region, General Han Meicun as Commander of the Independent Sixth Division of the Ji-Cha-Re-Liao Military Region, General Ma Yifei as Deputy Commander of the Independent Sixth Division of the Jilin Military Region, General Wei Ying as Deputy Commander of the Fifth Sub-district of the Liaoji Military Region, and General Wang Jiashan as Commander of the Independent Fifth Division of the Liaodong Military Region. All have now assumed their posts. Since being reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, the troops led by General Pan and others have demonstrated high morale, harmonious officer-soldier relations, and have been deployed to the front lines to build military merit, earning the praise of the military and civilians in the liberated areas. The leaders of the Northeast Military Region have very high expectations for these units.

It is reported that General Pan Shuoduan, a native of Xuanwei, Yunnan, is 47 years old. He was formerly the commander of the 184th Division of the Chiang army. In late May 1946, he led his troops in the Haicheng Uprising and subsequently served as the commander of the First Army of the Democratic Allied Army. General Han Meicun, a native of Huarong, Hunan, is 42 years old. He was formerly the commander of the Third Security Detachment of the Chiang army in Northeast China. After the anti-Chiang uprising in Lingyuan on "May 1st" last year, he served as the commander of the First Independent Brigade of the Democratic National Salvation Army of Rehe. General Ma Yifei, 41 years old, a native of Yanjin, Yunnan, was the chief of staff of the former Chiang army's 184th Division, and served as the chief of staff of the Democratic Allied Army after the Haicheng Uprising. General Wei Ying, 41 years old, a native of Xuanwei, Yunnan, was the deputy commander of the former Chiang army's 184th Division, and served as the detachment leader of the Democratic Allied Army after the Haicheng Uprising. General Wang Jiashan, 46 years old, a native of Bayan County, Songjiang, was the commander of the former Chiang army's Provisional 58th Division. He led his troops in an uprising and joined the Northeast People's Liberation Army simultaneously with the liberation of Yingkou by the Northeast People's Liberation Army on February 25th of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th: Fan Qi’s Unit of the Weixian Self-Defense Corps (formerly mistakenly written as Fan Qi＠), which gloriously revolted during the Weixian Campaign, has recently been reorganized into the Second Independent Regiment of the Jiaodong West Sea Military Sub-district. Fan serves as the regiment commander. At the celebration of the regiment's establishment, Deputy Commander Cong of the sub-district earnestly encouraged the regiment to settle down to study, intensify training, and truly transform into the people's army. At the inauguration ceremony, Regiment Commander Fan led all officers and soldiers in swearing an oath: We are willing to serve the people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, resolutely support and implement the Land Law Outline, and strive to overthrow the Kuomintang bandit gang and build a new China.
