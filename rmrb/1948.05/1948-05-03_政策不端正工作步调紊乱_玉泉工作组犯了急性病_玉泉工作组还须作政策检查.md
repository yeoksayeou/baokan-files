　　Incorrect Policies and Disordered Work Pace
  　Yuquan Work Group Suffers from Acute Impatience
  　Yuquan Work Group Must Also Conduct a Policy Review
    [Report from this newspaper] The Yuquan Work Group of the Taihang Fourth District Committee arrived in Yuquan Village, Lingchuan County, on March 16th. After more than 20 days of work, they failed to achieve any practical results in reorganizing the masses' ranks or rectifying the Party. Problems remained unresolved, the masses' morale was low, and the work group felt frustrated. On April 10th, the work group held a review meeting. After two days of discussion, they clarified that the root of the problem was the work group's "acute impatience." Initially, they contacted eighty to ninety poor and hired peasants. Hearing a few people requesting organization, the leading comrades did not carefully study how to mobilize the poor and hired peasants ideologically and hastily decided to establish a Poor Peasants' Association. Other comrades in the work group were still deeply involved in mobilizing the poor and hired peasants when they suddenly heard that the Poor Peasants' Association would be established the day after tomorrow, causing them all to panic. One said that women had not yet been mobilized, and another said that there had not been enough preparation. Later, the higher-ups criticized them, saying, "It's too early to establish a Poor Peasants' Association!" So they stopped and switched to Party rectification. Seeing reports that Xiangtan Nanli had completed Party rectification in ten days, they became anxious. Without considering the specific conditions, they blindly decided to complete the Party rectification task in a few days. The masses had no understanding of the Party, simply demanding to vent their anger and overthrow the Party member cadres. Within the branch, self-reflection had only just begun, and in some cases hadn't even started, so there was a huge gap between the two sides' thinking. Yet, the leading comrades wanted to invite the masses to participate in Party rectification. Some comrades in the work group disagreed with this approach but were rebuffed. In mobilizing the masses, instead of a widespread mobilization, they assigned a few representatives to collect the masses' opinions of Party member cadres. As a result, a few factionalists and ousted cadres took the opportunity to retaliate, uniting with some of the masses who were dissatisfied with the cadres and Party members, demanding to beat the Party member cadres, saying that if they didn't beat them, they wouldn't give up their possessions. Some ambitious elements even proposed to abolish the branch. The work group, without understanding the situation, followed these erroneous opinions, starting by rectifying the Party members with the biggest problems. As a result, the problems could not be resolved quickly, and the Party member cadres became even more confused, feeling trapped. The masses, feeling that their problems were not being resolved, became discouraged, saying, "Our eyes are tired, the land is barren, people have been offended, and nothing has been accomplished." At this time, the old cadres were suspended, and new cadres had not yet been produced. Some of the masses suggested that there was an urgent need to find a leader to lead production. The leading comrades of the work group then abandoned Party rectification (which had no direction) and decided to establish a Poor Peasants' Association. Without discussion by the work group, they simply gathered a few representatives and hastily arranged a meeting. When the establishment meeting was held, the comrades of the work group still thought it was Party rectification and even invited honest middle peasants. At the meeting, they learned that it was the establishment of the Poor Peasants' Association. When it came to vetting the members, these middle peasants were all vetted out, causing dissatisfaction among them. After the meeting, they went to the people who had called them to the meeting and said, "I told you I didn't want to go, but you insisted on calling me. Now I've been kicked out again. Luckily it was at night, or I wouldn't have had the face to show my face." The poor peasants also didn't know what they were being vetted for, saying it was for spies, causing them to be suspicious and uneasy. The leading comrades were extremely busy all day, but the work group comrades couldn't get involved, feeling like they had nothing to do. The work became passive, and morale was low. The masses were even more confused. In the review, everyone believed that the work group's leadership suffered from "acute impatience," acted with paternalism, and lacked democracy. The comrades below were guilty of liberalism and a purely task-oriented viewpoint. These errors were strictly criticized, and it was decided that in the future, democracy should be promoted, the poor and hired peasants should be re-approached, self-criticisms should be made, the masses' opinions should be listened to, honest poor and hired peasants should be further patiently and deeply mobilized, class boundaries should be clearly drawn, the masses' ranks should be rectified, and, in combination with spring plowing and production, specific organization and leadership should be provided.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Yuquan Work Group)
    It is good that the Yuquan Work Group reviewed its "acute impatience," but the root cause and severity of the errors require a thorough review from a policy and ideological perspective. This is by no means just a matter of work style. More importantly, the implementation of policies is incorrect and flawed. The work group did not understand the purpose of the democratic Party rectification policy and acted rashly. For example, they could hastily decide to establish a Poor Peasants' Association without class division or considering specific conditions, and they could hold a Poor Peasants' Association establishment meeting without fully mobilizing the poor and hired peasants themselves. They also did not clearly understand the principle of Party rectification as curing illnesses and saving people through transformation and education, abandoning leadership and becoming the tail of a few people. The errors committed by the Yuquan Work Group and the losses they brought to the work proved how correct and brilliant the Central Committee's instructions for old and semi-old liberated areas were: "In places without effective leaders or a sound work team, it is better to postpone mobilization than to rush for quick results, which may lead to detours." In areas that have taken such detours, the movement should be resolutely stopped and switched to production until the leadership is truly strengthened. This is a lesson that all regions should deeply understand and not repeat.

### 政策不端正工作步调紊乱　玉泉工作组犯了急性病　玉泉工作组还须作政策检查

　　政策不端正工作步调紊乱
  　玉泉工作组犯了急性病
  　玉泉工作组还须作政策检查
    【本报消息】太行四地委玉泉工作组于三月十六日到达陵川玉泉村，经过二十多天工作，整编群众队伍与整党工作都未做出实际成绩，问题也未得到解决，群众情绪消沉，工作组感到苦闷。四月十日工作组召开检讨会，经过两天研究，明确了问题的根源是工作组存在着急性病。他们开始时串连了八、九十个贫雇，听到少数人要求组织，领导同志也没细心研究贫雇思想发动如何，就个人轻率决定成立贫农团。工作组其他同志还正在深入发动贫雇，突然听到明后天要成立贫农团，都手忙脚乱起来。这个说妇女还没有发动，那个说还没有酝酿好。后来上级批评说：“成立贫农团还早哩”！又停止进行，转入整党。看到报上襄坦南里信十天整党完毕，就着急起来。不看具体条件，盲目决定要在几天内完成整党任务。群众对党毫无认识，只是单纯要求出气，要求从党员干部身上翻身；支部内才开始反省，有的还没有反省下去，两方面思想还距离很远，领导同志就要请群众来参加整党。工作组有的同志不同意这样做，反而碰了钉子。在发动群众上，不是普遍发动，而是布置少数代表搜集群众对党员干部的意见。这样，少数闹宗派的和下台干部便趁机报复，结合一部分对干部党员不满的群众，提出要打党员干部，说不打退不出东西。还有野心分子提出要取消支部，工作组不了解情况，便跟着错误意见跑，先整问题大的党员。结果，问题不能迅速解决，反闹得党员干部思想更混乱，觉得上天无路，入地无门。群众则因没解决问题而泄了气说：“眼也熬啦，地也荒啦，人也得罪啦，啥也没弄成个片片”。这时，老干部停了职，新干部也没产生，部分群众提议，急须找个头头领导生产，工作组领导同志便又抛开整党（尚无头绪），决定成立贫农团，没通过工作组大家研究，召集了几个代表简单布置开会。开成立会时，工作组同志还以为是整党，连老实中农也请来了。到了会上，才知道是成立贫农团。来了个审查团员，这些中农就都被审查出去了，引起中农不满。会后都找着叫他们去开会的人说：“俺说不去吧，你要叫俺去，去了可又把俺撵出来，幸亏是黑夜，要是白天，俺就没脸出那个门。”贫农也不知道是审查啥，说是查特务哩，搞得贫农也怀疑不安心。领导同志一天忙得不可开交，工作组同志却插不进手，感觉没事做，工作陷于被动，情绪消沉，群众更是摸不着头脑。检查中，大家认为工作组领导上犯了急性病与包办代替不民主，下面同志则是自由主义，单纯任务观点。对这些错误做了严格批判，确定今后要发扬民主，重新向贫雇表明态度，作自我检讨，听取群众意见，进一步耐心深入发动老实贫雇，划清阶级界限，整顿群众队伍，并结合春耕生产，具体组织领导。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（玉泉工作组）
    玉泉工作组检讨了急性病是好的，但对急性病的根源和错误的严重性还需要从政策思想上好好检查。这绝不仅是工作作风问题，更重要的是执行政策不端正，有毛病，工作组不了解民主整党政策的目的何在，就轻率下手。例如可以不经过划阶级、不考虑具体条件，就率尔决定成立贫农团，可以不经过贫雇自己充分发动，就召开贫农团成立大会。对整党是治病救人改造教育的方针也不明确，放弃领导，做了少数人的尾巴。玉泉工作组所犯的错误及其给工作带来的损失，证明了中央老区半老区指示所提出的：“凡无得力的领导者或健全的工作团地方，宁暂缓发动，不要急于求成，致走弯路”是多么正确，多么英明。象这类走了弯路的地区，在领导未真正充实之前，应坚决把运动停下来转入生产。这一教训各地都应深刻体会，不要再重复。
