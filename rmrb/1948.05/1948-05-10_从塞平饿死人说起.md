\tStarting with the Starvation Deaths in Saiping

\tThe Central Bureau’s instructions to Taiyue have been issued for over half a month, yet some places have not started to correct deviations. In Nanguan, Neiqiu, some mutual aid teams are still giving landlords half wages. The “control” in Saiping Village, Gaoping, has not been lifted, and they still insist on the erroneous method of unpaid labor, which has even led to starvation deaths. Similar situations exist, more or less, in various places. Some do not resettle landlords, believing that “middle peasants should come before landlords,” which fundamentally violates the Central Bureau’s policy of handling compensation for wrongly struggled households and resettlement of landlords and rich peasants simultaneously. Some are unwilling to unseal the property of landlords and rich peasants, considering unsealing to be capitulationism. Some completely disregard the difficulties of those who have been swept out the door, unable to live or produce, and fail to actively implement the Party’s policies and earnestly correct deviations. Instead, they set up empty “production mutual aid plans” or subjectively create a propaganda campaign that is not combined with practical action. These practices, it can be said with certainty, are all wrong. The starvation deaths in Saiping Village are a serious manifestation of the continued development and persistence of this leftist error. The leadership should bear the main responsibility for this. The Central Bureau’s instructions were issued a long time ago, so why haven’t they earnestly checked for errors and gone down to the villages to correct deviations like the Yangcheng County Committee did? Why haven’t they checked various phenomena of disobeying policies beforehand, and when they are discovered, not seriously dealt with and resolutely corrected? The Central Bureau instructed the District Party Committee to understand the situation in the entire district and correct various deviations within a week. How has this been implemented in various places? From the recent letters we have received from readers in various places, everyone has expressed heartfelt support and joy for the various policy instructions of the Central Bureau. However, they still have some doubts about the specific implementation at the lower levels. The main reason is that some local leaders have not yet expressed their attitude towards past leftist errors and have not yet truly started to correct them. The determination and courage shown are not enough, which is no wonder it creates a general misperception among the masses. We hope that various places should not only issue instructions and shout slogans, but now should be determined to truly go down to the villages and personally correct deviations and promote production. It must be done, and done practically. Setting an example is the only way to promote the overall situation and stabilize people’s hearts. Otherwise, we can only sit back and watch the errors develop and expand.

### 从塞平饿死人说起

　　从塞平饿死人说起
    中央局对太岳指示已下达半月有余，有些地方纠偏仍未动手。内邱南关有的互助组仍旧给地主一半工资，高平塞平村“管制”尚未取消，至今仍坚持错误的无偿劳动办法，竟致饿死了人。类似这种情形，各地或多或少都还存在。有的不安置地主，认为应该“先中农而后地主”根本违背了中央局指示的补偿错斗户同安置地主富农同时处理的方针；有的不愿给地主富农启封，认为启封是投降主义；有的根本漠视扫地出门的被斗户无法生活、无法生产的困难，不去积极执行党的政策，认真纠正偏向，反而布置一套空洞的“生产互助计划”，或是主观的制造一个不与实际行动结合的宣传运动。这些做法，可以肯定说都是错误的，塞平村饿死了人，就是这种左倾错误继续发展和坚持的严重表现。其所以如此，我们认为领导上应负主要责任。中央局的指示老早发下去了，为什么不去认真检查错误，象阳城县委那样亲自下乡去纠正偏向呢？为什么事先不检查违抗政策的各种现象，及至发现了，也不严肃处理、坚决纠正呢？中央局指示区党委一个星期内就要了解全区情况，纠正各种偏向，这一条各地执行的又如何？从最近我们接到各地读者来信看，大家对中央局的各种政策指示一致表示了衷心的拥护和喜悦。但对于具体的在下边执行，他们还保有若干疑虑。主要的原因是有些地方领导上对过去的左倾错误至今仍未表示态度，仍未真正动手来纠正，决心和勇气都表现得很不够，无怪乎要造成一般群众的错觉。我们希望各地不仅要发指示、喊口号，现在应该下决心真正到乡下去亲自动手，纠正偏向，推动生产。一定要做，切切实实的做。做出了榜样，才能推动全面，安定人心，否则只有坐视错误发展和扩大。
