    In order to prosper the market, facilitate free trade, develop industry and commerce, and serve farmers extensively, we have specially expanded the April Department Store Conference. On the 30th day of the third lunar month, we held a city-wide artistic performance to celebrate the opening of the conference; the official conference was scheduled to begin on the fifth day of the fourth lunar month and continue until the end of the month. All our city's factories and shops have prepared a large number of goods, such as agricultural tools like sickles, plows, harrows, hoes, cotton bows, brooms, awls, sieves, and wooden forks; daily necessities like pots, pot lids, steamers, bamboo baskets, bellows, and bamboo baskets; daily items like socks, towels, various colored floral fabrics, soap, paper, and new seasonal shoes; and various kinds of pickles, fermented bean curd, stinky tofu, and various kinds of dim sum candies, etc. All are of extremely high quality and low prices. Customers from all regions are welcome for retail and wholesale. We sincerely look forward to factories, shops, and peddlers from all regions coming to sell various goods, especially various agricultural tools, and to engage in exchange trade of cotton, salt, grain, livestock, medicinal materials, and homespun cloth. Our association will do its best to entertain and help promote sales. All expenses will be abolished. Merchants from all liberated areas are welcome to come for free trade and sightseeing. The government will provide guarantees in all aspects. For the sake of economy, the sale of superstitious items is prohibited at the venue. At that time, there will be performances by new drama troupes, old drama troupes, drum storytelling, circuses, dragon lanterns, stilt walkers, and Taishi, which will be extremely lively, and a night market will be opened, with lights as bright as day. Fellow farmers and business people who have been emancipated from all regions, do not miss this opportunity. We will provide appropriate care when you come!
