　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Tokyo, 12th: Under the violent support of MacArthur, Japanese reactionary financial groups are not only preparing new anti-labor laws, but are also intensifying their conspiracy to use right-wing socialists to split the labor movement. Hall Takumi, chairman of the Japan Federation of Industrial Organizations, issued a statement on this matter, stating that the right-wing socialists formed the so-called "Trade Union Democratization League," touting "opposition to communist influence," with the aim of preventing the unity of the All-Japan labor movement, to facilitate capitalists attacking workers. He called on the Industrial Federation to "exert all efforts to fight to crush infringements on workers' basic legitimate rights." In other news: The Kanagawa Prefecture "May Day Demonstration Liaison Committee" recently sent a letter of protest to MacArthur and the Allied Council for Japan, condemning the U.S. military police for suppressing the Yokohama May Day demonstration, protesting the U.S. military authorities' order to the Yokosuka police to record the names and addresses of all demonstrators, and protesting the unreasonable arrest of two members of the committee and other reactionary measures.

    【新华社陕北十八日电】东京十二日讯：在麦克阿瑟暴力支援下，日本反动财阀除正在准备新的反劳工法外，并加紧其利用右派社会党人分裂工运等阴谋。日本产业别组合联合会主席听涛克已特为此发表声明称：右翼社会党人组成所谓“职工会民主化联盟”，标榜“反对共产党的影响”，其目的在于阻止全日职工运动的团结，以便利于资本家向工人进攻。他号召产联“竭尽一切努力，为粉碎侵害工人基本合法权利而斗争”。另讯：日本神奈川县“五一示威联络委员会”，日前曾向麦克阿瑟及盟国对日委员会致抗议书，谴责美国宪警镇压横滨五一示威，并抗议美军当局命令横须贺警察记下一切示威者的姓名、地址，以及无理拘捕该委员会两名委员等反动措施。
