[Changzhi News] The Fifth District convened a production work group meeting on the 28th of last month to study the main problems in the current production work, which is that "leftist" errors are hindering production. Last autumn, the burden of grain procurement unilaterally favored the poor and hired laborers, generally increasing the burden on middle peasants and above, forming a disguised form of struggle. For example, Guo Huailin, a middle peasant in Yaogou Village, had his public grain burden increased to more than 1,800 catties, forcing him to auction off most of his land and property. He is still not allowed to participate in mutual aid, and he does not dare to ask for wages when working for others. When village cadres report their work to the district, they still say that he is a "managing landlord." According to the head of Bayi Village: in March, cadres in Nanyaogou were incited by individual bad elements and privately classified classes without going through the district, classifying eleven middle-peasant households as rich peasants (tracing back three generations) and excluding six production workers from the cooperative from joining mutual aid groups. Furthermore, militia member Zhang Jinkui said to the production workers, "I am here to monitor you." Lao Yong and middle peasant Qin Baoshan of Bayi Village said: "You won't be comfortable for a few more days. In a few days, you will be struggled against!" He also told the political director that the poor peasant group he led (a fake one) planned to expel five middle-peasant households, including Xiao Pang, from the hospital, leaving the political director at a loss as to what was happening. Qin Haishui (a poor peasant veteran) heard the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, so he cut off meat and bought flour, ate and drank extravagantly, wasted all his grain, and then went to borrow grain from Qin Changfa, a middle peasant, threatening, "If you don't lend me grain, I will struggle against you." Qin Changfa said: "If you struggle against me, even if I lend you grain, you won't be able to protect me." As a result, he didn't borrow any grain and then threatened Gui Ze to borrow five dou of corn. In terms of loans and profit sharing, middle peasants were also excluded. Last winter, during production, the loans were completely given to poor and hired laborers. The mutual aid group stipulated that profits should be distributed according to capital, and poor and hired laborers with more capital could share more profits. As a result, some groups lost money and then distributed the losses according to labor (such as the ×× group, which lost 120,000 yuan and distributed 60,000 yuan in losses). Because the interests of the middle peasants were seriously infringed upon, panic and unrest were created in the countryside, hindering production. For example, De Ming, a middle peasant in Bayi Village, said: "I'll live one day at a time." After eating the grain, he didn't go to production but sold his cart and tiles. Some said: "Stripping from middle peasants little by little (零刮, i.e. slow struggle) is not as good as being struggled against like landlords." The occurrence of this phenomenon is due to our insufficient publicity of policies, which has allowed a few bad elements to take advantage of loopholes. For example, the masses in Bayi still do not understand our policies, especially the middle peasant policy, so the village cadres say whatever the few bad elements say about many policy issues. Now, with the spring agricultural income tax, the district has instructed to handle matters in accordance with policies, but when it reaches the village, the burden on middle peasants is still arbitrarily increased. Also, Feng Yushan of Dongping Shang reads reports about how bad cadres are…, to specifically attack cadres, causing cadres to not dare to lead work. Political Director Liu Tiemao and others regret becoming cadres and bitterly want to die. Some cadres say: "It's better to just work the land and not lead the work, so that one can keep one's reputation."

According to the above situation, it is necessary to widely publicize policies in the organization of production and guide the masses to correct "leftist" deviations. Villages such as Goudi have returned the property confiscated from middle peasants during last year's public grain levy, and other villages are correcting deviations to stabilize production sentiments.

Administrative orders and formalism: at the previous district and village expanded cadre meeting, district cadres mobilized village cadres to challenge each other. The village cadres said: "The challenge should be asked back to the masters (masses)," and the district cadres immediately criticized the village cadres for lying down and not working. In this way, the village cadres had no choice but to challenge, and the district cadres immediately believed that this challenge could stir up the entire district's production work. As a result, only a few villages took up the challenge, causing dissatisfaction among village cadres and the masses. For example, a mass in Nan Song Village said: "Last year, during the autumn plowing, because of the challenge to pursue speed, the land was damaged." Qin Changfa of Bayi Village said: "Last year, because of the challenge, the corn was cut and piled in the field and not allowed to be taken back, only to dig the land, resulting in the corn rotting." Holding meetings without considering the fatigue of the masses, for example, Bayi held a mass meeting on the night of the 26th, with only more than 40 people (the village has 380 households). The time was dragged on for a long time, and not a single problem was solved. The masses said it was too late, and they would not be able to get up the next morning, and they would not have the energy to work the land tomorrow. The correct approach is like Nan Song and Yaogou, through small meetings such as dining halls and mutual aid groups, to arrange time to solve problems in a planned way.

From the production inspection in the Fifth District of Changzhi, the main problem at present is the evil consequences of "leftist" errors, which seriously affect production. These "leftist" errors continued to occur in March and have not yet been decisively and effectively corrected. Now, simply "widely publicizing policies" is not enough. The leadership must have decisive and clear measures to immediately correct "leftist" errors, compensate the middle peasants who have been harmed, and resettle the landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of their homes so that they can embark on production. It is necessary to guide and educate the masses to implement policies, but we cannot delay the resolute implementation of policies because of this. Otherwise, the chaos and panic will not stop, and production will still not be able to break out of the situation.

　　只宣传政策无必要措施
  　长治五区纠偏不坚决
    【长治消息】五区于上月二十八日召开生产工作组会议研究当前生产工作中的主要问题，是左倾错误妨碍生产。去秋负担片面的照顾雇贫，对中农以上户普遍加重，形成变相的斗争。如窑沟村中农郭怀林公粮加重为一千八百余斤，逼使土地财产拍卖大部，到现在仍不让参加互助，给别人做工，也不敢要工资，村干部在区汇报工作，还说人家是经营地主。据八义村长说：南窑沟三月间干部受个别坏分子的挑动，没有通过区上就私自划了一次阶级，将十一户中农划为富农（追三代），并排斥合作社六个生产员不让入互助组，并有民兵张金魁对生产员说，我是来监视你们的。八义村老勇和中农秦保山说：“你再舒服不上几天啦，等几天就要斗争你哩！”他又向政治主任说，他领导的贫农团（假的），计划小胖等五户中农得出院，弄的政治主任也不知道是怎会事。秦海水（贫农荣退军人）听到土地法大纲公布，就割肉买面，大吃大喝，将粮食浪费光了，就去和中农秦长发借粮，吓唬说：“你不借给我粮，就要斗争你。”秦长法说：“要是斗争我，就借给你粮食你也包庇不下我。”结果没有借上，又吓唬桂则，借玉茭五斗。在贷款和分红上，也是排斥中农。去冬生产时，把款完全贷给贫雇，互助组规定按资分红，贫雇资金多可多分红，结果有的组赔了，就又按劳力赔（如××组十二万赔了六万元）。由于中农利益受到了严重的侵犯，造成农村中恐慌不安，妨碍了生产。如八义村中农德明说：“吃一天算一天。”吃完粮不去生产，卖车卖瓦。有的说：对中农是零刮（零斗）还不如地主痛快。这种现象的发生，是由于我们对政策宣传的不够，致使少数坏分子钻空子，如八义群众到现在对我们的政策特别是中农政策还不了解，就是村干部也是如此，所以村上关于很多政策问题，少数坏分子说啥是啥，如今春起农业所得税，区上布置要按政策办事，到村后仍然是给中农随意加重。又如东平上冯玉山，见了干部就念报上坏干部怎样………，来专门打击干部，闹的干部不敢领导工作。如政治主任刘铁毛等，后悔不该当干部，苦闷的光想寻死。有的干部说：光上地不要领导工作，就可养过名誉来。
    根据以上情况，要在组织生产中广泛宣传政策，诱导群众纠正左倾偏向，沟底等村将去年派公粮没收中农的财产退回，其他村正在纠偏，安定生产情绪。
    行政命令和形式主义，上次在区村扩大干部会议上，区干部动员村干部挑战，村干部说：挑战应回去问问主家（群众）才行，区干部当即批评村干部是躺倒不干。这样村干部只好挑战，区干部即认为经过这一挑战，就可将全区生产工作轰动起来，结果只有几个村挑起来，造成村干部和群众的不满。如南宋村一个群众说：去年秋耕时因挑战光图快，颠倒把地弄坏了。八义村秦长法说：去年因挑战把玉茭割起来堆在地里不叫往回取，光叫掘地，结果把玉茭烂了。工作开会不顾群众疲劳，如八义在二十六日夜召开群众大会，只到四十余人（该村有三百八十户）。时间拉了很久，一个问题也没解决，群众都说不早了，再迟了明早起不来，明天上地没劲。正确的作法是和南宋、窑沟那样，通过饭场、互助组等小型会，有计划的安排时间来解决问题。（振华、效田、春喜）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    从长治五区的生产检查中看，当前主要问题是左倾错误的恶果，严重影响生产。这些左倾错误三月份还在继续发生，至今还没见坚决有效的纠正。现在仅仅“广泛的宣传政策”是不行的，领导上必须有坚决明确的措施，立即纠正左倾错误，被损害的中农设法补偿，扫地出门的地主富农设法安置，使他们能走上生产。诱导教育群众执行政策是必要的，但不能因此而拖延政策的坚决执行。不如此，则混乱恐慌仍不能停止，生产仍将无法打开局面。
