Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 20th. The Border Region Administrative Committee's Agricultural and Forestry Department recently convened an agricultural technology promotion conference, conducting a thorough review of the current phenomenon of agricultural farms in various regions being detached from the masses and reality. It was also decided that future improvements in agricultural technology should start from the most pressing needs of farmers and the existing foundation of agricultural technology in the border region, while also rapidly promoting successful experiments that meet the current needs of farmers. Based on reports from various farms, the conference believed that the past year's experimental work had achieved considerable success. For example, the Border Region Veterinary Serum Manufacturing Plant successfully trial-produced hog cholera serum under rudimentary conditions, producing 10,000 CC, which proved effective in experimental treatments in Fanshi. Farms have also played a certain role in preventing disasters and increasing yields, such as the breeding of Bianyi millet, Wangsan millet, and Tang Sixteen millet. Foreign varieties that have been tested and found suitable for the local area include 811 drought-resistant millet, Golden Queen corn, and Victory No. 9 and No. 10 rice. In particular, after four or five years of effort, a spring and autumn dual-purpose wheat variety has been initially bred. However, the main shortcoming of the farms' work is that they have not effectively helped farmers solve problems. Experimental research does not start from the urgent needs of farmers, but rather involves moving and adhering to the old ways of the bourgeoisie, not learning from the masses, looking down on the methods of the masses, and even competing with the people for profit. For example, some comrades only study what to feed pigs to make them taste better, or what to feed cows to increase milk nutrition, etc. Therefore, they not only do not play a role in rural areas, but also have a negative impact. The conference pointed out that the main reasons for these serious shortcomings are the lack of clear guidelines and management methods in leadership, and the lack of organizational work in production leadership; in technical work, there is a lack of promotion work. Some technicians believe that the experiment is completed once it is successful, and do not do a good job of promotion. Therefore, they cannot test and revise successful things among the masses. The conference decided that in the future, industrial departments at all levels should set up dedicated personnel or departments to be responsible for research and promotion, mainly focusing on the breeding of millet, wheat, cotton, corn, rice, and sorghum, the prevention and control of diseases and pests, and the utilization of alkaline land. In terms of veterinary medicine, 150,000 to 200,000 CC of hog cholera serum will be produced, and hog cholera toxoid vaccine and the soil collection method will be tested for the treatment of equine glanders. In terms of forestry, experiments will be conducted on sowing seeds on barren mountains, afforestation, and continued promotion of windbreak, sand prevention, and spring, summer, and autumn afforestation methods.

　　晋察冀农林处检讨工作
  　纠正农业技术脱离实际
    【新华社晋察冀二十日电】边区行政委员会农林处日前召开农业技术推广会议，对目前各地农场工作脱离群众、脱离实际的现象进行了深刻的检讨。并决定今后农业技术的提高应从农民最迫切需要及边区农业技术现有基础出发，同时将试验成功而又为农民当前需要的迅速推广。会议根据各地农场报告，认为过去一年来各农场试验工作获得不少成绩，如边区兽疫血清制造所在简陋的条件下试制猪霍乱血清成功，并制出一万ＣＣ，曾在繁峙实验治疗有效。各农场对防除灾害提高产量也曾起了一定作用，如育种上有边一谷、望三谷、唐十六谷，将外边的优良品种试验适于本地者有八一一抗旱谷、金皇后玉米、胜利九号、十号稻子等，特别是曾以四、五年时间终于初步育成了春秋两用小麦。但各农场工作的主要缺点，在于还没有切实帮助农民解决问题。试验研究不能从农民的迫切需要出发，搬运及拘泥于资产阶级的老一套，不向群众学习，看不起群众的办法，甚至与民争利，如某些同志只研究用什么东西喂的猪好吃，用什么喂的牛奶养份多等等，因此在农村中不但不起作用，反而影响不好。会议指出，造成这些严重缺点的主要原因，是领导上没有明确的方针及经营方法，生产领导上缺乏组织工作；在技术工作上则缺乏推广工作，有些技术人员认为试验成功了就算交代了，不做很好的推广工作，因此，就不能将成功的东西在群众中去考验修正。会议决定，今后各级实业部门要设专人或专门部门负责研究推广工作，主要是谷子、小麦、棉花、玉蜀黍、水稻、高粱的育种、病虫的防除、及碱地利用。兽疫方面，制造猪霍乱血清十五万至廿万ＣＣ，试验猪霍乱毒血疫苗及集土法治疗马鼻疽。林业方面，试验荒山播种，造林，及继续推广防风、防砂及春夏秋三季造林方法。
