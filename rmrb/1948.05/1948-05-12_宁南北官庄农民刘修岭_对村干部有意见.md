    Liu Xiuling, a farmer from Beiguanzhuang, Ningnan, has opinions about village cadres
    Transcribed by Geng Wenyan
    I am Liu Xiuling from Beiguanzhuang in the third district of Ningnan, and I am forty-five years old this year. Before the incident, my family had nothing. I have been a boatman on the Fuyang River since I was a child (my family has been doing this for four generations). After the incident, my hometown was occupied by the Japanese devils, and all the boats were burned by the enemy. We were starving at home, so in the 27th year of the Republic of China, I fled to Gaoyi Station, first selling miscellaneous noodles, then pushing a cart to make a living. After living there for six years, my hometown was liberated, so I returned home and became a group leader in the farmers' association, and later was elected as a poor peasant representative by the poor and hired peasants.
    In the year or so of turning over, I only received 2,000 yuan and two dou of sorghum. The fruits of the land reform in our village were first distributed to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and then to those who were close to the cadres. They received particularly large shares each time.
    Before last autumn, Jiang Ying, the deputy director of the Armed Forces Committee, Liu Jinting, the director of the Farmers' Association, and Jiang Yutian, the instructor, sold twenty bags of wheat from the struggle and exchanged them for two good oxen, which they took to Shimen and slaughtered. I couldn't stand it and gave them my opinion, asking them a question. This caused trouble. They mobilized Jiang Yuxi (a poor peasant) to say that he had lost a copper spoon and insisted that I stole it. They also used the excuse that I beat someone. On the 23rd day of the seventh month (lunar calendar) last year, they detained me, saying I was crazy, put me in shackles and handcuffs. The militiamen beat me to death several times at night, hitting me with gun butts and sticks, leaving my whole body black and red (my body is still covered with scars – transcriber). I was detained for three months, and was released on October 11th. Because I wore iron shackles for three months, my hands festered and maggots appeared, exposing the white bones. During those three months, I urinated in my pants. At that time, the district cadre Li Rong working in our village and the village cadres together used torture on me, and also said that I was a special agent and traitor.
    On the night of November 22nd last year, police officer Cao Linjiang, instructor Jiang Yutian, Liu Gou Xiao (people called him the living Yama), who had been a puppet soldier, and more than ten others surrounded my house and were about to detain me again. I was so scared that I bolted and propped up the door. They made a lot of noise outside, knocked down a dozen or so bricks from my eaves, and also fired shots. When district and county cadres were meeting, I dared not live at home and hid at relatives' houses for a few days. I only returned to the village after hearing that the district cadres had returned.
    A few days ago, I went to the district to find the district chief. The district cadres said, "We know you have been wronged. Write this matter to the newspaper office and see what crime they have committed." If you are afraid it is not accurate, you can ask the newspaper office to send someone to the village to investigate.

### 宁南北官庄农民刘修岭  对村干部有意见

    宁南北官庄农民刘修岭
    对村干部有意见
    代笔人耿文彦
    我是宁南三区北官庄人，叫刘修岭，今年四十五岁。事变前家里什么也没有。从小就在滏阳河上撑船（我家到我这辈撑了四辈）。事变后，家乡被日本鬼占领，船都叫敌人烧了。在家饿的不行，民国二十七年逃难到高邑车站，先是卖杂面，后来推小车顾嘴。住了六年，家乡解放了，就回到家里，在农会当组长，以后被贫雇选为贫雇代表。
    在一年多的翻身中，我只分过两千元钱与二斗高粱。我村翻身果实是先让抗属分，然后分给与干部接近的人。他们每次分的特别多。
    在去年秋前，武委会副主任姜英、农会主任刘金廷、指导员姜玉田，将斗争果实二十布袋麦子粜了，换了两个好牛，赶到石门杀了，我看不过，给他们提了意见，问了他们一声，这一来可惹下祸了。他们活动姜玉喜（贫农），说他没了铜杓，硬说我偷了，又借口说我打人，在去年七月二十三（阴）把我扣起，说我疯了，给我带上脚镣带上背铐，民兵晚上把我打了几个死，用枪托打，拿棒子打，打的我全身黑一片、红一片（现在身上还是浑身伤痕——代笔人）。一直扣了我三个来月，到十月十一才放出来。因我带了三个来月的铁铐，手上都生了蛆，露出了白骨头。在三个月里，拉尿都往裤里拉。当时在我村工作的区干部李荣与村干部一起给我上刑法，又说我是特务汉奸。
    去年十一月二十二日夜，公安员曹林江、指导员姜玉田、当过伪军的刘狗小（外人叫他活阎王）等十余人，将我家包围住，又要把我扣起来，吓的我把门闸住顶住，人家在外大闹，把我房檐的砖弄掉十几个，又打枪。在区县干部开会时，我不敢在家住，在亲戚家躲了几天，听说区干部回来了，才又回到村里。
    前两天我到区上找区长，区里干部说：“知道你受了冤枉气，你把这事写给报馆，看看犯了什么罪。”如怕不确实，可让报馆派人来村调查。
