To the Editor:

　　There are fourteen municipal houses in Dayang Town, Ben County, owned by the village office. Since our liberation, they have arbitrarily increased the rent for merchants every year. For example:

　　1. Xing Shiying fled the famine to Dayang in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) and made a living as a long-term worker. After earning some money, he lived as a small vendor. In the 34th year (1945), he moved his whole family to Dayang and opened a small grocery store to make a living. He rented two rooms from the village office, paying three dou of wheat per year. In the 35th year (1946), the rent was increased to four dou for no reason. In the 36th year (1947), he occupied another room, making it three rooms, and the rent was increased to one shi and one dou. This year, it was increased again to one shi and eight dou.

　　2. Cui Jiayun is a native of Dayang, from a poor peasant background, and makes a living making cakes. He occupies three rooms. When the Japanese were here, the annual rent was six dou of wheat. After our liberation, he occupied fewer rooms, but it became one shi and seven dou. This year, it was increased to two shi for no reason.

　　Similar to the above, there are a total of fourteen merchants whose rents have gradually increased. However, the poor peasant league in the village said that this was the opinion of the masses, and that you are welcome to occupy if you wish, and someone else will occupy if you don't. Therefore, the merchants dare not speak out and have to listen to the rent increases. Please send a letter of instruction from the newspaper to tell us how to handle this matter.

　　Should the public municipal houses be allocated to the masses? If they are allocated to the masses, can poor merchants be allocated some? Please reply. (Yang Guang, Wang Yida, Linfen County Industry and Tax Bureau)

To Comrades Yang Guang and Wang Yida:

　　It is wrong to arbitrarily increase rent. A unified and appropriate standard should be set by the responsible authorities, and everyone should abide by it. Neither the poor peasant league nor the village office can increase rent without reason. Because doing so only unilaterally protects the interests of the landlords, but increases the burden on businesses and hinders the development of industry and commerce. Those that have already been increased should be lowered according to regulations. Also, how did this village office come to possess these municipal houses? Whether they should be occupied and rented out by the village office should also be studied and decided by the responsible authorities. As for public municipal houses, they cannot be allocated to the masses or merchants. They can be given to the masses to live in, but a certain rent must be charged.

### 房租不应随便提高

　　房租不应随便提高编辑同志：
    本县大阳镇有村公所的市房十四座，自咱们解放后每年任意给商人增加房租，例如：
    一、行世英于民国廿七年逃荒至大阳给人做长工过生活，赚了些钱后，过小摊贩生活，三十四年将全家搬到大阳开了个小杂货铺维持生活。租了村公所房二间，每年出租麦三斗。三十五年无故加到四斗，卅六年增占了房一间，成三间，房租又加到一石一斗，今年又加到一石八斗。
    二、崔甲运是大阳人，贫农成份做饼子生活，占房三间，日本人在时每年房租麦六斗，咱们解放后少占了房间，成了一石七斗，今年又无故加到二石。
    诸如以上共是商号十四家，房租都逐渐增加了，但该村贫雇团人说这是群众的意见，你们愿意占算，不愿意占有人占，所以商人都不敢说话，只好听人家加租。请报社同志来函指示，此事如何处理。
    公共市房是否分配给群众，如分配给群众，贫苦商人是否可以分呢？请答复。（临汾县工税局杨光、王一道）杨光、王一道同志：
    随便加高房租是不对的，应该由负责机关统一规定适当标准，任何人都应该遵守，不管贫农团、村公所，都不能无故加租。因为这样做只片面维护出租者的利益，却加重商家负担，妨害工商业发展。已经提高的，则按规定降低。又这个村公所占有的这些市房来源如何？是否应由村公所占有出租，也应由负责机关研究决定。至于公共市房，不能分配给群众或商人，可以给群众住，但须收一定房租。
