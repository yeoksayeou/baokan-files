Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Front, 5th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, after undergoing land reform and study, and with an unprecedented increase in class consciousness, has, following political and economic democracy, universally launched military democracy, giving full play to the wisdom of the masses, greatly improving military tactics and techniques. The military democracy of this unit began in conjunction with military studies, and then combined with actual battles and campaigns. In military studies, past battles were used as examples, and each participating unit and individual conducted self-criticism from top to bottom based on the specific circumstances and tasks at the time, examining command, coordination of arms, tactical actions, and studying the overall strengths and weaknesses of both sides at the time, drawing lessons and proposing ways to improve in the future. The hero Guo Jisheng's company, in military democratic learning, created a democratic review method of fighting with a large sand table. They made a large sand table showing the actual terrain, fortifications, and firepower deployment of a certain battle. The whole company could watch, and each participant used a small flag to represent themselves, explaining the battle process while moving the small flag according to their actual position in the battle. Then everyone commented on who played a major role in this battle and whose actions were good. Or, if it was decided in advance to investigate a key point or a commander, opinions were focused on that key point or commander. In the specific review process, there was a comparative review method, that is, selecting two combat teams and comparing and commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of their various tactical actions on the sand table to see who was superior. The refutation review method involved liberation fighters who participated in the battle describing the combat actions of our side as seen by the enemy at the time, and comparing them with our side's situation to conduct a review. The measurement review method was to measure whether a certain fighter's or commander's point met the requirements according to military principles and standards, and whether they completed the task, thereby evaluating their merits and demerits. The pursuit review method was to study the impact of a mistake made by a certain fighter or commander on the overall situation from the key point of the battle, in order to clarify tactical responsibilities. Not long ago, when the unit participated in a certain campaign, military democracy was quickly combined with pre-war preparations and developed into military democracy on the front lines. The effect was significant. After receiving the task of attacking a certain city, a battalion of a certain regiment distributed tasks according to the opinions put forward by everyone in the "military democracy" study. The cadres of each company also went to the platoons they were responsible for to solicit opinions, understand the situation, and guide exercises. Before and during the battle, all commanders and fighters actively sought out local people to understand the enemy's situation and fortifications inside and outside the defensive area. Before the assault, various combat experts and commanders personally observed the terrain and conducted research and practice. Finally, through the soldiers' individual discussions of specific tactics and detailed division of labor, combat command was carried out, so that the wisdom of thousands of soldiers was concentrated in the commander, ensuring the victory of the assault action. Qiu Jianli, the deputy political instructor of the 3rd company, collectively drew pictures with the demolition men to study the enemy's fortifications while assaulting the east gate of the city, and completed the task after demolition, without any casualties among the demolition men of the whole company. Before the 5th squad of the 3rd company of a certain regiment attacked the enemy headquarters fortifications, it held a squad meeting to democratically discuss how to adjust the personnel of the combat team and the firepower deployment of the whole squad, and carefully studied the possible situations and ways to deal with difficulties in the battle, and finally successfully completed the task of assault and consolidating the breakthrough. After the campaign, the unit immediately combined post-war work and launched a review and summary of the campaign in the spirit of military democracy. All combat companies universally used large sand table operations for democratic review, not only reviewing one person, one squad, and one task, but also studying the coordination of various actions, the coordination of various arms, and the coordination between superiors and subordinates. At the same time, it also evaluated techniques, evaluated casualties, and accurately discovered the true performance of each commander and fighter in the battle. Those who were heroes, models, meritorious persons, and skilled experts were thus organically combined with the evaluation of merits and selection of models. Some companies, after the sand table operation review, immediately held field exercises based on the specific situation of the review, which greatly helped to improve tactics. The military democracy movement of this unit is still continuing enthusiastically and is gradually becoming popular in all areas of military life.

　　苏鲁豫皖某部开展军事民主
  　战术技术迅速提高
    结合实际战例民主讨论检查
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线五日电】人民解放大军某部在经过土改学习，阶级觉悟空前提高的基础上，继政治民主、经济民主之后，又普遍展开军事民主，充分发挥群众智慧，使军事战术与技术大大提高了一步。该部军事民主开始是与军事学习相结合，接着就和实际战斗战役结合起来。在军事学习中以过去的战斗为实例，各参战单位及各个人均根据当时具体情况与任务，自上而下进行检讨，检查指挥，兵种配合，战术动作，并研究当时敌我双方整个的优缺点，得出经验教训和今后改进的办法。英雄郭继胜连在军事民主学习中，创造了大沙盘作战的民主检查方法，他们将某一次的战斗实际地形工事火力配备等制成大沙盘，全连均可围观，每一参战人员都用小旗做代表，一面讲述战斗经过，一面将小旗按自己当时实际战斗中的位置运动，然后由大家评论，在这次战斗中谁起作用大，谁的动作好。或预先决定要查那个重点，或那个指挥员时，就着重的对那个重点或那个指挥员发表意见，在具体进行检查时，有对比检查法，对比检查法即选择两个战斗小组，在沙盘上比较评论其各种战术动作好坏对照谁优谁劣。反证检查法，是由参加该战斗之解放战士讲述当时在敌方看到我方的战斗动作，与我方情况对照，进行检讨。测量检讨法，为按军事原则标准，测量某一战士或指挥员某一点是否适合要求，是否完成了任务，从而评定其优劣。追究检查法，是从战斗的关键上来研究某一战士或指挥员所犯错误，对全局的影响，以辩明战术责任。不久前该部参加某战役，军事民主即迅速与战前准备工作相结合，并发展为火线上的军事民主。收效很大，某团一营于接受攻击某城的任务后，即根据“军事民主”学习中大家所提的意见分配任务，各连干部并到自己所负责的排去征求意见，了解情况，并指导演习。在战前及战斗中，各指战员均纷纷寻找当地群众，了解敌人防地内外的敌情工事，当突击前，各种战斗专家及指挥员们均亲自观察地形，进行研究与实习，最后通过战士各自讨论的具体战法和详细的分工，进行战斗指挥，使千百个战士的智慧集中于指挥员一身，保证了突击动作的胜利。三连副政指丘建礼在突击该城东门中，与爆破员们集体绘图研究敌人工事，进行爆破完成任务后，全连爆破员无一伤亡。某团三连五班突击敌司令部工事前，召开班务会议，民主讨论如何调整战斗小组的人员及全班的火力配置，并周密的研究了战斗中可能发生的情况与应付困难的办法，终于胜利的完成了突击和巩固突破口的任务。该战役结束后，该部立即结合战后工作以军事民主的精神展开对战役的检讨与总结，各战斗连队均普遍以大沙盘作业民主检查，不仅检讨一个人一个班和一个工作，而且研究各个动作的配合，各兵种的配合和上下的配合。同时也就评定了技术，评定了伤亡，和准确的发现了每一指战员在战斗中的真实表现，那些是英雄模范功臣能手，因此与评功选模也就成了有机的结合。有些连队在沙盘作业检查后，又根据检讨的具体情况，立即举行实地演习，对战术的提高帮助更大。该部军事民主运动现仍在继续热烈开展，并正逐渐向全部军事生活的领域普及中。
