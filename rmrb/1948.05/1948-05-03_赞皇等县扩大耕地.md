　　【Taihang News】According to news from Shexian, Zanhuang, Xingtai, and Xiyang counties, the masses in sixteen villages and one district are actively repairing riverbanks and reclaiming wasteland to expand cultivated land area and increase income. Since the beginning of spring, a total of 1,373 mu of riverbank land has been repaired and wasteland reclaimed. In Liujiazhuang Village, Shexian County, more than 90 mu of riverbank land was repaired last year, and each household harvested at least two dan of rice. This year, the enthusiasm for repairing riverbanks is even greater. Village cadres announced that the newly repaired riverbank land would not be equally distributed, and the grain harvested would not be subject to burdens for three years. After heated discussions, everyone decided to first start building a large dam and digging a large canal to prevent the repaired riverbank land from being flooded again. Within thirteen days, the entire village completed a large dam 168 zhang long, 8 chi wide, and 5 chi high, and many small canals will soon be completed. After the completion of this project, 350 mu of paddy fields will be free from floods, and more than 300 mu of riverbank land can be newly repaired. In addition to working with the mutual aid group, poor peasant Jia Suixin also spent time repairing 1.5 mu of land on his own. The masses in Tanli Village also established a riverbank repair committee to rush the repair of paddy fields that had been washed away in the past four or five years.

　　赞皇等县扩大耕地
    【太行消息】据涉县、赞皇、邢台、昔阳等四县消息，有十六个村又一个区的群众，现正积极修滩、开生荒扩大耕地面积，增加收入。入春以来共修出滩地开出生荒已有一千三百七十三亩。涉县刘家庄村，去年修出滩地九十余亩，每户最少收了两石子稻，今年修滩的劲头更大了。村干宣布新修的滩地保证不平分，收的粮食三年不出负担。后经大家的热烈讨论，决定首先动工扎一条大堰，开一道大渠，以防修好的滩地再受水淹。全村十三天内，完成了一道长达一百六十八丈，宽八尺、高五尺的大堰，四百五十丈的大渠及许多小渠不久也可完成。此项工程告成后，有三百五十亩水田免去水患，并能增修三百余亩滩地。贫农贾随心除和互助组修外，自己又抽功夫修了一亩五分。滩里村群众也成立了修滩委员会，抢修四五年冲了的水田。
