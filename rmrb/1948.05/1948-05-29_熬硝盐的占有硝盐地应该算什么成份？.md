　　To the Editor:

　　In preparation for implementing allocation and replenishment, I have a question to ask.

　　In our urban area, there are four or five hundred households engaged in making nitre salt. They rely on the income from their respective nitre salt fields for their livelihood. If making nitre salt is considered agriculture, the tools used are not agricultural implements, and the product is a mineral, not an agricultural crop. Furthermore, their labor methods are different from those of farmers. If they are considered handicrafts, their main means of production is land (salt fields), and we cannot come to a clear conclusion. If they are considered handicrafts, even if they own a large amount of salt fields and employ some workers, they cannot be touched during allocation and replenishment. If they are considered agriculture, allocation and replenishment must be carried out in accordance with rural principles. Therefore, we would like to ask what class this nitre salt production should be classified as.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　From Puyang County, Chengguan District, Puyang County:

　　Those who boil nitre salt, who possess a small amount of tools or raw materials and engage in independent handicraft labor as their entire or main source of livelihood, are handicraft laborers. Handicraft laborers generally do not employ workers; they participate in the main labor themselves and also recruit a small number of apprentices or assistants for learning purposes; if their own labor is still their main source of livelihood, they should still be considered handicraft laborers. If they recruit a large number of apprentices and workers, which constitute the main part of their production, and they themselves only provide incidental labor or are in a supervisory position, then they should be considered handicraft capitalists. Those who own land and boil nitre salt in rural areas should be judged based on their main source of livelihood, according to the specific circumstances as a standard for class division. If boiling nitre salt is their main source of livelihood, then they are handicraft laborers. They should not be classified as landlords or rich peasants simply because they own nitre salt fields; if their main income comes from employing workers, then they are handicraft capitalists.

### 熬硝盐的占有硝盐地应该算什么成份？

　　熬硝盐的占有硝盐地应该算什么成份？编者同志：
    为了准备实行抽补，有一个问题请回答。
    在我们城区里有四五百户做硝盐的，他们依靠各人硝盐地的收入过生活，若说做硝盐属于农业，使用的工具不是农具，生产物是矿物质，不是农作物。且他们的劳动方式和农民的也不同。若说他们属于手工业，他们的主要生产资料是土地（盐地），我们辩论不清。若是属于手工业，即便占有多量盐地，用些雇工，抽补时就不能动了。若是属于农业，就须依照农村抽补原则进行抽补。所以这种硝盐生产究属何种成份，请示复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　濮阳县城关区濮阳县城关区：
    熬硝盐者，是占有少量的工具，或占有少量的原料，以从事独立的手工业劳动，作为其全部或主要生活来源的人们，即是手工业劳动者。手工业劳动者一般不用雇工，其本人参加主要劳动，同时又招收少数学习性质或助手性质的学徒，或工人；但仍以本人劳动为主要生活来源者，仍应认为手工业劳动者。如果招收多数学徒和工人等，做为其生产中之主体，本人只有附带劳动，或居于监督管理地位，则应认为手工业资本家。农村中占有土地的熬硝盐者，应看他主要生活来源是什么，按具体情况做为划阶级标准。如果以熬硝盐为主要生活来源，即是手工业劳动者。不能看他占有硝盐地而订成地主富农；如果以雇佣工人劳动为主要收入，则是手工业资本家。　　　　　　　　　　——编者
