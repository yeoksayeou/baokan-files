　　Jinan Bank
　　Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank
　　General Office Announcement

　　It has been found that during the Anti-Japanese War period, the Luxi Bank banknotes were issued in our Northwest Shandong area and were uniformly circulated in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In order to unify the currency and facilitate merchants and the people, it was announced in July of last year that the banknotes would be recalled at an equivalent value to the Ji banknotes within six months. It has now been found that a small number of these banknotes are still circulating in the market. Therefore, it is hereby announced again to merchants and the people that those who hold Luxi Bank banknotes should quickly exchange them at the local Jinan Bank or Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank (at a rate of one to one with Ji banknotes and one to ten with border region banknotes) in order to recall them as soon as possible. This is hereby announced.

  　总行通告
    查抗日时期我鲁西北地区曾发行鲁西银行钞票，于抗日胜利后统一流通于晋冀鲁豫地区。为了统一货币，便利商民，曾于去年七月间公布限六个月以冀钞等值收回。兹查此项钞票尚有少数流通市面，为此特再通告商民凡持有鲁西银行之钞票者，希速向当地之冀南银行或晋察冀边区银行兑换（对冀钞一比一、对边钞一比十），以便早日收回。特此通告
