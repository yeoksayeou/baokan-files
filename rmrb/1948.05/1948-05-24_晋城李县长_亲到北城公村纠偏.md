　　【Taiyue News】After Beicheng Gong Village in Jincheng thoroughly corrected its "leftist" deviations, everyone was able to focus on production. During the first month of the lunar year, the village head, Shao Sangou, and others, fearing exposure of their mistakes, deliberately organized poor peasant and hired laborer groups. Old hired laborer Yin Chengbao, seeing through this trick, refused to participate. Shao Sangou then cursed him, saying, "You are not a true poor peasant and hired laborer, you are disrupting the liberation of poor peasants and hired laborers in Beicheng Gong Village," and beat him up. This intimidated other poor peasants and hired laborers into joining. In this way, they brought together fifty-eight households, forming a poor peasant group, and immediately forcibly borrowed three dan and seven dou of wheat, along with other grains, from thirty-one middle peasant households. They even took out the seventeen sheep of old shepherd Huang Quhai to "provide relief." They also evicted and confiscated most of the property of eight landlord and rich peasant families, as well as the seven middle peasant families who had served as puppet village heads, and occupied their houses. When distributing the goods, those who were on good terms with the cadres received more, causing chaos in the village. In April, district cadres went to resolve the issue, but they only returned some grain to the middle peasants, so the middle peasants remained fearful. Middle peasant Liu Zhenyi, who had more than ninety cartloads of manure, stopped delivering it to the fields and carelessly planted eight mu of millet and cotton. On May 3rd, County Magistrate Li personally went to resolve the issue. He connected with the actual situation in the village, explained the policy of consolidating unity with the middle peasants, and criticized the misdeeds of village head Shao Sangou and others on the spot. He also pointed out to the cadres that only by acknowledging and correcting their mistakes could they be forgiven by the masses. He also asked the masses to discuss these issues, so that they could recognize that infringing upon the interests of the middle peasants was wrong and that the losses of the middle peasants should be returned and compensated. Yin Chengbao said, "He is harming us poor peasants and hired laborers, making us poor peasants and hired laborers eat poison, making us peasants fight an 'internal war.' Now we must all withdraw." Everyone decided to return all the houses and belongings of the middle peasants, and to compensate the middle peasants with over seventy sheep from the public harvest and grain. The labels of "struggle target" placed on the middle peasants were to be removed, and everyone was finally relieved. Immediately, some people began carrying water to irrigate the seedlings and delivering manure to the fields.

　　晋城李县长
  　亲到北城公村纠偏
    【太岳消息】晋城北城公村彻底纠正左倾偏向后，大家才安心生产。正月间村长邵三狗等怕暴露自己错误，故意组织贫雇小组，老雇工尹成保看透了这鬼计不愿参加，邵三狗就骂他“不是真正贫雇，捣乱不叫北城公村贫雇翻身”，就把他打了一顿，吓的其他贫雇不敢不参加。就这样弄了五十八户，成立了一个贫农小组，一下就向卅一家中农强借了麦子三石七斗，还有其他粮食，还把老羊工黄区孩的十七只羊也拿出来“救济了”。又扫地出门没收了八家地主富农和当过伪闾长的七家中农的大部财产，又占了房。在分东西时和干部好的多分，这样村里闹得乱动动的。四月中区干部去解决了一次，可是单单给中农退了一些粮食，所以中农还是害怕。中农刘振义有九十多车粪就不往地送，马虎种了八亩谷和棉花。五月三日李县长亲自去解决，联系村中实际，讲明巩固联合中农的政策，当场批评了胡作非为的村长邵三狗等，并给干部指出只有知错改错群众才能原谅，又叫群众讨论了这些问题，让群众认识了侵犯中农是错误的，应当退还与补偿中农的损失。尹成保说：“他这是害我们贫雇，叫我们贫雇吃毒药，叫我们农民打‘内战’，现在我们一定要全部退出。”大家决定了把中农的房子东西全部退出，把公共果实里的七十多只羊补偿中农粮食，已分的能拿出就拿，拿不出的另从果实里想办法。给中农戴了的斗争对象帽子都要摘下，大家才安下心来，马上就有人担水灌茅往地送粪。
