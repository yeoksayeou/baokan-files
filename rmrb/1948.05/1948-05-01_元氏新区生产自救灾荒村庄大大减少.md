[Yuanshi News] After forty days of production and famine relief in this county, considerable results have been achieved. More than 25,000 disaster victims have been organized and supported in production activities such as spinning, dam construction, sideline occupations, and trading through loans (95 million yuan), grain loans (200,000 jin of grain), relief bran (286,000 jin), and vegetables (70,000 jin). The government also allocated 15,000 jin of early-maturing crop seeds such as sorghum, small corn, and bean seeds, and 5,400 jin of cotton seeds, so that disaster victims could also plant crops. According to incomplete statistics, in the four districts of Si, Wu, Liu, Qi, and Chengguan, there are approximately 25,000 spinning wheels, of which two-thirds are now in operation, about 16,600. They can spin 5,200 jin per day; at 500 yuan per jin, they can earn 2.6 million yuan. In Sizhuang Village in the Fourth District, with 500 households, an average of more than 200 bolts of cloth are produced per day, and with spinning added, a profit of 300,000 yuan can be made each day. In Zheng Village in the Fifth District, with 150 households, 100 bolts of cloth are produced per day, earning 100,000 yuan. Zhang Laoheng, a middle peasant in Fucun Village in the Sixth District, with a family of seven and 14 mu of land, had sold all his furniture due to enemy conscription. After the New Year, he often begged for food, and his family didn't have a fire for five consecutive days, and they were constantly arguing. This time, he received a loan of 10,000 yuan and 70 jin of grain. His mother and wife spun cotton, and the money earned in five days was enough to buy a small dou of sorghum. He plans to eat the 70 jin of loaned grain this month, and next month he will be able to eat what he earns this month, so eating until the wheat harvest will not be a problem. His family is no longer arguing. He has also planted the 14 mu of land. The masses were also organized to transport rice from Zanhuang to Huolu, a total of 800,000 jin for the entire county, earning a total of 35 million yuan. One-third of them are doing round-trip foot transport, which can earn more than 11 million yuan, enough to buy 340,000 jin of grain. The original twelve disaster-stricken villages in the First and Second Districts have been reduced to five villages through production and self-relief.
    
[Xingtai News] Qianliuzhuang and Wuzhong villages in the Third District are seriously affected by famine. In addition to lending the villagers the stored grain and the government's loan grain, the villages have recently promoted the villagers' skilled leather tanning techniques to actively engage in production for self-relief. The men and women of Qianliuzhuang have always been skilled in tanning sheepskin and making leather jackets, but they lacked capital to do so. The village cadres went to Xingtai City and contracted to process 3,000 black and white sheepskins for the Trading Company, and another 1,000 white sheepskins for Jinji Goods Store, a total of 4,000. Each skin, after deducting 522 yuan for materials such as yellow rice, leather nitrate, soap beans, and purple x, can earn a net manual labor fee of 477 yuan, totaling 1.91 million yuan. Now, the poor and middle peasants of the whole village have truly voluntarily formed eight groups, with 73 workers, who are dividing the work according to labor and technology, "whoever puts in the rice, eats the porridge," in a mutually beneficial way. When the work is tight, they cook and eat together; when the work is relaxed, they eat at home. With the help of the cooperative, Wuzhong Village also contracted to process 3,000 white sheepskins for the Xingtai City Trading Company, earning a net profit of 1.65 million yuan after deducting the cost of leather tanning materials. Seventy-two people have voluntarily joined together. Now, the leather tanning workers in both villages have started working. Everyone happily said, "Our villages have always eaten sheepskin and worn wool, and we can't live without wool." With this, they are not afraid of the famine before the wheat harvest.

　　元氏新区生产自救灾荒村庄大大减少
    【元氏消息】本县经过四十天的生产渡荒，已收到相当成绩。二万五千多灾民，经过贷款（九千五百万元）、贷粮（二十万斤谷），救济糠（二十八万六千斤）、菜（七万斤），组织与扶持了灾民纺织、扑坎、副业、贩卖等生产。政府又调剂早熟庄稼种子高粱、小玉茭、豆种一万五千斤，棉花种五千四百斤，使灾民也能下种。据不完全统计，四、五、六、七、城关五个区约有纺车二万五千辆，现已有三分之二动起来，约一万六千六百辆。每天能纺五千二百斤；每斤以五百元计，能赚二百六十万元。四区五百户的使庄村，一天平均出二百多匹布，再加上纺花，每天能得利三十万元。五区正村一百五十户，每天出布一百匹，可赚十万元。六区富村中农张老恒，七口人，十四亩地，因敌人强征，曾把家具卖光，过年后经常要饭吃，一次连着五天没起火，家里整天生气不和。这次贷款一万元，粮七十斤，母亲和妻子纺花，五天赚的钱可买一小斗高粱。他计划这一个月先吃贷的七十斤粮，下月即可吃这个月赚的，吃到麦收不成问题。家里也不生气了。十四亩地也种上了。又组织群众从赞皇往获鹿运米，全县运八十万斤，共赚三千五百万元。其中有三分之一搞来回脚，可赚一千一百多万元，共可买粮三十四万斤。一、二区原来十二个灾荒村，经过生产自救，灾区已缩小到五个村。

    【邢台消息】三区前留庄、伍仲两村灾荒严重，村里除将存的一部果实粮和政府贷粮借给灾民外，近又发扬村民熟皮老手艺，积极生产自救。前留庄男女历来就会熟羊皮，做皮袄，但没本钱，干不起，村干部便到邢台市揽做了贸易公司黑白羊皮三千张，又揽了金记货栈白皮一千张，共四千张。每张除用黄米、皮硝、皂角、紫×等材料五百二十二元外，可净赚手工钱四百七十七元，总共可赚一百九十一万元。现在全村贫雇中农已真正自愿的结合起八个小组，七十三个工人，是按劳力折分，按技术“谁下米，谁吃粥”，互不吃亏的办法分红。活紧时在一块起火吃饭，活松时在家吃饭。伍仲村在合作社帮助下，也到邢台市贸易公司揽了三千张白羊皮，除去熟皮材料钱，共可净赚一百六十五万元。自愿结合起来七十二个人。现在两村熟皮工人已经开始工作。大家高兴的说：“咱村向来就是吃羊皮，穿羊毛，离了羊毛过不了。”这一下，麦前的灾荒就不怕了。（赵增韦）
