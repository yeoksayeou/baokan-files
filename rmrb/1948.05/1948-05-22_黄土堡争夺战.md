　　Battle for Huangtubao
    Wei Jin
    Huangtubao is the only high ground outside the eastern gate of Linfen. It is only a hundred meters away from the eastern gate and is also an important breakthrough point for the People's Liberation Army to seize the eastern gate. The defending enemy, the Sixth Company of the Second Battalion of the 198th Regiment of Yan Xishan's 66th Division, relied on the solid fortifications here, with Japanese instructors Koichi Narui and Kiyoshi Toda directing the battle, and fire support from the city walls, thinking they could hold it. However, on the night of March 15th, after the 1313th Unit of the People's Liberation Army launched a general attack, the sharpshooter blasted a hole two or three meters wide in the solid main bunker with four shells, and destroyed the bunker's loopholes with one shell. Then, with accurate and dense artillery fire, they completely suppressed the enemy's firepower on the city wall. The enemy troops in Huangtubao were stunned. The Japanese instructors were also frightened and lost their composure. The soldiers scrambled from the main bunker to the pillbox, and from the pillbox to the outer cave dwellings along the outer moat. However, this last line of defense failed to save the enemy from being annihilated. When the artillery fire opened the way for the assault, the assault heroes of our Fifth Company immediately broke through various obstacles and stormed Huangtubao. Hand grenades and explosive packs were accurately and continuously thrown into the enemy's last line of defense—small cave dwellings. The enemy troops were unable to retreat in time and were mostly blasted into a state of being charred and completely lost their ability to resist. The two Japanese instructors became commanders who surrendered. They crawled out of the pool of blood and led the soldiers to kowtow to the People's Liberation Army and beg for mercy. In this way, an enemy company was annihilated.
    The next day, the enemy counterattacked and occupied Huangtubao again. But before they had time to repair the fortifications, our Second and Third Platoons of heroic soldiers, under the cover of artillery fire, charged up along the outer moat that had been blasted into a slope the day before in just over ten minutes. This kind of bravery caught the enemy by surprise, and the enemy inhumanly released poison gas. The soldiers' eyes were filled with tears, coughing and vomiting, but they still disregarded everything, covering their noses with one hand and throwing grenades with the other, rushing straight up. The entire Huangtubao was stained red with fire and blood. The enemy desperately shouted: "Hold the fort firmly!" But what use was shouting when even poison gas couldn't stop them? The enemy rolled and crawled from the secret passage back to the eastern gate. The enemy was not reconciled and launched six counterattacks under the cover of fierce artillery fire, but they were all defeated. In desperation, the enemy shouted in the air above the city: "Tomorrow we will send fifty planes to destroy Huangtubao." The soldiers replied with a sneer: "Even if your foreign daddy sends five hundred planes, it won't matter! Huangtubao belongs to the people now!"

　　黄土堡争夺战
    维进
    黄土堡是临汾东关外围唯一的制高点。距东关百余米达，也是解放军争取东关的重要突破点。守敌阎匪军六六师一九八团二营六连，依靠这里有坚固的工事，有日籍教官成井幸作、唐田清指挥作战，有城垣火力支援，以为很可以守得住了。但是，三月十五日晚，解放军一三一三部发起总攻后，神炮手四炮就把坚固的主碉轰穿二三米突宽一个洞口，一炮就摧毁了地堡的枪眼。接着以准确密集的炮火把城垣敌人的火力完全压倒。黄土堡的匪军，被震荡得昏迷了。日籍教官也吓得没了主张。士兵狼狈地从主碉爬到地堡，又从地堡爬到外壕内沿的外窑洞。但是，这最后一道防线也未能拯救匪军覆没的命运。当炮火打开冲锋道路时，我五连突击勇士立即突破各种障碍，攻上黄土堡。手榴弹、炸药包，准确连续地投进匪军最后防线——小窑洞。匪军来不及退出，就大部被炸得焦头烂额，完全失去抵抗力了。两个日籍教官变成投降的指挥者，他们从血泊中爬起来，领着士兵向解放军磕头求饶。敌人的一个连，就这样被歼灭了。
    第二天，敌人反扑，又把黄土堡占去。但他还没来得及修好工事，我二、三排英勇健儿又在炮火掩护下，沿着前天被爆破成斜坡的外壕，十余分钟就冲上去。这样勇猛出乎敌人意料，敌人竟灭绝人性的放出毒瓦斯。战士们两眼流泪，咳嗽作呕，但仍不顾一切，一手掩住鼻子，一手摔出手榴弹，直冲上去，整个黄土堡被火血染红了。敌人拼命的叫喊：“坚决守住堡呀！”但是，毒瓦斯尚且挡不住，叫喊有什么用呢？敌人连爬带滚，从暗道滚回东关去了。敌人不死心，又在猛烈炮火掩护下进行了六次反扑，但都被打垮。绝望的敌人在城上空喊：“明天派上五十架飞机炸毁黄土堡。”战士们冷笑着回答：“哪怕请你洋爸爸派上五百架也不算话！黄土堡是属于人民的了”！
