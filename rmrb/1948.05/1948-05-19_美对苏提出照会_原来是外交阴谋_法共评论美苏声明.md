　　U.S. Lodges Note with USSR
    Originally a Diplomatic Conspiracy
  　French Communist Party Comments on U.S.-Soviet Statement
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Paris dispatch: The French people attach great importance to the U.S.-Soviet notes. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party held a meeting on the 13th, presided over by General Secretary Thorez, to discuss the international situation related to the U.S.-Soviet notes, and praised Molotov's reply to the U.S. statement as a significant contribution to the cause of defending peace. L'Humanité observer Coude wrote in a commentary on Marshall's statement: "The firmness of Soviet policy has led to the publication of the U.S. note, and this publication has frightened the Secretary of State. That is the truth." Coude believes that this U.S. note did not go beyond the scope of a combination of diplomatic conspiracy and campaign tactics. "Marshall had hoped that Molotov would not answer, and Truman's subordinates could then tell American citizens who were anxious about the situation endangering peace: 'You see, the U.S. Ambassador has sent a note to the Soviet government seeking to resolve the differences between the two countries, hasn't he?' Then this note could be used as a basic argument against Wallace and those advocating peace, and the blame for refusing negotiations could be placed on the Soviet Union."

　　美对苏提出照会
    原来是外交阴谋
  　法共评论美苏声明
    【新华社陕北十七日电】巴黎讯：法国人民极端重视美苏照会。法共政治局十三日在总书记多列士主持下举行会议，讨论与美苏照会有关的国际局势，并赞扬莫洛托夫对美国声明的复文，为对保卫和平事业的重大贡献。人道报观察家库达德于评马歇尔声明时写道：“苏联政策的坚定性，使得美方照会被公布了，而这一公布，吓慌了国务卿，事实的真相便是如此。”库达德认为：这一次美方照会并未超过外交阴谋与竞选策略结合的范围，“马歇尔原曾希望莫洛托夫不会作答，而杜鲁门部下便可以告诉对危及和平的局势感到焦虑的美国公民说：‘你们看美大使不是曾对苏政府递过照会以求解决两国间的分歧吗？’然后这一照会便可以作为反对华莱士及主张和平方面的基本论据，并且把拒绝谈判的责难加到苏联身上。”
