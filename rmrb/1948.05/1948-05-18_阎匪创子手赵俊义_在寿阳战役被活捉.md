Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th: Frontline reporters report: In this military adventure where the Yan bandit Shouyang acted like moths to a flame, they not only lost 2,000 soldiers, but also lost Zhao Junyi, a "creativity hand" whom the Yan bandit was proud of. Zhao had created the so-called "Junyi Struggle Method" which was a brutal massacre of the people. The content of his "struggle" included so-called "water-flooding military offensives," "river-collapse-style advancement of political power," and "full-sky-star-like special agent organizations," etc. Last January, on the dozens of miles of road from Shouyang to Jiechou Town, Zhao used a铡刀 (a type of guillotine) to slaughter 120 good people. This insane, dehumanizing, brutal act was greatly appreciated by the Yan bandit, who promoted Zhao from regiment commander to deputy division commander. The so-called "Zhao Junyi Movement" was immediately promoted, creating a "no-man's land" in the dozens of miles close to the liberated areas to constitute their "surface control," and adopting the Japanese invaders' three-all policy of burning, killing, and looting. However, under the iron fist of the people's justice, Zhao Junyi himself only "struggled" less than three times before ending his fate. The first time was during the Zhengtai Campaign last year, when his first battalion was completely annihilated by us in Meng County; the second time was last October, when his regiment's direct unit and the second and third battalions were completely annihilated by us in Zongai, and he himself escaped because he went to Taiyuan; the third time was in this battle of North and South Shangshe, not only was his re-pieced-together first regiment once again mostly annihilated, but he himself was also taken prisoner.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Frontline, 15th: The Zhengtai Frontline Command of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army recently announced the battle results of the battles of Dongxi Guocun and North and South Shangshe north of Shouyang on the 9th of this month, stating: The battle started at 15:00 on the 9th and ended at 19:00, killing and wounding 724 Yan bandits, including Wang Zejin, Major General Chief of Staff of the Yan Bandit's Provisional 49th Division, and Yang Zhixiang, Colonel Commander of the 3rd Regiment, and capturing 1,215 Yan bandits, including Zhang Ji, Lieutenant General Deputy Commander of the Yan Bandit's 34th Army and Commander of the Provisional 49th Division, Zhao Junyi, Major General Deputy Commander of the Division and Commander of the 1st Regiment, Zhang Xuanjin, Colonel Deputy Commander of the 1st Regiment, and Wen Baoshou, Major Adjutant of the 3rd Regiment, etc. A mountain gun, five mortars, 101 light and heavy machine guns, 54 grenade launchers, 10 submachine guns, 662 rifles and carbines, four rifle grenade launchers, more than 50,000 rounds of various ammunition, five radios, and many other military supplies were seized.

　　阎匪创子手赵俊义
    在寿阳战役被活捉
    【新华社晋察冀十六日电】前线记者报导：这次寿阳阎匪在灯蛾扑火的军事冒险中不仅损兵折将二千人，还赔了一个阎匪得意的创子手赵俊义。赵曾创造了残暴屠杀人民的所谓“俊义奋斗法”。其“奋斗”内容有所谓“水漫式的军事进攻”、“河塌式的推进政权”、“满天星的特务组织”等等。去年一月赵即从寿阳到解愁镇几十里的路上，用铡刀屠杀了一百二十个善良的人民。这种疯狂的灭绝人性的残暴兽行，大为阎匪赏识，当将赵由团长提升为副师长。并即推行所谓“赵俊义运动”，在接近解放区几十里的地带制造“无人区”，以构成其“面的控制”，并采用日寇烧杀抢的三光政策。但是在人民正义的铁掌之下，赵俊义自己只“奋斗”了不到三次，就结束了他的命运。第一次是去年正太战役，他的第一营在孟县被我全部歼灭；第二次是去年十月他的团直属队及第二第三两营在宗艾又被我全部歼灭，他本人因赴太原得以身免；第三次就是这次南北上社战斗，不仅其重新拼凑之第一团再度大部被歼，他本人也做了俘虏。
    【新华社晋察冀前线十五日电】晋察冀人民解放军正太前线指挥部顷公布本月九日寿阳以北东西郭村、南北上社战斗之战果称：战斗自九日十五时开始，至十九时结束，计毙伤阎匪暂编第四十九师少将参谋长王泽晋，第三团上校团长杨致祥以下七二四名，俘阎匪第三十四军中将副军长兼暂编第四十九师师长张冀，该师少将副师长兼第一团团长赵俊义，第一团上校副团长张轩晋，第三团少校团附文保寿等以下一、二一五名。缴获山炮一门，迫击炮五门，轻重机枪一○一挺，掷弹筒五十四个，冲锋枪十挺，长短枪六六二支，枪榴弹筒四个，各种弹药五万余发，电台五部及其他军用品甚多。
