Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Guangzhou, 6th – Japanese goods are now flooding the market here, just as they did before the war. There are hundreds of kinds of Japanese goods on the market, mainly including hardware products, fabrics, silk, woolens, daily necessities, toys, rubber products, seafood, industrial raw materials, and stationery.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Nanjing Dispatch: The Chiang bandits decided in mid-month to have the Central Trust Bureau of the Four Big Families monopolize Chiang-Japanese trade. The bureau has now drawn up the first list of goods to be exported to Japan. Apart from the iron ore from Hainan Island, which has already been continuously shipped to Japan, it includes 50,000 tons each of edible salt and soybean cake, 20,000 tons of soybeans, 5,000 tons of soybean oil, 3,000 tons of peanuts, and 1,000 tons each of livestock and pig bristles, implementing a barter system to exchange for counter-revolutionary civil war materials. Among them, 10,000 tons of Taiwanese salt will be shipped to Japan within this month.
