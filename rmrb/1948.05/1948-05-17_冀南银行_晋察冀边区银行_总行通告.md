　　Jinan Bank
    Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank
    General Office Notice

　　It has been found that during the Anti-Japanese War, the Luxi Bank notes were issued in the Northwest Shandong area and were unified for circulation in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In order to unify the currency and facilitate merchants and the people, it was announced in July of last year that they would be withdrawn at par with the Ji banknotes within six months. It is now found that there are still a few of these banknotes circulating in the market. Therefore, a special notice is hereby given to merchants and the people holding Luxi Bank notes, hoping that they will quickly exchange them at the local Jinan Bank or Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank (at a ratio of one to one for Ji banknotes and one to ten for Border Region banknotes) so that they can be withdrawn as soon as possible. This is hereby announced.

    晋察冀边区银行
    总行通告
    查抗日时期我鲁西北地区曾发行鲁西银行钞票，于抗日胜利后统一流通于晋冀鲁豫地区。为了统一货币，便利商民，曾于去年七月间公布限六个月以冀钞等值收回。兹查此项钞票尚有少数流通市面，为此特再通告商民凡持有鲁西银行之钞票者，希速向当地之冀南银行或晋察冀边区银行兑换（对冀钞一比一、对边钞一比十），以便早日收回。特此通告
