　　On the Train in Eastern Manchuria
　　From Tumen to Harbin, the train ride takes a day and a night. The train doesn't go directly; you have to change trains in Mudanjiang.

　　Sitting on our own People's train in the Liberated Area, is a first for us travelers from the Liberated Areas within the Passes. When we stepped onto the platform through the station's waiting room, we felt indescribably happy.

　　From the station, the train, the water tower, the tracks, the roadbed, all the way to the endless telegraph poles extending along the railway, we saw no traces of war. Although the Japanese invaders put up fierce resistance against the Red Army in the Mudanjiang area when they announced their surrender in the autumn of 1945, and systematically carried out serious destruction in many places before retreating, these war wounds and the Japanese invaders' criminal damage left on the railway have been healed by the efforts of the people of the Northeast Liberated Area for nearly two years.

　　Our locomotive and carriages are scrubbed very clean, and the train is very well equipped. Each carriage is equipped with electric lights and running water. The train we took even had sleeping cars and dining cars. When we went to eat in the dining car, if it weren't for the rumbling of the train wheels on the rails, we would have thought we were sitting in a long restaurant. Here, between each large glass window, were embedded excellent oil paintings, stylish lamps, and electric fans, but on each shiny, vermilion-painted table by the window, there were displays of blooming hydrangeas. The train arrived at the station on time. Railway personnel wearing red armbands constantly swept the dust and fruit peels in each carriage, reported the train's schedule and station names, kindly mediated disputes caused by rural passengers vying for seats, and humbly solicited passengers' criticism of the railway service. They are carrying out a heated labor competition, and huge colored publicity signs are hung on the outside of the carriages, on which their competition covenants are drawn or written in the rough handwriting of the workers. At some stations, when the train is parked side by side with another train, they point to those competition covenants to each other with their partners on the opposite train, enthusiastically raising their sweat-stained hands, because it is difficult to encourage each other to move forward with words in the noisy station.

　　At a small station west of Mudanjiang, we saw the "Zhu De" locomotive, which we had admired for a long time within the Passes. It was loudly spouting white steam, dragging a long string of carriages, brushing past our train, panting into the station, and stopping next to us side by side. This is a brand-new locomotive painted with dark paint. Some metal parts that have just left the factory still retain the luster that has been honed in the hands of the assembly workers. In the center of the locomotive is a huge bronze photograph of Comrade Zhu De. The three large bronze characters "Zhu De Hao" shimmered with golden light in the clear summer morning sun through the steam spewed by the locomotive. The driver is a young man under twenty years old. From our train window, he was wiping the coal dust and large beads of sweat from his face. Beside the position where he stood, hung a document that seemed to be a labor covenant or something similar. This locomotive is a product of the Harbin Railway Factory. The workers there have launched two labor model movements since "May Day" last year. From January to early July, output increased five to six times, and 24 special-class models, 56 first-class and second-class labor models, and 250 labor models appeared. This locomotive is an honorary gift assembled by the factory's workers with the best materials to commemorate the "May Day" Labor Day.

　　From the Northeast Daily, we learned that the achievements of railway construction in the Northeast Liberated Area in the past year (June 1946 to June 1947) are very considerable: Under the General Bureau, there are already three bureaus in Harbin, Qiqihar, and Mudanjiang. The length of the officially opened railway line is 6,611 kilometers, accounting for 69.6% of the total length of the Northeast railway line (including the KMT-controlled area). The newly recovered railway line accounts for 15.6% of it; Locomotives: If June 1946 is taken as 100, it is now (June 1947) 806; Carriages: If July 1945 is taken as 100, it is now (June 1947) 269 (according to the above two items, both are indexes); Number of trains: 112 in January 1947, 342 in June, and 387 at the end of July; In the past, the speed of the car was 30 kilometers per hour, but in June it increased to 50 kilometers per hour, and the phenomenon of delays has also been greatly reduced. Regarding the management of the railway, there were initially two different views: one was that railway management was technical and that an old set of management methods should be used; the other was that technology serves politics, emphasizing the combination of the mass line and administrative management. As a result, the second policy was implemented, and the workers became the masters of the house. Relying on the workers, the bad guys were cleared out. For the old employees, their future was pointed out: only by looking downward, changing their ideology and work style, and establishing a new outlook on life can they truly serve the people. Under this construction policy, the strength of the vast workers was brought into play, and the railway completely changed its face. Workers sometimes worked automatically for 16 hours a day. In the past, each person replaced eight sleepers every day, but now each person has reached 38. The materials automatically donated by the workers are worth 10,000 to 20,000 yuan at each station. The consciousness of railway workers has been generally improved. The number of trade union members has reached 40,000, and the number of worker armed self-defense forces has reached 1,600. They guaranteed the transportation tasks of the front line, guaranteed the agility of traffic between vast urban and rural areas, and also guaranteed the order of railway management. In one year, they have cleaned up 2,000 special agents and bad elements who infiltrated the people's railway cause to carry out destructive activities. Knowing that there is such a new type of construction management policy, and having such a strong team of conscious worker brothers, we, a group of travelers from the Liberated Areas within the Passes, have found a definite answer to why the railway industry in the Northeast Liberated Area has been able to recover rapidly and become increasingly perfect.

　　I sat in my seat, leaning against the bright large glass window, watching the endless mountains, forests, and fertile fields of the Eastern Manchuria area that flowed past the car. Suddenly, I seemed to feel for the first time that our Liberated Area was so vast and rich. Of course, I knew this before, but I always abstractly understood this fact from the map, and it was never as intimate as it is now; now - on a certain day in the summer of 1947, I am passing through the materially rich and scenic Eastern Manchuria. Countless villages and cities slide past us, we have to take the train for a day and a night, however, the road ahead is still very long!

### 在东满的火车上

　　在东满的火车上
    从图门到哈尔滨，坐火车是一天一夜的时间。这段路的火车不是直达的，中间，在牡丹江要换一次车。
    坐在我们解放区人民自己的火车上，对于我们这群自关内解放区来的旅客，还是第一次。我们穿过车站的候车室，一步踏上月台的时候，真有说不出的快乐。
    从车站、列车、水塔、铁轨、路基，一直到沿铁路延伸无际的电杆，我们没有看出什么战争的遗痕，虽然，当一九四五年秋季日寇宣布投降时，曾在牡丹江一带，对红军进行过激烈的抵抗，日寇并在撤退之前，有计划的在许多地方进行了严重的破坏，但经过东北解放区人民将近两年来的努力，这些遗留在铁路上的战争创伤和日寇的罪恶的毁坏，已经平复了。
    我们的车头和车厢，刷洗得非常清洁，列车的装配也很完备。每个车厢都装有电灯和自来水，我们搭的那列车上，并且有卧车，有餐车，当到餐车里去吃饭时，如果不是因为车辆滑过铁轨的隆隆声，真会疑心是坐在一个长长的餐厅里；这里在每一个宽大的玻璃窗之间，都镶有很好的油画，有式样华美的电灯，有电扇，但每一张漆着朱红油漆的光亮的餐桌上，靠窗都陈设着盛开的绣球花。火车到站的时间，都很准确。戴着红袖章的车务人员，不断的在每个车厢里清扫着灰尘和果皮，报告车行的时间和站名，和善的调解着乡下乘客们因争夺座位而引起的纠纷，并且谦逊的征求着乘客对于车务的批评。他们正开展着火热的劳动竞赛，在车厢外面的车皮上，挂着巨大的彩色宣传牌，上面用工人的粗大笔迹，画着或者写着他们的竞赛公约。在有一些站上，当列车与另外一列车并排的停着时，他们和对面车上的伙伴们相互指着那些竞赛公约，热情的撑着染满汗垢的手，因为在喧嚣的车站上，用言语来相互鼓励前进是很困难的。
    在牡丹江西面的一个小站上，我们看见了在关内久仰其名的“朱德号”车头。它正大声的喷着白色的水汽，拖着一长串车厢，擦过我们的列车，喘喘地奔进站来，并排的停在我们旁边。这是一个漆着暗色油漆的崭新的机车，若干刚出厂的金属零件，依然保持着在装配工人手中琢磨出来的光彩，而在车头的正中，嵌着一幅巨大的朱德同志的铜质照片，下面“朱德号”三个铜铸的大字，透过车头喷出的蒸汽，在晴朗的夏天的朝阳中闪着金色的光。司机是一位不满二十岁的青年，从我们的车窗里看去，他正在抹去满脸的煤屑和大颗的汗珠，在他站的位子的旁边，就挂着一张似乎是劳动公约之类的文告。这个机车，是哈尔滨铁道工厂的出品。那里的工人，在去年“五一”以后，已经开展了两次劳模运动。自一月至七月初，产量提高了五倍至六倍，出现了二十四位特等模范，五十六位甲、乙等劳动模范和二百五十位劳动模范。这个机车，就是该厂工人为了纪念“五一”劳动节，选用最好的材料装配的荣誉献礼。
    从东北日报上，我们知道东北解放区一年来（一九四六年六月至一九四七年六月）铁路建设的成绩是非常可观的：在总局下面，已有哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔和牡丹江的三个分局，正式通车的铁路线长达六千六百一十一公里，占东北铁路线全长（蒋管区在内）百分之六十九·六，新收复的铁路线，占其中百分之十五·六；车头：如以一九四六年六月为一○○，现在（一九四七年六月）为八○六；车皮：如以一九四五年七月为一○○，现在（一九四七年六月）为二六九（按以上两项均为指数）；车次：一九四七年一月为一百一十二次，六月为三百四十二次，七月底则为三百八十七次；过去每小时车速三十公里，六月份每小时增加到五十公里，误点现象也已大大减少。对于铁路的管理，开始曾有两种不同的看法：一种是认为铁路管理是技术性的，要用一套旧的管理方法；另一种是技术服务于政治，强调群众路线与行政管理相结合，结果实行了第二个方针，工人当了家。依靠工人，清除了坏人，对于旧职员，则指出他们的前途：只有眼睛向下，转变思想作风，建立新的人生观，才能真正为人民服务。在这种建设方针之下，广大工人的力量发挥了起来，铁路完全换了一个新的面貌，工人自动做工有时每日达十六小时，过去换枕木，每天每人八根，现在每人已达三十八根，工人自动献出的材料，各站都值一两万万元。铁路工人的觉悟普遍提高，工会会员已达四万人，工人武装自卫队已达一千六百人，他们保证了前线的运输任务，保证了广大城乡之间交通的敏捷，同时，也保证了铁路管理的秩序，他们在一年间，已经清洗了两千名混入人民铁路事业中进行破坏活动的特务和坏分子。知道了有着这样一个新型的建设管理方针，和拥有一支如此强大的有觉悟的工人兄弟队伍以后，我们这群从关内解放区来的旅客，对于东北解放区铁路事业的所以能够迅速恢复和日臻完备，已经找到了一个确切的答案。
    我坐在自己的位子上，倚着光亮的大玻璃窗，望着从车旁涌流而过的东满地区无际的山林和沃野，突然的，我似乎第一次的感到了我们的解放区，是如此的广大和丰饶。当然，我从前便知道这个，可是总是从地图上抽象了解着这一事实，总没有象现在这样的亲切；现在——一九四七年夏天的某日，我正掠过物资丰饶风景幽美的东满，无数的村镇和城市在我们车旁滑过，我们要坐一天一夜的火车，然而，前面的路还长得很！
