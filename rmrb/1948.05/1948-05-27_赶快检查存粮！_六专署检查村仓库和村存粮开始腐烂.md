　　Hurry and Check the Stored Grain!
　　The Sixth Special District Administrative Office Inspects Village Warehouses and Finds Stored Grain Rotting
　　[Wu'an News] After the recent spring rains, the Taihang Sixth Special District Administrative Office immediately sent personnel to inspect warehouse management. According to Comrade Wang Yuanting, the stored grain in the × village branch warehouse in Wu'an (responsible for eight village warehouses) has begun to rot in some places, and the rot is extremely severe in certain areas. A preliminary inspection of three villages revealed that in the warehouse of ×× village, there were thirty places showing signs of damage, with five houses being damp; × village × village's stored grain occupied forty-nine houses, with twenty-seven houses being damp. More than 70,000 jin of corn were stored in the winery courtyard of × village, and the ground was damp and more than an inch thick. The corn was soaked in water. The wheat stored in another house was also damp for less than an inch. The wheat in Song Huaizhen's house was damp and spoiled by half an inch, and white mold had grown on the wheat closest to the ground. More than 200,000 jin of wheat were stored in Li Laifu's house, and insects had grown on the surface. After the inspection, the grain was dried, and the damp houses were reorganized and relocated. The situation revealed by these few places is extremely serious, and such unnecessary losses should be noted by all localities!
　　In addition to notifying the counties under its jurisdiction of the results of this inspection, the Special District Administrative Office also put forward suggestions for the future: start turning and drying the grain in early May. Under the premise of not wasting civilian labor, the relocation of grain should be planned. The county should send personnel, along with the district financial and grain workers, branch warehouse cadres, and Comrade Wang Yuanting (sent by the Special District Administrative Office), to jointly organize this work and continue to carefully inspect the conditions of each warehouse.

　　赶快检查存粮！
  　六专署检查村仓库和村存粮开始腐烂
    【武安消息】太行六专署在最近春雨后，即派员检查仓库管理工作，据王元庭同志回来谈，武安×村分仓库（负责八个村仓库）的存粮，有的已开始腐烂，各别地方腐烂的极其严重。初步检查了三个村，发现有××村仓库存粮地方三十处，有五座房子湿潮；×村×庄存粮占房四十九座，湿潮的房子有二十七处，×村酒坊院内存放玉茭七万多斤，地湿潮有一寸多厚，玉茭已和水泡了的一样，另一座房子存的麦子也湿潮了不足寸深。宋怀珍家麦子潮坏了半寸多，靠地的已生白毛。李来福家存有二十多万斤麦子，浮层生下了虫等。检查出后就晒的晒，房子潮的该调的调另换去处。从这几个地方发现的情况来看是极其严重的，这种不应有的损失，各地应引起注意！
    专署除将此次检查结果通知所属各县外，并提出今后意见，五月初开始翻晒粮食，在不浪费民力下，能够调动的要有计划的调动，县里派人和区财粮工作员、分库干部与王元庭（专署去人）同志，共同组织这一工作，继续认真的检查各仓库的情况。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（六专署财政科）
