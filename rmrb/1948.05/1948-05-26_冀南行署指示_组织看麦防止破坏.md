Jinan Administrative Office Instructions
	Organize Wheat Watching to Prevent Sabotage
[Jinan News] The Jinan Administrative Office issued instructions to all special commissioner's offices and county and city governments to strengthen the wheat harvesting work, stating: "The Little Grain season has passed, and the wheat is about to ripen. To ensure food for the people and the military, governments at all levels must attach importance to the organization and leadership of this year's wheat harvest. Recent investigations have revealed that counter-revolutionary elements are again plotting activities, spreading rumors, and attempting to loot and set fires during the wheat harvest to sabotage it. Therefore, it is necessary to raise the vigilance of governments at all levels and the people of the entire region as soon as possible, and vigorously carry out the following tasks to smoothly complete the wheat harvest task and stop the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements: 1. Conduct widespread and in-depth propaganda among the masses regarding the border government's March 8th announcement of 'Whoever Sows, Reaps,' and earnestly implement the various clauses in the announcement during the wheat harvest work. At any time and any place, expose the rumors of counter-revolutionary elements, and dispel the concerns of the masses ideologically and in action, stabilizing and improving production morale. 2. This year's wheat-watching methods in each village should be organized by the masses whose wheat fields are close to each other, voluntarily combining to organize wheat-watching mutual aid. Village cadres and militia should play a backbone role, pre-determine liaison signals, and usually focus on decentralized care of their own wheat fields (those who plant more wheat watch more, those who plant less wheat watch less, and those who are willing to hire people to watch on their behalf are also allowed). If counter-revolutionary elements are found collectively looting or setting fire to wheat, a signal should be immediately sent, and they should quickly combine at the scene of the incident, arrest them, and hand them over to the government for legal action. When organizing wheat watching, resolutely prevent formalism, coercion, commandism, and bad styles such as arbitrarily assigning labor and grain. 3. The issue of impoverished masses such as the lonely, widowed, elderly, and weak gleaning wheat should still follow the old customs and habits of the past in various places. 4. Solve the difficulties of the masses lacking labor and animal power during the wheat harvest. According to the needs of the masses, call on them to organize temporary wheat harvesting mutual aid on a voluntary basis, negotiate mutual aid methods based on the principle of "benefit for both labor and capital" and "mutual assistance and mutual benefit," so that those who plant less wheat but contribute more labor can receive appropriate wages, and those who plant more wheat but have less labor can complete the wheat harvest in a timely manner. As for the adjustment of labor between villages, appropriate adjustments must be organized only with the unanimous request of the masses on both sides, and no form of coercion is absolutely allowed. 5. During the wheat harvest period, all localities must strictly implement the joint circular issued by the border government and the military region headquarters regarding restricting the use of civilian labor. No organ, unit, or individual may illegally demand labor. Those who violate this should be punished and publicized in the newspaper. District and village governments should strictly refuse any demands for labor that do not follow legal procedures. If there is any coercive or threatening behavior, it should be handed over to the government for processing. 6. This office calls on governments, organs, groups, schools, and troops at all levels to carry forward the glorious tradition of helping the masses with production in the past years, and to draw on manpower and animal power as much as possible during the wheat harvest period to help the masses near the驻地 with the wheat harvest, especially the families of revolutionary martyrs, disabled soldiers, and impoverished elderly, weak, and widowed. Do not take any remuneration from the masses in order to further strengthen ties with the masses. 7. To solve the difficulties of impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers lacking labor for the wheat harvest, provide appropriate labor preferences based on the specific circumstances of each household. The above tasks must be started immediately. Each special commissioner's office, county (city) government should, in accordance with the spirit of this instruction, combine it with the local situation, hold meetings of district and village cadres, make specific arrangements, and disseminate them quickly."

　　冀南行署指示
  　组织看麦防止破坏
    【冀南消息】冀南行署为加强麦收工作对各专署、县市政府发出指示说：小满已过，麦子将熟，为了保证民食军需，各级政府必须重视今年麦收工作的组织领导。近查各地反革命分子又在阴谋活动，制造谣言，企图在麦收中抢掠放火，破坏麦收。因此必须及早提起各级政府与全区人民的高度警惕，为顺利完成麦收任务、制止反革命分子破坏而大力进行以下几项工作。一、在群众中普遍深入宣传边府三月八日公布的谁种谁收布告，并在麦收工作中认真执行该布告中各项条款。要随时随地揭破反革命分子的造谣，从思想上行动上解除群众顾虑，稳定与提高生产情绪。二、今年各村看麦办法，应由麦田相近的群众自愿结合，组织看麦互助。村干民兵应起骨干作用，事先规定联络信号，平时以分散看护自己麦田为主（种麦多者多看，种麦少者少看，愿雇人代看者亦可）。发现反革命分子集体抢掠、放火烧麦时，应立即发出信号，迅速结合出事地点，加以逮捕，送交政府法办。在组织看麦时，切实防止形式主义，强迫命令与随便派差、派粮等恶劣作风。三、孤寡老弱等贫苦群众拾麦的问题，仍遵守各地过去旧有风俗习惯。四、解决群众麦收中劳力畜力缺乏的困难。根据群众的需要，号召他们在自愿条件下，组织临时性的麦收互助，本“劳资两利”、“互助互利”的原则，商定互助办法，使种麦较少、出力较多者能得到适当的工资，使种麦较多、劳力较少者能及时完成麦收。至于村与村间劳力的调剂问题，须在双方群众一致要求下，才能组织适当的调剂，绝对不准许有任何形式的强迫。五、在麦收期间，各地尤须严格执行边府和军区司令部关于限制动用民力的联合通令，任何机关、部队或个人，均不得非法要差。违者应予处分，并登报公布。不按合法手续乱要差者，区、村政府应一律严加拒绝。如有强迫威胁行为，送交政府处理。六、本署号召各级政府、机关、团体、学校、部队，发扬过去历年来帮助群众生产的光荣传统，在麦收期间尽可能抽动人力、畜力，帮助驻地附近群众麦收，特别是烈军工属与贫苦的老弱孤寡。不取群众任何报酬，以进一步密切与群众的联系。七、解决劳力缺乏的贫苦烈军工属麦收困难，根据每户具体情况给以适当的劳力优待。以上各项工作，必须马上着手进行。各专署、县（市）政府应根据这一指示精神，结合本地情况，召开区村干部会议，具体布置，迅速下达。
