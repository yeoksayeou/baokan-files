The approach is: [1] Resolutely protect industry and commerce; [2] Relieve unemployment and provide loans; [3] Establish a new democratic order.

[Taiyue News] Since we recovered Yuncheng for the second time in February this year, Yuncheng has been moving towards prosperity step by step in the past three months because it has correctly implemented the central urban policy and industrial and commercial policies. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yuncheng City had 460 stationary merchants. During the period of Japanese occupation, there were at most 410. After the Japanese surrender, during the period when Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's bandit troops occupied the area, the number of businesses that went bankrupt was only 240. Later, because the transportation to Henan was opened, the number increased to a maximum of 527, most of which were small businesses. Now that we have liberated Yuncheng for only three months, the number of stationary merchants has increased to 573, which is more than before. There are also 760 street vendors. Among the 573 stationary merchants, commerce has decreased somewhat compared to before, but handicrafts have greatly developed, reaching a total of 224, more than double the number during the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit occupation. Among the handicrafts, there are two iron factories (employing 30 people), twelve towel weaving factories, seventeen blacksmith shops, and five soap factories, all producing items for the daily use of the common people.

How did Yuncheng become prosperous and lively? The first reason is that we adopted a policy of protecting industry and commerce. Because we had problems with the implementation of policies during our first liberation, the merchants were very worried and did not dare to open their doors. Therefore, after entering the city for the second time, the municipal government repeatedly publicized the industrial and commercial policies of our party, and only a few businesses opened their doors after the Lantern Festival. At this time, the democratic government strictly prohibited counties from arbitrarily arresting "struggle targets," stabilized social order, and guaranteed freedom of industrial and commercial operations. At the same time, the municipal government organized the Commercial Association and issued loans to help small industrial and commercial enterprises that did not have the strength to operate, issuing a total of more than 31 million twice. For those businesses that had fled (14 households were forced to flee by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and some households only had their managers flee, while the employees remained), the municipal government and the Commercial Association discussed and decided on protection measures: (1) If the manager fled but the second owner remained, the second owner would continue to operate. (2) If someone was entrusted to manage the business during the flight, the entrusted person would be responsible for doing business, and the Commercial Association would be responsible for inspection and supervision. (3) If the entire family fled and no one was entrusted, the Commercial Association would affix a seal and be responsible for guarding the business. The democratic government's responsible handling of affairs stabilized people's hearts. By March, the number of stationary merchants had increased to 417, with an additional 635 street vendors. The second reason is to relieve unemployment. Because of the destruction caused by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and the war, when the democratic government entered the city, more than 400 railway workers and electric light company workers had nothing to do, more than 200 rickshaw pullers had no work to do, and some families of puppet and die-hard elements (there were 120 puppet and die-hard organizations before liberation) also had no way to live. The democratic government issued loans and organized these people to change careers, mainly developing handicrafts. With the help of the government, they used their skills to open blacksmith shops, weave towels, make tin furniture, and some went to work in the salt ponds. For the families of puppet and die-hard elements, the main focus was on organizing them to spin and weave. Currently, except for a small number who are unwilling to work, all 600 unemployed people (some of whom have returned home to divide the land) have work to do. With everyone having a job, industry and commerce have become lively. The third reason is the establishment of a new social order. Starting on March 7th, a census was conducted. The census was combined with the promotion of policies. The government also issued a proclamation promoting the protection of human rights and strictly prohibiting indiscriminate killing and beatings. In this way, the masses were more at ease doing business. Starting on March 19th, a second large-scale clean-up and sanitation campaign was organized. The streets had not been cleaned for more than a year during the occupation by the bandit troops, and there was livestock manure, garbage piles, and unburied corpses everywhere, with a foul odor. The municipal government organized more than 100 large carts, used 70 laborers, and pulled out a total of 8,000 carts of manure and dirt, and more than 5,300 loads, and buried 421 dead people. From this time on, the people of Yuncheng breathed fresh air again.

In order to further develop industry and commerce, the municipal government has formulated new plans: to rely on the salt pond trade, support commerce, develop handicrafts, and slowly reorganize those businesses that cannot develop (such as selling silks and satins, cosmetics, etc.) to change industries so that everyone can develop and make money.

### 坚决执行中央城市政策　运城工商业走向繁荣

　　坚决执行中央城市政策
  　运城工商业走向繁荣
    作法是：〔一〕坚决保护工商业；〔二〕救济失业发放贷款；〔三〕建立新的民主秩序。
    【太岳消息】自今年二月咱们二次收复运城后，三个月来，因为正确的执行了中央的城市政策和工商业政策，运城已一步一步的走向繁荣。运城市抗战以前有坐商四百六十家，日寇占领时期顶多时是四百一十家。日本投降以后，蒋阎匪军侵占的时期，倒闭得只剩二百四十家。后来因为打通了和河南的交通，顶多时增加到五百二十七家，那时都是小买卖多。现在咱们解放运城不过三个月，坐商增加到五百七十三家，比以前那个时候都多。还有摊贩七百六十家。在五百七十三家坐商中，商业比以前减少了一些，手工业大大发展，共达二百二十四家，比蒋阎匪侵占时期多了一倍。手工业中，有两家铁工厂（用工三十名），十二家织毛巾厂，十七家铁匠炉，五家肥皂厂，都是生产老百姓日常用的东西。
    运城是怎样繁荣热闹起来的呢？第一个原因，是咱们采取了保护工商业的政策。因为咱们第一次解放时，执行政策上曾经有过毛病，商人们心病重，不敢开门；所以第二次进城后，市政府就反复宣传我党工商业政策，元宵节后才有少数商号开门。这时民主政府严格禁止各县乱抓“斗争对象”，安定社会秩序，保障工商营业自由。同时市政府一面组织商联会，一面发放贷款，帮助没力量经营的小工商业，两次共发放了三千一百多万。对那些逃跑了的商号（有十四户受蒋匪强制，全家逃跑；另有些户只经理逃了，店员还在），市政府和商联会商议决定了保护的办法：（一）经理跑了、二东家还在的，由二东家继续营业。（二）跑时委托过人的，由受委托人负责作生意，商联会负责检查监督。（三）全家逃走，又没托人的，由商联会贴上封条，负责看管。民主政府这样负责的办事，安定了人心。到三月份，坐商已发展到四百一十七家，另外有摊贩六百三十五家。第二个原因，是救济失业。因为蒋匪糟踏和战争破坏，民主政府进城时，有四百多铁路工人和电灯公司工人没事干，有二百多洋车夫也没活做，还有些伪顽家属（解放前有一百二十个伪顽机关）也没法生活。民主政府就发放贷款，组织这些人转业。主要是向手工业方面发展。他们在政府帮助下，运用各人的本事，开铁匠炉，织毛巾，打洋铁家具，有的下盐池作工。对伪顽家属，主要是组织他们纺织。眼前除了一部分不愿劳动的，六百失业的人（有一些人回家分地去了）都有了活做。大家都有了职业，工商业跟着就热闹了。第三个原因是建立新的社会秩序。三月七日开始，清查了一次户口。清查时和宣传政策结合在一起作。政府还出了布告，宣传保障人权，严格禁止乱杀人，乱打人。这样，群众更加安心做买卖。从三月十九日开始，又组织了二次大清洁卫生运动。在匪军占领时有一年多没打扫过街道，到处都是牲口粪，垃圾堆，死了的人没人收拾，臭气薰人。市政府组织了一百多辆大车，用了七十多工，共拉出粪土脏东西八千车，又五千三百多担，前后掩埋了四百二十一个死人。从这时起，运城人民又呼吸到新鲜空气了。
    为了进一步发展工商业，市政府又订出了新的计划：就是要依靠盐池的买卖，扶助商业，发展手工业，并慢慢组织那些不能发展的商号（如卖绸缎、化妆品等）改业，使大家都能发展，都能赚钱。
