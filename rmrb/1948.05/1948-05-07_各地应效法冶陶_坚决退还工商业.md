　　All Regions Should Emulate Yetao
　　Resolutely Returning Industry and Commerce
　　Today, this newspaper publishes the news of Yetao Town returning all wrongly struggled industry and commerce, providing a model for all regions in the district. We urge everyone to firmly and without hesitation act in accordance with the Central Bureau's industry and commerce policy, resolutely protect industry and commerce, and immediately and unconditionally return or compensate all wrongly struggled industry and commerce. Absolutely do not adopt a delaying, wait-and-see, or passively resistant attitude. It must be understood that the Party's policy is genuine, and the correction of errors is also genuine. The practice of Yetao will be universally implemented in all regions of the district. Some city Party committees and governments still dare not express their attitude to the masses, and dare not resolutely return the industry and commerce that was confiscated and then operated by the county and district to their original owners, causing the masses to doubt the policy. The result will inevitably lead to errors in resisting the policy, which should arouse everyone's deep vigilance. Yetao's return of industry and commerce, Yuanshi's return of Chunhetang Pharmacy, and Chengci's return of the pigment shop are all well done! Done right! It is hoped that all regions in the district will emulate them, firmly establish methods, and earnestly implement the policy of protecting industry and commerce step by step.

　　各地应效法冶陶
  　坚决退还工商业
    本报今日发表冶陶镇退还全部错斗工商业的消息向全区各地提供了一个范例，请大家坚定地，毫不犹豫地按照中央局工商业政策办事，坚决保护工商业，立即无条件的退还，或补偿一切错斗的工商业。决不可采取拖延，观望，消极抵抗的态度。必须懂得党的政策是真实的，纠正错误也是真实的，冶陶的做法将会在全区各地普遍施行。有些城市的党和政府至今尚不敢向群众表明态度，不敢坚决的先把没收后县区公营的工商业退还原主，造成群众对政策的疑虑，其结果势必造成违抗政策错误，应引起大家深切警惕。冶陶退还工商业，元氏退还春和堂大药铺，成磁退还颜料庄，这都做的好！做的对！希望全区各地效法他们，坚定的订出办法，有步骤地将保护工商业政策认真贯彻下去。
