　　Jiang's Special Agents Sabotage Dongming Dangerous Project
　　Enemy Planes Bomb Repair Crews for Days

　　[Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 4th dispatch] On the 19th of last month, when our large transport ship passed the 7th dam of the Gaocun Dangerous Project in Dongming, it encountered eight or nine enemy plainclothes agents who were using iron rakes to destroy the willow piles on the 4th dam and throw them into the river. At the same time, all the hemp ropes and wire ropes on the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th dams were completely destroyed for the fourth time. After the 7th dam was damaged, it continued to subside, and the water on the dam had overflowed by 3 centimeters, which was very dangerous. Meanwhile, the hemp ropes of all dams and revetments of the Nanhua, Zhukou, and Liuzhuang Dangerous Projects were cut off. At the Jiangsu Dam Great Dangerous Project, our repair workers were attacked as many as four times by Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Division and the bandit troops led by Du Lunling, the captain of the puppet Juancheng Brigade, in half a month from April 1st to 15th. Our river workers have been forced to stop work. The Xin'er Dam continues to subside, and the situation is precarious. From the atrocities of Chiang's bandits, their conspiracy to deliberately flood the people on our south bank has become increasingly exposed.

　　[Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 5th dispatch] Chiang's planes have been bombing and destroying the dike restoration project for days. At 2:00 PM on April 21st, the Puyang County Dike Repair Headquarters was holding a meeting of foreman-level cadres. Engineering personnel were allocating work on the Liqiao Dike when suddenly two American-made Chiang planes flew in from the southwest, indiscriminately bombing and strafing the dike repair personnel. One bomb hit Liqiao Street, killing villager Liu Fengjie and wounding a refugee from northern Juancheng. One bomb fell north of the street, destroying a house and breaking several trees. On the morning of the 23rd, all 4,630 workers in the county started to repair the dike. Chiang's planes disrupted the work three times throughout the day. In the last attack, enemy planes dropped three bombs on the Maogang Dike. One exploded in the air, and two landed in front of Maogang Village. Fortunately, our dike repair workers had made air raid preparations and suffered no losses. The enemy's vicious atrocities have aroused the anger of all dike repair workers.

　　[Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 5th dispatch] The dike restoration project on the northern bank of the Yellow River, the front line closest to the river, has already started. The south line of the Changyuan Great Dike, from Dacheji to Dayunzhuang, is estimated to require 280,000 cubic meters of earth to be added. 14,000 workers are being mobilized from Qingxian, Changyuan, Weinan, and Quhe counties to increase its height and thickness, and siltation projects are being carried out in the Shitouzhuang and Menggang dike sections. Construction started successively on April 23rd. The special district, county, office, and section have transferred a large number of cadres to organize command posts at all levels to lead the implementation of this project, and they have rushed to the work sites. A unit of the 4th Military Sub-district's armed forces has arrived in the border area of Quhe (a newly established county southwest of Changyuan) to ensure the safety of the workers and prepare to strike against Chiang's bandits' harassment. Despite the spring famine, the workers in our counties are still brewing to participate in the dike restoration for self-salvation, and their morale is very high.

　　蒋特破坏东明险工
  　敌机连日滥炸我修堤人员
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】上月十九日我运输大船通过东明高村险工第七坝，遇见敌便衣特务八九人，正在用铁耙子破坏四坝上柳桩投掷河内，同时第四、五、六、七各坝所有麻绳铁丝绳，又第四次全都破坏。七坝遭到破坏后，又继续下蛰，坝上已漫水三公寸，非常危险。同时，南华、朱口、刘庄险工各坝及护沿所有麻绳，均被割去。江苏坝大险工我抢修员工，自四月一日至十五日半个月内，被蒋机六十八师及伪鄄城大队中队长杜仑岭等匪军袭击达四次之多，我沿河员工已被迫停工。新二坝继续掉蛰，险象环生。从蒋匪这种暴行来看，其蓄意淹没我南岸人民的阴谋，已日益暴露。
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】蒋机连日轰炸破坏复堤工程。四月二十一日午后二时，濮县修堤指挥部正召开硪工组长以上干部会议，工程人员正在李桥堤上分工，忽从西南方飞来美式蒋机两架，向修堤人员肆行投弹和扫射，一弹中李桥街内，炸死村民刘凤阶一人，伤鄄北难民一人；一弹落街北，炸毁房子一座，折树数株。二十三日早上，全县四千六百三十名工人动工修堤，蒋机在一天中沿堤扰乱三次，最后一次敌机在毛岗堤上，向民工投弹三枚，一个空中爆炸，两个落在毛岗村前，幸我修堤民工早作防空准备，未受损失。敌人这种恶毒暴行，激起了全体修堤员工的愤怒。
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】黄河北岸临黄最前线复堤工程，业已动工。长垣南线大堤，自大车集至大蕴庄，占计需增土二八○○○○公方，分由清县、长垣、卫南、曲河四县动员民工一万四千人，进行加高培厚，并在石头庄、孟岗一带堤段作判淤工程。于四月二十三日先后开工，专、县、处、段为了领导这一工程的实施，抽调大批干部组织各级指挥部，先后奔赴工段。四分区武装一部为了保障民工的安全，已开抵曲河（长垣西南新设县）边缘地区，准备打击蒋匪的袭扰。我各县民工在春荒中，仍然酝酿参加复堤自救，情绪甚为高涨。
