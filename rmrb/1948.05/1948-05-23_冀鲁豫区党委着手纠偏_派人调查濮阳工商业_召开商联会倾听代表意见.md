[Ji-Lu-Yu News] According to the investigation by the District Party Committee's investigation and research team in Puyang City, 77 large and small industrial and commercial enterprises in Puyang City were liquidated and struggled against during the land reform review last year. The industries that were struggled against included 23 categories, including pickle gardens, grocery stores, pharmacies, general merchandise stores, dry tobacco shops, bathhouses, iron foundries, paper stores, distilleries, restaurants, silk stores, oil shops, foreign cloth shops, leather shops, Luo Di shops, paint shops, and dried fruit shops. Among them, 27 were partially confiscated, 23 were completely confiscated, and 27 were swept out of their homes.

Wine merchant Guo Baoquan was considered to have become rich by running a liquor store. All his belongings were confiscated, including 20 shi of grain, 3,000 jin of firewood, 650,000 yuan in cash, and all his furniture, totaling 2.56 million yuan. He was swept out of his home, and his son was forced to become a "glider" (likely referring to some form of public ridicule or punishment). Later, the whole family went out to beg for food. Now, he and his son sell sesame cakes on the street, barely able to support the two of them, while the women in the family continue to beg. During the liquidation, the general public generally felt that he should not have been swept out of his home and that he should have been left with something, but the cadres did not pay attention to this opinion of the masses.

Zhang Wenyu had more than 30 mu of land and a family of five, and also ran a private liquor store. Because we infringed on the interests of industry, commerce, and middle peasants, he was very frightened. One day, he was hiding his quilts and clothes when a street cadre came by and said that he was hiding landlord's things, and all his quilts, clothes, and liquor store items were confiscated; later, his house was also confiscated, and he was swept out of his home.

Yang Liuchun relied on making noodles for a living and was also struggled against for 150,000 yuan. The same business, the iron foundry, had five shares of capital confiscated. After the confiscation, it became so-called "masses'" shares and continued to operate jointly with some private shares, changing the Tongshang Furnace to the Qunxing Furnace. Wang Zizheng and two others became managers of the Qunxing Furnace and were not responsible for business operations at all. Especially Wang Zizheng, after taking office, either watched operas or played cards. When he returned to the store, he demanded whatever food he wanted to be made for him. Private shareholders and technicians were very dissatisfied but dared not criticize him.

Liu Meizhai, a representative of the Puyang City Federation of Industry and Commerce, raised the following criticisms and suggestions at the administrative office's symposium on industry and commerce: First, most of the merchants selling steamed buns are poor people who rely entirely on labor to support their families, but the business tax is calculated on a progressive basis based on the number of dou of wheat sold each day, which they all feel is too heavy. Second, too many miscellaneous goods are prohibited; for those that are not prohibited, the tax is also too heavy. Can the tax be reduced in the future, or can the prohibited items be relaxed somewhat to facilitate the free development of commerce? Third, the bathhouse employees are all poor people, and the daily business profits are divided on the same day and taken home to support their families, but they also pay business tax. They have a lot of complaints. Can the government reduce their business tax in the future? Fourth, commercial and civil organizations should be separated from farmers' organizations. Merchants and civilians should be led by the chamber of commerce because it is very inconvenient to mix merchants and farmers into one organization. Furthermore, the street administration's expenses and complicated errands affect the development of industry and commerce. Fifth, state-owned stores now control the market retail and wholesale prices, do not support small vendors, do not require small notes for wholesale, and raise prices at any time, completely for the purpose of making money, without regulating prices, stabilizing the market, or taking care of private merchants.

In short, from the above struggles against industry and commerce and unreasonable treatment of merchants, the leadership has committed serious left-leaning errors, causing many private businesses to collapse and the market to become depressed. In addition to some issues that need to be examined and corrected by higher-level leaders, the leading comrades in Puyang City should immediately, according to the Central Bureau's instructions on industrial and commercial policies, conduct a serious and profound examination ideologically, resolutely implement and carry out the Central Bureau's instructions on industrial and commercial policies, and restore and develop industry and commerce.

　　冀鲁豫区党委着手纠偏
  　派人调查濮阳工商业
    召开商联会倾听代表意见
    【冀鲁豫消息】根据区党委调查研究组在濮阳市的调查，濮市去年土改复查期间清算斗争了大小工商业七十七家，被斗争的各行业共有二十三种，包括酱菜园、杂货铺、药铺、广货铺、旱烟店、澡塘、铸铁炉、纸店、酒锅、饭铺、丝店、油铺、洋布庄、皮货铺、罗底铺、颜料庄、干果行等。其中没收一部的二十七家，没收全部的二十三家，扫地出门的二十七家。酒商郭保全被认为干酒铺发财，将东西全部没收，粮食二十石，柴三千斤，现款六十五万元，以及所有家具，共折合二百五十六万元。将他扫地出门，并把他儿子拉了滑子，以后全家出外讨饭。现在他和他儿子在街上发烧饼卖，只能维持他俩的生活，家里妇女仍然讨饭。在清算时，一般群众都认为不该扫地出门，要给他留点东西；但干部对群众这种意见未加注意。张文玉三十多亩地，五口人，另外经营着一个明酒铺。因为我们侵犯了工商业及中农利益，他十分恐慌。一天，他正在掩藏自己的被子、衣服，恰遇街干部去了，就说他是藏地主的东西哩，把他的被子、衣服和酒铺的东西全部没收了；后来又没收了房子，将他扫地出门。杨柳春指望着压面条为生，也被斗争十五万元。同商号铸铁炉，有五股资本被没收。没收后，变成了所谓“群众”的股份，与一部分私人股份继续合开，改同商炉为群兴炉。王子正等二人到群兴炉当上经理，对营业毫不负责。尤其王子正，任职后不是看戏，就是打牌。回到号里，要吃啥饭就得给他做啥饭。私人股东和技师非常不满，但不敢批评。濮阳市的商联会代表刘美斋在行署工商业座谈会上，曾经提出如下的几点批评与建议：第一、卖馍馍的商人多半是贫苦群众，完全依靠劳动生产养活全家，但纳营业税是按每天卖几斗麦子累进计算，一致感觉太重。第二、碎货被禁止的太多；不禁止的，纳税也太重。今后是否能减轻税收，或将违禁品放宽一些，以利商业自由发展。第三、澡塘店员完全是贫苦群众，每天营业所得红利，都是当天分开，拿回家去养家顾口，但也同样纳营业税。他们很有意见。今后政府能否减轻他们的营业税？第四、商民组织应当与农民组织分开。商民应当受商会领导。因商人农民混合一个组织有很多不方便。再者，街政花费与差务繁杂，影响工商业发展。第五、公营商店现在统制着市场零售和批发价目，不支持小商贩，批发时不要小票，货价随时提高，完全以赚钱为目的，不调剂物价，稳定市场，也不照顾私商。总之，从以上斗争工商业和对商人不合理的待遇上看，领导上都犯了严重的左倾错误，使很多私营商业垮台，市场走向萧条。除有些问题需要上级领导者检查纠正外，濮阳城区领导同志应当立即根据中央局对工商业政策的指示，从思想上做一严肃的深刻的检查，坚决执行与贯彻中央局对工商业政策的指示，把工商业恢复与发展起来。
