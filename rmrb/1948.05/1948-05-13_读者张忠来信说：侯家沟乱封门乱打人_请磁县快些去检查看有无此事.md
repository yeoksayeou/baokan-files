[Our Newspaper News] According to Comrade Zhang Zhong from the Fourth District of Cixian County, he recently heard reports that some villages in Cixian County have experienced the following problems during the land redistribution work: (1) Houjiagou village is making a mess of the land redistribution work. Without even classifying social status, they sealed the doors of more than 40 households. The entire village has fewer than 300 households. Over the issue of movable property, men are being beaten, women are being dragged, some are beaten to the point of death and then revived, some are being forced to seek death, and some are being swept out the door...and are not allowed to beg for food. It is also said that whoever publicizes the situation in the village is sabotaging the Land Law. (2) Zhangjiazhuang sealed the doors of several households without conducting class classification, in the second month of the lunar calendar. Those under control are forced to eat, and not allowed to beg for food, but if they don't beg for food, they have nothing to eat. In addition, those households whose doors are not sealed are not allowed to resolve their difficulties. (3) In Weiwuzhuang, class classifications are being raised, and many people in the village cannot reconcile with this ideologically. (4) In Xiangshuiliang village, some people who are not landlords, not even rich peasants, are being confiscated and punished.

The people who were talking said that the land redistribution work as published in the newspapers is different from how these villages are doing it, and they don't know what's going on. The leadership has already given specific instructions to correct the excesses in some places, but they don't know what to do in places where there are no instructions. They also said that recently, after understanding the policy, the number of households who fled and want to return must be quite a few, but if they hear that the facts are different from the policy, they are afraid of hesitating and not daring to return. In the villages carrying out land redistribution, the households with problems are afraid of not producing, and the households without problems are also afraid of not producing. They say: other people (middle peasants) still have problems, can we guarantee we will be okay, so they waste food and drink extravagantly. In the villages that have not carried out land redistribution, seeing what other villages are doing, they all say: when it comes to our village, it will be hard to say what to do, we'll plant the land for one season at a time, and we'll deal with it when the time comes, eating and drinking a little is the right thing to do. Comrade Zhang Zhong said: What I have heard in bits and pieces is even more left than the specific situations I have written about in those few villages, but because I have not conducted an investigation, I dare not write about it boldly. However, I feel that this is not a small problem.

    读者张忠来信说：侯家沟乱封门乱打人
    请磁县快些去检查看有无此事
    【本报消息】据磁县四区张忠同志来信说，最近他听到有人反映磁县有些村在填补工作中发生以下问题：（一）侯家沟村闹填补工作，未划阶级就封了四十多户门，全村不到三百户；因浮财问题，有男的挨打的，女的挨拖的，有打死返活，有被迫寻死的，有扫地出门的……，并不让讨饭，并说谁宣传村里情况，谁是破坏土地法。（二）张家庄未进行划阶级就封了好几家门，是阴二月初间封的。管制吃，不叫讨饭，不讨饭又没啥吃。另外对没封门的户，有困难不让解决。（三）韦武庄划阶级提高成份，村里有好些人思想打不通。（四）响水亮村有不是地主连富农也不到的，有没收体罚的。
    谈话的人说，报上登的填补工作，和这些村的干法不一样，也不知怎么回事？领导上对有些地方左了的，已有具体指示纠正，但不知没有指示的地方该怎样？又说逃亡户近来明了我政策后，想回来的人定不能少，但如听说事实给政策不同，恐有观望不敢回来。进行填补的村庄，有问题的户害怕不生产，没问题的户，也害怕不生产，他们说：人家（中农）还有事，咱能保证没事，于是浪费大吃二喝。没进行填补工作的村庄，见别的村庄那个做法，都说：将来到咱村说不清怎样做哩，地种一季说一季吧，到啥时说啥时吧，吃喝点是对的。张忠同志说：零碎听到的，比写出那几村情形具体更左，因没进行过调查，不敢大胆去写。不过觉得这并不是个小问题。
