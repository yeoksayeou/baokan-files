(Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 29th) After the "Three Checks" campaign in the Jin-Sui military industrial sector, the class consciousness of workers in various factories has generally improved. They enthusiastically responded to the call of the Ministry of Industry to step up production and support the front lines, resulting in increased production efficiency. A certain factory launched a production competition, proposing conditions such as exceeding the original production plan by 25 percent, unity and mutual assistance, actively helping apprentices, and not resting for minor illnesses. With the active efforts of all employees, the daily output of the entire factory has exceeded the original plan by 50 percent. Worker Hao Shouwei improved his technique, increasing output by 200 percent in a few days. Another factory increased its task by one-fifth, but due to the workers starting work earlier, finishing later, and helping each other, the output also increased by 50 percent, and the quality was also good. Chen Jingnian, a worker in the fitter group, improved his tools, increasing output by 40 percent and completing a month's plan in two days. Many workers in the factory completed a month's task in half a month to twenty days.

　　晋绥军工部经过三查
    各厂产量激增
    【新华社晋绥二十九日电】晋绥军工部门各工厂职工经过三查后，阶级觉悟普遍提高。热烈响应工业部加紧生产，支援前线的号召，生产效率增高。某厂发起生产大竞赛，提出生产量超过原计划百分之二十五，团结互助，积极帮助学徒，小病不休息等条件。在全体职工积极努力下，全厂每天产量已超过原计划百分之五十。工人郝守维改进技术，几天内产量增加百分之二百。另厂增加任务五分之一，但由于职工早上工，迟下工，互相帮助，使产量亦增加百分之五十，质量亦好。钳工组工人陈敬年改进工具，使产量提高百分之四十，两天完成一个月的计划。该厂许多工人均于半月至二十天完成一个月的任务。
