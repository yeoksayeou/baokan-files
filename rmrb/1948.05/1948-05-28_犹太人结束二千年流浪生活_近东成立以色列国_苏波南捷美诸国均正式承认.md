Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th -- Comprehensive Report: The Jews in Palestine, in accordance with the UN General Assembly partition resolution of November 29th last year, formally established the first Jewish state in two thousand years on the 14th of this month, after Britain ended its mandate. It is named the "State of Israel" with its capital in Tel Aviv (located on the central western coast of Palestine, on the Mediterranean Sea). At the same time, a provisional government of the new State of Israel was formed, with David Ben-Gurion, former chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency, as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, and Moshe Sharett as Foreign Minister. The Jewish National Council also elected Chaim Weizmann, former chairman of the Jewish Agency’s General Assembly, as the first President of the State of Israel. The establishment of the State of Israel has thwarted the conspiracy of American and British imperialism, which for more than two months sought to dominate Palestine through the so-called "United Nations Trusteeship." The Truman administration, which went back on its word and overturned its own initially proposed partition plan, instead demanding a trusteeship, hastily abandoned its proposed "trusteeship plan" after the State of Israel was established. Truman, who on the 13th had instructed Marshall to "advise" the Jews not to establish an independent state, issued a statement recognizing it within minutes of the establishment of the State of Israel the next day. His purpose was, on the one hand, to avoid losing the votes of American Jews in this year's election, and on the other hand, to curry favor with the new State of Israel, hoping to influence its government. Truman's swift "change" caught even the American representatives who were grandstanding at the UN General Assembly in favor of a trusteeship for Palestine by surprise. When the news reached the venue, they initially refused to acknowledge it, and then appeared utterly embarrassed. The General Assembly rejected the American trusteeship proposal and the British proposal to form a provisional neutral government for Palestine. The unprincipled and fragile nature of the unjust American foreign policy has been fully exposed. As for the Soviet Union, which has consistently upheld the independence of the Jewish nation (the Russian Soviet Republic has a Jewish Autonomous Oblast), after receiving Sharett's telegram on the 16th requesting recognition of the State of Israel, Molotov officially replied on the 17th with recognition. As of the 19th, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Guatemala have recognized the new Jewish state.

　　犹太人结束二千年流浪生活
  　近东成立以色列国
  　苏波南捷美诸国均正式承认
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合报导：巴勒斯坦犹太人已按照去年十一月二十九日的联大分治决定，在本月十四日英国结束委任统治后，正式成立二千年来第一个犹太国，定名为“以色列”国，定都于特拉维夫（位于巴勒斯坦中部西海岸，滨地中海）。同时，并组成新以色列国的临时政府，由前犹太事务局执行委员会主席本古里安任总理兼国防部长，席托克任外交部长。犹太民族委员会又推选前犹太事务局代表大会主席魏兹曼为以色列国首任大总统。以色列国的成立，已使两个多月来美、英帝国主义企图借所谓“联合国托管”以主宰巴勒斯坦的阴谋遭受挫败。出尔反尔地推翻了自己首先提出的分治计划，而要求改行托管的杜鲁门政府，在以色列国成立后，又忽促收起自己提出的“托管计划”。十三日还命马歇尔“劝告”犹太人勿成立独立国家的杜鲁门，在第二天以色列国成立后数分钟，即发表声明予以承认，其目的一方面在于希望在今年大选时不失去美国犹太人的选票；一方面讨好新以色列国，以为影响该国政府的资本。杜鲁门这一迅速的“转变”，竟连正在联大大放厥辞主张巴勒斯坦托管的美国代表，都来不及通知。当这一消息传到会场时，他们始则拒绝承认，继而表现狼狈不堪。大会否决了美国的托管方案与英国组织巴勒斯坦临时中立政府的建议。不义的美国外交政策的无原则性和脆弱性，则已经暴露无余。至于一贯维护犹太民族独立的苏联（苏联俄罗斯共和国有犹太自治省）在收到席托克十六日要求承认以色列国的电报后，已于十七日由莫洛托夫复电正式予以承认。截至十九日止，已有波兰、南斯拉夫、捷克斯拉夫与危地马拉等国承认新犹太国。
