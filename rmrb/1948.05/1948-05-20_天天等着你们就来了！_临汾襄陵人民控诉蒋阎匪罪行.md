　　"We've been waiting for you every day!"
　　Linfen Xiangling People Accuse Chiang and Yan of Bandit Crimes
　　[This dispatch from the Jinan Front, May 18th] The people in the Linfen and Xiangling area of Southern Shanxi are looking forward to the People's Liberation Army swiftly rescuing them from their misery. The people shed tears whenever they mention the disasters brought to them by the Chiang and Yan bandit troops. Under Yan's "soldier-peasant integration" tyranny, people's lives were constantly in danger, and they were often arbitrarily killed on charges of "rebellion." The conscription system under Yan's "soldier-peasant integration" changed from one soldier for every five people to one soldier for every three people. When Yan's bandit troops suffered successive defeats in Southern Shanxi and their forces were depleted, they simply resorted to "grabbing soldiers" and "snatching soldiers." In Dengzhuang village alone, more than 200 merchants were seized in two instances, forcing shops to close down. The age limit for conscription had also long been broken, exceeding the 18 to 40-year-old limit. Lu Gengeng, the orphaned son of Lu Jiqing in Sitou Village, was only twelve years old when he was "picked up" as a soldier. The Chiang and Yan bandit troops in Linfen openly requisition and blatantly plunder everything from the peasants, making it impossible for them to survive. In addition to frequently levying heavy grain burdens on the people, there were also various pretexts such as "substitute purchase," "credit purchase," "autumn levy," and "bandit suppression" to extract from the people, with methods too numerous to count. In addition, there were funds for shoes, socks, lamp oil, gun cleaning cloths, etc. When paying grain款, the people were subjected to layer upon layer of exploitation by Yan's officials. As a result, many people were forced to flee because they could not afford to pay the grain款, and many villages became desolate and uninhabited areas. Under these circumstances of popular impoverishment, the Chiang and Yan bandit troops simply used robbery instead of conscription. Every time they arrived in a village, they carried guns and ammunition and started openly robbing from several miles away. Sitou Village has been robbed four times in the two months from last December to now. On the twelfth day of the first lunar month, the pseudo-police team ransacked the village, rummaging through boxes and overturning the ground to search for grain, causing trouble for a whole day, and looting more than 30 large carts of grain, furniture, etc., even taking away a little bit of oil and salt. Now all the people in the village have no clothes or food and are living on wild vegetables. The people simply cannot survive under the looting of the Chiang and Yan bandit troops. But these bandits were not satisfied. At the beginning of last month, Deng, the pseudo-commissioner of Linfen, instructed Yang Shenggen, the commander of the pseudo-security regiment, saying: "This 'sudden conscription' of grain is crucial to our survival. The amount of grain sent into the city by various ×× districts is very small, and the responsible comrades are quite dissatisfied." This time, when our People's Liberation Army went to Linfen, the people complained about the crimes of the Chiang and Yan bandit troops. When the people of Sitou Village saw the People's Liberation Army coming, they excitedly said: "We've been waiting for you every day, you've finally come, we couldn't have survived a few more days."

　　“天天等着你们就来了！”
  　临汾襄陵人民控诉蒋阎匪罪行
    【本报晋南前线十八日电】晋南临汾、襄陵一带的老百姓，天天盼望着人民解放军迅速把他们从水深火热中挽救出来。老百姓一提到蒋阎匪军所带给他们的灾难时就掉下泪来了。老百姓在阎匪“兵农合一”的暴政下，生命朝不保夕，常被加上“造反”的罪名随便杀害。阎匪“兵农合一”下的兵役制度，由五人出一兵改成三人出一兵。当阎匪在晋南连吃败仗后，兵力空虚，就干脆实行“抓兵”、“抢兵”的方法。在邓庄一个村，两次就抓去商人二百多人，弄得商店不得不关门停业。在兵役年限上，也早已打破了十八岁至四十岁以内的规定。寺头村鹿吉清的孤子根根，才十二岁就被“拾兵”拾去了。在临汾的蒋阎匪军，对农民的一切剥夺，由公开的征收到明抢暗劫，使老百姓无法过活。除了经常向老百姓征收苛重的粮食负担外，还有“代购”，“赊购”，“秋征”，“戡乱”等种种名目向老百姓榨取，方法多到难以计算。此外，尚有鞋袜，灯油，擦枪布等款项，在缴纳粮款时，还要受到阎匪官府一级一级的层层剥削。因此许多老百姓因缴不起粮款而被迫逃亡，许多村庄变成了凄惨荒凉的无人区。在这种民穷财尽的情况下，蒋阎匪军就干脆用抢劫代征的方法，每到一村，荷枪实弹，从几里地以外就打起枪来进行公开的打劫。寺头村从去年腊月到现在，两个多月当中被抢四次。正月十二日，伪保警队到该村翻箱倒柜，掘地搜粮，整整闹了一天，抢走粮食家具等三十多大车，连一点点油盐也抢走了。现在全村老百姓无衣无食，吃野菜度日。在蒋阎匪军的抢劫下，老百姓实在无法活下去了。可是这些匪徒们还觉得不满足。上月初，临汾伪专员邓某给伪保安团团长杨升根的指示上说：“这次‘突征，粮食关系我们存亡甚大，各××区征送入城之粮甚少，各负责同志颇表不满。”此次我人民解放军开赴临汾，老百姓纷纷控诉蒋阎匪军罪行。寺头村老百姓，看见人民解放军来了，兴奋的说：“天天等着呢，你们就来了，再迟来几天活也活不了。”
