    Can a Widow Take All of Her Land With Her?
    To the Editor:
    There is a widow in Shuiyu Village, District One, Jixian County. She married Liu Yutang from the same village. The widow is of middle peasant status, owning nine and a half mu of land and has two young children. She has no other relatives. Leaving the two children at home means they cannot sustain their lives and cannot farm the land. The widow wishes to take both children and all the land to Liu Yutang's home. When the children grow up, they will bring the land back to their original home to live on. Liu Yutang agrees. However, the masses disagree, saying that Liu Yutang is also a middle peasant with twenty-one mu of land and a family of nine. According to the village's production point calculation, Liu Yutang has 36.6 points, and the widow has 19.2 points. If the village average is calculated based on production points, each person averages three points; if calculated based on land area, each person averages 2.3 mu. The masses fear that if the widow brings the land to Liu Yutang's home, it will be impossible to extract it during the land redistribution in the village in the future. They suggest that the widow should leave the surplus part now, according to the village average, and lend it to landless or land-poor people. However, the village cadres dare not make a decision and brought both the man and woman to the judicial section to ask how to handle this.
    We consider this issue. Leaving the land behind to be lent to landless or land-poor people seems appropriate; based on the principle of ownership, the widow should also be able to take it. What is the correct way to handle this? We have not reached a mature conclusion and request a reply.
    In addition, there was a fifteen-article instruction regarding widows' inheritance rights from the Border Region High Court in the thirty-first and thirty-second years of the Republic of China. Later, it was said that it was revised to thirteen articles at the Border Region Provisional Assembly, but there was no explicit order. We don't know if that instruction is still applicable to this widow now. Wu Shenzhi

Wu Shenzhi Comrade:
    A widow has the right to dispose of her property when she remarries, and others must not interfere arbitrarily. Regarding the matter mentioned in your letter, that the widow wants to take her children and land together, since both parties are willing and no one in her original husband's family has raised any objections, they should be allowed to handle it themselves. The masses' unwillingness and desire to leave the surplus land behind is incorrect because, first, without conducting land consolidation, land cannot be arbitrarily moved; second, when taking surplus land from wealthy middle peasants during land consolidation, their consent must be obtained. If they do not agree, concessions must be made, and it cannot be decided solely by the masses to take it as they please. In addition, regarding whether the previous instruction on widows' inheritance rights is still applicable, you can consult the Border Region High Court.

    寡妇的地是否可全带走？
    编辑同志：
    汲县一区水峪村一个寡妇，与本村刘玉堂结婚，该寡妇中农成份，有地九亩半，有小孩两个（还小），别无他人，留下两小孩在家不能维持生活，不能养种，寡妇愿将两小孩与地全部带到刘玉堂家，将来小孩大了，将地还带回本家过生活，刘玉堂也同意。但群众意见不愿意，说刘玉堂也是中农，家有地二十一亩，人九口，按村内产量分数，刘玉堂是卅六分六，寡妇产量分数是十九分二，全村平均数若按产量分数计算，每人平均三分；若按地亩数计算，每人平均二亩三分。群众怕寡妇把地带到刘玉堂家，将来在该村平分土地时抽不出来了，不如现在按全村平均数，叫寡妇把富裕部分留下，借给无地少地的人种。但村干部不敢作主处理，带男女双方到司法科来问该如何处理。
    我们考虑这问题，把地留下借给无地少地人种也合适；按主权说寡妇带走也应该，究竟该怎样处理？我们考虑不成熟，请答复。
    另外在民国三十一二年边区高等法院有个关于寡妇继承财产权的指示，共十五条，后听说在边区临参会上又修改为十三条，没有明令，不知该寡妇现在还能适用该指示不能。  吴慎之吴慎之同志：
    寡妇再嫁时有权处理自己的财产，别人不得随便干涉。就来信中所谈寡妇要将孩子与土地一块带走，既然双方自愿，其原来丈夫家中又没有人提出意见，就应由他们自己处理，群众不愿意，想把多余土地留下是不对的，因为第一不进行填补地区，不能随便抽动土地；第二，填补中要抽动富裕中农多余土地时，必须征得本人同意，不同意就须让步，而不能单由群众决定，想抽就抽。另外关于过去寡妇继承财产权的指示是否还适用，可请示边区高等法院。
