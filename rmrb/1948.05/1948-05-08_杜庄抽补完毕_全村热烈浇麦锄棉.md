　　Duzhuang Completes Land Redistribution
  　The Whole Village Enthusiastically Waters Wheat and Hoes Cotton

　　[Wu'an News] After the democratic rectification and replenishment movement in Duzhuang Village, Wu'an, landless and land-poor peasants and middle peasants all have land to cultivate. Party members have improved their ideological awareness after the rectification. The middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against have had their grievances addressed and received compensation. The entire village, men and women, old and young, are more actively engaged in production. The entire village, with a population of 866, has planted more than 982 mu of cotton. They are generally watering the wheat for the third time and starting to hoe the cotton. Women participate in agricultural production as much as men and also engage in textile work.

　　The middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against are very happy after receiving compensation. Zhao Wanchun, the son of a wealthy middle peasant, said: "The masses treat us as one of their own and ask us to attend meetings and join the (farmers') association. We also feel happy." Shen Deli, who was wrongly struggled against, said: "I had never cultivated first-class irrigated land before. This time, I was allocated (compensated with) 1.7 mu of good irrigated land, and the house was returned to me. This is even better than before. I used to be able to plow eight mu of land a day. As long as the animals are well-matched, I can still plow eight mu of land." When he goes to the fields, he carries a basket, collecting firewood on one side and manure on the other. Jia Fu said: "When people feel happy, they have energy to do anything. I water the garden in the field, and my wife spins cotton at home. We both participate in production."

　　After the rectification, all seventeen party members of the branch are actively engaged in production. For example, Comrade Zhang Tingyun and his wife go to the fields to divert water. Comrades Yang Fushan, Jia Xiaoting, and Zhang Tai, among others, have already watered their wheat four times. Comrade Zhang Tai said: "Don't think that because I am a businessman, I can't do anything. While they are still watering the wheat for the third time, I have already finished watering it for the fourth time. I can handle the workload of one person." Comrade Yang Wancai organizes his entire family to engage in production. The four women in his family all participate in watering the garden and diverting water. Recently, they spun eight jin of cotton and wove it into cloth. Because women participate in agricultural production, male laborers are freed up to work as porters, earning a gross profit of 30,000 yuan per trip. They also take the time to compost fertilizer.

　　Yang Shunchuan, who is sixty-five years old, hoes two mu of cotton in one day. His wife spins cotton, and his son hauls coal. He said that he used to have no land to cultivate (rented land) and worked for landlords all year round. Now he is working for himself, and no one is willing to slack off. Under the leadership of the newly appointed production committee member Ma Jiabao, the village cooperative recently adjusted 600 jin of cotton seeds for the masses and 410 jin of cotton for 68 textile women, and is actively preparing to open an oil mill while distributing dividends to the masses.

　　杜庄抽补完毕
  　全村热烈浇麦锄棉
    【武安消息】武安杜庄村，经过民主整党填补运动后，没地及少地的贫中农都有了地种，党员经过整党，思想觉悟提高，错斗了的中农去了心病得到补偿，全村男女老少生产更加积极，全村共有八六六口人，共种棉花九八二亩多，一般都是在浇三水麦子，开始锄棉。妇女同男人一样参加农业生产，并进行纺织。
    错斗了的中农得到补偿后，都很高兴，富裕中农赵万春儿子说：“群众把咱当成一家人，也叫咱开会入（农）会，咱也觉着痛快。”错斗的申得立说：“我过去没种过头等水地，这次给分了（补偿）好水地一亩七分，将房子都给退回，这比以前还强哩。我前几年一天能犁八亩地，只要合对牲口，还能犁地八亩。”他去地时挑着箩头，一头拾柴，一头拾粪。贾福说：“人心里痛快了，干啥也有劲，我在地浇园，老婆在家纺花，都参加了生产。”
    经过整党，支部共十七个党员，都积极起来搞生产。如张廷云同志跟老婆到地拐水，杨富山、贾小廷、张太等同志，麦子有的已经浇四水，张太同志说：不用看我是个商人出身，他们还在浇三水，我已经浇完了四水，也能顶住一个人受哩。杨万才同志组织全家生产，家中四个妇女都参加浇园拐水。最近纺花八斤，并织成了布。由于妇女参加农业生产，抽出男劳力去拉脚，一遭就看毛利三万元，自己还要抽空沤肥。
    六十五岁的杨顺川，一天就锄了二亩棉花，他老婆纺花，小子拉煤。他说过去没地种（租佃地），整年给人家（地主）受，现在给自己受哩，谁肯不干。本村合作社在新任生产委员马贾保领导后，最近给群众调剂了棉花籽六百斤，又给六十八个纺织妇女调剂了棉花四百一十斤，并正在与群众分红，积极筹备开油坊。
