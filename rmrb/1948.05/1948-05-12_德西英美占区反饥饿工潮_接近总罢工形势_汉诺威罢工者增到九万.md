Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th - Berlin dispatch: The anti-hunger strike wave in the Western three occupation zones of Germany continues to surge, "approaching a general strike situation" (Berlin News). The strike in Hanover, which has lasted for over a week, has increased to 90,000 workers. Transportation in the city is at a standstill, and newspapers cannot be published. Eighty percent of the metal workers in Nuremberg have declared a strike, and the strikes in Augsburg and Mannheim are continuing. The Berlin Metal Workers' Union has announced that it will act in solidarity with the workers in Hanover and has decided to provide them with financial assistance. Union officials expect the strike to reach 600,000 people. The Berlin News pointed out that the strikes in the Western occupation zones "are aimed at the erroneous food policy, but ultimately, they are aimed at the colonial system of the Marshall Plan."

    德西英美占区反饥饿工潮
    接近总罢工形势
    汉诺威罢工者增到九万
    【新华社陕北十日电】柏林讯：德国西部三占区反饥饿罢工浪潮继续高涨，“已接近于总罢工形势”（柏林新闻）。为时周余的汉诺威罢工工人已增至九万人。该市交通陷于停顿，报纸亦不能出版。努连堡金属工人百分之八十已宣告罢工，奥格斯堡和曼海姆工人罢工仍在继续中。柏林金属工人工会顷宣布与汉诺威工人一致行动，并决定以金钱援助他们。工会人士预料罢工将达六十万人。柏林新闻指出：西占区的罢工“是针对着错误的粮食政策，但归根结蒂是针对着马歇尔的殖民制度。”
