Jinan Front, May 12th (This Newspaper Dispatch) News from the Jinan Front: During the spring offensive, the People's Liberation Army on the Jinan Front is utilizing the lulls in fighting to conduct rectification and large-scale military training. When the 1314 Unit was rectifying, it concentrated cadres for "three checks" study, soldiers for speaking bitterness, and universally launched a democratic movement in the unit, advocating criticism and self-criticism. After rectification, the class consciousness and democratic work style of both cadres and soldiers were greatly improved, and a new atmosphere was shown in the unit. During marches, cadres and soldiers automatically helped civilian porters carry stretchers, and helped cooks carry marching pots and food burdens. When a soldier fell ill, Company Commander × carried him on his back for several miles. When camping at night, cadres checked on the squads several times and even covered the soldiers with quilts. Under the democratic system, the company's finances are completely open, with soldiers electing an economic committee to directly manage food, using the saved firewood and other expenses to improve meals. Company × adjusted the schedule to eat fried dough sticks and dumplings twice a week. When there were difficulties, everyone thought of solutions. Because one unit accidentally cracked six pots belonging to the masses, the soldiers automatically found someone in their own unit who knew how to mend pots to fix them. The masses said, "They mend better than the pot menders." This maintained a good relationship between the troops and the masses. After only a few days of Company × stationed in Village ×, the masses automatically performed Yangko dances and entertainment for the army. After rectification and education through various specific facts, liberated soldier Shi Zhenyuan said, "Before, I didn't know how good the Liberation Army was and even carried the burden of being a prisoner. After rectification, I realized that I was now in charge of my own affairs, and I am determined to stick it out to the end!"

　　While carrying out unit rectification and a large-scale military training movement, the Third Detachment initially concentrated cadres for "three checks" rectification while starting a military training movement in the unit. In the first stage of the movement, significant achievements were demonstrated. For example, in grenade throwing, general companies averaged over 30 meters, and some reached an average of 40 meters with accuracy. The progress of field work was more than doubled compared to the past. Especially in blasting techniques, now the soldiers of each company have generally learned how to use explosives, and more than one-third of the soldiers are proficient in blasting techniques. One regiment had only three people who did not know how to blast. Without engineers, they can also blast hidden bunkers, outer moats, and city walls, to clear the way for assault troops, and can carry out continuous blasting in small groups to seize enemy positions. After the first stage of military training and concentrated "three checks" rectification of cadres, and with the universal implementation of democracy in the unit, the relationship between officers and soldiers in the unit was further improved, and the morale of the soldiers was even higher. Then, they entered the collective study of fortress assault operations. In the process of learning, they also combined the experience summary of the Yuncheng Campaign to improve the tactical thinking and combat actions of commanders and fighters. The entire detachment held a joint exercise of infantry, artillery, and engineering, firing live ammunition at two groups of bunkers and a solid city wall. After the exercise began, mountain guns destroyed two bunkers with four shells fired from a range of 300 meters from the enemy. Heavy machine guns began to strictly block the gun holes of the high bunkers, and the infantry braved the fire network to continuously blast. In just 20 minutes, the two groups of fortifications were completely destroyed. At this time, under the cover of our powerful firepower, the blasting teams continued to blast. In an instant, the two-zhang-wide and deep outer moat was cleared into a flat slope, and a solid city wall cracked an eight-meter-wide gap in the smoke and dust. Assault team members rushed in, and before the dust had settled, a battalion of troops had broken into the city and controlled the gap, completely occupying the attacked city. After this exercise, all commanders and fighters personally experienced a great improvement in their fortress assault skills. Their morale was unprecedentedly high, and they were ready to show their skills in capturing all the enemy's remaining strongholds in our inland areas.

　　晋南我军春季攻势空隙中
  　开展大练兵运动
    【本报晋南前线十二日电】晋南前线消息：晋南前线人民解放军在春季攻势中，利用战隙进行整训及大规模的练兵运动。一三一四部队在整训时，集中干部进行三查学习，战士进行诉苦，并在部队中普遍展开民主运动，提倡批评与自我批评。经整训后，干部与战士的阶级觉悟与民主作风都大为提高，并在部队中表现了新的气象。在行军中，干部和战士自动帮助民夫抬担架，帮助伙夫背行军锅、挑伙食担子。一个战士病了，×连长背上走了好几里地。晚上宿营时，干部到班上看好几次，还给战士盖被子。在民主制度下，连队经济完全公开，由战士选出经济委员会，直接管理伙食，用节省下来的柴火等费用改善伙食。×连调剂每周吃两顿油条，两顿饺子。有了困难大家想办法。有一个单位因不小心弄裂了群众的六口锅，战士自动想办法，找自己单位会补锅的人补好了，群众说：“比补锅的还补的好。”使部队与群众保持了良好的关系。×连驻×村才几天，群众即自动为军队扭秧歌、闹娱乐。经过整训及各种具体事实的教育，解放战士石振元说：“先前我不知道解放军是怎样好，还背了个俘虏包袱，整训后，知道是自己当家了，今后一定决心干到底！”
    在进行部队整训及大规模的练兵运动中，三支队开始时一面集中干部进行三查整训，一面在部队中开始进行练兵运动。在头一阶段的运动中即表现了显著的成绩。如投弹，一般的连队均在三十公尺以上，有的则达到平均四十公尺而且投得准确。土工作业的进度比过去提高一倍以上。特别在爆破技术上，现各连队战士普遍学会使用炸药，有三分之一以上的战士熟练爆破技术，有一个团只有三个人不会爆破。没有工兵他们也可以爆破暗碉堡、外壕及城墙，为突击部队开辟道路，并能以小组进行连续爆破，以小部队夺取敌人阵地。经过头一阶段的练兵及集中干部三查整训，同时在部队中普遍实行民主，更进一步改善了部队的官兵关系，战士的情绪更加高涨。接着即进入集体的攻坚作战的学习，在学习过程中还结合运城战役的经验总结，提高指战员的攻坚战术思想和战斗动作，全支队举行步、炮、工联合大演习，以实弹射击两个集团地堡和一堵坚固的城墙。演习开始后，山炮距离敌三百米的射程中四发炮弹就摧毁了两个地堡。重机枪开始严密的封锁了高碉的枪眼，步兵就冒着火网连续爆破。仅二十分钟，两个集团工事已被完全摧毁。这时在我强大火力掩护下，爆破小组继续爆破，霎时两丈宽深的外壕扫为平坡，坚固的城墙在烟尘中便裂开了八公尺的一个缺口，突击队员争先冲入，尘土尚未消散，一个营的兵力已突入城内，控制了缺口，完全将攻击的城市占领。经过这次演习，全体指战员都亲身体验到在攻坚技术上大大提高了一步，作战情绪空前高涨，准备在攻占敌人残留在我内地的所有据点中大显身手。
