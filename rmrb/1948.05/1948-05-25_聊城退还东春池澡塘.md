[Jilu Yu News] Liaocheng has begun to correct the "leftist" errors in the implementation of its industrial and commercial policies, and has returned the Dongchunchi Bathhouse to its original owner. Liaocheng is a small city with a population of more than 20,000. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, industry and commerce collapsed almost entirely. After liberation in 1946, industry and commerce gradually prospered under the support of the government; however, during the land reform review last year, due to the leadership's lack of understanding of industrial and commercial policies, "leftist" errors were made, and 103 industrial and commercial enterprises were struggled against. Recently, after studying the Central Bureau's instructions on industrial and commercial policies, it was immediately decided to correct the above "leftist" errors. First, the Dongchunchi Bathhouse, which had been struggled against, was returned to its original owner, Wang Donglai. During the return, the four street cadres and the masses who had originally confiscated the bathhouse repeatedly discussed the matter, and the district head repeatedly explained the policy. Finally, a consensus was reached. On the 13th of this month, representatives from each street and district cadres gathered, and not only were the houses and other original items returned, but also the newly added towels, etc., were returned in their original numbers. In addition, 3,000 catties of firewood were extracted to compensate for the losses of the past ten months. Now, representatives of the masses, the district government, and the original owner have jointly inspected everything in the bathhouse, and it has been decided that Wang Donglai will take over and operate it on May 18th. The workers of the bathhouse have also been informed of the reason for returning it to the original owner, so that the workers can also work with peace of mind.

　　聊城退还东春池澡塘
    【冀鲁豫消息】聊城开始纠正执行工商政策上的左倾错误，将东春池澡塘退还原业主。聊城是个两万多人口的小城市。敌伪统治时期，工商业几乎全部垮台。三十五年解放后，在政府扶植下，工商业逐渐繁荣；但在去年土改复查期间，由于领导上对工商政策不了解，犯了左倾错误，把一百零三家工商业斗争了。最近经过研究中央局对工商政策的指示，立即决心纠正以上左倾错误。首先将斗争的东春池澡塘退还原主王东来。退还时，曾经过原来没收澡塘的四个街干部与群众一再讨论，区长一再讲解政策，最后取得一致同意，于本月十三日各街代表及区干部集会，将房子等原物及新添的毛巾等原数退还外，又抽出三千斤柴赔偿十个月来的损失。现已经过群众代表、区政府与原业主共同到澡塘点验一切东西，决定五月十八日由王东来接收经营；并给澡塘工人说明退还原主的道理，使工人也安心工作。
