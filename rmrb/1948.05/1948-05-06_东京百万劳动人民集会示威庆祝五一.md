Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: A comprehensive dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese people held a large-scale demonstration to celebrate May Day. One million laborers in Tokyo held a grand rally in front of the Imperial Palace to celebrate their festival. Representatives of the Japanese progressive trade unions and democratic organizations delivered speeches one after another, sharply criticizing the anti-popular policies of the reactionary Ashida government. The congress unanimously passed a resolution, emphasizing that a united front of urban and rural laborers must be established, as well as a national federation of trade unions. It also demanded that the government must stop its oppression and retaliatory policies against the working class, stipulate the minimum living standards for the Japanese people, and implement land reform. The resolution also called on the Japanese working class to unite with the working class and laboring people of the world, and to stand at the forefront of the struggle for the reconstruction of an independent, democratic, and peaceful new Japan. After the meeting, a demonstration was held, with some Korean people also participating. Although MacArthur sent out aircraft and armored vehicles to threaten the crowd, and American troops assisted thousands of Japanese military police to disperse the masses, the mighty procession still marched through the streets of Tokyo for three hours. Demonstrations were also held simultaneously in other regions. In Kanagawa Prefecture, 175,000 people participated, and in Osaka, there were 50,000 people. In Kobe, 20,000 demonstrators bravely took to the streets to march, despite the authorities' curfew. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Oppose War," "Strive for World Peace," and "Down with the Ashida Government!" Another dispatch: The laboring people of Indonesia and India also held grand demonstrations to celebrate "May Day."
