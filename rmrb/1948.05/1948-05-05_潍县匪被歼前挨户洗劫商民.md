Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st: Frontline reporters report: Before the annihilation of the Chiang bandits in Weixian City, they set fire to the four gates and looted merchants and civilians house by house. From the 9th to the 17th, for nine days, the fire engulfed the four gates. The Tobacco Company in the South Gate burned for five days and nights, and all kinds of buildings were destroyed. Now, no complete house can be found in the area near the South Gate Railway Station, only four broken houses remain in Yujiazhuang in the West Gate, and Kangjiazhuang has become a field of rubble. According to Wang Fangqu, who originally ran the "Qingzhou Inn" near the railway station: After the battle in the city began, the bandit army forced merchants and civilians to leave their homes empty-handed and set fire to the houses. At that time, Wang and his son knelt down and begged to take some clothes and utensils, but the bandit army sternly refused, claiming: "We are under the order of Commander Chen (referring to Chen Jincheng, the commander of the defending bandit 45th Division), to burn everything." The bandits took the opportunity to loot house by house, and forced merchants and civilians to build fortifications for them. Wang's youngest son, who was only fourteen years old, was taken away. Wang also witnessed a peddler being shot and killed by the Chiang bandits because he was exhausted and unable to bear the hard labor. The bandit army took advantage of the fire to loot, and all the goods and assets of the shops along the street were looted, even the kettle of the cake and noodle shop was taken away. The Chiang bandits not only set fires, but also indiscriminately bombed with planes. At dawn on the 16th, when some residents of the southwest gate fled to Kangjiazhuang, they were bombed and strafed by bandit planes, killing more than ten people. A woman surnamed Wang died with her baby in her arms. At that time, the situation was truly a living hell on earth. Now the broad masses of Weicheng are filing accusations with the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government, demanding severe punishment for the bandit leaders who committed atrocities.

　　潍县匪被歼前挨户洗劫商民
    【新华社华东前线一日电】前线记者报导：潍县城关蒋匪被歼前，纵火焚烧四关，挨户洗劫商民。自九日至十七日九天内，四关大火弥漫。南关烟草公司曾延烧五昼夜未熄，各种建筑均遭焚毁。现南关车站一带已找不出一间完整房屋，西关于家庄仅余四间破屋，康家庄已成一片瓦砾场。据原在火车站附近开设“青洲客栈”的王芳渠称：城关战斗开始后，匪军即强令商民空手离家，点火烧房。当时王氏父子跪求带些衣服用具，匪军严予拒斥声称：“我们奉陈师长（即城内守匪整四十五师师长陈金城）命令，叫把什么都烧光。”匪徒们却借此挨户洗劫，并驱逼商民为其修筑工事。王之幼子年仅十四岁，即被抓去。王并曾目睹一小贩因精疲力竭不胜苦役，竟遭蒋匪击毙。匪军乘火抢劫，沿街各商号货物资产均全部抢光，即饼面铺之水壶亦被抢走。蒋匪不仅放火，飞机又复滥施轰炸，十六日拂晓，西南关一部居民逃至康家庄时，即被匪机投弹扫射，炸死十余人。一王姓妇女死后怀里还抱着婴儿。当时情形，真是人间活地狱。现潍城广大群众正纷纷向解放军及民主政府提出控诉，要求严惩暴行匪首。
