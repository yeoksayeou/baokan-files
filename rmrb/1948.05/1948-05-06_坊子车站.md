　　Fangzi is located twenty-four li southeast of Weixian city. It is known as one of the four major stations on the Jiaoji Railway. It is a famous coal mining area, producing 500 tons of coal per day. The urban area has a 1,500 kilowatt power plant, a tobacco company, an auto repair shop and other enterprises, as well as electricity, telephone, and running water facilities. After the People's Liberation Army recovered Fangzi on April 11, the first thing they did was to prevent the destruction of industry and commerce. The heads of the industrial, mining, transportation, and cultural and educational sections under the Provisional Military Control Commission carried out safekeeping and registration.
    All private enterprises and property were fully protected. Sun, the director of the Fangzi Works Section, had fled. His small-scale machine repair shop, after being registered, was entrusted to someone for proper care. At the Sanma Road Jingwen Bookstore, a notice from the Municipal Garrison Command was posted at the entrance: "If the original owner is not present, no one is allowed to touch any stationery in the counter." The bookstore door was wide open, and steel pens, ink, notebooks, and books were still arranged in the glass cabinet. The People's Liberation Army comrades, who were most fond of running to bookstores and stationery stores, walked away after seeing the notice. In the Cultural and Educational Department of the Military Control Commission, the staff patiently registered some clothes, bedding, leather shoes, and utensils left behind by teachers and staff. According to the staff, these items will be handed over to the owners one by one when they return, returning everything intact.
    On the 17th, the government convened a symposium with more than 300 representatives from all walks of life. Feng Ping, a representative of the East China Finance Office and the Shandong Democratic Provincial Government, announced the general policy for the construction and development of the city, and specifically explained the policies towards the city and the attitude towards people from all walks of life. The Industry and Commerce Bureau also transported a large amount of grain, oil, and salt from the interior, and prices generally fell. On the 19th, wheat fell from 800 yuan per jin to 640 yuan, sorghum fell from 650 yuan per jin to 550 yuan, soybean oil fell from 4,000 yuan per jin to 3,200 yuan, and table salt fell from 430 yuan per jin to 180 yuan. The market is now becoming more active, and the credit of the North Sea currency is increasing day by day. The exchange rate with the Kuomintang currency has increased from one to fifty to one to sixty. Various manufacturers and coal mines are vigorously resuming business. The Huachang Coal Mining Company sold 50,000 jin of coal on the 19th.

　　坊子车站
    坊子在潍县城东南二十四里，号称胶济铁路四大车站之一，是著名煤矿区，日产煤五百吨。市区有一千五百千瓦的发电厂，烟草公司，汽车修理厂等企业，以及电灯、电话、自来水等设备。四月十一日解放军收复坊子后，第一件事就是防止对工商业的破坏，临时军事管制委员会所属工矿、交通、文教等部分头进行着保管与登记。
    一切私人企业和财产都受到周全保护，坊子工务段长孙某跑了，他开设的小规模机器修理厂经登记后，已托人妥为代管。三马路经文书店，大门口贴着市卫戍司令部布告：“原主人不在，柜内文具一概不准动。”该店大门敞开，玻璃柜里仍排列着钢笔、墨水、笔记本和书籍等，最喜欢往书店文具店跑的解放军同志，看看布告就走开了。在军管会文教部里，工作人员不厌其烦的登记着教职员私人遗留下来的一些衣服、被褥、皮鞋和用具等杂物，据工作人员说，这一些东西待物主回来时一一点交，原璧奉还。
    十七日政府曾召开了各阶层人士三百余代表的座谈会，华东财经办事处及山东民主省府代表冯平宣布建设与发展城市的总方针，并具体解释对城市各项政策及对各阶层人民的态度。工商局并从内地运来大批粮食、油、盐，物价普遍下降。十九日小麦由每斤八百元降至六百四十元，高粱由每斤六百五十元降至五百五十元，豆油由每斤四千元降至三千二百元，食盐由每斤四百三十元降至一百八十元。现市面已日趋活跃，北海币信用日高与蒋币比值由一比五十提高到一比六十。各厂商煤矿正大力恢复营业。华昌煤矿公司十九日即脱售煤五万斤。
