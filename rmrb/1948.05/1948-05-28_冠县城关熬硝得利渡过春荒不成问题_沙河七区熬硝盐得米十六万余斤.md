Guancheng Township's Success in Boiling Niter Solves Spring Famine Issue
Shahe Seventh District Extracts 160,000 Catties of Rice Worth of Salt from Boiling Niter

[Guancheng News] Guancheng Township has a small amount of land, and many people do small business. In recent years, it has suffered from enemy and puppet (government) ravages, coupled with consecutive years of poor harvests. Small business is also failing, and many people have no food to eat. Last winter, the government provided a loan of 2,735,000 yuan to support the township people's sideline production, calling on them to boil niter. The people were afraid that it would not be profitable and were unwilling to do it. Later, the Niter and Sulfur Bureau personally organized it, and also sent two technicians. Village cadres and teachers also helped. From November last year to April this year, 517 groups were organized in the city. At first, they still didn't have much confidence, but later they saw results and became more and more enthusiastic. In less than five months, they boiled 16,379 catties of niter. Each catty averaged 720 yuan, for a total of more than 11,790,000 yuan. In April, a total of 567 people in Guancheng Township boiled 4,226 catties of niter, earning a net profit of more than 26,000 catties of rice, worth more than 5,200,000 yuan, after deducting firewood and lamp oil. This was more than 1,000 catties of niter more than last month. Cheng Dexing's group of six people boiled more than 2,300 catties of niter and had more than 50 *linzi* of soil left (each *linzi* produces more than 20 catties of niter), and more than 300 catties of niter dregs. His six families not only had enough to eat, but also had money left over. Last year, the six families were raising two small animals, and this year each family has one. They said that if they hadn't scraped niter, they wouldn't have been able to afford those two animals. Now they are even more enthusiastic. Seeing such results, those who didn't scrape soil in the past all regretted it. Now, those who are scraping soil are living very well, and many who are not scraping soil have nothing to eat. Based on this situation, the government gave another loan of 5,875,000 yuan to the needy households in Guancheng Township to help them get through the spring famine, calling on them to boil niter. The people saw with their own eyes that boiling niter was very profitable, and they were all willing to do it. Because the people had no capital, the Niter Bureau advanced rice to the people, requiring them to hand over niter within a certain period. Therefore, more than 80% of the households in the city started scraping niter soil. People are scraping niter every night. In May, they pre-borrowed a total of more than 100,000 catties of rice from the Niter Bureau, and another 2,430,000 yuan, to deliver more than 20,000 catties of niter within a month. The people were even more motivated after receiving the rice. For example, Yang Ba Niang, an old lady in her seventies on West Street, scraped on her knees and scraped a *linzi* in four days. Four or five children, five or six years old, on North Street couldn't scrape, so they swept with brooms. It is truly that men, women, old and young are all working together. Now there is no one starving in Guancheng Township, and getting through the spring famine is no longer a problem. (Shen Yaojiang)

[Shahe News] Shahe Seventh District was originally a niter and salt (small salt) producing area. Before the incident (Japanese Invasion), the old government and the Japanese invaders, after occupying Shahe, strictly prohibited the boiling of niter. No one dared to do it. A few, driven by the need to make a living, would secretly do it once in a while at night. After the establishment of the Shahe Niter and Sulfur Bureau, in order to support and develop the people's boiling of niter and leaching of salt, it first took out 80,000 catties of millet to lend to the people. At this time, the people gratefully said: "In the past, the enemy forbade us to do it and smashed our niter pots and carts. Now the government lends us rice first and asks us to boil niter. How good is that!" It also appropriately solved the issue of workers' wages, stipulating that first-class niter was six catties of rice per catty, second-class five and a half catties of rice, and third-class five catties. Because at the beginning it was limited to mobilization and calls, and the work was not widespread, later it focused on organization and leadership, advocating masters to teach apprentices. Niter producing villages established labor union groups of varying numbers and four niter and sulfur cooperatives. The niter and sulfur cooperatives were responsible for collecting and transporting niter, helping the people exchange for rice, and solving the difficulties of the people in selling. The labor union group leaders and technical experts also played a considerable leadership role. For example, Liu Lao You from Qingjie Village led forty or so workers, helping teach everyone to recognize soil and watch the fire. This spring, he has already boiled 800 catties of niter (excluding salt). Boiling niter is very profitable. Yan Ci of Gao Village boiled 35 catties of niter and extracted six catties of salt in six days. After deducting wages, firewood, water, glue, transportation costs, and other expenses, he can still earn a net profit of twelve catties of millet. According to preliminary statistics, the niter and sulfur production in the Seventh District in the past five months, with light fire niter produced at 23,000 catties. Including transportation costs, the people have profited a total of 167,300 catties of rice. This spring's niter and salt production in the Seventh District not only solved the difficulties of the spring famine, but also greatly supported agricultural production.

　　冠县城关熬硝得利渡过春荒不成问题
  　沙河七区熬硝盐得米十六万余斤
    【冠县消息】冠县城关因为地少作小买卖的很多，这几年来敌伪蹂躏，又加年年歉收。作小买卖也不行，很多群众没饭吃。去冬政府贷款二百七十三万五千元支持城关群众的副业生产，号召熬硝，群众怕不赚钱，不愿干，后经硝磺局亲自组织，还派了两个技师，村干教员也帮助，从去年十一月到今年四月，城内组织了五百一十七个。起初仍没大信心，后来见有成绩，就越干越有劲。不到五个月，就熬了一万六千三百七十九斤火硝。每斤平均七百廿元，共卖了一千一百七十九万余元。城关四月份全月共五百六十七人，熬火硝四千二百二十六斤，除烧柴灯油外，净赚米二万六千余斤，合款五百二十万余元，比上月多出一千多斤火硝。程德兴组六个人就熬了两千三百多斤火硝还余下五十淋子土（每淋出廿多斤硝），三百多斤火硝丕子。他六家除全家吃饭外，还余钱。去年六家喂着两个小牲口，今年每家都有一个啦。他们说要不刮硝连那两个牲口也顾不住，现在他们干的更有劲。看到这样成绩，过去没刮土的都很后悔。现在是刮土的生活都很好，没刮土的很多没啥吃。根据这样情况，政府又给城关困难户贷款五百八十七万五千元渡春荒，号召熬硝。群众亲眼看见熬硝赚钱多，都愿熬，硝局也因群众没本钱，预支给群众米限期交硝。因此城内百分之八十以上的户数都刮起硝土来。每天夜里都有人刮硝。五月份就从硝局预支了共十万余斤米，又款二百四十三万余元，定期一月交齐两万余斤火硝。群众支米后劲头更大，象西街七十多岁的老太太杨八娘，跪着刮，四天刮了一淋子。北街有四五个五六岁的小孩刮不动，拿扫帚扫，真是男女老少一齐干。现城关已没有挨饿的，渡春荒已不成问题。（申耀江）
    【沙河消息】沙河七区本来就是一个产硝出盐区（小盐），事变前旧政府及日寇侵占沙河后，严禁熬硝谁想干也不敢干，个别为生活所迫的往往于夜间悄悄干一回。沙河硝磺局成立后，为扶助与发展群众的熬硝淋盐，首先拿出八万斤小米借给群众，这时群众感激的说：“以前敌人禁止不叫咱干，把硝锅小车都给砸了，现在政府先借给咱米叫咱熬硝，这有多好。”又适当的解决了工人工资问题，规定头等硝一斤六斤米，二等五斤半米，三等五斤。因一开始只限于动员号召，干的不普遍，后又着重于组织领导，提倡师傅带徒弟，产硝村便建立起人数不等的工会小组和四个硝磺合作社，硝磺合作社负责收硝运硝，帮助群众兑米，解决群众出卖上的困难。工会小组长主任和技术把式也起了相当的领导作用。如青介村刘老有，领导着四十来个工人，帮教大家认土看火，今春已熬了八百斤硝（盐在外）。燃硝利很大，高村阎此的六天内熬了三十五斤硝出盐六斤，除了工资、柴、水胶、运费等消耗，还能净挣小米十二斤。七区的硝磺产量据五个月内初步统计，光火硝出产二万三千斤，连运费在内，群众共得利米一六七三○○斤。七区今春的硝盐生产，不仅解决了春荒困难，同时对农业生产上起了很大支援作用。
