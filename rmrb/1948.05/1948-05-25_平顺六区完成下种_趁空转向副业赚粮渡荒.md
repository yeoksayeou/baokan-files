[Ping Shun News] The spring plowing and sowing campaign in Ping Shun Sixth District began in mid-April. After 20 days to a month, all of the district’s more than 30,000 mu of paddy, dry, and terraced land were sown. In this year's production, cadres and the masses initially had ideological concerns, and production was left to drift. After two village cadre meetings and four district cadre meetings, negative emotions were overcome, and the later stage went relatively well. The main situations and experiences in this work are as follows:

	I. In villages such as Ku Jun and Jie Pan Jun, because they had a relatively correct understanding of the Land Law and Party Rectification, the masses' production enthusiasm has been high. The cadres felt that it was okay to correct mistakes made in work, and the masses said that cadres are working for us, and who can be without small flaws? Therefore, the cadres dared to lead, and the masses had reliance, so production was good. At the district and village cadre meetings, a clear call was made for all district cadres to learn from them. At the same time, the thought and emotions of lying down and doing nothing were criticized, explaining that not working is compounding mistakes. The obvious contrast between good and bad pointed out the correct path for village cadres.

	II. In villages such as Qi Zi Gou Zhang Jia Ao, production enthusiasm was low at first and then high. Village cadres, with the help of district cadres, made self-criticisms and admitted their mistakes to the masses, and only then did the masses support them. For example, one cadre's mutual aid team did not want him, but after he admitted his mistake, the masses said that if you had done this earlier, you would have joined the team earlier. In particular, in villages such as Qi Zi Gou, after studying Comrade Ren Bishi's report on the criteria for class division, the middle peasants said that they did not meet the conditions for landlords and rich peasants, and only then did they put their hearts down and produce. The widespread study of the Border Region Government's proclamation "whoever sows, reaps" further stabilized everyone's production enthusiasm.

	III. Villages such as Ti Hou improved production enthusiasm after correcting deviations. Households that were struggled against had nothing to eat, and could only take care of their mouths every day, unable to keep up with farming. Grain was borrowed for them during the sowing, and corrections were made to households that were wrongly struggled against, thus promoting production.

	On May 1st, at the district and village cadre meeting, the Central Bureau's instructions on correcting deviations were studied. District cadres reviewed and corrected that it was wrong to blindly discard the old foundations, and that the attitude towards Party member cadres should be "treating the illness to save the person." Through the introduction of the two democratic Party Rectification villages of Hong Ti Guan and Hong Ni, it was explained that if you made a mistake for the sake of work, the masses would definitely distinguish it for you. For example, a Party member in Hong Ti Guan who did not work and adopted an attitude of being a "good old man" was criticized by the masses and given a warning within the Party. This overcame the cadres' concerns such as waiting to step down and waiting to be struggled against, and they actively went to lead production.

	In addition, all villages, based on their specific conditions, turned to sideline production to earn grain to overcome the famine. For example, in Ku Jun, during the sowing, combined with sideline production, 18 people and several livestock earned more than eight shi of rice and more than 200,000 yuan in the 20-day sowing campaign. Now, district cadres have gone to the villages separately to promote sideline occupations combined with correcting deviations. (Wang Changqun)

### 平顺六区完成下种　趁空转向副业赚粮渡荒

　　平顺六区完成下种
  　趁空转向副业赚粮渡荒
    【平顺消息】平顺六区的春耕下种运动是在四月中旬开始的，全区三万余亩水、旱、梯地，经过二十天到一个月时间，全部完成下种。今年生产中，前期是干部群众都存在着思想顾虑，生产自流，经过两次村干部会议和四次区干部会议，研究克服了消极情绪，在后期就比较好了。这段工作中主要有如下几种情况和经验：
    一、如库峻、界畔峻等村，因比较正确的认识了土地法和整党等问题，群众生产情绪一直是高涨的。干部觉得为工作犯了错误改就中，群众说当干部是为咱，谁能没点小毛病，所以干部敢领导，群众有依靠，生产就好。在区村干部会上明确号召全区干部向他们学习，同时又检讨批评了躺倒不动思想情绪，说明不做工作是错上加错，好坏两种显明的对照起来，给村干指出了正确道路。
    二、七字沟张家凹等村，生产情绪是先低后高，村干在区干帮助下，向群众检讨认错，群众才拥护他。如一个干部互助组不要他，他认了错，群众说你要早这样做，也早参加了组。特别是七字沟等村，学习了任弼时同志报告的划阶级标准，中农说我可不够地主富农条件，才把心放下去生产。如中农郝春怀说：要知道是这，可不该浪费哩。普遍学习了边府谁种谁收布告，更安定了大家生产情绪。
    三、梯后等村是经过了纠偏提高了生产情绪。被斗户都是无吃，每天只能顾嘴，赶不上种地，在下种中给他们借了粮食，对错斗户进行了纠正，这样才推动了生产。
    五月一号在区村干部会上学习中央局的纠偏指示，区干部检查纠正了对老基础盲目丢开是不对的，对党员干部应是“治病救人”的态度。又经过虹梯关和虹霓两个民主整党村的介绍，说明为工作犯了错误，群众一定给你分清，如虹梯关一个党员不做工作，老好人态度，受到群众批评和党内警告处分，这样克服了干部等待下台等挨斗等顾虑，积极的去领导生产。
    另外各村都根据本村的具体条件，转向副业生产，赚粮渡灾荒。如库峻在下种中结合了副业生产十八个人，几头牲口在二十天下种运动中，赚米八石多和二十多万元。现区干部又分头到村推动副业结合纠偏。（王长群）
