　　Gleanings from the Liberated Areas
    ◇ After the Northeast People's Liberation Army entered Liaoyang City, it immediately established a democratic municipal government, issued announcements to reassure the people and protect industry and commerce, and immediately organized a patrol team. Social order was completely restored and shops reopened. The owner of a cotton shop in the eastern part of the city was robbed of some money by prisoners, but he did not dare to appeal to the government. After a soldier discovered this, he reported it to his superiors, who found the prisoner and returned all the property. Before entering the city, the People's Liberation Army had strengthened discipline and policy education, putting forward the slogan of "winning both militarily and politically." Therefore, after entering the city, discipline was strict.
    ◇ Poor people's cooperative production is active in Shijiazhuang City. The No. 10 Street Poor People's Cooperative in the first district of the city recently started a small textile factory with a share capital of 10 million yuan to solve the livelihood of poor women in the entire street. The third and fourth street cooperatives in the third district of the city organized poor people to gin cotton and spin yarn, producing 1,000 catties of ginned cotton and more than 40 catties of yarn per day. The towel factory founded by the cooperatives on the first, ninth, and fourth streets at the end of January has now made a net profit of more than 1.3 million yuan. Female worker Ren Shufang and short-term worker Li Xiaoji have achieved better results than ordinary workers and have been rewarded.
    ◇ Since the Didao Coal Mine in Mudanjiang Province launched a meritorious service campaign last November, it has produced 34,400 tons of coal in a 40-day production sprint, exceeding the original task. The tunnel has been extended from 660 meters to 1,166 meters, and 120 workers have made meritorious contributions during the campaign.
    ◇ All workers at the Hegang Coal Mine in Hejiang Province are actively responding to the task of producing 4 million tons of coal in 1948, guaranteeing that this year's coal output must be doubled compared to last year. Since the new year, the coal output of each pit has been increasing day by day. After adjusting the work of the workers, the output of Xingshan No. 2 Pit increased by 70% in the three days from January 15th to 18th.
    ◇ The output of the Helong Coal Mine in Jilin Province has recently increased sharply from 60 tons to 150 tons per day in the Fudong branch mine alone. The Laotougou Coal Mine in Yanji City has recently launched a competition, and labor hero Liu Shiwen has exceeded the original output by 120%.
    ◇ The Liaoning Provincial Postal Administration has developed rapidly and created many new experiences in the issuance of newspapers and military mail by following the mass line. According to the bureau's statistics, more than 14,000 copies of the Liaodong Daily in the South Manchuria area alone are distributed through the post office, and they are generally delivered to rural areas, new districts, and troops, so that newspapers can be seen in almost every village. In the four administrative villages and thirty villages of the Lishugouzi District of Xi'an, there are 118 readers, of which 109 are farmers. In addition to sending out newspapers and collecting payments, various regions also forward some of the readers' feedback to the newspaper office, becoming a convenient bridge between readers and the newspaper. The methods of delivering letters and newspapers in various places generally involve direct delivery from the county to the district, and delivery from the district to the village as soon as they arrive. The delivery in the district and village mostly uses folk transportation organizations, but does not adhere to a fixed method. For military mail work, mobile military post offices are set up on the main force lines, and front-line post offices are set up in areas close to the front lines. Personnel are increased or decreased at any time depending on the movement of the troops and the length of the route to ensure the connection between the command organs and the rear, and to deliver newspapers and letters to the troops in a timely manner. The front-line post office is also responsible for establishing local post offices with the army in newly recovered areas.
