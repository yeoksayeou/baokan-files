    Taihang News: The Chiang bandits in northern Henan are frantically killing, looting, and conscripting soldiers, committing heinous crimes in Bo'ai. On April 23rd, the entire 317th Regiment, parts of the 115th Regiment, and parts of the 318th Regiment of the Chiang bandits' 43rd Division from Jiaozuo, Wuzhi, and Daiwang in northern Henan, combined with Wang Delin's eight large local tyrant brigades from Bo'ai, totaling more than 5,000 men, attacked my Bo'ai county seat in three routes. Most of the masses and organizations moved outside the city to persist in guerrilla warfare. The enemy occupied the county seat at around 11:00 AM and fled back to their original locations in a disarray by dawn on the 24th. During this short period, the masses in the Chengguan district of Bo'ai and parts of the fourth and fifth districts suffered great disasters due to poor preparations. The enemy went to 32 villages, capturing 415 people, killing 6, wounding 4, and looting 189 livestock and many clothes, quilts, rice, wheat, farm implements, vehicles, cotton, Ji banknotes, pigs, sheep, and chickens. After the enemy fled, our agencies immediately entered the city to carry out relief work. For the thousand or so people severely affected by the disaster who had nothing to eat, in addition to the streets and lanes finding ways to solve the problem of life, the government allocated 8,000 jin of grain to provide relief and support the victims' production. During our comfort work, the men and women of the masses accused and denounced the Chiang bandits. It is said that before the enemy's looting, they deceived the people, saying: "Don't be afraid, we are robbing the Eighth Route Army's public property." But after entering any large or small business shop, they said it was a cooperative public property. When they saw young women, they said you are a women's team leader or chairman. When they saw young men, they said you are a militia or Eighth Route Army soldier. When they saw older men, they said they were the peasant association chairman or production committee cadres. When they saw children, they said they were children's corps Little Eighth Route Army soldiers. First, they threatened the masses, and then they began to loot and conscript soldiers. Taking the city as an example, each family was robbed at least once, and some were looted 17 or 18 times, causing chaos and leaving houses empty. The most cruel thing is: Hu Chang, a poor peasant in the tenth street, who is 15 years old, was forced by the enemy to become a soldier. He said, "I would rather die than be your soldier." The enemy shot the 15-year-old youth to death, dug out one of his eyes with a bayonet, and stabbed him several times. Lin Chunfeng, a middle peasant in the tenth street, who is in his thirties, was seized by the enemy to be a soldier. He resolutely refused to do it. The enemy sent a class of people to beat him in turns, and then changed a platoon of people to beat him, beating him until his head was broken and bleeding, and he fainted on the ground. The enemy chopped off the index finger and middle finger of Lin Chunfeng's left hand, saying, "If you don't become a soldier, I will make you disabled for the rest of your life." When we entered the city and discovered this, we specially invited Dr. Wang from Jianmin Hospital to give him emergency treatment, and now he can eat and talk. Zhang Xiulan, a young woman in Gao Miao in the first district, was strangled to death by the enemy with a rope and shot four or five times in the stomach. Liu Jide, a poor peasant in Nanguan, was stabbed to death by the enemy and thrown into a well. Two 15-year-old girls from the ninth and fourth streets in the city were raped by the enemy. Another woman in the fourth street went mad due to being raped by the enemy. Niu Keliang in the fifth street is a clock repairman. The enemy searched his watch shop 17 or 18 times, subjecting him to various tortures such as hanging and pressing with a lever, and robbing him of more than 30 clocks of various sizes. Even the hair clippers commonly used by barbers were robbed of 14, causing these people who live by their craft to immediately lose their livelihoods and stop working to starve. What is even more inhumane is that the Chiang bandit army defecated everywhere in the rice bowls while escaping. The masses are universally scolding: "Dog b*tch @① Xiang Ma’s prostitute bandits, they harm the people like this, they have no reason not to fail." The people are demanding revenge against the enemy. Now, after our relief work, the masses have further actively launched guerrilla warfare and are carrying out production for self-help.

    豫北敌疯狂抢劫抓丁
    博爱备战不好遭受损失
    【太行消息】豫北蒋匪疯狂杀人抢劫抓叮在博爱制造滔天罪行。四月廿三日，豫北焦作、武陟待王之蒋匪四十三师三一七团全部、一一五团、三一八团各一部，结合博爱土顽王德林八个大队共计五千多人，分三路向我博爱县城进攻。大部群众及机关团体转移城外，坚持游击战争。敌人十一时许侵占县城，廿四日天明狼狈逃回原地。在此短短时间，博爱城关区及四、五区部分村庄，因备战不好，群众遭到很大灾害。敌人共到村庄卅二个，抓去群众四百一十五人、打死六人、打伤四人、抢牲畜一百八十九头和许多衣服、被子、米、麦、农具、车辆、棉花、冀钞、猪、羊、鸡。敌逃窜后，我各机关立即进城进行善后工作，对受灾严重，当下无吃的千余群众，除本街巷自行设法解决生活问题外，政府特拨粮八千斤予以救济，扶持灾民生产。在我们进行安抚工作当中，男女群众纷纷控诉，痛骂蒋匪。据称：敌人此次抢劫之前，曾向老百姓进行欺骗：“不要害怕，我们抢的是八路军公家的东西。”但在进入任何一个大小商号店铺后，一开口就说道是合作社公家的。见到青年妇女便说你是妇女队长、主席，见青年男人就说你是民兵、八路军，见年纪较大的男人说是农会主席、生产委员等干部，见儿童说是儿童团小八路。首先给群众以威胁，继之就动手抢劫、抓丁。单以城内来说，各家至少遭劫一次，有的被洗劫十七、八次，弄得鸡飞狗惊，十室十空。最残忍的是：十街贫农胡长，现年十五岁，敌强迫他当兵，他说：“我死也不干你这兵”。敌人便将这个十五岁的青年用枪打死，并用刺刀挖出一个眼睛，身上连刺数刀。十街中农林春风，卅多岁，敌抓他当兵，他坚决不干，敌派一班人轮打后，又换一排人去打，将他打的头破血流，晕倒地上，并将林春风的左手食指、中指用刀砍下，说：“你不当兵，叫你一辈子残废。”当我们进城发现这事后，特请健民医院王医生急救，现已能吃东西能说话。一区高庙青年妇女张秀兰被敌用绳勒死，并在肚上连打四五枪。南关贫农刘集德被敌刺死后，扔进井里。城内九街、四街十五岁的两个幼女被敌强奸。四街另一妇女因被敌强奸，至今气疯成病。五街牛克良是修理钟表的人，敌曾对他表铺进行十七、八次搜索，对他用吊打压杆种种酷刑，抢走大小钟表三十多个。连理发工人常用的推剪亦抢去十四把，使这些靠手艺过活的人们马上失去生活，停业挨饿。蒋匪军更无人性的是在逃跑时到处把屎拉在吃饭的碗里。群众普遍在骂：“狗ｂī＠①向马娼子土匪，这样苦害老百姓，它就没有不败的道理。”人民都要求向敌报仇。现经我们进行善后工作，群众已进一步积极开展游击战，并进行生产自救。
