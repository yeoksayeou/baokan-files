　　There Must Be Slight Exploitation to Be Considered a Prosperous Middle Peasant
Editor:
    Our method of class division here, in terms of the possession of productive resources, namely land, uses the village's average yield per person as the standard. Those exceeding this average by one-tenth are classified as prosperous middle peasants, and those falling short by one-tenth are classified as poor peasants (also considering the usage). Prosperous middle peasants are not necessarily required to have exploitation. However, the People's Daily on May 3rd, page 2, stated: "There must be slight exploitation to be classified as a prosperous middle peasant; one cannot solely consider land exceeding the average or solely consider a prosperous life." Central documents also state that those whose exploitation income does not exceed one-quarter of their total income are prosperous middle peasants. Furthermore, central documents state: "The boundaries of each class's possession of productive resources cannot and need not be uniformly numerically defined." Therefore, the document only broadly stipulates the possession status: rich peasants possess more and better land, middle peasants possess less than rich peasants but more than poor peasants, and poor peasants have little or no land. Is our standard acceptable? If not, what more specific standards can be used as the boundary for the possession of productive resources? Additionally, is it correct not to classify prosperous middle peasants as a separate category (only classifying middle peasants)? Is it necessary to list all land and property, including land plots, when posting the results? Can someone with exceptionally abundant land and a prosperous life not be called a prosperous middle peasant? (The Central Bureau's instructions state: "Prosperous middle peasants with slight exploitation should still be counted as prosperous middle peasants," indicating that those without exploitation are also considered prosperous middle peasants).
    The above standard for our class division is based on the decision of the Taihang First Prefectural Committee. It was learned during the last rectification, at which time the new central documents had not yet been issued. Later, the new documents were issued, but the higher-ups did not mention any corrections. We are unsure whether this instruction aligns with the spirit of the new documents and request that you inform us in your reply.

    Comrade Leng Zhongming:
    The standard for class division primarily uses people's relationship to the ownership of production, the relationship of production, as the sole standard. Your standard for class division only looks at the possession of the means of production, while ignoring the relationship between the possession of the means of production and its use, exploitation and being exploited. This method of only looking at possession and not exploitation is inconsistent with the spirit of the central standard for class division.
    The central document on class division standards clearly defines the prosperous middle peasant. Chapter Nine, Section Two, states: "Middle peasants who live prosperously and whose income from exploitation does not exceed one-quarter of their total income are called prosperous middle peasants." Therefore, it is said that prosperous middle peasants must have slight exploitation, and one cannot solely rely on land exceeding the average or solely on a prosperous life to classify prosperous middle peasants. Your classification standard, where those exceeding the village average yield by one-tenth are prosperous middle peasants and those falling short by one-tenth are poor peasants, is incorrect and should be corrected immediately. The central documents are not merely broad stipulations, as you say. Please study Chapters Seven, Sections Five, Six, and Seven on the distinctions between old-style rich peasants and prosperous middle peasants, and Chapter Nine on middle peasants, and Chapter Ten on poor peasants in detail, as they are clear and explicit.
    As for how to write the postings, it can be discussed and handled with the masses.

### 一定要有轻微剥削才能算富裕中农

　　一定要有轻微剥削才能算富裕中农编辑同志：
    我们这里划阶级的方法在生产资料的土地的占有上，以全村每人平均产量为标准，往上超过该平均数十分之一者为富裕中农，往下少过十分之一者为贫农（另外也看使用状况），富裕中农不一定要有剥削。但人民日报五月三日第二版上却说：“一定要有轻微剥削，才能划为富裕中农，不能只看土地超过平均数或只看生活富裕。”中央文件上也说剥削收入不超过总收入四分之一者为富裕中农。另外中央文件上说：“各阶层占有生产资料的界限，则不可能也不需要作出一个统一的数字的规定。”故文件只概括的规定占有状况是：富农占有较多较好的土地，中农比富农少、比贫农多，贫农则没有或很少。我们上面的标准是否可以？不然，以什么较为具体的标准为生产资料占有的界限呢？另外，划阶级中不划富裕中农一项是否对（只划中农）？出榜时将全部土地财产并连地块也写上是否有这种必要？土地特别多，生活富裕也不能叫作富裕中农吗？（中央局指示中说：“富裕中农中有轻微剥削者，仍应算作富裕中农”，可见无剥削者也算富裕中农）。
    上述我们划阶级的标准是根据太行一地委的决定。在上次整编时学习的，当时中央新文件未下来。后新文件下来了，上面也未说改正，不知此项指示与新文件精神是否符合？亦请来信告知。

    冷仲明同志：
    划分阶级的标准，首先以人们生产资料的占有关系，以人们的生产关系为唯一的标准。而你们的划阶级标准，只是看生产资料的占有，而忽略了占有生产资料之使用关系，剥削与被剥削，这样只看占有不看剥削的划法，与中央划阶级标准之精神是不合的。
    在中央划分阶级标准文件中，关于富裕中农说的很清楚。第九章第二节中说：“生活富裕，而剥削收入不超过其总收入四分之一的中农，叫做富裕中农。”所以说，富裕中农一定要有轻微剥削，不能只看土地超过平均数或只看生活富裕来划富裕中农的。如你所划之标准，以全村平均产量向上超过十分之一为富裕中农，向下少十分之一为贫农，这是错误的，应立即纠正。中央文件，并不是你所说的，只是概括规定。请将七章五、六、七节中旧式富农和富裕中农的区别，九章中农，十章贫农，详加研究，那里面说的很清楚明确。
    至于出榜时怎样写，可和群众研究处理。　　　　　　——编者
