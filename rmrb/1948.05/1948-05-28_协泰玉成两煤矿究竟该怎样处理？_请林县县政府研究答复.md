　　How Should the Xieta and Yucheng Coal Mines Be Handled?
　　Please Provide a Study and Reply from the Lin County Government

　　To the Editor:
　　In the autumn of 1945, the Lin County Government confiscated the Xieta and Yucheng coal mines due to the levying of burdens, turning them into publicly run enterprises. The simple course of events at the time was as follows: the factory believed that the assessed burden amount was too large (the exact amount is unknown) and the deadline was too short, making it difficult to pay. Xieta Coal Mine, in particular, faced even greater difficulties and repeatedly requested a reduction, explaining their plight. At the time, the enemy was rumored to be launching a large-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas, and the government believed that the factory was intentionally resisting payment and attempting to delay until the enemy arrived, at which point the payment could be avoided. Therefore, the manager of Xieta, Li Xiaokui, was suddenly detained, and people were sent to manage the two coal mines on behalf of the government, stating that they would be returned after the burden was paid. With Li detained, they were unsure of the government's attitude. The remaining managers either fled to enemy-controlled areas or went into hiding, not daring to show their faces and abandoning the mines. Because Li himself was unable to pay the full burden and saw that others were not managing the situation, in the spring of 1946, he used the coal mine's production tools and all stored goods to offset the cost. The government's calculation method was to convert the assessed amount into grain based on the grain price at the time of assessment, and then convert the grain amount back into currency based on the current price to pay. The mine's machinery, tools, coal, and all goods were individually valued. If the total value exceeded the total burden, the remainder would still belong to the factory. However, during the actual valuation, the government executors intentionally suppressed the prices of various items to ensure they matched the total burden amount. In this way, the two coal mines were transformed from private enterprises into publicly operated ones. These two mines were formerly the Fuxing Coal Mine led by Li Guangzhu, established in the 12th or 13th year of the Republic of China [1923-1924]. In the early years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the leaders and operators split into two groups, each adding new shareholders, and operated in two locations: Madian and Tielu villages, moved from the Tuzhai River ditch. They still maintained some connections, and to outsiders, it appeared as if they were still one entity, but formally, they were in two separate locations. The mine had approximately one hundred shareholders, most of whom were middle peasants, except for a few larger shareholders who were landlords. Some of the larger shareholders were traitors (I know of one).

　　According to the spirit of our current policies, in addition to legally dealing with the shareholders who were traitors, should this situation be rectified? Please reply. (You Ren)

　　协泰玉成两煤矿究竟该怎样处理？
  　请林县县政府研究答复编辑同志：
    林县县政府于四五年秋，因征收负担，将协泰、玉成两煤矿没收，变成了公办。当时简单经过情形是：派的负担款厂方认为数目太大（数目不详），且限期较短，感到无力缴纳，特别协泰煤矿比较更困难，屡次请求减少，申述他们的苦衷。恰当时正值敌人声言要用大军向解放区进攻，政府认为是厂方有意抵抗交款，企图拖延时间，如敌人来了，此款可以免出。于是突然将协泰经理李孝逵扣押，派人代管了两家煤矿，声言交了负担以后退还。李既被扣，他们对政府态度摸不着头脑，其余经理有的逃往敌区，有的躲藏起来不敢露面，都不管了。李自己无力交出全部负担，见他人不管，于是于四六年春，用煤矿生产工具及存的一切物品估价抵价，计算方法政府是将派款数以派时的粮价把款折成粮数，再以折成的粮食石数，按现在价格折成款数交纳。矿上的机器、工具、煤及一切物品是按件数一一估价，如总值超过了负担总额下余的仍归厂方所有，但实际估价时政府的执行人有意的将各种物品价格压低，造成符合负担的总数，就这样将两煤矿由私营变成了公家经营了。此两矿的前身是李光祝所领导的阜兴煤矿，开办于民国十二、三年，抗战初年领导经营的人分成了两部，都各增加了一些新的股东，分成两处经营，由土寨河沟移到马店、铁炉两村，中间仍互有关系，在外人看来好象还是一家似的，不过在形式上在两处就是了。该矿的股东约有一百来户，除几个较大的股东是地主外，大部都是中农成份，个别的大股东有当了汉奸的（我知道的有一个）。
    照今天我们政策的精神，除了把当汉奸的股东依法处理外，是否也应该纠正呢。？请复。（幽人）
