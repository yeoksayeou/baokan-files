　　We must cherish the livestock we raise collectively.
  　It's a pity so many animals died in Dongdatian Village.
    [Yongnian News] Dongdatian Village, Yongnian District, has 57 hectares of land and 30 head of livestock. Each head of livestock needs to cultivate an average of 1.9 hectares of land, which is too little livestock. However, recently another five head have died. The circumstances of their deaths are as follows: For example, Zhang Erheshang and Jia Jinsheng collectively fed an ox, which died from a leg injury sustained when it fell over at night due to being too thin. Pian Jili and others collectively fed an ox, which also died because it was too thin. Old Zhang Pian drove it to the field, where it lay down and couldn't get up. You Changgui and three other families borrowed money to collectively buy an ox that was thin and sick, which died before it could do any work. Cui Jinxiao's donkey went to Xingtai, where it was carelessly exposed to the wind and died. Another family, relatives of an army dependent, borrowed a thin and sick ox from relatives, which also lay down and couldn't get up before it could do any work.
    Some say the deaths were due to "a livestock plague, spreading among the animals," but in reality, it's because the livestock are not being cared for properly. When it's someone's turn to feed the collectively raised livestock, they just use them relentlessly. They don't feed them properly. Some people, knowing it will be someone else's turn to feed the livestock the next night, don't feed them because the fodder is too expensive. Over time, the livestock will become weak and die. It is currently spring plowing season, and if the livestock die, the land cannot be planted, grain cannot be produced, and lack of food means famine. Therefore, everyone should pay attention to protecting the livestock. Those who collectively raise livestock should establish rules, specifying how much fodder to feed each day. Whoever's turn it is must feed them well and not use them relentlessly. If they get sick, quickly find a veterinarian to treat them. (You Bo)

### 伙喂牲口都要爱护　东大田村牲口死的太可惜

　　伙喂牲口都要爱护
  　东大田村牲口死的太可惜
    【永年消息】永年一区东大田村，共有地五十七顷，牲口三十头，每头牲口平均需要耕种一顷九十亩地，牲口太少，可是最近又死了五头，死的情况是这样：如张二和尚和贾金声两家伙喂一头牛，因太瘦夜里卧下跌伤腿死了。骈计立等两家伙喂一头牛，也因太瘦，骈老张使到地里卧下起不来死了。由长贵等三家才贷了款伙买来一头又瘦又病的牛，没干活就病死了。崔进孝的一头驴去邢台不注意打了背吃风死了。另外一家抗属从亲戚家借来一头又瘦又病的牛，也是没干活就卧下起不来死的。
    有的说是“牲口有灾，传牲口”死的，实际上是因对牲口太不爱护了，伙喂的牲口，轮到谁家，光恨命的使，不好好的喂，有的今天晚上牲口要轮到别家，因草料很贵，光恨恨的使就不喂了，这样天长日久，牲口就会瘦弱死的。目前正在春耕，牲口死了，地种不上，打不来粮食，没饭吃就是灾荒，所以大家都要注意爱护牲口，伙喂牲口的大家要订个规矩，每天喂多少草料，轮到谁家都要好好的喂，不要恨命的使，有了病，赶快找看牲口的医生治治。　　　（幻博）
