Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Moscow News: After the issuance of the Soviet Union's third phase of Reconstruction and Development New Government Bonds (planned amount of 20 billion rubles) on the 3rd, a patriotic upsurge of subscription swept across the Soviet Union. By the evening of the second day, it had already exceeded the plan, with subscriptions reaching 20.119 billion rubles, and subscriptions are still continuing. Soviet Finance Minister Kosygin wrote an article commenting on the issuance of the new government bonds, saying: Government bonds mobilize the people's savings in order to complete the Five-Year Plan. The Soviet people lending money to the government will greatly improve the material welfare of the Soviet people and make the Soviet Union even stronger in military and economic terms. The Truth Daily editorial pointed out: Soviet government bonds have played a great role in the construction of socialism, and they have become one of the sources of socialist industrialization. Before the war, the people lent 50 billion rubles to the government, and during the Patriotic War, they lent 26 billion rubles to the government. These funds played a significant role in construction and defeating the enemy. Recently, the further reduction of prices and the further increase of the people's actual income, and the accumulation of savings, have created favorable conditions for the issuance of government bonds.

　　全苏人民热烈认购新公债
  　两天便超过了发行额
    【新华社陕北七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联第三期复兴建设新公债（预定额为二百亿卢布）于三日发行后，全苏即涌起认购的爱国热潮。到第二天晚即已超过计划，认购数目已达二百零一亿一千九百万卢布，现认购仍继续中。苏联财长科锡金撰文评论新公债的发行说：公债是把人民的储蓄动员起来，以便完成五年计划。苏维埃人民借钱给政府，将大大提高苏联人民的物质福利，使苏维埃军事和经济方面更形强大。真理报社论指出：苏维埃公债在建设社会主义中曾起了伟大的作用，它已成为社会主义工业化的源泉之一，战前人民贷给政府五百亿卢布，爱国战争中贷给政府二百六十亿卢布，这些资金在建设与击败敌人上起了重大作用。最近，物价的再次减低，人民实际收入的进一步增加，其积蓄随着增长，造成发行公债的有利条件。
