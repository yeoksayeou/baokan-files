Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. Stalin published his reply to Wallace's open letter on the 17th. The full text is as follows:

"In my opinion, among the recent political documents aimed at consolidating peace, promoting international cooperation, and ensuring democracy, Mr. Wallace, the third-party presidential candidate of the United States, has produced the most important document with his open letter. Mr. Wallace's open letter cannot be regarded merely as a declaration of a desire to improve the international situation, to peacefully resolve Soviet-American differences, and to find ways to this resolution. The weakness of the American government's statement on May 4 and the Soviet government's reply on May 9 lies in the fact that, apart from declaring a desire to resolve Soviet-American differences, they do not go any further. The great importance of the open letter lies in the fact that it is not limited to declarations, but goes further, takes a serious step forward, and proposes a concrete plan for the peaceful resolution of Soviet-American differences. It cannot be said that Mr. Wallace's open letter includes all points of contention without exception. Nor can it be said that some propositions and explanations in this open letter do not need to be corrected, but that is not the main thing at present. The main thing is that Mr. Wallace, in his letter, makes an open and honest attempt to put forward concrete proposals for the peaceful resolution of all major Soviet-American differences. These suggestions, as everyone knows, are: universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons; the conclusion of peace treaties with Germany and Japan, and the withdrawal of troops stationed in these countries; the withdrawal of troops stationed in China and Korea; respect for the sovereignty of all countries and non-interference in their internal affairs; prohibition of the establishment of military bases in member states of the United Nations; development of international trade by all possible means, and the elimination of all discrimination; assistance to the economic recovery of countries suffering from war damage within the framework of the United Nations; guaranteeing democracy and guaranteeing the rights of people in all countries, etc. People may agree or disagree with Mr. Wallace's plan. But one thing is beyond any doubt, namely: any politician who cares about the cause of peace and cooperation between nations cannot ignore this plan, because it reflects the hopes and desires of people all over the world to strengthen peace, and will undoubtedly win the support of millions of ordinary people. I do not know whether the US government agrees with Mr. Wallace's plan as a basis for a Soviet-American agreement. As far as the Soviet government is concerned, it believes that Mr. Wallace's plan can serve as a good and fruitful basis for seeking such an agreement and developing international cooperation, because the Soviet government believes that, despite the differences in economic systems and ideology, the coexistence of these systems and the peaceful resolution of Soviet-American differences are not only possible, but also absolutely necessary for the sake of universal peace. Moscow, May 17, 1948."

### 斯大林答复华莱士  华氏方案可作苏美协议基础　它反映着世界人民和平愿望

　　斯大林答复华莱士
    华氏方案可作苏美协议基础
  　它反映着世界人民和平愿望
    【新华社陕北十九日电】斯大林十七日发表对华莱士公开信的答复，全文如下：
    “我认为：在最近以巩固和平、促进国际合作与确保民主为其目的的政治文件中，美国第三党总统候选人华莱士先生的公开信，是最重要的文件。华莱士先生的公开信不能被认为仅只是宣布一个愿望，想改进国际情势，想和平解决苏美间分歧，想为这种解决寻找途径。美国政府五月四日的声明与苏联政府五月九日的复文，两者不够的地方便在于它们除了宣布解决苏美分歧的愿望外，没有更进一步。这对公开信的巨大重要性，便在于它并不限于宣布，而是更进一步，认真向前跨了一步，并且给和平解决苏美间分歧提出一个具体的方案。不能说华莱士先生的公开信已毫无例外地包罗了一切分歧问题。也不能说这封公开信中某些命题与解释已无需改正了，但那不是目前主要的事情。主要的事情是：华莱士先生在其信中作出公开和诚实的尝试，要为和平解决苏美间一切主要分歧问题，提出具体的建议。这些建议大家都知道是：普遍裁减军备与禁止原子武器；缔结对德及对日和约，并撤退驻各该国的军队；撤退驻中国与朝鲜军队；尊重各个国家的主权与不干涉其内政；禁止在联合国的会员国内建立军事基地；以一切可能的方法发展国际贸易，祛除一切歧视；在联合国的范围内援助那些遭受战争损害国家的经济复兴；保证民主并保证一切国家中的人民权利等等。人们可以同意或者不同意华莱士先生的方案。但是，有一件事无论如何是毫无疑问的，即：任何关心各国间和平与合作事业的政治家，都不可能无视这个方案，因为他反映着全世界人民对加强和平的希望与意愿，并且无疑将博得成千百万老百姓的拥护。我不知道美国政府是否赞同华莱士先生的方案作为苏美间协议的基础。就苏联政府来说，它认为华莱士先生的方案，可以作为一个良好而有成果的基础，用以求取这种协议与发展国际合作的，因为，苏联政府认为：尽管经济制度与思想上的不同，但这些制度的并存以及和平解决苏美间分歧，不仅是可能的，而且为了普遍和平的利益，还是绝对必要的。一九四八年五月十七日于莫斯科。”
