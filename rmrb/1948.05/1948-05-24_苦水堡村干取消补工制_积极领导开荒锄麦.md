　　【Jinan News】The village cadres of Kushuibao Village in Qi County voluntarily abolished the past practice of giving work-point subsidies to village cadres. The militia announced that they would no longer allow the masses to cultivate land on their behalf, and instead use mutual aid and exchange labor to solve the problem. Coupled with loans of money and grain, the masses actively bought livestock to reclaim wasteland, adding five oxen at once. In the whole village of over a hundred households, everyone except Bai Fengshi now had an ox. They studied their own methods, with the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned only providing money but not feeding the oxen, pooling 10,000 yuan to manage the work of two mu of land, as well as grinding and milling. Most of the more than ten qing of land that had been abandoned during the famine years has been reclaimed, with more than four qing reclaimed this year alone. The masses voluntarily worked together to reclaim land, with Bai Shuyuan reclaiming twenty mu in a few days. Shi Lanyun, who is over sixty years old, took on the work of fifty mu of land, and also reclaimed seven mu with a child. Currently, all ten qing of wheat in the village have been weeded, and two qing of spring land have been hoed. Some spring seedlings were weeded even before they emerged, which is called "dream weeding," and is also beneficial for weeding the seedlings. The主任 representative also personally went to the homes of landlords and rich peasants to mobilize and urge them, so the wheat of the landlords and rich peasants was also weeded, and the spring land was also planted. The masses also jointly opened a small plank shop, using old fruit, and recovered old loans as capital to buy a lotus tree, which was used to make thirty hoe handles and some iron handles. The masses brought their looms, wheelbarrows, spinning wheels, and production furniture to be repaired. Small jobs were free of charge, which the masses found very convenient. When the plank shop announced that they were pulling trees, people competed to use their own oxen.

　　苦水堡村干取消补工制
  　积极领导开荒锄麦
    【冀南消息】企之县苦水堡村干自动取消过去给村干的补工制，民兵宣布再出发不让群众代耕，用互助换工解决。加上贷款贷粮，群众都积极买牲口开荒，一下添了五个牛。全村百多户，除了白封氏，别人都有了牛腿。自己研究办法，老弱孤寡光出钱不喂牛，凑一万元管二亩地的活和磨碾。灾荒年荒的十几顷地，大部开起，光今年就开了四顷多。群众自愿搁伙去开，白书元几天开了二十亩，六十多的石兰云，顶着五十亩地的活，还和一个小孩又开了七亩。现全村十顷麦子锄完，春地锄了两顷。有的春苗没出就锄草，这叫“梦锄”，对锄苗也有利。主任代表还亲自去到地主富农家里动员督促，所以地主富农的麦子也都锄过来，春地也都种上了。群众还合伙开了一个小板店，有旧果实，收回的旧贷款做本，买了一个莲子树，刮了三十根锄把和一些铁把。群众的织布机、托车、纺花车、生产家具，拿了去就修理。小活不要钱，群众都感到很方便，板店一说拉树，争着叫使自己的牛。　　　　　　　（吕静波）
