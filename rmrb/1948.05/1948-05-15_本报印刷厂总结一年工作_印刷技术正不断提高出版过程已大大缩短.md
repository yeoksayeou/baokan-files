    Our Newspaper Printing Plant Summarizes a Year's Work
    Printing Technology is Continuously Improving, Publishing Process Greatly Shortened
    Our newspaper printing plant recently summarized its work over the past year. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, there have been considerable gains and experience in cultivating and educating workers, improving printing technology, shortening the publishing process, and reducing production costs. This is specifically reflected in:

    (1) Although the number of newspapers distributed has more than doubled compared to a year ago, the number of employees has increased by less than double. The ratio of production personnel to management personnel in the factory is ten to one, achieving a streamlined and rational personnel organization, reducing unnecessary expenses, and maintaining a balanced cost figure despite the continuous rise in prices. To reduce costs, workers increase their working hours to complete certain tasks. For example, when publishing four pages, many departments work for twelve to sixteen hours.

    (2) In terms of technological improvement, looking at work efficiency, the machine department now only needs about 20 minutes to mount plates, shortening the time by 30 to 40 minutes compared to the past. In the typesetting department, the average time for a third-grade, third-level worker to compose and proofread the first edition is 34 minutes. Cui Fengxiu's average time for composing the second edition is one hour and sixteen minutes, both of which are half the time it used to take. In terms of work quality, Cao Youlin, Li Yaotang, Zhao Tiezhu, Zhang Qingde, and other comrades in the typesetting department have a typo rate of 0.1% to 0.25% in draft proofreading, and even general trainees can keep it below 0.7%. On average, the plate-making department can cast eight lead plates from one sheet of rough-edged paper matrix. Recently, workers Tian Zhongyuan, Tian Zhiwen, and others in the department set a new record of casting thirteen lead plates from one paper matrix. These achievements are mainly due to the implementation of quality inspection systems in various departments, publishing process assessment systems, and reward and compensation systems. Over the past year, 46 new workers have been trained and educated.

    (3) In terms of employee education over the past year, struggles have been waged against negative phenomena such as laziness, sabotage of tools, and disruption of production. In the rectification and study, it was not limited to the narrow circle of simply opposing landlord and rich peasant thought, but mainly focused on thoroughly examining various non-proletarian thoughts and work styles. Such as liberalism, economic viewpoints, technological conservatism, seeking fame and position, forgetting one's roots, foreman style, and hooligan habits, which have a corrosive effect on employees. After the study, the factory showed a new atmosphere. Many comrades quickly joined the Party organization, and their class consciousness was universally improved, and their work enthusiasm was brought into play. For example, the call to publish the newspaper one day in advance was completed through everyone's research on overcoming difficulties.

    (4) After studying the "February 7th" editorial, the factory organized a management committee, composed of the director and deputy director, the chairman of the trade union, and the branch secretary. The management committee holds regular meetings to report and review the work of the Party, government, and trade union, make unified arrangements, and implement them separately in factory affairs meetings, branch committees, and employee committees. This ensures that the entire factory's work steps are consistent, thereby improving leadership.

    In addition, there are also some shortcomings: egalitarianism exists in the factory's wage system; equal treatment in life is emphasized, leading to the problem of not increasing wages when they should be increased and not decreasing wages when they should be decreased, so that the wage system has not played its due role in stimulating production and improving technology. Secondly, in the implementation of the inspection, registration, and reward and punishment system, sometimes there is a lack of serious supervision and attention to assessment, resulting in a perfunctory attitude, which has a negative effect on work. In addition, employees also lack a spirit of humbly learning and cannot break out of their fixed technical circles in all aspects, showing conservatism, perfunctoriness, and technical compromise, which have not been completely overcome. The improvement of printing quality and the elimination of typos are still at a certain level. However, everyone is gradually aware that the Party newspaper is the newspaper of the people of the entire region, and also their own newspaper, and is working hard to overcome all difficulties for "faster publishing, better printing, and lower costs."

    本报印刷厂总结一年工作
    印刷技术正不断提高出版过程已大大缩短
    本报印刷厂最近总结一年来的工作。由于全体职工同志的努力，在培养教育工人，提高印刷技术，缩短出版过程，减低生产成本上都有不少收获及经验。具体表现在：
    （一）报纸发行数量，虽较一年前增加了一倍多，而职工人员则较前增添不到一倍。工厂的生产人员和管理人员的比例为十比一，做到了精简合理的人力组织，减缩了不必要的开支，使印刷成本虽在物价的不断上升中，保持了平衡的成本数字。为了减低成本，工人们以增加工作时间来完成一定的任务。如在出四个版时，好多部门工作都在十二小时以至十六小时。
    （二）在技术的提高方面，从工作效率上看，机器部上版时间现在只需二十分钟左右，与过去比较，缩短了三十分到四十分钟。排字部拼版时间，三等三级工人常和英拼第一版平均时间为三十四分钟，崔峰秀拼第二版平均时间为一点又十六分钟，都较前缩短时间一半。从工作质量上看，排字部曹有林、李耀唐、赵铁柱、张庆德等同志排草稿初校错字为千分之一至二·五，一般练习生也能做到不超过千分之七。打版部平均一张毛边纸型可浇版八块，最近该部工人田中元、田治文等又创一张纸型浇十三块铅版之最高记录。这些收获的取得，主要是由于执行了各部门的质量检查制度，出版过程考核制以及奖励与赔偿制度等的结果。一年来，并培养与教育了新生工人四十六人。
    （三）一年来，在职工的教育方面，对一些消极怠工、破坏工具、破坏生产等坏现象作了斗争。在整编学习中，不仅限于单纯的反对地富思想的狭小圈子，而主要地是有重点的清算了各种非无产阶级的思想和作风。如对职工同志起腐蚀作用的自由主义、经济观点、技术保守、闹名位、忘本思想、工头作风与流氓习气等。学习以后的工厂，表现了新的气象，有不少同志很快加入了党的组织，普遍的提高了阶级自觉，发挥了工作积极性。比如报纸提前出版一天的号召，就是在大家研究克服困难下完成的。
    （四）在学习了“二七”社论后，工厂组织了管理委员会，由正副厂长，职工会主任，支书等组成。管理委员会定期开会报告与检讨党政工各方面的工作，作出统一的布置，分别在厂务会议、支部委员会、职工委员会中贯彻执行。这样使全厂工作步骤获得一致，并因此健全了领导。
    另外也还有些缺点：在工厂中存在着工资制度的平均主义；强调了生活的平等待遇，发生该高不高、该低不低的毛病，使工资制度没有起了应有的刺激生产提高技术的作用。其次，在实行检查、登记、奖惩制度中，有时候缺乏认真的督促及注意考核，因此产生了应付的现象，对工作反而起了不好的作用。此外，职工同志还缺乏虚心学习的精神，不能很好的从各方面打破自己固定的技术圈子，表现保守、对付及技术上的迁就等现象，还没有完全加以克服。印刷质量的提高，错字的消灭，也还停留在一定的水平上。不过，大家都逐渐觉悟到党报是全区人民的报纸，也就是自己的报纸，正克服一切困难，为“出版的更快，印刷的更好，与成本的减低”而努力。
