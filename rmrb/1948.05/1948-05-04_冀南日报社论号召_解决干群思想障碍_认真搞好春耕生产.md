　　Jinnan Daily Editorial Calls for Resolving Ideological Obstacles Between Cadres and the Masses and Conscientiously Promoting Spring Farming Production
　　[Jinnan News] To resolve the current ideological chaos and unrest among cadres and the masses, the Jinnan Daily issued an editorial on April 28th, calling on cadres at all levels to break through ideological obstacles, actively work in the urgently needed spring farming production, and organize and lead production responsibly. Correctly implement policies to eliminate the concerns of the masses in production, improve the production enthusiasm of the masses, and lead the broad masses to actively produce. The editorial analyzed the existing ideological obstacles of cadres and the masses today, saying: Since the Party rectification, the work confidence of many county and district cadres has decreased, and they have been cautious and meticulous all day long, daring not to take responsibility. A few cadres are even dissatisfied with the Party, passively sabotaging work, and letting things go with the flow. Because we have not sufficiently publicized and explained the spirit of the Land Law Outline, it has caused confusion in the masses' emotions. In addition, some specific difficulties of the masses have not been well resolved, giving some saboteurs an opportunity to disrupt society and undermine production. In Longyao, many villages created "living gods," and the Youfang Baiyang Ancient Religion in the fourth district of Guangping prepared to riot. County and district cadres did not intervene in the former, and the latter was ignored even when the masses reported to the district, resulting in the masses suffering undue losses. In addition to the ideological problems existing among cadres in general counties and districts, in counties engaged in production, many county and district cadres do not sufficiently recognize the importance of production. Some belittle production and are willing to carry out land reform, while others believe that land reform is important and production is secondary, or that first-class cadres engage in land reform and second-class cadres engage in production. Furthermore, in some counties, some cadres are unwilling to lead production, but instead engage in land reform pilot villages in isolation. In addition, some cadres are comfortable with engaging in production and are willing to engage in production, but do not pay attention to the specific organizational leadership work in production, thinking that the masses will produce on their own, and that the masses will naturally carry out production at each solar term, without the need for much concern.
　　In the minds of ordinary village cadres and Party members, because they do not understand the spirit of Party rectification, most are passively sabotaging work, waiting for Party rectification to pass, not intervening in matters, and not solving problems, fearing to offend the masses and receive criticism in the future, holding the idea that it is better to do less than to do more. Good village cadres and Party members feel wronged and are not in high spirits; those with minor mistakes are willing to speed up Party rectification, and once it is over, they will have no worries; a few with more and more serious mistakes show panic and attempt to cover up their mistakes. The editorial pointed out that solving the ideological obstacles of village cadres and Party members is an important link that urgently needs to be solved in today's production. Otherwise, the state of anarchy below cannot be overcome, and production in various villages cannot be promoted. The solution is that Guangzong and other places have run training classes for village cadres and Party members, and Wei County, Qinghe and other counties have held short-term training sessions for village cadres and Party members for a few days, which have been very effective. The main content is to explain the spirit of Party rectification (purpose and guidelines), stabilize their emotions, improve their enthusiasm, and require them to change their style and serve the people well. It is clearly stated to them that the quality of actively leading production is one of the criteria for evaluating merits and demerits during future Party rectification. Secondly, explain the spirit of the Land Law Outline, and through village cadres and Party members, conduct publicity and explanation of the Land Law Outline to the masses to stabilize the production emotions of the masses. At the same time, pay attention to exposing rumors and preventing sabotage activities by bad elements.
　　Because in the past, there was no (basically no attention or importance was given to) extensive and in-depth publicity and explanation of the Land Law Outline based on the specific ideas of the masses and combined with daily work, the Land Law has been issued for three or four months, and now there are still many masses who simply do not know what the Land Law is. Some bad elements are spreading extremely absurd rumors of absolute equality, some saying: "Land is divided from Taihang Mountain eastward, or from Peiping to Nanjing, who knows who will be driven there?" Some say: "Even if the ashes shovel is too long, a section will have to be cut off." Therefore, the thinking of the masses in some places is very chaotic, resulting in a serious phenomenon of sitting idle and not actively producing. The poor peasants who have already turned over are worried about "disruptive equal distribution" and are afraid of not being able to keep what they have been allocated; some people have the incorrect idea of relying on struggle for food, not trying to produce themselves, but waiting for struggle; the most unstable are the middle peasants, especially in areas where the struggle against landlords and rich peasants is relatively thorough, the middle peasants have the most concerns and are afraid of struggle. In order to stabilize the emotions of the masses and speed up production, the editorial calls on comrades in various places to use all occasions and all possibilities to publicize and explain to the masses, so that every mass understands that whoever plants will reap is certain, and even the land of landlords and rich peasants is self-planted and self-reaped. As long as it is labor income, it will be guaranteed not to be touched during future land reform. The Border Government has already issued a proclamation on this point, and various places must resolutely implement it. And according to the past land reform situation, explain that future land reform in the vast majority of areas is not a problem of equal distribution, let alone "disruptive equal distribution," but basically a problem of appropriate supplementation at the village level, and the land change will not be very large.
　　Finally, the editorial also proposed that while solving the ideological obstacles of cadres and the masses, attention should be paid to solving the production difficulties of the masses, such as the lack of livestock and farm implements, the lack of basic grain for production for the masses in disaster areas, and the lack of capital for small handicraftsmen and some side occupations. The main way to solve these difficulties is not to rely on grain and loan (of course, grain and loan can solve some problems if they can be well and selectively lent to the masses who should be lent), but to rely on how to organize and give play to the power of the broad masses and promote the masses to solve it themselves. In areas where manpower and animal power are lacking, they can be organized, and the old, weak, orphaned, and strong can exchange labor, and people and animals can exchange labor under the principle of equal value exchange, but it must be the true voluntariness of the masses, and absolutely no coercion, commandism, or substitution is allowed. In order to solve the difficulties of the masses' livelihood and overcome the spring famine, attention must be paid to combining sideline production such as textile, transportation, leaching salt, and boiling nitrate with agricultural production, and attention must be paid to solving the difficulties of sideline production and the sales of sideline products. At the same time, attention should be paid to ensuring that the remaining fruits (especially land and grain funds) in various places are distributed in a timely manner to poor and hired peasants who have not turned over or have not turned over thoroughly, as well as to middle peasants who still have many difficulties in production, according to the principle of equal distribution. In areas that have undergone a major review last year, special attention should be paid to persuading the poor and hired, and the middle peasants who have been wrongly struggled and suffered losses must be compensated and the hats of the struggled households must be removed. Landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of the house must be given living and production materials, and their due share will be supplemented in future supplementation, because if these specific problems are not solved, the production enthusiasm of the masses will still be difficult to stabilize. In areas where secret societies and witches confuse the public, they should be exposed immediately in combination with the examples of the masses being deceived and educated the masses to concentrate on production; for the currently prevalent seasonal epidemics, medical teams should be set up or doctors in the countryside should be mobilized to actively carry out medical work. In cherishing the people's labor and animal power, random dispatches are not allowed to reduce the burden on the people. From now on, the masses can refuse to send dispatches casually without formal procedures. Any agency that forces the masses to send cars or laborers at will is not allowed, and violators will be subject to due punishment.

　　冀南日报社论号召
  　解决干群思想障碍  认真搞好春耕生产
    【冀南消息】冀南日报为解决目前干部和群众思想的紊乱与动荡，特于四月二十八日发出社论，号召各级干部打破思想障碍，在目前急需进行的春耕生产中积极工作，十分负责的组织领导生产，正确的执行政策以消除群众在生产中的顾虑，提高群众生产情绪，带领广大群众积极生产。社论分析今天干部及群众所存在的思想障碍问题说：自从整党以后，不少县区干部工作信心降低，竟日小心翼翼，谨小慎微，不敢负责。更有少数干部对党不满，消极怠工，对工作放任自流。由于我们对土地法大纲的精神宣传解释不够，造成群众情绪混乱，加以群众的一些具体困难未能很好解决，给某些破坏分子以扰乱社会破坏生产的机会。隆尧很多村破坏分子造出“活神仙”，广平四区油坊白阳古教准备骚动，前者县区干部不加过问，后者群众向区报告也置之不理，结果使群众蒙受了不应有的损失。除以上在一般县区干部中所存在的思想问题以外，在搞生产的县份，不少县区干部对生产的重要性认识不足，有的轻视生产，愿作土改，有的认为土改重要，生产次要，或认为第一等干部搞土改，第二等干部搞生产。更有些县份，一部分干部不愿领导生产，却孤零零的搞起土改基点村来。此外有一些干部对搞生产倒安心，也愿意搞生产，但不重视生产中具体的组织领导工作，认为群众自己会生产，到什么节气群众自然就进行什么生产，用不着多操心。
    在一般村干部党员的思想中，因为对整党精神不了解，大都消极怠工，等待整党过关，遇事不过问，见问题不解决，怕得罪群众将来给提意见，抱着多一事不如少一事的思想。好村干党员感到冤枉，情绪也不高；错误较小的愿意赶快整党，整过去就没心病了；少数错误较大较多的表现恐慌，企图掩饰自己的错误。社论指出：村干党员思想障碍的解决，是今天进行生产急待解决的重要环节。不然下边的无政府状态无法克服，各村生产无法推动。解决的办法，广宗等地办村干党员训练班，威县、清河等县召开几天的村干党员短期集训，都有很大成效。主要内容是讲解整党精神（目的与方针），安定其情绪，提高其积极性，要求他们改变作风，好好为人民服务。对他们明确表明积极领导生产的好坏，是将来整党时评定功过标准之一。其次讲解土地法大纲的精神，经过村干党员对群众进行土地法大纲的宣传解释，安定群众生产情绪，同时注意揭破谣言，防止坏分子的破坏活动。
    由于过去没有（基本上不注意不重视）广泛深入的根据群众具体思想结合日常工作反复的宣传解释土地法大纲，土地法已发下三四个月了，现在还有很多群众对土地法简直不知是啥。有些坏分子并多方散布极端荒谬的绝对平的流言，有的说：“分地从太行山往东分，或从北平向南京分，不知谁被赶到那里去？”有的说：“掏灰＠长了也得截去一节。”所以有些地方群众思想非常混乱，产生坐吃山空不积极生产的严重现象。已翻身的贫农耽心要“打乱平分”，对自己分得的东西，怕落不住；有一些人产生不正确的靠斗争吃饭的思想，自己不设法生产，只等待斗争；情绪最动荡的是中农，特别在斗争地主富农比较彻底的地区，中农顾虑最多，怕斗争。为安定群众情绪，加紧进行生产，社论号召各地工作同志利用一切场合、一切可能，向群众进行宣传解释，使每个群众都了解谁种谁收是肯定的，就是地主富农的土地也是自种自收，只要是劳动所得，将来土改时保证不动，这一点边府已出了布告，各地必须坚决执行。并且根据过去土改情况，说明将来土改在绝大多数地区不是平分问题，更不是“打乱平分”而是基本上以村为单位进行适当抽补的问题，土地变动不会很大。
    最后，社论并提出在解决干部及群众思想障碍的同时，应注意解决群众的生产困难，如缺乏牲畜农具，灾区群众没有生产垫底粮，小手工业者及某些副业缺乏资本等。这些困难的解决，主要的不是依靠贷粮贷款（当然贷粮贷款如能很好的有重点的贷到应贷的群众手里，也能解决一些问题），而是依靠如何组织与发挥广大群众的力量，推动群众起来自己解决。在人力畜力缺乏的地区，可以组织起来，老弱孤寡与青壮年可以换工，人畜在等价交换的原则下可以变工，但必须是群众的真正自愿，绝对不准强迫命令包办代替。为了解决群众生活困难，渡过春荒，必须注意把副业生产如纺织、运输、淋盐、熬硝与农业生产结合起来，并须注意解决副业生产的困难及副业产品的销路问题。同时，应注意保证把各地的果实余尾（特别是土地粮款”，依平分原则及时分配给未翻身或翻身不透的贫雇农民以及生产上尚有极多困难的中农手里。在去年曾经大复查的地区，应特别认真注意的说服贫雇，对错斗受损失的中农，必须予以补偿并摘下被斗户的帽子，对扫地出门的地主富农必须给以生活与生产的资料，在将来抽补中再补足他应得的一份，因为这些具体问题得不到解决，群众的生产情绪还是难以安定的。在会门巫神惑众的地区，应即结合群众受骗上当的实例予以揭破，教育群众安心生产；对现在流行的时疫，应即设法组织医疗队或动员在乡医生，积极进行医疗工作。在爱惜民力畜力上，不准乱支差，减轻人民的负担，今后不经正式手续随便派差者，群众可加以拒绝，任何机关强制群众随便派车要夫都是不允许的，违者要受到应有的制裁。
