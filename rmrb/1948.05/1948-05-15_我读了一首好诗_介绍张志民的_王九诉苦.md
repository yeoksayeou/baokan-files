I really like the long poem "Wang Jiu's Grievances." I don't know where Comrade Zhang Zhimin, the author, is from or where he works. I remember reading other works of his, but this piece, "Wang Jiu's Grievances," moved me greatly. The opening two lines of the "Landlord Sun" section:

"Entering the village, no need to ask, every stone, big and small, bears the name Sun." are written with great force. The following ten lines:

"Landlord Sun covers the sky with one hand,
The poor man dies with nowhere to be buried.
Landlord Sun's tile house has courtyard after courtyard,
The poor man runs naked along the eaves.
Landlord Sun's aged rice breeds worms,
The poor man's watery porridge reflects his face.
Landlord Sun stamps his foot in the street,
Scaring the poor man out of his wits.
Landlord Sun rattles his abacus,
Calculating away family after family."

Simply, plainly, and powerfully, they describe Landlord Sun's entire "identity," his "life story," instantly arousing a sense of disgust. The second paragraph, "Wang Jiu's Account," is a concrete expression of Landlord Sun's crimes—the first paragraph being a kind of "overview"—and is also very realistic, specific, and vividly powerful. The technique and form of the entire long poem are also very good, both popular and easy to recite, and also extremely moving. "In August, the autumn wind is cool, sorghum and millet fill the fields," "I hold up that bottomless measuring cup with both hands, tears rolling down into it, measuring stone after stone, is there a single grain of rice that isn't blood and sweat?" "Wang Jiu's heart feels like it's being cut with a dull knife, the bowl is snatched away from my mouth even as the food reaches my lips." "When people are poor, their ambition fades. I, Wang Jiu, am worse off than Landlord Sun's pig!" "Drawing water at four in the morning before dawn, Landlord Sun curses a few times from his bed," "Landlord Sun is always taking advantage of you," "The northwest wind blows hard, freezing every drop of water," "The window frame is broken by the wind, snow pushes open the door, freezing people to death in the middle of the night," "The children are frozen like featherless birds"... and the final accusation section "... cloudy days will turn sunny." "The big poplar leaves rustle, a big meeting under the poplar trees,"... "Wang Jiu's heart feels like a pot is boiling, decades of bitterness flow into a river"... are all very good sentences. In short, I have recently read many poems about land reform and the struggles of peasants to speak out and turn themselves over, and very few are written this well. I want to introduce this long poem to all readers, all poetry lovers, and creators. I want to shake the hand of the author, poet Zhang Zhimin, tightly and forcefully, and congratulate him on his success! I hope he will write more such fighting poems.

### 我读了一首好诗  介绍张志民的“王九诉苦”

    我读了一首好诗
    介绍张志民的“王九诉苦”
    我很喜欢“王九诉苦”那首长诗。作者张志民同志，不知是那里人，在何处工作。我记得还读过他的其他作品，但这篇“王九诉苦”给我的震动颇大。“孙老财”那一段开头两句：
    “进了村子不用问，大小石头都姓孙”。就写得非常有劲。下面十句：
     “孙老财一手把天地盖，
     穷小子死了没处埋。
     孙老财瓦房前院连后院，
     穷小子光着屁股串房檐。
     孙老财的陈米生了虫，
     穷小子菜粥锅里照人影。
     孙老财街里一跺脚，
     吓得穷小子不知怎么好。
     孙老财算盘排扒打，
     算光了一家又一家。”
    简单，朴素，生动有力地描写出孙老财的整个“身份”，“生平”，使人顿起一种憎恶之感。下面第二段“王九的帐”，算是孙老财罪恶的具体表现。——第一段算是“概论”——也算非常真实、具体，同时形象突出，很有力量。整篇长诗的手法，形式也非常好，既通俗、顺口，也极能感动人。“八月里来秋风凉，高粱谷子齐上场”，“我双手捧起那没梁儿的斗，眼泪滚滚顺斗流，量了一石又一石，那一粒谷子不是血和汗？”“我王九心象钝刀儿割，饭到嘴边把碗夺。”“人穷志短没奈何，我王九不如老财的猪！”“四更打水天不明，老财被窝里骂几声”，“孙老财对你一百一”，“西北风紧吹滴水成冰”，“窗棂儿刮断雪推门，深更半夜冻死人”，“孩子冻的象光翅鸟”……以及最后控诉一段“……阴天也会变晴天”。“大杨叶儿哗哗响，杨树底下大会场，”……“王九的心里象开了锅，几十年的苦水流成河”……都是非常好的句子。总之，我最近读到许多关于土地改革、农民斗争诉苦翻身的诗歌，很少有这样写得好的。我要向所有的读者、所有的诗歌爱好者、创作者介绍这首长诗。我要向作者张志民诗人紧紧地用力地握手，庆祝他的成功！希望他再多写些这样战斗的诗歌出来。
