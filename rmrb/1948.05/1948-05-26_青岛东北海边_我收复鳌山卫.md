　　I Recaptured Aoshanwei
    【Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd】 Late news: Aoshanwei, a strategically important coastal area northeast of Qingdao, was once again recovered by our Jiaodong South Sea Military Sub-district's armed forces on April 26th. It is reported that this area was briefly recovered by us on March 20th, and the defending enemy fled in disarray. The next day, we continued to liberate 46 villages and towns including Dinglu Town, and routed two companies of the Qingdao Security Regiment, annihilating a portion of the enemy. Currently, we control 30 kilometers of the coastline in this area. Another unit of local armed forces captured the outposts of Fenghuang Mountain and Ma Mountain (15 li southeast of Yantai City) on the periphery of Yantai on April 28th, completely annihilating a company of the enemy's 8th Army defending Fenghuang Mountain, and seizing seven light and heavy machine guns, two 60mm mortars, and forty submachine guns, rifles, etc.
