This is the result of your correct implementation of Chairman Mao's strategic policies and military principles.

The entire border region is jubilant and inspired. You are an invincible people's ever-victorious army. The achievements of each of you are as glorious as the democratic holy land - Yan'an. On behalf of the people of the entire border region, we salute you, and will take active actions to restore the construction of the border region, strive to develop production, and fully support the front line. In order to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandit troops, liberate the Great Northwest, we are determined to be your most loyal and reliable backing. Victory after victory, march to Xi'an, capture Hu Zongnan alive, liberate the Great Northwest, and liberate all of China. With victorious salutations!
