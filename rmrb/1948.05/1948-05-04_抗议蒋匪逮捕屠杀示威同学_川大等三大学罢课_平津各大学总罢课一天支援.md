Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. According to Tianjin newspapers: Sichuan University, West China University, and Chenghua University in Chengdu have been holding anti-oppression strikes since April 10 to protest the "April 9th Massacre." It is reported that on April 9th, more than 1,000 students from the three universities marched to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit provincial government to request the allocation of low-priced rice. More than 130 students were arrested by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and many were beaten. Luo Wanzhang, Li Weipin, and You Xuntian (female) from Sichuan University were seriously injured. You Xuntian subsequently died from her injuries. More than 40 of the arrested students have not been released. After the massacre, the three universities separately organized support associations for the April 9th Massacre and began strikes, demanding the immediate release of those arrested and the severe punishment of the murderers. Students from the three schools also went to various middle schools to report on the details of the bloody incident and appealed for assistance. All students at Sichuan University also went on a hunger strike on the 13th, demanding the release of the arrested students. However, the murderer, Wang Lingji, Chairman of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Sichuan Provincial Government, not only did not accept the students' demands but also threatened to "thoroughly rectify the academic atmosphere in Sichuan."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. According to Tianjin newspapers: Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University in Beiping, Nankai University, Peiyang University in Tianjin, and Tangshan Institute of Technology, a total of eleven institutions (note: previously foreign news agencies mistakenly reported ten institutions), in order to support the anti-oppression student movement of the three universities in Chengdu, in addition to holding a one-day general strike on April 21, also jointly launched a "fasting and fundraising for the students of the April 9th Massacre in Chengdu." The Sichuan Fellow Provincial Association in Beiping published an open letter to Wang Lingji and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Sichuan Provincial Assembly on the 20th, severely protesting the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' creation of the April 9th Massacre and accusing the Chiang Kai-shek gang of their crimes to the elders and folks of Sichuan. Sichuan students from various universities in Beiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan are about to establish a "United Association of Sichuan Students" to unite and resist the persecution of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

  　平津各大学总罢课一天支援
    【新华社陕北一日电】据津报消息：成都四川、华西、成华三大学已于四月十日起举行反压迫罢课，抗议“四、九惨案”。按三大学学生千余人于四月九日向蒋匪省府要求配发平价米游行请愿时，当有一百三十余学生遭蒋匪逮捕，被欧伤者甚多，川大罗宛章、李维品、游训天（女）三人负重伤，游训天随因伤重毙命，被捕学生中仍有四十余人未获释放。三大学于惨案发生后，即分别组织四九惨案后援会，并开始罢课，要求立即释放被捕者，严惩凶手；三校学生并分赴各中学报告血案经过，呼吁援助。川大全校学生且于十三日绝食，要求释放被捕学生。但杀人凶手蒋匪四川省府主席王陵基不但未接受学生要求，且扬言“将对全川学风大加整饬。”
    【新华社陕北一日电】据津报消息：北平北大、清华、燕京等，天津南开、北洋等与唐山工学院共十一院校（按：前据外国通讯社误为十院校），为援助成都三大学反压迫学潮，除于四月二十一日举行总罢课一天外，并曾联合发动“为成都四、九惨案学生节食募捐”。四川旅平同学会则于二十日发表致王匪陵基及蒋匪川省参议会公开信，严重抗议蒋匪制造四、九血案，并向全川父老控诉蒋匪帮罪恶。平津唐各院校川籍学生即将成立“四川同学联合会”，团结抵抗蒋匪迫害。
