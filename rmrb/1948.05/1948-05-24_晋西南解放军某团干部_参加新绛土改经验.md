Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 16th. The Xinjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jin-Southwest recently reported to the leaders of the Jin-Sui Military Region that the participation of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army in land reform in the county has greatly helped to improve the ideology of cadres and transform the troops. The report stated: When the land reform in Xinjiang began last December, Ji Wenguang, political commissar of a certain regiment, and 15 cadres of the regiment left their original work to participate in the land reform in Xinjiang, working independently in one district. Ji Wenguang directly served as the chairman of a district farmers' association, and a comrade with experience in local work served as the vice chairman of the district farmers' association. In the past three and a half months, they have completed the land reform task in the district, and it is the best district among the five districts in the county. The experience from this work shows that the participation of the troops in land reform has a significant effect on the transformation of the troops and the resolution of the relationship between the military and the people, the military and the government, and the relationship with the Party. First, the main reason why the troops violated mass discipline in the past was that the cadres of the troops did not understand the hardships of the masses' lives enough. This time, the cadres of the troops themselves became chairmen and committee members, and they were in charge of Party, government, military, and civilian work in a district. In a village, they were in the position of a village head, a secretary of a branch, or a chairman of a farmers' association, and they specifically understood the difficulties of the masses and the danger of the troops being separated from the masses due to poor discipline. Therefore, in the past few months, when other troops came to demand supplies, flour, and housing, they made many demands on the masses, and there were many violations of discipline. They were able to resolutely oppose this error, thinking of the interests of the masses in everything. From the county committee's point of view, they even seemed to have a reversed deviation, that is, they took less care of the troops and emphasized the difficulties of the masses more. Second, because the army cadres led the land reform, the masses actually saw that the People's Liberation Army was truly their own team, truly for the interests of the people, not only fighting to protect the masses, but also overthrowing the landlord class and leading the poor to turn over. This practical action is better than thousands of verbal propaganda. Third, the relationship between the military and the government and the military and the people has undergone fundamental changes. In the past, some cadres of the regiment looked down on Party and government cadres, thinking that they were enjoying themselves in the rear. This time, they became district heads and village heads and realized that local cadres were working hard, serving the masses day and night, and truly realized that Party and government work is very complicated. If it is not done well, the battle will not be fought well, and the army will encounter many difficulties. Fourth, they have a deeper understanding that land reform is the foundation of all work, and it is clear that the army is serving the people. In particular, seeing that in villages where the work has been done well, the masses' participation in the army, the war, the payment of public grain, and the reception of the army are all good. If the work is not done well and the masses do not turn over, there is no way to do anything. Fifth, they have developed a mass style, a democratic spirit, and gradually become more detailed in seeing problems.

　　晋西南解放军某团干部
  　参加新绛土改经验
    【新华社晋绥十六日电】晋西南新绛中共县委，顷门晋绥军区首长报告解放军某团在该县参加土改，对提高干部思想改造部队有极大作用。报告中称：去年十二月新绛土改开始时，某团政委冀文广和该团十五个干部即脱离原来工作参加新绛土改，单独作一个区的工作，冀文广直接任一个区农会主席，另由一个地方工作有经验的同志任区农会副主席。三个半月来已完成了该区土改任务，并为全县五个区中工作最好的一区。从此次工作经验中说明部队参加土改对部队的改造，解决军民、军政，以及和党的关系上都有重大的作用。第一，过去部队违犯群众纪律，主要原因是部队干部对群众的生活困苦理解不够。此次该部队干部自己当了主席、委员，在一个区就是党政军民工作的负责人，在一个村就是一个村长、支书或农会主席的地位，具体了解了群众的困难和部队纪律不好而脱离群众的危险。因此在几个月中别的部队来了要差、要面、住房子，对群众要求很多，而且有许多违犯纪律，他们都能一切为群众利益着想坚决反对这种错误。从县委看来，甚至他们似乎发生了相反的偏差，即照顾部队差一些强调群众困难多了一些。第二，由于军队干部领导土改，使群众实际看到人民解放军真正是自己的队伍，真正是为了人民利益，不仅打仗保护群众，而且打倒地主阶级领导穷人翻身。这种实际的行动胜过千百次的口头宣传。第三，军政、军民关系有根本改变，该团干部过去有些看不起党政干部，认为他们在后方享福，这次他们当了区长、村长才了解到地方干部是辛苦的，白日黑夜时时刻刻为群众办事，真正了解到党政工作很复杂，如果做不好，仗就打不好，军队就会碰到很多困难。第四，对土改是一切工作的基础，了解比较深刻了，军队是为人民服务一点明确了，特别是看到工作搞好了的村子，群众的参军、参战、交公粮、招待军队都好，工作没搞好，群众没翻身则一切都没有办法。第五，养成了群众作风、民主精神，看问题慢慢细致化了。
