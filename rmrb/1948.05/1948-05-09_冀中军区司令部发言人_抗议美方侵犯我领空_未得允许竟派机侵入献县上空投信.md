Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 7th. The spokesperson for the Jizhong Military Region Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a statement on the 4th regarding the request by Mr. Colebrook, the U.S. Consul General in Beiping, to the relevant authorities in Xian County to assist the twelve foreign nuns of the Precious Blood Society of the Catholic Church in the county to leave the country and return home. The statement said: The consistent policy of the democratic government in the Liberated Areas is to protect the people's freedom of religious belief. All foreign nationals residing in the Liberated Areas, as long as they abide by the policies and laws of the democratic government, do not participate in U.S. imperialist aid to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, and do not engage in conspiracies to sabotage the Liberated Areas, the democratic government will protect all their activities—including the freedom to preach. Our Jizhong public security organs recently uncovered a large-scale international espionage case in the Catholic Church in Xian County and are handling it according to law. However, the aforementioned twelve foreign nuns of the Precious Blood Society of the church have been found to have no connection with this case, and our democratic government has already given legal protection to all their activities. Now that Mr. Colebrook, the U.S. Consul General in Beiping, has requested assistance in their departure and return home, we have forwarded Mr. Colebrook's letter to the nuns, and their decision to stay or leave is entirely up to them. However, this time, the U.S. Consulate General in Beiping did not notify our Liberated Area democratic government in advance, nor did it obtain permission, and actually sent an aircraft with unidentified markings to enter the airspace of our Liberated Area to deliver letters. This is an illegal act of infringing upon the sovereignty of the airspace of our Liberated Area. Especially in this military period, this kind of behavior is most likely to cause adverse consequences. We hereby lodge a protest and call on the U.S. authorities in China to pay serious attention. In the future, if the U.S. side has any matters that need to be handled with our side, they should first send personnel on the ground to contact us and must not use this method of delivering documents without our consent.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 7th. At about 10:00 AM on the 3rd, an aircraft with unidentified markings intruded into the Jizhong Liberated Area and dropped three letters over the Catholic Church in Xian County. One was written by Mr. Colebrook, the U.S. Consul General in Beiping, to the Xian County government, stating that the Canadian Precious Blood General Society was ordered to notify the Precious Blood branch of the Catholic Church three Chinese miles northeast of Xian County, that five Canadian nuns, five American nuns, and two British nuns, a total of twelve people, were returning home, and hoped that the relevant authorities in Xian County would assist them in safely leaving the country and facilitate their return. If agreed, they would reply via the Shanbei Xinhua Broadcasting Station. They were very grateful. Another letter was a certificate from Zhao Zhensheng, the bishop of the Xian County Diocese of the Catholic Church, proving that the request from the President of the Canadian Saint-Hai Xin Society to send the nuns back home was true. In addition, there was a letter from Colebrook to the Catholic Church in Xian County. After the local people found the above three letters, they immediately sent them to the Xian County government. The letter from Colebrook to the Catholic Church in Xian County has been forwarded to the person in charge of the church by the democratic government.

　　冀中军区司令部发言人
  　抗议美方侵犯我领空
    未得允许竟派机侵入献县上空投信
    【新华社晋察冀七日电】中国人民解放军冀中军区司令部发言人，为美国驻北平总领事柯乐博要求献县有关当局，协助该县天主堂宝血会的十二位外籍修女离境回国一事，于四日发表谈话称：解放区民主政府的一贯政策，是保障人民的宗教信仰自由，凡侨居解放区的一切外籍人士，只要遵守民主政府的政策法令，不参与美帝国主义援蒋内战及不从事破坏解放区的阴谋活动者，民主政府当保护其一切行动——包括传教自由。我冀中公安机关，近在献县天主堂内破获一大规模国际间谍案，正依法处理中，惟前述该堂宝血会十二位外籍修女，因已查明与此案并无关系，其一切行动，我民主政府业已依法予以保护。今美国驻北平总领事柯乐博氏要求协助他们离境返国，我方已将柯氏书信转交诸修女，去留与否，悉由彼等自行决定。惟此次美国驻北平总领事馆事先未通知我解放区民主政府，并取得许可，竟由不明标识之飞机进入我解放区上空投递书信，实属侵犯我解放区领空主权之非法行为，尤以值此军事时期，此种行为最易引起不良后果。兹特提出抗议，唤起美国驻华当局严重注意，今后美方如有事件需要我方交涉，应先经地面派遣人员，与我方取得联系，不得未经我方同意再行采用此项方法投递书文。
    【新华社晋察冀七日电】三日上午十时左右，有不明标识之飞机一架，侵入冀中解放区，在献县天主教堂附近上空，投下书信三封，其一系美国驻北平总领事柯乐博写给献县县政府者，信内略谓：加拿大宝血总会奉命通知献县东北三华里天主教堂宝血分会，五位加拿大修女，五位美国修女，及两位英国修女，共十二人回国，希望献县有关当局，协助他们安全离境，给予回国方便，如得同意，即由陕北新华广播电台答复他们。他们很感谢。另一是天主教献县教区主教赵振声证明加拿大圣海新会总会长请求把修女们送回国去，是真实的。此外，一封是柯乐博写给献县天主堂的。上述三封信，当地人民检获后即送交献县县政府，其中柯乐博写给献县天主堂的一封信，已由民主政府转交该堂负责人。
