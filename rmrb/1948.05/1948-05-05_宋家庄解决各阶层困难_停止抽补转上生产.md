After solving these difficulties, the masses had a high enthusiasm for production and made great achievements in just half a month. In terms of sideline occupations: the village sent 22 animals to Jingxing to sell coal and transported grain for the public-owned store exchange, earning 330,000 yuan in foreign currency three times. Thirty people earned 270,000 yuan in foreign currency three times. Five animals were engaged in transportation in the mountains (Xiyang, Zhanshang, Pingding, Songta), earning 75,000 yuan in foreign currency. Thirty-five people carried and sold copper, earning 425,000 yuan in foreign currency. There were also grinding flour and selling vinegar, etc. The total income from the above-mentioned production was 1,862,000 yuan in foreign currency. In terms of agriculture: in addition to extracting the above-mentioned male labor and animal power to engage in sideline occupations, all male and female semi-labor force in the village were organized to participate in agriculture. In addition to sending all the manure to the fields, they also watered the wheat planted in the gardens, planted two-thirds of the melons, and planted more than 400 mu of sorghum, which is now continuing to be planted.
