Excessive Wages Harm Both Labor and Capital
　　Tongfenghou and Other Stores Care for Capitalists, Leading to Great Business Development
    [Changzhi News] Jixing Sauce Garden in Xinnan Street, Second District of Changzhi City, has 680,000 yuan in capital and eight laborers. The laborers do not have fixed wages but receive half of the profits as dividends. In addition, there is also a 28% profit sharing and bonus system. Calculated from a net profit of 780,000 yuan in 70 days, after deducting wages, dividends, and bonuses, the capitalist only receives 4,500 yuan for every 10,000 yuan, while a laborer can earn up to 82,000 yuan, equivalent to the dividend from 180,000 yuan in capital. The shareholders reflected, "Making money is making money, but the shareholders don't get it." Therefore, capital cannot be expanded, and the workers are also dissatisfied. Wang Wu, a sauce-making worker, said, "We can only make dark soy sauce. We want to make sweet soy sauce, sesame sauce, and green soy sauce, but we don't have the capital. When peddlers come to buy, they can't get all the goods, and many customers are turned away, delaying a lot of business." Tongfenghou store in Xinnan Street pays each laborer five dou of rice per month, plus a 28% profit sharing, totaling 14.8 shi of millet per year. 10,000 yuan of capital can earn 59,000 yuan in dividends per year. The wages earned by the labor force can support three people (each person needs 3 dou of millet per month, and 6 zhang of cloth per year). The enthusiasm for production is very high; the more active, the more money earned, and the more capital can be expanded. People in Xinnan Street all want to invest in this store. Xinshengyuan Workshop (mixed business) in Xinnan Street, calculated over three and a half months, capitalists receive 14,000 yuan in dividends for every 10,000 yuan of capital; milling workers earn 48,000 yuan in three months, equivalent to the dividend from 34,000 yuan in capital; general workers earn 36,000 yuan in three months, equivalent to the dividend from 25,000 yuan in capital; cadres earn half the wages of general laborers, earning 18,000 yuan in three months, equivalent to the dividend from 13,000 yuan in capital (the above is just wages; dividends are not included). Because the interests of both labor and capital are appropriately taken care of, there is no worry about expanding capital. When it opened last September, it only had 240,000 yuan in capital, but by the end of January of this year, it had expanded to 2,120,000 yuan, reaching nine times the original capital.

    (Editor's Note: From the submitted稿, Jixing Sauce Garden's inappropriate profit sharing and excessively high wages have affected business development; Tongfenghou and other stores have appropriate wages that take care of both labor and capital, leading to great business development. But are such wage and dividend systems fully conducive to business development? Further inspection and research are still needed.)

　　工资过高劳资都吃亏
  　同丰厚等店照顾资方营业大发展
    【长治消息】长市二区新南街吉星酱园，有六十八万元资金，八个劳力。劳力没有固定工资，系从利润中抽出二分之一红利作为工资。另外还有二八分红与奖励金，从七十天七十八万纯利中计算，除扣除工资分红与奖金外，资方一万元只分四千五，而一个劳力最高则可赚到八万二千多元，相当于十八万元的资金分红。股东们反映：“赚钱倒赚钱，就是赚不到股东手。”故资本一直不能扩大，工人们也不满意。做酱工人王五则说：“咱只能做些黑酱，想做些甜酱、芝麻酱、青酱，没有本钱，小贩们来买不全货，把好多顾客都顶走了，耽搁了好多买卖。”下南街同丰厚商店，一个劳力工资一月五斗米，加上二八分红，一年合小米十四石八。一万元资金一年可分五万九千元。劳方赚的工资可养活三个人（每口人每月以小米三斗计、穿布一年以六丈计）。生产情绪很高，越积极越能赚钱，越能扩大资金。下南街群众谁也想往该号入股。新南街新盛源作坊（混合业务），三个半月计算，资方一万元可分红利一万四，磨面工人三个月赚洋四万八，等于三万四千元资金分红；一般工人三个月赚洋三万六，等于二万五千多元资金分红；干部赚一般劳力的一半工资，三个月赚洋一万八，等于一万三千元资金分红（以上只是工资，分红不在内）。由于适当的照顾了劳资双方利益，所以在扩大资金上也不发愁。去年九月开张时仅有资金二十四万元，到今年一月底就扩大到二百一十二万元，达到原资九倍。

    （编者按：从来稿看，吉星酱园由于分红不适当，工资过高影响营业发展；同丰厚等号工资适当照顾劳资双方，营业大发展。但这样的工资和分红制度，是否已经充分有利于营业的发展了？还应再作检查研究。）
