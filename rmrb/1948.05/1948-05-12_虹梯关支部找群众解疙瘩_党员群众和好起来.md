[Ping Shun News] After the democratic rectification movement in the Hongti Pass branch of the Sixth District of Ping Shun, two problems remained unresolved: First, people who had offered opinions to party members during the rectification were embarrassed to approach the party members again; second, the party members were willing to work, but the old methods could not be used, and new methods were lacking. Regarding the first problem, the branch held a special meeting to discuss it, deciding that everyone should disperse into various groups to continue earnestly examining themselves and asking for everyone's help. Party members Cheng Luzhu and Yue Fucheng went to the groups, in addition to supplementing their self-criticisms, expressing that "the millstone must be turned frequently, and accounts must be settled frequently," asking everyone to raise criticisms at any time and not allow them to accumulate into conflicts. Their attitude was very sincere and humble, and the masses were satisfied. As for individual masses who had conflicts with party members, they took the initiative to talk to them and resolve the conflicts. For example, female party member Liang Zongmei, whenever she saw the woman ××× who had given her opinions, spoke to her sincerely and earnestly, but the woman was always unnatural. Later, she found her at home to talk and asked for more help, only to discover that this woman was actually ashamed. She said, "The opinion I gave you was not accurate. I didn't want to give it, but ××× provoked me to say it. I have no face to see you!" In this way, they reconciled again. Other party members also resolved conflicts with the masses, and everyone felt that this solution was the best. Previously, when the masses talked on the street, they would stop when they saw party members, and the party members knew nothing. Now, everywhere they go, there is laughter and conversation, and people speak their minds very frankly, with no suspicion of each other. Regarding the problem that old work styles could not be used and new methods were lacking, a branch meeting was specially convened with the participation of farmer representatives. After discussion, the party members found that their past mistake was talking without doing, telling others to do the work while they themselves were lazy. Some said that they would "only do and not speak" in the future. Others disagreed, believing that not speaking was also wrong. After some debate, the final consensus was that both hands and mouths should move. Party member Guo Wusuo and others took the initiative to carry heavy loads when delivering manure, which motivated the masses. The masses said, "Heavy burdens cannot be carried by one person; we must maintain fairness and reasonableness, and no one should seek advantage or suffer a loss." In this way, everyone finally affirmed the new leadership method, which is that party members should speak and act first in their work, set an example, and lead the masses. They should discuss matters with the masses and not coerce or order the masses. All twenty-five party members in the village are willing to do this and strive to be models of the new work style.

    虹梯关支部找群众解疙瘩
    党员群众和好起来
    【平顺消息】平顺六区虹梯关支部在民主整党运动后，有两个问题没解决：一是整党时给党员提过意见的人总是不好意思再与党员接近；一是党员们愿意干工作，就是旧办法不能用，新办法又没有。关于第一个问题，支部专门开会讨论，决定大家分散到各组里去，继续着重的检讨自己，要求大家帮助自己。党员程芦柱、岳福成等到组，除补充检讨外，并表示“磨要勤转，帐要勤算”，要求大家有意见随时提出批评，不要积累起来成了疙瘩。态度很诚恳虚心，群众都满意。估计个别群众对自己结了疙瘩的党员，则主动去找人家谈心、解疙瘩。如女党员梁宗梅，一见到给自己提过意见的妇女×××，就诚心诚意和她说话，可是她总不自然。以后找到她家去谈心，要求多帮助自己，才发现这妇女是自己在惭愧。她说：“我给你提的那个意见不确实，我本来不想提，人家×××挑拨叫提哩。我没脸见你啦！”这样，以后她俩就又和好起来。别的党员也各自与群众解了疙瘩，大家都觉得这样解决是再好没有了，以前群众在街上说话，一见党员就不说了，党员啥也不得知道；现在到一处是有说有笑，有意见就说，非常直率，互相都没戒心了。关于旧作风用不上，新做法又没有的问题，专门召集了个有农民代表参加的支部会。经过讨论，党员们发现自己过去的错误是光说不实干，叫别人实干，自己偷懒。有的表示自己以后“光干不说了。”有的不同意，认为不说也不对。争执一顿，最后一致意见是手要动，嘴也要动。党员郭五锁等在送粪时自己先担重的，推动了群众。群众说：“重担不能一人担，要掌握住公平合理，都不能讨便宜，也不让吃亏。”这样，大家最后肯定了新的领导方法，就是有工作党员要先说先做，起模范，带领起群众。有事和群众商量，不是强迫命令群众。全村二十五个党员，都愿意这样做，争取当个新作风的模范。（虹梯关工作队）
