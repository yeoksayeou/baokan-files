　　【Ji Lu Yu News】The Lu Wen Jingdian market exchange had an official-style, official-shop way of doing things. This manifested itself in: First, the calico and grain businesses were centrally traded, making it inconvenient for the public to buy and sell. Transactions were crowded, and it could take a whole day to complete a grain transaction. After buyers and sellers agreed on a price, the transaction staff simply passed the money through their hands and deducted a commission. Sometimes they didn’t even give the money to the sellers to check. Trade in homespun cloth was even more crowded. Sometimes people from two or three market days would try to sell cloth, and some had their cloth strips (receipts for cloth sold, allowing them to get grain or other goods) squeezed out of their hands. One woman even had a miscarriage due to the crowding. Second, transactions were unfair and rife with corruption. The Jingdian public store sold grain at inflated prices when grain prices soared. Grain transaction staff member Wu Tianjiu privately bought two shi (approximately 200 liters) to hoard, while restricting the public to buying only one dou (approximately 10 liters). Third, there was a simple focus on earning commissions. After the grain was brought to market, staff simply waited to pass it through their hands, record it, and deduct commissions, without caring whether the public and merchants could sell their grain. Some people couldn’t sell their grain even after waiting a whole day and had to carry it back home. A farmer from Xue Village said he had to go to three market days to sell a cloth. He said, “Selling a cloth is harder than weaving one!” The public said that the transaction staff were just “pass-through staff,” not performing the role of transaction staff and not taking responsibility for facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce, based on these phenomena of being divorced from the masses, proposed reforms to the exchange, requiring education for transaction staff, settling accounts and transforming the bad work style of official-style, official-shop operations, and correcting the idea of not serving the masses. Transaction staff must adopt various trading methods to take the public's interests into account. Calico and grain businesses were changed to a shop-style operation, establishing retail outlets, and ensuring storage for the public and merchants if they couldn’t sell everything on a market day. Now, calico businesses have been divided from one location into five, and grain businesses from one location into six, with transactions also taking place on non-market days. Payment is made on the spot for buying and selling cloth, and scales for flower and grain must be fair. Transaction staff must be responsible for public transactions. Since the various businesses were decentralized, the public selling cloth said, “It’s not so crowded now that it’s divided up. Even if we wait outside without pushing in, we can get our turn before noon. Before, we had to wait until dark to sell our cloth, which wasted so much time!” The grain businesses also reflected, “It’s more convenient now. People can buy and sell wherever they want with their money.”

　　井店集改造交易所
  　群众买卖方便
    【冀鲁豫消息】闾文井店交易所有官坊官店作风。表现在：第一、花布粮行集中交易，群众买卖不方便，交易拥挤，买卖粮食等一天不能成交，买卖双方搞好价，交易员光过手扣佣钱，有时连款也不给点验，土布交易更拥挤，有的两三个集挤的卖不了布，有的把布条挤掉（卖布后拿着条到另处领花、粮等）。曾有一个妇女被挤的小产了。第二、交易不公平，营私舞弊。井店公营商店在粮食暴涨时作价出售，粮食交易员吴天久曾私自买了两石屯积起来，而限制群众只买一斗。第三、单纯吃佣钱观点，粮食上市后，只是等着过手记帐抽佣，群众及商贩的粮食是否能卖，不管不问，有的等一天也卖不了还得背回去。薛村一个农民赶了三个集才卖去个布，他说：“卖一个布比织一个布还难哩。”群众说交易员是“过手员”，不起交易员的作用，对双方成交不负责。工商局根据这些脱离群众的现象，对交易所提出改造，要对交易员进行教育，清算和转变官坊官店坏作风，纠正不为群众服务思想。交易员必须采用各种交易方式为群众打算，花布粮行改为行店式的，建立门市，一集卖不完管给群众和商贩保存。现在花布行市由一处分成五处，粮行由一处分成六处，逢背集也成交，买卖布当面交款、花斗称必须公平，对群众交易必须负责。自从各行分散成交后，卖布群众说：“这一分开没那样挤了，就是在外边等着不往里边挤，到不了上午也轮着咱啦。象以前那样一直等到天黑还卖不了布哩，这样少耽误好多工夫！”粮行也反映说：“这随便啦，拿着钱愿意在哪里买卖就可以在哪里买卖。”
