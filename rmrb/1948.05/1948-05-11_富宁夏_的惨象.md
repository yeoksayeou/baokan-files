The Tragic State of “Rich Ningxia”

The saying "With the Yellow River, Ningxia prospers," has now become a living hell.

Ma Hongkui's sixteen years of murderous rule in Ningxia Province is a "model" within the KMT-controlled areas. Here, people, regardless of age or gender, whether at home or out, must carry "identification cards." The birth of a baby, the death of an elder, or the visit of relatives must be reported; a moment's delay is a crime, punishable by imprisonment for serious offenses or a beating for minor ones. One person's crime brings trouble to the entire family. Villages and towns have been reduced to a state of near emptiness, with the able-bodied seized for conscription, the elderly forced to repair roads, and women and children toiling in factories. The exorbitant taxes here are countless: "National Defense Grain," "Land Grain," "Baojia Grain," etc. All the grain that the people work hard to harvest throughout the year goes into the Ma family's warehouses, causing famine for the farmers year after year. Every spring, Ma Hongkui forces the distribution of rotten grain from the bottom of his warehouses to the people, falsely calling it "relief grain" or "seed grain," amounting to less than five sheng per dou. By autumn, he demands three additional sheng per dou upon repayment, which must be winnowed. Other taxes and levies, such as business tax, camel tax, livestock tax, entertainment tax, banquet tax, house tax, shipping tax, slaughter tax, and road maintenance fees, are too numerous to list. The exploitation of sheep-raising households is even more severe. In addition to the regular sheep tax, they must hand over twenty to thirty hides for every hundred sheep. In the Yanchi area and Tongxin County, occupied by the Ma bandits, there are a total of 238,000 sheep, resulting in an annual sheep tax of 297.5 million yuan, plus over 70,000 hides. Butchers must pay a tax of 10,000 yuan for each sheep, and another 4,000 yuan slaughter tax after butchering, while the government only pays 500 yuan for each sheepskin (private sales are prohibited). Last year, when Ma Hongkui prepared to attack the border region, he extorted more than a thousand horses, camels, mules, and donkeys from the people.

Ma Hongkui established a Juemin (Awakening the People) Society in Ningxia City, forcibly recruiting children to learn opera to make money. Tickets cost between 4,000 and 8,000 yuan; if they couldn't be sold, they were distributed to the Baojia heads, forcing people to buy them, whether they watched the opera or not. The "Aviation Patriotic Lottery" was also forcibly promoted to the people in the same way.

According to statistics, Ma Hongkui occupied a quarter of the houses in Ningxia City. His method of occupation was to use the pretext of improving the city's appearance to order citizens to demolish old houses within a time limit and rebuild them according to regulations. When citizens were unable to do so, Ma Hongkui's engineering office would demolish and rebuild them. After completion, citizens were required to pay all expenses within a time limit. If they could not pay, the engineering office would lease the house back to the original owner, using the land as collateral. If the rent was not paid on time, the house would become Ma Hongkui's property.

The Ma bandits occupied the people's fields and houses and built mansions everywhere. In the eastern garden of Ningxia city is a memorial hall to Yunting (Ma Hongkui's father), and in Xinyi Street there are assembly halls and mansions numbered one, two, three, four, and five. In Beichaishi there are mansions belonging to Ma Jiahua and Ma Jiaju (Ma Hongkui's grandsons), in Luxi Lane there is a mansion belonging to Ma Dunhou, and in Fuxing Street there is a mansion belonging to Ma Dunjing. In Ximaying there are Huaiyuan Tower and Gongxue Tower, and in Nanguan there is Ningjing Tower. Elsewhere, such as Xincheng, Helan Mountain, Wangyuan Bridge, Xiaogong Bridge, Yanghe Fort, Wangtai Fort, and Wuzhong Fort... there are villas built by Ma Hongkui on occupied farmland.

The Ningxia Bank is Ma Hongkui's financial institution for plundering the people of Ningxia, monopolizing all of Ningxia's industry and commerce. Companies such as the Alcohol Company, Flour Company, Glass Company, Match Company, Tobacco Company, Alkali Plant, Iron Smelting Plant, Fuxing Wool Company, and Licorice Company are all operated or controlled by the bank. The Wool Company and Licorice Company monopolize all of the province's specialties, such as wool, cashmere, sheepskin, licorice, wolfberries, and black moss (private operation of the above-mentioned industries and commerce is prohibited). The bank issues high-interest loans every spring and collects wool, licorice, and other specialties in the autumn at spring prices, even though autumn prices are 60% higher than spring prices. If the people refuse to borrow, Ma Hongkui uses the Baojia heads to force the loans, and then uses the Baojia heads to collect the specialties. Under the Ma bandits' excessive taxation, the people are trapped in hunger and cold. The following folk song reveals a glimpse of the Ningxia people's lives:

Ningxia is pointed at both ends,
East side Yellow River, west side mountains,
Planting and harvesting year after year, irrigating the fields,
But still, every family has nothing to eat or wear,
Can't blame heaven.
The people of Ningxia have nothing to eat or wear,
The officials of Ningxia are happy;
The officials' surplus grain fills the granaries,
The officials' silver and money fill the houses,
All are the people's blood and sweat.
Suffering month after month, year after year,
Working hard from beginning to end;
Hoping to get rich next year,
But next year, wearing ripped pants,
It is so hard.

The suffering of the Ningxia people does not end there; the most tragic is the training and conscription of "National Soldiers." Ma Hongkui divided the province into four "National Soldier" training zones, each with a headquarters. All people between the ages of sixteen and sixty were required to gather for training on schedule and bear all expenses during the training period. In the sixteen years of Ma Hongkui's rule, there have been eighteen conscriptions; in 1933, one soldier was conscripted for every 85 mu of land, in 1934, 15 people were conscripted per Bao, in 1937, one out of every three men, or two out of five, in 1938, conscription by lottery, in 1940, Baojia heads were gathered for training (Baojia heads often hired people to train in their place), and after training they were incorporated into new soldiers, and in 1941, families were required to send soldiers, hence the folk song: "The rich buy soldiers and spend money, the poor send soldiers and lose sons." After 1942, soldiers were grabbed indiscriminately, with more than 112 soldiers conscripted from over 90 households in the second township of Tongxin County. This unlimited demand for soldiers led to the emergence of a market for buying and selling draftees, with a soldier costing as much as 20 million yuan in KMT currency. Li Wancai's family has hired over a hundred soldiers in the past decade. Ma Hongkui's forced training and conscription resulted in abandoned fields and broken families. Xu Jiqing of Daxin Canal, Qixiang, Babao, Jinji, had six brothers, all of whom were conscripted. The Bao head even sent people from his family to repair roads, with a penalty of three days for every day missed, forcing Xu's mother to repair the roads in tears. A family living at Qimaguan had only one son, who was forced to train, and the family had no food and could not live, so the whole family was forced to commit suicide. In Yaofu Fort, Pingluo, a family with two brothers had their younger brother conscripted, while the older brother maintained the family. Later, the older brother was forced to train, and when he returned, the family had already run out of food, so he killed his wife and children and hanged himself. In Xiegang Fort, Helan County, an old Hui man went to train, leaving his wife and three children at home. The wife could not make a living and went to find her husband, but the headquarters would not let them meet and forced the man to kneel in the playground, with a clay brick on his head. His wife returned home and killed her three children and then committed suicide. The things that happened because of training, broken families and death, were heard every day.

The people of Ningxia under the trampling hooves of Ma are like the Yellow River under the ice, waiting for the arrival of spring.

    “富宁夏”的惨象
    所谓“天下黄河富宁夏”，现在已变成了人间地狱。
    马鸿逵统治宁夏省十六年的杀人政治，在蒋管区内堪称“模范”。这里的人民不论男女老幼，也不管在家或外出都要带上“身份证”，生下娃娃死下老人来客住亲家都要报告，迟报一刻就要犯法，重者关监牢，轻者要受一顿饱打，一人犯法全家受累。村村镇镇，已沦到十室九空的境地，壮年被抓去当兵，老汉被拉去修路，婆姨娃娃坐在工厂里熬苦工。这里的苛捐杂税多如牛毛，公粮负担上有“国防粮”、“地亩粮”、“保甲粮”……老百姓一年辛辛苦苦收下的粮食都入了马家的仓库，弄得农民年年闹粮荒。马鸿逵每年春天把仓库底下沤了的粮食强迫散给老百姓，美其名曰“救济粮”或“种籽粮”，每斗不到五升；到秋后则每斗加三，还粮时要用风车扇过。其他如营业税、驼捐税、牲畜税、娱乐捐、宴席捐、房捐、航捐、屠宰捐、养路费等不胜枚举。对养羊户剥削更厉害，每年除纳照例的羊税外，每百只羊还要交二三十张皮子。马匪占领的盐池地区和同心县共二十三万八千只羊，每年羊捐即达二亿九千七百五十万元，另外还要出七万多张皮。肉铺买一只羊要上一万元税，杀后又得上四千屠宰税，每张羊皮交公只顶五百元（不准私卖）。去年马鸿逵准备进攻边区，勒索老百姓的马、骆驼、骡子、驴达一千多条。
    马鸿逵在宁夏城内成立了一个觉民学社，用拔兵的办法把老百姓的娃娃拉去，训练他们学戏，以卖戏赚钱，戏票四千元至八千元，卖不出去，便把票散给保甲长，强迫人民购买，不管你看不看戏，钱总得出。“航空救国奖券”亦用这个办法强迫向人民推销。
    宁夏城市的房子，据统计有四分之一为马鸿逵所霸占。其霸占的方法是以整顿市容为借口，限期要市民拆掉旧房，按规定重新修盖，市民无力时，马鸿逵的工程处便进行拆盖，盖好后要市民限期交清所费开支，如交不出，工程处便把房赁给原主，以房基为抵押，按期交不清租金时房子即为马鸿逵所有。
    马贼霸占了民田民房便大兴土木，到处修公馆。城内东花园有云亭（马鸿逵的父亲）纪念堂，信义街有大会馆和第一、二、三、四、五号公馆。北柴市有马家骅、马家驹（马鸿逵孙子）的公馆，芦席巷有马敦厚的公馆，复兴街有马敦静的公馆。西马营有怀远楼、工学楼，南关有宁静楼。其他如新城、贺兰山、望远桥、小公桥、杨和堡、王太堡、吴忠堡……都有马鸿逵霸占民田所修成的别墅。
    宁夏银行是马鸿逵掠夺宁夏人民的经济机关，垄断了全宁夏的工商业，如酒精公司、面粉公司、玻璃公司、火柴公司、烟草公司、碱精厂、炼铁厂、复兴羊毛公司、甘草公司等均为该行所经营或控制。羊毛公司和甘草公司，垄断了全省的羊毛羊绒、羊皮、甘草、枸杞、头发菜等特产（凡上述之工商业均禁止私人经营）。银行每年春天放高利贷，秋天按春价收羊毛、甘草等特产，秋价比春价高百分之六十。假如老百姓拒绝借贷，马鸿逵便经过保甲长把款子放下去，又经过保甲长把特产收回来。在马匪横征暴敛之下，人民陷于饥寒交迫之中，从下面的民谣中即可窥见宁夏人民生活的一斑了：
    宁夏川两头尖，
     东靠黄河西靠山，
     年种年收水浇田，
     到如今家家没吃穿，
     不能怨老天。
     宁夏的百姓没吃穿，
     宁夏的官家心喜欢；
     官家的余粮堆满仓，
     官家的银钱堆满房，
     都是百姓血汗。
     年年苦月月熬，
     一年到头勤苦劳；
     今年盼望来年富，
     到来年穿个破裆裤，
     实在太辛苦。
    宁夏人民的痛苦还不止此，最惨的是“国民兵”的训练和拔兵。马鸿逵把全省分为四个“国民兵”训练区，每区设司令部一处，凡十六岁以上六十岁以下者，均需按期集中受训，参加受训者要负担受训期间的一切费用。在马鸿逵统治的十六年当中，已拔了十八次兵了；民国二十二年每八十五亩地出兵一名，二十三年每保拔十五名，二十六年三丁一抽，五丁抽二，二十七年抽签拔兵，二十九年集中保甲长受训（保甲长多雇人受训），训后编为新兵，三十年合户出兵，因之有：“富人买兵舍了钱，穷人出兵舍了男”的民谣。三十一二年以后乱抓兵，同心县二乡九十余户就出兵一百一十二个。这样无限制的要兵，出现了买卖壮丁的市场，一个兵价高至蒋币二千多万元。李万才家，十数年来已雇兵百余人。马鸿逵强制人民受训和抓兵结果，造成田地荒芜和家破人亡的惨境，金积七乡八保大新渠徐吉庆，兄弟六人均被拔兵，保长还要派家里的人去修路，误一天罚三天，逼得徐母哭哭啼啼去修路。骑马关的一家居民仅有一男被迫受训，家中无粮没法生活，全家被迫自杀。平罗姚富堡一家兄弟两个，弟弟被拔去当兵，兄在维持全家生活，后被强迫受训，受训回来，家中早已断炊，遂把妻儿杀死，自己亦悬梁自缢。贺兰县谢岗堡一家老回回，男人去受训，家中留一妻三子，妻子在家无法维持生活去找男人，司令部不让见面，并罚男人跪在操场，头顶土坯。其妻回家把三个孩子杀死，自己也自杀了。因受训家破人亡的事情，是日有所闻的。
    马蹄残踏下的宁夏人民，正象冰封之下的黄水，等待着春天的到来。
