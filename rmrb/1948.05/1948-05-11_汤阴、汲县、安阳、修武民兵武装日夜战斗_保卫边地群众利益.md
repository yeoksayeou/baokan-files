Taihang News, 4th. The Tangyin local armed forces annihilated a KMT Home Guard (还乡团) company on the 20th of last month and won over more than 50 armed personnel from the enemy's Daxing Township government. At dawn on the 20th of last month, our Tangyin Independent Battalion, combined with the militia from the 4th and 5th districts of Junxian County, launched a sudden advance into the enemy's rear, fiercely attacking the 1st Company of the Tangyin Home Guard of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits stationed in Dajiangyao. The enemy fled in panic, and we pursued them for over eight miles to Xiaoruan Village, capturing 17 people including the company commander, and seizing 24 long and short guns. The next day, the Tangyin 5th District militia searched in all directions, capturing 3 more enemies and seizing 2 rifles and 1 light machine gun. In addition to lenient treatment, we further launched a political offensive against the captured enemies, winning over more than 50 armed personnel from the enemy's Daxing Township government, who defected to our side with their weapons. Thus, the enemy's Daxing Township government armed forces have been completely destroyed by us.

JiluYu News, 2nd. Approximately 200 militiamen from the 2nd, 4th, and 6th districts of Jixian County, led by District Chief Liu of the 6th district on April 24th, repelled the grain-grabbing attack of over 300 people from the pseudo-Jun, Qi, and Ji Counties Command and the ×Qiao Township government of Junxian County at Wangtun Village and Dianshang Village in the northwest corner of the 4th district. The enemy fled south in a panic. In a pursuit of seven or eight *li*, nine enemies were killed, more than ten were wounded, and one enemy was captured. We suffered no casualties.

This newspaper reports that the Anyang and Mashui village militias and working teams supported each other, defeated the enemy who were looting grain and conscripting soldiers, and protected the interests of the masses. On the night of the 13th of last month, more than 80 bandits from Liu Lexian's unit went to Beizhangwu and Qin Xiaotun in Anyang to loot grain and livestock. The Beizhangwu militia resisted bravely. At the same time, the Xigaoping militia immediately supported Beizhangwu, and the Nanguxian militia supported Qin Xiaotun. The bandits fled in panic, and two were wounded. The cattle, donkeys, etc., that had been looted were all recovered. On the night of the 14th, Liu's bandits, in coordination with the Home Guard, a total of more than 60 people, went to ×Jiazhuang in the 6th district to loot grain and conscript soldiers. Our Mashui Liuhe Village and Lingxuan militias and the 5th district militia working team actively supported them, defeating the enemy, liberating four conscripted men, and recovering two looted livestock, grain, clothing, and other items.

Taihang News, 4th. Since the rectification of the Xiuwu militia since the beginning of spring, the mass discipline in border area operations has been reviewed and corrected, and the combat effectiveness has been greatly improved. According to the Xiuwu County Armed Forces Committee, the county's militia fought a total of 103 battles in the first, second, and third months, killing 38 enemies, wounding 137, capturing 14 regular soldiers and 18 local tyrants and bullies, eliminating a total of more than 200 enemies, seizing 9 long and short guns, and recovering 15 heads of livestock looted from the masses. The militia in the 1st district of the county had the best combat record, killing, wounding, and capturing 54 enemies in March alone. The Xiuwu County Armed Forces Committee is now calling on the county's militia to learn from the militia in the 1st district, and to further launch a mine warfare and cold gun warfare to protect the spring plowing in the border areas and prepare to protect the wheat harvest.
