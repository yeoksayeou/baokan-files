【This Newspaper's News】Reporters from the General Branch reported that after the policy directives of the Central Bureau were issued, they were enthusiastically supported by the people throughout the region, and the broad masses of cadres were also working hard to study and review the past. However, a small number of comrades expressed indifference or passive resistance to correcting left-leaning adventurism: among them were district and village cadres, as well as county-level cadres. When the Eryang District of Yangcheng, Taiyue, convened a village cadre meeting, after explaining the policies, the village cadres did not publicize the policies towards the middle peasants, let alone compensate the middle peasants for their losses. In the past, four middle peasant households in the village of Xiakong were sealed, and two households in the village of Liu Shan were sealed, but they have not been unsealed to this day. People are in a panic, and production is slackening. Last winter, the Farmers' Association of Liuchang Village, Yangcheng, purged middle peasant members, and more than a dozen were purged from the two neighborhoods of Guang Wei's family alone; they controlled middle peasant production, ordering them to graze cattle, carry coal, and carry water for military families; working in kilns, the general wage was seven sheng of rice per day, but for middle peasants it was three sheng. The burden of corvée labor was also particularly heavy for middle peasants. Corvée labor was assigned and settled according to class background: poor peasants paid one sheng of rice for one less work-day and received three sheng of rice for one extra work-day, while middle peasants paid two sheng of rice for one less work-day and received two sheng of rice for one extra work-day. These errors in violation of policy are now being concealed by village cadres who are unwilling to correct them. The cadres of Fushan Village, Gaoping, secretly encroached upon the land and houses of fifteen middle peasant families. After the leadership discovered this, they ordered them to correct it, but they excused themselves by saying: "Some of these lands and houses have also been distributed to poor peasants. If they are withdrawn, it may affect the emotions of the poor and hired peasants." In Zhao Village, Gaoping, fifteen "households who have been struggled against" are under control, and the control over middle peasants is still very strict. The middle peasant Gao Sidui's family has five people, nine mu and eight fen of land, and a lame donkey. Sidui himself is under control in the saltpeter workshop, refining saltpeter, and pays 8,000 yuan to the poor and hired peasant group every month. His sixteen-year-old son pays 3,000 yuan per month, and the lame donkey pays 1,000 yuan per month. After the county authorities learned about this, they ordered the cancellation of the control twice, but the cadres of Zhao Village turned a deaf ear and are still controlling them. They dare to resist their superiors, knowingly violating the rules. In Taihang, many cadres also intentionally or unintentionally resist the correction of errors. In Weichang Village, the Fifth District of Lincheng, one hundred and sixty-seven households struggled against nineteen households, and six households were "enlightened," among which there were many wrongly struggled households. Recently, during the correction, after repeated discussions for two nights, it was still said that "from partiality we have moved towards the truth," and "spiritual resettlement has now been carried out." The issue of land, houses, and property was not mentioned at all. Many cadres have even more closed minds regarding the resettlement of landlords. The "Spring Plowing Circular" No. 2 of the Taihang Third Special Administrative Office contained an article entitled "Changzhi Jingfang Sub-district Holds Meeting to Review Spring Plowing," which still emphasized that "landlords must bow their heads to the peasants." What exactly counts as bowing their heads? It was not explained clearly. It only said that in Liling Village, the Second District of Changzhi, "the objects of struggle arrived early for the meeting, sitting in the front and being able to talk and laugh, simply becoming completely active elements, which made the poor and hired peasants feel hopeless and discouraged." After discussion, everyone believed that "no matter what, the current objects of struggle cannot be relieved of their control (not formal control), they must bow their heads and submit to the peasants..." The Special Administrative Office circulated this article to all counties without a word of criticism, as if it also agreed to continue the control. When the Taihang Xinhua Daily published this news, it did not dare to propose correction, but only deleted this passage. Liu Qianfeng, a reader from the Lin County government, wrote to say that after reading the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee on correcting left-leaning adventurism, "everyone felt that the turn was too fast." He said that resettling landlords was a blow to the peasants. Without struggling against landlords and industrialists and merchants, the peasants cannot turn over. With the cancellation of travel permits, it was felt that the landlords were too free, and one landlord even took the opportunity to escape. Landlords' freedom of marriage was too "lenient"..., etc. This can represent the ideological situation of some cadres towards correcting deviations, and the leadership urgently needs to pay attention to helping educate and correct errors.

Based on the above materials, we feel that on the one hand, it is necessary to conduct in-depth and extensive policy education for cadres and the masses, so that everyone understands that the policy is the highest interest of the masses, consciously and conscientiously implement it, and does not damage the entire cause due to local and immediate interests, or become demoralized due to correcting deviations. On the other hand, it is necessary to emphasize the seriousness of the policy, emphasize that cadres must firmly implement the Party's policy, and cannot continue to delay it under the pretext of being unable to get through ideological obstacles, making the policy a mere scrap of paper. At the same time, the leadership must personally conduct in-depth inspections at any time to supervise implementation. If there are still individuals who openly resist the Party's policy, in order to maintain the seriousness of the policy, necessary disciplinary action should be taken.

　　太行太岳少数干部抵抗纠偏
  　应深入检查教育纠正
  　县里两次叫取消至今还在管制着
    【本报消息】总分社记者报导，中央局政策指示发出后，获得全区人民热烈拥护，广大干部也在努力学习，检讨过去。但也有少数同志对纠正左倾冒险主义表示冷淡或消极抵抗：其中有区村干部，也有县级干部。太岳阳城二区召开村干部会议，讲明政策后，村干部回去不宣传对中农的政策，更不补偿中农损失。下孔村以前封了四户中农的门，刘善村封了两户，至今还没启封。人心慌慌，生产松懈。阳城留昌村农会去冬清洗中农会员，光卫家的两闾就清出十多个；管制中农生产，叫他们给军属放牛、担炭、担水；在窑上做活，每天一般工资米七升，中农是三升。支差负担，对中农也特别加重，支差按成份订分、结帐：贫农少一工出米一升，多一工得米三升，中农是少一工出二升，多一工得二升。这些违犯政策的错误，现在村干还想隐瞒起来，不愿改正。高平釜山村干，偷偷摸摸侵犯了十五家中农的土地房屋，领导上发觉后，让他们纠正，他们借口说：“这些土地房子也有分到贫农手中的，如抽出来，恐怕影响贫雇情绪。”高平赵庄管制着十五家“被斗户”，对中农还管制得很严。中农郜四堆，家里五口人，九亩八分地，一头拐驴。四堆本人管在硝房熬硝，每月交贫雇组八千元，十六岁的儿子每月交三千元，一个拐驴每月交一千元。县里知道后，曾两次叫取消管制，可是赵庄村干置若罔闻，至今还在管制。他们敢于对抗上级，明知故犯。太行在纠正错误时，也有不少干部有意无意的抵抗。临城五区围场村一百六十七户，斗争了十九户，“开明”了六户，其中有好些斗错的。最近纠正时，反复讨论了两晚上，始终是“从偏向上走向了真理”，“现在已经进行了精神上的安置”。土地房屋财产问题则根本没提。对于安置地主，很多干部更是思想不通。太行三专署“春耕通报”二期上载的“长治经坊小区开会检讨春耕”一文中，仍在强调“地主必须向农民低头”。究竟什么才算低头呢？没有说明白。只说长治二区“黎岭村斗争对象开会早到，坐在前边能说能笑，简直成了十足的积极分子，这样使得贫雇感到无望而泄气”。经过讨论，大家认为“无论怎样说，现在的斗争对象不能放弃了他们的管制（不是形式的管制），他们必须向农民低头服气………。”专署将此文通报各县，未有只字批评，好象也是同意继续管制的。太行新华日报登载这个消息时，也未敢提出纠正，只是把这段删了。林县县府读者刘前锋同志来信说，看了中央局给太岳区党委指示纠正左倾冒险主义后，“大家觉着转弯子太快了”。他说安置地主对农民是一种打击。不斗争地主工商业，农民不能翻身。取消了路条，觉得地主太自由了，还有一家地主乘机逃跑了。地主婚姻自由太“宽大”………等。这可以代表一部分干部对纠偏的思想状况，急需领导上注意帮助教育纠正错误。
    根据以上材料，我们觉得一方面需要对干部与群众进行深入广泛的政策教育，使大家了解政策即是群众的最高利益，自觉的认真执行，不致因局部的眼前的利益损害整个事业，或因纠偏而情绪低落。另一方面，必须强调政策的严肃性，强调干部必须坚定地执行党的政策，不能借口打不通思想一直拖下去，使政策变成空文。同时，领导上必须随时亲自深入检查，督促执行。如果还有个别的人公开抵抗党的政策，为了保持政策的严肃性，应该给以必要的纪律处分。
