To this end, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted: (1) Each national branch has the right to suggest including any issue it deems necessary on the agenda; (2) Executive Bureau meetings shall be held every three months, with the duration determined by the Chairman and the General Secretary, subject to the approval of the Executive Bureau members; (3) The WFTU's organs shall not attack the policies or administrative activities of national branches, but may issue objective statements; (4) The General Secretary, his assistants, and heads of departments shall not hold other positions without the permission of the Executive Bureau.
