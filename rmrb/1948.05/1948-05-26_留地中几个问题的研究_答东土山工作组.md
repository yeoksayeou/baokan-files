　　Research on Several Issues Regarding Land Retention
　　——Answer to the Dongtushan Work Group

　　Editor Comrade of Dongtushan Work Group:
　　1. The issue of absentee population in land distribution. There are about 160 people from this village working outside. There are roughly three situations. We used this method to deal with these three situations. We don't know if it is correct? A. Landlords and rich peasants who fled after being struggled against: Regarding the land allocated to landlords and rich peasants who fled, some people advocate that since they have not returned, the land should no longer be allocated. Some people advocate that in order to strive for their return, the land should be reserved for a limited period of three months. For poor peasants who ran away due to wrongful struggle, those who return within half a year will have land; otherwise, we will no longer wait. We believe that stipulating a time limit in this way has positive factors. It is not good to leave all land idle and allocate it upon return, but it is also inappropriate not to leave any land for those who ran away due to wrongful struggle. However, for large landlords who will not return, we will not leave any land at all. B. Businessmen working outside: We have studied that shopkeepers should not be allocated land because they do not rely on family support and will not engage in land production. If they are clerks and worked before three years before liberation, we believe that they must be working for a long time, so they should not be allocated land; if they only became clerks within the three years before liberation, there is still a possibility of being dismissed or quitting, so land should still be reserved. Because some people in Guandong recently returned before liberation, a one-year limit should also be set for them. C. Famine refugees: Those who fled before three years before liberation and have no news will not be allocated land. Those who still have news before liberation should have land reserved. Or, those who fled due to famine within the three years before liberation should also have land reserved, even if there is no news, for a period of three years. For famine refugees and businessmen who have land, the above time standard should also be used to decide whether to confiscate and distribute it. If there is a caretaker and they do not agree, we will not force it, but at least leave a graveyard.
　　The above questions all involve time limits, so we specifically inquire. In addition, regarding compensation for middle peasants, because middle peasants used to rent out land, which was settled under the rent reduction policy, we believe that it will no longer be returned, but the supplementary allocation must restore them to almost the original level, because the rent reduction policy was also correct at the time. (Wu'an Dongtushan Work Group)
　　Dongtushan Work Group: Regarding the conflict between compensating wrongly struggled middle peasants and the bulletin of "whoever cultivates it owns it," we are asking the Taihang Administrative Office to study and reply, and will inform you when we have a reply. Now, we will first reply to the issue of land distribution for absentee population as follows: A. Landlords and rich peasants who fled after being struggled against should be allocated a share of land in the supplementary allocation according to law, and it should be retained by the peasants' association in order to strive for their return to participate in production. It is wrong not to reserve land for them. Your stipulation of three months is worth considering. Middle and poor peasants who fled due to wrongful struggle should be compensated and allocated land. They fled because of wrongful struggle, and now we should admit our mistakes to them and compensate for the losses. Limiting the period to half a year is wrong. Once these households understand the policy, they will return. Your practice of limiting the period to three years for famine refugees, but only three months or six months for these households, reflects that your understanding of the rectification work still has deviations. We hope you will conduct a review. At the same time, it is also wrong to say that no land will be reserved for large landlords who will not return. The Land Law Outline stipulates that only traitors, national betrayers, and those guilty of civil war will not be allocated land or property. Now, giving them a share according to law can strive for their return. B. Regarding the land distribution for merchants and shop assistants, the main thing to consider is their income situation. As for the shopkeepers you mentioned, if they do not rely on family support, they naturally do not need to be allocated land. At the same time, if their income is relatively high and they can still provide part of the family expenses, their family can also be allocated less land depending on the situation. Generally, shop assistants should be allocated all or part of their land depending on the specific situation. It is not appropriate for you to use the length of time engaged in shop assistant life as a standard, because the length of time alone cannot show their occupational income situation and whether there is a possibility of being dismissed. C. The land of famine refugees should be left for a certain period of time. In addition, the peasants' association should retain a considerable amount of public land, ready to adjust for returning households. The supplementary measures of the Land Law Outline stipulate that famine refugees and immigrants can only be assigned a share in one place, and cannot be assigned in both places. Therefore, those who have settled and been assigned land elsewhere cannot be assigned land in their old home. In the supplementary allocation, there is no need to reserve land for them according to the population. All these reserved lands should be kept by the village peasants' association before the person returns, and temporarily lent to poor peasants or other poor peasants for cultivation, without renting out, only paying burdens.
　　Your handling of the middle peasants who were liquidated during the rent reduction is correct. ——Editor

### 留地中几个问题的研究——答东土山工作组

　　留地中几个问题的研究
    ——答东土山工作组编辑同志：
    一、分地中外出人口问题。这村在外一百六十口上下，大体三种情况，对这三种情况，我们用了这个办法，不知对否？甲、被斗逃亡户：对地富逃亡的分土地，有人主张现在既未回来，就不再分配，有人主张为争取他们回来，再限期三个月。对错斗中贫农跑的，半年归回者有土地，否则不再等。这样规定年限，我们认为是有积极因素的，都留闲地，回来就分配这不好，不留因斗错而跑，也不合适，但对不会回来的大地主，则根本不留。二、在外经商人：我们研究掌柜不分，因他不靠家庭生活，也不会进行土地生产，如系店员，我们觉得在解放前三年之前的，因他一定要长期干，故也不分地；在解放前三年中才干店员，还有被解雇和自己不干的可能，所以还留地，因为解放前在关东，最近有回来的，对他们也一定一年为限。三、逃荒户：在解放前三年之前，逃出的根本无音信，即不分田。在解放前还有信者要留地。或者在解放前三年中因灾荒逃出的，虽无音信也留地，三年为期限。以上逃荒户和商人如有土地，也按上述时间标准，决定是否没收分配，如果有代管人，人家不同意者，也就不勉强，而同时至少要留坟地。
    以上问题都已牵涉到年限，特询问。另外补偿中农中，因中农曾有出租地，在减租政策下被清算了的，我们认为不再退，但抽补中一定要恢复到差不多原来的程度，因当时减租政策也是对的。　　　　　（武安东土山工作组）
    东土山工作组：关于补偿错斗中农与谁种谁收布告冲突问题，我们正请太行行署研究答复，待有回音再告。现先把外出人口分地问题答复如下：甲、被斗逃亡户在填补中应依法分给他们一份土地，留在农会，以争取他们回来参加生产。不给他们留地是错误的。你们规定三个月是值得考虑的。错斗的中贫农逃跑在外的，更应一律补偿，分给土地，他们逃跑是因为错斗，现在应向他们承认错误补偿损失，限期半年是错误的。这些户只要了解了政策，他们就会回来的。你们对逃荒户限期三年，对这些户却只限期三个月或六个月的作法，反映出你们思想上对纠偏工作的认识仍有偏差，望作检查。同时说不会回来的大地主根本不留地也是错误的，土地法大纲规定只有汉奸卖国贼及内战罪犯本人才不分给土地财产。现在依法给他们一份，就可以争取他们回来。乙、商人店员分地问题，主要看他们的收入情况，你们所说的掌柜的，如不靠家庭生活自然不须分土地。同时若收入较多，尚可供给一部家庭费用，其家庭也可酌量情况少分土地。一般店员要酌量具体情况分给他们全部或一部土地。你们单以从事店员生活年限为标准是不太合适的，因为单凭年限并不能看出他们的职业收入情况和有无解雇的可能的。丙、逃荒户自己的土地应给留下至一定年限，另外有农会中留下相当数量的公地，准备调剂回来户。土地法大纲补充办法规定：逃荒户移民只能确定在一个地方分一份，不得两头重分。所以已在外安家分地的，老家就不能再分。填补中也就勿须按人口给他们留地。所有这些留下的地，在其本人未回来前，应由村农会保管，暂借给贫雇农或其他贫农耕种，不出租，只纳负担。
    在减租时清算的中农，你们的处理办法是对的。　　——编者
