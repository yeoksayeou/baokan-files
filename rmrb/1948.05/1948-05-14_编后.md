    ▲ The Changyuan County Party Committee's investigation of the chaotic situation below is the first relatively comprehensive report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area in several months. This is a welcome phenomenon. We hope that the branch offices and correspondents will make efforts to reflect the real situation. This news shows that the chaotic situation in various parts of Hebei-Shandong-Henan is very serious and should arouse vigilance. We must seriously check and correct deviations.
    ▲ From the Changyuan County Party Committee's investigation, we believe that there are still many remnants of "leftism." We specially propose the following for study: 1. When analyzing the situation of the middle peasants, it was considered that the middle peasants were "pretending to be poor and complaining," and the fundamental reasons were not sought from the infringement of the interests of the middle peasants. 2. The analysis of the village cadres' situation is: some people have no heart to serve the masses, some people are negative and pessimistic, and some people do not transform and their wings have hardened. Wouldn't this mean that there is not a single good one? The result of this analysis will hinder our education and transformation of village cadres, and at the same time, it will not allow us to further identify problems from the leadership and correct the "leftist" phenomenon of party rectification and cadre rectification.
    ▲ The production situation mentioned after the Changyuan news is good. According to the situation in Taihang and Taiyue, reversing such a situation is not an easy task. Branch offices and correspondents should not be misled by certain individual production phenomena. They should go deep into the masses to carefully check whether deviations are being corrected and what new problems are arising. It is important to prevent superficiality.
    ▲ The Dongchan work group in Ping'an Fifth District checking deviations according to the instructions of the Central Bureau is good. From the submitted manuscript, it seems not thorough enough. Everyone thinks that the mistake lies in beating a Cheng Cao Suo, and the other thirty-five party members have been rectified very smoothly. Is this really the case? Judging from the ideological situation of the work group's self-reflection, there is much room for doubt. Please re-examine.

    ▲长垣县委检查下面混乱现象是几个月来第一次从冀鲁豫区来的比较全面的报导。这是可喜的现象。希望分社及通讯员努力将真实情况反映上来，这条消息说明冀鲁豫各地混乱现象是很严重的，应引起警惕，认真检查，纠正偏向。
    ▲从长垣县委检查中我们认为还有不少左的残余特提出研究：一、分析中农情况时，认为中农是“装穷诉苦”，没有从侵犯中农利益上去找根本原因。二、对村干情况的分析是：一种人没心为群众服务，一种人消极悲观，一种是不转变，翅膀硬了，这样岂不一个好的也没有了吗？这样分析的结果，将会妨碍我们对村干的教育和改造，同时也不能更进一步从领导上找出毛病纠正整党整干的左倾现象。
    ▲长垣消息后边所提出的生产情形是好的，根据太行太岳情况，扭转这样一个局面并不是一件轻而易举的事，分社及通讯员不应为某些个别生产现象所迷惑、要深入群众认真检查偏向是否在纠正？又有什么新的问题在发生？一定要防止客里空。
    ▲平顺五区东禅工作组根据中央局指示检查偏向是好的，从来稿看似还不彻底，大家觉得错误就在于打了一个程曹锁，其他三十五个党员都整的很顺利，是否就是如此，从工作组反省的思想情况来看，大有可怀疑地方，请再作检查。
