Changzhi News: The Nan Street of the Second District of Changzhi Municipality sealed several shops, including those of Xu Dehe and others, during the re-examination of eliminating feudalism in July of last year. After the municipal party committee's expanded cadre meeting in early April, cadres from the Second District went to various streets to promote the policy on industry and commerce and to understand the situation in depth. After discovering these situations and conducting research, they decided to unseal all the industrial and commercial enterprises that had been wrongly struggled against and sealed, returning them to their original owners to operate themselves. Then, they convened a meeting of cadres and the masses to explain the situation and our party's policy on industry and commerce, allowing the masses to deliberate and discuss. Everyone said, "Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the city to eat the city; we make a living by doing business." Everyone unanimously agreed to return Xu Dehe's sealed industrial and commercial property to him for his own operation. Following this, the family property and municipal housing of the handicraft worker Song Dehe, which had been wrongly sealed last winter, were also unsealed and returned to the original owner. After this resolution, Xu Dehe and Song Dehe pledged that they would ensure no waste in the future and would develop industry and commerce well to develop themselves. In Xin Nan Street, after the Outline Land Law was issued last winter, Dong Zhucai, a small merchant, was afraid because he did not understand the policy, and secretly took out eight large boxes of needles at night and also gave the cadres 15,000 yuan. At that time, the masses believed that he was undermining the Outline Land Law, so they confiscated his needles and silver dollars and kept them in the poor people's association. After the municipal cadres studied the urban economic policy this time, they realized that this practice was wrong. Therefore, on the night of April 28th, they held a mass meeting to explain that the party's policy is to resolutely protect industry and commerce, and let the masses discuss it. Everyone unanimously believed that industrial and commercial businesses that were wrongly struggled against should be returned to their original owners, and the eight large boxes of needles (worth over 300,000 yuan) and 15,000 yuan were immediately returned to Dong Zhucai. After doing this, Liu Dexi, a handicraft worker, said on the spot: "From now on, my mind is at ease." He decided to greatly develop his business. (Ren Qing, Wu Ji, Wen Bei)

【Another News】After the cadres of the Lower East Street of the Third District of Changzhi Municipality re-examined how to implement the industrial and commercial policy at the district cadre expanded meeting on April 23, they then inspected the work of the past month. Although there has been new development, it is not yet consolidated, and there are suspicions and concerns. Some said: "Now we are engaged in production, and in the autumn we will engage in struggle." Everyone realized from this that just giving lip service and not returning the wrongly struggled against industrial and commercial enterprises, and not solving the problem of involuntary mutual aid organizations, is just empty talk. Therefore, as soon as they returned to the street, they conducted individual deliberation and investigation. After six or seven days, they discovered many problems. Hao Wanyong said: "Liu Mize has been carrying a peddler's pole since he was a child with his father, selling needles, thread, towels, and belts, saving every penny. Later, he developed into a small dye shop. When cutting off the tail of capitalism, there was no definition of class, and seeing the seven mu of land he rented outside, they treated him as a business landlord and struggled against him." Li Erguo of Tongyihe Meat Shop said: "In the past, I had my own small stall. The government called on us to organize, so I quickly voluntarily combined with two people to set up a meat shop. At that time, the branch secretary Liu Faze told us to organize into mass production, but I disagreed and didn't dare to say it. As a result, 360,000 yuan of mass capital was accumulated, and four more people were added. After more than ten months, the shareholders did not receive any dividends. I became afraid in my mind. Now that we are engaged in production, can I do it myself? The capital is also enough." Liu Fanhai of Tongsheng Leather Workshop also asked: Can we people also do it ourselves (they were also previously organized involuntarily)? After discovering these problems, after research, on May 1st, Liu Mize's 450,000 yuan was officially returned at the mass meeting. If this money is not enough, low-interest loans or interest-free loans can also be used to help him continue his business. In addition, 23 households who had been struggled against had their industrial and commercial investment of 480,000 yuan, wages of 50,000 yuan, one Wang Xiuzhen weaving machine, and four zhang of cloth (deducted from landlords last winter) returned. Li Erguo happily said: "If there are still poor people who have no labor, we can continue to lead production." Yu Jingyi said: "Then I will dare to develop boldly." Niu Huaize said: "If I had known it would be like this, I shouldn't have spent that 400,000 yuan so carelessly." Liu Fanhai actively bought a big cart to take over the leather workshop, Shen Yuanbao and four others discussed setting up a shop, Han Shuangze began to set up a mill, and Wu Tianshun wanted to buy an old mill to engage in production. From then on, it became more and more active every day. (Guo Ben, Yu Jing, Niu Xing, Qi Xiang)

    长市二区按政策办事
    错封商店开了门
    【长治消息】长市二区南街在去年七月复查挤封建时，查封了徐德和等好几家商店。四月初市委扩干会后，二区干部分头到各街宣传工商业政策，深入了解情况。发现这些情形以后，经过研究，就确定错斗查封的工商业全部启封，退还原主，让他自己经营。接着就召开干部群众会，说明情况和我党工商业政策，让群众酝酿讨论。大家都纷纷说：“靠山吃山，靠城吃城，咱做买卖就要吃买卖。”大家一致通过将徐德和已封的工商业财产，退给他自己经营。接着又将去冬错封了的手工业者宋德和的家财市房，也开了封，交还原主。经这样解决后，徐德和与宋德和提出自己今后保证不浪费，好好发展工商业发展自己。新南街在去年冬土地法大纲下来后，小商人董主才，因不了解政策害怕，黑夜即私拿出针八大盒，还送给干部一万五千元，当时群众认为他是破坏土地法大纲，即把他的针和洋全部没收，保存在贫民会。这次市干部学习城市经济政策后，了解到这样做法是错误的，特于四月二十八日夜召开群众大会，说明党的政策是坚决保护工商业的，并让群众讨论，大家一致认为错斗工商业归还原主，当即将八大盒针（约值三十多万元）和一万五千元钱退给董主才。这样一做，当场有手工业工人刘德喜说：“这以后我的心就放下啦。”决定大大发展营业。    （任卿、五吉、文北）
    【又息】长市三区下东街干部在四月二十三日区干扩大会议重新研究如何贯彻执行工商业政策后，接着检查一月来的工作。虽有新的发展，但还不巩固，有怀疑和顾虑。有的说：“现在搞生产，秋后搞斗争。”大家从这里认识到光口头宣传，不退还错斗工商业，不解决不自愿的互助组织问题，就都是说空话。因此一回街便进行个别酝酿、调查，经过六七天，发现了很多问题。郝万永说：“刘迷则从小跟他父亲担着个货郎担，卖针线、手巾、带子，省吃俭用，后来发展成个染料小铺，在割尾巴时，划阶级也没有个定义，看见他在外租的七亩地，就把他当经营地主斗争了。”同义合肉铺李二过说：“过去我自己摆的个小摊子，政府号召组织起来，我就赶快自愿结合了两个人搞了个肉铺，当时支书刘法则叫我们组织成群众生产，我不同意，也不敢说。结果积了群众卅六万元资本，又增加四个人，搞了十一个多月，股东也没有分到红利。在我思想上害怕起来。现在搞生产，我是不是能自己搞？资本也够了。”同胜皮坊刘反孩也这样问：我们这几个人是不是也能自己来搞（他们也是以前不自愿组织起来的）？发现了这些问题后，经过研究，五月一日在群众大会上正式退还了刘迷则的四十五万元。如果这些钱不够，还可以低利贷款或无利贷款来帮助他继续经营。另外还退了二十三个被斗户工商投资四十八万元，工资五万元，王秀珍织布机一个，布四丈（去冬管理地主扣下的）。李二过高兴的说：“如果还有没劳力的贫民，我们还可以继续带领生产。”于景宜说：“这我就敢大胆发展了。”牛怀则说：“要早知道是这样，我可不该把那四十多万元乱零花了。”刘反孩积极买大车接收皮坊，申元宝等四人商量搞商店，韩双则开始搞磨坊，武天顺要买老磨坊搞生产。从此一天天活跃起来。    （过本、玉景、牛兴、奇祥）
