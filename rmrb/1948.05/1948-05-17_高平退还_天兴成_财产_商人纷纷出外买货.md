Gaoping Returns "Tianxingcheng" Property
　　Merchants Go Out to Buy Goods
    [Gaoping News] Commerce in Gaoping city was never very developed. Before the War of Resistance, there were over two hundred businesses, but only about twenty were substantial. During the period of the Japanese puppet regime, most were destroyed. Apart from the Korean businesses brought by the enemy, only a small number of small shops and restaurants remained. Since liberation, it has developed to 302 businesses, but the capital is very small, with fewer than five (joint public-private) having between one and two million, and most having thirty, twenty, or as little as three or two hundred thousand. Three storefronts were reduced to two, and two were reduced to one. During the big movement, forty-one shops were affected by the liquidation. Among them, nine were overthrown and closed. Before last autumn, when squeezing out feudalism, the Chamber of Commerce directly liquidated five. It was planned to liquidate several more, but it was stopped later, but the impact was huge. For example, Han Tianqin, the owner of Tianxingcheng store (from Quzhou County, Hebei), went to Handan not long after liberation; leaving his wife and daughter to run a small cloth shop selling pigments. Thirty-two years ago, he lent a small amount of usury and rented out a few acres of land; because he privately bought silver dollars, he was discovered by the Chamber of Commerce and immediately subjected to struggle. The cadres of the urban area were afraid that the Chamber of Commerce would swallow the fruits alone, and mobilized the masses to propose a joint struggle between commerce and agriculture. As a result, he was driven out of his home. Later, four more were struggled against, saying that they had been Chamber of Commerce cadres during the period of the Japanese puppet regime and had embezzled money. This year in the first month of the lunar calendar, more than ten people asked to close their businesses and return home to farm. Li Xueyi of Yiji said, "Last year, every time I heard the gong, my heart jumped. Even if there was business, I couldn't concentrate on it." Wei Ziguo said, "Last year, I didn't dare to put some goods outside, for fear that people would see them and say I had a way, and even if there was no struggle, the burden would be heavier." Yue Liangyu said, "Last year, who dared to bring goods to the street during the day? They all came at dusk when no one could be seen on the street. Everyone was afraid of Lao Jiao and Section Chief Pan (Industry and Commerce Tax Bureau). When they came, they checked accounts and goods. They didn't know that these small merchants relied on people to extend credit from outside."
    After the promulgation of the Land Law, merchants were still skeptical about the protection of industry and commerce. But they were very concerned about our policies. As soon as the newspaper arrived, a group of people gathered around the counter to read it. After the Central Bureau's instructions on correcting the "leftist" adventurism and industrial and commercial policies by the Taiyue District Party Committee were publicized on April 25, the government first officially announced the handling of the infringement of the Tianxingcheng store. All his confiscated items were returned in their original state; the pigments that had been sold, along with the loan from last winter, were loaned to the poor to produce, and the principal and interest would be returned to the original owner when due. The sale of silver dollars was confiscated in accordance with Article 5 of the Border Government's proclamation of June 12, 1936. All other remaining goods and furniture were returned in full, worth more than two million yuan. Tianxingcheng officially started business in its original store on the first of this month. After these few days, the street is indeed livelier than before. The pigments and porcelain teacups that had been hidden in the past have also been put out, and more people are going out to buy goods. Ji Yongxiang had never been to Changzhi to buy goods, but this time he went to buy goods. Some shops are renovating their storefronts and making big signs, preparing to do a big business. The masses all said, "The business on Gaoping Street will be very lively!" In recent days, four or five villagers have come to the city to look for city houses, preparing to open shops. Some merchants have proposed that the bank loan period is too short and requested a longer period; some merchants have to provide labor service in both places, providing it in the city and also having to provide labor service grain at home; these issues are being studied and addressed.

　　高平退还“天兴成”财产
  　商人纷纷出外买货
    【高平消息】高平城内商业本来就不算发达。抗战前有二百多家，象样的不过二十家左右，敌伪时期大部摧垮。敌人带来的朝鲜生意除外，就仅留极少数的小商店和小饭铺。解放后到现在，发展成三百零二家，但资本很小，一百万至二百万不够五家（公私合营），大多数是三十万、二十万，少至三万、二万。由三间门面缩小至两间，由两间缩小为一间。大运动中，被清算而动着商店的有四十一家。其中被斗垮关门有九家。去年秋前挤封建时，商联会直接清算了五家。还计划清算几家，后来制止了，但影响极大。如天兴成店东韩天勤（河北曲周县人），解放不久就往邯郸去了；丢下老婆闺女开个小布店卖颜料。三十二年前放过少数高利贷，出租过几亩地；因私买现洋，被商联会发觉，即进行斗争。城关干部恐怕商联会独吞果实，发动群众提议，进行商农联合斗争。结果斗了个扫地出门。后来又斗了四家，说是敌伪时期当过商会干部，有贪污。今年阴历正月，即有十多家要求歇业，回家种地。义记李学义说：“去年我一听打锣，心里就跳。有生意也做不到心上。”卫子果说：“去年有些货也不敢往外摆，怕人家看见说有办法，不斗争也要加重负担。”悦良玉说：“去年街上来货，谁家敢白天来？都是傍黑街上看不见人时才进来的。都怕老焦和潘股长（工商税务局），他们来了，查帐查货，不知这些小商人都是凭人哩，在外边赊欠人家的。”
    土地法颁布后，商人们对保护工商业还是怀疑。但对我政策却很关心，报纸一来，柜台围着一伙人看报。经过四月二十五日宣传了中央局指示太岳区党委纠正左倾冒险主义及工商业政策后，政府首先正式宣布对侵犯天兴成商店处理办法。所有没收他的东西，原物退还；颜料已卖，与去冬贷款一并贷给了雇贫生产，到期要本利归还原主。贩卖现洋，按照边府三十六年六月十二日布告第五条规定，给以没收。其余所存一切货物家具如数归还，价值二百万元以上。天兴成于本月一日在原来的商店里正式开始营业，经过这几天以后，街上确实比以前热闹了。过去埋藏了的颜料、洋磁茶缸等，也摆出来了，到外边去办货的也多了。姬永祥始终没有去长治买过货，这次也去办货了。有的商店在装修门面，做大招牌，准备大干。群众都说：“高平街上的生意还要很热闹哩！”近几天即有四五个乡下人来城里找市房，准备开商店。有的商人提出银行贷款期限短，要求限长些；有的商人两头支差，在城里支了，家里还得出支差米；这些问题正在研究处理。
