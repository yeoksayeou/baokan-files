To the Editor:

Daxinzhuang is a central market town in the Fourth District of Weixian County and the seat of the district government. Previously, there were 279 households; after liberation, due to family separations, there are now approximately 300 households. Land is relatively concentrated, with many poor peasants, few middle peasants, and many immigrants, so there are also many small merchants and vendors.

Although severely devastated during the War of Resistance and the subsequent year of occupation, after liberation, the market in this village quickly recovered and became very active. Later, due to our excessively heavy taxation, it declined and became desolate. Eleven steamed bun shops are now all gone; more than 50 small merchants are now only about ten. The original market was large, with grain shops, cloth shops, flower markets, oil, salt, vegetables, firewood, grass, peanuts, etc.; now the market has shrunk by four-fifths. Merchants in this village who have closed or lost their jobs account for 80 percent.

According to our preliminary understanding, the main reasons for the shrinking of the market and the closure and unemployment of merchants in this village are: (1) The change to the city scale is not uniform; other places have not changed, and merchants have no profit. (2) The main reason is that the tax is too heavy, unfair, and unreasonable. Some have even sold their donkeys and furniture to pay business tax, resulting in unemployment. Some dare not continue because of further heavy taxation (semi-annual tax collection). For example, Li Tangxin is an outsider who has been a barber for six generations, with a family of six, including four children and his wife. He has only two and a half mu of sandy land and contracted tuberculosis due to fleeing the famine, relying entirely on barbering to make a living. However, during last year's tax collection, his capital was assessed at 60,000 yuan, and he was forced to pay 18,000 yuan in tax. After asking someone to intercede, he paid 16,200 yuan to settle the matter. Zhang Caiyun is over 50 years old, with a family of seven, including four children and her widowed sister-in-law, with seven and a half mu of land, six mu of which is mortgaged. She runs a teahouse in the street. When the tax was levied, she was assessed at 140,000 yuan. Helpless, the whole family cried all night, and later sold half a donkey. After asking someone to intercede, she paid 30,000 yuan to settle the matter. Cheng Shigu sells water; based on a daily profit of 500 yuan, he should pay 100 yuan in tax daily, amounting to 18,000 yuan in half a year. After intercession, he paid 9,000 yuan. Guo Qinglin sells peanuts (from a basket) with a total capital of 4,500 yuan, only did business for a little over a month, and also paid 3,000 yuan in tax, losing half of his capital. Ren Shoushan, with a cotton fluffer’s bow, had the bow and donkey calculated as capital during tax assessment, based on four months, and paid 81,700 yuan. Similar situations are numerous and will not be detailed. In short, all business activities are taxed. For example, sellers of old tofu, peddlers, peanut sellers, and small blacksmiths must pay tax and obtain a business license; otherwise, they cannot open for business. In addition, merchants feel that the "turnover tax" is too heavy, i.e., tax on both ends. Regardless of profit or loss, there is a uniform 10 percent tax on slaughtering pigs. The profit is then taxed at 2,000 yuan per 10,000 yuan.

The commission earned by brokers in various industries is reduced by 700 yuan per 1,000 yuan by the exchange. Therefore, even brokers are constantly complaining. After the exchange takes its share, they cannot even earn enough for a meal per market day. After discovering the above situation, the work team first convened a dozen small-scale merchant forums. At the meetings, everyone was very enthusiastic and very concerned about industrial and commercial policies; during the meetings, more than 20 people automatically came to listen. At various meetings, people constantly asked to have industrial and commercial policies explained to them. Many merchants brought their tax licenses and business permits from last winter for the work team members to see. The work team comrades explained industrial and commercial policies to them, followed by discussions on future measures. However, in the discussion, the above problems were discovered, and we are not sure how to address them, so please provide answers.

Although the Central Bureau's instructions on industrial and commercial policies and Comrade Chen Boda's article are very clear, they are not specific enough for rural small vendors. Therefore, small vendors dare not believe it boldly, and the work team does not dare to interpret it with certainty. For example, is a business license required? Will small merchants and vendors still pay taxes this summer? According to the Central Bureau's instructions, commerce is taxed at 15 percent. Last year, it was 20 percent. Because rural small vendors are different from urban and larger market town industrial and commercial enterprises, small merchants have great doubts about this. Therefore, please provide clear answers to the editor. Rural small vendors often engage in agriculture at the same time. If they pay taxes once every six months, because business time is uncertain, they feel they cannot afford it. Therefore, they want clear and distinct regulations. Also, please inform us whether the turnover tax on slaughtering pigs and sheep will be abolished.

In addition, we suggest that the industrial and commercial departments conduct a serious inspection of past tax collections to see if similar problems exist.

### 对小商贩征税问题的意见

　　对小商贩征税问题的意见编辑同志：
    大辛庄是魏县四区一个中心集市，又是区公所驻地。以前二百七十九户，解放后因家庭分居，现约三百户。土地较集中，贫农多、中农少、移民很多，故小商人及小商贩亦较多。
    抗战时期及去年沦陷后，虽备受摧残，但解放后，该村集市又很快恢复繁荣，并非常活跃。后因我征税太重，又转而衰落萧条。馒头房十一家，现在一家也没有了；小商人五十余家，现在只有十来家了。原来集市很大，有粮行、布行、花市、油、盐、菜、柴、草、花生等，现在集市缩小了五分之四。本村商人停业与失业者共占百分之八十。
    据我们初步了解，这村集市缩小及商人停业失业的主要原因是：（一）改用市秤不统一，别的地方未改，商人无利。（二）但主要原因是税收过重，而又不公道，不合理。有的因出商业税，竟把毛驴家具卖掉，因而失业。也有因为再出重税（半年一次税收）而不敢再干者。比如说吧：李堂新是个外来户，剃头六辈子，六口人，四个小孩和他老婆。就二亩半沙地，因逃荒积成肺痨病，全靠剃头维持生活。但去年税收时，定他六万元的资本，硬让出一万八千元税。后经托人说合，出了一万六千二百元才算完事。张彩云五十多岁了，七口人，四个孩子和他一个寡妇嫂，七亩半地，六亩是活契地，在街开茶馆。征税时，征他十四万。无办法，全家哭了一夜，后来把半个驴卖了。经托人说合，出了三万元才算了事。程士古卖水，按每日赚洋五百元计，每日应抽交税洋一百元，半年应出一万八千元，后经说合，出了九千元。郭庆林卖花生（篮子），共四千五百元本钱，只干了一月多，也出了三千元的税，把本钱弄走一半。任寿山，四股一个弹花弓，征税时把弓和驴都打成本钱折合起来，按四个月，出了八万一千七百元。类似这种情况还很多，不详述。总之，凡是买卖性质，无不出税。比如卖老豆腐、张罗的、卖花生的、小炉匠等，都得出税领营业证，否则不能开张营业。另外就是商人对掉头税亦感太重，即两头税。杀猪不管赔赚，一律按百分之十征税。其红利又按每万元抽二千元税。
    各行业的经纪所得佣钱，每千元即被交易所抽去七百元。因此当经纪亦是连声叫苦。每集除交易所抽出去，挣不了顿干粮吃。工作组发现以上情况后，先召集开了十来个小型商人座谈会。会议上，大家情绪特别高，对工商业政策非常关心；会议进行中，并有二十余人自动前来听会。在各种会议上，不断有人提出要给他们讲读工商政策。有许多商人把去冬的税收执照及营业证拿来让工作员看。工作组同志给他们解释工商业政策，继之讨论今后办法。但在讨论中发现以上问题，不敢肯定，请予解答。
    中央局对工商政策的指示及陈伯达同志的文章里，虽然很明确，但对农村的小商贩还不够明确具体。因此小商贩对此还不敢大胆相信，工作组也不敢大胆肯定的解释。如营业证是否领？今夏小商人小商贩是否还出税？如按中央局指示，商业按百分之十五抽税。去年是百分之二十。因乡村小商贩与城市及较大集镇工商业不同，故小商人对此还有很大疑虑。因此请编辑同志明确解答。乡村小商贩多是兼搞农业，如果半年出一次税，因生意时间不定，也觉得拿不起。因此愿有分别明确的规定。再就是杀猪杀羊的掉头税是否取消？也望示知。
    另外我们建议工商部门应对过去的税收作一认真的检查，是否有同样问题存在。
