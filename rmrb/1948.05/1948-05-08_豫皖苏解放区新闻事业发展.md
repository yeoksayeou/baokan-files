In addition to the Xuefeng Daily, which serves the entire region, there is the Vanguard Daily of the First Sub-district, the Masses Daily and the Outpost Daily of the Second Sub-district, the Counter-offensive Daily of the Third Sub-district, the Pioneer Daily and the Red Star Daily of the Fifth Sub-district, the Army Building Daily of the Military Region, and the Solidarity Daily, Current Events News, etc., of various troops, totaling more than ten kinds. The Xuefeng Daily is printed with lead type, four pages in quarto, and has a daily circulation of 3,000 copies. When the Chiang bandits attacked the year before last, the newspaper was changed to mimeograph. During the war, it always adhered to the news front behind Chiang, and the daily publication of news bulletins with the army never stopped, which played a great role in boosting the morale of the military and civilians. After the great counter-offensive, preparations began to restore lead printing. The workers of the newspaper factory rushed to cast all the lead type in 27 days, and built a light and flexible printing factory suitable for movement in combat, so that the Xuefeng Daily restored the lead printing version on the 20th of this month. In order to welcome May Day, the factory plans to increase production by two-thirds.

　　豫皖苏解放区新闻事业发展
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖三日电】豫皖苏解放区新闻事业日益发展，现已建立有新华社豫皖苏分社及若干支社，拥有通讯员五百人以上。报纸除全区性的雪枫报外，尚有一分区之前卫报，二分区之群众报、前哨报，三分区之反攻报，五分区之先锋报、红星报，军区之建军报及各部队之团结报，时事新闻等共达十余种。雪枫报为铅印，四开四版，日发三千份。该报于前年蒋匪进攻时改为油印，战争中始终坚持蒋后新闻阵地，随军每日出刊新闻快报从未间断，对鼓舞军民斗志作用很大。大反攻后即开始筹备恢复铅印，该报工友在二十七天中突击铸成全部铅字，并建设了一个轻便灵活适合战斗中运动的印刷工厂，使雪枫报于本月二十日恢复铅印版。为迎接五一，该厂计划提高生产三分之二。
