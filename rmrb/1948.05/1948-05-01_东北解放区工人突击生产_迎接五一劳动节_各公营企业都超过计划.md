Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th—Workers in factories, railways, and mines in the Northeast Liberated Areas are launching a crash production drive with a fighting spirit to greet the “May 1st” Labor Day. All publicly owned enterprises have achieved significant results in the crash production drive. In a certain electric power bureau, after the collective meritorious service campaign began, there were very few machine failures last month, and fuel consumption was also reduced by more than 400 tons compared to February. Many workers have also improved their work attitudes. Worker Yu Hai has voluntarily worked overtime for 64 hours since March. Currently, in addition to ensuring the completion of the production meritorious service plan for April, the factory workers are determined to study the self-manufacture of electricity meters. All employees of the First and Second Paper Mills have been working 11 hours a day recently, and production has exceeded the planned target. The Northeast First Woolen Mill has increased its output by 17 times since reorganizing and improving its work in October last year until March this year. Previously, the ratio of raw material to manufacturing cost was 1:1, but now it is 1:0.3. The cotton spinning department of the Northeast Textile Bureau exceeded the original plan by 617 bolts in March, and the quality has also improved compared to the past. The factory now plans to strive to complete a plan to increase production by about double the March plan before "May 1st." In the spinning department of the Yumin Textile Factory, female workers used to be able to watch 60 ends each, but now many female workers can watch 100 ends each. The female workers in the preparation department reel more than 7 catties of yarn per day, and Jing Suolan even reached 12 catties and 3 taels. In another textile factory, all workers increased total output by 20% and saved 12% of raw materials in the past half month. For example, in the cotton batting department, one machine could only supply 10 carding machines in the past, but now it can supply 30. A certain railway construction project of the West Manchuria Railway Bureau created a record of building 7 kilometers a day in the workers' competition. The First Mine of a certain mining area plans to complete the production task of 4,000 tons of coal per day. Workers in the Second Mining Area have exceeded the task by one-seventh in the first quarter. Miner Wang Fengcai averages more than 0.8 tons of coal per day. Workers at the Harbin Tram Factory began a crash overtime work in mid-March and will complete the plan to increase 30 trams before May Day. Public bus workers plan to renovate all vehicles and have now completed 40. Workers at the water plant announced that they would complete the electrical water purification equipment before May 10. Workers in some areas have proposed to complete the work of two people with one person. Factories also challenge each other, and production enthusiasm is very high. Also reported: Workers from public and private enterprises in Harbin, Qiqihar, and Mudanjiang are actively electing representatives to participate in the workers' congresses to be held in various places on "May 1st." Representatives from many public and private enterprises in Harbin have been elected, and many labor heroes and mental workers have been elected.
