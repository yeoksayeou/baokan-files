　　Masses in Four Counties Along the River Strive to Save Themselves
　　Changyuan Embankment is Rebuilt
　　Chiang Kai-shek Gangsters Frantically Oppose the People
	Continuously Harass Embankment Repair Workers
　　[This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 18th dispatch] Shattering the Chiang Kai-shek bandit’s conspiracy to breach the embankment, the important project of the South Tou Changyuan Embankment on the north bank of the Yellow River, under the command of the Second Repair and Defense Office, has been rushed to completion. We had previously rushed to repair this section of the embankment last year, but due to the disturbances and sabotage by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits at that time, it was not completed. In addition, in order to flood our people on the north bank, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had dug countless deep trenches on the embankment. This year, our democratic government, in order to resolutely repair this important project, mobilized more than 14,000 people from the four counties of Changyuan, Huaxian, Weinan, and Quhe to rebuild it. Due to the active efforts of the masses who repaired the embankment to save themselves, the repairs were wide, high (8 meters wide at the top, more than 4.8 zhang high), and solid. By the 6th of this month, in just half a month, the rush repairs were completed, totaling 50 li in length. During this embankment repair, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits sent small groups of armed secret agents to shoot and create disturbances, but under the cover of our troops, the embankment repair was not affected in any way. We will now begin repairing the Guanmeng Embankment, which was destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits last year.
　　[This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 18th dispatch] In order to grasp the water situation in the upper reaches of the Yellow River so as to prepare in advance for the downstream during the major flood season and avoid being caught unprepared when the major flood arrives downstream, the Yellow River Commission has decided to establish a hydrological station in the Pinglu area of the Taiyue District, with Comrade Zhang Huiseng as the station chief. Currently, Station Chief Zhang and his party of more than 20 people have set off for Pinglu on the 16th, carrying hydrological instruments.
　　[This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 18th dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes bombed and killed or wounded more than 50 of our people crossing the river. On the 9th, when merchants in our district were crossing the river at the Shangquetou ferry in the Dong'a section, Chiang Kai-shek planes suddenly attacked, indiscriminately strafing and bombing, killing and wounding more than 20 merchants. The masses on the south bank of the Yellow River, who had fled to the north of the river to escape the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, were returning home to harvest wheat because the wheat was about to ripen, but when crossing the river at Liuzhuang, just after getting on the boat, Chiang Kai-shek planes flew in to bomb and strafe, killing and wounding more than 30 people crossing the river. The Chen Liangji and Chen Geyi families in the Fourth District of Juancheng suffered misfortune, with Chen Geyi being killed and his wife seriously injured, leaving only their three-year-old and six-month-old children, crying incessantly. Another young girl of eighteen or nineteen was bombed into three pieces, a tragic sight.
　　[This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 18th dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek bandits continue to destroy our dangerous works on the Yellow River and strafe our embankment repair workers. The 81st Brigade (Brigade Commander Ge Kaixiang) of the 68th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army and some local bandits from Magao Village robbed 20,000 jin of straw materials that we had stored at the Gaozhuang Dam on the Dongming Daxian Engineering Project. The new Sanba Dam at the Lijinzhuang Dangerous Engineering Project is being directly impacted by a strong current, and the dam foundation is collapsing severely, creating a dangerous situation, also due to the obstruction and sabotage by the bandit army, preventing us from rushing to repair it. We had a boat stored in Laojuntang for transporting materials for new construction, which was burned by the 422nd Regiment of the 81st Brigade of the bandit army on April 20th. On the same day, the bandit army was stationed in the three villages of Liulou, Huanggu, and Zhangzhuang, and on the 21st, they burned more than 4,000 jin of willow branches that we had stored in the west of Liuzhuang. A regiment of the 55th Division of the bandit army was stationed in Linpuji to build an encirclement, and a battalion of the regiment was stationed in Caozhuang, three li south of the Jiangsu Dam, with a platoon patrolling the dam every day, and a pillbox was built on the Laoer Dam, and the stakes on the dam were robbed. All 210,000 jin of straw materials that we stored in Juntun (north of Jiangkou) were also looted. On the 12th, our civilian boats transporting stones to Wangpin Mountain were attacked by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and one sailor was shot and injured. At 2:00 PM on May 9th, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit plane bombed Hongmiao on the @Mountain Dangerous Engineering Project, injuring two civilian workers from Nanwang County who were transporting straw materials. On the same day, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit plane destroyed two boats belonging to our First Repair and Defense Office that were transporting materials south of Zhaizhuang in Kunwu. On the 10th, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit plane flew south along the river and discovered the masses transporting stone materials in Shanshan in Xuyi County (a newly established county, formed from the northeastern part of Yanggu and the western part of Dong'a), and immediately strafed wildly, injuring Xing Jiga and Xing Jigui, civilian workers from Xingzhuang in the First District, and Xu Haode from Dongchenji. The masses along the river are extremely angry at this kind of crazy action by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

　　沿河四县群众奋力自救
  　长垣大堤重修完毕
  　蒋匪疯狂与民为敌 
    不断袭扰修堤员工
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】粉碎蒋匪破堤阴谋，二修防处所指挥之黄河北岸南头长垣大堤重要工程，已抢修完毕。这一段大堤，于去年我们曾经抢修过，但因当时蒋匪的扰乱与破坏，未能修竣。另外蒋匪为了要放水淹我北岸人民，曾在大堤上挖掘无数深沟。今年我民主政府为了坚决修好这一段重要工程，就动员了长垣、滑县、卫南、曲河四县群众一万四千余人重修。由于修堤自救的群众积极努力，所以修的又宽又高（顶宽的八公尺，高四八尺多）又结实。至本月六日，仅半个月时间，已抢修完毕，共长五十里。这次的修堤中，蒋匪曾经派来小股武装特务打枪扰乱，但在我部队掩护之下，修堤未受任何影响。现在我将开始修复去年蒋匪所破坏的贯孟堤。
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】黄委会为了掌握黄河上游的水势情况，以便到大泛期下游及时预做准备，避免大水来到下游后防御不及；特决定到太岳区平陆一带设立水文站，以张慧僧同志为站长。现张站长等一行二十余人，已携带水文仪器于十六日启程前往平陆。
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】蒋匪飞机又炸死炸伤我渡河群众五十余名。九日，我区商民正在东阿段上确头渡口渡河，蒋机突来袭击，肆无忌惮的扫射轰炸，商人死伤二十余名。黄河南岸群众因躲避蒋匪暴行逃到河北来，近因麦子将熟而要回家收麦，但在刘庄渡河时，刚刚上船之后，蒋机飞来轰炸扫射，渡河群众死伤三十余名。鄄城四区陈良集、陈阁义全家四人遭难，陈阁义被打死，其妻受重伤，现只剩其三岁与六个月的小孩，叫哭连天。另一个十八九岁的幼女被炸成三段，惨不忍睹。
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】蒋匪继续破坏我黄河险工，扫射我修堤员工。蒋匪军六十八师八一旅（旅长葛开祥）和马高村的一部分土蒋，将我存于东明大险工高庄坝上的二万斤秸料抢走。李进庄险工大流直冲新三坝，坝基坍塌的很厉害，险象环生，也因匪军的阻扰破坏，致我不能抢修。老君堂存有我们新造运工料的船一只，于四月二十日被匪军八一旅四二二团烧毁了。当天该匪军住在刘楼、皇姑、张庄三个村，至二十一日又将我存在刘庄西头的四千余斤柳把子烧了。匪军五五师的一个团驻于临濮集筑围剿，该团的一个营住江苏坝南三里的曹庄，有一个排每天到坝上巡逻，并在老二坝上筑了一个碉堡，抢走了坝上的桩，我们存在军屯（在姜口北）的二十一万斤秸料，也全部被抢光了。十二日，我往望品山运石的民船被蒋匪袭击，水手被射伤一名。五月九日下午二时，匪飞机一架在＠山险工的红庙轰炸，炸伤南旺县运秸料的民工二人。同日，匪机一架在昆吾翟庄南将我一修防处运工料的两只船射毁。十日，匪机一架沿河往南飞，在徐翼县（新设县，由阳谷的东北部及东阿的西部划成）的苫山发现我运石料的群众，即疯狂扫射，打伤一区邢庄运石民工邢继高和邢继贵、东陈集徐好德等三人。对蒋匪此种疯狂行动，沿河群众异常愤恨。
