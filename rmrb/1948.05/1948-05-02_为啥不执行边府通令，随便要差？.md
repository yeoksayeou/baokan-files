Title: Why Not Enforce the Border Region Government Order, Issuing Arbitrary Requests for Labor?

To the Editorial Comrade:

　　The People's Daily published a joint order from the Border Region Government and Military Region on April 20th, stating: During the spring plowing season, the use of civilian labor should be restricted. Except for stretchers and civilian laborers necessary for combat, and the transportation of firearms and ammunition to the front lines, all other labor levies should be stopped. It also stated that the transport of wounded soldiers and disabled veterans along the way should minimize the use of civilian labor. These regulations show great concern for the masses' spring plowing! However, today, two young men came with a labor requisition slip issued by the Peace Hospital (Bai Shaan, unclear), with no name on it. When asked what work they had to do at the hospital, they said it was to visit someone. I explained the Border Region Government's order, emphasizing that the masses are very busy with spring plowing and that labor cannot be arbitrarily dispatched, and insisted they leave. They replied with an attitude, saying: "Isn't this a procedure from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Hospital?" and left angrily. I think that since the Border Region Government and Military Region have issued an order, which was clearly published in the newspaper, why is the Peace Hospital still issuing labor requisition slips for people who are visiting others? I hope the Peace Hospital will investigate.

　　为啥不执行边府通令，随便要差？编辑同志：
    四月二十日人民日报登载边府军区联合通令上说：春耕期间限制动用民力，除作战必要用之担架民工、及供应前方的枪械弹药等可运外，其他支差一律停止。又说沿途转送军队之伤兵人员，及不能行走之荣誉军人，均应尽量节省民力。以上这些规定，对群众春耕多么关心！但本日即有两个青壮年，拿着和平医院（白啥恩，没看清）开的差条要差，上边也没名字。问他上医院有啥工作？他说是看望人的。我就把边府通令给他解释，现在群众春耕很忙，不能随便派差，坚持点走吧。他很起态度的说：我这不是晋冀鲁豫边区医院手续吗？很生气的走了。我想既边府军区有通令，报上登的很明白，为啥和平医院还给看望的人开差条呢？希和平医院检查。
