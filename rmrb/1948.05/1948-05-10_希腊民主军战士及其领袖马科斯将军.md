Greek Democratic Army Soldiers and Their Leader General Markos

I.

Smernov

When the Security Council's Border Investigation Committee was working in Greece, several members wanted to meet General Markos, the Supreme Commander of the Greek Democratic Army. The representatives of the United States and Britain categorically opposed such a meeting - because it was not in line with their countries' policies. However, at the insistence of many representatives, the meeting was finally achieved. This was in the village of Kastanofite in the liberated area of ​​Greece, and the official representatives of the United States and Britain did not participate.

In the land of free Greece, the committee members and the reporters who accompanied them (including British and American reporters) were surprised by many things: the discipline, training, and appearance of the Democratic Army, and mainly the heroism of the soldiers and officers. It was not difficult to guess that all this was very unpleasant for some foreign reporters. But they still put on smiles and listened to the details of the lives of the Democratic Army leaders. Sometimes they even wanted to make fun - but ended up being embarrassed.

When the reporters were left in a room designated for them, fifteen-year-old guerrilla fighter Adanas Klimas brought them water and cups. Everyone chatted with him. Only then did they learn that this little guy was a Macedonian, had been fighting for two years, and the main reason he became a guerrilla fighter was the murder of his brother.

"Who killed your brother?" asked Miss Shuklis, an American reporter.

The fifteen-year-old guerrilla replied seriously:

"The King and Churchill."

This reply caused loud, but unnatural laughter from the British and American reporters.

Reporter Walter began to tease him, saying:

"Did the King kill him himself? Well, yes. Churchill probably helped hold the candle."

But the child seemed smarter and saw further than Walter, and his dignified reply was like a slap in the face:

"The King, his protectors and his servants are all the same... I think the person who gives the orders should bear the main responsibility for the murder."

A slender Democratic Army officer walked into the reporters' room and interjected: "The King's servants killed this child's brother in the summer of 1945. Why? Because he resisted the Germans. The Greek authorities even considered this a criminal act when the Soviet army entered Berlin."

The officer identified himself as George Yanulis, the commander of the Democratic Army. The reporters had heard in the city of Solena that the royalist government was offering a high reward for the head of this officer, so they asked him to report a little about his own history. He was thirty-one years old and a graduate of the Faculty of Law of the University of Athens. He had been in military service since 1939. He was wounded while fighting the Italians on the Albanian front and had been commended twice. Before the end of the war, he joined the ranks of the People's Liberation Army, but on February 23, 1945, according to the Varkiza Agreement, like all his comrades, he handed over his weapons.

"What did you do during the year from the signing of the Varkiza Agreement to the resumption of the war?" Walter asked.

"I was hiding," Yanulis replied. "Not many days after the Varkiza Agreement was signed, British officers began arresting soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. But I had to hide immediately after a German security battalion non-commissioned officer was killed. Before 1944, this person wore a German uniform, received German allowances, and attacked us under German command. In September 1944, I personally disarmed him, but let him go. I thought he, an ordinary farmer, would know his mistake and correct it. Who knew that in March 1945 he reappeared in the city of Kosana where I was at the time. Seraphim - that villain's name - wore a new British uniform, and the military post the Germans gave him was still retained.

On the way to here, they had to pass through the village of Amodar, which had been burned three times: under the Italians, under the Germans, and under the British, and this Seraphim participated each time.

The fascists later boasted in a hotel in Kosana that they burned down the village of Amodar as revenge. These traitors of the people were all wearing British uniforms. The National Guard brought back the head of Thomas Zimunulis from the burned-down village of Amodar. The murderers had gouged out his eyes and tortured him for a long time. This happened on April 24, 1945. At that time, the Russians were fighting in the streets of Berlin, and the British decided to start large-scale massacres of anti-fascists in Greece. These crimes of massacre were completed with the help of traitors. There was no one else to choose. Who else could do this kind of thing?

Seraphim was later sentenced to death by the Greek guerrillas. At the end of August 1945, I had to flee the city of Kosana because the person who was hiding me was arrested in the street. I got this news only a few minutes before the military police arrived.

I ran to Gramos. The local farmers knew me when they were resisting the German occupying forces. Several villages where I hid there are still free today. From September 1945 to before the March 1946 elections, I also lived here, in the village of Kastanofite, at the home of Pannasdasia."

"When and from whom did you receive the order to organize the troops?" Walter asked. "You, from all appearances, are a Communist, and Communists are disciplined people who do everything according to the decisions and consent of higher party organizations."

"Who told you I was a Communist?" Yanulis felt strange. "If you ask me if I agree with the party's program, then I will answer: yes, I do. But the question is not whether I am a Communist, although it is not bad to be a thorough democrat and patriot like a Communist. Now I will answer your main question. I started resisting the royalist government purely for self-defense, suddenly, without any orders. One evening, military police scouts stopped me and two companions on the road. We were taken into custody, but we were unarmed. What to do? Wait for orders? No! I grabbed the military policeman's collar, and my companions dealt with the other two in the same way, each disarming a military policeman, so we had two rifles, a machine gun, a rifle, and four hand grenades. This was the beginning of organizing the guerrillas.

"In the initial battles of our troops, more than half of the soldiers used shovels and pitchforks as weapons. Now our army is dressed and armed with everything necessary... We seized arms, like other guerrillas, in battle, from the enemy."

Foreign reporters also "enthusiastically" interrogated Yanulis for a long time. Walter was particularly enthusiastic, he wanted to convince everyone that the leaders of the Democratic Army came from foreign countries and acted according to someone's orders, not Greek patriots who defended the interests of their motherland. But Yanulis effortlessly exposed Walter's attempt.

Soon General Markos arrived, a young, strong-willed, and talented commander-in-chief of the Greek Democratic Army.

Markos declared to the reporters:

"I feel that democratic countries have great sympathy for the struggle waged by the Greek people. I firmly believe in our victory, because a people who fight so enthusiastically, heroically, and intelligently for their independence are invincible. I also derive this firm belief from the glorious past and present of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and other freedom-loving nations, because they have also walked this path..."

Kalvonidie

"........This is somewhere in Macedonia, a wild mountain range. Green and crimson rocks crack into deep, black canyons at the top of the mountain. I walked along the path in the canyon, and the yellow and cold stream flowed gurgling under my feet. Suddenly, behind the corner, a stone square unfolded, and a path led to an old gray house. More than a hundred people were sitting in front of the house, cross-legged, with pistols, machine guns, and automatic guns tucked behind their backs. Everything happened quickly. A sentry, looking at my left shoulder (where the tricolor epaulette shimmered), asked me: 'French?' I replied: 'Yes.' He grabbed my hand and squeezed it painfully, shouting: 'Long live France!' The guerrillas all jumped up, and a huge roar came from the chests of Greek patriots: 'Long live free and democratic France!' The sentry suddenly let go of my hand, straightened up, and stood at attention, and more than a hundred guerrilla fighters excitedly and enthusiastically sang 'La Marseillaise.' At this time, I realized that I was in tears..."

A French reporter who had been to free Greece described his meeting with the Greek guerrillas in this way in a book about the Greek Democratic Army published in Paris. The Greek Democratic Army was established a year ago, on October 28, 1946.

The noble goals and heroic spirit of the Democratic Army have been recognized worldwide. Articles evaluating the outstanding qualities of this people's liberation army have increasingly appeared in publications around the world. British reporter Balfour wrote in January this year: "We arrived in free Greece and entered the Vitz Mountains, where 20,000 farmers live under the banner of the Democratic Army. I was one of the first Britons to visit this army, whose slogan is: 'Please, British, go home.' The high morale, exemplary military training, and guerrilla discipline greatly surprised us. The guerrillas are well-dressed and well-armed. In Trosobi, I saw three hundred guerrilla fighters out of a population of seven hundred."

General Markos, the commander-in-chief of the Democratic Army, enjoys great respect and love among the Greek people.

He was born in Asia Minor in 1906. Due to the early death of his parents, he had to work from the age of eleven (first as a stonemason, then as an agricultural worker) to support himself and his several younger siblings. In 1924, he, along with all the Greek residents expelled from Asia Minor by the Turks, fled back to Greece. In the same year, Markos joined the Communist Youth League. Markos worked in tobacco factories in Kavar and Macedonia. In 1926, he was called into the army and served as a cavalry sergeant. From this time on, he began to pay special attention to military art, hoping to use it to serve the people.

After demobilization, he became an activist in trade unions and democratic organizations, and was constantly pursued by the Greek domestic police system after World War I.

From 1934, Markos, as a Communist, carried out huge and unyielding work among the masses. During the ten years from 1927 to 1938, Markos lived in a cycle of prisons, escapes, and underground work. In 1938, the fascist dictator General Metaxas exiled him to the desolate island of Odes (southern end of Crete), known for its harsh climate. Here he encountered the war. When Mussolini attacked Greece, he and the rest of the "democratic prisoners" requested to be sent to the front. The dictator Metaxas rejected Markos's request. It was not until after Greece was occupied by the Germans that Markos escaped from the island of Odes. He participated as one of the organizers of national liberation.

From 1941, Markos fought in the guerrillas. He became a famous commander of the Democratic Army. The Greek fascist authorities announced that whoever killed General Markos would be rewarded with 20 million drachmas.

A French reporter described Markos's image in this way: "I had already seen photos of General Markos in democratic newspapers in Athens, but I never thought I would meet this young, energetic, and emotional person. Although he says he is forty-one years old, I don't think he is over thirty-five. Unlike most Greeks of the same age, there is not a single white hair in his deep chestnut hair. Deep blue eyes, thick Greek-style beard - this is Markos's face. On the day of our first meeting, he was wearing a tan Greek military uniform, without any special markings or epaulettes, a pistol tucked into his waist, binoculars hanging on his belt, riding breeches, and brown leather boots." Regarding the tasks of the Democratic Army, Markos replied: "The Democratic Army is fighting for Greek independence and to give freedom to the people. It firmly resists foreign occupation. It does not recognize any foreign interference. It will make the Greek people masters of their own country and able to freely choose a political system according to their wishes."

Under the banner of the Greek Democratic Army, the sons and daughters of the people are united; they were not destroyed by the German and Italian aggressors, and they will not be defeated by the fascist royalists supported by British and American imperialism.

　　希腊民主军战士及其领袖马科斯将军
    一
    斯梅良诺夫
    安全理事会的边境调查委员会在希腊工作的时候，有几位委员希望会见马科斯将军，希腊民主军的最高总司令。美国和英国的代表断然反对这种会见——因为这不合乎他们国家的政策。然而在许多代表的坚持下，终于达到了会见的目的。这是在希腊解放区的卡斯丹诺菲特村里，美国和英国的正式代表没有参加。
    在自由希腊的土地上，委员会的委员们和伴随他们来的记者们（包括英美记者）对许多事情都感到惊奇：民主军的纪律，训练和外形，而主要是兵士和军官们的那种英雄气概，不难猜想到，这一切对于某些外国记者是很不愉快的。但他们仍旧装出笑容，倾听民主军的领袖们的生活详情。有时他们甚至想取笑——但结果只落得没趣。
    当记者们留在一间指定给他们的屋子里时，十五岁的游击队员阿丹纳斯·克里玛斯给他们送来了水和杯子。大家跟他聊起天来。才知道，这小家伙是马其顿人，已经打了两年仗，而使他成为游击队员的主要原因，就是他哥哥的被杀。
    “谁杀死了你的哥哥？”美国女记者淑克利丝小姐问道。
    十五岁的游击队员一本正经的回答：
    “国王和邱吉尔。”
    这答话引起了英美记者的高声的，但不很自然的大笑。
    记者华尔特开始嬉弄他道：
    “国王亲手杀死他吗？嗯，是的。邱吉尔大概帮忙拿蜡烛吧。”
    但是孩子显得比华尔特更聪明，看得更远，他那充满威严的回答，仿佛是一记巴掌：
    “国王，他的保护人和他的仆奴们都是一样的东西……我想，应负凶杀主要责任的，是那指挥的人。”
    一位身材瘦长的民主军军官，走进了记者们的房间，他插口道：“国王的仆奴们在一九四五年夏天杀死了这孩子的哥哥。为什么？因为他反抗德国人。希腊当局甚至在苏军攻进柏林时，还认为这是犯罪的行为。”
    军官自称是乔治斯·雅努里斯，民主军的指挥官。记者们在索伦那城听说过，保皇政府正悬重赏寻求这位军官的首级，于是请他报告一点关于他自己的历史。他卅一岁，雅典大学法科毕业。自一九三九年起开始服军役。曾在阿尔巴尼亚前线对意大利人作战时受伤，并曾两度获得嘉奖。战争结束前，加入人民解放军的队伍，但一九四五年二月二十三日，按照伐尔基斯协定，象所有其他同志们一样，他交出了武器。
    “从签订伐尔基斯协定，到重新开始战争，这一年间你做什么事呢？”华尔特问道。
    “我躲藏着。”雅努里斯回答，“伐尔基斯协定签字后，没有几天，英国军官就开始逮捕人民解放军的战士了。但我是在一个德国保安营的下士被杀之后，才不得不立刻隐藏起来的。一九四四年以前，此人穿着德国军服，拿德国人的津贴，在德国人指挥下攻击我们。一九四四年九月，我亲自解除了他的武装，但放了他，我想，他，一个普通农民，会知道自己的错误，而改邪归正的。那知一九四五年三月他又出现于我当时所在的科萨纳城里。绥拉菲姆——这坏蛋的名字——身上穿了新的英国制服，而德国人给他的军职，仍原封不动地保留着。
    在到这里来的路上，他们要经过一个阿摩达尔村，这村子被焚烧过三次：在意大利人手下，德国人手下和英国人手下，而每次都有这位绥拉菲姆参加。
    法西斯党徒后来在科萨纳的酒店里自夸道，他们烧毁阿摩达尔村，是为了复仇。这些人民的叛徒全穿着英军制服。国民近卫军从焚毁的阿摩达尔村带来了托玛斯·齐摩努里斯的头颅。凶手们曾活活挖去他的眼睛，拷打了好久。这是一九四五年四月二十四日的事。当时俄国人正在柏林的市街上作战，而英国人就决定在希腊开始大规模的屠杀反法西斯分子。这些屠杀的罪行，他们是借叛徒们之助而完成的。没有别的人可以挑选。还有谁能干这种事？
    绥拉菲姆后来被希腊游击队判处了死刑。一九四五年八月底我不得不逃出科萨纳城，因为隐藏我的人，在街上被捕了。我得到这个消息，仅仅是在宪兵来临前的几分钟。
    我跑到格拉摩斯去了。当地的农民还在抵抗德国占领军的时候就认得我。有几个我在那儿躲藏过的村子，至今还是自由的。自一九四五年九月至一九四六年三月选举前，我也住在这里，卡斯丹诺菲特村，在潘纳斯达西亚的家里。
    “什么时候并且从什么手里你接到组织队伍的命令？”华尔特问道，“你，从各方面看来，是一个共产党员，而共产党员都是服从纪律的人，无论做什么事都要得到上级党机构的决定和同意的。”
    “谁跟你说过，我是共产党员？”雅努里斯感到奇怪。“如果你问我同意不同意该党的纲领，那我将回答：是的，同意的。但问题不在于我是否共产党员，虽然做一个象共产党员那样彻底民主主义者和爱国者也不坏。现在我回答你的主要问题。我开始反抗保皇党政府是单纯为了自卫，是突然的，没有任何命令的。一天傍晚，我和两个同伴在大路上被宪兵斥候喝停了。我们被押了起来，但我们是没有武装的。怎么办呢？等候命令吗？不！我抓住了宪兵的衣领，而我的同伴们也以同样的方法对付另外两个，每人解除了一个宪兵的武装，于是我们有了两枝步枪，一枝自动枪，一枝来福枪，还有四颗手榴弹。这也就是组织游击队的开始。
    “我们的队伍在最初战斗时，一半以上战士都以铲钗为武器。现在我们的军队已穿戴着和武装着一切必需品了……武装，象其它游击队一样，我们是在战斗中，从敌人手中夺来的。”
    外国记者还“热情地”审问了雅努里斯很久。特别热心的是华尔特，他想使所有的人相信，民主军的领袖是从外国来的，并且是按照什么人的命令行动的，而不是保卫祖国利益的希腊爱国者。但雅努里斯毫不费力地暴露了华尔特的企图。
    不久马科斯将军来了，他是一位年青的，意志力很强的，天才的希腊民主军总司令。
    马科斯向记者们宣称：
    “我感觉到，民主国家对于希腊人民所进行的斗争都抱着巨大的同情。我坚信我们的胜利，因为如此热情，英勇和聪明地为自己的独立而斗争的人民是无敌的。我也从苏维埃、南斯拉夫和其他爱好自由民族的光荣的过去和现在得到了这种坚信，因为它们也走过这条道路的……”

    “………这是在马其顿尼亚某地，蛮荒的山岭。绿色和赤色的岩石在山顶上裂成深遂的，乌黑的峡谷。我沿着峡谷的小路走去，脚底下黄色的而寒冷的溪水潺潺流着。突然在转角的后面展开了一片石子的广场，和一条通在古老的灰色屋子的小路。屋前坐着百多人，他们盘着腿，在背擦手枪、机关枪和自动枪。一切都飞快地发生了。一个哨兵，眼睛瞧着我的左肩（那里闪烁着三色的肩章），问我：‘法国人？’我答：‘是的。’他抓起我的手，捏得我发痛，一面喊道：‘法兰西万岁！’游击队员们都跳了起来，从希腊爱国者的胸膛里发出了巨吼：‘自由民主的法兰西万岁！’哨兵突然放松了我的手，挺一挺身，立正了，一百多个游击战士兴奋地热情的唱起‘马赛曲’来。这时我发觉我流泪了……”
    一位到过自由希腊的法国记者，在巴黎出版的关于希腊民主军的书中，这样描写了他和希腊游击队会见的情形。一年前，一九四六年十月二十八日成立了希腊民主军。
    民主军的崇高目标和英勇精神已获得全世界的公认。在世界各国的出版物上日益增多地出现了评价这支人民解放军的卓越品质的文章，英国记者巴尔勃在今年一月间写道：“我们到了自由希腊，进入维茨山脉，那里有二万农民生活在民主军的旗帜下。我是第一批访问这支军队的英国人，它的口号是：‘请英国人回家’。崇高的道德，模范的军事训练和游击队的纪律，使我们大为惊奇。游击队员都穿得很好，武装也不坏。在特洛索比，我看到居民七百人中，有三百个游击队员。”
    民主军的总司令马科斯将军，在希腊人民间获得极大的尊敬和爱护。
    他在一九○六年生于小亚细亚。由于父母早亡，他从十一岁起就不得不工作（先作石匠，后来作农业工人），以养活自己和几个弟弟。一九二四年他和所有的被土耳其人逐出小亚细亚的希腊居民一同逃回希腊。同年马科斯参加了共青团。马科斯曾在卡华尔和马其顿的烟草工厂里工作。一九二六年他被召入伍，任骑兵中士。从这时起，他开始特别注意军事艺术，希望用来为人民服务。
    复员后，他成为职工会和民主组织的活动人物，而遭受到第一次世界大战后希腊国内警察制度的经常追逐。
    自一九三四年起，马科斯，作为一个共产党员，在群众中进行了巨大的，不屈不挠的工作。在一九二七年到一九三八年的十年间，马科斯生活于监牢，逃亡和地下工作的循环中。一九三八年，法西斯独裁者梅达克萨斯将军把他流放到荒凉的，以恶劣气候著名的奥德斯岛上（克里特岛南端）。这里他遇到了战争。当莫索里尼进攻希腊的时候，他和其余的“民主犯”一同要求把他们派到前线去。独裁者梅达克萨斯拒绝了马科斯的请求。直到希腊被德国人占领以后，马科斯才从奥德斯岛上逃出来。他参加了民族解放的组织者之一。
    从一九四一年，马科斯在游击队里作战。他成了民主军的一位著名统帅，希腊法西斯当局曾宣布，谁杀死马科斯将军，就奖以两千万希币。
    一位法国记者这样描绘马科斯的形象道：“我在雅典的民主报纸上已经看见过马科斯将军的照相，但我从没有想到，我将会见这一年青的、生气勃勃的和感情丰富的人。虽然他说，他有四十一岁，但我看不过卅五岁。和大多数相等年纪的希腊人不同，在他的深粟色的头发中，没有一根白发。深蓝的眼睛，浓密的希腊式胡子——这就是马科斯的面貌。在我们初次会见的那天，他穿着黄褐色的希腊军服，没有任何特别的标记，或襟章，腰上插一支手枪，皮带上挂着望远镜，下身穿着骑兵裤，和褐色的皮靴。”对于民主军的任务问题，马科斯答道：“民主军为希腊独立而战，并且要给人民以自由。它坚决抵抗外国的占领。它不承认任何外国的干涉。它将使希腊人民成为自己国家的主人，并且能够按照他们的愿望，来自由选择政治制度。”
    在希腊民主军的旗帜下，人民的儿女团结起来了；他们没有被德意侵略者摧残，而他们也不会被英美帝国主义所支持的法西斯保皇党徒击败。（何歌译）——时代二三九期。
