　　Nanfeng Corrects Loan Bias
  　Many Middle Peasants Receive Relief
    [Ji Lu Yu News] Nanfeng Fifth District paid attention to correcting biases and following the mass line in disaster relief loans. At the beginning of April, a meeting of district cadres was held, which first reviewed the mistakes in past loans. In the past, the purpose of loans was not clearly to solve the difficulties of poor people and develop sideline occupations. Some comrades had a lending-money-for-profit viewpoint, so they did not consider how to solve the difficulties of the masses and develop rural sideline occupations, but rather who could afford to repay the loan. Last winter, most of the loans went to the village cadres. For example, the Lijiazhuang Cooperative (run by village cadres and model team members with the fruits of struggle) received 600,000 yuan at once. The Qiaofosi Cooperative, like Lijiazhuang, received 200,000 yuan. The village of Jianchang received a total of 225,000 yuan, of which 195,000 yuan was taken by the village cadres. There were also village cadres who borrowed 100,000 to 80,000 yuan in the name of mutual aid teams. After reviewing and recognizing the mistakes in past work, the old loans were re-examined, and a total of 1.41 million yuan of unreasonable loans from last year were recovered. However, in the process of recovering old loans, there was a left-leaning problem. Loans from individual middle peasants who should not have been recovered were forcibly recovered, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the middle peasants. The poor peasants were also afraid to borrow money because of the impact of this forced recovery of old loans, fearing that they would not be able to pay when the money was collected. They said, "It is difficult to deal with the higher authorities; they give when they say they will give, and they want it back when they say they will want it back." This matter has attracted the attention of the work, and cadres in the whole district have been assigned to correct the mistakes in the recovery of old loans. Based on the review of the past, the loan policy for the future was determined. The loan focus is mainly on the flood-affected areas, 18 villages along the Tuhai River, especially 10 flood-affected villages such as Lihai and Xindianji, with a total of 105 households receiving loans, totaling 2.368 million yuan. Among them, 14 middle-peasant households received 430,000 yuan, and 91 poor-peasant households received 1.938 million yuan. Secondly, the poor villages that were not flooded were also taken care of. This loan was mostly given to those who needed money, and many middle peasants also received relief, especially the middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, such as Zhang Yitun. They felt that our policy had indeed changed, which greatly stabilized their production morale.

　　南峰纠正贷款偏向
  　好多中农得到救济
    【冀鲁豫消息】南峰五区在救灾贷款中，注意纠正偏向走群众路线。四月初召开区干部会，首先检讨了过去贷款中的错误。过去贷款中没有明确解决贫苦群众困难、发展副业的目的，有些同志存在着放债观点，所以不是考虑如何解决群众困难，发展农村副业，而是考虑谁能还得起就贷给谁。去年冬大部分都贷到村干手里，象李家庄合作社（村干和模范班一二十人用斗争果实办的），一下就贷了六十万。袷佛寺合作社，和李家庄一样，贷了二十万。减场村共贷二十二万五千元，村干就占十九万五千元。还有村干部以互助组名义，一个人就贷十万八万的。经检查认识了过去工作中的错误，并重新审查了过去的旧贷款，会后收回去年不合理的贷款共一百四十一万元。但在收回旧贷中，又发生了左倾毛病，把个别不该收回的中农的贷款，立逼着也收了，引起了中农不满；贫农也因为这种逼收旧贷的影响，怕收款时缴不了而不敢借贷。他们说：“上级的事不好办，说给就给说要就要。”此事已引起工作上的注意，布置全区干部补正收回旧贷中的错误。根据对过去的检讨，确定了今后贷款方针，贷款重点主要是水淹区，沿徒骇河一带十八个村庄，其中又以栗海、辛店集等十个水淹村，共贷下去一○五户，款二百卅六万八千元。其中中农十四户，贷了四十三万元；贫农九十一户，贷了一百九十三万八千元。其次也照顾了未被水淹的穷庄。这次贷款，多贷到需要用钱的人手里，好多中农也得到救济，特别是斗错的中农，象张乙屯他们感到我们的政策确实变了，对他们的生产情绪是很大的稳定。
