　　Merchants in Zhangli Gather Clarify Situation
  　Repair Storefronts and Open for Business
    [Report from this newspaper] Zhangli Gathering in the Third District of Linzhang is a market town with more than 500 households. There are 213 merchants with business licenses (excluding transactions with capital under 40,000 yuan). Due to past neglect of industrial and commercial policies, commerce suffered some losses during last year's mass movement. Until the middle of the second lunar month, merchants were still not at ease doing business, merely maintaining appearances, and even considering closing down. Wang Jienian's general store was often closed, and he didn't open it even on market days. Storefront properties on the main street were vacant, with no one renting them. The merchants' common concerns were: (1) Lack of understanding of the Land Law, preferring to wait until they understood it. They were afraid to open their doors without agricultural association shares, village cadre shares, or mass cooperative shares. Wang Quan Yin's general store demanded that the village cadres calculate shares before daring to open. The village cadres explained the protection of industry and commerce, but he still said: "If you don't calculate shares, I won't open my door!" Those engaged in business feared being labeled as having too much wealth and preferred to reduce their activities to minimize attention. Some steamed bun shops, yeast shops, and noodle shops were too busy to manage themselves but dared not hire people, fearing being accused of exploitation. (2) Another reason was the complaint that the business tax levied last year was too high, fearing they wouldn't make a profit and still have to pay. Subsequently, a merchants' meeting was convened, emphasizing the protection of industry and commerce, and declaring that if industry and commerce were harmed again in the future, everyone had the right to appeal to the government. It was also announced that the losses of industry and commerce last year would be discussed and compensated by the masses. Afterward, group meetings were held, and individual concerns were addressed, dispelling all the merchants' worries. Some said, "If this meeting had been held a few days earlier, how great would that have been!" They all regretted wasting their business opportunities and losing money. On the same day, two or three households sought landlords to rent storefronts. Now all the storefronts in the town have been rented, and various businesses are actively repairing their storefronts. Wang Jie, who was most afraid of struggle, also opened his general store. Wang Jichun, the owner of the noodle shop, said, "Last year I dared not hire anyone to grind noodles, I don't know how much money I lost!" He has now hired noodle grinding workers. Merchants seeing the report that the Border Region Government had ordered the abolition of the road permit system all said, "The government really takes care of merchants!"

　　章里集商人摸清底
  　修补门面开张营业
    【本报消息】临漳三区章里集，是五百多户的集镇，有营业证商人二百十三户（四万元以下资本的买卖不算）。因为过去忽视了工商政策，去年群运时商业也受到些损失，直到阴历二月半，商人都还不安心营业，全是支应门面，甚至想关门。王介年的杂货铺，常关着门，过集也不开。大街上门面房子没人赁，商人普遍的顾虑是：（一）对土地法不摸底，愿等摸了底再说。没有农会股、村干股、群众合作社股，就不敢开门。王全印杂货铺要求村干算股才敢开门。村干给解释保护工商业，他仍然说：“您不算股我反正不开门！”干着买卖怕人家说财物大，不作了好缩小目标。有些馍馍房、曲、面房自己忙不过来，也不敢雇人，怕说是剥削。（二）另外一个原因是嫌去年征收营业税重，怕赚不了钱还叫拿。随即召集商人大会，强调保护工商业，声明以后如再伤害了工商业，大家有权向政府控诉；宣布去年工商业的损失由群众讨论补还。而后又开小组会，个别谈心思话，商人顾虑全打破了。有的说：“这个会要早开几天，你看多好！”都后悔白白耽误了自己的买卖，少赚了钱，当天就有两三户找房主要赁门面。现在全镇门面都赁完了，各商号正积极修补门面。最怕斗争的王介杂货铺也开了门，面房掌柜王计纯说：“去年我不敢雇人磨面，不知少赚多少钱？”他现在已雇了磨面工人干活。商人见到报上登有边府命令取消路条制度，都说：“政府真是照顾商人哪！”
