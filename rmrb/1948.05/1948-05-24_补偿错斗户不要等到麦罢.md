　　Compensate Wrongfully Classified Households Before the Wheat Harvest Ends
    In recent days, this newspaper has received five letters from Handan City in succession. The content is mostly the calls from middle peasants and small industrial and commercial operators who have been wrongly classified. Some of these letters do not specifically point out the names of villages and people, and it remains to be investigated whether the reflections are completely true. We do not know much about the progress of the correction in Handan. These materials and opinions can be provided to the leaders of Handan for research. It is hoped that they will conduct an immediate inspection, and take specific and effective measures to deal with the resistance of village cadres, and quickly promote the progress of the correction work.

    He Shoude, Niu Yulin and other eleven people wrote in a letter: "Some people in the commercial district of Handan are shop assistants, some are partners in small businesses, and they save money to buy some land. The village cadres say that they eat and dress better in the shops than farmers. Because of this, after the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, they will be swept out of the house and confiscated. It is often reported in the newspapers that not a single person should be wronged, but many villages here ignore this matter… They want to wait until the wheat harvest is over to return the property, and the property will be distributed. The property of the wrongly classified households is kept in the Farmers' Association, and the Farmers' Association is patient, but the wrongly classified households cannot bear it. Some village cadres feel ashamed to return the property, and some village cadres say, 'Even if we die, we will not return it.' Some village cadres say, 'It will not be unsealed until Chairman Mao comes in person; if he says he is a middle peasant, we say he is a landlord and rich peasant, what counts as evidence…?' These people have suffered since childhood, but they never thought they would become 'targets' (meaning targets of struggle) today. Now the village cadres are trying their best to lend the property of the wrongly classified to the masses, and the wrongly classified households have no choice but to wait."
    Zhao Chengyu and other three people wrote in a letter: "Handan has developed commerce in recent years, and it is better to do small business and be a shop assistant than before. If you accumulate a little more, you will be classified as a landlord or rich peasant and confiscated. The village leaders resist the superior's methods, such as saying: 'If the people who were beaten to death in other villages can come back to life, then we can unseal it.' Some said: 'Talk to the masses, and be sure to compensate after the wheat harvest, or ask him to take out a bank loan and let him compensate himself!' In this way, if we have to wait until the wheat harvest or after autumn, the households that have been struggled against will really suffer."
    Li Qun, Zheng Yang and other four people wrote in a letter: "Your newspaper constantly publishes reports about compensating wrongly classified middle peasants. Several cadres here say that compensation is too shameful. Some said: Chairman Mao's policy says democracy, and our village will be run by us. Each person in the masses can get clothes and other items, and we can guarantee that they can be convinced. The superiors have no way to do anything. No matter which mass you investigate, the masses will benefit from it, so he can't find out anything. It is often said that the dyeing workshop cannot produce white cloth, and what is eaten cannot be spit out. We should quickly find a way to distribute it to the masses, or lend it to poor households, and don't store things. This can be said to be a win-win-win situation." How to solve the current clothing difficulties of such wrongly classified households?…………
    Liu Weidong wrote in a letter: "I saw beggars on Heping Avenue in Handan City. According to my understanding, most of the families of the beggars were struggled against and are now unable to live. I have a question, were the people who were struggled against in the past all correct? (Even if the struggle is correct, they should be resettled - Editor) It is a concrete manifestation of leftism and a mistake that we have such a phenomenon in our liberated areas, and it should be resettled."…………

### 补偿错斗户不要等到麦罢

专栏：群众呼声

　　补偿错斗户不要等到麦罢
    近几天本报连续收到来自邯郸市的五封信，内容大都是些错斗中农、小工商业者的呼声，这些来信中有些没有具体指出村名人名，反映是否完全真实，也还需要再作调查。对邯郸纠偏进行的情况，我们不很了解，这些材料和意见，可提供邯郸领导上研究。希能即作检查，对村干的抵抗，也需采取具体有效办法，迅速推动纠偏工作的进行。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    何守德、牛玉林等十一人来信说：“邯郸商业区有些人当店员、有些合伙做小买卖，省吃俭用添置点地，村干部就说在铺里比农民吃得好穿得好。就这一堆，土地法大纲公布后，就要扫地出门没收干净。报上常登说不屈一个人，这里许多村就不理这个事……要等待麦罢退还，财物就分发完。错斗户财物保存在农会，农会沉住气了，错斗户可吃不住劲了。有些村干嫌退回丢人伤脸，有的村干部说：“就叫咱死了也不能退还。”有的村干说：“非等毛主席亲自来才能启封；他说他是中农，咱说他是地富，啥算证据………？”这些人自幼受苦受罪，不想今天成了“对象”（斗争对象之意）。现在村干尽量是将错斗的财物借给群众，错斗户只好光等。
    赵成玉等三人来信说：“邯郸近几年来商业发达，做小买卖当小伙计比先前好，圪堆稍大点，就要划成地主富农成分，没收光。村带头人抵抗上级办法，如说：‘外村打死的人，能活了，咱就能启封。’有的说：‘与群众说成一劲，一定麦忙罢补偿，或叫他银行贷款，叫他自己补自己吧！’这样要一直等到麦罢或秋后，被斗户可真正受不了。”
    李群、郑羊等四人来信说：“贵报不断登补偿错斗中农，这里几个干部说补偿太丢人。有的说：毛主席政策说民主，咱村就由咱办。群众每个人均能分得衣物等，保证能说成一气，上级他也没有办法，无论向那个群众调查，群众都有好处，叫他打问不出来。常说染坊倒不出白布来，吃了不能吐出来，咱可赶快想办法与群众分了，或借给贫苦户，不存东西，这个可说三全其美。”这样错斗户眼前衣物困难，如何解决？…………
    刘维东来信说：“我看到邯郸市和平大街上有讨饭吃的，据我了解讨饭的人，家庭大部是被斗了的，现在无法生活。我有个疑问，过去被斗的是否都正确？（即斗的正确，也应安置——编者）我们解放区内有这种现象是左倾的具体表现，是错误的，应该给予安置。”…………
