Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 20th. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Postal Administration convened a joint conference in mid-April of post office directors from the Suide Sub-district and some post office directors from the Yanshu and Huanglong sub-districts to review the wartime postal work of the past year and discuss future development. Wang Ziyi, Acting Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Region Government, attended and provided guidance. Chairman Lin and Vice-Chairman Yang also invited the post office directors to a forum, giving detailed instructions on the role of postal work in the people's revolutionary war, pointing out that postal work is a very important political task, not a simple technical task. In the future, it should cooperate with the rapid development of the Northwest situation to build the postal cause of the people of the Northwest. Acting Director Wang proposed that the people's requirements for the post office are to be loyal and reliable receivers, dispatchers, and transporters for the people. The central task of postal work in the future is, first of all, to develop postal work in the newly liberated areas and prepare a large number of cadres to go to the new areas. He emphasized that in developing work in the new areas, it is necessary to strive to transform old postal personnel to serve the people. He said: "This is not only necessary but also possible. As long as we correctly implement the policy, most of them can be won over. Secondly, it is necessary to deepen postal work into the countryside, gradually achieving rural postal service, so that the government and the masses, this place and that place, are closely linked."

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 20th. Postal workers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have consistently maintained contact between the front and rear areas during the year of the People's Revolutionary War, completed the postal task, and produced a large number of heroic models. Last April, when the bandit Hu invaded Wayaobao, postal worker Li Shengcai cleverly and bravely defeated the enemy's vanguard plainclothes team on the way from Laowajie to Hejiawan, but when he arrived at Hejiawan, the organization had already moved. He continued to run for three days and finally delivered the mail to the receiving organization. Li Guopei discovered enemy activity on his way back from ＠ County to Zhidan. He hid in the woods, climbed onto a tree branch to conceal himself, ate raw rice to satisfy his hunger, and finally cleverly got through. Zhang Mantang encountered the enemy "mopping up" on the road. During the day, he hid the mail and helped the villagers hoe weeds and inquire about the enemy's situation and terrain, and at night he carried the mailbag to travel. Last August, when Li Wenchang and Li Mao Li were traveling to a certain town, they had just entered a restaurant to rest when the town was suddenly surrounded by bandit Hu. At this time, the landlady and her daughter-in-law quickly helped them hide the mail and tried to deal with the enemy. Although the enemy repeatedly inquired, they did not reveal any flaws and escaped safely.

The enemy carried out "mopping up" to create a no-man's land, but the postal workers still traveled through the no-man's land. The postal route from ＠ County to Guanzhong was cut off, so they passed through the uninhabited mountains, eating dry food and drinking ice and snow, and camping in the mountains at night, resolutely completing the task.

　　陕甘宁邮政会议
  　决定开展新区邮政工作
    【新华社西北二十日电】陕甘宁边区邮政管理局，于四月中旬召集绥德分区各邮局局长及延属黄龙两分区部分邮局局长联席会议，检讨一年来的战时邮政工作及讨论今后开展问题。边区政府民政厅王代厅长子宜亲临指导。林杨正副主席并约集各局长举行座谈，对邮政工作在人民革命战争中的作用指示甚详，指出邮政工作是一件很重要的政治任务，不是简单技术工作，今后应配合大西北形势的迅速开展，建设西北人民的邮政事业。王代厅长提出人民对邮政局的要求是给人民做忠实可靠的收发员、通讯员、运输员。邮政工作今后的中心任务，首先是开展新解放区的邮政工作，准备大批干部到新区去。他着重指出开展新区工作中必须大量争取旧邮政人员转变过来为人民服务，他说：“这不仅是需要而且是可能的，只要我们正确的执行政策，其中大多数是可以争取的。其次是要把邮政工作深入到乡村中去，逐渐达到乡村通邮，使政府与群众、此地与彼地紧密的联系起来”。
    【新华社西北二十日电】陕甘宁边区邮工在一年人民革命战争中始终保持了前后方的联系，完成了通邮任务，并涌现大批英雄模范。去年四月胡匪进犯瓦窑堡时，邮工李生财从老洼界到贺家湾途中，机智英勇的击溃了敌人先头便衣队，但到贺家湾时机关已转移了，他就继续跑了三天，终于将邮件送到收件的机关。李国培由＠县返志丹途中，发现敌情，他便到树林里爬到树技上隐蔽起来，用生米充饥，最后机智地通过。张满堂在路上碰着敌人“清剿”，白天就将邮件掩藏起来帮助老乡锄草，打听敌情地形，晚上再背起邮包赶路。去年八月李文昌和李茂李行至某镇，刚走进一家饭店准备休息，突然该镇被胡匪包围了，这时店主家婆媳二人连忙帮助他们掩藏邮件，设法应付敌人。虽然敌人一再查询，均未露破绽，安然脱险。
    敌人进行“清剿”制造无人区，邮工们仍然通行无人区内。＠县到关中去的邮路被切断了，他们便从无人烟的大山中通过，吃干粮喝冰雪，晚上露宿山野，坚决完成任务。
