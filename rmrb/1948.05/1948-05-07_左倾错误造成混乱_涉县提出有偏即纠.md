　　Leftist Errors Cause Confusion
  　Shexian Proposes Immediate Correction of Deviations
    [Shexian News] Shexian convened a meeting of responsible cadres such as district committee secretaries and district heads on the 23rd of last month to examine spring plowing and correct deviations. According to reports from various districts, in more than twenty days, only general publicity and mobilization were carried out, with the principle of "whoever plants, harvests." Some cadres failed to seize the opportunity to solve specific obstacles in production. Although the masses' mood was relatively stable, confusion still existed in individual villages. For example, in the Third District, bad elements organized fake poor peasant leagues to create trouble and seize power, putting forward slogans such as: "Whether you have anything or not, the poor peasants have the say." They blindly opposed the cadres and opposed providing land cultivation on behalf of military families: "They voluntarily joined the army, eat public food, wear public clothes, why should we cultivate land for them? If they don't have labor, they can hire people themselves." In Baishuiquan, Second District, bad elements sentenced cadres, deciding who should be fined, beaten, dragged, killed, or scraped, causing great panic among cadres. In Dongdacheng, a poor peasant representative beat people and assigned tasks for himself, which the masses disagreed with, so he randomly labeled people. In the Ninth District, poor peasants such as Yang Muxin manipulated the political power, and all matters, large and small, in the village had to be approved by them. Honest and upright poor peasants disagreed, cadres did not act, and middle peasants did not dare to speak up. They were afraid of being divided, afraid of being struggled against, and their production enthusiasm was not high. Secondly, the county party committee repeatedly proposed correcting the infringement of the interests of middle peasants, but the cadres only paid lip service, and the leftist thinking was not reversed. Under the pretext of being unable to compensate, they refused to correct the wrongly struggled middle peasants and refused to open the sealed properties of middle peasants, leaving loose ends in preparation for further struggle. For example, in Yuanqu, Fifth District, when it was re-investigated four times last year, forty-six households were sealed. According to the district cadres, there was one rich peasant, two well-to-do middle peasants, and the rest were middle peasants, and even some poor peasants. However, when the cadres went to unseal and open the doors, they still told the people uniformly: "The property has been registered and cannot be reduced. In the future, the masses will have to pay in full according to the list." The sealed middle peasants reflected: "Opening is equal to not opening. We are acting as custodians for others." Since the ownership is not returned, the middle peasants are still burdened with the fear of struggle and cannot concentrate on production. In Baishuiquan, Second District, middle peasants were forced to borrow grain, and this has not yet been corrected.
    In its summary, the county party committee affirmed the principle of correcting deviations as soon as they occur, and pointed out that some cadres were not bold enough in dealing with fake poor peasant leagues, which was irresponsible to the people's cause. Some poor peasant leagues were organized by themselves and were afraid of losing their prestige, so they did not dare to openly announce their dissolution and stop their activities, adopting a conciliatory approach, which was completely wrong. Some comrades cannot thoroughly correct the deviation of infringing on the interests of middle peasants because they are afraid of taking the wrong path and want to leave loose ends for further struggle against middle peasants. This must be overcome quickly, with a serious attitude, grasping the principles, and handling it boldly, eliminating obstacles to production, and actively promoting production. We cannot wait for the future democratic party rectification and replenishment movement to solve it. (Zhao Weijun)

### 左倾错误造成混乱　涉县提出有偏即纠

　　左倾错误造成混乱
  　涉县提出有偏即纠
    【涉县消息】涉县于上月二十三日召开区分委、区长等负责干部会议，检查春耕和纠偏。从各区汇报看，二十多天的时间，只作了一般的宣传动员，谁种谁收。有些干部没有抓紧解决生产中的具体障碍。虽然群众情绪比较安定了，但个别村混乱现象仍然存在。如三区有坏分子组织假贫雇团捣乱专权，提出口号是：“有啥没啥，贫雇说话。”盲目与干部对立，反对给军属代耕：“他们自愿参军，吃公家饭，穿公家衣，还给他们代耕干啥？没有劳力自己雇人。”二区白泉水坏分子给干部判罪，谁该罚、打、拖、杀、刮等，造成干部大恐慌。东达城贫雇代表打人，派差给自己做活，群众不同意，他就乱戴帽子。九区贫雇杨木新等操纵政权，村中大小事都要经过他们批准。老实正派的贫雇不同意，干部不动，中农不敢吭气。怕平分，怕挨斗，生产情绪不高。其次县委一再提出的纠正侵犯中农利益，干部只口头应付，左倾思想没有扭转。借口无法补偿，斗错中农不肯纠正，查封中农不肯开放，留下尾巴，准备再斗。如五区原曲，去年四次复查时封门四十六户，据区干部说，内有富农一户，富裕中农二户，其余都是中农，甚至还有贫农。但是干部去启封开门时，仍然一律告诉人家：“财产已登记，不能短少，将来群众要照单交清。”被查封中农反映：“开放等于不开放，咱是给人家当保管”。所有权不归还，中农仍背着怕斗争的包袱，还不能安心生产。二区白泉水强迫中农借粮，至今还没纠正。
    县委在总结中，肯定提出有偏即纠，并指出有些干部对假贫雇团处理不大胆，是对人民事业不负责。有的贫雇团是自己组织起来的，怕失掉自己威信，不敢公开宣布解散，停止其活动，采取调和办法，是完全错误的。有些同志不能彻底纠正侵犯中农利益的偏向，怕走错路，就是想留下尾巴，再斗中农。必须迅速克服，严肃态度，掌握原则，大胆处理，扫除生产障碍，积极推进生产。不能等待将来民主整党填补运动中再解决。（赵伟俊）
