Changzhi City Three Districts Fully Correct Deviations
　Repeatedly Publicize, Conduct In-depth Investigations, and Immediately Resolve Problems
[Changzhi News] Since the enlarged cadre meeting of the three districts of Changzhi City on April 20, a serious review of the deviations in the implementation of industrial and commercial policies in the past has been conducted. As of the 5th of this month, district cadres have repeatedly publicized industrial and commercial policies in various streets, combined with investigations, discovered problems, cleared up mass thinking, solved one problem at a time, and the whole district has now generally and preliminarily begun a comprehensive deviation correction work. The problems that have been resolved generally fall into three categories: (1) After the Land Law Outline came down last winter, the district management of landlords (including those who had been struggled against but not classified) impounded their shares in shops, cooperatives, and mutual aid groups through the street offices. Now, all have been returned. A total of 168 households in the five streets of the district have been refunded, with capital totaling 2.03 million yuan, dividends totaling 1.04 million yuan, wages earned in the production department totaling 490,000 yuan, 10 dan of millet, rent totaling 5.04 million yuan, 2 dou of rice, 33,000 yuan from confiscated property, 13 jin of thread from women's groups spinning, and 20 chi of cloth. In addition, two households that were accused of sabotaging the Land Law by selling things and had their doors sealed have now been unsealed. (2) Under the slogan of "Citizens stand up," some industrial and commercial enterprises were struggled against. Some were cases of "replacing the god but not the temple," some were not distributed, and some had already been distributed. These were dealt with separately. For those where the god was replaced but not the temple and the original objects were not distributed to the masses, the original objects were returned to the original owners. For those that had been distributed to the masses and the original objects were damaged, compensation was given at a discounted price. A total of seven households were dealt with in this way, large and small. Tian Yingfu of Xiabei Street opened a flour mill and worked himself. When squeezing out feudalism last June, because he had rented out dozens of mu of land five or six years ago, he was classified as a tenant rich peasant, and all his flour mill furniture, livestock, and capital of 190,000 yuan were confiscated and operated by the masses as a whole. This time, the livestock and furniture were all returned, and 480,000 yuan of principal and interest were also returned. Liu Mize's small paint shop in Xia Dong Street was compensated at an estimated value of 450,000 yuan. The antiques stalls of Qin Sizhen and Zhen Gengcheng in Shangbei Street, Zhang Yao's salt stall in Shang Dong Street, Wang Xiuzhen's weaving machine in Xia Dong Street, and Cui Shilin's bicycle in Dongshangren Street – these items were confiscated by the masses and are still kept in the street office. Now, all the original objects have been returned. (3) Compulsory mutual aid production actually restricted the development of private capital. Four cases have now been resolved. For example, Li Ergou of the Tongyi He Lard Shop in Xia Dong Street was afraid and opened a joint venture with others, collecting 300,000 yuan of mass capital (more than 100 shares). The Tongsheng Tannery was also forcibly organized by street cadres, bringing together Xu Fanhaizi (a leather worker) and others to work for the masses, with a capital of 760,000 yuan (more than 130 shares). People had their own capital, but they were not allowed to do it themselves, or they were afraid and did not dare to do it themselves. Now, with the publicity of industrial and commercial policies and the development of private capital, under the influence of returning wrongly struggled against cases, they dare to develop. We immediately cleared up their thinking through the masses, withdrew the mass shares, and let them do it themselves. Du Changyou's cotton ginning factory in Shangbei Street had seven shareholders who withdrew 200,000 yuan of capital to reorganize production themselves. In this way, most of the remaining shares became the workers' own capital, and both parties were satisfied. Xu Yusheng, a worker at the Yihe Tannery in Xin Dong Street, originally had 150,000 yuan of capital. Last winter, it was decided that he would not be allowed to share dividends, and the profits were distributed to the masses (because he lent 2,000 yuan to a pawnshop, he was managed in the name of feudalism and not allowed to share dividends). The earned profits were also returned to him. The small-scale mutual aid in other streets was also very compulsory. Now, they are all being adjusted under the principle of voluntariness. Those that are not suitable are dispersed and reorganized.
　　As a result of solving the above problems, the fear of struggle and reluctance to develop among a large number of citizens has been eliminated. Those who have been refunded reflected: "The Communist Party is truly not wronging anyone." Now they are all actively producing. Liu Mize brought capital to the Minyi Cloth Shop, Tian Yingfu started his flour mill again, and Lin Gongbiao of Xin Dong Street also dug out the goods buried underground and reopened for business. Shen Yunbao of Xia Dong Street organized three people and opened a retail department on the street. The masses' production enthusiasm generally has a new development. The withdrawn shares, for those without labor, are transferred to other shops, and those with labor organize production themselves.

　　长市三区全面纠偏
  　反复宣传深入调查发现问题立即解决
    【长治消息】长市三区经过四月二十号全区扩干会议，认真检查了过去执行工商政策的偏向。截至本月五号，区干部在各街反复宣传工商政策，结合进行调查，发现问题，打通群众思想，发现一个问题，解决一个问题，全区现已普遍的初步开始了全面纠偏工作。解决过的问题，一般有三种类型：（一）去冬土地法大纲下来以后，我区管理地主（斗过的不分成份都在内）中把他们在商店、合作社、互助组入的股金，都经街公所扣下，现已一律退还。全区五个街，共退了一百六十八户，资本洋二百零三万元，红利洋一百零四万元，在生产部赚的工资洋四十九万元，小米十石，房租洋五千余元，米二斗，变产扣下钱三万三千元，妇女小组纺花扣线十三斤，布二十尺。另有卖东西被诬为破坏土地法封了门的二户，现已启封。（二）在市民翻身口号下，斗争了一些工商业，有的是换神不换庙，有的是没有分配，有的已分配，均分别作了处理。换神不换庙和原物未分给群众的，将原物退还原主。已分散给群众，原物损坏者，给以折价补偿。大小处理了七户。下北街田迎福，自己开粉坊，自己劳动，去年六月挤封建时，因为他前五、六年时出租过几十亩地，划他为佃富农，把他粉坊家具、牲口一个和资本十九万元，全部没收，归群众原盘经营。这次把牲口、家具全部退还，又退本利洋四十八万元。下东街刘迷则的小颜料铺，估价补偿四十五万元。上北街秦四珍和甄根成二人的古董摊，上东街张耀的盐摊，下东街王秀珍的织布机，东商人街崔士林的自行车子，这些东西群众没收后，仍在街公所保管，现把原物全部退回。（三）强制组织起的互助生产，实际上限制了私人资本发展，现已解决的四起。如下东街同意合腊肉铺的李二过，因害怕，与人合开，又集三十几万群众资本（一百多股），同胜皮坊，也是街干部把许反孩（皮工）等强组织在一块，给群众干，资本七十六万元（一百三十几股），人家自己有资本，不让人家自己搞，或是自己害怕，也不敢自己搞；现在在宣传工商业政策，发展私人资本，退还错斗的影响下，他们敢发展了，积极要求自己搞。我们即通过群众，打通思想，退出群众股，让人家自己干起来了。上北街杜长有弹花厂，七个股东抽出二十万元资金重新自己组织生产。这样留下的股，大部都成了里边工人自己的资本，双方都合了意。新东街义合皮坊工人许玉生，原十五万元资金，去冬决定不让人家分红，所得红利分给群众（因他借给一个当铺二千元钱，便以封建为名实行管理，不让人家分红），亦将所赚红利归了本人。其余各街的小型互助，强制性也很大，现在都在自愿原则下普遍调整，不合适的分散，重新组织。
    由于解决了以上问题，消除一大部分市民怕斗不敢发展的思想。被退还的人反映说：“共产党真是不屈一个人。”现都积极生产。刘迷则带上资本到民意布店，田迎福又闹起粉坊，新东街林功标把地下埋的货也刨出来，重新营业。下东街申云保组织了三个人在街上开了个门市部。群众的生产情绪，一般有了新的发展。退出来的股金，没劳力的，另人到其它商店了，有劳力的则自己组织生产。
