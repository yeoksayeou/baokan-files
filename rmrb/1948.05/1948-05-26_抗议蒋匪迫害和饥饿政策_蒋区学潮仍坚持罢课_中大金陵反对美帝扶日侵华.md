　　Protesting Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang's Persecution and Famine Policies
  　Student Protests in Chiang-Controlled Areas Persist in Strikes
  　Nanjing University and Jinling University Oppose U.S. Imperialism's Support for Japan's Aggression Against China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] According to various sources: Students at Shanghai Jiaotong University have initiated a full-scale strike starting from the 20th to protest the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's violent act of arresting five graduates from the university on the 14th of this month. Furthermore, according to a TASS dispatch citing the Shanghai News on the 20th, several universities in Shanghai have launched anti-hunger strikes, demanding lower rice prices and increased educational funding. These strikes have continued to persist until the 19th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] According to foreign news agency reports: Students at Nanjing University and Jinling University have launched a movement opposing U.S. imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese aggressive forces, which threatens China's survival. All students at Nanjing University held a memorial meeting on the 20th for the one-year anniversary of the "May 20th Bloodshed Incident" (on this day last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang simultaneously carried out bloody massacres of student protesters against hunger and civil war in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tianjin, causing a shocking tragedy both domestically and internationally). The memorial venue was covered with slogans calling on the people of the nation to "Oppose U.S. Imperialism's Support for Japanese Fascist Aggression" and "Oppose the Sale of Economic Resources in South China." At the memorial meeting, students vehemently denounced U.S. imperialism's support for Japan's aggression against China and the Kuomintang's traitorous behavior of appeasing the U.S. and being pro-Japanese. "Jinling University is also planning to hold a demonstration against the United States' policy towards Japan."
