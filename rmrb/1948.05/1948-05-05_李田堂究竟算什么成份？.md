To the Editors:
　　Regarding Li Tiantang in People's Daily issue 654, "Shili Shop Carefully Classifies Class Status," his family has two people and 5.9 mu of land. There was no famine, but they also have no house or farm tools. Although the yield is relatively good, it is still farmed by others on his behalf. When our county study group researched this, based on the situation in the newspaper, we felt that it was inappropriate to classify him as a new middle peasant solely based on his grain production. We believe that class status should be determined based on whether he owns land and production tools, and whether there is a relationship of exploitation.
　　In addition, the worker explained during classification that this time there will be no classification of lower-middle peasants; a middle peasant is simply a middle peasant, and a poor peasant is simply a poor peasant. I also know that the class of lower-middle peasant basically no longer exists, but at the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee reorganization meeting, the category of lower-middle peasant was constantly mentioned, and it was said that lower-middle peasants should participate in the poor peasant association. Is this category still being used in rural areas given such explanations?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Hu Xizheng)

Comrade Hu Xizheng:
　　(1) It is correct to classify Li Tiantang as a new middle peasant. His land yield is no lower than that of a middle peasant. Although he has no house, he borrows housing from others without paying rent. He currently has no labor, but because one person in his family joined the army, the land is farmed by the village on his behalf, as if he were home. He doesn't farm the land now, so naturally, he doesn't need farm tools. In addition, his life is no worse than that of a middle peasant, and he has no debts. He has the main means of production (land), and neither exploits nor is exploited by others; he only turned himself over after the establishment of the democratic government; therefore, he should be considered a new middle peasant.
　　(2) It was wrong of the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee reorganization meeting to say that there is a lower-middle peasant category and that they can participate in the poor peasant association. If the conditions are sufficient for a middle peasant, then he is a middle peasant. If not, he is a poor peasant. Generally, the category of "upper-lower middle peasant" is created to reduce the scope of benefiting from the revolution; in reality, many poor peasants are classified as middle peasants.

### 李田堂究竟算什么成份？

　　李田堂究竟算什么成份？编辑同志：
    人民日报六五四号“什里店慎重划阶级”内有一户叫李田堂，他家有二口人，五亩九分地，没饥荒，但也没房没农具，虽说产量比较好，还是别人给代耕。我县学习小组研究时，根据报上情形，认为光依靠他的产粮生活划成新中农有点不合适，我们划成份应按他土地、生产工具占有否，及剥削关系来确定。
    另外在划时，工作员解释，这次不划下中农，中农就是中农，贫农就是贫农。我也知道基本已没有下中农这个阶级，但在太行五地委整编会议上，不断提下中农这个成份，并说下中农要参加贫农团，象这样解释，在乡村中是否还划这个成份呢？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（胡西征）胡西征同志：
    （一）李田堂划成新中农是对的。他的土地产量不低于中农，虽没房子，但借住别人的房子也不出房租；他自己现在没劳力，但因一口人参军而土地由村里代耕，和他在家一样；他现在既不种地，自然也不需要农具。另外，生活也不低于中农，也没有负债。主要的生产工具（土地）有了，不剥削别人也不受剥削；是民主政府成立后才翻身的；所以应是新中农。
    （二）太行五地委整编会议上说有下中农成份，而且说可以参加贫农团，这是说错了的。条件够中农就是中农，不够就是贫农。一般划出个“上下中农”成份，都是为了缩小得果实面；实际把不少贫农划成中农了。
