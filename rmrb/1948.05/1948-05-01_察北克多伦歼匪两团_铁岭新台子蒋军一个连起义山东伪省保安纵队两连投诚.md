Our intense artillery fire assisted the infantry in quickly entering the city. After seventeen hours of fierce fighting, the battle was resolved by noon on the 27th, and all the defending bandits were annihilated. The stronghold with the strongest semi-permanent defense fortifications built by Chiang bandits in the hinterland of Shandong was finally crushed.

The broad masses of people who had suffered years of reactionary rule by the Japanese, Wang, and Chiang bandits finally saw the light of day.
