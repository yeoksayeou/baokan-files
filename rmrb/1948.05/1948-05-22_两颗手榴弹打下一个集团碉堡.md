　　Two Hand Grenades Take Down a Group Bunker
    Sha Teng
    On the night of March 7th, a unit of the "Yichang" troops, after a seventy-li forced march, stopped when they were close to the enemy. Company Commander Liu Changsheng led two platoons, marching valiantly towards the eastern heights of Nanxiao Village, north of Linfen City. At this time, the east was gradually turning white, and the shadows of them hurried across the horizon and down. The bunker complex arranged on the southern heights vaguely appeared in front of everyone. The soldiers gently lifted the barbed wire and climbed in. But everything around was still quiet. Everyone had already jumped over the outer trench, and apart from bursts of snoring, the bunkers were still silent. Everyone jumped in with surprise, and the sentry posts on all sides blindly fired a shot. Company Commander Liu immediately shouted, "Don't shoot, it's us!" The gunfire stopped immediately. At this time, several enemies staggered out of the bunker. After discovering that it was the People's Liberation Army, they prepared to resist, but the soldiers immediately threw two hand grenades and victoriously pounced on each bunker. The enemies inside, with their pants in their hands, looked at each other in dismay. After a while, they had to slowly say, "We surrender!" When the soldiers escorted a platoon of surrendered enemies out of this bloody bunker complex, the Linfen bandit army, who had spent a great deal of effort building fortifications, was still dreaming. In this way, our army used two hand grenades to take down one of their group pillboxes.

　　两颗手榴弹打下一个集团碉堡
    沙藤
    三月七日的夜里，“宜昌”部队一部，经七十里的急行军，在快接近敌人的时候，部队停止了。连长刘长胜带着两个班，雄纠纠的向着临汾城北南孝村的东高地前进。此时东方渐渐发白，他们几个人的影子急促地划过地平线，爬下去了。南高地排列着的地堡群，隐约出现在大家面前。战士们轻轻地挑起铁丝网，爬了进去。但四周仍然静悄悄的。大家已经跳过外壕，碉堡里除了一阵阵的鼾声外，仍然一声不响。大家惊喜地跳了进去，四边哨棚才盲目地打了一枪。刘连长马上喊道：“不用打，自己人！”枪声立刻灵验的停止了。此时，地堡里踉踉跄跄露出几个敌人。发现是人民解放军后，还准备抵抗，战士们马上投了两颗手榴弹，胜利的扑到各个地堡。里边的敌人手提着裤子，面面相觑，呆了一会，只好慢吞吞的说：“我们缴枪”！当战士们押着投降过来的一个排走出这块血腥的碉堡群时，费了九牛二虎之力修筑工事的临汾匪军还在做梦。这样，我军以两颗手榴弹打下了他的一个集团暗堡。
