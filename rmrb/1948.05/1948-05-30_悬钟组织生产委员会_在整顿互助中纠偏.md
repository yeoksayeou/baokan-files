　　Xuanzhong Organizes Production Committee
  　To Correct Deviations in Rectifying Mutual Aid
    [News from Shexian] Xuanzhong Village, in the Second District, shifted from democratic party rectification to production, and is conducting filling and deviation correction in production. On the night of the 6th, the first Farmers' Representative Conference was held to discuss the village's work policy focusing on production, combined with compensating middle peasants, removing labels and filling gaps. A production committee was established, with eleven cadres including the village chief, Farmers' Association director, and production director participating (including five representatives). The production committee and representatives were assigned to different streets to rectify mutual aid groups, discussing the above issues within the groups, so that production was not delayed, and work could be discussed. After eight or nine days of rectification, a total of twenty-one mutual aid groups were organized in the village, with 130 households participating. They are currently irrigating the seedlings, preparing to hoe the wheat fields twice, and planting corn and beans. The following problems were solved in the rectification of mutual aid:
    In this village, thirty-four households were "struggled against" during the land reform, accounting for 16.4% of the total number of households in the village. Among them, thirty households were middle peasants, accounting for 17.29% of the entire middle peasant class. Two households of landlords were downgraded to rich peasants (they were rich peasants during the land reform and have now become middle peasants), and they were struggled against. Now, only two rich peasant households have also been swept out the door. In addition, thirty-one people in the village were labeled as special agents, including twenty-two middle peasants (eight new middle peasants) and nine landlords and rich peasants (including five who have died). Judging from the above situation, the interests of the middle peasants were seriously infringed upon, we attacked ourselves, and expanded the enemy in the land reform and last year's review. Fifty-two households and 182 farmers were shut out. Therefore, compensating the middle peasants and removing labels is an important matter in this village, and after the Farmers' Representative Conference made a decision, it was discussed and deliberated in the mutual aid groups.
    When discussing compensating middle peasants in the mutual aid groups, some households who had not been allocated houses disagreed with returning houses to the middle peasants, saying: "He has no house to live in, and I have no house to live in." Others said: "We were told to struggle against him in the past, and we didn't want to at the time, but we were forced to struggle, saying that whoever struggled would get the spoils. As a result, the middle peasants were also struggled against." At this time, the leadership, on the one hand, reviewed the past and, on the other hand, enlightened and guided everyone to understand why it was necessary to compensate the middle peasants. Compensating the middle peasants is beneficial to everyone. For example, Liu Jingtang and Wang Jiming said in the discussion: "My opinion is that we must resolutely return the land. We didn't recognize the enemy from ourselves in the past when we were struggling against them. We chased our own people out! Today, we must draw a clear line between the classes and bring our own people back. If we don't do this, our share of the spoils will not be guaranteed, and who will dare to produce and prosper in the future!" Everyone agreed with his opinion, and it was decided to first ask the middle peasants to move back home (the houses had not been distributed yet). Those who didn't have farm tools were asked to join mutual aid groups, borrow them first, and then buy them later. They were also absorbed into the Farmers' Association, and grain was lent to those who didn't have anything to eat. The next day, a meeting of the households of the middle peasants who had been struggled against was held. First, the leadership made a review, explaining that the class boundaries were not clear in the past, and it was wrong to drive our own people out. Today, we must compensate everyone for the losses. Then, Yang Fuchang said: "There is nothing else, just that farm tools and seeds are difficult. I am very happy to be asked to move back to my original house. I never thought there would be today!" Yang Shuiquan said: "I have already joined a mutual aid group, and all the farm tools are used by the group." Zhang Yonghe said: "It doesn't matter if I return things, as long as everyone asks me to go back, I am very satisfied. It is good to be able to stand with the masses. The empty houses above can be lent to everyone to live in after I move back." Three households have already moved back, and others are moving back.
    The Farmers' Representative Conference discussed removing the special agent labels. Because the anti-special agent campaigns in the past relied on forced confessions, the special agent labels were randomly put on the heads of the peasants. There are a total of thirty-one people in the village who wear special agent hats. Since they were labeled as special agents in 1943, they have not been able to hold their heads up, and many people shed tears when they mention this. When discussing removing the hats, some people proposed to trace the roots to see who put them on us. Some people also proposed that we should never trace the roots, because wouldn't that be another chaotic counter-attack? When fighting against the special agents in the past, wasn't it necessary to pursue, beat, and hang people, and still couldn't put on these many special agent hats! After everyone discussed it, it was decided not to trace the roots. Those who have not damaged the facts will be removed, that is, even if they said some "backward words" in the past, they cannot be said to be special agents. Real special agents who have confessed and do not do destructive things should also be removed. After mass deliberation and two rounds of discussion, a total of eighteen people were removed, and the discussion and deliberation are still continuing in the mutual aid groups.
    Borrowing grain and money to solve difficulties in production. In order to solve the current production difficulties, after discussion and research by the Farmers' Representative Conference, a total of 670 kilograms of fine grain was borrowed, and thirteen households borrowed it, with thirty-nine people, including three households of middle peasants who had been struggled against, one household of rich peasants who had been struggled against, four households of poor peasants, two households of middle peasants, and three households of new middle peasants. We are also preparing to borrow money from the Farmers' Association for the middle peasants who have been struggled against and households without farm tools, to buy farm tools. Now we are discussing the land issue, and we are also discussing first drawing some land from the public land to compensate the middle peasants. The things that were not distributed will be returned in their original form, and those that have been distributed will be compensated with other things. After compensation and label removal, the masses said: "We are not afraid anymore. No one will dare to struggle against the middle peasants again in the future, nor can they randomly put special agent hats on us." After the middle peasants who had been struggled against were compensated, production was also very active. For example, Wang Naishuan did not weed his wheat field, which had a lot of weeds a few days ago, but he has weeded the grass and dug the edge of the field these days. Most of them have now joined the Farmers' Association and mutual aid groups.

　　悬钟组织生产委员会
  　在整顿互助中纠偏
    【涉县消息】二区悬钟村，由民主整党转向了生产，在生产中进行填补纠偏。六号黑夜召开了第一届农代会，讨论该村工作方针以生产为主，结合补偿中农，脱帽填补，成立了生产委员会，有村长、农会主任、生产主任等十一个干部参加（内有五个代表），生产委员会和代表们都分工下去到各街整顿互助，在互助里讨论以上问题，这样既不耽误生产，又能讨论工作。经过八、九天的整顿，全村共组织起二十一个互助组，有一百三十户参加。现正在浇地下稻子，准备锄两遍麦地、栽玉茭、豆子。在整顿互助中解决了以下几个问题：
    这村在土改中有三十四户被“斗争”，占全村户数百分之一六·四，其中有三十户是中农，占全部中农阶层的百分之一七·二九，有地主降为富农者二户（土改中是富农，现已变为中农了），被斗争了，现在只有两户富农也被扫地出门了。另外，全村被戴特务帽的有三十一个，其中有中农廿二个（新中农八个），地主富农变成份的九个（内有五个已死）。从以上情况看来，在土改中和去年复查中是严重的侵犯了中农利益，打击了自己，扩大了敌人，有五十二户，一八二个农民被关在了门外。因此在该村补偿中农和脱帽是一件重要的事，经农代会决定后，就在互助组里讨论酝酿。
    在互助里讨论补偿中农时，有些未分到房子的户不同意给中农退，并说：他没有房住，我也没有房住。又有的说：过去斗争他也是上级叫斗的，当时俺不愿，非叫斗不行，说谁斗谁要果实，结果将中农也斗争了。这时领导上一面检讨过去，一面启发诱导大家了解为啥要补偿中农。补偿中农对大家有利，如刘景堂、王吉明在讨论中说：“我意见坚决要退，过去斗争时没有认清敌我，将自家人赶出去了！今天划清阶级，一定要将自己人找回来。不这样，咱分到果实也不保险，以后谁还敢生产发家呢！”大家都很同意他的意见，就决定先叫中农往回搬家（房子未分下去），没有农具的叫他们参加互助，先借用，以后再买，并吸收他们参加农会，没啥吃的借给他粮食。第二天便召开被斗中农户开会，首先领导上做了检讨，说明过去阶级界限不明确，将自己人赶出去是不对的，今天一定要补偿大家损失。接着杨福昌说：“其他没有啥，就是农具种子困难，叫我回原房子里住，我很高兴，真想不到还有今天！”杨水全说：“我已参加了互助组，一切农具都是使用组内的。”张永和说：“退东西倒没啥，只要大家叫我回去，我就很满意，能和群众站在一起就行。我搬回以后，上边的闲房子可借给大家住。”现已有三户搬回，其他正在搬。
    农代会讨论摘特务帽。由于过去反特务是逼供的，将特务帽乱戴到农民头上，全村共有三十一个戴特务帽子的。他们自四三年戴上特务帽子以后，到现在不能抬头，有很多人提起这件事眼里就掉泪。在讨论摘帽时，有些人提出要追根，看看到底谁给咱戴上的。也有人提出咱们决不追根，如果追那不又是乱反了吗？过去反特时不是硬要追打吊，还不能戴上这多特务帽！经大家讨论决定不追根，没有破坏事实的都脱了，就是过去说过些“落后话”，也不能说是特务。是真特务的，经过坦白后不做破坏事的也要脱。经过群众酝酿，前后讨论了两次，共脱了十八个，现还继续在互助组酝酿讨论进行。
    借粮借款解决生产中困难。为了解当前生产困难，经农代会讨论研究，共借出细粮六七○斤，有十三户借的，三九口人，内有被斗中农三户，被斗富农一户，贫农四户，中农两户，新中农三户，还准备从农会里借给被斗中农及没农具户的款，叫他们买农具。现在讨论土地问题，也讨论先从公地里抽些土地来补偿中农，未分的东西原物退回，已分了的拿别的东西补偿。经过补偿脱帽以后，群众说：这咱可不怕了，以后谁也不敢再斗中农了，也不能给咱随便戴特务帽子。被斗中农补偿后，生产也很积极，如王乃拴前几天麦地里草长的很多也不锄，这几天草也锄了，地边也刨了。现大部分已参加了农会和互助组。
