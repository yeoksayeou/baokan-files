    [Yuanshi News] Due to past enemy looting, the Sixth District of this county faced a severe shortage of livestock, creating a significant obstacle to spring plowing and production. The entire Sixth District has 83,198 mu of land, with only 1,877 head of livestock (including 65 mules, 182 cattle, and 1,630 donkeys). Each head of livestock must cultivate an average of 43 mu of land (in reality, with the current lack of grass and feed, each head of livestock cultivates an average of only 15 mu). Dakong Village has 33 qing of land and only 55 head of livestock, with each head of livestock cultivating 60 mu of land. Influenced and promoted by Zhang Lanhe's human-pulled plow, many households in the village are also doing this, voluntarily organizing 13 small mutual aid groups. Li Heizi and two other families have 50 mu of land without livestock, and all plowing and sowing is done by people pulling the plow. Zhang Shuzi and two others have 40 mu of land, and more than half has been plowed twice. The agricultural association director organized seven people who hauled fertilizer for 12 mu of land (three li away) in five days. The village planted 15 qing of sorghum, and 7 qing of land was cultivated by people pulling the plow. Wang Xiusheng of Nansu Village has 60 mu of land, a family of seven with two laborers and no livestock. They used human-pulled plows and human-powered waterwheels, and all the land has been cultivated and sown, and the wheat fields have also been irrigated for the first time. Zhang Mengchen's group in Beisu Village consists of six poor laborers who cultivated 40 mu of land three times, whereas in previous years, even with livestock, they would only cultivate twice. Xu Heizhuan and two others in Wangsong Village have 47 mu of land, all of which have been plowed twice and are now all planted. After this experience was disseminated at the Sixth and Seventh District village cadre conference, all villages have universally organized human-pulled plows, with everyone reflecting, "Even without livestock, we cannot leave a single mu of land uncultivated."

    元氏六区解决牲口困难普遍组织人拉犁
    【元氏消息】该县六区由于过去敌人抢掠，牲口奇缺，造成春耕生产中的莫大困难。整个六区有土地八万三千一百九十八亩，仅有牲口一千八百七十七头（其中有骡子六十五头、牛一百八十二头、驴一千六百三十头），每个牲口平均须养种地四十三亩（实际上现在没草没料，每头牲口平均不过种地十五亩）。大孔村有地三十三顷，仅有牲口五十五头，每头牲口种地六十亩。该村在张兰和人拉犁推动影响下，有好多户也这样做，共自愿组织了十三个小互助组。李黑子等三家五十亩地，没牲口，连耕带种全部是人拉的。张书子等三人四十亩地，有一半以上耕二过。农会主任组七个人，五天拉了十二亩地的肥料（三里地远）。全村种高粱十五顷，有七顷地是人拉耕种上的。南苏村王修生六十亩地，七口人，两个劳力没牲口，人拉犁、人推水车，地已全部耕种上，麦子地也浇了头水。北苏张梦辰组六个贫雇，四十亩地都耕了三过，往年有牲口也不过耕二过。王宋村徐黑砖等三人，四十七亩地，都耕了二过，现在已全部种上。这个经验，在六七区村干部大会上传播后，各村已普遍组织人拉犁，大家反映“没牲口也不能荒一亩地”。          （王秉章）
