Changping Village Finds Ways to Promote Sowing
　　Establishes Broadcasting Station and Blackboard Newspaper
　　[Huguan News] Changping Village, in the First District, in order to complete sowing ahead of schedule, the head of the Spring Cultivation Committee and others held a meeting on the night of the 17th. They discovered that the promotion and exchange of some labor models and production experiences had not been timely, and that the production levels and sowing conditions of each level and team were not well understood. Everyone unanimously proposed to reorganize the propaganda team from last winter, collect materials from each team, and publish them on the radio and the public blackboard to promote the work. Everyone was very confident and willing to participate in the propaganda team, and automatically registered 18 people to form a propaganda and communication team, and discussed and decided on a meeting system and methods: 1. Hold a meeting every three days (every other night), bringing production materials and cultivation numbers. 2. Exchange production progress, experiences, and various models during the meeting. After everyone listens and evaluates, the editor is responsible for compiling the good ones, the writer posts them on the blackboard, the broadcaster broadcasts them, and the collector listens to feedback and repeatedly praises them. 3. Summarize once every five days, write materials, report to the work district and the district government, or write drafts for experience exchange. In this way, everyone's emotions were even higher, and they all came on time. When everyone was together, they read the newspaper. For example, Ping Baoshun said: "I heard good news in the newspaper again, and I also learned which team and group in our village is doing well in production." The whole village, men, women, old and young, and children are rushing to sow as much land as possible.

　　常平村想办法推动下种
  　建立广播台黑板报
    【壶关消息】一区常平村，为了提前完成下种，春耕委员会组长等在十七日夜开会，发现生产中出现些劳动模范和一些生产经验没有及时推动交流，各级、组的生产程度、下种情况也互不了解，大家一致提出把去冬的宣传股重新整顿一下，各队有些材料收集上广播登大众黑板，推动工作。大家信心很高，都愿参加宣传股，自动报了十八名组成宣传通讯组，并讨论定出了会议制度和办法：一、三天开会一次（隔一夜），来时带些生产材料和耕作数目。二、会议中交流生产进度和经验各种模范等，大家听后评判，择取好的编辑员负责编，写作员登在黑板上，广播员即广播，收集员随时听反映反复表扬。三、每五天总结一次，写成材料，汇报工作小区和区政府，或写成稿子以便交流经验。这样大家情绪更高，按时就都来了，人齐时读报，如平保顺说：“又听了报上的好消息，又了解咱村哪队、组生产好。”全村男女老少儿童正在突击趁垧下种。
