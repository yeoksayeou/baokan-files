　　International Briefs
　　▲The Yugoslav ambassador to the United States recently sent a note to the U.S. side, protesting against U.S. Senator Bridges' open advocacy of setting up underground sabotage organizations in Yugoslavia and other People's Democratic countries in Southeast Europe.
　　▲American imperialism is actively squeezing out British forces in Turkey. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Wilson, visited the Turkish Foreign Ministry at the end of March, believing that the British military delegation in Turkey greatly hindered the U.S. reorganization of the Turkish army and insisted on the cancellation of the delegation. Last summer, ten pro-British generals and two hundred and seventy senior officers in the Turkish army were dismissed at the request of Oliver, the head of the U.S. delegation to Turkey. Now Oliver is determined to replace another three hundred pro-British officers with pro-American ones.
　　▲The American-Dutch Association has been formed in Batavia as a tool for U.S. imperialism to plunder Indonesian resources (oil, rubber, etc.).
　　▲Quirino has succeeded the Philippine traitor Roxas, who died suddenly on the 15th of last month, as the new president of the Philippines. He openly stated that his policy would be to strengthen dependence on the United States.
　　▲The United Nations International Conference on Freedom of the Press, which opened in Geneva on March 23, ended on April 21. Under the manipulation of the United States, the conference rejected many just proposals from representatives of the Soviet Union and other countries by a majority vote, and passed the so-called "General Principles of Freedom of the Press" proposed by representatives of the United States and other countries, which condone rumor-mongering and slander, and spread fascist and new war clamors. The head of the U.S. delegation, Binton, frankly admitted at the meeting that "the point that makes him most unhappy is the prohibition of using deliberately fabricated or distorted information to undermine friendly relations between countries and governments."
　　▲The Soviet government sent a note to Pakistan one day, agreeing to formally establish diplomatic relations between the two countries.
