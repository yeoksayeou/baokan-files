To resolutely, firmly, swiftly, and universally correct deviations and launch a great production movement is the Central Bureau's unwavering policy. Based on this policy, if we examine the current actual situation, we find at least three phenomena that are very unsatisfactory. First, the majority of powerful cadres are still confined to creating experiences in a very small number of democratic land reform experimental villages. Vast areas in a county or district have appeared as blank spaces, where work is without leadership, the thinking of cadres and the masses is chaotic, and those who were wrongly struggled against cannot turn to production. In Ji'nan, many local cadres still focus on carrying out land reform, handing over the responsibility of leading production and correcting deviations to "newly promoted cadres." In this way, the important is put behind the trivial, the greatest demands of the people are ignored, and how can the production movement not fall flat? The second situation is nominally correcting deviations, but in reality, it is still land reform. Two base points are being established in a district, with public party membership and class labeling continuing as before... It is said that this is to create experience, but in some places, it takes half a month just to classify people once. In some places, the result of class classification is that landlords account for 20% of the total number of households. In some places, the rule for class classification is that anyone whose land exceeds twice the average is considered a rich peasant, regardless of exploitative relationships. Our reporters who returned from the north passed through a village in Neiqiu on the 24th, where the public party is now being held, and opinions are being sought from party members. In this way, the work is still land reform, only with a few more base points, making leadership even more unable to control, with mistakes occurring in all directions, having a very bad impact. As a result, a certain correction deviation experimental village in Wu'an recently adopted the method of blocking news, fearing that the "secret" would be leaked by the newspapers. The broad masses generally demand leadership, and many people are becoming impatient. Our newspaper receives countless letters every day questioning why various places do not quickly resolve the immediate difficulties of those who have been wrongly struggled against, according to the instructions of the Central Bureau, so that they can quickly turn to production. We believe that this demand is reasonable and should be given attention by everyone. Third, correcting deviations is not like fighting a fire, putting all efforts into quickly extinguishing it, but rather doing it slowly and cautiously. Some places are quietly correcting: "Give him a little and be done with it, don't publicize it," "afraid of losing face." Some places have even divided wrongly struggled against middle peasants into "hurt middle peasants," "special agent middle peasants," "laboring middle peasants"... supposedly this is called "treating them differently." Some places have shown passive resistance, superficially abolishing control, but actually still restricting actions. Several facts prove that this is mainly due to the lack of determination on the part of the leadership, and the unclear and insufficient understanding of the Central Bureau's policy of correcting deviations. Therefore, in specific implementation, some errors that could have been avoided and should have been avoided have occurred.

The above three phenomena are stumbling blocks to implementing the Central Bureau's instructions on correcting deviations and launching a large-scale production movement, and should be given attention by everyone. The joint meeting of the Taihang District Party Committee and the Prefectural Committee determined the policy of launching a large-scale production movement, and at the same time, eliminating the obstacles to production by compensating middle peasants and resettling landlords and rich peasants is completely correct and completely necessary! We hope that all places will examine, commend good examples of quickly correcting deviations and turning to production, and seriously expose and criticize blind and erroneous practices that deviate from the spirit of the Central Bureau's instructions. We must correct policies and not allow various errors to develop freely. As long as the leadership has clear thinking and a clear mind, personally takes action, the head of the organization is responsible, and there is determination and courage to resolutely stop all land reform base points that cannot be controlled, concentrate the main cadres on the production front, quickly provide wrongly struggled against middle peasants with means of production and means of livelihood, resettle landlords and rich peasants, and allow them to be able to produce and be able to live, then with the unanimous support of all strata, a true large-scale production movement will be led.

### 踢开大生产的绊脚石

　　踢开大生产的绊脚石
    坚决，坚定，迅速，普遍的纠正偏向，掀起一个大生产运动，这是中央局确定不移的方针，根据这一方针去检查一下目前实际状况，我们认为至少有三种现象很难令人满意。第一是大多数强有力干部仍在局限于极少数的民主填补实验村创造经验，在一个县一个区出现了广大空白地区，那里工作无人领导，干部群众思想紊乱，被斗户无法转向生产，冀南至今有很多地方干部仍以搞土改为重点，把领导生产纠偏的责任交给“新提拔起来的干部”，这样，轻重倒置，忽视人民最大要求，生产运动如何不落空？第二种情况是名为纠偏，实则填补，在一个区里搞两个基点，照样是公开党，划阶级等………。据说这是为了创造经验，可是有的地方只划了一次阶级就费了半月之久，有的地方划阶级的结果地主占了总户数百分之廿，有的地方划阶级规定凡是土地超过平均数二倍，不问剥削关系便算做富农，我们从北边回来的记者，他们二十四日路过内邱一村庄，现在正在公开党，给党员提意见。这样一来，工作仍是填补，只是又多了几个基点，领导上更加无力控制，错误百出，影响很坏，以致武安某纠偏实验村最近竟采取了封锁消息的方法，怕报纸泄露“秘密”。广大群众方面普遍要求领导，不少人等得不耐烦。本报一天收到无数函件质问各地为何不按中央局指示迅速解决被斗户的眼前困难，使其迅速转入生产，我们认为这一要求是合理的，应引起大家重视。第三、纠偏不是象救火一样，全力迅速的将其扑灭，而是慢腾腾的，畏首畏尾的去做，有的地方是悄悄的纠：“给他一点算了，不必声张”，“怕丢面子”，有的地方居然把错斗中农又划分为“刺伤中农”，“特务中农”，“劳动中农”，……据说这叫做“分别对待”，有的地方则表现了消极抵抗，表面上取消了管制，实际上还在限制行动，若干事实证明，这主要是由于领导上缺乏决心，对中央局纠偏的方针认识的不明确不充分，因而，在具体贯彻上就发生了若干可以避免应当避免的错误。
    以上三种现象，是贯彻中央局纠偏指示开展大生产运动的绊脚石，应引起大家重视。太行区党委地委联席会议确定了开展大生产运动方针，同时把补偿中农安置地富做生产障碍来扫除这完全正确，完全必要！我们希望各地都来检查一下，表扬迅速纠偏转入生产好的例子，认真揭发批判离开中央局指示精神盲目的错误的做法，一定要端正政策，不能任各种错误自流发展。只要领导上思想明确头脑清醒，亲自动手，首长负责，有决心、有勇气，坚决停止一切无力控制的土改基点，把主要干部都集中到生产阵线上来，迅速补给错斗中农以生产资料生活资料，安置地主富农，让他们能够生产，能够生活，这样就会在各阶层一致拥护下，真正领导一个大生产运动。
