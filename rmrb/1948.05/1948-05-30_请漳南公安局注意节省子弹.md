Please Urge the Zhangnan Public Security Bureau to Save Bullets

　　Recently, the Zhangnan County Public Security Bureau has been firing guns every day, even the machine guns have been fired for three consecutive days. It is said that whenever a leader comes to inspect, they fire a volley of bullets. Each time, at least ten or more bullets are fired. In three days, at least thirty bullets are fired. Each bullet costs four hundred yuan, totaling twelve thousand yuan, enough to buy one dou and six sheng of rice. Each dou is thirty jin, totaling fifty jin. Giving each refugee half a jin of millet (equivalent to the living standard of the people of Lin County) would be more than enough, and could feed a hundred refugees for an entire day. If it is for the pleasure of our cadres to fire guns at will (one afternoon, six more bullets were fired separately, no idea whether it was rifles or machine guns), it is best for the leading comrades to examine themselves and stop it. Currently, there are at least fifty refugees begging for food in Zhangnan.

　　请漳南公安局注意节省子弹
    最近漳南县公安局每天打枪，光机关枪就连打了三天。据说，有领导人来看，就打一排子弹。每次至少打十来粒子弹以上。三天至少打三十粒。每粒四百元，合一万二千元，买米一斗六升上下。每斗三十市斤，总合五十斤。给难民每人半斤小米（等于林县人民生活水平）吃不完，可养一百难民一整天。如果是为了我们干部快乐而随意放枪（一天下午又单放六粒，不知步枪机枪），最好请领导同志自己检查一下停止才好。现在漳南难民讨饭至少有五十人。
