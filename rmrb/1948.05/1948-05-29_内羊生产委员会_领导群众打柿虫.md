　　Neiyang Production Committee
  　Leads the Masses to Fight Persimmon Caterpillars
    [Xingtai News] The persimmon and chestnut trees in the villages of the Ninth District are currently suffering severely from leaf-eating caterpillars. In Neiyang Village, 70% of the trees are infested, and inspections show that an average of five out of every hundred trees have been completely eaten. On the evening of the 28th day of the third lunar month, the village production committee convened a mass meeting to discuss solutions. Li Chengzhen, a cowherd, said, "I saw the most in Hetaogou and Niangou, where the leaves have been eaten bare. We rely entirely on fruit trees here, so we must take action." Everyone suggested that men, women, young and old should work together to catch them. Finally, it was decided that the whole village would organize four brigades based on mutual aid teams, led by their captains, to catch the caterpillars. The caterpillars' characteristic is that they climb the trees at night to eat and descend during the day to crawl under stones. The method is to put stone slabs on the tree roots and catch them at midday every day, burning those that drill into stone holes. In two mornings, twelve women caught two dou and eight sheng, and the whole village caught a total of two shi, five dou, and nine sheng. Women like Li Sini personally took the lead and led others, catching them with great enthusiasm. (Ninth District Working Group)

　　内羊生产委员会
  　领导群众打柿虫
    【邢台消息】九区各村的柿树和栗树，现在发生毛虫吃叶子，非常厉害。内羊村即有百分之七十的树有了虫子，据检查平均一百棵树有五棵被吃光了。该村生产委员会，在阴历三月二十八日晚上召集群众会，让大家讨论怎样办。放牛工人李成珍说：“我见到核桃沟、年沟最多，那里把树叶都吃光了，咱这里全靠果木树，不打可不行。”大家提出要男女老少一齐下手捉，最后大家讨论出全村以互助组组织四个大队，由队长领导去捉。虫子的特点是黑夜上树吃，白天下来爬到石头底。打法是把石板盖到树根上，每天晌午打，钻到石窟窿的用火烧。两晌午十二个妇女即打了二斗八，全村共打二石五斗九。妇女李四妮等亲自动手带领别的人，打的非常有劲。（九区工作组）
