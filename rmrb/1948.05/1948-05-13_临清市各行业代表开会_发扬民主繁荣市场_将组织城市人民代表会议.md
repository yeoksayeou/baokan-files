    [Jinan News] To welcome the Border Region Industry and Commerce Conference on the 15th of this month, Linqing City held a forum for factory owners and shop owners, and a forum for workers and shop assistants in Linqing City on the 25th and 26th of last month, respectively, to review industry and commerce policies and listen to the opinions of various industries on industry and commerce. At the forum for factory owners and shop owners, more than 60 representatives from various industries spoke enthusiastically, putting forward the following opinions based on the situation in Linqing: First, in terms of industrial and commercial management, there is inconsistency across different regions, and policies are not unified. Currently, Linqing City has a cotton monopoly, while Dezhou requires a tax of 10% and a deposit to export. Last year, Linqing City strictly managed cotton, but the Sixth Special Administrative Office of JiluYu allowed exports from Guoyao. The price of cotton in Linqing City was 80,000 yuan, while in Guoyao it was 150,000 yuan. Currently, Linqing City prohibits the entry of white and brown sugar, tea, pepper, and anise, while Dezhou and Liaocheng allow their entry. Recently, the red cotton and monopolized cotton that were approved for export here were seized upon arrival in JiluYu. If the goods don't arrive and the draft is honored, they will have to compensate for the losses, causing merchants to suffer. The procedures at the Industry and Commerce Bureau are complicated, and the office hours are not fixed. Sometimes opportunities are missed due to slow order processing. The procedure for canceling the guarantee at the Industry and Commerce Bureau is also difficult. Sometimes it is difficult to cancel the order because the goods are not recognized. The liquor monopoly of the Industry and Commerce Bureau (including retail sales) makes it difficult for small liquor vendors to make a living. The department store exchange sells a large quantity of foreign cloth from Shijiazhuang in retail sizes, making it difficult for some small cloth stalls to survive. Second, in terms of levying burdens, the assessment is based on streets, not industries, so there are many unfair situations of being too light or too heavy. The assessment time is too long, with the assessment alone taking two months. During the assessment in Cheying Street, 120 meetings were held, which greatly affected operations. Moreover, because merchants are unwilling to reveal the true situation, they are unwilling to tell the truth even if they lose money, fearing loss of credit, and they are afraid of too much publicity if they make money, so they simply accept whatever assessment is made. Some shops have collapsed because of excessive burdens. Calculating the profit from inventory, burdens are levied before the money is even earned, causing shareholders to suffer. If the capital is large and the level is raised, it is bound to be broken down into smaller units and the operation scaled down. The transaction commission for grain stores is 2%, of which 1% is turned over for tax, and then burdens are levied again, which is equivalent to paying double taxes. The income of grain stores is only 60%, which is not enough to maintain a living. Third, the wage issue. The wages of general workers, shop assistants, and apprentices are too high, and they do not abide by the rules. Cart drivers are poor people, and merchants should take care of them in principle, but there should be a regulation on the price, and it is impossible to calculate if they ask for money without limits. The wood industry reflects that the wages for doing "package" work increase three times a month, and the cost of making a wooden bucket is 1,500 yuan, leaving no profit after wages. An apprentice requires at least 100 catties of millet per month, but he can't do much work. In the past, apprentices only received 5 strings of Beijing money a year, which was not even enough to buy clothes, which was certainly wrong; but now a flour milling worker earns 300 catties of millet per month. With such high wages, shop assistants still do not work hard, and they cannot be dismissed. When there are guests and the shop assistant is asked to serve them, not only do they not move, but they also use equality as an excuse to argue, and the shop owner does not dare to speak. Fourth, individual street cadres damage the interests of merchants. For example, Gu Lou Street invested 300,000 yuan in Tongmao Oil Mill, taking 60% of the profits in cash, leaving the outstanding debts to the original owner. Later, the oil mill borrowed 800,000 yuan and earned 1.7 million yuan, but the profits were still distributed as before. Fifth, the government often pushes things to merchants. For example, when the troops come to look for bran, the Finance Department pushes it to the flour milling industry to be responsible, and the flour mills are scattered all over the city. As a result, the chairman of the flour milling industry runs around, affecting his own production. Sixth, on the issue of loans, everyone unanimously felt that the amount of bank loans was small and the terms were short. For example, merchants from Taoyuan Street who run to Tianjin need more than 40 days to return, but the loan is limited to one month, which is not enough to turn around. Seventh, the grain stores propose that in order to regulate grain, they request the bank to allocate funds to establish a mortgage warehouse, so that the bank's inventory and regulation of grain can be combined to stabilize grain prices. Eighth, several merchants were wrongly confiscated and requested to be returned. Some troops forcibly buy things and request to stop this.
    After two days of forums, Director Wang of the Administrative Office finally addressed everyone, pointing out that in the future, people's representative conferences should be organized, and everyone should participate in the leadership, with workers, citizens, small merchants, and large merchants all electing representatives. In the past, mass movements harmed industry and commerce, but now they have the right to elect, recall, and make suggestions. The government can study and adopt the opinions put forward by everyone to better develop industry and commerce. The trade union should check whether the wages are high, and if they are too high, they must be reduced. The equality between workers and shop owners is equality in political and personal terms. In terms of work, there must be a division of labor and certain responsibilities. Workers and shop assistants must strictly abide by labor discipline, but it is not to restore the old feudal system. Industrial and commercial enterprises that were struggled against in the past will be returned unconditionally. Only the industrial and commercial property of true traitors, spies, and despots can be confiscated by the government. Other industrial and commercial enterprises will be protected. The municipal government should conduct inspections and handle them household by household. If they cannot be returned, other methods will be found to compensate. The burden assessment should be fair, and the opinions of merchants must be carefully adopted. Those who lose money can be exempted from paying, and newly established factories can be exempted from paying for one, two, or even three years.
    On the evening of the 26th, a forum for workers and shop assistants was held, attended by more than 60 worker leaders, who reviewed the past work of the trade union based on the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital. First, the freight rates for cart drivers were too high, which reduced the inflow of goods from outside, resulting in less money being earned. Several responsible comrades from the shop assistants' union reviewed that the trade union did not deal with shop assistants who made mistakes in a timely manner, but insisted on not allowing dismissal (government decrees stipulate that dismissal is not allowed without reason), believing that this was "standing firm." As a result, workers lacked discipline, were free and undisciplined, and acted arbitrarily. Some shop owners pretended to be sick and had to close down, resulting in their own unemployment. In addition, problems such as excessive wages in other industries such as shoemaking and hairdressing, which affected business, and the poor attitude of workers and shop assistants at work were also reviewed. Finally, Director Wang of the Administrative Office also addressed the meeting, calling on everyone to discuss whether the wages were high, and if they were really high, they could discuss lowering them, or they could calculate the accounts with the merchants and discuss them. The trade union should represent the interests of the majority, and those who are not good should be educated. Those who repeatedly refuse to be educated can be expelled from the trade union, and dismissal is allowed. He asked workers and shop assistants to work hard and jointly develop industry and commerce.

    临清市各行业代表开会
    发扬民主繁荣市场
    将组织城市人民代表会议
    管理不一致
    政令不统一
    工人店员工资太高
    商业贷款限期太短
    工人店员不守纪律，允许解雇
    【冀南消息】为迎接本月十五日边区工商业会议，临清市在上月二十五、二十六两日先后召开工厂厂主、商店店主座谈会和临清市工人店员座谈会，检讨工商业政策，听取各行业对工商业意见。在工厂主和商店主座谈会上，各行业代表六十多人热烈发言，根据临清情况，提出以下各方面的意见：第一、在工商管理上，各地不一致，政令不统一。现在临市是棉花专卖，德州是征税一成押金才能出口。去年临市棉花严格管理，冀鲁豫六专署郭窑却准许出口，临市棉价八万元，郭窑十五万元。现在临市禁止红白糖、茶叶、胡椒、元茴入境，德州、聊城却都允许入境。最近经这里准许出口的红棉和专卖的棉花，到冀鲁豫就被扣住，这样货到不了，顶了汇票，就得赔偿人家的损失，使商人吃亏。工商局手续复杂，办公没有一定时间，有时因起单慢而耽误了机会。工商局撤保手续也很困难，有时因认不清货而难销单。工商局的烧酒专卖（零的也专卖），使小酒贩难以生活。百货交易所从石家庄运来大批洋布也卖零尺，使一些小布摊难以维持。第二、在征收负担上，评议时以街道为单位，不是以行业为单位，所以发生很多轻重不公的现象。评议时间太长，光评议就用了两个月，车营街评议时，开了一百二十次会，影响经营很大。并且因为商人不愿暴露真实情况，赔了钱也不愿说出实话，怕失去信用，赚了钱怕风声太大，所以评议多少就多少，有的商店就因为负担过高垮了台。计算存货得利，钱还没赚到手就征了负担，使集股的吃了亏。资本大了，级数提高，势必化整为零，缩小经营。粮行交易佣金共二分，其中一分上解交税，又征负担，结果等于交了双税。粮行收入只有百分之六十，不足维持生活。第三、工资问题。一般工人、店员、学徒工资太高，工作不守规矩。大把车工人是穷人，商人按理应当照顾，可是价目应当有个规定，没边的要钱就没法算帐。木业方面反映：做“包件”活的一个月长三次工资，一个木桶的工价一千五百元，除了工资没赚的。一个学徒起码每月一百斤小米，又做不了什么活。过去学徒只一年五吊京钱，还不够穿衣的，这当然不对；可是现在一个磨面工人每月三百斤小米。这样大的工资，店员还不好好干，又不能解雇，有了客人叫店员招待，不但不动，还借口平等讲道理，店东就不敢说话了。第四、个别街干部损害商人利益。如古楼街在同茂油坊入股三十万元，分六成，要现钱，把外欠帐留给本主，后来人家贷款八十万元，赚了一百七十万元，也照样分红。第五、政府有事常往商家推。如部队来找麸子，财政科推给了磨面业负责，磨坊又散遍全市，结果面磨业主席跑过来跑过去，影响自己生产。第六、在贷款上，大家一致感到银行贷款数目少，期限短。如桃园街跑天津的行商，需要四十多天才能回来，贷款限定一个月，根本周转不开。第七、粮行提出，为了调剂粮食，请求银行拨款建立抵押仓库，使银行的库存和调剂粮食结合，平稳粮价。第八、有几家商号被错没收了，要求退还。有些部队强制买东西，要求停止。
    经过两天座谈，最后行署王主任向大家讲话，指出今后要组织人民代表会，大家的事大家做，工人、市民、小商人、大商人都选举代表参加领导，过去群运中伤害了工商业，同样有选举权、罢免权和提意见的权利。大家提的意见，政府可以研究采纳，更好的发展工商业，工会应当检查工资是不是高，过高必须减低，工人与店主平等，是在政治上人格上的平等，在工作上一定要有分工、有一定的责任，工人店员要很好的遵守劳动纪律，但不是恢复旧的封建制度。对于街干，个别坏的政府要撤职，取消街干扣人、罚人的权限，保证大家的民主权利。过去斗争的工商业，无条件退回，只有真正的汉奸、特务、恶霸的工商业财产才能由政府没收，别的工商业一概保护，市政府应进行检查，挨户处理，不能退回的，另外设法补偿。负担搞的公平，商人意见一定好好采纳，赔钱的可以不拿，新开办的工厂，一年甚至二年三年免征负担。
    二十六日晚上召开工人店员座谈会，到会工人领袖六十多人，根据劳资两利的方针，对过去工会工作进行了检讨。一是大把车工人运费太大，影响外来的货减少，结果还是自己少挣了钱吃了亏。店员公会几个负责同志检讨，对犯错误的店员、公会没有及时处理，只是坚持不准解雇（政府法令是不得无故解雇），认为这就是“立场”。所以闹的工人没有纪律，自由散漫，随便行动。闹的有些东家假推有病，非关门不可，结果他也失了业。此外，如做鞋、理发等其他行业工资过高，影响营业的问题，以及工人店员工作时态度不好等等，也都作了检讨。最后行署王主任也在会上讲话，号召大家讨论工资是不是高，如真高的可以讨论降低，也可以和商人算算帐商量商量。工会要代表大多数人的利益，对个别不好的要进行教育，屡教不改的工会可以开除，允许人家解雇。他要求工人店员好好工作，共同发展工商业。
