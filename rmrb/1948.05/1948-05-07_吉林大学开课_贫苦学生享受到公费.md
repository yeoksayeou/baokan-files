Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: Jilin University, the highest institution of learning in Jilin Province, officially reopened on the 15th of last month. The university was formed by merging the Chiang-run "Changbai Normal College" and "Yongji University Preparatory Class," and is divided into three colleges: Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Arts. As of the 11th of this month, more than 530 students have registered. During the occupation by the Chiang bandits, all the school buildings were occupied by them. The campus was filled with bunkers, fortifications, and trenches. Classroom windows were stacked with bricks, most of the desks and chairs were burned, and students were often forced to dig fortifications all day long. After the liberation of Jilin, the democratic government actively prepared for the resumption of classes. With the joint efforts of male and female students, the fortifications on the campus have now been completely leveled, gradually restoring the original appearance. When our army withdrew from Jilin two years ago, professors and students of the original Jilin University secretly stored various books and documents, which were secretly circulated regularly. Now all the books have been taken out and a library has been established, which began lending on the 11th of last month. Some of the professors and lecturers who taught at Changbai Normal College and Yongji University Preparatory Class have been rehired by Jilin University. The school provides public funding for impoverished students and students whose families are in the Chiang-controlled areas. Students from landlord and rich peasant families who are currently in need are also given assistance to enable them to continue their studies. The school also held a formal opening ceremony on the 24th of last month, the anniversary of the founding of Jilin University by the democratic government two years ago, to commemorate and celebrate.

　　吉林大学开课
  　贫苦学生享受到公费
    【新华社东北四日电】吉林省最高学府吉林大学，于上月十五日正式复校开学。该校系由蒋办“长白师范学院”及“永吉大学先修班”合并改组而成，共分社会科学、自然科学、艺术三院，截至本月十一日止，报到学生已达五百三十余人。该校在蒋匪侵占时期，全部校舍均被蒋匪占据，校园遍设地堡、工事、交通壕，课室窗口堆满砖头，桌椅大半被烧，学生并常被驱使终日挖筑工事。此次吉林解放后，民主政府即积极筹备复课，并经男女同学一齐动手，现校内工事已完全平毁，渐次恢复原状。前年我军撤出吉林后，原吉大教授和同学曾将各种书籍文件秘密贮藏起来，经常秘密传阅，现全部图书均已取出，成立图书馆，于上月十一日开始借阅。原在长白师范学院及永吉大学先修班执教之教授讲师，部分已继续为吉大聘任，该校对贫苦学生及家在蒋管区的学生均予以公费待遇，对原出身于地主富农家庭的子弟，如目前有困难者亦予以帮助，使其继续求学。该校并于上月二十四日即前年民主政府创办吉大时的开学日补行正式开学典礼，以示纪念及庆祝。
