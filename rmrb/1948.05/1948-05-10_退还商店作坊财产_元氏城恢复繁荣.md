　　Returning Property to Shops and Workshops
　　Yuanshi City Restores Prosperity

　　[Yuanshi News] After our army recovered Yuanshi County on December 3rd of last year, due to a lack of understanding of the Central Committee's policy on industry and commerce, many businesses were confiscated or placed under trusteeship. The county confiscated or managed on behalf of the owners nine businesses including the Fushengheng and two other cotton mills, an oil shop, and the Chunhetang Pharmacy. The villages confiscated and closed eight businesses, including the Juxingxiang Oil Mill, the Guangjuchang Pickled Vegetable Shop, and the Anxichun Soap Workshop. The Donggeng Weaving Factory, which originally supported over a hundred people, and the Yizhongcheng Flower Shop, along with six others, also fled for fear of struggle and confiscation. For more than two months after entering the city, businesses on the main street were closed. The few that were open only put out small stalls to maintain appearances. The market was desolate, affecting the supply of daily necessities for farmers. Merchants and citizens generally held the idea that "the Communist Party loves the poor and struggles against anyone with money," which greatly limited the development of industry and commerce. Although relatively deep policy propaganda and organizational education work among merchants had been carried out two or three months later, there was no substantial progress because there was no practical action. Although the number of open businesses increased (those that had not been liquidated but were closed and not operating), the fundamental problem was not solved, and industry and commerce did not improve. At the end of March, the county committee made a relatively deep self-criticism and decided to first return all the medicines, grain, and furniture of the Chunhetang Pharmacy, totaling more than 16,000 jin of medicine, worth more than 10 million yuan, and more than 1,000 jin of grain. The detained manager, Liu Zhongzhen, was also released and allowed to continue his business. Then, the problem of the Juxingxiang Oil Mill confiscated by Li Renzhuang Village was resolved. Except for the six shi of grain stored in the oil mill, which was taken to the village for temporary safekeeping, all other property related to industry and commerce was returned to the original owners, who immediately reopened their doors for business. These two businesses were very satisfied after receiving the returned property and expanded their propaganda, mobilizing closed businesses to open. Liu Zhongzhen said happily: "The Communist Party and the democratic government speak the truth, and they do what they say. I must run the pharmacy well in the future and serve the masses." An employee of the Juxingxiang Oil Mill also actively introduced other businesses to the government to negotiate opening for business.

    After the county committee and the democratic government issued the decision to return the property of the shops, several villages, including Hantai and Zhao Tong, quickly returned the property of four wrongly struggled businesses. The government immediately convened a general meeting of all merchants in the town, with more than 400 people, reviewed past mistakes, and expounded the future policy on industry and commerce; at the same time, it announced the unified use of both Border Region currency and Hebei banknotes, and the cancellation of road passes, which greatly facilitated the merchants, especially in the border areas of the two regions. The merchants were all beaming with joy. After the meeting, everyone said: "The government really protects industry and commerce, and we must do business well." Old Zhou said: "Even a big business like Chunhetang has been returned, so let's be bold with our small businesses. There will be no more mistakes." Several businesses that had fled before and after the siege of the city also said: "If we had known this earlier, we would not have left no matter what. What a great loss! We can only work hard to compensate in the future."

    In less than half a month, sixteen businesses that had fled in the past and businesses that had been wrongly struggled came to the county to find solutions. The county committee and the democratic government are prepared to resolutely return the property. In addition to quickly solving the problems and allowing them to open for business, they also apologized to the wrongly struggled businesses. Only those with shares held by traitors would be strictly distinguished.

    In the month of April alone, according to incomplete statistics, 53 businesses had been restored and newly opened: eleven cotton mills, six flour mills, eleven restaurants, eight miscellaneous food shops, five grocery stores, four flour mills, two small woodworking factories, two oil mills, two cart shops, one ironware shop, and one pharmacy. Together with the previous 348 (including larger small vendors), there are a total of 401 in the whole town, and they are all working very hard now. The front of each door is cleaned spotlessly. People who come to the city say: "Yuanshi City has changed a lot compared to a month ago." Whenever there is a market, the streets are crowded with people. In the past, no one asked about the houses in the city, but now people are vying to occupy them. Some merchants are asking for loans to expand their businesses. The merchants in the South Gate are also asking for loans to repair their storefronts. (Wang Bingzhang, Zhi Shichang)

　　退还商店作坊财产
  　元氏城恢复繁荣
    【元氏消息】去年十二月三号我军收复元氏县城后，由于对中央工商业政策不认识，曾先后没收和代管了好多商号。由县没收代管的有复胜恒等三个花坊、油店、春和堂药铺等九家。由村没收封闭的有聚合祥油坊、广聚昌咸菜铺、安喜春肥皂作坊等八家。原来能维持百余人生活的董更织工厂，和义众成花店等六家，也因害怕斗争没收而逃跑了。入城后两个多月中，大街上商号关门闭户。有几户开门，也是摆小摊支应门面。市面萧条，影响农民日用生活必需品供给。商人市民当中普遍存在着“共产党爱穷人，谁有钱就斗争谁”的思想，使工商业的发展受到莫大限制。二三个月后，虽曾进行了比较深刻的政策宣传及商人中的一些组织教育工作，但因为没有实际行动，故虽增加了一些开门的商号（没有被清算而关门不营业的），但仍没有解决基本问题，工商业无起色。三月下旬的县委会上，作了比较深刻的检讨，并决定首先退还春和堂药铺全部药品、粮食、家具，计有药一万六千余斤，价值千余万元，粮千余斤。并把被扣的经理刘忠珍放回，使其继续营业。接着又解决了李仁庄村没收聚合祥油坊问题。除将寄存到油坊内的六石粮拉到村中暂为保管外，其他有关工商业部分财物全部退还原主，马上开门经营。这两个商号在接收了退还财产后，感到很满意，并扩大宣传，动员停业的商号开门。刘忠珍很高兴的说：“共产党与民主政府就是讲真理，说出啥就要作出啥，我今后一定要把药房办好，为群众服务。”聚合祥油坊的一个伙计也积极介绍其他商号到政府谈判开门营业问题。
    县委与民主政府退还商号财产的决定下达后，很快就有韩台、赵同等几个村退还了四户错斗商号。政府当即召开了全城镇四百余人的全体商人大会，检讨了过去错误，阐述了今后对工商业的方针；同时宣布边币与冀钞统一混合使用，路条取消，又给商人以很大便利，特别是两个边区交界地区，商人都喜气洋洋。会后大家说：“政府真保障工商业了，咱们可得好好干买卖。”老周说：“春和堂那样大的买卖还退还，象咱这小买卖放大胆干吧。再不会有错。”攻城前后跑了的几家商号也说：“早知如此，说什么也不走，这受多大损失！今后只有好好干来补偿罢。”
    不到半月时间，过去逃亡的商号及错斗的商号来县找解决问题的就有十六家，县委和民主政府都准备坚决退还。除迅速解决问题使其开门营业外，并向错斗商号承认错误，只有有汉奸股份的，才严格分清。
    仅四月份一个月的光景，据不完全的统计，恢复和新开门的商号就有五十三家：计有弹轧花坊十一家，磨面六家，饭馆十一家，卖杂食八家，杂货铺五家，粉坊四家，小木工厂二家，油坊二家，车子铺二家，铁货铺一家，药铺一家，连过去的三百四十八家（较大的小摊贩在内），全城镇共达四百零一家，现在都干的很起劲。各个门柜前边都打扫的干干净净。到城的人都说：“元氏城比一个月前大大变了样子。”一遇集市，各街道即人群拥挤。过去城内房子没人问，现在房子是争着占。有的商人为了扩大经营，纷纷要求贷款。南关的门面座商还要求贷款修门面。（王秉章、智世昌）
