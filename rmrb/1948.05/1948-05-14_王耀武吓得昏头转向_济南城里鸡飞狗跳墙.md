Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. According to a Jinan dispatch recently carried in a Nanjing Chiang Kai-shek bandit newspaper: The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Jinan are at the end of their rope and are acting perversely. Since the disastrous defeat of the bandit province chairman Wang Yaowu in the Laiwu Campaign last year, the citizens have mocked him, saying, "He Siyuan drinks water and doesn't think of the source, Li Yannian's 'extending years' is not beneficial to planning, and Wang Yaowu's 'showing off military prowess' does not display any power." When the People's Liberation Army launched an offensive along the Jiaoji Railway, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops fled into Jinan one after another, seizing civilian houses everywhere, causing chaos and turmoil. In a panic, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits first loaded their families and gold bars onto airplanes or "southbound trains" and sent them to Nanjing, and ordered Qilu University in the city to move south. When the People's Liberation Army advanced westward along the Jiaoji Road, directly threatening Jinan, the Jinan Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities ordered the Fourth Garrison Headquarters to transfer 400 merchant vehicles to withdraw various agencies from the commercial port area outside the city into the city. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit vehicles crashed around, killing twelve innocent people in one day. The bandit defense commander Li Xingcun took this opportunity to extort merchants, forcibly ordering Chengfeng and other four flour mills to hand over 2,600 bags of flour. After the merchants were forced to hand over the flour, the next day the Chiang Kai-shek bandits shamelessly published in the newspaper: "Flour companies 'donate' flour." Bandit Li also forcibly ordered various schools to organize so-called "student comfort teams" to go to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops for "comfort," and performers and singers were also forced to participate. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek "Mobilization Headquarters" also forced citizens to build fortifications, providing unpaid labor, and those who didn't go had to pay "substitute money" of more than 100,000 yuan per day. All the houses near the city wall were demolished, and even the Central Primary School was not spared. The citizens of Jinan rose up to resist. More than 800 residents in the South Gate area, led by Zhou Wanshan and 14 others, went to the Chiang Kai-shek municipal government to petition, demanding that the demolition of houses be stopped, but the Chiang Kai-shek bandits suppressed the demonstrators with four machine guns, and the houses were still demolished.

    王耀武吓得昏头转向
    济南城里鸡飞狗跳墙
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据南京蒋匪某报近载济南通讯供称：济南蒋匪日暮途穷，倒行逆施。匪省主席王耀武自去年莱芜战役惨败后，市民即嘲笑说：“何思源饮水不思源，李延年‘延年’不益筹，王耀武‘耀武’不扬威。”当解放军沿胶济线发动攻势时，蒋匪部队纷纷逃入济南，到处抢占民房，弄得鸡飞狗走，蒋匪在慌乱中首先就把家属和金条装上飞机或“南下列车”送往南京，并令该市齐鲁大学南迁。当解放军沿胶济路西进，直逼济南之际，济南蒋匪当局即令第四兵监部调来四百辆商车，把城外商埠区各机关撤入城内，蒋匪汽车横冲直撞，竟在一天之内压死了十二个无辜人民。匪防守司令李杏村更借此向商户敲榨，强令成丰等四个面粉厂交出二千六百袋面粉，商户被迫缴出面粉后，第二天蒋匪竟无耻地在报上登出：“面粉公司‘捐助’面粉”。李匪并强令各学校组织所谓“学生慰劳队”分赴蒋匪部队“慰劳”，艺人歌女亦被强迫参加。同时蒋匪“动员指挥部”又强迫市民修筑工事，作无代价劳役，没人的每天也要出“代金”十余万元。城墙附近民房全被拆除，甚至中心小学亦未幸免。济南市民奋起反抗，南门一带居民八百余人由周万山等十四人率领，赴蒋匪市府请愿，要求停拆房屋，但蒋匪却以四挺机枪镇压示威者，民房仍被拆除。
