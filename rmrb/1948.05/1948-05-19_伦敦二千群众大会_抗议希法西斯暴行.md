Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Reports from all sides: The movement protesting the atrocities of the Greek puppet's massacres continues to develop. A protest rally of two thousand people was held in Montague Square, London, on the 9th. Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered a speech stating, "The best representatives of the Greek people are being massacred, and this is all caused by British and American policies." The conference unanimously resolved to demand that the government immediately stop the atrocities of the Greek puppets. A mass protest rally was also held in Manchester. The British government and the Greek puppet embassy have received a flood of protest letters. In addition to protesting, the Central Bureau of the Polish Writers' Union also demanded the release of Greek democratic leader Kitsikis. The Danish Parliament recently discussed a draft protest submitted by the Communist parliamentary group. The Danish Foreign Ministry protested to the Greek puppet government, stating, "The news of the Greek authorities massacring democrats has aroused the concern of the Danish people." On the 10th, Norwegian writers and poets angrily condemned "the Greek fascists for harming patriots using Hitler's method of massacring hostages." The Philadelphia Inquirer in the United States declared, "These executions have aroused a wave of anger in the United States." The Afternoon newspaper said that the terror of the Greek fascists is a massacre carried out with "American machine guns firing American bullets."
