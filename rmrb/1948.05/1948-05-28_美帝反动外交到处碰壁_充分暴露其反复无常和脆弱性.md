　　American Imperialist Reactionary Diplomacy Bumping into Walls Everywhere
  　Fully Exposing Its Fickleness and Fragility
    Stalin's public reply on the 17th to Wallace's open letter is a historically significant major event in international political relations this week. Stalin said: "I believe that in the recent political documents aimed at consolidating peace, promoting international cooperation, and ensuring democracy, Mr. Wallace, the third-party presidential candidate in the United States, wrote the most important open letter... The great importance of this open letter lies in that it... proposes a concrete program for a peaceful resolution of differences between Soviet-American relations." Stalin pointed out: "People may agree or disagree with Mr. Wallace's program, but one thing is beyond doubt: no politician who cares about the cause of peace and cooperation between countries can ignore this program, because it reflects the people's hopes and desires for strengthening peace; and it will undoubtedly win the support of millions of ordinary people." The Soviet government, which has always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, naturally welcomes Wallace's proposal of this program. Stalin announced: "As far as the Soviet government is concerned, it believes that Wallace's program can serve as a good and effective basis for seeking such an agreement and developing international cooperation."
    Wallace's open letter was issued on the 11th and is the most important reaction caused by the publication of the exchange of notes on US-Soviet relations in Moscow last week. Wallace's desire for US-Soviet friendship concentrates the true demands of the broad masses of the American people. This fact not only greatly hit the war atmosphere created by the large-scale artificial war clamor of American reactionaries, but also powerfully exposed the "paper tiger" prototype of American reactionaries behind the "war" smoke screen. Stalin's reply aroused unanimous cheers in peaceful public opinion all over the world. As the Czech Rude Pravo said: "Stalin's reply is welcomed by hundreds of millions of ordinary people who hope for peace." It must be pointed out that it has a greater impact on the United States because Stalin's reply enables the American people to realize more profoundly in concrete experience that the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy is consistent with the American people's broad desire for peace. The American people will be more able to appreciate the truth that Wallace said: "The threat to American security comes from Washington, not elsewhere." This will strengthen the American people's understanding, strengthen the unity of the American and Soviet people, and strengthen the American people's confidence and strength in the struggle for peace. It is also a great encouragement to the people of other countries in the imperialist camp.
    The American reactionaries, represented by the likes of Truman and Marshall, know on the one hand that war intimidation cannot save the crisis of American imperialism, and on the other hand, before ending the gamble of war intimidation, they intend to use diplomatic tricks in a bluff, dreaming of putting the Soviet Union in a passive position, or deceiving the Soviet Union in some secret negotiations, in order to gain some advantages in their aggressive diplomacy and reactionary domestic policies. However, this trick was thwarted by the Soviet Union's honest and firm peace policy. Molotov's note and Stalin's statement hit the reactionaries' vital points again and again, causing them to fall into the traps they had set themselves.
    Simultaneous with the peace movement aroused by the exchange of letters between Stalin and Wallace, the domestic democratic movement in the United States against the Mundt anti-communist bill is also on the rise. On the 13th, a conference of representatives of 2.5 million members of the AFL, CIO, and railway labor unions was held in Washington, calling for the rejection of the reactionary bill. Representatives of all levels and groups of the mass movement against the Mundt Bill are flocking to "march on Washington" from all over the country (TASS). The US House of Representatives has passed the reactionary bill, which will undoubtedly educate more American people to recognize the fascist face of American financial groups and strengthen the unity of progressive forces.
    Another noteworthy event this week is the establishment of the State of Israel in the Palestine region. According to the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the partition of Palestine on November 29, 1947, the new Jewish state, named "Israel," was proclaimed on the 14th. The wish of the Jewish people, who have been wandering for two thousand years without a homeland and have been subjected to exclusion, insults, and massacres, to establish a Jewish state has begun to come true. After the establishment of the State of Israel, it has been recognized by the United States, the Soviet Union, and countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, while the United Kingdom has stated that it will not recognize it. In its note of recognition, the Soviet Union stated: "It hopes that the independent state created by the Jewish people will be beneficial to the cause of consolidating peace and security in Palestine and the Near East." The Soviet Union's position on the dispute between the Arabs and Jews in Palestine has always been consistent. It believes that in today's situation, only the implementation of the partition of Arabs and Jews is the way out for the two Arab and Jewish nations and the entire Near East peace. In contrast, the US government's position is fickle. The US government expressed its support for partition at the United Nations General Assembly in November 1947, but suddenly overturned its previous decision in March this year and advocated trusteeship. And after the Jews announced the establishment of the State of Israel this time, the United States was the first to recognize it. According to an analysis in the Czech newspaper Rude Pravo: Truman's actions "were partly to prevent the loss of votes of American Jews in the presidential election, and partly to influence the government of the new Jewish state." The fickleness of the United States on the issue of Jewish statehood fully illustrates that, like British imperialism, its means may often be different, but their purpose is only to control Middle East oil resources and military bases, and it has nothing in common with the Soviet Union's sincere policy of assisting small and weak nations.

　　美帝反动外交到处碰壁
  　充分暴露其反复无常和脆弱性
    斯大林十七日对华菜士公开信的公开答复，是本周国际政治关系中极富历史意义的重大事件。斯大林说：“我认为在最近以巩固和平、促进国际合作与确保民主为其目的的政治文件中，美国第三党总统候选人华菜士先生的公开信，是最重要的文件……这对公开信的极大重要性，在于它……给和平解决苏美关系间之分歧提了一个具体的纲领”。斯大林指出：“人们可以同意或者不同意华莱士先生的纲领，但是有一件事无论如何是毫无疑问的，即任何关心和平事业与各国间合作的政治家，都不可能无视这个纲领，因为它反映着人民对加强和平的希望与意愿；并且无疑为博得千百万老百姓的拥护。”始终坚持着和平外交政策的苏联政府，对于华莱士提出这个纲领来，当然表示欢迎。斯大林宣布说：“就苏联政府来说，它认为华莱士的纲领可以作为一个良好而有效的基础，用以求取这种协议与发展国际合作。”
    华莱士的公开信是十一日发出的，它是上周莫斯科公布美苏关系换文之后所引起的最重要的一个反应。华莱士关于美苏友好的愿望集中表现了美国广大人民的真正要求。这一事实，不但大大打击了美国反动派大规模地人为的战争叫嚣所造成的战争空气，并且有力地暴露了美国反动派在“战争”烟幕后面的“纸老虎”原形。斯大林的复信在全世界各地的和平舆论中，引起了一致的欢呼。正如捷共真理报所说：“斯大林的答复，受到亿万希望和平的老百姓的欢迎。”必须指出：它对于美国的影响更为巨大，因为斯大林这个复信，使美国人民在具体经验中更加深刻地认识到苏联的和平外交政策，是与美国广大人民的和平愿望一致的。美国广大人民将更能体会到华莱士所说过的一个真理：“对于美国安全的威胁是来自华盛顿，而不是其他地方。”这就会加强美国人民的认识，加强美苏人民的团结，加强美国人民为和平奋斗的信心与力量。对于帝国主义阵营内的其他各国人民，同样是很大的鼓励。
    以杜鲁门、马歇尔之流为代表的美国反动派，一方面知道战争恫吓并不能解救美帝国主义的危机，而另一方面在结束战争恫吓的赌博以前，又打算在虚张声势中施展外交诡计，幻想将苏联陷于被动，或在某种秘密谈判中愚弄苏联，以便在其侵略外交和反动内政方面取得某种便宜。但是，这种诡计在苏联诚实坚定的和平政策面前碰了壁，莫洛托夫的照会和斯大林的声明，一次又一次地打中了反动派的要害，使他们坠入了他们自己所布置的陷阱。
    与斯大林华莱士交换函件所激起的和平运动同时，美国国内反对蒙特反共法案的民主运动亦日趋高涨。十三日，在华盛顿曾召开了代表劳联、产联及铁路工人工会二百五十万会员的代表大会，号召否决该项反动法案。反蒙特法案的群众运动的各阶层、各社团的代表们，正纷纷自全国各地“向华盛顿进军”（塔斯社）。美众院已通过该项反动法案，这无疑将教育更多的美国人民认识美国财阀的法西斯面目，而加强进步力量的团结。
    本周消息中值得注意的另一事件，是巴勒斯坦地区以色列国的成立。根据一九四七年十一月二十九日联合国大会阿犹分治的决议，定名为“以色列”的新犹太国家，于十四日宣告成立。两千年来没有祖国而到处流浪受排斥侮辱与屠杀的犹太人民，他们要求建立犹太国的愿望开始实现了。以色列国成立后，已先后获得美国、苏联及波、捷、南等国的承认，英国则表示不予承认。苏联在其承认照会中表示：“希望犹太人民所创建的独立国家，将有益于巴勒斯坦及近东之巩固和平与安全事业。”苏联对于巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人和犹太人的纷争的立场，是始终一贯的，它认为在今天的局势下，只有实行阿犹分治，才是阿犹两个民族和整个近东和平的出路。与此相反，美国政府的立场，却是反复无常的。美国政府在一九四七年十一月联合国大会中是表示支持分治的，到今年三月忽然推翻前议，主张托管。而在这次犹太人宣布成立以色列国以后，美国又首先予以承认。据捷克真理报的分析：杜鲁门的行动“一部分是想防止总统选举中损失美籍犹太人的选票，一部分是因想影响犹太新国家的政府。”美国对犹太立国问题上之反复无常，充分说明它与英帝国主义一样，手段可以时常不同，但他们的目的只在如何控制中东石油资源与军事基地，与苏联之真诚扶助弱小民族政策，毫无相同之点。
