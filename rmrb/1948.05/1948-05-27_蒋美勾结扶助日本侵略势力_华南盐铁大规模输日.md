Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd – According to news from various areas in the Chiang-controlled areas: The Kuomintang bandit gang government is actively transporting Chinese raw materials to supply Japan. Recently, over 10,000 tons of pig iron from Hainan Island were shipped to Yawata, the steel center of Japan, by Chiang bandit ships. The Chiang bandits are carrying out a shameless plan to export 250,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island to Japan this year. The Chiang bandit Central News Agency shamelessly admitted: "Hainan Island iron ore has practically become the only source of raw materials needed by the Japanese steel industry." In addition, Taiwan Sugar and Taiwan Salt are also being transported to Japan in large quantities; in the middle of last month alone, 20,000 tons of Taiwan salt were shipped to Japan. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 16th: The Chiang bandit China Trust Bureau has also formulated a plan to export raw materials worth 3 million US dollars to Japan. This batch of goods includes salt, fur, tung oil, minerals, etc., and is scheduled to be shipped to Japan within four days from the 17th to the 20th of this month. According to official Chiang bandit figures, from the end of the war against Japan to the beginning of April this year, the total amount of "barter trade" conducted solely by the Chiang bandit China Trust Bureau with Japan has reached 40 million US dollars. The value of Japanese goods dumped in China by the China Trust Bureau is 25 million US dollars, while the value of raw materials exported to Japan by the Chiang bandits is 15 million US dollars. The Chiang bandits have now decided to use Chinese raw materials to repay the total excess of 10 million US dollars of Japanese goods in the Chiang-Japan "barter" this year. The purpose of the above-mentioned export of 3 million US dollars of raw materials to Japan is part of this repayment total.

　　蒋美勾结扶助日本侵略势力
  　华南盐铁大规模输日
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据蒋区各方消息：国民党匪帮政府积极输送中国原料供应日本。最近海南岛生铁一万余顿，又由蒋匪船只送往日本钢铁中心八幡。蒋匪正进行今年以二十五万吨海南岛铁矿输日的无耻计划，蒋匪中央社曾不知羞耻地自供：“海南岛铁矿实际上已成为日本钢铁工业所需原料的唯一来源”。此外，台糖与台盐亦在大量运日，仅上月中旬运往日本之台盐即达二万吨。据中央社东京十六日消息透露：蒋匪中信局又制定一以价值三百万美元的原料输日计划，此批物品包括盐、毛皮、桐油、矿石等，并定于本月十七日至二十日四天中输往日本。据蒋匪官方数字，自对日战争结束迄今年四月初，由蒋匪中信局单独与日本进行之“以货易货”贸易，总额已达四千万美元。经中信局来华倾销之日物价额为二千五百万美元，蒋匪输日原料价额则为一千五百万美元。蒋匪现已决定于今年度内以中国原料偿还蒋日“易货”中一千万美元的日货内超总额。上项三百万美元原料输日的目的，即系此偿还总额之一部分。
