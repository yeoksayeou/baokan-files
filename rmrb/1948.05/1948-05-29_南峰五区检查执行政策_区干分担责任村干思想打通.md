[Jilu豫 News] Nanfeng Fifth District, according to the county party committee's instruction to awaken village cadres to actively lead production, implement anti-leftist, correct deviations, and rectify policies, combined with the specific situation of the district, convened a district-wide village cadre conference on the 16th of this month. A total of 264 male and female village cadres attended, lasting three and a half days. The conference first addressed the issue of work attitude. The leadership used the significance and direction of party rectification and the spirit of anti-"leftist" deviation correction, combined with the past deviations of the Fifth District in implementing policies, to provide enlightenment, and called on everyone to speak their minds. Wu Yuai said: "The first time, I felt that the district cadres were indifferent and didn't understand us. When I heard about rectifying village cadres, I wanted to ride off on my bicycle. After the last village cadre meeting, I explored the situation. Work has to be done as it should be. Party rectification is like draining pus from a sore or taking medicine for an illness. Getting rid of the problems will benefit us. This has cleared my mind more." A village cadre from Xiwangzhong said: "After returning, we can't eat and drink recklessly anymore. We must fairly share labor duties and take the lead. As long as we want the masses, the masses will want us. We can't just guess what people are thinking." After a day of discussion, most village cadres' morale was further enhanced, and those who were doubtful were also clarified. Some village cadres, although they believed that the spirit of party rectification was to cure diseases and save people, felt that their mistakes were serious or couldn't understand specific policy implementation. Cheng Daoji, chairman of the Cheng Village Farmers' Association, said: "When the superiors told us to classify classes at the beginning of the year, those with a calf were landlords. Now it's wrong again. Anyway, nothing is certain. Being a village cadre is like a lump of clay, to be molded however they want. They say they won't rectify village cadres, but isn't this rectifying village cadres?" The leadership decided to not only educate these comrades after the meeting but also help them solve specific problems. The second issue was to examine the mistakes in policy implementation, with district and village cadres sharing responsibility. The leadership first affirmed the achievements since the land reform, stating that most poor and hired peasants had been allocated an average of one and a half mu of good land to five mu of poorer land per person, and their lives had improved. It was also explained that in the process of land reform, especially district cadres had a vague class viewpoint and unstable policy grasp, leading to many deviations. For example: (1) The scope of struggle was wide, and classes were wrongly classified. Under the pretext of erroneous slogans such as "It's okay as long as we get it going," the middle peasants were severely harmed. For example, in Wang Village, out of 36 households, 28 were struggled against, including six who were evicted. Others were fined money and grain. Initially, the village couldn't start the struggle, so they mobilized the village chiefs, heads of farmers' associations, and activists from 46 administrative villages to "attack the stubborn strongholds," etc. These mistakes were due to our past vague class concepts and unclear policy boundaries. We can't just blame the village cadres. Many villages were led by district cadres in person. District cadres should take responsibility. After the village cadres were convinced, they were encouraged to discuss what harm it caused us to wrongly struggle against the middle peasants. Later, they slowly understood that everyone had worked hard to live. If they were struggled against, others would lose the heart to live. If we were wrong, we should return things to them. There were also disputes when discussing the resettlement of landlords and rich peasants. Some said that since they were struggled against, why resettle them? Anyway, they are not on our side. Even if you give them honey to eat, they will still bite your finger. Some said that we can't kill every landlord, we have to let them live. But what good is it if they steal a little every day? Landlords are like unbaked adobe bricks. Now we need to tame their nature and let them participate in labor. Most people's thinking changed. Only a few people's thinking did not change. When discussing industry and commerce, some said, "Why should poor peasants compensate for the things they were given from industry and commerce?" Some said that it was exploitation and should be struggled against. Later, it was mentioned that the masses encountered many difficulties when industry and commerce were struggled against. For example, if the cart shop was struggled against, there would be no place to repair carts. If the oil mill was struggled against, there would be fewer places to sell oil, and the price of oil would be more expensive. If we want to till the land, there is no one to make hoes. If we want to weave cloth, there is no one to make looms. They understood it from the perspective of their own lives. As for how, everyone should find a way, and it can't be that whoever received something is responsible for compensating for it themselves.
 After clarifying the boundaries of the policy, the discussion immediately turned to what to do after returning. Everyone believed that the policy must be rectified and production improved. Regarding the disbanding of compulsory mutual aid teams, some people did not understand, such as saying: "The superiors said to disband the mutual aid teams. What will happen when labor and war service are needed in the future? Fine, in the future, we will push anything to you in the district!" Later, the village cadres of Caofosi used facts to illustrate the problem of compulsory mutual aid delaying production. Afterwards, most people believed that it should be abolished and voluntary organizations should be mobilized.

　　南峰五区检查执行政策
  　区干分担责任村干思想打通
    【冀鲁豫消息】南峰五区根据县委唤醒村干积极起来领导生产，贯彻反左、纠偏、端正政策的指示，结合着本区具体情况，于本月十六日召开了全区村干大会，到会男女村干共二百六十四人，开了三天半。会上首先解决工作态度问题，由领导上把整党的意义方针和反“左”纠偏的精神结合五区过去在执行政策中的偏向作了一个启发，又号召大家说心思。吴玉爱说：“头一回子觉得区干对咱冷淡不摸底，听说要整村干就想骑上洋车跑了。上次开了村干部会后摸了摸底，工作该怎做还得怎做，整党好比长疮的流脓，害病的吃药，把毛病去掉了对咱还有好处。这样我思想更通了。”西旺冢村干说：回去后可不能胡乱吃喝了，派差也要公平起带头作用，只要咱要群众，群众也就会要咱的，可不要胡猜心思了。经过一天讨论，大部村干情绪更提高了一步，怀疑的也清亮了。有个别村干虽然对整党是治病救人的精神相信了，但联系到自己的错误，感到严重，或者联系到具体执行政策时就不通了。程庄农会长程道基说：“年时上级叫划阶级时，有小牛的就是地主，现在又错了，反正没一定的事，当村干的好比一块胶泥，愿意怎就怎，只说不整村干，这还不是整村干呀。”领导上就决定对这些同志除了在会后进行教育外，并在具体问题上帮助他们解决。第二个问题就是检查执行政策上的错误，区村干部分清责任。领导上首先肯定土改以来的成绩，绝大部分贫雇平均起来每人已分到一亩半好地到五亩较孬的土地，生活都得到改善。又说明在土改过程中，特别是区干部阶级观点模糊，政策掌握不稳，出了不少的偏向。如：（一）斗争面宽，错划了阶级，在“只要轰起来就中”等错误借口下，严重的伤害了中农。例如王庄共三十六户人家，斗了廿八户，其中扫地出门的六家。其他是罚款罚粮等。开始村里斗不起来，发动四十六个行政村的村长农会长积极分子去“打顽固攻碉堡”等等。这些错误都是由于过去我们阶级观念模糊，政策界限不清，不能只责怪村干部，好多村都是区干亲自领着干的，区干应负责任。这样村干服气后，即启发大家讨论错斗了中农对咱有哪些害处，后来慢慢的想通了，认为都是辛辛苦苦过的日子，要是斗了他，别的人就没心过日子了。错了就该退还给人家。在讨论安置地富问题时，也有争论，有的说要斗就斗了，还安置个啥，反正他跟咱们不是一个心眼。你就是给他蜜吃，他还得咬你的手指头。有的说地主反正不能每个都打死吧，总得叫他活着。他每天偷一把摸一把，对咱有啥好处？地主好比生土坯子，现在是要咱们打熟他的性，让他参加劳动。大多数思想转过来了。只有几个人思想没转过来。在讨论工商业时，有的说贫农分了工商业的东西怎么叫他赔呢？有的说那算剥削应该斗。后来谈到斗了工商业群众受到很多困难。例如把小车子铺斗了，就没地方收拾车子，把油坊斗了，卖油的少了，油价就贵。咱想去锄地没有做锄的啦，想织布没人做织布机啦，从切身生活问题上想通了。至于如何，应该大家设法，不能谁分了只由他自己赔。
    在政策上划清界限以后，紧接着讨论回去以后怎么办，大家认为一定要端正政策，把生产搞好。在生产问题上，对于解散强迫命令的互助组，有的思想不通，如说：上级说解散互助组，看今后出差战勤下来了怎办，好吧，以后有啥事推给你区里吧！后由草佛寺的村干部用事实说明了强迫互助耽误生产的问题，以后多数人，认为应该取消，发动自愿组织。
