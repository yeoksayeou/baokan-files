Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 17th: Washington Dispatch: "Over 2.25 million workers have been involved in strikes or wage increase disputes in the railroad, automobile, telephone, meatpacking, aircraft, shipbuilding, rubber, and petroleum industries," as revealed in a report by the U.S. Department of Labor on the 7th. Since then, the number of people involved in wage increase struggles and participating in strikes has continued to increase. Seventy-five thousand workers at sixteen Chrysler automobile factories began a major strike on the 12th due to the management's refusal to increase wages, and dispatched worker pickets to guard the entrances of various factories. The workers stated that they would not stop until their goals were achieved. The strike by Boeing Aircraft Company workers in Seattle, which has lasted for more than three weeks, is still ongoing and expanding, with the number of strikers increasing from 14,000 to 50,000. Twenty-three thousand telephone operators and three thousand five hundred biscuit workers have also decided to hold strikes soon. The United Mine Workers of America, which has 400,000 members, recently called on workers to take advantage of the law that "allows workers not to work without a contract" when their old contracts expire before June 30th, to hold a major strike demanding wage increases.

Another dispatch: The major strike of over 100,000 railroad workers, originally scheduled to begin on the 11th, has been temporarily canceled due to Truman's and the federal court's issuance of reactionary orders to take over the railroads and prohibit strikes.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 17th: New York Dispatch: According to the New York Times, the president of the National Machine Tool Builders' Association, Mr. Burney, said: "The machine manufacturing industry is facing extreme difficulties because the U.S. government has stopped shipping machines to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, and has failed to supply any other markets." Burney also stated: "The machine manufacturing industry cannot accept orders from any other foreign countries because it is unknown whether those countries can pay." He warned: "We should not handle foreign trade like playing ball."

　　美二百廿五万工人
    进行罢工增资斗争
  　全美机器制造业面对危机
    【新华社陕北十七日电】华盛顿讯：“二百二十五万以上工人已卷入铁路、汽车、电话、肉类包装、飞机、造船、橡胶、石油等工业的罢工或增资纠纷中，”这是美劳工部于七日报告中所透露的。在此以后。卷入增资斗争与参加罢工的人数继续增加。克莱斯勒汽车公司十六个工厂的七万五千工人，因资方拒绝增资而于十二日开始大罢工，并于各工厂入口处派遣工人纠察队守卫。工人们表示不达目的不止。坚持三周余的西雅图波音飞机公司工人的罢工，仍在坚持与扩大中，罢工人数已由一万四千增至五万人。两万三千电话接线生及三千五百饼干工人，亦决于最近举行罢工。拥有四十万会员的矿工联合会，日前又号召工人于六月三十日前旧合同满期时，利用“允许在没有合同即不工作”的法令，举行要求增资的大罢工。
    又讯：原定于十一日开始的十余万铁道工人大罢工，已因杜鲁门、联邦法庭颁发接收铁路与禁止罢工的反动令而暂告取消。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】纽约讯，据纽约时报载称：美全国机器制造业主协会会长伯尔尼说：“机器制造业面临极大的困难，因为美政府停止将机器运往苏联及其他东欧国家，而又未能供应其他任何市场。”伯尔尼又称：“机器制造业不能接受其他任何外国的定货，因为不知道那些国家能否付出钱来。”他警告说：“我们处理对外贸易不应象打球一样。”
