Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: The industry and commerce of Andong City are developing rapidly. The Municipal Government convened a representative conference of industry and commerce in early March, explicitly announcing the democratic government's policy of protecting industry and commerce. It also returned or compensated all the materials that were wrongly confiscated during the urban work last winter from eleven businesses, including Chenguang Handicraft Cooperative, Qianshengtai Printing Factory, Wenguang Printing Bureau, Liaodong Restaurant, and Dongshengzhan. Dongshengzhan was also given all the profits of more than 4 million yuan made during the government takeover. In general, industrialists and businessmen dispelled their worries and resumed or developed their businesses one after another. The Northeast Bank also provided low-interest loans of 280 million yuan to various private industrial and commercial enterprises starting in early March. Among them, more than 20 cotton textile businesses, after receiving loans, increased and restored a total of more than 70 power looms. According to incomplete statistics at the end of March, the number of industrial and commercial enterprises in the city (excluding hawkers) increased from 3,729 to 4,255, an increase of 526. Among them, industry increased by 153, and commerce increased by 337. This is an increase of 980 compared with the 3,275 during the puppet Manchurian period, and an increase of 1,185 compared with the period when Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied the area last spring. It is also an increase of 496 compared with the period before Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied the area. Due to the correct implementation of policies, urban industry and commerce have prospered, and the relationship between urban and rural areas has become closer. The city is now transporting a large number of daily necessities for farmers to the countryside, and the countryside is continuously importing raw materials such as grain, cotton, and tussah cocoons into the city. Recently, more than 100 large carts travel between urban and rural areas every day, and the transportation industry has also been further developed. The city's private automobile company increased its number of cars by four in March, and the An-Shen Railway Bureau's passenger and freight revenue in March exceeded more than three times that of January and February.

　　安东纠偏后
    商业大发展
    【新华社东北十五日电】安东市工商业日益发展，市政府三月初曾召开工商业代表大会，明确宣布民主政府保护工商业政策，并退还或补偿了去冬城市工作中发生偏差而错没收了的晨光工艺社、乾盛泰印刷厂、文光印刷局、辽东饭店、东盛栈等十一家全部物资。东盛栈在政府接管期间所得盈利四百余万元也全部交给原主。一般工商业者即打消顾虑，纷纷恢复或发展营业。东北银行亦自三月上旬起即以低利贷款两亿八千万元分别贷予各私营工商业。其中有二十余家棉织业在获得贷款后，共增加与恢复了电力棉织机七十余架。据三月底不完全统计全市工商业（行商不在内）即自三千七百二十九家增至四千二百五十五家，增加了五百二十六家。其中工业增加了一百五十三家，商业增加三百三十七家，较伪满时期的三千二百七十五家增加九百八十家，较去春蒋匪侵占时期则增加一千一百八十五家。较蒋匪侵占前亦增加四百九十六家。由于正确执行政策，城市工商业繁荣，现在城乡关系已更加密切，该市现已将大批农民生活必需品运销乡村，乡村亦将粮食、棉花、柞茧等原料源源输入市内。近来城乡大车往还每日均在百余辆以上，交通运输事业也因此进一步得到发展；该市私营汽车公司三月份即增加汽车四辆，安沈铁路局三月份客货运费收入则较一、二月份超过三倍以上。
