Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. London, 12th: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party recently passed a resolution protesting the authorities' ban on political marches in London. The resolution stated: This ban strikes at one of the labor movement's most precious rights. The resolution criticized the fact that Mosley's fascists would be allowed to continue holding political rallies and be protected by the police. The resolution demanded a ban on all fascist rallies and activities, the immediate restoration of the right of workers to march in the streets of London, and called on the entire working class and all progressive forces in Britain to insist on these demands to the Labor government.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. London: Various British trade unions have recently held annual meetings to oppose the Labor government's domestic and foreign policies. The South Wales Miners' Federation (representing 100,000 workers) resolved at its annual meeting on the 7th to condemn the Labor government's "spending of 900 million pounds annually on armed forces as unreasonable" and denounced Britain's subservience to American power in the Mediterranean as endangering peace. The resolution also protested fascist activities in Britain and demanded that the Labor government stop Mosley's fascists' "increasingly rampant tyranny." The Electrical Trades Union, representing 170,000 members, opened on the 10th. The union's chairman, Foulkes, strongly criticized the Labor leaders' divisive actions and reactionary wage policies, and he demanded "the greatest unity in the trade unions." The congress unanimously demanded the immediate nationalization of the steel industry and protested the reduction of capital use, pointing out that this would reduce construction plans, hinder industry, and make Britain a slave of American big business. The Postal Workers Union, representing 150,000 members, also held its annual meeting on the 11th and rejected the union's general secretary, Gaitskell's, request for the congress to approve the policies of the British Trades Union Congress and the government. "When Gaitskell nonsensically claimed that the Labor government had limited profits and reduced the burden on the working class in the interim budget, the entire hall erupted in angry shouts of 'No!''No!'"

　　英共执委会通过决议
  　抗议当局反动禁令
    【新华社陕北二十日电】伦敦十二日讯：英共执委会顷通过决议，抗议当局禁止在伦敦举行政治游行。决议说：这一禁令打击了劳工运动最宝贵的权利之一。决议抨击摩斯莱法西斯分子将被允许继续举行政治集会，并受警察保护。决议要求禁止一切法西斯集会和活动，立即恢复工人在伦敦街上游行的权利，并号召整个工人阶级和英国所有进步势力，坚持这些对工党政府的要求。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】伦敦讯：英国各职工会近纷纷举行年会，反对工党政府的内外政策。南威尔士矿工同盟（代表十万工人）年会于七日决议，谴责工党政府“每年在武装部队上开支九亿英镑是无理的”，并痛斥英国在地中海顺从美国势力危及和平。决议并抗议英境的法西斯活动，要求工党政府阻止摩斯莱法西斯分子“愈益增长的横行霸道。”代表十七万会员的电气职工联合会于十日揭幕，该会主席佛尔克斯强烈抨击工党领袖的分裂行动及反动的工资政策，他要求“在工会中争取最大的团结。”大会一致要求钢铁工业立即国有化，并抗议减少资本用途，指出此举将减少建筑计划，阻碍工业，并使英国成为美国大企业之奴仆。代表十五万会员的邮政联合会亦于十一日举行年会，否决了该工会总书记盖得斯特要求大会批准英职工大会和政府的政策。“当盖得斯特胡说工党政府在临时预算中已限制利润并减轻工人阶级负担时，全场激起一片‘否’‘否’的怒吼。”
