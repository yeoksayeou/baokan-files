　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 19th: Belated news: The local armed forces of the Third Sub-district of Yu, Anhui, and Jiangsu Provinces, while suppressing the pseudo-Xiao County Security Regiment under Li Gongda in western Xiao County, completely annihilated the enemy on April 26th, capturing three strongholds including Mengyoufang, Zhao Village, and Wu Lou. Over a hundred bandits were killed or wounded, and over four hundred were captured, including the pseudo-deputy regiment commander and below. They seized one mortar, one 60mm gun, over twenty light and heavy machine guns, hundreds of rifles and short guns, and one radio station.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th: On the 14th, the People's Liberation Army, in the Xiaolong area, 40 li northwest of Changchun, repelled a regiment of the Kuomintang bandit army's Provisional 61st Division which had come out of Changchun to harass, annihilating two complete companies (one of which was a heavy machine gun company), capturing over sixty enemy soldiers and killing over ninety. They seized six 60mm guns, six light and heavy machine guns, and dozens of rifles. Furthermore, a unit of cavalry from the Changchun Kuomintang bandit army (originally belonging to the bandit Jilin Military Region's "Volunteer" Corps), consisting of thirty-seven men, defected to our side on the 13th, bringing with them forty-eight horses, one light machine gun, and thirty-five rifles.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 19th: The bandit Yan Xishan laments that he is facing an increasingly desperate situation, fearing annihilation by the People's Liberation Army. Yan bandit once told his cadres, "Not running is two roads to death." He said: "We suffered this loss in Zhongyang, Xi County, Hongdong, Zhao City, Huo County, Shuo County, Ningwu, Guo County, Dai County, Pingding, and Shouyang in the past (referring to not running). This loss was suffered by our small forces, and now the large forces outside the pass have also suffered this loss. This proves that we (referring to the Jiang-Yan bandits) have airplanes and artillery, but instead, they have created two roads to death, either scattered to be killed by the enemy (referring to the People's Liberation Army), or gathered back to starve to death." He said: "He (referring to the People's Liberation Army) is deploying a large number of troops to attack our teams, not hesitating to attack them three or five times. The result is that he captures our officers and soldiers, seizes our guns, and turns our troops into his (referring to the People's Liberation Army's) conscription brigade and gun transport team." He demanded that his cadres "must learn to run," resorting to a bandit-like rampage to rob and steal to survive when necessary. Yan bandit said pessimistically and disappointedly: "Hunger forces us to beg for food in the countryside."

　　萧县保安团全部被歼
  　长春西北我歼匪两连
    【新华社中原十九日电】迟到消息：豫皖苏三分区地方武装清剿萧县西部伪萧县保安团李公达部，于四月二十六日全部歼灭该敌，攻克孟油坊、赵庄、武楼等三据点，计毙伤匪百余名，生俘伪副团长以下四百余名。缴迫击炮、六○炮各一门，轻重机枪二十余挺，长短枪数百支，电台一部。
    【新华社东北十九日电】解放军十四日在长春西北四十里之小合隆一带，击退由长春出扰国民党匪军暂六十一师一个团，歼其两个整连（内一为重机枪连），俘敌六十余名，毙敌九十余名。缴六○炮六门，轻重机枪六挺，步枪数十支。又长春国民党匪军骑兵一部（原属匪吉林师管区“志愿”兵团）三十七人于十三日向我投诚，携来马四十八匹，轻机枪一挺，步枪三十五支。
    【新华社晋绥十九日电】匪阎锡山哀鸣其日益面临绝境，畏惧被解放军歼灭。阎匪曾对他的干部说“不会跑是死路两条。”他说：“我们过去在中阳、隰县、洪洞、赵城、霍县、朔县、宁武、崞县、代县、平定、寿阳吃了这个亏（指不会跑），这个亏是我们小兵力吃了的，现在关外的大兵力也吃了这个亏，这证明我们（指蒋阎匪）有飞机大炮，反而造成了两条死路，分散开叫敌人（指解放军）打死，集结回来自己饿死。”他说：“他（指解放军）是调上多数兵力打我们队伍，不惜三番五次的打，结果是俘虏我们的官兵，缴我们的枪支，把我们的部队，作成他（指解放军）的兵役大队和枪械的输送队。”他要求其干部“必须学会跑”。不得已时来一个流寇式的乱窜，掠劫偷生。阎匪悲观失望的说：“饥饿迫得我们向乡村乞食。”
