[Heshun News] The First District summarized its spring plowing and production work for the past month and a half on May 17th. The masses' emotions have shifted from turmoil to stability, and village cadres have gradually turned from passive to active. In the beginning, there were many obstacles. Village cadres lay down and refused to lead, waiting to be struggled against; the masses waited for equal distribution and dared not cultivate the land; middle peasants were even more afraid. The main reason for the village cadres' lying down was that the leadership had adopted a uniformly exclusionary, distrustful, and indifferent attitude, and had put all leadership resources into experimental villages, treating production as an afterthought. Later, the county party committee emphasized strengthening production leadership, corrected the attitude of uniformly excluding village cadres, and specifically publicized the Outline Land Law and "whoever sows, reaps," and the production mood gradually turned around. Cadres expressed that they would lead production well in the future. Dai Laisuo, the party secretary of Dafa Head Village, said: "I now realize that only by leading production well can I reduce my mistakes."

The compensation of middle peasants and the resettlement of landlords and rich peasants encountered resistance from village cadres. The party secretary of Xiyao Village said: "My thinking was not clear at first. Seeing that other villages had not yet resettled, I did not do it." Cadre resistance meant that the masses were also unconvinced. During a discussion in Bei'an Village, Niu Sanzhong said: "In the past, when we struggled against them, we said not to, but the higher-ups insisted on struggling." Some said: "They only struggled for a year and now they're telling us to return the land. I don't know what kind of policy this is," and so on. Therefore, we repeatedly explained that resettling landlords was not to pity them, nor was it to say that the struggles in the past were wrong, but simply to allow them to labor and produce. The leadership exposed the landlords' rumors. Then, in accordance with the county party committee's instructions, the control of landlords and rich peasants was stopped, they were allowed to produce freely, and participate in mutual aid teams. Each person was given land producing two shi of grain (in villages that had not yet implemented land redistribution), they were not allowed to perform obligatory labor, and their wages were not allowed to be lower than those of peasants, ensuring that no one would starve to death. Old fruit land (undistributed) borrowed by households living in ravines was returned and re-lent to poor and landless peasants to compensate middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against, and to resettle landlords and rich peasants. For land that had already been sown, land of equal grain yield that had not yet been sown was exchanged. Manure and labor already applied were returned. Households with more land could rent or sharecrop; those who sincerely wished to lend land could do so with the approval of the district. Those fundamentally lacking land were lent grain and tools to open up wasteland, with no burden for five years. If life could not be immediately resolved, free mutual lending was allowed, and this should not be considered pitying landlords or sheltering landlords. If mutual lending could not solve the problem, the village's fruit grain and righteous granary grain could be lent. Those who had found other occupations (such as artisans) and could maintain their livelihoods could be lent less or not lent at all, but they could not refuse resettlement on the pretext of having other occupations. Middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against were compensated more, and it was explained that they would be thoroughly compensated in future land redistribution. Poor and middle peasants who had been falsely accused of being special agents were exonerated, and the components classified during the "three checks" were all invalidated. According to statistics from 32 villages, a total of 35 households (not including those who could maintain their lives) and 1,478 people were compensated and resettled, and now they have 2,486.5 mu of land (including borrowed land), producing 1,629 shi of grain, with an average of 49.1 mu per person and 3.21 shi of grain. After compensation and resettlement, both wrongly struggled middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants expressed that they must produce well in the future.

After compensation and resettlement, the district's major crops have now all been sown. According to statistics from 35 administrative villages, a total of 71,341.04 mu has been sown, of which 53,430.01 mu has been sown and 17,911.03 mu has not yet been sown. The reason for the unsown land is that the season has not yet arrived, and early sowing would not yield a harvest, such as buckwheat and naked oats. According to statistics from 32 villages, there are a total of 3,466 households, of which 3,239 households have been organized, forming a total of 359 groups. The organization emphasized voluntary combination, and the organizational form was made smaller to suit the needs of the masses, making it easy to combine and not time-consuming. However, on the other hand, there was also spontaneous outflow, with form but no substance. In serious cases, such as in Gaojiazhuang, five of the nine mutual aid teams were not functioning.

Some villages have done a good job in sideline production and disaster relief. For example, Guanzhuang Village earned 61,000 yuan by weaving baskets, which was a great help; Taiyangpo earned 170,000 yuan in foreign currency by burning charcoal; Sanquan Village scraped 26,000 jin of elm bark, earning 738,000 yuan in foreign currency, which completely solved the difficulties of the spring famine. However, some villages are not actively engaged in sideline production and mutual lending, but are waiting for relief from the higher authorities.

### 补偿中农安置地主和顺一区大部下种

　　补偿中农安置地主和顺一区大部下种
    【和顺消息】一区于五月十七日总结一月半来的春耕生产工作。群众情绪已由动荡转到安定，村干部已由消沉逐渐转向积极。开始时，曾有许多障碍。村干部躺倒不领导，等着挨斗；群众等待平分，不敢种地；中农更是害怕。村干部躺倒的主要原因，是领导上曾采取一律排挤、不相信、不理态度，且把领导力量全部放在实验村，把生产当成捎办。以后县委强调加强生产领导，纠正对村干部一律排挤的态度，具体宣传土地法大纲和谁种谁收，生产情绪逐渐扭过来。干部表示今后要好好领导生产。大发头支书戴来锁说：“我现在认识只有好好领导生产，才能减轻自己的错误”。
    补偿中农、安置地富中，曾遇到村干部的抵抗。细窑支书说：“我原来思想就不通，见别的村也还没有安置，我也就没作。”干部抵抗，群众也不通。北安＠群众讨论时，牛三中说：“以前斗时，咱说不要斗，上级非叫斗”。有的说：“斗争刚一年就叫退，这不知道是啥政策”等等。因此我们反复说明安置地主并不是可怜地主，也不是过去斗的不对，只是为了让他们劳动生产。对地主造谣领导上加以揭发。接着就依照县委指示，停止对地富的管制，允许自由生产，参加互助组，每人给以二石产粮的土地（未抽补村），不准有义务劳动，不准工资低于农民，保证不饿死一个人。旧存果实地（未分配的）借到圪堆户上的，一律退出来，重新借给少地无地的贫雇，补偿错斗中农，安置地富。已下种的，用自己未下种的地（同等产粮）换种。已上粪上工的还粪还工。地多的户可以租种伙种，真心愿借出者，经区批准可以借种。根本少地的借给粮食工具去开荒，五年不负担。生活马上无法解决的，允许自由互借，不能认为是可怜地主，包庇地主。互借不能解决的，村里的果实粮、义仓粮可以借给。已经找下其他职业（如手艺工人），能维持生活的，可以不借或少借。但不能借口有其他职业而拒绝安置。错斗中农补偿的多些，并说明在将来抽补时还要彻底补偿。贫雇中农过去反成特务无确实根据的一律摘帽，三查划的成份，一律作废。据卅二个村统计，共补偿安置了三五户（能维持生活的未统计在内），一四七八口人，现在土地（借的也在内）二四八六·五亩，产粮一六二九石，每人平均地四九·一亩，产粮三·二一石。经过补偿安置，不论错斗中农和地富，都表示今后一定要好好生产。
    经过补偿与安置，全区的大庄稼现已全部种完。据三十五个行政村统计，共七一三四一·○四亩，已下种的有五三四三○·○一亩，未下种的一七九一一·○三亩，未下种的原因，是节令不到，早种不收，如荞麦、莜麦等。卅二个村统计，共三四六六户，组织起来的三二三九户，共组织了三五九个组。组织中强调了自愿结合，组织形式变小，适合群众要求，好结合，不费时间。但另一方面，又发生了自流，有形式无实际。严重的如郜家庄，九个互助组就有五个不起作用。
    副业生产与救济春荒有些村作的好。如官庄村，编筐赚了六万一千元，顶了大事；太阳坡烧石炭赚洋十七万元，三泉村刮胡菜树皮二万六千斤，赚洋七十三万八千元，整个解决了春荒困难。但有些村不是积极起来搞副业、互借，而是等着上级救济。
