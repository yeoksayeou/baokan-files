　　Comrade Liu Yanzeng of Xicun Village, Yuanshi: Here are brief answers to your questions: Regarding the issue of indiscriminate labeling of people as "special agents," the Central Bureau has already issued instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee stating that the label of "special agent" must be unconditionally removed, and their civil rights restored. If property has been confiscated, it should be returned immediately. If it has already been distributed as a result of struggle sessions, necessary living and production materials should be provided to them now so they can engage in production, with compensation to be made in the future. It is incorrect to treat the things that pseudo-village chiefs collected for the enemy as their embezzlement during struggle sessions. Political attacks and economic elimination must be clearly distinguished. If they have difficulties with production, solutions should also be provided. As for the issue of landlords and rich peasants controlling village political power, your question is extremely vague and cannot be answered.
　　Comrade Li Benyuan of Dongguan, Nanhe: If the woman you have met has completed the divorce procedures with her original husband, you can get married with the approval of the district office, provided you both agree. The woman's clan members or members of the Poor People's Committee should not interfere without reason.
　　Comrade Li Wenyi of Zhangdong Village, Xingtai: Your letter reflecting the issue of the Peace Hospital buying medicine from the fruits of struggle in Xingtai and not paying according to the decision has been forwarded to the Peace Hospital for handling.
　　Comrades Chen Shiying et al. of the Eighth District of Xingtai: Brief answers to your questions are as follows: 1. If the masses are willing to dredge river滩land to create fertile land, that is very good. It can be handled by the County and District Peasant Representatives' Meeting (or its committee) according to item "C" of the supplementary provisions in item 8 of the Land Law Outline, which supplements item "B" of article 9 of the Outline. 2. In general, if famine refugees have already settled down elsewhere, it is best to encourage them to settle there. However, if they insist on returning to their place of origin, do not force them to stay. But they can only be allocated one share in one place and cannot be allocated in two places. 3. If Zhao Yongde of Yulin Village stipulated that the boy would only be taken for six years when he divorced his wife, then he can be taken back according to the agreement when the six years are up.
　　Reading Group of Caojiazhuang, Tenth District of Wu'an: 1. Regarding the railway occupying your village's land, you can ask the relevant parties to resolve it in accordance with the measures issued by the Border Government regarding the use of land for railways and highways. 2. The responsible agency has notified the power plant to send someone to level the land damaged by the power plant's excavation. 3. The matter of the coal mine occupying land is currently being discussed with the coal mine to find a solution. As for the blockade trenches dug by the enemy, mobilize the masses to fill them in for cultivation. If there is insufficient manpower, you can consult with the county and district leading agencies to find a solution.

    元氏西×村刘炎增同志：你所提的问题，简答如下：关于乱戴特务帽子问题，中央局给太岳区党委指示中已提出，特务帽子要一律无条件的摘掉，并恢复其公民权。财产若被查封应立即退还，若已斗争分散，则现在应该先给以必要的生活和生产资料，使他们有条件进行生产，到将来填补时再为补偿。斗争伪保长，把他们给敌人收的东西算作他们的贪污是不对的，政治上的打击与经济上的消灭必须分清，他们若生产有困难，也应同样给以解决。至于村里地主富农掌握村政权问题，你提的极不具体，无法作答。
    南和东关李本元同志：你所结识的那个妇女，已和她原来丈夫办清离婚手续，在你二人同意下可经过区公所批准结婚，这个妇女的族人或贫民委员都不应无故干涉。
    邢台张东村李文义同志：来信反映和平医院买了邢台斗争果实药品未按决定付款问题，已寄给和平医院处理。
    邢台八区陈世英等同志：你们的几个问题简答如下：一、河滩地若群众愿意打淤地是很好的，可按土地法大纲补充办法中第八项对于大纲第九条“乙”项之补充中之“丙”项规定，由县区农民代表会（或其委员会）处理之。二、一般逃荒户若已在外安家，最好就动员他们在那里安家，但本人若一定要回原籍的也不勉强。但只能确定在一个地方分一份，不得两头重分。三、鱼鳞村赵永德和他妻子离婚时若说定男孩只带六年的话，则到六年时可以依约领回。
    武安十区曹家庄读报组：一、铁路占用你村土地，可请有关方面按边府颁发的关于铁路公路使用土地办法解决。二、电厂挖坏的土地，负责机关已通知该厂派人负责平好。三、煤矿占用土地，现正与煤矿商讨解决办法。至于敌人在时挖的封锁沟，动员群众填平，以便耕种，力量不足可商请县区领导机关想法解决。
