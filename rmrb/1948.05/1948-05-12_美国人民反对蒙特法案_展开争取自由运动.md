Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: New York dispatch: A movement opposing the anti-communist and anti-democratic Mundt Bill (i.e., the "Subversive Activities Control Act," proposed by Republican Congressman Mundt) is unfolding across the United States. Leaders of the Third Party from seven states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut, and Michigan, met in Washington on the 5th, demanding the repeal of the Mundt Bill. The National Committee of the National Maritime Union (CIO) passed a resolution denouncing the Mundt Bill, stating: "This will be a measure to restrict the civil rights of all Americans and prevent trade unions from fighting to improve the working and living conditions of workers." The CIO committees of New York and Wayne County, Michigan, passed resolutions on the 5th, urging all trade union members to unite around the committee to fight against "the vicious aims of the Mundt Bill." A meeting of the CIO Electrical Workers Union, representing over 7,000 workers at the "Westinghouse" Electric Company in Philadelphia, demanded that all members of Congress from Pennsylvania unanimously vote against the bill. The Philadelphia AFL Printing Trades Union, currently on strike, also held a similar protest rally. One hundred and thirty-seven prominent writers, artists, scientists, educators, and clergy recently issued a joint statement in New York, strongly condemning the Mundt Bill and demanding the abolition of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Countless protests against the Mundt Bill are flooding Congress like snowflakes.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: New York dispatch: The American "Southern Negro Youth Congress" (an organization dedicated to destroying racial discrimination and guaranteeing equal rights for Negroes), overcoming obstruction from the authorities, held a meeting in North Birmingham on the 2nd, attended by 170 Negro and white representatives. When they gathered in a Negro church for the meeting, the police brutally interfered and arrested three white individuals—Dombrowski, head of the progressive "Southern Conference for Human Welfare" organization, Fannie, a representative of the CIO Retail Clerks Union, and the Negro church pastor, Allivor—who were scheduled to speak at the meeting. The police attempted to disrupt the meeting under the pretext that blacks and whites could not meet without segregation, but the representatives erected a line within the church to segregate blacks and whites and continued the meeting. Further news: The Third Party's vice-presidential candidate, Senator Taylor, was arrested on the 2nd while attending a meeting of the "Southern Negro Youth Congress" because he entered the venue through the black section, and was sentenced to a $50 fine and a six-month suspended sentence. Wallace strongly condemned this, stating: "Taylor encountered violent action while promoting the Third Party's policy of resisting undemocratic and racially discriminatory evils. Freedom is being suppressed within the country. This clearly exposes the hypocrisy of the government's spending billions of dollars to build up its military to defend so-called 'freedom in other countries.'"

    美国人民反对蒙特法案
    展开争取自由运动
    【新华社陕北十日电】纽约讯：反对蒙特反共反民主法案（按即“破坏行为控制法”，共和党议员蒙特为该案提案人）的运动，正在全美展开。代表纽约、宾州、马萨诸塞、马里兰、俄亥俄、康涅狄格及密执安等七州的第三党领袖，于五日在华盛顿集会，要求取消蒙特法案。产联海员工会全国委员会决议斥责蒙特法案称：“这将是限制一切美国人的民权的措施；并阻止职工会进行改善工人工作与生活条件的斗争。”纽约与密执安州魏尼县的产联委员会，五日通过决议，敦促各职工会会员团结在该委员会周围，为“反对蒙特法案的凶恶目的”而斗争。费城代表“威斯汀豪斯”电气公司七千余工人的产联电气工会会议，要求宾州所有国会议员一致投票反对这一法案。刻在罢工中的费城劳联印刷工人工会亦举行同样的抗议大会。一百三十七名著名的作家、艺术家、科学家、教育工作者与牧师，顷在纽约发表联合声明，力斥蒙特法案，并要求取消众院非美活动委员会。无数反对蒙特法案的抗议书，如雪片般飞至国会。
    【新华社陕北十日电】纽约讯：美国“南方黑人青年大会”（该会是以摧毁种族歧视与保证予黑人平等权利为要旨的组织）冲破当局的阻挠，已于二日在北明翰开会，到一百七十名黑人及白人代表。当他们聚集黑人教堂开会时，警察前来进行凶横的干涉，并逮捕了将在会上演说的进步的“南方人类福利大会”组织的负责人杜姆布劳斯基、产联店员工会代表法尼等三个白人以及黑人教堂牧师阿利佛尔。警察企图借口黑白人不分隔不得开会来破坏会议的进行，但各代表就在教堂内竖立起黑白人分隔的界线，继续会议。又讯：第三党副总统候选人、参议员泰勒在二日出席“南方黑人青年大会”会议时，但他由黑人人口处进入会场而横遭逮捕，并被判处五十美元罚金及六个月缓刑。华莱士对此加以痛斥称：“泰勒在推行第三党反抗不民主和歧视种族的罪恶政策时却遭到了暴力行动。这一自由在国内正受到箝制。这清楚地揭露了政府花十亿美元建立武装，用以保卫所谓‘他国自由’的这种行动的假面具。”
