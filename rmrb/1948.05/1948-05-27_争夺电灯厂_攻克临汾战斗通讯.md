　　Contending for the Electric Light Plant
  　Battle Communication on the Capture of Linfen
    Zhao Hengzhi
    The Linfen electric light plant was located right next to the northern city wall of Dongguan, with a distance of at most thirty meters; at the same time, it was no more than a hundred meters away from the eastern city wall of Linfen, which gave the electric light plant significant military importance. As far as the enemy was concerned, it was the most important barrier connecting the two city walls. Losing the electric light plant would not only make Dongguan difficult to defend, but also expose the eastern wall of Linfen entirely. For our People's Liberation Army, whether attacking the pass or the city, the electric light plant was a major obstacle on our path forward. Therefore, the electric light plant was a must-contend place for both the enemy and us.
    In order to firmly defend the electric light plant, the enemy dug three outer trenches, set up two layers of barbed wire, and one electric fence. The inner edge of the outer trenches was filled with various large and small bunkers. Outside the generator room, two brick walls were built, with bunkers inside and outside the walls. Each bunker complex was surrounded by communication trenches, and there were secret passages between each bunker, as well as a large secret passage directly connecting to Dongguan. The position also had fire support from the city wall. With such complex fortifications, the Yan bandits were confident that it was an unbreakable stronghold; but it could not withstand the People's Liberation Army's successive and overwhelming attacks.
    At dusk on March 27th, the Liberation Army began to bombard fiercely, suppressing the defending enemy's firepower. Our heroic engineers continuously blew up the electric fence and barbed wire. Hu Fengbao's grenade throwing team from the Second Company of the × Unit, which was responsible for the assault mission, quickly approached the trench edge and used volleys of hand grenades to prevent the enemy from showing their heads.
    Li Yinshuo's ladder team carried ladders more than two zhang long down to the outer trench, but the trench was thirty-nine and two-tenths chi deep, and the ladder could not reach. Under the flickering light of exploding hand grenades, the comrades of the assault team saw a loophole in a bunker gun-eye that had been blown open by our direct-fire guns. They quickly erected the ladder below the loophole, and the brave platoon leader, Comrade Liu Deshui, was the first to climb the ladder and enter through the loophole. The enemy launched two counterattacks, but he repelled them both. Although he suffered two serious injuries, he stubbornly completed the task of consolidating the breach, allowing the Seventh Squad to quickly follow in. Company Commander Chu Jinghua expanded the loophole in the bunker and dragged the soldiers up one by one, immediately developing towards the west side. The warriors, having exhausted their hand grenades, picked up the enemy's abandoned hand grenades to pursue and annihilate the enemy. After a fierce battle, the enemies in all three outer trenches were wiped out. We occupied two outer trenches, finally holding on with one outer trench separating us.
    On the night of the 24th, we continued our attack and immediately controlled the northwest and southeast corners of the electric light plant. We also repelled counterattacks from the enemy's 198th Regiment and 196th Regiment, totaling about one regiment, as well as the original defending enemies, and consolidated the positions we had gained. On the 26th, the enemy had been replaced by the 198th Regiment for defense. On that day, our fierce attack began again at dusk. Mao Dexing, the fifth squad leader of the 1315th Unit, First Company, and other seven warriors, under the cover of powerful artillery fire, crossed the outer trench and pounced on the enemy's forward bunker complex, stuffing hand grenades one by one into the bunker gun-eyes, scaring the enemies in two bunkers into shouting for surrender. Then they occupied two more bunkers, and the follow-up troops rushed up, destroying obstacles, clearing roads, and quickly developing into the depth. By about eleven o'clock, we occupied a row of houses on the north side of the electric light plant. At this time, Xu Qichang, the commander of the Yan bandit 66th Division, was frightened and hurriedly ran to the tunnel entrance of Dongguan to personally supervise the battle, and ordered a battalion from the 196th Regiment to come up to reinforce. The artillery fire from the city wall also desperately fired at the electric light plant, launching a fierce battle, filling the sky with smoke and shaking the ground with sound. Our warriors unanimously proposed the slogan: "The position earned with blood will never be allowed to be taken away by the enemy. We will advance one chi and never retreat one cun, resolutely annihilating the counterattacking enemy." For a time, houses collapsed, walls fell, and fortifications were destroyed. Our heroic people's fighters used ammunition boxes filled with soil to build temporary fortifications. The gunpowder smoke made breathing very difficult, and shrapnel covered the ground, but the warriors did not take a step back. The new recruit Zuo Bao was slightly injured twice but did not leave the front line. Comrade Li Xianlu from the Fourth Platoon of the Second Company of the 1315th Unit was stunned by the explosives. The stretcher team carried him halfway when he woke up. Seeing that he was on a stretcher, he immediately jumped off the stretcher and ran back to the battlefield. Comrade Yang Maoli from the Third Squad was injured. The rescue team applied medicine to him and asked him to escort the prisoners back, but he rushed to the front line quickly. Chang Yougui and other five comrades took turns throwing grenades, opening boxes, uncovering, and pulling the fuse. When someone got tired of throwing, another person would replace him. In this way, they repelled the enemy's seven counterattacks in a row. Each time the enemy counterattacked, they left behind piles of corpses. Liang Peihuang was so angry that he removed Sui Weiyan, the commander of the 198th Regiment, from his post and replaced him with Zhang Dongqing, the first battalion commander of the regiment. Soon, Zhang Dongqing was also seriously injured. By March 28th, the 198th Regiment had been completely defeated and had lost its fighting ability. In the end, only twenty-five people escaped back to the city. They were replaced by the First Battalion of the Second Reinforcement Regiment, but they were quickly beaten to a pulp again. After the Second Battalion of the regiment took over the defense, they were so frightened that they shrunk in the tunnel and stubbornly defended the machine room. The brutal Yan bandit 66th Division Commander Xu Qichang had formulated eight killing disciplines, driving soldiers to stubbornly defend the electric light plant, saying: "Only defend to the death, no retreat is allowed, and heads will be chopped off for retreating." One day, an enemy soldier heard our army's slogan and said, "They are shouting slogans over there," and was immediately beheaded for "shaking military morale," and his head was hung at the tunnel entrance as a warning. However, Xu Qichang's beheading and supervision did not hold the electric light plant. After reconnaissance clarified the situation, at twelve o'clock on the night of April 1st, our army organized the final attack. The powerful artillery fire and explosions formed a single sound. The explosions shook the tall chimney, and the tunnels and bunkers were blown up one by one. Our assault team took advantage of the thick smoke and rushed down, annihilating the entire Second Battalion of the Yan bandit Second Reinforcement Regiment in the fortifications and tunnels. The electric light plant thus became the Yan bandit's tomb.

　　争夺电灯厂
  　攻克临汾战斗通讯
    赵恒治
    临汾的电灯厂紧靠东关的北城墙，中间的距离至多有三十米达；同时它与临汾城的东城墙相距也不过一百多米达，这样就使电灯厂在军事上具有很重要的意义。在敌人说来，它是通两道城墙的一个最重要的屏障，电灯厂一失，不特东关难守，而且临汾城的东墙也就暴露无遗；对我解放军说来，不论攻关攻城，电灯厂都是我们前进道路上一个很大的障碍。因此，电灯厂是敌我必争之地。
    敌人为了固守电灯厂，挖了三道外壕，设有两道铁丝网，一道电网。外壕内沿布满了各种大小碉堡，发电的机器房院外又修了两道砖墙，墙里外处处有地堡，房上下处处有工事，每个地堡群又都有交通沟围绕起来，各个碉堡之间都有暗道往还，还有一条大暗道直通东关，阵地上又有城墙上的火力支持。这样复杂的工事，阎匪满以为是一个牢不可破的据点了；但是抵抗不住解放军接二连三、排山倒海的攻击。
    三月二十七日黄昏，解放军开始用猛烈炮火轰击了，压倒了守敌的火力。我英勇的工兵连续炸断了电网铁丝网，担任突击任务的×部二连胡凤保投弹组，飞快的接近壕沿，用排子手榴弹打得敌人不敢露头。
    李银锁架梯组，抬着两丈多长的梯子下到外壕，但壕深三九·二尺，梯子搭不上。在一闪一闪的手榴弹爆炸火光之下，突击队的同志看见一个地堡枪眼被我平射炮轰开了一个缺口，他们迅速的就把梯子竖在缺口下面，勇猛的班长刘得水同志第一个登上梯子，从缺口钻了进去，敌人反扑两次都被他打下去，他虽然负了两处重伤，但仍然顽强的完成了巩固缺口的任务，使七班迅速的跟着冲了进来。连长褚景华将地堡的缺口扩大，又把战士一个个的拖上去，立即向西侧发展。勇士们手榴弹打完了，就拾敌人遗弃的手榴弹追歼敌人，经过一阵激战后，三道外壕的敌人全部肃清了。我们占领了两道外壕，最后隔一道外壕坚持着。
    二十四日夜，我又继续攻击，当即控制了电灯厂的西北角与东南角，并连续打退了敌一九八团和一九六团共约一个团兵力与原有守敌的反扑巩固了已得阵地。二十六日，敌人已换成一九八团防守，当天黄昏我猛烈的攻击又开始了，一三一五部一连五班长毛德兴等七勇士，在强大炮火掩护下，越过外壕，猛扑敌前沿地堡群，把手榴弹一个个的塞进地堡的枪眼里，吓得两个地堡敌人叫着缴枪。接着又占领了两个地堡，后续部队随着冲上来，摧毁障碍，修通道路，迅速的向纵深发展。至十一时许，我占领了电灯厂北面一排房子，这时吓坏了的阎匪六六师师长徐其昌，仓惶的跑到东关地道口亲自督战，又命一九六团一个营上来增援，城墙上的炮火也拼命的向电灯厂发射，展开了一场激烈的争夺战，打得烟雾满天，响声震地。我勇士们一致提出口号：“流血换来的阵地，绝不让敌人夺去，能进一尺不退一寸，坚决消灭反扑的敌人”。一时屋塌了，墙倒了，工事打没了，我英勇的人民战士就用子弹箱装上土垒起来做成临时的工事，火药浓烟熏得呼吸非常费力，炸弹片蒙住了地面，勇士们没有退后一步。新战士左保小负伤两次不下火线。一三一五部二连四排李贤路同志被炸药震昏迷了，担架队把他抬到半路上他才醒过来，看见自己是在担架上，他马上跳下担架又跑上战场。三班杨茂李同志负了伤，抢救组给他上了药，叫他往回送俘虏，但他却飞快地冲上了火线。常有贵等五同志轮班的投弹、开箱、揭盖拉火线，谁投累了就另换一个人投，这样连续打退了敌人七次反扑。敌人每一次反扑都是遗尸累累，气得梁培璜将一九八团团长睢维严撤了职，由该团一营长张东清代理，不久张东清又负了重伤。至三月二十八日，一九八团已被打得完全丧失了战斗力，最后剩下二十五个人逃回城去了。换来了补训二团的第一营，但很快又被打得焦头烂额。该团第二营接防后，吓得缩在地道里和机器房死守。残暴的阎匪六六师师长徐其昌订有八杀纪律，驱使士兵固守电灯厂，说：“只准死守，不准后退，后退就砍头。”有一天一个敌军士兵听见我军口号，说了一句“那边喊口号了”，马上就被杀了头，说是“动摇军心”，并且把头挂在暗道口示众。但是徐其昌的杀头和督战，并没有守住了电灯厂。当侦察清楚了情况后，四月一日夜十二时我军组织最后的攻击。强大的炮火与爆破声响成一片，爆炸声震荡得大烟筒直摇幌，地道碉堡一个个的被炸塌，我突击队趁着浓烟猛冲下去，把阎匪补训二团第二营全部歼灭在工事和地道里，电灯厂就这样成了阎匪的坟墓。
