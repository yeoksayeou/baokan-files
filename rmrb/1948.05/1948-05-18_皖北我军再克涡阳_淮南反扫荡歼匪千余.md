Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan, 16th: Delayed news: Part of the People's Local Armed Forces of the Yu Wansu Military Region recovered Guoyang City in northern Anhui on April 18, annihilating the Guoyang Security Regiment and more than 800 enemy reinforcements. This included capturing over 500 enemies, including the battalion commander, seizing 12 light machine guns, over 300 long and short guns, 54 warhorses, and a radio station. Another unit of local armed forces ambushed the 153rd Regiment of the 74th Division of bandits (rebuilt after being annihilated by us) on the Guoyang-Mengcheng highway at Xiyangji the next day, killing and wounding over 80 enemy soldiers and capturing over 60 alive. They seized one heavy machine gun, seven light machine guns, one 60mm mortar, and dozens of rifles. On the 20th, this unit also annihilated a group of local Chiang bandits looting grain west of Guoyang City, seizing 34 rifles.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: Over the past 40 days, the military and civilians of Huainan have fiercely attacked the "mopping-up" operations of Chiang Kai-shek's 13 regiments, annihilating over a thousand bandits and achieving a preliminary victory in the counter-"mopping-up" campaign. After our army successively captured the important towns of Tongcheng and Gucheng between Tianchang and Xuyi in late February and early March, our troops approached the Yangtze River, threatening the bandit nest of Nanjing. Chiang Kai-shek hastily drew the 152nd Brigade and 186th Brigade of the 63rd Division of his garrison troops from Nanjing, and the 40th Brigade and 108th Brigade of the 25th Division from the Dabie Mountains. They were coordinated with the 188th Brigade and 563rd Regiment of the 46th Division, and the Fifth and Sixth Security Regiments of the puppet Anhui Province, and the Seventh Traffic Police Corps, totaling 13 regiments. Starting from March 16th, they launched a frantic "mopping-up" operation against the east and west areas of the Jinpu Railway in Huainan, attempting to force us to withdraw from the area. With the cooperation of the broad masses, our army has always persisted in fighting on the spot, and has rapidly annihilated and captured Chiang bandits. Up to April 21st, we have fought more than 50 battles, annihilating more than 500 regular and local Chiang bandits, and capturing more than ten enemy strongholds, including Zhuzhen, Outang, Xinjizi, Zhanjigang, and Jiaotangqiao. We seized four small cannons, eight machine guns, more than 190 long and short guns, and a radio station.
