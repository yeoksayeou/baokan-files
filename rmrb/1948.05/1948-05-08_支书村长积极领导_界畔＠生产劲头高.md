　　Branch Secretary and Village Chief Actively Lead
    Production Enthusiasm High in Jiepan Village
    [Pingshun News] Jiepan Village in the Sixth District is a scattered mountain village consisting of thirteen natural villages. Each person has an average of one and a half mu of land, which is not enough to eat even in good years. They rely entirely on digging slopes, planting vegetables, and codonopsis pilosula to make ends meet. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the people understood it after studying it. Everyone believes that there are no big landlords in this place. The few rich peasants there were, also went through rent reduction, anti-traitor, and liquidation movements, which were thoroughly dealt with. Waiting for equal distribution would not yield much, and the deficit households have generally been filled up. Only a few households are slightly higher, but not by much, so production has never slackened. After studying the Border Region Government's proclamation of "whoever sows, reaps," and the district office convened an expanded cadre meeting to arrange production, voluntary combination, rectification of mutual aid, and cadres reviewed their past coercive command style, the masses became even more enthusiastic about production. Branch Secretary Zhang Jintang (poor peasant) and Village Chief Yang Shuangze (middle peasant) divided their labor and reorganized the village's mutual aid teams and textile groups on a voluntary basis. The masses happily sent all the fertilizer to the fields, reinforced the banks, and harrowed all the land. Zhang Jintang proposed: "To get rich, grow more codonopsis pilosula, spin more cotton, and weave more cloth." And he publicized in the mutual aid teams: "Last year, our area had a poor harvest, so we must work hard. We must plant more vegetables and sow early to prepare bran and vegetables for supplementation." Under the supervision and leadership of the cadres, Zhao Suishuan, the captain of the First Production Brigade (middle peasant), said: "The Land Law Outline stipulates that it does not harm the interests of middle peasants, so I must work hard." He led the six groups of the First Brigade to sow 81.4 mu of codonopsis pilosula. Poor peasant Sang Xinshun said: "Last year, I grew codonopsis pilosula, dug up one mu, and sold it for 122,000 yuan. I bought a donkey at the Hongtijuan meeting on the first day of the third lunar month. This year, I am growing 3.2 mu of codonopsis pilosula, plus the 2.9 mu that I didn't finish digging last year, for a total of 6.1 mu. I plan to sell it this autumn and exchange it for another good donkey." After the district office convened a production meeting on March 26th, poor peasant woman Zhang Gaiguo reorganized the textile group again, all on a voluntary basis, combining machines to weave cloth. Although there are fewer people in the group than last year, the spinning and weaving are very energetic. Group leader Yang Xiangze said: "Last year, I earned 100,000 yuan from spinning and weaving, plus 50,000 yuan from my family, and bought a donkey." Han Lanze said: "My man is often sick and cannot work. In the past, without a mutual aid team, I couldn't plant the land. When hoeing, I could only weed, and by autumn, the weeds were taller than the crops. Now that we have a mutual aid team, shouldn't I be better off? People in the mutual aid help me plant the land, and I do exchange labor for them in spinning and weaving, and it's not even enough! Last year's poor harvest meant that the grain we harvested was not enough to eat. In the winter, I spun and wove cloth, and besides wearing it, I sold six zhang of cloth and exchanged it for one dan and two dou of rice." The whole village is now voluntarily organized. They plan to strive to complete the sowing before the fifth day of the fourth lunar month, calculating both live and dead work. According to the statistics of the mutual aid teams in each natural village on the 30th night, the village plans to plant 475 mu of millet and 471 mu of corn. 415 mu of millet and 221 mu of corn have already been sown (including 26 mu of 811 millet and 27 mu of Golden Queen corn). 262 mu of miscellaneous grains have been planted on the slopes, 138 mu of turnips have been planted, and 89 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed.

　　支书村长积极领导
    界畔＠生产劲头高
    【平顺消息】六区界畔＠村是个山野散漫村庄，十三个自然村。每人平均一亩半地，好年景也不够吃。全赖刨坡地、种菜蔬、党参接济。土地法大纲公布后，老百姓学习都懂了，大家认为这地方没有大地主，有几户富农，也经过减租反奸清算填补运动，斗彻底了。等待平分也分不上多少，窟窿户大体上也填起来了，只有个别户高点。也不高多少，所以生产上就一直没有松劲。又经过学习边府谁种谁收的布告，再加上区署召开扩干会布置生产，自愿结合，整顿互助，干部检讨，去掉过去的强迫命令作风，群众对生产更起了劲。支书张金堂（贫雇）与村长杨双则（中农）二人分工领导，把全村互助组、纺织组，自愿结合整理了一下。群众都高兴着把肥全部送到地里，岸都垒起，地全部耙过。张金堂提出：“要得富，多养党参、多纺棉花、多织布。”并在互助组里宣传：去年咱这地方歉收，非好好劳动不行。要多种菜蔬，早下种，准备糠菜来补助。在干部督促领导下，生产第一大队队长中农赵随拴说：“土地法大纲上规定不损害中农利益，我可要好好干哩。”他领导一大队六个组下种了党参八十一亩四。贫农桑心顺说：“我去年养的党参，刨了一亩，卖了十二万二。今年三月初一虹梯关会上买了一头驴。今年又养党参三亩二，带上去年没刨完的二亩九，共六亩一，计划今年秋天卖了，再换一头好驴。贫农妇女张改果自三月二十六号区署召开生产会后，又重新把纺织组整顿一下，都是自愿结组，合机织布，没有去年组里人多，纺花织布可起劲。组长杨箱则说：“我去年纺织赚了十万元，配合家中五万元，买了一头驴。”韩兰则说：“我家男人时常有病，不能劳动，过去没有互助组，就种不上地，锄地时只是我薅苗拔草，到秋天草比庄稼还高。现在有了互助组，我该不是好啦？人家互助给我种地，我纺织上给人家变工，还用不了哩！去年歉收，我家打的粮食不够吃，冬天纺织，除了穿还卖了六丈布，换了一石二斗米。”全村现都自愿组织起来，死工活折，计划阴历四月初五日前争取完成下种。根据三十号黑夜各自然小村互助组统计，全村计划种谷四七五亩，种玉茭四七一亩，已下种谷四一五亩，玉茭二二一亩（内包括八一一谷二六亩，金皇后二七亩），种坡地杂粮二六二亩，栽蔓菁一三八亩，开荒八十九亩。（王德全、郭存财）
