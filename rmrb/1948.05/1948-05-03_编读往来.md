　　It is incorrect to divide middle peasants into upper, middle, and lower categories.
　　Editor:
　　In the news about class division in Shilidian and Baicuo Village published in the People's Daily on March 13th and April 1st, I have some questions regarding the issue of middle peasants: The Outline Land Law states that there are three types of middle peasants: well-to-do middle peasants, middle peasants, and lower-middle peasants. However, in the class division in Shilidian, there are no "upper-middle" or "lower-middle" peasants. The work team told the masses that these classes would not be divided. In the class division in Baicuo Village, there are upper-middle peasants but no lower-middle peasants. How should this middle peasant issue be handled? (Jiang Yun, reader from Linxian Public Security Bureau)

　　Comrade Jiang Yun:
　　The Outline Land Law does not mention "middle peasants having well-to-do middle peasants, middle peasants, and lower-middle peasants." It is correct that Shilidian did not divide "upper-middle peasants" and "lower-middle peasants." It was a mistake to have "upper-middle peasants" as a component in the class division in Baicuo Village. According to the central government's class division regulations, farmers who have some exploitation but do not exceed one-fourth of their total income should still be considered part of the middle peasant class and their component should be defined as "well-to-do middle peasants." It is important to note that there must be slight exploitation to be classified as a well-to-do middle peasant. Do not simply look at land exceeding the average or just at a prosperous lifestyle. The classification of class should not be confused with the work of drawing from the better-off to help the worse-off. In the process of drawing from the better-off to help the worse-off, some middle peasants still need to be allocated more land, some remain unchanged, and some can have some land taken away with their consent. However, when dividing classes, middle peasants should not be divided into "upper," "middle," and "lower" based on the amount of land.

　　Are apprentices handicraftsmen?
　　Editor:
　　We have encountered some problems in the recent rectification of trade union organizations, and we are writing to you now for your help in answering them.
　　1. Dentists, tailors, watchmakers, and barbers have been practicing these crafts for many years, have the means of production, and have shops (business premises). They rely entirely on their own labor to maintain their families. Some employ apprentices. Are these people handicraftsmen? Are they considered workers? Can they join the trade union and be counted as workers?
　　2. After working for many years and earning money, they joined with fellow workers after liberation to establish a factory (such as an iron factory). They have shares (such as 100,000 to 300,000 yuan), participate in the main labor in the factory (such as lathe and turning lathe technicians), have their own labor shares, and also employ several workers (workers also have labor shares). They also serve as managers. Are they still considered workers? Can they join the trade union?
　　3. After liberation, the owners, fearing struggle, promoted shop assistants to shareholders (money shares or labor shares). Those who take money shares do not earn salaries. Are they considered owners and cannot participate in the shop employees' union? Also, if the family's original component was landlord or rich peasant and has already been struggled against, and they have been shop assistants for more than three years, can their personal component be changed? Can they join the shop employees' union? (Handan City Federation of Trade Unions)

　　Preparatory Committee of Handan City Federation of Trade Unions:
　　1. Dentists, tailors, watchmakers, barbers, and others are all handicraft laborers and are not considered workers. Because they possess a small number of tools and directly use their own labor to meet consumers' needs as the entire or main source of their livelihood. However, the small number of craftsmen employed in dental clinics, tailor shops, watch shops, and barber shops, who do not have tools and rely entirely on selling their labor and skills as their entire or main source of livelihood, are workers and should join the trade union. Handicraft laborers are an important part of the working people. In a new democratic country, their interests should be firmly protected, and they should be actively helped to promote improvements if they are beneficial to the national economy.
　　2. After working for many years and earning money, they joined with others after liberation to open a small-scale iron factory, they have shares, and they serve as managers. This situation is no longer considered workers. According to its nature, although using machine production, and they participate in the main labor, they should still be considered handicraft laborers and cannot participate in the trade union. The workers they employ should participate in the trade union. If the apprentices and workers they employ are the main part of their production and business, and they only have incidental labor or only occupy a supervisory and management position, they should be considered handicraft capitalists.
　　3. Since liberation, the owners, fearing struggle, promoted shop assistants to shareholders (money shares or labor shares). Those who take money shares do not earn salaries. Are they considered owners? Since this method is because the owner fears struggle and distributes property to the shop assistants, this is abnormal and unreasonable. Whether it needs to be re-handled, please consider according to the specific situation. But in general, after shop assistants are promoted to shareholders, they should be considered one of the owners and cannot participate in the shop employees' union.
　　4. If the shop assistant's family's original component was landlord or rich peasant, and they have been shop assistants for more than three years, their component still needs to be handled according to each person's specific situation. People who are from landlord families and have been shop assistants for a full year before the establishment of the local democratic regime, or have been shop assistants for a full five years after the establishment of the local democratic regime, should have their component changed to shop assistants. People who are from old-style rich peasant families and have been shop assistants for a full year before the establishment of the local democratic regime, or have been shop assistants for a full three years after the establishment of the local democratic regime, should have their component changed to shop assistants. Shop assistants are part of the working class. People from landlord and rich peasant families who meet the above conditions should all join the shop employees' union.

　　"Changing the gods but not the temple" in industry and commerce. Resolutely return to the original owner's operation.
　　Editor:
　　This time the Land Law proposes to firmly protect industry and commerce. If the industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants have already been confiscated during the mass movement and handed over to the village peasants' association for reception, and the buying and selling are still operating as usual, but only the owner has been changed, and the goods and materials have been distributed to the masses to top up the shares, should this business still be returned to the landlord? If it is to be returned, what about the industry and commerce that has been struggled against and the assets have been distributed to the masses for use? (Song Chuntang, Xingtai Education Section)

　　Comrade Song Chuntang:
　　The industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants that have been confiscated during the mass movement should be firmly returned. If the buying and selling are still operating as usual, but only the owner has been changed, and the masses have topped up the shares, that is, the so-called "changing the gods but not the temple", or have already been distributed to the masses but have not been used up, should all be unconditionally returned to the original owner for operation; if they have already been used up, then the method of pursuing and compensating should be decided according to the situation, the government can also give the original owner low-interest or interest-free loans, and must make them able to resume business. The Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee and the Central Bureau's instructions on industrial and commercial policies are very clear, and all localities should resolutely implement them when dealing with these issues.

专栏：编读往来

　　中农划成上、中、下是不对的。编辑同志：
    人民日报三月十三日及四月一日登的什里店与白错村划阶级消息中，在中农问题上我自己有一点疑问：土地法大纲上说中农有富裕中农、中农与下中农三种，但在什里店的划阶级中就无有“上中”与“下中”，工作组向群众说就不划这个阶级。白错村的划阶级又有上中而无下中，这中农问题究竟该如何？（林县公安局读者江云）江云同志：
    土地法大纲上其中并没说到“中农有富裕中农、中农与下中农三种”。什里店划阶级不划“上中农”与“下中农”是对的。白错村划阶级中有“上中农”一个成份，是弄错了。应该一律按照中央划阶级规定，把虽有一些剥削，但不超过总收入四分之一的农民，仍认为中农的一部分，定成份为“富裕中农”。要注意的是一定要有轻微剥削才能划为富裕中农，不能只看土地超过平均数或只看生活富裕。不能把划阶级和抽补工作混淆起来。在抽补中，中农有一部分人还要补进土地，有一部分保持不动，有一部分经过本人同意才可以抽出一些土地；但在划阶级时，就不应按土地多少而把中农划分为“上”“中”“下”三种。

    学徒是否手工业者？编辑同志：
    我们最近在整顿工会组织中发生一些问题，现在写去请你们帮助给解答一下。
    一、镶牙匠、裁缝、钟表匠、理发匠做这些手艺多年，都有生产手段，并有铺面（做生意的门面），全靠自己劳动维持家庭生活，个别的雇有小徒弟，这些人是否即手工业生产者？算不算工人？是否可以参加职工会算为职工？
    二、劳动多年挣了钱，解放后与工友合股成立工厂（如铁工厂），自己有股金（如十万——三十万元），参加厂里主要劳动（如车床、旋床技工），自己有人力股，又雇用几个工人（工人也有人力股）自己兼经理，这是否还算工人？是否能参加职工会？
    三、解放以后，东家怕斗争，将店员上升为股东（钱股或人力股），顶钱股者不挣薪金，是否即算东家，能不能参加店员工会？又家里原是地主富农成份，业已被斗，自己当店员超过三年，本人成份是否可以改变？能不能参加店员工会？（邯郸市职工联合会）
    邯郸市职工联合会筹委会：
    一、镶牙匠、缝衣、钟表匠、理发匠等这些人都是手工业劳动者，不算是工人。因为他们占有少量的工具，直接用自己的劳动满足消费者的需要，作为他们全部或主要生活的来源。但镶牙店、缝衣店、钟表店、理发店所雇用的少数的手艺人，他们没有工具，全靠出卖劳动和手艺作为其全部或主要生活来源，这才是工人，应该参加职工会。手工业劳动者是劳动人民的一个重要部分，在新民主国家中，他们的利益应该受到坚决的保护，凡属有益于国民经济者，均应积极帮助他们推广改进。
    二、劳动多年挣了钱，解放后与人合股开小规模铁工厂，自己有股金，自己兼经理。这种情况已不算是工人，按其性质说，虽用机器生产，但自己参加主要劳动，仍应是手工业劳动者，不能参加职工会。其所雇用的工人则应参加职工会。如果所雇用的学徒、工人为其生产业务中的主体，本人只有附带劳动，或只居于监督管理地位者，则应认为手工业资本家。
    三、解放以来，东家怕斗争，将店员上升为股东（钱股或人力股），顶钱股者不挣薪金，是否即算东家？这种办法既然是因为东家怕斗争，而把财产分散给店员，这是不正常不合理的。是否需要从新处理，请根据具体情况加以考虑。但在一般情况下，店员上升为股东后，便应该认为是东家之一，不能参加店员工会。
    四、店员家里原是地主、富农成份，其本人当店员超过三年，其成份仍须按各人具体情况加以处理。地主出身的人，在当地民主政权成立以前已经过店员生活满一年的，或在当地民主政权成立以后已经过店员生活满五年的，应改变其成份为店员。旧式富农出身的人，在当地民主政权成立以前已经过店员生活满一年的，或在当地民主政权成立以后已经过店员生活满三年的，便须改变其成份为店员。店员是工人阶级的一部分，地主、富农出身的人，凡合于上述条件者，均应参加店员工会。
    换神不换庙的工商业　坚决退还原主经营编辑同志：
    这次土地法上提出坚决保护工商业，如在大运动时把地主富农的工商业已经没收了，归村农会接收，买卖还照常营业，只是把东家换了换，把货物资财已分给群众顶了股金，这买卖是否还得退给地主？要得退的话，还有斗了的工商业已把资财分给群众用了，这怎办？（邢台教育科宋春棠）宋春棠同志：
    大运动时没收了的地主富农工商业，应坚决退还，若买卖还照常营业，只是换了东家，给群众顶了股金，即所谓换神不换庙的，或已分配给群众而未消耗光的，均应无条件的退还给原业主经营；若是已经消耗了，则应看情况决定追补和补偿的方法，政府也可给原业主以低利或无利贷款，一定要使他们能重新恢复营业。中央局给太岳区党委指示及中央局关于工商业政策的指示中说的很明白，各地在处理这些问题时应坚决执行。
