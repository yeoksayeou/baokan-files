[Jilu Yu News] The Fanxian County Party Committee, at the district secretary meeting held on May 7th, inspected the recent work and found that serious chaotic phenomena existed universally in each district, hindering the progress of production work. In many villages, individual careerists and revenge-seekers were found creating factions and opposing village cadres. In villages such as Zhuzhuang, Chendingzhuang, Xinzhuang, Liulou, and Jilou, some village cadres who were overthrown during the land reform seized upon some errors of the current village cadres and took the opportunity to retaliate. They seized upon the current production difficulties of some of the masses and incited the masses to settle accounts. For example, in the accounting in Zhuzhuang, landlords, rich peasants, and wrongly criticized middle peasants were called as witnesses to report how much property and grain they had been struggled against, and old accounts from the time of the democratic livelihood struggle were also brought up for settlement now, allowing landlords to take the opportunity to retaliate. One landlord in Zhuzhuang, who had a little bit of beans taken from his earthenware pot during the struggle, said that he had a *dou* [a unit of dry measure] taken. Due to the chaos in the village order, thefts occurred in individual villages. One ox was stolen from Fanduanlou in the Second District, and 60,000 yuan was stolen from Daokou in the Fourth District. There were also thefts of trees, sheep, and grain. Only a few village cadres who had good relations with the masses, such as those in Wuqiao and Guomakou villages, were still actively leading production. However, due to a lack of understanding of the spirit of party rectification, they were also very distressed, feeling they had no way forward and were afraid of retaliation. The situation was similar in villages such as Zhangqingying. Most village cadres and party members, due to their undemocratic work style, issuing too many coercive commands, and taking too many fruits, as well as a lack of understanding of the spirit of party rectification, were afraid of rectification, afraid of having to give up the fruits, afraid of being investigated, and afraid of publicizing the party, so they all lay down and waited for rectification. Some village cadres requested to resign. Wu Jiewu, the head of the East Wu Farmers' Association, wrote a petition requesting not to continue, and Luo Jiyuan, the village chief of Mazhuang, firmly refused to be a cadre, fearing retaliation from revenge-seekers and asking the leadership for a way out. In addition, a very small number who had committed more serious mistakes were afraid but were actively frightening the masses, creating factions, and stirring up trouble. Generally, village cadres believed: "The district cadres who came back from the meeting have changed, they are being cold and slow." After the party rectification, some comrades in the county and district leadership who did not participate in the party rectification felt distressed and had no way forward; others who participated in the party rectification believed that the old village cadres and old organizations were a black mess, and discriminated against and avoided them. In the Second and Third Districts, village cadres were not consulted during loan distribution; they were only used to complete formalities. Some were even afraid of falling into the "village cadre line" or "protecting village cadres," and watched some things that harmed the interests of the masses without doing anything. For example, when factions were causing trouble in the village, they knew it was manipulated by a small number of revenge-seekers but did nothing to avoid being accused of "protecting village cadres." This anarchic state seriously hampered the progress of production work.

The County Party Committee, based on this inspection, decided to correct the chaos, awaken the village cadres and party members, dispel their concerns, make them recognize that the spirit of party rectification is to treat diseases and save people, and actively rise up to lead production and do more good deeds for the people; at the same time, expose the provocative activities of a small number of revenge-seekers, persuade the masses not to be fooled, emphasize that production is the most important thing, solve the difficulties of the masses in production, and vigorously carry out production to overcome the famine.

　　范县县委检查混乱现象
  　区干帮助村干领导生产
    解除顾虑指出出路郭麻口村干转变
    【冀鲁豫消息】范县县委在五月七号召开的区书会议上，检查了最近一段工作，各区普遍存在着严重的混乱现象，阻碍着生产工作的进行。不少村庄发现个别野心报复分子在村里制造宗派，反村干。如朱庄、陈丁庄、新庄、刘楼、吉楼等村，一部分土改中被打下去的村干，抓住现有村干的一些错误，乘机活动报复。他们抓住一部分群众目前的生产困难，鼓动群众起来算帐。如朱庄在算帐中，叫地主富农以及被错斗的中农当证人，去报被斗了多少东西和粮食，把民主民生斗争时的旧帐也拿到现在来算，地主也就乘机报复。朱庄有一个地主，斗争时拿了他瓦盆里放的一点豆，他就说有一斗。由于村内秩混乱，个别村庄发生偷盗现象。二区范段楼被偷走一个牛，四区道口被偷走钱六万元，有被偷树、羊和粮食的。只有少数和群众连系较好的，如吴桥、郭麻口等村村干，还在积极领导生产。但由于对整党精神不了解，也很苦恼，感到无路，光怕报复。张青营等村，也是如此。大部分村干党员，由于作风不民主强迫命令多占果实，同时对整党的精神不了解，怕整怕倒果实，怕清算怕公开党，于是都躺倒睡觉，支着架子等整。有的村干要求辞职，东吴农会长吴介武写呈请书要求不干，马庄村长罗纪元坚决不当干部了，害怕报复分子报复，要求领导上给个路。另外有极少数犯的错误较严重的害怕，但又在积极的活动吓唬群众，制造宗派拨弄是非。一般村干认为：“开会回来的区干部变啦，冷吹慢打的。”县区领导上从整党后，一部分没有参加整党的同志感到苦恼没有路；另一部分参加整党的同志认为老村干老组织黑漆一团，歧视与避开他们。二、三区贷款中不叫村干过问，只有利用村干办个手续，甚至有的怕落“村干路线”，“包庇村干”，而看着一些危害群众利益的事情不管不问。如村里闹宗派，明知是少数报复分子操纵，为了避免落“包庇村干”而放任不管。这种无政府状态，严重的妨害着生产工作的进行。
    县委根据这一检查，决定纠正混乱唤醒村干党员，解除顾虑，使其认清整党精神是治病救人，而积极的起来领导生产，为人民多作好事；同时对少数报复分子的挑拨活动予以揭发，说服群众不要上当，还是生产要紧，并解决群众生产中的困难，大力进行生产渡荒。
