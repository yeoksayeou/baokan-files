Seeing Compensation for Wrongly Struggled Middle Peasant
　　Wang Yonghai Works with Enthusiasm
　　[Gaoping News] Wang Yonghai, a middle peasant from Jianning Village, Fifth District, Gaoping, has been working since he was nine years old pulling the bellows and learned to make nails and work the land at fourteen. Now thirty-five years old, he hasn’t changed. His family of seven relied on him making iron and working the land in 1939. With the money he saved, he bought seventeen and a half mu of land, three rooms of flat houses, and five rooms of two-story buildings (three rooms of the two-story building were contributed when filling in and compensating last year). Last winter, the graves of his grandfather and father were dug up by a nearby village. He was full of anger but didn't dare to say anything, let alone go to the farmers' association. After the Land Law Outline was released, hearing that various villages had confiscated this family and that family, and seeing with his own eyes that twenty-nine families in his village had their grain, beans, livestock, furniture, and other items confiscated, he became even more worried. His mother and wife were afraid of being struggled and cried, complaining, "You yourself don't learn to be good, you always have to be moving around, you're just born without the right stuff, only knowing how to work yourself to death." His wife said, "If you had moved around less back then, wouldn't you be a good person now, one who gets to divide things? I might as well make you some noodles and some meat, let you enjoy it for a couple of days, so you don't suffer for the rest of your life." In this situation, the whole family hesitated to be ruthless but couldn't bear to part with things. They ate several jin of white flour and more than two jin of meat, and he had no mind to work, no mind to keep the family going. Sometimes when he went to the land, he did a bad job instead of a good one. In mid-April this year, when Jianning Village compensated and returned items to those who had been wrongly struggled in the past winter and spring at a general meeting, Wang Yonghai not only started working as usual but also repeatedly sought out the staff to tell them about the grievances in his heart, demanding that those who dug up his grave admit their mistake. He also said, "Chairman Mao truly has ways to help working people." Wang Yonghai's production enthusiasm is now very high, believing that even if his village is evenly divided, his houses and land will not be divided from him. (Yang Jun)

    看到补偿错斗中农
    王永孩劳动有劲了
    【高平消息】高平五区建宁村中农王永孩，从九岁上拉风匣，十四岁时学打钉子做地。今年卅五岁没有改样，全家七口人，他卅九年以打铁做地，积蓄的钱买地有十七亩半，平房三间，楼房五间（前年填平补齐时，献楼房三间在外）。去年冬天，自己祖父、父亲的坟墓被附近村刨开，一肚子气，也不敢吭，更不敢到农会去说。到土地法大纲下来，听到各村没收了这家，没收了那家，又亲眼看到本村廿九家的谷子、豆子、牲口、家具等物件被没收后，自己更加发愁，母亲妻子怕斗，哭着怨他说：“你自己不学好，成天要动弹，天生是个没材料的人，只会下死力气”。他老婆说：“那会儿少动弹点，这会儿不是当了分东西的好人了，不如我给你做些面，做些肉，好吃上两天，也莫受了一辈子。”在这样情况下，全家下狠心又不舍得，吃了几斤白面二斤多肉，成天是没心思劳动，没心思再过家了。有时上上地，也是做孬地不做好地。今年四月十几，建宁全村对去冬今春乱动错斗的户口，在大会上给了补偿与退还时，王永孩不但开始照常劳动，而且再三的找工作人员诉说他肚里的冤枉，叫找刨他墓的人承认错误。他还说：“毛主席真正能给劳动人想办法。”王永孩现在生产情绪很高，认为他村平分时，也平不了自己的房地了。          （杨俊）
