    Nanshanhou Studies Instructions to Correct "Leftist" Deviations
    Masses Say: "This Really Suits Us Old Peasants' Hearts."
    [Taihang News] The masses in Nanshanhou Village, in the Third District of Huguan, warmly support the Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu’s instructions to the Taiyue District Committee to correct "Leftist" deviations. Since stopping the land redistribution and turning to spring plowing, the mood of various strata in the village has not been completely stable. Some middle peasants are still not enthusiastic about production. They are skeptical of the talk about "uniting the middle peasants" during meetings, with some even misunderstanding it as "uniting in production mutual aid, and being struggled against during future land redistribution," because they see that eight middle-peasant households in the village still wear "feudal" hats. In addition, the masses who were casually labeled as "special agents" in the past are still in a state of ideological turmoil. A few days ago, the work team held a village meeting at night and loudly read the important instructions of the Central Bureau to the Taiyue District Committee on "resolutely correcting the 'Leftist' adventurism" published in the newspaper. After a detailed explanation, the men and women, old and young, especially the middle peasants present, felt as if they had taken a "reassurance pill" and were in high spirits, eagerly vying to speak. The middle peasant Guo Baoquan has always been reluctant to attend meetings. This time, he asked his son to go, but after lying down, he heard that the newspaper about uniting the middle peasants was going to be read, and he immediately got up to listen. The middle peasant Li Jiaze said: "Since the Land Law came down, I have been wasting time not working in the fields. In previous years, I had surplus grain, but this year it is not enough to eat. The work team has repeatedly said to unite the middle peasants, but I did not believe it, and I planned to just plant the spring crops haphazardly. Tonight, after listening to the newspaper, my thinking is truly clear! Although I started late this year, I will work hard in the future and be sure to plant better than others. I still have five <i>dou</i> and eight <i>yi yi</i> of millet seeds, and I will take them out to exchange for others to plant!" The middle peasant Li Heihaizi has been frowning under the pressure of the "feudal middle peasant" hat for several years, and even "gave away" part of his land. After listening to the newspaper, he was very happy and said, "I haven't been so happy in years! From now on, it is only right to speak the truth and labor diligently. Watch my production tomorrow!" The Women's Rescue Chairperson Lü Gaihua said: "The newspaper read tonight really suits us old peasants' hearts. No one can have special privileges, the 'special agent' hats that were casually put on must be removed, and the control over landlords must be cancelled. From now on, they will have to work hard!" Li Lifu excitedly said: "From now on, there will be clear regulations, not only can we not struggle against middle peasants, but we must also compensate for wrong struggles. Also, the industry and commerce of anyone must be protected, which is beneficial to us peasants. The Communist Party's policies are so good that they are stronger than using 100,000 troops to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and can win back the people in the enemy-occupied areas." Some said: "If this instruction had come down earlier, every household in our village would have moved earlier, and we could have guaranteed to harvest an extra 150 <i>shi</i> of coarse grain." Some expressed confidence, saying: "From now on, we must cultivate the seeds well and not worry about harvesting three more <i>sheng</i> of grain per <i>mu</i>."

    南山后学习纠“左”指示
    群众说：“这真合咱老农民的心。”
    【太行消息】壶关三区南山后村群众热烈拥护中共晋冀鲁豫中央局给太岳区党委的纠“左”指示。该村自停止填补转向春耕以来，各阶层情绪并未完全稳定，部分中农生产仍不起劲，他们对开会时说的“团结中农”表示怀疑，有的甚至误解为“生产互助中团结，将来填补时还要挨斗”，因为眼看的全村有八户中农仍戴“封建”帽子；另外过去随便给戴上“特务”帽子的群众，思想仍很动荡。日前，工作组于夜晚召开村民大会，高声读了报上登载的中央局给太岳区党委“坚决纠正左倾冒险主义”的重要指示，并详细解释后，到会的男女老少，特别是中农群众听着，象是吃了一付“定心丸”，情绪很高，争相热烈发言。中农郭保全素来不好参加开会，这一次是叫他儿去开会；他躺倒后，听说要念团结中农的报，马上起来就去听。中农李家则说：“自土地法下来后，我就一直没上地生产光浪费，往年有余粮，今年不够吃，工作组再三的说团结中农，我也不相信，春耕也打算瞎胡种上就算。今夜听了报，我思想真算通啦！今年虽说动的迟，往后努力，一定要比别人种的好。我还有五斗八一一谷种，要拿出来换给大家种！”中农李黑孩几年来被“封建中农”的帽子压的愁眉苦脸，并曾把地“送”出过一部分。听了报后，非常高兴，他说：“几年来数今天痛快哩！今后要是说真理，劳动才行，明天看看我的生产吧！”妇救主席吕改花说：“今夜念的这报，真合咱老农民的心思，谁也不能有特权，随便给带上特务帽子的要摘掉，对地主取消了管制，今后他就要好好劳动啦！”李里付兴奋的说：“以后有了明白规定，不但不能斗中农，斗错的还得补偿。还有不管任何人的工商业都要保护，这是对咱农民有利。共产党这样政策真好，对打蒋介石比用十万军队还强，能把敌占区的人都争取回来。”有的说：“这个指示要早下来，咱村家家早动弹，保险能多打一百五十石粗粮。”有的充满着信心表示：“从今后要好好养种，每亩不愁多打三升粮。”
