Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 14th: Pingxi Sub-district of the Beiyue District recently convened a meeting to reorganize mass 勤务 (qinwu, service/corvee labor), and correct the serious phenomenon of wasting civilian labor. The current problems with 勤务 burdens in the district are as follows: (1) The burdens in various places are very uneven. For example, the 勤务 burden in Laishui and other places is heavier than in other counties. Also, due to localism in various villages, the actual number of people and livestock are not reported to the transportation station, resulting in the phenomenon that the burden on counties, districts, villages, and individuals is sometimes light and sometimes heavy. (2) Illegal mobilization is quite serious. For example, cadres are mobilized to pick up and drop off family members, transport luggage, and even transport vegetables for organs. According to incomplete statistics from Xizhai Village in Wancheng last year, the number of illegal mobilizations accounted for 10% of the total mobilizations. (3) The numbers for 代耕 (daigeng, plowing on behalf of) are inaccurate. Because 代耕 is assigned by the villages themselves and reported to the station at the end of the month, the villages mostly underreport the actual amount due to localism. (4) The location of the transportation stations is not suitable. Some villages are more than 50 li (Chinese mile, about 0.5 km) away from the station, and it takes three days to go to the station for work, which wastes a lot of time. Some cadres do not have a good grasp of the 平工 (pinggong, equal work) and 齐工 (qigong, unified work) systems, which affects the balanced burden on the villages. In view of the above situation, the meeting decided: (1) To improve the 勤务 organization and strengthen leadership, the 勤务 cadres of each district will be separated from the district headquarters. Those who are strong can become stationmasters at the transportation stations to directly control the 勤务 work. The rest will be concentrated in the county armed forces department for unified control and use, and people will be regularly sent to the countryside to help the stations with their work, and to go deep into the villages to understand the problems and study the 勤务 work. (2) To conduct a comprehensive and detailed survey of manpower and animal power to expand the burden area and reduce the burden on each household. (3) The county will uniformly print 代耕 certificates and issue them to households that should receive 代耕. Whoever does the 代耕 can be given a 代耕 certificate, and the work can be reported to the station with the certificate. (4) The stations should maintain close contact with each other and try to implement the 回脚 (huijiao, return trip) method, and the work should be recorded in the same way. (5) The families of militiamen going on expeditions will be helped with production by means of 拨工 (bogong, labor allocation) or 包耕 (baogeng, contracting for plowing), and 平工 齐工 will be implemented in the future.

　　纠正一切浪费民力现象
  　平西召开勤务会议
    【新华社晋察冀十四日电】北岳区平西分区最近召开整理群众勤务会议，纠正严重的浪费民力现象。目前该区勤务负担上存在以下问题：（一）各地负担很不平衡，如涞水等地勤务负担较其他县分都重，又因各村本位主义，未将实有人数与牲口向交通站报告，以致形成县、区、村和每一个人时轻时重现象。（二）非法动员相当严重，如干部接送家属，运送行李，甚至机关转运菜蔬都要动员勤务。据宛产西斋村去年不完整的统计，非法动员的数字占动员数达百分之十。（三）代耕的数字不确实，由于代耕是各村自己派工，月终报站，各村因本位主义，大部以少报多。（四）交通站的位置不适中，有的村离站五十多里，到站出工一次来回得三天，浪费时间相当严重。有的干部对平工、齐工制度掌握不好，使各村平衡负担上受到影响。根据以上情形，会议决定：（一）健全勤务组织加强领导，各区之勤务干事脱离区大队部，强的可到交通站当站长，直接撑握勤务工作，其余集中县武装部，统一掌握使用，经常派人下乡帮助各站工作，和深入各村了解问题，研究勤务工作。（二）普遍详密调查人力畜力，扩大负担面，以减轻各户负担额。（三）由县统一印制代耕证，发给应受代耕户，谁代耕即可给予代耕证一张，凭证到站报工。（四）站与站之间经常取得密切联系，尽量实行回脚办法，同样记工。（五）对出征民兵家属采用拨工或包耕办法，帮助生产，将来平工齐工。
