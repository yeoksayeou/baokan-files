　　Wayaotou Returns Wrongly Confiscated Property to Middle Peasants
　　Farmers' Production Enthusiasm Increases
[Gaoping News] Yuan Xiaogui of Wayaotou had nine rooms of varying sizes, 32 mu of land, a family of nine, and one ox. On the second day of the eighth lunar month last year, Gui Ze said something because he was unwilling to make too many military shoes: "I can only make one pair, I can't make two pairs." The next day, he was called to the farmers' association. He admitted his mistake and said, "Although I said that, I had already prepared the soles overnight." The village chief said, "Basic people can be forgiven for saying that, but you can't." Gui Ze said, "Am I a bandit or a traitor?" Yuan Dongwang, the vice chairman of the farmers' association, started hitting him. Jiu Ze (Gui Ze's son) saw it while he was hitting him, and shouted, "Are you not reasoning?" Five or six cadres said he was a special agent causing trouble and beat Jiu Ze severely. That night, a mass meeting was held, and the masses were asked to give their opinions, but no one dared to say anything. Then, the leaders called out and the subordinates answered (family members of village cadres, etc.) and beat the father and son again. Jiu Ze was detained in the Public Security Bureau, and all his family property was confiscated. After the meeting, the masses discussed one after another. Middle peasant Yuan Xiaojiu said, "It's not necessary to confiscate just because he said something wrong about making military shoes!" Middle peasant Yuan Sanhai said, "If you have something to eat, you eat; if you have something to wear, you wear; if you move around a little, it's just like a little Gui Ze." The women saw that Gui Ze had nothing to eat, and secretly gave him some food on the millstone (no one dared to go to his house). The wife of middle peasant Dingzi gave him two sheng of rice; the wife of poor peasant Renzi gave him one sheng of corn flour. They said, "Hurry up! If you are seen (referring to the cadres), you will be said to be harboring special agents." In December, poor peasants Yuan Maohai, Yuan Fulu, and others said to Gui Ze behind his back, "The Land Law Outline has been issued. Landlords and rich peasants still have a share. Can you not get a share?" In February of this year, poor peasant Gao Liugen said to Gui Ze, "Go to the county and find the county head." On the tenth of last month, a district cadre went to Gui Ze's house to understand the situation and listen to the opinions of the masses. On the fifteenth, a mass meeting was held to publicize the Land Law Outline, explaining that middle and poor peasants are one family, etc. Then, Gui Ze was asked to talk to the masses about the experience of being confiscated. Gui Ze first reviewed himself and proposed: I can't stand with the rich peasants, and I don't qualify as a poor peasant. I am a middle peasant. According to the Land Law Outline, the property should be returned to me, but what I say alone doesn't count. Let everyone evaluate. At this time, people spoke up one after another, and all unanimously believed that it should be resolutely returned. Finally, Gui Ze asked everyone: "If the land is returned, I still can't farm it if the child is detained." The masses unanimously agreed that the district cadres should be asked to ask the Public Security Bureau for people. When the Public Security Bureau initially detained him, they also felt that it was not right to detain him for making military shoes, but because there was a letter from the district cadre (then district cadre Lü Xuezeng), they had to accept it. This time, when he was released, the Public Security Bureau apologized to him and said: It was wrong to detain him carelessly without careful investigation at that time. After this problem was solved, the masses' production enthusiasm suddenly increased. Everyone said, "Let's move around well. We are not afraid of being struggled against again if we live by our own labor." Gui Ze drove the returned ox, delivering manure by the roadside. When people from Gou Village passed by, he told them, "Go back and tell my daughter-in-law's family that all my things have been returned." When he saw the villagers of Kangying, he asked someone to tell his relatives.

　　瓦窑头退还错斗中农财产
  　农民生产劲儿高
    【高平消息】瓦窑头袁小贵则家有大小房九间，地三十二亩，九口人，牛一头。去年八月初二日（阴历），贵则因不愿多做军鞋，说了些二话：“我只做一对，两对做不成”，第二天就被叫到农会，他认错说：“我虽那样说，但我连夜已把底垫起了。”村长说：“基本老百姓说了能原谅，你不行。”贵则说：“我是土匪、汉奸？”农会副主席袁东旺，动手就打。正打时被九则（贵则儿）见了，大叫：“不说理啦？”五、六个干部说他是特务捣乱，痛打九则。当晚召开群众大会，叫群众提意见，但群众谁也不敢吭气，于是上叫下答（村干家属等）又痛打父子俩一顿。九则扣到公安局，家产全部没收。散会后群众纷纷议论，中农袁小九说：“做军鞋说错了，也犯不着没收呀！”中农袁三孩说：“有吃吃了，有穿穿了，很动弹，亦不过落个小贵则。”妇女们见贵则没吃的，偷偷的在碾子上（任何人不敢到他家）给他些吃的。中农顶子媳妇，给他二升米；贫农任子媳妇给他一升玉茭面，她们说：“快走！见了（指干部）又说包庇特务。”腊月间，贫雇袁毛孩、袁福禄等背后向贵则说：“法大纲下来了，地主、富农还有一份，你还能不分一份。”今年二月间，贫雇高柳根向贵则说：“你去县里找县长去。”上月十号有区干到贵则家了解情况，听取群众反映，十五号召开群众大会，宣传土地法大纲，说明中贫农本是一家人等等，随即让贵则向群众谈谈被没收经过，贵则首先检讨自己，提出：我富农站不上，贫农不合格，我是个中农。根据法大纲，房产得退给我，但我一个人说不顶事，大家评评。此时群起发言，都一致认为应坚决退还。最后，贵则要求大家：“退回地，孩子被扣着还是种不了。”群众一致允许要区干部向公安局请示要人。公安局当初扣他时，也觉得为做军鞋不该扣，但因有区干（当时区干吕学曾）来信也只好收下。这次放回，公安局并向他道歉说：当时没认真调查，马虎扣押是不对的。这一问题解决后，群众生产情绪顿时提高，大家说：“好好动弹吧，自劳而活总不怕再斗了”。贵则赶着退回来的牛，在大路旁送粪，沟村人路过，他告说：“你们回去告我女婿家，说我东西都退回来了。”见康营村民，又托人转告他亲戚。
