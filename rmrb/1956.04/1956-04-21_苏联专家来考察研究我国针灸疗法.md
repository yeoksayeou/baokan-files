The Ministry of Health of China has accepted three Soviet female medical experts to come and investigate and study acupuncture therapy in China, starting from April 17th. They are Professor Dekotchenskaya from the Soviet Institute of Health Organizations and Medical History, Dr. Usova, a neurologist from the Moscow Central Institute for Advanced Training of Physicians, and Dr. Osipova, a neuro-physiotherapist.

The three experts were sent by the Soviet Ministry of Health in accordance with the resolutions of the Third Meeting of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation in 1955. The specific reception work is the responsibility of the Acupuncture Institute of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

The purpose of the three experts' visit is to strengthen academic exchanges between China and the Soviet Union, study and improve China's national medicine, and enrich modern medical science. Their research plan includes eleven topics such as "Understanding the use of acupuncture methods in various clinics and hospitals in China" and "Research on the theory and practice of acupuncture techniques and methods." At the same time, the experts will introduce to Chinese medical scientists the various principles currently used in the Soviet Union as the basis for reflex therapy and segmental reflex therapy, as well as the stimulation therapies used, and the theoretical concepts of the mechanism of reflexive physiotherapy currently recognized in the Soviet Union.

The experts' investigation and research work will continue for three months. In the first stage, Chinese acupuncture experts such as Zhu Lian will systematically introduce acupuncture therapy to the experts through lectures. In the later stage, the experts will participate in clinical treatment and other activities at the Acupuncture Institute of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

    苏联专家来考察研究我国针灸疗法
    我国卫生部从四月十七日起接受三位苏联医学女专家前来考察研究我国针灸疗法。她们是：苏联保健机构及医学史研究所的德柯琴斯卡娅教授，莫斯科中央医师进修学院的神经科医师乌索娃和神经——理疗科医师奥辛波娃。
    三位专家是根据1955年中苏科学技术合作第三届会议决议，由苏联保健部派来的。具体接待工作由中医研究院针灸研究所负责。
    三位专家这次来的目的，是为了加强中苏两国学术交流，研究提高中国的民族医学，以丰富充实现代医学科学。他们的考察研究计划，包括“了解中国各种门诊和医院治疗机构使用针灸方法的情况”、“针灸使用技术和方法方面的理论与实际的研究”等十一个专题。同时，专家们将向中国医学家们介绍目前苏联使用的作为反射疗法和分节反射疗法基础的各项原则以及所使用的刺激疗法，并介绍现在苏联所公认的反射性理疗作用机制的理论概念。
    专家们的考察研究工作将连续进行三个月。前一阶段，主要是通过讲课方式由我国针灸学家朱琏等向专家们系统地介绍针灸疗法。后一阶段，专家们将参加中医研究院针灸研究所的临床治疗等活动。
