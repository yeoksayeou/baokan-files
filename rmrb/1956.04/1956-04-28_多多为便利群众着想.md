After the cooperative transformation of service-oriented handicraft industries in Wuhan, blind centralization of operations once caused production chaos and aroused public dissatisfaction. Now, the Wuhan Municipal Handicraft Industry Bureau has corrected this deviation, enabling production to develop normally.

Wuhan's service-oriented handicraft industries include 14 sectors such as pastry and noodle making, shoe making, tailoring, washing and dyeing, bicycle repair, clock and watch repair, electrical and plumbing repair, sheet metal repair, itinerant copper smithing, pot mending, toothbrush repair, rubber product repair, and bamboo, wood, and rattan product repair, with a total of 11,000 employees. They are widely distributed, moving through streets and lanes, and closely connected with the masses. After these industries were fully cooperativized at the end of January this year, the Wuhan Municipal Handicraft Industry Bureau did not carefully study their characteristics and blindly merged and centralized them. At the same time, most production cooperatives implemented a unified management, centralized operation, and unified profit and loss accounting system.

Those who originally peddled and provided repair services through the streets and lanes were no longer willing to do so after centralization. Workers who used to collect and deliver laundry along the streets no longer collected or delivered. Copper smiths who used to repair keys for people in the streets and alleys were no longer willing to move around and wanted to switch to manufacturing. Some shoe-making production cooperatives implemented an eight-hour work system, and people often found them "off work" when they came to have their shoes soled or repaired. In the Wuchang district, the original 60 bicycle repair households were consolidated into two cooperatives with only 14 repair points, apart from six individual operations, after cooperativization. People found it difficult to find a place to repair their bicycles even after searching several streets.

Production became chaotic, and the income of cooperative members decreased. Some shoe-making cooperatives, after centralization, often made mistakes due to lack of management experience: often attaching one person's shoe upper to another person's sole. At the same time, because the customers changed, the members did not understand the new customers' preferences, and the shoes made were not satisfactory. The Second Shoe-Making Cooperative had to rework 150 pairs of shoes within half a month due to poor quality and mistakes. After centralization, these shoe-making cooperatives incurred expenses for staffing non-productive personnel, as well as increased rent, utilities, and shop front painting costs. Despite automatically increasing the price of resoling shoes by five to ten cents per pair, the daily income of cooperative members still decreased from the previous two to four yuan to sixty to ninety cents. In Wuchang district's pastry and noodle industry, the income of 133 out of 239 people decreased after centralization. In particular, the auxiliary labor of the original households could not be utilized, and the income of each household also decreased relatively, which dissatisfied the members. When members encountered difficulties and complained to the staff, the staff also felt very embarrassed.

After the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this chaotic phenomenon, it immediately instructed the Municipal Handicraft Industry Bureau to correct it. The Municipal Handicraft Industry Bureau first organized cadres to earnestly study the relevant instructions of the State Council and the Municipal Party Committee, criticized the thinking of some staff members who only considered management convenience and ignored the convenience of the masses, as well as the erroneous idea that organization necessarily required centralized production. Then, they relied on the masses to conduct a bottom-up survey by industry and proposed specific reorganization plans. During the reorganization process, they repeatedly propagated and explained to the members that centralized or decentralized production must meet certain conditions and must promote production development and facilitate residents' needs, thereby dispelling the concerns of a few members who were unwilling to decentralize production again. The reorganization work was carried out based on the principle of combining the development of production with meeting the needs of the people. In order to maintain and promote the specialties and advantages of the original business methods and production methods of service and repair industries, the single operating method of unified management, centralized operation, and unified accounting of profits and losses, which had been blindly unified, was changed to three operating methods: 1. Unified management, centralized or decentralized production (adding service points or sending members to provide mobile services), and unified accounting of profits and losses. For example, production cooperatives with slightly more complex processes and greater collaboration, such as clock and watch repair and bicycle repair, adopted this operating method. 2. Unified management, group production, and profit and loss accounting based on members' voluntary grouping or separate accounting of profits and losses. 3. Unified management, decentralized production, and separate accounting of profits and losses. Industries with simple processes, no fixed locations, and high mobility, such as itinerant copper smithing, water pipe repair, and rubber shoe repair, adopted this form.

After the Municipal Handicraft Industry Bureau took these measures, many production cooperatives restored their original service points and excellent service systems according to the needs of the masses. Jiang'an district restored 1,190 service points from the original 274 service points. Wuchang district restored 1,008 service points from the original 170 service points. Originally, there was not a single noodle shop on the more than two-mile-long road from Yongqing Street to Toudao Street, but now 19 have been added. Some people said with great satisfaction: "Originally, we had to take a bus to buy noodles, but now it's not too late to buy them after the water is boiled." Washing and dyeing production cooperatives restored the method of mobile service, sending members to the streets to collect and deliver clothes. When restoring service points, each cooperative also made appropriate adjustments to service points that were irrationally distributed in the past. Some members of shoe-making production cooperatives, after restoring decentralized production, found their old customers, and according to their old customers' preferences, they used their "foot-reading shoe making" skills to ensure product quality. In order to improve service quality, the Second Clock and Watch Repair and Parts Production Cooperative organized two mobile service teams to go deep into basic construction sites to repair clocks and watches for workers. The workers praised them: "It's really a cooperative, they really think things through."

The income of cooperative members has also increased. Li Tiancheng, a member of the pastry and noodle production cooperative, earned more than twice as much per month after decentralized production as he did under centralized production. After the Eighth Washing and Dyeing Cooperative restored the mobile service method, everyone's income increased by an average of 10% compared to the past. With increased income, the production enthusiasm of the members has generally increased. At present, service-oriented handicraft production cooperatives throughout the city are formulating service covenants and participating in labor competitions centered on good service.

    多多为便利群众着想
    张碨
    武汉市服务性手工业，在实行合作化以后，曾经因为盲目集中经营，使生产混乱，引起群众不满。现在，武汉市手工业管理局已经纠正了这个偏向，使生产正常发展。
    武汉市服务性手工业有糕面、绱鞋、成衣、洗染、自行车修理、钟表修理、水电修理、白铁修理、铜匠担子、补锅、牙刷修理、胶制品和竹木藤制品修理等十四个行业，从业人员共有一万一千人。他们分布面很广，流动串街，跟群众联系密切。今年一月底，这些行业全部合作化以后，武汉市手工业管理局没有很好研究他们的特点，便盲目地把他们合并和集中起来；同时，大多数生产合作社都实行了统一管理，集中经营，统一计算盈亏的办法。
    原来流动串街买卖和经营修理业务的，集中经营后不愿再串街了。过去洗染衣服的工人沿街收、送衣服，现在不收也不送了。流动在大街小巷为人们修理钥匙的铜匠，也不愿再流动串街，而要转向制造了。有些绱鞋生产社实行了八小时工作制，群众来绱鞋补鞋常常遇到他们“下班”。武昌区修理自行车的原有六十户，实行合作化后，除了六户个体经营外，其余的集中成二个合作社，只设十四个修理点。人们自行车坏了，跑好几条街还找不到修理的地方。
    生产混乱，社员收入减少了。有的绱鞋社集中经营以后，因为缺乏管理经验，经常出错：往往把这个人的鞋帮绱到另一个人的鞋底上。同时，因为主顾变了，社员不了解新主顾的爱好，绱的鞋也不能令人称心满意。第二绱鞋社半个月内因为质量不好和差错事故，就返工一百五十双鞋。这些绱鞋社在集中经营后，因为配备了脱离生产的工作人员，又增加了房租、水电费和粉刷门面等的开支，尽管他们曾自动把每双鞋子绱价涨了五分到一角，社员的每天收入仍然由过去的二元至四元，降低到六角至九角。武昌区糕面业239人，集中经营后有133人收入减少。特别是原有各户的辅助劳动力没能利用，每户的收入也相对减少，社员们都不满意。社员有了困难，找工作人员诉苦，工作人员也很是为难。
    中共武汉市委发现了这种混乱现象后，立即指示市手工业管理局纠正。市手工业管理局首先组织干部认真学习了国务院和市委的有关指示，批判了某些工作人员只为管理方便不管群众便利的思想，以及那种以为组织起来就必须集中生产的错误想法。然后，他们就依靠群众按行业摸底，提出了具体改组方案。在改组过程中，他们反复向社员宣传解释集中生产或分散生产必须具备一定的条件，都必须促进生产发展和便利居民需要，从而打消了少数社员不愿再分散生产等的思想顾虑。改组工作是根据发展生产同满足人民需要相结合的原则进行的。为了保持和发扬服务修理性行业原有经营方式和生产方式的专长和优点，把已经盲目统一管理、集中经营、统一计算盈亏的单一经营方式改为三种经营方式：一、统一管理、集中生产或分散生产（增设服务点或派社员流动服务），统一计算盈亏。例如钟表修理和自行车修理等工艺过程稍复杂，协作性较大的生产合作社即采取这种经营方式；二、统一管理、分组生产，根据社员自愿分组计算盈亏或各计盈亏；三、统一管理、分散生产、各计盈亏。如铜匠担子、修理水管、修理胶鞋等工艺过程简单、无固定场所、流动性大的行业，就采用了这种形式。
    市手工业管理局采取了这些措施后，许多生产合作社根据群众需要恢复了原有的服务点和优良的服务制度。江岸区把274个服务点恢复为1，190个点。武昌区把170个服务点恢复为1，008个点。原来，永清街到头道街二里多路没有一家轧面铺，现在增设了十九家。有的群众很满意地说：原来买面条要搭汽车，现在烧开了水再买也不迟了。洗染生产社恢复了流动服务的办法，派社员出去串街收衣、送衣。各个社在恢复服务点的时候，对过去分布不合理的服务点也作适当的调整。有些绱鞋生产社的社员，恢复了分散生产后，找到了老主顾，根据老主顾的喜好，发挥了“看脚绱鞋”的技巧，保证了产品质量。第二钟表修配生产合作社为了提高服务质量，组织了两个流动服务组深入基本建设工地为工人修理钟表。工人称赞他们：到底是合作社，想得真周到。
    社员的收入也有了增加。糕面生产社社员李天成分散生产后，每月收入比集中生产的多一倍以上，第八洗染社恢复了流动服务的办法后，每人的收入平均比过去增加10％。收入增加了，社员们的生产积极性普遍高涨。目前全市服务性手工业生产社正在制定服务公约，参加以服务良好为中心的劳动竞赛。
