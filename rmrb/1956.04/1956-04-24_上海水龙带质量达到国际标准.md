Shanghai Fire Hose Quality Reaches International Standards

The quality of fire hoses produced by various joint state-private fire hose factories in Shanghai has reached international standards.

In the past, these factories did not pay enough attention to product quality, and the burst pressure resistance of the fire hoses they produced was generally only around 300 pounds. After these factories became joint state-private enterprises, the Shanghai Second Reproduction Industrial Company helped them establish technical research groups to actively research and improve quality, so that the burst pressure resistance of the fire hoses all reached the international standard of 500 pounds or more. The fire hoses produced by the joint state-private Quanxin Factory even reached a burst pressure resistance of 580 pounds.

    上海水龙带质量达到国际标准
    上海市各公私合营水龙带厂生产的水龙带的质量，已经达到国际标准。
    过去，这些工厂对产品质量不够重视，制成的水龙带耐爆破压力一般只在三百磅左右。这些工厂实行公私合营以后，上海市第二复制工业公司帮助它们成立技术研究小组，积极研究改进质量，使水龙带的耐爆破压力都达到了国际标准规定的五百磅以上。公私合营全新厂出产的水龙带，耐爆破压力还达到了五百八十磅。
