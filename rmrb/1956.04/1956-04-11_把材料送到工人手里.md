    Getting Materials into the Hands of Workers
    The workload undertaken by the Harbin Construction Engineering Company this year has doubled compared to last year. The number of personnel in the Materials Section's Procurement and Supply Unit has decreased from forty-two last year to thirty-six. To do a good job in material supply, at the beginning of the year, the person in charge of the unit decided to adopt a "delivery system." That is, the company's Procurement and Supply Unit, the work area, and the work team jointly sign a material supply contact guarantee agreement. The work team makes a plan for the materials needed, specifying the type, specifications, and quantity, fifteen days in advance. After the work area reviews it, it is submitted to the company's Procurement and Supply Unit for unified procurement, and the materials are delivered to the workers on time.
    This approach has been warmly welcomed by the workers. Yan Shutian, leader of Work Team One in Work Area Three, said: "This method is great. Since work started on February 20th, there has never been a work stoppage due to material problems."
    Now, this company is preparing to fully implement this method. It is hoped that other construction units will also deliver all kinds of materials to the workers in a planned and timely manner.

    把材料送到工人手里
    哈尔滨市建筑工程公司今年承担的工程量比去年增加了一倍。材料科采运供应股的人员由去年的四十二人减至三十六人。为了做好材料供应工作，年初，股里的负责人决定采用“送料制”。即由公司采运供应股、工区和工段联合签订材料供应联系保证合同，工段把需用的材料按种类、规格和数量提前十五天作出计划，由工区审核后交公司采运供应股统一采购，按时把材料送到工人手里。
    这种作法得到了职工们的热烈欢迎。三工区一工段工长严树田说：“这种办法太好了，从二月二十日开工到现在，一次也没有因为材料问题停过工。”
    现在，这个公司准备全面推广这个办法。希望别的建筑单位，也像这样把各种材料，有计划地、及时地送到工人手里。
