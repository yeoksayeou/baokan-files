Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 11th: According to Vietnam News Agency, General Vo Nguyen Giap of the Vietnam People's Army wrote a letter on the 10th to G. Parthasarathi, Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam, concerning the joint responsibility of the French government and the South Vietnamese administration in implementing all of the Geneva Accords.

The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army recalled in the letter that since the implementation of the Geneva Accords entered the stage of resolving political issues, that is, the stage of realizing Vietnam's reunification through free general elections nationwide, some important provisions of the agreement have been frequently violated because France and the South Vietnamese administration have not fully implemented these agreements in accordance with their obligations, or have refused to implement these agreements.

The letter continued that although the French government and the General Command of the French Union Forces in Indochina are withdrawing French troops from South Vietnam, they have not even touched on the specific measures to be taken to ensure the continued fulfillment of their obligations in implementing the Geneva Accords. The South Vietnamese administration, which had systematically undermined the Geneva Accords in the past, is now taking advantage of the withdrawal of French troops to claim that it did not sign the Geneva Accords and therefore does not recognize the Geneva Accords.

This is another step in the conspiracy of the US-backed South Vietnamese administration to undermine the peace and unification of Vietnam, a conspiracy closely linked to the French government's attitude of evading its obligations to continue implementing the Geneva Accords. Therefore, the implementation of the Geneva Accords is increasingly threatened and urgently needs to be resolved.

Based on the position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army believes that although French troops will withdraw from South Vietnam, the French government's obligations to implement the Geneva Accords remain unchanged. As a signatory to these agreements, the French government must continue to implement them, ensure such continued implementation in every possible way, and guarantee the continued fulfillment of its obligations.

The South Vietnamese administration was legally represented by the French government during the Geneva negotiations and the signing of the agreements. Moreover, the South Vietnamese administration was one of the participants in the 1954 Geneva Conference. From a practical point of view and in terms of the actual situation, the South Vietnamese administration, together with the General Command of the French Union Forces, implemented many provisions of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities. Therefore, from a legal and practical point of view, the South Vietnamese administration clearly has the obligation to fully implement the Geneva Accords.

The South Vietnamese administration has already stated its attitude towards some political issues in its statement on April 6th, but since it categorically refuses to recognize the Geneva Accords, these are merely unilateral statements without any legal basis, and therefore cannot be considered to have any value in terms of continuing to implement the Geneva Accords in general or cooperating with the International Commission in particular.

For the above reasons, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army once again believes that the French government and the South Vietnamese administration have the joint responsibility to continue and ensure the continued full implementation of the Geneva Accords and to cooperate with the International Commission on the basis of these agreements. The French government and the South Vietnamese administration must bear full responsibility for the possible adverse consequences if they refuse to fully resolve the issue of implementing the Geneva Accords.

The letter said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that reconvening the Geneva Conference to discuss the obligations to continue implementing the Geneva Accords and the necessary guarantees has now become more urgent and indispensable than ever before.

Faced with the serious situation caused by the South Vietnamese administration's refusal to recognize the Geneva Accords and the French government's attitude of evading its obligations after the withdrawal of French troops, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army believes that the International Commission should promptly express its position and requests the Commission to:

One, state that although French troops are withdrawing from South Vietnam, the issue of ensuring the continued full implementation of the entire Geneva Accords is the joint responsibility of the French government and the South Vietnamese administration—the responsibility borne by the French government as a signatory to the Geneva Accords, and the responsibility of the South Vietnamese administration as the successor to the French government in continuing to implement these agreements;

Two, state that the above situation constitutes a major danger to the Geneva Accords and greatly hinders the activities of the International Commission, thereby seriously threatening peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia;

Three, report the above situation and the attitude taken by the International Commission in the face of such a situation to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, and request the two chairmen to take the necessary measures to ensure the full and correct implementation of the Geneva Accords.

### 越南人民军总司令部写信给国际委员会指出  法国和南越有责任全部履行日内瓦协议

    越南人民军总司令部写信给国际委员会指出
    法国和南越有责任全部履行日内瓦协议
    新华社河内11日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲十日写了一封信给越南国际监督和监察委员会主席格·帕塔萨拉蒂，谈到法国政府和南越行政当局执行全部日内瓦协议的共同责任问题。
    越南人民军总司令部在信中追述说，自从日内瓦协议的执行进入解决政治问题的阶段，也就是说，进入通过全国范围的自由普选实现越南的重新统一的阶段以来，由于法国和南越行政当局没有按照它们的义务充分地执行这些协议，或者说拒绝执行这些协议，以致协议的一些重要的条款经常遭到破坏。
    信中接着说，现在虽然法国政府和驻印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部在把法国军队从南越撤退，但是它们甚至没有触及为了保证继续履行它们在执行日内瓦协议方面的义务所要采取的具体措施。过去曾有计划地破坏日内瓦协议的南越行政当局，现在在利用法国军队撤退的机会，声称它并没有在日内瓦协议上签字，因此不承认日内瓦协议。
    这是受美国支持的南越行政当局的目的在于破坏越南的和平和统一的阴谋中的又一个步骤，这个阴谋是同法国政府所抱的规避继续执行日内瓦协议的义务的态度密切相连的。因此，日内瓦协议的执行日益受到威胁，迫切需要加以解决。
    越南人民军总司令部根据越南民主共和国政府的立场，认为：虽然法国军队将从南越撤退，但是法国政府承担的执行日内瓦协议的义务仍然没有改变。法国政府由于是这些协议的一个签字国，就必须继续执行它们，并且以一切可能的方法来保证这种继续执行，并且保证继续履行它的义务。
    南越行政当局在日内瓦谈判和协议签字期间在法律上是由法国政府代表的。况且，南越行政当局是1954年日内瓦会议的参加者之一。从实际的观点以及实际情况来看，南越行政当局同法兰西联邦部队总司令部一起执行了关于停止敌对行动的协议的许多条款。因此，从法律的和实际的观点来看，南越行政当局显然有充分执行日内瓦协议的义务。
    南越行政当局在它在四月六日的声明中已经表明了它对于一些政治问题的态度，可是由于它断然拒绝承认日内瓦协议，这只是一些没有任何法律根据的片面声明，因而不能被认为在总的说来继续执行日内瓦协议方面或具体说来同国际委员会的合作方面有任何价值。
    由于上述原因，越南人民军总司令部又一次认为，法国政府和南越行政当局有继续和保证继续充分执行日内瓦协议和在这些协议的基础上同国际委员会合作的共同职责。法国政府和南越行政当局必须对最后可能引起的不利后果负完全责任，如果它们拒绝充分地解决执行日内瓦协议的问题的话。
    信中说，越南民主共和国政府认为重新召开日内瓦会议以讨论继续执行日内瓦协议的义务和必要的保证措施问题现在已经变得比以前任何时候都更加迫切，更加不可缺少。
    面对着由于南越行政当局拒绝承认日内瓦协议和法国政府规避它在撤退法军之后的义务的态度所引起的严重局势，越南人民军总司令部认为国际委员会应当及时地表明态度，并且要求委员会：
    一、表明虽然法国军队撤离南越，但是保证整个日内瓦协议的继续充分地执行的问题是法国政府和南越行政当局的共同责任——法国政府作为日内瓦协议的一个签字国所承担的责任，同时南越行政当局作为法国政府的继承者在继续执行这些协议方面的责任；
    二、表明上述的局势构成了对日内瓦协议的重大危险，同时大大地阻碍了国际委员会的活动，从而严重地威胁了越南和东南亚的和平；
    三、向1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席报告上述局势和国际委员会在面临着这样一种局势的情况下所采取的态度，并且要求两位主席采取必要的措施来保证日内瓦协议的充分的和正确的执行。
