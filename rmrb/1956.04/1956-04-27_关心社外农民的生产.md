    Concern for the Production of Farmers Outside the Cooperative
    During the intense spring sowing period, in Jiaozhuang Township, Linyi County, Shandong Province, the land of forty-six households (twenty-eight poor peasant households and eighteen middle peasant households) of farmers outside the cooperative had not been properly plowed, and manure had not been fully delivered. The leaders of the agricultural production cooperatives in this township were unwilling to help when they saw this situation. They said that the farmers outside the cooperative were suffering the consequences of their own actions for not wanting to join the cooperative. After the township general branch committee discovered this problem, it held a meeting of party members, criticizing the erroneous thinking of some cooperative leaders in discriminating against farmers outside the cooperative. Then they convened a production meeting of farmers outside the cooperative, understanding the difficulties of these farmers outside the cooperative in spring sowing household by household. They helped some of the farmers outside the cooperative form six mutual aid teams. For some people who lacked labor and could not participate in mutual aid teams, the township general branch committee mobilized their relatives and neighbors to help them complete spring plowing and sowing, or the agricultural cooperative cultivated and sowed on their behalf. In this way, the difficult problems of all forty-six households of farmers outside the cooperative were resolved, and the farmers outside the cooperative were very grateful for this care and help. Some expressed that they would definitely join the cooperative after the autumn harvest.
    The practice of the Jiaozhuang Township General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in actively helping farmers outside the cooperative to solve their difficulties is worthy of study by grassroots rural workers in various places.

    关心社外农民的生产
    在紧张的春播期间，山东省临沂县蕉庄乡还有四十六户（贫农二十八户，中农十八户）社外农民的地没有耕好，粪没有送完。这个乡的农业生产合作社的领导人员看到这种情形也不愿帮助。他们说社外农民不愿入社是自作自受。乡总支委员会发现这个问题后，召开了党员会议，批判了某些合作社的领导人员歧视社外农民的错误思想。接着他们召开了社外农民生产会议，逐户了解了这些社外农民在春播中的困难。他们帮助一部分社外农民组成了六个互助组。对一些缺乏劳力不能参加互助组的人，乡总支委又动员他们的亲戚邻居帮助他们完成春耕播种，或者由农业合作社代耕代种。这样，四十六户社外农民的困难问题全部解决了，社外农民对这种关怀和帮助非常感激。有的表示秋后一定要入社。
    中共蕉庄乡总支委员会积极帮助社外农民解决困难问题的做法，值得各地农村基层工作人员学习。
