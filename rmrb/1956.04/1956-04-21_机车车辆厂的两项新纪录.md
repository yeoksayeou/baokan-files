Two New Records at Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant

    The state-owned Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant has set two new records in participating in the inter-factory competition among similar industries. The cylinder is the largest, most complex, and most labor-intensive component in the plant's foundry workshop. In the past, it took six workers to make one cylinder. Recently, on the 17th, this workshop made a cylinder with five workers, reaching the target set by the national inter-factory casting competition in the locomotive and rolling stock industry.
    The workers of the three-ton steam hammer group in the plant's forging workshop, when producing D-axles, used the Soviet method of accelerated rapid heating cycles for materials and learned the advanced experience of dividing the forging process into five steps. On April 14th, they set a new record of producing 119 D-axles per day, with all products meeting quality standards.

    机车车辆厂的两项新纪录
    国营青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂在参加同工种竞赛中创造了两项新纪录。汽缸是这个厂翻砂车间最大、最复杂、费工最多的一种活。过去，每做一个汽缸要用六个工。最近，这个车间在十七日用五个工做成一个汽缸，达到了全国机车车辆工业厂际铸工同工种竞赛所规定的指标。
    这个厂的锻冶车间三吨汽锤组工人，在生产D轴中的时候，运用了苏联加速快热循环烧料的方法，并且学习在锻造中分五道工序的先进经验，四月十四日创造了日产D轴119根的新纪录，产品质量也全部合乎规格。
