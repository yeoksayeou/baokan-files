    The socialist transformation we are undertaking truly deserves to be described with the word "great," and in this transformation, countless amazing things have happened. Whenever friends talk to me about this topic, I always like to tell them this story:

    January 15, 1956. Beijing at night.

    The sounds of gongs and drums were still reverberating in the streets and alleys, and the sounds and sparks of firecrackers swirled and glittered throughout the city and in the sky above.

    I passed through the bustling Dashilan area and turned onto an antique shop street. It was also vibrating with the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers. The shops on this famous art street were also all joint state-private enterprises.

    Through the long and short windows along the street, you could see antique calligraphy, paintings, porcelain, bronze tripods, and small bronze Buddhas behind the bright window glass. Figures moved about, all busy counting them.

    I walked to Zhengu Pavilion and pushed the door open. As the door closed behind me, it suddenly became quiet. I had entered a splendid and exquisite world. Around me were displayed so many, so beautiful ancient cultural relics.

    The capitalist of Zhengu Pavilion was named Qiu. He was very fat and now was sweating profusely from being so busy. This vice chairman of the Cultural Relics Industry Association, needless to say, had been extremely busy these past few days. The working group sent down by the city was discussing the inventory of assets with him.

    I waited for him a moment, browsing in front of the cabinets, illuminated by fluorescent lights. Several small porcelain bottles were very cute, imitations of the Ming dynasty. The Tang dynasty figurines of dancing girls beside them were even more simple and elegant. I also looked at some jade artifacts and a bronze axe placed on white satin. The latter had a tiger-shaped pattern, a cold color, and was covered with mottled bronze rust.

    At this time, the vice chairman came and led me to the inner room, where even more ancient cultural relics were displayed. We sat on a large couch facing south, with a table lamp in the middle of a small table. He poured me a bowl of tea. I told him my request for the interview: I hoped to know how their industrialists and businessmen were accepting socialist transformation. I don't know why, whether it was because he was too tired these past few days or for some other reason, he seemed a little nervous when he spoke to me. He spoke of the ten days that had recently shaken the world's attention: On January 5th, the cultural relics industry decided to be led by the Special Arts and Crafts Company. On the 8th, the entire industry submitted an application. On the 10th, it was approved, and then he was busy with the inventory work. By tonight, everything could be completed.

    By the time he finished telling all of this, the night was already deep. Beijing seemed to be gradually quieting down. I did not expect that when I asked him about the future arrangement of the commercial network, he would be so interested. Naturally, this street would be preserved as an antique street. In addition, he said, Langfang Second Alley, Zhushikou, Xinqiao Hotel, Wangfujing, Dong'an Market, Dengshikou, Dongsi, Donghuamen, Di'anmen, Xidan, Xuannei, and the western suburbs would all have antique shops. Look, it was as if the entire city of Beijing was unfolding before the vice chairman. Although the commercial network had not yet been finalized, they already had a comprehensive plan. The future, in his mind, seemed optimistic and beautiful.

    The more he spoke, the happier he became, and he became unrestrained. He believed the cultural relics industry had a great future. When the people become rich, "who wouldn't put something in their house?" He even said that agricultural production cooperatives would also come to buy ancient cultural relics and calligraphy and paintings in the future!

    At this point, the people from the working group came again. All the inventory work was almost complete, except for a few items that he, the vice chairman himself, had not yet resolved. Vice Chairman Qiu paused at this moment, looking somewhat uneasy. He excused himself, saying that he still had to talk to me, scratched his head, said he would talk to them later, and sent them away.

    I asked him, "I heard you have an extremely valuable item that you are going to take out as additional capital this time?"

    "Yes! Would you like to take a look?" He slowly took out a key from his pocket and opened a large cabinet. He took out a silk package and returned to the couch, opening it on the small table. Inside, a scroll was revealed. He pointed out the small paper strip on the scroll to me, which read five characters:

    Su Dongpo's Genuine Work

    "Look," he said, pulling open the scroll with one hand. "This is the item you're talking about."

    After a large section of blank paper, the inscription of a Song dynasty person first appeared, followed by a preface by a Yuan dynasty person praising this genuine work. Then, there was a short essay written by Emperor Qianlong of the Qing dynasty, personally examining and appreciating this genuine work. After that, a large pile of vermilion seals appeared. He pointed out to me that these seals were from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, emperors, artists, connoisseurs, and collectors.

    Finally, Su Dongpo's genuine work appeared. All of the characters were only about an inch in size, each one vigorous and powerful, yet charming and moving. The ink color was rich and light, very lovely, and the brushstrokes were extremely clear and elegant. In short, seeing such a treasure would make anyone feel infinitely happy. It was indescribable; the writing of this great Song dynasty poet was truly too good!

    "Look, this is Song dynasty paper and Song dynasty ink," Vice Chairman Qiu said, "I bought it for forty taels of gold before liberation." As he spoke, he continued to unroll the scroll. The portion of the genuine work was rolled past, and another large pile of seals appeared, followed by postscripts.

    "Look, Wen Zhengming and Ni Yunlin's postscripts."

    More postscripts appeared on the scroll. It was indeed an extremely valuable item.

    "I bought it for forty taels of gold," he repeated once more: "That year, someone offered me one hundred taels of gold, and I still thought it was too little and didn't sell it."

    A thought arose in my mind: It seemed that he was still a little reluctant to part with this treasure, and although he had to hand it over, he was unwilling in his heart.

    At this time, another burst of gongs, drums, and firecrackers came from outside the window. It was so late, yet Beijing was still celebrating and reveling.

    "According to the policy," I said, "you don't have to take it out!"

    "Taking it out is a certainty," he said, his tone very definite.

    "Then how much do you plan to value it at?"

    "This kind of thing, um, doesn't have a fixed price," he replied.

    At this time, three comrades from the working group came in.

    "Vice Chairman," one of the comrades said, seeing the genuine work on the small table, "let's quickly resolve this issue." He looked at his watch and said to Vice Chairman Qiu, "We only have two and a half hours left, and we all have to go to a meeting."

    "Okay," Vice Chairman Qiu said, returning to the couch, wringing his hands anxiously for a long time, and finally said something that surprised everyone: it turned out that this painting was not a genuine work, but a traced copy.

    He suddenly stood up, took the Su Dongpo genuine work in his hand, shook it, and said:

    "Traced copies can sometimes fool all collectors, connoisseurs, and artists. But despite this, a fake is still a fake, with loopholes. This Su Dongpo genuine work once fooled people like Wen Zhengming, Ni Yunlin, and Qianlong, and also fooled me. But on the very night I bought it back for forty taels of gold, I looked at it carefully and saw that it was a traced copy. But I was ruthless, and I still wouldn't sell it for one hundred taels. I thought I might as well gamble. Six years have passed since liberation, and I have been hiding it all along. But today, I can no longer deceive. I can no longer use it to extort from our such a good country. Since the entire industry became jointly operated, I have seen that my future is bright, but for these past few days, I have been hesitating in my heart. I thought I shouldn't hide it, but then I thought, why let people know it's fake? If I hide it, I'm afraid the experts from the Ministry of Culture will see through it too. You think I'm reluctant to part with this item, no, the problem is not here at all, the problem is whether I should say it's a fake or not... Now, please help me think about it, how much should I report this fake for?"

    At this time, in addition to the comrades from the working group, two employees from Zhengu Pavilion and a manager from Tonggu Hall came to this inner room, and all heard everything. We all opened our mouths, astonished.

    Vice Chairman Qiu seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, looked at everyone, and continued: "Okay, now that I've said it, I feel at ease."

    One of the comrades chuckled softly—I later learned that he was a cultural worker—and spoke:

    "This is completely unexpected," he said. "However, you keep saying 'fake,' 'fake.' This old way of speaking is not right. You should say that this is a copy of Su Dongpo's genuine work. The genuine work has already been lost, so this copy is also a very valuable item, just like Gu Kaizhi's 'Nymph of the Luo River Scroll,' which is now passed down through three copies. There is no doubt that this is a Song dynasty copy, and it still has artistic value and is also part of our cultural heritage..."

    Before he could finish speaking, many more people crowded into the room. The asset inventory work in the same industry had been a great success, and many shock brigade members and working group members came to Zhengu Pavilion to report their work to the vice chairman. The outer door opened and closed again and again, and the sound of gongs and drums poured in again and again. Vice Chairman Qiu listened to each report, making notes in a small notebook, and now he looked calm and composed, with no trace of unnaturalness on his face.

    I bid farewell and went out, returning to the street, and was submerged in the symphony of joy. This night, Beijing was reveling all night long.

    真迹
    徐迟
    我们的社会主义改造事业真是够得上用“伟大”这样的字眼来形容，在这场变革中，不知有多少令人惊异的事发生。每当朋友同我谈起这个话题来的时候，我总爱告诉他这样一个故事：
    1956年1月15日。北京的夜晚。
    一面面的锣、一张张的鼓，还在街道和胡同里震响着，响声和爆竹的火星一起，缭绕、闪耀在全城和上空。
    我穿过了繁华的大栅栏一带，转到了一条古玩铺街。它也震荡在锣鼓声和爆竹声中。这条驰名的艺术之街上的商店也到处是公私合营了的商店。
    透过那些沿街长短窗，你可以从明亮的窗玻璃后面看到古色古香的字画、瓷器、铜鼎和小铜佛等等。人影跳动，都在忙着清点它们呢。
    我走到珍古阁，推门进去。门在身后一掩上，顿时清净。我已步入一个灿烂而精美的世界。在我的周围，陈列着那末多，那末美的古文物。
    珍古阁的资本家姓裘。他长得很胖，现在正忙得满头大汗。这位文物业同业公会的副主任委员，不用说，这几天是忙极了。市里派下来的工作组正和他讨论清产核资。
    我稍等他一下；借着日光管的光芒，在一个个柜子前浏览。有几个小瓷瓶非常可爱，是仿明的。旁边几个唐俑的舞女更加古朴。我又看了几件玉器和一把放在白缎子上的铜斧。后者有虎形图案，色泽寒冷，布满斑烂的铜绿。
    这时，副主委来了，带我到了里屋，那儿陈列的古文物更多。我们坐在朝南的大榻上，小几中间放着一盏台灯。他给我斟了一碗茶。我就把访问他的要求说了：我希望能知道他们工商业者如何接受社会主义改造。不知为什么，是这几天忙得太累了还是别的什么原因，他在同我说话的时候，似乎总是有点紧张。他讲了最近这震撼世界视听的十日经过：一月五日，文物业决定受特种工艺公司的领导。八日，全行业提出了申请。十日，被批准，以后就忙于清点工作。这到今天晚上，全部可以完成。
    等他把这一切讲完，夜已经深沉了。北京市似乎渐渐安静了下来。我倒没有想到，当我问到他今后商业网的安排的时候，他的兴味会这么大。自然，这条街将被保存为一条文物街。此外呢，他说，廊坊二条、珠市口、新侨饭店、王府井、东安市场、灯市口、东四、东华门、地安门、西单、宣内、西郊，都要设古玩铺。看啊，仿佛整个北京市展开在这副主委面前了。虽然商业网还没有确定下来，不过他们已经有了一套全面规划。未来在他的心目中，显得乐观而且美好。
    他越说越高兴，就毫不拘束了。他认为文物业大有前途。人民富裕了，“谁不屋里摆摆？”他甚至于说，农业生产合作社将来也会来买古文物和字画的呢！
    说到这里，工作组的人又来了。一切清点工作差不多都完成了，就是他，副主委自己，有几件东西，还没有解决。裘副主委这时候停顿了一下，神色有些不安。他推说还要和我谈话，搔搔头皮，说一会儿再和他们谈，把他们送走了。
    我问他：“听说你有一件极宝贵的东西，这回拿出来作为增资了？”
    “是呀！你要看一看吗？”他慢慢地从身上掏出钥匙，去打开一个大柜子。他拿出一个绸包回到榻上，把它在小几上打开。里面显出一个卷轴。他的手指把卷轴上的小纸条给我指出，上面写着五个字：
    苏东坡真迹
    “你看，”他说着，一手拉开了卷轴。“你说的就是这件东西。”
    在拉过了一大段空白纸的后面，首先出现了一位宋人的题字，接着是一篇一位元人歌颂这件真迹的序言。然后，是清乾隆皇帝亲笔写的一篇考证和赞赏这件真迹的短文。之后，出现了一大堆朱红的图章。他给我指出，这些图章是宋、元、明、清的，什么皇帝，什么艺术家，鉴赏家和收藏家的。
    最后，苏东坡的真迹出现了。全是一方寸大小的字体，一个个雄健有力，而又妩媚动人。墨色浓淡都非常可爱，笔锋更是清逸之极。总之，看见这样的珍品，谁都会感到无限愉快的。这是形容不了的，这宋代大诗人写的字真是太好了！
    “你看，这是宋纸，宋墨”，裘副主委说，“解放前，我花了四十两黄金买下的。”一边说，他一边继续展开那卷轴。真迹的部分卷过去了，又出现一大堆图章，然后是跋文。
    “你看，文徵明，倪云林的题跋”。
    卷轴上出现了更多的题跋。确是一件亟珍贵的东西。
    “我四十两黄金买的”，他又重复了一次：“那年有人出一百两黄金给我，我还嫌少不卖。”
    我心里产生了一个念头：看样子，他好像还有点舍不得这件宝贝，又要把东西交出去，心里却又不肯交。
    这时窗外又传来一阵锣鼓、爆竹声。这样夜深了，北京市还在庆祝着，狂欢着呢。
    “按照政策”，我说：“你不把它拿出来也可以啊！”
    “拿出来是一定的了。”他说，口气倒非常肯定。
    “那你打算折多少价？”
    “这种东西，唔，没有一定价格。”他回答。
    这时，工作组的三个同志进来了。
    “副主委”，其中一个同志，看到小几上的真迹了，说：“我们赶快把这问题解决了吧。”他看了看手表，又向裘副主委说：“只有两个半小时了，我们都要去开会的。”
    “好。”裘副主委说，回到榻上，不安静地搓了半天手，终于说出了使大家吃惊的话：原来这幅画并不是真迹，是勾填的。
    他突然站起来，把那件苏东坡真迹拿到手上，摇摇它，说道：
    “勾填的东西，有时就能骗过所有收藏家，鉴赏家和艺术家。但尽管这样，假的终还是假的，有漏洞的。这件苏东坡真迹曾经骗过了文徵明，倪云林和乾隆那样的人，也骗了我。可是就在我用四十两黄金买回来的当天晚上，我细看了一下就看出它是勾填的。可是我狠心，一百两我还不卖。我想索性赌一赌。打解放到现在，已经六年了，我也还是一直隐瞒着。但是，今天我不能再欺骗了。我不能再拿它来向我们这样好的国家讹诈了。自从全行业合营以来，我已经看清我的前途光明，可是一连这几天，我心里一直在嘀咕，我想不隐瞒吧，但是又想，何必让人知道它是假的呢，隐瞒吧，又怕文化部的专家们也把它看出来。你们以为我舍不得这件东西，不，问题根本不在这里，问题在我说不说出来它是假货，……现在，请你们帮我想一想看，这个假货，我到底自报多少呢？”
    这时候，除了工作组的同志，还有珍古阁两个职工，另外还有通古堂的一位经理，都来到这里屋，都听到了这一切。我们都张开了嘴，惊奇万分。
    裘副主委好像松了一口气，看了大家一眼，又往下说：“好了，我说了出来，就安心了。”
    有一位同志轻轻一笑——后来我才知道他是一位文化工作者，他说话了：
    “这倒是完全没有想到的。”他说：“不过，你口口声声假货假货。这种旧的说法是不对的。应该说这是一件苏东坡真迹的临摹本。真迹已经找不到了，因此，这临摹本也是很宝贵的东西，就好像顾恺之的‘洛神赋图卷’，现在就从三个临摹本传世一样。这没有问题是宋人的临摹本，依然有艺术价值，也是我国文物遗产之一……”
    他的话还没有说完，又有许多人拥进屋来。同行业的清产核资工作已大功告成，许多突击队员和工作组员都到珍古阁来，要向副主委汇报工作。外边的门一开又一开，锣鼓声一次又一次的涌进来。裘副主委一个个听汇报，手在小本子上作纪录，现在他神色自若，脸上已一点也没有不自然的神情了。
    我告辞而出，回到街道上，又掩没在欢乐交响乐中，这一夜，北京市是彻夜狂欢的。
