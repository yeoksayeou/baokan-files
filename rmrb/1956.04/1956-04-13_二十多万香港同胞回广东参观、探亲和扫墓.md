Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 12th: Since mid-February this year, more than 200,000 compatriots from Hong Kong have returned to various parts of Guangdong for sightseeing, visiting relatives, and tomb sweeping.

Many Hong Kong compatriots are returning to Guangdong for the first time since liberation. They were very excited to see the development of industrial and agricultural production in the motherland, the stability of the people's lives, the good social atmosphere, and the diligent and humble responsible cadres of the government. Guan Shaoda, chairman of the Hong Kong Ginseng, Velvet and Medicine Merchants Association, said that after ten years of separation, his hometown has changed. A socialist upsurge is emerging everywhere, and the old, weak, women, and children are treated with courtesy and consideration everywhere. The order of the city is good, the land and fields have been developed and utilized, the efficiency of production and construction is very high, and the atmosphere of corruption has been swept away.

    二十多万香港同胞
    回广东参观、探亲和扫墓
    据新华社香港12日电　从今年二月中旬以来，香港有二十万以上的同胞回到广东各地参观、探亲和扫墓。
    有许多香港同胞都是解放后第一次回到广东参观。他们看到祖国工农业生产的发展，人民生活的安定，社会风气的良好和政府负责干部的勤恳谦虚，都感到非常兴奋。香港参茸药材行商会理事长关少达说，一别十年，故乡有了变化，社会主义高潮到处涌现，老弱妇孺处处受到优待礼让，城市秩序良好，土地田野都得到开辟利用，生产和建设效率都非常高，贪污风气已一扫而空。
