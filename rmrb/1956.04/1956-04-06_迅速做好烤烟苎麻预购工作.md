Quickly Do a Good Job of Pre-Purchasing Flue-Cured Tobacco and Ramie
    Yang Yinglu
    In order to encourage farmers to actively increase the production of flue-cured tobacco and ramie according to national plans, and to help farmers solve difficulties in production, the State Council has decided to pre-purchase flue-cured tobacco and ramie starting in 1956. The Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement has formulated specific pre-purchase measures and requires all localities to implement them.

    It is the first time to comprehensively carry out the pre-purchase of flue-cured tobacco and ramie nationwide. Because the agricultural product procurement departments have just been established, the organizations at all levels are not sound enough, and the procurement experience is very lacking, and the sowing time of flue-cured tobacco and ramie is approaching or has already arrived. Therefore, seizing the time and organizing forces to do a good job in pre-purchasing flue-cured tobacco and ramie is one of the main tasks of the agricultural product procurement departments at present. However, some regions do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance and arduousness of pre-purchase work, and pre-purchase work has not yet started. The agricultural product procurement agencies in a few regions have not yet been established, and some regions have established agencies, but have not yet taken over the tobacco and ramie procurement business. Obviously, if this situation is not changed quickly, the pre-purchase of flue-cured tobacco and ramie cannot be carried out.

    Flue-cured tobacco and ramie are important raw materials for light industry and important export materials. At present, China's production of flue-cured tobacco and ramie is far from meeting the needs of the country. Taking pre-purchase measures is precisely to help and promote farmers to actively increase the production of these two crops. Therefore, the agricultural product procurement units in various localities must immediately launch pre-purchase work in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the pre-purchase policy and pre-purchase measures. Regions that have not yet established procurement agencies should establish them quickly to carry out pre-purchase work; those that have established agencies but have not yet taken over the tobacco and ramie procurement business should take over as soon as possible, and allocate a certain amount of manpower to carry out pre-purchase work in a timely manner, so that the handover and pre-purchase work will not be delayed.

    The agricultural product procurement units in various localities should conduct in-depth publicity work among farmers so that farmers can fully understand the benefits of pre-purchasing flue-cured tobacco and ramie for the country and themselves, and then sign pre-purchase contracts on a voluntary basis. The signing of pre-purchase contracts and the issuance of deposits must be completed before sowing, so that the pre-purchase work can truly play a role in encouraging farmers to increase the production of flue-cured tobacco and ramie.

    After the pre-purchase contract is signed, the agricultural department should strengthen the technical guidance for farmers' production, help farmers overcome difficulties in production, and do a good job in seedling cultivation, sowing, tuft division, transplanting, and fertilization. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives should do a good job in supplying means of production and means of livelihood, and reasonably supply farmers with commercial fertilizers according to the amount of pre-sales and actual needs.

    迅速做好烤烟苎麻预购工作
    杨映录
    为了鼓励农民按照国家计划积极增产烤烟和苎麻，并帮助农民解决生产中的困难问题，国务院决定从1956年开始对烤烟和苎麻进行预购。农产品采购部已经制定了预购的具体办法，要求各地贯彻执行。
    在全国范围内全面开展烤烟和苎麻的预购工作，这还是第一次。由于农产品采购部门刚刚建立，各级机构还不够健全，采购经验也很缺乏，而烤烟和苎麻的播种时间又即将到来或已经到来，因此，抓紧时间、组织力量做好预购烤烟和苎麻工作，是当前农产品采购部门的主要任务之一。但是有的地区对预购工作的重要性和艰巨性认识不足，直到现在预购工作还没有着手进行。少数地区的农产品采购机构尚未建立，有的地区虽然已经建立机构，但是还没有把烟、麻采购业务接收过来。显然，如果不迅速改变这种情况，烤烟和苎麻的预购工作是无法开展的。
    烤烟和苎麻是轻工业的重要原料，又是重要的出口物资，目前，我国的烤烟和苎麻生产远远不能适应国家的需要。采取预购措施，正是为了帮助和推动农民积极地增产这两种作物。因此，各地农产品采购单位必须立即根据预购政策和预购办法，有计划有步骤地展开预购工作。现在还没有建立采购机构的地区，应当赶快建立，开展预购工作；已经建立机构但是还没有接管烟、麻采购业务的，应当从速接收，并且抽出一定力量及时进行预购工作，做到交接和预购工作两不误。
    各地农产品采购单位应该向农民进行深入的宣传工作，使农民充分认识预购烤烟和苎麻对于国家和自己的好处，然后在自愿的基础上订好预购合同。预购合同的签订和定金的发放必需在播种以前完成，才能使预购工作真正起到鼓励农民增产烤烟和苎麻的作用。
    在预购合同签定后，农业部门应该加强对农民的生产技术指导，帮助农民克服生产中的困难，做好育苗、播种、分蔸、移植、施肥等工作。国营商业部门和供销合作社要做好生产资料和生活资料的供应工作，根据预售数量和实际需要合理地供给农民商品肥料。
