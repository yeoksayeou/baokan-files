    Studying and Improving Rice Transplanters
    At the national rice transplanter trial symposium held in Wuchang, agricultural scientists, agricultural machinery experts from seventeen provinces and cities in rice-growing areas, and the creators and inventors of seventeen rice transplanters gathered to discuss and evaluate more than twenty rice transplanter samples, models, and drawings.
    Three rice transplanters with different structures created by the East China and Central China Agricultural Science Institutes and the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory have all achieved preliminary success in field trials, capable of automatically delivering seedlings, separating seedlings, and transplanting them. However, they also have shortcomings to varying degrees, such as relatively high seedling damage rates, uneven seedling separation, and inconsistent planting depths. The meeting decided to establish a rice transplanter central research group at the East China Agricultural Science Institute, using the existing three transplanters as a basis for collective research and improvement, striving to create a more perfect rice transplanter in a very short period of time.

    Building a Cement Plant in Kunming
    The first phase of construction of the new Kunming Cement Plant, the largest cement plant in Southwest China, has officially begun. This cement plant covers an area of 160,000 square meters and will have an annual production capacity of 300,000 tons of high-grade cement after completion. The complete set of equipment for this plant comes from the German Democratic Republic, and more than 400 tons of machinery have already been transported to the construction site.

    Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory Starts Full Trial Production
    On the morning of April 23, fifty-seven young female assemblers wearing white overalls entered the assembly workshop of the Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory to carry out the final process of the factory – assembling and adjusting the instruments. Thus far, this brand-new factory has been basically completed and has fully started trial production.
    This factory basically installed its equipment in early April and began trial-manufacturing parts for the first batch of switchboard instruments and automobile instruments. Workers in the bakelite workshop successfully trial-produced bakelite meter housings on hydraulic presses on April 20. Workers in the foundry workshop pressure-cast high-quality meter frame parts on new die-casting machines every three minutes on April 21. Workers in the machining, stamping, and other workshops also increased the efficiency of manufacturing parts in a short period of time. Now, the first batch of more than one hundred kinds of instrument parts have been put into storage or are being electroplated. Soon, the first batch of switchboard instruments can be trial-produced.

    The First Large-Scale Radio Transmitter Performs Well
    A 60-kilowatt radio transmitter is currently being used to broadcast international news. This is the first large-scale radio transmitter manufactured by the Shanghai Equipment Factory of the Equipment Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. This machine is very powerful and can provide reception for distant places. The design of the entire machine, as well as many major parts and accessories, are made in China. When the machine was completed and assessed, all technical indicators met the requirements. After use, the performance is generally good.
    The three-channel carrier equipment, which is widely used in long-distance telephone calls, has also basically been successfully trial-produced recently. Installing this machine on long-distance telephone switchboards allows four parties to talk simultaneously on a pair of copper wires, giving a pair of copper wires the function of four pairs of copper wires. Moreover, when making long-distance calls, installing the amplifier, which is one of the components of this machine, allows people to hear each other clearly even at a very long distance. In the past, the carrier equipment used on China's long-distance telephone lines was all purchased from abroad. In the future, not only can domestically produced three-channel carrier equipment be used in large quantities, but technicians and workers are already starting to study twelve-channel carrier equipment.

    Anshan Iron and Steel Supplies Large Quantities of Steel to Various Regions
    From the beginning of this year to mid-April, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company supplied more than 46% more various types of steel to the whole country compared to the same period last year. These steels include medium plates, channel steel, heavy rails, and seamless steel pipes of different specifications. Among them, there are more than fifty new products that China could not manufacture in the past, such as heavy crane rails needed by tractor factories. These steels are supplied to more than one thousand production units and capital construction units across the country, including the Baotou Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and other key construction projects.

    A Good Way to Green the Desert
    Farmers in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province, near the desert areas, are taking measures to promote the natural propagation of tamarisk by flooding the desert to green the desert. According to the head of the Zhangye Prefecture Forestry Bureau, using this method, large areas of desert in the Hexi Corridor can be completely greened in six or seven years.
    Tamarisk is a shrub that is extremely suitable for growing in the desert. It has many seeds, which are scattered everywhere by the wind. Flooding the desert with water causes tamarisk to grow in clusters wherever there are seeds, and they can grow to be three or four feet tall in the same year. This method was successfully tested by farmers in Jinta County last year. This year, the Zhangye Prefecture Forestry Bureau summarized this experience and promoted it to various places.

    为提早完成五年计划而奋斗
    研究改进水稻插秧机
    在武昌举行的全国水稻插秧机试验座谈会上，水稻地区十七个省、市的农业科学家、农业机械专家和十七个水稻插秧机的创造者、发明者，一起讨论和鉴定了二十多种水稻插秧机的样品、模型和图纸。
    华东、华中两个农业科学研究所和湖南省农业机械厂创造的三部结构不同的水稻插秧机，经过实地试验都获得初步成功，能自动送秧、分秧和插秧。但是，也各有不同程度的缺点，如秧苗损伤率比较高、分秧不够均匀，插得深浅不一等。会议决定，在华东农业科学研究所成立水稻插秧机中心研究组，以现在的三部插秧机为基础，集体研究改进，争取在很短的时期内，创造出一部比较完善的水稻插秧机。

    在昆明建设水泥厂
    西南最大的水泥厂——新建昆明水泥厂的第一期建厂工程已正式开工。这个水泥厂占地面积共有十六万平方公尺，建成后每年生产高标水泥可达三十万吨。这个厂的成套设备来自民主德国，现在已有四百多吨重的机器运到工地。（云南日报编辑部）
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂全面试生产
    四月二十三日早晨，五十七个穿着白色罩衣的年青女装配工走进哈尔滨电表仪器厂的装配车间，进行工厂最后一道工序——装配仪表的调整生产。至此，这座崭新的工厂基本建成，全面开始试生产。
    这座工厂在四月初就基本上安装好设备，并且开始试制第一批开关板仪表和汽车仪表的零件。胶木车间的工人，四月二十日在水压机上试制成功了胶木表壳。铸工车间工人四月二十一日在新式的压铸机上，每三分钟就压铸出一个质量好的表架零件。机械、冲压等车间的工人们也在短短的期间提高了制造零件的效率。现在，第一批一百多种仪表零件已经入库或者正在电镀。不久，第一批开关板仪表就可以试制出来。    （新华社）
    第一架大型无线电发讯机效能良好
    一架六十瓩的无线电发讯机，目前正在用来对国际广播新闻。这是邮电部器材供应管理局上海器材厂制造的第一架大型无线电发讯机。这种机器电力很强，能供给很远的地方收听。整个机器的设计以及不少主要零件、配件都是我国自制的。这部机器在完工鉴定的时候，各项技术指标都达到了要求。使用以后，效能一般良好。
    在长途电话中应用得很广的三路载波机最近也基本上试制成功了。在长途电话的交换机上装上这种机器，就可以在一对铜线上由四个对方同时通话，使一对铜线起了四对铜线的作用。而且在远距离通话的时候，装上这个机器的组成部分之一的增音机，在很远的地方也能听清对方讲话。过去中国长途电话线路上使用的这种载波机都是从国外买来的。今后不但可以大量采用国产品的三路载波机，而且技术人员和工人们已经在着手研究十二路载波机了。

    鞍钢供应各地大批钢材
    鞍山钢铁公司从今年初到四月中旬供应全国的各种钢材，比去年同时期增加了46％以上。这些钢材包括不同规格的中板、槽钢、重轨和无缝钢管等。其中有五十多种是我国过去不能制造的新产品，像拖拉机制造厂需要的重型吊车轨道等。这些钢材供应全国一千多个生产单位和基本建设单位，其中包括包头钢铁联合企业、第一汽车制造厂和武汉长江大桥等重点建设工程。（辽宁日报编辑部）
    绿化沙漠的好办法
    甘肃省河西走廊靠近沙漠地带的农民，正在采取漫灌沙漠促进柽柳天然繁殖的办法来绿化沙漠。据张掖专区林业局负责人谈，采用这种办法，河西走廊地区的大片沙漠在六、七年内就可全部绿化。
    柽柳是极宜于在沙漠中生长的一种灌木，籽多，经风吹动便散布到各处。引水漫灌沙漠，有籽的地方就长出一丛一丛的柽柳，当年就可以长到三、四尺高。这个办法是金塔县农民去年试验成功的，今年张掖专区林业局总结了这个经验，向各地推广。
