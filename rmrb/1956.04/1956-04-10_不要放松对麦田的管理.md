    Do Not Relax Management of Wheat Fields
    Wang Zhimin
    Since the beginning of spring, management of wheat fields in various regions has been strengthened compared to previous years. The irrigated area of wheat fields has generally expanded, and the general amount of fertilizer applied has also increased compared to previous years. However, at present, wheat mites, wheat aphids, armyworms, and other pests have been found in some areas of Hubei, Guangxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. According to inspections, in Yongqing District, Shangnan County, Shaanxi Province, each wheat seedling clump has twenty wheat mites, with severe cases having more than 150; in Wanpian Township, Xiangyang County, Hubei, 658 mu of wheat have died due to aphid damage; in Xiqiao District, Mengshan County, Guangxi, the wheat leaves in some fields have been eaten bare by armyworms. Although some regions have had spring rain, the amount of rainfall is still considered insufficient. For example, since the beginning of spring, rainfall in Shaanxi Province is two-thirds less than the same period last year. Furthermore, based on the pattern of frost occurrence in recent years, there are often varying degrees of frost damage in April, which poses a great threat to wheat production. Some regions have already experienced frost damage this year. These situations indicate that, in order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest, all regions must do a good job in managing wheat fields in the following aspects:

    First, promptly prevent and control wheat pests. Regions that have already found wheat aphids, wheat mites, and other pests should vigorously carry out prevention and control, promptly eliminate pests, and prevent the spread of pests. Regions that have not yet found pests should educate farmers to inspect and prevent them early. Where there is a shortage of pesticides and equipment, effective methods created by farmers should be adopted to carry out prevention and control in a timely manner.

    Second, now is the time when wheat fields need a large amount of water. Regions with insufficient rainfall should make as much use as possible of existing water sources and irrigation equipment to actively carry out irrigation. Regions with sufficient rainfall and good soil moisture should seize the time to cultivate the wheat and preserve soil moisture while topdressing fertilizer. In some areas of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other provinces, wheat fields in low-lying areas have accumulated water, and ditches should be opened in time to drain the water and prevent waterlogging.

    Third, do a good job in frost prevention and post-frost rescue work. Regions that have not yet been affected by frost should adopt methods such as pressing down green manure, topdressing fertilizer (especially increasing the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers), irrigating, and cultivating wheat to make the wheat seedlings grow strong and enhance their resistance to cold. Regions with the conditions can also set up simple temperature forecasting equipment and listen to weather forecast broadcasts at any time so as to carry out frost prevention in a timely manner before frost occurs. Many agricultural cooperatives in southern Shanxi, with the assistance of local agricultural technology institutions, have established joint frost prevention command and intelligence organizations and installed simple temperature forecasting equipment, enabling them to prepare frost prevention materials in advance. This method is very good and deserves to be widely promoted. Regions that have already suffered frost damage should immediately inspect and take measures such as replanting seedlings, topdressing fertilizer, and irrigating to try to save the crop.

### 不要放松对麦田的管理

    不要放松对麦田的管理
    王志民
    入春以来，各地对麦田的管理比往年加强。麦田的灌溉面积普遍扩大，一般施肥量也比往年增加。但是，目前湖北、广西、山东、陕西、四川、江苏、安徽等省部分地区已经发现麦蜘蛛、麦蚜、粘虫等害虫。据检查，陕西省商南县永清区，每窝麦苗有二十个麦蜘蛛，严重的有一百五十多个；湖北襄阳县湾片乡有658亩小麦因蚜虫为害死光；广西蒙山县西河区有的麦田，麦叶被粘虫吃光。有些地区虽然降了春雨，但是雨量仍嫌不够，如陕西省入春以来降雨量比去年同期少三分之二。再根据几年来霜情发生的规律来看，在四月间，常有不同程度的霜冻灾害，对小麦生产的威胁很大。今年有的地区已经发生冻害。这些情况说明，为了争取小麦丰收，各地必须从几个方面做好麦田管理工作：
    第一、及时防治小麦害虫。目前已经发现麦蚜、麦蜘蛛等虫害的地区，要大力进行防治，及时消灭虫害，制止虫害蔓延。尚未发现虫害的地区，要教育农民及早检查、预防。农药、药械供应不足的地方，要采用农民创造的行之有效的办法，及时进行防治。
    第二、目前正是麦田需要大量水分的时候，雨水不足的地区，应该尽可能利用现有水源和灌溉用具，积极进行浇灌。雨水已经够了、墒情较好的地区，应该结合追肥，抓紧进行锄麦保墒工作。浙江、江苏等省有些地区的洼地的麦田已经积水，要及时开沟排水，防止淹涝。
    第三、做好霜冻预防和霜后抢救工作。目前未受冻的地区，要采取压青、追肥（尤其是增追磷钾质肥料）、灌溉和锄麦等办法，使麦苗生长健壮，增强抗寒能力。有条件的地区，还可设置简易的气温预测设备，并且随时收听气象预报广播，以便在临霜前及时进行预防霜害。山西晋南等地不少农业合作社在当地农业技术机构的协助下，建立了联合防冻指挥和情报组织，装置了简便气温预测设备，能够事先作好防冻物资准备。这个办法很好，值得广为提倡。已遭受冻害的地区，应该立即检查，采取补苗、追肥、灌溉等办法，尽力挽救。
