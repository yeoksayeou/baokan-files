Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th. The people on both banks of the Yellow River have safely passed the Peach Blossom Flood in this season of blooming peach and plum trees.

　　At 8:00 a.m. on the 7th, the flow rate at Qinchang, west of Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, was 1,070 cubic meters per second, a decrease of 1,580 cubic meters per second compared to the 2,650 cubic meters per second at 13:00 on the 2nd. When the flood peak reached Lijin County, Shandong Province at 8:00 a.m. on the 6th, the flow rate reached 2,950 cubic meters per second, decreasing to 1,840 cubic meters per second by 8:00 a.m. on the 7th. The flood peak has now flowed into the sea.

　　Due to prior protection measures, the low-lying areas of the Yellow River滩 (tān - sandbanks, shallows) and the heads of the low-lying串沟 (chuàngōu - interconnected gullies) did not overflow their banks when the flood peak passed, and the wheat seedlings on the滩 (tān) are growing vigorously. Currently, the dike construction project is being vigorously promoted.

    黄河桃汛安全度过
    新华社郑州8日电　在桃李竞芳的季节，黄河两岸人民安全度过了桃汛。
    七日八时河南省郑州市以西秦厂的流量是一零七零秒公方，比二日十三时的二六五零秒公方降落了一五八零秒公方。六日八时洪峰到达山东省利津县的时候，流量曾达到二九五零秒公方，至七日八时下降到一八四零秒公方。现在洪峰已经下泄入海。
    黄河河滩的低洼处和低洼的串沟沟头，由于预先做好防护，洪峰通过的时候没有出槽漫滩，滩地上的麦苗生长很旺。目前修堤工程正在紧张推进。
