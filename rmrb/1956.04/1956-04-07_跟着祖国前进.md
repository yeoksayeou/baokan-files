    Advance with the Motherland
    By Our Correspondent Jian Yuan
    Over a thousand family members of industrialists and businesspeople, and female industrialists and businesswomen, holding document bags, walked into the "CPPCC Auditorium," and sat down facing the huge red banner of the "National Representative Conference of Family Members of Industrialists and Businesspeople and Female Industrialists and Businesswomen." They listened wholeheartedly to a solemn voice: "Advance with the Motherland, Contribute to Socialism!"
    Some of them were only nineteen years old, while others were sixty-five-year-old women. Some had studied abroad, while others were not very literate, even illiterate. Some were family members of the largest industrialists and businesspeople in the country, while others came from "mom-and-pop stores." They were all very excited.
    What moved them the most was the report by Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation. Because this report spoke to their hearts, made them understand their future, and pointed out the direction of their efforts.
    Some of them originally had some concerns about accepting socialist transformation, but after listening to the report by Vice-Premier of the State Council Chen Yun, their concerns were dispelled.
    They had an unforgettable moment. At 4:00 PM on April 2nd, they met Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao took a photo with them. They felt that this was the most glorious moment of their lives. That day, they were so excited that they couldn't sleep late into the night, and were busy writing letters to their relatives to tell them their thoughts.
    "Advance with the Motherland, Contribute to Socialism!" They pondered, they wanted to respond to this solemn call.
    Jiang Bolan, a representative from Shanghai, whose husband is a private party member of the joint state-private "Guan Le Ming Gold Pen Factory," said: "In the past, I have already done some work to help my husband accept socialist transformation. In the future, I will further help my husband and encourage him to do a good job in the mutual assistance work among the industry during the full industry property inventory and asset verification of the pen-making industry." Yang Peizhen, a representative from Chongqing, Sichuan, whose husband is the capitalist of the Chongqing "Zhendan Machinery Factory," said: "In the past, I gave my husband ideas to oppress workers, and my husband listened to me very much; now I realize that those were bad ideas, and I also realize what are good ideas in socialist transformation. I should give my husband good ideas so that he can accept the transformation well." Not only Jiang Bolan and Yang Peizhen made such determination, but also many other representatives made such determination.
    Cai Aiwei, a representative from Tianjin, used to think that "only poor people should work," but now she is a person who is working hard to do a good job in housework. She wants to enable her husband to study and work with peace of mind. She feels that this is also quite good. She said that in the future, she will study labor even better. Zhang Binqi, a representative from Jinan, Shandong, said: "I realize that today's housework is also a part of social labor. In the future, I will cultivate simple living habits and take good care of my husband's daily life."
    Sheng? Chun, a representative from Changsha, Hunan, used to often encourage her husband to study hard, and when she read books and magazines such as "Chinese Women" and "Industry and Commerce," she would introduce the articles she thought were good to her husband. Every night, she arranges the children to do their homework together, and teaches the children to be quiet, so that their parents can also study well. She said that in the future, she will study more humbly, and at the same time encourage her husband to study and accept further transformation. Rukeya Musabayeva, a representative from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, also made the same firm statement to her sisters at the conference through translation.
    More than 14% of the representatives are female industrialists and businesswomen, and they are also equally excited. Yang Chengzhi, a representative from Beijing, was originally the manager of the joint state-private "Yipinzhai Shoe Store" in Beijing. She said: "I am now assigned to be the deputy manager of the Qianmen District Clothing, Shoes, and Hats Store of the Beijing Department Store Company. I am both happy and ashamed. In the future, I must work with industrialists and businesspeople across the country to do a good job in enterprise work, study business with a new attitude, accept workers' rationalization proposals, learn advanced experience, do a good job in supplying consumers, and strive to meet consumer needs." He Mu, a representative from Shanghai, is the capitalist agent of Shanghai Wing On Department Store. After the joint venture, she was assigned as the second deputy manager of the original company. She said: "Now I am responsible for the work of commodity circulation. Encouraged by the selfless labor enthusiasm of the workers, I want to change my past style and decide to get closer to the workers. In addition to planning business work, I also want to go to the sales departments of the shops to understand the situation and collect opinions, so as to make better work plans."
    The meeting closed. Family members of industrialists and businesspeople, and female industrialists and businesswomen earnestly exhorted each other: Hurry back and tell your relatives, tell all the sisters in the industrial and commercial circles: "Advance with the Motherland, Contribute to Socialism!"

    跟着祖国前进
    本报记者　鉴远
    上千个工商业者家属和女工商业者，手拿文件袋走进“政协礼堂”，面对着“全国工商业者家属和女工商业者代表会议”的巨幅红布标坐下来。她们同心听取一个庄严的声音：“跟着祖国前进，为社会主义贡献力量！”
    她们中有的还只是十九岁的年轻人，有的却是六十五岁的老太太。有的曾经在外国留学，有的却识字不多，甚至还是文盲。有的是国内最大的工商业者的家属，有的来自“夫妻老婆店”。她们都很兴奋。
    使她们最受感动的是全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超的报告。因为这个报告说透了她们的心事，使她们认清了自己的前途，给她们指出了努力的方向。
    她们中的一些人本来对接受社会主义改造还有某些顾虑，但在听了国务院陈云副总理的报告以后，她们的顾虑解除了。
    她们有一个永生难忘的时刻。四月二日下午四时，她们见到了毛主席，毛主席和她们一起照了相。她们觉得这是自己一生中最光荣的时刻。那天，她们兴奋得深夜不能入睡，忙着把自己的感想写信告诉亲人。
    “跟着祖国前进，为社会主义贡献力量！”她们思虑，她们要回答这个庄严的号召。
    上海市代表江伯兰，她丈夫是公私合营“关勒铭金笔厂”的私方人员。她说：“过去我已经做了些工作帮助丈夫接受社会主义改造，今后我要进一步帮助丈夫，鼓励他做好制笔工业全业清产核资中的同业互助工作。”四川重庆市代表杨培贞，她丈夫是重庆“震旦机器厂”的资方。她说：“以前我替丈夫出主意压迫工人，丈夫很听我的话；现在我认识了那是坏主意，也认识了社会主义改造中甚么是好主意。我该替丈夫出好主意，使他能很好地接受改造。”不只江伯兰和杨培贞这样下决心，还有许多代表都这样下了决心。
    天津市代表蔡爱维，以前认为“穷人才应该劳动”，可是现在她已经是一个努力于搞好家务的人。她要使丈夫安心学习，安心工作。她感到这也怪不错的。她说今后要更好地学习劳动。山东济南市代表张斌琪说：“我认识到今天的家务劳动也是社会劳动的一部分。今后，我要养成朴素的生活习惯，很好地照顾丈夫的日常生活。”
    湖南长沙市代表盛?纯，过去常鼓励丈夫努力学习，看“中国妇女”和“工商界”等书刊时，感到那一篇文章好，就介绍给丈夫看。每天晚上，她把孩子们安排在一起做功课，教孩子们安静，使爸爸妈妈也学习好。她说，今后她更要虚心学习，同时鼓励丈夫学习，接受进一步的改造。来自新疆维吾尔自治区的代表儒克娅·木沙巴也夫娃，也通过翻译在大会上向姐妹们坚决地作了同样的表示。
    代表中14％多是女工商业者，她们也同样兴奋。北京市代表杨承志，原是北京市公私合营“一品斋鞋店”的经理。她说：“我现在被分配到北京市百货公司前门区服装鞋帽店当副经理，我心里又是喜欢又是惭愧。今后我一定要和全国工商业者一道搞好企业工作，以新的态度钻研业务，接受职工合理化建议，学习先进经验，作好供应消费者的工作，为满足消费者需要而努力。”上海市代表何慕是上海永安百货公司的资方代理人。合营后她被分配为原公司的第二副经理。她说：“现在我负责商品流转方面的工作，在职工群众忘我劳动的热情鼓舞下，我要改变过去的作风，决定多接近职工，除了计划业务工作以外，也要到铺面各个销售部门了解情况，收集意见，把工作计划订得更好。”
    会议闭幕了。工商业者家属和女工商业者恳切相嘱：快回去告诉亲人，告诉所有工商界的姊妹们：“跟着祖国前进，为社会主义贡献力量！”
