Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 13th: According to the Jakarta "People's Daily" report on April 12th, Indonesian Communist Party Member of Parliament Lukman, when speaking at the parliamentary meeting on April 11th, called for national unity and cooperation to smoothly implement the new government's program.

The new Indonesian parliament began on April 11th to debate Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo's statement to the parliament on April 9th regarding the new government's program. After the debate, the parliament will hold a vote of confidence on April 19th.

Lukman said that the government's assessment of Indonesia's position in the current international situation is generally realistic, which can serve as the basis for its foreign policy. He welcomed the government's policy of not participating in political or military blocs and opposing the arms race.

Lukman said that the new government's peace policy has been strengthened by its declaration that it will expand and consolidate Indonesia's relations with all countries. He also said that another manifestation of the government's peaceful policy principles is its willingness to accept economic assistance from the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democracies, which will greatly contribute to Indonesia's national revival.

Lukman said that the Indonesian Communist Party fully supports the government's desire and actions to abolish all Round Table Conference agreements. He expressed hope that the government would not hesitate in taking measures to deal with the backlash from the Netherlands and its supporters against Indonesia's unilateral abolition of the agreement.

Lukman pointed out that some parts of the bill on the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements are ambiguous, and he suggested that it should also be clearly stated that the declaration on the transfer of sovereignty that mentioned the status of West Irian should be abolished. He asked the government to express its clear attitude towards Dutch enterprises, concessions, and privileges.

Lukman also hoped that the government would launch an international campaign to condemn the Netherlands' colonial crimes against the Indonesian residents of West Irian, and restrict or stop the activities of Dutch capital in Indonesia. He also called for the elimination of the ideological influence of colonialism on the people.

Lukman demanded that guarantees of broad democratic freedoms for the people and people's organizations should be specifically stipulated in the government's program. He pointed out that the provisions of the Indonesian Provisional Constitution regarding the basic rights of the people have been greatly restricted or even abolished due to past colonial rule.

    印度尼西亚共产党国会议员鲁克曼
    主张全国团结和合作顺利执行新政府的纲领
    新华社雅加达13日电　据雅加达“人民日报”四月十二日报道，印度尼西亚共产党国会议员鲁克曼四月十一日在国会会议上发言的时候，要求全国团结和合作来顺利地执行新政府的纲领。
    印度尼西亚新国会在四月十一日开始就沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理四月九日在国会发表的关于新政府纲领的声明进行辩论。在辩论后，国会将在四月十九日举行信任投票。
    鲁克曼说，政府对于印度尼西亚在目前的国际形势中所处的地位的估计是大体上现实的，这可以作为它的外交政策的基础。他欢迎政府的不参加政治或军事集团和反对扩军运动的政策。
    鲁克曼说，新政府的和平政策已经由于它声明它将扩大和巩固印度尼西亚同所有国家的关系而加强了。他又说，政府的和平政策原则的另一种表现就是它愿意接受苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的经济援助，这将大大地有助于印度尼西亚的国家复兴。
    鲁克曼说，印度尼西亚共产党完全支持政府废除全部圆桌会议协定的愿望和行动。他表示希望政府在对付荷兰和它的支持者对印度尼西亚单方面废除协定一举的反击采取措施时不要迟疑不决。
    鲁克曼指出，关于废除圆桌会议协定的法案，有些部分是含糊的，他建议也应当肯定地表明废除那个谈到西伊里安的地位的关于转移主权的宣言。他要求政府表示它对于荷兰企业、租让权和特权的明确的态度。
    鲁克曼还希望政府发动国际运动，谴责荷兰对于西伊里安的印度尼西亚居民的殖民罪行，并且限制或制止在印度尼西亚的荷兰资本的活动。他也要求清除殖民主义对人民的意识形态的影响。
    鲁克曼要求对于人民和人民团体的广泛的民主自由的保证应当具体地规定在政府的纲领中。他指出，印度尼西亚临时宪法关于人民基本权利的规定由于过去的殖民统治，曾经受到很大的限制，甚至被取消。
