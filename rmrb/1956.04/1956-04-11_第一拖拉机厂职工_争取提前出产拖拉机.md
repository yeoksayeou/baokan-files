    Workers of the First Tractor Factory
    Strive to Produce Tractors Ahead of Schedule
    (Our Newspaper) News - All the workers of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant recently put forward a guarantee at the local citywide labor model conference to strive to produce tractors ahead of schedule, and use this as a condition to launch a competition with large factories under construction throughout the country. Their guarantee is: based on the plan to produce tractors in the third quarter of 1959, they guarantee to put into full production two quarters ahead of schedule, and strive to produce tractors three quarters ahead of schedule. At the same time, they will strive to reach the original planned annual output for 1962 one year ahead of schedule, i.e., in 1961.
    Currently, all the workers in the factory are working hard to speed up the progress of the project. Engineer Liu Tianmin, who won the city's first-class labor model award, carefully reviewed the forging workshop drawings and corrected the error of not including nine pillars in the design, ensuring the timely comprehensive installation of the factory building. Engineers and technicians, when reviewing the construction organization design of the auxiliary workshops and repair and casting workshops, put forward thirty-one rationalization proposals, which accelerated the progress of the project and saved a lot of funds.

    第一拖拉机厂职工
    争取提前出产拖拉机
    本报讯　第一拖拉机制造厂全体职工最近在当地全市劳动模范大会上提出了争取提前出产拖拉机的保证，并且以此作为条件向全国正在兴建的大厂发起竞赛。他们的保证是：在1959年第三季度出产拖拉机的计划基础上，保证提前两个季度全面投入生产，争取提前三个季度出产拖拉机。同时，要争取提前一年，即在1961年达到原定1962年的年产量。
    目前，全厂职工正在为加快工程进度而努力。荣获全市一等劳动模范的工程师刘天民认真审查锻工场图纸，纠正了九根柱子没有列入设计内的差错，保证厂房及时进行综合安装。工程师、技术员在审查辅助工场、修铸工场的施工组织设计的时候，提出了三十一条合理化建议，加速了工程进度，并节约了大量资金。
