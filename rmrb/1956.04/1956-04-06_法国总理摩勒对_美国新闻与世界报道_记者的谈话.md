Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 3rd (TASS dispatch): Following are excerpts from the record of French Prime Minister Mollet's talk with a reporter from "U.S. News & World Report":

    Question: Is the Soviet Union's current change a real change in policy, or just a change in tactics?

    Answer: I didn't know before I took office. I still don't know now. I can say one more thing. You will never know, and I will never know, because this distinction between tactics and policy, between strategy and sincerity, is too formalized. To ask the question in this way is to say: The Russians are going to suddenly adopt some kind of strategy. However, Russia, like other countries, has its domestic problems and foreign relations problems. Russia has to pay attention to China. Russia has to consider internal demands, and consider satellite countries—Poland, Romania, and so on. Undeniably, the Russians have goals. What kind of goals? We cannot be sure. Will this goal not change? Possibly. Will it have some changes? Possibly. What is important for us to understand? That is, what is merely strategy in Russia today may become policy due to our actions.

    Question: Do you think it is possible for us to reach a genuine peace with the current Russian government, or do you think we are just continuing the past struggle in a different way?

    Answer: It is always possible to maintain peace with any form of government. One must never assume that the existence of a form of government that does not suit us will lead to war. In that case, the whole world can always find reasons to wage war. If people were to concern themselves with the form of government of their neighbors, there would be no peace in the world.

    Question: Do you believe that the threat of Soviet military aggression is gone?

    Answer: I never believed there was such a threat. I have not changed my mind. I don't believe it would be in Russia's interest. I believe the Russians cannot hope for war.

    Question: They don't object to small-scale wars, do they?

    Answer: They don't object to wars fought by others. But I don't believe they want a world war, because their technicians, their strategists, and their economists cannot face such a war without fear. They may win the first few battles. They know full well that they are very likely to lose this war. Besides, they paid a heavy price in the last war. I don't believe the Soviet Union wants war. What one can ask oneself is: Is Russia's will to expand still the same as before? We don't know. All we know is that if our attitude is positive, Russia's policy may evolve.

    Question: Then would you say that if the Russians have no intention of starting a war, the West no longer needs to maintain such a large armed force?

    Answer: Naturally not. If Russia does not reduce its military forces, there can be no question of us unilaterally reducing our military forces. If we did that, the argument I just made would be wrong. Russia cannot consider waging a war of aggression, because at present, its strategists and economists may believe that it would be defeated if it started a war. If we relax our defenses, they may consider waging war. Disarmament must be universal, otherwise there is no disarmament at all.

    Question: What kind of changes is the French government considering making in its foreign policy?

    Answer: In my authorization speech in the National Assembly, I said that the basic principles of our foreign policy remain the same as before. We are still determined to protect freedom where freedom is threatened, to make our contribution to the work of defending freedom, and to hope that others will cooperate in this work. But we are trying to get our partners in the Atlantic world to change their attitudes. We hope to better organize the work of defending freedom. The actions of Western countries in recent years have not been particularly successful.

    Question: Can you be more specific?

    Answer: For example, at the four-power foreign ministers' meeting in Geneva last November, they listed disarmament as the third issue, while disarmament should be the first issue.

    This should be the view of any government that cares about European unity. The European Commission supported this view last year. If other approaches are taken, one should not have any illusions that an agreement can be reached. This is an impossible dream. We don't know if the Russians want German unification. They may not even want it. But one thing is certain: if there is a possibility that the Russians want German unification, then this hope can only be truly seen within the scope of universal world disarmament. During rearmament, especially in the center of Europe, it is difficult to see Germany's reunification, even though the West has offered very important and specific security guarantees to the Russians, but for the Russians, this reunification will naturally become a rearmed Germany that fully participates in NATO. For the Russians, if we put ourselves in their place, of course this is hard to imagine. Conversely, if we solve the problem of universal disarmament first, then the issue of European security will be easier. This is the best way to solve this problem. And within the scope of security, Germany's unification becomes easier to achieve.

    Question: Do you think that after a universal disarmament agreement is reached, Germany will no longer be a member of NATO?

    Answer: It is not a question of requiring Germany to no longer belong to a security organization. In the first stage of the disarmament plan proposed by France and Britain, every country can remain in its current alliance, Western countries can remain in NATO, and Eastern countries can remain in the Warsaw Pact, but the armed forces and armaments of each country will be limited to an agreed level. In this way, once a disarmament agreement is reached, the expected number of German troops will be completely different. In the first stage of disarmament, all countries have to reduce the number of armed forces and certain types of armaments. At that time, international negotiations are very likely to lead to Russia agreeing to hold free elections in Germany. After the negotiations are held, Germany's position with regard to security organizations may change. I am not saying that this means that Germany is giving up its NATO membership. However, there may be discussions. But no one should ask now to decide Germany's future status.

    In answering another question, Mollet said that when we negotiate with the Russians, we really hope that the door is open for any suggestions. However, we ourselves place the primary emphasis on one suggestion—the suggestion of universal disarmament.

    When Mollet answered the question about whether he thought it was possible to have a unified Germany join the European Union, he said: "Of course there is a place for a unified Germany in the European Union, just as there is a place for the German Federal Army. But one thing is clear: if a unified or non-unified Germany were to join Europe economically, socially, and perhaps even politically within the scope of disarmament, it would be easier."

    When answering further questions about the European Union, Mollet emphasized that the proposal put forward by France regarding the signing of a treaty on the establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community stipulates that the production of nuclear weapons is prohibited.

    Someone asked Mollet if he thought that NATO could continue to exist in the future era of "coexistence." He replied: "It is necessary. I said that another attitude towards the relationship between the East and the West must be formulated. And we can only consider this other attitude under the condition that the West is consolidated and strong."

    In answering another question, Mollet expressed the hope that NATO would be able to develop economic cooperation quickly and that American troops would remain in Europe "as long as possible."

    Someone asked Mollet to explain what the difference was between the American disarmament proposal and the British and French disarmament proposals. Mollet said: "I don't think there is a big difference in principle. The difference lies in the way the issue is treated. This is the aspect of Western policy that I have regretted in recent years." We agree with the American view that we must do our best to strengthen our military security. But this is not the only problem in the world.

    If we always talk about security issues from a military point of view, then we will not be able to win the psychological warfare between the East and the West.

    Question: Why does the United States think that it is inappropriate to deal with the issue of disarmament through the principle of "step-by-step agreement"?

    Answer: The Russians have other ideas, so the Anglo-French plan attempts to synthesize various suggestions. It is not certain whether Russia will reject such a comprehensive plan, but what is certain is that Russia will continue to say that disarmament is the primary thing, but our American friends are so suspicious that they simply say "no." Every time the United States says "no," we lose a battle in world opinion. People come to the conclusion: "Then it is Russia that wants peace, and it is the United States that doesn't want peace."

    You Americans are not as harmed by this as in France, Italy, and other parts of Europe, where people support the communists based on this. Are we going to continue to make this psychological mistake? Are we going to continue to be the kind of people who seem to be saying, "We don't believe in reducing armaments, we don't believe in supervision"? This is the idea that I fear exists in the hearts of Americans. Some Americans have said: "Supervision is impossible." But one cannot say "supervision is impossible" and at the same time say: "We will agree to implement Eisenhower's plan." One cannot suggest aerial inspections around the world after saying "supervision is impossible." We French support Eisenhower's suggestion. Therefore, we think supervision is possible.

    Mollet answered the next question by saying that although France hopes to adopt new tactics, it is not right to say that France wants to be a "bridge" between the East and the West. Someone asked Mollet whether he and Pineau planned to try out new tactics when they visited Moscow. He replied: "We will discuss certain issues—especially Franco-Russian issues—and try to explore Russia's true intentions... No one can doubt our loyalty to the West, and after we return from Russia, no one can insist that we have played some kind of special French card."

    Mollet then expressed the view that the West's "incorrect methods" could be illustrated by taking Asia as an example. Mollet pointed out that "Khrushchev's trip and his promise to donate a set of hospital equipment caused unexpected reactions in India and the entire Far East." Then he said that this could be used to illustrate the Latin proverb: "The way of giving a gift is more important than what gift is given." Mollet pointed out the "arrogant" attitude of the people who distributed aid from the United States and the efforts of the American government to attach conditions to aid, and said: It is tantamount to giving nothing; that way you are doing a fool's bargain. Especially when you do this at the very moment when Russia and the Eastern bloc are making enormous efforts, when this new stage of their conflict with us is an economic stage. In this stage, the Russians will try to win over the Far East, then the Middle East, and then Africa through generous and completely selfless promises—at least they say so—while each of us, especially you, is working in isolation and often competing with each other. To understand this, you only need to look at what is happening in the Arab world, where each of us, in order to protect our own oil, is preparing to set the entire Middle East on fire.

    Someone asked Mollet what the way of providing aid should be. He replied that it should be joint rather than unilateral, and it must be done "selflessly." He also said that it would be "the best way" for the United Nations to provide such aid.

    Someone asked Mollet whether it was possible to reduce the number of votes for the Communist Party in France. He gave an affirmative answer. He said that, however, this cannot be achieved by using the American way of attacking communism without "knowing what communism is," because "the idea of communism itself is attractive to workers."

    Someone asked if there was a possibility of establishing a Popular Front. Mollet expressed confidence and said, "As long as I hold a responsible position in the government or serve as the leader of the Socialist Party," there will be no Popular Front.

    Someone asked Mollet what the basis was for the recent anti-American accusations in France. Mollet replied that the French are very sensitive on colonial issues. He also said: "Some second-rate American representatives in France don't behave very well... They lecture everyone... This enthusiasm of your people to lecture others is simply unimaginable. The harm they can cause you is astonishing. And as far as the French are concerned, apart from knowing that you massacre black people, they know nothing about the United States. As far as I know, there have been at most three or four cases of lynching in these past years, maybe five. But the French newspapers write about it enough to make an ordinary Frenchman believe that you kill a black person every three days. This is sad. This is the very bad role that newspapers play in two countries.

    "Precisely because French people have the impression of lynched black people, the regrettable trials in Mississippi, and a black girl being expelled from university in their minds, you can hear them say: 'They accuse us of being colonialists, but we have black students in the universities of Paris, Bordeaux, Algiers, and Lille.' They do not accept the advice and opinions of some people whom they think have made the same mistakes."

### 法国总理摩勒对“美国新闻与世界报道”记者的谈话

    法国总理摩勒对“美国新闻与世界报道”记者的谈话
    新华社讯　塔斯社纽约三日电：法国总理摩勒对“美国新闻与世界报道”记者的谈话记录，摘要如下：
    问：苏联目前是政策上的真正改变呢，还只是策略上的改变呢？
    答：我在就职以前是不知道的。现在我也不知道。我可以再说一句。你们永远不会知道，我也永远不会知道，因为策略和政策之间的这种区别，战略和诚意之间的这种区别是一种过于形式化的区别。这样提问题就等于说：俄国人是会这样突然地采取某种战略的。但是，俄国也同其他国家一样有它的国内问题和对外关系问题。俄国要注意到中国。俄国要考虑到内部要求、要考虑到卫星国——波兰、罗马尼亚等等。无可争辩，俄国人是有目的的。什么样的目的呢？我们不能肯定。这个目的是否不会改变呢？可能是的。它是否会有某些改变呢？可能。对我们来讲理解什么是重要的呢？那就是今天在俄国仅仅只是战略的东西可能由于我们的行动而变成政策。
    问：你认为我们有可能与现在的俄国政府达成一种真正的和平呢，还是认为我们只不过换一种方式继续进行过去的斗争？
    答：永远有可能与任何一种形式的政府保持和平。人们决不可首先就认为不合我们心意的政府形式的存在将导致战争。在那种情况下，全世界永远可以找到进行战争的理由。如果人们竟要关心他们的邻邦的政府形式的话，世界上将不会有和平。
    问：你是不是认为苏联军事侵略的威胁已经没有了？
    答：我从来不相信有这样一种威胁。我并没有改变我的想法。我不相信这会符合俄国的利益。我相信俄国人不能希望战争。
    问：他们不反对小规模战争，不是吗？
    答：不反对由别人来打的战争。但是我不相信他们希望一次世界大战，因为他们的技术人员、他们的战略家和他们的经济学家不能无所畏惧地去面对这种战争。他们可能赢得最初几个战役。他们清楚知道他们很可能打输这个战争。此外，他们在上次战争中已经付出了昂贵的代价。我不相信苏联希望战争。人们可以自问的是：俄国的扩张意志仍和从前一样吗？我们不知道。我们知道的只是：如果我们的态度是积极的，俄国的政策可能演变。
    问：那么你是否愿意说，如果俄国人没有发动战争的意图的话，西方就无须再维持这样大的武装力量了？
    答：自然不用。如果俄国不裁减它的军事部队，就谈不到我们方面单独裁减军事部队的问题。如果我们这样做了，我刚才提出的论点就会是错误的了。俄国不能考虑进行一场侵略战争，因为在目前，它的战略家和经济学家可能认为如果发动战争，它会遭到失败。如果我们放松我们的防务，他们就可能考虑进行战争。裁军必须是普遍的，否则就根本不裁军。
    问：法国政府在外交政策方面考虑做怎样的改变？
    答：我在国民议会的授权演说中曾说，我们的外交政策的基本原则仍和从前一样。我们仍然决心在自由遭到威胁的地方保护自由，对保卫自由的工作作出我们的贡献，并且希望其他的人在这个工作中进行合作。但是我们正在设法使我们在大西洋世界中的伙伴改变他们的态度。我们希望更好地组织保卫自由的工作。西方国家近几年来的行动并不是特别成功的。
    问：你能够说得更具体一些吗？
    答：譬如，在去年十一月的四国外长日内瓦会议上，他们把裁军列为第三个问题，而裁军问题应当列为第一个问题。
    这应该是任何关心欧洲团结的政府也具有的看法。去年欧洲委员会曾支持这种看法。要是采取其他做法，人们就不应该抱有任何认为能够达成协议的幻想。这是一个不可能实现的梦想。我们不知道俄国人是否希望德国统一。他们甚至可能不希望这样。但是有一件事情是肯定的：如果有俄国人希望德国统一的可能的话，那么只有在普遍的世界裁军的范围里才能真正看得见这个希望。在特别是在欧洲中心进行重新武装期间，很难看得见德国的重新统一，尽管西方向俄国人提出了非常重要和具体的安全保证，但是对俄国人来说，这种重新统一自然将成为一个重新武装起来的和完全参加北大西洋公约组织的德国。对于俄国人来说，如果我们设身处地来想一想，当然这是很难想像的。相反的，如果我们首先解决普遍裁军的问题，那么欧洲安全问题就比较容易了。这是解决这个问题的最好办法。而且在安全的范围之内，德国的统一也变得比较容易实现了。
    问：你是否认为在达成普遍裁军协议以后，德国将不再成为北大西洋公约组织的一员了？
    答：这不是要求德国不再属于安全组织的问题。在法国和英国所提出的裁军计划的第一阶段里，每一个国家都可以留在它目前的联盟内，西方国家可以留在北大西洋公约组织内，东方国家可以留在华沙条约内，但是，每一个国家的武装部队和军备将限制在一个商定的水平上。这样，一旦达成了裁军协议，预计的德国的军队的人数就会完全不同。在裁军的第一阶段，一切国家都得裁减武装部队和某些类型的军备的数目。到那个时候，国际谈判很可能导致俄国同意在德国举行自由选举。在举行了谈判之后，德国对安全组织而言的地位可能改变。我这并不是说，这意味着德国放弃它的北大西洋公约组织的成员资格。但是，会有可能进行讨论。但是现在谁也不应当要求现在就来决定德国的未来地位。
    在回答另一个问题时，摩勒说，我们在同俄国人谈判时真正希望大门是为任何建议敞开着。但是，我们自己是把首要的重点放在一个建议——普遍裁军建议上面的。
    摩勒在回答关于他是否认为有可能使统一后的德国加入欧洲联盟的问题的时候说道：“在欧洲联盟中当然有地位给统一后的德国，正像有地位给德意志联邦军队一样。但是有一点是明显的：如果在裁军的范围内使统一的或者没有统一的德国在经济、社会、也许甚至在政治方面加入欧洲，那就比较容易。”
    摩勒在回答关于欧洲联盟的进一步的问题的时候着重指出，法国提出的关于签订有关建立欧洲原子联营组织的条约的建议，规定禁止生产核子武器。
    有人问摩勒说，他认为北大西洋公约组织在今后的“共处”年代中是否能够存在下去，他回答说：“这是必要的。我说过必须拟订另一种对待东西方之间的关系的态度。而只有在西方是巩固和强大的条件下，我们才考虑这一另一态度。”
    在回答另一问题的时候，摩勒表示希望：北大西洋公约组织将能够很快地发展经济合作，美国军队将“尽可能长久地”留在欧洲。
    有人请摩勒解释一下：美国的裁军建议同英法的裁军建议有什么差别。摩勒说：“我不认为在原则上有很大差别。差别在于对待问题的方法。我就是对最近几年西方政策中的这一方面感到遗憾。”我们同意美国关于必须尽力加强我们的军事安全的看法。但是这不是世界上的唯一的问题。
    如果我们老是只从军事的观点来谈安全问题，那么我们将不能够赢得东方和西方之间的心理战。
    问：为什么美国认为通过“逐步协议”这个原则来处理裁军问题是不合适的呢？
    答：俄国人有别的主张，因此法英计划企图把各种建议综合起来。俄国是否会拒绝这样一个全面的计划，不一定，可以确定的是俄国会继续说裁军是首要的事，但是我们美国的朋友是这样的怀疑，他们干脆说“不”。美国每说一次“不”，我们在世界舆论中就打一次败仗。人们得出结论说：“那末要和平的是俄国，不要和平的是美国。”
    你们美国远不像在法国、意大利和欧洲其他地方那样因此受到损害，而在欧洲这些国家中，人民就根据这一点来支持共产党人。我们是否还要继续犯这种心理上的错误呢？我们是否还要继续做这样一种人，这种人似乎是在说，“我们并不相信裁减军备，我们并不相信监督”？这就是我担心在美国人的心中存在的想法。美国有人曾说：“监督是不可能的。”但是人们不能一面说“监督是不可能的”而同时又说：“我们会同意实施艾森豪威尔的计划”。人们不能在说“监督是不可能的”以后又建议在全世界进行空中视察。我们法国人赞成艾森豪威尔的建议。因此，我们认为监督是可能的。
    摩勒回答下一个问题说，虽然法国希望能采取新策略，但是说法国想成为东西方之间的“桥梁”这是不对的。有人问摩勒，他和比诺是否打算在访问莫斯科的时候试行一下新策略。他回答说：“我们将讨论某些问题——特别是法俄两国的问题，并且试图探究一下俄国的真正意图……没有人能够怀疑我们对西方的忠诚，将来我们从俄国回来后，任何人也不能硬说，我们摊了某种特出的法国牌。”
    摩勒接着表示意见说，西方的“方法的不正确”可以以亚洲为例来加以说明。摩勒指出，“赫鲁晓夫的旅行和他要赠送一所医院设备的诺言在印度和整个远东引起了料想不到的反应”，接着他说，这可以来说明这样一句拉丁谚语：“给礼物的方式比给什么礼物更重要”。摩勒指出了美国分发援助的人的“傲慢”态度和美国政府使援助附加条件的努力，并且说：便等于是什么也没有给；这样你就是干了一桩傻子的交易。尤其是，你们这样做的时候正就是俄国和东方集团在作巨大的努力的时候，在它们同我们的冲突的新阶段是一个经济阶段的时候。在这个阶段中，俄国人将通过慷慨的完全无私的诺言——至少他们是这样说——设法把远东争取过去，接着把中东争取过去，然后把非洲争取过去，而我们每一个人，特别是你们，却孤立地在干，而且常常彼此发生竞争。要想了解到这一点，你们只需要瞧一瞧在阿拉伯世界发生的情况，在那个地方，我们每一个人为了保卫自己的石油，正在准备使整个中东燃烧起来。
    有人问摩勒，援助的方式应该怎样。他回答说，它应该是共同的，而不是片面的，而且必需是“无私地”去做。他还说，由联合国出面进行这种援助是“最好的办法”。
    有人问摩勒，在法国，是不是可能使投共产党的票数减少，他作了肯定的答复。他说，但是，不能在“还不知道共产主义是什么东西”的情况下就用美国攻击共产主义的方式来达到这一目的，因为“共产主义思想本身对工人来说是有吸引力的”。
    有人问，是否有建立人民阵线的可能。摩勒表示信心说，“只要一天我还担当着政府的负责职务或者是担任着社会党的领导”，就不会有人民阵线。
    有人问摩勒，最近在法国发生的反美的指责的基础是什么。摩勒回答说，法国人在殖民问题上非常敏感。他还说：“在法国有些第二流的美国代表人物表现得不很好……他们对一切人都教训……你们的人的这种教训别人的热情简直是令人难以想像的。他们能够给你们造成的危害是惊人的。而在法国人这方面，除了知道你们残杀黑人外，对于美国是一无所知的。据我所知，在过去这些年中顶多发生过三起或四起使用私刑案，也可能是五起。但是法国报纸把它写得足以使一个普通法国人相信你们每隔三天就杀死一个黑人。这是可悲的。这就是报纸在两个国家中所起的很坏的作用。
    “正因为法国人脑筋里存在着受私刑的黑人、密士失必的令人遗憾的审讯、一个黑人女孩子被开除出大学的印象，你可以听到他们说：‘他们指责我们是殖民主义者，但是我们在巴黎、波尔多、阿尔及尔、里尔的大学中却有黑人学生。’他们不接受某些他们认为犯了同样错误的人们的忠告和意见。”
