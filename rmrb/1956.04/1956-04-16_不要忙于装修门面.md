    Don't Rush to Decorate the Facade
    To the Editor:
    In many areas of Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei Province, some phenomena of extravagance and waste have occurred during the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

    The department in Chengguan Town, Xinzhou County, responsible for the transformation of private commerce stipulated that the signs of all businesses, large and small, in the town must be "uniform," and all those that did not meet the prescribed format had to be remade. A meat retailer had a very good sign, but because it did not meet the "prescribed format," they spent more than 40 yuan to make a new one. Two old men selling cigarettes had very small businesses and unfixed locations, so they had no signs in the past. Now they are still selling cigarettes, but the personnel responsible for the transformation of private commerce believe that "the economic nature has changed," and insisted that they make large signs that were six feet long and seven inches wide. The hotel industry in Chengguan Town, Echeng County, had only 366 yuan in its own funds, but after accepting socialist transformation, they spent 584 yuan just on remaking signs and installing electric lights. According to preliminary statistics, during the transformation period, private businesses in various counties of Huanggang Prefecture spent more than 210,000 yuan just on whitewashing facades, installing glass counters, and installing electric lights.

    Why did this phenomenon of extravagance and waste occur? The main reason is that some personnel engaged in the transformation of private commerce mistakenly believe that "doing socialism must look like socialism." They forgot that it is precisely in doing socialism that we need to resolutely implement the policy of diligence and thrift, and oppose all phenomena of extravagance and waste. This phenomenon may also exist in other regions and deserves widespread attention.

    不要忙于装修门面编辑同志：
    湖北省黄冈专区不少地方在对私营工商业进行社会主义改造的工作中，发生了一些铺张浪费的现象。
    新洲县城关镇负责私营商业改造工作的部门规定全镇大小商业的招牌必须“整齐划一”，凡不合规定格式的一律要改制。屠宰业代销店原来就有一块很好的招牌，因为不合“规定格式”，又花了四十多元钱重新做了一块。有两个摆香烟摊的老头，因为生意很小，位置又不固定，过去就没有招牌。现在他们仍然是摆香烟摊子，但是负责私营商业改造工作的人员认为“经济性质变了”，也硬要他们做了六尺长、七寸宽的大招牌。鄂城县城关镇的客栈业自有资金只有366元，但是在接受社会主义改造以后，只是重新做招牌、装电灯就花了584元。据初步统计，黄冈专区各县的私营商业在改造期中，仅用于粉刷门面、装玻璃柜、装电灯的款项就有二十一万元以上。
    为什么会出现这种铺张浪费现象呢？主要原因是有些做私营商业改造工作的人员错误地认为“搞社会主义就得像个社会主义的样子”。他们忘掉了，正是搞社会主义，我们就更需要坚决执行勤俭经营的方针，反对一切铺张浪费现象。这种现象在其他地区可能也有，值得引起普遍的注意。
