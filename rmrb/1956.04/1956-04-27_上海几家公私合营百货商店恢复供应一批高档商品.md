Several joint state-private department stores in Shanghai, such as Wanxiang, Kaikai, and Xingtai, have decided to resume supplying high-end goods such as men's two-way shirts, dress shirts, and wool sweaters, to maintain and promote the original business characteristics of these enterprises. Beginning in April, they will continue to process and produce various colors of spun silk two-way shirts, 60-count and 80-count poplin shirts, and beige cashmere sweaters. To facilitate customers, these stores also accept custom orders for extra-large or extra-small sized shirts and two-way shirts of all styles. Due to careful calculations and reasonable cost reductions, the selling prices are also about 10% cheaper than in the past.
