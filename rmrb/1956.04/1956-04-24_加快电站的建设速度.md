Accelerate the Construction Speed of Power Plants
Zhang Bin, Director of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry

Under the new situation of the high tide of the socialist revolution, the state has put forward new requirements for power plant construction: we must greatly accelerate the construction speed of power plants, generate electricity ahead of schedule, and ensure a sufficient supply of electricity needed to accelerate the development of the national economy. The state requires that the construction period of power plants be shortened by another 30% within two years based on the original construction period. This means that the construction period of high-temperature and high-pressure large power stations should be shortened from sixteen to eighteen months to twelve to fourteen months; the construction period of medium-pressure medium-sized power stations should be shortened from fourteen months to completion within one year; and conditions should be prepared for further shortening the construction period for the second five-year plan.

Is it possible to achieve this requirement? Judging from the construction experience of power plants in our country, it is entirely possible to meet this requirement. In the first quarter of this year, the national electric power construction and installation projects completed 105.9% of the state plan, and the capacity put into production exceeded the state plan by 12%. Many important projects, such as the Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant and the Kaiyuan Power Plant, have been completed ahead of schedule. The problem now is to conscientiously study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and domestic experiences, and improve the management and technical work of each project to an advanced level.

Expanding the proportion of prefabricated assembly projects and the weight of components in civil construction engineering, expanding the assembly rate and range in installation, and doing a good job of prefabrication, assembly, test operation and all preparations before installation and operation to reduce on-site installation time are advanced methods that have proven effective in shortening the construction period of power plants. Many civil construction sites have expanded the proportion of prefabricated assembly of civil structures to 40% of the entire project, which has greatly shortened the construction period and created conditions for entering equipment installation ahead of schedule. For example, the prefabrication method of cable trenches that has been tried on many sites can shorten the on-site construction time of this project by 40%; using the prefabrication assembly method to construct equipment foundation projects under six tons can shorten the construction period by about ten days; expanding the plane of prefabricated roof panel components by two times and prefabricating foamed concrete at one time can shorten the roof assembly time by 60%. In terms of installation, according to general measurements, each ton of boiler components requires 80 man-hours for piecemeal installation, while using the combined installation method only requires 8.4 man-hours, with an efficiency increase of nearly ten times. Each motorized equipment and various operating systems can undergo static, dynamic, and other adjustment operation tests before or after installation to ensure that each part is completely safe and reliable before the entire set of trial operations, which can shorten the overall adjustment and trial operation time of the entire production process and put it into production ahead of schedule. Expanding prefabrication, assembly, and pre-testing in construction and installation can also improve the processing quality of each part, eliminate intermediate shutdowns caused by quality accidents, and make shortening the construction period more reliable.

Carefully arranging balanced flow operations and parallel crossover operations between various processes, and organizing close collaboration and mutual cooperation in overall construction, are extremely important organizational measures for shortening the construction period. The balanced flow operation of each process is the basic method to speed up construction by rationally organizing the processes. The largest workload in civil construction is concrete engineering. If formwork support, rebar binding, concrete pouring and other processes are reasonably arranged in the concrete project, and balanced flow operation is organized, it can eliminate the abnormal phenomena of idleness and peak rush work caused by the disconnection between processes, which is generally found on site, and speed up the progress of the project. In installation, the Dalian Power Plant turbine site organized parallel crossover operations, shortening the construction period by twelve days. It is especially important that if parallel crossover operations between civil construction and installation, the two major professional constructions, can be organized, so that civil construction can create conditions for installation in a planned way, and make installation enter the plant and civil construction engineering for parallel operations in advance, strive to advance the overall progress, and achieve the goal of entering installation in large plants in about seven months. This can create reliable conditions for a large power plant to be put into production in twelve months.

Improving the degree and efficiency of construction mechanization is an effective way to shorten the construction period. Electric power construction units already have a large number of construction machinery, and although some construction sites are still insufficient, they have been supplemented this year. The main problem now is how to efficiently utilize mechanical tools in a planned way. For example, many construction sites have six-ton tower cranes, but the average hoisting unit weight only reaches 20%, and the utilization rate of each machine is only about 30 shifts per month on average; if the hoisting unit weight is increased to 80%, the efficiency of vertical transportation can be relatively increased by four times. If the utilization rate of each crane is increased to 40 or 50 shifts per month, the vertical transportation efficiency can also be increased by 20%.

Actively learning and mastering new technologies, promoting advanced experience, and breaking unreasonable old rules and regulations in construction methods can tap the huge potential to accelerate speed. For example, many sites use narrow experience to stipulate the time for removing formwork, and stipulate it rigidly, but considering the different temperature and time requirements of various structures, this regulation can be changed, and generally the removal time can be advanced by three or four days compared with the specified removal time. This not only speeds up the flow operation of concrete pouring, but also provides better conditions for other processes to proceed in advance. In the installation, there was also a fixed regulation for the baking time of the boiler in the past. Regardless of the humidity of the furnace wall, it must be baked for three to five days. However, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union proves that if the humidity of the furnace wall does not exceed 7%, the furnace baking should no longer be regarded as a separate process, and can be carried out together with the boiling furnace process, shortening the independent furnace baking time. In recent years, our workers and engineering technicians have also created many advanced experiences. For example, in the 652 project, Wang Guilin created the segmented bricklaying method for furnace walls, shortening the boiler installation period by one month.

Ensuring project quality is the foundation for ensuring project progress. Poor quality, no matter how fast it is done, is harmful and not beneficial. It not only harms the country's construction, but ultimately rework and repairs will still delay progress. Therefore, we require that the quality of each sub-item project be effectively guaranteed, and the intermediate repairs, intermediate shutdowns, and intermediate reworks caused by poor project quality be eliminated, so that the quality of each sub-item project is qualified at one time, each sub-unit test is successful at one time, and finally the 72-hour complete set of trial operation is completed at one time. Many units have now formulated specific measures to meet the requirements of one-time qualification. For example, the concrete quality of the turbine pedestals in several key projects has reached the standard of first-class products, many boiler hydraulic tests have been successful at one time, and all 7,800 welds in a high-pressure construction site have passed the test, and several units have achieved the 72-hour complete set of trial operation at one time. These all prove that as long as active measures are taken, the quality can meet the requirements of one-time qualification and all excellent.

Strengthening planning management, improving labor organization, and improving the wage system are also important aspects of promoting the shortening of the construction period. The correctness of the construction plan should be used, and the progress of the project should be guaranteed by the plan arranged on a daily and hourly basis. The generator part of the Fushun Power Plant project adopted a progress plan arranged on an hourly basis, creating a record of completing the installation of a large generator in fifteen days. In the last two months of construction at the 306 construction site, a detailed progress plan was also prepared on an hourly basis to ensure on-time power generation. This kind of detailed plan organization work is an important measure to put the advanced progress plan on a reliable basis. The mixed class organization form adopted by the Shijiazhuang construction site in labor organization greatly improved work efficiency and reduced on-site piecemeal scheduling and intermediate shutdowns, so that the effective working hours increased from 76% to 90%, directly improving the work efficiency of each team by about 20%. This experience has opened up a road for us to shorten the construction period by improving labor organization, proving that there is also great potential in this regard. In addition, according to the results of measurements on construction sites that have effectively implemented the piece-rate wage system, correct implementation of the piece-rate wage system can save about 20% of the labor quota in the construction budget. This not only saves skilled workers and increases workers' income, but also relatively shortens the progress of each sub-item project by about 10%.

The enthusiasm of electric power workers for building socialism is full. As long as the leadership breaks conservative thinking, implements the policy of strengthening leadership through comprehensive planning, fully mobilizes the masses, and effectively improves leadership work, it is entirely possible to build more and better power plants with less funds and faster speed.

    加快电站的建设速度
    电力工业部基本建设总局局长  张彬
    在社会主义革命高潮的新形势下，国家对电站建设提出了新的要求：必须大大加快电站建设速度，提前发电，保证充分供应为了加快国民经济的发展所需要的电力。国家要求二年内电站的建设在原定建设工期的基础上再缩短30％。这就是说：高温高压的大型电站的工期要自十六到十八个月缩短为十二到十四个月；中压的中型电站的工期要自十四个月缩短为在一年内竣工；并且要为第二个五年计划进一步缩短工期准备条件。
    这个要求有没有可能实现呢？从我国电站的建设经验来看，达到这个要求是完全可能的。今年第一季度，全国电业的建筑安装工程完成了国家计划的105.9％，投入生产的容量超过国家计划12％，许多重要工程，如石家庄热电站，开远电站等都已经提前竣工。现在的问题在于认真地学习苏联的和国内的先进经验，把每一个工程的管理工作和技术工作都提高到先进的水平上来。
    扩大土木建筑工程中预制装配工程的比重和构件的重量，扩大安装中的组合率和组合范围，做好安装和运转前事先的预制、组合、试运等一切准备工作，减少现场安装的时间，是已有成效的缩短电站建筑安装工期的先进方法。许多土木建筑工地把土木结构预制装配比重扩大到全工程的40％，就大大缩短了建筑工期，给提前进入设备安装创造了条件，例如许多现场已经试用的电缆沟道的预制方法，可以把这一项工程在现场施工的时间缩短40％；用预制装配方法施工六吨以下的设备基础工程，可以缩短工期十天左右；把屋面板预制件的平面扩大两倍，并且把泡沫混凝土一次预制，就可以把屋面装配时间缩短60％。在安装方面，据一般测定，锅炉的每一吨部件用零碎的办法安装，需八十个工时，如果采用组合安装的办法只要八点四个工时，效率提高将近十倍。每个机动设备和各类运行系统都能在安装前或安装后，做好静态、动态等调整运转试验，保证在整套试运转前各个部分完全安全可靠，可以缩短全部生产过程的整套调整试运时间，提前投入生产。扩大建筑安装中的预制组合和预试，还能提高各个部分的加工质量，消除由于质量事故而产生的中间停工，使缩短工期更加可靠。
    周密地安排各个工序间的均衡流水作业和平行交叉作业，组织密切协作，互相配合的整体施工，是缩短工期极其重要的组织措施。每个工序的均衡流水作业，是通过合理组织工序来加快施工的基本方法。土木建筑施工中工作量最大的是混凝土工程，如果在混凝土工程中合理地安排支模、钢筋绑扎，混凝土浇灌等工序，组织均衡的流水作业，就可以消除一般现场普遍存在的因为工序间的脱节而产生的窝工、高峰赶工等不正常现象，加快工程进度。在安装中，大连电站汽机工地组织平行交叉作业，把工期缩短了十二天。特别重要的是如果能够组织土木建筑和安装两个大专业施工中的平行交叉作业，让土木建筑有计划地给安装创造条件，使安装提前进入厂房和土木建筑工程平行作业，争取把总的进度提前，做到大型厂房在七个月左右进入安装，这就可以为一个大型电站在十二个月投入生产创造可靠的条件。
    提高施工机械化的程度和效率是缩短工期的一个有效办法。电业建设单位已经拥有大量施工机械，有些工地虽还不足，但是今年已经得到补充。目前的主要问题是如何有计划地发挥机械工具的效率。例如许多工地都有六吨的塔式起重机，但是起吊单位重量平均只达20％，每台机械的利用率平均每月只有三十个台班左右；如果把起吊单位重量提高到80％，垂直运输的效率就可相对地提高四倍，如果把每台起重机的利用率提高到每月四十或五十个台班，垂直运输效率还可以提高20％。
    积极学习和掌握新技术，推广先进经验，打破施工方法中不合理的陈规旧律，可以发掘出巨大的加快速度的潜力。例如许多现场都以狭隘经验来规定拆除模板的时间，并且规定得死死的，但是根据各种不同结构要求的不同温度和时间来考虑，这种规定是可以变更的，一般都可以比规定的拆除时间提早三、四天。这不仅加快了混凝土浇灌的流水作业，也有了更好的条件使其他工序提前进行。在安装中对锅炉的烘烤时间，过去也有过一成不变的规定，不管炉墙湿度如何，一律要烘烤三天到五天。但是苏联的先进经验证明，如果炉墙湿度不超过7％，就不应该再把烘炉当作一项单独的工序来进行，可以和煮炉的工序一起进行，缩短独立烘炉的时间。这几年来，我们的工人和工程技术人员也创造了许多先进经验，例如六五二工程中，王桂林创造了炉墙分段砌砖法，使锅炉安装工期缩短了一个月。
    保证工程质量是保证工程进度的基础。质量不好，干得再快，是有百害而无一利的。它不仅贻害国家的建设，而且最后返工补修，还是耽误进度。因此，我们要求切实保证每个分项工程的质量，消除由于工程质量不好而产生的中间补修、中间停工、中间返工等现象，做到每个分项工程的质量一次合格，每个分部试验一次成功，最后达到七十二小时整套试运一次完成。现在已经有许多单位制定了具体措施，达到了一次合格的要求。如几个重点工程汽机座子的混凝土质量都达到了一级品的标准，许多锅炉水压试验都一次成功，一个高压工地的七千八百个焊口全部试验合格，有几个机组都达到七十二小时整套试运转一次完成。这些都证明了只要采取积极措施，质量是可以达到一次合格、全部优良的要求的。
    加强计划管理，改善劳动组织，改善工资制度，也是推动缩短工期的一个重要方面。应该用施工计划的正确性，用按日、按小时编排的计划来保证工程进度。抚顺电站工程发电机部分，采用按小时编排的进度计划，创造了十五天完成一台大型发电机安装的纪录，三○六工地施工的最后两个月里，也曾按小时编制了周密的进度计划，保证了按时发电。这种周密的计划组织工作，是把先进进度计划放在可靠的基础上的重要措施。石家庄工地在劳动组织上采取的混合班的组织形式，大大提高工作效率，减少了现场的零碎调度和中间停工，使有效工时自76％提高到90％，直接提高了每个班组的工作效率20％左右。这个经验为我们开辟了一条从改善劳动组织来缩短工期的道路，证明了在这方面也有很大的潜力。此外，根据已经推行计件工资制度有成效的工地测算的结果证明，正确的执行计件工资制度，在施工预算上，可以节省人工定额20％左右。这不但节省了技术工人，增加了工人收入，而且也相对的缩短了每一个分项工程的进度10％左右。
    电业职工建设社会主义的热情是饱满的，只要领导上打破保守思想，贯彻执行全面规划加强领导的方针，充分发动群众，切实改进领导工作，用更少的资金，更快地建设更多、更好的电站是完全可能的。
