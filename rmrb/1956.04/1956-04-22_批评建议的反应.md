    Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    A letter from the Changzhi Machinery Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Shanxi Province: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" column on February 14th that the quality of the bearings produced by our factory is substandard is entirely correct. We have serious capitalist management ideologies, focusing one-sidedly on increasing output and relaxing quality inspections, resulting in significant losses to the state. We will definitely pay attention to overcoming this shortcoming in the future.

    A letter from the Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory, a state-owned enterprise: After the "Reader's Letters" column published the letter "Why Are There Broken Pieces of Glass in the Pills" on February 14th, we immediately conducted an inspection and broadcast this criticism to all employees in the factory. We guarantee that similar situations will not occur again in the future.

    批评建议的反应
    山西省地方国营长治机械厂来信：二月十四日“读者来信专页”批评我厂生产的轴承质量低劣，这是十分正确的。我们存在着严重的资本主义经营思想，片面地注意提高产量，放松了对质量的检查，以致给国家造成了很大的损失。今后我们一定注意克服这个缺点。

    国营武汉制药厂来信：二月十四日“读者来信专页”刊登了“药片里为什么会有碎玻璃”的来信以后，我们立即进行了检查，并且把这篇批评信在厂内向全体职工广播。我们保证今后不再发生类似情况。
