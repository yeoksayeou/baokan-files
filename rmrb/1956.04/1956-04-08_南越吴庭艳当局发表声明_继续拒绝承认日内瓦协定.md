Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th - Saigon News: The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem authorities issued a statement on April 6th, openly declaring that they continue to refuse to recognize the Geneva Accords.

    In this statement, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities insisted on their past unreasonable position, saying that they "did not sign the Geneva Accords (ending the Indochina War), and they continue to refuse to recognize the provisions of this agreement."

    The Ngo Dinh Diem authorities declared in the statement that they would only treat the Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission as an "organization dedicated to peace" and "cooperate" with it, thus completely denying the legal status of the International Commission in being responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the various clauses of the Geneva Accords by the two sides of the ceasefire. Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently stated that if South Vietnam does not recognize the Geneva Accords, it would no longer be useful for the International Commission to remain in Vietnam.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem authorities further stated in the statement that South Vietnam "does not consider it necessary to participate in any military alliances" and cannot agree to "foreign troops being stationed on its territory or to granting military bases." According to the explicit provisions of the Geneva Accords, the two sides of the ceasefire are originally not allowed to participate in any military alliances or establish foreign military bases.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem authorities emphasized maintaining the current division of Vietnam and continued to refuse to achieve the unification of Vietnam through comprehensive free general elections. The statement repeated the old tune that free general elections throughout Vietnam can only be held under "sufficiently free conditions" deemed by the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities.

    The Ngo Dinh Diem authorities stated in the statement that the delegations of France and the South Vietnamese authorities signed a document on March 20th, which stipulated the date for the withdrawal of French troops from South Vietnam. However, the statement completely avoided the important question of who will inherit its tasks after the French military headquarters withdraws from South Vietnam on April 28th. As is well known, the Vietnam International Commission has long stated that if South Vietnam refuses to inherit the obligations undertaken by France under the Geneva Accords, a serious situation will result.

### 南越吴庭艳当局发表声明  继续拒绝承认日内瓦协定

    南越吴庭艳当局发表声明
    继续拒绝承认日内瓦协定
    新华社河内7日电　西贡消息：南越吴庭艳当局在四月六日发表了一个声明，公然宣布它继续拒绝承认日内瓦协定。
    吴庭艳当局在这个声明中坚持它过去的无理立场说：它“没有在（结束印度支那战争的）日内瓦协定上签字，它继续拒绝承认这个协定的规定”。
    吴庭艳当局在声明中宣布它将只把越南国际监督和监察委员会当作一个“致力于和平的组织”而与之“合作”，这样就完全否定了国际委员会在负责监督和监察停战双方执行日内瓦协定各项条款的法律地位。印度总理尼赫鲁最近还曾经说过，如果南越不承认日内瓦协定，国际委员会继续留在越南就不再会有什么用处。
    吴庭艳当局在声明中又说，南越“并不认为它有必要参加任何军事联盟”，而且不能同意“外国军队驻扎在它的领土上或者给予军事基地”。根据日内瓦协议的明文规定，停战双方本来就是不能参加任何军事同盟和建立外国军事基地的。
    吴庭艳当局强调要保持目前越南的分裂状况，继续拒绝通过全面自由普选来实现越南的统一。这个声明重弹老调说，越南全国的自由普选只有在被吴庭艳当局认为有“足够自由的条件”下才能举行。
    吴庭艳当局在声明中说，法国和南越当局的代表团已经于三月二十日签订了一项文件，这个文件规定了法国军队撤离南越的日期。但是，声明对法军总司令部在四月二十八日撤出南越以后谁将继承它的任务的这个重要的问题却完全避而不谈。而大家知道，越南国际委员会早已表示，如果南越拒绝继承法国根据日内瓦协定所承担的义务，结果将产生严重的局势。
