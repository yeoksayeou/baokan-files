Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, April 20th: Just as the Bandung Conference was celebrating its first anniversary, the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation held its first performance in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, on the evening of April 18th.

    The Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Sudan, Sayed Sir-el-Khatim El Khalifa, and members of the Council, as well as the Sudanese Acting Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supply, Ibrahim El Mufti, watched the performance. Also in attendance were Sudanese government ministers and senior officials, diplomatic envoys and commercial representatives from various countries stationed in Sudan, and more than 800 people from Sudanese cultural, artistic, industrial, commercial, religious, and journalistic circles.

    The Sudanese and Chinese flags were hung on the stage of the Khartoum Cultural Club.

    Bao Erhan, head of the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation, delivered a speech before the performance began. He said that the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation’s friendly visit and performance in Sudan was the result of the implementation of the Bandung Conference's agreement on cultural exchange and friendly cooperation. The delegation will introduce Chinese art to the Sudanese people through performances, and at the same time will learn from outstanding Sudanese art and bring it back to the Chinese people, thereby promoting mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between the two countries.

    Sudanese Acting Prime Minister Mufti also spoke. He said: "The Bandung Conference was a turning point in international relations and relations between peoples of all countries. If the principles of the Bandung Conference can be realized in all countries, then the world can achieve peace." He said that he believed that through the delegation's visit and performance, the friendship between the Sudanese and Chinese people would be enhanced.

    In this performance, Chinese artists publicly performed Chinese classical dances, folk dances, and other programs, and sang Sudanese songs they had just learned.

    The audience greatly appreciated the beautiful Chinese art, and they were excited about the performance of Sudanese programs, with many people humming along with the singers.

    Many newspapers in Khartoum devoted important sections to reporting on the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation's performance in Khartoum. "New Sudan" and "Al-Istiqlal" published articles commenting on Chinese classical opera.
