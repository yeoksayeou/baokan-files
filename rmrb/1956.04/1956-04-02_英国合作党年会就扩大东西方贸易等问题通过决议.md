Xinhua News Agency, London, April 1st: The British Co-operative Party, with over ten million members, is holding its annual meeting in Weymouth. The meeting has already passed resolutions on important issues such as expanding East-West trade, banning nuclear weapons, reducing British government military spending, and British policy towards Cyprus.

    The meeting placed great emphasis on the issue of expanding trade between East and West. The meeting passed a resolution calling on the British government to conclude a trade agreement with the German Democratic Republic, and calling on the Co-operative Party National Committee to discuss the issue of cooperative social exchange of goods with the German Democratic Republic.

    Gordon Schaffer, chairman of the London Co-operative Society, strongly condemned the US-imposed policy of prohibiting trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies when speaking in support of this draft resolution.

    The meeting also passed another resolution calling on the Co-operative Party National Committee to take all means to put pressure on the British government to expand trade with the People's Republic of China.

    The resolution demanding that the British government "firmly advocate a ban on the testing of nuclear weapons and a complete ban on nuclear weapons" was unanimously adopted by the conference.

    When discussing the draft resolution on reducing military expenditure, a representative said that nearly half of every pound of tax revenue in Britain, namely nine shillings and seven pence, is spent on military expenditure, whereas five years ago it was only six shillings and seven pence spent on military purposes. The representatives emphasized that the huge military expenditure has become the main source of the current inflation in Britain and has undermined the competitiveness of British goods in the world market. This resolution was also unanimously passed by the annual meeting.

    The meeting also passed a resolution condemning the government's policy towards Cyprus, demanding a solution to the Cyprus issue on the basis of self-determination.

    英国合作党年会就扩大东西方贸易等问题通过决议
    新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：有着一千多万党员的英国合作党正在韦马斯举行年会。年会已经就扩大东西方贸易、禁止核子武器、减少英国政府军费开支以及英国对塞浦路斯政策等重要问题通过了决议。
    会议十分重视关于扩大东西方之间的贸易的问题。会议通过决议，要求英国政府同德意志民主共和国缔结贸易协定，要求合作党全国委员会讨论关于同德意志民主共和国合作社交换商品的问题。
    伦敦合作社主席戈登·夏菲尔在发言支持这一个决议草案的时候，强烈谴责了美国所强加的禁止同苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家进行贸易的政策。
    会议还通过了另一项决议，要求合作党全国委员会采取一切手段，对英国政府施加压力，以求扩大同中华人民共和国的贸易。
    关于要求英国政府“坚决主张禁止试验核子武器和完全禁止核子武器”的决议是大会一致通过的。
    在讨论裁减军事开支的决议草案的时候，有代表发言说：英国现在每收一英镑税，就有将近一半，即九先令七辨士花在军费上，而在五年以前还只有六先令七辨士花在军事用途上。代表们着重指出了，巨额的军事开支已成为英国目前通货膨胀的主要根源，并且破坏了英国商品在世界市场上的竞争能力。这个决议也为年会一致表决通过。
    会议还通过了一个决议，这个决议谴责政府对待塞浦路斯的政策，决议要求在自决的基础上解决塞浦路斯问题。
