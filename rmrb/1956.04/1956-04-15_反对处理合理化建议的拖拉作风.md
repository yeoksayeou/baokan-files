    Since Heilongjiang Province launched the advanced producer movement, more than 27,000 rationalization proposals have emerged, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. When dealing with rationalization proposals, some enterprises first conduct review and appraisal in the workshop, immediately implementing some simpler suggestions. For major technical measures that the workshop cannot solve, they propose handling opinions and submit them to the factory for resolution. However, some enterprises treat rationalization proposals as if they were kicking a football, delaying their handling and arousing dissatisfaction among workers.
    The Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant is doing a good job in handling rationalization proposals. For example, Huang Chengxue, the technician in the mechanical workshop responsible for handling rationalization proposals, carefully studied the 155 rationalization proposals submitted by the entire workshop. He consolidated them into eight advanced experiences that could be immediately promoted and initially planned to implement them on 50 kinds of parts. When he specifically introduced these eight advanced experiences to the workers, he repeatedly studied them with the workers, trying to expand the scope of application as much as possible. As a result, 278 kinds of parts could be used, shortening the average working hours by about one-third. Huang Chengxue once spent a short period of time specifically extracting a machine tool to manufacture the new type of tool proposed in the rationalization proposal. When he began to use these new tools, he personally tested them, and only handed them over to the workers after they were successful.
    The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant is also doing a good job. The rationalization proposals in the passenger car workshop are handled by process engineer Li Yuanpei. He specially set up a rationalization proposal reception room to solicit the opinions of the original proposers in detail. As the number of rationalization proposals increased, he absorbed one or two technicians from each type of work to jointly appraise the rationalization proposals. When encountering major suggestions, he submitted them to the factory's technical department for resolution. For some rationalization proposals that could be promoted with only a rough sketch, he handed them over to the workers for promotion on the spot. He formulated a promotion plan, detailing which rationalization proposals could be promoted on which machine tools within a few days. After the rationalization proposal was implemented, he immediately published the news on the workshop blackboard newspaper, stating how much value the rationalization proposal created for the country and how much bonus the proponent should receive, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the workers.
    The Harbin Cement Plant is of a different type. In this factory, several times more buckets are needed to transport clay in winter. On December 10th last year, Su Zhenyu and another worker from the calcination workshop suggested installing "big teeth" on the crane's lifting bucket, so that there would be no need to increase the number of buckets. This rationalization proposal traveled for three months before being adopted, and it will not be put into production until April. However, in April, the ground has already thawed, the clay has long been loose, and there is no need to install "big teeth." Upon investigation, the workshop complained that the chief mechanical engineer's office did not pay attention to rationalization proposals; the leaders of the chief mechanical engineer's office complained that the technical section did not explain the importance of the proposal; the technical section said: We have already submitted the drawings, we are not responsible for anything else.
    In the Jiamusi Machinery Plant, a rationalization proposal has to go through "four major steps and ten processes" from proposal to handling. Li Shaochun, an accountant in the third workshop of the Mudanjiang Rubber Factory, proposed to repair old screws, so that there would be no need to buy them from outside for two years. However, the person in charge of rationalization proposals wanted him to guarantee that he would not buy new screws for two years, otherwise it would not be considered.
    In order to encourage workers to put forward more rationalization proposals, so as to complete the national plan faster, more, better and more economically, every enterprise must fight against the phenomenon of backlog of rationalization proposals, change the lazy work style, and change the "systems" and "procedures" that bind the enthusiasm of the masses. We must learn from the advanced practices of Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant and Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant.

    反对处理合理化建议的拖拉作风
    本报记者　方青
    黑龙江省自从开展先进生产者运动以来，出现了两万七千多件合理化建议，这是十分可喜的现象。在处理合理化建议的时候，有的企业先在车间审查鉴定，把一些比较简易的建议立即付诸实现，对于车间不能解决的重大技术措施，就提出处理意见，交厂部解决。而有些企业对合理化建议，好像踢皮球一样，迟迟不处理，引起职工的不满。
    齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂处理合理化建议的工作是好的。如机械车间负责处理合理化建议的技术员黄成学，仔细研究了全车间提出的155件合理化建议，把它们归并成八种可以立即推广的先进经验，初步计划可以在五十种部件上推行。他把这八种先进经验具体向工人介绍的时候，又反复和工人研究，尽量扩大应用范围，结果有278种部件都可以采用，平均缩短工时约三分之一。黄成学曾经在短期内专门抽出一台机床，制造合理化建议所提出来的新型刀具。在开始使用这些新型刀具的时候，他又亲自试验，成功后才交给工人使用。
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂的工作也做得不错。客车车间的合理化建议是由工艺工程师李元沛负责处理的。他专门设立了合理化建议接待室，以便详细征求原提议人的意见。合理化建议多起来了，他又按照不同的工种，分别吸收各该种技术工人一两名，共同鉴定合理化建议。遇到重大的建议，他就交厂部技术部门解决。有些只画一个草图就能推行的合理化建议，他就当面交给工人去推广。他制定了推广计划，详细说明哪项合理化建议，在几天以内，可以在哪几台机床上推行。合理化建议实现以后，他马上在车间黑板报上发表消息，说明这个合理化建议给国家创造多少价值，倡议人应得多少奖金，以鼓励职工的积极性。
    哈尔滨水泥厂则是另一种类型。这个厂冬季搬运粘土，需要增加好几倍的吊桶。烧成车间工人苏振玉等二人，在去年十二月十日建议在起重机吊斗上安设“大牙”，这样就可以不要增加吊桶了。这个合理化建议一直旅行了三个月才被采纳，要到四月份才能投入生产。但是，四月份已经解冻，粘土早已松散，用不着安装“大牙”了。一追查拖延的原因，车间就埋怨总机械师室不重视合理化建议；总机械师室领导人员则埋怨技术科没有说明这项建议的重要性；技术科的人说：我们已经提出了图纸，别的我们不负责。
    在佳木斯机械厂，一件合理化建议从提出到处理，要经过“四大步骤，十个过程”。牡丹江橡胶厂三车间会计员李绍春，提出翻修旧螺丝的建议，可以两年不用外买。但是掌握合理化建议的人要他打两年不买新螺丝的保票，否则不考虑。
    为了鼓励职工们多提合理化建议，以便更快、更多、更好、更省地完成国家计划，每一个企业必须跟积压合理化建议的现象作斗争，改变懒洋洋的工作作风，改变那些束缚群众积极性的“制度”和“手续”。我们要学习齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂和哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂的先进作法。
