    The first Communist Youth League station began construction.
    On March 28th and 29th, a voluntary labor force of over 1,200 young workers, students, and cadres braved the rain on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway line to begin construction of China's first Communist Youth League station. In these two days of labor, they had already leveled half a hilltop and excavated nearly 5,000 cubic meters of earth.
    The Communist Youth League station was initiated by the Nanping Local Working Committee of the Communist Youth League in Fujian Province. The youth's voluntary labor in building this station can save the country 20,000 yuan. Before construction, more than 4,000 Youth League members and youth held a mobilization rally, promising to complete the station before the rainy season.

    第一座共青团车站开始建设
    三月二十八日和二十九日，由一千二百多名青年工人、学生和干部组成的一支义务劳动大军，冒着雨在鹰
  （潭）厦（门）铁路线上开始建设我国的第一座共青团车站。他们在这两天的劳动中已经削平了半个山头，挖低土方近五千立方公尺。
    共青团车站是青年团福建省南平地方工作委员会发起修建的。青年义务劳动建设这座车站，可为国家节省资金二万元。施工前，四千多名青年团员和青年举行了誓师大会，他们保证要在雨季前把这座车站修建完工。
