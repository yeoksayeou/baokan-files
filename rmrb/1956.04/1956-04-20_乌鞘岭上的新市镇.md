    New Town on the Wushaoling Mountain
    Guo Fenxiang
    The train travels westward along the Lanzhou-Wuwei section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, passes through the Wushaoling Grand Tunnel, and then advances in a spiral on the mountain railway. Soon, it arrives at An Yuan Yi, the capital of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County.
    Walking into An Yuan Yi, one can see more than a thousand ethnic-style red houses neatly arranged on both sides of the street. These houses were built after the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was extended to the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County. More than sixty state-owned enterprises and private shops, such as supply and marketing cooperatives, food companies, People's Bank, and department stores, have been established here. Photography studios, watch shops, and tailor shops have appeared in the town for the first time. New buildings of units such as the normal school, cultural center, and health center are also distributed along the newly built street. At the other end of the street is the newly completed Tianzhu Auditorium, which can accommodate 1,200 people. Several movies have been shown here for the people of all ethnic groups in Tianzhu. Tibetan youths who love singing and dancing also often hold parties in the auditorium.
    An Yuan Yi—this remote mountain village that originally had only dozens of households has become a prosperous new town.
    On the street, herdsmen and Tibetan women in gorgeous costumes often pass by riding horses and driving yak herds. After selling the pilose antler, fox fur, wool, and other local and special products they brought from the pastoral areas to the state-owned purchasing stations, they walk into the trading companies or supply and marketing cooperatives to select their favorite and needed daily necessities. The glass cabinets of the trading company display a wide variety of goods, including brightly colored Shanghai-made yarn, dazzling Hangzhou silk, and large quantities of industrial products shipped from coastal cities. Among them, there are more than 300 kinds of Tibetan knives, leather boots, gold-trimmed hats, and other items specially supplied to ethnic minorities.
    After the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was opened to traffic in An Yuan Yi, the prices of nearly a thousand kinds of industrial products on the market decreased by an average of 3.7%, and the prices of individual commodities even decreased by dozens of percentage points. For example, the gold-trimmed dragon bowls favored by Tibetans used to be transported by horse-drawn carts. Due to the high freight costs and high damage rate, a dragon bowl had to be sold for around five yuan. After using trains to transport goods, the price of dragon bowls has dropped to five jiao each. Tibetan people, who originally used wooden bowls to eat buttered tea and zanba, have generally switched to using dragon bowls. With the increase in people's purchasing power, the turnover of trading companies has risen rapidly. Although the number of salespersons has increased five or six times, they still often feel overwhelmed.
    The people of all ethnic groups in Tianzhu also continuously bring local and special products from pastoral and mountainous areas to concentrate here. In the past year, about 10,000 tons of materials have been transported out by train. Medicinal materials such as wulingzhi and huangbai, which had been unsalable for a long time because the freight was more expensive than the cost, have opened up sales channels and tens of thousands of catties have been transported out after the railway was opened. Before the railway was built, yak horns, animal bones, and sheep intestines, which were discarded at will by herdsmen after slaughtering livestock, are now purchased in large quantities by supply and marketing cooperatives and transported to button factories and bone fertilizer factories in various places by train as raw materials or for export needs. The freight for sheep wool and marmot fur, which were already selling well, has also been reduced a lot after using train transportation, and the purchase price has been increased accordingly by 15% to 50%. This has greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of herdsmen. In the past year, Tianzhu herdsmen sold more than 60,000 catties more wool to the An Yuan Yi purchasing station than in the year before the railway was opened, and the number of marmot furs sold to the state has almost doubled. This year, herdsmen will also make extensive use of medicines transported by train to prevent and control infectious diseases of livestock; new-style production tools such as grass mowers and cashmere grabbing tools will also be continuously transported in via the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway.
    After the opening of the railway, the people of all ethnic groups in Tianzhu proposed a plan to increase the number of sheep by more than 60,000 and cattle and horses by 7,500 this year. In addition to deciding to produce more fur to support industrial construction, this year they will also use trains to transport large quantities of cattle and horses to rural areas to meet the needs of agricultural production after the cooperative upsurge.

    乌鞘岭上的新市镇
    郭汾祥
    火车沿着兰新铁路兰州武威段西行，穿过乌鞘岭大隧道后，就在盘山铁路上回旋前进，不久就到了天祝藏族自治县的首府——安远驿。
    走进安远驿，只见街道两旁整齐地排列一千多间民族形式的红色房子，这些房子都是兰新铁路修到天祝藏族自治县后建筑起来的。这里已经建立了供销合作社、食品公司、人民银行、百货商店等六十多家国营企业和私营商店；照相馆、钟表店、缝纫铺等第一次出现在市镇上。在新修的街道旁，还分布着师范学校、文化馆、卫生院等单位的崭新的建筑物。市街的另一端，是完工不久的可以容纳一千二百人的天祝大礼堂，这里已经为天祝各族人民放映了几次电影；喜爱歌舞的藏族青年也经常在大礼堂里举行联欢晚会。
    安远驿——这个原来只有几十户人家的荒僻山村，已经变成了一个繁荣的新市镇。
    在街道上，不时有牧民和穿着绮丽服装的藏族妇女，骑着马，赶着牦牛群经过。他们把从牧区带来的鹿茸、狐皮、羊毛等土产特产品卖给国营收购站后，就走进贸易公司或供销合作社选购心爱的和需要的日用品。贸易公司的玻璃柜里陈列着琳琅满目的商品，有上海制造的鲜艳绒线，光彩夺目的杭州绸缎，以及从沿海各城市运来的大宗工业品，其中光专门供给少数民族的藏刀、皮靴、金边帽等就有三百多种。
    兰新铁路通车到安远驿后，市场上的近千种工业品价格平均下降3.7％，个别商品价格甚至减低了百分之几十。像藏民喜爱的金边龙碗，过去用马车运输，由于运费昂贵，破损率又大，一只龙碗要卖五元上下；利用火车装运货物以后，龙碗的价格已经下降到五角一只。原来用木碗吃酥油?粑的藏族人民，已经普遍改用龙碗。随着人民购买力的提高，贸易公司的营业额迅速上升，虽然营业员人数已经随着增加了五、六倍，还是时常感到忙不过来。
    天祝各族人民也络绎不绝地把牧区和山区出产的土产品和特产品集中到这里来，一年来利用火车外运的物资就有一万吨左右。过去因运费比成本还贵而长期滞销的五灵脂、黄柏等药材，通车后已经打开销路，运出了几十万斤。铁路修通前，牧民们屠宰牲畜后，随手扔掉的牦牛角、兽骨和羊肠等，现在已经由供销合作社大量收购，利用火车运往各地钮扣厂、骨肥厂做原料或供出口需要。过去已经畅销的羊毛和旱獭皮，利用火车运输后运费也降低了很多，收购价格已相应提高了15％到50％，这样就大大刺激了牧民的生产热情。一年来天祝牧民卖给安远驿收购站的羊毛，就比通车前的一年增加了六万多斤，卖给国家的旱獭皮也几乎增加了一倍。今年牧民们还要大量利用由火车运来的药品防治牲畜的传染病；割草机、抓羊绒器具等新式生产工具，也将通过兰新铁路源源运进来。
    在铁路通车后，天祝各族牧民提出今年要增殖六万多头绵羊和七千五百头牛、马的计划。他们除决定要生产更多的皮毛来支援工业建设外，今年还要利用火车把大批的牛、马运到农村去，以满足合作化高潮后农业生产的需要。
