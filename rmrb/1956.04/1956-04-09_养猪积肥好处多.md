Raising Pigs and Accumulating Manure Has Many Benefits

Editor:

    When our Dafanzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongqing County, Hebei Province, was established at the end of 1952, in order to ensure increased production, in addition to mobilizing capable members to raise six sows themselves, everyone also pooled money to buy a sow to be raised collectively in the cooperative. Because more fertilizer was accumulated, although we suffered a disaster here in 1953, the cooperative still had surplus grain to sell. At the same time, these seven sows bred 123 piglets in one year, selling for 627 yuan, which increased the income of the members.

    In the spring of 1954, our cooperative developed from fifteen households to 109 households, and the entire village was basically collectivized. The cooperative then decided to purchase seventy-five "Klang" pigs collectively with funds raised by everyone and government loans. Soon after, we adopted the practice of providing piglets to members' households for self-raising, and under the guidance of the Tianjin Special District Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station, mobilized members to collect a large amount of wild vegetables and cotton leaves to make fermented feed. In this way, not only were more pigs raised, but also the cost of raising pigs was reduced, saving the country a lot of grain.

    The practice of raising pigs and accumulating manure has brought great benefits to our cooperative. In 1954, the cooperative's crops yielded 10% more than the general masses; in addition, 125 fat pigs were sold to the state, and 656 piglets were sold, with a total income of 8,905 yuan, an average increase of seventeen yuan per person in the cooperative. In 1955, the cooperative increased grain production by about 20,000 jin; in addition, 88 fat pigs were sold to the state, and 506 piglets were sold, with a total income of more than 9,000 yuan. The cooperative's annual income from raising pigs can buy about 130,000 jin of coarse grains, enough for all 504 members of the cooperative to eat for seven or eight months. At present, the cooperative collectively raises 33 pigs, and the members raise 270 pigs, a total of 303 pigs. In order to meet the growing needs of urban residents, we plan to develop to 1,000 pigs by 1958.

    养猪积肥好处多编辑同志：
    我们河北省永清县大范庄农业生产合作社在1952年底建立的时候，为了保证增产，除了动员有力量的社员自养六口母猪外，大家还摊钱买了一口母猪在社里伙养。由于肥料积得多了，因此1953年虽然我们这儿遭了灾，社里却还有余粮出卖。同时这七口大母猪一年来繁殖了123口仔猪，卖了627元，使社员增加了收入。
    1954年春，我们社由十五户发展到109户，全村基本上已经合作化了。社里又决定由大家集资和政府贷款，买了七十五口“克郎”猪集体喂养。不久以后，我们由采取了把小猪供给社员各户自养的做法，并且在天津专区畜牧兽医站的指导下，发动社员大量采集野菜、棉叶制作发酵饲料。这样，不但养了更多的猪，而且降低了养猪成本，给国家节约了很多粮食。
    养猪积肥的做法，使我们社里得到了很大的好处。1954年社里的庄稼比一般群众多收一成；另外还卖给国家肥猪125口，出卖仔猪656口，一共收入8，905元，平均全社每人增加收入十七元。1955年社里大约增产了粮食两万斤；另外还卖给国家肥猪八十八口，出售仔猪506口，共收入九千多元。我社全年的养猪收入，可以买粗粮十三万斤左右，足够全社504人吃七、八个月。现在全社伙养猪三十三口，社员养猪270口，共303口。为了满足城市居民日渐增长的需要，我们计划到1958年要发展到一千口猪。
