Should Specifically Help Workers Apply Advanced Experience

To the Editor:

    The workers in our workshop have made a pledge to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years or less. Currently, everyone is enthusiastically learning advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and within our country. However, the leaders of our factory and various sections and offices have not provided specific leadership and necessary support for the work of promoting advanced experiences.

    In our metal cutting workshop, the key to promoting advanced experiences is learning to use various advanced cutting tools. In order to enable workers to learn how to use advanced cutting tools for production, the workshop trade union has conducted multiple publicity campaigns and organized demonstrations. Up to now, approximately 40% of the workers in the entire workshop have mastered the operation methods of seven types of advanced cutting tools, such as high-speed threading, marvelous planing tools, or Chiquilev and Kolesov tools. These cutting tools can be applied to the production of 175 kinds of parts. However, the factory leaders have not taken practical actions to encourage and support the enthusiasm of the workers. From January to March 10th this year, the factory's central tool grinding room only supplied two kinds of advanced cutting tools (namely, powerful internal bore tools and Kolesov turning tools) to the entire workshop, with a quantity of only eight pieces, and the quality was not up to standard. Some turners had to grind their own advanced cutting tools, which wasted a lot of production time every day; more turners could not grind their own tools and had to continue to use ordinary cutting tools for production.

    The factory leaders also do not pay enough attention to rationalization proposals. Our workshop put forward thirty-five proposals in 1955, of which only nine were approved by the factory, while almost all of the other proposals that were not approved by the factory were implemented in the workshop. After the "Liaoning Daily" criticized our factory on February 29th for not paying attention to the rationalization proposals of the masses, the office in charge of handling rationalization proposals has added manpower and immediately approved almost all of the more than forty proposals submitted by our workshop this year. However, nearly half of them were approved and handed over to the workshop for "self-resolution," without providing technical guidance or actively supplying experimental raw materials. As a result, some proposals still cannot be tested after being approved and sent to the workshop.

    I believe that the leaders of our factory and the various sections and offices that directly guide production should quickly improve their work and help workers solve specific problems in learning advanced production experiences and realizing rationalization proposals more, so as to make production better.

    应该具体地帮助工人运用先进经验编辑同志：
    我们车间的职工已经提出了保证，要在四年或更短的时间里完成五年计划。现在，大家正在热情地学习苏联和国内各种先进经验。但是我们工厂的领导人和各科、室，对推广先进经验的工作却没有给以具体的领导和应有的支持。
    在我们金属切削加工车间，推广先进经验的关键是学习运用各式各样的先进刀具。为了使工人学会用先进刀具进行生产，车间工会曾经进行了多次宣传，并且组织了表演。到现在，全车间大约有40％的工人分别掌握了高速挑扣、奇妙刨刀或奇基列夫、科列索夫等七种先进刀具的操作方法。这些刀具可以应用在175种部件的生产中。但是工厂的领导人并没有用实际行动来鼓励和支持工人的热情。从今年一月到三月十日止。厂里的中央磨刀室只供应了全车间两种先进刀具（即强力内孔和科列索夫车刀），数量只有八把，质量也不合规格。有些车工只好自己磨制先进刀具，每天要耽误不少的生产时间；更多的车工自己不会磨刀，只好仍然使用一般刀具来生产。
    工厂领导人对待合理化建议也是不够重视的。我们车间在1955年提出了三十五件建议，其中厂里批准的只有九件，而其他没有被厂里批准的建议在车间里却几乎全部被实现了。今年二月二十九日辽宁日报批评我厂不重视群众的合理化建议以后，处理合理化建议的办公室已经增添了人力，并且立即把我们车间今年提出的四十多件建议几乎全部批审完毕，但是，其中却有将近一半是批交给车间“自行解决”，既不加以技术指导，也不积极供应试验用的原材料。因此，有些建议批到车间以后，仍然不能着手试验。
    我认为，我们工厂的领导人以及直接指导生产的各科、室应该迅速改进工作，更多地帮助工人解决学习先进生产经验和实现合理化建议中的具体问题，以便把生产搞得更好。
