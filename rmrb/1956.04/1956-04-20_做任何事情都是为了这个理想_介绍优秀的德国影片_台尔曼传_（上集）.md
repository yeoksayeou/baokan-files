    "Ernst Thälmann - Leader of His Class," which won the "Peace Prize" at the 8th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, is an outstanding biographical film of global significance. It vividly portrays the brilliant image of Ernst Thälmann, one of the great leaders of the German working class, and profoundly reflects his life's struggles.
    Ernst Thälmann was born in 1886 in a working-class family in Hamburg, Germany. He actively participated in the revolutionary movement from an early age, joined the German Communist Party, and later was elected Chairman of the German Communist Party. In the words of Thälmann's "Last Testament from Prison," he was "first a son of a revolutionary class, and then became its revolutionary leader." The film "Ernst Thälmann - Leader of His Class" (Part 1) is a true record of his struggle from being a son of a revolutionary class to becoming its revolutionary leader.
    The film begins with the German Revolution in November 1918 and the overthrow of the Wilhelm monarchy and ends with the Hamburg Uprising and retreat in 1923. This period was a time of surging revolutionary tides in Germany, and Thälmann advanced with the revolutionary tide and stood at the forefront. He stood closely with the broad masses of the people and led them in fighting the enemy. His "life and work have always known only one thing: for the benefit of the working people of Germany." These circumstances are presented in a generalized and concentrated way in the film. Therefore, from the screen, we not only see the heroic, living Thälmann, but also the great strength of the German working class.
    The film vividly demonstrates Thälmann's strong leadership role in the revolutionary movement from the very beginning. After the German people overthrew Wilhelm II and ended the rule of the Wilhelm monarchy, the political power was unfortunately seized by the right-wing Social Democrat Ebert, who disguised himself as a revolutionary. The shameless Ebert reactionary government assassinated the outstanding leaders of the German working class, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, in 1919, causing serious damage to the revolutionary movement. At this moment, Thälmann, who had led a soldiers' uprising on the front lines, once again stood in front of the workers without hesitation, shouting: "We must swear to Liebknecht and Luxemburg to carry their cause to the end!" The scene of Thälmann speaking to the workers in the film is very moving: Thälmann stands on a high platform and speaks passionately, and the workers listen attentively. From their facial expressions, it can be seen that their hearts have been ignited by Thälmann's words. They really did as Thälmann said, fearing no difficulties and continuing to move forward firmly.
    Thälmann was very good at uniting the masses and striking at the enemy, and we can clearly see this in the film. When the reactionary Kapp putschists overthrew the Ebert government, established the Kapp government, and invaded Hamburg with armed forces, Thälmann immediately exposed the conspiracy of the Kapp government, making the working masses realize its counter-revolutionary true face. He called on the workers to rise up and fight the Kapp armed forces, encouraging them to persevere and not to relax. Under his leadership, the workers finally crushed the Kapp armed forces. When the German people, especially the workers, were under the dual oppression of the Treaty of Versailles and domestic monopoly capital, and were seriously threatened by hunger, the Soviet Union transported a large amount of grain to them. However, the reactionary authorities used methods such as refusing to unload the goods and refusing to rent warehouses to prevent people from accepting the Soviet gift. At this time, Thälmann mobilized the people to unload the goods, rented dance halls as warehouses, and finally broke through the many obstacles and distributed the grain to the people.
    The film highlights Thälmann's outstanding organizational skills through the armed uprising of the Hamburg workers. As can be seen from the film, the historical background of the Hamburg workers' armed uprising during the battle was as follows: due to the French occupation of the Ruhr area, as well as the policies of Stinnes and other speculators that caused inflation, the German economy continued to deteriorate. By 1923, Germany had fallen into unimaginable difficulties, and the people were generally suffering from poverty and unemployment. In order to eliminate hunger and find a way out of the crisis, the Hamburg workers, under the leadership of Thälmann, took action. From mobilizing the workers to seize enemy weapons and attack the enemy, Thälmann was always in command. And when the opportunist leading group of the German Communist Party, Brandler and his gang, prevented the expansion of the armed struggle to the whole of Germany, thus isolating Hamburg, he implemented a planned and organized retreat in order to prevent the workers from fighting alone. Of course, the retreat was not a defeat, the workers did not succumb, and in order to build a better Germany, they would continue to fight with their most beloved Thälmann.
    Thälmann was always faithful to the great socialist ideal, and he "did everything for this ideal" (see Thälmann's "Last Testament from Prison"). The film "Ernst Thälmann - Leader of His Class," in expressing Thälmann's noble spiritual qualities and portraying this complex historical background, does not resort to detached and tedious preaching, but rather expresses it through vivid artistic images, so it can move people; at the same time, the actors' moving performances also enhance the film's artistic power. The performances of every actor who created a typical German worker can capture the hearts of the audience; especially the acting skills of the actor playing Thälmann have their own unique qualities. His performance is simple, authentic, and gradually deepens with the development of the plot, so that the image of the character in the play can vividly appear on the screen, giving people a very real feeling. And the theme of the film is therefore better elaborated and developed.

    “做任何事情都是为了这个理想”
    ——介绍优秀的德国影片“台尔曼传”（上集）

    在第八届卡罗维·发利国际电影节上获得“和平奖”的“台尔曼传”，是一部具有世界意义的杰出的传记片。它生动地塑造了德国工人阶级伟大领袖之一的台尔曼的光辉形象，深刻地反映了他的一生斗争事迹。
    恩斯特·台尔曼在1886年出生于德国汉堡的一个工人阶级家庭，早年就积极参加革命运动，加入了德国共产党，后来当选为德国共产党主席。用“台尔曼狱中遗书”里的话来说，他“最初是一个革命阶级的儿子，随后便成为它的革命领袖”。而影片“台尔曼传”（上集），正是他从一个革命阶级的儿子成为它的革命领袖的斗争的真实纪录。
    影片内容以1918年11月德国革命和推翻威廉皇朝开始，以1923年汉堡暴动和撤退为结束。这个时期是德国革命浪潮奔腾澎湃的时期，台尔曼随着革命浪潮前进而且屹立在浪潮的最前列。他紧紧地跟广大人民站在一起，并且领导着他们跟敌人作斗争。他的“生命和工作从来只知道一件事，那就是：为了劳动的德国人民的利益”。这些情况在影片里面得到了概括的、集中的表现，因此，从银幕上我们不仅看到了英雄的、活生生的台尔曼，而且也看到了德国工人阶级的伟大力量。
    影片一开始就鲜明地显示了台尔曼在革命运动中的坚强的领导作用。德国人民打倒了威廉第二，结束了威廉皇朝的统治以后，政权却不幸为伪装革命的社会民主党右派艾伯特所攫取。无耻的艾伯特反动政府在1919年暗杀了德国工人阶级的杰出领袖李卜克内西和卢森堡，使革命运动受到严重的损失。就在这时候，曾经在前线上领导过士兵起义的台尔曼，又毫不犹豫地站在工人前面高呼：“我们要向李卜克内西和卢森堡宣誓，把他们的事业进行到底！”影片里面台尔曼向工人讲话的场面是很动人的：台尔曼站在高台上激动地讲话，工人们专心地听着。从他们面部表情上看得出来，他们的心已经被台尔曼的话燃烧起来了。他们真的照台尔曼的话做了，不怕任何困难，坚强地继续前进。
    台尔曼是非常善于团结群众，打击敌人的，从影片里面我们也可以清晰地看到这一点。当反动的卡仆匪徒推翻了艾伯特政府，建立了卡仆政府，并且用武装进袭汉堡的时候，台尔曼立刻揭露了卡仆政府的阴谋，使工人群众认识到它的反革命的真面目。他号召工人们起来和卡仆武装战斗，鼓励他们坚持下去，不要松劲。在他的领导下，工人们终于粉碎了卡仆武装。当德国人民，特别是工人在凡尔赛和约和国内垄断资本的双重压迫下，受着饥饿的严重的威胁的时候，苏联给他们运来了大批粮食。但是反动当局却用拒绝卸货、拒绝出租仓库等方法来阻止人们接受苏联的礼物。这时候，台尔曼就发动人民卸货，把跳舞厅租来作仓库，最后终于打破了重重阻挠，把粮食发给了人民。
    影片通过汉堡工人的武装起义，突出地表现了台尔曼的卓越的组织才能。从影片里面可以看到，在战斗过程中，汉堡工人的武装起义的历史背景是这样的：由于法军的占领鲁尔区，以及斯汀纳和其它投机分子的政策而引起的通货膨胀，德国经济不断恶化，到了1923年，德国陷入了难以想像的困境，人民普遍遭受着贫困和失业的痛苦。为了消灭饥饿现象和从危机中打开出路，在台尔曼的领导下，汉堡工人行动起来了。从动员工人群众到夺取敌人武器以至进攻敌人，台尔曼都是指挥若定的。而当德国共产党的机会主义领导集团布兰德列尔和他的一帮阻止把武装斗争扩大到全德国，因而使汉堡陷于孤立的时候，为了使工人避免孤军作战，他又实行有计划、有组织的撤退。当然，撤退并不是失败，工人并没有屈服，为着建立一个美好的德国，他们还要跟着自己最热爱的台尔曼继续战斗。
    台尔曼始终忠实于伟大的社会主义理想，他“做任何事情都是为了这个理想”（见“台尔曼狱中遗书”）。影片“台尔曼传”在表现台尔曼这种崇高的精神品质、表现这一段复杂的历史背景的时候，不是脱离生活的、枯燥的说教，而是通过鲜明的艺术形象来表现的，因此它能够感动人；而同时，演员们的动人的表演也增强了影片的艺术力量。每一个创造德国工人典型的演员的表演，都能够抓住观众的心；特别是扮演台尔曼的演员的演技，更有其独到之处。他的表演是素朴的，真实的，并且随着剧情的发展，逐渐深化，使剧中人物的形象得以鲜明地出现在银幕上，给人以极真实的感觉。而影片的主题思想也因此得到了更好的阐述和发挥。
