Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: According to a TASS dispatch from "Mirny Station" in Antarctica on the 14th: One hundred days have passed since the Soviet Antarctic Expedition's diesel-electric ship "Ob" arrived at the Antarctic coast with the first group of expedition members. During this period, the Soviet research staff, disregarding the harsh climatic conditions, established a scientific town with more than twenty buildings on the desolate "Truth Coast." A power station ensures the village has electricity. A powerful radio station has established communication between "Mirny Station" and the Soviet Union, French and Australian Antarctic bases, and other locations around the world. Wireless telephone communication with Moscow has also been successfully tested.

During this period, Soviet scientists have conducted explorations that are of great interest to the scientific community. They have made many flights over the vast area of the East Antarctic coast, east and west of "Mirny Station," and their flights have also penetrated deep into the Antarctic continent – towards the South Geomagnetic Pole and areas near the difficult-to-reach polar regions.

The Antarctic expedition team, led by Captain Somov, has also been marching inland for two weeks since beginning their first penetration of the continent under extremely harsh climatic conditions. On the 11th, a plane from "Mirny Station" flew 150 kilometers against the wind to meet with the expedition team. These explorers, preparing to establish a relay station leading to the South Geomagnetic Pole region, collected valuable data on the movement of air masses over the Antarctic continent while battling blizzards along the way. From 50 kilometers inland from the coast, they observed an unusual phenomenon on the ice-covered plateau: the temperature of the air increases with altitude.

    在“真理海岸”一百天
    苏联考察队逐步深入南极大陆
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社记者十四日从南极“和平村”报道：从苏联南极考察队的“鄂毕号”柴油电动船载着第一批考察人员到达南极海岸的时候起，已经过去一百天了。苏联的考察工作人员在这段期间不顾恶劣的气候条件，在一片荒凉的“真理海岸”上建立了有二十多座建筑物的科学镇。发电站保证了全村的用电。强大的无线电台使“和平村”同苏联，同法国和澳大利亚的南极基地以及全世界其他地点建立了联系。同莫斯科的无线电话联系也试验成功了。
    苏联科学家在这期间进行了对科学界有很大兴趣的考察工作。他们在“和平村”以东和以西的东南极海岸这一辽阔的地区内作了许多次飞行，他们的飞行也深入南极大陆——南地磁极和靠近难于接近的极地的地方。
    由队长索莫夫率领的南极探险队，自从在极恶劣的气候条件下开始第一次深入大陆的进军以来，也有两个星期了。十一日，“和平村”的飞机逆风飞到一百五十公里的地方和探险队人员会见。这批准备建立通向南地磁极区的中途站的考察人员，沿途在同暴风雪搏斗的同时，收集了许多关于南极大陆的气团流动的有价值的资料。从离海岸五十公里起一直深入内地，他们观察到在冰封的高原上有一种异乎寻常的现象：空气的温度随着高度而升高。
