Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th dispatch: The Japanese government held a joint meeting of various ministries on the 10th and decided not to accept the triangular trade proposal put forward by the United States during the 1955-1956 U.S. fiscal year.

The triangular trade plan was proposed to Yukawa Morio, director of the Economic Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by Walling, counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, in late February this year. The plan stipulates that the United States will export surplus agricultural products to Japan and pay in Japanese yen. This amount of Japanese yen will be used to purchase goods from Japan for Southeast Asian countries that accept U.S. "aid." Japanese government officials said that the United States drafted this plan because Southeast Asian countries are unwilling to buy U.S. surplus agricultural products.

Officials from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry believe that this U.S. plan will mean oppression of Japanese agriculture. They said that there is currently no good reason to accept this U.S. proposal. According to Kyodo News, the Japanese Ministry of Transportation is firmly opposed to the U.S. plan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Economic Planning Agency have also expressed very cold attitudes towards the plan. They believe that the stipulation that U.S. ships carry more than 50% of the goods will cause great adverse effects on the Japanese shipping industry, and they also believe that this U.S. triangular trade plan will hinder Japan's general exports.

    日政府拒绝美国三角贸易计划
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本政府在十日举行各省（部）联席会议，决定在1955—1956美国会计年度内暂不接受美国提出的三角贸易的建议。
    三角贸易计划是今年二月下旬美国驻东京大使馆参赞华林向日本外务省经济局长汤川盛夫提出的。计划规定，美国向日本输出剩余农产品，用日圆付款，这笔日圆款项将给接受美国“援助”的东南亚国家从日本购买货物。日本政府人士说，美国拟制这个计划是因为东南亚国家不愿意买美国的剩余农产品。
    日本农林省的官员认为，美国这个计划将意味着对日本农业的压迫。他们说，目前没有任何好的理由来接受美国的这个建议。据共同社报道，日本运输省坚决反对美国这个计划，外务省、大藏省和经济企划厅等部门对这个计划也都表示非常冷淡的态度。他们认为，计划规定用美国船只载运50％以上货物的比例将使日本航运业遭受很大的不利影响，并且认为美国这个三角贸易计划将使日本的一般出口遭受妨碍。
