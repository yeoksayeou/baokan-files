Several Issues Concerning Expanding the Multiple Cropping Area
Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture Director Zhang Shirong

Prior to 1953, the area of idle land in Anhui Province during the summer, autumn, and winter seasons was very large. Since the Anhui Provincial Party Committee put forward three reforms in agricultural production, the above situation has changed. The first of the three reforms is to increase the proportion of summer harvests, increase the planting of a season of late autumn crops, and promote a three-crop-a-year continuous cropping system. In addition to its significant role in avoiding disasters and ensuring harvests, this method has another role, which is to expand the multiple cropping area by utilizing favorable natural conditions. In 1953, the province's multiple cropping index was 148.1%, and by 1956 it had expanded to 194.5%. In 1955, the area with three crops a year reached 11.4 million mu, the area with two crops a year was 60 million mu, and the area with one crop a year was only over 19 million mu. Since 1954, expanding the multiple cropping area has increased grain production by 9 billion jin.

Based on Anhui Province's experience over the past few years, we believe that the following issues must be addressed in the work of expanding the multiple cropping area.

First, it is necessary to study the climate conditions and select suitable crops. The annual average temperature in Anhui Province is around 16 degrees Celsius, and the frost-free period is generally 240 days. Among the crops in Anhui Province, there is wheat with a growing period of 240 days, spring crops such as spring potatoes and spring corn with about 90 days from spring planting to summer harvest, early autumn crops such as sorghum and early rice with 90-120 days, mid-autumn crops such as mid-season rice and soybeans with about 130 days, and late autumn crops such as late rice, velvet beans, buckwheat, and late corn with 60-90 days. Generally, summer harvest crops are harvested around the beginning of summer, early and mid-autumn crops are harvested from the Great Heat to the beginning of autumn, and from the Great Heat and the beginning of autumn to the beginning of the first frost (around ten days after the Frost's Descent), there are still 70-90 days, which is enough for the growth of late autumn crops. For example, early rice is sown before the Qingming Festival, transplanted around the beginning of summer, and harvested around the Great Heat; late rice is sown around the summer solstice, transplanted around the Great Heat, and harvested around the Frost's Descent, followed by planting rapeseed or early barley. Another example is that early rice is harvested around the Great Heat, followed by planting late corn, and after harvesting corn after the Frost's Descent, rapeseed is planted. According to the climate conditions, selecting suitable crops according to local conditions can expand the multiple cropping area.

Second, it is necessary to pay attention to solving the conflicts in the crop rotation schedule. Because crops have a certain growing season; delaying the season will affect the harvest and affect the next season's production. As the masses say: Delaying one season delays seven seasons. Our solution to this problem is:

(1) Make unified arrangements for the entire year's production. For example, fields that are converted to double-cropping rice cannot be planted with wheat, otherwise, the wheat will affect the transplanting of early rice; the land sown with spring potatoes cannot be sown with wheat in the previous season. This requires land arrangement, and the annual planting plan is arranged according to different soil quality, water sources, and crop varieties. Our general plan is: in areas with sufficient water sources, promote the "two-rice-one-dry" rotation system, that is, after the double-cropping rice is harvested, the third season is planted with rapeseed or early barley. In areas with insufficient water sources, implement "two-dry-one-rice," that is, in areas prone to autumn drought, carry out early rice intercropping with late corn, rapeseed, or early-maturing summer harvest crops. In areas prone to spring drought, carry out late rice intercropping with wheat, spring corn. In dry grain areas, adopt wheat intercropping with sorghum (or soybeans), late autumn crops, or spring corn, spring potatoes intercropping with late autumn crops, early-maturing summer harvest crops.

(2) Take measures such as variety adjustment, seedling transplanting, and intercropping in the field to adjust the crop rotation schedule. The so-called variety adjustment is to select early-maturing and high-yielding varieties. For example, in terms of planting double-cropping rice, early rice should use varieties such as "Liushizi," "Wushizi," "Nante No.," and "503." These varieties are generally harvested around the Great Heat, which does not delay the sowing period of late rice. Last year, individual areas selected the "One Season Early" variety. Because the harvest was later, late rice could not be transplanted and was changed to dry grain. In order to increase the planting of late autumn crops, it is even more necessary to select varieties with high yields and short maturity periods such as "Fu Jiao Corn" and "Xiao Dong Rice," which can not only obtain high yields but also not delay autumn sowing. Even in areas with a shorter frost-free period, variety adjustment can also be used to expand the multiple cropping area. Last year, the Gaogong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiuning County in the mountainous area of southern Anhui selected the "503" rice variety for early rice planting (field growth period of 83 days); "Xiao Dong Rice" was used for late rice planting (field growth period of 84 days), with an average harvest of 833 jin per mu, which was 319 jin more than one season of mid-season rice. The growing period of double-cropping rice is a total of 167 days, and late rice can be harvested before the first frost.

Transplanting seedlings means nurturing seedlings in advance and transplanting them after the previous season's crops are harvested to free up land. For example, if late rice is harvested around the Frost's Descent, the time for planting rapeseed is already too late. You can nurture the rapeseed seedlings before harvesting late rice, and transplant them after preparing the land after harvesting late rice. If sorghum, corn, cotton, etc. are too late to sow before the summer harvest crops are harvested, seedlings can also be transplanted. Transplanted seedlings can ensure strong and full seedlings, and the yield is also high. The "Fu Jiao Corn" transplanted by Yangshu, Tongxing and other agricultural cooperatives in Tongcheng County was harvested eight days earlier than direct seeding, with an extra 20 jin per mu.

Intercropping in the field means using the row spacing of the previous season's crops to intercrop the next season's crops to save time and catch up with the season. For example, intercropping spring corn in spring potato fields; intercropping sorghum and cotton in wheat fields and potato fields; intercropping velvet beans in mid-season rice fields, etc.

(3) Harvest and plant in a timely manner without delaying the farming season. This will ensure the yield and will not affect the sowing of the next season's crops. There is a saying in the countryside: "It is better to be seven days early before autumn than one day late after autumn." This precisely illustrates the importance of not delaying the farming season. Last year, in individual areas, early rice was soaked after the Qingming Festival, transplanted during the Grain Full, and harvested after the Beginning of Autumn, which affected the transplanting of late rice. Although late corn was changed to be planted in time, the yield was not as high as late rice. According to the climatic conditions of Anhui Province and the experience of the masses, early rice should generally be soaked before the Qingming Festival and transplanted around the Beginning of Summer; spring potatoes should be sown around the Awakening of Insects; late autumn crops, except for late rice, which should be transplanted around the Great Heat, should be sown around the End of Heat. In order to cultivate and plant in a timely manner, in the harvest and sowing season, it is necessary to arrange labor and animal power according to the amount of farm work required by the upper and lower season crops, and divide the labor and animal power into several shifts to ensure that the front harvests rice, and the back plows the fields, spreads manure, and transplants seedlings. In the crop growing season, it is necessary to strengthen field management in a planned way to promote early maturity of crops.

Third, it is necessary to solve the two problems of fertilizer and water conservancy. On the issue of fertilizer, in recent years, farmers have created a method of intercropping green manure, that is, intercropping a season of green manure crops in fields of nearly mature crops to press the green as fertilizer. For example, farmers on both sides of the Huai River intercrop sesame, mung beans, indigo, etc. to be used as the base fertilizer for late autumn crops when sorghum is about to mature; farmers along the Yangtze River intercrop red clover, velvet beans, etc. in summer harvest crop fields to be used as fertilizer for rice. According to experiments, intercropping 12 jin of mung beans per mu of sorghum land can harvest more than 1,600 jin of fresh grass, with a nitrogen content of about 11 or 12 jin, equivalent to the nitrogen content of 180 jin of bean cake. Pressing green manure not only solves the fertilizer problem, but also increases the organic matter in the soil and cultivates the soil fertility. In addition, methods such as mixing peas and wheat, mixing seeds with rhizobia, and planting wild locusts, purple spike locusts and other green manure crops on wasteland and ditches are all good ways to solve the fertilizer problem. On the issue of water conservancy, it is necessary to build more ponds and dams, dig more ditches and canals, build more valley workshops, and dig more wells. These small-scale projects can not only store water for drought prevention, but also drain floods and prevent waterlogging. In hilly areas, ponds and dams are small and few, and large-scale water conservancy projects cannot be built. However, farmers in these areas have also created a method of making "water storage ponds," that is, selecting suitable high-altitude fields, raising the field ridges to store more rainwater, to supply water for sowing summer harvest crops. One mu of "water storage pond" can supply water for three or four mu of paddy fields. Last year, the Yaogong Agricultural Cooperative in Feixi County reserved one-third of the paddy fields to store water, and two-thirds of the paddy fields were planted with summer harvest crops. This method is worth promoting vigorously in the current situation.

    扩大复种面积的几个问题
    安徽省农业厅长　张世荣
    1953年以前，安徽省每年夏、秋、冬三季的休闲地面积很大。自从安徽省委提出了农业生产的三项改革以后，上述情况有了改变。三项改革的第一项是：提高夏季收成比重，增种一季晚秋作物，推行一年三熟的连作制。这项办法除了有避灾保收的重大作用外，还有另一种作用，就是利用有利的自然条件扩大复种面积。1953年全省复种指数是148.1％，到1956年已经扩大到194.5％。1955年，一年三熟的面积已经达1，140万亩，一年两熟的是六千万亩，一年一熟的只有一千九百多万亩。从1954年以来，因为扩大复种面积增产了九十亿斤粮食。
    根据安徽省几年来的经验，我们认为在扩大复种面积的工作中，必须要注意解决以下几个问题。
    第一，要研究气候条件，选种适宜的作物。安徽省年平均温度在摄氏十六度左右，无霜期一般是240天。安徽省的农作物中，有生长期240天的小麦，有九十天左右的春马铃薯、春玉米等春种夏收作物，有90—120天的高粱、早稻等早秋作物，有130天左右的中稻、大豆等中秋作物，有60—90天的晚稻、泥豆、荞麦、晚玉米等晚秋作物。一般夏收作物在立夏边收获，早秋和中秋作物在大暑到立秋收获，而大暑、立秋到初霜期开始（约在霜降后十天左右），仍有70—90天，足够晚秋作物生长的需要。例如，早稻在清明前播种，立夏边栽秧，大暑边收割，晚稻在夏至边播种，大暑边栽秧，霜降边收割，以后再种油菜或早大麦。又如，早稻在大暑边收割，接种晚玉米，霜降后收获玉米后再种油菜。根据气候条件，因地制宜地选种适宜的农作物，就可以扩大复种面积。
    第二，要注意解决农作物的茬口矛盾。因为农作物都有一定的生长季节；贻误季节，就会影响收成，影响下一季生产。正如群众所说：迟了一季，误了七季。我们解决这个问题的办法是：
    （一）统一做好全年的生产安排。比如，改种双季稻的田，就不能种小麦，否则，小麦就会影响早稻的栽秧；播种春马铃薯的地，也不能在前季播种小麦。这就需要进行土地排队，按照不同的土质、水源和作物品种，安排全年的播种计划。我们的大体规划是：在水源充足的地区，推广“两水一旱”的轮作制，就是双季稻收获后，第三季种植油菜或早大麦。在水源不足的地区，推行“两旱一水”，就是在容易发生秋旱的地方进行早稻同晚玉米、油菜或早熟夏收作物连作。在容易发生春旱的地方，进行晚稻同小麦、春玉米连作。在旱粮地区，采取小麦同高粱（或大豆）、晚秋作物连作，或是春玉米、春马铃薯同晚秋作物、早熟夏收作物连作。
    （二）采取品种调剂、育苗移栽和田间套种的办法，来调整轮作中的茬口。所谓品种调剂，就是选用早熟高产的品种。如在种双季稻方面，种早稻要采用“六十子”、“五十子”、“南特号”和“503”等品种，这些品种一般在大暑前后收割，不误晚稻的播种期。去年个别地区选用了“一季早”品种，因为收获较迟，晚稻没能栽上而改种了旱粮。为了增种晚秋作物，更要选择产量高，成熟期短的“伏脚玉米”、“小冬稻”等品种，既能得到高产，又不误秋种。就是在无霜期较短的地区，也可以运用品种调剂，扩大复种面积。去年皖南山区休宁县的高公农业生产合作社，种早稻选用“503”稻种（大田生长期为八十三天）；种晚稻采用“小冬稻”（大田生长期为八十四天），平均每亩收获833斤，比一季中稻多收319斤。双季稻的生长期共为167天，在初霜之前就可收割晚稻。
    育苗移栽，就是事先育好苗，等上季作物收获后腾出土地移栽。如晚稻在霜降边收割，种油菜的时间已经过迟，就可以在晚稻收割前把油菜苗育好，在收晚稻后整地移栽。如果夏收作物收割前，高粱、玉米、棉花等来不及播种，也可以育苗移栽。移栽的禾苗能够壮苗全苗，产量也高。桐城县杨树、同兴等农业合作社移栽的“伏脚玉米”，比点种的提早八天收割，每亩多收二十斤。
    田间套种，就是利用上季作物的行间空隙，把下季庄稼套种下去，以争取时间，赶上季节。如在春马铃薯地里套种春玉米；小麦地、马铃薯地里套种高粱、棉花；中稻田里套种泥豆等。
    （三）要适时抢收抢种，不误农时。这样才能保证产量，又不影响下一季作物的播种。农村中有一句谚语：“宁肯秋前差七天，不肯秋后差一天。”这正说明了不误农时的重要。去年个别地区的早稻在清明后才泡种，小满栽秧，立秋后才收割，影响了晚稻栽秧，虽然及时改种了晚玉米，但是产量不及晚稻高。根据安徽省的气候条件和群众的经验，早稻一般要在清明前泡种，立夏前后栽秧；春马铃薯要在惊蛰前后下种；晚秋作物除晚稻要在大暑前后栽秧外，其他都要在处暑前后下种。为了适时耕种，在收割和播种的季节里，要根据上下季作物需要的农活数量，进行劳力、畜力排队，把劳力、畜力分成几班子，做到前面割稻，后面犁田、撒粪、栽秧。在作物生长的季节里，要有计划地加强田间管理，促进作物早熟。
    第三，要解决肥料和水利两个问题。在肥料问题上，几年来农民创造了套种绿肥的办法，就是在接近成熟的庄稼地里套种一季绿肥作物来压青做肥料。如淮河两岸的农民在高粱快成熟的时候，套种芝麻、绿豆、蓝靛等做晚秋作物的基肥；沿江一带的农民在夏收作物田里套种红花草、泥豆等做水稻的肥料。根据试验，每亩高粱地套种十二斤绿豆，可收鲜草一千六百多斤，含氮量约十一、二斤，相当于一百八十斤豆饼的含氮量。压绿肥不但解决了肥料，而且也增加土壤的有机质，培养了地力。除此以外，如豌豆和麦混种，采用根瘤菌拌种，利用荒地、沟渠种植野槐、紫穗槐以及其他绿肥作物，都是解决肥料的好办法。在水利问题上，需要多做塘坝，多挖沟洫，多修谷坊，多打水井。这些小型工程不但能够蓄水防旱，而且能够排洪和防涝。丘陵地带，塘坝小而少，又不能兴修较大的水利工程。但是这类地区的农民也创造了做“水囤子”的办法，就是选择适当的高冲田，加高田埂多蓄雨水，以供给播种夏收作物田的用水。一亩“水囤子”可供给三、四亩水田的用水。去年肥西县姚公农业合作社，就留出三分之一的水田来蓄水，三分之二的水田都种上了夏收作物。这种办法在目前情况下，是值得大力推广的。
