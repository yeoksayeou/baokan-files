    Korean People Welcome the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea
    By Piao Mao, Deputy Chief Editor of "Rodong Sinmun," Korea
    The Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, to be convened in the latter half of this month, will be an important political event in the history of the Workers' Party of Korea and in the lives of the Korean people.
    The news of the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea has encouraged all party members and workers who are striving for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the construction of a socialist foundation in the northern half of the Republic, and has further increased their enthusiasm for labor and politics.
    Now, in any enterprise and construction site in our country, there are eye-catching banners that read "Greet the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea with high labor achievements!" This slogan truly reflects the actual struggle of our country's workers. The broad masses of working people will turn this slogan into a material force with their creativity and enthusiasm.
    It has been eight years since the Second Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea was held. During this period, the Party's line has been consistently and effectively implemented. This line and task is to build the foundation for the reunification of the fatherland—a revolutionary democratic base—and to strengthen the revolutionary democratic base politically, economically, and militarily in order to strive for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The victory of the Party's line has brought about tremendous changes in the lives of the Korean people.
    The Korean people have made great achievements in democratic construction in the northern half, created their own glorious motherland—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, defeated the armed aggression of the American aggressors, and defended the independence and freedom of the motherland. Now, our people are working hard to heal the wounds of war, restore and develop the economy and culture, and establish a socialist foundation in the northern half of the Republic; on the other hand, they are fighting for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and lasting world peace.
    Due to the aggressive crimes of the American imperialists, Korea has suffered extremely serious damage. After the armistice, the working people of our country have achieved proud results in restoring and developing the national economy. In 1955, the total output value of state-owned and cooperative industries in our country reached 156% of the pre-war level, while the machinery and metal processing industry reached 3.4 times the pre-war level, and the textile industry reached 2.6 times the pre-war level. With the assistance of the people of the fraternal countries, headed by the great Soviet Union, we already have many powerful machine factories that directly manufacture various machine tools such as lathes and friction presses. Our industry has not only greatly exceeded the pre-war level in terms of output indicators, but has also undergone fundamental changes in scale and technical equipment.
    Our country's rural economy has also undergone tremendous changes. The broad masses of peasants have gotten rid of the poverty left over from history and embarked on the road to a prosperous life—the road to socialism. As of January 1 this year, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives has reached 12,132, and the number of farmers participating in cooperatives accounts for 49% of the total number of farmers in the country, and the cultivated land area of the cooperatives accounts for 48% of the total cultivated land area. Farmers who have personally experienced the superiority of the cooperative economy are launching a movement to organize agricultural producers' cooperatives with great enthusiasm, which has become the basic feature of our rural life today.
    All these victories and achievements have been achieved under the wise leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, and are the concrete manifestation of the correctness of the Party's policy in practical life. Our people are closely united around the Workers' Party and are fighting for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the establishment of a socialist foundation in the northern half. All the Korean people infinitely trust and love the Workers' Party that leads them from victory to victory, and greet the Third Congress of the Party with high labor enthusiasm.
    Last December, after receiving the news that the Party was to convene its Third Congress, the workers of Pyongyang City held a meeting to pass a resolution to greet the Congress with high labor achievements, and issued a proposal to workers across the country to overfulfill the 1956 national economic plan. This initiative of the workers in the democratic capital immediately aroused widespread response. The workers of factories and mines such as the Sup'ung Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Ch'ongjin Steel Works, the Kogonwon Coal Mine, the Pyongyang Rubber Factory, and the Changgyo Business Office of the P'yongnam Irrigation Project Construction Company actively responded to the initiative of the workers of Pyongyang City, took the lead in launching the production increase competition, and each launched a production increase competition to the workers in the same industry.
    The workers of the Ch'ongjin Steel Works, who proposed a production increase competition to iron and steel workers across the country, passed a solemn resolution: to mobilize and discover all the potential forces within the factory, and complete all the production assigned by the three-year plan before April 15, 1956. The workers of the Hwanghae Iron Works, who responded to this initiative, have already entered the struggle to shorten ironmaking time and increase ironmaking volume. The ironmaking workers of the "Korean-Soviet Friendship" open-hearth furnace have already achieved their first success: they have shortened the ironmaking time by two hours and increased the iron output by ten tons, and have overfulfilled the January steel ingot production plan by 21%.
    The Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, which was severely damaged in the war of aggression launched by American imperialism, is now supplying large quantities of chemical fertilizers to the countryside. In order to restore the annual output of 60,000 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer, the factory's workers have launched a lively competition.
    The workers in the railway department launched a production increase competition movement for safe driving and increased traction. The locomotive drivers of the Hichon Locomotive Depot, who won two victories in the struggle for safe driving for 100,000 kilometers last year, will complete the gift to be presented to the Party Congress—200,000 kilometers of safe driving—before May Day. In the first week of the year, they increased the traction of goods by 10% compared to the original plan, and are now continuing to expand their labor achievements.
    On February 8, our workers received another heartening piece of news. The workers of the new machinery factory belonging to Comrade Choe Chang-seop, which is of great significance to the development of our country's machinery industry, have exerted their wisdom in assembling modern machines, overcome various difficulties, and put the entire factory into production ahead of schedule.
    The main features of the labor competition launched by our people to welcome the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea are the improvement of labor productivity, especially the creative enthusiasm for saving labor. The labor force problem is one of the most acute problems in the restoration and construction of our national economy after the armistice. Due to the lack of labor force, the Party called on the working people to fight for saving labor, especially to improve the degree of mechanization. The working people clearly understand that the significance of mechanization lies not only in saving labor, but also in eliminating the backwardness of our country's economy left over from history. Mechanization is the basic way to improve labor productivity.
    Our working people are answering the Party's call with practical struggle achievements under the slogan of "Work in a way that is worthy of being a builder of socialism." The workers in the machinery industry sector have started producing various advanced construction machinery such as cranes this year, with good results. The construction sector is vigorously promoting the standardization of design, the industrialization of building materials production, and the factoryization of construction.
    From the end of last year to the end of January this year, the light industry sector adopted 1,531 workers' inventions in production, which is more than the inventions in the entire year of last year. This has created conditions for the light industry sector to save 3,000 workers.
    Our countryside has widely set off a labor upsurge in winter. The broad masses of working people are building more than 370 large-scale irrigation projects, including the large-scale P'yongnam Irrigation Project, which has never been seen in the history of our country. Thanks to the labor competition launched by the workers and peasants participating in the construction in the freezing weather, this huge water conservancy project will be completed ahead of schedule before April 25.
    In addition, the work of expanding and improving land is also very active. The members of agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places are effectively carrying out the work of restoring cultivated wasteland, reclaiming virgin land, and transporting soil with united efforts, which was unimaginable during individual farming.
    Our writers and artists are all welcoming the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea with their creative achievements. Several poems and novels dedicated to the Party Congress are already being published. The theaters are busy preparing for performances.
    Our people, who are entering the last year of the post-war three-year plan for the restoration and development of the national economy, are welcoming the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, which will present new victories, with great pride and excitement.
    The achievements of the recently held 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have greatly encouraged our people and made us more determined in our confidence in the victory of the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.
    Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the Korean people are fighting resolutely with full confidence for the construction of a socialist foundation in the northern half of the Republic, for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and for the defense of peace in the Far East and the world.

    朝鲜人民迎接朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”副主笔　朴茂
    朝鲜劳动党将于本月下半月召开第三次代表大会，这将在朝鲜劳动党的历史上和朝鲜人民的生活上成为重要的政治事件。
    朝鲜劳动党召开第三次代表大会的消息，鼓舞了为祖国的和平统一和在共和国北半部建设社会主义基础而奋斗的全体党员和工人，更加提高了他们的劳动热情和政治热情。
    现在在我国的任何一个企业和建设工地，都有引人注目的写着“以高度的劳动成就迎接朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会！”的标语旗。这条标语真实地反映着我国工人们的现实斗争。广大劳动群众将以自己的创造性和热情，使这个口号变成物质的力量。
    从朝鲜劳动党第二次代表大会召开以来，到现在已经八年了。在这段期间内，劳动党的路线得到始终一贯的和有效的执行，这个路线和任务就是：建设祖国统一的基础——革命的民主基地，并从政治上、经济上、军事上加强革命的民主基地，以争取祖国和平统一。党的路线的胜利，使朝鲜人民的生活发生了巨大的变化。
    朝鲜人民在北半部进行的民主建设获得了巨大成就，创建了自己的光荣祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，击溃了美国侵略者的武装侵略，捍卫了祖国的独立和自由。现在，我国人民一方面在努力医治战争创伤、恢复和发展经济、文化事业，以在共和国北半部建立社会主义基础；另一方面，正为争取祖国的和平统一和世界持久和平而奋斗。
    由于美帝国主义者的侵略罪行，朝鲜遭到了极其严重的破坏。我国劳动人民在停战以后，在恢复和发展祖国经济上，获得了可以自豪的成果。在1955年，我国的国营和合作社营工业总产量已达到战前水平的156％，而机械金属加工业则达到战前水平的三点四倍，纺织工业达到两点六倍。在以伟大的苏联为首的各兄弟国家人民的援助下，我们已经拥有许多强大的机械工厂，直接制造旋床、磨擦压力机等各种工作母机。我们的工业不但在产量指标上大大地超过了战前水平，而且在规模和技术装备上也有了根本的变化。
    我国的农村经济也有巨大的变化。广大农民摆脱了历史遗留下来的贫穷，踏上了生活富裕之路——社会主义的道路。到今年一月一日为止，农业生产合作社的数目已达12，132个，参加合作社的农户占全国农户总数的49％，合作社的耕地面积占耕地总面积的48％。切身体会到合作经济的优越性的农民正以高度的热情展开组织农业生产合作社的运动，这已成为今天我们农村生活中的基本特征。
    这一切胜利和成就，都是在朝鲜劳动党的英明的领导下获得的，是党的政策的正确性在实际生活中的具体表现。我国人民紧密地团结在劳动党的周围，正在为祖国的和平统一和在北半部建立社会主义基础而奋斗。全体朝鲜人民无限地信赖和爱戴引导他们从胜利走向胜利的劳动党，并以高度的劳动热情迎接党的第三次代表大会。
    去年十二月，平壤市的工人们得到党召开第三次代表大会的消息后，集会通过了以高度的劳动成就迎接大会的决议，并向全国工人们发出了超额完成1956年度人民经济计划的倡议。民主首都工人们的这一倡议，立刻引起了广泛的反应。水丰发电厂、清津炼钢厂、古干原煤矿、平壤橡胶工厂、平南灌溉工程建设公司长桥事业所等厂矿企业的工人们，积极响应平壤市工人们的倡议，最先展开了增产竞赛，并且各自向同业部门的工人们发起了增产竞赛。
    向全国炼铁、炼钢工人们倡议发起了增产竞赛运动的清津炼钢厂工人们，通过了庄严的决议：动员和发现本厂内部的一切潜在力量，在1956年4月15日以前，完成三年计划所赋予的全部生产量。响应这个倡议的黄海炼铁厂工人们，已经进入了缩短炼铁时间、增加炼铁量的斗争。“朝苏友谊”平炉的炼铁工人们已经取得了第一个成就：他们已经把炼铁时间缩短了两小时，又把出铁量增加了十吨，已经把一月份钢块生产计划超额完成了21％。
    在美帝国主义发动的侵略战争中遭到严重破坏的兴南肥料工厂，现在已经向农村供应大量化学肥料。为了恢复到年产六万吨硫酸铵肥料，该厂工人们展开了热火朝天的竞赛。
    铁路部门的工人们展开安全行驶和提高牵引量的增产竞赛运动。去年在安全行驶十万公里的斗争中，先后争取了两次胜利的熙川机务段的机车司机们，准备献给党代表大会的礼物——二十万公里的安全行驶，将在“五一”节以前完成。他们在年初的头一个礼拜里，把货物的牵引量比原订计划提高了10％，现在正在继续扩大他们的劳动成就。
    二月八日，我国的工人们又接到了另一个令人欢欣的消息，在我国机械工业的发展上具有重要意义的崔昌燮同志所属的新的机械工厂，工人们曾在装配现代机器中，发挥了自己的智慧，克服了种种困难，使全厂提前投入了生产。
    我国人民为迎接劳动党第三次代表大会而展开的劳动竞赛的主要特征，是劳动生产率的提高、特别是为节省劳动力的创造性的热情。劳动力问题是在停战后我国人民经济的恢复建设中最尖锐的问题之一。由于劳动力缺乏，党号召劳动人民为节省劳动力而斗争，特别是要提高机械化的程度。劳动人民都清楚地懂得：机械化的意义不仅在于节省劳动力，而且在于它将扫除历史遗留下来的我国经济的落后性。机械化是提高劳动生产率的基本道路。
    我国劳动人民在“要以不愧为社会主义建设者的方法进行工作”的口号下，用实际的斗争成就来回答着党的号召。机械工业部门的工人们，从今年起着手生产起重机等各种先进的建设机械，结果良好。建筑部门正在大力推行设计的标准化、建筑材料生产的工业化以及施工的工厂化等。
    轻工业部门从去年末到今年一月末为止，在生产中采用的工人的创造发明达1，531件，这比去年一年间的创造发明还要多。这就给轻工业部门创造了能够节省三千名劳动力的条件。
    我国的农村在冬天就广泛地掀起了劳动高潮。广大劳动人民正在修建三百七十多个大规模的灌溉工程，其中包括在我国历史上未曾有过的大规模的平南灌溉工程。由于参加建设的工人和农民们在冰天雪地中展开了劳动竞赛，这一巨大的水利工程将在四月二十五日以前提前完工。
    此外，扩大和改良土地的工作也很活跃。各地的农业生产合作社社员们，正以团结的力量有效地进行着恢复熟荒地、开垦生荒地和运土作业的工作，这些工作在单干时是不能想像的。
    我国的作家和艺术家们都以自己的创作成就来迎接朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会。献给党代表大会的几篇诗和小说等已经在出版中。各剧院都忙着作上演的准备。
    进入战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划的最后一年的我国人民，正怀着高度的自豪和激动的心情迎接着将提示新的胜利的朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会。
    最近召开的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的成就，大大地鼓舞了我国人民，使我们更加坚定了对和平、民主、社会主义事业胜利的信心。
    在劳动党的领导下，朝鲜人民正满怀信心地为在共和国北半部建设社会主义基础、为争取祖国的和平统一、为保卫远东和世界和平而进行坚决的斗争。　（本报特约稿）
