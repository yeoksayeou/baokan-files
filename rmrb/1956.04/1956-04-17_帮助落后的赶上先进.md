    Pursuing progress and contributing more to our country's socialist construction is the common trend among the vast number of workers in the industrial and transportation sectors recently. In various departments, the ranks of advanced producers have expanded unprecedentedly, new records exceeding quotas are constantly emerging, many people who previously could not meet quotas have become advanced producers, and many "key work sections," "weak workshops," and "backward enterprises" have also taken on a new look and reached advanced levels. However, the phenomenon of advanced and backward "coexisting peacefully" still exists in large numbers. In particular, as advanced enterprises and individuals move forward by leaps and bounds, backward enterprises and individuals are even more prominently exposed. For example, in manufacturing the same type of forging hammer, the actual man-hours consumed per unit at Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory are 1,392 hours, while at Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory they are only 546 hours, with a difference of more than double between the two factories. The scrap rate for machining is 3.5% at Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, but as high as 18.65% at Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Factory. Even within advanced enterprises, the levels achieved by individuals and units vary. Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory investigated 339 procedures in the second workshop for processing 1K36 lathes that exceeded quotas, and found that 91 procedures exceeded quotas by more than 100%, while 188 procedures exceeded quotas by less than 50%, of which 60 procedures exceeded quotas by less than 10%. At the same time, due to the development of the advanced producer movement, the positions of advanced and backward are often interchanged. Some people and units, which were originally advanced, have become relatively backward compared to those newly emerged, more advanced ones. Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 open hearth furnace repeatedly set new records for rapid steelmaking in the past, but it has now been overtaken by the previously backward "old ox furnace" - No. 7 open hearth furnace. All these indicate that while the ranks of advanced producers are constantly expanding, backward phenomena still exist. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously help the backward catch up with the advanced, so that the advanced become even more advanced.
    However, some people are now intoxicated by the huge numbers of advanced producers, rationalization proposals, and new records, turning a blind eye to the actual differences between the advanced and the backward, and not taking them seriously. They only support the advanced and commend the advanced, but do not do enough to care for, help, and spur the backward to catch up. It should be affirmed that supporting the advanced is entirely necessary, and many enterprises have not done enough in this regard and need to continue to strengthen it; however, the work of eliminating the backward is equally important and must be carried out simultaneously. Originally, supporting the advanced and eliminating the backward are two aspects of the same thing. We support the advanced, welcome advanced producers, and welcome new records because they point out the path to eliminating the backward and provide the possibility for generally improving the level of industrial production. Supporting the advanced is precisely for the purpose of eliminating the backward and seeking general improvement. If we do not pay attention to eliminating the backward, supporting the advanced will lose its practical significance. Moreover, because industrial production is interconnected, if we do not pay attention to eliminating the backward, the achievements of the advanced are often not consolidated, and their role cannot be fully exerted.
    There are also some people who, although aware of the difference between the advanced and the backward and believe that the backward should catch up with the advanced, feel that the masses are in high spirits and eager to make progress, and that the leadership does not need to expend much effort, and the backward will catch up. Therefore, they relax specific ideological and organizational work. They do not understand that without leadership, relying only on the spontaneous enthusiasm of the masses, it is impossible to eliminate backward phenomena. This is because there are various reasons why some people in enterprises cannot complete their quotas and are relatively backward in production. Some need help to improve their ideological awareness, some need help to improve their technical skills, and some need help to solve some practical difficulties and problems in their lives that affect their production mood. In various industrial systems, there are also some backward enterprises that cannot consistently and comprehensively complete their plans, and the reasons are also diverse. Some need help to solve the problem of disunity among leading cadres, some need help to improve their leadership methods, and some need help to solve some specific difficulties in technical equipment, technical supply, and so on. These many different specific situations require leaders of various departments and enterprises to take various different measures and conduct various specific works in depth. Letting things take their own course is not acceptable.
    In order to effectively eliminate the backward and enable more people and more enterprises to improve to advanced levels, various departments and enterprises should summarize and promote the effective experience of eliminating the backward and promoting progress. The 53rd Factory conducted an in-depth investigation into the reasons why each backward person was backward, adopted different methods to educate them, helped them solve their difficulties, and assigned advanced producers to help them ideologically and technically, so that backward people generally made progress. The Ministry of Railways and the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union organized advanced producers such as Zhuang Minggeng to go on tour to various locomotive and rolling stock repair factories across the country to perform, enabling many workers to master their advanced experience. The First Ministry of Machine Building organized comprehensive working groups, including Soviet experts from various fields, to go to some factories that were not producing well enough to help them carry out comprehensive and thorough reforms, turning the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, which originally had low product quality and was not on track, into an advanced enterprise. In inter-factory competitions in many industries, similar factories are organized to exchange experiences, learn from each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, so that all factories have jointly improved. These are all good methods.
    To enable more people to improve to advanced levels and to be able to comprehensively complete and overfulfill various technical and economic quotas, it is not enough to only help the masses establish advanced ideas and master advanced technologies; if the management level of enterprises is not correspondingly improved, it will stifle the enthusiasm of the masses, limit their ability to exert their talents, and render heroes useless. For example, they learn advanced cutting experience, but do not have cutting tools; they guarantee to improve quality, but do not have accurate measuring instruments. This is a very important reason why many enterprises cannot get rid of backward conditions, advanced experience cannot be adhered to, new records cannot be consolidated, and national plans cannot be well completed. Similarly, to enable more enterprises to improve to advanced levels and to be able to comprehensively complete and overfulfill national plans, it is not enough to only help enterprises improve their internal shortcomings; if the leadership level of higher-level economic organs is not correspondingly improved, it will also limit the progress of enterprises. For example, enterprises can greatly increase production capacity and speed up the pace of production development, but higher-level economic organs cannot help them organize cooperation with other enterprises in a timely manner, and cannot help them solve technical supply problems that can be solved in a timely manner. As a result, the potential of enterprises cannot be fully realized, and the country's industrial production cannot develop faster. Therefore, the task of eliminating backwardness and promoting progress cannot be limited to the scope of employees and factories and mines, but also requires national economic organs at all levels to improve their work.
    The current situation is: First, the vast masses are actively demanding to improve their technical level and learn advanced experience, making the elimination of backwardness and the promotion of progress have a deeper mass base than in any period in the past; Second, production records are changing with each passing day, and advanced experience is emerging one after another, making the elimination of backwardness and the promotion of progress have a broader path and clearer goals than in any period in the past. If the leaders of various departments and enterprises can fully utilize the current favorable situation, rely on the enthusiasm of the masses, better exert the role of advanced producers, and earnestly improve leadership work, they can more effectively eliminate backwardness, enable each person and each enterprise to continuously improve, and make the country's industrial production and industrial construction develop faster and better.

### 帮助落后的赶上先进

    帮助落后的赶上先进
    追求进步，为我国社会主义建设多出一把力，是最近一个时期工业运输部门中广大职工的普遍动向。在各个部门中，先进生产者的队伍空前扩大，突破定额的新纪录不断出现，许多过去达不到定额的人变成了先进生产者，不少“关键工段”、“薄弱车间”和“落后企业”也面貌一新，达到了先进的水平。但是，先进同落后“和睦相处”的现象仍然是大量存在的，特别是先进的企业和个人突飞猛进地前进了，落后的企业和个人就更突出地暴露出来。例如，制造同一种锻钎机，在贵阳矿山机器厂，每台实际消耗工时1，392小时，上海矿山机器厂只有546小时，两厂相差一倍多。机械加工的废品率，上海机床厂是3.5％，齐齐哈尔第二机床厂却高达18.65％。就在先进企业中，各个人和各个单位所达到的水平也是参差不齐的。沈阳第三机床厂调查了第二车间加工1K36车床突破定额的339道工序，发现超过定额100％以上的有91道，超额不到50％的有188道，其中超额10％以下的有60道。同时，由于先进生产者运动的开展，先进的同落后的地位也常是互换的，有一些人和单位，本来是先进的，但同那些新出现的，更加先进的比较，也相对地落后了。鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂一号平炉，过去一再创造快速炼钢的新纪录，现在却被一向落后的“老牛炉”——七号平炉赶上了。这些都说明，在先进生产者队伍不断扩大的同时，落后现象仍然是存在的。因此，必须不断地帮助落后赶上先进，使先进的更加先进。
    但是，现在却有些人在庞大的先进生产者、合理化建议和新纪录的数字面前陶醉了，对实际存在的先进同落后的差别熟视无睹，不以为意。他们只是支持先进，表扬先进，但如何关怀、帮助和鞭策落后的赶上去却做得不够。应当肯定，支持先进是完全必要的，而且许多企业在这方面做得还很不够，还需要继续加强；但是，消除落后的工作同样重要，必须同时进行。本来，支持先进和消除落后是一件事情的两个方面。我们支持先进，欢迎先进生产者，欢迎新纪录，是因为他们给消除落后指出了道路，给普遍提高工业的生产水平提供了可能性。支持先进，正是为了消除落后，求得普遍的提高。如果不注意消除落后，支持先进就失去了实际意义。而且，由于工业生产是相互联系的，如果不注意消除落后，先进者的成就往往不能巩固，他们的作用也不能充分发挥。
    还有一些人，虽然意识到先进同落后的差别，也认为应该使落后的赶上先进的，但他们觉得群众的情绪很高，要求进步的心很切，不需要领导上花多大力量，落后的就会赶上来，因而放松了具体的思想工作和组织工作。他们不了解，如果没有领导，只靠群众自发的热情，落后现象是不可能消除的。因为，企业中存在一些完不成定额的、生产上比较落后的人，原因是多种多样的。有的需要帮助他们提高思想觉悟，有的需要帮助他们提高技术水平，有的需要帮助他们解决一些影响生产情绪的生活上实际存在的困难和问题。在各个产业系统，也存在着一些不能经常全面完成计划的落后企业，原因也是多种多样的。有的需要帮助他们解决领导干部不团结的问题，有的需要帮助他们改进领导方法，有的需要帮助他们解决一些技术装备、技术供应等等具体困难。这许许多多不同的具体情况，都需要各个部门和各个企业的领导者采取各种不同的措施，深入进行各种具体的工作，听其自流是不行的。
    为了切实消除落后，使更多的人、使更多的企业都能提高到先进的水平，各个部门和各个企业应该总结和推广消除落后、推动前进的有成效的经验。五三工厂深入调查每一个落后的人所以落后的原因，采用不同的方法来教育他们，给他们解决困难，并且指定先进生产者从思想上、技术上帮助他们，使落后的人普遍有了进步。铁道部和中国铁路工会全国委员会组织庄铭耕等先进生产者，到全国各个机车车辆修理工厂去巡回表演，使得许多工人掌握了他们的先进经验。第一机械工业部组织包括有各方面苏联专家参加的综合工作组，到某些生产还不够好的工厂去，帮助他们进行全面的、彻底的改革，使得原来产品质量低、工作不上轨道的沈阳第二机床厂，变成了一个先进企业。许多产业在厂际竞赛中，组织同类型的工厂交流经验，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，使各个工厂都共同得到了提高。这些都是很好的方法。
    要使更多的人都提高到先进的水平，都能够全面完成和超额完成各项技术经济定额，只帮助群众树立先进的思想，掌握先进的技术，是不够的；如果不相应地提高企业的管理水平，就会束缚群众的积极性，限制他们发挥自己的才能，使得英雄无用武之地。例如，他们学会了先进的切削经验，但是没有刀具；他们保证提高质量，但是没有准确的计量仪器。许多企业所以不能摆脱落后状况，先进经验不能坚持，新纪录不能巩固，国家计划不能很好地完成，这是很重要的原因。同样地，要使更多的企业都提高到先进的水平，都能够全面完成和超额完成国家计划，只帮助企业改进内部工作的缺点，也是不够的；如果不相应地提高上级经济机关的领导水平，也会限制企业的进步。例如，企业可以大大提高生产能力，加快生产发展的速度，但是上级经济机关不能及时帮助他们组织好同其他企业的协作，不能及时帮助他们解决可能解决的技术供应问题，结果，使得企业的潜力不能充分发挥，使得国家工业生产不能更快地向前发展。因此，不能把消除落后、推动前进的任务仅仅局限在职工群众和厂矿企业的范围内，而且要求国家各级经济机关都必须提高自己的工作。
    当前的情况是：第一，广大群众积极要求提高技术水平，学习先进经验，使得消除落后，推动前进具有了比过去任何时期更深厚的群众基础；第二，生产纪录日新月异，先进经验层出不穷，使得消除落后，推动前进具有了比过去任何时期更广阔的道路和更鲜明的目标。各个部门和各个企业的领导者如果能充分利用当前的有利形势，依靠群众的积极性，更好地发挥先进生产者的作用，切实改进领导工作，就可以更有效地消除落后，使每个人每个企业都不断地提高，使国家的工业生产和工业建设更快、更好地向前发展。
