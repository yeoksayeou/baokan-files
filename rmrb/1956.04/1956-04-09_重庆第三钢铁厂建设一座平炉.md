    Chongqing Third Steel Plant to Build an Open-Hearth Furnace
    The Chongqing Third Steel Plant began construction of a new open-hearth furnace in early April. Currently, the earthwork and stonework and mechanical repair work for the open-hearth furnace have begun.
    The Chongqing Third Steel Plant is a factory that produces important railway accessories—tie plates. The tie plates for the national railway department are supplied by this factory. In the past, this factory had a small steelmaking capacity but a large steel rolling capacity. After the new open-hearth furnace is put into production, the steel production capacity can be doubled compared to the present.

    重庆第三钢铁厂建设一座平炉
    重庆第三钢铁厂在四月初开工新建一座平炉。目前平炉的土石方工程和机修工程都已开始进行。
    重庆第三钢铁厂是生产铁路重要配件——垫板的工厂，全国铁路部门的垫板都由这个工厂供给。这个工厂过去炼钢能力小，轧钢能力大。新建的这座平炉投入生产以后，钢的生产能力可以比现在增加一倍。
