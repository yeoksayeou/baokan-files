Xinhua News Agency, April 9th, Moscow Dispatch: According to TASS, Soviet citizens have been requesting news organizations and TASS to report on Bulganin and Khrushchev's upcoming visit to Britain at the invitation of the British government.

According to reliable sources at TASS, the Soviet leaders are scheduled to arrive in Britain on April 18th. According to the plan put forward by the British government, Bulganin and Khrushchev will meet and hold talks with British government leaders and British political figures during their visit to Britain. In addition to visiting London, Bulganin and Khrushchev will also visit Harwell, Oxford, Edinburgh, Birmingham, and other cities. The plan also stipulates that the Soviet leaders will visit the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Center and the British Industries Fair in Birmingham, as well as the Royal Air Force base at Marham.

The Soviet leaders are scheduled to conclude their visit to Britain on April 27th.

Bulganin and Khrushchev have received many letters from British agencies, social organizations, and British citizens expressing their hope that the Soviet leaders will be able to visit certain factories and organizations and meet with British citizens during their visit to Britain. According to Malik, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, the Soviet Embassy has also received many such letters.

A TASS reporter asked Bulganin and Khrushchev for their views on this issue.

They said that the wishes of these British citizens who hope to meet them are completely understandable.

The Soviet leaders believe that the upcoming talks with the leaders of the British government and the meetings with British social figures are of great significance. At the same time, they hope to meet with ordinary people working in enterprises and institutions, as they consider such meetings to be an important way to consolidate the friendly relations between the people of Britain and the Soviet Union.

The itinerary for the Soviet leaders' visit to Britain was formulated by the British side. In the original draft itinerary, in addition to talks with government officials, it was also stipulated to visit many industrial enterprises, institutions, and British agricultural areas, including enterprises in Scotland and Wales.

In order to have the opportunity to learn more about all aspects of British life, Bulganin and Khrushchev expressed their hope to extend their visit to Britain by two days. However, although the British side agreed to extend the Soviet leaders' visit to Britain, the plan did not include visits to enterprises and institutions in Scotland and Wales, nor talks with residents, which is regrettable. Moreover, the British side also canceled visits to many industrial projects that had already been designated from its previous plan. The final plan, which was transferred by the British Foreign Office, once stipulated a visit to an enterprise in Birmingham, but for some reason, the visit to this enterprise has recently been removed from the plan.

Bulganin and Khrushchev told the TASS reporter that they were deeply grateful for the kind invitations from the hospitable British citizens, but they were unable to take advantage of these invitations because the plan put forward by the British side did not include these visits.

It seems that there are still certain forces in Britain who do not want Soviet leaders to have more extensive exchanges with British residents.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫谈访英日程问题
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏联公民请求各报社编辑部和塔斯社报道布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫应英国政府邀请即将访问英国的消息。
    据塔斯社从可靠方面获悉，苏联的领导者订于四月十八日到达英国。根据英国政府所提出的计划，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在访问英国期间将同英国政府的领导者和英国政界人士会晤和会谈。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫除访问伦敦外，还将访问哈威尔、牛津、爱丁堡、伯明翰和其他一些城市。计划还规定，苏联的领导者将参观哈威尔原子能研究中心和伯明翰英国工业博览会，并且访问马列姆皇家空军基地。
    苏联的领导者订于四月二十七日结束在英国的访问。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫接到了英国各机关、社会团体和英国公民寄来的许多信件，这些信件表示希望苏联的领导者在访问英国期间能够访问某些工厂和机关，同英国公民会面。据苏联驻英国大使马立克说，苏联大使馆也接到了许多这样的信件。
    塔斯社记者请求布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫对这个问题表示意见。
    他们说，希望同他们会面的这些英国公民的愿望是完全可以理解的。
    苏联的领导者认为即将同英国政府的领导者举行的会谈和同英国社会人士的会晤是有重大意义的，同时他们希望同在企业和机关工作的普通人民会面，因为他们认为这种会晤是巩固英国和苏联两国人民友好关系的重要方法之一。
    苏联的领导者在英国的访问计划是英国方面制定的。在原先拟定的访问计划中，除了同政府人士谈话外，还规定参观许多工业企业、机关和英国农业区，其中包括在苏格兰和威尔士的企业。
    为了有机会更多地了解英国各方面的生活，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫表示希望在英国的访问期限延长两天。但是，尽管英国方面同意延长苏联领导者在英国访问的期限，可是在计划中却没有包括参观苏格兰和威尔士的企业和机构以及同居民的谈话，这是令人遗憾的。而且，英国方面还从它以前提出的计划中取消了对已经指定的许多工业工程的访问。在英国外交部转交的最后计划中曾经规定访问伯明翰的一家企业，但是不知道为了什么缘故，最近在计划中又取消了对这家企业的访问。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫告诉塔斯社记者说，他们深深感谢好客的英国公民的亲切的邀请，但是他们不能够享受这些邀请。因为英国方面提出的计划中没有包括这些访问。
    看来，在英国还有某些势力不希望苏联领导者同英国居民进行更加广泛的来往。
