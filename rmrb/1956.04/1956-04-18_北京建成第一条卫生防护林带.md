Beijing Completes First Sanitary Protection Forest Belt
Beijing's first sanitary protection forest belt was completed on the 17th. This forest belt is located in the Jiuxianqiao area outside Dongzhimen, with a total length of 3,500 meters and a width of 350 meters. Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing planted more than 300,000 trees in this forest belt.

The designers who designed this forest belt carefully studied wind speed and smoke and dust concentration, dividing the forest belt into three layers to gradually weaken and filter the wind, sand, or smoke and dust after passing through the forest belt. In two years, this forest belt will separate the workers' residential area from the factory, allowing workers to breathe fresh air every day.

The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks and Woods also plans to build two small windbreak and sand-fixation forest belts in the northwest and north suburbs to locally improve Beijing's environmental hygiene.

    北京建成第一条卫生防护林带
    北京第一条卫生防护林带已经在十七日建成。这条林带在东直门外酒仙桥一带，全长三千五百公尺、宽三百五十公尺。中国人民解放军驻北京部队的军官和士兵们在这条林带里，栽上了三十多万株树木。
    设计这条林带的设计人员，仔细研究了风速和烟尘浓度等情况，把林带分成三层，使风沙或烟尘经过林带后逐渐减弱、滤清。两年以后，这条林带将把工人住宅区和工厂隔开，使工人们每天都呼吸到新鲜空气。
    北京市园林局还计划在西北郊和北郊建造两条小型防风沙的林带，局部改善北京的环境卫生。
