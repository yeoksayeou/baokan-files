    Chen Yi Extends Greetings to Builders of Qinghai and Qaidam
    (Our dispatch from Golmud, April 8th) Chen Yi, Head of the Central Delegation to Tibet and Vice Premier of the State Council, along with the Deputy Heads of the Central Delegation, expressed their cordial greetings to the personnel constructing Qinghai and Qaidam at a mass meeting of four thousand people held here today. They also met with the local Kazakh people.
    Chen Yi spoke at the mass meeting. Chen Yi said: We must correct the mistaken notion of viewing Qinghai and Qaidam as border regions. Qinghai is the heart of our motherland. In a few years, the railway will be built here and will pass through here to Lhasa in Tibet. Many modern factories will be built here. Those who came here first to participate in the construction are glorious. In the future, the country will continue to mobilize more personnel to join you in building Qinghai and Qaidam. Chen Yi said: We are very pleased to see that the Han, Tibetan, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups are united like brothers here. With people and ethnic unity, everything can be done well. Chen Yi presented the gifts from the Central Delegation to Ha Mu (Kazakh ethnicity), Deputy Governor of the Haixi Mongol-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, and others.
    The accompanying art troupe performed a consolation performance on the grasslands of the Qaidam Basin.
    The Central Delegation arrived in Golmud on the 7th.

    陈毅慰问青海和柴达木的建设者
    本报格尔穆8日电　赴西藏的中央代表团团长、国务院副总理陈毅和中央代表团的各副团长，今天在这里举行的有四千人参加的群众大会上，向建设青海、建设柴达木的工作人员表示亲切的慰问，并同当地的哈萨克族人民见了面。
    陈毅在群众大会上讲了话。陈毅说：我们要纠正把青海和柴达木看作是边疆地区的错误观念。青海是我们祖国的心脏，再过几年，铁路将要修到这里，并且通过这里修到西藏的拉萨。这里将要建设起许多现代化的工厂。最先来到这里参加建设的人是光荣的。国家今后将继续动员更多的人员来和你们一起建设青海，建设柴达木。陈毅说：我们在这里看到汉、藏、哈萨克等各民族人民团结得像兄弟一样，非常高兴。有了人，有了民族团结，什么事情都可以做好。陈毅将中央代表团赠送的礼品，授给青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州副州长哈木（哈萨克族）等。
    随团文艺工作队在柴达木盆地的草滩上进行了慰问演出。
    中央代表团是七日到格尔穆的。
