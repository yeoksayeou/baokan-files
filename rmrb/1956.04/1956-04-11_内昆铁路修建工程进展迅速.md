Since the full-scale construction of the Neijiang-Yibin section of the Neijiang-Kunming Railway began at the end of February, the project has progressed rapidly. As of April 3rd, two bridge piers of the Fuxi River Bridge, a key project near Zigong, had been completed ahead of schedule. The Chaotianmen Tunnel in Neijiang is being excavated rapidly. More than 120,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed on the 150-kilometer section. The construction workers have pledged to strive for early traffic opening to Zigong.

    内昆铁路修建工程进展迅速
    内昆铁路内江至宜宾段，从二月底全面动工以后，工程进展迅速。到四月三日止，自贡附近的重点工程——釜溪河大桥有两个桥墩已经提前完工。内江的朝天门隧道正在迅速掘进。全段一百五十公里的线路上，已经完成十二万多方土石方。筑路员工提出保证，争取提前通车到自贡。
