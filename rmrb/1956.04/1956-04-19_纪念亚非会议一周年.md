Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 18th: Nehru issues congratulatory message.

    Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a congratulatory message on April 18th, the first anniversary of the Bandung Conference.
    He said: On this day, let the countries and peoples of Asia and Africa dedicate themselves to the goals for which we gathered in Bandung and the principles of world peace and cooperation that we unanimously declared there, and reaffirm our belief in these goals and principles.
    Nehru said: The Bandung Conference, recognized worldwide as a historic event, proclaimed the political emergence of half the world's population in international affairs. For dependent peoples, Bandung gave hope and strength. We are pleased that since then, some of them have emerged from dependent status, while others are on the path to liberation. In their struggle for freedom, we stand with them.
    Nehru said: The keynote of the Bandung Conference—achieving world peace and cooperation—is still threatened by the hydrogen bomb, by colonialism, by the relative economic backwardness of Asian and African countries, by the widespread prevalence of doctrines of national and racial inequality, and by the insufficient economic, cultural, and political cooperation among the countries attending the Bandung Conference.
    Nehru said: The Bandung Conference unleashed powerful forces, proclaimed a new spirit, and aroused great hope. Now is the time for us to make greater progress with our common and national efforts to help achieve our goals more and more.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 18th: Sastroamidjojo sends telegram to the Asian-African Group at the United Nations.

    Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo sent a telegram to the Asian-African Group at the United Nations on April 18th, the first anniversary of the Bandung Conference. The telegram said that the Asian-African Group at the United Nations is now stronger than ever before. The Asian-African Group has grown in number and its prestige has increased, thanks to the activities of the Asian-African countries themselves and the achievements of the Bandung Conference.
    The telegram said: "The great significance of the Bandung Conference has been particularly manifested in the United Nations. The San Francisco Conference commemorating the tenth anniversary of the United Nations recognized that lessons could be drawn from Bandung (Conference). At the last (United Nations) General Assembly, people spoke of the Bandung Conference with understanding and praise."
    The telegram said: "In assessing the achievements of the Bandung Conference, we must remember its influence on the realization of independence for Morocco and Tunisia, and the bright future it showed to regions of the world that have not yet gained freedom. We are pleased to note that your group has taken the necessary steps to support the Algerian independence movement in accordance with the Bandung Declaration."
    The telegram said: "The impact of the Bandung Conference is also reflected in the admission of sixteen new member states to the United Nations, which brings the organization closer to its ideal of universality. I sincerely hope that the People's Republic of China, Japan, Outer Mongolia, Sudan, Tunisia, and Morocco will soon be admitted to the United Nations. When Malaya gains independence, we hope it will also join this great organization."
    The telegram said: "In our troubled and divided world, nothing is more important than maintaining secure and lasting peace. In this regard, the Bandung Conference has also played a significant role in easing world tensions. The government and people of Indonesia sincerely and deeply hope that all troubled regions of the world will achieve lasting peace in accordance with justice and the legitimate aspirations of the peoples concerned."
    The telegram concluded by expressing the hope that the Asian-African Group at the United Nations will continue to uphold the spirit of the ten principles of the Bandung Peace Declaration.

Soviet Newspapers
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 18th: Many Moscow newspapers today published articles commemorating the first anniversary of the Bandung Conference. "Pravda" wrote in an article entitled "One Year After Bandung": The year after the Bandung Conference proved the unyielding determination of the people of the East to strive for peace and security, defend independence, and completely eliminate the shameful colonial system of imperialism. The people of the East have already achieved remarkable achievements on this road. The Soviet people hope that the peoples of Asian and African countries will achieve new victories in the struggle for independence, liberation, and the victorious realization of the principles of friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence.
    "Izvestia" published an article entitled "The Bandung Spirit." "Trud" published an article entitled "The Bandung Spirit Exists and Triumphs."

Korean "Rodong Sinmun"
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 18th: Pyongyang newspapers published commentaries on the 18th commemorating the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference. "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary entitled "The Victorious Advance of the Bandung Spirit," saying that the Bandung Spirit has shown great vitality in the past year. The collapse of colonialism, the growth of peaceful forces, and the enormous influence of the Asian and African people on international affairs in the past year all illustrate this point. The commentary pointed out that the Bandung Spirit has further united the Asian and African people. Including the hundreds of millions of people in the Asian and African regions, the socialist and non-socialist peace-loving countries of Europe and Asia constitute a strong peace zone and are growing stronger.

Vietnamese "Nhan Dan"
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 18th: The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published an editorial today commemorating the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference. The editorial said that the first Asian-African Conference held in Bandung a year ago marked a turning point in the political life of the awakening 1.5 billion Asian and African people. In the past year, the people of Asian and African countries have increasingly resolutely opposed colonialism and military blocs, and the ranks of countries advocating peaceful neutrality have been growing. This is the victory of the spirit of the Asian-African Conference.
    "Nhan Dan" pointed out that the enemies of the Asian and African people are still unwilling to abandon their policies of enslaving Asia and Africa. In this situation and in commemorating the Asian-African Conference, it is required that the people and authorities of Asian and African countries strengthen their vigilance, and further strengthen the friendly relations between Asian and African countries, and between Asian and African countries and other peace-loving countries.

"The Japan Times"
Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Tokyo dispatch: "The Japan Times" said in its editorial today: "The most important result of the Bandung Conference is the new spirit of self-confidence gained by the participating countries. They have gained new status by participating in this conference, and they have begun to make their voices heard at world conferences. Is there any more important significance than this?"
    The newspaper also said in its editorial commemorating the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference that the undeniable achievements of the conference prove that a new era has begun in international relations. It said: "Although it cannot be expected that their actions will be absolutely consistent due to the very different political, social, and economic backgrounds of the peoples of all these countries, it must be admitted that in the past year, the countries that participated in the Bandung Conference, or some of them, have shown that they are very easy to cooperate with."

    纪念亚非会议一周年
    尼赫鲁发表祝词
    新华社新德里18日电　印度总理尼赫鲁在四月十八日万隆会议一周年的时候发表了一篇祝词。
    他说：在这个日子里，让我们亚洲和非洲的国家和人民献身于我们为之在万隆聚会的目标和我们一致在那里宣布的关于世界和平和合作的原则，并且重申我们对这些目标和原则的信念。
    尼赫鲁说：被全世界公认为历史性的事件的万隆会议，宣告了世界一半的人口在政治上出现在国际事务中。对于附属的人民，万隆给予了希望和力量。我们高兴的是：从那时以来，他们中间有些已经脱离了附属地位，而其他一些人也正在脱离的路途中。在他们争取自由的努力中，我们的立场是和他们在一起。
    尼赫鲁说：万隆会议的基调——达到世界和平和合作——仍然受着氢弹的威胁，受到殖民主义、受到亚非国家相对的经济落后状态、受到民族和种族不平等学说的普遍流行以及出席万隆会议的各国间经济、文化和政治合作的不足的阻挠和妨害。
    尼赫鲁说：万隆会议解放了强大的力量，宣布了新的精神，并且引起了巨大的希望。现在是该由我们以我们共同的和国家的努力来作出更大的进展，以有助于越来越多地达到我们所追求的目标。

    电报说：“在估计万隆会议成果的时候，我们一定要记住它对摩洛哥和突尼斯实现独立的影响，以及它给还没有获得自由的世界各地区展示的光明前途。我们欣慰地注意到，你们集团已经根据万隆宣言采取了必要的步骤支持阿尔及利亚的独立运动。”
    电报说：“万隆会议的影响也表现在联合国接纳十六个新会员国这件事上面，这使得这个组织更接近了它的普遍性的理想。我衷心希望中华人民共和国、日本、外蒙古、苏丹、突尼斯和摩洛哥很快就会参加到联合国中。在马来亚获得独立的时候，我们希望它也参加这个巨大的组织。”
    电报说：“在我们这个多事的和分裂的世界里，再没有比维护安全和持久的和平更重要的了。在这一方面，万隆会议在缓和世界紧张局势方面也起了重大的作用。印度尼西亚政府和人民诚恳地和深切地希望世界上一切多事的地区都会依照正义和有关各国人民的正当的愿望得到持久的和平。”
