How to Treat Product Quality Exhibitions

    The Qin淮 district of Nanjing recently held an industrial product quality exhibition. Most of the forty-four factories and handicraft cooperatives participating in the exhibition exposed production shortcomings and proposed improvement measures through the exhibits to educate the masses, especially the employees of their own units. The Nanjing Knitting Underwear Factory, however, did not do this. During the exhibition preparation stage, they were reluctant to participate, making all sorts of excuses. Later, when they were compelled to participate in the exhibition, they displayed some colorful and beautiful products. Although they also displayed a few defective products with holes and oil stains, they did not display those products that had been criticized by consumers for being sold as good quality items while being of inferior quality. Of course, this could not fool the eyes of consumers. Consumers who had bought products from this factory raised many questions at the exhibition. Some people even said angrily: "Look, this underwear I have is from this factory. It shrank four or five inches after one wash. Why didn't they put the underwear that shrinks when it gets wet on display?"

    To use product quality exhibitions to educate the masses, especially the employees of the unit, one must neither exaggerate nor conceal shortcomings. Treating product quality exhibitions like the Nanjing Knitting Underwear Factory can only arouse the anger of consumers and encourage complacency among employees.

    怎样对待产品质量展览会
    南京市秦淮区最近举办了一次工业产品质量展览会。参加展览会的四十四个工厂和手工业合作社，大都通过展览品揭露了生产的缺点，提出了改进办法，以教育群众，特别是教育本单位的职工。南京针织内衣厂却不是这样，在展览会筹备阶段，就推三推四不愿参加展览，后来不得已而参加展出的时候，就拿些五颜六色的漂亮产品摆在那里，虽然也摆了几件破洞、油斑的废品，但是没把那些受到消费者指责的冒充好货出售的产品摆出来。当然，这样并不能骗过消费者的眼睛。买过这个厂的产品的消费者，在展览会上提出了许多质问。有的人甚至气愤地说：“看，我这件内衣就是这个厂的出品，洗了一次就缩了四、五寸，为什么不把他们生产的见水就缩的内衣拿出来展览呢？”
    要利用产品质量展览会来教育群众，特别是教育本单位的职工，就必须既不夸大缺点也不掩饰缺点。像南京针织内衣厂那样对待产品质量展览会，只能引起消费者的气愤，和助长职工的自满情绪。
