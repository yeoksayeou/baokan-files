    A Party Branch that Emphasizes Production Technology Leadership
    Zhang Liquan

    Ensuring the implementation of advanced cultivation techniques is an important task for rural Party organizations at present. The Jiangxi Township Party Branch in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, has a relatively clear understanding of this point, and therefore they have taken some concrete measures to organize cadres and the masses to learn advanced cultivation techniques, and have achieved great success.

    More than 50% of the land in Jiangxi Township is planted with cotton, and a considerable amount of sugarcane and tobacco are also grown. These crops are highly technical. This year's cotton yield is planned to increase from 42 jin of ginned cotton per mu last year to 75 jin, and the increase targets for other crops are all above 20%. The key to completing this production increase task lies in improving cultivation techniques. The Party branch studied this issue and believed that actively improving the production technology level of cadres and the masses is a prerequisite for ensuring the improvement of cultivation techniques. Therefore, the branch quickly took measures to solve this problem.

    In early February, with the specific assistance of the agricultural technology promotion station, the Party branch held a technical training class, drawing the deputy directors, production committee members, and technical team leaders from all 19 agricultural cooperatives in the township to study for three days. At that time, two erroneous ideas were relatively common among these cadres: one was that they did not believe that adopting new technologies could increase production; the other was that since the peasants had all joined the cooperatives, as long as they were told about it, everyone would follow the specifications, and no leadership was needed. During the study, by summarizing the experience of increased production during the spring harvest last year, the Party branch made everyone realize the huge role of promoting advanced cultivation techniques in ensuring increased production from the examples of Shengyang and other cooperatives that promoted several advanced cultivation methods last year and achieved significant production increases, dispelling concerns about promoting advanced technologies. The Party branch then criticized the idea that peasants would do it themselves and did not need leadership. Because the cadres of Jian and other cooperatives did not teach the masses advanced production technologies, the increase in production of cotton, sweet potatoes and other crops was not significant last year. The branch used this example to make everyone realize that it is necessary to strengthen leadership and actively help the masses master advanced production technologies in order to ensure the comprehensive promotion of advanced technologies. During the study, the Party branch led everyone to summarize the effective advanced experience of the local area, and formulated a relatively complete technical plan. In order to make more cadres understand the importance of promoting advanced technologies, the Party branch then held a meeting of more than 140 cadres above the level of production team leader, explaining the importance of promoting advanced technologies in light of this year's production tasks, and put forward a preliminary technical plan. The branch also educated Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, requiring them to play an exemplary leading role in learning and promoting advanced cultivation techniques, and to actively help the masses improve their technical level.

    Afterwards, the Party branch organized Party members and people who understood advanced technologies to carry out propaganda and teaching of advanced technologies among the masses in the township. In the past month or so, according to this year's production plan, the Party branch has explained the technical measures for six major crops to the farmers in the township once, and has combined the current production to conduct one or two specific lectures on the technical measures for planting potatoes, sweet potatoes, and sugarcane. In addition, it also organized the masses to teach each other and help each other improve.

    Thanks to the above-mentioned work done by the Party branch, several advanced cultivation techniques have been widely promoted throughout the township.

    一个重视生产技术领导的党支部
    张利泉
    保证先进耕作技术的推行，是当前农村党组织的重要任务。四川省简阳县绛溪乡党支部对这一点有比较明确的认识，因此他们已经采取了一些具体措施，组织干部和群众学习先进耕作技术，并且取得了很大的成绩。
    绛溪乡50％以上的土地种了棉花，还种了不少甘蔗、烟叶，这些作物的技术性都较强。今年棉花的产量，计划要由去年的每亩四十二斤皮棉提高到七十五斤，其他各种作物的增产指标都在20％以上。要完成这一增产任务的关键在于提高耕作技术。党支部对这一问题作了研究，认为积极提高干部和群众的生产技术水平，是保证耕作技术提高的先决条件。于是，支部就迅速采取措施来解决这一问题。
    在二月上旬，党支部在农业技术推广站的具体帮助下，举办了一次技术训练班，将全乡十九个农业社的副主任、生产委员和技术组长抽来学习了三天。当时，这些干部中较为普遍地存在着两种错误思想：一种是不大相信采用新技术以后能够增加生产；另一种是认为农民都入了社，只要给他们讲一下，大家都会照规格办事，不需要什么领导。在学习中，党支部通过总结去年大春增产的经验，使大家从升阳等合作社去年推行了几种先进耕作方法，获得显著增产的事例中，认识到推行先进耕作技术对保证增产的巨大作用，解除了对推行先进技术的顾虑。党支部接着又批判了认为农民自己会干不需要领导的思想。吉安等合作社由于干部没有把先进生产技术教给群众，以致去年棉花、红苕等作物增产不多。支部就用这个事例，使大家认识到必须加强领导，积极帮助群众掌握先进生产技术，才能保证先进技术的全面推行。在学习中，党支部领导大家总结了当地行之有效的先进经验，并且制定了一个较为完整的技术方案。为了使更多的干部了解推广先进技术的重要意义，党支部接着又召开了一百四十多人的生产小组长以上的干部会，结合今年的增产任务，说明推行先进技术的重要，并且提出了初步制定的技术方案。支部还向共产党员和青年团员进行了教育，要他们在学习和推行先进耕作技术中起模范带头作用，积极地帮助群众提高技术水平。
    以后，党支部组织党员和懂得先进技术的人，在全乡群众中进行先进技术的宣传和传授工作。一个多月来，党支部根据今年的生产计划，向全乡农民讲解了一次六种主要作物的技术措施，又结合当前生产，对洋芋、红苕、甘蔗播种的技术措施进行了一至二次的具体传授。此外，还组织群众互教互学，互相帮助提高。
    由于党支部做了上述工作，有几种先进耕作技术，已经在全乡普遍推行了。
