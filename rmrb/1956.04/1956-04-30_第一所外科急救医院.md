    The first surgical emergency hospital in China, the Shanghai Emergency Surgery Hospital, held its opening ceremony on the 28th. This hospital is located in the center of Shanghai and has 200 beds. The ambulances of the hospital are equipped with emergency equipment, so that doctors can provide patients with simple first aid when they arrive at the scene. If a patient needs to be hospitalized, the doctor will call the hospital to prepare, and the patient can undergo surgery immediately upon arrival at the hospital, without having to go through registration, queuing, or other procedures.
    The hospital currently has general surgery and orthopedics departments. There are thirty-nine orthopedic and surgical doctors. Some of these doctors have served on the Korean front and are more proficient in trauma emergency work.
    The hospital has also hired professors from Shanghai Higher Medical Schools, well-known thoracic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and traditional Chinese medicine trauma specialists as consultants and special physicians. (Xinhua News Agency)
