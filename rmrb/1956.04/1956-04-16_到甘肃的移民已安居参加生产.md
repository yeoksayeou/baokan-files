Opening Up Wasteland

    Since the beginning of this year, 25,000 immigrants from Beijing and Henan who have moved to the Hexi Corridor and the Yellow River Plain in northern Gansu have settled down and joined agricultural cooperatives with the warm reception of local farmers and cadres, and have invested themselves in agricultural production.
    As soon as the immigrants arrived at their destinations, they moved into rooms that local farmers had prepared for them in advance. Local farmers also provided them with many farming tools, daily necessities, and food rations, treating them like relatives from afar. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

    到甘肃的移民已安居参加生产
    今年年初到现在，由北京、河南迁移到甘肃河西走廊和甘肃北部黄河平原的二万五千移民，在当地农民和干部的热情接待下，已安居下来，参加了农业合作社，投入了农业生产。
    移民一到目的地后，便搬进当地农民为他们早已准备好的房间，当地农民还为他们调剂了许多农具、日常用具和口粮，像接待来自远方的亲人。　（本报驻兰州记者）
