Xinhua News Agency, 15th. According to TASS: Through various exchanges and contacts, the friendship and mutual understanding between the Soviet and British people is growing stronger day by day.

    The exchange of delegations between the Soviet Union and Britain is becoming more frequent. Shortly after the Soviet power expert delegation headed by Malenkov returned from Britain, a group of famous British musicians set off from London on the 14th to tour the Soviet Union. Soon, the Soviet Union and Britain will also exchange delegations of educators from Moscow University and Oxford University, delegations of surgeons, and delegations of machine manufacturing and industrial education experts. The relationship between Soviet and British cities is particularly noteworthy. Moscow has established friendly relations with London, Stalingrad with Coventry, and Sverdlovsk with Birmingham, and delegations have been exchanged for visits.
    The Soviet people love outstanding British cultural and artistic works. Recently, the British Art Exhibition held at the Pushkin State Museum in Moscow and the British Book Exhibition held at the Lenin State Library were warmly welcomed by Soviet audiences. Currently, 137 theaters across the Soviet Union are staging Shakespeare's plays. Famous plays such as "Hamlet" and "The Taming of the Shrew" performed in Moscow are almost always sold out, and in Leningrad, Shakespeare's plays have long been a regular feature on the stage. The National Shakespeare Conference, which opened in Moscow on April 10, has become a major event in the cultural life of the Soviet people. In addition, plays by Galsworthy and Maugham have also been well received in the Soviet Union. British films are also popular in the Soviet Union. In the Tyumen region of Siberia, a British Film Week began on April 10. A documentary about friendly exchanges between the Soviet Union and Britain, "Striving for Friendship and Cooperation," has been showing in Moscow cinemas since the 11th.
    Soviet people widely love the works of British classical and modern writers. They have been translated into 53 languages of the Soviet Union and published in 48 million copies. Works by Shakespeare, Dickens, Thackeray, Galsworthy, Aldrich and others can be seen almost everywhere.
    The scale of Soviet-British book exchanges is also growing. The largest Soviet Lenin State Library now exchanges books with 88 British organizations, more than double the number in 1954. It now has 300,000 British publications in its collection. The All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences and some research institutions of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture alone subscribe to more than 120 British agricultural journals.

    苏英人民友谊日益加强
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社报道：通过各种交往和接触，苏联人民和英国人民之间的友谊和相互了解正在日益加强。
    苏联和英国之间代表团的往返日益频繁。以马林科夫为首的苏联动力专家代表团刚从英国回来不久，英国一批出名的音乐家已经在十四日从伦敦起程到苏联去巡回演出了。不久，苏联和英国之间还要互派莫斯科大学和牛津大学教育工作者代表团、外科医生代表团、机器制造和工业教育专家代表团等。苏联和英国城市之间的关系特别引人注意。莫斯科同伦敦、斯大林格勒同考文垂、斯维德洛夫斯克同伯明翰都建立了友好关系，并且互派代表团进行访问。
    苏联人民热爱英国优秀的文化艺术作品。最近，在莫斯科国立普希金博物馆举行的英国艺术展览会和在国立列宁图书馆举行的英国书籍展览会，受到了苏联观众的热烈欢迎。目前全苏联有一百三十七个剧院正在上演莎士比亚的剧本。莫斯科演出的“汉姆莱脱”和“驯悍记”等名剧，几乎场场都是客满，而在列宁格勒，莎士比亚的剧本长时期来成了舞台上经常出现的剧目。四月十日起在莫斯科举行的全国莎士比亚会议，已经成为苏联人民文化生活中的一件大事。其余如高斯华绥、马科尔的剧本在苏联上演也获得了很大的欢迎。英国的影片也在苏联受到了欢迎，在西伯利亚的丘门州，从四月十日起举行了英国电影旬。一部纪录苏英友好交往的纪录片“争取友谊和合作”，从十一日起已经在莫斯科各影院上映。
    苏联人民广泛喜爱英国古典作家和现代作家的作品。它们已经被译成五十三种苏联民族的语言，印行了四千八百万册。莎士比亚、狄更斯、萨克莱、高斯华绥、阿尔德里奇等的作品几乎到处可以看到。
    苏联和英国图书交换的规模，也愈来愈大。苏联最大的国立列宁图书馆现在共和八十八个英国团体交换图书，比1954年多一倍多。现在它的书库里共有三十万种英国的出版物。单是全苏列宁农业科学院和苏联农业部的一些研究机关，就订了一百二十多种英国农业方面的期刊。
