    The Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace listened with satisfaction to and unanimously agreed with the report delivered by Chen Shutong, head of the Chinese delegation to the Special Meeting of the World Peace Council in Stockholm, on the situation and achievements of the meeting.
    The Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace congratulates the success of the Special Meeting of the World Peace Council in Stockholm, believing that the resolutions adopted at this meeting express the universal desire and common will of the people of all countries in the world to demand universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and to demand the strengthening and expansion of peaceful forces. These resolutions will help to further promote the cause of the people of all countries in seeking lasting peace and international cooperation.
    Today, millions of peace-loving people all over the world are eagerly hoping to see a quick end to the arms race that causes war fears and increases the burden on the people, and hoping to see the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission reach an agreement on disarmament issues as soon as possible at the London Conference.
    The Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace believes it is necessary to point out that some people who stubbornly cling to the "Cold War" policy and colonialist policies are still expanding military bases and piecing together aggressive blocs around the world, attempting to create tension and disaster everywhere. The American war forces still continue to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, and intensify their aggressive activities in the Taiwan area of our country. Recently, the United States, ignoring the opposition of the broad masses of people and the parliaments and governments of many countries, insisted on carrying out hydrogen bomb tests near the Marshall Islands, a trust territory. This is obviously completely incompatible with the spirit of disarmament. We resolutely oppose this behavior that endangers the interests of peace and infringes upon national sovereignty.
    The Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace believes that the struggle for national independence and the cause of safeguarding peace are closely related. We express our respect to the people of Asian, African and other countries who are fighting heroically against colonial enslavement and to safeguard the cause of peace. We warmly congratulate the independence of Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia. We sympathize with and support the struggle of the people of Algeria and other countries for national independence, and we wish them victory in advance.
    During the Stockholm meeting, representatives from Asian and African countries held a symposium. All participants unanimously expressed their willingness to further strengthen friendly exchanges and unity and cooperation with each other based on the "Bandung Spirit," and to work together to safeguard and consolidate peace in the Asian-African region. Undoubtedly, this is of great significance to the cause of world peace. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Asian and African people in this regard to contribute their own strength, and actively support beneficial initiatives to hold gatherings under the above-mentioned noble purposes.
    The Chinese people, who advocate peaceful coexistence and international cooperation, have always supported disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, as well as the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace expresses the Chinese people's full support for the resolutions of the Special Meeting of the World Peace Council in Stockholm, responds to its call to strive for the early realization of universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and to strengthen international peace forces, and is willing to cooperate with the people of all countries to overcome various difficulties and obstacles and work together to achieve this goal. We firmly believe that all good people in the world will move forward more closely hand in hand, so that the cause of peace will win new victories.

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常委会扩大会议
    关于响应斯德哥尔摩世界和平理事会特别会议的号召的决议
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员会扩大会议满意地听取了，并且一致同意出席斯德哥尔摩世界和平理事会特别会议的中国代表团团长陈叔通关于会议的情况和成就的传达报告。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员会扩大会议祝贺斯德哥尔摩世界和平理事会特别会议的成功，认为这次会议所通过的各项决议表达了世界各国人民要求普遍裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器、要求加强和扩大和平力量的普遍愿望和共同意志。这些决议，将有助于进一步推进各国人民谋求持久和平和国际合作的事业。
    今天，全世界千百万爱好和平的人们，都迫切地希望看到引起战争恐惧和加重人民负担的军备竞赛很快结束，希望看到联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在伦敦会议上对于裁军问题尽早达成协议。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员会扩大会议认为有必要指出，一些死抱着“冷战”政策和殖民主义政策的人们还在世界各地扩张军事基地和拼凑侵略集团，企图到处制造紧张和灾难。美国战争势力仍继续阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，破坏日内瓦协议在越南的实施，并且在我国领土台湾地区加紧侵略活动。最近，美国无视广大人民和许多国家的议会和政府的反对，坚持要在托管地区马绍尔群岛附近举行氢弹试验。这显然是与裁军精神完全不相容的。我们坚决反对这种危害和平利益和侵犯民族主权的行为。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员会扩大会议认为，争取民族独立和保卫和平事业是有密切关联的。我们向为反对殖民主义奴役和保卫和平事业而英勇斗争的亚非各国和其他国家的人民表示敬意。我们热烈地祝贺苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯的独立。我们同情和支持阿尔及利亚和其他国家的人民为争取民族独立的斗争，并且预祝他们胜利。
    在斯德哥尔摩会议期间，亚非各国代表曾举行座谈。全体与会者都一致表示愿意根据“万隆精神”，进一步加强彼此间的友好来往和团结合作，共同为保卫和巩固亚非地区的和平而努力。无疑地，这对于世界和平事业是有重大的意义的。中国人民愿意在这方面同亚非人民一起努力贡献自己的力量，并且积极支持在上述崇高目的下举行聚会的有益倡议。
    主张和平共处和国际合作的中国人民，一向赞成裁军和禁止原子武器、氢武器以及和平利用原子能。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员会扩大会议表示中国人民全力支持斯德哥尔摩世界和平理事会特别会议的决议，响应它所提出的为争取早日实现普遍裁军和禁止原子武器、氢武器和为加强国际和平力量而斗争的号召，并且愿意同各国人民合作，克服各种困难和障碍，为达到这个目的而共同努力。我们深信，全世界一切善良的人们，定将更紧密地携手前进，使和平事业赢得新的胜利。
