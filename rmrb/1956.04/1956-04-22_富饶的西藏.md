Tibet is a vast and rich land on China's southwestern border, and the highest and largest plateau in the world, often called the "Roof of the World." It is inhabited by more than one million hard-working and intelligent people of Tibetan, Han, Hui, Mongolian and other ethnic groups.

The snow-capped Himalayas meander in the southwest of Tibet, and the peaks of the Gangdise Mountains, Tanggula Mountains and Karakoram Mountains stand in the north and central parts of Tibet.

Tibet is also the source of many major rivers in Asia. The famous Yarlung Zangbo River, Nujiang River and Lancang River all start from the grasslands in northern Tibet and flow southeast through the mountains. The Jinsha River, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, is the boundary between Tibet and Sichuan. The snow-covered mountains, rapid rivers and vast grasslands constitute the magnificent scenery of the plateau of our motherland.

The Qiangtang area in northern Tibet, covering an area of approximately 250,000 square kilometers, and the 39 tribes area, are the main pastoral areas of Tibet, where tens of millions of cattle and sheep graze. The meat, butter and fur needed by the Tibetan people are mainly supplied by these pastoral areas, and millions of catties of wool are also shipped out from the grasslands every year. The big sheep of Qiangtang can carry 40 catties of materials back and forth for thousands of miles and are a unique means of transportation in Tibet. In the past, animal plagues were a major disaster for the pastoral areas. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, veterinary hospitals, livestock clinics and animal disease prevention and control teams were established in the main towns near the pastoral areas, and mobile animal disease prevention and control organizations often worked in the pastoral areas. Qamdo Prefecture has also established a quarantine station and a 1,000-mile-long epidemic prevention zone to prevent and control livestock diseases for the herdsmen.

The Yarlung Zangbo River, Lancang River and Nujiang River have wide valley plains on both sides of the middle and lower reaches, and the climate is relatively warm. According to Tibetan classics, Tibetans began their agricultural life in Zedang, in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, before the Tang Dynasty. They fought for a long time against the floods of the rivers and the droughts of winter and spring, building dozens or hundreds of miles of canals, and drawing snow water from the towering mountains to irrigate the fields. Cold and drought-resistant highland barley, wheat, peas and rapeseed are produced here. The relatively warm Loyu area and Sangangquzong also produce rice and corn. Every year, thousands of tons of grain are transported from these agricultural areas to the major towns in Tibet, and the herdsmen on the grasslands of Tibet also go to these rural areas every year to exchange livestock products for food.

In the past, the lives of Tibetan farmers were very poor, and some farmers had to leave their land uncultivated because they had no seeds. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, they have received interest-free seed loans from the state for years. The farmers in Qamdo Prefecture have also received free iron farm tools. Some farmers have abandoned the wooden plows of the past and are using iron farm tools to cultivate the land and reclaim wasteland. Many abandoned lands have once again grown crops. The land reclamation and production of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the working personnel in Tibet have set an example for the Tibetan people. Tibet is a vast and sparsely populated area, and there are still large tracts of arable land along the rivers waiting to be reclaimed. The arable land in Quxu and on the shore of Yamdrok Lake alone is about one million mu. Agricultural experts who came to help the Tibetans have successfully cultivated many new crops on the plateau. Drought-resistant spring wheat and high-yield Soviet winter rye have been trial-planted on a large area this year. Cabbage, sweet potatoes and other vegetables that Tibet has never had before have begun to appear in the vegetable gardens of the Tibetans.

Tibet is a virgin land rich in minerals. According to preliminary surveys, there are more than 30 kinds of minerals with great economic value. There are iron and coal mines in the Tanggula Mountains at the junction of Qinghai and Tibet. Tibet is buried with a large amount of refractory materials such as graphite, asbestos, and soapstone, as well as building materials such as granite, black shale, and gypsum. In the past centuries, Tibet's underground resources had not been discovered. After liberation, the exploration team sent by the Ministry of Geology is now conducting exploration in the Tanggula Mountains.

The rivers in Tibet contain rich hydropower resources. According to estimates by the Tibet Engineering Survey Team, the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River alone can generate more than 62 million kilowatts of electricity.

Large primeval forests also grow in the Himalayan Mountains and the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, with precious Himalayan pine, spruce, Himalayan cypress and birch. The area of the primeval forest in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin is equivalent to one-third of the Daxinganling forest area in Northeast China. Peaches, apricots, bananas and pears and other fruits grow in the warm river valleys of Tibet.

The mountains and dense forests and vast grasslands of Tibet are home to herds of wild horses, wild cattle, wild sheep, bears, tigers, leopards, lynx, deer and other wild animals. They produce many precious furs, bear bile, deer antlers, tiger bones, musk, etc. The snow-capped mountains of the Himalayas produce a unique snow fish, which has been preliminarily identified as a precious kidney tonic medicine.

In the past, inconvenient transportation caused great suffering to the Tibetan people, and travelers have always regarded the Kang-Tibet dangerous road as a daunting task. Now, Tibet has two highway trunk lines, Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet, connected to Beijing. The Lhasa-Rikaze, Rikaze-Gyantse, and Gyantse-Yatung highways, which were built last year and this spring, have been opened to traffic in central Tibet. Yaks and mules are no longer the main means of transportation from Tibet to the mainland. The motherland is using a large number of vehicles to continuously transport materials to support Tibet's construction.

    富饶的西藏
    新华社记者  陈家璡
    西藏是中国西南边疆的一片辽阔富饶的土地，也是世界上最高最大的高原，一向被称为“世界屋脊”。这里居住着一百多万勤劳智慧的藏、汉、回、蒙古等民族人民。
    披冰带雪的喜马拉雅山蜿蜒在西藏的西南方，冈底斯山、唐古拉山和喀喇昆仑山山脉的群峰，耸立在西藏的北部和中部。
    西藏还是亚洲许多大河的发源地，著名的雅鲁藏布江、怒江和澜沧江，都是从西藏北部的草原上开始，穿过丛山峻岭流向东南方。长江的上源金沙江，是西藏和四川的分界线。常年积雪的山岭，湍急的河流和广阔的草原，构成了祖国高原的壮丽景色。
    西藏北部面积约二十五万平方公里的羌塘和三十九族地区，是西藏的主要牧区，这里放牧着上千万头牛羊。藏族人民所需要的肉类、酥油和毛皮，主要是由这些牧区供给，草原上每年还外运几百万斤羊毛。羌塘的大绵羊，能够驮载四十斤物资往返几千里路，是西藏特有的运输工具。从前，常流行在牧区的兽疫是牧民的大灾害，西藏和平解放后，临近牧区的各主要城镇都设立了兽医院、家畜门诊所和兽疫防治组，还常常有流动的兽疫防治机构到牧区工作。昌都地区还建立了检疫站和一条长达一千多里的防疫带，为牧民们防治牲畜的疫病。
    雅鲁藏布江、澜沧江和怒江中下游两岸，有着宽广的河谷平原，气候比较温暖。根据西藏经典的记载，唐代以前藏族人就在雅鲁藏布江中游的泽当一带开始了农业生活，他们和江河的泛滥和冬春的干旱作过长久的斗争，修筑了几十里、上百里的水渠，从高插云霄的山上引来雪水灌溉田地。这里出产耐寒耐旱的青稞、小麦、豌豆和菜子。气候比较温暖的洛瑜区和桑昂曲宗，还出产大米和玉米。这些农业区每年都有成千上万驮粮食运到西藏各主要城镇，西藏各个草原上的牧民每年也都要到这些农村里，用畜产品交换口粮。
    过去，西藏农民的生活非常贫困，有些农民因为没有种子不得不让土地荒芜。西藏和平解放后，他们连年得到国家的无息贷种，昌都地区的农民还得到了无偿铁质农具，有的农民已经丢掉了过去的木犁，用铁质农具耕地和开荒。许多荒废的土地，又重新生长庄稼。中国人民解放军和进藏工作人员的开荒生产，给藏族人民作出了榜样。西藏是一个地广人稀的地方，江河沿岸还有大片可耕地等待开垦，仅曲水一带和羊卓雍湖湖滨的可垦荒地就有一百万亩左右。前来帮助藏民的农业专家们，在高原上培植成功了很多种新的作物。耐旱的春小麦和高产量的苏联冬黑麦，今年已大面积试种。包心白菜、甘薯等十几种西藏从来没有的蔬菜，已开始出现在藏民的菜园里。
    西藏是矿藏丰富的处女地，根据初步勘察，就有三十多种极有经济价值的矿产。青藏交界处的唐古拉山区有铁矿、煤矿。西藏埋藏着大量的石墨、石棉、皂石等耐火材料，还有花岗石、黑色页岩、石膏等建筑材料。在过去的许多世纪里，西藏的地下资源还没有被人发现过。解放后，地质部派来的勘探队，现在正在唐古拉山区进行勘探。
    西藏的河流，蕴藏着丰富的水力资源。据西藏工程勘察队的估计，光是雅鲁藏布江中下游就可发出六千二百多万瓩的电力。
    喜马拉雅山区和雅鲁藏布江中下游，还生长着大片原始森林，有名贵的喜马拉雅松、云杉，还有喜马拉雅柏和白桦。雅鲁藏布江流域原始森林的面积，相当我国东北大兴安岭林区的三分之一。在西藏温暖的河谷地带，生长桃、杏、香蕉和梨等水果。
    西藏的丛山密林和宽阔的草原上，有着成群的野马、野牛、野羊和熊、虎、豹、猞猁、鹿等野兽，出产很多名贵的兽皮，熊胆、鹿茸、虎骨、麝香等，喜马拉雅山终年不化的雪山上，出产特有的雪鱼，经初步鉴定，是一种珍贵的补肾药品。
    从前，交通不便给藏族人民造成了很大的痛苦，旅人们也一向把康藏险道视为畏途。现在，西藏已经有康藏、青藏两条公路干线和北京联系起来，去年和今年春天先后建成的拉（萨）日（喀则）、日（喀则）江（孜）、江（孜）亚（东）公路，已经贯通西藏的中部，牦牛和骡马不再是西藏到内地的主要运输工具了，祖国正在用大批汽车源源不断地运去支援西藏建设的物资。
