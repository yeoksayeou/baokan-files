Promote Advanced Experiences and Universally Improve Labor Efficiency
By our reporter Li Ce

The local state-owned Chongqing Third Construction Engineering Company initially determined that its annual task for January would be double that of last year. However, the labor force did not increase, and none of the 132 requested cadres could be transferred. However, thanks to the company's leaders actively promoting advanced experiences, many difficulties were finally resolved.

In December of last year, Yang Changshi, a bricklayer at the 302 construction site, created a mortar spreader to complete the plan ahead of schedule. Using this mortar spreader, one person could lay bricks and spread mortar at the same time, saving one mortar spreading worker. He also created the "mobile elevation line method," saving the auxiliary time of pulling a horizontal line every time a brick was laid. In this way, he broke the national construction industry's 1955 unified quota by 166%.

The administrative staff, Party organization, and trade union of the construction site did not pay attention to Yang Changshi's advanced deeds. They believed that this person usually liked to say strange things and was mischievous, and that he was a backward element. After the company's leaders learned about this, they criticized the relevant personnel at the construction site. When checking for right-leaning conservative thoughts, the company's management at all levels also focused on whether they supported the advanced. This made the staff at all levels clearly realize that only by supporting the advanced and promoting advanced experiences can the state plan be better completed.

Yang Changshi's advanced deeds have been valued. On January 7, he held a demonstration performance on the construction site, dispelling some people's belief that since Su Changyou created the double-handed slurry squeezing method, bricklayers should no longer think about finding tricks. Young worker Yang Changbin was inspired and wanted to manufacture a "hollow wall mortar spreader." After discussing it with several workers, he soon succeeded in the experiment, exceeding the quota by more than double. Yang Changshi and others also improved the brick joint brushing method, exceeding the quota four times. Ou Haiyun designed a "small pole," eliminating the "plumb line" time for brick pillar masonry. Deng Jixing imitated the "single brick wall mortar spreader," exceeding the quota more than twice.

Workers in other types of work, under the influence of Yang Changshi's creative spirit, also actively improved work efficiency. The carpenters decided to gradually change from manual operation to using simple mechanical operation. The group led by Jiang Binghui decided to realize this plan within half a year and increase work efficiency by 60%. The tenon machine and drilling machine designed by Jiang Binghui, and the punching machine designed by Wang Xiangcheng, have all been assembled. They are designing a "feeding machine."

Bricklayers and carpenters have improved efficiency, and in order to change the situation where one explosion could only open two or three cubic meters of stone, earth and stone workers decided to implement medium and large-scale blasting in the suburban areas. It has now been successfully tested. On March 9, the group led by Zhang Wenjun at the 304 construction site used this method to blast more than 70 cubic meters of stone in one shot.

Learning advanced experiences and mastering advanced tools has become the common aspiration of the broad masses. Based on this situation, the company put forward a comprehensive plan for promoting advanced experiences this year at the end of January, and handed it over to engineering and technical personnel and workers for repeated study, determining to promote 41 advanced experiences and 138 advanced tools in eleven types of work. All advanced tools are manufactured uniformly by the company, light ones are kept by the groups, and major ones are allocated uniformly by the company. The workers were very excited when they received the advanced tools. Some people said: In the past, we were always asked to promote advanced experiences, but what could we use to promote them? Now that we have tools, we are really strong and well-equipped. In February, more than 90% of the workers in the company's five construction sites in the urban area had learned advanced experiences. 71% of the workers, due to the use of advanced tools, exceeded the quota by an average of 116.94%.

In February, the advanced experience promotion working group, jointly organized by the production technology, materials, and trade union departments, systematically summarized the various advanced experiences of bricklayers and compiled a set of operating procedures for universal promotion. Now the working group is systematically summarizing the experiences of other types of work. Advanced producers in various types of work have established technical research groups to jointly study and improve the operating methods and improved tools of their respective types of work. The punching machine designed by carpenter Wang Xiangcheng was designed alone for two years before, but it still had problems; now, with the help of the advanced experience research group, it was quickly successfully trial-produced, which can increase efficiency twenty times.

### 推广先进经验，普遍提高劳动效率

    推广先进经验，普遍提高劳动效率
    本报记者　李策
    地方国营重庆第三建筑工程公司，在一月份初步确定的全年任务比去年的增长了一倍。但是劳动力没有增加，要求增加的132个干部，一个也调不来。但是，由于公司的领导人员，积极推广先进经验，终于解决了很多困难。
    去年十二月，302工地砌砖工人杨长诗，为了提前完成计划，创造了单人使用铺灰器。使用这个铺灰器一个人可以一边砌砖，一边铺灰，节省一个铺灰工。他又创造了“活动升线法”，节省了每砌一?砖拉一次水平线的辅助时间。这样，他突破了全国建筑业1955年统一定额的166％。
    工地的行政管理人员、党组织和工会都不重视杨长诗的先进事迹。他们认为这个人平时好说怪话、调皮，说他是个落后分子。公司领导人员知道这件事以后，批评了工地的有关人员。公司各级管理人员在检查右倾保守思想的时候，也以是否支持先进作为检查的重点。这才使各级工作人员明确认识只有支持先进，推广先进经验，才能更好地完成国家计划。
    杨长诗的先进事迹受到重视了。一月七日，他在工地上举行了示范表演，打破了一些人以为自从苏长有创造双手挤浆法以后，砌砖工人别再想找窍门的想法。青年工人杨长斌得到了启发，想制造一付“空斗墙铺灰器”，他跟几个工人研究以后，不久就试验成功了，突破定额一倍以上。杨长诗等还改进了刷砖缝方法，突破定额四倍。欧海云设计了“小型线杆”，省去了砌砖柱的“吊线”时间。邓吉星仿制了“单砖墙铺灰器”，突破定额二倍以上。
    其他工种的工人也在杨长诗创造精神的影响下，积极提高工作效率。木工们决定把手工操作逐步改为使用简单机械操作。蒋炳辉领导的小组决定在半年以内实现这个计划，提高工效60％。蒋炳辉设计的推榫机、钻眼机，王向成设计的打眼机，都装配起来了。他们正在设计一部“推料机”。
    砌砖工、木工都提高效率了，土石方工人为了改变放一炮只能开二、三立方公尺石头的状况，决定在市郊区实行中型、大型爆破。现在已经实验成功。三月九日，304工地张文俊领导的小组采用这种办法，一炮炸开七十多立方公尺石头。
    学习先进经验，掌握先进工具，已经变成广大群众的共同愿望。公司根据这种情况，在一月底提出了今年推广先进经验的全面规划，交给工程技术人员和工人反复研究，确定在十一个工种内，推广四十一种先进经验、138种先进工具。全部先进工具由公司统一制造，轻便的交给小组保管，重大的由公司统一调拨。工人们接到先进工具，非常兴奋。有人说：过去老是叫我们推广先进经验，拿什么推呢？现在有了工具，真是兵强马壮了。二月份，在公司市区内的五个工地，已经有90％以上的工人学习了先进经验。有71％的工人由于使用了先进工具，平均突破定额116.94％。
    二月份，由生产技术、材料、工会三个部门共同组织的推广先进经验工作组，系统地总结了砖工的各种先进经验，并且编成了一套操作规程，普遍推广。现在工作组正系统总结其它工种的经验。各工种的先进生产者成立了技术研究小组，共同研究改进本工种的操作方法和改良工具等问题。木工王向成设计的打眼机，以前单独设计了两年，还是有毛病；现在得到先进经验研究组的帮助，很快就试制成功了，可以提高效率二十倍。
