Visiting Liujiaxia
　　Yan Shugui

　　Near Liujiaxia, from Tangwangchuan in the east to Luojiawan in the west, from Sigouxia in the south to Hongliutai in the north, red and white flags are planted on many hilltops within an area of more than 200 square kilometers. Groups of surveyors, holding measuring tapes, are bending over and climbing towards the high and steep cliffs, carefully observing and recording the nature of the valley rocks and the geological structure. Excavation workers are busily digging horizontal tunnels. At the dam axes of Taohekou and Hongliugou, workers have erected drilling rigs over the turbulent Yellow River to conduct core drilling. These are geological surveyors selecting a dam site for the Liujiaxia Reservoir.

　　In order to establish a hydroelectric hub in Liujiaxia, the former Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee sent people here multiple times in 1952-1953 to investigate and understand the terrain and geological conditions, and began surveying the dam site area, reservoir area, and spillway area, as well as conducting socio-economic surveys. In April 1954, the Yellow River Survey Team, including Soviet experts, came to Liujiaxia again and decided to establish a huge hydroelectric hub project here. Last May, Soviet experts came here and finally decided to conduct geological drilling in the four comparative dam site areas of Maliugou, Suzhouya, Taohekou, and Hongliugou in order to select the most economical and best dam site. From then on, large-scale dam site selection work began. This project will commence construction after the Sanmenxia Hydroelectric Hub is completed. Now, the staff are working hard on surveying and mapping, striving to submit the data required for the first stage of the preliminary design in the shortest possible time.

　　The Maliugou Mountain, Gaoxieshan Mountain, Bami Mountain, Ningkadi Mountain, Gaodazui Mountain, and Houbei Mountain near Liujiaxia are all over 1,900 meters above sea level, and some are so steep that even mountain goats cannot pass. Many cliffs standing on both sides of the Yellow River are as straight as if they were cut with a knife, and the roaring Yellow River rushes under the cliffs. In order to understand the nature of the rocks on both sides of the river valley, geological personnel hang rope ladders on the steep walls of one hundred and dozens of meters high, and then step down the rope ladder, climbing a section, working for a while and then climbing again, until they reach a place close to the river surface. Sometimes the rope ladder is suspended in mid-air and rotates, so they grab the rope and wait for the rope ladder to fix before working. Several horizontal tunnels on the construction site are halfway up the cliffs, and before entering the tunnel, a sidewalk leading to the tunnel entrance must be built on the rock. Workers are suspended from the mountain with ropes, and after stepping on the rock, they use steel drills to make blast holes. The rapid river water brings many difficulties to core drilling in the river. Engineering designers and bridge builders have erected several steel wire rope bridges without piers on the Yellow River, erected drilling platforms on the steel wire ropes, and then put the drilling rigs on them.

　　In the struggle against difficulties, the workers have given full play to their initiative. Surveyors completed the 1:2000 topographic map of the dam site area fourteen days ahead of schedule. Geologists completed the geological cross-sectional survey of each dam site ahead of schedule. Drilling workers used Soviet experience to increase the drilling speed by 30%-40%. Water pressure tests also increased the work efficiency by 40%-50% due to the technical staff's improved working methods. (Attached picture)

    访问刘家峡
    燕树桂
    在刘家峡附近，从东边的唐汪川到西边的罗家川，从南边的寺沟峡到北边的红柳台，二百多平方公里面积内的许多山头上，都插上了红白旗子。一组一组的测量人员，拿着标尺，弯着身子，爬向高陡的崖头，仔细观察和记录着河谷岩石的性质和地质的构造。开挖工人正在紧张地开挖平峒。在洮河口、红柳沟两个坝轴线上，工人在波涛汹涌的黄河中心上空架上了钻机，进行河心钻探。这是地质勘测人员正在为刘家峡水库选择坝址。
    为了在刘家峡建立水力枢纽，1952—1953年，原燃料工业部和黄河水利委员会，便多次派人来这里查勘，了解地形地质的情况，并且开始坝址区、水库区、溢洪区的测量和社会经济调查。1954年4月，包括苏联专家在内的黄河查勘团又来到刘家峡，决定在这里建立巨大的水力枢纽工程。去年五月，苏联专家来这里，最后决定在马六沟、苏州崖、洮河口、红柳沟四个比较坝址区进行地质钻探，以便从中选择一个最经济、最优良的坝址。从此，大规模的选坝工作便开始了。这个工程将在三门峡水力枢纽施工后着手兴建。现在，职工们正在紧张进行勘测，争取在最短时间内交出初步设计第一阶段所需要的资料。
    刘家峡附近的马六沟大山、高斜山、巴米山、宁卡底山、高大嘴山、后备山等，拔海都在一千九百公尺以上，而且有的很陡，连山羊都过不去。黄河两岸屹立的许多削壁，笔直得像用刀子切的一样，削壁底下奔腾着叫嚣的黄河。地质人员为了了解河谷两岸岩石的性质，便在一百几十公尺高的陡壁上挂上软梯，然后踏着软梯向下爬，爬一节，工作一会儿再爬，一直爬到接近河面的地方。有时候软梯悬在半空，旋转起来，他们就抓住绳索，等到软梯固定后才工作。工地上有几个平峒是在削壁的半中腰，进峒之前得在岩石上修一条通向峒口的人行道。工人们用绳子从山上吊下来，脚蹬着岩石后，再用钢钎打炮眼。急速的河水为河心钻孔带来很多困难。工程设计人员和架桥工人，在黄河上架设了几座没有桥墩的钢丝软桥，在钢丝绳上架上钻台，然后把钻机放上去。
    工人在跟困难作斗争中，发挥了高度的积极性。测量人员提早十四天完成了二千分之一的坝址区地形图。地质人员提前完成了各坝址地质横断面测绘工作。钻探工运用苏联经验，钻进速度提高了30％—40％。压水试验也由于技术人员们改进了工作方法，工作效率提高了40％—50％。（附图片）
