    How the Red Star Cooperative Quickly Established Work Norms
    Zhang Zongyin
    To do a good job of labor management in agricultural production cooperatives, the central link is to establish and use work norms. Agricultural production cooperatives have many types of work and complex conditions, and establishing and using work norms does require a lot of meticulous work. However, some comrades regard this work as overly difficult and mysterious. When they see the work norm tables of some old cooperatives with so many items and so many numbers, they feel a bit dizzy. In fact, this work is not as difficult as they imagine. As long as you go deep into reality, deep into the masses, understand the actual situation, closely rely on the masses, and humbly and enthusiastically learn production knowledge from the masses and work experience from the old cooperatives, it is not too difficult to do this work well. The experience of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hejian County, Hebei Province, fully proves this.
    When the Red Star Cooperative Management Committee formulated and added work norms in the spring of 1955 and this spring, it hired six or seven experienced old farmers. For example, Cui Zhijiang, one of them, was a seventy-year-old veteran long-term worker who had worked for the big landlord Feng Guozhang for more than forty years; Yang Wenhua was also an old long-term worker who had worked for more than thirty years. They have done all kinds of farm work hundreds or thousands of times; they all have rich experience. The work norms for certain farm work were formulated by hiring people who were experts in that area. To formulate the norms for picking cotton and pruning cotton, experienced women were hired; to formulate the norms for various types of construction work, bricklayers were hired. For some farm work that had not been done in the past, such as the peanut vine pressing and cotton phosphorus spraying implemented in 1955, several loyal and reliable activists were found to test work at the same time, and the work norms were set based on the results of the one-day experiment of several people. Using these methods, the draft of the work norms was set and distributed to each team, and all members were mobilized to repeatedly discuss it. After concentrating everyone's experience to revise and supplement it, and then approving it by the members' representative meeting, it could be used. The 731 work norms currently used by the Red Star Cooperative were formulated in this way.
    Is it better to have more or fewer items in the work norms? Generally speaking, it is easier to use if there are more items in the work norms. For example, pulling wheat has the distinction between dry land and irrigated land; if only one work norm is formulated, it can only be used in one type of land, but not in the other, or it cannot be used in both types of land. Work norms are not afraid of being numerous, but of being chaotic. Even if there are more, as long as the items are clearly defined and an index (a brief classification catalog) is made, it is easy to use. For example, to check the norm for pulling wheat, you can first find the various types of summer work in the agricultural harvesting category in the index, and after finding it, you can quickly find it on the "Work Norm Table" according to the page number and number indicated in the index. The accountants of the Red Star Cooperative felt it difficult to check when there were few norms at the beginning, because the items were not clearly defined and the arrangement was not appropriate; now that there are more norm items, they feel that it is easier to check than before, because the items are clearly defined, the arrangement is appropriate, and there is a classification catalog.
    Most of the farm work in agricultural cooperatives can implement piecework in labor remuneration and can formulate work norms. Before 1954, people in the Red Star Cooperative believed that the work in the pear orchard could only be calculated by day and not by piece. Everyone thought: each mu of pear trees has ten or so trees, fifteen or sixteen trees, and even a few trees; there are big trees and small trees; there are trees with complete crowns and broken trees; what can be used as the unit of "piece"? Starting in the spring of 1955, after long-term deliberation and repeated discussions by the members, pear trees can now not only be contracted by the piece, but also contracted for production. Pear trees are divided into five grades according to the size of the tree and whether the crown is complete or not. Saplings are divided into two grades. The grade is marked on the sunny side of each tree by scraping the tender skin. The third grade of mature trees is used as the middle grade tree, and all grades of trees are converted into middle grade trees. The orchard industry is not calculated by mu, but completely by middle grade trees as the standard for calculating "pieces." The Red Star Cooperative Orchard has formulated 343 work norms. Now, only very few farm work in the whole cooperative is contracted by time. For example, temporary labor is used to watch the threshing ground during the day to ensure that the grain piled in the field is not stolen, eaten by chickens, or disturbed by dogs, with every ten hours watched as one work norm.
    With work norms, it is easier to formulate work remuneration standards. Classify and rank all work norms in agriculture, orchard, animal husbandry, sideline industries, etc., and unify them into several grades according to the conditions of the work's lightness, technical strength, busy and slack farming seasons, importance, cleanliness, etc., after horizontal and vertical comparison between the same grade and between different grades, and each grade stipulates a certain number of work points, which is the remuneration standard.
  (The Red Star Cooperative stipulated nine grades this year. Having more grades in the remuneration standard makes it easier to be reasonable; but it is not necessary to be too complicated.) With the remuneration standard, it is also easy to calculate work remuneration. Divide the amount stipulated by the work norm by the work done by the laborer in one day, and then multiply by the work points stipulated by the remuneration standard. The resulting number is the work points that the laborer should get that day. For example, for hoeing late corn, hoeing 1.4 mu of land in a distant field and meeting the specified quality standard is one work norm; according to the remuneration standard, this is a third-grade job, and each work norm should get ten work points. Suppose this member hoeed 2.1 mu of land in one day, he should get fifteen work points. The formula is as follows:
      (2.1÷1.4)×10＝15
      Production is constantly developing, experience is constantly enriched, and it is not easy to formulate work norms completely and accurately in one go; even if they are accurately set, they still have to be changed later when everyone's labor efficiency is improved. This doesn't matter, it can be revised and supplemented at a certain period. At the end of 1955, the Red Star Cooperative expanded, the content of production became more complicated, and the original work norms and remuneration standards were not enough. The original work norms and remuneration standards were reviewed, supplemented, and revised. The work norms increased from 238 items to 731 items; the remuneration standard changed from seven grades to nine grades. In each production season, if each team finds that the original work norms and remuneration standards need to be revised and supplemented, they can report to the Management Committee at any time, which will immediately draft opinions on revision and supplementation after investigation and research, and use them after approval according to the original democratic procedures for formulating work norms.
    Formulating work norms requires some meticulous work; however, after doing so, it is much easier to implement the contract system and formulate labor day expenditure plans and labor force use plans. The Red Star Cooperative contracts work in this way: The first step is to divide the types of crops. The second step is to calculate the number of work points used for each type of crop. (First, according to the technical measures of each crop, based on the spirit of fine processing, determine how many procedures are needed for the whole year, and then calculate the number of work points used for each procedure per mu according to the work norms and remuneration standards; add up the number of work points used for each procedure per mu, and then multiply by the total number of mu to calculate the total number of work points used for this crop by the whole cooperative.) The third step is to multiply the number of work points used per mu of each crop by the number of mu of this crop allocated to each team to calculate the number of work points each team should get to complete the contracted task. According to the Management Committee's fifteen-day production task and the specific situation of the team at that time, the fifteen days are divided into three small segments, and a contracting plan for each small segment is made. According to the work norms and remuneration standards, it can be calculated how many work points should be given to each group, and contracted to each group separately. The groups can also contract some work that can be done individually by the members to the members according to the work norms and remuneration standards.

    红星社是怎样迅速制定工作定额的
    张宗荫
    要把农业生产合作社的劳动管理工作做好，中心环节是制定和运用工作定额。农业生产合作社的工作种类繁多、条件复杂，制定和运用工作定额的确要做许多细致的工作。可是，有些同志把这个工作看得过分困难、神秘了，看到一些老社的工作定额表上有那样多的项目、那么多的数目字，就觉得有些头昏眼花。其实，这个工作并不像他们想像的那么难做。只要深入实际、深入群众，了解实际情况，紧紧依靠群众，虚心地热心地向群众学习生产知识，向老社学习工作经验，这个工作要做好也不太难。河北省河间县红星农业生产合作社的经验完全证明了这一点。
    红星社管理委员会在1955年春天和今年春天制定和增定工作定额的时候，聘请了六、七个富有经验的老农。如其中的崔志江，是过去给大经营地主冯国璋扛活领人四十多年的七十多岁的老长工；杨文华也是一连扛过三十多年长活的老长工。他们对各种农活，做过几百次或是几千次；他们都有丰富的经验。某些农活的工作定额，是聘请在那方面内行的人制定的。制定摘棉花和棉花整枝的定额，聘请了经验丰富的妇女；制定盖房的各类活的定额，聘请了瓦匠师傅。对有些过去没做过的农活，如1955年实行花生压蔓和棉花喷磷，就找了几个忠实可靠的积极分子同时试工，根据几个人一天的试验结果，把工作定额规定出来了。采用这几种方法，把工作定额的草案定出来，发给各队，发动全体社员反复讨论。集中大家的经验修正补充之后，再经过社员代表大会批准，就可以使用了。红星社现在用的731项工作定额，就是这样制定的。
    工作定额定的项目多一些好，还是少一些好？一般地说，工作定额的项目比较多一些才便于使用。例如拔麦子，本来有旱地和水浇地的分别；假如只制定一个工作定额，那就只能在一种地用，在另一种地不能用，或是在两种地上都不能用。工作定额不怕多，就怕乱。即便是多一些，只要是项目分明，并且做个索引（简明的分类目录），使用起来也很简便。例如，要查拔麦子的定额，可先在索引上找农业收割类夏季的各类活，找到以后，按索引上注明的页数和号数，很快就可以在“工作定额表”上查到。红星社各队的会计员，在最初定额少的时候觉得难查，那是因为项目不分明，排列不适当；现在定额项目多了，倒觉得比以前好查了，原因就是项目分明，排列恰当，而且有了分类目录。
    农业合作社的绝大部分农活都能实行劳动报酬上的计件制，都能制定出工作定额。红星社在1954年以前，人们都认为梨树园的活，只能按日计工，不能按件。大家认为：每亩梨树，有十来棵的，有十五六棵的，甚至也有几棵的；有大树，有小树；有枝帽齐全的树，有破树；拿什么做“件”的单位呢？从1955年春开始，经过社员们长期酝酿，反复讨论，现在对于梨树不但能按件包工，而且能包产了。梨树是按树棵大小和树冠齐不齐，大树分成五等，幼树分成二等，在每棵树的阳面，刮出嫩皮号上等级，以成树的三等树作为中等棵，各等树一律折成中等棵。果园业不按亩计算，完全按中等棵作为计“件”的标准。红星社果园已经制定了343项工作定额。现在，全社只有极个别的农活按时间包工。如由附带劳动力白天看场，保证场里堆的粮食不被人偷、鸡吃、狗捣，每看十小时为一个工作定额。
    有了工作定额，制定工作报酬标准就比较容易了。把农业、果园、畜牧、副业等各业所有的工作定额进行分类排队，根据活的轻重、技术性强弱、农忙农闲、重要程度、脏净等条件，经过一等之间及等和等之间的横竖评比，统一划分为若干等级，各等规定一定的工分，这就是报酬标准。
  （红星社今年规定了九等。报酬标准等级多一些，比较容易做到合理；但是过于烦琐也不必要。）有了报酬标准，计算工作报酬也就容易了。用工作定额规定的数量，除劳动者一天作的活，再用报酬标准规定的工分乘，得出来的数，就是这个劳动者当天应该得的工分。如锄晚玉米，在远地锄一亩四分地，达到规定的质量标准，就是一个工作定额；按报酬标准规定，这是三等工，每个工作定额应得十分工。假定这个社员一天锄了二亩一分地，他应该得到十五分工。算式如下：
      （2.1÷1.4）×10＝15
      生产是不断发展的，经验是不断丰富的，工作定额一次不容易制定得很完整、很精确；即使定得精确了，以后大家的劳动效率提高了也还是要变动。这不要紧，可以在一定时期修正补充。1955年年底，红星社扩大了，生产内容更加复杂，原来的工作定额和报酬标准不够使用了，就审查、补充和修订了原来的工作定额和报酬标准。工作定额由238项增加到731项；报酬标准由七等改为九等。在各个生产季节中，各队如果发现原来的工作定额和报酬标准需要修正补充，可以随时报告给管理委员会，由它即刻经过调查研究迅速起草修正和补充的意见，按照原来制定工作定额的民主程序经过批准后使用。
    制定工作定额是要做一些细致的工作的；可是，这样做了以后，实行包工制和制定劳动日支出计划、劳动力使用计划就方便得多了。红星社是这样包工的：第一步，把各种作物的类别划分好。第二步，计算各类作物每一种所用的工分数。（先根据每种农作物的技术措施，本着加工细作的精神，确定全年共需要多少道工序，再把各项工序逐项地根据工作定额及报酬标准，计算出每亩地每道工序用的工分数；把每亩地每道工序用的工分数加起来，再用总亩数乘，就可以计算出全社这种作物的总共用的工分数。）第三步，用各种作物每亩地用的工分数乘各队所分的这种作物的亩数，就可以计算出各队完成包工任务应得的工分数。各队根据管委会布置的十五天生产任务和本队当时的具体情况，把十五天分成三小段，作出每小段的包工计划，依据工作定额和报酬标准，就可以计算出应该给各组多少工分，分别包给各组。小组也可以按工作定额和报酬标准，把一些可以个人单独做的工作包给社员。
