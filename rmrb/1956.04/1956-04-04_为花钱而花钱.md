Spending Money for the Sake of Spending Money
    Huang Zhiguo

    On the afternoon of December 28th last year, I was rushing to organize the year-end summary materials when a correspondent ran in and said, "There's an urgent phone call for you in the reception room!" I ran to the reception room and picked up the receiver:
    "Hello?" I asked.
    "This is the General Affairs Office of Luoyang No. 1 Junior High School, are you...?"
    "City Construction Committee, what can I do for you?"
    "We want to buy ten mu of land to use as a botanical garden."
    "Haven't you already been allocated seven mu of state-owned land for a botanical garden? Didn't you receive the official document? Why do you want to buy ten mu more?"
    "We received the document, but..." the other party stammered, not saying anything.
    "Isn't seven mu enough?" I asked again.
    "No... oh, yes, it's not enough." The other party was clearly a bit flustered.
    "Why do you want to buy ten mu of land? Please explain in detail," I pressed further.
    "It's because—well, we have some money to spend," the other party hesitated for a long time and finally answered with this sentence.
    "To spend money?" I really couldn't believe my ears. I asked again twice, and after confirming that I hadn't misheard, I asked the other party to carefully explain the situation.
    The other party seemed nervous and flustered because I kept asking questions, but they had to answer, possibly because this comrade was afraid of failing to complete the task assigned by the higher authorities, so they finally replied:
    "The situation is like this, we are also in a difficult position. A few days ago, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education allocated 600 yuan to us, asking us to spend it within the year. We felt that buying seven mu of land could accomplish the task of spending this money, and land for botanical experiments is indeed needed. Who knew that you allocated us state-owned land, which only cost tens of yuan, and now the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education requires us to spend this money within the year. But today is already December 28th, and doing anything else... is too late."
    "That's outrageous!" A comrade next to me, who had probably heard our conversation on the phone, said angrily.
    I couldn't think of a better response at the time, so I said to the other party:
    "We can call the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education."
    "No! No! There's no need! Comrade, please don't..." I didn't pay attention to him and put the phone down.
    As soon as I put down the phone, the comrades in the reception room (who had obviously heard our conversation on the phone) started discussing it. One comrade seemed to know a lot about this kind of situation and said, "This kind of thing is not new, many units have it. If the money isn't spent, the higher authorities will criticize you!" Before he finished speaking, another plump comrade chimed in:
    "The first quarter is tight, the second quarter is tighter, the third quarter loosens up, and the fourth quarter is a big spending spree. This is the rule..."
    Another comrade with a Hunan accent continued, "Yes, some of our comrades in charge of money have a principle: it's better to overestimate and underspend than to underestimate and overspend. They rack their brains to ask the higher authorities for money, and if they can't spend it all, they are reluctant to hand it back, so they buy electric fans in winter and stoves in summer..."
    Because the year-end summary materials were still waiting for me to organize, I went back to the office without finishing listening to their discussion. But after I finished organizing the summary materials, I thought about this matter again, and I felt that this kind of thing was indeed not an isolated case, and it was necessary to submit it to the newspaper for public criticism, so I found a few comrades to discuss it together. After I talked about the phone call just now, Xiao Liu jumped up and said:
    "There's really such a thing? This must be severely criticized!"
    "It won't work! You might get yourself into trouble..." Lao Li said slowly.
    "What? What do you mean by that?" Xiao Liu asked with his eyes wide open, dissatisfied.
    "Don't you know, the units under our City Construction Committee system also have this kind of thing, they also have money they can't spend."
    "What? We also have this kind of thing?"
    "Didn't our office also send Lao Gao and me to Tianjin, Qingdao, Shenyang... last year to complete the task of spending money?" Technician Wang interjected.
    "What's going on! The criticism is coming to our own heads," Xiao Liu said angrily.
    "Good! Then we will examine ourselves together with others," Section Chief Wang of the General Affairs Section said, "However, this kind of thing is not uncommon, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau couldn't spend their money, so they bought bicycles, the best ones, spending, spending! But they still didn't spend it all! The Deputy Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau even criticized the General Affairs Section, saying, 'If you are told to spend, then spend!' It is said that not spending money can't keep up with social development and is 'Rightist and conservative.' One unit even held a reception, inviting many guests, also to spend money."

    "Was this surplus all spent?"
    "Not even two mao was left!" Wei Qimei

    为花钱而花钱
    黄志国
    去年十二月二十八日下午，我正在赶着整理年终总结材料，通讯员跑进来说：“接待室有你的紧急电话！”我跑到接待室，拿起了听筒：
    “哪里？”我问。
    “洛阳市第一初级中学校总务处，你是……？”
    “城市建设委员会，有什么事情请你跟我谈吧。”
    “我们要买十亩地作植物园用。”
    “不是已经给你们拨了七亩国有地作植物园用吗？你们没接到公文吗？为什么又要买十亩呢？”
    “公文收到了，可是……”对方支支吾吾地没说出来。
    “七亩地不够用吗？”我又问。
    “不是……哦，是是，是不够用。”对方显然有点慌乱了。
    “到底为什么又要买十亩地呢？请详细谈一下吧。”我又追问了一句。
    “为的是——那个，有一笔钱要花出去。”对方踌躇了半天，好容易回答了这么一句。
    “为了花钱？”我真不敢相信自己的耳朵了。我又追问了两遍，确实证明我没有听错之后，我就要求对方把情况认真地介绍一下。
    对方因我一再地发问，似乎显得紧张而又发慌，但是又不得不回答，也可能是这位同志怕完不成上级交给的任务，所以他终于回答了：
    “情况是这样的，我们也很为难，前些天市文教局拨来六百元，要我们在年内花出去。我们觉得买七亩地可以完成花这笔钱的任务，植物实验用地也的确是需要的。谁知道你们拨给我们的是国有土地，只花出去几十元，现在市文教局要我们年内一定把这笔钱花出去。可是今天已经是十二月二十八号，办别的……来不及。”
    “真是岂有此理！”旁边一位同志大概是听见了我们在电话中的交谈，很气愤地说了一句。
    我当时却没有想出更好的回答，只好跟对方说：
    “我们可以向市文教局打个电话。”
    “不能！不能！没有必要！同志，千万……。”我没有管他，把电话耳机放下了。
    我把电话耳机刚一放下，接待室里的同志（显然他们大致听清了我们在电话里的谈话）就议论开了。有一位同志好像很知道这方面的情况，说：“这种事不新鲜，好多单位都有。钱花不出去，上级还要批评呢！”他还没讲完，另一个胖子接住说：
    “一季度扣，二季度紧，三季度松，四季度大撒手。这是规律……。”
    另一个带有湖南口音的同志，接下去说：“是啊，咱们有些管钱的同志，他们的原则是：宽打窄用总比窄打宽用好。他们费尽心机想尽办法向上级要钱，花不完，又舍不得把钱交回去，于是冬天就买电扇，夏天就买火炉……”
    因为年终总结材料还等着我去整理，所以我没有听完他们的议论就回办公室了。但是当我整理完总结材料以后，我又想起这件事，我觉得这类事情的确不是个别的，有向报纸投稿公开批评的必要，于是就找了几位同志来一起商量。当我把方才打电话的事情谈了之后，小刘首先跳起来说：
    “真有这样的事？这得狠狠地批评！”
    “不行吧！弄不好自己也惹一身骚……”老李慢吞吞地说。
    “什么？你这话是什么意思？”小刘两眼睛瞪的溜圆，不满地问道。
    “你不知道，咱们城市建设委员会系统所属的单位也有这种事情，也是有钱花不出去。”
    “什么？我们也有这种事情？”
    “去年我们机关不是也派我和老高到天津、青岛、沈阳……去完成花钱任务吗？”王技术员插了一句。
    “怎么搞的！批评到咱们自己头上来了。”小刘生气地说。
    “好！那我们就同人家一块检讨好了。”总务科王科长说：“不过，这类事情可也不算少，市公共事业局钱花不出去就买自行车，买最好的，花呀，花！也还是没花完！市公安局副局长还批评总务科说，叫你花你就花！据说有钱不花还是赶不上社会的发展，‘右倾保守哩’。有一个单位还举行什么招待会，大请其客，也是为的花钱。”（附图片）
    “这笔结余都花完了吗？” 
    “连两毛钱都没有让它剩下！”韦启美
