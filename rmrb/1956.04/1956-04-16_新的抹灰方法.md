    New Plastering Method
    On April 14th, at a building outside Fuchengmen in Beijing where the structural engineering had just been completed, members of the Cui Maolin plastering shock brigade used a new plastering method - double filling and leveling plastering. In the past, wall plaster required three coats, with a thickness of 1.7 centimeters, which often resulted in the plaster not solidifying properly, leading to quality problems such as plaster falling off, bulging, and cracking. The new plastering method only requires two coats, with a thickness requirement of no more than 5 millimeters. This ensures the quality of the plastering and increases production efficiency by 10%.
    This plastering method was proposed by Engineer Mu Jikang of the First Work Zone of the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    新的抹灰方法
    四月十四日，在北京阜成门外一幢刚完成结构工程的楼房里，崔茂林抹灰突击队队员采用了一种新的抹灰方法——双填平抹灰法抹灰。过去，墙面灰需要抹三道，灰的厚度达一公分七厘，因而灰浆常常凝结不好，发生掉灰、起鼓、裂缝等质量事故。新的抹灰方法，只要抹两道就行了，厚度要求不超过五公厘。这样就保证了抹灰的质量，生产效率提高了10％。
    这种抹灰方法，是北京市第四建筑工程公司第一工区穆冀康工程师提出的。　（据新华社讯）
