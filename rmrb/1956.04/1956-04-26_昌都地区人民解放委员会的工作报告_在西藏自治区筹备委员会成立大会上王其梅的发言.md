    Comrade Deputy Premier Chen, Presidium, esteemed members, friends, and comrades,
    I extend my heartfelt congratulations on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. With boundless excitement, I participate in this conference of profound historical significance for Tibet. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region signifies the common will and aspiration of the Tibetan people, and it will undoubtedly shoulder the great task of leading all the people of Tibet in completing the construction of a prosperous and happy new Tibet.
    After the liberation of Changdu Area, in accordance with the resolution of the Central People's Government and based on the demands of the people of Changdu Area, a People's Representative Conference of the entire area was convened, and the People's Liberation Committee of Changdu Area was established. Subsequently, the first and second administrative offices were established in the thirty-nine tribes and Bomi Area, respectively, along with the People's Liberation Committees in twenty-eight zong—a political structure. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the policies of national equality and religious freedom have been implemented. At the first People's Representative Conference of the area, the exemption of all grain and money owed to the government by the people before 1949 was approved, and the corvée labor system of government requisitions from the people was abolished, which won the support of the broad masses of the Tibetan people. The historical estrangement between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and the disunity within the Tibetan nationality have been greatly improved. During the construction of the Kangzang Highway, nearly 200,000 livestock were mobilized, completing a transportation task of approximately 680,000 loads. Approximately 3 million catties of qingke barley, butter, and meat were purchased, gloriously completing the great task of supporting the People's Liberation Army in the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The people of Changdu Area have fulfilled their glorious responsibility in the work of building Tibet, consolidating national defense, and constructing the motherland.
    Currently, 44 members are participating in the People's Liberation Committees at all levels in Changdu Area, of which Tibetan members account for over 95%. A total of 443 Tibetan cadres are participating in various tasks. They have played a significant role in the development of political, economic, cultural and other undertakings in Changdu Area, laying a preliminary foundation for realizing the right of ethnic minorities to be masters of their own affairs.
    In developing agricultural and pastoral production, the government encouraged land reclamation and production, provided guidance to the masses in building water conservancy projects, and issued a total of 1.4 million catties of qingke barley and 98,000 silver dollars in interest-free seed and grain loans. The central government distributed 57,000 pieces of agricultural and pastoral tools free of charge, totaling 150,000 silver dollars. More than 20,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, which can increase grain production by more than 100,000 dan per year. At the same time, pastureland in pastoral areas has been protected, and pastureland disputes have been mediated. Public grain was reduced or exempted and relief was provided to disaster-stricken agricultural and pastoral areas based on the severity of the disaster. These measures have had a certain impact and promotion effect on the production of the masses. In 1952, the central government sent a veterinary epidemic prevention team, established the Changdu Area Veterinary Prevention Hospital and five animal husbandry and veterinary stations. A total of 300,000 head of livestock were inspected for epidemics, vaccinated, and treated for animal diseases, which greatly reduced the mortality rate of livestock and gradually increased the reproduction rate, playing a significant role in the development of animal husbandry.
    According to the resolution of the People's Liberation Committee of Changdu Area on developing the economy, industry and commerce have been vigorously developed. The number of stores has increased fivefold, commercial capital has increased sixfold, and domestic merchandise now accounts for the majority of sales in the market. State-owned trading companies have vigorously carried out the work of purchasing local and special products. In 1955, the purchase of local and special products increased by 60% compared with 1954, and the prices of four major products such as wool increased by nearly double compared with 1952. In 1955, the mixed circulation of Renminbi and silver dollars was implemented, strengthening economic ties with the motherland and solving the needs of economic development. At present, the construction of Changdu, Zhamu and other places has developed from small to large, from nothing to something, towards the standardization of new-type cities, changing the original old appearance.
    Cultural and health undertakings have also developed significantly. Eleven primary schools have been established in the area, with 488 students. The Changdu Primary School is under construction to become a complete primary school, and a senior primary class was newly added in 1955. A total of more than 220,000 people in the area participated in festival gatherings, broadcasts, seminars, exhibitions, winter schools, propaganda teams, and film performances, which universally improved the people's patriotic ideology and political awareness.
    The Central People's Government cares about the health of the Tibetan people, and sent a national health work team in 1952. At present, nine health centers and one people's hospital have been established in the area, and 61 Tibetan primary health workers have been trained. A total of more than 430,000 person-times have been provided with preventive vaccinations, disease inspections, treatment, and midwifery services. All medical expenses for Tibetan people are free of charge, reducing the pain of diseases for the Tibetan people, promoting the people's health, and winning the support of the broad masses of the Tibetan people.
    In terms of financial revenue in Changdu Area, in addition to the small amount of agricultural, pastoral, and commercial taxes used for the construction of Changdu Area, the financial deficit in previous years has reached more than 50% to 60%, all relying on subsidies from the central government. The Tibetan people of Changdu Area have deeply experienced that only in the unified big family of the motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, can the Tibetan areas be built well and move towards a bright future. The Tibetan people of Changdu Area have boundless love for our great motherland, for the Chinese Communist Party, and for Chairman Mao.
    In the past five years, we have also made many shortcomings and mistakes in our work. The main ones are that some Han cadres still have varying degrees of great-Han chauvinism, lack sufficient respect for the powers of Tibetan cadres, and lack patient assistance. They are also unable to work well based on the specific social conditions of the local area, and deviations often occur in the implementation of policies, resulting in impatience. Some Tibetan cadres also have localist tendencies in their thinking, showing narrow-mindedness and conservatism, unwillingness to learn new things, and lack a correct understanding of the prospects for the construction of Tibet. We are making our best efforts to correct and overcome these shortcomings and mistakes.
    In the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, we will unite with the people of all strata in Tibet, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, be modest and prudent, follow the direction pointed out by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and make greater efforts to continue to consolidate the unification of our great motherland, strengthen unity among all nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality, prepare for the establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region, and work together with the people of all nationalities in the motherland to build our country into a prosperous and happy socialist society!

    昌都地区人民解放委员会的工作报告
    在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上王其梅的发言
    陈副总理、主席团、各位委员、各位朋友、各位同志：
    我首先衷心地祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，我以无限兴奋的心情，参加这次西藏转入具有历史重大意义的会议。西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，它标志西藏人民共同的意志和愿望，它必将担负起领导全西藏人民完成建设繁荣幸福的新西藏的伟大任务。
    昌都地区解放后，遵照中央人民政府的决议并根据昌都地区人民的要求，召开了全区人民代表会议，成立了昌都地区人民解放委员会，随后相继在三十九族和波密地区建立了第一、第二两办事处及二十八个宗的人民解放委员会这一政权组织。五年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，实现了民族平等、宗教信仰自由的政策，在全区第一届人民代表会议上，通过豁免了1949年以前人民所欠政府的全部粮款，废除了政府向人民支乌拉的差役制度，获得了广大藏族人民的拥护。历史上遗留下来的藏汉民族隔阂和藏族内部的不团结关系，已有了很大的改善。在建筑康藏公路的期间，动员了近二十万头牲畜，完成了运输任务约六十八万驮，采购青稞、酥油、肉类等约三百余万斤，光荣地完成了支援人民解放军和平解放西藏的伟大任务。昌都地区人民在建设西藏、巩固国防、建设祖国的工作中，尽到了自己光荣的责任。
    昌都地区现在参加各级人民解放委员会工作的有委员四十四人，其中藏族委员占到95％以上，参加各种工作的藏族干部共443人。他们对发展昌都地区的政治、经济、文化等事业方面起了重大的作用，对实现少数民族当家作主的权利奠定了初步基础。
    在发展农牧业生产上，由于政府奖励开荒生产，指导群众兴修水利，发放了无息贷种贷粮共计一百四十万斤青稞和九万八千银元，中央无偿发放农牧工具五万七千件，共合十五万银元。开垦荒地两万多?，每年可增加粮食产量十万余?。同时保护牧区草场，并调解了草场纠纷，对受灾的农牧区域，根据灾情轻重不同的情况进行了减免公粮和救济。这些措施对群众生产上均起了一定的影响和推动作用。1952年中央派来兽疫防治大队，建立了昌都地区兽防医院和五个畜牧兽医工作站，共进行疫病检验、预防注射和兽病治疗三十万头次，使牲畜死亡率大大减少，繁殖率逐渐提高，对畜牧业的发展起到了重大的作用。
    根据昌都地区人民解放委员会关于发展经济的决议，大力地发展了工商贸易。商店增加了五倍，商业资金增加到六倍，国产百货已占市场销货量的大部分。国营贸易公司大力开展了收购土特产品的工作，1955年收购土特产品比1954年增加了60％，羊毛等四种主要产品的价格比1952年提高了将近一倍。1955年实行了人民币和银元混合流通，加强了同祖国的经济联系，解决了经济发展上的需要。目前昌都、扎木等地的建设已从小到大，从无到有，向新型城市的规范发展，改变了原有的旧面貌。
    文化卫生事业也有了显著的发展。全区已创办小学十一所，学生488人，昌都小学正在修建完全小学的校舍，并于1955年新增设了高小班。全区参加节日集会、广播、座谈会、展览、举办冬学、宣传队和电影演出的共约二十二万多人，普遍地提高了人民的爱国主义思想和政治觉悟。
    中央人民政府关怀藏族人民的身体健康，于1952年派来了民族卫生工作大队，现全区已建立九个卫生院、所和一个人民医院，并培养了藏族初级卫生员六十一人，进行预防接种、疾病检验、治疗和妇产接生等共计四十三万多人次，所有藏族就诊的医药全部免费，减少了藏族人民疾病痛苦，增进了人民身体健康，获得了广大藏族人民的拥护。
    昌都地区财政岁入方面，除少数的仅有的农牧商税收用于昌都地区建设事业外，历年来的财政赤字都达到50％至60％以上，均依靠中央给以补贴。昌都地区的藏族人民已深刻体验到只有在统一的祖国大家庭内，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，才能把藏族地区建设好，走向美好的将来。昌都地区的藏族人民对我们伟大的祖国，对中国共产党和毛主席有着无限的热爱。
    五年来，我们在工作中也产生过不少的缺点和错误，主要的是在一部分汉族干部中还存在着不同程度的大民族主义思想残余，对藏族干部的职权尊重不够和缺乏耐心的帮助，还不能够很好的根据当地社会具体情况来进行工作，执行政策中常常发生一些偏差，产生急躁情绪。也有一部分藏族干部在思想上还存在有地方主义的倾向，表现狭隘保守，不愿学习新事物，对西藏建设的远景缺乏正确的认识。对这些缺点和错误，我们正在以最大努力来纠正和克服着。
    今后我们在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、西藏自治区筹备委员会和中共西藏工委的领导下，同西藏各阶层人民团结一致，戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，遵循着中华人民共和国宪法所指引的方向，为继续巩固我们伟大祖国的统一、加强各民族间的团结及藏族内部的团结、为筹备成立统一的西藏自治区而加倍努力，并同祖国各族人民一道为把我国建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗！
