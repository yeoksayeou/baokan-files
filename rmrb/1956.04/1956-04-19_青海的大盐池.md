Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Shijin and Yang Changming reported: The salt from the Chaka Salt Lake in Qinghai Province can supply the entire nation of 600 million people for over 160 years. This is the information we recently obtained during a visit to the exploration team of the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry at the Chaka Salt Lake.

　　The Chaka Salt Lake is located four kilometers south of the Chaka Station on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, covering an area of about 104 square kilometers. The surface of the salt lake has a layer of dark gray "salt crust" that is more than three inches thick. Workers can produce an average of five to six thousand catties of salt per person per day. The produced salt is stored in the open air on the shore of the salt lake like small hills.

　　The brine in this salt lake is very concentrated. After salt is extracted, a lot of salt will crystallize again in two or three years. The brine also contains 3.5% potassium salt. This potassium salt can be used to manufacture fertilizers, potassium chlorate, potassium hydroxide, and other products.

　　Near the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, 90 kilometers from the Chaka Salt Lake, there is also the Keke Salt Lake, which has one-third more reserves than the Chaka Salt Lake. And the Charhan Salt Lake, located more than 40 kilometers north of Golmud, an important town on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, has salt reserves that can supply the people of the entire country for about 8,000 years.

    青海的大盐池
    新华社记者王世晋、杨昌明报道：青海省茶卡盐池的盐，可以供全国六亿人吃一百六十多年。这是我们最近在茶卡盐池访问轻工业部盐务总局勘探队时候所得到的材料。
    茶卡盐池在青藏公路茶卡车站以南四公里的地方，它的面积约有一百零四平方公里。盐池的表面有一层三寸多厚的暗灰色的“盐盖”。工人们每人每天平均可以生产五、六千斤盐。生产出来的盐像小山一样地露天贮存在盐池岸旁。
    这个盐池的卤水很浓，采过盐的地方，经过两三年又会结出很多盐来。卤水中还含有3.5％的钾盐。这种钾盐可以制造肥料，和氯酸钾、氢氧化钾等。
    在青藏公路附近，距茶卡盐池九十公里的地方，还有个柯柯盐池，它的储藏量比茶卡盐池还大三分之一；而在青藏公路重镇——格尔穆以北四十多公里的察尔汗盐池，所贮藏的盐大约可供全国人民吃八千多年。　（据新华社讯）
