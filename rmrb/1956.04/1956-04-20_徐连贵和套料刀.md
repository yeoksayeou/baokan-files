    Xu Liangui and the Trepanning Tool
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun

    Xu Liangui had to pass by an open space every time he went from the workshop to a trade union meeting. On one side of the open space was a warehouse, neatly piled with steel of various colors and types; on the other side was a place for stacking scrap iron filings, piled up like a small mountain.
    This is a common scene that can be seen in any machine factory. These iron filings are all cut from good steel. Xu Liangui, an old worker at the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, had to consider this every time he passed by: How can good steel not be wasted in vain? Take the rock drills processed in our mechanical assembly workshop, for example, only a surface layer is needed; the material core, as big as a hot water bottle, is casually drilled into powder by the drill bit! When the material is put in, it weighs 21 kilograms, but when it comes out, it only weighs seven kilograms. This means that the result of everyone's hard work is that two-thirds of the steel turns into waste shavings. How can this not be heartbreaking?
    Xu Liangui was thinking about it every day, trying to find a solution, and later finally saw a kind of trepanning tool, also called a hollow drill, in Soviet materials. This kind of tool can completely cut out the material core. Later, he also saw the performance of the trepanning tool at the Northeast Region Cutting Performance Conference. This is indeed a good thing for saving steel. From then on, Xu Liangui became interested in trepanning tools.
    In November 1953, Xu Liangui had almost finished studying how to use the trepanning tool. At this time, the factory organized a high-speed cutting performance meeting, and Xu Liangui was also asked to demonstrate the trepanning tool in the processing of air cylinders. The large hexagonal lathe turned rapidly, and strips of white iron filings shot straight out, and the inner core of the air cylinder was indeed completely cut out. The cut-out material core was like an iron shovel handle, which was really rare!
    The trepanning tool aroused great interest, so the leadership decided to let Xu Liangui and the large hexagonal lathe operator Wang Zhenlong continue to study it.
    But problems also followed: because this kind of tool is made of high-speed steel, the steel is soft and easily damaged. Sometimes it has to be sharpened after cutting one or two materials, six or seven times a day; others cannot master the sharpening technology and have to rely on Xu Liangui himself. Xu Liangui was too busy just sharpening knives all day long. At the same time, this kind of knife cannot be driven fast, and the efficiency cannot be improved. After three months of persistence, it could not be sustained.
    Although it was a failure, Xu Liangui found an important lesson: Why have so many factories shouted about trepanning tools, but no factory has ever been heard of using it for mass production? The reason is that trepanning tools made of high-speed steel are only suitable for use on slow-turning large parts; to use trepanning tools for mass production, it is necessary to solve the problems of speed and wear resistance.
    Xu Liangui began to try to make trepanning tools with cemented carbide steel. But when the first cemented carbide steel trepanning tool was about to be made, the rock drill that was being produced at that time was no longer being made, and the tool could not be used, so the matter had to be put aside. At this time, Xu Liangui had been promoted to workshop technician.
    As time passed, the research on trepanning tools had long been forgotten by many people. But Xu Liangui still considered it from time to time, and took out the cemented carbide steel knife to ponder whenever he had time.
    1954 slipped away. Before returning home, Soviet expert K. Yanshensky, who had been concerned about the trepanning tool experiment, made strict criticisms of the factory leaders' attitude towards the trepanning tool experiment. He said: "Factory leaders must adopt an enthusiastic and serious attitude towards a new creation and a new experiment. When they first saw the trepanning tool, they were very interested, but they let go as soon as they encountered a problem. This is not the attitude that a leader should take."
    The problem of the trepanning tool was raised again.
    Xu Liangui went to the factory's rationalization proposal office to find technician Zhan Yubai. Zhan Yubai happily said that the factory director had asked him to help research the trepanning tool.
    Xu Liangui and Zhan Yubai studied for four months before the cemented carbide steel trepanning tool made some progress. In that experiment in early August, the tool went in normally, and the steel shavings came out very well. A steel material with a diameter of 4.5 cm and a length of 25 cm was smoothly cut out. But although the material was cut out, the tool was scrapped, and the work was scrapped. It turned out that the tool head was going down diagonally, getting bigger and bigger, and it became a strange shape with one end small and the other end big. What was going on?
    Zhan Yubai rushed over, and after taking a look at the iron filings and the cut-out material, he happily said: "Lao Xu, this time we have found the key. Don't think that the tool and the work are scrapped, but the value of this experiment is very great. It proves that it is entirely possible to make trepanning tools with cemented carbide steel. The reason for the scrap is just that the tool head still has some shortcomings."
    They planned to finally complete the experiment of the trepanning tool when the ЛГ—45 type rock drill was put into production in early September.
    On the morning of September 3, Xu Liangui took the trepanning tool to find Wang Zhenlong. In the southern part of the factory building, there was a brand-new Soviet-style large hexagonal lathe, and Wang Zhenlong was sharpening the tool head in preparation.
    "How long will it take you to sharpen it?" Xu Liangui asked.
    Wang Zhenlong said: "About half an hour."
    "That's fine, I'll try the trepanning tool while you sharpen the knife."
    Just as he was talking, the Soviet section chief came over.
    "Why are you trying the trepanning tool again?" he said. "Lao Wang! Let me tell you, production time cannot be used for experiments. If you do experiments, who will be responsible for affecting the production task?"
    Xu Liangui knew that this was being said to him, so he interjected and said: "Lao Wang is sharpening the knife, what task can it affect? Is this how you, the section chief, support new things?"
    The old Su was furious and called the chief foreman. When the chief foreman came, he still had to let the experiment be carried out.
    People surrounded the large hexagonal lathe, and the experiment began. The trepanning tool pierced into the cylinder body, and the cut iron filings shot out along the tool groove. The iron filings came out normally, and the cylinder body was also in good condition. At this time, Wang Zhenlong had sharpened the knife and was about to start production, so the experiment had to be stopped.
    As soon as the day shift was over, Xu Liangui got on the lathe again and tried three times in a row, all of which were very good, but there were still some minor problems to be improved.
    The experiment was carried out again at eleven o'clock that night, and thirteen jobs were done in four hours, all of which were done quickly and well. The trepanning tool was completely successfully tested!
    In the morning, the people on the day shift came to work. As soon as the Su section chief entered the workshop, he saw many people surrounding Wang Zhenlong's machine tool, curiously looking at the large pile of work done with the trepanning tool. Some picked up the shiny cut steel material and discussed: "It's really good. In the past, this three-kilogram steel material would have been cut into powder, but this time it's completely cut out. That's great, what can this material be used for?"
    "What can't such thick steel material be used for? Making the nut on the blocking valve screw rod..."
    The Su section chief asked, and it turned out that the trepanning tool had been successful. Not only could it save steel material, but also, it originally took eleven minutes to do one, but now it only takes eight minutes.
    On September 4, Xu Liangui did another twenty-four jobs in one day shift.
    The factory director and the general branch secretary both came. Xu Liangui told them: After becoming proficient in using the trepanning tool, one shift can do forty, while the highest product using a drill bit is only nineteen.
    Everyone was very excited when they heard this. Factory Director Zhang Chen said humorously: "Once the trepanning tool is used, the scrap iron recovery rate may not be able to complete the plan!"
    Everyone laughed. (Attached picture)

    徐连贵和套料刀
    本报记者　金雨困
    徐连贵每次从车间去工会开会，总得经过一块空地。在空地的这一边有个库房，整整齐齐地堆放着各色各样的钢材；在空地的另一端有一个堆放废铁屑的场所，铁屑堆得像座小山般高。
    这是在任何机器工厂都能看到的普遍情景。这些铁屑都是从很好的钢材上切削下来的。徐连贵，这位沈阳风动工具厂的老工人，每次经过这里的时候却都要这样考虑：怎么样才能使好好的钢材不白白地浪费掉呢？就拿我们机械装配车间加工的凿岩机来说吧，需要的仅仅是一层表皮；像热水瓶那么大的料心，全叫钻头随随便便钻成了碎末！投料的时候，它还是二十一公斤重，出来时就只有七公斤了。这就是说，大家辛辛苦苦劳动的结果，却让三分之二的钢材变成了废屑，这怎么能够叫人不痛心呢？
    徐连贵天天在考虑，想办法，后来终于在苏联资料上，看到一种套料刀，又叫做空心钻头，用这种刀具就可以把料心完全套出来。以后他又在东北区切削表演大会上看到了套料刀的表演。这确是节约钢材的好东西。从此，徐连贵就对套料刀感起兴趣来了。
    1953年11月，徐连贵把套料刀的用法研究得差不多了。这时厂里组织了一次高速切削表演会，也叫徐连贵把套料刀在气缸加工中表演了一下。大六角车床飞快地转动，一条条白花花的铁屑直往外窜，气缸的里心真的完整地套下来了。套下的料心像铁锹把似的，真叫人稀罕！
    套料刀引起了人们极大的兴趣，于是领导方面决定让徐连贵和大六角车床的车工汪振隆继续研究下去。
    可是问题也随着来了：因为这种刀是用高速钢做的，钢软容易坏，有时套一两次料就得磨一回，一天就得六七次；别人掌握不了磨刀的技术，得由徐连贵自己来。徐连贵成天光磨刀还忙不过来。同时这种刀不能开快车，效率提不高，坚持了三个月，就坚持不下去了。
    虽然是失败了，徐连贵却找到一条重要的教训：为什么许多工厂都叫嚷过套料刀，却始终没有听说哪一个工厂把它用在大批生产上去呢？原因就在于高速钢做的套料刀，只适合在转动很慢的大件上使用；要使套料刀用于大批生产，就必须解决速度和耐磨的问题。
    徐连贵开始用硬质合金钢来试做套料刀。但是当第一把硬质合金钢的套料刀快做好的时候，当时生产的那种凿岩机已经不做了，刀也使不上了，事情只得搁下来，这时，徐连贵已经被提升为车间技术员了。
    日子长了，套料刀的研究早就被许多人遗忘了。但是徐连贵还不时考虑着它，一有空就把那把硬质合金钢的刀拿出来捉摸。
    1954年溜过去了。一直关心着套料刀试验的苏联专家克·杨申斯基归国前，对工厂领导人员对待套料刀试验的态度，提出了严格的批评。他说：“工厂领导者对一个新的创造，新的试验，必须采取热情严肃的态度。刚看到套料刀的时候兴趣满大，一遇到问题就撒手不管了。这不是领导者应采取的态度。”
    套料刀的问题又重新提出来了。
    徐连贵到厂的合理化建议室去找技术员战玉柏，战玉柏高兴地说，厂长已经要他专门来帮助研究套料刀。
    徐连贵和战玉柏两个人研究了四个月，硬质合金钢的套料刀才有了些头绪。在八月初那次试验中，刀进得很正常，钢屑也出得很好，直径4.5公分，长25公分的钢料顺顺当当地套下来了。但是料虽套下来了，刀却废了，活也废了。原来刀头是斜着下去的，越下越大，就成了一头小一头大的怪样子，这是怎么回事呢？
    战玉柏赶来了，一瞅这些铁屑和套下的料，就高兴地说：“老徐，这回可有了门了，你别看刀和活都废了，这次试验的价值却很大，它证明了硬质合金钢做套料刀是完全可能的。所以废的原因，只是刀头还有些缺点。”
    他们准备在九月初ЛГ—45型凿岩机投料生产的时候，最后完成套料刀的试验。
    九月三日清晨，徐连贵带了套料刀去找汪振隆。在厂房南部，有一部崭新的苏式大六角车床，汪振隆正在磨刀头做准备工作。
    “你得磨多长时间？”徐连贵问。
    汪振隆说：“半个来钟点吧。”
    “那行，我趁你磨刀的空来试试套料刀。”
    正说着，苏段长过来了。
    “怎么又要试套料刀了？”他说：“老汪！告诉你，生产时间不能试验，要试验，影响生产任务谁负责？”
    徐连贵知道这是说给自己听的，他插上来说：“老汪正在磨刀，能影响什么任务？你这位段长就是这样支持新事物的？”
    老苏气坏了，把总工长找了来，总工长来了还是得让试验。
    人们把大六角车床围住，试验开始了，套料刀刺刺地往缸体里钻，削下来的铁屑顺着刀槽直往外窜，铁屑出得很正常，缸体情况也很好。这时候汪振隆已磨好刀，马上要开始生产，试验只得停止了。
    白班一下班，徐连贵又上了车床，连试了三个，都很好，但还有些小毛病要改进。
    当天晚上十一点钟又试验起来，四个钟头内干了十三个活，都是干得又快又好。套料刀完全试验成功了！
    早晨，白班的人都来上班了，苏段长一进车间，就看见许多人围着汪振隆的机床，好奇地看着那一大堆用套料刀干的活，有的拿起亮晶晶的套下的钢料在议论：“真行，过去把这三公斤重的钢料削成碎末，这回整着套下来。太好了，这个料能干什么呢？”
    “这么粗的钢料干什么不行，做阻塞阀螺丝棒上的丝母……”
    苏段长一问，原来套料刀已经成功，不仅可以节约钢料，而且本来十一分钟干一个，现在只要八分钟就行了。
    九月四日，徐连贵一个白班又干了二十四个。
    厂长和总支书记都来了，徐连贵告诉他们：使用套料刀熟练以后，一个班就可干到四十个，而用钻头最高的产品不过十九个。
    大家听了都很兴奋，厂长张忱幽默地说：“一使用套料刀，铁屑回收率可完不成计划了！”
    大家都笑了。（附图片）
