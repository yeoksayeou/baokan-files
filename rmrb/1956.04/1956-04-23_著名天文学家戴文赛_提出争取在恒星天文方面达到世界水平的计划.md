    Renowned Astronomer Dai Wensai
    Proposes Plan to Strive for World-Class Status in Stellar Astronomy
    Renowned astronomer Dai Wensai, who was selected as a representative to the National Conference of Advanced Producers, recently proposed a plan to strive to reach the world's advanced level in one aspect of astronomy within five years.

    Dai Wensai is the Deputy Director of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at Nanjing University. He is currently conducting research on "Analysis of Stellar Radial Velocities." He plans to master knowledge in all aspects of world astronomy within two years, reach the world's advanced level in stellar astronomy within five years, and has formulated weekly and monthly study and work plans.

    In the past two years, Dai Wensai has completed research work such as "Changes in the Distance Between the Sun and the Observer Within a Day" and "Spatial Distribution of Be Stars." Last year, in conjunction with studying the documents of the Fourth Conference on Cosmogony of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, he wrote a paper on "The Significance of Unstable Star Research in Cosmogony." In February of this year, he also completed the research on "Spatial Motion of Be Stars," which was originally planned to be completed in May, three months ahead of schedule.

    著名天文学家戴文赛
    提出争取在恒星天文方面达到世界水平的计划
    被选为出席全国先进生产者代表会议代表的著名天文学家戴文赛，最近提出争取五年内在天文学一个方面达到世界先进水平。
    戴文赛是南京大学数学天文系副主任。他现在正在进行“恒星视线速度的分析”的研究工作。他准备在两年内掌握世界天文学方面的知识，五年内在恒星天文方面达到世界先进水平，并且作出了每周每月的学习和工作计划。
    戴文赛在最近两年来完成了“太阳和观测者距离在一日内的变化”、“B型发射星的空间分布”等研究工作，他在去年结合学习苏联科学院第四次天体演化学讨论会的文件，写了“不稳定星研究在天体演化学上的意义”的论文。今年二月，他又把计划在五月完成的“B型发射星的空间运动”的研究，提前三个月完成。
