The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions Propaganda Department recently organized grassroots cadres to exchange experiences in propaganda work during the advanced producer movement on two occasions. One was a meeting of grassroots propaganda cadres to exchange experiences from the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company Trade Union in holding advanced experience schools and technical performances, and the experience of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's Steelmaking Department in running blackboard newspapers. The other was the organization of eighty people, including propaganda cadres from thirteen industrial trade unions and seven district trade unions, as well as trade union propaganda committee members from more than twenty large factories and mines under their jurisdiction, to visit the propaganda work of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in the advanced producer movement. The blackboard newspapers, cartoons, competition charts, and other forms of propaganda in the steelmaking, coking, and other workshops of this factory were vivid and powerful.

Now, the Beijing First Machinery, Light Industry, and other industrial trade unions, as well as the Chongwen District and other district trade unions, have disseminated these experiences to their respective grassroots units. A technical performance organized by the First Automobile Parts Factory in early April promoted an advanced Soviet lathe tool method and two advanced experiences from its own factory.

    北京市交流先进生产者运动中宣传工作的经验
    北京市工会联合会宣传部最近在先进生产者运动中，两次组织基层干部交流了宣传工作的经验。一次是召开基层宣传干部会，交流了北京市汽车运输公司工会举办先进经验学校、技术表演的经验和石景山钢铁厂炼铁部办黑板报的经验；另一次是组织十三个产业工会和七个区工会的宣传干部和他们所属的二十多个大厂矿的工会宣传委员共八十人，参观了石景山钢铁厂在先进生产者运动中的宣传工作。这个厂炼铁、炼焦等车间的黑板报、漫画、竞赛图表等宣传形式，都生动有力。
    现在，北京市第一机械、轻工业等产业工会和崇文区等区工会已经把这些经验传播到所属各基层单位。第一汽车附件厂在四月初组织的一次技术表演，就推广了一种先进的苏联车刀法和两项本厂的先进经验。
