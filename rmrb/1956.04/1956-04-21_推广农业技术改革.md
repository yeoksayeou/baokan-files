    Dry-planted Rice Seedlings Grow Well
    The dry-planting method for rice seedlings has been successfully tested. A few days ago, members of the Longqiao First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, under the guidance of agricultural scientists sent by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture, planted a paddy field using the dry-planting method for rice seedlings. Now, the seedlings in this field have all turned green and are growing well.
    The dry-planting method for rice seedlings involves first plowing and harrowing the field thoroughly, applying base fertilizer, and then using a hoe to create shallow furrows two inches deep and six inches wide. A small bundle of transplanted seedlings (seedlings dug out from the nursery bed with soil) is placed every seven inches, leaning against the side of the furrow. When hoeing the second furrow, the soil turned up covers the roots of the first row of seedlings. Seedlings are placed in the second furrow in the same way. Seedlings planted in this manner are neat and uniform. After all the seedlings in the field are planted, water is released for irrigation and liquid manure is applied. Several groups of people can plant seedlings in a field simultaneously.
    According to agricultural scientists in Sichuan Province, the dry-planting method for rice seedlings is far superior to the direct dry-seeding method for rice. Because the seedlings are planted first and then irrigated, the soil's physical properties are good, the temperature is high, and the seedlings turn green quickly and grow well after planting. At the same time, the dry-planting method for rice seedlings simplifies the technology of planting rice in paddy fields, reduces labor intensity, and creates good conditions for the future adoption of machine planting.

    Planting Citrus on the Mountains
    Guangdong Province plans to plant citrus on the mountains on an area of more than 42,800 mu this year, which is about six times larger than the original area. Up to now, in the Shantou area, which produces the most citrus in the province, many new orchards have been opened along the Danan Mountain area in Chao'an and other counties, planting a total of more than 21,200 mu of citrus, with a survival rate generally above 90%.
    This year, the state has helped citrus farmers solve the problem of green manure needed for planting citrus on the mountains, and has helped more than 1,000 farmers learn advanced fruit tree cultivation techniques. (Xiao Juncheng)
    New Tea Tree Propagation Method
    Tea-producing areas in Fujian Province are using the latest "tea tree short-cutting propagation method" to propagate large quantities of excellent tea trees.
    The tea tree short-cutting propagation method involves cutting semi-lignified branches from the current year's growth of healthy, pest-free mother tea trees, one or two nodes, about one inch long, and inserting them into the soil to allow them to take root and survive. This propagation method results in faster rooting, more developed root systems, and a survival rate about 30% higher than the "layering" and "cutting" methods used in the past. It is also low in cost and easy to propagate in large quantities.

    Promoting Intercropping of Cotton and Wheat
    The cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi Province are promoting an advanced sowing method of intercropping cotton and wheat. Yongji and Jieyu counties, which started earlier, have already intercropped cotton in wheat ridges. It is estimated that more than 75,000 mu will be intercropped this year, which can increase the production of seed cotton by more than 1.65 million jin.
    Intercropping cotton and wheat is an advanced sowing method that Xue Bangke and Wang Xucai, members of the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongji County, have successfully tested continuously for the past two years. Last year, Xue Bangke's 1.3 mu of intercropped land yielded an average of 220 jin of seed cotton and 300 jin of wheat per mu, and the cotton was of good quality and long fiber.
    The method of intercropping cotton and wheat is very simple: just use a hoe to open a trench in the wheat ridge and sow cotton seeds when the wheat begins to head, and then pay attention to protecting the cotton seedlings when harvesting the wheat. In order to promote the growth of cotton seedlings in wheat ridges that lack sunlight, it is necessary to appropriately increase the base fertilizer and seed soaking and mixing, and to water and thin the seedlings in time.
    In the past, cotton-producing areas in southern Shanxi Province only grew single-season crops. In recent years, some areas have implemented cotton-wheat double cropping, but due to late sowing, the cotton yield was low and the quality was poor. After the promotion of cotton-wheat intercropping, the problem of cotton-wheat rotation can be correctly solved, and the land utilization rate and cotton-wheat yield can be increased. Now, various places are preparing to gradually promote it. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    推广农业技术改革
    旱栽的水稻秧苗长得很好
    水稻秧苗旱栽法已经试验成功。四川省新繁县龙桥第一农业生产合作社的社员，几天前在四川省农业厅派去的农学家指导下，用水稻秧苗旱栽法栽插了一块稻田。现在这块田里的秧苗已经全部转青，长得很好。
    水稻秧苗旱栽法是先把田犁好耙细，施上底肥，然后用锄头理一条深二寸宽六寸的小沟。每隔七寸放进一小束铲秧（从秧田里铲出带有泥土的秧苗），靠在小沟的壁上。当用锄头理第二条小沟的时候，翻起的泥土刚好掩盖在第一排秧苗的根上。第二条小沟内照样放下秧苗。这样插下的秧苗，整齐均匀。整块田的秧苗全插好后，便放水灌溉和施放水粪。一块田可以同时有三、四组人插秧。
    据四川省的农学家说，水稻秧苗旱栽法比水稻旱直播法优越得多。由于先栽秧，后灌水，田里的土壤物理性好，温度高，秧苗插上后转青快，生长好。同时，水稻秧苗旱栽法简化了水田栽秧的技术，可以减轻劳动强度，并且给今后采用机器插秧创造了良好条件。（新华社）
    把柑桔种到山上
    广东省今年计划柑桔上山的面积达到四万二千八百多亩，比原有上山面积大六倍左右。到现在为止，在全省出产柑桔最多的汕头专区的潮安等县沿大南山一带开辟了许多新的果园，共种植柑桔二万一千二百多亩，成活率一般在90％以上。
    国家今年帮助柑农解决了柑桔上山需要绿肥的问题，并帮助一千多农民学会了果树栽培的先进技术。（肖俊城）
    茶树的新育苗法
    福建省茶区正采用最新的“茶树短穗扦插法”大量繁育优良茶树。
    茶树短穗扦插法是从生长健壮、无病虫害的母本茶树上，剪取当年生半木质化的枝条一、二节约一寸多长，插入土中，让它生根成活。这种育苗法比过去各地采用“压条”、“扦插”等方法繁育的树苗，生根快，根群发达，成活率高30％左右，而且成本低，容易大量繁育。

    推广棉麦套种
    山西省晋南产棉区正在推广棉麦套种先进播种法。开始较早的永济和解虞两县已经在麦垅里套种棉花。预计全区今年套种七万五千多亩，共可增产籽棉一百六十五万多斤。
    棉麦套种是永济县幸福农业生产合作社社员薛榜科、王绪才在过去两年连续试种成功的一种先进播种法。去年薛榜科套种的一亩三分地平均每亩收了籽棉二百二十斤、小麦三百斤，而且棉花绒长质量好。
    实行棉麦套种的方法很简单：只要在小麦开始孕穗的时候，在麦垅里用锄开沟点棉种，然后在割麦时注意保护棉苗就行。为了促进棉苗在缺乏阳光的麦垅里生长，应该适当增加底肥和浸种拌种，并且要及时浇水和间苗。
    晋南产棉区过去都是单季作物。几年来有的地区实行了棉麦复播，但因播种晚，棉花产量低、质量差。推广棉麦套种后，就能正确解决棉麦轮作，提高土地利用率和棉麦产量。现在，各地正在准备逐步推广。（据新华社讯）
