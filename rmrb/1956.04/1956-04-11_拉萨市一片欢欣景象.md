Lhasa City, where the great joyous day is approaching, presents a scene of jubilation. A light snow has just fallen on the plains, and workers at various construction sites are still working hard and happily. A large auditorium, built to welcome the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, has already been erected in front of the Potala Palace, with red flags of labor emulation flying on the roof. On the dense construction scaffolding, workers are installing doors and windows and painting the walls.

    拉萨市一片欢欣景象
    大喜日即将来临的拉萨市，一片欢欣景象。平原上刚落过了一场小雪，各个建筑工地的工人仍在紧张愉快的工作着。为了迎接西藏自治区筹备委员会成立而赶修的一座大礼堂，已经在布达拉宫前面耸立起来，屋顶上飘着劳动竞赛的红旗。在那密密的建筑架上，工人们正在安装门窗和粉刷墙壁。为接待中央代表团修建的三幢楼房，已经有两幢基本完工，开始进行室内装置和油漆工作。
    罗布林卡到大昭寺的马路，正在铺修路面。市内八角街的道路和排水沟，都已经翻修完毕。围绕市区的林廓路，也正在由藏族民工加宽铺平。现在，拉萨有成千的藏族工人为西藏人民的大喜事赶工，出色的藏族画工，正在赶绘主席台和彩门上的图案。
    西藏各地的三百多个民间艺人即将会集拉萨。在拉萨的文工团、文工队，正连日赶排戏剧和西藏歌舞。各机关的工作人员赶制着献给中央代表团的彩花。拉萨市内的高大彩门架也开始陆续树立起来。
    这些天来，几百名藏、汉族工作人员，正在为迎接西藏自治区筹备委员会成立和中央代表团到达进行各项准备工作。四月五日，西藏自治区筹备委员会筹备处处长阿沛·阿旺晋美对准备工作进行了一次全面检查。
