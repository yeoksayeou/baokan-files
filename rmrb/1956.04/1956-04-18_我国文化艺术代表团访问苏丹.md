Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum: The Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation, led by head of the delegation, Burhan, arrived in Khartoum, the capital of the Republic of Sudan, by plane from Cairo on the morning of April 16.

On the same day, the acting Prime Minister of the Republic of Sudan and Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supply, Ibrahim Mufti, received Burhan, the head of the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation. Mufti welcomed the delegation's visit and believed that this visit would help realize the spirit of the Bandung Conference and strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between Asian and African countries.

Mufti and Burhan agreed that it was a very meaningful coincidence that the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation would hold its first performance in Khartoum on April 18, the first anniversary of the Bandung Conference. They hoped that the friendship between Sudan and China would be further enhanced.
