    New Products, New Creations
    Wang Zhiwei, an engineer at the Wuxi Machine Tool Factory, recently created a "rapid moisture meter." This meter can determine the moisture content of oil, alcohol, coal, sand, cotton, and various grains in four to ten minutes. The total weight of this meter is only three kilograms, making it easy to carry.
    Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments and shoe factories have recently designed a new batch of women's leather shoes. In addition to yellow and black leather shoes, there are also various inlaid leather shoes made of colored pigskin, such as red-inlaid-gray and gray-inlaid-sky blue. Currently, ten types of new-style women's semi-high-heeled leather shoes, including round-mouth, tongue-mouth, and strap styles, have been successfully trial-produced.
    The Jiangxi Lushan Hydropower Station Construction Committee successfully trial-produced a wooden propeller-type water turbine generator based on advanced Soviet experience and has begun supplying electricity. This is a small generator with only ten horsepower, simple in structure, and can be manufactured using local materials.
    The Local State-Owned Siping Oil and Wine Factory successfully trial-produced oil extraction using flax seeds. Experiments conducted in March proved that 23 jin of oil could be produced from every 100 jin of flax seeds.

    Correction
    In the article "Adopting a Two-Stage Design to Accelerate Construction Speed" on page two of this newspaper on March 29, the first paragraph: "The task of preliminary design is to correctly select the plant site" should read "Preliminary design is to further determine the correctness of the plant site selection"; in the third paragraph, "The design work took three years" should be followed by "before construction drawings began to be issued", and "The design work took only six months" should be followed by "before construction drawings began to be issued."

    新产品·新创造
    无锡机床厂工程师王之玮最近创造了一种“快速水份测定器”。这种测定器可以在四到十分钟的时间内测定出油料、酒精、煤炭、砂土、棉花和各种粮食的含水率。这种测定器总重量只有三公斤，便于携带。
    上海市国营商业部门和皮鞋厂最近新设计了一批女皮鞋。除黄色和黑色皮鞋以外，还有用彩色猪皮制成的红镶灰、灰镶天蓝等各种镶色皮鞋。现在，圆口式、舌口式、穿带式等十种半高跟的新式女皮鞋已经试制成功。
    江西省庐山水力发电站建站委员会根据苏联先进经验试制木制旋桨式水轮发电机成功，并且开始供电。这是一部只有十匹马力的小型发电机，构造简单，并且可就地取材制造。
    地方国营四平油酒制造厂试用线麻子榨油成功。在三月份进行的试验证明，每百斤线麻子可以出油二十三斤。更正
    三月二十九日本报二版“采用两阶段设计，加快建设速度”一文中的第一段：“初步设计的任务是正确地选择厂址”应为“初步设计是为了进一步判断厂址选择的正确性”；第三段“设计工作共花了三年”下面应加上“才开始发出施工图”，“设计工作只用半年时间”下面应加上“就开始发出施工图”。
