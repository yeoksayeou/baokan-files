Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: During the first quarter of this year, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country supplied farmers with over 330,000 double-wheeled double-moldboard plows and double-wheeled single-moldboard plows, an increase of more than three times compared to the actual supply in the first half of last year. In provinces such as Fujian, Guizhou, and Guangxi, over 85% of the plows supplied to farmers have already been used for this year's spring plowing.

Because supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives mostly sign pre-sale contracts or combined contracts, and because direct transportation services from factories to rural supply points have been established with transportation departments, a newly produced double-moldboard plow (or single-moldboard plow) can generally be transported to a rural supply point in just seven to fifteen days. This is a significant reduction in transportation time compared to last year, and it has also reduced circulation costs.

     第一季度供应农民三十多万部新铧犁
    新华社9日讯　全国各地供销合作社在今年第一季度里，供应到农民手里的双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁已经达到了三十三万多部，比去年上半年实际供应数增加三倍多。在福建、贵州、广西等省，供应到农民手里的犁，已经有85％以上用于今年的春耕。
    由于各地供销合作社和农业生产合作社多订有预售合同或结合合同，又由于和交通运输部门开办了从工厂到农村供应点的直接运输业务，因而一般只要七天到十五天的时间，就可以把一部新出厂的双铧犁（或单铧犁）运到农村供应点。这比去年运输时间缩短了很多，又降低了流转的费用。
