　　Many Central Government Organs Help Cadres Preparing for College Entrance Examinations with Remedial Studies

　　The remedial class jointly organized by the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education for young cadres preparing to apply for universities has started on the 9th. This remedial class is divided into two groups according to the cadres' choices: science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, and liberal arts, history, politics, and law. The two ministries stipulate that cadres who are preparing to apply will spend half a day each day off the job for remedial studies, and more than a dozen cadres are also employed as part-time teachers. More than forty cadres from the two ministries are participating in the remedial studies in preparation for applying.

　　Many central government organs have also begun to help young cadres preparing to apply for universities with remedial studies. More than forty administrative cadres from the Ministry of Heavy Industry (excluding directly affiliated bureaus) have requested to apply. The Ministry of Heavy Industry is organizing remedial classes, and cadres participating in the remedial studies plan to study half-time off the job in April and May. When approaching the application period in June, they are prepared to study full-time off the job if necessary. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has decided to send a group of cadres who want to apply for universities to Overseas Chinese Remedial School for remedial studies.

　　More than one hundred cadres from organs such as the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Construction Engineering are preparing to apply for universities. These organs are preparing to set up remedial schools or remedial classes. (Xinhua News Agency)

    许多中央机关帮助报考高等学校的干部补习功课
    高等教育部和教育部为准备报考高等学校的青年干部联合举办的补习班，已在九日开学。这个补习班按干部志愿分为理工农医和文史政法两个小组，两个部规定准备报考的干部每天用半天的时间脱产补习，还聘请了十多个干部兼任教师。两个部参加补习准备报考的干部共有四十多人。
    许多中央机关也开始帮助准备报考高等学校的青年干部补习功课。重工业部（不包括直属各局）已有四十多个行政干部要求报考。重工业部正在组织补习班，参加补习干部计划在四、五两月内半脱产学习。到六月接近报考时期，必要的时候还准备全部脱产学习。华侨事务委员会已决定将一批要求报考高等学校的干部，送到华侨补习学校补习。
    纺织工业部、铁道部和建筑工程部等机关准备报考高等学校的干部共有一百多人，这些机关正在筹备举办补习学校或补习班。　（新华社）
