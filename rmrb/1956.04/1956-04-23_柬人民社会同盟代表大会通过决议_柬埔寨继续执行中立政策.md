Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 22nd: According to foreign news agencies from Phnom Penh: The third national congress of the Cambodian People's Socialist Community, which began on April 21st, passed a resolution on the first day, deciding that Cambodia will continue to implement a neutral policy. The resolution also requested the Cambodian government to accept assistance from any party to help with the proposed economic development plan.

This decision was made after a speech by former Cambodian Prime Minister and Chairman of the People's Socialist Community, Prince Norodom Sihanouk. In his speech, Sihanouk said that the country's desire is to pursue "strict neutrality."

Sihanouk said, "Priority must be given to implementing a socialist program and achieving economic independence."

He said that Cambodia is ready to implement a two-year economic development plan, thanks to the promise of assistance from the United States, France, India, some Commonwealth countries, and new friends such as China, Poland, and the Soviet Union.

Sihanouk stated that Cambodia is willing to continue to accept military and economic assistance from the United States. He said, "This is necessary to prevent Cambodia from falling under communist influence." He also said, "The US Embassy in Phnom Penh has notified us that the United States will continue to provide assistance without requiring us to abandon our neutral policy."

Sihanouk also announced that the border between Thailand and Cambodia will soon be reopened, and Cambodia will soon begin negotiations with South Vietnam.

Sihanouk said that the Soviet Union and Poland have legally recognized Cambodia and will soon establish embassies in Phnom Penh.

Speaking of the domestic political situation, Sihanouk said that the opposition People's Party has suggested that all political parties establish a united front to defend the country's neutrality. Sihanouk said he rejected this suggestion.

    柬人民社会同盟代表大会通过决议
    柬埔寨继续执行中立政策
    新华社河内22日电  据外国通讯社金边消息：四月二十一日开始举行的柬埔寨人民社会同盟第三次全国代表大会，在第一天通过决议，决定柬埔寨继续执行中立政策。决议并且要求柬埔寨政府接受任何方面的援助，来协助进行正在拟议中的经济发展计划。
    这项决定是在前柬埔寨首相、人民社会同盟主席西哈努克亲王发表演说后作出的。西哈努克在演说中说，国家的愿望是奉行“严格的中立”。
    西哈努克说，“必须优先实现一项社会主义纲领和取得经济上的独立。”
    他说，由于美国、法国、印度、一些英联邦国家以及中国、波兰和苏联等新朋友答应给予援助，柬埔寨已经准备实施一项两年经济发展计划。
    西哈努克表示柬埔寨愿意继续接受美国的军事和经济援助。他说，“这是防止柬埔寨落入共产党影响之下所必需的”。他又说，“美国驻金边大使馆已经通知我们说，美国将继续给予援助，而不要求我们必须放弃我们的中立政策。”
    西哈努克还宣布，泰国和柬埔寨的边境即将重新开放，柬埔寨不久还将开始同南越进行谈判。
    西哈努克说，苏联和波兰已经在法律上承认柬埔寨，不久将在金边设立公使馆。
    西哈努克谈到国内的政治情况时说，反对党人民派已经建议一切政党建立一个联合阵线以保卫国家的中立。西哈努克表示拒绝这个建议。
