Xinhua News Agency, London, March 30th, via TASS: According to information obtained by local news sources, Soviet representative Gromyko presented a new proposal from the Soviet government regarding disarmament at the United Nations Disarmament Commission subcommittee meeting on March 27th.

As is known, on May 10, 1955, the Soviet government put forward proposals on disarmament, which created a practical and feasible basis for solving this important issue. Western countries did not accept these proposals, disagreeing with the prohibition of atomic weapons and the elimination of atomic weapons from national arsenals. Therefore, the entire disarmament issue – the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments – has long been in a stalemate.

The Soviet government, as before, is in favor of a complete and unconditional ban on nuclear weapons and their elimination from national arsenals. However, in order to break the deadlock in the entire disarmament issue and achieve constructive results, the Soviet government has put forward a new proposal, which does not stipulate that an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons must be reached before armed forces and conventional armaments can be reduced. This does not mean that the Soviet government believes it is impossible to reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. On the contrary, it intends to make every effort to constructively resolve this issue, which is of utmost importance for ensuring universal peace and security, in the near future.

It is reported that the Soviet's new plan advocates the conclusion of an international agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces, which will be conducive to the conclusion of an agreement on the prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons and the elimination of such weapons from national arsenals. According to the proposal, measures to limit and reduce conventional armaments and armed forces should be completed between 1956 and 1958.

The proposal stipulates that within the first three months after the agreement comes into effect, all countries should take measures not to increase their armed forces and conventional armaments beyond the level of December 31, 1955, and not to increase their appropriations for armed forces and armaments beyond the level of expenditure in this regard during the year ending December 31, 1955.

According to the same source, the Soviet plan stipulates that after the expiration of the above-mentioned three-month period, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China should begin to take measures to reduce their armed forces to one million to one million five hundred thousand, and Britain and France to six hundred and fifty thousand. Conventional armaments and national appropriations for armed forces and conventional armaments should also be reduced accordingly.

As for the extent to which other countries reduce their armaments and armed forces, this will be decided by an international conference on universal disarmament and reduction of armed forces. The level of armed forces in the aforementioned countries should not exceed 150,000 to 200,000.

The Soviet plan suggests that the funds freed up as a result of these measures should be used to improve the welfare of the people of the aforementioned countries and to provide assistance to economically backward countries. For this purpose, a special fund will be set up within the framework of the United Nations.

It is pointed out that the Soviet proposals enumerate the rights and powers of the international supervisory body to be established in order to effectively supervise the fulfillment of the obligations of all countries to reduce conventional armaments and armed forces, and that this body has sufficiently broad rights and powers to achieve such a purpose. To prevent a surprise attack by one country on another, the international supervisory body will establish monitoring stations on a mutual basis in major ports, railway junctions, highways, and airports within the territories of all relevant countries.

According to the Soviet's new proposals, this inspection system will be implemented fully and effectively, with the consent of the other relevant countries, for the armed forces and equipment owned by the signatory countries of this agreement outside their borders.

The international supervisory body will send permanent inspectors, selected on an international basis, to all signatory countries of the agreement. Within the scope of the supervisory functions they exercise, they will be able to freely access all supervised objects at any time. The objects of such supervision will be: military units; warehouses of military supplies and ammunition; land, sea, and air force bases; factories manufacturing conventional armaments and ammunition.

In addition, the Soviet proposals also suggest that at a certain stage of the implementation of the overall disarmament plan, on the condition that international trust is strengthened, the countries concerned will study the possibility of using aerial photography as a method of supervision.

The proposals also clearly stipulate other powers of the supervisory body. This body has the right to unimpeded access to materials on budget appropriations for military needs of the countries concerned, including all decisions of the legislative and executive bodies of each country on this issue. It will establish its own branches in the capitals of the participating countries of the agreement, and the tasks of these branches will include: maintaining contact with the government agencies of these countries, directing the work of monitoring stations and inspectors operating in the country's territory, and analyzing the information provided by each country.

The proposals also stipulate that in the event of a breach of the agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces, the international supervisory body should make recommendations to the Security Council on the measures to be taken to prevent and stop such breaches. Within one month after the establishment of the international supervisory body, the participating countries of the agreement shall provide this body with a complete official material, reporting on the situation of their armed forces, conventional armaments, and military expenditures.

It is worth noting that the Soviet proposals stipulate that the establishment of a region in Europe, including the territories of the two parts of Germany and countries adjacent to them, where armaments should be restricted and investigated, as an important measure to solve the disarmament issue. The countries concerned should stipulate in an agreement the maximum limit of the stationing of troops of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France on the territory of other countries in this region. The issue of this maximum limit should be discussed by the countries concerned. This agreement should prohibit the entry of atomic forces and the import of any kind of atomic and hydrogen weapons into the aforementioned region. In order to supervise the fulfillment of the obligation to restrict armaments on the territory in this region, a joint inspection of the armed forces and armaments of the participating countries of the agreement should be established.

Reporters pointed out that the Soviet proposals expressed the hope that before an agreement is reached on the regional issue, the four countries with troops stationed on German territory should immediately take measures to reduce these troops, and the scale of the troop reduction should be determined by each country itself.

The press attaches great importance to the fact that the Soviet proposals stipulate that countries, regardless of whether an agreement is reached on the disarmament issue, should reach an agreement on taking partial measures in this regard, which are: immediately stopping thermonuclear weapons tests; prohibiting troops stationed on German territory from being equipped with atomic weapons, and taking relevant measures within three months; and military budgets of all countries should be reduced by 15% compared to the military budgets of 1955.

They also pointed out that the Soviet proposals made a reservation: the issue of the obligations that China should undertake in accordance with the agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces should be studied with the participation of the People's Republic of China.

    苏联政府关于裁军问题的新建议的内容
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社伦敦三十日讯：据本地新闻界人士获得的消息，苏联代表葛罗米柯在三月二十七日的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议上提出了一项苏联政府关于裁军问题的新建议。
    大家知道，在1955年5月10日，苏联政府提出了关于裁军问题的建议，这些建议为解决这个重要问题创造了切实可行的基础。西方国家不接受这些建议，不同意禁止原子武器和从国家军备中取消原子武器。因此，整个裁军问题——禁止原子武器和裁减军备——长久以来一直陷于僵局。
    苏联政府和以前一样，赞成完全和无条件禁止核子武器并且从国家军备中取消它们。但是，为了使整个裁军问题摆脱僵局并且获得建设性的结果起见，苏联政府提出了一项新建议，在这项新建议中没有规定必须先就禁止原子武器达成协议才能裁减武装部队和常规军备。这并不是说苏联政府认为不可能就禁止原子武器和氢武器达成协议。相反的，它打算尽一切努力在最近的将来建设性地解决这个对保障全面和平和安全最为重要的问题。
    据报道，苏联的新方案主张就裁减常规军备和武装部队问题缔结一项国际协定，这个协定将有利于缔结关于禁止原子和热核子武器以及从国家军备中取消这类武器的协定。根据建议，限制和裁减常规军备及武装部队的措施应该在1956—1958年之间完成。
    建议规定，在协定生效以后的最初三个月内，各国应该采取措施不把它们的武装部队和常规军备增加到超过1955年12月31日的时候的水平，并且不把它们对武装部队和军备的拨款增加到超过截至1955年12月31日为止的一年间在这方面的开支的水平。
    据来自同一来源的消息说，苏联的方案规定，在上述三个月的期限届满后，美国、苏联和中国应该着手采取措施把武装部队裁减到一百万—一百五十万人，英国和法国裁减到六十五万人。常规军备和国家对武装部队及常规军备的拨款也应该相应地减少。
    至于其他国家裁减军备和武装部队的程度，将由一次关于普遍裁减军备和武装部队的国际会议来决定。上述国家的武装部队的水平不能超过十五万—二十万人。
    苏联的方案建议，由于采取这些措施的结果而腾出来的基金应该用来提高上述国家人民的福利和给予经济上落后的国家以援助，为了这样的目的，将在联合国的范围内设置一项特别基金。
    据指出，苏联的建议列举了将建立的国际监督机构的权利和权力，建立这个机构是为了有效地监督各国履行裁减常规军备和武装部队的义务，这个机构有足够广泛的权利和权力来实现这样的目的。为了防止一个国家对另一个国家的突袭，国际监督机构将在相互的基础上，在所有有关国家领土内的大港口、铁路交叉点、公路和机场设立监察站。
    根据苏联的新建议，将在其他有关国家的同意下充分地和有效地对这个协定的签字国家在它们国境以外拥有的武装部队和设备实行这种视察制度。
    国际监督机构将在所有协定签字国家内派遣在国际基础上选出来的常驻视察人员，他们在他们行使的监督职权的范围内在任何时候都能自由地接近一切受监督的对象。这种监督的对象将是：军事部队；军事供应品和弹药的仓库；陆海空军的基地；制造常规军备和弹药的工厂。
    此外，苏联建议中还提出，到实行全面裁军计划的某一阶段，在国际间的信任得到加强的条件下，有关国家将研究可能利用空中摄影作为监督的一个方法的问题。
    在建议中还明确规定了监督机构的其他职权。这个机构有权不受阻碍地接触到有关各国用于军事需要的预算拨款的材料，包括各国立法和执行机关对这个问题的一切决定在内。它将在协定参加国的首都设立自己的分支机构，这些分支机构的任务将包括：同这些国家的政府机关保持联系，领导在该国领土上进行活动的监察所和检查人员的工作，以及分析各国提供的情报。
    建议还规定，在裁减常规军备和武装部队的协定遭到破坏的时候，国际监督机构应当就为防止和制止这种破坏行为而要采取的措施向安全理事会提出建议。协定参加国在国际监督机构成立以后的一个月内，应当向这个机构提供一份完全的正式材料，报告自己的武装力量、常规军备和军费的情况。
    值得注意的是，苏联建议中规定在欧洲建立一个包括德国两部分以及同它们相邻的国家的领土在内的军备应该受到限制和调查的地区，作为解决裁军问题的一项重要措施。有关国家应将在一项协定中规定美国、苏联、英国和法国在这一地区的其他国家领土上的驻军的最高限额。这种最高限额的问题应由有关国家讨论。此项协定要禁止在上述地区开进原子部队和运入任何种类的原子武器和氢武器。为了监督履行在这个地区的领土上限制军备的义务的情况，应对协定参加国的武装部队和军备建立共同的检查。
    记者们指出，苏联的建议表示希望：在对地区的问题达成协议以前，在德国领土上驻有军队的四国应当立刻采取措施来裁减这些军队，军队裁减的规模由每一个国家自己决定。
    新闻界人士十分重视这一事实：苏联的建议规定，各国不问对裁军问题是否达成协议，应当就在这方面对采取局部的措施一事达成协议，这些措施是：立刻停止热核子武器试验；禁止驻扎在德国领土上的军队配备原子武器，并且在三个月内采取有关的措施；各国的军事预算应该比1955年的军事预算削减15％。
    他们还指出，苏联建议中作了一个保留：中国根据关于裁减常规军备和武装部队的协定应该承担的义务的问题，应当在中华人民共和国的参加下加以研究。
