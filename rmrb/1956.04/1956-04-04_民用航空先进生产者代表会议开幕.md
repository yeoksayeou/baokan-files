    Civil Aviation Advanced Producers Representative Conference Opens
    The Civil Aviation Advanced Producers Representative Conference opened in Beijing on the 2nd. Attending the conference were 126 advanced producers selected from aviation stations and grassroots units across the country, including outstanding pilots, aviation communicators, and aviation station chiefs.
    The advanced producers attending the conference have mostly made great efforts in "safe navigation" and have made outstanding contributions to the development of civil aviation. Pilot Du Yuanli created a record of six consecutive years of safe flight without accidents; pilot Wu Qingxiang safely flew more than 290,000 kilometers in the past year, overfulfilling the state's transportation tasks; engineer Lin Liren designed a high-level direction finder and blind landing instrument to ensure safe flight. With these two precision instruments, it is possible to accurately determine the direction of the aircraft in the air, and it is also very safe to land at night. There is also engineer Xu Wenliang, thanks to his suggestion, six scrapped airplanes were refitted and put back into production, thus saving the country 2.2 million yuan.
    This conference will summarize and exchange the important advanced experiences of the advanced producer representatives in ensuring safe flight, saving aircraft fuel, improving aircraft repair and maintenance, and maintaining and using communication equipment.

    民用航空先进生产者代表会议开幕
    民用航空先进生产者代表会议二日在北京开幕。出席会议的有从全国各航空站和各基层单位选拔出来的126个先进生产者，包括优秀的飞行员、航空通信员和航空站站长等。
    出席会议的先进生产者，大都曾在“安全航行”方面作过很多努力，对于民航事业的发展有突出的贡献。飞行员杜远礼创造了连续六年安全飞行无事故的纪录；飞行员伍庆香去年一年内安全飞行了二十九万多公里，超额完成了国家规定的运输任务；工程师林立仁设计了保证安全飞行的高平定向仪和盲目降落仪，有了这两种精密仪器，可以保证飞机在空中准确地测定方向，并且在夜间也可以十分安全地降落。还有工程师徐文良，由于他的建议，有六架已经报废的飞机经过改装重新投入生产，因而为国家节省了二百二十万元。
    这次会议将总结和交流先进生产者代表们在保证安全飞行、节省飞机用油、提高飞机修理养护及通信设备维护和使用等各个方面的重要先进经验。
