Correctly Treat Workers' Shortcomings and Mistakes
Zhang Ming, Member of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory (State-owned)

At any time, there will be differences between the more advanced and the more backward among the masses. According to the principles of socialist life, the advanced should help the backward and raise the backward to the level of the advanced. Therefore, correctly treating workers who are lagging behind in production or have shortcomings in their ideology and work style, and enabling these workers to catch up with the ranks of the advanced, is an important method for extensively mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and the potential power of the masses.

Judging from the situation of Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, for a considerable period in the past, a wrong attitude was adopted towards workers who were lagging behind in production or had shortcomings in their ideology and work style. This affected the progress of the workers, the connection between leading cadres and the masses of workers, and also the unity among the workers, which brought damage to production.

One of the most prominent manifestations of the wrong attitude towards these workers is that their backward performance and shortcomings were not specifically analyzed, and they were not given specific help and education, but were casually labeled as "backward elements." This put great pressure on them mentally, or they lost their confidence in catching up with the advanced and resigned themselves to backwardness, or it created confrontation with leading cadres and activists.

For example, Qian Caiying, a weaver in the loom workshop, produced the most substandard cloth because she only cared about output and not quality. She also had a quick temper, often complained, and did not get along well with the workers in her group. As a result, she became a "backward element" that everyone disliked. What about Qian Caiying? As she herself said: "People think I'm bad in every way. When they see my shortcomings, they either criticize or report them, and I'm not convinced. You say yours, I'll do mine." There is no doubt that adopting this attitude towards this worker could not help her progress.

Another example is Wu Zhong'an, a worker in the opening and cleaning workshop, whose family of six relied on his salary to make a living, which was very difficult. He frowned all day long, was not active in production, and did not work hard in learning. However, Party members and cadres did not start by trying to help him solve his living difficulties appropriately to raise his awareness, but simply asked him to "overcome, overcome" this insurmountable difficulty, and also criticized Wu Zhong'an for "emphasizing personal difficulties" and "selfish individualism"; and also called him a "backward element." One can imagine, under these circumstances, how could this worker become active?

There was also Chen Jiatai, an old skilled worker in the loom workshop, who had a long seniority and good skills, but because he could not stand some cadres pointing fingers and criticizing others, he sometimes said to these cadres: "What are you so arrogant about! When I was a mechanic, you didn't even know where you were!" Some people labeled this old skilled worker as a "backward element." In January of this year, this old skilled worker put forward a very good rationalization proposal, but the cadres did not accept it. It is very obvious that adopting this attitude, can the enthusiasm of this old skilled worker be brought into play?

The wrong attitude towards workers who are lagging behind in production or have shortcomings in their ideology and work style is also prominently manifested in the following situation, that is, only listening to the opinions of activists and not listening to the opinions of other workers. It is correct and can be adopted to discuss things with Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists in the group beforehand, and then bring them to the group meeting for discussion; the problem is that they should not turn this discussion into a decision, and at the group meeting, they do not pay attention to listening to the opinions of those workers who did not participate in the prior consultation. Some people complained, saying, "People are activists, we are backward elements, the group leader only has them in his eyes, not us, let the activists go and be busy... we backward elements can rest." It is not difficult to understand that this working method of relying only on activists and losing the general masses, how can it fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all workers?

It should be admitted that this wrong attitude adopted by a few cadres and Party members is welcomed by some activists. Because the general situation of enterprises at present is that output is constantly increasing and quality is also constantly improving. In labor competitions, everyone cherishes the honor of the collective very much. If there are one or two people in the group who are not active in production or whose skills are relatively poor, which affects the completion of the group's plan, it will arouse the indignation of a few advanced workers towards these workers with shortcomings, and individual workers will even discriminate against or even attack these workers with shortcomings. Some people often call workers who produce more defective products "defective cloth king" and "rewind king," which is precisely a reflection of this kind of complaint, discrimination, and so on. Our cadres and Party members do not educate activists to correctly treat the backward performance of workers, but instead support this emotion of activists, and even take the lead in adopting a simple and rude attitude of reprimanding these workers, which further encourages the unhealthy emotions of some activists towards these workers.

In fact, as long as we change our attitude towards these workers with shortcomings, instead of discriminating against them and reprimanding them, but caring for them, respecting them, and helping them, these workers' backward performance in production and shortcomings in their ideology and work style will soon be changed. Take Qian Caiying, a weaver in the loom workshop, for example. After she was assigned to the second production group of Class C, the Party members and activists of the group visited her at home, talked to her, and discussed things with her, and adopted a method of patient persuasion for her shortcomings. For example, when it was discovered that she produced bad cloth due to lack of concentration, when it was discovered that she only cared about her personal output, rushed to start the machine, and did not carefully check the cloth surface, she was sincerely criticized, and she was explained the loss to the country if the quality was reduced, and the consistency of personal interests and national interests. In this way, Qian Caiying's substandard cloth gradually decreased, she no longer complained, and her relationship with everyone became closer. Wu Zhong'an, in the opening and cleaning workshop, the group learned about the true situation of his family's living difficulties, and the trade union decided to give him a long-term subsidy, and bought three pairs of shoes to give to his children. In this way, his mood immediately improved, and production became more active. Chen Jiatai, in the loom workshop, after the cadres realized their mistakes, made self-criticism to him, and adopted and promoted his suggestions, this old skilled worker no longer had any opinions on the cadres, and worked more actively, and played a great role in the trial production of new products.

Facts have proved that the problem does not lie in the fact that some workers have backward performance, but in whether the attitude of the leading cadres towards them is correct. As long as the leading cadres care for them and respect them, as long as the leading cadres educate all cadres, Party members, and activists to help them, then this backward situation can be changed. As for those workers who were not backward in the first place, but whose enthusiasm was affected by some special difficulties, or who only had some shortcomings, it is even easier to become active.

    正确地对待工人的缺点和错误
    中共国营上海第二棉纺织厂委员会委员  张明
    任何时候，群众中都会有比较先进的和比较落后的差别。按照社会主义的生活原则，先进的应该帮助落后的，并且把落后的提高到先进的水平。因此，正确地对待生产上落后或者思想作风上有缺点的工人，使这些工人赶上先进的行列，是广泛发挥群众的积极性和群众的潜在力量的一个重要方法。
    从上海国棉二厂的情况来看，在过去一个相当长的时期内，对生产上落后或者思想作风上有缺点的工人采取了错误的态度。这样，就影响了工人的进步，影响了领导干部和工人群众之间的联系，也影响了工人之间的团结，给生产带来了损害。
    对待这些工人的错误态度最突出的表现之一，就是不对他们的落后表现以及缺点进行具体分析，不对他们进行具体的帮助和教育，就随便给戴上“落后分子”的帽子。这就使他们精神上感到很大压力，或者失掉了赶上先进的信心，自甘落后起来，或者造成同领导干部、同积极分子的对抗。
    比如，布机间挡车工人钱彩英，由于只顾产量，不顾质量，次布出得最多。她脾气又急躁，常常发牢骚，同小组里的工人都处不好。于是，她就成了一个大家都不欢迎的“落后分子”。钱彩英呢？像她自己所说的：“人家看我样样都坏，看见我的缺点不是批评就是汇报，我就不服气，你讲你的，我干我的。”毫无疑问，对待这个工人采取这种态度，怎么能够帮助她进步呢？
    再比如清花间的工人吴钟安，一家六口人的生活靠他一个人的工资维持，生活十分困难。他成天愁眉苦脸，生产不积极，学习也不努力。但是，党员和干部不是从设法帮助他适当解决生活困难问题着手去提高他的觉悟，而是简单地要人家把这种无法克服的困难“克服克服”，还批评吴钟安是“强调个人困难”“自私自利的个人主义”；并且也把他叫作“落后分子”。可以想像，在这种情况下，这个工人怎么能够积极起来呢？
    还有布机间的老技术工人陈嘉太，工龄很长，技术很好，只是由于他看不惯有些干部指手划脚好批评指责别人，有时就冲着这些干部说：“你神气什么！我当机匠的时候，你还不知在那里呢？”就有人给这个老技术工人戴上“落后分子”的帽子。今年一月这个老技术工人提出一项很好的合理化建议，干部就不接受。十分明显，采取这种态度，能够发挥这个老技术工人的积极性吗？
    对待生产上落后或者思想作风上有缺点的工人采取的错误态度还突出地表现在以下这种情况上，就是只听取积极分子的意见，不听取其他工人的意见。有事先同组里的党员团员和积极分子商量，然后拿到小组会上去讨论，这种作法是正确的，是可以采用的；问题只是他们不应该把这种商量变成了决定，到了小组会上，就不注意听取那些没有参加事先商量的工人的意见。有一些人就发牢骚，说“人家是积极分子，咱们是落后分子，小组长眼里只有人家，没有咱们，让人家积极分子去忙吧……咱们这些落后分子落得休息休息”。不难理解，这种只依靠积极分子而丢掉一般群众的工作方法，怎么能够充分发挥全体工人的积极性呢？
    应该承认：少数干部和党员所采取的这种错误态度，是为一部分积极分子所欢迎的。因为目前企业的总的情况是产量在不断增加，质量也在不断提高。劳动竞赛中，每一个人都十分珍视集体的荣誉，小组里如果有一两个生产上不积极或者技术比较差的人，影响了小组计划的完成，就会引起少数先进工人对这些有缺点的工人的愤慨，个别工人还会对这些有缺点的工人歧视以至打击。有人常常把次品出得较多的工人叫做“次布大王”“退卷大王”，正是这种埋怨、歧视等等情绪的反映。我们的干部和党员不去教育积极分子正确地对待工人的落后表现，反而支持积极分子的这种情绪，甚至带头对这些工人采取简单粗暴的斥责态度，这就更加助长了一些积极分子对待这些工人的不健康的情绪。
    实际上，只要我们改变了对这些有缺点的工人的态度，不是去歧视他们、斥责他们，而是关心他们，尊重他们，帮助他们，这些工人生产上的落后表现也好，思想作风上的缺点也好，很快就会有所改变。就拿布机间的钱彩英来说，她被编到丙班第二生产小组以后，小组的党员和积极分子到她家中去访问，同她谈心，有什么事同她商量，对她的缺点采取了耐心说服的办法。比如发现她由于注意力不集中出了坏布的时候，发现她只顾个人产量，抢开车，不认真检查布面的时候，就诚恳地批评她，向她说明降低了质量对国家的损失，说明个人利益和国家利益的一致性。这样，钱彩英的次布逐渐减少了，也不再发牢骚了，同大家的关系也亲密起来了。清花间的吴钟安，小组了解了他家中生活困难的真实情况，工会决定给他长期补助，并且买了三双鞋子送给他的孩子。这样他的情绪马上好转，生产也就积极起来。布机间的陈嘉太，在干部认识了自己的错误，向他作了自我批评，又采纳和推广了他的建议以后，这个老技术工人对干部也没意见了，工作更加积极，在试制新产品中起了很大作用。
    事实证明，问题不在于有些工人有落后的表现，而在于领导干部对他们的态度是否正确。只要领导干部对他们关怀、尊重，只要领导干部教育所有干部、党员和积极分子去帮助他们，那末这种落后的状况是可以改变的。至于那些本来并不落后，只是由于某种特殊困难影响着他们的积极性的工人，或者只是有某些缺点的工人，就更容易积极起来了。
