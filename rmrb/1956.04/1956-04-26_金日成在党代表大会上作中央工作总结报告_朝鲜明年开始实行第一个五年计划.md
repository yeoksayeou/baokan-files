Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 25th. Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, proposed North Korea's first Five-Year Plan, starting next year, in his summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party at the Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party on April 23rd. Kim Il-sung said that during this Five-Year Plan, socialist elements should be further expanded and developed in all sectors of the people's economy, the construction of the industrialization base should be promoted more vigorously, and light industry and agricultural production should be raised to new levels. During the Five-Year Plan, agriculture and light industry will be developed more rapidly under the principle of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and the material welfare of the people will be sought on this basis.

In the industrial field, more modern industries should be newly built and existing factories should be rebuilt. The colonial deformity in North Korea's industry should be fundamentally eliminated, and the realization of North Korea's socialist industrialization should be promoted. The report talked about the main tasks of each industrial sector in the Five-Year Plan. By 1961, pig iron production should increase to 2.8 times that of 1956, steel should increase to 3 to 3.5 times, coal should increase to 1.7 times, and power generation should increase to 8.5 billion kilowatt-hours.

In the agricultural field, agricultural production, especially grain production, should be greatly increased; the agricultural collectivization movement should be further developed and consolidated organizationally and economically, and the collectivization of the entire agriculture should be completed. Grain production must be increased to a level that is basically self-sufficient within five years.

The report detailed the achievements made in the three-year plan, which began in 1954. The report said that the state-owned and cooperative industrial sectors had already exceeded the 1956 production level stipulated in the three-year plan by the end of January this year. By the end of 1955, 236 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises had been fully or partially restored, and another 71 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises had been newly built. At the same time, in 1955, the proportion of industrial production by state-owned and cooperative enterprises in the total industrial output value had increased to 98.3%, and private industry will soon be completely transformed into socialist economic components.

In the agricultural field, the agricultural collectivization movement is rapidly rising. By the end of February this year, 14,651 agricultural production cooperatives had been established, and the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 65.6% of the total number of peasant households, and the cultivated land area accounted for 62.1% of the total area.

The report talked about suggestions on the peaceful reunification of North Korea: In order to realize the peaceful reunification of North Korea, establish a united front with the participation of all patriotic political parties, social organizations, and patriotic people in North and South Korea; convene a joint conference of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea.

The report also suggested the establishment of a standing committee that has the right to discuss a series of issues from promoting contact between the North and South to unifying the North and South, and can take practical measures; representatives from the governments, supreme legislative bodies, political parties, and social organizations of North and South Korea, as well as non-party members, should participate in this institution in equal proportions. The report said that in order to realize the above-mentioned proposals and propositions, the achievements of the armistice must first be consolidated and transformed into a solid peace. The report emphasized that countries concerned with the peaceful resolution of the North Korean issue should convene an international conference with the participation of representatives of the governments of North and South Korea to create practical conditions for peacefully resolving the North Korean issue.

The summary report includes three parts: the international and domestic situation and party building. When talking about party building, the report announced that as of January 1 this year, the Labor Party had more than 1,164,900 members and more than 58,000 branches, an increase of more than 439,000 members and more than 28,400 branches compared with the Second Congress.

    金日成在党代表大会上作中央工作总结报告
    朝鲜明年开始实行第一个五年计划
    新华社平壤25日电  朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成在朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会四月二十三日的会上作朝鲜劳动党中央委员会工作总结报告时，提出了从明年开始的朝鲜第一个五年计划。金日成说，在这个五年计划的期间，在人民经济各部门中，应进一步扩大和发展社会主义成分，更加有力地推进工业化基础的建设，把轻工业和农业生产提高到新的水平。在五年计划期间，将在优先发展重工业的方针下，更加迅速地发展农业和轻工业，并且在这基础上谋求人民的物质福利。
    在工业方面，要新建更多的现代化工业，重建原有的工厂，要在根本上消除朝鲜工业中的殖民地畸形状态，促进朝鲜社会主义工业化的实现。报告谈到了五年计划中各工业部门的主要任务。到1961年，生铁产量要增加到1956年的二点八倍，钢增加到三倍到三点五倍，煤增加到一点七倍，发电量增加到八十五亿瓩时。
    在农业方面，要大大提高农业生产，特别是粮食生产；要进一步发展农业合作化运动，并且从组织上和经济上加以巩固，完成整个农业的合作化。在五年内必须把粮食产量提高到基本上能够自给自足的水平。
    报告详细谈到了正在实行的从1954年开始的三年计划所取得的成就。报告说，国营和合作社营的工业部门，已经在今年一月底超额完成了三年计划所规定的1956年生产水平。在1955年底已有二百三十六个大、中型国营企业全部或部分恢复起来，另外还新建了七十一个大、中型国营企业。同时，在1955年度，在工业总产值中，国营和合作社营的工业生产的比重已经增加到98.3％，私营工业不久即将全部改造成为社会主义经济成分。
    在农业方面，农业合作化运动正在迅速高涨，到今年二月底，已经成立了14，651个农业生产合作社，参加农业生产合作社的农户占农户总数的65.6％，耕地面积占总面积的62.1％。
    报告在谈到朝鲜的和平统一问题的建议：为了实现朝鲜的和平统一，建立一个有南北朝鲜全体爱国政党、社会团体和爱国人士参加的统一战线；召开南北朝鲜政党、社会团体的联席会议。
    报告还建议成立一个有权讨论从促进南北之间接触问题到统一南北问题等一系列问题、并且能采取实际措施的常设委员会；由南北朝鲜的政府、最高立法机关、政党、社会团体的代表和无党派人士以同等的比例参加这个机构。报告说，为了实现上述的提案和主张，首先就要巩固停战的成就，使之转变成为巩固的和平。报告强调说，关心朝鲜问题和平解决的国家应该召开有南北朝鲜政府代表参加的国际会议，创造能够和平解决朝鲜问题的实际条件。
    总结报告包括国际、国内形势和党的建设三个部分。报告在谈到党的建设时宣布，到今年一月一日为止，劳动党拥有党员一百一十六万四千九百多名，五万八千多个支部，比第二次代表大会时增加党员四十三万九千多名和二万八千四百多个支部。
