Why is the Utilization Rate of Farmer Labor Low in the Zhangye Area?

An Zhen, Secretary of the CPC Zhangye Prefectural Committee, Gansu Province

According to a recent inspection by the CPC Zhangye Prefectural Committee, the spring production work in the entire area has been progressing slowly, except for the relatively well-done work of accumulating fertilizer and spring irrigation. As of March 10th, only a small number of townships in Yumen, Anxi, Zhangye, Dunhuang, Yongchang, and Minqin counties had expanded their irrigated land by more than 130,000 mu. The majority of townships in these counties and other counties only began to carry out work such as land reclamation, water conservancy construction, building field ridges, and planting trees and afforestation around March 10th.

Why is the spring production work in the Zhangye area progressing so slowly? This is closely related to the low utilization rate of labor in agricultural production cooperatives. In many agricultural production cooperatives, not all male and female farmers are working, but only a portion of them. For example, in the Fifth Agricultural Production Cooperative of Ganzun Township, Zhangye County, from the establishment of the cooperative in late December of last year to March 10th, the male and female members who regularly participated in labor only accounted for 35.5% of the total labor force. In the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative of Liangjiadun Township, Zhangye County, an average of 469 people were dispatched to work each day in the three days before spring plowing and sowing, accounting for only 61% of the total male and female labor force of the cooperative.

Is it that members of agricultural cooperatives are unwilling to work, that the labor utilization rate is so low during the tense period of preparing for farming? No. The members all know the principle of "more work, more gain" and actively request to participate in labor. However, many leading cadres of the cooperatives have neglected this legitimate demand of the members and adopted the wrong methods of shift work and lowering work points to limit the participation of members in labor. Some members are worried about their future income and family life because they do not have the opportunity to participate in more labor. Some questioned the core members of the cooperative: "The National Agricultural Development Program requires us to work more and increase production. If you don't let us participate in labor, how can we increase production?" Some members have no choice but to make other plans and engage in sideline production themselves because they cannot participate in much labor.

Why restrict members from working? It is said to be because "there is no work to do." But in fact, there is a lot of work that can be done. Work such as water conservancy construction and land reclamation could have been carried out simultaneously in separate groups, but many cooperatives are moving slowly, doing one thing and then doing another.

The resident staff knows that the labor force of many cooperatives is not being fully utilized, but they ignore it. The reason why certain core members of cooperatives do not actively develop labor potential is that they are afraid that if members participate in more labor, the remuneration for each work day stipulated in the financial plan will be reduced.

On the one hand, the labor force cannot be fully utilized, and on the other hand, many core members of cooperatives say: "This year's production tasks are heavy, the production increase targets are high, and there is a real shortage of labor." If you calculate carefully, you will find that this statement is unfounded. The Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative of Liangjiadun Township, Zhangye County, has 361 full male laborers, 56 semi-male laborers, and 351 full female laborers. The entire cooperative has 2,093 mu of land. If the scale of production is not expanded and the content of production is not enriched, it is estimated that 215 full laborers (semi-male laborers and full female laborers are also converted into full male laborers) will be wasted throughout the year. Let's analyze the labor needs of this cooperative during the spring plowing and sowing season: the entire cooperative has a total of 768 male and female laborers, and 1,552 mu of wheat are sown. Each mu requires three workdays, and it is planned to complete the sowing in ten days, which only requires 465 people. It can be seen that even during the sowing period, this cooperative can also transfer a portion of the labor force to carry out work such as land reclamation and water conservancy construction at the same time. Of course, Liangjiadun Township is a place with a large population and little land, and other places may not have so much surplus labor; however, it can be said with certainty that if agricultural cooperatives in the Zhangye area only operate on the existing land, the labor force will not be fully utilized anywhere.

Since this is the case, why don't rural workers help the cooperatives find production avenues and carry out water conservancy construction and land reclamation activities? This requires finding the reasons in their thinking. In the Zhangye area, you can hear these words everywhere: "Since the liberation of Hexi, which year hasn't been a bumper harvest?" Indeed, the Hexi Corridor has had bumper harvests year after year for several years. However, they have forgotten that the so-called bumper harvest in the past was measured by the production standards of the small-scale peasant economy, and this standard is very low. Moreover, the bumper harvests in the Hexi Corridor in the past few years cannot be entirely attributed to our work; good years and superior natural conditions are an important factor in bumper harvests. When you ask rural workers about this year's production situation, you often hear this answer: "This year's production will definitely be better than last year." It is this complacency that makes some rural comrades stop making progress in the face of existing work achievements.

Due to the interference of complacency, many rural workers turn a blind eye to the chaotic situation in the management and operation of cooperatives. In some cooperatives, the phenomenon of livestock being thin and dying has occurred. In some cooperatives, as of March 10th, there were only production plans and financial plans, but no labor allocation plans. In some cooperatives, a chaotic phenomenon of so-called "walking in a long line, doing work in a swarm" has occurred in production.

On March 10th, the CPC Zhangye Prefectural Committee convened a meeting of county party secretaries in the Zhangye area. The meeting required rural workers in the entire area to launch criticism and self-criticism, and to fight against the above-mentioned complacency and conservative ideas; the meeting required leaders at the prefectural, county, and township levels to improve their working methods, go deep into reality, investigate and research, help cooperatives find production avenues, formulate labor allocation plans, and quickly carry out various production activities.

    张掖区农民劳动力利用率为什么低
    中共甘肃省张掖地委书记　安振
    据中共张掖地委不久以前的检查，全区的春季生产工作除积肥、春灌等工作做得较好外，农田水利、开荒、植树造林等工作都开展得很慢。截至三月十日，全区只有玉门、安西、张掖、敦煌、永昌、民勤等县的一小部分乡扩大了水浇地十三万多亩，这些县的大部分乡和其他县，在三月十日左右才陆续开始开荒、兴修水利、打地埂、植树造林等工作。
    张掖地区的春季生产工作为什么开展得这样慢呢？这同农业生产合作社劳动力的利用率不高有密切关系。在许多农业生产合作社里，不是全体男女农民都在劳动，而是只有一部分人在劳动。例如张掖县甘俊乡第五农业生产合作社，从去年十二月下旬建社到三月十日，经常参加劳动的男女社员，只占全部劳动力的35.5％。张掖县梁家墩乡先锋农业生产合作社在春耕播种前的三天内，平均每天派工469人，仅占全社男女劳动力总数的61％。
    在紧张的备耕时期，劳动利用率却这样低，是农业合作社社员不愿意劳动吗？不是的。社员们都知道“多劳多得”的道理，都积极要求参加劳动。但是，不少合作社的领导骨干都忽视社员的这种正当要求，采取了轮班干活和降低工分的错误办法，来限制社员参加劳动。有些社员因为得不到多参加劳动的机会，而忧虑将来的收入和家庭生活。有的质问社里的骨干：“全国农业发展纲要要我们多劳动，多增加生产，你们不让我们参加劳动，怎么能增加生产呢？”有些社员因为参加不上多少劳动，只好另作打算，自己去从事副业生产。
    为什么要限制社员劳动？据说是因为“没有活干”。可是事实上可干的活多得很。像兴修水利、开荒等工作，本来可以同时分头进行，但是许多合作社在慢腾腾地迈步，做了一件再做另一件。
    许多合作社劳动力没有充分利用的情况，驻社工作人员是知道的，但是他们不理睬。而某些合作社的骨干所以不去积极发挥劳动潜力，是因为害怕社员参加劳动多了，会使财务计划上规定的每个劳动日的报酬减少。
    一方面劳动力不能充分利用，另方面许多合作社的骨干又说：“今年生产任务大，增产指标高，劳动力实在缺很多。”如果认真计算一下，就会发现这种说法是没有根据的。张掖县梁家墩乡先锋农业生产合作社有男全劳动力361个、男半劳动力56个、女全劳动力351个。全社共有2，093亩土地，如果不扩大生产规模和充实生产内容，估计全年将有215个全劳动力（男半劳动力和女全劳动力也折成男全劳动力计算），被白白浪费掉。再分析一下这个合作社春耕播种时期需要劳动力的情况：全社男女劳动力共768人，播种小麦1，552亩，每亩需要三个工，计划在十天内完成播种，只需要465人就够了。可见就是在播种期间，这个合作社也可以抽调一部分劳动力同时进行开荒、兴修水利等工作。当然，梁家墩乡是个人多地少的地方，别的地方可能不会剩余这么多的劳动力；但是，可以肯定的说，张掖地区的农业合作社如果只经营现有的土地，无论在那里，劳动力都是用不了的。
    既然这样，农村工作人员为什么不去帮助合作社找生产门路、进行水利建设和开荒等活动呢？这就要从他们的思想中去找原因了。在张掖地区，到处可以听到这样的话：“我们河西解放以来，那年不是丰收？”不错，河西走廊几年来的确是年年丰收。但是，他们忘记了，过去所说的丰收是用小农经济的生产标准来衡量的，这个标准是很低的。而且，过去几年河西走廊的丰收，并不能全部归功于我们的工作；年成好，自然条件优越就是丰收的一个重要因素。当你向农村工作人员问起今年的生产情况的时候，也常常听到这样的回答：“今年生产准比去年好。”正是这种自满情绪使某些农村工作同志在已有的工作成绩面前停步不前。
    由于自满情绪在作祟，许多农村工作人员对于合作社里经营管理方面的混乱情况熟视无睹。有些合作社中发生了牲口瘦弱、死亡的现象。有些合作社直到三月十日，还都只有生产计划和财务计划，而没有劳动力调配计划。有些合作社在生产中发生了所谓“走起路来一长串，做起活来一窝蜂”的混乱现象。
    中共张掖地委在三月十日召开了张掖地区县委书记会议，会议要求全区农村工作人员展开批评和自我批评，向上述骄傲自满情绪和保守思想进行斗争；要求专区、县、乡的领导人员改进工作方法，深入实际，调查研究，帮助合作社找生产门路，制定劳动力调配计划，迅速把各项生产开展起来。
