    Newly Built Lock on Dongting Lake
    The newly built Huang Maozhou Lock on Dongting Lake was completed on March 20th. This lock is built at the starting point of the Saiyang Canal in Yuanjiang County, connecting the Chilei Floodway and Datong Lake. In the past, there was no good port for ships to enter or exit along the more than 400-li-long ring dike line of the Datong Lake area. Water transportation was very inconvenient, and agricultural products and industrial raw materials could not be transported in or out, requiring more than one million manual porter trips every year. The completion of the Huang Maozhou Lock allows passenger ships with a load of 120 tons to freely travel to and fro, and can also save a lot of transportation costs. (Ding Yanshan)

    洞庭湖上新建的船闸
    洞庭湖上新建的黄茅洲船闸已经在三月二十日竣工。这座船闸建立在沅江县塞阳运河的起点，沟通赤磊洪道和大通湖。过去在大通湖区四百多里长的环湖堤线上，没有一个较好的船只进出口，水上运输很不方便，农产品和工业原料不能出进，每年需要有一百多万人工挑运。黄茅洲船闸的建成可以使载重一百二十吨的客轮从这里自由来往，并且能够节约许多运费。　（丁炎山）
