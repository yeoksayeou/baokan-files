To the Editor:

    Wulong Mountain is a large mountain in Jiande County, Zhejiang Province. It is more than eighty *li* in circumference, with a mountainous area of more than 70,000 *mu*. The soil is fertile and suitable for the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. In the past, except for the state-owned forest farm which operated on more than 16,000 *mu* of mountain land, the rest of the mountain land was barren or semi-barren and had not been utilized.

    After the autumn harvest last year, 80% of the farmers in the Wulong Mountain area joined cooperatives, and they urgently requested the development of the mountainous area; at the same time, the people in the towns also had the same request. Therefore, after clarifying the situation, the Jiande County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a plan for the development of Wulong Mountain, requiring the greening of the entire mountain within two years. Subsequently, specialized organizations were established from the county to the village to lead this work, and the benefits of developing the mountainous area and related policies were widely and deeply publicized.

    After publicity and mobilization, the masses' enthusiasm for developing the mountainous area soared to an unprecedented level, and more than 10,000 people enthusiastically participated in the work of greening Wulong Mountain. Liao Zhongkui, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Chengtou Township, originally planned to get married on December 30, 1955. In order to participate in the work of greening the barren hills, he discussed with his fiancée and postponed the wedding. The youth shock brigade in Ankou Township enthusiastically launched a competition, and they composed a *kuaiban* saying: "Today we reclaim for tomorrow, tomorrow's happiness depends on today; let's work harder and not come down the mountain without winning the red flag." Cadres, workers, students, and residents in the urban area also actively participated in the work of greening Wulong Mountain. The comrades of the police team sent soil fertilizer up the mountain, carrying more than 200 *jin* each time. The women in the town with good physical strength formed a large team to work on the mountain, and the rest participated in the nursery team, the watering team, and the straw sandal making team. The straw sandal making team made more than 1,000 pairs of straw sandals. The elementary school students of Meicheng Town No. 2 also collected more than 300 *jin* of tree seeds to support the development of the mountainous area. From late November last year to January this year, these more than 10,000 people planted a total of 7,700 *mu* of oil tea, 600 *mu* of pine, 300 *mu* of *malan*, 20 *mu* of chestnuts, and 20 *mu* of tea, and the quality met the requirements.

    The upsurge in the development of Wulong Mountain influenced the farmers in other villages in the county to actively develop the mountainous areas. More than 20 townships and more than 20,000 people in the county have greened more than 40,000 *mu* of barren hills. The farmers in Qianyuan Township planted trees on more than 2,000 *mu* of barren hills in Zhangyan Mountain in five days.

    建德县人民开发山区的热潮编辑同志：
    乌龙山是我们浙江建德县的一座较大的山。这座山周围八十多里，山地面积七万多亩，土质肥沃，适宜于农、林、牧业的发展。过去，除了国营林场在山上经营了一万六千多亩山地以外，其余的山地都是荒芜或半荒芜的，没有被利用起来。
    去年秋收以后，乌龙山区的农民有80％入了社，他们迫切要求开发山区；同时城镇人民也有着同样的要求。因此，中共建德县委在摸清情况以后，作出了开发乌龙山的规划，要求在两年中绿化全山。接着，全县由县到村都成立了专门机构来领导这个工作，并且广泛而深入地宣传了开发山区的好处和有关政策。
    经过宣传动员以后，群众开发山区的积极性空前高涨，有一万多人兴高采烈地参加了绿化乌龙山的工作。程头乡的青年团支部书记廖仲奎原来定在1955年12月30日结婚。为了参加绿化荒山的工作，他就同未婚妻商量好延期结婚。庵口乡青年突击队热烈地展开了竞赛，他们编了个快板说：“今天开荒为明天，明天幸福靠今天；大家努力加把劲，不夺红旗不下山。”城区的干部、工人、学生和居民也踊跃参加了绿化乌龙山的工作。民警队的同志把土肥送上山去，每人每次就挑二百多斤。城镇妇女体力好的成立了一个大队，上山干活，其余的分别参加了托儿队、浇水队和打草鞋队，打草鞋队一共打了一千多双草鞋。梅城镇第二小学的小学生，也采集了三百多斤树种，来支援开发山区的工作。这一万多人从去年十一月下旬到今年一月，共种了油茶七千七百亩、松木六百亩、麻栎三百亩、板栗二十亩、茶叶二十亩，质量都符合要求。
    开发乌龙山的热潮，影响了县里其他乡村的农民也积极进行开发山区的工作。全县二十多个乡、二万多人一共绿化了荒山四万多亩。前源乡全乡农民用五天时间，就在樟岩山二千多亩荒山上都种上了树。
