A pair of modern shafts recently began construction in a new coal mining area near Baotou. The production processes of sinking, transporting, and hoisting these shafts will all be mechanized, utilizing coal cutters, conveyors, underground electric locomotives, and electric winches.

The shaft construction team responsible for building the shafts has decided to use permanent hoisting equipment to excavate the shafts and will utilize the tunneling roadways of the Dafa Coal Mine near the mining area to open up working faces. This will shorten the time to put them into production to twenty months and save a large amount of investment.

The coal produced here will supply the production needs of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex. (Xinhua News Agency)

    包头附近兴建一对竖井
    一对现代化的竖井，最近在包头附近的一个新煤矿区动工兴建。这对竖井的掘进、运输和提升等生产过程，将全部利用割煤机、运输机、井下电车和电动绞车等机械进行生产。
    负责兴建竖井的建井队，决定用永久性的提升设备开凿井筒，并且将利用矿区附近大发煤矿的掘进巷道开辟工作面，这样，投入生产的时间可缩短到二十个月，并可节省很大一笔投资。
    从这里生产的煤炭，将供应包头钢铁联合企业生产的需要。（新华社）
