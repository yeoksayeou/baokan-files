Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the World Federation of Scientific Workers
Peng Zhen, Mayor of Beijing, Sends Congratulatory Message

Ladies, gentlemen, friends, and comrades:

Today, the World Federation of Scientific Workers is holding its tenth anniversary celebration in Beijing. Please allow me, on behalf of the people of Beijing, to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the conference, and to express a warm welcome to the distinguished scientists from various countries who have traveled far to Beijing.

Ten years ago, the world's eminent scientists put forward the call for science to serve peace and the happiness of mankind, opposing the use of science as a tool for mass slaughter, and organized the World Federation of Scientific Workers. Over the past ten years, the Federation has unremittingly strived for this noble goal and has achieved great success, which is a great contribution to the whole world and all mankind. Here, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to the World Federation of Scientific Workers and the scientists who have made such outstanding contributions.

We Chinese people love peace. In particular, having suffered from the disasters of war for nearly a century, we cherish peace and love peace, cherish and respect friends in the scientific community who serve peace, just as a person who has just recovered from a long illness cherishes health.

Our China is still a scientifically backward country. We need science, cherish science, love science, and love and respect friends in the scientific community who serve the happiness of mankind, just as a hungry person needs bread. Now, friends from the World Federation of Scientific Workers have come to our country to visit, bringing with them the friendship of scientists and people from various countries, and bringing with them the world's advanced scientific achievements. This is the most precious gift to our people. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks here.

I sincerely welcome friends from the scientific community of various countries who have come to our country for a visit to tour Beijing and other places, to understand our situation in various aspects, to see our good and progressive aspects, and also to see our shortcomings and backward aspects. There are still many shortcomings and errors in our work, and I hope you will give us your corrections.

Finally, I wish the World Federation of Scientific Workers greater success in uniting scientists from all over the world and making more splendid and greater contributions to world peace and the happiness of mankind.

    庆祝世界科协成立十周年
    北京市市长彭真的贺词女士们，先生们，朋友们，同志们：
    今天世界科学工作者协会在北京举行十周年纪念大会，请允许我代表北京市人民向大会致衷心的祝贺，并且对远道来北京的各国卓越的科学家们表示热烈的欢迎。
    十年前，世界卓越的科学家们提出了科学为和平、为人类幸福服务的号召，反对利用科学作大规模屠杀的工具，组织了世界科学工作者协会。十年来，协会坚持不懈地为这个崇高的目标努力奋斗，已经获得了巨大的成就，这是对全世界全人类的伟大贡献。我在这里谨向作出了这样卓越贡献的世界科学工作者协会和科学家们表示热烈的祝贺。
    我们中国人民是热爱和平的，特别是由于近百年来我们曾经饱受过战争的灾难，这就更使得我们像一个久病初愈的人珍视健康一样，珍视和平、热爱和平，热爱和尊敬为和平服务的科学界的朋友们。
    我们中国还是一个科学很落后的国家，我们就好像一个饥饿的人需要面包一样，需要科学、珍视科学、热爱科学、热爱和尊敬为人类幸福服务的科学界的朋友们。现在世界科学工作者协会的朋友们，来到我国访问，带来了各国科学家和各国人民的友谊，带来了世界先进的科学成就，这是对我国人民最珍贵的礼物。我在这里特表示衷心的感谢。
    我恳切的欢迎来到我国访问的各国科学界的朋友们在北京和各地参观，了解我们各方面的情况，看一看我们好的和进步的方面，也看一看我们的缺点和落后的方面，我们工作中的缺点和错误还是很多的，希望各位给予指正。
    最后，我预祝世界科学工作者协会更进一步地团结全世界的科学家，为世界和平、为人类幸福作出更辉煌、更伟大的贡献。
