    Traditional Chinese Medicine Has a High Cure Rate for Mental Illness
    Hebei Province has achieved significant results in organizing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment for mental illness. In February and March of this year, the Provincial Health Department and the Provincial Association of Health Workers organized 41 experienced TCM practitioners specializing in mental illness treatment to conduct practical clinical treatment in Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and other places. Over 50 days, they treated a total of 323 patients. Excluding 61 patients who discontinued treatment, 167 were cured, representing a cure rate of 63.74%; 79 patients experienced significant symptom reduction, and only 16 remained uncured. During the treatment process, the acupuncture "shock" therapy of TCM practitioners Hu Dongshu and Deng Wenyu from Anguo County had astonishing effects. No matter how severe a patient's mania, a single needle could induce "shock," allowing for calm medical treatment. Among the cured cases were many patients with long-term illnesses. For example, worker Xiong Enqing fell ill in 1954 and was treated at the Beijing Mental Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital for more than three months without improvement. However, this time he was quickly cured.
    In order to promote the valuable experience of the motherland's medical heritage, the Hebei Provincial Health Department has not only absorbed five TCM practitioners specializing in mental illness treatment into state medical institutions to continue systematic treatment and research but has also awarded a bonus of 3,000 yuan to the TCM practitioners who participated in this treatment work.

    中医治疗精神病治愈率很高
    河北省组织中医治疗精神病获得了显著成绩。在今年的二月和三月间，省卫生厅和省卫生工作者协会曾组织四十一名富有精神病治疗经验的中医，到秦皇岛、唐山等地进行实际临床治疗工作。在五十多天中，共治疗323人，其中除中断治疗的六十一人外，共治愈167人，治愈率占63.74％；症状显著减轻的有七十九人，未愈的只有十六人。在治疗过程中，安国县胡东署、邓文郁两位中医的针灸“休克”疗法有惊人的效果，不论病人癫狂得多么严重，只要一针下去就可以使病人“休克”，然后再从容医治。在治愈的病例中，也有不少长期不愈的患者，例如工人熊恩庆，于1954年患病，曾在北京精神病防治院治疗三个多月未愈，但这次很快就被治好了。
    为了发扬祖国医学遗产中的宝贵经验，河北省卫生厅除已吸收五名治疗精神病的中医参加了国家医疗机构，继续作系统的治疗研究工作外，并对参加这次治疗工作的中医，授予了三千元的奖金。（王力夫）
