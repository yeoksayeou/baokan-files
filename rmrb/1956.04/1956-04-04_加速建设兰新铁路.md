    Accelerate the Construction of the Lanxin Railway
    Chen Yi, Director of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways
    This year, the state requires us to lay 496 kilometers of track on the Lanxin line, including 407 kilometers of main line. According to this plan, the Lanxin Railway will reach Daquan, west of Heishan Gorge, by the end of this year, and will enter the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region next spring.
    This year's track-laying mileage on the Lanxin Railway is more than double the actual track-laying mileage last year. The construction area this year is also very remote. West of Qingshui, most of the area along the line consists of sand dunes, lake beaches, and dangerous rapids, and it has to pass through a long section of honeycomb-shaped gypsum area. This is a completely new problem in terms of construction technology. The further west the line goes, the more difficult the water source becomes. Both domestic water and construction water have to be transported by trucks from dozens of kilometers away. West of Yumen, there are frequent 11-level gales. These all bring great difficulties to the construction.
    In order to successfully complete this year's construction task of the Lanxin Railway, our engineering bureau first examined and criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking in our previous work. This kind of thinking is specifically manifested in being satisfied with the current construction speed, failing to see the high enthusiasm of the masses for socialist construction, and always emphasizing the untimely supply of design documents when arranging the entire work, instead of actively trying to overcome difficulties. In the past few years, the amount of work completed in the first quarter was less than 10%, less than 20% in the second quarter, 20% to 30% in the third quarter, and more than 40% in the fourth quarter. If this situation can be changed, we will certainly be able to build more railways for the country. We have also adopted a lukewarm attitude towards the promotion of advanced experiences and the rationalization proposals of employees. The single-person drilling method in stone engineering can improve work efficiency by 60% to 70% compared with the double-person drilling method, but it has not been widely promoted for more than two years, resulting in many people failing to reach the quota for a long time. The stone-laying slurry extrusion method created by worker Zhang Hanchen can save 50% of cement. Other engineering bureaus have promoted this experience and achieved great results. We not only did not promote it, but also disbanded Zhang Hanchen's work team. Small-scale mechanized construction was also advocated by our engineering bureau and once played a significant role. Other engineering bureaus have promoted this experience, but we have gradually reduced the scope of its use. In theory, with the improvement of workers' political awareness, the increase in the proportion of machinery use, and rationalization proposals should be more and more, but we are getting less and less. Workers criticized our attitude towards rationalization proposals: "Said on the mouth, written on paper, handed to the cadres with no end." Conservative thinking is also reflected in the use of machinery. Last year, the higher authorities wanted to allocate a batch of construction machinery to us, but we refused because we were afraid of being burdened, and also sealed up many original usable machines. We used to think that the cost of mechanical construction was high, but this is not the case. Recently, the mechanical engineering team led by Comrade Meng Qingyuan spent more than 220,000 yuan less on station construction than manual construction.
    After examining and criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, we changed our working methods according to the principles of overall planning and strengthened leadership. First, we held a balance meeting with the design institute and the infrastructure sub-bureau to solve the problem of cooperation between the design and construction departments. In the past, the supply of most design documents was often concentrated in the third and fourth quarters. This made it difficult for us to arrange production evenly, and we could not correctly prepare for some projects that were about to start construction. Sometimes the documents submitted by the design unit were inconsistent with our original construction organization design. At this meeting, the design department first introduced the annual workload, project progress, construction methods, and document supply time, so that everyone had a general understanding of this year's project, and then discussed the first quarter's project in detail. We put forward our opinions based on the requirements of construction, and the design department considered and appropriately adjusted the document supply time, so that the construction design was consistent. The amount of work in the first quarter of this year reached 15%, and we can start preparing for the second quarter, shortening the construction preparation time for the second quarter. The arrangement of the number of projects in the other three quarters is also roughly close to balance.
    Secondly, we strengthened the compilation of construction organization design. In the past, this work was done by the construction organization design section, which only had simple construction progress, construction methods, and rough labor requirements. Such a construction organization design could not effectively guide production, and could not organize the forces of various departments to serve the project. Therefore, sometimes the transportation department did not transport the materials to the construction site in time, the finished product factory did not supply the finished products in time, and the machinery and equipment were not allocated in time. This year, we first sent a working group to the line to understand the characteristics and conditions of the construction area, and then, according to the results of the balance meeting, convened the heads of planning, technology, construction, materials, machinery, transportation, and affiliated enterprises, and the main engineers, to discuss in detail this year's project tasks, and make specific requirements for the progress of the project (especially key projects), and then study the problems that should be solved in the process of completing the plan. This made each department clear about their responsibilities, had a bottom line in their hearts, and could foreseeably solve problems. For example, the supply of bridge finished products, we used to think that the problem was not big, but this time we found that there were many shortages. The processing plant has now begun to expand its equipment to solve this contradiction.
    Third, do a good job in promoting advanced experience and rationalization proposals, and better organize the enthusiasm of the masses for labor. We decided to establish an advanced experience promotion section in the engineering bureau, and establish production committees and rationalization proposal committees in each team to strengthen the specific leadership of the labor competition, and organize technical personnel to help workers solve problems in technical improvement. Advanced experience training classes will also be established on the construction site to organize demonstrations, performances, and experience exchange meetings to disseminate advanced working methods.
    After these efforts, with the unprecedented enthusiasm of employees for building a socialist society, coupled with the close cooperation of relevant parties, we will surely successfully complete this year's construction tasks.

### 加速建设兰新铁路

    加速建设兰新铁路
    铁道部第三工程局局长　陈遗
    国家今年要求我们在兰新线上铺轨496公里，其中正线407公里。按照这个计划，兰新铁路将于年底通到黑山峡以西的大泉，明年春天便可进入新疆维吾尔自治区了。
    兰新路今年的铺轨里程比去年实际铺轨里程增加一倍多。今年施工的地区又很偏僻，从清水往西，沿线除少数农田外，大部分是沙丘、湖滩、险滩，还要穿过很长一段蜂窝状的石膏地带，这在施工技术上完全是一个新的问题。线路愈往西，水源越困难。生活用水、工程用水都得用汽车从几十公里以外的地方运。玉门以西不时有十一级大风。这些都给施工带来很大困难。
    为了胜利完成今年兰新铁路的建设任务，我们工程局首先检查和批判了以前工作中的右倾保守思想。这种思想具体表现在满足于现在的建设速度，看不到群众高涨的社会主义建设的积极性，在安排整个工作的时候，总是强调设计文件供应不及时，而不主动想办法克服困难。几年来，第一季度完成的工程量不到10％，第二季度不到20％，第三季度为20％到30％，40％以上在第四季度完成。假使能改变这一情况，一定可以为国家修建更多的铁路。我们对于推广先进经验和职工的合理化建议，也采取了冷淡的态度。石方工程中的单人打钎法，比双人打钎法工作效率可以提高60％到70％，但是两年多来，一直没有广泛推行，结果很多人长期达不到定额。工人张汉臣所创造的砌石挤浆流水作业法，可以节约水泥50％，别的工程局推广了这个经验，收效很大，我们不仅没有推广，反而把张汉臣的工作班拆散了。小型机械化施工也是我们工程局倡议的，曾经起了很大作用，其它工程局都推广了这个经验，而我们却逐渐缩小使用范围。按道理说，随着工人政治觉悟的提高，机械使用比例的增加，合理化建议应该愈来愈多，而我们却是越来越少。工人批评我们对合理化建议的态度：“说在嘴上，写在纸上，交给干部没有下场。”保守思想还反映在使用机械这一问题上。去年上级要调拨给我们一批施工机械，我们怕背包袱，拒绝了，并且还封存了很多原有的可以使用的机械。我们以前认为机械施工成本高，事实并不是这样。最近孟庆元同志所领导的机械工程队，在进行站场施工的时候，成本比人工施工的少22万多元。
    在检查和批判了右倾保守思想之后，我们根据全面规划、加强领导的方针，改变了工作方法。首先，我们同设计院、基建分局召开了平衡会议，解决了设计部门和施工部门之间的协作配合问题。过去，大部分设计文件的供应，常常集中在三、四季度。这样就使得我们很难均衡地安排生产，对于一些陆续要开工的工程不能事前正确地进行准备。有时设计单位交来的文件，同我们原先的施工组织设计不一致。在这个会议上，设计部门先介绍了全年的工程量、工程进度、施工方法，和文件供应时间，使大家对今年的工程有了轮廓的了解，然后又详细地讨论第一季度的工程。我们根据施工的要求提出我们的意见，由设计部门予以考虑，适当调整了一些文件的供应时间，这样施工设计之间便一致起来了。今年第一季度的工程量达到15％，并且可以着手为第二季度进行一些准备工作，缩短第二季度的施工准备时间。其他三个季度工程数量的安排，也大体接近平衡。
    其次，我们加强了施工组织设计的编制工作。过去，这个工作由施工组织设计科来做，只有简单的施工进度、施工方法和很粗糙的劳动力需要量。这样的施工组织设计，不能切实有效地指导生产，不能把各部门的力量组织起来，为工程服务。所以，有时运输部门没有把材料及时运到工地，成品厂没有及时供应成品，机械设备没有及时调配到。今年，我们先派工作组到沿线了解了施工地区的特点和条件，再根据平衡会议的结果，召集计划、技术、施工、材料、机械、运输、附属企业等部门的负责人和主要工程师，详细讨论今年的工程任务，对工程（特别是重点工程）进度作出具体要求，然后再研究完成计划过程中所应该解决的问题。这样就使各部门明确了自己的职责，心里有了底，可以有预见地解决问题。如桥梁成品的供应，以前我们认为问题不大，这次发现缺的很多。加工厂现在已经着手扩大设备，解决这个矛盾。
    第三，做好先进经验的推广工作和合理化建议工作，把群众劳动热情更好地组织起来。我们决定在工程局成立先进经验推广科，在每一个区队都成立生产委员会和合理化建议委员会，加强对劳动竞赛的具体领导，组织技术人员帮助工人解决技术改进中的问题。工地上还将成立先进经验训练班，组织示范、表演及经验交流会，传播先进的工作方法。
    经过这些努力以后，在职工建设社会主义社会热情空前高涨下，加上有关方面的密切配合，我们一定胜利完成今年施工任务。
