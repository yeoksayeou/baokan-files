    With a Mind to Learn, One Need Not Fear Old Age
    Zhao Yu'e Speaks

    My name is Zhao Yu'e, and I live in Hengshan Village, Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province. I am fifty-four years old this year. Now, I will share with you my experience of learning to read and write.

    In the past, I was an illiterate who couldn't recognize a single character. Because I couldn't read, I suffered a lot. Before liberation, my husband had no choice but to sell tofu and brooms in the winter to make a living. When he sold something, he couldn't keep records, relying only on his memory. Over time, he would forget if people paid too little or too much. He blamed me for having a bad memory, and I complained that his mind was muddled. We often argued. From then on, I understood the importance of learning to read and write. But in the old society, we couldn't even feed ourselves, so how could we have the mind to learn? After liberation, our lives gradually improved, and women also gained equality. My interest in learning to read and write grew. I kept saying to myself, "If only I could learn to read and write someday!" Sure enough, in 1951, our village established a winter literacy school, and I actively participated in the learning. In 1952, our village was going to promote the "Rapid Literacy Method." I heard that this method was good, allowing one to recognize many characters and learn quickly. I was extremely happy and was the first to sign up to participate in the learning. At that time, the villagers ridiculed me, saying, "An old donkey with no teeth still wants to pull a cart! What are you, an old woman, learning to read and write for?" The teacher also thought that I would be working hard for nothing. But I was not discouraged by this. On the contrary, it inspired my determination to learn. I believed that as long as I was determined, I could achieve results, contribute greatly to production, and the masses would no longer laugh at me. Therefore, I repeatedly asked the teacher to accept me into the school. Seeing my great determination, the teacher allowed me to attend as an auditing student. From then on, I began to learn to read and write.

    I started learning in the tenth lunar month of 1952. We crammed three letters a day. At that time, because I was an auditing student, I was not given textbooks. Every day after studying, I would write the letters on the wall of the kang (heated brick bed). Whenever I had time, I would read them, once, twice, three times. After reading them several times, I slowly remembered them. When I learned the letters ㄚㄛㄜㄝ (a, o, e, ê in pinyin), my tongue wouldn't obey, and I couldn't pronounce them correctly no matter what. I was really anxious. I thought, "Am I really unable to learn to read and write?" Then I thought, "I am old and cannot be compared to young people. Young people learn it once, but I have to learn it ten times, a hundred times. If I learn it many times, I will naturally learn it." Thinking of this, my confidence grew again. So I went to the teacher to teach me to pronounce them, and after pronouncing them several times, I finally got the pronunciation correct. I was very happy. A few days later, we began to cram pinyin, and my difficulties came again. When I was trying to pronounce ㄓㄚ (zhā) for "炸" (zhá, to fry), 彳ㄚ (chā) for "差" (chā, difference), and 尸ㄚ (shā) for "啥" (shá, what), others could distinguish them, but when it came to me, it was always "zhá, zhá, zhá." Everyone laughed, and the more they laughed, the less I could pronounce it correctly. After class, I went to the teacher again, and after teaching me three times, I finally distinguished them. That's how I was. If I didn't know something, I would ask. Once I knew it, I would recite it endlessly. Finally, I completed the first stage of learning. Seeing my good academic performance, the teacher allowed me to become a formal student. From then on, my enthusiasm for learning grew even greater.

    In the second stage, we crammed new characters. We had to recognize seventy-two new characters every day. When I looked at the book, I was scared by the large black mass of characters. I thought, "How can someone as old as me remember so many characters? With 'crutches' (phonetic symbols), I can still spell out the sounds, but without 'crutches,' I won't recognize them." At this time, I still held the attitude that if I didn't know something, I would ask. Sometimes I would ask people ten or a hundred times, and I still couldn't remember. Later, I thought that relying solely on others for help was not a long-term solution. So I used the furniture at home to help me recognize the characters. For example, when recognizing the character "碗" (wǎn, bowl), I would hold a rice bowl in my left hand and a book in my right hand, reciting the character repeatedly. Similarly, when recognizing characters such as "盆" (pén, basin) and "犁" (lí, plow), I would look at the basin and plow while reciting them. Usually, when I saw these furniture, I would think about what the characters for these furniture looked like. In this way, I slowly remembered them. But some characters could not be helped by furniture to help me remember, such as the characters "惧" (jù, to fear) and "捧" (pěng, to hold). I used the names of people in the village to help me remember. For example: I used the "巨" (jù) from the name of Ju Tang in the village to help me remember the character "惧" (jù). I also used the method of memorizing radicals to help me remember. For example, for the character "魏" (Wèi), I remembered that left is 委 (wěi) and right is 鬼 (guǐ), so that is 魏 (Wèi). For particularly difficult characters, I would turn them over in my mind even when I was lying on the kang at night. When I woke up in the middle of the night and remembered the difficult characters, I would recite them and write them on my chest with my fingers. In this way, after a month, I learned more than two thousand characters and completed the learning task on schedule.

    After cramming new characters, we started learning to write. I am old and clumsy, and the characters I wrote were either high on the left and low on the right, crooked, or missing strokes. They really didn't look like characters. At this time, I felt a little discouraged. I thought that old people could still learn to recognize characters, but they couldn't learn to write. Later, the teacher gave me a copybook with the following written on it: "Study hard and practice diligently, strive to learn with enthusiasm, with culture and knowledge, improve awareness and thought quickly, learning is not a loss for old people." After reading it, it gave me great encouragement, and my enthusiasm grew again. I blamed myself for being too impatient. Learning to write is also a slow process. As the saying goes, "First time strange, second time familiar, third time no need for a master." So I used the writing method taught by the teacher: "First top then bottom, first left then right, first enter the house then close the door." I insisted on writing one large copybook every day. In this way, I slowly learned to write.

    I know that to learn well, one must always persevere and cannot be like "three days of fishing, two days of drying the nets." People often say: "An old ox pulling a cart is not afraid of being slow, only afraid of stopping. One stop is two and a half li less." But because my family lacks labor, I have an old mother who is eighty-three years old, and an older sister who is blind in both eyes. My husband, because he used to work long hours for the landlord, has also ruined his health and can only contribute half a laborer. Most of the housework and fieldwork fall on me, so I have very little time to study. At that time, I thought that it was impossible to set aside time specifically for studying. So I studied while working. When working in the fields, whether it was weeding, hoeing, or picking cotton, or harvesting and threshing, I always kept my textbooks in my pocket. When I had time, when others were resting, I would take out my textbooks to study. The land was my slate, my fingers were my pen, and my mouth recited the words in the book, while my fingers traced the characters on the ground. At home, when I was spinning, sewing, or cooking, I would not leave my textbooks either. I would do my work while looking at the books, silently thinking about the appearance of the characters and the meaning of the sentences. Usually, when I walked down the street, I would not relax my studies either. I would walk while looking at the slogans, notices, and couplets on the walls and doors. When I encountered new characters, I would write them down and ask literate people until I learned them.

    Now our village's cooperative has been transformed into an advanced cooperative. In the future, the cooperative will use machines for production. I feel that my level of literacy is still far from enough. People often say, "One can never stop learning as long as one lives." So I plan to work harder to study further. Now I have joined the senior primary class. Although I am fifty-four years old this year, my heart is still young. If I can live to be eighty years old, I still have thirty years of things to do! So I must shake off my old spirit and sell my old strength to add a share of strength to the motherland.

    有心学习不怕老
    赵玉娥讲
    我叫赵玉娥，家在山西定襄县横山村，今年五十四岁了。现在，我把我怎样学习文化的情形给大家介绍一下。
    过去，我是个一字不识的文盲。因为不识字，吃了不少的苦头。解放以前，我的老汉到冬天没办法，就靠卖豆腐和卖扫帚过日子。卖出去东西不会记，只凭心记，人家短多短少，时间长了就忘了。他怨我记性不好，我嫌他脑子糊涂，我们两口子经常争吵。从那时起，我就知道了学文化的重要。但是在旧社会里，连嘴都顾不住，那有心思学文化呢？解放以后，我们的生活渐渐好了，妇女们也翻了身，我学文化的兴趣也就来了。我天天叨念着那天咱能学文化就好了。果然在1951年我们村里建立了冬学民校，我就积极参加了学习。到1952年，我们村里要推行“速成识字法”，我听说这个方法好，认字多，学得快，我真是高兴极了，第一个报名要求参加学习。当时村里人都取笑我说：“没牙的老驴还想拉车呢，你这老太太学下文化干啥呀！”教员也认为我是白下辛苦不顶事。但是我并没有因此泄气，相反地，我更激发了学习的决心。我认为只要自己有决心，学下成绩，能在生产上顶大事，群众就不取笑我了。因此我就到学校再三要求教员收下我。教员见我决心挺大，就允许我当旁听学员。从此我就开始学习文化了。
    我是在1952年阴历十月开始学习的。一天突击三个字母。那时因为我是个旁听学员，所以没有给我发书本子，我每天学习回来，就把字母写在炕头墙上，一有空就念，一遍、两遍、三遍，多念几遍慢慢就记住了。当学到ㄚㄛㄜㄝ字母的时候，我的舌头不听使唤，怎样也念不会，心里真是着急。我想我莫非真是不能学文化了？又一想，我这大年纪，不能和年青人比，青年人学一遍，我得学十遍、百遍，学的遍数多了，自然就学会了。想到这里，我的信心就又大了。于是我就去找老师教我念，念了好几遍才把音念正了，我心里可高兴。不几天就突击拼音，我的困难又来了。在拼ㄓㄚ炸、彳ㄚ差、尸ㄚ啥的时候，别的人都能分清，临到我念的时候就是炸、炸、炸。逗的大家就是笑，越笑我越念不上来。下了课我又去找老师教了三遍才分清了。我就是这样，不会就问，会了就不住嘴地念，终于完成了第一阶段的学习任务。老师看着我的学习成绩好，就让我转为正式学员。从此，我的学习劲头更大了。
    到了第二阶段，就突击认生字，每天要认七十二个生字，我一看书里边黑鸦鸦的一大片，就吓了一大跳。我想我这么大年纪的人那能记住这么多生字，有“拐棍”（注音符号）还能照着拼出音来，没有“拐棍”我就不认识了。这时，我还是抱着不会就问的态度。有时十次百次地去问人，还记不住。后来我想光依靠别人帮助也不是个长久办法，于是我就用家里的家具来帮助认字。譬如认“碗”字的时候，我就左手拿着饭碗，右手拿着书，连声地念。又如认“盆”、“犁”等生字的时候，我都是看着盆、犁念。平时我看见了这些家具以后，就想想这些家具的字是啥样子。这样慢慢地就记住了。可是有些字不能用家具来帮助我记忆，如“惧”字和“捧”字，我就用村里的人名来帮助我记忆。例如：用村里的巨堂的“巨”字帮助我记“惧”字。我还用了记部首偏旁的办法来帮助我记忆。如“魏”字，我记住左委右鬼就是魏。对于特别难认的字，我晚上躺到炕上也要在脑子里转，睡到半夜醒来想起难认的字，还要念一念，并且用手指在胸前写一写。就是这样，经过一个月的时间，我就学会了两千多个字。按期完成了学习任务。
    突击了认生字以后，就开始学习写字。我年老手笨，写出个字，不是左肩高，右肩低，七叉八歪地，就是丢胳膊掉腿，真不像个样子。这时我有点泄气。我认为老年人学认字还可以，学写字就不行了。后来老师给了我一张仿引，上面写着：“苦学苦练要用功，争取学习起上劲，有了文化和知识，提高觉悟思想快，学习不亏老年人。”我看了以后给了我很大鼓舞，劲头又大起来。我埋怨自己心太急了，学写字也是慢慢学会的。俗话说：“一遍生，两遍熟，三遍不用老师傅。”于是我运用了老师教的“先上后下，先左后右，先入屋子后关门”的写字方法，每天坚持写一张大仿。这样一来，慢慢也就会写了。
    我知道，要想学习好，必须得经常坚持学习，不能三天打鱼，两天晒网。人常说：“老牛拉车不怕慢，只怕站，站一站少走二里半。”可是因为我家里缺乏劳动力，有一个老母亲，已经八十三岁了，有一个姐姐双眼都瞎了，我老汉因为过去给地主扛长活，把身子也折磨坏了，只能顶半个劳动力，家务活计和田间的劳动大部都落到我一人身上，学习时间很少。那时我想如果专门抽出时间来学习，是根本办不到的。所以我就一面劳动，一面学习。下地里劳动的时候，不管是薅苗、锄苗、打切棉花，也不管是收割和打场，我衣服口袋里总要装着课本，有了空，别人休息了，我就掏出书本学习，土地就是我的石板，指头就是笔，嘴里念着书上的字，手指就在地上比划着写。在家里纺织、做针线、或是烧火做饭的时候，我也不离开课本，一面做着活，一面看着书本，心里暗暗地琢磨着字样和句子的意思。平时我就是走到街上，也不放松学习，一面走，一面看着墙上、门上的标语、公告和对联上的句子，遇见生字就把它记下来，问识字的人，直到学会为止。
    现在我们村的合作社，已经转为高级社，将来社里要用机器生产，我觉得我的文化还是很不够用的，人常说：“学到老，学不了。”所以我打算要进一步努力学习，现在我已经参加了高小班学习。我今年虽然是五十四岁的人了，可是我的心还是年青的，我假如能够活到八十多岁，我还有三十年的事要做哩！所以我还要抖抖我的老精神，卖卖我的老力气，为祖国增添一份力量。
