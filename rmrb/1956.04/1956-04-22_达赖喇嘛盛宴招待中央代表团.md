He said, "I believe that with the personal guidance and assistance of the Central Delegation, the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will be a complete success, and the relationship between the Central Government and the Tibetan local government will be even closer in the future." In conclusion, he expressed his hope that the delegation would stay in Tibet for a longer period and provide more assistance and guidance to the work in Tibet.

In Lhasa, we not only do not feel estranged, but we also feel very close." He proposed a toast to the two leaders of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni.

Also attending the banquet as honored guests were the Kalons of the Tibetan local government, the members of the Panchen Kampus Assembly, the responsible persons of the Changdu Area People's Liberation Committee, the responsible persons of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the responsible persons of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
