Beijing’s vast number of young machinists are currently engaged in a movement to learn advanced lathe tool methods, striving to become youth shock workers.

　　Young machinists at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory have already popularized six advanced lathe tool methods, including those of Unanov and Kolesov. Planer operator and Communist Youth League member Shao Zhongheng, after recently learning the advanced experience of the Soviet "Miraculous Planer Tool Method," improved the old-fashioned planer tool he used in the past, increasing production efficiency fourfold.

　　The young lathe operators in the factories of Dongsi District have been carrying out an advanced lathe tool method learning campaign month since March 20. Now, more than 80% of young lathe operators have learned and used an advanced lathe tool or made an improvement. The Dongsi District Committee of the Communist Youth League held a "Lathe Tool Evening" on April 3, where nine young people who had made significant achievements in learning advanced lathe tools were rewarded.
