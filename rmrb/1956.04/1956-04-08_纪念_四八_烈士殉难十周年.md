    Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Martyrdom of the "April 8th" Martyrs
    Li Wen
    Ten years ago today, Comrades Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Ye Ting, and Deng Fa, and Mr. Huang Qisheng, a sincere friend of the Chinese Communist Party, unfortunately died in a plane crash. This was a major loss for our Party and the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never forget their revolutionary spirit and contributions to the revolution.

    The "April 8th" Martyrs were outstanding sons of the Chinese people. Among them, Comrade Wang Ruofei was one of the founders of our Party. He possessed rich political experience and outstanding organizational skills, had experienced long-term arduous struggles and tests, and demonstrated heroic and steadfast noble qualities in the struggle. Comrade Qin Bangxian was an excellent propaganda worker of the Party. He made great contributions in translating and introducing Marxist-Leninist works. Comrade Ye Ting was a famous military strategist. He made meritorious contributions in the Northern Expedition, persisted in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in Central China, and demonstrated an indomitable revolutionary spirit after being captured in the Southern Anhui Incident. Comrade Deng Fa was a veteran labor movement activist. He was a heroic fighter in the Guangdong-Hong Kong Strike and a leader of the Chinese workers' movement. Mr. Huang Qisheng was an advanced veteran educator who had been engaged in activities to fight for China's democratic reform since the Wuxu Coup. After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, he always remained a close friend of our Party.

    The martyrdom of the "April 8th" Martyrs was caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to undermine the return of power to the Political Consultative Conference. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the Kuomintang reactionaries tried their best to launch a civil war. Comrades Wang Ruofei and others waged unremitting struggles with the reactionaries in order to save peace. Especially in the two months before their martyrdom, Wang Ruofei and Qin Bangxian comrades waged resolute struggles with the reactionaries in order to protect the five resolutions of the then Old Political Consultative Conference and oppose undermining the truce agreement. On April 8th, they flew back to Yan'an to report to and ask for instructions from the Central Committee of our Party on the issue of "peace talks," but unfortunately encountered disaster in the middle of the journey due to a plane crash.

    These sacrificed martyrs were outstanding revolutionary activists. They did a lot of beneficial work for the people and won the trust and support of the people. They contributed their lives for China's peace and democracy and for the cause of the people's liberation. Their spirit is great. As Comrade Mao Zedong said:
  “For decades, you have done a magnificent job for the people's cause. Today, you died for the people's cause, and although you are dead, you are glorious!”

    Today, the new China that the "April 8th" martyrs yearned for has been established, and the people of the whole country are carrying out the great cause of socialist construction. The ultimate goal of the Chinese Communists is to realize the communist system in China, and we will never forget this goal. All the martyrs who sacrificed in the past revolutionary period will be eternally remembered by us and our descendants. Their spirit will live forever, and their names will always encourage and spur us on to move forward.

    纪念“四八”烈士殉难十周年
    李文
    十年前的今天，王若飞、秦邦宪、叶挺和邓发诸同志，中国共产党的真挚朋友黄齐生先生，不幸因飞机失事而殉难。这是我们党和中国人民的一个重大的损失。他们的革命精神和对革命的贡献，中国人民将永志不忘。
    “四八”烈士是中国人民的优秀儿子。其中，王若飞同志是我们党的创始人之一，他具有丰富的政治经验和出色的组织才能，曾经历过长期的艰苦的斗争和考验，并在斗争中表现出英勇坚强的崇高品质。秦邦宪同志是党的优秀的宣传工作者。他在翻译和介绍马克思列宁主义著作方面，有很大的贡献。叶挺同志是一位有名的军事家。他在北伐战争中建有功勋，在抗日战争中坚持华中敌后抗战，皖南事变被俘后，表现了坚贞不屈的革命精神。邓发同志是一位老的职工运动家，他是省港罢工的英勇战士，是中国工人运动的领导人。黄齐生先生是一位先进的老教育家，从戊戌政变起就从事争取中国民主改革的活动。中国共产党成立后，他始终是我们党的亲密朋友。
    “四八”烈士的殉难是由国民党反动派破坏归政协的阴谋所引起的。当抗日战争胜利以后，国民党反动派竭力发动内战，王若飞等同志为了挽救和平，和反动派进行了不懈的斗争。特别是在他们殉难前的两个月中，为了保护当时旧政协的五项决议，反对破坏停战协定，王若飞和秦邦宪两位同志同反动分子作了坚决的斗争。四月八日，为了向我们党的中央报告和请示“和平谈判”的问题，他们飞回延安，不幸途中却因飞机失事蒙难。
    这些牺牲的先烈，是杰出的革命活动家。他们为人民做了很多有益的工作，获得了人民的信仰和拥护。他们为中国的和平民主，为人民的解放事业而贡献了自己的生命。他们的精神是伟大的。正如毛泽东同志所说：
  “数十年间，你们为人民事业做了轰轰烈烈的工作。今天，你们为人民事业而死，虽死犹荣！”
    今天，“四八”被难烈士所憧憬的新中国，已经建立了，全国人民正在进行着伟大的社会主义建设事业。中国共产党人的最终目标是在中国实现共产主义制度，我们永远不会忘了这个目标。在过去革命时期牺牲的一切先烈，都将为我们和我们的后代永志不忘。他们的精神永垂不朽，他们的名字永远鼓励和鞭策着我们前进。
