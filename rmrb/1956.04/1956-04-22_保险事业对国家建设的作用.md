    The Role of Insurance in National Construction

    Some readers have written to inquire: Why does our country operate insurance? What role does insurance play in national construction?

    Now, we will answer this question as follows:

    The purpose of the state in running insurance is mainly to ensure that individual economic sectors can receive timely compensation for economic losses after encountering natural disasters or accidents, so as to prevent production interruptions; and to ensure that people receive necessary material security after suffering accidents.

    Marx pointed out in "Critique of the Gotha Program" that the distribution of the total social product must include a portion used as a reserve fund or insurance fund to cope with natural disasters and accidents. Our country's insurance business, with the insurance fund accumulated from insurance premiums paid by participating units or individuals, is a component of the state's monetary reserve. In the Soviet Union, as early as 1921, Lenin signed a directive on handling state insurance, laying the foundation for the Soviet state insurance business. For more than thirty years, the Soviet state insurance business has played a significant positive role in ensuring socialist expanded reproduction and protecting the material welfare of workers. This proves that state-run insurance is indispensable in the entire socialist construction.

    Our country's insurance business has also developed steadily in the past six years. The People's Insurance Company of China has successively implemented compulsory insurance for state-owned enterprises and cooperatives; and has opened various voluntary insurance policies in cities, such as transportation insurance, fire insurance, and personal insurance; and has handled livestock insurance and crop insurance in rural areas. Through these insurance business activities, the People's Insurance Company of China has provided timely economic compensation to units and individuals who have suffered natural disasters or accidents. In agricultural insurance alone, from 1950 to 1953, approximately 950,000 head of livestock and more than 200,000 mu of crops received insurance claims due to losses. After the Yangtze and Huai River basins suffered unprecedented floods in 1954, 119 units in Wuhan alone received insurance claims of more than 2 million yuan. These insurance claims have played a certain role in ensuring the restoration and development of social production, reducing the burden on the state's finances, and supporting the stability of the state's financial budget.

    The insurance business run by the state not only compensates policyholders for losses suffered in disasters and accidents, but also cooperates with relevant departments to carry out work to prevent natural disasters and accidents. Part of the insurance premium income of the People's Insurance Company of China is used to allocate funds to fire departments and agricultural and animal husbandry departments to enrich local disaster prevention forces.

    In addition, the People's Insurance Company of China also turns over a portion of funds to the state, and provides usable funds for the state through the state's finance and credit system by accumulating insurance funds.

### 保险事业对国家建设的作用

    保险事业对国家建设的作用
    有些读者来信询问：我们国家为什么要办理保险事业？保险事业对国家建设有着什么作用？
    现在，我们对这个问题答复如下：
    国家举办保险事业的目的，主要是为了使个别经济部门在遭遇到自然灾害或意外事故以后，在经济上的损失能够及时得到补偿，不致于发生生产中断的现象；并且使人民在遭受意外以后物质福利得到必要的保障。
    马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中曾经指出，社会总产品的分配，必须有一部分用作应付自然灾害和意外事故的后备基金或保险基金。我们国家办理保险事业，由参加保险的单位或个人缴纳保险费所积累起来的保险基金，就是国家货币后备的一个组成部分。在苏联，列宁早在1921年就签署了关于办理国家保险的指令，给苏联国家保险事业奠定了基础；三十多年来，苏联的国家保险事业对于保证社会主义扩大再生产和保障劳动者的物质福利起了重大的积极的作用。这就证明国家举办的保险事业在整个社会主义建设中是必不可少的。
    我国的保险事业，在六年多来也有了稳步的发展。中国人民保险公司先后对国营企业、合作社实行了强制保险；在城市中开办了各种自愿保险，如运输保险、火灾保险和人身保险等；在农村办理了牲畜保险和农作物保险等。中国人民保险公司通过这些保险业务活动，对于遭受自然灾害或意外事故的单位和个人，及时地给了经济上的补偿。仅农业保险一项，在1950年到1953年的四年中，就约有九十五万头牲畜和二十多万亩农作物因遭受损失而获得保险赔款。在1954年长江、淮河两岸遭受百年来未有的洪水灾害以后，仅武汉一地就有119个单位得到保险赔款二百多万元。这些保险赔款对于保障社会生产的恢复和发展，以及减轻国家财政负担、支持国家财政预算的稳定，都起了一定的作用。
    国家举办的保险业务，不仅仅是补偿投保人在灾害事故中所受到的损失，还要同有关部门配合进行防止自然灾害和意外事故的工作。中国人民保险公司的保险费收入就有一部分是用来拨给消防部门和农业畜牧部门充实地方防灾力量的。
    此外，中国人民保险公司还对国家上缴一部分资金，并且把积累的保险基金通过国家财政、信贷体系等为国家提供可以运用的资金。
