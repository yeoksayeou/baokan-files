Launching the Advanced Producer Movement

    Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory Workers Produce High-Quality Textiles

    Workers at the Tianjin State-owned Cotton Textile Factories are launching an advanced producer movement for high-quality textiles.

    During the movement, workers in each factory are diligently studying advanced experiences to improve quality. After returning to their factories, some representatives who attended the Tianjin Municipal Advanced Cotton Textile Producer Representatives Conference also actively disseminated the advanced experiences summarized at the conference. Many workers in Shao Shujuan's group at Tianjin State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 6 and Gao Shuzhen's group at Tianjin State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 3 have learned the "smooth inlay wrapping method" for changing roving, which has improved the yarn's evenness. Spoolers in each factory are universally conducting "one hundred spindles without breaks" competitions. Many groups of workers in the yarn and cloth workshops of Tianjin State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 4 are strengthening technical mutual assistance and helping each other improve their skills through package teaching and guaranteed learning methods. Yu Shuhua, of the fine yarn C shift, who often failed to complete her plan in the past, has now not produced any bad yarn for three consecutive months, has completed her output plan, and has also taken the initiative to help Yang Shuangfeng improve her splicing method.

    Competition Among Joint State-Private Silk and Cloth Shops

    Since the implementation of industry-wide joint state-private ownership in February this year, silk and cloth shops in Shanghai have launched a universal inter-store labor competition. This labor competition, which lasted for more than two months, has enabled many silk and cloth shops to improve their service attitude towards consumers, and has been welcomed by customers. Recently, the industry conducted the first quarter labor competition evaluation. Among the 308 shops and more than 40 stalls in the city, 84 were rated as advanced units because of their improved service attitude, and 1,032 people were rated as advanced workers.

    Rectifier Made with Semiconductor Selenium

    A rectifier that uses semiconductor "selenium" to convert alternating current into direct current has been successfully trial-produced by Jiang Hanluo and other private technicians from Shanghai Joint State-Private Xingdong Electronic Industry Factory and other units.

    According to test results, this rectifier can be used for tens of thousands of hours, while ordinary electronic rectifier tubes can only be used for about one thousand hours. Various telecommunications appliances used in factories, mines, and transportation departments all need this rectifier.
