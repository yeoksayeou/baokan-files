New Achievements in Basic Construction

    The Main Workshop Project of the Tractor Factory Makes Rapid Progress
    The main workshop project of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant is progressing rapidly. Auxiliary workshops, the repair and casting workshop, and the general warehouse have all completed their wall construction. The forging workshop completed the installation of various components on April 1st. The engine workshop completed the first phase of earthwork and all concrete foundation work on April 4th, two days ahead of schedule. This year, the workers constructing the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant have promoted many key advanced experiences and created many operational methods to improve work efficiency in various types of work. For example, when laying the factory foundation, they used dry-hard concrete to pour the column bases, shortening the maintenance period of this project from more than 20 days to seven days, with excellent project quality, and saving 10% to 20% of cement. In earthwork projects, the large-scale use of mechanical soil transportation and mechanical surface compaction greatly improved work efficiency. In masonry projects, the use of mortar spreaders enabled most masonry teams to exceed their labor quotas.

    The Largest Die Forging Hammer in China Put into Production in the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant
    On the afternoon of the 13th, the forging workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant was filled with shocking impact sounds as China's largest die forging hammer, installed in the workshop, began production. The first batch of automobile crankshafts and front axles produced by this workshop have reached Soviet quality standards.
    There are more than 100 kinds of auto parts which need to be forged, among which the crankshaft and the front axle are the largest and most complex. Without a crankshaft, the engine cannot start. After this giant die forging hammer is put into production, it can produce the crankshafts needed for tens of thousands of cars every year.
    The die forging hammer uses molds for forging. A crankshaft can be forged in one and a half minutes using the die forging hammer. If a manually controlled steam hammer is used, even two crankshafts cannot be forged in a day, and the quality standards are also poor. Because the parts forged with dies have small machining allowances, it saves a large amount of metal and reduces machining time. The die forging hammer can also forge complex parts that ordinary steam hammers cannot forge. 　　　　(Xinhua News Agency)

    Capital to Build a Modern Glass Factory
    On the 14th, China's first modern scientific instrument glass factory, the Beijing Glass Factory, broke ground in the eastern suburbs of Beijing.
    This glass factory was designed by experts from the German Democratic Republic. The main equipment used in the factory, such as tube-making machines, ampoule machines, and crushing and mixing materials, are all new automatic equipment manufactured in the German Democratic Republic. The factory is divided into main workshops such as crushing, melting, processing, gas generator, dry distillation gas, and auxiliary workshops. According to the latest technology of the German Democratic Republic, it will produce glass instruments needed for scientific research and experimental work, including heat-resistant glass beakers, flasks, Erlenmeyer flasks, etc. In addition, it will also produce acid-resistant, alkali-resistant ground-mouth chemical reagent bottles, fine instruments for general industrial and mining laboratories, and hundreds of products such as various colored glasses and special glasses.
    This factory will be completed in the third quarter of 1957 and put into production in the fourth quarter.

    The Train Arrives in the Mountainous Area of Northern Fujian for the First Time
    The track-laying project of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway has entered Fujian Province from Jiangxi Province. A train full of steel, along streams and valleys, through tunnels, drove into the mountainous area of northern Fujian. The local people, seeing the train for the first time, held a welcome meeting with joy and presented large bunches of flowers to the railway soldiers.
    The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway was originally planned to be completed during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Because the railway soldiers and migrant workers building the road responded to the call to complete the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway ahead of schedule and enthusiastically launched a labor competition, it is possible for this railway to be fully opened to traffic this year.

    基本建设的新成就
    拖拉机厂主厂房工程进展迅速
    第一拖拉机制造厂的主厂房工程正在迅速地进展。辅助工场、修铸工场和总库房等厂房现在已经全部结束了砌墙工程。锻工场在四月一日完成了各种构件的安装任务。发动机工场在四月四日提前两天完成了第一期土方工程和全部混凝土基础工程。建设第一拖拉机制造厂的职工们，今年在各工种推广了许多带有关键性的先进经验和创造了许多提高工作效率的操作方法。例如在打厂房基础时，他们用干硬混凝土浇灌柱基，使这项工程的养护期限由二十多天缩短到七天，工程质量很好，并且节约了10％到20％的水泥。在土方工程中，大量采用机械运土和机械表面夯实的办法，大大提高了工作效率。在砌墙工程中，使用了铺灰器，使大多数泥工小组都突破了劳动定额。
    第一汽车制造厂中
    我国最大的模锻锤投入生产
    十三日下午，第一汽车制造厂锻工车间，洋溢着震人的冲击声，安装在这个车间中的我国最大的模锻锤开始生产了。这个车间所生产出的第一批汽车曲轴和前梁，已经达到了苏联的质量标准。
    汽车上需要锻造的零件有一百多种，其中以曲轴、前梁最大和最复杂。没有曲轴发动机就不能发动。这个巨型的模锻锤投入生产以后，每年能生产出几万辆汽车所需要的曲轴。
    模锻锤是用模子来锻造的。用模锻锤一分半钟就能锻造一个曲轴，如果用一般由手工控制的汽锤，一天连两个曲轴也锻制不出来，而且质量标准也差。由于用模锻锻出的零件加工余量小就能够节约大量金属，并且减少加工时间。用模锻锤还可以锻出一般汽锤无法锻造的复杂零件。　　　　（新华社）
    首都兴建一座近代化玻璃厂
    十四日，我国第一座近代化的科学仪器玻璃制造厂——北京市玻璃厂在北京东郊区破土开工。
    这座玻璃厂是由德意志民主共和国专家设计的。工厂用的制管机、安瓶机和粉碎调料等主要设备，都是德意志民主共和国制造的新式自动化设备。工厂分粉碎、熔制、加工、煤气发生炉、干熘煤气、辅助等主要车间。按照德意志民主共和国最新的技术，生产科学研究试验工作需要的玻璃仪器，其中有耐高温玻璃烧杯、烧瓶、三角瓶等。另外，还生产抗酸、抗碱的磨口化学试剂瓶，一般工矿试验室用的精细的仪器和各种颜色玻璃、特种玻璃等几百种产品。
    这座工厂将在1957年第三季度建成，第四季度投入生产。

    火车第一次开到闽北山区
    鹰厦铁路铺轨工程已经由江西进入福建省境。满载钢材的列车，沿着溪流峡谷，穿过隧道，开进闽北山区。第一次看到火车的当地人民，怀着喜悦的心情举行欢迎大会，把大把的鲜花送给铁道兵。
    鹰厦铁路原计划在第二个五年计划期间建成。由于筑路的铁道兵和民工响应提前修通鹰厦铁路的号召，热烈开展劳动竞赛，使这条铁路有可能提前在今年全线通车。
