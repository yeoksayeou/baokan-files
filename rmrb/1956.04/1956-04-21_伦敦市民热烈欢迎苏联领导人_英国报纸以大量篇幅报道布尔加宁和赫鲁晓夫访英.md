Xinhua News Agency, April 20th. TASS, London, April 19th: British newspapers have devoted extensive coverage to the news of Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain. The London Evening News of April 18th published a huge photograph of the Soviet leaders on the cruiser "Ordzhonikidze" upon their arrival in Britain, and detailed reports of the warm welcome they received from the British people at Victoria Station in London. All the evening papers devoted considerable space to Bulganin's speech at the station.

The London Morning Post, published on April 19th, devoted most of its columns to news and pictures of the Soviet leaders' arrival in Britain. "The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post," "The Daily Mail," and other newspapers published editorials on Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit. Most newspapers carried Bulganin's speech.

The "Daily Worker," in describing the reception of the Soviet leaders by the citizens of London, wrote: "Londoners thronged the streets to welcome Bulganin and Khrushchev. Victoria Station was surrounded by crowds. The road leading from the railway station was packed for half a mile. The first cheer of Londoners to the distinguished guests turned into a joyous sound, and the cheering continued as the guests left the station, until the distinguished guests disappeared from view."

James Cameron, a commentator for the "News Chronicle," wrote that Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain "is clearly an unusually important diplomatic event, which may well be a milestone in our contemporary history. We welcome Bulganin and Khrushchev, and we hope that they will be successful in their talks."

The "Daily Mail" said in an editorial that if "the visit means that gaps will be opened in the barriers, allowing the people of the two countries to interact more widely, then there is much to be said in favour of this visit." It said: "The British people will warmly welcome our two distinguished guests at the opportunity to meet them."

    伦敦市民热烈欢迎苏联领导人
    英国报纸以大量篇幅报道布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访英
    据新华社20日讯  据塔斯社伦敦十九日讯：英国报纸以大量篇幅报道布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫到英国访问的消息。四月十八日的伦敦晚报刊登了苏联领导人到达英国时在“奥尔忠尼启则号”巡洋舰上的巨幅照片和他们在伦敦维多利亚车站受到英国人热烈欢迎的详细报道。各家晚报都用很大的篇幅刊载布尔加宁在车站上发表的演说。
    四月十九日出版的伦敦晨报大多数都用好几栏的地位刊载苏联领导人到达英国的新闻和图片。“每日电讯与晨邮报”、“每日邮报”和其他报纸都发表了关于布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问的社论。大多数报纸刊载了布尔加宁的演说。
    “工人日报”在描写伦敦市民对苏联领导人的接待的时候写道：“伦敦市民群集街头，欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。维多利亚车站四周都是人群。从火车站出来的路上，整整有半哩路挤得水泄不通。伦敦市民向贵宾们致敬的第一声欢呼变成了一片欢腾的声音，当客人们离开火车站时，欢呼的声音还在响个不停，直到贵宾们的踪影消失为止。”
    “新闻纪事报”评论员詹姆斯·卡马仁写道，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的访问英国“显然是一件不寻常的重要外交活动，这未尝不可能是我们当代历史的里程碑。我们欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫，我们希望他们在会谈中得到成功”。
    “每日邮报”在社论中说，如果“访问意味着将会在障壁上打开缺口，使两国人民得以更加广泛地交往，那么赞成这次访问的话是可以说得很多的”。它说：“英国人民在有机会见到我们的两位贵宾的场合，将热情地欢迎他们。”
