    Streamlining Reports and Forms
    The Northwest Engineering Management Bureau, during its recent inspection of grassroots work, discovered that work areas and sections were required to regularly fill out 120 types of reports and forms. One of these forms had over 1,280 numbers, and it would take a person forty hours using an electric calculator to clearly compute the numbers on the form. Every report and form required someone to compile statistics, someone to fill it out, and had to be reviewed by leadership. The Northwest Engineering Management Bureau helped the work areas and sections reduce the 120 types of reports and forms to 55. Depending on the situation, it may be possible to reduce them further.
    Although many units have repeatedly demanded the streamlining of reports and forms, the phenomenon of excessive reports and forms is still quite common. If reports and forms are too numerous and too complex, the people filling them out become overwhelmed, and the reports and forms are prone to errors. This not only makes them unusable as a basis for guiding practical work, but also leads to a waste of manpower and materials. Therefore, when leading organs send people to inspect the work of grassroots units, they should also understand this situation, help grassroots units streamline those redundant and unnecessary reports and forms, and reduce the burden on personnel directly or indirectly involved in report and form work, so as to concentrate efforts on doing the necessary report and form work well.

    精简表报
    西北工程管理总局在最近检查基层工作中，发现工区和工段要经常填报120种表报。其中一种表上有1，280多个数字，一个人用电动计算机计算，需要四十个小时才能把表上的数字算清楚。每一张表报都需要人统计，要人填写，并且要经过领导人员审查。西北工程管理总局帮助工区、工段，把120种表报减少到55种。看情况，还可以再减少一些。
    许多单位虽然一再要求精简表报，可是表报过多的现象还相当普遍。表报过多过复杂，填表报的人就忙不过来，表报也会出错。这不仅不能用以作指导实际工作的依据，还造成人力物力的浪费。所以，领导机关派人检查基层单位工作的时候，也应该了解这方面的情况，帮助基层单位精简那些重复的、不大必要的表报，减轻那些直接或间接做表报工作的人员的负担，以便集中力量把必需的表报工作作好。
