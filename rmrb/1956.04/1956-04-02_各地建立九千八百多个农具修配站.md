Across the country, handicraft production cooperative departments are actively establishing agricultural tool repair stations according to the "establish stations by area" plan, to support farmers' spring plowing production. As of now, more than 9,800 agricultural tool repair stations and groups have been set up in sixteen provinces and regions, including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangxi, Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang. According to preliminary statistics from Hebei and Henan provinces, agricultural tool repair stations have already repaired nearly 900,000 large and small agricultural tools for farmers since the beginning of this year.

Most of these agricultural tool repair stations are established in market towns, central villages, and county towns. In order to facilitate farmers in remote villages, handicraft production cooperatives in various places have also organized mobile repair teams to carry out "appointment, scheduled, and fixed-point" mobile repairs in remote villages in a planned manner. Many agricultural tool repair stations have signed combined repair and supply contracts with production cooperatives.

    各地建立九千八百多个农具修配站
    全国各省、区手工业生产合作部门根据“以区建站”的规划，正在积极建立农具修配站，支援农民春耕生产。到目前为止，河北、河南、山东、山西、江苏、浙江、安徽、广西、吉林、辽宁和黑龙江等十六个省、区已经有了九千八百多个农具修配站、组。据河北、河南两省的初步统计，今年以来农具修配站已经为农民修配了近九十万件大小农具。
    这些农具修配站大都建立在集镇、中心乡村和县城。为了便利偏僻乡村的农民，各地手工业生产合作社还组织了流动修配小组，有计划的在偏僻乡村进行“预约、定期、定点”的流动修配。许多农具修配站同生产合作社签订了包修、包供结合合同。
