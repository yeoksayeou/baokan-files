Forced to "Take a Vacation" During the Busy Farming Season

To the Editor:

    On January 20th of this year, the General Bureau of Machinery Management of the Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice deciding to hold a mountain plow conference in Tianshui and Lanzhou, Gansu Province, from April 5th to 17th. The notice required agricultural departments of 19 provinces including Guizhou, Sichuan, Fujian, and Liaoning, as well as industrial departments, agricultural colleges, and planning commissions of relevant provinces to send administrative and technical cadres to attend on time. When the representatives attending the meeting arrived in Xi'an in early April, comrades from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture said that they had received a notice from the General Bureau of Machinery Management on April 4th, stating that the meeting was postponed to April 20th because the mountain plow conference and the rice transplanter conference conflicted in time.

    At that time, there were still more than ten days before the meeting. If the representatives attending the meeting returned and came back again, it would be a waste of time and travel expenses. Therefore, they had to stay in Xi'an to wait for the meeting. Thus, during the current spring plowing season, these dozens of representatives were forced to abandon their intense work and were idly waiting in Xi'an.

    In fact, the rice transplanter conference was also convened by the General Bureau of Machinery Management, and the meeting notice was issued as early as two months ago. Why did the same department organize two nationwide important meetings at the same time? Why was the notice postponing the mountain plow conference issued only at the last minute? The General Bureau of Agricultural Machinery should examine this matter and learn from it, and strengthen planning when organizing meetings in the future.

### 农忙季节被迫“休假”

    农忙季节被迫“休假”编辑同志：
    今年一月二十日，农业部机械管理总局发出通知，决定四月五日到十七日在甘肃省天水、兰州两地举行山地犁会议，要贵州、四川、福建、辽宁等十九个省的农业厅和有关省的工业厅、农学院和计划委员会等部门派行政干部、技术干部按时出席。当出席会议的代表在四月初到达西安之后，陕西省农业厅的同志说：四月四日接到了机械管理总局的通知，因为山地犁会议和插秧机会议时间冲突，所以会议推迟到四月二十日开始。
    这时候，距开会日期还有十多天。出席会议的代表如果回去再来，只是白白浪费时间和旅费，因此只好留在西安等待开会。这样，在目前春耕季节，这几十个代表却被迫丢开紧张的工作，在西安闲得发慌。
    其实，插秧机会议也是机械管理总局召开的，开会通知也是早在两个月以前就发出的。为什么同一个部门在相同的时间要组织两个全国性的重要会议呢？为什么推迟山地犁会议的通知要到临时才发呢？农业机械总局应该检查这件事，并且从中吸取教训，在今后组织会议的时候要加强计划性。
