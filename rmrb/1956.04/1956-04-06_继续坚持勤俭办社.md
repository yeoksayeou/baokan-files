    Continue to Uphold Diligence and Thrift in Running Cooperatives
    Wang Guofan, Director of Jianming Agricultural, Forestry, and Livestock Production Cooperative, Zunhua County, Hebei Province
    Our Xipu Township is a mountain village with more mountains than land and more rocks than soil. In the spring of 1952, we twenty-three poor peasant households established an agricultural, forestry, and livestock cooperative. At that time, we only had three donkeys, and the wealthy people called us the "pauper cooperative." Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, all cooperative members have worked hard, ran the cooperative diligently and thriftily, and changed our poor condition. Grain output has increased from 120 jin per mu in the past to 305 jin, not only achieving self-sufficiency but also selling more than 30,000 jin of surplus grain; 1,400 mu of barren mountains and 600 mu of sandy wasteland have become green forests; more than 600 mu of terraced fields have also been planted with fruit trees; and we have accumulated public property worth more than 12,000 yuan, including thirty-two head of livestock, fourteen pigs, 103 sheep, five carts, and other farm tools. This January, our township's four elementary cooperatives merged and upgraded into a fully socialist cooperative.
    After the merger and upgrade, a few leaders and general members in the cooperative, especially the new members, used the excuse of engaging in large-scale production to advocate extravagance. They were unwilling to accept the 102 donkeys privately owned by the members, advocating selling them off to exchange for large mules and horses; advocating selling iron-wheeled carts and replacing them with rubber-tired carts; advocating abandoning old-fashioned farm tools all at once and using new-style farm tools entirely; and advocating replacing all livestock halters, reins, and old furniture with "all new ones." They believed that: without doing so, it would not look like an advanced cooperative; if the cooperative did not have the strength to do it, it should request loans from the government. In response to this ideological situation, we educated the members with the vivid facts of how the Jianming Cooperative started with diligence and thrift, and required every member to continue to carry forward the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative, and explained the relationship between increasing production and saving: we cannot produce with one hand and waste with the other; only by combining increased production and saving can we increase the actual income of the members. We also calculated the accounts: a mule is worth more than 500 yuan, and a donkey is only worth 50 or 60 yuan, so we have to sell ten donkeys to exchange for one mule; and in terms of use, one mule can never be as good as ten donkeys; moreover, there are not so many mules now, and donkeys and cattle are still indispensable power sources now and for a considerable period in the future. In this way, we unified the thinking of all members and proposed the slogan "Carry forward the glorious tradition of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative." This slogan immediately became the action program of every member. For example, in the cooperative's people's school, there are more than 420 students and twenty-seven kang-head study groups. There are many people studying at night, and they need gasoline lamps and lamp oil; in order to save the cooperative's expenses, the students proposed to also "go to the mountains to fetch" (gather firewood). They used their spare time to gather a total of 24,500 jin of firewood, sold it for 196 yuan, and bought four gasoline lamps and 200 jin of kerosene. Everyone said: "We are helping study with production."
    At the same time, we conducted education on hard work for the members, and according to the conditions of our cooperative, we tapped into the potential for production. This year, the planned grain yield per mu is 595 jin, an increase of 95% compared to last year (based on the average production level of the four cooperatives before the merger, the same below); the cotton yield per mu is 65 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 75% compared to last year; the peanut yield per mu is 400 jin, an increase of 81% compared to last year. The measures to ensure increased production, in addition to fully promoting close planting and improving technical management, include applying 10,000 to 15,000 jin of fertilizer per mu; opening and expanding three new canals, and digging and boring fourteen wells, expanding the irrigated land from 190 mu to 1,112 mu, basically turning the irrigable land into paddy fields; and building eighteen slow-flow dams. The cooperative also has 2,500 mu of barren mountains, and this year we will plant trees on 1,000 mu, and green all of it next year; and there are 300 mu of terraced fields, and this year we will plant all of them with fruit trees (we have already cultivated seedlings on seven mu). In order to realize this plan, the members launched a production competition with high enthusiasm, and set off an unprecedented production upsurge. The number of people participating in various production activities every day reached 1,478, in addition to all male and female full and semi-laborers participating, people with light labor also participated. Young and middle-aged people dug wells, opened canals, and dug black mud, while some women and old people collected manure, burned fertilizer, and swept street soil. By February, the cooperative had accumulated more than 50 million jin of fertilizer, an average of 8,500 jin per mu. Four wells have been dug, and two canals have been expanded and repaired, which can irrigate a total of 642 mu of land; stones are being prepared early for the slow-flow dams and are under construction. More than 73,000 squash mounds have been dug, which can produce 109,500 jin of squash. Trees have been planted on fifty mu of barren mountains, and more than 13,000 trees have been replanted in the sandy forest. In addition, 684,000 jin of firewood have been gathered.
    In order to continue to adhere to running the cooperative with diligence and thrift, save expenses, eliminate waste, and ensure the increase of the actual income of the members, after discussion by the members, the following measures were adopted:
    (1) Livestock and vehicles should be appropriately distributed to the production teams. Each team has one mule, two cattle, four donkeys, and two iron-wheeled carts (some have one rubber-tired cart), contracting to plant and harvest 420 mu of land. The service life of livestock and vehicles is assessed, and the teams are contracted to maintain their value at depreciated prices.
    (2) The teams are contracted to manage livestock feed. It is stipulated that each mule and horse is fed 1.5 jin of feed per day, and each cattle and donkey is fed 1 jin per day. Adjustments are made appropriately according to the busy and slack seasons of agricultural work. During the busy season, each mule and horse is fed 2 jin per day, and each cattle and donkey is fed 1.5 jin per day. Each mule and horse is fed 15 jin of fodder per day, and each cattle and donkey is fed 9 jin per day. Each team designates a special person to feed them, ensuring "three diligences" (diligent in adding grass, diligent in watering, diligent in cleaning the shed) and "four cleanlinesses" (clean grass, clean feed, clean water, clean shed) to ensure that the livestock are healthy.
    (3) For various farm tools, large ones are depreciated and returned to the cooperative and distributed to the teams; medium-sized ones are owned privately and used jointly, maintaining their value; small ones are prepared and used by individuals. The farm tool repair fee is also contracted, averaging 1.3 jiao per mu, and 60 yuan per team per year.
    (4) Office supplies in the cooperative are purchased uniformly and used in a fixed quantity. Monthly expenses should not exceed 3 yuan at most.
    (5) Strictly follow financial expenditure procedures. Expenditures under 5 yuan are approved by the director, expenditures from 5 yuan to 50 yuan are approved by the management committee, and expenditures over 50 yuan are approved by the cooperative members' congress or members' meeting. All expenditures are cleared daily and settled monthly, and the accounts are announced to the members monthly and reviewed item by item.
    (6) Strict rewards and punishments. For all financial contracts, the team or individual is responsible for overruns, and 20% of the savings are returned to the cooperative, and 80% is awarded to the team or individual. Public property should be commended for its care and criticized for its lack of care; if there is any damage or loss, the responsibility and reasons should be investigated, and appropriate compensation should be made. Those who engage in embezzlement and theft will be strictly dealt with.

    继续坚持勤俭办社
    河北省遵化县建明农林牧生产合作社主任　王国藩
    我们西铺乡是一个山多地少、石多土薄的山村。在1952年春，我们二十三户贫农建立了一个农林牧合作社，当时仅有三条驴，富裕的人叫我们“穷棒子社”。几年来，在党的领导下，全体社员艰苦劳动，勤俭办社，改变了穷困的面貌。粮食产量由过去每亩120斤提高到305斤，不仅能够自足，而且卖余粮三万多斤；一千四百亩山荒、六百亩沙荒变成了绿林；六百多亩梯田也栽上果树；并且积累了牲畜三十二头、猪十四头、羊103只、车五辆及其他农具等共价值一万二千多元的公共财产。今年一月，我们全乡的四个初级社就合并升级，成为一个全社会主义的合作社。
    在合并升级以后，社里有少数领导人员和一般社员，特别是新社员，借口搞大生产，主张闹阔气。对社员私有的102头驴不愿接收，主张外卖换回大骡大马；主张卖掉铁轮车，换上胶皮车；主张一下子废弃旧式农具，全使新式农具；还主张把牲口笼头、缰绳及一切旧家具，全换上“一色新”。他们认为：不这样就不像高级社的样子；社没力量办，就该向政府请求贷款。针对这种思想情况，我们就以建明社勤俭起家的生动事实教育社员，要求每个社员继续发扬勤俭办社的精神，并且说明了增产和节约的关系：不能一只手生产来，另一只手浪费去；只有增产和节约结合起来，才能增加社员实际收入。我们还算了个账：一头骡子价值五百多元，一头驴只值五、六十元，得卖十头驴才能换回一头骡子；而在使用上，一头骡子怎么也顶不上十头驴；再说，现在也没有那么多骡子，驴、牛还是现在和将来相当长的时期内不可缺少的动力。这样，就统一了全体社员的思想，提出了“发扬勤俭办社的光荣传统”的口号。这口号立即成为每个社员的行动纲领。例如社里的民校，学员有420多人，还有二十七个炕头学习组，夜间学习人多，需要汽灯和灯油；为节省社里的开支，学员们提出也“到山上去取”（打柴）。他们利用自己的零星时间，共打柴二万四千五百斤，卖了196元，买了四个汽灯和二百斤煤油。大家说：“咱们是以生产助学习。”
    同时，对社员进行了艰苦劳动的教育，并且根据我们社的条件，挖掘了生产潜力。今年计划粮食亩产595斤，比去年提高95％（按并社前四个社的平均生产水平作基础，下同）；棉花亩产皮棉六十五斤，比去年提高75％；花生亩产四百斤，比去年提高81％。保证增产的措施，除了全面推行密植和改进技术管理外，每亩施肥一万到一万五千斤；新开和扩开渠三道，打井、锥井十四眼，水浇地由190亩扩大到1，112亩，把能浇的地基本上变成水田；垒缓水坝十八道。全社还有荒山二千五百亩，今年要种树一千亩，明年全部绿化；还有梯田三百亩，今年全栽果树（已经育苗七亩）。为了实现这个计划，社员们以高度的热情展开了生产竞赛，掀起了空前未有的生产高潮。每天参加各种生产的人数，达到1，478人，除男女整半劳动力全部参加外，有轻劳力的人也参加了。青壮年打井、开渠、挖黑泥，一部分妇女和老头拾粪、烧肥、扫街土。到二月，全社已经积肥五千多万斤，每亩平均达到八千五百斤。打好井四眼，扩修好渠二道，共可浇地642亩；缓水坝早备石头，正在动工。挖了倭瓜垵七万三千多个，能产倭瓜十万零九千五百斤。在荒山种树五十亩，在沙荒林中补栽树一万三千多棵。此外，还打柴六十八万四千斤。
    为了继续坚持勤俭办社，节约开支，杜绝浪费，保证增加社员实际收入，经社员讨论，采取了以下办法：
    （一）牲畜、车辆适当分配到生产队。每队一头骡子、二头牛、四头驴、两辆铁轮车（有的一辆胶皮车），包种包收420亩地。对牲畜、车辆评议出使用年限，按折价由队包起来，保本保值。
    （二）牲畜草料由队包干。规定骡马每天每头喂料一斤半，牛驴每天每头一斤。按着农活闲忙适当调剂，农忙时骡马每天每头二斤，牛驴每天每头一斤半。饲草骡马每天每头十五斤，牛驴每天每头九斤。各队确定专人饲养作到“三勤”（勤添草、勤饮水、勤打扫棚）、“四净”（草净、料净、水净、棚净），保证牲畜健壮。
    （三）对各种农具，大型的折价归社，分配到队；中型的私有伙用，保本保值；小型的自备自用。农具修理费也包干，每亩地平均一角三分，每队全年六十元。
    （四）社内办公用具，统一购买，定量使用。每月开支最多不超过三元。
    （五）严格财务开支手续。五元以下由主任批准，五元至五十元由管理委员会批准，五十元以上由社代表大会或社员大会批准。各项开支作到日清月结，按月向社员公布账目，逐项审查。
    （六）奖惩严明。对各项财务包干，超过的由队或个人负责，节余的20％归社，80％奖励队或个人。对公共财产，爱护的表扬，不爱护的批评；如有损坏和遗失，追查责任和原因，适当赔偿。有贪污盗窃行为的严格处理。
