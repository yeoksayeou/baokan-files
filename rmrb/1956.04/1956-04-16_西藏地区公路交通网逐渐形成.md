Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 15th April: A road transport network is gradually forming in the Tibet region. Within Tibet, there are already nearly three thousand kilometers of highways and more than one thousand three hundred kilometers of motorable tracks. Before 1952, there wasn't a single proper road here. Now, from the west bank of the Jinsha River in eastern Tibet to Gada Ke in the westernmost Ali region, and from the Tanggula Mountains in the north to the important town of Yadong in the Himalayas in the south, vehicles can travel. Five major highway lines have connected the major cities and main agricultural and pastoral areas of Tibet. The famous Kangzang Highway and Qingzang Highway pass through Tibet's rich agricultural and pastoral areas, virgin forests, and abundant mineral areas, connecting Tibet with the interior of the motherland. The Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways run through the central Tibetan Plateau, connecting the two major economic centers of Tibet—Lhasa and Rikaze—as well as the famous handicraft city of Gyantse.

Since the full opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways, tens of thousands of tons of materials have been transported from all parts of the motherland to Tibet. Many modern factory equipment, large-scale agricultural machinery, and medical equipment that could not be transported in the past have begun to be used in Tibet. Tibet's rich local products, specialties, and animal products have also begun to be exported in large quantities. Passenger transport services have been opened on all the major highway lines in Tibet, greatly facilitating exchanges between people in various places. The long journey of more than 3,000 kilometers from eastern to western Tibet, which used to take two years for a round trip due to the heavy snow mountains and rivers, now only takes more than two months by car.

    西藏地区公路交通网逐渐形成
    据新华社拉萨15日电　西藏地区的公路交通网正在逐渐形成。在西藏境内，已经有近三千公里公路和一千三百多公里的汽车便道。1952年以前，这里还从来没有过一条正式公路。现在，从西藏东部的金沙江西岸到最西部阿里地区的噶大克，从北部唐古拉山到南部喜马拉雅山中的重镇亚东，都可以通行汽车。五条公路干线已经把西藏各大城市和主要的农、牧业区联系起来了。著名的康藏公路和青藏公路，通过了西藏富饶的农牧业区、原始森林区和丰富的矿藏地带，把西藏和祖国内地联系起来。拉（萨）日（喀则）、日（喀则）江（孜）公路贯穿在西藏高原中部，把西藏两个主要经济中心——拉萨和日喀则，以及著名手工业城市江孜连接在一起。
    康藏、青藏公路全线通车后，已经有几万吨物资从祖国各地运来西藏，许多过去无法运来的现代工厂设备、大型农业机械和医疗器材，都已开始在西藏使用。西藏丰富的土产、特产和畜产品，也开始大量运出了。在西藏各条公路干线上，都开办了客运业务，大大便利了各地人民的交往。从西藏东部到西部三千多公里的漫长旅途，因为重重的雪山和大河阻隔，过去需要两年才能往返一次，现在坐汽车只要两个多月的时间就够了。
