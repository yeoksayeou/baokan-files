Vice-Director He was ill. High blood pressure, insomnia.

It was said that Vice-Director He's illness was serious. It couldn't be cured in Guangzhou and he had to go to Shanghai.

Before going to Shanghai, Vice-Director He was surrounded by these people: a communications officer responsible for security and logistics, a full-time secretary responsible for reading newspapers and documents, and a female cook hired with public funds.

Vice-Director He was infatuated with this kind of life with entourages, so before going to Shanghai, he had to do some thinking. Bringing all the followers would be too conspicuous. Not bringing them seemed a bit too lonely.

"Let's do this!" Vice-Director He finally made a decision. Bring an enthusiastic male secretary, plus that not-so-pretty, but still young female cook. However, before this decision could be finalized, Vice-Director He had a sudden whim and thought of his subordinates. It turned out that when he was a section chief, there was a section head in his section named Cao Dingxun, who had the same problem as Vice-Director He: high blood pressure and insomnia.

"Section Chief Cao, how is your health these days?" Vice-Director He asked with concern, and immediately continued, "I'm going to Shanghai for medical treatment. Would you like to go with me?"

"I...I..." Section Chief Cao didn't know how to express his gratitude for a moment, so he just said "I, I" twice, wiped his moist eyes, and didn't say anything else.

Section Chief Cao going to Shanghai for treatment was not in accordance with regulations, just like Vice-Director He shouldn't have brought so many followers. But as soon as Vice-Director He opened his mouth, the enthusiastic secretary had already drafted a report, made a budget, and even got approval from the supervising leader. So, Vice-Director He took the lead, followed by Section Chief Cao, with the enthusiastic male secretary on the left and the not-so-pretty, but still young female cook on the right. This not-so-big, not-so-small medical treatment team arrived in Shanghai on February 8, 1955.

There's one more detail missing. Vice-Director He's brain didn't work well and his memory wasn't strong, so he needed someone to help him read newspapers and documents. But before leaving for Shanghai this time, he didn't forget to have his secretary make a trip in advance. For example, to see if the place to live was quiet and safe, whether the guesthouse chef could cook delicious meals, whether there was a car available for going out, and so on.

The secretary was indeed an enthusiastic person. When he went to Shanghai to prepare the ground, he prepared everything for Vice-Director He and his entourage, and also negotiated with the Shanghai guesthouse: if they stayed for a long time and the rent was too high, the guesthouse would directly report it to the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee for reimbursement; if they didn't stay for long, they would go back to Guangdong for reimbursement. … Everything was ready and arranged properly, and only then did Vice-Director He bring his not-so-big, not-so-small medical treatment team to Shanghai.

After arriving in Shanghai, Vice-Director He stayed in a guesthouse for senior cadres, using three rooms. The guesthouse was fully equipped, and the chef's skills were considered top-notch in the eyes of ordinary people. In this way, the female cook that Vice-Director He brought had no use. But Vice-Director He couldn't bear to send her back empty-handed. He thought for a moment, the female cook's job was to: wash clothes, fetch water... "There are many places where people are needed, right?"

Perhaps the doctor's medical skills were indeed excellent, because within a week of arriving in Shanghai, Section Chief Cao's blood pressure became as normal as a healthy person's. But Vice-Director He couldn't bear to send him back to Guangzhou either. "Now that you're here, stay for a few more days." Vice-Director He said magnanimously. Section Chief Cao certainly understood the leader's intention, saying that he still had some dizziness and headaches that he hadn't been able to cure in Guangzhou for a long time.

Vice-Director He originally wanted to study the Party's "General Line" documents during his medical treatment. But he was treated in the morning and in the afternoon, and sometimes he had to attend banquets, so even the time to "listen" to the documents was "squeezed" out. As for the life and study of the section chief, secretary, and cook, Vice-Director He had even less time to care about.

"What to do?" Because there was no "service" to provide, the enthusiastic secretary, who always had a smiling face, suddenly had a layer of worry on his face. He looked up and saw a girl beside him who was even more bored than he was, so, so... he treated the female cook as his temporary wife....

Vice-Director He stayed in Shanghai for medical treatment from early February to the end of May. He felt some improvement. But the doctors in Shanghai said: "This kind of disease cannot be cured in a short time." And then they immediately prescribed another prescription: travel.

He decided to travel according to the doctor's words. So, Vice-Director He in the lead, followed by Section Chief Cao, with the enthusiastic male secretary on the left, and the not-so-pretty, but still young female cook on the right, they strolled around Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou... When they left Guangzhou, the subtropical magnolia trees had not yet changed their leaves, and when they came back, it was already the summer of blooming flowers.

Vice-Director He is back. What he brought back were reimbursement receipts for more than 1,200 yuan. People calculated for him that this money alone could buy 10,000 catties of millet, enough for 27 ordinary people to eat for a year. This was only the expense reimbursed in Guangdong, and some expenses reimbursed locally had not yet been included.

What needs to be explained here is the situation of Vice-Director He's subordinates. Section Chief Cao was immediately reported – he had never confessed that he participated in the "Military Statistics Bureau" and other counter-revolutionary organizations before liberation. The enthusiastic secretary almost lost his Party membership and was given a disciplinary warning and placed on probation within the Party – because he treated the female cook as his temporary wife. The female cook could no longer serve Vice-Director He and was transferred elsewhere. As for Vice-Director He – he was still the Vice-Director.

What is mentioned above is only one thing that happened during Vice-Director He's medical treatment. In addition, for example: Vice-Director He said that the surrounding environment of the dormitory building he originally lived in was too chaotic, which was not conducive to his high blood pressure, and he had to move to a place used for other people's offices. Well, he was the Vice-Director. As soon as he said he wanted to move, no one dared to say anything, so they had to let him move. When Vice-Director He moved into his new residence, he saw that the roof was not beautiful, and someone had nailed so many nails on the wall, making big and small holes, which was said to have an impact on a person with high blood pressure. So, he opened his mouth: "Call someone to paint it for me!" The appearance of the roof and walls was immediately renewed. Vice-Director He wanted to watch movies, so he first called the agency's film team to his yard, and then to his room for screenings.

Vice-Director He took all of this in stride, calmly and naturally. Because he had some loyal subordinates and a group of colleagues with harmonious relationships. When people reported Vice-Director He's actions to the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Party Group of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee Public Security Department, to which Vice-Director He belonged, slowly wrote a defense. When people pointed out that the female cook's salary of Vice-Director He was paid by the public funds, the person in charge of the Party Group of that agency first denied it outright, and then indirectly said:

"How could that be? The female cook is definitely not within the state establishment. As far as I know, the department did not pay this money. Her salary was paid from the business expenses of a bureau."

    何副厅长养病记
    林里
    何副厅长病了。高血压，失眠。
    据说，何副厅长的病很重。在广州治不好，必须到上海去才行。
    去上海以前，何副厅长身边有这样一些人：一个负责警卫和勤务工作的通讯员，一个负责读报和念文件的专职秘书，还有一个用公家钱雇来的女炊事员。
    何副厅长迷恋于这种前呼后拥的生活，所以在去上海之前，就不能不做一番考虑。把所有随从人员都带上吧，显然太扎眼。不带吧，这些人不在身边，似乎又太有点冷清。
    “这样吧！”何副厅长终于做了决定。带一个热心服务的男秘书，加上那个不太漂亮，但还年轻的女炊事员。然而这个决定还没有形成，何副厅长就一阵心血来潮，想起了他的部下。原来在他做处长的时候，他们那个处里有一位科长，叫曹鼎勋，同何副厅长一样：高血压、失眠。
    “曹科长，这两天身体怎样？”何副厅长关切地问，立刻又接下去说：“我去上海养病，咱们一块去好吗？”
    “我……我……”曹科长一下子不知道怎样表示他的感激，所以只是“我，我”了两声，又擦了擦他那湿润的眼角，就再没有说什么。
    曹科长到上海治病，本来是不合规定的，就像何副厅长不该带那么多随从一样。但是何副厅长的嘴巴刚一张开，那位热心服务的秘书便打好了报告，做了预算，居然还得到了主管首长的批准。于是，何副厅长领先，曹科长随后，热心服务的男秘书在左，不太漂亮、但还年轻的女炊事员在右，这支不大也不小的养病队伍，就在1955年的二月八日到了上海。
    这里还漏了一笔。——何副厅长的脑子不好使，记忆力不强，以致连读报纸、念文件都必须有别人来帮忙。可是这次出发去上海以前，他没有忘了叫他的秘书先跑一趟。比如说，看看住的地方安静不安静，安全不安全，招待所的厨师能不能做可口的饭，出门有没有汽车，以及其他等等。
    秘书确实是个热心服务的人。他在去上海打前站的时候，就给何副厅长及其随从人员准备好了一切，还跟上海的招待所议定：如果住长了，房租太多，就由招待所直接在上海市人民委员会报销；住不长，就回广东报销。……一切就绪，安排妥当之后，何副厅长，这才带了他那支不大也不小的养病队伍到了上海。
    何副厅长到上海后，住的是高级干部招待所，用了三个房间。招待所的设备很齐全，厨师的手艺，在一般人的眼里也还算是上等的。这样一来，何副厅长带来的女炊事员就没有了用武之地。但何副厅长又不忍心叫她空空回去。他转念一想，女炊事员的工作决定了：洗衣服，打开水……，“需要人的地方多着呢？”
    也许是医生的医术确实高明，曹科长到上海后的一星期内，血压就一下变得跟好人一样正常了。但是何副厅长也不忍心叫他回广州。“既然来了，就多呆两天吧。”何副厅长开明地说。曹科长当然能够领会首长的用心，他说他还有些头昏脑热，在广州治了好久也没有治好。
    何副厅长本来想在养病期间，学一学党的“总路线”文件。但他上午治病，下午也治病，有时候还要参加一些宴会，所以连“听”文件的时间也都“挤”掉了。至于科长、秘书和炊事员的生活和学习，何副厅长更是无暇顾及了。
    “干吗呢？”热心服务的秘书因为无“务”可服，一向满面春风的脸上忽然泛起一层愁云。他抬头一看，身边还有一位比他闲得更加无聊的姑娘，于是，于是……他就把女炊事员当做了自己的临时夫人……。
    何副厅长从二月初一直养病养到五月底。他觉得有所好转。可是上海的医生们却说：“这种病一时治不好。”并且随即开了另一付药方：旅行。
    他决定按照医生的话去旅行。于是，何副厅长在先，曹科长随后，热心服务的男秘书在左，不太漂亮、但还年轻的女炊事员在右，他们逛了南京逛无锡，逛了苏州逛杭州……他们离开广州的时候，亚热带的玉兰花树还没有换叶，回来的时候已经是百花盛开的夏天了。
    何副厅长回来了。他带回来的是一千二百多块钱的报销单据。人们替他计算了一下，光是这笔钱就可以买一万斤小米，分给普通人，足够二十七人吃一年。这还只是在广东报账的，另有一些由当地报了账的费用还没有计算在内。
    这里需要交代的是何副厅长手下的那一帮人，那位曹科长立刻受到检举——他在解放前参加“军统”和其他反革命组织的事一直没有交代。热心服务的秘书差一点没有丢了党籍，他受了留党察看的处分——因为他把女炊事员当成了自己的临时夫人。女炊事员再也不能跟何副厅长服务了，随即调到了别地。至于何副厅长——他还是副厅长。
    上面所说的只是何副厅长养病期间的一件事。另外，比方说吧：原来何副厅长住的那幢宿舍，他说周围环境太乱，对他的高血压症不利，必须搬到别人办公用的地方去。副厅长嘛，说声搬，别人也不敢怎么样，就只好让他搬去。何副厅长搬到新居一看，屋顶不漂亮，墙壁上不知谁钉了那么多钉子，弄得大窟隆小眼睛的，据说对一个患高血压症的人也有影响，于是，他把嘴巴一张：“叫人来给我粉刷粉刷！”屋顶墙壁的面貌立刻一新了。何副厅长想看电影，他就把机关的电影队，先是叫到他的院里，继而叫到他的屋里去放映。
    所有这些，何副厅长都处之泰然，安之若素。因为他有几个忠实的部下，还有一群感情融洽的同事。当人们把何副厅长的所作所为，反映给中共广东省委的时候，何副厅长所属的那个机关——广东省人民委员会公安厅的分党组，就不紧不慢地写了一篇辩护词。当人们指出何副厅长的女炊事员的工资是由公家开支的事实后，那个机关的分党组负责人，先是一口否认，后又转湾抹角地说：
    “那哪能呢？女炊事员绝对不在国家编制之内。据我所知，厅里并没有开支这笔钱，她的工资是由一个局的事业费开支的。”
