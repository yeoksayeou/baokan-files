Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    Following the publication of the critical letter "Geological Department and Other Units Damage Capital Construction Planning by Building Houses乱盖房屋" on the "Reader's Letters Page" on October 16, 1955, the Ministry of Geology, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, and the State Construction Commission all sent letters of self-criticism, promising that in the future, all construction would be subject to the approval of urban planning units. The State Construction Commission also proposed that in order to avoid incidents of various units乱盖房屋building houses without planning, design and construction units should pay attention to the issue of auxiliary rooms when designing and building buildings in the future.

    Letter from the Grain Bureau of Xishui County, Hubei Province: February 5th
  The criticism of our bureau's Lanxi Grain Store in the cartoon "Birds' Refuge," published on the "Reader's Letters Page," is correct. This shows that there are serious shortcomings in our grain storage work, and we do not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of carrying out the "eliminate the four pests" movement nationwide. Now, in addition to actively educating the personnel involved about cherishing grain, we have also taken various methods to vigorously catch birds and improve grain storage work.

    Letter from the Organizational Technology Storage and Transportation Department of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation: The suggestion "Strengthening the Popularization of Pharmaceutical Knowledge in the Work of Bringing Over-the-Counter Medicines to the Countryside" on the "Reader's Letters Page" on December 11, 1955, is worth noting. We have notified our affiliated units to strengthen assistance in pharmaceutical business knowledge to the medicine salespersons in department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives that sell medicines in the future, actively carry out the popularization of rural pharmaceutical knowledge, and will further study and improve the packaging instructions of over-the-counter medicines.

    Letter from the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Railways: The criticism of our bureau's indiscriminate issuance of telegrams on the "Reader's Letters Page" on February 19th is correct. In the work of convening the All-Railway Employee Spare-Time Education Conference, because of our insufficient prior consideration, we repeatedly changed the method and time of the conference, and successively sent five telegrams, causing waste to the country and creating a bad influence. In the future, we will definitely pay attention to improving our work and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

    Letter from the Business Office of the Taiyuan Railway Administration: The letter "The Fate of Five Carloads of Ore" published on the "Reader's Letters Page" on February 14th criticized our bureau's train derailment accident. We have already contacted the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and decided to be responsible for compensating them for the losses they suffered as a result of this accident. In addition, we have investigated responsibility, educated the people who made mistakes, and given appropriate punishments.

    Letter from the Maritime Transportation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications: After the letter "Why Did the Democratic No. 7 Wheel Turn Backwards" was published on the "Reader's Letters Page" on January 29th, we have conducted an inspection of this incident. Now, the derelict person Zhang Xianjue has been given a major demerit; the captain and first mate have also made self-criticisms.

    1955年10月16日“读者来信专页”发表了“地质部等单位破坏首都建设规划乱盖房屋”的批评信后，地质部、第二机械工业部和国家建设委员会都来信作了检讨，保证今后进行建筑的时候一定要经过城市规划单位批准。国家建设委员会还提出：为了避免各单位乱盖房屋的事件，希望设计和建筑单位今后在设计和建造建筑物的时候应该注意考虑附属用房的问题。

    湖北省浠水县粮食局来信：二月五日
  “读者来信专页”上发表的漫画“鸟雀的避难所”对我局所属兰溪粮店的批评是正确的。这说明我们在粮食的保管工作上存在着严重的缺点，对于在全国范围内开展消灭“四害”运动的重要意义认识不足。现在，我们除了积极地对有关人员进行爱护粮食的教育外，并且采取了多种多样的方法大力捕捉鸟雀，改进粮食的保管工作。

    铁道部教育局来信：二月十九日“读者来信专页”对我局滥发电报的批评是正确的。我们在召开全路职工业余教育会议的工作中，因为事先考虑不周到，屡次改变会议的方式和时间，连续发出了五封电报，给国家造成了浪费，并且造成了不好的影响。今后，我们一定注意改进工作，保证不再发生类似事情。
