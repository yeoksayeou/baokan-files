    Egyptian People Love Chinese Art
    Féng Zhī Dān
    In the center of Cairo stands a beautiful Romanesque building, surrounded by the green shade of palm trees, with two fountains in front shooting silvery water flowers in the sunlight. This is the Egyptian National Opera House.
    On March 6th, the song and dance artists of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation began performing in this theater.
    The opening ceremony of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation was carried out in an atmosphere of warm friendship. In front of the stage was a huge banner written in both Chinese and Arabic, and under the stage were more than 700 guests invited to attend the opening ceremony, including Egyptian government officials, famous artists, professors, and people from all walks of life in Cairo. In the boxes on both sides sat Egyptian Minister of Education Hussein, who attended the opening ceremony as the representative of Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, as well as Minister of National Guidance Radwan and Minister of Interior Mohieddin. Many foreign envoys to Cairo were also seated in the boxes.
    The program began. First, a small choir stood in front of the stage and sang of Chinese-Egyptian friendship to the Egyptian people. They sang:
    “From the Yangtze River to the banks of the Nile,…………
    China and Egypt, two great ancient countries…………
    Have the best wishes,
    Let us grow happily and healthily.”
    Then, they sang the Egyptian ode "Liberation Song" in Arabic:
    "Arise, Egypt! This beautiful country,
    Advance for glory...,
    Forward! Forward!"
    All the programs, whether they were classical Chinese operas and dances or songs, dances, and music depicting the new life of the Chinese people, were universally praised. People applauded every performance, and some performers took curtain calls four or five times.
    At the end of the opening ceremony, Egyptian Minister of Education Hussein and Minister of National Guidance Radwan stepped onto the stage and shook hands with the leaders and members of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation one by one to express their congratulations.
    From March 7th to 12th, the Chinese Art Troupe performed eight shows, day and night, for the Cairo public. The performance was unprecedentedly grand. In recent days, major Cairo newspapers have published reviews of the performances of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation. The "Egyptian News" wrote on March 8th that the actors of Chinese classical opera and dance "tumbled in mid-air with almost superhuman lightness and agility." The "Republic" wrote on March 9th: "People's China showed Egypt fragments of its ancient life and new life... Moving art saluted Egypt and won the complete admiration and praise of the Egyptian people. We thank the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation for its arrival." The "Al-Ahram" wrote on March 10th, "The art of People's China urges us to develop Egyptian national art." The weekly "Morning News" said: "The performances of the Chinese artists have left an indelible impression on the Egyptian people."
    Egyptian Minister of National Guidance Radwan said when receiving members of the delegation: "I am very happy to tell you that your performances in Cairo have been unanimously praised by the audience, and I have been inspired by them. I am very envious of China's beautiful culture and art. In the past, due to the colonial rule of imperialism, Egyptian national art failed to develop. In the future, we will strive to develop our own national art, and I hope that you will be able to see our achievements in this area when you visit again next time.
    On March 12th, Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, Deputy Prime Minister Salem, along with the Minister of Education, the Minister of Interior, and the Minister of Urban and Rural Affairs, went to the National Opera House to watch the last public performance of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation in Cairo. Before the opening, the head of the delegation, Bao Erhan, thanked Prime Minister Nasser for his presence on the stage, and wished the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people to continue to develop and consolidate, and wished world peace. Prime Minister Nasser sat in the first box on the first floor, constantly responding to the performances of our artists with smiles and applause. During the intermission of the performance, Prime Minister Nasser said to Bao Erhan, the head of the delegation, in the reception room of the opera house: "I very much admire that your art maintains its national style and rich oriental color." He also said: "The visit of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation will help the Chinese and Egyptian people understand each other and further promote the friendship between the two peoples." Finally, he requested the delegation to convey his respect to Premier Zhou Enlai.
    The members of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation spent a pleasant twenty days in Cairo. Wherever the art delegation went in Cairo, it deeply felt the friendly feelings of the Egyptian people towards the Chinese people.
    On the evening of March 13th, at the invitation of the president of Cairo University, our artists performed for 3,000 teachers and students of Cairo University. The audience responded to them with stormy applause. The old president of Cairo University, Kamal Morsi, sat next to me, constantly praising the performances on the stage. He said to me: "We are both oriental countries, and we have many things in common." I will indeed never forget that night, when the performance ended, the students enthusiastically shouted "Long live the friendship between the Egyptian and Chinese people!" "Long live peace!"
    I think it is most appropriate to quote the moving words of Dr. Taha Hussein, an old Egyptian writer and chairman of the Egyptian Writers Association. I met Dr. Taha Hussein at a tea party held by the Egyptian Writers Association to welcome the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation. He said to us:
    "Our two countries are the cradles of ancient civilization. For many centuries, we have had encounters with happiness and disaster. We know how to greet happiness with a smile, and we also know how to bravely fight against evil and disaster. Dear friends, you are meeting your brothers in Egypt, and we are also meeting our brothers in China. The people of our two countries are brothers in happiness and brothers in adversity. Let us unite and strive for our beautiful life. May the friendship and cooperation between the people of our two countries continue to develop."

### 埃及人民热爱中国艺术

    埃及人民热爱中国艺术
    冯之丹
    在开罗的市中心有一座漂亮的罗马式建筑，建筑的四周是棕梠树的绿荫，前面有两个喷泉在阳光下射出银色的水花。这就是埃及国家歌剧院。
    三月六日，中国文化艺术代表团的歌舞艺术家们开始在这个剧院演出。
    中国文化艺术代表团的开幕式是在热烈友谊的气氛中进行的。舞台前面是用中文和阿拉伯文书写的巨幅标语，台下是应邀参加开幕式的七百多位来宾，其中包括埃及政府官员、著名艺术家、教授及开罗各界人士。两旁的包厢上坐着埃及教育部长侯赛尼，他是以埃及总理纳赛尔的代表的身份来出席开幕式的，还有国家指导部长拉德温和内政部长摩海丁。包厢里还坐着许多国家驻开罗的外交使节。
    节目开始了。首先是一个小合唱队站在台前向埃及人民歌唱中埃友谊。他们唱着：
    “从扬子江到尼罗河岸，…………
    中国埃及两个伟大古老的国家…………
    有一个最好的心愿，
    让我们快乐幸福地生长。”
    接着，他们用阿拉伯语唱起埃及的颂歌“解放歌”：
    “起来吧，埃及！这美丽的国家，
    为着光荣而前进……，
    前进！前进！”
    所有的节目，不论是我国的古典歌舞剧或是表现中国人民新生活的歌舞和音乐都受到普遍的赞扬，人们为每一个节目的表演而鼓掌，有的节目的演员谢幕达四、五次。
    开幕式结束时，埃及教育部长侯赛尼和国家指导部长拉德温都步上舞台与中国文化艺术代表团的领导人员及团员们一一握手，表示祝贺。
    三月七日至十二日，中国艺术团为开罗公众演出了日夜八场。演出的盛况是空前的。这些天来，开罗的主要报刊都发表了关于中国文化艺术代表团的演出的评论。三月八日的“埃及新闻”写道：中国古典歌舞剧的演员“几乎以超人的轻快和敏捷在半空中翻腾”。三月九日的“共和国报”写道：“人民中国向埃及表演了它的古代生活及新生活的片断。……动人的艺术向埃及致意，获得了埃及人民的完全的钦佩和赞扬。我们感谢中国文化艺术使团的到来。”三月十日的“金字塔报”写道，“人民中国的艺术促使我们去发展埃及的民族艺术。”周刊“晨报”说：“中国艺术家们的演出给埃及人民留下了不可磨灭的印象。”
    埃及国家指导部长拉德温在接见代表团的人员时说：“我很高兴地告诉你们，你们在开罗的演出得到了观众的一致好评，我也因此而得到了启发。我很羡慕中国优美的文化艺术。过去由于帝国主义的殖民统治，埃及的民族艺术未能得到发展，今后我们将努力发展自己的民族艺术，希望你们下一次再来访问时将能看到我们在这方面的成就。
    三月十二日，埃及总理纳赛尔、副总理萨勒姆偕同教育部长、内政部长和城乡事务部长到国家歌剧院观看中国文化艺术代表团在开罗的最后一次公演。开幕前，代表团团长鲍尔汉在舞台上感谢纳赛尔总理的光临，并祝中埃两国人民的友谊不断发展和巩固，祝世界和平万岁。纳赛尔总理坐在第一层的第一个包厢里，不断用微笑和鼓掌来回答我国艺术家们的表演。在演出的休息时间，纳赛尔总理在歌剧院的会客室里对鲍尔汉团长说：“我非常钦佩你们的艺术保持着自己的民族风格和丰富的东方色彩。”他还说：“中国文化艺术代表团的访问将有助于中埃两国人民的相互了解和进一步促进两国人民之间的友谊。”他最后请求代表团转达他对周恩来总理的敬意。
    中国文化艺术代表团的团员们在开罗度过了愉快的二十天。在开罗，艺术代表团所到之处，深切地感到埃及人民对中国人民的友好的感情。
    三月十三日晚，我国艺术家应开罗大学校长的邀请，为开罗大学三千师生演出。观众以暴风雨般的掌声回答了他们。开罗大学的老校长凯末尔·摩尔西就坐在我的旁边，他不时地称赞舞台上的表演，他对我说：“我们都是东方的国家，我们有着许多共同之处。”我的确不能忘怀那个夜晚，当表演终了时，学生们热情地高呼“埃中两国人民友谊万岁！”“和平万岁！”
    我想，这里引用埃及的老文学家、埃及文学家协会主席塔哈·侯赛尼博士的动人的话是再恰当不过的。我是在埃及文学家协会欢迎中国文化艺术代表团的茶会上见到塔哈·侯赛尼博士的，他向我们说：
  “我们两国都是古代文明的摇篮。在许多世纪里，我们有过幸福和灾难的遭遇。我们知道怎样以微笑迎接幸福，也懂得怎样向邪恶和灾难进行勇敢的斗争。亲爱的朋友们，你们在埃及遇到的是你们的弟兄，我们在中国所遇到的也是我们的弟兄。我们两国人民在幸福中是弟兄，在患难中也是弟兄，让我们团结起来，争取我们美好的生活。愿我们两国人民之间的友好和合作不断地得到发展。”
