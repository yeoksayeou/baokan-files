Hong Kong and Macao Compatriots Love the Motherland
Hu Zi

In the past month or so, more than 150,000 compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao have flocked back to Guangzhou for sightseeing like a tide. In the past, due to various restrictions imposed by the Hong Kong government, most of them had not returned since the liberation of Guangzhou. Among them, some had doubts about the situation in the motherland due to the long-term influence of rumors and propaganda spread by reactionary newspapers in Hong Kong, and some had long held prejudices against socialism. Now, they have come back and seen the facts, and everyone has personally experienced the rapid progress of the motherland, expressing their infinite love for it.

A Hong Kong compatriot who used to be a railway worker before liberation saw more than 1,000 worker activists holding a meeting at the Guangzhou Railway Workers' Cultural Palace. He didn't say anything, but he doubted how there could be so many activists. When he went to the Railway Workers' Hospital and saw the various facilities and the warm care of the doctors and nurses for the workers, he began to say with emotion, "The motherland is indeed considerate to the workers." When he went to the Railway Workers' Nursery and saw a group of chubby children hugging him and calling him uncle in a naive and lively manner, he was so moved that he shed tears on the spot, saying, "No wonder there are more than 1,000 activists in just one railway bureau!" He also plans to send his children back to Guangzhou to study. When leaving Guangzhou, he said: "Hong Kong compatriots who saw the Soviet exhibition a few months ago all said the motherland was good after returning, but I was only half-convinced; this time, I first visited the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Production Exhibition, and I only believed it by 30%; but now, after seeing all aspects, I have given my whole heart to the motherland."

A female worker in her fifties named Zhong Yuyi walked up Yuexiu Mountain and suddenly began to sing loudly, and the people with her laughed at her for being crazy. She said, "I am crazy with joy! It used to be a chaotic graveyard here, but now it has become the beautiful Beixiu Lake."

A group of film directors, actors, and opera performers from Hong Kong went to Guangzhou to watch dramas and visit their relatives and friends in the same profession. They all deeply felt that the status of artists had improved after liberation and that the artistic level had made considerable progress. After attending a gathering, a film actor cried in front of his colleagues with emotion, repeatedly saying, "I was wrong before!"

Among a delegation of elderly businessmen in their sixties and seventies from Macao who came to Guangzhou for sightseeing, many of them originally came back with the intention of seeing what it was like, but after the visit, they have established business relationships with the industrial and commercial circles in Guangzhou, and some have also expressed their intention to invest in the country and send their children back to the motherland for education.

After arriving in Guangzhou, students from Hong Kong and Macao walked and looked around almost non-stop, asking questions about everything they saw and finding everything adorable. A university student met his old classmate and blamed him, saying, "The motherland is so good, why didn't you write to tell me earlier!"

A mechanical engineer working for the Hong Kong government saw that the motherland could now make many things that could not be made before, and that many things that could only be imported before were now exported in large quantities. He told people, "When I return to Hong Kong, I will tell the engineering professionals I know, and let them come back and see for themselves."

The great achievements of the motherland's construction have excited every compatriot from Hong Kong and Macao who has come back to visit. An old industrialist and businessman from Hong Kong summed up his impressions: "Hong Kong and Macao compatriots love the motherland, and the motherland is worthy of the love of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots!"

    港澳同胞热爱祖国
    胡紫
    近一个多月来，香港和澳门的同胞有十五万多人像潮水一样涌回广州参观。过去，由于香港政府的种种限制，他们大多数是在广州解放以后就没有回来过的。他们当中还有一些人因为长期受到香港反动报纸的造谣宣传影响而对祖国的情况有所怀疑，也有一些人长期对社会主义怀有成见。现在，他们回来看到了事实，每个人都从不同的切身体会感受到祖国在飞跃进步，对祖国表示无限的热爱。
    一个曾经在解放前做过铁路工人的香港同胞，在广州铁路工人文化宫看见一千多个工人积极分子在开会，口里没有作声，但是心里却怀疑怎么可能有这么多的积极分子？他再走到铁路工人医院，看到各种设备和医生、护士对工人的亲切照顾，就开始感动地说：“祖国对工人确实体贴”。当他走到铁路工人托儿所，看到一群胖胖的孩子天真活泼地拥着他叫叔叔，当场就感动得流出泪来，说：“难怪一个铁路局就有一千多积极分子！”他还准备把自己的儿女送回广州读书。在离开广州的时候他说：“几个月以前看过苏联展览会的香港同胞，回去以后人人说祖国好，自己只是半信半疑；这次回来，首先参观了广东省农业生产展览会，还只是相信三分；但是现在看了各个方面，整个心都交给祖国了。”
    一个叫钟玉意的五十多岁的女工人，走上越秀山，突然引吭高歌起来，同行的人笑她疯了。她说：“我是高兴得疯了呀！以前这里是乱坟堆，现在变成了大好风景的北秀湖。”
    一群香港的电影导演、演员和戏曲演员，到广州看了戏剧，访问过同行的亲友，他们都深切地感到解放后艺人的地位提高了，艺术水平有了长足的进步。一个电影演员在出席了一次集会以后，感动得当着同行的面前哭起来，连声说“我以前想错了！”
    澳门一群六、七十岁的老商人组成的到广州参观的代表团中，有不少人原来只是怀着看看究竟的心情回来的，但是参观以后，已经和广州的工商界建立了生意关系，有些人还表示要回国投资，把儿女送回祖国教养。
    港澳的学生到广州以后，简直一分钟不停地到处走，到处看，看到什么都问，看见什么都觉得可爱。一个大学的学生遇着旧时的同学，责备他说：“祖国这么好，你为什么不早写信告诉我！”
    一个在香港政府工作的机械工程师，他看见祖国许多以前不能做的东西已经能够做了，许多以前只能靠进口的东西现在已经有大量出口，就告诉人说：“回到香港，我要告诉给我所认识的工程界人士，让他们也回来看看。”
    祖国建设的伟大成就使每一个回来参观过的港澳同胞都感到兴奋。一个香港老工商界人士归结了他的观感：“港澳同胞热爱祖国，祖国值得港澳同胞热爱！”
