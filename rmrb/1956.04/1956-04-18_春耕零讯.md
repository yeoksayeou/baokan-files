    Spring Ploughing News Snippets
    In Zhejiang Province, the vast majority of agricultural producers' cooperatives have completed early rice sowing and have moved on to paddy field management and plowing, preparing for early rice transplanting. Now the paddy fields have all turned green, and the seedlings are growing well. In the suburbs of Wenzhou, the 699 mu of early-sown seedlings have already grown to more than two inches high. In order to cultivate strong seedlings, many agricultural producers' cooperatives have established paddy field management measures such as irrigation, drainage, frost protection, warmth preservation, fertilization, and pest control.
    In order to enable farmers to master the techniques of double-season early rice paddy field management, plowing, and transplanting, the agricultural departments of Zhejiang Province have hired more than 5,000 farmers with experience in planting and cultivating double-season rice to go to the new planting areas to impart farming techniques.
    The early rice sowing work in Jiangxi Province has all ended. Seedling growth is better than in any previous year, and is now generally about two inches high. Transplanting has already begun in southern Jiangxi, where the season is early.
    In the vast rural areas of Shandong Province, spring sowing has begun from south to north. More than 90% of the province's spring land has undergone winter plowing, and the number of spring harrows this year is also greater than in previous years, generally five or six times, and sometimes more than ten times. The planting area of improved varieties has greatly expanded this year. In the Tai'an area, the planting area of improved varieties has expanded to more than 75% this year, of which the planting area of improved corn and sweet potato varieties has reached 80% to 90%. This area is expected to increase grain production by more than 200 million jin from improved varieties alone. There is also a sufficient amount of base fertilizer for spring land this year. For example, in the Heze area, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of spring land this year is more than 4,500 jin, more than double that of last year. Attention was also paid to technical guidance such as dense planting and pesticide seed dressing during spring sowing.

    春耕零讯
    浙江省绝大部分农业生产合作社已经完成了早稻播种，转入秧田管理和翻耕水田，为早稻插秧作准备。现在秧田已经全部转青，秧苗生长良好。温州市郊区早播的699亩秧苗已经长出二寸多高。各地为了培育壮秧，不少的农业生产合作社订出了秧田灌水、排水、防冻、保暖、施肥和治螟虫等秧田管理措施。
    为了使农民掌握双季早稻秧田管理、耕田和插秧技术，浙江省农业部门聘请了五千多名有种植、栽培双季稻经验的农民到新种植区去传授耕作技术。
    江西省各地早稻播种工作全部结束。秧苗生长比过去任何一年都好，目前一般已经长至二寸左右高，季节早的赣南已经开始插秧。
    山东省的广大农村里，春季播种由南到北开始了。全省的春地，有90％以上进行了冬耕，今年春耙遍数比往年也多，一般耙到五、六遍，有的十多遍。优良品种播种面积今年大大扩大了。泰安专区今年良种播种面积扩大到75％以上，其中玉米、甘薯良种种植面积达80％到90％，这个专区预计仅良种一项即可增产粮食二亿多斤。今年春地底肥也较为充足，如菏泽专区今年平均每亩春地施肥四千五百多斤，比去年增加一倍多。在春播中还注意了密植、农药拌种等技术指导。
