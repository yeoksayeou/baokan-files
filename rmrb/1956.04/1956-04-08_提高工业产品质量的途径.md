In recent years, although the quality of industrial products in Shenyang has improved, the situation of poor product quality is still serious. According to a survey of thirty-five factories, twenty-one factories did not complete their main product quality indicators for 1955. In many machinery processing plants, the forgings, castings, and machined parts do not meet geometric tolerances; some products have poor mechanical structures and unreliable electrical controls; and some products have high return rates. The Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory's returned switches from inventory accounted for 40%, and returned products from sales reached about 50%. This factory had to send people all over the country to repair switches for users. Some products of the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory were rusty before they even left the warehouse. 17% of the plate glass from the Shenyang Glass Factory was moldy and deteriorated. The raincoats from the Fourth Rubber Factory were sticky and leaked, and the wettable 666 pesticide from the Shenyang Pesticide Factory could not kill insects. Poor product quality has caused serious losses to the country. According to incomplete statistics from factories in the machinery, heavy industry, and light industry systems of Shenyang, in 1955, the country lost more than five million yuan due to many defective products and low-quality products being sold at reduced prices. This money could have bought 462 1A62 lathes or 52,849 double-wheel double-furrow plows. Poor product quality often delays the work of users, many of whom are key national construction units.

Since the beginning of this year, after implementing the central government's instructions of "more, faster, better, and more economical," the product quality of many factories in Shenyang has greatly improved. The number of factories whose plan completion was directly affected by poor product quality has been greatly reduced. Some factories with poor product quality last year have also improved in January and February this year. For example, the oil circuit breakers produced by the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory had an average return rate of about 50% from January to August last year. In February this year, the return rate of oil circuit breakers dropped to 18%. The Shenyang General Machinery Factory's average scrap rate for cast steel in the first quarter of last year reached 33%; the average scrap rate for cast iron reached 28%; and the processing scrap rate reached 8.8%. In January this year, the scrap rate for cast steel decreased to 6.9%; the scrap rate for cast iron decreased to 6.83%; and the processing scrap rate decreased to 2.1%. From January to September last year, among the twenty factories that did not complete their plans, ten were affected by poor quality, high scrap rates, and high return rates; in February this year, among the eleven factories that did not complete their plans, only one factory was affected by quality problems.

However, this does not mean that there are no more problems with the quality of industrial products in Shenyang. No, the problem of low product quality has not been completely solved, and the phenomenon of unqualified product quality, failure to meet finished product rate targets, and high scrap and return rates still exists seriously. The return rate of the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory in January and February was still above 20%, exceeding the control target by ten times, and the quality of some products still cannot be guaranteed after they leave the factory. The switches supplied by this factory to Anshan Iron and Steel were of poor performance, and ten motors were burned out in fifty days, resulting in great losses. The scrap rate of the Shenyang Glass Factory in January was 11.79%, but in February, it not only did not decrease but increased to 19.39%, exceeding the planned target by one time. In February, the first-class product plan for worsted woolen fabrics from the Shenyang Woolen Mill was 94%, but it actually only reached 65.9%. Therefore, the product quality problem is still the most serious problem at present.

In order to improve product quality, we must first establish the idea of guaranteeing quality and oppose complacency and right-leaning conservatism on quality issues. For example, some people think that "given the conditions of our factory, the product quality is already good," or that "our products are rare in the country, and even if the quality is a bit poor, they have to be used," so they do not actively try to improve product quality. Some factories also emphasize objective difficulties, complain that the requirements are too high, and even arbitrarily modify quality indicators. Some even knowingly order substandard products to be put into storage in order to complete the task at the end of the month. Without struggling against this tendency to ignore product quality and without a minimum of seriousness in dealing with quality issues, it is obviously impossible to improve product quality. Education on guaranteeing and improving product quality should be carried out among the broad masses of workers, and the socialist enthusiasm of the masses should be guided towards quality, mobilizing the masses to put forward rationalization proposals for guaranteeing and improving product quality, and promoting advanced experiences in guaranteeing and improving product quality.

Second, strengthen technical management. The weak foundation and chaotic work of technical management is an important reason for poor product quality. At present, the technical management work of many factories cannot meet the requirements of production development. The design, technology, and metallurgy work of some factories are all handled by a comprehensive technical section, which is actually too much to handle. Although the technical management organizations of some factories are relatively sound, the system is not perfect, drawings are full of errors, and the process equipment is either incomplete or does not meet specifications. There are even many factories without formal process regulations, instrument equipment loses accuracy, and inspection and measurement work is very unsound. This chaotic phenomenon in technical work must end. To this end, it is necessary to improve technical management organizations and technical management systems, ensure the correctness of drawing design, strengthen the production of process equipment, formulate complete process regulations, improve physical and chemical testing work, strengthen technical supervision, clarify quality inspection standards, and strictly enforce quality inspection systems.

Third, strive to improve the technical and cultural level of the broad masses of workers. This is the fundamental way to guarantee and improve product quality. In recent years, most of the state-owned factories in Shenyang have undergone technological transformation, and a large number of new technical equipment has been added, and new products have also been continuously increasing, but the growth of technical strength has not kept up with the needs. Not only are engineering and technical personnel still very scarce, but there is also a shortage of skilled workers, and the types of work are very incomplete; among the existing skilled workers, there are few senior workers and many junior workers. According to statistics from sixty-two factories, workers below the fourth grade account for 70%. Due to the low technical level, new equipment cannot be fully mastered, and new equipment that can be barely operated cannot fully utilize machine efficiency, accidents occur frequently, and quality cannot be fully guaranteed. At present, the broad masses of workers have a high enthusiasm for learning technology and culture, and this requirement of the masses should be fully met. Through summarizing and promoting advanced experience, signing contracts for teaching and learning, organizing technical research associations, running technical training classes, technical knowledge lectures, and formal cultural and technical spare-time schools, and other diverse methods, the technical and cultural level of workers should be improved.

Fourth, engineering and technical personnel are the technical guiding force of enterprises, and it is necessary to conscientiously implement the central government's instructions on strengthening the work of intellectuals and give full play to the role of engineering and technical personnel. At present, the socialist enthusiasm of engineering and technical personnel is unprecedentedly high, and technical research and technical guidance work have also been improved, but not enough attention has been paid to the issue of guaranteeing product quality from a technical point of view. Therefore, all engineering and technical personnel should strengthen technical research work, strive to learn advanced Soviet science and technology, and attach great importance to the advanced production experience created by the workers, especially the advanced experience in improving product quality. Some factories in Shenyang have done this: they have carefully studied the rationalization proposals put forward by workers, and actively organized the realization of the rationalization proposals of workers, and timely summarized advanced production experience to enrich technical guidance work. Facts have proved that this is completely correct, and wherever this has been done, not only has labor productivity been improved, but also product quality has been guaranteed.

    提高工业产品质量的途径
    申之澜
    几年来沈阳市工业产品的质量虽然有所提高，但是产品质量不好的情况依然是严重的。据对三十五个工厂的调查，有二十一个工厂没有完成1955年主要产品的质量指标。许多机械加工厂的锻铸件、机械加工件不符合几何形状公差；有些产品的机械结构不好，电气控制不灵；有些产品返修率很高。沈阳低压开关厂的入库开关返修品占40％，售出产品返修达50％左右。这个工厂不得不派人跑遍全国，为用户修理开关。沈阳空气压缩机厂有些产品还没出库就生锈。沈阳玻璃厂的平板玻璃有17％发霉变质。第四橡胶厂的雨衣发粘、漏雨，沈阳农药厂的可湿性六六六杀不死虫子。由于产品质量不好，给国家造成严重的损失。据沈阳市机械、重工、轻工等五个产业系统工厂的不完全统计，1955年由于废品多、质量低劣被迫降价出售，就使国家损失了五百多万元，这些钱可买1A62车床462台，双轮双铧犁52，849台。由于产品质量不好，常常耽误用户的工作，而这些用户有很多都是国家的重点建设单位。
    今年以来，在贯彻执行中央“又多、又快、又好、又省”的指示后，沈阳市不少工厂的产品质量大有改进，由于产品质量不好直接影响计划完成的工厂大大减少了。去年产品质量不好的一些工厂，今年一、二月份也有改进。如沈阳高压开关厂出产的油断路器，去年一月至八月返修率平均为50％左右，今年二月份油断路器的返修率降为18％。沈阳通用机械厂去年第一季度铸钢废品率平均达33％；铸铁废品率平均达28％；加工废品率达8.8％。今年一月份，铸钢废品率降低为6.9％；铸铁废品率降低为6.83％；加工废品率降低为2.1％。去年一到九月份，二十个没有完成计划的工厂中，因为质量不好，废品和返修品多而影响完成计划的就有十个；今年二月份十一个没有完成计划的工厂中，因为质量问题而影响完成计划的只有一个工厂。
    但是，这并不是说沈阳市工业产品的质量已经没有问题了。不，产品质量低劣的问题并没有完全解决，产品质量不合格，达不到成品率指标，废品和返修品多的现象依然严重地存在。沈阳低压开关厂一、二月份的返修率还在20％以上，超过控制指标十倍，而且有的产品出厂后仍不能保证质量。这个厂供给鞍钢用的开关，由于性能不好，五十天中就烧坏了十台电动机，损失很大。沈阳玻璃厂一月份的废品率有11.79％，而二月份不但没降低，反而增加到19.39％ ，超过计划指标一倍。沈阳毛织厂二月份的精纺毛织品，一级品计划为94％，实际只达到65.9％。因此，产品质量问题仍然是目前最严重的问题。
    为了提高产品质量，首先要树立保证质量的思想，反对在质量问题上的自满情绪和右倾保守思想。例如有的认为“按照我们工厂的条件说来，产品质量已经不错了”，或者认为“我们的产品是全国稀有的，就是质量差一点也得用它”，于是就不积极设法去提高产品质量。还有的工厂强调客观困难，埋怨要求太高，竟擅自修改质量指标，甚至有的明明知道产品质量不合格，为了月末完成任务而命令入库。不同这种忽视产品质量的倾向作斗争，没有最起码的对待质量问题的严肃态度，要想提高产品质量显然是不可能的。在广大职工中应该进行保证和提高产品质量的教育，把群众的社会主义积极性引导到质量方面来，发动群众提出保证和提高产品质量的合理化建议，推广保证和提高产品质量的先进经验。
    第二、加强技术管理工作。技术管理的基础薄弱、工作混乱，是造成产品质量低劣的一个重要原因。目前许多工厂的技术管理工作不能适应生产发展的要求，有些工厂的设计、工艺、冶金等技术工作都由一个综合性的技术科包揽，实际上顾不过来。有些工厂的技术管理机构虽然比较健全，但是制度不完善，图纸错误百出，工艺装备不是不完备就是不合规格。甚至还有许多工厂没有正规的工艺规程，仪器设备失去精度，检查和计量工作很不健全。这种技术工作中的混乱现象必须结束。为此，必须健全技术管理机构和技术管理制度，保证图纸设计正确，加强工艺装备生产，制定完善的工艺规程，改善理化试验工作，加强技术监督，明确质量检查标准，严格质量检查制度。
    第三、努力提高广大职工的技术水平和文化水平。这是保证和提高产品质量的根本办法。几年来，沈阳市的国营工厂大都经过技术改造，新的技术设备大量增加，新的产品也不断的增多，但是技术力量的增长却赶不上需要。不仅工程技术人员还很缺乏，就是技术工人也很不足，工种很不齐；现有技工中也是高级工少，低级工多。据六十二个工厂统计，四级以下的工人就占70％。由于技术水平低，不能完全掌握新的设备，已经勉强能够操纵的新设备也不能充分发挥机器效能，经常出事故，不能完全保证质量。目前广大职工群众要求学习技术、学习文化的热情很高，应该充分满足群众的这种要求，通过总结和推广先进经验、签订包教保学合同、组织技术研究会、开办技术训练班、技术知识讲座和正规文化技术业余学校等多种多样的方法，来提高职工的技术文化水平。
    第四、工程技术人员是企业的技术指导力量，需要认真贯彻执行中央关于加强知识分子工作的指示，充分发挥工程技术人员的作用。目前，工程技术人员的社会主义积极性空前高涨，技术研究和技术指导工作也有所改进，但是从技术上来保证产品质量的问题还注意不够。因此，所有的工程技术人员，都应该加强技术研究工作，努力学习苏联的先进科学技术，十分重视工人群众所创造的先进生产经验，特别是提高产品质量的先进经验。沈阳市有若干工厂的工程技术人员这样做了，他们认真研究职工提出的合理化建议，并且积极组织实现职工的合理化建议，及时总结先进生产经验，来丰富技术指导工作。事实证明这样做是完全正确的，凡是这样做了的地方，不但提高了劳动生产率，而且保证了产品质量。
