Please allow me, on behalf of the Japanese Association of Democratic Scientists, a member organization of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, to sincerely congratulate the World Federation of Scientific Workers on its tenth anniversary. As an Asian member of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, our association attaches particular importance to this tenth-anniversary commemoration held in Beijing, China. Japan and China are so close, only a three-hour flight away; if there were normal diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Japan, and if Japanese scientists had ample financial resources, I think many members of our association would have come to participate in this commemoration. All my colleagues unanimously and sincerely congratulate the World Federation of Scientific Workers on its tenth anniversary, and highly appreciate its past achievements and are full of confidence in its future.

Our association has only been formally a member of the World Federation of Scientific Workers for over a year. We have not fully fulfilled our responsibilities as a member, but this cannot be excused by our late participation. Our association decided to join the World Federation of Scientific Workers because it is an organization under whose guidance scientists can seriously consider the issue of their social responsibility.

Please allow me to tell you that we Japanese scientists should understand our social responsibility more than scientists in any other country. This is because: First, the majority of Japanese scientists once intentionally or unintentionally supported Japan's war of aggression. Second, Japan is currently in a semi-colonial position. There are more than seven hundred military bases in Japan. The frequent takeoffs and landings of jet aircraft have made it impossible for some universities to conduct teaching and research work. Research funding for pursuing scientific truth is also decreasing due to rearmament. Third, on the small land of Japan, it has been twice devastated by atomic bombs and threatened by hydrogen bomb tests. The U.S. government is currently continuing nuclear weapons testing on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific. Japanese scientists are very aware of the series of disasters brought about by these inhuman weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, as scientific workers, they have a responsibility to fight for the prohibition of atomic and nuclear weapons. I believe that, in order to protect the safety of human life, it is not excessive to make the disasters Japan has suffered known to the world.

The incident in which many crew members of the "Fifth Fukuryu Maru" suffered disaster due to the U.S. government's hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll in March 1954 has shocked the people of the world.

We Japanese scientists have personally witnessed the rainwater, fish, plants, livestock, and seawater contaminated by the Bikini atomic dust. We have conducted scientific investigations of these affected objects, and the results clearly show that if nuclear weapons testing continues, humanity will inevitably embark on a path of self-destruction. We must seriously discuss and study this major issue – this is the conclusion our association reached after extensive consideration. Therefore, close cooperation is absolutely necessary, not only among scientific workers in Japan but also among all conscientious scientific workers around the world. Just then, Professor Joliot-Curie, the chairman of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, informed us in a letter that the World Federation of Scientific Workers might accept the Japanese Association of Democratic Scientists as its member at the Executive Council meeting in September 1954. I firmly believe that by participating in the World Federation of Scientific Workers, our activities will gain more effective development; because to deal with the policy of "seeking peace through strength," we must rely on the close cooperation of conscientious scientists from all countries around the world. We firmly believe that strengthening the organization of scientific workers who serve human happiness rather than using science for war purposes will clear the way for the work of stopping war. The establishment of the World Federation of Scientific Workers is precisely for this purpose.

The charter of the World Federation of Scientific Workers states: "We oppose directing the efforts of scientific work towards the path of war preparation, and we more firmly oppose forcing science to provide means of mass destruction." The innermost desire of all scientific workers is to devote themselves wholeheartedly to their research work. The worse the working conditions, the stronger this desire becomes. The most embarrassing thing is that scientific workers have to sell their honor in order to improve their working conditions. We Japanese scientific workers have experienced this in the past, and today, I must say with regret, this sinful tendency still exists. Our association, in accordance with the spirit stipulated in the aforementioned charter of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, has resolutely carried out the struggle against arms expansion and war preparation; however, we have not encountered many difficulties in the struggle. Although the Japanese constitution stipulates opposition to war, American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries who depend on it are trying to make science serve the purpose of arms expansion and war preparation. In order to effectively stop arms expansion and war preparation, an united front of all scientific workers is absolutely indispensable. So, what is the policy of this united front? Because the alliance of scientific workers must be built on a correct policy. This alliance cannot be merely for the personal interests of scientific workers; especially in Japan, where the history of scientific development is very short, the goal of this organization is obviously much greater than this. We have carefully studied the issue of the social responsibility of scientific workers contained in the charter of the World Federation of Scientific Workers; based on this principle, we will make unremitting efforts to strive for a broader alliance of scientific workers. In this regard, the World Federation of Scientific Workers has given us great encouragement and help, and I would like to express our deep gratitude here.

Before I conclude my speech, I would like to talk about one more thing, that is, the U.S. government, regardless of the condemnation of world public opinion, brazenly continues to conduct hydrogen bomb tests on Eniwetok Atoll. As everyone knows, even the Japanese Diet has called loudly against conducting hydrogen bomb tests. However, the note from the U.S. government claimed: "Stopping further tests is fundamentally out of the question. All means have been taken to prevent casualties. Compensation is guaranteed for casualties." This is a statement that completely despises science and humanity. These words have been spoken, but how exactly do they intend to deal with the radioactive materials produced by the explosion? In the eyes of us biologists, the significant impact of radioactive materials on humans in terms of heredity is a problem that cannot be ignored. We must spare no effort to fight to protect the survival of humanity and the happiness of our descendants. Professor Muller, an American authority on genetics, warned that if X-rays are used carelessly during diagnosis, it will seriously affect the patient's offspring. My views on genetics do not agree with Professor Muller's, but I agree with his warning. As a scientist, I would like to express my respect for his conscience.

We Japanese scientists believe that it is necessary to organize an organization of scientific workers built on a broader foundation to engage in the collection of scientific intelligence on the destructive nature of nuclear weapons. We firmly believe that it is possible for scientific workers to form such an organization under the guidance of this noble idea of society. In order to promote the smooth convening of the "International Scientific Conference" initiated by the World Federation of Scientific Workers, our Japanese Association of Democratic Scientists fully understands the responsibilities that we should fulfill as a member of the World Federation of Scientific Workers. Finally, I wish the World Federation of Scientific Workers a smooth development.

    日本柘植秀臣教授的发言
    请允许我代表世界科学工作者协会的会员团体——日本民主主义科学者协会，衷心地祝贺世界科协十周年纪念。作为世界科协的亚洲成员之一，我们的协会特别重视这次在中国北京举行的十周年纪念会。日本和中国距离得这样近，只有三小时航程；如果中华人民共和国同日本之间有着正常的外交关系，如果日本的科学家有宽裕的经济条件，我想我们协会的许多会员都会前来参加这次纪念会的。我所有的同仁们都一致衷心地祝贺这次世界科协十周年纪念会，并且对它过去的成就给予很高的评价，对它的前途满怀着信心。
    我们的协会自从正式加入世界科学工作者协会以来，只不过一年多。我们并没有充分尽到我们作为一个会员所应尽的责任，但这并不能用我们参加得晚来作为借口。我们的协会之所以决定参加世界科协，那是因为它是这样的一个组织——在它的指导之下，科学工作者们能认真地来考虑他们的社会责任的问题。
    请允许我告诉诸位：我们日本的科学家应该比任何其他国家的科学家更了解到自己的社会责任。这是因为：首先，多数的日本科学家曾经有意或无意地支持过日本的侵略战争。其次，日本目前正处于半殖民地的地位。在日本一共有七百多个军事基地。由于喷气式飞机的频繁起飞和着陆，吵得有些大学已无法进行教课和研究工作。而关于追寻科学真理的研究经费，也由于重新武装而日益减少。第三，在小小的日本土地上，曾经两次遭受到原子弹的蹂躏，并曾受到氢弹试验的威胁。而美国政府目前还在太平洋的恩纳威托克岛继续进行核子武器的试验。日本科学家很清楚地认识到这些惨无人道的大规模毁灭性武器所带来的一连串的灾难。因此，作为科学工作者，他们有责任为争取禁止原子武器和核子武器而斗争。我相信，为了保卫人类生命的安全，把日本所遭受到的灾难公诸全世界是并不过分的。
    由于美国政府1954年3月在比基尼岛进行氢弹试验，使“福龙丸第五号”许多船员遭受到灾害，这件事已经使全世界人民为之震惊。
    我们日本的科学家，曾亲眼看到遭受比基尼原子灰尘袭染的雨水、鱼类、植物、牲畜和海水。我们对这些受害物进行了科学调查，结果很清楚地说明：如果核子武器的试验再继续下去，人类势将走上自取毁灭的道路。我们必须认真讨论和研究这一重大问题——这就是我们的协会在经过多方面考虑后所得到的结论。因此，不仅是在日本的科学工作者之间，而且是在全世界所有有良心的科学工作者之间，密切合作是绝对必要的。正好那时世界科协主席约里奥—居里教授在给我的一封信中通知我们：世界科协可能在1954年9月的执行理事会上接受日本民主主义科学工作者协会为它的会员。我深信，由于参加了世界科协，我们的活动将获得更为有效的发展；因为要对付“以实力谋取和平”的政策，就必须依靠全世界各国有良心的科学家的紧密合作。我们深信，增强了将科学服务于人类幸福而非用于战争目的的科学工作者的组织，就会为制止战争的工作扫清道路。世界科协的成立正是为了这个目的。
    在世界科协的宪章上有这样一段话：“我们反对把科学工作的努力引向备战的道路，我们更坚决反对强使科学来提供大规模毁灭的手段”。所有科学工作者的内心愿望，是全心全力地来从事自己的研究工作。工作条件愈差，这种愿望愈加强烈。最令人难堪的是，科学工作者为了改善工作条件，甚至要出卖他们的荣誉。这些我们日本的科学工作者过去曾经历过的，而今天，我要不胜遗憾地说，这种罪恶的倾向依然存在。我们的协会曾遵照前面所谈到的世界科协宪章规定的精神，坚决进行了反对扩军备战的斗争；然而，我们在斗争中并不是没有遭到许多困难的。尽管日本宪法上规定反对战争，然而美帝国主义以及依附于它的日本反动派却正在力图使科学服务于扩军备战的目的。为了有效地制止扩军备战，绝对不可缺少的就是所有科学工作者的统一战线。那么，这个统一战线的方针是什么呢？因为科学工作者的联盟必须建立在一个正确的方针上。这个联盟决不能仅仅是为了科学工作者个人的利益；尤其是在科学发展的历史很短的日本，这个组织的目标显而易见是要比这远大得多。我们曾认真地研究了世界科协宪章中所载的关于科学工作者的社会责任的问题；根据这一原则，我们将为争取科学工作者更广泛的联盟而进行不懈的努力。在这方面，世界科协曾给了我们很大的鼓励和帮助，我谨在这里表示我们的深切的谢意。
    在我的发言结束之前，我要再谈一件事，那就是美国政府不顾全世界舆论的谴责，悍然在恩纳威托克岛继续进行氢弹试验。大家知道，甚至日本国会也大声疾呼反对进行氢弹试验。可是美国政府的照会却声称：“停止继续试验是根本不能考虑的。业经采取了一切手段来防止伤亡。对伤亡事件保证给予赔偿。”这是个完全蔑视科学和人道的声明。这些话是说出来了，可是究竟他们打算如何来处理爆炸所产生的放射性物质呢？在我们生物学家的眼中看来，放射性物质在遗传方面对人类的重大影响，是一个不容轻视的问题。我们必须不遗余力地进行斗争，保护人类的生存和我们的后代子孙的幸福。美国的遗传学权威穆勒教授曾警告说：用爱克斯光进行诊断时，倘使运用得不小心，将会严重影响到病人的后代。我在遗传学上的看法同穆勒教授并不一致，可是我同意他的警告。作为一个科学家，我谨对他的良心表示敬意。
    我们日本科学家认为，必须组织一个建立在更广泛基础上的科学工作者的组织，从事于搜集有关核子武器的破坏性方面的科学情报。我们深信，科学工作者在社会这一崇高思想的指导之下，来组成这样一个组织是可能的。为了促使世界科协所发起的“国际科学会议”能顺利召开，我们日本民主主义科学者协会充分了解到自己作为世界科协的一个会员团体应尽的责任。最后，我谨祝世界科协的顺利发展。
