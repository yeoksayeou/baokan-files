    Fujian farmers are planting a large number of subtropical crops such as castor beans, sisal hemp, and kapok on newly reclaimed wasteland and mountain land. In the Haicang district of Haicheng County, over 2,000 mu of newly reclaimed wasteland are being planted with sisal hemp. Jinjiang, Longxi, and other places have also begun sowing castor bean seeds. The harvest of castor beans alone will increase farmers' income by about one million yuan.
    The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to select 1,500 party member cadres from among county and district-level cadres and existing work team cadres who have a proper work style, can connect with the masses, have some rural work experience, and are roughly equivalent to district committee members, to recommend them to agricultural cooperatives with more than 300 people to serve as vice-chairmen. This group of cadres will be dispatched by the end of April, and will undergo rigorous training before being assigned.
    The Xiangzhi Township Fisheries Production Cooperative in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, overcame the largest typhoon in forty years in March, increasing its fish catch by 25% compared to the same period last year. Currently, members are launching a cooperative-wide labor emulation campaign to welcome the peak spring fishing season.
