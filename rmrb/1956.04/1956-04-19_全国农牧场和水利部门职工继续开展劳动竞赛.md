Xinhua News Agency reports:
    To accelerate and exceed the targets of the First Five-Year Plan, a socialist emulation is underway across more than 650 state-owned mechanized farms, pastures, agricultural machine and tractor stations, and water conservancy construction units nationwide.
    This emulation was initiated in January by twenty state-owned farms and pastures, such as the State-owned Friendship Farm and the Red Prairie Pasture, and four agricultural machinery stations, including Beijing and Huachuan, as well as the Yellow River Planning Commission's "May Fourth" Youth Drilling Team. Simultaneously, farms, pastures, and agricultural machinery stations in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Henan, Jiangxi, and other provinces have also launched emulations among themselves and within their respective trades.
    Since the start of the emulation, many farms and pastures have conducted research based on their specific circumstances, tapped into production potential, and revised their production plans. For example, the State-owned Fengxian Farm increased its cotton production plan from the initial 150 jin (seed cotton) per mu to 300 jin per mu, doubling the actual output of the previous year. The Red Prairie Pasture in Heilongjiang originally planned for each dairy cow to produce 3,000 kilograms of milk this year, but after mass discussions, this was raised to 3,600 kilograms, with some even aiming to reach over 5,000 kilograms.

    全国农牧场和水利部门职工继续开展劳动竞赛
    为提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的社会主义竞赛，正在全国六百五十多个国营机械农场、牧场、农业机器拖拉机站和水利建设施工单位展开。
    这个竞赛是今年一月由国营友谊农场、红色草原牧场等二十个国营农场、牧场和北京、桦川等四个农业机器站以及黄河规划委员会“五四”青年钻机组等倡议后发展起来的。同时，黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、河北、河南、江西等省的农场、牧场、农业机器站之间和同工种之间都展开了竞赛。
    竞赛开展以后，许多农场和牧场都根据本单位的情况，进行了研究，挖掘了生产潜力，修订了生产计划。如国营奉贤农场的棉花生产计划由开始的每亩一百五十斤（籽棉）增加到每亩三百斤，比去年的实际产量提高了一倍半。黑龙江红色草原牧场原计划今年每头奶牛的产奶量三千公斤，在群众讨论后又提高到三千六百公斤，部分的还要求达到五千多公斤。
