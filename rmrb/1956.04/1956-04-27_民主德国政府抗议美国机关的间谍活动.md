Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 26th. The government of the German Democratic Republic has protested to the US military authorities regarding the digging of underground tunnels and the installation of telephone tapping stations by US agencies within the democratic sector of Berlin. The protest pointed out that these activities by US agencies are among the measures taken by the US authorities to make West Berlin a base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These measures are a violation of international law and are creating obstacles on the road to easing international tensions and understanding.

    The East German government also pointed out that, for the sake of understanding between Germans, it is necessary for the West Berlin municipal authorities to stop all espionage activities originating from West Berlin that are aimed at sabotaging East Germany.

    These espionage activities by the US military authorities in West Berlin have aroused great indignation from all sectors of East German society. On the evening of April 24th, at a rally of working people held in Berlin, a protest was unanimously adopted, demanding that all such espionage and other sabotage organizations be stopped.

    民主德国政府抗议美国机关的间谍活动
    新华社柏林26日电  德意志民主共和国政府就美国机关在柏林民主区境内挖掘地下坑道、设置电话偷听站向美国军事当局提出抗议。抗议里指出：美国机关的这种活动是美国当局使西柏林成为北大西洋集团的基地的措施之一。这种措施是对国际法的破坏，并且是在国际局势缓和和谅解的道路上设置障碍。
    民主德国政府同时指出：为了德国人之间的谅解，西柏林市政当局有必要制止一切从西柏林发出的对民主德国进行破坏的间谍活动。
    西柏林美国军事当局的这种间谍活动，激起了民主德国社会各界的极大愤慨。四月二十四日晚，在柏林举行的劳动人民的集会上，一致通过了一个抗议书，要求制止一切这种间谍和其它破坏组织的活动。
