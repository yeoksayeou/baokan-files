Building the Interior
    Supporting Petroleum Exploration in the Interior
    Recently, six geophysical exploration teams, three geological teams, two drilling teams, and a group of technicians from the Yumen Oil Mine have successively departed for the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and other places to support petroleum exploration.
    To vigorously support the petroleum industry construction of fraternal units with technical strength, the Yumen Oil Mine has already transferred four drilling teams, one well testing team, and nearly 300 engineers, technicians, and technical management cadres of various trades, including seismic, gravimetric, geological, drilling, electrical logging, well testing, and mechanical, in the first quarter of this year to support petroleum exploration in the Qaidam Basin, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and the construction project of the Lanzhou Refinery.

    Baotou Adds a New Surge of Electricity
    On the 10th, the Baotou Power Plant transmitted a new surge of electricity to various basic construction sites throughout the city. A new generator in this plant, originally scheduled to be put into production on May 1st, generated electricity ahead of schedule.
    This year, Baotou City will build and expand many factories serving the construction of the iron and steel complex, and the workload of basic construction has increased by 224% compared with last year. To support the electricity needs of these basic construction projects, the Baotou Power Plant began expanding two new generators in May last year. Currently, another generator is being installed.

    Two Large Silkworm Seed Farms to Be Built in Southern Xinjiang
    Two of the largest silkworm seed farms in the Northwest region are being built in Moyu and Shache counties in southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where mulberry trees are densely planted. The Moyu Silkworm Seed Farm covers an area of 1,000 mu, and the Shache Silkworm Seed Farm covers an area of 800 mu. The two farms will jointly breed 90,000 boxes of silkworm eggs.
    While building the silkworm houses, the two farms have also planted more than 700 mu of new mulberry seedlings. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Building a Hydropower Plant in Lhasa
    The Tibet Power Station Engineering Team of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry has begun its work. In the past few days, they have surveyed the geological conditions of the Lhasa Hydropower Plant and the central route of the canal. They are now further conducting supplementary surveys and drilling for the geological and hydrological data of the canal.
    The Tibet Power Station Engineering Team was established on April 1st for the construction of the Lhasa Hydropower Plant and the Xigaze Thermal Power Plant. The engineering team currently has more than 70 technical personnel in civil engineering, mechanical and electrical installation, and geology. The majority of these personnel are dispatched by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, including 18 members of the Tibet Engineering Survey Team. Recently, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry will send another batch of technical personnel to participate in the work of the power station engineering team. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Sichuan to Build Four New Fertilizer Plants This Year
    Sichuan Province will build three new phosphate fertilizer plants and one steel slag phosphate fertilizer plant this year, and will also expand one phosphate fertilizer plant. This year, it will prove 2.5 million tons of phosphate ore reserves and conduct a general survey of 70 square kilometers. At the same time, the trial production of high-grade chemical phosphate fertilizer, as well as the mineral processing work to provide high-grade phosphate ore powder for "superphosphate," will also be carried out.
    This year, the province's investment in the fertilizer industry will account for 21.1% of the total local industrial investment in the province. The output is expected to be 2.7 times the total fertilizer output of Sichuan Province in the previous three years, which can be used for 5.5 million mu of farmland. (Gui Chengduo)

    建设内地
    支援内地石油勘探工作
    玉门油矿最近又有六个地球物理勘探队、三个地质队、两个钻井队和一批技术人员先后出发，去青海柴达木盆地、新疆、四川等地支援石油勘探工作。
    玉门油矿为了以技术力量大力支援兄弟单位的石油工业建设，在今年第一季度已经调出了四个钻井队、一个试油队和近三百名包括有地震、重磁力、地质、钻井、电测、试油、机械等各种不同工种的工程师、技术员和技术管理干部，前去支援柴达木盆地、新疆、四川等地的石油勘探工作和兰州炼油厂的建厂工程。　（据新华社讯）
    包头增加一股新的电流
    包头发电厂十日向全市各基本建设工地输出了一股新的电流。这个厂原来计划在五月一日投入生产的一部新发电机提前发电了。
    包头市今年要新建和扩建许多为钢铁联合企业建设服务的工厂，基本建设工作量比去年增加了224％。包头发电厂为支援这些基本建设工程的用电需要，去年五月开始扩建两部新发电机。目前，另一部发电机正在安装。（新华社）
    新疆南部兴建两个大蚕种场
    新疆维吾尔自治区南部桑树密布的墨玉、莎车两县，正在兴建两处目前西北地区最大的蚕种场。墨玉蚕种场占地一千亩，莎车蚕种场占地八百亩。两场共育蚕种九万盒。
    两场在兴建蚕房的时候，还栽种新桑树苗七百多亩。（新华社）
    建设拉萨水力发电厂
    电力工业部西藏电站工程组已经展开工作。几天来，他们查勘了拉萨水力发电厂的地质情况和水渠的中心线路。现在正进一步为水渠地质和水文资料作补测和钻探工作。
    西藏电站工程组是为建设拉萨水力发电厂和日喀则火力发电厂于四月一日成立的。电站工程组现有土木、机电安装、地质等技术人员七十多名，这些人员绝大部分是电力工业部派来的，其中有十八人是西藏工程勘察队的队员。最近，电力工业部还要派一批技术人员来参加电站工程组工作。（据新华社讯）
    四川今年要新建四座肥料厂
    四川省今年将新建三座磷肥厂和一座钢渣磷肥厂，还要扩建一座磷肥厂。今年将探明磷矿储量二百五十万吨，普查七十平方公里。同时，高级化学磷肥试制工作，以及为“过磷酸钙”提供高品位磷矿粉的选矿工作也都要进行。
    今年全省肥料工业投资要占全省地方工业投资总额的21.1％，产量预计将为四川省前三年肥料产量总和的二点七倍，可供五百五十万亩农田施用。　（桂承铎）
