Prime Minister U Nu's Reply to Premier Zhou
Dear Premier:
    I am writing to thank you for your letter of April 9, in which you expressed, to me and through me to the Government and people of the Union of Burma, the congratulations of yourself and the Government and people of the People's Republic of China on the inauguration of the air route between our two countries.
    I wish to reciprocate these sentiments on behalf of the Government and people of the Union of Burma and on my own behalf. I also firmly believe that the opening of this air route between our two countries will further strengthen the bonds that unite us in sincere friendship.
    U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, April 11, 1956
