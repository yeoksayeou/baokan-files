Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 19th: As the May Day International Labor Day approaches, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a message stating that today, May Day is not only a day of international solidarity for the working class, but also a day for all people striving for peace, independence, democracy, and social progress to enhance international friendship and strengthen joint action.
    The message pointed out the characteristics of the current international situation and criticized the鳩山（Hatoyama) government's policy of running counter to the trend of Asian and world peace and independence. The Japanese Communist Party expressed its opposition to the small constituency system that attempts to achieve a dictatorship of the Liberal Democratic Party and demanded the dissolution of the Diet.

    The slogans called on the Japanese people to demand the abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the Administrative Agreement, and the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement, to demand the complete removal of military bases, and to immediately return Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan.
    The slogans also called on the Japanese people to further expand the movement, demanding the immediate resumption of Japan-Soviet negotiations, so that the negotiations can quickly reach an agreement; and demanded that the Japanese government seek to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and North Korea.
    The slogans opposed the United States' attempt to establish an anti-communist military system, demanded the realization of an Asian collective security system and comprehensive disarmament, demanded the promotion of equal and mutually beneficial trade, free exchange of economic and cultural ties, and the establishment of friendly relations between Japan and Asian and world countries.
