    On the Xilingol Grassland
    Sun Zhu
    The old maps don't show a place called "Xilinhot." A century ago, a Mongolian Beizi (a noble title) built a Lama temple here, and for many years the place was called Beizi Temple. Xilinhot was born with the founding of the People's Republic of China, and it takes its name from the Xilin River. Not long ago, there were only dozens of dilapidated mud houses here. Now, over a thousand new-style buildings covering an area of approximately 70,000 square meters have sprung up, and the population has increased from a few hundred to more than 11,000. Three li southeast of Xilinhot, tall chimneys spew blue smoke. This is the Xilinhot Power Plant, which began generating electricity on National Day in 1954. With its power generation, many factories serving animal husbandry production, such as wool weaving, dairy chemistry, and leather making, will be established here. Facing the power plant from afar is the three-story meteorological station, which promptly sends out warnings of climate changes to the herdsmen, so they no longer have to worry about sudden snowstorms.
    I traveled over 300 li north from Xilinhot by horse-drawn cart and ox cart, and lived for a short time with the herdsman Damulinzha's family near the border. In this remote frontier, I not only saw the rare flat-topped mountains and the boundless pastures, the marmots and gazelles of the grassland, but also witnessed the changes in the Mongolian yurts and the light of the new life.
    "If you had lived in my home in the past, you would have felt uncomfortable." One day, when we were talking about the past life of the herdsmen, Damulinzha said, "At that time, our Mongolian yurts could not keep out the rain in summer or the wind in winter, and were so dilapidated that they didn't look like anything. They weren't like the complete felt covers we have now." I followed his gesture and saw that, although the yurt top and wall felts were slightly blackened by smoke, they still retained their complete, new appearance. The ground was covered with thick felt. In this yurt, I saw wooden bowls and bronze utensils, white sheepskin robes and coarse cloth clothes. However, I also noticed that they had porcelain bowls and enamel basins, silk shirts and more fine cloth clothes, as well as beautiful high boots and toothbrushes... The herdsmen drink milk tea three times a day, just as people in the interior need dishes and soup with their meals. Damulinzha told me, "In the past, no one knew how much a brick of tea cost. The cheapest you could get it for was one sheep." Now, people no longer worry about bricks of tea. Last autumn, Damulinzha caught seventy-odd marmots in twenty days. The marmot meat could be eaten, and the marmot skins were purchased by the cooperative for two yuan each. With this money, he could buy forty bricks of tea, enough for his whole family to use for two years. There are four people in Damulinzha's family, and his old mother is over seventy years old. The old mother told me that her life "started at the age of sixty-five," because in that year her family not only had their own livestock, but also her thirty-two-year-old son got married. Now she has a two-year-old granddaughter. Damulinzha's family has more than 260 sheep, 32 head of cattle, and two horses, averaging more than seventy head of livestock per person. If they get another batch of lambs and calves this spring, the average number of livestock per person will exceed one hundred.
    Damulinzha's Dawa Gehot (residents' group) has eight yurts with seven herdsmen families, totaling twenty-three people. Among them are three elderly people, eight middle-aged people, five young people, and seven children. The total number of young people and children is more than the number of middle-aged people, and even more than the number of elderly people. This Hot, like the entire Xilingol League, has seen a thriving population due to free treatment for venereal diseases, reversing the terrible trend of population decline and no longer being an "inverted pyramid" shape where the younger the age, the fewer the people. The two school-age children in this Hot, Yadamu and Ba Gaerde Ni, are attending primary school. Youth League members Nuoerbo and Dundao Bu, like many young herdsmen, have learned to read "Herdsman's Newspaper" and "Inner Mongolia Daily" through winter school studies. The era of "illiteracy" on the grassland will forever be a thing of the past.
    In the Second Baga (village) of the Sixth Zuo of the Western United Banner, I visited the female Baga head, Xia Musulun.
    Nineteen years ago, when Xia Musulun was seventeen years old, she married her lover Su. Besides true love, the young couple had only two cows and one horse, and their life was very difficult. Like many herdsmen, they longed for a happy life and wanted to exchange their labor for livestock. Xia Musulun had worked as a herdsman and laborer for Zhang Jing (official) Man Dengnalan and the noble Peng Caige. When the scorching sun made the marmots afraid to come out of their holes, and when the severe cold froze the earth and cracked it, Xia Musulun had to drive the livestock to graze in the pastures. When she returned in the morning and evening, she also had to make milk tea, milk the cows, and collect cow dung for the master. The only price for this hard work was to get the master's used, blackened felt, which she took home to cover her dilapidated yurt, blocking the cold wind of the north...
    Year after year, that's how the days went by. After eleven years, the grassland was liberated! From then on, like many serfs and hired workers, Xia Musulun's years of suffering ended, and the happy life she had longed for for many years began.
    The liberation of the grassland gave Xia Musulun a life of free labor. This life brought her infinite energy and joy. In 1948, she responded to the call of the People's Government and went to Xilinhot to attend a midwife training class. In 1951, the People's Government universally issued livestock production loans and "Suruk" sheep (lambing and grazing) to poor herdsmen. Xia Musulun received 150 "Suruk" sheep. Three years later, she returned 195 sheep to the government, including principal and interest, leaving her with more than 200 adult lambs. Xia Musulun, who had never had even one sheep before, was so happy to hear the "baa" of her hundreds of sheep! But she also knew who gave her this happiness. Therefore, in addition to taking good care of her own livestock, she conscientiously devoted herself to the midwife duties entrusted to her by the government. Once, in order to help Nasenburg's wife Nuojima give birth, she stayed at Nasenburg's house day and night for seven days. Because of her serious and responsible work, she was successively elected as a model midwife four times. In September 1955, when the herdsmen group was reorganized into a Baga, she was unanimously elected by the herdsmen as the Baga head. A month later, she was also elected as a representative to the Inner Mongolia Women's Congress.
    Now, Xia Musulun and her husband, daughter, and young son, a family of four, live a prosperous life. Her family has all five kinds of livestock on the grassland: nearly 400 sheep and goats, more than 20 cattle, two horses, two camels, and three carts. Her spacious Mongolian yurt has a piece of glass inlaid on top, making the yurt bright and cheerful. Xia Musulun told me that her family also has a yurt that was taken by the mutual aid group to go "Aoter" (nomadic).
    Like many herdsmen and Xia Musulun, more and more livestock, everyone feels that it is difficult to graze alone, so last November, with Xia Musulun's family as the center of the Hot, a perennial mutual aid group for animal husbandry production was organized to carry out collective grazing. In this way, not only was the difficulty of insufficient manpower overcome, but there was also full protection against overcoming natural disasters.
    Like countless herdsmen, Xia Musulun was a serf of the princes and nobles in the old society, and became the master of the grassland in the new society. In the old society, herdsmen longed for a happy life, but what they got was hard work accompanied by disappointment. Now, a happy life has become a reality because of their labor.

    在锡林郭勒草原
    孙竹
    旧的地图上，找不到“锡林浩特”这个地方。百年前有个蒙族贝子（爵号）在这里盖了一座喇嘛庙，多年来这个地方一直被叫做贝子庙。锡林浩特，是随着中华人民共和国的诞生而诞生的，它因为锡林河而得名。不久以前，这儿只有几十间破旧的土房，现在，占地约七万平方公尺的一千多座新式建筑物已经耸立起来，人口由几百人增加到一万一千多人。离锡林浩特三里路远的东南方，高大的烟囱吐着蓝烟，这是1954年国庆节开始发电的锡林浩特发电厂。随着它的发电，毛织、牛乳化学、制革等许多为牧业生产服务的工厂，都将在这里建立起来。同发电厂遥遥相对的是三层楼房的气象台，它及时向牧民发出气候变化的警报，牧民们再也不要担心大风雪的突然袭击了。
    我从锡林浩特先后乘马车、牛车往北走了三百多里路，在接近边境的地方，和牧民达木林扎一家生活过一个短短的时期。在这遥远的边疆，我不仅看到了稀奇的平顶山和无边的牧场，看到了草原上的旱獭和黄羊，而且也看到了蒙古包的变迁和新生活的光芒。
    “从前，你若是在我家里住，你会感到不舒服的。”一天当我们谈起牧民过去生活的时候，达木林扎这样说：“那时，我们的蒙古包夏不挡雨、冬不挡风，破旧得不像个样，哪有现在这样整片的毡子。”我顺着他的手势看去，无论是包顶毡还是壁毡，虽然被烟熏得微微发黑，但仍不失它那完整的新模样。地上铺的是厚厚的毡子。在这个包里，我看到有木碗和铜器，有白碴皮袄和粗布衣服。然而我也注意到他们有磁碗和搪瓷盆，有绸衫和更多的细布衣服，还有漂亮的高筒靴和牙刷……。牧民们每天要喝三遍奶茶，就像内地人用饭需要菜和汤一样。达木林扎告诉我：“过去没有人知道一块砖茶多少钱，最便宜也得拿一支羊去换。”现在，人们再也不为砖茶发愁了。去年秋天，达木林扎在二十天中打了七十来支旱獭，獭肉可以吃，獭皮由合作社收购，每张两元钱。他用这笔钱可以买到四十块砖茶，够全家用两年。达木林扎家有四口人，老妈妈年过七十。老妈妈对我说，她的生活是“从六十五岁开始的”，因为那年她家不仅有了自己的牲畜，而且她的三十二岁儿子成了家。现在她已经有了两岁的小孙女了。达木林扎全家有羊二百六十多支，牛三十二头，马两匹，平均每人有七十多头牲畜。今春再接一次羊羔和牛犊，每人平均的牲畜数便过百了。
    达木林扎所在的达瓦格浩特（居民小组），有八个蒙古包七家牧民，共二十三口人。其中老年人三人，中年人八人，青年五人，小孩七人。青年和小孩的总和比中年人多，比老年人更多。这个浩特和整个锡林郭勒盟一样，由于经过性病的免费治疗，人口兴旺起来，扭转了那可怕的人口衰退的趋势，不再是“倒金字塔形”、年龄越小的人越少了。这个浩特的雅达木和巴嘎额尔德妮，两个达到学龄的儿童，正在小学念书。青年团员诺尔博和顿道布，像许多年青牧民一样，经过冬学学习，现在已经能够阅读“牧民报”和“内蒙古日报”。草原上“目不识丁”的时代，将永远成为过去的了。
    在西部联合旗六佐二巴嘎（村），我访问了女巴嘎长霞姆苏伦。
    十九年前，当霞姆苏伦十七岁的时候，她和她的爱人苏结了婚。这对年青夫妇除去真实的爱情以外，家里只有两头牛、一匹马，生活非常困难。他们像许多牧民一样，憧憬着幸福的生活，想用自己的劳动换来牲畜。霞姆苏伦，先后给章京（官）蛮登那兰和贵族彭采格放过牲口和做过工。当灼热的太阳使旱獭都不敢出洞的时候，当严寒把大地都冻得裂缝的时候，霞姆苏伦也要赶着牲畜在牧场上游动。早晚回来，她还得给主人烧奶茶、挤牛奶和拾牛粪。这种辛勤劳动的唯一代价，就是可以得到主人用过的污黑的毡子，她把它拿回家去蒙在自己那千疮百孔的包上，挡一挡北国的寒风……。
    一年又一年，日子就是这样过去的。过了十一年，草原解放了！从此，霞姆苏伦和许多牧奴雇工一样，苦难的岁月结束了，多年来想望的幸福生活开始了。
    草原的解放使霞姆苏伦有了自由劳动的生活。这种生活给她带来无限的精力和喜悦。1948年，她响应人民政府的号召，到锡林浩特参加接生员训练班学习。1951年人民政府普遍给贫苦牧民发放牧业生产贷款和“苏鲁克”羊（分羔放牧）。霞姆苏伦接到一百五十支“苏鲁克”羊，三年后连本加利归还政府195支羊，她净剩下二百多支大羊羔。从前连一支羊都没有的霞姆苏伦，现在听见自己几百支羊的“咩咩”叫声，她是多么快乐啊！但是她也知道这快乐是谁给她的。于是，她除了照料好自己的牲畜之外，尽心地努力于政府委托给她的接生员的职务。有一次，为了给那森布尔格的爱人诺基玛助产，她在那森布尔格家昼夜守候了七天。由于她对工作认真负责，先后当选了四次模范接生员。1955年9月，牧民组改建为巴嘎的时候，她被牧民一致选为巴嘎长。一个月以后，她又被选为内蒙古妇女代表大会的代表。
    现在，霞姆苏伦和她的丈夫、女儿、小儿子一家四口人过着富裕的生活。草原上的五种牲畜她家全有了：绵羊和山羊近四百支，牛二十多头，马两匹，骆驼两头，并且有车三辆。她那宽适的蒙古包顶上镶着一块玻璃，包里显得明快畅亮。霞姆苏伦告诉我，她家还有一个包，由互助组的人带着走“敖特尔”（游牧）去了。
    许多牧民和霞姆苏伦一样，牲畜越来越多，大家都感到单独放牧力不从心、困难重重，于是在去年十一月，以霞姆苏伦家为中心的浩特，组织起牧业生产常年互助组，进行合群放牧。这样，不独克服了人力不足的困难，而且对于战胜自然灾害也有了充分的保障。
    霞姆苏伦和无数牧民一样，在旧社会是王公贵族的牧奴，在新社会成了草原的主人。在旧社会牧民们渴望幸福生活，得到的却是劳苦伴随着失望，现在幸福生活已经由于他们的劳动成为现实了。
