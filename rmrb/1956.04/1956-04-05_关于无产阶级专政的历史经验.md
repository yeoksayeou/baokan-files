(This article was written by the editorial department of the People's Daily based on the discussions of the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.)

    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) summarized new experiences in international relations and domestic construction, and made a series of significant decisions, including firmly implementing Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, developing the Soviet democratic system, implementing the principle of collective leadership of the Party, criticizing shortcomings within the Party, and stipulating the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.
    The issue of opposing the cult of personality occupied an important position at the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The 20th Congress sharply exposed the prevalence of the cult of personality, a phenomenon that had caused many errors and adverse consequences in Soviet life for a long time. This courageous self-criticism by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding its past mistakes demonstrates the high degree of principle and the great vitality of Marxism-Leninism in the Party's internal life.
    In past history, and in all capitalist countries today, no ruling party or political group serving the exploiting classes has dared to seriously expose its serious mistakes to its party members and the people. The political party of the working class is entirely different. The political party of the working class is a party that serves the broad masses of the people. For them, practicing self-criticism will lose nothing but mistakes, and what they gain is the support of the broad masses of the people.
    Over the past month or so, reactionaries all over the world have been gleefully talking about the self-criticism of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the cult of personality. They say: Good! The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the first country in the world to establish a socialist system, has actually made serious mistakes, and it was made by Stalin, a leading figure with great fame and honor. Reactionaries think they have now seized a handle that can be used to slander the Soviet Union and communist parties around the world. However, the reactionaries are ultimately "wearing themselves out for nothing." In what works have the representatives of Marxism ever said that we will never make mistakes, or that a certain communist will absolutely never make mistakes? Isn't the system of criticism and self-criticism in our Communist Party's internal life because we Marxist-Leninists have always denied that there are any "god-men" who will not commit errors, whether large or small? Moreover, how can one imagine that a socialist country that is the first in the world to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat will not commit this or that kind of error?
    In October 1921, Lenin said:
    "Let the dying bourgeoisie and the lackeys and swine of the petty-bourgeois democratic system who are dependent on it attack us with endless curses, abuses, and ridicule, and accuse us of failures and mistakes in the Soviet system we have built in our country. We have not forgotten for a minute that our failures and mistakes in our work, whether in the past or present, are indeed numerous. In such a novel undertaking in world history, namely, creating a new type of state system unprecedented in history, how can there be no failures and mistakes! We will fight unyieldingly to correct our failures and mistakes, and strive to improve our methods of practically applying Soviet principles, which are far from perfect."
    It is also impossible to imagine that having made certain mistakes in the initial stage will inevitably mean that one will never make certain other mistakes again, and that one will not more or less repeat the original mistakes. Since human society split into several classes with different interests, it has experienced the dictatorship of slave owners, the dictatorship of feudal lords, and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. These dictatorships continued for thousands of years. Since the victory of the October Revolution, mankind has only begun to experience the dictatorship of the proletariat. The first three dictatorships were dictatorships of the exploiting classes, but the dictatorship of feudal lords was more progressive than the dictatorship of slave owners, and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie was more progressive than the dictatorship of feudal lords. These exploiting classes, which once played a certain progressive role in the history of social development, always made countless historical mistakes over a long period of time, and repeatedly committed them, in order to accumulate their ruling experience. However, as the contradiction between the relations of production they represent and the productive forces intensifies, they will inevitably make greater and more mistakes, provoking large-scale resistance from the oppressed classes and the disintegration of themselves from within, thereby promoting their own demise. The dictatorship of the proletariat is fundamentally different in nature from any previous dictatorship of the exploiting classes. It is the dictatorship of the exploited classes, the dictatorship of the majority over the minority, the dictatorship for the purpose of creating a socialist society without exploitation and poverty, and it is the most progressive and last dictatorship in human history. Such a dictatorship bears the greatest and most difficult task in history, faces the most complex and tortuous struggles in history, and therefore its work—as Lenin said—cannot but make many mistakes. If some communists become proud and complacent and their thinking becomes rigid, then they may even repeat the mistakes they have made in the past or that others have made. This is something that we communists must fully estimate. In order to defeat powerful enemies, the dictatorship of the proletariat requires a high degree of centralization of power. This highly centralized power must be combined with a high degree of democracy. When centralism is unilaterally emphasized, many mistakes will occur. This is something that people can fully understand. However, no matter what mistakes there are, for the masses of the people, the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat is always far superior to the system of any dictatorship of the exploiting classes, and far superior to the system of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Lenin was right when he said: "If our enemies accuse us and say: Look, Lenin himself admits that the Bolsheviks have done a lot of stupid things; then I would like to answer them like this: Yes, but do you know that our stupidity is ultimately of a completely different nature than yours." For the purpose of plunder, the exploiting classes always hope that their dictatorship can be maintained forever, passed down from generation to generation, and thus use every means to torture the people, and their mistakes cannot be overcome. However, for the purpose of liberating the people materially and spiritually, the proletariat is to use its own dictatorship conditions to realize communism, realize human unity, and gradually make its own dictatorship disappear. They must therefore give full play to the initiative and active role of the masses of the people. The possibility of the infinite development of the initiative and active role of the people under the dictatorship of the proletariat also contains the possibility of overcoming various mistakes made in the era of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    The responsibility of various leaders of the Communist Party and socialist countries is to minimize errors, avoid certain serious errors, pay attention to drawing lessons from individual, local, and temporary errors, and strive to prevent certain individual, local, and temporary errors from becoming national and long-term errors. To achieve this goal, every leader must be very cautious and humble, closely connect with the masses, consult with the masses on everything, repeatedly investigate and study the actual situation, and regularly conduct appropriate and well-deserved criticism and self-criticism. Stalin, as the main leader of the Party and the state, made some serious mistakes in his later work because he did not do this. He became arrogant and imprudent. Subjectivism and one-sidedness arose in his thinking. He made wrong decisions on certain major issues, causing serious adverse consequences.
    Thanks to the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, led by Lenin, first built a socialist society on one-sixth of the earth's surface. The Soviet Union rapidly realized socialist industrialization, realized the collectivization of agriculture, developed socialist science and culture, and formed a solid union of multiple nationalities within the country in the form of the Soviet Union. The originally backward nations in the Soviet Union became socialist nations. During World War II, the Soviet Union became the main force in defeating fascism, saved European civilization, and helped the Eastern people defeat Japanese militarism. All these brilliant achievements pointed out the bright future of socialism and communism to all mankind, greatly shook the rule of imperialism, and made the Soviet Union the first strong fortress in the struggle for lasting peace in the world. The Soviet Union inspired and supported the construction of all other socialist countries, and inspired the socialist movement, the anti-colonial movement, and all movements for human progress around the world. These are all great achievements created by the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in human history. It was Lenin who pointed out the path for the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to create such great achievements. In the struggle to realize Lenin's policy, there is credit for the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, including Stalin's indelible credit.
    After the death of Lenin, Stalin, as the main leader of the Party and the state, creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism; in the struggle to defend the legacy of Leninism and oppose the enemies of Marxism-Leninism—the Trotskyites, Zinovievites, and other bourgeois agents—he expressed the will of the people and was worthy of being an outstanding Marxist-Leninist fighter. Stalin won the support of the Soviet people and played an important role in history primarily because he and other leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union together maintained Lenin's line on the industrialization of the Soviet state and the collectivization of agriculture. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union implemented this line, which led to the victory of the socialist system in the Soviet Union and created the conditions for the Soviet Union to win the war against Hitler. All these victories of the Soviet people were in line with the interests of the world's working class and all progressive humanity. Therefore, Stalin's name naturally enjoyed high honor in the world at the same time. However, when Stalin correctly applied the Leninist line and gained high honor among the people at home and abroad, he mistakenly exaggerated his role to an inappropriate position, placed his personal power in opposition to collective leadership, and as a result, made some of his actions and some of the basic Marxist-Leninist viewpoints he originally advocated stand in opposition to each other. On the one hand, he acknowledged that the masses of the people are the creators of history, acknowledged that the Party must always be in contact with the masses, and must develop democracy within the Party, develop self-criticism and criticism from below. On the other hand, he accepted and encouraged the cult of personality and practiced personal autocracy. This put Stalin in a contradiction between theory and practice on this issue in his later period.
    Marxist-Leninists believe that leaders play a great role in history. The people and the people's party need advanced figures who can represent the interests and will of the people, stand at the forefront of the historical struggle, and lead the masses of the people. Denying the role of the individual, denying the role of advanced figures and leaders, is completely wrong. However, any leader of the Party and the state, when he does not put the individual in the Party and the masses, but instead puts the individual above the Party and the masses, when he is divorced from the masses, he will lose a comprehensive understanding of the affairs of the state. As long as this is the case, even an outstanding figure like Stalin will inevitably make unrealistic and wrong decisions on certain major issues. Stalin failed to learn lessons from individual, local, and temporary mistakes on certain issues, so that these mistakes did not become serious errors on a national and long-term scale. In his later life, Stalin increasingly indulged in the cult of personality, violated the Party's democratic centralism, and violated the system of combining collective leadership and individual responsibility. As a result, he made some major mistakes, such as: expanding the scope of the anti-purge; lacking necessary vigilance on the eve of the anti-fascist war; lacking due attention to the further development of agriculture and the material welfare of farmers; and making some wrong ideas in the international communist movement, especially making wrong decisions on the Yugoslavia issue. On these issues, Stalin fell into subjectivity and one-sidedness, divorced from the objective reality and divorced from the masses.
    The cult of personality is a corrupt legacy left over from the long history of mankind. The cult of personality has its basis not only among the exploiting classes, but also among small producers. As everyone knows, the patriarchal system is a product of small-scale production economy. After the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, even if the exploiting classes are eliminated, the small-scale production economy has been replaced by the collective economy, and a socialist society has been built, some of the decadent and poisonous ideological remnants of the old society will still be preserved in people's minds for a long time. "The force of habit of millions is the most terrible force" (Lenin). The cult of personality is also a habit of millions of people. Since this habit still exists in society, it is possible to influence many state workers, and even leaders like Stalin were affected by this influence. The cult of personality is a reflection of social phenomena in people's minds. When leaders of the Party and the state like Stalin also accept the influence of this backward ideology, it will in turn affect society, causing losses to the cause and harming the initiative and creativity of the masses.
    The developing socialist productive forces, socialist economic system, and political system, and the life of the Party are increasingly contradicting and conflicting with this kind of spiritual state of the cult of personality. The struggle against the cult of personality launched by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a great and courageous struggle for Soviet communists and the Soviet people to clear ideological obstacles on the road to progress.
    There are some naive ideas that seem to think that there will be no more contradictions in socialist society. To deny the existence of contradictions is to deny dialectics. The nature of contradictions in each society is different, and the ways to resolve contradictions are different, but the development of society is always carried out in constant contradictions. The development of socialist society is also carried out in the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production. In socialist and communist societies, the phenomenon of technological innovation and social system innovation will inevitably continue to occur. Otherwise, the development of society will stop and society will not be able to move forward. Mankind is still in its youth. The road that mankind will take in the future will be many times longer than the road it has taken in the past. Contradictions such as innovation and conservatism, advanced and backward, positive and negative will continue to appear under various different conditions and in various different situations. Everything will still be like this: one contradiction will lead to another contradiction, and when the old contradiction is resolved, a new contradiction will arise. Some people believe that the contradiction between idealism and materialism can be eliminated in socialist or communist society. This view is obviously incorrect. As long as the contradiction between the subjective and the objective still exists, the contradiction between the advanced and the backward still exists, and the contradiction between social productive forces and relations of production still exists, then the contradiction between materialism and idealism will still exist in socialist and communist society, and will still be expressed in various forms. People live in society and will reflect the contradictions in various societies to varying degrees under various circumstances. Therefore, even in communist society, not everyone will be perfect. At that time, people themselves will still have their own contradictions, there will still be good people and bad people, and there will still be people with more correct ideas and people with less correct ideas. Therefore, there will still be struggles between people, but the nature and form of the struggles will be different from those in class society. In this way, it is not surprising that there are contradictions between individuals and collectives in socialist society. If any leaders of the Party and the state are divorced from collective leadership, divorced from the masses of the people, and divorced from real life, they will inevitably harden their thinking and make serious mistakes. What we must be vigilant about is that some people, when the Party and the state have made many achievements and gained the high trust of the masses of the people, may use this trust to abuse their authority and do some wrong things.
    The Communist Party of China celebrates the great achievements made by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in its historically significant struggle against the cult of personality. The experience of the Chinese revolution also proves that only by relying on the wisdom of the masses of the people, relying on democratic centralism, and relying on the system of combining collective leadership and individual responsibility can our Party achieve great victories and achievements in both the revolutionary period and the period of national construction. In the past, the Communist Party of China has constantly opposed individual prominence and individual heroism that are divorced from the masses in the revolutionary ranks. There is no doubt that phenomena such as individual prominence and individual heroism that are divorced from the masses will continue to exist for a long time. Once overcome, it will reappear next time. Sometimes it is manifested by these people, and sometimes it is manifested by other people. When people pay attention to the role of the individual, they often cannot see the role of the masses and the collective. Therefore, some people can easily make mistakes of arrogance, believing in themselves, or blindly worshiping others. Therefore, opposing individual prominence and individual heroism that are divorced from the masses, and opposing the cult of personality, are issues that should be given constant attention.
    In order to oppose subjective leadership methods, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision on leadership methods in June 1943. When talking about the issue of collective leadership of the Party now, it will still be beneficial for all members of the Communist Party of China and all its leaders to mention this decision. This decision writes: "In all our Party's practical work, all correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses. That is to say, the opinions of the masses (scattered and unsystematic opinions) are concentrated (after research, transformed into concentrated and systematic opinions), and then they are publicized and explained to the masses, transformed into the opinions of the masses, so that the masses adhere to them, see them in action, and test whether these opinions are correct in the actions of the masses. Then they are concentrated from the masses again and adhered to in the masses again. This is an infinite cycle, each time more correct, more vivid, and more abundant. This is the Marxist epistemology." For a long time, within our Party, such leadership methods have been given a popular name, called the "mass line." The entire history of our work tells us that those who abide by this line always do good or better work, and even if they make mistakes, they are easy to correct; those who violate this line always encounter setbacks in their work. This is the Marxist-Leninist leadership method, this is the Marxist-Leninist work line. After the victory of the revolution, when the working class and the Communist Party have become the class and party leading the national regime, our Party and state leading staff are facing a great danger of possibly using state organs to act arbitrarily, being divorced from the masses, being divorced from collective leadership, practicing commandism, and destroying the democratic system of the Party and the state due to the multifaceted attacks of bureaucracy. Therefore, if we do not want to fall into such a quagmire, we must pay full attention to implementing this kind of mass line leadership method, and should not neglect it in the slightest. To this end, we need to establish certain systems to ensure the implementation of the mass line and collective leadership, and avoid individual prominence and individual heroism that are divorced from the masses, and reduce the subjectivism and one-sidedness in our work that are divorced from objective reality.
    We must also learn from the struggle of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union against the cult of personality and continue to launch the struggle against dogmatism.
    The working class and other people win the revolution and win state power under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, and the victory of the revolution and the establishment of revolutionary power open up infinitely broad roads for the development of Marxism-Leninism. However, because Marxism is recognized as the national guiding ideology after the victory of the revolution, this makes many of our propaganda workers often only rely on administrative power and the prestige of the Party to instill Marxism-Leninism into the masses as dogma, rather than working hard, mastering a large amount of material, and using the Marxist-Leninist method of analysis, in the language of the people, to convincingly explain the unity of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific conditions of China. In recent years, we have made some achievements in the research fields of philosophy, economics, history, and literary criticism, but in general, there are still many unhealthy states. Many of our research workers still carry the habits of dogmatism, tying their thoughts to a rope, lacking the ability to think independently and the spirit of creativity, and also accepting the influence of the cult of Stalin in some respects. It must be pointed out here that Stalin's works are still as necessary to be studied seriously as in the past. All the useful things in his works, especially his many works on defending Leninism and correctly summarizing the experience of Soviet construction, we need to accept as an important historical heritage. Not doing so would be wrong. However, there can be two research methods: one is the Marxist method, and the other is the dogmatic method. Some people use the dogmatic method to view Stalin's works, and as a result, they cannot analyze the correct aspects and the incorrect aspects. Even for the correct content, they regard it as a panacea and apply it uniformly. This inevitably leads to errors. For example, Stalin once had such a formula: In various different revolutionary periods, the basic direction of attack is to isolate the social and political forces in the middle at that time. Stalin's formula should be viewed differently from the Marxist critical point of view. Under certain conditions, isolating the middle forces can be correct. But it is not correct to isolate the middle forces under all conditions. According to our experience, the main direction of attack in the revolution should be placed on the most important enemy to isolate it. For the middle forces, a policy of both uniting and struggling should be adopted, at least to neutralize them, and efforts should be made to win them over from a neutral position, so that they can form an alliance with us, so as to be conducive to the development of the revolution. However, there was a period (the ten-year civil war period from 1927 to 1936) when some of our comrades simply copied Stalin's formula to the Chinese revolution, directing the main direction of attack at the middle forces, calling them the most dangerous enemies. As a result, the real enemy was not isolated, but they were isolated themselves, suffered losses, and benefited the real enemy. In view of this dogmatic error, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to defeat the Japanese invaders, put forward the policy of "developing progressive forces, winning over the middle forces, and isolating the die-hard forces." The progressive forces referred to here are the forces of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals led and possibly influenced by the Communist Party. The middle forces referred to here are the national bourgeoisie, various democratic parties, and non-party democratic人士. The die-hard forces referred to here are the comprador feudal forces headed by Chiang Kai-shek, who practiced passive resistance against Japan and active anti-communism. Practical experience has proved that this policy of the Communist Party of China is suitable for the situation of the Chinese revolution and is correct.
    The fact is always like this: dogmatism is only appreciated by ideological loafers, and it is harmful and useless to the revolution, to the people, and to Marxism-Leninism. It is still necessary to break the superstition of dogmatism from the aspects of improving the people's self-awareness, encouraging the people's vigorous pioneering spirit, and promoting the rapid development of practical work and theoretical work.
    The dictatorship of the proletariat (in China, it is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class) has now achieved great victories within the scope of 900 million people on the earth. Whether in the Soviet Union, in China, or in other people's democratic countries, there are their own successful experiences and erroneous experiences. We should continue to summarize these experiences. We must be vigilant: we may still make mistakes in the future. The important lesson is that our Party's leading organs should limit errors to the scope of individual, local, and temporary, and should not allow individual, local, and preliminary errors to become national or long-term errors.
    In the history of the Communist Party of China, there have been several experiences of making serious mistakes. During the revolutionary period from 1924 to 1927, our Party had a right-leaning opportunist erroneous line represented by Chen Duxiu. During the revolutionary period from 1927 to 1936, our Party had three "left"-leaning opportunist erroneous lines, among which the Li Lisan line and the Wang Ming line were particularly serious. The former occurred in 1930, and the latter occurred from 1931 to 1934. The Wang Ming line was the most damaging to the revolution. During this period, an anti-Party Zhang Guotao right-leaning opportunist erroneous line that opposed the Party's Central Committee also occurred in an important revolutionary base area. This erroneous line seriously damaged some important revolutionary forces. The mistakes made in the above two periods, except for the Zhang Guotao line which was an error of an important revolutionary base area, were all national errors. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party had another right-leaning opportunist erroneous line represented by Comrade Wang Ming. However, because our Party learned the lessons of the previous two revolutionary periods, it did not allow this erroneous line to develop. This erroneous line was corrected by our Party's Central Committee in a relatively short period of time. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, in 1953, our Party had another anti-Party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi. This anti-Party alliance represented reactionary forces at home and abroad and aimed at harming the revolutionary cause. If the Party Central Committee had not discovered it early and promptly smashed this anti-Party alliance, the losses to the Party and the revolutionary cause would have been unimaginable.
    It can be seen from this that our Party's historical experience is also that it has tempered itself in the process of fighting against various erroneous lines, and thus achieved great revolutionary and construction victories. As for local and individual errors, they often occur in work. Only by relying on the collective wisdom of the Party and the wisdom of the masses of the people, and exposing and overcoming them in a timely manner, can they not get the opportunity to develop, and have not become national and long-term errors, and have not become major errors that harm the people.
    Communists must adopt an analytical attitude towards the errors that have occurred in the communist movement. Some people think that Stalin was completely wrong, which is a serious misunderstanding. Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist, but he was also a Marxist-Leninist who made several serious mistakes without realizing they were mistakes. We should look at Stalin from a historical point of view, make a comprehensive and appropriate analysis of his correct and wrong places, and thus draw useful lessons. Whether it is his correct place or his wrong place, it is a phenomenon of the international communist movement, with the characteristics of the times. On the whole, the international communist movement has only been a little over a hundred years, and only thirty-nine years since the victory of the October Revolution. There is still insufficient experience in many revolutionary works. We have great achievements, but there are still shortcomings and errors. Just as one achievement appears and then creates new achievements, when one shortcoming or error is overcome, a new shortcoming or error may arise and needs to be overcome by us. Achievements are always more than shortcomings, correct places are always more than wrong places, and shortcomings and errors are always to be overcome. Good leaders are not those who do not make mistakes, but those who seriously treat mistakes. People who never make mistakes have never existed in the world. Lenin said: "Openly admitting mistakes, exposing the causes of mistakes, analyzing the environment in which mistakes arise, and carefully discussing ways to correct mistakes—this is the sign of a solemn party, this is the party fulfilling its obligations, this is the education and training of the class, and even the masses." The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is following Lenin's legacy and is now seriously dealing with certain serious mistakes made by Stalin in leading socialist construction and the consequences left behind. Due to the seriousness of its consequences, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union needs to sharply expose the essence of the mistakes made by Stalin while affirming Stalin's great achievements, calling on the whole Party to take this as a warning and resolutely eliminate the adverse consequences caused by this error. We Chinese communists firmly believe that after this sharp criticism by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, all the positive factors that were severely suppressed by certain erroneous policies in the past will universally become active. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people will be more united than in the past and will struggle to build a great communist society that mankind has never seen before and strive for lasting peace in the world.
    All reactionary forces in the world are ridiculing this matter. They are ridiculing us for overcoming our own mistakes in our camp. What will be the result of this ridicule? There is no doubt that the result will be that a great camp of peace and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, which is stronger and forever invincible than in the past, will stand before them, while the man-eating business of the ridiculers is not very pleasant.
    The fact is always like this: dogmatism is only appreciated by ideological loafers, and it is harmful and useless to the revolution, to the people, and to Marxism-Leninism.

  （这篇文章是根据中国共产党中央政治局扩大会议的讨论，由人民日报编辑部写成的）
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会总结了国际关系和国内建设的新经验，作出了关于坚定地执行列宁的社会制度不同的各国可以和平共处的政策、发展苏维埃的民主制度、贯彻遵守党的集体领导的原则、批判党内的缺点、规定发展国民经济的第六个五年计划等等一系列的重大决定。
    反对个人崇拜的问题，在苏共二十次代表大会中占有重要的地位。二十次代表大会非常尖锐地揭露了个人崇拜的流行，这种现象曾经在一个长时间内的苏联生活中，造成了许多工作上的错误和不良的后果。苏联共产党对于自己有过的错误所进行的这一个勇敢的自我批评，表现了党内生活的高度原则性和马克思列宁主义的伟大生命力。
    在过去历史上，在现在一切的资本主义国家中，没有任何一个为剥削阶级服务的当权政党或者政治集团敢于在自己的党员群众面前，在人民群众面前，认真地揭露自己的严重错误。工人阶级的政党就完全是另外一回事。工人阶级的政党是为广大人民群众服务的政党，对于它们说来，实行自我批评，除了失掉错误以外，什么都不会失掉，而所得到的却是广大人民群众的拥护。
    世界上的一切反动派，在最近一个多月以来，兴高采烈地谈论苏联共产党关于个人崇拜的自我批评。他们说：好！世界上第一个建立社会主义制度的苏联共产党居然犯了严重的错误，而且还是一个有很大声名和荣誉的领导人物斯大林犯了这样的错误。反动派以为他们现在是抓住了一个能够用来中伤苏联和世界各国共产党的把柄了。可是，反动派毕竟是“心劳日拙”的。马克思主义的代表人物在什么著作中曾经说过我们是永远不会犯错误的，或者曾经说过某一个共产党人是绝对不会犯错误的呢？我们共产党人的党内生活所以有批评和自我批评的制度，难道不是因为我们马克思列宁主义者从来就否认有什么不会犯或大或小的错误的“神人”吗？何况一个在世界上史无前例的首先实行无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，怎样能够设想它不会犯这样或那样的错误呢？
    一九二一年十月间，列宁说过：
    “让垂死的资产阶级和依附着它的小资产阶级民主制度的走狗和瘟猪们，用层出不穷的诅咒、谩骂、嘲笑来攻击我们，责难我们所建设的我国苏维埃制度中的失利和错误吧。我们一分钟也没有忘记，我们工作中的失利和错误，无论过去或现在，确实是很多的。在这样的全世界历史上的新奇事业，即创立空前未见的新式国家制度中，难道能够没有失利和错误吗！我们将百折不回地来为纠正我们的失利和错误而奋斗，力求改善我们实际运用苏维埃原则这方面还远未完善的方法。”
    也不可能设想：初期有过某些错误，就将命定地永远不会再犯某些其他的错误，而且命定地不会或多或少地再犯原来有过的错误。自从人类社会分裂为几个利害不同的阶级以来，经历过奴隶主的专政，封建主的专政，资产阶级的专政，这些专政继续了几千年；而从十月革命胜利以后，人类才开始经历无产阶级的专政。前三个专政都是剥削阶级的专政，但是封建主的专政比奴隶主的专政要进步些，资产阶级的专政又比封建主的专政要进步些。这些在社会发展史上曾经起过一定进步作用的剥削阶级，总是在很长的时期中犯过无数历史性的错误，而且是反复地一犯再犯，才能积累他们的统治经验。但是随着他们所代表的生产关系同生产力之间的矛盾的尖锐化，他们仍然不可避免地要犯更大更多的错误，激起被压迫阶级的大规模反抗和他们自己内部的分崩离析，以至促进了自己的灭亡。无产阶级的专政和以前任何剥削阶级的专政，在性质上根本不同。它是被剥削阶级的专政，是多数人对少数人的专政，是为着创造没有剥削、没有贫困的社会主义社会的专政，是人类历史上最进步的也是最后一次的专政。这样的专政，担负着历史上最伟大、最困难的任务，面对着历史上情况最复杂和道路最曲折的斗争，因而它的工作——正如列宁所说的——也不能不犯很多的错误。如果有些共产党人发生骄傲自满和思想硬化的情形，那么，他们甚至也会重犯过去自己犯过的或者别人犯过的错误。这一点，我们共产党人是必须充分地估计到的。为着战胜强大的敌人，无产阶级专政要求权力的高度集中。这个高度集中的权力，是必须和高度的民主相结合的。当着集中制被片面地强调了的时候，就会出现许多错误。这一点，也是人们所完全能够理解的。可是，无论有怎样的错误，对于人民群众说来，无产阶级专政的制度，比起一切剥削阶级专政的制度，比起资产阶级专政的制度，总是具有极大的优越性。列宁说得很对：“如果我们的敌人责难我们说：看，列宁自己也承认，布尔什维克做了大量的蠢事；那我就想这样来回答他们：对的，但是你们是否知道，我们的蠢处较之你们说来，终究完全是另一种性质的。”剥削阶级为了掠夺的目的，总是希望使他们的专政能够永远保持下去，由一世传到万世，因而用尽千方百计来折磨人民，他们的错误是无法克服的。但是无产阶级为了在物质上和精神上解放人民的目的，却是要利用自己的专政条件，实现共产主义，实现人类大同，让自己的专政逐步地消逝下去，因而就要尽量地发挥人民群众的主动精神和积极作用。而人民群众的主动精神和积极作用在无产阶级专政之下的无限发挥的可能性，也就包含着克服无产阶级专政时代所犯各种错误的可能性。
    共产党和社会主义国家的各种领导人物的责任是要尽量减少错误，尽量避免某些严重的错误，注意从个别的、局部的、暂时的错误中取得教训，力求使某些个别的、局部的、暂时的错误不至于变成全国性的、长时期的错误。而要达到这种目的，就要求每个领导者都十分谨慎和谦逊，密切地联系群众，遇事和群众商量，反复地调查研究实际的情况，经常进行适合情况的、恰如其分的批评和自我批评。作为党和国家主要领导人的斯大林，在他后一个时期的工作中所以犯了某些严重的错误，就是因为他没有这样做。他骄傲了，不谨慎了，他的思想里产生了主观主义，产生了片面性，对于某些重大问题做出了错误的决定，造成了严重的不良后果。
    由于伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，苏联人民和苏联共产党，在列宁的领导之下，在世界六分之一的地面上，首先建成了社会主义社会。苏联迅速地实现了社会主义的工业化，实现了农业的集体化，发展了社会主义的科学和文化，在苏维埃联盟的形式下形成了国内多民族的巩固的联盟，苏联国内原来落后的民族变成了社会主义的民族。在第二次世界大战中，苏联成为打败法西斯的主力，挽救了欧洲的文明，并且帮助东方人民打败了日本军国主义。这一切灿烂的成就，给全人类指出了社会主义和共产主义的光明前途，大大地动摇了帝国主义的统治，使苏联在全世界争取持久和平的斗争中成为第一个坚强的堡垒。苏联鼓舞和支持了所有其他的社会主义国家的建设，鼓舞了全世界的社会主义运动、反殖民主义运动和一切争取人类进步的运动。这些都是苏联人民和苏联共产党在人类历史上所创造的伟大业绩。给苏联人民和苏联共产党指出创造这种伟大业绩的道路的，是列宁。在为实现列宁的方针而进行的斗争中，有苏联共产党中央委员会强有力的领导的功劳，其中就有斯大林的不可磨灭的功劳。
    在列宁逝世之后，作为党和国家的主要领导人物的斯大林，创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义；在保卫列宁主义遗产、反对列宁主义的敌人——托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子和其他资产阶级代理人的斗争中，他表达了人民的意愿，不愧为杰出的马克思列宁主义的战士。斯大林所以赢得苏联人民的拥护，在历史上起了重要的作用，首先就是因为他和苏联共产党的其他领导人在一起维护了列宁的关于苏维埃国家工业化和农业集体化的路线。苏联共产党实行了这条路线，使社会主义制度在苏联取得了胜利，并且造成了苏联在反希特勒的战争中取得胜利的条件，而苏联人民的这一切胜利是同全世界工人阶级和一切进步人类的利益相一致的。因此，斯大林这个名字也就很自然地同时在世界上享有很高的荣誉。但是，当着斯大林正确地运用列宁主义的路线而在国内外人民中获得很高的荣誉的时候，他却错误地把自己的作用夸大到不适当的地位，把他个人的权力放在和集体领导相对立的地位，结果也就使自己的某些行动和自己原来所宣传的某些马克思列宁主义的基本观点处于相对立的地位。一方面承认人民群众是历史的创造者，承认党必须永远地联系群众，必须发展党内民主，发展自我批评和自下而上的批评，另一方面却又接受和鼓励个人崇拜，实行个人专断，这就使得斯大林后一时期在这个问题上陷于理论和实践相脱节的矛盾。
    马克思列宁主义者认为领导人物在历史上有很大的作用。人民和人民的政党需要有能够代表人民的利益和意志、站在历史斗争的前列，而领导人民群众的先进人物。否认个人的作用，否认先进人物和领导人物的作用，这是完全错误的。但是，党和国家的任何一个领导人，当他不是把个人放在党和群众之中，而是相反地把个人放在党和群众之上的时候，当他脱离了群众的时候，他对于国家的事务就会失去全面的洞察力。只要是这样，即使像斯大林这样杰出的人物，对于某些重大的事务，也不可避免地要作出不合实际的错误的决定。斯大林在某些问题上没有能够从个别的、局部的、暂时的错误中引出教训，而使这些错误不致变为全国范围的和长时期的严重错误。斯大林在他一生的后期，愈陷愈深地欣赏个人崇拜，违反党的民主集中制，违反集体领导和个人负责相结合的制度，因而发生了例如以下的一些重大的错误：在肃反问题上扩大化；在反法西斯战争前夜缺乏必要的警惕；对于农业的进一步发展和农民的物质福利缺乏应有的注意；在国际共产主义运动中出了一些错误的主意，特别是在南斯拉夫问题上作了错误的决定。斯大林在这些问题上，陷入了主观性和片面性，脱离了客观实际状况，脱离了群众。
    个人崇拜是过去人类长时期历史所留下的一种腐朽的遗产。个人崇拜不只在剥削阶级中间有它的基础，也在小生产者中间有它的基础。大家知道，家长制就是小生产经济的产物。在无产阶级专政建立之后，即使剥削阶级消灭了，小生产经济已经由集体经济所代替了，社会主义社会建成了，但是旧社会的腐朽的、带有毒素的某些思想残余，还会在人们的头脑中，在一个很长的时期内保存下来。“千百万人的习惯势力是最可怕的势力”（列宁）。个人崇拜也就是千百万人的一种习惯势力。这种习惯势力既然在社会中还存在着，也就有可能给予许多国家工作人员以影响，甚至像斯大林这样的领导人物也受了这种影响。个人崇拜是社会现象在人们头脑中的反映，而当像斯大林这样的党和国家的领导人物也接受这种落后思想的影响的时候，就会反转过来再影响给社会，造成事业的损失，有害于人民群众的主动性和创造性。
    发展着的社会主义的生产力、社会主义的经济制度和政治制度、党的生活，日益和个人崇拜这类精神状态互相矛盾着，互相冲突着。苏联共产党二十次代表大会展开的反对个人崇拜的斗争，正是苏联共产党人和苏联人民在前进道路上扫清思想阻碍物的一个伟大的、勇敢的斗争。
    有一些天真烂漫的想法，仿佛认为在社会主义社会中是不会再有矛盾存在了。否认矛盾存在，就是否认辩证法。各个社会的矛盾性质不同，解决矛盾的方式不同，但是社会的发展总是在不断的矛盾中进行的。社会主义社会的发展也是在生产力和生产关系的矛盾中进行着的。在社会主义社会和共产主义社会中，技术革新和社会制度革新的现象，都将是必然要继续发生的，否则，社会的发展就将停止下来，社会就不可能再前进了。人类现在还是在青年时代。人类将来要走的路，将比过去走过的路，不知道要长远得多少倍。革新和守旧，先进和落后，积极和消极这类矛盾，都将不断地在各种不同的条件下和各种不同的情况中出现。一切都还将是这样：一个矛盾将导致另一个矛盾，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会产生。有些人认为唯心论和唯物论的矛盾可以在社会主义社会或者共产主义社会中消除掉，这个意见显然是不正确的。只要还存在着主观和客观的矛盾，还存在着先进和落后的矛盾，还存在着社会生产力和生产关系的矛盾，那末，唯物论和唯心论的矛盾在社会主义社会和共产主义社会中也就还将存在，还将经过各种各样的形式表现出来。人们是在社会中生活着的，也就会在各种不同的情况和不同的程度上，反映各个社会中的矛盾。所以，即使到了共产主义社会，也不会是每个人都是完满无缺的。那个时候，人们本身也还将有自己的矛盾，还将有好人和坏人，还将有思想比较正确的人和思想比较不正确的人。因此，人们之间也还将有斗争，不过斗争的性质和形式不同于阶级社会罢了。这样看来，在社会主义社会中，存在着个人和集体的矛盾现象，并不是一件什么奇怪的事。而任何党和国家的领导人物如果脱离集体领导，脱离人民群众，脱离实际生活，他们就必然会使自己的思想硬化起来，以致做出严重的错误。对于我们必须警惕的，就是：有些人当他们因为党和国家有了很多工作成绩，取得人民群众的高度信任的时候，便有可能利用这种群众的信任去滥用权威，做出一些错事来。
    中国共产党庆祝苏联共产党在反对个人崇拜这一个有历史意义的斗争中所得到的重大成就。中国革命的经验同样证明：只有依靠人民群众的智慧，依靠民主集中制，依靠集体领导和个人负责相结合的制度，才使我们党不论在革命时期或者在国家建设时期都能够取得伟大的胜利和成就。中国共产党过去在革命队伍中曾经不断地反对脱离群众的个人突出和个人英雄主义。毫无疑义，脱离群众的个人突出和个人英雄主义这一类现象还是会长期存在的。一次克服了，下次还会再出现。有时由这一些人表现出来，有时又由另一些人表现出来。人们在注意到个人作用的时候，常常会看不见群众和集体的作用。所以，有些人就很容易犯出狂妄自大、迷信自己、或者盲目崇拜别人的错误。因此，反对脱离群众的个人突出和个人英雄主义，反对个人崇拜，是应该经常加以注意的问题。
    为了反对主观主义的领导方法，中国共产党中央委员会在一九四三年六月间，曾经作出了一个关于领导方法的决定。在现在说到有关党的集体领导问题的时候，提一下这个决定，对于中国共产党全体党员和它的一切领导人员说来，将仍然是有好处的。这个决定写道：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。这就是说，将群众的意见（分散的无系统的意见）集中起来（经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见），又到群众中去作宣传解释，化为群众的意见，使群众坚持下去，见之于行动，并在群众行动中考验这些意见是否正确。然后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。如此无限循环，一次比一次地更正确、更生动、更丰富。这就是马克思主义的认识论。”长时期以来，在我们党内，对于这样的领导方法，曾经给它起了一个通俗的名称，叫做“群众路线”。我们工作的全部历史告诉我们：凡是遵守这条路线的，工作总是好的或者较好的，即使犯了错误，也易于改正；凡是违背这条路线的，工作总是遇到挫折。这是马克思列宁主义的领导方法，这是马克思列宁主义的工作路线。当革命胜利之后，在工人阶级和共产党已经成为领导全国政权的阶级和政党的时候，我们党和国家的领导工作人员，由于受到官僚主义的多方面的袭击，就面临到有可能利用国家机关独断独行、脱离群众、脱离集体领导、实行命令主义、破坏党和国家的民主制度的这样一个很大的危险性。因此，我们要是不愿意陷到这样的泥坑里去的话，也就更加要充分地注意执行这样一种群众路线的领导方法，而不应当稍为疏忽。为此，我们需要建立一定的制度来保证群众路线和集体领导的贯彻实施，而避免脱离群众的个人突出和个人英雄主义，减少我们工作中的脱离客观实际情况的主观主义和片面性。
    我们也还必须从苏联共产党反对个人崇拜的斗争中吸取教训，继续展开反对教条主义的斗争。
    工人阶级和其他人民群众在马克思列宁主义的指导之下赢得革命，赢得国家政权，而革命的胜利和革命政权的建立又为马克思列宁主义的发展开拓无限广阔的道路。但是，因为马克思主义在革命胜利以后被公认为全国的指导思想，这就使得我们有不少宣传工作者常常只是依靠行政权力和党的威信，把马克思列宁主义当成教条灌输给群众，而不是辛勤努力，掌握大量材料，用马克思列宁主义的分析方法，用人民的语言，很有说服力地去说明马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国具体情况的统一。若干年来，我们在哲学、经济学、历史和文艺批评的研究领域中有了一些成绩，但是一般说来，还有许多不健康的状态存在着。我们有不少的研究工作者至今仍然带着教条主义的习气，把自己的思想束缚在一条绳子上面，缺乏独立思考的能力和创造的精神，也在某些方面接受了对于斯大林个人崇拜的影响。这里必须指出，斯大林的著作仍然和过去一样是必须认真研究的，凡是他的著作中有益的东西，特别是他关于保卫列宁主义和正确地总结苏联建设经验的许多著作，我们都需要当做一项重要的历史遗产接受过来。不这样做，就是错误的。但是，可以有两种研究方法：一种是马克思主义的方法，一种是教条主义的方法。有些人用教条主义的方法去看待斯大林的著作，结果是不能分析其中的正确方面和不正确方面，就是对于其中的正确内容，也是当作万应灵药，千篇一律地加以应用，这样就不可避免地要犯错误。例如斯大林曾经有过这样的公式：在各种不同的革命时期，基本的打击方向是使那个时候的中间的社会政治力量陷于孤立。对于斯大林这个公式，就应该用马克思主义的批判观点有分别地看待它。在某种条件下，孤立中间势力可以是正确的。但是并不是在一切条件下，孤立中间势力都是正确的。按照我们的经验，革命的主要打击方向应该放在最主要的敌人身上，使它孤立，而对于中间势力，则应该采用又联合又斗争的政策，至少使它中立，并且应该力求在可能的条件下，争取它从中立的地位转变过来，使它和我们成立联盟，以便有利于革命的发展。可是，曾经有一个时期（一九二七年至一九三六年的十年内战时期），我们的一些同志简单地搬用斯大林的这个公式到中国革命中来，把主要的打击方向对着中间势力，把它说成是最危险的敌人，结果没有孤立真正的敌人，反而使自己陷于孤立，使自己吃了亏，而有利于真正的敌人。鉴于这种教条主义的错误，中国共产党中央委员会在抗日战争时期，为了打败日本侵略者，提出了“发展进步势力、争取中间势力、孤立顽固势力”的方针。这里所指的进步势力，就是共产党所领导和可能影响的工人、农民和革命知识分子的力量。这里所指的中间势力，就是民族资产阶级、各民主党派和无党派的民主人士。这里所指的顽固势力，就是那些实行消极抗日积极反共的、以蒋介石为首的买办封建势力。实践的经验证明，中国共产党的这个方针是适合于中国革命的情况的，是正确的。
    事实总是这样：教条主义只是思想懒汉才会加以欣赏的东西，它对于革命，对于人民，对于马克思列宁主义，都是有百害而无一利的。从提高人民群众的自觉、鼓舞人民群众的生气勃勃的首创精神、促进实际工作和理论工作的迅速发展等等方面说来，破除教条主义的迷信，现在仍然是必要的。
    无产阶级专政（在中国是工人阶级领导的人民民主专政）现在已经在地球上九亿人口的范围内取得了伟大的胜利。无论在苏联，在中国，在其他人民民主国家，都有自己的成功的经验和错误的经验。我们应该继续地总结这些经验。必须有这样的警惕：以后我们还是可能犯错误的。重要的教训，就是我们党的领导机关应该使错误限制在个别的、局部的、暂时的范围内，而不应该让个别的、局部的和初步出现的错误变为全国性的或者长时期的错误。
    在中国共产党的历史上有过几次犯严重错误的经验。在一九二四年到一九二七年的革命时期，我们党内出现了以陈独秀为代表的右倾机会主义的错误路线。在一九二七年到一九三六年的革命时期，我们党内出现了三次“左”倾机会主义的错误路线，其中特别严重的是李立三路线和王明路线，前者是在一九三○年发生的，后者是在一九三一年至一九三四年发生的，而以王明路线对于革命的损害最为严重。在这个时期内，在一个重要的革命根据地里还发生了同党的中央相对抗的反党的张国焘右倾机会主义的错误路线，这条错误路线严重地损害了一部分重要的革命力量。上述两个时期内所犯的错误，除了张国焘路线是属于一个重要革命根据地的错误以外，都是全国性的错误。在抗日战争时期，我们党内又出现了以王明同志为代表的右倾机会主义的错误路线，但是由于我们党吸取了以前两个革命时期的教训，没有让这条错误路线发展下去，这条错误路线在较短的时间内就被我们党的中央所纠正。在中华人民共和国成立以后，在一九五三年，我们党内又出现了高岗、饶漱石的反党联盟。这个反党联盟代表国内外的反动势力，而以危害革命事业为目的。如果不是党中央发觉得早，及时地击破了这个反党联盟的话，党和革命事业的损失将会是不堪设想的。
    由此可见，我们党的历史经验，也是在自己同各种错误路线作斗争的过程中使自己获得了锻炼，因此取得了伟大的革命胜利和建设胜利的。至于局部的和个别的错误，则在工作中时常发生，仅仅是依赖党的集体智慧和人民群众的智慧，及时地加以揭露和克服，才使它们不能获得发展的机会，没有成为全国性的和长期性的错误，没有成为危害人民的大错误。
    共产党人对于共产主义运动中所发生的错误，必须采取分析的态度。有些人认为斯大林完全错了，这是严重的误解。斯大林是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义者，但是也是一个犯了几个严重错误而不自觉其为错误的马克思列宁主义者。我们应当用历史的观点看斯大林，对于他的正确的地方和错误的地方作出全面的和适当的分析，从而吸取有益的教训。不论是他的正确的地方，或者错误的地方，都是国际共产主义运动的一种现象，带有时代的特点。整个说来，国际共产主义运动还只有一百年多一点的时间，从十月革命胜利以来，还只有三十九年的时间，许多革命工作的经验还是不足的。我们有伟大的成绩，但是还有缺点和错误。如同一个成绩出现了接着又创造新的成绩一样，一个缺点或错误克服了，新的缺点或错误又可能产生，又有待于我们去克服。而成绩总是多于缺点，正确的地方总是多于错误的地方，缺点和错误总是要被克服的。好的领导者不在于不犯错误，而在于认真地对待错误。完全不犯错误的人在世界上是从来没有的。列宁说：“公开承认错误，揭露错误的原因，分析产生错误的环境，仔细讨论改正错误的方法——这才是郑重的党的标志，这才是党执行自己的义务，这才是教育和训练阶级，以至于群众。”苏联共产党遵循列宁的遗教，现在正在认真地对待斯大林在领导社会主义建设中所犯的某些性质严重的错误及其所遗留的后果。由于其后果的严重性，所以苏联共产党有必要在肯定斯大林的伟大功绩的同时，又尖锐地揭露斯大林所犯的错误的实质，号召全党以此为戒，坚决地消除这种错误所造成的不良后果。我们中国共产党人深信，经过苏联共产党二十次代表大会这一次尖锐的批判之后，过去被某些错误政策所严重地压抑了的一切积极因素，必将普遍地活跃起来，苏联共产党和苏联人民将比较过去更好地团结一致，为了建设一个人类从来没有看见过的伟大的共产主义社会和争取全世界的持久和平而奋斗。
    世界上一切反动势力正在讥笑这件事，他们在讥笑我们阵营中克服自己的错误。这种讥笑会有什么结果呢？毫无疑义，结果将是在他们面前站着一个比较过去更加强大和永远不可战胜的以苏联为首的和平和社会主义的伟大阵营，而讥笑者们的吃人事业却是很不美妙的。
    事实总是这样：教条主义只是思想懒汉才会加以欣赏的东西，它对于革命，对于人民，对于马克思列宁主义，都是有百害而无一利的。从提高人民群众的自觉、鼓舞人民群众的生气勃勃的首创精神、促进实际工作和理论工作的迅速发展等等方面说来，破除教条主义的迷信，现在仍然是必要的。
