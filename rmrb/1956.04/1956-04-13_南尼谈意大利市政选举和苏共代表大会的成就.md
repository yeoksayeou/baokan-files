Xinhua News Agency, Rome, April 11th (TASS) – The Central Committee of the Italian Socialist Party opened its plenary session in Rome on April 9th and concluded on the 10th. The meeting discussed the political situation created by the unfolding election campaign for local autonomous bodies. The General Secretary of the Socialist Party, Nenni, delivered a report on this issue.

He said that the Socialist Party would put forward independent candidate lists in towns with a population of more than 10,000 (where seats will be distributed in proportion to the number of votes obtained by each party's candidates). In towns with a population of less than 10,000 (where elections will be held according to the majority vote system), the Socialist Party will put forward democratic candidate lists together with the Communist Party and other progressive forces.

Nenni said: It should be said that the bourgeois parties are too narrow-minded in reducing all the work of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the issue of the struggle against the cult of personality. In reality, "for us, the most important thing in this Congress is: its contribution to the policy of easing international tensions and in the study of ideological and principled issues such as the various paths to socialism and the issue of war not being inevitable."...

Nenni said, "One of the most positive achievements of the 20th Congress is its impact on international relations, which is manifested in many initiatives to ease international tensions."

Nenni said: Major changes are taking place in the Western camp, the Atlantic group is in a deep crisis, and the policy of strength has failed. "The movement forward on the road to disarmament and collective security will continue," but in any case, we should not relax our vigilance against difficulties.

The plenary session adopted a resolution on the issues discussed.

    南尼谈意大利市政选举和苏共代表大会的成就
    新华社据塔斯社罗马11日讯　意大利社会党中央委员会全体会议四月九日在罗马开幕，十日结束。会议讨论由于展开地方自治机关选举的选举运动而造成的政治形势。社会党总书记南尼就这个问题作了报告。
    他说，社会党将在人口在一万人以上的各市镇（这些地方的席位将按各党派的候选人所得的票数的比例分配）提出独立的候选人名单，在人口不到一万人的市镇（这些地方的选举将根据过半数的选举制进行），社会党将同共产党和其他进步力量一道提出民主候选人名单。
    南尼说：资产阶级政党把苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的全部工作降低到一个同个人崇拜作斗争的问题，应当说是眼光太狭小了，而实际上“对我们来说，这次代表大会中最重要的东西是：它对缓和国际紧张局势的政策和在研究诸如关于走向社会主义的各种道路问题和关于战争不是不可避免的问题这些观念形态和原则问题方面的贡献”。……
    南尼说，“第二十次代表大会的最积极的成就之一，是它对国际关系的影响，这在为缓和国际紧张局势而作的许多倡举上表现了出来”。
    南尼说：西方阵营正发生着重大的变化，大西洋集团处在深刻危机中，实力政策失败了。“在裁军和集体安全道路上向前发展的运动将继续下去”，但是，无论如何，我们都不应当对困难放松警惕。
    全体会议就所讨论的问题通过决议。
