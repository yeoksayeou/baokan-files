To welcome the May Day International Labor Day and the first anniversary of the farm's establishment, the workers of the State-owned Friendship Farm are taking practical actions to seize time and ensure quality in sowing wheat. The Party Committee of the State-owned Friendship Farm issued instructions to launch a high-quality wheat sowing campaign, and labor competitions were launched between production teams and tractor groups in each branch farm. Since the 36th tractor of the Second Production Team began sowing on April 8th, it has consistently exceeded the shift quota and maintained excellent quality. The 11th and 12th Production Teams adopted an inspection method combining leadership and the masses, and immediately corrected any problems with quality. The 92nd tractor group led by Yu Hongmin of the 12th Production Team continuously won the mobile red flag from the 7th to the 17th, and on the 17th, they created the highest record in the entire branch farm by sowing 62.8 hectares in eleven hours (the quota is forty hectares in ten hours). The 54th tractor group led by Zhan Qingguo of the 11th Production Team created another excellent achievement of breaking 70 hectares on the 18th. Both production teams completed their wheat sowing tasks ahead of schedule on the 18th. The farm's leaders and Soviet experts go deep into the fields every day to check the sowing quality and progress. As of the 18th, the entire farm had sown nearly 6,000 hectares. Now all the workers are striving to complete the wheat sowing task of more than 15,000 hectares around the 25th. (Our reporter stationed in Jiamusi)

    迎接五一劳动节和建场一周年
    国营友谊农场开展麦播优良质量运动
    国营友谊农场的职工们在播种小麦中，以争取时间并保证质量的实际行动，迎接五一国际劳动节和建场一周年。中共国营友谊农场党委曾为此发出了开展麦播优良质量运动的指示，各分场的生产队和机车组之间开展了劳动竞赛。第二生产队三十六号机车从四月八日开始播种以来，始终逐日上升地突破班次定额并保持着优良质量。第十一、十二生产队采取了领导与群众相结合的检查方法，发现质量不好，立即进行纠正。第十二生产队于洪民领导的九十二号机车组从七日至十七日连续不断地获得流动红旗，他们十七日以十一小时播种62.8公顷（定额是十小时四十公顷）创造了全分场的最高纪录。十一生产队战庆国领导的五十四号机车组十八日又创造了突破七十公顷的优良成绩。这两个生产队都于十八日提前完成了麦播任务。场的领导人员和苏联专家们每天深入田间检查播种质量和进度，截至十八日，全场已播种近六千公顷，现在全场职工们正努力争取在二十五日左右完成全场一万五千余公顷的麦播任务。（本报驻佳木斯记者）
