To the Editor:

    The spring fishing season is now in full swing in the fishing grounds near the Shandong Peninsula. Fishing boats from the Weiguo Fishery Production Cooperative in the Laoshan suburb of Qingdao are setting sail one after another. The cooperative members are actively engaged in a socialist production increase competition, ensuring the production of more aquatic products for the motherland.

    The Weiguo Cooperative is a large cooperative formed mainly from five small cooperatives, absorbing nine mutual aid teams and some independent fishermen, totaling 367 households. After several months of consolidation since its establishment last winter, the superiority of the large cooperative has already become apparent.

    In the past, due to simple tools, fishermen – including those in smaller cooperatives – could not engage in production year-round. For example, the original Xin Jian Cooperative, with twenty-five households, had only two larger sailboats, mainly engaged in drift net fishing. After the spring fishing season, they could engage in shark fishing for another two months, after which they would have to remain idle. Now, the large cooperative has eleven types of fishing gear. Not only can it appropriately divide the labor organization according to the specialties of each member, but it can also coordinate various tools for year-round operations and multiple tool operations. For example, small drift net boats start by digging clams and fishing for sharks in the spring. During the spring fishing season, they concentrate their efforts on setting drift nets. In the summer, they dig clams and fish for sharks. After autumn, they set autumn drift nets, allowing for more than nine months of work.

    In the past, because the investment required for fishery production was large, ordinary fishermen often found it difficult to repair boats and add nets. Now, the large cooperative has pooled production funds, giving it the strength to expand production equipment. For example, the "Licheng" cooperative's pair of motorized sailboats was repaired with a large investment by the large cooperative this year. The fish and shrimp produced since setting sail in late March have greatly increased compared to the past. In addition, the entire cooperative has newly built fifteen fishing sailboats this year and added 682 various fishing nets and 1,500 baskets of fishing hook lines.

    In the past, due to the limitations of boats, nets, and tools, fishermen concentrated in Jiaozhou Bay for offshore operations during the netting season each year. Because there were few fishing grounds and many boats and nets, disputes often arose. After the establishment of the large cooperative, it uniformly arranged fishing grounds according to the boat and net equipment of the entire cooperative. In addition to allowing some small fishing boats to remain in Jiaozhou Bay and along the Qingdao coast for shallow sea and beach operations, most boats went to the Bohai Sea, Shidao, Lianyungang and other places for operations. In this way, not only did disputes over fishing grounds no longer occur, but also many dead fishing grounds near the Shandong Peninsula became active fishing grounds.

    The Weiguo Cooperative plans to produce 3.15 million jin of various fish and shrimp this year, with the output per boat increasing by 48.3% compared to last year, and the income of cooperative members increasing by more than 30% compared to last year.

    Since mid-March, various fishing boats have set sail one after another. As of April 6, more than 38,000 jin of fish and shrimp had been produced. The cooperative members have high morale, and production teams have launched challenges and responses, full of confidence to complete or exceed the annual production plan.

    供给人民更多的水产编辑同志：
    目前，山东半岛附近渔场的大海市已经来到了。青岛崂山郊区卫国渔业生产合作社的渔船正在陆续出海。社员们积极开展了社会主义增产竞赛，保证为祖国生产更多的水产。
    卫国社是以五个小型社为主、吸收九个互助组和部分单干渔民组成的一处大社，共有社员367户。这个社在去年冬季建成以后，经过几个月的整顿巩固，已经显示了大社的优越性。
    过去，由于工具简单，渔民们——包括规模较小的社——不能常年进行生产。如原来的新建社共二十五户，只有两只较大的帆船，主要进行流网作业，春汛大海市结束后还可以进行两个多月的钓鲨作业，此后就只好闲起来了。现在大社里有十一种作业工具，不但可以根据每个社员的特长适当划分劳动组织，并且可以将各种工具配合起来进行常年作业和多种工具兼作业。如小流网船春起挖蛤蜊、钓鲨，春汛大海市集中力量放流网，伏季挖蛤蜊、钓鲨鱼，秋后放秋流网，这样能有九个多月的作业时间。
    过去，由于渔业生产需要的投资大，一般渔民要修船添网经常会感到困难。现在大社集中了生产资金，就有力量来扩大生产设备。像原来“立成”社的一对机帆船，今年由大社下了很大本钱进行修补，三月下旬出海所产鱼虾就比过去大大增加了。另外，全社今年还新造了十五只渔帆船，增添了各种渔网682块，钓钩线一千五百筐。
    过去，由于船网工具的限制，每年放网季节，渔民们都集中在胶州湾内进行近海作业；因为渔场少，船网多，经常引起纠纷。大社成立以后，就根据全社船网设备情况，统一的安排渔场，除了让部分小型渔船留在胶州湾内和青岛沿海进行浅海和滩涂作业外，大部分船都到渤海、石岛、连云港等地进行作业。这样，不但争渔场的纠纷不再发生了，而且使许多过去在山东半岛附近的死渔场变成了活渔场。
    卫国社今年计划生产各种鱼虾315万斤，每只船的产量要比去年提高48.3％，社员的收入也要比去年提高30％以上。
    自三月中旬以来，各种渔船就陆续出海。到四月六日止，已经生产了鱼虾三万八千多斤。社员们的生产情绪很高，各生产队之间提出了挑战应战，满怀信心地要完成或超额完成全年生产计划。
