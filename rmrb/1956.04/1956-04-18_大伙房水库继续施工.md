    Dahuofang Reservoir Construction Continues
    The Dahuofang Reservoir's construction for this year fully commenced on the 15th. The amount of work for the reservoir this year is equivalent to 60% of the total project. The people building this project are all working hard to complete this arduous task. The Youth Contract Group on Locomotive No. 540, which transports sand, gravel, and earth, exceeded the quota and increased efficiency by 53% in the first few hours of construction, creating a new record as the first on the entire construction site. The Communist Youth League excavator operators loaded 380 cubic meters of sand in five hours, exceeding the national quota by 30%. (Liaoning Daily Editorial Department)
