Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 5th: Tirana dispatch: The Third Session of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania was held in Tirana from April 2nd to 4th.

    The session discussed and adopted Albania's national budget for 1956, passed the Albanian Labor Law, and approved a number of decrees promulgated by the Presidium of the People's Assembly, among other things.

    Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, spoke at the session. He described Albania's achievements in socialist construction and discussed the results and significance of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    When discussing Albania's foreign policy, Shehu said: The Albanian government has consistently implemented the peaceful policy formulated by the Albanian Labor Party, and it considers it its sacred duty to maintain and strengthen relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries in Europe and Asia. The Albanian government has also made special efforts to strengthen Albania's relations with Yugoslavia. Good-neighborly relations now exist between our two countries, and there is a common desire to develop these relations with equality and sincere friendship. Our relations with Italy have made progress, although this progress has not been as rapid as we had hoped. Our government has shown sincerity in ending the problems arising from the peace treaty and hopes that the Italian government will show a more positive understanding. As for relations with Greece, although our government has made repeated efforts, no significant progress has been made in normalizing our relations with Greece. I believe that the establishment of normal relations and the exchange of diplomatic representatives between the two countries will promote the resolution of outstanding issues between the two countries.

    Shehu also pointed out that the Albanian government has recently established diplomatic relations with India and Austria and has reached an agreement with the Egyptian government to establish diplomatic relations. He said: We will strive to establish diplomatic relations with all countries that are willing to respect each other and not interfere in each other's internal affairs, especially with countries in the Middle East and Near East.

    谢胡在人民议会上谈阿尔巴尼亚的外交政策
    新华社布拉格5日电　地拉那消息：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会第三次会议，四月二日到四日在地拉那举行。
    这次会议讨论并且通过了1956年阿尔巴尼亚的国家预算，通过了阿尔巴尼亚劳动法，批准了人民议会主席团所颁布的一些法令等。
    阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡在这次会议上讲了话。他叙述了阿尔巴尼亚在社会主义建设中的成就，并且谈到了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的结果和意义。
    谢胡在谈到阿尔巴尼亚的外交政策时说：阿尔巴尼亚政府一贯执行阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所制定的和平政策，它认为维持和加强同苏联、中华人民共和国以及欧洲和亚洲其他人民民主国家的关系是它自己的神圣的职责。阿尔巴尼亚政府还特别努力来加强阿尔巴尼亚同南斯拉夫的关系。现在，我们两国之间存在着善邻的关系，并且存在有以平等和真诚友谊来发展这种关系的共同愿望。我们同意大利的关系已经有了进展，虽然这种进展没有达到我们期望的速度。我们政府在结束由于和约所产生的问题方面已经表现了诚意，希望意大利政府方面表现更积极的谅解。至于同希腊的关系，虽然我们政府作了一再的努力，但是在使我们同希腊关系的正常化方面还没有取得显著的进展。我相信，两国建立正常关系和互派外交代表将促进两国之间悬而未决的问题的解决。
    谢胡还指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府最近已经同印度、奥地利建立了外交关系，并且同埃及政府达成了建立外交关系的协议。他说：我们将努力和所有愿意互相尊重和不干涉他国内政的国家建立外交关系，首先是同中东和近东国家建立外交关系。
