Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 22nd - This morning at ten o'clock, a giant aircraft flew over Lhasa. This was specially sent by the Central People's Government to congratulate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. The aircraft crossed the towering snow mountains, rising four to five thousand meters above sea level, and entered the airspace over the Lhasa plain. At this time, the citizens of Lhasa flocked to the rooftops to cheer the arrival of the motherland's aircraft. The aircraft circled over Lhasa, scattering colored leaflets. Many citizens waved their arms from the rooftops for a long time to welcome the aircraft, and the crowds gathered in the streets scrambled to read the leaflets written in both Tibetan and Chinese.

    中央派飞机到拉萨上空贺喜
    新华社拉萨22日电  今天上午十时，一架巨型飞机飞临拉萨上空。这是中央人民政府特地派来祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会成立的。这架飞机越过拔海四、五千公尺以上的重重雪岭，进入了拉萨平原的上空。这时，拉萨市民纷纷涌上屋顶平台，欢呼祖国飞机的来临。飞机在拉萨市上空环绕飞行，撒下了彩色的传单。许多市民在屋顶上长久地挥着手臂迎接，拥挤在街头的人群，也争相阅读这些写着藏、汉两种文字的传单。
