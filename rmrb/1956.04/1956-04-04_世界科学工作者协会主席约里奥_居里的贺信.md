Dear Friends:

    As you gather today to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, I eagerly wish to join you, but I am simply unable to make this long journey. As I write this letter, I imagine you have already gathered together, and I hope to express all my excitement in words.

    When the founders of the World Federation of Scientific Workers met in 1946, humanity had just emerged from a terrible nightmare.

    Of course, the vile dictatorial rule of persecution and ignorance, which attempted to establish a "thousand-year imperium" in Europe and Asia, had been eliminated, but at what great cost! Destruction was everywhere, and memories of millions of dead remained everywhere.

    In the final moments of this terrible war, the atomic bomb appeared. Its enormous destructive power, and the use of atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki despite the far-sighted warnings of many of our American colleagues, immediately presented humanity with many new problems, at a time when people should have been united in a common desire for construction and friendship.

    All the delegates who attended the founding conference in London and the first session of the Executive Council in Paris, as well as the scientists they represented, deeply felt that the rapid development and application of science today would raise even more difficult questions than before, and that scientists who are aware of their responsibilities must not be indifferent to these questions.

    Of course, none of us would be unwilling to devote all our energy to science, and none of us would be unwilling to devote ourselves wholeheartedly to our research work without actively participating in other struggles. But we believe that it is impossible to adopt this attitude of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial; and our view is correct.

    The actions we have taken together have had an effect. We know that not every improvement in certain situations is due to our efforts alone, but in our common work, we have after all done our part. I will only give one example here, which is very typical. For example, many of you still remember how heavily the atmosphere of secrecy affected science when the World Federation of Scientific Workers was founded. For a long time, one of our main targets of struggle was against secrecy.

    At the Geneva Conference last summer, people could see how much progress had been made in the efforts to eliminate this secrecy.

    In this respect, not all problems have been fully resolved. Although we were pleased that a Chinese scientist was among our observers at this Geneva Conference, we cannot help but deeply regret that the Chinese government was not invited to send official representatives to participate.

    For ten years, we have always insisted that our actions comply with our organizational regulations and the spirit of the principles and preamble of our charter. Looking at these documents again today, I cannot help but think that they are completely relevant. I believe that in the future, these documents will still be our indispensable guide as we accomplish our tasks in science and society.

    In many countries, our association does not yet have branches, or our association's influence there is not great. This is the consequence of the serious international tension of the past ten years, which has fortunately eased today. Therefore, our task may not be so arduous, but we must still unite all scientists.

    Our education, the research methods we use, the universal source of the scientific heritage that we want to enrich, all of these make scientists have a common connection, which we may not always be fully aware of.

    The terrible destructive power of modern weapons clearly shows that science is being misused, and scientists should rise up against the misuse of science. In this regard, the profession of scientists makes them bear not only the responsibilities shared by all citizens of all countries, but also more responsibilities. If scientists cannot promptly make public the scientific basis that only they can provide, how can they blame their compatriots for being indifferent to the great dangers of modern warfare?

    Although this task is so important, it is only part of our responsibility. It is not enough to fight merely to prevent science from being used for destruction; we should also fight to immediately utilize the enormous possibilities of human progress. In this regard, scientists should also play an equally important role. If people do not recognize the possibility of moving towards progress, how can they resolutely demand that science be properly used to create wealth, eliminate poverty, fight disease, and reduce the labor intensity of various workers? If not scientists themselves, who can provide such effective materials?

    This is the responsibility that our association should first fulfill.

    In addition, by making public opinion aware of the possibility of moving towards progress, scientists can eliminate the now popular notion that science mainly brings terrible tools of destruction to mankind; at the same time, they can also create favorable conditions for certain national institutions to provide scientists with the tools necessary for their work (in countries where such conditions do not exist), guarantee their due social status, and attract a large proportion of young people to scientific activities.

    Dear friends, before ending my remarks, please allow me to pay special tribute to some of you.

    First of all, I would like to once again express my heartfelt thanks and deep respect to Professor Li Siguang, our association's vice chairman.

    I would also like to greet the two Chinese scientists who worked with me at the Executive Council in Paris in November 1946, Dr. Ye Zhubei, the representative of Dr. Tu Changwang, and Qian Sanqiang, a friend who spent many happy years with me in the French Academy laboratory.

    Today, two founders and inspirers of the association cannot be with you at the meeting, and I think you will all agree to express our gratitude to them. They are: Professor Bernal, our association's tireless and outstanding vice chairman, and Mr. Crowther, the association's former secretary-general who worked actively and enthusiastically during difficult years.

    Now, although I am far away from you, I feel that we are still very close. Indeed, our common love for science, our unwavering will to make science serve the welfare of mankind, has closely linked us together.

### 世界科学工作者协会主席约里奥—居里的贺信

    世界科学工作者协会主席约里奥—居里的贺信亲爱的朋友们：
    你们今天聚集在一起庆祝世界科学工作者协会成立十周年纪念，我迫切地希望同你们聚首，但是我实在不能作这个长途旅行。在写这封信的时候，我想你们都已经聚会在一起了，我希望能够把我的激动的心情全都用文字表达出来。
    世界科学工作者协会的创始人在1946年开会的时候，人类刚从一个可怕的梦魇中摆脱出来。
    当然，妄图在欧亚两洲建立“千年不朽”的迫害和蒙昧主义的丑恶独裁统治是已经消除了，可是这是付出了多大的代价才得来的呀！到处都遭到了破坏，到处都留下对千百万死者的回忆。
    在这次可怕的战争的最后时刻里，原子炸弹出现了。它的巨大破坏力，以及不顾我们许多美国同行有远见的警告而在广岛和长崎使用原子弹一下子就给人类提出了许多新的问题，而这个时候正是人们应该在建设和友爱的共同愿望中团结起来的时候。
    参加伦敦成立大会和巴黎执行理事会第一届会议的所有代表，以及他们所代表的科学家，都深深地感到今天科学的迅速发展和应用，将提出一些比以往更加困难的问题，凡是意识到自己的责任的科学家，对这些问题决不能漠不关心。
    当然，在我们中间，没有人不愿意把自己的全部精力用在科学上面，也没有人不愿全心全意地进行自己的研究工作而无需积极参加其他斗争。但是我们认为，要采取这种避重就轻的态度，是不可能的；而我们的看法是对了。
    我们大家一起采取的行动已经产生了效果。我们知道，某些情况的好转并不件件都是我们的功劳，但是在共同的工作里，我们毕竟尽了自己的一份责任。我在这里只举一个例子，而这个例子却是非常典型的。譬如，你们很多人都还记得，在世界科协成立的时候，那种保守秘密的气氛是多么沉重地影响着科学。在很长一段时期内，我们的主要斗争对象之一，就是反对保守秘密。
    在去年夏天日内瓦会议的时候，人们可以看到，为消除这种秘密而作的努力已经获得了多大的进展。
    在这方面，一切问题还远没有全都获得解决。我们参加这次日内瓦会议的观察员中间虽然有了一位中国科学家，我们虽然为此而感到高兴，但是，中国政府没有被邀请派遣正式代表参加，依然使我们不能不深感遗憾。
    十年来，我们一向坚持使我们的行动符合我们的组织规程，符合我们宪章的原则和序言的精神。今天再来看这些文件的时候，我不能不认为，它们完全是具有现实意义的。我相信，今后我们在科学方面和社会方面完成我们的任务时，这些文件仍然是我们必不可少的指南。
    在许多国家里，我们的协会还没有分会，或者，我们协会在那里的影响还不大。这是十年来严重的国际紧张局势所造成的后果，幸而这个局势今天已趋于缓和。因此我们的任务也许不是那么艰巨了，但是我们仍然必须把所有科学家团结起来。
    我们所受的教育，我们所用的研究方法，我们想要使它更加丰富的科学遗产所具有的世界性来源，所有这一切都使得科学工作者们有着一脉相通的联系，而我们也许还没有随时都充分意识到这种情况。
    现代武器之所以具有可怕的破坏力，显然说明科学是被滥用了，科学家们应该起来反对滥用科学。在这点上，科学家的职业使他们不仅是负担了所有国家公民所共有的责任，而且使他们负担了更多的责任。如果科学家不能及时把只有他们才能提供的科学根据公诸于世，他们又怎么能够责备自己的同胞在现代战争的巨大危险前面无动于衷呢？
    这个任务虽然是如此的重大，但是这还不过是我们的责任的一部分。仅仅为了使科学不被用来破坏而进行斗争是不够的，还应该为了立即利用人类进步的巨大可能性而进行斗争。在这方面，科学家们也应该发挥同等重要的作用。如果人们认识不到走向进步的可能性，那末他们怎么能够坚决地要求把科学适当地用来创造财富、消灭贫困、向疾病作斗争、并减轻各种劳动者的劳动强度呢？如果不是科学家自己，谁又能提供这样有效的材料呢？
    这是我们协会首先应该尽到的责任。
    此外，在使舆论注意到走向进步的可能性的时候，科学家们就能消除那种现在还很流行的说法，即科学主要是给人类带来可怕的破坏工具；同时，他们还能创造有利的条件，使某些国家机构供给科学家们工作上必需的工具（在没有这种条件的国家），保证他们应有的社会地位，并把很大一部分青年吸引到科学活动方面来。
    亲爱的朋友们，在结束我的话以前，请允许我特别向你们当中的几位朋友致意。
    首先，我要再一次向我们协会的副主席李四光教授表示我衷心的感谢和深切的敬意。
    我还要问候1946年11月在巴黎执行理事会上同我在一起工作的两位中国科学家，一位是涂长望博士的代表叶渚沛博士，另一位是在法兰西学院实验室里同我愉快地相处多年的朋友钱三强。
    今天，协会的两位创始人和鼓舞者不能同你们在一起开会，我想你们一定同意向他们表示我们的谢忱。他们就是：我们协会的不辞劳苦的和卓越的副主席贝尔纳教授和曾在艰难岁月里积极地和热诚地进行工作的协会前秘书长克劳瑟。
    现在，我虽然和你们离得很远，但是我感觉我们仍然是很接近的。的确，我们对科学的共同爱好，我们不屈不挠地使科学为人类福利服务的意志，已经把我们紧密地联系在一起了。
        1956年3月13日于可东尼
