    Xinhua News Agency, via TASS reports: On the afternoon of April 26th, Bulganin and Khrushchev flew from London to Edinburgh. Edinburgh is one of the oldest cities in Scotland and the historical capital of Scotland.
    After arriving in Edinburgh, the Soviet leaders visited places of interest and then drove to the City Council Building. Many citizens warmly welcomed them along the way. The Secretary of State for Scotland, Stuart, and the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Sir Banks, hosted a banquet for the Soviet leaders.
    At the banquet, Stuart delivered a welcoming speech to the Soviet guests. He said, "We are dining in an ancient Scottish fortress, but I am very pleased that this place no longer serves the purpose for which it was originally built." He said, "Khrushchev said at the banquet held at the Soviet Embassy in London: 'Peaceful coexistence based on trust will be our common goal.' This is also the sincere hope of our government and the Scottish people. We have had many beneficial contacts in the past. We hope that we can have many fruitful and friendly contacts in the future."
    Bulganin delivered a reply amidst warm applause from those present. He wished the residents of Edinburgh and all the people of Scotland success and prosperity. Bulganin said that he, like Stuart, was pleased that such fortresses were no longer needed. Bulganin raised a glass to the coexistence, friendship, and cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, and to the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet people and the Scottish people.
    After the banquet, Bulganin and Khrushchev flew back to London from Edinburgh.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: According to a TASS report from London on April 26th: On the morning of April 26th, Bulganin and Khrushchev laid a wreath at the tomb of Marx at Highgate Cemetery in London.

    After laying the wreath, the Soviet leaders and their entourage observed a minute of silence in memory of the great mentor.

    苏联领导人在英国的访问活动
    新华社据塔斯社讯  布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在四月二十六日下午从伦敦乘飞机前往爱丁堡。爱丁堡是苏格兰最古老的城市之一，是苏格兰历来的都城。
    苏联领导人抵达爱丁堡后参观了名胜古迹，然后乘汽车前往市议会大厦。沿途有许多市民热烈地欢迎他们。苏格兰事务大臣斯徒阿特和爱丁堡市长班克斯爵士设宴招待苏联领导人。
    在宴会上，斯徒阿特向苏联客人们致欢迎词。他说，我们进餐的地方是苏格兰一座古老的军事堡垒，但是我感到很高兴，现在这个地方不再具有当初建筑这个地方的目的了。他说，赫鲁晓夫在伦敦苏联大使馆举行的宴会上说：充满信任的共处将是我们共同的目的。我们的政府和苏格兰人民的真正希望也是如此。我们在过去曾经有过许多有益的接触。我们希望，我们将来也能够有许多有成效的和友好的接触。
    布尔加宁在到会者热烈欢迎下致答词。他祝爱丁堡的居民和全体苏格兰人民取得成就和繁荣。布尔加宁说，他和斯徒阿特同样地对现在已经不再需要这种堡垒这点感到愉快。布尔加宁举杯祝贺英国和苏联两国的共处、友谊和合作，祝贺苏联人民和苏格兰人民之间的友谊和合作。
    宴会结束后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫乘飞机离爱丁堡回伦敦。
    新华社27日讯  据塔斯社伦敦二十六日讯：四月二十六日晨，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫到伦敦海格特墓地的马克思墓前献花圈。用红玫瑰、白丁香和白色百合花编织的大花圈上写着：“献给伟大的思想家、科学的共产主义创始人卡尔·马克思，苏联政府和人民敬献”。
    在献花圈以后，苏联领导人和他们的随行人员为纪念这位伟大的导师默念一分钟。
