    The light industry sector has summarized 232 advanced experiences belonging to 23 industries including papermaking, rubber, medicine, sugar manufacturing, salt manufacturing, and match manufacturing. These are prepared for promotion at the National Light Industry Advanced Producer Representative Conference.
    Classified according to their main effects, seventy-two of these experiences improve product quality. Advanced experiences promoted in the rubber industry, such as the "segmented plastication method for raw rubber" and the "step-by-step heating and cooling demoulding vulcanization method," have greatly improved the physical and mechanical properties of automobile tires, increasing their mileage by more than double compared to 1952.
    Thirty-two advanced experiences for increasing labor productivity, after being promoted in industries such as papermaking and salt manufacturing, can greatly increase the output of these industries. If the advanced experience of rapid cooking from the Yingkou Paper Mill is universally promoted in the national papermaking industry, it can increase the production of 150,000 tons of pulp per year. Implementing the improved round net vat experience on round net paper machines across the country can also increase production by 25,000 tons of paper per year.
    The advanced experiences prepared for promotion in industries such as oils and fats, grain processing, and winemaking mainly relate to saving grain and increasing the extraction rate. For example, if the experience of "cold-pressed soybean imitation tofu" is promoted nationwide, it can increase soybean oil production by 30,000 to 40,000 tons per year, which is equivalent to saving soybeans from 50,000 mu of land. There are also twenty-four advanced experiences related to improving labor conditions and safe production. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    轻工业部门总结出许多先进经验
    属于造纸、橡胶、医药、制糖、制盐、火柴等二十三个行业的232项先进经验，已经由各有关部门总结出来，准备在全国轻工业先进生产者代表会议上推广。
    这些经验中，按其主要效果分类，提高产品质量的有七十二项。橡胶工业中推广的“生胶分段素炼法”、“逐步升温冷却启模硫化法”等先进经验，已经使目前汽车轮胎的物理机械性能大有提高，行驶里程比1952年提高了一倍以上。
    三十二项提高劳动生产率的先进经验，在造纸、制盐等行业中推广以后，可使这些行业的产量大大增加。营口造纸厂的快速蒸煮的先进经验，如果在全国造纸工业中普遍推广，一年可以增产十五万吨纸浆。改进圆网槽的经验在全国圆网抄纸机上推行，一年也可以增产两万五千吨纸。
    准备在油脂、粮食加工、制酒等行业中推广的先进经验，主要是属于节约粮食和提高出品率方面的。如“冷榨大豆复制豆腐”的经验在全国推广以后，一年可增产豆油三万到四万吨，等于节约五万亩地产的大豆。因此，还有二十四项是属于改善劳动条件、安全生产的先进经验。　（据新华社讯）
