    Cotton Seedlings Have Already Emerged in Southern Shanxi
    In the Jinan (Southern Shanxi) Special District of Shanxi Province, the sowing of 3.75 million mu of cotton fields has basically been completed. Cotton seedlings in Jieyu, Wanrong, and other places where sowing was done earlier have emerged one after another. Various agricultural production cooperatives have successively shifted to seedling protection and cotton seedling management work. In this year's cotton field sowing, the counties in Jinan generally studied and implemented the advanced experience of cotton high yield in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. More than 3,700 cadres in the district have been conducting technical training, training 570,000 technicians and technical backbones, so the sowing quality this year has been significantly improved. In order to eliminate diseases and insect pests, 45% of the cotton fields were treated with Ceresan for seed dressing, and the rest were generally treated with warm water soaking. At present, all localities are actively preparing pesticides and machinery to prevent the occurrence of cotton pests. (Guo Shi)

    晋南棉苗已经长出来了
    山西省晋南专区三百七十五万亩棉田，播种基本结束。播种较早的解虞、万荣等地棉苗已经陆续出土，各个农业生产合作社先后转入保苗及棉苗管理工作。今年棉田播种工作中，晋南各县普遍学习贯彻了新疆维吾尔自治区的棉花丰产先进经验，全区进行技术传授的干部有三千七百余人，传授了五十七万个技术员和技术骨干，因而今年播种质量显著提高。为了消灭病虫害，45％的棉田进行了赛力散拌种，其余也普遍进行了温汤浸种。目前各地正积极准备农药药械，防止棉花虫害发生。（郭石）
