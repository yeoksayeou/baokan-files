The first women's clothing store in Beijing opened for business on the 28th. This store is located in the bustling Dashilar area outside Qianmen.

Women entered the store with joyful hearts. They were busy selecting their favorite clothes. It was already lunchtime, but several young women were still trying on dresses in the fitting room to see which one was the most suitable, while a few young girls were wholeheartedly choosing another style of skirt. Some were looking at the style of women's coats, while others were choosing the colors of cheongsams. The store adopts an exhibition-style sales method, allowing customers to freely choose the clothes they are satisfied with. More than 500 items were sold on the 28th.

The store has seven fitting rooms and a processing factory. Three clothing design experts are designing new samples, and a technical research team dedicated to increasing new varieties is constantly collecting opinions, gathering information, and conducting research. Sewing workers and tailors hired from famous clothing stores in Shanghai have also started working.

    首都第一个妇女服装店
    二十八日，北京第一个妇女服装商店开始营业了，这个商店设在前门外热闹的大栅栏。
    妇女们都怀着喜悦的心情走进了这家商店。她们忙着选购称心的服装。已经到了吃午饭的时候了，几个年轻的妇女还在试衣间比比到底买那件连衣裙合适，而有几个少女却在一心一意地选购另外一种式样的裙子。有的在看女外衣的式样，有的又在选择旗袍的花色。这个商店是采取展览式的售货方法，让顾客可以自由地挑选满意的衣服。二十八日出售的商品共有五百多件。
    这个商店有七个试衣间和一个加工厂。三个服装设计专家正在设计新的样品，专门为增加新品种而工作的技术研究组，也在不断搜集意见，汇集资料，进行研究。从上海有名的服装商店聘来的缝纫工人和剪裁师也开始了工作。
