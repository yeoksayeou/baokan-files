The World Federation of Scientific Workers is holding its 16th Executive Council meeting in Beijing from April 1st, and a celebration meeting for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Scientific Workers was held on the 3rd. The holding of this council meeting and celebration meeting in Beijing, our capital, is a great encouragement to the Chinese people and scientific workers who are working hard for peaceful construction and vigorously developing science. We sincerely congratulate the meeting on its complete success and extend a warm welcome and respect to our friends who have come from afar.

The World Federation of Scientific Workers is the only mass international organization of scientific workers. Its goals are to strive for science to fully serve human happiness, promote international scientific cooperation, and protect the rights of scientific workers. In the ten years since its establishment in 1946, the World Federation of Scientific Workers has united more and more scientific workers to make unremitting efforts to safeguard the noble goals of science and has achieved remarkable achievements. The "Charter for Scientific Workers" adopted by its first congress clearly stipulates that opposing the misuse of scientific achievements for war preparations is the solemn responsibility of scientific workers to the world. The constitution of the World Federation of Scientific Workers also points out that only in an era of peace and international cooperation can science be fully used to improve human life. Based on this proposition, the successive congresses and executive councils of the World Federation of Scientific Workers have firmly declared their opposition to the use of atomic weapons and the policy of arms expansion and war preparation. The Executive Council of the World Federation of Scientific Workers has also taken many concrete measures to promote international scientific cooperation, safeguard academic freedom, and protect the human rights of scientific workers. The outstanding activities of the World Federation of Scientific Workers over the past ten years are fully in line with the interests and wishes of honest scientific workers in all countries, and therefore have won the support of more and more scientific workers around the world. Today, the World Federation of Scientific Workers has developed into an important international organization with 150,000 scientific workers as members and has become an important force in defending and developing science to serve peace and human happiness.

The 16th Executive Council meeting of the World Federation of Scientific Workers paid special attention to the dangers of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons to mankind. It issued a solemn statement calling on the United Nations Disarmament Committee to strive to reach an agreement on outstanding issues so that mankind can be freed from the threat of mass destruction. The statement called for the immediate conclusion of an international convention prohibiting atomic and thermonuclear weapons tests; at the same time, the statement also called on scientists around the world to more resolutely oppose the continued production, stockpiling, and testing of these destructive weapons. All this is entirely correct and timely. In order to further realize this goal, the meeting also decided to actively prepare for the holding of an international scientific conference so that authoritative scientists from various countries with different views can use their scientific knowledge to more forcefully expose the harm of atomic and thermonuclear weapons to mankind. As everyone knows, the discovery and application of atomic energy are the greatest achievements of modern science and the crystallization of human wisdom, and only world scientists who are familiar with the mysteries of nature can deeply and correctly estimate the power of atomic energy. Therefore, scientists have a special responsibility in the struggle against the use of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons. It can be predicted that an international scientific conference will enable people of all countries to further recognize the great harm of these weapons to human security, thereby promoting their struggle to strengthen the prohibition of the use and testing of these weapons and to strive for the peaceful use of atomic energy. In order to expand the organization of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, the meeting decided to establish new regional centers in addition to the World Federation of Scientific Workers regional centers in London and Paris, which will play a major role in the friendly cooperation of scientists from various countries. The resolutions made by the 16th Executive Council meeting of the World Federation of Scientific Workers are fully in line with the world peace and the vital interests of all scientific workers. The Chinese people and Chinese scientific workers firmly support these resolutions and are willing to fight for their implementation.

Chinese scientific workers have always supported the purpose and goals of the World Federation of Scientific Workers and have actively responded to and participated in the activities led by it. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the spirit of the "Charter for Scientific Workers" has been realized in our country. Chinese scientific workers have received high attention and deep concern from the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and they are making full use of their knowledge to serve the people. In recent years, Chinese scientific workers have actively participated in the struggle to defend world peace and oppose atomic weapons. With the rapid development of national construction, China's scientific undertakings have also made certain achievements, and the ranks of scientific workers are rapidly growing. However, since China's original scientific level was very backward, the current scientific work is far from meeting the requirements of production and construction. Scientific workers across the country urgently need to further unleash their potential, work hard on research, and diligently study the world's advanced scientific achievements. In recent years, the friendly cooperation between Chinese scientific workers and scientific workers from various countries has been greatly developed. Since the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies is one of the member organizations of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, this has created good conditions for Chinese scientific workers to learn from advanced scientists from various countries. The famous scientists from various countries who participated in the meeting made various important scientific reports to Chinese scientific workers and provided many valuable suggestions for China's scientific work. The Chinese people and Chinese scientific workers would like to express their heartfelt gratitude to the famous scientists from various countries who participated in the meeting.

We warmly celebrate the glorious achievements of the World Federation of Scientific Workers over the past ten years and wish it greater development on the road to striving for science to serve human happiness.

    争取科学为人类幸福服务
    世界科学工作者协会从四月一日起在北京举行第十六届执行理事会，并于三日举行世界科协成立十周年庆祝大会。这次理事会和庆祝大会在我国首都北京举行，对于正在努力进行和平建设和大力发展科学的中国人民和科学工作者是很大的鼓舞。我们衷心地祝贺会议的圆满成功，并向远道而来的朋友们表示热烈的欢迎和敬意。
    世界科学工作者协会是科学工作者唯一的群众性的国际组织。它的目标是争取科学充分为人类幸福服务、促进科学的国际合作和保障科学工作者的权利。从1946年成立以来的十年中，世界科协团结了越来越多的科学工作者为维护科学的崇高目标而进行了不懈的努力，并获得了卓越的成就。它的第一次代表大会通过的“科学工作者宪章”明确地规定：反对妄用科学成果来进行战争准备，是科学工作者对世界的庄严责任。世界科学工作者协会的会章也指出：只有在和平和国际合作的时代，科学才能充分地用来改善人类生活。根据这一主张，世界科协的历届代表大会和执行理事会都坚定地申明反对使用原子武器、反对扩军备战政策。世界科协执行理事会还采取了许多具体措施来促进国际科学合作、维护学术自由和保障科学工作者的人权。世界科协十年来的卓越活动，完全符合一切国家正直的科学工作者的利益和愿望，因而获得全世界越来越多的科学工作者的拥护和支持。今天的世界科协已发展成为拥有十五万科学工作者为会员的重要的国际组织，并成为保卫和发展科学以服务于和平和人类幸福的重要力量。
    世界科协第十六届执行理事会特别注意到原子武器、热核子武器对人类的危害。它发表了庄严的声明，要求联合国裁军委员会努力就悬而未决的问题达成协议，使人类摆脱大规模毁灭的威胁。声明要求立即缔结一项国际公约禁止原子武器和热核子武器试验；同时声明还号召全世界科学家们更坚决地反对继续生产、储存和试验这种毁灭性的武器。这一切都是完全正确而适时的。为了进一步实现这一目的，会议还决定积极筹备举行国际科学会议，使各国具有不同见解的权威科学家们运用他们的科学知识更加有力地揭发原子武器和热核子武器对于人类的危害性。大家知道，原子能的发现和应用，是现代科学最大的成果和人类智慧的结晶，只有通晓自然界奥秘的世界科学家才能深刻地和正确地估量原子能的力量。因此，在反对使用原子武器和热核子武器的斗争中，科学家负有特殊的责任。可以预料，一个国际科学会议将使各国人民进一步认识这些武器对于人类安全的极大危害，从而推动他们加强禁止使用和试验这些武器和争取和平利用原子能的斗争。为了扩大世界科协的组织，会议决定除了在伦敦和巴黎的世界科协区域中心之外，还将设立新的区域中心，这对于各国科学家的友好合作将起重大的作用。世界科协第十六届执行理事会所作出的各项决议是完全符合于世界和平和一切科学工作者的切身利益的。中国人民和中国科学工作者坚决支持这些决议，并愿为它的贯彻实现而奋斗。
    中国科学工作者一贯支持世界科学工作者协会的宗旨和奋斗目标，并积极地响应和参加了它所领导的活动。中华人民共和国成立以来，“科学工作者宪章”的精神已在我国获得实现。中国科学工作者受到中国共产党和人民政府的高度重视和深切关怀，他们正在充分地利用自己的知识为人民服务。几年来，我国科学工作者积极地参加了保卫世界和平、反对原子武器的斗争。随着国家建设的迅速发展，我国科学事业也有了一定的成就，科学工作者的队伍正在迅速壮大。但由于我国原来的科学水平十分落后，目前的科学工作还远不能适应生产建设的要求。全国科学工作者迫切需要进一步发挥潜力，努力进行研究，刻苦地学习世界先进的科学成就。几年来，我国科学工作者同各国科学工作者的友好合作获得了很大的发展。由于中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会是世界科协的会员团体之一，这就为我国科学工作者向各国先进科学家学习创造了良好的条件。这次参加会议的各国著名科学家，向我国科学工作者作了各种重要的科学报告，并对我国的科学工作提供了许多宝贵的意见。中国人民和中国科学工作者愿意向参加会议的各国著名科学家表示衷心的感谢。
    我们热烈地庆贺世界科学工作者协会十年来的光辉成就，并祝它在争取科学为人类幸福服务的道路上得到更大的发展。
