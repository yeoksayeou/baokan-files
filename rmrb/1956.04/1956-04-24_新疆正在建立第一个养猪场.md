Xinjiang is Establishing its First Pig Farm
　　On the plains north of the Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County, Xinjiang's first state-owned pig farm is being established. This pig farm will initially raise one hundred sows and five fine-breed boars, with plans to breed more than one thousand piglets this year. At the same time, 380 dairy cows will be raised and 500 mu of feed crops will be planted.

　　Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County is Xinjiang's main pig-producing area. The Xibe people who live here have a long history and rich experience in operating pig-raising as a household sideline. As early as fifteen years ago, they began to cross Soviet large white pigs with local black pigs, improving the quality of the local pigs. Now, all the pigs they raise are improved white pigs, which have a high meat yield and reproductive rate, and are also highly resistant to disease. According to incomplete statistics, last year Xibe farmers sold more than 5,000 fat pigs to the state. (Xinjiang Daily Editorial Department)

    新疆正在建立第一个养猪场
    在察布查尔锡伯族自治县北部的平原上，正在建立新疆的第一个国营经济猪场。这个养猪场开始就要饲养一百头母猪和五头良种公猪，计划在今年内繁殖仔猪一千头以上。同时还要饲养三百八十头乳牛，种植五百亩饲料作物。
    察布查尔锡伯族自治县是新疆的主要产猪区。生活在这里的锡伯族人民，经营养猪的家庭副业历史悠久，经验丰富。早在十五年前，他们就开始将苏联的大猪和土种黑猪杂交，改良了土种猪的质量。现在他们所饲养的猪，已经全部是改良白猪，这种猪的出肉率和繁殖率很高，抵抗病害的能力也很强。据不完全统计，去年锡伯族农民卖给国家的肥猪在五千头以上。（新疆日报编辑部）
