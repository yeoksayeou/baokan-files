    Xinjiang Launches Large-Scale Agricultural Bumper Harvest Competition

    A large-scale agricultural bumper harvest competition is being launched extensively in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

    More than two hundred advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives in over thirty counties are participating in the yield increase competition proposed by the Wuxing Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Turpan County. Many areas in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and southern Xinjiang are launching regional agricultural bumper harvest chain competitions between counties and between cooperatives. In Suiding, Yining, Shule, Shufu, and fifteen other counties, over 700,000 mu of large-area bumper harvest fields are participating in the competition.

    The Production and Construction Corps Sows Seeds on Newly Reclaimed Farmland
    Xinhua News Agency Report: The agricultural production and construction corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has sown seeds on 300,000 mu of newly reclaimed farmland this spring at the nineteen newly built and renovated farms last year.

    The newly built farms that have been put into production include the East Farm and Central Farm of the Xiayedi Farm in the Manas River Basin Reclamation Area. The soldiers have already mechanically sown 34,000 mu of wheat and will also sow 13,000 mu of cotton and other crops. A number of old farms in the Manas River, Urumqi River, and Kaidu River Basin Reclamation Areas have expanded their cultivated areas after renovation, with nearly 200,000 mu put into production.

    The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps is also stepping up the construction of thirteen water conservancy projects. Upon completion, these projects can irrigate more than 800,000 mu of land.

    生产建设部队在新开垦的耕地上播种
    据新华社讯　大规模的农业大面积丰产竞赛，正在新疆维吾尔自治区内深入展开。
    三十多个县的二百多个高级农业生产合作社参加了吐鲁番县五星高级农业生产合作社提出的增产竞赛。伊犁哈萨克族自治州和南疆地区的许多地方都展开了县与县、社与社的地区性农业大面积丰产连环竞赛。绥定、伊宁、疏勒、疏附等十五个县参加竞赛的有七十多万亩大面积丰产田。
    据新华社讯　中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队去年新建和改建的十九个农场，今年春天已经在三十万亩新开垦的耕地上播种。
    投入生产的新建农场有玛纳斯河流域垦区下野地农场的东场和中场。战士们已经用机械播种了三万四千亩小麦，还要播种棉花一万三千亩和其他作物。在玛纳斯河、乌鲁木齐河、开都河流域垦区的一批旧有农场，经过改建之后扩大了耕地面积，其中有近二十万亩投入了生产。
    新疆军区生产建设部队还正在加紧修建十三项水利工程。这些工程完成后可灌溉八十多万亩土地。
