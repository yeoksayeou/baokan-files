    To help a group of on-the-job cadres, workers, and demobilized construction soldiers who are applying for college this year, the Dalian City has established a refresher school, which opened on the 7th. From that day on, the students can spend half a workday at this school to brush up on relevant high school courses.

    This refresher school helps students review their lessons according to their college application preferences, dividing them into two classes. More than a dozen middle school teachers serve as teachers in the refresher school. They have compiled teaching syllabuses based on the 1956 college entrance examination syllabus for the teaching subjects. Leaders of various government offices, factories, and enterprises have stipulated that students participating in the refresher courses only work half a day. Staff members of enterprises such as the Dalian Aquatic Products Company have also switched work schedules with those preparing to apply for college, and some even share their work, giving them more time to review.

    帮助投考高等学校的在职干部等补习功课
    旅大市为一批今年投考高等学校的在职干部、职工和复员建设军人等举办的补习学校在七日开学，从这天起，学员们每天可以有半个工作日的时间在这个学校里补习高中的有关课程。
    这所补习学校根据学员的投考志愿，分两个班帮助学员温习功课。十几个中学教师兼任补习学校的教师，他们根据教学科目参考了1956年高等学校招生考试大纲编写了教学大纲。各个机关、工厂、企业的领导方面都规定参加温课的学员只做半天工作，旅大水产公司等企业的工作人员还和准备投考高等学校的人调换工作时间，有的还分担他们的工作，使他们有更多的时间进行复习。
