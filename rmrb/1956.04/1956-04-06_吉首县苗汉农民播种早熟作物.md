    Miao and Han Farmers in Jishou County Plant Early-Maturing Crops
    Miao and Han farmers in Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, are actively planting early-maturing crops on the terraced slopes they have been digging.
    Early-maturing crops have always been the staple food for the Miao and Han people. However, in the past, digging the land for early-maturing crops was squeezed in with the tense spring plowing preparations, so every year they only temporarily dug some land to plant, and the yield per mu was very low. This year, 70% of the Miao and Han farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives. They are generally advancing the planting season, striving for two to three harvests a year, and plan to expand the planting of double-cropping early corn by 1,500 mu. They started digging the land as early as the Spring Festival, and assigned special personnel to be responsible for soaking and sprouting the seeds. Shi Shaoneng, a Miao corn-growing expert from the Zhuangjia Cooperative in Jibai Township, carried out double-cropping early corn sprouting on February 15th, using seedling beds for raising seedlings. On March 16th, when the seedlings were one inch tall, they were directly transplanted into the field. The mountainous area has cold weather and many animal pests. The Tuanjie Cooperative in Pingyang Township applied cow dung to the pits where early corn was planted and covered them with pine branches to keep them warm and prevent animals. Many agricultural cooperatives are also intercropping early millet in the spring-nurtured fields.
    At present, the county has planted nearly 5,000 mu of various early-maturing crops. These early-maturing crops can yield 500,000 jin of grain.

    吉首县苗汉农民播种早熟作物
    湘西苗族自治州吉首县的苗族和汉族农民正在挖过来的坡地上积极播种早熟作物。
    早熟作物历来是苗、汉农民的接新口粮。但是在过去，早熟作物的挖地播种和紧张的备耕挤在一起，每年只是临时忙挖些地播种，每亩地的产量很低。今年，70％的苗、汉农民参加了农业生产合作社，他们普遍提早播种季节，争取一年两熟到三熟，并且计划扩种双季早玉米一千五百亩。在春节那天就都开始了挖地，并且由专人负责浸种催芽，吉白乡庄稼社的种玉米能手苗族石绍能，在二月十五日就进行了双季早苞谷催芽，采用苗床育秧，到三月十六日秧子有一寸多时就直栽到地里了。山区天气冷兽害多，坪阳乡团结社在种早玉米的凹里上了牛粪，外盖上松枝，以便保温和防兽。许多农业合作社还在春养地里夹种上早谷子。
    现在，全县已经播种各种早熟作物近五千亩。这些早熟作物可收获粮食五十万斤。
