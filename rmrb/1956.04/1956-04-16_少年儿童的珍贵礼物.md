    A precious gift for children
    On the 15th, members of the Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing received a double-wheeled double-furrow plow from the children of Yucai Primary School in Beijing. This was purchased with their savings from pocket money.
    At eight o'clock in the morning, more than 500 children from this school, holding high the bright red Young Pioneer flags, walked along the moat to the Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative and presented a double-wheeled double-furrow plow inscribed with "Yucai Pioneer" to the deputy director of the cooperative. Then, Deputy Director Huo Wenhai expressed his gratitude for the precious gift from the children and led the young guests on a tour of the cooperative's greenhouse and hotbeds.
    The faculty and staff of the school, together with the children, also presented another double-wheeled double-furrow plow to the agricultural production cooperative. (Xinhua News Agency)

    少年儿童的珍贵礼物
    十五日，北京郊区红旗农业生产合作社的社员们接受了北京的育才小学少年儿童送来的一部双轮双铧犁。这是他们用节约下来的零用钱购买的。
    清晨八点钟，这个学校的五百多名少年儿童，举着鲜红的少年先锋队队旗，沿着护城河步行到红旗农业生产合作社，把一部写有“育才少年号”的双轮双铧犁送给了这个合作社的副主任。接着副主任霍文海对少年儿童的珍贵赠礼表示感谢，并且带领小客人们参观了社里的温室、阳畦。
