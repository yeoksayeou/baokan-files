In the first quarter, state-owned factories in Shenyang saw more than 36,000 significant rationalization proposals from workers, of which more than 21,000 have been adopted and 10,062 have been organized and implemented. According to statistics on over 2,900 rationalization proposals that have been adopted and whose value can be calculated, they can directly create more than 3.9 million yuan for the country.

These rationalization proposals have played a significant role in completing current production tasks. For example, Li Enpu and Xia Yubo, workers at the forging workshop of the HuangguTtun Freight Car Repair Factory, and engineer Gao Lianke, converted the manually operated "wenzi" (clamps/tongs) on all electric and steam hammers to automatic operation, increasing the production capacity of the entire workshop by about 60%.

    大量采纳职工合理化建议
    沈阳各国营工厂在第一季度出现了较重要的合理化建议三万六千多件，其中已经被采纳的有二万一千多件，已经组织实现的有10，062件。据已经采纳并且能计算价值的二千九百多件合理化建议统计，可为国家直接创造三百九十多万元。
    这些合理化建议对当前完成生产任务起了很大作用。如皇姑屯货车修理工厂锻压车间工人李恩普、夏玉波和工程师高连科将全部电锤和汽锤上用手工操作的揾子改为自动化，使全车间生产能力提高了60％左右。
