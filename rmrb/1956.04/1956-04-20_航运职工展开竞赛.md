More than 80% of coastal and inland river shipping workers nationwide have joined the socialist competition.

The sailors navigating the seas and various inland rivers are making safe navigation and creating "advanced voyages" the main conditions of the competition. Now, many ships have become symbols of safe navigation. The "Peace No. 2" at sea has safely sailed 148,000 nautical miles. Captain Mo Jiarui, who regularly sails on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, has created a record of 250,000 kilometers of safe navigation.

This year, the loading and unloading efficiency of major ports has greatly improved. The stevedores of the Shanghai Port Authority have continuously created sixteen new records for improving loading and unloading efficiency from January to March this year.

Shipping workers have also made many significant inventions and creations in the competition. Navigation engineering personnel have recently successfully manufactured a detachable dredger. This dredger can be disassembled into eleven pieces and transported by truck to places without water transport. Therefore, it is estimated that the workload of dredging in the national navigation engineering field this year can increase by 42%. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    航运职工展开竞赛
    全国80％以上沿海和内河航运职工参加了社会主义竞赛。
    航行在海上和各内河的船员们都把安全航行和创造“先进航次”作为竞赛的主要条件。现在，已经有许多轮船成为安全航行方面的旗帜。海上的“和平二号”已经安全航行十四万八千浬。经常航行在长江上游的船长莫家瑞，创造了安全航行二十五万公里的纪录。
    今年各大港口的装卸效率都有很大提高。上海港务管理局的装卸工人，从今年一月到三月连续创造了十六项提高装卸效率的新纪录。
    航运职工们在竞赛中，还有许多重大的发明创造。航务工程人员最近也把一种能拆卸的挖泥船制造成功了。这种挖泥船可以拆卸成十一块，用大车运到不通水运的地方去。因此今年全国航务工程方面挖泥的工作量预计可以增加42％。（据新华社讯）
