    Safety Education for New Workers

    The state-owned Nanjing Machine Tool Plant experienced a relatively high number of personal injuries in the first quarter of last year due to new workers lacking knowledge of safe production practices. This year, the plant established a three-tier education system for new workers upon entry, with the Safety Technology Section, workshops, and work sections each providing safety production knowledge education, pointing out various dangerous areas, and introducing the lessons learned from past accidents. When new workers participate in production, the work section leader designates experienced master workers to be responsible for ongoing safety education. Simultaneously, new worker safety education cards have been created to review the extent to which they have received safety education.

    Since strengthening safety education for new workers, only one of the hundreds of new workers who entered the plant this year has suffered a minor finger injury. The plant has essentially eliminated personal injuries.

    In the high tide of industrial production, strengthening safety production education for new workers is extremely necessary. The experience of the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant in providing safety education for new workers is worthy of attention and promotion by factories and mines across the country.

    对新工人进行安全教育
    国营南京机床厂，去年第一季度，由于新工人缺乏安全生产知识，发生人身事故的情况比较严重。今年，这个厂建立了对新工人入厂三级教育制，由安全技术科、车间、工段分别进行安全生产知识的教育，指出各种危险场所和介绍历次事故的教训。在新工人参加生产的时候，又由工段长指定老师傅负责进行经常的安全教育；同时制定了新工人安全教育卡片，以便审查他们接受安全教育的程度。
    自从对新工人加强安全教育以来，今年进厂的几百名新工人，只有一个人的指头上碰破了皮。这个厂已经基本上消灭了人身事故。
    在工业生产高潮中，对新工人加强安全生产教育是非常必要的。南京机床厂对新工人进行安全教育的经验，值得各地厂矿重视和推广。
