Xinhua News Agency Report

Agricultural technology extension stations in rural areas across the country have launched extensive agricultural technology dissemination activities in the spring plowing season. According to statistics from some special districts and counties in Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi provinces, more than 2.2 million agricultural technicians have been trained for agricultural production cooperatives by the end of March. After short-term training, these agricultural technicians generally master techniques such as seed selection, seed drying, seed dressing with chemicals, germination tests, and close planting to protect seedlings, as well as the techniques for using and repairing double-wheeled double-shared plows and seeders.

Currently, agricultural technology extension stations in the southern provinces are widely guiding farmers in sowing early spring crops, preparing new-style seedling fields, square-grid cotton seedling cultivation, and early spring vegetable planting. Agricultural technology extension stations in the North China provinces have also begun to guide the masses in digging up fertilizer sources, high-temperature and fire-temperature composting, carrying out sweet potato warm bed seedling cultivation, and inspecting seed germination and winter and spring field management.

    各地技术推广站在春耕中广泛传授农业技术
    全国农村的农业技术推广站在春耕中已经开展了广泛的农业技术传授活动。据江苏、河南、河北、山东、湖南、四川、陕西等省部分专区和县的统计，到三月底已经为各地的农业生产合作社训练了二百二十多万名农业技术员。这些农业技术员经过短期训练，一般都能掌握了一项选种、晒种、药剂拌种、发芽试验、密植保苗等技术和使用、修理双轮双铧犁、播种机的技术。
    目前，南方各省的农业技术推广站正广泛地指导农民进行播种早春作物、准备新式秧田、棉花方格育苗和早春蔬菜种植等工作。华北各省的农业技术推广站，也都开始指导各地群众进行挖掘肥源和高温、火温沤肥、开展甘薯温床育苗以及检查种子发芽情况和冬、春田间管理等工作。
