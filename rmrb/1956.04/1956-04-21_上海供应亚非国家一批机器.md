Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th—This reporter learned from the Shanghai Branch of the China National Import and Export Corporation and other sources on the 19th: In the past six months, they have supplied more than 50 machines to Burma, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Singapore, and other places. These machines include knitting machines, cigarette machines, diesel generators, DC welders, universal grinders, and shapers. At present, merchants from Indonesia, Egypt, Thailand, Syria, and other Asian and African countries are contacting them to purchase other machines.

Dozens of factories in Shanghai are currently manufacturing or preparing to manufacture machinery and equipment for Asian and African countries. Among them, the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory and the joint state-private China Textile Machinery Factory have received the most orders. They are manufacturing spinning frames and looms for Burma and other countries. According to the directors of these two factories, special attention is paid to the quality of the production of these machines. For example, the most important part of the spinning frame—the spindle—will be manufactured using ball bearing alloy steel produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

    上海供应亚非国家一批机器
    据新华社上海20日电  本社记者十九日从中国进出口公司上海分公司等方面获悉：最近六个月，他们供应了缅甸、越南民主共和国和新加坡等地五十多部机器。这些机器中有针织机、卷烟机、柴油发电机、直流电焊机、万能磨床和牛头刨床等。现在，亚非地区的印度尼西亚、埃及、泰国和叙利亚等国的商户正在向他们接洽采购其他机器。
    上海目前有几十个工厂正在或准备为亚非地区国家制造机器装备。其中接到订货最多的是国营上海第二纺织机械厂和公私合营中国纺织机械厂，他们是为缅甸等国制造细纱机和织布机。据这两个工厂的厂长谈，生产这些机器都特别注意质量，如细纱机上最重要的零件——锭子，将用鞍山钢铁公司出产的滚珠合金钢制造。
