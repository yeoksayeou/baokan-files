Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. The State Council issued a directive on April 3rd regarding guaranteeing the completion of this year's higher education enrollment plan.

The directive stated that the 1956 higher education enrollment task has been expanded by 40,000 students compared to the target set in the First Five-Year Plan, with the number of students to be enrolled reaching over 170,000 (including preparatory students for study in the Soviet Union, etc.). However, this year there are only slightly more than 156,000 senior high school graduates. After deducting those who will move elsewhere, it is estimated that only around 140,000 will be able to apply for higher education, far from meeting the enrollment needs of higher education institutions. In order to guarantee the successful completion of this year's higher education enrollment task, it is necessary to maximize the potential sources of applicants. In addition to mobilizing all of this year's senior high school graduates to apply for higher education, we should also widely mobilize cadres currently working in government offices, primary school teachers, graduates of secondary normal schools this year, demobilized construction soldiers, transferred military personnel, employees of joint state-private enterprises, educated youth from industrial and commercial circles, educated youth waiting for employment, and systematically select in-service mid-level professional cadres and graduates of secondary vocational schools this year to apply for higher education. Moreover, we should actively help them catch up on their studies as soon as possible, improve their academic level, and do a good job in conducting political reviews and physical examinations to ensure the quantity and quality of newly admitted students.

The State Council stipulated in the directive that the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality should mobilize all of this year's senior high school graduates to apply for higher education. Unless they fail the entrance examination, they must not be retained for other purposes, and even more so, students who have not graduated must not be transferred for other uses midway. Relevant functional departments should select one-tenth of the graduates of their affiliated secondary vocational schools to take the entrance examination for higher education institutions. State organs, institutions, and enterprises at all levels should widely mobilize in-service cadres (including professional cadres in the financial and economic and agricultural systems, but excluding professional cadres in factories and mines and the health system affiliated with central departments) to apply for higher education institutions. All in-service cadres who meet the application conditions can apply as long as they are willing to do so. All units should actively support them, provide them with enthusiastic help, and must not obstruct them in any way or under any pretext. Industrial and transportation departments should select mid-level industrial professional cadres with secondary vocational school degrees or equivalent qualifications from their affiliated factories, mines, and enterprises to apply for higher education institutions. The major they apply for should be the same as or similar to the work they are doing, and after graduation, they should still return to the original sponsoring department for job assignments. As long as they are willing, primary school teachers and graduates of secondary normal schools this year can apply for higher normal schools. The People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality should instruct relevant departments to mobilize employees of joint state-private enterprises, educated youth from industrial and commercial circles, and educated youth waiting for employment to apply for higher education institutions. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army should be responsible for mobilizing demobilized construction soldiers and transferred military personnel to apply for higher education institutions. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission should mobilize returned overseas Chinese students and students from Hong Kong and Macau to apply for higher education institutions.

The directive stated that the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League have stipulated specific measures to help young people preparing to apply for higher education institutions to catch up on their studies, and all localities should earnestly implement these measures and do a good job in this regard. Working units should provide in-service personnel preparing to apply for higher education institutions with various conveniences for catching up on their studies. The most important thing is to guarantee the necessary time; they should at least be partially relieved from their work to review and prepare for the examination. In-service cadres from government organs, in-service mid-level professional cadres, primary school teachers, and employees and workers from joint state-private enterprises who have participated in revolutionary work for three years or more or have three or more years of work experience can enjoy the same treatment as cadres transferred from work or industrial worker students, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education. Other young people who apply and are admitted may apply for general student financial aid if they have real economic difficulties. In-service cadres from government organs, in-service professional cadres, primary school teachers, employees of joint state-private enterprises, etc., who are not admitted should return to their original units to work. The original units must not discriminate against them, and even more so, it is not allowed to refuse to take care of them.

    国务院发布关于保证完成今年高等学校招生计划的指示
    新华社4日讯　国务院在四月三日发布关于保证完成今年高等学校招生计划的指示。
    指示说，1956年高等学校招生任务，比第一个五年计划规定的任务扩大了四万人，招生人数达到十七万多人（包括应招的留苏预备生等）。但是今年高中毕业生仅有十五万六千多人，扣除流动数以后，估计能报考高等学校的不过十四万人左右，远不敷高等学校招生的需要。为了保证今年高等学校招生任务的胜利完成，必须尽最大可能扩大报考学生的来源。除了应该动员今年的高中毕业生全部报考高等学校以外，还应该广泛地动员机关在职干部、小学教师、中等师范学校今年的毕业生、复员建设军人、转业军人、公私合营企业职工、工商界知识青年、停学待业知识青年和有计划地抽调在职的中级专业干部、中等专业学校今年的毕业生报考高等学校。而且，应该积极地帮助他们及早补习功课，提高他们的学业水平，做好对他们进行政治审查和体格检查的工作，以保证录取新生的数量和质量。
    国务院在指示中规定：各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会应该动员今年的高中毕业生全部报考高等学校，除非经过考试未被录取，不得留作他用，更不能将未毕业学生中途调作别用。各有关业务部门应该从所属中等专业学校今年的毕业生中选送十分之一的人数，考入高等学校。各级国家机关、事业和企业单位应该广泛动员在职干部（包括财经、农业系统的专业干部，不包括中央各部门所属厂矿和卫生系统的专业干部），报考高等学校。凡是合乎报考条件的在职干部，只要本人自愿，就可以报考。各单位对他们应该积极支持，给以热情帮助，不得用任何方式和任何借口加以阻拦。各工业和交通运输部门应该从所属厂矿、企业单位中，抽调具有中等专业学校毕业或者相同程度的中级工业专业干部投考高等学校，报考的专业应该和他们所担任的工作相同或者相近，毕业以后仍返回原保送部门分配工作。对小学教师和中等师范学校今年的毕业生，只要本人自愿，就可以报考高等师范学校。各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会应该责成有关部门动员公私合营企业职工、工商界知识青年和停学待业知识青年报考高等学校。中国人民解放军总干部部应该负责动员复员建设军人、转业军人报考高等学校。华侨事务委员会应该动员归国华侨学生和港澳学生报考高等学校。
    指示说，高等教育部、教育部、青年团中央对于帮助报考青年补习功课，已经规定了具体办法，各地应该切实执行，做好这一工作。对于准备报考的在职人员，所在工作单位应该给以补习功课的各种便利，最重要的是保证必要的时间，至少应该使他们半脱离工作，进行温课备考。录取入学的机关在职干部、在职的中级专业干部、小学教师、公私合营企业的职员和工人，凡是参加革命工作满三年或者有三年以上工龄的，都可以根据高等教育部的规定享受调干学生助学金或产业工人助学金的待遇。其他报考青年录取入学以后，如果经济确实困难，可以申请一般学生助学金。没有被录取的机关在职干部、在职专业干部，小学教师、公私合营企业职工等，一律回原单位工作，原单位不得歧视，更不容许拒绝不管。
