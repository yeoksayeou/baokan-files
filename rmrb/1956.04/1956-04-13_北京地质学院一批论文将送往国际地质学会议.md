    Will be Sent to the International Geological Congress

Beijing College of Geology recently selected twenty-two scientific papers to be sent to the 20th International Geological Congress to be held in Mexico.

Seven professors, one associate professor, three lecturers, two teaching assistants, and seven graduate students wrote these papers. Professor Wang Hongzhen, director of the Geohistory Teaching and Research Section, wrote three papers, including "On the Sinian System" and "The Proterozoic Fold Belt in Eastern China." The papers comprehensively explore the division of certain strata in China and their comparison with those in other parts of the world. Professor Feng Jinglan of the Ore Deposit Teaching and Research Section, in his article "Modern Dynamic Geology of the Yellow River Basin," provides a detailed discussion of the geological conditions of the Yellow River Basin, which has practical significance for the Yellow River water conservancy planning. Seven young people, including graduate students Chen Ming and Yang Chengtian of the Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology Teaching and Research Section, discussed the hydrogeological conditions of farmland irrigation and mining areas in Liaoning, the Songhua River Basin, and Fuzhou Bay in China. Their papers were praised by the famous Soviet hydrogeologist Professor Krylov.
