Construction in the Great Khingan Forest Area has begun this year. In early April, six projects, including bridges, power transmission lines, and houses, have already started construction in the mountains, more than a month earlier than in previous years.

This year, a tannin extract factory using pine bark to manufacture leather materials will begin construction in the Great Khingan Mountains. The medium-sized machinery repair factory, which began construction last year, will complete its machinery installation this year and go into production. In addition, new and extended forest railway lines, timber transportation roads, and telephone lines will be built. A central hospital for the forest area and a large number of residential buildings will also be completed this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
