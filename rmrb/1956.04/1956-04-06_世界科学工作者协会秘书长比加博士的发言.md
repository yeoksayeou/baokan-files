Speech by Dr. Beega, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, at the Tenth Anniversary Commemorative Meeting of the World Federation of Scientific Workers

Mr. Chairman, dear friends,

Today we are here to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Scientific Workers. This provides us with an opportunity to review our past work and draw lessons from it that we must follow in our future work.

I would like to first point out how happy all the members of the Executive Council of the Association are to be holding this anniversary in the beautiful capital of the People's Republic of China.

It is easy to list a whole series of reasons to explain such a sentiment; I would just like to point out first that the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies is one of the founders of the World Federation of Scientific Workers; secondly, it is difficult to find a country more suitable than China to gather on such an occasion; here, people feel how necessary it is to use all methods of modern science and technology; here people are convinced that from now on, there are all conditions to guarantee the full development and full utilization of science.

As the Secretary-General of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, speaking on such a moving occasion, I must also immediately point out how sorry we are that our friend Crowther cannot come to participate due to matters in London. Crowther has served as our Secretary-General since the establishment of the Association, completing tremendous work during difficult times, enabling us to gather here today. We all extend our gratitude and friendly greetings to him.

1946! At that time, mankind had just emerged from the terrifying years of World War II, just emerged from the heavy destruction of human life and material wealth. It was at that time that the Association of Scientific Workers in Britain and the Federation of Scientific Workers in France and England put forward the idea of establishing an international organization of scientific workers. In February and July 1946, two meetings were held in London successively, at which the basic principles and organizational regulations of our association were drafted. In November 1946, the Executive Committee met in Paris. At that time, eighteen different organizations participated in the association. Almost all of them are still members of the association today. Some organizations no longer exist, either due to merging with other organizations or due to measures taken by certain governments. Some organizations have withdrawn from the association, which is also one of the phenomena of our association being affected by international tensions, fortunately, international tensions are now easing.

In 1951, a new organization from France joined the association;
In 1952, organizations from Poland, the Soviet Union, and Hungary joined the association;
In 1953, the Pakistan Science Association joined the association;
In 1954, scientific workers from the German Democratic Republic and Japan joined the association;
The day before yesterday, we were very pleased to welcome our colleagues from Albania, North Korea, Mongolia, and Romania.

The World Federation of Scientific Workers now has representatives from eighteen countries, with more than 150,000 members. It is the only global organization of scientists from various countries today, in which they have the opportunity to gather and discuss all issues related to them.

The goals that the association established from its inception, and will continue to guide its actions for a long time, are very broad. We have tried our best to work in the established direction in the past, and we have also realized how tremendous the work that remains for us to do is. Therefore, we should continuously strive to add new forces to our organization to strengthen and enrich our work. Therefore, we are particularly pleased to come to China to feel the atmosphere of enthusiasm for work and realistic hope that can be found everywhere here, and the conference held here is a new and powerful proof of this atmosphere. We are deeply convinced that we will receive strong encouragement to continue to implement our line of work.

According to our constitution, we want to: promote the full utilization of science for peace and the good life of mankind.

In order to promote international scientific cooperation, encourage the exchange of scientific knowledge and scientific personnel, safeguard the freedom of scientific work and the coordination of scientific work at the national and international levels, disseminate the results of scientific work, improve the conditions of scientific education, and improve the conditions of scientific work and the social status of scientific workers, the association has fully utilized all its methods. At the time of its founding, our methods were not great, now they are more, and we will do our best to make our future methods even greater.

In these ten years, we have strived to promote contact between scientists from various countries, especially through the establishment of vacation stations and individual and group visits.

At solemn ceremonies held in London and Paris in 1947, we commemorated two great scientists: Langevin and Lord Rutherford. At the latter ceremony, we organized an international scientific discussion meeting. I think the association should think of ways to promote this excellent method. This method can not only allow us to recall the scientific work of great scientists, but also examine the extent to which the research work started by them has developed today.

Our gazette, published in English, Chinese, French, and recently in German, serves as a liaison and mutual notification organ for all scientific organizations in the association. Our journal "Science and Humanity," which previously only had two issues, will meet with you in a new form, while two internal scientific information publications are being published in London and Prague.

In a world where people still have lingering fears of World War II, and the rapid development of science and technology raises new questions every day, the World Federation of Scientific Workers inevitably had to express its position. The preamble to our constitution states:

"Scientific workers can no longer passively tolerate the abuse of science... Science can only fully serve progress in an era of peace and international cooperation: therefore, compared to ordinary citizens, scientists have a greater responsibility for maintaining stable political relations between countries."

In its work, the association has always paid attention to respecting the independence of national science associations as much as possible, and only in the lines stipulated in the constitution and the "Charter of Scientific Workers," and in the various resolutions of the General Assembly and the Executive Council, does it publicly express our attitude.

The association had to carry out some work to oppose the strict secrecy in science, and to oppose the persecution of some of our branches and scientific workers due to political opinions - and often the most outstanding scientists were persecuted.

Our world unfortunately entered the atomic age under the circumstances that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were successively destroyed. In this world, the World Federation of Scientific Workers faces the issue of weapons of mass destruction, and has inevitably been, and still is, in a ridiculous situation.

On the issue of the use of nuclear weapons, germ weapons (the Executive Council spent part of its time discussing these two weapons in 1951) and thermonuclear weapons, the association has never ceased to fight against the abuse of science.

The association has issued appeals to all scientists, the United Nations Organization, and world public opinion. The association has unremittingly strived to prepare to respond to all initiatives to promote the convening of international scientific conferences. At this meeting, qualified scientists from various countries with different opinions can clearly and indisputably point out the dangers that the use of weapons of mass destruction will bring to mankind, and at the same time point out the dangers that the testing of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons brings to mankind now. We are deeply convinced that if world public opinion understands these, and no one can doubt that someone is harboring political motives and deliberately distorting the enumeration of various threats and dangers, then it will demand that all necessary measures be taken internationally to prevent this terrible disaster. We know that firm and united public opinion cannot be resisted by any force.

Opposing science being used for destruction is the primary task of all scientists who are aware of their responsibilities. When scientists are conducting this struggle, conducting propaganda to their compatriots, and providing their compatriots with scientific bases that only they can provide, they will at the same time oppose that dangerous skepticism (it should be said pessimism). When people only see the picture of disasters caused by the abuse of science, many people are often captured by that idea. In this way, scientists also protect the science they love so much, the science to which they have contributed most of their lives, so that it will not be subjected to undue distrust and aversion.

But this is not the only task that falls on their heads. If it is a basic task to prevent science from being used for destruction, and an important task to prevent weapons of mass destruction from being used to threaten the freedom of the peoples of all countries, then it is equally important to enable all mankind to immediately utilize the broad prospects unfolded by science and technology. There is no need to think about those more or less bold predictions to discover these prospects. The question is not what mankind may do after traveling to the moon... or to celestial bodies farther away from the earth, but what can be realized immediately based on the conditions and research results we have already mastered.

The reasons why the use of scientific discoveries and technological possibilities to liberate mankind from arduous work and create a happy life for mankind is still so inadequate - especially so unbalanced - are many. Studying these reasons, and judging the various organizational forms of human society based on this study, may lead to various different conclusions. In an institution like ours, opinions should not be expressed on this point. But scientists should not therefore be indifferent to the way in which society utilizes the results of their research. Through mutual notification, through the popularization of scientific achievements, and through participation in the work of institutions responsible for planning and organizing production, they will create trust in science in society, create a will to develop science for the benefit of all members of society, and in turn, they will obtain the necessary information for conducting research from such an awakened society.

When we strive to create the best conditions for the development and promotion of science, we must never forget: it is absolutely important to recruit people who are enthusiastic about scientific activities in society, educate them, and provide them with the necessary information. In many, many countries, scientific workers are only cultivated from certain privileged classes in society. For the greatest benefit of the entire population, no one who can contribute to the edifice of science should be hindered.

Among human activities, there are few activities as obviously wrong as the arms race and war preparations. Just a slight look at the huge amounts of money used in the budgets of various countries for the production of military arms and the maintenance of strong armies can show how much benefit it would bring to mankind if these wasted huge works were used for peaceful construction. At this moment, countries are so concerned about this issue, and scientists are naturally no exception. But they also have a special responsibility, that is, to clarify certain scientific and technological obstacles, and not allow them to be used again to advocate the fallacies that it is impossible to supervise disarmament and impossible to prohibit weapons of mass destruction.

Dear friends, when you think of a huge machine that can single-handedly perform the labor of a large group of people, or even when you use a rough tool that can reduce human labor, you must often feel the pride aroused by conquering the forces of nature.

This collective pride and arrogance have nothing in common. When scientific workers observe the never-ending road of development of science through their work, they often have such feelings. Paul Langevin described this development road as:

"A living connection between the past and the future; a torch of thought passed down from generation to generation, a flame that burns higher and higher."

We scientists should always remember that it is a great privilege to engage in a lovable and ever-innovating profession. However, the reason why we can inherit those who have pioneered and left us a valuable knowledge heritage before us is entirely due to all members of society, who in the past, and continue to complete their work to ensure human life in the present. Without them, our work would not be possible at all.

In order to repay all mankind, we should not neglect to enable all mankind to fully enjoy the fruits of the work accumulated by scientists of all generations. The same working methods and common goals can establish some common points between scientists from various countries, making them creators of international cooperation and friendship.

We should be responsible for maintaining the scientific heritage that we have received from our masters, and strive to enrich and pass on to future generations to all our compatriots. We hope that we can always be without shame to the people around us, who have the right to demand that we produce work results. We hope that we can engage in our beloved profession with the peace of mind of having completed our responsibilities. Therefore, we should ask ourselves every day: "Have you done your best to make science serve the happiness of mankind and contribute to the guarantee of peace?" We should always strive to work so that we can give an affirmative answer to the above question. Only then can we feel proud and happy in the great society of mankind.

### 世界科学工作者协会秘书长比加博士的发言

专栏：

    在世界科协成立十周年纪念大会上的发言
    世界科学工作者协会秘书长比加博士的发言主席先生，亲爱的朋友们，
    今天我们在这里纪念世界科学工作者协会成立十周年纪念。这给我们提供了一个机会，来回顾过去的工作，从而得出我们今后的工作必须遵循的经验教训。
    我想首先指出，这次周年纪念在中华人民共和国的美丽的首都举行，在这里参加协会执行理事会的全体成员是多么高兴。
    要举出一大串的理由来说明我们这样一种情绪，那是很容易的；我只想首先指出，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会是世界科学工作者协会的创办者之一；其次，我们很难找到一个比中国更合适的国家来在这样一个场合聚会；在这里，人们是多么感到有必要运用现代科学技术的一切方法；在这里人们深信从现在起，有一切条件保证科学的充分发展和充分利用。
    作为世界科协的秘书长，在这样一个令人感动的场合发言，我还要马上指出，我们的朋友克劳瑟，因为在伦敦有事不能前来参加，我们是多么感到遗憾。克劳瑟从协会成立时起就担任我们的秘书长，在困难的时期中完成了巨大的工作，从而使我们今天能够在这里聚会。我们全体向他致以感谢和友谊的贺意。
    1946年！那时人类刚刚摆脱世界大战的恐怖的岁月，刚刚摆脱对人的生命和物质财富的惨重破坏。正是在那时，英国科学工作者协会和法英科学工作者联会方面，出现了创立科学工作者的国际组织的主张。1946年2月和7月，先后在伦敦召开了两次会议，会上拟订了我们协会的基本原则和组织条例。1946年11月，执行委员会在巴黎举行。那时有十八个不同组织参加了协会。现在几乎全体都仍旧是本会的会员。有些组织或者由于合并到旁的组织，或者由于某些政府所采取的措施，现在已经不再存在。有些组织退出了协会，这也是我们协会受国际紧张局势影响的现象之一，幸而国际局势现在正趋于缓和。
    1951年，法国有一个新的组织参加本会；
    1952年，波兰、苏联、匈牙利的组织参加本会；
    1953年，巴基斯坦科协参加本会；
    1954年，德意志民主共和国和日本的科学工作者参加本会，
      前天，我们很愉快地欢迎我们的阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜、蒙古和罗马尼亚的同行们。
    世界科学工作者协会现在有十八个国家的代表，有十五万以上的会员。它是今日各国科学家唯一的世界性组织，在这个组织中他们有可能聚会，并且讨论与他们有关的一切问题。
    协会从一成立就规定下来的，并将长期继续指导它的行动的目标是非常广泛的。我们过去已经尽力遵循已定的方向进行工作，我们也体会到有待于我们做的工作是如何的巨大。因此，我们应该不断地努力，使新的力量加入我们的组织，来加强并丰富我们的工作。因此，我们特别高兴来到中国，来感受这里到处都可以发现的充满着工作热忱和现实的希望的气象，在这里召开的大会就是这种气氛的新的有力证明。深信我们一定会得到有力的鼓舞，以继续贯彻我们的工作路线。
    根据我们的章程，我们要：提倡为和平与人类美好生活而充分利用科学。
    为了提倡国际的科学合作，鼓励科学知识和科学人员的交流，维护科学工作的自由与科学工作在国内和国际范围的配合，传播科学工作的成果，改善科学教育的条件，改善科学工作的条件和科学工作者的社会地位，协会已经充分运用了它的一切办法。在创办的时候，我们的办法是不大的，现在已经更多一些，我们将竭尽全力，使我们将来的办法更多。
    在这十年当中，我们曾努力促进各国科学家的接触，特别是通过举办休假站，以及个别和集体访问的方式。
    在1947年分别在伦敦和巴黎举行的庄严的典礼上，我们曾纪念两位伟大的科学家：郎之万和鲁德福勋爵。在后面一次典礼上，我们曾组织过国际科学讨论会，我想协会应该想法发扬这种优良的方式。这种方式一面可以使我们追忆伟大科学家的科学工作，同时也可以考察一下由他开端的研究工作现在发展到什么程度。
    我们用英文、中文、法文和不久以前开始用德文出版的公报，为协会中全体科学团体起了联系和相互通报的机关报的作用。我们以前仅出了两期的期刊“科学与人类”，将以新的形式和大家见面，同时两种内部的科学情报刊物正在伦敦和布拉格出版。
    在人们对第二次世界大战犹有余悸，科学与技术的迅速发展每天都提出新问题的世界里，世界科学工作者协会不可避免地不得不表示它的立场。我们的章程的序言指出：
    “科学工作者不能再消极地容忍滥用科学……科学只有在和平与国际合作的时代里才能充分为进步服务：因而，比起普通的公民来，科学家对于保持各国间稳固的政治关系负有更大的责任。”
    协会在它的工作中，经常注意尽量尊重各国科协的独立性，只是在章程和“科学工作者宪章”所规定的路线中，在全体大会和执行理事会的各种决议中，才公开表示我们的态度。
    协会不得不进行一些工作，来反对在科学方面严守秘密，反对由于政治见解的关系，对我们的某些分会和科学工作者进行迫害——遭到迫害的而且时常是最卓越的科学家。
    我们的世界不幸在广岛和长崎先后被毁灭的情况下进入了原子时代，在这个世界里，世界科学工作者协会面临着大规模毁灭性武器的问题，不可避免地曾经处在并且现在仍旧处在啼笑皆非的状况中。
    在使用核子武器、细菌武器（1951年执行理事会曾以一部分时间讨论过这两种武器）和热核子武器的问题上，协会从未中止对科学的滥用进行斗争。
    协会曾向全体科学家，联合国组织和世界舆论发出呼吁。协会不懈地努力，准备响应一切创议，促使国际科学会议得以召开。在这个会上，具有各种不同见解的各国有资格的科学家们，可以明确地、不容置辩地指出大规模毁灭性武器的使用将使人类遭到的危险，同时指出原子武器和热核子武器试验的进行现在就给人类带来的危险。我们深信，如果世界舆论明了这些，而且谁也不能怀疑有人抱着政治目的，在列举各种威胁和危险时故意歪曲，那么它就会要求在国际范围内采取一切必需的措施，来防止这可怕的灾害。我们知道，坚决而一致的公众舆论是没有任何力量能够加以抗拒的。
    反对科学被用来进行破坏，这是一切意识到自己的责任的科学家的首要任务。科学家们在进行这个斗争，在向同胞们进行宣传，把只有他们才能提供的科学根据提供给同胞们的同时，就将同时反对了那种危险的怀疑主义（应该说是悲观主义）。当人们只看到滥用科学而引起的灾害的图景时，许多人常会被那种思想俘掳的。这样，科学家们同时也就保卫了他们如此热爱的科学，保卫了自己为之贡献出大部分生命的科学，使它不致遭到不应有的不信任和厌恶。
    但是这并不是落在他们头上的唯一任务。如果说使科学不被用来进行破坏是基本的任务，使大规模毁灭性武器不能用来威胁各国人民的自由是重要的任务，那么，使全体人类能立即利用科学与技术所展开的广阔远景也是同等重要的任务。用不着去想那些或多或少是大胆的预见，就可以发现这些远景。问题不在于人类到月球……或是到离地球更远的天体去旅行回来后可能做些什么，而是那些凭我们已经掌握的条件和研究成果，立即就可以实现的事情。
    利用科学的发现以及技术的可能性来把人类从费力的工作中解放出来，并且为人类创造一个愉快的生活，现在还是做得那么样不充分——尤其是那么样不平衡——其中的理由是很多的。研究这些原因，从这研究出发而对人类社会各种组织形式加以判断，可能得出各种不同的结论，在我们这样一个机构中，不应该就此点发表意见。但是对社会怎样利用科学家研究成果的方式，科学家却并不因此就可以漠不关心，通过相互的通报，通过科学成果的普及工作，通过参与负责规划和组织生产的机构的工作，他们将在社会中创造对科学的信任，创造一种使科学为社会全体成员的利益而发展的意志，反过来，他们也就将从这样觉醒了的社会中取得进行研究的必要资料。
    当我们努力为科学的发展和发扬创造最良好的条件的时候，我们永远不要忘记：在社会中罗致对科学活动有热诚的人们，教育他们并为他们提供必要的资料，这是绝对重要的。在很多很多国家中，科学工作者还只是从社会某些特权阶层中培养出来的。为了对人群整体的最大利益，任何一个能对科学大厦有所贡献的人都不应该受到阻碍。
    在人类活动当中，很少有像扩军备战这样明显的错误活动，只要稍为看一看在各国预算中用之于生产军火和维持强大军队的庞大款额，就可以看出，如果把这些浪费掉的巨大工作用之于和平建设，将给人类带来多大的利益。此刻，各国都这样关心这一个问题，科学家自然也不例外。但是他们还要尽一个特殊的职责，即廓清某些科学上和技术上的障碍物，不让它们再被人用来为不可能监督裁军和不可能禁止大规模毁灭性武器的谬论张目。
    亲爱的朋友们，当你们思考一部单靠它就能担任一大群人的劳动的巨大机器，或者甚至当你们使用一件粗糙的、但是可以减轻人的劳力的工具的时候，你们一定时常感到由于征服自然力而激起的自豪。
    这个集体的自豪和骄傲毫无共同之点。当科学工作者由于他们的工作而来观察科学永不中断的发展道路时，他们时常会有这样的感觉。保尔·郎之万把这个发展道路说成是：
    “过去和将来的活的联系；是一代一代传递下去的思想的火炬，燃得越来越高的火焰。”
    我们科学家应该永远记得，从事一个令人热爱，永远革新的职业，是一个巨大的特权。但是，我们所以能够继承在我们以前的那些筚路蓝缕，为我们留下宝贵的知识遗产的人们，那是全靠社会的全体成员，他们在过去，并且在现在继续完成他们保证人类生活的工作，没有他们，我们的工作根本就不可能进行。
    为了报答全人类，我们应该毫不疏忽，以使全人类都能充分享受历代科学家们积累起来的工作成果。同样的工作方法，共同的目标可以在各国科学家之间建立一些共同之点，使他们成为国际合作和友好的缔造者。
    我们从我们的大师们那里接受过来，并努力加以丰富，以传之于后人的科学遗产，我们应该向全体同胞负责加以维护。我们希望能够随时都对我们周围的人们没有愧色，他们有权利要求我们拿出工作成绩来。我们希望能够以完成了职责的心安理得的心情来从事我们这个令人热爱的职业。因此，我们应该每天都问问自己：“你是否竭尽了全力使科学服务于人类的幸福，有助于和平的保证？”我们应该永远努力工作，使我们能够对上列问题作肯定的回答，只有这时候，我们才在人类大社会中感到自豪和幸福。
