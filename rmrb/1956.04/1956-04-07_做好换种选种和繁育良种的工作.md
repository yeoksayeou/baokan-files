Doing a Good Job in Seed Renewal, Seed Selection, and Breeding of Fine Varieties
Wang Zhimin

Seed is one of the basic means of production in agricultural production. Only by using superior varieties and seeds of good quality can we guarantee large-scale increased production. Therefore, all agricultural production cooperatives should, in conjunction with agricultural production plans, conscientiously formulate seed plans and actively breed and promote superior varieties.

Agricultural production cooperatives should take various effective measures to popularize superior varieties. If there are superior varieties nearby, they should first actively replace them; if there are no outstanding superior varieties nearby, they should also select better varieties from local farmers' varieties for planting. Agricultural production cooperatives should adopt the most suitable varieties according to different field terrain, soil quality, water conservancy, fertilization and other conditions to ensure increased production. This is the only way to give full play to the cooperative’s advantage of "planting according to local conditions."

The best way for agricultural production cooperatives to solve the seed problem is to establish seed plots. That is, the cooperative allocates a certain amount of land, adopts good cultivation methods, and breeds fine seeds to meet the needs of general field planting. In the past, some places did not pay attention to the breeding of fine varieties, so that the promoted fine varieties degenerated after a long time. Setting up seed plots makes it easy to concentrate management, facilitate the adoption of good cultivation techniques, continuously improve the quality of fine varieties, and prevent the degeneration of fine varieties.

Agricultural production cooperatives have good conditions for establishing seed plots. Because of the centralized use of land and unified arrangement of manpower, cooperatives have the conditions to select the best land to use as seed plots, and to select experienced members to be responsible for the specialized cultivation of seeds.

After the fine seeds are bred, they must be properly stored. The selected seeds should be stacked, threshed, and dried separately, and stored in special warehouses (the warehouses should be sprayed with medicine in advance); different varieties should be stored separately, each with a label, and a seed keeper should be responsible for the storage to ensure the quality of the seeds. If the conditions for centralized storage are not available, the cooperative can assign the seeds to each production team for storage according to the specific situation. During the storage period, frequent inspections, turning, and drying should be carried out to prevent rats and birds, so as to ensure the quality of the seeds and prevent losses.

The seeds required by newly established cooperatives should generally be collected and solved by the members. Some farmers think that after joining the cooperative, all problems will be solved by the cooperative, and the government will lend them seeds if they are short of them. Therefore, they eat the seeds, or keep the good seeds and only hand over the general grain to the cooperative, which will inevitably affect the increased production of the entire cooperative. The cooperative should educate the members, explaining that before the cooperative has its own bred fine seeds, the seeds originally selected and retained by the members must be used for sowing. At the same time, methods of premium prices for quality can be formulated to encourage members to bring good seeds into the cooperative.

After the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives, the cultivated area of superior varieties will be rapidly expanded, and many varieties originally planted by farmers will be rapidly replaced by the promoted superior varieties. However, it should be recognized that a large number of farmer varieties were originally cultivated by working farmers under various conditions for a long time. These varieties have their own characteristics or advantages, and are valuable materials for creating new varieties (and some varieties will be quite good varieties if they are changed to another region). If they are not collected and preserved in a planned way and allowed to be lost, the work of improving varieties will suffer irreparable losses. Agricultural cooperatives should pay attention to collecting and preserving good farmer varieties; agricultural administrative departments and agricultural scientific research institutions in various provinces should quickly study and negotiate methods to vigorously and widely collect farmer varieties through agricultural production cooperatives this year, and send them to agricultural scientific research institutes or designated experimental stations in various regions for responsible preservation and identification research, so as to appropriately utilize them.

    做好换种选种和繁育良种的工作
    王志民
    种子是农业生产中的基本生产资料之一，采用优良品种和质量较好的种子，才能保证大面积增产。因此，各个农业生产合作社应该结合农业生产规划，切实做好关于种子的规划，积极繁育和推广优良品种。
    农业生产合作社对于普及良种应该采取各种有效措施。凡是附近有优良品种，首先应该积极换用；如果附近没有突出的优良品种，也应该从本地农家品种中选用较好的品种来栽种。农业生产合作社应该根据不同田地地势、土质、水利、施肥等条件，分别采用最适宜的品种，以保证增产。这样才能发挥合作社“因地种植”的优越性。
    农业生产合作社解决种子问题最好的办法，是建立种子地。这就是，由社划出一定数量的田，采用良好的栽培方法，繁殖良种，以供一般田地播种的需要。过去有些地方由于没有重视良种培育工作，以致推广的良种，年代久了，就退化了。设置种子地，容易集中管理，便于采取良好的栽培技术措施，不断提高良种的质量，防止良种的退化。
    农业生产合作社建立种子地是有良好条件的。因为集中使用土地，统一安排人力，合作社就有条件选择最好的土地来做种子地，并且选派有经验的社员负责专门培育种子的工作。
    在良种繁育出来以后，还要妥善地加以保管。选留的种子要分场堆放、脱粒、晒干，专仓贮藏（仓房中事先喷打了药剂）；不同品种要分别贮放，各加标签，设种子保管员负责保管，以保证种子的质量。如果集中贮藏的条件不具备，合作社可以根据具体情况，把种子分归各生产队分别保管。贮藏期间还要经常检查、翻晒、防除鼠雀，以保证种子的质量和防止损失。
    新建社所需的种子，一般应该由社员凑集解决。有些农民以为入了社，一切问题社里都会解决，缺少种子政府也会贷给，因而把种子吃掉，或把良好种子留下，只用一般粮食交给社，这必然会影响全社的增产。合作社应该向社员进行教育，说明在社里还没有自己繁殖的良种以前，必须用社员原来选留的种子来播种。同时还可以订出优质优价办法，鼓励社员带好种入社。
    在农业生产合作社大量发展后，优良品种的栽培面积将很快扩大，很多农家原来种植的品种将迅速地被推广的优良品种所代替。但是应该认识，大量的农家品种原来是劳动农民在各种不同条件下长期培育出来的，这些品种各有其特性或优点，是创造新品种的宝贵材料（并且有些品种换个地区就会是一个相当好的品种），如果不有计划地搜集保存，听其遗失，就会使改进品种的工作受到不可弥补的损失。农业合作社要注意收集和保存农家良种；各省农业行政主管机关和农业科学研究机构应该迅速研究和商订办法，在本年度通过农业生产合作社大力广泛搜集农家品种，送交各地区农业科学研究所或指定的试验场站负责保存，进行鉴别研究，以便适当加以利用。
