The Ministry of Culture convened a drama work conference in Beijing from the 10th to the 17th.

The conference summarized the achievements and shortcomings of Chinese drama work over the past six years, and determined that the current drama work policy should be: vigorously develop drama creation and strengthen the management of repertoire; improve the performance quality of existing drama theaters and troupes; systematically improve the political, professional, and cultural levels of existing drama workers; extensively develop mass amateur drama activities; steadily develop drama troupes that perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers and establish high-level drama theaters based on the principle of combining popularization and improvement; and develop drama troupes for fraternal nationalities and children's drama troupes, so that a wider range of the masses can receive socialist ideological education through drama performances.

The conference discussed the twelve-year plan for drama development.

Regarding measures to promote drama creation, the conference determined that cultural departments should further strengthen the training of young playwrights and expand the ranks of amateur playwrights; formulate drama script creation plans to assist playwrights in their creation; and further strengthen the publication and translation of scripts.

The conference also studied specific methods for improving the political, professional, and cultural levels of drama directors, actors, and stage art workers, and required professional drama groups to strengthen guidance for amateur drama groups. The conference emphasized the importance of drama workers learning from national artistic traditions.

The conference pointed out that drama troupes must resolutely implement the policy of enterprise management. The purpose of implementing enterprise management is to improve artistic quality and strengthen the connection between drama and the people. When implementing the enterprise management policy, reasonable adjustments should be made to staffing, and rehearsal and performance should be organized scientifically; artistic production should be vigorously organized, artistic quality should be improved, and outstanding actors should be cultivated; theater management should be improved, a strict economic accounting system should be implemented, and performance costs and administrative expenses should be reduced.

The conference also studied issues such as strengthening the theoretical construction of drama, further developing drama criticism, strengthening leadership over drama work, and improving the working conditions of drama workers.

During the conference, Qian Junrui and Liu Zhiming, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Culture, gave reports, and representatives from drama groups in various regions exchanged experiences. (Xinhua News Agency)

    话剧工作会议确定当前话剧工作方针
    文化部从十日到十七日在北京召开了话剧工作会议。
    会议总结了六年来中国话剧工作的成就和缺点，确定当前话剧工作的方针应是：大力发展话剧创作和加强对剧目的管理，提高现有话剧院、话剧团的演出质量；有计划地提高现有话剧工作者的政治、业务、文化水平；广泛开展群众业余话剧活动；根据普及与提高相结合的原则，稳步发展深入工农兵演出的话剧团并建立水平较高的话剧院；发展兄弟民族的话剧团和儿童剧团，使更广大的群众在话剧演出中受到社会主义思想教育。
    会议讨论了话剧事业十二年的规划。
    在繁荣话剧创作的措施方面，会议确定文化部门今后应该进一步加强对青年剧作者的培养，扩大业余剧作者的队伍；制定剧本创作规划，帮助剧作家进行创作；进一步加强剧本的出版和翻译工作。
    会议还研究了提高话剧导演、演员、舞台美术工作人员等的政治、业务、文化水平的具体办法，并且要求专业话剧团体加强对业余话剧团体的辅导。会议强调指出话剧工作者向民族艺术传统学习的重要性。
