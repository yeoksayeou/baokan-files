    In the industrial and transportation sectors, the broad masses of workers and staff have put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals in just the past two or three months. Many of these proposals were made after joint research by workers and technicians, and they have solved some key problems in production. Enterprise leaders have generally adopted a positive attitude towards the rationalization proposals of workers and staff. This is a new phenomenon in the high tide of socialism in our country. At present, the task of the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations in enterprises is to strengthen leadership over the work of rationalization proposals, further support and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses in making rationalization proposals, so that the rationalization proposals of the broad masses of workers and staff can play a greater role in the struggle to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the state plan.
    Timely handling and implementation of rationalization proposals is an important issue for whether the work of rationalization proposals can be carried out well. Due to the unprecedented increase in the number of rationalization proposals this year, the original organizations and personnel in enterprises for handling rationalization proposals are overwhelmed, and many proposals have been backlogged. This problem must be solved, and it is entirely solvable. The key lies in improving the cumbersome procedures for approving rationalization proposals that shackle the masses and are not adapted to the current new situation; giving enterprises greater authority to approve and implement rationalization proposals; establishing and improving organizational structures for handling rationalization proposals in enterprises; and fully relying on the strength of the masses to handle and implement rationalization proposals. This is what enterprises like the Wusan Factory, Shenyang Water Pump Factory, Wuchang Vehicle Factory, and Changchun Metrology Factory have done. In the past, some of these factories had to go through more than a dozen levels to handle rationalization proposals, and some had to spend several months. Now, they stipulate that, except for major rationalization proposals that require changes in product design, regulations, suggestions from Soviet experts, and involve relatively large expenditures, which are to be reviewed and handled by the factory, bureau, or ministry depending on the circumstances, general rationalization proposals should be resolved by the team if the team can resolve them, by the section if the section can resolve them, and by the workshop if the workshop can resolve them. This greatly shortens the handling process of rationalization proposals and accelerates their implementation. There are also some enterprises that prioritize according to importance and urgency, concentrating major technical forces to first handle rationalization proposals put forward for major key problems in production, so that these major rationalization proposals can be quickly put into practice in production. These are all better experiences in timely handling and implementation of rationalization proposals, which can motivate the enthusiasm of the masses in making rationalization proposals, quickly leverage the role of rationalization proposals in improving production, and make leadership work more proactive.
    Of course, vigorously supporting the masses in making rationalization proposals and letting the masses and lower-level organizations handle rationalization proposals themselves does not mean that leadership can be abandoned. Currently, some enterprises have experienced situations where the masses make rationalization proposals and implement them automatically without waiting for or even going through the review and evaluation of a certain organization. This practice is inappropriate, as it undermines the seriousness of technical discipline in enterprises, and may lead to production accidents, affect product quality, and disrupt normal production order. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to insist that rationalization proposals must go through the procedures of review and approval. There are also some enterprises where workers make very good rationalization proposals, but the sections or workshops do not support them or report them to higher levels; or after adopting rationalization proposals, they do not reward them in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Rewards for Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production," which frustrates the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, it is also necessary to strengthen leadership and regularly check and supervise the work of lower-level organizations.
    Another relatively common problem in the current work of rationalization proposals is that there are more proposals for increasing production efficiency and output, and fewer proposals for improving quality and reducing costs. This reflects that some enterprises have one-sided thinking in implementing the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." Although they also put forward topics to guide the masses to make rationalization proposals for key problems in production, their so-called key problems often refer only to weak links that affect the increase in output, and they have not given importance to quality and economy. In the first two months, the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory had more than 500 rationalization proposals, but during the same period, the product return rate was still above 20%, exceeding the national control target by a factor of ten. After many factories increased their output targets, the supply of raw materials became very tight, but the leaders of these enterprises were afraid of dampening the enthusiasm of the masses for increasing production, so they did not dare to tell the masses about this difficulty and were unable to mobilize the masses to make rationalization proposals in terms of saving raw materials. The leadership must change this one-sided guiding ideology so that the creative power of the masses can be more closely integrated with solving the most urgent tasks of the state and enterprises, and that rationalization proposals can play a comprehensive role in ensuring the completion of the state plan. There are also some enterprise leaders who still have a certain degree of blindness in their leadership of rationalization proposal work, and have not paid attention to guiding the masses to solve key problems in production, so that although there are many rationalization proposals, there are no achievements in improving product quality and reducing costs, and even the output value and output plan cannot be completed, which requires even more analysis of the enterprise's production situation, finding the key to comprehensively completing the state plan, and mobilizing the masses to make rationalization proposals.
    To make the work of rationalization proposals carried out well, mobilizing technicians to participate in the work of rationalization proposals is also an important link. Technicians should be encouraged to help workers study and implement rationalization proposals, and technicians should be mobilized to make rationalization proposals themselves. They have a relatively high level of technology, a more comprehensive understanding of the technical conditions in the enterprise, and their proposals can often solve more important problems and create more wealth. For example, Pang Hongquan, a technician at the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, proposed improving the design structure of the product, which reduced the weight of the K-type water pump by 60%, greatly reduced material consumption, reduced costs, and made the water pump more convenient to use. The technicians in the process section of a factory in Shenyang put forward 150 rationalization proposals and proactively sent them to the workshop, asking the workers to help review them. Unfortunately, such things are still rare, and many enterprises have not paid attention to mobilizing technicians to make rationalization proposals, and some even do not recognize the initiatives of technicians to improve work as rationalization proposals, so they do not praise or reward them.
    The work of rationalization proposals in this recent period has generally been carried out well, but some enterprises have also shown a tendency towards formalism. The state-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1 adopted the method of challenge and response to encourage workers to pursue the quantity of rationalization proposals. As a result, a large proportion of the proposals were not put forward according to the needs of production, and some had almost nothing to do with production. The leaders of these enterprises regard rationalization proposals as something to decorate the facade, and what they pursue is only superficial fanfare, busy with calling, statistics, and reporting, but not concerned about the actual effect of rationalization proposals. This tendency of formalism must be corrected. The phenomenon of suppressing rationalization proposals and打击 (dǎjī) the enthusiasm of the masses still exists in some enterprises. Therefore, in some enterprises during this period, rationalization proposals have not only not increased, but have decreased. The main task of these enterprises at present is still to examine right-leaning conservative thinking and overcome bureaucratic work styles. Local Party organizations must especially strengthen the inspection and supervision of these enterprises.

### 积极领导合理化建议工作

    积极领导合理化建议工作
      工业运输部门中的广大职工，在今年短短的两三个月当中，提出了成千成万条合理化建议。许多建议都是工人和技术人员共同研究后提出来的，这些合理化建议解决了一些生产中的关键问题。企业的领导者对职工的合理化建议一般也都采取了积极支持的态度。这是我国社会主义高潮中的新气象。目前，企业中的党、行政和工会组织的任务，就是要加强对合理化建议工作的领导，进一步支持和鼓励群众提合理化建议的积极性，使广大职工群众的合理化建议在为全面完成和超额完成国家计划的斗争中发挥更大的作用。
    及时处理和实现合理化建议，是当前合理化建议工作能不能很好开展的一个重要问题。由于今年合理化建议的数量空前增加，企业中原有的处理合理化建议的机构和人员应接不暇，许多建议已经被积压起来。这个问题必须解决，也是完全可以解决的。关键就在于改善那些束缚群众手脚的、繁琐的和不能适应目前新情况的审批合理化建议的制度和手续；给各企业以更大权力批准和实现合理化建议；建立和健全企业单位处理合理化建议的组织机构；充分依靠群众的力量来处理和实现合理化建议。五三工厂、沈阳水泵厂、武昌车辆厂、长春度量衡工厂等企业就是这样做的。这些工厂过去处理合理化建议有的要经过十几道关口，有的要花好几个月的时间，现在他们规定除了需要改变产品设计、规程制度、苏联专家的建议和花钱比较多的重大的合理化建议，要由厂部分别情形由厂、局、部审查处理外，一般的合理化建议，小组能够解决的就由小组解决，工段能够解决的就由工段解决，车间能够解决的就由车间解决。这就大大缩短了合理化建议的处理过程，加速了合理化建议的实现。还有一些企业分别轻重缓急，集中主要技术力量，首先处理针对生产中的重大关键问题提出来的合理化建议，使得这些重大的合理化建议能够迅速地在生产中付诸实现。这些都是及时处理和实现合理化建议的比较好的经验，都能够激励群众提合理化建议的积极性，迅速发挥合理化建议对改进生产的作用，并且使领导工作更加主动了。
    当然，大力支持群众提合理化建议，放手让群众和下级组织自己来处理合理化建议，并不是说可以放弃领导。现在有的企业已经发生了这样的情形，群众提了合理化建议，不等到、甚至不经过一定组织的审查鉴定，就自动实行起来。这种做法是不妥当的，它破坏了企业中技术纪律的严肃性，也就可能造成生产事故，影响产品质量，打乱正常的生产秩序。因此，坚持合理化建议一定要经过审查批准的手续，是完全必要的。还有一些企业，工人提了很好的合理化建议，但是工段或车间不加以支持，也不向上级反映；或者采纳了合理化建议后，不按照“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”进行奖励，使群众的热情受到挫折。因此，也必须加强领导，经常检查和监督下级组织的工作。
    当前合理化建议工作中另一个比较普遍的问题，是提高生产效率和增加产量的建议多，提高质量和降低成本的建议少。这反映了有些企业在贯彻“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针中存在着片面思想，他们虽然也提出课题，引导群众针对生产中的关键问题来提合理化建议，但是他们所谓的关键问题，常常指的只是影响产量增加的薄弱环节，而没有把质量和节约提到重要位置上来。沈阳低压开关厂一、二月份的合理化建议有五百多件，但在同一时期，产品的返修率却仍在20％以上，超过国家的控制指标十倍。有许多工厂产量指标提高之后，原材料的供应很紧张，但是这些企业的领导者怕挫伤群众的增产热情，不敢把这个困难告诉群众，没有能够发动群众在节省原材料方面提合理化建议。领导上必须改变这种片面的指导思想，使群众的创造力量同解决国家和企业当前最迫切的任务更紧密地结合起来，使合理化建议对保证完成国家计划全面地发挥作用。还有些企业的领导人员，至今对合理化建议工作的领导还存在着一定程度的盲目性，还没有注意引导群众解决生产中的关键问题，以致合理化建议虽不少，但是提高产品质量和降低成本方面并没有什么成绩，甚至连产值、产量计划都完不成，这就更需要分析企业的生产情况，找出全面完成国家计划的关键，发动群众提合理化建议。
    要使合理化建议工作开展得好，发动技术人员参加合理化建议工作，也是一个重要环节。应该鼓励技术人员帮助工人研究和实现合理化建议，并发动技术人员自己提合理化建议。他们有比较高的技术水平，比较全面地了解企业中的技术状况，他们提的建议，常常能够解决更重要的问题，创造更多的财富。例如沈阳水泵厂技术员庞鸿泉提出了改进产品设计结构的建议，使得K型水泵的重量减轻了60％，大大减少了材料消耗，降低了成本，水泵使用起来也更加方便。沈阳有一个工厂的工艺科的技术人员，提了一百五十条合理化建议，并且主动地送到车间，请工人帮助审查。可惜，这样的事情还不多，许多企业还没有重视发动技术人员提合理化建议，有的甚至不承认技术人员改进工作的倡议是合理化建议，因而不表扬，也不奖励。
    最近这个时期的合理化建议工作进行得基本上是良好的，但是也有一些企业产生了形式主义的倾向。国营上海卷烟一厂采用挑战应战的方法，鼓励工人追求合理化建议数量。结果是很大部分的建议不是根据生产的要求提出来的，有些同生产简直没有什么关系。这些企业的领导者，把合理化建议当做装璜门面的东西，他们追求的只是表面的轰轰烈烈，忙于号召、统计、上报，而不关心合理化建议的实际效果。这种形式主义的倾向必须纠正。压制合理化建议，打击群众积极性的现象在有些企业中也仍然存在着。因此有的企业在这一时期，合理化建议不但没有增多，反而减少了。这些企业当前的主要任务，仍然是检查右倾保守思想，克服官僚主义作风。地方党组织特别要加强对这些企业的检查和督促。
