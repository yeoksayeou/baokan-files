Shanxi Province's investment in county and township roads this year is equal to 140% of the total investment in the past six years. Within one year, all fifteen county towns without access to automobiles or trains, such as Pinglu, Wutai, and Lanxian, will have simple roads built to them. At the same time, roads will be newly built and renovated in major market towns, railway stations, and Yellow River ferry crossings. Furthermore, according to needs and possible conditions, necessary roads will be newly built and renovated in general townships in mountainous areas and old revolutionary base areas, as well as for some agricultural production cooperatives with automobiles and horse-drawn carts. Trees will also be widely planted along the roads.

    山西省加速建设地方道路网
    山西省今年县乡道路投资等于过去六年投资总数的140％。一年内，平鲁、五台、岚县等十五座不通汽车、火车的县城，全部要修通简易公路。同时，要新建和改建主要集镇、铁路车站和黄河渡口的道路，并且要根据需要和可能条件，新建和改建山区和老根据地的一般乡和部分有汽车、马车的农业生产合作社的必要道路。在道路旁边，还要广泛种树。
