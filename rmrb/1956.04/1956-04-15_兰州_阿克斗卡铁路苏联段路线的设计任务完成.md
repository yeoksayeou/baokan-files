Xinhua News Agency, April 14th, Alma-Ata, April 13th (TASS): The Soviet Union has completed the design task for the Soviet section of the railway line from Lanzhou, China, to Aktogay station on the Turkestan-Siberia Railway in the Soviet Union. Currently, a Soviet geological team has begun searching for sand, stone, and other construction materials in the southern section of the route and is also searching for sources of fresh water for Aktogay, the future railway town. This was stated to a TASS reporter by Savchenko, the chief engineer of the Siberian State Transportation Design Institute of the Soviet Union.

Savchenko said that last year, four survey teams and two geological teams from the Siberian State Transportation Design Institute conducted preliminary survey work on the route from the Turkestan-Siberia trunk line to the border. Based on the survey results, several route options were proposed. Among them, a route starting from Aktogay station was the most economical and effective. The route from Aktogay to the Soviet border is 308 kilometers long. This new railway will not only connect the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China via the shortest route but will also have a significant impact on the development of the national economy in Andreyev, Dzerzhinsky, and other districts of the Taldy-Kurgan Oblast of the Kazakh Republic.

    兰州—阿克斗卡铁路苏联段路线的设计任务完成
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社阿拉木图十三日讯：苏联已经完成了从中国兰州到苏联土尔克斯坦—西伯利亚铁路阿克斗卡站的铁路线的苏联段的设计任务。现在，苏联一个地质工作队已经开始在路线南部找寻砂子、石头和其他建筑材料，并且为阿克斗卡这个未来的铁路市镇找寻淡水的水源。这是苏联西伯利亚国家运输设计院总工程师萨夫钦科夫对塔斯社记者说的。
    萨夫钦科夫说，去年，西伯利亚国家运输设计院的四个勘察工作队和两个地质工作队，在从土尔克斯坦—西伯利亚干线到国境的路线上进行了初步的勘察工作。根据勘察结果，共提出了几个路线方案。其中以从阿克斗卡站开始的一条路线最经济而且效力最大。阿克斗卡到苏联国境的路线全长308公里。这条新的铁路不但用最短的路线把苏联同中华人民共和国联系起来，而且将对哈萨克共和国塔尔迪—库尔干州安德烈耶夫、捷尔任斯基和其他区的国民经济的发展有重大的影响。
