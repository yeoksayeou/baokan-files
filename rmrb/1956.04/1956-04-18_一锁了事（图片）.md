    One Lock Solves Everything
  　Yingtāo
    ——Want to understand our archive work? The archives are all locked in iron cabinets, and the keys are kept by honest people.
    The leading comrades of some units mistakenly believe that archive work is just "guarding documents," and have not done a good job in the sorting, organization, and utilization of archives.

    一锁了事
  　英韬
    ——要了解我们的档案工作吗？档案都锁在铁柜里，钥匙由老实的人保管着。
    有些单位的领导同志错误地认为档案工作只是“看管文件”，没有做好档案的整理和组织利用等工作。
