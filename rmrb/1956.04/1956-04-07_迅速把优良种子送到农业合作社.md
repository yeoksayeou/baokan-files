Promoting and Breeding Superior Varieties to Increase Crop Yields
    Quickly Deliver Superior Seeds to Agricultural Cooperatives

    Actively breeding and promoting superior varieties is an effective and fundamental measure to rapidly increase the yield per unit area of crops. Using superior varieties does not require a large increase in investment, and can increase production by several to tens of percent more than using ordinary varieties under the same conditions. At the same time, it must be understood that if superior varieties are not used while improving cultivation techniques, significant yield increases cannot be obtained.
    In the work of promoting superior seeds, the most important task at present is to quickly deliver large quantities of superior seeds to farmers before sowing. In order to increase yield per unit area, many agricultural production cooperatives are taking the planting of superior varieties as an important measure to increase production this year, and need to add some superior varieties that have not been planted before. This year, the work of transferring superior varieties between provinces and between counties has been much heavier than in previous years. Superior rice seeds from Hebei and Tianjin are being transferred to Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan; superior potato seeds from Heilongjiang are being transferred to Guangdong and Guangxi. The journey is long, the quantity is large, and some areas are still being adjusted. Now the sowing time is very urgent, and all units responsible for transferring superior varieties should immediately conduct a thorough inspection of the transfer work, find problems and solve them in time, and deliver the superior seeds to farmers in time before spring plowing and sowing.
    Although departments of agriculture, grain, and supply and marketing cooperatives have transferred huge quantities of superior varieties, they have not completely solved the problem of insufficient superior varieties. In Shaping District, Changsha County, Hunan Province, 46 out of 55 agricultural cooperatives lack more than 110,000 jin of early rice superior seeds, and 4 cooperatives lack 700 jin of intercropped late rice superior seeds. Nanguan Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, generally lacks superior varieties of sweet potatoes, peanuts, cotton, and tobacco. This situation most powerfully illustrates the fact that the seed problem cannot be solved solely by transferring from other places. On-site selection and adjustment of superior varieties is a regular and reliable way to solve this problem. Jiangjin Prefecture, Sichuan Province, adopted the method of selecting local superior varieties and selected 26 kinds of early rice and late rice superior varieties such as "Xiba Early," "Sanmang Xian," and "Xiaobai Gu," which completely solved the problem of the entire region lacking superior seeds for 600,000 mu of double-cropping rice. Whether buying, selling, or exchanging, on-site adjustment of superior seeds must adhere to the principle of mutual benefit to ensure that farmers who provide superior seeds obtain appropriate compensation.
    Seeds transported over long distances and seeds adjusted locally are prone to phenomena such as seed mixing and deterioration. Agricultural production leading departments, seed supply departments, and agricultural cooperatives should strictly inspect seeds transferred from other regions and immediately take appropriate measures if they find mixing, deterioration, or signs of pests and diseases. The seeds turned over to agricultural cooperatives by members are complex in variety and of uneven quality. Cooperatives should also conduct an inspection of these seeds and sow them separately according to different varieties. In order to prevent mixing of varieties, agricultural cooperatives must conduct an inspection of the seeds before sowing and fully prepare the seeds to be sown. If they are mixed and then processed, it will be time-consuming and laborious and delay the sowing time.

    推广和繁育优良品种，提高农作物的产量
    迅速把优良种子送到农业合作社

    积极繁育和推广优良品种，是迅速提高农作物单位产量的一项有效的根本措施。采用优良品种不必增加大量的投资，就可以在同样的条件下比用一般品种增产百分之几到百分之几十以上。同时，必须了解：在改进耕作技术的同时，如果不采用优良品种，就不可能得到显著的增产效果。
    在推广良种的工作中，当前最重要的一项工作，就是迅速把大批优良种子在播种前送到农民的手里。为了提高单位面积产量，今年许多农业生产合作社把种植优良品种做为一个重要的增产措施，需要增添某些没有种植过的优良品种。今年省和省之间，县和县之间调运优良品种的工作，比较往年加重了很多。河北天津地区的优良稻种调往四川、湖北、湖南；黑龙江的马铃薯良种调往广东、广西，路途很远，数量很大，有些地区目前还在调剂。现在距离播种时间非常紧迫了，各个担负调运优良品种任务的单位，应该立即把调运工作进行一次彻底的检查，发现问题，及时解决，在春耕播种以前，把良种及时送到农民手里。
    尽管农业、粮食、供销合作等部门已经调运了数量巨大的优良品种，但是，远远没有完全解决优良品种不足的问题。湖南长沙县沙坪区有五十五个农业合作社，其中四十六个缺少早稻良种十一万多斤，四个社缺少间作晚稻良种七百斤。河南鲁山县南关乡，普遍缺少甘薯、花生、棉花、烟草的优良品种。这种情况最有力的说明了这样一个事实：种子问题绝对不能单纯依靠外地调运来解决，就地评选和调剂优良品种，是解决这个问题的经常可靠的办法。四川江津专区采用评选当地良种的办法，选出了“西坝早”、“三芒籼”、“小白谷”等二十六种早稻、晚稻良种，完全解决了全区缺少六十万亩双季稻良种的问题。就地调剂良种，不论买卖或者交换，都必须坚持互利的原则，保证拿出良种的农民取得适当的代价。
    远途调运种子和在本地调剂种子，都容易发生种子混杂、变质等现象。农业生产领导部门、种子供应部门和农业合作社，应该把外区调入的种子，加以严格的检查，发现混杂、变质和带有病虫害的现象，立即进行适当的处理。社员交给农业合作社的种子，品种复杂，质量好坏不齐。合作社对于这些种子也应该进行一次检查，按照不同的品种分别播种。为了防止品种混杂，农业合作社在播种以前一定要对种子进行一次检查，把准备播种的种子完全准备好，等它混杂了再处理，就要费时费事，贻误播种时间。
