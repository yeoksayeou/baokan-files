Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 18th: Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo stated in the Parliament on April 17th, "Regarding Indonesia's relations with Asian and African countries, we will continue to implement an independent policy based on the spirit of the resolutions passed at the Bandung Asian-African Conference last year, especially the ten principles stipulated in the declaration on striving to promote world peace and cooperation. That is to say, we should first strive to seek a common ground that can be used to enhance mutual understanding. We do this in the hope of strengthening our relations with those countries."

Sastroamidjojo made these remarks while responding on behalf of the government during the parliamentary debate on the government's policy statement.

He also said that some countries have different views on defending the security of their respective countries and defending world peace and security, and some countries have already associated themselves with certain alliances. "This does not constitute a reason for us not to explore all possible ways to avoid or mitigate tensions on the basis of peaceful coexistence. These tensions may arise due to the aforementioned different views."

When discussing the issue of abolishing the Round Table Conference Agreement, Sastroamidjojo emphasized that the government wants to abolish all the agreements of the Round Table Conference, including the charter on the transfer of sovereignty.

He said that the struggle to recover West Irian within the United Nations will continue, and preparations for this purpose have already begun. The establishment of West Irian Province will soon be realized.

Sastroamidjojo said that the government intends to submit a bill on the rehabilitation plan during the second session of the parliament. "The government believes that these projects should be funded with our own strength."

He said: The government will reconsider the statement on foreign investment policy made by the former Harahap cabinet, and will revise the national budget for the 1956 fiscal year drafted by the former cabinet in order to reduce the deficit. The government will promulgate land laws. Emergency Law No. 8 will be implemented for those who occupied foreign plantation land during the Japanese occupation or revolution. This law stipulates that those people cannot be arbitrarily evicted from their land.

When speaking, Sastroamidjojo reviewed the issue of the cabinet composition that many members of parliament had mentioned in their speeches. He said that from the beginning, the government recognized that there was a general public disappointment with the composition of the cabinet. He asked the parliament to understand the government's perspective on this issue.

He said that the only guideline followed by the government's policy is the cabinet program explained in the statement issued by the cabinet on April 9th, and the government will certainly consider the constructive suggestions put forward by the people, various groups, and the All-Indonesia People's Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 18th: Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo reiterated Indonesia's opposition to embargoes at a press conference on April 17th.

He said that if anyone wishes to maintain the embargo, Indonesia will oppose it. If anyone proposes a motion to abolish the embargo in the United Nations, Indonesia will support it.

Regarding Soviet aid, Sastroamidjojo said that Indonesia, in principle, does not refuse foreign aid from any party, as long as such aid does not have any binding conditions attached.

When talking about the results of the Ceylon election and the establishment of the new government, he said: "According to newspaper reports, Ceylon will implement the same independent policy that we have adopted. We are very happy to hear this news."

Sastroamidjojo stated that his government will do its best to support the convening of the Asian-African Student Conference.

    沙斯特罗阿米佐约谈印度尼西亚的内外政策
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约四月十七日在国会说：“在印度尼西亚和亚非国家的关系方面，将继续在去年万隆亚非会议通过的决议的精神的基础上，特别是在关于努力促进世界和平和合作的声明中所规定的十项原则的基础上，执行独立的政策。这就是说，首先应当努力寻求能够用来增进相互了解的共同基础。我们这样做是希望能够加强我们和那些国家的关系。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约是在国会辩论政府的政策声明中代表政府作答复的时候说这番话的。
    他还说，某些国家在保卫它们各自国家的安全同保卫世界和平和安全方面有着不同的观点，某些国家已经把它们自己和某些联盟联系起来。“这并不构成理由使我们不去在和平共处的基础上来探讨一切可能避免或者缓和紧张局势的途径。这种紧张局势是可能由于上述不同观点而引起的。”
    在谈到废除圆桌会议协定问题的时候，沙斯特罗阿米佐约强调说，政府要废除圆桌会议的全部协定，包括移交主权的宪章在内。
    他说，在联合国内进行收回西伊里安的斗争将继续下去，为了这个目的进行的准备工作已经开始。西伊里安省的设立不久便将实现。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，政府打算在国会第二次会议期间提出关于复兴计划的法案。“政府认为这些工程应当用我们自己的力量来出资进行。”
    他说：政府将重新考虑前哈拉哈普内阁关于外国投资政策的声明，并且将修改前内阁所草拟的1956年财政年度的国家预算，以便减少赤字。政府将颁布土地法。将对那些在日本占领或革命时期占据了外国庄园土地的人实行第八号紧急法。这个法律规定不能随便把那些人赶出他们的土地的。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约在发言的时候回顾了许多议员在发言中都提到的内阁的成分问题。他说，从一开始，政府就承认公众普遍存在着对内阁成分感到失望的情绪。他要求国会了解政府在这个问题上所采取的观点。
    他说，政府政策所遵循的唯一的指示就是内阁四月九日发表的声明中所解释的那个内阁政纲，政府当然要考虑人民、各团体以及全印度尼西亚人民代表大会所提出的建设性建议。
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约四月十七日在记者招待会上重申印度尼西亚反对禁运。
    他说，如果任何人希望维持禁运，印度尼西亚是要反对的。如果任何人在联合国提出废除禁运的动议，印度尼西亚将给予支持。
    关于苏联的援助，沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，印度尼西亚在原则上不拒绝从任何一方来的外国援助，只要这种援助没有附带任何约束性的条件。
    他在谈到锡兰选举的结果和新政府的成立时说：“据报纸报道，锡兰将执行跟我们所采取的一样的独立政策。我们很高兴听到这个消息。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约表示，他的政府将尽力支持亚非学生会议的召开。
