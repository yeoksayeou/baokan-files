    Continue Purchasing Stored Cotton in Cotton-Producing Areas
    Agricultural product purchasing departments in cotton-producing provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Hubei are continuing to purchase stored cotton from rural areas. Since the early completion of the national 1955 cotton purchasing plan in mid-March, they have purchased an additional 257,000 dan of ginned cotton by mid-April.
    In view of the current busy spring plowing season in rural areas, agricultural product purchasing departments in various regions are promoting the method of mobile, door-to-door purchasing of stored cotton.

    在产棉区继续收购存棉
    河北、山东、河南、湖北等产棉省的农产品采购部门，继续收购农村存棉。自三月中旬提前完成全国1955年度棉花收购计划后，到四月中旬，各地又收购了二十五万七千担皮棉。
    根据当前农村春耕生产繁忙的情况，各地农产品采购部门正在推广流动下乡收购存棉的方法。
