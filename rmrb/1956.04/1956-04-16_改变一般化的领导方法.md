Change Generalized Leadership Methods
To the Editors:
	No. 8 open-hearth furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant increased the production of steel by more than 6,400 tons for the country last year, and the production tasks for the first quarter of this year were also fully completed ahead of schedule on March 26. However, some open-hearth furnaces in the plant have failed to complete the state plan for a long time, and the plant as a whole failed to fully complete the state-stipulated production tasks in January and February this year.
	The reason why No. 8 open-hearth furnace has achieved such results in production is because they have some advanced experience in establishing necessary production systems, strengthening the unity of the three shifts, doing a good job in furnace maintenance, reducing the number of repairs, and shortening the smelting time. This experience is not only applicable to steelmaking, but also very meaningful to continuous production smelting enterprises. However, the production experience of No. 8 open-hearth furnace has not been promoted in the plant for a long time.
	On the surface, the Party, administrative, and trade union of the steelmaking plant seem to attach importance to the work of promoting the advanced experience of No. 8 open-hearth furnace. Since 1953, they have summarized the production experience of No. 8 open-hearth furnace almost every year, and also called on and arranged other open-hearth furnaces to learn. However, since each time is just an empty call and lacks specific organizational work, the promotion of the advanced experience of No. 8 open-hearth furnace often ends after a "boom." Until now, many open-hearth furnace workers in the plant still reflect: "No. 8 furnace has good equipment conditions, and the operating methods are nothing remarkable." The actual situation is not like this. The equipment of No. 8 open-hearth furnace is not better than other open-hearth furnaces, but they just pay attention to furnace maintenance; the operating experience of No. 8 open-hearth furnace is indeed more advanced. For example, after No. 7 open-hearth furnace learned the production experience of No. 8 furnace at the end of last year, it has fully completed the state plan for four consecutive months. Unfortunately, the leaders of the plant did not carry out specific and meticulous educational work, so that the conservative ideas of some workers could not be corrected in time, hindering the promotion of advanced experience.
	In addition, the promotion of the advanced experience of Soviet rapid steelmaking in the plant is also not good. After Comrade Kolesnikov, a Soviet steelworker, came to the plant last October to perform rapid steelmaking, it greatly stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for learning and production, so rapid steelmaking in October reached 214 furnaces, increasing the production of steel by more than 8,400 tons for the country. However, the harvest of rapid steelmaking in the first quarter of this year is not satisfactory.
	Promoting advanced experience is a meticulous and complex task. If we do not deeply grasp and timely solve the ideological problems of the workers and do a good job in a series of organizational work, it is difficult to achieve good results; even if it is promoted for a while, it is difficult to consolidate. It is hoped that the leaders of the steelmaking plant will overcome the generalized leadership methods in the work of promoting advanced experience, so as to better organize the production enthusiasm of the masses and quickly change the current situation of not being able to complete the state plan.

    改变一般化的领导方法
    编辑同志：
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂八号平炉去年为国家增产了六千四百多吨钢，今年第一季度的生产任务也提前在三月二十六日全面地完成了；但是厂里有些平炉却长期没有完成国家计划，今年一、二月份全厂就没有全面完成国家规定的生产任务。
    八号平炉在生产上所以能够取得这样的成绩，是因为他们在建立必要的生产制度、加强三班的团结、做好炉体维护、减少检修次数和缩短熔炼时间等方面有着一些先进的经验。这些经验不仅适用于炼钢，而且对连续生产的冶炼企业都是十分有意义的。但是，八号平炉的这些生产经验在本厂却长期没有推广。
    从表面上看，炼钢厂党、行政和工会似乎对推广八号平炉的先进经验工作是重视的。1953年以来，他们几乎每年都要总结八号平炉的生产经验，而且也号召和布置其他平炉进行学习。但是，由于每次只是空洞的号召，而缺乏具体的组织工作，因此推广八号平炉的先进经验往往只是“轰”一阵就完了。直到现在，厂里还有不少平炉工人反映：“八号炉设备条件好，操作方法没有什么了不起。”实际情况并不如此。八号平炉的设备不比别的平炉好，只不过是他们注意炉体维护罢了；八号平炉的操作经验的确是比较先进的，像七号平炉在去年年底学习八号炉的生产经验后，连续四个月全面地完成了国家计划。可惜的是，厂里的领导同志没有具体的细致的教育工作，以致使某些工人的保守思想不能及时被纠正，阻碍了先进经验的推广。
    另外，苏联快速炼钢的先进经验在厂里的推广情况也不好。去年十月，苏联炼钢工人科列斯尼科夫同志来厂表演快速炼钢以后，大大刺激了工人的学习热情和生产积极性，因此十月份的快速炼钢曾达到214炉，为国家增产了八千四百多吨钢。但是，今年第一季度全厂快速炼钢的收获却不能令人满意。
    推广先进经验是一项细致复杂的工作，如果不深入掌握和及时解决工人群众的思想问题，并且做好一系列的组织工作，就很难收到好的效果；即使一时推广起来了，但也难于巩固。希望炼钢厂领导人员在推广先进经验的工作中，要克服一般化的领导方法，以便把群众的生产积极性更好地组织起来，迅速改变目前不能完成国家计划的情况。
