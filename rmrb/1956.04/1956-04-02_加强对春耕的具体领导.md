Strengthen Specific Leadership Over Spring Plowing

When discussing this year's spring plowing and planting tasks, people first think of the various favorable conditions: the great achievements of the cooperative movement, the unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm of the masses, the significant achievements in preparatory work, and so on. These are all facts. This is a great victory won by millions of farmers under the education and leadership of the Party and is an important factor in widely launching the agricultural increase production campaign this year.

However, are there no problems with this year's spring plowing production? Of course, that is not the case. For the vast majority of regions in the country, it has not been long since the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization. Most rural work cadres and agricultural production cooperative cadres lack the experience of leading large-scale production in a collective form and lack methods for solving various new economic and technical problems. In most parts of the country, there has been relatively little rain and snow since last autumn and winter. Although there have been one or two spring rains, the drought has not been alleviated. In some areas, "nine out of ten ponds are dry" and planting is impossible. For various reasons, the phenomenon of weak draft cattle is quite common. The quantity of fertilizer accumulated in various places is more than in previous years, but the quality is mostly inferior. The amount of seeds transferred across the country is more than in previous years, but because the planting task is greater than in previous years, many areas still feel that the quantity is insufficient. The progress of popularizing double-wheeled double (single)铧 plows in some areas is slow, and there is a shortage of small farm tools. The progress of training various technical backbones is very uneven across regions, and there is a phenomenon of spontaneous relaxation in individual regions.

Anyone will understand that raising these issues now does not mean that this year's production conditions and this year's preparatory work are not as good as in previous years; rather, it is to illustrate that in order to complete this year's agricultural increase production task, which is much higher than in previous years, the vast majority of regions must continue to make great efforts on the basis of the existing preparatory work. This year, the country's planting area has increased by approximately 90 million mu compared to last year. Every rural worker should consider whether they are confident in completing this huge newly added planting task well. In some areas, although the preparatory work is better than in previous years, it cannot meet this year's needs. For example, in Xilala Village in the suburbs of Shenyang, the amount of manure accumulated this year has increased by half compared to last year, but this year's production plan is more than twice as high as last year's, and the existing fertilizer is certainly not enough. The preparatory work in some areas has been done very well, but new problems have arisen. Guangdong Province accumulated more than 3.5 billion dan of fertilizer last winter and this spring, which is a great achievement. By mid-March, half of the fertilizer had been sent to the fields, and the other half had not yet been sent. They calculated that at a rate of 20 dan per person per day, it would take more than 4 million laborers working continuously for 20 days to send it all. This spring, many new tasks have been added. How can they be completed without redoubled efforts!

Will raising these issues now scare some people? It should be said that as long as you stand up and fight difficulties with perseverance, all kinds of problems can be solved. The key to solving these problems lies in going deep and strengthening specific leadership. This can not only promptly discover weak links and difficult problems in the work but, more importantly, it can discover advanced experiences in overcoming various weak links and solving various difficult problems in the production practice of the masses. For example, spring drought often threatens rice transplanting and sowing in northern and southern China. Farmers in many areas of Hubei Province have adopted drought-resistant breeding methods and have already overcome local drought. The lack of draft animals often affects the progress of planting work. Jiajiang County, Sichuan Province, has implemented a method of mutual assistance and adjustment between districts, townships, and cooperatives, and the problem of the lack of draft cattle in the county has been basically solved. If there is not enough fertilizer, the existing fertilizer can be used as base fertilizer, and efforts can be made to rush to make top dressing fertilizer and promote the experience of economical fertilizer use. Many areas lack seeds, but as long as the transfer work is stepped up and farmers are mobilized to adjust each other, it is not difficult to solve.

In practical work, we should look forward instead of looking backward. We should consider whether the existing preparatory work can guarantee the realization of this year's production increase plan, and we should not be satisfied with the status quo simply because this year's preparatory work is better than in previous years. We should discover and face up to the various problems existing in spring plowing and take immediate action to solve these problems. We should not be satisfied with having made arrangements and held meetings, and we should not be intoxicated by existing successes and relax our efforts on current tasks. During the high tide of the cooperative movement, county and district cadres were enthusiastic, worked hard, and went deep. They worked tenaciously and specifically with the farmers, which was an important reason for the rapid and healthy development of the cooperative movement. However, recently, some people have been satisfied with the existing achievements, mistakenly believing that with cooperativization, everything will come naturally. They have returned from the cooperatives to their offices, reduced their interest in various problems in practical work, and as a result, spring plowing production has fallen into a state of lack of leadership. Since the Spring Festival, the Zhaodong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Heilongjiang has continuously participated in various meetings in the county, and no one has gone to the countryside; many farmers in Zhaodong County still do not know the "National Agricultural Development Program" (draft). The various practical problems they encounter in spring plowing production are naturally even more difficult to solve. Everyone think about it, this is such a dangerous phenomenon!

Comrade Mao Zedong, in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," called on cadres at all levels to go deep among the masses, discover problems and solve them in a timely manner, and give concrete and in-depth guidance to the movement. The same should be done in spring plowing production. The various specific problems that occur in spring plowing production must be specifically solved, such as production arrangements, labor organization, the supply of urgently needed means of production, the transmission of urgently needed technology, and so on. In order to solve these problems in a timely manner, responsible cadres at the county and district levels should go deep into the countryside. The Shuangfeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province left a deputy secretary to maintain the work of the office, while the remaining cadres went to the countryside to inspect the spring plowing situation and help farmers solve various problems on the spot. In just a few days, they discovered many serious problems that could not be discovered in the office at all. They saw that many agricultural production cooperatives had "two sets" of increase production "indicators": one set was the "advanced" indicators reported to the higher authorities, and the other set was the "actual" indicators assigned to the members, and the two indicators sometimes differed by half. They saw that many cooperatives lacked fertilizer, lacked seeds, and had poor labor organization... They immediately set about solving these problems. In Cifeng Township, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, it was originally planned to use 4,000 workdays to repair a water conservancy project, but 3,500 workdays had already been used, and only half of it had been repaired. Ge Ruosong, the secretary of the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, discovered this problem when he went to the village, helped the farmers to set a method of payment by piece, corrected the deviation of unreasonable labor remuneration, the work efficiency of the farmers almost doubled, and the project, which was expected to be completed in another thirteen days, could be completed in six days. This practice of drawing a certain number of cadres, especially leading cadres, to personally go to the countryside, help a place, or a township or a cooperative to solve problems, and drawing experience to promote the overall situation, should be imitated everywhere.

The broad masses of peasants warmly demand to overfulfill the production increase plan. Although there are many problems in spring plowing production, the conditions for solving the problems exist. Everything is ready, and all that is needed is a gust of east wind. This east wind is the specific leadership of rural cadres at all levels over spring plowing production. Hurry up and go deep, give the peasants concrete and practical help, and strive to win another great victory in agricultural production on the basis of agricultural cooperativization.

### 加强对春耕的具体领导

    加强对春耕的具体领导
    谈起今年的春耕种植任务，人们首先想到的是各种各样的有利条件：合作化运动的伟大成就，群众生产情绪的空前高涨，备耕工作的巨大成绩等等。这些都是事实。这是千百万农民在党的教育和领导下取得的伟大胜利，是今年广阔地开展农业增产运动的一个重要因素。
    可是，今年的春耕生产是不是已经没有什么问题了呢？当然不是这样。就全国绝大部分地区来说，基本上实现农业合作化还为时不久，多数农村工作干部和农业生产合作社的干部还缺乏领导集体形式的大规模生产的经验，缺乏解决各种新的经济问题和技术问题的办法。全国大部地区，从去年秋冬以来，雨雪相当稀少，虽然得了一两场春雨，但是旱象并未解除。某些地区已经是“十塘九干”不能播种了。因为种种原因，耕牛体质瘦弱的现象相当普遍。各地积攒的肥料数量都比往年多，但质量多数不如往年。在全国范围内调运的种籽数量比往年多，但因播种任务比往年大，许多地区还嫌数量不够，若干地区推广双轮双（单）铧犁的进度缓慢，小农具又不足用。训练各种技术骨干的工作，各地的进度极不平衡，个别地区还有自流松懈现象。
    任何人都会明白：现在提出这些问题，绝不是说今年的生产条件和今年的备耕工作不如往年好；而是为了说明，要完成今年的比往年高得多的农业增产任务，在绝大多数地区，还必须在已有的备耕工作的基础上，继续进行极大的努力。今年全国的种植面积比去年大约增加了九千多万亩，每一个农村工作人员都应该考虑一下，对于新增加的这个巨大的种植任务，是不是都有把握很好地完成？有些地区，备耕工作虽比往年要好，但是并不能满足今年的需要。像沈阳郊区西拉拉屯，今年积的粪肥比去年增加一半，但是今年的生产计划却比去年高两倍多，现有的肥料当然是不够用的。有些地区的备耕工作做的确实很好，但是发生了新问题。广东省在去年冬季和今年春季积肥三十五亿多担，这是一个很大的成绩。到三月中旬，有一半肥料已经送到地里，还有一半没有送。他们计算，以每人每天挑二十担计，还要有四百多万个劳动力，连续工作二十天才能送完。今年春季新增加了许多工作，没有加倍的努力，怎样能够完成呵！
    现在提出这些问题，会不会把某些人吓倒了呢？应该说，只要挺起身来，和困难作坚毅的斗争，各种问题都是可以解决的。解决这些问题的关键，就在于深入下去，加强具体领导。这不仅可以及时地发现工作中的薄弱环节和困难问题，更重要的是可以在群众的生产实践中，发现克服各种薄弱环节和解决各种困难问题的先进经验。比如：春季的干旱经常威胁着我国南北地区的插秧播种，湖北省许多地区的农民采用抗旱育种的办法，已经把当地的干旱战胜了。耕畜缺乏经常影响播种工作的进度，四川夹江县实行区、乡、社之间互助调剂的办法，全县缺乏耕牛的问题基本上解决了。肥料不够，可以把现有的肥料用作基肥，再抓紧时间赶制追肥，并且推广经济用肥的经验。许多地区缺少种籽，只要加紧调运工作，并发动农民互相调剂，也是不难解决的。
    在实际工作当中，应该向前看，而不应该向后看。要考虑已有的备耕工作能不能够保证实现今年的增产计划，而不要只看到今年的备耕工作比往年作得好因而就满足现状了。应该发现和正视春耕中存在的各种问题，立即行动起来解决这些问题，而不要满足于已经做好了部署和开好了会议，更不要为已有的成功所陶醉，放松了对于当前任务的努力。在合作化运动高潮中，县、区干部都是兴奋的、艰苦的、深入的，他们和农民在一起，进行了顽强的和具体的工作，这是合作化运动迅速、健康发展的一个重要原因。但是，最近一个时期，有些人满足于已有的成绩，误认为有了合作化就自自然然地有了一切，从合作社回到办公室中，对实际工作中的各种问题减低兴趣，结果使春耕生产陷于缺乏领导的状态。黑龙江中共肇东县委自从春节以来，连续在县里参加各种会议，没有一个人下过乡；肇东县许多农民到现在还不知道“全国农业发展纲要”（草案），他们在春耕生产中遇到的种种实际问题，自然更不容易得到解决了。大家想想，这是多么危险的现象！
    毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中，要求各级干部深入群众，发现问题及时解决，给运动以具体、深入的指导。在春耕生产中，同样应该这样作。对春耕生产中所发生的各个具体问题，必须加以具体的解决，例如生产安排问题，劳动组织问题，急需的生产资料的供应问题，急需的技术的传授问题等等。为了及时解决这些问题，县区负责干部应该深入到乡间去。中共湖南双峰县委留下副书记坚持机关工作，其余干部少数下乡检查春耕状况，就地帮助农民解决各种问题。仅仅几天的工夫，就发现了许多在办公室里根本不能发现的严重问题。他们看到许多农业生产合作社的“两套”增产“指标”：一套是向上级报告的“先进”指标，一套是向社员布置任务的“实际”指标，两种指标有的竟相差一半。他们看见许多合作社的肥料不够、种籽缺乏、劳动组织不好……他们立即着手解决了这些问题。浙江诸暨县次峰乡原计划用四千个工修好一项水利工程，已经用了三千五百个工，仅仅修了一半。中共区委书记葛若松到村里发现了这个问题，帮助农民定出按件计酬的办法，纠正了劳动报酬不合理的偏向，农民的工作效率几乎提高了半倍，预计再用十三天完成的工程，六天就可以完成了。这种抽出一定数量的干部，特别是领导干部，亲自下乡，帮助一个地方，或者一乡、一社解决问题，吸取经验推动全面的作法，各地是应该仿效的。
    广大农民热烈要求超额完成增产计划，春耕生产中问题虽然不少，但解决问题的条件是存在着的。万事全都准备好了，还需要有一场东风，这场东风就是各级农村干部对春耕生产的具体领导。赶快深入下去，给农民以具体、切实的帮助，争取在农业合作化的基础上，再打一个农业生产的大胜仗。
