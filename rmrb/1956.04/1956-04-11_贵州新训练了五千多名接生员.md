　　Since mid-February, Guizhou Province has trained more than five thousand new-method midwives. Adding these to the original six thousand six hundred, the province now has more than eleven thousand midwives, one-third of whom are ethnic minority women. In Huishui and Lushan, two autonomous counties for ethnic minorities, forty-two midwifery stations have been established, and many ethnic minority women have come to understand the benefits of new-method midwifery.

　　The province plans to train 20,000 midwives this year, aiming to have midwifery stations in every township, with the requirement that more than 90% of women in labor use the new method of delivery.

    贵州新训练了五千多名接生员
    二月中旬以来，贵州省各地训练了五千多名新法接生员，加上原有的六千六百名，全省已经有一万一千多名接生员，其中少数民族妇女占三分之一。惠水、炉山两个民族自治县，已建立了四十二个接生站，许多少数民族妇女都懂得了新法接生的好处。
    全省计划今年训练两万名接生员，达到乡乡有接生站，要求90％以上的产妇用新法接生。
