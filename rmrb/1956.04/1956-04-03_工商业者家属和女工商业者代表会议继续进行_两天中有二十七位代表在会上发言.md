Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - The National Conference of Industrialist and Businessmen's Families and Female Industrialist and Businessmen Representatives, after group discussions on the afternoon of March 30th and 31st, held plenary sessions for speeches on the afternoon of April 1st and 2nd. Twenty-four wives of heads of diplomatic missions to China from fifteen countries in Asia and Europe successively attended the opening ceremony and today's general assembly.

Of the twenty-seven representatives who spoke over these two days, most were from industrialist and businessman families from all over the country, representing various industries. The representatives spoke from their personal experiences about the bright future that the Party and the government's socialist transformation policies for private industry and commerce had brought them. They also expressed that they would work hard to transform themselves in the future, strive to be active participants in the socialist transformation cause, and advance towards socialism together with the people of the whole country. Yang Qishu, a representative from Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, spoke about the process of her personal and family progress. Yang Qishu's husband, Huang Ming'an, ran the Jufu Foreign Firm and the Sancaisheng Coal Mine, which were forced into bankruptcy before liberation due to oppression by imperialist forces and competition from capitalists. The remaining Qianghua Company had liabilities exceeding assets after liberation due to consistently poor management. Therefore, in 1952, they applied for joint public-private ownership. After Qianghua Company was approved for joint public-private ownership, Huang Ming'an became the deputy manager of the newly formed joint public-private ownership Sichuan River Shipping Company, and is gradually transforming into a self-reliant laborer. Yang Qishu's eldest son has also become frugal and simple after liberation, and has become a state cadre. Her two younger children, one working in the Northeast and one studying at a university in Beijing, have both become members of the Communist Youth League. Rong Muwen, a representative from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, spoke about how she and her husband, Li Guowei, had doubts about the Communist Party on the eve of liberation and moved from Hankou to Hong Kong, and how they gradually understood the true situation of New China, returned to Wuhan from Hong Kong, and how they improved their understanding and voluntarily requested the implementation of joint public-private ownership for six factories including textiles, power generation, and machinery. Zhang Biaoxiu, a representative from Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, introduced how she helped her husband progress and encouraged her husband to accept the socialist transformation of enterprises after participating in neighborhood work and revolutionary work. He Yuxing, a representative from Chongqing, actively participated in social work and patiently and meticulously persuaded her husband to apply for joint public-private ownership of enterprises during the high tide of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce throughout the country. Yang Jianqing, a representative from Shanghai and the wife of Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said at the conference today that for the happiness of her children and grandchildren, she would follow the Communist Party on the road to socialism together with the people of the whole country.

Some female industrialists and businesswomen who spoke at the meeting talked about how they actively accepted socialist transformation and improved the management of their enterprises. Yu Baochen, a representative of female industrialists and businesswomen from Guangxi Province, often studied business management methods with workers after the joint operation of the enterprise, and often assisted workers in preparing medicines, which greatly increased the turnover. Pang Huaqi, the manager of Jiansheng Store in Guangdong Province, actively worked with workers to improve technology in production, enabling the small store she managed to gradually develop into machine production, and together with the workers successfully trial-produced a new product that uses paper cores instead of wood cores - waxed thread balls. Lang Jifang, a chemical technician and capitalist employee of Shanghai Shengji Pharmaceutical Chemical Factory, proposed with her husband that they would research and develop five new products within a year after the enterprise implemented joint public-private ownership, and also prepare to research shortening the production process of Vitamin K.

Huang Zhi, a representative from Beijing, and Wang Zhengxuan, a representative from Shanghai, introduced the situation and experience of organizing local industrialist and businessman families to study at the meeting. They stated that they would unite more industrialist and businessman families to participate in learning, improve their awareness, and contribute to the socialist transformation cause in the future.
