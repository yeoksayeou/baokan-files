    Lloyd Cannot Justify Himself

    On March 28th, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd made a poor sophistry in Parliament. He said that Britain's sending the Chiang Kai-shek group's pilots back to Taiwan was "correct."

    As everyone knows, the Chiang Kai-shek group's warplanes were harassing the Chinese mainland when they were pursued by our air defense forces and fled to Hong Kong. The British authorities' sending the Chiang Kai-shek group's pilots back to Taiwan has in effect allowed Hong Kong to be used as a military base against the People's Republic of China. This is an extremely unfriendly act towards the People's Republic of China.

    Lloyd now argues that the reason the British government took this action is that Britain does not recognize a state of war between the People's Republic of China and the Chiang Kai-shek group. According to Lloyd, this indicates that the British government does not deny a universally recognized principle of international law, namely that when an armed rebellion occurs in a country, the third country government should not support the rebels.

    Now, Lloyd says verbally that the British government recognizes this principle; but in action, it turns Hong Kong into a haven for the Chiang Kai-shek group's military personnel. This puts him in an extreme logical contradiction.

    The difficulty with Lloyd's defense also lies in the fact that the government of the People's Republic of China is the legitimate government recognized by the British government. Since the Chiang Kai-shek group has no legal status in this matter, what reason does the British government have to send the pilots back to Taiwan? How does Lloyd explain the obligations that the British government undertakes under international law?

    It is very clear that the British government's handling of the Chiang Kai-shek group's pilots is a blatant violation of recognized international law principles and a blatant infringement on China's sovereignty. The more one defends this incident, the more clearly it will expose the British government's arrogance.

### 劳埃德不能自圆其说

    劳埃德不能自圆其说
    三月二十八日，英国外交大臣劳埃德在国会中作了一次不高明的诡辩。他说：英国把蒋介石集团的驾驶员送回台湾，这是“正确的”。
    大家知道，蒋介石集团的作战飞机，是在骚扰中国大陆时，被我空防部队追击而逃到香港的。英国当局把蒋介石集团驾驶员送回台湾，已使香港在事实上被利用来作为反对中华人民共和国的军事基地。这是对中华人民共和国极不友好的行动。
    劳埃德现在强辩说，英国政府采取这样行动的理由是，英国并不承认中华人民共和国和蒋介石集团之间存在着交战状态。根据劳埃德的说法，表示英国政府并不否认这样一个众所公认的国际法准则，即：当一国发生武装叛乱的时候，第三国政府不对叛乱分子予以支持。
    现在，劳埃德在口头上说，英国政府承认这一原则；而在行动上，却又把香港变为蒋介石集团军事人员的庇护所。这就使得他在逻辑上陷于极端矛盾的地步。
    劳埃德的辩解的难以成立，还在于：中华人民共和国政府是英国政府承认了的合法政府。既然蒋介石集团在这一事件中没有任何的法律地位，那么英国政府有什么理由把驾驶员送回到台湾去？劳埃德对于英国政府在国际法上所承担的义务，又作怎样的解释？
    十分明显，英国政府对蒋介石集团驾驶员的处理，是明目张胆地破坏了公认的国际法准则，公然损害中国的主权。对这一事件愈是进行辩解，只能愈是清楚地暴露英国政府的狂悖。
