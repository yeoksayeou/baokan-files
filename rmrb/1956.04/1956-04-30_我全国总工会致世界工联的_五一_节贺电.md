Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' congratulatory message to the World Federation of Trade Unions on "May Day". The full text is as follows: Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions:

    On the occasion of the great "May Day" International Labor Day, I, on behalf of the Chinese workers, extend warm congratulations to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the banner of international trade union solidarity.

    Since its establishment, the World Federation of Trade Unions has carried out unyielding struggles to defend the interests of working people all over the world, and therefore enjoys great prestige among workers in various countries and is supported by them. Any conspiracy by the enemies of the working class to slander and undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions is bound to be completely defeated. I wish the World Federation of Trade Unions further achievements in its struggle to strive for international trade union unity, improve the living and working conditions of workers, respect trade union rights, fight for the independence of oppressed people, and defend world peace.

            All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                April 29th

    值此伟大的“五一”国际劳动节之际，谨代表中国工人向国际工会团结的旗帜——世界工会联合会致以热烈的祝贺。
    世界工联自成立以来，为保卫全世界劳动人民的利益进行了不屈不挠的斗争，因而在各国工人中享有巨大的威信并得到他们的拥护。工人阶级的敌人对世界工联进行污蔑和破坏的任何阴谋势必遭到完全的失败。谨祝世界工联在争取国际工会的团结、改善工人的生活和劳动条件，尊重工会权利，争取被压迫人民的独立和保卫世界和平的斗争中，获得进一步的成就。
