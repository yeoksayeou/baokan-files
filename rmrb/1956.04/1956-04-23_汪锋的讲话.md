Comrades, Friends, Fellow Committee Members:

    The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is now established, and I wholeheartedly congratulate the meeting on its success. This time, I am able to participate in the central delegation and have the opportunity to meet with the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and friends from Tibet in Lhasa, and I feel extremely happy and honored in my heart.

    The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is not only a major event in the history of Tibet but also a major event for the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Its establishment will promote greater unity within Tibet and will also promote the further development of Tibet's political, economic, and cultural undertakings, which will create favorable conditions for the early establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have become increasingly closely united. In the past six or seven years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, we have correctly implemented the policy of equality among nationalities and freedom of religious belief. We have carried out a great deal of work in promoting national regional autonomy, training ethnic minority cadres, and developing the economy and culture of ethnic minorities, thereby enabling all ethnic minorities in our country to achieve great progress and development. During this period, the face of the Tibetan region has also undergone significant changes. This is primarily manifested in the unprecedented strengthening of unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within Tibet itself. Secondly, Tibet's political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings have also made a good start. This is the result of the efforts of the Tibetan people under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibet Work Committee, as well as the joint efforts of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet and the working personnel stationed in Tibet.

    The development and progress of all aspects of the Tibetan region are of extremely great significance to the socialist construction cause of the motherland. In order to further develop Tibet and the motherland's construction cause and further strengthen the unity between all ethnic groups in our country, especially between the Tibetan and Han nationalities, as well as within Tibet, it is extremely important. The increasing unity of all ethnic groups in our country is precisely the source of our country's invincible strength. To this end, our country's constitution clearly stipulates that "All nationalities are equal. Discrimination against and oppression of any nationality are prohibited, and acts that undermine the unity of all nationalities are prohibited."

    Chairman Mao has also repeatedly taught us that all ethnic groups in China must unite, and both large and small ethnic groups must unite. As long as they are Chinese, regardless of ethnicity, all who oppose imperialism and love the motherland, we must unite with them. Unite, work according to the different situations of each ethnic group, and jointly seek progress and development. This means that the unity of all ethnic groups in our country is fraternal unity. The basis of this unity is national equality. The purpose of unity is to oppose imperialism and build our common socialist family of the motherland. Regarding unity within Tibet, Chairman Mao has also pointed out: To achieve genuine unity within Tibet, it is necessary to thoroughly address unresolved issues with a spirit of mutual trust, mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual compromise. The above-mentioned constitutional provisions and Chairman Mao's instructions are of particularly profound significance for the future development of Tibetan work.

    The Tibetan region is vast and rich in resources, and its future is very bright. Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, further unite, help each other, and support each other, and strive together to build a beautiful Tibet Autonomous Region and a prosperous and happy family of all ethnic groups in our motherland who love each other and cooperate!

    Long live the great unity of all nationalities!

    汪锋的讲话
    各位委员、各位朋友、各位同志：
    西藏自治区筹备委员会现在宣告成立了，我衷心地祝贺会议的成功。这次，我能够参加中央代表团，有机会在拉萨和达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼以及西藏的各位朋友见面，内心感到极大的愉快和荣幸。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，不仅是西藏历史上的一件大事，也是全国各民族人民的一件大事。它的成立将促使西藏内部更加团结，同时也将促使西藏的政治、经济和文化事业得到进一步的发展，这就可以为早日建立西藏自治区创造有利的条件。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，我国各民族人民已经日益紧密地团结起来了。六、七年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的领导下，我们正确地执行了民族平等和宗教信仰自由政策，在推行民族区域自治，培养民族干部和发展少数民族经济和文化等各方面，进行了许多的工作，从而使我国各少数民族都得到了很大的进步和发展。在此期间，西藏地区的面貌也有了显著的改变。这首先表现在汉藏民族和西藏内部的团结空前地加强了，其次是西藏的政治、经济和文化的建设事业，也有了一个良好的开端。这是西藏人民在中国共产党、毛主席和达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、西藏工委正确领导下努力的结果，也是中国人民解放军进藏部队、进藏工作人员共同努力的结果。
    西藏地区各方面的发展和进步，对祖国社会主义的建设事业有着极为重大的意义。为使西藏和祖国建设事业的更加发展，进一步加强我国各民族之间，特别是藏族和汉族之间以及西藏内部的团结，是十分重要的。我国各民族的日益团结，正是我们国家不可战胜的力量泉源。为此，我国的宪法曾明确地规定了“各民族一律平等。禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为。”
    毛主席也曾经多次教导我们，中国各民族要团结起来，不论大的民族、小的民族都要团结。只要是中国人，不分民族，凡是反对帝国主义，爱护祖国的，我们都要和他们团结。团结起来，按照各民族的不同情况，进行工作，共同求得进步和发展。这就是说，我国各民族的团结是兄弟般的团结。这种团结的基础是民族平等。团结的目的是反对帝国主义，建设我们共同的社会主义的祖国大家庭。关于西藏内部的团结，毛主席也曾经指出：要达到西藏内部的真正团结，必需要以互相信任、互相尊重、互相谅解、互相让步的精神，来彻底处理未解决的问题。以上引述的宪法规定，和毛主席的指示，对于今后西藏工作的开展，是具有特殊深刻的意义的。
    西藏地区广大，资源丰富，它的前途非常光明。让我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，更进一步地团结起来，互相帮助，互相支援，为建设美好的西藏自治区，为建设我们繁荣幸福的各民族友爱合作的祖国大家庭共同奋斗！
    各民族大团结万岁！
