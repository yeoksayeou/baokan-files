    Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries Production Construction
    Soviet Union's Grand Plan to Train Highly Specialized Personnel
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS reports: During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Soviet higher education institutions will double the number of specialized personnel trained for heavy industry, transportation, construction, and agriculture. Universities and colleges will train at least 1.5 million young specialists over the five years.
    Currently, there are 193 higher technical schools in the Soviet Union with approximately 650,000 students. These schools train engineers in 200 different specialties.
    Due to the rapid growth of the national economy in the Urals, Siberia, Kazakhstan, and other regions, directly training highly specialized personnel in the eastern regions has become the most important task of the new Five-Year Plan. Over the five years, higher education institutions there will train 500,000 specialists, about one-third of the Soviet Union's total. Many new school buildings are being built there. In the suburbs of Khabarovsk, a large university district will be built, housing a Forestry Technical College, a Highway College, and a Construction Engineering College. In Irkutsk, three new colleges are also being built: a Construction Engineering College, a Comprehensive Technical College, and a Metallurgical College. Construction will also begin this year on a Mining and Metallurgical College in Alma-Ata and a Comprehensive Technical College in Frunze.
    The Soviet Union's night school and correspondence school education are very large in scale. By 1960, the number of students in night universities and correspondence universities will reach one million.
    
    Korea Successfully Completes First Quarter Plan
    The Korean working people have victoriously completed the first quarter plan of 1956 – the final year of the post-war national economic recovery and development Three-Year Plan.
    According to materials compiled by the Central Statistical Bureau of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in the first quarter of this year, the total production plan of state-owned and cooperative-run industries was completed by 109%. The total industrial output in the first quarter of this year increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
    In the first quarter of this year, more than 80 large enterprises and factories have already achieved the three-year targets for the output of various products ahead of schedule.
    In the first quarter of this year, labor productivity in the industrial sector increased by 21% compared to the same period last year. The production cost of all industrial products was reduced by 8.4% compared to the average production cost last year.
    In addition, large-scale capital construction in various sectors of the national economy is also underway in the first quarter of this year. There are more than 40 major projects to be constructed. A large amount of investment will be made in these projects throughout the year.
    In the first quarter of this year, the funds invested in capital construction in agriculture increased by 14% compared with the same period last year. In particular, large-scale irrigation projects are being completed quickly according to the targets, such as the second phase of the South Pyongan Province irrigation project and the irrigation project in the Sunghori area.
    The Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have continued to adopt appropriate measures to promote the rapid development of agriculture.
    The socialist economy in the rural economy is being further consolidated. By the end of March 1956, there were 14,738 intermediate and advanced agricultural production cooperatives, an increase of 2,606 from the end of 1955. By the end of March 1956, agricultural production cooperatives had absorbed 68.3% of all peasant households and 65.5% of the land area cultivated by cooperatives and individual farmers.
    In the first quarter, domestic commodity circulation and foreign trade also further developed. The commodity circulation plan for state-owned and cooperative trade was completed by 103%, and the state-owned trade plan was completed by 107%. The total volume of foreign trade increased by 12% compared to the first quarter of last year.
    The brilliant achievements made by all sectors of the national economy in the first quarter, as well as the active struggle of all working people, will certainly enable the Three-Year Plan to be completed ahead of schedule.
    
    Technical Achievements of Industrial Sectors in Democratic Germany
    The various industrial sectors of the German Democratic Republic have made great technical achievements in development. The state-owned "Henry Pels" Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Erfurt is producing a new type of 1,600-ton forging press designed by its own designers. The Transportation Equipment and Hoisting Machinery Factory is producing new loading and unloading and transport machines, as well as cranes with a lifting capacity of 40 tons for the construction industry. The machine tool manufacturing industry has designed automatic lathes, on which labor productivity can be increased fivefold compared to working on ordinary lathes.
    The "Zeiss" enterprise in Jena has manufactured a series of new and unique optical instruments, including a reflecting telescope with a diameter of 1.2 meters and an electron microscope.
    Recently, the German Democratic Republic has also designed electronic computers and improved accounting computers, as well as other machines.
    In order to peacefully utilize atomic energy in the republic, the construction of a nuclear research center has begun. Atomic power plants will be built in the second Five-Year Plan.
    
    Hungary Exceeds First Quarter Production Plan
    The Hungarian Central Statistical Office published on April 21 a communique on the implementation of the 1956 National Economic Development Plan for the first quarter.
    The communique said that despite some difficulties caused by bad weather and the flooding of the Danube, the socialist industrial sector as a whole completed 107.7% of the first quarter plan. The total output of socialist industry increased by 5.1% compared to the first quarter of 1955.
    In agriculture, due to the late arrival of spring this year, spring plowing began much later than usual. In the first quarter, agriculture received more machinery. As of April 1, the total number of tractors was 5,000 more than in the spring of 1955, and there were 3,200 more tractor-drawn plows.
    In the first quarter, 154 new agricultural production cooperatives and 36 production cooperative groups were established nationwide. 35,000 peasant households joined cooperative organizations, two and a half times the number in the first quarter of last year. The number of livestock nationwide increased compared to the same period last year.
    The communique concluded by saying that the Hungarian population increased by 20,000 in the first quarter, and by the end of March, the total population of the country exceeded 9.8 million.
    
    Bulgaria's Animal Husbandry Develops Rapidly
    In the past eleven years, the number of cattle in Bulgaria has increased by 16%, sheep by 21.6%, pigs have doubled, and poultry has more than doubled.
    With the consolidation and development of the agricultural production cooperative system, publicly owned animal husbandry has achieved significant development. Now, almost all agricultural production cooperatives and state farms in Bulgaria have established dairy farms, sheep farms, pig farms, and poultry farms, and many state farms also have horse farms.
    In the past three years, the average milk yield per dairy cow has almost tripled. The average wool yield per sheep in agricultural production cooperatives has exceeded two kilograms in the past two years.
    
    Albania's Agricultural Cooperation Movement Develops Rapidly
    The number of agricultural production cooperatives in Albania has now increased to 630, reaching the target set by the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party for the end of this year, about double the number at the end of last year.
    As of March 15, the number of farmers participating in cooperatives accounted for 12.8% of the total number of peasant households in the country, and the land of cooperatives accounted for 17.2% of the country's cultivated land. In some areas, more than 70% of the cultivated land has been collectivized.
    The rapid development of Albania's agricultural cooperation movement this year is inseparable from the achievements made by agricultural production cooperatives last year. In 1955, cooperatives harvested an average of 29% more wheat per hectare than individual farmers, 57.7% more cotton, and 102.7% more beets. Last year, the in-kind income of cooperative members per labor day increased by 19% compared to 1954, and cash income increased by 36%.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生产建设
    苏联培养高等专门人才的巨大计划
    新华社讯  据塔斯社报道：苏联高等学校在第六个五年计划期间为重工业、运输业、建筑业、农业培养的专门人才将增加一倍。各高等学校在五年中至少要培养一百五十万青年专门人才。
    目前，苏联有一百九十三个高等技术学校，拥有学生约六十五万名。这些学校里培养着两百种专业的工程师。
    由于乌拉尔、西伯利亚、哈萨克等地国民经济的迅速增长，直接在东部地区培养高等专门人才成了新五年计划的最重大的任务。五年中那里的高等学校培养的专门人才将达五十万人，约为全苏联的三分之一。许多新校舍正在那里建筑起来。在伯力郊区，将要兴建一个巨大的大学区，这里将有林业技术学院、公路学院和建筑工程学院。伊尔库次克也在建设三个新的学院：建筑工程学院、综合技术学院和冶金学院。今年还要开始在阿拉木图建设一所矿冶学院，在伏龙芝建设一所综合技术学院。
    苏联的夜校和函授学校教育的规模很大。到1960年，夜大学和函授大学的学生人数将达到一百万人。
    朝鲜胜利完成第一季度计划
    朝鲜劳动人民胜利地完成了1956年——战后国民经济恢复和发展三年计划的最后一年——的第一季度计划。
    根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家计划委员会中央统计局汇集的材料，在今年第一季度中，国营工业和合作社营工业的全部生产计划完成了109％。今年第一季度的工业总产量比去年同一时期增加了31％。
    在今年第一季度中，有八十多个大企业和大工厂已经提前完成各项产品的产量的三年目标。
    在今年第一季度内，工业方面的劳动生产率比去年同一时期提高了21％。全部工业产品的生产费用比去年平均生产费用降低8.4％。
    此外，在今年第一季度内，国民经济各个部门的基本建设也在大规模地进行。要建设的主要工程有四十多项。在今年一年内，在这些工程上将有大量投资。
    今年第一季度，投资在农业方面的基本建设中的资金和去年同时期比较，增加了14％。特别是大规模灌溉工程都正在赶快完成指标，例如平安南道灌溉工程的第二阶段工程和胜湖里地区的灌溉工程。
    朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再接再厉地采取了促进农业迅速发展的适当措施。
    农村经济中的社会主义经济在进一步巩固。到1956年3月底为止，中级和高级的农业生产合作社达到14，738个，比1955年年底增加了2，606个。到1956年3月底为止，农业生产合作社已经吸收了全部农户的68.3％和合作及个体耕作的土地面积的65.5％。
    在第一季度中，国内商品流转和对外贸易也有进一步的发展。国营和合作社贸易的商品流转计划完成了103％，国营贸易计划完成了107％。对外贸易总额比去年第一季度增加了12％。
    国民经济的一切部门在第一季度取得的辉煌成就，以及全体劳动人民的积极斗争，将使三年计划一定能够提前完成。
    民主德国工业部门的技术成就
    德意志民主共和国各工业部门在发展中取得了巨大的技术成就。欧法特的国营“亨利·佩尔茨”重型机器制造厂正在出产本企业设计师所设计的一种一千六百吨的新型压锻机。运输装备和起重机械工厂正在生产新的装卸和运输机器，以及供建筑工业用的起重量为四十吨的起重机。机床制造工业设计出了自动旋床，在这种旋床上工作比在普通旋床上工作的劳动生产率可以提高五倍。
    耶纳的“蔡斯”企业制造了一系列新的独特的光学仪器，其中有直径为一点二公尺的反射望远镜和电子显微镜。
    最近，德意志民主共和国又设计出了电子计算机和改良的会计计算机以及其他机器。
    为了在共和国中和平利用原子能，已经开始建筑核子研究中心。在第二个五年计划中将建筑原子发电站。
    匈超额完成第一季度生产计划
    匈牙利中央统计局在四月二十一日发表了1956年国民经济发展计划第一季度执行情况的公报。
    公报说，尽管由于气候不好和多瑙河的洪水所造成的某些困难，但是社会主义工业部门整个说来还是完成了第一季度计划的107.7％。社会主义工业总产量比1955年第一季度增加了5.1％。
    在农业方面，今年由于春天来得迟，春耕工作开始得比平常晚得多。在第一季中，农业得到了更多的机器。截至四月一日为止，拖拉机总数比1955年春季多五千台，拖拉机曳引犁多三千二百部。
    在第一季中，全国成立了一百五十四个新的农业生产合作社和三十六个生产合作组。有三万五千个农户参加了合作社组织，这个数目为去年第一季度的两倍半。全国牲畜头数比去年同期有了增加。
    公报最后说，匈牙利人口在第一季度增加了二万人，到三月底，全国人口总数超过了九百八十万。
    保加利亚畜牧业发展迅速
    在过去十一年中，保加利亚的牛的头数增加了16％，羊增加了21.6％，猪增加了一倍，家禽增加了一倍多。
    随着农业生产合作社制度的巩固和发展，公有饲畜业获得了显著的发展。现在，保加利亚几乎所有的农业生产合作社和国营农场都已经建立了奶牛场、养羊场、养猪场和养禽场，许多国营农场还有养马场。
    在最近三年中，每头奶牛的平均挤奶量差不多增加了两倍。农业生产合作社每只羊的平均剪毛量在过去两年中都超过了两公斤。
    阿农业合作化运动发展迅速
    阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产合作社现在已经增加到六百三十个，达到了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会所规定的今年年底的指标，比去年年底增加了一倍左右。
    到三月十五日截止，参加合作社的农民已经占全国农户总数的12.8％，合作社的土地占全国耕地的17.2％。在某些地区，已经有70％以上的耕地合作化了。
    今年阿尔巴尼亚农业合作化运动的迅速发展是和农业生产合作社在去年取得的成就分不开的。1955年，合作社每公顷土地所收的小麦平均比个体农民多29％，棉花多57.7％，甜菜多102.7％。去年合作社员每一个劳动日的实物收入比1954年增加了19％，现金收入增加了36％。
