    In a Village in Hebei
    By Our Correspondent He Li
    The spring breeze swept across the Hebei Plain. In Nanloudi Village, Anguo County, I followed a line of carts hauling manure towards the fields. The manure piles in the fields were densely packed, forty carts per mu. Within an area of sixty square zhang, there was an average of one manure pile per one and a half square zhang. How could this not be exciting! A farmer driving a cart told me: in the past, when we were still farming individually, how could any family have applied so much manure! In the past, a family with more than ten mu of land would not accumulate even thirty to fifty carts of manure in a year. Dry land usually received no manure at all, only paddy fields received manure, and even then, only three to five or seven to eight carts. Since the establishment of the advanced cooperative last year, people have been even more motivated than they were in the mutual aid teams and elementary cooperatives. Last winter, the cooperative launched a manure accumulation campaign, and all sources of fertilizer in the whole cooperative were tapped. The old kangs in the homes were all dismantled and replaced with new ones. The “thousand-foot mud” on the streets was all shoveled up, and the pit mud in front of and behind the village was all dug out. In order to improve the quality of the manure and increase the source of fertilizer, the cooperative specially sent people to transport coal to exchange for firewood from the members for high-temperature composting. Even the old shoe soles that people used to wear were used as fertilizer. This farmer told me with great excitement that the brand new cooperative had accumulated more than 1.7 million carts of fertilizer, averaging more than forty carts per mu! This guarantees a bumper harvest of grain this year.
    I walked along the main road in front of the village to a field of barley, where a production team was planting spring barley. I asked a farmer wielding a three-pronged hoe, "What is the contracted yield for your barley?" He replied decisively, "Nine hundred and fifty jin." His tone was so firm. A farmer next to him explained to me that the cooperative contracted them for six hundred jin, but they themselves had set a target of nine hundred and fifty jin. I asked, "Can such a high yield be achieved?" This farmer, wielding the three-pronged hoe without stopping, said with a smile, "Look how much manure we've applied!" I looked into the field and saw that it was indeed covered with a thick layer of high-temperature fertilizer and compost. In addition, there were two large bags of crushed soybean cake powder placed next to the ridges. With sufficient water and fertilizer, how could people not be full of confidence!
    I moved to the youth team's cultivation area. The youth team is a banner of the Brand New Agricultural Production Cooperative. They complete all tasks ahead of schedule and with guaranteed quality. At this time, they were repairing the ridges of the raised fields. Raised fields are an important measure for drought and flood prevention on the Hebei Plain. The crisscrossing ridges are like countless window panes, dividing a piece of land into small plots, allowing rainwater to seep into the soil within the plots, preventing it from flowing horizontally everywhere, causing river water to surge, and preventing both floods and droughts. The young people of the youth team were divided into male and female groups to build the ridges. The women organized a relay, with pairs of people throwing soil from a distance to a closer point, and then from the closer point onto the ridges. The ridges built by the youth team were of high quality. According to the requirements of the superiors, the general ridge was two chi one cun wide and one chi five cun high, but they built it five chi wide and three chi high, straight and flat. Why did they do this? It turned out that they had another plan, which was to kill two birds with one stone, using the ridges as irrigation ditches in the future, so that there would be no need to build channels when watering the cotton. When I came to visit, their raised fields were almost completed. The task assigned by the cooperative was seven days, but now they had completed it in five days.
    I turned from the fields to the village entrance and saw a group of people carrying out sweet potato seedling cultivation. There were two sweet potato kangs built on the field, with three large iron pots supported by the side of the kang. A burst of thick smoke and flames rose from under the pots. Two people carried a basket of sweet potatoes and immersed them in the pot, while one person held a thermometer and constantly checked the temperature in the pot. It turned out that they were conducting hot water seed soaking. After the sweet potato seeds were soaked, people carried them to the side of the kang, where the people on the kang checked them one by one, and any diseased areas were cut off, and some were simply picked out. Then, the seed potatoes were laid out in rows on the kang, and coal was burned under the kang to maintain the temperature inside the kang. After cooperativization, the farming methods of the peasants have also become scientific. A comrade named Song told me that they have been using hot water seed soaking and hotbed seedling cultivation methods for three years. Three years ago, when hot water seed soaking was first tried, Nanloudi Village only had small cooperatives, and he was the head of this small cooperative. At that time, the members of the cooperative watched with apprehension: soaking in boiling water (fifty-eight degrees) for ten minutes, would the seed potatoes be cooked? Of course, the masses believed in the technical personnel sent by the government, but no one had ever seen this before, so how could they rest assured? Comrade Song said that even he himself was not at ease. "When the technical personnel were soaking the seeds, I kept breaking open the sweet potatoes to look while soaking them. After the sweet potatoes were soaked and put into the kang, I went to open the kang shed every day to see if they were dead or alive, until the buds came out, then I was relieved." As he spoke, he couldn't help but laugh, and I laughed too. This shows how difficult it is to promote a new technology! Indeed, this year's sweet potato seedling cultivation also has many problems, such as some people not strictly following the operating procedures, not controlling the temperature well, and the seed potatoes being messy. However, it is worth celebrating that farmers are moving from not understanding science to using scientific methods of farming.

    在河北的一个农村里
    本报记者　贺笠
    春风吹过了河北平原。在安国县南楼底村里，我随着一列拉粪的大车走向田野。地里的粪堆堆的密密层层，一亩地四十车，在六十方丈的面积里，平均一方丈半就有一个粪堆，这怎能不叫人兴奋呢！一个赶车的农民告诉我：从前还是单干的时候，哪一家人上过这样多的粪！从前一个有十多亩地的人家，一年也不准积三五十车粪，旱地照例是一车不上的，只有水地才上粪，上粪也不过三五车、七八车。自从去年成立了高级社，人们比从前在互助组和初级社的时候，劲头更足了，去年冬季社里发起了积肥运动，全社所有的肥源都挖出来了，家里的旧炕全都拆了重换新炕，街上的千脚泥都铲了，村前村后的坑泥都挖光了，为了提高粪的质量，增加肥源，社里专门派人运煤换取社员的柴火做高温积肥，连人们过去穿的破鞋底也做了肥料，这个农民兴高采烈地告诉我，崭新社共积了一百七十多万车肥，每亩平均四十车还多呢！保证今年的粮食是要丰收的。
    我沿着村前的大道，走到一块大麦地的旁边，这里正有一个生产小组在种春大麦。我问一个拉三齿镐的农民：“你们大麦的包产是多少斤？”他斩钉截铁地回答：“九百五。”语气是那样干脆。旁边一个农民向我解释说，社里向他们队包的是六百斤，他们自己预定的是九百五十斤。我问：“这样高的产量能达到吗？”这个农民操着三齿镐，手也不停，笑眯眯地说：“你看，我们上了多少粪！”我往地里一看，果然满地里铺着很厚的高温肥和堆肥，另外畦子旁边还摆着两大口袋碾碎了的豆饼粉，真是水足粪肥，让人哪能不信心十足呢！
    我转到青年队的耕作区。青年队是崭新农业生产合作社的一面旗帜，他们样样任务都是提前完成，保质保量。这时他们正在修畦田埂。畦田是河北平原防旱防涝的一项重要措施，纵横交错的畦埂好像无数的窗格把一片大地隔成一块块畦子，使雨水就在畦子里渗进土中，不致到处横流，引起河水暴涨，既可防涝又可防旱。青年队的青年们正分成男女两组修筑畦埂，妇女们组织了接力，两人一对地由远处把土抛到近处，由近处抛上畦埂。青年队修的畦田质量很高，按上级的要求，一般畦埂是二尺一寸宽、一尺五寸高，但是他们修了五尺宽、三尺高，修得又直又平。他们为什么要这样作呢？原来他们还有另一个打算，是想就此一举两得，将来在畦埂上作灌溉渠，种棉的时候浇水就不用再修渠道了。当我来参观的时候，他们的畦田已经快完工了，社里规定的任务是七天，现在，他们五天就完成了。
    我从地里转到村头，看见一群人在那里进行甘薯育苗。场上修得有两个甘薯炕，炕边支着三口大铁锅，一阵阵的浓烟和火苗从锅下升起，两个人抬着一筐甘薯在锅里浸，一个人拿一根温度表不断在锅里检查温度，原来他们在进行温汤浸种。被浸过的甘薯种，人们又把它抬到炕边，经过炕上的人一一检查，凡是有病痕的地方都把它削去，有的干脆就把它拣出来，然后把种薯一排排地斜铺在炕上，炕的下面也烧得有煤火，以保持炕里的温度。在合作化以后，农民的耕作方法也科学化了。有一个姓宋的同志告诉我：他们采用温汤浸种和温床育苗的方法已经三年了。三年前试行温汤浸种的时候，南楼底村里还只有小社，他是这个小社的社长。当时社员们都怀着疑惧的心情观望：要用滚热的水（五十八度）浸烫十分钟，是不是会把种薯煮熟了呢？当然群众是相信政府派来的技术人员，但是谁也没见过这事，怎能就那样放心呢，这位宋同志说：就是他自己也是不放心的，“在技术人员浸种的时候，我边浸边掰开甘薯看，甘薯浸完入了炕，我还天天去打开炕篷，看到底是死了呢，还是活着，直到芽子出来我才放了心。”说着他自己不禁笑起来了，我也哈哈大笑。这说明一个新技术的推广是如何不容易呀！的确，今年的甘薯育苗也有很多问题，如有些群众并没有严格遵守操作规程，温度没有很好掌握，种薯也杂乱。但是，农民从不懂科学走向采用科学方法耕种，这是值得我们欢庆的。
