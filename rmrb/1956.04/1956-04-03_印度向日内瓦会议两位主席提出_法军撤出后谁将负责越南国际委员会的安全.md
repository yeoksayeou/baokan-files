    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 2nd. According to a news release issued by the Indian Information Bureau, the Indian government has submitted the question of who will be responsible for the security of the International Commission in Vietnam after the French troops withdraw from South Vietnam to the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference—the British Foreign Secretary and the Soviet Foreign Minister. The message said that according to the Geneva Accords on Indochina, the French army is responsible for protecting the International Commission.
    India, as the chairman of the International Commission in Vietnam, is concerned about the future situation in South Vietnam. According to the Press Trust of India, the Indian chairman of the International Commission in Vietnam, Parthasarathi, told the South Vietnamese authorities on March 26 that if the French High Command were to withdraw without deciding on its succession and its obligations under the Geneva Accords, the result would be a serious situation.

    印度向日内瓦会议两位主席提出
    法军撤出后谁将负责越南国际委员会的安全
    新华社新德里2日讯　据印度新闻局发表的消息说，印度政府已经将法军在撤离南越以后谁将负责越南国际委员会安全的问题，提交给日内瓦会议的两位主席——英国外交大臣和苏联外交部长。消息说，根据关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协定，法军负有保护国际委员会的责任。
    作为越南国际委员会的主席的印度对南越未来的局势表示关切。据印度报业托辣斯报道，越南国际委员会的印度主席帕萨塔拉蒂曾经在三月二十六日对南越当局说，如果法军最高司令部要在没有就它的后继问题和它根据日内瓦协议所承担的义务作出决定以前撤退的话，结果将会产生严重的局势。
