    I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the World Federation of Scientific Workers on behalf of the Danish Society for the Advancement of Science.
    As a member of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, our purpose is to strengthen the friendship between scientists from all countries and between all peoples. We hope that people of all colors from all countries will participate in this association. We hope that all different opinions can be put forward at the meeting.
    I would like to point out that there is one colored race that has not yet joined this association—the Black Africans. As far as I am concerned, these people are particularly good friends of mine, because I have written about a corner of Africa's history. Now they are progressing so rapidly, and within a few years they will be able to participate in various international organizations as well as our World Federation of Scientific Workers.
    The spectrum of the World Federation of Scientific Workers should not include only one color. It should include all nationalities, all opinions, and all different political concepts except for those that oppress the people.
    It should defend the freedom of all people, the freedom of thought of all scientists; freedom is the best environment for scientific research. When we want to discover the truth of life, the truth of history, the truth of the forces of nature, we must be able to study it from all aspects, without being limited by religion, political theories, and the concepts of recognized scholars. On this tenth anniversary, I would like to wish all scientific workers from all countries and all nationalities this freedom, and hope to achieve great success in our international cooperation.

    丹麦诺瑞加德博士的发言
    我谨代表丹麦科学促进学会向世界科学工作者协会致以衷心的祝贺。
    我们作为一个世界科协的会员，我们的宗旨就是巩固世界各国科学家之间的和各民族之间的友谊。我们希望不同肤色的各国的人民都将参加这个协会。我们希望各种不同的意见都能在会上提出。
    我想指出有一个有色种族至今还没有参加这个协会——就是非洲黑人。在我说来，这些人是我特别好的朋友，因为我曾写过关于非洲一角的历史。现在他们进步的那样快，并且在几年以内他们将能参加各种国际组织以及我们的世界科学工作者协会。
    世界科协的光谱不应只包括一个颜色。它应包括各种民族、各种意见和除去压迫人民之外的各种不同的政治概念。
    它应当保卫所有人民的自由，所有科学家的思想自由，自由是研究科学的最好的环境。当我们想去发现生命的真理、历史的真理、自然力量的真理时，我们必须能够从各方面去研究，不受宗教、政治理论以及被公认学者的概念的限制。在这庆祝十周年之际，我谨祝来自各国和各个民族的所有科学工作者获得这种自由，并希望在我们国际合作中获得伟大成就。
