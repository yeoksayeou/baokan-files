    Spend Less Money, Accomplish More
    In order to guarantee the successful completion of the annual contracted engineering tasks, the Third Construction Engineering Company of Shenyang City must build a processing plant with a daily output of 14.7 cubic meters of reinforced concrete and a construction area of 1,500 square meters this year.
      Building such a processing plant would require an investment of approximately 160,000 yuan. However, the higher authorities stipulated that the company's investment in increasing fixed assets this year was only 30,000 yuan. The company adopted the opinions of the masses and made full use of existing equipment, old materials, and waste materials to build the processing plant. The boilers and exhaust pipes used in the processing plant were replaced by the boilers and exhaust pipes used for employee bathing; the factory building's pillars, roof, and walls were all made of existing scaffolding poles and waste formwork. As a result, it was built in only fifteen days with just over 20,000 yuan, and the quality was very good.
    This experience of spending less money and accomplishing more is worthy of promotion.

    少花钱，多办事
    沈阳市第三建筑工程公司，今年必须修建一个日产钢筋混凝土十四点七立方公尺、建筑面积一千五百平方公尺的加工厂，才能保证顺利完成全年承包的工程任务。
      修建一个这样的加工厂，约需投资十六万元，可是，上级规定这个公司今年增加固定资产的投资只有三万元。这个公司就采纳群众意见，充分利用现有设备和旧料、废料修建加工厂。加工厂使用的锅炉和排气管用职工洗澡的锅炉和排气管来代替；厂房支柱、屋面、墙面等都用现有的脚手杆和废模型板等来做；结果只用二万多元、十五天时间就修建成了，质量还很好。
    这个少花钱，多办事的经验，是值得推广的。
