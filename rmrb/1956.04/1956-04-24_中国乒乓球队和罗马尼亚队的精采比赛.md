    Exciting Match Between Chinese and Romanian Table Tennis Teams
    On April 23rd, Chinese table tennis players Sun Meiying and Qiu Zhonghui defeated the renowned Romanian table tennis players Rozeanu and Zeller, the recent winners of this year's World Women's Doubles Championship, with a score of 2-0 in a women's doubles match. The scores were 21-18 and 21-16.
    This was one of the eight friendly matches between the Chinese men's and women's table tennis teams and the Romanian national men's and women's table tennis teams held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou on the 23rd.
    In the eight friendly matches, the Chinese table tennis team won 5-3.
    The matches that day started at 9:30 a.m. and lasted until 12:30 p.m., a total of three hours. There were more than 4,000 spectators.
    After the women's doubles match began, the Chinese team continuously threatened the Romanian team with fierce attacks. Although many difficult shots hit by the Chinese team were returned by the experienced opponents, the Chinese team's tactic of using short shots (hitting the ball to a spot on the opponent's side of the table near the net) to force the opponent to return the ball slightly higher, and then taking the opportunity to smash it fiercely, was still very successful.
    In the men's singles match on the 23rd, Jiang Yongning of the Chinese team defeated Harasztosi, the Romanian national men's singles champion, with a score of 2-0. The scores were 21-18 and 21-9.
    Jiang Yongning, who has always been known for his solid defense, adopted an attacking style of play from beginning to end on the 23rd. Therefore, the audience familiar with him felt very surprised. Harasztosi, who is good at both defense and attack, often used fierce backhand smashes to counterattack when receiving attacking shots, but many difficult shots were blocked by Jiang Yongning. In this match, both sides often had to play twenty or thirty rallies to get a point.
    Popescu, the defender of the Romanian team, fully demonstrated his excellent skills in saving difficult shots during the men's singles match against Hu Bingquan, an attacking player from the Chinese team. In many of the difficult shots he saved, several were returned after he retreated to the railing more than ten feet away from the table. His ball-saving artistry received high praise from the audience. As a result, he defeated Hu Bingquan with scores of 23-21, 18-21, and 21-17.
    In the men's doubles match held on the 23rd, Wang Chuanyao and Cen Huaiguang of the Chinese team defeated Retter and Gantner of the Romanian team with scores of 21-16 and 21-17.
    In the men's singles match, Wang Chuanyao defeated Gantner with scores of 20-22, 21-17, and 21-19. Cen Huaiguang defeated Retter with scores of 22-20 and 21-17.
    In the women's singles match, Qiu Zhonghui lost to Zeller with scores of 13-21 and 18-21. Sun Meiying lost to Rozeanu with scores of 12-21 and 5-21.

    中国乒乓球队和罗马尼亚队的精采比赛
    中国乒乓球运动员孙梅英和丘钟惠，二十三日在一场女子双打比赛中，以二比零战胜了不久以前获得今年度世界女子双打冠军的著名的罗马尼亚乒乓球运动员罗齐亚努和泽勒尔。比数是二十一比十八和二十一比十六。
    这是二十三日中国男女乒乓球队同罗马尼亚国家男女乒乓球队在广州市中山纪念堂举行的八场友谊比赛中的一场。
    在八场友谊比赛中，中国乒乓球队以五比三获胜。
    这天的比赛从上午九点半开始一直进行到十二点半，历时三个钟头。观众有四千多人。
    女子双打比赛开始以后，中国队就不断用凌厉的攻势威胁着罗马尼亚队。在比赛中，中国队打出的很多险球虽然都被有经验的对手接了回来，但是中国队运用的以打短球（把球打到对方台面离网比较近的地方）来迫使对方把球接得稍高，然后乘机猛烈抽杀的战术，仍然很成功。
    中国队的姜永宁二十三日在男子单打比赛中，以二比零战胜了罗马尼亚的全国男子单打冠军哈拉斯托西。比数是二十一比十八和二十一比九。
    一向以防守稳健著称的姜永宁，二十三日却自始至终采用了攻击球的打法。因此，熟悉他的观众都感到很新奇。善守能攻的哈拉斯托西在接攻球的时候，也常常用猛烈的反手抽杀进行反攻，但是许多险球都被姜永宁挡了回去。这场比赛，双方常常要打上二、三十个来回，才得到一分。
    罗马尼亚队的守将波佩斯库，在同中国队的攻击型球手胡炳权进行男子单打比赛的时候，充分地表现了他挽救险球的卓越技巧。在他抢救出的许多险球中，有好几个都是他退后到距离球台一丈多远的栏杆旁边接回去的。他的救球艺术获得了全场观众的很高评价。结果，他以二十三比二十一、十八比二十一和二十一比十七击败了胡炳权。
    在二十三日举行的男子双打比赛中，中国队的王传耀和岑淮光以二十一比十六和二十一比十七战胜了罗马尼亚队的雷特、甘特纳。
    在男子单打比赛中，王传耀以二十比二十二，二十一比十七和二十一比十九战胜了甘特纳。岑淮光以二十二比二十和二十一比十七战胜了雷特。
    在女子单打比赛中，丘钟惠以十三比二十一和十八比二十一败给泽勒尔。孙梅英以十二比二十一和五比二十一败给罗齐亚努。    （新华社）
