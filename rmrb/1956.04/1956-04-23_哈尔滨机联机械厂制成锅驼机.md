Harbin Public-Private Joint Ji Lian Machinery Factory recently successfully trial-produced 20-horsepower and 10-horsepower portable steam engines. The 20-horsepower unit can generate 15,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, which can be used to illuminate 700 to 800 peasant households and can also be used for pumping water and grinding rice.

The chief designer of the portable steam engine was Zhou Zien, a private sector employee of the factory. Technician Shan Zhiguo and two others, who were workers, also participated in the design work. (Our correspondent in Harbin)
