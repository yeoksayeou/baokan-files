    The Zhanxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anguo County, Hebei Province, discovered that some members were cultivating very roughly during the spring plowing inspection. On March 23rd, the cooperative convened a general meeting of all members. At the meeting, many facts were revealed, for example: when some members were watering the wheat fields, they did not break up the soil clumps they saw in the wheat rows, and the soil clumps were washed around in the wheat fields by the water, killing the wheat seedlings; some did not water to the end of the rows, so many wheat seedlings were not watered; some did not block up the gaps in the ridges, and large amounts of water flowed out of the fields.
    The cooperative then organized members to discuss the harm this would do to everyone. Last year, the 15th team of the cooperative planted three mu of millet, but because they did not weed carefully, a lot of grass grew, resulting in a yield of 70 jin per mu less than the neighboring fields. After the discussion, many members proposed to strengthen mutual inspection and supervision in the future to ensure that crops are well planted.
    The method of mobilizing members for self-education used by this cooperative is very good. Carrying out this kind of self-education can overcome the individualism of some members in production and prevent rough cultivation.

    反对耕作粗糙的现象
    河北省安国县崭新农业生产合作社在检查春耕工作中，发现一部分社员耕作很粗糙。这个社就在三月二十三日，召开了全体社员大会。大会上揭发出许多事实，例如：有些社员给麦田浇水的时候，看见麦行里有土疙瘩也不扒开，土疙瘩被水冲得在麦田里乱翻，把麦苗压死了；有的浇水不到头，许多麦苗就没浇上；有的畦子缺了口也不堵上，大量的水流到地外去了。
    这个社接着又组织社员讨论，看看这样做对大家有什么坏处。去年这个社第十五队种了三亩谷子，因锄地不细，长了很多草，结果每亩比邻近的地少收了七十斤。经过讨论以后，许多社员提出了今后要加强互相检查监督，保证把庄稼种好。
    这个社发动社员进行自我教育的方法很好。进行这种自我教育，可以克服一些社员在生产中的个人主义思想，防止耕作粗糙。
