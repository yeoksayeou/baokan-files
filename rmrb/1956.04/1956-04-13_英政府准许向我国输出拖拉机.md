Xinhua News Agency, London, 12th: A British Board of Trade spokesman announced on the 11th that the British government had issued export licenses to some companies in the past few weeks, permitting them to export a certain number of tractors to China. Tractors are items on the list of goods that Western countries "embargo" to China, as determined by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) presided over by the United States.

British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Nutting, stated in the House of Commons on the same day in response to a question that the British government is consulting with other countries, hoping that the China Committee of COCOM will convene a meeting soon to conduct research and "possibly allow for some relaxation of the existing embargo list." As everyone knows, at Britain's insistence, the US-UK Washington talks in early February stipulated a review of the embargo list for China, but due to US obstruction, the committee has been unable to hold a meeting.

    英政府准许向我国输出拖拉机
    据新华社12日讯　伦敦消息：英国贸易部发言人十一日宣布，英国政府在过去几个星期里已经发给一些公司以出口许可，准许它们向中国输出若干数量的拖拉机。拖拉机是美国主持的巴黎统筹委员会列在西方国家对中国“禁运”货单上的货物。
    英国外交副大臣纳丁同一天在下院就这件事回答质询说，英国政府正在同其他国家进行磋商，希望巴黎统筹委员会中国委员会不久将召开会议并进行研究，“可能使现有的禁运货单得到某种放宽”。大家知道，在英国竭力要求下，二月初的美英华盛顿会谈曾经规定要重新审查对中国的禁运货单，但是由于美国的阻挠，这个委员会一直不能举行会议。
