The main structure of the Shili Mountain Yellow River Arch Bridge, the most arduous and crucial project on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, was completed on the morning of the 17th after pouring the last cubic meter of concrete, 23 days ahead of the original schedule.

This three-arch reinforced concrete bridge, 221 meters long with a span of 53 meters for each arch, is currently the largest arch bridge structure in China. Its construction technology is extremely complex. Since construction began in October 1954, workers have overcome floods and ice floes to build tall bridge piers in the turbulent Yellow River. In August of last year, the project entered a tense stage of high-altitude operations, hoisting steel arches and pouring concrete for the arch rings and bridge decks at 30 to 40 meters above the water surface. The railway workers who built the arch bridge launched a socialist competition during the construction, and successively put forward guarantees to complete the bridge ahead of schedule. More than 400 piece-rate workers on the construction site, more than 93% of them exceeded their quotas in the competition. The early completion of this arch bridge provides favorable conditions for the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway to complete this year's track laying task. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

    包兰铁路十里山黄河大拱桥主体工程完工
    包兰铁路最艰巨的关键工程——十里山黄河大拱桥在十七日清晨浇完最后一方混凝土，主体工程比原定计划提早二十三天完工。
    这座全长221公尺的三孔钢筋混凝土大拱桥，每孔跨度五十三公尺，是目前我国拱桥建筑中最大的一座，它的施工技术非常复杂。从1954年10月开工以来，工人们战胜了洪水和流冰，在波涛滚滚的黄河中修筑起高大的桥墩。去年八月，工程又进入紧张的高空作业阶段，在距离水面三、四十公尺的上空吊装钢拱架和灌注拱圈、桥面板的混凝土。修建大拱桥的铁路职工在施工中展开了社会主义竞赛，纷纷提出保证，要把大桥提早建成。工地上四百多个计件工人，93％以上的人在竞赛中都突破了定额。这座大拱桥的提早完工，为包兰铁路完成今年铺轨任务提供了有利条件。　（本报驻兰州记者）
