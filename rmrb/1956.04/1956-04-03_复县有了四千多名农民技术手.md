Fuxian County Has More Than Four Thousand Peasant Technicians
In Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, agricultural producers' cooperatives already have more than four thousand peasant technicians specializing in various fields, which have played a significant role in developing production. In the Deli Temple Cooperative of this county, 140,000 fruit trees need pruning this spring. Because there were few people who understood the technology and the time was short, many people thought it could not be completed in time. However, technician Zhang Jinhou trained more than one hundred pruning technicians in twenty days, and the pruning work was basically completed in mid-March. Zhou Wanqing, a feeder at the Hefeng Cooperative in Chengguan District, used the method of feeding livestock with cooked grass, which fattened the livestock. Agricultural technicians from Deli Temple, Liudian, and Malian Cooperatives personally guided and have measured 1,400 mu of paddy fields. Yin Hongbin, a technician from the Lianqun Cooperative in Songshu District, created a wooden movable dam that can store water in dry weather and drain water in floods.

    复县有了四千多名农民技术手
    辽宁省复县全县的农业生产合作社已经有四千二百多名各种专业的农民技术手，在发展生产上起了很大作用。这个县的得利寺社共有十四万棵果树今春需要剪枝，因为懂技术的人少，时间又短，许多人认为不能及时完成，由于社内技术员张金厚在二十天中教出一百多名剪枝技术手，在三月中旬就基本上完成了剪枝工作。城关区贺丰社饲养员周万清采用煮熟草喂牲畜的办法，把牲口养得都添了膘。得利寺、刘店、马莲等社的农业技术手亲自指导，已测量出一千四百亩水田。松树区联群社技术手尹洪滨创造了用木头做的活拦河坝，旱天能蓄水，涝天能排水。（辽宁日报编辑部）
