　　National rice model worker Chen Yongkang has been studying rice production technology for more than thirty years, and his high-yield rice experience has been widely introduced and promoted in many regions. However, in the last year or two, Chen Yongkang himself has been spending less and less time researching production technology. In 1955, he only participated in the cooperative's production for more than thirty days; in the first two months of this year, in addition to attending some meetings of the cooperative, he only participated in field production for a total of two and a half days.

　　Why is Chen Yongkang spending so little time researching production technology? One of the important reasons is that the people who come to visit his agricultural cooperative take up a lot of his time.

　　At the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, where Chen Yongkang is located, a large number of guests come to visit all year round. Among them are government staff, enterprise employees, military personnel, school teachers and students, theater actors, writers, and so on. According to incomplete statistics for the past six months, a total of 117 units have visited Lianmin Cooperative, with more than 15,000 people. Almost the first request of so many visitors coming to Lianmin Cooperative is to ask Chen Yongkang to personally introduce his own high-yield achievements or the situation of the cooperative. It is conceivable how much time Chen Yongkang needs to spend receiving so many guests in half a year! In this case, the time left for researching production technology is, of course, pitifully small.

　　Visits play a certain role in strengthening the relationship between workers and peasants and exchanging production experiences. But it is undeniable that many visits are unnecessary, and some visits do not necessarily have to be made to the cooperative led by Chen Yongkang. On November 13 last year, thirteen visiting units with more than 2,700 guests came one after another in one day. After they arrived, regardless of how busy production was, they held on to Chen Yongkang. Some asked Chen Yongkang to introduce his high-yield achievements, some wanted Chen Yongkang to take them to his home for a visit, and others asked Chen Yongkang to take them to visit high-yield fields. As a result, Chen Yongkang had to stop all work and spend the whole day receiving these guests. One afternoon in mid-February this year, Chen Yongkang was discussing with the cooperative cadres the issue of large-scale double-cropping rice planting in the cooperative, when three comrades from the Songjiang County People's Bank came. The purpose of their visit was only to take a few photos for the manuscript they were writing for their bank's "Rural Finance" publication. In this way, Chen Yongkang had to take half a day to satisfy their request. He held a pig in the pigsty and led a cow in the cowshed for them to take pictures. Similar examples are too numerous to mention. The visitors only knew how to express their respect for this labor model by visiting, but they did not think about how to cherish the labor model's most precious production time.

　　We must loudly appeal: Quickly free labor models from excessive visits and allow them to have enough time to study agricultural technology and create better production achievements and advanced experiences. If visits to advanced agricultural production cooperatives and labor models by various government agencies, enterprises, military units, and schools are indeed necessary, they should also contact the leading organs in the visited areas in advance, and the practice of visiting regardless of time or busyness should be stopped. The leading organs in the areas where famous agricultural production cooperatives and labor models are located should make proper arrangements for visits, and try to avoid concentrating visits on one or two famous cooperatives and labor models; at the same time, unnecessary visits should be rejected.

    为什么陈永康钻研生产的时间愈来愈少
    俞暄
    全国水稻丰产模范陈永康钻研水稻生产技术已有三十多年历史，他的水稻丰产经验已在许多地区广泛介绍、推广。可是最近一、两年来，陈永康自己钻研生产技术的时间却愈来愈少了。1955年一年，他只有三十多天时间参加了社里的生产；今年的头两个多月中，他除了参加社里的一些会议外，总共只有两个半天的时间参加了田间生产。
    为什么陈永康钻研生产技术的时间会这样少呢？重要原因之一，就是到他所在的农业合作社参观、访问的人占去了他大量的时间。
    在陈永康所在的江苏松江县联民农业生产合作社，一年四季都有大批客人不断地来参观访问。他们当中，有机关工作人员，有企业职工，有部队的人员，有学校的教师和学生，有剧团演员、作家等等。根据最近六个月来的不完全的统计，到联民社参观、访问的共有一百十七个单位，人数在一万五千以上。这么多的参观者来到联民社的第一个要求，几乎都是要请陈永康亲自给他们介绍他本人的丰产成绩或合作社的情况。可以想像，陈永康半年中接待了这么多的客人，需要付出多少时间！在这种情况下，剩下来用于钻研生产技术的时间，当然就少得可怜了。
    参观、访问对于密切工农关系，交流生产经验，是有一定作用的。但是不可否认，有不少的参观、访问是不必要的，有些参观、访问是不一定非到陈永康领导的这个合作社不可的。去年十一月十三日，一天中陆续来到了十三个参观单位、二千七百多个客人。他们来到之后，不问生产怎样忙，都把陈永康抓住不放。有的要求陈永康介绍丰产事迹，有的要陈永康带他们到他家里去参观，也有的要求陈永康带他们去参观丰产田，结果，陈永康只能停止一切工作，拿出整整一天的时间去接待这些客人。今年二月中旬的一天下午，陈永康正跟合作社干部们研究社内大面积种植双季稻的问题，从松江县人民银行来了三个同志。他们来访的目的，只是为了给他们银行“农村金融”刊物写的稿子拍摄几张照片。这样，陈永康只好拿出半天时间来满足他们的要求。在猪棚里抱一只猪，在牛舍里牵一头牛，给他们照了像。类似的事例是举不胜举的。来访的人们只懂得用参观、访问来表示他们对这位劳动模范的尊敬，但却没有想到怎样来爱惜劳模最珍贵的生产时间。
    我们要大声疾呼：快些使劳动模范摆脱过多的访问、参观，让他们有足够的时间去钻研农业技术，创造更好的增产成绩和先进经验。各机关、企业、部队和学校对先进的农业生产合作社和劳动模范的访问，如果确属必要，也应该事先同访问对象所在地的领导机关联系，应该停止那种不择时间、不顾忙闲的访问。著名农业生产合作社和劳动模范所在地区的领导机关，应该对参观、访问作出妥善的安排，尽可能使参观、访问不要都集中在一两个著名的合作社和劳动模范那里；同时，对于那种不必要的参观、访问，应该加以拒绝。
