Xinhua News Agency, London, April 4th, TASS dispatch: As previously reported, the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee reconvened in London on March 19th. The work of this subcommittee, with representatives from the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and Canada, has never attracted so much attention from the international public. This is not surprising. People all over the world are deeply concerned about the resolution of the disarmament issue. The arms race deepens the danger of a new war and places a heavy burden on the shoulders of the people of all countries; stopping the arms race is one of the most important issues of modern times, and the consolidation of peace and international security largely depends on the resolution of this issue.

    Everyone clearly understands the Soviet government's position on disarmament. The Soviet Union, both in the past and now, has consistently advocated the reduction of armaments and the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. For many years, the Soviet government has considered the disarmament issue to be the most important international issue and has been fighting to achieve this goal. To show sincerity and achieve genuine disarmament, the Soviet Union took an important step in its famous May 10, 1955, proposal to bring the positions of both sides closer, accepting the Western countries' proposals on setting the levels of armed forces and the timeframe for achieving a complete ban on atomic weapons.

    Despite this, the disarmament issue has not been able to break free from the deadlock. According to "The Times," British representative Nutting mentioned in his opening remarks to the Subcommittee meeting that the disarmament issue had been discussed for more than ten years, and during this period, "our progress towards reaching a real agreement has been extremely limited."

    What is hindering the achievement of an agreement? It should be acknowledged that the differences between the countries concerned on the issue of atomic weapons are one of the main obstacles. Those who oppose disarmament are using the difficulties in resolving this issue to undermine the resolution of the entire disarmament issue.

    When the Soviet Union proposed the immediate and unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, the representatives of the Western countries declared that this proposal was unacceptable. They opposed the prohibition of atomic weapons, arguing that atomic weapons seemed to compensate for the Western countries' "lag" behind the Soviet Union in conventional armaments. At the same time, they insisted that the levels of armed forces sufficient to ensure so-called "equilibrium" must be stipulated.

    As everyone knows, the Soviet Union accepted the levels of armed forces proposed by the Western countries in its May 10, 1955, proposal. It seemed that the reason for opposing the prohibition of atomic weapons should no longer exist. However, the Western countries found new reasons to oppose the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    This time, the pretext was that there were technical difficulties in establishing effective supervision of countries' fulfillment of their obligations to prohibit atomic weapons. As a result, there has been no progress in resolving the disarmament issue. The members of the Subcommittee, once again entrusted by the United Nations General Assembly to strive to reach a disarmament agreement, have a responsibility to find a way out of the current situation.

    What proposals did the Western countries put forward after the Subcommittee reconvened? According to British newspapers, France and Britain jointly submitted new proposals for the Subcommittee's consideration on March 19th. In commenting on the proposals put forward by France and Britain, "The Manchester Guardian" pointed out that this proposal "does not contain anything new in content or principle." The newspaper did not tell the whole truth. Frankly speaking, the Franco-British plan, judging from the full text of the plan published by the British newspaper, is very clear that it not only has nothing new in content or principle, but is actually a step backward in some respects. This is primarily shown in the issue of atomic weapons. The newspapers did not ignore the fact that, as "The New York Times" said, the Anglo-French proposals "attempt to let go of the issue of destroying existing atomic weapon stockpiles" and postpone the resolution of this issue to "the distant future."

    It is difficult not to agree with this conclusion of "The New York Times."

    Although the Anglo-French proposal mentions the prohibition of atomic weapons, the discussion of destroying and eliminating such weapons from the armaments of various countries is postponed until the completion of the entire disarmament plan, and this plan is not subject to any definite time limit. The newspaper also pointed out that the drafters of the proposal themselves doubted whether this problem could be solved, so they used the technical difficulties of supervision as an excuse.

    One cannot but mention the fact that the Anglo-French plan proposes that countries undertake the obligation not to use atomic weapons, while at the same time making a reservation regarding the possibility of using such weapons in "defense against aggression." The plan also avoids the Security Council. However, everyone knows that the Security Council is the only fully empowered body to determine the facts of aggression and breaches of the peace. In the absence of an agreement on the concept of determining aggression and avoiding the Security Council, this reservation would open the door to arbitrary action, and the aggressor state could use it to launch a devastating atomic war. It can be seen from this that it is, in fact, legalizing the use of atomic weapons.

    As for the issue of reducing armaments and armed forces, as "The Manchester Guardian" pointed out, the Anglo-French proposal "does not put forward precise figures for the limits that should be set for the armed forces of the major powers." Therefore, the obligations that countries should assume under this proposal are essentially hypothetical.

    The Anglo-French proposal of March 19th did not eliminate the difficulties encountered in negotiating the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Even, on the important issue of destroying atomic weapons and eliminating atomic weapons from the armaments of various countries, as well as in many other aspects, the Anglo-French proposal took a step backward, thereby deepening the differences in the attitudes of the countries concerned towards this issue and hindering the achievement of an agreement on the entire disarmament issue.

    The experience of discussing the disarmament issue proves that linking the issue of conventional armaments with the issue of atomic weapons is a serious obstacle to reaching an agreement. It has been said in the past that an agreement should first be reached on the issue of reducing armed forces and conventional armaments, because the resolution of this issue is not as complicated as the resolution of the issue of atomic weapons. For example, at the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference, British government representative Macmillan pointed this out.

    In view of the experience of past negotiations, the Soviet government submitted a proposal to the Subcommittee on March 27th, advocating a new approach to solving the disarmament issue. The characteristic of this new approach is that the Soviet Union proposes not to link the agreement on conventional armaments with the issue of atomic weapons.

    Unlike the Anglo-French proposal, the Soviet proposal advocates that countries undertake specific obligations to substantially reduce armaments and armed forces between 1956 and 1958.

    The proposal stipulates that the five major powers reduce their armed forces to the following levels: the United States, the Soviet Union, and China—1 million to 1.5 million each, and Britain and France—650,000 each. The levels of armed forces of other countries should be determined by the World General Disarmament and Armed Forces Conference, but such levels should not exceed 150,000 to 200,000. At the same time, the conventional armaments and military expenditures of various countries should be reduced accordingly. The funds freed up by reducing military expenditures should be used to improve the welfare of the people of the signatory countries, as well as to provide economic assistance to underdeveloped countries. In order to promote the economic development of underdeveloped countries, a special fund for assisting underdeveloped countries should be established within the United Nations.

    The Soviet proposal advocates establishing an effective supervision system for the various measures of reducing armed forces, conventional armaments, and military expenditures. The proposal also advocates solving the problem of preventing a country from launching a sudden attack on other countries by establishing observation posts on the territory of the signatory countries.

    Of course, if the system for preventing sudden attacks does not take into account the armed forces and equipment of the signatory countries outside its borders, then this system cannot be effective. Taking this situation into account, the Soviet proposal advocates extending the agreed-upon monitoring system to these armed forces and equipment with the consent of other relevant countries.

    The Soviet Union proposed a strict supervision and investigation system, which should have all the necessary powers and authority and be able to practically guarantee that countries consistently fulfill their obligations under the agreement. According to the Soviet proposal, the international supervisory agency will establish branches in the capitals of the signatory countries. Their task is to maintain contact with the government agencies of those countries, lead the work of the observation posts and inspectors operating in the territory of those countries, and analyze the information provided by the countries.

    The inspectors of the international supervisory agency have the right to have unimpeded access to all supervised objects at any time: troops, warehouses storing military equipment and ammunition, bases of the army, navy, and air force, and factories manufacturing conventional armaments and ammunition. According to the Soviet proposal, the establishment of the supervisory agency and the establishment of its own branches in various places, the layout of observation posts, and the allocation of inspectors can be carried out in advance, and when countries begin to implement the measures stipulated in the agreement, they will be able to start performing their duties. This is very important.

    In this way, the various measures of reducing armaments can be carried out under the supervision of the international supervisory agency from the beginning. The powers and authority of the supervisory agency, as well as the form of supervision, are closely linked to the measures stipulated by the agreement.

    The realization of the comprehensive disarmament plan will be made possible by the implementation of measures to reduce conventional armaments and thereby strengthen trust between countries. When implementing this plan, the countries concerned will study the possibility of using aerial photography as a method of supervision.

    The current situation in Europe is that there are military blocs of some countries opposing each other, and this situation cannot but cause anxiety. In order to strive to ease tensions and consolidate security in this region of the world, the Soviet government pointed out in its proposal that it is appropriate to establish a region in Europe, including the territories of the two parts of Germany and the countries adjacent to them, where armaments should be restricted and inspected.

    In the above-mentioned region, stipulating the limits of the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, as well as prohibiting the stationing of atomic forces and the stockpiling of any kind of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons in this region, will be a major measure to solve the disarmament issue and will conform to the interests of the people of all European countries. It should be pointed out that the Soviet proposal on establishing the above-mentioned region is consistent with the proposal put forward by British Prime Minister Eden at the Geneva Four-Power Summit, and therefore there is reason to expect the British government to support this proposal.

    Regardless of whether an agreement is reached on the main disarmament issue, the Soviet government believes in the proposal that it is appropriate to reach an agreement on implementing measures such as immediately stopping thermonuclear weapons tests, not allowing troops stationed on German territory to be equipped with atomic weapons, and reducing the military budgets of various countries by 15%.

    The Soviet proposal not to link the issue of conventional armaments with the issue of atomic weapons is by no means ignoring the importance of resolving the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons.

    The Soviet government still considers striving for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons to be a major task of its foreign policy. Due to the continued implementation of the arms race, including the production of atomic weapons, the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and eliminating such weapons from the armaments of various countries is becoming increasingly urgent.

    The Soviet proposal enables the Subcommittee to break free from a difficult situation in which the resolution of the entire disarmament issue is postponed to an unknowable future due to someone using the excuse that it is impossible to eliminate and abolish atomic weapons from the armaments of various countries, and also makes it impossible to delay the cessation of the arms race. There is no doubt that accepting the Soviet proposal on reducing conventional armaments and armed forces will promote a comprehensive improvement of the international situation and strengthen trust between countries, especially between major powers. At the same time, this will help resolve many other outstanding international issues, including the issue of atomic weapons.

    The Soviet proposal opens the way for a speedy resolution of the disarmament issue, and it once again proves that the Soviet government has always been unswervingly striving to safeguard peace and international security.

    苏联政府为打开裁军僵局作出新的努力
    新华社讯　塔斯社伦敦四日电：报纸前已报道，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会三月十九日在伦敦复会。有美、苏、英、法和加拿大五国代表参加的这个小组委员会的工作，过去任何时候都没有吸引到国际公众这么大的注意力。这是不足为奇的。全世界人民都迫切关心裁军问题的解决。军备竞赛加深了新战争的危险，并且在各国人民肩上加上了一付沉重的负担；停止军备竞赛是现代最重要的问题之一，和平和国际安全的巩固在很大程度上取决于这一问题的解决。
    大家都清楚地了解苏联政府在裁军问题上的立场。苏联无论在过去或是现在，一贯主张裁减军备和完全禁止原子武器和氢武器。多年以来，苏联政府一直认为裁军问题是最重要的国际问题，并且为争取实现这一目的进行着斗争。为了表示诚意和达到真正的裁军，苏联在1955年5月10日的著名建议中采取了使双方立场接近的重要步骤，它接受了西方国家提出的关于规定武装部队水平和实现完全禁止原子武器的期限的建议。
    尽管如此，裁军问题还是没有能够摆脱僵局。据“泰晤士报”指出，英国代表纳丁在向小组委员会会议致开幕词的时候提到，裁军问题已经讨论了十年以上了，而在这个时期内，“我们朝达成真正协议方面的进展极为有限”。
    是什么东西阻挠达成协议呢？应当承认，有关国家在原子武器问题上的分歧是主要障碍之一。反对裁军的人利用在解决这个问题上的困难来破坏整个裁军问题的解决。
    当苏联提出关于立刻和无条件禁止原子武器的建议的时候，西方国家的代表们宣布这个建议是不能接受的。他们反对禁止原子武器，借口说，原子武器似乎能够抵偿西方国家在常规军备方面“落后”于苏联的情况。同时，他们坚决认为必须规定足以保证所谓“均势”的武装部队水平。
    大家知道，苏联在1955年5月10日的建议中接受了西方国家建议的武装部队水平。看来，反对禁止原子武器的理由应当是没有了。但是，西方国家又找出新的反对禁止原子武器的理由。
    这一次提出的口实是，对各国在履行禁止原子武器的义务方面建立有效的监督存在着技术困难。结果，裁军问题的解决并没有进展。受联合国大会再一次委托来努力达成裁军协议的小组委员会的委员们有责任从已经形成的局面中找到出路。
    西方国家在小组委员会复会后提出一些什么建议呢？据英国报纸报道，法国和英国三月十九日共同提出了新的建议供小组委员会审议。“曼彻斯特卫报”在评论法国和英国提出的建议的时候指出，这个建议“并没有什么崭新的内容或原则”。报纸没有把事情说完。老实说，法英两国的方案，从英国报纸发表的这个方案的全文看来，是很明白的，它不仅没有什么新的内容或原则，而且实际上在某些方面是倒退了。这一点首先表明在原子武器问题上。各报并没有忽略这样一个事实，正如“纽约时报”所说，英法两国的建议“企图放过销毁现有原子武器储备的问题”，并且把这个问题的解决推到“遥远的将来”。
    很难不同意“纽约时报”的这种结论。
    虽然在法英建议中谈到禁止原子武器，但是讨论销毁和从各国军备中取消这种武器问题被推迟到整个裁军计划完成时再进行，而这个计划却并没有受任何肯定的期限的限制。报纸还指出，建议的草拟者们自己也怀疑这个问题是否能够解决，所以就拿监督的技术困难来作为借口。
    不能不谈一下这样一个事实：法英计划中建议各国承担不使用原子武器的义务，同时却又作了一个关于在“防御侵略”的时候采用这种武器的可能性的保留。计划还避开了安全理事会。然而大家都知道，安全理事会是确定侵略和破坏和平的事实的唯一全权机构。在缺乏一个关于确定侵略的概念的协议和避开安全理事会的情况下，这种保留条件就会为任意行事敞开大门，而侵略的国家就可能利用它来发动毁灭性的原子战争。由此可见，事实上就是使使用原子武器合法化。
    至于裁减军备和武装部队问题，正如“曼彻斯特卫报”指出，法英建议“没有对大国武装部队应当规定的限制水平提出精确的数字”。因此，各国根据这个建议所应当承担的义务实质上是具有假定性质的。
    法英两国三月十九日的建议并未消除在就裁减军备和禁止原子武器进行谈判的时候所遭到的困难。甚至，在销毁原子武器和从各国的军备中取消原子武器这个重要问题上以及在其他许多方面，法英建议还后退了一步，从而使有关国家在对这个问题的态度上的分歧加深，阻碍了就整个裁军问题达成协议。
    讨论裁军问题的经验证明，把常规军备的问题同原子武器问题这两个问题联系在一起是达成协议的一个严重障碍。关于这点，过去也有人这样说过：应该首先在裁减武装部队和常规军备问题上达成协议，因为这个问题的解决不像解决原子武器问题那样复杂。例如，在日内瓦四国外长会议上，英国政府的代表麦克米伦就曾经指出过这一点。
    鉴于过去历次谈判的经验，苏联政府曾经在三月二十七日向小组委员会提出一项建议，主张用新的办法来解决裁军问题。这种新办法的特点是，苏联建议不把关于常规军备问题的协定同原子武器的问题联系起来。
    同法英两国建议不同的是，苏联的建议主张各国承担关于在1956—1958年间大量裁减军备和武装部队的具体义务。
    建议规定五大国把武装部队裁减到这样的水平：美国、苏联和中国——各为一百万到一百五十万人，英国和法国——各为六十五万人。其他国家武装部队的水平应当由世界普遍裁减军备和武装部队会议决定，但这种水平不应当超过十五万—二十万人。各国常规军备和军费应同时相应地缩减。削减军费所腾出来的资金应当用来提高协定签字国人民的福利，以及用作对落后国家的经济援助。为了促进落后国家的经济发展，应当在联合国范围内设立一笔援助落后国家的专门基金。
    苏联建议主张，对裁减武装部队、常规军备和军费的各项措施建立有效的监督制度。建议还主张通过在协定签字国领土上设立监察所的办法解决防止某个国家对其他国家进行突然袭击的问题。
    当然，如果防止突然袭击的制度不考虑到协定签字国在它的国境以外的武装部队和设备，那末这种制度是不可能有效的。苏联的建议考虑到这种情况，主张在其他有关国家的同意下把大家赞同的监察制度也推广到这种武装部队和设备上去。
    苏联建议的是一个严格的监督和调查制度，它应具有一切必要的权力和权限，并且能够在实际上保证各国一贯地执行它们根据协定所承担的义务。根据苏联的建议，国际监督机构将在各协定签字国首都设立分支机构。它们的任务是同各该国的政府机构保持联系，领导在各该国领土上活动的监察所和检查人员的工作，以及分析各国提供的情报。
    国际监督机构的检查人员有权在任何时候不受阻碍地接触到一切受监督的对象：军队，存放军事装备和弹药的仓库，陆海空军的基地，以及制造常规军备和弹药的工厂。按照苏联的建议，监督机构的建立和它在各地设立自己的分支机构，监察所的布置和检查人员的配置可以先一步进行，而到各国开始实行协议所规定的措施的时候，它们就有可能着手履行自己的职务。这是很重要的。
    这样，裁减军备的各项措施一开始就可以在国际监督机构的监督下进行。监督机构的权力和权限，以及监督的形式就都紧紧地同协议规定实行的措施联系起来。
    全面裁军计划的实现将由于缩减常规军备的各项措施的实施和从而使国家间的信任加强而成为可能，在实现这一计划的时候，有关国家将研究可能利用空中摄影作为监督的一个方法的问题。
    目前欧洲的情况是，有一些国家的军事集团彼此对立着，这种情况不可能不引起不安。苏联政府为了努力缓和紧张局势和巩固世界上这一地区的安全，在自己的建议中指出，在欧洲建立一个包括德国两部分以及同它们相邻的国家的领土在内的、军备应该受到限制和检查的地区是适当的。
    在上述地区，规定苏、美、英、法四国武装部队的限额，以及不许在这个地区驻扎原子部队和囤储任何种类的原子武器和氢武器，将是解决裁军问题的重大措施，并且符合欧洲各国人民的利益。应当指出，苏联关于建立上述地区的建议同英国首相艾登先生在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上提出的建议是一致的，因此有理由期待英国政府支持这个建议。
    不管在主要的裁军问题上是否达成协议，苏联政府在建议中认为就实行诸如立刻停止热核子武器试验、不许给驻扎在德国领土上的军队配备原子武器、削减各国军事预算的15％等措施达成协议是合适的。
    苏联提议不要把常规军备问题同原子武器问题联在一起，这决不是忽视解决禁止原子武器问题的重要性。
    苏联政府依然认为争取无条件禁止原子武器是自己的外交政策的一大任务。由于继续实行军备竞赛，其中包括生产原子武器，因此禁止原子武器和从各国军备中取消这种武器的问题就越加迫切要解决了。
    苏联的建议使小组委员会能够摆脱这样一个困难处境，即由于有人借口不可能从各国军备中消灭和取缔原子武器而使整个裁军问题的解决推到不可知的未来，并且使得军备竞赛也迟迟不能终止。无可怀疑，接受苏联关于缩减常规军备和武装部队的建议将促进全面地改善国际局势和加强各国之间，尤其是各大国之间的信任。同时，这将有助于解决其他许多悬而未决的国际问题，包括原子武器问题。
    苏联的建议为从速解决裁军问题打开了道路，它再一次地证明，苏联政府始终不渝地为保障和平和国际安全而努力。
