    Produce More and Better 666 for Farmers
    To the Editor:
    Our Tianjin Chemical Factory bears the glorious task of producing 666. The rapid development of agricultural cooperativization requires us to produce more and better 666 powder. After many studies and experiments, our factory's staff successfully trial-produced high-quality 666 powder in February, increasing the effective insecticidal ingredient from the original 12% to 14%. Through continued efforts, in March, we further increased the effective insecticidal ingredient of 666 powder to over 15%. In this way, without increasing equipment, manpower, or raw materials, we increased the output of 666 by a quarter.
    The main reason we were able to achieve such results in production is that we overcame conservative thinking, brought into play the creativity of the staff, and conscientiously learned from the advanced experience of fraternal factories. I remember when we started producing 666 crude powder in 1952, due to many problems in equipment and operation, the production situation was very poor, and we were constantly criticized by higher authorities. In 1954, we modified the equipment, and production became more stable than before, and the working environment also improved, but the unit output was still lower than that of fraternal factories. Later, we began to pay attention to learning from advanced experiences and conducting research work. Under the impetus of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, in January this year, we changed the situation where only a few people were doing experimental work and mobilized the vast number of technicians and workers to give play to their creativity and jointly improve production. In this way, we quickly found a way to increase the effective insecticidal ingredient of 666 powder, changing the past backward production situation. According to calculations, a total of 920,000 kilograms of benzene, 2.3 million kilograms of chlorine, and 9,420 man-days can be saved annually.
    We are by no means satisfied with the achievements we have made. We are determined to further increase the output and quality of 666 powder and ensure that the effective insecticidal ingredient of 666 powder reaches more than 16% in March.

### 为农民生产更多更好的六六六

    为农民生产更多更好的六六六编辑同志：
    我们天津化工厂负担着生产六六六的光荣任务。农业合作化的迅速发展，要求我们生产出更多更好的六六六药粉。我厂职工经过了多次的研究和试验，在二月份试制成功了高质量的六六六药粉，使杀虫有效成分由原来的12％提高到14％。经过继续努力，在三月份又把六六六药粉的杀虫有效成分提高到15％以上。这样，我们在不增加设备、人力和原材料的基础上，把六六六的产量提高了四分之一。
    我们能够在生产中取得这样的成绩，主要是因为我们克服了保守思想，发挥了职工群众的创造性，并且认真学习兄弟厂的先进经验。记得1952年我们开始生产六六六原粉的时候，由于设备和操作上存在着不少问题，生产情况很不好，不断受到上级的批评。1954年，我们把设备改装了一下，生产比以前稳定了，劳动环境也有了改善，但是单位产量仍然比兄弟工厂低。后来，我们开始注意了学习先进经验和进行研究工作，在农业合作化高潮的推动下，今年一月份又改变了只由少数人做试验工作的情况，发动广大技术人员和工人发挥创造性，共同来提高生产。这样，我们很快找到了提高六六六药粉杀虫有效成分的方法，改变了过去的生产落后状况。据计算，一年中共可以节约92万公斤苯，230万公斤氯气和9，420个人工。
    我们绝不满足于已有的成绩。我们决心进一步提高六六六药粉的产量和质量，保证在三月份使六六六药粉的杀虫有效成分达到16％以上。
