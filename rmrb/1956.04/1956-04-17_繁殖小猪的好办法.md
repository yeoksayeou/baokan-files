    Good Ways to Breed Piglets
    Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, has recently promoted the method of raising sows used by the Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Minjian Township. This method is: raising sows separately from ordinary pigs and giving them special care. Because the sows are well protected, the seven sows of the Shengli Cooperative gave birth to fourteen litters of piglets in just over half a year, and one old sow even gave birth to sixteen piglets. Now many agricultural cooperatives in Neijiang County have learned the Shengli Cooperative's method, concentrated the collectively owned sows, purchased some excellent breeding pigs, established piglet breeding farms, and selected experienced pig farmers to specialize in raising them. In addition, the cooperatives have also signed breeding contracts with the members who raise breeding pigs to breed piglets in a planned way.
    These methods are worth promoting.

    繁殖小猪的好办法
    四川省内江县最近推广了民建乡胜利农业生产合作社饲养母猪的办法。这个办法是：把母猪和普通猪分开饲养，给以特别的照护。因为母猪保护的好，胜利社七只母猪在半年多的时间内就生了十四窝小猪，其中一只老母猪也生了十六只小猪。现在内江县许多农业合作社都学习了胜利社的办法，把公有母猪集中起来，并且添买了一些优良种猪，建立了小猪繁殖场，挑选喂猪有经验的社员专门饲养。另外，合作社还和喂养种猪的社员订了配种合同，有计划地繁殖小猪。
    这些办法，都是值得提倡的。
