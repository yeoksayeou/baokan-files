Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th: The American workers' movement has seen new developments recently. The "May Day" Preparatory Committee, headed by the renowned writer Howard Fast, stated in a declaration that after many years of police terror and persecution, the veil of darkness is beginning to lift for the American working class. As "May Day" approaches, American workers are commemorating their traditional holiday with hope and confidence.

According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker," the "AFL-CIO," which was formed by a merger at the end of last year and has more than fifteen million members, has recently submitted the following legislative proposals to Congress at the request of the broad masses of workers: to reduce the tax burden on working people, to raise the minimum wage, to strengthen unemployment relief, to improve the social insurance system, to increase the construction of schools, civilian housing, and highways, to oppose racial discrimination, and to amend the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act. The "Daily Worker" stated that trade union organizations in many industries have already dispatched, or are preparing to dispatch, an unprecedented number of representatives to Washington to carry out vigorous lobbying activities among members of Congress, demanding that Congress take measures to realize the demands of the broad masses of working people.

This year is an election year for the President and Congress in the United States. Some trade unions are currently actively participating in election campaigns. For example, the CIO organization in Michigan is preparing to hold mass rallies in every electoral district to strive for the election of candidates supported by labor. The United Automobile Workers Union, with more than one million members, has established committees in many congressional districts and is conducting extensive election propaganda through union publications.

In the many recent strikes demanding improvements in living and working conditions, American workers have demonstrated a tenacious fighting spirit. For example, in the strike of 44,000 workers at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, despite the employer hiring strikebreakers to undermine the strike and the police attacking the workers' picket lines, the electrical workers, with the support of their brothers in other industries, persisted in the strike for 156 days, becoming one of the longest strikes involving tens of thousands of people in the United States in more than twenty years. In another famous strike, 2,500 workers at the Kohler Company have persisted for three full years. These workers continue to insist that the company must agree to the workers' demands for higher wages and the dismissal of those strikebreakers, otherwise the workers will refuse to return to work. From January to April of this year, postal and telecommunications workers in six southwestern states, bus drivers in Baltimore, truck drivers in New York, workers and staff of "Western Airlines" in twelve western states, employees of Macy's department store in New York, milk workers in Detroit, and construction workers in Los Angeles have successively gone on strike.

    美国工人运动有新的开展
    新华社27日讯  纽约消息：最近以来，美国工人运动又有新的开展。以著名作家法斯特为首的“五一”节筹备委员会在一个声明中说，美国工人阶级经历了许多年的警察恐怖和迫害，但是目前黑暗之幕正在开始被掀起，在“五一”节即将到来的时候，美国工人是怀着希望和信心来纪念他们的传统节日的。
    据纽约“工人日报”报道，去年年底合并成立的拥有一千五百多万会员的“劳联—产联”，在广大工人群众的要求下，最近向国会提出了下列的立法主张：减轻劳动人民的捐税负担，提高最低工资水平，加强失业救济，改善社会保险制度，增加学校、民用住房和公路的建筑，反对种族歧视以及修改反劳工的塔夫脱—哈特莱法。“工人日报”说，许多行业的工会组织目前已经或者正在准备派出人数空前的代表，到华盛顿进行强有力的访问国会议员的活动，要求国会采取措施，以实现广大劳动人民的要求。
    今年是美国的总统和国会选举年。一些工会目前正在积极参加竞选活动。例如密执安州的产联组织正在准备在每一个选区举行群众大会，争取选出劳工支持的候选人。拥有一百多万会员的联合汽车工人工会在许多国会选区设立了委员会，通过工会刊物进行广泛的选举宣传。
    在近来发生的要求改善生活及工作条件的许多罢工中，美国工人表现了顽强的斗争精神。例如在威斯汀豪斯电气公司四万四千工人的罢工中，尽管雇主雇用工贼破坏罢工，警察也出来向工人的纠察队袭击，但是电气工人们在其他行业的弟兄的支持下坚持罢工一百五十六天，成为美国二十多年来有数万人参加的历史最久的一次罢工。在另一个有名的罢工中，科赫勒公司两千五百名工人已经坚持了整整三年。这个公司的工人目前继续坚持资方必须同意工人提出的关于提高工资的要求，开除那些破坏罢工的工贼，不然工人就拒绝复工。在今年一月到四月，西南六个州的邮电工人、巴尔的摩的公共汽车司机、纽约的载重汽车司机、西部十二个州的“西部航空公司”的工人和职员、纽约的梅西百货公司的职员、底特律的牛奶工人，洛杉矶的建筑工人等先后举行了罢工。
