The statement said that the committee "is determined to support and defend the neutral policy advocated by Prince Sihanouk according to the wishes of all the people, is determined to unite with the Cambodian people of all strata, and to implement a policy of peace, independence, national sovereignty, and neutrality."
    In a recent statement, the Cambodian Democratic Party pointed out: "A neutral policy can shatter the forces of war and can bring countries closer together through peaceful means, according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." The Democratic Party called on the Cambodian people to unite, support the neutral policy, and oppose all aggressive conspiracies and actions that infringe upon Cambodia's neutral status.
