    Renowned Parasitologist Tang Zhongzhang
    Studies Methods to Eradicate Schistosomiasis and Other Diseases
    Professor Tang Zhongzhang of Fujian Normal College, a distinguished parasitologist who was selected as a representative to the National Conference of Advanced Producers, is actively researching the ecology of the intermediate host of schistosomiasis, the Oncomelania hupensis snail, and the intermediate host of filariasis, the mosquito, with other professors before departing for Beijing. The plan is to find effective eradication methods based on the life patterns of the snails and mosquitoes, and the embryonic development process of the Oncomelania hupensis snail.
    In 1936, Professor Tang Zhongzhang first discovered a type of Oncomelania hupensis snail in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, that was different from those in other regions. After expert identification, this snail was named "Tang's Oncomelania hupensis." In 1950, he summarized more than twenty years of research and wrote the article "Epidemiological Investigation and Research on Schistosomiasis in Fuqing County, Fujian Province," which provided important scientific data on the prevalence of schistosomiasis to the health department of Fujian Province. In 1953, he discovered different vectors for two different types of filariasis. In addition, he has made significant achievements in the study of the pathogens of paragonimiasis, hookworm disease, diphyllobothriasis, and sheep pancreatic trematodiasis. After more than thirty years of research activities, he has completed thirty-nine scientific papers.

    著名寄生虫学者唐仲璋
    研究根治血吸虫等病的办法
    当选为出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表、著名的寄生虫学者福建师范学院唐仲璋教授在启程赴北京以前正在和另外的一些教授积极研究血吸虫中间宿主——钉螺和血丝虫中间宿主——蚊子的生态，计划从钉螺和蚊子的生活规律和钉螺的胚胎发育过程，找出有效的根治办法。
    唐仲璋教授于1936年在福建省福清县首先发现不同于其他地区的钉螺，这种钉螺经专家鉴定命名为“唐氏钉螺”。1950年，他总结了二十多年的研究工作，写出“福建省福清县血吸虫病流行学调查研究”一文，给福建省卫生部门提供了血吸虫病流行情况的重要科学资料。1953年他发现了两种不同血丝虫病的不同传染媒介。此外，他对肺吸虫病、钩虫病、假叶绦虫病和羊胰脏吸虫病的病原的研究也有很大成就。经过三十多年的研究活动，他完成了三十九篇科学论文。
