    Planned Arrangement of the Work of Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors
    The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has made comprehensive arrangements for the work of traditional Chinese medicine doctors who are familiar with traditional Chinese medicine theory and have rich clinical experience.
    In the first quarter of this year, seven famous internal medicine, surgery, acupuncture, and Tuina experts in traditional Chinese medicine have already taken up medical work at the Shanghai Municipal Eleventh People's Hospital (Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital) and Huadong Hospital. This year, more than thirty hospitals and clinics in Shanghai are preparing to set up various departments of traditional Chinese medicine, including internal medicine, surgery, acupuncture, and Tuina; the number of traditional Chinese medicine beds will also increase from more than one hundred and forty to one thousand. At the same time, three traditional Chinese medicine colleges, traditional Chinese medicine refresher schools, and traditional Chinese medicine literature research centers will be established to provide elderly traditional Chinese medicine doctors with research and teaching opportunities. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau plans to have these traditional Chinese medicine doctors lead three thousand apprentices within twelve years.

    有计划地安排中医师的工作
    上海市卫生局对熟悉中医理论和有丰富临床经验的中医师的工作作了全面的安排。
    在今年第一季度里，已经有七个著名的内、外科中医和针灸、推拿专家到上海市立第十一人民医院（中医院）和华东医院担任了医疗工作。上海市今年有三十多个医院和诊所准备设置中医的内、外、针灸、推拿各科；中医病床也将从一百四十多张增加到一千张。同时还要建立三所可以供给老年中医进行研究和教学工作的中医学院、中医进修学校和中医文献研究馆。上海市卫生局计划在十二年内，请这些中医师带领徒弟三千人。
