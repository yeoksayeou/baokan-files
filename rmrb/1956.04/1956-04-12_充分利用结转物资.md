    Make Full Use of Carried-Over Materials
    Ji Yin
    When the Tonghua Copper Mine was preparing its 1956 capital construction financial revenue and expenditure plan, it listed the machinery, equipment, and materials carried over from last year, worth more than 180,000 yuan, as neither usable nor saleable. After review by the Tonghua Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China, it was determined that only equipment and materials worth 30,000 yuan were truly unusable and unsaleable. The personnel at the mine responsible for this matter agreed with the review opinions put forward by the bank. However, when the bank comrades reported the review opinions to the mine's director, the director criticized the mine's staff, saying, "This is not a joke. What if we can't sell them? You provide a sales guarantee!" After the bank comrades were rebuffed, they reported the situation to the mine's Party committee, and their opinions received the support of the Party committee.
    Like the Tonghua Copper Mine, examples of not fully utilizing carried-over materials are not isolated. According to statistics from the People's Construction Bank of China regarding 754 construction units, the machinery, equipment, and materials listed in the 1956 capital construction financial revenue and expenditure plans as unusable and unsaleable totaled 195.95 million yuan. After review, 61.77 million yuan were reduced, accounting for 31.5% of the original plan. If the Construction Bank had not conducted a careful review, then this batch of valuable materials, worth more than sixty million yuan, would have been left to rot in the warehouses, deteriorating and damaged.
    This year, the state's investment in capital construction has increased by more than 60% compared to last year. To accomplish this task, it is necessary not only for the production departments to produce more machinery, equipment, and materials, but also for all capital construction departments to fight against conservative thinking like that of the Tonghua Copper Mine's director, tap internal potential, and fully utilize all usable materials.

    充分利用结转物资
    季因
    通化铜矿在编制1956年基本建设财务收支计划的时候，把去年结转的价值十八万多元的机器设备和材料，列在既不能使用又不能销售的范围内。中国人民建设银行通化支行审查后，认为只有三万元价值的设备和材料是不能使用不能销售的。这个矿负责办理这件事的人员都同意银行提出的审查意见。但是，当银行的同志向这个矿的矿长汇报审查意见的时候，矿长却指责矿里的工作人员说：“这不是闹着玩的，销售不出去怎么办，你们提出销售保证书吧！”银行的同志碰了钉子以后，又向这个矿的党委反映情况，他们的意见得到了党委的支持。
    像通化铜矿一样，不充分利用结转物资的例子并不是个别的。据中国人民建设银行对754个建设单位的统计，1956年基本建设财务收支计划所列的不能使用不能销售的机器设备和材料，共值19，595万元，审查后核减了6，177万元，占原计划的31.5％。如果建设银行不认真加以审查，那末，这批价值六千余万元的宝贵物资，就被白白地扔在仓库里，任其变质损坏了。
    今年国家投入基本建设的资金比去年增加60％以上。要完成这个任务，不仅需要生产部门生产更多的机器设备和材料，并且要求各个基本建设部门，向类似通化铜矿矿长那样的保守思想作斗争，挖掘内部潜力，把一切能够使用的物资充分加以利用。
