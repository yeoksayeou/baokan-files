    The workers of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, after building the Jining-Erlian Railway on the grasslands, have come to Baotou one after another. They are rushing to build the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway and two roads leading to the mining area. That afternoon, I arrived at the Second Engineering Section and wanted to interview the section chief, Ding Wanchen. I asked around, but he wasn't home. Driver Wang Wu'er warmly received me. The following is his conversation:

    "Are you looking for Section Chief Ding? You'll have to wait until dark! That's just how he is. He's never indoors all day long, always running around on the construction site. If the project he's leading is spread out over a large area, he goes out early and returns late. If the project he's leading is a line, hey! He often eats and sleeps wherever he is. During the day, when the bureau calls for him, they can never find him, so they tell me to drive the jeep all over the construction site to chase him down.

    I've chased him down on the construction site not just once, twice, three times, or five times, but countless times. Sometimes, it's the leaders who ask me to go during the day. More often, it's me who has to go at night - after dark for quite a while, how come Section Chief Ding still hasn't come back? Didn't he say he would rush back to sleep? Immediately, I thought of his leg that had arthritis. Once he's tired from walking, he can't even climb a small slope. I just can't sit still in the house!

    Why am I so concerned about Section Chief Ding? Because Section Chief Ding is really concerned about me!

    Last winter, we returned from the Shang (Bancheng) - Ying (Shouyingzi) line to the Jining-Erlian line. Because it would cost too much to transport the jeep by train, I drove it back. However, Section Chief Ding didn't sit in the comfortable soft-berth carriage. Instead, he insisted on riding in my car. I advised him to take the train. He said, 'What if the jeep breaks down? I'll leave you alone crying in the mountains!'

    Along the way, we drove through mountains and rivers, with the people and the car bouncing up and down. Sometimes, when we drove into a river, the car stalled and wouldn't start. Section Chief Ding took off his shoes and socks, rolled up his trousers, and stood in the freezing water, pushing hard with me...

      I said Section Chief Ding cares about me, but in fact, he cares about everyone. As soon as he arrives at the construction site, he checks how everyone is working, playing, and living. He often goes to the kitchen and says to the cooks, 'You can only work well if you eat well. You also have a responsibility for whether the task is completed!' Liu Yucheng - that fat cook - wasn't that great at first, but as soon as he came to the Second Section, hey! He quickly became a model worker, and this time he was also selected as an advanced producer of the Third Bureau. When the reporters from the newspaper asked him to talk about his own advanced deeds, great! He praised Section Chief Ding instead. He said:

    'Good food is prepared well by own efforts, but Section Chief Ding constantly cheering us on is also a force.'

    Ah, do you think we selected Section Chief Ding as an advanced producer in the railway system just because he treats us well? No! No! He became an advanced producer because he contributes to the country.

    Section Chief Ding was originally a railway worker. From the time of liberation, he served as a rail-laying team leader, engineering team leader, deputy section chief... No matter what he was, the projects he led were always completed ahead of schedule, and the people he led became people who walked ahead of time.

    In April 1954, our Second Section was building roadbeds at kilometers 50-110 of the Jining-Erlian line. One night, I drove the jeep to the construction site to find him again. I asked many people and drove many roads before I found him. It turned out that he had just entered a tent and was chatting with a dozen workers. I had encountered such chat sessions several times. Section Chief Ding loves to hold such meetings. He said, 'Meetings in the section office can be held less often. We should move the meetings to the construction site.' When I arrived, I happened to hear Section Chief Ding speaking. He said:

    'Comrades, you all know that when we build railways, there's an old rule called "first connect, then smooth". According to this old rule, our Second Section has to build seven temporary lines and more than twenty temporary bridges. After the rails are laid and the trains pass, we will then correct the main lines and main bridges. Today I came to discuss with you all whether we can cancel the construction of the temporary lines and temporary bridges...'

    Before Section Chief Ding finished speaking, everyone "boomed" and clamored:

    'The construction period is too tight, it's too late!'

    'It would be great to see the trains rumble and stop at our door!'

    Section Chief Ding said, 'I have several reasons for making this suggestion. One reason is that we are building roads on the grassland. The grassland has a lot of wind, sand, and cold weather, which are all unfavorable conditions. However, there is also a favorable condition, which is that the grassland is very flat, so there is no need to open large mountains, cross large rivers, and building the main lines and main bridges is relatively easy, unlike other places where temporary lines and temporary bridges must be built. Another reason is that the original rail-laying team said they would lay rails into the Second Section on "July 1st". Because the supply of rails is not available, their construction period will be postponed. We can just seize this opportunity to rush to correct the main lines and main bridges. I have also calculated that we can do the large projects first, and if we don't have time temporarily, we can stack some sleeper piers for the small projects, and the trains can still pass.'

    The young men's minds turned, and their roads changed:

    'Canceling the temporary lines and temporary bridges, this idea is really great! How much wasted work will be reduced, how much wasted money will be saved!' 'No matter how great the difficulties are, we can overcome them!' 'As long as you supply me with things, I guarantee to complete the work on time!'

    Speaking of "things," everyone asked Section Chief Ding for water pipes. Originally, the plan was for the finished product factory to make four hundred of the seven hundred sections of cement pipes for bridge construction, and the workers of the Second Section to make three hundred themselves. Section Chief Ding said:

    'This problem is very big! The finished product factory hasn't set up its stall yet, so it can't produce water pipes for a while. Although it is the responsibility of the finished product factory if the water pipes are not delivered on time. However, if the trains can't pass by then, it will become our responsibility!'

    For a long time, everyone was silent. Section Chief Ding thought for a while, and then said:

    'I think this is better. I know that our working class doesn't like to just put in brute force, but loves to do technical work. The technology of making water pipes is very profound. If we not only make three hundred, but seven hundred sections of water pipes ourselves, I guarantee that everyone will become technical experts!'

    Everyone laughed: 'Section Chief Ding, you don't have to do propaganda for us. Not to mention just adding four hundred sections of water pipes. We can withstand adding another four hundred!'

    Since that meeting, Section Chief Ding has been even busier. One day, I sent him to the construction site. Geng, the director of the work area, was also in the car with him. The two of them first spoke in low voices. As they spoke, they started arguing loudly.

    Director Geng said: 'The plan is the law, it cannot be changed! Aren't you disrupting the construction plan?'

    Section Chief Ding said: 'The plan can be revised according to the actual situation. This way we can save more money!'

    Director Geng said: 'Who would insist on spending more money if they could save more money? Wait to be criticized if the trains can't pass by then!'

    Section Chief Ding became even more anxious: 'Who said the trains can't pass by then? Everyone has great confidence, why aren't you in high spirits? Besides, even if the rail-laying work stops for two or three days and we are criticized, what does it matter? We can calculate the accounts for the country: is the loss of the train stopping for two or three days greater, or the loss of building so many temporary lines and temporary bridges greater?'

    The two argued all the way. I don't know how it was resolved in the end. After a few months, just because Section Chief Ding shortened the construction period and saved 86,732 yuan in labor and material costs for building temporary lines and temporary bridges, he was elected as a glorious railway worker.

    At the award ceremony, everyone applauded and welcomed Section Chief Ding to the stage to speak. He said:

    'Actually, this honor is not mine alone, it was earned by the efforts of all the employees of our Second Section. If everyone didn't work hard, could I blow up the main lines and main bridges just by blowing my mouth?

    'As for my experience - if everyone insists that I talk about it, I will talk about it! My experience is that I love to run around on the construction site.

    'When I run around on the construction site, I see the favorable conditions for canceling temporary lines and temporary bridges. When I run around on the construction site, I can see that although the construction period is tight and the task is heavy, the workers are still often idle - this is because our work is often not well coordinated! I thought: rather than being idle and stopping work, it is better to take all seven hundred sections of water pipes and make them ourselves. When I run around on the construction site, I can see that there are indeed many difficulties in construction, so I move to the construction site to live and help everyone solve them.

    'I run around on the construction site, see a lot, and experience a lot. Comparing who is good and who is bad in my heart, I can see things clearly. For example, I went to the fifth work area. I saw that they were not tying the reinforcing bars firmly, and immediately I thought of the good method of tying reinforcing bars in the eighth work area. I let the people from the fifth work area sit in Wang Wu'er's jeep and "study abroad" in the eighth work area. I saw that the water pipes in the fifth work area were not made well, and immediately, I thought that the water pipes made in the sixth work area did not show sand or have pockmarks. I called Wang Peiying, the foreman of the sixth work area, to the fifth work area to impart experience. I saw that the workers liked to put down the dirt baskets when they carried the soil to the destination, and then lift them up again and pour them out. Immediately, I thought of the advanced experience of the "suspended soil pouring method". I said: "If you don't let the soil baskets touch the ground when you reach the destination, just pour the soil, doesn't it save time and soil baskets?" I saw that the mud houses built by the workers leaked water, and immediately, I thought of the good experience of the herdsmen building houses: "Put a layer of cow dung on the roof, a layer of cow dung is like applying a layer of oil."

    'You say, if I didn't run around on the construction site, could I see all this? I can't see it! If I can't see it, I don't know how to lead, let alone come up with "ideas" or find "tricks".'

    What Section Chief Ding said is not false! Just take me as an example, my jeep often becomes a "study abroad" car. Some people say it's strange, you ask them to "study abroad", and they are unwilling. It's like learning from others' cleverness and losing their own shame. Section Chief Ding would say to them: "What's shameful about learning from the advanced? It's more shameful than anything else to always fall behind others!" Originally, the seventh work area made the worst water pipes, and Section Chief Ding insisted that they "study abroad" in the sixth work area. As a result, the water pipes they made were even better than their teacher, the sixth work area.

    My jeep not only sends people to "study abroad", but also sends many people to the construction site. When Section Chief Ding goes to the construction site, sometimes he sits in the car alone, and sometimes he calls other leaders and technicians to sit in the car with him. Some people didn't want to go originally, but when Section Chief Ding called them, they were embarrassed not to go.

    However, people's hearts are not all the same. Some leaders, no matter how Section Chief Ding calls them, stubbornly refuse to go...

    Wang Wu'er was talking vigorously when suddenly the door opened. A communication员 came in and told me that Section Chief Ding, whom I wanted to interview, had returned from the construction site. I quickly ran to the section chief's office.

    Section Chief Ding waved his hand at me, telling me not to make a sound. It turned out he was on the phone:

    'Hey, Old Ma! What's going on? I've been to your construction site for several days, and I've seen everything, but why can't I see you?'

    After he finished the phone call, he told me: This phone call was to a work area director. This work area director does not like to go deep into the construction site, so he often becomes an obstacle to completing the task ahead of schedule. He once opposed canceling the temporary lines and temporary bridges, and also opposed taking on too many water pipe jobs...

    I looked at Section Chief Ding's face as he spoke, and for a moment I didn't know what to say. Suddenly, I remembered a passage in the editor's note of the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": "Take some time to walk among the masses, see what the masses are thinking and doing, find advanced experience from them, and promote it. This is an effective prescription for curing stubborn rightist diseases. People might as well try it." Because Communist Party member Ding Wanchen has proved with his years of work experience that this is the truth.

    工地上的段长
    介绍共产党员丁万臣的领导作风
    本报记者　刘衡
    铁道部第三工程局的职工们在草原上修建了集二铁路以后，已经纷纷来到包头。他们正在赶修包兰路和两条通往矿区的路。那天下午，我到了第二工程段，想访问访问段长丁万臣。一问，他不在家。司机王五儿热情地接待了我，下边就是他的谈话：
    你找丁段长吗？得等到天黑了！他这个人就是这样的，一天到晚不落屋，老在工地跑。要是他领导的工程在一个面上铺开，他清早去，黑夜回。要是他领导的工程成一条线，嗨！他常常走到哪里，就在哪里吃，哪里睡。白天，局里打电话找他，老是找不见，就叫我开上吉普车子到工地到处撵。
    我到工地撵他，不是一回、两回、三回、五回了，已经是数不清有好多回了。有的时候，是白天领导同志叫我去。更多的时候，是黑夜我自己要去——天黑了好一阵，怎么丁段长还不见回来呀？他不是说了要赶回来睡觉吗？立刻，我想起了他那条害过关节炎的腿，一走累了，连个小坡坡都上不去。我在屋子里怎么也坐不住了！
    我为什么这样关心丁段长？是因为丁段长实在关心我！
    去年冬天，我们从上（板城）鹰（手营子）线回集二线。因为吉普车要是由火车运，运费太大，就由我开着走。可是，丁段长他不坐舒舒服服的软席卧铺车，偏要坐我的车子。我劝他坐火车。他说：“要是吉普车抛了锚，丢你一人在山沟里哭鼻子吧！”
    一路上，我们走的不是山，就是水，人跟车子一颠老高。有时下到河里，车子息了火，开不动了。丁段长脱下鞋袜，挽起裤脚，站在冰冻的水里，跟我一块儿使劲地推……
      我说丁段长对我关心，其实他对大伙儿都关心。他一到工地，就要看看大伙儿工作怎样，玩的怎样，住的怎样。他经常去看伙房，对炊事员说：“吃好饭才能干好活。任务完不完得成，你们也有责任！”刘玉成——就是那位胖胖的炊事员，原先并不怎么样，一来到二段，嗬！很快就成了劳动模范，这次还当了三局的先进生产者。报社的记者叫他谈谈他自己的先进事迹，好！他倒夸起丁段长来了。他说：
    “伙食搞得好，自己努力干是一回事，丁段长不住地来打气，也是一股力量。”
    啊，你以为咱选丁段长当铁道系统的先进生产者，光是因为人家待咱好吗？不对！不对！人家当先进生产者是因为对国家有贡献。
    丁段长原先是铁路工人。打一解放，他当钉道队长，工程队长，副段长……不管他当什么，他领导的工程总是提前完成任务，他领导的人也就变成了走在时间前边的人。
    1954年4月，咱们二段在集二线50—110公里处修路基。有天夜里，我开上吉普车又到工地找他。问了好多人，跑了好多路，才找到他，原来他刚刚钻进一个帐篷，在跟十几位工人聊天。像这样的聊天会，我碰到过好几回了。丁段长就爱开这样的会。他说：“段上办公室的会可以开得少一点，应该把会搬到工地上开。”我去的时候，正碰见丁段长在讲话。他说：
    “同志们，你们都知道，咱们修铁路，有个修铁路的老规矩，叫做‘先通后顺’。根据这个老规矩，咱们二段要修七条便线，二十多座便桥。等钢轨铺过去，火车开过去后，再修正线正桥。今天我来，就是想跟大伙儿商量商量，看看是不是可以把修便线便桥的工程取消……”
    丁段长还没说完，大伙儿“轰”的一声嚷开了：
    “工期太紧哟，来不及！”
    “火车轰隆轰隆开过来，在我们门口停下了，那才叫好看！”
    丁段长说：“我提这个意见，还有好几条理由。一条理由是：咱们是在草原上修路。草原风砂大、天气冷，有很多不利的条件。可是，还有一个有利的条件，就是草原十分平坦，用不着开大山，过大河，修起正线正桥来比较容易，不像别的地方，非做便线便桥不行。另外一条理由是：原先钉道队说是‘七一’铺轨进二段。因为钢轨供应不上，他们的工期要往后挪。我们正好抓住这个机会，赶修正线正桥。我还盘算好了，我们可以先做大的工程，万一临时来不及，小的工程搭个枕木垛垛，火车也过得去。”
    小伙子们的脑子都转了，他们的路也就变了：
    “取消便线便桥，这个主意实在高！少做多少冤枉活，少花多少冤枉钱！”“困难再大，也能克服！”“只要供给我东西，保证按时完工！”
    一提起“东西”，大伙儿都向丁段长要水管。原来修桥用的七百节水泥管道，计划由成品厂做四百，二段的工人自己做三百。丁段长说：
    “这个问题很大！成品厂还没支起摊子，一时打不出水管来。虽说水管按时交不了货，是人家成品厂的责任。可是，火车到时过不去，就变成我们的责任了！”
    半天半天，大伙儿都没作声。丁段长想了想，又说：
    “我看这样好了。我知道咱们工人阶级不爱光出笨力，爱的就是做技术活。做水管的技术就很高深。要是我们自己不只打三百，而是打七百节水管，保险大伙儿都会变成技术专家！”
    说得大伙儿都笑了：“丁段长，你不用给我们做宣传了。不说只加四百节水管。再加四百，咱们都挺得住！”
    从开过这会，丁段长更忙了。有一天，我送他到工地去。跟他一块儿坐车的还有工区耿主任。他们两人先是小声地讲着话。讲着，讲着，就大声吵起来了。
    耿主任说：“计划是法律，不能变更！你这不是打乱施工计划了吗？”
    丁段长说：“计划可以根据实际情况修正的，这样我们可以多省些钱！”
    耿主任说：“能够多省些钱，谁硬要多花钱？到时火车过不去，等着挨批评吧！”
    丁段长更发急了：“谁说火车到时过不去？大伙儿信心都大，你为啥情绪不高？再说，即使火车过不去，钉道工作停个两三天，挨批评又有啥要紧？我们可以给国家算个账：是火车停两三天的损失大，还是修那么多便线便桥的损失大？”
    两人走一路，吵一路。究竟以后怎样解决的，我闹不清。过了几个月，就因为丁段长缩短了工期，节省了修便线便桥的工料费86，732元，他当选了光荣的铁路工作者。
    发奖大会上，大伙儿拍巴掌欢迎丁段长上台讲话。他说：
    “其实呀，这份光荣不是我一个人的，是咱们二段全体职工努力挣来的。要是大伙儿不紧赶快干，光我一人吹破了嘴，我还能把正线正桥吹起来？
    “至于我的经验——大伙儿一定要我谈，我就谈吧！我的经验就是我爱在工地跑。
    “我在工地一跑，我就看见了取消便线便桥的有利条件。我在工地一跑，我就看得见：虽然工期紧，任务重，工人还是经常窝工——这是因为咱们的工作老配合不好呀！我就想：与其窝工，停手不干，不如把七百节水管全部拿过来自己做。我在工地一跑，我就看得见施工当中的确有很多困难，我就搬到工地去住，帮助大家解决。
    “我在工地跑，看的多，经的多。谁好谁坏，心里一比较，就把事情看清楚了。比方，我到了五工区。我看见他们扎钢筋老绑不牢，立刻我就想起了八工区扎钢筋的好办法。我就让五工区的人坐上王五儿的吉普车，到八工区‘留学’。我看见五工区的水管没打好，立刻，我就想起六工区打的水管不露砂子，不出麻子。我就叫六工区的领工员王培英到五工区去传授经验。我看见工人抬土抬到目的地，喜欢把土筐放下来，然后再抬再倒。立刻，我就想起了‘悬空倒土法’的先进经验。我说：‘你们到了目的地，不让土筐落地，就倒土，不是又省时间，又省土筐吗？’我看见工人盖的泥巴房子爱漏水，立刻，我就想起牧民盖房的好经验：‘在房顶糊一层牛粪，糊一层牛粪好比涂了一层油。’
    “你们说，要是我不到工地跑，这些我都看得见吗？我看不见！我看不见，我就不晓得我该怎样去领导，更不用说出‘点子’，找‘窍门’了。”
    丁段长的话一点不假！光拿我来说吧，我这个吉普车就经常变成了“留学”车。有些人说也怪，你叫他“留学”，他还不愿意。就像学了别人的乖，丢了自己的丑似的。丁段长就要说他们：“向先进看齐有啥丢丑的？老掉在别人屁股后面比什么都丑！”原先七工区打水管打得最坏，丁段长硬要他们到六工区“留学”。结果，他们打的水管，比他们的师傅——六工区还打得好。
    我这个吉普车不光送人“留学”，还送许多人到工地去。丁段长到工地，有时是一个人坐车，有时他还把别的领导人员、技术人员叫了一块坐车去。有的人本来不想去，被丁段长一叫，就不好意思不去了。
    可是，人心就不一般齐。有的领导人呀，不管丁段长怎样叫，硬是不肯去……
    王五儿正说得起劲，忽然房门开了。一位通讯员进来告诉我，说是我想访问的丁段长已经从工地回来了。我赶紧跑到段长室去。
    丁段长向我摆了摆手，叫我不要做声。原来他正在打电话：
    “喂，老马！怎么搞的？我到你们工地去了好几天，什么都看见了，怎么就是看不见你？”
    他打完电话，告诉我：这电话是打给一位工区主任的。这位工区主任不爱深入工地，因此，他自己常常变成了提前完成任务的障碍。他曾经反对取消便线便桥，也反对过多揽水管的活……
    我看着丁段长说话的脸，一时不晓得该说点什么才好。突然，我记起了“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书的按语中的一段话：“拿出一些时间到群众中去走一走，看看群众在想些什么，做些什么，从其中找出先进经验，加以推广。这是一个治好右倾顽症的有效的药方，奉劝人们不妨试一试。”因为共产党员丁万臣用他多年的工作经历证明了这话是真理。
