    A new exploratory well drilled by the Xinjiang Petroleum Company in the Dushanzi mining area gushed crude oil on March 27th. By March 31st, the oil and gas changes underground were very normal. Now, this oil well has been officially put into production, and its daily oil production is more than ten times higher than that of ordinary oil wells in the Dushanzi mining area.
    After this exploratory well was drilled in the first half of 1955, the oil testing workers tested several oil layers, but no oil was found. On March 27th of this year, the oil testing workers completed the perforating work on an oil layer in the upper part of the oil well and found oil slick floating on the water returning in the casing. The employees at the well site were immediately overjoyed. Then, a roaring sound came from the oil pipe, and brownish-yellow crude oil gushed out of the wellhead. The oil tanks set up at the wellhead were filled in an instant. The pit next to the well also turned into an oil pool. The workers immediately dispatched to connect an oil pipeline to transport the crude oil to the oil selection station.

    新疆石油公司一口新油井投入生产
    新疆石油公司独山子矿区钻成的一口探井在三月二十七日喷出原油。到三月三十一日，井下的油和气的变化都很正常。现在，这口油井已经正式投入生产，每天的产油量比独山子矿区一般油井高出十倍以上。
    这口探井在1955年上半年钻成以后，试油工人试了好几个油层，都没有试出油来。今年三月二十七日，试油工人在油井上部一个油层完成射孔工作，发现套管内返回的水面上，飘着油花，井上职工顿时欢腾起来。接着，油管里发出轰隆隆的响声，褐黄色的原油从井口喷出来。井口设置的油灌顷刻全装满了。井旁地坑里也变成了油潭，工人立刻出动接通了一条输油管线，把原油输往选油站。
