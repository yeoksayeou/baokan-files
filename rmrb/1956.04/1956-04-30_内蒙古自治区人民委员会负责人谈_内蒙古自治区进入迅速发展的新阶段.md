    Person in Charge of the People's Committee of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Speaks on
    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Entering a New Stage of Rapid Development
    On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on May 1st, the person in charge of the Autonomous Region People's Committee gave a talk at the request of our agency's reporter. He first pointed out that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a new stage of rapid development. In the high tide of socialist construction and socialist transformation, it has successfully passed its ninth year.
    In the past year, the major production and construction projects carried out by the state in the autonomous region have made new progress. The second railway has been officially opened to traffic for joint operations, the northern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway has started construction ahead of schedule, and the construction of the Baotou industrial base, centered on the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, is being accelerated. All of this has played, and will continue to play, an important role in promoting the economic development of the autonomous region, changing its face, and improving the production and life of the people.
    The autonomous region's agricultural and animal husbandry production has actively supported the needs of national construction. In 1955, the autonomous region supported the state with more than 746,000 tons of grain. This year, it plans to supply nearly 1.1 million head of livestock and nearly 10,000 tons of wool and cashmere to people inside and outside the region.
    Next, the person in charge summarized the general situation of the agricultural collectivization and pastoral mutual aid and cooperation movement in the autonomous region. He said that by the spring of this year, the number of farmers of all ethnic groups in the region participating in agricultural production cooperatives had reached 91.67% of the total number of farmers, of which those participating in advanced cooperatives reached more than 74% of the total number of farmers. The agricultural collectivization movement is changing the ethnic relations in the autonomous region. There are already more than 2,700 joint cooperatives of various ethnic groups and integrated agricultural and pastoral cooperatives in the region. People of all ethnic groups have established a close economic relationship and further strengthened their political unity and friendship. The mutual aid and cooperation organizations in animal husbandry have also developed. At present, there are more than 250 animal husbandry production cooperatives in the region, and the number of herdsmen households participating in cooperatives and various types of mutual aid groups accounts for 63.9% of the total number of herdsmen households, creating favorable conditions for promoting settled grazing and developing animal husbandry production.
    Now, the agricultural and animal husbandry production increase movement, centered on mutual aid and cooperation, is unfolding throughout the region. This year, the autonomous region plans to reach a total grain output of 4,327,000 tons, and the total number of livestock should reach 24,690,000 head. In order to ensure the completion of the production plan, various technical measures will be further carried out in various places according to the specific circumstances. State-owned farms and state-owned ranches should also increase grain and livestock production in every farm and ranch to better play a demonstration role.
    Last year, the autonomous region's local industry newly built, expanded, and renovated 59 factories and mines. This year, the amount of basic construction work for key state construction projects and local construction units in the autonomous region has increased by two times compared with 1955. The larger construction units include the Baotou New Area water supply project, the Ulanhot Power Plant, the Hohhot Woolen Mill, and the Daheihe Tractor Station, totaling twelve.
    Regarding transportation in Inner Mongolia, the person in charge said: In 1955, the total length of highway transportation lines in the region reached more than 8,800 kilometers, and 66 banners and counties have been opened to automobile traffic. The shallow-water tugboat on the Yellow River, which is of great significance for improving inland waterway transportation in our country, has also been successfully trial-navigated between Baotou and the Hetao area. In order to promote the economic and cultural construction of Inner Mongolia, the railway to be built in the autonomous region this year is equivalent to the total railway construction task in the past two years. More than 13,200 kilometers of highways will also be built throughout the region. The length of postal routes in the autonomous region is planned to reach more than 66,400 kilometers, achieving postal services in every township in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and postal services to the district in pastoral areas. Seventy-two banners and counties and the location of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee—Hohhot—will have wired telephone access.
    In order to adapt to the socialist high tide in the autonomous region, it is necessary to actively develop cultural undertakings. He said: At present, Inner Mongolia already has a considerable number of intellectuals and some senior intellectuals, who have made beneficial contributions to the construction of the country and the autonomous region. It is necessary to cherish the existing group of intellectuals of all ethnic groups and cultivate new scientific, technical, and cultural talents of all ethnic groups. This year, the planned number of students in universities and colleges will reach more than 2,300, an increase of 126% compared with 1955; the number of students in secondary specialized schools and middle schools will reach more than 64,000. This year, the state will help the autonomous region build two universities—Inner Mongolia University and Inner Mongolia Medical College. The Inner Mongolia Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine College will also continue to be expanded. In addition, the work of reforming the Mongolian script is underway, and it is expected that the new Mongolian script will be widely used throughout the region within four years.
    Finally, the person in charge said: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved certain accomplishments in the nine years since its establishment. As it enters its tenth year, the people of the entire region will continue to work hard to complete and over fulfill the first five-year plan ahead of schedule, so that the socialist construction of the autonomous region will be greatly advanced.

    内蒙古自治区人民委员会负责人谈
    内蒙古自治区进入迅速发展的新阶段
    五月一日是内蒙古自治区建立九周年的纪念日，在这个节日的前夕，自治区人民委员会负责人应本社记者的要求，发表了谈话。他首先指出：内蒙古自治区已经进入一个迅速发展的新阶段。在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的高潮中，它胜利地度过了第九年。
    一年来，国家在自治区进行的重大生产建设，有了新的进展。第二铁路已正式通车联运，包兰铁路北段提前动工修建，以包头钢铁联合企业为中心的包头工业基地建设正在加紧进行，森林工业超额地完成了采伐任务。这一切，对促进自治区经济发展，改变自治区的面貌和提高人民生产、生活，已经起了和将继续起着重要的作用。
    自治区的农、牧业生产积极支援了国家建设的需要。1955年，自治区就支援国家七十四万六千多吨粮食。今年，计划供应区内外人民需要的牲畜达一百几十万头，羊毛、羊绒近一万吨。
    接着，负责人综述了自治区农业合作化和牧区互助合作运动的概况。他说：到今年春天，全区参加农业生产合作社的各民族农户，已达到总农户的91.67％，其中参加高级社的达到总农户的74％以上。农业合作化运动，改变着自治区的民族关系，全区已有各民族联合社和农牧业结合社两千七百多个，各族人民在经济上建立了血肉相联的关系，并进一步加强了政治上的团结友爱。牧业的互助合作组织也有了发展。现在全区已有二百五十多个牧业生产合作社，参加合作社和各种类型互助组的牧户占总牧户的63.9％，为促进定居移场放牧、发展牧业生产创造了有利的条件。
    现在，以互助合作为中心的农、牧业增产运动，正在全区展开。今年，自治区粮食总产量计划达到四百三十二万七千吨，牲畜总头数要达到二千四百六十九万头。为了保证生产计划的完成，各地将根据具体情况进一步进行各种技术措施。国营农场、国营牧场也要做到场场增粮、增畜，更好地起示范作用。
    自治区的地方工业去年新建、扩建和改建了五十九个厂矿。今年，国家在自治区的重点建设和自治区地方建设单位的基本建设工作量，又比1955年增加两倍。比较大的建设单位有包头新区给水工程、乌兰浩特发电厂、呼和浩特毛织厂和大黑河拖拉机站等十二个。
    关于内蒙古的交通运输方面，负责人说：1955年全区公路运输线共达八千八百多公里，已有六十六个旗、县通行了汽车。对改进我国内河航运有重大意义的黄河浅水拖轮，也已在包头和河套地区之间试航成功。为了促进内蒙古的经济、文化建设，今年自治区境内将要修建的铁路，相当于过去两年铁路建设任务的总和。全区还将修建公路一万三千二百多公里。自治区的邮路长度计划达到六万六千四百多公里，在农业区和半农半牧区要达到乡乡通邮，在牧区通邮到区，并将有七十二个旗、县和内蒙古自治区人民委员会所在地——呼和浩特通达有线电话。
    为了适应自治区的社会主义高潮，需要积极发展文化事业。他说：现在，内蒙古已经有一批相当数量的知识分子和一些高级知识分子，他们对国家和自治区的建设事业作出了有益的贡献。必须珍视现有的这批各民族知识分子，并且培养新的各民族的各种科学、技术和文化人材。今年，高等学校的学生人数计划达到二千三百多人，比1955年增加126％；中等专业学校和中学生人数将达到六万四千多人。今年国家要帮助自治区兴建两所高等学校——内蒙古大学和内蒙古医学院。内蒙古畜牧兽医学院也要继续扩建。此外，蒙古文字的改革工作，正在展开，预计四年内全区将普遍使用新的蒙古文字。
    最后，负责人说：内蒙古自治区建立的九年中，已经获得了一定的成就，在进入第十个年头的时候，全区人民将继续努力，提早完成和超额完成第一个五年计划，使自治区的社会主义建设事业大大推进一步。（新华社）
