    Helping Cooperative Leaders Improve Their Work Ability
    Hong Yuping
    With the expansion of agricultural production cooperatives and the increase in the scope of their operations, there is a demand for stronger leadership cores. In addition to paying attention to the composition of the leading backbone members within the cooperative and maintaining the advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants, how to further improve the capabilities of the leading backbone members is also an important issue in consolidating large-scale agricultural cooperatives.
    The Haibin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ruian County, Zhejiang Province, is a large-scale advanced cooperative recently formed and expanded by merging fourteen primary cooperatives and one advanced cooperative in the entire township, comprising more than 1,700 households. The leadership core of the cooperative is based on the original leadership core of the advanced cooperative, absorbing the main backbone members of the fourteen primary cooperatives. The cooperative director, Su Zhixian, is the deputy secretary of the township's Party branch, a representative to the Provincial People's Congress, and a labor model, enjoying high prestige among the masses. Several deputy directors and management committee members are relatively outstanding backbone members.
    However, for a period of time after the merger and expansion of the cooperative, some abnormal phenomena appeared: the cooperative director and deputy directors mostly buried themselves in the production team or a certain task they were responsible for, busy dealing with some individual problems, but failed to promptly study and deploy the most urgent tasks to be done well throughout the cooperative (such as dividing cultivation areas and implementing the contract work system). The cooperative director could not grasp the overall situation, certain work units were not coordinated with each other, and some problems in the current production could not be resolved in a timely manner. The main reason is that they still lack experience in leading such a large cooperative.
    The situation developed so quickly that it is not surprising that leadership thinking and leadership methods temporarily lagged behind after small cooperatives turned into large cooperatives and primary cooperatives transformed into advanced cooperatives in just about a month or so. As long as we pay attention to strengthening leadership in a timely manner, these problems are not difficult to solve. With the help of higher authorities, the Haibin Cooperative has initially solved these problems.
    Before the merger and expansion of the cooperative, the leading backbone members were afraid that it would be difficult to lead if the cooperative became too large. The county and district leadership did not fail to pay attention to solving this ideological concern in a timely manner; however, the solutions were not detailed enough or specific enough. The district party secretary had talked with cooperative director Su Zhixian several times, explaining the favorable conditions for running a large cooperative, pointing out that "with a larger cooperative, there will be more backbone members" and "the higher authorities will also help you better, and you can even be equipped with a secretary in the future..." This kind of talk did not solve the problems in Su Zhixian's mind. He thought: "It is only natural that there will be more backbone members and more help from higher authorities with a larger cooperative; it certainly won't be just me doing it alone; but how can I be a good cooperative director of such a large cooperative? I don't have the ability, and having a secretary wouldn't be useful!" In fact, for cooperative leaders like Su Zhixian, this kind of ideological concern is not a matter of personal gain or loss, but stems from a high sense of responsibility to run the cooperative well. Therefore, for them, it is not enough to just carry out general ideological mobilization; it is also necessary to meticulously and regularly help them improve their leadership skills and improve their leadership methods.
    This is necessary and possible. The district party secretary, who was helping with the work in the Haibin Cooperative, discovered the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena and focused on studying the issue of leadership methods. He helped the main backbone members of the cooperative realize that they could not completely use the methods of leading dozens or hundreds of households to deal with a large cooperative of more than 1,700 households; that is, as a leader of a socialist large-scale advanced cooperative, they could not be satisfied with just doing a good job in the village where they were located, but must look farther and wider, and take on the comprehensive leadership responsibility. This requires first improving the reporting system and meeting system. Comrade Su Zhixian said it well: In the past, when running a small cooperative, it was certainly not good if the reporting and meeting system was not sound, but sometimes things in a village could be understood without reporting; a few leading backbone members would meet every day, and sometimes problems could be solved without holding a meeting. What about now? There are many problems occurring in the entire township's large cooperative every day. Without reporting, it is impossible to grasp the overall situation; without holding meetings, problems cannot be solved, and there may even be problems. During the report, the current problems are raised, everyone studies and discusses them, ranks the problems, distinguishes the priorities, and finds the key points, and then studies the solutions. In this way, there will be no confusion, and the role of collective leadership can be brought into play; at the same time, it can also solve the problem of lack of coordination between certain jobs. For example, the basic construction in the field of sideline production requires a large investment. Building a pig farm alone requires more than 100,000 yuan, which will inevitably affect the investment in agricultural production. After research, everyone believed that the work spirit of the person in charge of sideline production was very positive, but it was also necessary to take into account the work of other aspects of the cooperative and to implement the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily. According to this policy, everyone proposed many ways to use existing manpower and materials, so that the basic construction of sideline production did not shrink, but the investment was reduced a lot, and the investment in the pig farm was reduced to about only 10,000 yuan. This incident clearly illustrates the important role of collective leadership and comprehensive leadership.
    When the cooperative becomes larger, the division of labor becomes more precise, and the organizational structure becomes more complex, just like a large machine. If it is still operated in a handicraft manner, it is impossible to control it. The leaders of the cooperative must familiarize themselves with the performance of each component of this large machine so that they cooperate with each other and give full play to their respective roles. There is now a very bad habit. No matter what happens (from the members or from the superiors), everyone looks for the cooperative director, and the cooperative director seems to feel "duty-bound" to take on the responsibility. As a result, the cooperative director has no time to ask about the major affairs of the cooperative, but many people are idle and have nothing to do, and many organizational structures do not work. We should help the cooperative leaders learn to use the power of the organization so that everyone can fully play their role.
    To improve the working ability of the cooperative leaders and improve the leadership methods, it is also necessary to help them study culture and political theory in an organized and planned manner. At present, the cultural study of rural workers in this area is still very poor. Some people "contract to teach," but the main leading backbone members in the cooperative cannot persist in learning. The main reason is that the higher-level party committee has not recognized the importance of rural workers studying culture and political theory, and has not made specific arrangements as a political task; some people are even afraid that arranging this work will affect other work. Rural work is very intense, and those main backbone members are indeed very busy; however, it is not impossible to set aside a certain amount of time to study culture. At present, these backbone members waste a lot of time. Take Su Zhixian as an example. One day, he received three notices asking him to attend three meetings. Sometimes, he would go out to attend meetings for half a month or 20 days (these meetings were not necessarily required for him to attend); when he returned, he was unfamiliar with the work in the cooperative. Another backbone member is known as the "report expert" because he is invited to give reports everywhere. The Party has cultivated these backbone members for many years, and it should continue to cultivate them to further grow them into the backbone of socialist construction. The method of cultivation is not to let them sit at the conference table all day long, but to help them develop the ability to solve problems in practical work and improve their cultural and political theory knowledge level in cultural learning and political theory learning.
    One of the best ways to improve the working ability of the cooperative leaders is to help them summarize their work. At present, there is still a serious phenomenon of undertaking everything on behalf of others in this regard. In the Haibin Cooperative, the several "work summaries" I saw were almost all done by people sent by the higher-level party committee. The cooperative director did not know what was said in them, and even the district party secretary who lived locally did not know. Work summary is an important link in the entire work process. It is the link point for drawing on past experiences and lessons and improving future work. However, some staff members think that this can be undertaken on behalf of others; the cooperative staff members also think that "this is a matter for the higher authorities" and "anyway, we have no culture and cannot write a summary." Lack of culture does impose certain restrictions on summarizing work; however, making a summary is not the same as "writing" a summary. If the cooperative staff cannot "write" a summary, they can be helped to make a collective summary through discussion and research. The kind of summary made by one person or a few people undertaking everything on behalf of others may not really absorb all the experiences and lessons in the work, and may not be of much benefit to improving practical work.

    帮助合作社领导人员提高工作能力
    洪禹平
    农业生产合作社的规模大了，经营的事业多了，要求有更坚强的领导核心。除了注意社内领导骨干的成份，保持贫农、下中农的优势以外，如何把领导骨干的能力提高一步，也是当前巩固大型农业社的一个重要问题。
    浙江瑞安县的海滨农业生产合作社，是不久以前由全乡十四个初级社和一个高级社合并和扩大而成的一千七百多户的大型高级社。社的领导核心是以原来的高级社的领导核心为基础，吸收了十四个初级社的主要骨干组成的。社主任苏芝贤是乡的党支部副书记，全省人民代表大会代表和劳动模范，在群众中有较高的威信。几个副社长和管理委员都是比较出色的骨干分子。
    可是，在并社、扩社以后的一段时间，这个社里出现了一些不正常的现象：社主任和副主任大都埋头在自己分工负责的一个生产队里或某项工作中，忙于处理一些个别问题，而对全社当前最迫切需要做好的工作（如划分耕作区、贯彻执行包工制等）却未能及时地进行研究和布置。社主任不能掌握全面情况，某些工作单位之间互不协调，当前生产中的一些问题得不到及时的解决。主要原因是他们还很缺乏领导这样大的合作社的经验。
    形势发展得这样快：仅仅一个月左右的时间，小社变大社，初级社转高级社，领导思想和领导方法暂时跟不上去是一点也不奇怪的。只要及时地注意加强领导，这些问题是不难解决的。在上级的帮助下，海滨社已经初步解决这些问题。
    在并社、扩社以前，领导骨干就怕社办大了不好领导。对于这种思想顾虑，县区领导方面并不是没有注意及时解决；但是，解决得不够细致、不够具体。区委书记曾经同社主任苏芝贤谈过好几次，说明办大社的有利条件，指出“社大了，骨干也多了”，“上级也会更好地帮助你，以后还可以给你配备个秘书……”这样谈，并没有解决苏芝贤心里的问题。他想：“社大了骨干更多，上级帮助更多，都是当然的，决不是叫我一个人搞；可是，怎么样才能把这么大的一个社的社主任当好呢？自己没有本事，配备个秘书也不当用！”实际上，类似苏芝贤这样的社内领导人员，他们的这种思想顾虑，并不是个人患得患失，而是出于要把社办好的高度的责任感。因此，对于他们，仅仅做些一般的思想动员是不够的，还要细致地经常地帮助他们提高领导能力，改进领导方法。
    这样做是必要的，也是可能的。在海滨社帮助工作的区委书记发现了上述那些不正常的现象，就着重地提出领导方法问题来进行研究。他帮助这个合作社的主要骨干认识到：对于一千七百多户的大社不能完全用领导几十户或者百来户的社的方法去对付了；也就是说，作为一个社会主义的大型的高级社的领导者，不能以仅仅做好自己所在的那个村子的工作为满足，而必须看得更远更大，把全面的领导责任担当起来。这就需要先把汇报制度会议制度健全起来。苏芝贤同志说得好：以前办小社，汇报会议制度不健全固然也不行，但是一个村子里的事有时候不等汇报也就了解了；几个领导骨干天天碰头，有时候不开会也可以解决问题。现在呢？全乡一个大社，每天发生的问题很多，不汇报就没法掌握全面情况，不开会就不能解决问题，甚至会出乱子。在汇报的时候，提出了当前的问题，大家研究讨论，把问题排排队，分清轻重缓急，找出重点和关键，然后研究解决的办法。这样，就不会忙乱，并且能发挥集体领导的作用；同时，还可以解决某些工作之间的互不协调的问题。例如，在副业生产方面的基本建设需要一笔很大的投资，仅修盖养猪场一项就需要十多万元，这势必影响到农业生产上的投资。经过研究以后，大家认为负责副业生产的人的工作精神是很积极的，但是还要照顾到全社其他方面的工作，并且要贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针。根据这个方针，大家提出很多利用现有人力物力的办法，使副业生产的基本建设没有缩小，而投资则减低好多，养猪场的投资减低到大约只需一万元。这件事很明显地说明了集体领导、全面领导的重要作用。
    社大了，分工更加严密了，组织机构复杂了，正像一部大机器，如果还用手工业的方式来工作，就不可能操纵它。社的领导者就必须摸熟这部大机器各个组成部分的性能，使它们互相配合，又充分发挥各自的作用。现在有一种很不好的习惯，不论什么事（来自社员的或上级的）都找社主任，社主任也好像“义不容辞”，一定要担当起来。结果，社主任无暇过问全社的大事，许多人却空着手没有事做，许多组织机构不起作用。应当帮助社内领导人员学会运用组织的力量，使每个人都能充分地发挥作用。
    要提高社内领导人员的工作能力和改进领导方法，还必须有组织地有计划地帮助他们学习文化和政治理论。这个地区农村工作人员的文化学习，目前还做得很差。有人“包教”，社内的主要领导骨干却不能坚持学习。主要原因是上级党委没有认识农村工作人员学习文化和政治理论的重要性，没有当做一项政治任务进行具体的布置；有人还唯恐布置了这项工作会影响别的工作。农村工作是很紧张的，那些主要的骨干分子确实很忙，然而，并不是不可能抽出一定的时间学文化。目前这些骨干分子有许多时间是浪费了的，就拿苏芝贤来说吧，有一天接到三个通知要他去参加三个会议，有时候一出去开会就是半月二十天（这些会并不是非要他去参加不可的）；他回来的时候，连社里的工作都生疏了。另一个骨干分子被称为“报告专家”，因为到处都请他去作报告。对于这些骨干分子，党已经培养了好多年，现在还应当继续培养，使他们进一步成长起来，成为建设社会主义的骨干。培养的方法不是让他们整天坐在会议桌子旁边，而是帮助他们在实际工作中锻炼解决问题的能力，在文化学习和政治理论学习中提高文化和政治理论知识水平。
    提高社内领导人员工作能力的最好的办法之一是帮助他们总结工作。目前，在这方面还有严重的包办代替的现象。在海滨社，我所看到的几个“工作总结”几乎都是上级党委派人来做的。里面讲些什么，社主任不知道，甚至住在当地的区委书记也不知道。工作总结是整个工作过程中的重要的一环，是吸取以往的经验教训和改进以后的工作的联结点。可是，有些工作人员以为这是可以包办代替的；社的工作人员也以为“这是上级的事”，“反正我们没有文化，写不成总结”。没有文化对于总结工作是有一定限制的：但是，作总结并不等于“写”总结。如果社的工作人员“写”不成总结，可以帮助他们经过讨论研究，集体作出总结。那种一个人或少数人包办代替作出来的总结，不一定真能把工作中的经验教训都吸取进去，也不一定能对改进实际工作有多大好处。
