The Encounter of Ordering Newspapers at Tongxian Post Office
Zhao Chen

The Ministry of Railways established a works study class in Tongxian, which started on March 1st and ended on April 25th. On February 28th, Comrade Wang Ke, the Party Branch Secretary of the class, went to the postal branch in front of the Drum Tower in Tongxian to order 16 copies of the People's Daily, 15 copies of the People's Railway, and one copy of the Beijing Daily. However, a female comrade at the post office said, "The subscription period is over. Newspapers for early March can no longer be ordered. If you order today, the earliest you can see the newspapers is March 11th." Comrade Wang Ke felt that the time was too long. How could so many people go without reading newspapers for more than ten days? He requested the post office to solve their problem with retail newspapers, but the Tongxian Post Office did not sell newspapers or magazines at retail.

On March 1st, Comrade Wang Ke went to the Tongxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau to negotiate, but was told that he would have to wait eleven days to see the newspapers. Why was this? A female comrade there told Wang Ke, "This is planned distribution, it is our system. We cannot directly request newspapers from the Beijing Post Office. We can only request newspapers from the Hebei Provincial Administration, and then the Provincial Administration notifies the Beijing Post Office to send newspapers. Therefore, we need to wait a certain amount of time."

On March 3rd, Comrade Wang Ke went to Beijing and called the circulation section of the People's Daily, asking for help in finding a way to solve the problem of newspaper subscriptions. The circulation section of the People's Daily contacted Li Xianzeng, the deputy section chief of the newspaper section of the Beijing Post Office, asking them to help solve this problem. Li said, "The Tongxian Post Office and the Hebei Provincial Administration do not have the procedures, so we cannot handle it according to the system. He should go to Tongxian to subscribe, and can ask the Tongxian Post Office to take special care, while contacting the Hebei Provincial Administration by phone, and sending the increase/decrease form to Beijing. We will send newspapers to the Tongxian Post Office after we receive it." As a result, the problem still could not be solved.

On March 5th, Comrade Wang Ke went to the Tongxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau again, and after repeated requests, the distributor Liu Ruicong reluctantly agreed to help them buy retail newspapers from Beijing and send them from the 8th onwards. Only then did he pay the money and complete the newspaper subscription procedures.

However, on March 10th, Comrade Wang Ke went to Beijing again and reported to the circulation section of the People's Daily that "The Tongxian Post Office did not send them newspapers on the 8th. They only received the newspapers of the 8th on the afternoon of the 9th, and they were missing one copy of the Beijing Daily. On the afternoon of the 10th, they had not even received the newspapers of the 9th, only one copy of the Beijing Daily of the 8th." He had gone to the Tongxian Post Office to find the distributor Liu Ruicong, who replied, "You can send a letter to inquire about it." He called Director Zhang of the bureau, who also replied that he must "investigate this matter", but there was no follow-up.

In order to solve this problem, the circulation section of the People's Daily sent someone to Tongxian on the afternoon of March 10th to find Director Zhang of the Tongxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau. The comrade in the bureau's reception room went upstairs for more than ten minutes and then came down and said, "Director Zhang is in a meeting and does not have time this afternoon." The comrade sent by the People's Daily had to return.

Let us summarize: The Ministry of Railways' works study class in Tongxian subscribed to newspapers, went to the Tongxian Post Office four times, contacted them by phone three times, and came to the head office in Beijing twice, contacted them by phone twice. It took more than ten days, but in the end they still could not see the newspapers in a timely manner.

    在通县邮局订报的遭遇
    赵臣
    铁道部在通县办了一个工务学习班，三月一日开学，四月二十五日结束。该班党支部书记王克同志在二月二十八日到通县鼓楼前的邮政支局去订十六份人民日报，十五份人民铁道报和一份北京日报。但是，邮局的一个女同志说：“订期已过，三月上旬的报纸已经不能订了；今天订，最快也要在三月十一日才能看到报。”王克同志觉得时间太久，这么多人十几天不看报怎么行呢，要求邮局先用零售报解决他们的问题，但是通县邮局又不零售报刊。
    三月一日，王克同志又到通县邮电局去交涉，也同样要十一天以后才能看报。这是为什么呢？这里的一位女同志告诉王克：“这是有计划的发行，是我们的制度。我们不能直接向北京邮局要报，只能向河北省管理局要报，再由省管理局通知北京邮局才能发报，因此须要等一定的时间。”
    三月三日，王克同志到了北京，打电话给人民日报发行科，要求帮助他们设法解决订报的问题。人民日报发行科和北京邮局报纸科副科长李显增联系，请他们帮助解决这一问题。李说：“通县邮局和河北省管理局没有手续来，按制度我们不好办。还是让他到通县去订，可以要求通县邮局特别照顾一下，一面给河北省管理局去电话联系，一面把增减单寄到北京来，我们收到后就给通县邮局发报”。结果问题还是不能解决。
    三月五日，王克同志又到通县邮电局，再三恳求，发行员刘瑞聪才勉强同意。从八号起帮他们先从北京买零售报送去。这样才交了款，办好了订报手续。
    可是，三月十日王克同志又到北京，向人民日报发行科反映：“通县邮局八日并没有给他们送报去，到九日下午才收到八日的报纸，而且还缺一份北京日报。十日下午连九日的报纸也未收到，只收到了一份八日的北京日报。”他曾到通县邮局去找到发行员刘瑞聪，回答是：“可以发个函查问一下。”打电话找该局张局长，回答也是一定要“查一查这件事”，可是一直没有下落。
    人民日报发行科为了解决这一问题，三月十日下午派人去通县找通县邮电局张局长，该局传达室同志上楼去了十几分钟后下来说：“张局长在开会，今天下午没有时间”。人民日报派去的同志只好回来了。
    让我们来总结一下：铁道部工务学习班在通县订报，先后到通县邮局去过四次，电话联系过三次，到北京本社来过两次，电话联系过两次。拖了十几天，但最后仍不能及时看到报纸。
