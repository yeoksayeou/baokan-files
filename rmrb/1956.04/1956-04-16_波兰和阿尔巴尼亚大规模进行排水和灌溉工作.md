    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 14th: From 1950 to 1955, more than 500,000 hectares of grasslands and pastures in Poland were irrigated or drained, a scale equivalent to half of the drainage and irrigation work carried out on grasslands and pastures in Poland in the hundred years before 1950.
    Of these more than 500,000 hectares of grasslands and pastures, 460,000 hectares were sown with selected grass seeds after plowing and fertilization. As a result of the drainage and irrigation work carried out in 1954, the hay harvest in 1955 increased by more than 12 million quintals.
    During the current Five-Year Plan, which began this year, the scale of drainage and irrigation work will be even larger. Grasslands and pastures requiring irrigation or drainage alone amount to approximately 800,000 hectares.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 14th: Tirana dispatch: The area of land irrigated in Albania this year will increase to 92,000 hectares, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the country's arable land.
    Since liberation, Albania has excavated more than 7,700 kilometers of irrigation and drainage canals. Last year, the area irrigated reached approximately 82,600 hectares, equivalent to four and a half times that of 1938.
    Due to large-scale drainage and soil improvement work, the area of arable land has been greatly expanded. Albania is currently draining the Terbuf Swamp. After the Terbuf Swamp is drained, Albania will gain 6,000 hectares of fertile land and greatly improve 18,000 hectares of land.

    波兰和阿尔巴尼亚大规模进行排水和灌溉工作
    新华社华沙14日电　在1950年到1955年，波兰有五十多万公顷草地和牧场得到了灌溉或者排干了积水，这个工作的规模相当于波兰在1950年以前的一百年内所进行的草地和牧场排水和灌溉工作的一半。
    在这五十多万公顷的草地和牧场中，有四十六万公顷在经过了犁田和施肥以后，播种了精选的草籽。由于1954年进行排水和灌溉工作的结果，1955年的干草收获量增加了一千二百万公担以上。
    在今年开始的五年计划期间，排水和灌溉工作的规模更大。单是需要灌溉或排干积水的草地和牧场就约有八十万公顷。
    新华社布拉格14日电　地拉那消息：阿尔巴尼亚今年受灌溉的土地面积将增加到九万二千公顷，约占全国耕地面积的四分之一。
    解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚共开凿了长达七千七百公里以上的灌溉渠和排水渠。去年，受灌溉的面积达到八万二千六百公顷左右，相当于1938年的四倍半。
    由于进行了大规模的排水和土壤改良工作，耕地面积大大扩大了。现在阿尔巴尼亚正在排干特尔布弗沼地的积水。特尔布弗沼地的水排干以后，将使阿尔巴尼亚增加六千公顷肥沃的土地，大大改良一万八千公顷土地。
