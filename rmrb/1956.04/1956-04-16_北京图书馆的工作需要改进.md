    To the Editor:
    I am a staff member of an agency in Beijing. I often go to various libraries in the city to read books, and sometimes I have to borrow books from the library for my agency. In my dealings with the libraries, I have found that some of the library's book lending systems and procedures have many unreasonable aspects. Now I would like to offer my opinions on some of the regulations of the Beijing Library.
    The Beijing Library stipulates that many books cannot be borrowed, such as rare books and local chronicles. It is understandable that rare books, being valuable national cultural relics, cannot be borrowed. However, not all local chronicles are rare books, and the Beijing Library has two or three copies of many local chronicles of the same edition. It is inappropriate to stipulate that these books cannot be borrowed at all. Sometimes readers need to borrow some pamphlets published before liberation, which are not rare books at all, but the library staff often refuses to lend them with a blunt attitude, which is even more unreasonable.
    The Beijing Library has three reading rooms, namely the general reading room, the rare book reading room, and the newspaper and periodical reading room. These three reading rooms are not interconnected. If a reader in the general reading room wants to check the *Eastern Miscellany*, they have to return all the books borrowed from the general reading room, and then go to the newspaper and periodical reading room to go through the formalities, which wastes a lot of time. I think the library should find a way to connect the three reading rooms, or at least allow readers in the rare book reading room to read books and periodicals from the other two reading rooms.
    The Beijing Library also stipulates that readers cannot bring books into the reading room. Some readers need to use their own reference books when they go to the library to read, and this regulation causes them great inconvenience. The library's intention in making this regulation is to prevent the swapping of books. In fact, this is unnecessary. Because readers must obtain an "entry and exit card" to enter the library, and then exchange the entry and exit card for a "seat number card" to borrow books. If the borrowed books are not returned, the entry and exit card cannot be returned and the reader cannot leave the library. As long as the staff at the return desk work more carefully, the loophole of swapping books can be plugged.
    The borrowing procedures at the Beijing Library are also relatively cumbersome. Readers often spend half an hour to an hour on entering, taking a seat, searching the catalog, and writing the borrowing slip. Due to the inefficiency of the staff in retrieving books, coupled with the strict restrictions on the number of books that can be borrowed each time, it often happens that the book one wants to borrow has already been borrowed. Therefore, readers who borrow books often have to wait a long time next to the counter.
    The above situations also exist in other libraries. However, the Beijing Library is one of the largest libraries in the country, so I hope they will first study these problems, further improve their work, and better serve the readers.

### 北京图书馆的工作需要改进

    北京图书馆的工作需要改进编辑同志：
    我是北京市某机关的工作人员。我经常到本市各图书馆去看书，有时还要为本机关向图书馆借一些书籍。在同图书馆的接触中，我感到某些图书馆借阅图书的制度和手续有不少不合理的地方。现在我想对北京图书馆的一些规定提出自己的意见。
    北京图书馆规定有许多书籍是不能借出的，如善本书不借出，地方志不借出等。善本书是国家的珍贵文物，不借出是可以的。但是地方志不一定全是善本，而且北京图书馆许多地方志同一版本就有两三部，这些书也规定一律不借出，就不恰当了。有时读者需要借解放前出版的一些小册子，这些根本不是什么善本书，但是图书馆的工作人员也常常用生硬的态度拒绝出借，这就更不合理了。
    北京图书馆有三个阅览室，即普通大阅览室，善本书阅览室和报刊阅览室。这三个阅览室互不相通。在大阅览室看书的读者，假若要查一下东方杂志，就要把在大阅览室所借的书还清楚，再到报刊阅览室去办手续，这样很浪费时间。我觉得图书馆应该想办法把三个阅览室联系起来，至少使读者在善本阅览室里可以看其他两个阅览室的书刊。
    北京图书馆还规定读者不能带书到阅览室去。有些读者到图书馆去读书的时候，同时也需要用自己的参考书籍，这个规定就使他们感到很大的不方便。馆方作出这个规定的用意，是为了防止顶换书籍的事情。其实，这是不必要的。因为读者入馆必须领取“出入证”，再凭出入证换得“座号证”来借书，如果借阅的书没有还清楚，就不能换回出入证和离开图书馆。只要还书柜上的工作人员工作细致一些，顶换书籍的漏洞就可以堵塞了。
    北京图书馆的借书手续也比较繁琐，读者花在入门、就座、查书目和写借书条上的时间往往要半小时到一小时。由于工作人员的取书效率不够高，再加上每次借书的册数限制较严，往往发生要借的书已经借出的情况，因此借书的读者常常在柜台旁边要等很长时间。
    以上情况，在其他图书馆也是有的。但是北京图书馆是全国最大的图书馆之一，因此我希望他们首先能研究这些问题，进一步改进工作，更好地为读者服务。
