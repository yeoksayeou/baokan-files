The First Tibetan Children to Wear Red Scarves

Seventy-five students from the Rikaze (Shigatse) Primary School have joined the Young Pioneers, becoming the first Tibetan children to wear red scarves.

On the 8th, the Young Pioneers held an oath-taking ceremony at the Rikaze People's Auditorium. On this day, five to six hundred people from Rikaze City attended to congratulate the Young Pioneers. The Panchen Kanpo Lija (Panchen Lama's Secretariat), the Rikaze Zong (administrative district), various mass organizations, and citizens from all walks of life sent representatives to present a Hada scarf to each of the seventy-five Young Pioneers. The Young Pioneers also received gifts from them, including musical instruments, sports equipment, and books.

Liang Xuanxian, Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee's Rikaze Sub-committee, and Ji Jinmei, Director of the Panchen Kanpo Lija, both encouraged the Young Pioneers to study hard. After the swearing-in ceremony, the Young Pioneers, holding the team flag high, sang the Young Pioneers' song as they returned to school. (Xinhua News Agency)
