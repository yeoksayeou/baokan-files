Editorial:

    After the forced distribution of newspapers and periodicals was corrected in 1953, and the errors of excessively rigid quota control and overly strict pre-order methods in planned distribution were addressed, the promotion and distribution of newspapers basically showed a new situation of normal development. The number of newspaper issues in 1955 increased by 54.3% compared to 1953. The number of newspaper and magazine distribution stations in urban and industrial and mining areas across the country has grown to 15,000. In particular, the promotion and distribution work in rural areas has changed even more, with some provinces achieving newspaper coverage in every agricultural production cooperative. These achievements are unprecedented in Chinese history.
    However, it should also be pointed out that the current newspaper promotion and distribution work is still far from meeting the actual needs. This is mainly reflected in the fact that the circulation of newspapers is still too small and the subscription system of the post office is not yet reasonable enough. As of the end of 1955, the total circulation of newspapers in the country was only over 12 million copies, and the People's Daily currently only circulates 810,000 copies. Obviously, this is disproportionate to China's status as a large country with a population of 600 million and the current situation of the high tide of the socialist revolution.
    The small circulation of newspapers is mainly because the content of the newspapers cannot better meet the needs of the masses, but it is also inseparable from the poor publicity and subscription work, the weak promotion force, and the small number of individual subscribers. In terms of distribution procedures, there are still many shortcomings that are inconvenient for readers. At present, some post and telecommunications bureaus have not seriously implemented the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' regulations on subscribing at any time—that is, subscribing to newspapers at any point during the month or quarter. Some county and city post offices, regardless of when the reader subscribes to the newspaper, always submit the orders on the 1st and 6th of each month. Therefore, it takes a long time from subscribing to the newspaper to actually reading it. This extremely mechanical and inconvenient system does not expand the promotion and distribution of newspapers, but rather restricts it. The example of the Tongxian Post Office published in this newspaper on April 24 is a good illustration. Tongxian is only 40 li away from Beijing, and a public bus runs every ten minutes, but it takes eleven days to start delivering a subscription to the People's Daily. An engineering study class run by the Ministry of Railways in Tongxian sent people to the Tongxian Post Office four times and contacted Beijing twice, and made several phone calls in order to get the newspaper as soon as possible. The delay lasted for more than ten days, but the "eleven-day" rule still blocked the road for newspapers to reach readers in a timely manner like a mountain. Moreover, according to the reader's letter published on page 2 of this newspaper on April 24, the phenomenon of not being able to buy or subscribe to newspapers is not unique to Tongxian.
    In order to change the current situation of newspaper promotion and distribution and increase the circulation, post offices in various places must earnestly strengthen and improve the promotion and distribution work of newspapers. The first is to strengthen publicity and subscription work, actively develop individual subscribers, and eliminate missed subscriptions. Secondly, the subscription system should be made as convenient as possible for readers, taking into account many special circumstances, changing the methods of starting subscriptions on the 1st and 6th of the month and limiting the time for subscriptions, and accelerating the transmission work and reducing the number of forwarding levels. Recently, the establishment of direct delivery relationships between post offices in 29 cities, including Beijing and Tianjin, in order to speed up the delivery of letters and eliminate the need for intermediate post offices to forward them, should be said to be a beneficial initiative to improve the transmission work. Leading comrades at all levels of post offices should support this initiative and promote this method. Thirdly, the promotion organizations of the postal and telecommunications departments should be strengthened, and newspaper and magazine distribution stations should be widely established in factories, schools, institutions, enterprises, and troops in order to carry out in-depth publicity and promotion work and further facilitate readers. At the same time, consumer cooperatives and retail stores in various cities should also be organized to sell retail newspapers and periodicals; the role of newspaper vendors should be organized and brought into play; postal and telecommunications employees should be educated to continuously improve their service attitude, and necessary reward systems should be established.
    In order to improve the current situation of newspaper and magazine promotion and distribution, it is also necessary to require Party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over the promotion and distribution work, and to mobilize all Party members and the broad masses to attach importance to the newspaper and magazine promotion and distribution work. It is very beneficial to review once again the instructions and decisions of the Party Central Committee in this regard. Attaching importance to the promotion and distribution of newspapers and periodicals is a tradition of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1938, not long after the Anti-Japanese Democratic United Front was formed, when the Party had just published the national Party newspaper—Xinhua Daily, the Central Committee instructed Party committees in various places to "ensure that every comrade should attach importance to the Party newspaper, read the Party newspaper, and discuss the important articles in the Party newspaper"; "Each branch should have a copy of the Xinhua Daily, and each comrade should subscribe to a copy of the Xinhua Daily as much as possible, and help promote and distribute it." In 1939, with the expansion of the anti-Japanese base areas and people's power, in order to unify the leadership of the distribution agencies and appropriately distribute, allocate, and promote the Party's various publications, the Central Committee decided that "distribution departments should be established from the Central Committee to the county committees, and distribution departments should also be established in district committees when necessary, and distribution officers should be established in branch committees." After the national liberation, the Central Committee's instructions on publishing and distribution work became even more numerous. The Central Committee's resolution on improving newspaper work in July 1954 pointed out: "It is necessary to improve newspaper distribution work, effectively improve newspaper subscription procedures, effectively carry out newspaper retail work in cities and transportation lines, use all possible means to improve the delivery of newspapers to rural areas and factories, and the whole Party should pay attention to treating the distribution of Party newspapers as political work..."
    Of course, there is now a national unified newspaper and magazine promotion and distribution department, and Party committees at all levels do not need to set up separate promotion and distribution agencies. However, this does not in any way reduce the responsibility of Party committees for leading the newspaper and magazine promotion and distribution work. In order to implement the Central Committee's various resolutions and instructions on newspaper and magazine promotion and distribution work, local Party committees at all levels, especially the propaganda departments of local Party committees, must regularly check whether the promotion and distribution volume of newspapers and magazines has increased, whether the post office's promotion and distribution system is convenient for readers, and especially whether the promotion and distribution work in rural areas has been established and improved. At the same time, it is also necessary to conduct regular publicity within and outside the Party to make everyone attach importance to the Party newspaper, read the Party newspaper, and discuss the important articles in the Party newspaper. In all places where conditions permit, each branch should have a copy of the Party newspaper, and each Party member should subscribe to a copy of the Party newspaper as much as possible, and help promote and distribute it.
    The distribution departments of various newspapers must also strengthen the supervision and inspection of newspaper distribution work. The postal and telecommunications departments should periodically inform the various newspapers of the promotion and distribution situation of newspapers and periodicals, and the distribution departments of various newspapers should also regularly send the inspection opinions and reader feedback to the postal and telecommunications departments as a reference for improving their work.
    Newspapers are the most powerful weapon for conducting socialist ideological education among the people, publicizing the Party's guidelines and policies, and consolidating the close ties between the Party and the masses. Newspaper promotion and distribution work must be carried out in depth among the masses, and newspaper promotion and distribution work must be improved rapidly. Do not let the readers who are as hungry as thirsty be unable to subscribe to newspapers!

### 改进报纸发行工作

    改进报纸发行工作
    1953年纠正了报刊发行工作中的强迫摊派现象，和计划发行中定额控制太死、预定办法要求过严的错误以后，报纸推广发行工作基本上出现了正常发展的新情况。报纸发行的期数，1955年比1953年增加了54.3％。全国城市和工矿区的报刊推广站已经发展到一万五千个。特别是农村推广发行工作变化更大，有的省已做到了每个农业生产合作社都有报纸。这些成绩都是中国历史上从来没有过的。
    但是，也应该指出，目前的报纸推广发行工作仍然远远不能满足实际的需要。这主要表现在报纸的发行数量仍然太少和邮局的订阅制度还不尽合理。截至1955年底止，全国报纸发行期数还只一千二百多万份，人民日报到目前止只发行八十一万份。很显然的，这和我国六万万人口的大国地位以及目前正处在社会主义革命高潮的形势都是极不相称的。
    报纸发行数量很少，最主要的是因为报纸的内容还不能更好地适应群众的需要，但是也和宣传收订工作作得不好、推广力量薄弱和个人订户较少的情况分不开的。在发行的手续制度上，也还有不少不能便利读者的缺点。目前，还有一些地方的邮（电）局没有认真贯彻邮电部关于破季破月——也即是随时可以订阅报纸的规定；有些县市邮局，不管读者在哪一天订报，他们总要在每月逢一逢六的日子才把订单汇总上交。因此从订了报纸到读到报纸，就需要很长的时间了。这种十分机械的和极不方便的制度，不是扩展了报纸的推广发行工作而恰恰是限制了它。四月二十四日本报发表的通县邮局的例子，就是一个很好的说明。通县距离北京市只四十华里，每隔十分钟就开行一班公共汽车，但是订阅一份人民日报却要十一天后才能开始送报。铁道部在通县办的一所工务学习班，为了争取及早读到报纸，先后派人到通县邮局办了四次交涉，到北京来联络了两次，还通了好几次电话，时间拖延了十几天，“十一天”的戒律仍然像一座大山一样堵塞了报纸及时到读者中去的道路。而且，根据本报四月二十四日在第二版发表的读者来信看来，买不到报和订不到报的现象，还不只是通县一地如此。
    为了改变报纸推广发行的现状，增加发行数量，各地邮局必须认真加强和改善报纸的推广、发行工作。首先就是要加强宣传收订工作，积极发展个人订户，消灭漏订。其次，就是要使订阅制度尽可能的便利读者，照顾许多特殊情况，改变逢一逢六起报和限时收订等等办法，并加快传递工作，减少转发层次。最近，北京、天津等二十九个城市邮局为了加快函件传递、免去中间邮局转发手续而建立的直发关系，应该说是改进传递工作的一个有益的倡议。各级邮局领导同志都应该支持这种倡议，推广这种办法。再次，就是要加强邮电部门的推广组织，并在工厂、学校、机关、企业、部队中广泛建立报刊推广站，以便深入宣传推广工作，进一步方便读者。同时，还应组织各城市消费合作社、零售店代售零售报刊；组织和发挥报贩的作用；教育邮电职工不断改进服务态度，并建立必要的奖励制度。
    为了改进报刊推广发行的现状，还必须要求各级党委加强对推广发行工作的领导，动员全体党员和广大群众重视报刊推广发行工作。这里重温一次党中央在这方面的指示和决定是十分有益的。重视报刊推广发行工作是中国共产党的传统。1938年，抗日民主统一战线结成不久，党刚刚出版了全国性的党报——新华日报的时候，中央就曾指示各地党委必须“使每个同志应当重视党报、读党报、讨论党报上的重要文章”；“每个支部应有一份新华日报，每个同志尽可能订一份新华日报，并帮助推销和发行。”1939年，随着抗日根据地和人民政权的扩展，为了统一对发行机关的领导，适当地散发、分配和推销党的各种出版物，中央决定了“从中央起至县委止一律设立发行部，必要时区委亦应设立发行部，支部委员会设发行干事。”全国解放以后，中央关于出版发行工作的指示就更多了。1954年7月中央关于改进报纸工作的决议中指出：“必须改进报纸发行工作，切实改善订报手续，切实开展在城市和交通线上的报纸零售工作，利用一切可能来改进对农村和工厂递送报纸的工作，全党要注意把发行党报当作政治工作来做……。”
    当然，目前已经有了全国性的统一的报刊推广发行部门，各级党委用不着另设推广发行机构了。但是，这丝毫也没有减轻党委对报刊推广发行工作的领导责任。为了贯彻执行中央对报刊推广发行工作的各项决议和指示，各级地方党委、特别是地方党委的宣传部门，必须经常检查报刊推广发行量是否增加了，邮局的推广发行制度是否便利读者，特别是农村的推广发行工作是否建立和健全了。同时，也要经常在党内和党外进行宣传，使大家重视党报、阅读党报和讨论党报上的重要文章。在一切条件许可的地方，每个支部应有一份党报，每个党员同志应尽可能订一份党报，并帮助推销和发行。
    各报社的发行部门，也必须加强督促和检查报纸发行的工作。邮电部门应定期将报刊推广发行情况转告各报社，各报社发行部门也应经常将检查意见和读者反映送邮电部门作为改进工作的参考。
    报纸是向人民群众进行社会主义思想教育，宣传党的方针、政策，巩固党和群众密切联系的最有力的武器。必须使报纸推广发行工作深入到群众中去，必须迅速地改进报纸推广发行工作，不要让如饥如渴的读者再订阅不上报纸！
