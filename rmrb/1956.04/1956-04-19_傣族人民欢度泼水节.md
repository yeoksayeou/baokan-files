    Dai People Celebrate Water-Splashing Festival
    The 150,000 Dai people in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province joyfully celebrated the annual Water-Splashing Festival. The Water-Splashing Festival is a traditional Dai festival symbolizing the arrival of the hot season, where people splash water on each other to wish for good health. Starting from the 13th—the day before the festival—early in the morning, many Dai people who believe in Buddhism, dressed in festive attire, carried buckets filled with flowers and clear water, and gathered at more than 500 Burmese temples in the autonomous region to pray. At the Burmese temple in Mangshi, where the People's Government of the Autonomous Region is located, Dai Buddhist men and women from nearby villages placed flowers around the Buddha statues and poured water into the water troughs. As the water flowed through the troughs, it splashed onto the Buddha statues. Then, everyone splashed water on each other, wishing each other good health.

    During the festival, the sound of elephant-foot drums, cymbals, and laughter echoed throughout the 1,000 Dai villages in the autonomous region. In the villages surrounded by lush bamboo and banana trees, and in the fields, lively Dai young men and women chased each other and splashed water on each other with great joy. Groups of Dai farmers came to the office building of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region and splashed buckets of clear water on cadres of various ethnic groups. Officers and soldiers of the border defense army stationed in the autonomous region, as well as Jingpo hunters who came down from the mountains, also received water-splashing blessings from the Dai people. The festive revelry continued until the evening of the 15th.

    On the eve of the festival, young Dai men and women in the villages climbed the mountain ridges of the Gaoligong Mountains and collected many fresh flowers and saplings. They displayed pots of flowers in their bamboo houses and planted saplings by the roadsides, ditches, and around the bamboo houses near the villages. Some villages also launched environmental sanitation and manure accumulation activities.

    傣族人民欢度泼水节
    云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区十五万傣族人民欢度了一年一次的泼水节。泼水节是象征炎暑到来以泼水互祝身体健康的傣族传统节日。从十三日——节日前一天开始，清晨就有许多信佛教的傣族人民穿着盛装，挑着盛有鲜花和清水的水桶，齐集到自治区五百多处缅寺里祈祷。在自治区人民政府所在地芒市的缅寺里，来自附近乡寨的傣族男女佛教徒，纷纷把鲜花插在佛像周围，把水倒在水槽里，水流过水槽时，泼溅到佛像上，然后，大家互相泼水，祝福身体健康。
    节日里，全自治区一千个傣族寨子，处处响着象脚鼓声、芒钹声和欢笑声。在翠竹和芭蕉林的寨子里、在田野上，活泼的傣族男女青年兴高采烈地互相追逐、相互泼水。成群结队的傣族农民，相约来到自治区人民政府办公大楼前，把一桶桶的清水泼到各族干部的身上。驻守在自治区境内的边防军军官和战士以及从山上下来的景颇族猎手，也都受到傣族人民的泼水祝福。节日的狂欢一直延续到十五日晚上。
    节日前夕，寨子里的傣族男女青年，攀登到高黎贡山脉的山岗上，采集了许多鲜花和树苗。他们在竹楼上摆着一盆盆的鲜花，把树苗栽在寨子附近的路边、沟旁和竹楼周围。有些寨子还展开了环境卫生和积肥的活动。　（新华社）
