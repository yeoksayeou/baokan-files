Editor's note: The following letters from readers unanimously reflect the difficulties in subscribing to and buying newspapers in various regions. Judging from the situation in various places, the current newspaper and magazine distribution work is far from meeting the requirements of the central government's instruction to "make the subscription methods as convenient as possible for readers and take care of many special circumstances." We hope that comrades in the postal and telecommunications work in various regions will listen to these opinions, earnestly improve distribution work, increase the number of newspapers distributed, and widely distribute newspapers to the masses.

	Cannot Buy Newspapers in the Suburbs of Taiyuan
	Wu Zhenbin from Taiyuan City Post Office Box No. 11 writes: I have been in the suburbs of Taiyuan City for more than a month and found that the post office here is doing a very poor job in distributing books and newspapers. In order to understand the situation of our country's great socialist construction, we are very eager to see the "People's Daily," but we cannot buy it at the Waliu Postal and Telecommunications Branch in the suburbs of Taiyuan City. They say that there are special post offices selling newspapers in the city. But how can we possibly run dozens of miles into the city to buy newspapers every day! Moreover, the post office only offers monthly subscriptions and does not sell individual copies. I think this is an irresponsible phenomenon in distribution work. I suggest that the postal and telecommunications departments improve newspaper distribution work and take active measures to do a good job in newspaper distribution.

	Why No Retail Newspapers?
	Li Chenghua from Shenyang City Post Office Box No. 551 writes on February 7th: The fact that national newspapers are not sold retail in various cities is a major shortcoming in distribution work. The post office may think that national newspapers are outdated when they are transported from Beijing to certain areas and have no news value, but now several national newspapers such as the People's Daily are printed locally in some big cities like Shenyang, so why are they not sold retail in these areas? Moreover, the content of national newspapers is not limited to simple news reports.

	Lin Ruixin from the Cadre Sanatorium in Changsha City, Hunan Province writes: I am a Communist Party member and I am very interested in some of the speeches made by the Soviet leaders at the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The "New Hunan Daily" has published excerpts of these speeches, and because I wanted to read the full text of these speeches, I asked many comrades to buy the "People's Daily," but regrettably, I couldn't buy the "People's Daily" in Changsha no matter what. This cannot but be said to be a major shortcoming in the distribution work.

	Unreasonable Subscription Methods
	Yang Tiangang from the Second Platoon of the Fourth Detachment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Unit 0217 writes on February 29th: Recently I received a letter from Comrade Yang Tianmin from the Second Platoon of the First Company of the 431st Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea. He said that because the date for subscribing to the newspapers for the second quarter had passed, he could no longer subscribe to the "People's Daily" for the second quarter. He asked me to find a way to subscribe to a copy of the "People's Daily" for him in China for the second quarter. I wonder if this is possible?

	Hope to Cancel Unreasonable Restrictions
	Liu Yuanmou from the Northwest Finance Cadre School in Xi'an writes on February 26th: Today (February 26th) I went to the Xi'an Post Office to subscribe to the "People's Daily" for March, but I have to subscribe from March 3rd because the subscription date has passed.
	Recently, the "People's Daily" has lowered its price, and the post office is also expanding retail sales of newspapers, but the Xi'an Post Office imposes some unreasonable restrictions on subscribers, which is very irritating. I did not subscribe to the newspaper according to the date stipulated by the Xi'an Post Office because I did not receive a renewal order from the post office at all, notifying me when I should subscribe to the newspaper. I hope that the Xi'an Post Office will cancel unnecessary restrictions on subscribers and, best of all, issue renewal orders as soon as possible to notify subscribers to subscribe to the newspaper.

	Missed Five Days of Newspapers
	The People's Government of Shanba Town, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region writes on March 22nd: We have been subscribing to three copies of the People's Daily for a long time. In April, because the payment was late, we could not subscribe to the newspapers from April 1st to 5th, and we will only receive the newspapers from the 6th.

	The General Affairs Office of Huangshi Middle School in Hubei Province writes on March 20th: Our school has always subscribed to the "People's Daily" at the local post office. Recently, when subscribing to the newspapers for the second quarter, the notification form was transferred to another comrade, and the subscription period was exceeded. According to the post office's regulations, we will only receive the newspapers from April 6th, and we will not receive the five issues of the newspaper from April 1st to 5th. We request you to find a way to re-subscribe to two copies, ten sheets, of the newspaper from the 1st to the 5th.

### 读者对报纸发行工作的意见

专栏：

    读者对报纸发行工作的意见
    编者按：下面发表的一批读者来信，一致反映了在各地订报和买报的困难。从各地情况看来，目前的报刊发行工作，还远远没有达到中央指示的“预定办法要尽可能便利读者，照顾许多特殊情况”的要求。希望各地邮电工作的同志能听取这些意见，切实改进发行工作，增加报纸发行数量，把报纸广泛地发行到群众中去。
    太原市郊买不到报
    太原市第十一号信箱吴振滨的来信：我到太原市郊区一个多月，发现这里的邮局对书报发行工作作的很不好。我们为了了解祖国伟大社会主义建设的情形，非常渴望能看到“人民日报”，可是在太原市郊区洼流邮电支局却买不到“人民日报”，他们说城里有专门卖报的邮局。不过我们又怎么可能一天跑几十里路进城去买报纸呢！而且邮局只按月订报，不零售。我认为这是对发行工作不负责任的现象，建议邮电部门改进报纸发行工作，采取积极的措施，做好报纸的发行工作。
    为什么没有零售报
    沈阳市第五五一号信箱李承华二月七日的来信：全国性的报纸在各城市里不零售，这是发行工作很大的一个缺点。可能邮局认为全国性的报纸由北京运到某些地区已经过时，没有新闻价值了，可是现在人民日报等好几种全国性的报纸都在沈阳等一些大城市分地印刷，那在这些地区为什么也不零售呢？何况全国性报纸的内容，也不仅限于单纯的报道新闻。
    湖南省长沙市干部疗养院林瑞信的来信：我是共产党员，对苏共第二十次代表大会上苏共领导同志的一些发言非常感兴趣。“新湖南报”对这些发言都是摘要发表的，我因想看这些发言的全文，曾托了很多同志去买“人民日报”，可是遗憾的很，在长沙无论如何都买不到“人民日报”。这不能不说是发行工作的一个重大的缺点。
    不合理的收订办法
    中国人民解放军○二一七部四支队二分队杨天刚二月二十九日的来信：最近我收到了在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军四三一部一中队二分队杨天民同志的来信。他说因为收订第二季度报纸日期过了，没有办法再订到第二季度的“人民日报”了，他托我想办法在国内给他订一份第二季度的“人民日报”。不知是否可以？
    希望取消无理限制
    西安西北财政干部学校刘源谋二月二十六日的来信：今天（二十六日）我到西安邮局去订三月份的“人民日报”，但是要从三月三日订起，因为订报日期过了。
    最近“人民日报”降低了报价，邮局也在扩大零售报纸，可是西安邮局对订户规定一些不合理的限制，这很使人气忿。我没有按着西安邮局规定的日期去订报，是因为我根本就没有接到过邮局的续订单，通知我应该什么时候去订报。希望西安邮局取消对订户不需要的限制，并且最好尽早发续订单，通知订户订报。
    缺了五天的报
    内蒙古自治区陕坝镇人民政府三月二十二日的来信：我们长期订阅人民日报三份，四月份因为交费晚了，就不能够订到四月一日至五日的报纸了，要从六日才有报纸。
    湖北省黄石中学总务处三月二十日的来信：我们学校一向是在当地邮局订阅“人民日报”的。最近订阅第二季度报纸的时候，由于通知单转给了另外一个同志，把订期超过了，按照邮局的规定，要从四月六日起才有报纸，四月一日到五日的五期报纸就收不到了。我们要求你们设法给补订一日到五日的报纸两份十张。
