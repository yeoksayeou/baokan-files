    A District Committee Good at Specific Leadership
    Zhou Zhenhua
    In 1953, Jiming Village District in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, was a severely grain-deficient area requiring 1.63 million catties of grain from the state. By the autumn of 1955, it had not only achieved complete self-sufficiency in grain but also had a surplus to support national construction. How did this change occur? The key lies in the district's Communist Party Committee implementing specific and in-depth leadership, and thoroughly executing the Party's policies on developing mutual aid and cooperation, as well as its policies on developing production.
    This district experimented with two cooperatives in 1952. At that time, not only did the cooperative cadres and township cadres not know how to run the cooperatives, but even the district cadres were ignorant. Naturally, there were many difficulties in the work. However, the district committee did not avoid difficulties but strived to overcome them. The district committee first led the district cadres to study the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies, and to learn from the experiences of other regions in running cooperatives. At the same time, it established a district mutual aid and cooperation guidance committee, which frequently studied specific issues in establishing and running cooperatives. Members of the district committee also went deep into the cooperatives to understand the situation, explore experiences, and specifically help cooperative cadres solve problems. By the autumn of 1953, all twenty-five cadres in the district could independently help the cooperatives handle issues. However, in order to keep up with the development needs of the cooperatives, it was not enough for just the district cadres to know how to run them; it was also necessary to rely on and help the township branches cultivate a large number of township and village cadres to run the cooperatives. The district committee adopted methods such as key demonstrations by district cadres, establishing a mutual aid and cooperation network, organizing observation tours, and small training classes to conduct universal training and education for township cadres, village cadres, and activists in running cooperatives. By the beginning of 1955, after the basic realization of cooperativization in the entire district, not only had all forty-one resident township cadres become experts or semi-experts in running cooperatives, but also 144 of the 375 branch secretaries and village directors, and other main village-level cadres, had become experts in running cooperatives, with the other 231 also capable of solving general problems in running cooperatives. This greatly promoted the consolidation of cooperatives and the development of production throughout the district.
    With the development of cooperatives, the district committee also strengthened its specific leadership over production, gradually solving several key issues in increasing grain production in the mountainous area. The first was the issue of accumulating fertilizer. For many years, this district did not have the habit of accumulating and applying large amounts of fertilizer; on average, only 1,000 catties of fertilizer were applied per mu of land, and about 30% of the land in the district was not fertilized at all. The district committee analyzed that there were two reasons for the low fertilizer application: first, many farmers did not believe that applying large amounts of fertilizer could lead to large increases in production, and second, the district lacked sources of fertilizer and could not accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. The district committee used examples of large increases in production resulting from large applications of fertilizer to educate the farmers. On the other hand, the district committee helped the masses find ways to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. As a result, a method of accumulating fertilizer was discovered in Qiangzhuangzi Village, which was to use weeds from the mountainside and the edges of the fields to compost fire fertilizer. After studying and summarizing this advanced experience, the district committee immediately publicized and promoted it throughout the district. Subsequently, various methods of accumulating fertilizer created by the farmers, such as building urine pools, pressing green manure, and accumulating small amounts of ash, were summarized and promoted. This fundamentally solved the problem of the lack of fertilizer sources. By 1955, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land in the district had reached 4,200 catties, an increase of more than three times compared to 1952.
    While solving the problem of fertilizer accumulation, the district committee led the district's water conservancy construction work. The district committee first carried out a pilot project for water conservancy construction in Baimayu Village. The district committee assisted the village party branch in organizing all party members to study the advanced experience of Yuan Shizhen, a national model for afforestation, in "drawing water up the mountain," which increased everyone's confidence. Then, they persuaded and mobilized the masses through them. The farmer Gao Yufu was ideologically unconvinced and disagreed with the canal passing through the edge of his land. The party branch found the person closest to Gao Yufu to persuade him, and immediately watered his land when the canal was built to the edge of his land. Only then did Gao Yufu believe in the benefits of building the canal and began to actively participate in the water conservancy project. In less than half a month, the village opened two canals and three slow-water dams, which irrigated forty-five mu of crops and more than four hundred fruit trees, and greatly increased production. The district committee used this typical pilot experience to educate the masses throughout the district about water conservancy construction and gradually promoted it. By 1955, thirty-eight canals and one hundred and twenty wells had been dug throughout the district, expanding the irrigated area by more than 5,000 mu.
    However, it was not enough to only solve the problems of fertilizer and water conservancy; it was also necessary to lead the masses to gradually change the old habits in the farming system that affected large-scale increases in production. In order to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production technology, in the spring of 1953, the district committee organized all district cadres to study the experience of increasing production in Zhaoyuan County, Northeast China. This study was very enlightening to the district committee, especially the experience of close planting in Zhaoyuan County, which made the district committee realize that it was necessary to gradually change the old habit of sparse planting among local farmers. Taking corn as an example, according to the old habits, only 1,700 to 1,800 plants were planted per mu, with a plant spacing of about two feet. Farmers even praised this unreasonable sparse planting: "Large ridges and thick steps, save effort in weeding, not less grain harvested, not less stalks produced." In order to gain experience in close planting, the district committee sent three district cadres to help three cooperatives with different soil qualities to conduct experiments on close planting with an increase in density of about 30%. In the experiment, the district committee paid attention to relying on the party branch to carry out the work. For example, in Dongxiaozhai Cooperative, most members were full of worries and unwilling to plant closely. The district committee mobilized five party members, including Wang Pu, through the branch to experiment with close planting. As a result, the five mu of sorghum planted closely averaged 162 catties per mu more than the sparsely planted sorghum. The experimental results proved that regardless of the soil quality, large increases in production could be achieved. As a result, close planting was gradually promoted throughout the district. Due to the gradual solution of fertilizer, water conservancy, and field management techniques, and the further increase in crop density, the yield of closely planted crops was further increased. Some corn increased density by 70% and increased yield by 180%. In 1954, there were 7,800 mu of crops planted closely throughout the district. In 1955, close planted crops increased to more than 38,700 mu, accounting for about 88% of the district's grain crop planting area. After the facts broke the farmers' conservative thinking on planting density, the farmers changed their original words praising sparse planting to criticizing sparse planting: "Large ridges and thick steps, not less effort wasted, grain must be less harvested, stalks are even less produced, calculate carefully, two mu are worth one mu."
    Because the district committee led the district to gradually realize cooperativization and implemented various production reforms, by 1955, the average yield per mu of land in the district increased from 125 catties in 1952 to 260 catties. In this way, the severe grain shortage in the district was fundamentally changed, the lives of the masses were significantly improved, and the purchasing power of the masses was greatly increased.

    一个善于进行具体领导的区委会
    周振华
    1953年，河北遵化县鸡鸣村区还是一个需要国家供应粮食一百六十三万斤的严重缺粮区，而到1955年秋天，不仅完全作到了粮食自给，而且还有了支援国家建设的部分余粮了。这个变化是怎样发生的呢？关键就在于这个区的中共区委会实行了具体深入的领导，贯彻执行了党的发展互助合作的政策和发展生产的政策。
    这个区1952年就试办了两个合作社，当时，不仅社干部和乡干部不懂怎样办社，连区干部也不懂。这样，在工作中当然会有不少困难，可是区委会不是躲避困难，而是努力去克服困难。区委会首先领导区干部学习党的互助合作政策，学习各地办社的经验，同时，成立了区的互助合作指导委员会，经常研究建社和办社中的具体问题。区委委员并分别深入到合作社里，了解情况，摸索经验，具体帮助社干部解决问题。这样，到1953年秋天，区上的二十五名干部都可以单独帮助社里处理问题了。可是，为了赶上合作社发展的需要，仅仅区干部会办社是不行的，还必须依靠和帮助乡支部培养大批乡干部和村干部来办社。区委会就采取了区干部重点示范、建立互助合作网、组织观摩以及小型训练班等等办法，对乡干部、村干部以及办社积极分子进行普遍的培养教育。到1955年初，全区基本上实现了合作化以后，不但全区四十一名驻乡干部都已变成办社的内行和半内行，而且全区375名支部书记和村主任等主要村级干部中，已有144名成为办社的内行，另外231名也都能够解决办社中的一般问题了。这就大大促进了全区合作社的巩固和生产的发展。
    随着合作社的发展，区委会也加强了对生产的具体领导，逐步解决了山区粮食增产的几个关键问题。首先是积肥问题。这个区多年以来没有大量积肥和施肥的习惯，平均每亩土地只施肥一千斤，全区还有30％左右的土地根本不施肥。区委会分析了施肥少的原因有二：一是不少农民还不相信大量施肥就能大量增产，二是全区缺乏肥源，不能大量积肥。区委会就一方面用大量施肥就能大量增产的实例向农民进行教育，另一方面帮助群众找寻大量积肥的办法。结果在强庄子村发现了一种积肥办法，就是利用山坡和地边的杂草沤火肥。区委会研究和总结了这一先进经验以后，马上在全区作了宣传和推广。接着又总结和推广了农民创造的修尿池、压绿肥、积小灰等各种积肥办法。这就从根本上解决了肥源缺乏的问题。到1955年，全区每亩土地的施肥量平均已达四千二百斤，比1952年提高了三倍多。
    在解决积肥问题的同时，区委会领导了全区的水利兴修工作。区委会首先在白马峪村进行兴修水利的试办工作。区委会协助该村党支部组织全体党员学习了全国造林模范袁世珍“引水上山”的先进经验，提高了大家的信心，然后通过他们去说服和动员群众。农民高玉富思想不通，不同意水渠在他的地边经过，党支部就找了和高玉富最亲近的人去说服了高玉富，并在水渠修到他的地边时，立即给他浇了地，高玉富这才相信了修水渠的好处，开始积极参加了兴修水利的工程。不到半个月，该村就开了两道水渠和三道缓水坝，使四十五亩庄稼和四百多棵果树得到了灌溉，并且大量增产。区委会就用这一典型试办的经验对全区群众进行兴修水利的教育，并且逐步加以推广。到1955年全区已开渠三十八道，打井一百二十眼，共扩大浇地面积五千多亩。
    但是，仅仅解决肥料和水利的问题还是不够的，还必须领导群众逐步改变影响大量增产的耕作制度上的旧习惯。为了加强对农业生产技术的领导，1953年春，区委会就组织全体区干部学习了东北肇源县的增产经验，这次学习对区委会有很大启示，特别是肇源县的密植经验，使区委会认识到必须逐步改变当地农民稀植的旧习惯。拿玉米来说，按照旧习惯，每亩只种一千七、八百棵，棵距是二尺左右。农民还这样称赞这种不合理的稀植：“垅大脚步粗，耪地省工夫，粮食不少打，秸杆不少出。”区委会为了取得密植的经验，就派了三个区干部，帮助三个土质不同的合作社，作了增加密度30％左右的密植的试验。在试验中，区委会注意依靠党支部来进行工作。如东小寨合作社，一般社员都顾虑重重，不愿密植，区委会通过支部动员了王朴等五名党员试验密植，结果五亩密植的高粱每亩平均比稀植增产一百六十二斤。试验结果证明，不管土质好坏，都能大量增产。于是，密植就在全区逐步推广开了。由于肥料、水利和田间管理技术的逐步解决，由于作物密度的进一步增加，密植作物的产量就更加提高了。有的玉米增加密度70％，提高产量180％。1954年全区已有七千八百亩作物密植，1955年密植作物更增加到三万八千七百多亩，约占全区粮食作物播种面积的88％。事实打破了农民在种植密度上的保守思想以后，农民就把原来赞扬稀植的话改成批评稀植的话：“垅大脚步粗，不少费工夫，粮食准少打，秸杆更少出，仔细算算账，两亩顶一亩。”
    由于区委会领导全区逐步实现了合作化，实行了各种生产改革，到1955年，全区土地的平均亩产量就由1952年的一百二十五斤增加到二百六十斤。这样，全区严重的缺粮状况根本改变了，群众的生活显著改善了，群众的购买力大大提高了。
