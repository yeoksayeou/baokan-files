    A Close-Knit United National Community
    Liu Xi, Xiu Zhen
    In Guizhou Province, there are many agricultural production cooperatives composed of various ethnic groups. Under the education of collectivism, the farmers of all ethnic groups who joined the cooperatives have become increasingly close-knit and united, improving production and consolidating the cooperatives. The Xinsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Baijin Township, Huishui Buyi and Miao Autonomous County, is one such example.
    This agricultural cooperative was established in the spring of 1954. The cooperative has twenty-six Miao member households and five Han member households. The members of the two ethnic groups have established a new relationship of mutual respect, love, learning, and assistance within the cooperative. Whether a member is building a house, constructing a stove, celebrating a wedding, or any other important event, everyone helps each other. The five Han member households were somewhat lacking in field production skills, so the Miao members taught them. Wang Xuerong, a Han member, hoed wheat with too closely spaced footsteps and too slowly, so the Miao members working with him taught him how to hoe wheat. Initially, he could only earn five or six work points a day, but later he earned nine. Wang Xuerong's wife was old and unable to do field work, so the cooperative cadres arranged for her to sew clothes and make shoes for the Miao members who couldn't do these things. She was very happy to have work in the cooperative. The Miao members were also able to free up more time to participate in field production, and they were also very happy.
    Peng Guoliang, a Han member, was not very good at field work and was unwilling to actively learn from others. He would work one day if he was happy and sleep all day if he was not. Some members were very displeased with this and advocated expelling him from the cooperative. Most of the Miao members disagreed with this. They said, "If he is not active in production, we should educate him to correct his ways." Therefore, the cooperative management committee assigned a special person to educate and help him. Everyone called him to the fields every day when they went to work; they taught him how to do the work he didn't know. Over time, he became much more diligent in his work. In 1955, he earned more than 200 catties of grain than in 1954. Seeing that his family's life was difficult, the members gave him a few extra yuan from the money earned from burning lime; at the same time, they criticized him for not being active enough in labor and encouraged him to work hard in the future. He was very grateful for everyone's help, and he became more active in manure accumulation and wheat hoeing.
    The women in this area are very capable of labor. But in the past, their labor income belonged to the family, and they had no right to dispose of it. Married women even had to ask their parents' families for clothes to wear. Now they can freely dispose of their labor income in the agricultural production cooperative. The cooperative also provides many benefits for female members. The cooperative stipulates that pregnant female members should not do heavy work, and according to the specific situation of each season, they are assigned some light work to do, such as applying manure, selecting seeds, planting seeds, drying grain, and taking care of children. Female members have one month of leave when they give birth; during the leave, the cooperative gives them fifteen work days so that they can rest and take care of their children.
    Last year, five women in the cooperative gave birth, and the production of male laborers in their families was not affected. This is because when a woman gave birth, the female cadres of the cooperative and other female members would take care of her, saving the male members a lot of worry. One morning in November last year, Shi Sanmei, a Han female member, was lying in bed, about to give birth, and her husband, Xu Deguang, was grazing cattle in the mountains, and there was no one at home to take care of her. Just then, Yang Xiuzhen (Miao), the female deputy director of the cooperative, came to see her. Yang Xiuzhen lit the stove in her house and ran to the district to get her a midwife. Shi Sanmei gave birth to a baby boy, and she and her husband were very grateful to Yang Xiuzhen for her warm care.

    一个亲密团结的民族联合社
    刘希　秀珍
    贵州省有很多由各民族联合组成的农业生产合作社。入社的各族农民，在集体主义的教育下，日益亲密团结，搞好了生产，巩固了合作社。惠水布依族、苗族自治县摆金乡新生农业合作社就是其中的一个。
    这个农业合作社是1954年春天建立的。全社有二十六户苗族社员、五户汉族社员。在社里两族社员建立起了互敬互爱、互相学习、互相帮助的新关系。不论哪家社员修房子、打灶、男婚、女嫁，一家有事，大家帮助。五户汉族社员在田间生产工作方面差一些，苗族社员就教他们。汉族社员王学荣锄麦的脚印太密，锄的也慢，同他一起做活的苗族社员就教给他锄麦的方法。最初他一天只能得五、六分，后来得到了九分。王学荣的老婆年纪大了，不能做田里的活，社干部就让她给不会缝衣服、做鞋子的苗族社员缝衣服、做鞋子。她在合作社里有了活干，很高兴。苗族社员也能够腾出更多的时间参加田间生产，也很高兴。
    汉族社员彭国亮，不大会做田里的活，又不愿积极向别人学习，高兴了做一天，不高兴了睡大觉。有的社员很看不惯，主张开除他出社。多数苗族社员都不同意这样做。他们说：“他生产不积极，要教育他改正。”于是社务管理委员会指定专人教育和帮助他。大家每天下田的时候，也招呼他下田；他不会做的活，教给他做。时间长了，他做活也勤快多了。他在1955年比1954年多收入了二百多斤粮食。社员们看到他家的生活困难，就把大家烧石灰赚的钱，多分了几元给他；同时也批评了他劳动还不够积极，鼓励他今后努力。他很感激大家对他的帮助，在积肥、锄麦当中，就更积极出工了。
    这一带的妇女都很能劳动。但是在过去，她们的劳动收入归家庭所有，自己没有支配的权利，出嫁的妇女穿件衣服还得向娘家要。现在她们在农业生产合作社里可以自由地支配自己的劳动所得了。社里对女社员还有很多照顾。社里规定不要怀孕的女社员做过重的活，根据每个季节的具体情况，分给她们一些轻活做，如淋粪、选种、点种、晒粮、看孩子等。女社员生孩子有一个月的假期；在假期中，社里给她们十五个劳动日，使她们安心休养和照顾孩子。
    去年社里有五个妇女生了孩子，她们家里男劳动力的生产都没有受到影响。这是因为哪个妇女生孩子，合作社的女干部和别的女社员就去照顾她，使男社员省了许多心。去年十一月的一天上午，汉族女社员石三妹躺在床上，眼看要生小孩了，她的丈夫徐得光在山上放牛，家里没有人照顾。正在这时候，合作社的女副主任杨秀珍（苗族）来看她了。杨秀珍给她家的炉灶生了火，就跑到区上给她请来了接生员。石三妹生了一个男孩子，她和她的丈夫都非常感激杨秀珍对他们的热情关怀。
