    A Simple and Effective Method for Treating Hemorrhoids
    Deng Xinli, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor in Chongqing, has developed a new method for treating hemorrhoids with very good results – alum compression therapy.
    Since January of this year, Deng Xinli has used this method to cure more than seventy hemorrhoid patients. In early February, Chongqing Second Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital also adopted this method. As of April 14, out of the eighty-one patients treated, sixty-five have been cured, and the rest are still undergoing treatment.
    The alum compression therapy procedure is very simple. According to the experience of Deng Xinli and others, simply inject 1 ml of 20% alum solution into the hemorrhoid to coagulate the blood inside the hemorrhoid. Then use hemostatic forceps to compress the hemorrhoid. After about ten minutes, its internal tissue will be completely destroyed and shrink into a thin paper-like state, unable to perform new metabolism. After three to seven days, the hemorrhoid will fall off on its own. The entire surgical procedure only takes about twenty minutes, and the patient experiences very little pain.

    一种简便有效的治疗痔核方法
    重庆市中医师邓辛犁研究出了一种治疗痔核效果很好的新方法——明矾压缩疗法。
    今年一月以来，邓辛犁试用这种方法治愈了七十多个痔核患者。二月初，重庆市第二中医院也采用了这种方法，到四月十四日止，治疗的八十一个病人中，已有六十五人痊愈，其余的还在继续治疗。
    明矾压缩疗法手续很简便，根据邓辛犁等的经验，只要用一毫升含量20％的明矾水注入痔核，使痔核内的血液凝固，再用止血钳压缩痔核，十分钟左右，其内部组织就全部被破坏，萎缩成薄纸状，不能再起新陈代谢作用。经过三天到七天，痔核就自行脱落。全部手术过程只需二十分钟左右，病人痛苦很轻。
