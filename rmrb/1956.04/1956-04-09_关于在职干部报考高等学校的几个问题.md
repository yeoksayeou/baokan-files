    Several Questions Regarding On-the-Job Cadres Applying for Higher Education Institutions

    Q: What is meant by free application? How should on-the-job cadres correctly approach free application?

    A: Free application means that any cadre who voluntarily wishes to pursue further education, as long as they are in good health, have a cultural level equivalent to high school graduation, and are under the age of thirty-five, can freely apply to higher education institutions. After they submit their application to the leaders of their work unit, the leaders should actively support and agree to their application and should not obstruct or refuse it. This year, higher education institutions have a large enrollment task, and the source of students is insufficient, so it is necessary to expand the source of students from all aspects. Experience over the past few years has proven that absorbing qualified on-the-job cadres is not only an effective way to train and improve cadres, but also an important aspect of increasing the source of students for higher education institutions. To give on-the-job cadres ample opportunity to apply to higher education institutions, a free application method is adopted for on-the-job cadres in Party and government organs, institutions, enterprises, and mass organizations. However, in factories, mines, enterprises, and health systems, etc., due to the tight schedule, the method of planned selection and application by leading organs is adopted to prevent production and work from being affected.

    Many on-the-job cadres are very excited after seeing this year's enrollment plan, and some are already reviewing their lessons in preparation for the exam. However, some people still have some ideological concerns about further education: In the case of busy work in the organs, will applying for university be seen as "individualism" and "not focusing on work"? Will they be ridiculed if they fail to get into school? These concerns are unnecessary. Because their desire to apply to higher education institutions is in line with the needs of national construction. We must bring our country's scientific and cultural undertakings up to the advanced international level within twelve years; and the existing scientific and technological forces and cadres in all aspects are far from sufficient in both quality and quantity to meet the needs of construction and development. The Party calls on young people to march towards science. On-the-job cadres should first actively respond to the Party's call, break through various concerns, master scientific knowledge and advanced technology, and accelerate the process of socialism. Therefore, it is completely right for cadres who meet the conditions for further education to request further education. The view that requesting further education is "individualism" is extremely incorrect. However, when preparing to apply, on-the-job cadres must realistically consider whether their health, cultural level, etc., meet the conditions for applying to higher education institutions, and then decide whether to apply.

    Q: How should organs and organizations treat the free application of on-the-job cadres?

    A: According to the application situation in previous years, many units were able to consider the overall interests of the country and selected a group of qualified cadres to enter school; however, many units adopted a delaying and indifferent attitude towards cadres who requested further education, and even ridiculed and attacked them, which is very wrong. These units often use the need for work as a reason not to allow cadres to apply to higher education institutions, but in fact, there are some cadres in the organs who do very little work. This situation may have changed after most units have streamlined their organizations and reorganized their staffing; however, as long as work methods are improved, work efficiency is increased, conservative ideas are overcome, and potential strengths are brought into play, it is still possible to extract those who meet the conditions for further education to study. Some units often easily label cadres who request further education with some inappropriate labels, which is wrong. It should be known that the active desire of on-the-job cadres to study is a valuable enthusiasm and a manifestation of a spirit of enterprise. Leaders should actively encourage and support it; even if they are not admitted, leaders should adopt a caring attitude and should never discriminate against them.

    The quantity and quality of students enrolled by higher education institutions this year will directly affect the construction of our country's third five-year plan. All units must consider the long-term interests of the country and actively select qualified cadres for further education to cultivate senior construction talents for the country. Any departmentalism that only takes care of the immediate interests of the unit is wrong.

    Q: How should on-the-job cadres preparing for further education solve the problem of reviewing their lessons?

    A: On-the-job cadres are usually busy with work, and they have generally been away from school for a long time. Some of the lessons they learned in the past have been forgotten. If they are not given time to review their lessons, they will definitely encounter great difficulties in the exam. Leaders of all units should understand this situation and give them time to review their lessons. To give them more opportunities for admission, cadres preparing to take the exam should be given at least three months to review their lessons. Generally speaking, a semi-detached learning method should be adopted as much as possible. The past practice of some units only allowing application but not giving time for review must be changed. At present, many cities have opened remedial schools or classes for high school students who have suspended their studies and are waiting for employment. If the units where on-the-job cadres are located do not have the conditions to organize remedial classes separately, they can participate in the study with a letter of introduction issued by the work unit. Regions that have not yet established such remedial schools (classes) should be established as soon as possible. Regions with poor conditions can also use self-study groups and other forms to organize cadre learning. Local education departments should conscientiously do a good job in organizing and leading this work. Units with a large number of applicants can try to run their own remedial classes.

    Q: What are the procedures, travel expenses, and treatment after admission for on-the-job cadres applying to higher education institutions?

    A: When on-the-job cadres apply to higher education institutions, they only need a letter of introduction from the leadership. They only need to go through the resignation procedures after they pass the exam and are admitted to the school. If they are not admitted, they will continue to work in their original unit. The State Council has stipulated that the travel expenses for applying for the exam and reporting to the school after admission shall be borne by the original work unit. As for the treatment of on-the-job cadres after admission, according to regulations, those who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years can enjoy the treatment of financial aid for cadres. Those who have not worked for three years and have economic difficulties can apply for general student financial aid.

### 关于在职干部报考高等学校的几个问题

    关于在职干部报考高等学校的几个问题
    问：什么叫自由报考？在职干部应该如何正确地对待自由报考？
    答：自由报考的意思就是：凡自愿升学的干部，只要身体健康，相当高中毕业的文化程度和年龄在三十五岁以下，就可以自由报考高等学校。他本人向所在单位领导方面提出报考高等学校的要求后，领导方面应当积极支持同意他们报考，不得阻挠和拒绝。今年高等学校招生任务很大，学生来源又不足，这就必须从各方面扩大学生的来源。过去几年来的经验证明：吸收合格的在职干部入学，不仅是培养提高干部的有效办法，也是增加高等学校学生来源的一个重要方面。为了让在职干部有充分的报考高等学校的机会，所以对党政机关、事业和企业单位、群众团体等的在职干部采取自由报考的办法。但是，在厂矿企业和卫生系统等机关中，由于任务较紧，为了使生产和工作不致受到影响，所以采用由领导机关计划抽调报考的办法。
    很多在职干部看到今年的招生计划，十分兴奋，有的已经在复习功课，准备应考。但是，也有些人在升学问题上还有一些思想顾虑：在机关工作繁忙的情况下，提出报考大学，会不会被人看做“个人主义”和“不安心工作”呢？如果考不上学校是不是会受到人家讥笑呢？这些顾虑都是不必要的。因为他们报考高等学校的愿望，是符合国家建设需要的。我们要在十二年内使我国的科学文化事业赶上国际的先进水平；而现有的科学技术力量和各方面的干部，无论在质量和数量上，已远不足以适应建设发展的需要。党号召青年向科学进军，在职干部应该首先积极响应党的号召，打破各种顾虑，去掌握科学知识和先进技术，加速社会主义的进程。因此，凡具有升学条件的干部要求升学是完全应该的。那种认为要求升学就是“个人主义”的看法是极不正确的。不过，在职干部在准备报考的时候，必须实事求是地考虑到自己的健康情况、文化程度等是否合乎高等学校报考的条件，然后再决定自己是否提出升学的要求。
    问：机关、团体应该怎样对待在职干部的自由报考？
    答：根据往年报考的情况，很多单位都能考虑到国家的整体利益，选送了一批合格的干部入学；但是也有不少单位对要求升学的干部采取拖延、冷淡的态度，甚至加以讽刺、打击，这是非常错误的。这些单位往往以工作需要为理由不让干部报考高等学校，实际上机关里却有一些干部工作很少。今年大多数单位经过精简机构、整顿编制的工作，这种情况可能有所改变；但是只要改进工作方法，提高工作效率，克服保守思想，发挥潜在力量，那么抽出那些具有升学条件的人去学习也还是可以的。有些单位对要求升学的干部经常轻易扣上一些不适当的帽子，这是不对的。须知在职干部积极要求学习，这是一种可贵的热情，是一种进取精神的表现，领导方面应该积极地加以鼓励和支持；即使他们没有被录取，领导方面也应该采取关怀的态度，而决不应该加以歧视。
    今年高等学校招收的学生的数量和质量上都将直接影响到我国第三个五年计划的建设，各单位必须从国家长远的利益考虑，为国家培养高级建设人材积极选送合乎条件的干部升学，任何只顾到本单位眼前利益的本位主义作法都是不对的。
    问：准备升学的在职干部应当如何解决复习功课的问题？
    答：在职干部平时忙于工作，一般离开学校时间较久，过去所学的功课有的已经遗忘，如果不给予复习功课的时间，在考试中一定会遇到很大的困难。各单位领导方面应该了解到这种情况，给予复习功课的时间。为了使他们有较多的录取机会，对准备参加考试的干部，至少要给三个月复习功课的时间，一般地说，尽可能采取半脱产的学习方法。必须改变过去有些单位只允许报考，不给复习时间的作法。目前很多城市已开办了停学待业高中学生补习学校或补习班，如果在职干部的所在单位没有条件单独组织补习，可由工作单位开具介绍函件去参加学习。还没有设立这类补习学校（班）的地区应该尽速设立，条件较差的地区也可采用自学小组等形式来组织干部学习。各地教育部门应该认真做好这一工作的组织和领导。报考人数较多的单位可以设法自己举办补习班。
    问：在职干部报考高等学校的手续、路费和入学后的待遇怎样？
    答：在职干部报考高等学校时只需领导上开具报考的介绍信，待考试合格录取入学时再办理离职手续。如果没有被录取，一律仍在原单位工作。报考和录取赴校报到的路费等，国务院已规定均由原工作单位负责解决。至于在职干部入学后的待遇问题，按规定凡参加革命工作满三年的，可以享受调干助学金待遇，未满三年经济有困难的，可申请一般学生助学金。
