Mr. Chairman, Friends:
    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, I am particularly honored to convey the congratulations of the Pakistan Association of Scientific Workers as its president, and to convey the congratulations of the Pakistan Association for the Advancement of Science as its secretary-general. We are particularly pleased that this commemorative conference is being held in a great Asian country, which not only possesses one of the oldest cultures and civilizations in the world, but is once again leading the Asian people, pointing out the path to quickly reorganize people's cultural and material lives, and achieving a high standard of living in a very short period of time according to modern standards. Pakistani scientists in both associations are very happy on this day because the World Federation of Scientific Workers has made various contributions in promoting the ideas that "science must be used to serve mankind" and that "the development of science must be for the moral and material progress of mankind." We are also pleased with all the achievements of the World Federation of Scientific Workers in striving to improve the living conditions of scientists in their own countries. Finally, and equally important, we are also pleased with the efforts of the World Federation of Scientific Workers in maintaining and defending world peace.
    The Pakistan Association of Scientific Workers, since its establishment, has taken the improvement of the social status and economic conditions of scientific workers as its primary purpose. It encourages scientific workers to step out of their ivory towers and integrate more with the surrounding social forces. The Pakistan Association for the Advancement of Science has been working for the popularization of science and the effective use of science to solve pressing national economic problems. It holds an annual scientific conference in various parts of our country, attended not only by scientists from various groups, universities, government, scientific research institutes and private industries in Pakistan, but also by well-known foreign scientists. These conferences focus on discussing major national issues and how science can solve these problems. To promote the realization of these goals, the Pakistan Association for the Advancement of Science publishes two publications – "Pakistan Science" and "Pakistan Journal of Scientific Research."
    The Pakistani government is fully aware of the need to develop science for the benefit of national progress, and despite some difficulties, it is doing its best to promote science and scientific research. Through the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, established three years ago, a large amount of money is being used to promote and encourage scientific research related to the industrial development of our country and the most economical utilization of our natural resources, according to the country's resources. Four national research laboratories have been initially established, and they are growing rapidly due to the government providing all possible conditions. Through the Council, researchers can obtain funding at any time, regardless of which research institution they belong to or what kind of scientific investigation they wish to engage in.
    With all these convenient conditions, Pakistani scientific workers are beginning to feel that they can make a difference, and it is now up to them to show what they can do for the development and progress of the country through science. Faced with this challenge, the salaries, social conditions, and economic conditions of scientific workers have been somewhat relegated to secondary importance. I must admit that these situations are still undesirable, but scientific workers feel that they must sacrifice personal interests and work hard and demonstrate positive achievements for the development and progress of the country through science. However, due to the establishment of the Council, some work has been done to improve the economic conditions of scientific workers. The Council pays scientific workers much higher salaries than universities and other scientific research institutions. It is hoped that this example will be followed by other institutions, and that in the near future, the economic conditions of scientific workers nationwide will be comprehensively improved, although their social status may not necessarily improve.
    Since this idea prevails among scientific workers in our country, there is no doubt that their responsibilities and obligations in many aspects are even greater. Several speakers before me have mentioned the social responsibility of scientists, and for all of us Asian countries, even this responsibility is even greater.
    In our society, scientists seem to have social responsibilities of particular significance, the most important of which is to publicize as much as possible the spirit of science – that is, the spirit of genuine exploration regardless of consequences and the unremitting pursuit of truth. Considering all our problems with the objective spirit of science, and creating a scientific attitude of mind in our society, are all things that are of great importance to us. Scientists have a responsibility to develop and develop national resources, to provide more food, better clothes and housing, better health conditions, and a comprehensive improvement in the standard of living for all the people. This responsibility is second only to the main responsibility I just mentioned.
    Mr. Chairman, we attach great importance to our relationship with the World Federation of Scientific Workers. The World Federation of Scientific Workers is a source of encouragement and guidance that we often obtain. On behalf of our two associations, I would like to once again extend our most sincere congratulations to you.

### 巴基斯坦贝书尔·阿梅特博士的发言

专栏：

    巴基斯坦贝书尔·阿梅特博士的发言主席先生，诸位朋友：
    值此庆祝世界科学工作者协会成立十周年之际，我特别荣幸地以巴基斯坦科学工作者协会主席的身份向你们传达该协会的祝贺，并以巴基斯坦科学促进协会秘书长的身份传达该协会向你们的祝贺。我们特别高兴的是这个纪念大会是在一个伟大的亚洲国家召开的，这个国家不但有着世界上最古老的文化和文明，而且再度领导着亚洲人民，指出迅速重新组织人民的文化生活和物质生活的道路，并在很短的时期中根据现代标准达到高度的生活水平。这两个协会中的巴基斯坦科学家们在这个日子里感到非常高兴，因为世界科协在促进“科学必须用来服务于人类”以及“科学的发展必须为了人类的道德和物质进步”这些思想方面，作出了种种贡献。我们还为世界科协在争取改善科学家在本国社会里的生活条件方面的一切成就感到高兴。最后，同样重要的是，我们还为世界科协在维护和保卫世界和平方面的努力，感到高兴。
    巴基斯坦科学工作者协会自从成立以来就以改善科学工作者的社会地位和经济条件为主要目的。它鼓励着科学工作者们走出象牙之塔，并使他们更多地和周围的社会力量打成一片。巴基斯坦科学促进协会一直为科学的普及和科学的有效地用于解决迫切的国民经济问题进行工作。它每年在我国各地召开一次科学年会，参加者不仅有巴基斯坦各团体组织、大学、政府、科学研究所和私营工业中的科学家们，而且有外国的著名科学家。这种会议集中地讨论着国家的重大问题以及科学如何来解决这些问题的办法。为了促进这些目的的实现，巴基斯坦科学促进协会出版了两种刊物——“巴基斯坦科学”和“巴基斯坦科学研究”。
    巴基斯坦政府充分感到发展科学以利国家进步的需要，尽管有一些困难，它还是在尽力促进科学和科学研究。通过三年前成立的科学和工业研究理事会，按照国家资源的情况，大量的金钱正在用来推进和鼓励有关我国工业发展和最经济地利用我国自然资源的科学研究。四个国立的研究实验室已经初步建立起来，由于政府提供了一切可能提供的条件，它们正在迅速地成长起来。通过该理事会，研究人员随时能获得经费，不论他们属于那一个研究机构，也不论他们希望从事于何种科学调查。
    有了这一切便利的条件，巴基斯坦的科学工作者们开始感到是可以有所作为了，现在就在于他们来表明，通过科学，他们能为国家的发展和进步做些什么。面对着这种挑战，科学工作者的薪水，社会条件和经济条件都多少放到了次要的地位。我必须承认这些情况还是不应有的，但是科学工作者们感到他们必须牺牲个人利益，并通过科学为国家的发展和进步努力工作和表现出积极的成就。然而，由于理事会的成立，在改善科学工作者的经济条件方面已经作了一些工作。理事会付给科学工作者的薪水要比各大学和其他科学研究机构多得多。人们希望，这个榜样会被其他机构仿效，在不久的将来，全国科学工作者的经济条件会得到全面的改善，虽然他们的社会地位或许不一定改善。
    由于这个思想在我国科学工作者当中是占优势的，毫无疑问，他们在许多方面的责任和义务就更重大了。前面的几位发言人都提到科学家的社会责任，对我们所有亚洲国家来说，甚至这种责任也更为重大一些。
    在我国社会里，科学家们似乎具有特殊意义的社会责任，其中最主要的是尽可能地宣传科学的精神——即不问后果的真正探讨的精神和不懈的追求真理的精神。以科学的客观精神考虑我们一切问题，在我们的社会里创造一种思想上的科学态度，这都是和我们有极大关系的事情。科学家在开发和发展国家资源上有责任，以向全体人民提供更多的粮食，更好的衣服和房屋，更好的健康条件，和全面提高的生活水平，这个责任仅次于我刚才提到的主要责任。
    主席先生，我们极为重视我们与世界科学工作者协会的关系，世界科协是我们经常获得鼓舞和指导的泉源。我谨代表我们的两个协会再一次向你们致以最衷心的祝贺。
