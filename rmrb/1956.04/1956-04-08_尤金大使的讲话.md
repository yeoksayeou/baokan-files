Ambassador Yudin's Speech

Dear Comrades and Friends:

First of all, please allow me to welcome you, all the dear guests who have come to attend the banquet held today in welcome of the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, on their visit to the People's Republic of China.

This visit will further strengthen the unbreakable friendship between the two great peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

Our political, economic, and cultural ties are growing and strengthening day by day. The foundation of the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China lies in the commonality of our goals in the struggle to build a socialist society in China and a communist society in the Soviet Union as quickly as possible, and to strive for peace among all nations.

The peoples and governments of the Soviet Union and China are filled with the firm determination to do everything in their power to ensure peace and the security of all nations. In our foreign policy, we resolutely advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The people of the world also join us in advocating peaceful coexistence, opposing war, and opposing the conspiracies of warmongers. It is precisely for this reason that we say with confidence: the people of all countries are capable of stopping the outbreak of war.

The close friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China is a reliable guarantee for consolidating peace.

I propose a toast to the further strengthening of the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the two great peoples of the Soviet Union and China!

    亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    首先请允许我向你们、今天来参加为欢迎以苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬同志为首的苏联政府代表团访问中华人民共和国而举行的宴会的所有亲爱的来宾表示欢迎。
    这次访问将进一步加强苏联和中华人民共和国两国伟大人民间牢不可破的友谊。
    我们两国间政治、经济和文化联系正在日益增进和加强。苏、中两国人民间牢不可破的友谊的基础是在为争取最迅速地在中国建设社会主义社会和在苏联建设共产主义社会并为争取各国间的和平所进行的斗争中我们目标的一致性。
    苏、中两国人民和政府满怀着坚定的决心要尽自己一切的力量来保障和平和各国人民的安全。我们在对外政策上坚决主张不同社会制度的各国和平共处。世界各国人民也和我们一起主张和平共处、反对战争、反对战争挑拨者的阴谋。正因为如此，我们满怀信心地说：各国人民是能够制止战争爆发的。
    苏、中两国人民的亲密友谊是巩固和平的可靠保证。
    我提议为苏、中两国伟大人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊进一步加强而干杯！
