    The First National Congress of People's Police and Public Security Committee Model Heroes has concluded victoriously. This meeting was the first victorious gathering of model heroes from the national public security front, and a general review of national public security work. Through this meeting, we have learned a great deal of knowledge about the struggle against the enemy and further improved our revolutionary vigilance, and will establish more achievements in safeguarding the great socialist cause of the motherland.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the support of the broad masses, the national People's Police and Public Security Committees, together with all public security personnel, have carried out heroic struggles against the enemies of the people and various disasters and accidents. They have played an important role in consolidating the people's democratic power, maintaining social order in urban and rural areas, and protecting the lives and property of the people, and have made outstanding contributions to defending the motherland and the socialist construction cause. In their struggle against the enemies of the motherland and the people, and in their struggle against various disasters, they have shown infinite loyalty to the Party, the motherland, and the people, and a lofty sense of responsibility for the cause of socialist construction, and have emerged in the struggle with many heroes and models. These heroes and models, who come from the people, have close ties with the people, and serve the people wholeheartedly, have set a glorious example for all public security personnel and the broad masses of the people with their heroic deeds, and have concentratedly demonstrated the noble qualities of the People's Police and public security personnel in loving the motherland, loving the people, and loving their work, and the heroic spirit and dauntless spirit of bravely and tenaciously fighting against the enemies of the motherland and the people in order to defend the motherland and defend the socialist construction cause.
    At present, our country is in the high tide of the socialist revolution, and the people of the whole country are striving with full confidence to accelerate socialist construction and socialist transformation, and to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The task facing public security work is to continue to strengthen public security work, vigorously crack down on the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and various criminal elements, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation. In carrying out these tasks, the People's Police and Public Security Committees bear a major responsibility. They are the bridge between the specialized work of public security organs and the mass struggle against the enemy, and the backbone force that directly leads the broad masses to actively participate in the struggle against the enemy. In the historical task of defending socialist construction and socialist transformation, they will continue to excellently complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party and the state.
    Due to the great victory of the socialist construction and socialist transformation cause, the heavy blow to the enemy by the past suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the appeal of the Party and the government's policy of "combining suppression with leniency," and the continuous improvement of the masses' class consciousness and revolutionary vigilance, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have shown a dramatic differentiation and disintegration. Especially since the promulgation of the "National Agricultural Development Program" (draft) and the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, the enemy's differentiation and disintegration has become more obvious. Some counter-revolutionaries with major crimes in history and special agents newly dispatched to our mainland by the enemy have also begun to abandon their reactionary stance and surrender to the People's Government. We must fully recognize this new situation. Correctly implement the policy of "combining suppression with leniency" in our work, promote greater differentiation and disintegration of the enemy, and strive for more counter-revolutionaries to abandon their reactionary stance and surrender to the People's Government, in order to further isolate, weaken, and disintegrate the enemy.
    At the same time, we must not forget for a minute: imperialism still stands before us, our territory of Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and the enemy will continue to send spies and special agents to harm us; the remaining resolute counter-revolutionaries in the country, their activities will become more and more concealed, and their means of sabotage will become more and more cunning. Whether it is an enemy hidden inside or an enemy newly sent in from outside, as long as they have not abandoned their reactionary stance, they will never give up their attempts to hinder and sabotage our great socialist construction cause. The struggle between the enemy and ourselves is still complex and arduous. Therefore, we cannot relax our vigilance in the slightest, but must be more vigilant in exposing the more deeply hidden spies and special agents. As long as the enemy does not surrender, it must be eliminated!
    The People's Police and Public Security Committee model heroes have made contributions to the motherland and the people in the cause of safeguarding the socialist revolution in the past. In the future, they should continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, study hard, improve their political awareness, cultural level, and professional skills, and under the leadership of the Party and the government, maintain closer ties with the masses, and strive to eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionaries and various criminal elements, in the struggle against various disasters and accidents, and make greater achievements in defending the great socialist construction cause of the motherland, always be good servants of the people, do more good things for the masses, and make greater contributions to the motherland and the people.
    All public security personnel and the broad masses should learn from the model heroes on the public security front. Learn from their noble qualities of loving the motherland, loving the people, and loving socialist construction. Learn from their spirit of not fearing difficulties and hardships and bravely fighting against the enemy. Learn from their ability to identify and judge the enemy and strike at all enemies who dare to undermine our cause, and strive to defend the great socialist construction cause of the motherland.

### 学习功臣模范的优良品质  加强治安保卫工作

    学习功臣模范的优良品质  加强治安保卫工作
    第一次全国人民警察、治安保卫委员功臣模范代表大会胜利闭幕了。这次会议是全国治安保卫战线上的功臣模范们的第一次胜利大会师，是全国治安保卫工作的总检阅。通过这次会议，我们学习到了很多的对敌斗争知识，进一步提高了革命警惕性，将在保卫祖国伟大的社会主义事业中建立更多的功勋。
    几年来，全国人民警察和治安保卫委员在党和政府的领导下，在广大群众的支持下，在公安机关的直接指挥下，同全体公安保卫人员一道，对人民的敌人和各种灾害事故进行了英勇的斗争，对巩固人民民主政权，维护城乡社会治安，保卫人民的生命财产起了重要作用，为保卫祖国保卫社会主义建设事业作出了卓越的贡献。他们在与祖国和人民的敌人的斗争中，在与各种灾害的斗争中，对党、对祖国和人民表现了无限的忠诚，对社会主义建设事业表现了崇高的责任感，并在斗争中涌现出了许许多多的功臣和模范。这些来自人民、与人民有着密切联系并全心全意为人民服务的功臣模范们，以其英雄事迹为全体公安人员和广大人民群众树立了光辉的榜样，并且集中地表现了人民警察和治安保卫人员热爱祖国、热爱人民、热爱自己工作的高贵品质，和为保卫祖国、保卫社会主义建设事业而与祖国和人民的敌人英勇顽强斗争的英雄气概和大无畏精神。
    现在，我国正处在社会主义革命高潮中，全国人民正在满怀信心地为加速社会主义建设和社会主义改造，提前完成五年计划而努力奋斗。摆在公安工作面前的任务，是继续加强公安保卫工作，有力地打击反革命分子和各种刑事犯罪分子的破坏活动，保障社会主义建设和社会主义改造的顺利进行。在执行这些任务中，人民警察和治安保卫委员负着重大责任，他们是公安机关的专门工作和群众性对敌斗争相结合的桥梁，是直接带动广大群众积极参加对敌斗争的骨干力量；在保卫社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的历史任务中，他们将继续卓越地完成党和国家交给的光荣任务。
    由于社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业所取得的伟大胜利，由于过去镇压反革命运动给予敌人的沉重打击，由于党和政府的“镇压与宽大相结合”的政策的感召力，由于群众阶级觉悟和革命警惕性的不断提高，残余反革命势力已经呈现剧烈的分化和瓦解状态。尤其是从“全国农业发展纲要”（草案）公布和政协第二届全国委员会第二次会议以后，敌人的分化瓦解的情况更加明显。有些在历史上有重大罪行的反革命分子和敌人新派遣到我国大陆上的特务分子也开始放弃反动立场，向人民政府投案自首了。我们必须充分认识到这种新的形势。在工作中正确地贯彻执行“镇压与宽大相结合”的政策，促使敌人更大的分化和瓦解，争取更多的反革命分子放弃反动立场向人民政府投案自首，以进一步孤立削弱和瓦解敌人。
    同时，一分钟也不能忘记：我们面前还站着帝国主义，我们的国土台湾还没有解放，敌人还会继续派遣间谍特务分子来危害我们；国内残余的坚决的反革命分子，他们的活动也会越来越隐蔽，他们的破坏手段会越来越狡猾。无论是内部暗藏的敌人，或是由外面新派进来的敌人，只要他们还没有放弃反动立场，就绝不会放弃他们阻碍和破坏我们伟大社会主义建设事业的企图。敌我斗争仍然是复杂的、艰巨的。因此，我们丝毫不能放松警惕，而要更加警觉地来揭露隐藏得更深的间谍特务分子。只要敌人不投降，就一定要消灭它！
    人民警察和治安保卫委员功臣模范们，过去在保卫社会主义革命事业中为祖国、为人民立了功。今后应该继续发扬爱国主义精神和革命英雄主义精神，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，努力学习，提高政治觉悟、文化水平和业务水平，在党和政府的领导下，更加密切联系群众，争取在肃清残余反革命分子和各种刑事犯罪分子斗争中，在与各种灾害事故的斗争中，在保卫祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业中做出更大的成绩，永远做人民的好勤务员，尽力给群众办更多的好事，为祖国和人民立更大的功劳。
    全国公安人员和广大群众应该向治安保卫战线上的功臣模范们学习。学习他们热爱祖国、热爱人民、热爱社会主义建设的高贵品质。学习他们不怕艰难困苦、英勇对敌斗争的精神。学习他们善于识别和判断敌人的能力，打击一切敢于破坏我们事业的敌人，为保卫祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业而奋斗。
