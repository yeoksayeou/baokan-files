The State Council issued a notice in early April regarding the protection of cultural relics in agricultural production and construction.

The notice states that in the high tide of national agricultural production, various agricultural construction projects such as drilling wells, opening canals, digging ponds, building dams, reclaiming wasteland, building roads, and leveling land are proceeding rapidly and extensively. Because China has a long history, revolutionary sites, ancient cultural ruins, ancient tombs, ancient buildings, steles, and ancient biological fossils that are preserved above and below ground are scattered throughout the country. People's committees at all levels must, under the principle of not affecting production and construction and protecting cultural relics, take emergency measures, vigorously publicize, and carry out mass cultural relic protection work in agricultural production and construction.

The notice stipulates that people's committees at all levels must pay attention to cultural relic protection work when conducting comprehensive rural construction planning and incorporate this work into the plan. All known revolutionary sites, ancient cultural ruins, ancient tombs, ancient buildings, and steles should be resolutely preserved if they do not interfere with production and construction. If they hinder production and construction but are of great value, they should be incorporated into rural greening or other construction plans for preservation and utilization as much as possible. Many regions across the country have been identified as revolutionary sites and important ancient cultural ruins, as well as locations with important commemorative value from past revolutionary wars. When planning basic agricultural construction in the above-mentioned locations, the consent of the Ministry of Culture must be obtained to avoid damage to the sites. The cultural bureaus of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should prepare a certain amount of manpower to carry out emergency clearing, excavation, demolition, or relocation work at any time for general ancient cultural ruins, ancient tombs, ancient buildings, and steles that genuinely interfere with agricultural production and construction.

The notice also emphasizes that a universal survey of historical and revolutionary cultural relics and sites must be conducted nationwide. The cultural bureaus of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should first submit a list of protection units for known ancient cultural ruins, ancient tomb areas, and important revolutionary sites, commemorative buildings, ancient buildings, steles, etc., to the Ministry of Culture for summary review, and gradually supplement them during the census process, and report them to the State Council in batches and stages for approval and placement under state protection.

    国务院通知各地注意在农业生产建设中保护文物
    国务院在四月上旬发出关于在农业生产建设中保护文物的通知。
    通知说，在全国农业生产的高潮中，打井、开渠、挖塘、修坝、开荒、筑路、平整土地等各项农业建设正在迅速而广泛地进行。由于我国历史悠久，被保存在地上地下的革命遗迹、古代文化遗址、古墓葬、古建筑、碑碣、古生物化石遍布全国。地方各级人民委员会必须在既不影响生产建设、又使文物得到保护的原则下，采取紧急措施，大力宣传，在农业生产建设中开展群众性的文物保护工作。
    通知规定：地方各级人民委员会在进行农村建设全面规划中，必须注意到文物保护工作，并且把这项工作纳入规划之中。一切已知的革命遗迹、古代文化遗址、古墓葬、古建筑、碑碣，如果同生产建设没有妨碍，就应该坚决保存。如果有碍生产建设，但是本身价值重大，应该尽可能纳入农村绿化或其他建设的规划加以保存和利用。全国有很多地区已经确定是革命遗迹和重要的古代文化遗址，以及历次革命战争中有重要纪念价值的地点。在上述地址进行农业生产基本建设规划的时候，必须征得文化部同意，以避免遗址的破坏。各省、自治区、直辖市文化局对于在农业生产建设中确实有妨碍的一般性的古代文化遗址、古墓葬、古建筑、碑碣，应该准备一定人力，随时进行紧急性的清理、发掘工作或拆除、迁移工作。
    通知还强调指出，必须在全国范围内对历史和革命文物遗迹进行普遍调查工作，各省、自治区、直辖市文化局应该首先就已知的古文化遗址、古墓葬地区和重要革命遗迹、纪念建筑物、古建筑、碑碣等提出保护单位名单，上报文化部汇总审核，并且在普查过程中逐步补充，分批分期地由文化部报告国务院批准，置于国家保护之列。    （新华社）
