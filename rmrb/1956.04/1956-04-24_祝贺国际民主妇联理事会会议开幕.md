    Congratulations on the Opening of the International Democratic Women's Federation Council Meeting

    The Beijing meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation Council opens today. In addition to the council members from various countries, prominent women from all over the world, especially representatives of women from Asia and Africa, have been invited to attend. This is the first time that the International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting has been held in an Asian country. This fact in itself demonstrates the sincere concern and support of the International Democratic Women's Federation for the wishes and activities of women in Asian and African countries. There is no doubt that the holding of the International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting in Beijing is an encouragement to women in Asian and African countries. We, the women and people of China, warmly welcome the convening of this meeting and sincerely wish the meeting success!

    World peace, women's rights, and children's happiness are the common aspirations of all women and mothers in the world, and are completely consistent with the fundamental interests of the people of all countries. Mothers nurture life and have even more the right and responsibility to protect life. Women's rights and children's happiness are closely linked to the cause of mankind's opposition to war, defense of world peace, opposition to colonial rule, and the maintenance of national independence, freedom, and prosperous national economic and cultural development. Women in various countries have shown increasing enthusiasm in opposing war, opposing aggressive military blocs, opposing the use of atomic weapons, demanding disarmament by all countries, and demanding negotiated solutions to international disputes. The struggle of women in various countries to maintain peace has played an indispensable role in promoting the easing of the international situation. It is inconceivable that the cause of mankind's striving for peace and happiness can be victorious without the participation of women.

    Since its establishment in 1945, the International Democratic Women's Federation has consistently striven tirelessly to defend peace and protect the cause of women's rights and children's happiness. It has also consistently supported the cause of Asian and African women in defending national independence, women's rights, and children's happiness. Women from countries with different social systems, different races, different beliefs, and different classes are increasingly united around the International Democratic Women's Federation. In the struggle to maintain world peace, the International Democratic Women's Federation has actively carried out work. In order to improve the lives and circumstances of women and children, the four international conferences hosted or initiated by the International Democratic Women's Federation have not only been deeply supported by women's member organizations in various countries, but have also won the cooperation and support of many non-member women's organizations or individuals.

    Thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples, the current international tension has been further eased. The principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems has been accepted by many countries and people of different classes as a guideline for international relations. Economic and cultural exchanges between countries with different systems have seen significant development in recent years. The open and bloody rule of colonialism and the United States' policy of piecing together military blocs have been strongly criticized by the people of the world, especially the people of Asian and African countries. The gradual convergence of positions on disarmament issues among major powers has created a realistic prospect for resolving the disarmament issue. Under this situation, all peace-loving international organizations and social groups in various countries that reflect public demands, establish effective mutual contacts, take coordinated actions, and hold high the banner of opposing the danger of war and striving for international peace and cooperation, have the power to turn the hope of world peace into reality. The International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting, held under this situation, issues a call to women all over the world to take more forceful action, which will attract more extensive cooperation and unity among women's organizations and women of all strata in various countries to fight for the realization of women's common aspirations. At this meeting, the wishes and actions of women in Asian and African countries will be valued and supported, which is in line with the current situation in which Asian, African and world people are fighting to eradicate the shameful colonialism. Although the current situation of women in Asian and African countries is somewhat different, due to past common experiences and struggles, the common demands are for national independence and peaceful friendship, for the development of their own economic and cultural development, and for improving the lives of women and children. Through this meeting, women in Asian and African countries will increase mutual understanding and friendship, and further develop friendly cooperation.

    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation has already extended an invitation to the council members from various countries who have come to participate in the meeting to visit various parts of our country after the meeting, and to meet with women and people of all nationalities and from all walks of life in our country. It is believed that they will be warmly welcomed by the women and people of our country. Our women and people have always hoped to increase mutual understanding with women and people from various countries, establish better friendly cooperative relations, exchange views on various national tasks and women's activities, learn from each other's beneficial experiences, help each other, and enhance friendship. We sincerely welcome our friends to offer opinions on our various tasks. Let us wish our friends from various countries a pleasant and interesting time in our country!

    祝贺国际民主妇联理事会会议开幕
    国际民主妇联理事会北京会议今天开幕了。出席会议的除各国理事外，还邀请了从世界各地来的著名妇女，特别是亚洲和非洲妇女的代表们。这是国际民主妇联的理事会会议第一次在亚洲国家举行。这个事实的本身，就表现了国际民主妇联对亚非各国妇女的愿望和活动给予了恳切的关怀和支持。毫无疑问，国际民主妇联理事会会议的在北京举行，对于亚非各国妇女是一种鼓舞。我们中国妇女和人民，热烈欢迎这次会议的召开，并衷心地祝贺会议成功！
    世界和平、妇女权利、儿童幸福，是全世界一切妇女和母亲的共同愿望，是同各国人民的根本利益完全一致的。母亲孕育了生命，就更有权利有责任保卫生命。妇女的权利，儿童的幸福，是同人类反对战争，保卫世界和平，反对殖民统治，维护民族独立、自由和繁荣国家经济文化的事业，紧密地联系在一起的。各国妇女在反对战争，反对侵略性军事集团，反对使用原子武器，要求各国裁减军备，要求协商解决国际争端方面，表现了日益高涨的积极性。各国妇女为维护和平而进行的斗争在促进国际局势的和缓方面，起了不可忽视的作用。不能设想，没有妇女参加，人类争取和平和幸福的事业可以取得胜利。
    国际民主妇联从1945年成立以来，就一贯地为保卫和平，保卫妇女权利和儿童幸福的事业而奋斗不懈。并且一贯支持亚洲和非洲妇女保卫民族独立、妇女权利和儿童幸福的事业。不同社会制度国家的妇女、不同种族、不同信仰和不同阶层的妇女，越来越广泛地团结在国际民主妇联的周围。在维护世界和平的斗争中，国际民主妇联积极进行了工作。为了改善妇女儿童的生活和处境，由国际民主妇联主持或倡议召开的四次国际性的大会，不但深受各国妇女会员团体的拥护，并且也取得了许多非会员妇女组织或个人的合作和支持。
    由于苏联和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，目前国际紧张局势已有了进一步的和缓。不同社会制度国家和平共处的原则，已经被许多国家和不同阶层人士接受为国际关系的准则。不同制度的国家之间的经济文化交流，几年来有了显著的发展。殖民主义公开的血腥统治和美国拼凑军事集团的政策，遭到了世界人民特别是亚非各国人民强有力的抨击。大国在裁军问题上立场的逐渐接近，使解决裁军问题出现了现实的前景。在这个形势之下，一切爱好和平的、反映公众要求的国际组织和各国的社会团体，相互建立有效的联系，采取协同一致的行动，高举起反对战争危险、争取国际和平和合作的旗帜，就有力量把世界和平的希望变成现实。在这种形势下召开的国际民主妇联理事会会议，向全世界妇女提出更加有力地行动起来的号召，将会吸引更为广泛的各国妇女组织和各阶层妇女团结合作，为妇女的共同愿望的实现而斗争。在这次会议上，亚非各国妇女的愿望和行动，将得到重视和支持，这是符合当前亚非各国和世界人民为彻底根除可耻的殖民主义而斗争的形势所要求的。亚非各国妇女目前的处境虽然有所不同，但是，由于过去共同的经历和斗争，要求民族独立和和平友好，要求发展本国经济文化，从而改善妇女儿童的生活则是共同的。亚非各国妇女通过这次会议的接触，将增加相互的了解和友谊，进一步发展友好合作。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会已经向前来参加会议的各国理事们发出邀请，在会议后到我国各地访问参观，并同我国各民族、各界妇女和人民会晤，相信必将受到我国妇女和人民的热烈欢迎。我国妇女和人民历来就希望增加同各国妇女和人民之间的相互了解，建立更好的友谊合作关系，并在各种国家工作和妇女活动上交换意见，互相学习有益的经验，互相帮助，增进友谊。我们诚意地欢迎朋友们对我们各项工作提出意见。让我们预祝各国朋友们，在我国期间，过得愉快而饶有兴致！
