    Guangxi Province's more than 5.5 million mu of wheat are being harvested successively. In Rong County, Pingle Prefecture, and the southeastern part of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, the average yield per mu is about 100 to 150 jin, generally higher than last year. The highest yield in Yulin County reached 340 jin per mu, and the lowest was more than 70 jin, with the county's total yield increasing by two times compared to last year.

    In Rong County and Pingle Prefecture, where new wheat has already been put on the market, many agricultural production cooperatives have signed wheat sales contracts with the state grain departments. The new wheat in these two prefectures is enough to feed local farmers for two months.

    广西省小麦登场
    广西省五百五十多万亩小麦陆续登场。容县、平乐专区和桂西僮族自治州东南一带平均每亩收获一百至一百五十斤左右，一般都比去年增产。郁林县最高产量每亩达三百四十斤，最少也有七十多斤，全县比去年增产两倍。
    在新麦已经上市的容县和平乐专区，许多农业生产合作社都和国家粮食部门签定了售麦合同。这两个专区的新麦足够当地农民吃两个月。
