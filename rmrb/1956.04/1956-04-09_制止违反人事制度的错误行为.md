To the Editor:

    Not long ago, the Xuzhou Prefecture Huai River Harnessing Headquarters in Jiangsu Province requested the Construction Section of Xin Hailian City to select fifty trainees for their newly established water conservancy school. The main requirement was a junior high school education level for unemployed workers or young students recommended by the labor department. However, the leaders of the Construction Section did not contact the labor department and randomly recruited trainees everywhere. The family member of a staff member of the cultural center came to the city and met a comrade from the Construction Section on the street and was introduced to participate in the study. Four family members of Construction Section staff who had just come from the countryside were also added to the list. Because the Construction Section did not carefully review the backgrounds of the people recruited, some of those introduced to study included bad elements and even counter-revolutionaries.

    This kind of behavior that violates the personnel organization work system is not uncommon in Xin Hailian City. In particular, the responsible comrades of some agencies often privately arrange jobs for their family members, relatives, or friends. Xu Chenggao, Deputy Chief of the Health Section, introduced his daughter who came from the countryside and the wife of a staff member to work as nurses in the municipal hospital. He expressed dissatisfaction when the Labor Bureau raised objections to this. Chen Xinwen, Minister of the Basic Construction and Transportation Department of the Municipal Party Committee, had the Personnel Section of the Municipal People's Committee Industry Bureau introduce his wife's younger sister to work at the Xin Hai Printing Factory. Tai Zizhen, the Director of the Labor Bureau, himself did not act in accordance with the personnel system. He once privately introduced his son in the countryside to the city to find work without going through organizational procedures.

    This erroneous practice that violates the state's personnel organization work system not only creates opportunities for counter-revolutionaries, potentially causing undue losses to our work, but also leads to a blind influx of rural population into the cities, which is detrimental to agricultural production and the cooperative movement. It is suggested that the Xin Hailian Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conduct an inspection of these matters and take serious action.

### 制止违反人事制度的错误行为

    制止违反人事制度的错误行为编辑同志：
    不久以前，江苏省徐州专署治淮指挥部要求新海连市建设科为他们新近创办的水利学校去选拔五十名学员，条件主要是相当于初中文化程度的失业工人，或者是由劳动部门介绍的青年学生。但是，建设科领导同志不同劳动部门联系，就到处乱拉学员。文化馆一个工作人员的家属到城里来，在街上碰上了建设科的同志，就被介绍去参加学习。建设科有四个工作人员的家属刚从农村来，也都凑上了数。由于建设科对招收的人员的历史没有经过仔细的审查，因此被介绍去学习的人中间，就有一些是坏分子甚至是反革命分子。
    这种违反人事组织工作制度的行为，在新海连市并不是少见的，特别是某些机关的负责同志常常私自为自己的家属、亲戚或朋友安插工作。卫生科副科长徐成高曾把从农村来的女儿和一个科员的爱人介绍到市立医院去做护士，劳动局对他提出意见，他还表示不满意。市委基本建设交通部部长陈心文曾让市人民委员会工业局人事科把自己爱人的妹妹介绍到新海印刷厂去工作。劳动局局长邰子真自己也不按照人事制度办事，他曾经不通过组织手续，私自把自己在农村的儿子介绍到城里来找工作。
    这种违反国家人事组织工作制度的错误做法，不仅给反革命分子造成可乘之隙，可能使我们的工作遭受不应有的损失；而且还使农村人口盲目流入城市，对农业生产和合作化运动也是不利的。建议中共新海连市委会对这些事情进行检查，并作严肃的处理。　雨辰
