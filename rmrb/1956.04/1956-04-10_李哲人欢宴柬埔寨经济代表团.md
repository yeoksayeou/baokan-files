Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: Acting Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China, Li Zheren, held a banquet this evening to welcome the Cambodian Royal Economic Delegation, headed by Huot Sambath, and all members of the delegation.

    In his welcoming speech, Li Zheren said that this visit to China by the Cambodian Royal Economic Delegation will surely pave a broad path for the full development of economic relations between the two countries, based on the foundation of friendly cooperation already laid by the leaders of the two countries. Li Zheren said that there is a very broad prospect for the resumption and development of trade between China and Cambodia. Many of the things needed by the Cambodian market can be supplied by China, and many of the things produced by Cambodia are also needed by China. Li Zheren believes that the current Sino-Cambodian trade talks will achieve good results with the joint efforts of both sides.

    In his speech, delegation leader Huot Sambath said that the people of Cambodia and China have a long-standing close friendship. Although this friendship was interrupted as centuries changed, the desire to restore this friendship has always been in our hearts. Prince Sihanouk is the promoter of the restoration of this friendly relationship. He and Premier Zhou Enlai unanimously agreed that it is necessary to restore and develop the friendly relations between the two countries, especially in the economic and cultural fields. Huot Sambath said that the task of the Cambodian Royal Economic Delegation is to realize the wishes expressed by the leaders of the two countries, that is, to promote the development of economic relations between the two countries.

    Huot Sambath said that the five million people of Cambodia are facing the future with confidence because they are implementing correct policies that are supported by peace-loving people all over the world. This policy is a policy of neutrality and a policy of peaceful coexistence. The Cambodian people are loyal to this policy because it contributes to world peace. At the same time, the Cambodian people have gained a great friend, the Chinese people, because they have steadfastly implemented this policy. Huot Sambath said that the friendship between the people of Cambodia and China will surely continue to develop with the passage of time.

    Attending the banquet this evening were Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Lei Renmin, Director of the Fourth Bureau Yang Haolu, and heads of various bureaus and specialized companies, as well as Deputy Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chen Shuliang.

    This afternoon, delegation leader Huot Sambath led all members of the delegation to visit Acting Minister of Foreign Trade Li Zheren.
