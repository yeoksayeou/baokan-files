Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 15th: The Vietnam News Agency reported on April 15th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced on April 14th a letter from Phạm Văn Đồng, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina issues, dated April 9th. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To the Honorable Chairmen:

In my letter to the two chairmen on February 14, 1956, I already stated that the South's regime's violation of the Geneva Accords has seriously threatened peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

Recently, new developments have occurred.

On April 6th, Saigon Radio broadcast a statement by the Southern regime regarding its attitude towards the withdrawal of French troops from the South.

On April 7th, the International Supervisory and Control Commission forwarded to the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army a letter from Ambassador Aubeino to the International Supervisory and Control Commission, formally notifying the withdrawal of troops and the dissolution of the General Headquarters of the French Federation Forces in Indochina.

In this context, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is honored to present to you, the two chairmen, its views on the responsibility of the French government and the Southern regime to continue implementing the Geneva Accords.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the French government and the Southern regime jointly bear the responsibility for implementing the Geneva Accords under the supervision and control of the International Commission.

Although French troops are withdrawing from South Vietnam, the French government, as a signatory to the Geneva Accords, still bears the responsibility to implement the Geneva Accords and ensure their continued implementation.

During the negotiation and signing of the Geneva Accords, the Southern regime was represented by the French government. From the restoration of peace to the present, the Southern regime has been the administrator of the South, and it has implemented certain provisions of the Geneva Accords together with the French government and enjoyed the benefits brought to it by the Geneva Accords. Thus, in law and in practice, the Southern regime is fully bound by the Geneva Accords, and the argument that the Southern regime is not responsible for the Geneva Accords because it did not sign it is completely unfounded.

Regarding the fundamental issue of the Southern regime's obligations under the Geneva Accords, the Southern regime, in its statement on April 6, still maintains that it "did not sign and did not recognize the Geneva Accords." The arguments put forward by the Southern regime, which refuses to recognize the Geneva Accords, in the aforementioned statement are all one-sided, impractical, and have no legal effect.

The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly demand that the Southern regime assume its responsibility for respecting the Geneva Accords and continuing to fulfill its obligations to strictly implement the Geneva Accords.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently respected and strictly and thoroughly implemented the Geneva Accords.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the issue of a unified Vietnam is the most important issue in continuing to implement the Geneva Accords; only when Vietnam is unified can peace in Vietnam and Indochina be consolidated. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam advocates that the North and South must meet to conduct consultations and reach agreement on measures aimed at achieving the reunification of Vietnam peacefully on the basis of the Geneva Accords.

Regarding the International Supervisory and Control Commission, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the International Supervisory and Control Commission, chaired by the representative of India, has made significant contributions to the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and believes that the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission are necessary in order to supervise and monitor the implementation of the Geneva Accords in accordance with the principle that all parties concerned must ensure the strict and thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to cooperate with the International Supervisory and Control Commission and provide assistance so that it can complete its tasks in the North and South on the basis of the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that in the current serious situation, it is imperative to reconvene the Geneva Conference with the participation of the countries of the International Supervisory and Control Commission to discuss measures to continue implementing the Geneva Accords. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully agrees with and supports the Soviet government's note of March 30th, and hopes that the upcoming talks between the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to discuss the obligations and measures for continuing to fulfill the Geneva Accords will yield good results and lead to the reconvening of the Geneva Conference.

    就法国政府和南越政权继续执行日内瓦协定的责任问题
    范文同写信给日内瓦会议两位主席
    新华社河内15日电　越南通讯社十五日讯：越南民主共和国外交部十四日公布了越南民主共和国总理兼外交部长范文同四月九日给关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席的信。信的全文如下：
    两位主席先生：
    在1956年2月14日给两位主席的信中，我已经说明了由于南方政权破坏日内瓦协定已经使越南以及东南亚的和平受到严重威胁。
    最近情况有了新的变化。
    四月六日，西贡广播电台广播了南方政权发表的对法国军队撤出南方的态度的声明。
    四月七日，国际监督和监察委员会转给越南人民军总司令部一封奥培诺大使寄给国际监督和监察委员会的信，信里正式通知撤退军队和解散在印度支那的法兰西联邦部队总司令部。
    在这种情况下，越南民主共和国政府荣幸地向你们，两位主席先生阐述自己对法国政府和南方政权继续实施日内瓦协定的责任的观点。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，法国政府和南方政权共同负有在国际委员会的监督和监察下实施日内瓦协定的责任。
    虽然法国军队撤出越南南方，作为签订日内瓦协定一方的法国政府仍然负有实施日内瓦协定并保证其得到继续实施的责任。
    在谈判和签订日内瓦协定的过程中，南方政权是由法国政府代表的。从和平恢复到现在，南方政权是南方行政的管理者，它们已经同法国政府一起实施了日内瓦协定的某些条款，享受了日内瓦协定为它们带来的好处。这样，在法理上和实际上，南方政权就完全受日内瓦协定的约束，南方政权借口没有签字因而对日内瓦协定不负有责任的论调是完全没有根据的。
    关于南方政权对日内瓦协定所负的义务这个根本问题，南方政权在四月六日的声明中仍旧认为“没有签字并且也没有承认日内瓦协定”。拒绝承认日内瓦协定的南方政权在上述声明中所提出的论据都是片面的、不切实际的和没有法律效力的。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决要求南方政权承担它对于尊重日内瓦协定和继续履行严格实施日内瓦协定的义务所负的责任。
    越南民主共和国政府这方面始终如一地尊重和严格彻底实施日内瓦协定。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，统一越南的问题是继续实施日内瓦协定中最重要的问题；只有越南得到统一，越南和印度支那的和平才能得到巩固。越南民主共和国政府主张北南两方必须会晤，以便进行协商，并且就目的在于在日内瓦协定的基础上通过和平方式实现越南统一的措施达成协议。
    关于国际监督和监察委员会，越南民主共和国政府认为，以印度代表为主席的国际监督和监察委员会对日内瓦协定的实施已经作出了显著的贡献，并且认为国际监督和监察委员会的活动是必要的，以便根据有关各方必须按照日内瓦协定的规定保证严格和彻底实施日内瓦协定的原则，对实施日内瓦协定进行监督和监察。越南民主共和国政府愿意同国际监督和监察委员会合作，并且予以协助，使它能在日内瓦协定各条款的基础上完成在北方和南方的任务。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，在目前的严重情况下，重新召开有国际监督和监察委员会各国参加的日内瓦会议以商讨继续实施日内瓦协定的措施是非常必要的。越南民主共和国政府完全赞成和支持苏联政府三月三十日的照会，并且希望即将举行的日内瓦会议两位主席讨论继续履行日内瓦协定的义务和措施问题的会谈能带来良好的结果，并且能导向重新召开日内瓦会议。
