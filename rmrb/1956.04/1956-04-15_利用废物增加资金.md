    Using Waste to Increase Funds
    The Aiguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, adopted a new method of collecting scrap copper and iron as investment when raising production funds.
    The cooperative's staff calculated the accounts for the members: if the entire cooperative of more than 1,600 households each contributed an average of ten jin of scrap copper and iron, the entire cooperative would have 16,000 jin. The cooperative already had three red furnaces and ten blacksmiths. As long as more than 7,000 jin of scrap iron were used for self-manufacture, the 650 small farm tools that the cooperative planned to add this year could be completely solved by themselves. The remaining 8,000-plus jin of scrap copper and iron could be used to make small farm tools for the market, and some could be sold to the state. In total, 16,000 jin of scrap copper and iron could play the role of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan of funds.
    When mobilizing members to invest in the cooperative with scrap copper and iron, it is necessary to implement the policy of voluntary mutual benefit. In addition to explaining to the members the benefits of collecting scrap copper and iron as investment, the Aiguo Agricultural Production Cooperative also stipulated specific methods for evaluating scrap copper and iron according to quality as members' investment. As a result, the members sent broken knives, broken hoes... to the cooperative. By March 29, more than 4,000 jin had been collected. The members happily said: Diligence and thrift in running the cooperative finds tricks, and waste can be turned into active funds.

    利用废物增加资金
    山东莒县爱国农业生产合作社在筹集生产资金的时候，采用了搜集破铜碎铁作为投资的新办法。
    社的工作人员向社员们算了个账：如果全社一千六百多户，平均每户拿出十斤破铜碎铁来，全社就有一万六千斤。社里原有三盘红炉，十个打铁工人，只要用七千多斤废铁自打自造，今年社里要添置的六百五十件小农具就完全可以自己解决。剩下八千多斤破铜碎铁，一部分可以用来打些小农具供应市场，一部分可以卖给国家。总计一万六千斤破铜碎铁，能够发挥五、六千元资金的作用。
    动员社员拿破铜碎铁向社里投资，一定要贯彻执行自愿互利政策。爱国农业生产合作社除向社员讲明搜集破铜碎铁作为投资的好处外，还规定了破铜碎铁按质折价作为社员投资的具体办法。社员便把破刀、破锄头……都送到社里来了。到三月二十九日，已经搜集到了四千多斤。社员们高兴地说：勤俭办社找窍门，废物能变活资金。
