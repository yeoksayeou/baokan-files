Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 22nd: U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a speech on American foreign policy issues at the annual banquet of the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 21st.

Evidently with an eye on the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November, Eisenhower began his speech by discussing the changes in the international situation in recent years. He compared the current international situation with the situation three years ago when he took office. He said that today the world has breathed a little easier.

Eisenhower devoted a large part of his speech to the "challenges" the United States faces in winning over the newly independent nations in vast regions of the world and resisting the enormous influence of Soviet peaceful diplomacy. Eisenhower admitted that these independent nations "are easily angered by any disregard for their sovereignty. Some of them want to avoid any entanglement with other countries." He said, "We Americans should understand and respect these views." Eisenhower said that the people of these newly independent countries are eager to industrialize their countries and seek material progress in a shorter period. In this regard, Eisenhower was very concerned about the example provided by the socialist camp countries to these newly independent countries. He advocated that for America's "enlightened self-interest," corresponding actions should be taken to formulate a long-term plan to "aid" backward countries, the purpose of which is to maintain Western "freedom."

Eisenhower then talked about the three "guiding principles" for future American foreign policy. His first principle was to continue to "maintain collective defense" and continue to strengthen the "military strength" of the United States and its allies. At the same time, he also expressed his willingness to continue to seek solutions to the disarmament problem. He said: "War in our time has become an error of the age. No matter what the situation was in the past, future wars will not achieve any useful purpose."

The second "guiding principle" Eisenhower put forward was to make the United States "a helpful and understanding partner" in the "free world." Eisenhower was uneasy about the discord within the Atlantic alliance. Under this principle, the task he proposed for the United States was: to strengthen the ties within the Atlantic alliance, to assist the economies of less developed countries, and to make the exchange of peaceful trade "no longer subject to useless restrictions." He admitted that "weapons alone" cannot bring "reliable security."

Eisenhower's third "guiding principle" was to use so-called peaceful methods to "promote the correction of current injustices by the Soviet bloc." He cited the division of Germany and Korea, and the so-called "subordinate status" of Eastern European countries, as examples, trying to justify America's aggressive stance and policy of interference on these issues by inverting black and white.

Speaking of U.S.-Soviet relations, Eisenhower said: "The interests and objectives of the United States and the free world do not conflict with the legitimate interests of Russia or the aspirations of its people." He also expressed his willingness to establish "friendly relations" with the Soviet Union. However, he still refused to abandon the cliché of "Soviet aggression" and demanded that the United States and the "free world" not relax their "vigilance."

    艾森豪威尔发表外交政策演说
    新华社22日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔四月二十一日在美国报纸编辑协会年会宴会上发表了一篇关于美国外交政策问题的演说。
    显然着眼于今年十一月美国将要举行的总统选举，艾森豪威尔在演说一开头就谈到近年来国际局势的变化。他把当前的国际局势同三年前他上台的时候的局势作了一番对比。他说，今天世界已经稍为松了一口气。
    艾森豪威尔在演说里用很大篇幅谈到美国在争取世界广大地区上的新独立国家和抵抗苏联和平外交政策的巨大影响方面所面临的“挑战”。艾森豪威尔承认，这些独立国家“容易为它们的主权遭到任何藐视而愤怒。它们中间有一些国家要避免同其他国家有任何瓜葛”。他说，“我们美国人应当了解并且尊重这些观点。”艾森豪威尔说，这些新取得独立的国家的人民渴望在较短的时期内使它们的国家工业化和求得物质上的进展。在这方面，艾森豪威尔对社会主义阵营国家为这些新独立国家所提供的榜样非常担心。他主张为了美国的“开明的自我利益”，应当采取相应的行动，制定一个长期的“援助”落后国家计划，这个计划的目的，就在于维护西方的“自由”。
    艾森豪威尔接着谈到美国外交政策今后的三项“指导方针”。他的第一项方针就是继续“保持集体防御”，继续加强美国和它的盟国的“军事力量”。他同时又表示愿意继续寻求解决裁军问题的办法。他说： “我们时代的战争已经成了一种时代的错误。不论以往的情况怎样，今后的战争是达不到任何有用的目的的。”
    艾森豪威尔提出的第二项“指导方针”是要使美国成为“自由世界”的“一个有帮助的和能体谅人的伙伴”。艾森豪威尔对大西洋集团内部的不和感到不安。他在这个方针下为美国提出的任务是：必须加强大西洋集团内部的联系，援助不大发达的国家的经济和使和平贸易的交流“不再受到无益的限制”。他承认“光靠武器”并不能带来“可靠的安全”。
    艾森豪威尔的第三项“指导方针”是要用所谓和平方法来“促使苏联集团纠正现在的不正义现象”，他举出德国和朝鲜的分裂以及所谓东欧国家的“从属地位”为例，力图用颠倒黑白的办法，来替美国在这些问题上的侵略立场和干涉政策作辩护。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到美苏关系时说：“美国和自由世界的利益和目的同俄国的正当利益或是它的人民的愿望并不冲突。”他并且表示愿意同苏联建立“友好关系”。可是他仍旧不肯丢弃“苏联侵略”的滥调，并且要求美国和“自由世界”不能放松“警惕”。
