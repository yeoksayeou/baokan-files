    Xinhua News Agency, April 24th. The spokesperson for the Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation held a press conference in the press room of the CPPCC Auditorium in Beijing on the afternoon of April 24th. The spokesperson briefly introduced the organizational structure of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the development of the international women's movement over the past decade, and the upcoming meeting of the Council. The spokesperson said that the Women's International Democratic Federation currently maintains contact with women's organizations in 76 countries around the world, and it also has contacts with women's organizations and well-known women in 13 other countries.
    The spokesperson said: Since the establishment of the Women's International Democratic Federation in 1945, the international women's movement has made great progress. At that time, representatives from only 40 countries and 80 million women participated in the founding conference. Recently, the scale of the development of women's movements in various countries, especially in Asia, has been astonishing. For example, in Indonesia, its women's organization had only 6,000 members two years ago, but now it has expanded to 500,000. In Japan, the women's movement has become a broad mass movement.
    The spokesperson said that the central issue of this Council meeting is to promote the international women's movement and expand friendly cooperation among women in various countries.

    国际妇联书记处招待记者
    据新华社24日讯  国际民主妇女联合会书记处发言人在四月二十四日下午在北京政协礼堂记者室举行记者招待会。发言人扼要地介绍了国际民主妇联的组织情况、十年来国际妇女运动的发展以及即将开幕的理事会会议的情况。发言人说：在目前，国际民主妇联同世界上七十六个国家的妇女团体建立了联系，它还同其他十三个国家的妇女团体和知名妇女有联系。
    发言人说：自从1945年国际民主妇联成立以来，国际妇女运动已经有了巨大发展。在那个时候，只有四十个国家、八千万妇女的代表参加了成立大会。而近来，各国妇女运动，尤其是亚洲妇女运动的发展规模，已经很惊人了。例如，印度尼西亚，两年前它的妇女组织只有六千个会员，现在已经扩展到五十万人。在日本，妇女运动已变成广泛的群众性运动。
    发言人说，这次理事会会议的中心问题是推进国际妇女运动，扩大各国妇女之间的友好合作。
