Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS—The World Peace Council's special session held plenary meetings on the morning and evening of April 9 to continue discussing disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    Albanian representative Mydal Shtura suggested at the morning meeting that an appeal be made to the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee, calling on representatives of the major powers to reach a disarmament agreement.

    Irish representative Armstrong said that the continuous expansion of armaments would lead to poverty and war. He hoped that the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain would bring good results for the cause of peace.

    Pakistan's representative Zahiruddin called for a struggle to eliminate colonialism. He said that the people of Pakistan, like the people of other countries, urgently demand peace.

    Korean Democratic People's Republic representative Han Xueye pointed out that the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons is one of the most urgent issues facing humanity. Han Xueye said that the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea is constantly expanding its armed forces and clamoring to arm new divisions with "the latest weapons, including atomic weapons." This policy is the root cause of tension in the Asian region. Han Xueye advocated the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, the cessation of South Korea's military expansion, the abolition of the military agreement signed between the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, and the convening of a broad international conference with the participation of relevant countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

    British representative Kenyon called for the establishment of cooperation and contact between scientists and industrial workers to work together against the expansion of armaments.

    Maerti, chairman of the Finnish Peace Defense Committee, said that the issue of disarmament and the cessation of the expansion of armaments is of great significance to the people of the Nordic countries. He hoped that the Soviet Union's transfer of the Porkkala Peninsula naval base could serve as an example for other countries that have military bases on foreign territory.

    Romanian representative Ralea pointed out that sincerity for peace must be demonstrated with facts. He mentioned that Romania has reduced the number of troops and cut military expenditures.

    French representative Canter pointed out the necessity of eliminating distrust and suspicion. He expressed hope that the upcoming visit of the French head of government to Moscow to negotiate with Soviet government officials would have a positive impact on the development of the international situation.

    Brazilian parliamentarian Bayens, who participated in the special session as a guest, said that the peace policies of the Soviet Union and other countries have gained many friends. He said that the new disarmament proposal recently put forward by the Soviet Union should be seen as a sincere effort to maintain peace for the sake of universal progress and effective assistance to underdeveloped countries. The Western countries should trust this plan of the Soviet Union.

    The evening meeting on the 9th was held under the chairmanship of Chen Shutong, representative of the People's Republic of China.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS—The various committees of the World Peace Council's special session continued to meet on the evening of April 7 and the morning and afternoon of April 8. At the afternoon meetings on the 8th, the committees began discussing draft resolutions and proposals, which will be submitted to the plenary session for adoption.

    Although the people who spoke at the committee meetings had different viewpoints, they all expressed a sincere desire to promote the movement for disarmament and further easing of international tensions.

    French representative Mitterrand emphasized at the meeting of the Political Committee that the disarmament issue is the central issue of this special session. He also called for efforts to implement the Geneva Agreement on the Indochina issue and to stop military operations in Algeria. Tunisian representative Ben Milad said that the disarmament issue is related to the issue of colonialism. He said that to solve the Algerian issue, the same methods as those used for Morocco and Tunisia must be adopted. K. Ulsson, head of the Swedish delegation, advocated that small countries pursue a policy of neutrality, and suggested that small countries sign an alliance of neutral countries, which would be guaranteed by the major powers. Other speakers argued that the movement to defend peace must be further expanded. Belgian representative Cavenil expressed the hope that peace defenders from Yugoslavia would participate in the world peace defense movement, and Mitterrand supported his opinion.

    The committee meetings also discussed the issues of developing international economic, social, and cultural exchanges and cooperation, assisting underdeveloped countries, and the use of money freed up by disarmament, and many representatives put forward corresponding proposals in these areas.

    The Organizational Committee mainly discussed methods for carrying out a broad disarmament movement in various countries around the world. Brazilian representative Condor suggested that this movement be carried out according to the specific conditions of each country. French representative Vigne suggested organizing a broad disarmament movement and establishing direct contact with various groups for this purpose. He suggested holding a disarmament week in various countries. Soviet representative Tereshkin agreed with the speeches of the above representatives.

    Those who spoke at the meeting of the Atomic Issues Committee emphasized the importance of prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons and the great significance of implementing international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.
