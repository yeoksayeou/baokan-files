    Chairman, fellow delegates, friends, comrades!
    Today is the day of the inauguration of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. All the people of Tibet and all ethnic groups across the country are celebrating this. As a participant in the negotiations for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and one of the signatories of the Seventeen-Point Agreement, and as a representative of the Central Government, I worked with the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and various monastic and secular officials in Tibet for several years, so I am particularly happy and gratified. Here, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and respect to the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, all monastic and secular officials, and people from all walks of life in Tibet for their achievements in the cause of unity and progress in Tibet.
    In the past few years, the Tibetan region has achieved remarkable accomplishments in enhancing unity between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups and within Tibet, as well as in developing political, economic, and cultural undertakings. This is due to the gradual implementation of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and the earnest implementation of the central government's ethnic and religious policies. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established on the basis of these achievements. All of this has been achieved under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, under the direct leadership of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, and through the joint efforts of all monastic and secular officials and people from all walks of life in Tibet. These achievements would not have been possible without the united cooperation of the Tibetan people's leaders, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and without the strenuous efforts of the Tibetan people.
    The staff members sent to Tibet by the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and the PLA troops stationed in Tibet, have been serving the Tibetan people wholeheartedly for several years. Under arduous conditions, they resolutely implemented the central government's policies and guidelines, helped the Tibetan people with much work, and made significant contributions to the construction of Tibet and the consolidation of national defense. These achievements would not have been possible without the hard work and strenuous efforts of these comrades.
    The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is an extremely important step for the Tibetan people in building their own beautiful and happy lives in the big family of our great motherland. It marks a new stage in the work of the Tibetan region. According to the State Council's decision in March 1955 on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the tasks of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region are very important. In order to complete these major and historically significant tasks, I hope that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee, it will first and foremost pay attention to continuing to tirelessly enhance unity in all aspects. The Tibetan local government, the Panchen Kampus Conference Hall Committee, the Qamdo Regional People's Liberation Committee, major monasteries, various religious sects, the CPC Tibet Working Committee, the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all monastic and secular officials and cadres should take strengthening and consolidating unity as a guideline for their actions. Because only long-term close unity and long-term friendly cooperation are the invincible source of strength for us to build Tibet and build the motherland. I believe that under the guidance of the great ethnic policy of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, as long as we respect each other, help each other, are open and honest, and consult on matters in our common work, this unity can definitely be developed and consolidated day by day.
    Secondly, it is hoped that the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region will take the training of native cadres as its top priority and most important responsibility. This is one of the keys to doing all work well in the Tibetan region, because only when a large number of native cadres in various fields grow up can national regional autonomy and various construction undertakings be fully realized.
    Thirdly, I hope that everyone will continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, love the motherland, actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, heighten vigilance, and strictly guard against the instigation and sabotage of imperialism and hidden enemies. Experience has shown that the more united and progressive we are, and the more achievements we make, the more we are hated by the enemy. They are constantly looking for every opportunity to instigate discord and sabotage us. If we cannot heighten our vigilance and smash their conspiracies at any time, our cause of unity and progress will suffer serious damage.
    Let us further unite more closely under the banner of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Tibetan people's leaders, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the CPC Tibet Working Committee, and strive to further realize a united and unified Tibet Autonomous Region!
    I wish the conference a complete success!

    在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上
    张经武的讲话
    主席、各位代表、朋友们、同志们！
    今天是西藏自治区筹备委员会宣告成立的日子，全西藏人民和全国各族人民都正在为此而欢欣鼓舞。我个人，作为和平解放西藏的谈判参加者和十七条协议的签订者之一，作为中央的代表，曾在西藏同达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和各位僧俗官员共同工作了几年，所以尤其感到欢欣和快慰。在这里，我对达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、各位僧俗官员和全西藏的各阶层人民为西藏的团结和进步事业所作的成就衷心的表示祝贺和敬意。
    在过去几年中，西藏地区由于逐步地实现了和实现着和平解放西藏办法的协议、认真地贯彻中央的民族政策和宗教政策，在增强汉藏民族之间的团结和西藏内部的团结方面以及在发展政治、经济和文化事业等方面，都获得了显著的成就。西藏自治区筹备委员会，就是在这些成就的基础上建立起来的。所有这一切都是在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、中共西藏工委的直接领导下，并且经过全体僧俗官员和全西藏各阶层人民的共同努力才得到的，如果没有西藏人民的领袖达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的团结合作，没有西藏人民的努力奋斗，这些成绩的获得是不可能的。
    中国共产党和中央人民政府派来西藏的工作人员和中国人民解放军驻藏部队，几年来，是忠心耿耿地为藏族人民服务的。他们在艰苦的条件下，坚决地贯彻执行了中央的方针政策，帮助西藏人民作了许多工作，对于建设西藏、巩固国防也作出了重大的贡献。如果没有这些同志们的努力工作、艰苦奋斗，这些成绩的获得也是不可能的。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，是西藏人民在我们伟大祖国大家庭中建设自己美好幸福生活的一个极为重要的步骤，它标志着西藏地区的工作进入了一个新的阶段。根据1955年3月国务院关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定，自治区筹备委员会的任务是很重大的。为了完成这些重大的、具有历史意义的任务，我希望筹备委员会成立之后，在自己的工作中，首先要注意继续不懈地增强各方面的团结。西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会、各大寺、各教派和中共西藏工委、中国人民解放军西藏军区，以及所有僧俗官员和干部都应该以加强团结、巩固团结作为自己行动的指针。因为只有长期的紧密团结和长期的友爱合作，才是我们建设西藏、建设祖国不可战胜的力量源泉。我相信在中国共产党和毛主席的各民族平等团结互助友爱合作的伟大的民族政策指导下，只要我们在共同工作中互相尊重，互相帮助，开诚布公，商量办事，这种团结是一定可以日益发展和日益巩固的。
    其次，希望自治区筹委会把培养本民族干部，作为自己的头等重要的职责，这是在西藏地区作好一切工作的关键之一，因为只有大量的、各方面的本民族干部成长起来了，民族的区域自治和各种建设事业才能完满的实现。
    第三，希望大家继续发扬爱国主义精神、热爱祖国，积极参加祖国社会主义建设事业，提高警惕、严防帝国主义和暗藏的敌人的挑拨和破坏。经验证明，我们愈团结愈进步和我们所取得的每一个成就，都是为敌人所仇视的，他们每时每刻都在找寻一切机会向我们进行挑拨离间和阴谋破坏，如果我们不能提高警惕，随时粉碎他们的阴谋，我们的团结和进步的事业就会遭受到严重的损害。
    让我们更进一步紧密地团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的旗帜下，在西藏人民的领袖达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和中共西藏工委的直接领导下，为进一步实现团结的、统一的西藏自治区而努力前进吧！
    祝大会胜利成功！
