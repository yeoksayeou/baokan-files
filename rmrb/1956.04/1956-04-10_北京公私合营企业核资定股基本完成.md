    Beijing’s public-private jointly owned enterprises have basically completed the work of asset verification and share determination, and are now studying the issue of fixed interest rates for private shares.

    This work was carried out under the unified leadership of the Municipal People's Committee and by district and industry, based on asset inventory and valuation. During the asset verification and share determination process, cadres of various professional companies and industrialists and merchants throughout the city extensively studied policies. The leadership resolutely implemented the Central Committee's spirit of "leniency and thoroughness." When mobilizing industrialists and merchants to clear up creditor's rights and debts, the districts fully leveraged their enthusiasm, adopting methods of self-reporting, clearing, and mutual consultation. The vast majority of industrialists and merchants actively and realistically cleared their debts. The government also appropriately accommodated the repayment of public funds by various enterprises based on actual circumstances. For example, the Eastern Suburb District reduced or exempted over 36,000 yuan in taxes and bank loans and other public funds owed by industry and commerce, accounting for more than 53% of the total public funds owed.

    In this asset verification and share determination work, the industry and commerce associations in each district established debt mediation groups, specializing in mediating and handling creditor's rights and debts between private enterprises and private enterprises, and between individuals and individuals. For debts between the public and private sectors, as well as issues such as public reserve funds and insolvency, relevant departments jointly formed "handling groups" to deal with them. For households that were insolvent, the original enterprises were retained as much as possible, based on the needs of the country and the people and the characteristics of the enterprises, to avoid bankruptcy and debt repayment.

    The "Lianjiapu" (husband-and-wife shops) in commerce and the households in industry that still maintained self-production and self-sales after reorganization were not subject to asset verification and share determination, except for a few Lianjiapu that were planned to be merged.

### 北京公私合营企业核资定股基本完成

    北京公私合营企业核资定股基本完成
    北京市公私合营企业的核资定股工作基本完成，现在正在研究私股定息问题。
    这项工作是在清产估价的基础上，由市人民委员会统一领导，分区按行业进行的。在核资定股工作中，由于各专业公司的工作组干部和全市的工商业者普遍学习了政策，领导上坚决贯彻了中央的“从宽从了”精神，各区在发动工商业者清理债权债务的时候，充分发挥了他们的积极性，采取了自行填报、清理和互相协商的办法，绝大多数工商业者都积极主动和实事求是地清理自己的债务。政府也根据实际情况，对各企业归还公款适当予以照顾。如东郊区减免了工商业拖欠的税款和银行贷款等公款三万六千多元，占全部拖欠公款数的53％以上。
    在这次核资定股工作中，各区工商业联合会组织都成立了债务调解小组，专门调解和处理私营企业和私营企业、私人和私人之间的债权债务问题。对公、私之间的债务以及公积金、产不抵债等问题，由有关部门联合组成“处理小组”处理。对产不抵债户，根据国家和人民的需要以及企业特点，尽量保留了原企业，避免破产抵债。
    商业中的连家铺（夫妻店）和工业中改组以后仍保持自产自销的户中，除了个别准备归并的连家铺以外，都没有进行核资定股。
