Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 20th: Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo reiterated at the parliament meeting this morning that his government strongly opposes nuclear weapons tests and embargo policies.

In response to the debate on government policy, Sastroamidjojo said that the government adheres to its statement issued on April 9 regarding the issue of nuclear weapons testing. The government will use every opportunity to prevent such tests, especially when these test sites are located in places that, according to various estimates, will bring unfortunate consequences to the people of Asia and Africa.

Regarding the hope to lift the embargo against China, Sastroamidjojo said that the government will continue its efforts in this regard. He said: "Especially because the embargo not only violates the principles of peaceful coexistence but also seriously hinders our people's economic construction."

The Prime Minister said: "Indeed, the government has realized that, as far as the United Nations' resolutions on implementing this embargo are concerned, it is, in fact, the economically weak countries, including Indonesia, that are forced to bear the heaviest burden."

The Prime Minister also declared once again that his government does not make itself dependent on foreign aid. He said that engineering plans supported by foreign aid will serve as a supplement to plans that are carried out with our own money and that priority will be given to them according to their importance and urgency.

    沙斯特罗阿米佐约反对核子武器试验和禁运政策
    新华社雅加达20日电  印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约在今天上午的国会会议上再一次表示他的政府强烈反对核子武器试验和禁运政策。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约在辩论政府政策时作答复说，政府坚持它在四月九日发表的关于核子武器试验问题的声明。政府将利用一切机会阻止这种试验的进行，特别是当这些试验地点是在根据各种估计都会给亚非人民带来不幸后果的地点。
    关于希望取消对中国的禁运方面，沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，政府将继续它在这方面的努力。他说：“特别是由于禁运不仅违反和平共处的原则，而且还严重妨碍我国人民的经济建设”。
    总理说：“的确，政府已经体会到，就联合国关于施行这种禁运的决议来说，事实上被迫肩负最沉重的负担的是那些在经济上羸弱的国家，包括印度尼西亚在内。”
    总理还再一次声明，他的政府并没有使自己依赖外国的援助。他说，靠外援来进行的工程计划将作为用我们自己的钱来进行的计划的补充，而且要按照轻重缓急来进行。
