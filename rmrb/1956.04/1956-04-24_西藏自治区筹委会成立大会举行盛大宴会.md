Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 23rd: This afternoon, at the Xue Celinka beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held a grand banquet to celebrate its establishment.

　　The banquet venue was set up in several interconnected, enormous engraved tents. The venue was decorated with colorful flags all around, and many large red palace lanterns hung inside. The participants were all dressed in festive attire. Many people had become acquainted at recent gatherings, and this meeting was especially cordial.

　　At the banquet, the Dalai Lama first rose to speak. He said: "The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is now formally established. It will enable the various constructions in the Tibetan area to develop more rapidly and make the strength of the motherland's peaceful construction even stronger. It embodies the will and aspirations of the Tibetan people for many years. This is a great happy event that the Tibetan people are jubilant about."

　　The Panchen Erdeni then congratulated, saying: "The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region marks that the work in our Tibetan region is about to enter a new stage, which will bring infinite happiness and light to our Tibetan people."

　　Chen Yi, head of the central delegation and Vice Premier of the State Council, extended warm congratulations to the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, all monastic and secular officials and people of Tibet on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country, as well as Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai. Chen Yi said: "The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region represents the unity and progress of Tibet." He hoped that after the establishment of the Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee, this institution would be well utilized to build a new Tibet and make the Tibetan people richer day by day.

　　After Chen Yi's speech, he raised his glass and congratulated in Tibetan, saying: "Tashi Delek" (吉祥如意 - Good Luck). Immediately afterwards, the hall resounded with congratulatory shouts of "Tashi Delek." The band played the ancient melody "Langma," which dates back hundreds of years. This ancient melody is only played when the Dalai Lama holds the enthronement ceremony.

　　The people attending the banquet, accompanied by the beautiful and moving Langma music, frequently raised their glasses to the great unity of the Tibetan people and the people of all nationalities of the motherland, to the health of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and to the health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities of the motherland. Representatives of all nationalities from the central delegation and members of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region went to the tables of Chen Yi, the Dalai Lama, and the Panchen Erdeni to offer toasts and congratulations.

　　Yao Xi Zeren Zhuoma, the Dalai Lama's sister and a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke. She said: "This is the first time in history that we Tibetan women have participated in government work, and I am so excited." She repeatedly raised her glass to the development of Tibetan women's work and to the happiness of Tibetan women and children.

　　Before the banquet began, a light spring rain was falling. As the banquet progressed, the dark clouds in the sky gradually dissipated, and the banquet venue was bathed in brilliant sunshine.

　　Also giving congratulatory speeches at the banquet today were Zhang Jingwu, Apê Awang Jinmei, Zhan Dong Jijinmei, Bangda Duoji, Zhang Guohua, and Wang Feng, among others.

　　Attending the banquet today were all members of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the central delegation, totaling about one thousand people.

    西藏自治区筹委会成立大会举行盛大宴会
    新华社拉萨23日电  今天下午在拉萨布达拉宫下的雪策林卡里，西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会举行了盛大的宴会，欢庆西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立。
    宴会会场设在几个相连的巨大的镌花帐篷里。会场四周插满了各色彩旗，会场里面吊着许多大红宫灯，参加宴会的人都穿着节日的盛装。许多人在最近的几次集会中相识了，这次见面格外的亲热。
    宴会上，达赖喇嘛首先起立讲话。他说：“西藏自治区筹备委员会现在正式宣布成立了。它将使西藏地区的各项建设得到更快的开展，使祖国和平建设的力量更加强大。它体现了西藏人民多少年来的意志和愿望。这是西藏人民欢欣鼓舞的一件大喜事。”
    班禅额尔德尼接着祝贺说：“西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，标志着我们西藏地区的工作将要进入一个新的阶段，它将给我们藏族人民带来无限的幸福和光明。”
    中央代表团团长、国务院副总理陈毅在宴会上代表中共中央、中央人民政府和全国人民以及毛泽东主席、朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理向达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、西藏全体僧俗官员和人民致热烈的祝贺。陈毅说：“西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，表示了西藏的团结和进步。”他希望在自治区筹备委员会成立后，很好地运用这个机构，建设新西藏，使西藏人民一天天富裕起来。
    陈毅讲话后，用藏话举杯祝贺说：“扎西德列”（吉祥如意）。紧接着全场响起了“扎西德列”的祝贺声。乐队奏起了几百年前的古曲——朗玛。这支古曲只有在达赖喇嘛举行坐床典礼的时候才奏的。
    参加宴会的人们，在优美动人的朗玛曲伴奏中，频频举杯为西藏人民和祖国各民族人民的大团结，为达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的健康，为祖国各族人民伟大领袖毛主席的健康干杯。中央代表团各民族的代表和西藏自治区筹备委员会的委员，纷纷到陈毅、达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的席前，敬酒祝贺。
    达赖喇嘛的姐姐、西藏自治区筹备委员会委员尧西·泽仁卓玛讲话。她说：“我们西藏妇女参加政权工作，这在历史上是头一次，我太兴奋了。”她一再举杯为西藏妇女工作的开展，为西藏妇女、儿童的幸福干杯。
    宴会开始前，天空飘着蒙蒙的春雨。随着宴会的进行，天上的乌云逐渐散失，宴会会场上照射着一片灿烂的阳光。
    今天，在宴会上讲话祝贺的还有张经武，阿沛·阿旺晋美，詹东·计晋美，邦达多吉，张国华和汪锋等人。
    今天参加宴会的有西藏自治区筹备委员会和中央代表团的全体人员，共约一千人。
