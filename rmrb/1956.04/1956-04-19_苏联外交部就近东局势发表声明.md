Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 17th (TASS dispatch): Statement by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the Situation in the Near East.

    The current situation that has formed in the Near East is worthy of serious attention from all countries and social circles concerned with consolidating universal peace and further easing international tensions.

    It has been pointed out more than once that the main reason for the deterioration of the international situation in the Middle and Near East is the continued attempts to assemble and expand military blocs in order to achieve colonialist goals and threaten the independence of the peoples of the region and the security of peace-loving countries. The establishment of such blocs has become the source of international friction and disputes in the Middle and Near East, and the cause of the deterioration of relations between Arab countries and Israel and Turkey, as well as between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and Pakistan and India.

    Instead of taking measures to enable the independent countries in this region to establish peaceful and friendly relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence adopted by the Asian-African Bandung Conference, measures are being taken to create opposition between one country and another, which creates tension in the region. The pressure exerted by certain countries on independent Arab countries, attempting to force them to join the aforementioned blocs against their will, such as the well-known Baghdad Pact, violates the principles of the United Nations Organization and is incompatible with the interests of peace and international security.

    The escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the most dangerous factors in the current situation in the Near East. Regardless of how people assess the causes of the conflict, it cannot be ignored that certain groups in some countries that are not concerned with consolidating international peace are trying to use the Arab-Israeli conflict to achieve their own aggressive purposes, even to the point of sending foreign troops into the territories of the countries in the region and creating military disputes. The purpose of interfering in the affairs of Arab countries is to restore colonialism to its position in the Near East, a point of particular interest to certain oil monopolies. It is well known that the 1950 Tripartite Declaration was made with such an attempt in mind. All of this harbors the danger of turning this region into a breeding ground for war, which must never be allowed to happen.

    The Soviet government firmly defends the interests of peace and the peaceful cooperation of all peoples. It resolutely and consistently implements measures to ease international tensions, which is in accordance with the wishes of the people of all countries, including the people of the Near East.

    Since World War II, countries in the Middle and Near East that were recently in a colonial or trusteeship status have achieved national independence and strengthened their national sovereignty. This is a great achievement for the people of the Middle and Near East in the cause of safeguarding peace and security. The Soviet Union expresses sympathy and warm support for the efforts made by Near Eastern countries to strive for and strengthen the independence of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Jordan, Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Israel, and other countries. The Soviet Union also attaches the same importance to the actions taken by Britain and France to promote the solution of pressing issues in the Near East on the basis of recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the above-mentioned countries.

    The principles of respecting national independence and sovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and resolving international disputes by peaceful means are stipulated in the United Nations Charter. The Soviet government, which has consistently upheld these principles, has sincerely and wholeheartedly supported the Arab countries' aspirations to further strengthen their recently gained national independence and to prosper their economies.

    The Soviet Union believes that the consolidation and universal development of the independence of Near Eastern countries is an important guarantee of peace and security in the region. For this reason, the Soviet government is pleased to express its sympathy and support for the desire of the governments of the aforementioned countries to achieve these goals.

    In doing so, the Soviet government is not seeking any special benefits for itself, but only hopes to guide its relations with the countries in this region with the fair principles declared by the Asian and African peoples at the Bandung Conference.

    The Soviet government, hoping to ensure the consolidation of peace and the development of international cooperation on the basis of safeguarding the legitimate national interests of all peoples, has always opposed undermining peace in the Near East and any actions that could lead to armed conflict or be used as an excuse to provoke these conflicts.

    The Soviet government believes that armed conflicts in the Near East can and should be avoided, and that in the interests of all Near Eastern countries, they should not be provoked by others and allow themselves to be drawn into military action.

    At the same time, the Soviet government believes that, from the point of view of safeguarding universal peace, attempts to use the Arab-Israeli conflict to interfere from the outside in the internal affairs of independent Arab countries or to take the opportunity to send foreign troops to the Near East are illegal and intolerable.

    Based on the above, the Soviet government declares:

    1. The Soviet Union will give necessary support to the methods and means of the United Nations to seek to consolidate peace in the Palestine region and to the measures to strive to implement the corresponding resolutions of the Security Council.

    2. The Soviet Union believes that measures should be taken in the near future to strive to ease the existing tensions in the Palestine region without external interference that violates the will of the Near Eastern countries and the principles of the United Nations.

    The Soviet Union calls on the parties concerned to abandon any actions that may create tension on the existing demarcation lines stipulated by the armistice agreements between Arab countries and Israel, and to take necessary measures to improve the difficult situation of hundreds of thousands of homeless and destitute Arab refugees.

    3. The Soviet Union believes that in order to consolidate international peace and security, it is necessary to consider the legitimate national interests of the parties concerned and to achieve a consolidated peaceful settlement of the Palestine issue on a mutually acceptable basis.

    The Soviet government expresses its hope to work with other countries to promote a peaceful resolution of outstanding issues.

### 苏联外交部就近东局势发表声明

    苏联外交部就近东局势发表声明
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：苏联外交部关于近东局势的声明。
    目前在近东地区形成的局势是值得关心巩固普遍和平和进一步缓和国际紧张局势的一切国家和社会各界严重注意的。
    人们曾经不止一次地指出过，中近东国际局势恶化的主要原因是，有人继续不断地企图拼凑和扩大军事集团，以求达到殖民主义的目的，威胁这个地区各国人民的独立以及爱好和平国家的安全。这种集团的建立成了中近东地区的国际摩擦和争端的根源，成了阿拉伯国家同以色列和土耳其的关系恶化以及巴基斯坦同阿富汗、巴基斯坦同印度的关系恶化的原因。
    不采取措施使这个地区的独立国家在亚非国家万隆会议所通过的和平共处原则的基础上建立和平友好的关系，反而采取措施使一个国家同其他国家对立，这就造成这个地区的紧张局势。某些国家对独立的阿拉伯国家施加压力，企图违反这些国家的意志迫使它们加入上述集团，如众所周知的巴格达条约，这种做法是违反联合国组织的原则的，并且是同和平和国际安全的利益不相容的。
    阿拉伯—以色列冲突的尖锐化是目前近东局势中最危险的因素之一。不论人们对冲突的起因估计怎样，却不能不看到，若干国家某些不关心巩固国际和平的集团力图利用阿拉伯—以色列冲突来达到自己的侵略目的，甚至要把外国军队开入这个地区的各国的领土并且造成军事纠纷。对阿拉伯国家事务进行干涉的目的是要恢复殖民主义在近东的地位，某些石油垄断资本对这一点特别感到兴趣。大家知道，1950年的三国宣言就是抱着这样一种企图的。所有这一切孕育着使这个地区成为战争策源地的危险，而这是决不能任它发生的。
    苏联政府坚决捍卫和平以及各国人民和平合作的利益。它坚决一贯地实行着争取缓和国际紧张局势的措施，这一点符合于世界各国人民，包括近东各国人民的愿望。
    一些不久以前还处在殖民地或者托管地地位的国家在第二次世界大战以后获得了民族独立和加强了国家主权，这是中近东各国人民在保障和平和安全的事业中的一个伟大的成就。苏联对近东各国为争取和加强埃及、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、也门、约旦、利比亚、苏丹、伊拉克、以色列等国家的独立所作的努力表示同情和热烈支持。苏联也同样地重视英国和法国所采取的在承认上述国家的独立和主权的基础上促使近东迫切的问题得到解决的行动。
    尊重民族独立和主权、不干涉各国内政、用和平方法解决国际争端的原则都是联合国宪章所规定的。一贯拥护这些原则的苏联政府，过去和现在一直真诚地和全心全意地支持阿拉伯国家争取进一步加强它们不久以前获得的民族独立、争取繁荣它们的经济的愿望。
    苏联认为，近东各国独立的巩固和普遍发展是这个地区的和平和安全的重要保障。正因为如此，苏联政府很乐意地表示同情和支持上述国家政府要求达到这些目的的愿望。
    苏联政府这样做并不是要为自己谋取任何特殊利益，而只希望以亚非人民在万隆会议上所宣布的公正原则来指导自己同这个地区的国家的关系。
    苏联政府希望保证巩固和平和在维护各国人民公正的民族利益的基础上发展国际合作，向来反对破坏近东地区的和平，反对足以引起武装冲突或者足以被利用为挑起这些冲突的口实的任何行动。
    苏联政府认为，可以而且应该避免近东地区的武装冲突，为了所有近东国家的利益，应该不受别人挑拨而让自己被卷入军事行动。
    同时，苏联政府认为，从维护普遍和平的观点看来，利用阿拉伯—以色列的冲突来从外面干涉独立的阿拉伯国家的内部事务或者乘此机会把外国军队开到近东地区来的企图，是非法的，而且是不可容忍的。
    根据上述情况，苏联政府声明：
    一、苏联对于联合国谋求巩固巴勒斯坦地区和平的方法和手段以及争取执行安全理事会的相应决议的措施，给予必要的支持。
    二、苏联认为，应当在最近期间内采取措施，争取在没有违背近东国家的意志和联合国原则的外来干涉的条件下，缓和巴勒斯坦地区的现有紧张局势。
    苏联号召有关方面放弃任何可能在为阿拉伯国家和以色列停战协定所规定的现有分界线上造成紧张局面的行动，并且采取必要的措施，以改善几十万无家可归和无以为生的阿拉伯难民的艰难处境。
    三、苏联认为，为了巩固国际和平和安全，必须要考虑有关方面公正的民族利益，在互相可以接受的基础上使巴勒斯坦问题得到巩固的和平解决。
    苏联政府方面表示希望同其他国家一起来促使悬而未决的问题得到和平解决。
