    Correctly Implement the Reward System for Rationalization Proposals
    To the Editor:
    The Chongqing Second Steel Plant has not correctly implemented the reward policy for rationalization proposals.
    In June of last year, worker Mou Wenxiang proposed rationalization suggestions for fully utilizing air compressors and improving labor organization. After this suggestion was adopted and implemented, the workshop's rationalization proposal review team proposed awarding only five yuan. The workshop's trade union believed that, according to state regulations, the reward should be forty-eight and a half yuan, and raised a dissenting opinion. Deputy Director Yang Guang did not properly study both sides' opinions and arbitrarily instructed: "No specific measures, reward twenty yuan." In fact, Mou Wenxiang's suggestion did have specific measures. Therefore, the factory's rationalization proposal review committee and the trade union repeatedly raised their opinions. It wasn't until December that Deputy Director Yang agreed to issue the award according to government regulations.
    Another example is the rationalization proposal made by factory trainee Mao Guoyao regarding saving cattle hair felt. After its adoption and implementation, the effect was good. According to regulations, he should have been rewarded thirty-six yuan; however, Deputy Director Yang, using the reason that "the amount of the bonus should depend on the recipient's salary," only awarded him fifteen yuan.
    Furthermore, in September of last year, staff member Zeng Zhixiang proposed a rationalization suggestion to use steel plate scraps instead of good steel plates: Previously, the machine repair workshop used whole pieces of good steel plate, priced at one and a half yuan per kilogram, while steel plate scraps only cost eighteen cents per kilogram. According to preliminary calculations, this suggestion could save the factory more than 60,000 yuan annually. However, Deputy Director Yang said: "Who doesn't know about using steel plate scraps? You want money for just mentioning it!" In the end, he decided to award a bonus of twenty yuan. The cadres of the rationalization proposal review committee dared not tell the workshop about this decision, so Deputy Director Yang said: "Then just shelve it there." Thus, Zeng Zhixiang's rationalization proposal, although already adopted and implemented, has not yet been rewarded.
    Failure to give due rewards for employees' rationalization proposals will suppress the creativity of the masses. The Chongqing Second Steel Plant's erroneous practices must be corrected immediately.

### 正确执行对合理化建议的奖励制度

    正确执行对合理化建议的奖励制度编辑同志：
    重庆第二钢铁厂没有正确地执行对合理化建议的奖励政策。
    去年六月间，工人牟文祥提出了充分利用空气压缩机和改进劳动组织的合理化建议。这项建议被采纳执行以后，车间合理化建议审查组竟提出只发五元钱的奖励金。车间工会认为根据国家规定计算，应该奖励四十八元半，就提出不同意见。副厂长杨光没有很好地研究两方面的意见，就随便批示：“无具体措施，奖励二十元。”事实上，牟文祥的建议中是有具体措施的。因此，厂合理化建议审查委员会和工会又一再提出意见。直到十二月，杨副厂长才同意按照政府规定发奖。
    又如，工厂练习生毛国尧提出的节约牛毛毡的合理化建议，采纳执行以后效果良好。按照规定，应该奖励三十六元；但是杨副厂长却用“发奖金要看受奖人的工资多少”为理由，只奖给了十五元。
    再如，去年九月，职员曾致祥提出了利用钢板边代替好钢板的合理化建议：以前机修车间用的都是整块的好钢板，每公斤价格一元半，而钢板边每公斤只要一角八分，据初步计算，这项建议每年可以使厂里节约六万多元。可是，杨副厂长却说：“用钢板边哪个不晓得，提个意见还要奖钱呀！”最后，他决定发给奖金二十元。合理化建议审查委员会的干部不敢把这个决定告诉车间，杨副厂长就说：“那末就搁到那里吧。”就这样，曾致祥的合理化建议虽然已经采纳执行了，但是至今还没有给予奖励。
    对职工的合理化建议不给以应有的奖励，就会压抑职工群众的创造性。重庆第二钢铁厂这种错误做法，必须立即纠正。
