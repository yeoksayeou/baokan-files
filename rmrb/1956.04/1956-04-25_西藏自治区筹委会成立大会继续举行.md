Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 24th. The inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region continued in the Lhasa Auditorium today, the third day since the committee was declared established. Both the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni delivered reports at the meeting (see pages 2 and 3). They were beaming as they spoke, and their reports were frequently interrupted by prolonged applause from the audience.

At today's meeting, representatives from various ethnic groups within the Central Delegation, Wang Zaitian (Mongolian), Sangji Yexi (Tibetan), Saifulaev (Uyghur), Wu Hongbin (Hui), Guojimugu (Yi), Ou Baichuan (Miao), Zhu Dehai (Korean), and Meng Suifen (Bouyei, female), all extended congratulations to the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Their congratulatory speeches elicited enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Wang Zaitian said: The people of all ethnic groups in Tibet and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are hardworking, brave, and freedom-loving outstanding nationalities. Historically, they have contributed to the political, economic, and cultural development of the motherland. However, due to long-term enslavement by imperialism and exploitation and oppression by reactionary ruling classes, our ethnic groups were in a state of poverty and backwardness. But this painful history is long gone. The great ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao has not only liberated our ethnic groups but has also opened up broad avenues for the unity, cooperation, and common development of our ethnic groups. Wang Zaitian said: We firmly believe that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, it will powerfully promote the realization of regional autonomy and, with the continued assistance of the Han nationality, achieve even greater success in various tasks.

Sangji Yexi said in his congratulatory speech that facing the brilliant achievements of Tibet in the past five years and looking forward to the beautiful future of building a new Tibet, as a Tibetan, my heart is particularly filled with joy and hope. I congratulate the victorious establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and I sincerely hope that a new Tibet will grow, develop, and become strong in the big family of the motherland.

In his congratulatory message, Saifulaev introduced in detail the happy life and construction achievements of the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. He said: The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the people of Tibet have historically shared weal and woe, helped each other, and had a relationship of mutual assistance. The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region express warm congratulations on the great event in the political life of the Tibetan people—the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region—for our friends and neighbors with whom we have had a long-standing historical relationship, and celebrate this festival together with the Tibetan people.

The meeting adjourned at 4:45 PM and will continue tomorrow.

    西藏自治区筹委会成立大会继续举行
    新华社拉萨24日电  今天是西藏自治区筹备委员会宣告成立后的第三天，西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会继续在拉萨大礼堂举行。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在大会上都作了报告 （见第二版和第三版）。他们作报告的时候满面笑容，报告时常为会场上经久不息的掌声所打断。
    在今天的大会上，中央代表团各兄弟民族的代表王再天（蒙古）、桑吉悦希（藏）、赛夫拉也夫（维吾尔）、吴鸿宾（回）、果基木古（彝）、欧百川（苗）、朱德海（朝鲜）、蒙素芬（布依、女），都向西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会表示祝贺。他们的祝词不断引起会场上热烈的掌声。
    王再天说：西藏和内蒙古自治区各族人民都是勤劳勇敢和爱好自由的优秀民族，在历史上对祖国政治、经济、文化的发展是有贡献的，由于过去长期遭受帝国主义的奴役和反动统治阶级的剥削、压迫，使我们各族人民处于贫困落后的境地。但是，这段沉痛的历史早已是一去不复返了，中国共产党和毛主席的伟大的民族政策不仅解放了我们各族人民，而且为我们各族人民的团结合作共同发展开辟了广阔的道路。王再天说：我们深信，西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后，它将有力地推动区域自治的实现，并且在汉民族的继续帮助下，在各项工作中获得更多更大的成绩。
    桑吉悦希在祝词中说，面对着西藏地方五年来的光辉成就，瞻望着建设新西藏的美好前途，我是一个藏族，内心特别充满了愉快和希望。我祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会的胜利成立，我衷心地盼望一个新西藏在祖国大家庭中成长、发展和壮大起来。
    赛夫拉也夫在贺词里详细地介绍了新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民的幸福生活和建设成就。他说：新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民和西藏人民在历史上曾经有过共患难、同甘苦、互相帮助的关系。新疆维吾尔自治区的各族人民对于自己的有着悠久历史关系的朋友和近邻西藏人民政治生活中的大喜事——成立西藏自治区筹备委员会，表示热烈的祝贺，并且和西藏人民一起来欢度这个节日。
    大会在下午四时三刻休会，明天将继续举行。
