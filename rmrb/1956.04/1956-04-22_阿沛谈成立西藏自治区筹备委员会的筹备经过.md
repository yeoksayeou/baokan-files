Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 21st: The inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will be held in Lhasa on the 22nd. Apa A Wang Jinmei, Director of the Preparatory Office for the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, delivered a radio address in Lhasa yesterday, stating that the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region fully conforms to the interests of the Tibetan people and lays the foundation for the prosperity and happiness of Tibet.

In his speech, Apa A Wang Jinmei detailed the preparatory process for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. He said: During the period when the Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini went to Beijing in 1954 to attend the First Session of the First National People's Congress, they were received by Chairman Mao and given cordial instructions. The Tibetan local government, the Bainqen Kanpo Lija Committee, and the Changdu Area People's Liberation Committee held discussions and, on the basis of voluntary agreement, jointly petitioned the State Council to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. This petition was discussed and approved at the Seventh Plenary Session of the State Council. Subsequently, under the direct leadership of Dalai Lama, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, Bainqen Erdini, First Vice Chairman, and Zhang Guohua, Second Vice Chairman, all parties took the initiative to assign staff to participate in the work of the Preparatory Office for the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Han cadres sent by the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China to assist in the work and Tibetan cadres assigned by all parties in Tibet gathered together, respecting, learning from, and helping each other. This atmosphere of close unity was unprecedented. They were very active in both work and study. At the same time, all parties were concerned about and provided great assistance to the work of the Preparatory Office, so the work of the Preparatory Office was successfully completed. The staff of the Preparatory Office also took time to study documents such as the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which improved their policy level to a certain extent. He also emphasized in his speech that the rumors fabricated by imperialism have been completely bankrupt among the Tibetan people, the unbreakable unity of the Tibetan and Han nationalities is increasingly consolidated, and the internal disunity created by the former domestic reactionary ruling class and imperialism among the Tibetan people has been completely eliminated, and close unity among the Tibetan people has been achieved.

    阿沛谈成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的筹备经过
    新华社拉萨21日电  西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会将在二十二日在拉萨举行，西藏自治区筹备委员会筹备处处长阿沛·阿旺晋美，昨天在拉萨市有线广播中发表了广播讲话，他说：西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，完全符合西藏民族的利益，为西藏的繁荣和幸福奠定了基础。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美这篇讲话中，详细叙述了成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的筹备经过。他说：达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼1954年去北京出席第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议期间，得到了毛主席的接见和亲切指示。西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会和昌都地区人民解放委员会各方面进行了商讨，在自愿一致的基础上，共同呈请国务院成立西藏自治区筹备委员会。这个呈请在国务院全体会议第七次会议上讨论后批准了。此后，在西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员达赖喇嘛、第一副主任委员班禅额尔德尼和第二副主任委员张国华的直接领导下，各方面都主动指派工作人员参加西藏自治区筹备委员会筹备处的工作。中共西藏工作委员会指派来帮助工作的汉族干部和西藏各方面指派来的藏族干部会聚一堂，互相尊重，互相学习，互相帮助，这种亲密团结的气氛是从来不曾有过的。他们无论在工作和学习方面，都很积极。同时，各方面对筹备处的工作都很关心，并给予了很大帮助，因此筹备处的工作得以圆满完成。筹备处的工作人员还抽时间学习了中华人民共和国宪法等文件，在一定程度上提高了政策水平。他在讲话中还强调指出：帝国主义制造的谣言在西藏人民中间已经彻底破产，藏、汉民族牢不可破的团结日益巩固，以往国内反动统治阶级和帝国主义在西藏人民内部制造分裂，使西藏内部互不团结的情况都已完全消除，并已达成了西藏人民内部的亲密团结。
