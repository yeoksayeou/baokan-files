Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 23rd: Recently, many relatives of students studying in the United States residing in Guangdong have requested government assistance to help their loved ones return to the motherland and reunite with their families as soon as possible.

    Qu Lili Chun, who works at the Democratic League District Branch in Panyu County, wrote to the Guangdong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, saying that his brother, Qu Liteng, went to the United States to study in July 1949 and has been unable to return home for several years. He does not know his situation and hopes the government will help investigate his whereabouts and assist him in returning to China. He said: "Before leaving the country, my brother was originally a Master of Engineering. The Third Highway Bureau of the Kuomintang Ministry of Communications once appointed him as a consultant, but he refused. He borrowed travel expenses from friends to go to the United States to work and study. When he left, he said that he might obtain a doctorate within eight months or a year and then return to China, so he left behind his wife and two young daughters. Now, it has been many years since we knew his whereabouts." Qu Lichun requested that the responsible U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service tell him the whereabouts of his brother, Qu Liteng.

    Zhu Fuxi, Associate Professor and Deputy Head of the Department of Civil Engineering at the South China Institute of Technology, wrote that his sister, Zhu Weizheng, went to the graduate school of the University of Washington in 1948 to study bacteriology. Later, she transferred to the graduate schools of Stanford University and Ohio University to continue studying bacteriology and work as a researcher, and obtained a master's degree. His sister's husband, Huang Zhuoshao, also studied bacteriology and studied at Stanford, Ohio, Indiana, and Harvard universities to pursue a doctorate. Zhu Weizheng's letter to Zhu Fuxi's niece, Zhou Yimiao, on March 21st of this year was full of hope for returning to China. Her letter read: "Your letter mentioned the joy in the motherland and at home, which makes me envious, but we are now like birds in a cage, with no way out. Only when the Chinese government achieves diplomatic victory will there be hope for returning home." Zhu Fuxi's letter requested the government to assist his sister in returning so that their siblings and their seventy-year-old mother, who is bedridden and longs for her daughter every day, could reunite with their children as soon as possible. Wu Yao, an old lady of seventy-two years old living on Haiwei Street in Guangzhou, wrote that her grandson Zhao Xijun, who is studying in the United States, had repeatedly written letters expressing his willingness to return to China. In a letter written to his sister Zhao Yuxiu on October 11, 1953, Zhao Xijun said: "Brother has many difficulties. One day you will understand why I have not said a word to you all year round." The letter of February 28, 1954, said: "There are many things I cannot tell you in the letter. When I can leave American soil one day, I will tell you." It also said: "Brother was wrong to come to America, but now he is not allowed to leave America unless he can find a way to steal away." The last letter of September 28, 1954, said: "Sister, you hope I will return, but the American government does not allow me to leave the country." Since then, Zhao Xijun has not written any more letters. Wu Yao said: "I miss him anxiously all the time, and I hope he will return to the motherland as soon as possible." Liao Fengling, who lives on Fengning Road, wrote to the Guangzhou Civil Affairs Bureau, saying that her brother, Liao Chongguo, is an ophthalmologist and used to be a lecturer at the University of Chicago. He and his lover, Lu Minzhang, have written letters expressing their willingness to return home together as soon as possible. Last spring, Liao Chongguo wrote to his father-in-law, Lu Zhiwen, in his last letter: "There is no future here. However, because I am listed in the category of 'technical students' and am not allowed to leave the country, I do not know when I can return home to serve the motherland's medical cause, which is extremely depressing." Liao Fengling and Lu Zhiwen and others all expressed their hope that the government would assist their relatives in returning home as soon as possible.

    在广东的留美学生家属要求政府帮助他们
    向美国政府要回亲人
    新华社广州23日电  最近有许多居住在广东的留美学生家属要求政府帮助他们的亲人早日返回祖国与家人团聚。
    在番禺县民主同盟区分部工作的区里纯写给广东省民政厅的信上说，他的哥哥区里腾在1949年7月就到美国留学，几年来一直未能回国，也不知道他的情形，希望政府帮助调查他的下落和协助回国。他说：“我的哥哥在未离国前原是工程硕士，国民党交通部第三公路局曾委任他当顾问，但他拒绝了。他向朋友借旅费去美国半工半读，临去的时候，曾经说可能在八个月或一年内取得博士学位后归国，所以留下了妻子和两个幼女。到现在，已经有好几年不知道他的下落。”区里纯要求负有责任的美国联邦调查局和移民和归化局把他的哥哥区里腾的下落告诉他。
    华南工学院土木系副教授兼副系主任朱福熙来信说，他妹妹朱维正在1948年去华盛顿大学研究院研究细菌学，后来转到史坦福大学、俄亥俄大学研究院继续研究细菌学和担任研究员，并取得了硕士学位。他妹妹的丈夫黄卓韶也是研究细菌学的，曾先后在史坦福、俄亥俄、印地安纳和哈佛等大学学习，攻读博士学位。朱维正在今年三月二十一日给朱福熙的外甥女周宜妙的信中充满希望回国的心情，她的来信这样写着：“你来信说到在祖国和在家内的愉快真使我羡慕，但我们现如笼中之鸟，没有办法，只有待中国政府外交胜利，回国才有希望。”朱福熙的信中要求政府协助他妹妹回来，让他们兄妹及卧病床上终日渴望女儿的七十多岁的母亲能够和儿女早日团聚。住在广州海味街七十二岁的吴姚老大娘来信说，她的留学美国的外孙赵锡均曾经多次写信回来表示愿意回国。1953年10月11日赵锡均写给他的妹妹赵毓秀的信说：“哥哥有很多苦处。将来有一天你会明白我为什么整年没有对你说过一句话的原因”。1954年2月28日的信说：“有许多事，我在信上不能对你说，当有一天能够离开美国国土，我当告诉你。”又说：“哥哥错了，来到美国，但现在不许离开美国，除非有办法偷走才行。”1954年9月28日最后的一封信说：“妹妹，你希望我回来，但美国政府不许我出境”。从这以后赵锡均就没有来信了。吴姚老大娘说：“我时刻都焦急地想念着他，我很希望他早日回到祖国来”。住在丰宁路的廖奉灵写给广州市民政局的信说，她的弟弟廖崇国是学眼科的，曾任芝加哥大学的讲师，他和他的爱人卢敏章来信都表示愿意一同早日返国。去年春天，廖崇国写给他岳父卢稚文的最后一封信中说：“在此事业无前途，惟因被列于‘技术学生’范围之内，不许出境，故不知何日始可归家，为祖国医学效力，苦闷之至”。廖奉灵和卢稚文等都表示希望政府协助他们的亲人早日回国。
