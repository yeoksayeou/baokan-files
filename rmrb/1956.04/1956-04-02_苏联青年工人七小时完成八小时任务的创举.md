    Moscow Dispatch from our newspaper, April 1st. The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are like the rising sun, bringing more and more warmth to the Soviet people. The pre-holiday six-hour workday and the soon-to-be-implemented seven-hour workday have made Soviet workers feel that life is even better and that the socialist system is infinitely superior. In this mood, while studying the Party's resolutions, young workers at the "Proletarian Labor" factory, the Presnya Machine Building Plant, and the Three Hills Textile Factory in Moscow launched an initiative to complete eight hours of work in seven hours.

    Knyazev, a member of the Communist Youth League in the screw workshop of the "Proletarian Labor" factory, manages four machines. He analyzed the work situation of his team in recent months and knew that if machine downtime could be eliminated and work could be balanced, then the eight-hour task could be completed in seven hours. Fellow workshop members Shyrshakov, Burlachenko, and Afonin also calculated that it was possible to complete a shift's task in seven hours. The four of them decided to make rational use of every minute of working time. To this end, they would carefully check the machines before going to work, prepare tools and necessary spare materials; and they decided to study and adopt the most economical and reasonable operating methods.

    Four youth production teams led by Communist Youth League members Shamokhov, Korolev, Mikhailovich, and Dzurichev at the Presnya Machine Building Plant, put forward the same goal. Shamokhov said: "The Party and the government care about shortening our working day, and our reward is: to complete eight hours of work in seven hours."

    Loving their Communist Party, the workers began to work without relaxing every minute of their working time, carefully taking care of equipment, improving their production skills, and striving to complete a shift's task in seven hours every day.

    In less than two weeks, workers in many factories and construction sites in Moscow have risen to respond to this initiative.

    苏联青年工人七小时完成八小时任务的创举
    本报莫斯科1日专电　苏共第二十次代表大会的决议好像东升的太阳，带给苏联人民越来越多的温暖。假日前的六小时工作日和快要实行的七小时工作日使苏联劳动者感到生活的更加美好和社会主义制度的无限的优越。在这样的心情下，在研究党的决议的时候，在莫斯科“无产阶级的劳动”工厂、普列斯尼机器制造厂和三山纺织厂青年工人当中出现了七小时内完成八小时任务的创举。
      “无产阶级的劳动”工厂螺旋车间团员克尼亚则夫管着四台机器。他分析了最近几个月来自己班内的工作情况，知道要是消灭机器停顿现象，做到工作均衡，那么八小时任务可以在七小时内完成。同车间团员什尔沙科夫、布尔拉钦科、阿方林也计算出可能在七小时内完成一班任务。他们四个人决定了合理地利用每一分钟工作时间。为此，在上班前要仔细检查好机器，准备好工具和必要的后备材料；并且决定了研究和采用那些最经济和合理的操作方法。
    普列斯尼机器制造厂由沙莫何瓦洛夫、柯罗列夫、米海洛维奇、久里切夫带领的四个青年团员青年生产组，提出了同样的目标。沙莫何瓦洛夫说：“党和政府关心缩短我们的工作日，我们的报答是：七小时内完成八小时任务。”
    热爱自己的共产党的工人们这样开始了不放松每分钟工作时间，细心照料设备，提高生产熟练水平，争取每日在七小时内完成一班任务。
    不到两星期，莫斯科已有许多工厂和工地的工人们起来响应这个创举。
