Bao Yushan and the Livestock of the Agricultural Production Cooperative
By our reporter Lin Mo

The Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gongcun Village, Fourth District, Zhalute Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, raises several thousand head of livestock, all of which are well-fed and plump, with shiny coats. People from distant villages come to buy good cattle and horses to take back as breeding stock. People nearby are willing to combine their livestock into their herds for grazing.

Before liberation, this village was called Wangjia Wopu (Wang Family Shack).

At that time, Wangjia Wopu was notorious. Landlords Du Sanhu, Wang Guoqing, and others built blockhouses around the village. They colluded with bandits, gambling and smoking opium at night, and robbing people during the day. People said: Wangjia Wopu is the gate of hell, travelers suffer, even geese get plucked!

Back then, there were things like "Cheng Family Company," "Feng Family Distillery," and "Wangjia Wopu" in this area. These were all facilities and brands used by Han Chinese reactionary rulers and feudal landlords to plunder the Mongolian people. Large landlords bought wasteland from Mongolian princes and opened reclamation companies; secondary landlords set up shacks and hired laborers to cultivate the land. They also used the grain they harvested to make liquor, which they sold at high prices, swindling the Mongolian people out of their cattle and sheep.

The Mongolian people's good pastures were seized and reclaimed! How could they live without pastures? Some gathered to resist, but fell in the gunfire of the suppressors. Some drove their livestock, full of hatred, away from their land.

After liberation, the oppressed Mongolian and Han people united under the leadership of the Communist Party to fight the landlords and carry out land reform. At that time, a joint Mongolian-Han Peasants' Association was established here. The directors of the association were Wang Guozhi (Han Chinese), a hired farmhand from Wangjia Wopu, and Bao Yushan (Mongolian), a herdsman from Maotouying.

After the Mongolian-Han Peasants' Association led everyone to overthrow the landlords, it led the two ethnic groups in mutual aid production. Han Chinese farmers lacked livestock for farming, so Bao Yushan mobilized the Mongolian people to support them. The Mongolian people lacked food, seeds, and farm tools, so Wang Guozhi mobilized the Han Chinese people to help. The two of them gradually became close friends.

When mutual aid teams were organized in the village, they were still very poor, with three broken carts, only two of which were usable. However, after the peasants were emancipated, they had great enthusiasm for production and their hearts were united. In less than two years, Wangjia Wopu became a model village for advanced production. The villagers were unwilling to bear the bad reputation left by the landlords, so they changed "Wangjia Wopu" to "Gongcun" (Workers' Village).

As Gongcun's production developed, the village added a lot of livestock. They were models in agricultural production, but they had no experience in managing animal husbandry. It so happened that Bao Yushan was willing to come to Gongcun to graze livestock. The people of Gongcun sent ten large carts to welcome him. Bao Yushan brought his family, young and old, and drove his cattle and sheep, settling down in Gongcun.

Bao Yushan came to Gongcun to graze livestock just when spring was a lean season between harvests. The livestock couldn't get good grass grazing during the day, and there were no sheds at night when they returned to their respective homes; the owners didn't even feed the old and weak livestock extra fodder. Out of the village's sixty-odd cattle, more than twenty were so thin they couldn't stand up, and had to be carried every day. Seeing the livestock freezing and starving like this, he ran to Wang Guozhi to make a suggestion: "Now that we people have been liberated, the livestock are still suffering! Cattle and sheep can't speak, but we can't abuse them like this!" Wang Guozhi helped him mobilize each household to build sheds for the livestock and feed them extra fodder. Many people lacked cattle fodder, so Bao Yushan went to each household's pile of firewood and picked out some soft weeds to feed the cattle. In less than a month, he had revived those half-dead cattle.

Although the livestock in Gongcun were herded together, they were still privately owned by each household. Their livestock used to graze around the village, but there were no good pastures by the village. Bao Yushan proposed to find good pastures far away and graze them in the fields, but many people disagreed. Regardless of whether the livestock were thin or not, they insisted on keeping them in sight every day to feel at ease. "Do you want fat cattle and strong horses? Then listen to me: people look at food, horses look at grass; if you don't find good pastures for grazing, it's like not fertilizing the fields…" Bao Yushan said to everyone he met, and Wang Guozhi also held meetings in the village to mobilize people, slowly persuading everyone.

Bao Yushan drove all the village's livestock to a pasture more than ten miles outside the village. He built houses for people to live in and dug water springs for the livestock to drink. He became the leader of Gongcun's animal husbandry team, leading two young team members. Bao Yushan took them grazing during the day and taught them to read at night. The three of them also made a patriotic pact. Bao Yushan often said: "Grazing requires not only skills, but also putting your heart into the livestock day and night. Carelessness in one thing will cause problems."

In the past, Gongcun didn't separate sheep into groups, mixing rams and ewes together to graze, letting them mate at will and lamb randomly. As a result, many lambs were born, but many also died, and the ewes' health was affected. Bao Yushan proposed to separate rams and ewes for grazing, implement regular mating, and concentrate lambing in the spring. In this way, both large and small lambs would be healthy; lambs would be easier for dedicated personnel to raise and care for, and more would survive. Many people didn't believe in this method. Bao Yushan discussed it with Wang Guozhi and decided to separate their two families' sheep first to show everyone what it was like. After they did this for a year, everyone could see the difference: due to regular mating, Bao Yushan's seventy ewes had eighty-three lambs (thirteen ewes had twins), with a survival rate of 98%; Bian Guojun's sheep were grazed together in mixed groups, mating randomly, and his sixty ewes had fifty-two lambs, with a survival rate of less than 50%. The following year, most of the sheep in the village were grazed separately.

Bao Yushan has rich grazing experience and understands the habits of various livestock. He can change the grazing methods at any time according to the different seasons, the quality of water and grass, and changes in climate and wind direction; he pays great attention to the time of day livestock leave the herd, how quickly they eat grass, and how much water they drink. Some people asked him to talk about his grazing experience, and he would sit down and talk for half a day. He can confidently predict how much meat a sheep can gain in a year. When weighing them at the end, it's only more, never less. Based on his decades of grazing experience, Bao Yushan can promptly find lessons from past accidents. Once, it was discovered that some ewes were aborting. After he and the shepherds studied the situation, they immediately found the cause of the abortions: they had been leaving the herd late and returning early for two days; the road was long, and they were rushing the sheep. The sheep got hot running, drank cold water in the river ditches on the way back, and then lay down in the pen, unable to dissipate the cold, and the pregnant ewes couldn't withstand it.

When Bao Yushan came to Gongcun in 1950, the village had just over two hundred head of livestock. Now the village has four hundred and three cattle, one hundred and seventy horses, and more than one thousand eight hundred sheep. In six years, the village's livestock has increased elevenfold.

Now, Gongcun has established an advanced agricultural production cooperative, and all the villagers' livestock have joined the cooperative. The cooperative has thirteen people grazing livestock. Bao Yushan has become the technical advisor for animal husbandry.

    包玉山和农业生产合作社的畜群
    本报记者　林沫
    内蒙古自治区扎鲁特旗四区工农村胜利农业生产合作社养有几千头牲畜，都养得膘满肉肥，毛色发亮。远乡的人跑来，买上好牛、好马，回去当种畜。近处的人，都愿意把自己的牲畜合到他们的畜群里去放牧。
    这个村子在解放前叫王家窝铺。
    那时候，王家窝铺实在坏得出了名。地主杜三虎、王国清等在村边修了炮楼。他们同土匪扭在一起，夜里聚赌、抽大烟，白天挡道抢人。人们说：王家窝铺是鬼门关，行人受害，雁过拔毛！
    那时候，这一带有什么“程家公司”“冯家烧锅”“王家窝铺”。这些都是汉族的反动统治者、封建地主用以掠夺蒙古族人民的设施牌号。大地主从蒙古王爷手里买下荒地，开设垦殖公司；二地主扎下窝铺，雇工种地。他们又把打下的粮食作烧酒，高价卖出，骗取蒙古族人民的牛羊。
    蒙古族人民的良好牧场，被霸占、被开垦了！他们没有牧场怎能生活呢？有的人聚众反抗，却在镇压者的炮火中倒下了。有的人赶着牲畜，怀着仇恨，离开了自己的土地。
    解放了，受压迫的蒙古族和汉族人民，在共产党领导下团结起来，一起斗争地主，实行土地改革。当时，这地方曾经成立了蒙汉农民联合会。联合会的主任，一个是王家窝铺的雇农王国治（汉族），一个是毛头营的牧民包玉山（蒙古族）。
    蒙汉农民联合会领导大家打倒地主以后，又领导两族人民互助生产。汉族农民种地缺牲畜，包玉山就动员蒙古族人民来支援。蒙古族人民缺少食粮、籽种和农具，王国治就动员汉族人民来帮助。他们两人渐渐成了亲密的朋友。
    村里组织互助组的时候，还是很穷的，三辆破车，只有两辆能使。但是，农民翻身以后生产劲头大，人心齐，不两年，王家窝铺就成了生产先进的模范村。村里人不愿再背地主给留下的坏名声，就把“王家窝铺”改称“工农村”。
    工农村的生产发展了，村里添了不少牲畜。他们在农业生产上是模范，但是对经营畜牧业没有经验。正好，包玉山愿意到工农村来放牧。工农村的人派了十辆大车去迎接。包玉山带着一家老小，赶着牛羊，在工农村落了户。
    包玉山到工农村来放牧，正是春天青黄不接的时候。牲畜白天放牧吃不到好草，晚上回到各家又没有棚圈；对老弱牲畜，畜主也不给贴喂草料。全村六十多头牛，有二十多头瘦得站不起，每天要人抬。他眼见牲畜这么挨冻受饿，就跑去找王国治提意见：“如今咱们人翻身了，牲畜却还在受罪哩！牛、羊不会说话，可不能这么蹧害它呀！”王国治就帮助他动员各家给牲畜搭盖棚圈，贴喂草料。有很多人缺少牛草，包玉山就到各家的柴堆上，挑些细软的野草喂牛。不到一个月，把那些半死的牛给喂活了。
    工农村的牲畜虽然合群放牧了，但是牲畜还是各家私有的。他们的牲畜原来都是在村周围放牧的，村边又没有好牧场，包玉山提出，要到远处找好牧场，出场放牧，很多人都不同意。他们不管牲畜瘦不瘦，一定要每天放在眼前看着才放心。“你们想要肥牛壮马吗？那就听我的话：人看食，马看草；放牧不找好牧场，好比种地不上粪……”包玉山见人就说，王国治也在村里开会动员，慢慢把大家的心说动了。
    包玉山赶上全村的牲畜，到村外十多里的牧场上去放牧。他在那里盖下人住的房子，掏了饮牲口的水泉。他当了工农村的牧业组长，领导着两个少年组员。包玉山白天带他们放牧，夜晚教他们识字，三个人还订了爱国公约。包玉山常说：“放牧不仅要技术，还得日夜把心放在牲畜身上，一事不经心就要出毛病”。
    过去工农村养羊不分群，把公羊和母羊混在一起放，让它们随便交配，乱下羔。这样，羔下的多，也死的多，并且影响母羊的体质。包玉山提出要公、母分群放，实行定期交配，集中在春季一次下羔。这样，大、小羊体质好；羊羔便于专人饲养保育，成活的多。许多人都不相信这办法。包玉山就和王国治商量，先把他两家的羊分群放，做出样子给大家看。他们这么放了一年，大家就看出好坏了：包玉山的羊由于定期交配，七十只母羊下了八十三只羔（有十三只母羊下了双羔），成活率达到98％；卞国钧的羊是混群放，乱交配，六十只母羊下了五十二只羔，成活率不到50％。第二年，全村的羊大部分都实行了分群放牧。
    包玉山有丰富的放牧经验，懂得各种牲畜的习性。他能根据不同的季节，水、草的质量，气候和风向的变化，随时变换放牧的方法；对牲畜出群早晚、吃草快慢，饮水多少都有很大讲究。有些人请他谈放牧经验，他坐下来一谈就是半天。他能有把握地做到，一只羊放一年能长多少肉。到时候过秤，只多不少。包玉山根据自己几十年的放牧经验，能够及时地从已经发生的事故中找出经验教训。有一次发现有些母羊流产。他和牧羊人研究的结果，立即找到流产的原因是：他们有两天出群晚，回的早；路又远，赶的急。羊跑热了，来回在河沟里喝了冷水，回去就卧在圈里，寒气散不开，怀胎的母羊就受不住了。
    包玉山在1950年来到工农村的时候，全村不过二百来头牲畜。现在全村有四百零三头牛、一百七十匹马、一千八百多只羊。六年中间，全村的牲畜增多了十一倍。
    现在，工农村已经建立了高级农业生产合作社，全村农民的牲畜都已经入社了。合作社有十三个人放牧牲畜。包玉山成了畜牧业的技术指导人。
