    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, April 14th. Today, "Pravda" published an article by Comrade Obichkin, Director of the Marxist-Leninist Institute attached to the Central Committee of the CPSU, entitled: "Lenin's Immortal Works are the Wealth of the People." The article states that Lenin's immortal works are widely disseminated in the Soviet Union and throughout the world. From 1917 to April 1, 1956, 289.77 million copies of Lenin's works were published in the Soviet Union in 82 languages.
    In accordance with the instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU regarding the need to further resolutely develop ideological work in the country, the Marxist-Leninist Institute continues to strengthen the work of publishing Lenin's works. The institute has set itself the task of publishing a supplement to the fourth edition of Lenin's Complete Works for readers in the near future, including the works seen in the third edition and the works published after the fourth edition was completed. The Marxist-Leninist Institute will also publish new editions of Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks," "Notebooks on Imperialism," and "Family Letters," and will edit notes on agricultural issues and Lenin's notes on "The Marxist Theory of the State."
    Many Soviet readers have proposed publishing a complete edition of Lenin's Complete Works, including all of Lenin's writings. Obichkin's article states that this proposal is worthy of attention. According to a preliminary study of the issue, the complete Lenin's Complete Works will be no less than fifty volumes, and it will take many years to publish it.
    Obichkin said that the thirty-sixth volume of "Lenin's Collected Works" will be published by the Marxist-Leninist Institute in a few months. The collection includes Lenin's unpublished works from the period of 1917-1922.
    Obichkin said that the institute is continuing the work of publishing Lenin's Collected Works by individual issues, and has already compiled a new collection containing the main works of Lenin on the party's theory and program on national issues.
    Obichkin said that the second edition of Lenin's biography was published in 1955. It is necessary to prepare and publish a complete scientific biography of Lenin. It is the responsibility of the scientific staff of the Marxist-Leninist Institute to complete this task as soon as possible. A historical record of Lenin's activities in 1917 will be published on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution next year.
    Obichkin said that it is planned to publish two volumes of memoirs about Lenin this year. This will be the most complete collection of memoirs about Lenin by Lenin's students, comrades-in-arms, relatives, people who worked with him for a long time, and workers and peasants who knew him.

    “真理报”载文：“列宁的不朽著作是人民的财富”
    本报莫斯科14日专电　“真理报”今天发表了苏共中央直属马克思列宁主义学院院长奥比次金的文章，题目是：“列宁的不朽著作是人民的财富”。文章中说：列宁的不朽著作在苏联和全世界传播极广。从1917年到1956年4月1日，在苏联以82种语文出版了28，977万册列宁的著作。
    根据苏共第二十次代表大会关于必须在国内进一步坚决地展开思想工作的指示，马列学院继续加强出版列宁著作的工作。学院给自己提出这样任务：在最近期间为读者出版列宁全集第四版的补遗，其中包括在第三版中见过的著作和第四版出完后才发表的著作。马列学院还将出版列宁的“哲学笔记”、“帝国主义论笔记”、“家书”等著作的新版，并在编辑农业问题笔记和列宁的笔记“马克思主义国家论”。
    许多苏联读者提议出版包括列宁所有著作的完全的列宁全集。奥比次金的文章中说：这个提议值得注意。根据对这个问题的初步研究，完全的列宁全集将不下五十卷，出版它需要多年。
    奥比次金说，马列学院几个月后将出版第三十六卷“列宁文集”。集中包括1917——1922年时期未发表的列宁的著作。
    奥比次金说，学院正继续按单个问题出版列宁文集的工作，已经编辑了新文集，把列宁在民族问题方面党的理论和纲领的主要著作都收在里面。
    奥比次金说，在1955年出版了列宁传第二版。有必要准备和出版完全的科学的列宁传记。马列学院科学工作人员的责任是尽快完成这个任务。在明年伟大十月革命四十周年的时候将出版列宁在1917年的活动的史录。
    奥比次金说，今年计划出版两卷的关于列宁的回忆录。这将是列宁的学生、战友、亲人、长期和他一起工作的人们，认识他的工人和农民关于列宁的回忆的最完全的文集。
