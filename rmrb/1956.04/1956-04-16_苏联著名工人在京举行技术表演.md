Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: Six famous Soviet metal cutting workers, invited to participate in the National Conference of Advanced Producers in the Machinery Industry, gave metal cutting technical demonstrations at the Beijing Machine Building School on the 14th. Despite limitations in equipment, the efficiency achieved was still 1.5 to several times higher than that of ordinary Chinese workers. The Chinese metal cutting workers who observed the demonstrations highly praised the Soviet workers' excellent skills.

    Vorontsov, a high-speed lathe operator from the Komintern Excavator Factory in Voronezh and a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and Shumilin, a high-speed lathe operator from the Moscow Red Proletarian Factory, demonstrated high-speed and heavy-duty cutting. Vorontsov employed three types of fixtures that he had created to greatly reduce auxiliary time, and used magnetic knives with very high hardness for cutting, achieving a cutting efficiency higher than the existing level in China. The many advanced tools used by Shumilin in his demonstration greatly interested the Chinese workers.

    Leonov, a milling worker from the Kirov Machine Building Plant in Leningrad and a recipient of the Order of Lenin, used a circular milling cutter he had improved to demonstrate large feed, high-speed cutting, achieving an efficiency more than three times higher than the current general level in China. He also taught Chinese workers on the spot how to use an end mill of his own design, which has already been widely promoted in the Soviet Union. A Chinese worker used this milling cutter to perform cutting, achieving an efficiency of about twice the existing level in China.

    Roktionov, an adjuster from the Moscow Automobile Factory, demonstrated advanced methods for adjustment and processing on a hexagonal lathe. When machining a metal part—a small sleeve—he used three cutting tools simultaneously for the inner and outer holes. In this way, one cut replaced three. It only took him more than thirty seconds to machine each small sleeve that day. A worker from the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory said that it generally took them three to four minutes to machine such parts in their factory.

    Lenkov, a gear milling worker from the Qiliangpeng Tractor Manufacturing Plant, demonstrated high-speed gear milling technology. He used ordinary Chinese milling cutters to simultaneously mill two large gear wheels with forty teeth each. According to those who participated in the calibration, the cutting speed was more than three times higher than the existing level in China.

    Korchinko, a drilling worker from the Moscow Ordzhonikidze Factory, also demonstrated high-speed drilling and the technology of tapping screws with machine tools.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: On the 14th, in the forging workshop of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, Kovalev, a Soviet forging innovator and recipient of the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and the Stalin Prize, successfully demonstrated the latest technology for producing the universal joint fork of a grain combine harvester. He forged a universal joint fork in just fifteen minutes.

    When Kovalev visited the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory the day before yesterday, he saw that forger Bi Miancai had to go through many unnecessary procedures to forge a universal joint fork, which took four hours to complete successfully. Therefore, he decided to introduce the new Soviet technology for producing universal joint forks to the workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory.

    苏联著名工人在京举行技术表演
    据新华社15日讯　应邀参加全国机械工业先进生产者代表会议的六位苏联著名的金属切削工人，十四日在北京机器制造学校进行了金属切削技术表演。这次表演尽管受到设备条件的限制，达到的效率仍然高出中国一般工人的效率一倍半到好几倍。参观表演的中国金属切削工人十分称赞苏联工人的卓越技术。
    沃洛聂夫城科明契尔掘土机工厂高速车工、苏联最高苏维埃代表沃兰佐夫、莫斯科红色无产者工厂高速车工舒米林，表演了高速和强力切削。沃兰佐夫在表演中采用了他自己创造的可以大大缩短辅助时间的三种卡具，同时用硬度很高的磁刀进行切削，切削效率高于中国现有的切削水平。舒米林在表演中采用的许多先进刀具，使中国工人感到极大的兴趣。
    来自列宁格勒基洛夫机器制造厂的铣工、列宁勋章获得者列昂诺夫，用他自己改进的圆片铣刀表演了大走刀量高速切削，效率比中国现在的一般水平提高了三倍以上。他还当场教给中国工人使用他自己设计的并且在苏联已经普遍推广的一种端铣刀。一位中国工人用这种铣刀进行切削，效率相当于中国现有水平的两倍左右。
    莫斯科汽车制造厂调整工罗克奇奥诺夫，表演了在六角车床上进行调整和加工的先进方法。他在车制一个金属零件——小套筒的内圆和外孔的时候，同时运用了三把刀具。这样，一次切削就代替了三次切削。这天他车制的每个小套筒只用了三十多秒钟。沈阳风动工具厂的一位工人说：他们工厂车制这种零件，一般要用三分到四分钟。
    齐良朋拖拉机制造厂铣齿工连科夫表演了高速铣齿的技术。他用中国的一般铣刀同时铣两个四十个齿的大牙轮。据参加标定的人说，切削速度高于中国现有水平三倍以上。
    从莫斯科奥尔忠尼启则工厂来的钻工科尔钦柯，也表演了高速钻孔和用机床套螺丝的技术。
    据新华社14日讯　十四日，在北京农业机械厂锻工车间里，列宁勋章、劳动红旗勋章和斯大林奖金获得者、苏联锻工革新者科瓦连科，成功地表演了生产谷物联合收割机自由关节叉的最新技术。他只用十五分钟就锻造成功一个自由关节叉。
    科瓦连科在前天来北京农业机械厂参观的时候，看见锻工毕绵才锻造一个自由关节叉要经过许多不必要的工序，需要四小时才能锻造成功。因此他决定向北京农业机械厂的工人介绍苏联生产自由关节叉的新技术。
