    中捷友好农业生产合作社举行命名大会
    北京市丰台区张郭庄乡农业生产合作社二十四日被命名为“中捷友好农业生产合作社”。
    中捷友好农业生产合作社主任郭荣二十四日下午在有一千人参加的命名大会上说，二十四日是我们社命名为“中捷友好农业生产合作社”的日子，也是我们社和捷克斯洛伐克维纳尔日采村建立友谊的三周年纪念日。现在，我们社的社员已经从1953年的三十四户发展到二千零三十二户，占全乡农户的98％以上。今年全社计划生产六百万斤粮食，预计每个社员可以分到纯粮六百六十斤，比去年增加一倍以上。
    捷克斯洛伐克驻华大使格里哥尔和北京市副市长吴晗先后在会上讲了话，他们向中捷友好农业生产合作社社员们表示祝贺。格里哥尔大使在会上把描绘维纳尔日采村社员们工作、生活的画册和照片，以及维纳尔日采村的农民给中捷友好农业生产合作社的信，交给了郭荣。郭荣也代表全体社员请格里哥尔大使转交给维纳尔日采村一封信。
    中捷友好农业生产合作社的社员们在会上表演了文艺节目。会后，客人们进行了参观。
    二十四日，农业部副部长蔡子伟、外交部苏联东欧司副司长陈伯清也前往祝贺。应邀参加大会的还有捷克斯洛伐克驻华大使馆人员等。（新华社）
