    有趣的化学晚会
    北京师范大学化学系学生，在三月三十一日举行了一个有趣的中学化学专题晚会。
    学生们一面讲着故事，一面用熟练的技能进行着各种化学试验。他们生动地告诉大家火药和碘发明和制造的经过和硫酸制造的各种方法的进展。他们还介绍了氯的广泛应用。三个学生因为正确、迅速地回答了很多同日常生活有关的化学问题得到了奖品。一年级的一百多学生还一起作了一种化学游戏。
    这种晚会是北京师范大学为了帮助学生和中学教师在中学开展化学课外活动，贯彻基本生产技术教育组织的。参加这次晚会的有北京师范大学化学系教师、学生和北京师范学院、河北师范专科学校以及北京市各中学的化学课教师和学生代表，约一千人。　（新华社）
