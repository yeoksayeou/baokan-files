Sowing Seeds on Newly Reclaimed Land
　　The first group of Shandong youth collective farm members who came to Heilongjiang Province to open up wasteland have recently begun sowing seeds on 1,200 hectares of newly reclaimed land. This year, they will produce 5 million jin of grain, including wheat, soybeans, and corn, on 1,700 hectares of land. After deducting production investment, public accumulation funds, and public welfare funds, each farm member will receive an average of 10,000 jin of grain this year.
　　Before sowing, the state-owned Friendship Farm used tractors to cultivate a portion of the land for the Shandong Youth Collective Farm. (Our correspondent in Harbin)

    在新开垦的土地上播种
    第一批到黑龙江省垦荒的山东青年集体农庄的庄员，最近已经开始在一千二百公顷新开垦的土地上播种。今年他们将在一千七百公顷土地上生产五百万斤小麦大豆玉米等粮食。除去生产投资和公积金、公益金外，平均每个庄员今年将分到一万斤粮食。
