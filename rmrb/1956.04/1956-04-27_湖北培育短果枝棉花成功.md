Hubei Province Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station has successfully cultivated a new variety of short-branch cotton suitable for close planting and mechanized farming. This cotton was discovered in a place called "Duck Shed" in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, in 1950, so it was named "Duck Shed Cotton."

The experiment station conducted five years of cultivation observation and comparative experiments on "Duck Shed Cotton" and seven other short-branch cotton varieties cultivated in the station. It proved that it is an excellent variety of short-branch cotton. It matures early, has high yield, good quality, and is relatively resistant to waterlogging. It is suitable for cultivation in the Jianghan Plain and the cotton-wheat double-cropping areas with more rainfall in eastern Hubei. Agricultural experimental institutions and state-owned mechanized farms in Shaanxi, Hunan and other provinces have conducted breeding experiments of the "Duck Shed Cotton" variety in the Guanzhong Plain and Dongting Lake Plain.

"Duck Shed Cotton" is a promising new cotton variety. Each mu (Chinese unit of area, approximately 1/6 of an acre) can be densely planted with up to 6,000 plants, and the average yield per mu can reach more than 100 jin (Chinese unit of weight, approximately 1.1 pounds) of lint. The cotton fiber is fine and long, and can be spun into 32-count to 42-count fine yarn.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Hubei Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station has sown ten mu of "Duck Shed Cotton" this year, and now all the cotton seedlings have emerged from the soil.

    湖北培育短果枝棉花成功
    湖北省农业综合试验站培育成功了一种适合于密植和机械化耕作的短果枝棉花的新品种。这种棉花是1950年在湖北省新洲县一个叫作“鸭棚”的地方发现的，所以命名为“鸭棚棉”。
    这个试验站曾把“鸭棚棉”同站里培育的其他七个短果枝棉花品种，作了五年的培育观察和对比试验，证明它是短果枝棉花中的优良品种，它的成熟期早、产量高、品质好，而且抗涝能力较强，适合在江汉平原和鄂东雨水较多的棉麦两熟地区栽培。陕西、湖南等省的农业试验机关和国营机械农场，已经把“鸭棚棉”良种在关中平原和洞庭湖滨平原作培育试验。
     “鸭棚棉”是很有前途的棉花新品种。每亩地可以密植到六千株，亩产量平均达到一百多斤皮棉，棉绒细长可供纺三二支到四二支的细纱。
    湖北省农业综合试验站今年播种了十亩“鸭棚棉”，现在棉苗已经全部出土。（据新华社讯）
