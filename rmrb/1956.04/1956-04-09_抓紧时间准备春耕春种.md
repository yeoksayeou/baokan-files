    Seize the Time to Prepare for Spring Plowing and Planting

    (I) To the Editor:

    The United Agricultural Production Cooperative of Yeyu Township, Pingshun County, has many problems in its spring plowing preparation work. From last winter to this spring, a period of three and a half months, very few members of this cooperative participated in labor. According to the inspection of the Sang Si Ze and Cao Gui Ze groups, each male laborer worked an average of only thirty-seven labor days, and each female laborer worked an average of only eight labor days.

    Is it that there is no work to do in the cooperative? No. This year, the cooperative plans to increase grain production by 183 jin per mu compared to last year and has formulated nine measures to increase production. There is a lot of work to be done. However, this production increase plan was only formulated by one or two leaders of the cooperative and was not discussed by the cooperative members and the management committee at all. In addition, there are also problems with the cooperative's business management and labor organization. Until mid-March, the work areas of each group had not been divided. Therefore, the members did not know what work to do, and there was a serious phenomenon of idleness; however, many urgent tasks of the cooperative were not done. For example, the increase production plan stipulated that 120 dan of fertilizer should be applied per mu, but only 40 dan were accumulated in three and a half months, leaving a shortage of 80 dan. The plan stipulated that 210 mu of cultivated land should be expanded this year, but only 20 mu had been prepared by March, and soil improvement work was not carried out at all. It is almost the Spring Equinox, and 160 mu of wheat fields have not been harrowed or hoed, and the early spring harrowing of autumn land has not started, and the seeds have not been inspected and dried at all.

    This situation has aroused dissatisfaction among the members. The leading staff of the Yeyu Township United Agricultural Cooperative should quickly find ways to catch up with the season and do a good job in spring plowing and planting; otherwise, as the old member Zhang Jukui said, it will become "empty talk and no grain harvested!"

    (II) To the Editor:

    In mid-March, we conducted a survey of the spring plowing and sowing preparation work of six agricultural production cooperatives in our county and found a number of serious problems that urgently need to be solved.

    Many spring lands in these six agricultural cooperatives had only been plowed once by mid-March. Spring lands that had been plowed two or three times had not begun deep harrowing, fine harrowing, land preparation, and moisture conservation. 38.5% of the spring land had not been fertilized, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated had not reached the planned requirements. The spring sowing seeds have not been fully prepared. Because the members generally have the idea of relying on the government, they have not taken the initiative to find ways to raise the missing seeds.

    Most of the land in these six agricultural cooperatives is suitable for planting tobacco and cotton, but in the spring sowing plan, the cotton planting area only accounts for 21.7% of the total spring land area, which is 6.9% less than the state regulations. Many members also have some ideological concerns about expanding the tobacco planting area.

    There are also some problems with the organization and deployment of labor in several cooperatives, and the phenomenon of idleness is relatively common, especially among women and semi-laborers. In the Fanpo Village Agricultural Cooperative, only about 58% of the female laborers regularly participate in well drilling and wheat watering, and most of the livestock are also idle; however, 222 mu of the cooperative's 389 mu of spring land had not been fertilized by mid-March.

    The reason for these problems is mainly that the township-level leading cadres have a blindly optimistic attitude that "the spring plowing and sowing task is not large, and there is still plenty of time," and therefore relaxed the preparation work before spring sowing. If this situation is not corrected in time, it will affect the completion of this year's agricultural production increase plan. It is recommended that all localities pay attention to this issue and conduct a thorough and detailed inspection of the preparation work before spring sowing in a timely manner.

### 抓紧时间准备春耕春种

    抓紧时间准备春耕春种
    （一）编辑同志：
    平顺县野峪乡联合农业生产合作社的春耕准备工作中有着不少问题。从去年冬天到今年春天三个半月时间，这个社的社员参加劳动的很少；据桑四则、曹贵则两
  个组的检查，每个男劳力平均只工作了三
  十七个劳动日，每个女劳力平均只工作了八个劳动日。
    是不是社里没有活做呢？不是的。今年社里计划每亩粮食要比去年增产一百八十三斤，并且订出了九项增产措施，要做的活很多。但是，这个增产计划只是由社里一两个领导人员订的，根本没有经过社员群众和社管理委员会讨论。此外，社里的经营管理和劳动组织也有问题，直到三月中旬各组的工作区还没有划分。因此，社员们不知道干什么活好，窝工现象很严重；但是社里很多紧急的活却都没有做。像增产计划上订着每亩地要施肥一百二十担，三个半月中只积了四十担，还缺八十担；计划上订着今年要扩大耕地二百一十亩，到三月份只垫了二十亩地，里砌外垫改良土壤根本没有进行。快到春分时节了，还有一百六十亩麦地没耙没锄，秋地的早春耙耢也没有开始，种子根本没有检查翻晒过。
    这种情况已经引起了社员的不满。野峪乡联合农业社领导工作人员应该赶快设法赶上季节，做好春耕春种工作；否则就会像社员张聚奎老汉所说的那样，成为“空口说白话，打不上粮食来”！

    （二）编辑同志：
    三月中旬，我们对我县六个农业生产合作社的春耕播种准备工作进行了一次调查，发现有不少急待解决的严重问题。
    这六个农业社有不少春地到三月中旬还只犁过一遍，已经犁过二遍或三遍的春地也都没有开始进行深耙、细耙、整地、保墒等工作。有38.5％的春地还没有施肥，积肥数量也没有达到计划的要求。春播的种子还没有完全准备好，由于社员们普遍存在着依赖政府的思想，因此就没有主动设法筹措缺少的种子。
    这六个农业社的大部分土地适合种植烟草和棉花，但是在春季播种计划中，棉花播种面积只占总春地面积的21.7％，比国家规定少6.9％。不少社员对扩大烟草种植面积也还有着一些思想顾虑。
    对于劳动力的组织调配，几个社也都存在着一些问题，窝工现象比较普遍，特别是妇女和男子中的半劳动力窝工的更多。范坡村农业社经常参加打井、浇麦劳动的妇女只占妇女劳力的58％左右，大部分牲口也闲着不干活；可是社里的389亩春地到三月中旬还有222亩没有施肥。
    出现这些问题的原因，主要是乡级领导干部有着“春耕播种任务不大，时间还早”的盲目乐观情绪，因而放松了春播前的准备工作。这种情况如果不及时纠正，就会影响今年农业增产计划的完成。建议各地都能注意这个问题，及时对春播前的准备工作进行一次深入细致的检查。
