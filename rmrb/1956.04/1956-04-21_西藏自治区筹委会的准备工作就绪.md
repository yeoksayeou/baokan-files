    西藏自治区筹委会的准备工作就绪
    据新华社拉萨20日电  成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的各项准备工作已经全部就绪。到昨天止，参加西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会的委员、代表等已经完成报到手续。
    在西藏晴朗的季节，盛开的桃花、浓绿的树林和新近搭好的红色彩牌，把拉萨市装扮得更加美丽。西藏地方政府噶伦索康·旺清格来和拉萨市的米本（市长）察德瓦·泽登多杰两度检查了市区环境卫生。
    作为西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会会场的拉萨大礼堂，全部落成了。这是目前西藏高原上最大的一座新建筑物。电灯安装工人、油漆工人和美术设计人员正进行最后的装饰。
    从喜马拉雅山区、山南、塔工等地区和成都、兰州等地采购的各种食品和日用品，也全部运到了拉萨。
    拉萨市有线广播站从十八日起增加了广播时间。这些天来，有线广播站已经陆续播送了达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼等祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会成立的录音讲话。
