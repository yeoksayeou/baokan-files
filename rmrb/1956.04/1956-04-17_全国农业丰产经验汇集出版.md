The "National Compilation of Agricultural Bumper Harvest Experiences," a collection of seven books promoting agricultural bumper harvest experiences from across the country, was released by the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House on the 15th.

This series was compiled by the Grain Production Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture. It includes bumper harvest experiences for grain crops such as rice, wheat, sweet potatoes, potatoes, millet, sorghum, soybeans, and corn. These valuable experiences were created by Chinese farmers in recent years. The book "Rice Bumper Harvest Experiences" promotes the experiences of farmers in Chao'an and Chenghai counties, Guangdong Province, in building water conservancy projects, overcoming various natural disasters, and comprehensively carrying out agricultural technology reforms to create counties with thousand-catty yields. This book also introduces the experience of Yunguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, in creating the highest yield of double-cropping rice in the country. The book "Wheat Bumper Harvest Experiences" introduces two types of bumper harvest experiences for wheat, both irrigated and dryland. These experiences focus on describing the key to increasing production based on local characteristics, as well as necessary measures to improve cultivation methods and planting techniques.
