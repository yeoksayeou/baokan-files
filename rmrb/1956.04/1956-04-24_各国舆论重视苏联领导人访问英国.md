International Opinion Focuses on Soviet Leaders' Visit to Britain
        Britain
    The visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain is the focus of attention in the British press. "The Times", "The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post", "The Daily Herald" and other newspapers all published the communique of the meeting between the Soviet and British leaders on April 21 in prominent positions. The "Times" diplomatic correspondent wrote: "Although the tone of the communique is cautious, it proves the willingness of both sides to improve relations." Many commentators, in referring to Bulganin's speech, pointed out the desire expressed in the speech to consolidate the friendship and cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.
          India
    Indian newspapers have published detailed reports of Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain in prominent positions. The newspapers also published excerpts from the speeches of Bulganin and Khrushchev at the luncheon at the Soviet Embassy in London, and excerpts from Bulganin's speech at the luncheon held by the Lord Mayor of London. In reporting Khrushchev's speech, the "Times of India" pointed out that the speech emphasized the need to avoid nuclear war and called for peaceful coexistence.
    "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said that the warm welcome given to Bulganin and Khrushchev by the citizens of London cannot be said to be of particular significance. After the Geneva summit, the visit of the Soviet leaders to the United Kingdom has once again provided an opportunity to ease tensions between East and West.
        Indonesia
    The Indonesian "People's Daily" editorial on April 23 said that the visit of Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain is a testament to the powerful influence of the "Geneva spirit" in the world. At the same time, this is also a proof of the spirit of coexistence and friendship between the governments and peoples of the two countries.
          Egypt
    Egyptian newspapers have published detailed accounts of the Soviet leaders' visit to London in prominent positions. They paid particular attention to the fact that British and Soviet leaders are discussing the situation in the Middle East. Egyptian newspaper reports emphasized the peaceful nature of Soviet foreign policy and the Soviet government's consistent advocacy of mutual understanding and cooperation among the people of all countries. "Al Akhbar" published an editorial on the Soviet Union's efforts to ease international tensions.
          France
    A wide range of the French public is watching Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain with great interest.
    Most political observers emphasized that the Soviet government has taken a series of very important steps to enable Soviet-British negotiations to take place in a good environment, and to promote further improvement of the international situation.
    "Echo de la Bourse" said that "Western public opinion regards this as" a "new contribution by the Soviet side to easing tensions." "L'Humanité" wrote: Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain is a historic event of the first order. Their visit to Britain is a clear demonstration of the Soviet Union's willingness to make its best efforts to end the "Cold War." The high degree of activity in Soviet diplomacy (especially in recent times) has created the conditions for this visit.
          Italy
    Italian newspapers are paying close attention to Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain with great interest. "L'Unità" published an editorial saying that the leading groups of capitalist countries are beginning to realize that the policies they have implemented so far have failed, and are beginning to realize the need to base international relations on peaceful competition between the two systems. Other newspapers also published detailed reports on the arrival of the Soviet leaders in Britain, and emphasized the warm welcome they received. (Xinhua News Agency)

    各国舆论重视苏联领导人访问英国
          英  国
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国一事是英国新闻界的注意中心。“泰晤士报”、 “每日电讯与晨邮报”、“每日先驱报”和其他报纸四月二十一日都在显著地位刊载了苏英两国领导人的会谈公报。“泰晤士报”的外交评论员写道：“虽然公报中的语气是谨慎的，但是它证明了双方愿意改善关系。”许多评论员在谈到布尔加宁的讲话的时候都指出了在讲话中表现出来的对巩固以和平共处原则为基础的英苏两国的友谊和合作的愿望。
          印    度
    印度报纸以显著地位刊载了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国的详细报道。报纸还刊载了布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫在苏联驻伦敦大使馆午宴会上的讲话摘要和布尔加宁在伦敦市长举行的午宴会上的讲话摘要。“印度时报”在报道赫鲁晓夫的讲话时指出，这篇讲话强调了避免核子战争的必要性，并且要求和平共处。
    “甘露市场报”说，伦敦市民对布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫表示的热烈欢迎，不能不说是具有特别重要意义的。在日内瓦最高级会议之后，苏联领袖们对联合王国的访问已经再一次提供了缓和东西方之间的紧张局势的机会。
        印度尼西亚
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”四月二十三日的社论说，苏联领袖布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫对英国进行的访问是“日内瓦精神”在全世界所起的强有力的影响的证明。同时这也是这两国政府和人民之间的共处精神和友谊的证明。
          埃    及
    埃及各报以显著地位刊载了苏联领袖们在伦敦访问的详细情况。它们特别注意英苏两国领袖正在讨论中东局势这一事实。埃及报纸消息强调了苏联外交政策的和平性质和苏联政府一贯主张各国人民建立互相谅解和合作的愿望。“消息报”发表社论谈到苏联进行的缓和国际紧张局势的努力。
          法    国
    法国广泛阶层的公众以巨大的兴趣注视着布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国。
    大多数政治观察家都强调指出，苏联政府采取了一系列非常重要的步骤，来使苏英谈判能够在良好的环境中进行，并且促使它能够进一步改善国际局势。
    “回声报”说，“西方公众把这件事看成”是苏联方面“对缓和紧张局势的新贡献。”“人道报”写道：布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国是具有头等意义的历史性事件。他们到英国去是苏联愿意尽最大努力结束“冷战”的明证。苏联外交上的高度积极性（特别是在最近时期）为这次访问创造了条件。
          意大利
    意大利报纸怀着很大的兴趣注意着布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国。“团结报”发表社论说，资本主义国家的领导集团开始意识到他们到现在为止所执行的政策已经破产了，开始意识到有必要以两种制度之间的和平竞赛作为国际关系的基础。其他的报纸也刊载了关于苏联领导人到达英国的详细报道，并且着重指出他们所受到的热烈欢迎。（据新华社讯）
