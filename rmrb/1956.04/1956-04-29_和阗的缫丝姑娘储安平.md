    The sericulture girls of Hotan
    Chu Anping
    Hotan has a history of silk production for over a thousand years. It is also the most concentrated area for silk production in Xinjiang. In 1941, the peak period of silk production in Xinjiang's history, Hotan alone produced more than 300 tons of raw silk annually. During the Kuomintang rule, Hotan's silk production declined year by year, and by the early years of liberation (1950), the annual production of raw silk was less than five tons.
    After liberation, the people of southern Xinjiang repeatedly requested the Party and the government to help them develop silk production and expressed their hope to build modern silk reeling factories. In 1953, the government built the "Hotan Silk Reeling Factory" in Hotan. This factory was put into production on National Day in 1954.
    While the government was constructing the factory, it also selected more than 70 minority female workers to study silk reeling technology in Suzhou. When I visited those Uyghur female workers who had been to Suzhou at the Hotan Silk Reeling Factory, they all recalled those times of studying in Suzhou with unparalleled warmth and happiness. Bai Xihan, a study model during her time in Suzhou, said, "I was so happy when I heard that the government was sending us to Suzhou to learn technology. When we arrived at the gate of the Suzhou No. 1 Silk Factory, we were lifted up by many Han elder sisters. Although we couldn't understand each other's language, we could still feel the intense and fiery emotion, as if we were close sisters who hadn't seen each other for a long time. When we arrived at the workshop and saw the machines running so fast and the Han elder sisters moving so quickly, it was almost impossible to see where the silk was. At that time, we were very worried that we wouldn't be able to learn it. However, the Han elder sisters patiently helped us. They first taught us basic movements such as knotting, threading magnetic eyes, making sheaths, and twisting additions. The technicians also gave us theoretical lessons, and then assigned us one by one to the workshop for practice. If we couldn't understand each other's language, we used gestures. If we still couldn't explain something clearly, we used objects to illustrate it. After work, they would explain things while walking along the road. Xinjiang originally had no industry. Now, the Han elder brothers are helping us minority nationalities establish industry, and the Han elder sisters are so enthusiastic in teaching us. Therefore, everyone is very grateful and unanimously vowed to learn the technology well." This group of ethnic minority female workers were serious in their studies. Especially after studying the General Line that winter, their thinking was improved and their learning progressed even faster. At first, two people managed one machine, but later they could gradually manage one machine each. At first, the silk they reeled was mostly inferior, but later their finished products also reached the AA grade standard, the same as the finished products of the Han female workers.
    Maihemuti, the vice chairman of the Hotan Silk Reeling Factory's trade union, accompanied that group of female workers to Suzhou in 1953. He said, "The Han elder brothers in the coastal areas were concerned and cared for the female workers from Hotan in every possible way. The Hotan female workers arrived in Suzhou not long before summer. They were not used to the heat of summer in the south of the Yangtze River, so the leaders specially allowed them to rest for a while at noon. There was a lot of rain and dampness in the south of the Yangtze River, and some of the female workers started to have swollen feet, so the leaders immediately sent doctors to treat them. The Uyghurs are used to eating Nang bread, but Suzhou did not have it. They wanted to make it themselves, but they didn't have a Nang stove, and no one knew how to build one. Later, the leaders tried every means to find a Hui compatriot who specially built a Nang stove to make Nang for them to eat. The Uyghurs liked to eat pilaf, but it was not easy to buy yellow carrots and mutton for making pilaf in Suzhou, so the leaders specially sent people to Shanghai to buy them. During the Corban Festival and Eid al-Adha, the leaders gave the Uyghur female workers three days off, and at the same time mobilized the Han female workers to replace them in production, so as not to affect the entire factory's production plan. During the holidays, sheep were slaughtered for them according to Uyghur customs, and they were invited to watch movies. Usually, on Sundays, many factories, schools, and organizations competed to have get-togethers with them, taking them to their homes or scenic spots to play. One female worker named Nurnisha had a miscarriage at seven months of pregnancy, and the leaders specially sent this premature baby to the hospital for incubation in a special oxygen chamber. The baby was incubated in the hospital for more than five months, until this group of female workers finished their studies, and then the baby was handed over to Nurnisha to take back to Xinjiang. In terms of learning, the factory leaders not only sent the most outstanding Han female workers to patiently teach them, but also regularly sent people to understand their learning situation and solicit their opinions. Maihemuti said: Everyone deeply realized that this is the specific manifestation of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policy."
    This group of ethnic minority female workers studied in Suzhou for a year and returned to Hotan in the spring of 1954. Later, the factory successively recruited several batches of ethnic minority female workers, who were then taught by these female workers who had returned from studying in Suzhou and some Han female technicians. Bai Xihan said, "While teaching the newly recruited female workers technology, I told them how enthusiastically the Han compatriots in Suzhou helped us, which greatly encouraged their enthusiasm for learning." I saw that most of the 450 production workers in the factory were local ethnic minority female workers. Under the training of the Party and the government, and with the help of Han female workers, they have basically been able to independently master the main operations in silk reeling.
    When the Hotan female workers returned to Xinjiang from Suzhou, 80 girls from the south of the Yangtze River responded to the call of the Party and the government and came to Hotan with this group of Uyghur female workers to support the sericulture production of fraternal ethnic groups. Some of them were graduates of Hangzhou Textile Industry School and Suzhou Xushuguan Sericulture School, some were skilled female workers from some silk factories in Wuxi, and some were newly recruited young female workers who had received short-term training in Wuxi. They were mostly only 18 or 19 years old. When they first arrived in Hotan, just like the Hotan female workers when they first arrived in Suzhou, they encountered some difficulties in various aspects. These girls had grown up eating rice since they were young, and they were not used to eating steamed buns and noodles all of a sudden. They also couldn't eat mutton. At that time, the factory building was not yet completed, the dormitory was not yet built, and the dining hall was not yet built, so everyone had to eat in the open air, and a gust of wind would blow sand into the bowls and rice bowls. Later, when the factory was put into production, they saw that the cocoons were small, the cocoon layer was thin, the silk often broke, and the water was muddy, which affected the silk color. All of this made them feel that the work was not easy to do and lacked confidence in future development. In addition, they didn't understand the language and were unfamiliar with the place, so some people's thoughts fluctuated and they couldn't concentrate on production. I met two advanced female workers in the factory, Guo Fengying and Zhu Yulan. Guo Fengying said, "I used to have incorrect ideas, thinking that there was no prospect for development here. I don't know when we will enter socialism here. I always thought of working here for three years, helping the factory train a group of new ethnic minority female workers, and then return to Wuxi. I was also afraid that the better I did my job, the harder it would be to get away in the future, so I was not active enough in my work in the early stages. Since the factory started the Party rectification study in February 1955, my ideological struggle has been very intense. With the education of the Party and the help of my comrades, I finally realized that since I am a Party member, I should obey the Party's assignment, work here with peace of mind, and take the lead in doing a good job in production. Especially now that the socialist upsurge in the rural areas of the country is developing so fast, we workers should work even harder. Now our factory is about to implement a two-shift system and will also be expanded. Everyone is very excited when they hear this news and feels that the development in the interior is also very fast." Zhu Yulan said, "The news that Beijing youth volunteered to reclaim wasteland in Heilongjiang gave us great encouragement. They are more hardship than us. At first, I thought that we didn't understand the minority languages, so it would be difficult to help the Uyghur sisters in production. Later, the leading comrades said that as long as our Han female workers do well in production, it can also inspire the Uyghur sisters to follow our example. The words of the leading comrades are absolutely correct. The Uyghur sisters are always so humbly asking us questions, and their humble learning attitude encouraged and educated us Han female workers, making us even more eager to do a good job in production."
    Among some of the Han girls who came to Hotan from the south of the Yangtze River, Zhang Shunhe, Ma Lijuan, Xu Pinmei, Yao Bingcheng and others have been able to directly use the Uyghur language to guide Uyghur female workers in their operations. Zhang Shunhe is a technician. I asked her how she learned Uyghur. She said, "When I was in Suzhou, the leaders assigned me to help the Uyghur sisters learn technology. Later, I came to Xinjiang with them, and I learned their way of speaking little by little on the way, and I also learned to eat mutton. When I arrived in Hotan, the factory recruited a batch of new workers and assigned me to be a teacher. At that time, the leading comrades encouraged us to learn Uyghur and said that learning the Uyghur language can show whether you are determined to serve the fraternal ethnic groups in the border areas. So I decided to learn Uyghur well. I cooperated with the translator Alebujiang. Before class, I told him the content of the lecture. I wrote down some relevant Uyghur names in a notebook first, and then I went to class with him. He lectured, and I listened. I wrote down what I didn't understand and asked him after class. Later, when teaching operations, I first learned some words like: 'You should stand up straighter', 'Your eyes should look over there', 'Your hands should be open wider', 'Your hands should be closer'… I started by learning words related to work, and it was easier to remember after saying them many times. Those sisters were especially happy when they saw that I could speak a few words of Uyghur, and it was especially easy for us to get close. They always took the initiative to come and ask me about any difficulties they had in learning. Every day after work, many ethnic minority sisters would run to my room to chat and laugh with me affectionately."
    Under the continuous education and concern of the Party, these girls who came from the south of the Yangtze River are now working in Hotan with peace of mind. Wei Yulin, the leader of the youth production team, said, "We didn't care enough about the construction of Xinjiang at first, but now everyone is very concerned about the construction of Xinjiang and is very excited to see that the various constructions in the border areas of the motherland are also developing so fast. Now we are all making long-term plans here. Let me tell you a joke: In the past, when we bought thermos bottles, we only bought bamboo-shell ones. Now, when we buy thermos bottles, we have to buy iron-shell ones."

    和阗的缫丝姑娘
    储安平
    和阗的蚕丝生产已经有一千多年历史。这儿也是新疆蚕丝生产最集中的地方。1941年是新疆历史上蚕丝生产的最盛期，和阗一地年产生丝三百多吨。在国民党统治时期，和阗的蚕丝生产逐年下降，到解放初期（1950年），年产生丝不足五吨。
    解放以后，南疆人民一再要求党和政府帮助他们发展蚕丝生产，并希望修建现代化的缫丝工厂。1953年，政府在和阗兴建“和阗缫丝厂”。这个厂已在1954年的国庆节投入生产。
    政府一面施工建厂，一面选派了七十多名少数民族女工到苏州去学习缫丝技术。当我在和阗缫丝厂访问那些去过苏州的维族女工的时候，她们一提起在苏州学习的那一段情况，都引起一种无比温暖的和幸福的回忆。在苏州学习期间的学习模范白西汉说：“我听到政府送我们到苏州去学习技术的时候，就高兴得不得了。到了苏州，我们刚在苏州第一丝厂门口下车，便被许多汉族大姊抬了起来。虽然言语不通，但是我们依然能够体会到犹如亲生姊妹好久没见似的那种强烈的火热的感情。我们到了车间，只见机器转动很快，汉族大姊动作敏捷，简直使人瞧不见丝在什么地方，那时我们心中又有很多顾虑，怕自己学不上。但是汉族大姊一直耐心地帮助我们。她们先教我们如何打结、穿磁眼、做鞘、捻添等等基本动作，技术员又给我们上理论课，接着就把我们一个一个分配到车间实习。言语不通就用手比，实在说不明白的事情，便用实物来说明。下了班在路上也是边走边解说。新疆本来没有工业，现在汉族老大哥帮助我们少数民族建立工业，汉族大姊又这样热心教我们，所以大家都很感激，一致保证要把技术学好。”这批民族女工在学习上是认真的，尤其那年冬天学习了总路线以后，思想提高一步，学习进步更快。她们最初是两个人管一台车，后来逐渐可以一人管一台车了。她们最初缫出来的丝都是一些次品，后来她们的成品也达到了双A级的标准，同汉族女工的成品一样了。
    和阗缫丝厂的工会副主席买合木提，1953年曾经陪同那批女工一起去苏州。他说：“沿海汉族老大哥对从和阗去的女工关切照料，无微不至。和阗女工到达苏州不久，就入夏季。她们不习惯江南暑天的炎热，领导人便特别让她们在中午休息一个时候。江南雨多，地气较湿，有些女工开始脚肿，领导上便立刻派医生给她们治疗。维族习惯吃馕，但是苏州没有馕。想自己做，又没有馕灶，也没有人会砌馕灶。后来领导人多方设法，终于找到了一个回族同胞，专门砌了馕灶，做馕给她们吃。维族喜欢吃抓饭，苏州不容易买到做抓饭用的黄萝卜和羊肉，领导人就专门派人到上海去买。过肉孜节和库尔班节的时候，领导人给维族女工放假三天，同时动员汉族女工代替她们生产，以免影响整个厂的生产计划。过节的时候，按照维族的习惯给她们宰了羊，又请她们看电影。平时一到星期日，很多工厂、学校、机关争着和她们联欢，带她们上家里或风景区玩。有一个女工叫奴尔尼莎，怀孕七个月小产了，领导人特地把这个不足月的孩子送到医院里去用特备的养气箱保育。在医院里保育了五个多月，一直保育到这批女工学习完毕，才把孩子交给奴尔尼莎带回新疆。在学习上，厂的领导人不仅派最优秀的汉族女工耐心教她们，还经常派人来了解她们的学习情况，征求她们的意见。买合木提说：大家深切地体会到这就是共产党和毛主席的民族政策的具体表现。”
    这批少数民族女工在苏州学习了一年，1954年春天回到和阗。以后厂里陆续招收了好几批少数民族女工，就由这些从苏州学习回来的女工和部分汉族女技术员教她们。白西汉说：“我一面教那些新招的女工学技术，一面就给她们讲苏州汉族同胞是怎样热情地帮助我们，这样大大鼓舞了她们的学习情绪。”我看到全厂四百五十名生产工人中，大部分是当地的少数民族女工。在党和政府的培养下，在汉族女工的帮助下，她们已经基本上能够独立掌握缫丝作业中的主要操作了。
    在和阗女工从苏州回新疆的时候，有八十名江南女孩子响应党和政府的号召，同这批维族女工到和阗来支援兄弟民族的缫丝生产。她们有些是杭州纺织工业学校和苏州浒墅关蚕桑学校的毕业生，有些是无锡一些丝厂的熟练女工，有些是新招的并在无锡受过短期训练的青年女工。她们大都只有十八九岁。她们初到和阗，正如和阗女工初到苏州一样，在各方面都遇到一些困难。这些女孩子从小都是吃大米长大的，一下子吃蒸馍和面条，吃不惯。羊肉也吃不来。当时厂房还没完工，宿舍还没造好，饭厅还没修建，大家只好在露天里吃饭，一阵风把黄沙也刮进了菜碗饭碗。后来工厂投入生产了，但她们看到茧子小、茧层薄，丝时常断，水又浑混，影响丝色。这一切都使她们感到工作不好做，对前途发展缺乏信心。再加言语不通，人生地疏，所以有些人思想波动，不能安心生产。我会晤了厂里两个先进女工过凤英和朱玉兰。过凤英说：“我过去一直有不正确的想法，认为这里没有发展前途。这里要进入社会主义还不知道要等到什么时候。心里老想在这儿做上三年，帮助厂里培养出一批新的民族女工以后，就回无锡。我又怕越是工作做得好，将来越难脱身，所以初期工作不够积极。自从1955年2月厂里开始整党学习以后，我的思想斗争很剧烈。在党的教育和同志们的帮助下，我终于认清：我既是一个党员，就应该服从党的分配，安心在这儿工作，并且要带头做好生产。尤其现在全国农村中的社会主义高潮发展得这样快，我们工人更应该加紧努力。现在我们厂里就要实行双班制，还要扩建，听到这些消息大家都很兴奋，感到内地的发展也很快。”朱玉兰说：“北京青年志愿去黑龙江垦荒的新闻给我们很大的鼓舞。他们比我们更艰苦。我最初以为我们不懂少数民族语言，在生产上很难帮助维族姊妹。后来领导同志说，只要我们汉族女工生产得好，也就可以激发维族姊妹向我们看齐。领导同志的话说得一点不错。维族姊妹总是那样虚心地找我们问这问那，他们那种虚心的学习态度鼓舞并教育了我们汉族女工，使我们格外要把生产做好。”
    从江南来和阗的一些汉族姑娘中，像张顺和、马丽娟、许品梅、姚冰澄等都已经能够直接用维吾尔语言指导维吾尔族女工操作了。张顺和是技术员，我问她是怎样学习维语的？她说：“我在苏州的时候，上级就分配我帮助维吾尔族姊妹学技术。后来和她们一起来新疆，在路上我就一点一点学习她们的说话，并学着吃羊肉。到了和阗，厂里招收了一批新工人，也派我担任教员。那时领导同志鼓励我们学维文，并说学习维吾尔族语言就可以表示你是否决心在边疆为兄弟民族服务。这样我就决心想把维文学好。我和翻译阿乐布江同志合作，上课以前我先把讲课的内容告诉他，我把一些有关的维文名字先在簿子上记下来，这样我便跟他一起去上课。由他讲，我旁听。听不懂的地方我就记下来，下了课再问他。后来教操作，我就先学这样一些话：身体应该立直些、眼睛应该看哪儿、手应该放开些、手应该放拢些……先从和工作有关的话学起，说的次数多了，也就容易记住了。那些姊妹们看到我能说几句维语，都特别高兴，我们之间就格外容易接近。她们在学习上有什么困难，总是主动地来找我问我。每天下班后，也总有许多少数民族姊妹们跑到我房间里来，亲昵地和我谈笑。”
    在党不断的教育和关切下，这批从江南来的女孩子，现在都已安心在和阗工作了。青年生产组长韦玉林说：“我们起先对新疆的建设不够关心，可是现在大家都很关心新疆的建设，看到祖国边疆的各项建设也发展得这样快，都很兴奋。现在我们在这儿都作长期打算了。说个笑话吧：从前我们买暖壶，都只买竹壳子的，现在，买起暖壶来，就都要买铁皮壳子的了。”
