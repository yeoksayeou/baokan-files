In January, we received a letter from reader Liang Bixin, reflecting that some staff members of the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau in Jiangsu Province did not observe labor discipline during working hours and were very impatient with comrades who came to discuss work.

We forwarded this reader's letter to the Dongtai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. More than a month later, the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau sent a reply letter. In the first part of this reply letter, the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau believed that the reader's criticism was correct, admitting that the leadership had not done a good job in the political education of some comrades, and said that the comrades concerned had made self-criticisms. But immediately afterwards, they raised some questions to the reader.

The reply letter stated: "Regarding Comrade Liang's letter, we have a few illusions, please correct us.

\t1. Comrade Liang said that the desks in our bureau are not arranged properly, like a university. If they are not arranged this way, how should they be arranged?

\t2. The office hours of our bureau are from 8:30 am (with one hour of political study before 8:30 am) to 11:30 am, from 1:00 pm to 4:30 pm, and from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Comrade Liang still thinks there is a problem with these office hours. What is the problem?

\t3. Comrade Liang used some trivial matters (such as laughing, moving chairs, running around, asking questions, etc.) as the content of his criticism in his letter, which is a bit like nitpicking."

Indeed, just as the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau itself said, these questions are not correct opinions, but only "illusions" or similar statements. When reader Liang Bixin described the scene he saw at the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau in his letter, he mentioned that the office had "seven or eight single desks, arranged facing one direction, like a classroom," but did not criticize this arrangement as being bad. Reader Liang Bixin mentioned the issue of working hours several times in his letter of criticism, mainly to illustrate that some staff members of the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau were lax in labor discipline during this period, and only casually mentioned whether it was appropriate to stipulate office hours in this way; and whether this arrangement of office hours is appropriate is indeed worth studying. These two points were not the main content of the letter of criticism, but the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau raised questions unnecessarily. The main content of reader Liang Bixin's letter of criticism was to reflect that some staff members of the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau did not observe labor discipline, which was precisely illustrated by the specific facts of these staff members chatting, joking, eating, washing clothes, and sunbathing during working hours. However, the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau described these facts as trivial matters and believed that the reader's reflection of these facts was "nitpicking." The fact is very clear that the one who is "nitpicking" is not the reader who wrote the letter of criticism, but the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau. Their "illusions" in the latter part of the reply letter precisely negated the self-criticism in the first part of the reply letter.

We demand that the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau correct its attitude towards criticism and not seize on individual words and phrases in the letter of criticism to develop "illusions"; only in this way can they truly accept criticism and improve their work.

### 东台县公安局的“错觉”

    东台县公安局的“错觉”
    一月份，我们接到读者梁必心的一封来信，反映江苏省东台县公安局某些工作人员在工作时间内不遵守劳动纪律，对来接洽工作的同志态度表现得很不耐烦。
    我们把这封读者来信转给了中共东台县委会。一个多月后，东台县公安局寄来了一封答复信。在这封答复信的前一部分，东台县公安局认为读者的批评是正确的，承认领导方面对某些同志政治教育工作做得不好，并且说有关同志已经作了检讨。但是紧接着，他们却对读者提出了一些责问。
    答复信里是这样说的：“对于梁同志的来信，我们有几个错觉，请你们指正。
    一，梁同志说我局的办公桌子摆得不当，像个高等学校。不这样摆，又应该如何摆法？
    二，我局的办公时间，是上午八时半（八时半之前有一小时政治学习）到十一时半，下午一时到四时半，晚上六时半到八时半。这样的办公时间，梁同志还认为有问题，问题在何处？
    三，梁同志在信中将一些零星小事（如笑、搬椅子、跑路、问话等）来作为他批评的内容，未免有些钻空子。”
    的确，正如东台县公安局自己所说的那样，这些责问并不是正确的意见，而只能是“错觉”之类的说法。读者梁必心在来信中叙述他在东台县公安局所看到的景象的时候，提到了办公室里“有七、八个单人办公桌，像学校上课似的，摆得朝向一方”，但是并没有指摘这样的摆法不好。读者梁必心在批评信中几次提到了工作时间问题，主要是为了说明在这段时间内东台县公安局某些工作人员劳动纪律松弛，只是顺便提了一句办公时间这样规定是否合适；而且这样安排办公时间是否妥善，也的确值得研究。这两点都不是批评信的主要内容，东台县公安局却毫无必要地提出了责问。读者梁必心这封批评信的主要内容是反映东台县公安局某些工作人员不遵守劳动纪律，这一点正是用这些工作人员在工作时间内闲谈、开玩笑、吃东西、洗衣服、晒太阳等具体事实来说明的。东台县公安局却把这些事实说成是零星小事，而且认为读者反映这些事实是“钻空子”。事实很明显，“钻空子”的不是写批评信的读者，而是东台县公安局。他们在答复信后一部分的“错觉”，正好否定了答复信的前一部分的检讨。
    我们要求东台县公安局端正对批评的态度，不要抓住批评信中个别字句而发生“错觉”；只有这样，才能真正地接受批评，改进自己的工作。
