Xinhua News Agency, April 21st, Copenhagen Dispatch: Icelandic Foreign Minister Guðmundsson said to a reporter from the "Copenhagen News" on April 18th, when discussing the Icelandic Parliament's resolution demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland: It is always unpleasant to have foreign troops stationed in one's own country. Wherever the United States "has bases, there are frictions between Americans and the local people. It is undeniable that Icelanders are, in principle, opposed to having foreign bases on their territory."

Guðmundsson said: There is absolutely no reason for the uproar in the American newspapers. Iceland and the United States have an agreement, and the Icelandic Parliament's resolution to demand the withdrawal of American troops is "completely in accordance with this agreement."

    冰岛外交部长谈冰岛议会要求美军撤出冰岛的决议
    新华社21日讯  哥本哈根消息：冰岛外交部长格德门森四月十八日在向“哥本哈根消息报”记者谈到冰岛议会要求美国军队撤出冰岛的时候说：在自己的国家里驻扎有外国军队总是不愉快的。只要美国“有基地的地方，美国人和当地人民之间就有磨擦。不可否认冰岛人在原则上反对在他们的领土上有外国基地”。
    格德门森说：美国报纸的叫嚷，是根本没有理由的。冰岛和美国有一个协定，冰岛议会要求撤退美军的决议“完全符合这个协定”。
