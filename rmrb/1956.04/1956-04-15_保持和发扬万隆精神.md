    Chairman of the Indonesian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Group Says
    Welcomes Soviet Assistance in Developing Heavy Industry
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 14th (by telegram) - According to a report by Antara News Agency, Mrs. Pujo Bono, Chairman of the Indonesian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Group, commented on the results of the Ceylon elections on April 13th, saying that the victory of the People's United Front led by Bandaranaike, who advocates that his government adopt a policy of neutralism, is another event that is conducive to the independent foreign policy currently being pursued by some Asian countries.
    Mrs. Pujo Bono explained that Asian nationalism is not just nationalism, but nationalism that hopes to implement social reforms. Ceylon's new Prime Minister Bandaranaike, in his speeches and talks during his campaign, has promised to implement social reforms for the people of Ceylon. She said: "For us Indonesians, the results of the Ceylon elections mean that another country approves of our policy of not joining any bloc."
    She also talked about the issue of Soviet economic aid to Indonesia. She said: "For us who pursue a neutral policy, it is very important to carefully study whether this aid is beneficial to our people. If this aid is beneficial to our people, we are willing to accept it, as long as it does not have political or military conditions attached." She said that she is willing to accept aid like the Soviet Union gave to India, that is, to help build steel plants or other heavy industries. She said that Indonesia is in great need of heavy industry, especially in terms of national construction within the scope of Indonesia's first five-year plan.
    Mrs. Pujo Bono is also willing to agree to the kind of assistance that the Soviet Union provided to China: assistance in industrialization, including the dispatch of technical personnel. She finally said: "I think that other countries, including the United States, should also provide this kind of economic assistance without any political or military conditions attached."
    Sastroamidjojo Suggests Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Asian-African Conference
    Indian "New Age" Weekly Points Out That the Bandung Spirit Has Gained New Victories
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 14th (by telegram) - According to a report by Antara News Agency, an Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on April 13th that Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo has sent telegrams to the governments of all the other twenty-eight countries that participated in the Asian-African Conference last year, suggesting that these countries commemorate the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference.
    The telegram said that Indonesia will celebrate the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference on April 18th this year. Indonesia is doing this in order to "maintain and promote the spirit of the Asian-African Conference." Sastroamidjojo expressed in the telegram his firm belief that the spirit of the Asian-African Conference is prevailing among the people of the countries participating in the conference.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 14th - The latest issue of the "New Age" weekly published an article commemorating the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference. The article pointed out that in the past year, despite the intensified efforts of the imperialists to undermine the achievements of the Bandung Conference, to encircle and enslave Asian-African countries and to interfere in their internal affairs, the Bandung spirit has still achieved significant new victories.
    The article, in talking about the growing friendship between the people of Asian-African countries and the countries of the socialist camp, said, "In the year since the Bandung Conference, the two largest and most powerful anti-imperialist, peace-loving forces of our time have also moved closer together, and the union of these two forces will mean the demise of colonialism."
    The article also emphasized the firm support of the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp for the Bandung Conference. The article, in mentioning their proposals for economic and technical cooperation to Asian-African countries, pointed out, "This cooperation will enable Asian-African countries to more effectively combat the colonial system and all the cunning plots of the imperialists."
    The article went on to say that the Bandung Conference is not only beneficial to the enslaved people of the East, but it also greatly contributes to bringing a new atmosphere to the world and easing international tensions.
    The article calls on the Indian people, who played a proud role in promoting the convening of the Bandung Conference, to further strengthen solidarity with Asian-African countries and step up the opposition to military treaties that enslave and create war.

    Khim Tit said that the neutral policy adopted by Cambodia is in line with the interests and wishes of the Cambodian people. He reiterated that the current Cambodian government continues to pursue the policy formulated by Prince Sihanouk.

    Thai Socialist Party Leader
    Advocates Implementing an Independent and Peaceful Coexistence Policy
    According to Xinhua News Agency - According to Thai newspapers, Nai Wisit Siphotharat and Nai Wang Nabotharong, leaders of the Thai Socialist Party, which was established in early March this year, said at a press conference on April 4th that the Socialist Party opposes the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and opposes war, because only some countries that sell arms benefit from war.

    British "Economist"
    Talks About Anti-American Sentiment in the Philippines
    Xinhua News Agency, April 14th - London dispatch: The British "Economist" magazine said on the 13th that the hot wind of nationalism blowing across Asia has even blown to the Philippines - "the West's strong outpost in the Far East."
    The magazine said: Filipinos are dissatisfied with Americans on many things. They are airing their grievances in a tough attitude that has apparently alarmed Washington. It also said that this criticism in the Philippines is non-partisan.
    The "Economist" said: "As always, there are also economic factors. Manila's powerful sugar lobby is furious because a US congressman has suggested cutting the Philippine sugar import quota in retaliation for Manila's restrictions on imports of US tobacco."
    The magazine also said that some Filipinos hope to experiment with trade with China. Others are also dissatisfied when comparing the US's recent $65 million loan to the Philippines with the US's aid to other Asian countries.

    保持和发扬万隆精神
    印度尼西亚国会外交小组主席说
    欢迎苏联帮助发展重工业
    新华社雅加达14日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚国会外交小组主席普佐邦托罗夫人四月十三日在评论锡兰选举的结果时说，以主张他的政府采取中立主义的班达拉奈克为首的人民联合阵线所取得的胜利，是有利于目前一些亚洲国家正在奉行的独立外交政策的又一件事情。
    普佐邦托罗夫人解释说，亚洲的民族主义并不只是民族主义而已，而是希望实行社会改革的民族主义，锡兰新总理班达拉奈克在他进行竞选的时候所发表的演说和谈话中已经答应为锡兰人民实行社会改革。她说：“对于我们印度尼西亚人说来，锡兰选举的结果意味着，又有一个国家赞成我国的不参加任何集团的政策。”
    她还谈到苏联给予印度尼西亚以经济援助的问题。她说：“对于奉行中立政策的我们说来，仔细研究这种援助是否对我国人民有利，这是很重要的。如果这种援助对我国人民有利，我们就愿意接受它，只要它不附有政治条件或军事条件。”她说，她愿意接受像苏联给予印度的那样的援助，即帮助建立炼钢厂或其他重工业。她说，印度尼西亚非常需要重工业，特别是在印度尼西亚第一个五年计划范围内的国家建设方面。
    普佐邦托罗夫人也愿意同意苏联对中国的那种形式的援助：帮助工业化的援助，包括派遣技术人员在内。她最后说：“我认为，其他国家，包括美国在内，也应该提供不附带任何的政治或军事条件的这种经济援助。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约建议庆祝亚非会议一周年
    印度“新世纪”周刊指出万隆精神获得了新胜利
    新华社雅加达14日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚外交部发言人四月十三日说，印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约已经向去年参加亚非会议的所有其他二十八个国家的政府发出电报，建议这些国家纪念亚非会议一周年。
    电报说，印度尼西亚将在今年四月十八日庆祝亚非会议一周年。印度尼西亚这样作是为了“保持和发扬亚非会议的精神”。沙斯特罗阿米佐约在电报中表示深信，亚非会议的精神在参加会议的各国的人民中间是盛行的。
    新华社新德里14日电　最近一期的“新世纪”周报发表了一篇纪念亚非会议一周年的文章。这篇文章指出，在过去一年中，尽管帝国主义者加紧努力来破坏万隆会议的成就、来包围和奴役亚非国家并且干涉它们的内政，但是万隆精神还是获得了显著的新胜利。
    文章在谈到亚非各国人民同社会主义阵营国家的日益增长的友谊的时候说，“在万隆会议以来的一年中，我们时代的两支最大的、最有力的反帝国主义的爱好和平的力量也更加接近了，这两个力量联合起来将意味着殖民主义的灭亡”。
    文章还着重地谈到苏联和社会主义阵营的其他国家对于万隆会议的坚决支持。文章在提到它们向亚非国家所提出的经济和技术合作建议的时候指出，“这种合作将使亚非国家能够更有效地对殖民制度和帝国主义者的一切狡猾阴谋进行斗争”。
    文章接着说，万隆会议不仅对被奴役的东方人民有好处，它还大大地有助于给全世界带来新的气氛、缓和国际紧张局势的气氛。
    文章要求在促成万隆会议的召开方面起了值得自豪的作用的印度人民进一步加强同亚非国家的团结，加紧反对进行奴役的和制造战争的军事条约。

    新华社河内14日电　据金边电台广播：柬埔寨王国首相钦·迪在四月十三日的柬埔寨新年发表贺词，号召柬埔寨全体人民为保卫柬埔寨的和平、独立和中立地位而斗争。
    钦·迪说，柬埔寨采取的中立政策是符合于柬埔寨人民的利益和愿望的。他重申，现在的柬埔寨政府继续奉行由西哈努克亲王制定的政策。他强调柬埔寨主张和一切国家建立关系，并且指出西哈努克亲王已经加强了和中华人民共和国的友好关系。
    在同一天，柬埔寨王国会议议长写信向西哈努克亲王贺年，信中表示王国会议要“不惜一切牺牲”来追随西哈努克制定的中立政策。
    泰国社会主义党领袖
    主张实行独立和和平共处政策
    据新华社讯　据泰国报纸报道，今年三月初成立的泰国社会主义党的领袖乃威实·诗博他拉和乃旺·纳博他隆四月四日在记者招待会上说，社会主义党反对东南亚条约组织，反对战争，因为在战争中获得利益的只是一些出卖军火的国家。他们还表示了社会主义党的反对殖民主义的态度。社会主义党主张同一切国家进行贸易，特别是同中国进行直接的贸易。
    英国“经济学家”
    谈菲律宾的反美情绪
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：英国“经济学家”杂志十三日说，吹遍整个亚洲的民族主义热风甚至吹到了菲律宾——“西方在远东的这个坚强前哨据点”。
    这家杂志说：菲律宾人在许多事情上对美国人感到不满。他们正用一种强硬的态度来鸣不平，这种强硬态度显然已经使华盛顿惊惶失措。它又说，这种批评在菲律宾已经是不分党派。
    “经济学家”说：“同往常一样，还有经济上的因素。马尼拉的有势力的院外食糖集团由于一个美国议员建议削减菲律宾的食糖进口限额来对马尼拉的限制输入美国烟草进行报复而感到愤怒。”
    这家杂志又说，某些菲律宾人希望同中国试行贸易。还有一些人在把美国最近给予菲律宾的六千五百万美元的贷款同美国给予其他亚洲国家的援助比较起来的时候也感到不满。
