Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd: US Democratic leader and Democratic presidential nomination contender Adlai Stevenson delivered a speech at the American Newspaper Editors Association banquet on April 21, criticizing the Republican government's foreign policy. Several hours after Stevenson's speech, US President Eisenhower also delivered a speech on foreign policy at the same association.

Stevenson said that American foreign policy in the past three years had been "handled so poorly" that "we must now try to prove that we love peace as much as the Russians, and that we care about economic development and national independence as much as the Russians." Stevenson accused the Republican government of "clinging to the military aspects it emphasizes in alliance treaties, foreign aid, trade, and various international exchanges," and said: "Many people in the world already consider us militarists, even a threat to peace." Stevenson called for "prompt and sincere consideration of stopping hydrogen bomb tests" to "change" the world's perception of the United States.

Stevenson said that in the past three years, the United States has "clearly lost the initiative" "economically, militarily, and, worse, morally," and these are "the prelude to losing leadership."

Stevenson said that time is running out, and he called for a "re-examination and redefinition of American policy to meet today's challenges."

    美国民主党领袖史蒂文森
    抨击共和党政府外交政策
    新华社22日讯  华盛顿消息：美国民主党领袖、民主党总统候选人提名竞争者史蒂文森四月二十一日在美国报纸编辑协会宴会上发表演说，抨击共和党政府的外交政策。在史蒂文森发表演说后数小时，美国总统艾森豪威尔也在这个协会发表了外交政策的演说。
    史蒂文森说，美国外交政策在过去三年中“处理得如此不当”，以致“我们现在必须设法证明我们像俄国人一样地爱和平，像俄国人一样地关心经济发展问题和民族独立问题”。史蒂文森指责共和党政府 “死抱住它在同盟条约、援外、贸易和各种国际交流中所强调的军事方面”，他说： “世界上许多人已经认为我们是军国主义者，甚至是对和平的威胁。”史蒂文森要求 “迅速而诚恳地考虑停止试验氢弹”以“改变”世界对美国的印象。
    史蒂文森说，过去三年来，美国“在经济、军事、更坏地是在道义方面”“明显地丧失了主动权”，而这些就是“丧失领导权的序幕”。
    史蒂文森说，时间已经迫不及待，他要求“重新研究和重新确定美国的政策以应付今天的挑战”。
