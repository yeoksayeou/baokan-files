    National Cotton Pre-Purchase Plan Completed Over 97%
    The national cotton pre-purchase plan for this year has been completed by 97.32%. The pre-purchase volume increased by more than 60% compared to last year.
    This year's cotton pre-purchase work was carried out after the high tide of agricultural cooperativization arrived and in a situation where a high tide of agricultural production had already formed. The main targets of the state's cotton pre-purchase this year have changed from the past millions of small producers to agricultural production cooperatives. Throughout the country, except for a few areas, the proportion of cotton pre-sold by agricultural production cooperatives is around 95%, and the number of contracts has been greatly reduced accordingly. For example, Hebei Province signed a total of 15,147 pre-purchase contracts this year, with an average of 50,760 jin of ginned cotton per contract; last year, a total of 294,835 contracts were signed, with an average of 1,567 jin of ginned cotton per contract. Comparing the two years, the amount of cotton pre-purchased per contract this year increased more than thirty-one times compared to last year.

    全国棉花预购计划完成97％多
    全国今年棉花预购计划已完成97.32％。预购量比去年增长了60％以上。
    今年的棉花预购工作，是在农业合作化高潮到来以后和农业生产高潮已经形成的情况下进行的。国家今年预购棉花的主要对象，已从过去的千百万小生产者改变为农业生产合作社。全国除少数地区外，农业生产合作社预售棉花的比重都在95％左右，合同份数随之大大减少。如河北省今年共签订预购合同15，147份，平均每份预购皮棉50，760斤；去年共签订合同294，835份，平均每份预购皮棉1，567斤。两年比较，今年每份合同预购的棉花比去年增加三十一倍多。
