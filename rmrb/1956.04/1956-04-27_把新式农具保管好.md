The San Tai Zi Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kaiyuan County, Liaoning Province, has sixteen double-wheeled double-share plows, as well as some seeders, weeder? machines, rollers, and nail-tooth harrows. These new-style farm tools were all purchased last year. This cooperative does not pay attention to the maintenance of new-style farm tools. Most of the new-style farm tools have been left outside since they were used last year, exposed to wind and rain. Some put the double-wheeled double-share plows on low-lying, damp ground, and some used the rollers as barriers for the threshing ground. As a result, some farm tools lost parts, and some double-wheeled double-share plows rusted and could not be used.

New-style farm tools are valuable assets of the cooperative. Poor maintenance will not only cause losses but also hinder production. Every cooperative should establish a system of responsibility for the maintenance and use of new-style farm tools to ensure they are well taken care of.

    把新式农具保管好
    辽宁省开原县三台子前进农业生产合作社有十六部双轮双铧犁，还有一些播种机、铲?机、镇压器、钉齿耙等。这些新式农具都是去年买的。这个社对新式农具不注意爱护。大部分新式农具从去年使用完了以后，一直放在外边，任风吹雨淋。有的把双轮双铧犁放在低湿的地上，有的镇压器被用去做场院的屏障。结果，有的农具丢了零件，有的双轮双铧犁锈的不能用了。
    新式农具是合作社的宝贵财产，保管不好，不但会造成损失，而且会妨害生产。每一个合作社都要在新式农具的保管和使用方面建立责任制度，把新式农具保管好。
