The Ministry of Water Resources convened a meeting on farmland irrigation in thirteen southern provinces and cities in Hangzhou from April 15th to 25th. During the winter of last year and the spring of this year, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Shanghai launched a mass campaign to build water conservancy projects during the agricultural cooperation movement. As of the end of March, the irrigated area had increased by 48.22 million mu. It is estimated that by the end of April, it will reach 58.2 million mu, which is more than double the total irrigated area increased by the thirteen provinces and cities in the six years since liberation.

The meeting discussed the guiding principles for farmland irrigation and finally made the following decisions: (1) Strive to complete and exceed this year's plan, and comprehensively implement the principle of "more, faster, better, more economical, and safe." It is required to not only complete the tasks but also ensure quality and eliminate accidents; (2) Vigorously develop mass-based small-scale water conservancy projects, and strengthen leadership and technical guidance for small-scale water conservancy projects. Provincial departments (bureaus) should provide support for the funds needed for training farmer technicians and demonstration visits; (3) The construction of water conservancy projects should continue to implement the principle of "people-run with government assistance" and the principle of "low cost and high efficiency."

    南方各省灌溉面积增加四千多万亩
    四月十五日至二十五日，水利部在杭州召开了南方十三个省、市的农田水利会议。去冬今春浙江、福建、江苏、江西、安徽、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、四川、贵州、云南、上海等十三个省、市在农业合作化运动中掀起了群众性的兴修水利运动。截至三月底止，增加灌溉面积4，822万亩，预计到四月底可达到5，820万亩，相当于解放六年来十三个省、市增加灌溉面积总数的一倍以上。
    会议对农田水利的方针问题进行了讨论，最后作出决定：（一）努力完成和争取超额完成今年的计划，全面贯彻执行“多、快、好、省和安全”的方针，要求既要完成任务，又要保证质量、消灭事故；（二）大力开展群众性的小型水利，加强对小型水利的领导和技术指导，各省厅（局）对于训练农民技术员和示范参观所需经费应该给以支持；（三）兴修水利仍需进一步贯彻“民办公助”的方针和“费省效宏”的原则。
