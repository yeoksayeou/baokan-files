    The splitting trend of the North Atlantic Group has recently become a topic of discussion in the Western bourgeois press. In this regard, the situation in West Germany, which is regarded by the American ruling group as the pillar of the North Atlantic Group, has particularly made Washington uneasy recently. There, the development of the situation more and more powerfully shows that the Adenauer Group, on which the promoters of the American "position of strength" policy pinned their hopes, is increasingly losing power and becoming isolated.
    Recently, a noteworthy development is that on February 20, in the parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia, the most important, most industrialized, and most populous state in West Germany, the Free Democratic Party, the second largest party in the West German government coalition, and the opposition Social Democratic Party jointly overthrew the Christian Democratic Union government. As a result, the Adenauer Group expelled the Free Democratic Party from the government coalition in anger, causing an open split in the West German government coalition. Then, in the Baden-Württemberg state election held in early March, the Adenauer party lost a large number of votes.
    The West German government coalition was formed in 1953 by four bourgeois parties: the Christian Democratic Union, the Free Democratic Party, the "All-German Bloc," and the German Party. These parties represent different interest groups of the West German bourgeoisie. They came together to hold a two-thirds majority of seats in both the Federal Assembly and the Senate. Adenauer has always relied on this group of bourgeois parties to promote the policy of reviving German militarism and joining West Germany into the Western military bloc. However, since last year, this alliance of right-wing parties has begun to disintegrate. First, the "All-German Bloc" experienced internal splits, resulting in the party's withdrawal from the government coalition, shaking the foundation of the government coalition. The recent break between the Free Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Union has further weakened the position of the government coalition. Now, only the Christian Democratic Union, the small German Party, and some defectors from the Free Democratic Party are left to support the government coalition. And it no longer has a two-thirds majority in the Federal Assembly and the Senate.
    Some West German bourgeois newspapers have described the split of the West German government coalition as simply a power struggle between West German bourgeois parties. Their purpose in doing so is to cover up the real reason why the Adenauer Group is losing support. Everyone knows that the withdrawal of the "All-German Bloc" from the government coalition was because most members of the "All-German Bloc" disagreed with Adenauer's policy of rearming West Germany and joining a military bloc. The recent break between the Free Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Union was also caused by their serious differences on major policy issues such as West German rearmament, participation in military blocs, and relations with socialist countries.
    Adenauer has always advocated the deceptive argument that only by following the US war policy and stepping up rearmament can Germany achieve national rejuvenation and security; accepting the Paris Accords and joining the North Atlantic Group can lead to German reunification. It cannot be said that this argument has not played a deceptive role among some people in West Germany. However, as the Western proverb says, "A lie has no legs." Facts have exposed Adenauer's deception. Last year's Geneva conference of heads of state of the four powers determined that the German question should be resolved in accordance with European security and the interests of the German nation. The results of the subsequent four foreign ministers' conference clearly showed that German reunification can only be achieved through consultations by the German people themselves, based on the interests of European security. However, the Adenauer government has stubbornly refused the repeated proposals of the German Democratic Republic for negotiations, while stepping up the implementation of rearmament plans, leading West Germany onto the path of militarization. Every sober-minded person in West Germany can naturally see that this approach of the Adenauer government is contrary to the goal of reunifying Germany. More and more people understand that tying West Germany to the chariot of the North Atlantic Group will instead put West Germany at risk of being involved in an atomic war that would bring devastating blows to West Germany. Moreover, the Paris Accords stipulate that the occupying forces of the three Western powers will continue to be stationed in West Germany, which is a great irony to the so-called restoration of West German sovereignty. From the perspective of West Germany's economic interests, Adenauer's submission to the US war policy only benefited a few West German monopoly capitalists who are closely colluding with US monopoly groups, while harming the interests of the broad masses of the people and even some other bourgeoisie. The distorted development of the national economy's militarization and the heavy burden of taxes constitute serious weaknesses in West Germany's economic development. The adverse impact of implementing the US "embargo" policy on West Germany's export trade is also becoming increasingly apparent.
    On the other hand, the recent developments in the international situation have also had a significant impact on public opinion in West Germany. Due to the Soviet Union's active pursuit of a peaceful foreign policy, the international situation has eased to a considerable extent, and the idea of peaceful coexistence has taken root in people's hearts. The policy of expanding armaments and organizing military blocs has been increasingly despised. Some countries, such as Austria, Finland, and Sweden, have declared non-participation in military blocs as a principle of their foreign policy; in Northern Europe and many other Western European countries, neutralist sentiments are growing; some countries that have already been dragged into military blocs are also trying to reduce the heavy burden of military spending and avoid being involved in new wars. Numerous facts have proven that pursuing a peaceful and independent foreign policy is fully in line with the vital interests of these countries. Therefore, people from all walks of life in West Germany are even more convinced that they have no reason to take the dangerous "brink of war" path arranged for them by the US ruling group.
    It is these factors that have contributed to the unprecedented upsurge of anti-Adenauer Group policy sentiment in West Germany. The strong will of the broad masses of the people to change the policy naturally cannot but show its role in West German political life. It is easy to understand that when the Adenauer Group's policy is universally opposed in West Germany, some West German bourgeois party leaders, including the Free Democratic Party, have to consider the following question: facing next year's general election, is it better to continue to tie themselves to the Adenauer Group's hopeless war policy and be abandoned by the voters? Or is it better to break away from the Adenauer Group's political line as soon as possible and maintain their position in the future elections? Bourgeois political leaders like Dehler cannot remain indifferent to the fact that the Christian Democratic Union has lost more than three million votes in elections since the 1953 general election. About half a year ago, the leaders of the Free Democratic Party began to publicly criticize Adenauer's foreign policy. However, instead of reconciling the differences between it and other parties in the government coalition by revising the current policy, the Christian Democratic Union wanted to put pressure on its "allies," forcing them to continue to support its policy unconditionally, while conspiring to use the means of revising the electoral law to ensure its absolute rule in next year's general election, and to打击[strike] other parties, including the Free Democratic Party. This approach of the Adenauer Group could only intensify the contradiction between it and the Free Democratic Party, resulting in their open break.
    It can be seen that the split of the West German government coalition and the isolation of the Adenauer Group are a reflection of the serious bankruptcy of the Atlantic policy pursued by the Adenauer Group. This is why the American press, reflecting Washington's views, is particularly uneasy about the situation in West Germany. They lamented that Adenauer's political position was "shaken" and that US policy in West Germany "relied entirely on a fragile foundation." However, the Adenauer Group still does not take into account the West German people's desire for peace, unity, and independence, and continues to pursue the Atlantic policy. Therefore, it can be asserted that the Adenauer Group will definitely not be able to get rid of its current isolated situation, and the political crisis in West Germany will continue to deepen.

    阿登纳集团的孤立
    席林生
    北大西洋集团的分裂趋势最近成为西方资产阶级报刊议论的话题。在这方面，被美国统治集团看作是北大西洋集团支柱的西德国内近来发生的情况特别使华盛顿感到不安。在那里，局势的发展愈来愈有力地表明，美国“实力地位”政策推行者希望所系的阿登纳集团正日益失势和孤立。
    最近，一个值得注意的发展是，二月二十日在西德最重要的，工业最集中、人口最多的北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州的议会中，西德政府联盟第二大党自由民主党和反对党社会民主党一起推翻了基督教民主联盟的政府。结果是阿登纳集团一怒之下把自由民主党开除出政府联盟，造成西德政府联盟的公开破裂。接着，在三月初举行的巴登—瓦登堡州选举中，阿登纳党丧失了大量选票。
    西德政府联盟是在1953年由基督教民主联盟、自由民主党、“全德集团”和德意志党四个资产阶级政党组成的。这些党派代表着西德资产阶级不同的利益集团。它们凑在一起在联邦议院和参议院都占有着三分之二的多数的议席。阿登纳一向就是依靠这个资产阶级政党集团推行重新复活德国军国主义和使西德加入西方军事集团的政策。但是从去年起，这个右翼政党的联盟开始走上了分崩离析的道路。首先是“全德集团”内部发生分裂，结果是这个党派退出了政府联盟，动摇了政府联盟的基础。而最近自由民主党和基督教民主联盟的决裂，就更进一步削弱了政府联盟的地位。现在，政府联盟中只剩下基督教民主联盟和小小的德意志党以及一些自由民主党的脱党分子来撑持了。而它在联邦议院和参议院中都已经凑不够三分之二的多数。
    西德的一些资产阶级报刊把西德政府联盟的分裂说成单纯是由于西德资产阶级政党之间的争权夺利。它们这样做的目的，是想掩盖阿登纳集团众叛亲离的真正原因。大家知道，“全德集团”的退出政府联盟是由于“全德集团”大多数党员不同意追随阿登纳使西德重新武装和参加军事集团的政策。而自由民主党最近和基督教民主联盟的决裂，也是起因于它们在西德重新武装、参加军事集团和对社会主义国家关系这样一些重大政策问题上的严重分歧。
    阿登纳过去一直鼓吹这样一种骗人的论调：只有跟随美国的战争政策而加紧进行重新武装才能为德国带来民族复兴和安全；接受巴黎协定和参加北大西洋集团就可以导致德国的重新统一。不能说这种论调在西德某些人士中间没有起过欺骗的作用。但是，正如西方谚语所说的，“谎话活不长”。事实戳穿了阿登纳的欺骗。去年四国首脑日内瓦会议认定德国问题应当按照欧洲安全和德国民族的利益来解决。接着举行的四国外长会议的结果清楚地表明，德国的重新统一只能根据欧洲安全的利益，通过德国人民自己的协商来实现。可是，阿登纳政府一直顽固地拒绝德意志民主共和国所一再提出的进行谈判的建议，同时加紧推行重新武装的计划，使西德走上军国主义化的道路。西德每一个头脑清醒的人都自然看得出阿登纳政府的这种做法是和重新统一德国的目标背道而驰的。越来越多的人明白，把西德绑在北大西洋集团的战车上，反而使西德有被卷入一场会给西德招来毁灭性打击的原子战争的危险。而且巴黎协定规定西方三国的占领军将继续驻扎在西德，这对所谓西德恢复了主权的说法是一大讽刺。从西德的经济利益方面来看，阿登纳屈从美国的战争政策，只使少数同美国垄断集团紧密勾结在一起的西德垄断资本家得到了好处，而对于广大人民以至其他一些资产阶级的利益却造成损害。国民经济军事化的畸形发展和沉重的捐税负担，构成了西德经济发展中的严重弱点。而执行美国的“禁运”政策对西德出口贸易的不利影响也日益明显。
    另一方面，最近国际局势的发展，对于西德国内的舆论也发生着重大的影响。由于苏联奉行积极的和平外交政策，国际局势有了相当程度的缓和，和平共处的思想已经深入人心，扩充军备和组织军事集团的政策，受到了愈来愈多的人的唾弃。像奥地利、芬兰、瑞典等一些国家，都宣布以不参加军事集团作为它们外交政策的原则；在北欧和西欧其他许多国家中，中立主义的情绪正在日益增长；一些已经被拖进了军事集团的国家，也竭力设法减轻军费重压，并避免被卷入新的战争。许许多多事实已经证明，执行和平独立的外交政策是完全符合这些国家的切身利益的。因此，西德各阶层人民更加深信，他们没有理由要走美国统治集团给他们安排的危险的“战争边缘”道路。
    正是这样一些因素促成了西德国内反对阿登纳集团的政策的情绪空前高涨。而广大人民要求改变政策的强烈意志自然不能不在西德的政治生活中显示出它的作用来。这是很容易理解的，当阿登纳集团的政策在西德国内遭到普遍反对的时候，包括自由民主党在内的一些西德资产阶级政党领袖们都得考虑到这样一个问题：面临明年的大选，是继续把自己同阿登纳集团的毫无前途的战争政策绑在一起，而被选民所抛弃呢？还是趁早背离阿登纳集团的政治路线，而在未来的选举中保住自己的地位呢？像戴勒这样一些资产阶级政治领袖，对于基督教民主联盟自从1953年大选以来在选举中已丧失了三百多万选票的事实，自然不能无动于衷。大约半年以前，自由民主党的领袖开始公开批评阿登纳的外交政策。但是，基督教民主联盟却不是用修改现行政策的办法来调和它和政府联盟其他党派之间的分歧，而是要对它的“同盟者”施加压力，强迫它们无条件地继续支持它的政策，同时阴谋利用修改选举法的手段来保证自己在明年大选中获得绝对统治地位，而打击包括自由民主党在内的其他政党。阿登纳集团的这种做法当然只能使它和自由民主党之间的矛盾愈加增剧，结果终于造成了它们的公开决裂。
    由此可见，西德政府联盟的分裂和阿登纳集团的孤立是阿登纳集团奉行的大西洋政策遭到了严重破产的反映。这就是为什么反映华盛顿意见的美国报刊对于西德的局势特别感到不安的原故。它们懊丧地指出：阿登纳的政治地位“动摇了”，美国的政策在西德“完全依靠一个脆弱的基础”。但是阿登纳集团迄今仍然不把西德人民要求和平、统一和独立的愿望放在心里，而继续奉行着那个大西洋政策，因此可以断言，阿登纳集团肯定地无法摆脱它目前的孤立处境，西德的政治危机将会继续加深。
