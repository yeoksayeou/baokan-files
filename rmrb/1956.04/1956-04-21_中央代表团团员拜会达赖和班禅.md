Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 20th – All members of the Central Delegation paid a visit to the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni at the Norbulingka at 3 p.m. today.

The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni met with the members of the Central Delegation in a palace called "Honest Peace and Light." A huge portrait of Chairman Mao, draped with yellow hadas, hung on the front of the palace. Behind the palace was the Dalai Lama's scripture hall. The members of the delegation stepped forward one by one to present hadas to the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, who in turn presented hadas in return. When the Dalai Lama saw acquaintances he knew from the interior, he smiled and said in Chinese, "We are old acquaintances!"

The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni both gave speeches welcoming the arrival of the Central Delegation. The Dalai Lama said to all members of the delegation, "It is not easy for many representatives of ethnic minorities in our country to gather together today. Before liberation, it was impossible not only for brotherly ethnic groups to meet each other, but also to understand each other." The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni expressed their hope that representatives of the various ethnic groups could offer valuable suggestions for the work in Tibet during this visit.

The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni had intimate conversations with the members of the delegation.

    中央代表团团员拜会达赖和班禅
    新华社拉萨20日电  中央代表团全体团员在今天下午三时到罗布林卡，拜会了达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼。
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在一个被叫做“正直和平、光明”的宫殿里，同中央代表团的团员们见了面。宫殿的正面挂着披有黄色哈达的巨幅毛主席像，宫殿的后面便是达赖的经堂。代表团的团员一一上前向达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼献哈达，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼也还赠了哈达。当达赖喇嘛看到他在内地认识的熟人时，笑着用汉话说：“我们是老相识！”
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼先后致词，欢迎中央代表团的到来。达赖喇嘛对代表团全体团员说：“我国许多少数民族代表今天能够欢聚一堂，是很不容易的。解放前，不要说各兄弟民族互相见面不可能，就是互相了解也很少。”达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼希望各兄弟民族代表这次来到西藏，能够对西藏的工作提出宝贵的意见。
    达赖和班禅额尔德尼同代表团团员们亲密地进行了交谈。
