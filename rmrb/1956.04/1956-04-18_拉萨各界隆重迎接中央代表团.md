Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 17th: Today, the Lhasa plain was bathed in bright sunshine. In the western suburbs of Lhasa, the famous "City of Sunlight," more than 50,000 people lined the ten-li-long road, welcoming the arrival of the Central Delegation with the grandest of ceremonies. In Lhasa's Barkhor Street and on the avenue from Norbulingka to the Potala Palace, more than a dozen huge colorful arches adorned with palace lanterns and painted with golden dragons and patterns were dazzlingly decorated. The streets were filled with huge red banners welcoming the Central Delegation.

The Central Delegation's motorcade arrived in Lhasa's western suburbs at 1:00 PM. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni greeted the Central Delegation at the Yingguanting (Reception Pavilion), more than ten *li* away from the city. Also present to welcome them were: Zhang Guohua, Acting Secretary of the CPC Tibet Work Committee, Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary, Lieutenant General Tan Guansan of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Tibetan local government Kālons (officials) So Kon Wangqing Gelei, Do Gar Pengcuo Raojie, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Assistant Kālons Xia Su Jumo Ciren Dorje, Acting Kālons Ga Zhang Losang Renzeng, Acting Jikyo Khenpo Losang Sandan, Panchen Kanpo Lija Hall officials Zhan Dong Jijinmei, Lhamin Yixi Chuchen, Danlong Cairin Banjue, Yao Xi Gongbo Caidan, and Bangda Doje, Deputy Director of the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, among others.

In the courtyard of the Yingguanting, a large tent embroidered with colorful phoenixes and the Eight Immortals was set up, surrounded by golden yellow cloth curtains. Inside the largest golden-roofed tent in the center, were hung Buddha statues and brocade streamers symbolizing auspiciousness and good fortune. The road leading to this tent was also sprinkled with white powder in various patterns, according to the most solemn Tibetan welcoming ceremony. Here, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni presented *hada* to Chen Yi, head of the Central Delegation and Vice Premier of the State Council, and deputy heads Zhang Jingwu and Wang Feng. Chen Yi, Zhang Jingwu, and Wang Feng also reciprocated with *hada*. The deputy heads of the Central Delegation from various ethnic groups and the Tibetan members of the delegation presented *hada* to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni.

The welcoming ceremony of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni for the Central Delegation was held here. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni both delivered welcome speeches to the Central Delegation, and Chen Yi also delivered a reply speech at the meeting. Subsequently, officials of the Tibetan local government, representing the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, offered butter tea to the head and deputy heads of the Central Delegation and the members of the delegation, and also, according to the unique custom of the Tibetan people, offered ginseng fruit rice to express congratulations and happiness.

After the meeting, Chen Yi, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the members of the delegation walked out of the Yingguanting and, amid enthusiastic applause, rode in cars through the welcoming ranks of monks, lay officials of the Tibetan local government, the Panchen Kanpo Lija Hall Committee, and representatives of the Tibetan people from the Qamdo area. At this time, joyous drumbeats sounded from the ranks of hundreds of costumed Tibetan artists and cultural workers. Then, accompanied by the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, Chen Yi reviewed the honor guard of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan local army. The honor guard of the Tibetan local army wore the uniforms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for today's review. When the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni again accompanied Chen Yi into the welcoming arch, Tibetan Young Pioneers and 120 Tibetan, Hui, and Han youths presented flowers to Chen Yi, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and all members of the Central Delegation. At this time, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni returned to the Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple respectively by car.

In the specially set up large tent on the north square of Norbulingka, Head Chen Yi was once again warmly welcomed by representatives of Tibetan officials, Living Buddhas, and patriotic organizations. The entire Kālons of the Tibetan local government, the main officials of the Panchen Kanpo Lija Hall Committee, Sakya Dharma Kings, representatives of the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, Living Buddha Pacaila, Living Buddha Luodeng Xirao, Living Buddha Gama Cai, as well as Xuekang Tudeng Nyima, Deputy Director of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Liaison Association, and Yao Xi Zeren Zhuoma, Director of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation, all presented *hada* to Chen Yi, Zhang Jingwu, and Wang Feng, and offered butter tea and rice.

At 2:00 PM, people from all walks of life in Lhasa held a welcoming ceremony for the Central Delegation in the square. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Director of the Tibet Reception Committee for Welcoming the Central Delegation, delivered a welcome speech at the meeting, saying: "Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the great leader Chairman Mao of all ethnic groups, remarkable achievements have been made in all aspects of work. Based on this, the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been decided, which will further advance the work in the Tibetan area. At this time, the Central Government sent a delegation to congratulate us, which shows that the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao's care and concern for the Tibetan people are meticulous and all-encompassing. The arrival of the Central Delegation will definitely provide comprehensive guidance and assistance for us to successfully convene the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region and for the future development of Tibet's politics, economy, and culture."

Chen Yi also spoke at this meeting. He extended cordial greetings on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong to the people present and, through them, to the people of all strata in the Tibetan region.

After the meeting, Chen Yi led the members of the Central Delegation in open cars through the welcoming ranks, entering the urban area. As they arrived there, the excited welcoming crowd burst into cheers and enthusiastic applause, and some people even threw colored confetti onto the delegation's cars. Representatives of the three major monasteries in Lhasa and thousands of Lamas, holding Tibetan incense, peach branches, and *hada*, welcomed the Central Delegation.

Today, the vast majority of Lhasa citizens and farmers and herdsmen from the surrounding villages, supporting the old and leading the young, came to welcome the delegation. Their ranks stretched from the western end of the Potala Palace to the delegation's residence.
