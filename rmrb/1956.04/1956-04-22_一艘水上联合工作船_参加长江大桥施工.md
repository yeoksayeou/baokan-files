    A Combined Floating Work Platform
    Joins Yangtze River Bridge Construction
    A newly assembled combined floating work platform sailed to the construction site of the No. 3 pier of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge on the 19th to participate in the construction.
    This type of combined floating work platform can simultaneously perform three tasks: lifting, concrete mixing, and steel sheet pile extraction. It is particularly useful for the pier construction, which is currently underway. The combined floating work platform was assembled by mechanical workers at the bridge construction site based on the suggestions of Soviet experts. Its structure is very simple: a small automatic concrete factory and a tall steel sheet pile extractor are installed on two conjoined large iron barges; a crane is mounted on top of the steel sheet pile extractor.

    一艘水上联合工作船
    参加长江大桥施工
    一艘新拼装起来的水上联合工作船，十九日开往武汉长江大桥三号桥墩工地参加施工。
    这种水上联合工作船可以同时进行起重，拌合混凝土和拔钢板桩三种工作，对目前正在紧张施工中的桥墩工程特别有用。水上联合工作船是根据苏联专家的建议、由大桥工地上的机械工人拼装起来的。它的构造很简单，在两艘拼联的大铁驳船上，安装着一台小型的自动混凝土工厂、一架高大的拔钢板桩机；在拔钢板桩机顶上有一台起重吊机。（据新华社讯）
