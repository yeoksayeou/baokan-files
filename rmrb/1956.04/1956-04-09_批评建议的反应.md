      Improving the Quality of Newsprint
    A letter from the "Dazhong Daily" in Shandong: On the "Reader's Letters" page of February 5th, the "Anhui Daily's" opinion on the poor quality of domestic roll paper was published, and we deeply sympathize with it. The quality of the roll paper produced by the Tianjin Paper Mill used by our newspaper is also very poor. This kind of paper is uneven in thickness, the surface is rough and lackluster, the texture is hard and does not easily absorb ink, if the pressure is too light the printing is unclear, if the pressure is too heavy the newspaper appears uneven, and the printed photos are blurry. This kind of paper has too much paper fluff, which flies everywhere when printing newspapers, easily damaging the machine and clogging the stereotype. Therefore, the machine must be stopped and the stereotype brushed every three to five thousand copies, which prolongs the publication time.
    We raised these issues with the Tianjin Paper Mill and the Shanghai Paper Supply Station many times as early as last year, but so far the quality of the paper has not improved much. We hope that the leading authorities will pay attention to this issue and help the paper mills improve the quality of their products.

    A letter from the Jiaxing Municipal Joint State-Private Utilization Paper Mill in Zhejiang: The criticism of the "Anhui Daily" published on the "Reader's Letters" page regarding the poor quality of our mill's newsprint is correct. Our mill uses a single-cylinder paper machine to produce paper, which must be calendered, so the density is high and the paper is thin. At the same time, roll paper and flat paper are made on the same machine, which affects the quality of the roll paper in order to meet the requirements of the flat paper. To solve these problems, we have obtained the consent of the relevant authorities to specialize in the production of heavier-weight flat paper from the second quarter onwards, and adjust the ratio of raw materials to meet the requirements of users.

    A letter from Li Chongmin, Director of the Yunfeng Paper Mill in Kunming, Yunnan: We accept the criticism from readers Liu Zengyu and Lin Zhuping. Because we do not pay enough attention to product quality in our thinking, the problem of poor paper quality has not been resolved for a long time. Because we are not active enough in the trial production of new products, we have not been able to supply roll newsprint to the Yunnan Daily. Now, under the supervision of the higher party committee and the Provincial Department of Industry, we have begun to improve our work, and we will begin supplying roll newsprint in March, and we are determined to work hard to improve the quality of the paper.

    A letter from Luo Chang and others, Directors of the Qiqihar Paper Mill: The criticism on the "Reader's Letters" page on February 5th regarding the poor quality of our mill's products and our failure to deliver goods according to the contract is completely correct. The reason why these problems have not been solved for a long time is mainly because the leaders of our mill have serious right-leaning conservative ideas, and have not tapped the potential in production or brought into play the enthusiasm of the workers. We have now taken concrete measures to correct the shortcomings in our past work and improve our future work.

    批评建议的反应
      提高新闻纸的质量
    山东“大众日报”社来信：二月五日，“读者来信专页”上发表了安徽日报对国产卷筒纸质量不好的意见，我们深有同感。我们报社用的天津造纸厂出产的卷筒纸质量也很不好。这种纸厚薄不匀，纸面粗糙无光，质硬不易吸墨，压力轻了印不清楚，压力重了报纸显得凸凹不平，印出的照片模糊不清。这种纸纸毛太多，在印刷报纸的时候，纸毛到处飞扬，容易损坏机器，糊塞铅版，因此每印三、五千份报纸就要停机刷铅版一次，这就拖长了出版时间。
    对于这些问题，早在去年我们就向天津造纸厂和上海纸张供应站多次提出意见，但是至今纸张质量改进不大。我们希望领导机关重视这个问题，帮助各造纸厂提高产品质量。

    浙江嘉兴市公私合营利用造纸厂来信：“读者来信专页”上发表了安徽日报对我厂新闻纸质量不好的批评是正确的。我厂用的是单烘缸造纸机，生产出来的纸必须经过轧光，因此紧度高，纸张薄；同时卷筒纸和平版纸用同一机器制造，为了适应平版纸的要求，就影响到卷筒纸的质量。为了解决这些问题，我们已经取得有关机关的同意，从第二季度起专门制造定量较重的平版纸，调整原料的配比，使它符合用户的要求。

    云南昆明市云丰造纸厂厂长李崇民来信：我们接受读者刘增羽、林烛平的批评。由于我们在思想上对产品质量不重视，因而纸张质量低劣的问题长期不能解决。由于我们对试制新产品的工作不够积极，因而一直不能给云南日报供应卷筒新闻纸。现在我们在上级党委和省工业厅的督促下，已经着手改进工作，在三月份开始供应卷筒新闻纸，并且决心努力提高纸张质量。

    齐齐哈尔造纸厂厂长罗昶等来信：二月五日“读者来信专页”上对我厂产品质量不好和不能按合同交货的批评，是完全正确的。这些问题之所以长期没有解决，主要是因为我厂领导人员有着严重的右倾保守思想，没有发掘生产中的潜力和发挥职工群众的积极性。我们现在已经采取具体措施，来纠正过去工作中的缺点，改进今后的工作。
