Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 17th: Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo said at a press conference today that Indonesia will oppose nuclear weapons testing, especially when such tests are located close to Indonesia itself, because it may endanger people's lives.

Sastroamidjojo pointed out that the Asian-African Conference had condemned nuclear weapons and thermonuclear weapons explosion tests. Atomic energy should be used for peaceful purposes and not for war.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 17th: According to a Colombo dispatch from the Indian newspaper, the new Prime Minister of Ceylon, Bandaranaike, in a telegram to Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, guaranteed his support for the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference.

This telegram was in response to Sastroamidjojo's recent telegram requesting all countries participating in the Asian-African Conference to celebrate the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference on April 18th.

Bandaranaike said in his reply that due to his short time in office, he was unable to organize celebrations. However, he recognized that the Bandung Conference helped promote understanding and peace in the world. He fully agreed with the resolutions made at the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, Washington: Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike said: Ceylon will adopt a neutral policy, and the British troops stationed in Ceylon must leave.

His remarks were published in the April 16th issue of "U.S. News & World Report." He told reporters from the magazine that Ceylon "hopes to become the Switzerland of Asia," "which means adopting a neutral policy, not forming alliances with any major power groups, etc."

He said: Maintaining British military bases in Ceylon "is not at all in line with our sovereignty as a country." "It does not fit my idea of turning Ceylon into the Switzerland of Asia. Moreover, this would make us one of the first targets in the event of war."

He also said: Ceylon will become a republic. But it has not yet been decided whether to withdraw from the British Commonwealth.

Bandaranaike said: He believes that Ceylon should establish diplomatic relations with China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democracies of Eastern Europe. He said, "I think the most important thing to do is to eliminate trade barriers. Secondly, other contacts between the East and the West must be increased." He said he planned to make a visit around the world and would welcome Soviet leaders to visit Ceylon.

Bandaranaike said: If the Soviet Union is willing to provide economic assistance, he would welcome it and allow Soviet technicians to come to Ceylon to help develop Ceylon's economy. When the magazine's reporter asked him if he was willing to accept American aid, he said he would "study that issue very carefully...to understand what conditions might be attached." When the reporter asked if this aid must be "without any strings attached," he replied: "Yes."

United Nations Asian-African Group of Countries' Representatives Write to the Security Council Pointing Out

The Current Situation in Algeria is a Threat to Peace and Security

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, New York: Representatives of sixteen countries in the Asian-African Group at the United Nations jointly wrote a letter to the United Nations Security Council on April 16th, emphasizing that the current situation in Algeria is a threat to peace and security.

The letter recalled that last year's Asian-African Bandung Conference declared its support for Algeria's right to self-determination and independence. The letter said that despite repeated appeals from all parties, "the French government has refused to negotiate with representatives of the Algerian people to meet their legitimate demands. On the contrary, the French government has intensified its use of force to implement its suppression policy." The letter said that as a result of this policy, thousands of people have been killed or injured in Algeria, and casualties continue to increase. The French government is deploying more and more troops in Algeria. The whole of Algeria is under martial law.

The letter to the Security Council said that existing materials show that the situation in Algeria is deteriorating and may endanger peace and security in the region. The letter said: "We believe that the United Nations can no longer remain indifferent to the situation in Algeria, because the situation there is a threat to peace and security, and violates the basic right to self-determination and blatantly violates other basic human rights.

Arab League Political Committee

Opposes Western Countries Sending Troops to the Borders of Arab Countries

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, Tass, Beirut, 16th: Lebanese Foreign Minister Salim Lahoud, who returned from Cairo a few days ago, told reporters that the Arab League Political Committee had passed a resolution firmly opposing any attempt by Western countries to send armed forces to the borders of Arab countries.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson Admits

The Bandung Conference Showed New Trends in Asia and Africa

According to Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, New York: Former U.S. Democratic government's Secretary of State Acheson published an article in the "New York Times Magazine," believing that the U.S. and British policy of organizing military blocs in the Middle East and Southeast Asia is "more harmful than beneficial." Acheson said that Dulles insisted on establishing military treaties from North Africa through the Middle East and India to Indonesia. However, these military treaties cobbled together by the United States and Britain "did not produce strength and unity, but division and weakness." Acheson said, "Bandung (Conference) extremely vividly showed a new trend in this middle region that is increasingly hoping to be its own master." He called on American policymakers to "recognize that concluding military treaties in the middle region is more harmful than beneficial."

U.S. Newspapers Worry About the Growth of Turkish Neutralism

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, Washington: The Washington evening newspaper "Star" published a navigation by Constantine Brown on April 10th, entitled: "The Friendship Between the United States and Turkey is Tested, Ankara's Suspicion of American Goodwill Has Aroused a Strong Wave of Neutralism."

Brown said: "Suspicion of the goodwill of the Washington government has penetrated into the hearts of Turkish government officials and those who painfully realize the bankruptcy crisis facing their own country. Talk about neutralism can be heard not only among some government officials, but also from newspapers and among people drinking sweet Turkish coffee in cafes."

Brown's navigation explained that Turkish public opinion is strongly demanding that Turkey accept aid from its eastern neighbor. The author of the navigation uneasily talked about Turkey's historical friendship with the Soviet Union. He said that due to Turkey's current difficulties, the United States "has a fifty percent chance" of losing this "most loyal" friend in the Middle East.

    亚非会议决议的影响在日益扩大
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说
    印度尼西亚反对核子武器试验
    新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约今天在记者招待会上说，印度尼西亚将反对核子武器试验，特别当这种试验的地点是靠近印度尼西亚本身的时候，因为它可能危害人民的生命。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约指出，亚非会议曾经谴责核子武器和热核子武器的爆炸试验。原子能应当用于和平的目的而不应当用于战争。
    班达拉奈克致电沙斯特罗阿米佐约
    保证支持亚非会议的决议
    新华社新德里17日电　据印度报业托辣斯科伦坡消息，锡兰新总理班达拉奈克在拍给印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约的一封电报中，保证他支持亚非会议的各项决议。
    这封电报是答复沙斯特罗阿米佐约最近要求所有参加亚非会议的国家都在四月十八日庆祝亚非会议一周年纪念日的电报的。
    班达拉奈克在他的复电中说，由于他任职以后时间很短促，他不能够组织庆祝事宜。然而，他认识到，万隆会议有助于促进世界上的谅解和和平。他完全赞成这个会议所作出的各项决议。
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克说：锡兰将采取中立政策，英国驻锡兰的军队必须离开。
    他的这番话发表在四月十六日的“美国新闻与世界报道”上。他对这个杂志的记者发表谈话说：锡兰“希望能够成为亚洲的瑞士”，“这就意味着要采取中立政策，不同任何大国集团结成联盟等等”。
    他说：在锡兰保持英国的军事基地“是一点也不符合我们作为一个国家的主权的”。“这是不合我的把锡兰变成亚洲的瑞士的想法的。而且这将使我们成为战争中的第一批目标之一，如果爆发战争的话。”
    他还说：锡兰将成为一个共和国。但还没有决定是否要退出英联邦。
    班达拉奈克说：他认为锡兰应当同中国、苏联和东欧各人民民主国家建立外交关系。他说：“我想必须要做的最重要的事情就是要取消贸易壁垒。其次，东方和西方在其他方面的接触必须增加。”他说他想到世界各地去进行一次访问，同时将欢迎苏联领袖访问锡兰。
    班达拉奈克说：如果苏联愿意给予经济援助的话，他将表示欢迎，并且让苏联的技术人员到锡兰来帮助发展锡兰的经济。这个杂志的记者问他是否愿意接受美国的援助，他说他“还要非常仔细地研究那个问题……以了解可能会附有什么条件。”记者问到这种援助是不是必须“没有任何附带条件”，他回答说：“是的。”
    联合国亚非集团国家代表致函安理会指出
    阿尔及利亚目前局势是对和平和安全的威胁
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：在联合国的亚非集团十六个国家的代表在四月十六日联名写给联合国安全理事会一封信，信里强调指出，阿尔及利亚目前的局势是对和平和安全的威胁。
    这封信追述去年亚非国家万隆会议宣布支持阿尔及利亚取得自决和独立的权利。信中说，尽管有各方面的一再呼吁，“法国政府却拒绝同阿尔及利亚人民的代表进行谈判以满足他们的合法要求。相反的，法国政府加紧使用武力来执行它的镇压政策。”这封信说，由于这种政策的结果，在阿尔及利亚已经有数千人被杀死或者受伤，而且伤亡在继续增加中。法国政府正在阿尔及利亚部署越来越多的军队。整个阿尔及利亚都处在戒严状态中。
    给安理会的信说，现有的材料表明，阿尔及利亚局势正在恶化，而且可能危及那个地区的和平和安全。信里说：“我们认为，联合国不能再对阿尔及利亚的局势漠不关心，因为那里的局势是对和平和安全的威胁，而且侵犯了基本自决权和彰明昭著地违反了其他基本人权。

    前美国国务卿艾奇逊承认
    万隆会议表明了亚非新趋向
    据新华社17日讯　纽约消息：美国前民主党政府时代的国务卿艾奇逊在“纽约时报杂志”上发表一篇文章，认为美国和英国在中东和东南亚组织军事集团的政策是“害多利少的”。艾奇逊说，杜勒斯坚持从北非经过中东和印度到印度尼西亚这一地区成立军事条约。但是，美国和英国拼凑的这些军事条约“并没有产生力量和团结，而是产生了分裂和软弱。”艾奇逊说，“万隆（会议）极其生动地表明这个中间地区发生了一种日益希望作自己的主人”的新趋向。他要求美国的决策人“认识在中间地区缔结军事条约害多利少”。
    美报担心土耳其中立主义增长
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：华盛顿晚报“明星报”在四月十日发表了康斯坦丁·布朗的一篇航讯，题目是：“美国同土耳其的友谊受到考验，安卡拉对于美国的善意的怀疑激起了强烈的中立主义浪潮”。
    布朗说：“对于华盛顿政府的善意的怀疑，已经深入到土耳其政府官员和痛苦地了解到他们自己国家所面临的破产危机的人们的心中。关于中立主义的谈话，不仅可以在某些政府人士中听到，也可以从报纸和在咖啡馆中喝着甜甜的土耳其咖啡的人们中间听到了。”
    布朗的航讯说明，土耳其的舆论正在强烈地要求土耳其接受它的东邻的援助。航讯的作者不安地谈到土耳其对苏联的历史友谊。他说，由于土耳其目前的困难，美国“有一半的可能”失去它在中东的这个“最忠诚的”朋友。
