On the 28th, Chen Yi, head of the Central Delegation, along with deputy heads Zhang Jingwu and Wang Feng, delegation secretary-general and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League Luo Yi, and deputy head of the first sub-delegation of the delegation and Vice Minister of Education Lin Han Da, joyfully spent the day with hundreds of Tibetan children at Lhasa Primary School.

When Chen Yi and others arrived at Lhasa Primary School, the children, dressed like flowers, rushed to them and presented them with flowers. Subsequently, the school's principal, the Living Buddha Chijiang, and vice-principal, Dorje Tseten, led Chen Yi and others to visit the new classrooms that had been completed last year. They entered the sixth-grade classroom, where students practicing Tibetan immediately applauded in welcome. Chen Yi and others looked through the students' Tibetan textbooks and workbooks, praising their excellent Tibetan writing. As they were leaving the classroom, Chen Yi said to the children kindly, "I represent Chairman Mao in sending you my greetings. You are all the future masters of the country." The children were delighted and applauded enthusiastically. Afterwards, Chen Yi and others visited the dormitories of the boarding students at the primary school.

The guests arrived at a grove of white poplars and willows called "Duoqiang Linka" on the west side of the classroom building. This Linka was a gift from the Dalai Lama to the school. The young hosts arranged a very wonderful open-air song and dance performance here.

Before the program began, the school children presented gifts to the Central Delegation. More than a dozen boys and girls holding gifts presented the gifts to the guests. These included a meticulously crafted model of Tiananmen Square, a watercolor painting of the Potala Palace, and a Tibetan letter they entrusted to the Central Delegation to be forwarded to Chairman Mao.

One song and dance program followed another. The young actors performed the "Hada Offering Dance" and the "Welcome Dance" with great care for the guests. The performers were all boys and girls under the age of ten. They danced and sang at the same time. The dance was warmly praised by the guests.

After the chorus program, two young announcers appeared in front of the guests and reported: "The program is over. We wish the uncles and aunts of the Central Delegation good health." At this time, Chen Yi and others repeatedly picked up the young actors who were crowded around them, kissed them warmly, and gave each of them a commemorative badge engraved with Chairman Mao's portrait and the Tiananmen pattern. Chen Yi said to the Living Buddha Chijiang standing beside them: "I have seen the glorious future of the Tibetan people. I wish the children of Tibet happiness!"

When the guests said goodbye, hundreds of children once again rushed to the guests, jumping and vying to shake hands with them, calling out to the guests in Tibetan and Chinese, "噶里沛!" (walk slowly) "Goodbye!"

    陈毅副总理在拉萨小学
    二十八日，中央代表团团长陈毅和副团长张经武、汪锋以及代表团秘书长、青年团中央书记处书记罗毅和代表团第一分团副团长、教育部副部长林汉达和拉萨小学的几百名藏族儿童一起欢乐地度过了一天。
    当陈毅等人到达拉萨小学的时候，穿戴得如同花朵般的儿童们涌到他们面前，向他们献花。随后，这个小学的校长赤江活佛、副校长多杰才旦引导陈毅等人参观了去年才修成的新教室。他们走进了六年级的教室，正在练习藏文的学生立刻鼓掌欢迎。陈毅等人翻看了学生们的藏文课本和练习本，夸奖他们藏文写得很好。在离开教室的时候，陈毅向儿童们亲切地说：“代表毛主席问你们好，你们都是国家未来的主人翁。”孩子们听了都高兴的热烈鼓起掌来。接着，陈毅等参观了这所小学住宿生的寝室。
    客人们来到了教室西侧名叫“多强林卡”的一片白杨和柳树林里。这个林卡是达赖喇嘛赠送给学校的。小主人们在这里安排了一个非常精采的露天歌舞会。
    在节目开始前，学校的儿童向中央代表团献礼，十多个抱着礼品的男女小孩把礼品献给客人们。这里面有他们精心制造的天安门模型，布达拉宫水彩画，以及他们委托中央代表团转给毛主席的藏文信。
    歌舞节目一个接着一个。小演员们尽心地为客人们表演了“献哈达舞”和 “欢迎舞”，演出者都是不到十岁的男女小孩。他们一边舞蹈，一边歌唱。这个舞蹈受到了客人们的热烈称赞。
    在合唱节目结束后，两个小报幕员出现在客人们的面前报告说：“节目演完了，祝中央代表团的叔叔和阿姨的身体健康。”这时，陈毅等人一次又一次地抱起了拥挤在他们身旁的小演员，热烈地亲他们，还给他们每人送了一个镌有毛主席像和天安门图案的纪念章，陈毅向站在他们身旁的赤江活佛说：“我看到了西藏人民的光辉前途，我祝西藏的儿童幸福！”
    客人们告辞的时候，几百个儿童再一次涌到客人们面前，跳跃着，争着和客人们握手，用藏话和汉话向客人们呼叫着“噶里沛！”（慢慢走）“再见！”
