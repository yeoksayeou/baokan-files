    Two Methods for Solving the Shortage of Draft Animals
    Jian Hong
    This year, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are generally demanding deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, expanding the area of multiple cropping, and using more new-style agricultural tools, requiring more draft animals than in previous years. However, some agricultural production cooperatives have experienced the death and weakening of draft animals due to improper handling of livestock joining the cooperative and poor feeding management, resulting in a decrease in the number of draft animals. Furthermore, some cooperatives only want large, strong draft animals and reject small, weak but actually usable draft animals, which has further exacerbated the problem of draft animal shortage. Currently, there are two very abnormal phenomena in the draft animal market in many regions: on the one hand, large and strong cattle are in short supply; on the other hand, there are too many small and weak cattle that no one wants. Some cooperatives, unable to buy strong cattle in the local market, spend a lot of money sending people to blindly buy strong cattle everywhere. Because everyone is unwilling to take small and weak cattle, and everyone wants large and strong cattle, the people sent to buy cattle elsewhere also return empty-handed. In this situation, some rural workers have developed a regressive mindset. Some workers in Yangjiang County, Guangdong, unable to buy large cattle by any means, plan to convert some paddy fields into dry land or reduce the number of plowing and harrowing operations. Obviously, this passive approach is detrimental to production.
    The fundamental solution to the problem of draft animal shortage is to vigorously breed livestock, but this is a long-term matter and cannot solve the current problem. So what should be done? Currently, agricultural cooperatives have two methods for solving the problem of draft animals. One is, as mentioned above, to pin their hopes on buying large livestock, neglecting the care and utilization of the existing weak and small draft animals in the cooperative. This approach cannot truly solve the current shortage of draft animals. The other is to solve the current shortage of draft animals by reasonably utilizing existing draft animals in the spirit of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily. Some cooperatives, by finding solutions in accordance with this spirit, have fully utilized the potential of existing draft animals, basically meeting the cooperative's needs for draft animals. Experience has shown that the most effective way to solve the problem of draft animals at present is to strengthen the management of existing livestock of all kinds, correctly handle the issue of draft animals joining the cooperative, care for and utilize weak and small draft animals, actively tap the potential of local and cooperative draft animals, and planfully regulate surpluses and deficits. When tapping the potential of draft animals within the cooperative, cooperatives should especially pay attention to fully utilizing the animal power that can be utilized. For example, weak livestock can have their farming ability improved as long as feeding and management are strengthened; some larger young livestock, although currently unable to plow, can also be used to do some light work. It is completely wrong for some cooperatives to neglect the role of small donkeys in farming. The five cooperatives in Dongcun, Hailong County, Jilin, are solving the problem of draft animal shortage by tapping these potentials. These cooperatives have strengthened the feeding management of draft animals, feeding weak livestock in single stalls, preparing to fatten up this part of the livestock as much as possible so that they can bear a part of the cultivated land in the spring plowing; at the same time, they have found five donkeys and some usable two-year-old foals and scattered cattle, preparing to let these small draft animals roll stones and do odd jobs during sowing, extracting strong animal power to open up wasteland.
    After tapping the potential of draft animals within the cooperative, if there is still a shortage of animal power, the adjustment of draft animals between cooperatives and between regions (including buying and selling and the customary rental by farmers) should be organized under leadership. Jiangxi Province originally claimed to be short of draft cattle everywhere, but after careful understanding, this problem can be completely solved as long as the adjustment work is done throughout the province. In various places, there are great differences in animal power between counties and counties, townships and townships, and cooperatives and cooperatives. In Huchao Township, Dagou District, Yangjiang County, Guangdong, each cow has to bear more than 31 mu of paddy fields, while in Huadong Township in the same district, each draft cattle only bears an average of 14 mu. This district originally reported a shortage of 340 draft cattle, but after adjustment between townships and townships, and cooperatives and cooperatives, the shortage was only 100. In this way, because the amount of shortage has been greatly reduced, it is easier to purchase 100 draft cattle from areas with more draft cattle. The party and government leading organs in Wenjiang Special District, Sichuan, have deeply grasped the specific situations such as the early and late seasons of agricultural activities in various regions, the amount of cattle power, and the tightness of the need for draft cattle, and organized various regions and cooperatives to carry out large-scale draft animal adjustments within the entire special district through mutual consultation in accordance with the principles of common development of production and mutual benefit. In this way, not only has the current production needs been basically met, but also, because the potential of local and cooperative draft animals has been well tapped, many cooperatives have saved a large amount of money for purchasing draft animals.
    Of course, while correctly solving the problem of animal power shortage, the role of the draft animal market cannot be ignored. Last winter, the supply and marketing departments in Sichuan Province conducted universal training for the trading personnel in the draft animal markets and draft animal trading service centers in various places, and established market management systems and trading regulations, which gave great help to agricultural cooperatives in the proper trading of draft cattle. Some areas have organized local cattle dealers to transport draft cattle to the producing areas in a planned way, which has also played a great role in adjusting the surplus and shortage of draft cattle, and has kept cattle prices stable. These correct practices are all worth promoting.

    解决耕畜不足问题的两种办法
    剑虹
    今年各地农业合作社普遍要求深耕细作、扩大复种面积和更多地使用新式农具，需要的耕畜比往年多了。但是有些农业生产合作社由于对牲畜入社问题处理不当和饲养管理不好，发生了耕畜死亡和瘦弱的现象，耕畜数量有些减少。还有一些合作社只要大的、壮的耕畜，不要小的、弱的实际上可用的耕畜，这样就使耕畜不足的问题更加严重了。目前，不少地区耕畜市场上出现了两种很不正常的现象：一方面大牛、壮牛供不应求；一方面小牛、弱牛多得没人要。有些合作社因为在当地市场上买不到壮牛，便花费很多钱派人四出盲目购买壮牛。因为大家都不愿要小牛、弱牛，都想要大牛、壮牛，结果派到别处买牛的人也落了空。在这种情况下，有些农村工作人员便产生了退一步的想法。广东阳江县有些工作人员，因为想各种办法买不到大牛，便打算把一部分水田改为旱田，或是想减少犁耙次数。显然，这种消极的做法，是对生产不利的。
    解决耕畜不足问题的根本办法，是大力繁殖牲畜，但是，这是长远的事情，不能解决当前的问题。那末应该怎样办呢？目前农业合作社有两种解决耕畜问题的办法。一种是像上面说的把希望寄托在购买大牲口上面，对社里现有的弱小耕畜不爱护，也不好好利用。这种做法是不能真正解决当前耕畜不足问题的。另一种是本着勤俭办社的精神，合理利用现有耕畜来解决当前的耕畜不足问题。有些合作社由于按照这一精神去想办法，充分发挥了现有耕畜的潜力，基本上满足了社里对耕畜的需要。经验证明，现在解决耕畜问题的最有效办法是：加强对现有各种牲畜的管理，正确处理耕畜入社问题，爱护和利用弱小耕畜，积极挖掘本地、本社的耕畜潜力和有计划地调剂余缺。合作社在挖掘社内耕畜潜力的时候，应该特别重视充分利用可能利用的畜力。如瘦弱的牲口，只要加强饲养管理，就可以提高它们的耕作能力；有一些较大的幼畜，虽然目前还不能耕作，但是也可以利用它们做一点轻活。有些合作社忽视小驴在耕作方面的作用，是十分错误的。吉林海龙县东村有五个合作社，就是从挖掘这些潜力来解决耕畜不足问题的。这几个社已经加强了对耕畜的饲养管理，把瘦弱的牲口单槽喂养，准备尽可能把这部分牲口喂壮一点，使它们在春耕中能担负一部分耕地；同时又找出了五头毛驴和一部分能使用的二岁子马和散牛，准备在播种的时候，让这些小耕畜轧辊子、做零活，抽出强壮畜力去开荒。
    在挖掘了本社耕畜潜力之后，如果仍然感到畜力不足，就应该有领导地组织合作社之间、地区之间的耕畜调剂（包括买卖和农民习惯上的租借）。江西省原来到处嚷缺耕牛，但是经过仔细了解后，只要做好全省范围的调剂工作，就可以完全解决这个问题。各地在县和县，乡和乡，社和社之间，畜力都有很大的差别。广东阳江县大沟区的笏朝乡每头牛要负担三十一亩多稻田，同一个区的华洞乡，平均每头耕牛只负担十四亩，这个区原报缺三百四十头耕牛，后来通过乡和乡，社和社之间的调剂，只缺一百头了。这样，因为缺的数量大大减少了，从耕畜较多的地区购买一百头耕牛，就比较容易了。四川温江专区的党政领导机关，深入地掌握了各地区的农事活动季节早迟，牛力多少和需要耕牛松紧等具体情况，组织各地区、各社按照共同发展生产和互利的原则，通过相互协商的办法，在全专区内展开大规模耕畜调剂。这样，不仅基本上满足了当前生产上的需要，而且由于很好地挖了本地本社的耕畜潜力，许多合作社都节省了很大一笔购买耕畜的资金。
    当然，在正确解决畜力不足问题的时候，也不能忽视耕畜市场的作用。去冬，四川省的供销部门就对各地耕畜市场和耕畜交易服务所的交易人员，普遍进行了训练，并且订立了市场管理制度和交易规章，这样在耕牛的正当交易方面，给了农业合作社很大帮助。有些地区把当地的牛贩组织起来，有计划地到产区贩运耕牛，在调剂耕牛的余缺方面也起了很大的作用，而且使牛价一直保持平稳。这些正确的做法，都是值得提倡的。
