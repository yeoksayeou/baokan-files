Engineers Wu Minfu and technicians Xin Qiufu and Jiang Bingtao, among others, from the Northwest Engineering Bureau's First Engineering Company recently proposed using bamboo-reinforced concrete formwork to replace wooden formwork for prefabricating large roof panels. This method has now been adopted by the First Engineering Company's processing plant.

In the past, wooden formwork was used to prefabricate large roof panels. Each time a large roof panel was prefabricated, the formwork had to be assembled and disassembled, wasting a lot of manpower. At the same time, the damage rate of wooden formwork was high, and the cost was very high. Bamboo-reinforced concrete formwork is durable and can be reused many times. At the same time, this kind of formwork is prefabricated and can be cured indoors or outdoors.

    用竹筋混凝土模板代替木模板
    西北工程管理局第一工程公司工程师吴民孚和技术员忻球福、蒋秉涛等，最近提出用竹筋混凝土模板代替木模板来预制大型屋面板的建议，现在这个办法已经在第一工程公司加工总厂采用。
    过去预制大型屋面板都是用木模板，每次预制一块大型屋面板，都要装一次拆一次，浪费人力很多，同时木模板的损坏率大，成本很高。竹筋混凝土模板经久耐用，能重复使用很多次。同时，这种模板是装配式的，可以在室内养护，也可以在露天养护。
