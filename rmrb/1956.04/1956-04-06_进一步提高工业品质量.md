The Highest Record of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant

    The qualified rate of pig iron produced by Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant in the first quarter reached 99.45%, creating the highest quarterly pig iron quality record since the plant was built.
    In the past, the quality of pig iron in this factory was very poor and was often criticized by iron-using units. This year, the factory has formulated measures to improve the quality of pig iron. The ironmaking workers earnestly promoted the advanced ironmaking experience of the Soviet Union, such as rapid combustion and raw material management, and effectively implemented the six suggestions of Soviet experts on improving the quality of pig iron, so that the quality of pig iron improved month by month. The qualified rate of pig iron produced from March 1st to 29th reached 99.81%.

Organize Technicians to Solve Key Problems

    In order to ensure that the quality of the gauze meets the new quality standards, the Tangshan Joint State-Private Huaxin Textile Factory organized technicians to go deep into the work site in early March. The technicians analyzed the workers' operations and products, and put forward various key technical problems that affected product quality. Then, the technicians formulated specific measures to ensure that they would work with the workers in the first half of the year to promote the seven advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and brother factories, and summarize the operating experience of the workers in the factory to improve product quality.

The Quality of More Than 300 Products in Tianjin Improved Compared with Last Year

    In the first quarter, the quality of more than 300 products from local industrial factories in Tianjin improved compared with last year. Many varieties of colored cloth and printed cloth produced by various factories of the Tianjin Textile Industry Bureau have been improved and improved to varying degrees in quality. Red cloth has been listed by the trade department as one of the best products of its kind in the country. The malachite green poplin is brightly colored and in short supply. The printed skirt cloth produced by the First Printing and Dyeing Factory has added new patterns this year and the quality is excellent. Trade departments in Gansu, Chongqing and other provinces and cities are vying to order it. The glazed paper and striped kraft paper produced by the paper mill under the First Light Industry Bureau were rated as excellent products at the quality evaluation meeting of the China Cultural Supplies Company. Because the product quality has been improved and welcomed by consumers, the sales of many products have been expanded.
    The quality of many exported products has also been greatly improved. Such as iron wire, round nails, sewing machines, glazed paper, dyes - boiled red, jujube red, red-brown, etc., are welcomed by foreigners.

Wuxi Factories Launch High-Quality Movement

    Factories in Wuxi are launching a high-quality industrial product movement.
    Many factories have studied and analyzed the key problems in production and actively taken measures to improve product quality. According to the main problems in the current product quality, Qingfeng Textile Factory initially proposed the key points and measures for each process. For example, the scutching room should grasp the impurity content of raw cotton and do a good job in mixing cotton. The factory also summarized and learned from the advanced experience of the factory and other places, and improved the rationalization proposal handling procedures. Now, the impurities in the cotton yarn in this factory have been reduced from about 150 grains to about 110 grains, and the qualified rate of the sizing tank has stabilized at about 80%. After mobilizing the masses, Limin Porcelain Factory found out the reasons for the poor quality of products and improvement methods. After March 17, the rate of first-class porcelain bowls has reached 65%, more than double the planned target.

New Achievements of a Joint State-Private Enterprise

    The standard product rate of cotton yarn produced by Hubei Factory of Yuhua Textile Company, a joint state-private enterprise, in March has exceeded the national target by 3.58%; among them, all 32-count yarns are standard products, and 66.84% have reached the specifications of high-quality products; The medium and high-quality products of 21-count yarn also reached 89.58%.
    In the first quarter, the workers of the factory put forward 142 rationalization proposals to improve quality, of which 19 have been summarized by technicians and promoted throughout the factory. The workers have also learned seven operating methods to improve quality. (Xinhua News Agency)

Promote the Advanced Experience of "Deoxidation After Furnace"

    Angang Steelmaking Plant is comprehensively promoting the advanced Soviet experience of "deoxidation after furnace". As of the 3rd, the employees had saved 288 tons of ferromanganese, worth 160,000 yuan, in 76 days.
    This new operation method is to change the past addition of ferromanganese in the furnace before tapping to the addition of ferromanganese outside the furnace after tapping, which can reduce the ferromanganese recovery rate and reduce ferromanganese consumption. This advanced experience was first successfully tested on two open hearth furnaces, and the steel produced was of very good quality. (Xinhua News Agency)

    进一步提高工业品质量
    马鞍山铁厂的最高纪录
    马鞍山铁厂第一季度生产的生铁，合格率达到99.45％，创造了建厂以来季度生铁质量最高纪录。
    过去这个厂的生铁质量很差，经常受到用铁单位的批评。今年这个工厂制定出了提高生铁质量的措施。炼铁工人认真地推广了苏联快速燃烧、原料管理等先进炼铁经验，有效地执行了苏联专家关于提高生铁质量的六项建议，使生铁的质量一月比一月提高。三月一日到二十九日所产生铁的合格率达到99.81％。
    组织技术人员解决关键问题
    为了保证纱布质量达到新的质量标准，唐山市公私合营华新纺织厂，在三月初组织技术人员深入现场工作。技术人员对工人操作情况和产品进行了分析，提出了影响产品质量等方面的各项技术关键问题。接着，技术人员订出具体措施，保证在上半年同工人一起，推广苏联和兄弟厂的七项先进经验，总结本厂工人操作经验，以提高产品质量。
    天津三百多种产品质量比去年提高
    第一季度，天津市地方工业各厂有三百多种产品的质量比去年提高。天津市纺织工业局各厂生产的色布和花布，有许多种花色品种在质量上有不同程度的改进和提高。红布已经被贸易部门列为全国同类产品中最好的产品之一。石绿色的府绸，色泽鲜艳，供不应求。第一印染厂生产的花裙子布，今年又增加了花样，质量优良，甘肃、重庆等省市贸易部门都争着订货。第一轻工业局所属造纸厂的有光纸、条纹牛皮纸，在中国文化用品公司的质量评比会议上被评为优良产品。因为产品质量有了改进，受到消费者的欢迎，不少产品的销路都扩大了。
    许多出口的产品质量也大为提高。如铁丝、元钉、缝纫机、有光纸、染料——煮红、枣红、红棕等，都受到国外人士的欢迎。无锡市各工厂开展优良质量运动
    无锡市各工厂正在开展工业品优良质量运动。
    许多工厂已经研究分析了生产中的关键问题，积极采取措施，提高产品质量。庆丰纺织厂根据当前产品质量上存在的主要问题，初步提出了各道工序的关键和措施。如清花间应该掌握原棉含杂情况，做好混棉工作等。这个厂还总结和学习了本厂和外地的先进经验，并且改善了合理化建议处理程序。现在，这个厂棉纱的杂质已经由一百五十粒减少到一百一十粒左右，浆缸合格率稳定在80％左右。利民磁厂经过发动群众，找出产品质量低劣的原因和改进办法，三月十七日以后磁碗特等品率已经达到65％，超过计划指标一倍以上。
    一个公私合营企业的新成绩
    公私合营裕华纺织公司湖北厂三月份出产的棉纱的标准品率已经超过国家指标3.58％；其中三十二支纱全部是标准品，并有66.84％达到了上等品的规格；二十一支纱的中、上等品也达到89.58％。
    全厂的职工在第一季度内提出了142条提高质量的合理化建议，其中有十九条经过技术人员总结，已经在全厂推广。工人们还学会了七种提高质量的操作法。　（据新华社讯）
    推行“炉后脱氧”先进经验
    鞍钢炼钢厂正在全面推行苏联“炉后脱氧”先进经验。到三日为止，职工们在七十六天里已经节约了二百八十八吨锰铁，价值十六万元。
    这种新操作方法是把过去出钢前在炉内加锰铁，改为出钢后在炉外加锰铁，这样可以减少锰铁收得率，减少锰铁消耗。这一先进经验是先在两座平炉上试验成功的，炼出来的钢，质量很好。
