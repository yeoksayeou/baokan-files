    Soviet Experts Participate in Tree Planting
    Xinhua News Agency, 8th April – Today, Soviet experts working in Beijing enthusiastically participated in tree planting with their families. In two hours, they planted 14,000 saplings of various kinds.
    In the morning, the experts arrived one after another with their children and wives at the banks of the Dongba River in Jiuxianqiao, eastern suburbs. In the warm sunshine, they immediately began working in an organized manner. Some competed to carry saplings, while others carried water, dug trenches, planted seedlings, and earthed up the soil. The children also participated in tasks they could manage.
    Experts from the Beijing Forestry College walked back and forth on the site, providing technical guidance.
    As rows of small trees were planted, the experts also carefully measured the spacing between them.
    When the work was completed, they carried their tools and took a group photo with their Chinese friends on the site.

    苏联专家参加植树
    新华社8日讯　今天，在北京工作的苏联专家们带着家属热情地参加了植树造林。两小时内栽植了各种树苗一万四千棵。
    早上，专家们带着孩子、夫人陆续到达东郊酒仙桥东坝河两岸。在和暖的阳光下，他（她）们立即有组织地开始了劳动。有的争着抬树苗，有的挑水、挖槽、植苗和培土。孩子们也参加了能够做到的劳动。
    北京林学院的专家在工地上来回奔走，为他们做技术指导。
    当一排排小树栽起来的时候，专家们还认真量了株距。
    工作完毕时，他们扛着工具和中国朋友在工地上合影留念。
