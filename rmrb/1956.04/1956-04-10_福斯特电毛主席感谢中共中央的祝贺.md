Xinhua News Agency, 9th April. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong to thank the CCP Central Committee for its congratulations on his seventy-fifth birthday. The telegram reads as follows:

Dear Comrade Mao Zedong,

I am deeply honored to receive the letter of congratulations from your Party Central Committee on the occasion of my seventy-fifth birthday. Please accept my warmest thanks.

The rulers of the United States, like those of other capitalist countries, are constantly, more or less, in a state of astonishment at the great revolutionary achievements of the Chinese people over the past decade. These great achievements, especially those which capitalist bosses regard as simply social "miracles," are beyond the true understanding of the bourgeois mind.

At first, the spokesmen of American capitalism were absolutely certain that in China, the Communist army could not defeat the army of Chiang Kai-shek, the tool of Wall Street. When this "miracle" occurred, they then asserted that the Communist Party could not organize and lead the vast and sprawling China; to do so was merely a fantasy. But this second great "miracle" was again achieved, and they were wrong again. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the invincible Chinese people will create many greater "miracles." As for those whose minds are extremely agitated, their ideas will continue to be corrected by many "miracles" in the future. People's China has become a first-class world power in the past few short years, and has become one of the most decisive forces in the struggle of the world proletariat and its allies for peace, prosperity and socialism; every communist in the world, every working-class fighter, is delighted and excited by these spectacular advances of People's China.

Your comrade, William Foster (signed), February 29, 1956

    福斯特电毛主席感谢中共中央的祝贺
    新华社9日讯　美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特打电报给毛泽东主席，感谢中共中央在他七十五岁寿辰之际对他的祝贺。电文如下：亲爱的毛泽东同志：
    在我的七十五岁寿辰之际，承你们党中央委员会来信祝贺，这实在使我深感荣幸。请接受我最热烈的感谢。
    美国的统治者们，正如其他资本主义国家的一样，对于过去十年来中国人民极大的革命成就是经常地或多或少地处于惊讶状态中的。这些伟大的成就，特别是资本主义老板们视为简直是社会“奇迹”的成就，是资产阶级头脑所不能真正理解的。
    起初，美国资本主义的发言人曾经绝对肯定地说，在中国，共产党的军队是不可能击败华尔街的工具蒋介石的军队的。当这个“奇迹”出现以后，他们又肯定地说，共产党是不能够组织和领导起庞大而散漫的中国的，要这样做只是幻想而已。可是这后一个伟大的“奇迹”又被取得了，他们又失算了。在共产党的领导下，无敌的中国人民将会创造出许多更大的“奇迹”。至于他们这些脑筋极不冷静的人，他们的想法将来仍然会被许多“奇迹”所纠正的。人民中国在过去短短几年中已经成为第一流的世界强国，成为世界无产阶级及其同盟者在为争取和平、繁荣和社会主义的斗争中的一支最有决定性的力量；世界上每一个共产党人，每一个工人阶级战士都因人民中国这些奇观般的进展感到愉快、感到激动。
              你的同志　威廉·福斯特（签名）　1956年2月29日
