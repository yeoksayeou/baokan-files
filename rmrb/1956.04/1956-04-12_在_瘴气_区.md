    In the "Miasma" Area
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    Going south from Kunming along the Kunming-Daduo road for 1,500 li, you arrive at the Xishuangbanna area in the lower reaches of the Lancang River. Here, the mountains are covered with boundless primeval forests, interspersed with large bamboo groves, tea plantations, and camphor forests. These forests are home to herds of elephants, deer, monkeys, peacocks, and other unnamed wild animals. On the fertile lands of Jinghong, Ganlanba, Nanqiao..., you can plant crops at any time and harvest two to three crops a year. Although the farmers here lack knowledge of fertilization, their rice yields 500 jin per mu. Here, herds of cattle and horses are not tended by anyone; they eat their fill of green grass by the forest and drink their fill of clear spring water, then automatically return home. Here, the leaves never fall, and the grass never withers. But this place was once the most severe "miasma" area in Yunnan Province, also known as the "ultra-high malaria area." Here, a terrifying ballad once circulated: "If you want to go down to Jinghong (i.e., the Yun Jinghong plain), marry off your wife first." Here, I heard how malaria once brought immeasurable suffering to the people.
    Two hundred years ago, the Xishuangbanna area had a population of 1.2 million, but when this area was liberated, it had only 260,000 people. Before liberation, the Bamo Village in Ganlanba once had 44 births in a year, but the number of deaths was 68; Mengla once had 24 births in a year, but the number of deaths was 35. At that time, people prayed to "gods and ghosts" for safety, and offering sacrifices to "gods" and "ghosts" became their only way to treat illnesses. People's lives were massively dying and decreasing in the worship of "gods" and supplication to "Buddha." Here, it was rare for people to live to be fifty or sixty years old in the past. The people of Yakou Village in Gelang clearly remember the terrible year of 1944. In that year, in just nine months, more than 150 people died in the village of over a hundred households due to the prevalence of malaria. The sinful Kuomintang local government watched the people die in the "miasma." By the time this place was liberated, only thirty households remained in this village. Some families moved from the valley to the mountains to escape the "miasma," or from this mountain to that mountain. When malaria was prevalent, the people living in the mountains did not even dare to go down the mountain to buy things. No matter how they tried to avoid the disaster of malaria, the "miasma" closely pursued the people here. No matter how rich this place was, people were so poor that they could not afford clothes, and there was not enough food to eat.
    The people of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, like the people of other regions, only ended those terrible and painful days after the Communist Party liberated this region. The "miasma" area has now become a historical term. In Yun Jinghong, which has been called the "ultra-high malaria area" for one or two hundred years, highways now pass through from the distant interior, and buses and transport vehicles shuttle back and forth, supporting the people here. On the Pingba in the depths of the dense forest on the banks of the Lancang River, the buildings of the CPC Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture Committee and the Autonomous Prefecture Government, department stores, and schools have been built. In the southeast corner of Yun Jinghong, close to the banks of the Lancang River, there are two beautiful milky white buildings, which are the Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture National Hospital, which now has thirty beds and receives many outpatients every day. The person in charge of this area told me that their autonomous region has five health clinics, one health and epidemic prevention team, and two maternal and child health stations, as well as more than ten midwifery stations. The Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture has been established for three years, and now has more than 180 health workers. They are now stepping up the training of health workers from the Dai, Hani, Lahu, and other ethnic minorities. What was the situation of health personnel in this area before liberation? A doctor at the National Hospital said: At that time, there was only one doctor in the church of American imperialism, who trained two health workers in Yun Jinghong for the purpose of preaching religion. One of them was a counter-revolutionary, and the other had very poor skills. In order to completely change the terrible face of the "miasma" area, our Party transferred health workers from various places, some from Guangdong, some from Sichuan, and some from the Northeast. These comrades, in accordance with the instructions of the Party, with the enthusiasm of serving the people, no matter how high the mountains were, how many wild animals there were, no matter how difficult the roads were, no matter how unaccustomed they were to the life, insisted on treating the local people, so that the people living in this beautiful and rich land can have a happy life.
    Local health workers, combined with the Party's current work, have launched health campaigns in many places. Health personnel convene village representative meetings and conduct patient education among the masses. They held health exhibitions centered on the most prevalent malaria and ascariasis and tapeworm disease in the local area, so that the masses could understand from slides, microscopes, and exhibited objects that the cause of these diseases was the transmission of bacteria, not the arrival of gods and ghosts. When the epidemic prevention team launched a health campaign in Mancang Village, they used the examples of Maitao Ken and Wei Handan to mobilize the masses. Before liberation, Maitao Ken's husband and twelve sons, and one son-in-law, all died of malaria and other infectious diseases, leaving Maitao Ken helpless and destitute. Wei Handan contracted malaria while harvesting, causing the grain to be ruined in the fields. The masses listened to these practical examples until late at night and were reluctant to leave. Some people said: If we continue to be superstitious and do not pay attention to hygiene, we will have no descendants before we get to socialism. Therefore, the Dai people of Mancang Village cleared away the garbage of two hundred years in a very short period of time. They had never fertilized before, but in the health campaign, they turned more than 2,000 loads of garbage into fertilizer, increasing rice production by 20%. The habit of cleaning up in Mancang Village has been maintained for two years, and the entire village has a major cleaning every five days. Our health personnel have been to many villages to conduct malaria examinations for the masses and to give preventive injections to people with malaria bacteria. They helped the masses build pig and cattle pens, and also built roads in the village. There were no toilets in the past, but now many toilets have been built. In the past, 80% of the people in Manxiao Village contracted malaria every year, but last year only about ten people fell ill and were quickly cured. Now the people of Xishuangbanna generally believe in scientific treatment. Even the monks who used to offer sacrifices to "gods" and send away "ghosts" have to go to the National Hospital when they are sick. A senior monk in Menghai, Banna, contracted enteritis and went to the National Hospital for treatment. After the hospital performed surgery on him and cured him, he firmly refused to be a monk and wanted to stay in the hospital as a civil servant. Batu Jintao, the headman of Mengyang, contracted syphilis, pneumonia, and malaria, and was on the verge of death. After the hospital cured him, he no longer asked the monks to chant scriptures, saying, "I firmly believe in the words of the Communist Party and follow the Communist Party." Four people from the Gelang and Hani ethnic groups contracted hernias, and had been unable to work in the fields for more than ten years, and had difficulty walking. After the National Hospital quickly cured them, Lao Da, who had a hernia, said: "In the past, the people in the temple said: There are ghosts in our village, and this disease will not get better. Now that we have the Communist Party, my disease has been cured." In the past, when women gave birth, they knelt and squatted behind the door. If they encountered dystocia, people said that a ghost had come, and some would press on the woman's stomach with wooden sticks, and some would tear down the house. After the establishment of the National Hospital and maternal and child health stations and midwifery stations, they actively carried out maternal and child health work, and earnestly carried out prenatal and postnatal examinations and visits. In Nanqiao, young female medical workers, in addition to holding meetings to carry out propaganda and education on maternal and infant hygiene knowledge to young women, also went door-to-door to mobilize women. In the villages surrounding the maternal and child health station, when women gave birth to children, they would run to examine and bathe the children. The maternal and child health station established in Manfeilong in November of last year delivered twenty-one children by the end of December. None of these twenty-one children had any illnesses after birth. Some mothers recognized the young female midwives as the godmothers of their children. A Dai woman in Manjing had lost eight children in the past due to umbilical cord infections. Her ninth child was delivered by medical personnel, and is now more than one year old. She said gratefully to the medical personnel: "Without the Communist Party, I would not have been able to have children in my life."
    The so-called "miasma" can no longer threaten the people here. Now here, there are more children than in any past era, and they are all healthy. They are growing up as our new generation, living a happier life day by day.

    在“瘴气”区
    本报记者　陈勇进
    从昆明沿昆（明）洛（打洛）公路南行一千五百里，便到了澜沧江下游的西双版纳地区。在这里，山上生长着无边际的原始森林，在森林间，夹杂着大片大片的竹林、茶林、樟脑林，在这森林里居住着象群、鹿群、猴群、孔雀群和其他叫不出名字的野兽。在景洪?、橄榄?、南桥?……的肥沃土地上，不管什么时候都可以下种，一年可以收两季到三季庄稼。这里的农民虽然没有施肥的知识，但他们的稻子每亩却可收五百斤；在这里成群的牛马没有专人来饲养，它们在林边吃饱青草，喝足清泉就自动地走回家里去；在这里树叶永不落，草儿永不枯。可是这地方，曾经是云南省最严重的“瘴气”区，也叫“超高度的疟疾区”。在这里曾经流传着“要下景洪?（即允景洪平原地带），先把老婆嫁”的可怕歌谣。在这里我听到疟疾病曾经给人们带来无比深重的灾难。
    西双版纳地区，二百年前曾有一百二十万人，可是当这个地区解放的时候只有二十六万人。解放以前，橄榄?的八磨寨曾经在一年中生了四十四个小孩，但死亡的人口却是六十八人；勐腊?曾经在一年中出生二十四个小孩，而死亡的人口却是三十五人。那时候，人们向“神鬼”祈祷安全，祭“神”祭“鬼”成了他们治病的唯一方法，人们的生命就在祭“神”求“佛”里大量地死亡着、减少着。在这里，能够活到五六十岁的人在过去是很少的。格郎和的牙口寨的人们清楚地记得可怕的1944年。那一年，仅仅在九个月里，百多户的寨子因为疟疾病的流行就死了150人。罪恶的国民党地方政府眼看着人们在“瘴气”里死亡，到这个地方解放的时候，这个寨子就只剩下三十户人家了。有的人家为了躲避“瘴气”，从?区迁往高山，或从这座高山迁到那座高山。疟疾病流行的时候，居住在山上的人们连下山买点东西也不敢。不管他们怎样躲避疟疾流行的灾难，“瘴气”还是紧紧地追赶着这里的人们。不管这里有多么富饶，人们却贫困得穿不上衣服，粮食也不够吃。
    西双版纳傣族自治州的人民也像其它地区的人民一样，只有在共产党把这个地区解放以后，才结束了那可怕的痛苦的日子。“瘴气”区现在已成为历史上的名词了。在一二百年来被称为“超高度的疟疾区”的允景洪，现在公路从遥远的内地通过来，公共汽车和运输车穿梭般地奔驰着，支援着这里的人民。在澜沧江边密林深处的平?上，中共西双版纳自治州委员会和自治州政府、百货公司、学校的楼房盖起来了。在允景洪的东南角，紧靠着澜沧江边，有两幢美丽的乳白色的楼房，那就是西双版纳自治州的民族医院，现在有三十张病床，每天都有许多人到这里来门诊。这个地区的负责人告诉我，他们自治区有五个卫生所、一个卫生防疫队，还有两个妇幼保健站，十多个接生站。西双版纳自治州成立了三年，现在已经有卫生工作人员180多人；现在他们正在加紧训练傣族、哈尼族、拉祜族和其它少数民族的卫生工作人员。在解放以前，这个地区的卫生人员的情况是什么样子呢？民族医院的医生说：那时候只有美国帝国主义的教堂里有一个医生，他以传教为目的在允景洪训练了两个卫生人员，其中一个是反革命分子，另一个技术也很低劣。我们的党为了彻底改变“瘴气”区的可怕的面貌，从各地调来了卫生工作者，他们中有的来自广东，有的来自四川，有的来自东北。这些同志按照党的指示，满怀着为人民服务的热情，不管山有多么大，野兽有多么多，不管路有多么难走，不管生活有多么不习惯，都坚持着给当地的群众治病，让居住在这美丽富饶的国土上的人民得到幸福的生活。
    当地的卫生工作者，结合党的当前工作，在不少地方开展了卫生运动。卫生人员召开村里的代表会，在群众中进行耐心的教育。他们围绕着当地最流行的疟疾病和蛔虫、条虫病举办了卫生展览会，使群众在幻灯、显微镜里和展览的实物中认识患这些病的原因是细菌的传染，不是什么神鬼临门。防疫队在曼藏寨开展卫生运动的时候，就以麦陶肯和未罕旦的例子来动员群众。解放前麦陶肯的丈夫和十二个儿子，一个女婿都患疟疾及其他传染病死了，弄得麦陶肯无依无靠，生活无着。未罕旦正在收割时得了疟疾病，使谷子都毁在田里。群众对这些实际例子听到深夜还不愿离去，有的人说：再迷信不讲究卫生，过不到社会主义就要断子绝孙了，因此，曼藏寨的傣族群众在很短的时间里就把二百年来的垃圾清除掉了。他们过去从来没有施肥的习惯，在卫生运动中把清除的两千多挑垃圾变成肥料，使稻子增产20％。曼藏寨打扫卫生的习惯已经保持了二年，全寨每隔五天要大扫除一次。我们的卫生人员到过很多的村庄，给群众进行疟疾的检查，给有疟疾菌的人们进行预防注射。他们帮助群众给猪牛都修了圈，还在村里修了公路，过去没有厕所，现在也修了很多厕所。过去曼孝村每年全村有80％的人得疟疾病，去年只有十来个人发病并迅速地治好了。现在西双版纳的人们，普遍地相信科学的治疗，就是那些过去替人们祭“神”送“鬼”的和尚有了病也不得不跑到民族医院里去。版纳勐海的一个大和尚，得了肠炎病到民族医院里去医治，医院里给他动了手术，把病治好以后，他就坚决不当和尚，要留在医院里做公务员的工作。勐养的头人口八金陶得了梅毒、肺炎和疟疾，眼看要死，医院给他治好以后，就不再求和尚念经了，他说：“我坚决相信共产党的话，跟着共产党走。”格朗族和哈尼族有四个人得了疝气病，十几年来不能下田生产，走路也很困难，民族医院很快给他们治好以后，得疝气的劳达说：“过去寺院的人说：我们寨子里有鬼，这病不会好，现在有了共产党，我的病就治好了。”过去，妇女生产的时候都是跪着蹲在门后边，如果碰到难产，人们就说鬼来了，有的就用木棍在妇女的肚子上压，有的要把房子拆掉。民族医院和保健站、接生站成立以后，积极地进行妇幼卫生的工作，切实地做到了产前产后的检查和访问。在南桥?，年青的女医务工作者除了开会向青年妇女们进行妇婴卫生常识的宣传教育外，还挨家挨户地向妇女们进行动员。在妇幼保健站的周围村庄里妇女生了小孩，她们就跑去给小孩检查、洗澡。去年十一月间在曼飞龙建立的妇幼保健站，到十二月底，就接生了二十一个小孩。这二十一个小孩在出生以后都没有得什么病。有的孩子的母亲把年青的女接生人员认做自己孩子的干妈。曼经的一个傣族妇女过去生了八个孩子都得脐风病死了，她的第九个孩子是由医务人员接生的，现在已经一岁多了。她感激地对医务人员说：“没有共产党，我这一辈子也得不上小孩。”
    过去所说的“瘴气”，再也不能威胁这里的人民了。现在在这里，小孩比过去任何时代都多，都健康。他们作为我们新的一代在成长着，过着一天比一天更加幸福的生活。
