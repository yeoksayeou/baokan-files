Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 8th - The latest issue of "Blitz" weekly published a dispatch from Saigon stating that Ngo Dinh Diem has drafted a plan to gradually control Laos and Cambodia. The US State Department not only knows about this plan but is also providing all possible encouragement to facilitate its implementation; the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's current blockade of Cambodia is part of this strategy.

The dispatch points out that Ngo Dinh Diem's first step is to hope to conclude an economic aid agreement, according to which South Vietnam will supply rice and some American goods to Cambodia and Laos, thereby linking the economies of these countries with South Vietnam.

Ngo Dinh Diem also plans to conclude a military aid treaty. South Vietnam intends to assist Laos in fighting the Pathet Lao forces. In addition, the establishment of a joint force composed of the armies of various countries has been discussed. The army will be trained and commanded by American instructors.

    在美国国务院的鼓励下
    吴庭艳策划控制老挝和柬埔寨
    新华社新德里8日电　最近一期“闪电”周报刊登了西贡来的电讯说，吴庭艳已经拟就了一项逐步控制老挝和柬埔寨的计划。美国国务院不仅知道这一项计划，而且还正在给予一切可能的鼓励以促其实现；东南亚条约组织目前对柬埔寨的封锁就是这种策略的一部分。
    电讯指出，吴庭艳第一步是希望缔结经济援助协定，根据这个协定，南越将把大米和一些美国物资供给柬埔寨和老挝，以此来使这些国家和南越的经济联系起来。
    吴庭艳还计划缔结军事援助条约。南越打算援助老挝来同寮国战斗部队作战。此外，还讨论了建立由各国的军队组成联军的问题。军队将由美国教官来训练和指挥。
