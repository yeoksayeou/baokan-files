Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 10th (TASS) - Uruguay's "El Diario" published a statement by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Colombia, condemning the Colombian government's recently issued decree "prohibiting communism and punishing those who disseminate or assist in the dissemination of communist ideas."

The statement said that this fascist decree is a copy of the American McCarran Act, and its spearhead is directed at all those who oppose military dictatorship and repressive policies. The statement accused the Colombian dictatorial government of selling out national independence for dollars, stifling national freedom, rendering the role of parliament meaningless, abolishing elections, and placing the country and its wealth under the control of American monopoly capital.

The statement called on the working people and all progressive strata of residents to unite and strive to establish a democratic government of national liberation that can guarantee democratic freedoms, the rights of the working people, peace, and the progress and independence of Colombia.
