    Experts Who Select Lines with a Sense of Ownership
    Wang Guobin Liu Zhao
    On the summit of the Tin Mine Mountain in Gejiu, Yunnan, there is a surveying team whose task is to select an economical special railway line for tin ore along a nearly 1,000-meter elevation difference from the mountaintop to the foot. Among the surveying personnel, there is an experienced engineer in his sixties named Luo Xiaoxun. He was invited by the Ministry of Heavy Industry from the Ministry of Railways in Beijing to come here.
    Originally, the railway design team of the Tin Industry Company had designed this special line several times. In their designs, they believed that the only way to solve the problem of excessive natural slope was to extend the line by winding around, resulting in a narrow-gauge line for steam locomotives. This line was winding and tortuous, climbing the mountain, resulting in huge engineering costs and failing to meet the needs of transportation.
    After learning about this situation, Engineer Luo decided to redesign a special line that was both economical and could meet production needs.
    Engineer Luo, like the young people, walked through the high mountains, observing the natural terrain and slopes around the mine. He repeatedly conducted on-site reconnaissance and carefully studied the survey data, thinking intently about the outline of the line he required. During the design process, he immediately consulted Soviet experts when he encountered difficult problems. Finally, he boldly decided to adopt a limiting slope of 30 per thousand, minimizing the radius of the line's curves, shortening the originally designed winding mountain road by 37.5 kilometers, and saving 38.12 million yuan in engineering investment. To solve the problem of traction, he proposed the use of electric traction based on various conditions. His suggestion was praised by Soviet experts as a "smart suggestion."
    This old engineer is constantly encouraged by the new victories of China's railway construction. His heart is filled with a source of joy and pleasure. He feels that he should work vigorously and find economical and suitable lines with a high degree of responsibility. However, this sense of responsibility did not suddenly appear in Engineer Luo's mind, but was generated in struggle.
    In 1950, Engineer Luo participated in the surveying and design work of the Tianlan Railway for the first time. In the middle section of the Tianlan Railway, there is a "Qu'ercha" tunnel. According to the original design, the section of the line entering the tunnel was uphill. The engineer who made the original design thought that this would shorten the length of the tunnel. Engineer Luo believed, based on his research materials from various sources, that although the original design shortened the tunnel construction by 500 meters, it did not consider that the line would have to turn a large winding road after exiting the tunnel, which would extend the line construction by five kilometers and cause a great waste. He put forward his opinion: let the line go downhill as soon as it enters the tunnel. Although the tunnel would be extended by 500 meters, the train would not have to climb the winding road. Engineer Luo had told the Northwest Main Line Engineering Bureau about this opinion and requested a change in the original design. His suggestion was opposed by some engineering and technical personnel. At first, Engineer Luo still insisted on his opinion. However, when he was opposed from all sides, he retreated! Because he recalled the story of participating in the design of the Xiangqian Railway before liberation. At that time, the line design had been determined, but he still worked tirelessly in the deserted mountains and ridges in order to select an economical and reasonable line. After on-site reconnaissance, he enthusiastically put forward suggestions for modifying the line, which was estimated to save tens of thousands of yuan at that time. However, this fiery heart was not only unwelcome, but also subjected to blows and sarcasm. Some people said that he was showing off. In the comparison of these two things, he did not think that the era he was in had changed, and he did not think that adhering to the truth was his glorious duty. He finally gave up his opinion.
    The Tianlan Railway was opened to traffic before National Day in 1952.
    One day, Soviet expert Kaplanov came to the Tianlan Railway and quickly discovered the error in the design of the "Qu'ercha" tunnel. When the Soviet expert and Engineer Luo were studying this issue, Engineer Luo excitedly told him about his original opinion.
  The expert shook Engineer Luo's hand tightly and said, "Yes! Your suggestion is valuable! But why wasn't it implemented?"
    After returning to Beijing, a vice minister of the Ministry of Railways learned about this and also said to Engineer Luo, "Correct opinions should be insisted on to the end to make them realized. For the sake of the country's interests, we must never give up the struggle against wrong opinions. This is the attitude of the master. At the same time, we must also see that correct opinions will eventually be victorious!"
    These words had a profound impact on Engineer Luo's thinking. He regretted that he should not have retreated in the face of struggle in the past. From then on, he resolved not to look at today's new society with old eyes, and he must work with a sense of ownership in the future.
    Soon, the central government approved the proposal to build the Baocheng Railway and instructed the original Northwest Design Branch to conduct preliminary reconnaissance. They put forward two comparative lines in the north and south sections, and the plan was based on a double-engine traction slope of 20 per thousand and a minimum radius of 300 meters. The amount of work in this design scheme was very large. There were many tunnels and high bridges to be built along the line. Even the stations were designed on high bridges and in the middle of tunnels.
    The task of designing the Baocheng Railway was brought up. Engineer Luo accepted this new task, and he felt particularly excited. He collected all the existing survey and design data, and learned about the difficulties of this line's poor geological conditions, complex terrain, and steep natural slope – as high as 40 per thousand. Despite this, he felt that he must never bow his head in the face of difficulties. During repeated studies, he consulted various books when he encountered technical problems, especially how to solve the problem of steep slopes. After careful consideration, he proposed a line setting suggestion in early 1953: increase the limiting slope to 30 per thousand, change the line extension method, and adopt the river line to adapt to the terrain of the Qingjiang River valley. Due to the lack of technical data at the time, this suggestion was not immediately adopted by the Ministry of Railways.
    Having learned the lesson from the Tianlan Railway, Engineer Luo unswervingly insisted on his suggestion. More than half a year later, after careful study, the Ministry of Railways adopted his suggestion and decided to use electric locomotives for traction - this is the first railway in China to use electric locomotives. According to his suggested design, the Baocheng line with a slope of 30 per thousand was shortened by 18.2 kilometers compared with the original line with a slope of 20 per thousand, saving as much as 60.54 million yuan in construction costs.
    Now, Engineer Luo has been honorably selected as a representative of advanced producers nationwide. On the eve of the meeting, although he had just been discharged from the hospital after recovering from his illness, he was still radiant and talked to us about the past and his wishes. He said: "...Don't look at the fact that I am over sixty years old this year, I will devote all my energy to the cause of socialist construction and work as enthusiastically as young people."

    用主人翁态度选线的专家
    王国宾　刘钊
    在云南个旧的锡矿山山顶上，有一个勘测队，他们要在这段由山顶到山脚高差近一千公尺的地方，选出一条经济的锡矿专用铁路线。在这队勘测人员中间，有一位六十多岁的老工程师罗孝僔。他应重工业部的邀请，从北京铁道部来到这里的。
    原来，锡业公司的铁道设计组，早就把这条专用线设计了好几次，在设计中他们认为解决自然坡度过大的办法，只有迂回延展线路，结果设计出来一条用蒸汽机车牵引的窄轨线路。这条线迂回曲折，盘山而上，工程费用太大，而且也满足不了运输的需要。
    罗工程师知道了这个情况以后，决定重新设计一条既经济又能满足生产需要的专用线。
    罗工程师和青年人一样，奔走在高山峻岭上，观察矿山周围的自然形势和坡度。他反复地进行实地踏勘，又仔细地研究了测绘资料，专心地思索他所要求的线路轮廓。设计过程中，他遇到疑难的问题，立刻虚心地向苏联专家请教。终于大胆地决定采用千分之三十的限制坡度，尽量缩小线路的湾道半径，把原来设计出的迂回盘山道缩短了37.5公里，节省了3，812万元工程投资。在解决牵引能力的问题上，他又根据各种条件，提出了采用电机牵引的建议。他的这个建议曾被苏联专家誉为“聪明的建议”。
    这位老工程师，不断地受到我国铁路建设的新胜利的鼓舞。他内心充满愉快和喜悦的源泉。他觉得自己应该朝气勃勃地去工作，应该以高度的责任心去寻找经济而适用的线路。不过，这样一种责任感，并不是突然在罗工程师思想里出现的，而是在斗争中产生的。
    1950年，罗工程师第一次参加天兰路的勘测设计工作。天兰路中段，有一座“曲儿岔”隧道，按原设计进隧道的一段线路是上坡，依照原设计的工程师的意图这样可以缩短隧道的长度。罗工程师根据他从各方面研究的材料，认为原来的设计虽然缩短了五百公尺的隧道建筑，但是没有想到线路出隧道以后要转一个大盘山道，会延长五公里的线路建设，这会造成很大的浪费。他提出了自己的意见：让线路一进隧道就走下坡，虽然隧道延长五百公尺，火车就可以不爬盘山道了。罗工程师曾把这个意见告诉了西北干线工程局，要求改变原来的设计。他的这个建议，遭受一些工程技术人员的反对。开始，罗工程师还坚持自己的意见。但是，当遭受各方面反对的时候，他退缩了！因为他回想到解放前参加湘黔路设计的故事，当时线路设计已经确定，但是他仍旧为了选出一条经济而又合理的线路，不辞辛苦地奔走在荒无人烟的崇山峻岭间。他经过实地勘测，热情地提出了修改线路的意见，当时估计可以节省几十万元。但是，他这一颗火热的心，不仅不受欢迎，反而遭到打击讽刺，有些人说他是出风头。在这两件事的对比中，他没有想到他所处的时代变了，没有想到坚持真理是自己的光荣职责。他终于放弃了自己的意见。
    1952年国庆节前夕，天兰路通车了。
    一天，苏联专家卡普拉诺夫来到天兰路，很快地发现了“曲儿岔”隧道设计上的错误。当苏联专家和罗工程师研究这个问题的时候，罗工程师兴奋地把他原来的意见说了出来。
  专家紧紧地握着罗工程师的手说：“对啊！你的建议是可贵的！可是，怎么没有实现呢？”
    回到北京后，铁道部的一位副部长知道了这回事，也对罗工程师说：“正确的意见应该坚持到底，要使它实现。为了国家的利益，绝不能放弃对错误意见的斗争。这就是主人翁的工作态度。同时，也必须看到，正确的意见，终究是会得到胜利的！”
    这些话在罗工程师的思想上起了深刻的影响。他后悔过去不该在斗争面前退却了。从此，他决心不再用旧的眼光来看今天的新社会，今后一定要以主人翁的态度进行工作。
    不久，中央批准了修筑宝成线的建议，并且责成原西北设计分局作了初步勘测。他们提出了南北段两个比较线，并且以千分之二十的双机牵引坡度，及最小半径三百公尺为原则的方案。这个设计方案的工程量很大，沿线要修建的隧道和高桥很多，甚至把车站也设计在高桥上面和隧道中间。
    设计宝成路的任务被提了出来。罗工程师接受了这个新的任务，他特别感到兴奋。他搜集了已有的全部勘测设计资料，了解了这段线路的地质不良、地形复杂、自然坡度陡——高达千分之四十以上等等困难。尽管这样，他觉得自己绝不能在困难面前低头。在反复研究期间，有时遇到技术上的难题，尤其是如何解决坡度陡的问题，他就翻阅各种书籍。经过深思熟虑，他在1953年初提出了一个定线建议：把限制坡度提高到千分之三十，变更线路延展方法，采用沿河线适应清姜河河谷地形。由于当时掌握的技术资料不足，这个建议并没有立即被铁道部采纳。
    接受了天兰路那次的教训，罗工程师毫不动摇地坚持着他的建议。过了半年多，铁道部经过仔细研究，采纳了他的建议，并且决定采用电气机车牵引——这是我国第一条使用电气机车的铁路。按照他的建议设计的宝成线路比原来千分之二十坡度的线路缩短了18.2公里，节省工程费达6，054万元之巨。
    现在，罗工程师光荣地被选为全国的先进生产者代表了。在会议的前夕，虽然他病愈刚出医院，但仍是精神焕发地和我们谈着往事和自己的愿望。他说：“……别看我今年六十多岁了，我将在社会主义建设的事业中拿出所有的精力，像青年人那样热情地工作。”
