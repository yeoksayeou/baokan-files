One of the largest inclined shaft coal mines in China, the Fushun Tiger Platform Coal Mine, had failed to meet the state plan month after month for quite some time in the past. Since January of this year, after all the mine's employees enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee to "increase production, speed up the pace, improve quality, and save resources" to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, they have actively carried out socialist emulation campaigns and created many advanced production experiences with great economic value. The famous 160-meter professional team assembly line coal mining method was created by worker Pang Guanxiang and technician Zhou Guangrui; Deputy Technician and District Chief Ding Yishan's connecting-type roof support ensured mining safety and saved one-third of the pit wood; Technician Zheng Jiahong advocated a four-shift alternating work method, which demonstrated its superiority with a 44.3% overfulfillment of the plan; the suggestion of young technician Cong Xiuyan to recover the coal pillars between sections could increase the recoverable coal by more than 10 million tons in the Tiger Platform mining area alone.

Now, the Fushun Tiger Platform Coal Mine is already an advanced coal mine. (Attached picture)

Worker Pang Guanxiang (right) and technician Zhou Guangrui (left) created the 160-meter professional team assembly line coal mining method, which is a comprehensive production reform from technical operation to labor organization. After the Fushun Tiger Platform Mine adopted this advanced coal mining method, the average daily output of coal mining per shift has increased from 400 tons to more than 900 tons, and the safety situation is good.

Ding Yishan, an old worker (now district chief) in the Fifth Mining Area, created a connecting-type roof support to prevent side wall caving accidents, further ensuring the safety of workers when mining in the pit, and can save a lot of pit wood.
Wang Haikuan's drilling assault team in the Second Mining Area adopted the straight drilling method created by Cong Xiuyan and Guo Chunyi, increasing production efficiency by 51%.
In the past two months, 900 workers have put forward more than 4,200 rationalization proposals. The members of the Rationalization Proposal Committee are reviewing the automatic rock drill design model created by the workers. Once this rock drill is successfully trial-produced, it will completely liberate the process of tunneling and other basic construction from heavy manual labor.

### 从落后到先进的抚顺老虎台煤矿

    我国斜井煤矿中最大的煤矿之一——抚顺老虎台煤矿，在过去相当长的一个时期内，月月不能完成国家计划。自从今年一月起，全矿职工热烈响应党中央提出的“又多、又快、又好、又省”提前完成五年计划的号召，积极开展社会主义竞赛以后，不仅在三月二十五日提早六天完成今年第一季度生产计划，而且创造了许多有很大经济价值的先进生产经验。著名的一百六十公尺专业队流水作业采煤法就是由工人庞观祥和技术员周广瑞创造的；副技师兼区长丁义山创造的连接式贴帮棚子，保证了采煤安全，并可节省坑木三分之一；技术员郑家洪倡议的四班交换作业法采用以后，以超额完成计划44.3％的成绩显示了它的优越性；青年技术员丛秀岩提出的回收段间煤柱的建议，单老虎台一个矿区就可以增加一千万吨以上可采的煤。
    现在，抚顺老虎台煤矿已经是先进的煤矿了。（附图片）

    工人庞观祥（右）和技术员周广瑞（左）创造的一百六十公尺专业队流水作业采煤法是一项从技术操作到劳动组织的综合性的生产改革。抚顺老虎台矿采用了这种先进的采煤法以后，每班采煤的平均日产量已经从四百吨达到九百多吨，而且安全情况良好。

    第五采煤区老工人（现任区长）丁义山创造了连接式的贴帮棚子，防止了偏帮冒顶事故，进一步保证了工人在坑内采煤时的安全，并可节省大量坑木。
    第二采煤区的王海宽打眼突击小组，采用丛秀岩、郭春宜创造的直打眼法，生产效率提高了51％。
    最近两个月以来，有九百个工人提出了四千二百多种合理化建议。合理化建议委员会的委员们正在这里审查工人们创造的自动凿岩机设计模型。这种凿岩机试制成功后，将使开凿巷道等基本建设的工序，完全解脱笨重的体力劳动。
