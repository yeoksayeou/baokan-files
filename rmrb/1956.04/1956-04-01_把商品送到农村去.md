State-owned department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Jiangsu Province are organizing joint state-private stores and cooperative stores in towns and cities to send people deep into the countryside to deliver goods to people's doors, making it easier for farmers to buy goods.

In the Suzhou area, six counties have already formed delivery teams in more than ten industries, including southern goods, liquor and sauces, and cotton cloth, to sell goods in front of various agricultural producers' cooperatives. In Jiading County's rural areas, twenty-five rural mobile supply teams supply four hundred kinds of goods. One supply team stationed in Xiaojiamiao would carry goods to the meeting place whenever nearby villages held meetings; when people's schools started, they would send notebooks, pencils, and literacy books to the schools; knowing that agricultural cooperatives wanted to set up clubs, they sent playing cards, chess sets, New Year pictures, and other recreational supplies; when the township set up wired broadcasting, they supplied cables and switches and helped with repairs. Many agricultural cooperative members and farmers passing the supply team on their way to the fields would leave empty bottles and baskets with the team, and buy goods to take back home when they returned. State-owned department stores in Wujiang and Liyang counties also organized cooperative vendors to set up stalls in agricultural producers' cooperatives at night. After deliverymen went to the countryside in Lüjia District, Kunshan County, many farmers saved time going to the towns to buy goods; preliminary estimates suggest this saves two thousand labor days each day. In the past, some farmers had to go to town to sell scrap iron and eggs, but now peddlers come to their doors to buy them.

Our correspondent in Wuhan reports that the state-owned and cooperative businesses in Hengdian District, Huangpi County, Hubei Province, led joint state-private businesses in organizing eight peddler teams selling groceries, food, cloth, general merchandise, pickles, and cigarettes, collectively delivering goods throughout the countryside. They are like a small mobile market, with a relatively complete range of goods. Farmers can buy what they need without delaying production time, which is very popular with farmers. On the first day they started collectively delivering goods, they sold more than 60 yuan worth in just half a day. The next day, based on the opinions of the masses, they added two more loads of straw sandals, ropes, candles, and Sichuan goods, and the turnover increased to 205 yuan.

    把商品送到农村去
    江苏各地国营百货公司和供销合作社，组织市镇公私合营商店和合作商店派人深入农村，送货上门，便利农民买货。
    苏州专区有六个县已经有南货、酒酱、棉布等十多个行业成立了送货小组，把货送到各个农业生产合作社的门前销售。嘉定县的农村中，有二十五个下乡巡回供应组供应着四百种商品。驻在肖家庙的一个供应组，每逢附近乡村开会，就把货担挑到会场；逢民校开学，就把写字簿、铅笔、识字本送到学校；他们知道农业合作社要办俱乐部，就送去扑克、象棋、年画等文娱用品；乡里办了有线广播，他们就供应皮线和开关，并且帮助修理。许多农业合作社社员和农民下田生产路过供应组的时候，把空瓶空篮存在组里，回家时就买了货带回去。吴江、溧阳等县国营百货公司，还组织合作商贩利用夜晚时间到农业生产合作社摆摊供应。昆山县绿葭区有送货员下乡以后，许多农民省去上市镇买货的时间，初步估计每天可以节省二千个劳动日。过去有些农民卖旧铁卖鸡蛋也要跑到镇上去，现在有货郎担上门来收购。

    湖北省黄陂县横店区国营、合作商业带领公私合营商业组织了杂货、食品、布匹、百货、酱菜、香烟等八个货郎担，集体送货串乡。他们像一个小型的流动市场，商品比较齐全，农民可以不耽误生产时间就能够买到需要的东西，农民非常欢迎。他们开始集体送货串乡的一天，只半天时间就卖了六十多元，第二天又根据群众的意见增加了草鞋、绳子、腊烛、川南货等两个担子，营业额增加到205元。
