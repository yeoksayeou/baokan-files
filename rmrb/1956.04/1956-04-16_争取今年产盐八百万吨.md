The salt production season has already begun in the four major coastal salt regions of Liaoning, Changlu, Shandong, and Huaibei. This year, salt industry workers across the country plan to produce more than eight million tons of salt, exceeding the 1957 production level.

The workers have already put forward reliable guarantees to complete this plan. Workers in the five salt-producing areas of Liaoning, Hangu, Tangda, Zigong, and Huaibei have put forward more than 6,600 rationalization proposals to increase production and quality, and improve equipment and operating methods in the socialist competition. The rationalization proposals made by workers in the Huaibei area have been integrated into seven measures. These measures can guarantee an increase in this year's output of more than 50% compared to the state plan. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    争取今年产盐八百万吨
    辽宁、长芦、山东、淮北四大海盐地区的产盐季节都已经开始了。今年，全国盐业职工计划要生产八百多万吨盐，将超过1957年的生产水平。
    职工们已经为完成这个计划提出了可靠的保证。辽宁、汉沽、塘大、自贡、淮北五个产盐地区职工，在社会主义竞赛当中提出了六千六百多件提高产量、质量，改进设备、操作方法的合理化建议。淮北地区职工提的合理化建议，已经被综合成七项措施。这些措施可以保证今年产量比国家计划增加50％以上。（据新华社讯）
