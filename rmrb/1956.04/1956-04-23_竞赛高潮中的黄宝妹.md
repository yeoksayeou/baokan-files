    Huang Baomei in the Climax of Competition
    Chen Fu
    Recently, the socialist competition in the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Factory has been in full swing for two months, with new achievements emerging one after another. Huang Baomei, the national model worker in the textile industry, is one of the most active participants in the competition, and has therefore become a role model for everyone to learn from.

    One morning in early February, the front page of the Shanghai Jiefang Daily published a news item: "Pu Yuzhen Catches Up with Huang Baomei!" This news shook all the textile workers in Shanghai.

    Huang Baomei heard the news while attending remedial classes at an evening school. At that time, what occupied her mind was no longer the scores and proportions that the teacher was talking about, but Pu Yuzhen! Many questions were churning in her mind. A national model worker in the textile industry! In the high tide of industrial production, she had fallen behind others. What should she do? She recalled a conversation she had with Zhang Qi, vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. Comrade Zhang Qi asked her: "If someone surpasses you, what should you do?" She said, "Humbly learn from her!" Comrade Zhang Qi said, "Yes, you should learn well, learn from each other's strengths and make up for your weaknesses, and use your exemplary actions to lead hundreds or thousands of workers into the ranks of advanced workers!"

    The next day, Huang Baomei led the sisters in her group to the fourth branch of the factory to find Pu Yuzhen. As soon as they met, a familiar figure flashed through Huang Baomei's mind. This petite and beautiful young female worker was actually the girl who had learned from Huang Baomei a year ago about piecing rovings, joining threads, winding the roller surface, and other work methods.

    Pu Yuzhen became nervous when she heard that Huang Baomei wanted to learn from her. In her mind, Huang Baomei was one of the best Hao Jianxiu work method experts in the factory, how could she be willing to learn from others? ... Before she could figure it out, Huang Baomei had already arrived in front of her. The administrator, Old Sun, seemed to see this and hurriedly said to Pu Yuzhen: "Yuzhen! Don't be afraid, just do it as usual."

    Pu Yuzhen tried her best to calm herself down, and according to her usual practice, she demonstrated the flexible segmentation method of cleaning work, one by one.

    Huang Baomei's eyes moved back and forth following Pu Yuzhen's performance. Suddenly, a yarn end broke beside Huang Baomei, and Pu Yuzhen was still doing cleaning work far away, and white cotton fibers were being released. Huang Baomei was about to run over to help Pu Yuzhen connect the broken end when a cleaning board came over, and Pu Yuzhen followed, connecting the broken end in one go. Then, at the place where the end was connected, Pu Yuzhen started cleaning work again...

    "Baomei, look, what is she going to do this time?" Cao Xiaomei said, pointing with her finger. Huang Baomei looked in the direction Cao Xiaomei was pointing, and there were two broken yarn ends not far from Pu Yuzhen. Pu Yuzhen was holding a roving in her hand, ready to change it onto the machine. Huang Baomei was worried for Pu Yuzhen. At this time, Pu Yuzhen also saw the two broken ends, she immediately dismissed the idea of changing the roving, and walked over in three steps and two steps, connected the two broken ends, and then went to change the roving onto the machine...

    The news that Huang Baomei was learning from Pu Yuzhen was as sensational as the news that Pu Yuzhen had caught up with Huang Baomei.

    However, not everyone learned smoothly when learning Pu Yuzhen's work method. Zhang Xiaomei became more and more confused when learning Pu Yuzhen's advanced experience, doing cleaning work that had already been done, and not doing what had not been done. Wan Xiaomei was also like this, unable to distinguish clearly whether the cleaning work had been done or not. Huang Baomei also encountered this difficulty. But he thought: To learn advanced experience, you must also use your brain, and you cannot simply copy it, but you must creatively and flexibly apply it.

    After several days of research, Huang Baomei came up with a method: He divided each spinning frame into twenty small sections according to the red paint marks on the spinning frame. In this way, when doing flexible segmentation of cleaning work, there would be no mistakes at all.

    Within a few days, all the workers in Huang Baomei's group quickly mastered Pu Yuzhen's advanced experience by following Huang Baomei's method.

    Recently, an interesting competition was launched in Huang Baomei's workshop.

    The goal of the competition is to do cleaning work. The one who does the best cleaning work will have the "cleanest" red flag inserted. On the first day of the evaluation, Huang Baomei confidently believed that the "cleanest" red flag must be inserted on her spinning frame. Unexpectedly, the "cleanest" red flag was inserted on Wan Xiaomei's spinning frame in the group. As soon as she got off work, Huang Baomei went to Wan Xiaomei's machine.

    "Wan Xiaomei! You have the red flag!"

    "? ! What if I have the red flag?!"

    "I'll come and see how you do cleaning work and learn from you!"

    Wan Xiaomei enthusiastically led Huang Baomei to visit her machine, gesticulating and telling Huang Baomei how to do cleaning work. Huang Baomei thought: Only by seeing others can you realize your own shortcomings. Advanced experience is not only available to model workers, but there is also a lot of advanced experience among the masses. Before leaving, she tightly held Wan Xiaomei's hand and said: "Let's compete!"

    In the second evaluation, Wan Xiaomei's "cleanest" red flag was inserted on Huang Baomei's machine. Since then, the "cleanest" red flag has been like throwing a colored ball, here today and there tomorrow. But the "cleanest" red flag inserted on Huang Baomei's machine was as stable as Mount Tai, nailed to the top.

    One day, not long after the whistle for getting off work sounded, the girls poured along the corridor to the washroom and changing room. Huang Baomei was about to leave when someone grabbed her arm. She turned her face to look and it turned out to be Liu Jumei, who lived across the alley from her machine.

    Liu Jumei is a smart young female worker, but she is usually very complacent. Huang Baomei had also heard that she was not convinced by Huang Baomei. This time, she suddenly took the initiative to come to her, which made Huang Baomei feel strange. Before Huang Baomei could speak, Liu Jumei had already grinned and said:

    "Baomei! I'm here to learn from you, are you willing to teach me?"

    Huang Baomei stared at her for a long time and said, "Are you joking or serious?"

    "Why isn't it true! Baomei, you are a national model worker in the textile industry, you can go to Pu Yuzhen to learn, why should I be embarrassed? I thought about this problem all night and couldn't even sleep well. I thought I must go to Baomei to learn. The sisters in our group are still waiting for me to learn well and teach them!" Liu Jumei said.

    "Okay! I'll teach you, you have to study hard!" Huang Baomei said excitedly.

    Huang Baomei watched Liu Jumei leave with a happy mood. She thought that in the high tide of the socialist revolution, people! have become more lovely. She walked into the washroom, washed her face, and with the joy after a day's labor, strode towards the evening school. (Attached picture)

    竞赛高潮中的黄宝妹
    陈夫  任务
    最近两个月，国营上海第十七棉纺织厂里的社会主义竞赛热火朝天，新的成就一个跟着一个出现。全国纺织劳动模范黄宝妹是竞赛中最活跃的一个，所以也就成为大家学习的榜样。
    二月初的一个早晨，上海解放日报第一版登载了一条新闻：“浦玉珍追上了黄宝妹！”这条新闻震动了全上海的纺织女工。
    黄宝妹是在业余学校里补课的时候听到这个消息的。当时，钻进她脑子里的已不是教员讲的分数和比例数，而是浦玉珍！她脑海里翻腾着许多问题。全国纺织劳动模范呵！在工业生产高潮中，落在别人后面了，怎么办呢？她想起同上海市工会联合会张琪副主席的一次谈话。张琪同志问她：“假如有人追过你，应该怎样？”她说：“虚心向她学习！”张琪同志说：“是的，应该很好地学习，取长补短，用你的模范行动带动上百个，上千个工人走进先进工作者的行列！”
    第二天，黄宝妹带领着小组的姊妹们到工厂的第四分厂去找浦玉珍。一见面，在黄宝妹的脑海里，就闪过了一个熟识的影子，这瘦小而漂亮的青年女工，原来正是在一年以前向黄宝妹学习过镶粗纱、接头，卷车面等工作法的那位姑娘。
    浦玉珍听到黄宝妹要来向她学习，就紧张起来。在她的心目中，黄宝妹是厂里数一数二的郝建秀工作法能手，怎肯向别人学习呢？……她还没想好，黄宝妹已经到了她面前了。管理员老孙似乎看出这一点，就急急忙忙地对浦玉珍说：“玉珍！不要怕，照着平常的样子做。”
    浦玉珍尽量把自己镇定下来，照着平常的做法，把清洁工作灵活分段的方法，一项项地表演出来。
    黄宝妹两只眼睛来回地跟着浦玉珍的表演转动着。忽然，在黄宝妹的身边有一根纱头断了，浦玉珍还在老远的地方做清洁工作，一条条的白花正在放出来。黄宝妹正想跑过去帮助浦玉珍接好这断头，一块擦板打过来了，浦玉珍也跟着走过来，一下子就把断头接好。接着，在接好头的地方，浦玉珍又做起清洁工作来了。
    “宝妹，你看，这一次，看她怎么办？”曹小妹用手指着说。黄宝妹顺着曹小妹指的地方看去，在离浦玉珍不远的地方，断了两根纱头。浦玉珍手里正拿着一只粗纱，准备换到车子上去。黄宝妹心里正替浦玉珍着急。这时候，浦玉珍也看见了这两根断头，她立刻打消了换粗纱的主意，三步两步走去，把两根断头接好后，才去把那只粗纱换到车子上去，……。
    黄宝妹向浦玉珍学习的消息，如同浦玉珍追上黄宝妹的消息一样轰动全厂。
    但是，在学习浦玉珍工作法的时候，并不是每一个人都学得很顺利。张小妹学习浦玉珍的先进经验，越做越糊涂，清洁工作做过了还做，没有做过的，却不去做。万小妹也是这样，清洁工作做过没做过，分不清爽，黄宝妹也碰到这个困难。但是他想：学习先进经验，也要开动脑筋，不能硬搬，要创造性地灵活地运用。
    经过几天的研究，黄宝妹想出了一个办法：他根据细纱车上一段段的红漆标记，把每台细纱车分成二十小段。这样，做清洁工作灵活分段法时，就一点也不会弄错了。
    没有过了几天，黄宝妹所在的小组工人，全都照着黄宝妹的方法，很快地掌握了浦玉珍的先进经验。
    最近黄宝妹所在的车间，开展了一个有趣的竞赛。
    竞赛的目标是做清洁工作，那一个清洁工作做得最好的，便插上“最清洁”的红旗，第一天评比时，黄宝妹满有信心地以为 “最清洁”的红旗一定插在她的纺车上。结果出她意料之外，“最清洁”的红旗插在小组里的万小妹纺车上。一下班，黄宝妹到万小妹的车床上去。
    “万小妹！你插上红旗啦！”
    “?！插上红旗怎么？！”
    “我来看看，你怎样做清洁工作的，向你学习！”
    万小妹热情地领着黄宝妹去参观她的车床，比划着告诉黄宝妹怎样做清洁工作。黄宝妹心里想：看看人家才发觉自己的不够，先进经验不但劳动模范有，群众中先进经验也满多。她临走时紧紧的握住万小妹的手说：“我们俩人来竞赛吧！”
    第二次评比的时候，万小妹的“最清洁”红旗，插到黄宝妹车床上了。从此以后，“最清洁”的红旗，像抛彩球似的，今天在这里，明天在那里。但是插在黄宝妹车床上的那面“最清洁”的红旗，稳如泰山般钉住在上面。
    有一天下班的汽笛拉过不久，姑娘们都沿着通道涌向洗脸间和更衣室。黄宝妹正要走时，有一个人在她的手臂上抓一把。她转脸过来一看，原来是和她车弄堂对过的刘菊妹。
    刘菊妹是个聪明的青年女工，但平时很自满。黄宝妹也听到过她对黄宝妹不服气的消息。这次她突然主动找上门来，倒使黄宝妹奇怪起来。不等黄宝妹开口，刘菊妹已经咧开嘴笑着说：
    “宝妹！我来向你学习，你肯教我吗？”
    黄宝妹盯着她看了好久说：“你是开玩笑，还是真的？”
    “怎么不是真的！宝妹，你是全国纺织劳动模范，你都能够去向浦玉珍学习，我为啥还怕难为情呢？我为这个问题想了一个晚上，连觉都没睡好，我想我一定要去向宝妹学习。我们小组的姐妹还等着我学好回去教她们哩！”刘菊妹说。
    “好好！我教你，你要好好学！”黄宝妹兴奋地说。
    黄宝妹怀着愉快的心情目送着刘菊妹出去。她想着，在社会主义革命高潮中，人！变得更可爱了。她走进洗脸间洗完脸，带着一天劳动后的愉快，跨着矫健的步伐，向业余学校走去。（附图片）
