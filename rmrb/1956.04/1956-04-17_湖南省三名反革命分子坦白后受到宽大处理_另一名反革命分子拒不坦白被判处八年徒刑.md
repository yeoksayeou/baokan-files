According to the policy of "leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist," the Hunan Provincial People's Procuratorate and the Hunan Provincial Higher People's Court leniently treated three counter-revolutionaries, Xiao Yaorong, Xiong Jizhao, and Situ Daosheng, who confessed their crimes on the 7th, and severely punished the counter-revolutionary Wang Hongfu who refused to confess. The counter-revolutionaries who received lenient treatment were exempted from prosecution and remained in their original units. The counter-revolutionary Wang Hongfu, who refused to confess, was sentenced to eight years in prison.

Xiao Yaorong joined the Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau (CC Clique) spy organization in October 1937 and successively served as a puppet township chief, self-defense brigade captain, and secretary of the Kuomintang district branch. In the early days of liberation, he collected information on troops stationed in and passing through Chaling County and reported it to secret agents. At the same time, he and Kuomintang Military Statistics Bureau (Blue Shirts Society) agent Li Suoxiang organized the so-called "CPC Chaling Branch" in an attempt to infiltrate the Communist Party. In 1952, Xiao Yaorong wormed his way into the Hunan Provincial Company of the China Monopoly Business Corporation.

Xiong Jizhao joined the CC Clique spy organization in 1944 while at Hunan Business College. In the autumn of the same year, he served as the leader of the CC Clique party network group in the school, successively developing six students as CC Clique network members, monitoring the activities of progressive professors and students, and frequently reporting to the CC Clique's Xiangxi Regional Office. In the autumn of 1945, Xiong served as an assistant clerk at the Chongqing CC Clique headquarters. Before the liberation of Changsha, Xiong spread rumors among students to undermine the "welcoming liberation" movement. After liberation, he spread rumors to threaten our rural cadres and undermine rent reduction and deposit refunds. In the spring of 1951, Xiong also tipped off another counter-revolutionary who should have been arrested, prompting him to flee. In 1952, Xiong sneaked into the Hunan Provincial Water Conservancy Department to work.

The active secret agent Situ Daosheng joined the Kuomintang "Central Committee Second Group" spy organization in Hong Kong in August 1953. In September of the same year, he received a sum of money from the U.S.-Chiang secret service and sneaked into Guangzhou Municipal Second Middle School. Soon, he developed classmates Mai Shubiao and You Guohao to join the spy organization and sent intelligence to the U.S.-Chiang secret service in Hong Kong six times. In the spring of 1954, he led Mai Shubiao to Hong Kong twice, on the one hand, to send intelligence to the secret service and receive further training; at the same time, he handed over the exit permit issued by the People's Government to the secret service for reproduction. As a result, Situ Daosheng was promoted to "liaison commissioner" by the U.S.-Chiang secret service. In August 1954, when Situ Daosheng came to Hunan Medical College to study from Guangzhou, he engaged in reactionary activities such as spreading rumors and sowing discord.

The above-mentioned Xiao Yaorong, Xiong Jizhao, Situ Daosheng and other three counter-revolutionaries all confessed their spy identities and counter-revolutionary crimes in this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, the Hunan Provincial People's Procuratorate, in accordance with the policy of "leniency for those who confess," exempted them from prosecution. Xiao Yaorong and Xiong Jizhao are now remaining in their original units to work. Situ Daosheng is still studying at Hunan Medical College.

Another counter-revolutionary, Wang Hongfu, served as the chairman of the Youth Party Preparatory Office in Huarong County in 1947. In August 1948, he joined the Kuomintang CC Clique spy organization in Huarong County and, together with CC Clique agent Lu Renfeng, arrested three so-called "suspects" under the pretext of checking household registrations. After liberation, Wang Hongfu sneaked into the Huarong County Tax Bureau and colluded with Youth Party members Cao Haishan and others to steal and sell slaughter tax stamps, disrupting tax collection. In this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, he refused to confess and prevented other counter-revolutionaries from confessing. The Hunan Provincial Higher People's Court, in accordance with the policy of "severity for those who conceal," has sentenced Wang Hongfu to eight years of imprisonment.

    湖南省三名反革命分子坦白后受到宽大处理
    另一名反革命分子拒不坦白被判处八年徒刑
    湖南省人民检察院和湖南省高级人民法院根据“坦白从宽、抗拒从严”的政策，在七日宽大处理了坦白了自己罪行的萧耀荣、熊继昭、司徒道生三名反革命分子，严肃地惩处了拒不坦白的反革命分子王洪富。被宽大处理的反革命分子都免于起诉，仍留原单位，拒不坦白的反革命分子王洪富被判处八年徒刑。
    萧耀荣在1937年10月就参加国民党中统特务组织，历任伪乡长、自卫大队长、国民党区分部书记等职。解放初期，他又曾搜集驻茶陵县城和过境部队的情况向特务分子汇报，同时又和国民党军统特务李琐祥等组织了所谓“中共茶陵支部”，企图钻入共产党内。1952年，萧耀荣钻进了中国专卖事业公司湖南省公司工作。
    熊继昭1944年在湖南商学院时就参加了中统特务组织，同年秋天担任这个学校的中统党网小组长，先后发展了六个学生为中统网员，监视进步教授和学生的活动，并常向中统湘西区室汇报。1945年秋，熊曾在重庆中统局局本部任助理干事。长沙解放前夕，熊在学生中散布谣言，破坏“迎接解放”运动。解放后又造谣威胁我乡村干部，破坏减租退押。1951年春熊还为另一应予逮捕的反革命分子通风报信，促使其逃跑。1952年，熊混入湖南省水利厅工作。
    现行特务分子司徒道生是1953年8月在香港加入国民党“中委会二组”特务组织的。同年九月他领取了美蒋特务机关给他的一笔经费后潜入广州市立第二中学。不久，他就发展了同学麦树标、游国浩加入特务组织，并且向香港的美蒋特务机关送了六次情报。1954年春他曾带领麦树标去香港两次，一方面向特务机关送情报，并再次接受特务训练；同时将人民政府发给的出境通行证交给特务机关翻印。因此，司徒道生被美蒋特务机关提升为“联络专员”。1954年8月，司徒道生由广州来湖南医学院学习时，又进行造谣、挑拨离间等反动活动。
    以上萧耀荣、熊继昭、司徒道生等三名反革命分子在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，都坦白了自己的特务身份和反革命罪行。因此湖南省人民检察院根据“坦白从宽”的政策，免予起诉。现在萧耀荣、熊继昭仍留原单位工作。司徒道生仍在湖南医学院学习。
    另一名反革命分子王洪富，1947年曾任青年党华容县筹备处主席，1948年8月在华容县加入国民党中统特务组织，并和中统特务分子卢人凤等以检查户口为名，逮捕了所谓“嫌疑分子”三名。解放后，王洪富混入华容县税务局，曾勾结青年党党羽曹海珊等盗卖屠宰税标底，破坏税收。这次肃清反革命分子斗争中，他拒不坦白，并阻止其他反革命分子坦白交代。湖南省高级人民法院根据“隐瞒从严”的政策，已将王洪富判处有期徒刑八年。　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
