Improving the Financial Accounting Work of Agricultural Cooperatives
Wei Guangping, Luo Hanyun

The Nanchong Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sichuan Province attaches importance to strengthening leadership in improving the financial accounting work of agricultural production cooperatives. Currently, all 21,000-plus cooperatives in the region have established formal account books for their accounting work. These cooperatives have also strengthened preparations for spring plowing production by formulating financial revenue and expenditure plans and material supply plans.

In what aspects has the Nanchong Prefectural Committee improved its leadership over the financial accounting work of agricultural cooperatives?

I. Establishing and improving financial accounting guidance organizations and strengthening guidance work. Leadership organs at all levels throughout the region have established financial accounting guidance organizations, with a certain number of full-time counselors. The Rural Work Department of the Prefectural Committee has five full-time counselors, the Rural Work Department of the County Committee generally has three to five full-time counselors, and each district and township has one full-time counselor. To strengthen the guidance force, the prefecture, county, district, and township also hired cadres familiar with accounting business from financial departments (banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, tax bureaus, grain bureaus) to serve as part-time counselors (five in the prefecture, five to seven in the county, three to five in the district, and one to two in the township), and organized accounting guidance groups. To create experience and guide the overall situation, the prefecture, county, and district have established key townships, and the township has established key cooperatives. Full-time and part-time counselors directly contact one cooperative to accumulate experience and guide the work of other cooperatives. In addition to assisting new cooperatives in establishing accounts and old cooperatives in advance distribution and final distribution, part-time counselors generally participate in financial accounting guidance work for five to seven days each month. To make guidance work regular, various places have also established regular meeting, reporting, and business study systems.

II. Organizing accounting mutual aid groups and running accounting night schools to improve the business level of accountants. Although all the accountants in the region have received training, many cooperative accountants still have weak business capabilities. To help these accountants become familiar with the business, in addition to short-term training courses organized by the county and district, accounting mutual aid groups have been established based on the distance between cooperatives and the strength of the accountants' capabilities. These groups collectively check and record accounts every five days, and some also adopt joint accounting office methods to help each other. For accountants with particularly weak capabilities, strong accountants are assigned to help them using the master-apprentice method. In addition, permanent accounting night schools are established with the joint association as the unit (five to seven cooperatives), and accounting staff, cashiers, custodians, work point recorders, and young activists are recruited to participate. More than 3,000 accounting night schools have been established throughout the prefecture, and learning generally began around February 15th. The accounting night schools are headed and taught by two accountants with strong capabilities. The learning content is determined according to the business level of the students and the content of each stage of work. For example, many work point recorders and cashiers cannot write Arabic numerals or use decimal points. For these people, learning Arabic numerals and placing decimal points is the first lesson. When old cooperatives close their accounts and new cooperatives establish their accounts, accountants focus on learning accounting subjects and learning accounting and transfer methods. Because the learning content is concentrated and closely integrated with current work, the teaching effect is very good.

III. Promoting unified account books, manuals, forms, and work cards, and establishing a simple and easy-to-implement, relatively standardized financial accounting system. In the past, due to the inconsistent forms of account books, some cooperative accounts were too complicated, which caused great difficulties for accountants in establishing accounts. To change this situation, the Nanchong Prefectural Committee promoted unified account books with relatively simple classifications. Currently, cooperatives only set up four account books: namely, journal, general ledger, detailed sub-ledger, and labor work point ledger. Four registers are set up: namely, land share capital register, inventory register, fixed asset register, and product register. Two manuals were issued to members, one is a labor manual recording the work points of the members, and the other is a member economic exchange manual recording the economic exchanges of members such as land, shares, production investment, temporary advances, and pre-distribution. Members generally responded very well after adopting these two manuals. In addition, four systems have been formulated for expenditure approval, vouchers, account inspection and publication, and material cash custody. In this way, the financial accounting work of agricultural cooperatives has been initially improved.

    改进农业合作社的财务会计工作
    卫广平、罗汗云
    中共四川省南充地委重视改进农业生产合作社财务会计工作的领导。目前全区二万一千多个合作社在会计工作方面都建立了正式账簿；这些社还通过制定财务收支计划和物资供应计划，加强了春耕生产准备工作。
    南充地委从哪些方面改进了对农业社财务会计工作的领导呢？
    一、建立和健全财务会计辅导组织，加强辅导工作。全地区各级领导机关都建立了财会辅导组织，设有一定数量的专职辅导员。地委农村工作部设专职辅导员五人，县委农村工作部一般设有专职辅导员三至五人，区、乡各设专职辅导员一人，为了壮大辅导力量，专区、县、区、乡还从财经部门（银行、供销社、税务局、粮食局）聘请了熟悉会计业务的干部担任兼职辅导员（专区五人，县五至七人，区三至五人，乡一至二人），组织会计辅导组。为了创造经验，指导全面，专、县、区都建立了重点乡，乡设立了重点社，专职和兼职辅导员都直接联系一个社，积累经验，指导其他社的工作。各地兼职辅导员除担任帮助新社建账、老社预支分配、分配决算等任务外，一般每月以五至七天参加财会辅导工作。为了使辅导工作经常化，各地还建立了定期的会议、汇报、业务学习等制度。
    二、组织会计互助组，举办会计夜校，提高会计业务水平。全地区的会计虽然都受过训练，但是现在仍有不少社的会计业务能力较弱。为了帮助这批会计熟悉业务，除由县、区举办短期训练班外，还根据社的距离远近，会计能力强弱，建立了会计互助组。这些组每五天集体查账记账一次，有的还采取会计联合办公方法，相互帮助。对于能力特别弱的会计，就固定由强的会计，用师傅带徒弟的办法进行帮助。此外，又以联社为单位
  （五个至七个社）成立常年会计夜校，吸收会计员、出纳员、保管员、记工员和青年积极分子参加。现在全专区已经建立了会计夜校三千多个，普遍于二月十五日左右开始了学习。会计夜校都以能力强的会计二人担任校长和教员。学习内容是根据学员的业务程度和每段的工作内容来决定。如有很多记工员、出纳员写不来阿拉伯字，不会用小数点，对这些人就以学习阿拉伯字和打小数点作为第一课。在老社结账、新社建账的时候，会计员就着重学习会计科目，学习记账、转账方法。由于学习内容集中，又同当前工作紧密结合，教学效果很好。
    三、推行统一的账簿、手册、表格和工牌，建立简便易行的比较正规的财务会计制度。过去由于账簿形式不统一，有的社账目太复杂，给会计建账造成很大困难。为了改变这种情况，南充地委推行了分类比较简单的统一的账簿。目前合作社只设置了四本账：即日记账、分类账、明细分户账、劳动工分账。设置了四个登记簿：即土地股金登记簿、库存物资登记簿、固定财产登记簿、产品登记簿。给社员发了两个手册，一是记载社员做工分的劳动手册，一是记载社员入社土地、股金、生产投资、临时借支、预分等经济往来账目的社员经济往来手册。采用这两个手册以后，社员普遍反映很好。此外，还制定了开支审批、单据、账目检查公布、物资现金保管等四个制度。这样就初步改善了农业合作社的财务会计工作。
