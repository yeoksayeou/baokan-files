    Preparations for the restoration project of the Bisezhai to Hekou section (border with Vietnam) of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway are actively underway.
    The Bisezhai section of the railway is 177 kilometers long. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, almost all the large and medium-sized bridges on the entire line were destroyed. Other facilities, such as stations, communications, and locomotive services, also need to be rebuilt. (Yunnan Daily Editorial Department)
