Xinhua News Agency, London, April 13th (TASS dispatch): British Prime Minister Eden stated in the House of Commons on the 12th, in response to questions regarding the upcoming visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain, that the British government attaches great importance to discussing "the problems that divide the world" during the visit. At the same time, he also said that plans are in place to give the Soviet leaders the opportunity to interact with the British people and understand the British way of life.

Eden said he welcomed the Soviet leaders' contact with the British people. He said it would be better if the people of both countries had the opportunity to interact with each other. Eden said he hoped this would be one of the results of the Soviet leaders' visit.

Labour MP Henderson expressed hope that the Soviet leaders would have "wide opportunities to contact non-official persons."

Conservative MP Peyton said the Prime Minister should be careful not to allow the visit to be used for "communist propaganda."

Labour leader Gaitskell said it was right that the Prime Minister attached great importance to conducting serious discussions. Gaitskell said that, at the same time, Labour MPs were puzzled by the fact that the government seemed to have rejected the guests' request to visit an enterprise during their visit.

Gaitskell quoted a TASS report that expressed regret that there would be no opportunity to visit an enterprise during the visit. Gaitskell emphasized that there was a "danger of misunderstanding" on this issue.

In reply to Gaitskell, Eden said that the itinerary included arrangements for the guests to visit the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment and the Calder Hall atomic power station, which is under construction.

    艾登谈苏联领导人访英问题
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社伦敦讯：英国首相艾登十二日在下院答复关于布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫即将访问英国的问题的时候，重申英国政府十分重视在访问的时期内讨论“使得世界分歧的问题”。同时他还说，计划让苏联领导人有机会同英国人民接触，了解英国的生活方式。
    艾登说，他欢迎苏联领导人同英国人民进行接触。他说，如果两国人民有机会彼此接触，那就更好了。艾登说，他希望这将是苏联领导人访问的成果之一。
    工党议员汉德逊表示，希望苏联领导人能有“广泛的机会同非官方人士接触”。
    保守党议员佩顿说，首相应当当心，不要让这次访问被利用来进行“共产主义宣传”。
    工党领袖盖次克尔说，首相十分重视进行认真的讨论，这是对的。盖次克尔说，同时，工党议员感到迷惑的是，政府似乎拒绝了客人们提出的在他们访问期间参观一个企业的要求。
    盖次克尔引了塔斯社的一条消息，这条消息对于在访问的时候没有机会参观企业表示遗憾。盖次克尔着重指出，在这个问题上存在着“误解的危险”。
    艾登答复盖次克尔的时候说，在访问日程中替客人们安排好访问原子能研究中心哈威尔和正在建筑原子电力站的考尔德豪尔。
