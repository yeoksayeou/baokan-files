    Creatively Learn Advanced Experiences

    The tunneling team led by Bai Shuanbao of the Longyan Iron Mine is an industrial model group that has been rated as a model at the factory, city, and provincial levels for five consecutive years. This team completed the workload of the first four years of the Five-Year Plan in August 1955 and is now striving to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in May of this year.

    Humbly and creatively learning from advanced experiences is a characteristic of this team. They have learned many advanced experiences from the Ma Wan Shui team and, on this basis, created the "double wedge-shaped cross-cut method," applying it to tunnels of different rock types. Using this method, the efficiency is increased by 10% in the tunneling of ore seam roadways and by 71.4% in the tunneling of quartzite roadways.

    Over the past few years, this team has tunneled through seven of the most important and arduous working environment roadways. In the level tunnel task, the water depth of the roadway reached four decimeters, and the rock was all grade one quartzite, which was extremely hard. The workers stood in the water to work and also encountered quicksand faults. However, with strong will, the workers overcame the faults and completed the task ahead of schedule.

    This team also often supports fraternal teams, introducing their experiences to other teams. In the past year alone, they helped five teams that had been failing to meet their plans for a long time to overfulfill their plans month by month. With their help, some teams have also become advanced teams.

    创造性地学习先进经验
    龙烟铁矿白拴宝领导的掘进小组，是一个连续五年被评为厂、市、省的工业模范小组。这个小组在1955年8月就完成了五年计划前四年的工作量，现在正争取在今年五月份提前完成第一个五年计划。
    虚心地创造性地学习先进经验，是这个小组的特点。他们曾学习了马万水小组的许多先进经验，并在这个基础上创造了“双楔形交叉掏槽法”，把它使用到不同的岩种巷道上去。用这种方法，在矿层巷道的掘进中，提高效率10％；在石英岩巷道掘进中，提高效率71.4％。
    几年来，这个小组共凿通了七处最重要的工作环境最艰苦的巷道。在平窿任务中，巷道水深达四公寸，岩石又都是一级石英岩，非常坚硬。工人们站在水里工作，又遇到流砂断层。但是，工人们以坚强的意志，渡过了断层，提前完成了任务。
    这个小组还常支援兄弟小组，把自己的经验介绍给别的小组。在去年一年内，他们就帮助了五个长期完不成计划的小组逐月超额完成了计划，有的小组还在他们的帮助下，成为先进小组。
