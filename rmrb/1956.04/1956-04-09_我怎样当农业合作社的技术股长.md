How I Became the Technology Head of an Agricultural Cooperative
Wang Yunsheng

I am the technology head of the Xizhanggeng Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province. Now I will talk about how I became a technology head.

When I first became a production committee member, I felt the pain of not having technical knowledge. I mobilized the masses for deep plowing, and the masses asked me what the benefits of deep plowing were, but I couldn't explain it clearly. I mobilized the masses to select seeds in the fields, and the masses said that field selection was not as good as selection in the farm. I couldn't explain the reasoning, so I could only say, "This is the call of the higher authorities, it's right." Later, the members elected me as the technology head of the cooperative. Whether the cooperative's production can increase significantly, whether the members' income can rise faster, and whether the cooperative can be quickly consolidated are all related to my technical work. From then on, I resolved to study technology and become an expert. My education level is low, and I have many difficulties in learning. I thought that as long as I have the determination, I am not afraid of not learning well. If I don't understand, I ask the technicians, ask experienced members, or consult books. If I still can't understand or figure it out, I will do experiments myself. I often travel twenty or thirty *li* to the county farm and the special district farm to study in order to figure out a problem. I now have more than 400 technical books at home. The work is very busy, how can I read so many books? I mainly read books for one or two hours every night. I often carry a book with me, and read a few lines or pages whenever I have time. At present, I have some understanding of common technologies in wheat, cotton, miscellaneous grains, oil crops, disease and pest control and machinery, soil, fertilizer, varieties, as well as horticulture and animal husbandry, and I can apply them specifically.

Since 1954, tractors have been used in our township. I began to pay attention to studying the new technical problems after the implementation of mechanized production. For example, using a seeder, one machine can sow 300 *mu* in ten hours a day. The existing twenty-four machines can sow 7,200 *mu* a day; but using the original seed mixer is not feasible, and two people can only mix more than 500 *jin* a day. I saw the diagram and description of the "gravity seed mixer" in the book "Wheat Disease and Pest Control". With it, two people can mix more than 9,000 *jin* of seeds a day, so I actively tried to imitate it, and made four, giving two to the county farm and the special district farm, and keeping two in our cooperative. After using mechanical seed mixing, the original constant-temperature soaking of cotton seeds is also not feasible. Not only is it inefficient, but also to catch up with machine sowing, it is necessary to increase a lot of soaking equipment, such as urns, pots, sieves, etc., which would cost a lot of money to buy. Therefore, I plan to suggest that the cooperative adopt the cotton seed smothering method introduced by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps this year. With this method, two people can smother more than 4,000 *jin* of seeds a day, which is three times more efficient than the past constant-temperature soaking. In order to meet the needs of mechanized mass production, I also want to start promoting early-maturing foreign wheat and short-fruit branch cotton this year. These excellent varieties not only have high yields and good quality, but are also easy for machine cultivation.

Implementing technical innovations often encounters obstacles from conservative thinking. When encountering this situation, I patiently publicize on the one hand, and do experiments first for everyone to see on the other hand. Last year, our cooperative had 400 *mu* of dryland cotton, with a density of 5,000 plants per *mu*. Later, due to drought, coupled with poor labor allocation and technical operations not keeping up, flower and boll shedding occurred. At this time, the cooperative staff and members complained that they should not have planted so densely. So I suggested to the cooperative committee to organize some staff to visit the special district farm. The special district farm had a maximum of 6,000 plants of dryland cotton, which grew very vigorously, and it was estimated that each *mu* could harvest 600-700 *jin* of cotton. At that time, it was found that the main reason for the flower and boll shedding of cotton in our cooperative was less cultivation and insufficient pruning. Only then did everyone believe that it was not excessive planting density.

When I promote relatively important technical measures, I first study with the Party branch, obtain the consent of the branch, and then submit it to the cooperative management committee for discussion and approval. The technical measures such as ridge plowing in early spring, winter irrigation of cotton fields, and artificial pollination of corn, which were implemented last year, were all done in this way. Last winter, the cooperative formulated this year's production increase plan for cotton and wheat crops: 210 *jin* per *mu* for wheat, 400 *jin* per *mu* for cotton in irrigated land, and 250 *jin* per *mu* for cotton in dryland. Later, I saw the experience of large-scale bumper harvests of cotton from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in the "China Agricultural Newspaper" (No. 23, 1955). I studied it in combination with the specific situation of our cooperative and felt that our cooperative's production increase plan was too conservative. I raised my opinions to the management committee for study. But I didn't have a definite grasp, so I went to the county farm and the special district farm to study again. The county farm and the special district farm believed that my opinion was basically correct and gave me some new opinions. I rushed back to the cooperative management committee to study soon after. At first, the management committee members thought that the production increase plan I proposed was too rash. I made a detailed explanation of the complete set of technical measures to be taken and the possible conditions for promoting these measures. Finally, I made an account of cotton dense planting: for example, dryland cotton has 8,000 plants per *mu*, and each plant is calculated as having six fruit branches, with one peach per fruit branch, then each plant has six peaches; each *mu* has 48,000 peaches, calculated at 120 peaches per *jin* of seed cotton. A total of 400 *jin* of seed cotton can be picked (all calculated according to the minimum). After deducting 100 *jin* of loss (calculated according to the maximum loss), 300 *jin* are left. Finally, everyone accepted my opinion and revised the original plan: the average yield of wheat per *mu* is 250 *jin*, the average yield of cotton per *mu* in irrigated land is 700 *jin* (seed cotton), and the average yield of cotton per *mu* in dryland is 300 *jin* (seed cotton).

To be a good technology head, it is also necessary to give full play to the role of the technical organization. Our cooperative's technical organization system is: head, members, team leaders, technicians. We have formulated a set of inspection, liaison, commendation, and criticism systems; implemented a division of labor responsibility system: the team leader reports every five days, each team conducts cotton and wheat experiments on five *fen* of land, mainly the team leader is responsible, the deputy team leader is mainly responsible for technical guidance, and the technicians work with the masses to implement and publicize new technologies. After the cooperative committee formulates a technical measure, we implement it in three or four days, and ensure that it is clearly explained to the masses to avoid mistakes. The promotion of each new technology must be based on the principle of saving as much as possible, and the cost must be calculated in advance to avoid extravagance and waste.

I feel that to be a technology head, you must have technical knowledge in many aspects. In 1952, the village bought back 32 horses, and soon two or three of them became ill. After Wang Yuzhang's horse became ill, he went to me for a solution. I didn't understand, and I couldn't find a veterinarian, so the horse died in two or three days. From then on, I bought some animal husbandry books to study. Later, the cooperative bought back two "Yorkshire" pigs, and the masses worriedly said, "It is easy to feed pigs, but difficult to raise pigs." So I bought eight books on pig feeding, breeding, diseases, etc. This technical knowledge really came in handy. Now the two pigs in our cooperative not only grow very well, but have also bred 513 pigs in the past two or three years, and have also mated 137 sows in other villages. Last year, many pigs died in other villages, but no pigs died in our village. Of course, the operating departments of cooperatives are becoming more and more diverse, and it is far from enough to rely on the limited technology of a few technicians to solve problems. Therefore, we plan to start this year to cultivate eight kinds of specialized talents in the middle school class of the technical night school, so that they have specialized technical knowledge. In a few years, the general technical problems in our cooperative can basically be solved by our own specialized talents.

    我怎样当农业合作社的技术股长
    王运升
    我是山西省解虞县西张耿乡农业生产合作社的技术股长，现在谈一谈我是怎样当技术股长的。
    开始当生产委员的时候，我就感到了没有技术的苦恼。我动员群众深耕，群众问我深耕有什么好处，我说不清楚。我动员群众田间选种，群众说田间选种没有场里选种好，我说不出道理，只好说一句：“这是上级的号召，没错。”后来，社员们又选我当社里的技术股长。社的生产能不能增加得很多，社员的收入能不能上升得更快，社能不能迅速地巩固，这些都和我的技术工作有关系。从此，我决心要钻研技术，变成内行。我的文化程度低，学习中困难很多。我想，只要自己有决心，不怕学不好。自己不懂就问技术人员、问有经验的社员，或者向书本请教。如果还弄不通想不透，自己就作实验。我常常为了弄清一个问题，跑上二、三十里路到县农场和专区农场去研究。我家里的技术书籍现在已有四百多本。工作忙的很，这么多的书怎么看呢？我主要是在每天黑夜看一、两个钟头的书。我经常随身带一本书，一有空就看它几行或几页。目前我对小麦、棉花、杂粮、油料、病虫防治和药械、土壤、肥料、品种以及园艺、畜牧等各方面的普通技术都懂得了一些，并且能够具体运用了。
    从1954年起，我们乡里使用上拖拉机了。我开始注意研究实行机械化生产后技术上的新问题。比如用播种机播种，一架机器一天工作十小时能播种三百亩。现有的二十四架，一天能播种七千二百亩；但是用原来的拌种器拌种就不行了，两个人一天只能拌五百多斤。我在“麦类病虫防治”一书上看到“重力拌种机”的图样和说明，用它一天两个人能拌种九千多斤，我就积极设法仿造，结果制成四个，给了县农场和专区农场两个，我们社里留了两个。用机械拌种后，原来的棉籽定温浸种也不行了，它不但效率低，而且用它要赶上机器播种需要，就得增加许多浸种设备，如瓮啦，锅啦，筛子啦等等，买它得花许多钱。因此，我准备建议社里今年采用新疆生产部队介绍的棉籽闷种法，用这办法两个人一天能闷种四千多斤，比过去的定温浸种效率提高三倍。为了适合机械化大生产的需要，我还想在今年开始推广早洋麦和短果枝棉，这些优良品种不但产量高、质量好，而且也便于机器中耕。
    实行技术上的革新，常常会碰到保守思想的阻碍。碰到这种情况，我就一方面耐心地宣传，另一方面先作试验让大家看。去年我们社里有四百亩旱地棉花，每亩作了五千株的密植。后来因为天旱，再加劳力调配不好，技术操作赶不上去，所以发生了落蕾落铃现象。这时社的工作人员、社员们都埋怨原来不该密植那么多。于是我就建议社务委员会，组织了一些工作人员到专区农场去参观，专区农场的旱地棉花最多的是六千株，长得很旺盛，预计每亩可收棉六、七百斤。当时，检查出我们社里棉花落蕾落铃的主要原因是中耕少，整枝打槎不够，这样大家才相信不是密植过多。
    我在推广比较重要的技术措施的时候，都是先和党支部研究，取得支部的同意，再交到社务管理委员会讨论通过。去年推行的顶凌耙地、棉田冬季灌溉、玉米人工授粉等技术措施，都是这样做的。去年冬季社里订了今年的棉麦作物增产计划：小麦每亩产210斤，棉花，水地每亩产400斤，旱地每亩产250斤。后来我在中国农报（1955年第23期）上看到新疆生产部队的棉花大面积丰产的经验，我就结合我们社的具体情况作了研究，觉得自己社里的增产计划太保守了，我把我的意见提到管理委员会上去研究。但是我又没有确实的把握，于是又到县农场和专区农场去研究。县农场和专区农场认为我的意见基本上正确，并且给我补充了一些新的意见。我回去后很快就赶到社务管理委员会去研究。开始，管理委员们认为我提出的增产计划太冒进了。我把需要采取的整套技术措施和推行这些措施的可能条件，做了详细的说明。最后我又就棉花密植算了一笔账：比如旱地棉花每亩密植八千株，每株按结六个果枝、每个果枝一个桃计算，每株就有六个桃；每亩有四万八千个桃，按120个桃顶一斤籽棉计算。共可摘四百斤籽棉（以上都按最少的计算）。除掉一百斤损耗（按最大损耗计算），还落三百斤。最后大家终于接受了我的意见，修订了原来的计划：小麦每亩平均产250斤，水地棉花每亩平均产七百斤（籽棉），旱地棉花每亩平均产三百斤（籽棉）。
    要当好技术股长，还必须很好地发挥技术组织的作用。我们合作社的技术组织系统是：股长、股员、组长、技术员。我们订了一套检查、联系、表扬、批评的制度；实行分工负责制：组长每五天汇报一次，每个队作五分地的棉麦试验，主要由组长负责，副组长主要是作好技术辅导，技术员要同群众一块去贯彻宣传新技术。社务委员会订出一项技术措施以后，我们在三、四天之内贯彻下去，而且保证向群众交代清楚，避免错误。每件新技术的推广，必须本着尽量节约的原则，事先计算好成本，避免铺张浪费。
    我觉得作一个技术股长，必须有多方面的技术知识。1952年，村里买回来32匹马，不久就有两三匹病了。王玉章的马病了以后，就去找我想办法，我不懂，一下又找不到兽医，结果两三天马就死了。从那时起，我买了一些畜牧方面的书学习。后来社里买回两口“约克夏”猪，群众担心地说：“喂猪容易养猪难。”于是我就买了八本关于猪的喂养、繁殖、疾病等方面的书。这些技术知识真的用上了。现在我们社的那两口猪，不但长得很好，并且二、三年来已经繁殖了513口猪，另外还给其他村交配了137口母猪。去年别的村的猪死亡很多，但是我们村却没有死一口猪。当然，合作社经营的部门越来越多样，永远靠几个技术人员的有限的技术来解决问题，是十分不够的。所以，我们计划从今年开始，在技术夜校的中学班培养八种专门人材，使他们有专门的技术知识。再过几年，我们社里的一般技术问题，基本上可以依靠我们自己的专门人材来解决了。
