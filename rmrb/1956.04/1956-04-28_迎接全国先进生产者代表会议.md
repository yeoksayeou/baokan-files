    Welcoming the National Conference of Advanced Producers
    People of the Capital Welcome Advanced Figures
    In front of the Beijing Railway Station square, an eleven-meter-high red sign tower has been erected, with the large gold characters "Celebrating the Opening of the National Conference of Advanced Producers" inscribed on it. Over the past few days, the station's staff has received thousands of representatives from all over the country coming to Beijing; they have also prepared beautiful lounges in the waiting room for the representatives coming to Beijing.
    Similarly, some tall sign towers have also been erected on Beijing's bustling streets and public places. Many street walls and store windows are also plastered with propaganda posters and colorful slogans celebrating the conference. Some slogans read: "Everyone strives to be an advanced producer, learn from advanced producers!" "Salute to the advanced producers who dedicate their wisdom to the motherland!"
    Most of the city's workers' clubs and cinemas have begun to show propaganda posters related to the conference and have begun to introduce the great significance of the conference to the audience.
    People from all walks of life in Beijing are preparing to hold a grand gala with the representatives of the National Conference of Advanced Producers. Several theatrical troupes will perform wonderful programs prepared for the representatives at this meeting.
    Service personnel in some hotels and guest houses preparing to welcome guests have cleaned the rooms thoroughly. A group of childcare workers drawn from some nurseries in the capital have been assembled, and they will diligently take care of the little babies brought by the mothers attending the conference.
  The Ranks of National Advanced Producers Continue to Expand
    According to preliminary statistics from eight provinces and cities, more than 200,000 advanced producers have emerged this year. These eight provinces and cities are Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Xi'an.
    In other provinces and cities across the country, the ranks of advanced producers are also expanding. In Wuhan, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau alone, under its six basic construction units, has seen more than 1,840 advanced producers and 89 advanced collective units emerge in recent months. In Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, according to statistics from 29 enterprises in March, more than 3,700 advanced producers and 291 advanced collective units have emerged.
    Thousands of workers who previously had poor production have reached the level of advanced producers because they actively learned advanced experiences in the large-scale advanced producer movement and received enthusiastic help from advanced producers. In the past, 70% of the workers at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory often failed to meet quotas. After learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and their own factory, more than half of them have now become advanced producers. Ai Zhaochang, a national model worker on highways, has taught his experience to 191 automobile drivers through the form of advanced experience schools from November of last year to the present, and more than 100 of these drivers have now become advanced experience promoters.
    Famous Scientists and Professors Will Attend the Conference
    More than one hundred famous scientists and professors will attend the National Conference of Advanced Producers.
    Paleontologist Yang Zhongjian, mathematician Hua Luogeng, aerodynamicist Qian Xuesen, archaeologist Xia Nai, soil scientist Xiong Yi, and experimental biologist Zhu Xi will all attend the conference.
    Among the advanced producer representatives in universities and colleges are Ma Wenzhao, professor at Beijing Medical College, Zhang Guangdou, professor at Tsinghua University, Lin Qiaozhi and Wu Yingkai, professors at the Chinese Union Medical College, Fu Zhongsun, vice president and professor at Beijing Normal University, Hou Guangjiong, professor at Southwest Agricultural College, Li Guohao, professor at Tongji University, Wang Zisong, associate professor at Peking University, Gu Chaohao, young lecturer at Fudan University, and Su Xing, young lecturer at Renmin University of China.
  Excellent Primary and Secondary School Educators Arrive in Beijing
    One hundred and ten outstanding educators selected from primary and secondary schools and normal schools across the country have arrived in Beijing one after another to attend the National Conference of Advanced Producers. Among them are teachers from primary and secondary schools and normal schools, Young Pioneer instructors, kindergarten teachers, teachers of spare-time schools for workers, and educational administrators.
    Among these outstanding educators are Ren Ruiqing, the 68-year-old principal of Matuan Complete Primary School in Pingdu County, Shandong Province, who has never left his educational work post in 47 years since the age of 20. There is also Cao Hegui, a primary school teacher from a poor peasant family in Xinxian County, Shanxi Province, who comprehensively cares for children and maintains close contact with parents, and Liu Jingkun, a chemistry teacher at Beijing No. 4 Middle School with more than 30 years of rich teaching experience.

    迎接全国先进生产者代表会议
    首都人民迎接先进人物
    在北京车站前广场上，已经竖立起十一公尺高的红色标语塔，上面刻着：“庆祝全国先进生产者代表会议开幕”等斗大的金字。在过去几天里，这个车站的职工已经接待了从全国各地来京的成千名代表；他们还在候车室里为来京代表们准备下了漂亮的休息室。
    同样的，一些高大的标语塔也已经在北京热闹的街头和公共场所竖立起来。许多街头的墙壁和商店的橱窗上，也贴上了庆祝这次会议的宣传画和五颜六色的标语。有些标语写着：“人人争取做先进生产者，向先进生产者学习！”“向把智慧献给祖国的先进生产者致敬！”
    全市大部分工人俱乐部、电影院已经开始放映有关会议的宣传画，并且开始向观众介绍这次会议的重大意义。
    北京市各界人民正在筹备和全国先进生产者代表会议的代表举行一次隆重的联欢晚会。有好几个剧团的戏剧工作者，将在这个会上演出他们为代表们准备下的精采节目。
    准备迎接客人的一些旅馆、招待所的服务人员，已经把房间打扫得干干净净。从首都部分托儿所抽调出来的一批保育人员已经集中起来，她们将尽心地照顾来开会的妈妈们带来的小宝宝。
  全国先进生产者队伍不断扩大

    成千上万的原先生产较差的职工，因为在声势浩大的先进生产者运动中积极学习先进经验，并且得到先进生产者的热心帮助，也都达到了先进生产者的水平。太原矿山机器厂过去有70％的工人经常达不到定额，经过学习苏联和本厂的先进经验后，其中有一半以上的工人目前已经成为先进生产者。全国公路劳动模范艾肇昌，通过先进经验学校的形式，从去年十一月到现在向一百九十一名汽车司机传授了自己的经验，其中也有一百多名司机目前已经成为先进经验推广员。著名科学家和教授将出席会议
