    Northeast People's University Uses Semiconductor Germanium to Make Germanium Power Rectifier
    The germanium power rectifier trial-produced by the Semiconductor Laboratory of the Physics Department of Northeast People's University using semiconductor "germanium" has been successful.
    The germanium power rectifier made by this laboratory is only the size of a cigarette case, has a simple structure, and is very low in cost. However, it outputs a power of 500 watts, and the maximum DC current can reach 15 amperes. Using the same method, rectifiers of similar size but greater power can be manufactured. It is far superior to the complex and expensive DC generators and rectifiers currently used in factories, mines, enterprises, national defense, and scientific research. Therefore, the widespread trial use of germanium rectifiers can save the country a lot of materials and manpower in construction and production.
    In addition, the laboratory has also successfully trial-produced germanium detectors, which are an indispensable part of radar and microwave communication equipment.
    These trial production works were led by Gao Dingsan, a teacher in the Physics Department. Gao Dingsan returned to the motherland in June 1955 after overcoming various obstacles from the United States, and went to the Physics Department of Northeast People's University to engage in teaching and research work. In February of this year, the Physics Department established a Semiconductor Laboratory, which he led in research work. The school sent lecturers and experimenters to assist him in his research and equipped him with assistants. They produced the germanium power rectifier in five weeks. The laboratory is now starting preparations for manufacturing germanium electron tubes.

    东北人民大学用半导体锗制成锗功率整流器
    东北人民大学物理系半导体实验室利用半导体“锗”试制的锗功率整流器已经成功。
    这个实验室制成的锗功率整流器只有烟盒大小，构造简单，成本很低。但它输出的功率有五百瓦，最大直流电流可达十五安培。用同样方法，可以制造体积相仿而功率更大的整流器。它要比目前各工厂矿山企业、国防和科学研究等方面使用的构造复杂而昂贵的直流发电机和整流器优越得多。因此，锗整流器的推广试用，可以使国家在建设、生产上节省大量资材和人力。
    另外，这个实验室还试制成功锗检波器，它是雷达和微波通讯设备上不可缺少的部分。
    这些试制工作都是由物理系教师高鼎三领导进行的。高鼎三在1955年6月排除美国种种阻挠回到祖国后，就到东北人民大学物理学系担任教学、研究工作。今年二月，物理系建立半导体实验室，由他领导研究工作。学校派讲师和实验员协助他进行研究，并且为他配置了助手。他们在五个星期内就制成了锗功率整流器。现在，这个实验室已着手进行制造锗电子管的准备工作。
