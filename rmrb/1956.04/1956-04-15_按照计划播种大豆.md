    In their practical work, some comrades often emphasize one point and overlook another; they grasp one aspect and lose sight of another. The promotion of multiple high-yield crops and the excessive reduction of soybean planting areas in some regions is the result of this kind of one-sided thinking.

    Everyone knows why soybeans should be planted and what role they play in the daily lives of urban and rural people and in the country's export trade. So, why are some people still unwilling to plant soybeans? It is said that this is because the yield per unit area of soybeans is relatively low. True, the average yield of soybeans planted in various parts of China is only about 100 catties per mu, and the unit yield is indeed lower than that of other grain crops; some people who disregard the actual needs of the country and the people and simply pursue grain production figures are only willing to plant other grain crops and are unwilling to plant soybeans. But, the problem lies here. Since the country has to export some soybeans every year to exchange for materials urgently needed for economic construction, how can those areas suitable for soybean growth not plant an appropriate amount of soybeans to meet the needs of the country? Since urban and rural people want to eat vegetable oil, tofu, and bean paste, why don't areas that can grow soybeans plant the minimum amount of soybeans to meet the urgent needs of the people? It is easy to understand that a small number of farmers do not understand this reason and have not planted soybeans according to the national plan. However, rural work cadres at all levels should regard the planting of soybeans as a major issue concerning national construction and the interests of the people, and strictly follow the national plan to ensure the completion of the planting task.

    Ensuring the completion of the planting task does not mean that we can slightly impose coercion on farmers, but rather that we should conduct arduous, meticulous, and in-depth persuasion work on farmers. It is necessary to clearly explain to the cadres and members of agricultural producers' cooperatives: planting soybeans according to the national plan is beneficial to both the country and the farmers; it is glorious to obey the national planting plan, comprehensively complete the planting task, and increase the total output of crops under this premise. If the national planting plan is violated, even if the output of a certain type or several types of crops is very high, it cannot be considered a comprehensive completion of the task. In addition, it is also necessary to help farmers overcome various material and technical difficulties in the process of planting soybeans, and to determine reasonable purchase prices and improve the purchase and supply of materials. Now that the planting season has arrived, all regions must quickly determine the soybean planting area and earnestly prepare for soybean planting. The principle for determining the soybean planting area should be: first ensure the needs of the country, while taking into account the needs and habits of farmers. Therefore, there must be careful calculations and flexible plans. For example, in some areas, soybeans are mainly grown to meet people's need for edible oil. In these areas, when determining the planting area, on the premise of ensuring the needs of the country, appropriately planting some other oil crops with larger yields and higher oil yields, so that the result of production can not only ensure that the country gets the necessary soybeans, but also ensure the supply of edible oil to farmers, which can be supported and welcomed by farmers.

    Adopting various methods to greatly increase the yield of soybeans is also an important task in the future. High-yield records of soybeans exist in various regions. Last year, the Yongli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bin County, Heilongjiang planted 180 mu of soybeans, with an average harvest of 393 catties per mu. Last year, the Nanjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tongling County, Anhui planted 116 mu of soybeans, with an average harvest of 498 catties per mu. These are all large-area high-yield records, and the small-area high-yield records are even higher than these. These examples most eloquently tell people: China's soybean production has great potential for increasing production, and as long as appropriate measures are taken to gradually tap these potentials, the average yield of soybeans can be quickly increased by several to dozens of percentage points within a few years.

    An effective way to quickly increase soybean yield is to earnestly promote advanced experience. This method does not require a lot of investment, but can quickly obtain the benefits of increased production. Experiences such as selecting excellent varieties, planting in a timely manner, and mixing soybean rhizobium with seeds have long been proven to be effective, and can be universally adopted in various places. In addition, there are still some advanced experiences in various regions that are adapted to local conditions, which should be summarized in a timely manner and promoted locally.

    Chinese farmers have long created the experience of intercropping tall-stalk crops such as corn with beans. Using this method can not only increase the total yield per unit area, but also solve the contradiction between high-yield crops and soybeans competing for land to a certain extent. According to some typical surveys, in Liaoning Province, intercropping corn and soybeans generally increases production by 10% to 15% compared to single cropping. In Shandong Province, the average increase in production is 15% to 25% using this method. According to a survey in Xincheng County, Guangxi Province, intercropping corn and soybeans yields 260 catties of corn and 180 catties of soybeans per mu. These facts fully demonstrate that as long as correct methods are adopted, it is entirely possible to both complete the task of producing soybeans and realize the plan to increase the production of other grain crops.

### 按照计划播种大豆

    按照计划播种大豆
    有些同志在做实际工作的时候，常常是强调了这一点，忽略了那一点；抓住了这一面，丢掉了那一面。某些地区提倡多种高产作物而过分地缩小大豆种植面积，就是这种片面的思想方法造成的结果。
    为什么要种植大豆，大豆在城乡人民的日常生活中，在国家的出口贸易中有什么作用，这是尽人皆知的。那末，为什么有些人还不愿意种植大豆呢？据说这是因为大豆的单位面积产量比较低。不错，目前我国各地种的大豆，平均每亩产量不过百斤左右，单位产量确实比较别的粮食作物低一些；某些不顾国家和人民的实际需要、单纯追逐粮食产量数字的人，于是只愿意种植别的粮食作物，而不愿意种植大豆。但是，问题也就出在这个地方。既然国家每年都要出口一些大豆，换取经济建设急需的物资，那些宜于大豆生长的地区，怎么能够不种植适当数量的大豆来满足国家需要呢？既然城乡人民要吃植物油，要吃豆腐，要吃豆酱，能种大豆的地区，为什么不种植最低限度的大豆，以满足人民的迫切需要呢？少数农民一时不明白这个道理，没有按照国家计划种植大豆，这是容易理解的。但是，各级农村工作干部却应该把种植大豆这件事情，看作是一个对待国家建设和人民利益的大问题，严格地按照国家计划，保证完成播种任务。
    保证完成播种任务，绝不意味着可以稍许对农民实行强迫命令，而是说应该对农民进行艰苦、细致、深入的说服工作。一定要对农业生产合作社的干部、社员说清楚：按照国家计划种植大豆，对国家、对农民都有好处；服从国家的种植计划，全面地完成播种任务，并且在这个前提之下提高农作物的总产量，这样才是光荣的。如果违反了国家的种植计划，虽然某一种或某几种农作物的产量很高，也不能算全面地完成了任务。此外，还要帮助农民克服种植大豆过程中物质的、技术的各种困难，并且要确定合理的收购价格，改进收购和物资供应工作。现在已到播种季节，各个地区要赶快确定大豆种植面积，认真做好播种大豆的准备工作。确定大豆种植面积的原则应该是：首先保证国家的需要，同时照顾农民的需要和习惯。因此必须有细致的计算和灵活的计划。例如，有些地区种大豆，主要是为了满足人们对食油的需要，在这些地区，确定播种面积的时候，在保证国家需要的前提下，适当地多种一些别的产量较大、出油率较高的油料作物，使生产的结果既能保证国家得到必要的大豆，又能保证农民的食油供应，这是能得到农民的拥护和欢迎的。
    采用各种办法，把大豆的产量大大提高，这也是今后的一项重要工作。大豆的高额丰产纪录，各个地区都是有的。黑龙江宾县永利农业生产合作社去年种了一百八十亩大豆，平均每亩收获三百九十三斤。安徽铜陵县南江农业生产合作社，去年种的一百十六亩大豆，平均每亩收获四百九十八斤。这些都是大面积的丰产纪录，至于小面积的丰产纪录，还要比它们高的多。这些事例最雄辩地告诉人们：我国大豆生产的增产潜力非常大，只要采取适当的措施，把这些潜力逐步挖掘出来，完全可以在几年以内，把大豆的平均产量，迅速提高百分之几到几十。
    迅速提高大豆产量的有效方法，是认真推广先进经验。这种方法不必增加很多投资，却能够很快地获得增产的效益。像选用优良品种，适时地播种，大豆根瘤菌拌种等等经验，早已证明行之有效，各地可以普遍采用。此外，各个地区都还有一些适应当地情况的先进经验，应该及时加以总结，就地普遍推广。
    我国农民早就创造了用玉米等高秆作物和豆类间作的经验。采用这种方法，不仅可以提高单位面积总产量，而且可以在一定程度上解决高产作物和大豆争地的矛盾。根据一些典型调查，在辽宁省实行玉米和大豆间作，一般比单作增产百分之十到十五。在山东省采用这个方法，平均增产百分之十五到二十五。据广西省忻城县调查，实行玉米和大豆间作，每亩收获玉蜀黍二百六十斤，大豆一百八十斤。这些事实充分说明，只要采用正确的方法，完全可以既完成了生产大豆的任务，又实现了增产别的粮食作物的计划。
