    No Retail Ink Available
    In the past, small shops in many Shanghai alleyways used to sell ink in bulk. Nearby residents could bring an empty bottle and buy as much as they needed, which was very convenient. However, for the past two months or so, these small shops have not been selling ink retail.

    What is the reason for this? It turns out that the ink sold by these small shops was supplied by eighteen private ink factories in Shanghai. After the private ink factories were converted into joint state-private enterprises last December, they merged with larger factories for production, and all ink is now exclusively sold by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Cultural Goods Company. The ink sold by the stores is all supplied by the wholesale store of the Shanghai branch of the Cultural Goods Company. This wholesale store has an old rule: it only sells goods to stores with purchase certificates. These small stores do not have purchase certificates and cannot purchase goods from the wholesale store. Therefore, residents cannot buy bulk retail ink.

    This matter shows that after the economic reorganization of joint state-private enterprises, during the transition of supply and sales relationships, some supply and sales systems that are not suitable for the new situation should be changed in a timely manner. Otherwise, the original supply and sales relationships will be interrupted, and an artificial shortage of goods will be created. (Excerpt from Jiefang Daily)

    没有零卖的墨水
    上海市许多里弄的小商店，过去都经营散装零墨水。附近居民拿个空瓶子去买，要多少有多少，非常方便。但是，近两个多月来，这些小商店却没有零卖的墨水了。
    这是什么原因呢？原来，这些小商店所经营的墨水，都是由上海的十八家私营墨水厂分别供应的。去年十二月私营墨水厂实行公私合营以后，就同大厂合并生产，墨水全部由中国文化用品公司上海采购供应站包销。各商店经销的墨水，统统由文化用品公司上海市公司的批发商店供应。这个批发商店有一个老制度：只向有购货证的商店批货，这些小商店没有购货证，不能向批发商店进货。所以，居民就买不到散装零售墨水。
    这件事情说明，在公私合营企业经济改组以后，在转移供销关系的过程中，应该及时地改变一些不适合新情况的供销制度，否则，原有供销关系就会中断，就会造成人为的商品脱销。（摘自解放日报）
