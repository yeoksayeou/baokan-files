Recently, some staff members of the Second Store of the Changchun City Department Store and some stores of the Linjiang Department Store, as soon as they heard that cheap clothing materials had arrived, bought a batch for themselves first, and quickly notified their relatives and friends to rush to buy them. Some staff members of the Third Store of the Jilin City Department Store selected a batch of clothing materials before they were put on sale; later, they found that the quality of the clothing materials was not good, so they returned them to the store. Some customers were very dissatisfied and thought this was a fraudulent act.

However, some commercial staff members did not accept the customers' criticism, saying: "Why can't we buy them?" Of course, commercial staff members can buy cheaper goods, but they should be the same as ordinary customers. Before the goods are officially released for sale, they cannot be pre-selected; goods that have already been purchased cannot be returned to the store. It is not right for a staff member to regard his job as a stepping stone to taking advantage.

    不该捷足先得
    最近，长春市百货公司第二商店和临江百货公司的商店的一些工作人员，一听到廉价的衣料来了，自己便先购买一批，并且连忙通知自己的亲戚朋友来抢先购买。吉林市百货公司第三商店的一些工作人员在衣料未出售以前，先选购了一批；后来发现衣料质量不好，又退给商店。有些顾客非常不满，认为这是一种舞弊行为。
    但是有些商业工作人员不接受顾客的批评，说：“我们为什么不能购买？”当然，商业工作人员可以购买价钱便宜的商品，但是，应该跟一般顾客一样。在商品正式发售以前，不能预先选购；已经购买了的商品也不能退给商店。一个工作人员把工作岗位看成是占便宜的跳板是不应该的。
