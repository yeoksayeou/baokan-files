Medical colleges across the country will add traditional Chinese medicine courses starting with students enrolling in the fall of this year. The Ministry of Health is revising the teaching plans and syllabuses of various majors in medical colleges based on the requirements for adding traditional Chinese medicine courses.

Local health departments are responsible for resolving the need for teachers to add traditional Chinese medicine courses.

Secondary-level health schools and nursing schools will also add traditional Chinese medicine courses at the same time, as well as add courses in Qigong, Tuina, acupuncture, and traditional Chinese medicine nursing.
