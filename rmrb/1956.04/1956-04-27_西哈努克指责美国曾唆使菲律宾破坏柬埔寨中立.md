Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 26th: Phnom Penh Dispatch: Former Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sihanouk revealed on April 25th a fact about being brutally forced to abandon Cambodia's neutral policy. He said that during his visit to the Philippines in February of this year, the Philippine government tried to persuade him to issue a statement declaring Cambodia's support for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and its willingness to abandon neutrality.

Sihanouk said that when he was in Manila, a man named Francois Baruch, in the name of the Philippine government, wanted him to issue a statement to dilute his speech defending Cambodia's neutral policy in the Philippine Congress. He said, "Baruch gave me a draft he had written in English. I later learned that this draft was dictated to Baruch by a stranger, who was not Filipino." At this time, Sihanouk produced a photocopy of the draft statement he was asked to issue. He said that because he refused to issue this statement, Philippine officials made him a target of attack.

Sihanouk said, "I don't want to mention many other important events that happened during my visit to the Philippines. I also want to say that other countries closely related to the United States are threatening Cambodia because of its neutrality."

Sihanouk revealed the above facts when commenting on a letter that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles wrote to Cambodian Foreign Minister Long Kim Ngan on April 19th. In that letter, Dulles flatly denied that the United States had used pressure to force Cambodia to abandon its neutrality and join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    西哈努克指责美国曾唆使菲律宾破坏柬埔寨中立
    新华社河内26日电  金边消息：柬埔寨王国前首相西哈努克亲王在4月25日揭露了一件粗暴地迫使柬埔寨放弃中立政策的事实。他说：在他今年2月间访问菲律宾的期间，菲律宾政府曾经想说服他发表一篇声明，宣布柬埔寨赞成东南亚条约组织，并且愿意放弃中立。
    西哈努克说，当他在马尼拉的时候，有一个名叫佛朗科斯·巴鲁克的人以菲律宾政府的名义要他发表一篇声明，以冲淡他在菲律宾国会发表的为柬埔寨的中立政策辩护的演说。他说：“巴鲁克给了我一篇他用英文写的稿子。我后来了解到，这篇稿子是一个陌生人口授给巴鲁克的，这个陌生人不是菲律宾人。”西哈努克在这个时候拿出了这篇要他发表的声明稿子的影印本。他说：由于他拒绝发表这篇声明，菲律宾官员们就把他当作攻击对象。
    西哈努克说：“我不想提到在我访问菲律宾期间发生的许多其它重要事件了。我还要说，其它同美国有密切关系的国家正由于柬埔寨的中立而威胁它。”
    西哈努克是在评论美国国务卿杜勒斯四月十九日写给柬埔寨外交大臣龙金尼的信件的时候把上述事实揭露出来的。杜勒斯在那封信中曾经矢口否认美国曾经使用压力强迫柬埔寨放弃中立和参加东南亚条约组织。
