South China Institute of Technology and Other Universities
A Batch of Teaching Assistants Promoted to Lecturers
A total of 131 teaching assistants and others from three universities, including South China Institute of Technology, South China Medical College, and South China Normal College, have been promoted to lecturers this year. Most of them graduated from universities after liberation, and many have independently taught courses for two or three years. Among the fifty-three new lecturers at South China Normal College, some have also made some achievements in scientific research. For example, Wu Xunxia from the Department of History, Liang Qianhua from the Department of Biology, and Feng Hanjun from the Department of Russian Language have all written scientific papers and participated in the recent scientific symposium held by the college.

    华南工学院等高等学校
    一批助教被提升为讲师
    华南工学院、华南医学院、华南师范学院等三所高等学校有131位助教等，在今年先后被提升为讲师。他们大多是解放以后才在高等学校毕业的，有不少人已经独立开课两三年。华南师范学院的五十三名新讲师中，有些在科学研究工作上还做出了一些成绩，例如历史系的吴勋夏、生物系的梁倩华、俄语系的冯汉军等都写了科学论文，参加了该院最近举行的科学讨论会。　（南方日报编辑部）
