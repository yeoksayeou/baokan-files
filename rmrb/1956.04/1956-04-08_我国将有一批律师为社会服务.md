A batch of lawyers will be added throughout the country in 1956 to provide legal services to the people, government organs, enterprises, and organizations. This was stated by the person in charge of the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China at the National Lawyers Work Symposium that closed on the 3rd.

The person in the charge of the Ministry of Justice said that since the promulgation of the Constitution of the People' Republic of China, the Ministry of Justice has gradually established lawyer work in various provinces and cities to implement Article 76 of the Constitution regarding the defendant's right to obtain a defense. The purpose of this symposium is to exchange the experiences already gained in the lawyer work in various regions and discuss the drafts of the Lawyers' Charter and the Interim Measures for Lawyers' Fees. After the two drafts are revised, they will be submitted by the Ministry of Justice to the State Council for approval and promulgation.

The symposium believes that the task of lawyers is to provide legal assistance to citizens, government organs, enterprises, and organizations, to reduce disputes and prevent crime from a proactive perspective, and to safeguard the revolutionary legal system. Its activities include: answering public inquiries and providing legal opinions; drafting appeals, lawsuits, and other documents related to legal acts; participating in litigation as defense counsel for criminal defendants and as agents for civil plaintiffs, defendants, and other interested parties. Lawyers associations are established in each province, autonomous region, and city to lead the lawyer work in their respective regions. They are social organizations voluntarily formed by lawyers; legal advisory offices are the working bodies of lawyers. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    我国将有一批律师为社会服务
    在一九五六年内，全国各地将增加一批律师为人民群众和机关、企业、团体进行法律方面的服务。这是中华人民共和国司法部的负责人在三日闭幕的全国律师工作座谈会上说的。
    司法部的负责人说，自中华人民共和国的宪法公布以后，司法部就逐步在各省、市建立律师工作，以执行宪法第七十六条关于被告人有权获得辩护的规定。这一次座谈会就是要交流各地律师工作中已经取得的经验，讨论律师章程的草稿和律师收费暂行办法的草稿，这两个草稿经修改后将由司法部提交国务院批准公布。
    座谈会认为律师的任务是给公民、机关、企业、团体以法律上的帮助，从积极方面减少纠纷和预防犯罪，以维护革命法制。它的活动方法是：解答群众询问并提供法律上的意见；代写申诉书、诉状和其他有关法律行为的文件；参加诉讼，作为刑事被告的辩护人和民事原告、被告及其他利害关系人的代理人。在各省、自治区、市设立律师协会，领导所在地区的律师工作，它是律师自愿组成的社会团体；法律顾问处是律师的办事机构。　（据新华社）
