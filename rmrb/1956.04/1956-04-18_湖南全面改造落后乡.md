Hunan Province has fully launched its work to transform backward villages. In the 145 villages where transformation work has been completed, many new atmospheres have emerged. Louxia Township in Leiyang County originally did not have a single agricultural cooperative. The Chinese Communist Party branch in this township had ten members, two of whom were class enemies who had infiltrated the Party. In reality, all the work in the township was manipulated by the counter-revolutionary element Deng Chengming. After the Leiyang County Party Committee dispatched a work team to carry out arduous transformation work in this township, thirty-nine activists have now been cultivated. Two class enemies who had infiltrated the Party have been expelled, and six new Party members have been admitted, establishing a new branch. Under the exposure and struggle of the masses, the government has already arrested the counter-revolutionary element Deng Chengming. 85% of the peasant households in the township have joined five agricultural production cooperatives and are now actively engaged in spring plowing.

    湖南全面改造落后乡
    湖南省改造落后乡工作已经全面展开。在完成改造工作的145个乡中，出现了许多新的气象。耒阳县楼下乡原来没有一个农业合作社，这个乡的中共支部有十名党员，其中有两人是混进党内的阶级异己分子，全乡一切工作，实际上都受反革命分子邓承铭的操纵。经过中共耒阳县委派遣工作组在这个乡进行艰苦的改造工作之后，现在已经培养了三十九名积极分子。开除了两名混进党内的阶级异己分子，新吸收六名党员，成立新的支部。在群众揭发和斗争下，政府已经逮捕了反革命分子邓承铭。全乡农民有85％的农户加入五个农业生产合作社，现正积极投入春耕生产。
