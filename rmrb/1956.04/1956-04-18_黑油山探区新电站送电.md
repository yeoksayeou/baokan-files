    New Power Station in Heiyoushan Exploration Area Sends Power
    A power station built by the Xinjiang Petroleum Company in the Heiyoushan exploration area began supplying electricity on April 8th. This power station supplies electricity for the exploration wells near Heiyoushan this year, as well as for lighting and power for mechanical repairs in the exploration area.
    Before the power station went into operation, the workers drilling for oil used crude oil seeping from Heiyoushan for lighting. Working under these lamps, their faces would turn black in less than an hour. Now the workers use electric lights for illumination at night. After the power station supplies electricity, a small mechanical repair shop will also be put into production. (Reported by Xinhua News Agency)

    黑油山探区新电站送电
    新疆石油公司在黑油山探区修建的一座发电站，在四月八日开始送电。这个发电站供应今年黑油山附近的探井和探区的照明以及机械修理的动力用电。
    在电站没有投入生产以前，钻探油田的职工是用黑油山冒出来的黑原油照明，职工们在这种灯下工作，不到一个钟头脸就变成黑的。现在职工晚间都用电灯来照明了。发电站送电以后，一座小型机械修理厂也将投入生产。（据新华社讯）
