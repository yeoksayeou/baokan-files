Yunnan Baiyao's Secret Formula is Made Public

The secret formula of Yunnan Baiyao, famous at home and abroad, has been made public.

Baiyao, also known as Bai Mu Dan, can stop bleeding, relieve pain, and treat trauma. It was researched and developed by Qu Huanzhang, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor in Kunming. He had been running this Baiyao for more than 60 years and never passed it on to outsiders. In order to obtain the Baiyao prescription, the Kuomintang government arrested Qu Huanzhang in Chongqing in 1938 and subjected him to torture, eventually killing him. After Qu Huanzhang's death, his wife, Miao Lanying, continued the research and production of Baiyao. After liberation, Baiyao production was protected by the People's Government. At the beginning of this year, the owner of Qu Huanzhang Baiyao voluntarily applied to become a local state-owned enterprise. Miao Lanying served as a Baiyao technician, and her daughter also participated in the pharmaceutical work. The People's Government also gave her a monthly subsidy in consideration of Miao Lanying's age. This concern from the government deeply moved her, so she made the Baiyao secret formula passed down by Qu Huanzhang public to the people.

    云南白药的秘方公开了
    闻名国内外的云南白药秘方公开了。
    白药又名百墓丹，能够止血、止痛、医治创伤，是昆明中医师曲焕章研究出来的。他经营这种白药有六十多年的历史，一直不向外传。国民党政府为了获得白药的处方，曾在1938年把曲焕章抓到重庆，施用酷刑，最后把曲焕章害死。曲焕章死后，他的夫人缪兰英继续进行白药的研究和生产工作。解放后，白药生产受到人民政府的保护。今年年初，曲焕章白药房的主人自愿申请转为地方国营后，缪兰英担任了制白药的技师，她的女儿也参加了制药工作。人民政府为了照顾缪兰英年岁大，每月还发给她补助金。政府对她这种关怀，使她深受感动，她便把曲焕章传授下来的白药秘方向人民公开出来。
