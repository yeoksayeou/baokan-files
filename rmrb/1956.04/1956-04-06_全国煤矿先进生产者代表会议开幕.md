Xinhua News Agency, April 5th. The National Coal Mine Advanced Producers Representative Conference opened in Beijing today.

Attending the conference were more than 2,300 representatives from geological, design, mine construction, and production departments of the national coal mine system, including 1,253 representatives of advanced producers. They will extensively exchange advanced experiences in various aspects at this conference.

Minister of Coal Industry Chen Yu delivered a report at today's meeting. He said that since the national coal mine workers widely launched the socialist emulation campaign last winter, their production enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high. In the Fushun Coal Mine alone, more than 15,000 workers have put forward more than 17,000 rationalization proposals, of which more than 7,000 have been implemented. The advanced experience of the Soviet "one-team coal mining system" has also been rapidly promoted in more than 220 coal mining faces in the national coal mines. In this competition, many previously backward units and individuals have been deeply educated and have followed the example of advanced producers, and some have become advanced units and advanced producers.

Chen Yu said that due to the in-depth development of the socialist emulation campaign, the potential in production and construction in the coal mine system has been further explored. According to the preliminary plans recently formulated by various enterprises, the output of raw coal this year can exceed the national plan by 6.6%, the design tasks of the mines can be completed ahead of schedule, the construction of eleven new pairs of mines will start ahead of the original plan, and the construction of another twenty-eight pairs of mines will be handed over to production ahead of schedule this year.

Then, Shen Zhixian, on behalf of the National Committee of the Coal Mine Workers' Union of China, gave a report to the conference on further developing the socialist emulation campaign.

Also speaking at the meeting today were Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, representatives of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and representatives of farmers from the suburbs of Beijing.

    据新华社5日讯　全国煤矿先进生产者代表会议今天在北京开幕。
    出席会议的有全国煤矿系统的地质、设计、矿井建设和生产等部门的代表二千三百多人，其中有1，253人是先进生产者的代表。他们将在这次会议上广泛地交流各方面的先进经验。
    煤炭工业部部长陈郁在今天的会上作了报告。他说，全国煤矿职工从去年冬季广泛开展社会主义竞赛以来，生产积极性空前高涨。仅抚顺煤矿就有一万五千多名职工提出了一万七千多条合理化建议，已经实现的有七千多条。苏联“一班采煤制”的先进经验，也已经在全国煤矿中的二百二十多个采煤工作面上迅速推广。在这个竞赛中，许多过去落后的单位和个人，都受到了深刻教育，纷纷向先进生产者看齐，有的已经成为先进单位和先进生产者。
    陈郁说，由于社会主义竞赛的深入开展，煤矿系统中生产和建设方面的潜力已经进一步发掘出来。根据各个企业最近制定的初步规划，今年原煤产量可以超过国家计划6.6％，矿井的设计任务可以提前完成，有十一对新建矿井将比原定计划提前施工，另外有二十八对矿井的建设工程将在今年提前移交生产。
    接着，申志贤代表中国煤矿工会全国委员会向大会作了关于进一步开展社会主义竞赛的报告。
