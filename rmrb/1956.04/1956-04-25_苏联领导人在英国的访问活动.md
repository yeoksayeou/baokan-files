Xinhua News Agency, London, April 24th (TASS dispatch): On the evening of April 22nd, Bulganin and Khrushchev attended a reception held by the London County Council. More than 300 people attended the reception, including all members of the London County Council, mayors of various cities comprising London County, Minister of Housing and Local Government Sandys, Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Reading, Labour Party leader Gaitskell, and others.

    Mrs. Helen Bentwich, Chairman of the London County Council, read out the London County Council's welcome address to the Soviet leaders and presented the full text of the welcome address, written on a parchment scroll, to the Soviet leaders.

    The welcome address stated that the representatives of the people of London County, on their behalf, extend a welcome to you. We would like to ask you to convey to the people of your country our respects and our hope for a better understanding between us in the near future.

    The welcome address stated that the people of London will follow this visit with great interest and pray that the talks will bring the two countries closer to mutual understanding. We, together with our people, hope that an atmosphere will soon emerge among all nations that will bring about a lasting peaceful world.

    Bulganin delivered a reply, which was met with warm applause.

    Bulganin said that we hope that more and more Londoners will visit Moscow and that more and more Muscovites will visit London. We will always be happy to welcome any representatives of Britain, London, and London County in Moscow and other parts of our country.

    Not everything is smooth between the Soviet and British people yet, and not everything is clear. We still have many issues for which we have not achieved due mutual understanding. We should expand our relations in all aspects between our two countries. The broader these connections, the deeper our mutual understanding will be.

    After the ceremony, Bulganin, Khrushchev, and others, accompanied by Mrs. Bentwich and other County Council leaders, visited an exhibition showcasing the work and achievements of the County Council. The mayors of various London cities were introduced to meet them. Bulganin and Khrushchev spoke with the leaders of the City of London in the large reception hall.
  
    Visiting Birmingham, a Major Industrial Center

    Xinhua News Agency, London, April 24th (TASS dispatch): On the morning of the 23rd, Bulganin and Khrushchev traveled by plane from London to Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city and a major industrial center, for a visit.

    After the Soviet guests arrived at Birmingham Airport, they drove to Birmingham City Council. Along the streets leading to the City Council building, there were crowds of citizens welcoming them, warmly cheering for the Soviet leaders. The crowd gathered in the square in front of the City Council numbered about five thousand people.

    Representatives from all walks of life held a reception in the hall of the City Council. Mayor Gibson of Birmingham, on behalf of the city's residents, expressed his respect to the Soviet guests, saying that the residents of Birmingham hope that mutual understanding between the Soviet and British countries can be transformed into lasting friendship.

    Subsequently, Bulganin delivered a reply. He expressed his gratitude for the warm and friendly reception. He said that the friendship between the Soviet and British people was strengthened during the past war against fascist aggression. However, some misunderstandings have arisen since the war. There has been some coldness in the relations between the two countries. He said that now is not the time to investigate why this situation occurred and what the reasons are. Perhaps, both sides have made some mistakes. We have come to Britain to eliminate this coldness and to establish friendly relations between the two countries.

    Bulganin expressed his belief that the Soviet and British countries will once again be friendly with each other like good friends and cooperate in political, economic, cultural, and other fields.

    After the reception, Bulganin and Khrushchev, accompanied by the Mayor, attended the opening ceremony of the annual British Industries Fair. On the way through the city area, which still retains the scars of war, the Soviet leaders were welcomed by tens of thousands of Birmingham citizens.

    Mayor Gibson of Birmingham, in his speech at the banquet celebrating the opening of the exhibition, said that Britain needs to export goods to live, and it should take every opportunity to show its goods to anyone in the world who might buy them. He said that many countries have recovered from the destruction of war, and countries that have been lagging behind are now becoming industrialized. At this moment, the increasing competition in the world market once again threatens Britain. Therefore, the necessity of exporting and accepting export orders has never been such a patriotic duty for Britain as it is now.

    Khrushchev delivered a speech at the banquet, discussing the issue of trade relations between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries. His speech aroused great interest among those present and was repeatedly interrupted by applause.

    British Trade Minister Thorneycroft then made a brief speech.

    After the visit, Bulganin and Khrushchev left the industrial exhibition and flew to the Royal Air Force Bomber Command base at RAF Marham in Norfolk for a visit.

    British pilots demonstrated their excellent flying skills for the Soviet leaders.

    Before leaving the base, Bulganin and Khrushchev invited Secretary of State for Air Birch and senior officers of the British Air Force to the Soviet Union to participate in the Air Force Day to be held soon in Tushino, near Moscow.

    Bulganin, Khrushchev, and their entourage then returned to London. In the evening, they attended a banquet held for them by the Executive Committee of the British Labour Party in the House of Commons.

    苏联领导人在英国的访问活动
    出席伦敦郡议会招待会
    新华社24日讯  据塔斯社伦敦讯：四月二十二日晚间，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫出席了伦敦郡议会的招待会。参加这次招待会的有三百多人，其中有伦敦郡议会的全体议员，组成伦敦郡的各市的市长、房屋与地方政府部大臣桑迪斯、外交副大臣里丁、工党领袖盖次克尔和其他一些人。
    伦敦郡议会议长海伦·本特韦奇夫人宣读了伦敦郡议会致苏联领袖的欢迎词，并且把写在羊皮卷轴上的欢迎词全文赠给苏联领袖。
    欢迎词说，伦敦郡人民的代表以他们的名义向你们表示欢迎，我们要请你们向你们国家的人民转达我们的敬意以及我们对于我们彼此不久会有更好的了解的希望。
    欢迎词说，伦敦人民将以浓厚的兴趣注视这次访问并且祈祷双方会谈会使两国更加接近于互相谅解。我们同我们的人民一道，希望各国之间不久将产生一种会带来一个持久和平的世界的精神。
    布尔加宁致答词，人们对他的答词报以热烈的鼓掌。
    布尔加宁说，我们希望越来越多的伦敦人访问莫斯科，希望越来越多的莫斯科人访问伦敦。我们将永远高兴地在莫斯科和我们国家的其他部分欢迎英国、伦敦和伦敦郡的任何代表。
    现在苏联和英国人之间还不是一切平顺，还不是一切都已经明朗。我们现在还有许多问题没有得到应有的相互谅解。我们应该扩大我们两国在各方面的联系，这些联系越广泛，我们的相互了解会越深。
    仪式结束后，布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫等人由本特韦奇夫人和其他郡议会领袖们作陪，参观了介绍郡议会的工作和成就的展览会。伦敦各市的市长被介绍和他们见面。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在巨大的会客厅里同伦敦市的领袖们谈话。
  参观大工业中心的伯明翰
    新华社据塔斯社伦敦24日讯  布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫二十三日早晨由伦敦乘飞机前往英国第二大城和大工业中心伯明翰参观。
    苏联客人到达伯明翰机场后就乘汽车前往伯明翰市议会。在通向市议会大厦的街道上，沿途都有市民群众欢迎的行列，向苏联领导人热烈欢呼。聚集在市议会前面的广场上的人群约有五千人。
    各界代表在市议会的大厅里举行了招待会，伯明翰市长吉布逊代表全市居民向苏联客人表示敬意，他说，伯明翰的居民都希望苏英两国间的相互了解能变成持久的友谊。
    接着，布尔加宁致答词。他对热烈友好的接待表示感谢。他说，苏英两国人民的友谊在过去的反法西斯侵略的战争时期曾经加强了。但是在战后发生了一些误解。在两国的关系上有些冷淡。他说，现在不应该去追究为什么会发生这种情况和原因是什么。也许，双方都有些过错。我们来到英国是为了消除这种冷淡，为了建立两国间的友好关系。
    布尔加宁表示相信：苏英两国将重新像好朋友一样友好相处，在政治、经济、文化和其他方面进行合作。
    招待会结束以后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在市长的陪同下，出席了每年一度的英国工业展览会的开幕式。在经过仍然残留着战争创伤的市区的途中，苏联领导人受到了几万伯明翰市民的欢迎。
    伯明翰市长吉布逊在庆祝展览会开幕的宴会上致词说，英国需要输出商品来生活，它应当利用任何一个机会把自己商品拿给全世界可能买我们东西的人看。他说，许多国家已经摆脱了战争破坏，迄今一直落后的国家也正在变为工业国，在这个时刻，世界市场上日益加剧的竞争再次威胁着英国，因此，出口和接受出口定货的必要性从来没有像现在这样成了英国的一种爱国职责。
    赫鲁晓夫在宴会上发表了一篇演说，谈论苏联和资本主义国家的贸易关系问题。他的演说引起了到会者的巨大兴趣，并且多次为掌声所打断。
    英国贸易大臣桑尼克罗夫特接着作了简短的讲话。
    参观结束后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫离开工业展览会，乘飞机飞往诺福克郡的达马哈姆皇家重轰炸机空军基地参观。
    英国的飞行员为苏联领导人表演了他们优异的飞行技术。
    在离开基地之前，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫邀请空军大臣伯奇和英国空军部队高级军官前往苏联参加即将在莫斯科近郊土希诺举行的空军节。
    布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和随行人员然后返回伦敦。晚间，他们出席了英国工党执行委员会在下院为他们举行的宴会。
