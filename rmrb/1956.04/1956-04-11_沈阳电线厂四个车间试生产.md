Four Workshops of Shenyang Wire Factory Start Trial Production

After more than two years of construction and renovation, the Shenyang Wire Factory had completed 93.9% of its total construction investment by the end of the first quarter of this year. Four workshops, including cable and rubber wire workshops, have already started trial production, and the largest rolling workshop in the factory has also started load testing.

Soon, this modern factory will start producing various specifications of wires and cables needed for the sky, seabed, industrial and mining enterprises, cities and rural areas, as well as lacquer wires for airplanes, automobiles, and tractors, and yarn-covered wires and enameled wires for transformers and radios. Among the factory's products are power cables as thick as rice bowls and bare wires thinner than hair strands.

    沈阳电线厂四个车间试生产
    沈阳电线厂经过两年多的施工改建，到今年第一季度末，已经完成建厂投资总额的93.9％。电缆、橡皮线等四个车间已经开始试生产，全厂规模最大的压延车间也开始了负荷试车。
    不久，这座现代化工厂就要开始生产天空、海底、工矿、城市和农村需要的各种规格的电线和电缆，以及飞机、汽车、拖拉机用的腊克线，变压器、收音机用的沙包线和漆包线。这座工厂的产品中，有饭碗口粗的电力电缆，有比头发丝还细的裸线。
