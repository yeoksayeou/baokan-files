Abandoning Darkness for Light
Chen Guang

Zhang Yi, the "Shanghai District Special Commissioner" dispatched by the Kuomintang secret service "Central Committee Second Group" of Chiang Kai-shek to sneak back into the mainland, surrendered himself to the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau on February 16th.

He gave the public security personnel a detailed account of his criminal activities.

Just a few days before this year's Spring Festival, the news that the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee was providing various conveniences for compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao to return home for the Spring Festival spread in Hong Kong. Many people were busy packing their bags, and Zhang Yi also took a "Hong Kong and Macao Resident Spring Festival Return Home Permit" and mingled with the residents returning to the mainland from Hong Kong.

On February 9th, Zhang Yi boarded a train from Guangzhou to Shanghai.

In the carriage, Zhang Yi saw that the passengers were all talking happily and enthusiastically, and no one paid any attention to him. He recalled the kind of fear he had shown in Hong Kong and Macao, which was extremely ridiculous, and regretted not bringing the radio transmitter with him. On the train, he began to look for targets. When he discovered that two soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were discussing their lives in the army, he approached them, attempting to obtain some military intelligence. He had just gotten a little closer when one of the soldiers looked at him attentively and said to the other soldier, "Let's not talk about these things." Zhang Yi did not abandon his attempt to gather intelligence because of this. He continued to look for another target. A young worker, not yet twenty years old, was talking with two companions about his upcoming move from Shanghai to the Northeast. Zhang Yi pretended to be "familiar" with them, squeezed into the conversation circle, and directly asked the young worker:

"Are you going to the Northeast?"

"Yes."

"What kind of work do you do?"

He received no answer.

"Why are you going to the Northeast?"

The young worker coldly said, "Why? For work!" He said nothing else.

After these two attempts, Zhang Yi began to feel nervous again. He felt that it was too dangerous to operate among such people. He found an inconspicuous corner to curl up in and plan his next steps.

On New Year's Eve, the train arrived in Hangzhou. Zhang Yi hurriedly got off the train and ran to Shi Wenxia's house at No. 4 Fengshanren Lane.

Shi Wenxia was a very good friend of Zhang Yi's in the past; her husband, Shi Tongsheng, was also a friend of Zhang Yi's, who used to work in the Kuomintang army and is now in Taiwan. Zhang Yi wanted to use his old relationship with Shi Wenxia and Shi's many weaknesses to have her protect him so that he could carry out his activities.

However, things are not always so smooth. The person at home was Shi Wenxia's younger sister, Shi Jingxia. This younger sister frowned when she saw him and asked:

"Where did you come from?"

Shi Jingxia's suspicious eyes and tense expression showed that she did not welcome this uninvited guest of unknown origin. Zhang Yi had to stammer:

"Sister, I came from Hong Kong to see you."

"We are living well, there is nothing to see."

"This, I know. But, sister! Look at me wearing this Hong Kong 'Tang suit', it's too cold and very unusual, very uncomfortable. Can you accompany me to buy a set of cotton clothes?"

However, this "sister" looked out of the door and replied, "Buying clothes requires cloth coupons! Our cloth coupons are only enough for our own use."

Thus, Zhang Yi had no choice but to change the subject and inquire about Shi Wenxia's situation. Shi Jingxia's series of impatient answers made it impossible for Zhang Yi to ask further.

At this time, Shi Wenxia's daughter, Shi Tihua, happened to be writing a letter at the table. Zhang Yi noticed that there was an envelope with "Jiaxing City Second Hospital" written in the lower corner. Judging from the handwriting, this was likely a letter from Shi Wenxia. To confirm this, Zhang Yi said to Shi Jingxia, "Sister! Let me see the letter from Wenxia!"

"You don't need to see the letter from Wenxia."

No matter how cold Shi Jingxia's attitude was, this sentence proved Shi Wenxia's whereabouts to him. But the weather was so cold, without cotton clothes, without a place to live, what to do? At this time, he suddenly thought of Shi Wenxia's younger brother, Shi Diqin, who had worked in the Kuomintang army before liberation. Finding him might provide some solutions. Zhang Yi approached Shi Tihua, who was wearing a red scarf, and said, "Accompany me to your uncle's house, okay?"

Shi Tihua also said coldly, "I don't want to!"

Zhang Yi turned his hand and took out a Parker pen from his pocket, placed it in front of her and said, "Tihua! I didn't bring any gifts from Hong Kong. Let me give you this Parker pen!"

The girl said, "I have one myself!"

He quickly said, "Then let's exchange them for use as a souvenir!" Tihua didn't want to exchange. He then picked up a box of biscuits and said to Tihua, "Biscuits! I'll leave them for you to eat!" The little girl didn't even look at them and replied, "I don't want to eat them."

Zhang Yi ran into this series of snubs, and his face turned red with embarrassment. Just as he was feeling very awkward, Shi Jingxia came over and said to him, "If you really care about Tihua, please take a look at the February 1st Zhejiang Daily. Premier Zhou's report said that people in Taiwan who are willing to return to the mainland can return. Those who have committed crimes in the past can be treated leniently and can also be given work. If you know Tihua's father's address in Taiwan, tell us, so we can write a letter to call him back. The Communist Party says what it does."

Shi Jingxia's words were like nails hammered into the heart of this old secret agent. Zhang Yi panicked and could only stammer, "Tihua's father is in Taiwan, I am in Hong Kong, I don't know much about his situation. In my opinion, it's better not to write this kind of letter... Um! It's getting late, I'm leaving!"

Zhang Yi walked out of Shi's house in a panic. The streets were lit with lanterns, and everyone was celebrating New Year's Eve. He wore a thin lined jacket and walked through the night market in the sub-zero cold, hugging his neck, with the last bit of hope, he took a car to Jiaxing.

When Zhang Yi ran into Jiaxing Second Hospital, Shi Wenxia was on duty. She was very surprised by Zhang Yi's sudden arrival and said to him without waiting for Zhang Yi to say much, "You'd better talk to our organization!" With that, she ran to report to the person in charge of the hospital.

Shi Wenxia's action was the heaviest blow to Zhang Yi. All the plans he had made in Taiwan completely failed here. He had to anxiously consider his fate. But unexpectedly, the president of the hospital came to him personally, kindly treated him to a meal, and even let him stay. This made Zhang Yi even more frightened.

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, Zhang Yi felt that Shi Wenxia's attitude towards him was more gentle than when they first met yesterday. She bought him cotton clothes, took him out for a walk, and introduced him to the various new things in the high tide of socialist transformation. During the conversation, Shi Wenxia asked him about the fact that he had worked in a Kuomintang agency in Shanghai during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He was silent for a while, felt that he really could not hide it, and stammered, saying that he had "worked in the 'Central Statistics Bureau'. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he had been doing business and struggling for life until now. He had already confessed to joining the 'Central Statistics Bureau' to the Shanghai Military Control Commission at the time of liberation." Shi Wenxia immediately warned him, "Don't you think about who you served in the past, who you worked for, and now, six or seven years after liberation, you are still saying such things!"

In the evening, Shi Wenxia took Zhang Yi to see the movie "Heaven and Earth Net." When a "red scarf" appeared on the screen, Zhang Yi thought of Shi Tihua and his current situation. Suddenly, the "No. 7" special agent in the movie was arrested, and his heart couldn't help but "thump" and he took a deep breath nervously.

After watching this movie, Zhang Yi's mood was very chaotic and nervous. He thought that he could not lie low no matter what. If he was not arrested today, he would be arrested tomorrow. He couldn't run away, he couldn't hide. He wanted to learn from the "traffic" in the movie and surrender himself to the public security organs.

He walked into the house, looking at Shi Wenxia with unease. Shi Wenxia said to him very seriously, "To be frank, I don't trust you."

"Then what should I do?"

Shi Wenxia said firmly, "The government will trust you, and then I will trust you."

This made him dare not say anything else.

On February 14th, Shi Wenxia returned to Hangzhou to see her daughter. Zhang Yi had no place to settle down in Jiaxing, so he had to go to Hangzhou with Shi Wenxia.

That night, Shi Wenxia took the February 1st "Zhejiang Daily" to Zhang Yi, and read Premier Zhou Enlai's "Political Report" to him in detail, especially the section on the policies towards the military and political personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan, repeatedly reading it several times. Shi Wenxia also told him: "Zhang Yi! Since liberation, my daughter and I have lived a stable and happy life. You have seen this with your own eyes. But what about you and your wife and children? For several years, you have been running around outside, worrying and fearing, what kind of life have you been living? You have experienced it yourself. Is this how a person's life ends? Who are you relying on in the end? If you have not sincerely come to rely on the motherland this time, think about it, who will trust you?"

At that time, Zhang Yi simply didn't know how to answer Shi Wenxia. But one thing he was very clear about was that everything Shi Wenxia said was correct. He had reached a serious turning point in deciding his fate: Should he rely on the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, or should he rely on the motherland and the people? Now he had to make a choice. So, he said to Shi Wenxia, "I understand everything you said, don't worry. We can be of the same mind."

Zhang Yi did not sleep all night. He recalled his sinful life for more than a decade, recalled the situation of these days since he sneaked back to the mainland, recalled the fate of the "No. 7" secret agent in the movie "Heaven and Earth Net," and recalled Shi Wenxia's conversation with him and the "Political Report" she read to him. He repeatedly recited in his heart the sentences in the "Political Report" that had the greatest relationship with him: "...All those who are willing to take the road of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, no matter who they are, no matter how big their past crimes have been, the Chinese people will treat them leniently and not hold them accountable for the past..."

The next day, Shi Wenxia and her daughter took Zhang Yi to visit West Lake. They visited Zhongshan Park, which had been completely renovated after liberation, and went to admire the magnificent temple of the national hero Yue Fei, which had been renovated. Then they followed Su Causeway to West Mountain Park, which was a new park built after liberation. There were many people visiting that day, all of whom were so happy and lively. All this made Zhang Yi feel infinite emotion. All the way, he was silent. As soon as he entered the door, he said to Shi Wenxia, "Time can't be delayed any longer, I want to find a place to surrender!"

At the Chengzhan Police Station of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, Zhang Yi reported to the director that he was a secret agent sent by the Chiang Kai-shek secret service "Central Committee Second Group," and handed over evidence of his crimes, and confessed his counter-revolutionary history. It turned out that Zhang Yi had joined Chiang Kai-shek's Central Statistics Bureau secret service organization in 1937, had received secret service training in the "Qingpu Training Class," and had later carried out many anti-communist and anti-people secret service criminal activities in the Shanghai area. He fled to Taiwan at the time of liberation, and joined the American secret service agency "Western Enterprise Company" and received training. In 1950, he had sneaked back to the mainland to carry out activities. This time, he was the Shanghai District "Special Commissioner" dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek secret service "Central Committee Second Group" to sneak back to the mainland to carry out activities. He said: "Now I feel that relying on the United States and relying on Chiang Kai-shek is unreliable. Only relying on the motherland can lead to a way out. So I have come to surrender myself and ask the government for leniency."

    弃暗投明
    晨光
    蒋介石特务机关“中央委员会第二组”派遣潜回大陆活动的“上海区特派员”张毅，在二月十六日向杭州市公安机关人员投案自首了。
    他向公安人员详细地叙述了他罪恶行当的经过。
    正当今年春节前几天，广东省人民委员会给港、澳同胞回乡过春节以各种便利的消息在香港传开了，很多人忙着整理行装，张毅也拿了一张“港澳居民春节回乡证”夹在香港回乡的居民中，混进大陆来了。
    二月九日，张毅在广州搭上了去上海的火车。
    张毅在车厢里看到旅客们都在愉快热情地交谈着，谁也没有注意他，他就回想起自己在港、澳时表现的那种恐惧，真是可笑已极，也后悔没有把电台随身带来。他在火车上开始寻找目标。当他发现有两个中国人民解放军的战士正在谈论军队里的生活情形的时候，他便凑了过去，企图弄点军事情报。他刚刚靠近一点，其中一个战士很注意地望了他一眼，就向另一个战士说：“咱们不谈这些了。”张毅并不因此就打消搜集情报的企图。他又继续寻找了另一个目标。一个不满二十岁的青年工人，正在和两位同伴谈着自己将从上海搬到东北去的事。张毅便装出一副“见面熟”的样子，钻进谈话的圈子里去，而且直接对着那个青年工人问起话来：
    “你是到东北去么？”
    “是的。”
    “你是干什么工作的呀？”
    没有得到回答。
    “你为什么要去东北呢？”
    这个青年工人冷冰冰地说：“为什么？为工作！”以下再也不说什么了。
    经过这两次试探之后，张毅的内心又开始紧张起来。觉得在这样的人当中活动太危险了。他找了一个不惹人注意的角落蜷伏起来，盘算下一步的计划。
    除夕这一天，火车到达杭州。张毅匆匆忙忙从车上下来，跑到冯山人巷四号史文霞的家里。
    史文霞是张毅过去很要好的朋友；她的丈夫史桐生也是张毅的朋友，过去在蒋军里做事，现在还在台湾。张毅想利用和史文霞的旧关系以及史的许多弱点，要她把自己掩护起来，以便进行活动。
    但是，事情总不是那么如意。在家里的主人却是史文霞的小姑史静霞。这个小姑见着他就把脸沉下来问道：
    “你是从哪里来的？”
    史静霞的带着怀疑的眼睛和紧绷绷的脸色，表示出她不欢迎这个来路不明的不速之客。张毅只好支支吾吾地说：
    “姐姐，我从香港来，特地来看你们的。”
    “我们生活得很好，没有什么好看的。”
    “这，我知道。不过，姐姐！你看我穿着这套香港的‘唐装’，实在太冷，又很特殊，怪不自在的，姐姐可不可以陪我去买一套棉衣服？”
    可是，这位“姐姐”却望着大门外回答说：“买衣服可要布票呀！我们的布票只够自己用。”
    这样，张毅只好无可奈何地转过话题，向她探问史文霞的情况。史静霞一连串不耐烦的回答，使张毅不能再问下去。
    这时候，史文霞的女儿史蒂华恰巧伏在桌上写信，张毅发现桌上放着一封下角写着“嘉兴市第二医院”的信封。从笔迹判断，这很可能是史文霞的来信。为了证实这点，张毅就对史静霞说：“姐姐！把那封文霞来的信给我看看吧！”
    “文霞来的信用不着你看。”
    不管史静霞的态度怎样冷淡，这句话却给他证明了史文霞的下落。但是天气这样冷，没有棉衣，没有住处，怎么办？这时候，他突然想到史文霞的弟弟史迪群，这个人解放前曾在国民党军队中作过事，找到他或许会有些办法。张毅就挨近带着红领巾的史蒂华说：“陪我上舅舅家去，好吗？”
    史蒂华也冷冰冰地说：“我不高兴！”
    张毅转手从口袋里拿出了一支派克钢笔，放在她面前说：“蒂华！香港来没带什么礼物，这支派克钢笔送给你吧！”
    这姑娘说：“我自己有！”
    他连忙说：“那么我们调换过来用，作个纪念吧！”蒂华也不换。他又顺手拿出一盒饼干，对蒂华说：“饼干！留给你吃吧！”这小姑娘看也不看，就回答：“我不要吃。”
    张毅碰了这一连串的钉子，窘得脸也红了。他正觉得非常尴尬的时候，史静霞走过来对他说：“你要是真的关心蒂华的话，请你看一看二月一日的浙江日报，周总理的报告上讲现在台湾愿意回大陆的人，可以回来了，过去犯过罪的，可以宽大他们，还可以给他们工作做。如果你知道蒂华爸爸在台湾的地址，告诉我们，也好写信把他叫回来，共产党是怎样说就怎样做的。”
    史静霞的这句话，像钉子一样钉在这个老特务的心上。张毅慌乱得只能支支吾吾地说：“蒂华爸爸在台湾，我在香港，他的情况我不大晓得。依我看，这种信还是不写好。……唔！时候不早了，我走了！”
    张毅狼狈地从史家走了出来。街上正是家家张灯结采，欢度除夕的时候。他身上绷了一件薄薄的夹衣，紧缩着脖子在零下五度的严寒里走过夜市，抱着最后的一点幻想，搭车往嘉兴去了。
    张毅跑进嘉兴第二医院的时候，史文霞正在值班。她对张毅的突然来临感到十分奇怪，不等张毅多说就对他说：“你最好同我们组织上谈谈去！”说着，就跑去报告了医院的负责人。
    史文霞的这个行动，对张毅是最沉重的当头棒。他在台湾订下的全部计划，到这里完全破产了。他不能不开始焦急地考虑起他的命运来。但意外的是，医院的院长却亲自来找他，亲切地招待他吃饭，而且还留他住下。这使张毅更加惶恐。
    旧历大年初一，张毅觉得史文霞对他的态度比昨天刚见面的时候缓和了些，还给他买了棉衣，而且还领他出去逛逛，并且向他介绍了社会主义改造高潮中的种种新事物。在谈话中，史文霞问到他在抗日战争时期曾经在上海一个国民党机关里做事的事，他沉默了半响，觉得实在不能隐瞒了，就支吾说是，“在‘中统局’做过事，抗日战争胜利以后，就一直做生意，为生活奔波到现在。参加‘中统’的事，在解放时已经向上海军管会交代了。”史文霞马上警告他说：“你不想想自己过去为谁服务，为谁出力，而现在，解放六、七年了，你还说这种话！”
    晚上，史文霞又带着张毅去看电影“天罗地网”。当银幕上出现一个“红领巾”的时候，张毅就联想起史蒂华和自己现在的处境。突然电影里那个“七号”特务被捕了，他心里不禁也“卜通”地一跳，紧张地吐了一口粗气。
    看完这场电影以后张毅的心绪很乱，很紧张。他想，无论如何是潜伏不下去了，今天不被抓起来，明天也要被抓起来。跑又跑不了，藏也藏不住。他想学电影里的那个“交通”，向公安机关投案自首。
    他走进了屋子，心神不定地望着史文霞，史文霞非常严肃地对他说：“说坦率些，我不信任你。”
    “那怎么办呢？”
    史文霞坚定地说：“政府相信你，我才会相信你。”
    这使他再不敢吭声了。
    二月十四日，史文霞回杭州去看女儿，张毅在嘉兴没有安身的地方，不得不跟着史文霞一同到杭州去。
    当天晚上，史文霞拿着二月一日的 “浙江日报”到张毅跟前，把周恩来总理的“政治报告”详细地读给他听，特别是把对台湾蒋介石集团军政人员的政策那一段，反复地读了几遍。史文霞又告诉他： “张毅！解放以后，我和我的女儿过着安定美满的生活，这个你亲眼看到了。而你和你的妻室儿女呢？几年来一直在外地东跑西奔，担惊受怕的，过着什么样的日子，你自己是亲身体验到的。一个人一辈子就这样结束了吗？你到底依靠谁呢？要是你这一次回到大陆来不是真心投靠祖国的话，你想想看，谁对你会放心呢？”
    当时，张毅简直不知道该怎样回答史文霞才好。但是有一点他很明白，就是史文霞说的一切都是正确的，他已经到了决定自己命运的严重的关口：是依靠美国和蒋介石呢，还是依靠祖国和人民呢？现在不能不有所选择了。于是，他对史文霞说：“我懂得你说的一切，你放心好了。我们的方向能够一致的。”
    这一夜，张毅一直没有睡着觉。他回想着他过的这十几年来罪恶的生活，回想着他潜回大陆以来的这几天的境况，回想着“天罗地网”电影中那个“七号”特务分子的下场，回想着史文霞对他的谈话和念给他听的“政治报告”。他在心里反来复去地默念着“政治报告”中和他关系最大的那几句：“……凡是愿意走和平解放台湾道路的，不管任何人，也不管他们过去犯过多大罪过，中国人民都将宽大对待，不究既往。……”
    第二天，史文霞和他女儿带着张毅一起去逛西湖。他们逛了解放后已经面目一新的中山公园，又同去瞻仰了经过整修的民族英雄岳飞的雄伟庙堂。然后他们沿着苏堤到了西山公园，这是解放后新建的大公园，这天游玩的人很多，个个都是那么愉快活泼。这一切，使张毅产生无穷的感慨。一路上，他默默无言，刚进门就向史文霞说：“时间不能再耽搁了，我要找地方投案去！”
    张毅在杭州市公安局城站派出所，向所长报告了他是蒋介石特务机关“中央委员会第二组”派来的特务，同时交出罪证，交代了自己的反革命历史。原来张毅是在1937年就参加了蒋介石的中统特务组织，在“青浦训练班”受过特务训练，后来又在上海一带进行过许多反共反人民的特务罪恶活动。解放时逃到台湾，又参加了美国特务机关“西方企业公司”受过训练，1950年曾潜回大陆活动过，这次是蒋介石特务机关“中央委员会第二组”派遣潜回大陆活动的上海区“特派员”。他说：“现在感到靠美国、靠蒋介石靠不住了。只有投靠祖国才有出路。所以特来自首，要求政府宽大处理。”
