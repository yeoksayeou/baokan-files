    Product Quality Exhibition Held
    The Xuzhou Joint State-Private Shanghai Match Factory recently held a match quality exhibition. At the exhibition, defective and waste products from each production process were displayed. Many letters from the people criticizing the factory's poor match quality were posted on large colored paper, and the situation in the fourth quarter of last year when department stores were unwilling to sell the factory's products was announced. The reasons for the production of defective and waste products were pointed out in the text descriptions. In the most prominent place, the physical objects and operational experience explanations of twelve advanced workers and one advanced group were displayed, as well as the match quality standard samples and text descriptions promulgated by the local industrial department.
    Visitors felt that they must consider the interests of consumers and improve product quality. Even those who did not pay attention to quality in the past have begun to pay attention to it.
    Such exhibitions can educate employees to care about whether their products are welcomed by the market, make them aware of the impact of poor product quality on national construction and people's lives, and thus consciously strive to improve product quality.

    举行产品质量展览
    徐州市公私合营大上海火柴厂，最近举行了一次火柴质量展览会。在会上，展出了每一生产工序的次品和废品；用大幅彩纸贴上了许多批评本厂火柴质量不好的人民来信，公布了去年第四季度百货公司一度不愿销售本厂产品的情形。在文字说明中，指出产生废品、次品的原因。在最显著的地方，陈列了十二个先进工人和一个先进小组的实物和操作经验说明，以及地方工业部颁布的火柴质量标准样品和文字说明。
    参观的人，都感到必须从消费者的利益着想，提高产品质量。连过去不重视质量的人，也都重视起来了。
    这样的展览会，可以教育职工关心自己的产品是否受到市场的欢迎，使他们知道产品质量低劣对国家建设和人民生活的影响，从而自觉地努力提高产品质量。
