Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, April 27th: Ceylon's Minister of Posts, Telecommunications, Broadcasting and Information, Mr. Marikar, announced on April 26th that from May 1st onwards, "Voice of America" will not be permitted to broadcast American propaganda in Ceylon without the Ceylon government's permission, whether it is overt or covert propaganda.

He said that "Voice of America" will have to submit a written copy of each broadcast to his ministry for approval. He also said that the agreement signed between the previous Kotelawala government and "Voice of America" regarding broadcasting from Ceylon was a completely "one-sided agreement."

He said that American broadcasting organizations would not be allowed to use Ceylon as a base for spreading propaganda to the vast regions of East Asia.

Reuters reported from Colombo on April 26th, quoting "official sources" in Ceylon, as saying that the implementation of inspections of "Voice of America" broadcasts was to prevent Ceylon from being used as a base for "hostile propaganda."

    锡兰当局宣布
    限制“美国之音”的广播
    新华社27日讯  科伦坡消息：锡兰邮电、广播和宣传部部长马里卡尔四月二十六日宣布，从五月一日起，“美国之音”非经锡兰政府许可，将不许在锡兰广播美国宣传，不管是公开的宣传或是隐蔽的宣传。
    他说，“美国之音”将必须把每项广播的书面副稿提交他的部批准。他又说，上届科特拉瓦拉政府同“美国之音”之间签订的关于从锡兰广播的协定完全是“片面的协定”。
    他说，将不许美国广播机构利用锡兰作为向东亚广大地区散布宣传的基地。
    路透社四月二十六日援引锡兰“官方人士”的话说，对“美国之音”广播实行检查是为了防止把锡兰作为进行“敌意宣传”的基地。
