Do More Concrete Work
Chen Ji

In the advanced producer movement, some state-owned enterprises in Jilin Province today hold a meeting to issue a new initiative, and tomorrow jointly propose some competition conditions. When the initiative is proposed, gongs and drums sound, and there is a response everywhere; after the initiative, it is deserted and there is no action.

Some people think that with an initiative, there is everything. However, realizing an initiative requires a lot of meticulous organizational work. For example, the four chartered train groups led by Li Shaoqiang, the driver of the Changchun Locomotive Depot, proposed the initiative of "locomotive daily transport of one million ton-kilometers." To realize this initiative, not only must all drivers be organized to pull more and run faster, but also various railway departments such as transportation, engineering, commerce, and electricity must be organized to do their jobs well. Neglecting the organizational work in one aspect will make it impossible to achieve the target of one million ton-kilometers per day. More than a month has passed since Li Shaoqiang and others proposed the initiative, but it has not been widely implemented. This is because the organization of traffic flow is not well done, and the requirements of drivers for pulling more and running faster cannot be met. Another example is that Cao Cunchang, an engineer from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, proposed an initiative to accelerate the training of technical talents using the chain method. The Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions issued a notice mobilizing enterprises throughout the province to respond to this initiative. However, due to the lack of specific organizational work, very few people actually implemented this method. These facts show that if leading departments at all levels do not do specific organizational work, no matter how many good initiatives are proposed, they will only be empty talk.

Some people believe that after a meeting is held and a mobilization report is made, the initiatives of advanced producers will be transformed into the actions of the broad masses of workers. Someone asked a branch secretary: "How do you respond to the initiative to improve quality?" The branch secretary said: "We have held many large and small meetings and emphasized quality." "What was the result?" "I haven't found out yet." People who are superstitious about meetings hold meetings, discussions, and mobilizations every day for initiatives and responses, but after proposing and responding to initiatives, they do not specifically solve problems. Therefore, many meetings are held, but very little concrete work is done. Some advanced producers are invited to meetings to make reports, and almost leave their jobs. Hu Nianrong, an advanced producer at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, spent only twenty-six hours producing on the machine tool in February, and the rest of the time was spent in meetings inside and outside the factory. Now Hu Nianrong is very anxious and cannot wholeheartedly study technology. Now many factories are experiencing a "material shortage" because labor efficiency has improved. In February, the Jilin Agricultural Tool Factory experienced shutdowns and idleness almost every day due to waiting for materials and parts. These factories spend a lot of time in meetings, but do very little concrete work to solve the problem of material supply.

Now we can no longer be satisfied with the superficially lively initiatives and responses. The most important thing is to do more concrete organizational work and solve more new problems raised in life! Hold fewer unproductive meetings!

    多做些具体工作
    陈迹
    在先进生产者运动中，吉林省有一些国营企业今天开会发出一个新的倡议，明天联名提出一些竞赛条件。倡议的时候，锣鼓喧天，到处响应；倡议过后，冷冷清清，没有行动。
    有些人以为有了倡议，就有了一切。殊不知实现一种倡议是要做许多细致的组织工作的。例如，长春机务段司机长李绍强等领导的四个包车组提出“机车日运百万吨公里”的倡议。要实现这个倡议，不但要组织所有司机都能多拉快跑，而且要组织车务、工务、商务、电务等各个铁路部门都能做好工作。忽视了一个方面的组织工作，就不能实现日运百万吨公里的指标。李绍强等提出倡议已经一个多月仍没普遍实行。这是因为车流的组织工作做得不好，不能满足司机多拉快跑的要求。又如，第一汽车制造厂工程师曹存昌提出倡议，用连锁法加速培养技术人才。吉林省工会联合会发出通知，动员全省企业响应这个倡议。但是由于缺少具体的组织工作，真正实行这个方法的，寥寥无几。这些事实说明，如果各级领导部门不做具体的组织工作，倡议再多再好，也只是空谈。
    有些人认为开了会，做了动员报告，就会把先进生产者的倡议变成广大工人群众的行动了。有人问一位支部书记：“你们怎样响应提高质量的倡议呀？”这个支部书记说：“我们大会小会都没少开，都强调了质量。”“结果怎样呢？”“还没了解。”迷信会议的人为了倡议和响应，天天开会、讨论、动员，但是在提出和响应倡议以后，又不具体地解决问题。所以，会开得很多，具体工作做得很少。有些先进生产者被邀去开会作报告，几乎离开工作岗位。第一汽车制造厂先进生产者胡年荣二月份在机床上生产的时间只有二十六小时，其余时间都在厂内厂外的会议中渡过了。现在胡年荣很着急，不能尽心地钻研技术。现在许多工厂因为劳动效率提高了，正在闹“材料荒”。吉林省农具厂二月份因为等待材料和部件，几乎天天发生停工、窝工现象。这些工厂开会时间很多，具体解决材料供应问题的工作却做得很少。
    现在再不能满足表面轰轰烈烈的倡议和响应了。最主要的，是多做些具体组织工作，多解决些生活中提出的新问题！少开些没有结果的会议！
