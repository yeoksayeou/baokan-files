    Zhejiang Province's successful modification of the double-wheeled, double-share plow for paddy fields has opened the way for the promotion of complete sets of new-style animal-powered farm implements in the southern paddy field areas. The use of the double-wheeled, double-share plow in rice paddies will play a significant role in striving for large-scale increases in rice production.

    Zhejiang Province, while retaining the original basic structure of the double-wheeled, double-share plow, modified it based on the characteristics of southern paddy fields. First, the iron upper furrow wheel and lower furrow wheel were replaced with wooden upper and lower furrow wheels with widened wheel widths and thickened wheel rims compared to the original iron wheels. Second, a plowshare cap made of flat iron was added to the front of the plowshare. Third, the grass board was widened and lengthened.

    After these modifications, the double-wheeled, double-share plow can be used in paddy fields with different soils, such as sandy loam and clay loam. According to key experiments conducted by several farms and agricultural cooperatives in Zhejiang in 1954 and the results of the promotion in some agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province last spring, under the same conditions of soil, fertilizer, and rice seed varieties, the use of the double-share plow can increase yield by 10 to 20 percent per mu compared to the use of native plows. For example, the paddy fields plowed with the double-share plow at Huangyan Farm yielded 483 jin per mu, 64 jin more than the fields plowed with native plows, an increase of 15.3%. The paddy fields plowed with the double-wheeled, double-share plow at Wangjiangjing Farm in Jiaxing County increased production by an average of more than 5% compared to the fields plowed with native plows, with the highest increase being 12.8% per mu.

    The modified double-wheeled, double-share plow is characterized by light pulling force and high efficiency. Its tillage efficiency is generally equivalent to more than two and a half native plows. The soil at Shuangqiao Farm in Jiaxing County is relatively sticky. In a continuous ten-day dry tillage comparison in paddy fields mixed with river mud, the double-wheeled, double-share plow tilled to a depth of five inches, averaging 0.663 mu per hour; the native plow tilled to a depth of 4.25 inches, averaging only 0.24 mu per hour. During the winter planting season, the Kaoxi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pujiang County could only till about one mu per day with native plows due to drought and hard ground; with the double-wheeled, double-share plow, they could till ten mu per day. Zhang Jinsheng, a labor model in Jiaxing County, said: "Plowing with a native plow makes your back ache and your arms sore, but the double-wheeled, double-share plow doesn't need to be held by a person, and it's fast and saves effort." Farmers in Jinhua County reflected: "When plowing with the double-wheeled, double-share plow, you can wipe your sweat and smoke, and you feel very happy while working." Members of the agricultural production cooperative in Wenling County summarized the advantages of the modified double-wheeled, double-share plow in paddy field cultivation as "seven goods," "four increases," and "four savings." "Seven goods": stable, deep, level, fast, even soil turning, fine soil crushing, and good grass covering. "Four increases": increase yield, increase members' income, improve soil fertility, and enhance crop drought resistance and lodging resistance. "Four savings": save labor, save animal power, save time, and save effort.

    The modified double-wheeled, double-share plow can not only plow the first, second, and third rounds in various soil types of paddy fields, but also perform various operations in the field. According to the experiments of Chen Chungui, a model worker in Zhejiang Province and Wangjiangjing Farm in Jiaxing County, by using the adjusting rod of the double-wheeled, double-share plow to raise the upper furrow wheel, it can not only plow the edges of the paddy fields and the corners, but also plow them evenly, straight, and neatly. By using the adjusting rod to adjust the plowshare and furrow wheel, the double-wheeled, double-share plow can also be maneuverable during small turns in the field, plowing evenly and straight, which solves the past problem of thinking that the double-share plow could not break ridges and make furrows. In addition, the plowshare can be removed, and the frame of the plow, the two wheels, and the structure of the regulator can be used for various comprehensive operations. For example, by removing the plowshare and installing a special "rice root cutting shovel," rice roots can be cut, killing overwintering rice borers lurking in the rice roots. According to key experiments in Zhejiang Province, one person managing one cow can shovel fifteen mu of rice roots per day. If the plowshare is removed and a special "subsoil shovel" is installed, it can not only deeply till and loosen the soil, but also prevent "salt reversion," which is beneficial to crop growth. Some places have experimented with installing a knife on the double-wheeled, double-share plow to remove weeds on the edges of the paddy fields. By removing the plow mouldboard, sweet potatoes can be dug and peanuts can be harvested. Zhejiang farmers praise the modified double-wheeled, double-share plow as the "all-purpose double-share plow." Therefore, agricultural production cooperatives in various places are vying to purchase it. Last year, Zhejiang sold more than 3,400 double-wheeled, double-share plows, exceeding the original promotion plan by 340%. This year, it is planned to supply 100,000 units. Women and semi-able-bodied laborers can use the modified double-wheeled, double-share plow. According to statistics up to the end of February, Zhejiang has trained more than 2,000 female double-wheeled, double-share plow operators, some of whom have already participated in spring plowing and production.

    浙江农民喜爱的“万能双铧犁”
    屠正峰
    浙江省改装双轮双铧犁下水田成功，为南方水田区推行成套的新式畜力农具开辟了道路。在水稻田使用双轮双铧犁，对于争取水稻的大面积丰产将发生很大作用。
    浙江省在保留双轮双铧犁原有基本结构的基础上，根据南方水田的特点，对双轮双铧犁进行了改装。第一，把铁制沟上轮和沟下轮改换为比原来铁轮的轮幅加宽、轮缘加厚的木制的沟上轮和沟下轮；第二，在犁铧的前部加装扁铁锻制的犁头套；第三，把滑草板加宽加长。
    双轮双铧犁经过这样的改装，能够在沙壤土、粘壤土等不同土壤的水田中使用。据1954年浙江几个农场和农业合作社重点试验和去年春天在全省部分农业生产合作社推广的结果证明，在土壤、肥料和水稻种子品种相同的情况下，使用双铧犁每亩可比使用土犁增产一至二成。如黄岩农场用双铧犁耕的水田每亩产量达483斤，比用土犁耕的田每亩多产六十四斤稻谷，即增产15.3％。嘉兴县王江泾农场用双轮双铧犁耕的水田比用土犁耕的水田平均增产5％以上，最高的每亩增产12.8％。
    改装的双轮双铧犁的特点是：拉力轻、效率高。它的耕作效率一般可抵两部半以上的土犁。嘉兴县双桥农场土壤比较粘，在捻有河泥的草子田里进行连续十天的干耕对比，双轮双铧犁耕深五寸，平均每小时耕田六分六厘三毫；土犁耕深四分二厘五，平均每小时只耕二分四厘。浦江县考溪农业生产合作社冬种的时候，因天旱地硬，用土犁每天只耕一亩左右；用双轮双铧犁每天可耕地十亩。嘉兴县劳动模范张金生说：“土犁耕田腰酸、臂疼，双轮双铧犁不用人扶，又快又省力。”金华县农民反映：用双轮双铧犁耕田，揩汗吸烟都行，干起活来很愉快。温岭县的农业生产合作社社员把改装后的双轮双铧犁在水田耕作的优点总结成“七好”、“四增”、“四省”。“七好”：稳、深、平、快、翻土匀、碎土细、盖草好。“四增”：增加产量、增加社员收入、增进土壤肥力、增强作物抗旱和抗倒伏的能力。“四省”：省劳力、省畜力、省时间、省力气。
    改装的双轮双铧犁不仅在各种土壤的水田中头、二、三遍都可以翻耕，而且能进行田间的各种操作。据浙江省模范工作者、嘉兴县王江泾农场陈春桂的试验，利用双轮双铧犁调节杆，把沟上轮调节高，不但能耕田塍边和田角，而且耕得又平、又直、又齐。利用调节杆调节犁铧和沟轮，还能使双轮双铧犁在田间操作的小转弯的时候也灵巧，耕得既平又直，这就解决了过去认为双铧犁不能破畦作畦的问题。此外，还可以拆下犁铧，利用犁体的架子、两个轮子和调节器的结构来进行各项综合作业。如拆下犁铧装上特制的“切稻根铲”，可以切割稻根，杀死潜伏在稻根里的越冬螟虫。据浙江省重点试验的结果，一头牛拉、一个人管，每天可铲稻根十五亩，如果拆下犁铧装上特制的“心土铲”，不仅能深耕松土，还可以防止“反盐”，有利于作物的生长。有些地方试验在双轮双铧犁上加装一把刀，能铲除田塍边的杂草。拿下犁镜，还可以挖甘薯、掘花生。浙江农民称赞改装后的双轮双铧犁为“万能双铧犁”。因此，各地农业生产合作社都争着购买。去年浙江推销了三千四百多部双轮双铧犁，超过原定推广计划的340％。今年计划供应十万部。改装的双轮双铧犁，妇女和半劳动力都能使用，根据到二月底的统计，浙江已经训练了二千多名女双轮双铧犁手，其中有些人已经参加春耕生产。
