The Inconvenience of Bicycle Repair

In many cities, numerous vehicle repair stalls are distributed along major traffic arteries and suburban roadsides, which perfectly meets the needs of residents. However, in the handicraft industry cooperative movement, some areas simply concentrated them, causing great inconvenience to the masses. After the bicycle repair industry in Qingdao was organized, the number of service points was reduced by two-thirds. The Beishi District of Shenyang City formed a cooperative with 110 households and 220 bicycle repairers, setting up 20 service points and removing 90 service points. One customer's bicycle broke down and couldn't find a repair stall, so he took a pedicab to find a store. He finally found one, but the store had already put up a "closed" sign. In Jia Town, Haimen County, Jiangsu Province, the bicycle repair service points within a radius of more than ten miles were also removed, and the masses had to carry their broken bicycles to the town for repair.

Waiting in Line to Shoe Soles

The footwear industry in Qingdao originally had 481 small stalls, with 489 people, distributed in every corner of the city. Residents could find a shoe sole stall just outside the alley or within dozens of households. Since the organization, the original 222 households and 223 people in the Sifang, Shinan, and Taixi districts have been divided into thirteen large groups and established ninety service points. The masses reflected: "After cooperativization, even places to shoe soles are hard to find." Jiangning County in Jiangsu Province also centralized all shoe businesses, and the masses had to queue up to shoe soles, pay, and pick up their shoes.

No Place to Make Shirts

The sewing industry in the Xidan District of Beijing originally had 460 sewing service points. After being organized, more than 200 points were removed. The sewing industry in Wuhan City had 1,871 households, which formed three cooperatives and only set up 261 points. The 29th Sewing Cooperative in Xinhua District, Tianjin City, concentrated 122 households into thirteen points. The 10th Sewing Cooperative in Changchun City also concentrated twenty-two service points together for production. As a result, citizens have to travel a long way to make clothes. Before the Spring Festival, a citizen ran from Jianshe Street to Stalin Avenue, and then from Stalin Avenue to Guiyang Street, just to make a shirt to wear for the holiday. After running for half a day, he couldn't find a place to make it. The reason is that there are fewer service points, some stores do not accept odd jobs, and some, although they do, have very long delivery times. The citizen sighed and said, "Cooperativization is good, but it's inconvenient."

Dozens of People Squeezed Together

In the high tide of handicraft industry cooperativization, some cooperatives in Beijing, disregarding the specific conditions of factories, equipment, and cadres, were overeagerly and reluctantly concentrated for production, causing confusion in production and management. The Materialware Cooperative in Chongwen District concentrated fifty members in one room for production, with one blowtorch per person, filling the room with smoke. With a small room and many people, even in winter, the members wore single shirts, and some were sweating even with their backs bare. This not only hinders production but also affects the health of the members. The 5th Basket Weaving Cooperative in Beijing has a total of forty members, all concentrated in production. As a result, the workshop and the pool for soaking wickers are not enough, and there is a serious phenomenon of work stoppages, and the soaking time of wickers is shortened, reducing product quality. The Woodware Cooperative in Chongwen District, after being concentrated, had no factory building, so they produced in a temple. There were no electric lights in the temple, and the light was poor, so they got off work at four o'clock every afternoon.

Special Skills "Taken Away"

In the high tide of handicraft industry cooperativization in Shenyang City, the method of "using the many to bring the few, using the large to bring the small" was adopted, and some products with higher technical skills were "taken away." For example, handicraft workers who produce erhu strings were merged into silk thread cooperatives to produce silk threads; Huanggu District merged those who made crucibles into confectionery cooperatives to make sugar coating workers. The "Guzipi" watch strap industry, which used to sell well in Japan and Korea and now sells well in Northeast China, has also been merged into the decoration cooperative to produce large belts. The eight handicraft workers in the city who make developer were organized into the 8th Chemical Cooperative to produce "three acids." Because they are not experts in producing "three acids," they can only be auxiliary workers now. This practice not only reduces the income of the members and affects market supply, but also violates the principle of maintaining special skills.

### 盲目集中的恶果

    盲目集中的恶果
    修理自行车不方便
    在许多城市中，不论是交通要道，或是市郊的公路边上，总是分布着很多修理车辆的摊子，这是完全适合于居民需要的。但是在手工业合作化运动中，某些地区，简单地把他们集中起来，给群众造成极大不便。青岛市自行车修理业组织起来后，服务点减少了三分之二。沈阳市北市区将一百一十户、二百二十人的自行车修理者组成一个社，设了二十个服务点，撤掉了九十个服务点。有一个顾客的自行车坏了，找不到修理的摊子，就坐三轮车找门市部，好不容易的找上了，但是门市部已经挂上了“下班”的牌子。江苏海门县四甲镇也把周围十多里的自行车修理服务点撤销了，群众的自行车坏了还要扛到镇上去修理。
    绱鞋要排队
    青岛市靴鞋业原来有481个小摊，489人，分布在全市的每个角落。居民一出胡同口，或走上几十家门口，就可以找到一个绡鞋摊。自从组织起来以后，四方、市南、台西三个区原222户、223人，被分成十三个大组，建立九十个服务点。群众反映道：“合作化了，连绱鞋的地方也找不到了”。江苏省江宁县也把鞋业全部集中，群众绱鞋、付钱和取鞋都要排队。
    衬衫没地方做
    北京市西单区缝纫业原有460个缝纫服务点，组织起来后，撤掉了二百多个点。武汉市缝纫业有1，871户，组成了三个合作社，只设261个点。天津市新华区第二十九缝纫社，把122户集中为十三个点。长春市第十缝纫社也把二十二个服务点集中在一起生产。因此，市民做衣服要跑很多路。春节前，有一个市民，为了做一件过节穿的衬衫，从建设街跑到斯大林大街，又从斯大林大街跑到贵阳街，跑了半天，还找不到一个承做的地方。原因是服务点少了，有些门市部又不接零活，有的虽接零活，但是交货期太长。这个市民叹气说：“合作化好是好，就是不方便。”
    几十个人挤在一起
    在手工业合作化的高潮中，北京市有些合作社不顾厂房、设备和干部等具体条件，过急地勉强地集中起来生产，造成了生产和管理的混乱。崇文区料器社把五十个社员集中到一间房子里生产，每人一盏吹火灯，油烟满屋。房小人多，即使在冬天，社员们也穿着单褂，有的人赤着背也冒汗。这既妨碍生产，又妨碍社员的健康。北京市第五编筐社共有社员四十人，全部集中生产。结果车间和泡荆条的池子不够用，窝工现象很严重，并且还缩短了泡荆条的时间，降低了产品质量。崇文区木器社，集中起来后没有厂房，就到庙里生产。庙里没有电灯，光线不好，每天下午四点多钟就下班。
    特种技艺“带”掉了
    沈阳市在手工业合作化高潮中，采取了“以多带少、以大带小”的方法，把一些技艺性较高的产品都“带”掉了。如把生产胡琴弦的手工业者并入丝线社去生产丝线；皇姑区把做坩埚的并入糖果社去做包糖工。过去畅销日本、朝鲜，现在行销东北的“骨子皮”表带业，也被并进装具社去生产大皮带了。全市做显影剂的八个手工业者，被组织到第八化学社去生产“三酸”，因为他们对生产“三酸”是外行，现在只能当辅助工。这种做法不仅使社员的收入减少，影响市场供应，而且违反了保持特种技艺的原则。
