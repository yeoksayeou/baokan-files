    The Jilin Province Agricultural Water Conservancy Advanced Producers and Advanced Workers Representative Conference was held in Changchun City on March 23. More than 1,000 advanced producers and advanced workers attending the meeting extensively exchanged advanced production experiences and discussed how to overfulfill this year's production plan of 6.6 million tons of grain. Many advanced producers expressed their intention to actively launch a socialist agricultural production increase movement and conscientiously learn from advanced experiences.
