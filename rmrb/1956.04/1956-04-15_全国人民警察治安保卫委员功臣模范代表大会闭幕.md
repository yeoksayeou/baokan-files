Xinhua News Agency, April 14th - The National People's Police, Public Security Committee, Hero and Model Representatives Congress concluded today.

    Minister of Public Security Luo Ruiqing delivered a report at the meeting this morning. Luo Ruiqing said that the deeds described by the representatives attending this meeting in their speeches vividly illustrated what style and qualities a people's police officer and public security personnel should possess, namely: maintaining constant vigilance, being brave, intelligent, and resolute, conducting investigations and research, being realistic, maintaining contact with the masses, and observing discipline. Luo Ruiqing pointed out: Among these styles and qualities, close contact with the masses has particularly important significance. Connecting with the masses, relying on the masses, and serving the people are the fundamental characteristics of the people's public security work. Counter-revolutionaries are most afraid of us uniting with the masses. We must go deep among the masses, do more good things for the people, and be a good logistics worker for the people. We must obtain the criticism and supervision of the people towards the people's public security work, so as to overcome shortcomings in a timely manner and promote the progress of our work. Luo Ruiqing finally encouraged all representatives to study hard, improve their awareness, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, be humble and cautious, and strive to safeguard the victorious completion of the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    In the afternoon, Vice Ministers of Public Security Xu Zirong, Zhou Xing, and Wang Zhao presented awards to the hero and model representatives of the criminal, armed police, economic, household registration, fire control, traffic, and water police, as well as the hero and model representatives of urban and rural public security committees who attended the conference. The conference also awarded each representative an exquisite commemorative medal.

    Finally, Vice Minister of Public Security Zhou Xing delivered the closing speech of the conference.

    全国人民警察治安保卫委员功臣模范代表大会闭幕
    新华社14日讯　全国人民警察、治安保卫委员功臣模范代表大会今天闭幕。
    公安部部长罗瑞卿上午在会上作了报告。罗瑞卿说，出席这次大会的代表们在大会发言中叙述的事迹，生动地说明了作为一个人民警察和治安保卫人员应该具备什么作风和品质，这就是：要经常保持警惕性，要勇敢、聪明、坚定，要调查研究、实事求是，要联系群众，要守纪律。罗瑞卿指出：在这些作风和品质中，密切联系群众有特别重要的意义。联系群众、依靠群众、为人民群众服务，是人民公安工作的根本特点。反革命分子最怕我们和群众结合起来。我们要深入群众，多为人民办好事，为人民群众当一个很好的勤务员。要取得人民群众对人民公安工作的批评和监督，以便及时克服缺点，推动工作前进。罗瑞卿最后勉励全体代表要努力学习，提高觉悟，戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，为保卫祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的胜利完成而努力。
    下午，由公安部副部长徐子荣、周兴、王昭分别授予出席大会的刑事、武装、经济、户籍、消防、交通、水上等警种的功臣模范代表，城市和农村的治安保卫委员功臣模范代表等以奖品。大会还授予全体代表每人一个精美的纪念章。
