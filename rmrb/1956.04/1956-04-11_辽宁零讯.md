	Liaoning News Briefs
	The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company's machinery repair plant recently manufactured a batch of enlarged capacity excavator buckets. As the frozen soil thaws, many excavators will need to be fitted with the new buckets. It is estimated that after increasing the capacity of the existing 0.5 cubic meter buckets to one cubic meter in Anshan, an additional 420,000 cubic meters of earthwork can be completed this year.
	The three canneries in Liaoning Province - Lushun-Dalian, Jinzhou, and Yingkou - plan to produce more than 600 tons of four types of canned vegetables this year, including pickled cucumbers, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and green beans, to meet export needs. In addition, they plan to utilize the abundant aquatic resources along the Liaoning coast to trial-produce sixteen types of canned fish and shrimp for export, including canned mackerel, which is of great interest to international friends.
	Xia Changfu, a technician at the rubber workshop of the Shenyang Battery Factory, recently improved the formula for the rubber of battery small caps, replacing the original No. 1 raw rubber with No. 5 raw rubber, and replacing bakelite powder with powder made from crushed waste battery casings. After assessment by the technical department, the quality of the products after the formula improvement fully meets the requirements, and the color is more beautiful, which can save the state more than 50,000 yuan annually.
