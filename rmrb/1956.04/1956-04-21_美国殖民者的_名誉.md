International Notes:

	The "Reputation" of American Colonialists

	There's an old saying in capitalist society: those in the same trade are enemies. — The infighting between American and British colonialists in the Middle East and Near East demonstrates this relationship. On April 4th, the British "Daily Mail" wrote in an editorial: "Britain and America have disputes in the Middle East. Their interests are the same, yet they do not have a common policy. Whenever the United States takes action, it is often against Britain."

	This kind of argument from the "Daily Mail" is not without basis. It was immediately confirmed in American newspapers. Also on April 4th, the Washington "Star" published an article written by Constantine Brown. This author said triumphantly: "Due to Britain's setbacks... the United States has replaced Britain as the protector of Western interests in the Middle East. Britain has abandoned some of its traditional tasks in this most troublesome region of the world and has been deprived of many others."

	Brown believes that Britain is right to "abandon" its traditional influence in the Middle East and Near East; as for the United States, Brown says, "No matter how unwilling (?) we are to expand our already numerous entanglements in the world, abandonment is impossible." Brown said: "The fact that the United States is taking on a leading role among Western countries in the Middle East could be a good thing. If we are both clever and lucky, there is certainly an opportunity for the free world to benefit greatly."

	For some reason, Brown did not clearly explain what "benefits" the "free world" would gain from this. He only mentioned one point: "The rapid development of the region's huge oil resources has already put the United States in a leading position in economic affairs."

	Of course, things are not so "lucky," and Brown finally discovered "a lot of headaches," which is "all the hatred and resentment" accumulated by the people of the Middle East and Near East against the colonialists over the centuries. So, Brown began to sing a charming tune, saying: "The United States itself does not have the legacy of being hated for a long time in that region of the world like Britain; the United States has never been a colonial country that the entire colonial world is extremely afraid of and looks down upon. ...We must make the most of our past reputation..."

	But what kind of "reputation" is it? Ask the people of the Middle East and Near East. They have long seen through British colonialism and also seen through American colonialism; they resist the aggression and plunder of British colonialists, and they also resist the aggression and plunder of American colonialists. Therefore, the British magazine "Economist" once reported: "Among the people of these countries, the term 'pro-British' is a shameful curse word, and the term 'pro-American' is not much different from it."

	If there is any difference between American colonialism and British colonialism, it is that American colonialism has even more arrogant ambitions. As Shukairy, the Syrian representative to the United Nations, said, the United States "supports colonialism everywhere in the world, which is to regard the entire world as its colony. I think this is the worst kind of colonialism." This is an answer to the American colonialism that Brown is trying to whitewash. (Qi)

### 美国殖民者的“名誉”

    美国殖民者的“名誉”
    在资本主义社会里有一句俗话：同行是冤家。——美国殖民者和英国殖民者在中近东地区的勾心斗角就表现了这种关系。四月四日，英国“每日邮报”的社论写道：“英国和美国在中东有争执。它们的利益是相同的，然而它们却没有共同的政策。只要美国有所行动，那常常是反对英国的。”
    “每日邮报”的这种论调并不是没有根据的。它在美国报纸上立刻得到了证实。恰恰也是四月四日，美国华盛顿“明星报”发表了康斯坦丁·布朗写的一篇文章。这个作者得意洋洋地说：“由于英国遭到了挫折，……美国已经代替英国而成为西方在中东地区的利益的保卫者了。英国放弃了它在世界上这个最多事的地区的一些传统的任务，又被剥夺了其他许许多多传统的任务。”
    布朗认为，英国“放弃”它在中近东的传统势力是应该的；至于美国呢，布朗说：“不论我们多么不愿意（？）扩大我们在世界上已经很多了的牵连，而放弃是不可能的事”。布朗说：“美国在中东担负起一个西方国家的领导地位的角色这件事情很可能会是一件好事情。如果我们又伶俐又幸运，那末自由世界得到很大好处的机会肯定是存在的。”
    由于某种原因，布朗没有解释清楚“自由世界”究竟将因此得到那些“好处”。他只提到一点：“这个地区的巨大石油资源的迅速开发已经使美国在经济事务方面又占了主要的地位。”
    当然，事情并不那么“幸运”，布朗终于发现了“一大堆头痛的事情”，这就是：中近东各国人民几世纪以来对殖民者所积起的“全部仇恨和愤懑”。于是，布朗就唱起迷人的调子来，他说：“美国本身并不具有英国在世界那个地区的那种长期被人憎恨的遗产；美国从来就不是世界上的整个殖民地区所极其惧怕的和看不起的殖民国家。……我们必须尽量利用我们过去的名誉……”
    但是，究竟是什么样的“名誉”呢？还是问一问中近东各国的人民吧。他们早就看透了英国的殖民主义，也同样看透了美国的殖民主义；他们反抗着英国殖民者的侵略和掠夺，也同样反抗着美国殖民者的侵略和掠夺。因此，英国“经济学家”杂志也曾经报道说：“在这些国家的人民中间，
  ‘亲英分子’这个名词是一个可耻的骂人的字眼，而‘亲美分子’这个名词也同它没有多大区别。”
    如果说美国殖民主义同英国殖民主义有什么区别，那就是美国的殖民主义野心要更加狂妄。叙利亚驻联合国代表舒凯里说得好，美国“支持世界各处的殖民主义，这就是把整个世界看作它的殖民地。我认为这是一种最坏的殖民主义。”这就是对于布朗所力图粉饰的美国殖民主义的一个回答。（齐）
