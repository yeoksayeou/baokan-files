Panchen Erdeni's Speech

Respected Head of the Central Delegation, Vice Premier Chen, Representative Zhang, Deputy Heads of Delegation Vice Chairman Wang and comrades:

Today, at this auspicious, warm, and historically significant welcome rally, I would like to first express my utmost excitement and joy, and extend a warm welcome, heartfelt gratitude, and a respectful salute to the Head of the Central Delegation, Vice Premier Chen, Representative Zhang, Deputy Heads of Delegation Vice Chairman Wang, and representatives of brotherly ethnic groups from all regions of our great motherland, who have come to Tibet from our motherland's great capital, Beijing, enduring hardship and traveling thousands of miles.

Just as the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is about to be established, the Central Delegation has come to Tibet, bringing with them the deep concern and love of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao for the people of Tibet, as well as many valuable instructions and the profound friendship of the brotherly ethnic groups of the motherland. This will further consolidate and develop the unity among all ethnic groups of the motherland and the internal unity of Tibet, further develop various construction undertakings in Tibet, and enable the people of Tibet to gradually enter socialist society together with the brotherly ethnic groups of the motherland.

Please allow me to once again extend a warm welcome, heartfelt gratitude, and a respectful salute to the Head of the Central Delegation, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and all the Deputy Heads of Delegation and all comrades.

Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in China!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live our beloved and great leader Chairman Mao!

    班禅额尔德尼的讲话敬爱的中央代表团团长、陈副总理，张代表、汪副主任等副团长和各位同志：
    今天在这个吉祥、热烈和有重大历史意义的欢迎大会上，我首先以万分兴奋愉快的心情，向中央代表团团长陈副总理，张代表、汪副主任等副团长和祖国各地区的兄弟民族代表，从我们祖国伟大首都北京，不辞辛劳，万里跋涉光临西藏，表示热烈的欢迎，衷心的感谢，并致以崇高的敬礼。
    正当西藏自治区筹备委员会将要成立的时候，中央代表团来到西藏，给我们带来了中共中央、中央人民政府和毛主席对西藏人民深切的关怀和爱护，以及许多宝贵的指示，带来了祖国各兄弟民族的深厚友谊。这就会使祖国各民族间的团结和西藏内部的团结，愈加巩固和发展，就会使西藏的各项建设事业更加发展，就会使西藏人民和祖国各兄弟民族一起逐步的进入社会主义社会。
    请允许我再一次的向中央代表团团长陈毅副总理和全体副团长、全体同志，表示热烈的欢迎，衷心的感谢，并致以崇高的敬礼。
    中国各民族人民大团结万岁！
