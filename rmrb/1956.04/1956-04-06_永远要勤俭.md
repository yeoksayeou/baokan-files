    Always Be Diligent and Frugal
    With the basic realization of agricultural cooperation in most parts of the country, it is now clear that there is a huge potential buried in China's agricultural production. This enormous potential has begun to be realized. Thus, an urgent question is brought before us: How should the huge potential power of hundreds of millions of farmers in production be used, and where should it be used?
      The joint directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and frugally clearly points out the correct way to use this huge force, which is: running cooperatives diligently and frugally, and first concentrating major efforts on developing production.
    Everyone knows that in the deep mountains of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, there is the Jianming Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative led by Wang Guofan. It is famous for "running the cooperative diligently and frugally". More than three years ago, it was a cooperative of "twenty-three poor peasant households with only three donkey legs, known as the 'poverty cooperative'". Comrade Mao Zedong praised this cooperative in the editor's note to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside." He said: "They used their own efforts to 'bring from the mountains' a large number of means of production in three years, which moved some visitors to tears. I think this is the image of our entire country." In January of this year, this cooperative merged with three other cooperatives to form a fully socialist cooperative. Did they forget to run the cooperative diligently and frugally just because they ran a large-scale advanced cooperative? Not at all. Today's edition of this newspaper publishes an article by Wang Guofan introducing their continued adherence to running the cooperative diligently and frugally. Acting under the slogan of "promoting the glorious tradition of running cooperatives diligently and frugally," they created greater "diligence" achievements and adopted better "frugality" methods. This is true socialist spirit, fully in line with the principles of managing a socialist economy.
    Many agricultural production cooperatives, like the Jianming Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Cooperative, have adhered to the management policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally. However, there are also some agricultural production cooperatives that do not operate in this way.
    The Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lengshuigou Township, Licheng County, Shandong Province, is an advanced cooperative formed by merging nine primary cooperatives. In a situation where the cooperative's production funds are still very insufficient, the leaders of the cooperative plan to buy large trucks, film projectors, etc., this year, worth a total of about 55,000 yuan, which is equivalent to the value of the grain produced by 1,900 mu of land (accounting for 25% of the cooperative's cultivated land) in a whole year. By mid-February, more than 1,800 yuan had already been spent on buying sewing machines, sports equipment, entertainment supplies, etc., as well as film fees and expenses for tea, cigarettes, candy and other refreshments (which could have bought twenty waterwheels). These non-productive expenditures have made the difficulty of insufficient production funds in the cooperative even more serious. The Licheng County Party Committee has helped the cooperative revise its expenditure plan and corrected this phenomenon. It is worth noting that the Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative is not the only one with this situation. Similar phenomena have occurred in many places.
    Where does this unhealthy trend of extravagance and waste come from? The problem does not mainly lie with the members. Some of these things are done by the backbone members of the cooperative, who talk about "show" and flaunt "generosity." Not long after the cooperative was established, before production has even reached a high level, they believe that after running a large-scale advanced cooperative, "the family is big and the business is big, spending a few more dollars doesn't matter," and that "a large cooperative must be generous, otherwise it won't look like socialism." There are also some backbone members of the cooperative who are unwilling to buy things that are not urgently needed for production, but the cadres leading the cooperative criticize them for being "too conservative," and they have no choice but to follow suit. Some of these leading cadres who criticize others for being "conservative" are even county party secretaries. Under the direct guidance of Liang Junyi, the secretary of the Yingcheng County Party Committee in Hubei, the county party committee spared no expense to create a "new atmosphere" in an advanced cooperative in Shengtan Township, the county party committee's key township. This cooperative already had a lot of cultural and sports supplies, and also spent more than 1,000 yuan to buy reed organs, phonographs, sports uniforms, and other things. They built extensively, having already built twelve office buildings (not including those that were demolished and rebuilt), and built very large pigsties and cowsheds at the crossroads next to the highway. For this reason, thirty-two peasant households were forced to move, and more than a dozen houses were demolished. The cooperative's expenditure on adding cultural and recreational supplies and building houses has already exceeded 246,000 yuan, while the more than 30,000 yuan needed for spring ploughing production this year has not yet been secured, and the living difficulties of 98 cooperative members have not been resolved. Initially, when Liang Junyi proposed to expand the "new atmosphere," some people raised different opinions, and the members were not "active" when working. After he found out, he scolded the township branch secretary for being "useless" and wanted to replace the work team leader. From then on, the cooperative had no choice but to "work hard." In this way, from one cooperative to several townships, and from several townships to the entire county, a trend was formed.
    Some central and local business departments assign work without distinguishing between primary and secondary, prior and subsequent, important and unimportant, urgent and slow, requiring everyone to advance together and start at the same time, which also disperses the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of many agricultural production cooperatives. This method of striving to complete tasks ahead of schedule or exceeding quotas has made it difficult for cooperatives to cope. Many tasks that are not directly related to production have rushed into the agricultural production cooperatives from above, breaking through their production plans and financial plans. According to comrades in Hebei Province, there are no less than a dozen such tasks assigned by various departments at the higher level in many counties (including building roads, installing telephones, building sports fields, building clubs, etc.), which require a large amount of manpower and financial resources to complete, and all the manpower used must be recorded in the agricultural production cooperative's work-day accounts. Some are not counted as work-days, but they also take up a large part of the time of a large number of people.
    The intentions and enthusiasm of the people who assign the tasks are naturally very good, and these things are all good things, things that should be done and must be done, and they are all stipulated in the draft National Agricultural Development Program. The problem is: these good things can never be done all at once. The National Agricultural Development Program is a twelve-year work program, which stipulates that some items must be completed within three, five, or seven years, and does not stipulate that they must all be completed within one year or half a year. If it can indeed be completed ahead of schedule, that is naturally too good. However, whether it can be done ultimately depends not only on the various departments that assign the tasks themselves, but also on the whole of the national economy and culture, on the coordination and collaboration between departments, and on the communication between the leading organs and the people.
    In recent months, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the struggle against conservatism has achieved great success. However, it is necessary to prevent and oppose the abuse and distortion of this slogan, and to prevent and oppose turning it into a tool of coercion and command, or into a means for certain individualists to show off. In some places, the correct slogan of "opposing conservatism" has been abused by some people. They have not made it clear: is it "conservative" to first concentrate major efforts on production, and to improve living standards on the basis of greatly improving the level of production? Or is it "conservative" to disperse and waste manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and to slow down the rate of increasing production? Of course, running cooperatives is to make everyone's life better, and the members of the cooperative are all willing to make their material and cultural lives better; however, they fully understand: a tree without roots cannot survive, and a flower without roots will not bloom for long; if you eat the seeds, there will be no harvest, and if you kill the hen, there will be no more eggs.
    Every agricultural production cooperative should take Article 24 of the National Agricultural Development Program as its management policy: "All agricultural production cooperatives must implement the principle of running the cooperative diligently and frugally. Diligence means fully mobilizing the members to work hard in production, expand the scope of production, develop diverse economies, and carry out meticulous work. Frugality means practicing strict economy, reducing production costs, and opposing extravagance and waste." This is the true socialist spirit.
    Our working people have always regarded diligence and frugality as virtues, and extravagance and waste as shameful. This virtue should not be interrupted when transitioning to the socialist path, but should be greatly promoted. We must always be diligent and frugal.

    永远要勤俭
    在全国绝大部分地区基本上实现了农业合作化的情况下，已经可以明显地看出，我国的农业生产中埋藏着巨大的潜力。这巨大的潜力已经开始发挥出来。于是，一个迫切的问题提到了我们的面前：几万万农民在生产上的巨大潜在力量，应该怎样使用，应该用于何处？
      中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的联合指示，明确地指出了运用这巨大的力量的正确途径，这就是：勤俭办社，首先集中主要力量发展生产。
    大家都知道，在河北省遵化县的深山里，有一个王国藩领导的建明农林牧生产合作社。它是以“勤俭办社”出名的。三年多以前，它是“二十三户贫农只有三条驴腿，被人称为‘穷棒子社’”的一个合作社。毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”的编者按语中表扬了这个合作社。他说：“他们用自己的努力，在三年时间内，‘从山上取来’了大批的生产资料，使得有些参观的人感动得下泪。我看这就是我们整个国家的形象。”今年一月，这个合作社已经同别的三个社合并，建成了完全社会主义性质的合作社。他们是不是办了大型的高级社就忘了勤俭办社呢？完全没有。今天本报发表的王国藩的文章介绍了他们继续坚持勤俭办社的情形。他们在“发扬勤俭办社的光荣传统”的口号下行动起来，创造了更大的“勤”的成绩，采取了更好的“俭”的办法。这是真正的社会主义精神，完全合乎经营社会主义经济的原则。
    有许多农业生产合作社，像建明农林牧合作社一样，坚持了勤俭办社的经营方针。可是，也有一些农业生产合作社，却不是这样办的。
    山东省历城县冷水沟乡有一个东方红农业生产合作社，是由九个初级社合并办成的高级社。在社内生产资金还很不充足的情况下，社里的领导人员就打算在今年买大卡车、电影放映机等等，共值五万五千元左右，相当于一千九百亩地（占这个社的耕地的25％）全年生产的粮食的价值。到二月中旬为止，买缝纫机、体育用品、娱乐用品等等以及电影费、烟茶糖果招待费，已经开支了一千八百多元（可以买二十部水车）。这些非生产性的开支，使社内生产资金不足的困难更加严重了。历城县委已经帮助这个合作社修订了开支计划，纠正了这种现象。值得注意的是，并不是只有东方红农业生产合作社有这种情形。类似的现象，在许多地方都发生了。
    这股铺张浪费的歪风是从什么地方吹出来的呢？毛病主要地不在社员身上。这些事情，有一些是社里的骨干分子做的，他们讲“排场”，耍“阔气”，合作社成立不久，生产还没有见个高低，就认为：办了大型的高级社以后，“家大业大，多花几个钱不算什么”，“大社就得讲大方，不然就不像个社会主义的样子”。也有一些合作社的骨干分子是不愿意买生产上并不急需的东西的，可是领导办社的干部批评他们“太保守”，他们只好跟着作起来了。这些批评人家“保守”的领导干部，有的竟是县委书记。湖北应城县委在县委书记梁俊义的直接指导下，在县委重点乡盛滩乡的一个高级社中，不惜巨款制造“新气象”。这个合作社已经有了不少文娱体育用品，还用一千多元买了风琴、留声机、运动服等等东西。他们大兴土木，已经建成了十二栋办公室（拆旧换新的还不在内），在公路旁十字路口修建了很大的猪圈和牛棚。为此，强迫三十二户农民搬家，拆毁了十几栋房屋。这个社用于添置文娱用品和修建房屋的费用已有二十四万六千多元，而今年春耕生产所需要的三万多元资金还没有着落，九十八户社员生活困难还没有解决。最初，当梁俊义提出要扩大“新气象”的时候，就有人提出过不同的意见，社员工作时也不“积极”，他知道以后就骂乡支部书记“没有啥用”，并且要撤换工作组长。从这以后，这个社只好“大干”起来了。就这样，由一个社到几个乡，由几个乡到全县，形成了风气。
    中央和地方某些业务部门布置工作不分主次、先后、轻重、缓急，要大家齐头并进，同时动手，也分散了许多农业生产合作社的人力、物力、财力。这种事事争取提前或超额完成的办法，已经使得合作社难以应付。许多同生产没有直接关系的任务从上边冲到农业生产合作社里去了，冲破了他们的生产计划和财务计划。据河北省的同志们反映，有许多县份，从上级各部门分配来的这一类的任务不下十几种（包括修公路、装电话、辟运动场、盖俱乐部等等），要有大量的人力财力才能完成，所用人力通通要在农业生产合作社里记入劳动日的账中。也有一些是不算劳动日的，但也要占用很大一部分人的很大一部分时间。
    分配任务的人的用心和积极性自然是很好的，这些事情都是好事情，都是应该做和必须做的，而且都是在全国农业发展纲要草案上规定了的。问题在于：这些好事决不可能一下子办完。全国农业发展纲要是十二年的工作纲领，其中规定了某些事项要在三年、五年、七年之内完成，并没有规定通通要在一年半年之内完成。如果确实能提前完成，自然是太好了。可是，究竟能不能，并不只决定于各个分配任务的部门本身，还决定于国民经济和文化各部门的整体，决定于各部门之间的配合协作，决定于领导机关和人民群众之间的气息相通。
    近几个月，在党中央的领导下，反对保守主义的斗争得到了巨大的成绩。可是，一定要防止并且反对滥用和歪曲这个口号，防止和反对把它变成强迫命令的工具，变成某些个人主义者出风头的手段。在某些地方，“反对保守主义”这个正确的口号已经被某些人滥用起来了。他们没有弄清楚：究竟是先集中主要力量在生产方面，在大大提高了生产水平的基础上改善生活是“保守”呢？还是把人力物力财力分散了浪费了，降低了增加生产的速度是“保守”呢？当然，办社就是为了使大家的日子过得更好，社员群众都愿意把物质生活和文化生活过得更好些；可是，他们十分懂得：没有根的树栽不活，没有根的花开不长；把种籽吃了就不会有丰收，把母鸡杀了就不会有更多的蛋。
    每个农业生产合作社都应该把全国农业发展纲要第二十四条作为自己的经营方针：“一切农业生产合作社都必须实行勤俭办社的原则。勤就是要充分发动社员勤劳生产，扩大生产范围，发展多种经济，进行细致工作。俭就是要厉行节约，降低生产成本，反对铺张浪费。”这才是真正的社会主义气派。
    我国劳动人民从来就以勤俭节约为美德，以奢侈浪费为可耻。这种美德，在转到社会主义的轨道上的时候决不应该中断，而应该大大发扬。我们永远要勤俭。
