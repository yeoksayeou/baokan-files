Chongqing workers are greeting May Day and the National Conference of Advanced Producers with new production achievements.

    Qiu Deming and Yang Youna, bricklayers from the Southwest Fourth Construction Engineering Company, recently created an "automatic rising pole." In April, by using this tool in conjunction with Yang Changshi's "single-person mortar spreader," they laid more than 6,000 bricks per person per day, setting a new record. Workers in the group of young bricklayer Yang Changshi, who is attending the National Conference of Advanced Producers, further improved their "bottomless mortar spreader" in April, significantly improving both the quality and efficiency of bricklaying for columns and brick walls. In the first twenty days of April, the average work efficiency of the entire group exceeded the national unified quota by 78%. They are striving to exceed the national unified quota by 95% and reach the highest level in Sichuan Province as a gift for May Day and the National Conference of Advanced Producers.

    Workers at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company achieved many outstanding production feats in April. Workers at No. 1 blast furnace in the iron smelting workshop actively studied advanced experiences such as the Soviet "furnace top regulation method" and "pressurized air supply." From April 1st to 25th, the quality of the iron produced reached 100%, setting the highest quality record for this furnace since it began smelting. The quality of open-hearth steel in the large steelmaking workshop where Wang Xianjun, a representative attending the National Conference of Advanced Producers, works, averaged over 99%, exceeding the national target. On the 21st, the entire workshop set three new smelting records.

    Since the workers of the roving frame workshop of the No. 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory launched a competition in April to prevent thread breakage for 100 spindles per month, all roving frame workers had exceeded the target by the 24th, and one-third of the workers had achieved a record of over 500 spindles without thread breakage. Yang Suzhen and Liu Wenxiu, workers in the Yan Guangqun model group, set a new record of 1,021 spindles without thread breakage. (Xinhua News Agency)

    重庆职工以新成就迎接全国先进生产者代表会议
    重庆市广大职工正以新的生产成就，迎接“五一”劳动节和全国先进生产者代表会议。
    西南第四建筑工程公司砌砖工丘德明和杨友纳，最近创造了一种“自动升线杆”，四月份他们把这种工具和杨长诗的“单人铺灰器”配合使用，每人每天砌砖六千多块，创造了新纪录。出席全国先进生产者代表会议的青年砌砖工杨长诗所在小组的工人们，四月份进一步改进了他们创造的“无底铺灰器”，使砌砖柱夹砖墙的质量和效率都显著提高。四月份二十天内全组工人的平均工效，已经超过全国统一定额78％。他们正争取超过全国统一定额95％，达到四川省最高水平，来作为对“五一”节和全国先进生产者代表会议的献礼。
    重庆钢铁公司职工四月份创造了许多出色的生产成就。炼铁车间一号高炉的工人们，积极学习苏联“炉顶调剂法”、“压力送风”等先进经验，从四月一日到二十五日，炼出的铁的质量全部达到100％，创造了这个高炉冶炼以来质量最高的纪录。出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表王先俊所在的大型炼钢车间，平炉钢的质量平均达到99％以上，超过了国家指标。在二十一日这天，全车间就创造了三个冶炼新纪录。
    六一零纺织染厂细纱车间落纱工人们四月份开展一个月内落纱一百台不断头的竞赛以来，到二十四日止，全部落纱工人都已经超过指标，并且有三分之一的工人达到了落纱五百台以上不断头。燕光群模范小组的工人杨素珍和刘文秀，更创造了落纱1，021台不断头的最新纪录。（新华社）
