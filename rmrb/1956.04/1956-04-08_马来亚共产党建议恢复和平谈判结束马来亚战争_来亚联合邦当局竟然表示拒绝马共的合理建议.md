Xinhua News Agency, April 7th, Singapore dispatch: Singapore newspapers report that the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Rahman, announced at a press conference in Singapore on April 2nd that he had received a document from the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) suggesting that both sides resume peace talks to end the Malayan War. Rahman revealed the contents of this document at the conference.

The Malayan Communist Party's document stated: The British authorities made some slight concessions in the negotiations regarding the political status of Malaya. This was to promote the continuation of the Malayan War, in order to realize the plot of making Malayans fight Malayans and preventing Malaya from gaining independence.

The document stated that the Malayan Communist Party put forward reasonable proposals at the peace talks held in Baling in December 1955 to reach an agreement to end the war. However, these proposals were not accepted by the Malayan authorities, and the talks failed to reach an agreement. This was entirely due to the sabotage of the British authorities.

The document stated that only if the Malayan authorities grant the people of Malaya, including the Communists, democratic rights and political freedom, and refrain from political insults and personal retaliation against the Malayan Communist Party, can the resumption of negotiations end the Malayan War and restore peace to Malaya.

The document stated that all attempts to force the Malayan Communist Party to surrender will fail completely. The Malayan Communist Party will continue to fight for the restoration of peace in Malaya and for the independence of Malaya.

However, Rahman completely rejected this reasonable proposal from the Malayan Communist Party. He repeated his old tune at the press conference, saying that unless the Malayan Communist Party agrees to surrender unconditionally, he will not reopen negotiations with the Malayan Communist Party.

Rahman said that after the Baling talks ended, some Malayan political parties, organizations, and groups urged the government to reopen negotiations with the Malayan Communist Party to end the Malayan War on reasonable terms. However, he said, "If the government accepts this request, it would be tantamount to saying that the Malayan Communist Party has the sympathy of the Malayan people."

Rahman also said that the military authorities will take "stronger military action" against the Malayan Communist Party. This shows his willingness to continue the war that has long been opposed by the Malayan people.

According to Western news agencies, in the Ulu Kinta area of Perak, government troops began attacking the Malayan National Liberation Army led by the Malayan Communist Party on April 4th. Government troops also implemented "food control" over 40,000 people in eight villages, imposed curfews at the doors of each family, and searched and requisitioned their food reserves. Government troops also imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in another 600-square-mile area near Ipoh.

    马来亚共产党建议恢复和平谈判结束马来亚战争
    来亚联合邦当局竟然表示拒绝马共的合理建议
    新华社7日讯　新加坡消息：据新加坡报纸报道，马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼四月二日在新加坡举行的记者招待会上宣布，他已经收到一份马来亚共产党的文件，这份文件建议双方恢复和平谈判以结束马来亚战争。拉赫曼在会上透露了这份文件的内容。
    马来亚共产党的文件中说：英国当局在关于马来亚政治地位的谈判中作了一些轻微的让步，这是为了促使马来亚战争继续下去，以实现使马来亚人打马来亚人的计谋，阻挡马来亚获得独立。
    文件中说，马来亚共产党在1955年12月在华冷举行的和平谈判中为了要取得结束战争的协议而提出了合理的建议，然而这些建议却没有为马来亚当局所接受，结果谈判未能获得协议。这完全是受到英国当局的破坏。
    文件中说，只有马来亚当局给予马来亚人民包括共产党人以民主权利和政治自由，并且对马来亚共产党人不作政治性侮辱和人身报复，来重新恢复谈判，才有可能结束马来亚的战争，恢复马来亚的和平。
    文件中说，一切企图驱使马来亚共产党投降的计划将全盘失败。马来亚共产党将继续为恢复马来亚的和平和争取马来亚的独立而斗争。
    但是拉赫曼完全拒绝了马来亚共产党这一入情入理的建议，他在记者招待会上重弹老调说，除非马来亚共产党答应无条件投降，否则他将不再同马来亚共产党重开谈判。
    拉赫曼说，在华冷谈判结束以后，有些马来亚的政党组织和团体催促政府同马来亚共产党重开谈判，以合理的条件结束马来亚战争。但是，他说：“政府如果接受这个要求，就等于说马来亚共产党得到马来亚人民的同情。”
    拉赫曼还说，军事当局将对马来亚共产党采取“更强烈的军事行动”。这表明了他愿意继续进行早被马来亚人民所反对的战争。
    据西方通讯社报道，在霹雳州乌鲁近打地区，政府部队在四月四日开始向马来亚共产党领导的马来亚民族解放军进攻。政府部队还对八个乡村的四万人口实行“粮食管制”，在各个家庭的门口实行戒严，搜查和征收了他们的存粮。政府部队还在怡保附近另一个六百平方英里地区实行了从黄昏到黎明的宵禁。
