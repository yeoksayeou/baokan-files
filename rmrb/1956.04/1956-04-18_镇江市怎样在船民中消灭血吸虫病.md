How Zhenjiang City Eliminated Schistosomiasis Among Boat People
Shi Yue'e

Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, is a vital transportation hub on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and in Jiangsu Province. This port has a fixed population of 6,997 boat people, as well as a large number of transient boat people. Boat people "live on the water" and frequently come into contact with river water. Consequently, nearly half of them suffer from schistosomiasis. Furthermore, the feces of boat people with schistosomiasis are directly discharged into the river, and feces containing schistosomiasis are often carried downstream to various counties, seriously affecting the health of the people living along the lower reaches of the river.

To eliminate schistosomiasis among boat people and prevent the spread of the disease, strict management of feces and maintaining clean river water are crucial measures. Starting in 1952, the Zhenjiang City Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Station dispatched a prevention and treatment work team to cooperate with the water police station and the navigation management office. They conducted ideological education among the masses, showed them the cercariae dissected from snails and the miracidia hatched from stool samples, and improved the scientific health knowledge of the boat people. They also established health organizations among the boat people.

After mobilizing the masses, they created many methods for managing feces suitable for the boat people's water-based lifestyle. They manufactured various types of chamber pots according to the different styles and sizes of the ships. The toilets on the ships used to have no bottoms, but now they have been replaced with large chamber pots that can hold seventy catties of feces. Wooden sailboats and fishing boats also purchased chamber pots of various sizes. For fishing boats that were too small to accommodate chamber pots, they used lead wire to hang the chamber pots at the stern of the boat. The manure from livestock on the boats was also collected by a special livestock manure collection team.

To ensure that the boat people's feces were uniformly sealed in pools, toilets and two manure storage pools were built uniformly on the Zhenjiang riverside docks. A professional feces collection team was organized to patrol the waterways in small boats every day to collect feces and wash chamber pots in the water buckets on behalf of the boat people.

Due to the high mobility of the ships, this work was carried out in cooperation with various departments and other ports. All ships departing from Zhenjiang have a fixed system through the shipping company to exchange chamber pots at important wharves in northern Jiangsu, such as Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaiyin, Shaobo, and Jieshou. When ships pass through the above-mentioned wharves, they exchange their full chamber pots for empty ones. Other wooden boats are organized by the health committee members or team leaders on the boats to have farmers collect the feces. Through years of feces management, Zhenjiang boat people have established contact with farmers in northern Jiangsu, and farmers are willing to collect the feces from the boats as fertilizer.

Now, every boat in Zhenjiang Port is equipped with a chamber pot, completely ensuring that feces and fecal containers do not enter the water. At the same time, more than 200 boat people with schistosomiasis have been treated in batches. The work of managing feces and protecting water sources over the years has not only reduced the chance of boat people contracting schistosomiasis, but also gradually reduced the positivity rate of snails. According to a survey conducted in the Niuyutao South Bank management area by the river, the positivity rate of live snails was originally 29%. In 1955, a survey at the same location showed that the positivity rate of live snails had dropped to 0.21%. The nearby areas were also affected by the management area and also dropped to 0.21%. At the same time, after the feces are collected and stored for a certain period, they are good fertilizer for farmers, and the income from the fecal fertilizer has compensated for the expenses of schistosomiasis prevention and treatment and the development of health work.

    镇江市怎样在船民中消灭血吸虫病
    史越峨
    江苏省的镇江市是长江下游和江苏省的水运要道。在这个港口上，有固定的船民6，997人，还有大量的流动船民。船民“以水为生”，经常接触江水，因此，在船民中有近半数的人患有血吸虫病。不仅这样，船民血吸虫病患者的粪便直接排在江水里，带血吸虫的粪便经常向下游各县流传，严重影响沿江下游人民的健康。
    为了消灭船民中的血吸虫病害和防止血吸虫病源的传播，在船民中严格管理粪便，保持江水清洁，是消灭血吸虫病的一个重要措施。从1952年起，镇江市血吸虫病防治站就派了一个防治工作组配合水上派出所和航务管理所，向群众进行思想教育，把解剖了的钉螺体内的尾蚴和大便中孵化出来的毛蚴给群众看，提高船民的科学卫生知识，并在船民中建立了卫生组织。
    群众发动起来之后，他们创造了很多适合船民水上生活习惯的管理粪便的办法。他们根据各种式样和大小的船舶，制造了各种马桶。轮船上过去的厕所都是没底的，现在都改置了可盛七十斤粪便的大马桶。木帆船和渔船也都购置了大小马桶，渔船船身太小，没处安放马桶的，他们就用铅丝把马桶吊在船尾上。船上的猪畜粪便，也专门有个收集畜粪的小组收集畜粪。
    为了使船民的粪便统一进行封池，在镇江沿江码头上统一修建了厕所和二个蓄粪池，并且组织了专业的收粪小组，每天按时摇小船巡回水上收集粪便，并代船民在船上水桶内洗刷马桶。
    船舶流动性很大，这一工作是配合各部门和外埠共同进行的。凡是从镇江出发的轮船，通过轮船公司系统已固定在苏北扬州、高邮、宝应、淮阴、邵伯、界首等重要码头建立了马桶交换制，轮船经过上述码头就将有粪的马桶调换成空马桶。其他木船都由船上的卫生委员或组长负责组织农民收粪。镇江船民经过几年来的粪便管理，已与苏北地区农民建立了联系，农民也愿意收集船上的粪便作为肥料。
    现在，镇江港的每条船都设有马桶，彻底做到粪便粪具不下水，与此同时，分批治疗了船民血吸虫病患者二百多人。几年来进行粪便管理保护水源的工作，不仅使船民减少了感染血吸虫病的机会，而且钉螺中的阳性率也逐步减少。根据在江边鲇鱼套南滩管理区的调查，原来活钉螺中阳性率有29％，1955年在同一地点调查，活钉螺阳性率已下降到0·21％，附近地区因受管理区的影响，也降到0·21％。同时，粪便经收集封存一定时期后，是农民的良好肥料，粪肥的收入还补偿了血吸虫病防治和开展卫生工作方面的经费。
