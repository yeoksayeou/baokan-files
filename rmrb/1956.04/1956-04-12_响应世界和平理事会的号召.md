    The special session of the World Peace Council concluded successfully on April 9th. The meeting adopted important documents on consolidating peace and strengthening international cooperation. These documents express the common aspirations and firm will of the people of all countries in the world to strive for disarmament and further relaxation of international tensions.

    The issue of disarmament was the central issue of this meeting. The representatives of various countries attending the meeting, although holding different views, all expressed their determination and confidence to free mankind from the arms race and the threat of war, and demanded that agreements be reached on disarmament and concrete actions be taken. This is entirely reasonable and should be done. Because, as the World Peace Council stated in its Appeal to World Public Opinion: all mankind throughout the world demands disarmament.

    The issue of disarmament has been delayed for ten years without actual progress. The arms race has continued unabated. This situation not only burdens the people of many countries for a long time with heavy military burdens, preventing them from improving their lives, but also deepens distrust between countries, hindering the resolution of other major international disputes, and increasing the risk of new wars. Especially due to the development of nuclear weapons, the threat of new wars to the people of all countries has increased. Therefore, recently, calls for stopping the arms race and banning nuclear weapons have risen unprecedentedly from all parts of the world. The struggle for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons has acquired a particularly broad character, and various political, social, professional, cultural, and religious groups and individuals have participated. At the same time, thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries and the people of all countries, the international situation has eased, the principle of peaceful coexistence has been accepted by many countries as a norm of international relations, and has been recognized by world public opinion. The significantly increased economic and cultural exchanges between countries with different systems in recent years have proved the benefits of replacing the Cold War and the arms race with the development of peaceful exchanges for the countries concerned and for world peace. Therefore, there are now more favorable conditions for resolving the disarmament issue than at any time in the past. The World Peace Council has fully assessed this situation, and it correctly pointed out: "There are now more and more signs of genuine peace and cooperation among nations. The people of all countries have the ability to turn this hope for the future into reality." The significance of this special session of the World Peace Council lies first and foremost in its powerful expression of this unprecedentedly united and firm will and belief of the people of the whole world.

    The special session of the World Peace Council specifically passed a telegram to the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting in London, demanding that agreements be reached on at least some issues and that several preliminary measures be taken in disarmament. This also reflects the earnest expectations of the people of all countries for the London Disarmament Conference. Everyone believes that reaching an agreement on disarmament and taking practical measures will help strengthen trust between countries and open the way for broad international cooperation. Since the beginning of this Disarmament Subcommittee, it has become the center of concern for the people of all countries. World public opinion has welcomed the new disarmament program proposed by the Soviet Union at the meeting with satisfaction, believing that this program has brought the positions of the major powers closer to a great extent and provided a hopeful basis for breaking the disarmament deadlock. However, people have legitimate doubts about the attitude adopted by the representatives of Western countries: whether they are still trying to keep the discussion of disarmament issues limited to impractical empty talk. The so-called new proposals put forward by Britain, France, and the United States still do not provide effective guarantees for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and in some respects, they have even retreated from previously proposed positions. This fact provides a basis for this doubt. If Western countries insist on their current position and do not change their irreconcilable attitude towards the Soviet proposals, the hope of disarmament will once again be dashed. People fully support the telegram of the special session of the World Peace Council to the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, demanding that the representatives of all countries attending the London meeting must conclude preliminary disarmament agreements on immediately feasible measures, such as immediately stopping nuclear weapons tests and starting to reduce military expenditures, so that the disarmament cause that the people of the world are concerned about can take its first step.

    The World Peace Council, on behalf of the people of all countries, specifically demands that the governments of all countries must reach an effective agreement on the issue of prohibiting all types of nuclear weapons - both strategic and tactical. This is not only because the elimination of nuclear weapons from the arsenals of all countries is a decisive step in eliminating the threat of war, but also because only by stopping the atomic arms race can the peaceful use of atomic energy and international cooperation in this area be fully possible. The World Peace Council does not ignore the difficulties that exist in achieving the reduction and prohibition of nuclear weapons at the present stage. It points out that real progress in disarmament will strengthen international trust, which will help facilitate the realization of the complete prohibition of atomic weapons. The World Peace Council correctly points out that stopping nuclear weapons tests is an immediately feasible measure, because there is no issue of supervision that Western countries are disputing here. However, there are various signs in the attitude of Western countries that make people feel that Western countries are trying to postpone the discussion of destroying existing atomic weapons stockpiles indefinitely, and also intend to legalize the use of atomic weapons. This approach is clearly contrary to the most urgent wishes of the people of all countries. Therefore, people fully agree with the warning of the World Peace Council: "As long as universal disarmament and the complete prohibition of the manufacture and use of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons have not been achieved, the world's public must raise their vigilance and intensify their struggle."

    Facts show that the movement of the people of all countries to defend peace is having an increasingly great impact on the international situation. Even in the countries that are most enthusiastic about war, officials cannot but increasingly take into account the intentions of public opinion when making decisions. Therefore, the World Peace Council's call for peace advocates in all countries to further expand the scale of the peace movement and strengthen the forces of united struggle is of great significance. The World Peace Council points out: The current "main task of the peace movement is to fight for disarmament." It calls on all forces that advocate disarmament to cooperate, and at the same time requires the peace movements in all countries to take active steps to ensure that the national movement for disarmament has a decisive scale and effect. The World Peace Council specifically recommends increasing contacts and exchanges between countries as an effective method. There is no doubt that the call of the World Peace Council will be supported and responded to by peace-loving people all over the world. People are also fully convinced that the approach and common action of all peace forces on the basis of equality and mutual respect will eventually bring trust, disarmament, and international cooperation to the world. The Chinese people will respond to the resolutions of the special session of the World Peace Council with practical actions, and together with the people of all countries, fight with full confidence and unwavering determination to realize these resolutions.

### 响应世界和平理事会的号召

    响应世界和平理事会的号召
    世界和平理事会特别会议已于四月九日圆满闭幕。会议通过了有关巩固和平和加强国际合作的重要文件。这些文件表达了世界各国人民争取裁减军备和进一步缓和国际紧张局势的共同愿望和坚决意志。
    裁军问题是这次会议的中心问题。出席会议的各国代表，尽管观点不尽相同，但是大家都表示了要求使人类摆脱军备竞赛和战争威胁的决心和信心，要求在裁军方面达成协议，采取具体行动。这是完全合理和应当的。因为，如世界和平理事会告世界舆论书所说的：全世界人类都要求裁军。
    裁军问题已经拖延了十年而没有获得实际的进展，军备竞赛迄今有加无已，这种情况不仅使许多国家的人们长久肩负着沉重的军事负担而不能改善他们的生活，而且加深了国与国之间的不信任，妨碍了其他一些重大的国际争端的解决，并增加新战争的危险。特别是由于核子武器的发展，更加增加了新战争对于各国人民的威胁。因此，最近一个时期以来，从世界各处发出来的要求停止军备竞赛和禁止核子武器的呼声空前高涨。争取裁军和禁止原子武器的斗争具有了特别广泛的性质，各种各样的政治、社会、职业、文化和宗教的团体和个人都参加进来了。同时，由于苏联和其他爱好和平国家以及各国人民的共同努力，国际局势已有了缓和，和平共处的原则已被许多国家接受为国际关系的准则，并为世界舆论所公认。近年来有显著增加的在不同制度国家间的经济和文化交往，已经证明以发展和平性质的交流来代替冷战和军备竞赛对于有关国家和世界和平的好处。因此，现在解决裁军问题有了比过去任何时候更为有利的条件。世界和平理事会对于这种情况作了充分的估计，它正确地指出：“现在出现了各国真正和平和合作的越来越多的迹象。各国人民有能力把这种对未来的希望变成现实”。这一次世界和平理事会特别会议的意义，首先就在于它有力地表达了全世界人民这种空前一致和坚决的意志和信念。
    世界和平理事会特别会议专门通过了一封给正在伦敦举行的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的电报，要求至少在某些问题上达成协议，在裁军方面采取几个初步措施。这也是反映了各国人民对伦敦裁军会议的殷切期望。大家相信，在裁军问题上达成协议并且采取实际的措施，就能有助于加强各国之间的信任，打开广泛的国际合作的道路。自从这次裁军小组委员会开始以来，它成为各国人民关怀的中心。世界舆论满意地欢迎苏联在会议上所提出的裁军新方案，认为这个方案使大国的主张有了很大程度的接近，为打开裁军僵局提供了有希望的基础。但是人们对西方国家代表所采取的态度却产生合理的怀疑：究竟他们是否仍然是在努力使裁军问题的讨论停留于不切实际的空谈。英、法和美国所提出的所谓新建议仍然没有就裁军和禁止原子武器提出切实的保证，而且在某些方面还从先前提出过的主张倒退了一步。这个事实为这种怀疑提供了基础。如果西方国家坚持它们目前的主张，不改变它们对苏联建议的不愿调和的态度，就会使得裁军的希望再一次落空。人们完全支持世界和平理事会特别会议致联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的电报，要求出席伦敦会议的各国代表必须至少就诸如立即停止试验核子武器和开始削减军费等马上可行的措施缔结初步的裁军协定，使全世界人民所关心的裁军事业可以迈开它的第一步。
    世界和平理事会代表世界各国人民特别要求各国政府必须就禁止一切类型的核子武器——无分战略的和战术的——的问题达成有效的协议。这不仅是因为从各国军备中取消核子武器是消除战争威胁的一个决定性的步骤，而且因为只有停止原子军备竞赛，才使得原子能的和平利用和这方面的国际合作有充分的可能。世界和平理事会并不忽视在目前阶段实现裁减和禁止核子武器所存在的困难，它指出在裁军方面真正的进展将会加强国际信任，从而有利于促成完全禁止原子武器的实现。世界和平理事会正确地指出，停止核子武器的试验是马上可行的措施，因为这里不存在西方国家所争持的监督的问题。但是在西方国家的态度中有各种迹象使人感到，西方国家正在想把讨论销毁现有原子武器储备的问题无限期推延下去，而且还打算使使用原子武器合法化。这种做法显然是违反各国人民的最迫切的愿望的。所以人们完全同意世界和平理事会的警告：“只要还没有争取到普遍的裁军和完全地禁止制造和使用原子武器和热核子武器，世界的公众就要提高自己的警惕和加紧自己的斗争。”
    事实表明，各国人民保卫和平的运动对于国际局势发生着日益巨大的影响。即使是在最热中于战争的国家里，官方人士在决策的时候也不能不愈来愈多地考虑到舆论的意向。因此，世界和平理事会号召各国的和平拥护者进一步扩大和平运动的规模，加强团结斗争的力量有着重大的意义。世界和平理事会指出：当前“和平运动的主要任务就是为裁军而斗争”，它号召一切主张裁军的力量进行合作，同时要求各国的和平运动采取积极的步骤，来保证争取裁军的全民运动具有决定意义的规模和效果。世界和平理事会特别推荐了增加国家之间接触和来往这个行之有效的方法。毫无疑问，世界和平理事会的号召将会得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持和响应。人们并且充分相信，一切和平力量在平等和互相尊重的基础上的接近和共同行动，终将给世界带来信任、裁军和国际合作。中国人民将以实际行动来响应世界和平理事会特别会议的决议，和各国人民一道，满怀信心和坚定不移地为实现这些决议而斗争。
