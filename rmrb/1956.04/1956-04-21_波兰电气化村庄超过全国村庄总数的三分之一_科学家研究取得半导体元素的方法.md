Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 20th. Since liberation, the number of electrified villages in Poland has reached about 35% of the country's total, compared to only 2.5% before the war.

Polish rural areas are using more and more electricity for production. Last year, farmers owned nearly 50,000 electric motors.

The new Five-Year Plan, which began this year, stipulates that by 1960, electrified villages in Poland will reach about 60% of the country's total. During the five years, about 500,000 farm households will be supplied with electricity.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 20th. Polish scientific circles have recently been paying close attention to studying how to obtain raw materials for manufacturing semiconductor crystal valves. This type of crystal valve can be used to replace radio vacuum tubes and has many advantages, making it very useful in electronic systems.

The Institute of Electronics of the Polish Academy of Sciences has already obtained pure germanium and pure silicon and has begun producing hundreds of crystal valves. Staff at the Warsaw University of Science and Technology have developed a method for producing germanium and gallium on a relatively large scale. This year, the university plans to produce several kilograms of germanium and is also studying methods for large-scale production of germanium and gallium.

    波兰电气化村庄超过全国村庄总数的三分之一
    科学家研究取得半导体元素的方法
    新华社华沙20日电  解放以来，波兰电气化的村庄已经占全国村庄总数的35％左右，而在战前只不过占2.5％。
    波兰农村里已经把越来越多的电力用在生产上。去年，农民拥有的电动机将近五万台。
    今年开始的新五年计划规定，到1960年，波兰电气化的村庄将达到全国村庄总数的60％左右。在五年当中，约将有五十万农户得到电力供应。
    新华社华沙20日电  波兰科学界最近非常注意研究如何取得制造半导体晶体阀的原料。这种晶体阀可以用来代替无线电真空管，而且具有许多优点，在电子学系统中的用途很大。
    波兰科学院电子学研究所已经得到了纯锗和纯矽，并且开始生产数以百计的晶体阀。华沙科学技术学院的工作人员已经研究出比较大规模地生产锗和镓的方法。这个学院今年准备生产几公斤锗，并且还在研究大规模生产锗和镓的方法。
