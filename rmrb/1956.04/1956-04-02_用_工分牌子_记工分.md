    Using "Work Point Tokens" to Record Work Points
    The Feiguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Feixi County, Anhui Province, has adopted the method of using "work point tokens" instead of "labor manuals" to record work points since the spring of this year. This method involves calculating the total number of work points to be spent by the entire cooperative throughout the year based on work quotas and remuneration standards, and producing work point tokens with different denominations. The total number of work point tokens is controlled by the cooperative's accounting office, which distributes the work point tokens to the team's work point recorder according to the work point expenditure plan of each production team. The work point recorder then distributes the work point tokens to each member according to the number of work points they should earn each day. At the same time, the work point recorder records the total number of work points paid out each day in the work ledger, publishes the total payment every five days, and reports it to the accounting office. At the time of distribution, each household of members registers with the accounting office using the work point tokens they have obtained and exchanges them for duplicate receipts.
    Since the Feiguang Cooperative adopted the method of recording work points with "work point tokens," it has simplified the work point recording procedures and saved recording time. At the same time, members no longer suspect that the work point recorder is misreporting their work points, and they are more at ease with production.

    用“工分牌子”记工分
    安徽省肥西县肥光农业生产合作社，从今年春天开始，采用了“工分牌子”代替“劳动手册”记工分的办法。这个办法是根据工作定额和报酬标准计算出全社全年开支的总工分数，制作出分数多少不同的工分牌子。工分牌子的总数由社里会计室掌握，根据各生产队的工分开支计划把工分牌子发给队的记工员，记工员再按每个社员每日应得工分数发给工分牌子。同时，记工员把每日支付的工分总数记在工簿上，每五天公布一次支付总数，并且上报会计室。到分配的时候，每户社员以所得工分牌子到会计室登记，换取联单收据。
    肥光社自从采用“工分牌子”记工的方法以后，简便了记工手续，节省了记工时间。同时，社员再不怀疑记工员给他记错工分，生产更安心了。
