The Liberation Vegetable Garden Production Cooperative in Baotou, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, recently opened an amateur junior middle school cultural class, with thirty-nine members participating in the study. They were originally illiterate, but after participating in literacy classes and people's schools, they have reached the level of primary school graduation. In order to guarantee their study, the Party branch of this cooperative has uniformly arranged meeting and study times for them.
    The Liberation Vegetable Garden Production Cooperative was established under the leadership of model demobilized soldier Qu Zhanquan. Over the past few years, the production and living standards of the members have significantly improved, and the number of households joining the cooperative has reached 582.

    菜园生产合作社办初中文化班
    内蒙古自治区包头市解放菜园生产合作社，最近开办了业余初中文化班，参加学习的有三十九名社员。他们原先一字不识，经过参加识字班和民校的学习后，已达到高小毕业的水平。这个社的党支部为了保证他们的学习，给他们统一安排了开会和学习的时间。
    解放菜园生产合作社是在模范复员军人屈占泉领导下建立的，几年来，社员生产、生活有了显著提高，入社农户已达582户。
