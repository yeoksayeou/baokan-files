    Foreman Leads the Entire Class Forward

    Qiu Guanghe is the shift foreman of Class A in the small rolling mill section of Branch Factory No. 1 of the Tianjin Steel Plant. The Class A he leads completed the state plan evenly every month last year.

    Last year, when this section was trial-producing the new product rebar, it encountered many difficulties. Sometimes, the red-hot steel would shoot out, seriously threatening the safety of the workers. After his painstaking research, improving the roll pass design, and adjusting the axial displacement, he overcame the difficulties and successfully completed the trial production task.

    He not only actively studies technology himself, but also often uses simple examples to teach his knowledge to the workers in his class, so that the technical level of the workers in the class is generally improved. He also frequently visits fraternal factories to introduce experience and help them improve their technology.

    He has also made outstanding achievements in implementing expert suggestions. When implementing the expert's suggestion of "finding the level of the machine," he proposed using lead oil to draw a center mark on the rolling mill, creating conditions for each class to easily find the level, which played a certain role in reducing power consumption and costs for the entire section.

    Because of these advantages, he has won the title of Tianjin Municipal Labor Model from 1953 to 1955. Recently, he also attended the Advanced Producer Representative Conference of the Ministry of Heavy Industry.

    带动全班前进的工长
    丘光河是天津钢厂一分厂小型轧钢工段甲班值班工长。他所领导的甲班去年月月均衡地完成了国家计划。
    去年，这个工段试制新产品螺纹钢的时候，遇到很多困难，有时候通红的钢材窜出来，严重地威胁工人的安全。经他刻苦钻研，改进轧辊孔型，调整轴量以后，才战胜了困难，顺利完成了试制任务。
    他不仅自己积极钻研技术，还经常用通俗的实例把自己的知识教给本班工人，使班内工人技术水平普遍提高。他也经常去各兄弟厂介绍经验和帮助他们改进技术。
    在执行专家建议方面，他也做出了很出色的成绩。执行专家“车找平”建议的时候，他提出用铅油在轧钢机上画一中心标志，为各班便于找平创造了条件，对全工段降低电耗、降低成本上起了一定作用。
    正因为他有这些优点，从1953年到1955年他都获得了天津市劳动模范的荣誉。最近，他又出席了重工业部先进生产者代表大会。
