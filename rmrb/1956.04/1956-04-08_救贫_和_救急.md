    “Saving the Poor” and “Meeting Emergency Needs”
    Zhang Xing
    Providing appropriate subsidies to employees with financial difficulties is a concrete manifestation of the Party, the government, and the trade union's concern for the masses. Doing a good job in providing financial assistance can alleviate the financial difficulties of employees, thereby increasing their enthusiasm for production.
    However, at present, some trade union workers hold an extremely harmful idea of "meeting emergency needs but not saving the poor" regarding the work of providing financial assistance. They believe that: "The funds for financial assistance are limited, and 'poverty' is unlimited, so only by 'not saving the poor' can the scope of assistance be controlled"; "Since the factory has already paid wages according to your labor and technical level, wouldn't it violate the principle of distribution according to work if you are given regular subsidies?"
    Under these circumstances, some people who are truly in financial difficulty do not receive subsidies, while people who are not in financial difficulty often receive subsidies under the pretext of "urgent needs." Some people even use this money to buy leather shoes, radios, and so on. This violates the purpose of providing financial assistance to those with difficulties.
    The correct approach should be to conduct research and investigation into the lives of employees, understand who has difficulties, who has the most difficulties, and realistically determine the targets for regular subsidies and seasonal subsidies, and provide them with regular or seasonal subsidies. Temporary difficulties caused by illness, children entering school, unexpected disasters, etc., should also be given appropriate temporary subsidies based on the economic conditions of the employees.
    Perhaps some people will ask: "What if there is no money?" The fact is: most enterprises have a surplus of the various appropriations from the state for employee welfare, and some units also have a large surplus of funds for financial assistance. So the problem is not a lack of money, but whether we are willing to use our brains and find ways to give full play to the role of the various appropriations from the state for employee welfare; whether we are willing to share weal and woe with the masses and realistically solve the masses' problems of financial difficulty.

    “救贫”和“救急”
    张星
    对生活有困难的职工给以适当的补助，这是党、政府和工会关怀群众的具体表现。生活困难的补助工作做好了，可以使职工生活上的困难得到减轻，从而提高职工的生产积极性。
    但是，目前在某些工会工作人员中，对生活困难补助工作抱着一种极为有害的“救急不救贫”的思想。他们认为：“困难补助费是有限的，“贫”是无限的，只有“不救贫”才能控制补助的范围”；“既然工厂已经按照你的劳动和技术等级付给了工资，如果再给以经常补助，岂不违反了按劳付酬的原则？”
    在这种情况下，一些生活真正困难的人得不到补助，生活并不困难的人却往往在“急需”的借口下得到了补助。有些人甚至拿这笔钱去买皮鞋、收音机等。这是违反生活困难补助的目的的。
    正确的做法应该是经过对职工生活的调查研究，了解谁有困难，谁最困难，实事求是，确定经常补助和季节性补助的对象，对他们进行经常的或季节性的补助。对因疾病、子女入学、意外灾害等原因所造成的临时性的困难，也应该根据职工的经济条件，给以适当的临时性的补助。
    也许有人会问：“没有钱怎么办”？事实是：国家对职工生活福利的各项拨款，企业里一般都有结余，有的单位困难补助费也有大量结余。所以问题不是没有钱，而是我们肯不肯开动脑筋、想办法，让国家对职工生活福利的各项拨款充分发挥它的作用；我们愿不愿跟群众同呼吸、共甘苦，实事求是地解决群众的生活困难问题。
