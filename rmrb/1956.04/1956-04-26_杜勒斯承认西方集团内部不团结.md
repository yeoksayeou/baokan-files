Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 24th: In a speech delivered at the Associated Press annual meeting on April 23rd, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles addressed the issue of “disunity” within the Western bloc. He stated: “The historical weakness of the West has been its disunity.”

Dulles said that the world is at a moment when a succession of rapidly occurring important events are changing the face of Europe, the Near East, and Asia. He said that the "sense of fear" that enveloped the Western world "no longer exists." Allies no longer feel that they “must eliminate differences,” and neutralism is considered a safe and advantageous policy.

Apparently in an attempt to recreate this artificial "sense of fear," Dulles devoted a large portion of his speech to slandering the Soviet Union, continuing to use the so-called "communist threat" to frighten people.

However, Dulles admitted: "We cannot restore what has already happened in the world to its original state." He believes that this new situation makes the United States' diplomatic work "more difficult" and contains "risks" of the United States suffering some kind of defeat.

Dulles advocated that the West should continue to pursue a policy of "strength" and organize military blocs. He called for strengthening "unity" within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

He spoke of considering the "greater role" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for the sake of "unity." He said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "was initially established as a military alliance, and this aspect of the organization remains very important," but Canada, France, and Italy advocate that the organization should have "a greater role." He said that this issue would be further discussed at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Paris next week.

    杜勒斯承认西方集团内部不团结
    新华社24日电  纽约消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯四月二十三日在美联社年会上发表的演说里，谈到西方集团内部“不团结”的问题。他说：“西方的历史性弱点就是它的不团结。”
    杜勒斯说，世界正处在一个接连不断迅速发生的重要事件改变着欧洲、近东和亚洲的面貌的时刻。他说，笼罩着西方世界的“恐惧情绪已经不再存在”。盟国不再感到”“必须消除分歧了”，中立主义被认为是一个安全的、有利的方针。
    显然是为了重新制造这种人为的“恐惧情绪”，杜勒斯在演说里又用了大量的篇幅来诽谤苏联，继续用所谓“共产主义威胁”来吓唬人。
    但是，杜勒斯承认：“我们不能使世界上已经发生的事情恢复原状”。他认为，这种新的局势使美国的外交工作“更加困难”，并且包含有使美国遭受某种失败的“风险”。
    杜勒斯鼓吹西方要继续执行“实力地位”和组织军事集团的政策。他呼吁北大西洋集团内部要加强“团结”。
    他谈到为了“团结”，要考虑北大西洋集团“有更多作用”的问题。他说，北大西洋集团“首先是作为一个军事联盟而成立的，而且这个组织的这一方面依然是非常重要的”，但是，加拿大、法国和意大利都主张这个组织“有更多的作用”。他说，下星期在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议上会进一步讨论这个问题。
