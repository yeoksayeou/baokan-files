Recently, an organization calling itself the "International Committee Against Concentration Camp Systems" and the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" have set up a so-called "special tribunal" to "investigate" and "interrogate" the fabricated issue of China's "forced labor system."

What exactly is going on? As early as May 26, 1955, the "International Committee Against Concentration Camp Systems" advertised in the "Hong Kong Times," run by the Chiang gang, through the Chiang gang's "Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Federation," offering to buy any "accusations" against our country. This advertisement was placed after the "International Committee Against Concentration Camp Systems" Vice Chairman Rosset and his ilk visited Taiwan and Hong Kong twice. They collected "valuable materials" from the Chiang gang government, the Taiwan Trade Union, and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Federation and other Chiang gang organizations. They also collected the slanders of some spies who were legally sentenced and deported from our country. Thus, everyone can see that this ugly farce staged by these two so-called international organizations is nothing more than a reprint of the slanders of the American and Chiang reactionary clique against the Chinese people.

In fact, the "International Committee Against Concentration Camp Systems" had long been clamoring to organize a "court" in Asia to "publicly try" our country. However, this kind of dirty trick has become so notorious that it is not only unacceptable to the people of all countries, but also disdained by the governments of many countries. Therefore, these two organizations had to announce that they would conduct so-called "secret interrogations" at their headquarters in Brussels.

This trick is part of the United States' campaign of rumor-mongering and slander against socialist countries. The "International Committee Against Concentration Camp Systems" was established in 1950 specifically for this purpose. As for the fact that some leaders of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" also take the creation and dissemination of such slanders as their main task, this is well known. People remember that these two organizations have constantly cooperated closely with the United States and Chiang Kai-shek to accuse our country and other socialist countries of so-called "forced labor" to the United Nations Economic and Social Council and the International Labour Organization. What is particularly special this time is that they have even set up a so-called "special tribunal" to conduct so-called "interrogations," but they have forgotten that no matter how new the tricks are, ugly deeds are still ugly deeds.

These rumor-mongers, like Hitler and Goebbels, believe that repeating lies many times can turn them into truth. Little do they know that their adoption of such utterly boring methods to slander China can only prove China's strength and its influence is increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

    穷极无聊

    最近有一个自称为“反集中营制度国际委员会”的组织和“国际自由工会联合会”，设立了一个所谓“特别法庭”来“调查”和“审问”捏造的中国“强迫劳动制度”问题。
    这究竟是怎么一回事呢？原来早在1955年5月26日“反集中营制度国际委员会”通过蒋帮的“港九工会联合会”在蒋帮所办的“香港时报”上就登了启事，出钱收买任何对我国的“控告书”。这个启事是在“反集中营制度国际委员会”副主席罗赛特之流两次访问台湾和香港以后登出的。他们向蒋帮政府、台湾工会和港九工会联合会等蒋帮组织搜集了“宝贵材料”。他们还收罗了被我国依法判决驱逐出境的一些间谍的诽谤。这样，大家可以看到，这两个所谓国际组织演出的这出丑剧不过是美蒋反动集团对中国人民的诬蔑的再版而已。
    事实上，“反集中营制度国际委员会”早就叫嚷要在亚洲组织“法庭”“公开审判”我国。但是，这种勾当已经如此臭名远扬，以至它不但为各国人民所不能允许，而且也为许多国家的政府所不齿。因此，这两个组织只得宣布在自己的布鲁塞尔总部来进行所谓“秘密审问”。
    这种把戏是美国对各社会主义国家所进行造谣诽谤的一部分。“反集中营制度国际委员会”也就是专门为了这个目的在1950年设立的。至于“国际自由工会联合会”的某些领导人也以制造和散布这种诬蔑作为他们的主要任务，则是众所周知的。人们记得这两个组织曾不断地密切配合美蒋向联合国经济及社会理事会和国际劳工组织诬控我国和各社会主义国家进行所谓“强迫劳动”。这一次有些特别的是他们竟然设立了所谓“特别法庭”来进行所谓“审问”了，但是他们忘记了不管花样如何翻新，丑恶的勾当终久是丑恶的勾当。
    这些造谣者像希特勒和戈培尔一样，以为多次重复谎言就能使它变成真理。殊不知，他们采取这样穷极无聊的办法来诬蔑中国，只能反证中国的强大和它的影响日益深入人心。
