    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker," representatives of twenty American organizations recently held a meeting under the auspices of the National Committee to Protect the Foreign Born to discuss the issue of defending the rights of foreign-born individuals in the United States. The meeting decided to send a delegation to visit members of Congress, demanding amendments to the McCarran-Walter Act, which is specifically used to persecute foreign-born individuals and progressives. The meeting also decided to write an open letter to Eisenhower, requesting that he propose recommendations for amending this law. Furthermore, the meeting resolved to launch a movement against the American authorities' unreasonable revocation of American citizenship from some foreign-born individuals.
    The National Committee to Protect the Foreign Born is an organization with more than 20 years of history. For many years, it has been fighting to defend the rights of the more than ten million foreign-born individuals in the United States and to oppose the McCarran-Walter Act. The McCarran-Walter Act began to be implemented at the end of 1952. In the first two years of implementing this fascist decree, approximately 1.5 million people in the United States were accused of violating this law and deported to Mexico, becoming the largest mass deportation in American history. In 1955, more than 10,000 Americans of foreign descent were also deported, including union leaders who fought against the Taft-Hartley Act, pro-peace newspaper editors, and other progressive leaders.

    反对麦卡伦—华尔特法的集会
    据新华社讯  据纽约“工人日报”报道，在美国全国保护外国出生者委员会的主持下，美国二十个组织的代表最近举行了一次会议，讨论保卫在美国的外国出生者的权利的问题。会议决定派出代表团访问国会议员，要求修改专门用来迫害外国出生者以及进步人士的麦卡伦—华尔特法。会议并且决定写一封公开信给艾森豪威尔，要求他提出关于修改这个法令的建议。会议还决定发动一个运动，反对美国当局无理取消一些外国出生者的美国公民籍。
    美国全国保护外国出生者委员会是一个有着二十多年历史的组织，它多年来一直是为保卫在美国的一千多万外国出生者的权利以及反对麦卡伦—华尔特法而斗争。麦卡伦—华尔特法是在1952年年底开始实施的。在实施这个法西斯法令的头两年中，美国国内就有约一百五十万人被控违反这个法令而被驱逐到墨西哥去，成为美国历史上规模最大的集体驱逐出境。在1955年，也有一万多名外国血统的美国人被驱逐出境，其中有同塔夫脱—哈特莱法进行斗争的工会领袖、拥护和平的报纸编辑以及其他进步领袖。
