The August First Agricultural College in Xinjiang has achieved significant development in the three years since its establishment. The college currently has five departments, including Agronomy, Forestry, Water Conservancy, Agricultural Economics, and Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, as well as an Agricultural Machinery Class. It includes five undergraduate (four-year) classes in Agronomy, Veterinary Medicine, Water Conservancy, and Afforestation, and twenty-one specialized (two-year) classes in Agronomy, Horticulture, Afforestation, Animal Husbandry, Finance, Agricultural Economics, Water Conservancy, and Agricultural Machinery. The current student population has increased by 44.9% compared to the 1952-1953 academic year, and it has over 11,000 mu of cultivated land for teaching practice and production internships.

The integration of theory with practice is the teaching policy of the August First Agricultural College. According to the teaching plan, during each production season, students from various departments go to various military farms for production internships. Through production internships, students have the opportunity to comprehensively apply what they have learned to production practice, so that the theories they have learned are verified and consolidated. Through the students' production internships, the August First Agricultural College has provided significant practical assistance to military agricultural production in Xinjiang. In 1954, during their production internship, students majoring in cotton and grain in the Agronomy Department were responsible for guiding the planting of high-yield crops such as cotton, rice, corn, and winter wheat on 56,335.58 mu for military farms, resulting in an average yield of 375.6 jin per mu for 34,970 mu of winter wheat, with 9,658.39 mu averaging 414.87 jin per mu. In 1954, students interning at a military farm, under the guidance of teachers, killed 31,114,988 cotton bollworms by making syrup and other methods, greatly reducing the harm caused by cotton bollworms. In 1955, Zhu Guangxi, an agricultural student interning at a military farm, created an eight-nozzle, horse-drawn sprayer from a single-nozzle sprayer, saving the military farm thirteen to fourteen laborers per day and increasing work efficiency by 1.5 to 2 times, solving the current difficulties in plant protection work in large-area cotton fields. This creation was praised and promoted by the farm leadership. At the same time, while students are conducting production internships, the August First Agricultural College also sends teachers to guide the agricultural production of the troops. In 1955, the area of high-yield crops guided by the teachers of the Agronomy Department in various farms reached 363,500 mu. The Agricultural Economics Department invested all its teachers to assist a military farm in establishing a production and financial system. Based on the actual needs of the Ziniquan Sheep Breeding Farm, the faculty and students of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department assisted a military farm in formulating a production plan for 1954-1955, increasing the farm's breeding rate of stud sheep from 129% in 1954 to 142% in 1955. The record of the production troops in the Manas River basin obtaining an average yield of 402 jin per mu on 20,000 mu of cotton fields in 1953 was also inseparable from the assistance and guidance of the faculty and students of the Agricultural College. Because teachers actively participate in guiding actual production, their scientific theories are constantly enriched with novel materials from practice, thereby enriching teaching content and improving teaching effectiveness. For example, teachers in the insect pest teaching and research group of the Agronomy Department identified more than 60 kinds of insect pests of cotton, grain, horticulture and other crops through guiding actual production and incorporated them into teaching materials.

The August First Agricultural College also pays attention to helping local agricultural production. In 1954, under the guidance and assistance of the faculty and students of the Agricultural College, the 36,300 mu of cotton fields of farmers in Turpan County achieved a yield of 331.15 jin per mu. This was an unprecedented high yield in Turpan County. In the same year, the Agricultural College organized an expert working group, under the guidance of Soviet experts, to teach crop high-yield technologies to farmers of all ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang. About 15,000 farmers and cadres at all levels in the four special districts of southern Xinjiang heard the technical guidance reports. Various agricultural technical measures proposed by the Agricultural College in southern Xinjiang, such as expanding the planting area of ​​winter wheat, reducing the planting area of ​​spring wheat, adopting autumn-winter irrigation, changing flood irrigation to furrow irrigation, increasing cotton plant density, and adopting cotton pruning, have all been implemented among the masses. In 1955, thirty-two faculty and students of the Veterinary Medicine Department of the Agricultural College supported the prevention and control of livestock foot-and-mouth disease in the Yili area, cooperating with local technical cadres to implement measures such as blockade, isolation, treatment, disinfection, and vaccination. After three months of hard work, foot-and-mouth disease was eradicated in five counties and one city in the Yili area, and the spread of foot-and-mouth disease was stopped. According to incomplete statistics, more than 250,000 head of cloven-hoofed domestic animals such as cattle and sheep were cured.

In the past three years, the August First Agricultural College has trained more than 1,790 agricultural technical and management cadres for the country, including cadres from fraternal ethnic groups such as Uygur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Hui, Manchu, Xibe, Tibetan, Miao, and Yi. The vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives, technology promotion stations, and state-owned farms and ranches in Xinjiang have graduates from the August First Agricultural College serving in management and technical guidance positions.

The development and achievements of the August First Agricultural College are inseparable from the internationalist and selfless assistance of Soviet agricultural expert Comrade Titov and agricultural machinery expert Comrade Khvileya. Titov and Khvileya respectively served as lecturers in cotton cultivation and agricultural machinery courses at the college, and wrote millions of words of lecture notes on cotton cultivation and tractor science, teaching the advanced Soviet experience to the faculty and students of the Agricultural College. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the Agricultural College also revised the teaching plans for specialized courses in agronomy, water conservancy, forestry, animal husbandry, and agricultural economics, changing the previous phenomenon of students' excessive study burden. Titov personally went to various farms for demonstration guidance during each student's production internship. At his suggestion, the production internship of the agronomy department's specialized students adopted the method of each person being responsible for the technical guidance of 200 mu of high-yield crops, which achieved great results in students' integration of theory with practice and enrichment of practical knowledge.

With the advent of the high tide of the national agricultural cooperativization movement, the August First Agricultural College in Xinjiang will shoulder more arduous tasks in my country's agricultural socialist transformation. It is estimated that during my country's second five-year plan period, the total number of students at the August First Agricultural College will be 1.5 times that of 1955, of which undergraduate (four-year) students will increase to 11.1 times the current number of undergraduate students.

    培养新疆建设人材的八一农学院
    刘天梧
    新疆八一农学院从成立到现在，三年来获得了很大的发展。这个学院现有农学、林学、水利、农业经济、畜牧兽医等五个系和农业机械班，包括农学、兽医、水利、造林等本科（四年制）五个班和农学、园艺、造林、畜牧、财务、农业经济、水利、农业机械等专修科（二年制）二十一个班，现有学生人数较1952—1953学年度增加了44.9％，并有供教学实习及生产实习用的耕地一万一千多亩。
    理论结合实际是八一农学院的教学方针，按照教学计划，每当生产季节，各系学生都纷纷到各部队农场进行生产实习。通过生产实习，使学生有机会将所学各科综合的运用于生产实践，使所学的理论得到印证和巩固。通过学生的生产实习，八一农学院对新疆的部队农业生产有很大的实际帮助。1954年农学系棉、粮专修科学生在生产实习期间，为部队农场负责指导种植棉花、水稻、玉米、冬小麦等丰产作物56，335.58亩，使34，970亩冬小麦每亩平均产量达375.6市斤，其中9，658.39亩每亩平均产量达414.87市斤。1954年在某部农场实习的学生，在教师指导下用制作糖浆等方法捕杀了棉铃虫31，114，988条，大大减轻了棉铃虫的危害。1955年在某部农场实习的农业专修科学生朱光熹，创造用单管喷雾器装制成八管马拉喷雾机，为部队农场每日节省十三至十四个劳力，并提高工作效率一倍半到两倍，解决了目前大面积棉田植物保护工作中的困难。这一创造获得农场领导的赞扬和推广。同时，在学生进行生产实习的时候，八一农学院并派出教师指导部队的农业生产。1955年农学系教师在各农场负责指导的作物丰产面积即达363，500亩。农业经济系为协助某部农场建立生产财务制度，全体教师都投入这项工作。根据紫泥泉种羊场的实际需要，畜牧兽医系师生协助某部农场制订1954—1955年度的生产计划，使农场由1954年种羊繁殖率的129％提高到1955年的142％。1953年玛纳斯河流域的生产部队在两万亩棉田面积上获得平均每亩产402斤的丰产纪录，也是和农学院师生的协助指导分不开的。由于教师们积极参加指导实际生产，使教师们的科学理论不断从实践中得到新颖材料的充实，从而丰富了教学内容，提高了教学效果。如农学系虫害教研组教师通过指导实际生产鉴定出棉花、粮食、园艺等作物害虫六十多种编入教材。
    八一农学院同时注意到对地方农业生产的帮助。1954年在农学院师生的指导帮助下，使吐鲁番县农民的36，300亩棉田获得每亩331.15斤的产量。这是吐鲁番县从未有过的丰产。同年，农学院又组织专家工作组，在苏联专家的指导下，到南疆向各族农民进行作物丰产技术的传授。南疆四个专区的农民和各级干部听到技术指导报告的约有一万五千人。农学院在南疆提出的各项农业技术措施，如扩大冬小麦播种面积，缩小春小麦播种面积，采用秋—冬灌溉，改漫灌为沟灌，增大棉株密度，采用棉花整枝等，都在群众中得到贯彻。1955年农学院兽医本科师生三十二人支援伊犁区牲畜口蹄疫防治工作，配合当地技术干部，实行封锁、隔离、治疗、消毒和接种等措施，经三个月的艰苦工作，扑灭了伊犁区五县一市的口蹄疫，并且制止了口蹄疫向外发展，据不完全统计，治愈了牛羊等偶蹄家畜二十五万头以上。
      三年来，八一农学院为国家培养了1，790多名农业技术和经营管理干部，其中并包括有维吾尔、哈萨克、乌孜别克、回、满、锡伯、藏、苗、彝等兄弟民族干部。新疆各地绝大多数的农业生产合作社，技术推广站和国营农、牧场都有八一农学院的毕业学生担任经营管理和技术指导工作。
    八一农学院的发展和它取得的成就，是与苏联农学专家提托夫同志和农业机械专家赫维利亚同志的国际主义的无私帮助分不开的。提托夫和赫维利亚分别担任该院棉作栽培学和农业机械学课程的讲授，编写有数百万言的棉作栽培学和拖拉机学讲义，将苏联先进经验教给农学院师生。农学院并在苏联专家的指导下，将农学、水利、森林、畜牧、农业经济等专修科的教学计划作了修改，改变了过去学生学习负担过重的现象。提托夫在学生每次生产实习的时候，还亲自到各农场进行示范指导。在他的倡议下，农学系专修科学生生产实习采用每人负责二百亩丰产作物的技术指导的方法，使学生在理论结合实际和丰富实践知识方面取得了很大效果。
    随着全国农业合作化运动高潮的到来，新疆八一农学院在我国农业社会主义改造事业中将肩负更艰巨的任务，预计在我国第二个五年计划的时期，八一农学院学生总数将是1955年的一倍半，其中本科（四年制）学生将增长为目前本科学生数的十一点一倍。
