Speech at the Tenth Anniversary Celebration of the World Federation of Scientific Workers
The Social Responsibility of Scientists
Professor Powell, Vice President of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, Chairman of the Executive Council of the World Federation of Scientific Workers

I. The Significance of Our Time

It is beginning to dawn on us, though this recognition needs further in-depth exploration and mastery, that because we live in this great and decisive era of human history, we have our own responsibilities to bear and many good opportunities. No one in any previous era has encountered such a sharply contradictory situation. In our time, the following question will be decided: Will humanity's long and arduous development from primitive uncivilization, through barbarism to civilization, lead to a bright and splendid future? Or will it suffer a devastating blow in a war using atomic weapons, leaving the surviving, ravaged humanity to start life anew in a strange world? In such a world, even the surviving flora and fauna on Earth would be peculiar and fragmented.

These current dangers and opportunities are the result of a great scientific discovery—the harnessing of atomic energy—which is the culmination of fifty years of research. This tremendous development of our capabilities is not accidental. It is the inevitable result of conscious inquiry into how to acquire knowledge about and control nature, a method of inquiry that is relatively new in human history. The development of this new method—the scientific method—is the great and prominent feature of our time.

In the past, there have been many great discoveries and technological innovations that have brought about tremendous changes in human society. But before civilization was established about five thousand years ago, such discoveries and innovations were very rare. The discovery of fire and the method of using it was one such innovation. We do not know when this was first discovered; some authorities say it was 100,000 years ago. The ability to use fire must have been extremely important to early societies. With fire, it was possible to cook certain foods that could not be eaten uncooked, thus increasing the food supply for the earliest settlers. As time went on, people could smelt metals, which led to new tools, and the application of these new tools brought about changes in many areas.

In a narrow sense, the entire history of humanity can be seen as a result of the discovery of "fire," and the great significance of this discovery has long been recognized and commemorated in many primitive and ethnic legends. The great discoveries that concern us today, and their consequences, which can only be dimly seen at present, are derived from the inventions of the past; but their significance for human life far surpasses anything that has gone before.

In uncivilized times, the slow pace of technological progress is illustrated by the fact that it took tens of thousands of years after the discovery of "fire" to use it to smelt iron: it was only five thousand years ago that iron and iron tools were first used. However, as humans increasingly lived in larger and relatively more settled societies, the types of arts and crafts greatly increased! Accumulated technology and experience were also passed down from generation to generation.

Despite these characteristics of civilization, the pace of progress was still quite slow compared to our modern society. Most of the innovations at that time occurred by chance observation and accidental circumstances, rather than as a result of in-depth exploration of the nature of things. But soon after, a tremendous change occurred.

In the mid-fifteenth century, a period of ardent practical, intellectual, and artistic creativity began in Western Europe—especially in Italy—the period commonly known as the Renaissance. Humans, who had been bound by narrow religious dogmas for centuries, broke free! In the new spirit of freedom, they began to have confidence in their own abilities. A new spirit emerged, gradually convincing people that relying solely on ancient authorities like Aristotle was not enough to solve the problems they encountered. To increase knowledge, people had to conduct research themselves.

Leonardo da Vinci said: "They will say that since I am not a scholar, I will not be able to properly express what I want to describe. But they do not know that the issues related to me will certainly be understood, but not through the words of others, but through experiments. Experiment has always been the lover of those with good writing skills, so, in all cases, I quote her name."

Da Vinci also said: "Many people will believe that I will be condemned, because my experiments contradict the authority of some people, and the arguments of these people are respected, although these arguments are not based on experience, but it should be considered that my conclusions are derived from simple and unadorned experience, that is, from the true lover."

In the hundred years that followed, this new spirit of exploration gradually developed, and was supported by powerful new allies, such as Bacon in England and Descartes in France. These people were not only deeply convinced of the correct methods necessary to promote the new spirit of exploration, but also had profound confidence in the purpose of this exploration itself. They believed that nature must be studied through experiments, and that the purpose of this exploration was to enrich human life with new inventions and wealth. Bacon's philosophy expressed a deep love for humanity; a love so profound that even the wisest would not undervalue all things, and this valuation could bring joy to the most humble and also bring pain. For him, the new scientific method should help people's practical needs, and should not be disrupted by the illusions of sophistry. In this regard, he did express disdain for illusions and theories, which we now know are all shots in the dark.

In the fifty years after Bacon's work, his views were strongly supported in many European countries, and many academic groups were established to give practical effect to this new spirit of exploration. Although major achievements such as Newton's discovery of the law of universal gravitation had been made, it was during the "Industrial Revolution" that this experimental, critical new method showed its important advantages. The "Industrial Revolution," in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, transformed Britain from an agricultural country into a huge factory.

Since the mid-nineteenth century, we have seen more and more clearly that the scientific method is being applied more and more widely in human affairs. However, this is far from being fully developed. This method of seeking new knowledge is far more effective than any method in the past, which has led to technological innovations appearing one after another more and more rapidly, and continuously. In the lifetime of many of us here, we have seen many things, to name just a few: electrons and X-rays, wireless telegraphy and wireless fax, internal combustion engines and gas turbines, automobiles and airplanes, radioactivity, atomic energy, and the hydrogen bomb. In ancient times, any one of these discoveries would have been the hallmark of a century.

It is extremely important that we clearly recognize that we have entered a time of great change in human history, a time that some call the Second Industrial Revolution. This naming reduces and obscures the importance of this era. Professor Bernal has pointed out that the changes now taking place are far greater in scale than the Industrial Revolution; although these changes are expressed in industry, more precisely, its main spirit is in science, rather than technology. One might even call it a scientific revolution, because science is not only used to change industry, but it is actually guiding this change. He said: "The industry of the future can be imagined, planned, and conducted from a scientific point of view to a degree that we cannot imagine now."

The characteristic of this new era is endless technological innovation, and the many good opportunities and complex situations that result. We must not let the development of the hydrogen bomb mark the end of this era, but let it mark the beginning of an era. If we want to predict the direction of future developments, we must take into account the possibility of new discoveries and innovations. The discovery of atomic fission in 1939 and the explosion of the first atomic bomb in 1945 were only six years apart, and less than ten years later, the hydrogen bomb, which is more than a thousand times more powerful than the atomic bomb, was invented.

The difficult situation of our time is that in this world where people make many radical political decisions, the discovery of atomic energy requires us to make the following choice: either the major powers reach a reconciliation to jointly seek ways to coexist; or a war is waged with nuclear weapons. If political differences are resolved peacefully, then we have reason to predict that tensions will ease, armaments will be reduced, and the scientific and creative forces thus liberated will be quickly and effectively applied to the pressing problem of raising the living standards of people around the world. There is no doubt that once this way of solving problems is found, then the future of humanity will quickly change its face: in the next fifty years, the dangers, pain, and anxiety we are currently suffering will be viewed sympathetically as the consequences of human folly in a pre-scientific era. On the other hand, if a war with atomic and thermonuclear weapons breaks out between the major powers, then without a doubt, a large part of the Earth's population and most of the achievements gained during the period of human civilization will eventually be destroyed. In the current frantic nuclear weapons arms race, many authorities do feel that the effects of these periodic explosion tests are sufficient to cause serious harm to all of humanity.

This situation gives scientists of all professions around the world a serious responsibility. This great new power, whether good or bad, has been discovered through science and scientists. Because this tremendous destructive power is the first batch of products produced by this new discovery, it is no wonder that good people around the world sometimes look at science with suspicion.

II. The Moral Prestige of Science and Scientists

About ten years ago, shortly after the establishment of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, Professor Joliot-Curie wrote in the introduction to his published booklet: "In this generation before, no one seriously doubted that science, as the highest quality symbol of the human spirit, is one of the most abundant sources of material and spiritual benefits. True, the course of disseminating scientific knowledge among the people has encountered strong resistance from those who are immersed in mysticism and superstition, as well as those who maintain their interests and privileges by relying on the weakness and ignorance of the common people under their rule. Due to the early abuse of achievements in science, many difficulties and injustices have been caused, but people's confidence in science has been steadily rising.

What has happened in the past fifty years has significantly changed this general attitude. Since the end of the last century, some of the bad consequences produced by science have caused people to feel increasingly worried and distressed. Some people even doubt the value of science as one of the elements of civilization. The recent atomic bomb incident has further increased the ideological confusion of the scientists themselves, as well as the confusion in people's attitudes towards science."

This suspicious, sometimes even hostile, attitude of people towards science, even if it exists only in a small number of countries, must be regarded by scientists as a very serious matter. For hundreds of years, the important factor that guaranteed the prosperity and growth of science has been the lofty prestige that scientists enjoy in terms of morality. Everyone knows that in these hundreds of years, they have wholeheartedly dedicated themselves to the great goal of human progress; in these hundreds of years, to quote Professor Joliot-Curie again, there is no doubt that, "Scientific knowledge has banished superstition and people's fear of invisible forces, bringing peace to our minds and firm confidence in human progress, and at the same time making us more clearly aware of our position in the universe."

Without moral prestige and public support, it is impossible for science to undertake this great task of decisive significance that the current situation may bestow upon it. Our current situation requires everyone to make the widest possible use of the scientific method in all aspects of human affairs. Our current situation requires us to increase the number of scientists in every country many times over, while providing them with all the technical conditions necessary for their work. Without broad public support, a country's scientific potential cannot be quickly developed, or even delayed. Scientists' work will not only suffer from the lack of suitable tools for experimentation, but also from the lack of external encouragement, which comes from the public's concern and respect for their work.

In order for science to enjoy the public support it has long enjoyed—at least in some countries there is a danger of losing this support—scientists must use their actions to show that they are very concerned about the major problems facing humanity today. To show, if necessary, that they are prepared to make personal sacrifices to ensure that science is not misused for destructive purposes, but is widely used to improve human happiness.

However, facing the dangers arising from the invention of the atomic bomb, it is truly a greater responsibility than they should generally bear to ask science and scientists to assume the entire responsibility for preventing war waged with atomic weapons: The responsibility of scientists lies in explaining to the people the relationship between their inventions and peace and war! Because in this regard, they have special qualifications and special responsibilities. In addition, some scientists may feel that they cannot more or less participate in any scientific activities related to preparation and war, and consider this a matter of conscience for the people involved. The ultimate responsibility for using nuclear energy for peace or for war lies with the politicians engaged in political activities.

Scientists, like all citizens, have a responsibility to influence their country's policy on nuclear energy, just as they influence their country's other policies. Physicists played a decisive role in the invention of the atomic bomb, but the manufacture of these weapons requires the strength of all aspects of a modern country. Scientists alone cannot stop the manufacture of such weapons.

Due to the possibility of destructive war using atomic and thermonuclear weapons, the primary responsibility of scientists today is to help people from all walks of life recognize the terrible dangers we face and how to avoid them in the widest possible way. In this way, scientists can make a valuable contribution to the decisive task of establishing a powerful and widely representative institution that controls public opinion in all countries of the world without exception, an institution that can enable politicians around the world to resolve international disputes without force. In addition, scientists must also make everyone understand the dangers caused by the explosion tests in the modern arms race, the dangers caused by the radiation of these explosions, and their impact on the future and descendants of mankind. Although this issue is secondary compared to avoiding war, it is also extremely serious and urgent.

We have long known that ionizing radiation, such as that emitted from radioactive substances or that shown in cosmic rays, can cause changes in organisms, causing their descendants to produce something called mutants with new and unusual characteristics. These changes are not immediately apparent in their descendants. This latent defect, for example, may only manifest itself in two equally affected individuals. They are called recessive and may appear in the descendants of the original radiation sufferers many generations later.

Humans are constantly affected by cosmic rays. The intensity of this radiation on the Earth's surface is: a person affected by it will receive a radiation dose of about 0.1 roentgen per year. The roentgen is the standard unit of measurement. After atomic bomb explosion tests, large amounts of radioactive material are scattered in the air and widely blown around by high-altitude winds. Assuming that this radioactive material is evenly distributed on the ground, we can estimate how much additional radioactive material each person receives. This estimate varies, but a reasonable estimate is that after the explosion of a used thermonuclear weapon, each person will receive a radiation dose of 0.2 roentgen, equivalent to ten million tons of TNT explosives.

These figures show that if an average of five thermonuclear weapons are detonated each year, the radiation received by people around the world will be equal to twice the impact of cosmic radiation. What will be the result of this increase? Authorities have very different estimates of the impact of radioactivity on human eugenics. Experiments with fruit flies have shown that the cosmic ray radiation produces approximately one in a thousand harmful mutations in the observations. On the other hand, because it is difficult to experiment on humans, there is no accurate data. But in general, everyone agrees that the impact of radioactivity is even more serious. According to the estimated ratio of observed harmful mutations, cosmic rays alone have different roentgen levels of radioactivity ranging from 1% to 9%. Therefore, it is an urgent and important task to make a more accurate estimate of the increase in radiation generated by atomic and nuclear explosions and the subsequent eugenic impact on organisms.

Just the consideration of harmful mutations shows that the materials we can currently provide show that the atomic weapons explosion tests that have been carried out have produced serious consequences. Certainly, we have created human misfortune for future generations, but we do not yet know the magnitude of this misfortune. Until reliable materials on this issue are provided, the task of scientists is to stop more explosion tests and to support efforts to conduct independent scientific investigations into the consequences of explosion tests.

It is worth noting that the danger posed by atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons, even a brief explanation of the dangers posed by atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons that are currently restricted in use, once again emphasizes the great harm to all of humanity from the larger-scale use of these weapons in war. It can also be pointed out that this danger is caused by the use of so-called tactical atomic weapons.

Regarding the possibilities of construction provided by scientific development, the responsibility of scientists is equally important and more complex.

In human history, some people have played a very important role. These people see further than their neighbors what may develop in society, and they make these possible visions come alive in people's imaginations. By awakening new possibilities in people's imaginations, they powerfully help to realize these possible things. I believe that this is what Mr. Nehru meant when he called on scientists to play the role of prophets in the modern world. Scientists must become the prophets and poets of our time. Because their position allows them to clearly see the future vision from their inventions through their technical talents, as long as they are willing to engage in imaginative and creative thinking.

The great technological progress we are seeing now will be scientific and scientifically planned from the beginning. But the execution of the plan will require the enthusiastic support of all the people, and the vast majority of the people will not be scientists for many years to come. To gain this support, it must be made clear to people that the application of science in a peaceful world will bring enormous benefits. One of my great compatriots, the leader of the English Revolution and the founder of the new army, Cromwell, once said: "People must know why they fight and love the purpose they know."

If we do not get this sympathy and understanding of science from the people, we will not be able to obtain the rapid growth of scientific manpower, which is needed even for the currently planned technological development. For example, in the UK, by the year 2000, our rapidly growing demand for power will be largely obtained from uranium and thorium, which will require a large number of technical experts from the government, universities, and other industries. Although the demand for scientific manpower is growing rapidly, if a country does not pay enough attention to science, the vast majority of the country's best young people will study other subjects such as classical literature and humanities.

When the supply of capable scientific talents plays a decisive role in a country's strength, it is interesting to note the huge differences in the current ratio of students studying science and those studying arts and humanities in various countries. For example, the ratio of students studying science to other students in Soviet universities is five to one; in the UK it is one to one, and in Japan it is about three to seven. These figures are for reference only and can be reserved, because if students in technical schools and other schools are also considered, then the ratio of these figures may change somewhat, but even so, the existence of such large differences between countries is beyond doubt. If a country wants to keep up with the current development in science and industrial level without falling behind its neighbors, the proportion of young people engaged in scientific careers is indeed too small in many cases, and there is no doubt about this. If considered from these aspects, scientists have two very important responsibilities for the scientific development of their motherland. They must contribute to the popularization of science and explain the current great construction possibilities in imaginative ways. In this way, they help the development of science and the development of scientific talent in their country, winning the support they deserve, and both are important for meeting current needs and greatly increasing future needs.

The difficulties encountered by various countries in achieving these goals vary greatly, and only a couple of examples can be given here. Some industrialists express their view that there is no need to support their country's scientific tradition and engage in any large-scale research work, because contracting out can save money and make more profit, and development and research work can be carried out by institutions in other countries. This view, if implemented, would be a fatal blow to the country's scientific tradition; moreover, losing independence in science and technology means losing independence in all other aspects; this does not need to be emphasized. Therefore, the responsibility of scientists is to strongly oppose this tendency and everything else that undermines the development of a strong and independent national scientific tradition.

Finally, scientists have a third responsibility to their country, which may be a difficult one to fulfill. Certainly, the great industrial changes that we can foresee, the changes that make industry reach an unimaginable degree of scientific planning and scientific manipulation, will include a great reform of our social organization, as well as a wider use of planning and scientific methods in administration and government.

Therefore, we are faced with the problem of transitioning to a scientifically planned society in a world deeply divided by ideological differences that should not be resolved by war. The responsibility of scientists is to help find new methods suitable for their country to carry out this transition. The forms of this change are diverse throughout the world, because this change will ultimately be determined by the people of each country according to their history and traditions. However, in our era of constant change, creative imagination will also play a decisive role in finding new paths, and scientists can make a valuable contribution to this issue.

I only need to cite the example of Mr. Nehru, the founding chairman of the Indian Association of Scientific Workers and the great Prime Minister of India, to illustrate how profound an impact the imaginative, scientific, and creative research into the urgent problems of our time can have on a global scale. In this regard, it is necessary to be good at adapting. The great danger faced by many countries is that domestic vested interests are so powerful and national power is so great that even changes with obvious and urgent needs are difficult to achieve. Such countries, like similar obstinate countries in the past, will certainly fail to adapt to a rapidly changing world and will soon fall behind their neighbors in terms of strength and influence.

Finally, the third major responsibility that scientists should bear is to promote international cooperation in science. To the extent that science has relied on the free exchange of achievements and opinions among philosophers around the world until recently, it has always been international. We very reasonably hope that the conditions for the re-establishment of this exchange can be established again, because doing so is of great benefit to the people of the world. Because science has an increasingly significant meaning for the entire social life, we also have sufficient reason to demand a special strengthening of international cooperation in science.

On the one hand, we hope that science has true internationality, that is, all mankind can apply its results freely without restraint, but on the other hand, expanding the scope of international cooperation now also has significant meaning. The reason why the role of international science is strong is that it concentrates the various methods that representatives of different scientific traditions can use to solve common problems. Any scientist will inevitably express the cultural tradition of his own country to some extent, and each natural tradition has its own strengths and weaknesses. When scientists work together harmoniously, it is possible to correct each other's shortcomings and establish a common strength. This is because, considering that we want to strengthen international scientific cooperation, we must strengthen the individual natural scientific traditions, so that world science can be enriched by all the experiences and various cultural heritages of the people of all countries.

This makes it feel very important to establish scientific traditions in individual countries and in those countries where scientific traditions have always been ravaged. This is one of the most rewarding tasks and one of the most enlightened forms of egoism. If there must be a competition between major powers, then let them compete in this area, to see who can do the best in advancing all the benefits that we have already enjoyed to the deprived people of all countries.

Recently, the governments of some countries have taken many important actions, which have already played a great role in promoting international exchanges between scientists and promoting cooperation on other special issues. Even if these actions are limited to special groups in some countries, they will be warmly welcomed, but if their scope is further expanded, the effect will be even greater, so that upright scientists, regardless of their views on religion, politics, or other aspects, will be welcomed in any country.

Such a free attitude towards science and learning is not new in history. For example, as early as two thousand years ago, Indian universities in the Ganges Plain welcomed students and learned people from all over Asia and provided them with appropriate conditions to support their studies. Today, it is much easier for students to travel from all over the world to any place they choose. When the practical importance of learning has greatly exceeded the past, is it excessive to ask the governments of the world to begin to adopt a similar attitude towards learning?

Any government that adopts such an attitude will certainly gain benefits far beyond what it has spent. To give a small example to illustrate the benefits that can come with it, we know from our own experience how much the work of my own laboratory has benefited from being able to attract young people from many countries to cooperate with us. As a result of the free development of creativity, we have been able to complete an experimental plan together, and the results of this experimental plan are far beyond what was originally spent.

Any government that uses its national resources, even a small portion of its resources, to support international science within its territory will obtain similar benefits, but on an immeasurably larger scale.

In this brief speech, I have tried to point out some of the current social responsibilities of scientists. They can indeed play a respectable role in realizing the great future vision of mankind, but it is important to view their role for its own sake, and not to exaggerate its importance. It is the people of the world who determine the future destiny of mankind, but scientists can help them by using their professional knowledge and status to guide and encourage them. I think Mr. Nehru is right when he says that the future of mankind does not belong to politicians and businessmen, but to scientists. But this vision can only become a reality because the politicians and business administrators, industrial organizers and national organizers of that time have become scientists in their views on their own professions. At that time, all aspects of human affairs will be treated with scientific methods, and everyone will become scientists, only to varying degrees. However, the great conqueror of nature will not be a scientist, but the scientific method.

Finally, please allow me on this great occasion to pay tribute to the young scientists of China; the future of China will depend on you. From what I have said above, you will certainly realize that science in China must grow and become strong rapidly, not only to build your great country, but also to play its significant role in world science. When 600 million Chinese people with a long cultural tradition are deeply familiar with science, what a significant role will this have for world science!

Therefore, Chinese scientists are responsible not only to China, but also to the science of the whole world. I would like to express my good wishes to them here—just as I said to Swedish university students on another occasion, I wish them good luck and hope they persevere. I would like to quote a sentence said by Erasistratus, a great Greek philosopher more than two thousand years ago:

"Those who have no research experience will feel confused and blind when they use their intellect for the first time, and will soon stop due to fatigue and lack of intellect, just like a person who has never exercised trying to participate in a race. But a person with research experience, he repeatedly studies, never gives up exploring, not for a day or a night, but for his entire life. He never slackens, on the contrary, he pays attention to everything that seems to be related to his problem, until he finds the answer."

This is the true spirit of seeking knowledge that has remained unchanged throughout the ages.

Dear friends, I would like to thank you for your kindness to me. Please allow me to express the most sincere gratitude of the World Federation of Scientific Workers for your deep hospitality and support for us at this conference. On behalf of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, I hope that the discussions of this Council will also slightly promote the scientific development of great China.

    在世界科协成立十周年纪念大会上的发言
    科学家的社会责任
    世界科学工作者协会副主席世界科学工作者协会执行理事会主席
    鲍威尔教授
    一　我们这个时代的重要意义
    我们现在开始被人了解：由于我们生活在人类历史上这一伟大而有决定性的时代里，我们就有着自己所要担当的责任，也有着许多良好的机会，虽然这种认识还待进一步地深究和掌握。以前任何时代的人都没有遇到过这么尖锐的矛盾情况。在我们这个时代里将要决定下面这个问题：人类从原始不开化、经由野蛮而到文明这样的漫长而痛苦的发展，以后会通向光辉灿烂的未来呢？还是在一次使用原子武器的战争中遭受惨重的打击，以致剩下来的受尽摧残的人类在一个奇怪的世界中从头开始生活呢？在那样一个世界里，即使地球上幸存的动植物也都是奇特而支离破损的。
    目前的这些危险和良机是伟大的科学发现——原子能的发掘——所造成的结果，而这一发现又是五十年来研究的结果。在我们支配下的能力有这样巨大发展，这并不是偶然的。这是人们对如何取得有关自然的知识和控制自然的问题，进行有意识探求的必然结果，在人类历史来说，现在所采取的探求方法还是较新的。这种新方法——科学方法——的发展，是我们时代的巨大而突出的特点。
    在过去已经有过许多伟大的发现和技术革新，使人类社会起了许多巨大的变化。但是约五千年前文明尚未建立起来的时候，这种发现和革新是非常稀少的。生火和使用火的方法的发现，就是这类的一个革新。我们不知道这最初是在什么时候发现的，有些权威人士说是在十万年以前。人能用火，这对早期的社会来说，一定是极端重要的。有了火，就可以煮某些不煮就不能吃的东西，这样就增加了最初定居下来的人们的食物供应。随着时间的发展，人们可以熔炼金属了，这样就产生了新的工具，又由于应用新的工具而使许多方面发生了变化。
    狭义说来，人类的整个历史可以视为“火”发现以后的结果，这个发现的极大意义早已在很多原始的、民族的传说中被承认下来，并被纪念着。今天与我们有关的种种伟大发现以及这些发现在目前还只能模糊地看到的后果，都是过去的种种发明所导源下来的；但是它们对人类生活的意义，是远远的超越过以往的任何事物。
    在未开化的时代，技术进展的速度之慢，已由下列事实说明：从“火”发现以后，一直过了好几万年，才能用火来熔炼铁：只在五千年以前才第一次使用铁和铁制工具。但是，随着人类日益生活于更广大和相对来说更固定的社会中，艺术和手工艺的种类大为增加了！日积月累的技术和经验也一代代流传下来。
    虽然在文明方面已经有了这些特点，但是和我们的现代社会比起来，进展的速度还是颇为缓慢的，当时的革新大多数是在偶然的观察和碰巧的情况下发生的，而不是由于深入探索事务本质的结果。但是不久之后，就发生一次巨大的变化了。
    十五世纪的中叶，在西欧——特别在意大利——开始了一个实践的、智慧的和艺术的热烈创造时期，就是人们常谈的文艺复兴时期。人类被狭隘的宗教教条束缚了几百年，这时挣脱出来了！在新的自由精神之中，他们开始对自己的力量有了信心。一种新的精神出现了，它使人们渐渐相信：为了解决他们遇到的问题，仅依赖像亚里斯多德这样的一些古代权威是不够的。为了增进知识，人们就必须自己动手来进行研究。
    达·芬奇说：“他们会说，我既然不是一个学者，我将无法适当地表达我所要叙述的事情。但是他们不知道与我有关的问题一定会被理解，不过不是通过其他人的文字，而是通过实验。实验素来是写作能力好的那些人的爱人，所以，在各种情况下，我都引用她的名字。”
    达·芬奇又说：“许多人将相信我会受到谴责的，因为我的试验与某些人的权威相抵触，而这些人的论断是受到人们尊敬的，虽然这些论断不是以经验为根据的，但是应当考虑到，我的结论是从简单朴素的经验，也就是从真正的爱人那里得出来的。”
    在此后一百年的过程中，这种新的探索精神渐渐得到发展，并有强有力的新同盟者出来支持它，如英国的培根和法国的笛卡儿等人。这些人不仅深信发扬新的探索精神所必需的正确的方法，而且对这种探索本身的目的也具有深刻的信心。他们相信必须靠实验来研究自然，而且这种探索的目的是要以新的发明和财富来充实人类的生活。培根的哲学表达了一种对人类的深沉的爱；这种爱使最聪明的人也不会不重视所有的事物，而这种重视能够给最卑贱的人带来快乐，也能够带来痛苦。对他来说，新的科学方法应当有助于人们的实际需要，而不应当让烦琐哲学的空想来破坏。在这点上，他的确是对空想和理论表示过轻蔑，而这种空想和理论，我们现在知道都是些无的放矢的东西。
    在培根的工作以后的五十年中，他的见解受到欧洲许多国家的大力支持，为了使这种新的探索精神产生实际效果，许多学术团体也建立起来了。如牛顿所发现的万有引力定律这类的重大成就已经取得了，但是这种实验的、批判的新方法是在
  “工业革命”的时候才显出其重要的优越性。“工业革命”在十八世纪末叶和十九世纪初叶的时候，把英国从一个农业国变成了一个巨大的工厂。
    自从十九世纪中叶以来，我们越来越明显地看到，科学的方法在人类事务里是越来越广泛地被应用着。然而，这还远远没有达到充分发展的程度。这种求新知识的方法，比过去的任何方法都要有效得多，这就使技术革新一个接着一个越来越
  迅速，而且是穿流不息地出现。在我们这
  里许多人的一生里，就看到了许多东西，
  只举出其中少数几个例子，譬如电子和爱
  克斯光，无线电报和无线电传真，内燃机和燃气涡轮，汽车和飞机，放射能，原子能和氢弹。在古代，这些发现中的任何一件都会成为某一个世纪的标志。
    极为重要的是我们必须清楚地认识到，我们已经进入了人类历史上的一个变化重大的时代，有人叫这个时代为第二次工业革命时代，这种叫法把这个时代的重要性减少了，模糊起来了。贝尔纳教授已经指出，现在所发生的变化，其规模之庞大远远超过工业革命；这种变化虽然表现在工业方面，但是说得更确切些，它的主要精神是在科学方面，而非技术方面，人们甚至可以把它叫做科学革命，因为科学不只是用于改变工业，实际上它也在引导这种变化。他说：“将来的工业，可以从科学的角度去想像，科学地去计划和进行，其程度是我们现在无法想像的。”
    这个新时代的特点就是无止境的技术革新，以及因此而产生的许多良好时机和错综复杂的情况。我们必须不让氢弹的发展标志着这个时代的结束，而让它标志着一个时代的开始。如果想预测未来事态发展的方向，就一定要把新的发现和革新的可能性估计在内。1939年发现的原子分裂和1945年第一个原子弹的爆炸相隔只不过六年光景，其后还不到十年，又发明了比原子弹威力大一千多倍的氢弹。
    我们这个时代的困难处境，就是在人们做出许多激烈的政治决定的这个世界里，由于原子能的发现，使我们必须做出如下的抉择：或是大国之间进行和解，以便共同寻求共处的办法；或者用核子武器进行战争。如果政治上的分歧得到和平解决，那么我们就有理由可以预言：紧张局势会得到缓和，军备会得到裁减，以及因此而解放出来的科学的和有创造性的力量会被迅速而有效地应用于提高全世界人民生活水平的这个迫切问题上面。毫无疑问，只要找到了这种解决问题的办法，那末人类的前途就会很快地改变面貌：今后五十年里，目前我们所受到的危险，痛苦和焦虑，都将被同情地视为是科学时代以前的一个时期里人类的愚蠢所造成的后果。另一方面，如果一旦在大国之间发生原子武器和热核子武器的战争，那末毫无疑问，地球上很大一部分居民以及在人类文明时期所获得的大部分成就最后都将被毁灭，在目前疯狂的核子武器军备竞争的情况下，很多权威人士的确感到这种定期爆炸试验所产生的效果足以对整个人类带来严重损害。
    这情况给了全世界各种专业的科学家们一个严重的责任。这种伟大的新力量，不管它是好的或是坏的，都是通过科学和科学家才发现的。因为这种巨大的毁坏力量都是这种新发现所生产出来的第一批产品，所以无怪全世界善良的人们有时要对科学侧目而视。
  二　科学和科学家们的
            道德威信
    约十年前，紧接着世界科协成立以后，约里奥·居里教授在他出版的小册子的导言里写道：“在这一代以前，没有人严重地怀疑过，作为人类精神最高品质表帜的科学，是物质和精神利益的最丰富的来源之一。诚然，在人民中间散播科学知识的行动方向就遇到沉迷于神秘主义和迷信里的人的强大抵抗，以及那些靠着在自己统辖下的庶民的懦弱无知来维持自己利益和特权的人们的强大抵抗。由于早期滥用了在科学上的成就而造成了许多困难和非正义的事情，但是人民对科学的信心还是不断在稳步上升。
    过去五十年里所发生的事情，显著地改变了这一普遍的态度，从上世纪末叶以来，科学所产生的一些坏的后果，使人们日益频繁地感到忧虑与苦恼。有些人甚至对作为文明要素之一的科学的价值也怀疑起来了。最近发生的原子弹事件，更增加了科学家们自己在思想上的混乱，以及人们对科学所抱的态度的混乱。”
    人们对科学抱着这种猜疑态度，有时候甚至敌对的态度，这种情况即使只在少数国家内存在，也必须使科学家们看作是很严重的事情。几百年来，保证科学的繁荣和壮大的重要因素，就是科学家在道德上所享有的崇高威望。人尽皆知，在这几百年里，他们全心全意地献身于人类进步这一伟大目标；在这几百年里，再引用约里奥—居里教授的话来说，毫无疑问，“科学知识驱逐了迷信和人们对于看不见的力量的恐惧，给我们的精神带来了平安和对人类进步的坚定信心，同时也使我们更清楚地了解到我们在宇宙中的地位。”
    撇开了道德威望和人民的支持，要科学担负起目前情况可能赋与它的这一有决定性意义的伟大任务，那是不可能的。我们当前所处形势，要求大家最大限度地把科学方法广泛运用到人类事业的各个方面去。我们当前所处的形势，要求我们把每一个国家科学家的人数增加很多倍，同时为他们提供工作中所必要的一切技术条件。要是没有公众的广泛支持，一个国家的科学潜力是不能很快地发挥，甚或会延搁。科学家的工作将不但会苦于缺乏实验用的适当工具，而且也会苦于缺乏外来的鼓励，这种鼓励是来自群众对他们工作的关心和尊敬。
    为了使科学享有它早就享有的群众支持——至少在一些国家中已存在着失去这种支持的危险——科学家必须要用他们的行动来说明他们是非常关心现在人类所面临的一些重大问题的。说明如果必要的话，他们准备作出个人的牺牲，以保证科学不被滥用于破坏的目的，而被广泛地用来增进人类的幸福。
    然而，面临着由于原子弹的发明而产生的危险，人们就要求科学和科学家，承担整个防止用原子武器进行的战争的责任，这实是比他们一般应当承担的责任还要
  更大的责任：科学家们的责任，就在于向
  人民说明他们的发明对和平和战争的关系！因为在这方面，他们有特殊的资格和特殊的责任。此外，有些科学家们，也许
  会感到：他们无法或多或少地参与有关筹备和备战的任何科学活动，而认为这是有关人士的良心问题。把核子能用于和平或用于战争，其最后责任却在从事政治活动的政治家身上。
    科学家和所有的公民们同样负有责任，来影响他们国家关于核子能的政策，正如影响他们国家的其他政策一样。在发明原子弹的时候，物理学家们，起了决定性的作用，然而在制造这些武器方面，则需要一个现代国家的各方面的力量，单靠科学家是无法制止这种武器的制造的。
    由于使用原子和热核子武器进行毁灭性战争的可能性存在，当前科学家们的主要责任，就是要最广泛地帮助各界人民认清我们所面临的可怕的危险，以及怎样才能避免这种危险的方法。这样，科学家们对于在全世界各国毫无例外地建立一个强大的而具有广泛代表性和掌握着社会舆论的机构这样一个有决定意义的任务，就能够作出有价值的贡献，而这样的机构能够使全世界的政治家不用武力而解决国际间的纷争。此外，科学家们也必须使大家了解就是在现代军备竞赛中的爆炸试验所要引起的危险，使大家了解由于这种爆炸的放射作用所引起的危险以及它们对人类的未来和后代所产生的影响。虽然这个问题和避免战争比较起来还属于次要地位，但也是极其严重和急迫的。
    我们很早就知道游离放射，如从放射物质中所发出的那些东西，或者宇宙射线中所显出的那些东西会在生物身上产生变化，使他们的子孙身上产生一种带有新的和非寻常性格的叫突变种的东西。这些变化并不是立刻就在他们的子孙身上显现出来的。这种潜伏的缺点，举例说，可能只在两个受到同样影响的个人身上表现出来，它们被称为隐性，并可能出现在原始放射受难者的许多代以后的子孙的身上。
    人类经常受着宇宙射线的这种影响。这种放射性在地球表面上的强度是：在一个受到它影响的人身上，一年内将受到大约0.1伦的放射剂量。伦是这种衡量的标准单位。原子弹爆炸试验以后，大量的放射性散布在空气中，又被高空的风广泛地吹散到各地。假定这种放射性平均地散布在地面上，我们可以估计出每个人受到多少这种外加的放射性。这种估计是各不相同，但是合理的估计，是在一种已经使用过的热核子武器爆炸之后，在每个人身上会受到0.2伦的放射剂量，相当于一千万吨的梯恩梯炸药。
    这些数字说明，如果平均每年爆炸五颗热核子武器，那么全世界人们所受到的放射力将等于他们受宇宙放射影响的二倍。这种增加会产生什么结果呢？各权威人士对于放射性对人类优生学上所产生的影响估计很不相同。用果蝇作的试验说明了宇宙线幅射所产生透射在被观察中伤害突变里面大约是一千之中有一个，另一方面，由于对人类难于作试验，所以没有精确的材料。但一般说来，大家都同意放射性的影响是更加严重的。据观察伤害突变比例的估计，仅仅是宇宙射线本身就有从1％到9％的不同的伦的放射性。因此，对原子和核子爆炸所产生的放射力的增加以及随后的对生物的优生学上的影响作出一个更精确的估计，是一件急迫而且重要的工作。
    只是涉及到伤害突变这方面的考虑，表明了我们目前所能提供的材料是已进行的原子武器爆炸试验产生了严重的后果。肯定地，我们已给后代制造了人类的不幸，但这不幸的大小我们还不知道。直到提供了有关这问题的可靠材料，科学家的任务是制止更多的爆炸试验，并为争取对爆炸试验的后果进行独立的科学调查予以支持。
    值得注意的是对原子武器和热核子武器所产生的危险这一点，甚至对仅从目前被限制使用的原子武器和热核子武器中产生的危险的简短说明，再一次着重地说明了战争中更大规模地使用这些武器对整个人类的极大危害。还可以举出这种危险是由于使用了所谓的战术原子武器而产生的。
    关于由于科学的发展而提供了建设的可能性，科学家的责任是同样的重要，而且更加复杂。
    在人类历史上，有些人就曾起过极大的作用。这些人对于在社会上可能发展的东西比他们的邻居看得远一点，他们使这些可能发展的远景在人们的想像中成为活现的东西。由于在人们的想像中唤起了新的可能实现的东西，他们就有力地帮助了这些可能的事物的实现。我相信，尼赫鲁先生号召科学家应起现代世界预言者的作用，就是这个意思。科学家一定要成为我们这个时代的预言家和诗人。因为由于他们所处的地位，使他们可以通过他们技术才能从他们的发明里清楚地看到未来的远景，只要他们是肯于从事具有幻想和创造性的思考的话。
    我们现在看到的伟大的技术上的进步，将在一开始时就是科学的并且是科学地计划出来的。但是计划的执行将需要所有人民的热情支持，而广大的人民在今后的许多年代里，绝大多数却都不会是科学家。要获得这种支持，必须使人们清楚地看到在一个和平世界中科学的应用会带来巨大的好处。我的一位伟大的同胞、英国革命领导者和新式军队的创始者克伦威尔曾经说过：“人民必须知道他们为什么而战斗，并爱他们所知道的目的。”
    如果我们从人民方面得不到这种对科学的同情和了解，我们就不可能获得科学方面的人力很快的增长，这种人力即使是对目前有计划的技术开展来说也是需要的。例如在英国，到二千年的时候，我们飞快增长的对动力的需求，大部分将从铀和钍取得，这就需要从政府、各大学和其他工业方面得到大量的技术专家，虽然对科学方面的人力需求是在飞速增长，假如一个国家对科学重视不够的话，该国最优秀的青年中就会有绝大部分的人去学习诸如古典文学和人文学之类的其他学科。
    当有能力的科学人材的供应对一个国家的力量起着决定性作用的时候，注意一下目前各国学习科学和学习艺术和人文学的学生人数比例上的巨大差异，是很有趣的。例如，苏联大学里学科学的学生与其他学生的比例是五比一；英国是一比一，日本大约是三比七。这些数字仅供参考，尚可有所保留，因为如果把技术学校和其他学校中的学生也加以考虑，那末这些数字的比例也许会有些变化，但是即使如此，各国间之存在着这种极大的差异是毋庸置疑的，如果一个国家要在科学与工业水平方面跟上现在的发展而不落在它邻国之后，很多情况中，从事于科学事业的青年的人数比例实在是太小了，这也是没有疑问的。如果从这些方面来考虑，科学家对自己祖国的科学发展方面负有两个非常重要的责任。他们必须在普及科学方面作出贡献，用富有想像力的办法来说明目前伟大的建设可能性。这样他们就帮助了本国科学的发展和科学人材力量的发展而赢得应有的支持，而这两者对于满足目前需要和将来大大增长的需求方面，是很重要的。
    各国达到这些目的时所遇到的困难有着很大的不同，这里只能举一两个例子。有些工业家们发表他们的看法，认为再没有什么必要去支持他们本国的科学传统和从事于任何大规模的研究工作了，因为按合同办事可以更省钱，获利更多，发展和研究工作可以让其他国家的机构来进行。这种看法，如果实行的话，对该国科学传统是一个致命伤；而且，在科学和技术方面丧失了独立，就是在其他各方面丧失了独立；这是不用强调的。因此，科学家们的责任就是要强烈地反对这种倾向，和其他要破坏强大而独立的国家科学传统的发展的一切事物。
    最后，科学家对他的国家还有一个第三个责任，这可能是难尽到的一个责任。肯定地说，我们能预见的工业方面的巨大变革、使工业达到不能想像的科学计划和科学操纵的程度的那种变革中，将包括我们社会组织形式的很大改革，以及行政管理和政府中更广泛的使用计划和科学的方法。
    因此，我们就面临了这个问题：在一个不应用战争来解决的思想意识的分歧所深深分割了的世界上，要过渡到科学计划的社会。科学家们的责任就是要帮助找出适合于他们国家进行这种过渡的新方法。这种变革的形式在全世界是多种多样的，因为这种变革最终将由各国人民根据其历史与传统来决定。但是，在环境不断变化的我们的时代中，创造性的想像在找出新的途径方面，也会起决定性的作用，在这个问题上，科学家们可以作出有价值的贡献。
    我只要举出印度科学工作者协会创始主席、伟大的印度总理尼赫鲁先生的例子来说明：对于我们时代的迫切问题进行富有想像的、科学的和创造性的研究，能够在世界范围内发生多么深远的影响。在这方面，就是要善于适应。很多国家所面临的巨大危险是，国内的既得利益非常强大，国家的权力非常巨大，因而使有着明显而急迫需要的变革，也很难实现。这种国家，正如过去那些类似的固执不变的国家一样，一定会无法使自己适应于一个迅速变化的世界，而会很快地在力量和影响方面落于他们的邻国之后。
    最后，科学家在第三方面所应负起的重大责任是促进科学方面的国际合作。就直到最近科学仍有赖于全世界的哲学家自由交换成果和意见这点来讲，它一直是有着国际性的。我们非常合理地希望现在就建立起这种交流能再度恢复的条件，因为这样做对世界各国人民都有很大的好处。由于科学对于整个社会生活有着越来越重大的意义，因此我们也就有充分的理由要求特别加强在科学方面的国际合作。
    一方面，我们希望科学具有真正的国际性，也就是说全人类都可毫无拘束地应用它的成果，但另一方面扩大国际合作的范围现在还有重大意义的。国际性科学的作用之所以强大，就是因为它集中了不同科学传统的代表们可用以解决共同问题的各式各样的方法。任何科学家都要不可避免地在某种程度上表露出他自己国家的文化传统，而每种自然传统都有它自己的力量和弱点。当科学家们在一起和谐地工作时，才有可能改正彼此的缺点和建立一种共同的力量。这是因为考虑到要想加强国际科学合作，就必须加强个别的自然科学传统，这样世界科学就可以由于各国人民的一切经验和各种不同的文化遗产而更加丰富起来。
    这就使人感到在各别国家以及在那些科学传统一向被蹂躏的国家内建立科学传统是非常重要的。这是一种最有报酬的任务也是一种最开明的利己主义。如果大国间一定要进行竞赛的话，那就让它们在这方面竞赛，看谁能够在使一向被剥夺的我们很多人已经享有的全部利益的各国人民前进这方面做得最好。
    最近有些国家的政府已采取了很多重要行动，这对于促进科学家之间的国际交流以及促进在其他特殊问题的合作方面已经起了很大的作用。这种行动即或只限于一些国家的特殊团体，也将受到热烈的欢迎，但是如果它们的范围再扩大一些，效果就会更大，这样，正直的科学家不论他们对宗教、政治或其他方面所持的看法如何，在任何国家都会受到欢迎的。
    这样一种对科学和学问的自由态度在历史上是并不新奇的。例如远在两千年以前，在恒河平原的印度各大学就欢迎来自亚洲各地的学生和有学问的人，并供给他们适当的条件以支持他们的学习，今天，学生们要从全世界各处到任何他们所选择的地方去旅行是容易得多了。当学问的实际重要性已大大超过以往的时候，请求世界各国政府开始对学问采取一种类似的态度难道是过份的么？
    任何采取了这样一种态度的政府肯定会获得远非它所出的代价所能相比的好处。举一个小小的例子说明可以随之而来的好处吧，我们从自身的经验中知道，由于我们能够吸引了许多个国家的青年人来与我们合作，我自己的实验室的工作得到了多大的好处，由于创造力得到自由发展，结果我们能够一起完成了一项实验计划，这个实验计划所产生的结果是远非原来所出的代价所能相比的。
    任何把国家的资源，那怕是很小的一份资源，用来在它的境内支持国际科学的政府都会获得类似的好处，但却是不可衡量的更大规模的好处。
    在这篇简短的发言里，我已经设法指出了当前科学家的某些社会责任，他们对于实现人类伟大的未来的美景，的确可以起受人尊敬的作用，但是重要的是，必须就他们作用的本身来看他们的作用，而不要夸大它的重要性。决定人类未来命运的是全世界的人民，但是，科学家能够帮助他们，办法是用自己的专业知识和地位来引导他们，鼓励他们。我认为尼赫鲁先生说得很对，他说人类的未来不属于政客和商人，而属于科学家。但是这种远景之所以能够成为现实，仅仅是由于那时的政客和商业管理者，工业组织者和国家的组织者，在他们对自己的专业的看法上来说，已经变成了科学家。那时人类事务的各个方面，都将用科学的方法来对待，所有的人都会变成科学家，只有程度上的不同而已。但是，伟大的自然征服者将不是科学家，而是科学的方法。
    最后，请允许我在这个伟大的场合上，向中国的青年科学家们致敬；中国的前途就将要依靠你们。从我上面讲的话里诸位一定会体会到，科学在中国之所以必须迅速地成长并强大起来，并不仅仅是为了建设你们伟大的国家，而且是为了在世界科学中起它的重大作用。当具有悠久文化传统的六亿中国人民深刻地熟悉了科学，这对世界科学是有着多么重大的作用啊！
    因此，中国科学家不仅对中国，而且还对全世界的科学负有责任。我谨在这里向他们表示善意的愿望——正如我在另一场合向瑞典大学生们所说的话一样，我祝他们幸运并希望他们坚持努力。我想向他们引用两千多年前的一位希腊大哲学家依拉西斯特杜斯曾说过的一句话：
    “那些没有研究经验的人，在第一次使用他们的智力的时候，是会感到混乱和盲目，并且很快就由于疲劳和缺乏智力而中止，就好像一个素无锻炼的人试图参加赛跑一样。但是一个有研究经验的人，他反复钻研，绝不放弃探求，不是一天或一夜，而是他整个一生。他从不懈怠，相反地，他注意每一件似乎与他的问题有关的事物，直到他求到答案为止。”
    这就是亘古不变的真正的求知精神。
    亲爱的朋友们，我谨向你们对我的好意致谢。请允许我代表世界科学工作者协会，对你们的深厚款待和在这次大会上对我们的支持表示最热诚的谢意。我代表世界科协，并且希望本届理事会的讨论会对伟大的中国的科学发展也稍有推进。
