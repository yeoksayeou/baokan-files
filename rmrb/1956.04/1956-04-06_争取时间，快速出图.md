    Strive for Time, Quickly Produce Drawings
    By our reporter Fu Dong
    One day a year ago, it was already very late at night, and young technician Zhang Fengtai was tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep. His heart was churning like a tide. During the day, the Youth League branch organizing committee member had talked to him about the issue of over-age Youth League members leaving the League. At that moment, he felt that time was passing too quickly, and he couldn't help but think about what he had actually done this year!
    Zhang Fengtai still clearly remembered the excitement he felt when he was assigned to the Anshan Ferrous Metallurgical Design Company in April 1954 after graduating from school. When he stood in the large rolling mill, watching the rolling mill automatically roll thick, short, red-hot steel billets into long, thin steel rails, he was so happy that he couldn't speak for a long time. He fantasized that he would soon be designing such a rolling mill.
    However, he never expected that when he was officially assigned a job, he would be assigned to the switchgear group in the metallurgical equipment section. When his superiors asked him to draw switchgear parts, he felt really wronged: this switchgear looked like a loquat, what was so good about drawing it, especially since he was just helping others to draw it. This idea made him unable to muster any enthusiasm.
    Once, Zhang Fengtai was drawing the standard drawing for a telephone distribution box. He felt that this five-inch-sized gadget only needed to be drawn in one or two drawings and didn't take it seriously at all. He didn't even sharpen his pencil properly before starting to draw, so the lines he drew were thick and thin, and the circles he drew were not round enough. When it came to drawing the drilling locations, he drew them as tapped holes. Originally, this matter was quite simple, and he only needed to ask the veteran comrades, but Zhang Fengtai felt that drilling holes and tapped holes were similar, and it didn't matter if he made a mistake. He handed in the drawing in this muddled way. The drawing was soon returned, and it needed to be completely reworked. The section leader had made a mess of it with red pen. Zhang Fengtai redrew it and sent it to the Soviet telecommunications expert, who made many more suggestions and said that he should show it to him again after it was revised. Zhang Fengtai drew it a second time, but it still didn't pass. The Soviet expert from the telecommunications section criticized him: "The drawing is too sloppy, the scale is not accurate." The expert from the metallurgical equipment section, Nadimov, called him in and said: "Don't think that the telephone distribution box is small, so you don't care. This kind of standard equipment you draw will be produced in large quantities in the future, and even a small mistake will cause great losses to the country." He spent a month and a half drawing this set of drawings, but he couldn't finish it. In the end, he had to ask the best draftsman in the section to finish it. Thinking of this, Zhang Fengtai's face flushed, and his cheeks felt hot.
    Thinking and thinking, he remembered the criticism of a comrade in the section a few days ago. This comrade was quite good at drawing, and the organization transferred him to the Anshan Iron and Steel basic construction design office, but he refused to go no matter what. He felt that the organization didn't value him, so they transferred him away. At the Youth League branch meeting, many Youth League members criticized him. Zhang Fengtai thought: "Isn't my ideological problem of always thinking about drawing big machines and not drawing small parts properly similar to that of the comrade who was criticized?" Thinking of this, he hated and scolded himself. Then, he thought of the care the League gave him. In his work, the Youth League branch secretary often came to ask him: "How is your work going? Is there any problem that needs help?" The more he thought about it, the more sad he felt, and the scene of the manufacturing unit coming to the section to negotiate changes to the design drawing appeared before his eyes again. The manufacturing unit spent a lot of effort to make the machine parts according to the design drawing, but many of them didn't fit together or couldn't be installed, so they had to return the drawing and ask for it to be changed, which caused great difficulties and losses to the construction. Not many days ago, a comrade in the section designed a two-meter switchgear, and only made a mistake in one place, which caused a loss of seven or eight hundred yuan and delayed the installation time by half a month. How can this phenomenon be eliminated?
    One day, the Youth League branch held a large meeting. Twenty-year-old Shi Meifen introduced her advanced work experience at the meeting. Shi Meifen is a draftsman in the metallurgical equipment section, and she draws very well. This girl is also an active figure in the section. In addition to serving as the union organizing committee member, she also attends night university. Every day, she finds out about the next day's work in advance, makes an arrangement, and then does it according to the plan the next day. After listening to this, Zhang Fengtai thought to himself, Shi Meifen's method is quite good, why don't I also make a plan? Later, after get off work every day, he recorded what he had done today, what problems he had found in his work, and what problems he should solve tomorrow. After recording for some time, he felt that his work began to have a pattern.
    In May, a new task came, drawing a tilting machine. Zhang Fengtai is the person in charge of this drawing group. He must first make a technical design, and the other dozen or so comrades in the group can help with the construction design. When he received this task, he was very anxious, could he complete fifteen quotas in a month? Even he himself couldn't answer this question. He had been drawing for a year, but he never had an accurate number. This time it was three days for one drawing, the next time it might be three and a half days for one drawing. Sometimes in the middle of drawing, everyone joked, erased mistakes and redrew, which took even longer. But he didn't care what, he always took three days to draw one as the standard to make a plan. Thinking of this, Zhang Fengtai laughed, this is like a person who eats every day, has eaten for many years, and still doesn't know how many bowls of rice he eats in one meal. Measure how capable you are? As a result, one test showed that he could draw one drawing in two days. After that, he made work plans according to his own ability, the characteristics of the task, and the various factors that affected the work, and used the "work diary" to summarize and check.
    One day, Zhang Fengtai found an article written by Zhu Jiegui on the blackboard newspaper in the office corridor. This article was very attractive to him, and he finished reading it in one breath. Zhu Jiegui talked about how he drew twenty-one design drawings in one month. This gave him a great stimulus. Zhu Jiegui and he were classmates in the same class, and they used to study at the Northeast Institute of Technology together. Look at how much people have progressed in the past year or so, while he can barely draw fourteen drawings a month. He should learn from Zhu Jiegui! He thought as he walked. Zhu Jiegui is right, in addition to improving the drawing method, the preparation of tools is also very important.
    Once, the section worked overtime to rush out the construction design drawings for the telephone distribution cabinet. Zhang Fengtai was not familiar with this project, so he had agreed with Ge Rongjia in the group to ask Ge to prepare the reference drawings and planned drawings first. It was really strange, that day he drew four drawings the size of a newspaper in one breath. When he returned to the dormitory at night, he sat down and carefully recalled the day's work. What made him draw so many drawings all of a sudden? He recalled the busy and chaotic work he usually did. Often in the middle of drawing, he suddenly found that he had to refer to the reference drawing to continue drawing. To borrow it from the drawing library, he had to check the cards in the cabinet himself, which took half an hour to flip through. Sometimes he couldn't find it even after searching for one or two hours, so he had to go back to the office building to ask the veteran comrades. After the card was found, it would take the librarian at least ten minutes to take it out, and he would have to count it again, hundreds of drawings, it would take a while to count. The drawing had to go through many procedures to get out of the library, and he had to get an exit permit, and the drawing library and he had to stamp it. What was even more terrible was that sometimes after searching for a long time, the drawing he took back had no reference value at all. Sometimes when he was concentrating on drawing, the pencil broke, and there was no spare, and it took a lot of time to find a knife to sharpen the pencil. He deeply realized the importance of seriously treating every small task. It seems that a knife, a reference drawing and a great project are just some insignificant "trivial matters", isn't it precisely because many designers have not seriously done these "trivial matters" that they have wasted a lot of valuable time in vain!
    In this way, Zhang Fengtai summed up the following from the lessons of his work: "Working seriously, planned and prepared, and striving for every minute of time is the main key to improving work efficiency!" This is not only a working method, but also marks the improvement of Zhang Fengtai's ideological awareness. Because only a person who wholeheartedly wants to do a good job can cherish time and effectively organize his work comprehensively. Zhang Fengtai himself proved this with his actions. Now, in Zhang Fengtai's "work diary", the number of drawing a dozen drawings a month can no longer be found. Since August last year, he has broken the quota and constantly created new records. By January this year, he could draw 32.9 drawings the size of a newspaper, and the quality was first-class. He does the design work of two people alone.
    If the designers of the whole country can improve their work efficiency by one time like Zhang Fengtai, it will be equivalent to greatly strengthening our design force, which will change the current situation that the design cannot catch up with the construction, and it will accelerate the speed of industrial construction!

    争取时间，快速出图
    本报记者　傅冬
    一年前的一天，夜已经很深了，青年技术员张凤台躺在床上翻来复去怎么也睡不着。他的心里像浪潮一样翻滚沸腾。白天青年团支部组织委员跟他曾谈到超龄青年团员退团的问题。这时他觉得时间过得太快了，情不自禁的想到，自己这一年究竟作了些什么呢！
    张凤台还清楚地记得，1954年4月刚从学校分配到鞍山黑色冶金设计公司时的兴奋心情，当他站在大型轧钢厂里，看那轧钢机自动地把一根根很粗很短火红滚烫的钢坯轧成细长的钢轨的时候，他高兴得很久都说不出话来，他幻想着自己马上就会设计这种轧钢机。
    可是，哪想到正式分配工作的时候，却把自己分到冶金设备科开闭器小组。当上级叫他画开闭器零件的时候，他真是一肚子的委屈：这开闭器就像个枇杷似的，有什么好画呢，何况自己还是打下手帮别人画。这种想法使他一直提不起劲儿来。
    有一次，张凤台画电话分线盒的标准图，他觉得这五寸大的小玩意也只要画一、二张图就可以了，根本没放在眼里。他连铅笔都没好好削一削就画起来了，结果画出来的线条有粗有细，画的圆形也不够圆。该到画钻孔的地方，他画成了丝孔。本来这事挺简单，只要开口问一问老同志就行，可是张凤台觉得钻孔和丝孔差不多，错了也没什么。他就这样稀里糊涂把图交上去了。这张图不久就给退回来了，要全部返工，图上面小组长用红笔改得一蹋糊涂。张凤台重画了一遍，送给苏联电讯专家，专家又提了很多意见，并且说改好后再拿给他看看。张凤台画了第二遍，又没有通过。电讯科苏联专家批评他：“画的太草率，比例尺不准。”冶金设备科的专家那得莫夫把他叫去说：“不要以为电话分线盒小就不在意，你画的这种标准设备将来要大批生产，错一点就给国家造成很大的损失。”这套图他前前后后画了一个半月也没画出来，最后还是请科里最好的制图员给画完了。张凤台想到这里，满脸发烧，两颊觉得热辣辣的。
    想着想着，他又想起前些天批评科里一个同志的事情。这个同志画起图来挺有几下子，组织上调他去鞍钢基本建设设计处工作，他说什么也不肯。他觉得组织上不重视他才把他调走。在团支部大会上许多团员批评了他。张凤台想：“自己一天到晚老想着画大机器，不好好画小零件，这种思想上的毛病不是和被批评的那个同志差不多吗？”想到这里，他恨得骂起自己来。接着，他又想到团对自己的关怀。工作中，团支部书记经常来问他：“工作得怎么样？有什么问题需要人帮助？”他越想越难过，眼前又浮现了制造单位到科里交涉改设计图时的情景。制造单位费了半天劲按设计图作出的机件，好多合不拢、按不上，只好把图退回来叫改，给施工造成了很大的困难和损失。不多天以前，科里有个同志设计二米开闭器，只画错了一个地方，就损失了七、八百元，拖延了半个月的按装时间。怎么能消除这种现象呢？
    有一天，团支部开大会。二十岁的时梅芬在会上介绍她的先进工作经验。时梅芬是冶金设备科的制图员，图画得非常好。这个姑娘也是科里的活跃人物，她除了担任工会组织委员的职务，还上夜大学。她每天都是事先把第二天的工作了解清楚，做个安排，第二天就照着计划做。张凤台听了以后心里想，时梅芬这个办法倒挺好，自己为什么不也作一个计划呢？以后他每天下了班，就记下今天作了些什么、工作中发现什么问题、明天应该解决哪些问题。这样记了一些时候，觉得自己的工作开始有规律了。
    五月，来了一个新任务，绘制倾动机械。张凤台是这个绘图组的负责人。他必须先作出技术设计，小组里其他十几个同志才好帮着作施工设计。当他接到这个任务的时候，心里很着急，能不能在一个月里完成十五张定额呢？这个问题连他自己都回答不出。他画了一年图，一直没个准数，这一次是三天一张，下一次也许是三天半一张，有时候在画中间，大家说笑，画错了擦了重画，这样就拖得更久一点。可是自己不管三七二十一，总是拿三天画一张做标准订计划。想到这里，张凤台好笑起来，这就像一个人天天吃饭，吃了多少年，还不知道自己一顿吃几碗饭一样。测量一下自己到底有多大能耐？结果一试，两天能画一张。以后他就按自己的能力、任务的特点、影响工作的各种因素订作业计划，用“工作日记”总结和检查。
    张凤台有一天在办公室走廊的黑板报上，发现朱介圭写的一篇文章。这篇文章很吸引他，他一口气读完了。朱介圭在文章里讲他自己怎么样在一个月的功夫里画了二十一张设计图。这件事给他很大的刺激。朱介圭和他是同班同学，过去一块儿在东北工学院念书，看人家这一年多进步成什么样子，而自己一个月画十四张图还是勉勉强强的。应该向朱介圭好好学习呵！他一面走一面想。朱介圭讲的不错，除了在画的方法上改进外，工具的准备也很重要。
    有次，科里加班赶制电话分线柜的施工设计图。张凤台不熟悉这个工程，所以早就同小组的葛荣家说好，麻烦葛先把参考图和计划图准备好。真怪，那一天他一口气画了四张像报纸那样大小的图纸。夜里回到宿舍，他坐下来细细回想白天的工作，什么原因使自己一下子画那么多图呢？他回忆起平日工作的忙乱劲儿。常常正画中间，忽然发现要参看参考图才能画下去。到图库去借，得自己在柜子里查卡片，一翻就是半个钟头，有时找了一、二个钟头还找不到，不得不回到办公楼向老同志打听。卡片找到了，资料员最快也要十几分钟才能拿出来，自己还要清点一遍，上百张图纸，数就要数一阵。图由库里出来要经过很多手续，还要开出门证，图库和自己都得盖章。更可怕的是有时找了半天，拿回去的图连一点参考价值都没有。有时候正集中精力画图，铅笔断了，又没有备用的，找小刀削铅笔也要花不少时间。他深刻体会到严肃地对待每一件细小工作的重要。看起来，一把小刀、一张参考图和一个伟大的工程比，不过是一些微不足道的“琐事”，难道不正是有许许多多的设计人员，因为没有认真地做好这些“琐事”，而白白浪费掉不少可贵的时间吗！
    这样，张凤台从工作的教训中总结了这样一条：“严肃地有计划有准备地工作，争取每一分钟时间，是提高工作效率的主要关键！”这不单是一个工作方法，也标志着张凤台的思想觉悟提高了。因为只有全心全意想做好一件工作的人，才能够珍惜时间，有效地把自己的工作全面地组织起来。张凤台自己用行动证明了这一点。现在，在张凤台的“工作日记”里，再也找不到一个月画十几张图的数字了。从去年八月起，他就突破定额不断地创造新纪录，到今年一月，像报纸那样大小的图纸他能够画三十二点九张，质量都是头等的。他一个人作两个人的设计工作。
    如果全国的设计人员都能像张凤台一样，把工作效率提高一倍，那就等于大大加强了我们的设计力量，那就会改变目前设计赶不上施工的状况，那就会加快工业建设的速度！
