    Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions
    A letter from the Jiaozuo Machinery Factory in Henan: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" column on February 19th regarding our factory's neglect of safe production is correct. We have already convened a meeting of relevant responsible cadres and technical personnel and decided to take measures to improve workshop ventilation and prevent worker poisoning accidents, including installing electric ventilation pipes and airlocks on both sides of the copper furnace and increasing the height of the chimney.
    A letter from the Beijing Rubber Factory: We sincerely accept the criticism in the "Reader's Letters" column on February 14th regarding our factory's lack of concern for the health of our employees. In the past, we did not actively improve production management and abused the methods of alternating shifts and staggered shifts, which was a major shortcoming in our work. Now we have taken measures and formulated a comprehensive plan to improve the lives and welfare of our employees to gradually improve this work.
    A letter from readers Bai Yunshan, Wang Tingjun, and Gong Wendian: After the "Reader's Letters" column published our letter "Hurry Up and Repair the Leaky Dormitories" on March 11th, the leadership of the Mudanjiang Railway Sub-bureau has already repaired the leaky dormitories. The employees have expressed their satisfaction.
    A letter from the Jiangxi Pharmaceutical Factory: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" column on February 14th regarding the former Jiangxi Pesticide Factory's (now merged with other factories and renamed Jiangxi Pharmaceutical Factory) mistake of not caring about the lives of the workers is entirely correct. The former Jiangxi Pesticide Factory, in its single-minded pursuit of output, failed to pay attention to improving working conditions, which seriously affected the health of its employees. Although the factory had accumulated a certain amount of enterprise bonus funds, it did not use them well for rewarding rationalization proposals and improving the welfare of employees. Now, we are actively correcting past mistakes, improving working conditions, and carrying out the modification of machinery and equipment.

    批评建议的反应
    河南焦作机械厂来信：二月十九日“读者来信专页”对我厂忽视安全生产的批评是正确的。我们已经召集有关负责干部和技术人员的会议，决定采取在铜炉两侧安装电力通风管和风闸、把烟筒加高等措施来改善车间通风情况，以防止工人中毒事故。
    北京市橡胶厂来信：我们诚恳接受二月十四日“读者来信专页”对我厂不关心职工健康状况的批评。我们过去没有积极地改进生产管理工作，而滥用倒班、错班的办法，这是工作中的一个很大的缺点。现在我们已经采取措施，制定了改善职工生活福利的全面规划，来逐步改进这一工作。
    读者白云山、王廷钧、宫文殿来信：三月十一日“读者来信专页”刊登了我们所写的“赶快修补破漏的宿舍”的来信以后，牡丹江铁路分局领导方面已经对破漏的宿舍进行维修。员工们都表示满意。
    江西制药厂来信：二月十四日“读者来信专页”对前江西农药厂（现在已经和其他厂合并改称江西制药厂）不关心工人生活的错误提出了批评，这是十分正确的。前江西农药厂因为单纯追求产量，不注意改善劳动条件，严重地影响了职工的身体健康。工厂里虽然储备了一定的企业奖励基金，但是没有很好地用到合理化建议的奖励和职工生活福利方面去。现在，我们正积极纠正过去的错误，改善劳动条件，进行机器设备的改装工作。
