The Qiliying Collective Farm Management Committee in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, recently examined the phenomena of extravagance and waste and improved its financial management.

The investigation revealed that out of the more than 109,000 yuan spent by the farm in the two months since its establishment, only about 70% was used to purchase essential means of production. More than 30,000 yuan was spent on items that could have been purchased later or not at all. For example, a large truck was purchased, but because no one could drive it, it sat idle in Xinxiang for more than a month. Despite having iron-wheeled carts, six pairs of rubber tires were bought to replace the iron wheels on the carts. For the sake of "show," thirty feet of satin were purchased to make five silk banners. New cloth curtains were hung completely on the doors, new blue tablecloths were spread on the tables, and bicycles and fine porcelain bowls were also purchased. Even when only a few people were in a meeting at night, gas lamps were lit. A total of 230 lamps were lit in the offices and civil schools every night, resulting in significant waste.

After uncovering these issues, the Management Committee criticized the erroneous views of "showing off" and "it's okay for key cooperatives to spend a little more money." It proposed adhering to the principle of running the cooperative diligently and frugally, and mobilized the teams to discuss the matter. First, it was decided to improve the financial approval system, stipulating that expenditures below 10 yuan would be approved by the head of the finance section, expenditures below 100 yuan would be approved by the farm chairman, and expenditures below 500 yuan would be approved by the standing committee. The financial system should be supervised by the cooperative members, ensuring daily clearance and monthly settlement, and timely disclosure of accounts to the cooperative members.

In terms of administrative expenses, it was decided to implement a financial contract responsibility system. Previously, the twelve production teams used 1,200 sheets of glazed paper per month. After proposing financial contracts, a careful calculation showed that 120 sheets would be sufficient. The oil consumption of each team was also reduced from 270 jin to 112 jin.

The Management Committee also announced that cooperative members who achieved savings within the contract limits would be rewarded.

### 七里营农庄检查铺张浪费现象

    七里营农庄检查铺张浪费现象
    河南省新乡县七里营集体农庄管理委员会，最近检查了铺张浪费现象，改进了财务管理工作。
    经检查发现这个农庄在建庄两个多月来的十万九千多元开支中，除70％左右是买了必需的生产资料以外，有三万多元是买了可以迟买或可以不买的东西，例如：买了一辆大汽车，因为没有人开，在新乡闲了一个多月；有铁轮大车又买来六对胶轮，把大车上的铁轮换上胶轮。为了“排场”，买了三十尺缎子做了五面锦旗；门上完全挂上新布门帘，桌上铺的新蓝桌布，还买了自行车、细瓷碗等。晚上几个人开会也要点汽灯，每天晚上办公室、民校共点灯二百三十盏，形成很大浪费。
    管理委员会在检查出这些情况后，批判了“讲派头”、“重点社多花点钱没啥”的错误观点，提出坚持勤俭办社的方针，发动各队进行了讨论。首先决定改进财务批准制度，规定开支十元以下由财务股长批准，一百元以下由农庄主席批准，开支五百元以下由常委会批准。财务制度要接受庄员监督，做到日清月结，按时向庄员公布账目。
    在行政开支上决定实行财务包干制。原来十二个生产队一个月要用一千二百张油光纸，提出财务包干后，经过细算有一百二十张就够了；各队的用油也由二百七十斤降到一百一十二斤。
    管理委员会还宣布：在包干之内庄员们节约仍有节余者，给以奖励。
