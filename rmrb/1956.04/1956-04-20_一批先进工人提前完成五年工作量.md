    A Batch of Advanced Workers Complete Five Years' Work Ahead of Schedule
    A number of advanced producers from various regions have already completed their individual work quotas for the period of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. These advanced producers are: Ye Zhiming, a youth shock worker from Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory; Wang Suhua, a female garment worker from the local state-owned Shijiazhuang Knitting Factory; Liu Qinggui, a coal miner from Pingxiang Coal Mine; He Changxian, a driver from Hubei Province; and Zhu Daxian, a lathe operator from the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Factory.
    The common characteristics of these advanced producers are their diligent study of the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and China, and their improvement of many production tools and creation of new operation methods in their work. For example, Zhu Daxian has mastered nine advanced lathe tool methods, including the Unanov method, and improved twelve kinds of jigs, fixtures, and operation methods. From 1954 to the present, Wang Suhua has successively improved four parts on the planing machine and seven operation methods. Her daily output of woolen garments has increased from more than thirty dozens in early 1954 to the current 261 dozens.
    These advanced producers also cherish every minute and second of work time, strive to improve work efficiency, and at the same time pay attention to product quality and conservation. Before each coal mining operation, Liu Qinggui first makes all preparations, and does not carelessly discard tools after entering the shift to mine coal, so the utilization rate of his daily work time is above 95%. Since 1953, Ye Zhiming's product quality has consistently met administrative targets. Over the past three years, He Changxian has also saved more than 3,000 liters of gasoline.

    一批先进工人提前完成五年工作量
    各地一批先进生产者已经提前完成了第一个五年计划期间的个人工作量。这些先进生产者是：重庆柴油机厂青年突击手冶金铭、地方国营石家庄针织厂女成衣工王素华、萍乡煤矿采煤工人柳青桂、湖北省汽车司机何昌贤和国营上海机床厂车工朱大仙。
    这些先进生产者的共同特点就是认真地学习苏联和我国的先进经验，在工作中改进了许多生产工具和创造新的操作方法。例如朱大仙已经掌握了乌纳诺夫等九种先进的车刀法，改进了十二种工夹具和操作方法。王素华从1954年到现在，先后改进了刨缝机上的四个零件和七种操作方法。她的绒衣日产量由1954年初的三十多打提高到现在的261打。
    这些先进生产者还珍惜一分一秒的工作时间，努力提高工作效率，同时又注意到产品的质量和节约。柳青桂在每次采煤以前，首先做好一切准备，进班采煤以后不乱丢工具，因此他每天的工作时间的利用率都在95％以上。冶金铭从1953年到现在产品质量都达到了行政指标。何昌贤三年多来还节约了汽油三千多公升。
