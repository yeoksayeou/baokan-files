Sichuan and Guizhou farmers in various areas have recently actively carried out water storage and conservation and drought prevention and resistance work. In Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, more than 2,500 agricultural production cooperatives have universally formulated water management methods that fix personnel, water, fields, and work points, enabling the county's 370,000 mu of paddy fields to be fully planted.

In some drought-stricken areas of Guizhou Province, intense drought resistance activities have been launched. The Yunfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anshun County has invested all its efforts into drought resistance work. All 150 dragon-bone waterwheels in the cooperative are operating day and night, irrigating more than 600 mu of water-deficient fields to a depth of three to four inches. Members of the Shuiya Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qinglong County carried more than 5,000 loads of water in five days, turning the yellow corn seedlings into green.

    四川贵州农民积极抗旱
    四川、贵州省各地农民最近积极开展了蓄水保水和防旱抗旱工作。四川省南部县二千五百多个农业生产合作社普遍制定了定人、定水、定田和定工分的管水办法，使全县三十七万亩稻田可以满栽满插。

    贵州省部分干旱地区展开了紧张的抗旱活动。安顺县云峰农业生产合作社将全部力量投入了抗旱工作，社内一百五十架龙骨水车日夜不停地开动着，使六百多亩缺水的田灌上了三、四寸深的水。晴隆县水鸭农业生产合作社的社员，五天中挑水五千多挑，使缺水的玉米苗由黄转青。
