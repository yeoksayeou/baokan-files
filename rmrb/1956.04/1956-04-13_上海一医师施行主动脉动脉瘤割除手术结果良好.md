    The bargeman worker Song Kunxiang, who underwent aortic aneurysm removal surgery at Shanghai Second Medical College Affiliated Hongren Hospital, was discharged from the hospital on the 11th, fully recovered.

    Professor Lan Xichun, the doctor who performed the surgery on Song Kunxiang, told reporters that very few aortic aneurysm patients in other countries have received surgical removal treatment.

    Song Kunxiang's aneurysm was located on the ascending aorta, less than an inch from the heart. This location is the main gateway for blood circulation. His tumor was rapidly expanding and he already had symptoms of coughing up blood. If the tumor continued to expand, the wall of the blood vessel would become thinner, and there would be a possibility of rupture.

    The teachers of the Clinical Surgery Teaching and Research Group of Shanghai Second Medical College discussed the treatment of this disease with Soviet surgical experts who visited Shanghai last December and obtained the latest Soviet information. Lan Xichun, the director of the Teaching and Research Group, and lecturer Feng Zhuorong studied the literature written by Soviet surgical expert Academician Bakulev and also trial-produced special forceps necessary for the surgery. On February 29th, they performed this advanced surgery for the first time to replace the past palliative treatment, removing the life-threatening tumor from Song Kunxiang.

    上海一医师施行主动脉动脉瘤割除手术结果良好
    在上海第二医学院附属宏仁医院割除主动脉动脉瘤的驳船工人宋昆祥在十一日已痊愈出院。
    为宋昆祥施手术的医师兰锡纯教授对记者说：各国主动脉动脉瘤患者接受割除手术治疗的还极少。
    宋昆祥的动脉瘤生在离开心脏不到一寸的升主动脉上。这个地方是血液循环的总关口。而他的瘤肿迅速扩大，已经有了咳血症状。如果这个瘤肿再扩张下去，血管的壁更薄了，就有破裂的可能。
    上海第二医学院临床外科学教研组的教师们在去年十二月曾同来上海访问的苏联外科专家讨论过这种疾病的治疗问题，并且获得了苏联的最新资料。教研组主任兰锡纯和讲师冯卓荣研究了苏联外科专家巴库列夫院士所写的文献，同时试制了在手术上必需用的特殊钳子。二月二十九日，他们第一次采用这种先进手术来代替过去的姑息疗法，为宋昆祥割去了这个威胁生命的瘤肿。
