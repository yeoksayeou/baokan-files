Shanghai News Briefs

    ★ Shanghai's state-owned Dafu and the joint state-private Zhengtai, along with two other rubber factories, will supply 450,000 pairs of new specification rubber shoes to various parts of the country in April. These shoes are characterized by wider and larger lasts, and the thickness at the heel is increased by one centimeter compared to the old specifications, making them more comfortable and durable.
    ★ Many of China's famous dishes, snacks, and fruits will be made into canned food this year. Shanghai's six major canned food factories have already produced twenty-five kinds in the first quarter, and are preparing to trial-produce more than one hundred others.
    ★ State-owned and joint state-private factories in Shanghai have established more than 300 Communist Youth League supervision posts since the second quarter of 1955. These supervision posts have played a significant role in consolidating labor discipline and urging enterprises to improve management.
    ★ Thirty-eight senior technicians formerly belonging to Shanghai's industrial departments have successively gone to Beijing, Lanzhou and other places to participate in the country's key construction projects. Among these senior technicians, five are private individuals from joint state-private factories, and they are very happy to have the opportunity to participate in the country's key construction projects.
