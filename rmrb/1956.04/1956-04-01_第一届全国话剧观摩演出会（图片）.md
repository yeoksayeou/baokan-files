The First National Drama Festival

The First National Drama Festival, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, has been held simultaneously in four theaters in the capital since March 1st. Drama troupes from all over the country have continuously performed forty-nine dramas of different themes and styles, which have been warmly welcomed by Chinese and foreign audiences in Beijing. This festival demonstrates the healthy development of China's multi-ethnic drama undertaking under the leadership of the Communist Party of China; it powerfully confirms the correctness of the Party's literary and artistic policy. We wish our drama undertaking will become increasingly prosperous and flourish.

	Thousands of Rivers and Mountains (Performed and contributed by the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army) This drama depicts the revolutionary history of the 25,000-li Long March. The script creates heroic images such as Li Youguo, a political instructor of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.

	Methane Gas Problem (i.e., "Glorious Post," performed by the Shenyang Drama Troupe) This drama shows the ideological struggle between two different approaches to production and worker safety.

	Along the Yangtze River (i.e., "The Second Liberation," performed by the Wuhan People's Art Theater Drama Troupe) This drama reflects the different attitudes of two leaders towards new things in the process of production reform in a locomotive and rolling stock repair factory.

	You Must Not Take That Path (Performed by the Henan Provincial Drama Troupe) This drama is adapted from a novella by Li Zhun. The play criticizes the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some peasants.

	Family Affairs (Jointly performed by the Heilongjiang Provincial Drama Troupe and the Harbin Municipal Drama Troupe) This drama criticizes the idea of underestimating the work of trade unions in relation to the families of workers.

	Friendship (i.e., "Homeland's Garden," performed by the China Welfare Institute Children's Art Theater) Through different characters such as Young Pioneers Li Xiaohui, Zhao Dawei, Li Bingliang, and Du Qiang, the script portrays the Party's education of the new generation and sings the praises of the unity and friendship of the Young Pioneers.

	We Are All Sentries (Mongolian language, performed by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Song and Dance Troupe) This drama depicts the struggle of the people of the Xilin Gol grasslands in Inner Mongolia against special agents.

	A Happy Event (Uyghur language, performed by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Drama Troupe) This drama is a work by a writer from a fraternal ethnic group. The play reflects the issue of agricultural cooperativization in fraternal ethnic regions, and depicts new figures such as Party branch secretary Reyimu Hade and young agronomist Abudoukelimu.

	In recent years, under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic policy, drama actors have strengthened their artistic cultivation and worked hard in artistic practice, successfully creating realistic images of people of the times.
