The twenty-first session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council is scheduled to be held on April 17. The meeting is prepared to discuss the issue of "forced labor." According to a report on the "issue of forced labor" jointly compiled by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Director-General of the International Labour Office, which was recently published by the Economic and Social Council, it can be seen that some people intend to launch a smear campaign against peaceful and democratic countries, especially the People's Republic of China, at this meeting. This activity is not only an insult to the people of China and other peaceful and democratic countries, but also violates the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and damages the dignity of the Economic and Social Council and the United Nations organization.

The "reports" and "memoranda" related to the People's Republic of China contained within the report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Director-General of the International Labour Office were submitted to the United Nations by the US government, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and so-called international organizations such as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Therefore, it is not surprising that these materials are full of lies and slander. The intention behind the United States' blatant actions is self-evident.

For years, the United States has continuously slandered our country for practicing "forced labor." One of the main bases for the US propaganda machine to carry out this slander in the past was our country's policy of reforming criminals through labor. The methods they relied on were the distortion of our government's laws and decrees and the fabrication of non-existent facts. Anyone who is unbiased and clear-headed can understand that our policy of reforming criminals through labor is not merely limited to keeping criminals in custody, but more importantly, organizing them to engage in labor production during their custody, while also providing them with cultural education and vocational skills training, so that they can transform into new people useful to society. This is beneficial to both the entire society and the criminals themselves. Many people who have come to our country to visit our labor reform institutions have expressed satisfaction and praise for our work in reforming criminals through labor, considering it a most humane policy. Mr. Batchelor, the deputy leader of the British trade union delegation who visited our country, said that insults to prisoners had been completely abolished in Chinese prisons, and that prisoners could not only see many good books and newspapers, but also operate machines and learn technology; from this point of view, Chinese prisons are truly for reforming criminals. Argentine lawyer Birgin also said after visiting that he is a lawyer and is very familiar with prisons in capitalist countries, where there is punishment and brutal behavior everywhere; in China, the principle of reforming prisoners through labor is adopted, and prisoners do not suffer any mental pain. These fair remarks shattered the lies of the United States. It is no accident that the United States' attempts to slander our country in several sessions of the Economic and Social Council have been met with indifference by representatives of other member states.

However, the United States refuses to give up its bankrupt trick, and believes that expanding the scope of rumors and increasing the breadth of slander can achieve the purpose of deceiving people. They even talk nonsense, saying that almost every worker's labor in China is carried out under coercion. They even describe the people's enthusiastic labor in national construction and the workers' production competitions as "forced labor." The Chinese people can only express the utmost contempt for this slander.

Everyone knows that the Chinese people have established their own country and become the masters of their own land. Labor has become a glorious and pleasant thing for every citizen with the ability to work. They enjoy the fruits of their labor and have obtained reliable guarantees in terms of social security, reasonable work, medical treatment, and cultural education. Therefore, everyone has abundant enthusiasm for labor. This is visible to every foreigner who has come to New China. Mrs. Uma Nehru, a member of the Indian Parliament, said when talking about her impressions after visiting China that the Chinese people she saw were so happy. She visited workers, farmers, and people from all walks of life, and wherever she went, she found a sense of satisfaction. China is a country full of warmth. Obviously, in a country where the people are the masters, in a people's democratic system led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, there is absolutely no need for and absolutely no possibility of the existence of any "forced labor" system. "Forced labor" can only exist in capitalist countries like the United States, which implement an economic system of exploitation of man by man, where workers are deprived of the means of production and are subjected to the exploitation and enslavement of monopoly capitalists, and do not enjoy the fruits of their labor. For example, a report submitted to the United Nations by the American League for the Defense of Labor many years ago made a convincing exposure of this. It listed various forms of "forced labor" practiced in the United States: debt peonage, encouraging illegal immigration to exploit foreign workers, exploiting the labor of convicts sentenced to hard labor, exploiting people detained in mental hospitals, exploiting foreign workers and conscientious objectors during the war, exploiting certain Indian tribes, and using strike-breaking laws to infringe and restrict the rights of trade unions. The above-mentioned situation is enough to show that "forced labor" is widely practiced in the United States.

The United States' intensified slander campaign against the People's Republic of China at this time is not only to divert people's attention and cover up its own cruel system of slave labor, but also contains another purpose. The US ruling group cannot hide from the eyes and ears of the people of all countries, so that they cannot see the flourishing phenomenon of the People's Republic of China, and so that they are not attracted by the great picture of the Chinese people carrying out peaceful construction. Therefore, they are whimsically attempting to use the slanderous propaganda of so-called "forced labor" to devalue our country's prestige and influence, especially to try to stop the increasingly loud movement of the world's people demanding the restoration of our country's legitimate status in the United Nations. The US ruling group's futile actions are clearly a waste of effort.

The United Nations must not be used by the United States as a place for slander. The Chinese people have every right to demand that the Economic and Social Council and other United Nations bodies withdraw the discussion of this so-called "forced labor" issue.

### 斥关于所谓“强迫劳动”的诽谤

    斥关于所谓“强迫劳动”的诽谤
    联合国经济及社会理事会第二十一届会议定四月十七日举行。会议准备讨论“强迫劳动”的问题。根据经社理事会不久以前发表的一份由联合国秘书长和国际劳工局局长联合编纂的关于“强迫劳动问题”的报告，人们可以知道，有人打算在这一次会议上对和平民主国家，特别是对中华人民共和国发动一个诬蔑运动。这一勾当，不仅是对中国人民和其他和平民主国家人民的一种侮辱，而且违背了联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，有损于经社理事会和联合国组织的尊严。
    联合国秘书长和国际劳工局局长的报告书中有关中华人民共和国的部分所载的“报告”和“备忘录”，都是由美国政府、蒋介石集团和国际自由工会联合会等一类的所谓国际组织向联合国提出的。因此，一点也不奇怪，这些材料是充满着谎言和诽谤。美国这样露骨的作法，其用心是不言而喻的。
    几年以来，美国不断地诬蔑我国实行“强迫劳动”。美国造谣机器过去进行这种诽谤的一个主要根据就是我国对罪犯进行劳动改造的政策，它们所依靠的手段是对我国政府法令文告的歪曲以及凭空捏造根本不存在的事实。任何一个没有成见而头脑清醒的人都可以理解，我们对罪犯的劳动改造政策不仅仅是限于把犯罪分子监管起来，而更重要的是在监管期间组织他们从事劳动生产，同时并对他们进行文化教育和生产技能的训练，使他们能够转变成为对社会有用的新人。这是对于整个社会和罪犯本人都有好处的。许多曾经到我国来参观过我国劳动改造机关的人士，都对我国劳动改造罪犯的工作表示满意和赞扬，认为是一种最人道的政策。曾来我国访问参观的英国工会代表团副团长巴契勒尔就说过在我国监狱里已完全废除了对犯人的侮辱，犯人们不但能看到很多内容很好的书报，而且还可以开机器，学技术；从这点看，中国的监狱是真正为了改造罪犯。阿根廷律师比尔金参观后也说，他是一个律师，对资本主义国家监狱很熟悉，在那里，到处都是惩罚和粗暴的行为；在中国则是采用通过劳动改造犯人的原则，犯人没有任何精神上的痛苦。这些公正的言论粉碎了美国的谎言。美国在经社理事会上几届会议中对我国进行诬蔑的企图遭到其他理事国代表的冷淡，并不是偶然的。
    但是美国却不肯放弃已经破了产的勾当，而且自以为扩大造谣的范围、增加诽谤的广度就能够达到骗人的目的。他们竟然信口雌黄地说，在中国几乎每一个劳动者的劳动都是在强迫之下进行的。甚至把人民对祖国建设的热情劳动、工人展开生产竞赛，也说成是“强迫劳动”。中国人民对于这种诬蔑只能表示最大的轻蔑。
    谁都知道，中国人民建立了自己的国家，当了自己土地的主人。劳动对于每一个有劳动能力的公民都已成为光荣而愉快的事情。他们享受着自己的劳动果实，在社会安全、合理工作、医药治疗和文化教育各方面都获得了可靠的保证，因此大家都有着充沛的劳动热情。这是每一个到过新中国来的外国人士都看得见的。印度国会议员乌玛·尼赫鲁夫人访问中国后谈到她的观感时说，她看到的中国人民都是那么愉快。她访问过工人，也访问过农民和各阶层的人民，无论走到那里，她都发现满意的情绪，中国是一个充满温暖的国家。很显然，在一个人民自己当家作主的国家里，在一个以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度中，是绝对不需要也绝对不可能存在任何“强迫劳动”的制度的。“强迫劳动”只能存在于实行人剥削人的经济制度的像美国那样的资本主义国家中，在那里劳动者被剥夺了生产工具和生产手段，遭受到垄断资本家的剥削和奴役，而享受不到自己的劳动成果。例如：美国“保卫工人联盟”多年以前就曾经向联合国提出的一份报告书对此作过令人信服的揭露。其中列举了在美国实行的各式各样的“强迫劳动”：债务农奴制、鼓励非法移民来剥削外国工人、剥削罚作苦工的罪犯的劳动、剥削拘留在精神病院的人们、战争期间剥削外国工人和因良心而反对战争者、剥削某些印地安部落以及用破坏罢工法律来侵犯和限制工会的权利。以上所揭露的情况，就足以说明在美国才是广泛地实行着“强迫劳动”。
    美国在今天这个时候变本加厉地进行对中华人民共和国的这种诽谤活动，不仅仅是为了要转移人们的注意，掩饰它自己的残酷的奴隶劳动制度，而且还包含着另外一种目的。美国统治集团无法掩盖各国人民的耳目，使他们看不见中华人民共和国欣欣向荣的现象，使他们不被中国人民进行和平建设的伟大图景所吸引，因此就异想天开企图拿所谓“强迫劳动”的诬蔑宣传来贬损我国的威信和影响，特别是想要借此阻挡世界人民要求恢复我国在联合国中合法地位的日益高涨的运动。美国统治集团这种心劳日拙的行径显然是白费心机的。
    联合国绝不能被美国利用作为进行诽谤的场所。中国人民完全有权利要求经社理事会和联合国其他机构撤销这一所谓“强迫劳动”问题的讨论。
