    The newly built state-owned Zhengzhou Meat Joint Processing Plant officially went into production on the 2nd.
    This factory can process a large, fat pig in an average of less than one minute. In the factory, workers do not need to exert heavy physical labor; even the pig hair scraping is done by machine. Each pig undergoes various sanitary inspections before and after slaughter, and if a virus is detected, it is immediately handled separately.
    The pork, oils, sausage casings, pig bristles, blood meal, bone meal, and other finished or semi-finished products processed by this plant will be exported in large quantities, with a portion supplied to the domestic market. (Xinhua News Agency)

    郑州肉类联合加工厂投入生产
    新建的国营郑州肉类联合加工厂，二日正式投入生产。
    这个工厂平均不到一分钟就能将一头大肥猪加工完毕。在工厂里，工人们不需要付出很重的体力劳动，连刮猪毛的工作也是用机器进行的。每只猪在屠宰前后都有卫生人员作各种检验，如果发现病毒，就立刻另作处理。
    经这个厂加工的猪肉、油脂、肠衣、猪鬃、血粉、骨粉等成品或半成品，将大量出口，部分供应国内市场。（新华社）
