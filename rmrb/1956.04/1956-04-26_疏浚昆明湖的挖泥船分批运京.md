The "Beijing" combined electric suction dredger, designed and rebuilt by the Dredging Company of the Navigation Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, began to be shipped from Tianjin to Beijing in batches on the 18th, and will soon participate in this year's dredging project of Kunming Lake.

This is a large 800-horsepower dredger capable of dredging approximately 300 cubic meters of mud per hour. Its hull is constructed of eleven electrically welded, watertight pontoons bolted together. The characteristics of this dredger are: easy to disassemble and assemble, with disassembly and assembly man-hours and costs only equal to 30% of those required by ordinary dredgers; at the same time, it is easy to transport. After disassembly, it can be transported by just twelve 30-ton railway cars or twenty 20-ton tractor-trailers. Each pontoon of this dredger can also float independently, so it can also be towed by tugboats in the water.

    疏浚昆明湖的挖泥船分批运京
    交通部航务工程总局疏浚公司设计和改建的“北京号”组合式电动绞吸挖泥船，已经在十八日开始从天津分批装运北京，即将参加昆明湖今年的疏浚工程。
    这是一艘八百马力的大型挖泥船，每小时能够挖泥约三百立方公尺，它的船体是由十一个电焊结构的水密浮箱用螺丝栓结合起来的。这艘挖泥船的特点是：便于拆装，所需拆装工时和费用只等于普通挖泥船所需的30％；同时又便于运输，在它解体以后，只要用十二个三十吨车皮或二十辆二十吨的牵引拖车，就可以运走。这艘挖泥船的每一浮箱还能独立漂浮，因此也可以在水中用拖轮拖带。
