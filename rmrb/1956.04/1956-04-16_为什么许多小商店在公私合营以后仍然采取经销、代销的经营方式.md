    Why Do Many Small Shops Still Adopt Distribution and Agency Sales After Public-Private Partnership?
    Many readers have written to inquire: Why do many small shops (generally called husband-and-wife stores or family-run shops) still adopt distribution and agency sales after public-private partnership?
    Now, we answer this question as follows:
    The socialist transformation of private commerce must adopt different steps and methods according to the different situations, original characteristics, and development prospects of various types of commerce. Only in this way can it be convenient for leadership and management, avoid various chaotic phenomena, and preserve and promote all the good experiences in the original business methods of various businesses, so that they can better serve the people.
    What are the characteristics of family-run shops? This can be divided into two aspects. On the one hand, general family-run shops are very small in scale, with no separation between home and shop; their funds are very limited, only a few hundred yuan or even dozens of yuan, and it is difficult to distinguish between the shop's means of production and the shop owner's household appliances; they generally do not employ workers or only employ individual workers, and the shop owner's whole family participates in labor, engaging in business and taking care of housework; the shop's accounts are very unsound, and the accounting methods of each household are very inconsistent. On the other hand, general family-run shops have close ties with residents, which is very convenient for residents to purchase daily necessities: husband-and-wife stores are widely distributed, and can be found on streets and alleys; they operate in many varieties of goods, some of which are small items that state-owned companies do not operate but residents need; the business methods are very flexible, selling even a single cigarette or a needle, and selling goods from early morning to late night, and even selling on credit to familiar customers.
    According to the above two aspects of characteristics, general family-run shops should not adopt the same steps and methods as other public-private joint ventures after public-private partnership. Because it is difficult to calculate the assessment of assets and fixed interest and the implementation of fixed wages in the case of no separation between home and shop, and fixed working hours, fixed purchasing and sales procedures, and the establishment of sound accounting books are also not possible for husband-and-wife stores; more importantly, doing so can easily make family-run shops lose their original characteristics of making residents feel convenient, and it will also cause some chaotic phenomena in operation. Allowing family-run shops to continue to implement distribution and agency sales after public-private partnership can enable them to continue to play their original role and help them further improve their business level and better serve residents. Therefore, this is a more appropriate method.
    Because there are many industries in commerce and the situations are different, some industries have higher commodity values and require more funds, and the small-scale operation of husband-and-wife stores is difficult to meet the needs of consumers; in some industries, the number of family-run shops is very small, and most of the shops in the same industry have already fixed shares and fixed interest. For husband-and-wife stores in these industries, the same transformation form as other stores can also be adopted, with appropriate arrangements. Of course, this type of family-run shop accounts for a smaller proportion of the total number of family-run shops.
    Distribution and agency sales after full industry joint venture is a form of public-private partnership. Because its source of goods is mainly supplied by the state, the purchase and sales plan is approved by the state, and the handling fee is similar to the piece-rate wage system in socialist enterprises. Under the principle of overall planning in the entire industry, the business of family-run shops implementing distribution and agency sales can be properly arranged, and the lives of shop owners are also guaranteed. These husband-and-wife stores will also be organized into mutual aid groups by region and industry under the leadership of professional companies or their district management offices to carry out political education and gradually develop welfare undertakings. In the future, with the development of national construction, the existing husband-and-wife stores will gradually be further transformed, and finally become various types of state-owned small shops, and the employees will also gradually be transformed into employees of state commerce. Therefore, some employees of family-run shops believe that "distribution and agency sales are not as good as public-private partnership" and "family-run shops have no future." This idea is incorrect. They should improve their enthusiasm for business, carry forward their original characteristics, and strive to improve their work to meet the requirements of the vast number of consumers.

### 为什么许多小商店在公私合营以后仍然采取经销、代销的经营方式

    为什么许多小商店在公私合营以后仍然采取经销、代销的经营方式
    不少读者来信询问：为什么许多小商店（一般叫做夫妻店或者连家铺）在公私合营以后，仍然要采取经销、代销的经营方式？
    现在，我们对这个问题答复如下：
    对私营商业进行社会主义改造，必须根据各种类型的商业的不同情况、原有特点和发展前途，采取不同的步骤和方法。只有这样，才能便于领导和管理，避免各种混乱现象，并且保存和发扬各种商业原有经营方式中的一切好的经验，使他们更好地为人民服务。
    连家铺的特点是什么呢？这可以分两方面来说。一方面，一般连家铺规模很小，家店不分；他们的资金很少，只有几百元甚至几十元，而且店里的生产资料和店主的家庭用具很难分清；他们一般不雇用职工或只雇用个别职工，店主一家老少参加劳动，既从事营业，又兼管家务；店里的账目很不健全，而各户的记账方式又极不一致。另一方面，一般连家铺同居民联系很密切，对居民购买日常用品十分方便：夫妻店分布广泛，大街小巷都有；经营的商品品种很多，其中有一些是目前国营公司不经营而居民又需要的零星商品；营业方式很灵活，一支烟、一根针都可以零卖，从清早到夜晚都可以卖东西，对熟悉的顾客还可以赊销。
    根据上述两方面的特点，一般的连家铺在公私合营以后就不宜于同其他公私合营商店采取一样的步骤和方法。因为，清产定息和实行固定工资在家店不分的情况下都比较难于计算，固定作息时间、固定进销货手续和建立健全的会计账目也不是夫妻店条件所能做到的；更主要的是，这样做容易使连家铺丧失原有的使居民感到方便的特点，并且在经营中还会引起一些混乱现象。让连家铺在公私合营以后仍然实行经销代销，就可以使他们继续发挥原有的作用，并且帮助他们进一步提高经营水平，更好地为居民服务。因此，这是一种比较适当的办法。
    由于商业中行业很多，情况不一，有些行业商品价值较大，所需资金较多，夫妻店的小规模经营难于满足消费者的需要；有些行业中连家铺的数量很小，同行业中绝大部分商店都已经定股定息了。对于这些行业中的夫妻店，也可以同其他商店采取一样的改造形式，而加以适当的安排。当然，这一类的连家铺在连家铺的总数中所占比重是较少的。
    在全业合营以后的经销代销，就是公私合营的一种形式。因为，它的货源主要是由国家供应的，进销货计划是国家批准的，而手续费又类似社会主义企业中的计件工资制度。实行经销代销的连家铺，在全行业统筹的原则下，营业可以得到适当的安排，店主的生活也得到了应有的保障。这些夫妻店还将在专业公司或它的区管理处的领导下，按地区、按行业组织互助小组，来进行政治教育和逐步举办福利事业等工作。在以后，随着国家建设事业的发展，现有的夫妻店将逐步得到进一步的改造，而最后成为各种类型的国营小商店，从业人员也将逐步改变为国家商业的工作人员。因此，有些连家铺的从业人员认为“经销代销不如公私合营”“连家铺没有前途”，这种想法是不正确的。他们应该提高经营积极性，发扬原有特点，努力改进工作，以适应广大消费者的要求。
