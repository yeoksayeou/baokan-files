    Helping Backward Workers Catch Up with Advanced Workers Based on Different Circumstances
    A Large Increase in Advanced Producers at Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory
    Advanced producers at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory now account for 78.5% of all workers, an increase of 35% compared to February.

    Many newly emerging advanced producers were workers who could not meet their quotas a month ago. The factory's CCP Committee found in its classification and ranking that 70% of workers who failed to meet their quotas were due to backward technology, 25% were due to ideological problems, and 5% were affected in their production enthusiasm due to family financial difficulties and other reasons. The factory leadership took different measures to help them based on these reasons. As a result, many backward workers quickly completed their production quotas and caught up with advanced producers. After the second processing workshop organized more than two hundred workers to visit and observe five types of advanced experiences from advanced producers, the number of workers who failed to complete their quotas decreased from seventeen in February to four.

    When helping backward workers, the factory also organized Party members, Youth League members, and activists to "assign special personnel to be responsible and contract tasks" based on their ideological conditions to provide individual assistance. Because Hu Weiliang, a young worker in the first processing workshop, often quarreled with his wife, he was constantly asking for leave or arriving late, and could not complete his quota. The secretary of the Youth League branch went to his home to help eliminate the estrangement between husband and wife, and Hu Weiliang quickly reached his quota. Wang Peisheng, a worker who was originally backward in production, also immediately changed his work attitude and even received a bonus after Party member Han Wenlian helped solve his family's financial difficulties.

    分别不同情况具体帮助落后工人赶上先进
    太原矿山机器厂先进生产者大量增加
    太原矿山机器厂的先进生产者已经占全体工人的78.5％，比二月份增加了35％。
    许多新涌现的先进生产者在一个月以前还是达不到定额的工人。这个厂的中共党委会在分类排队中发现：达不到定额的工人中70％是因为技术落后，25％是因为有思想问题，5％因为家庭经济困难和其它原因，使生产情绪受了影响。工厂领导方面针对这些原因，采取了不同的办法来帮助他们，结果很多落后工人迅速完成生产定额，赶上了先进生产者。第二加工车间组织二百多个工人分别参观了先进生产者的五种先进经验表演以后，完不成定额的工人就由二月份的十七个减到四个。
    这个厂在帮助落后工人的时候，还根据他们的思想情况分别组织党员、团员和积极分子“专人负责、分工包干”，进行个别的帮助。第一加工车间青年工人胡维亮因经常和爱人闹口角，不断请假或迟到，完不成定额，团支部书记便到他家里帮助消除了夫妻间的隔阂，胡维亮便很快达到了定额。原来在生产上落后的工人王培胜，也在党员韩文廉帮助解决家庭生活困难以后，立即转变了劳动态度，还获得了超额奖金。（新华社）
