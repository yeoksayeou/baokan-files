    Cautiously Transform Urban Small Shops

    In the socialist transformation of private commerce, the economic reorganization of urban small shops is a very important matter and must be carried out actively and steadily.

    Small shops are particularly developed in our country. The number of small shops accounts for about 70% of the total number of seated merchants in large cities, and an even greater proportion in small and medium-sized cities. The turnover of small shops is also very large, especially in industries closely related to the daily lives of residents, such as general merchandise, groceries, tobacco, alcohol, food, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and the catering industry, where the turnover of small shops accounts for about one-third to one-half of the total turnover. The characteristics of small shops are: wide distribution, close to residents; sales of very small quantities of goods, with no fixed business hours; generally having relatively fixed customers, and being able to provide credit and delivery to familiar consumers; many small shops rely on auxiliary family labor. The transformation of small shops should be treated differently according to the characteristics of the goods they handle and their different roles in commodity circulation. On the one hand, attention should be paid to maintaining their livelihoods and business operations through overall planning and giving play to their business enthusiasm; on the other hand, attention should be paid to strengthening their education and management, preventing and overcoming their speculative behavior. On the one hand, attention should be paid to transforming them politically and economically; on the other hand, attention should be paid to continuing to maintain the advantages of small shops in facilitating consumers.

    A small number of small shops can be appropriately merged or concentrated. The goods sold by these small shops are generally not goods needed by the people on a daily basis. Some of them deal in means of production, such as medical equipment, printing materials, and electrical materials; some deal in living materials that are not needed by the people every day, such as cultural and educational supplies, musical instruments, clocks, and glasses. Although a few commodities, such as silk fabrics and Western medicine, are closely related to people's lives, they are suitable for opening larger stores in order to prepare a complete range of colors and varieties of goods, making it convenient for buyers to choose. These stores can also be appropriately merged and concentrated. There are two ways to merge and concentrate: one is to merge small shops into larger joint state-private enterprises, and the other is to merge several small shops to form joint state-private enterprise stores or cooperative stores. All small shops that have been merged or concentrated should have fixed shares and fixed interest, independent accounting, and gradually implement a piece-rate wage system.

    Although there are many industries where small shops can be appropriately merged or concentrated, the number of households is not large. Among small shops, the largest number of households are in the daily necessities, groceries, food, oil, salt, soy sauce, cigarettes, and other industries, which are the most widely distributed, have the closest contact with residents, and are mutually overlapping. Except for individual cases, these small shops are generally not suitable for merging or concentration. Some places have merged and concentrated some of these small shops, which has resulted in great inconvenience to residents. Some of them have been re-dispersed, and some are brewing to be dispersed. For this type of small shop, the transformation should be carried out through the form of distribution and consignment sales, or mostly distribution and consignment sales and a small part self-operated (directly purchasing from handicraftsmen and farmers' markets); allowing them to obtain a price difference or handling fee equivalent to wages through distribution and consignment sales. Their shelves, counters, and tables are still privately owned, and they should use the income from distribution differences and consignment handling fees to purchase and repair them themselves, which is more economical in use and can reduce a large amount of state investment. This form of distribution and consignment sales is a form of joint state-private ownership, so it should still be branded as joint state-private ownership. Some places have implemented a fixed share and fixed interest method in this type of small shop, and have issued fixed wages to the employees of the small shop. These practices are inappropriate and should be changed to distribution and consignment sales. Some places have organized them into cooperative stores. If they are still operating in a decentralized manner and are responsible for their own profits and losses, it can also be considered to change them to distribution and consignment sales.

    There are many small shops in the catering industry, such as noodle shops and small restaurants. In Beijing, their turnover accounts for about one-third of the city's catering industry turnover. Because the goods are processed by themselves, they cannot be consigned for sale. Some of the more concentrated ones can be merged into joint state-private enterprises and implement fixed shares and fixed interest; they can also be organized into cooperative canteens. However, a considerable part of these shops cannot be merged, because their decentralized operation is very convenient for residents, so they can only be self-operated under the management of state-owned specialized companies. State-owned specialized companies should strengthen their management in the following aspects, that is, according to the specific situation, while ensuring that the original advantages are not hindered, determine the turnover, allocate goods, stipulate price and quality standards, and stipulate hygiene conditions in a differentiated rather than formulaic manner. This form of self-operation under the management of state-owned specialized companies will have to be maintained for a considerable period of time in small shops in the catering industry.

    In addition to the small shops that are merged, implement fixed shares and fixed interest joint state-private ownership or organize cooperative stores, they should be organized into mutual aid groups by region and by industry, led by specialized companies or their district management offices with special personnel. The work of these mutual aid groups should be: conducting political education; mutual assistance in purchasing goods (not completely unified purchasing, but for the purpose of regulating labor and conducting mutual assistance); gradually running welfare undertakings to subsidize the needs of employees for birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability; and cooperating with state-owned companies in supervision and management.

    The above methods are generally applicable to large and medium-sized cities. As for small cities with a population of less than 40,000 to 50,000, the situation is different from that of large and medium-sized cities. The characteristics of small cities are: small area, short streets, only one or two bustling streets, mostly at intersections and near markets. The business of shops mainly relies on farmers entering the city to purchase goods, rather than on residents of the city. In the scattered residential areas of small cities, there are very few shops due to low purchasing power, and most of them are peddlers. Therefore, in small cities, the conditions for merging and concentrating small shops are better than in large and medium-sized cities. For small shops concentrated on the main streets and bustling markets in small cities, it can generally be considered to adopt the method of merging shops, joint state-private ownership, or organizing cooperative stores to merge them into larger stores. Some stores in different industries can also be merged as long as the types of goods they operate are similar (such as tobacco and alcohol). In addition, there are still some small shops that are not suitable for merging and concentration due to decentralized supply to local residents. Like large and medium-sized cities, they can adopt the method of consignment sales or mostly consignment sales and a small part of self-operation. Due to the development of the rural commercial network, some industries in small cities used to rely on purchasing goods in the countryside or supplying goods to the countryside, which has now become difficult. For these industries in difficulty, the supply and marketing cooperatives should uniformly arrange them under the unified leadership of the local party and government in conjunction with the adjustment of the urban and rural commercial networks. Some of these people can go to market towns and villages below the county level to be small vendors, and also engage in a part of the agency purchase and sales business.

    To correctly select the transformation form for urban small shops, it is necessary to pay great attention to the investigation and research of the actual situation, and at all times consider preserving and promoting all the original good experiences, facilitating people's purchases, and meeting people's needs in the process of economic reorganization. All viewpoints that only consider the convenience of business management in commercial departments and ignore the quality of business and people's needs are wrong. All viewpoints that only start from concepts and not from reality, thinking that "merging and concentration" is necessarily better than "decentralized operation"; and that "unified calculation of profits and losses" is necessarily better than "decentralized calculation of profits and losses" are also wrong. The economic reorganization of urban small shops is a very complex and meticulous task. A certain transformation form, a certain organizational form, and a certain management system must be adapted to a certain economic situation. It must be ensured that the small shops after transformation and economic reorganization serve the people more thoughtfully, sell more complete goods, and have better quality of goods. Only in this way can the superiority of the socialist economy be truly demonstrated.

    慎重地改造城市小商店
    在对私营商业进行社会主义改造的时候，城市小商店的经济改组工作是一个很重大的事情，必须积极地稳步地进行。
    我国的小商店特别发达。小商店的户数，在大城市中约占座商总户数的70％，在中小城市所占的比重更大。小商店的营业额也很大，特别是百货、杂货、烟、酒、食品、油盐酱醋、饮食业等和居民日常生活关系十分密切的行业中，小商店的营业额，约占全部营业额的三分之一到二分之一。小商店的经营特点是：分布面很宽，和居民接近；出售商品很零星，没有固定的作息时间；一般有较固定的主顾，对熟悉的消费者还可以赊销和送货；有不少小商店依靠家庭的辅助劳动。对于小商店的改造工作，应当根据他们经营商品的特点和他们在商品流通中的不同作用，区别对待。一方面要注意通过统筹安排，维持他们的生活和营业，发挥他们的经营积极性；另一方面又要注意加强对他们的教育和管理，防止和克服他们的投机行为。一方面要注意在政治上和经济上改造他们；另一方面又要注意继续保持小商店便利消费者的优点。
    有少数小商店，是可以适当合并或适当集中的。这些小商店经营的商品，一般不属于人民日常需要的商品。其中一部分是经营生产资料的，例如医疗器械、印刷材料、电气材料等；一部分是经营不是人民每天所需要的生活资料的，例如文化教育用品、乐器、钟表眼镜等。有少数商品，例如绸布、西药，虽然与人民生活关系很密切，但适宜于开较大的商店，以便把商品的花色、品种准备得齐全些，便于购买者挑选。这种商店也可以适当合并和集中。合并和集中有两种办法，一种是把小商店合并于公私合营的较大的商店中，一种是把几家小商店合并起来，组织公私合营商店或合作商店。凡是合并、集中了的小商店，都应当定股定息，独立核算，逐步实行计件工资制。
    可以适当合并或适当集中的小商店，行业虽然不少，但户数并不多。在小商店中户数最多的，是日用杂货、食品、油盐酱醋、纸烟等几个行业，他们分布最广泛，和居民联系最密切，而且互相兼营。这些小商店除了个别的以外，一般是不宜于合并或集中的。现在有些地方合并、集中了一部分这类小商店，结果使居民感到很大不便，其中有些已经重新分散开了，有些正在酝酿分散开。对于这一类小商店，应当是通过经销代销或大部分是经销代销、小部分是自营（从手工业者和农民市场直接进货）的形式进行改造；使他们通过经销代销，取得相当于工资的差价或者手续费。他们的货架、柜台、桌椅目前仍然归他们私有，由他们从经销差价和代销手续费所得中自己去添置修补，这样他们在使用上更节省，而且可以减少国家一大笔投资。这种经销代销的形式，是公私合营的一种形式，因此仍然应该挂公私合营的招牌。有些地方在这一类小商店中实行了定股定息的办法，给小商店的从业人员发了固定工资，这些作法是不妥当的，应当改成经销代销。有些地方把他们组织成合作商店，如果实际上仍然是分散经营，自负盈亏，也可以考虑改成经销代销。
    饮食业的小商店，如面铺、小饭铺等，为数很多。在北京，他们的营业额约占全市饮食业营业额的三分之一。因为商品由他们自己加工，所以不能代销。其中有一部分比较集中的，可以合并成公私合营商店，实行定股定息；也可以组织起来成为合作食堂。但这类商店有相当大的一部分是不能合并的，因为他们的分散经营，对居民非常方便，所以只能在国营专业公司的管理下由他们自营。国营专业公司应该在以下几个方面加强对他们的管理，这就是根据具体情况，在保证不妨碍原有优点的条件下，有分别地而不是公式化地确定营业额、分配货源、规定价格和质量标准以及规定卫生条件等。这种在国营专业公司管理下自营的形式，在饮食业的小商店中还要保持一个相当长的时期。
    除了进行并店、实行定股定息的公私合营或组织合作商店以外的小商店，应当按地区、按行业把他们组织成互助小组，由专业公司或其区管理处设专人领导。这些互助小组的工作应当是：进行政治教育；在进货上互助（不是完全统一进货，而是为了调节劳动力，进行互助）；逐步举办福利事业，补助从业员生、老、病、死、伤、残的需要；配合国营公司进行监督管理。
    以上的办法一般是适用于大、中城市的。至于四、五万人口以下的小城市，就和大、中城市的情况有所不同。小城市的特点是：面积小，街道短，热闹的街道只有一两条，多半是在十字路口，集市附近。商店的营业主要靠农民进城购货，而不是靠本城居民。在小城市的分散的居民区，由于购买力低，商店很少，多半是摊贩。因此在小城市里，小商店的合并和集中的条件，比大、中城市要好一些。对小城市里集中在大街闹市上的小商店，一般可考虑采取并店、公私合营或组织合作商店的办法，把它们并成较大的商店。有些不同行业的商店，只要经营品种相接近（例如烟和酒），也可以合并。此外，也还有一些由于分散供应当地居民而不宜于合并、集中的小商店，可以同大、中城市一样，采取代销或大部分代销、小部分自营的方法。由于农村商业网的发展，在小城市中有一部分行业，过去是依靠下乡收购或下乡供货的，现在发生了困难。对于这些困难行业，应当结合城乡商业网的调整，在当地党政的统一领导下，由供销合作社统一安排。其中有些人可以到县以下的集镇和乡村去做小商贩，并兼营一部分代购代销的业务。
    要正确地选择对城市小商店的改造形式，必须十分重视对实际情况的调查研究，时时刻刻考虑到在经济改组的过程中保存和发扬一切原有的优良经验，便利人民的购买，满足人民的需要。一切只考虑商业部门经营管理上的便利而忽视营业质量和人民需要的观点是错误的。一切只从概念出发，而不从实际出发，认为“合并集中”一定比“分散经营”好；“统一计算盈亏”一定比“分散计算盈亏”好的观点也是错误的。对城市小商店的经济改组工作是一件十分复杂细致的工作，一定的改造形式、一定的组织形式、一定的管理制度必须与一定的经济情况相适应。必须做到经过改造和经济改组的小商店，为人民服务得更加周到，出售的商品更加齐全，商品的质量更好。只有这样，才能真正地表现社会主义经济的优越性。
