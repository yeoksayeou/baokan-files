The US Government Must Explain Bao Zhene's Cause of Death
-- Reader Letters Summary

"An irrepressible rage burns in our hearts... The US government must provide a detailed explanation for Bao Zhene's death." A group of high school students from Nanyang Middle School in Henan Province sent their letter of protest after reading "A Mother's Accusation" published in this newspaper on March 23rd. These words in the letter represent the anger of the vast number of readers at the US government's continued persecution of Chinese students studying abroad and Bao Zhene's unjust death in the United States.

Many readers, including Chen Zhusan from Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, Bai Zhanyou from Tianjin, and Liu Yan from Xi'an, pointed out in their letters that Bao Zhene's sudden death was very suspicious. Liu Yan said: "How could a strong young man suddenly die in a short period of time from a minor 'lung disease'? Bao Zhene's death caused the motherland to lose a talented individual for construction, and caused old Mrs. Wu Zhiyu to lose her loved one - unable to see him alive, unable to see his body in death. Every Chinese person, as well as every peace-loving and kind person in the world, including the American people, cannot help but feel grief and indignation about this matter, and protest to the US government. Now the deceased died with an unclear grievance, how can the living endure it, we demand that the US government provide an explanation for Bao Zhene's cause of death."

Many readers wrote in support of old Mrs. Wu Zhiyu's and other families of students studying in the US accusations against the US government. Wang Yuxiu from the First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changshan County, Shandong Province, and Zheng Wenpo, a public security soldier from the Baiyinchagan Station on the Jier Line, although with low levels of education, still took great pains to write letters to this newspaper. Wang Yuxiu said: "Students studying in the United States are not only relatives of the families of students studying in the United States, but also our relatives, they are the children of the motherland, we must not stand by and watch them be persecuted by the US government in this way." Zhao Xuewen, a Mongolian student from Beijing Meteorological School, said: "The era when the Chinese people were subjected to persecution and discrimination by imperialist elements has gone forever, we resolutely demand that the US government stop this crime." Many readers, including a group of students from Tianjin Normal College, Wang Jimai from Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, Mi Dehe and Zheng Yuanzhen from Zhengzhou City, Guo Ming from an agricultural production cooperative in Qinyang County, Henan Province, and Huang Junfeng from Wuhan City, all requested in their letters that the government seek justice for old Mrs. Wu Zhiyu and ensure the safety of other Chinese students still in the United States.

Old Mrs. Zhou Xianzhi from Hankou, whose only son is also in the United States, but has not been able to return due to the obstruction of the US government. She said in her letter: "Bao Zhene's death makes me feel extremely saddened, and also makes me more worried about the safety of students studying in the United States. The inhumane persecution of innocent Chinese youths by the US government only deepens my hatred for the US government." She believes that "Mrs. Wu's accusation is completely justified. We request the government to demand an explanation from the US government. We should also publicize the truth about the US government's brutal persecution of Chinese students studying abroad to countries around the world."

Many readers severely condemned the US government's inhuman persecution of Chinese students studying abroad in their letters. Shi Changhua, a reader from Ningbo City, said: "The US government's barbaric act of violating the agreement on the return of civilians from both sides in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks, persecuting and persecuting Chinese students studying abroad to death is intolerable. This is another atrocity following the persecution and forcible detention of Chinese and Korean prisoners of war after the Korean Armistice Agreement." Zhong Bianhen, a reader from Youyang County, Sichuan Province, said: "Thinking of the countless old and frail grandfathers and grandmothers, the infinitely anxious wives and innocent children, their hearts are filled with grief and indignation as they worry day and night about the safety of their relatives in the United States, and are constantly leaning on the door waiting for their return! Is this the democracy, freedom and humanitarianism that the US government is trying to boast to the people of the world?"

"US government, return our mother's children!" This is the call from all the students of Class 215 of Suzhou Construction Engineering School. They appealed to all kind and upright people in the world: "For the sake of mothers, wives and lovely children, in order to safeguard justice and human rights, we should severely condemn this brutal crime of the US government, and strive to thoroughly implement the agreement on the return of civilians from both sides in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks!"

### 美国政府必须交代鲍哲恩的死亡原因——读者来信综述

    美国政府必须交代鲍哲恩的死亡原因
    ——读者来信综述
      “不可遏止的怒火在我们心头燃烧……，美国政府对鲍哲恩的死亡原因必须详细交代。”河南省南阳中学一群高中学生读了三月二十三日本报登载的“母亲的控诉”之后，寄来了他们的抗议信。信中这几句话，代表了广大读者对美国政府继续迫害中国留学生和鲍哲恩冤死在美国的愤怒情绪。
    江苏省如东县陈祝三、天津市白占友和西安市刘炎等许多读者来信，指出鲍哲恩的突然死亡是很可疑的。刘炎说：“一个强壮的青年，怎么可能会因为轻微的‘肺病’而突然在短时期死亡呢？鲍哲恩的死，使祖国失去了一位建设人材，使吴志豫老太太失去了自己的亲人——生不能见人，死不能见尸。每一个中国人民，以及包括美国人民在内的全世界每一个爱好和平和善良的人，都不能不为这件事感到悲愤，并且向美国政府抗议。现在死者含冤莫明，生者何能忍受，我们要求美国政府对鲍哲恩的死亡原因作出交代。”
    许多读者来信支持吴志豫老太太和其他留美学生家属对美国政府的控诉。山东省长山县第一农业生产合作社王玉秀和集二线白音察干车站公安战士郑文颇虽然文化水平很低，但是仍然费了很大气力给本报写了信。王玉秀说：“留美学生不仅是留美学生家属的亲人，也是我们的亲人，他们是祖国的儿女，我们决不能眼看他们遭到美国政府如此的迫害。”北京气象学校蒙古族学生赵学文说：“中国人民任凭帝国主义分子迫害、歧视的时代已经一去不复返了，我们坚决要求美国政府制止这种罪行。”天津师范学院一群学生、四川省江津县王济迈、郑州市米德和郑元真、河南省沁阳县农业生产合作社郭铭、武汉市黄峻峰等许多读者的来信中，都要求政府替吴志豫老太太申冤作主，要美国政府保证其他仍在美国的中国留学生的安全。
    汉口的周先知老太太，她的独子也在美国，但是由于美国政府的阻挠，至今未能归来。她在来信中说：“鲍哲恩的死，使我感到万分痛心，也使我更为留美学生的安全耽心，美国政府惨无人道地迫害中国无辜青年的行为，只有加深我对美国政府的痛恨。”她认为：“吴老太太的控诉是完全有根据的。我们请求政府要美国政府作出交代。我们还应该向世界各国公布美国政府残酷迫害中国留学生的真相。”
    许多读者在来信中严厉地谴责美国政府这种毫无人性迫害中国留学生的暴行。宁波市读者施长华说：“美国政府违反中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题的协议，迫害并迫死中国留学生的野蛮行径是令人不能容忍的。这是继朝鲜停战协定后迫害和强力扣留中朝战俘以后的又一次暴行。”四川省酉阳县读者钟鞭痕说：“想到了无数老态龙钟的老伯伯和老大娘，无限焦虑的妻子和天真无邪的孩子，他们日夜为自己在美国的亲人的安全而担忧，时时刻刻都在倚门盼望他们归来的心情，不能不引起人们的悲愤！难道这就是美国政府竭力向全世界人民夸耀的民主、自由和人道吗？”
      “美国政府，还我母亲的儿女！”这是苏州建设工程学校二一五班全体同学发出的呼声。他们向全世界一切善良和正直的人们呼吁说：“为了母亲、妻子和可爱的孩子，为了维护正义人权，我们应严厉谴责美国政府这种凶暴罪行，为彻底实现中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题协议而奋斗！”
