Xinhua News Agency, April 21st, Colombo: The new Parliament of Ceylon held its opening ceremony on April 20th. All members of parliament attended the opening ceremony.

This is the first time since Ceylon's independence that all members of parliament have attended the parliamentary opening ceremony. Previously, opposition members of parliament had refused to attend such ceremonies to protest Ceylon's status as a British Commonwealth dominion. According to newspaper reports, the Ceylon Communist Party has announced that it will support the policies announced by the Bandaranaike-led government to strengthen national independence, expand democracy, and improve the people's living conditions.

The opening ceremony was presided over by the Governor-General of Ceylon, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke. In his opening address, he outlined the policies of the Bandaranaike government. He said that the government would consider the issue of establishing a republic "at the appropriate time," and the status of British military bases in Ceylon would also be studied.

Goonetilleke said that Ceylon would not join any major power bloc and would consider exchanging diplomatic representatives with countries to which Ceylon does not currently send diplomatic representatives.

He said that the Ceylon government would take steps as early as possible to nationalize important service sectors such as transportation. The government will abolish all undemocratic restrictions on trade union rights, and all restrictive laws will be revised or repealed.

He said that the government would take the necessary steps to make Sinhala a formal national language. In addition, he also talked about the government's policies on reducing the prices of essential goods, unemployment, and corruption.

    锡兰总督在新国会开幕典礼上谈国内外政策
    新华社21日讯  科伦坡消息：锡兰新国会在四月二十日举行了开幕典礼。全体议员都出席了开幕式。
    自从锡兰独立以来，全体议员参加国会开幕典礼这还是第一次。在这以前，反对党议员一直拒绝参加这种典礼，以对锡兰的英联邦自治领地位表示抗议。据报纸消息说，锡兰共产党已经宣布它将支持以班达拉奈克为首的政府所宣布的加强国家独立、扩大民主和改善人民生活条件的政策。
    国会开幕式由锡兰总督奥利弗·古涅狄莱克主持。他在开幕词中概述了班达拉奈克政府的政策。他说：政府将在“适当的时候”考虑建立共和国的问题，英国在锡兰的军事基地的地位也将要加以研究。
    古涅狄莱克说：锡兰将不使自己参加任何大国集团，并且将考虑同锡兰目前还没有派遣外交代表的国家交换外交代表。
    他说：锡兰政府将及早采取步骤把像运输那样一些重要的服务部门收归国有。政府将取消一切对工会权利的不民主的限制，一切约束性的法律将予以修正或废除。
    他说，政府将采取必要的步骤以使僧伽罗语作为国家的一种正式语言。此外，他还谈到了政府关于降低生活必需品价格、失业和贪污等等问题的政策。
