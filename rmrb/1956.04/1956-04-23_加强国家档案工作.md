Strengthen National Archives Work

The State Council’s decision on strengthening national archives work, published in this newspaper on April 21st, is a document of major historical significance for improving the work of state organs in our country, and also an important measure to prepare conditions for the development of scientific research work in our country. All state organs must strengthen our country’s archival work in accordance with this decision.

Archives are formed by all organs, troops, schools, organizations, enterprises, public institutions, and certain activists in their work and activities. Revolutionary historical archives and archives since the founding of the country record all the situations and achievements of the Party and the state power in leading the people of the whole country in production and political struggles. In addition to recording all the conspiracies and crimes of the reactionary rulers, the archives of the old regime also reflect the past production and political struggles of the people of the whole country. Archives are historical records, and not only do the organs that produce the archives need to consult them frequently within a certain period of time, but also national construction and scientific research work need to utilize archives for a long time. Archives are the common wealth of the country and the people.

Archival work, including the work of the archives rooms of organs and national archives, is to systematically collect, sort out, and preserve all national archives, and to catalog, index, organize reading and excerpts, provide certifications, provide information, compile document compilations, and publish historical documents according to the intentions of leaders, and so on. It is a necessary condition for improving the work of organs and conducting scientific research, and it is itself a complex and arduous scientific work, not just so-called "keeping archives," and even less can it be just "locking up" archives.

Although China's archival work has a long history, the reactionary rulers of the past could not conduct nationwide archival work from the long-term interests of the country and the nation, so the preserved archival materials are limited. In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we did not have time to fully carry out this work. Some achievements have been made since 1952, but from the perspective of the needs of the entire national construction undertaking and political struggle, this work is still very backward. In terms of the archival work of organs, the filing system has not been universally and correctly established, the management of archives is not centralized, the sorting methods are not uniform or scientific, and the appraisal and destruction lack certain standards and systems. The archival work institutions of various levels of organs are mostly incomplete, the number of staff is small, the business is unfamiliar, and especially there is a lack of leading backbone. This makes it impossible for the current archives of organs to be scientifically sorted in a timely manner, and some organs are even unmanaged, resulting in loss of documents, leakage of state secrets, and arbitrary destruction of documents. Regarding revolutionary historical archives and archives of the old regime, only a part of the centralized sorting work has been done, and most of them are still scattered in relevant organs at all levels.

Now we have accumulated a large amount of archival materials, and various national tasks require us to provide more reliable archival materials. The upcoming scientific and cultural upsurge will also require the use of various archival materials from various periods from various angles. If we do not strengthen the work of the archives rooms of organs and national archives in a timely manner, the development of China's scientific and cultural undertakings will encounter many difficulties due to the lack of this necessary condition.

Many leading comrades and staff members of some organs believe that archival work is "watching over waste paper" and "unpromising" work, which is completely wrong. To strengthen archival work, we must completely change people's views on this work and make everyone regard this work as an important undertaking.

Unified management must be implemented for all national archives. That is to say, the documents and materials of all organs must be filed by the document processing department, and then regularly filed to the archives room of the organ for centralized management; after being kept in the archives room for a certain number of years, all archives that should be permanently preserved must be concentrated in the central and local national archives, respectively, in order to organize people to use them and carry out systematic scientific research work. In order to facilitate storage, centralization, and research use, the management system and sorting methods of archives must be uniformly guided and supervised by the national archives management agency. Archives are the wealth of the entire country, not the wealth of individual organs or groups. Without a unified management system and unified sorting methods, without a unified organization to guide and supervise, and if each organ acts on its own and handles them arbitrarily, then the national archives cannot be completely preserved.

According to the current state of archival work, it is necessary for all organs to immediately start doing the following tasks: First, quickly promote the method of filing by the document processing department to establish a unified filing system. This is the starting point for doing a good job in the archival work of organs. Many organs have already promoted this system, which is very helpful to the work of the organs. Second, the accumulated archives since the founding of the country have not been sorted by most organs, making it very inconvenient to search and utilize. Sorting work is an arduous task for organs with too many accumulated archives, but it must be carried out persistently. Third, the revolutionary historical archives and archives of the old regime preserved by various organs must be cleaned up and sorted out well, and there must be no more losses, and arrangements should also be made to continue collecting them.

In order to strengthen archival work, it is also necessary to establish and strengthen archival work institutions and train cadres. Those organs that have not yet established archival work institutions should establish them quickly; those with too few cadres or too weak forces should be supplemented and adjusted, and the political and professional levels of archival staff should be continuously improved.

Strengthening archival work is an important political task. After the State Council's decision is announced, not only should all archival staff redouble their efforts, but also the leading staff and scientific workers of various organs should give frequent concern and support so that archival work can make rapid progress and play its due role in building the motherland and scientific research work.

### 加强国家档案工作

    加强国家档案工作
    本报四月二十一日刊登的国务院关于加强国家档案工作的决定，是改善我国国家机关工作的一个有重大历史意义的文件，也是为我国科学研究工作的开展准备条件的一项重要措施。一切国家机关必须根据这个决定加强我国的档案工作。
    档案是全国各个机关、部队、学校、团体、企业单位、事业单位和某些活动家在工作中和活动中所形成的。革命历史档案和建国以来的档案记录着党和国家政权领导全国人民进行生产斗争和政治斗争的一切情况和成果。旧政权的档案除了记录反动统治者的一切阴谋和罪恶以外，也反映着全国人民过去的生产斗争和政治斗争。档案是历史记录，不但产生档案的机关在一定的时间内经常需要查找档案，而且国家建设工作和科学研究工作在长久的年代里都需要利用档案。档案是国家和人民的公共财富。
    档案工作，包括机关档案室和国家档案馆的工作，是要把国家全部档案有计划地收集、整理和保管起来，并且进行编目，做索引，组织阅览和摘抄，提供证明，提供资料，编辑文件汇集，以及根据领导意图公布历史文献等等。它是改善机关工作和进行科学研究的必要条件，它本身又是一件复杂繁重的科学工作，而不只是所谓“保管档案”，更不能只是把档案“锁起来”。
    我国档案工作虽然历史悠久，但是过去的反动统治者不可能从国家民族的长远利益着想来进行全国规模的档案工作，因此保存下来的档案资料是有限的。中华人民共和国建国初期，我们也还来不及全面地开展这一工作。1952年以后取得了一些成绩，但从整个国家建设事业和政治斗争的需要来看，这一工作还是非常落后的。就机关的档案工作来说，归档制度还没有普遍地正确地建立起来，档案的管理不集中，整理方法不统一、不科学，鉴定和销毁还缺乏一定的标准和制度。各级机关的档案工作机构大都不健全，工作人员数量少，业务生疏，特别是缺少领导骨干。这就使得现行机关的档案不能得到及时的科学的整理，有的机关甚至无人管理，发生遗失文件、泄漏国家机密和任意销毁文件等现象。对于革命历史档案和旧政权档案，还只做了一部分集中整理的工作，大部分仍旧散存在各级有关机关。
    现在我们已经积存了大量的档案资料，而国家各项工作又要求我们提供更多的可靠的档案资料，即将到来的科学文化高潮，也将从各个角度要求利用各个时期的各种档案资料。如果我们再不及时地加强机关档案室和国家档案馆的工作，我国科学文化事业的发展就会因为缺乏这一必要的条件而发生很多困难。
    有不少机关的领导同志和工作人员认为档案工作是“看守废纸”、“没出息”的工作，这是完全错误的。要加强档案工作，就必须彻底改变人们这种看法，使大家都把这一工作看作一桩重要的事业。
    对于国家的全部档案，必须实行统一的管理。就是说，一切机关的文书材料必须由文书处理部门立卷，然后定期向机关档案室归档，集中管理；在档案室保管一定年限以后，所有应该永久保存的档案又必须分别向中央的和地方的国家档案馆集中，以便组织人们来利用它，开展系统的科学研究工作。为了便于保管、集中和研究使用，档案的管理制度和整理方法，都要由国家的档案管理机构进行统一的指导和监督。档案是整个国家的财富，不是个别机关或团体的财富，如果没有统一的管理制度和统一的整理方法，没有统一的组织去进行指导和监督，而由各机关自行其是，任意处理，那么国家的档案就不可能完整地保存下来。
    根据目前档案工作的状况，各机关有必要立即开始做好以下几项工作：第一、迅速推行文书处理部门立卷办法，以建立统一的归档制度。这是做好机关档案工作的起点。现在已经有许多机关推行了这种制度，对机关工作很有帮助。第二、建国以来的积存档案，各机关大都没有整理，查找利用十分不便。整理工作对积存档案太多的机关是一项繁重的任务，但是必须坚持进行。第三、各机关保存的革命历史档案和旧政权档案要很好地进行清理和整理，不得再有散失，并且还要作出安排，继续收集。
    为了加强档案工作，还必须建立和加强档案工作机构和培养干部。有些机关还没有建立档案工作机构的，要很快建立；干部太少或者力量太弱的，应该加以补充和调整，并且不断提高档案工作人员的政治水平和业务水平。
    加强档案工作是一项重要的政治任务，在国务院的决定公布之后，不仅全体档案工作人员应当加倍努力，各机关的领导工作人员和科学工作者也应当给以经常的关怀和支持，使档案工作迅速进步，在建设祖国和科学研究工作中发挥它应有的作用。
