    Moscow's Appearance Changes Daily
    Annual Passengers Exceed World Population
    In 1955, Moscow's trams and buses carried a total of 2,150 million passengers. If we also consider the Moscow subway, which transports more than 2.5 million passengers daily, then the total number of passengers using Moscow's public transportation in a year is far greater than the world's population.
    This year, Moscow's public transportation will see further development. Moscow will add 210 new, comfortable buses, 50 trolleybuses, and also lay new tram tracks.
    The work to open a new subway line is proceeding at the fastest speed. This subway line will connect the city center with the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition and the largest new stadium in the country, which is being built near Lenin Hills.
  Ambulance Cars Communicate by Radio
    Moscow's emergency station has been around for more than thirty-six years. If a resident of Moscow suddenly becomes ill, they do not need to go to the hospital for emergency treatment; they only need to notify the emergency station by telephone, and a car and medical personnel will arrive within minutes.
    The staff of the emergency station is working to speed up vehicle dispatch. Recently, each ambulance has been equipped with a special radio device to communicate directly with the emergency station's dispatch radio. The dispatcher can know which street these ambulances are driving on and can dispatch them via radio to the place where they are immediately needed, without waiting for the cars to return to the station.
  Construction of New Urban Areas is Accelerating
    A wide asphalt road connects the center of Moscow with Lenin Hills. This is the southwestern district of Moscow, which is very familiar to Muscovites. This is now a vast construction site. Many ten-story, twelve-story, and fourteen-story buildings are being built here using industrialized methods. The designs here are all standard designs, and all components are manufactured in factories.
    Currently, more than 10,000 cement workers, stonemasons, mechanics, and fitters are working here. This year, 7,500 apartments with a total area of 2.23 million square feet will be completed in this area. By 1960, 22 million square feet of housing will be built here, equivalent to one-fifth of the residential area of Moscow before the revolution.
  Wide-Screen Cinemas Under Construction
    Moscow currently has two wide-screen cinemas, which were converted from existing cinemas. Moscow is now building a new wide-screen cinema on Dobryninskaya Street. This cinema, which will open in the second half of this year, has 700 seats. In addition, the designs for three new wide-screen cinemas have been completed. These three cinemas have 800, 1,000, and 1,200 seats. Their screens will be made of special plastic and will be 16.5 meters wide, 2.5 meters wider than the screen of Moscow's first wide-screen "Art" cinema.

### 莫斯科面貌日日新

    莫斯科面貌日日新
    一年内乘客超过世界人口
    莫斯科市的电车和公共汽车在1955年共载客二十一亿五千万人。如果把莫斯科的地下电车道每昼夜可以载送二百五十多万的乘客计算在内，那末莫斯科市内交通一年的乘客总数就要比全世界的人口多得多。
    今年莫斯科的市内交通将有进一步的发展。莫斯科将要增添二百一十辆新的舒适的公共汽车，五十辆无轨电车，还要铺设新的有轨电车道。
    打通一条新的地下电车道的工作正在以最快的速度进行。这条地下电车道将使市中心同苏联农业展览会以及在列宁山附近建造的全国最大的新运动场联结起来。
  急救汽车用无线电联系
    莫斯科的急救站已经有三十六年多的历史了。莫斯科的居民患了急病，不需要到医院去挂急诊号，只要用电话通知急救站，几分钟内就有汽车和医护人员来到。
    急救站的工作人员努力加快车辆调度的速度。最近，每部急救车上都要装上专门的无线电装置，以便和急救站的调度电台直接联系。调度员可以知道这些急救车正在那条街上行驶，不必等待车子回站，就可以通过无线电调派到立刻需要去的地方去。
  新市区的建设加速进行
    一条宽广的柏油马路把莫斯科市中心和列宁山联系起来。这就是莫斯科人很熟悉的莫斯科西南区。这里现在是一片广大的建设工地。许多座十层、十二层、十四层的大楼，正在这里用工业化的方法建筑起来。这里的设计全部是标准设计，全部采用工厂制造的构件。
    目前，一万多个水泥工、石工、机械工、装配工正在这里劳动着。今年，这个区域内要建成七千五百套总面积为二百二十三万平方英尺的住宅。到1960年，这里将要建成二千二百万平方英尺的住宅，等于革命前莫斯科住宅面积的五分之一。
  宽银幕电影院正在兴修
    莫斯科现在有两家宽银幕电影院，是由原有的电影院改装而成的。现在莫斯科正在多布宁斯克街专门修建一家新的宽银幕电影院。这家电影院，将在今年下半年内开幕，它有七百个座位。另外还有三家新宽银幕影院已经完成了设计。这三家电影院的座位是八百、一千和一千二百个。它们的银幕将是用专门的塑料作成，各宽十六公尺半，比莫斯科第一家宽银幕“艺术”电影院的银幕还宽两公尺半。
