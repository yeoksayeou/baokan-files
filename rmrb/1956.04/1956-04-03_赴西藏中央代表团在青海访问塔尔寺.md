Xinhua News Agency report:

    The head of the Central Delegation to Tibet, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, and the deputy head and members of the delegation arrived in Xining, Qinghai Province on March 31st. On the morning of April 1st, they visited Tar Monastery.

    Approximately six hundred lamas lined up in front of the monastery to welcome the arrival of the Central Delegation to Tibet with the most solemn religious ceremonies. Tar Monastery's Dharma Throne Saichi Living Buddha and Grand Abbot Ci Cheng Jian Cuo presented Hada scarves to Chen Yi at the location of a "Treasure Vase" drawn on the ground with plaster powder (signifying welcome).

    Saichi Living Buddha accompanied Chen Yi and the delegation members to first visit the Great Sutra Hall, which can accommodate three thousand lamas chanting scriptures. They walked onto the roof of the Sutra Hall, overlooking the entire Tar Monastery. Saichi Living Buddha pointed to the gilded roof of the Great Golden Tile Temple, shining in the sunlight, and said to Chen Yi: Before liberation, the roof of the Golden Tile Temple was dilapidated. After liberation, with the care and assistance of the People's Government, the roof was repaired.

    Chen Yi and the delegation members visited the Upper and Lower Hua Gardens and viewed various sculptures made of yak butter, depicting various Buddhist stories, including figures, houses, flowers, and fruits. These items were sculpted very realistically. Chen Yi said to the delegation members that the artistic value of these sculptures is very high.

    Angiás Living Buddha described to Chen Yi how the lives of the lamas in the monastery have improved since liberation. Chen Yi said that only by relying on the great unity between all nationalities and within each nationality can China be built well and can the improvement of the lives of all ethnic groups be guaranteed. He hoped that the Dharma Throne, Living Buddhas, monks, and others of Tar Monastery would further play a positive role on the basis of the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities.

    Before the delegation left Tar Monastery, Chen Yi, on behalf of the Central Delegation to Tibet, made donations to all the monks in the monastery.

    Tar Monastery is located in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, and is one of the six major monasteries of the Gelug school (Yellow Hat sect) of Tibetan Buddhism in the country.

    赴西藏中央代表团在青海访问塔尔寺
    赴西藏中央代表团团长、国务院副总理陈毅和副团长、团员等人三月三十一日到达青海省西宁，四月一日上午访问了塔尔寺。
    约有六百个喇嘛列队在寺院前，以最隆重的宗教礼节来欢迎赴西藏中央代表团的到来。塔尔寺法台赛池活佛、大僧官慈成尖错在地上用石膏粉画的聚宝盆（表示迎接）的地方，向陈毅献了哈达。
    赛池活佛陪同陈毅和代表团团员首先参观了大经堂，这个经堂可供三千个喇嘛念经。他们走上了经堂的屋顶，俯视塔尔寺全景。赛池活佛指着在阳光下闪闪发光的大金瓦寺的涂金的屋顶，对陈毅说：解放以前，金瓦寺的屋顶破烂不堪，解放以后，在人民政府关怀和帮助下，重新修补了这个屋顶。
    陈毅和代表团团员在上下作花园观看了以各种佛教故事为内容，用酥油做的各种人像、房屋、花果等，这些物品塑得十分逼真，陈毅对团员们说，这些塑制品的艺术价值是很高的。
    安嘉斯活佛向陈毅叙述了解放以后，寺院内的喇嘛们的生活得到改善的情况。陈毅说，依靠各民族之间和各民族内部的大团结，才能把中国建设好，才能保证提高各族人民的生活。他希望塔尔寺的法台、活佛、僧众等在汉藏民族的团结基础上，更加发挥积极的作用。
    代表团离开塔尔寺前，陈毅代表赴藏中央代表团向全寺僧众布施。
    塔尔寺在青海省湟中县，是全国著名的黄教六大寺院之一。
