    To Complete the First Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Creating the Highest Record of Coal Mine Retreating Efficiency
    Learning Technology, Improving Production
    Comrade Editor:
        I am a milling worker. At the end of 1955, I completed my five-year workload two years and eleven days ahead of schedule.
        When I first switched from being a fitter to a milling worker, I was not familiar with the technology of operating a milling machine. Therefore, I used my spare time to learn from experienced masters, read relevant technical books, and attend technical training classes in the factory. This improved my technical level and enabled me to study and improve working methods. For example, after studying the lever principle in physics, I studied how to use levers to clamp the door hinge bracket, which was processed in large quantities. After this method was successfully tested, the manual time required for clamping, aligning, and unloading each piece was reduced from three minutes to three seconds. Later, I made some improvements to the processing method, and the production of door hinge brackets increased from 50 to 300 per day. Later, I also created four types of fixtures for milling the edges of valve bodies and spring inner rods, which generally increased product quality and output by one to six times. Therefore, I completed the production plan ahead of schedule every month.
        I not only learned from books, but also paid attention to learning from other people's advanced experiences, especially the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. For example, high-speed cutting, Kolezov toolposts, and fixtures have played a significant role in improving labor efficiency. For the past three years, I have always used the Kolezov toolpost's advanced experience to perform fast cutting on the milling machine; many of my fixtures were created based on the experience of veteran technicians and supplemented according to my own specific circumstances.

    Comrade Editor:
        The workers of the 7092 coal face in the eighth coal mining district of Kailuan Linxi Mine are excited to report to you that we have actively improved our operating methods, thus overfulfilling the coal production plan and creating the highest record of coal recovery efficiency in the country.
        Since February of this year, our eighth coal mining district has conscientiously studied and promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet single-shift coal mining system, changing the past practice of two shifts of coal mining and one shift of preparation work to one shift of coal mining and two shifts of preparation work. This has greatly reduced auxiliary work and saved one-third of the manpower compared to the past two shifts of coal mining. In order to implement the advanced experience of single-shift coal mining, various work groups have also actively studied and promoted advanced experiences such as rapid conveyor belt moving, integrated winch prop recovery, single-person electric drills, and safe operation of electric chutes. For example, the props on the coal mining face should be completely recovered in one shift according to regulations, but because of the low prop recovery efficiency, the other two shifts also had to do prop recovery work, which affected the production order. Later, after research by the workers, the hand-cranked "Qianbula" prop recovery was changed to electric winch prop recovery, and the integrated winch prop recovery method was learned. As a result, the prop recovery efficiency was significantly improved, not only able to complete the task on time, but also reducing the number of people from fourteen to six. Due to the promotion of advanced experience, the average coal mining volume per worker can often reach more than thirteen tons, and the efficiency is more than 60% higher than in the past.
        Coal mining efficiency has improved, but in production, the problem of cyclical operations not being completed according to plan still occurs frequently. According to the requirements of the coal mining plan, the working face must advance two rows of props, but in reality, it can only advance one and a half rows of props. Irregular cyclical operations not only affect the further improvement of coal production, but also fail to ensure safe production. Later, Zhang Zhaoquan, the production team leader, proposed changing the shift time of coal miners and coal loaders and implementing cross-operations, which ensured that the working face advanced two rows of props every day, and also solved the problem of uneven coal output and the inability to transport stored coal in the past.
        From the middle of February to the middle of March, the actual coal production of our face exceeded the original plan by more than 1,300 tons, and the highest coal recovery efficiency reached an average of 15.68 tons per person per day, creating the highest record in the country.

    Shortening Equipment Maintenance Time
    Comrade Editor:
    In the past, the Anshan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill had to shut down for 48 hours each month for equipment maintenance; this year, the production tasks have increased, and the maintenance tasks have also increased accordingly. Therefore, Li Yuxiu, the shift leader of the rolling mill maintenance section, wanted to find a way to improve maintenance efficiency. Later, he thought that if maintenance could be carried out during the gaps when production workers were changing rolls and waiting for materials and heat, less production time could be wasted. This idea of his was supported by everyone in the group.
        That day, the equipment assistant came to solicit specific measures to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and Li Yuxiu put forward his plan. Who knew that the equipment assistant would say: "The production potential is great, what's the point of deducting this little time." Li Yuxiu also proposed this initiative to the head of the rolling mill maintenance section, and the answer he got was: "Shortening maintenance time is not a good idea."
        Later, with the support of the workers, Li Yuxiu brought his initiative to the factory's Party Committee. After careful study, the Party Committee immediately supported his opinion. Soon, the factory's water pipes broke, and production had to be stopped for eight hours for repairs. With the support of the maintenance workers, Li Yuxiu decided to use this time to do maintenance work. At that time, the head of the rolling mill maintenance section and the maintenance planner still did not approve of this practice, and there were not enough cranes, but thanks to the active efforts of all the maintenance workers, the maintenance work that was originally planned to take sixteen hours was completed in only six hours.
        With the support of the Party and the masses, Li Yuxiu's initiative finally overcame the obstacles of conservative thinking and was successfully tested. In this way, the average monthly maintenance time can be shortened by twelve hours, and the time saved throughout the year can allow the country to roll tens of thousands of tons of heavy rail steel.

    为了提早完成第一个五年计划
    创造煤矿回采效率的最高纪录
    学习技术，提高生产编辑同志：
    我是一个铣工。1955年末，我提前两年零十一天完成了自己五年的工作量。
    当我刚从钳工改作铣工的时候，我对操纵铣床的技术一点也不熟悉。于是，我就利用业余时间向老师傅学习，并且阅读有关技术书籍和参加厂里的技术学习班。这就使我提高了技术水平，并且能够来研究改进工作方法。像我学习了物理学中的杠杆原理以后，就研究将大量加工的门轴托这个活运用杠杆来把活。这个方法试验成功以后，每一个活需要的把活、找正、卸活的手动时间，就从三分钟降低到三秒钟。后来我在加工方法上又作了一些改进，门轴托的生产量就由每天五十个提高到三百个。以后我还创造了瓦体铣边、弹簧内杆等四种胎具，产品质量和产量普遍提高了一倍到六倍，因此我每月都提前完成了生产计划。
    我不光是从书本中学习，还注意学习别人的先进经验，特别是苏联的先进经验。例如高速切削、科列索夫车刀以及胎卡具等，都对提高劳动效率起了重大的作用。三年来，我始终按照着科列索夫车刀的先进经验在铣床上进行快速切削；我有不少的胎具是根据老技术工人的经验，再根据自己的具体情况加以补充而创造出来的。
          大连工矿车辆厂铣工　卢盛和编辑同志：
    我们开滦林西矿第八采煤区7092掌的工人们兴奋地向你报告，我们积极改进了操作方法，因此超额完成了产煤计划，创造了全国回采工作效率的最高纪录。
    从今年二月份起，我们第八采煤区认真学习和推行了苏联一班采煤制的先进经验，把过去两班采煤、一班作准备工作的做法改为一班采煤、两班作准备工作。这样就大大减少了辅助工作，比过去两班采煤的时候节省了三分之一的人力。为了实行一班采煤的先进经验，各个工种小组还积极学习和推行快速移溜、综合绞车回柱、单人电钻、电溜子安全运转等先进经验。例如，采煤工作面上的柱子按规定应当在一班完全回清，但是因为回柱效率低，其他两班也要做回柱工作，因而影响了生产秩序。后来经过工人们研究，把手摇“千不拉”回柱改为用电力绞车回柱，并且学习了综合绞车回柱法，于是回柱效率显著提高，不仅能够按时完成任务，而且由原来十四个人减少到六个人。由于推广了先进经验，平均每个工人的采煤量经常可以达到十三吨以上，效率比过去提高60％多。
    采煤效率提高了，但是在生产中还经常发生循环作业不能按计划完成的情况。按照采煤计划的要求，工作面采煤必须前进两排柱子，但实际上只能前进一排半柱子。循环作业不正规，不但影响产煤量的进一步提高，而且不能保证安全生产。后来生产组长张兆全提出改变采煤工和攉煤工的上掌时间和实行交叉作业的办法，每天就能够保证工作面采煤前进两排柱子，而且还解决了过去由于出煤不均衡，存煤运不出去的问题。
    从二月中旬开采到三月中旬为止，我们掌子上实际的产煤量超过原计划一千三百多吨，回采工作效率最高达到每人每天平均完成十五点六八吨，创造了全国最高纪录。

    缩短设备检修时间编辑同志：鞍钢大型轧钢厂过去每月为了设备检修要停产四十八小时；今年生产任务增加了，检修任务也随着增加了。因此，轧钢检修工段值班长李毓秀就想找个窍门来提高检修的效率。后来他想到，如果利用生产工人换轧辊和待料、待热的空隙时间进行检修，就可以少耽误生产时间。他这个想法在小组里受到了大伙的支持。
    当天，设备助理来征求提前完成五年计划的具体措施，李毓秀就提出了自己的计划。谁知道设备助理却说：“生产潜力很大，扣这点时间有什么意思。”李毓秀又向轧钢检修工段长提出这个倡议，得到的答复是：“缩短检修时间这件事不太好。”
    后来，李毓秀在工人的支持下，把自己的倡议提到厂的党委会。党委会经过慎重研究以后，立即支持了他的意见。不久，正赶上厂里水管坏了，要停产八小时来进行修理。李毓秀在检修工人的支持下，决定利用这个时间来做检修工作。当时轧钢检修工段长和检修计划员仍然不赞成这种做法，而且吊车还不够用，但是由于全体检修工人的积极努力，原来计划需要十六小时的检修工作，只用六小时就完成了。
    李毓秀的倡议在党和群众的支持下，终于战胜了保守思想的阻碍而试验成功了。这样，每月平均能缩短检修时间十二小时，全年节约下来的时间，能给国家多轧几万吨重轨钢。　王常义
