    A Great Surprise and In-depth Leadership
    By Our Correspondent Chen Ji
    In February, Changchun was still icy everywhere, but the drivers of the Changchun Locomotive Depot proudly said, "There is no winter here for us." In the socialist emulation drive to haul more and run faster, all the depot's drivers forgot the severe winter cold. As early as February 10th, they implemented the Ministry of Railways' summer traction quota of 2,700 tons three months ahead of schedule, 450 tons more than last year's traction quota. In order to haul even more and run faster, some drivers proposed launching a movement to achieve one million ton-kilometers per day. In early March, more than ten drivers were able to pull one million ton-kilometers.
    This unprecedentedly high socialist emulation drive is a great force for universally improving railway work. Railway leading personnel must quickly take measures to guide the enthusiasm of the masses onto the path of universally improving railway work. Unfortunately, some leading personnel of the Changchun Railway Sub-bureau believed that the masses could not quickly break through the quota. When the drivers broke through this year's quota of 2,400 tons, they were surprised: The weather is so cold, it has always been difficult to pull 2,400 tons, how can it be broken through? When the drivers were universally moving towards the 2,700-ton quota, they said again: The slopes are so steep, can all the drivers pull so much? When all the drivers broke through the 2,700-ton quota within forty days, they were greatly surprised: How can they run so fast?
    Because of underestimating the strength of the masses and not being able to come up with specific measures, advanced experience was not universally promoted at the beginning of the movement. Some drivers with poor skills had accidents where they could not pull the load, disrupting the train schedule. These leading personnel did not seriously study why the accidents occurred, and only generally believed: "More overloading will lead to more accidents." Geng Shaozhou, deputy section chief of the locomotive section, stayed in his room every day, formulating plans based on this principle, only allowing drivers he thought could overload to overload, and not allowing drivers he thought could not overload to overload. On January 26th, a driver took the initiative to request overloading to pull 2,990 tons. Geng Shaozhou said: "This driver is not capable, he must not pull so much." But not long after Geng Shaozhou said this, the driver not only safely pulled 2,990 tons, but also arrived at the destination a few minutes ahead of schedule. Several times, the drivers asked the station to add more cars, but Geng Shaozhou said: "We can't add more, if we add more, we won't let you pull." The drivers asked angrily: What kind of leadership is this? Wang Zhifang, chief of the car section, also said: "Old Geng, you can't suppress the emotions of the masses, how can you be a section chief!" However, the people who led Geng Shaozhou thought "this is what leadership is called." They once sat in the office and issued instructions for the Changchun Railway Sub-bureau to carry out overloading in a step-by-step manner. The so-called step was "to pull 2,700 tons in April." Many people who heard this opinion asked strangely: Why should the quota that could be achieved on February 10th be delayed until April?
    There is a theory that the current locomotives do not have enough evaporation capacity, and cannot climb difficult slopes when pulling 2,700 tons; to climb difficult slopes, another locomotive must be added. Some leading personnel, based on this theory, approved the Changchun Locomotive Depot to add another locomotive in the difficult slope areas. However, the creative drivers did not add locomotives and still pulled 2,700 tons to climb the difficult slopes. These leading personnel did not know this living fact and were still saying: Additional locomotives can be added. Not only that, but some people, based on past experience, believed that small water tank locomotives must be converted to large water tank locomotives to overload. The drivers were not bound by this experience, and even overloaded with small water tank locomotives.
    The Changchun Railway Sub-bureau's Party organization and administrative departments inspected this serious situation where the leadership lagged behind the masses and realized that the reason why some leading personnel made the mistake of right-leaning conservative thought was that they were divorced from life and divorced from the masses. The director, deputy director, director of the political department, and chairman of the trade union of the sub-bureau went to the masses to find solutions, formulate measures, and actively lead the drivers to overload. Among the masses, weak links were constantly discovered, and active measures were taken. Many leading personnel personally organized overloaded trains and studied the experience of overloading with the drivers. They found that some drivers not only could overload more, but also were very safe; some drivers not only pulled less, but also had accidents; some drivers could pull more and save coal, and some drivers could neither pull more nor save coal. They analyzed this situation and decided to summarize the various experiences of advanced drivers, compile an overloading manual, and teach it to each driver. At the same time, they also organized drivers who were good at overloading to drive with drivers who were not good at overloading to promote advanced experience. Doing this specific organizational work helped drivers with poor technical conditions overcome the shortcomings of not being able to pull the load. All the depot's drivers universally improved, and everyone was able to overload more. The leading personnel of the Changchun Railway Sub-bureau also specifically analyzed the situation of transportation organization work and found that backward phenomena affected overloading due to poor dispatching and command work. Some drivers were required to stop at stations in front of slopes where they should not have stopped, making it difficult for the drivers to climb the slopes. Due to poor connection and disconnection of locomotives and trains, high-quality overloading could not be achieved. In response to these shortcomings, measures were proposed to comprehensively improve railway work. Leaders checked the implementation of these measures at any time, eliminating the backward phenomenon that hinders overloading due to poor transportation work. The drivers saw that the leadership was so specifically and actively leading, and they further increased their enthusiasm for overloading. On January 24th, only 28% of the drivers could overload to pull 2,700 tons; after more than ten days, all drivers could pull 2,700 tons.
    While the Changchun Railway Sub-bureau comprehensively took measures to strengthen leadership, it also opposed the one-sided view of "only caring about overloading and not caring about quality." Some people believed: "When the masses come together, it doesn't matter if some accidents happen," and did not combine overloading with safety, trains arriving on time, and saving. The current problem is that on the one hand, they pull more, and on the other hand, they waste more coal; they pull more uphill, and pull less downhill. Empty locomotives are increasing. Delays still occur. Downhill drivers are unwilling to pull more empty cars, pulling only seven or eight hundred tons in one trip, which is about two thousand tons less than pulling uphill heavy cars. This imbalance needs to continue to strengthen comprehensive leadership and criticize the incorrect thinking of engaging in overloading movements away from economic results.

    大吃一惊和深入领导
    本报记者　陈迹
    二月的长春还到处结冰，长春机务段的司机们却自毫地说：“咱们这里没有冬天。”在多拉快跑的社会主义竞赛中，全段司机忘记了冬天的严寒，早在二月十日，提前三个月实行铁道部规定的夏季牵引定额——二千七百吨，比去年牵引定额多拉四百五十吨。为了进一步多拉快跑，有些司机又提出开展日产一百万吨公里的运动。三月初，十多名司机能够拉到一百万吨公里。
    这种空前高涨的社会主义竞赛，是普遍提高铁路工作的伟大动力。铁路领导工作人员，必须迅速采取措施，把群众的热情引导到普遍提高铁路工作的途径。可惜，长春铁路分局有些领导工作人员，却认为群众不能迅速突破定额。当司机们突破今年二千四百吨定额的时候，他们奇怪：天气这么冷，从来都很难拉到二千四百吨，怎么还能突破呢？当司机们普遍向二千七百吨定额迈进的时候，他们又说：坡道这么大，难道所有的司机都能拉这么多吗？当所有司机在四十天时间内突破二千七百吨定额的时候，他们才大吃一惊：怎么跑得这样快？
    因为对群众力量估计不足，拿不出具体的措施来，在运动的开头，没有普遍推广先进经验，有些技术差的司机发生拉不动的事故，打乱列车运行图。这些领导工作人员，没有认真研究为什么会出事故，就只笼统地认为：“多超轴，就会多出事故。”机务科副科长耿绍周天天关在房里，根据这个原则拟计划，只许他认为能超轴的司机超轴，不许他认为不能超轴的司机超轴。一月二十六日，有位司机主动要求超轴牵引二千九百九十吨，耿绍周说：“这个司机不行，决不能拉这么多。”但是耿绍周说出这话没有多久，这位司机不但安全地拉了二千九百九十吨，而且还提前几分钟到达目的地。有几次，司机们要求车站多编几辆车，耿绍周说：“不能多编了，多编了就不许拉。”司机们很气愤地问道：这叫什么领导？车务科科长王志芳也说：“老耿，你压不住群众情绪，看你怎么当科长！”可是，领导耿绍周的人却认为“这才叫做领导”。他们曾经坐在办公室发出指示，要长春铁路分局有步骤地开展超轴。所谓的步骤就是“四月份拉二千七百吨”。许多人听了这个意见，奇怪地问道：为什么二月十日能够实现的定额，偏偏要拖到四月去实现呢？
    有一种理论认为现在的机车蒸发能力不够，拉二千七百吨，就不能爬过困难的坡道；要想爬过困难的坡道，就得增加一台机车。有些领导工作人员根据这种理论，批准长春机务段在困难坡道地方增加一台机车。但是，富有创造性的司机们没有增加机车，也拉了二千七百吨爬过困难的坡道。这些领导工作人员不知道这个活生生的事实，居然还在说：可以增加补充机车。不仅如此，有些人还根据以往的经验，认为必须把小水柜的机车改成大水柜的，才能超轴。司机们没有受这种经验的束缚，用小水柜的机车也都超轴了。
    长春铁路分局党组织和行政部门检查了这种领导落后于群众的严重情况，认识到有些领导工作人员所以犯右倾保守思想的毛病，是在于脱离生活，脱离群众。分局局长、副局长、政治处主任和工会主席等到群众中去，找办法，拟定措施，积极领导司机超轴。在群众中，不断发现薄弱的环节，积极采取措施。许多领导工作人员亲自组织超轴的列车，并且同司机们一道研究超轴的经验。他们发现有些司机不但能多超轴而且很安全，有些司机不但拉得少而且出事故；有些司机既能多拉又能省煤，有些司机既不能多拉又不能省煤。他们分析了这种情况，决定把先进司机的各种经验，汇总起来，编成超轴手册，向每个司机讲授。同时，还组织善于超轴的司机跟随不善于超轴的司机去开车，推广先进经验。做了这些具体的组织工作，就帮助技术条件差的司机克服了拉不动的缺点。全段司机都普遍提高，人人能够多超轴。长春铁路分局领导工作人员又具体分析了运输组织工作的情况，发现因为调度指挥工作不好而影响超轴的落后现象。有些不该在坡道前面车站停车的，却要司机停车，使得司机在爬坡道时发生困难。由于机车和列车卸接得不好，质量良好的超轴一度不能实现。针对这些缺点，提出全面改善铁路工作的措施。领导人员随时检查这些措施执行的情况，消除那种因为运输工作不善而妨碍超轴的落后现象。司机们眼看领导方面这样具体地积极领导，都进一步提高超轴的热情。一月二十四日只有28％的司机能超轴牵引二千七百吨；过了十多天，所有司机都能拉二千七百吨。
    长春铁路分局在全面采取措施加强领导的同时，也反对了“只管超轴，不管质量”的片面观点。有些人认为：“群众一起来，出些事故没有啥，”不把超轴同安全、列车按规定钟点到达和节约结合起来。目前的问题是一方面拉得多，一方面多费煤；上行拉得多，下行拉得少。空跑的机车正增加。运缓事故还发生。下行的司机不愿多拉空车，一趟只拉七八百吨，比拉上行重车还少拉二千吨左右。这种不平衡的状况，需要继续加强全面的领导，批判那些离开经济效果而搞超轴运动的不正确思想。
