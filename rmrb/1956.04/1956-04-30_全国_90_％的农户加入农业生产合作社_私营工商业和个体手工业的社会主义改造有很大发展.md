Xinhua News Agency, 29th: According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, as of the end of March 1956, the socialist transformation of agriculture, capitalist industry and commerce, individual handicraft industry, and private transportation in China had achieved further victories nationwide.
	The total number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide reached 1,088,000, with 106,680,000 farmer households participating, accounting for 90% of the total number of farmer households nationwide. Among them, except for Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces, which were above 70% but below 80%, the remaining provinces and cities were all above 80%, and fifteen provinces and cities reached above 90%. High-level agricultural production cooperatives with a completely socialist nature have also greatly developed, with farmer households participating in high-level cooperatives accounting for 55% of the total number of farmer households nationwide. Furthermore, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Guangxi, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai ten provinces and cities exceeded 85%. While the agricultural cooperativization movement greatly developed, many agricultural production cooperatives made appropriate mergers. As a result of the merger of small cooperatives into large cooperatives, the number of cooperatives at the end of March decreased by 816,000 compared to the end of 1955, but the number of participating farmer households increased by more than 31,220,000, with the average number of households per cooperative increasing from forty to ninety-eight. The average is fifty households for elementary cooperatives and two hundred and fifty households for advanced cooperatives. Due to the implementation of the policy of simultaneous rectification and improvement during the development process, the quality of agricultural production cooperatives has generally improved.
	The first quarter of 1956 saw a high tide in the joint state-private ownership of entire industries in private industry. In total, more than 70,000 new joint-operated industrial enterprises were established in the entire quarter, with a total of 1,070,000 employees and a total output value of nearly 6.6 billion yuan. The proportion of newly joint-operated industries to the original private industries at the end of 1955 was: 77% in terms of the number of enterprises, 83% in terms of the number of employees, and 92% in terms of total output value. The private industries in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hebei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin and other provinces and cities have basically all been transformed into joint state-private ownership; the output value of newly joint-operated enterprises in Shandong, Liaoning, Hubei, Inner Mongolia and other places has also reached more than 90%.
	The handicraft industry cooperativization movement has also seen tremendous development. As of the end of March, the number of people participating in handicraft cooperative organizations nationwide has reached nearly 4.3 million, accounting for 88% of the number of handicraft practitioners who should be transformed by the handicraft sector (another nearly 2.4 million people have been assigned to the agricultural, commercial, and local industrial sectors for transformation).
	In terms of private commerce, in cities above the provincial level nationwide, 287,000 shops have been transformed into joint state-private ownership, with a total of 617,000 employees and a capital of 320 million yuan; 75,000 restaurants have been transformed into joint state-private ownership, with a total of 182,000 employees and a capital of 27 million yuan. The proportion of newly joint-operated enterprises to the original private commerce and catering industry at the end of 1955 was: 28% in terms of the number of commercial establishments, 44% in terms of the number of employees, and 75% in terms of capital; 36% in terms of the number of catering establishments, 47% in terms of the number of employees, and 77% in terms of capital. That is to say, the number of people transformed into joint state-private ownership in the private commerce and catering industries is approaching half, and the amount of capital has reached three-quarters.
	The transformation of the private transportation industry is also progressing rapidly. As of the end of March, 99% of private tugboats have implemented joint state-private ownership (only 48.4% at the end of 1955); only 71.5% of private wooden sailing boats have been transformed (only 1% at the end of 1955), of which 95% participated in transportation cooperatives and 5% adopted the fixed-interest method of joint operation; 99.5% of private motor vehicles have implemented joint state-private ownership or participated in cooperatives; and 67% of animal-drawn vehicles have also participated in transportation cooperatives.
	Currently, work such as asset verification, fixed interest rates, and economic reorganization of joint state-private enterprises is gradually unfolding. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-one provinces and cities, more than 37% of joint state-private industrial enterprises have completed asset verification work; in cities above the provincial level, 20% of joint-operated commercial enterprises and 22% of joint-operated catering enterprises have completed asset verification work.

    全国90％的农户加入农业生产合作社
    私营工商业和个体手工业的社会主义改造有很大发展
    新华社29日讯  根据国家统计局统计，我国农业、资本主义工商业、个体手工业和私营运输业的社会主义改造，截至1956年3月底止，在全国范围内取得了进一步的胜利。
    全国农业生产合作社共达1，088，000个，入社农户10，668万户，占全国农户总数的90％。其中，除湖南、四川、云南三省在70％以上不到80％以外，其余省、市都在80％以上，并且有十五个省、市达到90。％以上。完全社会主义性质的高级农业生产合作社也有了很大的发展，参加高级社的农户已占全国农户总数的55％，河北、山西、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、青海、广西、北京、天津、上海十个省、市并且超过了85％。在农业合作化运动大发展的同时，很多农业生产合作社作了适当的合并，由于小社并大社的结果，三月底的社数比1955年底减少了816，000个，但入社农户增加了3，122万多户，平均每社已由四十户增加到九十八户，初级社平均五十户，高级社平均二百五十户。由于在发展过程中贯彻了同时整顿和提高的方针，农业生产合作社的质量一般都有所提高。
    1956年第一季度私营工业的全行业公私合营形成了高潮。全季新合营的工业企业共达七万多户，这些企业共有职工一百零七万人，总产值近六十六亿元。新合营工业占1955年底原有私营工业的比重是：户数达77％，职工人数达83％，总产值达92％。北京、天津、上海、河北、江苏、江西、吉林等省、市的私营工业基本上已经全部转为公私合营；山东、辽宁、湖北、内蒙古等地新合营企业的产值也达到90％以上。
  手工业合作化运动也有了巨大的发展，截至三月底，全国参加手工业合作组织的人数已近四百三十万人，占应由手工业部门改造的手工业从业人数的88％（另有近二百四十万人划归农业、商业和地方工业部门加以改造）。
    在私营商业方面，全国省辖市以上的城市中，已经有二十八万七千户商店转变为公私合营，它们共有从业人员六十一万七千人，资本额三亿二千万元；有七万五千户饮食店转变为公私合营，它们共有从业人员十八万二千人，资本额二千七百万元。新合营企业占1955年底原有的私营商业和饮食业的比重是：商业户数占28％，从业人数占44％，资本额占75％；饮食业户数占36％，从业人数占47％，资本额占77％。这就是说，私营商业和饮食业转变为公私合营的人数已接近一半，资本额已达到四分之三。
    私营运输业的改造进度也很迅速，截至三月底，私营轮驳船只已经有99％实行了公私合营（1955年底只有48.4％）；私营木帆船只有71.5％进行了改造（1955年底只有1％），其中，参加运输合作社的占95％，采用定息方式合营的占5％；私营汽车车辆数已经有99.5％实行公私合营或参加合作社；兽力车也有67％参加了运输合作社。
    目前公私合营企业的清产核资、定息和经济改组等工作正在逐步展开。根据二十一个省、市的不完全统计，公私合营工业已经有37％以上的企业完成了清产核资工作；在省辖市以上的城市中，有20％的合营商业和22％的合营饮食业完成了清产核资工作。
