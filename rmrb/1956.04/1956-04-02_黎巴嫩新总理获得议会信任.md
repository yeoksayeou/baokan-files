Xinhua News Agency, Beirut: On March 29th, the new Lebanese Prime Minister, Yafi, delivered a statement in Parliament regarding the new government's foreign and domestic policies. Parliament held a debate on this statement and passed a vote of confidence in the cabinet at the evening session.

Yafi stated that the foundation of the government's foreign policy would be based on the following points: Lebanon will not participate in the Baghdad Pact; refuse to join any military alliance; complete the tasks of the Arab League, and first conclude a collective security agreement among Arab countries and consolidate their economic cooperation.

Yafi said that the Lebanese government is prepared to discuss all issues of concern to other Arab governments. It will strive to achieve the unity of all Arab countries and overcome the divisions that exist between them.

Yafi said that consolidating the fraternal relations and friendship between Lebanon and Syria is one of the government's fundamental tasks. Economic negotiations between the two countries are being prepared to resume, and all obstacles in the way of concluding a bilateral military agreement between Lebanon and Syria will be eliminated. Relations with all countries will be based on the principles of friendship and mutual respect.

The statement also mentioned that Lebanon treats the national liberation movements of all countries in the world with sympathy, especially the national liberation movements in North Africa.

Yafi also emphasized that the Lebanese government firmly rejects the plan of Johnston, the special representative of the U.S. President in the Middle East, regarding the utilization of Jordan River water.

Yafi formed a cabinet on March 19th after the previous cabinet resigned.
