    Volunteer Army Officers and Soldiers Welcome the Film "Dong Cunrui"
    Our film "Dong Cunrui" and others have begun screening in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units, and this new film has been warmly welcomed by the vast number of officers and soldiers.
    When the film "Dong Cunrui" was screened in the directly subordinate organs and troops of the Volunteer Army, every screening was extremely crowded, and some people wanted to see it again after watching it two or three times. Many units of officers and soldiers held small forums after watching "Dong Cunrui." Speakers all expressed that they wanted to learn from Dong Cunrui's great patriotism and noble qualities, and his tenacity and thoroughness in completing tasks.
    Many officers and soldiers believe that "Dong Cunrui" is a successful film that has played a significant educational role. Films such as "Storm on the Southern Island," "Rage on the Sea," and "Guerrillas on the Plain" are also being shown in rotation in the Volunteer Army units at the same time as the "Dong Cunrui" film, and they are all welcomed by the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers. The officers and soldiers are pleased with the progress of the motherland's film industry. (Xinhua News Agency)

    志愿军官兵欢迎影片“董存瑞”
    我国影片“董存瑞”等已开始在中国人民志愿军部队中放映，这个新片受到广大官兵的热烈欢迎。
    当影片“董存瑞”在志愿军直属机关、部队中放映时，每场观众都非常拥挤，有的人看了两、三遍还想再看。许多单位的官兵在看过“董存瑞”后，举行了小型座谈会。发言的人都表示要学习董存瑞伟大的爱国主义精神和高贵品质，和他完成任务的顽强性和彻底性。
    许多官兵认为，“董存瑞”是一部成功的、起了很大教育作用的影片。和“董存瑞”影片同时在志愿军部队轮回放映的还有“南岛风云”、“怒海轻骑”、“平原游击队”等片，也都受到志愿军官兵们的欢迎。官兵们对祖国电影事业的进步感到高兴。（新华社）
