Xinhua News Agency, New York, 28th (TASS dispatch) - From the reports of American news agencies' Washington correspondents, it can be seen that American official sources are disregarding the positive evaluations of the Soviet-British talks by British government officials. At the same time, Washington is attempting to sow suspicion and distrust towards the Soviet policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems.

White, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, refused to comment on the results of the Soviet-British talks at a press conference. He also declined to comment on reports from London that Soviet leaders expressed their willingness to establish closer ties with the United States at a press conference.

United Press International reporters say that Washington is dissatisfied with the Soviet-British statement regarding the reduction of armed forces and armaments of the five major powers. The reporter pointed out that "it is presumed that the fifth major power refers to Communist China." As for the section of the statement concerning the development of Soviet-British trade relations, UPI said that American official sources "do not believe" that Britain can relax restrictions on East-West trade "without reaching an agreement with the United States."

    华盛顿不满苏英会谈结果
    新华社据塔斯社纽约28日讯  从美国通讯社华盛顿记者的报道里可以看到，美国官方人士无视英国政府人士对苏英会谈的好评。同时，华盛顿企图对主张社会政治制度不同的国家和平共处的苏联政策散布怀疑和不信任。
    美国国务院发言人怀特在记者招待会上拒绝就苏英会谈的结果发表评论。他也拒绝评论来自伦敦的这样的消息：苏联领导人在记者招待会上表示愿意同美国建立更加紧密的联系。
    合众社记者说，华盛顿对苏英声明谈到裁减五大国武装部队和军备感到不满。记者指出，“据推测第五个大国是指共产党中国”。至于声明中关于发展苏英贸易关系这一部分，合众社说，美国官方人士“不认为”英国“不同美国取得协议”就可以放宽东西方贸易的限制。
