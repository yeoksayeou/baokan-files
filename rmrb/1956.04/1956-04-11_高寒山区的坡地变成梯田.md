Sloping Fields in High Altitude Areas Turned into Terraces

    Since the beginning of spring, farmers of all ethnic groups in the high altitude areas of northwestern Guizhou Province have been actively turning sloping fields into terraced fields. In the four counties of Dading, Shuicheng, and Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County alone, more than 60,000 mu of sloping fields have been turned into terraced fields.

    The high altitude areas of northwestern Guizhou range from 1,400 meters to 3,000 meters above sea level. In the past, due to the high mountains and lack of water, most of the land could only be planted with crops such as buckwheat and corn, resulting in very low yields. This year, the area has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperation, and the farmers are actively building water conservancy projects, expanding the irrigated area by 300,000 mu. Under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, the farmers of Zhijin County quickly completed more than 3,300 water conservancy projects and converted 14,000 mu of sloping fields into terraced fields. Currently, the farmers are applying base fertilizer to the fields in preparation for planting rice.

    高寒山区的坡地变成梯田
    贵州省西北部高寒山区的各族农民，在入春以来积极把坡地变成梯田。仅在大定、水城和威宁彝族回族苗族自治县等四个县，就有六万多亩坡地变成了梯田。
    贵州西北高寒山区拔海一千四百公尺到三千公尺。过去由于山高缺水，绝大部分土地只能种植荞麦和玉米等作物，产量很低。今年，这个地区基本上实现了半社会主义农业合作化，农民们积极兴修水利，扩大灌溉面积三十万亩。织金县的农民在农业生产合作社的领导下，迅速修完三千三百多处水利工程后，把一万四千亩坡地改成了梯田。目前，农民们正在往田里施基肥，准备种水稻。
