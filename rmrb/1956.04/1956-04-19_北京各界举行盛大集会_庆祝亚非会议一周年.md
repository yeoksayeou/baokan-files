Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Vice Premier of the State Council, He Long, said today, "The Bandung Spirit" is advancing victoriously. The broad masses of people in the Asian-African region are determined to take their destiny into their own hands. He said this tonight at a grand rally held in Beijing to celebrate the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference.

    Referring to the recent suggestion by Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo to consider convening a second Asian-African conference at an appropriate time and in harmony with the international environment and atmosphere, He Long said, "This suggestion is welcome."

    The conference was presided over by Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. In his opening remarks, he said that the facts of the past year have proved that the Asian-African people's demand to control the destiny of their own nations and to resolutely safeguard the cause of peace has become an irresistible historical trend.

    The conference, attended by more than 1,300 people, was held in the auditorium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. After the meeting, a celebration reception filled with a friendly and joyous atmosphere and an entertainment evening were held.

    Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, radiant and full of vigor, at the reception, raised his glass to the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, India, and Burma to China, and the commercial representative of Egypt, congratulating the five Colombo countries for initiating the proposal and efforts to convene the Asian-African Conference, and wishing good health to the prime ministers of Burma, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan. Then, he raised his glass with all the diplomatic and commercial representatives of Asian and African countries in China to celebrate the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference.

    Prime Minister Zhou Enlai later toasted with the ambassadors and diplomatic officials of Romania, the Soviet Union, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Denmark, Norway, Afghanistan, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, Mongolia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the United Kingdom.

    Friends from Asian and African countries in Beijing and leaders of the International Democratic Women's Federation gathered at the reception with Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, vice ministers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and prominent figures and people from all walks of life in China, warmly discussing the increasing development of the international peace movement over the past year.

    At tonight's entertainment evening, Chinese artists performed wonderful programs from China, India, Burma, Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Many of these foreign art programs were learned during cultural exchange activities with friendly countries.

    The Opening Remarks of Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs

    Comrades, friends:

    Today is the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference. Thanks to the proposal and efforts of the five initiating countries, Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, and thanks to the support of 1.6 billion Asian and African people and peace-loving countries and people around the world, the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung, Indonesia, a year ago achieved historically significant results. At this conference, mutual understanding and friendship among Asian and African countries were established and enhanced, and the common aspirations and determination of the Asian and African people to oppose colonialism, support world peace, and promote the economic prosperity of all countries were proclaimed. The facts of the past year have proved that the Asian-African people's demand to control the destiny of their own nations and to resolutely safeguard the cause of peace has become an irresistible historical trend. The era in which foreign forces decided the fate of the Asian and African people is gone forever. The Asian and African people have achieved great victories in the struggle for peace, independence, and friendship, and will achieve even greater victories. This is worthy of our warm celebration.

    The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs has the opportunity to hold a conference here to celebrate the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference, and I would like to express my gratitude to all comrades and friends for coming to celebrate with us on behalf of the Institute of Foreign Affairs.

    北京各界举行盛大集会
    庆祝亚非会议一周年
    新华社18日讯　国务院副总理贺龙今天说：“万隆精神”在胜利地前进着。广大的亚非地区的各族人民已决心把他们的命运掌握在自己手里。这是他今晚在北京举行的一个盛大的庆祝亚非会议一周年大会上讲的。
    在谈到印度尼西亚共和国总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约最近关于建议在适当的时候，在同国际环境和气氛调和的情况下考虑召开第二次亚非会议可能性的时候，贺龙说：“这个意见是值得欢迎的。”
    大会是由中国人民外交学会会长张奚若主持。他在致开会词时说，一年以来的事实证明，亚非人民要求把自己民族的命运掌握在自己手中，坚决维护和平事业，已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。
    这个有一千三百多人参加的大会是在政协礼堂举行的。会后还举行了一个充满友好欢乐气氛的庆祝酒会和一个文娱晚会。
    容光焕发的周恩来总理在酒会上，向巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、印度、缅甸的驻华使节和埃及的商务代表，举杯祝贺五个科伦坡国家发起召开亚非会议的倡议和努力，祝贺缅甸、埃及、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦总理的身体健康。然后，他又和所有亚非国家驻中国的外交和商务代表，举杯庆贺亚非会议一周年。
    周恩来总理后来又同罗马尼亚、苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、丹麦、挪威、阿富汗、波兰、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚、蒙古、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、英国等国的驻华使节和外交官员们一起干杯。
    在京的亚非各国友人和国际民主妇联领导人，在酒会上同全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若，外交部的副部长们以及中国社会名流和各界人士，围聚一起，热烈地叙谈着这一年来国际和平运动的日益发展情况。
    在今晚的文娱晚会上，中国艺术家们演出了中国、印度、缅甸、朝鲜、蒙古、越南和印度尼西亚等国的精彩节目。其中有许多外国艺术节目是他们在同各友好国家进行文化交流活动中学来的。中国人民外交学会会长张奚若的开会词同志们、朋友们：
    今天是亚非会议一周年纪念日。由于缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦五个发起国的倡议和努力，由于十六亿亚非人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持，一年前在印度尼西亚万隆举行的亚非会议获得了具有历史意义的成就。在这个会议上，建立并增进了亚非各国间的相互了解和友谊，宣告了亚非人民反对殖民主义、拥护世界和平和促进各国经济繁荣的一致愿望和决心。一年以来的事实证明，亚非人民要求把自己民族的命运掌握在自己手中，坚决维护和平事业，已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。由外来势力来决定亚非各国人民命运的时代已经一去不复返了。亚非各国人民在争取和平、独立和友好的斗争中已经取得了伟大的胜利，并且还将取得更伟大的胜利。这是值得我们热烈庆贺的。
    中国人民外交学会有机会在这里举行庆祝亚非会议一周年的大会，并且承蒙各位同志和朋友来同我们一起庆祝，我谨代表外交学会向大家表示感谢。
