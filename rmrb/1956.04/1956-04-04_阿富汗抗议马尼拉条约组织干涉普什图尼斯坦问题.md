    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 3rd. Afghanistan formally lodged a note with the US government on April 2, protesting the Manila Treaty Organization's interference in the Pashtunistan (i.e., Pakhtunistan) issue.
    The note was delivered to the US State Department by the Afghan Ambassador to the United States, Mohammed Kabir Ludin. After delivering the note, Ludin told reporters that the Afghan government had also protested to the diplomatic representatives in Kabul of the countries of the Manila Treaty Organization.
    The communiqué issued after the recent meeting of the Manila Treaty Organization Council in Karachi stated that the governments of the member states of the organization "recognize that Pakistan's sovereignty extends to the Durand Line, the international boundary between Pakistan and Afghanistan." However, Afghanistan does not recognize the Durand Line as the boundary between Pakistan and Afghanistan, because this line was demarcated during the British rule. It divided the territory of the Afghan tribe of Pakhtuns.

    阿富汗抗议马尼拉条约组织干涉普什图尼斯坦问题
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：阿富汗在四月二日向美国政府提出了一份照会，正式抗议马尼拉条约组织干涉普什图尼斯坦（即巴克同尼斯坦）问题。
    这份照会是由阿富汗驻美国大使穆罕默德·卡比尔·卢丁递交美国国务院的。卢丁在递交照会以后对记者们说，阿富汗政府还向马尼拉条约组织各国驻喀布尔的外交代表提出了抗议。
    马尼拉条约组织理事会最近在喀喇蚩举行会议以后发表的公报说，这个组织的成员国的政府“承认巴基斯坦的主权一直伸展到巴基斯坦和阿富汗之间的国际边界杜朗线”。然而，阿富汗并不承认杜朗线是巴基斯坦和阿富汗之间的边界。因为这条线是英国统治时期中划定的。它割裂了阿富汗部落巴克同人的领土。
