Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th. Phnom Penh dispatch: According to a formal announcement from Phnom Penh on March 30th, Cambodian King Suramarit has accepted the collective resignation of the Sihanouk cabinet. Prior to this, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a communique on March 29th, confirming that Sihanouk's resignation was due to difficulties between Cambodia and other countries. The communique denied that Sihanouk's resignation was due to internal discord.

On March 29th, Sihanouk delivered a radio speech on Phnom Penh Radio, explaining the reasons for his resignation.

Sihanouk spoke about Cambodia's financial difficulties. He said, "Because I don't want to rely on foreign countries anymore, I feel it is necessary to reduce the army, from 40,000 men in 1955 to 37,000 men, and in 1956 from 37,000 men to 35,000 men. At the same time as the reduction of the army, we decided to dissolve the 2,000-man security corps in each province. By doing so, we can avoid bowing our heads to the United States for assistance. Because we have no money, we are encountering many difficulties. Now we are asking the United States for assistance, and the United States has agreed, but only willing to provide loans in Cambodian currency, not in US dollars. The Governor of the National Bank of Cambodia, Son Sann, has written to the King, asking the government not to accept Cambodian currency, but to strive for US dollars, otherwise, we will lose our independence in economic terms, and people can manipulate us as they please."

Sihanouk said that American newspapers were saying bad things about him, cursing and despising him, distorting and slandering him, even worse than the French when he demanded independence. He said that American newspapers even called him a madman.

Sihanouk also said that American newspapers used to praise him, praising his victory in the election. He said that the relationship between the United States and the Cambodian Democratic Party used to be very good, only when the Democratic Party opposed former Prime Minister Lon Nol's signing of the agreement to accept American aid did the United States come to praise him. The United States felt that he would not take the communist path, seeing that he was making every effort to oppose the communists.

Sihanouk said that the American Ambassador to Cambodia, McClintock, once told him that a Democratic Party member had recently met with him and asked the United States to aid the Democratic Party, but he threw that person out the door. He knew that he was telling him this to make him thank them and fear them. Sihanouk said that the United States hopes that he will abandon the policy of neutrality. If we abandon the policy of neutrality, we will lose India. At the Bandung Conference, we had talks with Mr. Zhou Enlai and Mr. Pham Van Dong, and we have jointly agreed to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Everyone said that they would abandon all past misunderstandings in order to cooperate with each other in a friendly manner.

He said that the United States also accused him of becoming a dictatorial Prime Minister after returning from Beijing from being a democratic Prime minister. In the past they said I was good, but I became bad just because I went to Beijing once.

Sihanouk said: "Because they despise me, I can no longer cooperate with them. If I continue to cooperate with them, I will lose my personality. Because I cannot cooperate with them, I ask my compatriots to allow me to no longer be Prime Minister."

Sihanouk concluded by saying that before resigning, he advised his compatriots to adhere to the policy of neutrality and not to stray from the path of neutrality.

    西哈努克发表广播演讲说明他辞职的原因
    新华社河内30日电　金边消息：据金边三月三十日正式宣布，柬埔寨国王苏拉玛里特已经接受了西哈努克内阁的集体辞职。在这以前，柬埔寨王国政府三月二十九日曾经发表一项公报，证实西哈努克是由于柬埔寨和其它国家之间的困难而提出辞职的。公报否认西哈努克的辞职是由于内部的不和。
    三月二十九日，西哈努克在金边电台发表广播演说，说明他辞职的原因。
    西哈努克谈到柬埔寨财政困难的情况。他说，因为我不想再依靠外国，我觉得必须裁减军队，1955年从四万人裁减到三万七千人，1956年要从三万七千人裁减到三万五千人。在裁军的同时，我们决定解散各省的两千名保安团。这样做，可以避免低头向美国求援。因为没有钱，我们遇到很多困难，现在要求美国援助，美国也同意，但只肯以柬埔寨币贷款，不愿用美元贷款。柬埔寨国家银行行长山桑已经写信给国王，要求政府不要接受柬币，要争取美元，不然，在经济方面我们就会失去独立性，人家想怎样操纵我们都可以。
    西哈努克说，美国报纸说我的坏话，咒骂和轻视我，歪曲和诬赖我，比法国在我要求独立时骂得还要厉害。他说，美国报纸还说我是个疯子。
    西哈努克又说，过去美国报纸也曾经赞扬过我，赞扬我在选举时的胜利。他说，从前美国和柬埔寨民主党的关系非常好，只是在民主党反对前首相兰涅特签订接受美国援助的协定的时候，美国才来赞扬我。美国觉得我不会走共产党那条路，看到我竭力反对共产党分子。
    西哈努克说，美国驻柬埔寨大使麦克林托克曾经告诉我，最近一个民主党党员曾经会见他，要求美国援助民主党，但是他把那个人赶出门外。我知道，他这样告诉我是要我感谢他们和害怕他们。西哈努克说，美国希望我放弃中立政策，如果放弃中立政策的话，我们将会失去印度。在万隆会议上，我们曾经和周恩来先生、范文同先生会谈，已经共同赞成和平共处的五项原则，大家都说将放弃过去彼此间的一切误解，以便互相友好合作。
    他说，美国还指责我从北京回来后，从民主首相变成了独裁首相。过去他们说我好，但是只因为去了北京一次就变成坏人了。
    西哈努克说：由于他们轻视我，我不能再和他们合作，如果我继续和他们合作的话，我就会失去人格。因为我不能和他们合作，所以我要求同胞们允许我不再当首相。
    西哈努克最后说，在我辞职之前，我劝同胞们应该坚持中立政策，不要跑出中立道路之外。
