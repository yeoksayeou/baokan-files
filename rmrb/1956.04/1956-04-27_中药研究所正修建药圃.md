    The Institute of Chinese Materia Medica is Building a Medicinal Herb Garden
    A thirty-mu piece of land in the Tianning Temple area of Beijing is being cultivated. This is where the medicinal herb garden of the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, under the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, will be established.
    The Institute of Chinese Materia Medica will systematically cultivate medicinal plants and establish specimen areas here for systematic observation and identification in the research of crude drugs. At the same time, fresh medicines needed by relevant clinical research units of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine will also be supplied.
    The Institute of Chinese Materia Medica has collected 250 kinds of medicinal plants and 111 kinds of medicinal seedlings from 18 relevant units across the country, which will be centrally transplanted into the newly built medicinal herb garden. The herb garden will also cultivate some medicinal seedlings personally excavated by the crude drug staff of the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica. In order to cooperate with the treatment of schistosomiasis and other infectious diseases that are most harmful to people's health, the herb garden will especially collect relevant medicinal plants for cultivation to meet research needs. The crude drug staff of the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica also carried out germination tests on 50 kinds of seed-type Chinese medicines purchased from medicinal material shops. The test results showed that 30% could germinate. These germinable ones will also be sown and cultivated in the herb garden.

    中药研究所正修建药圃
    北京天宁寺地区一块三十亩大的土地正在耕作。这里就是中医研究院中药研究所即将建立的药圃所在地。
    中药研究所将在这里有计划地栽培药用植物建立标本区，以供生药研究工作中的系统观察和鉴定，同时中医研究院有关临床研究单位必要应用的鲜药也将得到供应。
    中药研究所已经从全国十八个有关单位搜集到的250种药用植物和111种药苗，都将被集中移植在新建的药圃里。药圃里还将培植一部分中药研究所生药工作人员亲自采掘得来的药苗。为了配合血吸虫病和其他危害人民健康最大的传染病的治疗，药圃将特别搜集有关的药用植物加以培植，以供应研究需要。中药研究所生药工作人员还把从药材行买到的五十种种子类的中药进行了发芽试验，试验结果30％可以发芽。这些可以发芽的也将在药圃里播种培植。
