Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 6th: The World Peace Council's evening session on the 5th was chaired by Mrs. Andreen (Sweden).

	Rodney Hilton (Britain) spoke first. He pointed out that the road to peace and security is disarmament, and disarmament can be fully achieved through the implementation of agreed upon and thorough measures.

	Mrs. Arnold (Federal Republic of Germany) analyzed in detail the issue of disarmament and the reunification of Germany in her speech. She said, "We hope that Germans will reach understanding with each other, undertake the obligation of non-aggression, and not possess atomic weapons on German territory. If the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany fully undertake the obligations of disarmament agreements in the same way as countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, then these blocs will lose their meaning, and European peace will be further consolidated."

	Korneichuk (Soviet Union) pointed out in his speech that the Soviet people have always demanded, and will continue to resolutely demand, the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and the establishment of effective supervision over such a ban. The Soviet people have demanded, and will continue to demand, the cessation of the arms race, a significant reduction in armed forces and conventional armaments, up to complete disarmament. Korneichuk elaborated on the Soviet proposals regarding disarmament. He emphasized that the tasks of the international supervisory body were detailed in these proposals. He said, "We believe that the countries concerned can reach an agreement on comprehensive supervision forms that are satisfactory to all contracting parties. We also believe it is necessary for international arms sales to be supervised by agreements signed by the countries concerned within the framework of the United Nations."

	Korneichuk concluded by saying, "Our sacred duty is to issue a call from the highest podium of this meeting to the peoples of all countries and various peace-defending organizations: unite, and fight against the expansion of armaments, for disarmament, and for the restoration of trust and close cooperation between the peoples of all countries."

	Representatives from India and the People's Republic of China also spoke at the evening session.

    世界和平理事会特别会议继续举行
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩6日讯：世界和平理事会5日晚间会议由安德琳夫人（瑞典）担任主席。
    罗德尼·希尔顿（英国）首先发言。他指出，通向和平和安全的道路是裁军，而裁军是完全可以通过实行一致同意的彻底措施来达到的。
    阿诺德夫人（德意志联邦共和国）在发言中详细地分析了裁军问题和德国恢复统一的问题。她说，我们希望德国人之间彼此取得谅解，承担互不侵犯的义务和不在德国领土上拥有原子武器。如果德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国完全同参加北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约的国家一样，将承担裁军协定的义务，那么这些集团就会失去意义，欧洲和平就会更加巩固。
    考涅楚克（苏联）在发言中指出，苏联人民过去一直要求、并且今后仍将坚决要求禁止原子武器、氢武器和其它大规模毁灭性武器，并且建立对这种禁令的有效监督。苏联人民过去要求、今后仍将要求停止军备竞赛，大量缩减武装力量和常规军备，直到完全解除军备。考涅楚克详细地叙述了苏联关于裁军问题的建议。他强调指出在这次建议中详细地拟订了国际监督机构的任务。他说，我们相信有关的国家能够就缔约各国都能满意的全面监督形式达成协议。我们还认为必要的是，国际的武器买卖应当由有关国家在联合国范围内签订的协定加以监督。
    考涅楚克最后说，我们神圣的义务是从这次会议的最高的讲坛上向各国人民和各种保卫和平的组织发出号召：团结起来，为反对扩充军备、争取裁军、争取恢复世界各国人民之间的信任和紧密的合作而斗争。
    在晚间会议上发言的还有印度和中华人民共和国的代表。
