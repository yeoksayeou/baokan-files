    Serving the Construction of the Motherland's Mainland
    Zhang Tonghe, Director of the Surgical Teaching and Research Group, Northwest Medical College

    In the motherland's mainland, medical education and industrial construction were very weak before liberation, which should be attributed to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. During their rule, they never cared about medical and health work. Taking Xi'an as an example, there were only a few hospitals, and these hospitals mainly served the Kuomintang reactionaries. It was difficult for ordinary people to be hospitalized for treatment when they fell ill. I remember when I was in Xi'an, I had an appendectomy in a dark little house, and there was no equipment to speak of. I was constantly worried about the safety of patients after surgery. The medical conditions in the remote rural areas and pastoral areas of ethnic minorities were even worse. Therefore, the people there were constantly threatened by various diseases and could lose their lives at any time. Therefore, after liberation, it was an urgent matter to develop medical and health work in the Northwest. However, I did not realize this in the past and always thought that the working conditions here were not good and asked to work in the capital. However, with the development of the country's construction, my thinking began to change because I saw the new changes in the Northwest. Here, construction has begun everywhere, whether it is in pastoral areas, agricultural areas, or remote mountainous areas. Especially after the start of the country's first five-year plan, I personally witnessed the construction in the Xi'an area develop like mushrooms after rain, and the face of Xi'an has become unrecognizable. In the suburbs, factories and schools have been built one after another. The narrow path you saw yesterday has become a wide road today. What you saw yesterday was still a field, but today you see workers starting to build sheds, trucks transporting building materials in a constant stream, and after a while, new buildings emerge from the dense scaffolding. Take our college as an example, many buildings are newly built, and the equipment inside is also new. Our operating room is a modern operating room. I feel very excited every time I walk into the operating room. Now I will never ask to leave here again. I want to stay as a fighter for the construction of the mainland, serving the people who are building the mainland, training more doctors for them, and protecting their health so that they can carry out construction smoothly.

    With the support of this kind of thinking, I feel that I have become younger and more energetic. Therefore, there has also been a great change in the work I have undertaken. In the past, I did not care about the leadership work of the teaching and research group. What I paid attention to was business. I thought I was a professor of surgery, and what I should pay attention to was the research work of academic thought. As for the administrative leadership and ideological leadership of the teaching and research group, that was someone else's business. Therefore, the work of the teaching and research group could not be carried out for a long time in the past, and the staff also had many opinions. Later, with the help of the Party, I began to learn how to lead the work of a department. I began to care about the staff of the teaching and research group, and I tried to integrate with them and discuss things with them more. With everyone working together and working actively, the work of the teaching and research group has changed and achieved certain results. Of course, there are still many shortcomings in the work.

    I feel that the greatest achievements in my 27 years of medical teaching work have been in these past few years. In the more than 20 years before liberation, only one million words of surgical reference books were translated, while in the short few years after liberation, more than one million words of surgical general theory and neurosurgery translations have been completed. From here, we can see the changes of an old intellectual after liberation.

    Of course, this change is inseparable from the Party's training of me and the influence of Soviet advanced science. I actively participated in the study of Pavlov's theory and criticized the medical views of the British and American bourgeoisie. In order to be able to directly read the original Soviet medical books, I also learned Russian, and now I am working with several comrades in the teaching and research group to translate a Soviet book on neurosurgery. Especially when I studied with the famous Soviet neurosurgeon Yarutunov, I realized more deeply the advanced medical science of the Soviet Union. During the months of study, not only did my professional ability improve, but more importantly, I saw in Comrade Yarutunov the noble qualities of Soviet scientists serving the people. Even now, I still seem to hear Comrade Yarutunov say to us: "How happy it is for a person to work for the future and for future generations!" "A teacher who can let his students surpass himself is a true teacher." These words are deeply imprinted in my heart. I am working hard according to what he said. I remember that Comrade Yarutunov said this when he gave us the last lesson: "My lectures are just giving you some seeds of knowledge. Whether these seeds can grow depends on your efforts. I sincerely hope to come back to lecture you again. At that time, I hope that these seeds have already grown and are bearing fruit." I can assure Comrade Yarutunov that these seeds have begun to sprout and will surely blossom and bear fruit. I will always grow in the mainland of the motherland, and blossom and bear fruit in the mainland of the motherland.

    The medical teaching work in the mainland, like other construction undertakings in the mainland, has no foundation at all and needs to be started from scratch. In order to carry out the medical teaching work in the mainland well, I hope to launch a movement to support the construction of the mainland among medical personnel, and I also hope that medical schools can be added in the mainland - such as schools for training clinical neurosurgeons. Because the construction undertakings in the mainland are developing day by day, and the number of people engaged in construction undertakings is also increasing day by day, they urgently need our medical staff to protect their health during construction.

### 为祖国内地建设事业服务

    为祖国内地建设事业服务
    西北医学院外科教研组主任　张同和
    在祖国的内地，解放以前的医疗教学工作和工业建设一样，是非常薄弱的。这应该归罪于国民党的反动统治，在他们统治时期，他们从未关心过医疗卫生工作。就以西安市为例，也只有少数的几所医院，而这些医院主要是为国民党反动派服务的。一般人生了病，就很难住院治疗。记得那时候我在西安，曾在一个黑暗的小房子里动阑尾炎手术，根本谈不上有什么设备。成天为病人在动手术后的安全耽心。至于那偏僻的农村和少数民族的牧区的医疗条件，就更糟糕了。所以那里的人民时时刻刻在受着各种疾病的威胁，说不定什么时候送掉性命。因此在解放以后，开展西北的医疗卫生工作是迫不及待的问题。然而，我在过去没有认识到这点，总认为这里工作条件不好，要求到首都去工作。但是，随着国家建设事业的发展，我这种思想开始转变了。因为我看到了西北地区的新的变化。在这里，不管是牧区、农业区和偏僻的山区，到处都开始了建设。特别是当国家第一个五年计划开始以后，我亲眼看到西安地区的建设事业，像雨后春笋一样发展起来，西安市的面貌变得使人将要认不出来了。在郊区，一座一座的工厂和学校建立起来了。你昨天所看到的羊肠小道，今天就成了宽大的公路。昨天你看到的还是一片田野，今天就看到工人开始搭工棚，汽车川流不息地运输建筑材料，再过些时候看，新的楼房就在稠密的脚手架里钻出来了。就说我们的学院吧，很多楼房都是新建的，里边的设备也都是新的。我们的手术室是一座有着近代化设备的手术室。每当我走进手术室的时候就觉得很兴奋。现在我再也不会要求离开这里了。我要作为一个建设内地的战士留下来，为那些建设内地的人民服务，为他们培养更多的医生，保护他们的身体健康，使他们能够顺利地进行建设。
    在这种思想的支持下，我觉得自己变得年青了，有力量了。因此，我所担任的工作也有了很大的转变。过去我对教研组的领导工作是不关心的。我注意的是业务，我认为自己是一个外科教授，所注意的应该是学术思想的研究工作，至于教研组的行政领导和思想领导，那是别人的事情。因此教研组的工作在过去很长时间内开展不起来，工作人员也有不少的意见。后来，在党的帮助下，我就开始学习怎样领导一个部门的工作方法。我开始关心教研组的工作人员，努力和他们打成一片，遇事和他们多商量。在大家互相团结，积极工作的情况下，教研组的工作有了转变，也有了一定的成绩，当然，工作中仍有不少缺点。
    我感到在我从事医疗教学工作二十七年以来，工作成绩最大的要算这几年了。解放前二十多年只翻译了一百万字外科方面的参考书，而在解放后这短短的几年内，就完成了一百多万字的外科总论和神经外科学的译著。从这里可以看出一个旧的知识分子在解放后的变化。
    当然，这种转变是和党对我的培养以及苏联先进科学的影响分不开的。我积极参加了巴甫洛夫学说的学习，并对英美资产阶级的医学观点进行了批判。为了能够直接读到苏联原版本的医学书籍，我还学会了俄文，现在正在和教研组的几位同志共同翻译一本苏联神经外科方面的书籍。特别是在向苏联著名的神经外科专家亚鲁秋诺夫同志学习的时候，使我更深刻地认识了苏联的先进的医疗科学。在几个月的学习时间内，不仅提高了我的业务能力，更主要的是，我从亚鲁秋诺夫同志身上看到苏联科学家那种为人民服务的高贵的品质。直到现在，我还好像经常听到亚鲁秋诺夫同志曾经向我们说过的话：“一个人为着将来，为着后代工作，该是多么幸福呀！”“一个能让学生超过自己的教师，才是真正的教师。”这些话深深地印在我的心里。我正努力按照他所说的话工作。我记得亚鲁秋诺夫同志在给我们讲最后一次课的时候，曾经说过这样的话：“我的讲课只是给你们一些知识的种子，这些种子能不能成长，在于你们的努力。我深切地希望能够再次回来给你们讲课，那时我盼望这些种子都已经成长起来，并且开花结果。”我可以向亚鲁秋诺夫同志保证，这些种子已经开始发芽了，并且一定能够开花结果。我会永远生长在祖国的内地，在祖国的内地开花结果。
    内地的医疗教学工作，像内地的其他各种建设事业一样，一点基础也没有，需要从头做起。为了能够很好地开展内地的医疗教学工作，我希望能够在医务人员中发动一个支援内地建设的运动，还希望在内地能够增设医科学校——像训练临床神经外科医师的学校等。因为内地的建设事业一天比一天发展，从事建设事业的人也一天比一天地增多起来，他们迫切需要我们医务人员来保护他们在建设中的身体健康。
