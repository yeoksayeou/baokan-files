Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 21st: At the meeting of the Vietnam Central Joint Armistice Commission on April 19th, Phan Trong Tue, Chief Delegate of the Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, raised the issue of the responsibility of the General Command of the French Union Forces to continue fulfilling the Geneva Accords and demanded that the Delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces express its position on this issue.

After pointing out the responsibilities of the French government and the South Vietnamese regime to fulfill the Geneva Accords, Phan Trong Tue stated that the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army believes that regardless of whether French troops remain in South Vietnam or withdraw from South Vietnam, the French government and the South Vietnamese regime must be responsible for fully fulfilling all of the Geneva Accords.

The Delegation of the French Union Forces, still using the excuse of not having received "instructions from the General Command," refused to express its position.

Phan Trong Tue demanded that the General Command of the French Union Forces express a clear position on this important issue as soon as possible.

    越方要求法方对履行日内瓦协定责任问题表明态度
    新华社河内21日电  越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表潘重慧少将在四月十九日的越南中央联合停战委员会会议上，提出了关于法兰西联邦部队总司令部继续履行日内瓦协定的责任问题，并且要求法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团对这个问题表示态度。
    潘重慧少将在指出了法国政府和南越政权对履行日内瓦协定的责任以后说，越南人民军总司令部认为，不管法国军队留在南越或者撤离南越，法国政府和南越政权都要负责充分履行全部日内瓦协定。
    法兰西联邦部队代表团仍然借口没有接到“总司令部的指示”，不肯表明态度。
    潘重慧少将要求法兰西联邦部队总司令部对这一个重要问题早日表示明确的态度。
