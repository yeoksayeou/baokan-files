    Effective and Practical Leadership
    By our reporter Liu Fan
    After Zhuji County in Zhejiang Province achieved agricultural collectivization in January of this year, it concentrated its efforts on spring plowing preparations. By the end of March, the county's water conservancy projects had exceeded the original plan by 60%, ensuring that 450,000 mu of fields had a water source for 35 to 50 days, and 80,000 mu of fields could be free from or reduce the impact of waterlogging. The county accumulated 174.12 million dan of soil fertilizer, pressed 12 million dan of green manure, and prepared 3 million jin of various chemical fertilizers. The county also completed pest control on 260,000 mu of fields and prepared 1.4 million jin of improved early and late rice varieties suitable for changing the farming system. This laid the foundation for the county to grow double-cropping rice on 80% of its fields this year and increase grain production by more than 121.46 million jin compared to last year. By early April, all 1,010 cooperatives in the county had engaged in spring plowing production activities such as sowing, cultivating strong seedlings, and plowing paddy fields. More than 500 cooperatives in the six districts of Zidong, Pai Tou, etc., on both sides of the Puyang River, which runs through the county, have completed sowing.
    The key to Zhuji County's success in spring plowing preparation and production lies in the fact that the county party committee began to overcome its general leadership style and strengthened its specific leadership over agricultural production.
    How did the county party committee change its leadership style and carry out specific leadership? After the Jinhua Prefectural Committee held a spring plowing production mobilization meeting in late January, the county committee held a meeting to review and analyze the county's preparatory production situation. It found that many cadres in the county did not sufficiently recognize the difficulties in completing this year's huge production increase target, and were satisfied with last winter's production achievements, or mistakenly believed that farmers would increase production even without leadership after joining cooperatives, saying "the boat will naturally straighten when it reaches the bridge, no need to worry." As a result, cadres generally did not go deep into the grassroots level and did not help cooperatives solve problems specifically, leading to a serious situation in some areas where water conservancy was not repaired and soil fertilizer was not accumulated. The county committee criticized this leadership style. The county committee pointed out that if this generalized leadership style is not changed, and if the county's production is not given specific and in-depth leadership, this year's production increase target is in danger of falling through. At the same time, the county committee made specific arrangements for the county's main production activities. And according to the tightness of the production activities, other work was also arranged appropriately, and a phased work plan for the county was formulated. The county committee also determined that the main focus of these tasks should be on three key links: building water conservancy, launching a fertilizer accumulation campaign, and learning the technology of double-cropping rice cultivation.
    After the county committee made specific arrangements for spring plowing production, the county committee members went to the cooperatives to conduct specific leadership, discovered and solved problems in a timely manner, and summarized and promoted experiences in a timely manner. After Sun Zifu, the secretary of the county party committee, arrived in Xinmin Township, he immediately discovered the false phenomena in the preparatory work. Originally, it was said that the water conservancy projects completed in Xinmin Township could irrigate for 40 to 50 days. After Sun Zifu's in-depth visits, he found that the water storage capacity of the water conservancy projects built was only enough to irrigate for about 30 days, which was half of the county committee's required drought resistance capacity. After discovering this problem, Sun Zifu helped the township branch re-mobilize the masses to build reservoirs, increasing the township's drought resistance capacity to irrigate for 60 days. The county committee reported this matter to the whole county, pointing out that party organizations at all levels must go deep down to discover and solve problems in order to ensure the completion of this year's production increase target. Subsequently, the district committee secretaries of the county's twelve districts and the general branch secretaries of the thirty-six townships consciously went to the cooperatives to help solve problems. For example, Ge Ruosong, the deputy secretary of the Daxi District Committee, found that the progress of the Dayuan Reservoir project in Cifeng Township was very slow. The original plan was to complete it with 4,000 workdays, but 3,500 workdays had already been spent, and 2,000 more workdays were needed to complete it. Why was it so slow? After Ge Ruosong's in-depth understanding, he found that the key to the problem was that the scoring method used was based on daily scoring, rather than scoring based on the amount done each day, which could not stimulate everyone's labor enthusiasm, so the labor efficiency was very low. In order to help solve this problem, Ge Ruosong divided eight earthworks on the construction site and found ten cooperative members to carry earthworks. According to the situation of carrying earthworks, it was calculated that each labor force carrying two and a half squares was 10 points. The next day, the method of contracting squares for payment was implemented on the construction site. Ge Ruosong also studied and determined the standard for compacting soil with cooperative members and cadres. This greatly improved the labor enthusiasm of the masses, and the efficiency of carrying and compacting soil was increased by half compared to before. Doing so not only helped the cadres below solve the current problems in production, but also improved the working ability of the cadres below.
    The change in the leadership style of the Zhuji County Party Committee is also reflected in its ability to grasp the most important problems and the weakest links to carry out work. First of all, in the spring plowing preparation work, the county party committee found that the production increase targets of many cooperatives were too high, or there were too few specific measures; some cooperatives could not reach them at all; and this overly high target had already affected the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. For example, the Shangcai Cooperative in Chencai Township, Chencai District, had low production enthusiasm among its members due to the overly high production increase target. Only 43% of the fertilizer accumulation plan was completed in early March. The masses believed that: it is impossible to complete the plan even if we work to death, why bother to spend a lot of effort. The county committee believed that this was a big problem, so it cooperated with the township branch to help the cooperative appropriately revise the production increase target. The enthusiasm of the members of these cooperatives immediately rose. Second, in early March, the county party committee also grasped the two weak links of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. At that time, only 60% of the planned water conservancy projects had been completed. An important reason for the slow progress of water conservancy projects was that the tasks of water conservancy projects were distributed very unevenly in various regions. Generally speaking, the tasks in the lake area were heavier, followed by the Ban area, and the mountain area was lighter. According to this situation, the county party committee transferred 8,000 laborers from the Ban area to support the lake area, which accelerated the progress of water conservancy projects. At that time, most cooperatives were still short of 30% to 50% of fertilizer. The county party committee mobilized the masses to interplant green manure in 63,000 mu of spring flower fields, and came up with several other methods of accumulating fertilizer, which basically solved the problem of insufficient fertilizer sources. Third, the county party committee believed that this year's production increase task was very large, and it was necessary to ensure the supply of agricultural production materials. Therefore, the county party committee seized the opportunity to organize various relevant departments to serve spring production. For example, the supply and marketing and handicraft departments organized more than 5,500 handicraft workers to go to the countryside to repair and newly manufacture more than 40,000 pieces of agricultural tools for the cooperatives; the financial departments successively provided loans of more than 1.3 million yuan to help 715 cooperatives solve the problem of insufficient funds in water conservancy and the purchase of chemical fertilizers; the cooperative departments promptly promoted 1,070 double-wheel double-share plows; the grain departments transferred and organized cooperatives to exchange more than 300,000 jin of improved varieties; the food company actively purchased more than 20 heads of draft cattle to support the lake area. The active cooperation of these departments played a significant role in promoting the completion of preparatory work.
    Finally, the county party committee also emphasized the problem of cadres learning agricultural production knowledge and agricultural technology. During spring production, the county party committee secretary, county party committee members, district party committee members, and 1,100 rural work cadres generally learned the technology and experience of planting double-cropping rice; they also organized district party committee secretaries to visit and learn the operating methods of accumulating compost on the spot. In order to ensure the completion of the agricultural production increase task, the county committee required county committee members and members of party organizations at all levels to learn advanced agricultural production technologies this year, so as to lead agricultural production more practically and effectively.

    切实有效的领导
    本报记者  刘凡
    浙江省诸暨县在今年一月实现了农业合作化以后，就集中力量进行春耕准备工作。到三月底，全县水利工程已超过原定计划的60％，保证了四十五万亩田有三十五天至五十天的水源，八万亩田能免除或减轻涝灾。全县积土肥17，412万担，压绿肥1，200万担，并准备了各种化学肥料三百万斤。全县还完成了二十六万亩田的除虫工作，准备了一百四十万斤适应改变耕作制度的早稻和晚稻良种。这就为今年全县在80％的田里改种双季稻，为今年全县比去年增产12，146万多斤粮食打下了基础。到四月上旬，全县1，010个合作社投入了播种、培育壮秧、翻耕水田等春耕生产活动。横贯该县的浦阳江两岸紫东、牌头等六个区500多个合作社已经完成了播种工作。
    诸暨县的春耕准备工作和春耕生产所以能够取得这样大的成绩，关键在于县委开始克服了一般化的领导作风，加强了对农业生产的具体领导。
    县委怎样改变领导作风，进行具体领导的呢？今年一月下旬，金华地委开过春耕生产动员大会以后，县委会开会检查和分析了全县备耕生产情况，发现全县不少干部对完成今年巨大的增产任务的困难认识不足，而满足于去年冬季的生产成绩，或者错误地认为农民入了合作社，不去领导也能增产，说“船到桥头自会直，不用担心”。因此，干部普遍不深入下层，不帮助合作社具体地解决问题，以致不少地区一度发生了不修水利不积土肥的严重情况。县委会批判了这种领导作风。县委会指出：如果不改变这种一般化的领导作风，如果不对全县的生产进行具体深入的领导，今年的增产任务就有落空的危险。同时，县委把全县的主要生产活动，作了具体的安排。并且根据生产活动的松紧，把其它工作都作了确当的安排，制定了全县分段的工作计划。县委同时又确定在这些工作中主要抓紧三个环节：兴修水利、开展积肥运动、学习种双季连作稻技术。
    县委会对春耕生产作了具体安排以后，县委委员就分头深入合作社进行具体领导，及时发现和解决问题，及时总结和推广经验。县委书记孙子甫到新民乡以后，立即发现了备耕工作中的虚假现象。原来说新民乡完成的水利工程能灌溉四十天至五十天，孙子甫深入访问以后，发现兴修的水利工程蓄水量仅够灌溉三十天左右，距县委要求的抗旱能力还差一倍。孙子甫发现这个问题以后，就帮助乡支部重新动员群众兴建水库，把全乡的抗旱能力提高到能灌溉到六十天。县委会把这件事向全县作了通报，指出各级党组织必须深入下去发现和解决问题，才能保证今年增产任务的完成。接着全县十二个区的区委书记和三十六个乡的乡总支书记都自觉地深入合作社去帮助解决问题了。如大西区区委副书记葛若松到次峰乡发现大源水库工程进展很慢，原计划四千个工可以修好，已经花了三千五百个工，还需二千个工才能完成。为什么这样慢呢？葛若松经过深入了解以后，找出了问题的关键在于采用的评分方法是按日评分，而不是按照每天做的多少来评分，不能激发大家的劳动积极性，因此劳动效率很低。葛若松为了帮助解决这个问题，就在工地上划出八个土方，找了十个社员来挑土方，根据挑土方的情况计算出每个劳动力挑二方半为十分，第二天工地上实行包方计酬的办法。葛若松又同社员和干部研究确定了夯土的标准。这就大大提高了群众的劳动积极性，挑土和夯土的效率都比以前提高半倍。这样做，不仅帮助下面的干部解决了当前生产中的问题，同时也提高了下面干部的工作能力。
    诸暨县委领导作风的转变还表现在善于抓住最主要的问题和最薄弱的环节进行工作。首先，在春耕准备工作中，县委发现不少合作社的增产指标太高，或者具体措施太少；有些合作社根本无法达到；而且这种指标过高的计划已经影响到社员的生产积极性。比如陈蔡区陈蔡乡上蔡合作社由于增产指标过高，社员生产劲头不大，三月上旬只完成积肥计划的43％。群众认为：干死了也完不成计划，何必花大劲。县委认为这是一个大问题，就协同乡支部帮助合作社适当地修订了增产指标。这些合作社社员的积极性马上高涨起来了。第二，三月上旬县委又抓水利和积肥两个薄弱环节。当时水利只完成计划数的60％。水利工程进展较慢的一个重要原因，是各个地区水利工程的任务分配得很不平衡。一般地说，湖区的任务较重，坂区次之，山区较轻。根据这种情况，县委从坂区抽调了八千个劳动力支援湖区，这就加快了水利工程的进展。当时，一般合作社还缺百分之三十至五十的肥料，县委就发动群众在六万三千亩春花田里套种了绿肥，并且想出了其他几种积肥的办法，基本上解决了肥源不足的问题。第三，县委认为今年的增产任务很大，必须保证作好对农村生产资料的供应工作。因此，县委就抓紧组织各个有关部门为春季生产服务。如供销、手工业部门组织了五千五百多个手工业工人下乡，为合作社修补和新制了四万多件农具；金融部门先后贷款一百三十多万元，帮助715个合作社解决在水利和购买化学肥料方面的资金不足的困难；合作部门及时推销双轮双铧犁1，070部；粮食部门调运和组织合作社互换良种三十多万斤；食品公司积极地采购了二十多头耕牛支援湖区。这些部门积极地配合，对完成备耕起了显著的推动作用。
    最后，县委还特别强调了干部必须学习农业生产知识和农业技术的问题。春季生产中，县委书记、县委委员、区委委员和一千一百个农村工作干部普遍学习了种双季连作稻的技术和经验；还组织区委书记实地参观和学习了积堆肥的操作方法。为了保证完成农业增产任务，县委会要求县委委员和各级党组织的成员在今年内要学会农业生产中的先进技术，以便更切实更有效地领导农业生产。
