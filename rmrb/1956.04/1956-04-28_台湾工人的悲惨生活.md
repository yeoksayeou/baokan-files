	The "Labor Insurance Monthly Report" from Taiwan reveals that out of every 10,000 workers in Taiwan, 590 die, are disabled, or suffer serious injuries each year due to various industrial accidents. According to the statistics in this monthly report, in 1955, among the 225,000 workers in Taiwan participating in the so-called "labor insurance," a total of 13,300 were seriously injured, disabled, or killed in accidents. From March 1950 to the end of 1955, 49,365 workers in Taiwan were injured or killed in industrial accidents. This figure does not include the large number of workers who did not participate in the so-called "labor insurance."

	The reason for the large number of worker deaths and injuries is the lack of safety equipment in Taiwan's factories and mines. Most of these factories and mines are operated by the Chiang gang's bureaucratic capital. The Taiwan "Industrial and Mining Inspection Committee" inspected 1,335 factories, and only 89 had qualified safety equipment; the remaining 1,200+ were unqualified.

	A Taiwanese magazine said that Taiwan's coal mine pits are very short and narrow. In some mine pits, workers have to lie down and crawl on all fours to work. Coal miners attach carbide lamps to their foreheads, lie on their sides in the pits, and dig the coal piece by piece with shovels. Then, haulage workers manually load the coal into baskets, tie them to their backs with ropes, crawl on all fours to the pit entrance, and then load them into coal cars to be transported out.

	Taiwanese coal miners have to work ten to twelve hours a day in the mine pits. Because they rarely see the sun throughout the year, and their wages are low, lacking nutrition, their bodies quickly break down. Many people suffer from lung diseases and various other occupational diseases, and the mortality rate is very high.

	Taiwan's coal mines generally lack safety equipment, and various accidents occur frequently in the mine pits. In 1955, more than 3,100 coal miners were injured or killed in accidents.

	The wages of Taiwanese coal miners have not increased for a long time, while prices are rising every day. Currently, the average miner's monthly wage is about 300 New Taiwan Dollars, and after being deducted by the foremen, what remains is only enough for personal living. Workers with wives and children often suffer from hunger. Taiwanese coal miners are also often owed wages for long periods by the capitalists. Taiwanese newspapers said that as of January this year, each worker was owed an average of one and a half months' wages. To maintain their livelihoods, miners who are owed wages pawned and mortgaged their wage slips to usurers at 60% of their value.

    台湾工人的悲惨生活
    台湾每一万个工人中，每年有五百九十人因各种工伤事故而死亡、残废或受重伤，这是台湾“劳工保险月报”透露的数字。根据这个月报的统计，在1955年，台湾参加所谓“劳工保险”的二十二万五千名工人中，共有一万三千三百人因事故而重伤、残废和死亡。从1950年3月到1955年底，台湾因工伤事故伤亡的工人达49，365人，这个数字不包括大批没有参加所谓“劳工保险”的工人在内。
    造成大批工人因事故死伤的原因，是台湾的工厂、矿场缺乏安全设备。这些工厂、矿场大部分为蒋帮官僚资本所经营。台湾“工矿检查委员会”曾经检查1，335家工厂，安全设备合格的只有八十九家，其余一千二百多家都不合格。
    台湾一家杂志说，台湾的煤矿坑都很矮细。在一些矿坑内，工人工作时要卧倒和用四肢爬行，掘煤工人把电石灯顶在额上，侧身卧在坑洞中，用铁锹把煤一块一块地掘下，然后由提运工人用手把煤块装入筐内，用绳系在背上，四肢着地爬行到坑口，再装入煤车中运出。
    台湾煤矿工人每天要在矿坑中工作十小时到十二小时，由于终年少见太阳，而且工资低微，缺乏营养，因此很快就把身体弄坏，许多人都患了肺病和其他各种职业病，死亡率很高。
    台湾的煤矿普遍缺乏安全设备，矿坑中各种事故经常发生。在1955年因事故死伤的煤矿工人有三千一百多人。
    台湾煤矿工人的工资长期没有增加，而物价天天上涨。目前，一般矿工每月工资约伪台币三百元，除了被包工头刻扣外，剩下来的仅够个人生活，有妻子儿女的工人，经常挨饥受饿。台湾煤矿工人还常常被资方长期积欠工资。台湾报纸说，到今年一月间，平均每个工人被积欠了一个半月工资。为了维持生活，被积欠工资的矿工把工资提领单以六成的价格，向高利贷者典当和抵押。
