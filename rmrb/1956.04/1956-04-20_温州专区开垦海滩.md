Wenzhou Prefecture Reclaims Beaches

The beaches along the coast of Wenzhou Prefecture are formed by long-term alluvial deposits of seawater and mud, with large stretches of beaches extending into the sea every year.

Wenzhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, is now making overall plans to reclaim more than 130,000 mu of coastal beaches. It is planned to carry out large-scale reclamation work on more than 68,000 mu of beaches in five counties, including Wenling, Huangyan, and Yuhuan, this year. At present, more than 27,000 farmers are working intensively on dike construction. In two or three years, these beaches will become green farmland, and animal husbandry and fisheries will be developed accordingly.

    温州专区开垦海滩
    温州专区沿海的海滩是海水淤泥长期冲积形成的，每年都有大片海滩向海面伸展。
    浙江省温州专区现在做出全面规划，开垦沿海的十三万多亩海滩。计划今年在温岭、黄岩、玉环等五个县的六万八千多亩海滩上进行大规模的开垦工作。目前，二万七千多名农民正在紧张地进行围塘工作。二、三年后，这些海滩将成为绿油油的庄稼地，并可相应地发展畜牧业、渔业等。
