Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 3rd: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference on April 2nd that unless the International Commission in Vietnam is given the power to work freely according to the Geneva Accords, it cannot continue to exist there.

Nehru said, "As far as South Vietnam is concerned, the attitude of the government there has put the International Commission in an extremely difficult position. The International Commission went there because of the Geneva Accords. It went there for no other reason. It works according to the Geneva Accords.

"The South Vietnamese government has not accepted the obligations stipulated in this agreement, because they said that they did not sign the agreement at all. They were not an independent government at that time. The French government signed the agreement, and then the South Vietnamese government became the successor to the French government.

"The South Vietnamese government happily accepted all the benefits derived from the Geneva Accords. They only opposed assuming the obligations. Basically, that's the situation."

The Indian Prime Minister then said: "We are not trying to evade our responsibility (as chairman), because we know that if the International Commission leaves there, the Geneva Accords will be undermined, and conflict may subsequently occur there. We do not want conflict to occur, no one wants conflict to occur, but unless we can have some power to work and be respected to some extent, we will not work there again."

Referring to what he said earlier in the People's House about South Vietnam possibly cooperating with the International Commission a little, Nehru said: "I said there are some signs that they may accept the obligations. That's all I said. We are currently waiting for the meeting between Chairman Lloyd and Molotov, because the issue has been raised with them."

At the same time, Nehru praised the neutral policy adopted by former Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk.
He said that a "very peculiar" situation had emerged in Cambodia.

Nehru said, "Prince Sihanouk has resigned as Prime Minister. I don't need to say much about this, because he has held many press conferences in which he explained why he resigned and how his borders on both sides, namely South Vietnam and Thailand, have exerted great pressure on him. All I can say is that I sympathize with Prince Sihanouk on this matter. I think that in the past year or two, that is, after the Geneva Conference, he has led his country quite successfully under very difficult conditions. He has particularly adhered to the basic concept of the Geneva Accords, that the Indochinese countries should remain independent and should not ally themselves with any major power bloc. Otherwise, one does this, and the other does that, which will make Indochina a battleground for the policies of major powers, with one idea prevailing over another."

A reporter asked if some people think that it is okay for large countries like India to adopt an independent or neutral policy, but not for small countries. Is there some truth to this view?

Nehru said that it should be assumed that small countries can especially benefit from such a policy. In any case, large countries can take care of themselves. In Europe, small countries like Switzerland have consistently maintained neutrality for a long time and have benefited from it. This is a good example.

Nehru believes that the situation in Indochina is such that powerful forces outside Indochina are in conflict in Indochina. The only way to avoid this situation is for Indochina to remain neutral, so that neither side of the great powers needs to fear that it will be used against them.

### 尼赫鲁总理谈印度支那局势

    尼赫鲁总理谈印度支那局势
    新华社新德里3日电　印度总理尼赫鲁四月二日在记者招待会上说，除非根据日内瓦协定给予越南国际委员会以自由进行工作的权力，否则它是不能在那里继续存在下去的。
    尼赫鲁说：“就南越而论，那里的政府的态度已经使得国际委员会陷于极端困难的境地。国际委员会是因为日内瓦协定才到那里去的。它到那里去是没有其他任何原因的。它根据日内瓦协定进行工作。
      “南越政府没有接受这个协定所规定的义务，因为他们说，他们根本没有签订这项协定。他们在当时并不是独立的政府。法国政府签订了这项协定，接着，南越政府成为接替法国政府的国家。
      “南越政府愉快地接受了从日内瓦协定中所得到的一切好处。他们只是反对承担义务。基本上，情况就是这样的。”
    印度总理接着说：“我们并不是想要逃避我们（作为主席）的责任，因为我们知道，如果国际委员会离开了那里，日内瓦协定就会遭到破坏，随后在那里就可能发生冲突。我们并不希望发生冲突，谁都不希望发生冲突，但是除非我们能够拥有某种权力来进行工作，并且受到某种尊重，否则我们是不会再在那里工作下去的。”
    尼赫鲁谈到早些时候他在人民院所说的南越可能同国际委员会合作一点的时候说：“我说的是：有一些迹象表明他们可能接受义务。我所说的仅仅是这些。我们目前等待劳埃德和莫洛托夫这两位主席举行会谈，因为已经把这个问题向他们提出了。”
    同时，尼赫鲁称赞前柬埔寨首相西哈努克所采取的中立政策。
  他说，柬埔寨出现了“非常奇特”的局面。
    尼赫鲁说，“首相西哈努克亲王已经辞职。我对这件事不需要说很多的话，因为他已经举行过好多次记者招待会，在会上说明了他为什么辞职，以及他的国境两边，即南越方面和泰国方面如何对他施加巨大压力。我所能说的只有是，我在这件事情上是同情西哈努克亲王的。我认为，在过去一两年中，也就是在日内瓦会议后，他在非常困难的条件下相当成功地领导着他的国家。他特别遵守日内瓦协定的基本概念，就是印度支那各国应当保持独立，不应当同任何大国集团结盟。否则，一个这样做，另一个则那样做，这样就将使印度支那成为大国政策的角逐场，这一个想法胜过另一个。”
    有记者问道，有些人认为，像印度那样的大国采取独立的或是中立的政策，那是无妨的，但是小国就不是那样。这种意见是否有些道理。
    尼赫鲁说，应当设想小国特别可以从这种政策中得到好处。无论如何，大国能够照顾自己。在欧洲，像瑞士那样的小国很长时期以来一贯保持中立，并且从中得到好处。这是很好的例子。
    尼赫鲁认为，印度支那的局势是这样一种局势：印度支那以外的强大的力量在印度支那发生冲突。要避免这种局势的唯一方法就是印度支那保持中立，这样一来，巨大的力量双方都用不着害怕它被利用来反对它们。
