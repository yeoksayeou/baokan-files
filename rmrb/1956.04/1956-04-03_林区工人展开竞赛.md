Workers in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have 95% of its employees participating in the socialist competition. Many areas are constantly breaking quotas in major work types such as felling, skidding, peeling, transporting, loading and unloading, and sawing. The Yituli River tractor skidding team has completed its March task thirteen days ahead of schedule. The Tuli River Motor Transport Workshop had exceeded the first quarter plan by 9% on March 17. After promoting the experience of 100,000 kilometers without major repairs, they saved 3,562 kilograms of grease in two or three days. The Arshan Logging Yard increased production efficiency by 50% due to the promotion of automatic sleds.

Through the competition, the work of the departments has been improved. Many people have put forward the slogan "Finish today's work today".

    林区工人展开竞赛
    内蒙古自治区大兴安岭林区已有95％的职工参加了社会主义竞赛。许多地区在采伐、集材、剥皮、搬运、装卸、制材等主要工种中不断突破定额。伊图里河拖拉机集材队已提前十三天完成三月份任务。图里河机运车间已在三月十七日超额9％完成第一季度计划，他们在推行十万公里无大修的经验后，两、三天就节约了油脂3，562公斤。阿尔山采木场由于推广了自动爬犁，生产效率提高50％。
    通过竞赛，改进了科室工作。许多人提出了“当天事当天完”的口号。
