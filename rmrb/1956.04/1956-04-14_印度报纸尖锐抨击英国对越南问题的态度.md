Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 13th: The British government's reply to the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue has provoked sharp criticism in India. A report in the "Times of India" on the 12th stated that the British attitude towards the Vietnam elections "greatly surprised the Indian government." The newspaper said, "From India's point of view, it is particularly regrettable that the British government has adopted such an attitude, and even worse, that this attitude has been widely publicized on the eve of Gromyko and Reading's meeting in London on April 11 to review the situation in Indochina." The newspaper said that Britain's request that the two chairmen limit their discussions to providing full protection for the South Vietnam International Commission "further undermines the purpose of the talks." The report said: "One view in New Delhi is that London has yielded to American pressure and has reluctantly agreed to support the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, with the aim of maintaining the de facto division of South Vietnam along the 17th parallel like Korea."

    印度报纸尖锐抨击英国对越南问题的态度
    据新华社新德里13日电　英国政府就越南问题给苏联的复照在印度引起尖锐的抨击。“印度时报”十二日刊登的消息说，英国对越南选举的态度“使得印度政府感到极大的惊异”。这家报纸说：“从印度的观点看来，尤其遗憾的是，英国政府竟然采取了这种态度，更糟的是，在葛罗米柯和里丁在四月十一日在伦敦举行会议审查印度支那局势的前夕，广泛宣传这种态度。”这家报纸说，英国要求两位主席把他们的讨论限于向南越国际委员会提供充分的保护问题，这“进一步破坏了这次会谈的目的”。消息说：“新德里的一个观点是，伦敦已经向美国压力让步了，它已经勉强地同意支持吴庭艳政权，目的在于使南越沿着十七线像朝鲜那样保持实际上的分治。”
