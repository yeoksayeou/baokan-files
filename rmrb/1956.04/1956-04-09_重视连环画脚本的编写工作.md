    Emphasize the Scriptwriting Work of Comic Strips
    Li Lu
    The quality of a comic strip's script plays a decisive role in the overall quality of the comic strip. The completion of a comic strip relies not only on artistic creation but also on the efforts of writers. Just as film production and theatrical performances must first have a script to serve as a basis, the creation of comic strips often requires writing a script first. Therefore, the primary step in improving the quality of comic strips is to improve the quality of their scripts.
    In recent years, we have published a large number of comic strips, which have been widely welcomed by the masses. Some of the more outstanding works have even been praised by readers. While this is attributable to the artistic creation of the artists, we must not ignore the contributions of the scriptwriters. The relative success of certain comic strips is due, in large part, to the well-written scripts.
    However, at present, the work of comic strip scriptwriters has not received the attention it deserves, and the ideological level and writing skills of many writers lag far behind the needs of the masses. Although we have a number of well-written comic strip scripts, the overall quality of scriptwriting is generally not high. Most scriptwriters can only adapt literary works. Some cannot even study and analyze the original works, but can only swallow them whole without understanding, even dismembering and fragmenting the original, taking excerpts out of context, and losing the spirit of the original. Some adaptations of classical literature, historical stories, and folk tales also lack the ability to choose appropriately. Their handling of certain historical figures is often flawed, even disseminating feudal and idealistic viewpoints. Some writers also have poor writing skills, and there are still major shortcomings in their use of language. Inappropriate wording, overuse of nouns, a mixture of literary and colloquial language, and vague expressions are very common in the text descriptions of comic strips.
    At the same time, some comic strip scriptwriters themselves still have the idea of ​​despising popular reading materials and despising serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. On the one hand, they say, "Writing comic strip scripts is not something a lazy person can do well," while on the other hand, they say, "It is not something a capable person is willing to do." They underestimate the positive role of their work. Some writers have poor artistic literacy and are not active in learning, so they are not easy to improve in their work. Many writers also have varying degrees of serious shortcomings such as detachment from politics and detachment from life. They neglect the study of political theory and do not go deep into the lives of the masses, but simply work behind closed doors, dividing other people's entire literary works into simple descriptive sentences. Even fewer writers have impure motives, treating scriptwriting as a means of making profit. They can write the text descriptions for dozens of comic strips in an hour, but this is not due to their proficient writing skills, but can only be said to be their irresponsibility. The quality of scripts written in this way is of course even more crude.
    With the complete victory of the cooperative movement in the vast countryside, 500 million farmers have put forward new demands for comic strips. First of all, the number of comic strips published and distributed must be greatly increased, which inevitably requires more and higher quality comic strip scripts. Strengthening the writing of comic strip scripts and strengthening the leadership of writing work are extremely urgent.
    First, we require comic strip publishing departments to improve the scriptwriting work of comic strips, formulate specific plans, expand the ranks of writers, help writers improve their political and professional levels, organize them to participate in learning, and regularly go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to experience life and draw on creative subjects. Give appropriate encouragement to outstanding writers and give necessary criticism to writers who are poorly made and have impure motives.
    Secondly, comic strip artists can also write scripts themselves. Comic strip artists should exercise and improve their creative talents, and should not completely rely on ready-made scripts. To complete a comic strip, the author must unify the decision of the subject matter, arrangement of plot, creation of characters, design of picture composition, etc. in the entire creative process, and should not separate the "writing" and "drawing" work completely. Even in comic strips co-authored by writers and artists, the artist cannot simply make some illustrations for the script written by the writer, but requires true cooperation between the two parties.
    At the same time, we also ask writers to pay attention to this work, assist and support it, and hope that writers can participate in this work. The editing work of comic strip publishing departments also needs to be done by editors with a certain literary and artistic literacy to improve and enhance the quality of comic strips.

    重视连环画脚本的编写工作
    黎鲁
    连环画脚本质量的高低，对整本连环画的优劣起着决定性的作用。一本连环画的完成，不仅依靠绘画创作的劳动，而且还须依靠文字工作的努力。正如电影的摄制和戏剧的上演首先要有剧本作依据一样，连环画的创作，往往首先要写出一个脚本。因此，提高连环画质量的首要一环，就是提高连环画脚本的质量。
    几年来，我们出版了大量的连环画，受到了群众的普遍欢迎，其中有些相当优秀的作品，还得到了读者的赞扬。这些作品，除归功于画家的艺术创造而外，我们决不能抹煞脚本编写者的劳绩。某些连环画的所以比较成功，它们的脚本编写得好便是重要原因之一。
    可是目前，连环画脚本编写者的工作，还没有获得应有的重视，许多编写者的思想水平和写作修养远远落在群众需要的后面。虽然我们有不少连环画的脚本编写得较好，但是一般说来，脚本的编写质量还是不高的。脚本编写者绝大部分都只能根据文学作品进行改编，有的还不能研究和分析原著，只能生吞活剥、囫囵吞枣，甚至把原著支解割裂、断章取义，失去了原作的精神。根据古典文学作品和历史故事、民间传说等来进行改编的，也有些缺乏选择的能力，对于某些历史人物的处理，时常有错误，甚至散布封建的唯心的观点。有些编写者的文字修养也较差，在语言的运用上还存在很大的缺点，用语不当、滥用名词、文白混杂、词不达意等现象，在连环画的文字说明中是很普遍的。
    同时，连环画脚本的编写者本身也还有人存在着轻视通俗读物、轻视为工农兵服务的思想，他们一面说：“编连环画脚本是懒人做不好的，”而一面又说：“是能人不愿做的。”他们低估了自己工作的积极作用。一部分编写者文艺修养较差，学习也不积极，在业务上因而不易提高。不少编写者还程度不同地存在着脱离政治、脱离生活的严重缺点，他们忽视政治理论的学习，也不深入群众生活，只是闭门单干，把别人整篇的文学作品，分割成一条一条的简单的说明词而已。更有少数编写者，动机不纯，把编写脚本当作营利的手段，他们可以在一小时里编写几十幅连环画的说明文字，但这并不是由于编写技巧的熟练，而只能说是他们的不负责任，这样编写的脚本，质量当然更加粗劣了。
    随着合作化运动在广大农村的全面胜利，五亿农民对连环画提出了新的要求，首先是连环画出版和发行的数量必须大大增加，这也就必然需要更多的和质量更高的连环画脚本。加强连环画脚本的编写和加强编写工作的领导，是十分迫切了。
    首先，我们要求连环画出版部门，改进连环画脚本的编写工作，订出具体规划，扩大编写者的队伍，帮助编写者提高政治和业务水平，组织他们参加学习，定期地到工农兵群众中去体验生活和汲取创作题材。给优秀的编写者以适当的鼓励，给粗制滥造、动机不纯的编写者以必要的批评。
    其次，连环画家也可以自己动手编写脚本。连环画家应该锻炼和提高自己的创作才能，不要完全依赖现成的脚本。一本连环画作品的完成，作者要把决定题材、安排故事情节、创造人物形象、设计画面构图等等统一在整个创作过程中，而不应把“编”“绘”工作截然分开。即使是编者和绘者合作的连环画，绘者也不能仅仅为编者所写的脚本作些图解便算了事，而需要双方真正的合作。
    同时，我们还要求文学家注意这个工作，加以协助和支持，并希望能有作家参加这个工作。连环画出版部门的编辑工作也需要有一定文学艺术修养的编辑人员来做，以改进和提高连环画的质量。
