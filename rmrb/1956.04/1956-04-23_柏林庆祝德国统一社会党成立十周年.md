    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 22nd: A celebration marking the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was held at the Metropol Theater in Berlin on the evening of April 21st. More than two thousand people attended the meeting. President Pieck's presence was warmly welcomed.
    At the meeting, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ulbricht, and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Grotewohl, spoke successively. Ulbricht said: The unification of the two workers' parties is a decisive turning point in German history. Due to the establishment of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the working class was able to fulfill its historical task of building a new Germany as a leading force.
    Ulbricht then said that the result of the unification of the German Communist Party and the German Social Democratic Party is that the past ten years have become a period of victory for the German workers' movement.
    Ulbricht pointed out that in the past ten years, socialism has developed into a world system. Who can doubt that the lofty ideals of socialism can have an increasing influence among the working class in West Germany?
    Ulbricht expressed the hope that West German Social Democrats would be convinced by these achievements of the power of working-class unity. He called on all German working-class organizations to reach an understanding, so that the unification of the motherland can be realized as soon as possible.
    In his speech, Grotewohl first pointed out the great achievements made by the working class of the German Democratic Republic in the past ten years. He said: "These achievements clearly demonstrate the strength and possibilities of the united working class. Without this unity, these achievements would not have been possible. The lessons of the past ten years make us forever follow this path. On this path, the united working class of Germany can contribute great strength to a happy and peaceful future."

    柏林庆祝德国统一社会党成立十周年
    新华社柏林22日电  德国统一社会党成立十周年庆祝大会四月二十一日晚在柏林大都市剧院举行。参加大会的有两千多人。皮克总统的出席受到热烈的欢迎。
    会上，德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希和中央委员会政治局委员格罗提渥相继讲话。乌布利希说：两个工人政党的统一，是德国历史上有决定意义的转折点。由于德国统一社会党的建立，才使工人阶级能够作为领导力量，完成它的建立一个新德国的历史任务。
    乌布利希接着说，德国共产党和德国社会民主党统一的成果，就是使过去的十年成为德国工人运动取得胜利的时期。
    乌布利希指出，十年来，社会主义已经发展成为世界体系。谁能够怀疑社会主义的崇高理想也能够在西德工人阶级中日益产生更多的影响呢？
    乌布利希表示希望西德社会民主党人能从这些成果中相信工人阶级统一的力量。他号召全德工人阶级组织取得谅解，从而使祖国的统一尽快地实现。
    格罗提渥在讲话中首先指出德意志民主共和国工人阶级在十年内所取得的巨大成就，他说：“这些成就清楚地表明统一起来的工人阶级的力量和可能性。没有这种统一，这些成就的取得是不可能的。过去十年的教训，使我们永远遵循这条道路。在这条道路上，德国统一行动的工人阶级能够为幸福与和平的前途贡献出巨大力量。”
