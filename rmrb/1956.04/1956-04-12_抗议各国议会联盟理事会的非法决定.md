    Protest Against the Illegal Decision of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council

    The Inter-Parliamentary Union Council held its 78th session in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, from April 4th to 8th. Due to the obstruction of the United States' premeditated attempt to create international tension and undermine peaceful cooperation between countries, and disregarding the opinions of many countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, and India, the council refused to implement the decision made by the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union at its Delhi meeting last November regarding the admission of the People's Republic of China delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. It delayed the admission of our country to the Union. This is an illegal measure that violates the purpose and charter of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

    At the Helsinki meeting of the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held last August, the US representative played tricks and intrigues, threatening to stop paying membership fees or even withdraw from the Union to obstruct the participation of the People's Republic of China delegation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington on March 23, US Senator Alben W. Barkley, before flying to Yugoslavia to attend this Council meeting, was prepared to "do his utmost to prevent Communist China from entering the Inter-Parliamentary Union with 46 member countries." The United States' repeated obstruction of the People's Republic of China delegation's participation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union in this way only exposes once again its fear of peace and friendship and its unwillingness to ease international tensions, further bankrupting itself politically and morally.

    Since the Union's charter clearly stipulates that its membership should be universal, and its purpose is to consolidate international peace, to promote cooperation between peoples of all countries, and to ensure the peaceful settlement of international disputes through reconciliation; and the People's Republic of China has consistently strived to enhance international cooperation and has made significant contributions to consolidating universal peace, the decision made by the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union at its Delhi meeting to admit the People's Republic of China delegation to the Union has fully affirmed this point. Now, the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council, under the obstruction of the alliance council members of the United States and other countries, has excluded the participation of the People's Republic of China delegation representing 600 million people. This not only violates the Union's aim of promoting friendly relations and peaceful coexistence between countries through consultation and cooperation between parliamentarians of different systems on major world issues, but also runs counter to the wishes of all peace-loving people in the world.

    The Chinese people believe that the correct decision made by the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union at its Delhi meeting must be respected and implemented. The illegal decision passed by the Dubrovnik Council meeting is illegal and cannot be established. The Inter-Parliamentary Union's illegal rejection of the People's Republic of China delegation's participation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union at the Helsinki meeting in August 1955 was already an intolerable and major mistake. This time, the Union Council not only did not show any sign of correcting this mistake, but instead illegally overturned the correct decision on admitting the People's Republic of China delegation adopted by the Delhi Executive Committee, which is another major mistake in the history of the Union. If it does not firmly correct this mistake and allows the United States' conspiracy to create international tension to continue to succeed, it can only cause the Union to lose its prestige in the face of world public opinion and prevent the Union from playing its positive role in accordance with its purposes and charter.

    At this Council meeting, representatives of parliamentary groups from many countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, and India insisted on the just proposition of admitting the People's Republic of China delegation to the Union. During the vote on April 7th, twenty-three council members voted in favor of this proposition. The Soviet parliamentary group issued a statement after the meeting, stating that it would steadfastly defend the legitimate and inalienable right of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The chairman of the Yugoslav parliamentary delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council meeting, Simic, also issued a statement, pointing out that the decision of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council to postpone the admission of the People's Republic of China was illegal and legally invalid. This just proposition is in line with the wishes of peace-loving people in all countries. History will prove that the just proposition that conforms to the wishes of the people will surely win.

### 抗议各国议会联盟理事会的非法决定

    抗议各国议会联盟理事会的非法决定
    各国议会联盟理事会于四月四日到八日在南斯拉夫的杜布罗夫尼克举行了第七十八次会议，由于美国蓄意制造国际紧张局势、破坏各国和平合作的预谋的阻挠，竟不顾苏联、波兰、南斯拉夫和印度等许多国家的意见，对各国议会联盟执行委员会去年十一月德里会议通过的关于接纳中华人民共和国人民代表团加入各国议会联盟的决定拒不执行，拖延接纳我国参加联盟，这是违反各国议会联盟的宗旨和章程的非法措施。
    在去年八月召开的各国议会联盟执行委员会赫尔辛基会议上，美国代表就曾玩弄阴谋诡计，以停止交会费甚至退出联盟进行要挟，阻挠中华人民共和国人民代表团参加各国议会联盟。据合众社华盛顿三月二十三日消息，美国参议员艾尔本·吴·巴克莱在飞往南斯拉夫参加这次理事会会议之前，即已准备“竭尽全力来设法阻止共产党中国进入有四十六个国家参加的各国议会联盟。”美国这样倒行逆施地一再阻挠中华人民共和国人民代表团参加各国议会联盟，只能又一次暴露了它害怕和平友好，不愿国际紧张局势和缓的面目，使它自己在政治上和道义上进一步破产。
    既然联盟章程中明确规定它的会员应该具有普遍性，它的宗旨在于巩固国际和平，促进各国人民间的合作，保证通过和解的方式来和平解决国际争端；而中华人民共和国一贯地为增进国际合作而努力，对巩固普遍和平作了重大的贡献。各国议会联盟执行委员会德里会议所作的接纳中华人民共和国人民代表团加入联盟的决定已经完全肯定了这一点。而现在各国议会联盟理事会竟在美国等国家的联盟理事的阻挠下，排斥了代表六亿人民的中华人民共和国人民代表团的参加，这不但是违反了联盟所主张的不同制度国家的议员对世界重大问题进行协商和合作来促进各国之间的友好关系和和平共处的宗旨，而且是与世界各国一切爱好和平的人民的愿望背道而驰的。
    中国人民认为：各国议会联盟执行委员会德里会议所做的正确的决定，是必须尊重和贯彻执行的；杜布罗夫尼克理事会会议通过的非法决定，是非法的，不能成立的。1955年8月赫尔辛基会议上，各国议会联盟非法地否决了中华人民共和国人民代表团的参加各国议会联盟，已经是一个不可容忍的重大错误，而这一次联盟理事会不但没有改正这种错误的任何表现，反而变本加厉地非法地将德里执行委员会上通过接纳中华人民共和国人民代表团的正确决定加以推翻，这就是联盟历史上的又一次的重大错误。它如果不坚决纠正这个错误，而听任美国制造国际紧张局势的阴谋继续得逞，只能使联盟在世界公正舆论面前丧失威信，使联盟不能按照它的宗旨和章程发挥它的积极作用。
    在这次理事会会议上，苏联、波兰、南斯拉夫、印度等许多国家议员团代表都坚持接纳中华人民共和国人民代表团加入联盟的正义主张。在四月七日会议上进行表决的时候，有二十三个理事对这种主张投了赞成票。苏联议员团在会议闭幕后发表声明，表示将坚定不移地捍卫中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的合法的、不可剥夺的权利。参加各国议会联盟理事会会议的南斯拉夫议会代表团主席西米奇也发表声明，指出各国议会联盟理事会延期接纳中华人民共和国的决定是不合法的，而且在法律上是无效的。这种正义的主张是符合各国爱好和平人民的愿望的。历史将会证明：符合人民愿望的正义主张一定会获得胜利。
