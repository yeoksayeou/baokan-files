    Preparing Gifts for May Day
    Workers in Beijing Factories and Mines Continuously Set New Records
    Workers in factories and mines in Beijing are actively preparing gifts for the "May 1st" International Labor Day.
    To offer a gift to May Day, the young hot blast stove workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant increased the wind temperature to 995 degrees Celsius on the 17th, setting a new national record. This is the fifteenth new wind temperature record they have continuously set in the past 100 days after learning the advanced experience of rapid furnace firing from Anshan Iron and Steel Company.
    After watching the performances of Soviet workers participating in the National Conference of Advanced Producers in the Machinery Industry on the 15th and 17th, workers at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant launched a surge in learning from advanced Soviet experience. Qiu Zhuheng, a worker in the tool workshop, quickly learned to use the tools made by Soviet workers, skillfully mastered the advanced Soviet operation methods, and reduced the processing time of the "dovetail groove" on the universal milling machine from two hours to two and a half minutes, increasing labor productivity by 47 times.
    Workers at the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory actively learned the experience of tending more spindles and looms, and their technical level rapidly improved. The factory originally planned to switch from two shifts to three shifts in May, basically without increasing the number of tending workers, but this has now been realized ahead of schedule on the 18th. In this way, they can produce 600 more pieces of yarn and more than 10,000 more bolts of cloth for the country before May Day.
    From April 1st to 21st, the quality of cotton yarn produced by the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory all reached the first-class grade, and plain cloth, gabardine, and single-sided khaki also overfulfilled the quality targets. (Xinhua News Agency)

    为五一劳动节准备献礼
    北京各厂矿职工连续创造新纪录
    北京市各厂矿企业职工，正在积极为“五一”国际劳动节准备献礼。
    石景山钢铁厂青年高炉热风炉工人，为了向“五一”节献礼，在十七日把风温提高到摄氏九百九十五度，创造了全国最高纪录。这是他们在最近一百天当中，学习鞍山钢铁公司快速烧炉的先进经验以后连续创造的第十五个风温新纪录。
    北京第一机床厂工人，在十五日和十七日观看了参加全国机械工业先进生产者代表会议的苏联工人表演以后，掀起了学习苏联先进经验的热潮。工具车间工人仇注衡很快就学会运用苏联工人制作的工具，熟练地掌握了苏联的先进操作法，使万能铣床的“燕尾槽”加工时间，由两小时降到两分半钟，劳动生产率提高了四十七倍。
    国营北京第一棉纺织厂工人，积极学习多看纱锭、布机的经验，技术水平迅速提高。工厂原定从五月开始，在基本上不增加挡车工人的条件下，由两班改为三班生产，现在已经提前在十八日实现。这样，他们在“五一”节之前，可以为国家多产六百件纱和一万多匹布。
