Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 12th. The delegation from the China Soil Science Society, which was to attend the Japan Soil and Fertilizer Science Society conference, issued a statement in Hong Kong on April 11th, expressing regret over the Japanese government's refusal to issue entry visas.

The statement said: The China Soil Science Society received a letter from the Japan Soil and Fertilizer Science Society in February, inviting soil and fertilizer scholars to attend the Japan Soil and Fertilizer Science Society conference held in Tokyo starting on April 8th, and to conduct visits afterward to promote academic exchanges between China and Japan and enhance mutual understanding. The China Soil Science Society accepted the invitation and sent a delegation composed of Chen Enfeng, director of the general council and researcher at the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Chen Fangji, director of the general council, and one other person to attend the conference.

The statement said that we arrived in Hong Kong as early as April 4th. However, due to the Japanese government's failure to issue visas and failure to provide a reason, we were obstructed midway and unable to make the trip. During this period, we repeatedly received telegrams from the Japan Soil and Fertilizer Science Society, stating that they had negotiated with the Japanese government several times, but without results.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese government's attitude of obstructing international academic exchanges and restricting the broad contact of scientists is contrary to our common desire for the rapid development of the scientific and cultural life necessary for mankind.

The China Soil Science Society delegation to Japan said in its statement: We express our regret over the Japanese government's refusal to issue entry visas this time.

    就日本政府拒发入境签证一事
    我土壤学会访日代表团发表声明
    新华社香港12日电　中国土壤学会派赴参加日本土壤肥料学会大会代表团四月十一日在香港发表声明，对日本政府拒绝发给入境签证一事表示遗憾。
    声明说：中国土壤学会在二月间接到日本土壤肥料学会来函，邀请派遣土壤肥料学者前往参加四月八日起在东京举行的日本土壤肥料学会大会，并且在会后进行参观访问，以便开展中日两国间的学术交流，增进相互间的了解。中国土壤学会接受了上项邀请，并且推派总会理事、中国科学院林业土壤研究所研究员陈恩凤，总会理事陈方济等三人组成代表团，前往参加会议。
    声明说，我们早在四月四日就到达了香港。但是，由于日本政府不发签证，又不说明理由，以致中途受阻，未能成行。在此期间，我们屡次接到日本土壤肥料学会来电，说明他们曾经数次向日本政府交涉，仍无结果。
    声明指出，日本政府采取阻碍国际学术交流、限制科学家广泛接触的态度，是与我们的共同愿望——迅速发展人类所必需的科学文化生活相违背的。
    中国土壤学会访日代表团在声明中说：我们对日本政府这次拒发入境签证一事表示遗憾。
