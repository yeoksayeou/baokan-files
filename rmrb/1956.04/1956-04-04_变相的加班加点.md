Disguised Overtime

Some pit leaders in the Liaoyuan Coal Mine, in order to promote advanced experience, disregarded the workers' health and made them work continuously for fifteen or sixteen hours. Some workers could only rest for three or four hours after finishing work and returning home. The workers said: "Where is this advanced experience? This is disguised overtime."

These pit leaders thought that they could promote advanced experience by extending the working day. In fact, to promote an advanced experience well, workers need to understand what advanced experience is and how to master it; corresponding improvements in production management and technical work are needed. This is a very meticulous political and organizational work. Extending the working day and increasing labor intensity, making the workers exhausted, will not only fail to achieve the goal of promoting advanced experience, but will also seriously damage the workers' enthusiasm for learning advanced experience.

    变相的加班加点
    辽源煤矿有些坑长为了推广先进经验，不顾工人身体健康，让工人连续工作十五、六小时。有些工人干完活回家只能休息三四小时。工人说：“这那里是先进经验？这是变相的加班加点。”
    这些坑长以为用延长工作日的办法就可以把先进经验推广好了。其实，要把一个先进经验推广好，需要工人懂得什么是先进经验，懂得怎样掌握它；需要相应地改善生产的管理工作和技术工作。这是一个很细致的政治工作和组织工作。延长工作日，增加劳动强度，把工人弄得疲劳不堪，不但不能达到推动先进经验的目的，反而严重地损害工人学习先进经验的积极性。
