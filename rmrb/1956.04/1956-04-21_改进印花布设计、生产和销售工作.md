Local areas should establish pattern selection committees led by industrial departments in a step-by-step manner.

    改进印花布设计、生产和销售工作
    全国印花布设计、生产、销售工作改进会议十九日结束。这次会议集中研究了进一步提高印花布质量的问题。
    会议认为今后各有关方面的领导人员必须加强对印花布生产的各个环节的领导，克服设计中的保守思想和抄袭作风，树立社会主义现实主义的正确设计方向，改进生产技术，大力提高印花布的质量。商业部门必须认真细致地调查研究消费者的需要，克服组织订货工作中的保守思想，实行进货经理负责制，大力推销新型花布。
    会议强调各有关方面必须要加强设计、生产、销售工作的配合协作，建立选样定产和新产品试制试销的协作制度；决定在第二季度由纺织工业部、地方工业部邀请各有关部门成立纺织美术委员会，领导各地的花样评选和花色纺织品的生产工作，并且成立全国性的样品室，定期进行展览观摩和交流经验。各地要有步骤地建立以工业部门为主的花样评选委员会。
