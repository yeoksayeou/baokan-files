Xinhua News Agency: The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province is promoting the "Quick Literacy Method for Korean Script" created by Li Longxue, a Korean youth. Using this quick literacy method, ordinary Korean farmers can read popular newspapers and write practical documents for daily life in just four months.

Inspired by Qi Jianhua's quick literacy method, Li Longxue, while serving as a teacher in a people's school in 1953, took advantage of the simple strokes and phonetic nature of the Korean script. He first spent sixteen hours intensively teaching the twenty-four letters, and then adopted a literacy game method to consolidate the learning achievements of adult students. This method divides the twenty-four letters of the Korean script into consonants and vowels, distributing them on a clock-face-shaped cardboard disc. Three needles of different sizes in the center point to different letters for phonetic spelling. This literacy game can be carried out during rest or entertainment time. Recently, in areas where the autonomous prefecture's education department is promoting Li Longxue's quick literacy method, fifteen illiterate farmers who had undergone one hundred and thirty-one hours of study were tested. The results showed that the language proficiency of nine students had reached the level of upper primary school.

    朝鲜文字速成识字法
    吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州正在推广朝鲜族青年李龙学所创造的“朝鲜文字速成识字法”。运用这种速成识字法，一般朝鲜族农民只要四个月的时间，就能阅读通俗报纸，写日常生活的应用文。
    李龙学在祁建华的速成识字法的启发下，1953年担任民校教师时，就根据朝鲜文字笔划简易、拼音的特点，先用十六个小时突击教完二十四个字母，然后就采用识字游戏办法，巩固成年学员的学习成果。这个办法就是把朝鲜文字的二十四个字母分成子音和母音，分布在一个钟面圆形硬纸盘上，中央用大、中、小三根针，分指不同的字母进行拼音。这种识字游戏可以在休息时间或娱乐时间进行。最近自治州教育部门在推广李龙学速成识字的地区，对十五名经过一百三十一小时学习的文盲农民进行测验，结果有九名学员语文已达到高小水平。
