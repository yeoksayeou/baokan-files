Beijing Holds Exhibition of Traditional Chinese Paintings

The third exhibition of the Beijing Research Society of Chinese Painting opened on the 8th at the Art Exhibition Hall of the Chinese Artists Association. A total of 279 works are on display at the exhibition. The painters used traditional techniques to depict various beautiful flowers, animals, and landscapes, as well as portraits of ancient Chinese writers and scientists, and figures from folk tales. A portion of the works in the exhibition also reflect the current lives of the people. These works are all new creations by the painters from the past year or so, from last year to recently. The exhibition clearly gives the audience the impression that the capital's traditional Chinese painters' hard work over the past year has achieved gratifying results.
