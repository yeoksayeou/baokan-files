Vigorously Conserve Metal and Steel
Using Indigenous Pig Iron and Steel Shavings as Raw Materials

(Xinhua News Agency) Chongqing City's mechanical factories are taking measures from all aspects to save the country's steel raw materials. In the past, Chongqing Universal Machine Factory always used pig iron from Ma'anshan, Anhui Province, to manufacture castings. This year, after improving the batching technology, they used indigenous pig iron from Qu County, Sichuan Province, to manufacture castings, and the quality also meets the standards. After adopting this kind of pig iron, the freight per ton was reduced by more than 60 yuan, and it also opened up sales for the indigenous pig iron produced in Qu County. Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory has strengthened the recovery of steel shavings this year. In the past, this factory used pig iron to manufacture castings, and the cost was 240 yuan per ton. Now, using steel shavings, it only costs 20 yuan per ton, and the processing cost per ton has also been reduced by more than 70%.

Specialized Meeting on Saving Metal
(Xinhua News Agency) The Shanghai First Bureau of Heavy Industry convened a specialized meeting on saving metal on the 23rd.

Last year, thirty factories under the First Bureau of Heavy Industry, which have implemented joint state-private ownership for a long time, carried out comprehensive conservation work in the second half of the year, saving a total amount equivalent to 786 six-foot lathes, about half of which was saved in metal raw materials. Based on the experience of these thirty old joint ventures, the Deputy Director of the First Bureau of Heavy Industry put forward various conservation measures in terms of technology and management at the meeting, and also proposed organizing technical research groups according to industry and strengthening the unified scheduling of raw materials.

Promote the Experience of Saving Steel Bars
(Xinhua News Agency) Construction units in Changchun City are actively promoting advanced experience in saving steel bars. Some construction units have successfully tested cold-drawn steel bars and advanced experiences such as using butt welding and spot welding instead of binding, and have achieved great results. In the projects designed by the Design Office of the Changchun Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau in the first quarter alone, more than 36,000 kilograms of steel bars were saved.

Trial Production of Bamboo-Reinforced Concrete Components
(Report from our correspondent in Harbin) The Northeast Third Engineering Company has recently successfully trial-produced a batch of bamboo-reinforced concrete components, including door and window lintels, small floor slabs, stair railings, and ridge capping boards. These bamboo-reinforced concrete components have been proven to have good performance through testing. This year, the Northeast Third Engineering Company will widely use bamboo-reinforced concrete components to replace steel-reinforced concrete components, which can save the country more than 300 tons of steel.

    大力节约金属和钢材
    用土生铁和钢屑作原料
    重庆市各机械工厂从各方面采取措施为国家节约钢铁原料。过去重庆通用机器厂一向是用安徽省马鞍山的生铁来制造铸件，今年他们在改进了配料技术以后，利用四川省渠县的土生铁来制造铸件，质量同样符合标准。在采用这种生铁以后，每吨运费减少了六十多元，还为渠县出的土生铁打开了销路。重庆柴油机厂今年加强了钢屑的回收工作。过去这个工厂利用生铁制造铸件，成本是每吨二百四十元，现在利用钢屑，每吨只要二十元，每吨的加工费用也降低了70％以上。（据新华社讯）
    节约金属的专业会议
    上海市第一重工业局，在二十三日召开节约金属的专业会议。
    第一重工业局有三十个实行公私合营较久的工厂在去年下半年进行了全面节约工作，共节约了价值相当于786台六呎车床的金额，其中一半左右是节约的金属原料。第一重工业局副局长根据这三十个老合营厂的经验，在会上提出了技术和管理方面的各项节约措施，还提出按行业组织技术研究小组和加强原材料统一调度等办法。

    推行节约钢筋的经验
    长春市各建筑单位积极推行节约钢筋的先进经验。有的建筑单位试行成功了冷拉钢筋，用对焊、点焊法代替绑扎等先进经验，并且取得了很大成效。仅长春市建筑工程局设计室第一季度所设计的工程当中，便节省了钢筋三万六千多公斤。（据新华社讯）
    试制竹筋混凝土构件
    东北第三工程公司最近试制成功了一批竹筋混凝土构件。其中有门窗过梁、小型楼板、楼梯扶手、屋脊压顶板等。这些竹筋混凝土构件经过试验证明效能良好。东北第三工程公司在今年广泛应用竹筋混凝土构件代替钢筋混凝土构件，可以为国家节约三百多吨钢材。
