On the Construction Site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex
By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming

The preparatory work for the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex has begun ahead of schedule.

A few months ago, this area, covering dozens of square miles, was still rice paddies and mountains. Now, a workers' village with thousands of homes has been built, and the foundation work for three processing plants and a thermal power station has been completed.

The high-rise and overpass of the concrete mixing plant stand on the construction site of the subsidiary enterprises. Around it, pipelines are being laid, foundations are being built, and beams and columns are being installed. A tower crane, more than thirty meters high, is hoisting prefabricated steel frames onto the thermal power station's building. The land leveling project in the factory area, which started just over ten days ago, has already flattened a large area of hilly terrain consisting of hills and low fields into a gentle slope. Bulldozers and dump trucks shuttle back and forth on the slope, continuing to shovel earth from the higher areas to the lower areas.

On the construction site, many heavy tasks are done by machinery. Various types of wood, steel frames, and concrete beams and columns are prefabricated in the processing plants and delivered to various locations by hundreds of trucks.

We stood on a high ground, and a comrade from the construction site pointed to a vaguely visible mountain in front and said, "Where we are standing is the rear of the complex, and the front gate is at that mountain. We will level these countless hills, depressions, and ponds into three leveled areas at different elevations." He estimated that the construction of this iron and steel base would require leveling more than 20 million cubic meters of earth and stripping more than 10 million cubic meters of stone in the factory area and iron ore mine alone. If these earth and rocks were laid flat, each one meter high and wide, they would stretch for more than 30,000 kilometers.

After the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex is completed, it will become a supply base for various types of steel needed for shipbuilding, construction, machinery manufacturing, and other industries. Many factories that rely on it for steel or serve it will be built along with it. Building an iron and steel base on flat ground is a first for our country. To select a factory site, we spent a long time searching in an area spanning hundreds of miles. A design team composed of Soviet experts and Chinese engineers observed from the sky in airplanes, observed on-site in cars, and walked the candidate sites, traversing many small roads and fields that had not been noticed in the past, before finally recommending the current site, which has excellent conditions.

The Soviet Union is also designing and supplying the main equipment for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex. This will be a highly automated and mechanized complex. As soon as trains carrying materials arrive at the storage yard, tippler machines will turn the entire car over to pour out the raw materials. When finished products leave the factory, electric cranes will use magnets to lift the products and load them onto trains. On the giant blast furnaces, steam blowing operations and high-pressure furnace tops will be implemented. This will stabilize production inside the furnace, use less coke, and produce more pig iron. Oxygen steelmaking will be used in the open-hearth furnaces, which will allow fewer open-hearth furnaces to achieve the originally planned output. Design engineers have also arranged the flow of raw materials and products according to assembly line operations and rationally arranged the factory area. In terms of labor conditions design, in addition to general labor protection facilities, two special measures have been taken in response to the hot summers in the Yangtze River basin: one is to appropriately space the open-hearth furnaces that emit huge amounts of heat; the other is to implement air showers—using cold groundwater to cool the hot air, and then sending the cold air to high-temperature control stations and workers' rest rooms.

The people building the complex, filled with longing, came here from Taiyuan, Chongqing, Harbin, and other places. Wang Guijun, an excavator operator working in Huangshi City, forgot to collect his wages when he heard at night that he was being transferred to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex construction site, and packed his bags to wait for daybreak to depart. To collect design data, comrades observing meteorology and hydrology have not had a holiday all year round; comrades measuring terrain often leave early and return late. Some comrades even jumped into ponds to measure elevations when the temperature was one degree below zero. In those most tense days, many comrades worked day and night in the suburbs, and delivered blueprints several miles away with lanterns in their hands at two or three o'clock in the morning. They estimated that the mileage they walked to collect data was more than 360,000 kilometers.

In order to overcome the difficulties of lacking experience and technology, most employees received training before the start of construction, and now thousands of people are studying in spare-time schools and professional technical training classes. Some foremen who originally couldn't read drawings can now read drawings and estimate work and materials. Drilling machine captain Ge Xianwen conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts and developed several new operating methods. The drilling machine he led has exceeded the plan for five consecutive months, eliminated mechanical accidents and in-hole accidents, ensured drilling quality, and saved more than 30,000 yuan for the country. Engineer Zong Junzhang diligently studied the preliminary design sent by the Soviet Union, grasped the key points of the project, and timely helped comrades solve problems, enabling the six designs of the auxiliary workshop he was responsible for to be submitted ahead of schedule or on schedule. Wang Guijun, who switched from fitter to excavator driver, although he only studied in the Northeast for three or four months, worked hard and diligently and created advanced excavation experience, increasing work efficiency from the original four buckets in three minutes to five buckets in two minutes; his excavator is also well maintained, with an attendance rate of 97%. Since the start of construction, he has exceeded the plan by more than 30% every month.

In order to complete the construction tasks ahead of schedule, competition conditions of the workers are posted everywhere in various construction companies and on various construction sites, marked in red and green. The excavator team led by Wang Guijun, who won the title of "Youth Assault Team," decided to improve digging teeth, exert the potential of the machine, and ensure the completion of two and a half years' worth of work in one year. Shen Wenlie and Li Quan'en, two scraper teams, jointly decided to implement a method of one tractor pulling two scrapers and increasing the capacity of the scraper, to ensure the completion of two years' worth of tasks in one year. The Zhang Dasheng masonry team had just set out competition conditions to exceed the plan by 25% every month, when they encountered a new project with extremely strict quality requirements, and everyone failed to meet the quota. Later, they adopted the Soviet large shovel bricklaying method, which broke through the quota and the quality fully met the standards. Workers and engineering technicians are full of confidence, so that the country's new iron and steel base can produce iron and steel ahead of schedule!

    在武汉钢铁联合企业的工地上
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    武汉钢铁联合企业的施工准备工作提前展开了。
    几个月前，在这方圆几十里的地区内，还是稻田和山地，现在已经建起了有几千户住宅的工人村，筑好了三座加工厂和热电站的基础工程。
    混凝土搅拌厂的高楼和天桥矗立在附属企业工地上。在它的周围正在铺管道，砌地基，安梁柱。三十多公尺高的塔式吊车正在把预制好的钢骨架往热电站厂房上吊运。开工才十多天的厂区平土工程，已经把一大片由山丘和低田组成的丘陵地带平整成了一个坦坡，铲土机和自卸汽车群穿梭似地往返在坦坡上，继续把高处的土铲运到低处去。
    在工地上，许多笨重活都由机械操作。各种木材、钢筋架和混凝土梁柱，都是加工厂预制好，由几百辆汽车分送各处。
    我们站在一个高地上，工地的同志指着前面一座隐约的山头说：“我们站的地方是联合企业的尾部，前门在那座山头那里。我们要把这数不清的山丘、洼地和水塘平成三个标高的平地。”他估算了一下，建设这个钢铁基地，仅在厂区和铁矿山两个地方，就需要平整两千多万立方公尺土，剥离一千多万立方公尺石头。将这些土石按宽高各一公尺平铺起来，就有三万多公里长。
    武汉钢铁联合企业建成后，将成为造船、建筑、机器制造和其他工业需用的各种钢材的供应基地。许多仰给它供应钢料或为它服务的工厂都将随着建设起来。平地建设一个钢铁基地，这在我国还是第一次。为了选择一个厂址，我们曾经花了很长时间，在纵横数百里内找了许多个地方，由苏联专家和中国工程师组成的设计小组，乘飞机在天空观察，乘汽车到现场观察，并且在候选厂址步行踏勘，走遍了许多过去没有注意到的小路和田间，最后才为我们推荐了现在这个条件优良的厂址。
    苏联还给武汉钢铁联合企业作好设计和供应主要设备。这将是一座高度自动化、机械化的联合企业。运料的火车一到堆栈，便有翻车机把车箱整个翻转，倒出原料。成品出厂，也有电气吊车用磁铁把成品吸起，装上火车。在巨大的高炉上，将实行蒸汽鼓风作业和高压炉顶，这样便可以稳定炉内生产情况，少用焦炭，多出生铁。在平炉上将采用氧气炼钢法，这样便可以较少的平炉达到原订的计划产量。设计工程师们还按照流水作业来安排原料、产品流动过程，合理布置厂区。在劳动条件的设计方面，除了一般的劳动保护设施外，还针对长江流域夏季酷热的特点，采取了两项特别措施：一项是把散发巨大热量的平炉加以适当间隔；一项是实行空气淋浴——用冰凉的地下水把热空气冷却，然后把冷空气通往高温操纵台和工人休息室。
    建设的人们怀着向往的心情，从太原、重庆、哈尔滨等地到这里来。正在黄石市工作的挖土机手王贵君，晚上一听说调到武汉钢铁联合企业工地，连工资也忘了领，就打起背包等待天明出发。为了搜集设计资料，观察气象、水文的同志，常年没有假日；测量地形的同志常常是早出晚归。有的同志还在零下一度的时候跳进水塘去实测标高。在那最紧张的日子里，许多同志都日夜在郊野工作，深夜两三点钟还提着马灯走几里地去送图纸。他们估算了一下，他们为搜集资料所走的里程就有三十六万多公里。
    为了克服缺乏经验、缺乏技术的困难，在开工前，大部分职工都受过一次训练，现在还有几千人在业余学校和专业技术训练班学习。一些原来不会看图的工长，现在都能看图和估工估料。钻机机长葛贤文认真执行苏联专家建议，并且研究出几种新的操作方法，他领导的钻机一连五个月都超额完成计划，消灭了机械事故和孔内事故，保证了钻孔质量，为国家节约了三万多元。工程师宗俊章认真钻研苏联送来初步设计，掌握了工程关键所在，及时帮助同志们解决问题，使他所负责的辅助车间的六项设计都提前或按期交出了图纸。由钳工转学挖土机驾驶的王贵君，虽然只在东北学习了三、四个月，但是他勤学苦练，创造了先进的挖土经验，工效由原来三分钟挖四斗提高到两分钟挖五斗；他的挖土机也保养得好，出勤率达97％。从开工以来，他都是月月超过计划30％以上。
    为了提前完成建设任务，在各工程公司，在各个工地上，到处都张贴着红红绿绿的职工们的竞赛条件。获得“青年突击手”称号的王贵君领导的挖土机小组，决定改进挖齿，发挥机器潜力，保证一年完成两年半的工作量。沈文烈和李全恩两个铲运机小组，联合决定实行一台拖拉机曳引两台铲土机和加大铲土机容量的办法，保证一年完成两年任务。张大生泥工小组刚订出月月超过计划25％的竞赛条件，就遇上质量要求极严的新工程，大家都没有达到定额。后来，他们采用苏联大铲砌墙，便突破了定额，质量也完全合乎标准。职工们和工程技术人员们都充满了信心，让祖国新的钢铁基地提前炼出铁和钢来！（附图片）
