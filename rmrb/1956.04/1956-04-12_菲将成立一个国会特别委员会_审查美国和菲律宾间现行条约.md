Xinhua News Agency, Manila, April 11th: According to a report in the "Manila Chronicle" on April 7th, the Philippine Presidential Palace and congressional leaders decided at a meeting on April 6th to establish a special congressional committee to review existing treaties and agreements between the United States and the Philippines.

This decision is a compromise agreement reached between the Presidential Palace and congressional leaders. Amidst a recent surge of fierce criticism in Philippine public opinion against U.S. policy toward the Philippines, leaders of the House of Representatives had suggested establishing a joint committee of executive and legislative branches to review U.S.-Philippine relations.

House Speaker Jose Laurel Jr. said at the meeting: This committee will enable the Philippine government to determine what formal demands the Philippines should make to the U.S. government. Senator Jose Laurel said that the Philippines should tell the United States that it is determined to defend its rights as a sovereign nation.

    菲将成立一个国会特别委员会
    审查美国和菲律宾间现行条约
    新华社11日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”四月七日报道，菲律宾总统府和国会领袖们在四月六日的会议上决定成立一个国会特别委员会来审查美国和菲律宾之间的现行条约和协定。
    这个决定是总统府和国会领袖之间达成的一项折衷协议。在菲律宾舆论最近猛烈抨击美国对菲政策的浪潮中，众议院领袖们曾建议成立一个由行政机构和立法机构的联合委员会来审查美菲关系问题。
    众议院议长小何塞·劳雷尔在会议上说：这个委员会将使菲律宾政府能够确定菲律宾应当向美国政府提出一些什么正式的要求。参议员何塞·劳雷尔说，菲律宾应当告诉美国，它决心维护自己作为一个主权国家的权利。
