Leadership Must Be More Specific and In-Depth

    In February of this year, when Huilai County, Guangdong Province, launched a pre-planting production competition, the county party committee continuously received reports on the significant achievements of Yuandun Township in pre-planting work. The reports stated that 315 mu of single-season paddy fields had been converted to double-season paddy fields, and 949 mu of soil had been improved. Therefore, the red flag of the competition was awarded to Yuandun Township.

    However, when the county party committee's inspection team arrived in the township, they found that the facts were completely different from what the township had previously reported. It turned out that the township's party branch secretary and the deputy secretary of the district committee stationed in the township were satisfied with the achievements of cooperativization and the production enthusiasm of the masses, and completely abandoned specific leadership over the pre-planting work. As a result, many problems could not be solved, and the morale of the masses was affected. The township head, on the other hand, repeatedly submitted false reports.

    This fact tells us that it is not enough to rely on listening to reports, and it is even more wrong to abandon leadership. The new situation is creating new problems, requiring leadership work to be more specific and in-depth.

    领导要更具体更深入
    今年二月间，广东省惠来县展开备耕生产竞赛的时候，县委连续接到关于圆墩乡备耕工作有显著成绩的报告。说这个乡单造田已经改双造田的有315亩，改良了土壤的有949亩。因此竞赛的红旗就奖励给圆墩乡了。
    可是，当县委的检查组来到这个乡以后，发现事实和这个乡过去报告的情况完全两样。原来这个乡的支部书记和住在这个乡的区委副书记满足于合作化的成绩和群众的生产热情，完全放弃了对备耕工作的具体领导，以致许多问题得不到解决，群众情绪受到了影响。而这个乡的乡长却接二连三地作起假报告来了。
    这件事实告诉我们，光靠听汇报是不行的，放弃领导更是错误的。新的形势正在产生新的问题，要求领导工作作得更具体更深入些。
