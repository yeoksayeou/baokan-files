Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th April: Stockholm dispatch: Chen Shutong, head of the Chinese delegation to the Special Session of the World Peace Council, spoke at the meeting on April 5th.

Chen Shutong said: The World Peace Movement's propositions over the past six years have been correct, because the "Bandung Spirit," which advocates peaceful coexistence and opposes colonialism, and the "Geneva Spirit," which advocates easing international tensions and resolving international disputes through consultation, have gained increasing support among people worldwide. The international situation is developing favorably for peace, and the forces for world peace have grown. The World Peace Movement identified the key to eliminating war from the outset, advocating the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament, which fully meets the demands of people worldwide.

He said: Today, peace-loving people around the world urgently hope to see a clear agreement reached on the issue of disarmament.

Before a comprehensive agreement on disarmament is reached, reaching individual agreements on partial issues is also beneficial to easing the situation and restoring trust between countries. In this regard, he mentioned stopping nuclear weapons testing and reducing military budgets, etc. He said that if all countries, especially major powers, implement these measures, it will help pave the way for resolving other aspects of the disarmament issue.

Chen Shutong focused on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing. He said that the United States' testing of nuclear weapons in the Western Pacific has caused serious damage to the people of that region and Japan. The United States, disregarding the protests of the vast majority of people, insists on continuing to hold tests near the Marshall Islands, which violates the basic principles of international law and the provisions of the United Nations Charter. This is a new provocative act against the people of Asia and will only worsen the international situation.

Chen Shutong said: Discussions on disarmament are currently being held in London. The proposals put forward by the United States, Britain, and France regarding the supervision and inspection of the number of armed forces, the proportion of military budgets, and the stages of prohibiting nuclear weapons are essentially included in the Soviet Union's proposals. We must frankly tell the Disarmament Subcommittee that the establishment of a preliminary disarmament agreement is a test of the major powers' sincerity in disarmament. Whoever refuses to establish a preliminary agreement fundamentally lacks sincerity in disarmament.

Chen Shutong then spoke about the Chinese people's willingness to disarm and their consistent advocacy of peaceful coexistence with neighboring countries and all other countries in the world.

Chen Shutong cited many facts to illustrate this point. He said: In 1955 alone, more than two thousand cultural and artistic guests from more than thirty countries visited China. Chinese cultural and artistic delegations totaling more than 1,700 people visited twenty-nine countries, traveling across the world's continents. While developing trade with the Soviet Union and people's democracies, we are also developing trade with India, Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, Pakistan, and other countries. Recently, we also concluded trade agreements with Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. These facts are sufficient to prove that as long as there is sincerity, peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems is entirely possible and beneficial.

Chen Shutong said: Unfortunately, some people who stubbornly cling to the Cold War policy are still troubling the world. They have established numerous military bases around the world and cobbled together a series of military treaties and aggressive blocs. The American war forces are still doing everything possible to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, and intensify their aggressive activities in China's territory of Taiwan. Their purpose in doing so is to further exploit the people of all countries, especially the people of Asian and African countries; to maintain international tension, facilitate arms expansion and war preparations, and maintain their tottering colonial system. However, the people of Asian and African countries have bravely stood up in the struggle to defend world peace and oppose colonialism. They must resolutely fight for the cause of their homeland's independence, unity, and peace.

Chen Shutong said that the Chinese people have always loved peace. We have always been committed to striving for a solution to the issue of international disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Although we are still subjected to armed aggression and the threat of war today, forcing us to strengthen our national defense capabilities, we have still taken many specific disarmament measures in our own country. From the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to 1955, we have already demobilized a large number of soldiers to participate in peaceful construction. Today, we firmly advocate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea as soon as possible, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, to facilitate the resolution of the international disarmament issue.

Chen Shutong said that because the United States controls the United Nations and uses the Chiang Kai-shek puppet to usurp the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, the People's Republic of China cannot participate in the discussions and work on disarmament in the United Nations, which is a great loss to the cause of world peace. It is unreasonable to ask a country that cannot participate in the meeting to fulfill the obligations of the meeting's decisions. The Chinese people love peace and firmly advocate disarmament, but we cannot and should not bear the obligations for a disarmament plan decided in a meeting in which no Chinese representatives participate. This is a legitimate and reasonable position that an independent and sovereign country should take to safeguard its sovereignty. He then said that the Chinese people have never been willing to stand idly by and remain aloof from promoting the cause of peace for the world's people. The Chinese people are willing and prepared to participate in any international conference on disarmament, and in such a conference, we will fully support any plan related to disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, as long as it is truly conducive to world peace. The Chinese people will certainly take practical actions to fulfill our obligations under the disarmament plan produced through such a legitimate and reasonable procedure.

Chen Shutong finally called on the Special Session of the World Peace Council to mobilize the world's peace forces to supervise the work of the United Nations Disarmament Committee and demanded that the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting in London must reach a preliminary disarmament agreement. Let all countries in the world accept peaceful competition instead of the disastrous arms race. Let all peace-loving countries and peoples of the world jointly contribute to the realization of this lofty goal.

### 陈叔通在世界和平理事会特别会议上发言

    陈叔通在世界和平理事会特别会议上发言
    新华社柏林7日电　斯德哥尔摩消息：出席世界和平理事会特别会议的中国代表团团长陈叔通在四月五日会议上发了言。
    陈叔通说：世界和平运动六年来的主张是正确的，因为主张和平共处、反对殖民主义的“万隆精神”，主张和缓国际紧张局势和用协商方式解决国际争端的“日内瓦精神”，已经在全世界人民当中得到了越来越多的支持。国际局势有利于和平的发展，世界和平的力量增长了。世界和平运动一开始就找着消除战争的关键，倡导禁止原子武器和裁军，这完全符合全世界人民的要求。
    他说：今天全世界爱好和平的人民迫切希望看到裁军问题达成一个明确的协议。
    在裁军问题的全面协议达成以前，就局部问题达成个别协议也是对缓和局势和恢复国与国之间的信任有益处的。在这方面，他提到停止核子武器的试验和缩减军事预算等等。他说，各国，特别是大国，实现了这些措施，就会有助于为解决裁军的其他方面的问题铺平道路。
    陈叔通着重谈到关于停止试验核子武器的问题。他说，美国在西太平洋试验核子武器，已经使那个地区和日本的人民受到了严重的损害。美国无视广大人民的抗议，坚持要继续在马绍尔群岛附近举行试验，这是违反国际法的基本原则和联合国宪章的条款的。这是对亚洲人民的一种新的挑衅行动，只会使国际局势更见恶化。
    陈叔通说：目前正在伦敦举行关于裁军问题的讨论。美国、英国和法国所提出的关于武装部队的数量监督及视察的办法，军事预算的比例，禁止核子武器的阶段等各点，在实质上都已经包括在苏联的建议里去了。我们必须坦率地告诉裁军小组委员会，成立裁军的初步协议是大国裁军诚意的一个考验。谁要拒绝成立初步协议，谁就是对裁军根本缺乏诚意。
    陈叔通接着谈到中国人民愿意裁军，中国人民一贯主张同邻邦和世界其他一切国家和平共处。
    陈叔通举出许多事实来说明这一点。他说：单在1955年内，有三十多个国家的两千多个文化艺术方面的客人曾到中国去参观过。有总数达一千七百余人的中国各种文化艺术代表团访问二十九个国家，走遍了世界的各大洲。在我国同苏联及人民民主国家发展贸易的同时，也在同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰、巴基斯坦及其他国家发展贸易。最近，我们也同埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩缔结了贸易协定。这些事实就足以证明：只要有诚意，不同制度的国家和平共处是完全可能和有益的。
    陈叔通说：不幸，一些硬抱着冷战政策不放的人们，还在困扰世界。他们在世界各地建立了许许多多的军事基地，并且拼凑了一系列的军事条约和侵略集团。美国战争势力还在千方百计地阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，破坏日内瓦协议在越南的实施，并且加紧在我国领土台湾地区的侵略活动。他们这样作的目的是为了进一步压榨各国人民，特别是亚洲、非洲等国人民；是为了保持国际紧张局势，便于扩军备战以维持其摇摇欲坠的殖民制度。但是亚非各国人民已经在保卫世界和平和反对殖民主义的斗争中英勇地站起来了。他们一定要为争取祖国独立、统一、和平的事业而坚决斗争。
    陈叔通说，中国人民是一贯爱好和平的。我们一向致力于争取国际裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器问题的解决。虽然我们今天还受到别人的武装侵略和战争威胁，迫使我们不得不加强我们的国防力量，但是我们仍然进行了本国许多具体裁军的措施。从1949年中华人民共和国成立起到1955年止，我们已经有大量军人复员参加和平建设。今天我们坚决主张尽早从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，以利国际裁军问题的解决。
    陈叔通说，由于美国把持联合国并且利用蒋介石傀儡窃据中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位，致使中华人民共和国不能参加联合国中关于裁军问题的讨论和工作，这是世界和平事业的一个大损失。让一个不能参加会议的国家履行会议决定的义务，这是不合理的。中国人民热爱和平并且坚决主张裁军，但是我们不能够也不应该对没有中国代表参加的会议中所决定的裁军方案担负义务。这是一个独立自主的国家为了维护自己的主权应当采取的正当合理的立场。他接着说，对促进世界人民的和平事业，中国人民从来不肯袖手旁观，置身事外。中国人民愿意，并且准备参加国际上任何有关裁军的会议，在这样的会议中，任何有关裁军和禁止原子武器氢武器的方案，只要真正有利于世界和平，我们一定会全力拥护。经过这样正当合理的程序所产生的裁军方案，中国人民一定以实际行动来执行我们承担的义务。
    陈叔通最后要求世界和平理事会特别会议动员全世界和平力量来监督联合国裁军委员会的工作，要求在伦敦举行会议的裁军小组委员会一定要达成裁军的初步协议。让全世界的国家都接受用和平竞赛代替灾难无穷的军备竞赛。让全世界爱好和平的国家和人民共同为实现这个崇高的目标作出贡献。
