    Old Policies Under a New Sign
    A Critique of American Sophistry on Asian Policy
    Qin Benli
    In the New Situation
    Since the beginning of this year, there have been numerous calls within the United States to revise its Asian policy. The common reason for these demands is that the U.S. policy of "positions of strength" in Asia has met with obvious failure. Even someone like Holbrecht, the Asia General Manager of United Press International who has consistently touted the U.S. aggressive policy in Asia, recently had to admit: "When we observe the entire Asian region today and compare it with ten years ago or even the recent past, it can be seen that the U.S. position in Asia is declining."
    After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, these demands have increased particularly. Now, the American press and political figures cannot deny that the Soviet policy of striving for peace and international cooperation has been welcomed by the people of Asia and the world, while the policies pursued by the United States are unpopular. As Chalmers Roberts wrote in an article published in the "Washington Post" on March 25, a powerful wind exists in Asia and the Middle East (and will certainly expand to Africa), and that is the irresistible and firm demand for national liberation and improved living conditions. Soviet policy is suited to this demand, while "the United States has not adapted its policy to this new wind." In the words of the American press and political figures, the United States must respond to this "challenge" from the Soviet Union.
    In this situation, one would naturally ask: Have U.S. decision-makers correctly assessed the current situation in Asia and drawn the correct conclusions?
    The answer is provided by Theodore H. White in a dispatch from Asia, dated March 20, in the "New York Post" about Dulles's visit to Asia. The dispatch reveals that after Dulles's visit to Asia, he believed that there was no need to modify the U.S. policy toward Asia, and that "all that is needed is a slightly more flexible attitude toward backward countries." As White put it well, this is "let's do the same thing, but do it in a completely different way."
    The current reality is that the United States is still pursuing that bankrupt "positions of strength" policy. However, the implementation of this policy is now being dressed up with some charming disguises.
        Empty Talk and Reality
    Dulles, who not long ago was vigorously promoting the so-called "brinkmanship" policy, is now also indulging in empty talk about peace. During his trip to Asia and in his speeches after returning home, he has tried to create the impression that the U.S. policy in Asia has no other intention than to maintain peace. However, as the Indian "National Herald" editorial on March 23 stated: The United States "only talks about peace while on the other hand doing many things to undermine peace."
    The United States is working hard to strengthen its military measures in Asia, first and foremost by strengthening the military blocs and alliances it has established in Asia. Eisenhower's recent proposal to Congress for the 1957 fiscal year "foreign aid" plan proves this point. The "aid" allocated for military purposes in this plan accounts for 84.7% of the total appropriation. In the 1956 fiscal year, "aid" for military purposes accounted for slightly more than 77% of the total appropriation. According to U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense, McGreer, the "military aid" planned for the Asian region in the new fiscal year will be "substantially increased" compared to the previous year, with nearly three-quarters going to South Korea, the Chiang Kai-shek group on Taiwan, and Japan. The remainder will be given to the Philippines, Thailand, South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
    Who can say that this "foreign aid" plan is for the maintenance of peace in Asia? Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently severely criticized this "aid," saying: "At a time when we in Asia should devote all our capabilities to the task of development, this military aid creates factors of tension and instability." Amidst the rising tide of the Asian people's movement for peace, and in order to paralyze this fighting spirit of the Asian people and to cover up the United States' increasingly strengthened military aggression in Asia, this is Dulles's base purpose in talking about peace.
    Such "Respect" for National Independence
    Striving for and safeguarding national independence is the strong desire of the Asian people. Now, in Asian countries that have been drawn into military blocs by the United States, not only are the people increasingly opposed to joining these military blocs, but important political figures in these countries are also increasingly convinced that participating in such imperialist military blocs will only damage the sovereignty and independence of these countries, and will only put these countries at risk of being dragged into the military adventures of aggressive forces. A centrifugal tendency has recently become increasingly apparent within the military blocs concocted by the United States. In Asian countries that have declared non-participation in military blocs as a principle of their foreign policy, because they have resolutely pursued this policy, safeguarded national independence, strengthened their role in international affairs, and enhanced their prestige, they feel all the more the importance of pursuing an independent and autonomous foreign policy, and are all the more determined to oppose the U.S. policy of piecing together military blocs in Asia. There is no doubt that all these developments are heavy blows to the "positions of strength" policy pursued by the United States in Asia.
    In order to deceive public opinion and conceal its actions that infringe on the sovereignty of others, the U.S. ruling group has recently particularly disseminated the argument that the United States has always sympathized with the demands of Asian countries for independence. Dulles even used this to defend the policy of piecing together military blocs, saying that if Asian countries "establish common security arrangements together with the United States, their independence can be better guaranteed."
    But everyone knows that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization pieced together by the United States in Asia is not only an aggressive military and political bloc, but also a new tool for enslaving others. Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Pakistan People's Islamic League, recently said that after Pakistan joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, "we cannot use the American arms we currently have without the permission of the United States. The government has concluded such an arrangement, which is an insult to the country." Important Pakistani newspapers and political figures are now increasingly frequently raising the question of whether pursuing a neutral policy is wiser than participating in military alliances and Western blocs. This is indeed a question worth considering by all politicians with national ideas in countries that have been dragged into military blocs by the United States.
    Dulles also said that as for those countries that "prefer not to participate in regional security arrangements," "we also respect this choice." However, how does Dulles "respect" the "choice" of these countries? The most prominent example at present is the United States' most blatant and crude interference in the sovereignty of Cambodia. Merely because the government under the leadership of former Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk refused to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and pursued an independent national autonomous foreign policy, offending the United States, the United States instigated border disputes and blockade actions against Cambodia; and used Cambodia's economic difficulties to exert pressure, forcing Sihanouk to resign as Prime Minister. The United States' crude interference aroused strong righteous resistance throughout Cambodia. Therefore, Dulles recently wrote a letter to the Cambodian Foreign Minister, trying his best to cover up this crude action by the United States, and falsely accused the accusations against this crude interference by the United States as so-called instigations from "all sides," obviously trying to slander Sihanouk, who had been forced to resign by the United States. This is how the United States "respects" Cambodia's own choice.
      For Whose Benefit?
    U.S. decision-makers have also recently particularly emphasized strengthening "economic aid" to Asia. Dulles defended this "economic aid" by saying: "They help to maintain and develop the Asian economy," meaning that this "aid" is for the benefit of Asia. Dulles's hypocritical defense cannot stand up to refutation. Less than a year ago, in June 1955, Dulles bluntly stated at a meeting of the House Appropriations Subcommittee: "The motive for U.S. aid to other countries is not primarily for their benefit, but for the benefit of the United States, otherwise, we would not give them any aid." The example of the Philippines is enough to illustrate the selfish nature of U.S. aid. Jose Roy, Chairman of the Philippine Economic Planning Commission and Congressman, recently pointed out that U.S. "economic aid" to the Philippines has not benefited the Philippines. After studying the implementation of the economic agreement signed between the United States and the Philippines in 1950, he said that out of the approximately US$100 million in "aid" up to January 31, 1956, approximately US$85 million had returned to the United States through the purchase of U.S. goods. The cost of supporting U.S. technical assistance personnel ate up US$14 million, or 14.85%, of the total funds. The United States has not fulfilled the obligations stipulated in the agreement in many respects. The agreement stipulates "diversifying the country's economy by encouraging new industries," but only 3% of the total funds were allocated to industry. Manila Mayor Lacson accused the United States of infringing on the Philippines' sovereignty by using so-called "economic aid." He said: The United States "dares to make demands on the ownership, sovereignty, and jurisdiction over a part of the Philippine territory in exchange for this worthless alms." The fact is very clear that U.S. "economic aid" is by no means a charitable undertaking. It is an investment with ulterior motives, in order to guarantee certain U.S. military, political, and economic interests.
      Revealed its True Colors
    Despite the fact that the United States has put on various disguises in implementing old policies, it has still encountered increasing resistance in Asia. To counter this resistance, the United States also has a so-called "psychological impact" method, which is the threat of force. It has recently conducted continuous "atomic war" exercises in the Asian region, and regardless of the strong opposition of the Asian people and the people of the world, it still insists on testing nuclear weapons in the Pacific Trust Territory. Those who plot the "Cold War" think that waving guns and bombs like this will scare the Asian people. However, they forget that the United States' "atomic deterrent" has never frightened, and will never frighten, the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. On the contrary, the United States' actions have revealed its warlike and colonialist true colors, exposing it as a dangerous enemy that endangers peace in Asia and the world.
    The United States is still continuing to pursue a policy hostile to the Asian people. It seems that life has not taught the U.S. decision-makers any lessons. However, now, no matter from which perspective, the history of Asia is not advancing according to the will of U.S. decision-makers, but is developing according to the will of the awakened Asian people. Some American figures plan to continue the outdated "positions of strength" policy, but no matter what changes are made in the methods or what new tricks are played, they will only encounter even greater failures.

    新招牌下的旧政策
    评美国对亚洲政策的诡辩
    钦本立
    在新的形势下
    自今年年初以来，美国国内纷纷要求修改美国对亚洲的政策。提出这种要求的共同理由是：美国在亚洲的“实力地位”政策遭到了明显的失败。像合众社亚洲总分社社长霍布雷奇特这样一个一贯为美国的亚洲侵略政策吹嘘的人，最近也不得不说：“当我们今天观察整个亚洲地区、并且把它同十年以前或最近的过去相比的时候，可以看出美国在亚洲的地位是在走下坡路。”
    在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，这种要求特别增多起来。现在美国报刊和政界人物无法否认，苏联的争取和平和国际合作的政策，受到了亚洲人民和世界人民的欢迎，而美国执行的政策不得人心。“华盛顿邮报”三月二十五日刊载的查默斯·罗伯茨的文章说得好，在亚洲和中东存在着一股强大的风（而且将来一定会扩大到非洲），这就是民族解放和改善生活的不可压制的坚决要求。苏联的政策适合于这种要求，而“美国还没有使自己的政策适应这种新的风。”用美国报刊和政界人物的话来说，美国必须对苏联这一“挑战”作出回答。
    在这种情况下，人们会自然而然地提出：美国的决策人物是否正确地估计了亚洲当前的局势，而作出了正确的结论呢？
    西奥多·卞根在三月二十日“纽约邮报”刊载的关于杜勒斯访问亚洲的电讯提供了答案。电讯透露说，杜勒斯访问亚洲以后认为，美国对亚洲的政策没有修改的必要，现在“所需要的只是对落后国家的态度稍为再灵活一点”。卞根说得好，这就是“让我们做同样的事情，不过做法要完全两样”。
    目前的事实是：美国仍旧在推行那个已经破了产的“实力地位”政策。不过，推行这项政策时现在穿上了一些迷人的伪装。
        空谈和实际
    不久以前还曾大事鼓吹所谓“战争边缘”政策的杜勒斯现在也奢谈起和平来了。他这次在亚洲旅行时以及在回国后所发表的言论中，就尽力设法造成一种印象，好像美国的亚洲政策除了维护和平以外别无其他打算。然而，正如印度“国民先驱报”三月二十三日的社论所说那样：美国“只空谈和平而另一方面又做许多事来破坏和平”。
    美国正在努力加强它在亚洲的军事性措施，首先是加强它在亚洲所建立的军事集团和联盟。艾森豪威尔最近向国会提出的1957财政年度“对外援助”计划证明了这一点。这个计划用于军事目的的“援助”占整个拨款总额的84.7％。而1956财政年度用于军事目的的“援助”占整个拨款总额的77％强。据美国国防部助理部长帮办麦盖尔透露，新财政年度对亚洲地区计划拨出的“军事援助”，比上一年度 “增加得相当多”，其中将近四分之三将给予南朝鲜、台湾蒋介石集团和日本。其余部分给予菲律宾、泰国、南越、柬埔寨和老挝。
    有谁能说这一“对外援助”计划是为了维护亚洲的和平呢？印度总理尼赫鲁最近就严正地指责了这种“援助”，他说：“正当我们在亚洲的人应该把我们的能力全部用来从事开发的任务的时候，这种军备援助造成了制造紧张局势和不安定的因素”。在亚洲人民争取和平运动日益高涨的形势下，为了麻痹亚洲人民这一斗志，并且为了掩护美国在亚洲日益加强的军事侵略活动，这就是杜勒斯谈论和平的卑劣目的。
    如此“尊重”民族独立
    争取和维护民族独立是亚洲人民的强烈愿望。现在，在被美国拉进军事集团的亚洲国家里，不但人民日益反对加入这些军事集团，就是这些国家的重要政界人士也越来越认为，参加这种帝国主义军事集团，只会使这些国家的主权和独立受到损害，只会使这些国家有被卷入侵略势力的军事冒险中去的危险。在美国策划的军事集团内部最近日益表现出离心的倾向。在亚洲那些宣布以不参加军事集团作为外交政策的原则的国家，由于它们坚决地奉行了这种政策，维护了民族独立，增强了它们在国际事务中的作用，并提高了威望，使它们越加感到奉行独立自主的外交政策的重要，越加坚决地反对美国在亚洲拼凑军事集团的政策。没有疑问，所有这些事态的发展，对美国在亚洲推行的“实力地位”政策是沉重的打击。
    为了蒙混舆论，掩饰自己侵犯别人主权的行动，美国统治集团最近特别散布了这样一种论调：美国一向同情亚洲国家争取独立的要求。杜勒斯甚至这样来为拼凑军事集团的政策辩护，他说，亚洲国家如果同美国“一起建立共同安全安排，它们的独立就可以得到较好的保证”。
    但是谁都知道，美国在亚洲拼凑的东南亚条约组织，不仅是侵略性的军事和政治集团，并且也是奴役别人的新工具。巴基斯坦“人民回教联盟”领袖穆吉布尔·雷赫曼最近说，巴基斯坦参加了东南亚条约组织之后，“如果没有得到美国的许可，就不能使用我们目前所获得的美国军火，政府缔结了这样一个安排，就是侮辱了国家”。巴基斯坦重要报刊和政界人物现在越来越频繁地提出这样一个问题，即执行中立政策是否比参加军事联盟和西方国家集团明智。这确是被美国拉进军事集团的国家中一切有民族思想的政治家值得考虑的问题。
    杜勒斯还说，至于那些“宁愿不参加区域性的安全安排”的国家，“我们也尊重这种选择”。然而，杜勒斯怎样来“尊重”这些国家的“选择”呢？目前最突出的一个例子就是美国对柬埔寨的主权的最露骨和粗暴的干涉。仅仅由于柬埔寨王国前首相西哈努克领导下的政府拒绝参加东南亚条约组织，奉行一个独立国家自主的外交政策，触犯了美国，美国就策动了对柬埔寨的边境纠纷和封锁行动；并且利用柬埔寨经济困难施予压力，迫使西哈努克辞去首相的职务。美国的粗暴干涉激起了柬埔寨全国正义的强烈反抗。因此，最近杜勒斯写信给柬埔寨外交大臣竭力掩饰美国的这种粗暴行动，并且把对美国这种粗暴干涉的指责诬赖成是所谓“各个方面”的挑拨，显然是想中伤已经被美国迫使辞职的西哈努克。美国就是这样“尊重”柬埔寨自己的选择的。
      为了谁的利益？
    美国的决策人物最近还特别强调要加强对亚洲的“经济援助”。杜勒斯为这种“经济援助”辩护说：“它们有助于保持和发展亚洲经济”，意思说这种“援助”是为了亚洲的利益。杜勒斯这种虚伪的辩解是经不起驳斥的。还不到一年以前，1955年6月杜勒斯在众议院拨款小组委员会的一次会议上就直言不讳地说过：“美国援助其他国家的动机，主要不是为了它们的利益，而是为了美国的利益，否则，我们是不会给它们任何援助的”。菲律宾的实例足以说明美国援助的利己主义性质。菲律宾经济计划委员会主席、众议员何塞·罗伊最近指出，美国对菲律宾的“经济援助”并没有使菲律宾得到好处。他研究了美国和菲律宾在1950年签订的经济协定执行情况后说，在到1956年1月31日为止的约一亿美元“援助”中，约有八千五百万美元通过购买美国商品而重新回到了美国手中。美国技术援助人员的供养费吃去了全部经费中的一千四百万美元，即14.85％。美国在很多方面都没有履行协定中规定的义务，协定规定“用鼓励新工业的办法来使国家的经济多样化”，但经费总额中只有3％是拨给工业的。马尼拉市长拉克森指责美国利用所谓“经济援助”侵犯菲律宾的主权。他说：美国“竟然敢于提出对菲律宾一部分领土所有权、主权和管辖权的要求作为这种不值钱的布施的交换代价”。事实很清楚，美国的“经济援助”绝不是什么慈善事业，它是一种别有用心的投资，为的是保证美国的某种军事、政治和经济利益。
      暴露了真面目
    尽管美国在执行老一套的政策时穿上了各种伪装，在亚洲还是受到了越来越大的反抗。对这种反抗，美国还有一个所谓“心理影响”的办法，就是武力威胁。它在亚洲地区最近连续进行了“原子战争”的演习，并且不顾亚洲人民和世界人民的强烈反对，仍然坚持要在太平洋托管地区试验核子武器。那些策划“冷战”的人以为，这样舞动枪炮和炸弹会吓住亚洲人民。然而他们忘记，美国的“原子威慑力量”从来没有吓倒过，也永远吓不倒亚洲和世界各国爱好和平的人民。相反，美国这样作就暴露了它的好战和殖民主义的真面目，暴露了它是危害亚洲和世界和平的危险敌人。
    美国仍旧继续推行着敌视亚洲人民的政策。看来，生活并没有使美国的决策人物得到什么教训。然而，现在不论从哪方面看，亚洲的历史不是按照美国决策人的意志前进的，而是按照觉醒了的亚洲人民的意志向前发展的。某些美国人士打算继续过时的“实力地位”政策，但不论方法上作什么改变，耍出什么新的花样，只会遭到更大的失败。
