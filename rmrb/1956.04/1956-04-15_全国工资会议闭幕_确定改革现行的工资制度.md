Xinhua News Agency, April 14th:

    The National Wage Conference, lasting for more than a month, concluded on April 7th. The conference discussed some major policy issues related to the wage system, and initially drafted new wage plans for national state-owned industrial, basic construction, transportation, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, state-owned commercial, supply and marketing cooperative systems, and cultural, educational, scientific, health, and state organs. According to these plans, the wage levels of workers, technicians, and staff in state-owned enterprises, educational, scientific, health, and cultural workers, and state organ cadres who rely on wage income as their primary source of livelihood will be raised to varying degrees this year. Furthermore, on the basis of increasing wages, the egalitarianism, lack of uniformity, and other unreasonable phenomena in the past wage system will be gradually overcome.
    The conference, based on the policy clearly put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, determined to reform the current wage system in accordance with the principles of "gradually improving the lives of workers on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity" and "to each according to his work." The conference believes that with the development of production and the increase of labor productivity in recent years, the lives of workers have been improved to varying degrees. The average monetary wage of workers in national industrial enterprises in 1952 increased by 57.7% compared to 1950, and increased by 13.7% in 1955 compared to 1952. However, since the country entered planned construction, wage work has lagged behind the development of production, and the principle of gradually improving the lives of workers on the basis of developing production has not been earnestly implemented. Therefore, the conference believes that these old wage systems must be reformed.
    Under the direct guidance of the State Council, the conference conducted detailed research on several policy issues in the socialist wage system and reached a consensus.
    1. Regarding the relationship between wages and production. The representatives unanimously agreed that wages must gradually increase with the development of production and the increase of labor productivity, but the increase in wages must be lower than the increase in labor productivity. At the same time, when increasing wages, consideration must be given to the reduction of enterprise costs, the state's financial strength, the supply of market commodities, and so on.
    2. Regarding the level of wages. The conference believes that this requires not only looking at the growth of nominal wages (i.e., monetary wages), but also requires a practical investigation and research on the actual wage situation. Therefore, in addition to correctly implementing the wage policy, it is also necessary to gradually solve the problem of the necessary living supplies for all laborers. In production, efforts should also be made to reduce work stoppages and idle work to ensure the income of workers.
    3. Regarding the principles and steps for reforming the wage system and how to unify the wage system. The conference criticized the idea of ​​seeking uniformity in wage standards regardless of the actual conditions of various regions and the different conditions of various industries, and believed that the unification of the wage system should be the unification of wage policy ideas, wage management, and certain important systems, rather than implementing the same wage standards across the country regardless of the circumstances. Unreasonable phenomena in the past wage system must also be gradually reformed to achieve rationality, rather than subjectively demanding complete rationality at once.
    Now these policy principles have been embodied in the new wage plans of various departments. The new wage plan abolishes the outdated wage point system, and directly implements the monetary wage system according to the needs of various industries for developing production, regional prices and living standards, and the current wage situation. This makes it easy for the masses to calculate, and is also conducive to enterprise planning management and economic accounting. The new wage plan also unifies the wage standards and wage grade coefficients according to the industry, and changes the phenomenon of different pay for the same work in wages to some extent. In order to further implement the principle of distribution according to work and encourage workers to work hard to improve their skills, wage differences are clearly stipulated between heavy and simple labor, underground and above-ground, and high-temperature and normal-temperature workers. Higher wage standards are also stipulated for workers doing piecework to encourage workers to be willing to implement piecework wages. Reasonable provisions have also been made for promotion issues to encourage workers to improve their technical level. The wage plan also stipulates the implementation of a job wage system for technicians and staff, which is to determine wages based on the positions they hold, and the wage standards for personnel with heavy responsibilities are stipulated to be higher. A higher wage technical allowance system is also stipulated for engineering and technical personnel to encourage them to give full play to their technical talents and better serve socialist construction. In order to promote the economic development of important departments and important regions, higher wage standards have also been stipulated for these departments and regions in order to encourage workers to be willing to work in these regions and departments. Regarding the phenomenon of higher wage levels in coastal cities, the conference believes that this is formed due to various historical reasons and the specific conditions of these regions. These cities undertake the important task of supporting national construction with manpower and material resources. Therefore, the wage levels of workers in these cities should not only not be reduced, but should also be appropriately increased under possible conditions. At the same time, unreasonable wage systems should be appropriately reformed; those with particularly high original wages will not be reduced in this reform, and those whose original wages are lower than the wage standards stipulated in the new wage plan should be appropriately increased.
    During the conference, Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Lai Ruoyu all gave important instructions to the conference on several important policy issues.

### 全国工资会议闭幕  确定改革现行的工资制度

    全国工资会议闭幕
    确定改革现行的工资制度
    据新华社14日讯　历时一个多月的全国工资会议已经在四月七日结束。会议讨论了有关工资制度中的一些重大政策问题；初步拟订了全国国营工业、基本建设、交通运输、农业、林业、水利、国营商业、供销合作系统和文化教育、科学、卫生、国家机关等部门新的工资方案。根据这些方案，今年我国依靠工资收入为主要生活来源的国营企业的工人、技术人员、职员，教育、科学、卫生、文化工作者和国家机关干部的工资水平都将得到不同程度的提高，并且在提高工资的基础上，逐步克服过去工资制度中的平均主义、不统一和其他不合理的现象。
    会议根据中共中央早就明确提出的方针，确定按照“在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步改善职工生活”和“按劳付酬”的原则，来改革现行的工资制度。会议认为几年来随着生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高，职工的生活已经得到不同程度的改善。1952年全国工业企业职工的平均货币工资比1950年增长了57.7％，1955年又比1952年增加13.7％。但是从国家进入有计划建设以来，工资工作却落后于生产的发展，没有认真贯彻在发展生产的基础上逐步改善职工生活的原则。因此会议认为必须将这些旧的工资制度加以改革。
    会议在国务院直接指导下，对社会主义工资制度中的若干政策问题作了详细的研究，并取得了一致的认识。
    一、关于工资和生产的关系问题。代表们一致认为工资必须随着生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高而逐步提高，但工资的增长又必须低于劳动生产率的增长。同时在增加工资时必须考虑到企业成本的降低，国家财政力量、市场商品的供应情况等等。
    二、关于工资水平的高低问题。会议认为这不仅要看名义工资（即货币工资）的增长情况，而且需要对实际工资情况作切实的调查研究。因此，除了正确执行工资政策外，还必须逐步解决一切劳动者的必需的生活供应问题。在生产上也要力求减少停工、窝工现象，以保证工人的收入。
    三、关于改革工资制度的方针、步骤问题和工资制度如何统一问题。会议批判了那种不顾各地区的实际情况，不顾各产业的不同条件，强求工资标准划一的思想，认为工资制度的统一应该是在工资的政策思想、工资管理和某些重要制度上的统一，而不是不分别情况在全国实行同一的工资标准。对过去工资制度中的不合理现象，也必须逐步改革，求得合理，而不应主观地要求一次作到完全合理。
    现在这些政策原则已经体现在各部门新的工资方案中了。新的工资方案废除了过时的工资分制度，按各产业发展生产的需要、地区物价和生活水平、现在的工资情况，直接实行货币工资制，这样使群众容易计算，也有利于企业的计划管理和经济核算。新的工资方案还按产业统一规定了工资标准和工资等级系数，对工资中同工不同酬的现象有所改变。为了进一步贯彻按劳付酬的原则鼓励工人努力提高技术，对于繁重劳动和简易劳动、井下和井上、高温和常温工人之间都较明显地规定出工资差别。对做计件工作的工人也规定了较高的工资标准，以鼓励工人愿意实行计件工资。对升级问题也作了合理的规定，以鼓励工人提高技术水平。工资方案中还规定对技术人员和职员实行职务工资制，就是根据他们所担负的职务来规定工资，职责繁重的人员的工资标准就规定得高一些。对工程技术人员还规定了较高的工资技术津贴的制度，以鼓励他们充分发挥自己的技术才能，更好地为社会主义建设服务。为促进当前重要部门，重要地区经济建设的发展，对这些部门和地区也规定了较高的工资标准，以便鼓励职工乐意到这些地区和部门去工作。对沿海城市工资水平较高的现象，会议认为这是由于种种历史原因和这些地区的具体情况形成的，这些城市担负着以人力、物力支援国家建设的重大任务，因此这些城市的职工工资水平不但不应降低，而且应在可能条件下适当的有所增加，同时对不合理的工资制度应该进行适当的改革；原来工资特别高的，在这次改革中不予降低，原来工资低于新工资方案所规定的工资标准的，应该适当提高。
    会议期间，国务院总理周恩来、副总理李富春，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚都在若干重要政策问题上向大会作了重要指示。
