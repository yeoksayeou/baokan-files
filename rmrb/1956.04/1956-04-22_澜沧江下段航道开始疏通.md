    Lower Lancang River Channel Dredging Begins
    The Lancang River Navigation Station has transferred thirty-four experienced channel blasting experts to be responsible for clearing the Lancang River channel from Jinghong to Ganlanba in the lower reaches. The channel dredging project will be completed within the next two months.
    The section of the Lancang River from Jinghong to Ganlanba has rapid currents and many hidden reefs, making navigation very inconvenient. After the channel dredging project is completed, the Lancang River Navigation Station will send a navigation team to the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture to operate transportation services on the Jinghong to Ganlanba section of the route.

    澜沧江下段航道开始疏通
    澜沧江航运站已抽调三十四个有经验的航道爆破手，负责清理澜沧江下段由允景洪到橄榄坝的航道。疏通航道的工程将在最近两个月内完成。
    澜沧江允景洪到橄榄坝段，水流急湍，暗礁很多，航运非常不便。疏通航道的工程完成以后，澜沧江航运站将派一个航运队到西双版纳傣族自治州，经营允景洪到橄榄坝段航线的运输业务。（云南日报编辑部）
