Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Another newly installed power generation unit officially began generating electricity on April 16th at Baotou, the iron and steel base currently under construction. This is the sixteenth power generation project above quota that has been put into production by China's electric power industry this year. The commissioning of these sixteen power generation projects has increased the generating capacity of state-owned power plants and centrally managed joint state-private power plants across the country by 8% compared to the beginning of this year. Among these sixteen projects, more than half of the equipment capacity is equipped with automated devices, which can improve the safety of power generation, reduce workers' labor, and save fuel coal.

    一项发电工程投入生产
    正在建设中的钢铁基地——包头，又有一套新安装的发电设备在四月十六日正式发电。这是中国电力工业在今年新投入生产的第十六项限额以上的发电工程。这十六项发电工程的投入生产，使全国国营电厂和中央管理的公私合营电厂的发电能力，又比今年年初增加了8％。这十六项工程中，占全部设备容量一半以上的发电设备，有自动化装置，能提高发电的安全性和减轻工人的劳动，并且还能节省燃煤。（据新华社讯）
