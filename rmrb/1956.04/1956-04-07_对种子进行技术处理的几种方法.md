    Several Technical Methods for Treating Seeds
    Chen Hongyou
    Applying some technical treatments to improved seeds before sowing can not only promote seed germination and make seedlings grow strong, but also prevent the occurrence of certain diseases and insect pests. In this way, the yield-increasing potential of improved seeds can be better realized.

    Since liberation, some seed treatment techniques have been promoted in some areas and are very popular among the masses. In recent years, many places have found some new methods in summarizing the experience of the masses and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Various treatment methods have good effects on ensuring and improving yields.

    Some seed treatment techniques can promote seed germination. The most common aspect of this is soaking and sprouting rice seeds. This method is not only conducive to sowing, but also makes the growth and development of seedlings uniform and complete, which is convenient for doing a good job in seedling field management and cultivating strong seedlings. Soaking cotton seeds in warm water (a ratio of three parts boiling water to one part cold water) and soaking corn seeds can promote earlier emergence after sowing. The method used by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is: adding water to the cotton seeds in two installments, half the weight of the seeds, mixing and piling them up, and covering them with cloth or sacks to suffocate the seeds. The first time, add 20% of the seed weight in water, mix and suffocate for three to four hours, and the second time, add 30% of the water and suffocate for twenty to twenty-four hours. In places where early sowing is practiced, this method is more suitable than soaking in warm water. Pre-sowing sunning of cotton seeds, corn, and peanut seeds can also result in earlier emergence. After soaking or suffocating cotton seeds, mixing and rubbing them with grass ash or sand can prevent the short lint on the cotton seeds from entangling with each other, making sowing easier.

    Some seed treatment techniques can advance the time of emergence, flowering, and fruiting, avoiding unfavorable natural conditions for crop growth in the later stages, thereby increasing crop yield and quality. In this regard, the most significant effect is vernalization treatment. In 1953, general spring wheat in Longrui Village, Jilin City, had no harvest due to severe stem rust disease in the later stage, while spring wheat that had undergone vernalization treatment still yielded 5,885 jin per hectare because it flowered and fruited ten days earlier. In the Zhangjiakou area, the sowing of vernalized spring wheat also avoided the sharp drop in temperature in August and resulted in increased production. Joint experiments in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi over the past two years have confirmed that cotton seeds after vernalization treatment increased pre-frost flowers and total cotton yield by 3% to 15%. Vernalization treatment of potato seeds in Yanbei Prefecture, Shanxi, has also resulted in increased production. In recent years, many places have learned from the Soviet Union and Bulgaria the technology of soaking seeds in medicinal solutions and have also achieved good results. In Jiyang County, Shandong Province, and other places, wheat seeds were soaked in baking soda solution, which increased wheat production by more than 10%. Soaking rice seeds in baking soda solution or soaking rice and cotton seeds in potassium bromide solution can also increase production.

    Some seed treatment techniques allow germinating seeds and seedlings to absorb sufficient nutrients nearby, resulting in good growth and development. For example, some farmers mix blood meal and chicken manure with seeds before sowing. In recent years, farmers in Shandong and Hebei have mixed ammonium sulfate with wheat seeds and broadcast them, which can increase wheat production. This method can be used in areas with poor soil quality, late sowing, and poor fertilization effects in the spring due to dry soil. Similar in nature to the above seed mixing methods is the method of mixing seeds with rhizobia. Soybeans mixed with rhizobia generally increase production by 5% to 10%, and peanuts increase by 10% to 20%, while the cost per mu is only three to five cents. Therefore, this method is very popular among the masses. In the Northeast, the use of rhizobia to mix seeds has accounted for half of the total soybean cultivation area.

    Many crop diseases and insect pests are transmitted by seeds. Killing germs and pests that adhere to and lurk on or inside seeds by appropriate methods is the most convenient and effective method to prevent and control diseases and insect pests. For example, after Gansu basically popularized the technology of mixing wheat seeds with TMTD, wheat suffering from stinking smut has been reduced from 10% to slightly more than 1%. In the Northeast, constant-temperature soaking is used, and in Zhejiang, cold soaking and sun-drying methods are used to prevent wheat loose smut, which are very effective. Cotton anthracnose, angular leaf spot, wilt, and jute anthracnose can also be prevented and controlled by mixing seeds with TMTD. After sowing seeds treated with chemicals, it can also prevent soil-borne pathogens from invading and causing damage. Furthermore, short-term boiling water soaking can kill broad bean weevils and pea weevils. Seed treatment is also an effective method to prevent certain underground pests. In the past, farmers in Shandong often used arsenic to mix seeds to prevent mole crickets. According to recent experience, mixing seeds with 666 poison grain and broadcasting them can prevent three types of underground pests, including mole crickets, cutworms, and wireworms, which is better than using arsenic to mix seeds.

    The above seed treatment methods are generally simple and easy to implement, but attention should be paid to following the correct operating methods in order to achieve good results. Therefore, before adopting these methods, agricultural experiment stations and technology extension stations should first conduct experimental research, state-owned farms should conduct pilot tests, accumulate experience and master technology, and then gradually promote them through demonstrations. Some farmers are accustomed to mixing seeds with oil. This method lacks scientific basis and they should be advised not to do so in order to reduce waste.

    对种子进行技术处理的几种方法
    陈鸿佑
    在播种前对于良种进行一些技术处理，不但可以促进种子的发芽，幼苗生长壮健，还能防止某些病虫害的发生。这样，就更能发挥良种的增产潜力。
    解放以来有些地方推广了一些种子处理技术，很受群众欢迎；近年好多地方在总结群众经验和学习苏联先进经验中又找到一些新的方法。各种处理方法在保证和提高产量上有良好的效果。
    有些种子处理技术可以促进种子的发芽。在这方面最通行的是稻种的浸种催芽，这个办法既利于播种，也可使幼苗的生长发育匀整齐全，便于做好秧田管理和培育壮秧。棉籽温汤（开水和凉水的比例是三比一）浸种和玉米浸种，可以促使它们播后提早出苗。新疆生产部队的做法是：在棉籽中分两次加入等于种子一半重量的水拌匀堆起用布或麻袋盖闷种，第一次加种子重量的20％的水，拌匀闷三、四小时，第二次再加30％的水闷二十到二十四小时。在提早播种的地方，用这一方法比用温汤浸种更合适。棉籽、玉米和花生种的播前晒种，也可以提早出苗。在棉籽浸种或闷种后用草木灰或砂拌种搓揉，可以避免棉籽上的短绒毛互相纠结而便于播种。
    有些种子处理技术可以提早出苗、开花和结实的时间，避免作物后期生长的不良的自然条件，因而提高作物的产量和品质。在这方面，效果最显著的是春化处理。1953年吉林市龙瑞村一般春小麦因后期发生严重的秆锈病没有收成，而经过春化处理的小麦因为提早开花结实十几天，每公顷仍收到5，885斤。张家口地区播种经过春化的春小麦也因提前成熟避免了八月的温度骤降而得到了增产。两年来河北、山东、山西的联合试验，证实棉籽经过春化处理以后，霜前花和棉花总产量都提高了3％至15％。山西雁北专区马铃薯种春化处理后也收到增产成果。近年好多地方学习苏联和保加利亚的用药液浸种的技术，也得到很好的结果。山东济阳县等地用小苏打药液浸麦种后，使小麦增产了一成多，用小苏打药液浸稻种或用溴化钾药液浸稻种和棉种，也能增产。
    有些种子处理技术可使发芽的种子和幼苗就近吸取到充足的营养料，而得到良好的生长发育。如有些农民用血粉和鸡粪等拌种后播种。近年山东、河北农民用硫酸铵干拌麦种后混播，可使小麦增产。在土质贫瘠、播种期晚以及春季土壤干旱用追肥成效不好的地方，可采用这种方法。和上面拌种方法性质相近的还有用根瘤菌拌种的方法。用根瘤菌拌种的大豆一般增产5％至10％，花生增产一、二成，而每亩成本只用三、五分钱。因此，这个办法很受群众欢迎。在东北，用根瘤菌拌种的已经占到大豆总栽培面积的一半。
    不少作物的病虫害是由种子传染的，用适当方法杀死粘附和潜伏在种子上或种子内部的病菌和害虫，是防治病虫害最便利而有效的方法。如甘肃基本上普及用西力生拌麦种的技术后，患腥黑穗病的小麦已经由10％降低到1％多一点。东北用恒温浸种，浙江用冷浸日晒的方法防治小麦散黑穗病，都很有效。棉花的炭疽病、角斑病、枯萎病和黄麻的炭疽病，也都可用西力生拌种来防治。用药剂拌过的种子播种后，还可防止土壤中的病菌侵入为害。再如短时间的沸水烫种可以杀死蚕豆象、豌豆象。种子处理也是防治某些地下害虫为害的有效办法。山东农民以往多用信石拌种防治蝼蛄。据近年来的经验，用六六六毒谷拌种混播，可以防治蝼蛄、地老虎和金针虫等三种地下害虫，比用信石拌种的方法更好。
    上面这些种子处理的方法，一般地说，都是比较简而易行的，但是要注意按照正确的操作方法去做，才能收到好效果。因此，在采用这些办法前，要由农业试验场和技术推广站先进行试验研究，国营农场试做，积累经验掌握技术后通过示范，逐步推广。有些农民习惯用油拌种，这种方法缺少科学根据，要劝他们不要这样做，以便减少浪费。
