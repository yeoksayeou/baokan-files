Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th (TASS): “Labor News” published a commentary on the international workers' movement written by Monin. The author pointed out the general upsurge of the strike movement in capitalist countries since the beginning of this year.

Monin wrote: In the United States, strikes are happening one after another. From January to March, postal and telecommunications workers in six southwestern states, bus drivers in Baltimore, truck drivers in New York, and workers and staff of "Western Airlines" in twelve western states all went on strike. The 55,000 electrical workers in forty factories of the "Westinghouse Electric Company" went on strike for one hundred and fifty-six days, which ended on March 25th. This was a large-scale strike in the history of the US strike movement in the past twenty-five years, and the striking workers won a victory, with all the dismissed workers being reinstated.

In Italy, the wave of strike movements is even higher. In the first quarter, more than one million workers participated in the struggle. Under the pressure of the strikers, the business owners were forced to agree to increase the wages of 800,000 metalworkers by 4%.

The French working class also demonstrated militant enthusiasm. As a result of the strike struggle, wages have been somewhat increased. In mid-March, a decree was announced to reduce regional wage differences, thereby increasing the wages of certain categories of workers.

In the Federal Republic of Germany, in January and February alone, workers in two hundred and twenty-three different enterprises went on strike, with more than 250,000 workers participating.

Since February this year, 4 million Japanese working people have been waging a struggle to ensure wages that maintain a minimum standard of living and reduce taxes. In Finland, more than 500,000 metalworkers, construction workers, sailors, and other workers participated in a general strike that began on March 1st and lasted for three weeks, resulting in increased wages. The strike of 75,000 metalworkers, transport workers, and other workers in Denmark has lasted for a month. Recently, large-scale strikes have also occurred in many provinces of Spain.

There is hardly a capitalist country where strike movements have not broken out. In Brazil, Chile, Iran, Israel, Malaya, the Philippines, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, foreign enterprises have become the site of serious class struggles this year.

The upsurge of the strike movement reflects the continuous deterioration of the working people's conditions. Throughout the postwar period, monopoly capital has launched attacks on workers' real wages. In the past five years, the real wages of workers in the US railroad transport, automobile manufacturing, and textile industries, as well as coal miners, have decreased by 15%.

The taxes, which increase year by year due to the expansion of armaments, devour a large part of workers' wages. At present, taxation in the United States deprives workers and employees' families of one-third of their income. Income tax on wages in the Federal Republic of Germany has increased by 120% in the past five years.

In all capitalist countries, the continuous rise in the prices of necessities makes the living conditions of the working people even more difficult. In the past eight years, retail prices of goods in the United Kingdom have risen by 54%. In the first few months of this year, the prices of food and industrial products in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the Federal Republic of Germany have risen again.

Monin finally wrote: Poverty and exploitation, mass unemployment, and lack of confidence in the future are making the flames of class struggle, especially the strike movement, burn more and more fiercely in capitalist countries.

    资本主义国家罢工运动普遍高涨
    苏联“劳动报”的述评
    新华社22日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“劳动报”刊登了一篇由莫宁写的国际工人运动述评。作者指出了今年以来资本主义国家罢工运动的普遍高涨。
    莫宁写道：在美国，罢工接二连三地发生。从一月到三月这段时期，西南六个州的邮电工人、巴尔的摩的公共汽车司机、纽约的载重汽车司机和西部十二个州里的“西部航空公司”的工人和职员都举行了罢工。“威斯汀豪斯电气公司”的四十个工厂的五万五千名电气工人罢工了一百五十六天，到三月二十五日才结束。这是美国最近二十五年来罢工运动史上的规模很大的一次罢工，罢工工人获得了胜利，所有被解雇的工人都恢复了工作。
    在意大利，罢工运动的浪潮更是高涨。在第一季度，有一百多万工人参加了斗争。在罢工者的压力之下，企业主被迫同意把八十万五金工人的工资提高4％。
    法国工人阶级也表现了战斗的积极性。进行罢工斗争的结果，使工资有了某些提高。三月中旬公布了关于缩小地区性质的工资差别的法令，从而提高了某些类别的工人的工资。
    在德意志联邦共和国，仅仅在一、二月间，就有二百二十三个不同企业的工人举行了罢工，参加罢工的工人有二十五万人以上。
    今年二月以来，有四百万日本劳动人民进行着争取保证维持最低限度生活的工资和减少捐税的斗争。在芬兰，今年有五十多万五金工人、建筑工人、海员和其他工人参加了从三月一日开始并且延续了三周的总罢工，结果使工资得到提高。丹麦七万五千五金工人、运输工人和其他行业工人的罢工已经延续了一个月。最近在西班牙的许多省也都发生了大罢工。
    几乎没有一个资本主义国家没有爆发罢工运动。在巴西、智利、伊朗、以色列、马来亚、菲律宾、叙利亚以及沙特阿拉伯的外国企业今年成了严重的阶级斗争的场所。
    罢工运动的高涨，反映了劳动人民的境况的不断恶化。在整个战后时期，垄断资本向工人的实际工资发动了进攻。在最近五年内，美国铁路运输、汽车制造和纺织各工业部门的工人以及煤矿工人的实际工资减少了15％。
    由于扩充军备而年年增加的捐税，吞噬了工人工资的大部分。现在，美国的税收剥夺了工人和职员家庭收入的三分之一。德意志联邦共和国的工资所得税在过去的五年内增加了120％。
    在所有资本主义国家中，生活必需品价格的不断上涨使劳动人民境况更加困苦。在最近八年内，英国的商品零售价格上涨了54％。在今年的前几个月内阿根廷、巴西、智利和德意志联邦共和国的食品和工业品的价格又有上升。
    莫宁最后写道：贫穷和剥削、大量失业和对前途缺乏信心，使阶级斗争，特别是罢工运动的火焰在资本主义国家里越来越厉害地燃烧起来。
