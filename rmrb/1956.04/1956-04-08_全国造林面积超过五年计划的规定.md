The afforestation task stipulated in my country's first Five-Year Plan has been overfulfilled. The state originally planned to afforest more than 6,011,000 hectares in five years. According to preliminary statistics as of April 1, incomplete statistics from fifteen provinces including Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan, Anhui, Shandong, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Henan, and Hebei show that 2.18 million hectares have been afforested this spring. Together with the afforestation area completed nationwide from 1953 to 1955, the total is 6.16 million hectares, exceeding the afforestation area stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan by more than 2%. At present, south of the Yangtze River Basin, except for some areas still planting fir and directly sowing oil tea and tung oil trees, most areas are beginning to summarize their spring afforestation experience and arrange future greening preparations. The afforestation campaign in the Yellow River Basin has also been fully launched. The spring afforestation campaign in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces in the Northeast has also begun.
    The quality of afforestation has not been high in past years, failing to meet standards. In order to ensure quality and quantity, inspection teams have been generally established in various places during afforestation, conducting inspections while planting. Non-compliant plants are immediately replanted or re-afforested, striving to plant one tree and ensure that it lives.

    全国造林面积超过五年计划的规定
    我国第一个五年计划期间所规定的造林任务已经超额完成。国家原计划在五年内造林6，011，000多公顷，截至四月一日止的初步统计，据湖南、湖北、广西、浙江、江西、贵州、广东、福建、四川、安徽、山东、陕西、江苏、河南、河北等十五省的不完全统计，今年春季已造林218万公顷，连同全国从1953年到1955年所完成的造林面积，共为616万公顷，已超额完成第一个五年计划所规定的造林面积2％以上。目前，长江流域以南，除部分地区仍在插杉、直播油茶、油桐外，大部分地区开始在总结春季造林经验，并布置今后的绿化准备工作。黄河流域造林运动现在也已经全面展开。东北的吉林、黑龙江等省的春季造林运动也已经开始。
    历年来造林质量不高，没达到标准。为了保质、保量，各地在造林中都普遍建立了检查组，边造林，边检查，不合规格的立即进行补植或重造，争取栽一棵，活一棵。
