Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 25th. Colonel Kochubai, Acting Commander of the Soviet Forces in Berlin, held a press conference in Berlin on the evening of April 23rd, issuing a statement to German and foreign journalists saying that Soviet troops stationed in Germany discovered on April 22nd an underground tunnel dug by American agencies within the territory of the German Democratic Republic, which contained a telephone eavesdropping station. Several electric wires were laid along the underground tunnel from the American-occupied zone of Berlin, and they were connected to the telephone lines used by the Soviet military.

Major General Chalenko, Acting Chief of Staff of the Soviet Forces in Germany, had already written a letter on the same day to Major General Ankers, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Forces in Europe, protesting against the illegal actions of the American military authorities in West Germany with their sinister espionage purposes, and firmly demanded that the criminals be brought to justice and that similar incidents be guaranteed not to occur in the future. The General Staff of the Soviet Forces in Germany suggested that a joint Soviet-American commission be established by the two commands in Berlin to investigate in detail all the facts related to this incident.

Reporters visited the underground tunnel and its equipment on the morning of the 23rd. The underground tunnel is about five meters from the ground, 1.9 meters high, and has electric lighting for easy passage. The tunnel is approximately 460 meters long, extending from the American-occupied zone of Berlin to the underground telephone lines next to the road in the Democratic sector. American intelligence agencies laid several electric wires along the tunnel, connecting the underground eavesdropping station to the radar station in the American-occupied zone. These wires were connected to three trunk lines of the German Democratic Republic telephone bureau and the Soviet military's dedicated telephones. The vault of the underground tunnel is protected by thick sheet iron, and the sides of the tunnel are piled with sandbags, on which tin foil-wrapped pipes are erected.

The telephone eavesdropping station is located in a studio in the tunnel equipped with a switchboard. The studio is two meters high and wide, and about five meters long. The surrounding walls are covered with soundproof and moisture-proof sheet iron and painted snow white. The eavesdropping switchboard is like a fully equipped modern telephone switchboard, with more than 300 connection jacks. The room also has air conditioners, fire extinguishers, direct-line telephones and tape recorders, as well as fluorescent lighting. All the machines are made in the United States or Britain. According to Soviet military officers, when they entered the studio, they found that the Americans had retreated in a hurry. The machines were still running, the lights were not turned off, and the vacuum cleaner used for cleaning was also left there. (Attached picture)

    美国机关在民主德国地下挖掘坑道搞间谍活动
    苏联驻德部队向美军参谋部提出抗议
    新华社柏林25日电  苏军驻柏林部队代理司令科楚巴上校四月二十三日晚在柏林举行记者招待会，向德国和外国记者发表声明说，苏联驻德国部队在四月二十二日发现了美国机关在德意志民主共和国境内开凿的一条地下坑道，这条坑道里设有电话偷听站。从柏林美占区内沿着地下坑道架设了几条电线，并且把它们连接在苏军使用的电话线上。
    苏联驻德国部队代理参谋长查连科少将已经在同日写信给美国驻欧洲部队参谋长安克尔斯少将，抗议西德的美国军事当局这种具有罪恶的间谍目的的非法行为，并且坚决要求把罪犯提交法庭审判，保证今后不再发生类似事件。苏联驻德国部队参谋部建议由美、苏两国驻柏林司令部双方成立一个苏美混合委员会，以详细调查同这个事件有关的各项事实。
    记者在二十三日上午参观了这个地下坑道和坑道里的设备。这个地下坑道距地面约有五公尺，高一点九公尺，有电灯照明便于通行。坑道全长约四百六十公尺，从柏林美占区一直通到民主区马路旁边地下的电话管线。美国特务机关把几条连结着地下偷听站和美占区雷达站的电线沿着坑道架设起来，接在德意志民主共和国电话局和苏军专用电话的三条干线上。地下坑道的穹顶护有厚铁皮，坑道的两旁堆着沙袋，沙袋上架设着裹着锡纸的管线。
    电话偷听站设在坑道里一个装有总机的工作室中。这个工作室高和宽各两公尺，长约五公尺。四周墙壁用隔音和防潮的铁皮复盖，粉刷成雪白色。偷听总机就像一个设备齐全的现代化电话总机一样，它共有三百多个接线插头。室内还有空气调节器，灭火器、直线电话和录音机等设备，并有日光灯照明。所有的机器都是美国或英国制造的。据苏军军官说，当他们进入这间工作室时，发现美国人撤退得很狼狈，机器仍在开动，电灯也没有关熄，打扫用的吸尘器也丢在那里。（附图片）
