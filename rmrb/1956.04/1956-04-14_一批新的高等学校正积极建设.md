Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: A number of new universities and colleges are under active construction and will begin classes after the summer vacation this year. In addition to the newly built teaching building and laboratory, the Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping will also complete a weather-protected training field and an astronomical laboratory equipped with a movable roof before the start of school. The Shanghai Shipbuilding College will utilize the old site of Jiaotong University after its relocation. In addition, two special laboratories, a ship model basin and a lofting room, are under design. The first phase of construction of a newly built comprehensive university—Zhengzhou University—is scheduled to be completed before July.

This year, the newly built higher industrial schools include Chongqing Institute of Geology, Xi'an Institute of Architecture and Engineering, Xi'an Institute of Power Engineering, Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering, Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping, Shanghai Shipbuilding College, and Suzhou Aeronautical Technical School, a total of seven schools. Among them, shipbuilding, radio engineering, power engineering, surveying and mapping schools are the first specialized colleges established in our country. Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering will train professional engineers in the fields of electrical vacuum technology, radio engineering, radio parts and insulation material manufacturing, and wired communication equipment manufacturing. Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping is specifically for training professional talents in astronomical geodetic surveying, aerial photogrammetry, engineering surveying, and cartography.

Among the newly built universities and colleges, there are also comprehensive universities, medical colleges, and higher normal schools.
