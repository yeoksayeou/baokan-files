Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 26th: The inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region continued today.

Zhang Guohua, Second Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, delivered a report at the meeting.

Following this, Ape A-wang Jinmei, a member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, provided an explanation at the meeting regarding the organizational rules of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region. These organizational rules will be discussed at the meeting.

Fan Ming, representative of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Lieutenant General Tan Guansan, representative of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting. Tan Guansan said: When the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region is established, we must not forget the existence of imperialism and a few hidden counter-revolutionary elements, who will inevitably try every means to provoke disunity among our ethnic groups and undermine the achievements of our progressive cause. This is something we must be vigilant about at all times. If imperialism and hidden counter-revolutionary elements dare to carry out any activities to undermine the construction cause of the Tibetan people, we will definitely join the Tibetan people in giving them a thorough blow.

At today's meeting, representatives of the Tibet local government, Suokang Wangqing Geler, representatives of the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, Zhandong Jijinmei, and representatives of the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee, Bangda Duoji, all spoke. They unanimously supported the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and expressed their willingness to continue strengthening the unity between all ethnic groups and within the Tibetan ethnic group. Sakya A-wang Tuqin Banba, representative of the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, Chupu Garmapa Beiri Dorje, representative of the Karma Kagyu sect, and Molin A-wang Queza, representative of the Minzhulin sect, all expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the Chinese Communist Party's policy of protecting freedom of religious belief in their congratulatory speeches.
