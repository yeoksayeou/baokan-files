    The Train Races Across the Fields
    Lin Danqiu
    One
    The train races across the fields in March, rumble, rumble, rumble.
    Outside the window, the dazzling green of the wheat seedlings, interspersed here and there with the yellow flowers of rapeseed. They are so full of life and vitality, you can almost see them growing vigorously every second, and you can almost smell their moist fragrance through the glass window. Many crisscrossing ancient field ridges have disappeared, and the boundless fields, radiating the light of spring, are like a green ocean under the morning sun, making the surviving ancient tombs covered with weeds appear particularly desolate and bleak. In the rivers and ditches near the railway line, a collective labor frenzy is boiling: groups of people roll up their trouser legs and skillfully wield shovels, shoveling out black, oily river mud and ditch mud, and piles of such fertilizer are piled up along the roadsides and fields. The weather is warm, the work is intense, and they wipe the sweat from their foreheads with their sleeves. Not far from where they are working, newly knitted woolen sweaters that they have taken off are scattered haphazardly on the edge of the field.
    Inside the carriage, many faces are pressed against the window glass, watching the brocade-like earth, watching the battle-like labor, watching the quiet villages, near and far. Many talkboxes have been opened. Some report the news of the start of mechanized farming this year, describing the enthusiastic scene of thousands of people leveling ditches and tilling the land; some discuss the shortage of "three shirts" (woolen sweaters, undershirts, and cotton undershirts) in the interior last autumn, predicting that more "three shirts" and galoshes, thermos bottles, and printed cloth will be needed this autumn. Some tell of the grand occasion of welcoming demobilized soldiers back to their hometowns to produce, some boast of the achievements of eliminating illiteracy in their villages and towns, and some report the scene of large numbers of urban middle school girls going to the countryside to practice in the fields. A group of girls wearing grey cloth uniforms take turns loudly imitating a speech by a person in charge of an agricultural cooperative at a cadre meeting: "Production must be fierce, like Zhang Fei; education work must be meticulous, like Zhuge Liang..."; an old woman in her fifties introduces the training situation of the county's midwife training class, and promotes the benefits of new methods of midwifery; a middle-aged farmer praises the exemplary role of a youth team in a cotton-growing agricultural cooperative in breaking production conventions: "Other production teams replant at most five inches deep, but they replant more than a foot deep...". From these noisy conversations, you can hear the sound of the train of rural life moving forward: rumble, rumble, rumble.
    Two
    "You're right, the countryside is simply galloping..."
    The person speaking to me was my neighbor, a farmer not yet forty years old. A cotton coat with a black velvet collar was draped over his shoulders, a black coarse woolen hat was propped on the back of his head, and several prominent wrinkles ran across his forehead. The most striking feature of his face was a pair of simple and expressive eyes, as if he were thinking about something all the time. He had only known me for a few hours, but he was already talking like an old friend.
    "...We all seem to be living two lifetimes."
    How could it not be? Take himself, for example, before liberation he was a hired hand, now he is the director of an advanced cooperative with more than a thousand households; before liberation he was illiterate, now he can read newspapers and take notes; before liberation he would respond when someone called him, and answer when someone asked him a question, now he can make long reports and summaries at the cooperative's cadre meetings.
    "Are there any ideological problems among the cadres?"
    "Yes. We have to work on their thinking all the time," he replied. "After the bumper harvest last year, there was a general sense of complacency, as if everything was settled and there was no need to use our brains anymore. But this year we put forward new output targets, and technical operating procedures, and asked everyone to discuss them. Guess what they did? Sigh, some kept silent, and some simply complained about the difficulties. We held meetings, large and small, for several days and nights, and finally got their thinking straightened out."
    "It's not easy to lead such a large cooperative."
    "We rely on strong core members!" he said decisively. "We've been running the cooperative for four or five years, and we've trained a group of core members."
    From his conversation, I learned that this large cooperative was formed by merging more than ten cooperatives last autumn, and he was the leader of the oldest core cooperative.
    "Did you encounter many difficulties when you first started the cooperative?"
    He shrugged his shoulders, and the cotton coat with the black velvet collar slipped off his back.
    "There are difficulties every year," he said. "The most difficult was probably in 1953..."
    That was the second year of running the cooperative. Although production increased in the first year, and the income of cooperative members generally increased, the foundation was too weak, and the spring famine in 1953 was still serious. Although there was government relief, many of the more than fifty cooperative member households were still frequently short of food. Landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, satirizing and attacking: saying things like "People fall into agricultural collectives, like cows fall into grinding mills," or "Women have been liberated into rotten fields..." Some rich peasants deliberately held bowls full of glutinous rice and said to cooperative members who were out of food: "You are already living a socialist life, there is nothing we can do, we can only eat some glutinous rice." This caused many cooperative members to lose confidence in running the cooperative, and they became discouraged.
    "The Party branch led us to fight against landlords and rich peasants, vigorously publicized the significance of increased production in the first year of running the cooperative, and publicized the superiority of cooperatives, while at the same time helping each other and providing mutual relief, cutting firewood, catching fish, and engaging in production for self-help. Every day we stood on the bridge and watched the chimneys of households in difficulty. When we saw that the chimney of any household was not smoking all day, we ran to that household to see, and when we saw that men, women, old and young were all lying on the bed with empty stomachs, we immediately divided out a liter and a half of grain to them. One Party member gave all of his family's liter of grain to others, and his own family went hungry, deliberately burning a pot of water to make his own chimney smoke. Later, other families learned about this situation and were all moved to tears. We got through the spring famine this way, and no one withdrew from the cooperative. On the contrary, many households asked to join the cooperative. But the difficulties at that time were so terrible that my heart still trembles when I think back on them now."
    His voice also seemed to tremble a little.
      "To tell you the truth," he continued, "at that time, we who came from hired labor backgrounds only knew that we could not survive if we did not persist in running the cooperative, and only believed that the ideas that the Party gave us would never be wrong, but our understanding of the cooperative was still vague, and our reliance on others was very serious. We hoped that the government would solve all our difficulties for us, and we never thought that the collective strength would be so great, and we never thought that we would have the days we have today!..."
    Three
    The train races across the fields, rumble, rumble, rumble.
    Not far away, a village filled with cooking smoke appears. A large area of dense orchards is clearly visible, and the flowers on the scattered branches can be vaguely distinguished, but it is not easy to tell what kind of fruit trees they are.
    "Probably peach trees," my neighbor's face left the window glass. "Peaches are like cotton, they are just afraid of insects!"
    His expressive eyes seemed more active, and an almost imperceptible smile appeared on his face. He obviously remembered something interesting. He did tell me about it. There was a middle-peasant household in his village with about a hundred peach trees, and every year the peaches were eaten by insects, and they could not sell them for a hundred yuan. The cooperative wanted him to spray with DDT, but he didn't believe it, and he was reluctant to spend the money. After the cooperative had a bumper harvest the year before last, the middle-peasant household also joined the cooperative, bringing about a hundred peach trees with him. The cooperative sprayed with DDT, and last year the peaches grew plump and shiny, without a single insect hole, and they sold them for more than five hundred yuan.
    "Don't they regret joining the cooperative?"
    "How could they not regret it?" His expressive eyes narrowed with laughter. "Especially the women, they have a heavy heart. I heard they even cried. But we cured their heart disease with an abacus, helping her calculate the family's income in detail: cotton, indica rice, orchards..."
    His conversation was interrupted by a burst of laughter behind us. We hadn't been paying attention to other people's conversations, and we didn't know what they were laughing at. The story that caused the laughter was obviously over, but their conversation continued.
    "There are such 'old hands' everywhere," a young man who laughed until tears came out of his eyes wiped his eyes with his sleeve. "There is a production team leader in our cooperative who is also a famous 'old hand', and he is a perfect match for that old uncle you mentioned. In July of '54, the cotton-growing areas suffered serious insect damage. Other production teams used pesticides to kill the insects, but he didn't, saying it was a waste. He had his old experience: Moldy weather and rain are better than urine irrigation, the sun in dog days is like burning fire. He believed that the moldy rain would wash the cotton insects to the ground, and then the sun in dog days would kill the insects. That year, the moldy rain did fall continuously, but there was very little sun in dog days. The cotton insects were 'irrigated' to the ground by the rain, but they didn't die, and they crawled back onto the cotton. As a result, all the other production teams increased production, but only his team decreased production. At the evaluation meeting, his face turned white, his eyes were full of tears, and he couldn't say a word."
    The audience laughed again. We two also laughed.
    "But to be fair," his expressive eyes became serious. "'Old hands' are still 'old hands', they have a wealth of production experience. As long as they accept advanced technology, they are better than several young men!"
    Our conversation naturally turned to advanced technology. He said that people living in the world cannot live without clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Cotton growing on the ground also requires various conditions: first, ventilation; second, light transmission, row planting is for ventilation and light transmission; third, a certain temperature; fourth, a certain amount of moisture; and fifth, sufficient fertilizer. He said that as long as you understand these principles, you will understand the importance of advanced science and technology. I couldn't say a word, just stared with my eyes wide open.
    "We often say that the yield of the field is bottomless," he continued, "What does this sentence mean? The yield of our ancestors was fixed, every mu of land yielded so many jin of seed cotton and so many jin of rice every year. Only by learning scientific knowledge and improving operating techniques every year, can the yield be truly bottomless. If we don't do this and cling to the old experience, even if we establish a cooperative, the yield is still fixed."
    Four
    The train races across the fields, and our conversation turns to leadership work. I asked him what his experience was, and he thought about it.
    "Based on our experience," he said, "the leadership must focus on three tasks: first, summarizing experience; second, improving the system; and third, straightening out thinking."
    According to him, the current outstanding problem is the quality of work. Everyone is desperately earning work points, but if the system is not sound and the ideological work is not meticulous, some cooperative members will cut corners.
    "We summarize experience every year, and we find loopholes in the system every year. This year we are implementing decentralized management, establishing a responsibility system layer by layer from the cooperative to the brigade to the squadron to the team to the individual, being responsible for the cooperative's production plan, and at the same time we must do a good job in setting labor quotas. This will not only ensure the quality of work, but also fully mobilize the enthusiasm of cooperative members."
    He especially emphasized the importance of ideological education. He said that education work must be meticulous and cannot be simplified at all, and we must value the experience of the masses themselves, and educate the masses with facts, not just talk empty words. He has the deepest understanding of this. He gave several examples.
    For example, some middle peasants were afraid that others would not work as well as they did after joining the cooperative, and they were afraid that they would suffer losses, so they were not very enthusiastic about labor, and it was useless to say anything to them. Later, the management committee organized them to inspect the work done by others, and they demanded that those they thought were unqualified be redone. When they inspected, they were shocked to find that it was precisely the work they had done that should be redone. They not only felt relieved, but also gave all their money to the cooperative as production investment.
      "As long as the education work is done well, there are no truly backward cooperative members!" he said. "Leaders must use several things at all times: a pair of eyes, two ears, a brain, and an abacus. Use your eyes and ears to understand the ideological situation of cadres and cooperative members, use your brain to analyze the situation, and then use the abacus to break their ideological concerns. If you do this, you will be foolproof!"
    He stopped talking, narrowed his eyes, and was obviously still thinking about something.
    "There is another point that is very important," he continued. "Team leaders must take the lead in production, and they cannot sit with their legs crossed and command others, telling this person to work hard and that person to run hard. If they do this, the cooperative members will say that you are a big boss or a small boss, and they won't buy your account. No matter how beautiful the words are, they are useless. Some production teams in our cooperative have had this happen. Can you say that the cooperative members are wrong? If they do this, what else are team leaders besides big bosses and small bosses!"
    From his profound and vivid words, I absorbed so much experience and wisdom! If I hadn't come into contact with him personally, I wouldn't have known how far the excellent peasant cadres under the leadership of the Party have "galloped."
    In the rumbling sound of the train moving forward, our conversation continued. When talking about the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, his expressive eyes seemed particularly active again.
    "I often think," he said, "as long as every cadre and every cooperative member truly regards the cooperative as a large family, and treats the affairs of the cooperative as they treat their own housework, being diligent and thrifty, then that would be great. But we can't do it right now, this is a big problem. When cooperative members see that production increases every year, and personal income increases every year, they say that it doesn't matter to eat and drink a little. How can it 'not matter'? If individuals spend money recklessly and don't value production investment, it will affect the development of the cooperative and affect the personal income for the coming year. As for the cooperative's leading cadres, they must keep a close eye on expenses. When the cooperative is large, if you loosen your hand, several thousand yuan will fly away!..."
    The train suddenly whistled a few times, then vibrated a few times, and stopped at a station. My neighbor had to stop talking. He stood up, shook my hand tightly, and left. I watched his slender figure sandwiched in the crowd through the glass window, and his decisive voice seemed to be still ringing in my ears: "As long as the education work is done well, there are no truly backward cooperative members!"
    The train continued to move forward: rumble, rumble, rumble.

    列车在田野上奔驰
    林淡秋
    一
    列车在三月的田野上奔驰，轰隆隆，轰隆隆。
    车窗外，是耀眼的麦苗的嫩绿，这里那里夹杂着油菜的黄花。它们是那样富有生机和活力，仿佛看得出它们每秒钟都在蓬勃地成长，仿佛隔着玻璃窗也闻得到它们的湿润的清香。许多纵横交错的古老的田塍都已消失了，焕发着春光的无边无际的田野，有如朝阳照耀下的绿油油的海洋，长满荒草的残存的古墓，显得分外冷落和凄凉。在靠近铁路线的河里沟里，沸腾着集体劳动的热潮：成群结队的人们卷起了裤腿，熟练地挥动着铁铲，铲出黑油似的河泥、沟泥，路旁地边堆满了这样的肥料。天气暖和，劳动紧张，他们用衣袖抹着额上的汗。在离他们不远的地头，杂乱地放着从他们身上脱下来的崭新的毛线衫。
    车厢里，许多张脸紧贴着窗玻璃，望着锦绣似的大地，望着战斗似的劳动，望着或远或近的静静的村庄。许多话匣子都打开了。有的报道今年开始机耕的消息，描述几千人平沟整地的热烈场景；有的谈论去年秋后内地“三衫”（毛线衫、卫生衫和棉毛衫）脱销的情况，预料今年秋后需要更多的“三衫”和套鞋、热水瓶、花布等。有的说述敲锣打鼓欢迎转业军人回乡生产的盛况，有的夸耀本村本乡扫除文盲的成绩，有的报告大批城市女中学生下乡下地实习的情景。一群穿灰布制服的姑娘轮流地大声摹仿一个农业社负责人在干部大会上的演说：“生产要猛呀，要像三张飞；教育工作要细呀，要像诸葛亮……”；一个五十多岁的老婆婆介绍县里接生员训练班的训练情况，宣传新法接生的好处；一个中年农民赞叹棉区一个农业社的青年队打破生产常规的示范作用：“别的生产队复地至多复到五寸深，他们呢，复到一尺多深……”。从这些嘈杂的谈话中，你可以听到农村生活列车前进的声音：轰隆隆，轰隆隆。
    二
    “你说得对，农村简直在跑马……”
    对我说话的人是我的邻座，一个不到四十岁的农民。一件衬着黑绒领子的棉大衣披在身上，黑粗呢制帽托在后脑袋上，额上横着几条显著的皱纹。脸上的最大特征是一双淳朴而富有表情的眼睛，好像时时刻刻都在思索着什么似的。他跟我认识不过几个钟头，但已经像老朋友似的谈话了。
    “……我们个个人都好像活了两辈子。”
    怎么不是呢？就拿他自己来说吧，解放以前是雇工，现在是一个一千多户的高级社的社长；解放以前一字不识，现在能够看报、记笔记了；解放以前别人喊一声，他应一声，问一句，答一句，现在能在全社干部大会上做长报告、做总结了。
    “干部当中有什么思想问题吗？”
    “有。经常要打通思想，”他回答。“去年丰收后，普遍有自满情绪，好像什么都笃定了，用不着再动脑筋了。可是今年我们提出新的产量指标，提出技术操作规程，要大家讨论，你猜他们怎么样？吓，有的闷声不响，有的索性叫起困难来了。大会小会开了几天几晚，总算把他们的思想打通了。”
    “这样大社不容易领导呀。”
    “靠骨干强！”他斩钉截铁地说。“办社办了四、五年了，锻炼出了一批骨干。”
    从他的谈话中，我知道这个大社是去年秋后由十多个社合并成的，而他就是其中历史最久的核心社的领导人。
    “你们最初办社碰到不少困难吧？”
    他耸耸肩膀，衬着黑绒领子的棉大衣从背后滑下去了。
    “困难年年有”，他说。“顶难过的要算五三年。……”
    那是办社的第二年。虽然第一年就增产，社员收入普遍增加，但是底子太薄，1953年春荒仍然严重。虽有政府救济，五十多户社员中仍有好些户时常缺粮。地主富农趁机造谣破坏，讽刺打击：说什么“人落农庄，好比牛落磨房”呀，什么“妇女翻身翻到烂田里去了”呀……。有的富农故意捧着满碗糯米饭对断炊的社员说：“你们已经过社会主义生活了，我们没有法子，只好吃点糯米饭算了。”弄得好些社员失掉办社信心，灰溜溜的了。
    “党支部领导我们同地主富农斗争，大力宣传办社第一年增产意义，宣传合作社优越性，同时互助互济，砍柴捕鱼，生产自救。我们每天站在桥上看困难户的烟囱，看见哪一户烟囱整天不冒烟，就跑到哪一户去看，看见男女老小都空着肚子躺在床上，大家马上匀出一升半升粮食给他们。一个党员把自家一升粮食全部给了别人，自己一家饿肚子，故意烧着一锅水，让自家烟囱冒烟。后来别家知道了这种情况，都感动得哭了。我们便这样度过了春荒，没有一户退社，反而有许多户要求入社。但当时的困难是多么可怕呀，现在回想起来，心还发抖哩。”
    他的声音也仿佛有些发抖了。
      “说老实话，”他接着说，“当时我们这些雇工出身的人只知道不坚持办社就活不下去，只相信党给我们出的主意决不会错，但对合作社的认识还是模糊的，依赖思想非常严重，什么困难都希望政府替我们解决，还想不到集体力量那么大，想不到有今天的日子！……”
    三
    列车在田野上奔驰，轰隆隆，轰隆隆。
    不远处，出现了一个弥漫着炊烟的村庄。一大片茂密的果树林了然在望，错落的枝条上的繁花隐约可辨，但不容易看出到底是什么果树。
    “大概是桃树，”我的邻座的脸离开了窗玻璃。“桃子像棉花一样，就怕虫！”
    富有表情的眼睛显得更活跃了，几乎看不出来的微笑出现在他的脸上。他显然想起了什么有趣的事情。他果然告诉我这件事情。他的庄子里有一户中农有百来株桃树，年年桃子都给虫咬得精打光，卖不到一百元。合作社要他用滴滴涕打，他不相信，也舍不得花钱。前年合作社丰收后，那户中农也入社了，带着百来株桃树。合作社用滴滴涕一打，去年桃子个个长得油光水滑，没有一个虫孔，卖了五百多元。
    “他们不后悔入社吗？”
    “怎不后悔呢？”富有表情的眼睛笑得眯拢来了。“特别是女的，心病重哪，听说还哭过。可是我们用算盘治好了她的心病，帮她算清一家收入的细账：棉花、籼稻、果园……”
    他的谈话被我们后边的一阵閧笑打断了。我们刚才没有注意听别人的谈话，不知道他们笑什么。那个引起閧笑的故事显然是结束了，但他们的谈话仍然继续着。
    “这样的‘老把式’，到处都有，”一个笑出了眼泪水的青年人用袖子揩揩眼睛。“我们社里有一个生产队长，也是有名的‘老把式’，跟你说的那位老伯伯正好是一对。54年7月里，棉区虫害严重。别的生产队都用药剂打虫，他不打，说是浪费。他有他的老经验：霉天雨水胜尿浇，伏里太阳赛火烧。他相信霉雨会把棉虫冲到地上，到伏里太阳一晒，就把虫晒死了。那年霉雨确实落个不停，可是伏里偏偏很少出太阳。棉虫给雨水‘浇’在地上了，但没有晒死，又爬到棉花上来了。结果别的生产队都增产，独有他一队减产。在评比会上，他脸孔发白，眼泪汪汪，说不出一句话来。
    听众又閧笑起来。我们两个也笑起来。
    “不过话得说回来，”富有表情的眼睛严肃起来了。“‘老把式’到底是‘老把式’，生产经验丰富哪。只要接受先进技术，就赛过几个年轻小伙子！”
    我们的谈话自然而然地转到先进技术上来了。他说，人活在世上，衣食住行一样少不得。棉花长在地上，也需要各种条件：一要通风，二要透光，条播就是为了通风透光，三要一定热度，四要一定水分，五要足够肥料。他说只要懂得这些道理，就会懂得先进科学技术的重要。我一句也搭不上腔，只是瞪眼睛。
    “我们常常说，田地产量是无底的，”他接着说，“这句话什么意思？我们世世代代的产量都是有底的，每亩地年年都收那么些斤籽棉，那么些斤稻子。只有学习科学知识，年年改进操作技术，产量才是真正无底的。要是不这样做，死抱住老经验，即使成立了合作社，产量还是有底的呀。”
    四
    列车在田野上奔驰，我们的谈话又转到领导工作上来了。我问他有什么体会，他想了想。
    “根据我们的经验，”他说，“领导上要紧紧抓住三件工作：一是总结经验，二是改进制度，三是打通思想。”
    据他说，当前突出的问题是工作质量问题。大家拚命挣工分，要是制度不健全，思想工作不细致，有些社员就要偷工减料。
    “我们年年总结经验，年年发现制度有漏洞。今年实行分片管理，从社到大队到中队到小组一直到个人，层层建立负责制，对全社的生产计划负责，同时还得搞好劳动定额。这样既能保证工作质量，又能充分发挥社员劳动积极性。”
    他特别强调思想教育工作的重要性。他说，教育工作一定要细，一点不能简单化，要重视群众自己的经验，要用事实教育群众，不能空口说白话。他对这一点体会最深。他举了几个例子。
    例如有几户中农入社后怕别人干活不如自己，怕自己吃亏，劳动劲头一直不大，横说竖说没有用。后来管理委员会组织他们去检查别人干的活，他们认为不合格的要重新做过。他们一检查，大吃一惊，发觉应该重新做过的正是他们自己做的活。他们非但安了心，而且把自己所有钞票都给了合作社作为生产投资了。
      “只要教育工作做得好，就没有真正落后的社员！”他说“领导人要时时刻刻利用几样东西：一双眼睛、两只耳朵、一个脑子、一个算盘。用眼睛和耳朵了解干部和社员的思想情况，用脑子分析情况，再用算盘来打破他们的思想顾虑。这样做，万无一失！”
    他拉住话头，眯细眼睛，显然还在思索着什么。
    “还有一点非常重要，”他接着说。“队长组长一定要在生产中带头，不能盘着两腿指挥别人，要这个用劲干，要那个用劲跑。要是这样，社员就会说你是大老板、小老板，不买你账。话说得再漂亮，也没有用。我们社有些生产队就发生过这样情况。你能说社员说得不对吗？这样队长组长不是大老板、小老板是什么！”
    从他的深刻而生动的话语中，我汲取了多少经验和智慧！要不是亲身接触到他，哪里知道在党领导下的优秀农民干部“跑马”到底跑得多远了。
    在列车前进的轰隆声中，我们的谈话继续着。谈到勤俭办社的方针的时候，他那富有表情的眼睛又显得特别活跃了。
    “我常常想，”他说，“只要每个干部每个社员都把合作社真正看作大家庭，都像对待自己家务一样对待社务，克勤克俭，那就好了。可是眼前还做不到呀，这是大问题。社员看见年年增产，个人收入年年增加，就说吃点喝点没有什么。怎会‘没有什么’呢？个人乱花钱，不重视生产投资，就要影响社的发展，影响个人来年的收入。至于社的领导干部更要抓紧开支，社大了，你手头一松，几千元就飞了！……”
    列车突然呜呜地叫了几声，接着弹动了几下，停在一个站头上了。我的邻座不得不停住话头。他站起来，同我紧紧握了握手，离开了。我隔着玻璃窗目送着夹在人丛中的他的瘦长的背影，他那斩钉截铁的声音仿佛仍在我的耳边响着：“只要教育工作做得好，就没有真正落后的社员！”
    列车又继续前进了：轰隆隆，轰隆隆。
