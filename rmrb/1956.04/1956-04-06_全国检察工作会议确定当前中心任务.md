Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The Third National Procuratorial Work Conference, which opened on March 19th, concluded on April 1st.

The conference summarized the procuratorial work of 1955, and after full discussion, determined the tasks for 1956. The conference pointed out that the central task of the current procuratorial work is to: take advantage of the current favorable situation and conditions to further deepen the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries and combat other illegal and criminal elements, especially with the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives and joint state-private enterprises, to strengthen the struggle against illegal and criminal phenomena that may occur within enterprises and cooperatives, to centrally crack down on all illegal and criminal activities that undermine socialist construction and socialist transformation, and to effectively prevent and overcome the phenomena of wrongful arrests and prosecutions, so as to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation and protect the democratic rights of the people. To this end, the conference determined that the professional development of people's procuratorates at all levels in 1956 should be based on the existing work, and that the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases should be rapidly improved, while at the same time, efforts should be made to carry out other professional work.

The conference emphasized that in the current struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, the policy of leniency for confession, severity for resistance, commutation for meritorious service, and rewards for great meritorious service should be conscientiously implemented. Therefore, all counter-revolutionaries who confess or surrender themselves and are verified should be treated leniently, and given commutation or exemption from punishment according to their specific circumstances. For those counter-revolutionaries who not only confess their own problems, but also report and render meritorious service, they should be given commutation or appropriate rewards according to their specific circumstances. On the other hand, those counter-revolutionaries who persist in their counter-revolutionary stance, refuse to confess, and are determined to be enemies of the people, and criminals with serious crimes, must be severely punished according to law.

The conference adopted the report on the summary of procuratorial work in 1955 and the tasks for 1956, as well as the plan for procuratorial work in 1956. The conference also discussed the 1956-1957 procuratorial work plan formulated by the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

    全国检察工作会议确定当前中心任务
    据新华社5日讯　在三月十九日召开的第三次全国检察工作会议，已经在四月一日结束。
    会议总结了1955年的检察工作，并经过充分讨论，确定了1956年的工作任务。会议指出，当前检察工作的中心任务是：利用目前有利的形势和条件，更加深入地开展肃清反革命分子的斗争和打击其他违法犯罪分子的斗争，特别是随着农业生产合作社和公私合营企业的发展，要加强与企业、合作社内部可能发生的违法犯罪现象进行斗争，集中地打击一切破坏社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的违法犯罪活动，并且切实地防止和克服错捕、错起诉的现象，以保障社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，保护人民的民主权利。为此，会议确定1956年各级人民检察院的业务建设，应当是在已有的工作基础上，迅速地把刑事案件的侦查、起诉工作健全起来，同时，努力开展其他各项业务工作。
    会议强调指出，在目前的肃清反革命分子的斗争中，应当认真执行坦白从宽、抗拒从严、立功折罪、立大功受奖的政策。因此，对于凡是坦白交代或自首投案经过查实的反革命分子，都应当按从宽的原则处理，分别具体情况给以减刑或者免刑。对于不仅坦白了自己的问题，而且又能检举并立了功的反革命分子，应当分别具体情况，将功折罪或者给予适当奖励。另一方面，对于那些坚持反革命立场、拒不坦白，坚决与人民为敌的反革命分子和有严重罪行的犯罪分子，必须依法严惩。
    会议通过了关于1955年检察工作的总结和1956年的工作任务的报告以及1956年检察工作计划。会议还讨论了最高人民检察院制定的1956—1957年检察工作规划。
