Don't Lightly Allow Students With Professional Skills to Change Careers
Editor's Note: The situation reflected in the letter from Comrade Huang Qiao of the Beijing Institute of Geology and thirty-five students is correct. According to our understanding, after the Ministry of Geology borrowed a group of students from the Beijing Institute of Geology and the Northeast Institute of Geology ahead of schedule to participate in field internships based on the original work plan, the work tasks increased again. Therefore, when the Central South Geological Bureau and the Southwest Geological Bureau assigned work to the borrowed students, they did not properly consider the students' majors, but required some students to change careers. After the students raised their opinions, the Ministry of Geology instructed the Central South and Southwest Geological Bureaus to reassign the students' work and not let them change careers.

Currently, the technical strength of our country's field geological work cannot meet the needs of the work. There are indeed some difficulties in the personnel arrangement of the field work teams; however, precisely because of this, we should use the technical strength more rationally and give full play to the role of existing personnel. Lightly allowing students who have come to the field for internships ahead of schedule to change careers will not only make it difficult for them to be competent in the new work due to unfamiliarity, but will also make their internships fail to achieve the due effect, and even waste the professional knowledge they originally studied during the internship. This is not beneficial to the current work, but is very detrimental to the cause of cultivating new technical forces. Now the Ministry of Geology has instructed its affiliated units to correct this practice, but in the case of insufficient technical strength, it is easy to deviate from only considering the immediate convenience and disregarding the long-term interests in the assignment of technical personnel. Therefore, this issue deserves universal attention to prevent similar situations from occurring.

　　(1) Editor Comrade:

　　Not long ago, the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Higher Education jointly issued instructions to borrow 240 students from our school ahead of schedule for field internships to participate in national geological survey and exploration work (for a period of one year). Due to the urgent need for work, this group of students hurriedly left the school in February and reported to the relevant units.

　　However, after these students arrived at the Central South Geological Bureau and the Southwest Geological Bureau, these two agencies did not immediately assign them work. The Central South Geological Bureau did nothing except hold a welcome meeting and have them fill out a form. On the afternoon of the 25th, the bureau notified them that they would intensively study Russian for twenty days and then work with Soviet experts. The students were very happy. However, after studying Russian for only a week or so, the bureau suddenly ordered these students to leave immediately to participate in other work. At this time, the students had no objections in order to obey the needs of the work. Who knew that the next day, the director of the cadre department wanted them to change careers to participate in exploration work. When the students raised their opinions, the comrades in the cadre department also said that surveying and exploration are the same major and there is not much difference.

　　I think it is wrong for the Central South Geological Bureau and the Southwest Geological Bureau to ask the students to change careers. I suggest that the Ministry of Geology inspect this matter and resolve it properly.

　　Huang Qiao, Deputy Director of the Dean's Office of Beijing Institute of Geology

　　(2) Editor Comrade:

　　We were originally students of the Beijing Institute of Geology and were recently borrowed to work at the Southwest Geological Bureau. We should have graduated this summer, but due to work needs, the school compressed the courses and decided to postpone the graduation thesis for one year, allowing us to come to the field for an internship one year in advance. When we were about to leave, the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Geology also explained to us the urgency of the task and asked us to report as soon as possible. Therefore, we did not dare to stay for a moment and quickly came to the Southwest Geological Bureau.

　　However, after arriving in Chongqing, we stayed at the guest house of the Southwest Geological Bureau for ten days, and no one came to inquire at all. Not long after, the cadre department of the Southwest Geological Bureau assigned us work. Among our thirty-five people, some studied metal deposit exploration, and some studied geological survey and prospecting; however, most people were assigned to engage in coalfield exploration work. We raised our opinions on this unreasonable phenomenon of work assignment, but the responsible comrades of the cadre department said: "It is impossible for learning and application to be completely consistent, and minor career changes are inevitable. Since you are college students, you should know everything, this is called 'all-round development'!" They repeatedly emphasized that the task of coalfield exploration in the Southwest is very heavy and insisted that we obey the "needs" of the work.

　　We do not agree with this statement of the Southwest Geological Bureau. We have very little exposure to courses in coalfield exploration in school. If we are now asked to engage in coalfield exploration work, not only will the professional knowledge learned in school be wasted, but we will also be unable to be competent in the new work. This is not conducive to improving our work level, and it is also not beneficial to the country's socialist construction. We request the Ministry of Geology to urge the Southwest Geological Bureau to correct this unreasonable practice of using personnel.

    不要轻易地让有专业的学生改行
    编者按：北京地质学院黄桥同志和三十五个学生来信所反映的情况是正确的。据我们了解，地质部在根据原订工作计划向北京地质学院和东北地质学院借调一批学生提前参加野外实习以后，工作任务又有所增加，于是中南地质局和西南地质局在对借调的学生分配工作的时候就没有妥善地考虑学生所学的专业，而要求一部分学生改行。经学生提出意见以后，地质部已指示中南、西南两地质局重新分配学生的工作，不必让他们改行。
    目前我国野外地质工作的技术力量还不能满足工作的需要，在野外工作队的人员安排上的确有着一些困难；但是，正因为如此，就应该更加合理地使用技术力量，充分发挥现有人员的作用。轻易让提前到野外实习的学生改行，不但会使他们对新的工作因为不熟悉而难以胜任，而且还会使他们的实习得不到应有的效果，甚至在实习期间荒废了原学的专业知识。这对当前工作没有什么好处，而对培养新生技术力量的事业则很不利。现在地质部已经指示所属单位纠正了这种做法，但是在技术力量不足的情况下，在分配技术人员的工作中很容易发生只顾眼前方便而不顾长远利益的偏差，因此，这个问题值得引起普遍的重视，以防止类似情况的发生。
    （一）编辑同志：
    不久以前，地质部和高等教育部曾联名发出指示，要借调我校240名学生提前到野外实习，参加国家地质普查勘探工作（期限是一年）。由于工作需要很迫切，这批学生在二月份匆忙地离开了学校，分别到有关单位去报到了。
    但是，这些学生到了中南地质局和西南地质局以后，这两个机关并没有立刻给他们分配工作。中南地质局除了召开一个欢迎会和让他们填一张表格以外，其他一点事也没做。到二十五日下午，局方通知他们，要突击学习二十天俄文，然后和苏联专家一起工作。同学们都很高兴。但是，俄文才学了个把星期，局方突然又命令这些同学立即出发去参加另外的工作。这时，同学们为了服从工作需要，也并没有意见。谁知道第二天干部处处长却要他们改行去参加勘探工作。同学们提出意见，干部处的同志还说普查、勘探这两个专业都一样，没有多大分别。
    我认为，中南地质局和西南地质局要同学们改行的做法是不对的。建议地质部检查这件事情，并加以妥善的解决。

    （二）编辑同志：
    我们原来是北京地质学院的学生，不久以前才被借调到西南地质局工作。我们应该在今年暑假毕业，但是由于工作需要，校方把课程压缩了一下，并且决定把毕业论文推迟一年再写，让我们提前到野外实习一年。在临走的时候，地质部负责同志还对我们说明任务紧急的情况，要我们赶快去报到。因此，我们一刻也不敢停留，很快地来到了西南地质局。
    但是，到重庆以后，我们在西南地质局的招待所一住就是十天，根本没有人来过问。不久以后，西南地质局干部处给我们分配工作了。我们三十五个人中，有学金属矿床勘探的，有学地质调查和找矿的；可是大部分人却被分配去搞煤田勘探工作。我们对这种分配工作的不合理现象提出意见，干部处的负责同志却说：“学用不可能完全一致，小改行是免不了的。既然是大学生，就应该什么都会，这样才叫‘全面发展’！”他们一再强调西南煤田勘探的任务很重，坚持要我们服从工作“需要”。
    我们不同意西南地质局这种说法。我们在学校里对煤田勘探方面的课程接触得很少，如果现在要我们去搞煤田勘探工作，不但在学校里学的专业知识要荒废掉，而且也不能胜任新的工作。这对我们提高工作水平是不利的，对国家的社会主义建设也是没有好处的。我们要求地质部督促西南地质局纠正这种使用人员的不合理做法。
