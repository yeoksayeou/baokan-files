    More than 300 people, including soldiers from the People's Liberation Army stationed locally and young members of the Gushan Agricultural Production Cooperative, participated in the evening party. Members of the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who came to the coastal defense front to give comfort performances, and local garrison soldiers performed more than 20 music and dance programs for the members. Wang Ximei and Guo Baojin, young members of the Gushan Agricultural Production Cooperative, also performed mountain songs about wasteland reclamation and production that they had composed themselves.
    The People's Liberation Army soldiers and the youth of the Gushan Agricultural Production Cooperative have established a deep friendship. Not long ago, they jointly established a Youth Friendship Club, and the company's soldiers donated a large number of books and established a library in the club. They also signed a contract for mutual support in production and war service. The soldiers' shock team to support agricultural cooperation has helped the cooperative build more than 200 meters of drainage ditch for water pumps and accumulated more than 5,000 loads of fertilizer in the past month or so; they have also helped the cooperative organize a people's school, where soldiers take turns teaching members to read every night.

    周末军民联欢晚会
    福州市郊后屿乡三月三十一日晚举行了一个周末军民联欢晚会。
    中国人民解放军驻当地部队的战士和鼓山农业生产合作社青年社员共三百多人参加了这个晚会。前来海防前线作慰问演出的中国人民解放军总政治部文工团的团员们和当地驻军战士为社员们表演了二十多个音乐、舞蹈节目。鼓山农业生产合作社青年社员王细妹、郭宝金也表演了她们自己编的开荒生产的山歌。
    人民解放军战士同鼓山农业生产合作社的青年已经建立了深厚的友谊。不久前，他们曾联合成立了一个青年友谊俱乐部，连队战士赠送大批图书，在这个俱乐部里建立了图书室。他们还签订了生产、战勤相互支援的合同。战士们的支援农业合作化生产突击队，一个多月来已经帮助社里修了二百多公尺长的抽水机沟渠，积了五千多担肥料；还帮助合作社组织民校，每晚由战士们轮流教给社员识字。
