The Irresistible "Bandung Spirit"
    Shao Zonghan
    A year ago today, representatives of twenty-nine Asian and African countries gathered in Bandung, a beautiful city in Indonesia, to hold the first Asian-African Conference in history without the participation of Western colonial countries. More than 1.6 billion Asian and African people excitedly listened to the voice from the conference: Let the new Asia and new Africa be born!
    The Asian-African Conference proved that Asian and African countries with common experiences and situations, despite their different social systems, religious beliefs, and lifestyles, should and can peacefully coexist, respect each other, and support each other in order to eradicate the scourge of colonialism, develop their own economies, and improve the living standards of their people. The fate of the Asian and African people should be controlled by the Asian and African people themselves. The Asian-African Conference prominently reflected the spirit of awakening and unity of the Asian and African people. People call this great spirit embodied by the Asian-African Conference the "Bandung Spirit."
    In the past year, the people of Asian and African countries have made tremendous efforts to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference. The influence of the "Bandung Spirit" has been developing and expanding. It is playing an increasingly important role in the foreign policies and mutual relations of Asian and African countries. In the vast regions of Asia and Africa, the struggle for peace, independence, and strengthened international cooperation continues to achieve new victories.
    As a major world power, India has become an increasingly important factor in world affairs, especially in Asian-African relations. Together with Burma, Indonesia, and other Asian and African countries, India resolutely implements a policy of peace, opposes military alliances, promotes international cooperation, and expands the peace zone in Asia and Africa, thereby making an important contribution to easing international tensions. In Indochina, the Royal Government of Cambodia has rejected the "protection" of military blocs organized by Western countries and insists on a policy of peaceful neutrality. It is waging a heroic struggle against foreign interference and pressure and to safeguard its national sovereignty and dignity. Not long ago, the new government of the Kingdom of Laos also announced that it would abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and expressed its willingness to establish peaceful and friendly relations with its neighbors. Afghanistan and Nepal have also repeatedly stated that they will pursue a policy of neutrality and promote friendly exchanges with all countries. Recently, in the elections in Ceylon, the People's United Front won a victory, and the new government of Ceylon has affirmed that it will pursue a neutral policy of not participating in Western military blocs.
    The political situation in a few Asian countries that have joined military blocs is also undergoing remarkable changes. Public opinion in these countries has sharply raised the question: What are the benefits of Asian countries joining the military blocs of Western countries, other than deepening the divisions in the region, increasing the burden on their own people, and infringing upon their own sovereignty and interests? Why not break free from the current predicament, cooperate friendly with other countries, and jointly promote peace and prosperity in this region? Therefore, in countries such as Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines, more and more people are demanding the implementation of policies that conform to national interests. Just citing the recent resolution unanimously passed by the Philippine Congress requesting a re-examination of U.S.-Philippine relations can reflect the changes taking place in the political climate of these countries.
    The achievements of the Asian-African Conference and the development of the overall situation in Asia cannot but have an impact on Japan. It has made Japan increasingly deeply aware that Japan should not continue to submit to the United States and become an "orphan" in Asia, but should implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and become a member of the Asian family of nations. The Japanese people and far-sighted politicians are increasingly strongly demanding that the Japanese government pursue an independent and autonomous foreign policy and get rid of foreign control and interference. People from all walks of life in Japan, including some members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, are launching a broad movement to strive for the normalization of Japanese-Chinese and Japanese-Soviet relations. Not long ago, the Japanese House of Representatives passed a resolution requesting the Japanese government to adapt to the development of the international situation and promote Japanese-Chinese trade.
    In the Middle East, Arab countries, led by Egypt, have waged a heroic struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and national independence and to oppose the aggressive tool manufactured by Western colonial countries—the Baghdad Pact. Despite the most brutal pressure and threats exerted by Western colonial countries on countries such as Syria and Jordan, they have repeatedly refused to join the Baghdad Pact. Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Yemen have made the same statements. Not long ago, Jordan removed the British General Glubb, who had controlled the "Arab Legion" for nearly twenty years and was regarded as the emperor of Jordan, which fully reflects the upsurge of the anti-colonialist movement of the people in the Middle East. In these struggles, the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab countries has been increasingly strengthened. The Arab countries can no longer tolerate Western colonial countries arbitrarily interfering in Middle Eastern affairs or deciding on any major issues in the Middle East, especially the Palestine issue, without the participation and consent of the Arab countries. For the sake of their own national interests and the interests of peace in the Middle East, the Arab countries, regardless of the obstruction and opposition of Western countries, are establishing and developing friendly relations with socialist countries and actively participating in international cooperation. Today, Arab countries such as Egypt have become a new and important factor in international affairs.
    Since the Asian-African Conference, great changes have also taken place in Africa and are continuing to take place. On January 1, 1955, Sudan declared itself an independent republic. Shortly thereafter, Morocco and Tunisia also declared independence. Although these countries still face the difficult task of consolidating their national sovereignty and developing their national economies, achieving political independence is, after all, a decisive first step on the road to national rejuvenation.
    Throughout the Asian-African region, the struggle for and maintenance of national independence is flourishing. The people of Algeria, Cyprus, Malaya, Singapore, Uganda, Kenya, and other places are fighting to achieve national self-determination. The people of India and Indonesia are fighting to recover sovereignty over Goa and West Irian. At the Tenth United Nations General Assembly, the Asian and African countries formed a strong force and waged a sharp struggle against the Western colonial countries on many issues related to human rights and national rights. These victories achieved by the national self-determination and national independence movements are the result of the long-term struggle of the people of the relevant Asian and African countries, and they are also the result of the expansion of the influence of the "Bandung Spirit." Even Western news agencies admit this, and they say in horror that the anti-colonialist movement of Asian and African countries "has gained new momentum due to the unity gained by the Bandung Conference," and "the huge echo of the Bandung Conference" can also be heard at the United Nations General Assembly.
    In the past year, the people of Asian and African countries who have already gained political independence have also made many achievements in consolidating their independence. They generally demand the elimination of the heavy consequences caused by long-term colonial rule and the development of independent national economies. Western colonial countries are trying to take advantage of the various difficulties encountered by newly independent countries to maintain and restore unequal economic relations and colonial exploitation under the guise of "economic assistance." However, more and more Asian and African people understand that relying on this kind of "assistance" to develop their own economies is tantamount to "drinking poison to quench thirst." They realize that they must establish their own economic foundation and formulate plans for the development of the national economy. They realize that they must develop economic cooperation relations with Asian and African countries in accordance with the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference on economic cooperation. They further realize that they must strive for the sincere assistance of other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. As everyone knows, the socialist country, the Soviet Union, with its strong industry and advanced technology, is willing to help economically backward countries develop their independent national economies and achieve industrialization without any conditions attached. In recent years, the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, Afghanistan, and some Arab countries has fully proved this. This situation has fundamentally changed the situation in which Western colonial countries monopolize "aid" to backward countries. Obviously, the development of economic cooperation between socialist countries and Asian and African countries and among Asian and African countries is fully in line with the "Bandung Spirit."
    With the expansion of the influence of the "Bandung Spirit," friendly visits and contacts between government leaders and people of Asian and African countries have also become increasingly frequent. These friendly visits and contacts help to enhance mutual understanding and cooperation among Asian and African countries.
    In the past year, China has greatly developed friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Asian-African Conference. China's relations with India, Burma, and Indonesia have been further strengthened after the Asian-African Conference, both in terms of promoting international peace and in terms of economic and cultural cooperation. China has established normal diplomatic relations with Afghanistan and Nepal on the basis of the Five Principles. China's friendly relations with Pakistan have also seen significant improvement after the Asian-African Conference. Although China has not yet established diplomatic relations with Egypt and other Arab and African countries, cultural and economic contacts and exchanges are developing rapidly.
    China has not yet established normal diplomatic relations with some of its Asian neighbors. The Chinese government and people have made sincere efforts to increase contact with these countries. The visits of Cambodian Prince Sihanouk, the Thai People's Friendship Delegation, and many Japanese people's organizations and political figures to China have been warmly welcomed by our people.
    As everyone knows, Asian and African countries not only show unprecedented mutual concern and support for common issues within the Asian-African region, but also have an increasingly important impact on international affairs. In today's world, without the participation of Asian and African countries, it is no longer possible to solve any major international problems, especially major international problems related to Asian and African countries.
    The convening of the Asian-African Conference and its achievements reflect the historic changes in the Asian-African region: the old era in which the Asian and African people were dominated and enslaved by Western colonial forces has ended, and the new era in which the Asian and African people are masters of their own affairs has begun. The "Bandung Spirit" is a reflection of this historical trend, and it is irresistible!

    不可阻挡的“万隆精神”
    邵宗汉
    去年的今天，二十九个亚非国家的代表们在印度尼西亚的美丽城市——万隆齐集一堂，召开了历史上第一次没有西方殖民国家参加的亚非会议。十六亿以上的亚非人民兴奋地倾听着从大会上发出的声音：让新亚洲和新非洲诞生吧！
    亚非会议证明，有着共同经历和境遇的亚非国家，尽管社会制度，宗教信仰，生活习惯各不相同，但是，为了铲除殖民主义的祸害，为了发展自己的经济，为了提高人民的生活水平，他们不仅应当而且完全可能和平共处，互相尊重，互相支持。亚非人民的命运应当由亚非人民自己来掌握。亚非会议突出地反映了亚非人民的觉醒和团结的精神。人们把亚非会议所体现的这种伟大的精神叫做“万隆精神”。
    一年以来，亚非各国人民为了贯彻亚非会议的决议，作了巨大的努力。“万隆精神”的影响日益发展和扩大。它在亚非国家的对外政策和相互关系中起着越来越重要的作用。在亚非广大地区，争取和平、独立和加强国际合作的斗争不断得到新的胜利。
    作为世界一个大国，印度在世界事务中特别是在亚非关系中成为日益重要的因素。印度同缅甸、印度尼西亚和其他亚非国家一起，坚决执行和平政策，反对军事联盟，促进国际合作，扩大亚非的和平地区，从而对缓和国际紧张局势作了重要的贡献。在印度支那，柬埔寨王国政府拒绝了西方国家所组织的军事集团的“保护”，坚持和平中立政策。它为了反对外来的干涉和压力，为了维护自己的民族主权和尊严，正在进行英勇的斗争。不久以前，老挝王国的新政府也宣布遵守和平共处的五项原则，并表示愿意同邻国建立和平友好关系。阿富汗和尼泊尔也一再表示实行中立政策，并促进同各国之间的友好来往。最近，在锡兰的选举中，人民联合阵线取得了胜利，锡兰新政府肯定地表示将奉行不参加西方军事集团的中立政策。
    参加了军事集团的少数亚洲国家的政治情况，也正发生着令人注目的变化。这些国家的舆论尖锐地提出这样的质问：亚洲国家参加西方国家的军事集团，除了加深这个地区的分裂，加重本国人民的负担，并使本国的主权和利益遭受侵犯以外，究竟有什么好处呢？为什么不摆脱目前被束缚的困境，同其他国家友好合作，共同促进这个地区的和平和繁荣呢？因此，在巴基斯坦、泰国、菲律宾这些国家中，越来越多的人们要求实行符合民族利益的政策。只要举出菲律宾国会最近一致通过要求重新审查美菲关系的决议这一件事情，就可以反映这些国家的政治气候正在发生的变化。
    亚非会议的成就和整个亚洲局势的发展，当然不能不对日本也发生影响。它使日本越来越深切地认识到，日本不应该继续屈从美国，成为亚洲的“孤儿”，而应该实行亚非会议的决议，成为亚洲国家大家庭的一员。日本人民和有远见的政治家，日益强烈地要求日本政府执行独立自主的外交政策，摆脱外国的控制和干涉。日本各阶层人士，包括执政的自由民主党的一部分人士在内，正展开广泛的运动，争取日中、日苏关系的正常化。不久以前，日本众议院曾通过决议，要求日本政府适应国际形势的发展，促进日中贸易。
    在中近东，以埃及为首的阿拉伯国家为了维护国家主权和民族独立，为了反对西方殖民国家所制造的侵略工具——巴格达条约，进行了英勇的斗争。尽管西方殖民国家对叙利亚、约旦等国家施行了最粗暴的压力和威胁，但是它们仍一再拒绝参加巴格达条约。沙特阿拉伯、黎巴嫩和也门作了同样的表示。不久以前，约旦解除了控制“阿拉伯军团”近二十年并被目为约旦的太上皇的英国将军格拉布的职务这充分地反映了中近东人民反对殖民主义运动的高涨。在这些斗争中，埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯以及其他一些阿拉伯国家之间的团结互助精神日益加强。阿拉伯国家不能再容忍西方殖民国家任意干涉中近东事务，或者在没有阿拉伯国家参加和同意的情况下来决定中近东的任何重大问题，特别是巴勒斯坦问题。为了民族自身的利益和中近东和平的利益，阿拉伯国家不顾西方国家的阻挠和反对，正同社会主义国家建立并发展友好关系，积极参加国际合作事业。今天，埃及等阿拉伯国家已经成为国际事务中的一个新的重要因素。
    亚非会议以来，非洲也发生了很大的变化，并正在继续发生着变化。1955年1月1日，苏丹宣布为独立的共和国。过了不久，摩洛哥和突尼斯也宣布独立。尽管在这些国家的面前还摆着巩固自己国家主权和发展民族经济的困难任务，但是取得了政治上的独立毕竟是走上民族复兴道路的带有决定性的第一步。
    在整个亚非地区，争取和维护民族独立的斗争正在蓬勃发展。阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、马来亚、新加坡、乌干达、怯尼亚以及其他地方的人民，都在为实现民族自决而斗争。印度和印度尼西亚的人民正为收复果阿和西伊里安的主权而斗争。在第十届联合国大会上，亚非各国形成了一支强大的力量，在有关人权和民族权利的许多问题上，同西方殖民国家进行了尖锐的斗争。民族自决和民族独立运动所取得的这些胜利，是亚非有关国家人民长期奋斗的结果，同时也是“万隆精神”影响扩大的结果。甚至西方通讯社也承认这一点，它们惊恐地说：亚非国家的反殖民主义运动“由于万隆会议获得的团结而有了新的动力”，在联合国大会上也“可以听到万隆会议的巨大回响”。
    一年来，已经获得政治独立的亚非各国人民，在巩固自己的独立方面也有了许多成就。他们普遍要求消除长期殖民统治所造成的沉重后果，发展独立的民族经济。西方殖民国家力图利用新近独立国家所遇到的种种困难，在“经济援助”的幌子下，保持和恢复不平等的经济关系和殖民剥削。但是，越来越多的亚非各国人民懂得，如果想依靠这种“援助”来发展自己的经济，无异于“饮鸩止渴”。他们认识到必须建立自己的经济基础，制定发展国民经济的建设计划。他们认识到必须根据亚非会议关于经济合作的决议，同亚非各国发展经济合作的关系。他们更认识到必须在平等和互利的基础上争取其他国家的真诚的援助。大家知道，拥有强大工业和先进技术的社会主义国家苏联，愿意不附带任何条件，帮助经济落后国家发展它们的独立的民族经济和实现工业化。近年来苏联同印度、缅甸、阿富汗以及同某些阿拉伯国家的经济合作就充分证明了这一点。这种情况就使西方殖民国家垄断对落后国家的“援助”的局面根本改观。很明显，社会主义国家同亚非国家之间以及亚非各国之间的经济合作关系的发展，是完全符合“万隆精神”的。
    随着“万隆精神”影响的扩大，亚非各国政府领袖和人民之间的友好访问和接触也日益频繁起来。这些友好访问和接触，有助于增进亚非各国之间的互相了解和合作。
    一年以来，中国根据和平共处五项原则和亚非会议的精神，大大地发展了同亚非国家之间的友好合作关系。中国同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚之间的关系，不论在促进国际和平方面，或者在经济文化合作方面，在亚非会议后都进一步增强了。中国同阿富汗、尼泊尔在五项原则的基础上建立了正常的外交关系。中国同巴基斯坦的友好关系，在亚非会议以后也有了显著的增进。中国同埃及和其他阿拉伯和非洲国家虽然还没有建交，但是文化经济方面的接触和来往正在迅速地向前发展。
    中国同一部分亚洲邻国也还没有建立正常的外交关系。中国政府和人民作了真诚的努力来增进同这些国家的接触。柬埔寨西哈努克亲王、泰国人民友好访华代表团以及日本许多人民团体和政界人物到中国的访问，受到我国人民的热烈欢迎。
    大家知道，亚非国家不仅对亚非地区内共同有关的问题，表现出前所未有的互相关心和支持，而且对国际事务也发生着日益重要的影响。在今天的世界上，没有亚非国家的参加，要想解决任何重大国际问题，特别是同亚非国家有关的重大国际问题，是再也不可能了。
    亚非会议的召开及其成就反映了亚非地区的历史性变化：亚非人民被西方殖民势力支配和奴役的旧时代已经结束，亚非人民当家作主的新时代已经开始。“万隆精神”是这一历史趋势的反映，它是不可阻挡的！
