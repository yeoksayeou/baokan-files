    Steps to Strengthen Friendly Cooperation Between China and Egypt

    As we celebrate the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference, the friendly cooperative relations between our country and the Arab Republic of Egypt have undergone new developments. During the visit of China's trade delegation to Egypt, a joint communiqué on the development of trade relations between China and Egypt was issued with the Egyptian government. Simultaneously, plenipotentiary representatives of the two countries signed the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Cooperation Agreement in Cairo. This is another concrete demonstration of our two countries sincerely implementing the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference.

    The resolution on economic cooperation of the Asian-African Conference emphasized that Asian and African countries should cooperate on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty to promote the economic development of the Asian-African region. Over the past year, China and Egypt have followed this spirit and made joint efforts to promote the independent economic development of the two countries, and have achieved great success. Our two countries have exchanged trade delegations for visits, and signed a trade agreement and a protocol for the first agreement year in August 1955. The joint communiqué of the two countries' trade talks shows that the governments of both countries are satisfied with the implementation of the trade agreement and the protocol. During the visit of our trade delegation to Egypt, both parties completed a trade volume of nearly four million pounds. China purchased a large amount of Egyptian cotton yarn, and Egypt purchased Chinese steel, machinery, and vegetable oil. This illustrates the mutually beneficial nature and broad development prospects of our two countries' trade relations.

    To ensure the continuous development of trade relations between the two countries, in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Egyptian trade agreement, our two countries have established government commercial representative offices in each other's countries and have held commodity exhibitions in each other's countries. China's commodity exhibition, which started in Cairo on April 1, has been warmly welcomed by the Egyptian business community and the people. These measures by the two governments will surely promote greater development of trade relations between the two countries.

    The signing of the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Cooperation Agreement is also the result of the efforts made by the governments of our two countries to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and further develop the summary of talks on cultural cooperation between the two countries signed last year.

    The resolution on cultural cooperation of the Asian-African Conference pointed out that developing cultural cooperation is one of the most powerful tools for promoting understanding between countries. The strengthening of cultural cooperation between China and Egypt fully confirms the correctness of this assertion. In the past year, many religious, political and legal, academic, and journalistic figures and groups from Egypt have been invited to visit China, and Chinese religious and academic figures and groups have also visited Egypt. China's cultural and art delegation's performance in Egypt not long ago was widely praised by all sectors of Egyptian society. The facts most clearly prove that the mutual learning and observation between our two countries in the cultural field has enhanced mutual understanding between the two peoples, established and developed the sincere friendship between the two peoples, and enriched the inherent splendid cultures of the two countries. After the implementation of the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Cooperation Agreement, our two countries' cultural exchanges will be more prosperous, thereby further promoting the close friendship between our two peoples, which is very important for the cause of world peace.

    While the friendly relations between China and Egypt are being established and developed, the friendship and cooperation between our country and other Arab countries in the Middle East and North Africa have also greatly increased. China has concluded trade agreements with Syria and Lebanon, and China's Islamic Hajj delegation and trade delegation have successively visited Saudi Arabia. After the visit of China's trade delegation to the Republic of Sudan, China's cultural and art delegation went to Sudan for a visit and performance. Friendly exchanges have also begun between the Chinese people and the Tunisian people.

    The development of friendly cooperative relations between China and Egypt and other Arab countries proves that the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference on strengthening mutual trust and peaceful cooperation among Asian and African countries have great practical significance, and it fully conforms to the interests and wishes of the people of Asian and African countries. The Chinese people cherish the friendship and cooperation that has now been established with the Egyptian people and the people of other Arab countries, and hope to further consolidate and develop this close friendship and cooperation on this basis, so as to jointly make greater contributions to expanding the area of peace and promoting the economic and cultural prosperity of the Asian-African region.

    加强中埃友好合作的步骤
    在庆祝亚非会议一周年纪念的时候，我国同埃及共和国之间的友好合作关系又有了新的发展。我国贸易访问团在埃及访问期间，同埃及政府发表了关于发展中埃两国贸易关系的会谈公报。同时，两国全权代表在开罗签订了中埃文化合作协定。这是我们两国真诚地执行亚非会议决议的新的具体表现。
    亚非会议关于经济合作的决议，强调亚非各国在平等互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上实行合作，来促进亚非区域的经济发展。一年来，中埃两国遵循着这个精神，为促进两国经济的独立发展进行了共同的努力，并取得了很大的成就。我们两国互相派遣了贸易代表团进行访问，在1955年8月签订了两国之间的贸易协定和第一个协定年度的议定书。这次两国贸易会谈公报表明，两国政府对贸易协定和议定书的执行情况都表示满意。就在我国贸易访问团访问埃及这个时期，双方就完成了将近四百万英镑的贸易额。我国购买了大量埃及棉纱，埃及购买了我国的钢材、机器和植物油。这说明我们两国的贸易关系的互惠性质和宽广的发展前途。
    为保证两国贸易关系的不断发展，根据中埃贸易协定的规定，我们两国互相在对方国家设立了政府的商务代表处，并互相在对方国家举行商品展览。我国商品展览会从四月一日起正在开罗举行，受到了埃及工商界和人民的热烈欢迎。两国政府的这些措施，必将促进两国贸易关系的更大发展。
    中埃文化合作协定的签订，同样是我们两国政府为贯彻亚非会议的决议，进一步发展我们两国在去年签订的关于两国文化合作会谈纪要所作的努力的结果。
    亚非会议关于文化合作的决议指出，发展文化合作是促进各国之间的谅解的最有力的工具之一。中埃两国文化合作的加强，完全证实了这一论断的正确性。在过去一年间，埃及的许多宗教、政法、学术和新闻界的人士和团体应邀到我国进行了访问，我国的宗教、学术界人士和团体也访问了埃及。我国的文化艺术代表团不久以前在埃及的访问演出，得到了埃及各界的广泛好评。事实最清楚不过的证明了，我们两国之间在文化方面的互相学习和观摩，已经增进了两国人民的互相了解，建立和发展了两国人民的真诚友谊，并丰富了两国固有的灿烂的文化。在中埃文化合作协定实施以后，我们两国的文化交流将会更加昌盛，从而进一步促进我们两国人民之间的密切友谊，这对于世界的和平事业是十分重要的。
    在中埃两国友好关系的建立和日益发展的同时，我国同中近东以及北非的其他阿拉伯国家之间的友谊和合作，也有了极大的增进。我国同叙利亚、黎巴嫩都缔结了贸易协定，我国伊斯兰教朝觐团和贸易访问团曾先后访问了沙特阿拉伯。在我国贸易访问团访问苏丹共和国之后，我国文化艺术代表团又到了苏丹进行访问演出。我国人民同突尼斯人民之间也开始了友好往来。
    我国同埃及和其他阿拉伯国家之间的友好合作关系的发展，证明了亚非会议关于加强亚非各国互相信任和和平合作的各项决议具有极大的现实意义，它完全符合亚非各国人民的利益和愿望。我国人民十分珍视同埃及人民和其他阿拉伯国家人民现在已经建立起来的友谊和合作关系，并希望在这个基础上进一步巩固和发展这种密切的友谊和合作，从而共同对扩大和平地区和促进亚非区域的经济、文化繁荣作出更大的贡献。
