Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 21st. During the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan, it will build atomic power stations with a total generating capacity of 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 kilowatts. Among them, two are in the Urals, with a total generating capacity of 1,000,000 kilowatts, and one is near Moscow, with a generating capacity of 400,000 kilowatts. To achieve this plan, the Soviet Union will build about ten types of atomic reactors. These include fast neutron reactors, slow neutron reactors, and intermediate neutron reactors; reactors using graphite, beryllium, heavy water, and ordinary water as moderators; and reactors cooled by gas or metal. Their generating capacity ranges from 50 kilowatts to 200,000 kilowatts.

    All of this was said in a recent article published in "Literary Gazette" by the famous Soviet scientist Pokrovsky. This article discussed the prospects for peaceful use of atomic energy in the Soviet Union. Pokrovsky wrote: If you look at the map of the Soviet Union, you will notice the vast areas along the Arctic Ocean, with large amounts of mineral deposits. It is very important to establish large power centers in these areas that do not rely on fuel supplies from other regions. It is here that atomic power enters our planned economy.

    He said that mobile atomic power plants can play a significant role in improving the Arctic environment. They can link the issue of converting the entire Soviet Arctic fleet to using atomic engines, which is a matter we consider very important.

    An atomic-powered icebreaker is not only a means of transportation and a tool for dealing with ice, but also the powerful power of such a ship can make it a floating power station, serving the Arctic coast.

    Atomic energy may also be applied to maritime transport in the Arctic. There, there is a layer of still water between the ice on the sea surface and the seabed. In this layer, an atomic submarine can sail smoothly without unpleasant jolts, unaffected by wind or freezing. When the submarine wants to rise to the surface at a selected location, it only needs to use special torpedoes to break or drill through the ice.

    Pokrovsky said that atomic technology based on uranium and thorium can no longer be considered the latest and highest achievement. It seems that nuclear physics and technology based on the energy generated in the process of synthesizing light atomic nuclei using heavy hydrogen and lithium have far greater prospects. Every ton of ordinary water contains about forty cubic centimeters of heavy hydrogen. This seems small. However, the power generation capacity of each cubic centimeter of heavy hydrogen is equal to ten tons of petroleum. Another raw material useful for power generation is the lightest metal, lithium. Every ton of the earth's crust contains sixty-five cubic centimeters of this metal, and its power generation capacity is equal to one hundred tons of petroleum.

    The energy generated from heavy hydrogen and lithium is the result of a thermonuclear reaction. To produce a hydrogen nuclear reaction, a high temperature of several million degrees is required. Until now, this temperature can only be generated by one known source of heat - atomic explosions. We must learn to obtain this enormous energy without explosions. Controlled thermonuclear reactions will make it possible for us to obtain energy not from the atomic nuclei of rare elements such as uranium and titanium, but from the common hydrogen in nature, making it serve humanity.

### 苏联和平利用原子能的前景

    苏联和平利用原子能的前景
    新华社莫斯科21日电  苏联在第六个五年计划期间要建造总发电能力达二百万瓩到二百五十万瓩的原子发电站。其中有两座在乌拉尔，它们的发电能力共达一百万瓩；一座在莫斯科附近，它的发电能力有四十万瓩。为了实现这个计划，苏联将建造大约十种型式的原子反应堆。其中有快中子反应堆、慢中子反应堆和中速中子反应堆；有用石墨、铍、重水和普通的水作减速剂的反应堆；用气体或者用金属冷却的反应堆。它们的发电能力从五十瓩到二十万瓩不等。
    所有这些都是苏联著名科学家波克罗夫斯基最近在“文学报”上发表的一篇文章中说的。这篇文章谈到了苏联和平利用原子能的前景。波克罗夫斯基写道：如果你看苏联的地图的话，你会注意到沿着北冰洋的广阔地区，有着大量矿藏。在这些地区中建立不依靠其他地区供应燃料的巨大的动力中心是非常重要的。就在这里，原子电力进入了我们的计划经济。
    他说，可以移动的原子发电厂对改善北极的环境能起很大的作用。它们可以把整个苏联极地舰队改为使用原子引擎的问题联系起来，这是一个我们认为是非常重要的问题。
    一艘原子开动的破冰船不但是一种运输工具和一种对付冰块的工具，而且这样一艘船的强大动力可以使它成为一个浮动电力站，为北极海岸服务。
    原子能也可能应用到在北极的海上航运方面去。在那里海面的冰层和海底之间有一层静止的水，在这层水中一个原子潜水艇能够平稳地航行而没有不愉快的颠簸，不受风吹，冰冻的影响。当潜水艇要在选定的地点升上海面的时候，它只消用特别的鱼雷把冰炸开或是钻开就行了。
    波克罗夫斯基说，以铀和钍为基础的原子工艺学已经不能再被认为是最新和最高的成就了。看来以利用重氢和锂合成轻原子核的过程中发生出来的能为基础的核子物理学和工艺学前途还要远大得多。每一吨普通的水含有约四十公分的重氢。这看起来很少。可是每公分重氢的发电能力却等于十吨石油。另一种对发电有用的原料就是最轻的金属——锂。每一吨地壳含有六十五公分这种金属，它的发电能力等于一百吨石油。
    从重氢和锂产生的能是一种热核子反应的结果。为了产生氢核子反应，必须有几百万度的高温。到现在，这种温度还只能由人类所知道的一个热的来源——原子爆炸中产生出来。我们必须学会不用爆炸就取得这种巨大的能。受到控制的热核子反应将使我们有可能不再从像铀和钛这种稀少的原素的原子核而从自然界中常见的氢中间取得能，使它为人类服务。
