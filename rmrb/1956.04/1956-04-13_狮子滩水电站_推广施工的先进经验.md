Lion Beach Hydropower Station Engineering Bureau, in addition to deciding to promote nine advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and other regions, also organized technical personnel to systematically summarize forty-one advanced experiences that continuously emerged from various projects within the unit.

Now, these experiences have been basically mastered by all employees of the bureau, and have significantly improved construction efficiency and quality. The workers constructing the main spillway project learned and promoted twelve important advanced experiences related to excavation, stone masonry, and construction management in March. As a result, the work efficiency of five projects was significantly improved throughout the month. Among them, the actual completed earth excavation project increased by three and a half times compared to the monthly plan; the mortar rubble masonry project increased by 1.6 times compared to the monthly plan.

Electric welders constructing the main project—the water diversion tunnel—were only able to weld 175 steel bars per shift in the past. In late March, after the water diversion tunnel work area held a technical demonstration of the Soviet "high-current short-arc welding method," the efficiency of welding steel bars per shift generally increased to more than 270 bars, and the welding quality was also very good.

    狮子滩水电站
    推广施工的先进经验
    狮子滩水电站工程局除了决定推广苏联和外区的九种经验以外，还组织了技术力量，将本单位各项工程中不断出现的先进操作法，系统地总结成了四十一种先进经验。
    现在，这些经验基本上为全局职工所掌握，并且显著地提高了施工效率和质量。建设溢洪道主体工程的职工，三月份学习推广了有关开挖、砌石和施工管理等十二种重要先进经验，全月有五项工程都突出地提高了工作效率。其中实际完成的土方开挖工程，比月计划提高三倍半；浆砌条石工程比月计划提高一点六倍。
    建设主体工程——引水隧道的电焊工人，过去每班只能焊接一百七十五条钢筋；三月下旬，引水隧道工区举行苏联“大电流短弧焊接法”的技术表演以后，每班焊接钢筋的效率普遍提高到二百七十条以上，焊接的质量也很好。　（据新华社讯）
