Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau has summarized 157 advanced experiences in construction enterprise management and construction. Among them, fourteen key advanced experiences such as professional work sections, labor wage fund management, dry-hard concrete, and quicklime powder slurry mortar have been decided to be vigorously promoted in all affiliated construction enterprises.

After the Beijing Sixth Construction Engineering Company implemented the dry-hard concrete experience, not only was the construction quality improved, but also more than 40 kilograms of cement could be saved per cubic meter of concrete, saving more than 50,000 bags of cement annually. The General Logistics Department Directly Subordinate Engineering Company of the Chinese People's Liberation Army used the method of cold-drawing steel bars, drawing 801 tons of steel bars, and saved the country more than 11,600 yuan in terms of elongation rate alone. The first work area of the Fourth Construction Engineering Company of the city used 2,600 square meters of bamboo-made standardized floor slabs, saving timber worth more than 17,400 yuan. Three construction engineering companies in Beijing promoted the construction of inner scaffolding, reducing engineering costs. For example, for the dormitory project of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, the runway built with external scaffolding required a total of more than 32 yuan per square meter for scaffolding and scaffolding labor, while inner scaffolding only required more than 4 yuan. At the same time, pre-fabricated external plastering and clear water wall pointing can be carried out together with bricklaying, shortening the construction period.

    北京建筑工程局总结出一百多项经验
    据新华社9日讯　北京市建筑工程局总结出157项先进的建筑企业管理和施工经验。其中专业工段、劳动工资基金管理、干硬性混凝土、生石灰粉浆砂等十四项关键性的先进经验，决定在所属各建筑企业中大力推广。
    北京市第六建筑工程公司推行了干硬性混凝土经验以后，不仅建筑质量提高了，而且每立方公尺混凝土，可以节约水泥四十多公斤，全年能节约五万多袋水泥。中国人民解放军总后勤部直属工程公司用冷拉钢筋的方法，拉了801吨钢筋，只延伸率一项就为国家节约了一万一千六百多元。市第四建筑工程公司第一工区使用了二千六百平方公尺的竹制定型楼板，节约的木材值一万七千四百多元。北京市三个建筑工程公司推行里脚手架施工，降低了工程成本，如中医医院宿舍工程，用外脚手施工搭的跑道，每平方公尺需要脚手架和搭架子用工共折合三十二元多，而里脚手架只要四元多。同时，能使预制外粉刷和清水墙抅缝同砌砖一起进行，缩短工期。
