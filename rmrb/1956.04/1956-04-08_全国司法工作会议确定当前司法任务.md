The Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice recently convened the Third National Judicial Work Conference.

The conference, based on the new situation of the rapid development of the socialist revolution in China, focused on discussing the correct implementation of the state's criminal policy in judicial work under the new situation. The conference demanded that people's courts at all levels must fully recognize the new situation of the unprecedented rise in the socialist consciousness and enthusiasm of the people across the country, and the fact that many counter-revolutionaries are embarking on the path of confessing and repenting. They should further implement the state's established policy of "combining suppression with leniency" towards counter-revolutionaries. For all counter-revolutionaries who are willing to reform, no matter how great their past crimes were, as long as they genuinely confess, surrender, and sincerely repent today, they should be treated leniently in accordance with the law and given the opportunity to reform. For those counter-revolutionaries who have committed serious crimes and refuse to reform, resolutely oppose the people, and continue to carry out sabotage activities, they must be severely punished in accordance with the law and must not be tolerated.

The conference determined the current tasks of the people's judicial organs, which are to strictly abide by the state's policies and laws, to thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, to further consolidate the revolutionary legal system, and to ensure the smoother and faster development of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

The conference also discussed the judicial work plan for 1956 to 1967, and studied the issue of further strengthening and developing the professional construction of judicial departments.

The conference required judicial organs at all levels to further overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all staff, conscientiously tap the potential in their work, and promote various advanced experiences, so as to greatly advance the people's judicial work and adapt to the needs of the current rapid development of the revolutionary situation.

During the conference, Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai received all the attendees. Peng 真, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Chen 毅, Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the meeting and gave important instructions. Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, made an important report, giving great encouragement and enlightenment to the participants.

    会议确定了当前人民司法机关的任务，就是要严格遵照国家的政策法律，为彻底肃清一切反革命分子，进一步巩固革命法制，保障社会主义建设和社会主义改造的更为顺利迅速的发展而斗争。
    会议还讨论了1956年至1967年的司法工作规划，研究了进一步加强和开展司法部门的业务建设的问题。
    会议要求各地司法机关进一步克服右倾保守思想，发挥全体工作人员的积极性和创造性，认真发掘工作中的潜力，推广各项先进经验，使人民司法工作大步前进，以适应当前革命形势飞速发展的需要。
    会议期间，毛泽东主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理接见了全体出席人员。全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长彭真、国务院副总理陈毅到会作了重要指示，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞作了重要报告，给参加会议的人员以极大的鼓舞和启示。
