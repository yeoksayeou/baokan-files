Do Not Force Transport Vehicles to Join Cooperatives

In Hebei Province, some district and township staff are using methods such as revoking driver's licenses, material purchase permits, and prohibiting large vehicles from leaving villages to force professional transport vehicles to join cooperatives. According to statistics, Handan Prefecture originally had more than 2,900 professional transport carts, but now only 1,300 remain. In some counties in this prefecture, all professional transport carts have been transferred to agricultural cooperatives.

As a result, urban and rural transportation has become a major problem. Recently, a large amount of seeds and urgently needed agricultural production materials have piled up at some railway stations along the railway lines in Hebei Province, unable to be transported to rural areas and agricultural production cooperatives in a timely manner. At Yangcun Station on the Beijing-Tianjin railway line, more than 20,000 tons of building materials are piled up, also unable to be transported to construction sites in a timely manner.

The issue of forcing professional transport vehicles to join cooperatives is not limited to Hebei Province; it exists in other provinces as well. In regions where such incidents have occurred, local leading authorities should educate cadres to change this practice, so as not to affect urban-rural exchange and hinder production.

    不要强迫运输车辆入社
    河北省有些区、乡工作人员采用收回行车执照、购料证、禁止大车出村等办法，强迫专业运输车辆入社。据统计，邯郸专区原有专业运输马车二千九百多辆，现在只剩下一千三百辆了。这个专区有些县的专业运输马车已经全部转农业社了。
    这样一来，城乡运输就大成问题了。河北省境内铁路线上的一些车站，近来堆积了大量的种子和当前迫切需要的农业生产资料，不能及时运到农村和农业生产合作社。京津铁路线上杨村车站堆放两万多吨建筑材料，也不能及时运到建设工地。
    强迫专业运输车辆入社的事情，不仅在河北省有，别的省也有。凡是发生了这种事情的地区，当地领导机关应教育干部改变这种做法，以免影响城乡交流，防碍生产。
