    Automobile Factory Intensifies Production Adjustment
    Over 60% of Automobile Parts Produced
    The work of adjusting production at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is progressing rapidly. Currently, thirteen basic production workshops and the wire drawing workshop are all intensively adjusting production, and over 60% of the automobile parts for the entire factory have already been trial-manufactured. The casting workshop, which started construction the latest, also trial-produced more than twenty kinds of gray cast iron three months ahead of schedule. On April 20th, it will produce molten iron for malleable cast iron and trial-manufacture malleable cast iron. Most of the parts in the chassis workshop have been adjusted, and continuous feeding is underway, soon to produce three hundred sets of parts for the chassis assembly. The general assembly workshop is using complete sets of automobile parts supplied by the Soviet Union to trial-assemble some qualified automobiles. (Our correspondent in Changchun)

    汽车厂加紧调整生产
    汽车零件制出60％以上
    第一汽车制造厂调整生产的工作进展很快。现在，十三个基本生产车间和拔丝车间都在紧张地调整生产，全厂60％以上的汽车零件已经试制出来。施工最晚的铸工车间也提前三个月试制二十多种灰口铸铁，四月二十日要生产可锻铸铁的铁水，试制可锻铸铁。底盘车间绝大部分零件都调整过了，正在连续投料，就要生产三百套底盘总成的零件。总装配车间利用苏联供给的成套的汽车零件，试装出一些合格的汽车。（本报驻长春记者）
