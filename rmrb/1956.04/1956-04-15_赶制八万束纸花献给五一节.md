    Rushing to Make 80,000 Bunches of Paper Flowers to Celebrate May Day

    Members of the Beijing No. 1 Flannelette and Silk Paper Flower Production Cooperative are rushing to make 80,000 bunches of hibiscus, daisies, flowering peach, peony and other paper flowers for the capital's May Day parade.

    This year, the paper flowers made by the cooperative members have thick branches and short stems, lush flowers, and bright colors. Because they are made of better quality thin leaf paper, they appear particularly upright and vibrant.

    Since the upsurge of handicraft industry cooperation, the cooperative members have created more than thirty new products, including velvet, silk, satin, and paper flowers of all kinds.

    赶制八万束纸花献给五一节
    北京市第一绒绢纸花生产合作社的社员们，正在赶制八万束芙蓉、雏菊、碧桃、牡丹等纸花，供首都“五一”节游行队伍使用。
    这个社的社员们今年做的纸花枝粗柄短，花朵茂盛，颜色艳丽，因为是采用质量较好的薄叶纸做的，又显得格外挺拔有神。
    从手工业合作化高潮以后，这个社的社员们共创造了三十多种新产品，其中，绒、绢、绸、缎、纸制的花朵，样样都有。
