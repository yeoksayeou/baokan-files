Xinhua News Agency, Dubrovnik: The 78th session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council opened on April 4th in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. Representatives from more than 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States, are attending the meeting. At the start of the meeting, the Council's political, legal, economic, and social committees held separate sessions. The Council's plenary session will be held on April 7th.

At the joint meeting of the Political Committee and the Legal Committee on the 4th, the issue of the universality of the Inter-Parliamentary Union was discussed, namely, the admission of more countries that meet the Union's charter to join the Union. Representatives from France, Poland, and the Soviet Union argued at the meeting that the scope of the Union should be expanded to make it universal. The French representative said that the Union "should bravely embrace universality, as this is conducive to the cause of peace." The British representative suggested postponing the discussion of this issue to a later meeting.

The Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union adopted a decision to admit the People's Republic of China to the Union at its meeting in New Delhi last November. The Executive Committee will submit a report on this decision to the Council's plenary session, and the Council will make the final decision.

    各国议会联盟理事会在南开会
    据新华社讯　杜布罗夫尼克消息：各国议会联盟理事会第七十八次会议四月四日在南斯拉夫的杜布罗夫尼克开幕。出席会议的有英国、法国、苏联、美国、波兰等三十多个国家的代表。会议开始时，理事会的政治、法律、经济、社会各委员会先举行会议。理事会全体会议将在四月七日举行。
    在政治委员会和法律委员会四日的联席会议上，讨论了各国议会联盟的普遍性的问题，也就是接纳更多符合联盟章程的国家参加联盟的问题。法国、波兰和苏联代表在会上主张联盟的范围应予扩大，使它具有普遍性。法国代表说：联盟“应该勇敢地接受普遍性，因为这有利于和平事业”。英国代表建议把这个问题推迟到以后的会议上讨论。
    各国议会联盟执行委员会去年十一月间在新德里举行的会议上通过了接纳中华人民共和国加入联盟的决定。执行委员会将就这个决定向理事会全体会议提出报告，并且由理事会作出最后决定。
