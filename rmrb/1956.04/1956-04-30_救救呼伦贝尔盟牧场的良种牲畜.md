    Save the Fine Breed Livestock of Hulunbuir League Pastures
    By Our Correspondent Lin Mo
    The Hulunbuir League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has eleven state-owned pastures (including thirty-four sub-farms), with a total of 27,134 head of livestock of various kinds, including 17,034 cattle, 4,038 horses, 5,355 sheep, and 257 camels.
    Over 95% of the cattle in the pastures are fine breed "Sanhe cattle". A good Sanhe dairy cow, if properly raised, can produce forty to fifty catties of milk a day. Over 80% of the horses in the pastures are fine breed "Sanhe horses". These horses are shapely, strong, fast, and can pull a lot. According to investigations by relevant departments, there are currently only over 100,000 fine breed dairy cows and even fewer fine breed horses in the country. The task of the state-owned pastures is to raise and breed these fine breed livestock well for improving our country's livestock breeds.
    However, due to poor feeding and management, a large number of livestock have died in the state-owned pastures of Hulunbuir League. In the ten months from January to October last year, 2,334 livestock died in the eleven pastures (including 1,573 young livestock), accounting for more than 8% of all livestock. 95% of the dead livestock were fine breed cattle and horses. The death of livestock has not been stopped. According to the statistics of eleven sub-farms, another 304 cattle of all sizes died in January of this year, accounting for 4.1% of all livestock in the eleven sub-farms. In February, another 397 head died. The most deaths were of calves. In January and February, 432 calves were born in five pastures, including Labudalin, Haoentao Hai, Bakexi Aobao, Cuogang, and Teni River, and 198 of them died. The mortality rate of young livestock is over 45%, which is rare among local herdsmen.
    The main reasons for the large-scale death of livestock are improper feeding and management, and poor sanitation and disease prevention. The labor discipline and technical operating procedures of the pastures cannot be implemented, and some production managers do not cherish state property. In Labudalin Pasture, where livestock deaths were the most severe, the leaders did not adopt the workers' rationalization proposals, and sixty-eight cattle were drowned in a mud pit during a rainstorm. This farm built more and better offices, but the calf sheds were few and poor, dark, damp, and drafty. Last winter, the livestock sheds of this farm had no one on duty at night for a long time. After the calves were born, the watchman simply dragged them to the pen and considered it done, without wiping their fur or disinfecting their umbilical cords. How could the calves not get sick and die? In many pastures, the livestock did not gain good fat during the green grass season last year. There was insufficient grass feed in winter, and the livestock were weak. In many places, environmental sanitation was very poor, with manure surrounding the cattle sheds and dead livestock carcasses thrown everywhere. In some pastures, dead cattle carcasses could be seen everywhere in the cattle exercise and grazing areas, and in front of the sick cattle isolation rooms. What sanitation and disease prevention are they talking about? In Labudalin Pasture, the cattle sheds were not cleaned in time, and no bedding was provided. The cattle lay in manure and mud, and some had their bellies frozen and tails damaged. In some cases, feces were frozen in piles outside the anus, preventing them from continuing to defecate.
    Some people attribute the death of livestock to the lack of pasture equipment and manpower. This is very unfair. Haoentao Hai General Farm has relatively good equipment and sufficient manpower, but the mortality rate of calves in this farm was as high as 61% in January and February.
    Facts have proved that as long as the leadership mobilizes all forces to protect livestock, the death of livestock can be completely prevented. The youth calf raising group of Mian Du River Sub-farm had no calf deaths in the first quarter. The leaders of Mo Guai Sub-farm believed that three old and thin cows were hopeless and prepared to eliminate them, but the workers saved them. Under the call to rescue the weak and stop death, the employees of Mian Du River Sub-farm challenged each other to ensure that the livestock sheds were dry and that the cattle did not get stained with manure. In order to prevent some weak livestock from getting cold at night, the workers of Mo Guai Sub-farm covered the cattle with broken leather jackets. In Labudalin Pasture, whenever the leaders paid attention to the death of livestock and mobilized the employees to find solutions in all aspects, the death of livestock decreased significantly. However, when the situation improved slightly, the leaders relaxed again. With the loosening and tightening of the work, a periodic death phenomenon of livestock appeared in this farm.
    Recently, the Agricultural and Pastoral Department of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, the Agricultural and Pastoral Department of the government, and the party and government leading organs of Hulunbuir League have successively sent working groups to go deep into the state-owned pastures to help with the work. Some pastures have already begun to take emergency measures, and the employees have taken action. In some places, the death of livestock has been reduced. However, it is hoped that this work will not be relaxed midway, and the death of livestock must be completely stopped; at the same time, the accidents of livestock deaths in various farms should be used to draw lessons, conscientiously check responsibilities, and conduct a thorough rectification of the work of the state-owned pastures.
    The national livestock leadership organs and other relevant parties also need to consider that, in order to truly run these state-owned pastures well, they must be supported and helped with manpower and technology. Most of the eleven state-owned pastures in Hulunbuir League were hastily established last year due to objective needs and without prior preparation. Since the establishment of the farms, the Inner Mongolia Party and government leaders have made considerable efforts to allocate production managers, political workers, and technical personnel from all aspects. However, at present, the quantity and quality of personnel in these state-owned pastures are far from meeting the needs of the work. The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture promised to allocate twenty-two staff members to the state-owned pastures in Inner Mongolia last year, but none have been transferred to date. According to the report of the Hulunbuir League State-owned Pasture Administration Bureau, 42% of the production management personnel, political workers, and various technical personnel are still lacking according to the streamlined establishment of each pasture. At present, a mechanized farm, two mechanized pastures, and a tractor station in this area urgently need to allocate production management personnel and technical guidance personnel. This year, these units will reclaim more than 25,000 hectares of wasteland and sow more than 6,000 hectares of feed. Tractors and hundreds of drivers have been roughly prepared, but three-quarters of the production management personnel and technical guidance personnel are still lacking. And if wasteland cannot be successfully reclaimed and sown this spring, it will inevitably affect this year's and even next year's feed reserves.
    Hulunbuir League, a region that has concentrated on running so many pastures, raising tens of thousands of fine breed livestock, and cultivating more than 30,000 hectares of feed base, we should concentrate all our forces to run it well!

    救救呼伦贝尔盟牧场的良种牲畜
    本报记者  林沫
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟有十一个国营牧场（包括三十四个分场），共有各种牲畜27，134头，其中有牛17，034头，马4，038匹，羊5，355只，骆驼257峰。
    牧场里的牛，95％以上都是优良品种的“三河牛”。一头好的三河种乳牛，如果饲养得法，一天可以产四、五十斤奶。牧场里的马，80％以上是优良品种的“三河马”。这种马，体型优美，体质强健，跑的快，拉的多。据有关部门调查，目前全国的良种乳牛不过十多万头，良种马则为数更少。国营牧场的任务，就是要把这些良种牲畜好好饲养繁殖，用来改良我国的牲畜品种。
    但是呼伦贝尔盟的国营牧场，由于饲养管理不善，造成牲畜的大批死亡。在去年一月到十月的十个月中，十一个牧场死亡牲畜2，334头（其中仔畜1，573头），占全部牲畜的8％以上。死亡的牲畜，95％都是良种牛、马。牲畜的死亡一直未能制止。根据十一个分场的统计，今年一月份又死了大小牛304头，占十一个分场全部牲畜的4.1％。二月份又死了397头。死亡最多的是犊牛。一、二月份，在拉布大林、浩恩陶海、巴克西敖包、嵯岗、特尼河等五处牧场，共产牛犊432头，即死亡198头。幼畜死亡率达45％以上，这在当地一般牧民中都是少有的。
    牲畜大批死亡的原因，主要是饲养管理不当，卫生防疫工作做的不好。牧场的劳动纪律和技术操作规程不能贯彻执行，某些生产管理人员不爱护国家财产。在牲畜死亡最严重的拉布大林牧场，领导人员不采纳工人的合理化建议，在一次风雨中，就有六十八头牛被污死在泥潭里。这个场把办公室盖的又多又好；但是犊牛舍盖的又少又坏，里边阴暗潮湿，到处透风。去年冬天这个场的畜舍长时间没有值夜的人，牛犊生下后，由更夫拉到圈里便算完事，既不擦干毛皮，也不进行脐带消毒。这样，牛犊怎能不病不死呢？在不少牧场里，去年青草季节牲畜没有长好膘。冬季草料不足，牲畜瘦弱。而在许多地方，环境卫生又十分恶劣，粪便包围着牛舍，死畜尸体到处乱扔。有些牧场，在牛的运动、放牧场所和病牛隔离室门前到处都可看到死牛尸体。这还谈得上什么卫生防疫呢？在拉布大林牧场，牛舍里不及时清扫，又不给铺褥草，牛卧在粪尿泥里，有的肚皮冻烂、尾巴也给冻坏了。有的粪便成堆冻结在肛门外，以致不能继续排粪。
    有的人把牲畜死亡归之于牧场设备和人力的不足。这是很不公正的。浩恩陶海总场的设备是比较好的，人力也比较充实，但是在一、二月份这个场牛犊的死亡率高达61％。
    事实证明，只要领导上发动一切力量保护牲畜，牲畜的死亡是完全可以制止的。免渡河分场的青年犊牛饲养组在第一季度犊牛无一死亡。莫拐分场有三头老瘦牛，领导人员认为抢救无望，准备淘汰，但是工人把它们救活了。在抢救瘦弱、制止死亡的号召下，免渡河分场的职工互相挑战，保证畜舍干燥，牛不沾粪便。莫拐分场的工人为使一部分瘦弱牲畜夜间不受寒冷，就用破皮衣盖在牛身上。在拉布大林牧场，每当领导人员重视牧畜的死亡，发动职工从各方面想办法的时候，牲畜的死亡就显著减少。但是当情况稍见好转之后，领导人员就又松懈了。随着工作的一松一紧，这个场就出现了牲畜周期性死亡现象。
    最近，中共内蒙古党委农牧部、政府农牧厅及呼伦贝尔盟的党、政领导机关，已经先后派出工作组，深入到各国营牧场帮助工作。有些牧场已经开始采取紧急措施，职工已经行动起来。有的地方，牲畜死亡已经有所减少。但是希望不要使这项工作中途松劲，一定要完全制止牲畜的死亡；同时，还要通过各场牲畜死亡的事故，吸取经验教训，认真检查责任，对国营牧场的工作，进行一次彻底的整顿。
    国家畜牧业领导机关和其他有关方面也须要考虑到，要真正把这些国营牧场办好，必须从人力和技术上加以支援和帮助。呼伦贝尔盟的十一个国营牧场绝大部分是由于客观的需要，在事前无准备的情况下在去年一年中仓促办起来的。建场以来，内蒙古党、政领导方面曾作了相当的努力，从各方面调配了生产管理人员、政治工作人员和技术人员。但是目前在这些国营牧场里，人员的数量和质量都远赶不上工作的需要。农业部畜牧兽医总局在去年答应调配给内蒙古各国营牧场二十二个工作人员，可是到现在一个也没有调去。根据呼伦贝尔盟国营牧场管理局的报告，按各牧场紧缩后的编制机构，生产管理人员、政治工作人员和各种技术人员尚缺42％。目前在这个地区的一个机耕农场、二个机耕牧场、一个拖拉机站迫切需要调配生产管理人员和技术指导人员。今年，这些单位要开荒地二万五千多公顷，播种饲料六千多公顷。现在拖拉机和数百名驾驶员已经大致准备好了，但是生产管理人员和技术指导人员还缺四分之三没有着落。而如果今春不能顺利开荒播种，势必影响到今年甚至明年的饲料储备。
    呼伦贝尔盟一个地区，集中办这么多的牧场，饲养数万头良种牲畜，耕种三万多公顷饲料基地，我们应该集中各方面的力量，把它办好！
