    On the Poems of Young Author Zhang Yongmei
    Yuan Shuipai
    Zhang Yongmei is one of the noteworthy young poets who have emerged in recent years. His collections of poems include "New Spring" and "Poems by the Sea" (Hubei People's Publishing House). Judging from these works, the author's talent is significant. Some individual works have been set to music and have won awards in local literary and artistic performances.
    His poems mostly focus on military life. "New Spring" depicts the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and "Poems by the Sea" depicts the life of the coastal defense forces. The author joined the army in 1949 and is a literary and artistic worker in the military. Six or seven years is not a short time, especially for a young person. The combat life of the military undoubtedly has a great impact on the author's creation. Living and fighting together with the soldiers, and being close to the people, enables him to be familiar with the lives of soldiers and revolutionary masses, to better understand their inner world, and to be able to write quite realistically about the spiritual outlook of soldiers and revolutionary masses; so that the thoughts and feelings he expresses are consistent with their thoughts and feelings. The characters in some narrative poems and lyric poems, and the image of the lyrical protagonist, can be said to have a certain typical significance. These poems express the advanced revolutionary thoughts and feelings of the people, and have the power to move and inspire people; and are also quite beautiful artistically.
    The images of the volunteer soldiers in the short narrative poems "The Young Medic," "Under the Eaves," and "Spring Morning," and the images of the People's Liberation Army soldiers in the lyric poems "Riding a Horse and Carrying a Gun Around the World," "'Five-Eye Well' Water," and "Homecoming Song," are all relatively well-written. They prominently express their spirit of loyalty to the motherland, love of peace, love of the people, as well as courage and optimism. These character images give people a feeling of authenticity and credibility. The images of other positive characters besides soldiers are also relatively vivid in some works.
    In some lyric poems written in the first person, it is simply impossible to tell whether the author is writing about a soldier or about himself.
    The protagonist in "Homecoming Song" ("Liberation Army Literature and Art," April 1955 issue) is "I." However, this "I" also represents many, many soldiers. This soldier was a poor young farmer in the past, and left home for six years after joining the army. When he returned to his hometown to visit relatives, he saw that tremendous changes had taken place in his hometown. The face of the new society, the development of the country's construction cause, and the progress of his relatives and friends in the past few years aroused the patriotic feelings of the character in the poem – "I" – even more. This emotion also infected the readers.
    The poem begins by writing about the soldier's sights and sounds on the way back to his hometown, with detailed descriptions. These descriptions are combined with lyrical expressions of recalling the suffering of the past, and meticulously carve out the character's personality and psychology: How he held the river water of his hometown in his hands and "swallowed it drop by drop," how he remembered being exploited by the landlord for boat money when crossing the river in the past, and now seeing that a stone bridge had been built over the river, he was so happy that he "walked a little, stood for a while, touching and looking at each stone"... There is also a vivid description of the soldier's excited state of mind as he is about to reach the door of his home:
    Walking and walking, my heart is pounding,
    My home is just around the corner!
    Whisper: I'm back!
    Try to see how much my accent has changed!
    The local accent hasn't changed, but the person may have,
    Tighten the belt and straighten the military cap,
    Wipe the medal and smile:
    This is the peasant of six years ago!
    The ending of the poem describes the soldier and his relatives and friends thanking the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for leading the people to achieve revolutionary victory. A few concise lines, but it is impossible not to be moved when reading here.
    The story tells about the lamp on the palm,
    Thank Chairman Mao for teaching us to grow up!
    Same face, same voice,
    People are no longer the people they used to be...
    The theme is often easily expressed in a conceptual way in generally bad poems, but there is no such shortcoming here. One only feels that these words are closely combined with the many other descriptions of characters, environment, and atmosphere. The theme is not nakedly and stiffly attached here, but naturally revealed through artistic images.
    Of course, it cannot be said that the author has fully grasped this aspect (or other aspects). It should be said that our poet is not yet mature. The artistic level is not balanced in his dozens of works. In some chapters, the author is precisely not very successful in this aspect. For example, "Mountain Song at Dusk by the Sea." Most of the poem describes the labor life of fishermen and salt workers, which is written very vividly and beautifully, but the social characteristics of their labor cannot be fully and significantly seen from these descriptions. Therefore, the author's statement in the last section of the poem that
   "Fishermen and salt workers are all happily" "walking the happy road of socialism" feels a bit stiff and has not yet been fully integrated with the previous description. Even in the poem "Homecoming Song," the section at the end about the soldier's determination to return to the border to defend the country still has traces of roughness in its art.
    The argumentative endings in some of the author's poems (such as the soldier's oath to defend the country) have not been able to combine with the previous parts into a harmonious whole, making the work loose and not subtle enough. Some words that appear to be strong on the surface do not make the ending more powerful. But in other poems, the advantages of a more refined structure are shown, for example, "Under the Eaves." The content describes the volunteer soldiers camping outside the door of a Korean old people’s house at night. The next morning, the host discovered them and kindly blamed them for being too "distant". The length is quite economical, and the development of the plot is compact. The last section fully reveals the theme, but there are no redundant words.
    The elder sister-in-law's tears welled up,
    It took her a while to say:
    "Korean houses are your homes,
    Why live under the eaves in such heavy wind and snow?..."
    Economy and refinement are certainly not simplicity and roughness. Take the poem above as an example. The author describes how the soldiers camped, how they were buried in the snowdrift, how the Korean women swept the snow, and how the soldiers were discovered, which is quite detailed and vivid:
    Ah! The snowdrift rustled,
    And collapsed all at once,
    A piece of tarpaulin was suddenly lifted,
    Revealing three volunteer soldiers!
    The volunteer soldiers stood up immediately,
    Steam rising from their bodies,
    They tightened their belts,
    And saluted the elder sister-in-law.
These detailed descriptions of the environment and characters' behavior are concrete and perceptual, creating a feeling of being there. "Steam rising from their bodies" vividly suggests the climatic conditions and the experience of spending the night. Tightening the belt and saluting also generally express the politeness and military discipline of the volunteer soldiers – the spiritual qualities of the characters.
    The author also has noteworthy achievements in the use of national forms. In some of the author's earlier poems, this use sometimes appeared to be relatively rigid, while in some later works, it appeared to be quite fluent. The rhythm of folk songs (or basically the rhythm of folk songs) gives certain works a kind of intimacy, a mass style, and the beauty of poetry. "Homecoming Song" is one example, and "Mountain Song at Dusk by the Sea" also has this advantage:
    Golden beach, the fish eagle is calling:
    The people going out to sea are back!
    With a victorious smile,
    Carrying fish baskets, carrying poles,
    Thousands of big fish and small fish,
    Bouncing, white and glistening.
    Hey, hey, hey,
    The sunset glow in the evening by the sea is magnificent,
    The evening by the sea is bustling and lively,
    The people going out to sea are back!
The following paragraph describes the labor of the salt workers. The rhythm is the same, with lines such as "Salt grains piled high like snow mountains, sparkling, white and bright," the rhythm and rhyme are beautiful.
    Of course, the author still needs to improve in terms of both thought and art. After all, there are relatively few works with profound thoughts, and the art still appears to be rough, with lengthy and redundant sentences and paragraphs. These two collections are only the author's preliminary gains. However, what is very gratifying is that these works significantly reveal the poetic talent of this young man.

    谈青年作者张永枚的诗
    袁水拍
    张永枚是近年来出现的值得注意的青年诗人之一。他的诗集有“新春”和“海边的诗”两本（湖北人民出版社）。从这些作品看来，作者的才能是显著的。有个别作品曾经配了曲，在地方举办的文艺会演中得了奖。
    他的诗大都以部队生活为题材。“新春”写抗美援朝的斗争，“海边的诗”写海防部队的生活。作者于1949年参军，是军队中的文艺工作者。六、七年的时间不算短，尤其对于一个青年来说。部队战斗生活对于作者的创作，无疑是有很大影响的。和战士们生活、战斗在一起，也和人民群众接近，使他能够熟悉战士和革命群众的生活，比较理解他们的内心世界，使他能够相当真实地写出战士和革命群众的精神面貌；使他所抒发的思想感情能够和他们的思想感情一致。某一些叙事诗、抒情诗中的人物形象和抒情的主人公的形象，可以说是具有一定的典型意义的。这些诗表现了人民的先进的革命的思想感情，有感动人鼓舞人的力量；艺术上也是相当优美的。
    短篇叙事诗“年轻的卫生兵”、“屋檐下”、“春天的早晨”中的志愿军战士形象，抒情诗“骑马挂枪走天下”、“‘五眼井’水”、“还乡曲”中的人民解放军战士的形象，都是描写得比较好的。它们突出地表现了他们忠于祖国、热爱和平、热爱人民的精神品质，以及勇敢和乐观主义的精神。这些人物形象给人以真实可信的感觉。战士以外的其他正面人物的形象，在某些作品中也是比较生动的。
    在一些用第一人称写的抒情诗中，简直分不清作者是在写战士还是在写自己。
    “还乡曲”（“解放军文艺”，1955年4月号）中的主角是“我”。但是，这个“我”又代表着许许多多的战士。这个战士过去是个贫苦的青年农民，参军后离家六年。当他探亲回乡的时候，看到了家乡已经发生巨大的变化。新社会的面貌，国家建设事业的发展，家乡亲友几年来的进步，激起了诗中人物——“我”的爱国主义情绪的更加高涨。这种情绪也感染了读者。
    诗开头写战士回乡一路见闻，有细节的描绘，这些描绘结合着回忆过去苦难生活的抒情，相当细致地刻划了人物的性格、心理：怎样手捧家乡河水“一滴一滴慢慢咽”，怎样想起从前渡河受地主剥削船钱，现在看见河上已架了石桥，高兴得“走一走，站两站，一块块石头摸摸又看看”……对于战士将要到达家门口的兴奋的精神状态，也有生动的描写：
    走着走着心直跳，
    我的家拐弯就来到！
    低声说句：我回来了！
    试一试口音变了多少！
    乡音没改人可变了，
    紧一紧布带正一正军帽，
    擦一擦奖章抿嘴笑：
    这就是六年前的庄稼佬！
    诗的结束部分写到战士和他的亲友们一起感谢共产党和毛主席领导人民取得革命的胜利。简洁的几行，却使人在读到这里的时候，不能不受到感动。
    故事讲到掌上灯，
    感谢毛主席教导我们成人！
    一样的容颜一样的声，
    人们已不是从前的人……
    主题思想在一般不好的诗作中往往容易表现得概念化，在这里却没有这个缺点，只觉得这一些话和其他的许多对人物、环境、气氛的描写，紧密地结合在一起。主题思想在这里不是赤裸裸地生硬地附加上去的，而是通过艺术形象，自然地流露出来的。
    当然，还不能说作者在这一方面（或者其他方面）已经有了充分的把握。应该说，我们的诗人还不是成熟的。艺术水平在他的几十首作品里并不是平衡的。在某些篇章中，作者恰恰在这一方面显得不大成功。例如“海边黄昏的山歌”。诗的大部分描写渔民和盐民的劳动生活，写得很形象，很美，但是从这些描写里并不能充分显著地看出他们的劳动的社会特征来。因此，作者在诗的最后一节里所交代的
  “渔民盐民都欢欢喜喜地”“走着社会主义的幸福大道”的话，就有些生硬的感觉，还没有和前面的描写充分地融合在一起。就在“还乡曲”这一首诗中，末尾所写的战士决心重返边疆捍卫国家一节，在艺术上也还有粗糙的痕迹。
    作者某些诗中的议论性的结尾（例如战士的保卫国家的誓言）没有能够和前面的部分结合成和谐的整体，使作品松弛，不够含蓄。一些表面上看来是强烈的字眼，却并不能使结尾变得更为有力。但是在另一些诗中又表现了结构方面比较精炼的优点，例如“屋檐下”这一首就是这样。内容写志愿军战士夜晚露宿在朝鲜老百姓家门口，早上主人发现以后亲切地责备他们不应该这样“见外”。篇幅相当经济，情节的展开是紧凑的。最后一节充分地揭示了主题思想，却并没有多余的话。
    大嫂的眼泪润湿了眼眶，
    半天才说出了话：
    “朝鲜的房子就是你们的家，
    这大的风雪为啥住在屋檐下？……”
    经济和精炼当然不是简陋粗疏。就拿上面这首诗来说，作者描写战士怎样露宿，怎样被埋在雪堆里，朝鲜妇女怎样扫雪，战士怎样被发现，还是相当细致生动的：
    呀！雪堆沙沙作响，
    一下子垮了下来，
    一块雨布顿时揭开，
    露出三个志愿军战士！
    志愿军立刻站起，
    身上蒸发着水气，
    他们勒了勒皮带，
    向大嫂行了军礼。这些对环境和人物行为的细节描写是具体的，感性的，构成一种仿佛身临其境的感觉。“蒸发着水气”，形象地提示了气候条件和过夜的经历。勒皮带和行军礼，又概括地表现了志愿军的礼貌和军纪——人物的精神品质。
    作者在民族形式的采用方面，也有值得注意的成绩。在作者的较早的一些诗中，这种采用有时显得比较呆板，而在后来的一些作品中，就显得相当流利了。民歌的节奏（或者基本上是民歌的节奏）使某些作品具有亲切的韵味，群众化的风格，诗的美感。“还乡曲”就是一个例子，“海边黄昏的山歌”也有这个优点：
    黄金的沙滩渔鹰在叫：
    出海的人们回来了！
    带着胜利的微笑，
    抬着渔篓挑着挑，
    大鱼小鱼千万条，
    直蹦跳，白漂漂。
    哎哎哎哎，
    海边的黄昏霞光万道，
    海边的黄昏热热闹闹，
    出海的人们回来了！接着的一段写盐民的劳动，节奏是相同的，有“盐粒堆得雪山高，亮晶晶，白皎皎”等句，节奏和韵律都是优美的。
    当然，作者无论在思想方面艺术方面，还有待于提高和改进，思想深刻的作品毕竟较少，艺术上也还显得粗糙，有冗长多余的句子和段落。目前这两本集子只是作者的初步的收获。但是，十分可喜的是这些作品显著地透露了这位青年的诗的才能。
