Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 19th: President Wilhelm Pieck of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on April 17th, advocating that the two Germanys reach an understanding on limiting and supervising the armed forces of both countries, as an effective first step towards seeking German reunification. President Pieck called on all Germans, all responsible men and women in the parliaments and governments of the two Germanys, and West German President Lübke, to do everything possible to promote an international understanding on disarmament to help Germany's unification and to prevent anything that hinders the achievement of such understanding.

In his statement, Pieck supported the World Peace Council's Special Meeting's call for disarmament, pointing out that every step forward in disarmament would promote a peaceful solution to the German question.

Pieck pointed out that the Bonn government's decision to rearm and join the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization is deepening the division of Germany. The German people must take another path.

The statement said that peace-loving people all over the world are filled with hope by the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals. The statement said: If a region including the two parts of Germany and the territories of its neighboring countries is established in Europe to limit and supervise armaments, it will undoubtedly greatly contribute to the solution of the entire disarmament problem. The German people themselves are very interested in stipulating the maximum limit of troops stationed in this region by the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France. For the sake of our own security, our people are also required to advocate that no atomic weapons be stored and no special forces equipped with such weapons be stationed in this region within this arms limitation region. These contracting states, including the two Germanys, should jointly supervise the observance of arms limitation obligations in this region.

Pieck said that the German people must do their utmost to promote an understanding between the major powers on the issue of disarmament. The Germans themselves should negotiate.

    德意志民主共和国总统皮克发表声明
    号召两个德国协商裁军问题谋求国家重新统一
    新华社柏林19日电　德意志民主共和国总统皮克在四月十七日发表声明，主张由两个德国就限制和监督两国武装力量达成谅解，作为谋求德国重新统一的一个首先的有效步骤。皮克总统号召一切德国人、两个德国的议会和政府中所有具有责任感的男女以及西德总统豪斯要尽一切力量促进就裁军问题达成国际谅解以有助于德国的统一，阻止妨碍达成谅解的事情。
    皮克在他的声明里支持世界和平理事会特别会议关于裁军的号召，指出在裁军方面的每一步进展，将会促进德国问题的和平解决。
    皮克指出，波恩政府重新武装和加入侵略性的北大西洋公约的决定，加深着德国的分裂。德国人民必须走另一条道路。
    声明说，全世界爱好和平的人民对苏联裁军新建议充满着希望。声明说：如果在欧洲建立一个包括德国两部分及其邻国领土在内的对军备加以限制和监督的地区，无疑将十分有助于整个裁军问题的解决。德国人民本身在很大程度上对于规定美、苏、英、法四国在这个地区驻军的最高限额这件事感到兴趣。为了我们本身安全的利益，也要求我们人民主张在这个限制军备的地区内不储存原子武器和驻扎配备这种武器的特种部队。包括两个德国在内的这些缔约国家应当共同监督这个地区对军备限制义务的遵守。
    皮克说，德国人民要全力促进大国间就裁军问题求得谅解。德国人自己应该进行谈判。
