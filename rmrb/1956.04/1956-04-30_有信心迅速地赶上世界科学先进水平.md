With confidence, we will quickly catch up with the world's advanced scientific level
By Su Buqing, Member of the Department of Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

Since the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the call to rapidly catch up with the world's advanced scientific level, the people of the whole country, especially scientists, are enthusiastically responding to this call and are contributing all their strength to complete such a glorious and arduous task. The Soviet experience tells us that socialist construction depends on science and technology, and the development of science and technology can only achieve unprecedented speed under the task of socialist construction. From the perspective of mathematics, the science I study, we can also appreciate this point.

As everyone knows, China's mathematics, like other natural sciences, is still in a relatively backward position in the world. Before liberation, I worked in the Department of Mathematics at Zhejiang University for more than 20 years, and the number of mathematical talents I cultivated was not as many as the number of graduates from a comprehensive university's mathematics department each year now. Now, the number of mathematical talents has greatly increased, and the quality has also improved significantly. For example, the "Acta Mathematica Sinica" compiled by the Chinese Mathematical Society published more than 200 pages of papers each year in the 1930s, which was an extremely difficult task. But now, we have many manuscripts and can often get them published, and the quality of the papers has also improved. Today, the research conditions for scientists are significantly different. In the past, many scientists completed the writing of a paper under such difficult conditions. At that time, there was a lack of data, no research assistants, and no encouragement and support. Now, thanks to the full support of the Party and the government, good conditions have been created for science to catch up with the world's advanced level. Some of the wishes we had dreamed of but did not achieve in the past, such as library equipment, research institutions, and research assistants, have been realized.

In the short six years after liberation, science has been able to develop rapidly, on the one hand, due to the needs of the country's socialist construction, and on the other hand, it is also inseparable from the Party's policy towards senior intellectuals. The Party has correctly grasped the fact that the vast majority of China's scientific workers love the motherland, and educated and united us scholars from the old society, asking us to give full play to our potential and serve the people with all our scientific knowledge. The young people we have trained have improved their political awareness, are very humble in seeking advice, are willing to actively learn professional skills, work hard and endure hardship, and are not afraid of any difficulties in carrying out research work. This is the new force driving the development of science in our country, and it is also a source of encouragement for older scientists to teach enthusiastically. Taking the differential geometry research group of the Department of Mathematics at Fudan University, which I supervise, as an example, a total of ten people participated in this research group in the past year, and each wrote a paper. Among them, three people wrote four papers each, and the quality of two or three of them has reached the international level. This fact was not only impossible in the past, but also unimaginable. Some young mathematical workers in our research group, because of studying some Soviet works, such as the theory of affine connection space, the theory of exterior forms, etc., have mastered the basic methods that Chinese people almost spent ten years to understand and apply - the tools necessary for differential geometry research - in just two years. This shows that it is possible to catch up with the world's advanced level of mathematics in twelve years. Moreover, China's mathematics has currently reached or is close to the international level in several aspects, and we should cherish and promote it even more. Of course, we should not be complacent about some current achievements, thereby neglecting the research of exploratory problems, because these problems are precisely the future of scientific research and development. At the same time, we should not be disappointed because some disciplines are still very weak or even blank. Today, through international scientific cooperation and international academic exchanges, especially the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we can have full confidence in solving this problem. Science is developing very fast, and today is already the atomic energy era. It is impossible to rely solely on ourselves. "The stones of other mountains" can attack jade, not to mention that the scientific road that others have already taken is both straight and fast. When we master the world's science and technology, it will not be difficult to catch up with the world level.

Recently, I participated in the national science planning work and felt that the combination of mathematics learned in the past and practice was not enough. Mathematics, because the nature of this science was originally abstracted from objective reality and studied, it is not only not specific in form, but also essentially belongs to exploratory theory. It is difficult to compare mathematical research one by one with reality. However, we cannot only engage in theory and neglect or even forget practice. Before liberation, some mathematicians who admired the United States thought that only algebra and topology were true mathematics, and other departments were not worth developing. This prejudice today will greatly hinder the role of mathematics in socialist construction, thereby affecting the development of mathematics itself. Today, national defense and industrialization require electronic computers, and the completion of this task depends on the efforts of Chinese mathematicians and physicists. However, some mathematical workers, including myself, know too little about this department. To catch up with the world's advanced scientific level in twelve years, in addition to the support of the Party and the government and the help of the Soviet Union, both new and old scientists must give full play to their initiative and creativity and combine theory with practice to make mathematics serve national construction.

On the road to science, we have full confidence. We, the older generation of scientific workers, are willing to bravely and enthusiastically take on the glorious task of leading the younger generation to march towards science!

    有信心迅速地赶上世界科学先进水平
    中国科学院物理学数学化学学部委员  苏步青
    自从党中央和国务院提出迅速地赶上世界的科学先进水平的号召以来，全国人民尤其是科学家正在热烈地响应这号召，要为完成这样光荣而艰巨的任务贡献出一切的力量。苏联的经验告诉我们，社会主义建设有赖于科学技术，而科学技术的发展只有在社会主义建设的任务下才能获得空前的速度。仅从我所研究的数学这门科学的角度来看，也可以体会到这一点。
    大家都知道，我国数学和其他自然科学一样，还是处在世界上较为落后的地位。解放前我在浙江大学数学系工作了二十多年，培养的数学人材的数目，总共抵不到现在一个综合大学数学系每年毕业生的人数。现在，数学人材的数量大大增加，质量也有显著提高。比方说，中国数学会编的“数学学报”，在三十年代每年出版二百多页的论文，那是极其困难的工作。而现在呢，我们的稿件很多，并经常能够得到出版，论文的质量也有所提高。今天科学家的研究条件显著不同了。过去许多科学家是在多么困难的条件下完成一篇论文的写作。那时既缺少资料，又没有研究助手，更得不到鼓励和支持。现在，由于党和政府的全力支持，为科学赶上世界先进水平创造了良好的条件，我们以往所梦想过而没有达到的一些愿望如图书设备、研究机构、研究助手等，都实现了。
    在解放后短短的六年间，科学能够得到迅速的发展，一方面是由于国家的社会主义建设的需要，一方面也是和党对高等知识分子的政策分不开的。党很正确地掌握了我国科学工作者绝大多数热爱祖国这一个事实，教育和团结我们来自旧社会的学者，要我们发挥潜力，把自己的一切科学知识为人民服务。在我们培养下的青年们，政治觉悟提高了，很虚心求教，肯积极学习业务，刻苦耐劳，不怕任何困难进行研究工作。这是推动我国科学发展的新生力量，同时也是鼓励老科学家热心教导的源泉。就我所指导的复旦大学数学系微分几何研究小组来看，过去一年间参加这个研究小组的人员共十人，每人都写了论文，其中有三人每人都写了四篇论文，并且有两三篇的质量已经达到国际水平。这个事实在以往不但是做不到，而且也是不能想像的。在我们这个研究小组里的一部分青年数学工作者，因为学习苏联的一些著作，如关于仿射联络空间论、外形式论等，在短短的二年间就掌握了以往我国人差不多花了十年工夫才能体会运用的基本方法——在微分几何研究中所必需的工具。这就说明，要在十二年内赶上数学的世界先进水平，是有可能实现的。何况我国数学在好几个方面目前已经达到或接近国际水平，我们更要珍惜而加以发扬。当然，我们不应该为了目前一些成就而感到自满，从而疏忽探索性问题的研究，因为这些问题正是科学研究发展的前途。同时，我们也不应该因为目前有些学科还很薄弱甚至是空白而失望。今天，我们通过国际科学的合作和国际学术的交流，尤其是苏联的无私的帮助，完全可以有信心解决这个问题。科学发展得很快，今天已经是在原子能时代了，不可能专靠自己来搞。“他山之石”，可以攻玉，何况走人家已经走过的科学道路，既直又快，等到我们掌握世界的科学技术之后，就会自己来发展。到那时候，赶上世界水平并不是难事了。
    最近我参加国家的科学规划工作，感觉到以往所学的数学与实际的结合太不够了。数学，由于这门科学的性质原来是从客观现实抽象化出来而加以研究的，它不但在形式上没有具体的实际，而且在本质上属于探索性的理论，要把数学研究一一和实际相对照，那是有困难的。但是，我们不能够只搞理论，而把实际疏忽甚至忘却了。在解放前，有一些崇拜美国的数学家，以为只有代数学和拓扑学是真的数学，而其余部门都是不值得发展的东西。这种偏见在今天来说，会大大地阻碍数学在社会主义建设中的作用，从而影响着数学本身的发展。在今天，国防和工业化都需要电子计算机，这项任务的完成有赖于我国数学家和物理学家的努力创造。可是一些数学工作者连我也在内，对于这个部门的知识实在太少了。我们要在十二年内赶上世界科学先进水平，除了党和政府的支持，苏联的帮助而外，新老科学家必须充分发挥积极性和创造性，把理论与实际结合起来，使数学为国家建设服务。
    在向科学进军的道路上，我们有着充分的信心，我们老一代的科学工作者，愿意把带领青年一代向科学进军的光荣任务勇敢地、热情地担当起来！
