Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 9th: The "Red Rights Daily" published the full text of the "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," written by the editorial department of the Chinese "People's Daily," on its second and third pages today.

The newspaper added the following editor's note before the article: "On April 5th, 'People's Daily,' the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, published an editorial entitled 'On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.' This article was written on the basis of discussions at an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It profoundly elaborates the historical conditions for certain errors that arose in the international revolutionary movement after the birth of the first socialist country, particularly in connection with the cult of personality of J.V. Stalin. It will help our readers to fully understand the results of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."
