Planting Trees Requires Ensuring Survival
Deputy Director of the Afforestation Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry, Lü Yun

Over the past six years, China's afforestation area has reached more than 5.7 million hectares. The survival rate of afforestation has also been increasing year by year. According to incomplete statistics, the national average afforestation survival rate in 1953 was 64%, and in 1954 it was 72%. However, this survival rate is still very low. In particular, the afforestation survival rate in some areas is shockingly low. For example, in the autumn of 1954, the direct seeding of Masson pine in northern Sichuan Province and the planting of Chinese fir in Luzhou Prefecture in the spring of 1955 almost completely failed. In other areas, the survival rate of planted Chinese fir rarely exceeded 40%. Why is the quality of afforestation so poor? The main reason is that some staff members regard afforestation work as too simple. Before afforestation, they neither conducted scientific investigations and research on natural conditions and the growth laws of trees, nor did they make preparations in terms of seeds, seedlings, land preparation, and labor. During the afforestation process, the ideological education and organizational work of the masses were done very poorly. After afforestation, the tending and protection of young forests were also generally not well done. In order to accelerate the greening of the motherland, various regions have formulated huge afforestation plans. However, completing the afforestation plan is a long-term and arduous endeavor. It must be recognized that completing the afforestation plan not only requires planting trees but also ensuring that the vast majority of the planted trees become forests. The idea and practice of "only being responsible for planting, not for survival" must be criticized. Making afforestation abundant, fast, and economical must be based on "good" quality. Ensuring the quality of afforestation is precisely to accelerate the speed of greening.

At present and for a considerable period in the future, afforestation work will mainly rely on agricultural producers' cooperatives. Therefore, when formulating afforestation plans for cooperatives, appropriate measures must be stipulated to ensure the comprehensive completion of afforestation quantity and quality. Guangxi Province, based on overall planning, proposed the "three fixings and three arrangements" method, that is, with the cooperative as the unit, fix the afforestation area, fix the technical specifications for afforestation, and fix the work points for various afforestation tasks, while arranging the time, arranging the labor force, and arranging the tree species and order. This practice is worth promoting.

To ensure a high survival rate of planted trees, it is necessary to have qualified tree species and seedlings. Currently, the shortage of tree species and seedlings is a major problem in afforestation. Under these circumstances, some regions use untested wild seedlings for afforestation, which affects the quality of afforestation. Digging up wild seedlings can only solve the source of seedlings needed for small-scale afforestation or replanting. If wild seedlings are commonly used for afforestation, it will not only lead to poor afforestation quality but also cause the phenomenon of so-called "afforestation on one mountain empties two mountains," which damages the original mountain forests. This is very detrimental to the entire greening effort. In order to improve the quality of afforestation as much as possible, the seeds and seedlings used for afforestation (including wild seedlings) should be preliminarily inspected, and seeds that cannot germinate or seedlings that cannot survive should be resolutely eliminated.

To solve the problem of the source of tree species and seedlings, in addition to strengthening the work of state-owned nurseries, the most important method is for agricultural producers' cooperatives to establish small nurseries to cultivate seedlings. Cooperatives in various regions should seize the time to do a good job in seedling cultivation this spring in order to supply a large number of seedlings needed for afforestation this autumn and next spring. In seedling cultivation, as long as leadership is strengthened and the planning of work is strengthened, the supply of seed collection and seedling cultivation can gradually adapt to the needs of afforestation.

In order to improve the afforestation survival rate, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance and promote advanced experiences. Afforestation, like planting crops, should have a series of reasonable technical measures, such as land preparation, planting, tending, and protection. When the Laoshan Forest Farm in Shandong Province carried out afforestation last winter, it included meeting technical requirements as a specific content of the competition, which resulted in doubling work efficiency and ensuring quality. Local forestry departments should systematically help cooperatives refer to the "National Afforestation Technical Regulations," combine them with local original experiences, and formulate technical specifications to ensure afforestation quality as the basis for afforestation technical measures. At the same time, in the future, attention should be paid to summarizing successful afforestation experiences suitable for the specific conditions of various regions, and adopt methods such as organizing visits, technical exchange conferences, and compiling small booklets to promptly promote these advanced experiences. This will be of great help in improving the quality of afforestation.

    栽树要栽活
    林业部造林局副局长　吕韵
    六年来，我国造林面积已经达570多万公顷。造林成活率也在逐年提高。据不完全的统计：1953年全国造林成活率平均是64％，1954年是72％，但是，这个成活率还是很低的。特别是有些地区的造林成活率更是低得惊人。如1954年秋，四川省北部直播的马尾松和1955年春泸州专区插的杉，几乎全部没有成活。其他地区插杉的成活率也很少超过40％。造林质量为什么这样低劣呢？主要原因是有些工作人员把造林工作看得太简单，在造林之前，既没有对自然条件和林木生长规律进行科学的调查研究，也没有在种苗、整地、劳力等方面做好准备；在造林过程中，对群众的思想教育工作和组织工作做得很差；造林之后，对幼林的抚育和保护工作，也普遍没有做好。为了加速绿化祖国，各地已经制定了规模巨大的造林规划。但是要完成造林规划，是一个长期的艰巨的努力过程。必须认识，完成造林规划，不仅是要栽上树，而且要保证栽上的树绝大多数都成林。对于那种“管栽不管活”的思想和做法必须加以批判，造林的又多又快又省，必须建立在“好”的基础上。保证造林质量，正是为了加快绿化的速度。
    在目前和今后一个相当长的时期内，造林工作主要是依靠农业生产合作社去做，因此，在制定合作社的造林计划的时候，必须规定适当的办法，保证造林数量、质量全面完成。广西省在全面规划的基础上，提出“三定三排”的办法，即是以社为单位，定好造林面积，定好造林技术规格，定好造林各项工分，同时排好时间，排好劳力，排好树种、次序。这个做法是值得提倡的。
    要想使栽的树有很高的成活率，必须有合乎规格的树种、树苗。目前造林中，树种、苗木缺乏是个很大的问题。在这种情况下，有的地区把没有经过检验的野生苗木拿来造林，影响了造林的质量。挖取野生苗只能解决小面积造林或补植所需的苗木来源。如果普遍用野生苗造林，不但会使造林质量低劣，而且会造成所谓“一山造林两山空”的破坏原有山林的现象。这对于整个绿化工作是很不利的。为了尽可能提高造林质量，对于用于造林的种子和苗木（包括野生苗木），都要进行初步检验，坚决剔除不能发芽的种子或不能成活的树苗。
    要解决树种、树苗来源问题，除了需要加强国营苗圃工作外，最主要的办法是由农业生产合作社设立小型苗圃，培育树苗。各地合作社应该抓紧时间做好今春的育苗工作，以便大量供应今秋明春造林所需的苗木。在育苗工作中，只要加强领导，加强工作的计划性，就可以使采种、育苗的供应逐步适应造林的需要。
    为了提高造林成活率，必须加强技术指导，推广先进经验。造林和种植农作物一样，应该有一系列合理的技术措施，如整地、栽植、抚育、保护等。山东省崂山林场去年冬天造林的时候，把合乎技术要求一项列为竞赛的具体内容，结果提高了工作效率一倍，也保证了质量。各地林业部门应该有计划地帮助合作社参照“国营造林技术规程”，结合当地原有的经验，订出保证造林质量的技术规格，做为造林的技术措施根据。同时，今后还要注意总结适合各个地区具体条件的成功的造林经验，采用组织参观、技术交流大会，编印小册子等办法，把这些先进经验及时加以推广。这对于提高造林质量会有很大作用。
