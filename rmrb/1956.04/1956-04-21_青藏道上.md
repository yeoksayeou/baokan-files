　　On the Qinghai-Tibet Road
　　By our correspondent Lin Gang
　　The Central Delegation entered Tibet along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. More than two hundred canvas-covered trucks sped across the plateau, raising dozens of miles of yellow dust. At night, we set up camp in tents on the grasslands, resembling a tent city.

　　After crossing Riyue Mountain, we entered the pastoral area. Mountain ranges shielded the vast grasslands. Herds of fat cattle and sheep grazed. At the foot of the mountains were the herdsmen's tents. As the cars passed, Tibetan shepherds ran to the side of the road to look. They wore "Lobas" (sheepskin coats), with one arm exposed.

　　After driving a hundred kilometers along the beautiful shore of Qinghai Lake, we visited the Chaka Salt Lake. Chaka is a Tibetan word meaning salt lake. We drove three kilometers on the salt lake to watch the workers extracting salt. The production process of this naturally crystallized salt is very simple. Workers knock open the salt crust on the surface of the salt lake, scoop out the salt blocks with iron ladles, wash them with water, and pack them into finished products. A worker can extract two to four tons of salt per day. The Chaka Salt Lake has reserves of more than 500 million tons, which, if each person eats ten pounds of salt a year, could supply the country's 600 million people for more than 160 years. Among the salt lakes in Qinghai Province, Chaka Salt Lake ranks only third. The Qaidam Basin has a Charhan Salt Lake with reserves of more than 25 billion tons. The highway from Lhasa to Dunhuang passes through this salt lake, and transportation vehicles travel seventy kilometers on the salt pavement.

　　The grasslands disappeared behind us, and what appeared outside the car window were boundless barren lands and grasslands. Qinghai Province has tens of millions of mu of arable barren land waiting for reclaimers. The first batch of young volunteer reclamation teams composed of outstanding youths from Henan Province has arrived in Qinghai. We visited them on the way. What good lads! Each one was sturdy and full of enthusiasm. They praised Qinghai, vying to tell us about the farm's long-term plans. They said: Come and see us again in a few years, and our lives will be so beautiful! The ground has not yet thawed, and farm tools and livestock are still lacking, but they have already reclaimed 4,860 mu of virgin land in less than a month since arriving here. "The wind can't cool our burning hearts, and the hard ground can't beat our omnipotent hands!" This is the slogan they shouted during land reclamation. The farm secretary told us that this spring, the farm plans to sow 7,000 mu, including wheat and highland barley, as well as vegetables. After autumn, each member can net 900 to 1,300 yuan.

　　Originally, once past Xiangride, we entered the Qaidam Basin. Even the latest maps have shrunk the area of Qaidam. From the time I arrived in Xining, I got a strong impression: the people of Qinghai (of course, this includes people from all over the country participating in the construction of Qinghai) all love to promote the richness of Qaidam. We walked along the southern edge of the basin. What we saw was a desolate Gobi desert, full of sand, rocks, and bushes. But we know that under this basin, which is larger than the British mainland, is an ocean of oil. The people of Qinghai love to boast about Qaidam because they love Qaidam. Here I met two young men from Shanghai. I asked them, "Do you like Qinghai?" One of them replied, "You ask this question because you don't understand Qinghai. Qinghai may disappoint a sightseer, but anyone who truly has a burning desire to build the motherland will never want to leave once he comes here." Both of them studied civil engineering and are participating in basic construction work in the basin.

　　Golmud on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway is a transportation hub. An average of 200 transport vehicles pass through here every day. What is transported to the basin are explorers, drilling rigs, derricks, tents, coal, grain, accordions, radios..., and what is transported to Tibet is mainly grain and daily necessities. Golmud, with a population of 20,000, has only a few rows of mud houses. If you want to find a transportation station, a geodetic survey team, a post office, a trading company, or a Xinhua Bookstore, you have to go to a tent or an "underground house" to find it. More than a thousand tents, of various styles, the most elaborate being the house-shaped tents of the geological department's field teams, and the dome-shaped felt tents of the local Kazakh herdsmen. No passerby would find this "city" simple. Since the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the connection between the interior and Lhasa has become unprecedentedly close, and the exploration and development of the Qaidam Basin has developed so quickly that there is no time to build houses.

　　Climbing up the Kunlun Mountains south of Golmud, we entered the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The plateau mountains are layered, but the undulations are not large. Seen from a distance, they are mountains, but seen up close, they are plains. When the car crossed the Kunlun Pass, it seemed to just cross a ridge, because the altitude of our starting point was already very high. Back then, the road-building troops renamed the Kunlun Mountains "Twelve Step Mountain." We thought this was just a reflection of the soldiers' heroic spirit, but it was actually realistic.

　　The plateau is vast and majestic. Looking at the snow-capped mountains, ice lakes, and green grasslands in the distance, we couldn't help but admire the beauty of our motherland's mountains and rivers. But what attracts us even more is that on this Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has been uninhabited since ancient times, people building socialism have appeared. Only a few years ago, wild cattle, wild horses, and gazelles were the masters here. In 1954, the road-building troops even encountered wild cattle butting the car. Since the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the face of the plateau has been changing every day.

　　From Nachitai to Yangbajing, a full thousand kilometers are traveled on the plateau at an altitude of more than 4,500 meters. Plateau travel is indeed very difficult. The air is thin, the mornings and nights are cold, and there is a lack of water. Anyone coming here for the first time will feel short of breath and breathless with the slightest movement. But plateau life is completely adaptable. We learned to wear long felt boots and walk slowly like the Tibetan people, and we learned to eat only half-full meals on the plateau; we also got used to the minus ten degrees Celsius cold in the tent when we woke up in the morning, and the plateau storms that blew up every day at noon.

　　Going to Lhasa to congratulate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is a glorious and important task entrusted to the delegation by the people of the whole country. Crossing the Chumar River and the Ulusu River, the uppermost reaches of the Yangtze River, and crossing the Tanggula Mountain at an altitude of 5,400 meters, all members of the Central Delegation victoriously arrived in Lhasa on April 17.

    青藏道上
    本报记者  林钢
    中央代表团沿着青藏公路进入西藏。二百多辆篷布汽车飞驶在高原上，数十里黄尘滚滚。夜晚，在草滩上搭起帐篷宿营，俨然是一座帐篷城市。
    翻过日月山，便是牧区。山峦屏障着广漠的草原。一群群肥壮的牛羊在啃草。山脚下是牧民的帐篷。汽车驶过，藏族的牧羊人跑到公路旁边来张望。他们穿着“洛巴”（羊皮袄），把一只胳膊袒露在外面。
    沿着美丽的青海湖岸走了一百公里，我们顺道访问了茶卡盐池。茶卡是藏语，意思就是盐池。我们坐汽车在盐池上驶了三公里去看工人采盐。这天然结晶盐的生产过程非常简单。工人们把盐池表面的盐盖敲开，用铁杓把盐块捞出，用水洗净，包装好，就是成品了。一个工人一天可以采盐二吨到四吨。茶卡盐池的储藏量有五亿多吨，如果一人一年吃十斤盐，可供全国六亿人口吃一百六十多年。在青海省湖盐中，茶卡盐池只居第三位。柴达木盆地有个察尔汗盐湖，储量在二百五十亿吨以上。拉萨到敦煌的公路通过这个盐湖，运输汽车有七十公里是在盐铺的路上走的。
    草原消失在我们身后，出现在车窗外面的是无边无际的荒地和草滩。青海省有数千万亩可耕的荒地等待着开垦者。由河南省优秀青年组成的第一批青年志愿垦荒队已经到达青海。我们路过的时候，曾经去访问他们。多么好的一些小伙子！一个个长得结结实实，情绪饱满。他们向我们夸说青海好，争着告诉我们农庄的远景规划。他们说：过几年你们再来看看，我们的生活该会多美！地还没有解冻，目前农具和牲口都还缺乏，可是他们来到这里不到一个月，就已经开垦了四千八百六十亩生荒地。“风大吹不冷我们火热的心，地硬硬不过我们万能的手！”这是他们在开荒劳动中喊出来的口号。农庄秘书告诉我们说：今年春天，农庄计划播种七千亩，除了小麦和青稞，还要种蔬菜。秋后，每个庄员可净得九百元到一千三百元。
    原来一过香日德，便进入了柴达木盆地。甚至连最新的地图也把柴达木的面积缩小了。从到达西宁的时候起，我得到一个强烈的印象：青海人（自然，这里包括来自全国各地参加青海建设的人）都爱向人宣传柴达木的富饶。我们沿着盆地南部的边沿走。我们看见的是一片荒凉的戈壁滩，满眼沙石和灌木丛。但是我们知道，在这块面积比英国本土还要大得多的盆地底下，是一个石油的海洋。青海人爱夸耀柴达木。是因为他们热爱柴达木，在这里我遇见两个从上海来的青年。我问他们：“你们喜欢青海吗？”其中一个回答说：“你问这句话，是因为你不了解青海。青海也许会使一个游山玩水的旅行家感到失望，但是，谁要真正是怀着一颗建设祖国的热心，他来到这里就再也不想走了。”他们两个都是学土木建筑的，在盆地参加基本建设工作。
    青藏公路上的噶尔穆是交通枢纽。每天平均有二百辆运输汽车通过这里。运到盆地去的是勘探人员，是钻机、井架、帐篷、煤、粮食、手风琴、收音机……，运到西藏去的，主要是粮食和日用品。两万人口的噶尔穆只有几排泥房。你要找运输站、大地测量队、邮局、贸易公司、新华书店，就得到帐篷或“地下房子”去找。一千多具帐篷，式样不一，最考究的是地质部野外工作队的房屋型帐篷，和当地哈萨克牧民的圆顶羊毛毡房。没有一个路过的人会嫌这个“城市”简陋。青藏公路通车以后，内地和拉萨的联系空前密切起来，柴达木盆地的勘察和开发工作发展得又那么快，来不及盖房子。
    噶尔穆往南爬上昆仑山，便进入了青藏高原。高原山峦层叠，起伏却不大。远看是山，近看却是平川。汽车翻过昆仑山口的时候，好像只是翻过一道岭，因为我们起步地点的海拔就很高了。当年筑路部队给昆仑山换了个名字叫“十二步山”，我们以为这只是表现战士们的英雄气概，原来还是写实的。
    高原辽阔雄伟。远望雪山、冰湖和青色的草原，我们都情不自禁地赞赏祖国河山的美丽。但是更吸引我们的是，在这一块亘古以来荒无人烟的青藏高原上，出现了建设社会主义的人。仅仅在几年以前，野牛、野马和黄羊还是这里的主人。1954年筑路部队就曾经碰到过野牛顶住汽车的事情。青藏公路通车以后，高原的面貌每天都在发生变化。
    从纳赤台到羊八井，整整一千公里是在海拔四千五百公尺以上的高原上行路的。高原旅行生活确实非常艰苦。空气稀薄，清晨和夜晚寒冷，缺水。任何人第一次来到这里，都会感到呼吸困难，稍有动作便气喘不已。但是高原生活是完全可以适应的。我们学会了穿着长统毡靴像藏族人民一样缓慢地举步，学会了在高原上每餐只吃半饱；我们也习惯了早晨醒来帐篷内零下十度的寒冷，和每天日中刮起的高原暴风。
    到拉萨去，祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，这是全国人民交托给代表团的光荣而重大的任务。跨过长江最上游的楚玛尔河和乌鲁木苏河，翻越过海拔五千四百公尺的唐古拉山，中央代表团全体人员在四月十七日胜利地到达了拉萨。
