    Afforestation by Airplane Seeding
    Jiang Qing
    March in the South China Sea is a good season for planting trees. On March 4th, a military transport plane spent more than four hours sowing 120 million seeds of Masson pine and Acacia trees over more than 10,000 mu of hills in the Qinba and Duimianpo townships of Wuchuan County, Leizhou Peninsula.
    Just a few days before, an air force unit received a letter from the Guangdong Provincial Forestry Department requesting the dispatch of an airplane to sow tree seeds. The leaders decided to send the best aircraft suitable for sowing. The task was assigned to the flight squadron commanded by Air Force Lieutenant Liu Tonggui. That night, the entire squadron was buzzing with excitement. The task was glorious, but also urgent, and there were many difficulties. The seeds had been mixed with mud, and if they were not sown soon, they would germinate and affect the survival rate. Although this flight squadron had completed complex tasks such as aerial surveying of railway lines, aerial seeding was a first in the country. Liu Tonggui, together with the navigator and pilot, studied how to make the huge transport plane as close to the hilly terrain as possible, so as to sow the seeds well and ensure flight safety. Staff Officer and Air Force Lieutenant Zhou Fengze organized all the flight and communication data, and then led the officers to study this new route. The most difficult thing was installing the seeding device. Under the guidance of the engineering department, it was decided to use the camera hole of the plane to install a specially designed seeding hopper. This was designed by driver Wang Xiaozhong in less than two hours.
    After test flights and test sowings in the airspace above the airport, the plane was flown to its destination by the squadron leader himself.
    Low clouds hung in the sky, and the wind howled. Air Force Lieutenant Liu Tonggui saw the seeding markers: more than a dozen rising plumes of smoke rose from the undulating hills.
    "Prepare!"
    The plane slowly circled, the instrument panel indicating that it was only a little over a hundred meters above the ground.
      "Sow the seeds!" Liu Tonggui pressed the signal bell. The seeding hopper opened, and the seeds sprayed out from under the cabin like plumes of smoke, scattering into long, narrow strips.
    The farmers all over the hills ran and waved to the plane.
    When the plane was flying for the third time, the wind speed suddenly increased to ten meters per second. The air currents also caused the plane to rise and fall. The areas that had not yet been seeded were all disconnected hillsides. Air Force Lieutenant Liu Tonggui thought, "No matter what, every hillside must be covered with green pine trees." He bravely and flexibly used a diving maneuver rarely used by large transport planes, lowering the nose of the plane at an angle. Below the plane, the hillside and the crowd waving red flags seemed to rise rapidly. But when the plane descended to a low altitude of fifty meters, a cloud of smoke-like seeds was precisely scattered on the hillside.
    The farmers, and the students who had come from dozens of miles away, looked up at the sky, ran under the plane, and clapped their hands and cheered. Wang Mingsen, an old farmer in Duimianpo Township in his fifties, said to the forestry worker beside him, "The days of socialism are getting better and better. I just heard that tractors were going to be used to plow the fields, and today I personally saw airplanes sowing seeds!" (With picture)

    用飞机播种造林
    江清
    南海边的三月，正是植树的好季节。三月四日，一架军用运输机，用四个多钟头的时间在雷州半岛吴川县的覃巴乡和对面坡乡一万多亩的丘陵地上，播下了一亿二千多万粒青松和相思树的种子。
    那还是几天前，空军某部接到了广东省林业厅要求派飞机播种树种的信，领导人就决定把适宜播种的最好的飞机派去。任务发给了刘同贵空军中尉指挥的飞行中队。那天晚上，整个中队都沸腾起来。任务是光荣的，但是又是紧急的，困难也不少。树种已经拌上泥，短期内不播，就会发芽，影响成活率。这个飞行中队虽然完成过空中测量铁道线等复杂任务，但是空中播种在全国这还是第一次。刘同贵同领航员、飞行员研究，怎样才能使庞大的运输机尽量接近丘陵地，既要撒好种，又要保证飞行安全。参谋周凤泽空军中尉把一切飞行、通讯资料整理好后，又领着军官们研究这条新的航线。最困难的是安装播种装置，在工程部门的指导下，决定利用飞机的照相孔安装了一个特别设计的播种漏斗。这是车长王孝忠用了不到两个钟头的时间设计出来的。
    经过在机场上空试飞和试播，飞机就由中队长亲自驾驶飞向目的地。
    天空堆着低矮的云层，风呼呼地吹。刘同贵空军中尉看到了播种的标志：起伏的丘陵地上，冒起了十几条冉冉上升的轻烟。
    “准备！”
    飞机徐徐地绕了一个大圈子，仪器表上指示离地面只有一百多公尺。
      “播树种！”刘同贵按动了信号铃。播种漏斗打开，树种像一股股烟雾一样从机舱下喷了出去，散成一条条狭长的带子。
    遍山坡的农民们奔跑着向飞机招手。
    当飞机飞行第三次的时候，风速骤增到每秒钟十公尺。气流也使飞机起伏颠簸。还没有播种的地区都是一片片不相连的山坡。刘同贵空军中尉想：“说什么也要让每一片山坡都长满青松。”他勇敢而灵活地用大型运输机很少采用的俯冲动作，斜着机头往下降。飞机下面，山坡和摇着红旗的人群都好像飞快地升上来。但是当飞机降落到五十公尺的低空的时候，一片烟雾般的种子正好撒落在山坡上。
    农民们，以及从几十里路赶来的学生仰望着天空，跟在飞机下面奔跑，拍掌欢呼。对面坡乡一个五十多岁的老农民王明森对身旁的林业工作人员说：“社会主义的日子，真是越来越好，才听说要用拖拉机翻田耕地，今天就亲眼看见了飞机播树种！”（附图片）
