    A Record of the Clothing Exhibition in the Capital
    Dian Yi
    After the news of the clothing exhibition in the capital was published in the newspapers, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Women's Federation received many letters from the masses. A member of the Baoji City No. 1 Sewing Cooperative wrote twice requesting to come to Beijing to participate in the tailoring work for the exhibition. Eighteen young people from Dalian Institute of Technology jointly wrote to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, saying, "We are young men. Girls and children need beautiful clothes, and we also need to beautify clothing. Please design beautiful clothes for us!" A comrade working at the exhibition said when introducing the exhibition, "Thanks to the active support of the broad masses and the enthusiastic sponsorship of all parties, although our preparation time was less than two months, the content is still relatively rich."
    As soon as we walked into the gate of the exhibition, this comrade's words were immediately confirmed. Here were displayed more than 500 kinds of clothing suitable for different genders, different ages, different occupations, different figures, and different seasons. Ordinary women's clothing is just four types: cheongsam, short tops with long skirts, short tops with long pants, and dresses, but art workers, sewing technicians, and many unnamed clothing makers have designed and made hundreds of styles of clothing based on these four types. The narrator pointed to a spring outfit poetically and said, "Spring has arrived, and girls wearing this pink floral top, paired with a pair of woolen trousers, are much more beautiful than the blooming peach blossoms." Many girls smiled proudly after hearing her words. She added, "When the weather gets warmer, there are many summer clothes here. This snow-white top, with ruffles added to the cuffs, collar, and chest, paired with a sky-blue long skirt, is an ideal summer outfit for young girls." When she introduced the white jumpsuits with red trim for boys and girls to wear in summer, many mothers thought these clothes were both good-looking and convenient, and quickly took out their fountain pens and notebooks to stand beside them and copy.
    Most of the clothing displayed at the exhibition retained the characteristics of national costumes, while also absorbing some of the advantages of foreign clothing, making these clothes more suitable for our labor and life today. Many women feel that although cheongsams look good, they are not very convenient. There were several cheongsams at this exhibition that avoided this shortcoming, with pleats added at the slit, which looked no different from previous cheongsams, but walking was not restricted by the clothes. There were also small, double-breasted short jackets designed for breastfeeding mothers, and short outerwear with wide hems designed for pregnant women, which were both convenient and beautiful. Short jackets and trousers made of seersucker, trimmed with floral cloth, were a type of clothing favored by housewives and female members of agricultural production cooperatives. The materials and workmanship of these clothes were relatively inexpensive, and ordinary women could also tailor them themselves.
    The colors of the clothing on display were also very particular. These blended colors gave people a sense of comfort and pleasure. After a female textile worker visited the exhibition, she wrote in her feedback form: "I am grateful for this exhibition because it inspired me to love life more and made me realize how to correctly handle my own clothing. I must beautify my clothing according to the three principles of economy, aesthetics, and practicality."
    The laboring people create material wealth and also create beauty. They can build their country as beautiful as spring, and they can also dress themselves as beautiful as flowers. Their determination will surely be achieved.

    记首都的服装展览会
    甸义
    当报上披露了首都举办服装展览会的消息以后，团中央和全国妇联收到许多群众来信。宝鸡市第一缝纫社的一个社员两次写信要求来北京参加展览会的裁剪工作。大连工学院十八个青年联名写信给团中央，信中说：“我们是年轻小伙子。姑娘、儿童需要美丽的服装，我们同样也需要美化服装，请给我们设计优美的服装吧！”一位展览会的工作同志在介绍这个展览会时说：“由于广大群众的积极支持和各方面的热烈赞助，我们的筹备时间虽然不到两个月，但是内容还比较丰富。”
    当我们一走进展览会的大门，这位同志的话立刻就被证实了。这里陈列着五百多种适合于不同性别、不同年龄、不同职业、不同身材和不同季节穿的服装。一般的妇女服装就是旗袍、短衣长裙、短衣长裤和衣连裙四种，但是美术工作者们、缝纫技师们和许许多多无名的服装制做者们，却在这四种服装的基础上设计和制做出几百种式样的服装来，讲解员很有诗意的指着一件春装说：“春天已经来临了，姑娘们穿上这件粉红色的花上衣，配上一条呢料长裤，真不知比盛开着的桃花还要美多少倍。”许多姑娘听了她的话都骄傲的笑了。她又说：“天气再暖一些，这里还有许多夏季服装。这件雪白的上衣，袖口、领口和胸前都加上荷叶边，再穿一件天蓝色长裙，是一套少女们很理想的夏季服装。”当她介绍男女孩子夏天穿的滚红边的白色连衣裤时，很多妈妈都认为这种衣服又好看、又方便，赶忙拿着自来水笔和笔记本，站在旁边临摹。
    展览会上陈列的服装，绝大部分都保留了民族服装的特色，同时也吸收了一部分外国服装的优点，使这些衣服更适合今天我们劳动和生活的需要。有很多妇女感到穿旗袍虽然好看，就是不太方便。在这个展览会有几件旗袍就避免了这个缺点，在开叉地方加上褶缝，看上去和以前的旗袍没什么不同，但是走起路来却不受衣服的限制。还有为喂奶的妈妈设计的双襟小短袄，为孕妇设计的下摆宽大的短外衣，都是既方便又不失美观的衣服。用泡泡纱做的短袄和裤子，再用花布滚边，是家庭妇女和农业生产合作社女社员喜爱穿的一种衣服。这些服装的选料和手工都是比较便宜的，一般妇女自己也可以动手裁制。
    在展出的服装的色泽方面也是很讲究的。这些调合的颜色给人一种舒畅和愉快的感觉。一个纺织女工看完展览会以后，在意见书上写道：“我感谢这个展览会，因为它启发了我更热爱生活，并使我认识到怎样正确的处理自己的服装。我一定要根据经济、美观、适用这三个原则，把自己的服装美化起来。”
    劳动人民创造了物质财富，也创造了美，他们能够把自己的国家建设成像春天一样美好，也能够把自己打扮成像花朵一样美丽。他们的决心一定会达到。
