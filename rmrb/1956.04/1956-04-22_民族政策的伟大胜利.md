    According to the resolution passed by the 7th Plenary Meeting of the State Council on March 9, 1955, and after more than a year of preparation, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was formally established.
    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao attach great importance to the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. They have sent a central delegation headed by Comrade Chen Yi, composed of representatives from all fraternal nationalities, democratic parties, and people's organizations in the country, to Lhasa to congratulate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee and to conduct consolation work in various parts of Tibet. Organizing such a large-scale central delegation to visit Tibet is the first time in the history of the relationship between the Tibetan people and other fraternal nationalities across the country. This is of great significance for further strengthening the relationship between the central government and Tibet and strengthening the unity between the Tibetan people and other fraternal nationalities across the country.
    The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is another great victory for our country's nationalities policy. It will surely bring new progress and development to the work in Tibet. For the progress and development of Tibet, and for the benefit of the Tibetan people as well as the people of the entire country, it is absolutely necessary to further strengthen the unity between the Han and Tibetan people, the Tibetan people and the people of all fraternal nationalities, and among all classes of people within Tibet. Our unity is based on the principle of anti-imperialism and patriotism, and aimed at building a socialist motherland. In recent years, the relationship between the people of all nationalities across the country, including the Han and Tibetan peoples, has made great progress. The signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" in 1951 changed the separation between the Tibetan and Han nationalities caused by the past rule of imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang. Thanks to the firm implementation of the nationalities policy, religious policy, and the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet by the staff members sent by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government to Tibet, and the troops stationed in Tibet by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, many beneficial things have been done for the Tibetan people, and the separation between the Tibetan and Han nationalities has gradually disappeared. Many delegations and visiting groups from Tibet have visited and studied in the interior. Through them, the Tibetan people have gained a further understanding of their great motherland and have deepened their understanding of the Han and other fraternal nationalities living together on the land of the motherland. The election of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni as national leaders and their participation in the management of national affairs have made the Tibetan people deeply feel the warmth of being in an equal, friendly and loving family in the motherland. The opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways has directly promoted the economic ties and cultural exchanges between the Tibetan people and the Han and other fraternal nationalities. All this has greatly strengthened the unity between the Tibetan people and the Han and other fraternal nationalities, and this unity has created extremely favorable conditions for the economic and cultural development of the Tibetan nationality. For the sake of the unity of all nationalities and the implementation of the policy of equality among nationalities and freedom of religious belief, we have always opposed the ideology and style of great Han chauvinism. Further criticizing and correcting the remnants of the great Han chauvinism ideology and style of some Han staff members will further develop the equal, united, friendly and cooperative relationship between all fraternal nationalities in the country.
    The progress and development of Tibet depend on the unity of all classes of people within Tibet. In the past, due to the rule and instigation of imperialism and the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang, Tibet had been in a state of long-term division for more than 30 years. It was not until after the peaceful liberation of Tibet that the Panchen Erdeni, welcomed by the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people, returned to Tibet. This was the beginning of great unity within Tibet, a great happy event for the Tibetan people, and also a great happy event for the people of all nationalities across the country. During their stay in Beijing, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni reached an agreement on historical and pending issues between the two sides based on the principles of "mutual trust, mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual love," pushing the internal unity of Tibet to a new stage. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established on the basis of this great internal unity in Tibet. Therefore, it is fully believed that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, people from all walks of life in Tibet will be able to better unite and do a good job in various tasks for the construction of Tibet.
    In the past few years, the staff members sent to Tibet by the central government and the troops stationed in Tibet by the People's Liberation Army have helped Tibet carry out some economic and cultural construction work. In the future, according to the unified national economic and cultural construction plan and the needs of Tibet, the central government will gradually increase its assistance to Tibet. Tibet has abundant mineral and hydropower resources necessary for industrial construction; Tibet has fertile land and good irrigation conditions, and it has been proven that it can grow a variety of agricultural and economic crops; northern Tibet has vast natural pastures, dense primeval forests growing in the mountains, and other abundant resources that remain to be developed and utilized. The future development of Tibet is bright. However, it will take considerable effort for the Tibetan people to fully utilize these favorable natural conditions and get rid of the backward state of the economy and culture. According to the decision of the State Council, one of the tasks of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is to be responsible for consultation and planning for matters related to the construction of Tibet. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the help of the people of all nationalities, the Tibetan people will surely be able to overcome difficulties through their hard work and greatly promote the construction of Tibet. The progress and development of Tibet will also be conducive to the socialist construction cause of the whole country.
    The development and construction of Tibet requires Tibetan cadres as well as scientific and technical personnel. In the past few years, the troops stationed in Tibet by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the personnel entering Tibet, in the process of building Tibet together with the Tibetan people, have helped the Tibetan personnel participating in the construction to master various technologies, and have helped the Tibetan cadres working together to study political theory. This is a very meaningful and valuable thing, and it should be vigorously pursued in the future. However, it must also be admitted that the current quantity and quality of Tibetan cadres and the speed of their growth are far behind the needs of the future development and construction of Tibet. The quantity and quality of cadres lag behind the needs of construction. This is not only the case in Tibet, but also the current situation in our entire country, which requires the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibet Local Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the troops stationed in Tibet by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all personnel entering Tibet bear a major responsibility for cultivating construction talents in all aspects of Tibet, and they must strengthen this work in the future.
    From the date of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, people from all walks of life in Tibet have a unified leadership organization of their own nationality with the nature of a political power. The Preparatory Committee will surely be able to fulfill its responsibilities well, unite the people of all walks of life in Tibet under the great banner of patriotism, and strive for the progress and development of Tibet and the socialist construction cause of the whole country.

### 民族政策的伟大胜利

    民族政策的伟大胜利
    根据一九五五年三月九日国务院全体会议第七次会议通过的决议，经过一年多的准备，西藏自治区筹备委员会正式成立了。
    中国共产党中央委员会、中央人民政府和毛主席十分关怀和重视西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，派出了以陈毅同志为首的、由国内各兄弟民族、各民主党派、各人民团体的代表所组成的中央代表团，前往拉萨祝贺筹备委员会的成立，并且在西藏各地进行慰问工作。组织这样规模的中央代表团访问西藏，在藏族同全国其他兄弟民族的关系史上是空前的第一次，这对于更加密切中央和西藏地方的关系和加强藏族同全国其他兄弟民族的团结是有重大意义的。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，是我国民族政策的又一个伟大胜利。它必将使西藏地方工作获得新的进步和发展。为了西藏地方的进步和发展，为了西藏人民和全国人民的利益，今后进一步加强汉藏两族人民、藏族同各兄弟民族人民以及西藏地方各阶层人民内部之间的团结是绝对必要的。我们的团结是以反帝爱国为原则、以建设社会主义祖国为目的的团结。几年来，全国各族人民、汉藏两族人民之间的关系有了很大的进步。1951年“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”的签订，改变了过去帝国主义和国民党反动统治所造成的藏汉民族隔阂。由于中国共产党和人民政府派到西藏的工作人员和中国人民解放军驻西藏部队坚决执行了民族政策、宗教政策和和平解放西藏办法的协议，为西藏人民作了许多有益的事情，藏汉民族的隔阂已经在逐渐消失。西藏地方派出许多代表团和参观团到内地参观和学习，通过他们，西藏人民对于自己的伟大的祖国更有了进一步的了解，对于共同生活在祖国土地上的汉族和其他兄弟民族人民的认识也加深了。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼被选为国家领导工作人员，参预国家大事的管理，使藏族人民深深体会到在祖国平等友爱的大家庭中的温暖。康藏、青藏等公路的通车，直接促进了藏族同汉族和其他兄弟民族经济的联系和文化的交流。这一切都大大地加强了藏族同汉族以及其他兄弟民族间的团结，而这种团结又为西藏民族的经济、文化的发展创造了极其有利的条件。为了各民族的团结，和贯彻民族平等和宗教信仰自由的政策，我们一贯反对大民族主义的思想和作风。进一步批判和纠正某些汉族工作人员的大民族主义思想和作风的残余，将使全国各兄弟民族之间的平等团结友爱合作的关系更加发展。
    西藏地方的进步和发展，有赖于西藏地方各阶层人民内部的团结。过去由于帝国主义和国民党反动势力的统治和挑拨离间，三十多年来，西藏地方内部长期处于分裂的状态，直到西藏和平解放以后，在达赖喇嘛和西藏人民的欢迎之下，班禅额尔德尼回到了西藏。这是西藏内部大团结的开始，是藏族人民的大喜事，也是全国各民族人民的大喜事。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在北京期间，双方在“互相信任、互相尊重、互相谅解、互相友爱”的原则下，就双方间的历史和悬案问题达成了协议，把西藏内部的团结推进到了一个新的阶段。西藏自治区筹备委员会正是在西藏内部大团结的基础之上产生的。因此，完全可以相信，西藏自治区筹备委员会成立之后，西藏各阶层和各方面人士一定能够更好地团结起来，做好建设西藏地方的各项工作。
    几年来，中央派到西藏的工作人员和人民解放军驻藏部队帮助西藏地方进行了一些经济文化建设工作。今后，根据全国的统一的经济文化建设的规划和西藏地方的需要，中央将逐渐地增多对西藏地方的帮助。西藏地方有着工业建设所必需的丰富的矿藏和水力资源；西藏地方土地肥沃、灌溉条件良好，已经证明可以种植多种农业作物和经济作物；西藏北部有着广阔的天然牧场，群山间生长着茂密的原始森林，以及其他的丰富的资源都还待我们去开发利用。西藏地方的发展前途是美好的。但是西藏人民充分利用这些良好的自然条件，摆脱经济、文化的落后状态，还需要相当长时期的努力。根据国务院决定，西藏自治区筹备委员会的任务之一就是负责协商和筹划办理有关西藏地方建设事宜。我们相信，在中国共产党的领导下，在各族人民的帮助下，藏族人民以自己的辛勤努力，一定能够战胜困难，把西藏的建设大大地推向前进。西藏地方的进步和发展，又将有利于全国的社会主义建设事业。
    西藏地方的发展和建设，需要有藏族干部以及科学技术工作人员。过去几年来，中国人民解放军驻藏部队和入藏工作人员，在和西藏人民一起建设西藏过程中，曾经帮助参加建设的藏族工作人员掌握了多种技术，并且帮助在一起工作的藏族干部学习政治理论。这是非常有意义和有价值的事情，今后还应该大力地去做。但是也必须承认，目前藏族干部的数量和质量以及成长的速度，就西藏地方发展建设的前途来说，还是远远落后于需要的。干部数量和质量落后于建设需要，不仅西藏地方如此，目前我们整个国家的状况也是这样，需要全国人民共同努力。培养西藏各方面的建设人材，西藏自治区筹备委员会、中国共产党西藏地方工作委员会、中国人民解放军驻藏部队和一切入藏工作人员负有重大责任，今后一定要加强这方面的工作。
    从西藏自治区筹备委员会成立之日起，西藏各阶层人民有了本民族统一的带有政权性质的领导机构。筹备委员会一定能够很好地履行自己的职责，团结西藏各阶层人民在伟大的爱国主义旗帜之下，为西藏地方的进步发展和全国的社会主义建设事业而努力。
