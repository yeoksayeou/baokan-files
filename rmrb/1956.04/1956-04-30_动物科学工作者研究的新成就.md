    Animal Science Workers' New Research Achievements
    Ten animal science workers presented their recent research progress and achievements at a paper presentation meeting held by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Zoological Society on the 15th.
    Young zoologist Wang Youlan presented a paper written by experimental biologist Zhu Xi and herself, entitled "An Experimental Study of the Relationship Between Oviductal Secretions of Toads and Fertilization, and a Discussion of the Mechanism of Sperm Entry into the Egg." This paper elaborates on the material conditions for the union of sperm and egg. The mechanism of fertilization has been a subject of debate among international zoologists for nearly fifty years. The conclusions drawn from the research of Zhu Xi and Wang Youlan differ from the views of some international schools of thought (such as fertilizin and estrogen). They believe that the male and female reproductive cells (ova and sperm) of toads themselves do not have mutual attraction; the success of fertilization depends on the secretions in the oviduct of the mother as a medium.
    Professor Zhang Zuoren of East China Normal University, in a paper on Paramecium, demonstrated the various detailed organelles in this single-celled animal. He discovered for the first time the true location and structure of the anus of Paramecium. This discovery is of great significance to the embryology of protozoa.
    Other animal science workers' papers also involved specialized issues such as the regeneration of animal limbs, wound healing in animals, castor silkworms, scrub typhus mites (a parasitic insect that can transmit diseases), and the formation of tumors. In zoologist Zhuang Xiaohui's paper "Regeneration of Newt Legs Without Nerves," he used experimental methods to prove that the legs of newt tadpoles can still regenerate after the nerves are removed. This experimental result breaks the view that the nervous system has a decisive significance for the regeneration of newt legs, a view that has always been held in modern zoology.

    动物科学工作者研究的新成就
    十位动物科学工作者十五日在中国动物学会上海分会举行的论文宣读会上，介绍了他们最近研究工作的进展和成就。
    青年动物学工作者王幽兰宣读了由实验生物学家朱洗和她所写的“用实验方法研究蟾蜍输卵管的分泌物对受精的关系并讨论精子入卵的机制问题”一篇论文。这篇论文对精子和卵子结合的物质条件有所阐发。受精的机制是近五十年来国际动物学家们一直争论的问题。朱洗和王幽兰的研究得出的结论不同于国际上一些学派的看法（如受精质和雌雄激素）。他们认为蟾蜍的雌雄生殖细胞（卵球与精子）本身没有相互的吸引力；受精现象所以能够成功，是依靠母体输卵管中的分泌物为媒介。
    华东师范大学教授张作人在关于草履虫的一篇论文报告中，论证了这种单细胞动物中种种细致的小器官。他第一次发现到草履虫的肛门的真正位置和构造。这个发现对于原生动物的发生学具有重要的意义。
    其他动物科学工作者的论文还涉及动物肢体的再生现象、动物的创伤愈合、蓖麻蚕、恙螨（一种能传染疾病的寄生虫）以及瘤肿的形成等等专门问题。动物学家庄孝僡的“没有神经的蝾螈腿的再生”论文，他用实验的方法证明蝾螈蝌蚪的腿去了神经之后，仍是可以再生的。这种实验结果打破了现代动物学界一向认为神经系统对于蝾螈腿的再生有决定意义的观点。（新华社）
