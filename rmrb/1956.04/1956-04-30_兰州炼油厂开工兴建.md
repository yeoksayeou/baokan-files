Construction of the Lanzhou Refinery commenced on the 29th. After Li Fanyi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, cut the ribbon, a mighty construction team entered the site and began work.

After more than two years of preparation, all preparatory work for this refinery has been completed. The ring railway and road leading to the factory area have been built. Six processing plants, including a wood processing plant and a precast reinforced concrete component factory, established for factory-like construction, have already begun production. Buildings of staff dormitories have been built one after another, filled with builders from all over the country supporting the Lanzhou Refinery.

The Lanzhou Refinery is China's first highly automated refinery, where workers rely on instruments in the control room to operate remotely. This factory is very large, with more than ten main production workshops. After its completion, it will have a very close relationship with China's socialist industrialization, agricultural collectivization, the development of the transportation industry, and the development of the Great Northwest.

    兰州炼油厂开工兴建
    二十九日，兰州炼油厂举行了开工典礼。在石油工业部副部长李范一剪彩后，浩浩荡荡的施工队伍进入工地，开始施工。
    这座炼油厂，经过两年多的筹建过程，各项准备工作已经就绪。通往厂区的环行铁路和公路已经修好。为工厂化施工而建立的木材加工厂、钢筋混凝土构件预制厂等六个加工厂，已经开始生产。一幢幢的职工宿舍楼房已经先后建立起来，住满了各地支援兰州炼油厂的建设者。
    兰州炼油厂是我国第一座高度自动化的炼油厂，工人们在值班室里依靠仪表进行远距离操作。这座工厂的规模很大，共有十多个主要生产车间。它建成以后，对我国社会主义工业化、农业合作化、交通运输业的发展等方面，以及大西北的开发，都有非常密切的关系。（本报驻兰州记者）
