Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: Chinese designers have recently completed the design work for major new products such as a 15,000 kW hydro-turbine generator and a 12,000 kW steam turbine. Trial production will begin soon.

　　The design of these new products was carried out with the help of Soviet experts. By absorbing new technologies from around the world, the designed products are relatively economical and rational. For example, the 15,000 kW hydro-turbine generator, due to the adoption of a new Soviet-style rotor model, can generate 20% more electricity than using the existing domestic rotor model, improving the utilization of water energy. By using a reasonable safety factor, the weight of this machine is seventeen tons lighter than the 10,000 kW hydro-turbine generator successfully trial-produced in China last year.

　　Currently, Chinese designers are designing major new products such as freight steam locomotives and cargo ships with a deadweight of 5,500 tons.

    我国设计师设计出一批重大新产品
    据新华社8日讯　中国的设计师们最近完成了一万五千瓩水轮发电机、一万二千瓩汽轮机等重大新产品的设计工作，不久就要开始试制。
    这些新产品的设计是在苏联专家帮助下进行的。由于吸取了世界上新的技术，设计出的产品比较经济合理。例如，一万五千瓩水轮发电机，由于采用了苏联新式转子模型，可以比采用国内旧有的转子模型多发出20％的电力，提高了水能的利用。由于采用了合理的安全系数，这台机器的重量比去年中国试制成功的一万瓩水轮发电机减轻了十七吨。
    目前中国的设计师们正在设计货运蒸汽机车、载重量五千五百吨的货轮等重大新产品。
