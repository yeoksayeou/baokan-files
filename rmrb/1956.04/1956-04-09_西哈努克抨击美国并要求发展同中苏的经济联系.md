Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 8th: According to an Agence France-Presse report from Phnom Penh on the 7th: Cambodian former Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sihanouk delivered a speech in Kampot, south of Phnom Penh. He said that he was surprised that a large country like the United States would rudely accuse him of being a dictator, treat him as a madman, and say that he had conspired to arrange the recent elections. He also said that the head of the government of a neighboring country (South Vietnam) received full support from the United States and was called a "true democratic figure."

Sihanouk said that since his recent visit to Beijing, obstacles had been set up for him in order to force Cambodia to change its regime. He said that the "bridge has been cut off" between him and the Americans.

Sihanouk called on Cambodia to develop economic ties with China and the Soviet Union in an attempt to balance Cambodia's relations with the United States. He said that if the Soviet Union wished to establish diplomatic relations with Cambodia, Cambodia should agree to it.

Sihanouk called on Cambodia to strive for national economic independence. Cambodia will need foreign aid in the next four or five years, and Japan, China, India, the United States, and France can provide such aid. At the same time, Sihanouk thanked the United States for its economic assistance, believing that without such assistance, Cambodia would fall into the "sphere of communist influence."

News reports say that Sihanouk also suggested in his speech that the new cabinet of Khim Tit should act in accordance with Cambodia's supreme interests without harming Cambodia's honor.

    西哈努克抨击美国并要求发展同中苏的经济联系
    新华社河内8日电　据法新社金边七日讯：柬埔寨前首相西哈努克亲王在金边南面的唝吥发表演说。他说，像美国这样一个大国，竟然不怕唐突地指责他是一个独裁者，把他当作疯人，并且说他阴谋布置了最近的选举，使他感到惊异。他又说，邻国（南越）政府的首脑得到美国的充分支持，并且被称为是一个“真正的民主人物”。
    西哈努克说，自从他最近访问北京以后，就有人对他布置了障碍，为了要迫使柬埔寨改变政权。他说他和美国人之间的“桥梁是截断了”。
    西哈努克要求柬埔寨发展同中国和苏联的经济联系，以试图平衡柬埔寨同美国的关系。他说，如果苏联希望同柬埔寨建立外交关系，柬埔寨应该予以同意。
    西哈努克要求柬埔寨努力求得国家的经济独立。柬埔寨在今后四、五年内将需要外国的援助，而日本、中国、印度、美国和法国可以给予这种援助。同时，西哈努克感谢美国的经济援助，他认为如果没有这种援助，柬埔寨将落入“共产党势力范围”。
    有消息说，西哈努克在演说中还建议让钦·迪的新内阁按照柬埔寨的最高利益行事而不损害柬埔寨的荣誉。
