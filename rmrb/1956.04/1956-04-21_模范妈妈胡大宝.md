Model Mother Hu Dabao

　　Hu Dabao is a model mother among the family members of the workers at the Nanhu Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province. Her daughter, Hu Linbao, is a weaver in this factory. She was also a weaver before, and now manages the household. She helps her daughter take care of her five children (the oldest is eleven years old, the youngest is two years old) and manages the household well, allowing her daughter to focus on production. She never takes leave and has become an advanced producer in the national textile industry. Now, she and her daughter have both been selected as representatives to the National Textile Industry Advanced Producers Conference.

　　Hu Dabao is fifty-six years old this year. While taking care of the children and managing the household, she often goes to her daughter's factory to understand her daughter's production situation. She cares about her daughter's factory as if she were still working in it herself. She hopes her daughter produces well, hopes the factory's production increases, and hopes the workers' lives become happier. Once, she discovered that her daughter was unwilling to teach her skills to other workers because of temporary conservative thinking. She was very distressed, thinking: This is the old society's way of doing things! Now, doing a good job in production is everyone's business. She told her daughter in detail about the suffering she had endured in the old society, so that Linbao would know how today's happy life was achieved. In the old society, Hu Dabao was forced to give two of her children away to others in order to survive. Linbao grew up in a broken cradle next to her mother's machine. Whenever Linbao had a day off, Hu Dabao always rushed to take care of the household chores so that her daughter could comfortably enjoy a pleasant holiday. At night, she would take the three children to her bed to sleep, so that Linbao could sleep well at night and have energy for production during the day. When Linbao worked the night shift, she would also find ways to take care of the children so that Linbao could rest during the day. Sometimes, she found Linbao returning home from work unhappy. She thought: There must be a problem in production, adding to her worries. She patiently helped her daughter solve the difficulties in operation. Because she had such a good mother, Linbao had never been absent from work in the five years since she joined the factory. Her skills improved rapidly, and under the education of collectivist thought, she actively shared her operating skills with all the workers in her group, making her group a model group in the entire factory.

    葛娴
    胡大宝是浙江省嘉兴县南湖染织厂职工家属中的一个模范妈妈。她的女儿胡林宝是这个厂的织布工，她早先也是一个织布工人，现在在管理家务。她帮助她的女儿带好五个孩子（最大的十一岁，最小的二岁），搞好家务，使她的女儿一心钻研生产，从来不缺勤，成了全国纺织工业中的一个先进生产者。现在，她和她的女儿都被选为全国纺织工业先进生产者代表会议的代表。
    胡大宝今年五十六岁了，她在一面带好孩子，一面管好家务以外，还常常到她女儿的工厂里去了解女儿的生产情况。她关心她女儿做工的工厂，就像自己仍旧在工厂里做工一样，她希望女儿生产得好，希望工厂生产提高，希望工人的生活更加幸福。有一次她发现女儿因一时思想保守，不愿把技术教给别的工人的时候，她就很痛心，心想：这是旧社会的做法呀！现在搞好生产是大家的事。她就把她在旧社会里所受的痛苦详细告诉她的女儿，要林宝更加知道今天的幸福生活是怎么得来的。在旧社会里，胡大宝为了生活，曾被迫把两个孩子送给了别人，林宝是在她妈妈机器旁边的破摇篮里长大的。每逢林宝休息的日子，胡大宝总抢着把家里料理得妥妥当当，让女儿能舒舒服服地过个愉快的假日。晚上，她把三个孩子抱到自己床上睡觉，让林宝夜里睡得好，白天生产有精神。遇到林宝做夜班，她也是想法带好孩子，让林宝白天能休息。有时她发现林宝放工回家闷闷不乐，她就想：准是生产上有了问题，添了心事。她就耐心地帮助她的女儿解决操作上的困难。因为有这样一个好妈妈，所以林宝在进厂五年多来，从来没有缺过勤，技术提高很快，在集体主义思想的教养下，她积极把她的操作技术告诉全组工人，使她们这个小组也成为全厂的模范小组。
