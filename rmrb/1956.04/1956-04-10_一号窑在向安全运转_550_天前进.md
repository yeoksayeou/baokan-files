Kiln No. 1 Marches Towards 550 Days of Safe Operation
By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming

Liu Dongcheng, the leader of the No. 1 kiln group at the Nanjing Joint State-Private Jiangnan Cement Factory, is a 65-year-old worker with nearly 40 years of experience in tending the kiln. He is careful and cautious, prefers to burn a small fire, and the kiln operates relatively normally, but the unit output is very low. The leader of the No. 2 kiln group has more than ten years of experience in tending the kiln. He is bold and enthusiastic, likes to burn a large fire, and the unit output is higher, but the situation inside the kiln is abnormal. In the labor competition launched at the beginning of last year, the leader of the No. 2 kiln group learned from the advanced experience of the Guangzhou Cement Factory, improved the operation, appropriately reduced the fire, adjusted production according to the instrument readings, and unified the operations of the three shifts. In this way, the operation of the No. 2 kiln became more normal, and the output was also high.

What about Liu Dongcheng? He was unwilling to learn from advanced experience. Because their factory had promoted many advanced experiences in the past, but the factory's technicians did not study them carefully and misinterpreted the three major experiences of water cooling, rapid kiln rotation, and long-term safe operation as the "three major policies" of "more coal, more wind, and more materials." As soon as they arrived at the site, they shouted, "Open the air vent wider, wider!" As a result, the combination of coal, wind, and materials was not appropriate, which disrupted production. They initially learned the experience of "hanging kiln skin" from the Guangzhou Cement Factory, but because the original technical summary was not comprehensive, the learning effect was not good. This left a deep impression on Liu Dongcheng. No matter how the leadership talked about it, they always emphasized that the situations of each factory were different, and believed that "advanced experience is good, but our factory cannot learn it." He still operated with his old methods. If his shift did not learn advanced experience, the kiln tenders of other shifts wanted to learn, and the three-shift operation of the No. 1 kiln naturally could not be unified. As a result, the No. 1 kiln not only had low output, but once "ring formation" (the material formed a thick ring on the kiln wall, which became thicker and thicker, and severely blocked the kiln passage, causing a red kiln accident) lasted for seven days and seven nights, reducing production by more than one ton per hour.

As a result, the average hourly output of the No. 2 kiln reached 17.03 tons; the No. 1 kiln only reached 16.5 tons. The No. 2 kiln was rated as an excellent group; the leader of the No. 2 kiln was rated as an advanced worker. This greatly stimulated Liu Dongcheng. However, he did not initially examine his own shortcomings, but instead ran to ask the Party Committee Secretary unconvincedly: "What is called advanced?"

The factory leadership usually respects and takes care of old workers like Liu Dongcheng. No matter which unit of the factory he goes to, the person in charge of that unit warmly receives him and listens to his opinions with an open mind. In the hot weather, they were afraid that he would not be able to withstand the heat due to his age, so they asked him not to work. When he went home at night, they were afraid that he would fall on the road, so they asked young workers to accompany him. The young workers also took good care of the master workers, and they automatically went to his house to carry coal, install stoves, and help with some heavy work.

However, everyone did not accommodate him this time. Because, according to the calculation of the Bureau of Building Materials Industry, if the kilns across the country were increased to 100 days of safe operation on the basis of the current situation, they could increase the production of more than 270,000 tons of cement a year; while their No. 1 kiln only operated for an average of 38 days the year before last, and the lowest was only nine days. How can we achieve more than 100 days?

The No. 3 kiln of the Guangzhou Xicun Cement Factory has set an example for the whole country in terms of long-term operation. It has created a record of more than 300 days of operation for three consecutive times, and the last time was 367 days. It is very obvious that to make the cement kiln operate safely for a long time, we must learn from the advanced experience of the Guangzhou Cement Factory and other factories.

At that time, the workers of the No. 1 kiln learned a lot of advanced experiences, from improving equipment, improving the quality of maintenance and kiln bricklaying, to strengthening the batching work, etc. Their method of "hanging kiln skin" was finally consistent with the experience of the Guangzhou Cement Factory. Therefore, how the kiln tenders learn the advanced operating methods of the Guangzhou Cement Factory to make the large kiln operate normally has become the key issue for long-term safe operation.

The Party Committee calculated the accounts for Liu Dongcheng and all the workers. The No. 1 kiln operated abnormally in the first quarter, and once it "ringed" for seven days and seven nights, reducing production by more than 200 tons of cement. This gave Liu Dongcheng and the workers a relatively clear understanding of the significance of safe operation in increasing production. They also encouraged Liu Dongcheng, saying that the advanced experience of others should be combined with your decades of experience to improve production.

Under the education of the Party, Liu Dongcheng changed his thinking of being unwilling to learn from advanced experience. He remembered that he had worked in the factory for decades in the past, and the capitalists still said to him, "You are old enough!" They disliked his age. He was afraid that if he made a mistake at work, he would be kicked out of the factory, so he only sought to avoid problems in operation, and he didn't care about the level of output. Now, the Party treats him so well, how can he still use old methods for production! So, he began to calmly ponder the situation of the No. 2 kiln and was determined to learn new things.

He first made a self-criticism in the group. Then, the administration promulgated the post operation method and the kiln head meeting system. At this time, Liu Dongcheng appropriately opened the air vent wider, increased the temperature inside the kiln, and adjusted production according to the instrument readings instead of relying solely on his own eyes to watch the fire. When new situations arose in the kiln, the upper and lower shifts jointly studied the treatment measures at the kiln head meeting and handed them over to the next shift for resolute implementation. In this way, the No. 1 kiln unified the operation of the three shifts with advanced experience, and production also had significant changes. The second quarter operated normally, and the average hourly output also reached 17.3 tons.

At this time, Liu Dongcheng became more active. As soon as a new situation occurred in the kiln, he checked everywhere, upstairs and downstairs, in front of and behind the kiln, looking for the cause and thinking of solutions. In order to implement the kiln head meeting system, he had to rush to participate twice a day regardless of wind or rain, and study the production situation with everyone. He also combined his decades of experience with advanced experience, and used the method of combining burning a large fire and burning a small fire to handle the "ring formation" problem three times in a row, all of which were handled very well. "Ring formation" is a strong enemy of long-term operation of cement kilns. The administration sent technicians to follow him to watch the fire and help him summarize his experience. After two summaries, they figured out that Liu Dongcheng's experience used the principle of thermal expansion and contraction of objects. The factory decided to immediately promote his method of handling "ring formation" in each shift.

At this time, because he was unwilling to learn from advanced experience in the past, some workers were also unwilling to learn from him. He became anxious: "Why don't you learn? I'll report to the Party Committee!" The leadership persuaded him not to be impatient on the one hand, and publicized the benefits of this experience to the workers on the other hand.

One day, Liu Dongcheng was just recovering from his illness, and the factory director persuaded him to rest for a few more days before going to work, but unexpectedly the No. 1 kiln "ringed" again. As soon as he heard about this situation, he couldn't stay at home, so he hurried to the kiln to take a look. The "ring" was very serious. He immediately looked for the cause everywhere, and used the method of combining large fire and small fire to burn off some of the ring. Then, he went to work. However, this "ring formation" was difficult to handle. He burned off some during his shift, and it thickened again in other shifts. At this time, the factory summoned all the workers of the three shifts to his shift to specifically learn his operating experience, and then the "ring formation" was burned off.

The No. 1 kiln had been operating safely for more than 200 days, and the director of the workshop to which it belonged returned from studying at the Guangzhou Cement Factory. He organized workers to conduct technical learning, and further learned the advanced operating principles and the advanced experience of the Guangzhou Cement Factory. At this time, they put forward the slogan: "Learn from the Guangzhou Cement Factory and ensure safe operation for 367 days!" Encouraged by this slogan, Liu Dongcheng and the slurry workers, coal loading workers, and kiln tending workers jointly studied and worked out a method to prevent "ring formation" in the kiln, so that the No. 1 kiln did not have "ring formation" for two eighty-day periods in the second half of last year.

On February 12 this year, which was the first day of the Lunar New Year, the No. 1 kiln reached the record of 367 days of safe operation! On March 20, the No. 1 kiln operated for more than 400 days. In the past year, they have increased the production of 26,300 tons of cement for the country, worth 1.26 million yuan, and saved more than 85,000 yuan in repair costs. Now, the No. 1 kiln is still operating safely. The slogan they put forward is: Strive for safe operation for 550 days! (Attached picture)

### 一号窑在向安全运转550天前进

    一号窑在向安全运转550天前进
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    南京公私合营江南水泥厂一号窑的组长刘东诚，是位六十五岁的老工人，有近四十年看火的经验。他小心谨慎，喜欢烧小火，窑的运转情况较正常，但是单位产量很低。二号窑的组长也有十多年的看火经验，他大胆热情，喜欢烧大火，单位产量较高，但是窑内情况不正常。在去年年初开展的劳动竞赛中，二号窑的组长学习广州水泥厂的先进经验，改进了操作，适当地将火烧小些，按照仪表的反映调整生产，并且将三班的操作统一起来。这样，二号窑的运转就比较正常，产量也高。
    刘东诚呢？不愿学习先进经验。因为他们工厂过去也推广过许多先进经验，但是工厂的技术人员没有认真钻研，把水冷却、快速转窑、长期安全运转等三大经验曲解为“煤大、风大、料大”的“三大政策”。他们一到现场，直叫：“把风门开大、开大！”结果，煤、风、料配合不当，反而把生产搞乱了。他们最初学广州水泥厂“挂窑皮”的经验，也因为原来的技术总结不全面，学习效果不好。这就给刘东诚留下很深的印象。无论领导上怎样讲，他们总强调各厂的情况不一样，认为“先进经验好是好，我们工厂学不了。”他仍然用他的老办法操作。他这班不学习先进经验，别班的看火工人要学，一号窑的三班操作自然无法统一。这样，一号窑不仅产量低，有一次“结圈”（料子在窑壁上结成很厚的圈子，圈子越结越厚，严重时就把窑道堵塞了，造成红窑事故）结了七天七宿，每小时减产一吨多。
    这样一来，二号窑的平均小时产量达到17.03吨；一号窑只达到16.5吨。二号窑被评为优秀小组；二号窑的组长被评为先进工作者。这使刘东诚受到的刺激很大。但是，他最初并没有检查自己的缺点，反而很不服气地跑去问党委书记：“什么叫先进？”
    工厂领导上平日对刘东诚这样的老工人是很尊重、很照顾的。他无论到工厂哪个单位去，那个单位的负责人都热情地接待他，虚心听取他的意见。暑天，他们怕他年纪大抗不了热，便要他不上班。他夜里回家，怕他在路上摔了，便要青工陪伴着他。青年工人对老师傅也很爱护，他们自动去他家里挑煤、安炉子，帮助干些重活。
    但是，大家这次没有迁就他。因为，根据建筑材料工业局计算，全国各窑在当时的基础上提高到安全运转一百天，一年就能增产二十七万多吨水泥；而他们的一号窑前年只平均运转三十八天，最低只九天。怎样才能达到一百天以上呢！
    广州西村水泥厂三号窑，在长期运转方面为全国树立了榜样。它连续三次创造了运转三百天以上的纪录，最后一次是三百六十七天。事情很明显了，要使水泥窑长期安全运转，就必须学习广州水泥厂和其他各厂的先进经验。
    当时，一号窑的工人学习的先进经验是很多的，从改进设备，提高检修和砌窑砖的质量，到加强配料工作等。他们“挂窑皮”的方法，最后也作到和广州水泥厂的经验一致。因此，看火工人怎样学习广州水泥厂的先进操作方法，使大窑运转正常，便成了长期安全运转的关键问题了。
    党委向刘东诚和全体工人算了笔账，一号窑一季度运转不正常，一次就“结圈”七天七宿，减产了两百多吨水泥。这使刘东诚和工人们对安全运转提高生产的意义有了比较明确的认识。他们又鼓励刘东诚说：应当把别人的先进经验同你几十年的经验结合起来，提高生产。
    刘东诚在党的教育下，改变了不愿学习先进经验的思想。他想起过去在工厂干了几十年，资本家见了他还说：“够岁数了！”嫌他年纪老。他怕自己在工作中出点差错就会被撵出厂去，所以在操作上只求不出事情，哪还顾得上产量高低。现在，党待他太好了，怎么还能用老办法进行生产呢！于是，他开始冷静地琢磨二号窑的情况，也决心学习新的东西。
    他首先在组里作了检讨。接着，行政上又颁布了岗位操作法和窑头会议制度。刘东诚这时就适当地开大风门，提高窑内温度，并且按照仪表的反映而不是光凭自己眼睛看火来调整生产了。窑内出了新情况，上下两班便在窑头会议上共同研究出处理的措施，交下一班坚决执行。这样一来，一号窑以先进经验统一了三班的操作，生产也就有了显著改变，第二季度运转正常，平均小时产量也达到17.3吨。
    这时候，刘东诚更加积极了。窑内一发生新情况，他就楼上、楼下，窑前、窑后到处检查，找原因，想办法。为了贯彻执行窑头会议制度，他无论刮风下雨都要每天两次赶去参加，同大伙一起研究生产情况。他还把自己几十年的经验同先进经验结合起来，用烧大火和烧小火配合的方法，连续三次处理“结圈”问题都处理得很好。“结圈”是水泥窑长期运转的劲敌，行政上派技术员跟着他看火，帮助他总结经验。经过两次总结，他们弄清刘东诚这个经验是运用了物体冷缩热胀的原理。工厂决定立即在各班推广他的处理“结圈”的方法。
    这时候，因为他过去不肯学习先进经验，有的工人也不愿学习他的。他便急了：“你们为什么不学？我报告党委去！”领导上又一面说服他不要性急，一面向工人宣传这项经验的好处。
    一天，刘东诚病了刚好，厂长还劝他多休养几天再上班，哪知一号窑又“结圈”了。他一听说这个情况，在家里怎么也呆不住，便匆匆忙忙地赶到窑上一看，“结圈”结得挺严重。他马上就到处找原因，又用大火和小火配合的方法将圈烧掉了一些。接着，他就上班工作。但是，这次“结圈”很难处理，他当班的时候烧掉了一些，在别的班上又结厚了。工厂这时又把三班的工人都召集到他班上来具体学习他的操作经验，才把这次“结圈”烧掉了。
    一号窑安全运转到二百多天，它所属的车间的主任从广州水泥厂学习回来了。他又组织工人进行技术学习，进一步学习了先进的操作原理和广州水泥厂的先进经验。这时他们提出口号：“向广州水泥厂看齐，保证安全运转三百六十七天！”在这个口号鼓舞下，刘东诚又和料浆工人、上煤工人、看火工人共同研究出预防窑内“结圈”的办法，使一号窑在去年下半年有两个八十天没有“结圈”。
    今年二月十二日，正是夏历大年初一，一号窑达到了安全运转三百六十七天的纪录！三月二十日，一号窑运转到了四百多天。一年多来，他们为国家增产了两万六千三百吨水泥，价值一百二十六万元，节省了修理费用八万五千多元。现在，一号窑还在继续安全运转。他们提出的口号是：争取安全运转550天！（附图片）
