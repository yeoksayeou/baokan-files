　　Dalian Harbor is the junction of sea and land transportation and a distribution center for bulk goods. Many import and export materials going south and north are concentrated here and then transported to various places by ships, trains, and automobiles. The main departments responsible for this transportation task are the Dalian Railway Sub-bureau and the Dalian District Port Authority. More than 70% of the goods transported daily by the Dalian Port Station (located in the harbor) under the Dalian Railway Sub-bureau are related to the harbor. Therefore, mutual cooperation between the railway and the harbor is very important for the smooth completion of tasks.

　　However, these two units did not cooperate well in the past. The harbor believed that its work was important and that the railway should serve the harbor. When allocating loading and unloading forces, the harbor emphasized ships and neglected trains, sometimes assigning almost all the loaders and unloaders to unload or load ships, leaving the train cars idle. Sometimes, when many trains and ships arrived at the same time, external workers should have been requested to help unload the cargo, but the harbor insisted on waiting until the harbor's loaders and unloaders had finished unloading the ships before unloading the trains. As a result, railway cars were often heavily stockpiled, becoming temporary warehouses for the harbor.

　　The Railway Bureau, on the other hand, believed that railway transportation was as accurate as a clock, so the harbor should obey railway transportation and should organize workers to load and unload railway cars in a timely manner. The Railway Bureau did not send cars to the harbor in batches, so that the harbor could load and unload evenly, but sent as many cars as arrived. Because the harbor had limited manpower and could not unload so many cars at once, some cars could not be unloaded on time. At this time, the Railway Bureau demanded that the harbor pay a large amount of fines. But the harbor refused to pay the fines. As a result, the opinions of both sides grew larger and larger. When the railway sent cars to the harbor, the harbor sometimes refused to accept them, causing a large number of cars to be stockpiled outside the harbor, unable to enter the harbor for loading and unloading. The railway retaliated by not sending cars to the harbor in time when the harbor needed cars to load goods; sometimes, the cars were stopped before they were driven to the appropriate location, forcing the harbor workers to push the cars to the loading and unloading place themselves, wasting manpower and time. The Port Authority requested the Railway Bureau to dispatch cars according to the principle of "ships arrive, cars arrive", so that the cars could be driven to the side of the ship and the goods on the ship could be unloaded directly onto the cars, without having to unload the goods into the warehouse first and then load them from the warehouse onto the cars. This could save loading and unloading fees, warehouse fees, and car and horse transport fees. It could shorten the time limit for the transportation of goods. However, the dispatcher of the Railway Bureau thought that doing so was too accommodating to the Port Authority and disagreed.

　　The harmfulness of this lack of cooperation and mutual obstruction was even more clearly exposed in the first quarter of 1954, when the transportation tasks were particularly heavy. The materials suddenly increased in this quarter, and the Railway Bureau should have appropriately increased the number of cars to transport the stockpiled materials in the harbor in a timely manner; the harbor should have transported the goods from the front warehouse to the rear warehouse, so that the trains could drive to the rear warehouse and load cars in a timely manner. This would have created conditions for each other. However, the two sides were "bickering" there, so that many goods could not be transported in time, and the stockpiled goods became more and more, causing a serious situation of port congestion. Many ships originally scheduled to unload goods in Dalian were temporarily forced to change course to other ports to unload, prolonging the voyage miles of the ships and delaying the schedule of ships. The non-productive berthing time of many ships also increased.

　　After this serious accident, the CPC Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee and other relevant departments inspected this matter. The leaders of the harbor and the railway also initially checked their own mistakes and signed a transportation contact contract. However, because the staff at all levels on both sides did not criticize departmentalism and did not establish some necessary cooperation systems, the phenomenon of "bickering" still occurred frequently. On March 19th last year, many goods arrived at the harbor, and the railway was requested to send cars for loading and transportation. However, the Dalian Port Station, according to the order of the superior, was going to dispatch empty cars outward. When the harbor heard that the railway was dispatching cars without loading goods, it refused to unload the cars out of spite. The operations of both sides were interrupted for the whole night. At this time, the CPC Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee required all units to examine their management thinking in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session. When the leaders of both sides saw that such a serious matter had occurred, they felt that something was wrong and personally came forward to solve the problem.

　　However, this time also did not completely solve the problem. Because the leaders on both sides had an unwillingness to cooperate. The leaders of the harbor believed that to solve this problem, the harbor station should be handed over to the management of the harbor, otherwise the relationship would never be good. The leaders of the railway, on the other hand, believed that the harbor did not pay attention to the loading and unloading work of the cars, and only by handing over the workers who loaded and unloaded the cars to the railway department for control could the relationship be improved. It seemed that work could be done well without having a relationship with other departments. For such relevant departments, it is impossible not to have a relationship in work. If we do not establish an overall concept and overcome departmentalism, even if the Dalian Port Station is handed over to the management of the harbor, or the loading and unloading workers are handed over to the control of the railway, the "bickering" between the harbor and the railway will still occur.

　　In June last year, the CPC Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee convened a party representative conference, which strictly criticized capitalist management thinking such as departmentalism and lack of cooperation. After the municipal party representative conference, the political department of the Dalian Railway Sub-bureau immediately convened a meeting to examine past mistakes, and then convened a joint conference of relevant cadres to launch criticism and self-criticism. The Dalian Railway Sub-bureau also sent people to the port station to help with the inspection, and emphasized that the inspection should focus on the problems of its own department in terms of coordination and cooperation. The leaders of the Dalian Railway Sub-bureau, such as the director, the director of the political department, and the chairman of the trade union, also took the initiative to go to the office of the director of the Dalian District Port Authority to make a self-criticism and solicit the opinions of the Port Authority. The director of the Port Authority also made a self-criticism. Both sides admitted their mistakes. Later, the director of the Dalian Railway Sub-bureau issued ten instructions to the relevant departments, making specific provisions on how to strengthen coordination and cooperation with the harbor. The Port Authority also organized the relevant cadres at a scheduling meeting to focus on examining the losses caused by its own lack of coordination and cooperation.

　　On the basis of criticism and self-criticism, the prejudice was eliminated. Then, both sides strengthened contact with the cargo owners and signed a contact contract with the cargo owners, clearly stipulating when to transport what goods, how much to transport, and where to transport them. This strengthened the predictability of the work of both sides. At the same time, both sides established a joint office and established a forecasting system for the arrival of cars and ships. The harbor sent dispatchers to be stationed at the port station to understand the railway transportation plan in a timely manner, so as to prepare the loading and unloading force as early as possible. When the harbor holds a scheduling meeting, the railway also sends people to participate, so as to understand the harbor's operation plan and allocate cars in a timely manner. In this way, the work of both sides was communicated. In the past, the business meeting of the Port Authority only checked the loading and unloading of ships, but not the loading and unloading of cars, but now they are all checked. When more cars arrive, the Port Authority not only expands the starting volume, but also transfers people from outside to assist in unloading the cars. Therefore, the operation time of the cars has been generally shortened from 14 hours in the past (the regulation is 10 hours) to within 10 hours. In the past, the harbor did not consider the needs of the railway department when loading cars, how many cars were loaded with goods going to this destination, and how many cars were loaded with goods going to that destination, so that the railway department could not organize direct trains. Now the harbor actively helps the railway to compile direct trains, so there are many direct trains at the port station recently.

　　Now both sides are taking a consultative approach to solve problems. When contradictions are found, they take the method of calculating detailed accounts to analyze and see which aspect has the greatest interest, and then obey that aspect. After improving cooperation, the goods arriving in September last year, although more than any month when the port was congested in the first quarter, the port was still unimpeded. At the end of last year, the harbor heard that the Dalian Railway Sub-bureau had difficulties in completing the plan, so it took the initiative to provide assistance. Recently, the director of the Port Authority went to solicit the opinions of the director of the railway port station dispatch, and the director of the dispatch said: "In the past few months, I can't raise any objections to your harbor's work."

　　The process of these two units from "bickering" to cooperation shows that the key to improving cooperation lies in the leaders, whether they have an overall concept and a spirit of self-criticism. If both sides have a spirit of self-criticism, the problem will be easy to solve, otherwise, cooperation will never be good.

    从“扯皮”到协作
    毛先智
    大连海港是海陆运输的联结点，是大宗货物的集散地区。许多南去北往的进出口物资都集中在这里，然后用轮船、火车、汽车分别运往各地。担负这一运输任务的主要部门是大连铁路分局和大连区港务局。大连铁路分局所属大连港站（设在海港内）每天所运输的货物有70％以上要和海港发生关系。因此，铁路和海港互相协作，对于顺利完成任务非常重要。
    但是，这两个单位在过去并没有很好互相协作。海港认为自己的工作重要，铁路应该为海港服务。海港在配备装卸力量的时候重船轻车，有时几乎把所有装卸工人都派去卸船或装船，而让车辆在那里停着。有时候，车、船同时到达很多，应该请求外面的工人来帮助卸货，但是海港偏偏等海港的装卸工人把船卸完了再卸车。这样，铁路车辆往往被大量积压起来，成为海港的临时仓库。
    铁路局则认为铁路运输像钟表一样准确，因此海港应该服从铁路运输，应该及时组织工人装卸铁路车辆。铁路局向海港送车，不是分批送去，以便海港能够均衡地装卸，而是来多少车就送多少车。因为海港人力有限，一下子卸不了这么多车，有些车就不能按时卸货。这时铁路局就要求海港交大量罚款。而海港则拒绝交罚款。于是双方的意见就越闹越大。铁路向海港送车，有时海港就拒绝接车，使大量车辆积压在海港外边，不能进港装卸。铁路则加以报复：海港要车装货的时候，他们不及时向海港发车；有时没把车开到适当地点就停下来，让海港工人自己把车推到装卸的地方去，浪费人力和时间。港务局要求铁路局按船到车到的原则发车，这样可以把车开到船边，把船上的货物直接卸到车上，而不必把货物先卸到仓库里，再从仓里装车库。这样可以节约装卸费、仓库费、汽车和马车搬运费等开支。可以缩短货物运输期限。但是，铁路局的调度员认为这样做太迁就港务局了，不同意。
    这种互不协作、互相刁难的危害性在1954年第一季度运输任务特别繁重的情况下，就更加明显地暴露出来了。这个季度的物资突然增加了，铁路局应该适当增加车辆，把海港积压的物资及时运走；海港则应该把前方仓库的货物捣运后方仓库，使火车能开到后方仓库及时装车。这样就互相创造了条件。但是双方在那里“扯皮”，使得许多货物不能及时运走，积压的货物越来越多，造成港口堵塞的严重情况，许多原计划在大连卸货的轮船临时被迫改驶其他港口卸货，延长了轮船的航行浬程，延误船期计划。许多船舶的非生产停泊时间也增加了。
    这一严重事故发生以后，中共旅大市委及其它有关部门对这件事情作了检查。海港和铁路双方领导人也初步检查了自己的错误，签订了运输联系合同。但是，因为双方各级工作人员没有批判本位主义思想，没有建立一些必要的协作制度，“扯皮”现象还经常发生。去年三月十九日，海港到达的货物很多，要求铁路派车装运。而大连港站则奉上级命令，要往外排空车。海港听说铁路不装货物就发车，就赌气拒绝卸车。整个晚上双方作业都中断了。这时正好中共旅大市委要求各单位根据四中全会的精神来检查经营思想。双方领导人看到发生了这样严重的事情，感到有些不对头，才亲自出面把问题解决了。
    但是，这一次也没有彻底解决问题。因为双方领导人都有不愿意协作的思想。海港领导人认为，要解决这一问题，只有把海港车站交给海港管理，否则关系永远搞不好。而铁路的领导人则认为海港不重视车辆的装卸工作，只有把装卸车辆的工人交给铁路部门支配，才能搞好关系。好像不和其它部门发生关系，工作就能做好。像这样的有关部门，在工作中不发生关系是不可能的。如果不树立整体观念，不克服本位主义思想，即使把大连港站交给海港管理，或者把装卸工人交给铁路支配，海港和铁路两方面的“扯皮”还是要发生的。
    去年六月，中共旅大市委召开党代表会议时，严格批判了本位主义、互不协作等资本主义经营思想。市党代表会议之后，大连铁路分局政治处立即召开了会议，检查过去的错误，接着又召开了有关干部联席会议，展开批评和自我批评。大连铁路分局又派人到港站帮助进行检查，而且强调要着重检查自己部门在配合协作方面的问题。大连铁路分局局长、政治处主任、工会主席等领导人又主动到大连区港务局局长办公室去作检讨，征求港务局的意见。港务局局长也作了检讨。双方都承认错误。以后大连铁路分局局长又对有关部门下了十条指示，对如何加强同海港配合协作作出了具体的规定。港务局也在一次调度会议上组织了有关干部着重检查了因自己配合协作不好而带来了哪些损失。
    在批评和自我批评的基础上，成见消除了。接着双方又加强了同货主的联系，同货主订立了联系合同，明确规定什么时候运什么货，运多少，往哪里运。这样就加强了双方工作的预见性。同时双方又成立合署办公室，建立了车船到达的预报制度。海港派调度员驻在港站，以便及时了解铁路运输计划，好及早准备装卸力量。海港开调度会时，铁路也派人参加，以便了解海港的作业计划，好及时配车。这样双方的工作通气了。过去港务局业务会只检查船舶装卸情况，不检查车辆装卸情况，现在都检查了。车来多了，港务局不但扩大开头量，而且从外边调人来协助卸车。因此车辆的作业时间从过去十四小时（规定是十小时）普遍缩短到十小时以内。过去海港装车不考虑铁路部门需要，这个去向的货物装几车，那个去向的货物装几车，使得铁路部门无法组织直达列车。现在海港主动帮助铁路编直达列车，因此港站最近的直达列车特别多。
    现在双方都是采取协商的方法来解决问题。发现了矛盾，就采取算细账的方法来分析，看哪一方面利益最大就服从哪一方面。搞好协作以后，去年九月份到达的货物，虽然比第一季度港口堵塞时任何一个月的都多，但是港口仍然畅通无阻。去年年末，海港听说大连铁路分局完成计划有困难，就主动给予协助。最近港务局局长去征求铁路港站调度主任的意见，调度主任说：“这几个月来，我对你们海港的工作一点意见也提不出来。”
    这两个单位从“扯皮”到协作的经过说明，改进协作的关键，在于领导人员，是否具有整体观念和自我批评的精神。双方都有自我批评的精神，问题就好解决，否则，就永远搞不好协作。
