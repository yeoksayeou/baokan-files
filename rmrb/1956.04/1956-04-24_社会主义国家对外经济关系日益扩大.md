    India will import from Bulgaria wood processing, metal processing, forging, pressing, printing and other machinery, agricultural machinery, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, electrical equipment, pigments and diesel engines.

    Canadian House of Commons Approves Soviet-Canadian Trade Agreement
    Xinhua News Agency, based on TASS: The Canadian House of Commons unanimously approved the Soviet-Canadian trade agreement signed in Ottawa on February 29, 1956, on April 18.
    When requesting approval of this agreement on behalf of the government, Trade and Commerce Minister Howe emphasized that this agreement is beneficial to both parties. It reliably protects Canada's interests and does not contradict Canada's obligations to other countries.
    During the debate, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Fisheries Minister Sinclair, and members of various parties in Parliament spoke. They unanimously believed that the Soviet-Canadian trade agreement was an important contribution to improving relations between the two countries and helped ease international tensions.
    Social Democratic Party leader Coldwell said that the agreement was of great significance not only to Canada but also to the world at large, as it marked a desire to develop trade and promote the easing of international tensions. Coldwell called for expanding political and cultural ties between the two countries.
    Social Credit Party member Quelch pointed out that the Soviet-Canadian trade agreement would be warmly welcomed by the Canadian people. He said that if our trade with the United States was based on the principles underlying the Soviet-Canadian trade agreement, we would not have a huge deficit of billions of dollars in our trade with that country today. He said, "I think it would be good if we could buy from the Soviet Union some of the commodities we now buy from the United States."
    Independent member Thatcher expressed his belief that the Soviet-Canadian trade agreement was only the first step for Canada to conclude trade agreements with other socialist countries, including the People's Republic of China.

    社会主义国家对外经济关系日益扩大
    波兰和伊朗签订贸易支付协定
    据新华社讯  波兰和伊朗四月十六日在德黑兰签订了一项贸易支付协定。
    根据协定，波兰将向伊朗出口整套的工业设备、铁路车辆、汽车、卡车、拖拉机、化学品和药品、金属品、陶器、水泥、纺织品和其他物品。伊朗将向波兰出口棉花、皮革、锌矿、铝矿和干果等。协定的期限为一年，自签订之日起生效。
  印度和保加利亚签订贸易协定
    据新华社讯  印度和保加利亚在四月十八日签订了一项双边贸易协定。根据这项协定，印度将向保加利亚出口许多种商品，其中主要是铁矿、锰矿、籽棉、棉织品、麻织品、手工艺品、皮革和原羊毛等。
    印度将从保加利亚进口木材加工、金属加工、锻压、印刷等机器和农业机器，化学品和药品，电气器材，颜料和柴油机等。
    这项协定在签订后立即生效，有效期限到1959年年底。协定规定用印度货币结账。加拿大众议院批准苏加贸易协定
    新华社据塔斯社讯  加拿大众议院四月十八日一致批准了1956年2月29日在渥太华签订的苏联和加拿大贸易协定。
    贸易与商业部长霍威在代表政府请求批准这个协定的时候强调指出，这个协定对于双方都是有利的，它确实可靠地保护着加拿大的利益，并且同加拿大对其他国家承担的义务并不矛盾。
    在进行辩论的时候，加拿大外交部长皮尔逊、渔业部长辛克莱和议会中各党派的议员都发了言。他们一致认为苏联和加拿大贸易协定对改善两国的关系是一个重要的贡献，并且有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    社会民主党领袖柯德威尔说，这个协定不仅对加拿大，而且在很大的程度上对全世界都有很大的意义，因为它标志着发展贸易和促进缓和国际紧张局势的愿望。柯德威尔呼吁扩大两国间的政治和文化联系。
    社会信用党议员奎尔奇指出，苏联和加拿大的贸易协定将受到加拿大人民的热烈欢迎。他说，如果我们同美国的贸易以苏—加贸易协定所依据的原则为基础，在我们同这个国家的贸易中今天就不会出现数达十亿美元的巨额赤字。他说：“我认为，如果我们能够向苏联购买现在我们向美国购买的某些商品，那是很好的。”
    无党无派议员柴契尔表示相信，苏—加贸易协定只是加拿大同其他社会主义国家，包括中华人民共和国，缔结贸易协定的第一步。
