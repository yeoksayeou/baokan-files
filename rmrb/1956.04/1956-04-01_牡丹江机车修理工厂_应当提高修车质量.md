To the Editor:

On November 27, 1955, a locomotive entrusted to the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory by the Suihua Locomotive Depot for repair was released from the factory. At that time, Chai Yaokui, the receiving personnel from the Suihua Locomotive Depot, discovered that the connecting rod was binding, which could lead to the phenomenon of axle burning, and requested further repair. However, the factory ignored this request. After a long dispute between the two parties, an inspector from the Ministry of Railways stationed at the factory ordered Chai Yaokui to accept the locomotive.

This repaired locomotive had only traveled two stations from Mudanjiang when the fourth connecting rod crank pin on the right side of the locomotive caught fire. Chai Yaokui immediately called the factory and requested that the locomotive be returned for further repair, but the factory, fearing that it would affect the completion of the factory repair rate target, decided to send someone to repair it. After two fitters repaired it at the Yimianpo Locomotive Depot for two days, the locomotive barely reached Harbin with a single engine. Later, the factory sent two more people to repair it for another day before the locomotive was able to reach Suihua. The Suihua Locomotive Depot repaired the locomotive for another two days and found many more non-standard parts.

Such accidents occur frequently at the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory. Last year, among the twenty-five locomotives overhauled at the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory by the Suihua Locomotive Depot, sixteen had a total of twenty emergency repair accidents after leaving the factory, with the locomotives out of service for more than 494 hours. After these locomotives returned to the Suihua Locomotive Depot, fifty tasks required rework and overhaul. In addition, due to the factory's poor repair quality, the washing and inspection downtime of locomotives was extended fourteen times, resulting in a loss of labor and material costs of 4,020 yuan for this item alone.

I believe that the Ministry of Railways should urge the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory to correct its irresponsible work style; the inspection personnel from the Ministry of Railways stationed at the factory should also earnestly implement the inspection system to prevent the release of substandard locomotives.

    牡丹江机车修理工厂
    应当提高修车质量编辑同志：
    1955年11月27日，绥化机务段委托牡丹江机车修理工厂修理的一台机车出厂了。当时绥化机务段接车人员柴耀魁发现连杆蹩劲，可能会发生燃轴的现象，要求加修。但是厂方却置之不理。双方争执了很久，铁道部一位驻厂的验收员竟命令柴耀魁非接车不行。
    这辆经过修理的机车从牡丹江开出，刚走过两站，机车右侧的第四连杆曲拐销就燃着了。柴耀魁马上给工厂打电话要求让机车返厂加修，但是工厂怕影响厂修率指标的完成，就决定派人去修。经过两名钳工在一面坡机务段修了两天，机车才勉强用单机走到哈尔滨。后来工厂又派来两个人修了一天，机车才开到绥化。绥化机务段把这辆机车又修理了两天，结果又找出了很多不合规格的地方。
    这样的事故，在牡丹江机车修理工厂是经常发生的。去年绥化机务段在牡丹江机车修理工厂检修的二十五台机车中，有十六台在出厂后连续发生临修事故共二十次，机车停修时间有494小时以上。这些机车回到绥化机务段以后，有五十件活需要返工大修。此外，由于厂方修车质量低劣，机车在洗检时有十四次延长了洗检停修时间，仅这一项损失的人工费和材料费就有4，020元。
    我认为：铁道部应该督促牡丹江机车修理工厂纠正不负责任的工作作风；铁道部驻厂的验收工作人员更应该认真执行验收制度，防止放出质量不良的机车。
