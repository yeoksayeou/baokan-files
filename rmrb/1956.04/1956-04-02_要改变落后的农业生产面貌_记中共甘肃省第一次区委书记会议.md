To Change the Backward Face of Agricultural Production
—Record of the First District Committee Secretary Meeting of the CCP Gansu Provincial Committee—
		Liu Bang, Yan Shugui
This year, Gansu Province must complete the agricultural production increase task of 2.5 billion jin of grain and more than 150,000 dan of cotton. This increase task is quite substantial. Grain production must increase from more than 7.8 billion jin last year to more than 10.3 billion jin, an increase of 31.8% compared to the actual production last year. Cotton production must increase from more than 99,800 dan last year to more than 252,000 dan, an increase of 152% compared to the actual production last year.

In order to ensure the victorious completion of this arduous task, the CCP Gansu Provincial Committee convened a cadre meeting from February 27th to March 5th, including district committee, county committee, and prefectural committee secretaries and ministers of agricultural production cooperation. At the meeting, experiences were exchanged, understanding was unified, and tasks were assigned. From this meeting, people were excited to see that Gansu Province's production increase plan for this year is active, reliable, and has the conditions and basis to guarantee its realization.

The rural areas of Gansu Province have basically achieved cooperativization, and the rural social productive forces have been liberated. According to incomplete statistics, from last winter to the end of February this year, the province has newly built and renovated more than 23,400 channels, dug more than 363,000 wells and cellars, and tapped more than 200,000 springs and excavated more than 200,000 waterlogged ponds. In addition, many gullies, flood control dams, field ridges and terraces have been repaired. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in the province has increased by one to three times compared to 1954, and in some areas it has increased tenfold. The high labor enthusiasm of the peasant masses after cooperativization provides a strong guarantee for completing this year's production increase task.

Gansu Province has great potential for agricultural production. In the past, due to underdeveloped economy and culture, and poor technical conditions, agricultural cultivation in Gansu Province was generally very rough, many arable lands were still barren, water sources were not rationally utilized, fertilizer sources were not fully developed, and pests and diseases were still very serious. Taking water conservancy as an example, this year, simply by building water conservancy projects and saving water, we can increase the irrigated area by 5 million mu. These irrigated areas alone can increase grain production by more than 750 million jin a year. Coupled with improved farming techniques, the use of new agricultural tools, the promotion of improved varieties, and the elimination of pests and diseases, the output of grain and cotton will inevitably increase greatly. The labor utilization rate and productivity in Gansu Province are also very low. Increasing the labor utilization rate alone can increase the number of working days by about one-third.

Currently, many high-yield achievements have emerged in different regions of Gansu Province. Twenty-seven counties in the province have achieved high-yield records of 1,000 to 1,500 jin per mu for crops such as wheat, corn, rice, millet, broomcorn millet, and sorghum; seven counties have achieved high-yield records of 7,000 to 10,000 jin per mu for potatoes; and two counties have achieved high-yield records of more than 200 jin per mu for cotton (lint cotton). These production achievements and experiences, if seriously summarized and promoted, can also increase the yield in other regions.

All of the above shows that it is entirely possible for Gansu Province to complete this year's production increase task. However, to turn "possible" into "reality," it is also necessary to have the correct leadership of the Party.

The meeting emphasized that running all existing agricultural production cooperatives well and ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of this year's grain and cotton production increase plan is the central task of rural work in Gansu this year, and other rural work must be carried out around this center. Therefore, the meeting believes that the work of transitioning from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives should be temporarily suspended across the board, and the socialist enthusiasm of the peasants should be guided to the current spring plowing production. As long as each cooperative increases production this year and the income of the members increases significantly, the work of transitioning to advanced cooperatives will be easier to handle in the fall. In order to ensure that each cooperative increases production and each cooperative is consolidated, the Gansu Provincial Committee decided to carry out two rectification campaigns in the first half of this year. The first one has already been carried out before the spring plowing, mainly in conjunction with formulating production plans, establishing and improving labor organizations, handling the remaining problems of establishing cooperatives, and launching labor competitions to do a good job in consolidating the cooperatives. The other one will be carried out before July, mainly in conjunction with formulating summer harvest pre-distribution plans, preparing for the summer harvest, and inspecting the implementation of the production plan in the first half of the year to carry out rectification of the cooperatives.

The meeting pointed out that to ensure that the central work of the year is done well, there must also be central work for each period and each segment. Party workers must be good at "long-term plans and short-term arrangements." At the same time, in the process of work, they must learn to summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner, and be good at using typical examples to promote general work methods. The meeting praised the work method of summarizing experience in a timely and concise manner, quickly promoting it, and quickly implementing it into the masses, and criticized the work method of waiting until the advanced experience has grown a beard before summarizing it into books, circulating it layer by layer, traveling around, and rarely meeting the masses.

The meeting also advocated the leadership method of "inserting a pole to the bottom." The Gansu Provincial Committee has decided to establish direct contact with ten advanced agricultural production cooperatives; it is necessary to regularly convene cadres stationed in key cooperatives and cooperative leaders to the province to hold forums and summarize and exchange experiences. The meeting also called on leaders at all levels to proceed from reality, study and solve specific problems, and overcome generalized leadership methods. The arrival of the high tide of socialist revolution and the high tide of agricultural production has brought many new and specific problems to the current leadership of the Party at all levels. For example, many female members are only willing to participate in agricultural and sideline production, but are unwilling to sew clothes and make socks; after livestock are priced and turned over to the public, the problems of members using livestock to mill rice, carry coal, and women going back to their parents' homes. These are all new problems arising in the process of cooperative development. If the leading cadres do not study and solve them in time, they will inevitably affect the production enthusiasm of the peasants.

The meeting pointed out that to complete this year's production increase task, it is also necessary to continue to criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking of "Gansu being backward." Although this kind of thinking no longer has a market, it is still impossible to completely eliminate it in the short term, and we must always be vigilant to prevent it from "sticking its neck out" again.

After the closing of this district committee secretary meeting, the participants have successively returned to their posts. They are rapidly conveying the spirit of this meeting to the more than 10 million peasants in Gansu Province. Once the Party's policies and thoughts are grasped by the masses, they will turn into a tremendous material force.

    要改变落后的农业生产面貌
    ——记中共甘肃省第一次区委书记会议——
    柳梆　燕树桂
    甘肃省今年要完成粮食二十五亿斤，棉花十五万多担的农业增产任务。这个增产任务是相当巨大的。粮食要在去年总产量七十八亿多斤的基础上增加到一百零三亿多斤，较去年实际产量增加31.8％；棉花要在去年总产量九万九千八百多担的基础上增加到二十五万二千多担，较去年实际产量增加152％。
    为了保证这一艰巨任务的胜利完成，中共甘肃省委会在二月二十七日到三月五日，召开了一个包括全省区委、县委、地委书记和农业生产合作部长的干部会议。在会议上，交流了经验，统一了认识，布置了任务。从这次会议上，人们兴奋地看到甘肃省今年的增产计划是积极的、可靠的，是有条件、有根据可以保证实现的。
    甘肃全省农村已经基本上实现了合作化，农村的社会生产力得到了解放。据不完全的统计，从去年冬天到今年二月底，全省共新修、整修渠道二万三千四百多条，打井、打窖三十六万三千多个，掏泉、挖涝池二十多万个。此外，还修了许多谷坊、防洪坝、地埂和梯田。全省积肥数量比1954年增加一到三倍，个别地区增加到十倍。合作化以后农民群众高度的劳动热情，就给完成今年的增产任务提供了有力的保证。
    甘肃省农业生产的潜力很大。过去，由于经济、文化不发达，技术条件差，甘肃省的农业耕作一般都很粗糙，很多可以耕种的土地还在荒芜，水源未得到合理利用，肥料来源也未充分开辟，病虫害还很严重。拿水利来说，今年光是兴修水利工程和节约用水等项，就可以增加水浇地五百万亩。这些水浇地一年就能够增产七亿五千多万斤粮食。加上改进耕作技术，使用新式农具，推广优良品种，消灭病虫害等措施，粮食、棉花产量势必大大地提高。甘肃省的劳动利用率和生产率目前也很低，光是提高劳动利用率一项，就可以使工作日提高三分之一左右。
    目前甘肃全省各个不同的地区，已经出现了许多丰产事迹。全省已有二十七个县出现了小麦、玉米、水稻、谷子、糜子、高粱等作物亩产一千斤到一千五百斤的丰产纪录；有七个县出现了马铃薯亩产七千斤到一万斤的丰产纪录；两个县出现了棉花亩产二百多斤（皮棉）的丰产纪录。这些生产成就和经验，只要认真加以总结和推广，其他地区的产量同样也可以提高。
    以上这些，都说明了甘肃省完成今年的增产任务是完全可能的。但是，要把“可能”变成“现实”，还需要有党的正确领导。
    会议强调办好现有的全部农业生产合作社，保证完成和超额完成今年增产粮棉的计划，是今年甘肃农村工作的中心任务，别的农村工作都必须围绕这一中心来进行。因此，会议认为目前由初级社转高级社的工作应该暂时一律停下来，把农民的社会主义积极性引导到当前的春耕生产方面来。只要今年社社增产，社员显著地增加收入，秋后转高级社的工作就好办了。为了保证社社增产、社社巩固，甘肃省委决定在今年上半年要进行两次整社工作。第一次已经在春耕前进行了，主要是结合制定生产计划，建立和健全劳动组织，处理建社遗留问题，展开劳动竞赛来做好社的巩固工作。另一次将在七月以前进行，主要是结合制定夏收预分方案，做好夏收准备工作，检查上半年生产计划执行情况来进行整社。
    会议指出：要保证做好常年的中心工作，还必须有每个时期、每个段落的中心工作，党的工作人员要善于
  “长计划，短安排”。同时在工作过程中要学会及时总结和推广先进经验，善于运用典型推动一般的工作方法。会议称赞了那种及时地、扼要地总结经验，迅速推广，迅速贯彻到群众中去的工作方法，批判了那种等到先进经验长了胡子才总结成本本，层层通报，辗转旅行，轻易不和群众见面的工作方法。
    会议还提倡“一杆子插到底”的领导方法。甘肃省委已经决定直接同十个高级农业生产合作社建立联系；经常要召集重点社的驻社干部和合作社领导人员来省座谈和总结交流经验。会议还号召各级领导干部从实际出发，研究和解决具体问题，克服一般化的领导方法。社会主义革命高潮和农业生产高潮的到来，给当前各级党的领导带来许多新的具体的问题。例如，许多妇女社员只愿意参加农、副业生产，不愿意缝衣服、做袜子的问题；牲口折价归公以后，社员碾米、驮炭，妇女走娘家使用牲口的问题等。这些都是合作化发展过程中产生的新问题，如果领导干部不及时加以研究和解决，势必影响农民的生产情绪。
    会议指出，要完成今年的增产任务，还必须继续批判“甘肃落后论”的右倾保守思想。虽然这种思想现在没有市场了，但还不可能在短期内彻底清除，必须时刻谨防它再“伸出脖子”。
    这次区委书记会议闭幕以后，参加会议的人员已经先后回到工作岗位。他们正在迅速地把这次会议的精神传达到甘肃省的一千多万农民中去。党的政策思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。
