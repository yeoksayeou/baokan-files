Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 28th. The Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party passed on April 28th the Korean Workers' Party's declaration to all Korean people for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

The declaration condemns the long-term conspiracy of the United States and the Lee Seung-man clique to divide Korea, and calls on the Korean people to take their destiny into their own hands and unhesitatingly struggle to achieve the unification and independence of the fatherland. The declaration states that in order to realize the nationwide desire for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland as soon as possible, the Korean Workers' Party appeals to all Korean people:

I. The final solution to the Korean question should be realized in accordance with the democratic will of the Korean people themselves; the unified government of Korea should be established through universal suffrage by all Korean people.

The joint government established as a result of free all-Korean elections conducted in accordance with democratic principles should have representatives of the broad masses of people, headed by workers and peasants, participate, and implement genuine democratic politics, guaranteeing the rights and interests of all strata.

II. In order to realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the achievements of the Korean armistice must be directed towards consolidated peace. Therefore, both sides must strive to strictly abide by the armistice agreement.

The North and South Korean authorities should announce to the Korean people and the people of the world their commitment: not to take any armed action against the other side, but to resolve all issues related to the unification of Korea by peaceful means only; and to reduce the North and South Korean armies to the minimum limit in order to reduce the burden of military expenditure and utilize it for peaceful construction.

For the peaceful reunification of Korea, the American interference that artificially divides Korea and the colonial rule in South Korea must be eliminated; all foreign troops, including the American army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, must withdraw from Korea.

The "ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty" and other unequal treaties must be abolished.

III. In order to enable the broad masses of the people to participate in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and to give full play to their patriotic enthusiasm and initiative, various democratic principles must be implemented in the entire social life of South Korea, and the lives of the people must be stabilized and improved.

IV. In order to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the existing artificial barriers between North and South Korea must be eliminated, and mutual contact and consultation between the people of North and South Korea must be carried out.

North Korea is open at all times and ready to welcome people from all walks of life and residents in South Korea who desire the reunification of the fatherland to come and go, to contact each other in various aspects, and will fully guarantee the personal safety and freedom of movement of people from all walks of life who come to North Korea.

In order to continue discussing the issue of Korean unification in accordance with the interests of all Korean people who desire mutual contact and consultation between North and South Korea, we propose: a standing committee composed of representatives from the parliaments, governments, political parties, and social organizations of North and South Korea.

V. In order to promote the peaceful reunification and independence of the fatherland, it is necessary to strengthen the national unity against American imperialism, unite all patriotic forces in North and South Korea, and strengthen the common struggle against the enemies of peaceful reunification. No matter who it is, as long as they oppose American imperialism and truly hope for national unity and the reunification of the fatherland, regardless of their political views, beliefs, or property status, we will welcome them and consult with them.

In order to unite all patriotic and democratic forces to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, we advocate that the political parties of North and South Korea take unified action, and that all social organizations unite.

VI. International agreements on maintaining peace in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean question should be implemented.

We hope that the countries concerned with the Korean question will convene an international conference with the participation of representatives from the governments of North and South Korea and with the participation of a wide range of Asian countries in order to maintain peace in Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean question; and we demand that the countries concerned undertake the obligation to ensure that no war or any action threatening peace will occur in Korea again.

The declaration finally calls on all people in North and South Korea to rise up and respond to the Korean Workers' Party's call for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and to defend the freedom and honor of the fatherland.
