Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 2nd. The Chinese Trade Delegation and the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation jointly held a press conference on April 1st in the exhibition hall of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition in Cairo. More than 80 representatives from Egyptian news agencies, newspapers, radio stations, and foreign newspapers stationed in Cairo attended the press conference.

    Ye Jizhuang, head of the Chinese Trade Delegation, delivered a speech at the meeting. He expressed his gratitude to the Egyptian government and people for the welcome and hospitality the delegation received during its visit to Egypt, as well as the assistance the delegation and the exhibition delegation received in Egypt.

    Ye Jizhuang said that the purpose of our visit to Egypt was to promote the friendship between China and Egypt and the economic and trade relations between the two countries. We hope to contact the Egyptian government and business community to seek ways to develop trade between the two countries.

    Ye Jizhuang mentioned that China has trade ties with more than 60 countries and has signed intergovernmental trade agreements with 20 of them. He said that our country's foreign trade is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit.

    Ye Jizhuang said that Asian and African countries, with a population of 1.6 billion and abundant resources, have great potential. Actively developing this potential and helping each other can lead each country to independence and prosperity, which is beneficial to world peace.

    Ye Jizhuang said: China has signed trade agreements with some Arab countries, such as Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. The trade relations between China and Asian and African countries are constantly developing. In August 1955, China and Egypt signed a trade agreement, and the trade volume between the two countries has increased significantly in the past year, and further increases are expected in 1956. We are willing to establish normal trade relations with Sudan, and we also welcome the establishment of equal and mutually beneficial trade relations with Libya and other African countries.

    After the press conference, the journalists who attended the press conference were invited to visit the Chinese Commodity Exhibition.

    我贸易访问团和商品展览团在开罗举行记者招待会
    新华社开罗2日电　中国贸易访问团和中国商品展览团四月一日联合在开罗的中国商品展览会展览厅举行了记者招待会。出席记者招待会的有埃及的通讯社、报纸、广播电台的代表和其他国家报纸驻开罗的记者八十多人。
    中国贸易访问团团长叶季壮在会上发表了演说。他对访问团在访问埃及期间所受到的欢迎和招待以及访问团和展览团在埃及得到的协助，向埃及政府和人民表示感谢。
    叶季壮说，我们这次访问埃及的目的是为了促进中埃两国之间的友谊和两国之间的经济和贸易关系，我们希望同埃及政府、工商界人士接触，以寻求发展两国之间的贸易的途径。
    叶季壮谈到，中国同六十多个国家有贸易联系，并且和其中的二十个国家签订了政府间的贸易协定。他说，我们国家的对外贸易是建立在平等互利原则这一基础之上的。
    叶季壮说，拥有十六亿人口和丰富资源的亚非国家具有巨大潜力，积极发挥这些潜力并且互相帮助，可以把每一个国家带到独立和繁荣，这是对世界和平有利的。
    叶季壮说：中国和一些阿拉伯国家，像埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩签订了贸易协定。中国和亚非国家的贸易关系正在不断地发展。1955年8月，中国和埃及签订了贸易协定，两国之间的贸易量在过去一年中有了显著的增加，预料1956年还会有进一步的增加。我们愿意和苏丹建立正常的贸易关系，我们也欢迎和利比亚以及其他非洲国家建立平等互利的贸易关系。
    招待会结束后，参加这个招待会的记者们应邀参观了中国商品展览会。
