    Let New Instruments Play Their Full Role in Production
    To the Editor:
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant is currently producing according to the 1957 production targets. Thanks to the active efforts of the vast majority of workers, the overall production task for the first quarter of this year has been completed. However, half of the plant's blast furnaces are unable to meet the 1957 production targets. The reason for this, aside from some operational technical issues, is mainly that the plant's leaders have not paid enough attention to the use of new instruments.
    When the leaders of the Iron Smelting Plant organized workers to discuss the national plan for this year, they promised at the beginning of the year to install new instruments on blast furnaces No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4 to ensure that workers could produce according to the 1957 production targets. However, this promise has not yet been fulfilled. Why is this? The main reason is that the leaders of the Iron Smelting Plant do not value the effectiveness of new instruments in their thinking. They believe that they can still complete the overall production plan without installing new instruments. This idea is wrong. The plant's technicians reflect: "Without an automatic sounding rod, it's like a blind man groping for a lamp; we simply don't know the temperature conditions of the furnace top and throat." This makes it impossible to implement advanced experience, and the output and quality of pig iron cannot be guaranteed.
    In addition, some new instruments, although installed, have not been fully utilized. For example, the automatic edge gas analyzer installed on blast furnace No. 8 a year ago has not been used to this day because the leaders believe it is difficult to use. A year ago, instruments for detecting furnace top gas temperature were installed on all blast furnaces in the plant, but the leaders did not help the workers learn how to use these instruments. Cai Huanan, a technician at blast furnace No. 6, spent more than four months last year studying and mastering the rules of the furnace top gas temperature detector and wrote a technical report recommending that the leaders adopt it. The leaders considered this technical report valuable and agreed to promote it in all blast furnaces, but they did not take any concrete measures. Therefore, to this day, only Cai Huanan's sixth blast furnace has used the furnace top gas temperature instrument; other blast furnaces have not used this instrument.
    Workers and Soviet experts alike are dissatisfied with the failure to utilize existing new instruments. The Anshan Daily has criticized this situation twice in a row, but it has not yet had any effect. We hope that the Anshan Iron and Steel Company will urge the leaders of the Iron Smelting Plant to quickly reverse their erroneous thinking that does not value the use of new instruments, so that the production of the Iron Smelting Plant can be improved.

### 让新仪器在生产中充分发挥作用

    让新仪器在生产中充分发挥作用编辑同志：
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂目前已经按照1957年的生产指标来进行生产。由于广大职工的积极努力，今年第一季度总的生产任务是完成了。但是，厂里还有一半的高炉不能完成1957年的生产指标，原因是除了操作技术上的一些问题以外，主要是厂里的领导人没有重视新仪器的运用问题。
    炼铁厂领导方面在组织职工讨论今年国家计划的时候，曾经答应今年年初要在一号、二号和四号三个高炉上安装新的仪器，以保证职工能够按照1957年的生产指标进行生产。但是直到现在，这个诺言还没有兑现。这是为什么呢？主要原因是炼铁厂的领导人在思想上不重视新仪器的效用，他们认为不安装新仪器照样可以完成总的生产计划。这种想法是错误的。厂里的技术员就反映：“没有自动探尺，像瞎子摸灯似的，根本就不知道炉顶、炉喉的温度情况。”这样就无法执行先进经验，生铁的产量和质量就不能得到保证。
    另外，有的新仪器虽然安装了，但是也没有得到充分的利用。例如，八号高炉在一年前安装的边缘瓦斯自动分析仪器，由于领导方面认为使用起来有困难，直到今天也没有加以利用。一年前厂里所有高炉上都安装了探测炉顶瓦斯温度仪器，但是领导方面却不帮助工人们来学会使用这种仪器。六号高炉技术员蔡化南去年经过四个多月的研究，掌握了探测炉顶瓦斯温度仪器的规律，并且写成了一篇技术报告，建议领导方面采用。领导方面认为这篇技术报告是有价值的，也同意在所有高炉推广，但是却不采取什么具体措施，因此直到现在除了蔡化南所在的第六高炉已经运用了炉顶瓦斯温度仪器以外，其他高炉都没有运用这种仪器。
    对于现有的新仪器不加利用的情况，不但工人们有意见，就是苏联专家也有意见。鞍山日报曾经连续两次对这种情况提出了批评，但是至今还没有得到效果。希望鞍山钢铁公司督促炼铁厂领导人迅速扭转不重视使用新仪器的错误思想，使炼铁厂的生产搞得更好。
