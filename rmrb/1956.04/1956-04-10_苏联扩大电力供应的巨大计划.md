    Soviet Union's Immense Plan to Expand Electricity Supply
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    Following Lenin's instructions, electrification in the Soviet Union is correctly regarded as the foundation for developing new technologies and increasing labor productivity in the national economy. After more than thirty years of effort, the Soviet Union has fundamentally changed the backward state of electricity production in pre-revolutionary Russia. Now, electricity production is nearly 170 billion kilowatt-hours, 34 times more than at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, and roughly equal to the total electricity production of Britain and West Germany.
    In the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan, which has already begun, further electrification is a thrilling undertaking permeating all sectors of the national economy. In industry, the automation of production processes requires more electricity and electrical equipment. The electricity supply per industrial worker in the Soviet Union will increase by 65% in the next five years. In agriculture, about 22,000 collective farms in the Soviet Union now use electricity. In the next five years, the number of electrified collective farms will double, and state farms and machine tractor stations will also be fully electrified. In transportation, railways will be extensively electrified. Within the next fifteen years, 40,000 kilometers of railways will be electrified. During this five-year plan, 8,100 kilometers of railways will be electrified. The electrification of railways will shorten the journey from Moscow to Irkutsk, a distance of about 5,000 kilometers, by two to four or five days.
    Precisely to meet the needs of such a large-scale electrification of the national economy and maintain necessary reserves, the Soviet Union will build and renovate more thermal, hydro, and atomic power plants during this five-year plan. A denser electricity grid will be laid out across the country, bringing electricity production to 320 billion kilowatt-hours in 1960.
    In the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan, electricity production is to increase by 88%, higher than the growth rate of total industrial output (65% in five years); at the same time, the growth rate of power plant generating capacity (increasing by about 1.2 times in five years) is higher than the growth rate of electricity production.
    How will the Soviet Union ensure the realization of the huge electrification program in the Sixth Five-Year Plan? The plan tells us that it is striving in the following directions: first, building power plants; second, adopting large turbines with high generating capacity; and third, establishing a unified power system.
    The Soviet Union will build many thermal power plants, hydroelectric power plants, and atomic power plants during this five-year plan. In terms of the total increase in generating capacity, thermal power plants are still the main ones, but in terms of the growth rate of generating capacity, hydroelectric power plants are developing faster than thermal power plants, increasing 1.7 times and 1.2 times respectively in five years. From the perspective of opening up new sources of electricity, the construction of many atomic power plants is of great significance. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union's first 5,000-kilowatt atomic power plant, in the year and a half after its completion, generated more than 20 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, consuming only about 5 kilograms of uranium-235. The total generating capacity of the atomic power plants to be built in the next five years will reach 2 to 2.5 million kilowatts, exceeding the total generating capacity of pre-revolutionary Russia. Two atomic power plants with a total generating capacity of one million kilowatts will be built in the Urals. An atomic power plant with a capacity of 400,000 kilowatts will also be built near Moscow.
    During these five years, the Soviet Union will build many thermal power plants with huge generating capacity. These power plants will be equipped with large turbine units of 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, and even 300,000 kilowatts, which operate with higher temperature steam and higher pressure. Large power plants are more economical than small power plants in terms of construction engineering, fuel consumption, and manpower. Large thermal power plants using local fuels will be built in Moscow, the Volga region, and the Urals. The Baltic Coastal Power Station, which uses local shale, has already started construction in Estonia. Large thermal power plants will be built in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and other republics.
    In addition to building new power plants, many thermal power plants built during the past five-year plans will be renovated in the next five years, mainly by replacing some low-pressure boilers and turbines with high-pressure units. Using existing factory buildings does not require increasing water supply and fuel supply costs, nor does it require increasing staff. After the renovation of the power plant, the generating capacity will increase by an average of 35%. A large amount of fuel will be saved every year.
    The construction of hydroelectric power stations, which utilize abundant hydropower resources and do not require fuel, is a huge task in the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan. Looking at the map of the Soviet Union, one can see that the major rivers of the Soviet Union, from west to east, are being gradually utilized for power generation.
    A series of hydropower stations are gradually appearing on the Volga River and its tributary, the Kama River, forming a ladder. The total generating capacity of the hydropower stations put into production in the Soviet Union during these five years exceeds 10 million kilowatts, more than half of which is generated by the hydropower stations on the Volga and Kama Rivers. Let us follow the hydropower station ladder down: the first Ivankovo Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River was built in 1937. Later, the 110,000-kilowatt Uglich Hydroelectric Station and the 330,000-kilowatt Shcherbakov Hydroelectric Station were built. The 400,000-kilowatt Gorky Hydroelectric Station is about to generate power completely. During this five-year plan, the construction of the approximately 800,000-kilowatt Cheboksary Hydroelectric Station will begin; the 2.1 million-kilowatt Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station will be completed, generating 11 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year; the construction of the one million-kilowatt Saratov Hydroelectric Station will begin; the 1.7 million-kilowatt Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station will be completed. In addition to these eight hydropower stations, scientists believe that an Astrakhan Hydroelectric Station can also be built. On the Kama River, the Kama Hydroelectric Station is nearing completion. During this five-year plan, the 540,000-kilowatt Votkinsk Hydroelectric Station will be completed, and the construction of the approximately 900,000-kilowatt Lower Kama Hydroelectric Station will begin. These hydropower stations using the "white coal" of the Volga and Kama Rivers can save the country about 25 million tons of coal per year, and save 130,000 workers who mine, transport, and serve these coal and power stations.
    On the Dnieper River, there was originally only the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station in Zaporozhye. In 1955, the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station was basically built downstream of it. In this five-year plan, the Kremenchug and Dneprodzerzhinsk hydropower stations will be built upstream of it, and the construction of the Kanev Hydroelectric Station will begin.
    While fully utilizing the rivers in the European part, the Soviet Union will begin to vigorously utilize the powerful rivers of Siberia in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This is a sign of the rational eastward movement of the Soviet Union's productive forces.
    On the Angara River, the first 660,000-kilowatt Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station can be put into production this year. The famous Bratsk Hydroelectric Station will partially generate electricity during these five years. This largest 3.2 million-kilowatt hydroelectric station in the world will generate 22 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, equivalent to the total power generation of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric stations. This huge electric power can replace the physical strength of 140 million people! The Soviet Union's long-term plan for using the Angara River stipulates that hydroelectric stations with a total generating capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts will be built on this river, and its annual power generation will reach 70 billion kilowatt-hours. The Ust-Ilim and Boguchany hydroelectric stations, each with about 3 million kilowatts, will be built during the future five-year plan period.
    On the Yenisei River, the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station, which is as large as the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station, is beginning to be built. The long-term plan stipulates that the Yenisei Hydroelectric Station to be built will have a generating capacity of about 5 million kilowatts! Hydroelectric stations with a total generating capacity of about 20 million kilowatts can be built on the Yenisei River, and their annual power generation will reach 130 billion kilowatt-hours.
    The total power generation of the hydroelectric stations to be built on the Angara and Yenisei Rivers in the future will greatly exceed the total power production of the entire Soviet Union in 1955, which is equivalent to saving 120 million tons of fuel.
    Connecting the electricity of thermal power plants, hydroelectric power plants, and atomic power plants across the country into a unified system is an important policy of the Soviet Union's electrification plan. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, a unified power system for the European part of the Soviet Union will be established, the work of establishing a power system in Central Siberia will be unfolded, and the power systems of the three republics of the South Caucasus will also be unified.
    The establishment of a unified power system will guarantee the maximum flexibility and economy of electricity consumption in the national economy. For example, after connecting the Ural and Central power systems, they can respectively bear the maximum load at different times, and the required reserve capacity can be reduced, so that about 500,000 kilowatts can be freed up from the existing total generating capacity.
    The powerful development of electrification in the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan is a measure of the unprecedented progress of Soviet production technology and the dramatic improvement of people's lives. It shows that the Soviet Union is advancing by leaps and bounds in realizing Lenin's idea of ​​electrifying the entire country.

    苏联扩大电力供应的巨大计划
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    遵照列宁的指示，电气化在苏联被正确地看作国民经济中发展新技术和提高劳动生产率的基础。经过三十多年的努力，苏联根本地改变了革命前俄国电力生产落后的状况。现在电力产量差不多有一千七百亿度，为第一个五年计划开始时候的三十四倍，约等于英国和西德的电力产量的总和。
    在已经开始执行的苏联第六个五年计划中，进一步电气化是贯穿国民经济各部门的动人心魄的工作。在工业方面，生产过程的自动化，需要更多的电力和电气设备。苏联工业工人配备的电力在今后五年中将增加65％。在农业方面，苏联现在约有二万二千个集体农庄使用电力，在今后五年中电气化的集体农庄将增加一倍，国营农场和机器拖拉机站也将完成电气化。在运输业方面，铁路将广泛地电气化。在今后十五年内，电气化的铁路将达四万公里。在这个五年中将有八千一百公里铁路电气化。铁路的电气化将使从莫斯科到伊尔库次克这段全长约五千公里的旅程缩短两天到四五天。
    正是为着满足国民经济这样大规模电气化的需要并保持必要的后备力量，苏联在这个五年计划时期将以更多新建和改建的火力和水力以及原子能的发电站，在全国布置更稠密的电力网，将使电力产量在1960年达到三千二百亿度。
    在苏联第六个五年计划中，电力产量要增长88％，高过工业总产量的增长率
  （在五年中增长65％）；同时电力站发电能力的增长率（在五年中增长约一点二倍）又高过电力产量的增长率。
    苏联怎样保证第六个五年计划中巨大的电气化方案的实现呢？计划告诉我们，它是朝着如下几个方向努力的：第一，建设电力站；第二，采用高发电能力的大型涡轮机；第三，建立统一的电力体系。
    苏联在这个五年中将建设许多火力发电站、水力发电站和原子能发电站。从发电能力增加的总量来看，主要的仍然是火力发电站，但从发电能力增长的比重来看，水力发电站比火力发电站发展得快，在五年中前者增加一点七倍，后者增加一点二倍。从开辟电力新来源来看，许多个原子能发电站的建设具有重要意义。大家知道，苏联的第一座五千瓩的原子能发电站在建成后的一年半期间发出了二千多万度电力而所耗不过约五公斤的铀235。今后五年建设的原子能发电站的总发电能力将达二百到二百五十万瓩，这超过革命前俄国的全部发电能力。两座总发电能力一百万瓩的原子能发电站将建立在乌拉尔。在莫斯科附近也将建立一座四十万瓩的原子能发电站。
    在这个五年内苏联将建设许多发电能力巨大的火力发电站。这些发电站将装备十万、十五万、二十万甚至三十万瓩的大型涡轮联动机，它们依靠更高温度的蒸气和更高的压力工作。大型发电站在建筑的工程、消耗的燃料、服务的人力各方面都比小型发电站更经济。在莫斯科、伏尔加流域和乌拉尔都将建设利用地方燃料的大型火力发电站。在爱沙尼亚已经开始建设利用当地页岩的波罗的海岸发电站。在乌克兰、哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯等共和国都将建设大型火力发电站。
    除了建设新的发电站以外，今后五年还将改建许多过去几个五年计划时期建成的火力发电站，主要是以高压机组来代替一部分低压的锅炉和涡轮机。利用现有厂房，不需要增加很多供水和供给燃料的费用，也不需要增加工作人员。发电站改建后，发电能力平均将增加35％。每年将节约大量燃料。
    利用丰富的水力动力资源和无需燃料的水电站的建设，是苏联第六个五年计划中的一项巨大的工作。翻开苏联地图，便可以看到苏联各大河流由西而东，被逐步地利用来发电。
    在伏尔加河及其支流卡马河上逐步地出现一系列水电站构成的阶梯。苏联在这个五年中投入生产的水电站的总发电能力超过一千万瓩，其中半数以上是由伏尔加河和卡马河上的水电站发出的。让我们顺着水电站阶梯而下：伏尔加河上第一座伊凡科沃水电站是在1937年建成的。后来又建成了十一万瓩的乌格利奇水电站和三十三万瓩的谢巴科夫水电站。四十万瓩的高尔基水电站快要全部发电。在这个五年计划期间，约八十万瓩的契鲍克萨利水电站将开始建筑；二百一十万瓩的古比雪夫水电站将完工，一年将发出一百一十亿度电力；一百万瓩的萨拉托夫水电站将展开建筑；一百七十万瓩的斯大林格勒水电站将建成。除了这八座水电站以外，科学家认为还可以建筑一座阿斯特拉罕水电站。在卡马河上，卡马水电站将近完工，在这个五年计划期间将建成五十四万瓩的沃特金斯克水电站和开始建筑约九十万瓩的下卡马水电站。利用伏尔加和卡马河的“白煤”的这些水电站一年能为国家节省约二千五百万吨煤，并且节省十三万名开采、运输这项煤和为发电站服务的工人。
    在第聂伯河上，原来只有一座在萨坡罗什的第聂伯水电站。在1955年在它的下游基本上建成了卡霍夫卡水电站。在这个五年计划中，在它的上游，将建成克里门楚格和第聂伯罗捷尔任斯克两个水电站，并将开始建筑卡涅夫水电站。
    在充分地利用欧洲部分的河流的同时，苏联在第六个五年计划中开始大力利用西伯利亚的强大河流。这是苏联生产力配置合理地向东移动的一个标志。
    在安加拉河上，第一座六十六万瓩的伊尔库次克水电站在今年可以投入生产。著名的布拉次克水电站在这个五年中将部分发电。这个世界上最大的三百二十万瓩的水电站，一年将发出二百二十亿度电力，等于古比雪夫和斯大林格勒两大水电站发电量的总和。这支巨大的电力可以代替一亿四千万人的体力！苏联利用安加拉河的远景规划规定，在这条河上将建筑总发电力一千万瓩以上的水电站，其全年发电量将达七百亿度。乌斯特—伊利姆和鲍古昌两个各约三百万瓩的水电站都将在未来的五年计划时期建筑。
    在叶尼塞河上，开始建筑和布拉次克水电站同样大的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站，远景规划规定将建筑的叶尼塞水电站发电能力约五百万瓩！在叶尼塞河上可以建筑总发电力约二千万瓩的水电站，其全年发电量将达一千三百亿度。
    在安加拉河和叶尼塞河上将来建成的水电站总发电量将大大超过1955年全苏联全部的电力产量，这相当于节约一亿二千万吨燃料。
    把全国火力发电站、水力发电站以及原子能发电站的电力联接成统一的体系，这是苏联电气化计划的重要方针。在第六个五年计划中，将建立苏联的欧洲部分的统一的电力体系，将展开建立西伯利亚中部电力体系的工作，南高加索三个共和国的电力体系也将统一起来。
    统一的电力体系的建立，将保证国民经济用电的最大机动和节约。例如，把乌拉尔和中央两个电力体系联接以后，可以使它们分别在不同时间承担最大的负荷，并且可以减少所需的后备能力，从而可以使已有的总发电能力腾出约五十万瓩。
    苏联在第六个五年计划中电气化的强大发展，是苏联生产技术空前进步和人民生活急剧提高的尺度。它说明：苏联在实现列宁关于全国电气化的思想上大踏步地前进着。
