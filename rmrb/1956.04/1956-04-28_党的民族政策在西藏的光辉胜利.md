The formal establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is the result of the correct implementation of the Party's nationalities policy in Tibet over the past few years, and another significant victory for the Party's nationalities policy. With the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, work in the Tibetan region will enter a new stage. This is a great joyous event for all ethnic groups in the country.

The Chinese Communist Party's nationalities policy is formulated by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, applying the principles of Marxist-Leninist theory on nationalities and combining them with China's specific conditions. It consistently upholds national equality, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation, and consistently opposes national oppression, discrimination, and division. Under the above general principles, the Party has separately, flexibly, and creatively formulated specific policies suitable for the current and long-term interests of various ethnic groups, based on the specific conditions of different ethnic groups in the country. Over the past few years, under the guidance of the Party's nationalities policy, the national problems in our country have been successfully resolved, including the special and complex national problem of Tibet.

From the founding of the People's Republic of China, the national relations in our country have undergone fundamental changes. The era of national oppression is gone forever, and the era of national equality has begun. All fraternal ethnic groups must unite closely in the strong and unified big family of the motherland under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and together with all fraternal ethnic groups, they can gradually develop the politics, economy, and culture of their own ethnic group in the cause of jointly building the motherland, and gradually eliminate the backward elements historically left behind by various ethnic groups. This is the only correct path for all fraternal ethnic groups in our country in terms of national unity and their relationship with the motherland.

In 1951, inspired by the correct nationalities policy of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the patriotism of the Tibetan people greatly increased, and their desire to return to the big family of the motherland became increasingly urgent. At this time, the Dalai Lama made a wise decision and resolutely chose the glorious and correct path of returning to the embrace of the motherland, and signed the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," which enabled Tibet to achieve peaceful liberation and complete the unification of the mainland of the motherland. This allowed the Tibetan people to forever break away from the shackles of imperialism, return to the big family of friendly cooperation with all ethnic groups in the motherland, and, like other fraternal ethnic groups, fully enjoy the rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief, and gradually develop the politics, economy, and culture of their own ethnic group in the cause of jointly building the motherland. This is the great beginning of the Chinese Communist Party's solution to the Tibetan national problem, and also the great beginning of the Tibetan nation and the Tibetan people embarking on the bright road to happiness.

After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, in light of the specific conditions of the historical national estrangement, the remaining influence of imperialism, and the backward state of politics, economy, and culture in Tibet, comprehensively planned policies suitable for the specific conditions of Tibet. First of all, they promptly and correctly established a clear banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism, calling on all anti-imperialist and patriotic Tibetan people, regardless of class, belief, or past grievances, to unite under the great banner of patriotism, strengthen unity between and within ethnic groups, consolidate the unification of the motherland, and work together to build a new Tibet. The patriotic leaders of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibetan people, together actively responded to this solemn call from the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and quickly set off a high tide of anti-imperialism and patriotism among the monks and lay people of all strata in Tibet. All anti-imperialist and patriotic people and deeds were respected and praised by the broad masses of people of all strata; anti-imperialism and patriotism became the central content of the political life of the Tibetan people, became the standard of glory, unity, and progress for the monks and lay people of all strata in Tibet, and became the basis for distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves and distinguishing between good and evil. Over the past few years, in practice, the Tibetan people have deeply realized that the interests of the Tibetan region are inextricably linked to the interests of the motherland, and that the interests of the Tibetan people are linked to the interests of the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland. They have unified the feelings of loving the Tibetan ethnic group and the Tibetan region with the feelings of loving the motherland and other fraternal ethnic groups. The broad masses of Tibetan people are proud to be citizens of a great People's Republic of China. The patriotism of the Tibetan people has been universally enhanced. Under this mighty momentum, a small handful of imperialists and Kuomintang special agents had nowhere to hide and became rats running across the street, chased and beaten by everyone.

The Party's policy of national unity in Tibet specifically includes two aspects: unity between ethnic groups, especially between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, and unity within Tibet. Over the past few years, while enhancing their patriotic consciousness, the Tibetan people have responded to the Party's call to strengthen national unity and unity within Tibet. In a long period of practice, under countless irrefutable facts, it has been proven that the People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet not only exemplarily abide by the policy of national equality and unity and respect the leaders of the Tibetan people and the Tibetan people as new Han people, but also are orderlies cultivated by the Communist Party who wholeheartedly serve the Tibetan people. This has greatly eliminated the historical estrangement between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, and greatly eliminated the historical suspicion and concerns within Tibet. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni have united, and the Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kampus Council have united, and the historical pending issues between the two sides have been fairly and reasonably resolved. The Party's policy of national unity has been correctly reflected.

While the patriotic sentiments of the patriotic leaders of Tibet and the Tibetan people are rising and the unity between ethnic groups and within Tibet is being strengthened, the Tibetan people have actively contributed their strength to consolidating the unification of the motherland and supporting the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet in road construction and various constructions. This is a manifestation of the Tibetan people's love for the motherland, and also a glorious support from the Tibetan people to the socialist construction of the motherland. This support from the Tibetan people has created favorable conditions for the motherland to help Tibet develop its politics, economy, and culture. Over the past few years, under the cordial care of the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and with the joint efforts of the Tibetan people and the People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet, significant achievements have been made in Tibet's transportation, cultural and educational, health, banking, trade, animal disease prevention, loan issuance, free distribution of agricultural tools, water conservancy construction, construction of various factories, and training of Tibetan cadres. All of this has laid a good foundation for gradually realizing the de facto national equality of the Tibetan people, and also correctly reflects the close relationship between the central government helping Tibet and the Tibetan region helping the central government, the Han ethnic group helping the Tibetan ethnic group and the Tibetan ethnic group helping the Han ethnic group. Through these vivid facts, the patriotism of the Tibetan people has been further enhanced and national unity has been strengthened. This is one of the sources of endless power for building the motherland and the Tibetan region, and is the foundation for the prosperity of the Tibetan region.

Universally and extensively training ethnic minority cadres is the fundamental key to realizing national regional autonomy and carrying out ethnic work, and is also an important part of the Party's nationalities policy. Over the past few years, the Party has paid great attention to the training of Tibetan ethnic minority cadres and has carried out a lot of work. These cadres have played a significant role in publicizing the Party's nationalities policy, strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, strengthening national unity, and developing various construction undertakings in the Tibetan region. In March 1955, the State Council's decision on helping Tibet to carry out various construction tasks stipulated that the original cadre school of the Tibet Military Region should be changed to the Tibetan Local Cadre School in order to train more and more systematically Tibetan ethnic minority cadres. Especially after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, with the development of various tasks, more Tibetan ethnic minority cadres will grow up in the practice of various practical work.

The Party's policy of freedom of religious belief and protection of Lama temples has also been correctly implemented in Tibet. The broad masses of Tibetan monks and lay people not only completely live a life of freedom of religious belief, but also have made progress on the original basis in strengthening the work of unity between various religious sects. The phenomena of discrimination and disunity that once existed have been basically overcome. In the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements, the people of all strata in Tibet have been able to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and distinguish between freedom of religious belief and the boundaries of using religion for evil activities, so that the plots of imperialists and Kuomintang special agents to use religion have suffered a shameful defeat.

The correct embodiment of the Party's nationalities policy in Tibet in various periods has created the foundation for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Now, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is about to be formally established. It can be believed that as long as we continue to correctly implement the Party's nationalities policy, national unity will be more consolidated, and the politics, economy, and culture of the Tibetan region will surely achieve greater progress and development.

    党的民族政策在西藏的光辉胜利
    范明
    西藏自治区筹备委员会的正式成立，是几年来党的民族政策在西藏正确实施的结果，是党的民族政策的又一重大胜利。随着西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，西藏地区的工作将进入一个新的阶段。这是全国各族人民的大喜事。
    中国共产党的民族政策是中国共产党和毛主席运用马克思列宁主义的民族学说的原理，结合中国的具体情况而制定的，是一贯坚持民族平等、团结、互助、合作和一贯反对民族压迫、歧视和分裂的政策。在上述总原则下，依据国内不同民族的具体情况，党又分别地、灵活地、创造性地制定了适合于各民族的当前利益和长远利益的具体政策。几年来，在党的民族政策的指导下，胜利地解决了我国国内的民族问题，其中包括了情况特殊而复杂的西藏的民族问题。
    从中华人民共和国成立之日起，我国的民族关系发生了根本改变，民族压迫时代一去不复返了，而开始了民族平等时代。各兄弟民族必须在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，紧紧地团结在强大的、统一的祖国大家庭中，和各兄弟民族一起，才有可能在共同建设祖国的事业中，逐步地发展本民族的政治、经济和文化，逐步消除各民族历史上遗留下来的落后部分。这是我国各兄弟民族在民族团结和祖国的关系上唯一可走的正确的道路。
    1951年，西藏人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的这一正确的民族政策鼓舞下，爱国主义思想大大增长，要求回到祖国大家庭中来的愿望日益迫切。这时，达赖喇嘛作出了英明的决定，毅然决然地选择了回到祖国怀抱的光荣的正确的道路，签订了“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”，使西藏获得了和平解放，完成了祖国大陆的统一。这就使西藏人民永远脱离了帝国主义的羁绊，回到了祖国各民族友爱合作的大家庭中来，和其他兄弟民族一样，得以充分享受到民族平等和宗教信仰自由的权利，并且在共同建设祖国的事业中，逐步地发展本民族的政治、经济和文化。这是中国共产党解决西藏民族问题的伟大开端，也是西藏民族和西藏人民走上光明幸福大道的伟大开端。
    西藏和平解放以后，党中央和毛主席针对着西藏历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂和帝国主义的残余影响以及政治、经济、文化落后的状态的具体情况，全面地规划出了适合西藏的具体情况的政策。首先及时而正确地树立起反帝爱国的鲜明旗帜，号召一切反帝爱国的西藏人民，不分阶层，不分信仰，不咎既往，大家一致团结在伟大的爱国主义旗帜下，加强民族间和民族内部的团结，巩固祖国的统一，为建设祖国的新西藏而共同努力。西藏爱国领袖达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和西藏人民一起，积极地响应了共产党和毛主席这一庄严的号召，在西藏各阶层僧俗人民中，迅速地掀起了反帝爱国的高潮，凡是反帝爱国的人们和言行，都受到了各阶层广大人民的尊敬和赞扬；反帝爱国成了西藏人民政治生活中的中心内容，成为西藏各阶层僧俗人民的光荣、团结和进步的标准，成为分清敌我界限和分清善恶的依据。几年来，西藏人民在实践中，深深地体会到西藏地区的利益和祖国的利益以及西藏人民的利益和祖国各兄弟民族人民的利益是血肉相关的，把爱西藏民族和西藏地区的感情同爱祖国和其他兄弟民族的感情统一起来了，广大的西藏人民以能作为一个伟大的中华人民共和国的公民而自豪。西藏人民的爱国主义思想普遍提高。在这一浩大的声势下，使一小撮帝国主义和国民党特务分子无处藏身，成了老鼠过街，人人喊打。
    党的民族团结政策，在西藏的具体内容是包括各民族特别是汉藏民族间的团结和西藏内部的团结的两个方面。几年来，西藏人民在提高爱国主义觉悟的同时，响应了党的加强民族团结和西藏内部团结的号召。在长时期的实践中，在无数不可辩驳的事实下，证明了进藏的人民解放军和工作人员，不仅是模范地遵守民族平等团结的政策、尊重西藏人民领袖和西藏人民的新汉人，而且是共产党教养出来的全心全意为西藏人民服务的勤务员，这就大大地消除了历史上遗留下来的汉藏民族隔阂，大大地消除了西藏历史上遗留下来的西藏内部的怀疑和顾虑。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼团结起来了，西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会团结起来了，双方的历史悬案得到了公平合理的解决。党的民族团结政策得到了正确的体现。
    在西藏爱国领袖和西藏人民的爱国情绪日益高涨和民族之间以及西藏内部的团结日益加强的同时，西藏人民在巩固祖国统一、支援进藏人民解放军修路和各种建设中，积极地贡献了自己的力量，这是西藏人民热爱祖国的表现，也是西藏人民对祖国社会主义建设的光荣的支援。西藏人民的这种支援，又给祖国帮助西藏发展政治、经济和文化创造了有利的条件。几年来，在党中央、中央人民政府和毛主席的亲切关怀以及全国各族人民的大力支援下，在西藏人民和进藏人民解放军、工作人员共同努力下，西藏的交通运输事业，文教、卫生事业，银行、贸易、兽疫防治、发放贷款、无偿发放农具、兴修水利、建设各种工厂和培养藏族干部等各方面的工作，都取得了显著的成绩。这一切，为逐步实现西藏人民在事实上的民族平等打下了良好的基础，也正确地体现了中央帮助西藏地方和西藏地区帮助中央、汉族帮助藏族和藏族帮助汉族的亲密关系。通过这些活生生的事实，进一步地提高了西藏人民的爱国主义觉悟，加强了民族团结。这是建设祖国和西藏地区的永无穷尽的力量的源泉之一，是使西藏地区欣欣向荣的基础。
    普遍和大量地培养民族干部是实现民族区域自治和开展民族工作的根本关键，也是党的民族政策的重要内容之一。几年来，党对于培养西藏的民族干部给予了极大的注意，并且进行了许多工作。这些干部对宣传党的民族政策、密切党和群众的联系、加强民族团结、发展西藏地区的各项建设事业，都起了很大作用。1955年3月国务院关于帮助西藏地方进行各项建设工作的决定中，规定把原西藏军区干部学校改为西藏地方干部学校，以便更多地、更有计划地培养西藏的民族干部。特别是在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立以后，随着各项工作的开展，将会有更多的西藏本民族的干部在各项实际工作的锻炼中生长起来。
    党的宗教信仰自由、保护喇嘛寺庙的政策，在西藏也得到了正确的执行。广大的西藏僧俗人民，不仅完全过着宗教信仰自由的生活，并且在加强各教派之间的团结工作上，也在原有的基础上前进了一步。过去曾经存在的歧视和不团结现象，已经基本上克服了。在反对反革命分子的斗争中，西藏各阶层人民都能分清敌我，分清宗教信仰自由和利用宗教进行罪恶活动的界限，使帝国主义和国民党特务分子企图利用宗教的阴谋诡计，遭到可耻的失败。
    党的民族政策在西藏各个时期中的正确体现，为成立西藏自治区筹备委员会创造了基础。现在，西藏自治区筹备委员会将要正式成立了，可以相信，只要我们继续正确地执行党的民族政策，民族团结将会更加巩固，西藏地区的政治、经济和文化一定会得到更大的进步和发展。
