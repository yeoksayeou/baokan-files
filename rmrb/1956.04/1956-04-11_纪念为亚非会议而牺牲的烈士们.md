    One year ago today, comrades Shi Zhiang, Li Zhaoji, and Zhong Buyun, staff members of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Asian-African Conference, Chinese journalists Shen Jiantu, Huang Zuomei, Du Hong, Li Ping, and Hao Fengge, Wang Mingfang, staff member of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Polish journalist Starewicz, Austrian journalist Ian Fader, and the crew members of Air India International, were unfortunately killed in an act of sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents while en route to Bandung by plane. All kind-hearted people feel extremely indignant at this lawless act of murder by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, and express their heartfelt respect and mourning for the deceased martyrs. These comrades and friends sacrificed themselves for the noble cause of peace, friendship, independence, and freedom of the broad masses of people in Asia and Africa. Their names are already linked to the historically significant Asian-African Conference. The passage of time cannot erase people's memory of them; they will forever live in the hearts of the Asian-African people and all upright people.
    Over the past year, the governments of China, India, and Indonesia, and relevant personnel, have made great efforts to bring the truth of this case to light, to safeguard human justice and dignity, and to avenge the deceased martyrs. On April 12, 1955, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country issued a statement, pointing out that the plane crash was a premeditated murder by Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organs. The Chinese government also successively provided relevant materials to the British authorities, requesting the British authorities to thoroughly investigate. On May 27, 1955, the committee appointed by the Indonesian government to investigate the case issued a report, "determining that the cause of the incident was an explosion of a time bomb placed in the right wing wheel bay of the aircraft." On September 6, 1955, Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in the Indian Parliament that this act of sabotage was undoubtedly carried out by personnel of a secret organization active in Hong Kong, which had close ties with Taiwan. Later, on January 11, 1956, the British government also issued a statement on the investigation of this case, which fully confirmed and affirmed the facts already pointed out by China, India, and Indonesia. This has provided a favorable basis for the complete solution of the case. This is something people welcome.
    However, on the first anniversary of the death of the martyrs such as Shi Zhiang, what all conscientious people find intolerable is that the case has not been completely solved, and the murderers are still at large. It must be pointed out that since the location of the crime in this case is Hong Kong, which is under British jurisdiction, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have the responsibility to bring the investigation of this case to a complete conclusion. On May 27, 1955, the British authorities in Hong Kong also stated that they were "determined to do their utmost to bring the perpetrators to justice." Therefore, we believe that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong should not stop at the current investigations; they should take effective measures to convict and sentence Zhou Ziming, the direct executor of this murder case. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong cannot shirk this responsibility. The Chinese people and the broad masses of people in Asian and African countries are concerned about this matter, and the relevant parties are willing to provide assistance. Therefore, it is entirely possible to complete the work of thoroughly solving the case at an early date.
    It has been a year since the martyrs such as Shi Zhiang were killed. Today, we can tell them with comfort that the evil forces that are hostile to the Asian-African Conference have not succeeded, and the Asian-African Conference has achieved significant results. The "Bandung Spirit" has had a wide and profound impact in the Asian-African region, and not only in the Asian-African region. Since the Asian-African Conference, the influence of the idea of peaceful coexistence has become increasingly profound and widespread, the peaceful and friendly relations between Asian and African countries have been developing day by day, and the national independence and self-determination movements in many oppressed countries have continued to achieve new victories. The historical face of the Asian-African region is changing with each passing day. The entire international situation is moving forward in an encouraging direction. This shows that the heroic struggle of the broad masses of the people has not been in vain, and the blood of the martyrs who sacrificed in this struggle has not been shed in vain. The people's wishes are being realized, and the martyrs' aspirations are being realized. No force can stop it. In the struggle to further ease the international situation and strengthen international cooperation, the Chinese people will unite with the people of Asian and African countries and work together. We believe that this is the best way to commemorate the martyrs.

### 纪念为亚非会议而牺牲的烈士们

    纪念为亚非会议而牺牲的烈士们
    一年前的今天，中华人民共和国出席亚非会议代表团工作人员石志昂、李肇基、钟步云，中国记者沈建图、黄作梅、杜宏、李平、郝凤格，越南民主共和国代表团工作人员王明芳，波兰记者斯塔列茨，奥地利记者严斐德和印度国际航空公司的机务人员，在乘飞机前往万隆的途中，由于受到蒋介石特务分子的暗害而不幸遇难。一切善良的人们无不对蒋介石特务分子这种无法无天的谋杀罪行感到万分愤慨，而对死难的烈士们寄以衷心的敬意和悼念。这些同志们和朋友们为亚非两洲广大人民的和平友好和独立自由的崇高事业而牺牲了。他们的名字已经同具有历史意义的亚非会议连在一起了。时光的流逝不能磨灭人们对他们的记忆，他们将永远活在亚非人民以及一切正直人们的心里。
    一年来，中国、印度、印度尼西亚政府和有关人员，为了把这个案件的真相大白于天下，为了维护人类的正义和尊严，为了替死难烈士们报仇，曾经作了很大的努力。我国外交部在1955年4月12日就发表声明，指出了飞机失事是蒋介石特务机关蓄意制造的谋杀。我国政府并且向英国当局陆续提供了有关的材料，要求英国当局彻底究查。1955年5月27日，印度尼西亚政府任命的调查这个案件的委员会发表了报告，“断定这次事件的原因是由于放在飞机右翼轮舱处的一个定时炸弹的爆炸所造成”。1955年9月6日，印度总理尼赫鲁在印度国会发言中指出：这一破坏活动无疑是在香港活动的一个秘密组织人员干的，这个组织同台湾有密切关系。后来，到了1956年1月11日，英国政府也发表了关于这个案件调查的声明，它完全证实了和肯定了中国、印度和印度尼西亚所已经指出的事实。这就使得这个案件的全部破案工作有了一个有利的基础。这是人们所欢迎的事。
    但是，在纪念石志昂等烈士遇难一周年的时候，一切有良心的人所感到不能容忍的是，这个案件还没有彻底破案，杀人犯们仍然逍遥法外。必须指出，由于这个案件的犯罪行为的地点是英国所管辖的香港，英国政府和香港英国当局有责任把这个案件的破案工作进行到底。1955年5月27日，香港英国当局也曾经表示，他们“决心尽全力来使肇事者归案法办”。因此，我们认为，英国政府和香港英国当局不能止于目前的这些调查，它应该采取有效措施，对直接执行这一谋杀案的凶手周梓铭定罪判刑。这个责任，英国政府和香港英国当局是推卸不掉的。中国人民和亚非各国的广大人民都在关心着这件事，有关方面也愿意给予协助，因此早日完成彻底破案的工作是完全可能的。
    石志昂等烈士被害已经一年了，今天，我们可以告慰他们的是：仇视亚非会议的邪恶势力并未得逞，亚非会议已经获得重大的成就。“万隆精神”在亚非地区，而且不仅亚非地区，已经产生了广泛和深刻的影响。亚非会议以后，和平共处思想的影响日益深入和扩大，亚非各国之间的和平友好关系日益开展，许多受压迫国家的民族独立和自决运动不断得到新的胜利。亚非地区的历史面貌正在日新月异。整个国际局势正在沿着令人鼓舞的方向前进。这就说明了，广大人民的英勇奋斗并没有徒劳，在这个斗争中牺牲了的烈士们的血并没有白流。人民的愿望正在实现着，烈士们的遗志正在实现着，不管什么力量都不能阻挡。在争取国际局势的进一步和缓和加强国际合作的斗争中，中国人民将同亚非各国人民团结一致，共同努力。我们相信，这就是对烈士们的最好纪念。
