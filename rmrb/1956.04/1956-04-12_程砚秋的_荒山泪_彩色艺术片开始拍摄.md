    Cheng Yanqiu's "Wilderness of Tears" Color Art Film Begins Shooting
    The famous 52-year-old dramatist Cheng Yanqiu arrived at the studio of the Beijing Film Studio on the 10th and began shooting the color art film of his representative work, "Wilderness of Tears." The film studio's crew set off firecrackers to congratulate him on the achievements he has made in his 42 years of Peking Opera artistic life.
    Wu Zuguang, the director of this film, told reporters at the studio that "Wilderness of Tears" is an excellent play that Cheng Yanqiu has frequently performed since 1930. The play reflects the plight and miserable lives of the people under reactionary rule through the story of the late Ming Dynasty.
    In the "Wilderness of Tears" film, Cheng Yanqiu will have many new singing styles and dances.

    程砚秋的“荒山泪”彩色艺术片开始拍摄
    五十二岁的著名戏剧家程砚秋，十日到北京电影制片厂的摄影场，开始拍摄他的代表作品“荒山泪”的彩色艺术片。电影制片厂的摄制人员燃放鞭炮。祝贺他从事京剧艺术生活四十二年所取得的成就。
    这部影片的导演吴祖光在摄影场里对记者说，“荒山泪”是程砚秋从1930年以来经常上演的优秀剧目。这个戏通过明代末年的故事，反映出在反动统治下人民困苦悲惨生活的情况。
    在“荒山泪”影片中，程砚秋将有许多新的唱腔和舞蹈。
