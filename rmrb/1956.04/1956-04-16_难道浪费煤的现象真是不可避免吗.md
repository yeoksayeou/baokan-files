		Is the waste of coal really unavoidable?
		To the Editor:
		The waste of coal in the Linxi, Zhaogezhuang, and Tangjiazhuang mines of the Kailuan Coal Mine is extremely serious. The gangue excavated from these mines every day contains 4% to 20% of low-quality coal, which is discarded along with the gangue. The Linxi Mine excavates about 2,000 tons of gangue every day. If the coal content is calculated at only 4%, 80 tons of coal are wasted every day, which is nearly 30,000 tons of coal wasted a year. In addition, the Linxi Mine has built five railway tracks to unload gangue since liberation. Now the gangue hill has become very high, even affecting the building area of the factory. Residents outside the north gate of this mine organized a coal picking team of 120 people, and the value of the coal they picked in 50 days reached more than 12,000 yuan. The waste of coal is also very serious in Zhaogezhuang and Tangjiazhuang mines. Because the gangue of these coal mines contains sulfur, it has already started to burn.
		Many people have repeatedly raised opinions on the waste of coal in the Kailuan Coal Mine. In April and May last year, the People's Daily and Tangshan Labor Daily also criticized it. However, the problem has not been solved. Last year, the mines organized manpower to pick coal from the gangue, but this cost too much, so it was stopped later. The Linxi Mine, fearing criticism of their "open-pit coal mine," took the approach of covering up the mistake, unloading the coal-bearing gangue in a subsidence area of more than 100 mu, preventing residents from picking it up. I hope that the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration will correct this erroneous attitude of not cherishing national property and take effective measures to reduce the coal content in the gangue.

		Investigation Report by the Readers' Letters Department of This Newspaper
		The Readers' Letters Department of this newspaper sent staff to the Kailuan Coal Mine to investigate the situation reflected by reader Wang Shukuai. The leaders of the Kailuan Coal Mine admitted that the situation was true, but they said: "We have always attached great importance to this issue and have repeatedly studied methods to deal with the coal-bearing gangue with the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tangshan Municipal People's Committee. These methods are to hoist the coal-bearing gangue onto a 300-meter-high gangue hill, unload it in a subsidence area, or organize some surplus personnel to pick coal. Besides these, what other methods are there?"
		Besides these methods that cannot completely solve the problem, is there really no other good way? No! Deputy Director Dong of Linxi Mine mentioned one thing in the conversation: In September last year, Ma Zhencang, the leader of the Tianqiao hand-picking group of Linxi Mine, developed a tool for handling semi-coal and semi-rock gangue funnels, which can reduce the coal content in the gangue. But unfortunately, after this rationalization proposal, which could eliminate waste, was put forward, the leaders of Linxi Mine had not studied it; after Ma Zhencang made several suggestions to the Linxi Mine Party Committee, the administrative leaders reluctantly expressed their adoption of the suggestion, but it has not been implemented yet.
		What are the opinions of the workers? Wu Jicai, the director of the first tunneling area of Linxi Mine, and Liu Jiasheng, Kong Xianyun, and Qin Yaosun, coal miners of the second tunneling area, all suggested that as long as we adhere to the practice of separate excavation, separate mining, and separate transportation, the coal content in the gangue can be greatly reduced. To achieve this, the standards of quota indicators should be improved, and rewards should be given not only for completing more footage but also for producing more coal. Because one of the reasons for the high coal content in the gangue is that some units only care about rushing to complete tasks and increase footage, and they excavate at one time, blasting coal and gangue together, and then pulling them out and discarding them.
		Why can a problem that can be solved not be solved for a long time? Why are the correct opinions and rationalization proposals of the workers ignored for a long time? The leaders of the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration and its affiliated mines should conduct serious inspections and further mobilize the workers to come up with solutions together, and no longer allow a large amount of coal to be discarded.

### 难道浪费煤的现象真是不可避免吗

    难道浪费煤的现象真是不可避免吗编辑同志：
    开滦煤矿林西、赵各庄、唐家庄等矿浪费煤的现象非常严重。这些矿每天开掘出来的矸石中含有4％到20％的低质煤，都同矸石一起被丢弃了。林西矿每天开掘的矸石有两千吨左右，如果含煤量只按4％计算，每天就要浪费八十吨煤，一年就要浪费近三万吨的煤。此外，林西矿为了卸矸子，在解放以后已经修了五股火车道，现在矸子山已经堆得非常高，甚至影响到厂内的建筑面积。这个矿北门外的居民组织了一个拣煤组，共有一百二十人，在五十天中拣出来的煤价值达一万二千多元。赵各庄和唐家庄矿浪费煤的现象也很严重。因为这些煤矿的矸石中含有硫黄，现在已经开始燃烧了。
    对于开滦煤矿浪费煤的现象，许多人曾多次提出过意见，去年四、五月间人民日报和唐山劳动报还曾提出过批评。但是问题始终没有解决。去年各矿虽然曾组织人力从矸石中拣煤，但是这样作花费太大，所以后来就停止了。林西矿怕报纸批评他们的“露天煤矿”，因此采取掩盖错误的作法，把含煤的矸石卸在一个面积一百多亩的塌陷区内，不让居民去拣。我希望开滦煤矿总管理处纠正这种不爱惜国家财产的错误态度，采取有效措施，减少矸石中的含煤量。

    本报读者来信部的调查报告
    读者来信部曾经派工作人员到开滦煤矿对读者王书魁反映的情况进行调查。开滦煤矿领导方面承认情况是确实的，但是他们说：“我们一直十分重视这个问题，并且屡次和中共唐山市委、唐山市人民委员会研究了处理矸石中含煤的办法。这些办法就是，把含煤的矸石绞上三百公尺高的矸子山，卸在塌陷区或者组织一部分编余人员拣煤。除此以外，还能有什么办法呢？”
    除了这些不能彻底解决问题的办法以外，难道真的没有其他好办法了吗？不！林西矿董副矿长在谈话中就曾提到了一件事情：去年九月间，林西矿天桥手选组组长马振仓研究出了一种处理半煤半岩矸子漏斗工具，可以减少矸子中的含煤量。但是很可惜，这个可能杜绝浪费现象的合理化建议提出来以后，林西矿领导方面一直没有进行研究；经过马振仓几次向林西矿党委提出意见后，行政领导方面虽然勉强表示采纳这个建议，然而直到现在还没有执行。
    工人群众的意见怎样呢？林西矿第一掘进区长吴继才、第二掘进区采煤工刘家声、孔宪运、秦耀荪等都提出，只要坚持分掘、分采、分运的做法，矸石中的含煤量就可以大大减少。要做到这一点，就应该改进定额指标的标准，不仅对多完成进尺的要奖励，对多出煤的也要奖励。因为，目前矸石中含煤量大的原因之一，是有些单位只顾赶任务，多进尺，一次掏槽，将煤和矸子混合崩出，然后一起拉出去丢掉了。
    为什么可以解决的问题长期得不到解决呢？为什么工人的正确意见和合理化建议长期被忽视呢？开滦煤矿总管理处和所属有关矿的领导方面应该认真进行检查，并且进一步发动工人群众共同想办法，不要再使大量的煤被丢弃掉。
