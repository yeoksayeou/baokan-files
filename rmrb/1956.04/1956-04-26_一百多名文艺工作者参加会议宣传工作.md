Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: The works written by Chinese writers, poets, and musicians for the National Conference of Advanced Producers have been published successively.

A total of more than one hundred literary and art workers have signed up to write for the National Conference of Advanced Producers. Among them are veteran writers such as Guo Moruo, Zang Kejia, Ye Shengtao, and Tian Han, as well as dozens of young authors who attended the National Conference of Young Literary Creators.

Veteran writers in the literary and art circles participated in this propaganda work with the greatest enthusiasm. Guo Moruo has already taken the time to visit Yue Shangwu, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, and will go to the countryside for interviews after the May Day holiday. Ye Shengtao participated in the interview work of the advanced producer representatives just after recovering from illness. He has already interviewed Su Guojin, a young technician from Jinan Alcohol General Factory, an advanced producer who is testing the production of black mold. Zang Kejia originally planned to write 20,000 words of interview notes during the conference, but now it seems that it will be greatly exceeded.

Dozens of writers and young authors have also rushed to Changchun, Anshan, Shanxi, Wuhan and other places to interview the model deeds of some advanced producers attending the National Conference of Advanced Producers.

    一百多名文艺工作者参加会议宣传工作
    据新华社25日讯  中国作家、诗人、音乐家为全国先进生产者代表会议所写的作品，已在陆续发表。
    报名为全国先进生产者代表会议写作的文学艺术工作者，共有一百多人。其中包括郭沫若、臧克家、叶圣陶、田汉等老作家，还有出席全国青年文学创作者会议的几十名青年作者。
    文艺界的老作家，用最大的热情来参加了这次宣传工作。郭沫若已经抽空访问了“毛泽东号”机车司机长岳尚武，并且要在“五一”节后下乡去作访问。叶圣陶生病刚好，就参加了先进生产者代表会议的访问工作。他已经访问了试制黑霉菌的先进生产者、济南酒精总厂的青年技术员苏国进。臧克家原来计划要在大会期间写出二万字的访问记，现在看来要大大超过了。
    几十名作家和青年作者，还分别赶到长春、鞍山、山西、武汉等地，访问出席全国先进生产者代表会议的一些先进生产者的模范事迹。
