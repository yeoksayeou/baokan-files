    Liaoning Province plans to build and expand the school buildings of ninety schools (including eighty-one newly built and nine expanded) in thirty-two cities and counties (banners) including Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Lüda, Fuxin, Fuxian, Xinjin, Kalaqin Left Banner, and Beipiao this year, with a construction area of more than 187,000 square meters. As of the end of March, twenty-four construction units had started work ahead of schedule, and other projects will also start one after another. It is expected that all projects will be completed by August, at which time more than 50,000 students will be able to study happily in the newly built school buildings.

    The newly built and expanded school buildings for higher normal schools, middle schools, and primary schools will all have classrooms with sufficient sunlight, laboratories, libraries, health rooms, and sports equipment rooms.

    The school buildings newly built and expanded this year are generally built in the middle of "residential areas" according to the distribution of the urban and rural population, so that children of residents can go to school nearby.

    辽宁将新建扩建九十所学校
    辽宁省今年将在沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、旅大、阜新、复县、新金、喀喇沁左旗、北票等三十二个市、县（旗）新建和扩建九十所学校的校舍（其中新建八十一所，扩建九所），建筑面积十八万七千多平方公尺。到三月末已有二十四个建设单位提前开工，其他工程也即陆续开工，预计到八月份可全部竣工，那时将有五万多名学生在新建的校舍里愉快地学习。
    新建和扩建的高师、中学、小学校舍都将有阳光充足的教室、实验室、图书室、保健室、体育器材室等。
    今年新建和扩建的学校校舍，是根据城乡人口分布的情况，一般的都建筑在“居民点”中间，使居民子女能够就近上学。
