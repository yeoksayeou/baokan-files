Xinhua News Agency, April 8th, Manila dispatch: According to a report in the "Manila Chronicle" on April 5th, Jose Roy, Chairman of the Philippine Economic Planning Commission and member of the House of Representatives, pointed out that the U.S. "economic aid" has not benefited the Philippines. U.S. aid returns to the U.S. through the purchase of U.S. goods.

    The Philippine House of Representatives recently instructed Roy to study the implementation of the economic agreement signed between the United States and the Philippines in 1950. He has submitted a report on the findings to the House of Representatives. The report lists facts proving that out of approximately $100 million in "aid" up to January 31, 1956, about $85 million flowed back to the United States due to the purchase of goods for projects sponsored by the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration.

    The cost of supporting U.S. technical assistance personnel consumed about $14 million of the total funds, or 14.85%, even though the agreement stipulates that the cost of support should only account for 5% of the peso counterpart fund.

    Roy also pointed out several instances where the Americans did not fulfill their obligations stipulated in the agreement: the implementation of the agreement did not "diversify the national economy by encouraging new industries" as stipulated; only 3% of the total funds were allocated to industry.

    Meanwhile, Manila Mayor Lacson said in a radio speech on April 4th: "U.S. economic aid falls far short of the debt that the United States arbitrarily and voluntarily assumed during the war, and it does not even offset the property losses we suffered in Manila alone, yet the United States dares to demand ownership, sovereignty, and jurisdiction over a portion of Philippine territory in exchange for this worthless handout."

    Lacson supports the demands of some members of Congress to re-examine the relationship between the Philippines and the United States and to revise the treaties between the two countries.

    The "Manila Chronicle" said that Philippine House of Representatives leaders unanimously emphasized the urgent need to revise the U.S.-Philippine economic agreement so that "based on our experience in its actual implementation, it conforms to the needs of the Philippines and our unbalanced economic needs."

### 美国的“经济援助”对菲律宾没有任何好处

    美国的“经济援助”对菲律宾没有任何好处
    新华社8日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”四月五日报道，菲律宾经济计划委员会主席、众议员何塞·罗伊指出，美国对菲律宾的“经济援助”并没有使菲律宾得到好处。美国的援助通过购买美国商品而重新回到了美国手中。
    菲律宾众议院最近责成罗伊研究美国和菲律宾在1950年签订的经济协定执行的情况。他已经向众议院提出了研究结果的报告。报告列举事实证明，在到1956年1月31日为止的约一亿美元“援助”中，约有八千五百万美元由于购买用于美国援外事务管理署主办的工程的商品而流回到美国手中。
    美国技术援助人员的供养费吃去了全部经费中的一千四百万美元左右，即14.85％，尽管协定中规定供养费只能占比索对等基金的5％。
    罗伊还指出了好几处美国人没有履行他们在协定中规定的义务的地方：协定的实施并没有像规定的那样“用鼓励新工业的办法来使国家的经济多样化”；经费总额中只有3％是拨给工业的。
    同时，马尼拉市长拉克森在四月四日发表的一篇广播演说中说：“美国经济援助远远抵不上美国在战时随意地、自愿地承担下的债务，而且甚至抵不上我们在马尼拉一地所遭到的财产损失，而美国竟然敢于提出对菲律宾一部分领土的所有权、主权和管辖权的要求来作为这种不值钱的布施的交换代价。”
    拉克森支持国会某些议员提出的重新审查菲律宾和美国的关系，和修改两国之间的条约的要求。
    “马尼拉纪事报”说，菲律宾众议院领袖们一致强调迫切需要修改美菲经济协定，以便“根据我们在它的实际执行中得到的经验，使它符合菲律宾的需要和我们的失调的经济需要”。
