    Bloated Management Structures
    In order to manage the relevant joint state-private stores, the Tianjin Municipal Corporations for Department Stores, Gauze, Hardware, Warehousing, etc., have established very bloated management structures. The phenomenon of overstaffing is very serious in these management organizations. The Department Store Corporation manages six industries, with a total of 1,055 stores and 3,455 staff members. Above them is a management office, eighteen main stores, and forty-six manager districts, with 913 administrative personnel. Each management person manages an average of just over three people. In the cotton cloth industry, the stores in the four districts of Xinhua, Hexi, Hebei, and Hedong have a total of 124 staff members, while the four districts have four main stores and ten manager districts, with fifty management personnel.
    The large management structure involves significant expenditure, leading to losses in industry operations. For example, the glass industry originally had a surplus of 1,313 yuan in February, but the expenditure for the sixty-seven administrative personnel in the two main stores amounted to 4,460 yuan, resulting in a loss of 3,147 yuan instead. Too many administrative personnel and too few sales staff are detrimental to accelerating commodity circulation. Therefore, the commercial departments of Tianjin Municipality should quickly study concrete measures to streamline administrative management structures in order to reduce administrative expenses, replenish sales staff, and accelerate commodity circulation.

    臃肿的管理机构
    天津市百货、纱布、五金、仓储等公司为了管理有关的公私合营商店，设立了很臃肿的管理机构，这些管理机构中人浮于事的现象很严重。百货公司所管的六个行业，共有1，055个门市部，3，455个工作人员，他们的上面设了一个管理处，十八个总店、四十六个经理区，行政管理人员就有913人，每个管理人员平均只管三个多人。棉布业在新华、河西、河北、河东四个区的门市部共有工作人员124人，而四个区就有四个总店和十个经理区，有管理人员五十人。
    管理机构庞大，开支很大，使行业经营受到亏损。例如玻璃业二月份全行业本来盈余1，313元，但是两个总店的六十七个行政管理人员的开支就要4，460元，反而赔了3，147元。行政管理人员太多，而营业人员太少，对加快商品流转是不利的。因此，天津市的商业部门应该迅速研究出精简行政管理机构的具体办法来，以减少行政费用的开支，充实营业人员，加快商品流转。
