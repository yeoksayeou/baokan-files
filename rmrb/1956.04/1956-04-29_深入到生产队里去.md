Go Deep into the Production Teams

In the current spring plowing production, the production of some agricultural cooperatives is still very chaotic. Farmers describe this phenomenon as: the top is in an uproar, the bottom is a swarm, it looks exciting, but it's done sparsely.

Recently, the Yang District Committee of the Binli County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province, in order to help agricultural cooperatives eliminate this chaotic phenomenon, went deep into the production teams of the agricultural cooperatives and, together with the leaders of the cooperatives, helped the production teams find the reasons for the production chaos. They also helped the production teams solve problems such as dividing groups, formulating seasonal and small-segment production plans, and promoting the contract system. At the same time, they also selected a group of capable poor peasant activists to replace those incompetent production team leaders. This quickly reversed the chaotic production situation.

However, there are still many rural workers currently indulging in endless meetings, endless reports, and endless old-fashioned instructions, and have not gone deep down. This situation should be changed quickly.

    深入到生产队里去
    在当前的春耕生产中，有些农业合作社的生产还很混乱。农民描写这种现象是：上面乱哄哄，下边一窝蜂，看起来带劲，干起来稀松。
    最近，中共山东省滨李县杨区区委为了帮助农业合作社消除这种混乱现象，他们深入到农业合作社的生产队，协同社的领导人员帮助生产队找出了生产混乱的原因。他们又帮助生产队解决了划分小组、制定季节和小段生产计划、推行包工制度等问题。同时还选拔了一批能干的贫农积极分子去代替那些不称职的生产队长的职务。这就很快地扭转了生产混乱的局面。
    但是，当前还有不少的农村工作人员沉醉在开不完的会议，听不完的汇报，写不完的老一套的指示里面，还没有深入下去。这种情况应该赶快改变。
