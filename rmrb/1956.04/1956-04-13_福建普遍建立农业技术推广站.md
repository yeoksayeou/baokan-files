Fujian Province has universally established agricultural technology extension stations and experimental networks. The province has recently established 367 new agricultural technology extension stations. Together with the more than one hundred stations established previously, every district in the province now has a station. By the end of March, the province had built about 300 rain gauge stations and started reporting local rainfall conditions daily by telephone and telegram.

This spring, Fujian also established several subtropical crop experimental stations and drought crop experimental stations in the south. In Fuzhou, a silkworm experimental station was established, and the Dananban State Farm was expanded into a subtropical crop trial planting farm. In order to increase the yield of more than two million mu of rotten mud paddy fields in the mountainous areas, an organization for improving rotten mud paddy fields was established in the north.

    福建普遍建立农业技术推广站
    福建省普遍建立了农业技术推广站和试验网。全省最近新建了367个农业技术推广站，连同以前建立的一百多个站，全省已经达到区区有站。至三月底，全省已经建成三百个左右的雨量站，并开始每天用电话、电报报告当地雨量情况。
    福建今春还在南部建立了几处亚热带作物试验站和干旱作物试验站。在福州市，建立了蚕桑试验站，并且将大南坂国营农场扩建为亚热带作物试种场。为了提高山区二百多万亩烂泥田产量，在北部建立了改良烂泥田的机构。　（福建日报编辑部）
