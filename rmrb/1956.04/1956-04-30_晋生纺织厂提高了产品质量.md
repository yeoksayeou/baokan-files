To the Editor:

    On January 16th, the Shanxi Daily, in its "Listen to the Consumers' Voices" column, criticized the poor quality of products from the Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory. The Party organization and administrative leaders of this factory immediately examined and criticized their complacency and the erroneous thinking of emphasizing quantity over quality. Aiming at the shortcomings of poor product quality, few designs, and unattractive styles, they launched a socialist competition among the workers with the main content of "improving quality, increasing new varieties and new designs." The entire factory formed five groups by work section and type of work, composed of veteran technicians, section chiefs, etc., to specifically lead this work. Since February, preliminary achievements have been made.

    The ten groups in the garment section conscientiously implemented the post operation rules, strengthened technical learning, and comprehensively promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet "straight-line flow production line." The rate of rework has been reduced from 50% to 28%, and the quality exceeds the target by 0.9%. The dyeing group consistently failed to meet the standards for bleaching and light colors in the past. In this competition, they promoted the advanced experience of the "water softening equipment" from the Beijing Knitting and Dyeing Factory. The bleaching quality reached 98.95%, and the first-class product rate of light-colored products such as fruit green, flesh color, and light yellow reached 99.6%. The spinning department implemented national standards, and the proportion of 6-count yarn that was raised from substandard to first-class grade 1 was 46.5%, and the first-class grade 1 product of 21-count yarn reached 100%. In addition, the phenomenon of chaotic finished product packaging has also been basically overcome.

    The factory's employees also successfully trial-produced thirty-six new varieties and new designs of products based on consumer feedback. Veteran technician Zhang Tingfu and technician Zhang Tingxi studied together based on mass opinions and produced nine new products such as "high-top men's and women's plain-pattern socks," "vertical striped women's patterned socks," and "18-inch children's socks." Li Yunting and Shen Bingjun of the garment section conducted in-depth market visits and improved the styles of various garments according to consumer opinions. These new products are generally beautiful and durable, and have been welcomed by the masses.

    The factory's employees are not complacent about the above achievements. They are determined to continue learning advanced experience, improve technology, further improve product quality, and produce more new products to meet the needs of the vast number of consumers.

    晋生纺织厂提高了产品质量编辑同志：
    一月十六日山西日报在“听听消费者的声音”栏内，批评了太原晋生纺织厂产品质量不好的情况。这个厂的党组织和行政领导马上检查和批判了骄傲自满情绪和重量轻质的错误思想，并且针对产品质量差，花样少，样式不美观的缺点，发动职工群众开展了以“提高质量、增加新品种和新花样”为主要内容的社会主义竞赛。全厂按工段、工种以老技术工人、工段长等组成了五个小组，专门来领导这项工作。从二月份以来，已经取得了初步的成绩。
    成衣工段十个小组认真贯彻了岗位操作规程，加强了技术学习，全面推广了苏联“直线流水生产线”的先进经验，返工品已经由50％降低到28％，质量超过指标零点九。染色小组过去漂白、轻色工作一贯达不到指标，在这次竞赛中推行了北京机织印染厂“软化水设备”的先进经验，漂白质量达到了98.95％，印染轻色的果绿、肉色、嫩黄等产品的正品率达到了99.6％。纺纱部贯彻了国家标准，六支纱由等外品提高到一等一级的有46.5％，二十一支纱的一等一级品达到了100％。此外，成品包装混乱的现象也基本上克服了。
    这个厂的职工们还根据消费者的意见，试制成功了三十六种新品种和新花样的产品。老技术工人张亭福和技术员张廷秀根据群众意见，共同研究，生产出了“高统男女平花袜”、“立条女花袜”、“十八长童袜”等九种新产品；成衣工段李云廷和申丙俊深入市场进行访问，按照消费者的意见，改进了多种衣服样式。这些新产品，一般都是美观耐用，受到了群众的欢迎。
    这个厂的职工们并不因为以上这些成绩而感到自满。他们还决心继续学习先进经验，改进技术，进一步提高产品质量，生产出更多的新产品，以满足广大消费者的需要。
