Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 12th. The Harbin Intermediate People's Court and the Harbin People's Procuratorate held a mass rally on the 4th, attended by more than 70,000 people, to announce the lenient treatment of ten counter-revolutionaries who had surrendered and confessed.

    The Intermediate People's Court announced on the spot that six counter-revolutionaries who had committed more serious crimes but had confessed and repented, and had performed meritorious service to atone for their crimes, would be exempted from criminal punishment or have their sentences reduced in accordance with the law. The People's Procuratorate announced on the spot that four counter-revolutionaries who had repented and performed meritorious service to atone for their crimes would not be prosecuted. Among them, the counter-revolutionary Fu Yuwen served as a puppet police officer and puppet soldier during the puppet Manchukuo regime, and was loyal to the Japanese invaders for many years. After liberation, he joined Chiang Kai-shek's secret army organization as a major regimental commander, actively expanding Chiang Kai-shek's influence and plotting rebellion. Later, he colluded with bandits to commit highway robbery. However, recently, moved by the government's lenient policy, he had remorse and confessed to the public security organs, confessing his past counter-revolutionary criminal activities. The People's Court, based on his confirmed repentance, announced at the meeting that he would be exempted from criminal punishment.

    The counter-revolutionary Fu Yunxing had been serving as the director of the Judicial Section of the Puppet Manchukuo Police Department since 1933, frequently arresting innocent people, torturing them to extract confessions, and participating in the special agent organization of the Puppet Police Department to arrest cadres of the anti-Japanese democratic government. His crimes were relatively serious and he should have been punished, but after education, in addition to actively confessing his personal crimes, he also exposed and reported his accomplices. The People's Court decided to treat him leniently and exempt him from criminal punishment.

    The counter-revolutionary Sun Kexue joined the Harbin Second Group of the Military Intelligence Bureau's Changchun Station in February 1946 and developed an agent for this intelligence organization, collecting military, political, and economic intelligence about the Liberated Areas. After the founding of New China, he intensified his efforts to collect important military intelligence such as the number and equipment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, reported it to the enemy, and infiltrated the People's Government to conceal his crimes for a long time. However, during the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, he thoroughly confessed his crimes and reported the counter-revolutionaries he knew. Based on his repentance, the People's Procuratorate decided not to prosecute him and also suggested that his original unit allow him to continue working.

    The counter-revolutionary Qu Jinru joined the direct intelligence team of a certain army of the Chiang army in 1946 as the intelligence director, directly leading and dispatching 40 to 50 intelligence agents to the Liberated Areas to collect various military intelligence of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, at least dozens of copies every day, and more than 100 copies at most. In September 1947, she disguised herself as an old woman by taking medicine and applying medicine to her face, and sneaked into Jilin and Xiaofengman, areas where the Chinese People's Liberation Army was stationed, to spy on important intelligence such as the types of arms, troop numbers, and weapons and ammunition, and was rewarded by the enemy and promoted to lieutenant intelligence director. This time, in the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, she recognized her way out, thoroughly confessed all her crimes, and reported dozens of pieces of materials of other counter-revolutionaries. Based on her surrender and confession, and her reporting of counter-revolutionaries, the People's Procuratorate decided to treat her leniently and not to prosecute her.

    哈尔滨宽大处理自首的反革命分子
    新华社哈尔滨12日电　哈尔滨市中级人民法院和哈尔滨市人民检察院在四日举行七万多人参加的群众大会，宣布宽大处理十名自首坦白的反革命分子。
    中级人民法院对六名罪行较重，但已经认罪悔过，并且有立功赎罪表现的反革命分子，当场宣布依法免予刑事处分或减轻处分。人民检察院对四名悔过自新，立功赎罪的反革命分子，当场宣布不予起诉。其中反革命分子付毓文，在伪满时充当伪警、伪军，效忠日寇多年。解放后，又参加了蒋介石的秘密建军组织，任少校团长，并积极为蒋介石扩张势力，阴谋策动叛乱。后来又勾结土匪进行路劫。但最近在政府宽大政策的感召下有了悔悟，向公安机关坦白自首，交代了自己过去的反革命罪恶活动。人民法院根据他确有悔过的表现，在会上宣布免予刑事处分。
    反革命分子甫运兴从1933年起，就开始担任伪满警察署司法科主任等职务，经常抓捕无辜群众，进行刑讯逼供，并且参与伪警察署特务组织，抓捕抗日民主政府的干部，罪行较大，本应给予惩办，但他经过教育后，除主动地交代了个人犯罪事实外，并且揭发检举了同伙。人民法院决定对他宽大处理，免予刑事处分。
    反革命分子孙可学在1946年2月参加了军统局长春站哈尔滨第二组特务组织，并且为这个特务组织发展了一名特务，搜集有关解放区的军事、政治、经济情报。新中国成立以后，他更加加紧收集中国人民解放军的人数、装备等重要军事情报，向敌人汇报，并且混入人民政府工作，长期隐瞒自己的罪行，但在肃清反革命分子运动中，他彻底坦白了自己的罪行，并且检举了他所知道的反革命分子。人民检察院根据他的悔过表现，决定不予起诉，还建议原单位让他继续工作。
    反革命分子曲金茹，在1946年参加了蒋军某军直属谍报队为情报主任，直接领导和派遣四、五十名谍报队员到解放区搜集中国人民解放军各种军事情报，每日至少有几十份，多则一百多份。1947年9月，她以吃药和向脸上擦药的方法，化妆成老太婆，潜入中国人民解放军驻区吉林和小丰满等地，刺探兵种、部队番号、武器弹药等重要情报，从而受到敌人的奖励，并且晋级为中尉情报主任。这次在肃清反革命分子运动中，她认清了自己的出路，彻底坦白了全部罪恶，并检举了其他反革命分子的材料数十件。根据她自首坦白，检举反革命分子的表现，人民检察院决定从宽处理，不予起诉。
