Promote the Advanced Producer Movement

    Five Initiatives
    By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin
    In October 1955, Dai Libin, the leader of the masonry youth shock brigade of the Third Engineering Company of the Central-South Construction Engineering Bureau, participated in the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference. After returning, he hurried to the construction site. In order to welcome the Hubei Province and the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, their masonry youth shock brigade proposed promoting advanced bricklaying experiences such as interior scaffolding and the Maletsev shovel, achieving an average of 1,400 bricks per worker for 25 single-sided clear water walls and 1,900 bricks per worker for mixed water walls. Dai Libin was eager to know if this suggestion had been implemented.
    The team members' response disappointed Dai Libin: the initiative had not been realized and had only reached about 70% of the proposed targets.
    The initiative had been put forward for nearly a month, but why had it not been realized? Dai Libin felt distressed.
    Initiatives are a force for promoting production surges. How can production be pushed to new heights if the initiative cannot be realized? How can we lead others forward? How can we live up to the honorary title of "shock brigade"? A series of questions swirled in Dai Libin's mind. He felt that the initiative must be realized quickly. Since everyone else couldn't achieve it, then he should be the first to do so: create results to motivate everyone.
    From the next day, Dai Libin arrived at the construction site before work hours and started working alone. After work, he was still the only one working overtime. He believed that such selfless labor would definitely improve work efficiency and realize the initiative.
    However, despite Dai Libin's strenuous efforts for several days, he still did not achieve the initiative.
    This made him very sad, and what made him even sadder was that he discovered that the team members' morale was beginning to dissipate: some people did not believe that promoting advanced experiences such as bricklaying with interior scaffolding could improve work efficiency and complained that the targets of the initiative were too high; some people believed that whether the initiative was realized or not was irrelevant to them, as long as they received their basic salary; some people were in low spirits due to family economic difficulties; some people even transferred their dissatisfaction to Dai Libin. Dai Libin also felt that the realization of the initiative was somewhat bleak.
    One day, the secretary of the Party Committee of the Third Engineering Company came to the construction site and said to Dai Libin: "The reason why your initiative cannot be realized for a long time is primarily because the leadership's support and assistance are insufficient. In the future, the leadership will definitely vigorously support you in realizing the initiative; however, realizing the initiative must also have a mass base. Judging from the current situation, your mass base is still weak." Finally, the Party Committee Secretary warmly and kindly told Dai Libin: the initiative was put forward by everyone and must be realized by relying on the Party organization and the masses.
    These words warmed Dai Libin's heart. Yes! The initiative was put forward by everyone and must be realized by relying on the Party organization and the masses. What had he been doing? After hearing that the initiative had not been realized, he didn't discuss the reasons why it couldn't be realized and find solutions with the team members, nor did he have good discussions within the Party; he just worried alone: he just worked hard from morning till night. How could this work?
    The next day, a Party group meeting was held to discuss the issue of realizing the initiative. Dai Libin sincerely examined his detachment from the masses during this period in leading everyone to realize the initiative. Then, they studied the reasons why the initiative could not be realized and decided to first conduct ideological work among the team members separately.
    Dai Libin took the lead in implementing the Party's resolution. Every day after work, he often talked with the team members. He explained the important significance of realizing the initiative to those who did not care about its realization; he analyzed the huge production potential of the team to those who complained that the targets of the initiative were too high; he humbly listened to the team members' criticisms of himself, and he also tried his best to help team members overcome specific difficulties. When Lei Peng was sick in the hospital, he went to see him himself and also mobilized the team members to visit him.
    The team's ideology was clarified, and now the problem was to overcome technical difficulties. At this time, advanced technician Master Luo was dispatched to specifically explain the theory of advanced technology such as bricklaying with interior scaffolding and the superiority of using advanced tools such as the Maletsev shovel to the team members, and foreman Zhou Baoji was assigned to specifically guide the team members in operation. The team members all improved their confidence in realizing the initiative, actively learned operational techniques, and proposed rationalization suggestions such as adjusting labor organization and eliminating idling. The whole team launched a labor competition.
    In late October, the shock brigade exceeded the initiative on the premise of ensuring quality: the 25 single-sided clear water walls averaged 1,560 bricks per worker, the mixed water walls averaged 2,220 bricks per worker, exceeding the state-stipulated labor quota by 30%, reducing the loss rate of bricks, sand, and cement, and also saving timber.
    The realization of the masonry youth shock brigade's initiative had a great impact in various basic construction units in Hubei Province. Driven by the news of the masonry youth shock brigade's successful realization of the initiative, more than 20 shock brigades launched competitions, and more than 30 production groups were also brewing proposals for initiatives. The masonry youth shock brigade's initiative has become a force for mobilizing the broad masses to push production to new heights. Dai Libin and all the team members were as excited about this matter, but he also thought: the realization of the initiative is promoting others forward, and he cannot stop moving forward; he should continue to move forward!
    Could he take another step forward? He felt it was entirely possible. Currently, the use of advanced tools such as interior scaffolding and the Maletsev shovel is not yet fully skilled, some people have not yet reached the quota, and the supply of bricks and mortar by the auxiliary workers is not very well coordinated. But their initiative has also been realized. If the operational skills are further improved, so that the backward catch up with the advanced level, and the coordination problems of the auxiliary workers are seriously resolved, then, can't the team's production be further improved?
    Dai Libin's analysis encouraged the morale of the entire team, and some people who had been satisfied with the status quo also examined their conservative thinking. After full deliberation, the masonry youth shock brigade proposed a second initiative: 25 single-sided clear water walls averaged 1,650 bricks per worker, and mixed water walls averaged 2,300 bricks per worker.
    The second initiative was originally planned to be realized in one month. Due to the in-depth development of the labor competition, the team members generally became familiar with operational techniques with the help of technicians, and actively helped auxiliary workers overcome difficulties in transporting bricks and mortar, improving efficiency. The initiative was exceeded in less than half a month: the 25 single-sided clear water walls averaged 1,750 bricks per worker, the mixed water walls averaged 2,550 bricks per worker, and the project quality fully met the standards.
    A few days later, Dai Libin saw the news in the newspaper that the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge would be completed one year ahead of schedule, and he was very excited. He thought: The workers building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are constructing on the turbulent waters, which is much more arduous than constructing on land, but they also proposed to complete the project one year ahead of schedule, so why can't we further improve production? He mobilized the team members to discuss this issue. Everyone believed that it was still possible to further improve production. They put forward many rationalization suggestions such as adjusting labor organization and saving man-hours, and actively learned the advanced experiences of Zhang Daluo of the First Engineering Company in improving lightweight mortar spreaders. Based on these measures, the masonry youth shock brigade successively proposed and realized the third and fourth initiatives. Under the requirement of ensuring quality, the 25 single-sided clear water walls averaged 2,300 bricks per worker, and the mixed water walls averaged 3,200 bricks per worker, exceeding the central government's stipulated labor quota by 83%.
    Not long ago, Chongqing youth bricklayer Yang Changshi laid 3,250 bricks for 25 single-sided clear water walls. Dai Libin compared this indicator with the indicator of his own team and found that his team's indicator was still far from the advanced level. He actively studied technology and, with the assistance of technical instructor Huang Junfu and others, created a double-sided mortar spreading ruler. According to experiments, using this advanced tool, 3,400 bricks can be laid for 25 single-sided clear water walls and 4,000 bricks can be laid for mixed water walls, exceeding the central government's stipulated labor quota by 155%, and it can ensure quality and save mortar. This matter gave the team members great encouragement, and they decided that Dai Libin would represent all the team members and propose a fifth initiative based on the 3,400-brick laying target.
    People can believe that this masonry youth shock brigade, which is always constantly demanding itself with more advanced levels, will strive to realize the fifth initiative as it has done in the past, and it can be foreseen that they will have a sixth initiative, a seventh initiative...

    五次倡议
    本报记者  古维进
    1955年10月，中南建筑工程总局第三工程公司泥工青年突击队队长戴礼彬，参加了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。他回来以后，就匆匆忙忙朝工地走去。他们的泥工青年突击队，为了迎接湖北省和全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，提出了推广内脚手架和马列采夫锹等砌砖先进经验，使二十五单面清水墙平均每工砌砖一千四百块，混水墙平均每工砌砖一千九百块的倡议。戴礼彬急于想了解这个建议实现没有。
    队员们的回答使戴礼彬失望了：倡议还没有实现，而且才达到倡议指标的70％左右。
    倡议提出来快一个月了，为什么还实现不了呢？戴礼彬感到苦恼。
    倡议，这是推动生产高涨的力量，如果不能实现倡议，怎么把生产推向高涨呢？怎么带动别人前进呢？怎么对得起“突击队”这个荣誉的称号呢？一连串的问题在戴礼彬的脑子里打转。他觉得必须赶快实现倡议，既然大家都实现不了，那就自己首先去实现吧：作出成绩，推动大家。
    从第二天开始，不到上班时间，戴礼彬就来到工地，一个人干开了，下班以后，还是他一个人在工地加班。他相信这样忘我地劳动，一定可以提高工效，实现倡议。
    但是，戴礼彬紧张干了好几天活，还是没有实现倡议。
    这使他非常难过，而最使他难过的还是发现队员们的思想开始涣散了：有些人不相信推广内脚手架砌砖等先进经验能提高工效，埋怨倡议的指标太高；有些人认为倡议实现不实现和自己无关，能拿到基本工资就行了；有些人因家庭经济困难、情绪不高；有些人甚至把不满情绪转移到戴礼彬身上，戴礼彬也觉得倡议的实现有点渺茫。
    一天，第三工程公司党委会的书记来到工地，对戴礼彬说：“你们的倡议长时期不能实现，首先是领导上的支持和帮助不够。今后领导上一定大力支持你们实现倡议；不过实现倡议还必须有群众基础，从目前情况来看，你们的群众基础还是薄弱的啊。”末了，党委书记热情而亲切地告诉戴礼彬：倡议是大伙提出来的，必须依靠党组织，依靠群众去实现。
    这些话叫戴礼彬心里热呼呼的，是啊！倡议是大伙提出来的，必须依靠党组织，依靠群众去实现。自己是怎样做的呢？回到工地，听说倡议没有实现，也不同队员一块研究倡议不能实现的原因，找出实现的办法，也不在党内好好的讨论，只是一个人闷在肚子里着急：只是一个人起早贪黑地干活。这怎么行呢？
    第二天，开了党小组会议，讨论实现倡议的问题。戴礼彬诚恳地检查了这一期间在领导大伙实现倡议中脱离群众的现象，接着，他们研究了倡议不能实现的原因，决定首先分头向队员进行思想工作。
    戴礼彬带头执行了党的决议。每天下班以后，他经常和队员们在一起谈心。给那些不关心倡议实现的人说明实现倡议的重要意义；给那些埋怨倡议指标太高的人分析队里还有巨大的生产潜力；虚心听取队员们对自己的批评，他还尽力帮助队员克服具体困难。雷鹏病在医院里，他自己去看他，还发动队员去慰问。
    全队的思想澄清了，现在的问题是克服技术上的困难。这时派了先进技工罗师傅专门给队员讲解内脚手架砌砖这一先进技术的理论，和使用马列采夫锹等先进工具的优越性，责成工长周保记具体指导队员操作。队员都提高了实现倡议的信心，他们积极学习操作技术，提出调整劳动组织，消灭窝工现象等合理化建议。全队开展了劳动竞赛。
    十月下旬，突击队在保证质量的前提下，超额实现了倡议：25单面清水墙平均每工砌到1，560块，混水墙平均每工砌到2，220块，超过国家规定的劳动定额30％，降低了砖、沙、水泥的损耗率，还节约了木料。
    泥工青年突击队的倡议实现了，在湖北省各个基本建设单位里发生很大的影响。二十多个突击队在泥工青年突击队实现倡议的捷报推动下，掀起了竞赛，有三十多个生产小组也在酝酿提出倡议。泥工青年突击队的倡议已经成为动员广大群众把生产推向新高涨的一种力量。戴礼彬和全体队员一样为这件事情兴奋，但是他又想到：倡议的实现正在推动别人前进，自己不能停止不前，应该继续前进呀！
    能不能再前进一步？他觉得是完全可能的。现在，使用内脚手架和马列采夫锹等先进工具操作还没有完全熟练，有些人还达不到定额，辅工的砖灰供应也不是配合得很好的。可是他们的倡议也实现了。如果进一步把操作技术熟练起来，让落后的都赶上先进水平，认真解决辅助工的配合问题，那么，队里的生产不是还可以提高吗？
    戴礼彬的分析鼓舞了全队的情绪，有些曾经满足现状的人也检查了自己的保守思想。经过充分酝酿，泥工青年突击队提出了第二次倡议：25单面清水墙平均每工砌到1，650块，混水墙平均每工砌到2，300块。
    第二次倡议原来计划一个月实现，由于深入开展了劳动竞赛，队员们在技术人员的帮助下普遍熟悉了操作技术，并且主动帮助辅工克服砖、灰运输的困难，提高了效率，不到半个月就超额实现了倡议：25单面清水墙平均每工砌到1，750块，混水墙平均每工砌到2，550块，工程质量完全达到标准。
    几天后，戴礼彬从报纸上看到武汉长江大桥将提前一年建成的消息，心里非常激动。他想：建设武汉长江大桥的职工们是在波涛滚滚的水上施工的，比起在陆地上施工不知要艰苦多少倍，可是他们还提出要提前一年完工，那么我们为什么就不能再进一步的提高生产呢？他发动队员们讨论了这个问题。大家认为进一步提高生产还是可能的。他们提出了调整劳动组织、节省工时等许多合理化建议，并且积极学习第一工程公司张大罗改进轻便铺灰器等先进经验。根据这些措施，泥工青年突击队连续提出和实现了第三次和第四次倡议，在保证质量的要求下，25单面清水墙平均每工砌到2，300块，混水墙平均每工砌到3，200块，超过中央规定的劳动定额83％。
    不久以前，重庆青年瓦工杨长诗砌25单面清水墙达到3，250块。戴礼彬把这个指标和自己队里的指标一比，发现自己队里的指标距离先进水平还差得很远。他就积极钻研技术，在技术指导员黄俊福等协助下，创造了双面推灰尺，根据试验，使用这个先进工具，25单面清水墙可以砌到3，400块，混水墙可以砌到4，000块，超过中央规定的劳动定额155％，并且可以保证质量，节约灰浆。这件事情，给了队员们很大的鼓舞，他们决定由戴礼彬代表全体队员，根据3，400块的砌砖指标，提出第五次倡议。
    人们可以相信：总是不断地以更先进的水平要求自己的这支泥工青年突击队，会像过去一样努力地实现第五次倡议，并且可以预见他们将会有第六次倡议、第七次倡议……（附图片）
    戴礼彬正在执行他们的第四次倡议，争取提前完成第一季度计划。
