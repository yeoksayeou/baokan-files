The socialist revolution is surging forward in China's countryside. Over 90% of farm households nationwide have joined agricultural production cooperatives. Some provinces and cities have basically achieved advanced forms of cooperation, and the transition from elementary to advanced cooperatives has become the mainstream of the movement. Rural relations of production have undergone fundamental changes.

The great and fundamental change in the countryside has promoted a high tide in agricultural production. The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) proposed by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has further encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers. After farmers organized, especially into advanced cooperatives, labor productivity and labor utilization rates have been greatly enhanced. Last winter, the achievements in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and other preparatory work for spring plowing surpassed any previous year. With last year's bumper harvests of grain and cotton, agricultural production cooperatives have significantly increased their ability to invest in reproduction, actively adding production materials and expanding reproduction. At the same time, the state's financial, economic, and technical support for agricultural production cooperatives will be greatly increased this year. These factors are very beneficial for completing the 1956 agricultural production tasks. However, on the other hand, due to the rapid development and large scale of the agricultural cooperation movement, many agricultural production cooperatives have not had time to properly handle issues such as the entry of means of production into the cooperatives, labor organization, and production plans after they were established or transitioned to advanced cooperatives. There are also many cooperatives that are experiencing wasted labor, chaotic management, unclear responsibilities, excessive non-productive expenditures, and extravagance. If these problems are not resolved in a timely manner, they will inevitably have an adverse impact on production.

1956 is the first year that the cooperative economy will occupy a dominant position in the agricultural economy, and it is also the first year for implementing the National Agricultural Development Program. Striving for an even greater bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1956, and striving to complete the agricultural development plan of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target in 1956, is of great significance. To this end, the State Council hereby issues the following instructions regarding the current spring plowing production work:

(1)	The spring plowing season has arrived. The current task is to shift the focus of rural work to leading spring plowing production, further mobilizing the socialist enthusiasm of the masses, and launching a large-scale spring plowing production campaign. All cooperatives that are currently being established, expanded, merged, or upgraded should quickly complete this work and promptly switch to production. Cooperatives that are not being expanded, merged, or upgraded should not be changed before spring plowing. In conjunction with spring plowing production, all established cooperatives should be rectified and consolidated. Problems left over from the establishment, expansion, merger, or upgrade process should be handled properly and promptly. Problems that cannot be resolved before spring plowing and do not have a significant impact on production can be explained to the members first and then addressed after spring plowing is completed.

(2)	Individual farmers are responsible for arranging their own production, while cooperative members rely on the cooperative to arrange their production. Therefore, doing a good job in the operation and management of agricultural production cooperatives is of paramount importance. Agricultural production cooperatives should carry out production in a planned manner. During the spring plowing period, a spring operation plan must be formulated, with spring plowing and sowing as the center, and all production activities should be arranged accordingly. Leadership organs at all levels, especially at the county and district levels, must immediately organize forces to go deep into the countryside to check the production plans of the cooperatives, help the cooperatives formulate plans that are realistic, both active and reliable, and help the cooperatives organize production teams, divide cultivation areas, formulate labor quotas, promote the contracting system, and organize spring plowing production activities according to plan.

Strengthen guidance to cooperative accountants, help cooperatives establish financial management systems, and conscientiously implement the principle of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily." Currently, some cooperatives, after merging, expanding, and transitioning to advanced cooperatives, have prematurely started merging villages, building new houses, installing electric lights, building roads, purchasing excessive cultural and recreational supplies and production materials that are not currently needed, and engaging in large-scale non-productive capital construction, resulting in excessive expenditures and wasting the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the cooperatives, causing concern and dissatisfaction among the members. This phenomenon of extravagance is extremely detrimental to the consolidation and development of cooperatives and must be quickly overcome.

(3)	Do all the preparatory work to ensure timely sowing and transplanting without missing the agricultural season. Comprehensively complete the spring sowing tasks according to the state plan. The sowing plans for grain, cotton, soybeans, and other oil crops must be guaranteed. No neglect should be given to increasing the production of various crops, breeding livestock, and increasing livestock products. It is right to attach importance to grain and cotton, but it is wrong to neglect other crops. In 1955, there were bumper harvests of grain and cotton, but many cash crops and livestock failed to meet their development plans. This one-sidedness in the implementation of the plan must be corrected. The development of national industrialization and the improvement of people's lives require that various agricultural products grow proportionally and correspondingly. Any one-sidedness in leading production will have an adverse impact on the balanced development of the national economy.

(4)	During the spring plowing period, under the conditions of available labor, the superiority of cooperation should be fully utilized to organize appropriate labor to build small-scale water conservancy projects and strive to complete the plan to expand the irrigation area. In particular, technical guidance should be strengthened to ensure the quality of the projects and overcome shortcomings such as simply pursuing quantity without regard to quality and neglecting construction safety measures. In order to prevent spring drought, all localities should conduct a general inspection of the completed irrigation projects, carry out necessary reinforcement and repairs, and fully prepare various water lifting tools. Under the conditions that the supply of new-style tools is insufficient, all localities must actively organize handicrafts to produce and repair old-style water lifting tools to avoid being caught off guard in the event of a drought. In order to give full play to the benefits of irrigation facilities, the management system of water use should be improved, water conservancy organizations should be strengthened, the masses should be educated to improve irrigation techniques, and irrigation methods such as ditch irrigation, furrow irrigation, and water storage and moisture conservation should be promoted in dryland areas, and shallow irrigation and frequent irrigation should be promoted in rice areas.

(5)	Continue to carry out the fertilizer accumulation campaign, use all possible sources of fertilizer to increase fertilizer accumulation, intensify the cultivation of green manure, increase the yield of green manure crops, raise more pigs, accumulate more fertilizer, and ensure that all crops have sufficient fertilizer. Agricultural production cooperatives should establish a perennial fertilizer accumulation system. In addition to organizing members to engage in the common labor of composting and fertilizer production, they should also organize member families to accumulate fertilizer and hand it over to the cooperative for use, and adopt the method of grading according to quality and reasonably remunerating to encourage their enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation. In some places, a lot of fertilizer has been accumulated, but most of it has not been sent to the fields. Sufficient force must be immediately organized to quickly complete the work of sending fertilizer to avoid delaying spring plowing. Improve fertilization methods, actively promote the experiences of applying topdressing in stages and mixed fertilization, and change from spreading fertilizer to concentrated fertilization to improve fertilizer efficiency. Although the quantity of chemical fertilizers, cake fertilizers, and bacterial fertilizers has increased compared with last year, the supply still falls short of demand. It is required that all localities allocate them reasonably under the principle of giving priority to supplying industrial raw material crop areas and high-yield grain crop areas. All localities should actively develop granular fertilizer manufacturing plants as much as possible and make full use of urban fertilizer sources.

(6)	Agricultural departments and agricultural technology extension stations at all levels should promptly check the seed preparation of agricultural production cooperatives and cooperate with grain departments to help them solve the difficulties of seed shortage. When agricultural and grain departments transport and supply seeds, they should explain the variety characteristics and cultivation techniques to the farmers, and strictly conduct inspections to ensure that the germination rate meets the standards and avoid the spread of dangerous diseases and pests. Agricultural departments in each province and county should establish and improve seed institutions within a specified time limit according to local conditions, and select key points below the county level to quickly establish seed stations that manage improved varieties. Strengthen the work of seed management and promotion of improved varieties. State-owned farms should become breeding bases for improved varieties, and agricultural production cooperatives should also establish their own seed plots, train technicians to manage seeds, and strive to achieve the promotion plan for improved varieties. For perennial crops such as tea, mulberry, and fruit trees, preparations should be made in advance for the next year in terms of seed selection and seedling cultivation in accordance with the development plan.

(7)	The promotion of new-style agricultural implements such as double-wheeled double-shared plows is a detailed and complex task. This year, the demand for new-style agricultural implements is very large, but the raw materials are insufficient and the manufacturing cannot keep up, especially the supply in the first quarter cannot meet the needs of spring plowing. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to resolutely prevent shoddy manufacturing, ensure the specifications and quality of the products; it is necessary to properly arrange the order of supply according to the early and late spring plowing seasons in various places, and strive to supply more new-style agricultural implements to farmers in time before spring plowing; it is necessary to conscientiously do a good job in technical training and ensure that farmers are taught how to use them; it is necessary to organize repair work well, prepare spare parts, and ensure that spare parts are available where they are missing and repairs are available where they are broken. Only in this way can the yield-increasing effect of new-style agricultural implements be truly brought into play, so as to avoid farmers buying them back and not knowing how to use them, not being able to repair them when they break down, and leaving them idle, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Now, some places have run out of double-wheeled double-shared plows, while other places have stockpiles. Agricultural, supply and marketing cooperatives, and mechanical industry departments at all levels are responsible for earnestly checking the quality of new-style agricultural implements produced by various factories and readjusting the supply plan. All localities should also actively organize handicraft production cooperatives to manufacture and repair old-style agricultural implements to make up for the shortage of new-style agricultural implements.

Tractor stations must further improve the quality of operations, give full play to the efficiency of machines, reduce operating costs, and continuously increase the unit output of mechanically cultivated land, so as to reverse the phenomenon of annual losses of tractor stations and continuously increase the income of the agricultural production cooperatives they serve.

(8)	Last winter, the temperature was higher, which was conducive to overwintering diseases and insects. Areas where the prevention and control of overwintering diseases and insects were not thorough enough must immediately make up for the lessons. In spring plowing, seed treatment (seed dressing with agents and seed soaking, etc.) should be strengthened, disease-free seedlings should be cultivated, and attention should be paid to preventing and controlling underground pests to ensure full seedlings. Strengthen forecasting and early warning, grasp the occurrence of diseases and insects in a timely manner, and guide the masses in prevention and control. Conscientiously do a good job in the storage of pesticides and agricultural machinery, pesticides should be properly stored to prevent changes and failures, and agricultural machinery should also be inspected and repaired in a timely manner.

(9)	Vigorously protect and breed livestock. Spring is the breeding season for livestock, and all localities must seize the opportunity to do a good job in breeding and protect pregnant livestock. Actively help agricultural production cooperatives establish a rational system for raising and using draught animals to facilitate the protection and breeding of draught animals. Supply and marketing cooperatives should strive to do a good job in adjusting draught animals to meet the needs of farmers' spring plowing livestock power. Some pastoral areas suffered drought last winter, and there was heavy snow this spring. It is necessary to immediately check the overwintering and spring crossing of livestock, transfer pastures in a timely manner, and do a good job in lambing and lamb protection.

Various animal epidemics often prevail in spring. All localities must actively organize forces, mobilize the masses, prepare medicines, and strengthen preventive injections; areas where epidemics have occurred should immediately take effective measures, actively treat them, and prevent the spread of epidemics.

(10)	In some local areas, there were water and drought disasters last year, and there are currently greater difficulties in production. Agricultural production cooperatives in disaster areas should give full play to collective strength, help each other, and adopt various methods to carry out self-salvation through production. The state should also do a good job in supplying production materials in disaster areas, and use methods such as loans, relief, and work-for-relief to help farmers in disaster areas tide over the spring famine and carry out spring plowing production smoothly. When organizing farmers in disaster areas to carry out spring plowing production, in addition to planting more early-maturing crops, it is also necessary to pay attention to organizing them to engage in sideline production that has immediate income, otherwise it will increase the difficulty of their current lives, which is also unfavorable to production.

In the sowing season last autumn and winter, some places affected the normal development of wheat seedlings, rape and other overwintering crops due to water and drought imbalances. Now, we must seize the opportunity to do a good job in field management and strive for bumper harvests of wheat and rapeseed.

(11)	The 1956 land reclamation plan is larger than any previous year. The key provinces and regions for land reclamation must seize the time to reclaim more wasteland before the sowing season and increase the area of land cultivated in the current year. To this end, it is necessary to do a corresponding good job in immigration work. Other provinces and regions should also, according to local conditions, reclaim scattered, small-scale cultivable wasteland in a planned manner, while ensuring that water and soil conservation are not damaged.

(12)	Plant trees and make forests, and vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work. All areas with severe soil erosion should combine soil and water conservation measures to implement the comprehensive management of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to control soil erosion and conserve water sources. Under the slogan of greening, the tree planting and afforestation movement has been universally launched, and there is a shortage of seedlings everywhere. To this end, forestry departments must develop nurseries and help agricultural production cooperatives with larger tree planting plans establish nurseries in a planned manner to solve the needs for seedlings in the future. Afforestation must strictly pay attention to quality and guarantee planting and survival. During the spring plowing period, we must also pay attention to forest fire prevention, especially in areas where there is a habit of burning mountains for cultivation and burning mountains for fertilizer, it is necessary to strictly prevent forest fires.

(13)	The amount of agricultural loans planned to be issued by the state this year is very large, about 1.5 billion yuan more than last year's target. All localities must be good at using this huge economic force to promote the development of agricultural production. However, some places have not done a good job in agricultural loans. Some of them have not issued agricultural loans fairly and reasonably. Those who should not be lent have been lent, and those who should be lent have not been lent; some of them have lent too much, and the review is not strict, which has promoted the extravagance of agricultural production cooperatives; others have a large amount of loans piled up in banks and not lent out. Leadership organs at all levels are responsible for organizing the strength of the Agricultural Bank and other relevant departments to conduct a thorough inspection of agricultural loans, and correctly and timely issue agricultural loans to give full play to the due role of agricultural loans in supporting agricultural production.

(14)	Leadership organs at all levels, especially agricultural departments, are required to go deep into the countryside, summarize the advanced production experience of the masses, and actively promote them in accordance with local conditions. Train and cultivate agricultural technicians of agricultural cooperatives in large quantities and in a planned manner, hold labor model meetings and agricultural exhibitions well, organize labor models to impart advanced experience, organize large-scale high-yield demonstrations and visits and evaluations, and make the advanced experience of one cooperative and one place become everyone's production practice. And widely organize mass socialist labor competitions, exchange experiences with each other, help each other, promote the advanced, overcome the backward, and make the socialist labor competition an actual driving force for completing the 1956 agricultural production increase plan.

    国务院关于春耕生产的指示
    在我国农村中，社会主义革命的高潮正在汹涌前进，全国已有90％以上的农户加入农业生产合作社，有些省市已经基本上实现了高级形式的合作化，从初级社转高级社已经成为运动的主流，农村生产关系已经发生根本的变化。
    农村中的这个伟大的根本的变化，促进了农业生产大发展的高潮。中共中央政治局提出的全国农业发展纲要（草案），更加鼓舞了广大农民的生产积极性。农民组织起来以后，特别是组织成高级合作社，劳动生产率和劳动力的利用率，得到了更大的发挥。去年冬季，兴修水利、积肥造肥和其他各项备耕工作的成绩，超过以往任何一年。去年粮棉丰收，农业生产合作社投资再生产的能力有了显著的增加，积极添置生产资料，扩大再生产。同时，国家对于农业生产合作社的财政、经济和技术的支援，今年又有很大的增加。这些因素，对于完成1956年农业生产任务，都是非常有利的。但是，另一方面，由于农业合作化运动发展迅速，规模巨大，许多农业生产合作社建立起来之后，或者转为高级社之后，生产资料入社、劳动组织和生产计划等项问题还没有来得及妥善处理。还有不少的合作社，在生产中窝工、乱抓，责任不明，非生产性的开支过大，铺张浪费。这些问题如果不能及时解决，必将给生产以不利的影响。
    1956年是合作经济在农业经济中占居优势的第一年，也是实施全国农业发展纲要的第一年，争取1956年农业生产获得更大的丰收，争取在1956年提前和超额完成第一个五年的农业发展计划，具有重大的意义。为此，国务院对于当前的春耕生产工作，提出如下的指示：
      （一）现在春耕季节已到，当前的任务就是把农村工作的中心转到领导春耕生产方面来，进一步发挥广大群众的社会主义热情，展开大规模的春耕生产运动。凡是正在建立、扩大、合并或者升级的合作社，应当迅速完成这一工作，及时转入生产。没有进行扩大、合并或者升级的合作社，在春耕以前，就不要再变动。应当结合春耕生产，把所有已经办起来的合作社整顿好，巩固下来。对于建社、扩社、并社或者升级过程中遗留下来的问题，都要及时地妥善地加以处理；在春耕前处理不了对生产影响也不大的问题，可以先向社员讲清楚，等到春耕告一段落后，再行处理。
      （二）个体农民是自己负责安排生产的，合作社社员则是靠合作社负责安排生产的。因此，做好农业生产合作社的经营管理工作，就具有头等重要的意义。农业生产合作社应当有计划地进行生产，在春耕期间必须订出春季作业计划，以春耕播种为中心，安排各项生产。各级领导机关，特别是县、区两级，必须立即组织力量，深入农村，检查合作社的生产计划，帮助合作社把计划订得合乎实际，既积极，又可靠；并且帮助合作社编好生产队，划分耕作区，制订劳动定额，推行包工制度，按计划把春耕生产活动组织起来。
    加强对合作社会计的辅导工作，帮助合作社建立财务管理制度，认真执行“勤俭办社”的方针。目前有些合作社在合并、扩大和转为高级社以后，过早地着手并庄子，盖新房，安电灯，修马路，购买过多的文化娱乐用品和当前并不需要的生产资料，大搞非生产性的基本建设，因而开支过大，浪费合作社的人力、物力和财力，引起社员的顾虑和不满。这种铺张浪费的现象，对于合作社的巩固和生产的发展是极其不利的，必须迅速克服。
      （三）做好一切准备工作，保证及时播种、插秧，不违农时。按照国家计划，全面完成春季播种任务。粮食、棉花、大豆和其他油料作物的播种计划，必须保证完成。对各种农作物的增产、牲畜的繁殖和畜产品的增产，都不能有任何的忽视。重视粮食和棉花是对的，轻视其他作物则是不对的。1955年粮棉丰收，而许多经济作物和牲畜则没有完成发展计划。执行计划中这种片面性的毛病，必须纠正。国家工业化的发展和人民生活的提高，要求各种农产品都相应地按比例地增长，在领导生产上的任何片面性，都将给国民经济的平衡发展造成不利的影响。
      （四）春耕期间，在劳力许可的条件下，应当充分发挥合作化的优越性，组织适当的劳力，兴修小型水利，努力完成扩大灌溉面积的计划；尤其要加强技术指导，保证工程质量，克服单纯追求数量，不顾质量，忽视施工安全措施等缺点。为了预防春旱，各地应当对已修的灌溉工程，普遍加以检查，进行必要的加固和补修；并且充分准备好各种汲水、提水工具。在新式的工具供应不足的条件下，各地必须积极组织手工业，生产和修补旧式的汲水、提水工具，以免发生旱情时措手不及。为了充分发挥灌溉设施的效益，应当改进用水的管理制度，健全水利组织，教育群众改进灌溉技术，在旱作区推行沟灌、畦灌、储水保墒，在水稻区推行浅灌、勤灌等灌溉方法。
      （五）继续开展积肥运动，利用一切可能利用的肥源增积肥料，加紧培育绿肥，提高绿肥作物的产量，多养猪，多积肥，保证一切作物都有充足的肥料。农业生产合作社应当建立常年的积肥制度，除了组织社员从事沤肥、造肥的共同劳动以外，还应当组织社员家庭积肥交社使用，采取按质分等，合理计酬的办法，鼓励他们积肥的积极性。有的地方，积的肥料很多，但是大部分还没有送到地里，必须立即组织足够的力量，迅速完成送粪工作，以免耽误春耕。改进施肥方法，积极推广分期追肥和混合施肥等项经验，改漫撒肥为集中施肥，以提高肥效。化肥、饼肥和细菌肥料的数量虽然比去年增加，还是供不应求，要求各地在优先供应工业原料作物区和高产粮食作物区的原则下合理分配。各地应当尽可能地积极发展颗粒肥料制造厂，充分利用城市肥源。
      （六）各级农业部门和农业技术推广站应当迅速检查农业生产合作社的种子准备情况，协同粮食部门帮助他们解决缺种的困难。农业和粮食部门调运和供应种子的时候，要把品种特性和栽培技术给农民讲清楚，并且严格进行检验，保证发芽率合乎标准，避免危险病害和虫害的传播。各省、县农业部门应当根据当地情况分别限期建立和健全种子机构，并在县以下选择重点，迅速建立经营良种的种子站。加强种子管理和良种推广的工作。国营农场应当成为良种的繁殖基地，农业生产合作社也应当建立自己的种子地，培养管理种子的技术员，努力实现良种的推广计划。对于茶、桑、果树等多年生的作物，必须按照发展计划，在选种育苗方面预为下年作好准备。
      （七）双轮双铧犁等新式农具的推广工作，是一项细致复杂的工作。今年新式农具的需要量很大，而原料不足，制造赶不上，特别是第一季度的供应量远不能满足春耕的需要。在这种情况下，必须切实防止粗制滥造，保证产品的规格质量；必须根据各地春耕季节的早晚，妥善安排供应的先后次序，尽可能争取更多的新式农具在春耕前及时供应到农民手中；必须切实做好技术传授工作，保证教会农民使用；必须组织好修理工作，准备好零件，保证缺零件有地方配，坏了有地方修。只有这样，才能真正发挥新式农具的增产效能，以免农民买回去以后不会使用，发生故障不会修理，而搁置起来，招致群众不满。现在有些地方双轮双铧犁脱销，而另一些地方又有积压。责成各级农业、供销合作社和机械工业部门切实检查各厂出产的新式农具的质量，并且重新调整供应计划。各地还应当积极组织手工业生产合作社制造和修补旧式农具，以补新式农具之不足。
    拖拉机站必须进一步提高作业质量，充分发挥机器效能，降低作业成本，使机耕土地的单位产量不断提高，从而扭转拖拉机站年年亏蚀的现象，并且使它所服务的农业生产合作社的收入能够不断增加。
      （八）去年冬季气温较高，有利病虫越冬。对越冬病虫的防治工作做得不够彻底的地区，必须立即进行补课。在春耕中，要加强种子处理（药剂拌种和浸种等），培育无病种苗，并且注意防治地下害虫，保证全苗。加强预测预报，及时掌握病虫发生情况，指导群众防治。切实做好农药农械的贮备工作，农药要妥善保管，防止变化失效，农械也要及时进行检修。
      （九）大力保护和繁殖牲畜。春季正是牲畜配种的季节，各地必须抓紧时机做好配种工作，保护孕畜。积极帮助农业生产合作社建立耕畜饲养和役使的合理制度，以利于耕畜的保护和繁殖。供销合作部门应当努力做好耕畜的调剂工作，解决农民春耕畜力的需要。有些牧区去冬天旱，今春又有大雪，必须立即检查牲畜越冬渡春的情况，适时转移草场，做好接羔保羔的工作。
    各种畜疫常在春季流行，各地必须积极组织力量，发动群众，准备药剂，加强预防注射；已经发生疫病的地区，应当立即采取有效措施，积极治疗，防止疫病的蔓延。
      （十）局部地区，去年曾遭受水旱灾害，当前生产中的困难较大。灾区的农业生产合作社，应当充分发挥集体力量，互助互济，采用各种办法，进行生产自救。国家也应当做好灾区生产资料的供应工作，并且通过贷款、救济、以工代赈等办法，扶助灾区农民渡过春荒，顺利进行春耕生产。在组织灾区农民进行春耕生产的时候，除多种早熟作物外，还须注意组织他们从事眼前即有收入的副业生产，否则将增加他们当前生活的困难，对生产也是不利的。
    去年秋冬播种季节，有些地方因水旱失调，影响了麦苗和油菜等越冬作物的正常发育，现在必须抓紧时机，做好田间管理工作，争取小麦和油菜籽等的丰收。
      （十一）1956年的开荒计划比以往任何一年都大。开荒的重点省、区，必须抓紧时间，争取在播种季节以前开垦出更多的荒地，更多地增加当年开荒当年种植的面积。为此就必须相应地做好移民工作。其他省、区，也应当根据当地条件，在保证不破坏水土保持的前提下，有计划地开垦零星的、小片的可垦荒地。
      （十二）植树造林，大力开展水土保持工作。凡是水土流失严重的地区，都应当结合水土保持的措施，实行农业、林业和牧业的综合经营，以控制水土流失，涵养水源。在绿化的口号之下，植树造林运动已经普遍发动起来，树苗到处不足。为此，林业部门必须发展苗圃，并且有计划地帮助植树计划较大的农业生产合作社建立苗圃，以解决今后树苗的需要。造林必须严格注意质量，包栽包活。在春耕期间，也要注意森林防火，尤其在有烧山耕种和烧山取肥的习惯的地区更要严防森林火灾。
      （十三）今年国家计划发放的农业贷款，数量很大，比去年的指标约增加十五万万元。各地必须善于利用这个巨大的经济力量，来促进农业生产的发展。但是，有些地方的农贷工作是做得不好的，有的是农贷的发放不够公平合理，不该贷的贷了，该贷的没有贷；有的是贷款过多，审核不严，助长了农业生产合作社的铺张浪费；还有的是贷款大量积压在银行，不贷出去。责成各级领导机关，组织农业银行和其他有关部门的力量，对农贷工作进行一番切实的检查，正确地及时地把农业贷款发放下去，以充分发挥农贷在扶助农业生产方面应有的作用。
      （十四）要求各级领导机关，特别是农业部门，深入农村，总结群众的先进生产经验，积极地因地制宜地加以推广。大量地有计划地训练和培养农业社的技术员，开好劳模会、农业展览会，组织劳模传授先进经验，组织大面积的丰产示范和参观评比，使一社一地的先进经验，成为大家的生产实践。并且广泛地组织群众性的社会主义劳动竞赛，互相交流经验，互相帮助，发扬先进，克服落后，使社会主义的劳动竞赛成为完成1956年农业增产计划的实际推动力量。
