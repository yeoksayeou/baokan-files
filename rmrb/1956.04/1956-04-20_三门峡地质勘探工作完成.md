    Sanmenxia Geological Exploration Work Completed
    The engineering geological exploration work to provide preliminary design data for the Yellow River Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub was completed on the 11th.

    This engineering geological exploration began in May 1954. By March 11th of this year, the drilling operations of 61 boreholes had been completed. By April 11th, all the results and data had been completely compiled. These results and data have been successively sent to the design department.

    According to the preliminary inferences from this exploration data: The bedrock of the dam site is not only suitable for building a huge high dam, but also the fracturing and permeability phenomena are not very serious on this thick and hard rock base. As long as appropriate treatment is carried out, the solidity and reliability of the dam foundation can be completely guaranteed. Drilling also proved that the rock in this area is very hard diorite porphyry. Diorite porphyry is extremely resistant to weathering, and the depth of general weathering cracks is only about two meters. Not much weathered rock needs to be excavated when building the dam. Moreover, because the rock island in the river is hard, it can be used as part of the dam body after removing the weathered rock layer and treating it with grouting. The excavated weathered rock can also be used as aggregate for concrete when building the dam. In this way, a lot of manpower, materials, and construction time can be saved when building the dam.

### 三门峡地质勘探工作完成

    三门峡地质勘探工作完成
    为黄河三门峡水利枢纽提供初步设计资料的工程地质勘探工作已在十一日完成。
    这项工程地质勘探开始于1954年五月，到今年三月十一日，六十一个钻孔的钻探作业已全部完成。到四月十一日，又整理完全部成果资料。这些成果资料已陆续送交设计部门。
    根据这次勘探资料的初步推断：坝基岩石不仅适合建筑巨大的高坝，而且在这块很厚的坚硬的岩盘上，破碎、透水现象不甚严重，只要进行适当处理，完全可以保证大坝基础的坚实可靠。钻探还证明：这一带的岩石是硬度很高的闪长斑岩。闪长斑岩极耐风化，一般风化裂缝的深度仅二公尺左右，建筑大坝时需要挖掉的风化岩石并不多。而且由于河中的岩岛坚硬，在除掉风化岩层和用灌浆法处理后，还可利用它做为坝体的一部分；挖掉的风化岩石，又可做为筑坝时的混凝土的骨料。这样，建筑大坝时，可以节省许多人工、工料和施工时间。　（据新华社讯）
