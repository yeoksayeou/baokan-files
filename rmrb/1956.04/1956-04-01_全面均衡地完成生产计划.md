To the Editor:
	Our First Youth Team of the Fine Spinning Workshop in Shenyang Textile Factory, after consistently completing the state plan for twelve consecutive months last year, has comprehensively and balancedly overfulfilled the team’s production quota for January and February of 1956. We have made great achievements in saving raw materials and improving product quality: the amount of roller waste in February was reduced to 0.64%, 0.08% lower than the original plan; the amount of defective yarn was reduced by more than 60% compared to the plan. Therefore, our team was selected as representatives to attend the Liaoning Provincial Textile Industry Advanced Producers Conference and the Shenyang Municipal Factory and Enterprise Advanced Producers Conference.
	Why has our team been able to achieve such results? The main reason is that, based on the monthly work plan, we realistically formulate competition conditions for the team and individuals, focusing on key problems in production. We conscientiously implement the Hao Jianxiu work method and, based on the principle of voluntary combination, organized seven technical mutual assistance groups to exchange advanced operating methods and various experiences within the group in a timely manner. Mutual teaching and mutual learning have become a common practice in our team. This effectively improved everyone's technical operating level. We have also established a set of practical working systems, such as the roving frame operator patrol inspection system and the mutual inspection responsibility system. This prevents poor yarn quality and the occurrence of entire machines producing bad yarn.
	Chairman Mao instructed us to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment, "more, faster, better, and more economically." We must, on the basis of existing achievements, achieve the team's annual production plan ahead of schedule. We strive to ensure that by the end of the first quarter of this year, weavers can generally watch 724 spindles, and by the end of the third quarter, reduce doffing time so that everyone can reach the 1957 production level.

### 全面均衡地完成生产计划

    全面均衡地完成生产计划编辑同志：
    我们沈阳纺织厂细纱车间第一青年小组在去年连续十二个月均衡地完成了国家计划以后，又全面均衡地超额完成了1956年一、二月份的小组生产定额。在节约原料和提高产品质量方面，我们取得了很大的成绩：皮辊花在二月份已降低到0.64％，比原计划降低0.08％；坏纱比计划降低60％以上。因此，我们小组被评为出席辽宁省纺织工业先进生产者代表大会的代表和出席沈阳市工厂企业先进生产者代表大会的代表。
    为什么我们小组能够取得这样的成绩呢？主要是我们根据每月的作业计划，围绕生产中存在的关键问题，实事求是地制定小组和个人的竞赛条件。我们认真地执行着郝建秀工作法，并根据自愿结合的原则，组织了七个技术互助组，及时地交流组内的先进操作方法和各种经验。互教互学在我们小组里已经成为一种风气。这有效地提高了每个人的技术操作水平。我们还建立了一套切实可行的工作制度，像落纱长巡回检查制度，互相检查责任制度等。这就防止了纱锭质量不好和产生整台坏纱的情况。
    毛主席指示我们要“又多、又快、又好、又省”地提前和超额完成五年计划。我们一定要在现有成绩的基础上，提前实现小组全年生产规划。我们争取在今年第一季度末车工普遍能够看724个纱锭，在第三季度末减少落纱时间，使大家都能达到1957年的生产水平。
