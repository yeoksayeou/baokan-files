Moscow Correspondence

    At the Lenin Museum
    By Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He
    Modesty, simplicity, closeness to the masses, concern for comrades – these brilliant qualities unique to the immortal Lenin live forever in Lenin's biography and in the reminiscences of many old Bolsheviks in the Soviet Union. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, on the occasion of Lenin's 86th birthday, many people who came to the Lenin Museum near Red Square in Moscow paid even more attention to admiring these immortal and noble qualities of Lenin.

    In the eighteen halls of the Lenin Museum, we saw that throughout his life, even during the long years of exile and forced residence abroad, Lenin never relaxed his connection with the masses; throughout his life, even during the most intense and busy moments of work, Lenin never reduced his concern for his comrades; throughout his life, even after the victory of the October Revolution and during his serious illness, Lenin never changed his modest and simple nature and his concern for work.

    Lenin was the founder of the Bolshevik Party. In his resume, he wrote: his basic profession was a writer, he only participated in general leadership during the February Revolution, and he was a member of the Party Central Committee during the October Revolution.

    After the October Revolution, many packages were sent to Lenin from all over the Soviet Union. He immediately forwarded these items to kindergartens, schools, and other public institutions. He never opened these packages and did not like people to open them for him. In November 1922, the workers of the Klin woolen factory congratulated Lenin on the fifth anniversary of the socialist revolution and sent Lenin some of their own products. In his reply of thanks, Lenin said: "Secretly tell you, you should not send me gifts. Please widely tell all the workers about my secret request."

    In Lenin's office in the Kremlin, there were only many bookshelves, and no extra decorations. People who visited Lenin's office in winter felt that the stove was not hot enough. One of Lenin's secretaries recalled that once, in the severe winter, a bearskin was laid under Lenin's desk to prevent his feet from freezing. Lenin severely criticized this waste.

    At that time, food was very scarce, and Lenin only wanted to receive the rations of ordinary workers. Later, the Administrative Office of the Council of People's Commissars made a decision, saying that Lenin was engaged in intellectual work that did not count hours and should receive first-class rations. Only then did Lenin comply with the decision.

    Bentz Bruyevich, the director of the Administrative Office of the Council of People's Commissars, once increased Lenin's salary. Lenin gave him a warning. The document issued to the director stated: "Because you did not carry out my insistence, did not point out to me the reason for raising my salary from 500 rubles to 800 rubles per month from March 1, 1918, and because of the obviously illegal behavior of this unauthorized increase, which directly violates the decree of the Council of People's Commissars on November 23, 1917, I give you a severe warning."

    Many historical facts prove that Lenin liked to live like the working masses. He often forgot about himself, but he was very concerned about his comrades and the masses.

    In the summer of 1918, Lenin wrote to the People's Commissar of Food, Qiuliupu, who was working while ill, asking him to rest. The letter said: "You absolutely cannot treat state property like this (author's note: Lenin said that Communists are state property and are not allowed to waste this state property). You must be treated for three weeks. You must indeed correct such inexcusable and useless waste of your health."

    Workers and peasants representatives often came to the Kremlin to discuss matters with Lenin. One "certificate" signed by Lenin read: "This certificate is issued to Shaposhnikov Alexei Romanovich, a peasant from Burlakov District, Ufa County, Ufa Province, because I want him to come to Moscow to talk and discuss important matters concerning the peasant economy." Once Lenin received the laboring peasant Gorbunov. After Lenin finished talking with him, he asked him to write down everything they had talked about for the "Poor Peasants' Newspaper." Gorbunov said he could write, but his glasses were broken and it was difficult to find new ones. Lenin wrote a letter to the People's Commissar of Health saying that this peasant would write a very interesting article promoting the construction of communist society, please help him find a pair of glasses, and report the results to me.

    Lenin could not tolerate bureaucratic attitudes towards the masses. In January 1919, during a period of food shortage, Kogan, a member of the Kursk Central Purchasing Station, did not help 120 hungry workers in Moscow to get food and let them leave empty-handed. After Lenin found out, he ordered Kogan's arrest and announced the matter in newspapers and leaflets, so that all personnel in the Central Purchasing Station and food agencies knew that if they treated their work with a formalistic and bureaucratic attitude, they would be severely punished.

    When I walked out of the Lenin Museum, I couldn't help but recall a poem titled "Lenin" written by the Lithuanian Mezhilaitis, which was recently published in the Soviet "Literary Gazette":

    I sing of an ordinary man,
    Whose wisdom shines brightly,
    He values ordinary people,
    He loves ordinary people,
    Because ordinary, therefore great;
    He can see
    The hearts of awakened humanity,
    He helps ordinary people,
    He opened for ordinary people
    Roads never seen before.

### 在列宁博物馆

    在列宁博物馆
    本报驻苏联记者  李何
    谦虚、朴素、接近群众、关心同志，——不朽的列宁特有的这些光辉的作风，在列宁传记中，在苏联许多老布尔什维克的回忆中，永远活现着。在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，在列宁八十六诞辰的日子里，许多来到莫斯科红场附近的列宁博物馆的人们，更注意景仰列宁的这些永不磨灭的高尚的品质。
    在列宁博物馆的十八个厅里，我们看到了：列宁在他的一生中，甚至在被流放和被迫侨居国外的漫长岁月中，也没有放松和群众的联系；列宁在他的一生中，甚至在工作最紧张和最忙碌的时刻，也没有减少对同志们的关怀；列宁在他的一生中，甚至在十月革命胜利以后和重病期间，也丝毫没有改变谦虚朴素的本色和对工作的关心。
    列宁是布尔什维克党的创始人。在履历表上，他是这样填写的：基本职业是文字工作者，在二月革命时只参加一般的领导，在十月革命时是党中央委员会的一个委员。
    十月革命以后，苏联全国各地赠送给列宁许多包裹，他立即把这些物品转送给幼儿园、学校等等公共机关。他向来不拆开这些包裹，也不喜欢人家替他拆开。1922年11月，克林次的呢子工厂工人们向列宁祝贺社会主义革命五周年，并且送给列宁他们自己的一些产品。列宁回信答谢时说：“秘密地告诉你们，不应该送我礼物。务请把我这个秘密的请求广泛地告诉所有工人。”
    在克里姆林宫内的列宁办公室，只有很多书架，而没有什么多余的摆设。冬天到过列宁办公室的人觉得那里火炉烧得不够热。一位列宁的秘书回忆说，有一回，在严寒的冬天，在列宁的办公桌下铺一张熊皮，免得他冻脚。列宁严厉地责备这种浪费。
    当时粮食很困难，列宁只愿领取普通工人的口粮。后来人民委员会的管理处作出了决定，说列宁从事不计钟点的智力劳动，应得一等的口粮。列宁才服从了决定。
    人民委员会管理处处长本茨·布鲁耶维奇有一次给列宁增加了工资。列宁给他一个警告。发给这位处长的文件说：“由于您没有执行我坚持的要求，没有向我指出从1918年3月1日起把我的薪金从每月五百卢布提高到八百卢布的理由，和由于这种擅自提高的直接违反人民委员会1917年11月23日法令的显然不合法行为，我给您严厉的警告。”
    许多历史事实证明：列宁最喜欢和劳动群众一样生活。他常常忘记自己，但他非常关心同志和群众。
    在1918年夏天，列宁写信给抱病工作的粮食人民委员秋留普，要他休息。信里说：“您完全不可以这样对待国家财产（作者按：列宁说过，共产党员是国家财产，不允许糟踏这个国家财产）。要您治疗三个星期。确实要改正那样不可原谅地无益地耗费自己的健康。”
    经常有工人农民代表来克里姆林宫找列宁商量事情。有一份列宁签署的“证明书”写道：“本证明书发给乌发省乌发县布尔加科夫区别克托沃村农民沙波什尼科夫·阿列克塞伊·罗曼诺维奇，因为我要他到莫斯科来谈话和商量关于农民经济的重要事情”。有一次列宁接见了劳动农民高尔布诺夫。列宁和他谈完话，请他把他所谈的一切写下来给“贫农报”。高尔布诺夫说可以写，但他的眼镜打破了，很难找到新的。列宁写了信给卫生人民委员说，这位农民将写出很有兴趣的宣传建设共产主义社会的文章，请帮他找一付眼镜，并且把结果向我报告。
    列宁不能容忍对待群众的官僚主义态度。在1919年1月粮食困难时期，库尔斯克中央收购站委员柯根，没有帮助莫斯科一百二十个饿着肚子的工人得到粮食，便让他们空手走掉。列宁知道以后就下令逮捕柯根，并且把这件事情在报纸和传单上公布，使得中央收购站和粮食机关所有人员知道：要是以形式主义的和官僚主义的态度对待事业，将受到严厉的处罚。
    当我走出列宁博物馆的时候，我不禁想起最近苏联“文学报”上发表的立陶宛人梅日来狄斯写的一首题为“列宁”的诗：
    我歌唱一位普通人，
    他的贤明发出光彩，
    他重视普通人，
    他喜爱普通人，
    因为普通所以伟大；
    他能够看到
    觉醒了的人类的心灵，
    他给普通人以帮助，
    他替普通人打开了
    从未见过的道路。
