    Actively Organize Township Vendors to Deliver Goods to the Countryside
    Kong Sang
    Since the Spring Festival this year, the business volume of many market towns has declined. What is the reason for this? It is not that farmers lack purchasing power, but that farmers, after joining agricultural producers' cooperatives, are very busy with production and cannot spare time to go to market towns to buy things.
    The new situation has put forward a new requirement for commercial cooperative departments: In order to expand sales and meet the needs of farmers, they should no longer sit in market towns and "wait for customers," but should actively organize vendors to deliver goods to the countryside.
    The experience of the Suzhou Special District proves that organizing township vendors to deliver goods to the countryside is an important method to support agricultural production, improve business operations, and weather the off-season smoothly. Through the activities of vendors, not only is the sales channel of commodities opened up, and the further transformation of small vendors is promoted, but also the commercial departments further understand the needs of the countryside.
    When organizing township vendors to deliver goods to the countryside, various localities must make comprehensive arrangements, taking into account the balance between townships and townships. Methods such as designating areas, villages, points, and people can be adopted to avoid vendors only going to nearby villages and not to distant villages, or only going to large villages and not to small villages, resulting in confusion of mutual duplication and conflict. At the same time, the business operations in the towns should also be properly arranged, and vendors should not flock to the countryside en masse, so as not to affect the supply work in the towns.
    At present, many places are organizing township vendors to deliver goods to the countryside. Party organizations at the county and district levels should pay attention to studying and summarizing the experience in this regard in a timely manner, and strengthen the leadership of this work. Areas that have not yet carried out this work should actively organize this work to ensure that the supply work to the countryside is done well.

    积极组织集镇商贩送货下乡
    孔桑
    今年春节以后，许多集镇的商业营业额都下降了。这是什么原因呢？这不是农民没有购买力，而是农民参加农业生产合作社以后，生产非常紧张，抽不出时间到集镇上去买东西。
    新的情况给商业合作部门提出了一个新的要求：为了扩大推销，满足农民的需要，不应该再坐在集镇上“等客上门”了，而应该积极地组织商贩送货下乡。
    苏州专区的经验证明：组织集镇商贩送货下乡是支持农业生产、搞好经营、稳渡淡季的一个重要方法。通过商贩的活动，不仅打开了商品的销路，推动了对小商贩的进一步改造；同时，也使商业部门进一步了解农村的需要。
    各地在组织集镇商贩送货下乡的时候，必须进行全面安排，照顾到集镇和集镇之间的平衡，可以采取划片、定村、定点、定人的办法，以避免商贩下乡只跑近村、不跑远村或只去大村、不去小村，造成互相重复、互相冲突的混乱现象。同时，对于集镇上的营业也要妥善安排，不要让商贩一窝蜂地跑下乡去，以免影响集镇的供应工作。
    目前，不少地方在组织集镇商贩送货下乡，县和区的党组织应该注意研究并且及时总结这方面的经验，加强对这一工作的领导。还没有进行这一工作的地区，则应该积极组织这项工作，保证做好对农村的供应工作。
