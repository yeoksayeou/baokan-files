Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Locations Actively Supply Pesticides and Equipment

    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in various locations are actively preparing the supply of pesticides and equipment to help farmers do a good job in pest control and seedling protection this spring. Jiangsu Province has already allocated 5,115 tons of various chemical pesticides and 30,230 pieces of equipment. In Zhejiang Province, in just the recent period, 1,302 tons of pesticides and 2,022 pieces of equipment have been sold and pre-sold. Provinces such as Anhui and Shandong are carrying out the pre-sale of pesticides and equipment.

    In order to solve the difficulty that pesticides and equipment cannot universally meet the needs of local farmers, Jiangsu Province has recently resumed the processing of indigenous pesticides and decided to process 2,500 tons of cottonseed oil soap and 1,000 tons of lime sulfur mixture in areas such as Songjiang, Nantong, and Suzhou. These two indigenous pesticides can prevent and control pests on 4.8 million mu of farmland. In order to make up for the shortage of chemical pesticides, the Zhejiang Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has designated full-time cadres to be responsible for organizing the management and allocation of indigenous pesticides, and is preparing to utilize effective indigenous pesticides such as aged rosin and sulfur blocks for pest control.

    Various locations have also held technical training classes on the use of pesticides and equipment, training a large number of cadres and farmers, enabling them to learn the techniques for using pesticides and equipment.

    各地供销合作社积极供应农药药械
    各地供销合作社正在积极准备农药械的供应，帮助农民做好今春治虫保苗工作。江苏省目前已经下拨各种化学农药5，115吨，药械30，230架。浙江省仅在最近一个时期，现售和预售的农药有1，302吨，药械2，022架。安徽、山东等省正在开展农药药械的预售工作。
    为了解决农药药械不能普遍满足当地农民需要的困难。江苏省最近已恢复了土农药的加工，决定在松江、南通、苏州等地区加工二千五百吨棉油皂、一千吨石灰硫黄合剂。这两项土药可以防治四百八十万亩田的虫害。浙江省为了弥补化学农药的不足，省供销合作社已指定专职干部负责组织土农药的经营调剂，将治虫有效的陈松脂、硫黄块等土农药准备加以利用。
    各地还举办了农药药械使用技术训练班，训练了大批的干部和农民，使他们学会了农药药械的使用技术。
