Xinhua News Agency, April 28th dispatch from London via TASS: Bulganin and Khrushchev held a press conference on the morning of April 27th at the famous Central Hall in London.

Approximately four hundred reporters from British and foreign newspapers, radio stations, and newsreel companies gathered in the hall. At the press conference, Bulganin read out a statement from the Soviet leaders.

The statement said that after this visit, we are convinced that the British people do not want war, but hope for peace and hope to develop friendly relations with the Soviet people. We will report our impressions to the Soviet people with great satisfaction.

After reviewing the Soviet leaders' visits and tours in Britain, the statement expressed heartfelt gratitude to the British people and Queen, as well as other government officials and political representatives for their warm hospitality.

The statement said that the hopes we had for this visit and the talks have not been dashed. The joint Soviet-British statement issued today is a document of great political significance. Undoubtedly, this statement will be welcomed by all those who are concerned about further easing international tensions and building trust between countries.

The statement said that there were disputed issues and differences during the negotiations. This is not surprising. Britain is a member of the Atlantic bloc, and we do not like this bloc. Even members of the same family sometimes argue with each other. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union is not a member of the Atlantic bloc, and Britain is not a member of the Warsaw Pact. Therefore, there were dark moments in our two countries' relations and in our negotiations. This was fully recognized by both sides.

However, both sides were equally fully aware that our two countries' great responsibility for maintaining international peace and the deep concern of the Soviet and British people for maintaining and further consolidating the relations between our two countries had a decisive impact on the outcome of our negotiations.

Whether some people like it or not, the Soviet Union and Britain will seek a common language in one way or another on the development of the situation, at least on the major issues of maintaining peace.

Speaking of the main results of the talks, the statement said that we Soviets take seriously the plans to develop British-Soviet relations in the political, economic, cultural, scientific, and technological fields, and will strive to realize them. We have no reason to doubt that the British government does not hold the same view.

It should be especially emphasized that the Soviet government and the government of the United Kingdom believe that the basis for friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence between all countries with different social systems is respect for national independence and sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference internal affairs. This is a principle followed by many countries in their international relations. This is a healthy foundation for the development of British-Soviet relations. We believe that the results of the talks have brought the attitudes of our two governments closer.

Our efforts to establish friendly relations with Britain do not require harming Britain's relations with its friendly countries. Britain, which has good relations with the United States, can also help us establish good relations with the United States. We have established not bad relations with France. Our relations with the United States are still very abnormal. For our part, we will do everything possible to improve Soviet-American relations in the future.

The statement then addressed the issue of disarmament, which all countries yearn to resolve. The statement said that the situation regarding disarmament has been consistently unfavorable. On many issues, we proposed adopting suggestions originally put forward by Western countries, such as the issue of the level of armed forces of the five major powers. But now we have to defend these suggestions of the Western countries in front of the representatives of the Western countries. As soon as we express our agreement with their suggestions, they rush to reject them. You may know what's going on, but it's a mystery to us.

The Soviet government has repeatedly put forward constructive proposals, which, once adopted, would be a realistic step forward in solving the disarmament problem. We have advocated and continue to advocate the unconditional prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, and resolutely advocate the prohibition of testing such weapons.

During the negotiations, both sides agreed that freeing mankind from the threat of nuclear war is a very important task, and we are satisfied with this point. At the same time, both sides recognized the need to reach an agreement on an immediate and substantial reduction of troops and armaments.

The statement, after pointing out that certain Western countries do not want to ban atomic weapons and reach an agreement on the entire disarmament issue, expressed the hope that major powers will find opportunities to take some practical steps toward halting the arms race. In any case, the Soviet Union will continue to do its best to promote the solution of this issue in the future.

In order to adopt the opinions of Western countries and reach the necessary agreement, the Soviet government stated that it is prepared to consider the issue of reducing conventional armaments on the one hand, and the issue of prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons on the other, but does not believe that an agreement on conventional armaments depends on an agreement on atomic weapons.

The statement said that we exchanged views with representatives of the British government on the situation in the Near and Middle East. We believe that the establishment of military blocs such as the Baghdad Pact is the main source of international disputes and conflicts in the Near and Middle East, and the cause of the deterioration of relations between Arab countries and Israel and between other countries. Britain does not agree with our view on this issue, and we cannot consider the opinions of the British representatives on this issue to be correct.

At the same time, as a result of a useful exchange of views, an agreement was reached on maintaining peace and security in the Near and Middle East.

The Soviet Union has only peaceful interests in the countries of the Near and Middle East, and the interests of peaceful international cooperation based on respecting their national independence, sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs, and no other interests. We have defended and will continue to defend these principles in the past.

The agreement reached on the Near and Middle East issue gives the two countries a considerable possibility to set an example of working together for the cause of peace in such an important region as the Near and Middle East.

The statement said: The issue of developing trade relations between the Soviet Union and Britain was a significant item on the agenda. As a result of the negotiations, the Soviet Union and Britain reached an agreement on the mutual purchase of large quantities of goods.

The Soviet Union has always opposed all kinds of discrimination and restrictions in international trade. This restriction is a product of the Cold War. However, times have changed, and it is now time to throw this restriction into the garbage bin and open the door to international trade. Britain's situation on this issue is delicate. However, the British are realistic and serious, and sooner or later they will find a fairly thoughtful way to replace the current discriminatory trade policies that restrict trade with a more sober trade policy. We will only welcome this.

The statement said that trade on a healthy basis will promote the resolution of political issues. Without developing trade and eliminating the various restrictions and discrimination that hinder the normalization of international relations, it is impossible to seriously talk about the issue of disarmament.

The statement said that the negotiations between the two sides on further developing contacts and ties in the cultural, scientific, and technological fields were fruitful, and the relevant documents that are an integral part of the joint statement reflect this result. The Soviet government believes that our two countries' ties in culture, science and technology, sports, etc., can and will be extensively developed.

The statement said that the results of the talks prove that as long as there is sincerity and consideration for the interests of both sides, serious differences can be overcome to a certain extent, and good results can be achieved on some of the most important issues, such as British-Soviet relations and some other international issues.

Bulganin finally said in the statement that during the talks, Khrushchev and I, representing the Soviet government, invited the Prime Minister to visit the Soviet Union. The Prime Minister accepted this invitation. Due to his other official duties, the time of the visit has not yet been determined. We believe that Sir Eden's visit to our country will be of great significance for further strengthening British-Soviet relations and will promote the relaxation of international tensions.

Finally, we take this opportunity of the press conference to express our best wishes to the people of the United Kingdom, wishing them happiness and prosperity, and wishing them success in the struggle for world peace.

Subsequently, Bulganin and Khrushchev answered many questions raised by the reporters.

Someone asked: Khrushchev said in Birmingham on April 23 that the chains that bind international trade should and must be broken. How can this statement be reconciled with the claim that the Soviet Union does not intend to drive a wedge between British-American relations?

Khrushchev said: We not only do not want to drive a wedge between American-British relations, but we want to pull out such wedges so that all countries and peoples can get closer to each other. We on our side hope to get closer to the British people and the country of Britain, closer to the United States, and closer to any country that advocates peaceful coexistence. As for the issue of trade, there is indeed a wedge inserted between the United States and Britain, but it was not us, but the United States that inserted it. We believe that Britain is concerned about breaking the chains so as to embark on the broad road of international trade. This is in Britain's interest.

In response to a question about the prospects for peaceful coexistence after the British-Soviet talks, Bulganin said: In our view, the prospects are very good. We believe that these prospects will become even better in the future.

Someone asked: Are you willing to go to the United States? Khrushchev replied: The United States is a very interesting country. If a person has something to do in the United States, then how can he not want to go? The Soviets often express their desire to go to the United States. Unfortunately, sometimes our people even receive invitations to visit the United States, but they cannot get entry permits from the US authorities. Not long ago, a group of our chefs were invited to visit the United States, but the US authorities did not dare to let them go there, apparently fearing that what they made would not be cutlets but something else. (The hall livened up) We regret this relationship and hope that this relationship will improve to the benefit of both countries.

Someone asked: What do you think of the working and living conditions in Britain? Khrushchev said: Everyone knows that Britain's economic and cultural level is very high, but we have not had the opportunity to directly contact and talk with ordinary people in Britain. We mainly saw them through the car windows when we were passing through the streets of your cities in cars. Therefore, it is difficult for us to answer this question in detail.

A reporter asked: Does the Soviet Union allow Western inspectors to go to any place in the Soviet Union on a mutual basis to check whether atomic or hydrogen bombs are being manufactured?

Khrushchev said: Comrade Gromyko has answered these questions at the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Committee until his hair turned white. Please take a look at his speech at the subcommittee meeting. Everything is explained clearly in his speech. (The venue is active, and someone shouts: He doesn't have white hair yet) I expect his hair to turn white before they reach an agreement there.

When talking about whether the strength of the Soviet Union is concentrated in the hands of a few people, Khrushchev said: The Soviet Union probably has 200 million people. This means that the strength of the Soviet Union is concentrated in 400 million hands. This number will continue to grow. Bulganin said: At least 3 million people are added every year, which means 6 million hands are added every year.

In response to a question about whether the Soviet Union will reduce its arms supply to Middle Eastern countries, Khrushchev said: We did not supply anyone with weapons originally, and we hope that other countries will do the same. But weapons are still being supplied. Therefore, if we tell you that we will refuse any request to sell weapons, our answer would not be correct, because other countries are selling weapons. Therefore, our position can be expressed as follows: If countries can reach an agreement on all these issues through the United Nations or some other means, we will support and welcome such an agreement. This would make it possible to create conditions for peaceful and tranquil life in all parts of the world that are still turbulent today. We will not evade participating in this good thing, because doing so is beneficial to mankind.

Someone asked: Are the Soviet leaders prepared to visit France? Khrushchev replied: We are representatives of a major country and bear very heavy responsibilities. Naturally, we are limited in choosing the time of our visit. But if the conditions are ripe and it is necessary, we are prepared to visit any country.

The press conference ended after an hour and a half. (Attached picture)

### 苏联领导人在离开英国以前举行记者招待会

    苏联领导人在离开英国以前举行记者招待会
    新华社28日讯  据塔斯社伦敦讯：布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫四月二十七日早晨在伦敦著名的会议大厅——中央大厅举行了记者招待会。
    聚集在大厅中的英国和外国报纸、电台和新闻电影厂的记者约有四百人，布尔加宁在记者招待会上宣读了苏联领导人的声明。
    声明说，经过这次访问我们相信了，英国人民不要战争，而希望和平，希望同苏联人民发展友好关系。我们要十分满意地把自己的印象告诉苏联人民。
    声明在回顾了苏联领导人在英国访问和参观的经过以后对英国人民和英国女王、以及其他政府官员和政界代表所给予的热烈招待表示衷心的感谢。
    声明说，我们对这次访问和会谈所抱的希望并没有落空。今天所发表的苏英会谈联合声明是具有重大政治意义的文件。毫无疑问，这个声明将受到一切关心进一步缓和国际紧张局势和建立国与国之间的信任的人们的欢迎。
    声明说，在谈判中有过争执的问题，有分歧的地方。这是没有什么可奇怪的，英国是大西洋集团的成员国，而我们是不喜欢这个集团的。就是一个家庭的成员有时也不免互相争执。大家知道，我们苏联不是大西洋集团的成员国，而英国也不是华沙条约的成员国。因此在我们两国的关系上以及在我们的谈判中有过黑暗的时刻。这是双方都充分认识到的。
    不过，双方也同样充分地认识到：我们两国对维护国际和平的重大责任以及苏英两国人民对保持和进一步巩固我们两国之间的关系的深切关怀，对我们两国的谈判的结果有决定的意义。
    不管有人喜欢不喜欢，苏联和英国将就事态的发展，至少在维护和平的主要问题上采取这种或那种方式寻求共同的语言。
    声明在谈到会谈的主要结果时说，我们苏联人认真接受关于发展英苏两国在政治、经济、文化和科学技术各方面的关系的计划，并且将努力使它实现。我们没有理由怀疑英国政府不抱同样的看法。
    应当特别强调指出，苏联政府和联合王国政府相信：社会制度不同的各国的友好合作和和平共处的基础是尊重国家独立和主权、领土完整和互不干涉内政。这是世界上许多国家在自己国际关系中所遵循的原则。这是发展英苏关系的健康基础。我们认为，会谈的结果，我们两国政府的态度接近了。
    我们争取同英国建立友好关系并不需要搞坏英国同它的友好国家的关系。同美国有交情的英国也可以帮助我们同美国建立良好关系。我们同法国建立了不坏的关系。我们和美国的关系还很不正常，从我们这方面来说，今后将尽一切努力来改善苏联同美国的关系。
    声明接着谈到各国人民都渴望解决的裁军问题。声明说，裁军问题的情况一直是不好的。在很多问题上，我们提议采纳西方国家原先提出的建议，例如，关于五大国武装部队水平的问题。但是我们现在却不得不在西方国家代表的面前来维护西方国家的这些建议。当我们一表示同意它们的建议，它们就赶紧拒绝这些建议。你们也许知道这是怎么回事，而对我们来说却是一个谜。
    苏联政府一再提出建设性的建议，这些建议一经采纳就是现实地在解决裁军问题的道路上迈进一步。我们过去和现在都主张无条件地禁止原子武器和热核子武器，坚决主张禁止试验这类武器。
    在谈判过程中，双方都认为使人类摆脱核子战争威胁是非常重要的任务，我们对这点表示满意。同时，双方承认有必要达成一项立即大量裁减军队和军备的协议。
    声明在指出某些西方国家不希望禁止原子武器和就整个裁军问题达成协议以后表示，希望大国将找寻机会做出向停止扩充军备方面迈进的某些实际的步骤。无论如何，苏联今后仍将尽力促进这个问题的解决。
    为了采纳西方国家的意见，为了达成必要的协议，苏联政府声明，它准备一方面考虑裁减常规军备问题，一方面考虑禁止原子武器和氢武器问题，但是，并不认为就常规军备达成协议取决于就原子武器问题达成协议。
    声明说，我们同英国政府的代表对中近东局势交换了意见。我们认为，建立像巴格达条约这一类的军事集团是造成国际纠纷和中近东地区的冲突的主要根源和阿拉伯国家同以色列之间以及其他国家之间关系恶化的原因。英国不同意我们对这个问题的看法，而我们也不能认为英国代表们对这个问题的意见是正确的。
    同时，由于对意见进行了有益的交换，双方在维护中近东的和平和安全方面达成了协议。
    苏联在近东和中东的国家中只有和平的利益以及在尊重它们的民族独立、主权和不干涉内政的基础上进行国际的和平合作的利益，此外并无任何其他利益。我们过去捍卫了，今后还将捍卫这些原则。
    在近东和中东的问题上达成的协议，使两国有不小的可能树立起在像近东和中东这样重要的地区为和平事业共同工作的榜样。
    声明说：关于发展苏联和英国之间的贸易关系的问题是谈判中有重大意义的项目。谈判结果使得苏英两国就相互大量购货问题达成了协议。
    苏联一直反对国际贸易中的种种歧视和限制。这种限制是冷战的产物。但是，时代已经改变了，现在已经是把这种限制扔到垃圾箱里去，为国际贸易敞开大门的时候了。英国在这个问题上的处境是微妙的。但是，英国人是实事求是的和认真的，他们自己早晚会找到相当周到的方式，用比较清醒的贸易政策来代替现行的限制贸易的歧视政策。对于这一点，我们将只有欢迎。
    声明说，在健康的基础上的贸易将会促进政治问题的解决。不发展贸易，不消除阻挠国际关系正常化的种种限制和歧视，要想认真地谈裁军问题是不可能的。
    声明说，双方关于进一步发展文化、科学和技术方面的接触和联系的谈判是富有成果的，作为联合声明一个组成部分的有关文件反映了这种成果。苏联政府认为，我们两国在文化、科学技术、体育等等方面的联系能够而且一定会广泛地发展起来。
    声明说，会谈的结果证明，只要具有诚意和考虑到双方的利益，就能在一定程度上克服严重的分歧，并且能在一些最重要的问题上，例如英苏关系问题以及其他一些国际问题上取得良好的结果。
    布尔加宁最后在声明中说，在会谈期间，赫鲁晓夫和我代表苏联政府邀请了首相先生访问苏联。首相先生接受了这个邀请。由于他有其他公务，访问时间暂时没有确定。我们相信，艾登爵士的访问我国将对进一步加强英苏关系有重大的意义，并且将促进国际紧张局势的缓和。
    最后，我们利用这次记者招待会的机会向联合王国的人民表示最好的祝愿，祝他们幸福和繁荣，祝他们在争取世界和平的斗争中取得成就。
    接着，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫回答了记者们提出的许多问题。
    有人问：赫鲁晓夫四月二十三日在伯明翰说，束缚着国际贸易的锁链应该而且必将被打断。这个声明同苏联不打算在英美关系中打进一个楔子的说法怎么调和得起来呢？
    赫鲁晓夫说：我们不仅不想在美英关系中打进楔子，而且想拔出这种楔子，好让各个国家和人民彼此接近。我们这方面希望同英国人民和英国这个国家接近，同美国接近，同主张和平共处的任何一个国家接近。至于谈到贸易问题，美英之间的确是插进了一个楔子，但是不是我们，而是美国插进去的。我们认为，英国是关心打破锁链、以便走上国际贸易的康庄大道的。这是符合英国的利益的。
    在回答关于英苏谈判以后和平共处的前景的问题时，布尔加宁说：在我们看来，远景是非常美好的。我们认为，这种远景在今后还会变得更好。
    有人问：你们愿意到美国去吗？赫鲁晓夫回答说：美国是一个很有趣的国家。如果一个人在美国有事情，那么他怎么会不希望去呢。苏联人常常表示希望到美国去。不过遗憾的是，我们的人有时候甚至得到了访问美国的邀请，却得不到美国当局的入境许可。不久以前，我们的一批厨师被邀请去访问美国，美国当局却不敢让他们到那里去，显然害怕他们做出来的不是炸肉排而是别的东西。（大厅里活跃起来）我们对这种关系感到遗憾，并且希望这种关系改善而有利于两国。
    有人问：您认为英国的工作条件和生活条件怎样？赫鲁晓夫说：大家都知道，英国的经济和文化水平是很高的，不过我们没有机会同英国的普通人直接接触和交谈。我们主要是坐在汽车里经过你们城市的街道的时候，隔着汽车的玻璃窗看到他们。所以，我们很难详细地回答这个问题。
    有记者问：苏联是否准许西方的检查人员在相互的基础上到苏联境内的任何地方去检查，看看是不是在制造原子弹或氢弹。
    赫鲁晓夫说：葛罗米柯同志在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上回答这些问题回答得头发都变白了。请你们看一下他在小组委员会会议上的发言。他的发言中把一切都说清楚了。（会场活跃，有人喊：他还没有白头发）我料想直到他们在那里谈妥以前，他的头发是会变白的。
    在谈到苏联的实力是不是集中在少数几个人手中的问题时，赫鲁晓夫表示：苏联大概有两亿人。这就是说，苏联的实力集中在四亿只手中。这个数目还要增长。布尔加宁说：每年至少增加三百万人，就是说每年增加六百万只手。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答关于苏联是否将缩减给中东国家的军火供应的问题时说：我们本来并不供给任何人武器，并且希望其他国家也这样做。但是武器还是有人供应。因此，如果我们对你们说，对请求卖武器的任何要求，我们方面都加以拒绝，那我们的回答就不正确了，因为其他国家在出卖武器。因此我们的立场可以表述如下：如果能够通过联合国或某种别的途径使各国就所有这些问题达成协议，我们将会支持并且欢迎这种协议。这样就有可能在目前还动荡不安的世界各地创造和平安宁生活的条件。我们不会逃避参予这种好事，因为这样做有利于人类。
    有人问：苏联领导人是否准备访问法国，赫鲁晓夫回答说：我们是一个大国的代表，负有很重大的责任。在选择我们的访问时间上，自然我们是有限制的。但是如果条件成熟，而且有必要的话，我们准备访问任何一个国家。
    记者招待会经过一个半小时后结束。（附图片）
