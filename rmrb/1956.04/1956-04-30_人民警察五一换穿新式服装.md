    People's police nationwide will don formal new uniforms on May 1st.
    The style of the new uniform is as follows: Summer uniforms will be bleached white or grass green for the upper garment, depending on the police division; men's trousers and women's skirts will be navy blue. Men will wear peaked caps, and women will wear brimless caps, with grass-green cap bands. Winter uniforms will all be navy blue. The brims of the People's Police caps, the collar edges and cuffs of the winter uniforms, and both sides of the trousers and skirts will be trimmed with red stripes. The red stripes on the trousers of people's police cadres will be wide, while the red stripes on the trousers of police officers will be narrow.
    The cap insignia of the People's Police, which originally had a five-pointed star with the words "Public Security" engraved on it, will be changed to a circular "national flag" cap insignia. (Xinhua News Agency)

    人民警察五一换穿新式服装
    全国人民警察将在五月一日穿上正规的新式服装。
    这种新式服装制式是：夏季服装按警种上衣分漂白、草绿两色，男裤子和女裙子都是藏青色。男的戴大沿帽，女的戴无沿帽，帽墙为草绿色。冬季服装都是藏青色。人民警察的帽沿边、冬服领边、袖头和裤、裙两侧都镶有红色线条。民警干部裤侧红线条是宽的，警士裤侧红线条是窄的。
    人民警察原五角星上镌有“公安”字样的帽徽，改为圆形“国旗”帽徽。（新华社）
