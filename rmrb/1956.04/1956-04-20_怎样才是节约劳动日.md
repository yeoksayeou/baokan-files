Some management committees of agricultural producers' cooperatives, in order to "save labor days" and "increase the value of each labor day," have adopted the following methods:

Some designate many tasks within the cooperative as "obligatory labor," shared by laborers and not recorded as labor days.

Some limit the number of days women and semi-laborers participate in production labor, or give them fewer labor days for doing the same work.

Some set work quotas (the quantity and quality of various tasks that a medium-level laborer can complete daily under normal conditions) too high, or set the compensation for completing a quota too low.

Some try to minimize the participation of members in labor as much as possible, stipulating a maximum number of labor days that a laborer or household can work; and adopt a "work in shifts" approach, letting members who are not on shift "rest."

Some even halt necessary basic construction projects that could be carried out, and even plan to reduce the intensity of cultivation for certain crops, such as reducing the number of weeding sessions.

Some even criticize members who strive to do more work or heavier work (which yields more work points) for having "work point thinking" or "work pointism."

An agricultural producers' cooperative in Daxingzhuang, Lingqiu County, Shanxi Province, once calculated as follows: one mu of land requires seven labor days, and one labor day can yield one dou of grain; if one mu of land requires fourteen labor days, although the total income will increase, each labor day will yield less than one dou. They did not calculate that if they practiced intensive cultivation according to actual needs, using fourteen labor days per mu, even if the grain earned per labor day was less, the grain earned by a laborer in a year would still increase.

Not recording labor days for many tasks, or excessively raising work quotas and lowering compensation standards, may seem like "the meat rots in the pot," with everyone benefiting from increased production, and the dividend per labor day sounds good, and the "reputation" is better. But who exactly are we fooling? "Assigning obligatory labor" inevitably leads to many troubles; raising work quotas makes it difficult to formulate labor force usage plans and discourages members because they cannot complete the quotas even with strenuous effort; lowering compensation standards is also not conducive to encouraging members' enthusiasm for labor.

What exactly is meant by "saving labor days" should be viewed correctly.

Saving labor days does not mean that using fewer labor days is always better.

Saving labor days mainly means: labor days should be used in the most appropriate places; labor days should be calculated correctly and reasonably.

Do not record labor days in the cooperative for things that are not directly related to production (such as performing plays, doing Yangko dances, holding Party and Youth League meetings, etc.).

Do not use labor days on certain basic construction projects that are not urgently needed (such as building large offices, large auditoriums, etc.) when production has not been substantially increased.

Agricultural sideline production and basic construction should be well-planned comprehensively, with priorities identified, a sequence established, and a certain number of labor days invested in a planned manner each year.

Members who are active in their work, innovative, and have improved work efficiency and output should be appropriately credited with more labor days.

Members who are lazy, disregard work quality, and do not meet the quota should be reasonably credited with fewer labor days.

Work compensation standards should be set reasonably, and relatively simple and light work should not be placed in the same category as relatively complex and heavy work.

Bidding schemes should be formulated accurately, carefully investigating the soil quality, previous crops, variety characteristics, and agricultural tools used in each production team's cultivated area, and correctly calculating the number of labor days required based on work quotas.

Help members strive to improve their skills and improve working conditions, in order to gradually increase work quotas.

Gradually adopt advanced agricultural implements and sideline tools as much as possible, in order to obtain more products with less labor.

Pay attention to improving labor organization, consolidating labor discipline, and strive to achieve everyone doing their best.

Make every effort to increase the total output and total income of the cooperative.

Only in this way is it truly "saving labor days"; can we closely combine "increasing the value of each labor day" and "increasing the total income of each member."

In the "March 8th" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, when sixteen "labor units" were used per mu of land, the grain yield was 400 jin, with each "labor unit" amounting to 25 jin; when 22 "labor units" were used per mu of land, the grain yield increased to 703 jin, with each "labor unit" amounting to more than 30 jin. It can be seen that the value of each labor day does not necessarily decrease when more labor days are used. Furthermore, even if thirty "labor units" were used instead of twenty-two "labor units," although the income per "labor unit" would be less than twenty-five jin, what would be wrong with harvesting more than 300 jin of grain per mu compared to using sixteen "labor units"?

Last year, the "Red Star" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hejian County, Hebei Province, promoted many new measures to increase production, which used a lot more labor days. As a result of the distribution, each labor day was worth 1.22 yuan; in general cooperatives in the county, the number of labor days used per mu of land was not as high as in the "Red Star" cooperative, but each labor day was only worth about 1.1 yuan. In terms of the income per laborer, the income of "Red Star" cooperative members was even higher. Compared with the average cooperative in the county, each male laborer earned 50% more and each female laborer earned more than twice as much in that year.

    怎样才是节约劳动日
    燕凌
    有些农业生产合作社的管理委员会，为了“节约劳动日”和“提高每个劳动日的价值”，采取了这样一些办法：
    有的把社内许多工作规定为“义务工”，按劳动力分担，不记劳动日。
    有的限制妇女和半劳动力参加生产劳动的天数，或者做同样的工作而少给她们记劳动日。
    有的把工作定额（中等劳动力在正常条件下每天能做的各种工作的数量和质量）规定得过高，或者把完成一个定额应得的报酬规定得很低。
    有的尽可能地少让社员参加劳动，规定一个劳动力或者一户最多只能做多少个劳动日，不能超过；并且采取了“轮班干活”的办法，让轮不到的社员“休息”。
    有的甚至停止了必要的可能进行的基本建设，还打算降低某些作物精耕细作的程度，如减少锄地遍数等。
    有的甚至批评争着多做工作、做比较重（工分也比较多）的工作的社员是“挣工分思想”“工分主义”。
    山西省灵丘县大兴庄的一个农业生产合作社曾经这样算账：一亩地用七个劳动日，一个劳动日可以分一斗粮食；一亩地如果用十四个劳动日，虽然总收入会增加，但是每个劳动日就分不到一斗了。他们却没有计算：如果按照实际的需要，实行精耕细作，一亩地用十四个劳动日，即使一个劳动日分的粮食少了些，但是一个劳动力一年分的粮食还是增加了。
    许多工作不记劳动日，或者过多地提高工作定额、降低报酬标准，似乎是“肉烂在锅里”，增产了大家都有分，说起来一个劳动日分红多，“名声”也好听。可是，这到底是哄谁呢？“派义务工”，就难免添许多麻烦；提高工作定额，就会使制定劳动力使用计划等工作发生困难，并且会使社员因为拚命干也完成不了定额而泄气；降低报酬标准，也不利于鼓舞社员的劳动积极性。
    究竟怎样叫“节约劳动日”，应该有个正确的看法。
    节约劳动日并不是越少用劳动日越好。
    节约劳动日，主要是说：要把劳动日用到最适当的地方；要把劳动日计算得正确合理。
    不要把同生产没有直接关系的事情（像演戏、扭秧歌舞、开党员团员会议等）也在合作社里记劳动日。
    不要在生产还没有比较多地提高的情况下，在并不急需的某些基本建设上（像修建大的办公室、大礼堂等等）用劳动日。
    要把农业副业生产和基本建设很好地全面安排，分出轻重缓急，排出先后次序，有计划地逐年地投入一定的劳动日。
    要给工作积极、有创造发明、提高了工作效率和产量的社员适当地多记劳动日。
    要给工作懒散、不顾工作质量、没有做够定额的社员合理地少记劳动日。
    要把工作报酬标准规定得合理，不要把比较简单的、比较轻的工作同比较复杂的、比较重的工作放在一个等级。
    要把包工方案制定得准确，精细地调查各个生产队的耕作区的土质、前茬作物、品种特性、使用的耕畜农具等，根据工作定额正确地计算所需要的劳动日数目。
    要帮助社员努力提高技术和改善劳动条件，以求逐步提高工作定额。
    要逐步尽可能地采用进步的农具和副业工具，以求用较少的劳动力得到较多的产品。
    要注意改进劳动组织，巩固劳动纪律，力求做到各尽所能。
    要尽一切可能增加合作社的总产量、总收入。
    只有这样，才是真正“节约劳动日”；才能把“提高每个劳动日的价值”和“增加每个社员的总收入”密切地结合起来。
    浙江省上虞县“三八”农业生产合作社，每亩田用十六个“工”的时候，粮食产量是四百斤，每个“工”合二十五斤；每亩田用二十二个“工”的时候，粮食产量增加到七百零三斤，每个“工”合三十多斤。可见多用了劳动日，每个劳动日的价值并不是一定要降低。再说，即使不是用二十二个“工”而是用了三十个“工”，虽然每个“工”的收入不到二十五斤了，但是每亩田比用十六个“工”的时候多打了三百多斤粮食，又有什么不好呢？
    河北省河间县“红星”农业生产合作社去年推行许多新的增产措施，多用了不少劳动日。分配的结果，每个劳动日合一点二二元；全县一般的社，每亩地所用劳动日没有“红星”社多，每个劳动日却只合一点一元左右。按每个劳动力的收入来说，“红星”社社员的收入就更多了，同全县一般社对比，这一年每个男劳动力多收入了50％，每个女劳动力多收入两倍多。
