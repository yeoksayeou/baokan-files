    The National Representative Conference of Family Members of Industrialists and Businessmen and Female Industrialists and Businessmen, convened to adapt to the deepening development of the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, concluded on the 6th of this month. The conference summarized the progress and achievements of women in industry and commerce over the past few years, conveyed and explained the specific policies of the Party and the state on enterprise reorganization, business management, personnel arrangements, and treatment in joint state-private enterprises, further clarifying the future for the representatives, dispelling their concerns, and strengthening their confidence in further accepting transformation. The representative conference also discussed the future tasks and directions of efforts for women in industry and commerce. It can be expected that this conference will further promote the enthusiasm and special role of women in industry and commerce across the country in the cause of socialist transformation.
    Family members of industrialists and businessmen and female industrialists and businessmen share common economic interests and the same ideological feelings with industrialists and businessmen. However, because they are women, especially the family members of industrialists and businessmen, who do not have truly equal status in family life, the political and cultural level of the vast majority of them is generally lower than that of male industrialists and businessmen, their understanding of the Party and the state's policies is less, and their doubts and concerns are often greater. This characteristic determines that we must provide them with more education to inspire and improve their enthusiasm and strive for them to become assistants in the socialist transformation work. This is not only necessary but also possible. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, through various social reform movements, especially in the socialist transformation movement, their ideological awareness has generally improved to varying degrees, and many activists have emerged. These activists not only are willing to accept socialist transformation themselves but also help their husbands and relatives break down their concerns and accept enterprise transformation and ideological transformation. Some actively arrange their housework to reduce the worries of their husbands or relatives when accepting socialist transformation; some also help and organize other women in industry and commerce to study policies. Their efforts are beneficial to the cause of socialist transformation. People from all walks of life in society should value and care about their positive performance and encourage them to further exert their positive role so that they can contribute more to the cause of socialist transformation. It is incorrect to fail to see their progressive side, fail to help them overcome their negative side, and ignore and underestimate their role.
    In which areas can women in industry and commerce strive to play a greater role in the future?
    First, women in industry and commerce must encourage their loved ones to further accept socialist transformation, actively assist the government in doing a good job in economic reorganization and enterprise transformation, overcome passive reliance, and ensure that their loved ones can be dutiful in their work positions after being assigned, learn socialist management methods, actively improve product quality, increase commodity types, and improve service attitudes. To achieve this, it is necessary to discover and dispel their own and their loved ones' ideological concerns in a timely and meticulous manner, rely on the strength of the collective to overcome difficulties, and run the enterprise well. This is the yardstick for measuring the work achievements of women in industry and commerce and is also the most basic task for women in industry and commerce.
    Second, family members of industrialists and businessmen should earnestly manage their household affairs. This not only can relieve their loved ones' worries in accepting transformation but also can promote and enhance their socialist enthusiasm. To manage household affairs well, one must have plans and arrangements for economic expenditures, be diligent and thrifty in managing the household, save unnecessary expenses, and live a good life; second, one must earnestly take responsibility for educating children, not spoiling or coddling them, and set a good example for them in all aspects, cultivating children to become physically and mentally healthy socialist citizens. In addition, it is also necessary to enhance unity among family members and neighbors, making the family a family that helps and encourages each other and makes progress together. Such a family can not only help loved ones better accept socialist transformation but is also what socialist society requires of every family.
    Third, women in industry and commerce must also strengthen learning, continuously improve their ideological awareness, cultivate labor viewpoints and labor habits, learn labor skills, and actively participate in social activities and social welfare undertakings. Women in industry and commerce need to expand their interests and horizons from the small scope of family life to social life, care about the major affairs of the collective, the major affairs of the country, and the major affairs of the world. They should understand the laws of social development through learning, understand the truth that labor creates the world, understand the policies and decrees of the Party and the government, cultivate the viewpoint of serving the people, strive to improve their political and cultural level, and cultivate labor habits and prepare for the conditions to participate in labor so that they can take up production, work, and learning positions according to the needs of the country and the people. At present, many family members of industrialists and businessmen have participated in street residential work or women's work, and some have even set up or jointly set up nurseries, kindergartens, and primary schools according to needs and possibilities to serve the working people and their children. These are all worthy of promotion and praise.
    Of course, there are many more things that women in industry and commerce can do and should do, but it is also necessary to take into account the different levels of awareness and various specific situations among them, and requirements should not be too high or too hasty. Even the main tasks mentioned above cannot be achieved by women in industry and commerce all at once, but should be done as much as possible first, and gradually seek full realization. All these tasks should be done by enlightening women in industry and commerce to do them consciously and voluntarily, and no coercive measures should be adopted. On the basis of their conscious willingness, they should also be carried out in an organized and guided manner. When organizing them to study or participate in social activities, it is necessary to take care of their time to manage household affairs.
    To do a good job in the work of women in industry and commerce and give full play to their role in socialist transformation, the Party's organizations at all levels must strengthen unified leadership. Local democratic women's federations, the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and other groups should also cooperate closely and act in unison. Leading organs at all levels should include the work of transforming women in industry and commerce in the overall plan for transforming capitalist industry and commerce, especially in the study plan for the ideological transformation of the bourgeoisie, and should regularly check and summarize the progress of this work. At the same time, Party organizations at all levels and relevant people's organizations should also plan to cultivate activists among women in industry and commerce, help them improve their ideological awareness and work ability, so that the ranks of activists will expand day by day, and through them, better unite women in industry and commerce and their relatives to move forward together and make greater contributions to the cause of socialist transformation.

### 充分发挥工商界妇女在社会主义改造中的积极作用

    充分发挥工商界妇女在社会主义改造中的积极作用
    为了适应工商业社会主义改造工作的深入开展而召开的全国工商业者家属和女工商业者代表会议，已经在本月六日闭幕了。这次会议总结了工商界妇女几年来的进步和成就，传达和解释了党和国家对公私合营企业的企业改组、经营管理、人事安排与待遇等等方面的具体政策，使代表们进一步认清了前途，解除了顾虑，加强了进一步接受改造的信心。代表会议还讨论了工商界妇女今后的任务和努力的方向。可以预计，通过这次会议必将进一步发挥全国工商界妇女在社会主义改造事业中的积极性和特殊作用。
    工商业者家属和女工商业者与工商业者有一致的经济利益和同样的思想感情。但是由于她们是妇女，特别是其中的工商业者家属，在家庭生活中并没有真正平等的地位，因此，她们之中绝大多数人的政治、文化水平一般比男工商业者要低，对党和国家的各项政策的了解比一般工商业者要少，怀疑与顾虑也往往更多。这个特点，就决定了我们必须对她们进行更多的教育来启发和提高她们的积极性，争取她们成为社会主义改造工作中的助力。这不但是必要的，而且是可能的。解放以来，工商界妇女在共产党和人民政府的领导下，经过各项社会改革运动，特别是在社会主义改造运动中，她们的思想觉悟已在不同程度上普遍有了提高，并且涌现了不少的积极分子。这些积极分子不但自己愿意接受社会主义改造，而且帮助丈夫和亲友打破顾虑，接受企业改造和思想改造。有的主动地把家务安排好来减少丈夫或亲属在接受社会主义改造时的后顾之忧；有的还帮助和组织其他工商界妇女学习政策。她们的这些努力，对于社会主义改造事业是有利的。社会上各阶层的人民应该重视和关心她们的这种积极表现，鼓励她们进一步发挥积极作用，使她们能为社会主义改造事业贡献出更多的力量。如果看不到她们进步的一面，不帮助她们克服消极的一面，忽视和轻视她们的作用，那是不正确的。
    今后工商界妇女能够从那些方面来努力发挥更大的作用呢？
    首先，工商界妇女必须鼓励亲人进一步接受社会主义改造，积极协助政府搞好经济改组和企业改造，克服消极依赖思想，使亲人在确定工作岗位以后能守职尽责，学习社会主义经营方法，积极提高产品质量，增加商品种类，改进服务态度。要做到这一点，就必须及时地、细致地发现和解除自己和亲人的思想顾虑，依靠集体的力量，克服困难，把企业搞好。这是测量工商界妇女的工作成绩的标尺，也是工商界妇女最基本的任务。
    其次，工商业者家属要认真搞好家务。这不仅能解除亲人在接受改造中的后顾之忧，而且能促进和提高他们的社会主义积极性。要搞好家务，一是要在经济开支上有计划、有安排，勤俭持家，节约不必要的开支，把生活过好；二是认真负起教养子女的责任，不溺爱、不娇纵，并在各方面给他们做出好的榜样，培养子女成为身心健康的社会主义的公民。除此以外，还要在家庭成员之间和邻里之间增进团结，使家庭成为互相帮助、互相勉励，共同进步的家庭。这样的家庭不仅仅可以帮助亲人更好地接受社会主义改造，而且也是社会主义社会对每个家庭的要求。
    第三、工商界妇女还必须加强学习，不断地提高思想觉悟，培养劳动观点和劳动习惯，学习劳动的技能，并积极参加社会活动和社会公益事业。工商界妇女需要把自己的兴趣和眼界，从家庭生活的小范围中扩大到社会生活中去，关心集体的大事、国家的大事和世界的大事。应该通过学习来认识社会发展的规律，懂得劳动创造世界的道理，明了党和政府的政策法令，培养为人民服务的观点，努力提高政治、文化水平，并培养劳动习惯和准备参加劳动的条件，以便根据国家和人民的需要，走上生产、工作和学习的岗位。现在已有不少的工商业者家属参加了街道居民工作或妇女工作，有的还根据需要与可能，自己举办或联合举办了托儿所、托儿站、幼儿园、小学校，为劳动人民及其子女服务，这些都是值得提倡和表扬的。
    当然，工商界妇女能做的和应该做的事情还很多，但是还必须照顾到她们当中不同的觉悟程度和各种具体情况，不能要求过高过急。即使是上面所提出的主要工作，对于工商界妇女来说，也不是一下子都能做到的，而应该是能做多少，先做多少，逐步地求得全部实现。所有的这些工作，都应该是启发工商界妇女自觉自愿地来做，不能采用任何强迫命令的办法。在她们自觉自愿的基础上，也还要有组织、有领导地来进行。在组织她们学习或参加社会活动的时候，必须照顾她们料理家务的时间。
    要做好工商界妇女工作，充分发挥她们在社会主义改造中的作用，还必须党的各级组织加强统一领导。各地民主妇女联合会、民主建国会、工商业联合会等团体也应该通力合作，一致行动。各级领导机关要把改造工商界妇女的工作，包括到改造资本主义工商业的工作的全面规划中去，特别是对资产阶级分子的思想改造的学习规划中去，并且要经常检查和总结这项工作进行的情况。同时，各级党的组织和各有关的人民团体，还要有计划地培养工商界妇女中的积极分子，帮助她们提高思想觉悟和工作能力，使积极分子的队伍日益扩大，并通过她们更好地团结工商界妇女和她们的亲人一同前进，为社会主义改造事业作出更大的贡献。
