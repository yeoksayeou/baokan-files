    Second National Higher Normal Education Conference
    Discusses Preliminary Twelve-Year Plan for Higher Normal Education
    The Second National Higher Normal Education Conference discussed the Twelve-Year Plan.
    The conference believes that higher normal education must consider its own development tasks from the scale and speed of secondary school development. According to the current need for teachers in secondary schools, the task of higher normal education is very arduous. It is necessary to consolidate existing higher normal schools and run them well. At the same time, it is necessary to implement the principle of self-reliance, give full play to the potential of existing schools, and actively tap the potential of local areas to complete the huge development tasks. In order to meet the needs of secondary school teachers in the next few years, a variety of transitional methods such as secondary school teacher training courses must be adopted in addition to the formal system.
    The conference believes that it is necessary to train and improve a large number of teachers in higher normal schools, step up the training of new forces, and expand the teaching staff. And actively improve the existing teachers.
    The conference believes that scientific research is an important item of higher normal school work. It plays an important role in improving teaching quality and cultivating and improving teachers. The conference clarified the direction of scientific research in higher normal schools, focusing on strengthening educational scientific research and studying important issues in the construction of general education and normal education, teaching methods, and theoretical and national economic construction issues in various sciences. The conference believes that compiling textbooks for higher normal schools should be listed as an important scientific research work. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    第二次全国高等师范教育会议
    讨论高等师范教育十二年初步规划
    第二次全国高等师范教育会议讨论了十二年规划。
    会议认为，高等师范教育必须从中等学校发展的规模和速度来考虑自己发展的任务。按当前中等学校发展的师资的需要，高等师范教育的任务是十分艰巨的。必须巩固现有的高等师范学校，并把它们办好，同时，贯彻自力更生的原则，充分发挥现有学校的潜力，积极挖掘地方的潜力来完成巨大的发展任务。为了满足今后若干年内中等学校师资的需要，在正规制度外还必须采取中学师资短训班等多种多样过渡性的办法。
    会议认为，必须大量培养和提高高等师范学校的师资，加紧培养新生力量，扩大教师队伍。并积极提高现有师资。
    会议认为科学研究工作是高等师范学校工作的一个重要项目。它对提高教学质量和培养提高师资起着重要的作用。会议明确了高等师范学校科学研究的方向，着重提出加强教育科学研究工作和研究普通教育、师范教育建设中的重要问题，教学方法问题，各门科学中理论性的和有关国家经济建设的问题。会议认为应该把编写高等师范学校教科书列为一项重要的科学研究工作。　（据新华社讯）
