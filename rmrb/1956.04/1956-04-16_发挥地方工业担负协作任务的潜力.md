Unleash the Potential of Local Industry to Undertake Collaborative Tasks
    Ding Wei

Since the beginning of this year, the collaborative relationship between local industries in Shenyang and state-owned industries has been worse than last year. This is manifested in three aspects: First, this year the production tasks of local industries have increased significantly, especially for machinery factories. The central allocation of double-wheeled double-shared plows alone reached 230,000 units, and the output in the first quarter of this year was 195% of the same period last year. After the task increased, many factories were only willing to accept large-scale production tasks in whole batches, and were unwilling to accept small-batch, piecemeal collaborative tasks. Second, after many private factories undertaking collaborative tasks for state-owned factories were converted into joint state-private enterprises, the relevant units did not take into account the original collaborative relationships in the overall planning of production, and many original collaborative relationships were interrupted. Shenyang Transformer Factory originally had 120 private factories collaborating with it, but now there is not a single one. The original private Sanjucheng Iron Factory made air cylinders for the low-voltage switch factory, and the quality was very good. However, after the joint state-private operation, it was arranged to produce ordinary transport machine parts. Third, after many private factories with collaborative tasks implemented joint state-private ownership, the quality of their products declined. For example, at the Guotai Factory, which processed buttons for the low-voltage switch factory, the scrap rate increased from 30% to 70% after the joint state-private operation.

This year, the tasks of state-owned factories have increased, and local industries need to undertake more collaborative tasks. However, many local factories are unwilling to sign collaboration contracts with state-owned factories. There are still 120 contracts that have been delayed, and the contracts that have been signed are not being well implemented. According to statistics from the nine professional companies of the Shenyang Municipal First Industrial Bureau, 41% of the collaborative tasks were not delivered on time in the first quarter. Some new product trial production tasks of the state-owned Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory were also unable to be completed because the required castings could not be found for collaboration.

The objective reason for the poor performance of local industrial collaboration in Shenyang is that the collaborative plans of many state-owned factories have been delayed, and there is no long-term and fixed collaborative plan, which increases difficulties for the collaborating local industries. However, the main reason is that some leaders of local industrial enterprises believe that the production tasks have increased this year and the difficulties have decreased, so they emphasize that the enterprise's production capacity is insufficient, and they are not actively accepting collaborative tasks, even treating collaborative tasks as an extra burden, and trying to push them out as much as possible. In fact, the equipment utilization rate of general local factories has not exceeded 60%. As long as there is planned arrangement and active exploration of the enterprise's potential, it is entirely possible to strive to complete more collaborative tasks. The key lies in criticizing and overcoming the unwillingness to collaborate among the leaders of local industrial enterprises. Recently, the Shenyang Municipal Production Collaboration Committee has taken measures to require local industries to actively restore the original collaborative relationships and not to consider their own specialties in isolation. All products that can be made must be actively undertaken to maximize the needs of state-owned industries. At the same time, Shenyang City will also organize one or several local industrial factories to establish a relatively fixed collaborative relationship with one or several state-owned factories, so that local industrial enterprises can better meet the needs of state-owned factories, and at the same time, factories undertaking collaborative tasks can gradually become specialized.

    发挥地方工业担负协作任务的潜力
    丁为
    今年以来，沈阳地方工业同国营工业的协作关系不如去年了。这表现在三个方面：一、今年地方工业生产任务大量增加了，特别是机械工厂，仅中央调拨的双轮双铧犁即达二十三万台，今年一季度的产量为去年同期的195％。任务增加以后，许多工厂便只愿意接受整批的大宗的生产任务，而不愿接受小批零星的协作任务。二、许多为国营工厂担负协作任务的私营工厂公私合营后，有关单位在统筹安排生产中，没很好考虑原来的协作关系，许多原有的协作关系都中断了。沈阳变压器厂原有120个私营厂为它协作，现在一个也没有了。原私营三聚诚铁工厂为低压开关厂做气缸，质量也很好，公私合营后，却被安排生产普通的运输机部件去了。三、许多有协作任务的私营工厂实行公私合营后，产品质量下降了。如为低压开关厂加工电钮的国泰工厂，公私合营后废品率由30％上升到70％。
    今年，国营工厂的任务增加了，需要地方工业担负更多的协作任务。但是，许多地方工厂都不愿跟国营工厂订协作合同。现在还有120份合同迟迟订不下来，已经订的合同也执行得不好。据沈阳市第一工业局九个专业公司统计，第一季度有41％的协作任务没按合同期限交货。国营沈阳第二机床厂有几种新产品试制任务，也因为所需要的铸件找不到协作对象而完不成。
    沈阳市地方工业协作工作做得不好的客观原因，是许多国营工厂协作计划迟迟订不下来，没有较长期较固定的协作计划，因而给协作的地方工业增加困难。但是主要的是，有些地方工厂的领导人员认为今年的生产任务多了，困难小了，就强调企业生产能力不足，不积极接受协作任务，甚至把协作任务当作额外负担，能推出去的就尽量推。事实上，一般的地方工厂的设备运用率都没超过60％，只要有计划地安排，积极挖掘企业的潜力，争取完成更多的协作任务是完全可能的。关键在于批判和克服地方工业企业领导人员的不愿协作的思想。最近沈阳市生产协作委员会采取了措施，要求地方工业积极恢复原有的协作关系，不要孤立考虑自己的专业。凡是能够做的产品都要积极承揽，要最大限度地满足国营工业的需要。同时，沈阳市还将分别组织一个或几个地方工业工厂同一个或几个国营工厂建立较为固定的协作关系，以便地方工业企业更好地满足国营工厂的需要，同时也可以使承担协作任务的工厂逐步走上专业化。
