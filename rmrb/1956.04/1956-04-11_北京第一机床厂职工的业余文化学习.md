    Amateur Cultural Learning for Workers at Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant
    Jisi
    Since its establishment in the winter of 1951, the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant's amateur cultural and technical school has persisted in teaching, except for a period of suspension during the "Three-Anti" movement. Over the past four years, the number of workers enrolled has steadily increased, and their cultural level has greatly improved. In 1951, only 30.7% of the plant's workers participated in amateur cultural and technical learning, with the majority (about 62.3%) attending elementary school classes. Workers with a junior high school education or above accounted for only 20%. Now, the number of enrolled workers has reached 61.5% of the plant's total workforce, representing 87.8% of those who should participate in cultural learning. Among them, elementary school classes account for only 11.1%, junior high school classes have risen to 83.1%, and workers with a junior high school education or above account for 43% of the plant's total workforce. In addition, many workers have participated in amateur intermediate technical schools and basic knowledge training classes. Due to the continuous improvement of the cultural and technical level of the plant's workers, their production techniques have been continuously improved. After learning about the geometric principle of axial symmetry, some workers quickly applied this knowledge to adjusting machine tool cutter chucks, improving production efficiency and reducing production waste.
    The persistence and achievements of the amateur cultural and technical learning at the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant are inseparable from the close care of the Party and the attention of the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations. The plant's Party organization, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League have consistently regarded the earnest organization of workers to study cultural and technical knowledge as an extremely important task. They not only assigned dedicated personnel to participate in the leadership of the amateur school but also took responsibility for other specific work, providing necessary support and assistance in terms of funding, teaching equipment, and teaching organization. In short, they did everything possible to meet the learning needs of the vast majority of workers. They also developed comprehensive plans for the scale and progress of workers' amateur cultural and technical learning based on production needs and other objective conditions, providing a framework for the work. For example, the new plan requires the completion of literacy and elementary school class teaching tasks by 1956, and the improvement of the cultural level of general production workers to the junior high school graduation level by 1959. It also requires raising some lower-level technicians to the level equivalent to graduates of secondary technical schools.
    Fully guaranteeing the time for workers' amateur cultural and technical learning is an important issue to ensure the normal development of such learning. In the past, the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant had too many meetings, and active elements held too many concurrent positions, which not only squeezed out workers' amateur learning time and affected their normal life order but also sometimes hindered production. To solve this problem, the plant adjusted the production and amateur activity time for workers twice in 1955, systematically reduced meetings, reduced the concurrent positions held by active elements, and increased the time for workers to study culture and technology. Now, except for two days a week when amateur time is used for Party and mass activities, the other four days are used for cultural and technical learning. Party and mass activities generally last for one or two hours each time, and individual meetings, such as branch meetings, do not exceed two and a half hours at most. This allows workers to concentrate on allocating and using one day's time, starting work at 7:00 am, taking a one-hour lunch break, and finishing work at 4:00 pm. From 4:45 pm to 7:10 pm, workers are organized to participate in amateur cultural and technical learning on a fixed basis. After 7:10 pm, workers can leave the classroom on time to go home.
    Improving workers' learning conditions is also an important issue. The Party organization and administration of the plant are very concerned about this issue. On the one hand, they help teachers improve their teaching, and on the other hand, they encourage workers participating in learning to study actively. At the same time, they also pay attention to improving workers' learning conditions in all aspects. In the past, the class arrangement was not detailed enough, and the level of each class was uneven, which affected both the teaching progress of the teachers and the overall learning progress, as well as the learning enthusiasm of the students. After discovering this problem, the Party organization and administration studied and solved the problem of organizing workers into classes, so that the level of students in the same class was generally consistent, and the time and administrative organization of the study classes and production shifts could be appropriately linked. Now, classes are generally organized separately by course (e.g., if a worker's language level reaches junior high school, they are assigned to the junior high school language class to learn language, but if their mathematics level is only at the higher elementary school level, they are assigned to the higher elementary school class to learn mathematics), and study classes are organized according to the production shift order. For the convenience of teaching, some classes with too few students and class times that are not far apart are appropriately merged together, which ensures the progress and effectiveness of learning.
    With the increase in the number of students, in addition to assigning full-time teachers, the plant has also hired some part-time teachers from intellectuals within the plant and unemployed intellectuals in society (including housewives from intellectual families) to supplement the shortage of teachers in the amateur cultural and technical school. In order to ensure the quality of teaching, part-time teachers hired from society are assigned appropriate courses so that they can receive treatment equivalent to that of teachers of the same grade in regular schools, allowing them to concentrate on teaching. They are also organized to prepare lessons carefully and urged to revise assignments conscientiously. Cadres within the plant who are hired to teach part-time are guaranteed a certain amount of lesson preparation time and are paid according to the number of class hours taught. In addition, attention is also paid to the political and ideological guidance of teachers, teaching is carefully inspected, those who have achieved success in teaching are praised and given necessary material rewards, and those who have shortcomings in teaching work are also appropriately criticized and helped. The four female teachers who were hired to the plant when the amateur cultural and technical school was established in 1951 were trained in such an environment. Now they have all become full-time teachers with relatively successful teaching work.

    北京第一机床厂职工的业余文化学习
    集思
    北京第一机床厂职工业余文化技术学校，自1951年冬季创办以来，除“三反”运动时期曾一度停课以外，一直坚持了教学工作。在四年多的时间内，职工入学人数日渐增多，职工的文化水平也有了很大提高。在1951年，全厂只有30.7％的职工参加业余文化技术学习，绝大部分读的是初小班，约占62.3％，初中以上文化程度的职工仅占20％。现在，入学人数已经达到了全厂职工总数的61.5％，占应参加文化学习职工的87.8％，其中，初小班只占11.1％，初中班上升到83.1％，初中以上程度的职工占全厂职工总数的43％。同时，还有不少职工参加了业余中级技术学校、业余基础知识训练班学习。由于全厂职工的文化技术水平不断提高，职工们的生产技术不断地得到改进。有的职工学习了几何中轴对称知识以后，很快地把这些知识运用到调整机床刀具卡活上，提高了生产效率，减少了生产废品。
    第一机床厂的职工业余文化技术学习能够坚持下来，并且获得成绩，是和党的密切关怀，和行政、工会、青年团组织的重视分不开的。厂的党组织、行政、工会和青年团一直把认真组织职工学习文化技术知识当作一项极其重要的任务来完成。他们不仅抽出专人参加业余学校的领导工作，而且分别负责业余学校的其他具体工作，在经费、教学设备、教学组织等方面给予必要的支持和帮助。总之，尽一切可能满足广大职工学习文化技术知识的要求。他们还根据生产的需要和其它客观条件，作出职工业余文化技术学习的规模和进度的全面规划，使工作有所遵循。例如在新的规划中，要求在1956年完成扫除文盲和初小班的教学任务，到1959年将一般参加生产的职工的文化水平提高到初中毕业程度。要求将一部分低级技工提高到相当于中等技术学校毕业生的水平。
    充分保证职工业余文化技术学习的时间，是保证职工业余文化技术学习正常开展的一个重要的问题。过去，第一机床厂会议多，积极分子的兼职也多，不仅挤掉了职工的业余学习时间，影响了职工的正常生活秩序，而且有时也妨害了生产。为了解决这个问题，该厂在1955年曾两次调整了职工生产和业余活动时间，有计划地精减了会议，减少了积极分子的兼职，增加了职工学习文化技术的时间。现在一周除了只有两天的业余时间用作党群活动外，其他四天的业余时间都用作文化技术学习。党群活动每次一般为一、二小时，个别的会议，如支部大会至多也不超过两个半小时。这样可以使职工集中地分配使用一天的时间，每天早上七时上班，中午休息一小时，下午四时下班。下午四时四十五分到七时十分固定地组织职工参加业余文化技术学习。七时十分以后，职工可以准时离开课堂回家。
    改善职工的学习条件，也是一个重要的问题。该厂的党组织和行政方面非常关心这个问题。他们一方面帮助教师改进教学，一方面鼓励参加学习的职工积极学习。同时还注意从各方面改善职工的学习条件。过去编班不细致，各班程度不齐，既影响了教师教学和总的学习进度，也影响了学员的学习情绪。发现这个问题以后，党组织和行政就研究解决组织职工学习班次的问题，既使同班学习学员的程度大体整齐，又使学习班次和生产班次的时间和行政组织能适当衔接。现在，一般都以课程为单位分别编班（如某一职工语文达到初中程度，便编入初中语文班学语文，数学只有高小程度，便编入高小班学数学），并且以生产轮班顺序组织学习班次，为了教学上的方便，又将一些班次人数太少、上课时间相距不远的班次适当合并在一起，这就保证了学习进度和学习效果。
    随着学员人数的增加，该厂除配备专职教员外，还从厂内和社会失业的知识分子（包括知识分子出身的家庭妇女）中，聘请了一些兼职教员，以补业余文化技术学校教员的不足。为了保证教学质量，对于从社会上聘请的兼职教员，分配给他们适当的课程，使他们能得到相当于正规学校同等级教员的待遇，让他们安心教学，并且组织他们认真备课，督促他们认真修改作业。对聘请兼课的厂内干部则保证给予一定的备课时间，并且按上课时数给予报酬。此外，还注意了对教师们的政治思想指导，认真进行教学检查，对教学方面有成绩的给予表扬和必要的物质奖励，对于教学工作中有缺点的也适当给予批评和帮助。1951年创办业余文化技术学校的时候聘请到厂的四位女教师，就是在这样的环境中锻炼出来的。现在她们都成为教学工作中比较有成绩的专任教师。
