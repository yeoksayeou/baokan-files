Shandong Fishery Cooperatives Launch Competition

More than 780 fishery production cooperatives in Shandong Province have participated in a fishery production increase competition. Most fishery production cooperatives have revised their production increase plans and have started spring fishing production ten to twenty days ahead of schedule. The seine fishing boats of Changshan Island all went to sea in early March, catching more than 450,000 jin of fish in just over ten days. The fishery production cooperatives of Jimo County harvested more than 2.5 million jin of fish and shrimp in early spring.

    山东渔业合作社开展竞赛
    山东省有七百八十多个渔业生产合作社参加了渔业增产竞赛运动。大部分渔业生产合作社都修订了增产计划，并且提前十天到二十天左右投入了春汛生产。长山岛的拉网渔船，早在三月上旬就全部出海，十多天中捕鱼四十五万多斤。即墨县的渔业生产合作社早春捕捞的鱼虾有二百五十多万斤。
