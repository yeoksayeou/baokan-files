To the Editor:

    The slogan "March towards science" has inspired intellectuals throughout the scientific and technological community. They have all formulated plans to catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels. However, some engineers who have been promoted from workers are still illiterate or semi-illiterate due to the long-term lack of opportunities to study culture; they do not know how to improve themselves and feel very distressed.

    For example, Liu Runzhi (Communist Party member), a drilling engineer at the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, is 47 years old and has more than 30 years of service. He has rich practical experience and strong working ability; however, his cultural level is very low, and even signing his name is difficult, let alone listening to reports and taking notes. He cannot elevate many of the things he can do to theoretical analysis to explain scientific principles. Because there are few drilling engineers in North China, his workload is heavy, and he cannot leave his post for study. He said distressingly, "I can still do it now, but if this continues, I won't be able to do it in the future."

    Although there are not many people like Liu Runzhi, they are all new types of technical personnel who have grown up from the working people, have firm positions, rich practical experience, and the habit of studying diligently. Therefore, how to quickly improve their cultural level is a problem worthy of attention. Relevant departments should study this issue: if conditions permit, they should be transferred to study in a centralized manner; otherwise, they can designate someone to teach them culture and help them formulate a relatively systematic and practical advanced study plan, and then equip them with an excellent young technician to sign a contract with them to learn from each other. Only in this way can these old engineers with low cultural levels also march towards science and better play their role in the construction of the motherland.

### 从工人中提升的工程师希望提高文化水平

    从工人中提升的工程师希望提高文化水平编辑同志：
    “向科学进军”的口号，鼓舞了整个科学技术界的知识分子。他们纷纷制定规划，争取赶上世界先进科学的水平。但是，有一部分从工人中提拔起来的工程师，由于长期没有学习文化的机会，直到现在还是文盲或半文盲；他们不知道怎样来提高自己，感到非常苦闷。
    例如，华北煤田地质勘探局钻探工程师刘润芝（共产党员），今年47岁，有30多年的工龄。他的实际经验很丰富，工作能力也很强；但是，他的文化水平很低，连签名都很费劲，更不用说听报告记笔记了。他对于许多自己能够做的事情，不能提高到理论上来分析，说明科学道理。因为华北的钻探工程师很少，他的工作任务很重，不能离职学习。他苦闷地说：“现在我还可以干，这样下去，以后就干不了了。”
    像刘润芝这样的人，数量虽然不太多；但是，他们都是从劳动人民中生长起来的、立场坚定的、具有丰富的实际经验和刻苦钻研的习惯的新型技术人员。因此，如何迅速提高他们的文化水平，是一个值得重视的问题。有关部门应该研究一下这个问题：在条件许可的情况下，应该抽调他们集中学习；否则，可以指定专人教他们学习文化，并且帮助他们制定比较系统又结合实际的进修计划，再配备一个优秀的青年技术人员同他们订立合同，互相学习。这样，才能使这些文化水平低的老工程师也能向科学进军，在祖国建设中更好地发挥作用。
