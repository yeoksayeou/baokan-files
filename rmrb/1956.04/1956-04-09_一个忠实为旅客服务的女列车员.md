    A Female Train Conductor Faithfully Serving Passengers
    Feng Ying
    Two years ago, Luo Qinming graduated from junior high school. The school encouraged students to participate in various jobs after graduation and assigned Xiao Luo to the Jiang'an Train Section to work as a train conductor.

    “A train conductor?” This was something she had never considered before. “Sweeping floors, emptying spittoons, wiping windows…” Her mind was in turmoil. She thought a lot: "Some classmates went on to higher education, some went to participate in the vigorous construction, but I became a train conductor. How embarrassing would it be for teachers and classmates to see me! In a few years, other classmates can become labor heroes, completing several years' worth of production tasks in one year. A train conductor wouldn't sweep two years' worth of floors or empty three years' worth of spittoons in one year, would they!..."

    She thought about herself, thought about the country, thought about various experiences from small to large and pleasant things. She couldn't calm down for a moment. She suddenly remembered the oath she took when joining the Communist Youth League: "Serve the people wholeheartedly and play an exemplary role in various jobs." She asked herself: "Is this just empty talk? Didn't it come from my own mouth? Since this oath of loyalty to the Party and the country was said by myself, I should fulfill it. Youth League members should obey the school's assignment and go to places where the motherland needs them." Thinking of this, she became clear-headed!

    "Xiao Luo, is being a train conductor really your ideal?" Her classmates asked curiously after learning that Xiao Luo had decided to become a train conductor.

    "Yes, I will always be a train conductor."

    "What a common job! It will wear out your youth and hopes on the train!" One classmate disapproved.

    "Serving hundreds of people every day on the train, although ordinary, is also enjoyable." Xiao Luo was a tenacious girl, and she never wavered once she made a decision. She answered everyone's questions decisively.

    "Go ahead, you'll regret it!"

    "No, I'll be happy," Xiao Luo said firmly.

    The train departed from Hankou! This was an express train bound for Beijing. Tall buildings, fertile fields, and a continuous panorama of rural harvest scenes sped past Luo Qinming's eyes. She felt that this job was very interesting. Wouldn't she be able to travel all over the country!

    However, when she picked up the broom, she felt a little embarrassed. Her face turned red, and she didn't dare to raise her head. She was afraid of running into acquaintances, especially teachers and classmates. After a while, she thought again: What's there to be afraid of? This is also work! If no one becomes a train conductor, who will take care of the tens of thousands of passengers! So she gently started sweeping the floor.

    "Comrade, what time do we arrive in Zhengzhou? What time does the train to Xi'an leave?" Luo Qinming looked up, and a passenger asking a question was already standing in front of her. Her heart started pounding! She had only studied for three days at the train section before starting work, and she wasn't familiar with anything. She wanted to say she didn't know, but she was afraid of causing a lot of laughter; she wanted to say something, but what could she say when she really didn't know. She hesitated for a moment and said: "I'm sorry, I just started this job. Can you please ask our train conductor?"

    "Okay, okay, it's okay." The passenger was still very polite. Unexpectedly, no one in the carriage laughed at her. She thought, in the past, she had been too sensitive. In fact, no one looked down on train conductors, and they all respected them very much. When she needed to announce travel precautions in the carriage, the difficulty came again. All the passengers were looking at her, and her face turned red. Her throat also wouldn't obey, as if something was blocking her throat. What to do? She used her break time to stand alone in an empty carriage and speak loudly, practicing in front of the mirror. To master professional knowledge, she wrote down local places of interest, specialties, station names along the route, departure times, transfer locations, and general knowledge in a special notebook. During her rest, she memorized them little by little. At this time, she deeply realized that a train conductor not only sweeps floors, scrubs toilets, and empties spittoons, but also needs to know a lot of knowledge to serve passengers well. Every time she went on a trip, she wiped the window glass until it was bright and clean. She often took advantage of the opportunity when passengers went to the toilet or when the train stopped for a long time to sweep the floor and wipe the floor. This way, not only was the cleaning detailed, but it didn't disturb the passengers' rest. She did everything she could to provide convenience to the passengers, wiping the room until there was no dust, and scrubbing the toilets until they were clean and white.

    One day, a pregnant woman boarded the train from Xuchang Station. After a while, her stomach started to hurt, and it looked like she was going to give birth. Luo Qinming panicked. She went to find the medic, who said she didn't know how to deliver a baby. She went to find the train conductor, who also said there was nothing she could do. None of the passengers knew how to deliver a baby either. In the carriage, everyone was worried about the pregnant woman, asking questions. In middle school, Xiao Luo had learned physiology and hygiene, but how could that work? Textbook knowledge is different from reality, and she had never seen such a thing before, how could she do it! She paced back and forth in the carriage anxiously. She thought: These are two lives! The pregnant woman cried out again! Xiao Luo and the train conductor immediately helped her into a private room. Xiao Luo said firmly: "Prepare gauze, scissors, cotton wool."

    "What are you busy with? We haven't found anyone to deliver the baby yet," the medic said.

    "I'll do it! We can't just watch someone die without helping, we have to be responsible to the passengers, we have to be responsible to the child."

    "You?" the medic asked in surprise.

    "It's me, prepare quickly, don't forget to disinfect!" She wiped her sweat while rolling up her sleeves.

    An hour later, the cry of a baby was heard in the carriage, and the passengers cheered. Everyone congratulated the mother. At this time, before Xiao Luo could wash her hands, some passengers came to shake her hand, praising her for her bravery. But, to be honest, she was so scared at this time that she almost cried, and sweat had soaked her shirt.

    From then on, Xiao Luo increasingly felt that the work of a train conductor was important. She liked the passengers, and the passengers also liked her. She had encountered some train conductors arguing with passengers, so she discussed with the train conductors and proposed guarantees of enthusiastically taking care of passengers, patiently answering questions, and humbly accepting criticism and suggestions. When she saw many elderly people having difficulty walking and women and children having difficulty getting on and off the train, she thought about how difficult it was for these people to travel and that they needed special care. Therefore, she and the train conductors discussed and proposed to make the elderly, women, children, veterans, and sick people the focus of care. They would help them get on the train, get off the train, and leave the station, and they would send them water, food, help them carry things, and hold children on the train. Sometimes, there were too many people who needed this kind of care, so she selected enthusiastic passengers to help with the care, doing everything possible to make everyone comfortable and happy, so that the passengers felt like they were at home on the train.

    Luo Qinming faithfully served the passengers, treating the elderly as her own parents and her peers as brothers and sisters. In the past two years, she had not had a single injury or accident while on duty. The train had received more than 370 letters of appreciation praising her. The letter writers included workers, soldiers, and elderly people; the forms of writing included poems and clapper rhymes. The mother of the hero and martyr Huang Jiguang said to Xiao Luo: "You are really a good child, taking care of me so meticulously, just like my own daughter." A junior high school student in Wuhan studied her deeds and wrote a poem: "We face this girl, life has stirred up ocean-like waves, classmates! Live and study, let us be like her..."

    In March of this year, Luo Qinming was selected as a representative to attend the National Railway Advanced Workers Congress. She stood at the window of the dormitory and looked into the distance. She held two letters in her hand, one from Guangxi and one from a remote village. She opened the first letter, which was written by all the students of the Dong Cunrui Class of a middle school in Guangxi. They said that they would learn from her. The second letter began with: "Qinming daughter." Who sent this? Xiao Luo couldn't guess. She looked carefully and realized that it was an old army dependent. She wrote many words of thanks in the letter. Finally, the old lady said: "I am a person without a daughter, you have treated me too well, making me unable to forget it, be my daughter!" Luo Qinming was moved! Her mother had died very early, but in her work, she had met so many kind mothers, and also the mother of the hero Huang Jiguang. A string of tears flowed down her rosy face! She felt so happy, this was the real life!

    "What a common job! It will wear out your youth and hopes on the train!" She thought of a classmate's words. But life told her that youth and hope had not disappeared, but radiated a brilliant light on the train. If she were with her classmates now and asked them to look at the letters in her hand, they would know how valuable and important the work of a train conductor is! (Attached picture)

    一个忠实为旅客服务的女列车员
    冯影
    前年，骆琴明在初中毕业了。学校里动员同学们毕业之后尽可能去参加各种工作，同时把小骆分配到江岸列车段，叫她去当列车员。
      “做列车员？”这是她过去没有想过的事。“天天扫地，倒痰盂，擦玻璃……”她心里乱得很。她想的很多：“同学们有的升学了，有的去参加轰轰烈烈的建设，自己却当了列车员，老师和同学看见多丢人！几年以后，别的同学可以当劳动英雄，一年能完成几年的生产任务，列车员总不会一年扫两年的地、倒第三年的痰盂吧！……”。
    她想想个人、想想国家，想到由小到大的各种经历和令人愉快的事情，她一刻也不能安静下来。她猛然想起了入团时候的宣誓：“全心全意为人民服务，在各种工作岗位上起模范作用。”她自问了一句：“这是一句空话吗？不是从自己嘴里说出去的吗？这种对党、对国家忠诚的誓言既然是自己说的就应该履行。青年团员应该服从学校的分配到祖国需要的地方去。”想到这里，她清醒了！
    “小骆，你的理想真是当列车员吗？”同学们知道小骆下决心当列车员以后奇怪地问。
      “真的，永远做个列车员。”
      “多平凡的工作！把青春和希望都消磨在列车上了！”有个同学不赞成地说。
      “在车上天天为几百人服务，虽然平凡也是愉快的。”小骆是个顽强的姑娘，决定的事从来不三心二意，她果断地回答了大家的疑问。
      “去吧，你会后悔的！”
    “不，我会高兴的。”小骆坚定地说道。
    列车从汉口出发了！这是直通北京的快车。高大的楼房、肥沃的田野、一片连一片的农村的丰收景象，在骆琴明眼前飞驶过去。她觉得做这个工作很有意思，这不是可以跑遍全国吗！
    但是，当她拿起扫帚，就觉得有点不好意思了。她的脸红了，不敢把头抬起来。她怕碰上熟人，特别怕碰上老师和同学们。过了一会，她又想：碰上怕啥，这也是工作啊！如果谁都不做列车员，谁来照顾成千上万的旅客呢！于是她就轻轻的扫起地来了。
      “同志，到郑州几点钟，去西安的车什么时间开？”小骆抬起头来，问事的一位旅客已经站在她的面前。她心跳起来了！她到列车段才学习三天就上车工作，一点情况都不熟。有心说不知道，怕引起很多人大笑；想说，说什么呢，自己确实不知道。她躇踌一下说：“对不起，我刚开始做这工作，请问我们的车长好么！”
    “好，好，没关系。”旅客仍然很客气。出乎意料以外，车厢里也没一个人笑话自己。她想，过去自己太多心了，其实谁也没小看列车员，而且都非常尊重列车员。她要在车内通报旅途注意事项的时候，困难又来了。所有的旅客都看着她，她的脸红了。嗓子也不听使唤，总像有什么东西堵着嗓门似的。怎么办呢？她就利用休班时间，一个人站在空车里大声讲话，对着镜子练习。为了掌握业务知识，她把各地名胜古迹、特产、沿途车站站名、开车时间、换车地点及一般常识等，都记在一个专用本子上。休息的时候，就一点点背诵。这时她深深体会到列车员不但是扫地、刷厕所、倒痰盂，并且还要懂得很多知识，才能很好地为旅客服务。每次出车的时候，她都把玻璃窗擦得通亮，经常利用旅客上厕所或停车时间长的机会，扫地、擦地板。这样不但清扫的细致，又不扰乱旅客休息。她尽一切力量给旅客方便，把屋里擦得一点灰尘都没有，厕所也刷得白白净净。
    一天，从许昌车站上来一位孕妇，不一会她肚子疼起来，看样子要生小孩。骆琴明慌了。她去找卫生员，卫生员说不会接生。她又去找车长，车长也说没办法。旅客中也没有一个会接生的。车里，所有的人都为孕妇着急，问长问短。在中学的时候，小骆曾学过生理卫生，但是怎么能行呢？书本知识和实际不一样，而自己又没见过这样的事，怎么能下得手呢！她急的在车里转来转去，她想：这是两条性命啊！孕妇又叫起来了！小骆和车长立刻把她扶到一间包房里。小骆坚定地叫道：“准备纱布，剪刀，药棉。”
      “忙啥？接生人还没找到呢。”卫生员说。
      “我来动手！不能见死不救，要对旅客负责，要对孩子负责。”
      “你？”卫生员惊奇地问。
    “是我，快准备吧，别忘了消毒！”她一边擦着汗，一边卷起袖子。
    一小时以后，一个婴儿的哭声传到了车厢里，旅客们都欢腾起来，大家同声向产妇祝贺。这时候，还没等小骆洗手，有的旅客就来同她握手，表扬她勇敢。但是，说实在的，这时候她吓得快要哭了，汗水已经把她的衬衣湿透。
    从此，小骆越来越感到列车员的工作重要了。她喜欢旅客，旅客们也喜欢她。她曾遇到有些列车员和旅客吵嘴，她就同列车员们研究，提出了热心照顾旅客、耐心解答问题、虚心接受批评和建议的保证。当她在车上看到很多老年人走路那么困难、妇女和孩子上下车很吃力时，就想到这些人出门多么不易，需要特别关怀和照顾。于是，她同列车员们一起研究，提出把老人、妇女、小孩、荣军和有病的人，作为重点照顾的对象。要把他们送上车、送下车、送出站，在车上给他们送水、送饭，帮助他们拿东西、抱小孩。有时候，需要这种照顾的人太多了，她就挑选出热心的旅客帮助照顾，尽一切力量使人人舒适，快乐，使旅客们在列车上有像呆在家里一样的感觉。
    骆琴明忠实地为旅客服务着，把老年人看成是自己的父母，把同辈人看成是兄弟姐妹。两年多来，她在乘务中没发生一件伤病事故。这个列车上曾经收到过三百七十多件表扬她的感谢信。写信的人有工人，有战士，有年迈苍苍的老人；写信的形式有诗歌，有快板。英雄烈士黄继光的母亲对小骆说：“你真是个好孩子，照顾我无微不至，和我的女儿一样。”武汉市一个初中学生学习了她的事迹，特意写了一首诗：“我们面对着这位姑娘，生活激起了海洋般的波浪，同学们！生活和学习吧，让我们和她一样……”
    今年三月，骆琴明被选为出席全国铁路先进工作者代表大会的代表。她站在宿舍的窗前向远处眺望。她手中拿着两封信，一封信是从广西寄来的，一封信是从遥远的乡村来的。她拆开第一封信是广西中学董存瑞班全体同学写来的，他们表示要向她学习。第二封信开头是：“琴明女儿”这是谁寄来的，小骆猜不到了。她仔细看下去，才知道是一位军属老大娘，她在信中写了很多感谢话，最后这位老大娘说：“我是没有女儿的人，你待我太好了，使我老也忘不掉，做我的女儿吧！”骆琴明感动了！她很早就死了母亲，但是在工作中遇到了这么多善良的母亲，而且有英雄黄继光的母亲。一串泪珠从她红扑扑的脸上淌下来！她感到自己是多么幸福啊，这才是真正的生活呢！
    “多平凡的工作！把青春和希望都消磨在列车上了！”她想起同学的一句话。但是，生活告诉她，青春和希望不但没有消失，而且在列车上放射出灿烂的光辉。如果现在和同学们在一起，叫他们看看手中的信，就会知道列车员是多么可贵的、多么重要的工作了！（附图片）
