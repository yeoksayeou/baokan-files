Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: TASS reports that Khrushchev delivered a long speech at the All-Soviet Conference of Young Construction Workers on April 11. In his speech, he highly praised the work of Soviet youth and put forward significant tasks for the Soviet Communist Youth League members and all young people.

Khrushchev said that the Communist Youth League has always been a loyal assistant and a powerful reserve force of our Party, both in the past and present. The Communist Youth League has consistently responded enthusiastically to all measures taken by the Party, bravely stepping onto the most responsible and arduous fighting posts, and gloriously fulfilling its responsibilities to the motherland. At the 20th Party Congress, the Party expressed its gratitude for the youth's response to the call and their selfless labor. We hope that the Communist Youth League, our glorious Soviet youth, will continue to respond with the same high enthusiasm to the calls of the Communist Party and the Soviet government to the youth and its glorious vanguard – the Communist Youth League.

Khrushchev then criticized the incorrect views of some young people towards labor in Soviet society. He said: Some young people, after graduating from ten-year schools, say: Going to factories, construction sites, collective farms, or state farms is not very suitable for educated people now. These educated people have not thought about the fact that the houses they live in were built by construction workers, their fathers work in factories, and the grain they eat is grown by our diligent Soviet laborers on state farms and collective farms.

Khrushchev said that it seems the fault lies not only with the young people who have such thoughts, but also with some people among the older generation. Some parents argue like this: My daughter cannot go to milk cows after graduating from the tenth grade!

It's okay to drink milk, but milking cows is considered undignified!

This is a vulgar attitude, a petty-bourgeois habit. Is such a vulgar attitude towards labor befitting our young men and women? This incorrect and very harmful view of labor must be resolutely condemned. It is a remnant of the old ideas left to us by capitalist society. Workers, collective farm members, and all those engaged in productive labor are the glory and pride of socialist society. Workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals create all wealth and material value through their labor.

Workers and peasants are building their new lives based on the great teachings of Marxism-Leninism. The people who create material wealth through their labor are the true creators of history. We must value and respect the working people. Everyone should be proud that they are contributing to the common cause of building a communist society through their labor. We must ridicule and eradicate this backward view. Our satirical writers should relentlessly eliminate this view, so that those who have a bad attitude towards labor will not only be ashamed of saying words that belittle labor, but also be ashamed of having such thoughts.

Khrushchev then said that during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, many enterprises will be built in the European part of the Soviet Union, but a large number of enterprises will be built in Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Far East, and other border regions and republics. The land of Siberia is a beautiful and most fertile land. Great treasures are buried under its ground. We should not abandon them, nor should we let them remain buried. We should use them to create happiness for the Soviet people and for our country. That is where our Soviet youth can show their talents: to open up uninhabited border areas and build modern factories, power stations, railways, and well-equipped cities there. The Communist Youth League has 18.5 million members. Can't the Communist Youth League send 300,000 to 500,000 people from among themselves? I think it is entirely possible. I believe in the strength of the Communist Youth League and the youth, and I believe in their combat effectiveness. We know that our youth are not afraid of the severe cold or the Siberian forests.

Khrushchev emphasized that we have all the conditions to successfully complete the new great tasks put forward by the 20th Party Congress. We have a heroic working class, glorious collective farmers, and our laboring intellectuals. The entire magnificent construction work of our Soviet people is led by the Communist Party. We have the Lenin Communist Youth League, which is the Party's assistant, and it organizes the youth to solve the tasks put forward by the Party. Therefore, comrades, we believe that the Party's recent call for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of young people to participate in the most important constructions of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be enthusiastically responded to by the Communist Youth League members and all Soviet youth. It is believable that the Communist Youth League members of Moscow, Leningrad, and other large cities in the country will set an example in this new matter. If the young people of Moscow put in a little more effort, they can draw tens of thousands of workers from among themselves to build new enterprises in the eastern region. If this matter is handled correctly, then Moscow's enterprises can draw thousands of workers to build new factories without affecting the development of production. Leningrad, Kharkov, Kiev, Sverdlovsk, and other cities like Odessa that are not planning to build new factories can draw a lot of young people to carry out the construction of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

Khrushchev then talked about the issues of further adopting reinforced concrete in construction and saving metal, improving labor productivity, and rationally and fully utilizing existing construction machinery and technology. He called on young construction workers to strive to solve these problems and overcome the existing shortcomings in these areas.

Subsequently, Khrushchev said that the Party is calling on our young people to engage in noble causes and to establish new labor merits. The greater the labor merits completed by Soviet patriots, the better the results of their selfless labor, the richer and stronger our country will be. To the enemy, it becomes more inviolable, and to our friends, it becomes more attractive.

In the future, in implementing the resolutions of the 20th Party Congress and in completing the various plans of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, we still have many things to do. Now, even our mortal enemies no longer doubt that the Soviet people will successfully complete the planned economic and cultural construction plans. Our implementation of the policy of economic competition with capitalism makes them panic and uneasy. They are afraid of this competition.

Activists in the capitalist world are now saying: We should consider revising our own policies. Here is how they are considering it: if the Soviet Union continues to move forward at this speed in the future, then it will not be long before the Soviet Union surpasses the most advanced capitalist countries economically. They see our achievements, acknowledge these achievements, and at the same time, they are afraid of these achievements.

Khrushchev emphasized that our people, under the leadership of Lenin and under the leadership of their Communist Party, overthrew the rule of capitalists and landlords, established the first Soviet country in the world, and built a socialist society. The people of other countries also want to get rid of the oppression of capitalism and want to fight for what we have already won. But, would this desire be welcomed by capitalists and landlords? No, the capitalists will do everything possible to prolong their rule over the working people.

Capitalists are very good at defending their capitalist world and their system of exploitation. They are good at organizing espionage and sending spies and saboteurs to our side. We should be good at seeing through the enemy and good at seeing through all their conspiracies in a timely manner. We should do our best to consolidate the security of our country, raise our vigilance, and crush all the enemy's activities. When criticizing the shortcomings and mistakes we have made in our progress, we should first of all think that this criticism will strengthen the Soviet system and help us move forward more quickly and successfully towards our great goal—communism.

The enemy hopes that we will relax our vigilance and weaken our state security organs. We will not do this, we will never do this! The sword of the proletariat must always be sharp and must always be good at defending the achievements of the revolution.

Khrushchev finally said that many bourgeois activists spent almost forty years before they believed in the consolidation of the Soviet country, before they recognized the greatness of Lenin, and before they recognized the greatness of Marxist-Leninist thought.

Hundreds of millions of people on Earth have already believed that socialism is superior to capitalism. We firmly believe that in the competition between socialism and capitalism, victory will surely belong to us.

But in order to succeed in this peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism, we must do a great deal of labor, correctly utilize all our possibilities and reserves, and more fully utilize the natural wealth of our country.

You young people will have many things to do in further successfully advancing our communist cause. You should move forward bravely with the enthusiasm of young people and the perseverance characteristic of young people. Communist Youth League members should drive all young people to join the socialist competition to strive to complete the various huge plans of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This is our sacred duty to the people, and our sacred duty to the growing generation. The future of communism belongs precisely to the growing generation.

    赫鲁晓夫在全苏青年建筑人员会议上演说摘要
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：赫鲁晓夫四月十一日在全苏青年建筑人员会议上发表了长篇演说。他在演说中对苏联青年的工作给予很高的评价，并且对苏联共青团员和全体青年提出了重大的任务。
    赫鲁晓夫说，共青团过去和现在一直是我们党的忠实助手和强大的后备军。共青团一贯热烈响应党所采取的一切措施，勇敢地走上责任最重的和最艰巨的斗争岗位，并且光荣地完成自己对祖国的责任。在第二十次党代表大会上，党曾经表示了对青年响应号召和他们的忘我劳动的感谢。我们希望，共青团、我们光荣的苏联青年以后继续以同样高涨的热情响应共产党和苏联政府对青年和他的光荣的先锋队——共青团的号召。
    赫鲁晓夫接着批评了一部分青年对苏维埃社会的劳动表现了不正确的看法。他说：某些青年在十年制学校毕业后说：下厂、去工地、到集体农庄或国营农场对受过教育的人来讲现在不大适合。这些受过教育的人就没有想一想：他们住的房子是建筑工人盖的，他们的父亲是在工厂工作的，他们所吃的粮食是我们苏联勤劳的劳动者在国营农场和集体农庄种植的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，看来，过错不仅在于有这种想法的青年人，而且老一代人当中也有一些人是不对的。有一些做父母的就这样议论：我的女儿在十年级毕业后可不能去挤牛奶去！
    喝牛奶可以，而挤牛奶，却认为不体面了！
    这是庸俗的态度、小市民习气。对劳动采取这种庸俗的态度，难道同我们男女青年的身份相称吗？对劳动的这种不正确的而且十分有害的观点，必须加以坚决地指责，它是资本主义社会遗留给我们的旧思想的残余。工人、集体农庄庄员、一切从事生产劳动的人，都是社会主义社会的光荣和骄傲。工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子用自己的劳动创造了一切财富和物质价值。
    工人和农民根据马克思列宁主义的伟大学说建设着自己的新生活。以自己的劳动创造物质财富的人民，是历史的真正创造者。我们必须重视和尊重劳动人民。每个人应当引以自豪的是，他用自己的劳动对建设共产主义社会的共同事业作出贡献。我们必须嘲笑和根除这种落后的看法。我们的讽刺作家应当无情地消灭这种看法，使得对劳动的态度不好的人，不仅对说出轻视劳动的话来感到羞愧，而且对有这种想法也感到羞愧。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，在第六个五年计划期间，在苏联的欧洲部分将要建筑许多企业，但是大量的企业将要建设在西伯利亚、哈萨克、远东和其他边疆区和共和国。西伯利亚土地是一块美好的、最富饶的土地。在它的地下埋藏着大量的宝藏。我们不应该抛弃它们，也不应该任其埋藏着，而要利用它们为苏联人民创造幸福，为我们国家创造幸福。那里正是我们苏维埃青年可以大显身手的地方：去开拓还没有人居住的边疆区，在那里建设起现代化的工厂、电站、铁路、设备完善的城市。共青团的队伍有一千八百五十万人。难道共青团员不能够从自己中间派出三十万到五十万人吗？我认为，这是完全可以做到的。我相信共青团和青年的力量，相信他们的战斗性。我们知道，我们的青年是不怕严寒，不怕西伯利亚的丛林的。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，我们有一切条件来胜利完成第二十次党代表大会所提出的新的伟大的任务。我们有英勇的工人阶级、光荣的集体农民和我们的劳动知识分子。我们苏联人民整个宏伟的建设工作，都是由共产党领导的。我们有列宁共产主义青年团、它是党的助手，它组织青年去解决党所提出的任务。因此，同志们，我们相信：党最近提出来的要数万、数十万青年参加第六个五年计划的最重要的建设这个号召，一定会得到共青团员和全体苏联青年的热烈响应。可以相信，莫斯科、列宁格勒和国内其他大城市的共青团员将在这件新的事情上做出榜样。莫斯科的青年人如果多尽一分力的话，就可以从自己中间抽出几万工人去到东部地区建设新的企业。如果正确地处理这件事，那么莫斯科各企业就可以在不影响发展生产的条件下抽出数以千计的工人去建设新工厂。列宁格勒、哈尔科夫、基辅、斯维德洛夫斯克，以及像敖德萨那样一些也不准备建设新工厂的其他城市，能够抽出很多很多的青年去进行第六个五年计划的建设。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了在建筑中进一步采用钢筋混凝土和节省金属、提高劳动生产率、合理和充分地利用现有的建筑机器和技术的问题，他号召青年建筑人员为解决这些问题和克服这些方面现有的缺点而努力奋斗。
    随后，赫鲁晓夫说，党号召我们青年人去从事崇高事业，去建立新的劳动功勋。苏联爱国者完成的劳动功勋越大，他们忘我劳动的成果越好，我们的国家就越富足、越强大。对敌人说来，它变得更加不可侵犯，而对我们的朋友们说来，它就更加具有吸引力。
    我们今后在实现第二十次党代表大会的各项决议方面，在完成第六个五年计划的各项计划方面，还要做很多的事情。现在，甚至我们的死敌也不再怀疑，苏联人民将成功地完成已经拟定的经济和文化建设计划。我们执行同资本主义实行经济竞赛的方针，这使他们惊慌不安。他们害怕这种竞赛。
      资本主义世界的活动家现在已经在说：应当考虑修改自己的政策了。他们在这里是这样考虑的：如果苏联在将来仍然以这种速度前进的话，那末苏联在经济方面赶过最先进的资本主义国家就为时不远了。他们看见了我们的成就，承认了这些成就，同时又害怕这些成就。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，我国人民在列宁的领导下，在自己的共产党的领导下推翻了资本家和地主的统治，建立了世界上第一个苏维埃国家，建成了社会主义社会，其他国家的人民也想摆脱资本主义的压迫，也想争取我们所已经争得的东西。但是，难道这种意愿会受到资本家和地主的欢迎吗？不会的，资本家将竭尽一切努力，千方百计地延长他们对劳动人民的统治。
    资本家很会保卫自己的资本主义世界和他们的剥削制度。他们善于组织间谍工作，往我们这边派遣间谍和破坏分子。我们应当善于识破敌人，善于及时地看透他们的一切阴谋诡计。我们应当竭力巩固我们国家的安全，提高警惕性，粉碎敌人的一切活动。在对我们在前进中所犯的缺点和错误进行批评的时候，我们首先应当想到，这种批评将加强苏维埃制度，帮助我们更加迅速、更加成功地前进，走向我们伟大的目标——共产主义。
    敌人希望我们放松警惕，削弱我们的国家保安机关。我们不会这样，我们永远也不会这样！无产阶级的宝剑必须永远锋利，必须永远善于保卫革命的成果。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，许多资产阶级活动家硬是花了差不多四十年的时间才相信了苏维埃国家的巩固，才承认了列宁的伟大，承认了马克思列宁主义思想的伟大。
    地球上已经有好几亿人相信了社会主义优越于资本主义。我们坚定地相信，在社会主义同资本主义的竞赛中，胜利一定属于我们。
    但是为了在社会主义同资本主义之间这场和平竞赛中取得成功，我们就必须进行大量的劳动，正确地利用自己全部的可能性和后备力量，更加充分地利用我们国家的自然财富。
    在把我们的共产主义事业进一步成功地向前推进方面，你们青年们将有许多事情要做。你们应当以青年人的热情、青年人特有的毅力奋勇前进。共青团员们应当带动全体青年投入到争取完成第六个五年计划的各项巨大计划的社会主义竞赛中。这是我们对人民的神圣职责，对正在成长的一代的神圣职责，共产主义的未来正是属于正在成长的一代的。
