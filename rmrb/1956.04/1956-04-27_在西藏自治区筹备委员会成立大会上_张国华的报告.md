Comrade Vice Premier Chen, Chairman, esteemed Committee Members, esteemed Delegates, esteemed Comrades:

    The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been formally established after more than half a year of consultations and preparations on all sides. This is a historically significant and joyous event in the political life of the Tibetan people. It is the result of the increasing unity among all nationalities of the motherland and within Tibet itself, as well as the increasingly close relationship between the Tibetan local authorities and the Central Government. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region marks a new stage in the work of the Tibetan region under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and under the close unity and specific leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni. On behalf of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, all comrades of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the working personnel stationed in Tibet, I extend warm congratulations on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region!

    On this day of rejoicing for all the people of Tibet, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao have sent a central delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen, composed of representatives from all fraternal nationalities, democratic parties, and people's organizations, to come from afar to offer congratulations, provide guidance, and assistance. This demonstrates the deep concern of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, as well as the people of the whole country, for the Tibetan people. It is also an honor for all the people of Tibet and the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet. We firmly believe that, with the personal instructions of the central delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen, this meeting will be even more successful, and we will achieve even more satisfactory results in completing the tasks of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

    Today, this conference has gathered together so extensively leaders and representatives from all aspects, strata, religious sects, mass organizations, and social figures in the Tibetan region, gathering together to jointly discuss managing the affairs of their own nationality, and receiving the personal guidance and assistance of the central delegation. This is a new scene of increasing unity within Tibet and a microcosm of the great unity of all nationalities in the country. We firmly believe that, under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the Tibetan people will, with the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, exert even greater strength in the cause of jointly building the great family of the motherland.

    The process experienced by Tibet in the six years since its peaceful liberation has been a process of strengthening the unity between nationalities, especially between the Tibetan and Han nationalities, and within Tibet itself. Thanks to the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the close unity and leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and the hard work of all the monastic and secular officials and people of all strata, as well as the strict implementation of the policies of national equality and unity and freedom of religious belief by the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the officers and soldiers and staff of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and the conscientious implementation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the unity within Tibet has been increasing, and the unity between nationalities has also been increasing. This is a major achievement in the work of the Tibetan region over the past six years. On the basis of this major achievement, the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, in accordance with the established policy of "unity, progress, and greater development," and in conjunction with the specific circumstances of Tibet's development in recent years, after consultation with the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, the Tibetan local government, the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee, and the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, etc., proposed the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the decision on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was approved by the seventh plenary session of the State Council on March 9, 1955. This decision is fully in line with the interests and wishes of the people of the whole country and the people of Tibet. The basic policy of the Chinese Communist Party for resolving the nationality question is to implement the policy of national regional autonomy. After the nationwide victory, it has successively helped various minority nationalities establish the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, etc. In the Tibetan-populated areas, such as Sichuan, Qinghai, and Gansu provinces, the Ganzi, Aba, Yushu, Guoluo, Haibei, Hainan, and Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures have been established respectively. They have all exercised the right of the people of their own nationality to be masters of their own affairs, and have exerted the strength of the people of all nationalities in jointly building the great family of the motherland. From their personal experience, they have come to realize the greatness and correctness of the Chinese Communist Party's, the Central People's Government's, and Chairman Mao's policy of national equality and unity, thereby gradually eliminating or are in the process of eliminating the national divisions left over from history. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is an important step in implementing national regional autonomy in Tibet, and its basic task is: "...must unite people from all aspects to further strengthen national unity and unity within Tibet, strengthen the training of national cadres, be responsible for consultation and unified planning to handle matters related to the construction of the Tibetan region and other matters that should be and can be handled, in order to gradually strengthen work responsibility, accumulate work experience, and create various conditions for the official establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region." We must, under the leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, unite with the monastic and secular people of all strata in Tibet, abide by the instructions of the State Council, and work together to complete the tasks of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

    After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Tibetan nationality returned to the great family of the motherland, and the relationship between the Tibetan nationality and the Han nationality and within Tibet has undergone fundamental changes. The Tibetan nationality is firmly united in the unified family of the motherland, and has forever gotten rid of the shackles of imperialism. In 1952, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni sent a Tibetan tribute delegation to the capital of the motherland, Beijing, to pay tribute to the Central People's Government and the great leader of all nationalities, Chairman Mao, expressing the heartfelt wishes of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibetan people to love the motherland, support the unification of the motherland, and support the central government. Through the visits and tours of the tribute delegation and the successive visiting delegations, especially the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni personally attended the first session of the First National People's Congress in 1954 on behalf of the Tibetan people, Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso and Panchen Erdeni Qoigyijabu were elected as national leading workers, the Tibetan people, through their leaders, participated in the political affairs of jointly managing the country for the first time, thereby more clearly recognizing the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, further enhancing the Tibetan people's patriotic thinking, and further strengthening the unity among the nationalities of the motherland and within Tibet, and enhancing the Tibetan people's sense of honor and responsibility in jointly building the great family of the motherland with other fraternal nationalities in the country.

    The Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao have consistently adopted a policy of freedom of religious belief and respect and protection. In 1952, when Chairman Mao met with representatives of the Tibetan tribute delegation, he said: "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, protecting believers and non-believers, believers of this religion or believers of other religions, respecting their beliefs. Today, we adopt a policy of protecting religion, and we will continue to adopt a policy of protecting religion in the future." Article 88 of our country's constitution clearly stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have freedom of religious belief." For the past six years, the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet have consistently and unwaveringly strictly abided by the policies of national equality and unity and freedom of religious belief, respecting the customs and habits of the Tibetan people, and have therefore been praised by the vast monastic and secular people of Tibet. In the future, under the leadership of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, we will continue to abide by the above-mentioned principles and policies, and continue to adhere to and implement the policy of freedom of religious belief and protection of lamaseries.

    In terms of Tibet's financial, economic, and trade work, for the past six years, we have consistently adhered to the principle of: on the one hand, transporting sufficient materials from the interior to guarantee the supply of the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet and the needs of the Tibetan people; and on the other hand, helping Tibet develop its economy and carry out construction as much as possible under the conditions. Since the liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government and the people of all nationalities in the country have vigorously supported the economic construction of the Tibetan people. As early as the early days of liberation, when it was still in the economic recovery period, in order to help Tibet develop its economic construction, a large amount of funds (direct investment of more than 200 million yuan) was invested to build the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway. Since the opening of the two highways at the end of 1954, in 1955 and 1956, highways from Lhasa to Shigatse, Shigatse to Gyantse, and Gyantse to Yatung have been built, and the great victory of the trial opening of the Heihe to Gadaqke highway, an important town in Ali, has been achieved. Now, more than 4,000 kilometers of highways have been built in the entire Tibetan region, from Qamdo in the east, Gadaqke in the west, Heihe in the north, and Yatung in the south. The main towns in the entire region have been closely linked with the interior of the motherland, which has brought more favorable conditions for helping the political, economic, and cultural development of the Tibetan region in the future. In the development of postal and telecommunications services, 40 postal and telecommunications organizations have now been established throughout the region, and they have been gradually established to the zong, which has also played a certain role in developing transportation and prospering the economy. In terms of prospering the economy and communicating the exchange of materials between inside and outside, the Tibet Branch of the People's Bank of China and the Tibet Trading Company, based on the principles of supplying foreign exchange, purchasing local and special products, and organizing the import of goods, while taking into account the needs of the people, and giving private merchants a profitable principle, have supplied more than 250 million shields of foreign exchange rupees in the past six years, transported 464,732 loads of materials from India, and organized a large number of domestic goods to supply the needs of the Tibetan people. In particular, tea, which is essential to the lives of the Tibetan people, has been transported in a total of 20.19 million catties in the past six years, an increase of nearly two times compared to the normal annual imports before liberation. Therefore, in the six years since liberation, the markets in Lhasa, Shigatse, Heihe, Gyantse, and other places have become increasingly active, and have shown some new signs of prosperity.

    In terms of agricultural, animal husbandry, and handicraft production, in addition to the Tibet Branch of the People's Bank of China issuing more than 1.386 million yuan of interest-free and low-interest agricultural, animal husbandry, and handicraft loans in the past six years, the State Council has also issued more than 1.7 million yuan of free agricultural implements, which has played a certain role in helping farmers, herdsmen, and handicraftsmen solve their living difficulties and develop production. In addition, serum factories, veterinary prevention teams, experimental farms, and mechanized farms have been established, which have also played a good role in animal disease prevention and development of agricultural production.

    In terms of disaster relief work, in addition to the timely relief provided to some earthquake areas and flood areas in 1952 and 1953, the Gyantse and Shigatse areas suffered unprecedented floods in 1954. The Central People's Government recently allocated a total of 970,000 yuan for disaster relief funds, including emergency relief funds, and used 2.4 million yuan for work-for-relief to carry out relief, and adopted the method of work-for-relief to build the highways from Shigatse to Gyantse and Gyantse to Yatung. The Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee also allocated a portion of disaster relief grain, and the vast monastic and secular people of all strata actively donated funds, and the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet also donated funds, thereby helping more than 10,000 disaster victims to overcome the disaster, rebuild their homes, and restore production.

    In terms of cultural, educational, and health undertakings, there has also been great development in the past six years. Thirty-one primary schools have been established throughout the region, and the number of children in school has reached about 2,000. The construction of middle schools has begun this year. In the past six years, the Central People's Government has spent more than 12 million yuan on health undertakings. There are now 18 hospitals and clinics throughout the region, and health clinics in the Qamdo area have been popularized to some zong. All hospitals and clinics also regularly organize mobile medical teams to go deep into rural areas and pastures to provide free medical treatment to the people, which has been warmly welcomed by the vast people.

    In terms of training Tibetan cadres, in addition to selecting more than 1,000 young people to study at the Central University for Nationalities and the Southwest University for Nationalities, the Tibetan Cadre School, the Social Education Class, and the local patriotic youth federations and patriotic women's federations have also played a major role in developing culture and training Tibetan national cadres. In the past six years, we have trained more than 1,600 Tibetan cadres, including more than 300 veterinary prevention personnel, health personnel, and tractor drivers. These cadres have played a major role in their respective jobs. In order to vigorously continue to train Tibetan national cadres, the State Council has approved the renaming of the Tibet Military Region Cadre School to the Tibet Local Cadre School. At the same time, the original monastic and secular officials and cadres in the Tibetan region have made great progress in varying degrees in all aspects in recent years, and in the future, with the development of various tasks and construction undertakings in the Tibetan region, a large number of Tibetan cadres will surely emerge.

    In general, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government in Tibet are all policies to help the Tibetan nationality unite, progress, and develop further. As Chairman Mao said when talking with representatives of the tribute delegation: "The Tibetan region is large and the Tibetan nationality has a small population. The population needs to be developed, from the current two or three million to five or six million, and then it would be good to increase it to ten million or so. In addition, the economy and culture also need to be developed. Culture includes schools, newspapers, movies, etc., and religion is also included. The reactionary ruling Qing dynasty emperors and Chiang Kai-shek all oppressed and exploited you, and the imperialists were the same, so that your population could not develop, the economy was weakened, and culture did not develop. The Communist Party implements national equality, does not oppress or exploit you, but wants to help you, to help you develop your population, develop your economy and culture. The People's Liberation Army's entry into Tibet is to implement the policy of helping you... If the Communist Party cannot help you develop your population, develop your economy and culture, then the Communist Party is of no use." For the past six years, the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have conscientiously implemented the above-mentioned principles and policies, and have achieved certain achievements, laying a good foundation for the development of Tibet's politics, economy, and culture.

    In the past few years, due to our insufficient understanding of the situation in Tibet, there have also been some shortcomings in the process of specifically implementing policies: for example, in the early days of liberation, the prices paid for some daily necessities purchased locally and for yak transportation merchants were somewhat unreasonable, causing certain losses to some people. After we discovered these shortcomings, we also took appropriate measures to deal with and correct them.

    Secondly, due to insufficient education among the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet, there are still remnants of great Han chauvinism thoughts to varying degrees among some personnel, which have affected the unity between nationalities to varying degrees. We have been and are conducting strict inspections and corrections.

    Finally, let me say a few words about the issue of reform in Tibet:

    Appropriate reforms within various minority nationalities are a necessary process for the political, economic, and cultural development and progress of various minority nationalities, and gradually joining the ranks of advanced nationalities; it is also a necessary path to enter socialist society. This is in line with the interests and requirements of the people of various minority nationalities. This has been confirmed by the development paths of the vast majority of nationalities in our country. Similarly, in order to enable the Tibetan nationality to join the ranks of advanced nationalities and transition to a bright and happy socialist society, the Tibetan people must carry out necessary reforms on the basis of strengthening unity between nationalities and within Tibet in order to be possible.

    Therefore, the issue of reform in the Tibetan region should be studied at an appropriate time, but it should not be reformed by a small number of people or by ordering it from the central government, but must be decided based on the wishes of the majority of the Tibetan people and public leaders. If the conditions are not ripe, there is no rush to start reforms. At the same time, since the social and economic aspects of the Tibetan region are very different from those of the Han nationality areas or other minority nationality areas, the methods adopted for reform in the Tibetan region in the future must also be different from those of the Han nationality areas or other minority nationality areas. According to the instructions of the central government: in the future, the reform of the Tibetan region must adopt a method of top-down, peaceful consultation, and proceed according to the wishes of the majority of the people. During and after the reform, the government will take necessary measures to ensure that the political status and material living standards of the Tibetan upper class (including the upper class in the religious community) are not reduced, and may even be better than before, that is to say, it can only be improved and cannot be worsened. This method is beneficial to the aristocratic temples, and the results of its implementation are also beneficial to the people. This is the established policy of the central government on the issue of reform in the Tibetan region.

    Some people suspect that the Communist Party's cooperation with the upper class now is a temporary utilization, and that after the reform, there will be no more cooperation. This is a complete misunderstanding. The Party and the People's Government's cooperation with the upper class of minority nationalities (including the upper class in the religious community) is long-term, and it is a consistent policy of adhering to unity and education. The Communist Party will do what it says, and will never abandon its allies after achieving its goals, because the purpose of our reform is to oppose imperialism, build a socialist motherland, and ensure the high development of the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the Tibetan people. Anyone who is willing to contribute their strength for the development and progress of their own nationality under the banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism, we will definitely cooperate with them for a long time, and this cooperation is indispensable. As early as 1950, Chairman Mao said in his closing remarks at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "As long as someone is truly willing to serve the people, has indeed helped and done good things during the period when the people are still in difficulty, and has been doing so consistently, and does not give up halfway, then the people and the people's government have no reason not to want him, and have no reason not to give him the opportunity to live and the opportunity to serve."

    Some people worry that after the reform, freedom of religious belief will no longer be protected, and may even be eliminated. This is unfounded. After the reform in the Han and Hui areas, people who believe in Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam still have freedom of religious belief. The Soviet revolution has been successful for more than 30 years, and there is still freedom to believe in various religions. This is enough to show that reform will not hinder freedom of religious belief. To say that there is no freedom of religious belief after the reform is unfounded. Is there still any doubt about this? The Chinese Communist Party has adopted a policy of protecting religion in the past, and will also adopt a policy of protecting religion in the future. After the implementation of reform in Tibet in the future, the people's religious beliefs can still be completely the same as before, believing in what they believe in.

    Chairman, esteemed Committee Members, esteemed Delegates, esteemed Officials, esteemed Comrades: With the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, it will bring new development to the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people, and it will also bring us more important tasks. We should know that the more the work in Tibet develops, the more all counter-revolutionary elements and imperialist elements will carry out provocations and sabotage in many ways. Therefore, we must unite more closely, be vigilant at all times against open and hidden enemies, and expose them in a timely manner and give them resolute and powerful blows. If counter-revolutionary elements and imperialist elements dare to launch a rebellion, we will resolutely eliminate it!

    Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, trust each other, help each other, understand each other, consult with each other, be conscientious and diligent, guard against arrogance and rashness, and strive to realize a unified Tibet Autonomous Region! Strive to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet!

    Finally, let us shout:

    Long live the Dalai Lama!

    Long live the Panchen Erdeni!

    Long live the great unity of all nationalities in the country!

    Long live the People's Republic of China

    Long live the Communist Party of China!

    Long live the great leader of all nationalities in the country, Chairman Mao! (Xinhua News Agency)

    在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上
    张国华的报告陈副总理、主席、各位委员、各位代表、各位同志：
    西藏自治区筹备委员会经过半年多来各方面协商和筹备，现在已经正式成立了。这是西藏人民在政治生活中具有历史意义的一件大喜事，它是祖国各民族之间和西藏内部的团结日益增强以及西藏地方同中央的关系日益密切的结果。西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，是标志着西藏地区的工作在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明正确的领导下，在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的亲密团结和具体领导下进入了一个新的阶段。我谨代表中国共产党西藏工作委员会和中国人民解放军西藏军区全体同志及进藏的工作人员，对西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，致以热烈的祝贺！
    在这个西藏人民万众欢腾的日子里，中共中央、中央人民政府和毛主席派遣了以陈副总理为首的、由各兄弟民族和各民主党派、各人民团体的代表组成的中央代表团远道前来祝贺，亲临指导和帮助，这是中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席以及全国人民对西藏人民的亲切关怀，也是全西藏人民和进藏的人民解放军和工作人员的荣誉。我们坚信：在陈副总理为首的中央代表团亲临指示下，这次会议一定能开得更好，对完成西藏自治区筹备委员会的任务，一定能达到更完满的结果。
    今天在这个大会上，这样广泛地聚会了西藏地区各方面、各阶层、各教派、各群众团体和社会贤达等领袖和代表人物，济济一堂，共同商讨管理本民族的事务，并得到中央代表团的亲临指导和帮助，这是西藏内部团结日益增强的新景象，也是全国各民族大团结的缩影。我们坚信：在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明正确领导下，西藏人民一定会随着西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，在共同建设伟大的祖国大家庭的事业中发挥自己更大的力量。
    西藏和平解放六年来所经历的过程，就是增强民族间的团结特别是藏汉民族的团结和西藏内部的团结的过程。由于中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明正确的领导，由于达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的亲密团结和领导，以及各位僧俗官员和各阶层僧俗人民的努力工作，由于中共西藏工委和人民解放军西藏军区的全体指战员和工作人员严格地执行了民族平等团结政策和宗教信仰自由政策，认真地执行了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，西藏内部的团结日益增强了，民族间的团结也日益增强了，这是六年来西藏地区工作中的重大成就。在这一重大成就的基础上，中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席根据既定的“团结、进步和更加发展”的方针，结合西藏近几年来发展的具体情况，经与达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼及西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会等共同协商，提出了成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的意见，并经1955年3月9日国务院全体会议第七次会议通过了关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定。这个决定是完全符合全国人民和西藏人民的利益和愿望的。中国共产党解决民族问题的基本政策是推行民族区域自治政策。全国胜利以后，先后帮助各少数民族成立了内蒙古自治区，新疆维吾尔自治区，延边朝鲜族自治州，桂西僮族自治州，海南黎族苗族自治州，西双版纳傣族自治州等，在藏族聚居的地区，如四川、青海、甘肃等省，分别成立了甘孜、阿坝、玉树、果洛、海北、海南、甘南等藏族自治州。它们都实行了本民族当家作主的权利，在共同建设祖国的大家庭中，发挥了各民族人民的力量。他们从其切身体验中认识到中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的民族平等团结政策的伟大和正确，从而逐渐地消除或正在消除历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂。西藏自治区筹备委员会是在西藏推行民族区域自治的一个重要步骤，它的基本任务是：“……必须团结各方面人士进一步加强民族团结和西藏内部的团结，加强培养民族干部，负责协商和统一筹划办理有关西藏地方建设和其他应办而又可办的事宜，以逐渐加强工作责任，积累工作经验，创造各种条件，为正式成立统一的西藏自治区而努力。”我们必须在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的领导下，和西藏各阶层僧俗人民团结一致，遵照国务院的指示，为完成西藏自治区筹备委员会的任务而共同努力。
    西藏和平解放后，西藏民族回到了祖国大家庭中来，西藏民族同汉族间和西藏内部的关系就起了根本的变化。西藏民族巩固地团结在统一的祖国大家庭里，永远摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊，1952年达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼派遣了西藏致敬团前往祖国的首都北京，向中央人民政府和伟大的各族人民的领袖毛主席致敬，表达了达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和西藏人民热爱祖国、拥护祖国统一、拥护中央的衷心意愿，并且通过致敬团及历次的参观团的参观访问，特别是1954年达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼代表西藏人民亲自出席第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措和班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞当选为国家领导工作人员，西藏人民通过其领袖第一次参与了共同管理国家的政治事务，从而更加认识到祖国的伟大和可爱，更加增长了西藏人民爱国主义的思想，更加增强了祖国各民族之间与西藏内部的团结，增强了西藏人民和国内其他兄弟民族共同建设祖国大家庭的荣誉感与责任心。
    中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的宗教政策是一贯采取宗教信仰自由和采取尊重保护政策的。1952年毛主席接见西藏致敬团的代表时说：“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的；一律加以保护，尊重其信仰，今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”我国的宪法第八十八条中明文规定着：“中华人民共和国公民有宗教信仰的自由”。六年来，进藏的人民解放军和工作人员，始终坚持不渝的严格遵守着民族平等团结政策和宗教信仰自由政策，尊重西藏人民的风俗习惯，因而得到了西藏广大僧俗人民的赞扬。今后我们在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和中共西藏工委的领导下，仍本上述方针和政策，继续遵守和实行宗教信仰自由保护喇嘛寺庙的政策。
    在西藏的财经贸易工作上，六年来，我们一直坚持着：一方面从内地运输足够的物资，保证进藏人民解放军和工作人员的供给及西藏人民的需要；一方面并在可能条件下尽量帮助西藏发展经济进行建设的方针。西藏解放后，中央人民政府以及全国各族人民一直大力地支援着西藏人民的经济建设：早在解放初期还处在经济恢复时期，为了帮助西藏发展经济建设事业，就投入大量资金（直接投资两亿余元）修筑康藏公路、青藏公路。自1954年底两条公路通车以后，1955年到1956年又修筑了拉萨到日喀则、日喀则到江孜、江孜到亚东的公路，并取得了黑河到阿里重镇噶大克试线通车的伟大胜利。现在西藏全区东由昌都、西至噶大克、北由黑河、南至亚东已修筑起四千多公里长的公路线，全区的主要城镇已经与祖国内地紧密地连在一起，这就为今后帮助西藏地区政治、经济和文化的发展带来了更加有利的条件。在发展邮电事业上，现在全区已建立了四十个邮电机构，且已逐渐建立到宗，这对发展交通、繁荣经济也起到一定作用。在繁荣经济、沟通内外物资交流上，中国人民银行西藏分行和西藏贸易公司本着供应外汇、收购土特产、组织进口货源的方针，同时兼顾到人民的需要，并给私商以有利可图的原则，六年来供给外汇卢比两亿五千多万盾，从印度购运物资达四十六万四千七百三十二驮，并组织大批国产商品供应西藏人民的需要。特别是西藏人民生活必需的茶叶，六年来共运进了二千零十九万斤，比解放前常年进量增加了将近两倍。因此，解放六年来，拉萨、日喀则、黑河、江孜等地，市场日益活跃，并呈现了某种繁荣的新气象。
    在农、牧业和手工业生产方面，六年来除中国人民银行西藏分行发放了一百三十八万六千余元的无利和低利的农、牧、手工业贷款外，并由国务院发放了一百七十多万元的无偿农具，这在帮助农、牧民和手工业者解决生活困难和发展生产上都起了一定的作用。此外，还建立了血清厂、兽防队、试验农场和机耕农场，这对兽疫防治和发展农业生产等方面也起了良好作用。
    在救灾工作方面，除1952年和1953年对某些地震地区和水灾地区进行了及时的救济外，1954年江孜、日喀则地区遭受了空前的大水灾，中央人民政府最近拨付救灾款项连同急救款共九十七万元，和以工代赈二百四十万元进行救济，并采取以工代赈的方式修筑了日喀则到江孜、江孜到亚东的公路。西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会也拨给了一部分救灾粮，各阶层广大的僧俗人民踊跃进行了捐款，进藏的人民解放军及工作人员也进行了捐款，从而帮助了一万多灾民度过了灾荒，重建了家园，恢复了生产。
    文教卫生事业方面，六年来也有了很大的发展，全区已建立了小学三十一所，就学儿童已达两千名左右，本年度已着手筹建中学。六年来，中央人民政府共支出卫生事业费达人民币一千二百万元以上，现在全区已有卫生院、所十八个，昌都地区卫生所已普及到部分的宗。所有卫生院并且经常组织巡回医疗组，深入农村、牧场为人民免费治病，得到广大人民的热烈欢迎。
    在培养藏族干部工作方面，除了选送中央民族学院及西南民族学院学习的青年共达一千多人外，藏干校和社教班及各地爱国青年联谊会和爱国妇女联谊会在发展文化和培养西藏民族干部的工作上，也起了重大的作用。六年来，我们共培养了藏族干部一千六百多名，其中有兽防人员、卫生人员、拖拉机手共三百多人。这些干部在所在的工作岗位上，发挥了重大的作用。为了大力的继续培养西藏本民族干部，国务院已经批准西藏军区干部学校改为西藏地方干部学校。同时，西藏地区原有的僧俗官员干部，几年来各方面都有很大的程度不同的进步，今后随着西藏地方各项工作和各项建设事业的发展，必将涌现出大批藏族干部来。
    总的说来，中国共产党、中央人民政府在西藏所采取的上述各项措施，都是帮助西藏民族团结、进步、更加发展的方针；正如毛主席和致敬团的代表谈话时说：“西藏地方大、西藏民族人口少，人口需要发展，从现在二、三百万发展到五、六百万，然后再增殖一千几百万就好。还有经济和文化也需要发展。文化包括学校、报纸、电影等等，宗教也在内。过去的反动统治清朝皇帝、蒋介石都压迫剥削你们，帝国主义也是一样，使得你们人口不得发展，经济削弱了，文化也没有发展。共产党实行民族平等，不要压迫、剥削你们，而是要帮助你们；帮助你们发展人口、发展经济和文化。人民解放军进入西藏就是要执行帮助你们的政策……如果共产党不能帮助你们发展人口、发展经济和文化，那共产党就没有什么用处”。六年来，中共西藏工委和人民解放军西藏军区认真地执行了上述的方针和政策，取得了一定的成就，为发展西藏的政治、经济和文化打下了良好基础。
    几年来，由于我们对西藏的情况了解不够，在具体执行政策的过程中，也曾有过一些缺点：如在解放初期时，就地采购一部分生活必需品和牦牛运输商所付的价格有些不合理，使部分群众受到一定损失，当我们发现这些缺点以后，亦采取了适当的措施加以处理和纠正。
    其次，由于在进藏人民解放军中和进藏工作人员中教育不够，在某些人员中间也还存有程度不同的大民族主义的思想残余，在不同程度上影响了民族间的团结，我们已经和正在进行严格的检查和纠正。
    最后，关于西藏的改革问题，让我顺便说几句话：
    各少数民族内部的适当的改革，是各少数民族政治、经济、文化发展进步，逐渐跻于先进民族行列所必须经历的过程；也是进入社会主义社会所必经的道路，这是符合于各少数民族人民利益和要求的，这是为我国绝大多数的民族发展道路所证实了的，同样的为了使西藏民族跻于先进民族之列，过渡到光明幸福的社会主义社会去，西藏人民必须在进行加强民族之间和西藏内部团结的基础上，进行必要的改革才有可能。
    因此西藏地区的改革问题，在适当的时机是应该研究的，但不是由少数人和中央下命令来改革，而必须依据西藏民族多数人及公众领袖的志愿来决定。如果条件不成熟，就不急于着手进行改革。同时，由于西藏地区社会经济各方面比汉族地区或其他少数民族地区有很大的不同，将来在西藏地区进行改革时所采取的办法，也必须与汉族地区或其他少数民族地区有所不同。根据中央的指示：将来西藏地区的改革，必须采取由上而下的、和平协商的办法，按照大多数人民的意愿去进行。在改革中和改革后，由政府采取必要的措施，保证藏族的上层人士（包括宗教界上层人士在内）在政治地位和物质生活水平不降低，可能比原来还要好些，也就是说只能改好，不能改坏。这种办法，对贵族寺庙是有利的，实行的结果对人民也是有利的，这是中央对西藏地区改革问题的既定政策。
    有些人怀疑共产党现在和上层人士合作是一时的利用，改革以后，就不一定合作了，这完全是误会。党和人民政府对少数民族上层人士（包括宗教界上层人士）的合作是长期的，是一贯坚持团结教育的政策的，共产党说到那里作到那里，绝不过河拆桥，因为我们进行改革的目的是为了反对帝国主义，建设社会主义的祖国，保证西藏人民的政治、经济、文化高度的发展，任何人只要愿意在反帝爱国的旗帜下为本民族人民发展进步而贡献自己的力量，我们一定会与之长期合作到底的，而这种合作是不可缺少的。远在1950年，毛主席在人民政协首届全国委员会第二次会议的闭幕词上就已经说过：“只要谁肯真正为人民效力，在人民还有困难的时期内确实帮了忙，作了好事，并且是一贯地作下去，并不半途而废，那末，人民和人民的政府是没有理由不要他的，是没有理由不给他以生活的机会和效力的机会的。”
    有人顾虑改革以后，宗教信仰自由不再受保护，甚至要消灭，这是没有根据的，汉人回人地区改革以后，信佛教的、信耶稣教的、信伊斯兰教的人民仍然有信教自由，苏联革命成功已经三十多年了，也还有信仰各种宗教自由，这足以说明改革不会妨害宗教信仰自由的，说改革之后没有宗教信仰自由，是无根据的。这难道还有怀疑吗？中国共产党对宗教过去采取保护政策，将来亦是采取保护政策，西藏将来实行改革后，人民的宗教信仰仍旧可以完全照老样子，信什么，照旧信什么。
    主席、各位委员、各位代表、各位官员、各位同志们：随着西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，将给西藏民族和西藏人民带来新的发展，同样也给我们带来了更为重大的任务。我们应该知道，在西藏工作越是向前发展的时候，一切反革命分子和帝国主义分子越会从多方面来进行挑拨和破坏，因此，我们必须更加亲密的团结，时刻警惕着公开的和暗藏的敌人，及时地予以揭发和给予坚决有力的打击，如果反革命分子和帝国主义分子敢于举行叛乱的话，我们就坚决地消灭它！
    让我们在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的领导下，互相信任，互相帮助，互相谅解，互相商量，兢兢业业，戒骄戒躁，为实现统一的西藏自治区而努力！为建设一个繁荣幸福的新西藏而努力！
    最后让我们高呼：
    达赖喇嘛万岁！
    班禅额尔德尼万岁！
    全国各民族大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    全国各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！（新华社）
