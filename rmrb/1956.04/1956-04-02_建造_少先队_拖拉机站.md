Building a "Young Pioneers" Tractor Station

The first Young Pioneers Representatives Conference in Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province, proposed to all Young Pioneers in the province to build a "Young Pioneers" tractor station with the proceeds from the "Little Five-Year Plan" activities.

In their proposal, the Young Pioneers of Wangkui County said: At present, our fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters are actively launching socialist labor competitions to create a better and happier life. We Young Pioneers are overjoyed to see our beautiful future. Recently, at the county-wide representative conference, we summarized the gains made by the children of the county last year in the "Do Something Beneficial for the Motherland" activity. The children of the county created more than 40,000 yuan of wealth in activities such as picking up grain and planting oil crops, which can buy two new tractors. In order to enable our fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters to increase grain production on the road of cooperation, support the country's industrial construction, and also for our own future life to be happier, we propose to the children of the province: actively participate in the "Little Five-Year Plan" activities initiated by the children of Beijing and other places, and not to spend the income from this activity indiscriminately, but to concentrate it into construction funds to build a "Young Pioneers" tractor station with fifteen tractors to support the country's agricultural production.

Now, the Young Pioneers in various parts of Heilongjiang Province are enthusiastically discussing and responding to this proposal.

    建造“少先队”拖拉机站
    黑龙江省望奎县第一次少先队员代表会议向全省少先队员提出以开展“小五年计划”活动的所得建造“少先队”拖拉机站。
    望奎县少先队员们在倡议书中说：目前我们的爸爸、妈妈、哥哥和姐姐们，正在为创造更美好幸福的生活而积极展开社会主义劳动竞赛，我们少先队员看到自己的美丽前景，心里都乐得开了花。最近我们在全县代表会议上总结了去年全县小朋友在“为祖国做一件有益的事”活动中的收获，全县小朋友在拣粮食和种植油料作物等活动中，创造了四万多元的财富，可以买两台新型拖拉机。为了使父、母、兄、姐们在合作化道路上，增产更多的粮食，支援国家工业建设；也是为了我们自己的未来的生活更幸福，我们向全省小朋友倡议：积极参加北京等地小朋友倡议的“小五年计划”活动，并且不把这个活动所得到的收入乱花掉，要集中起来成为建设资金，建造一个拥有十五台拖拉机的“少先队”拖拉机站，支援祖国发展农业生产的事业。
    现在，黑龙江省各地少先队员们正在热烈地讨论和响应这个倡议。
