    At the International Democratic Women's Federation Council Meeting
    Eugénie Cotton's Opening Speech
    Dear friends:
    Madame Cai Chang, President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and Vice President of the International Democratic Women's Federation, has delivered a moving speech, and I warmly thank her.
    Now, on behalf of the council members attending the meeting in Beijing, I have the honor to say to her: We are extremely pleased to be in this great China, a country with a rich and splendid past, and an even richer and more splendid future being created with incomparable enthusiasm and heroism. Chinese women, who have achieved equality with men in struggle, play a huge role in the active life of the new China; we are proud to work with them in the International Democratic Women's Federation. The Chinese women, having shattered their centuries-old chains of slavery, have given, and continue to give at every moment, a great example to women all over the world. Allow me here to pay tribute to their great women leaders, who were the heroic guides of Chinese women in the liberation struggle, and who are now their wise leaders in the work of building their great nation's future:
    Madame Cai Chang, President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China; Madame Deng Yingchao, Vice President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China; Madame Li Dequan, Vice President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Minister of Public Health of the People's Republic of China; Xu Guangping, Vice President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China; Shi Liang, Vice President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Minister of Justice of the People's Republic of China; Kang Keqing, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children, Deputy to the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.
    The great woman warrior of Korea, Madame Park Jeong-ae, was unable to attend this council meeting, and I express the regret of all council members.
    I salute all the council members attending the meeting, and all the guests who have come to Beijing after a long journey. I especially want to salute the women of great Asia and the women of Africa, who are attending the International Democratic Women's Federation meeting for the first time. I sincerely thank them for the valuable help they will give to the work of the council, and I hope that they will be inspired by the council to complete the tasks that need to be completed.
    Among the figures attending the meeting, please allow me to pay tribute to the leaders of the International Democratic Women's Federation, whose names we are all familiar with, but some of whom you will be satisfied to see for the first time.
    Here, I introduce the Vice Presidents of the International Democratic Women's Federation in Beijing:
    Madame Cai Chang
    Madame Sisa Nabarawi of Egypt
    Madame Monica Felton of England
    Madame Ransome-Kuti of Nigeria
    I also have the honor to pay tribute to the outstanding President of the Brazilian Women's Federation, Madame Blanca Fialho, who is serving as Vice President for the first time. We at the Executive Committee meeting in Moscow last November were pleased that Madame Fialho accepted the position of Vice President, and her participation in the Executive Committee will ensure that the women of Latin America have excellent representation in the future.
    I also want to pay tribute to the new Vice President, Madame Maria Maddalena Rossi, a member of the Italian Parliament. Madame Rossi has been the President of the great and active Italian Women's Union for nine years. Rita Montagnana, one of the founders of the Italian Women's Union, originally generously agreed
  to serve as one of the Vice Presidents of the International
  Democratic Women's Federation, but recently decided to resign from her
  position for health reasons, which we were forced to accept with deep regret.
  We will always be very grateful for her valuable cooperation
  with the International Democratic Women's Federation, and at the same time, we very sincerely
  welcome this successor, who was nominated by the Italian women for
  her with her full consent. The council members of the International Democratic Women's Federation are very familiar with Maria Maddalena Rossi, because she is often one of the best activists in our major international conferences.
    Now I must express regret that Madame Nina Popova was unable to attend the meeting. She has been elected as a Vice President of the International
  Democratic Women's Federation since the first International Women's Congress in 1945.
  Due to her position as Secretary of the Soviet Trade Unions, which keeps her busy, she cannot come to Beijing to attend the meeting. Now I will read her letter:
    Dear friends,
    Please accept my sincere and warm greetings.
    I am very sorry that I cannot attend the Council meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation held in such a generous and hospitable country due to work commitments.
    I sincerely hope that this meeting will be a success. I believe that this meeting will help the development of the women's movement, strengthen the unity of women, and promote cooperation between countries and international women's organizations in line with the interests of women and children and the interests of world peace.
    I join you in expressing our gratitude to the Chinese women, who have made efforts to promote the successful completion of the meeting.
    Nina Popova
    April 19, 1956, Moscow.
    Representing her here is the Secretary-General of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, who is also an outstanding and faithful activist of the International Democratic Women's Federation, Madame Liga Petrova. Millions of women around the world know this Madame Liga Petrova and are grateful for her boundless enthusiasm and hospitality in organizing countless foreign delegations to visit the Soviet Union.
    The Japanese Vice President of the International Democratic Women's Federation, Madame Raicho Hiratsuka, cannot come to Beijing. Representing her is Madame Fuki Kushida.
    We regret the absence of the Indian Vice President, Miss Pushpa Mooye Bose, due to health reasons; we are honored to welcome here the head of the Indian delegation, the Vice President of the Bombay Education and Social Committee, Carlson Sayani.
    Madame Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier, who is very dedicated to the work of the International Democratic Women's Federation, has been elected as the Vice President of the French National Assembly. Her busy duties prevent her from being here, so Madame Lysian Mazelan, President of the French Women's League of the Seine Province, will represent her here.
    I would also like to convey to the Council the apologies of our other Vice Presidents - Madame Lilli Wächter of Germany, Madame Erzsébet Andics, a member of the Hungarian government, and Dr. André Andreen, President of the Swedish Women's Federation and Chairman of the Standing Committee of Mothers Defending Children Against War, for their inability to attend.
    Finally, another great Vice President, Dolores Ibárruri, who has been a Vice President from the very beginning, is unfortunately still being held back far away from us, and we will feel lost at not having the opportunity to see her outstanding organizational and speaking skills!
    Among the leaders of the International Democratic Women's Federation, I would especially like to pay tribute to its active and enthusiastic Secretary-General, Madame Angiola Minella of Italy, and the two Deputy Secretaries-General - Madame Zoya Ivanova of the Soviet Union and Madame Simone Bertrand of France, who, together with all the staff of the Secretariat, have completed very important tasks.
    Now, I want to join all the council members, and in the name of the entire International Democratic Women's Federation, to express our condolences to Irène Joliot-Curie, who died on March 17 this year from leukemia caused by her research into radioactive materials. She was a very great scientist, and at the same time one of the most heroic defenders of the cause of justice and peace, and she was an outstanding member of the International Democratic Women's Federation. She rarely left her laboratory, but when needed, she did not hesitate to publicly express her position not only in France but also abroad. Therefore, everyone has seen her chairing the International Intellectuals' Congress for Peace in Wrocław in 1948; therefore, she went to New York in 1952 to support the Spanish Republican cause; therefore, she participated in grand gatherings in France to fight for disarmament, for a peaceful solution to the German question, and for the tenth anniversary of women's suffrage, and so on. Therefore, she sent a congratulatory message to the World Mothers' Congress held in Lausanne. She, like her mother Maria Curie-Skłodowska, proved that women can be endowed with scientific genius, and, like her mother, she supported the cause of ordinary women, because she had a great heart, which made her sensitive to all injustices and all sufferings suffered by mankind. Like her mother, she also died from researching new materials that she wanted to use to serve the welfare of mankind. But, at the time of her death, she left a huge mission to all women, regardless of rich or poor, black, white or yellow, educated or not: to work hard to ensure that justice and peace prevail in all countries of the world.
    Last year when I returned from China, I went to talk to her about my trip, and she fully agreed that the International Democratic Women's Federation should make itself more and more international in nature, thereby promoting greater unity among all women around the world. This Asian Council meeting should agree with this idea, but I have a duty to say this on this platform.
    This is not the first time that an international conference has been held in Beijing. From December 10 to 15, 1949, the Asian Women's Congress was held here, shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China. This congress highlighted the great concern of the International Democratic Women's Federation for the problems of this continent, and the concern for Asia, which is currently playing a very important role in world history. The important role of women in countries such as Vietnam, Burma, Korea, India, Indonesia, Iran and Syria had already been affirmed in 1949. However, among the one hundred and ninety-eight representatives who attended at the time, there were very few African women, and only eight women from the United Kingdom, France, the United States and the Netherlands. However, the contact between women from Asian and African countries and women from colonial countries was in itself a very important thing.
    However, the International Democratic Women's Federation Council held in Beijing today is a more meaningful gathering, because the convening of this council shows the determination of all council members - that is, women from more than sixty countries around the world - to take turns holding meetings in their respective countries in order to better understand the specific problems we each face, so that we can all help each other in the most effective way. There is no substitute for direct contact between the most representative figures of a country and the people of that country.
    In addition, the women of the country that receives us will feel the strength of our movement, realize its diversity and its effectiveness, when they see so many representatives from different countries come to their country, and therefore each of them will feel that their own strength has also grown.
    Both the women who receive and the women who are received will see that they belong to a large family, whose members are connected and united by their pursuit of the same cause - protecting their children, fighting for their rights and defending peace.
    Dear friends, this is precisely what we wanted to achieve when we established the International Democratic Women's Federation in 1945. At that time, we had just experienced the Second World War, the first time in history that many women participated in the struggle for the liberation of their countries; they were imprisoned, exiled and tortured like men; they also shouldered new responsibilities and realized their strength. The women who met in Paris in November 1945 came from the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Yugoslavia, Italy, the United Kingdom, China, India, North America and South America.
    Women, shortly after escaping the war, immediately understood the need to unite and unite with many people around the world to prevent the recurrence of a world war.
    This is how the International Democratic Women's Federation was founded, and shortly after its birth, it took on the task of defending democracy and peace, giving children a healthy, beneficial and happy life, and fighting for equal rights for women in all aspects.
    Not long ago, we celebrated its tenth anniversary around the world, and we have traced everywhere how it has completed its tasks, and how its successive congresses - the Paris Congress, the Budapest Congress, the Copenhagen Congress and the Lausanne Congress - have highlighted that women around the world are increasingly trusting it. When it was established in Paris on December 1, 1945, it only included eighty million people in forty countries, but now it has more than two hundred million members, and the Mothers' Congress has been warmly approved by women in seventy-nine countries.
    Each congress is a valuable opportunity for women from very different countries to come into contact with each other. Representatives from Nigeria and the Congo learned about representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland or China; in these last three countries, women have achieved equal rights and can reach the highest positions.
    Representatives of women from backward countries have learned that hunger, like war, can be overcome. Each of them returned to their country with the desire to do their best to change the living conditions of themselves and their children.
    The International Democratic Women's Federation not only gives women hope, but also promotes women to take action and do their best to achieve victory through the competitions it launches and the solidarity it consolidates.
    It is precisely because of this great friendship and solidarity that the International Democratic Women's Federation, after receiving a very moving letter from the patriotic Korean woman Park Jeong-ae, sent a fact-finding mission composed of twenty-three women from seventeen countries to investigate the war crimes in Korea. It is precisely because of this feeling that more and more French women are cooperating with German women to prevent new conflicts between the two countries; cooperating with Vietnamese women to supervise the implementation of the Geneva Accords; and acting together with Algerian women to prevent their sons from continuing to kill each other.
    Among all the actions taken by the International Democratic Women's Federation, the most important, of course, is the action in the spring of 1949 that united it with the International Intellectuals' Association for Peace to establish the "World Peace Movement". Through this organization, in the words of its chairman Frédéric Joliot-Curie, world opinion has formed another huge force. The voice of this force must be heard by everyone, and everyone must understand the huge role that women play in forming public opinion.
    Obviously, for ten years, the main goal of the International Democratic Women's Federation has been to defend peace, because without peace, the happiness of families cannot be guaranteed, and women's living conditions cannot be improved. But all these tasks are related, and women are now winning in all aspects.
    Everywhere, we are guiding women, making them more aware of what they can do, guiding them to fight for equality between men and women, to fight for being treated the same as men, to be treated as human beings and not as slaves. A huge competition has been launched around the world, and women have made great progress in both the political and social aspects.
    Some of the women attending this council meeting are ministers, members of parliament, trade union leaders or heads of large enterprises. Everywhere, the skills of female workers want to reach the highest standards; everywhere, peasant women want to improve their working conditions; everywhere, housewives are fighting for better housing.
    In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to overcome some prejudices that have existed for centuries; we especially admire the women of Asia and Africa, who have made great progress in all aspects in a very short period of time. Their fighting sisters in Europe and the United States will learn a lot from their recent struggles and sacrifices in Vietnam, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Cameroon or North Africa.
    Dear friends, we live in a great era in history. We are now in Asia, in this great Asia, where the Bandung Conference's principles were produced, which revealed to the human conscience some of the conditions that must be followed to enable the world to eventually achieve peace. After the terrible massacres of the two world wars, after the appalling test of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - but we know that this is insignificant compared to the disasters brought to the world by new nuclear weapons - some wise words have been spoken, bringing great hope to people. People are beginning to understand the profound meaning of the words national independence, peaceful coexistence, consultation, and disarmament. And people are not only beginning to understand these magical words, but they are also making real efforts to achieve them. Beneficial exchanges are taking place between leaders of various countries, and the cause of disarmament is enthusiastically supported by other political leaders. Economic and cultural exchanges are taking place frequently everywhere, and it is not only large industrialists or famous writers who fly from this continent to that continent, but also workers and peasants, housewives and young people who fly around. Barriers are falling one after another, and people are reaching out to each other.
    Our International Democratic Women's Federation should also take the spirit of striving for understanding and broad cooperation as its guiding principle for its activities. Here, the problem is not only geographical expansion, not only the establishment of new member groups in more countries, but the expansion of our human relations with women with various views, various positions, various races, and various religious beliefs.
    We have already begun to work in this spirit: we convened the World Mothers' Congress in Lausanne; to continue to promote this spirit, we also established the International Standing Committee of Mothers, which unites women who belong to various very different organizations, but all have the common will to oppose war to protect their children.
    We must continue to take this path to carry out all our tasks; protecting children, fighting for women's rights, defending peace, aren't these also the common wishes of women all over the world?
    Many women do not yet understand the need to unite in order to achieve these demands. Each of them wants to achieve it in their own way. But our ten years of experience tells us that only through broad unity, only through broad unity of women of different positions in all countries, can the cause we are committed to achieve victory.
    At this crucial moment, the Council meeting that begins in Beijing today will determine new guidelines for the activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation to adapt to the great trend of understanding between people that is currently prevailing around the world.
    Dear friends, our responsibility is to provide the cause of justice and peace with the increasingly powerful help of the women's movement.
    Long live the friendship of women all over the world!

    在国际民主妇联理事会会议上
    欧仁妮·戈登的开幕词亲爱的朋友们：
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席、国际民主妇联副主席蔡畅夫人发表了动人的演说，我热烈地向她致谢。
    现在我要代表在北京参加会议的理事们荣幸地对她说：我们来到这个伟大的中国感到极为愉快，中国有着丰富灿烂的过去，而中国以无比热情和英勇气概创造着的未来将更加丰富灿烂。在斗争中取得了同男人平等的地位的中国妇女在新中国的积极生活中起着巨大的作用；同她们一起在国际民主妇联中工作，我们感到自豪，中国妇女粉碎了她们几百年的奴隶锁链，这样就给予了，而且现在也无时无刻不给予全世界妇女以伟大的榜样。请允许我在这里向她们的伟大妇女领袖们致敬。在解放斗争中这些妇女领袖曾经是中国妇女英勇的引路人，而现在在建设她们伟大国家前途的工作中又是她们的英明的领导人：
    蔡畅夫人，中华全国民主妇女联合会主席、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员；邓颖超夫人，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员；李德全夫人，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席、中华人民共和国卫生部部长；许广平，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员；史良，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席、中华人民共和国司法部部长；康克清，中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会秘书长、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表。
    朝鲜的伟大女战士朴正爱夫人没有能够出席这次理事会，我代表理事会全体理事表示惋惜。
    我向所有出席理事会的理事们致敬，向所有经过长途旅行前来北京的来宾们致敬。我特别要向第一次参加国际民主妇联会议的伟大亚洲的妇女和非洲的妇女们致敬。我衷心地感谢她们将给予理事会工作的宝贵帮助，并且我希望她们将从理事会得到鼓舞，去完成需要完成的任务。
    在出席会议的人物中，请允许我向国际民主妇联的各位领导人致敬，我们大家很熟悉她们的名字，不过诸位当中有些人是初次得见其人，想必是会感到满意的。
    这里我介绍一下，在北京的国际民主妇联的副主席有：
    蔡畅夫人
    埃及的西萨·纳巴拉奥维夫人
    英国的蒙尼卡·费尔顿夫人
    尼日利亚的兰索姆·古蒂夫人
    我还要荣幸地向第一次担任副主席的巴西妇女联合会杰出的主席布朗卡·费雅利奥夫人致敬。我们在莫斯科召开的执行局会议去年十一月对费雅利奥夫人接受担任副主席的职务感到欣慰，她参加执行局的工作，今后将保证拉丁美洲的妇女有出色的代表。
    我还要向新担任副主席的意大利议会议员玛丽亚·玛达琳娜·罗西夫人致敬。罗西夫人担任伟大的和积极的意大利妇女联盟主席担任了九年，意大利妇女联盟的创始人之一丽塔·蒙塔尼亚纳原来慨然承
  允担当着国际民主妇联副主席之一的职
  务，最近由于健康的关系决定辞去了她的
  职位，我们迫不得已只好深为惋惜地同意
  了。我们对她给予国际民主妇联的宝贵合
  作将永远十分感谢，同时我们非常诚挚地
  欢迎在她充分同意之下，由意大利妇女为
  她推选出来的这位继承人。国际民主妇联理事会的理事们都很熟悉玛丽亚·玛达琳娜·罗西，因为她在我们的重大国际会议
  中经常是最优秀的活动家之一。
    现在我得对尼娜·波波娃夫人没有能够出席会议表示惋惜了。她是从1945年第
  一次国际妇女代表大会时起就被推选为国
  际民主妇联副主席的。她由于担任苏联的工会书记，重要的职务缠身，因而不能到北京来一同开会。现在我把她的信念一下：
    亲爱的朋友们，
    谨向你们致以诚挚和热烈的敬礼。
    由于工作缠身，我不能参加国际民主妇联在这样一个极其慷慨好客的国家举行的理事会会议，感到万分遗憾。
    我衷心希望这次会议获得成功。我相信，这次会议将有助于妇女运动的发展，加强妇女们的团结，促进各国和国际妇女组织之间符合于妇女和儿童利益以及世界和平利益的合作。
    我和你们一同表示对于中国妇女的感激，他们展开了努力促进会议工作获致完满的成就。
    尼娜·波波娃
    1956年4月19日，莫斯科。
    代表她在这里出席的是苏联妇女反法西斯委员会总书记。同时也是国际民主妇联出色的忠实的活动家丽佳·彼得罗娃夫人。世界上有千千万万的妇女认识这位丽佳·彼得罗娃夫人并且对她组织无数次外国代表团前往苏联参观的无限热诚和慷慨好客表示感谢。
    国际民主妇联的日本副主席平冢雷鸟夫人不能前来北京。代表她出席的是栉田蕗夫人。
    印度副主席普什帕莫耶·鲍斯小姐由于健康关系而缺席，我们感到遗憾；我们荣幸地在这里欢迎印度代表团团长、孟买教育和社会委员会副主席卡尔逊·萨雅尼。
    非常专心致力于国际民主妇联工作的玛丽—克洛德·瓦扬—古久里夫人已经当选为法国国民议会的副议长。她的繁忙的职务使她无法分身，所以塞纳省的法兰西妇女联盟主席莉西恩·马泽兰夫人将在这里代表她。
    我还要向理事会转达我们的其他几位副主席——德国的莉莉·韦希特夫人，匈牙利政府成员艾泽伯特·安迪奇夫人，和瑞典妇女联合会主席、母亲保卫儿童反对战争常设委员会主席安德烈·安德琳博士未能出席的歉意。
    最后，另一位伟大副主席，从一开始就担任副主席的多洛雷斯·伊巴露丽不幸还被阻留在距离我们遥远的地方，我们将由于没有机会看到她的卓越的组织才能和演说才能而感到惘然若失！
    在国际民主妇联的领导人中，我特别要向它的活跃而热诚的总书记，意大利的安吉奥拉·米涅拉夫人和两位副总书记——苏联的卓娅·伊凡诺娃夫人和法国的西蒙·贝特朗夫人致敬，她们同书记处全体人员完成了非常重要的任务。
    现在，我要同全体理事、并以整个国际民主妇联的名义向伊伦·约里奥—居里表示悼念，她由于研究放射性物质而患了白血症，已经于今年三月十七日去世了。她是一位非常伟大的科学家，同时她又是正义与和平事业最英勇的保卫者之一，她是国际民主妇联的杰出的会员。她很少离开她的实验室，但是，当需要的时候，她就毫不犹豫地不但在法国、而且在国外公开表明态度。因此，大家曾看见她主持1948年在弗罗茨瓦夫举行的国际知识分子争取和平大会；因此，她1952年曾到纽约去支持西班牙共和事业；因此，她在法国曾参加争取裁军、争取和平解决德国问题、妇女取得选举权十周年纪念会等等盛大集会。因此，她曾向在洛桑举行的世界母亲大会致贺词。她同她的母亲玛丽亚·居里—斯克洛多夫斯卡一样，也证明了妇女是可以赋有科学天才的，而且，她同她的母亲一样，曾支持普通妇女们的事业，因为她有一颗伟大的心，使得她对于人类遭受的一切不义和一切苦难敏于感受。她同她的母亲一样，也是由于研究她想用来为人类的福利服务的新物质而逝世了。但是，她在去世时，给一切妇女，不分贫富、黑种、白种或黄种、受过教育与否，都留下了一个巨大的使命：竭尽努力地工作，使正义和和平在世界各国取得胜利。
    去年当我从中国回国时，我曾经去同她谈谈我的旅行情况，她完全赞成国际民主妇联要使自己越来越具有世界性质、从而促使全世界一切妇女更加团结的决心。我们这次亚洲理事会会议想必会赞成这种想法，但是我有责任在这个讲台上把这一点说出来。
    在北京召开国际会议，这并不是第一次。1949年12月10日到15日已经在这里举行过亚洲国家妇女大会，大会是在中华人民共和国成立后不久召开的，这个大会突出地表现了国际民主妇联对于这个大陆的问题所感到的极大的关怀，对于目前在世界历史上起着非常重要作用的亚洲感到的关怀。1949年就已经肯定过越南、缅甸、朝鲜、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗和叙利亚等等国家的妇女们的重要作用。但是，在一百九十八名当时出席的代表中，非洲的妇女非常少，从英国、法国、美国和荷兰来的妇女也只有八人。可是亚非两洲国家的妇女同来自殖民国家的妇女相接触本身就是非常重要的事情。
    不过，今天在北京举行的国际民主妇联理事会，是一个更有意义的聚会，因为，这次理事会的召开，表明了理事会的全体理事——就是说，世界上六十多个国家的妇女——要在她们各自的国家中轮流开会的决心，以便更好地了解我们每个人所面临的特殊问题，以便让我们大家以最有效的方式来办到互相帮助。同一个国家的最有代表性的人物和这个国家的人民进行直接接触，这是什么也代替不了的。
    此外，接待我们的国家的妇女们在看见这么多不同国家的代表到她们的国家来时，她们将感觉到我们的运动的力量，意识到它的多样性和它的效力，因此她们当中的每个人都将感觉到她自己的力量也壮大了。
    接待和被接待的妇女们都会看到：她们属于一个大家庭，这个大家庭的成员都由于她们在追求同一的事业——保护她们的儿童，争取她们的权利和保卫和平，——而联系着和团结着。
    亲爱的朋友们，这一点正是我们1945年建立国际民主妇联所要实现的。当时我们刚刚经历了第二次世界大战，历史上第一次许多妇女参加了争取她们的国家解放的斗争；她们跟男人一样受到监禁，流放和酷刑；她们也曾担负起新的责任，而且也意识到她们的力量。1945年11月在巴黎开会的妇女们是从苏联、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、波兰、南斯拉夫、意大利、英国、中国、印度、北美洲和南美洲来的。
    妇女们摆脱战争后不久，马上就了解到团结起来和团结全世界许许多多的人以阻止再度爆发世界大战的必要。
    国际民主妇联就是这样成立的，它诞生后不久，马上就担负了保卫民主与和平、给予孩子们一种健康、有益和幸福的生活以及为妇女争取各方面权利平等的任务。
    不久以前我们在全世界大事庆祝了它的十周年纪念，而且我们已在各地追述了它是怎样完成它的任务的，也追述了它的历次大会——巴黎大会，布达佩斯大会，哥本哈根大会和洛桑大会——怎样突出表现了全世界妇女是越来越信任它的。当1945年12月1日在巴黎成立的时候，它只包括四十个国家中的八千万人，可是现在它有两亿多会员了，而且母亲大会得到了
  七十九个国家中的妇女们的热烈赞同。
    每次大会都是彼此极不相同的国家的妇女们互相接触的宝贵机会。尼日利亚的代表和刚果的代表，了解了苏联、波兰或中国的代表；在后面这三个国家里，妇女已取得了权利平等，她们可以达到最高的地位。
    落后国家的妇女代表们都了解到：饥饿和战争一样，是可以克服的。她们每一个人都怀着这样一个愿望回到本国去，就是要尽全力来改变她们自己和她们孩子们的生活情况。
    国际民主妇联不仅给予妇女们以希望，而且通过它所掀起的竞赛，通过它所巩固起来的团结，促使妇女们采取行动并且尽力去取得胜利。
    正是由于这种伟大的友谊和团结，国际民主妇联在接到朝鲜爱国妇女朴正爱令人极为激动的书信以后，就派遣了一个由十七个国家的二十三个妇女组成调查团，去调查在朝鲜的战争罪行。正是由于这种情感，越来越多的法国妇女同德国妇女合作，使两国之间不再发生新的冲突；同越南妇女合作，来监督日内瓦协定的执行；与阿尔及利亚妇女共同行动，使她们的儿子不再继续互相残杀。
    在国际民主妇联所采取的一切行动里面，最重要的当然是1949年春天使它和国际知识分子争取和平协会联合起来建立“世界和平运动”的这个行动。通过这个组织，用它的主席弗雷德里克·约里奥—居里的话来说，世界舆论形成了另一支巨大的力量。这一支力量的声音必须使大家都听得到，并且必须使每一个人都了解妇女们对形成舆论所起的巨大作用。
    显然，十年以来，国际民主妇联的主要目标就是保卫和平，因为没有和平，家庭的幸福就得不到保证，妇女的生活条件也得不到改善。但是所有这些任务都是有联带关系的，妇女现在在各方面都获得了胜利。
    在各个地方，我们引导着妇女们，使他们更清楚地了解她们可以作到的事情，引导着她们为争取男女平等而斗争，为争取受到和男子一样的待遇，当作人而不当作奴隶来看待而斗争。在全世界已经展开了巨大的竞赛，而且，在政治方面以及在社会方面，妇女们都取得了巨大的进步。
    出席这次理事会的妇女中，有一些人是部长、国会议员、工会负责人或者大企业的负责人。在各个地方，女工们的技能都想达到最高标准；在各个地方，农妇们都要改善她们的工作条件；在各个地方，家庭主妇们都为较好的住房而斗争。
    为了达到这个目标，就必须克服若干世纪以来的一些成见；我们特别钦佩亚洲和非洲的妇女们，她们在非常短的时间内，在各方面都获得了巨大的进步。她们欧美的战斗姊妹们将从她们最近在越南、在印度尼西亚、在南非、在尼日利亚、在喀麦隆或者在北非所进行的斗争和牺牲中学到很多的东西。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们生活在历史上伟大的时代。我们现在是在亚洲，在这个伟大的亚洲，产生了万隆会议的原则，这些原则向人类良心揭示了使全世界最终都能够实现和平的一些应当被遵从的条件。在两次世界大战的可怕的大屠杀之后，在广岛和长崎遭受原子弹轰炸的骇人的考验之后——但是我们晓得比起新核子武器为世界所带来的灾难来，这还是微乎其微的——，传出了一些明智的言论，带给人们以巨大的希望。人们开始懂得了民族独立、和平共处、协商、裁减军备这些字眼的深刻含意。而且人们不仅开始懂得了这些有魔力的字眼，而且人们正在切实努力争取予以实现。各国领袖们之间进行着有益的交往，裁减军备的事业受到其他政界领袖们热烈的支持。人们到处都在频繁地进行着经济和文化交流，而且不仅仅是大工业家或著名的作家们从这个洲飞到那个洲，工人们和庄稼汉、家庭主妇、青年们也要飞来飞去。壁垒纷纷倒下，人们彼此伸手相向。
    我们的国际民主妇联，也应该以争取谅解与广泛合作的精神作为它的活动方针。这里，问题不仅仅在于地理上的扩大，不仅仅在于在更多的国家里建立新的会员团体，而是在于扩大我们同具有各种见解、各种地位、各种种族、各种宗教信仰的妇女们之间的人的关系。
    我们已经开始根据这种精神工作：我们在洛桑召开了世界母亲大会；为了继续发扬这种精神，还设立了国际母亲常设委员会，它所团结的妇女虽然分别属于各种极不相同的组织，却都具有反对战争以保卫她们的孩子们的共同意志。
    我们必须继续采取这条道路来执行我们所有的任务；保护儿童、争取妇女权利、保卫和平，难道这些不也是全世界妇女们的共同愿望吗？
    许多妇女还不了解为了实现这些要求而团结起来的必要。她们每个人都想用自己的办法来达到它。但是我们十年来的经验告诉我们：只有广泛团结起来、只有在所有的国家把种种地位不同的妇女广泛团结起来，我们所致力的事业才能够获得胜利。
    在这个具有决定意义的时刻，今天在北京开始举行的理事会会议将要确定国际民主妇联活动的新方针，以适应目前在全世界盛行的人与人谅解的伟大潮流。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们的责任是为正义与和平事业提供妇女运动的日益有力的帮助。
    全世界妇女的友谊万岁！
