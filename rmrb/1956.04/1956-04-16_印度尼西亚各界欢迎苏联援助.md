Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 15th: The Soviet Union's economic aid to Indonesia has aroused widespread interest here.

    According to the "Kompas" newspaper on April 12th, Foreign Minister Abdulgani said that the Indonesian government has agreed in principle to accept economic and technical assistance from the Soviet Union. He told a "Kompas" reporter that the Soviet Ambassador to Indonesia had conveyed the Soviet government's willingness to provide assistance to Indonesia.

    Antara News Agency reported on April 13th that the Chairman of the Muslim Teachers Association, Dahlan, said: "In accordance with our current independent policy, we are always willing to accept any assistance from any country, including the Soviet Union."

    Dahlan said that as long as such assistance does not come with any political or military conditions, "we will certainly accept it, because we do not have capital and large industries." He also said: "We should truly implement an independent policy on the issue of economic assistance."

    "Sin Po" reported on April 13th that when answering questions from reporters, the Chairman of the Indonesian National Party's parliamentary group, Hadi, said that he agreed to accept Soviet assistance. Hadi also believed that Indonesia could accept assistance from any country, as long as the assistance was not subject to political or military conditions. The National Party leader said: "Accepting such assistance does not violate our independent policy in the slightest."

    "Republik" newspaper on April 14th compared Soviet aid with American aid, noting that the Soviet Union provides long-term loans to India and Afghanistan at low interest rates, while Indonesia's experience in accepting American aid has been far from pleasant. American aid is provided at high interest rates and is subject to conditions, that is to say, this aid can only be used for construction projects agreed upon by the Export-Import Bank of the United States.

    "Republik" emphasized that when considering accepting foreign aid, "we must pay attention to our independent foreign policy dedicated to abolishing colonialism from the world." The newspaper concluded: "Indonesia can only hope to receive genuine assistance from those countries that truly want to abolish the oppression of man by man and abolish colonialism."

    印度尼西亚各界欢迎苏联援助
    新华社雅加达15日电　苏联给予印度尼西亚经济援助的问题已经在这里引起了广泛的兴趣。
    据四月十二日“指南针报”说，外交部长阿卜杜加尼说，印度尼西亚政府原则上同意接受苏联的经济和技术援助。他向
  “指南针报”记者说，苏联驻印度尼西亚大使已经转达了苏联政府愿意给印度尼西亚援助的愿望。
    安塔拉通讯社四月十三日说，回教师联合会主席达兰说：“遵照我们目前的独立政策，我们永远愿意接受来自任何国家的任何援助，包括苏联在内。”
    达兰说，只要这种援助不附带任何政治和军事条件，“我们当然会接受，因为我们没有资本和大工业”。他还说：“我们应当在经济援助问题上真正执行独立的政策。”
    “新报”四月十三日报道，印度尼西亚国民党国会党团主席哈迪在回答记者的问题时说，他同意接受苏联的援助。哈迪还认为，印度尼西亚可以接受任何国家的援助，只要援助不附加政治或军事条件。这位国民党领袖说：“接受这种援助丝毫不违反我们的独立政策。”
    “共和国报”四月十四日把苏联的援助和美国的援助作了一个比较，这家报纸指出，苏联以低利长期贷款给印度和阿富汗，而印度尼西亚接受美国援助的经验是远非令人愉快的。美国的援助是以高利提供的并且附有条件，也就是说，这种援助只能用在美国进出口银行所同意的那些建设工程上。
    “共和国报”强调指出，在考虑接受外国援助的时候，“我们必须注意我们的致力于从世界上废除殖民主义的斗争的独立外交政策”。这家报纸最后说：“印度尼西亚只能希望从那些真正想废除人对人的压迫和废除殖民主义的国家得到真正的援助。”
