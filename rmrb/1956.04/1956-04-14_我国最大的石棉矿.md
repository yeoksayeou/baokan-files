    China's Largest Asbestos Mine
    Zhao Shifu
    In the southwest corner of Sichuan Province, in the Hengduan Mountains on the south bank of the Dadu River, lies a rich deposit of asbestos. China's largest asbestos mine is located here.
    Asbestos has a wide range of uses. It can be made into insulation materials, brake materials for motor vehicles, and packing materials. Without asbestos sheets, penicillin injections could not be filtered...
    To develop these precious resources of our motherland, hundreds and thousands of people have settled here in recent years.
    On the steep mining site, crisscrossing narrow-gauge railways extend in all directions from the open-pit mining area. On the terraced mining points along the railway, under the bright blue sky, miners are busily excavating asbestos, clearing barren soil and rocks. At the same time, in the deep tunnels, tunnel miners, relying on the strong light of carbide lamps, are also working hard to mine asbestos and transport barren soil and rocks by mine car.
    In recent years, the asbestos mine has been progressing at a rapid pace. The asbestos production in 1951 exceeded the total production in the ten years before liberation. The production in 1954 increased eighty-two and a half times compared to 1950. The total production value in 1955 increased by 66% compared to 1954. In the past three years, they have turned over to the state profits equivalent to more than 80,000 taels of gold. They have built tens of thousands of square meters of buildings on barren mountains and slopes, making the banks of the Dadu River even more magnificent.
    The miners love the new life they have created, but they are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. They are vigorously promoting advanced Soviet mining experience and striving to complete the tasks during the first Five-Year Plan thirteen and a half months ahead of schedule.

    我国最大的石棉矿
    赵世富
    在四川省西南角，大渡河南岸的横断山脉中，蕴藏着丰富的石棉。我国最大的石棉矿就在这里。
    石棉的用处很广，可以制成隔热器材，可作机动车的掣动器材和填塞器材；没有石棉制的石棉板，盘尼西林注射液就无法过滤……
    就是为了开发祖国这些珍贵的宝藏，几年来，成百上千的人到这里来安了家。
    在那陡峭的矿山工地上，纵横的轻便铁道，从露天采矿区四通八达地延伸开去。在铁道两旁的梯形开采点上，在那明媚的蓝天下，矿工们正在忙碌地采挖石棉，清除荒土和岩石。同时，在深邃的坑道内，坑道矿工靠着电石灯强劲的光亮，也在紧张地开采石棉和用矿车输出荒土、荒石。
    这几年来，石棉矿以飞快的速度前进着。1951年的石棉产量，超过了解放前十年的总产量；1954年的产量，比1950年增加了八十二倍半；1955年的生产总值，又比1954年提高66％。近三年来，他们上缴给国家的利润合黄金八万多两。在荒山、荒坡上，他们已经建筑起数万平方公尺楼房，使大渡河两岸更加雄伟壮观。
    矿工们热爱自己创造的新生活，但是并不满足于已经取得的成绩。他们正在大力推广苏联先进采矿经验，争取提前十三个半月完成第一个五年计划期间的任务。
