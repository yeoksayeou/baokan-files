    To improve commodity management, the commercial system in Jilin Province has launched an advanced worker movement, striving to comprehensively overfulfill the commercial plan. Currently, more than 20,000 commercial workers across the province have participated in this movement. According to statistics from thirteen cities and counties, there are already more than 1,100 commercial advanced workers.

    Commercial workers in Jilin City have proposed more than 3,400 rationalization proposals regarding improving management, etc., during the movement. The hardware group of the wholesale department of the Jiaohe County Department Store and the machinist group of the Siping City Hardware Company have gone deep into the rural areas, actively supplying goods and completing their sales plans ahead of schedule.

    吉林省商业系统展开先进工作者运动，争取全面超额完成商业计划。现在全省已经有两万多名商业工作人员参加了这个运动。根据十三个市县的统计，商业先进工作者已经有一千一百多名。
    吉林市商业工作人员在运动中提出了三千四百多件关于改善经营管理等方面的合理化建议。蛟河县百货公司批发部五金小组和四平市五金公司机工组，深入农村，主动供应商品，提前完成了销售计划。
