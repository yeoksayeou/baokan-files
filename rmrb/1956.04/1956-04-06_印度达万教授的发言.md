I am very happy and honored to be able to attend the 10th Anniversary Commemoration of the World Federation of Scientific Workers today. On behalf of the Indian Association of Scientific Workers, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to everyone. The Indian Association of Scientific Workers is one of the founding member organizations of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, and we are proud to share this honor with other founding member organizations. The World Federation of Scientific Workers has accomplished a task of extremely great significance. It has united scientific workers from all countries around the world to discuss scientific issues. In particular, it has focused people's attention on the relationship between science and society. In our era, science has become the single greatest tool for transforming the world into a prosperous, wealthy, happy, and beautiful place for all mankind. Unfortunately, however, this great and noble possibility has not become a reality. Scientific workers around the world, as well as people around the world, must actively and continuously provide support, and only then will this possibility become a reality. Science and its application can make special contributions to backward Asian countries like India. India has a long and ancient cultural tradition, but for hundreds of years, the Indian people have lived in poverty. India has a wide variety of abundant natural resources, as well as enormous manpower. After experiencing many difficulties, our people are now able to build our economy and permanently eradicate famine and poverty. As you may know, India is now embarking on a Five-Year Plan to lay the foundation for the future prosperity of our hundreds of millions of people. The two main goals of this plan are: (1) to rapidly industrialize, with particular emphasis on the development of heavy industry; (2) to greatly increase the number of jobs and income for the masses of people, and to improve social welfare undertakings such as health care, insurance, and so on. In this regard, I would like to present some figures: steel production will more than triple (from 1.3 million tons to 4.3 million tons); electricity generation will more than double (from 10 billion kilowatt-hours to 22 billion kilowatt-hours); and the number of new jobs will increase to 10 million. In this great work, everything clearly depends on the proper and rapid use of social service institutions. It is not only necessary but absolutely essential for our scientific workers to understand and face up to this great social responsibility that has been placed upon them. I can point out here that the social responsibility of Indian scientific workers today is broader in content than the purely narrow economic sense of national construction work. We want to revitalize our great legacy of the past and endow it with modern new content and meaning. In this regard, the application of scientific methods is necessary. We must remedy our previous work, remedy the narrow shortcomings of the foundation of our scientific work, in order to combine our work with the genius of the people. We must create a new scientific tradition in our own country, which not only utilizes advanced science and technology but also broadly treats social problems from a humanitarian point of view, and obtains the active and enthusiastic support of our people by solving their problems. We face a similar enormous task as other backward countries, and in carrying out this task in our country, we can learn many things from others through the exchange of ideas, the exchange of technology, and the visits of scientific workers. We hope that the World Federation of Scientific Workers and other scientific organizations will actively cooperate with us, and we believe that this cooperation will soon be realized.

To achieve all this, a necessary prerequisite is that the world must have peace, and that we must do our utmost to maintain and consolidate peace. Every Indian, especially scientific workers, recognizes the importance of the famous Five Principles jointly issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India. We must all unite and strive for the prohibition of nuclear weapons and for disarmament. In this regard, I believe that if the World Federation of Scientific Workers can act as the guardian of the conscience of the world's scientific workers, it will surely make a special contribution. I would like to wish, on behalf of myself and the Indian Association of Scientific Workers, that the World Federation of Scientific Workers will continue to achieve success in all its work in the coming years!

    印度达万教授的发言
    我今天能出席世界科学工作者协会成立十周年纪念会，自己感到很高兴、很荣幸。我谨代表印度科学工作者协会向各位致以衷心的祝贺。印度科学工作者协会是世界科协创始会员团体之一，我们因能与其他创始会员团体共享这种荣誉而感到骄傲。世界科协已完成了一项意义极其重大的任务，它团结了全世界各国的科学工作者来讨论科学的问题，它尤其是使得人民的注意力集中到了科学和社会的关系。在我们这个时代里，科学已经成为使世界变成全人类的繁荣富裕、美好幸福的地方的唯一最伟大的工具。然而不幸的是，这一伟大而崇高的可能性未能变成现实。全世界的科学工作者以及全世界人民必须积极而继续不断地给予支持，然后这种可能性才会成为现实。对像印度的这样的一些亚洲落后国家来说，科学以及其运用是可以做出特殊的贡献的。印度有着悠久而古老的文化传统，但是，几百年来，印度人民一直过着贫困的生活。印度有着各种各样丰富的天然资源，同时也有着巨大的人力。在经历了许多困难之后，我国人民现在已经可能建设我国的经济并永远根除饥荒和贫困。你们也许知道，印度为了打下我国亿万人民将来繁荣昌盛的基础，现在正在着手进行五年计划。这个计划的两个主要目标是：（1）迅速进行工业化，特别着重发展重工业；（2）大大增加人民群众的就业人数和收入，增进社会福利事业，如卫生事业、保险事业等等。在这方面，我想提出一些数字：钢的产量将增加到三倍以上（从130万吨增到430万吨）；发电量将增加一倍以上（从100亿瓩时到220亿瓩时）；新就业的人数将增到一千万。在这个伟大的工作当中，一切显然都有赖于恰当而迅速地利用社会事业机构。对我国的科学工作者来说，了解并正视已经摆在他们身上的这种伟大的社会责任，这不仅是必需的而且是绝对必需的。我可以在这里指出，今日印度科学工作者的社会责任，其内容比纯粹狭隘的经济意义的国民建设工作要广泛些。我们要使我国过去伟大的遗产重新获得生命力，并赋予以现代的新内容和意义。在这一点上，科学方法的运用就是必要的。我们必须补救我们以前的工作，补救我们科学工作基础窄小的缺憾，以便把我们的工作和人民的天才结合起来。我们必须在自己的国家里创造一个新的科学传统，它不仅利用进步的科学技术，而且还要从人道观点来广泛地对待社会问题，通过解决我国人民的问题来取得他们积极而热情的支持。我们同其他落后国家同样面临着这样一巨大的任务，在我国进行这一任务时，我们可以通过思想交流、技术交流和科学工作者的来往，向别人学习很多东西。我们希望世界科学工作者协会和其他的科学家组织积极与我们合作，我们相信这种合作很快就会实现。
    要实现这一切，必要的前提就是世界必须有和平，就是我们必须尽最大力量来维护和巩固和平。每一个印度人，尤其是科学工作者，都认识到中印两国总理所发表的著名的五项原则的重要意义，我们大家必须团结起来，为禁止核子武器和争取裁减军备而努力。在这方面，我相信世界科学工作者协会如果能够像世界科学工作者的良心的护卫者一样而行动起来，它一定会作出特殊的贡献。我愿意代表我自己及印度科协祝世界科学工作者协会在今后几年的全部工作中继续不断地获得成就！
