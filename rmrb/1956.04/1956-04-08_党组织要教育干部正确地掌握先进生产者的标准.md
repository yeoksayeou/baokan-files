Party Organizations Should Educate Cadres to Correctly Grasp the Standards of Advanced Producers
Xu Yao

In factories and mines, the selection of advanced producers aims to motivate intermediate and backward workers to emulate advanced figures, mobilizing all workers to work together to complete and overfulfill state plans. To ensure that the selection of advanced producers truly achieves this effect, it is crucial to correctly grasp the standards of advanced producers and to encourage workers to carry out bottom-up comparisons. In the recent selection of advanced producers at the Harbin Flax Factory in Heilongjiang Province, the Party committee firmly grasped these two principles, leading to a factory-wide advanced producer movement.

At the beginning of the selection process, the Harbin Flax Factory Party Committee noticed that some leading cadres lacked a correct understanding of the standards of advanced producers. Some had a perfectionist mindset, believing that advanced producers should not only be skilled in production but also be the most outstanding in politics and other aspects; if there were slight shortcomings in ideology or work style, they should not be selected as advanced producers. For example, Xu Ruquan, a stoker in the Electric Power Department, proposed burning low-quality coal, saving the state 868 tons of coal, worth approximately 11,000 yuan, making him eligible to be selected as an advanced producer. However, some people argued: "This rationalization proposal is good, but this person likes to make sarcastic remarks and cannot be rated as an advanced producer." Some leading cadres not only lacked the necessary care and consideration for female workers with many children but also regarded their inability to attend meetings due to family matters as a sign of backwardness, even if they had outstanding work performance, they could not be selected as advanced producers. Lu Xiujuan and Gao Jing, from the weaving workshop's preparation section, were consecutive winners for twenty-seven months. Gao Jing was named a municipal model worker, while Lu Xiujuan was not even a factory-level model worker. The only reason was that Lu Xiujuan was a mother of four children. Although she had not been absent from work for four years, sometimes she could not attend meetings due to family matters, or she did not speak at meetings. The leading cadres considered her "backward." What was particularly intolerable was that some individual leading cadres dismissed the labor enthusiasm of a few workers as being solely for the sake of earning more wages. Therefore, not only did they not rate these people as advanced producers, but they also labeled them with serious accusations. For example, Zhang Yuxi, a yarn hanger in the processing workshop, created a set of advanced operating methods. After the implementation of this advanced operating method, the yarn hanging output could be increased by 30%. Zhang Yuxi unreservedly taught his experience to others and helped four workers master this advanced operating method. Zhang Yuxi himself is already working on the tasks of November 1957. However, the leading cadres of his branch and workshop labeled him with the "economic viewpoint" and did not rate him as an advanced producer, nor did they seriously summarize and promote his advanced operating experience. Under the domination of these one-sided and erroneous ideas, the list of twenty advanced producers proposed by the spinning workshop was reviewed by the Party, government, labor union, and youth league cadres at the branch level, and fifteen were crossed out. The director of the Electric Power Department shouted, "Rushing forward!" when he heard that the Electric Power Department had selected twenty-seven advanced producers.

Obviously, if these one-sided and erroneous ideas are not overcome, they will seriously hinder the development of the advanced producer movement. Therefore, the Harbin Flax Factory Party Committee convened several meetings of Party branch secretaries and section chiefs and above, organized everyone to study the documents on developing the advanced producer movement, and examined and criticized the one-sided views in the selection of advanced producers. Through this study and examination, the cadres clearly realized that anyone who had one outstanding achievement in implementing the four principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, while other aspects also reached a general level, or who had inventions, creations, or put forward significant rationalization proposals, could be rated as an advanced producer. As for some shortcomings in ideology and work style, they should be patiently helped to overcome them, and their achievements in production and work should never be negated, nor should serious accusations be made against them casually.

After unifying the ideological understanding of the cadres and correctly grasping the standards of advanced producers, the Party Committee and the Labor Union immediately led all the factory workers to launch the work of selecting advanced producers. Cadres of functional departments went deep into the field to find historical data and calculate the advanced figures who completed the Five-Year Plan, the 1956 Plan, and the first quarter of the 1956 Plan ahead of schedule. Leading cadres at all levels personally participated in summarizing the deeds of advanced producers. In the summary and selection process, the Party Committee paid attention to conducting multi-faceted investigations and research, and widely listened to the opinions of various organizations and workers. After the deeds of the advanced producers were summarized, the Party Committee handed them over to the workers for discussion and review, calling on everyone to boldly put forward supplementary and modified opinions; at the same time, it also vigorously publicized the deeds of the advanced producers through forms such as blackboards, wall newspapers, radio stations, honor rolls, and congratulatory teams, calling on the workers to actively learn from advanced experiences. During this period, the Party Committee also took a series of measures to specifically lead and help workers learn advanced ideas and advanced production technologies. For example, the workers with the worst skills and newcomers were organized, and advanced producers personally taught them operating methods during their spare time. Operating competitions were implemented, and every bit of experience was collected and made complete, and then organized for promotion; or operating technology performances were held in the same type of work, and everyone observed, learned from each other's strengths, and improved together. Topics were proposed based on product quality, output, and operational problems in the workshop, and advanced producers were asked to conduct experiments, and then everyone was organized to discuss, and after field observation and measurement, the correct conclusions were drawn, and then organized for promotion, and so on.

Through the above series of work, the Harbin Flax Factory not only successfully completed the work of selecting advanced producers but also greatly stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. Some workers have mastered advanced operating methods, and new atmospheres have emerged in production. For example, after the maintenance team of the yarn workshop's protection department promoted the "Five-Three Maintenance Method," the flatcar time was greatly shortened, and the equipment operation rate was improved. In the past, each wet spinning small flatcar needed to stop for twelve shifts, but now, on the basis of ensuring quality, it only takes four shifts, which can increase the production of wet spinning yarn by 28,584 kilograms. After the dry spinning workshop helped Li Shuying absorb the experience of Wu Xianglan and others, Li Shuying's operating method was made more perfect, and after it was promoted throughout the workshop, the waste hemp rate in the three work areas of this workshop was greatly reduced.

Finally, in order to better consolidate the production enthusiasm of the workers and promote the advanced producer movement, the Party Committee mobilized the workers to formulate group and individual plans based on the factory's production plan, guiding the workers to further tap their potential and strive to improve their ideological awareness and cultural and technical levels. According to statistics, the enthusiasm of the workers has been even higher in all departments that have already formulated group and individual plans. Many workers have not only stipulated the personal production targets to be achieved this year in their plans but also put forward specific measures to achieve the targets, and formulated plans for studying culture and striving to join the Party and the League. Many workers' groups have also established inspection systems to check the completion of tasks every day and carry out criticism and self-criticism.

    党组织要教育干部正确地掌握先进生产者的标准
    徐耀
    在厂矿企业中评选先进生产者，是为了推动中间和落后的职工向先进人物看齐，动员全体职工共同为完成和超额完成国家计划而努力。而要使评选先进生产者的工作真正收到这样的效果，首先必须正确地掌握先进生产者的标准，同时还要发动职工群众开展自下而上的评比。在最近黑龙江省哈尔滨亚麻厂评选先进生产者中，由于党委紧紧地掌握了这两个原则，因而该厂已经通过这次评选，在全厂掀起了一个先进生产者运动。
    在评选先进生产者的工作刚开始的时候，哈尔滨亚麻厂党委就注意到，有些领导干部对先进生产者的标准缺乏正确的理解。有的人有一种求全的思想，认为先进生产者不仅要是生产上的能手，而且要在政治上以及其他方面都是最优秀的；如果思想作风上稍微有些缺点，就不能被评选为先进生产者。例如，电动部司炉工人徐汝泉倡议烧劣质煤，为国家节约了868吨煤，约合人民币一万一千元，有条件被选为先进生产者。但是有人认为：“这个合理化建议是好的，不过这个人好说怪话，不能评为先进生产者。”还有一些领导干部，不仅对子女众多的女工缺乏应有的关怀和照顾，而且把她们因为家事牵累而不能参加会议当做是落后的表现，即使她们有优异的工作成绩，也不能评选为先进生产者。织布场准备车间的陆秀娟和高晶，都是连续二十七个月的优胜者，高晶被评为市劳动模范，而陆秀娟则连厂级的劳动模范也不是，唯一的原因是陆秀娟是四个孩子的母亲，虽然她四年没有缺过勤，但有时因家事不能参加会议，或参加会议而不发言，领导干部就认为她“落后”。尤其不能容忍的是，个别领导干部把少数工人的劳动热情说成是为了多挣工资，因此，不但不把这些人评选为先进生产者，而且还给他们扣上一些大帽子。如加工场挂纱工人张玉喜，创造了一套先进的操作方法。这套先进操作方法实行以后，挂纱产量可以提高30％。张玉喜毫不保留地把自己的这个经验教给别人，并且帮助四个工人掌握了这种先进的操作方法。现在张玉喜本人已经在做1957年11月份的工作。但是，他所在分场和车间的领导干部，却给他扣上个“经济观点”的帽子，不评选他为先进生产者，也不认真地总结和推广他的先进操作经验。正是在这些片面的和错误的思想支配之下，前纺车间提出的二十个先进生产者的名单，拿到分场党、政、工、团干部会议上一审查，就勾掉了十五名；电动部主任一听说电动部评选出二十七名先进生产者，就大喊：“冒进了！”
    很显然，这些片面的和错误的思想不克服，就会严重地妨碍先进生产者运动的开展。因此，哈尔滨亚麻厂党委连续召开了数次党支部书记和科长以上干部会议，组织大家学习了有关开展先进生产者运动的文件，检查批判了在评选先进生产者中的片面的观点。通过这样的学习和检查，使干部明确地认识到：凡是在贯彻执行多、快、好、省四条中有一条突出而其他各条也达到了一般水平，或者有发明创造和提出重大合理化建议者，都可以评为先进生产者；至于思想作风上的一些缺点，则应该耐心地帮助他们克服，决不应因此就抹杀他们在生产和工作上的功绩，更不能随便给他们扣大帽子。
    在统一了干部的思想认识，正确地掌握了先进生产者的标准以后，党委和工会随即就领导全厂职工展开了评选先进生产者的工作。职能部门的干部深入到现场寻找历史资料，计算提前完成五年计划、1956年计划和1956年第一季度计划的先进人物。各级领导干部都亲自参加总结了先进生产者的事迹。在总结和评选中，党委注意了多方面地进行调查研究，广泛地听取了各个组织和职工群众的意见。而在先进生产者的事迹总结出来以后，党委就把它们交给职工群众讨论审查，号召大家大胆地提出补充和修改的意见；同时还通过黑板报、墙报、广播台、光荣榜、贺喜队等形式，大张旗鼓地宣传了先进生产者的事迹，号召职工群众积极学习先进经验。在这期间，党委还采取了一系列措施，具体地领导和帮助职工们学习先进思想，学习先进的生产技术。例如，把技术最差和新来的工人组织起来，利用业余时间，由先进生产者亲自教给他们操作方法。实行操作比赛，把每个人点滴的经验集中起来，使其完整，然后组织推广；或者在同一工种中举行操作技术表演，大家观摩，从中取长补短，共同提高。根据车间产品质量、产量及操作上的问题提出课题，交先进生产者进行试验，然后组织大家讨论，并经实地观摩测定得出正确结论后，再组织推广，等等。
    经过上述一系列的工作，哈尔滨亚麻厂不但顺利地完成了评选先进生产者的工作，而且大大地激发了职工群众的积极性和创造性，部分职工已经掌握了先进的操作方法，生产上已经出现了一些新气象。如纱场保全部保全队推广“五三保全工作法”以后，大大地缩短了平车时间，提高了设备运转率。过去每台湿纺小平车需停台十二个班，而目前在保证质量的基础上只用四个台班，可以增产湿纺纱28，584公斤。干纺车间在帮助李淑英吸取了武香兰等人的经验，使李淑英的操作法更加完善，并在全车间推广以后，这个车间的三工区大大地降低了废麻率。
    最后，党委为了更好地巩固职工群众的生产热情，推进先进生产者运动，又发动职工群众根据厂的生产规划，制定小组和个人的规划，引导职工群众进一步挖掘潜力，努力提高思想觉悟和文化技术水平。据统计，凡是已经制定出小组和个人规划的部门，职工群众的热情更加高涨了。许多职工不仅在规划中规定了个人今年内达到的生产指标，而且提出了达到指标的具体措施，订出了学习文化和争取入党入团的计划。许多工人小组还建立了检查制度，每天检查完成任务的情况，开展批评和自我批评。
