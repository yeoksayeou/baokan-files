To the Editor:

    More than a year ago, only a few people, such as Wang Hengcheng, a model worker in Liaoning Province, were able to complete more than 160% of their quota in Benxi Coal Mine. Now, more than 20% of the workers in the mine have reached this advanced level.

    Learning from advanced experience is the main reason why these workers have achieved success in production. Zhang Daishan, a coal miner in the Fifth Mining Area, worked with Wang Hengcheng last year and secretly competed with him. Because he only relied on brute force, he not only failed to beat Wang Hengcheng, but also had to rest for eight days due to exhaustion. This year, he and worker Xu Guangcai humbly learned Wang Hengcheng's "triangular bracing" and other operating methods, and completed 210% of the quota in February. The Tang Weixin Youth Group in the Sixth Mining Area completed 201% of the quota in February, an increase of more than 67% compared to January, due to learning Wang Hengcheng's operating methods and the "inclined slag bracing" operating methods of the Song Yuxiang Group of Benxi Caitun Coal Mine.

    With the acceleration of mining work, auxiliary production work is also catching up. The coal quality of Benxi Coal Mine is relatively soft, and a beam socket must be dug before mining. For decades, workers have been using hand picks, and it takes more than an hour to dig a beam socket. On March 23rd this year, the beam socket digging machine designed by veteran coal miner Yu Xiuting was successfully trial-produced. In this way, the process of digging beam sockets can be handled by a specialized drilling team, and at the same time, the number of prop legs and connecting beams can be reduced. Coal miners can save two to three hours of time, and have the conditions to implement four-shift staggered operations, which will double or triple the overall coal mining efficiency.

    Benxi Coal Mine, an old mine with more than 40 years of mining history, is showing a new look. The long-standing situation of cost overruns and uneven output in the first quarter has been changed. In February, the mine overproduced more than 10,000 tons of raw coal. Although the geological conditions changed greatly in March, the coal production figures in the first ten days exceeded the plan by more than 2,000 tons. Since January, costs have been reduced and accidents have also decreased.

### 20％以上的职工完成定额的160％

    20％以上的职工完成定额的160％编辑同志：
    在一年多以前，本溪煤矿只有辽宁省工业劳动模范王恒成等少数人能够完成160％以上的定额，现在全矿已经有20％以上的工人达到了这个先进水平。
    学习先进经验，是这些工人能够在生产中得到成绩的主要原因。第五回采区采煤工人张岱山去年和王恒成在一块干活，曾经在暗中和王恒成竞赛；因为他只是凭气力来拚，结果不但没有赛过王恒成，还累得歇了八天工。今年他和工人徐广才虚心地学习了王恒成“三角拉门”等操作方法，二月份就完成了定额210％。第六回采区唐维新青年小组由于学习了王恒成的操作方法和本溪彩屯煤矿宋玉祥小组“斜渣拉门”的操作方法，二月份完成定额201％，比一月提高了67％以上。
    随着采掘工作的加快，辅助生产的工作也在赶上去。本溪煤矿的煤质比较软，在采煤以前必须先掏个梁子窝。几十年来工人们都是用手镐刨，掏个梁子窝要花费一个多小时。今年三月二十三日，老采煤工人于秀廷设计的掏梁子窝的机器试制成功了。这样，掏梁子窝的工序可以由专门的打眼工作队担当，同时还可以减少棚腿和接梁子，采煤工人就可以节省两小时到三小时的时间，有条件实行四班交叉作业，使整个采煤效率提高了一倍到一倍半。
    本溪煤矿这座有四十多年开采历史的老矿山呈现了一片新气象。长期存在的第一季度成本超支和产量不均衡的状况已经改变了。二月份全矿超额生产原煤一万多吨，三月份虽然地质情况变化很大，但是上旬的产煤数字就超过计划两千多吨。从一月份起，成本降低了，事故也减少了。
