Xinjiang to Establish First Bee Farm

    Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region's first state-owned bee farm is being prepared in Mohegou, Gongliu County, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. This bee farm will have 300 hives of bees and will plant 500 mu of rapeseed and other good insect-pollinated flower crops. In addition to producing honey for the state every year, this bee farm will also breed bees and promote them to various places in a planned way.
    Ili white honey is sweet, fragrant, and pure white, and is one of the famous specialties of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Ili River valley has extensive orchards and wild fruit forests covering the mountains and plains. There are also more than 400,000 mu of rapeseed, and in spring and summer, flowers bloom everywhere, allowing bees to have a longer production season and good growing conditions.

    新疆筹建第一个养蜂场
    新疆维吾尔自治区的第一个国营养蜂场正在伊犁哈萨克族自治州的巩留县莫合沟着手筹建。这个养蜂场将拥有三百箱蜜蜂，并且种植五百亩油菜等良好的虫媒花作物。这个养蜂场除了每年为国家生产蜂蜜外，还要繁殖蜜蜂，并且有计划地向各地推广。
    伊犁白蜂蜜香甜白净，是新疆维吾尔自治区著名特产之一。伊犁河谷一带，有成片的果园，野生果林漫山遍野。还有四十多万亩油菜，春夏两季，到处花开似锦，蜜蜂能有较长的生产季节和良好的生长条件。
