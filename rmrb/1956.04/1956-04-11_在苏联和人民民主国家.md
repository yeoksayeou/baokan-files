In the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries

    Soviet Union Designs Solar Power Station

    Recently, scientists at the Solar Laboratory of the Power Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences have drawn up blueprints for a unique building: a solar power station.

    According to preliminary designs, this power station can provide approximately eleven tons of steam with a pressure of thirty to thirty-five atmospheres and a temperature of 400 degrees Celsius per hour. This steam can be used to drive a turbine with a generating capacity of 1,200 kilowatts. The electricity produced by the power station can be used to lift water from lower to higher elevations and then transport it to irrigate land in desert and semi-desert regions. The waste steam from the power station can also be used to produce ice, up to nineteen tons per hour.

    Korean Rural Areas Expand Mechanized Sowing

    Agricultural machinery rental stations throughout Korea began spring plowing and sowing for farmers in late March. The number of tractors participating in spring plowing and sowing this spring increased by 953 compared to last spring (each standard unit rated at fifteen horsepower), and a large number of sowing machines were also added. It is estimated that the area cultivated by machinery this spring will increase by more than 83,000 cho (1 cho is approximately 15 Chinese mu) compared to last year, and the area sown by machinery will increase by more than 14,000 cho compared to last year.

    Hwanghae-namdo Province, which is rich in rice, will plow more than 50,000 cho with tractors this spring, accounting for 18% of the province's total cultivated area. The area mechanically sown in Hamgyong-namdo Province this spring has increased more than twentyfold compared to last year.

    Vietnamese Key Factories and Mines Complete First Quarter Production Plans

    The major factories and mines of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have all completed or overfulfilled their production plans for the first three months of this year.

    The Vietnam State-owned Hong Gai Coal Enterprise overfulfilled its plan by 4%; coal production in other mines, such as Mao Khe, also exceeded planned targets.

    The Haiphong Cement Plant's output exceeded the original plan by 7.8%. Phosphate plants in Thanh Hoa, Yi An, and other places, as well as the Huang Van Shu Paper Mill and some factories in Hanoi, also overfulfilled their production plans. The output of yarn and silk at the Nam Dinh Textile Mill also exceeded the production plan.

    Poland Implements Seven-Year Compulsory Education Nationwide

    The State Council of the Polish People's Republic has promulgated a decree stipulating that seven-year compulsory education shall be universally implemented in all cities and villages throughout Poland.

    The decree stipulates that children in all cities and villages should receive at least seven years of basic education. Young people under the age of fourteen who have not yet received seven years of education must continue their studies until the age of sixteen. Young people between the ages of fourteen and sixteen who are currently learning various industrial skills must also complete at least seven academic years of courses at young workers' schools.

    The decree also stipulates that parents of children have a responsibility to ensure that their children receive education, and the chairmen of people's councils at all levels, schools, and enterprise leaders have a responsibility to ensure that the relevant compulsory education provisions are observed.

    Czech Agricultural Cooperatives Develop Rapidly

    Since the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party adopted the resolution on the socialist development of agriculture in the future in June 1955, Czechoslovakia has established more than 1,260 new unified agricultural cooperatives and cooperative preparatory committees. From January 1 to March 20, in the Czech region alone, 612 new unified agricultural cooperatives and more than 70 cooperative preparatory committees were established.

    Romania Establishes More Than 1,000 Agricultural Cooperatives in Two Months

    Romania established approximately 1,100 new collective farms and joint cultivation societies in the first two months of this year, which is equivalent to the total number established in the entire year of 1955. More than 40 villages in Constanta region have now been fully collectivized.

    Bulgaria's Electricity Generation This Year Will Increase Ninefold Compared to Pre-War Levels

    Bulgaria's electricity generation this year will increase to 2.327 billion kilowatt-hours, which is nine times the level of 1939 before liberation. According to the 1956 economic plan, Bulgaria's electricity supply to residents this year will increase by 15% compared to 1955.

    During this year alone, the following power stations will begin generating electricity throughout Bulgaria: the "Passarel" and "Kokalyane" hydropower stations, another part of the Stalin thermal power station, and the "Iskar" and "Petrohan" hydropower stations, among others.

    In order to fully utilize hydropower resources for electricity generation, Bulgarian engineers have designed a power system including twelve hydropower stations for a 220-kilometer stretch of the Arda River flowing through the country. After these hydropower stations are completed, the electricity they generate will be approximately equivalent to half of the electricity currently generated by all power stations in the country. At present, construction has begun on the first hydropower station and reservoir in the middle reaches of this river. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    在苏联和人民民主国家
    苏联设计出日光电力站
    最近，苏联科学院动力研究所日光实验室的科学工作者们，绘制了一项独特的建筑物——日光电力站的蓝图。
    根据初步设计，这个电力站每小时可以提供十一吨左右有三十到三十五大气压和四百度温度的蒸气。这种蒸气可以用来推动发电能力为一千二百瓩的涡轮机。利用电力站所生产的电力，可以把水从低处提到高处，然后输送出去，以灌溉沙漠和半沙漠地区的土地。电力站的废汽还可以用来制造冰块，每小时可以制造十九吨。
    朝鲜农村机械播种面积扩大
    朝鲜各地的农业机械代耕站三月下旬陆续开始为农民春耕、播种。今春参加春耕、播种的拖拉机比去年春天增加了九百五十三台（每标准台十五匹马力），另外还增加了大量的播种机。预计今春机耕面积可比去年增加八万三千多町步（一町步约合十五市亩），用机械播种的面积可比去年增加一万四千多町步。
    盛产大米的黄海南道今春将用拖拉机耕地五万多町步，占全道耕地总面积的18％。咸镜南道今春的机械播种面积比去年增加了二十倍以上。
    越主要厂矿完成第一季生产计划
    越南民主共和国的主要厂矿都完成或超额完成了今年头三个月的生产计划。
    越南国营鸿基煤炭企业超额4％完成了计划；其他如冒溪等煤矿的采煤量，也都超过了预定计划。
    海防水泥厂的产量比原计划超过了7.8％。超额完成生产计划的还有清化、宜安等地的磷酸盐厂，黄文树造纸厂以及河内市的一些工厂。南定纺织厂的纱、绸产量也超过了生产计划。
    波全国实行七年制义务教育
    波兰人民共和国国务委员会颁布了一项法令，规定波兰全国的一切城市和乡村都要普遍实施七年制义务教育。
    法令规定：一切城市和乡村的儿童应当至少受七年的基本教育。还没有受过七年教育的十四岁以下的青年，一定要继续学习到十六岁。目前正在学习各种行业的技术的十四岁到十六岁的青年，也要在青年工人学校里至少学完七个学年的课程。
    法令还规定儿童的父母有责任保证子女能够受到教育，各级人民会议主席团、学校和企业的负责人有责任使有关义务教育的规定得到遵守。
    捷农业合作社迅速发展
    自从1955年6月捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会通过关于今后农业的社会主义发展的决议以来，捷克斯洛伐克已经成立了一千二百六十多个新的统一农业合作社和合作社筹备委员会。从一月一日到三月二十日，单是在捷克地区就成立了六百一十二个新的统一农业合作社和七十多个合作社筹备委员会。
    罗两月内成立一千多个农业社
    罗马尼亚在今年头两个月中约成立了一千一百个新的集体农庄和联合耕种社，这相当于1955年全年成立的总数。康斯坦萨州目前已经有四十多个农村全部合作化了。
    保今年发电量将增为战前的九倍
    保加利亚今年的发电量将增加到二十三亿二千七百万度，即增为解放前1939年的九倍。根据1956年经济计划规定，保加利亚今年供应居民的电力将比1955年增加15％。
    在今年一年中，保加利亚全国开始发电的电力站将有：“帕萨列尔”和“科卡利亚涅”两个水电站，斯大林电热站的另一部分，“伊斯克尔”和“彼得罗汉”水电站等。
    为了充分利用水力资源发电，保加利亚工程师已经为阿尔达河流经境内的二百二十公里长的一段河流设计好包括十二个水电站的电力系统。这些水电站建成以后，它们所发出的电力约相当于目前全国所有电力站所发出的电力的一半。目前，这条河流中游的第一个水电站和水库已经开始动工兴建了。　（据新华社讯）
