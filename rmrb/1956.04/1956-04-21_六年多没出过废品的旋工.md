    Xinhua News Agency report:

    Yan Junli, a lathe operator at the state-owned Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory, has not produced any scrap products for over six years, from March 1950 to the present, and has consistently met or exceeded his monthly production targets.

    Yan Junli diligently wipes, inspects, and oils the machine tools he uses, ensuring their normal operation. Every time he receives a blueprint, he carefully studies the dimensions section by section to avoid scrap caused by unclear or incorrect blueprints. During the machining process, he also constantly adjusts the angle of the cutting tool according to the characteristics of the machine tool and the hardness of the workpiece.

    六年多没出过废品的旋工
    国营石家庄货车修理工厂旋床工人阎俊礼，从1950年3月到现在，已经六年多没有出过废品，并且月月完成或超额完成生产任务。
    阎俊礼对自己使用的机床勤擦、勤检查、勤上油，保证了机器的运转正常。每当他接到图纸以后，就分段分部地仔细研究图纸上的尺寸，避免了因图纸不清或图纸错误而造成废品。在加工过程中，他还根据机床的特点和工作物的软硬度，随时改变刀的角度。（据新华社讯）
