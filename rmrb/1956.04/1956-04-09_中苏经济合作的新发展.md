    New Developments in Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation

    During the visit of the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, to our country, two agreements on further development of economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union have been signed with our government. One agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will assist our country in building another 55 new industrial enterprises, including extremely valuable metallurgical plants, machine-building factories and chemical plants, electrical technology and radio technology industrial enterprises, and synthetic liquid fuel plants; this agreement also stipulates the expansion of assistance to our country in geological work. The other agreement stipulates the construction of a railway from Lanzhou to the Aktogai station of the Turkestan-Siberian Railway and the organization of joint transportation on this railway starting from 1960. This represents an important development in Sino-Soviet economic cooperation and close friendship. The Chinese people warmly welcome these two agreements and sincerely thank the Soviet Union for this new sincere and selfless assistance to our country. This action by the Soviet government is entirely beneficial to strengthening international cooperation and defending world peace.
    In the socialist construction, the Chinese people have repeatedly received huge and selfless assistance from the Soviet government and people. We can never forget that when our young People's Republic was in a difficult period of restoring the national economy, the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements between China and the Soviet Union, provided assistance to our country through various means such as loans, trade, dispatching experts, and supplying equipment. In 1953, when our country began the large-scale construction of the First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union again helped our country build 156 industrial enterprises and 21 separate workshops with equipment totaling approximately 5.6 billion rubles. These important industrial enterprises have become the center of industrial construction in our country's First Five-Year Plan, and their construction has laid a solid foundation for our country's socialist industrialization. Now, as our people are working hard to complete and over fulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and are actively preparing for the Second Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union is again assisting our country with greater strength. There is no doubt that this new assistance will further accelerate the development of our country's socialist construction and further strengthen the close fraternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.
    The railway from Jining to Ulan Bator, which was built according to the agreement signed by the governments of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia in 1954, has already begun international joint transportation in January this year. The conclusion of the agreement on the construction of the railway from Lanzhou to Aktogai and the organization of joint transportation starting from 1960 has added a direct transportation route between China and the Soviet Union. This will not only greatly accelerate our country's economic construction, but also further develop cooperation and mutual support between China and the Soviet Union, and increase our country's economic and cultural ties with many European countries.
    The signing of the two agreements between China and the Soviet Union on further development of economic cooperation profoundly embodies the new type of international relations between socialist countries. The development of economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union will promote the common upsurge of the economies of the two countries, thereby strengthening the power of the entire socialist camp and the forces defending world peace.
    In the new assistance given to our country by the Soviet government and people, the Chinese people have once again realized that the Soviet Union is the most loyal and reliable friend of the Chinese people. At present, our country is in the high tide of socialist transformation and socialist construction. The selfless assistance given to our country by the Soviet government and people has played and will continue to play a huge role in our country's socialist construction. Our people will cherish the assistance from the Soviet Union and take the socialist and communist construction of the Soviet people as an example, and strive to complete our country's socialist construction as soon as possible.
    The Soviet Union is not only willing to help China and other people's democratic countries realize their national industrialization, but also willing to help other economically underdeveloped countries develop their own industries in order to safeguard their national independence and improve the living standards of the people. In order to further strengthen economic cooperation with Asia, the Soviet delegation headed by Comrade Mikoyan held talks or signed agreements with some countries during its visit to many Asian countries. The friendly visit of the Soviet government delegation to many Asian countries promoted mutual understanding and trust between the Soviet Union and these countries, strengthened the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and these countries, and enhanced the prospects for peace in Asia and the world. While congratulating China and the Soviet Union on the signing of new agreements, the Chinese people warmly welcome the further strengthening of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and various Asian countries.

    中苏经济合作的新发展
    以苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬同志为首的苏联政府代表团在访问我国期间，已经同我国政府签订了关于进一步发展中苏两国经济发展的两项协定。一项协定规定苏联帮助我国再兴建五十五项新的工业企业，这些企业中包括极贵重的冶金工厂，机器制造工厂和化学工厂，电气技术和无线电技术工业企业以及人造液体燃料工厂等设备；这个协定并规定在进行地质工作方面扩大对我国的援助。另一项协定规定修建从兰州到土耳克斯坦—西伯利亚铁路的阿克斗卡站的铁路和从1960年起组织这条铁路的联运。这是中苏两国经济合作和亲密友谊的重要发展。中国人民热烈欢迎这两项协定，并且衷心感谢苏联对我国这种真诚无私的新的援助。苏联政府的这种行动对于加强国际合作和保卫世界和平的事业是完全有利的。
    中国人民在社会主义建设中，一再受到苏联政府和人民的巨大无私的援助。我们永远不能忘记，当我们年轻的人民共和国在恢复国民经济的困难时期，苏联曾根据中苏友好同盟互助条约以及中苏两国之间的其他协定，通过贷款、贸易、派遣专家、供应设备等各种方式对我国进行了援助。1953年我国开始实行第一个五年计划的大规模建设，这时候苏联又帮助我国建设设备总值约为五十六亿卢布的一百五十六项工业企业和二十一个单独车间。这些重要的工业企业已成为我国第一个五年计划中工业建设的中心，这些工业企业的建设已经为我国的社会主义工业化打下了坚强的基础。现在，当我国人民正在紧张地为提前并超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划的时候，苏联又以更大的力量来援助我国。毫无疑义，这些新的援助将更加加速我国社会主义建设事业的发展，更加加强中苏两国人民亲密的兄弟友谊。
    根据1954年中苏蒙三国政府签订的协定而修建的集宁到乌兰巴托的铁路已经于今年一月开始国际联运。这次关于修建从兰州到阿克斗卡的铁路和从1960年开始组织联运的协定的缔结，又使中苏两国增加一条直接交通路线，这不仅将大大加快我国的经济建设，而且将更进一步发展中苏两国的合作和互相支援，增加我国同欧洲许多国家的经济和文化的联系。
  中苏两国关于进一步发展经济合作的两项协定的签订，深刻地体现了社会主义国家之间的新型国际关系。中苏两国的经济合作的发展将促进两国经济的共同高涨，从而加强整个社会主义阵营的威力和保卫世界和平的力量。
    在苏联政府和人民给予我国的新的援助中，中国人民再一次体会到苏联是中国人民的最忠实可靠的朋友。目前我国正处于社会主义改造和社会主义建设的高潮中。苏联政府和人民给予我国的无私的援助，已经在并将继续在我国社会主义建设事业中发生巨大的作用。我国人民将十分珍视苏联的援助，并且以苏联人民的社会主义和共产主义建设为榜样，努力争取早日完成我国的社会主义建设事业。
    苏联不仅愿意帮助中国以及其他人民民主国家实现自己的国家工业化，而且愿意帮助其他经济不发达的国家发展本国的工业，以便保障它们国家的独立和提高人民的生活水平。为了进一步加强同亚洲的经济合作关系，以米高扬同志为首的苏联代表团在访问许多亚洲国家期间，曾同一些国家进行了会谈或签订了协定。苏联政府代表团对许多亚洲国家的友好访问，促进了苏联同这些国家的相互了解和信任，加强了苏联同这些国家的友好关系，增进了亚洲和世界和平的前景。中国人民在祝贺中苏两国签订新协定的同时，热烈欢迎苏联同亚洲各国友好关系的进一步加强。
