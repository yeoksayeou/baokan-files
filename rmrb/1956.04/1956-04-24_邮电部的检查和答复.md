    Inspection and Reply from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
    Regarding the difficulties encountered by the Railway Ministry's Engineering Study Class in subscribing to newspapers at the Tongxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau, our investigation has confirmed that this is entirely true. Moreover, the situation at the Tongxian Post Office is not an isolated case.
    This is mainly because we have not done enough in the political and ideological education of our staff, especially in conscientiously implementing the "subscription of newspapers and periodicals at any time, for broken months and broken seasons" method. Our prescribed procedures for subscribing to newspapers and periodicals also have shortcomings. For example, although it has been stipulated that for post offices bordering areas where newspapers and periodicals are distributed, the provincial bureau and the distributing bureau can negotiate changes, there are no specific measures. In addition, the grassroots units of the postal and telecommunications departments are weak, and social newspaper and periodical promotion stations have not been universally established, which makes it difficult for readers to subscribe to and purchase newspapers and periodicals.
    In addition to instructing the Hebei Post and Telecommunications Administration to seriously deal with the relevant personnel of the Tongxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau, educate all employees, establish the idea of serving the masses, and improve their work, we are also issuing a circular to the national postal and telecommunications system. At the same time, in accordance with the spirit of the Third National Newspaper and Periodical Promotion Work Conference, we will appropriately equip promotion forces, vigorously organize social newspaper and periodical promotion stations; urge subordinate units to strengthen the work of receiving subscriptions and retailing newspapers and periodicals, and appropriately change procedures to meet the needs of readers.

    邮电部的检查和答复
    关于铁道部工务学习班在通县邮电局订阅报纸遇到困难，经我们派人检查，证明完全属实。而且像通县邮局那样的现象，还不是个别的。
    这主要是我们对职工的政治思想教育，特别是认真贯彻执行“随时起讫报刊，破月破季订阅”办法的教育做得不够。我们规定的订阅报刊手续制度也有缺点，如对部分和发报刊局地区相接壤的邮局，虽然曾规定过可由省局和发报刊局协商变动处理，但是缺乏具体的措施。再加上邮电部门基层单位的力量薄弱，社会报刊推广站也没有普遍建立起来，就使读者感到订阅和零购报刊有困难。
    我们除责成河北邮电管理局对通县邮电局有关人员进行严肃处理，教育全体职工，树立为群众服务的思想，改进工作外，并且通报全国邮电系统。同时根据第三次全国报刊推广工作会议的精神，将适当配备推广力量，大力组织社会报刊推广站；督促所属单位加强收订和零售报刊的工作，适当改变手续制度，以适应读者的需要。
