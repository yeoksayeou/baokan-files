    Six Years on the Tibetan Plateau
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Qi
    In Tibet, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is greeting its sixth spring on the Tibetan Plateau with outstanding achievements in production and construction. In various important towns on the plateau, in river valleys hemmed in by mountains, in uninhabited high-altitude cold regions, and in primeval forests, PLA soldiers are diligently working and living happily. They are the vanguards of various constructions in Tibet.
    Not long ago, soldiers participating in transportation construction sent out exciting news: together with workers of various ethnic groups, they have built a highway to the foot of the Himalayas. That place is more than 2,000 kilometers away from the west bank of the Jinsha River, bordering Sichuan Province. The Tibet region has overlapping mountains and turbulent rivers, and transportation is very difficult, which has long hindered the development of the Tibetan people. Over the past six years, officers and soldiers have put in tremendous labor to change the transportation conditions in Tibet. Countless hammers have been cracked, and countless steel drills have been worn down; the heroic saying of "making high mountains bow their heads and making rivers give way" fully demonstrates the strong will of the People's Liberation Army to overcome difficulties. They have opened up more than 20 mountains with an altitude of four to five thousand meters above sea level, and built bridges over hundreds of turbulent rivers. Many officers and soldiers have lived in tents in the mountains and grasslands for a full five years. The iron and wood factory established by the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Lhasa has produced more than 100,000 pieces of road construction equipment, as well as some carriages, for the Kangzang Highway. These products did not exist in Tibet in the past.
    Now, the transportation conditions in the Tibet region have been greatly improved. On the five main highway lines, drivers of the automobile troops are continuously transporting various materials and construction equipment to various construction sites. They often travel regardless of wind and snow, and sometimes even travel day and night. Over the past few years, they have overcome numerous difficulties such as freezing, landslides, floods, and quicksand. The mileage they have traveled can circle the earth several times. In many remote deep mountain canyons, on the post roads and trails built by soldiers, mule caravans and yak teams carrying daily necessities and local and special products of the Tibetan people are also shuttling back and forth.
    In the season when the spring warms up and the snow melts, on the fields of the Lhasa Plain and the Bomi River Valley, soldiers are using tractors to pull large-scale agricultural machinery to cultivate wasteland and sow seeds. Building a new Tibet for the motherland is their unanimous wish. As early as 1950, when marching towards Tibet, the soldiers carried crop seeds in their backpacks ready to be sown on Tibetan soil. Over the past few years, they have reclaimed more than 40,000 mu of wasteland with shovels and pickaxes, planted abundant crops on many barren beaches separated by rivers, and successfully trial-planted crop varieties that had never grown on the plateau before. In Lhasa, they established Tibet's first farm; on the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, their wheat yield averaged 288 jin per mu; and in Ali, which has a high and cold terrain, highland barley also achieved a bumper harvest. When they first entered Tibet, the officers and soldiers could hardly eat any vegetables, and the doctors were also worried about the health of the officers and soldiers. Now, radishes weighing more than forty jin and Chinese cabbages weighing more than thirty jin grow in the fields, and they cannot finish eating the various vegetables they have grown themselves. The soldiers also sent many new crop varieties to the local Tibetan farmers and taught them production techniques.
    Whenever the Tibetan people encounter emergencies, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army always help them selflessly. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Tibetan people who suffered from natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and forest fires were rescued and helped by the People's Liberation Army in coordination with the political power organs, and rebuilt new homes. Troops stationed in various places also often help Tibetan people cultivate crops, build canals, and build houses. When they transfer their garrisons, they give their newly opened vegetable gardens and wasteland to the Tibetan people. Medical workers of the troops often provide free medical treatment for Tibetan people. From 1952 to 1954, medical workers from the troops stationed west of Tai Zhao alone treated more than 80,000 Tibetan people.
    In the cause of building Tibet, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have formed the closest friendship with the Tibetan people. Many stories and tales of unity between the army and the people are circulating in the countryside and pastures. On the Kangzang Highway, the following song is popular among Tibetan migrant workers:
    "Hadas don't need too many,
    One white one is enough;
    Friends don't need too many,
    Knowing a PLA soldier is enough."
    Over the past six years, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet have realized their determination to help the Tibetan people build a new life. A large number of officers and soldiers have been commended for their outstanding contributions to the construction of Tibet, and some officers and soldiers have given their lives for the happiness of the Tibetan people. Now, from the Jinsha River in eastern Tibet to the Ali region in western Tibet, from the Tanggula Mountains to the Himalayan Mountains, the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army are everywhere.

### 康藏高原上的六年

    康藏高原上的六年
    新华社记者　赵奇
    在西藏，中国人民解放军正以生产建设上的优异成绩，迎接进驻西藏高原后的第六个春天。在高原上的各个重要城镇、山峰夹峙的河谷地带、荒无人烟的高寒山区和原始森林里，到处都有人民解放军的官兵们在辛勤地劳动着，在愉快地生活着。他们是西藏各项建设的先锋。
    不久以前，参加交通建设的士兵传出了振奋人心的捷报：他们和各族工人一起，已经把公路修到喜马拉雅山下。那里距离和四川省接壤的金沙江西岸有两千多公里。西藏地区山峰重叠、激流纵横，交通十分困难；长期阻碍着西藏人民的发展。六年来，官兵们为了改变西藏的交通条件付出了巨大的劳动。无数的铁锤被震裂了，无数的钢钎被磨秃了；“叫高山低头、叫河水让路”的英雄名言，充分表现了人民解放军克服困难的坚强意志。他们打通了二十几座拔海四、五千公尺的大山，在成百条的激流上架起了桥梁。许多官兵在山岭和草原上，整整过了五年的帐篷生活。中国人民解放军西藏军区在拉萨建立的铁木工厂，就曾经为康藏公路制出十万多件筑路器材，以及一些马车等等。这些产品都是西藏过去没有的。
    现在，西藏地区的交通条件已经大大的改善了。在五条公路干线上，汽车部队的驾驶员们正在源源不断地把各种物资和建筑器材运到各建设工地。他们常常风雪无阻，有时候甚至日夜行车，几年来，克服了冰冻、坍方、洪水、流砂等重重困难，所行驶的里程可以绕地球好几周。在许多边远的深山峡谷里，士兵们所修筑的驿道和便道上，也来往着驮运藏民生活用品和土产品和特产品的骡帮和牦牛队。
    春暖雪消的季节里，拉萨平原和波密河谷的田野上，士兵们正在用拖拉机拉着大型农业机器垦荒、播种。建设祖国的新西藏是他们一致的愿望。远在1950年向西藏进军时，战士们的背包里就装着准备在西藏土地上播种的农作物种籽。几年来，他们曾经用铁锹和十字镐开垦了四万多亩荒地，在许多被河水分割开来的荒滩上栽种了丰美的庄稼，把高原上从来没有生长过的作物品种试种成功。在拉萨，他们建立了西藏的第一个农场；在雅鲁藏布江边，他们种植的小麦，平均每亩收到288斤；在地势高寒的阿里，青稞也得到了丰收。开始进藏时，官兵们几乎吃不上一点青菜，医生也忧虑着官兵们的健康。现在，地里长出了四十多斤重的萝卜和三十多斤重的莲花白菜，他们亲手种植的各种菜蔬都吃不完。士兵们还把许多新的作物品种送给当地的藏族农民，并且传授了生产技术。
    每当藏族人民遇到急难的时候，中国人民解放军的官兵总是奋不顾身的去帮助他们。西藏和平解放后，遭受洪水、地震和森林失火等自然灾害的藏族人民，都在人民解放军配合政权机关抢救和帮助下，重新建设了新的家园。驻各地部队还经常帮助藏族人民耕种庄稼、兴修水渠和修盖房屋。他们转移驻地时，就把自己新开的菜园和荒地赠送给藏族人民。部队的医务工作者，常常为藏族人民免费医治疾病。从1952年到1954年，仅驻太昭以西的部队医务工作者就给藏族人民治病八万多人次。
    中国人民解放军的官兵们在建设西藏的事业中，和藏族人民结成了最亲密的朋友。许多军民团结的故事和佳话流传在农村和牧场上。在康藏公路线上，藏族民工中就流行着这样的歌子：
    “哈达不要太多，
    有一条洁白的就好；
    朋友不要太多，
    认识一个解放军就行。”
    六年来，进驻西藏的中国人民解放军官兵们实现了帮助藏族人民建设新生活的决心。大批军官和士兵因为对西藏建设有卓越贡献立了功，有一些官兵为藏族人民的幸福献出了生命。现在，从西藏东部的金沙江岸到西部的阿里地区，从唐古拉山到喜马拉雅山区，到处留下了人民解放军的英雄业迹。
