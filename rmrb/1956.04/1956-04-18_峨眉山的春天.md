    Spring on Mount Emei
    By our staff reporter Ji Xichen
    After crossing the clear Qingyi River, Mount Emei comes into view from afar. “Emei is the fairest under heaven.” The magnificent peaks resemble two beautiful, thick eyebrows, painted on the clear sky. The Golden Summit, towering above the mountains, wears a mist-covered turban, piercing straight into the sky, while the rising clouds resemble countless flocks of white doves, flying around among the thousands of peaks and valleys. In the plains on both sides of the mountain road, the eared wheat rolls in waves, the rapeseed flowers shine with golden light, and tender green seedlings have already sprouted in the plowed double-cropping rice paddies.

    In March, although the majestic mountain peaks are still covered with a thin layer of snow, azaleas, peach blossoms, and crabapple flowers, like colorful clouds, have filled the entire mountain. On the verdant peaks and unusual ridges that stretch for one hundred and twenty li from the foot to the summit of the mountain at an altitude of 3,100 meters above sea level, the waterfalls of Dragon Gate Gorge, the rapids under Double Flying Bridge, the moonlight over Elephant Washing Pool, the deep valley dawn rain of Hongchunping, and many scenic spots like brocade paintings, and dozens of renovated Buddhist temples and ancient sites, receive visitors earlier than any other year in the bright spring light. Every year, tens of thousands of tourists from all over the country and some foreign friends come to visit "the most famous mountain under heaven."

    The winding, perilous path of Drilling Slope, the strange peaks around Lotus Stone that resemble blooming blue lotuses, and the clean blue sky covering the canyon fill people's hearts with openness, comfort, and contentment! Higher up, on the highest peak of the mountain, the Golden Summit, one can look far into the snow-capped mountains of Tibet, overlook the rolling sea of clouds below, see the wonders of sunrise and sunset, and observe the five-colored, mirror-like "Buddha's light" appearing in the clouds and mist under the reflection of sunlight. When night falls, one can also see the flickering "Buddha's lamps" of phosphorus fire moving under the towering cliffs.

    Mount Emei also has rich deposits of phosphate, coal, and iron ore, as well as boundless primeval forests of fir, Phoebe, and pine. Among the more than three thousand kinds of plants on the mountain, only six hundred have been named. The snow-white dove tree flowers and the bright rhododendrons are rare plants in the world. Every year, Chinese and foreign botanists and zoologists come to investigate and study them. There are more than 160 kinds of famous local products sold at home and abroad, such as white wax, Coptis chinensis, Achyranthes bidentata, and silk. With the loan assistance and technical guidance of the People's Government, the production of white wax, silk, Coptis chinensis, and other specialties, which had stagnated before liberation, has gradually recovered. Coptis chinensis, which is harvested only once every three to five years, produced more than 13,000 jin in 1955. The output of white wax, used as a special industrial raw material, reached 175,000 jin in 1955, an increase of six times compared to 1950.

    Crossing the towering mountains, I visited Jingshui Township, surrounded by mountains, at an altitude of more than 1,000 meters. In the misty valleys, people are busy with spring plowing everywhere, up and down. This year, the farmers broke with convention and sowed seeds of two-crop corn in the moist soil opened in the waist-deep broad bean fields, which will increase the yield of corn per mu from 500 jin to 800 jin. The members of the agricultural cooperative also climbed to the steep slopes and reclaimed more than 400 mu of wasteland among the trees and rocks; they split the sloping mountain land into layers of terraced fields and then used connected bamboo tubes to divert mountain springs into the fields. In order to open up fertilizer sources, the Party branch mobilized four or five hundred people to go to the high mountains more than fifty li away, and excavated more than 120,000 jin of swallow droppings and bird droppings in the ancient Jiulao Cave. With these few items alone, the township will increase grain production by more than 300,000 jin this year.

    The roar of automobile engines and machines broke the silence of the mountain dawn. The workers of Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Factory and Qianghua Iron Factory are mining, smelting iron, and producing phosphate fertilizer in the high mountains and deep valleys day and night. Hundreds and thousands of tons of phosphate fertilizer are shipped from Mount Emei to various places every day.

    "Ten thousand bright lamps face Samantabhadra." The farmers who used to believe that the phosphorescent light at night was a "divine lamp" and that whoever saw the "divine lamp" would have happiness, now laugh and say: "We often saw 'divine lamps' before liberation, but life became poorer and poorer. Now we don't believe in 'divine lamps,' but use phosphate fertilizer on the land, and we have good harvests every year!" Phosphate fertilizer is widely welcomed by farmers. Although the planned production of 130,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer this year has increased six and a half times compared to last year, it still cannot meet the needs of the vast number of farmers. The phosphate fertilizer plant is now undergoing a large-scale expansion project. A newly built factory with an annual output of 350,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer and an aerial cableway extending 16 kilometers from the mining area to the factory building have already started construction. The light railway from Mount Emei to the mouth of the Dadu River will also begin construction soon.

    Mount Emei has many streams and waterfalls. The beautiful Dragon Pool Lake is said to be formed by the water spit out by the "Dragon King," but it is actually a lake formed by the convergence of many waterfalls and rapids on Mount Emei. In the past, whenever mountain floods broke out, the Yan'er River, Liudao River, Guanyin River, etc. would overflow into disasters. Now, taking advantage of its many water heads and large flow differences, the Longchi Multi-Level Hydropower Station is being built on the western wing of Mount Emei. Not long ago, this place was still barren, but now electric lights shine at night, rows of new houses have been built, and trucks loaded with machinery and materials are constantly running back and forth. Thousands of workers and laborers are rushing to repair the dam, diversion canals, and power plant dam foundation, striving to start generating electricity in November 1956. After the entire project is completed, it can generate about 25,000 kilowatts. It will form a power transmission network with the Minjiang Power Plant, supplying electricity to many factories and mines and providing lighting for residents in Emei, Leshan, and other places. At that time, the Emei Mountain area, which covers more than a thousand li, will become even more beautiful and prosperous!

    峨眉山的春天
    本报记者　纪希晨
    渡过清彻的青衣江，老远就可望见峨眉山。“峨眉天下秀”，雄伟的山峰宛如两道秀丽的浓眉，描绘在澄洁的天空上面；耸立在群山之上的金顶，围戴着雾巾直插青天，而团团升起的行云则宛如无数群白鸽，飞绕在千峰万峪之间。山下公路两边的平原上，吐穗的麦子滚动着波浪，油菜花闪耀着金光，翻耕过的双季稻秧田里，已经长出了嫩绿的秧苗。
    三月，巍峨的山巅虽然还罩着薄雪，可是彩霞似的杜鹃花、春桃花和山海棠已开满了全山。在拔海三千一百公尺、从山脚到山顶长达一百二十华里的翠岗奇峰上，龙门峡的瀑布，双飞桥下的激流，洗象池的夜月，洪春坪的深谷晓雨，千年古洞九老洞等许多如锦似画的名胜，和几十座修整得焕然一新的佛寺古迹，在明媚的春光里，比哪一年都更早地接待了游人。来自全国各地的游人和一些外国友人，前来“天下名山”游览的每年都达数万人。
    钻天坡上千折万转的盘空险道，莲花石四周那宛如朵朵青莲的奇峰和复盖在峡谷上面静洁的蓝色的天空，多么使人心胸开旷、舒畅和惬意啊！再高一些，上到山的最高峰金顶上，可以远眺西藏的雪山，伏瞰身下连绵起伏的云涛，看日出、日落的奇景，观察阳光反射下云雾中出现的五彩若镜的“佛光”。当黑夜降临的时候，还可以看到游动在万丈峭壁下磷火闪闪的“佛灯”。
    峨眉山还有蕴藏丰富的磷矿、煤矿、铁矿，也有杉树、楠木、松柏的无边的原始森林。山上的三千多种植物中，有名字的只有六百多种。雪白的栱桐花，鲜艳的?罗花，都是世界罕有的植物。每年都有中外动植物学家前来考查研究。畅销国内外的白腊，黄连，牛夕，蚕丝等有名的土特产，山中就有一百六十多种。在人民政府贷款扶助和技术指导下，解放前生产陷于停顿的白腊，蚕丝，黄连等特产，逐渐得到了恢复。三、五年才收获一季的黄连，1955年年产一万三千多斤，作为特种工业原料的白腊，1955年产量达十七万五千斤，比1950年增加了六倍。
    越过重重峻岭，在拔海一千多公尺的高山上，我访问了群山环抱的净水乡。云雾弥漫的山谷里，上上下下到处是忙着春耕的人群。农民们今年打破惯例在齐腰深的葫豆地里，掏开湿润的泥土，撒种下一年两熟的包谷，将使每亩包谷产量由五百斤提高到八百斤。农业社社员还攀登到陡立的坡崖上，在树丛乱石间开垦了四百多亩荒地；把倾斜的山坡地劈成一层层的梯田和梯地，然后用衔接起来的竹筒，将山泉引灌到田地里。为了开辟肥源，党支部发动四五百群众，上到五十多里的高山上，在千年古洞九老洞内，掏挖了十二万多斤燕屎鸟粪。单单这几项，全乡今年就能增产粮食三十多万斤。
    汽车马达和机器的吼声，打破了山间黎明的沉寂。乐山磷肥厂，强华铁厂等厂矿的职工们，日夜在高山深谷间进行开矿，炼铁和磷肥的生产。每天都有成百成千吨的磷肥从峨眉山运向各地。
    “万盏明灯朝普贤”，从前那些把夜间磷光发亮传说为“神灯”，认为谁看到了“神灯”谁就会有幸福的农民，现在都笑着说：“解放前我们也常常看到‘神灯’，可是日子越过越穷，如今不相信‘神灯’，用磷肥来上地，年年都有好收成！”磷肥普遍受到农民的欢迎。今年计划生产的十三万吨磷肥，虽然已比去年增加六倍半，可是仍不能满足广大农民的需要。磷肥厂矿现在正进行大规模的扩建工程。新建立的一个年产三十五万吨磷肥的工厂，和从矿区到厂房长达十六公里的空中索道，已经在动工修筑了。从峨眉山到大渡河口的轻便铁路，不久也将动工。
    峨眉山溪流瀑布很多，美丽的龙池湖相传是“龙王”吐出的水汇成的，实际上是峨眉山上的许多瀑布急流汇集成的湖沼。过去每到山洪暴发，燕儿河，六道河，观音河等就泛滥成灾，现在则利用它的水头多，流差大等特点，在峨眉山西翼修筑龙池多级水力发电站。不久前，这里还是一片荒凉，现在夜间闪耀着电灯，盖起了一排排新屋，满载机器材料的汽车来往奔驰不停，数以千计的工人、民工，正在赶修拦河坝，引水道和电厂坝基，争取1956年11月开始发电。工程全部完工后可以发电二万五千瓩左右。它将和岷江电厂构成一个输电网，供给峨眉、乐山等地许多厂矿用电和居民照明的需要。那时周围一千多里的峨眉山区，将会变得更加美丽繁荣！
