Workers Demand Collective Improvement

    Some workers at the Taiyuan Chemical Metallurgical First Engineering Company said, "Advanced groups are just being forcibly supported by the leadership. Anyway, whoever the leadership wants to be advanced, they are advanced. If the leadership says you are backward, you can work yourself to death and still not get rid of the backward label." Workers at the Fourth Engineering Office of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau also have similar opinions.

    Why are the workers saying these things? This is because the leaders of these two units, after cultivating advanced groups, did not use the experience of the advanced groups to help the backward groups improve production. They did not conduct in-depth investigations and specific analyses of individuals or groups who failed to complete their plans and provide specific assistance, but instead simply labeled them as "backward." As a result, there are significant disparities in the completion of quotas among the groups. The best group in the Fourth Engineering Office of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau reached more than 300% of the quota, but nearly half of the groups still did not reach the quota. In the excavation project of the preparation workshop of the First Engineering Office, the best group reached 200% of the quota, while the lowest only reached 43%.

    The workers' opinions are a call for collective improvement. The leading comrades of these units should listen to these calls and change their erroneous views toward "advanced" and "backward."

    工人们要求共同提高
    太原市化学冶金第一工程公司有些工人说：“先进小组还不是领导上硬扶起来的，反正领导叫谁先进谁就先进，领导说你落后，你就努力死也难摘掉落后帽子。”太原工程局第四工程处的工人们，也有类似的意见。
    工人们为什么说这样的话呢？这是因为这两个单位的领导人，把先进小组培养起来以后，没用先进小组的经验去帮助落后小组改进生产。对完成计划不好的人或小组，没有深入调查和具体分析，给以具体的帮助，而是一律给他们戴上“落后”的帽子。因此，各组在完成定额上悬殊很大。太原工程局第四工程处最好的小组达到定额的300％以上，但是还差不多有一半小组没达到定额。第一工程处准备工段挖土工程，最好的小组达到定额的200％，而最低的只达到43％。
    工人们的意见，是一种要求共同提高的呼声。这些单位的领导同志应该倾听这些呼声，改变对待“先进”和“落后”的错误看法。
