Not Even a Single Fraction of a Field Should Be Left Uncultivated

During the spring plowing season, the Nanjiang District of Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, discovered that 185 mu of paddy fields were not being cultivated. These fields were all small and scattered throughout the district. Some were reserve fields left over from the land reform, and the farmers who were responsible for cultivating them in the past had joined cooperatives, so now no one was cultivating them. Others were interplanted fields between cooperatives, and everyone disliked the inconvenience of cultivating them, so they simply ignored them. Still others were fields belonging to a small number of wealthy peasants and landlords outside the cooperatives, who either couldn't hire workers, couldn't manage them, or abandoned them because of concerns. There were also a few fields belonging to widowed or orphaned households who had not yet joined the cooperatives.

The township staff did not pay attention to these fields because they considered them to be small in number. The agricultural production cooperatives were unwilling to cultivate the small and scattered fields, fearing that they would not meet the planned output. After discovering this problem, the Nanjiang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately discussed solutions with the township branches, and decided that the nearby cooperatives should be responsible for cultivating these reserve fields; the interplanted fields between cooperatives should be exchanged between the cooperatives; the farmers who quit farming should be persuaded to actively cultivate the fields; and the fields of the widowed, orphaned, and elderly households who had not yet joined the cooperatives should be cultivated by the cooperatives on their behalf, or they should be absorbed into the cooperatives. After such separate handling, the phenomenon of abandoned land was eliminated.

Such situations have been found in many other regions. All localities should attach importance to this issue and actively organize agricultural cooperatives or farmers to cultivate unattended fields.

    一分田也不能荒废
    湖南省平江县南江区在春耕期间，发现有185亩水田无人耕种。这些田都是零星小块，分布在全区各地。有的是土地改革的时候留下的机动田，过去负责耕种的农民入了社，现在没人耕种了；有的是社和社之间的插花田，大家嫌耕作不方便，索性不管了；有的是社外少数富裕农民和富农的田，他们因为雇不到工，经营不过来，或者因为有顾虑，就抛弃了；还有少数是尚未入社的孤寡户的田。
    乡的工作人员认为这些田数量不多，不加重视。各个农业生产合作社不愿种零星小块的田，怕达不到计划产量。中共南江区委会发现这一问题后，立即和各乡支部研究了处理办法，确定将这些机动田由附近的合作社包干耕种；社和社之间的插花田，组织各社兑换；单干农民抛弃的田，尽力说服田主积极耕种；还没入社的孤寡老弱户的田，由社代耕，或吸收入社。经过这样分别处理，抛荒现象消灭了。
    这样的情况，在别的地区也发现不少。各地应该重视这个问题，积极组织农业合作社或农民耕种无人照顾的田。
