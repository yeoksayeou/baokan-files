Dear friends! Experience shows that once you have visited a good friend's country as a guest, it is easy to find your way next time. Therefore, we are very happy to accept the invitation to come to Beijing. I advise all friends to take advantage of our experience and visit us often. This refers to those who already know the way to our place. As for those who don't know the way, find it the first time, and then you can go often.

Not long ago, I visited Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Burma, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It must be said that it was my first time in this region, although I had some understanding of it in the past. There, I talked with government officials of those countries and met many people. Today's Asia is not the Asia of the past.

All these countries have suffered colonial oppression in the past, and now they have been liberated and are consolidating their national independence. These countries are each taking their own path to bring happiness to their people, develop their economy, prosper their culture, and utilize their resources.

These countries have something in common, which is the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence – Panchsheel – put forward by the leaders of the two major Asian countries, Comrade Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru. The spirit of these principles, adopted at the Bandung Conference, now dominates in all these countries, which is the spirit of peace and friendship among the people of all countries. The people of these Asian countries, who have only recently gained freedom, yearn for peace and hope to build and develop their countries with their own strength in a peaceful environment. In our talks and meetings, we always found it easy to find a common language, because our countries have consistently strived for world peace. All our steps in foreign policy are aimed at this goal. Not only has the face of these Asian countries, now living in a new way, changed, but they have also had a favorable impact on the liberation of those who are still oppressed. These independent Asian countries have had a beneficial impact on the entire international politics for peace. The world has heard the voice of a new Asia.

We were warmly welcomed by the governments and people of all these countries, for which we are deeply grateful. We are very happy that our talks and exchanges have helped to better mutual understanding and to the cause of peace, which is beneficial not only to the people of our countries but also to the people of all countries.

Since we already have a good understanding of each other, our visit to Beijing will certainly be more helpful for mutual understanding. We will be very happy to know how the Chinese people are bravely and rapidly advancing along the new road, how they are developing their economy and culture, how bravely they are carrying out socialist transformation to achieve a happy life.

I can express on behalf of all Soviet people that they feel heartfelt joy for the achievements of the Chinese people, just as they do for their own achievements.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China!

    米高扬第一副主席的讲话
    亲爱的朋友！经验说明，只要在好朋友的国家里作过一次客，下次就很容易摸到路了。所以我们十分高兴地接受邀请来到了北京。我劝告所有的朋友们利用我们的这个经验，也常到我们那里去。这是指那些已经知道去我们那里的路的人，至于不知道路的人，第一次摸一下，以后就可以常常去了。
    不久以前，我访问了阿富汗、巴基斯坦、印度、缅甸和越南民主共和国。应该说，我是第一次到这个地区，虽然过去对这个地区也有所了解。在那里，我同那些国家的政府人士交谈过，会见了许多人。现在的亚洲已经不是过去的亚洲了。
    所有这些国家过去都经受过殖民压迫，现在已经解放了，并且正在巩固自己的民族独立。这些国家各自通过自己的道路使本国人民得到幸福、发展经济、繁荣文化和利用富源。
    这些国家有着共同的地方，这就是亚洲两个大国的领导人周恩来同志和尼赫鲁总理提出的著名的和平共处五项原则——潘查希拉。万隆会议通过的这些原则的精神，现在在所有这些国家中占统治地位，这就是和平和各国人民友好的精神。这些亚洲国家的人民不久前才获得自由，它们渴望和平，希望在和平环境中用自己的力量建设并且发展自己的国家。在谈话和会见中，我们总是很容易就找到了共同的语言，因为我们这些国家是一贯争取世界和平的。我们在外交政策方面的一切步骤都抱着这一目的。不但这些现在按新方式生活的亚洲国家的面貌已经改变了，它们对那些还受着压迫的人民的解放产生了有利的影响。这些独立的亚洲国家对整个国际政治起了有利于和平的影响。全世界已听到了新的亚洲的声音。
    我们在所有这些国家里都受到这些国家的政府和人民的热诚欢迎，为此我们深深感谢。我们很高兴，我们的谈话和来往有助于更好的互相谅解，有助于和平事业，这不只对我们这些国家的人民有利，而且对一切国家的人民都有利。
    既然我们现在就已经相互有了很好的了解，我们这次访问北京当然将更有助于互相了解。我们将很高兴地知道中国人民如何勇敢地和迅速地沿着新的道路前进，如何发展自己的经济、文化，如何勇敢地进行社会主义改造，以取得幸福的生活。
    我可以代表全体苏联人表示，他们为中国人民的成就感到衷心的喜悦，就像他们对自己的成就一样。
    苏中两国牢不可破的友谊万岁！
