Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 4th. At the mass rally held in Ba Dinh Square, Hanoi on the afternoon of April 3rd to welcome the Soviet government delegation, Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Comrade Mikoyan, head of the Soviet government delegation, delivered speeches. The full text of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's speech is as follows:

Comrade Head of the Soviet Government Delegation,
Comrades Members of the Delegation,
Dear Compatriots:

Today, the residents of the capital and the people of our country are joyously welcoming the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Mikoyan. We warmly welcome the delegation, Comrade Head of the Delegation, and Comrades Members of the Delegation. The Soviet delegation has brought the warm friendship of the Soviet people to our people and the residents of our capital. The visit of the Soviet delegation to our country will surely play an important role in promoting the genuine friendship between the people of our two countries.

The Vietnamese and Soviet people are brothers in the great family of socialism and people's democracy. For many years, the people of our two countries have been united and struggling together under the banner of Marxism-Leninism for the cause of national independence, democratic freedom, and the construction of socialism and the defense of world peace.

The victorious Russian October Revolution awakened the oppressed people and opened the road to liberation for the people of colonies and dependent countries – including our Vietnam.

The Soviet Communist Party established by Lenin has led the Soviet people to socialism and is leading them towards communism, while showing the people of all countries the path of uniting and struggling to liberate themselves.

After nearly forty years, the Soviet Union has successfully built socialism and is steadily advancing towards communism. The Soviet Union has become one of the most powerful countries and a staunch fortress of world peace.

The Vietnamese people will never forget the Soviet Union's contribution in defeating fascism in Europe and Asia, making a decisive contribution to the cause of liberating mankind from slavery, and helping our August Revolution of 1945 to achieve victory.

Throughout our long and arduous war of resistance, our people received the deep admiration of the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the peace-loving people of all countries. The Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China were the first to recognize us, thereby encouraging our people to fight until complete victory.

At the Geneva Conference in 1954, the Soviet and Chinese delegations once again fully supported our diplomatic struggle and helped us win a great victory, which was the restoration of peace to our beloved motherland on the basis of other countries recognizing our independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity.

The more grateful our people are to the Soviet Union, the more joyful our people in the capital Hanoi are in welcoming the dear representatives of the great Soviet Union.

I take this opportunity to remind our compatriots in the capital and our compatriots throughout the country of our current tasks:

The North of Vietnam has been liberated, but our country has not yet been unified. Therefore, although the North of Vietnam has been completely liberated today thanks to the victory of many years of resistance war and the victory of the Geneva Conference, our compatriots must still strive to consolidate peace, strengthen the North of Vietnam, and at the same time struggle for the reunification of the country on the basis of independence and democracy.

Since the restoration of peace, the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries have been working hard to help our government and our people heal our war wounds and rebuild our country. They are helping us unconditionally and have also sent experts to give us technical assistance.

In order to express our gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people, and to further enhance the fraternal solidarity between our two countries, a delegation of our government and the Labor Party visited the Soviet Union last year. The delegation received a very friendly and grand welcome and reception in the Soviet Union. We should wholeheartedly thank the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Soviet Communist Party.

The Soviet Union has given our country tremendous assistance. The Soviet Union has made tremendous contributions to the cause of world peace. The 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party summarized the rich experience of the Soviet people's struggles over these many years and formulated the Sixth Five-Year Plan, which aims to make the Soviet Union more prosperous and powerful. The Congress is a source of inspiration for the people of all countries in the world, and it further illuminates the path for the Soviet people to victory. At the same time, it helps the people of our country and the people of all countries in the world to determine their own path of struggle for independence, democracy, and peace through peaceful means.

In a very short period of time since the restoration of peace, the North of our country has become stronger. Our compatriots who have made efforts must continue to make greater efforts.

This means that we must victoriously complete land reform so that peasants throughout the North of Vietnam have land.

We must complete the national plan, restore the economy, and begin to develop culture. I congratulate our compatriots in the countryside, cities, construction sites, factories, and schools for the good achievements they have made in implementing this year's plan.

At the same time, we must continue to strengthen national defense, suppress saboteurs, and maintain safety and order for the people.

Through the above work, we will gradually improve the living conditions of people from all walks of life so that the people of our country can have sufficient food and clothing, have healthy bodies, and have opportunities to learn culture.

Agricultural taxes have been partially reduced this year. Salaries have been increased, but this is only the first step. We must work together to make the lives of our people better and happier. This is the policy of our Party and government.

Consolidating the North of Vietnam can lay a solid foundation for the struggle to achieve national reunification.

As long as our country is not unified, all our compatriots must resolutely struggle to unify our country and build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam.

We have always strictly fulfilled the Geneva Accords and demanded that the other party also correctly fulfill these agreements. We must struggle on the basis of the Geneva Accords in order to reunify our country through peaceful means.

The French government, which signed these agreements, should not shirk its responsibilities. We demand that France should correctly fulfill the provisions of the agreements.

From a legal point of view, the South Vietnamese government has an obligation to fulfill the Geneva Accords. The reunification of Vietnam must be achieved as a result of free general elections held through consultations between the North and South of Vietnam. If anyone is unwilling to conduct such consultations and does not respect the will of the people, he violates the wishes and interests of the people and will therefore be opposed by the people.

The implementation of the Geneva Accords is currently encountering difficulties. However, our people do not evade these difficulties. We must believe that the strength of the people who unite and struggle is a force that will surely win, an invincible force. All our people from the South to the North must unite widely and closely and struggle according to the political program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. Our struggle must be a persistent and unyielding struggle, but it will surely be victorious.

Internationally, we must be closely united with the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries.

We guarantee to strengthen our peaceful and friendly relations with other countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We are willing to maintain good relations with our two neighboring countries, Cambodia and Laos. We will further strengthen our friendly relations with other countries in Southeast Asia, particularly with India, Burma, and Indonesia.

Comrades, the Soviet Union went through many difficulties and hardships before achieving today's great achievements. Because the Soviet people resolutely united and struggled, and because the Soviet Communist Party and government adopted correct policies, the Soviet people overcame all difficulties and achieved great victories.

Today, the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence has achieved great victory in the North of Vietnam. There are difficulties on the road to restoring national unity. However, the difficulties we face today are smaller than the difficulties the Soviet Union faced in the past. Therefore, if we unite and wage a resolute struggle, victory will surely belong to us.

Once again, on behalf of the people of the capital and our compatriots throughout the country, I warmly welcome the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Mikoyan and request the delegation to convey our friendly congratulations and warm gratitude to the Soviet government and people.

Long live the consolidated friendship between Vietnam and the Soviet Union!

Long live a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam!

Long live the great Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    在河内举行的欢迎苏联政府代表团的群众大会上
    胡志明主席的讲话
    据新华社河内4日电　四月三日下午在河内巴亭广场举行的欢迎苏联政府代表团的群众大会上越南民主共和国主席胡志明和苏联政府代表团团长米高扬先后讲了话。胡志明主席的讲话全文如下：苏联政府代表团团长同志：代表团团员同志：亲爱的同胞们：
    今天首都居民和我国全国人民都在兴高采烈地欢迎以米高扬同志为首的苏联政府代表团。我们热情地欢迎代表团、代表团团长同志和代表团团员同志。苏联代表团给我国人民和我国首都居民带来了苏联人民的热情的友谊。苏联代表团对我国的访问一定会对促进我们两国人民之间的真正友谊起重要作用。
    越南人民和苏联人民是社会主义和人民民主大家庭中的兄弟。许多年以来，我们两国人民一直在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，为了争取民族独立、民主自由的事业和建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的事业而共同团结一致和进行斗争。
    胜利的俄国十月革命唤醒了被压迫人民，为殖民地和附属国人民——我们越南也包括在内——打开了解放的道路。
    由列宁建立的苏联共产党已经领导苏联人民到达了社会主义，而且正在领导着苏联人民走向共产主义，同时正在向世界各国人民显示团结起来进行斗争以解放他们自己的道路。
    在经过了将近四十年后，苏联今天已成功地建设了社会主义，而且正在稳步地向共产主义前进。苏联已经成为最强大国家之一，世界和平的坚强堡垒。
    越南人民将永不忘记苏联的贡献，它打败了欧洲和亚洲的法西斯主义，对于把人类从奴役下解放出来的事业作了决定性的贡献，帮助使我们1945年8月的革命获得胜利。
    在我们长期的艰苦抗战的整个期间，我国人民得到了苏联人民、中国人民和全世界爱好和平的各国人民的深切赞许。苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府最先承认我们，从而鼓励了我国人民要进行斗争直到完全胜利。
    1954年在日内瓦会议上，苏联和中国的代表团再度全力支持我国的外交斗争，并且帮助我们赢得了一项巨大的胜利，这就是在其他国家承认我们的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上恢复了我们可爱的祖国的和平。
    我国人民对苏联愈感激，我国人民在首都河内欢迎伟大苏联的亲爱的代表们就愈加兴高采烈。
    我趁这个机会向我们首都的同胞和全国同胞回顾一下我们目前的任务：
    越南北方已经解放，但是我们国家还没有统一。因此，虽然由于多年抗战的胜利和日内瓦会议的胜利今天越南北方已经完全解放了，但是我国同胞还必须努力巩固和平，加强越南北方，同时为在独立和民主的基础上实现国家的重新统一而斗争。
    自从和平恢复以来，苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家一直在努力帮助我国政府和我国人民医治我们的战争创伤，重建我们的国家。它们是在无条件地帮助我们，而且还派了专家来给我们技术援助。
    为了表示我们对苏联政府和苏联人民的感激，为了进一步增进我们两国之间的兄弟般的团结，我国政府和劳动党的代表团在去年访问了苏联。代表团在苏联受到了非常友好和隆重的欢迎和接待。我们应该衷心地感谢苏联人民、苏联政府和苏联共产党。
    苏联给予了我国巨大的帮助。苏联对世界和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会总结了苏联人民在这许多年中的丰富的斗争经验，制订了目的在于使苏联更加繁荣强大的第六个五年计划。代表大会是全世界各国人民得到鼓舞的源泉，它进一步照亮了苏联人民走向胜利的道路。同时，它有助于我国人民和全世界各国人民决定他们自己的通过和平方式争取独立、民主和和平的斗争的道路。
    在恢复和平以后的很短期间内，我国的北方已经变得更加强大了。已经作了努力的我国同胞必须继续作出更大的努力。
    这意味着，我们必须胜利地完成土地改革，使越南北方各地的农民都有土地。
    我们必须完成国家计划，恢复经济和开始发展文化。我向在农村、城市、建筑工地、工厂和学校等处的我国同胞祝贺，祝贺他们在执行今年的计划中取得了很好的成就。
    同时，我们必须继续加强国防，镇压破坏分子，为人民保持安全和秩序。
    通过上述的工作，我们将逐步改善各界人民的生活条件，使我国人民能够得到足够的衣食、有健康的身体和学习文化的机会。
    今年的农业税已经有部分的减轻。薪金已经提高了，但是这还只是第一步。我们必须一起努力使我国人民的生活越来越美好和幸福。这是我们党和政府的政策。
    巩固越南北方就可以为争取全国重新统一的斗争奠定一个坚实的基础。
    只要我们的国家还没有统一，我国全体同胞必须坚决进行斗争，以统一我们的国家，建立一个和平、统一、独立、民主、繁荣和强大的越南。
    我们一向严格履行日内瓦协议，并且要求对方也正确履行这些协议。我们必须在日内瓦协议的基础上进行斗争，以便通过和平的方法重新统一我们的国家。
    在这些协议上签字的法国政府不应该逃避它的责任。我们要求法国应该正确履行协议中的条款。
    从法律观点来看，南越政府有义务履行日内瓦协定。越南的统一必须作为通过越南北方和南方之间的协商从而举行自由普选的结果来取得。如果有谁不愿意进行这种协商，不尊重人民的这种意志，他就违反人民的愿望和利益，因而就会遭到人民的反对。
    日内瓦协定的执行目前正遭遇到困难。但是，我们的人民并不逃避这些困难。我们必须相信，团结起来进行斗争的人民的力量是一种一定会取得胜利的力量，是一种不可战胜的力量。我们从南方到北方的全体人民必须广泛地和紧密地团结起来，根据越南祖国战线的政治纲领进行斗争。我们的斗争一定是一种持久的和不屈不挠的斗争，但它将一定会取得胜利。
    在国际上，我们必须紧密地和苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家团结在一起。
    我们保证按照和平共处的五项原则加强我们和其他国家的和平和友好关系。我们愿意和我们的两个邻邦柬埔寨和老挝保持良好关系。我们将进一步加强我们和东南亚其他国家的友好关系，特别是和印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚的友好关系。
    同胞们，苏联曾经经历许许多多困难和艰苦，才取得了今天伟大的成就。由于苏联人民坚决地团结一致和进行斗争，由于苏联共产党和政府采取了正确的政策，苏联人民渡过了一切难关而获得了伟大的胜利。
    今天越南人民争取独立的斗争已经在越南北方取得巨大的胜利。在恢复全国统一的道路上是有困难的。但是，我们今天面临的困难要比苏联过去面临的困难小。因此，如果我们团结一致进行坚决的斗争，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    我再一次代表首都人民和我们全国同胞热烈欢迎以米高扬同志为首的苏联政府代表团，并且请求代表团向苏联政府和人民转达我们的友好的祝贺和热烈的感谢。
    越南和苏联的巩固友谊万岁！
    和平、统一、独立、民主、繁荣和强大的越南万岁！
    伟大的苏联万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
