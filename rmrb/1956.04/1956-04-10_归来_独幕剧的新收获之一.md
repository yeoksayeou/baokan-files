    "Homecoming" - One of the New Gains in One-Act Plays
    Jiang Dong
    Playwright: Lu Yanzhou; Director: Li Peiren; Performed by the Anhui Provincial Drama Troupe
      "Homecoming" reveals significant social issues concerning love, family, and morality through a sharp family conflict. The author ruthlessly lashes out at the morally corrupt, bourgeois ideology of those who trifle with women, and enthusiastically praises the new views on love characterized by mutual aid, shared labor, and unwavering loyalty.
    The author and performers in "Homecoming" vividly portray two opposing figures – the hardworking, kind, steadfast, and courageous Tong Huiyun and the degenerate, corrupt, and ungrateful Wang Biao. They are a couple, but represent two completely different moral and philosophical outlooks on life. The struggle between Tong Huiyun and Wang Biao is precisely a battle between the thoughts of the working class and the laboring people and the thoughts of the bourgeoisie and exploiters. Although Wang Biao is a Communist Party member, he has already deteriorated and degenerated. If he does not turn back soon, he is clearly unworthy of this glorious title. The author quite fully exposes Wang Biao's ugly thoughts and praises Tong Huiyun's spiritual qualities. This play has very good educational significance.
    The author has made detailed and deeply insightful portrayals of the inner worlds of the male and female protagonists. Before Tong Huiyun even appears, the author sets the stage by highlighting the joyful and happy atmosphere that Tong Huiyun brings to Wang Biao's family. Once Tong Huiyun appears, the author further writes that she is not only an outstanding worker, but also a young person loved by the masses. When the news of Wang Biao's return arrives, the author meticulously depicts Tong Huiyun's joy in her heart and her shyness in expressing it. Therefore, when the daughter leans in Tong Huiyun's arms, and the mother and daughter are immersed in happy thoughts, the female protagonist's gentle, kind, and simple, lovely image has already left a strong impression in the audience's hearts. After Wang Biao returns, he shamelessly boasts that "it's really not easy to be a leading cadre"; after the neighbors leave, he begins a clever attack on Tong Huiyun, attempting to achieve his despicable goal of divorcing his wife, who is "too far apart" from him, and marrying a younger woman.
    This conflict is achieved through further revelation of the characters' inner worlds. The author describes Wang Biao's despicable means of beating around the bush, threatening, and enticing his wife, as well as Tong Huiyun's sincere love for her husband. As Wang Biao pushes further and further, she begins to wake up and finally resolutely separates from Wang Biao. This conflict is very moving, and the spiritual faces of the two characters are revealed layer by layer to the audience like peeling bamboo shoots. The audience clearly sees the two protagonists going in opposite directions, and as Wang Biao advances step by step and Tong Huiyun goes from joy to shocked pain, the audience shares the worries and sorrows of the hardworking and kind female protagonist.
    The author vividly depicts Tong Huiyun's awakening from pain and becoming stronger. She represents a new type of working woman with an independent personality, and a strong socialist force emanates from Tong Huiyun.
    The author also describes the whole society's cultivation and support for Tong Huiyun. People sternly condemn the morally corrupt and despise the ungrateful Wang Biao, and feel injustice for Tong Huiyun. The author tells the audience in the end: Tong Huiyun painfully ended her unhappy married life, but happily gained the love, support, and endorsement of the broad masses. The victor is not Wang Biao but Tong Huiyun, the entire new society.
      "Homecoming" is one of the popular plays in this National Drama Performance and Observation Meeting and is a valuable new gain in one-act play creation in recent years. However, I think there are still some shortcomings in the characterization. Although the author successfully portrays Tong Huiyun's noble qualities, the revelation of Wang Biao's ugly soul is not rich, vivid, and profound enough. The author wrote about Wang Biao using various despicable means to achieve his goal of divorcing his wife. This aspect of the description is specific, but what about the emotional changes of a person who has been away from home for four years when he faces his mother, wife, and children? Especially as a "Communist Party member" and a state cadre, he should know that his behavior will be subject to criticism from party discipline, national laws, and social opinion, but he actually did it. If the author meticulously depicts the spiritual world of this morally corrupt person, and writes about his different emotions with his family and the complex inner activities when facing Tong Huiyun, then this character image will be more vivid, and the audience will see more deeply Wang Biao's ugly and insignificant soul.

    “归来”——独幕剧的新收获之一
    江东
    作剧：鲁彦周　导演：李培仁　安徽省话剧团演出
      “归来”通过一场尖锐的家庭冲突揭示了具有重大社会意义的爱情、家庭、道德问题，作者无情地鞭挞了道德败坏、玩弄妇女的资产阶级思想，热情地歌颂了互助互爱、共同劳动、忠诚不渝的新的爱情观点。
    作者和演出者在“归来”中鲜明地塑造了两个对立的形象——勤劳善良、坚贞勇敢的童蕙云和堕落腐化、忘情负义的王彪。这是一对夫妇，却代表着两种截然不同的道德观、人生观。童蕙云和王彪的斗争，正是工人阶级、劳动人民的思想同资产阶级、剥削者的思想的一场搏斗。虽则王彪是个共产党员，但是他已经蜕化变质。如果不趁早回头的话，他显然不配拥有这个光荣的称号了。作者相当充分地暴露了王彪的丑恶思想，歌颂了童蕙云的精神品质。这个剧是有很好的教育意义的。
    作者对男女主人公作了细致的、深入内心世界的勾画。作者在童蕙云还未出场时，就烘托出童蕙云给王彪家庭所带来的欢快幸福的气氛，等到童蕙云一出场，作者进一步地写出她不仅是一个出色的劳动者，而且是一个受到群众爱戴的年轻人，当王彪归来的讯息传来后，作者细致地刻划了童蕙云喜在心里、羞于外露的心情，所以当女儿依在童蕙云怀里，母女两人浸沉在幸福的思念中时，女主人公温柔善良的性格和淳朴可爱的形象已经在观众的心里留下了强烈的印象。王彪归来后，他恬不知耻地吹嘘“当了领导干部可真不容易”；等到邻人们离去后，他开始向童蕙云展开了巧妙的进攻，企图达到和他“相差太远”的妻子离婚、去和更年轻的女人结婚的卑鄙目的。
    这场冲突是通过对人物内心世界进一步地揭示来实现的，作者描写了王彪对妻子拐弯抹角、威胁利诱的卑劣手段，也描写了童蕙云对丈夫的诚挚爱恋。在王彪一步进一步的逼迫下，她开始惊醒过来，最后终于坚强地和王彪分开。这场冲突，十分动人心弦，两个人物的精神面貌像剥笋皮似地一层层在观众面前展现。观众清晰地看到两个主人公向相反的道路上走去，随着王彪步步进逼和童蕙云的从喜悦进入到震惊的苦痛中，观众是同勤劳善良的女主人公同忧共戚的。
    作者最后生动地描写了童蕙云从痛苦中觉醒起来，坚强起来。她代表了有独立人格的新型的劳动妇女，从童蕙云身上散发出一股强烈的社会主义力量。
    作者还描写了整个社会对童蕙云的培养和支持，人们严正地指责道德败坏者，唾弃忘情负义的王彪，为童蕙云不平。作者在最后告诉观众：童蕙云痛苦地结束了她不幸福的夫妇生活，却幸福地得到了广大群众的热爱、拥戴和支持，胜利者不是王彪而是童蕙云，是整个新社会。
      “归来”是这次全国话剧观摩演出会中受欢迎的剧目之一，是近年来独幕剧创作中可贵的新收获。但是，我认为在人物刻划上，也还有一些缺点。作者虽然成功地刻划了童蕙云的高尚品质，但是对王彪的丑恶灵魂的揭示还不够丰富、鲜明和深刻。作者写了王彪采用各种卑鄙手段来达到和妻子离婚的目的，这方面的描写是具体的，但是一个离家四年的人回来后，他面对着母亲妻儿的感情变化呢？特别作为一个“共产党员”和国家干部，他应该知道自己的行为是会得到党纪国法和社会舆论的指责的，可是他居然这样做了。如果作者细致地刻划出这个道德败坏者的精神世界，写出他同家人不同的感情和面对童蕙云时的错综复杂的内心活动，那么这个人物形象将会更生动，也就使观众更深刻地看到王彪丑恶而又渺小的灵魂。
