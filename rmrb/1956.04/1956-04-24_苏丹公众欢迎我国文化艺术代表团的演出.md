Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, 23rd: The performance by the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, has caused a sensation throughout the city. Every program performed by the Chinese artists has become a topic of conversation, and these programs have been universally welcomed and highly praised.

The performance began at 9:30 in the evening, but the audience began to enter the venue as early as 7:00 in the afternoon. Some audience members traveled from five or six hundred miles away. After the performance, many people went backstage to pay their respects to the Chinese artists and asked for their autographs. As the artists left the performance venue, the audience lined the entrance to bid them farewell.

People from all walks of life in Khartoum also requested the delegation to extend the performance time. To meet their demands, the delegation has agreed to perform an additional show.

Khartoum newspapers have published lengthy articles commenting on the performance in prominent positions. "The Nile Gazette" published a review of the delegation's first performance on April 19th, titled "A Night of a Lifetime." The newspaper said that although we do not understand Chinese, we can still appreciate Chinese art. "Al-Haqiqa" (The Truth) reported on April 20th that although the theater used was an open-air theater and the language used was a foreign language, we still experienced a rare evening. The Chinese artists are masters of their respective fields. Every program won applause. "Al-Rai al-Aam" (Public Opinion) published an article on April 20th discussing the transformation of art based on the performance of the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation. The newspaper quoted Chairman Mao's words "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," and also published a photo of Chairman Mao.

    苏丹公众欢迎我国文化艺术代表团的演出
    新华社喀土穆23日电  中国文化艺术代表团在苏丹首都喀土穆的演出轰动了全市。中国艺术家们表演的每一个节目都成为人们谈论的话题，这些节目受到了普遍的欢迎和很高的评价。
    演出在晚上九点半开始，但是观众在下午七点就已经开始入场了。有些观众是从五、六百英里以外赶来的。许多人在演出完毕以后到后台向中国艺术家们表示敬意并且要求他们签名。在艺术家们离开演出地点时，观众们在门口夹道欢送。
    喀土穆各界人士还要求代表团延长演出的时间。为了满足他们的要求，代表团已经同意多演一场。
    喀土穆报纸都在显著地位刊载了评论演出的长篇文章。“尼罗日报”四月十九日以“我们一生中的一个夜晚”为题，评论代表团的首次演出。这家报纸说，虽然我们不懂中国话，但是仍然能够欣赏中国艺术。“实话报”四月二十日说，虽然使用的剧场是露天剧场，使用的语言是陌生的语言，但是我们仍然经历了一个难得的夜晚。中国的艺术家们都是他们本行的大师。每一个节目都赢得了掌声。“舆论报”四月二十日发表一篇从中国文化艺术代表团的演出看改造艺术的文章。这家报纸援引了毛主席的话“百花齐放，推陈出新”，并且还刊登了毛主席的照片。
