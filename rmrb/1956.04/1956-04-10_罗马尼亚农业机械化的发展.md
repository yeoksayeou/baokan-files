    The Development of Agricultural Mechanization in Romania
    Tailtelu Moldovanu, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the Romanian People's Republic

    Increasing our agricultural production in the shortest possible time by increasing yields per unit area is an important goal of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Government of the Romanian People's Republic. The mechanization of agricultural production is a decisive link in achieving this goal. Tractors and agricultural machinery replace and save human labor, and can complete agricultural operations in the short term under the most superior conditions. They are the main force to ensure the rapid upsurge of agricultural production in Romania in the next two or three years.

    In the past, 76% of Romania's population was engaged in agriculture, using extremely rudimentary tools in the countryside. In bourgeois-landlord Romania, the level of mechanization of agricultural operations was very low even on the large farms of landlords and rich peasants.

    After liberation, with the full assistance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the Romanian working class has built a strong socialist industry and produced its own tractors and agricultural machinery. This has made it possible for the state to equip Romanian agriculture with new machinery and equipment.

    The machine manufacturing industry, as the center of heavy industry in the Romanian People's Republic, is expanding the production of tractors and agricultural machinery year by year, and supplying agriculture with new types of machines and equipment. The Romanian People's Republic is now able to mass-produce mechanically drawn plows, cultivators, heavy cultivators, reapers, threshers, grain and beet sowing machines, insecticides, fixed engines and pumps for irrigation, and direct-dial telephones, and so on.

    Machine tractor stations and state farms play a decisive role in promoting new agricultural technologies and maximizing the productive efficiency of the machines supplied by industry. Machine tractor stations and state farms are the property of the whole people. They concentrate basic agricultural means of production in the hands of the state, thus guaranteeing the rational use of machines and the great possibility of continuously improving equipment to meet the needs of modern technological development.

    At present, machine tractor stations and state farms own nearly 30,000 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per unit), more than 1,500 automatic combine harvesters and many other complex agricultural machines.

    Machine tractor stations are a powerful lever for organizing socialist agriculture and increasing agricultural production. There are now 222 machine tractor stations in Romania. Their workload in 1955 was three and a half times higher than in 1949. If the initial business of machine tractor stations was mainly plowing, then now the work carried out by sowing machines, heavy cultivators, harvesters, reapers, combine harvesters, etc., has gradually occupied a more significant position in the total workload of machine tractor stations.

    In the summer of 1955, the total amount of work completed by machine tractor stations using machines for cultivation was 5.8 times higher than in 1953. The mechanization of cultivation alone saved the collective farms in Romania about 800,000 workdays in 1955.

    As the advanced stronghold of the working class in the countryside, machine tractor stations should become the true organizers of the production of the three existing types of agricultural production cooperatives in Romania—collective farms, joint farming societies and simple production mutual aid groups. Machine tractor stations help collective farms and joint farming societies to complete agricultural operations in a timely manner according to contracts, rationally organize production, adopt advanced production methods in agriculture, and achieve high yields.

    According to the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party in August 1953, machine tractor stations also strengthened their assistance to individual farmers.

    In 1955, the Romanian People's Republic adopted a new system of paying for the work completed by machine tractor stations with physical objects. This new system gave the various farms new superior conditions, making it easier for the working peasants to use the machines of machine tractor stations. The main feature of the new fixed rate for paying machine tractor stations with physical objects is that the remuneration does not increase with the increase in yield per hectare, but remains fixed. It is only differentiated according to regions with different natural fertility. Therefore, all the output increased due to the adoption of agrotechnical regulations is entirely handled by the farm served by the machine tractor station itself.

    The extensive mechanization of agricultural operations is the basic condition for increasing agricultural production and strengthening the role of state farms. The state strives to organize state farms in such a way that they can become centers for adopting new technologies in agriculture and powerful examples of the superiority of collective labor with machines on large tracts of land. In addition, the state also equips these socialist enterprises with the most advanced technical tools. At present, the working capacity of tractors and machines in state farms can enable the mechanization of agricultural operations to reach a high level.

    The state farms of the Romanian People's Republic have been able to transition from the partial mechanization of basic agricultural operations to the complete mechanization of the entire set of cultivation, and even the operations of those crops that require a lot of various complex treatments have also been mechanized. Many state farms have also achieved mechanization in cultivating and harvesting industrial technical crops and vegetables. Due to the mechanization of the production process, advanced state farms have been able to solve the problem of labor shortages during the busy farming season and ensure high yields. For example, the Chirnogi State Farm in Bucharest has mechanized all operations such as sowing, cultivating and harvesting upland cotton. In 1954, this farm harvested an average of 1,817 kilograms of upland cotton per hectare on 150 hectares of land, breaking the record of the Romanian People's Republic.

    The agricultural machinery workers in our country have launched a strong movement to make the fullest possible use of equipment. The initiative of Vasili Voitkecha, the captain of the Sinicolaul-Mare Machine Tractor Station in Arad County and a hero of socialist labor, to cultivate 1,000 hectares of soft land with one tractor in one year has been responded to by many tractor drivers. In Romania, the number of combine harvester operators who ensure the harvesting of at least 20,000 kilograms of grain per day is increasing day by day.

    The mechanization of agricultural operations is the main way to increase yields and convince the working peasants of the benefits of the socialist road. Therefore, continuously expanding the mechanization of agricultural operations has become one of the most urgent tasks in Romanian agriculture in recent years. In order to achieve this goal, machine tractor stations and state farms must be equipped with new types of tractors and overhead transport equipment, so that field management and harvesting, the supply and preparation of feed, and the heavy operations in the livestock sector can be widely mechanized.

    In addition, one of the tasks facing the agricultural machinery operators in our country is to make fuller use of the machines so that they can exert greater productive efficiency and profitability. In this regard, improving the maintenance and repair of tractors and agricultural machinery is an important issue that needs to be resolved. In recent years, the network of specialized enterprises for mechanical centers and major repairs of tractors and combine harvesters will be expanded and consolidated. New mechanical repair shops will be built in the camps of machine tractor stations, state farms and tractor work teams.

    The development and improvement of agricultural mechanization largely depends on the work of supplying skilled technical cadres to socialist agricultural enterprises. In recent years, schools have trained many engineers, maintenance technicians, production team leaders, and tractor drivers who have mastered new technologies and can successfully apply agronomic achievements. Machine tractor stations and state farms are constantly receiving assistance in equipment and cadres from industrial enterprises. The assistance from technical cadres from industrial centers greatly promotes the continuous consolidation of the alliance between the working class and the working peasants.

    Now, the agricultural machinery workers in Romania are expanding the quantity and types of mechanized work, continuously improving the quality of mechanized work and reducing production costs. Their contribution to promoting the upsurge of agriculture and improving the material living standards of the working people is increasing day by day.

    罗马尼亚农业机械化的发展
    罗马尼亚人民共和国农林部副部长　泰特鲁·莫尔多瓦努
    在最短的期间内依靠提高单位面积产量来增加我国的农业生产，是罗马尼亚工人党和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府的一个重要目标。而农业生产的机械化则是实现这个目标的决定性的环节。拖拉机和农业机器代替并节省人们的劳动，能够在短期内在最优越的条件下完成农业的操作。它们是保证罗马尼亚的农业生产在最近两、三年内迅速高涨的主要力量。
    过去，罗马尼亚全国人口的76％都从事农业，在农村中使用的是极其简陋的工具。在资产阶级—地主的罗马尼亚，甚至在地主和富农的大农场中，农业操作的机械化水平也是非常低的。
    解放后，在苏联和人民民主国家的全面援助下，罗马尼亚工人阶级已经建立起了强大的社会主义工业，并出产了自己的拖拉机和农业机器。这就使得国家有可能用新的机器设备来装备罗马尼亚的农业。
    作为罗马尼亚人民共和国重工业的中心的机器制造业，正在逐年扩大拖拉机和农业机器的产量，并供应农业以新型的机器和装备。罗马尼亚人民共和国现在已能大批生产机械牵引犁、中耕机、粗耕机、割捆机、打谷机、谷物和甜菜播种机、杀虫器、灌溉用的固定发动机和抽水机，以及直达电话机等等。
    机器拖拉机站和国营农场在推行农业新技术和最大限度地利用工业所供给的机器的生产效率方面，起着决定性的作用。机器拖拉机站和国营农场是全民的财产。它们把基本农业生产资料集中在国家的手里，因而保证了合理使用机器和适应现代技术发展的需要来不断改进设备的巨大可能性。
    现在，机器拖拉机站和国营农场拥有将近三万台拖拉机（每台按十五匹马力计算），一千五百多台自动联合收割机和许多其他复杂的农业机器。
    机器拖拉机站是组织社会主义农业和提高农业生产的强大杠杆。现在罗马尼亚共有222个机器拖拉机站。它们的工作量1955年比1949年提高了三倍半。如果说机器拖拉机站在建立初期的业务主要是耕地，那末，现在播种机、粗耕机、收割机、割捆机、联合收割机等所进行的工作，在机器拖拉机站的工作总量中已逐渐占有更加显著的地位了。
    1955年夏天，机器拖拉机站用机器进行中耕所完成的工作总量，比1953年提高了五点八倍。仅只中耕这项工作的机械化，就使得罗马尼亚的集体农庄在1955年节省了约八十万个劳动日。
    作为工人阶级在农村中的先进据点的机器拖拉机站，应当成为罗马尼亚现有的三种类型的农业生产合作社——集体农庄、联合耕种社和简单的生产互助组——的生产的真正组织者。机器拖拉机站根据合同帮助集体农庄和联合耕种社及时地完成农业操作，合理地组织生产，在农业中采用先进的生产方法，并取得高度的收获量。
    根据1953年8月罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会全体会议的决议，机器拖拉机站也加强了对个体农民的帮助。
    1955年，罗马尼亚人民共和国采用了对机器拖拉机站所完成的工作以实物付给报酬的新制度，这种新制度给了各个农庄以新的优越条件，使劳动农民便于利用机器拖拉机站的机器。用实物支付机器拖拉机站工作报酬的新定率的主要特点是，报酬不因每公顷收获量的增长而提高，它是固定不变的。只是根据自然肥力不同的地区加以区别。所以，由于采用了农艺技术规程而提高的全部产量，完全归机器拖拉机站所服务的那个农庄自行处理。
    农业操作的广泛机械化是提高农业生产和加强国营农场的作用的基本条件。国家力求这样来组织国营农场，就是使它们能够成为在农业中采用新技术的中心和在大片土地上用机器进行集体劳动的优越性的有力榜样。此外，国家还用最完善的技术工具装备了这些社会主义企业。现在国营农场的拖拉机和机器的工作能力可使农业操作的机械化达到高度的水平。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的国营农场已经能够从基本农业操作的部分机械化过渡到整套耕作的全盘机械化，甚至对那些要作很多各种各样复杂处理的农作物的操作也已机械化了。许多国营农场在培育和收获工业技术作物和蔬菜方面也已达到机械化。由于生产过程的机械化，先进的国营农场已能解决农忙时期人手不够的问题，并能保证高度的收获量。例如，布加勒斯特州基尔诺得日国营农场已把旱地棉花的播种、中耕和收获等一切操作都机械化了。这个农场1954年在150公顷土地上平均每公顷收获了1，817公斤旱地棉花，打破了罗马尼亚人民共和国的纪录。
    我国的农业机器工人展开了为尽可能充分利用设备的强大运动。阿拉德州西尼考拉乌尔·马列机器拖拉机站工作队长、社会主义劳动英雄瓦西列·沃伊基查用一台拖拉机在一年内耕一千公顷软地的创举，获得了许多拖拉机手的响应。在罗马尼亚，保证每天至少收割两万公斤谷物的联合收割机手正在一天比一天增多。
    农业操作的机械化是提高收获量和使劳动农民相信社会主义道路的好处的主要方法。因此，不断扩大农业操作的机械化成为近几年内罗马尼亚农业中最迫切的任务之一。为了达到这个目的，就要用新型的拖拉机和架空运输装置来装备机器拖拉机站和国营农场，这样才能使田间管理和收割方面的工作，使供应、调制饲料以及畜牧业部门中的繁重操作广泛机械化。
    此外，摆在我国农业机器操使者面前的一项任务，就是更加充分地利用机器，使它们发挥更大的生产效能和赢利性。在这方面，改进对拖拉机和农业机器的保养和检修工作是需要解决的一个重要问题。最近几年，机械中心、进行拖拉机和收割联合机大检修的专业化企业网，将要扩大和巩固。在机器拖拉机站、国营农场和拖拉机工作队的营舍中将要修建新的机械修配厂。
    农业机械化的发展和改善，在很大程度上取决于向社会主义农业企业供应熟练的技术干部的工作。近年来，各学校培养出了许许多多的工程师、机务技师、生产队的领导人以及掌握了新技术并能顺利地运用农艺学成就的拖拉机手。机器拖拉机站和国营农场从工业企业那里不断获得设备和干部方面的援助。来自工业中心的技术干部方面的援助，大大促进工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟的不断巩固。
    现在，罗马尼亚的农业机器工人正在扩大着机械化工作的数量和种类，不断提高机械化工作的质量并降低生产成本。他们对促进农业的高涨和提高劳动人民的物质生活水平的贡献正在日益增加。
