The workers' spare-time education in factories, mines, and enterprises, and in various districts of Beijing has seen relatively significant development this semester. The state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory has 2,800 workers enrolled, more than double the number enrolled before the winter vacation. The number of students enrolled in spare-time middle and primary schools at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is over 8,200.

Among the more than 1,000 cadres and workers studying in the spare-time middle and primary schools of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, all have signed learning pledges. Their study time has increased from four class hours per week to twelve, and the attendance rate has increased from over 70% in the past to 90%. Eighteen graduates of the plant's spare-time middle school have been admitted to the secondary and vocational night schools attached to the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School.
