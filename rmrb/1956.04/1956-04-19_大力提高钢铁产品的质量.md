Vigorously Improve the Quality of Steel Products
Xiao Mingwei

    With the development of industrial and agricultural production and construction in our country, the machinery industry and the national defense industry require the supply of more steel of greater quantity, variety, and better quality. Therefore, the iron and steel industry should further tap its potential, strive to increase production, vigorously improve the quality of steel, and reduce waste products in order to better meet the needs.

    In recent years, iron and steel enterprises have made certain achievements in improving product quality. In 1953, according to Soviet standards, standards were established for twenty-three major steel products, and production was organized according to these standards. Previously, China's steel products used backward British, German, and Japanese production standards, but now they have been uniformly adopting advanced Soviet production standards. At the same time, by adopting new standards, many new scientific and technological achievements and production experiences, especially advanced Soviet scientific and technological achievements, have been rapidly promoted to production, improving product quality. For example, the adoption of advanced Soviet technical operating experience has greatly improved the variable stress, wear resistance, and impact resistance indicators of ball bearing steel.

    However, the quality of steel products is still not high. In 1955, the steel enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry produced 30,000 tons of waste steel ingots and 20,000 tons of waste steel products (this does not include defective products that left the factory due to lax technical inspection work). In 1955, Anshan Iron and Steel Company received 312 complaints about the poor quality of forty kinds of products. This situation has not changed significantly, and the quality of many important products is still very low. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant failed to meet the quality plans for most of its products in January and February this year.

    In recent years, the high ash content of coke has not changed much. In January this year, the ash content of coke at Anshan Iron and Steel was 13.14%, and at Benxi Iron and Steel Company it was 13.54%, only 0.36% to 0.76% lower than the coke ash content in 1952. Coke is the fuel for ironmaking, and every 1% reduction in coke ash content can increase the production capacity of the blast furnace by 2.5%. The ash content of coke in the Soviet Union is around 9%. If the ash content of coke in our country can be reduced to the Soviet standard, the country can produce hundreds of thousands of tons more pig iron every year without increasing the number of blast furnaces.

    According to scientific research and industrial test results, the quality of steel is mainly affected by inclusions in the steel (insufficient purity), gases in the steel, and segregation during the solidification process. The chemical composition segregation of large boiling steel ingots produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company seriously affects the quality of hundreds of thousands of tons of steel. Due to the segregation of the steel composition, the yield of Class A steel large steel products is only about 30%. The non-uniformity of plates in boiling steel is also a problem that has not been solved for a long time. The tensile strength on the same steel plate differs by more than four kilograms. Because of this, it is not possible to fully supply bridge steel for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and steel plates for the shipbuilding industry.

    The thin plate waste caused by non-metallic inclusions is also very alarming. From October to November 1955, about 8% of the roofing panels with a thickness of less than 0.6 mm produced by Anshan Iron and Steel were scrapped due to non-metallic inclusions. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant needs a large amount of high-quality steel plates. If the problem of non-metallic inclusions in steel plates cannot be solved in time, the quality of automobiles will be adversely affected.

    The carbon tool steel and alloy tool steel supplied by Dalian Steel Plant to Harbin, Shanghai and other places last year for manufacturing tools also only reached 61.8% of the quantity that should have been delivered due to poor product quality. This situation has not changed in the first quarter of this year.

    The above situation shows that the poor quality of steel products has caused difficulties for the machinery manufacturing industry and certain basic construction projects, and is now seriously threatening the completion of the plans of the machinery manufacturing industry and certain construction projects. Therefore, taking effective measures quickly to improve the quality of steel products has become the most important task of all employees in the current steel industry.

    The poor quality of many important steel products, and the lack of significant improvement over a long period of time, is related to the fact that the leading organs of the enterprise and some people in the enterprise do not pay attention to product quality. They have not implemented the principle of "accelerating" and "increasing" on the basis of "better" and "more economical." In enterprises, those who neglect product quality have neither been criticized by public opinion nor have they been criticized or disciplined by leaders or leading organs. Therefore, to improve the quality of steel, it is necessary to fight against those phenomena that neglect product quality.

    The poor quality of steel products is also due to the conservative thinking of some leaders and personnel in enterprises regarding improving product quality. They excessively emphasize the difficulties in improving product quality, but rarely promote advanced experiences and new technologies that can improve product quality. For example, our country has a large amount of high-quality gas-rich bituminous coal, which contains very little ash and sulfur. If it is used in the coking industry, it will play a great role in reducing the ash content of coke. However, research institutions and coking enterprises have not done so. In the production of special steel, the advanced Soviet experience of adopting a smelting inspection system to ensure the quality of steel has not been seriously promoted in various special steel plants. The vacuum treatment technology, which is most effective in eliminating gases in steel, has not been used.

    The poor quality of steel products is also due to the fact that many enterprises have not done a good job in technical infrastructure. In 1955, the Ministry of Heavy Industry formulated basic technical operating procedures for coking, iron and steel, and refractory materials based on advanced Soviet experience. If these procedures are implemented, product quality can be guaranteed. However, the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Iron and Steel Industry Administration have not further organized subordinate enterprises to implement these technical regulations. The chemical analysis and testing work of many enterprises, especially the rapid analysis work, has not been established or improved. The situation of releasing steel before the analysis results are available still occurs. In the first two months of this year, Fushun Steel Plant and Taiyuan Steel Plant caused nearly 100 tons of products with unqualified chemical composition for this reason. From the steelmaking to the rolling and forging workshop, the problem of controlling the temperature has not been well solved. The phenomenon of incomplete and inaccurate instruments is also very common, which not only cannot help operators control production, but also confuses operators. Because the central laboratory has not been established, the reasons for the poor quality of many products are not clear.

    In short, improving the quality of steel is an extremely arduous task. On the one hand, it is necessary to establish a strong concept of quality among all employees; on the other hand, it is also necessary to carry out a series of technical and organizational work, such as resolutely implementing technical operating procedures, strengthening technical supervision, strengthening scientific research, and appropriately improving backward equipment. It is impossible to succeed without either of these two aspects of work.

    大力提高钢铁产品的质量
    肖明伟
    随着我国工农业生产和建设事业的发展，机械工业和国防工业要求供应数量和品种更多、质量更好的钢铁。因此，钢铁工业应该进一步挖掘潜力，努力增加生产，大力改善钢铁质量，减少废品，以便更好地满足需要。
    几年来，钢铁企业在改进产品质量方面，已经取得一定的成绩。1953年，根据苏联标准，制定了二十三种主要钢铁产品的标准，并且按照这个标准组织生产。以前，我国的钢铁产品是采用英国的、德国的、日本的落后生产标准的，现在已经统一采用苏联先进的生产标准。同时，通过采用新标准，将许多新的科学技术成就和生产经验，特别是苏联的先进科学技术成就，迅速推广到生产中去，提高了产品质量。例如采用苏联的先进技术操作经验后，大大提高了滚珠钢的可变性应力，抗磨性和抗冲力指标。
    但是，钢铁的产品质量仍然不高。1955年重工业部所属钢铁企业，生产了三万吨废钢锭，二万吨废钢材（这还没有包括由于技术检查工作不严密，而出厂了的废品）。1955年鞍山钢铁公司收到了312件对四十种产品质量低劣的抗议。这种情况，现在还没有显著的改变，许多重要产品的质量仍然很低。太原钢铁厂今年一、二月份大部分产品的质量计划都没完成。
    几年来，焦炭灰分高的情况，一直没多大改变。今年一月份，鞍钢焦炭灰分为13.14％，本溪钢铁公司为13.54％，比1952年的焦炭灰分只降低了0.36％到0.76％。焦炭是炼铁的燃料，焦炭灰分每降低1％，可以使高炉生产能力提高2.5％。苏联的焦炭灰分都在9％左右，如果我国的焦炭灰分能够降低到苏联的指标，就可以在不增加高炉的情况下，每年给国家多生产几十万吨生铁。
    根据科学研究和工业试验的结果，钢的质量在目前主要是钢中夹杂（纯洁度不够），钢中有气体和钢在凝固过程中产生偏析等缺陷。鞍钢生产的大型沸腾钢锭的化学成份偏析，严重地影响了数十万吨钢的质量。由于钢的成份偏析，甲类钢大型钢材的收得率只有30％左右。沸腾钢中板的不均匀性，也是长期没得到解决的一个问题。同一张钢板上，抗张强度相差四公斤以上。因为这个缘故，就不能充分供应武汉长江大桥用的桥梁钢材和造船工业用的钢板。
    由于非金属夹杂所造成的薄板废品，也是很惊人的。1955年10月到11月，鞍钢生产的厚度在0.6公厘以下的屋面板，因为非金属夹杂而报废的约占总产量的8％。第一汽车制造厂需要大量优质钢板，如果钢板的非金属夹杂问题不能及时解决，汽车的质量将受到不好的影响。
    大连钢厂在去年供给哈尔滨和上海等地制造工具用的炭素工具钢材和合金工具钢材，也因为产品质量不好，实际交货量只达到应该交货量的61.8％。今年第一季这种情况还没有改变。
    上述情况都说明了，钢铁产品质量不好，已经给机械制造工业和某些基本建设工程造成了困难，而且现在还严重地威胁着机械制造工业和某些建设工程的计划的完成。因此，迅速采取有效措施，提高钢铁产品质量，已经成为当前钢铁工业全体职工最重要的任务。
    许多重要的钢铁产品质量不好，并且在很长时期内没有显著改进，跟企业的领导机关和企业中的一部分人员不重视产品质量有关。他们没有贯彻执行在“又好”和“又省”的基础上“加快”和“加多”的方针。在企业中，忽视产品质量的人既没有受到群众舆论的指责，也没有受到领导人员或领导机关的批评或处分。因此，要提高钢铁的质量，就必须向那些忽视产品质量的现象作斗争。
    钢铁产品质量不好，也还因为领导机关和企业中的一部分人员，对提高产品质量存在着保守思想。他们过分地强调提高产品质量方面的困难，却很少推广能够提高产品质量的先进经验和新技术。例如我国有大量的优质瓦斯肥煤，其中所含灰分和硫磺都很少。如果把它利用到炼焦工业中来，就会对降低焦炭灰分起很大的作用，但是，研究机关和炼焦企业没有这样做。在特殊钢生产中，采用熔炼检查制度，可以保证钢的质量的苏联先进经验，也没有在各特殊钢厂中认真推广。对消除钢中气体最有效的真空处理技术经验，也没有被运用。
    钢铁产品质量不好，也还因为许多企业没有作好技术基础工作。1955年重工业部根据苏联先进经验制定了焦化、钢铁和耐火材料的基本技术操作规程，如果执行这些规程，就可以保证产品质量。但是，重工业部和钢铁工业管理局没有进一步组织所属企业贯彻执行这些技术规程。许多企业的化验检验工作，特别是快速分析工作，还没有建立或健全起来。不等分析结果就出钢的情形，仍在发生。在今年头二个月中，抚顺钢厂和太原钢厂因为这个原因造成了近百吨的化学成分不合格的产品。从炼钢到轧锻车间，也没有很好解决控制温度的问题。计器不全不准的现象也很普遍，这不仅不能帮助操作人员控制生产，反而迷惑了操作人员。由于中心试验室没有建立起来，许多产品质量不好的原因也弄不清楚。
    总之，提高钢铁的质量，是一个极艰巨的工作。一方面需要在全体职工中，树立坚强的质量观念；另一方面也需要进行一系列的技术工作和组织工作，如坚决贯彻执行技术操作规程，加强技术监督，加强科学研究，适当改进落后设备等。这两方面工作缺少任何一方面，都是不行的。
