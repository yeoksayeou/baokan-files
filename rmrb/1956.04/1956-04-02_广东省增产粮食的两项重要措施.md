Two Important Measures for Increasing Grain Production in Guangdong Province
Lin Li Wu Erxiang

Guangdong Province, in formulating its agricultural production plan, regards eliminating waterlogging and drought disasters and developing fertilizer sources as two important measures for realizing various agricultural production reforms and increasing grain production.

    Eliminating Ordinary Waterlogging and Drought Disasters in Two Years

Guangdong has more than 40 million mu of land for planting rice. Among them, 15 million mu have irrigation equipment and basically sufficient water; nearly 20 million mu have irrigation equipment but insufficient water; and 6 million to 7 million mu are "rain-fed fields" without any irrigation equipment. Since last winter, after increasing the construction of water conservancy projects in accordance with the principle of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," the province has increased irrigation equipment for 3 million mu of rice fields in the past three months alone. At the same time, it has also repaired and improved the irrigation equipment for 7 million mu of rice fields. Because of this achievement, Guangdong Province has once again revised its original water conservancy plan, deciding to eliminate ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters in the next two years.

In order to summarize the achievements of water conservancy work and exchange experiences in overcoming waterlogging and drought disasters, Guangdong Province recently held an agricultural production exhibition, which specially set up a water conservancy hall.

The first part of the exhibits in the water conservancy hall is an analysis and introduction of Guangdong's natural conditions. From these analyses and introductions, it can be seen that Guangdong has its favorable conditions in developing water conservancy undertakings; but it also has its special difficulties. The favorable conditions are that there are many rivers, with more than 300 medium and large rivers; at the same time, the rainfall is sufficient. The difficulty is that the rainfall is uneven, the distribution of rivers is uneven, and the rainwater is mostly concentrated in summer and autumn, which cannot meet the needs of three crops a year. Guangdong is located in the subtropics, and the evaporation is particularly large. If it does not rain for eight or ten days, a drought will form.

In the past few years, Guangdong has done a lot of work in water conservancy and has achieved great results. The water conservancy investment in the past three years alone has been 75.91 million yuan. This is only the state's investment, and it only accounts for 23% of the entire water conservancy project cost. State loans of equal amount and larger amounts of funds raised by the masses are not included. People used this money to build 45,118 mountain ponds and reservoirs, dug 470,000 wells, and built 202,593 weirs and canals, as well as many other water conservancy projects.

The exhibition showed the achievements of water conservancy construction and focused on the anti-drought struggle last year. Before April last year, there had been no rain in Guangdong for more than 200 consecutive days, and there was a drought unseen in decades. However, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the local people reduced the 19 million mu of disaster-stricken land to 570,000 mu. Under the severe threat of drought, Guangdong's total grain output not only did not decrease, but also saw three grain "thousand-catty" yielding counties and more than 900 "thousand-catty" yielding cooperatives. In this process, the people of Guangdong carried out an unprecedented struggle, and many inspiring deeds emerged. The people of Chao'an, Chenghai, and Jieyang created a method of blocking the Han River to obtain water for farmland. After that, Guangdong launched a widespread struggle to block rivers from the Han River in the east to the Leizhou Peninsula in the west, forcing rivers throughout the province to reverse flow in 21,448 places. In the western Guangdong counties with fewer rivers, a large-scale well-digging campaign was launched. A total of 423,861 wells were dug in the province during this period, exceeding the number of wells dug in the previous years by eight or nine times. In areas near mountains with distant water sources and where it was not easy to dig wells, people used "dragon bone" waterwheels to connect long suction channels to draw water from distant rivers. The heroic struggle of the people of Guangdong not only stabilized Guangdong's grain output in 1955 at the level of 1954, but also increased people's confidence and courage in overcoming natural disasters.

Numerous examples show that Guangdong Province can eliminate ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters within two years.

            Extensively Developing Fertilizer Sources

Increasing fertilizer application is another fundamental measure for Guangdong Province to realize agricultural production reform and increase grain production. From the first hall of the Guangdong Agricultural Production Exhibition, it can be seen that Guangdong Province's fertilizer sources are extremely rich. Due to the mild climate, Guangdong has more than 10 million mu of winter fallow land, which can be used to plant green manure crops such as vetch and purple cloud British; wild green manure is everywhere, and more than 100 kinds of wild green manure are currently known. The areas near the river have inexhaustible river mud. Where there are ponds, pond mud can be dug up for fertilizer. Guangdong has a very long coastline, and sea mud, seaweed, algae, sea snails, and shells are all top-quality fertilizers. Old soil from houses and walls, and garbage around villages, can also be used in large quantities to fertilize fields. Human and animal excrement and the straw of various crops have not been well utilized in the past, and the potential is still great.

In the past few years, Party organizations and government departments at all levels in Guangdong have led the masses to vigorously accumulate fertilizer, initially overcoming the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer supply and ensuring the needs of agricultural production increase. Many farmlands have been transformed from barren to fertile fields, and low-yielding fields have been transformed into high-yielding fields due to the application of farm-made fertilizers. The exhibition displayed two pieces of field soil. One was from Yuelisha Village, Nanhai County, with a thick soil layer, loose soil texture, and dark black color. This was the result of years of applying soil and miscellaneous fertilizers such as garbage, with an annual yield of 1,120 catties of rice per mu. The other was from Ou Ying, a farmer in Ronggang District, Nanhai County. Because he had been using ammonium sulfate alone for a long time, the soil was hard, lacking organic matter, and strongly acidic, with a yield of only 570 catties per mu. Obviously, the application of various soil miscellaneous fertilizers and green manure has a significant effect on improving soil and increasing grain production, and at the same time can reduce production costs. In the sandy soil areas of the Pearl River Delta, farmers rely on digging river mud and pond mud for fertilizer to ensure the fertilizer needs for intercropping and continuous cropping of rice. From last winter to now, the farmers here have dug enough river mud for more than 800,000 mu of fields, with 600 dan of river mud applied per mu, which is equivalent to applying more than 1 million dan of ammonium sulfate, which is equivalent to saving more than 20 million yuan in fertilizer investment.

Many objects, charts, and models in the exhibition vividly proved that as long as the masses are mobilized to discover and collect them, farm fertilizers are inexhaustible and inexhaustible. The farmers in Chao'an County, a "thousand-catty" grain producing county, mostly used commercial fertilizers in the past. In recent years, the Chao'an County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the masses to collect large amounts of garbage, human and animal excrement, pond mud, river mud, etc. as fertilizer, which has initially met the needs of farmers to increase production. At the same time, the county party committee also mobilized district and township cadres to go deep into the farmers to discover fertilizer sources. They learned from an old farmer in Gubantou Township about the rich sea mud buried underground. This sea mud contains more than 40% organic matter and is a top-quality fertilizer. This discovery provided an important guarantee for the county's agricultural production increase. Places that were previously considered to have no fertilizer to accumulate now have an average of more than 10,000 catties of fertilizer accumulated per mu. In the past two or three months, the province has accumulated 2 billion dan of soil and miscellaneous fertilizers, which is more than double the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the entire year of 1954.

Improving fertilizer preservation and fertilization techniques is an important task to improve fertilizer efficiency and save fertilizer. A chart in the exhibition told us that as long as human and animal manure can be fully and rationally utilized, the province's fertilizer problem can be basically solved. However, in many areas, there are still no toilets for people, no pens for cattle, and no pens for pigs. Many manure pits are not covered, and some people mix human and animal manure with ash and apply it after composting, while others dry livestock manure in the sun before applying it to the fields, reducing the fertilizer efficiency. Another chart in the exhibition told us that if human and animal manure is not covered, 30% of the nitrogen will be lost in one month; if it is mixed with ash and composted, 27% of the nitrogen will be lost in three days. It can be seen how much waste there is in this regard. However, the farmers of Guangdong Province have also created many advanced methods of fertilizer preservation and fertilization. In the Chaoshan area, human and animal manure is stored in deep pits with small diameters. Usually, human and animal manure, sewage, green manure, vegetable scraps, etc. are stored in it, and used only after composting. If the practices of the Chaoshan area can be promoted throughout the province, all human and animal manure can be effectively utilized.

The exhibition also introduced various advanced fertilization methods. By adopting mixed fertilization methods, organic fertilizer efficiency can be increased by three times. Granular fertilizer is a granular fertilizer made by mixing compost powder and chemical fertilizer. It is very convenient to apply and the fertilizer efficiency can be increased by two times. Concentrated fertilization is a method of saving fertilizer inherent to farmers. However, there are still not many people in Guangdong who use these advanced fertilization methods. If these fertilization methods are actively promoted, more than half of the fertilizer can be saved.

    广东省增产粮食的两项重要措施
    林里　吴尔祥
    广东省在制定农业生产规划的时候，把消灭水旱灾害，开辟肥源，做为实现各种农业生产改革、增产粮食的两项重要措施。
      两年消灭普通的水旱灾害
    广东有种植稻谷的田地四千多万亩。其中，有灌溉设备，水量基本充足的田地是一千五百万亩；有灌溉设备，但是水量不足的田地将近二千万亩；毫无灌溉设备的“望天田”，是六百万到七百万亩。自从去年冬天，按照“全面规划，加强领导”的方针增修水利工程以后，仅在近三个月中，全省就增加了三百万亩稻田的灌溉设备。同时，还整修和改善了七百万亩稻田的灌溉设备。因为有了这个成绩，广东省又一次修改了原订的水利计划，决定在今明两年期间，消灭普通的水旱灾害。
    为了总结水利工作的成绩，交流战胜水旱灾害的经验，广东省最近举办的农业生产展览会，特别设立了一个水利馆。
    水利馆的第一部分展品，是对广东自然条件的分析和介绍。从这些分析和介绍来看：广东在发展水利事业方面，有它的有利条件；但是也有它的特殊困难。有利条件是河流纵横，只中型和大型的江河就有三百多条；同时，雨量充足。困难的是雨量不匀，河流分布不均，雨水又多集中在夏秋两季，不能满足一年三熟作物的需要。广东地处亚热带，蒸发量特别大，十天八天不下雨，就会形成旱灾。
    这几年来，广东在水利事业方面做了许多工作，并且获得了巨大成绩。单是近三年来的水利投资，就有7，591万元。这只是国家的投资，也只占整个水利工程费用的23％。为数相等的国家贷款和数量更大的群众自筹款项，都没有计算在内。人们用这些钱，修建了山塘水库45，118处，打了水井47万眼，陂圳渠道202，593处，还有其他许多水利工程。
    展览会展出水利建设的成绩，又着重展览了去年的抗旱斗争。去年四月以前，广东境内连续二百多天没有下雨，出现了数十年来所没有见过的旱灾。但是在党和人民政府的领导下，当地人民把一千九百万亩的受灾土地，缩小成了五十七万亩。在严重的旱灾威胁下，广东的粮食总产量不但没有减少，而且出现了三个粮食千斤丰产县和九百多个千斤丰产社。在这当中，广东人民进行了史无前例的斗争，也出现了许多振奋人心的事迹。潮安、澄海和揭阳的人民创造了封锁韩江、取得农田用水的办法。在这以后，广东就在东起韩江，西至雷州半岛的大小河流上，掀起了普遍地封江堵河的斗争，迫使全省河流在21，448个地方倒流。在河流较少的粤西各县，开展了大规模的打井运动。总计全省在这一时期打井423，861眼，超过了以前几年打井数量的八、九倍。在近山水远又不易打井的地区，人们用“龙骨”水车，接成长长的吸水道，把远在江河的水流吸上来。广东人民的英勇斗争，不仅使广东省1955年的粮食产量稳定在1954年的水平上，而且增加了人们战胜自然灾害的信心和勇气。
    许许多多的实例说明：广东省能够在两年内消灭普通的水旱灾害。
            广泛开辟肥源
    增施肥料也是广东省实现农业生产改革、增产粮食的另一个根本措施。从广东省农业生产展览会的第一馆内可以看出：广东省的肥料来源是极其丰富的。由于气候温和，广东省有一千多万亩冬闲田，都可以利用来种植苕子、紫云英等绿肥作物；野生绿肥到处都是，目前已经知道名字的野生绿肥就有一百多种。近河的地区有取之不尽的河泥。有水塘的地方可以挖掘塘泥做肥料。广东省海岸线很长，海泥、海草、海藻、海螺、贝壳等都是上等的肥料。房屋上、墙上的旧土，村庄周围的垃圾，也都可以大量利用来肥田。人畜粪尿和各种作物的秸秆，过去也没有很好地加以利用，潜力还很大。
    几年来，广东省各级党组织和政府部门领导群众大力积肥，初步克服了肥料供应不足的困难，保证了农业增产的需要。许多农田由于施用农家自积的肥料，使瘦田变成了肥田，低产田变成了高产田。展览会里展出了两块田土，一块是从南海县岳利沙村弄来的，土层很厚，土质松软，土色深黑，这是连年施用垃圾等土杂肥的结果，每亩年产稻谷1，120斤；另一块是南海县?岗区农民欧英的田土，因为他长期单纯施用硫酸铵，土质硬实，有机质缺乏，酸性强，每亩产量只有570斤。很明显，施用各种土杂肥和绿肥，对改良土壤、提高粮食产量有显著的功效，同时还可以降低生产成本。在珠江三角洲的沙田地区，农民就是依靠挖掘河泥、塘泥做肥料，保证了水稻间作改连作的肥料需要。从去年冬天到现在，这里的农民已挖河泥够上八十多万亩田，每亩上河泥六百担，加起来，就相当于施硫酸铵一百多万担，也就等于节约了二千多万元的肥料投资。
    展览会上许多实物、图表、模型都生动地证明了：只要发动群众去发现、搜集，农家肥料是取之不尽、用之不竭的。水稻千斤丰产县潮安县的农民，过去大都是使用商品肥料的。近年来，中共潮安县委发动群众大量收积垃圾、人畜粪尿、塘泥、河泥等作肥料，就初步地满足了农民增产的需要。同时，县委又发动区乡干部深入到农民中间去发现肥源。他们在古板头乡的一个老农民那里了解到埋藏在地底下的丰富的海泥。这种海泥含有有机质40％以上，是上等的肥料。这个发现为全县农业增产提供了重要的保证。一向认为无肥可积的地方，现在有的平均每亩已积肥一万斤以上。全省在这两、三个月间，就积了二十亿担的土杂肥，比1954年全年的积肥量多出一倍以上。
    改进保肥和施肥技术，是提高肥效、节约肥料的一项重要工作。展览会里一张图表告诉我们：只要能够充分地合理地利用人畜粪尿，全省肥料问题就可以基本上解决。但是目前不少地区还是人无厕所，牛无栏，猪无圈。许多粪坑没有加盖，有的还把人畜粪尿混合草木灰积沤施用，有的把家畜粪晒干了下田，减低了肥效。展览会里的另外一张图表告诉我们：人畜粪尿没有加盖，一个月损失氮素30％；如果混合草木灰积沤，三天就损失氮素27％。可见在这方面的浪费有多么大。但是广东省农民也创造出许多先进的保肥和施肥的方法。潮汕地区用口径很小深坑贮藏人畜粪尿，平时可以把人畜粪尿、污水、绿肥、菜屑等都积藏在里面，沤到腐熟了才使用。如果能够把潮汕地区的做法在全省推广，所有的人畜粪尿就可以得到有效的利用。
    展览会上还介绍了各种先进施肥方法。采用混合施肥方法，有机质肥效可以提高三倍。颗粒肥料是用堆肥粉和化学肥料混合制成的粒状肥料，施用很方便，肥效可以提高两倍。集中施肥是农民固有的节约施肥的方法。但是目前广东采用这些先进的施肥方法的人还不多，如果积极推广这些施肥方法，就可以节约肥料一半以上。
