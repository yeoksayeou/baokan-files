Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 6th – Elections for members of the House of Representatives of the Ceylon Parliament began on April 5th. Incomplete statistics from the first day of voting indicate that the opposition coalition, the People's United Front, is in the lead in terms of votes.

    Ceylon's 3.5 million voters are to elect 95 members of the House of Representatives in this election. In addition, six members of parliament will be appointed by the Governor-General of Ceylon. More than one-third of all voters cast their ballots on April 5th. The remaining voters will continue to vote on April 7th and April 10th.

    As of the morning of April 6th, the results of thirty-two seats have been announced. Among them, the People's United Front won twenty-one seats, the ruling United National Party five seats, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party four seats, the Communist Party one seat, and independents one seat. Five ministers of the current cabinet, including Finance Minister J.R. Jayewardene, Home Minister A. Ratnayake, and Commerce Minister C.W.W. Kannangara, have already lost their seats.

    On the eve of the election, the United National Party published a program of "anti-communist neutrality." According to the Associated Press, this is a program of not participating in the "Cold War" but "ideologically standing on the side of the West." The United National Party advocates declaring Sinhalese (Sinhalese account for 70% of the population of Ceylon) as the national language to replace English.

    The People's United Front's election manifesto advocates establishing a democratic republic, abolishing "security" laws, and gradually nationalizing foreign (British) plantations, banks, and insurance companies. It also advocates granting workers and state employees full trade union rights. The People's United Front advocates not participating in international conflicts, abolishing foreign bases in Ceylon, and withdrawing foreign troops. It suggests immediately making Sinhalese the national language while advocating the protection of the right to use Tamil.

    The Communist Party in the election advocated that Ceylon become a democratic republic, strive to establish peaceful and friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the principles adopted at the Bandung Conference, and support the struggle against colonialism. It advocates striving for equality between Sinhalese and Tamil languages.

    This election was originally scheduled to be held after the expiration of the term of the previous parliament in 1957. However, because the ruling United National Party decided to use only Sinhalese as the official language, the parliament was dissolved early in February in order to decide through a general election what language Ceylon should adopt as the official language.

    锡兰举行大选
    新华社6日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰国会众议院议员的选举已经在四月五日开始。第一天投票的不完全统计表明反对党联盟人民联合阵线得票占先。
    锡兰的三百五十万选民在这次选举当中要选出九十五名众议院议员。另外还有六名众议员将由锡兰总督指定。全体选民的三分之一以上在四月五日投了票。其余的选民将在四月七日和四月十日继续投票。
    到四月六日上午为止，已经宣布了三十二个议席的选举结果。其中人民联合阵线获得二十一席，现在执政的统一国民党五席，新平等社会党四席，共产党一席，独立人士一席。现任内阁有五个部长包括财政部长贾雅瓦德尼、内政部长拉纳雅克和商务部长科里亚等人在内已经落选。
    在选举前夕，统一国民党发表了“反共中立”的纲领。据美联社记者说，这是一个不参加“冷战”、但是“在意识形态上站在西方这边”的纲领。统一国民党主张宣布僧伽罗语（僧伽罗人占锡兰人口70％）为国语，以代替英语。
    人民联合阵线的竞选宣言主张建立一个民主共和国、取消“治安”法令、把外国
  （英国）的种植园、银行和保险公司逐步收归国有。它还主张给予工人和国家职员以充分的工会权利。人民联合阵线主张不参加国际冲突，取消在锡兰的外国基地和撤退外国军队。它建议立刻把僧伽罗语作为国语，同时主张保护使用泰米尔语的权利。
    共产党在竞选中主张锡兰成为一个民主共和国、争取在万隆会议通过的原则的基础上同一切国家建立和平和友好关系，支持反对殖民主义的斗争。它主张争取僧伽罗语和泰米尔语平等。
    这次选举本来应该在上届国会1957年任满以后举行，由于执政的统一国民党决定只用僧伽罗语作为官方语言，国会提前在二月间解散，以便通过一次普选来决定锡兰采用什么语言为官方语言的问题。
