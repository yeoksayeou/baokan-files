Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 8th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR have issued a letter to all Soviet agricultural workers, calling on them to successfully carry out this year's agricultural work.

    The letter to all Soviet agricultural workers points out that, due to the efforts of Soviet agricultural workers, the production of agriculture and animal husbandry in the Soviet Union and the state purchase and procurement volume of agricultural and livestock products have increased last year. The production of certain products in some areas has approached the 1960 level stipulated by the January Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee last year. The cash income of many collective farms in all republics and states has greatly increased, which has greatly improved the cash remuneration for workdays.

    Currently, the entire Soviet people are fighting with the greatest enthusiasm to complete the great tasks put forward by the 20th National Congress of the CPSU to further develop all sectors of the national economy and improve the material and cultural level of the people. The CPC Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the USSR call on all agricultural workers to successfully carry out agricultural work this year, because the decisive moment has arrived to guarantee not only the realization but also the ahead-of-schedule and greatly exceeding the resolutions of the 20th National Congress on agricultural production. The sooner the task is completed, the better, because in this way, the products produced will more fully meet the growing needs of the Soviet people.

    The CPC Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the USSR pointed out that there are now very good conditions for greatly increasing the production of milk and meat this year, and ensuring that the state obtains sufficient quantities of these products. At present, agricultural workers in Voronezh Oblast, Ukraine, Krasnodar Krai, Tambov Oblast, and other regions are launching a socialist competition, and are successfully completing the huge tasks they have proposed to increase the production of agricultural products. If agricultural workers in other regions also do so, then it can be confidently said that the tasks stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan for milk and meat production can be completed nationwide in two to a maximum of three years. The task of leading personnel at all levels of Party organizations, Soviets and agricultural organs, collective farms, machine tractor stations and state farms is: they must do their best to ensure that agricultural production plans start from maximizing the use of existing potential, thereby rapidly increasing the production of all agricultural and livestock products.

    The letter to all agricultural workers finally calls on every agricultural worker to treat their work better, always care about completing the resolutions of the 20th National Congress, and work selflessly to complete them, in order to improve the living standards of the Soviet people, contribute to strengthening the strength of the motherland, ensure the supply of necessary food to the country, supply raw materials to industry, and make the working people of capitalist countries, after seeing the lives of the Soviet people with their own eyes, convinced of the superiority of the Soviet social, state, and political system, and convinced of what people can create for themselves in a country where the working people are masters.

    苏共中央和苏联部长会议号召农业劳动者增加农牧产品
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科八日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议发布了告全体苏联农业劳动者书，号召他们成功地进行今年的农业工作。
    告全体苏联农业劳动者书指出，由于苏联农业劳动者的努力，去年苏联的农业和畜牧业生产以及农畜产品的国家征购和收购量已经增加了，有些地区的某些产品的生产已经接近苏共中央去年一月全体会议所规定的1960年的水平。所有的共和国和州的许多集体农庄的现金收入大大地增加了，这就使得劳动日的现金报酬有了很大的提高。
    目前，全体苏联人民正在以最大的热情为完成苏共第二十次代表大会所提出的进一步发展国民经济各部门以及提高人民物质和文化水平的宏伟任务而斗争。苏共中央和苏联部长会议号召全体农业劳动者在今年成功地进行农业工作，因为，保证不但实现而且提前和大大超额地实现第二十次代表大会关于农产品生产的决议的决定性关头已经到来。任务完成得越早越好，因为这样一来，生产出来的产品就会更加充分地满足苏联人民日益增长的需要。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议指出，现在已经有了十分良好的条件在今年就大量增产奶类和肉类，并且保证国家获得足够的这些产品。目前，沃罗涅日州、乌克兰、克拉斯诺达边疆区、坦波夫州和其他一些州的农业劳动者正在展开社会主义竞赛，并且正在顺利地完成他们提出的增加农产品生产的巨大任务，如果其它地区的农业劳动者也这样做，那么，就可以有信心地说，第六个五年计划为奶类和肉类生产规定的任务在全国范围内就可以在两年至多在三年内完成。各级党组织、苏维埃和农业机关、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导人员的任务在于：必须尽量做到使农业生产计划从最大限度地利用现有潜力出发，从而迅速地增加一切农业和畜牧业产品的生产。
    告全体农业劳动者书最后号召每一个农业劳动者更好地对待自己的工作，时刻关心完成第二十次代表大会的决议，并且为完成它们而忘我地劳动，以便提高苏联人民的生活水平，为加强祖国的实力而贡献力量，保证供给国家以必要的粮食，供给工业以原料，使资本主义国家的劳动人民在亲眼看到苏联人的生活以后，确信苏联的社会、国家和政治制度的优越性，确信在劳动人民当家作主的国家里人们能够替自己创造出什么东西来。
