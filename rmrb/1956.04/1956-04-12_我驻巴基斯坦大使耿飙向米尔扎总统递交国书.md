    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 11th — Geng Biao, Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China to Pakistan, accompanied by Counselor Chen Ying and others, presented his credentials to Mirza, President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, on April 10th.

    When presenting his credentials, Ambassador Geng Biao gave a eulogy to President Mirza. Geng Biao first spoke of the increasing cultural and trade relations and friendship between the two countries in recent years. He said that during the Bandung Conference, the Prime Ministers of our two countries had the opportunity to meet and had frank and sincere talks. This played a beneficial role in increasing our mutual understanding and friendship. Since the Bandung Conference, the mutual friendly visits of various delegations between our two countries have resulted in significant developments in our friendly relations.

    Geng Biao said that there are many common points between our two countries: we have both suffered from foreign aggression and oppression for a long time, and we have both undergone long anti-colonial struggles before gaining independence, so the people of our two countries have a common desire to oppose colonialism, demand peace, and get rid of economic backwardness. On this basis, there are broad possibilities for friendly cooperation, mutual assistance, and mutual learning between our two countries. I am deeply convinced that the upcoming friendly visit to China by your country’s Prime Minister will further develop the friendly relations between our two countries.

    President Mirza delivered a reply. He stated that since China and Pakistan established diplomatic relations, the relations between the two countries have been pleasant and harmonious, which makes myself and my government sincerely satisfied. I am deeply convinced that the friendship between our two countries—which has recently been greatly strengthened by the very popular visits of Ms. Soong Ching Ling and Marshal He Long—will continue to develop in the years to come.

    He said that Your Excellency mentioned the historic Asian-African Conference held in Bandung last year, and the connection established in person by the Prime Ministers of China and Pakistan in Bandung, which is indeed an auspicious sign. Our sincere wish is that the friendly relations between the two countries started in Bandung should be further developed. It is with this goal in mind that our Prime Minister has accepted the kind invitation of Mr. Zhou Enlai and the Government of the People’s Republic of China, and will visit China next month. I am deeply convinced that this mutual visit between the leaders of the two countries will not only benefit the friendship between China and Pakistan, but also world peace and progress.

    He also stated that Your Excellency mentioned the many common points between our two countries, and I agree with Your Excellency that these common points and the spirit of mutual cooperation and understanding indeed constitute a solid foundation for the friendly cooperation between our two countries, and the friendly cooperation between the two countries will bring welfare to the people of our two countries.

    我驻巴基斯坦大使耿飙向米尔扎总统递交国书
    据新华社11日讯　喀喇蚩消息：中华人民共和国驻巴基斯坦大使耿飙在四月十日偕同参赞陈应等向巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国总统米尔扎递交了国书。
    耿飙大使在递交国书时向米尔扎总统致颂词。耿飙首先谈到了几年来两国文化、贸易关系和友谊的日益增进。他说，在万隆会议期间，我们两国总理有机会会晤，并且作了坦白诚恳的会谈。这对于增加我们彼此之间的了解和友谊，起了有益的作用。万隆会议以来，我们两国之间各种代表团的相互友好访问，使我们的友好关系有了显著的发展。
    耿飙说，我们两国之间存在着许多共同点：我们都曾经长期遭受外来的侵略和压迫，我们都经过了长期的反殖民主义斗争才获得了独立，因而我们两国人民有着反对殖民主义、要求和平和摆脱经济落后的共同愿望。在这一基础上，贵我两国有着友好合作、互相帮助、互相学习的广泛可能性。我深信贵国总理不久以后去中国的友好访问，将使我们两国间的友好关系得到进一步的发展。
    米尔扎总统致答词。他说，自从中巴两国建立外交关系以来，两国的关系一直是愉快而和谐的，这件事使我本人和我的政府真诚地感到满意。我深信我们两国的友谊——最近宋庆龄女士阁下和贺龙元帅阁下的极受人欢迎的访问已经大大地加强了这种友谊——将会在未来的岁月里得到不断的发展。
    他说，阁下提到了去年在万隆举行的具有历史意义的亚非会议，并且提到了中巴两国总理亲自在万隆建立起来的联系，那的确是一个吉兆。我们的诚恳愿望是在万隆开始的。两国的友好关系应该得到进一步的发展。正是抱着这样的宗旨，我国总理已经接受了周恩来先生阁下和中华人民共和国政府盛意的邀请，并且将在下月访问中国。我深信两国领袖的这种相互访问，将不仅有利于中巴两国的友谊，也将有利于世界和平和进步。
    他说，阁下还提到了贵我两国间的许多共同点，我同意阁下的意见，即这些共同点和彼此合作互相了解的精神的确构成了贵我两国友好合作的坚固基础，而两国的友好合作将会给我们两国的人民带来福利。
