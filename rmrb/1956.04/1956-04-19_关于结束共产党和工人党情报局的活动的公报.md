Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th (TASS):

The establishment of the Communist and Workers' Information Bureau in 1947 played a positive role in eliminating the state of isolation between the communist parties of various countries that had formed after the dissolution of the Communist International. It was an important factor in strengthening proletarian internationalism within international communist movement, and further uniting the working class and all working people in the struggle for lasting peace, democracy, socialism. The Information Bureau and its newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" played a positive role in developing and strengthening the fraternal ties between the communist and workers' parties of various countries and exchanging each other's experiences, in clarifying the issues of applying Marxist-Leninist theory according to the specific conditions of each country, and in clarifying the experience of the international communist movement and the workers' movement. All of this promoted the ideological, organizational, and political consolidation of the fraternal parties, as well as the strengthening of the Communist Party's influence among the masses.

At the same time, the following changes have taken place in the international situation in recent years: Socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country and become a world system; the formation of a vast "peace zone" including socialist countries in Europe and Asia and non-socialist peace-loving countries; the growth and consolidation of many communist parties in capitalist countries, dependent countries and colonial countries, and the strengthening of their activities in the struggle against the danger of war and reactionary forces, in the struggle for peace, the vital interests of the working people and the national independence of their own countries; and finally, the task of eliminating the division of the workers' movement and strengthening the unity of the working class for the victorious struggle for peace and socialism has now become urgent. All of this has created new conditions for the activities of the Communist and Workers' Parties.

The Communist and Workers' Information Bureau, both in terms of its composition and the content of its activities, is no longer suitable for these new conditions.

The Central Committees of the Communist and Workers' Parties participating in the Information Bureau, after exchanging views on the activities of the Information Bureau, considered that the Information Bureau they established in 1947 had completed its mission. Therefore, after mutual consultation, they decided to end the activities of the Communist and Workers' Information Bureau and cease publication of the Information Bureau's newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!"

The Central Committees of the Communist and Workers' Parties that had participated in the Information Bureau believe that in the struggle for the interests of the working class, for peace, democracy, and the cause of socialism, in order to carry out their work in accordance with the common goals and tasks of Marxist-Leninist parties and in accordance with the national characteristics and conditions of their own countries, each party or several parties will certainly find new and effective ways to establish their connections and contacts. There is no doubt that the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries will continue, according to their needs and taking into account the specific conditions of their activities, to exchange views on common issues such as the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, the protection of the interests of the working class and all working people, and the mobilization of the masses of the people to participate in the struggle against the danger of war, and will also study the issue of cooperation with parties and factions with socialism as their goal and other organizations that hope to consolidate peace and democracy. All this will further strengthen the spirit of mutual cooperation between the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries in accordance with the principles of proletarian internationalism, and strengthen the fraternal ties between them to benefit the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

### 关于结束共产党和工人党情报局的活动的公报

    关于结束共产党和工人党情报局的活动的公报
    1947年共产党和工人党情报局的成立，在消除各国共产党之间在共产国际解散后所形成的隔膜状态方面起了积极的作用，对于加强国际共产主义运动队伍中的无产阶级国际主义，对于进一步团结工人阶级和全体劳动人民进行争取持久和平、民主和社会主义的斗争，是一个重要因素。情报局和它的机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”，在发展和加强各国共产党和工人党之间的兄弟联系和交流彼此的经验、在阐明根据各个国家具体条件运用马克思列宁主义理论的问题和阐明国际共产主义运动和工人运动的经验这些方面起了积极的作用。这些都促进了各兄弟党在思想上、组织上和政治上的巩固，以及共产党在群众中的影响的加强。
    与此同时，最近几年在国际局势中发生下列的变化：社会主义已经超出一个国家的范围而成为世界体系，包括欧亚两洲的社会主义国家和非社会主义的爱好和平国家在内的广大“和平地区”的形成，在资本主义国家、附属国和殖民地国家中的许多共产党的成长和巩固，这些共产党在同战争危险和反动势力进行的斗争中、在为和平、劳动人民的切身利益和本国的民族独立的斗争中的活动的加强，最后，目前已经迫切地提出了消除工人运动的分裂和加强工人阶级的团结一致以利于胜利地进行争取和平、争取社会主义的斗争的任务——这一切为共产党和工人党的活动创造了新的条件。
    共产党和工人党情报局无论就它的组成成员来说，无论就它的活动内容来说，都已经不适应这种新的条件了。
    参加情报局的各国共产党和工人党的中央委员会，就情报局的活动的问题交换了意见以后，认为：它们在1947年成立的情报局已经完成了自己的使命，为此，在经过相互协商之后决定：结束共产党和工人党情报局的活动，停止情报局的机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”的出版。
    曾经参加情报局的各国共产党和工人党的中央委员会认为，在为工人阶级利益、为和平、民主和社会主义事业而进行的斗争中，为了按照马克思列宁主义政党的共同目标和任务以及按照本国的民族特点和条件来开展自己的工作，每一个党或者几个党都一定会找出建立它们之间的联系和接触的新的有效方式。毫无疑问，各国共产党和工人党今后仍将根据自己的需要并且考虑到自己的活动的具体条件，就争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争，保护工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益，以及动员人民群众参加反对战争危险的斗争这样一些共同的问题互相交换意见，同时也将研究同那些以社会主义为目标的政党和派别、同希望巩固和平和民主的其他组织进行合作的问题。这一切将进一步加强各国共产党和工人党本着无产阶级国际主义的原则而互相合作的精神，加强它们之间的兄弟联系以有利于和平、民主和社会主义的事业。
