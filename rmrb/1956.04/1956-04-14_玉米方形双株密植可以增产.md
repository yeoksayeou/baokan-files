Square double-plant dense planting is one of the effective methods to increase the yield of corn per unit area. This method is a summary of the inherent planting experience of Chinese farmers under the inspiration of the advanced Soviet square hill planting method.

Experiments, research, and production practices in various places have proved that the yield increase effect of square double-plant dense planting is significant. According to the 1954 experiment of the Shanxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, corn cultivated under the same variety and cultivation conditions, the yield of double plants increased by 5.4% compared with single plants. In 1954, the Baiquan Experimental Station in Henan Province found that corn with 3,000 plants per mu increased by 7.6% with double plants compared with single plants. The results of the 1955 experiment by the Zhejiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences showed that with 3,000 plants per mu, double plants increased by 8.71% compared with single plants. The experiment of the Jilin Provincial Comprehensive Agricultural Experiment Station and the trial planting in the Jiaohe area showed that double-plant dense planting combined with concentrated fertilization increased the yield per mu by more than 50% compared with ordinary single-plant planting. In many areas of Sichuan, Hubei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang and other provinces, there is also experience in increasing yield through double-plant dense planting.

Corn is a crop with tall plants and large leaf area. If single plants are planted too densely, the stalks will be thin and weak, and the ears will be very small or not set due to poor ventilation and light transmission. Implementing square double-plant dense planting can overcome these shortcomings, and achieve both full utilization of land fertility, increasing the total number of plants per unit area, and allowing plants to be rationally distributed, with ventilation and light transmission in both vertical and horizontal directions, which is convenient for cultivation and field management, and is especially suitable for mechanized farming. This is an important reason why square double-plant dense planting of corn can increase unit yield.

Corn cultivated by square double-plant dense planting method requires more water and fertilizer. Therefore, areas using this method should solve the problems of irrigation water and increased fertilizer application.

    玉米方形双株密植可以增产
    朱丕荣
    方形双株密植是提高玉米单位面积产量的有效办法之一。这种方法是在苏联方形穴播先进栽培法的启示下总结出来的我国农民固有的种植经验。
    各地的试验研究和生产实践都证明方形双株密植的增产效果显著。据1954年山西省农业科学研究所的试验，在品种和耕作条件相同下栽培的玉米，双株比单株的增产5.4％。1954年河南省百泉试验站，每亩三千株的玉米，双株比单株增产7.6％。1955年浙江省农业科学研究所试验结果，每亩同为三千株，双株比单株增产8.71％。吉林省综合农业试验站的试验及在蛟河地区的试种，双株密植结合集中施肥，每亩产量比一般单株种植的增产50％以上。在四川、湖北、辽宁、黑龙江等省的不少地区也都有双株密植增产的经验。
    玉米是植株高、叶面大的作物，如果单株种植过密，就会由于通风透光不好，而秸秆细弱，结穗很小或不结穗。实行方形双株密植，就可以克服这些缺点，而做到既能充分利用地力，增加单位面积的总株数，又可以使植株得到合理分布，纵横都能通风透光，便于中耕和田间管理，特别适合机械耕作。这就是玉米方形双株密植可以提高单位产量的重要原因。
    采用方形双株密植的办法栽培的玉米需要较多的水分和肥料。因此，采用这种方法的地区，应该解决灌溉用水和增施肥料的问题。
