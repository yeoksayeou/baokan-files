Sastroamidjojo's Reply to Premier Zhou
To His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China:

    On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people, and in my personal name, I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of April 11, 1956. The expression of gratitude from the Government and people of the People's Republic of China for the assistance provided by the Indonesian Government and people in rescuing the victims of the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash, including members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference, has deeply moved us. We shall forever regard it as a symbol of the friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian Government and people, with the assistance of the investigating committee, rendered the aforementioned assistance and made other efforts to investigate the act of sabotage against the "Kashmir Princess" plane, merely in the service of their ideal of upholding humanitarianism and justice. May the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia, as well as the peoples of both countries, always be able to strive in a spirit of friendship to achieve these lofty ideals.
                                    Ali Sastroamidjojo
