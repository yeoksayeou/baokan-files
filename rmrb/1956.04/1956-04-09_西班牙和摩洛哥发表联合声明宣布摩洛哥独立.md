Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Paris: According to reports in Parisian newspapers, negotiations between Spain and Morocco regarding the future of Spanish Morocco officially began in Madrid on April 5. Moroccan Sultan Muhammad stated that these negotiations should end Morocco's state of division. He said, "Recognizing the unification of Moroccan territory on the basis of independence does not violate the interests of the Spanish nation. We are prepared to offer all necessary guarantees to Spaniards residing in Morocco, but this should in no way infringe upon our sovereignty." Spanish Head of State Franco replied that the Spanish government recognizes Morocco's independence and will certainly respect Morocco's unity.

On the morning of the 7th, a joint statement signed by Moroccan Prime Minister Bekkai and Spanish Foreign Minister Artajo was released. The joint statement said that the Spanish government and the Sultan of Morocco announced that the protectorate system established in 1912 is no longer the basis of relations between the two countries. Spain recognizes "Morocco's independence" and "full sovereignty," including diplomatic autonomy and the right to establish an army. The joint statement expressed that Spain is willing to respect Morocco's territorial integrity, while the freedom and rights of Spaniards in Morocco will be guaranteed.

Attached to the joint statement was a protocol. This protocol stated that the powers of the Spanish authorities in Spanish Morocco will be transferred to the Moroccan government. The Spanish government will assist the Moroccan government in organizing its army; during the transition period, the status of Spanish troops in Spanish Morocco will remain in effect.

    西班牙和摩洛哥发表联合声明宣布摩洛哥独立
    新华社讯　据巴黎报纸报道：西班牙和摩洛哥两国之间关于西属摩洛哥前途问题的谈判已经在四月五日在马德里正式开始举行。摩洛哥苏丹穆罕默德说，这次谈判应该结束摩洛哥的分裂状况。他说，“承认摩洛哥领土在独立的基础上的统一，是毫不违背西班牙国家的利益的。我们准备向住在摩洛哥的西班牙人提供一切必要的保证，但是这无论如何不应当触犯我们的主权。”西班牙元首佛朗哥致答词说，西班牙政府承认摩洛哥的独立，并且一定尊重摩洛哥的统一。
    七日上午发表了由摩洛哥首相贝凯和西班牙外交部长阿塔霍签字的联合声明。联合声明说，西班牙政府和摩洛哥苏丹宣布，1912年建立的保护制度不再是两国关系的基础，西班牙承认“摩洛哥的独立”和“充分的主权”，包括外交自主权和建立军队的权利在内。联合声明表示，西班牙愿意尊重摩洛哥的领土统一，同时，在摩洛哥的西班牙人的自由和权利将得到保证。
    在联合声明后面附有一个议定书。这个议定书说，在西属摩洛哥的西班牙当局的权力将移交给摩洛哥政府。西班牙政府将协助摩洛哥政府组织它的军队；在过渡期间，在西属摩洛哥的西班牙军队的地位仍然有效。
