    Bring Tools to Production Workers
    Now, outside the small window of the tool group in the machine shop of the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, you can no longer see the long lines of workers. This is the result of implementing the method of delivering tools. After implementing this method, at least more than 10,000 work hours spent by production workers on collecting tools can be saved annually.
    In January of this year, young tool operator Zheng Minxue, based on advanced Soviet experience, proposed the suggestion of delivering tools. This method can not only save workers' production time, but also, because the tool operator goes deep into the field, can reasonably allocate new and old tools according to different needs, thereby reducing tool costs.

    把工具送到生产工人身边
    现在，在国营郑州纺织机械厂机工车间工具组的小窗口外，再也看不见工人排成的长队了。这是实行送工具的办法以后的结果。实行这个办法以后，每年至少可以节省生产工人花在领工具上的一万多个工时。
    青年工具员郑敏学在今年一月份，根据苏联先进经验提出了送工具的建议。这个办法不仅能节省工人的生产时间，而且，由于工具员深入现场，还能根据不同需要，合理地调配新旧工具。减少工具费用。（新华社）
