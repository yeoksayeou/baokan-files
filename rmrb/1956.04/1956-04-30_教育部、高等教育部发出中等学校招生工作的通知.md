    The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education jointly issued a notice on secondary school enrollment work for 1956 on April 28.
    The notice stipulates the enrollment methods for this year: Except for junior secondary schools (including junior high schools and elementary normal schools) which will adopt joint enrollment in the same area or individual enrollment by each school, senior secondary schools (including high schools and secondary specialized schools) can generally adopt unified enrollment based on the city or special district as a unit. Enrollment for senior secondary schools must first satisfy the enrollment needs of high schools, and secondly satisfy the enrollment needs of secondary specialized schools. The enrollment work for teacher training crash courses and other departments that need to recruit junior high school graduates will be carried out after the enrollment of high schools and secondary specialized schools.
    The notice requires all regions to do a good job in ideological education and guidance on further education and employment for this year's junior high school graduates, and actively guide previous junior high school graduates and educated youth with junior high school graduation level to apply for senior secondary schools. Where possible, tutoring classes or schools can be set up for them before the exam to help them with their studies. In addition, leadership over self-study organizations should be strengthened.
    The notice stipulates that the dates for secondary school entrance examinations will be decided by each province, city, and autonomous region between July 21 and July 25. Examination subjects: Junior secondary schools will test Chinese language and arithmetic; senior secondary schools will test Chinese language, mathematics, and basic knowledge of politics. Educated youth who apply for senior secondary schools with equivalent qualifications will also be given additional tests in physics and chemistry, biology, and chemistry. (Xinhua News Agency)
