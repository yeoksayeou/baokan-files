Party Organizations Must Strengthen Concrete Leadership in Production
By our reporter Li Lianbin

The first spring plowing season after the realization of agricultural cooperation in Jiangxi Province is about to begin. The broad masses have a high level of enthusiasm for production, and grassroots cadres also have the initiative to lead the masses in production. However, because they have little experience in leading collective production and have fewer methods, many problems cannot be resolved in a timely and correct manner. This urgently requires leadership to give them specific guidance and assistance. What about the leadership? There is still insufficient understanding of this new situation. Either they are satisfied with the achievements already made and relax their leadership over production, or their general style of leadership has not changed, and they are not good at conducting concrete and in-depth work. Therefore, how to make the leadership thinking and leadership style of Party organizations keep up with the needs of the new situation and promote a high tide of agricultural production throughout the province has become one of the central topics of the recent enlarged meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The meeting criticized the erroneous idea of being satisfied with the achievements of cooperation and winter production, and thus relaxing leadership over current production. The meeting believes that the achievements of cooperation throughout the province and the achievements made in the winter production upsurge that followed the cooperation upsurge are indeed great. Before last autumn, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives in the province accounted for only 9.8% of the total number of peasant households. Now, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives in the province accounts for nearly 90% of the total number of peasant households. Last winter, although there was a general lack of rain throughout the province, the winter planting area still exceeded the largest winter planting area in history in 1954 by 30%. Water conservancy winter repair projects and fertilizer accumulation work have also been carried out very well. According to statistics as of February 10, water conservancy winter repair projects have exceeded the original plan by 40%, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated has also exceeded last year's by one time. In the face of such achievements, many cadres have become complacent and relaxed. For example, a member of the Tenth District Committee of Leping County said: "The entire district has achieved cooperation, and the masses have a high level of enthusiasm for production. In the future, leading production only requires holding a meeting to make arrangements." Under the control of the same kind of complacency and slack mood, the Second District of Leping County also relaxed its leadership over production. Sixteen of the 20 district cadres in this district did not understand the current production situation. The meeting pointed out: It is necessary to overcome this complacency and slack mood, and it is necessary to face up to the shortcomings and existing problems in the work. Although cooperation has been realized throughout the province, and the masses have a high level of enthusiasm for production, many cooperatives have not been consolidated, the organization of labor is not sound, and the chaotic phenomenon of "walking like a dragon, working like a swarm of bees" is still relatively common. The production plans in some places have not been placed on a solid and reliable foundation, and the spring plowing preparations in some places have been done very poorly. For example, the Leping County Party Committee inspected the production plans of 152 townships and found that the production plans of 18 townships had very high targets but very few methods. If the potential is not further tapped, the production plans will be difficult to complete. For another example, the Qianyang District Committee of Fenyi County recently inspected ten townships that had done a better job in spring plowing preparation work and found that most of the cooperative labor organizations were lax, agricultural tools had not been repaired, and seeds had not been concentrated. These situations show that complacency is completely unfounded, and relaxing leadership is even more wrong. The achievements now obtained should not be simply compared with the achievements of last year. This comparison has no active significance. The existing achievements should be measured against this year's production plans and increased production tasks. In this way, we can see new tasks and new difficulties, overcome complacency and slack mood, and strengthen leadership.

The meeting focused on criticizing the general leadership style of leading cadres who did not go deep into the grassroots and did not go deep among the masses. The meeting believes that strengthening concrete leadership has become more important and urgent after the realization of cooperation throughout the province. Due to the cooperation upsurge and the production upsurge, new things are constantly emerging in rural areas, and new problems are constantly arising. How should these new things be treated and these new problems be solved? It is not enough to rely solely on grassroots organizations and grassroots cadres. Grassroots cadres still lack the experience to deal with these new things and solve these new problems. The leadership must help them and guide them, set an example for them, and explain the methods to them. This not only specifically solves problems and educates cadres, but also exercises leadership abilities and improves leadership levels. Otherwise, the work cannot be done well, and it will inevitably fall into a passive state. For example, the Fengxin County Party Committee in the previous period was like this. Although the work of this county committee was also hard work and busy work - holding meetings, listening to reports, and issuing instructions - it did not go deep into the cooperatives and did not implement concrete leadership over the most important production work. As a result, after an inspection by the higher authorities, it was found that the winter production and spring plowing preparation work in this county had been done very poorly. As of February 29, the water conservancy project had only completed a little more than 19% of the original plan, and the quality of the project was generally poor. Two-fifths of the rapeseed and wheat fields had not been weeded or topdressed. The county party committee either did not know about these problems, or knew about them but did not solve them concretely. They were merely satisfied with their general leadership.

In order to overcome the general leadership style and ensure the strengthening of concrete leadership, the meeting believes that appropriate systems should be formulated and feasible methods should be proposed. For example, the practice of the Ruijin County Party Committee is relatively good. In order to improve its leadership style, the Ruijin County Party Committee stipulated two methods: 1. Each county party committee member, in addition to being responsible for leading a district and guiding and assisting the work of the district committee, must also directly contact a cooperative to specifically help the cooperative solve problems. 2. Both the county party committee and the district committee must select a cooperative as a key cooperative for obtaining and creating experience. The county party committee must hold a working meeting of the key cooperative once a month to summarize and promote the experience of the key cooperative in a timely manner and guide the work of the entire county.

The meeting finally believes that spring plowing is about to begin, and the tasks are very heavy. In order to ensure the effective transformation of the leadership style and ensure the smooth development of spring plowing production, Party organizations at all levels must effectively streamline meetings and change the abnormal situation in the past where there was a lot of meeting time and little working time, so that more cadres can go deep into the grassroots, understand the situation, and guide the work. In order to enrich the leadership of grassroots organizations and strengthen the work of the county, the size of the district should be reduced and the district organization should be gradually abolished, and the scope of the township should be expanded. All major tasks should be directly assigned by the county party committee to the township branch and the Party organizations of agricultural cooperatives. The meeting also decided that the province should transfer 10,000 full-time cadres for running cooperatives to strengthen the regular and concrete assistance and guidance to cooperatives. At the same time, Party organizations at all levels should strengthen regular inspection work in order to discover and solve problems in a timely manner and discover and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner.

### 党组织要加强对生产的具体领导

    党组织要加强对生产的具体领导
    本报记者　李连斌
    江西全省实现农业合作化以后的第一个春耕生产就要开始，广大群众有很高的生产热情，基层干部也有领导群众生产的积极性。但是，由于他们领导集体生产的经验不多，办法较少，很多问题不能得到及时的正确的解决，这就迫切需要领导上给他们以具体的指导和帮助。而领导上呢？对这种新的情况还认识不足，不是满足于已有的成绩，放松了对生产的领导，就是一般化的领导作风还没有转变，不善于具体深入地进行工作。因此，如何使党组织的领导思想和领导作风赶上新形势的需要，推动全省的农业生产高潮，就成了最近召开的中共江西省委员会扩大会议的中心议题之一。
    会议批判了满足于合作化成绩和冬季生产成绩，因而放松对当前生产领导的错误思想。会议认为，全省合作化的成绩以及随着合作化高潮出现的冬季生产高潮所取得的成绩，的确是很大的。去年秋前，全省入社农户只占总农户的9.8％多，现在，全省入社农户已占总农户近90％。去年冬天，虽然全省普遍缺乏雨水，但冬种面积仍然超过历史上冬种面积最大的1954年的30％。水利岁修工程和积肥的工作也都进行得很好。至二月十日的统计，水利岁修工程已经超过原计划的40％，积肥量也超过了去年的一倍。就在这种成绩面前，不少干部自满松懈起来了。比如乐平县第十区有个区委委员就是这样，他说：“全区已经实现了合作化，群众的生产热情很高，今后领导生产只要开个会布置一下就可以了。”在同样一种自满松懈情绪的支配下，乐平县的第二区也放松了对生产的领导。这个区的二十个区干部中，就有十六个不了解当前的生产情况。会议指出：必须克服这种自满松懈的情绪，必须正视工作中的缺点和存在的问题。全省虽然实现了合作化，群众的生产热情虽然很高，但是不少合作社还没有巩固起来，劳动组织还不健全，“走路一条龙，干活一窠蜂”的混乱现象还比较普遍的存在。有些地方的生产计划还没有放在切实可靠的基础之上，有些地方的春耕准备工作还作得很差。比如乐平县委检查了152个乡的生产计划，就发现有十八个乡的生产计划是指标很高，办法很少，如不继续挖掘潜力，生产计划就很难完成。再比如分宜县钤阳区委最近检查了十个春耕准备工作作得较好的乡，发现大部分合作社劳动组织涣散，农具还未修理，种籽也没集中。这些情况说明，自满是完全没有根据的，放松领导更是错误的。不应该把现在取得的成绩单纯和去年的成绩作比较，这种比较是没有积极意义的。而应该拿今年的生产规划和增产任务来衡量已有的成绩，这样，就能够使我们看到新的任务和新的困难，克服自满松懈情绪，加强领导。
    会议着重批判了领导干部中的不深入下层不深入群众的一般化领导作风。会议认为加强具体领导，在全省合作化以后，有了更大的重要性和迫切性。由于合作化高潮和生产高潮，农村中正在不断出现新事物，不断发生新问题。如何对待这些新事物，解决这些新问题呢？仅仅靠基层组织和基层干部是不行的。基层干部还缺乏处理这种新事物和解决这些新问题的经验。领导上必须去帮助他们和指导他们，给他们做出样子，向他们交代办法。这样不但具体地解决了问题，教育了干部，同时也锻炼了领导的能力，提高了领导的水平。否则就不能把工作作好，就一定会陷于被动。比如前一个时期的奉新县委就是这样，虽然这个县委会的工作也是辛辛苦苦忙忙碌碌的——召开会议，听取汇报，发布指示，但是却没有深入到合作社里去，没有对最重要的生产工作实行具体领导。结果，经过上级一检查，发现这个县的冬季生产和春耕准备工作作得很差。到二月二十九日，水利工程只完成原计划的19％多一点，而且工程质量普遍不好。油菜和小麦田就有五分之二没有锄草和追肥。这些问题，县委或者不知道，或者知道了也没有具体解决。仅仅满足于自己的一般化领导。
    为了克服一般化的领导作风，保证加强具体领导，会议认为，应该规定适当的制度，提出切实可行的办法。比如：瑞金县委的作法就是比较好的。瑞金县委为改进自己的领导作风，规定了这样两个办法：一、每个县委委员除固定分工领导一个区，指导和帮助区委会的工作而外，还要直接联系一个合作社，具体帮助这个合作社解决问题。二、县委和区委都要选择一个合作社作为取得和创造经验的重点社，县委每月要开一次重点社的工作会议，及时总结和推广重点社的经验，指导全县工作。
    会议最后认为，春耕就要开始了，任务十分繁重，为了保证领导作风的切实转变，保证春耕生产的顺利开展，各级党组织必须切实精简会议，改变过去会议时间多，工作时间少的不正常的状况，使得更多的干部能够深入下层，了解情况，指导工作。为了充实基层组织的领导，加强县的工作，应缩减区的编制和逐步取消区的机构，扩大乡的范围。一切重大工作，县委应该直接布置到乡支部和农业合作社的党组织中去。会议还确定全省要抽调一万名办社的专职干部，加强对合作社的经常的具体帮助和指导。同时要各级党组织加强经常的巡视检查工作，以便及时发现和解决问题，及时发现和推广先进经验。
