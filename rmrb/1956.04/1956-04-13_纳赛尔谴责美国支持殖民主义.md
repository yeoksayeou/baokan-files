Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser has accused the United States of expressing support for colonialism, saying that the U.S. made such a declaration to protect its bases abroad.

Nasser made the accusation in an interview with Duncan, a reporter from the American magazine "Life." The latest issue of "Life" magazine published Nasser's conversation.

Nasser said that it seems to many people that fear has caused the United States to materially support colonialism.

Nasser told Duncan that Egypt needed foreign aid after just having undergone a revolution to eliminate the corrupt monarchy. The United States was unable to provide such assistance, despite the fact that: "In your embassy, we gained friendship and understanding... programs were developed, plans were drafted, dreams were made... but nothing happened."

Nasser said, "We asked the Soviet Union for help - the Soviet Union quickly provided assistance almost before the ink on our request was dry - are we now foolish to deal with the communists? We don't think so. The Soviets have made no effort to control us. They deal with us very justly. No secret undertakings, no binding conditions."

    纳赛尔谴责美国支持殖民主义
    新华社12日讯　埃及总理纳赛尔指责美国表示支持殖民主义。他说，美国作出这样的表示是为了保护它在国外的基地。
    纳赛尔是在对美国“生活”杂志记者邓肯发表谈话时提出这种指责的。最近一期的“生活”杂志刊载了纳赛尔的谈话。
    纳赛尔说，对许多人来说，似乎是由于恐惧才使美国在物质上支持殖民主义。
    纳赛尔对邓肯说，埃及刚在进行了扫除腐败的君主政体的革命之后需要外国援助。美国方面没有能够提供这样的援助，尽管事实是：“在你们的大使馆，我们获得了友谊和谅解……方案制定了、计划拟定了，梦也做了……但是什么东西也没有出现”。
    纳赛尔说，“我们要求苏联帮助——苏联几乎在我们的要求书上的墨迹还没有干的时候就迅速地给予了帮助——难道我们现在同共产党人打交道是愚蠢的？我们并不认为这样。苏联人并没有进行任何努力来控制我们。他们同我们很正当地打交道。没有秘密的承担义务，没有条件束缚。”
