Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: The Chinese Academy of Sciences Party Committee held a conference in Beijing today to admit thirty-five researchers and staff members from various research units in the Beijing area into the Party.

    Dai Fanglan, director of the Mycology and Plant Pathology Research Laboratory of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and professor at Beijing Agricultural University, is the most senior of these new Party members. He is one of the founders of plant pathology in China. During the rule of the Kuomintang government, Dai Fanglan taught in many schools in China. He suffered from factional exclusion in the schools and the bullying of imperialist elements, but never succumbed to the forces of darkness. In the difficult times of war, he relied on selling things to make a living, but he never interrupted his scientific research work. After liberation, he received education from the Party. After ideological reform, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and other movements, he moved closer to the Party and understood the Party. This sixty-three-year-old scientist, who came from a poor family, expressed his determination to fight to the end for the cause of communism.

    The famous vertebrate paleontologist Yang Zhongjian has devoted himself to the classification and evolutionary analysis of vertebrate fossils and their relationship to strata for decades. He has made even more important contributions to the study of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. When this nearly sixty-year-old scientist applied to join the Party, he strictly examined his backward thinking, such as not being involved in politics, for a long time.

    Among these new Party members are also Deng Shuqun, a researcher at the Mycology and Plant Pathology Research Laboratory; Zhang Wenyou, deputy director of the Institute of Geology; Zhang Zhaoqian, deputy director of the Institute of Botany; Deng Jiaxian, associate researcher at the Institute of Physics; and Wang Shufen, a female assistant researcher.

    一批科学工作者加入中国共产党
    据新华社21日讯  中共中国科学院机关委员会今天在北京举行大会，接收了北京区各研究单位的三十五个研究人员和工作人员入党。
    中国科学院植物研究所真菌植物病理研究室主任、北京农业大学教授戴芳澜是这批新党员中年资最长的一个，他是中国植物病理学的奠基人之一。在国民党政府统治的年代，戴芳澜曾经在国内不少学校教过书，他遭受过学校里宗派的排挤和帝国主义分子的欺侮，但从不向黑暗势力屈服；他在战争的艰苦时代里，依靠卖东西度日，也从不间断地进行科学研究工作。解放以后，他受到了党的教育；经过了思想改造、抗美援朝等运动以后，他进一步靠近了党，并且认识了党。这位出身于贫苦家庭的六十三岁老科学家表示决心要为共产主义事业奋斗到底。
    著名的古脊椎动物学家杨锺健几十年如一日地致力于古脊椎动物化石的分类、进化分析及其对地层关系的研究。在中生代和新生代的研究方面，他更有重要的贡献。这位年近花甲的老科学家在申请入党的时候，严格地检查了他长期以来不问政治等的落后思想。
    在这批新党员中，还有真菌植物病理研究室研究员邓叔群，地质研究所副所长张文佑，植物研究所副所长张肇骞，物理研究所副研究员邓稼先，女助理研究员王树芬等。
