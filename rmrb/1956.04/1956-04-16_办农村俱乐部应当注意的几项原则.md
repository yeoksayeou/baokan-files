Several Principles to Note When Running Rural Clubs
    Xi Wenju

    Around the Spring Festival of 1956, with the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production, rural cultural work became greatly active, and many rural clubs were established in various places. Most rural clubs implemented the principles of amateurism, voluntarism, small scale, and diverse activities, playing a good role in raising the patriotic and socialist ideological awareness of the broad masses of farmers, inspiring their labor enthusiasm, popularizing cultural and scientific knowledge, and enlivening rural cultural life. Therefore, the practice of believing that rural mass cultural activities will inevitably hinder production, and thus neglecting them, or even crudely restricting, suppressing, and rejecting them, is obviously wrong.

    However, in the process of establishing rural clubs and carrying out rural mass cultural activities, some unhealthy phenomena have also emerged in some places, namely, greed for quantity and speed, extravagance and waste, pursuit of form, and disregard for actual results. For example, some places, regardless of whether objective conditions are already in place, established rural clubs in every agricultural production cooperative in the entire county and district in a very short period of time in the form of a shock campaign (even proposing the slogan of "one day for preparation, two days for shock, and three days for completion!" ). Also, some clubs pay attention to ostentation and "style," some building auditoriums that can accommodate hundreds of people; others purchasing cultural, recreational, and sports equipment worth more than two thousand yuan, while discarding blackboards, broadcasting loudspeakers, and other cultural propaganda tools that have always been effective. For example, the organizational forms and activity methods of rural cultural work in some places do not take into account the characteristics of rural areas and the convenience of farmers, and when primary cooperatives are merged and transformed into advanced cooperatives, all the small-scale clubs originally scattered in various villages are abolished and concentrated at one point to form a large-scale club; or organizing large choirs of thousands of people; or excessively convening rural amateur troupes to hold performances, consuming a lot of manpower and material resources, while farmers get less cultural entertainment. This practice increases the economic burden on farmers, is bound to become detached from the masses, and even hinders production, which is also detrimental to the development of rural cultural work.

    The "Joint Directive on Running Cooperatives Diligently and Frugally" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on April 3, 1956, pointed out: "The cultural and welfare undertakings of cooperatives can only be gradually carried out with the development of production, and some of them should and can be carried out at present (such as temporary nurseries, night schools), and efforts should also be made to be economical, simple, and unadorned. Absolutely not spend a lot of manpower, material resources and financial resources to run cultural and welfare undertakings soon after the establishment of the cooperative." Rural cultural work is part of the entire rural work. It is based on the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production, and should adapt to the overall situation in rural areas and be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner; and it must serve agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production. If we deviate from this foundation and principle, disregard the objective situation in rural areas and the actual needs of farmers, are greedy for quantity and speed, blindly develop, are extravagant and wasteful, and pursue form, then rural cultural work will not be able to exert its due positive role; on the contrary, it will turn a good thing into a bad thing.

    Therefore, in building rural clubs and carrying out rural mass cultural activities, the following principles must be noted:

    1.  Rural clubs must be established and rural cultural work developed in batches and phases in a planned and prepared manner, and do not attempt to complete in a few months or days what needs to be done in a few years. The establishment of clubs should have certain conditions. Generally, they should be established in places where the cooperative is relatively well-established, and they must be based on the voluntariness and needs of the masses. It is inappropriate to propose the slogan of "plays in every village, clubs in every cooperative" now. In places where there are temporarily no conditions to establish rural clubs, we can actively develop various single cultural activity organizations, such as singing teams, amateur troupes, libraries, reading groups, blackboards, slideshow groups, music classes, dance groups, etc. This simple rural cultural activity organization still has a great role to play and should not be underestimated. Even when running rural clubs, the organizational form can be large or small, and the content of activities can be more or less, and there is no need to force uniformity. Moreover, it is advisable to be lean at the beginning, and then gradually develop according to the needs of the masses and subjective strength. For rural clubs that have been established, we should summarize experience, strengthen leadership and assistance, and gradually seek consolidation. The so-called consolidation is not to expand the scale of the club or to make it lively on the surface, but to use the existing manpower and equipment to do something that is beneficial to the physical and mental health of farmers in a way that is appropriate to the time and local conditions, and truly play the role of uniting and educating the masses of farmers.

    2.  Rural mass cultural activities must be combined with agricultural production and other central tasks, adapt to the characteristics of agricultural production, and adhere to the principles of amateurism, voluntarism, small scale, and diversity. The rural club is an organization for farmers to conduct self-education and entertainment in their spare time from production. Its activities must take into account the seasonal characteristics of agricultural production. Generally speaking, in the slack season, activities may be slightly more, and appropriate centralized activities can be carried out; but in the busy season, activities should not be too frequent, and should be carried out more in a decentralized manner with the production team and production group of the cooperative as the unit. It is obviously unreasonable and impossible to require rural clubs to carry out "hot and lively" activities at ordinary times, just like during the Spring Festival. In terms of activity forms, it should be small and diverse, and the traditional methods and skills in local folk cultural activities should be fully utilized and brought into play in order to attract the participation of the broad masses of farmers. Therefore, we should advocate small singing, playing, performing, reading newspapers, and reading books; instead of advocating large-scale chorus, performances and exhibitions.

    3.  Rural clubs should carry out mass cultural activities under the principles of economy and simplicity. The vitality of the club lies in using various methods to attract the broad masses to consciously and voluntarily participate in cultural activities, and to receive education and rest from them. It must not waste the funds of the cooperative, show off, or talk about extravagance. All the work of the club must pay attention to practical results, and do what is within its power, and take into account the ability of farmers to bear the burden. The subscription of newspapers and periodicals should be based on the principle that the masses of farmers really need them, and the types and quantities do not need to be too many. The books in the library should be purchased in batches and gradually, and beneficial books that farmers with low cultural levels can understand should be selected and purchased. Do not blindly purchase a large number of books that cannot be read. Cultural and recreational supplies of the club should encourage the masses of farmers, especially young people, who love activities and have skills to make them themselves as much as possible, and do not buy everything with money. We should advocate the use of simple, easy-to-use, and effective cultural tools, and do not advocate those expensive, complex, and difficult-to-use things. At present, it is generally not advisable for rural clubs to engage in basic construction; only a very few clubs of large and wealthy cooperatives that have been running for many years can do so if they really need it, but it should not cost too much money. In short, rural clubs should spend less money, do more things, and do good things.

    办农村俱乐部应当注意的几项原则
    奚文驹
    1956年春节前后，随着农业合作化运动和农业生产的发展，农村文化工作大为活跃，各地相继建立了许多农村俱乐部。大多数农村俱乐部贯彻执行了业余、自愿、小型、多样的活动方针，在提高广大农民的爱国主义和社会主义思想觉悟，鼓舞农民的劳动热情，普及文化科学知识，活跃农村文化生活上，起了很好的作用。因此，认为农村群众文化活动一定会妨碍生产，因而放任不管，甚至加以粗暴的限制、压抑和排斥的作法，显然是不对的。
    但是，在建立农村俱乐部和开展农村群众文化活动的过程中，某些地方也出现了一些不健康的现象，这就是贪多图快，铺张浪费，追求形式，不问实际效果。例如有的地方不顾是否已经具备客观条件，以突击运动的方式（甚至提出了“一天准备，两天突击，三天完成”的口号！），很短的时间里在全县全区的每个农业生产合作社建立起了农村俱乐部。又如，某些俱乐部讲究排场和“气派”，有的修建了可以容纳几百个人的礼堂；有的购置了价值达二千多元的文化娱乐和体育用品，而将黑板报、广播筒等向来用之有效的文化宣传工具，抛弃不用。又如，某些地方农村文化工作的组织形式和活动方式，不照顾农村的特点和农民的方便，在由初级社合并转成为高级社的时候，将原来分散在各个村庄的小规模的俱乐部一律撤销，集中在某一点成立一个大规模的俱乐部；或者组织上千人的大合唱队；或者过多地召集农村业余剧团举行会演，人力物力消耗很大，而农民所得到的文化娱乐反而不多。这种作法，加重了农民的经济负担，势必脱离群众，甚至妨碍生产，对于农村文化工作的开展也是不利的。
    中共中央和国务院1956年4月3日“关于勤俭办社的联合指示”中指出：“合作社的文化福利事业，只能随着生产的发展逐步举办，有一部分是当前应当举办也可以举办的（例如临时性的托儿站、夜校），也要力求节省、简单朴素。绝不能在合作社成立不久，就耗费大量的人力、物力和财力，来兴办文化福利事业。”农村文化工作是整个农村工作的一部分。它是以农业合作化运动和农业生产为基础的，应当适应农村的全般情况，有计划地有步骤地开展；并且必须为农业合作化和农业生产服务。如果离开了这个基础和原则，不问农村的客观情况和农民的实际需要，贪多图快，盲目发展，铺张浪费，追求形式，那末，农村文化工作就将不能发挥它应有的积极作用，相反地，还会把好事办坏。
    因此，在建设农村俱乐部，开展农村群众文化活动中，必须注意下面几项原则：
    一、必须有计划地有准备地分批分期地建立农村俱乐部和发展农村文化工作，不要企图把几年要办的事情在几个月或几天里办完。建立俱乐部应当有一定条件，一般地要在合作社办得比较有了基础的地方建立，并且必须出于群众的自愿和需要。现在就提出“村村演戏，社社办俱乐部”的口号，是不妥当的。在暂时还没有条件建立农村俱乐部的地方，可以积极地发展多种单一的文化活动组织，像歌咏队、业余剧团、图书室、读报组、黑板报、幻灯组、音乐班、舞蹈组等等。这种简单的农村文化活动组织，仍旧有很大的作用，不应当轻视。就是举办农村俱乐部，组织形式也可大可小，活动内容也可多可少，不必强求一律。而且在初办的时候，以精干一些为宜，以后可以根据群众需要和主观力量，逐步发展。对于已经建立起来的农村俱乐部，应当总结经验，加强领导和帮助，逐渐地求得巩固。所谓巩固，不是将俱乐部规模扩大，或者在表面上搞得轰轰烈烈，而是利用现有的人力和设备，因时制宜，因地制宜，切实作出一些有益于农民身心健康的事情，真正起到团结和教育农民群众的作用。
    二、农村群众文化活动，必须同农业生产和其它中心工作结合，适应农业生产的特点，坚持业余、自愿、小型、多样的方针。农村俱乐部是农民群众在生产余暇时间进行自我教育和娱乐的组织，它的活动必须照顾农业生产的季节性的特点。一般地说，在农闲季节，活动不妨稍多一些，并且可以进行适当的集中活动；但在农忙季节，活动不宜太频繁，并且应当更多地以合作社的生产队、生产组为单位分散地进行活动。要求农村俱乐部在平常的时候，也像春节那样，进行“热火朝天”的活动，显然是不合理也是不可能的。在活动形式方面，应当小型多样，并且应当充分地利用和发挥当地民间文化活动中的传统的方法和技艺，以便吸引广大的农民群众参加。因此，应当提倡小型的歌咏、演奏、表演、读报、读书；而不要去提倡大规模的合唱、演出和展览。
    三、农村俱乐部应当在节约、朴素原则下，开展群众性的文化活动。俱乐部的生命力，在于运用各种方式，吸引广大群众自觉自愿地参加文化活动，并且从中间得到教育和休息。决不应当浪费合作社的资金，摆排场、讲阔气。俱乐部的各项工作必须讲求实效，并且量力而行，切实照顾农民的负担能力。报刊的订阅，以农民群众确实需要为原则，种类和数量不必过多。图书室的图书应当分批地陆续添购，并且应当选购那些文化程度低的农民群众读得懂的有益的图书，不要盲目地购置大批读不了的书。俱乐部文化娱乐用品，应当鼓励爱活动而又有技能的农民群众特别是青年群众尽可能自己制作，不要样样都用钱去买。应当提倡使用那种简便易用、用之有效的文化工具，而不要去提倡那些价格昂贵、复杂难用的东西。在目前，一般农村俱乐部都不宜兴办基本建设；只有极少数办了多年的大的富裕的合作社的俱乐部，确实有此需要，才可以酌量兴办，但也不宜花钱太多。总之，农村俱乐部应当少花钱，多办事，办好事。
