    Inter-Parliamentary Union Council Meeting Concludes
    Soviet Delegation Issues Statement on Admission of China
    Xinhua News Agency, Dubrovnik, 9th – According to TASS, the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council meeting concluded on April 8th. The meeting adopted the reports of various committees, which will be submitted for discussion at the Union's General Assembly in Bangkok in November. The Council passed a resolution calling on parliaments of all countries to urge their governments, especially those participating in the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, to continue to work towards the following goals: to conclude a broad agreement consolidating trust between countries; to significantly reduce armed forces and conventional armaments as a first step towards a comprehensive solution to the disarmament issue; and to ban the manufacture and testing of weapons of mass destruction, prior to which an agreement to cease atomic weapons testing should first be concluded.

    The focus of attention at this Council meeting was the issue of admitting the delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. As is known, this issue was decided affirmatively at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Delhi last year. According to the current regulations and existing procedures and practices of the Union, it is only necessary for the Executive Committee to notify the Council of its decision for the record. For example, the Council did just that at this meeting regarding the admission of the Peruvian delegation to the Union.

    However, the issue of admitting the delegation of the People's Republic of China was not resolved in this way. The representative of Thailand requested that the Executive Committee's decision on admitting the Chinese delegation be discussed only after the issue of China's representation in the United Nations has been resolved. On the other hand, the Polish representative suggested that, in accordance with the Union's charter, rules of procedure, and practices, the Executive Committee's decision should be recorded without discussion on the issue. The Chairman of the Council meeting, Pisanelli (Italy), grossly violated the charter and rules of procedure and declared that those voting against the Polish proposal would automatically be considered as voting in favor of the Thai proposal. In the vote on the 7th, the Polish proposal was rejected by a majority vote.

    During the discussion, the Soviet representatives Mikhailov and Paletskis steadfastly defended the legitimate and inalienable right of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Union. They emphasized that the issue of admitting the Chinese delegation had already been resolved, and Lord Stansgate, the President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, had repeatedly pointed out that the issue could only be resolved in a different manner if the charter and existing procedures were amended.

    The statements of the Soviet representatives received active support from representatives of parliamentary delegations from many countries, including India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and some countries in Scandinavia.

    The Council's decision sparked widespread discussion among parliamentary delegations and journalists. Many representatives emphasized that this decision regarding the People's Republic of China was completely undemocratic, illegal, and unjust.

    The Soviet representative Paletskis proposed reconsidering the issue of the People's Republic of China at the morning meeting on the 8th. The Chairman of the meeting, Pisanelli, rejected this proposal. The Soviet representative Mikhailov then stated that the Soviet delegation considered the admission of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union to be a very important issue, and therefore it submitted a written statement to the Council.

    The Soviet delegation's statement said that the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, after a comprehensive and lengthy discussion in Delhi, decided that the delegation of the People's Republic of China met all the requirements of the Union's charter, and decided that the Executive Committee would report this matter to the Council. According to the current charter, this is the only legal and correct decision. Any other decision that violates the Union's democratic decision would be a gross violation of the Union's charter.

    The statement said that the People's Republic of China has made significant contributions to the cause of peace, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal and fully empowered representative of the Chinese people recognized by many countries and international organizations. Any discrimination against the delegation of the People's Republic of China is intolerable. Delaying the resolution of the issue of admitting the delegation of the People's Republic of China can only damage the credibility of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in the eyes of world public opinion.

    The statement concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation firmly demands the democratic implementation of the decision made by the Executive Committee in Delhi, which has not been revoked by anyone, and cannot be revoked by the Council.

### 各国议会联盟理事会会议闭幕  苏联议员团就接纳中国问题发表声明

    各国议会联盟理事会会议闭幕
    苏联议员团就接纳中国问题发表声明
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社杜布罗夫尼克讯：各国议会联盟理事会会议四月八日闭幕。会议通过了各委员会的报告，这些报告将在十一月在曼谷举行的联盟大会上提出讨论。理事会通过决议，号召世界各国的议会要求本国政府，特别是那些参加联合国裁军小组委员会的政府，继续为达到下列目的而努力：缔结一个巩固各国之间的信任的广泛协议；大大地裁减武装力量和常规军备，作为全面解决裁军问题的第一步；禁止制造和试验大规模的杀人武器，在此以前应当首先缔结停止试验原子武器的协议。
    这次理事会会议的注意中心是关于接纳中华人民共和国议员团参加各国议会联盟问题。大家知道，这个问题在去年在德里举行的各国议会联盟执行委员会会议上曾经作了肯定的决定。根据现行的章程和现有的程序和联盟的惯例，只要执行委员会把它的决定通知理事会备案就可以了。例如，理事会在这次会议中对于接纳秘鲁议员团参加联盟就是这样。
    然而，关于接纳中华人民共和国议员团的问题却没有如此解决。泰国的代表要求等到中国在联合国内的代表权问题得到解决之后再讨论执行委员会关于接纳中国议员团的决定。另一方面，波兰代表根据联盟的章程、议事规则和惯例建议把执行委员会的决定备案，不必就这个问题展开讨论。理事会会议主席皮桑奈利（意大利）粗暴地违反章程和议事规则，宣布投票反对波兰建议的就自动作为投票赞成泰国的建议。七日会议上投票结果，波兰建议被多数票否决。
    在讨论过程中，苏联代表米哈伊洛夫和帕列茨基斯坚定不移地捍卫中华人民共和国参加联盟的合法的、不可剥夺的权利。他们着重指出，关于接纳中国议员团的问题已经获得解决，各国议会联盟主席斯坦斯盖特勋爵曾经屡次指出，只有在修改章程和现有程序的时候才能按其他方式解决问题。
    苏联代表的发言得到许多国家议员团代表的积极支持，其中包括印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、南斯拉夫和斯堪的那维亚半岛上的一些国家。
    理事会的决定使各国议员团和记者议论纷纷。许多代表着重指出，对中华人民共和国作出的这种决定完全是不民主的、不合法的和不公正的。
    苏联代表帕列茨基斯在八日上午会议上提出重新讨论关于中华人民共和国问题的建议。会议主席皮桑奈利拒绝了这一建议。苏联代表米哈伊洛夫接着说，苏联代表团认为接纳中华人民共和国议员团参加各国议会联盟是一个十分重要的问题，因此它向理事会提出一项书面声明。
    苏联议员团的声明说，各国议会联盟执行委员会在德里经过全面的和长时间的讨论后做出决定，认为中华人民共和国议员团符合本联盟章程的所有要求，并决定由执行委员会将这件事报告理事会。根据现行的章程，这是唯一合法和正确的决定。如果违反联盟的民主决定而做出任何其他决定，那都是对联盟章程的粗暴破坏。
    声明说，中华人民共和国对和平事业做出重大贡献，中华人民共和国政府是许多国家和国际组织所承认的中国人民的唯一合法的全权代表。对中华人民共和国议员团的任何歧视都是不能容忍的。拖延关于接纳中华人民共和国议员团问题的解决只能在世界舆论面前使各国议会联盟的威信遭受损失。
    声明最后说，苏联议员团坚决要求民主地贯彻执行委员会在德里所做出的决定，这个决定谁也没有撤销，理事会也是不能撤销的。
