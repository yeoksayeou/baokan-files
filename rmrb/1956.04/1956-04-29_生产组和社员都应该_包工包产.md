Production Teams and Members Should Both "Contract for Work and Output"
    He Cheng
    Some agricultural production cooperatives in the Wuhu area of Anhui Province have implemented the method of "production teams contracting for work and output with the management committee, and production groups contracting for work and output with the production team." They believe that if only the production team contracts for work and output with the management committee, and the production group only contracts for work but not output, it cannot meet the needs of production development. Some production groups, after completing the work according to the contract, no longer care about anything else, ignoring livestock trampling crops, the quality of seedlings, or the size of the harvest. One production team leader said: If only the production team contracts for work and output, and the production group does not, then I, the team leader, become a lone wolf, unable to control anyone, and the entire team cannot be of one mind; in this way, the production team's contracted output cannot be achieved.
    Many agricultural production cooperatives in the Jiangjin area of Sichuan Province contract for work and output down to each member household. The production group contracts for a certain amount of land, a certain amount of output, and a certain amount of cost, and then distributes it to each member household in the group to be responsible for. They believe that only in this way can the production responsibility system be thoroughly implemented; and only in this way can the completion of the entire cooperative's production plan be better guaranteed.
    Assigning output tasks to production groups and each member is entirely correct. Some agricultural production cooperatives (mainly advanced cooperatives) only have production teams contracting for work and output, while production groups and members do not, which creates the problem that members only care about earning work points and do not care about the cooperative's production. This is an important reason why production is still chaotic in many agricultural production cooperatives that have established labor organizations and implemented contracting for work and output.
    Some people say that assigning certain plots of land and certain amounts of output to production groups and each member will hinder the advantages of unified management and collective labor. This statement is incorrect. Production teams can adopt different methods to allow production groups and each member to contract for work and output, according to the specific circumstances of different crop types, different agricultural tools used, different natural conditions, and different technical levels of members. Crops that require less labor and are grown in large areas can be the responsibility of the entire team and not be divided among the production groups. Crops that require more refined field management and harvesting work can be divided into plots of land and assigned to each production group, or even to each member to be responsible for. The plowing and sowing work for these crops, which is inconvenient or even impossible for production groups and members to be responsible for, can still be the responsibility of the entire team, while the production groups and members responsible for certain tasks on each plot of land supervise and inspect the quality of plowing and sowing work on each plot. The harvesting work of some crops is also not suitable for each member to do; individuals can be responsible for field management, while the harvesting work is the responsibility of the production group or production team.
    The members of the production group responsible for a certain plot of land and a certain crop should be as fixed as possible to strengthen their sense of responsibility and increase crop yields. However, this does not mean that the production group or member is not responsible for work other than the specific work on this plot. For temporary production needs, the entire production team can, under the principle of overall planning and consideration, transfer personnel to form temporary special production groups. During the relatively slack farming season, the management committee can also, to meet the needs of sideline production, transfer certain personnel from each production group to form short-term sideline production groups. Each production team does not need to assign every member of the team to each production group; there can be some personnel who specialize in team-wide work and mobile personnel.
    Assigning production groups or members to be responsible for certain tasks on certain plots of land does not mean that the production group or member can plant whatever they want or do whatever they want on this plot. They should carry out work according to the unified production plan and technical measures of the entire cooperative and the entire team, and on this basis, give full play to their initiative and creativity. Production groups and members can bear a certain responsibility for the harvest of certain crops on this certain plot of land according to the actual situation (a certain proportion can be agreed upon by all members; for example, the entire team is responsible for 20%, the production group is responsible for 30%, and the members are responsible for 50%), and do not necessarily have to bear full responsibility.
    To strengthen the production responsibility of members and give full play to the advantages of collective labor, leaders of various localities and cooperatives need to come up with many flexible methods based on specific circumstances. If these two aspects are handled well, there will be no conflict. It is important to encourage members through the system and care about the final results of labor from the perspective of personal material interests. However, we must not neglect to strengthen collectivist education, and make members deeply aware of and always remember that collective interests are consistent with individual interests. Assigning certain plots of land will enable members to better take responsibility for the plots they are responsible for; however, they should also care about the plots that others are responsible for. For example, if a member sees livestock running into a plot of land that another member is responsible for and that member happens to be away, the member should consciously take responsibility for driving them away, rather than adopting the attitude of "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs."

### 生产组和社员都应该“包工包产”

    生产组和社员都应该“包工包产”
    何成
    安徽芜湖地区有的农业生产合作社实行了“生产队向管委会包工包产，生产组向生产队包工包产”的办法。他们认为：如果只是生产队向管委会包工包产而生产组只包工不包产，不能适应生产发展的需要。有的生产组按照包工的规定完成了工作，就什么都不管了，牲口糟踏庄稼不管，青苗长得好不好不管，庄稼收多收少不管。有一个生产队长说：光是生产队包工包产，生产组不包产，我这队长就成了一条光杆，抓不住人，全队不能一条心；这样，生产队包了产也没法实现。
    四川江津地区许多农业生产合作社把包工包产包到了每户社员。生产组承包了一定的土地和一定的产量、一定的成本，又把它分给组里各户社员负责。他们认为：只有这样，才可以把生产责任制贯彻执行到底；也只有这样，才可以使全社的生产计划的完成更有保证。
    把一定产量的任务包给生产组和每个社员，是完全对的。有些农业生产合作社（主要是高级社）只有生产队包工包产，生产组和社员不包工包产，这就产生了问题，就是社员只顾赚工分，不关心社里的生产。这是目前许多农业生产合作社建立了劳动组织，实行了包工包产，生产仍然混乱的一个重要原因。
    有人说：生产队把一定的地段，一定的产量包给生产组和每个社员，会妨碍发挥统一经营、集体劳动的优越性。这种说法是不对的。生产队可以按照农作物种类的不同、使用的农具的不同、自然条件的不同、社员技术水平的不同等等具体情况，采取各不相同的办法让生产组和每个社员包工包产。费人工比较少而且连成大片的作物，可以由全队负责，不再分给各生产组。需要比较精细地进行田间管理和收获工作的作物，可以划分地段分给各生产组负责，甚至可以分给每个社员负责。这种作物的耕地、播种工作由生产组和社员负责，是不方便甚至是不可能的，仍可以由全队负责，而由负责各个地段上的一定工作的生产组和社员监督，检查各个地段上耕地和播种工作的质量。有些作物的收获工作也不适宜由每个社员来做，可以由个人负责田间管理工作，收获工作则由生产组或生产队负责。
    这种负责一定地段一定作物的生产组的成员应该尽可能地固定，以便加强责任心和提高作物的产量。但是，这并不是说除了这个地段的一定工作以外的工作，这个生产组或社员就都可以不负责任了。全生产队为临时的生产需要，可以在统筹兼顾的原则下，抽调人员编制临时的特殊的生产小组。在农事比较闲的时候，管理委员会也可以适应副业生产的需要，抽调各生产组的一定人员编制短期的副业生产小组。各个生产队也不必把全队每一个人都划到各个生产组去，可以有一些专做全队工作的人员和机动人员。
    划分给生产组或社员负责一定的地段上的一定的工作，并不是说生产组或社员就可以随便在这个地段想种什么就种什么、想怎么做就怎么做，而应当按照全社全队统一的生产计划和技术措施来进行工作，在这样的基础上充分发挥积极性和创造性。生产组和社员对于这一定地段上的一定的作物的收成，可以按照实际情况负一定的责任（可以由全体社员议定一定的比例。比如：全队负责20％，生产组负责30％，社员负责50％），不一定要负全部的责任。
    既要加强社员的生产责任心，又要充分发挥集体劳动的优越性，需要各地各社的领导人员根据具体情况想出许多灵活的办法。这两个方面处理得好就不会发生矛盾。还要注意到：从制度上鼓励社员，从个人物质利益上关心劳动的最后成果，当然是很重要的；但是，也不可忽视加强集体主义教育，要使社员深刻地认识到并且时时刻刻地记得：集体利益同个人利益是一致的。分了一定的地段，会使社员对自己负责的地段更好地负起责任来；可是，对于别人负责的地段也应同样关心。比如，一个社员看到牲口跑到别人负责的地段而别人又恰好不在地里，这个社员就应该自觉地负责把它赶走，而不应该采取“各人自扫门前雪，不管人家瓦上霜”的态度。
