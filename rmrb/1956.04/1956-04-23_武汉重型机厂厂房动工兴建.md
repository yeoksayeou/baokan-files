Construction Begins on Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant Workshops

The workshop project for the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant officially broke ground on the 20th, one month ahead of the original schedule.

The land leveling work for this factory area began in September of last year. At present, the power supply and water supply projects have been basically completed, and the railway, factory area roads, and drainage pipeline projects are underway. Eight temporary processing factories for large-scale construction have also been largely built. Other projects, such as warehouses, office buildings, a technical school, and dormitory buildings for the workers' village, are under intensive construction.

After completion, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant will be a highly automated factory capable of producing various high-performance and versatile machine tools.

    武汉重型机厂厂房动工兴建
    武汉重型工具机厂厂房工程，较原计划提前一个月在二十日正式破土开工。
    这个工厂的厂区平土工程是去年九月开始施工的。目前，供电、给水工程已经基本完成，铁路、厂区道路和排水管道工程正在进行，八个供大规模施工用的临时加工工厂也大都建设起来。其他的一些工程，如仓库、办公楼、技工学校和工人村的宿舍等，都正在紧张地进行施工。
    武汉重型工具机厂建成后，将是一座高度自动化的工厂，它能生产多种性能优良、用途广泛的机床。
