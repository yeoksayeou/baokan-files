Gansu is launching a province-wide campaign to build a "Great Green Wall" in the Hexi Corridor region of Gansu Province.

This spring, approximately 800,000 mu of protective forests will be planted along the 1,200-kilometer-long sand control line in the corridor, stretching from Wushaoling in the east to Dunhuang in the west. Currently, along the banks of many inland rivers, such as the Shule River, Heihe River, and Huangyang River, and in the groves near villages, people are climbing tall mother trees to cut branches for planting every morning and evening. During the day, dark crowds are digging tree pits in barren lands and beaches covered with weeds and gravel. The sound of clanging tools echoes across the barren beaches of the corridor.

Farmers in Yumen, Anxi, Dunhuang, and other counties west of Jiayuguan are braving the wind and sand to plant trees. The women of Jiuquan City have also proposed creating a "Women's Ring Forest" more than ten li long around the city. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    甘肃展开营造“万里绿长城”活动
    甘肃省河西走廊地区营造我国北部“万里绿长城”的活动全面展开。
    今年春天，这个走廊东起乌鞘岭西至敦煌一千二百多公里的防沙线上，将要营造起八十万亩左右的防护林。现在，在走廊上的疏勒河、黑河、黄羊河等许多内陆河流两岸和村庄附近的丛林里，每天清晨和夜晚都有人爬上高大的母树砍树栽；白天，一片片长满杂草和堆着碎石的荒地和沙滩上，有黑压压的人群挖着树窝。走廊里的荒滩上响起一片铿锵的声音。
    走廊西部嘉峪关外的玉门、安西、敦煌等县的农民们，冒着风沙进行植树活动。酒泉市妇女还提出要在市周围营造一个长达十多华里的“环城妇女林”。　（据新华社讯）
