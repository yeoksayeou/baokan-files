    Introduction to the World Federation of Scientific Workers
    The World Federation of Scientific Workers is holding its 16th Executive Council meeting in Beijing starting today, and will also hold a celebration大会 [dà huì - grand meeting, celebration] to mark the tenth anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Scientific Workers after the meeting. This is a major event in the lives of scientific workers around the world.
    The World Federation of Scientific Workers was initiated by the British Association of Scientific Workers and other organizations and was established in London in July 1946. It currently has sixteen scientific workers' organizations from fourteen countries, including Britain, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, India, Japan, Pakistan, Poland, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The number of members has grown to over 150,000. The China Association for Science and Technology is one of its member organizations.
    The highest body of the association is the General Assembly. The leading body during the adjournment of the General Assembly is the Executive Council. During the adjournment of the Executive Council, the affairs of the association are handled by the Executive Bureau. The president of the association is Professor Joliot-Curie of France, and the vice-presidents are Professor Bernal of Britain, Professor Powell of Britain, Professor Li Siguang of China, Academician Oparin of the Soviet Union, and Professor Pauling of the United States. Professor Powell is also the chairman of the Executive Council. The Secretary-General is Dr. البيجا [bǐ jiā - Beiga] of France. The headquarters are located in London. There is an office in Paris. The East European Regional Center of the World Federation of Scientific Workers was established in Prague in the spring of 1953 to be responsible for liaison with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Since April 1953, the members' publication "Communication" has been published in English in London, in Russian in Prague, and in Chinese in Beijing, reporting on the activities of various member organizations and strengthening contact and cooperation among member organizations.
    The purpose of the World Federation of Scientific Workers is to create an effective world organization to promote understanding and cooperation among member organizations, to strive for the full use of science to promote peace and enhance human welfare, to promote international cooperation in science and technology, to oppose war, and to oppose the misuse of scientific achievements. The "Charter for Scientific Workers," adopted at the first General Assembly in 1948, pointed out that the responsibilities of scientific workers to the world are: to maintain the internationality of science, to investigate the basic causes of war, to support all measures to prevent war and establish a solid foundation for peace, to oppose the distortion of scientific achievements as preparations for war, especially to oppose the use of science as a tool for mass slaughter, and scientific workers have a responsibility to maintain the authenticity of scientific work, to protest against the distortion or control of scientific knowledge, and to fully develop the achievements of scientific research.
    The World Federation of Scientific Workers is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year since its establishment. Over the past ten years, the World Federation of Scientific Workers has united peace-loving and just scientists and has made great efforts and achieved remarkable achievements in defending peace and striving for science to serve human happiness. The first General Assembly held in Prague in 1948 adopted the "Charter for Scientific Workers." The resolution of the congress: condemned war propaganda, opposed the use of atomic energy for war; opposed racial discrimination, colonial policies, and interference in the internal affairs of other countries; and protested against the persecution of progressive scientists by the reactionaries in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of China, Greece, Argentina, and other countries. The Second General Assembly in 1951 unanimously passed a resolution opposing atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and bacteriological weapons, recommending that the Executive Council be responsible for convening an international scientific conference to discuss the current use of science and how science should be used, as well as other issues related to world peace and happiness; and recommended that the Executive Council strive to promote the exchange of scientific knowledge and international visits by scientists from various countries. The 11th Executive Council in 1952 passed a resolution calling on scientists from all countries to strive for normal cultural exchanges, and heard and discussed the report by Professor Tu Changwang, the Chinese representative, on protesting against the use of bacteriological weapons by the US military in Korea and China. The Executive Council instructed the association's president, Joliot-Curie, to issue a notice to the association's branches in various countries, calling on them to oppose bacteriological warfare, and recommended that the United Nations pass a resolution condemning the use of bacteriological weapons. The Third General Assembly was held in Budapest in September 1953, and its central task was to consolidate and expand the unity of scientific workers around the world in order to achieve the goals of the World Federation of Scientific Workers. Three declarations were unanimously adopted at the meeting: the first declaration clearly pointed out that scientific workers should devote themselves to the work of easing international tensions and promoting arms reduction; the second declaration called for the prohibition of atomic weapons, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons; and the third declaration declared opposition to restricting academic freedom, opposing endangering scientific human rights, advocating expanding the mass character of science, and strengthening international cultural exchanges. The unanimous adoption of the various resolutions and the three declarations of this大会 [dà huì - grand meeting, celebration] demonstrated the unprecedented unity of the hundreds of thousands of scientific workers represented by the World Federation of Scientific Workers. The achievements of the大会 [dà huì - grand meeting, celebration] laid a good foundation for the further development of the World Federation of Scientific Workers.
    The Fourth General Assembly was held in Berlin in September 1955, and decided to prepare for the convening of an international scientific conference to discuss cooperation among scientists from various countries and the issue of opposing the use of atomic weapons, and the meeting also passed a resolution on international scientific cooperation.
    At the Executive Bureau meeting held in London in early December 1955, the invitation of the China Association for Science and Technology was accepted, and it was decided to hold the 16th Executive Council meeting and the celebration大会 [dà huì - grand meeting, celebration] of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Scientific Workers in Beijing from April 1 to 3, 1956.

    世界科学工作者协会介绍
    世界科学工作者协会今日起在北京举行第十六届执行理事会议，会后并将举行世界科协成立十周年庆祝大会。这是世界科学工作者生活中的一个重大的事情。
    世界科学工作者协会是由英国科学工作者协会等团体发起，于1946年7月在伦敦成立的。现有团体会员为英国、保加利亚、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦、法国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、印度、日本、巴基斯坦、波兰、美国、苏联等十四个国家的十六个科学工作者组织。会员人数已发展到十五万人以上。中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会是它的会员团体之一。
    协会的最高组织为代表大会。大会休会后的领导机构是执行理事会。执行理事会休会期间，会务由执行局处理。协会主席为法国约里奥—居里教授，副主席为英国贝尔纳教授、英国鲍威尔教授、中国李四光教授、苏联奥巴林院士、美国包林教授。鲍威尔教授并为执行理事会主席。秘书长为法国毕加博士。会址设在伦敦。巴黎设有办事处。 1953年春在布拉格成立世界科协东欧区域中心，负责与苏联及东欧各国联系工作。1953年4月起在伦敦出版会员刊物“通讯”英文版，布拉格出俄文版，在北京出中文版，报道各会员团体的活动，加强会员组织之间的联系与合作。
    世界科协成立的目的是创立一个有效的世界性的机构，以促进会员团体之间的了解和合作，为充分利用科学来促进和平和增进人类福利、为促进科学和技术上的国际合作而努力，反对战争，反对妄用科学成果。在1948年首届代表大会中通过的
  “科学工作者宪章”中，指出科学工作者对世界的责任是：保持科学的国际性，追究战争的基本原因，支持一切防止战争和建立稳固的和平基础的措施，反对歪曲科学的成果作为战争的准备，特别是反对利用科学作大规模屠杀工具，科学工作者有责任保持科学工作的真实性，抗议对科学知识的歪曲或控制，充分发展科学研究的成果。
    世界科协自成立以来，今年恰为十周年。十年来，世界科协团结爱好和平的和正义的科学家，为保卫和平、争取科学服务于人类幸福作了巨大的努力，并获得卓越的成就。1948年在布拉格举行的首届代表大会，通过了“科学工作者宪章”。大会决议：谴责战争宣传，反对原子能用于战争；反对种族歧视、殖民政策和干涉他国内政；对中国国民党统治区、希腊、阿根廷及其它国家的反动派迫害进步科学家表示抗议。1951年第二届代表大会一致通过了反对原子弹、氢弹、细菌武器的决议，建议执行理事会负责召集国际科学会议，讨论科学在目前的使用情况及科学应如何使用以及其它有关世界和平和幸福的问题；并建议执行理事会努力促进国际间科学知识的交流和各国科学家国际间的访问。1952年的第十一届执行理事会通过了号召各国科学家争取正常文化交流的决议，并听取和讨论了中国代表涂长望教授关于抗议美军在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的报告。执行理事会责成协会主席约里奥—居里向协会各国分会发出通告，号召他们反对细菌战，并建议联合国通过一项决议来谴责使用细菌武器。1953年9月在布达佩斯举行第三届代表大会，它的中心任务是巩固和扩大世界科学工作者的团结，以实现世界科协的奋斗目标。会上一致通过了三个宣言：第一个宣言中明确指出科学工作者应致力于缓和国际紧张局势的工作，促成缩减军备；第二个宣言要求禁止原子武器、化学武器和细菌武器；第三个宣言声明反对限制学术自由，反对危害科学人权，主张扩大科学的群众性，加强国际文化交流。这次大会的各项决议和三个宣言的一致通过，显示了世界科协所代表的十几万科学工作者的空前的团结一致。大会的成就为世界科协奠定了进一步发展的良好基础。
    1955年9月在柏林举行了第四届代表大会，决定筹备召开国际科学会议来讨论世界各国科学家间的合作和反对使用原子武器问题，会议并通过了关于国际科学合作的决议。
    1955年12月初在伦敦举行的执行局会议上，接受了中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会的邀请，决定于1956年4月1—3日在北京举行第十六届执行理事会议和世界科协成立十周年纪念会。
