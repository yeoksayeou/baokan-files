Promote Agricultural Technology Reform

Reform Spring Sowing Techniques

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: During the spring plowing and sowing season, members of agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong Province are launching an agricultural technology reform movement under the guidance of more than 224,000 agricultural technicians within the cooperatives.

In Liaocheng and Huimin prefectures, major cotton-producing areas, over 80% of cotton seeds in agricultural cooperatives have undergone meticulous selection, and advanced techniques such as seed dressing with pesticides, seed soaking, and vernalization of cotton seeds are widely adopted. Agricultural cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas also clear weeds and insect eggs around cotton fields in advance, and burn dry bolls and rotten cotton on cotton stalks to eliminate overwintering pests such as cotton aphids.

In Laiyang, Changwei prefectures and the Yimeng mountainous area, more than 81,000 technicians from agricultural cooperatives, over 90% of whom have mastered the techniques of sweet potato warm bed seedling cultivation, peanut rhizobium inoculation, corn hybridization, and artificial pollination, are now in the process of putting most of the spring-sown sweet potato seeds onto heated beds for seedling cultivation. Agricultural cooperatives in the main peanut-producing areas such as Laiyang and four other prefectures have purchased more than 526,000 bottles of peanut rhizobium, which can be used to inoculate more than 5,261,000 mu of peanuts. This item alone can increase the production of peanuts by more than 10 million jin.

Change Farming Methods

Our correspondent in Nanchang reports: Jiangxi Province is actively promoting the "Three Changes" measures: transforming one season into two seasons, dry land into paddy fields, and barren land into cultivated land. According to incomplete statistics from the Gannan Administrative Office and five prefectures, including Shangrao and Nanchang, as of April 12, the total area of "Three Changes" reached more than 4.6 million mu, an increase of two times compared to last year.

Leadership at all levels attaches great importance to the "Three Changes" measures. The Gaoan County Party Committee organized seven county committee members and more than 100 cadres to conduct in-depth inspections of the implementation of the "Three Changes" plan. Hukou County launched a week-long technical training program on double-cropping rice throughout the county.

Improve Low-Yielding Field Soil

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Members of agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province are carrying out soil improvement activities on low-yielding fields. More than one million mu of low-yielding field soil in more than ten counties, including Shaoyang, Hengyang, and Yuanjiang, have been improved.

In the Dongting Lake area, members of agricultural cooperatives are controlling "shifting sand" fields. They transport silt from ditches and harbors to sandy fields by small boats. In hilly areas, members are advancing on "fanqiu" fields. Due to poor soil and other reasons, seedlings turn yellow after being planted in this type of field, and are not easily revived, generally yielding only more than 200 jin per mu. Now, members are taking different measures to control it according to different conditions: applying more fertilizer to barren fields; mixing sand into heavy clay fields; and draining water from cold, waterlogged fields to prevent cold water from harming the seedlings. In Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, where the soil is relatively poor, Miao and Han farmers plan to improve all of the county's more than 8,000 mu of low-yielding fields into good fields this year, and it is expected to increase grain production by at least two million jin.

Implement Frequent and Shallow Irrigation

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Several irrigation reforms are being promoted in the irrigation area of the Yellow River Plain in northern Gansu Province.

More than 700 agricultural production cooperatives in the irrigation area are actively merging the spiderweb-like branch canals, bucket canals, and capillary canals, opening up old ridges, building temporary small furrow ridges, and adjusting the planting area to plant similar crops together, in order to implement the method of frequent and shallow irrigation of small furrows. The cooperatives are also preparing to make irrigation quotas according to the planting area and different water requirements of various crops, and implement unified planned water allocation.

In order to save water and increase grain production, 50% of the total planting area of crops such as wheat, millet, and foxtail millet on the plain, and all of the newly reclaimed and planted fields, will implement the method of frequent and shallow irrigation of small furrows this year.

    推行农业技术改革
    改革春播技术
    在春耕播种的季节里，山东省农业生产合作社的社员们，在社内二十二万四千多名农业技术员的指导下展开了农业技术改革运动。
    主要产棉地区聊城和惠民专区的农业社，80％以上的棉种都进行了精选，并且普遍采用了药剂拌种、闷种和棉种春化处理的先进技术。各产棉区的农业社还提前清除棉田周围的杂草和虫卵，烧掉棉秸上的干桃、烂铃，以消灭越冬的棉蚜等害虫。
    莱阳、昌潍专区和沂蒙山区农业社的八万一千多名技术员，90％以上都掌握了甘薯温床育苗、花生根瘤菌拌种、玉米杂交和人工辅助授粉的技术，现在这些地区的春种甘薯种大部分已经上炕育苗。花生主要产地莱阳等四个专区的农业社，已购买花生根瘤菌五十二万六千多瓶，可供五百二十六万一千多亩花生拌种使用。仅这一项就可增产花生果一千多万斤。

    改变耕作方法
    江西省各地正在积极推行一季变两季、旱地变水田、荒地变熟地的“三变”措施。据赣南行署和上饶、南昌等五个专区到四月十二日不完全统计，“三变”总面积达四百六十多万亩，比去年增加二倍。
    各级领导机关对“三变”措施都很重视。高安县委组织了七名县委委员和一百多个干部，分头深入检查“三变”计划贯彻执行情况。湖口县在全县范围内开展了一个双季稻技术传授周。（本报驻南昌记者）
    改良低产田土壤
    湖南省各地农业生产合作社的社员们正在低产田上进行改良土壤的活动。邵阳、衡阳、沅江等十多个县目前已经有一百多万亩低产田的土壤得到改良。
    在洞庭湖滨，农业社的社员们正在制服“走沙”田。他们把沟港里的淤泥，用小划子一船船地送到沙田里。在丘陵地区，社员们正向“翻秋”田进军。这种田由于田底子贫瘠和其他原因，禾苗插下后发黄，不易转青，一般每亩产量只有两百多斤。现在社员们正在根据不同情况采取不同办法治服它：贫瘠的田多施肥料；粘性重的夹泥田掺沙进去；冷浸水田就开沟沥水，不让冷浸水侵害禾苗。土质比较贫瘠的湘西苗族自治州吉首县，苗、汉族农民今年要把全县八千多亩低产田全部改良为好田，预计至少能增产两百万斤稻谷。（据新华社讯）
    实行勤灌和浅灌
    甘肃省北部黄河平原灌溉区正在推行几项灌溉改革。
    灌溉区内七百多个农业生产合作社积极合并密如蛛网的支渠、斗渠和毛渠，把老埂打通，修筑临时性的小畦埂，并且调整播种面积，使同类作物播种在一片，以便实行小畦勤灌、浅灌的方法。各社还准备按照各种作物的播种面积和不同的需水量作出灌水定额，实行统一的计划配水。
    为了节约用水，增产粮食，今年平原上小麦、糜子、谷子等作物播种总面积的50％和新开垦播种的全部田地将实行小畦勤灌、浅灌的方法。　（据新华社讯）
