    新华社16日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：大家已经知道，苏日伦敦谈判日本方面的全权代表松本俊一受本国政府的委托在今年三月二十三日曾经转给苏联驻英国大使马立克一项声明，说日本政府愿意立刻开始关于保护鱼源和援助海上失事船只问题的谈判。
    松本俊一说，如果苏联政府表示赞同，那么可委托两国渔业管理机构的专家们在伦敦或者在莫斯科进行谈判。
    为此，马立克在四月九日向日本驻英国大使西春彦作了声明，请他转达日本政府，苏联政府在仔细地研究了三月二十三日转达的日本政府的建议之后，同意就上述问题开始谈判。
    关于进行谈判的地点问题，在声明中指出，苏联政府认为谈判最好在东京或者在莫斯科举行。
    同时还向日本大使表明，在同日方就上述问题达成协议并且付诸生效的时候，苏联政府将审查苏联目前在保护鱼源方面所采取的措施的问题。
    在得到日本政府的回答的时候，苏联政府会考虑指定自己的代表团进行上述问题的谈判。
