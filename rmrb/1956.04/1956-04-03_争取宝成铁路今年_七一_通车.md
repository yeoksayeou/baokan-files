Strive for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway to Open to Traffic on "July 1st" This Year
    Dù Huápíng
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway has to cross the perpetually snow-capped Qinling Mountains and the Yanmen Mountain area, historically known as a natural barrier; it has to pass through the crisscrossing rivers and canals of the western Sichuan Plain and the turbulent Jialing River. Construction began on July 1, 1952, and now, the track-laying project for the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway is only a little over a hundred kilometers from completion. The northern section of the track-laying project has already crossed the treacherous Qinling Mountains, and the southern section of the track-laying project also extended northward from the Xujiaping Station, 472 kilometers away from Chengdu, on March 15. It is expected that by the end of June this year, the northern and southern track-laying armies will have a triumphant meeting at the Huangsha River in Huixian County, Gansu, and on July 1, the train can run all the way from Baoji to Chengdu.
    The Chengdu-Guangyuan section, which has already been opened to traffic, has officially started transportation operations, and the Guangyuan-Lueyang section has also started segmented temporary transportation operations and the transportation of road construction materials. The people along the route affectionately call the Baoji-Chengdu Railway the "Road to Happiness." This is a very appropriate metaphor. Wherever the railway goes, the impoverished conditions in the mountainous areas are gradually changing. Plows, pesticides, and fertilizers manufactured in Chengdu are transported to northern Sichuan, enabling farmers there to achieve unprecedented bumper harvests. Farmers in the Yangpingguan area of southern Shaanxi have begun to eat inexpensive Sichuan white sugar and well salt. The people of Mianyang and other places are able to buy coal from other places. The more than 200,000 jin of walnuts, peppers, and almonds produced annually in Lueyang have found a market.
    For more than three years, the 130,000 to 140,000 people who participated in the construction of this railway have been marching towards nature day and night. Whether it is wind and snow, scorching sun, incessant rain, floods, high mountains, quicksand, poisonous snakes, or wild beasts... no difficulty can stop them. "一心跨过千江水，双手凿开万重山" ["With one heart crossing a thousand rivers, with both hands chiseling through ten thousand mountains"], what magnificent words from the workers! Yes, they do what they say. Now, on the entire line, they have built more than 400 bridges and excavated more than 200 tunnels with their own hands. The Qinling Tunnel is more than 2,300 meters long, and the stone is both soft and hard. Some of the stone is like thin mud, and a single blow with a pickaxe can cause a collapse. Workers who had been tempered in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea came up with the working method of "wooden board backing, step-by-step support," and subdued more than 200 major and minor collapse accidents, ensuring the smooth progress of the project. When encountering hard rock, the steel drill bit would spark and could not drill a blasting hole. The workers came up with the "salt quenching drill, oil quenching drill" method, and also learned the advanced experience of full excavation, thus doubling work efficiency. The Qinling Tunnel was finally opened two months ahead of schedule, and thousands of tunnel technicians were trained here. There are also many heroic deeds in bridge construction. Near Yangpingguan in Shaanxi, there is the Jialing River No. 2 Bridge, one of the sixteen-span Jialing River bridges of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Last spring, when the caisson of the No. 7 bridge pier was being sunk, the "peach blossom water" from the melting winter snow rose sharply, and the turbulent river water flowed at a speed of three meters per second, carrying a large amount of sand and gravel, rushing into the caisson from under the well, so that 13,000 gallons of water needed to be drained per minute in the well for the workers to work. The youth commando team that mined sand and gravel in the well was often forced to stop work because the water was too deep. However, these young people came up with the idea of building soft ladders in the well and using their own quilts in sacks to block the springs in the well.
    On the construction site, which is hundreds of miles long, people can hear the roar of machinery and the roar of mountain blasting wherever they go, and sometimes they can also see those joint operation machinery groups. Now, about half of the tunnels on the entire line are excavated with rock drills, and some key tunnels also use battery cars and winches to remove slag and transport materials. For the larger bridge projects on the entire line, mechanical pumping is used, and concrete is poured with mixers. For station yard projects that require large-scale filling, such as Lueyang, Zhanerxiang, Xipo, and Fengzhou, partial mechanical construction is used. Some key earthwork projects, such as the Qingshiya and Guanyinshan station yards in the northern section, had to be built on mountain slopes where there was no foothold. It was impossible to carry out mechanical construction, and manual excavation was too slow. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the staff adopted a large number of blasting methods. As a result, with one blast, more than 200,000 cubic meters of stone, enough to fill 15,000 train cars, flew and filled the designated place, and a broad station prototype immediately appeared there, shortening the construction period by four to six months.
    The staff and engineering technicians who built the Baoji-Chengdu Railway have greatly improved their construction technology and machinery operation skills after several years of training. Encouraged by the great victory in the socialist transformation cause, these people who are loyal to the construction of the motherland are actively tapping endless potential to ensure the early completion of the major tasks assigned to them by the Party and the people. The staff of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has re-arranged the construction period to ensure that the construction task of the Baolue North Section is completed two months ahead of schedule. The youth commando team of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has also proposed to complete the Baolue South Section project four months ahead of schedule. According to the current enthusiasm of the staff, it is very likely that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will be fully opened to traffic on July 1 ahead of schedule.

    争取宝成铁路今年“七一”通车
    杜华平
    宝成铁路要翻越经年积雪的秦岭山脉和古称天险的雁门山区，要通过河渠交错的川西平原和波涛汹涌的嘉陵江。从1952年7月1日开工修建，到现在，宝成铁路全线铺轨工程只剩下一百多公里了。北段铺轨工程已经越过了艰险的秦岭，南段铺轨工程，也在三月十五日从离开成都472公里的徐家坪车站向北伸延，预计在今年六月底，南北二路铺轨大军即可在甘肃徽县境内的黄沙河胜利会师，七月一日火车就可以从宝鸡一直开往成都去。
    已经通车的成都广元段正式开始了运输营业，广元略阳段也开始了分段临时运输营业和运送修路器材。沿线人民都亲切地叫宝成铁路做“幸福之路”。这是很恰当的比喻。铁路所到的地方，山区的贫困面貌正在逐渐改变。成都制造的步犁、农药、肥料运到川北，使那里的农民获得空前的丰产。陕南阳平关一带的农民开始吃到便宜的四川白糖和井盐。绵阳等地人民能够买到外来的煤炭。略阳年产二十多万斤的核桃、花椒、杏仁都有了销路。
    三年多来，参加修建这条铁路的十三、四万人，日日夜夜地向自然界大进军，不管是风雪，还是烈日、淫雨、洪水、高山、流沙、毒蛇，猛兽……任何困难都挡不住他们。“一心跨过千江水，双手凿开万重山”，这是工人们多么雄壮的豪语啊！是的，他们说到那里就做到那里。现在全线上，他们用自己的手架起了四百多座桥梁，开凿了二百多条隧道。秦岭隧道长达二千三百多公尺，石头有软有硬。有的石头像稀泥一样，十字镐一碰，就有塌方的危险。曾在抗美援朝的斗争中受过锻炼的工人们，想出了“木板背顶，步步支撑”的工作方法，制服了大大小小的二百多次塌方事故，保证工程顺利进行。碰上硬石头，钢钎打上直冒火花，钻不出炮眼来。工人们想出“食盐淬钎、机油淬钎”法，又学习了全面开挖的先进经验，工作效率因而加倍地提高。秦岭大隧道终于提前两个月打通了，并且在这里锻炼出成千名隧道技术工人。在架桥中，也有很多英雄事迹。陕西阳平关附近有座嘉陵江二号桥，是宝成铁路十六跨嘉陵江的大桥之一。去年春天正下七号桥基沉井的时候，冬雪融化的“桃花水”暴涨了，汹涌的江水每秒钟流速三公尺，夹着大量的沙石，从井下冲进沉井，因而井下每分钟需要排水一万三千加仑，工人才能工作。井下采沙石的青年突击队，经常因水太深而被迫停工。但是，这些年轻人又想法在井里搭好软梯，用自己的被絮装在麻袋里，堵住了井下泉眼。
    在几百里路长的工地上，人们不论走到那里，都可以听到机械的吼叫和开山爆破的轰鸣，有时还可以看到那些联合作业的机械群。现在全线半数左右的隧道都是用凿岩机开挖的，有些重点隧道，还利用电瓶车和卷扬机除碴运输。全线较大的桥梁工程，都用机械抽水，用搅拌机浇灌混凝土。需要大填方的略阳、站儿巷、西坡、凤州等站场工程，都采用部分机械施工。有些重点土石方，如北段的青石崖、观音山站场，因为要修在无立脚之地的山坡上，不能实行机械施工，用人力开挖又太慢。职工们在苏联专家指导下，采用大量爆破的方法。结果，一声炮响，能装一万五千个火车皮的二十多万方石头都飞填在指定的地方，马上那里出现一个宽广的车站雏型，工期也缩短四个月到六个月。
    修建宝成铁路的职工和工程技术人员们，经过几年来的锻炼，在施工技术上，机械操作上，都有了很大的提高。在社会主义改造事业取得伟大胜利的鼓舞下，这些忠于祖国建设的人们正积极挖掘无穷的潜力，保证提前完成党和人民交给他们的重大任务。铁道部第六工程局职工已经重新安排了工期，保证再提前两个月完成宝略北段的修建任务。铁道部第二工程局全局的青年突击队又倡议提前四个月完成宝略南段的工程。根据目前职工的劲头看，宝成铁路很可能提前在七月一日全线通车。
