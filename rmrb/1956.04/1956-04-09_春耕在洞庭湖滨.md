Spring winds have turned the willows green along the embankment. On the fertile plains of the Dongting Lake shore, hundreds of thousands of agricultural production cooperative members have begun their intensive spring ploughing.

    On March 20th, we visited Dongxi Township in Yuanjiang County. All seven hundred-plus farmer households in this township have joined the Xingxing (Stars) Agricultural Cooperative. In those more than 4,600 mu of winter-prepared fields, the members are pumping water into the fields, preparing for the second ploughing. The cooperative also has more than 1,400 mu of paddy fields, which in the past were planted with rice after only two ploughings and two harrowings. This year, they have already ploughed and harrowed three times, and are transporting fertilizer to the fields. After one more ploughing and harrowing, they will be ready for transplanting.

    Among the working crowd, there are many women. Last year, only eighty-plus women in the township participated in field production; this year, more than four hundred and seventy women are working in the fields. For example, in cooperative member Zhou Dian's family of three, only the man labored last year, while the woman stayed home to take care of the children. Now, the woman has also joined the labor force, entrusting the children to her mother, from whom she has separated. On clear days, the doors of many cooperative members' homes are locked, as the whole family participates in the labor.

    On this vast and fertile field, particularly eye-catching is the irrigation network composed of four main canals and eleven branch canals. These canals neatly divide the large expanse of paddy fields. On the newly turned soil on both sides of the canals, rows of willow branches have been planted. This area is low-lying and prone to waterlogging disasters in previous years, but now, with this drainage and irrigation system, there is no fear of drought or flood disasters. Wang Dongsheng, the director of the Xingxing Cooperative, told us that last year, the Qiyi (July 1st) Cooperative wanted to build a drainage canal, but because of the small number of households, the large scale of the project, and the need to excavate some fields, it never happened. This year, their advanced cooperative completed the huge project of newly opening four main canals and renovating eleven branch canals within the entire township in just over a month. He said: "With these water conservancy conditions, we are 100% sure to plant double-cropping rice this year, and strive to produce more than 1,000 jin of rice per mu.”

    Indeed, all the members of this cooperative are full of confidence in achieving a thousand-jin yield. In order to cultivate double-cropping rice well, they started drying and selecting seeds on March 20th, and will put the seeds into the mud before the Qingming Festival, advancing the rice transplanting season by half a month. The youth shock brigade of the ninth production team has already sown 120 jin of dry rice seedlings. On the 20th, the seeds had already sprouted. They will strive to trial plant three crops of rice this year, creating high-yield fields with a yield of 2,000 jin per mu. In the cooperative's toilets and along the field ridges, more than one million dan of various fertilizers have been accumulated. They are not satisfied with this, and will also collect lake grass and buy commercial fertilizers. The technicians of the nine teams in the cooperative have just returned from training in the county the day before. When selecting and soaking seeds, they will use new methods such as baking soda seed selection. In the subsequent series of double-cropping rice cultivation processes, they will universally teach the members technology and use new farming techniques to cultivate the land.

    In this spring ploughing season, on the vast plains of the Dongting Lake shore, thousands of agricultural cooperatives, like the Xingxing Cooperative, are throwing themselves into the first spring ploughing after collectivization with full production enthusiasm and in an orderly manner.

    春耕在洞庭湖滨
    本报记者　高长任
    春风吹绿了堤边的杨柳，在肥沃的洞庭湖滨大平原上，千千万万农业生产合作社的社员开始了紧张的春耕。
    三月二十日，我们访问了沅江县东锡乡。这个乡七百多户农民全部参加了星星农业合作社了。在那四千六百多亩的冬扳田里，社员们正在向田里车水，准备第二次翻耕。这个社还有一千四百多亩水田，过去都是两犁两耙就插秧，今年，他们已经犁、耙过三次，正在向田里运送肥料，只要再耕耙一次便可以插秧了。
    在劳动的人群中，妇女很多。去年全乡只有八十多个妇女参加田间生产，今年已经有四百七十多人在田里干活了。有个社员周迪安一家三口，去年只是男的劳动，女的在家照顾小孩，现在，女的也参加了劳动，把小孩子托给分了家的母亲照顾。在晴朗的天气里，许多社员的家门上都落了锁，全家参加劳动。
    在这一大片肥沃的田野上，特别惹人注目的是由四条干渠、十一条支渠组成的灌溉网，这些渠道把大片水田整齐地分割开来。渠道两边新翻起来的泥土上，已经植上了一排排的柳枝。这里地势低洼，往年最怕渍水成灾，现在有了这个排灌系统，就不怕水旱灾害了。星星社的主任王冬生告诉我们，去年，有个七一社很想修一条排水的渠道，因为户数少，工程大，又要挖毁一些田，总没有办成。在今年，他们高级社只化了一个多月的时间，就在全乡范围内完成了新开四条干渠，整修十一条支渠的巨大工程。他说：“有了这个水利条件，就是我们社里今年要100％种双季稻，争取每亩田产一千多斤稻谷的保证。”
    的确，这个社的全体社员对千斤丰产充满了信心。为了种好双季稻，他们在三月二十日这一天，就开始晒种、选种，在清明节前把谷种下泥，把插秧的季节提前半个月。第九生产大队的青年突击队已经播下了一百二十斤谷种的旱秧，二十日这一天，谷种已经出芽，他们要在今年争取试种三季稻，创造亩产两千斤的高额丰产田。在这个社的厕所里、田塍边，已经积了各种肥料一百多万担，他们并没有因此满足，还要打湖草和买商品肥料。全社九个大队的技术员，前一天刚刚在县里受训回来，选种、浸种的时候，他们就要采用小苏打选种等新办法，在以后一系列育双季稻的过程中，他们要向社员普遍传授技术，用新的耕作技术来种田。
    在这春耕季节里，在洞庭湖滨大平原上，千万个农业合作社都和星星社一样，以饱满的生产热情，有秩序地投入合作化以后第一次春耕。
