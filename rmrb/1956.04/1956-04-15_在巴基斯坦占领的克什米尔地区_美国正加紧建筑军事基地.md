Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 13th (TASS) - According to a "Indian Express" reporter's dispatch from Srinagar, news from the Kashmir territory occupied by the Pakistani army states that Gilgit, a strategically important location in the region, has become a large-scale military base.

The airfields at Chitral and Gilgit have been put into combat readiness. These airfields have been greatly expanded according to the instructions of American engineers who inspected them, making them capable of accommodating heavy bombers. The Gilgit-Hunza-Chitral-Peshawar highway, built in 1951, has also been greatly expanded to accommodate heavy vehicles.

Since Pakistan began receiving U.S. military aid, the number of Pakistani troops in the area has tripled.

In Gilgit, military conferences attended by senior U.S. military officers are frequently held. Military schools have been established in Gilgit and in the Northwest Frontier Province to train troops in mountain and winter warfare. Residents' access to the area is strictly limited, and special permits from the authorities are required to travel there.

    在巴基斯坦占领的克什米尔地区
    美国正加紧建筑军事基地
    新华社据塔斯社德里13日电　据“印度快报”记者自斯利那加报道，来自巴基斯坦军队所占领的克什米尔领土的消息说，这个地区的重要战略地吉尔吉特已经变成大规模的军事基地。
    奇特拉尔和吉尔吉特的飞机场已经实行战斗准备。这些飞机场已经按照对这些飞机场进行检查的美国工程师的指示大大扩大，使之能够容纳重型轰炸机。在1951年修筑的吉尔吉特—罕萨—奇特拉尔—白沙瓦公路也已经大大扩大，使之能够行驶重型汽车。
    自从巴基斯坦开始接受美国的军事援助以后，这个地区的巴基斯坦军队的人数就增加了两倍。
    在吉尔吉特，常常举行有美国高级军官参加的军事会议。在吉尔吉特以及在西北部的边疆省设立了军事学校，训练军队在山地和冬季作战。居民进入这个地区要受到严格的限制，到那里去旅行需要当局的特别许可。
