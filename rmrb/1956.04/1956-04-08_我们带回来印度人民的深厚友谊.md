We Bring Back the Deep Friendship of the Indian People
Wu Han

On the fourth day after returning to Beijing from India, at a film reception at the Indian Embassy, the host, Ambassador R.K. Nehru and his wife, asked me: "What did you bring back from India?" I said: "Friendship, we brought back the deep friendship of the Indian people towards the Chinese people."

The color documentary shown that evening of the Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to India featured many cities we had visited. We once again saw those familiar faces, felt that deeply sincere emotion, admired the picturesque scenery, and admired the achievements of the Indian people in industrial and agricultural construction. A week later, at the welcoming reception of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, we watched this film again, still engrossed and enthusiastic. We could name many cities, streets, and buildings, name many Indian friends, and felt a sense of kinship and joy from the bottom of our hearts. It was as if, in these short two hours, we were back in India, seeing the magnificent architecture of the Taj Mahal, the beautiful gardens of Mysore, the bright beaches of Madras, the bustling streets of Calcutta, the huge sluice gates of the Nangal project, and the ruins of the ancient Nalanda University. The many friends who had received and accompanied us also appeared in our memories, one by one, like a film. When the film showed cheers for the brotherhood between the Soviet Union and India, our hearts also cheered "Hindi Chini bhai bhai!" This phrase, which we heard every day in India, was also an Indian phrase that every member of our delegation learned.

Even the etiquette we learned in India was unconsciously used on many occasions. When members of the delegation said goodbye to each other, they didn't shake hands but clasped their palms together. After thinking for a moment, they shook hands again, and everyone laughed.

It has been more than a month since we returned. Although every member of the delegation is busy with their original work, whenever we meet on an informal occasion, we always talk about India, always expressing our longing for this hospitable country and its people. We have, on many occasions, reported our impressions of our visit to India, the friendship and concern of the Indian people for the Chinese people, the achievements of the Indian people in various aspects of the Five-Year Plan, and the heartfelt support of the Indian people for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and their confidence and determination to maintain peace in the Far East and the world, in gatherings of a few people, hundreds of people, and even thousands of people. In some occasions, the artists of the delegation also performed songs, instrumental music, and dances learned from India. The beautiful songs, the gorgeous costumes, and the rhythm of the ankle bells brought the audience to the country where we had been warmly received.

The memory of India, this great and beautiful country, the memory of the Indian people who care about the construction achievements of the Chinese people and love the Chinese people, is a common feeling of every member of the delegation. The short forty-six-day visit, the stay in forty-two cities, and the contact with more than two hundred thousand friends have left us with unforgettable impressions.

We remember that in countless gatherings, Indian friends recounted to us the ancient and long-standing cultural relationship between the people of India and China: sugar was brought to India from China, and the Indian word for it is "Chini," which means China. Silk, paper, porcelain, compasses, gunpowder, and fishing nets were also brought from China. Many places have Chinese villages where Chinese merchants and their descendants once lived. In Rajgir, in Naples, and in Nalanda, the scholars there told us the stories of Faxian, Xuanzang, and others, and felt proud that their ancestors had received them. We also talked about the influence that Kumarajiva, Sanghadeva, Buddhabhadra, and Dharmagupta from India gave to Chinese culture when they lectured and translated scriptures in China. We talked about the relationship between Indian medicine, sculpture, music, phonology, dance and Chinese culture. Historical narratives proved that through cultural and economic exchanges, the people of the two countries forged a deep friendship in a peaceful atmosphere. There has never been a record of war in the history of the two countries.

In any conversation, we mentioned the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, called Panchsheel in Indian. We felt particularly close to the meeting of the two Prime Ministers. The friendship between the people of the two countries over thousands of years has been newly developed due to the mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of the two countries and many cultural delegations of the two countries. We are proud that the Five Principles are increasingly supported by the people of all countries in the world. We said that we have developed and consolidated this friendly relationship on the basis of the Five Principles, providing a model for peaceful coexistence for the people all over the world and making a beneficial contribution to world peace. These words, these common words, Indian friends said this way, and we also said this way. History and reality have provided a consistent basis for our common words, and as a result, it is impossible to distinguish which ones were said by the hosts and which ones were said by the guests. Of course, there have sometimes been disputes. For example, regarding sugar mentioned above, most Indian friends said that it was brought to India from China, but on individual occasions, some Indian friends said that this was not the case, but rather it was transmitted from India to China. Others said that this was a complex exchange process. It was initially transmitted from China to India. After a long time, India invented a processing method to refine granulated sugar into icing sugar, which was then transmitted back to China. Finally, we agreed with the opinion of this repeated exchange, and added an editorial note: sugar is flowing back and forth in the relationship between China and India, and the people of both China and India have made contributions to this sweet and indispensable food in daily life. From sugar, we talked about peace, just like sugar, peace is a common requirement of the people of our two countries, the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and Indonesia, Burma... and all peace-loving people in the world. We have contributed sugar to mankind, so let us and all peace-loving people in the world work harder to make peace, lasting peace in the Far East and the world, our common goal, and make peace, like sugar, an indispensable part of the daily life of the world's people.

We saw many magnificent and wonderful ancient buildings, which are well preserved, and the repair and maintenance work of some buildings is in progress. We also visited many museums, which displayed ancient sculptures, paintings, handwritten classics, and other works of art and handicrafts discovered in the surrounding areas, and there were very skilled experts to explain them to visitors. We were very happy to answer our friends: "People who value the long-standing cultural heritage of their own country and their own ancestors will also respect the culture of other countries and peoples. People who cherish and mutually respect cultural heritage will also contribute to the cause of peace." Indian friends said: "That's right. We are doing this, and we also know that your country and your people are also doing this."

We also visited many large-scale water conservancy projects, many modern factories, and villages under construction. We saw the labor of Indian workers, farmers, and intellectuals, and shared their joy. All this is very familiar to us, because in our country, our people, like the Indian people, are carrying out huge construction in all aspects, carrying out selfless labor with unparalleled enthusiasm. During the visit, we deeply felt the Indian people's love for peace and their will and mood to strive for peace. The Indian people, who are engaged in huge peaceful construction undertakings, have the determination, confidence, and strength to defend the fruits of their peaceful construction. The Indian people believe that the unity of the people of India, the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries is the guarantee of world peace.

Yes, this is also the firm belief of the Chinese people.

We met and talked with people from all walks of life in India. What did we talk about? We talked about these things. What did we discuss? We discussed these things. When we met, it was like being a family, talking all the ordinary things. The Indian people treated us like brothers, and we also felt like we were visiting a brother's house, saying whatever we wanted, unrestrained, and enjoying this unforgettable trip happily.

Friendship, deep friendship, we brought back. We believe that what we brought back is a most precious gift that cannot be compared with any material thing.

An Indian friend put it well: "In the past, the Himalayas blocked the communication between the people of India and China, and the sea blocked the communication between the people of the two countries. However, the people of the two countries still overcame difficulties, crossed the high mountains, and crossed the sea, and established thousands of years of friendly relations. Today, high mountains and seas can no longer block us. On the contrary, the Himalayas connect the two countries, and the sea connects the two countries. The firm friendship between the people of India and China will be further developed and consolidated."

Yes, that's well said. Let the people of our two countries come and go more, know each other more, and understand each other more deeply! Let the friendship between the people of our two countries be as high as the Himalayas and as deep as the sea!

    我们带回来印度人民的深厚友谊
    吴晗
    我们从印度回到北京的第四天，在印度大使馆的电影招待晚会上，主人拉·库·尼赫鲁大使和夫人问我：“你从印度带回来什么？”我说：“友谊，我们带回来印度人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。”
    这一晚上放映的彩色的苏联领袖布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫访问印度的纪录片，有许多城市都是我们曾经访问过的，我们又一次看到那些熟识的面孔，体会到那样深刻的诚挚的感情，欣赏美丽如画的风光，钦佩印度人民在工农业建设方面的成就。一星期后，在中印友好协会的欢迎会上，我们再次看了这个影片，还是那样聚精会神，兴致勃勃，我们能够叫出许多城市、街道和建筑物的名字，叫出许多印度朋友的名字，从心坎里感觉到亲切，高兴。仿佛在这短短的两小时内，我们又好像到了印度，看到泰姬·玛哈尔雄伟的建筑，看到了买尔速美丽的园林，看到了马德拉斯明媚的海滨，看到了加尔各答热闹的市面，看到了南加尔巨大的水闸工程，看到了古老的那烂陀大学的遗址，看到了曾经接待我们陪伴我们的许多朋友，他们的声音笑貌也像电影一样，一个一个在回忆中出现。当电影上在欢呼苏联印度是兄弟的时候，我们的心里也在欢呼“印度秦尼拜依拜依！”这句我们在印度天天听到的话，也是我们代表团每一个成员都学会的印度话。
    甚至，我们在印度学会的礼节，也在许多场合不自觉地用上了，代表团成员在互相告别的时候，不是拉手而是合掌，想了一想，再拉一次手，大家都笑了。
    我们回来已经一个多月了，虽然每一个代表团的成员都忙于自己的原来工作，但是，在偶然的场合碰上的时候，总要谈印度，总要诉述自己对于这个好客的国家和人民的怀念。我们曾经在许多场合，几个人、几百人的以至几千人的集会上，报告访问印度的观感，报告印度人民对中国人民的友情和关怀，报告印度人民在五年计划中所取得的各方面成就，和印度人民对于和平共处五项原则的衷心支持，对于维护远东和世界和平的信心和决心。在有些场合，代表团的艺术家们还表演了从印度学回来的歌唱、器乐和舞蹈，美妙的歌声，绮丽的服装和脚铃的节奏把观众也带到我们曾经被热情款待的国度去了。
    对于印度这个伟大的美丽的国家的怀念，对于关心中国人民建设成就，热爱中国人民的印度人民的怀念，是代表团每一个成员的共同的感情。在短短的四十六天的访问，四十二个城市的勾留，二十万以上朋友的接触中，给我们留下了难忘的印象。
    我们记得，在无数次的集会中，印度朋友向我们追述印中两国人民的古老的悠久的文化关系：糖是中国传到印度去的，印度话叫秦尼，秦尼是中国。丝绸和纸、瓷器、罗盘针、火药、鱼网也都是中国传去的，许多地方有中国村，曾经住过中国商人和他们的子孙。在王舍城，在拿不勒斯，在那烂陀，那里的学者们对我们述说法显、玄奘等的故事，并以自己的先人曾经接待他们而感觉骄傲。我们也谈起印度的鸠摩罗什、僧迦提婆、佛陀跋陀罗、达摩笈多到中国讲学译经，所给与中国文化的影响。谈到印度医学、雕刻、音乐、音韵、舞蹈和中国文化的关系。从历史的叙述证明了通过文化和经济的交流，在和平的气氛中，两国人民结成了深厚的友谊。在两国的历史中，从来没有战争的记录。
    在任何一次谈话中，我们都提到著名的和平共处五项原则、印度话叫做潘查希拉。我们为两国总理的会见而特别感到亲切。几千年来的两国人民的友谊由于两国总理和两国的许多文化代表团的相互访问而有了新的发展。我们为五项原则越来越广泛地得到世界各国人民的支持而感到自豪。我们说，我们在五项原则的基础上发展和巩固了这种友谊关系，给世界各地人民以和平共处的示范作用，给世界和平作出了有益的贡献。这些话，这些家常话，印度朋友这样说，我们也这样说。历史和现实为我们提供了家常话的一致基础，结果是分不出那些是主人说的，那些是客人说的。当然，有时候也曾经发生过争论，例如上面提到过糖，大多数印度朋友都说是从中国传到印度的，但是，在个别场合，有的印度朋友说不是这样，相反是从印度传到中国去的。又有人说，这是复杂的交流过程，最初从中国传到印度，经过很长时间，印度发明了加工办法，把砂糖提炼成糖霜，又传回到中国去了。最后，我们同意这个反复交流的意见，并且加上按语，糖在中印两国的关系上是流来流去的，中印两国人民都对这个甜蜜的日常生活不可缺少的食品有过贡献。从糖又谈到和平，正和糖一样，和平是我们两国人民，苏联以及人民民主国家和印度尼西亚、缅甸……和世界上所有各国爱好和平的人民的共同要求。我们曾经把糖贡献给人类，那么，让我们和全世界爱好和平的人民更加努力把和平、远东和世界持久和平作为我们共同争取的目标，让和平像糖一样，成为世界人类日常生活中不可缺少的东西吧。
    我们看了许多壮丽奇伟的古代建筑，保存得很好，有的建筑物的修缮保固工程正在进行。也看了许多博物馆，把邻近地区所发现的古代雕刻绘画、手写经典、其他美术品工艺品陈列出来，有很熟练的专家给参观者讲解。我们很高兴地回答朋友们：“凡是重视自己国家自己祖先的悠久文化遗产的人们，也必然会尊重别的国家和人民的文化。对于文化遗产的珍重和互相尊重的人民，也必然会对和平事业作出贡献。”印度朋友们说：“很对。我们这样做，我们也知道你们的国家和人民也正在这样做。”
    我们也参观了许多规模巨大的水利工程，许多现代化的工厂和正在建设中的乡村。我们看到了印度工人、农民和知识分子的劳动，分享了他们的喜悦。这一切对于我们来说，是非常熟识的，因为在我们的国家，我们的人民和印度人民一样，正在进行各方面的巨大建设，以无比的热情进行忘我的劳动。在访问参观的过程中，我们深刻体会到印度人民爱好和平和争取和平的意志和心情。正在进行巨大的和平建设事业的印度人民，有决心也有信心和力量来保卫他们所取得的和平建设的成果。印度人民相信印度、苏联、中国和其他爱好和平国家的人民团结一致，是世界和平的保证。
    是的，这也是中国人民的坚强信念。
    我们和印度各阶层的人见了面，谈了话。谈些什么呢？谈的就是这些。讨论些什么呢？讨论的也就是这些。我们见了面就像一家人一样，尽说些家常话。印度人民把我们当作兄弟款待，我们也像到兄弟家里一样，想什么就说什么，无拘无束，欢欣愉快地享受了这次难忘的旅行。
    友谊，深厚的友谊，我们带回来了。我们认为我们带回来的是任何物质的东西所不能比拟的，最最珍重的礼物。
    印度一位朋友说得好：“过去，喜马拉雅山阻隔了印中两国人民的来往，大海阻隔了两国人民的来往。但是，两国人民还是克服了困难，越过高山，越过大海，建立了几千年的友好关系。今天，高山、大海都不能再阻隔我们了。相反，喜马拉雅山把两个国家连结起来，大海把两个国家联结起来了。印中两国人民的坚固的友谊将会更加发展，更加巩固。”
    是的，说得很好。让我们两国人民更多地来往，更多地认识，更深地了解吧！让我们两国人民之间的友谊像喜马拉雅山那样高，大海那样深吧！
