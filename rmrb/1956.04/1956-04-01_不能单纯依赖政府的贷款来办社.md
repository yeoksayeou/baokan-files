Cannot Solely Rely on Government Loans to Run Cooperatives
To the Editor:
    Sixteen fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives have been established in Longjin District, An'yi County, Jiangxi Province. Some cooperatives showed a tendency to rely on government assistance when formulating their plans. For example, Dinghu Cooperative wanted the government to lend them 60,000 jin of fertilizer powder; Tianbu, Baishu, and four other cooperatives requested loans for 28 head of draught cattle; Yanghu Cooperative requested loans to buy 20,000 jin of fertilizer powder, 10,000 jin of granular fertilizer, 8,200 jin of superphosphate, and 4,000 jin of bone meal. As a result, the production costs in some cooperatives' plans exceeded 20% of the total income, while the value of labor was relatively reduced.
    After discovering this situation, the An'yi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized the members of the sixteen advanced cooperatives in Longjin District to study the documents on "Running Cooperatives Diligently and Frugally" in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," and conducted inspections of the cooperatives' management policies. Through this study, the members realized that the idea of relying on others was wrong and that they should use their own strength to do a good job in preparing for cultivation. All eighteen cadres of Baishu Cooperative contributed their personal savings to invest in the cooperative, raising a total of 118 yuan in RMB, as well as a considerable amount of gold and silver jewelry. Inspired by the cadres, the members also actively invested in the cooperative. In the investment process, the cooperatives also paid attention to helping members with tight food rations to solve their difficulties. For example, Wu Jiaying and Liu Deyan, the cadre leaders of Dinghu Cooperative, led the members to carry out a production increase and frugality movement, mobilizing them to save grain and adjust it for members with tighter rations.
    In addition, after careful calculation, the production costs of each cooperative were greatly reduced. According to statistics from Dinghu, Zhongzhou, and six other cooperatives, they could reduce the purchase of fertilizer powder by 190,000 jin, and prepare to dig more pond mud to replace it. Tianbu Cooperative originally requested a loan to buy 20 head of cattle, which was solved by their own efforts. Now, the sixteen cooperatives have reduced their loan requests from the government by a total of 100,000 yuan.

### 不能单纯依赖政府的贷款来办社

    不能单纯依赖政府的贷款来办社编辑同志：
    江西省安义县龙津区成立了十六个完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。有些社在订计划的时候，曾经出现了依赖政府帮助办社的思想。像鼎湖社要政府贷给六万斤肥田粉，田埠、柏树等六个社要求贷给二十八条耕牛款，阳湖社要求贷款买肥田粉两万斤、颗粒肥料一万斤、过磷酸钙八千二百斤和牛骨粉四千斤。因此，有些社所订的计划中生产费用已经超过总收入的20％，而劳动价值却相对地降低了。
    中共安义县委发现这个情况以后，就组织龙津区十六个高级社的社员学习“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书中有关“勤俭办社”的文件，并且对本社的经营方针进行检查。经过这次学习，社员们都认识了依赖思想是不对的，应该用自己的力量来做好备耕工作。柏树社十八个干部都拿出了私人积蓄向社里投资，一共凑了人民币118元，还有不少金银首饰。在干部的带动下，社员们也积极向社里投资了。各社在投资中，还注意帮助口粮较紧的社员解决困难。如鼎湖社社干部吴家英、刘德彦等领导社员开展增产节约运动，动员社员节约粮食，调剂给口粮较紧的社员。
    此外，经过精打细算，各社生产费用都大大降低了。据鼎湖、中洲等八个社统计，就可以少买肥田粉十九万斤，准备多挖塘泥来代替。田埠社原来要求贷款买牛二十条，经过自己设法困难解决了。现在，十六个社一共少向政府贷款十万元。
