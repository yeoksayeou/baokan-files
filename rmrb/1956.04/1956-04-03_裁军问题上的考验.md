The United Nations Disarmament Commission's Subcommittee meeting in London has been going on for two weeks. According to reports, the representatives of the countries concerned have expressed at the meeting their willingness to take steps to genuinely advance the work of disarmament. Now, all peace-loving people are watching with anticipation for the representatives attending the meeting to take practical actions to prove their sincerity. The Soviet representative's proposal of a new disarmament plan on March 27 has been warmly welcomed by international public opinion.

The Soviet proposal advocates the conclusion of an international agreement on the issue of reducing conventional armaments and armed forces, stipulating that measures to limit and reduce conventional armaments and armed forces should be completed in 1956-1958. This is another major effort by the Soviet Union to resolve the disarmament issue. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has consistently advocated that countries should reach an agreement on the implementation of banning atomic weapons and reducing conventional armaments and armed forces, and believes that removing atomic weapons from national armaments is an indispensable step to eliminate the threat of war. However, for a long time, Western countries have refused to abandon atomic weapons on the pretext that an effective supervisory system cannot be established, causing the entire disarmament issue to fall into a stalemate. The Soviet Union now reiterates the necessity of banning atomic weapons, but in order to break the deadlock, it suggests that countries should first take measures to reduce conventional armaments and armed forces before an agreement is reached on banning atomic weapons. The Soviet Union believes that countries can and should strengthen mutual trust through some positive steps to stop the arms race, thereby helping to reach an agreement on the most important issue of guaranteeing peace: the prohibition of atomic weapons. This new effort by the Soviet Union to narrow differences and bring the two sides' opinions closer together has cleared the way for the Soviet Union and Western countries to reach at least a preliminary agreement on the disarmament issue.

British former Foreign Secretary Macmillan expressed at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference last year that he believed that in the event of difficulties in concluding a general disarmament agreement, efforts should be made to first obtain a preliminary agreement on the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments in order to begin disarmament. Recently, the French head of government has also repeatedly stated that it is important to take action on the disarmament issue. The Soviet Union's new proposal is fully in line with this requirement, and it also fully takes into account the various parties' claims regarding disarmament.

The level of troop reductions stipulated in the new Soviet plan is also based on the troop limits previously proposed by Western countries. At the same time, the Soviet proposal stipulates the establishment of effective international supervision to supervise the implementation of measures to reduce conventional armaments and armed forces. The Soviet Union not only advocates granting the international supervisory agency broad rights and powers to conduct full and effective inspections in all signatory countries, but also agrees that at a certain stage of implementing the comprehensive disarmament plan, the countries concerned can consider using aerial photography as a method of supervision. This is fully in line with the spirit of implementing "supervised disarmament." Moreover, it also gives due attention to the "open skies" plan advocated by the United States. As everyone knows, as pointed out by impartial public opinion in various countries, the US "open skies" plan would be meaningless if it is not used as a method of supervising comprehensive disarmament.

The Soviet plan also proposes to establish a region in Europe including the territories of the two parts of Germany and its neighboring countries, in which armaments should be restricted and investigated, in particular, it is stipulated that the entry of atomic forces and the transportation of atomic weapons are prohibited. The Soviet Union also advocates that before an agreement is reached on regional issues, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should immediately reduce their troops stationed in Germany. Obviously, taking such measures can not only ease the arms race and reduce the danger of atomic war in Europe, but also be conducive to the resolution of the German issue and European security issues, thereby creating favorable conditions for resolving the comprehensive disarmament issue.

The Soviet Union maintains that, regardless of whether countries reach an agreement on the disarmament issue, they should agree to take some partial steps, such as: immediately stopping thermonuclear weapons tests; prohibiting troops stationed on German territory from being equipped with atomic weapons; and countries reducing military budgets. This is an irrefutable proof of the Soviet Union's sincere willingness to take steps in disarmament. The Soviet Union has always held the position that any step forward in the disarmament issue will be beneficial to peace. If countries implement the above measures, they will be able to pave the way for reaching an understanding on other more complex aspects of disarmament. The Soviet Union's proposal is fully in line with the common desire of people of all countries to urgently reduce the burden of military expenditures and eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons.

From the British and French proposals and the US proposal reported in the Western newspapers, people see that there are serious shortcomings in some key issues. For example, the plan proposed by Britain and France does not stipulate the level of armed forces to be reduced by various countries, and indefinitely postpones the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the prohibition of testing nuclear weapons. As for the United States, it not only took a step back from the troop limits previously advocated by Western countries, but also replaced genuine disarmament with "open skies" that deviates from disarmament and does not mention the necessity of prohibiting atomic weapons at all. The Soviet proposal eliminates these shortcomings and enables the disarmament issue to gradually achieve resolution in the right direction.

The Soviet Union's new disarmament proposal is so practical that Western observers believe that "this plan appears to be a 'serious' contribution to the effort to explore a disarmament agreement between the East and the West." Moreover, according to a report from the United States Information Service, American personnel in London could not help but acknowledge that the Soviet proposal was "serious, detailed, and important." Therefore, people have reason to expect the Disarmament Subcommittee to seriously discuss the disarmament plan proposed by the Soviet Union, and reach a concrete agreement on the basis of the Soviet plan, so that the disarmament cause that people all over the world care about can truly make progress. While people are encouraged by the constructive new plan proposed by the Soviet Union, they are also uneasily noting the news that Washington is "not very happy" with the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposal. As everyone knows, at the beginning of this meeting of the Disarmament Subcommittee, the United States revealed that Washington was only interested in a so-called small-scale experimental inspection plan, and was fundamentally unwilling to assume any obligations regarding comprehensive disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Now, the Soviet proposal is a good test. People all over the world will see whether the United States and other Western countries continue to talk about disarmament or truly take steps to realize this urgent hope of the people of all countries.

### 裁军问题上的考验

    裁军问题上的考验
    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在伦敦举行的会议已开了两个星期。据消息报道，有关各国的代表在会议上都表示愿意采取步骤把裁军工作真正向前推进一步。现在，一切关心和平的人们都怀着期待的心情注视着出席会议的代表们拿出实际行动来证明他们的诚意。苏联代表三月二十七日在会上提出裁军新方案，已经受到各国舆论的热烈欢迎。
    苏联的建议主张就裁减常规军备和武装部队问题缔结一项国际协定，规定在1956—1958年完成限制和裁减常规军备和武装部队的措施。这是苏联为解决裁军问题而进行的又一重大努力。大家知道，苏联一贯主张各国应该就实施禁止原子武器、裁减常规军备和武装部队问题达成协议，而且认为把原子武器从国家军备中取消是消除战争威胁的一个必不可少的步骤。但是西方国家长久以来却借口无法建立有效的监督制度而拒绝放弃原子武器，使整个裁军问题陷于僵局。苏联现在重申禁止原子武器的必要，但是为了打开僵局，它建议各国在未能就禁止原子武器达成协议以前先采取措施来裁减常规军备和武装部队。苏联认为各国可以而且应当通过停止军备竞赛的一些积极步骤来加强相互间的信任，从而有助于就禁止原子武器这个保障和平的最重要问题达成协议。苏联的这种谋求缩小分歧和使双方意见更加接近的新的努力，为苏联和西方国家在裁军问题上至少达成初步的协议扫清了道路。
    英国前外长麦克米伦在去年四国外长会议上曾经表示过，他认为在缔结一项普遍的裁军协定有困难的情况下，应当设法先取得一个有关裁减武装部队和常规军备的初步协定，以便开始裁军。最近法国政府首脑也一再表示，重要的是应该在裁军问题上进入行动。苏联的新建议就是完全符合这种要求的，而且它还充分地照顾到各方面关于裁军的主张。
    苏联新方案中所规定的各国裁减军队的水平，也是以西方国家过去所提出的军队限额为根据的。同时，苏联的建议规定了建立有效的国际监督，以监督裁减常规军备和武装部队措施的实行。苏联不仅主张给予国际监督机构以广泛的权利和权力，在各签字国进行充分和有效的视察，并且同意到实行全面裁军计划的某一阶段，有关国家可以考虑利用空中摄影作为监督的一个方法。这完全符合实行“有监督的裁军”的精神。而且它对美国所主张的“空中视察”计划也给予了应有的重视。大家知道，正如各国公正舆论所指出的，美国的“空中计划”如果不是作为全面裁军的一种监督方式，便毫无意义。
    苏联的方案还建议在欧洲建立一个包括德国两部分及其邻国的领土在内的地区，在这个地区中的军备应该受到限制和调查，特别是规定禁止开进原子部队和运入原子武器。苏联并且主张在对地区的问题达成协议以前，美、英、法、苏应当立刻减少在德国的驻军。很显然，采取这样的措施不仅能够缓和军备竞赛和减少在欧洲发生原子战争的危险，而且将有利于德国问题和欧洲安全问题的解决，从而为解决全面裁军问题创造良好的条件。
    苏联主张，各国不管对裁军问题是否达成协议，应当同意采取一些局部的步骤，例如：立刻停止热核子武器试验；禁止驻扎在德国领土上的军队配备原子武器；各国削减军事预算等。这是苏联真心诚意愿意在裁军方面开步走的无可辩驳的证明。苏联始终抱着这样的立场：在裁军问题上任何一个前进的步骤都将有利于和平。各国实现上述的措施，就能够为在裁军的其他更加复杂的方面取得谅解铺平道路。苏联的主张是完全符合各国人民迫切要求减轻军费负担、消除核子武器威胁的共同愿望的。
    从西方报刊报道的英法建议和美国建议中，人们看到在一些关键问题上存在着严重的缺点。例如，英法所提出的计划没有规定各国裁减武装部队的水平，而且把禁止核子武器和禁止试验核子武器无限期地推延下去。至于美国，它不但从西方国家过去所主张的军队限额后退了一步，而且还是拿离开裁军的“空中视察”来代替真正的裁军而根本不提禁止原子武器的必要。苏联的建议消除了这些缺点，并使裁军问题能够在正确的方向上开始逐步取得解决。
    苏联的裁军新建议是如此的切实可行，因此西方的观察家都认为“这个计划看来是对探求东西方裁军协议的努力的一个‘认真的’贡献”。而且据美国新闻处的报道，伦敦的美国人士也不能不承认苏联的建议是“认真的、详尽的和重要的”。因此，人们有理由期望裁军小组委员会认真地讨论苏联所提出的裁军方案，在苏联的方案的基础上达成具体的协议，使全世界人民所关心的裁军事业真正取得进展。当人们从苏联提出的建设性新方案得到鼓舞的时候，也不安地注意到华盛顿方面对苏联裁军新建议表示“不太高兴”的消息。大家知道，在这次裁军小组委员会开会之初，美国方面就透露说华盛顿只对一种所谓小规模的试验性视察计划有兴趣，而根本不愿意就全面裁军和禁止原子武器问题承担任何义务。现在，苏联的建议是一个很好的考验，全世界人民将要看美国和其他西方国家究竟是继续空谈裁军还是真正采取步骤来实现各国人民这一迫切的希望。
