    Visiting Factories
    Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant received more than two hundred teachers from various universities in Beijing on the 5th.
    Next to the No. 2 blast furnace at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, many old professors saw the molten iron rushing out of the furnace for the first time. Xu Yingkui, an old professor at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said: "This is the first time I have seen workers creating wealth for the country so arduously. This will urge me to treat all labor with a selfless spirit." Some professors who visited the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant toured the entire production process of the double-wheeled double-shared plow with great interest.
    During the spring holiday, more than 1,200 teachers from various universities in Beijing will also visit places such as the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory.

    高等学校教师生活
    春假游园会
    在天津的高等学校的教授、讲师和他们的家属一千多人，五日在天津市的干部俱乐部里举行了春假游园会。
    刚刚过了中午，教师们和他们的夫人就带着孩子陆续来到这里。他们来到二楼的向“科学进军”的展览室。这里展出了385件他们自己的科学论文和艺术作品和九十六位教授、讲师的科学专题研究计划。
    在俱乐厅里，有许多人参加了科学讲演会。南开大学教授何国柱和王积涛分别讲了物理和化学发展的最新成就。在游艺室里，悬挂着一百多条谜语，这些谜语联系了物理、化学、历史、语文等各方面的科学知识，猜到任何一个都可以得到奖品。南开大学历史系讲师来新夏在一个小时内就猜到了六条有关历史知识的谜语。
    下午六点，聚餐会开始了。中共天津市委员会书记、天津市市长黄火青和其他党和政府的负责人和他们一道聚餐。
    晚上，教师们进行了各种文化娱乐活动。　（据新华社讯）
    访问工厂
    石景山钢铁厂、北京农业机械厂的工人们五日分别接待了来自北京各高等学校的二百多名教师。
    在石景山钢铁厂的第二高炉旁，许多老教授第一次看到了通红的铁水从炉内奔流出来。中国协和医学院老教授许英魁说：“我第一次见到工人这样艰苦地为国家创造财富的情形。这会督促我用忘我的精神对待一切劳动。”到北京农业机械厂去参观的一些教授极有兴趣地参观了整个双轮双铧犁的生产过程。
    春假期间，北京各高等学校还将有一千二百多名教师到长辛店机车车辆修理工厂等处去访问。
