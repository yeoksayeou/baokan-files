    The Romanian national men's and women's table tennis teams held two friendly matches with the Shanghai table tennis team on the evenings of the 26th and 27th.

    The Romanian team defeated the Shanghai team with scores of 6-2 and 8-1 respectively.

    In the competition, the Romanian women's team achieved a complete victory in four singles matches and two doubles matches with an overwhelming advantage.  Meritorious athlete and six-time world women's singles champion Rozeanu easily won against Shanghai's Shen Ying and Dai Longzhu in both matches, each time in just a few minutes with a score of 2-0. The balls she cut were low and spinning, often passing over the net.

    The men's team competition was particularly tense and fierce. In the eight singles matches, the Romanian team won seven matches, and the Shanghai team won one. In the men's doubles competition, the young Shanghai athletes won two consecutive matches. In a mixed doubles match, the Romanian team won.

    The most intense match was the singles match between Romania's Gantner and Shanghai's Liu Zaoshi. At the beginning of the match, Liu Zaoshi adopted a short block tactic, and after a few short blocks, he immediately delivered a "sidespin" ball with a large angle. But the opponent responded freely, often saving many dangerous balls from more than ten feet away from the table. In the first two games, the two sides each won one game. In the third game, Gantner adopted an offensive, putting the opponent on the defensive, and won with a score of 2-1.

    In the two men's doubles matches, Shanghai athletes Xue Weichu and Xu Yinsheng played very well. They found that the opponent's defense was tight, so they adopted various tactics such as short drop shots, light blocks, and long-range smashes. In the first match, they defeated the Romanian national champion Harasztosi and Romanian Master of Sports Popescu with a score of 2-1. In the second match, the Romanian team changed to Rett and Gantner, who are Romanian players attending this year's World Table Tennis Championships for doubles. In this match, the Romanian team took the lead at the beginning, but the Shanghai team tried their best to take the initiative, used opportunities to attack, and defeated the opponent with a score of 2-0.

    罗马尼亚乒乓球队同上海队比赛
    罗马尼亚国家男、女乒乓球队二十六、二十七日晚上，连续同上海市乒乓球队举行了两场友谊比赛。
    罗马尼亚队分别以六比二，八比一战胜了上海队。
    在比赛中，罗马尼亚女子队以压倒的优势在四场单打和二场双打中取得了全胜。功勋运动员、六次世界女子单打冠军获得者罗齐亚努在两场比赛中每场只费几分钟就轻易地分别以二比零赢得了上海队的沈英和戴龙珠，她削出的球低而旋转，往往是擦网而过。
    男子队的比赛尤其紧张、激烈。在八场单打比赛中，罗马尼亚队赢了七场，上海队赢了一场。男子双打比赛，年轻的上海队运动员连胜两场。一场男女混合双打比赛，罗马尼亚队获胜。
    最激烈的一场比赛要算罗马尼亚队甘特纳和上海队刘造时的单打。比赛一开始，刘造时就采取了短挡的战术，几下短挡立刻来一个角度极大的“滑板”球。但对方却应接自如，常常从离台一丈多远的地方救出很多险球。前两局双方各胜一局。第三局甘特纳采取攻势，使对方陷于被动，以二比一获胜。
    在两场男子双打中，上海队的运动员薛伟初和徐寅生打得很出色，他们发现对方防守严密，就采取了近吊、轻挡、远抽的各种不同战术，第一场以二比一战胜了由罗马尼亚全国冠军哈拉斯托西和罗马尼亚运动健将波佩斯库。在第二场比赛中，罗马尼亚队改由雷特和甘特纳出场，他们是出席本届世界乒乓球锦标赛双打的罗马尼亚选手。在这场比赛中，一开始罗马尼亚队领先，但上海队竭力争取主动，利用机会进攻，并以二比零战胜了对方。
