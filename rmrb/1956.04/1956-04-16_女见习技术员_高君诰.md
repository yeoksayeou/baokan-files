    Female Apprentice Technician - Gao Jun诰
    By our reporters Cao Baoming and Gu Ye

    At the Shanxi Provincial Industrial Construction Activists Congress, a petite young woman in a blue floral dress walked to the podium to speak. She was a stranger to most of the people present. Some wondered what contribution someone so young could have made to industrial construction! Surprisingly, she spoke about the major issue of using "quick-setting concrete" for winter construction without any special anti-freeze equipment. This young woman was the first in the country to successfully trial this type of concrete. After the meeting, many technicians flocked to her to hear about her experiences!

    Her name is Gao Jun诰, and she is only twenty-two years old. She is an apprentice technician at the First Company of the Taiyuan Chemical and Metallurgical Construction Company. She graduated from Chongqing Civil Engineering and Architecture College in the summer of 1954.

    After Gao Jun诰 was assigned to the experiment team in Taiyuan last August, she began to promote an advanced technique first successfully learned by the North Manchuria Construction Company Processing Plant: "dry-hardened concrete." Not long after this technique was promoted on the construction site, the north wind heralded the approach of winter. In freezing weather, concrete must be heated internally using special measures to prevent it from freezing. The only way to do this was through electrical heating, which would increase construction costs. Gao Jun诰 thought, "Can't we do without electrical heating?" This question made her restless, and she searched everywhere for new construction methods.

    One day, she discovered in "Construction Technology" magazine that the Soviet Union had proven through experiments that adding gypsum to concrete could accelerate its hardening and increase its strength. Although the article did not mention using this type of concrete in temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, it immediately made her think that if she added gypsum to dry-hardened concrete, allowing the concrete to reach its design strength in a very short time without freezing, wouldn't that replace the need for electrical heating!

    She wanted to experiment. However, this new method had not been used in China before, and she had never seen it done herself. Would the leadership approve it? If the experiment failed, would others laugh at her? She felt a little timid.

    Just as she was hesitating, the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress in Beijing gave her courage. One day, she went with the other young people from the company to Taiyuan City to listen to the report from the congress. Before the report, she read an article in "China Youth" magazine. This article described how a young doctor in a forest was surrounded by three hungry wolves on a tree, and how he collapsed from exhaustion in a swamp. But this young man, inspired by the cause of socialism, successfully completed his medical mission in such difficult circumstances and was praised by the masses as a good doctor in the forest. The heroic behavior of this young doctor moved her. She sat there silently with a flushed face, her heart was boiling.

    She had always been a person full of enthusiasm for life. When Chongqing was liberated, she was still a first-year high school student. From that time on, she was educated by the Party and joined the Communist Youth League. At that time, how eager she was to go to work and train! She even secretly asked the director of an oil pressing factory to let her work in the factory, but she was not successful. Immediately after graduating from middle school, she asked the League district committee to introduce her to the Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory. Everything in the factory felt new to her. Who knew that only three months after she started working, the Party and the state decided to transfer some in-service cadres to study engineering technology, and she was recommended by the factory to go to university. Initially, she was not very interested in this change. However, the comrades in the factory, especially the factory director, a man who had completed the 25,000-mile Long March, whom she deeply admired, were happy that she was able to go to university. After she entered school, she received a letter from the factory director, in which he talked about how he learned a little culture during the Long March. At that time, they were marching day and night, and the comrades in front carried the words on their backs, letting the comrades behind read them. However, the little culture he had learned was far from enough to deal with modern industrial technology, which often put him in trouble. Therefore, he felt especially happy that she could go to university. The enthusiastic encouragement of her comrades inspired her and made her deeply feel that she could not let down the expectations of the Party and her comrades, and that she must continue to advance in her studies and work!

    But today, this young technician, who had been nurtured by the expectations of the Party and her comrades, was shrinking back in the face of difficulties.

    During the report, she clearly heard the sentence: "Difficulties can only scare away those who are weak!" This stung her heart even more. She repeatedly asked herself: "Why don't you experiment with the new method? You are too timid! Aren't you applying to join the Party? How can you act like a Party member like this!"

    As soon as she returned to the construction site, she immediately wrote a report to the Party branch, reporting some of her thoughts after listening to the report and requesting the branch to support her experiment with the new method. Soon after submitting the report, the secretary of the Youth League branch came to talk to her and told her, "The Party general branch supports your experiment."

    The experiment with the new concrete began on October 15th. Difficulties arose as soon as the experiment began. After gypsum was added to the concrete, it was difficult to tamp, and a young worker in the experimental team complained to her. She was not discouraged, but reminded herself that she should cooperate closely with the two workers in the laboratory. So she explained to them the importance of this new method and the content of the experiment. After these two workers understood that the success of the experiment would greatly benefit the reduction of costs, improvement of quality, and shortening of the construction period, they also became active. The workers suggested to her that using hot water instead of cold water could extend the setting time of the concrete and make it easier to tamp. They used instruments to measure the temperature of the water again and again, found suitable warm water, and produced the first test piece. However, whenever the workers sent the test pieces to the city for temperature testing, they always brought back bad news again and again—the test pieces did not reach the ideal strength. Every time, she frowned tightly.

    At the end of October, the weather was getting colder and colder. The processing plant had already started using electrical heating to make the beams for a certain project. The company only borrowed one transformer, and the work efficiency was very low, only making one beam a day, while the company had to complete more than 4,000 prefabricated concrete components this winter. At this time, a technician surnamed Wu came to her and said, "It is impossible to do winter construction without internal heating. You will definitely freeze the concrete like this." This made her worry all day long about what to do if the experiment failed!

    Who knew that an unexpected thing happened at this time. The First Construction Site Youth Supervision Post issued a signal to her on the wall newspaper, severely criticizing her for wasting cement. What was going on? In September, she prepared a concrete according to the requirements of Party A, and as a result, the strength of the concrete exceeded the national standard, which meant that more cement was used. As soon as she saw this criticism, she couldn't help but run back to the dormitory and cry!

    After crying for a while, she thought of many things. She remembered that when she was reading "The Young Guard" in school, she loved the heroic and adventurous Chulyenin and the courageous and calm Oleg. They were so young and so strong, and she should be like that too. She remembered that when she filled out the university application form, she always longed to go to the most difficult and challenging environment to train and fight! She remembered that when she first arrived at the construction site, some male comrades thought that "women can't do this job" and didn't assign her work, making her idle all day long. However, with the support of the Communist Youth League branch, she changed the views of these comrades with her labor. Later, she worked with the workers to solve the construction methods of special projects such as "pipeline oil hemp," and the workers welcomed her, and the leaders also praised her. Many difficulties had passed, but now she was crying in the face of the criticism of the masses and the difficulties in the experimental work. She felt that she was not strong enough and should cheer up and fight against all kinds of difficulties.

    The next morning, Gao Jun诰 went to the construction site again. After many experiments, she finally overcame various technical difficulties, and the "quick-setting concrete" experiment was successful.

    The test report form was sent back on a Saturday night in November. As soon as Gao Jun诰 saw the report form, she immediately rushed into the manager's office and said loudly, "Manager Yang, look how good this strength is!"

    "Great! The thing we were worried about is solved! Do you know? It was originally decided to use a lot of electrical heating, but it was stopped because there were not enough transformers. Now that we have a new method, we can supply a large number of prefabricated components on time without transformers," the manager said happily.

    Gao Jun诰 ran to report to the Party general branch secretary and the chief engineer, and they all sincerely congratulated her on the success of the experiment. Where else to go? She really couldn't stay alone, and immediately rushed into the weekend dance party that was going on, and excitedly spun around to the music.

    The company immediately promoted "quick-setting concrete" at various construction sites. The result of its use is that it makes the construction speed of concrete projects more than four times faster than the electrical heating method, and the final strength is also higher than that of the electrical heating method. At the same time, it can be used for winter construction in climates below minus 20 degrees Celsius without electrical heating, and the cost can be reduced by at least 9.8 yuan per cubic meter of concrete. After engineering units in Wuhan, Lanzhou, Tangshan and other places saw this news in the newspapers, they immediately sent batches of technicians to Taiyuan to learn this experience. Engineering units as far away as Yunnan and Heilongjiang also wrote letters requesting technical information. Gao Jun诰 also received many enthusiastic letters from all over the country and from the Volunteer Army.

    Late at night, she was still too excited to sleep. She wanted to write her joy in her diary. The first sentence she wrote was: "Dear Mom, I am so happy! I have never been so happy. I know the experiment has been successful. I have made a little contribution to the motherland... In future work, I must learn from national labor models and outstanding national youth socialist construction activists."

    女见习技术员——高君诰
    本报记者　曹葆铭　顾页
    在山西省工业建设积极分子大会上，在进行大会发言的时候，一个身穿蓝花衣裳、身材矮小的年轻的姑娘走到讲台前面去了。对到会的人说来，这是个陌生的人。有人想，这样小的年纪，她会在工业建设中作出什么贡献来呢！令人惊异的是她谈的竟是使用“快硬性混凝土”，不需任何特殊防冻设备，就可以进行冬季施工的重大问题，就是这个年轻的姑娘在国内首先试制成功了这种混凝土。会后，有许多技术人员拥向她，听她讲述经验！
    她名叫高君诰，今年才二十二岁，是太原化学冶金建设公司第一公司的见习技术员，1954年夏季才从重庆土木建筑学院毕业。
    去年八月，高君诰到太原担负试验组的工作以后，便开始推广北满建设公司加工厂首先学习成功的一项先进经验——“干硬性混凝土”。这项经验在工地推广不久，北风就预告冬季快来了。在冰冻的日子里，打混凝土必须采用特殊措施从内部加热才不致冻坏，这时候唯一的办法是用电气加热，这将增加建筑的成本。高君诰当时曾想：“难道不能不用电热法吗？”这个问题使她坐立不安，到处去翻书，找寻新的施工方法。
    一天，她在“建筑技术”杂志上发现苏联已经根据实验结果证明，能在混凝土中加入石膏，以加速它的硬化，提高它的强度。虽然文章里没有谈到这种混凝土在摄氏零度以下施工的情形，但是使她马上联想到，如果在干硬性混凝土中加入石膏，使混凝土在很短时间里达到设计强度，而不致冻坏，不就能代替电热法了么！
    她想进行试验。但是，这种新方法在我国还没有人用过，她自己也没见过，领导上会不会同意呢！如果试验不成功，别人会不会笑话她呢！她有些胆怯了。
    就在她犹豫不决的时候，在北京召开的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会鼓起了她的勇气。一天，她同公司的青年们到太原市里去听这个大会的传达报告。在传达以前，她在“中国青年”杂志上读到一篇通讯。这篇通讯叙述了一个森林里的青年医生怎样被三只饿狼围困在树上，怎样疲乏地昏倒在萎草塘上，但是这个为社会主义事业所鼓舞的青年，就在这样艰苦的环境里，胜利地完成了医疗任务，被群众称为森林里的好大夫。这个青年医生的英勇行为激动了她。她红着脸坐在那里一言不发，内心在沸腾。
    她一向是个对生活充满热情的人。重庆解放的时候，她还是高中一年级的学生。就从那时起，她受到党的教育，入了团。那时候，她是多么渴望到工作中去锻炼啊！她曾经私自去请求一个榨油厂的厂长让她进厂工作，没有成功。中学一毕业，她又请求团区委介绍她进了重庆电工器材厂。工厂的一切使她感到新鲜。谁知才工作三个月，党和国家决定抽调一些在职干部学习工程技术，她又由工厂保送上大学了。最初，她对这个改变并没有多大兴趣。但是，工厂的同志们，特别是厂长——一个令她非常崇敬的经过二万五千里长征的同志，为她能够上大学而高兴。她入学后收到厂长写来的信，信上谈到他自己怎样在长征中学到一点文化的。那时候日夜都在行军，由走在前面的同志背着字，让走在后面的同志读。但是，他学到的一点文化远不足以对付近代的工业技术，使他现时常常陷于困恼中。因此，他特别为她能上大学感到幸福。同志们的热情鼓励着她，使她深深地感到不能辜负党和同志们的期望，要在学习、工作中不断地前进！
    但是，就是她这个在党和同志们的期望中培育起来的青年技术员，今天在困难面前畏缩不前了。
    在听传达报告中，她清楚的听到一句话：“困难只能吓倒那些懦弱的人！”这更刺痛了她的心。她一再问自己：“你为什么不进行新方法的试验呢？太懦弱了！自己不是正申请入党吗，这怎么能像个党员的样子呢！”
    她一回到工地，马上向党支部写了一个报告，汇报这次听了传达报告的一些感想，同时请求支部支持她作新方法的试验。送上报告不久，团支部书记就找她谈话来了，并且告诉她：“党总支支持她的试验。”
    从十月十五日开始试验新的混凝土。试验一开始就遇到困难。混凝土里掺入石膏以后，很难捣固，试验组的一个青年工人就埋怨她。她没有气馁，却提醒了她应该同试验室里的两个工人亲密合作。于是她就向他们讲解这个新方法的重要意义和试验的内容。这两个工人弄清楚试验成功后对降低成本、提高质量、缩短工期都有很大好处以后，也积极起来了。工人向她建议：用热水代替冷水，可以使混凝土凝固的时间延长，便于捣固。他们又用仪表一次又一次地测定水的温度，找到了适宜的温水，制出了第一块试料。但是，每当工人将试料送到城里去作温度试验回来的时候，总是一次又一次地带回来不好的消息——试料达不到理想的强度，每一次她都紧锁着眉头。
    十月底，天气越来越冷。加工厂在制作某项工程的大梁中，已经开始采用电热法了。公司只借到了一个变压器，工作效率很低，一天只能做一根多梁，而公司在这个冬季要完成四千多件混凝土预制构件。这时候，还有个姓吴的技术员跑来向她说：“冬季施工不用内部加热是不行的，你这样非把混凝土冻坏不可。”这使她一天到晚愁着试验如果不成功怎么办！
    谁知就在这时，又出了一桩意外的事情。第一工地青年监督岗在墙报上向她发了个信号，严厉地批评她浪费了水泥。这是怎么回事呢？她在九月里按照甲方的要求配了一种混凝土，结果混凝土强度超过了国家标准，也就是多用了水泥。她一见这个批评便忍不住跑回宿舍去哭起来了！
    哭过一阵以后，她想到很多事情。她想起当她在学校里读“青年近卫军”的时候，就热爱英勇冒险的丘列宁和果敢沉着的奥列格，人家那么年轻就那样的崛强，自己也应该是这样的。记得在填上大学的志愿书的时候，总是渴望到最艰苦、最困难的环境里去锻炼，去战斗！她想起她初到工地的时候，有的男同志认为“女的干不了这行”，不分给她工作，成天闲的慌。但是，她在团支部支持下，用自己的劳动改变了这些同志的看法。后来，她又同工人们一道解决了“管道油麻”等特殊工程的施工方法，工人欢迎她，领导上也表扬她。许多困难都过去了，现在却面对着群众的批评、面对着试验工作中的困难哭了。她觉得这是自己太不坚强，应该振作起来，向各种困难斗争。
    第二天早上，高君诰又走向工地了。经过许多次试验，她最后还是克服了各种技术上的困难，“快硬性混凝土”试验成功了。
    试验报告单是在十一月的一个星期六晚上送回来的。高君诰一见报告单，马上就冲进经理办公室去，大声说：“杨经理，你看这个强度多好啊！”
    “好！我们正在发愁的事解决了！你知道吗？原来决定大量采用电热法，因为没有足够的变压器，就停止了。现在有了新方法，没有变压器也能按时供应大批预制构件了。”经理高兴地说。
    高君诰又跑去报告党总支书记、总工程师，他们都衷心地祝贺她试验成功。还到什么地方去呢？她实在一个人呆不住，马上又冲进正在举行的周末舞会，兴高采烈地随着音乐旋转起来。
    公司立即在各工地推广“快硬性混凝土”。使用的结果是：它使混凝土工程的建设速度比电热法提高四倍以上，最后的强度也比用电热法的高。同时它能在零下二十度的气候可以不用电热法进行冬季施工，每方混凝土最少能降低成本九元八角多。武汉、兰州、唐山等地的工程单位从报上看到这个消息后，马上就派了成批的技术人员到太原学习这项经验。远在云南、黑龙江的工程单位也写信来索取技术资料。高君诰也收到许多来自祖国各地和志愿军的热情的信。
    深夜，她还兴奋的睡不着。她要把自己的快乐写在日记本上。她第一句就写道：“亲爱的妈妈呀，我真太高兴了！从来也没有这样高兴过。我知道试验已经成功了。我为祖国作出了一点成绩……在今后的工作中，我一定要向全国劳动模范看齐，向优秀的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子看齐。”（附图片）
