Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 12th: Phnom Penh dispatch: According to the "Mekong Daily" on April 7th, Cambodian former Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sihanouk delivered a speech at the People's Socialist Community conference held in Kampot on April 6th. He spoke about the pressure Cambodia is currently under from foreign governments and his views on maintaining Cambodia's neutrality.

Those attending the conference included Cambodian Prime Minister Khim Tit, government ministers, Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Sang Nhean, and over one thousand people from Kampot.

Sihanouk said that, as everyone knows, Cambodia has now reached a crossroads. The pressure exerted by imperialism on our neutrality is the difficulty we are suffering.

In Prey Veng, Phnom Penh, and other places, compatriots are filled with righteous indignation, and demonstrations have occurred one after another, expressing their support for the government's neutral policy. The motives of these demonstrators are correct, because they have seen the following facts with their own eyes: (1) The Cambodian nation is already facing a major crisis. (2) Foreign countries are strangling Cambodia's economy, South Vietnam and Thailand are blockading Cambodia's economy, and the United States is unwilling to sympathize with Cambodia. It is precisely these two difficulties that are the main factors that caused me to resign.

Sihanouk said that Cambodia's adoption of neutrality is due to the will of the people, which is well known. Now some countries, because of our achievements in neutral and peaceful policies, have taken actions to strangle Cambodia's economy. Because they brought us strangling actions that almost killed us, they aroused anti-American movements among our compatriots. Compatriots told me: "Reject American aid! We, the people, are willing to pay taxes to make up for the national treasury's expenditures." Some civil servants also demanded that American aid be rejected, and they expressed their willingness to voluntarily reduce their salaries to contribute to the country.

Cambodia's adoption of neutrality is resented by the United States, which ignores that Cambodia had already decided to pursue a neutral policy at the Bandung Conference, and twenty-eight Asian and African countries were witnesses; Cambodia also reiterated at that time that it needed the friendship of all countries that treated it equally. We have also established this friendship with Japan and People's China.

The route I took will also have an impact on neighboring Thailand. A Thai member of parliament questioned Luang Phibunsongkhram, saying: "Thailand is a larger country than Cambodia, why can't we follow Sihanouk's political route? Why join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, making Thailand's military spending huge?" Similar incidents also occurred in Manila, with Philippine parliamentarians questioning the government why it didn't adopt neutrality. After this series of events, Cambodia began to be subjected to pressure, and this pressure became apparent after my visit to Beijing. However, in any case, an independent country does not accept foreign interference in its diplomatic autonomy, and at the same time, a country has absolutely no reason to carry out such interference.

Sihanouk pointed out that the reason he talked about these issues was to make people further understand the situation, so as to jointly seek appropriate solutions and concentrate efforts to break through the difficulties in front of them. These difficulties are dealing with the economic blockade issue, the issue of Thailand's occupation of Cambodian territory, the issue of Thailand's blockade of Cambodia's borders, and the issue of the conditions of American aid.

He said: The Cambodian territory in Kampong Thom province occupied by Thailand, the Thai side has declared a "state of tension" in the area, which is a measure of a country preparing to declare war on a neighboring country. After this "state of tension" is promulgated, if Cambodian residents stray into this area of their own territory, they will be immediately shot dead by the Thai army.

Sihanouk then said: The United States announced that it would not provide aid to Cambodia in US dollars, but only in Cambodian currency. The governor of the National Bank advised against accepting this type of aid. We should be self-sufficient, because when begging for aid from others, the money is theirs, and the right to give it is in their hands. And the ultimate goal of the United States in aiding any country is to have the recipient country carry out anti-communism. The United States is afraid that Cambodia's policy will affect the anti-communist sentiment of South Vietnam and Thailand, so it believes that I am not democratic enough, and that my regime was obtained through murder and arson. The Americans also think that Ngo Dinh Diem's violation of the Geneva Accords is a democratic style! The United States also said that Sihanouk's return of power to the people is "dictatorial," while the provision that the ruling party must occupy half of the seats in the Thai parliament is "democratic." The United States scolded me as a crazy person, this sentence came from a country that boasts of being democratic, I don't know what qualifications it has to scold people.

In fact, the United States is dissatisfied with Cambodia's failure to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The Cambodian people believe that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a military group, and joining it would be a violation of the Geneva Accords. Our decision is absolutely correct, because if we don't do this, we are in danger. In order for Cambodia not to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Mr. Zhou Enlai and I became close friends. Although I do not blame the United States, I believe that the United States' method of preventing communism is to call on others to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Conversely, my method of preventing communism is not to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. We should understand that strong countries have the strategies of strong countries, and small countries also have their own routes, and this is a matter of choosing what they like. I have resigned from my position as Cambodia's chief representative to the United Nations. I don't want to go to the United States because that country judges me to be a crazy person. I would rather go to countries that don't think I'm crazy, such as People's China. But I am not telling my compatriots to hate Americans along with me, I just want them to solve the relationship with the United States themselves.

In Phnom Penh, some tricycle drivers wanted to beat up Americans. I advised them to calm down and wait until the problem is reasonably resolved, and not to ruin a big plan for a small impatience.

Cambodians are unwilling to make unnecessary sacrifices for others, to repeat the tragedy of the Cambodian people when France and the "Viet Minh" fought in the past. At that time, some Cambodians died for the "Viet Minh," and others sacrificed for France. This is enough to prove that we must unite, and unity is strength.

Sihanouk finally said: In any case, although Cambodia wants American aid, its attitude towards the United States is not as good as other anti-communist countries. Because Cambodia does not obey their instigation. Now we are discussing the issue of American aid. If we reject it, do we have a way to make up for the national treasury's expenditures? If we say yes, we can only do the following: (1) Quickly prevent smuggling and increase national treasury revenue. (2) Accept economic assistance from People's China. (3) India also expressed dissatisfaction when Cambodia was under pressure this time and is willing to assist Cambodia. (4) Build the Yunrang port early, so that our national economy will not be strangled.

Finally, I put forward the following three decisions to deal with the current difficulties: (1) The people allow me to temporarily resign from the position of prime minister, so that the new cabinet can deal with the United States, South Vietnam, and Thailand. Since I have become their mortal enemy, I certainly disdain to take American aid. An independent country should also try to make its economy independent. (2) Establish normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, because the two major powers have set up embassies in Phnom Penh, and under mutual contradictions, Cambodia's position is becoming increasingly strong. (3) Complete the two-year plan to revitalize the national economy.

At the same time, I feel that Cambodia's policy towards the United States should be changed, because we are a Buddhist country and deeply believe in "good is rewarded with good, and evil with evil," but the Americans repay kindness with enmity. When the next United Nations General Assembly is held, we will decide to support the admission of People's China to the United Nations, because Cambodia is only neutral and is under pressure, while Britain has established diplomatic relations with China but does not dare to ask about it. Isn't this seeing through that Cambodia is a small country and can be bullied?

The points raised by Sihanouk in his speech were adopted as resolutions of the meeting.

    在柬埔寨人民社会同盟会议上
    西哈努克抨击美国干涉柬埔寨内外政策
    新华社河内12日电　金边消息：据“湄江日报”四月七日报道，柬埔寨王国前首相西哈努克亲王四月六日在唝吥举行的人民社会同盟的会议上发表了演说，他谈到了柬埔寨目前所受的外国政府的压力以及他对维护柬埔寨中立的意见。
    出席这次会议的有柬埔寨王国首相钦·迪、各部大臣、王国会议副议长桑·年等和唝吥人民一千多人。
    西哈努克说，众所周知，柬埔寨现在已经踏上十字路口。帝国主义对我们的中立所施的压力，就是我们所遭受的困难。
    在波萝勉、金边各地，同胞们群情激昂，相继发生示威运动，以表示他们支持政府所采取的中立政策。这些示威者的动机是正确的，因为他们亲眼看见了下面的事实：（一）柬埔寨民族已经面临一个大危机。（二）外国扼杀柬埔寨经济，南越、泰国封锁柬埔寨经济；同时美国也不愿意同情柬埔寨。正因为这两点困难，造成了我辞职的主要因素。
    西哈努克说，柬埔寨的采取中立是由于民意，这是众所周知的事。现在一些国家，因为我们在中立和平政策上得到了成就，所以做出了扼杀柬埔寨经济的行动。由于他们带来几乎使我们致死的扼杀行动，激起了我们同胞们的反美运动。同胞们告诉我说：“拒绝接受美援吧！我们做人民的愿意纳税去弥补国库支出。”一些公务员也要求拒绝美援，他们表示自动要求削减薪金贡献国家。
    柬埔寨的采取中立受到美国的仇视，它忽略了柬埔寨在万隆会议上已经决定奉行中立政策，并且有二十八个亚非国家作证人；柬埔寨还在那个时候就重申，需要所有平等相待的国家的友谊。我们并且同日本和人民中国建立了这种友谊。
    我所采取的路线，对毗邻的泰国也会引起影响，一位泰国议员质问銮披汶先生说：“泰国是比柬埔寨大的国家，我们为什么不能效法西哈努克的政治路线呢？为什么要参加东南亚条约组织，使泰国军费开支浩大呢？”在马尼拉也发生了类似事件，菲律宾议员质问政府为什么不采取中立。这一连串事件发生后，柬埔寨就开始受到压力，等到我访问北京归来后，这种压力就表面化了。但是，无论如何，一个独立的国家是不接受外人干预它的外交自主权的，同时，一个国家也绝无理由去执行这种干预。
    西哈努克指出，他所以谈这些问题，是要人们进一步明了局势，以便共同寻求妥善办法，集中力量去打破摆在眼前的难关。这些困难是对付经济封锁问题，泰国侵占柬埔寨领土问题，泰国对柬埔寨封锁边界问题和美国援助的条件问题。
    他说：被泰国占领的柬埔寨磅通省属领土，泰方在该区宣布进入“紧张状态”，这是一个国家准备与邻国宣战的措施。在这“紧张状态”颁布后，倘若柬埔寨居民迷途跑到这个自己国土的地区，立即会被泰军击毙的。
    西哈努克接着说：美国宣布不以美元援助柬埔寨，只给予柬埔寨币的援助。这种援助方式，国家银行行长建议拒绝。我们应该自量些，因为向人家乞援，钱是别人的，舍给之权握在别人手里，而美国援助任何国家，最终目的是要受援国家去进行反共。美国恐怕柬埔寨政策会影响了南越和泰国的反共情绪，所以认为我不够民主，认为我的政权是从杀人放火得来的。美国人同时认为吴庭艳的违反日内瓦协定是民主作风哩！美国还说，西哈努克的还政于民是“独裁”，而泰国国会的组成必需有执政党占半数席位的规定是“民主”。美国骂我是疯狂的人，这句话出自一个以民主自诩的国家，我不知道它凭什么资格骂人。
    其实，美国是不满意柬埔寨不加入东南亚条约组织。柬埔寨人民认为，东南亚条约组织是军事集团，一旦加入便是违反日内瓦协定。我们这种决策是绝对正确的，因为不这样做，我们是危险的。为了柬埔寨不加入东南亚条约组织，我和周恩来先生变成了密友。虽然我不责难美国，但我认为美国的防共办法是叫别人加入东南亚条约组织，相反地，我的防共办法却是不加入东南亚条约组织。我们应该明白，强国有强国的策略，小国也自有小国的路线，这是各择其喜而行的。我已辞去柬埔寨王国驻联合国首席代表的职务，我不愿到美国去，因为那个国家判定我是一个疯狂的人。我宁愿去那些不认为我是个疯子的国家去，例如人民中国。但我并不是叫我的同胞们跟着我去憎恨美国人，我只要他们自行解决与美国的关系。
    在金边，有一部分三轮车夫要殴打美国人，我劝他们平心静气些，等到这个问题合理解决，不要小不忍而乱大谋。
    柬埔寨人不愿意为他人作无谓牺牲，以重演过去法国和“越盟”打仗时柬埔寨人民的悲剧，那时候一些柬埔寨人为“越盟”而死，另一些人为法国而牺牲，这足以证明我们还要团结，团结才是力量。
    西哈努克最后说：无论如何，柬埔寨虽然要美援，但对美国的态度是不如其他反共国家的。因为柬埔寨不服从他们的唆使。现在讨论美援问题，如果我们拒绝它、我们有办法弥补国库支出吗？如果说有，只有这样做：（一）赶紧防止走私，增加国库收入。（二）接受人民中国经济援助。（三）印度在这次柬埔寨受到压力的时候也表示不满，愿意援助柬埔寨。（四）提早建筑云壤港口，使我们的国家经济不致被扼杀。
    最后，我提出以下三点决策，来应付现在的困难：（一）人民准我暂辞首相职务，使新内阁与美国、南越、泰国周旋。因为我既然成了他们的死敌，当然不屑去拿美援。一个独立国家也应该设法使经济独立。（二）和苏联建立正常邦交，因为两个强国都在金边设使馆，在互相矛盾之下，柬埔寨地位日益坚固。（三）完成二年计划，振兴国家经济。
    同时，我觉得柬埔寨对美国的政策应该改变，因为我们是佛教国家，深信“善恶有报”，但美国人却恩将仇报。我们在下届联合国大会开会的时候决定支持人民中国加入联合国，因为柬埔寨仅仅中立而受到压力，而英国同中国建立邦交却不敢过问，这岂不是看穿柬埔寨是小国而可欺吗？
    西哈努克在演说中所提各点被作为会议的决议通过。
