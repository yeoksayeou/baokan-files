    Opposing Britain's Connivance with Actions Undermining the Geneva Accords

    The Ngo Dinh Diem government of South Vietnam, with the consistent support of the United States, once again publicly declared on April 6 its "refusal to recognize" the provisions of the Geneva Accords. When the French side decided to withdraw its troops stationed in South Vietnam on April 28th of this year, it did not make the necessary arrangements to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords in South Vietnam in the future. How to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam has obviously become a more pressing issue that needs to be resolved. However, at this time, Britain, as one of the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, openly stated that South Vietnam is not legally obligated to abide by the Geneva Accords' provisions regarding holding free nationwide elections in Vietnam. People cannot but strongly condemn this act of conniving with the undermining of the Geneva Accords.

    South Vietnam is one of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference. When the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union forces in Indochina signed the Vietnam Armistice Agreement, he represented not only France but also South Vietnam. The Geneva Accords also clearly stipulate that the successor of the French Union forces in South Vietnam must abide by and implement all the terms of the agreement. The claim that South Vietnam has no obligation to comply with the Geneva Accords is completely untenable. As Prime Minister Nehru pointed out, South Vietnam has accepted and continues to enjoy all the benefits of the Geneva Accords, and it must, of course, bear the various obligations stipulated by the agreement. Prime Minister Nehru repeatedly emphasized that "the South Vietnamese government is fully bound by the Geneva Accords," which is completely correct and just.

    According to the Geneva Accords, all participating countries of the Geneva Conference have the responsibility to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords. Even the United States is no exception. The U.S. government has formally declared that it will not undermine the Geneva Accords. But in fact, it has been working with the Ngo Dinh Diem government to create the excuse that South Vietnam is not bound by the Geneva Accords and has taken various measures to undermine the Geneva Accords. This is an illegal act of seriously betraying international obligations. As one of the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Britain has an inescapable responsibility to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords. However, not only does it not condemn this illegal act by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem government, but it also echoes their absurd arguments, attempting to legitimize their illegal behavior. Is this the minimum fair attitude that one of the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference should have? Agreements must be jointly observed by all parties concerned, which is one of the oldest principles of international law. If South Vietnam can be unbound by the Geneva Accords, then what legal basis is there for the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam? The Geneva Accords are a whole, and the provisions regarding free elections throughout Vietnam are an indivisible part of it. If South Vietnam can legally refuse to comply with this fundamental provision of the Geneva Accords, then what guarantee is there for peace in the whole of Vietnam and Indochina? As many newspapers in India have pointed out, the British government's support for the absurd arguments of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem government is an attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords.

    In order to cover up its connivance with the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem government's actions to undermine the Geneva Accords, Britain has even slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for conducting "large-scale military expansion." In fact, since the armistice, the Vietnam People's Army has demobilized 50,000 soldiers. The various reports of the International Commission also fully show that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently strictly abided by the Geneva Accords. Conversely, in South Vietnam, the United States has been stepping up the training and equipping of the South Vietnamese army. The Vietnam International Commission clearly pointed out in its recent Fifth Working Report that U.S. military aircraft often enter Saigon Airport without reporting to the International Commission. The International Commission also requested that this be corrected. The British government remains silent on the accusations clearly made by the International Commission, but instead slanders the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Is this also a fair attitude that one of the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference should have? The British government says repeatedly: "It is extremely important to maintain peace between North and South Vietnam at present." Is it beneficial to maintaining peace in Vietnam to condone the illegal actions of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem government to undermine the Geneva Accords?

    The current situation in Vietnam is serious. All relevant countries should earnestly take responsibility to stop actions that undermine the Geneva Accords. The representatives of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference are continuing to discuss the Vietnam issue in London. People have reason to demand that Britain adopt a fair stance, faithfully fulfill its responsibilities as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and take all necessary measures with the Soviet Union, in particular, to reconvene the Geneva Conference to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and consolidate peace in Indochina.

### 反对英国纵容破坏日内瓦协议的行为

    反对英国纵容破坏日内瓦协议的行为
    南越吴庭艳政府，在美国的一贯支持下，四月六日又一次公开宣称，“拒绝承认”日内瓦协议的规定。法国方面在决定将在今年四月二十八日撤出它驻南越军队时，对于今后保证在南越履行日内瓦协议，也没有作出必要的安排。如何保证日内瓦协议在越南的实施，显然已经成为更加迫切需要解决的问题。但是，正在这个时候，作为日内瓦会议主席国之一的英国，却公然表示，南越在法律上没有义务遵守日内瓦协议关于举行越南全国自由选举的规定。对于这种纵容破坏日内瓦协议的行为，人们不能不予以强烈的谴责。
    南越是日内瓦会议参加国之一。当驻印度支那法兰西联邦军总司令部在越南停战协定上签字时，它不但代表法国，而且也代表南越。日内瓦协议中还明确地规定，法兰西联邦军在南越的继承人，必须遵守和实施协议的各项条款。所谓南越没有义务遵守日内瓦协议的说法，是完全不能成立的。正如尼赫鲁总理所指出，南越已经接受了并且正继续享受日内瓦协议的一切利益，它当然也必须承担协议所规定的各项义务。尼赫鲁总理反复强调“南越政府完全受日内瓦协议的约束”，这是完全正确和公正的。
    按照日内瓦协议，所有日内瓦会议的参加国都有责任保证日内瓦协议的实施。就是美国也不能例外。美国政府曾经正式声明它将不破坏日内瓦协议。但是事实上它却同吴庭艳政府一道，制造所谓南越不受日内瓦协议约束的借口，采取了种种破坏日内瓦协议的措施。这是严重的背弃国际义务的非法行为。作为日内瓦会议主席国之一的英国，对保证日内瓦协议的实施负有不可推诿的责任。但是它却不但不谴责美国和吴庭艳政府的这种非法行为，反而附和它们的荒谬论调，企图使它们的非法行为合法化。这难道是日内瓦会议主席国之一所应该有的最起码的公正态度吗？协议必须由有关各方共同遵守，这是最古老的国际法原则之一。如果南越可以不受日内瓦协议的约束，那么日内瓦协议在越南的实施，还有什么法律基础呢？日内瓦协议是一个整体，有关全越南自由选举的规定是它不可分割的一部分。如果说南越在法律上可以不遵守日内瓦协议的这一基本规定，那么，整个越南和印度支那的和平还有什么保证呢？正如印度的许多报纸所指出的，英国政府支持美国和吴庭艳政府的这种荒谬论调，是破坏日内瓦协议的企图。
    为了掩盖自己纵容美国和吴庭艳政府破坏日内瓦协议的行为，英国竟然诬蔑越南民主共和国进行“大规模的军事扩张”。事实上，自停战以来，越南人民军已经有五万名复员。国际委员会的历次报告也完全表明，越南民主共和国一贯严格遵守日内瓦协议。相反地，在南越方面，美国却一直在加紧训练和装备南越军队。越南国际委员会在最近所提出的第五次工作报告中，就明白指出：美国军用飞机经常不向国际委员会报告而进入西贡机场。国际委员会并且要求对此加以纠正。英国政府对国际委员会所明白提出的指责默不作声，却反而对越南民主共和国肆行诬蔑。难道这也是作为日内瓦会议主席国之一所应该有的公正态度吗？英国政府口口声声说：“目前保持越南北方和南方之间的和平是极其重要的”。难道纵容美国和吴庭艳政府破坏日内瓦协议的非法行为会有利于保持越南的和平吗？
    目前越南的局势是严重的。一切有关国家都应该切实负起责任来制止破坏日内瓦协议的行为。日内瓦会议的两位主席的代表正在伦敦继续就越南问题进行商谈。人们有理由要求英国采取公正的立场，忠实履行日内瓦会议主席之一的职责，同苏联一道采取一切必要的措施，特别是重新召开日内瓦会议，来保证日内瓦协议在越南的实施，实现越南的和平统一，巩固印度支那的和平。
