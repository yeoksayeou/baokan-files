    Alum Production Base in the Mountains

    In the mountains of southeastern Zhejiang Province, there is a mining area with very rich alum reserves – Fanshan. According to the preliminary survey conducted by the Zhejiang Geological Survey Institute in 1950, the total alum reserves in the Fanshan mining area, calculated at a daily output of 100 tons, can be mined for hundreds of years.
    Alum is a raw material used in papermaking, leather making, rubber manufacturing, dyeing, gilding, explosives manufacturing, sugar refining, fertilizer production, disinfectant production, and water purification. Fanshan alum has been mined for more than 300 years. Before liberation, Fanshan was controlled by feudal headmen and capitalists, resulting in backward production and low output. In the early days of liberation in 1949, the annual output of the entire Fanshan mining area was only over 9,000 tons.
    After liberation, under the leadership and support of the local Party organization and government, all the closed factories and mines resumed production. The production enthusiasm of workers and technicians was fully utilized. In just five years, the alum extraction rate per hundred catties of ore in large kilns increased from 18 catties to 24 catties; the average daily output per kiln increased from more than 4,000 catties to more than 7,000 catties. Last year, the state established an alum industry laboratory here, and technicians and workers successfully tested a method of washing alum bricks using alum slurry water. After the promotion of this method, the entire mining area can produce an additional nine tons of alum per day, and the milky white alum slurry water that flows along the creek can be utilized, increasing the country's wealth by more than 250,000 yuan each year. Last year, the state also built an alum plant in the Fanshan mining area with a daily output of 15 tons of alum.
    Now, nearly 40 alum refineries in the entire mining area have implemented joint public-private ownership, and more than 200 self-mining and self-selling mining work teams have also been completely reorganized, under the unified leadership of the Zhejiang Pingyang Alum Mine United Company. In this way, all factories and mines scattered around the mine are fully incorporated into the national planning track. In order to meet the needs of production development, civilian workers are building a transportation road from the mine to Chixi. After this road is completed, flatbed carts will replace civilian workers in carrying alum, and it is estimated that transportation efficiency can be increased by four times, saving more than 300,000 yuan in transportation costs each year. In the future, highways will be built and motor vehicle transportation will be used.
    With the development of production, department stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, banks, Xinhua bookstores, post and telecommunications bureaus, and health clinics have been established here one after another. Before liberation, the entire mining area had only one small primary school that could accommodate more than 100 students. Now, a primary school that can accommodate more than 700 students and a Fanshan middle school that can accommodate more than 300 students have been built; more than 800 employees in the entire mining area have entered the employee spare-time school.

    丛山中的明矾产地
    今秀
    在我国浙江省东南丛山中，有一个明矾储藏量非常丰富的矿区——矾山。根据1950年浙江地质调查所的初步勘测，矾山矿区明矾的总储藏量，以日产一百吨计算，可以开采数百年。
    明矾是造纸、制革、造橡胶、染色、镀金、制炸药、制糖、做肥料、做消毒药物，以及清洁饮水等所用的一种原料。矾山明矾远在三百多年前就被开采了。在解放以前，矾山被封建把头和资本家所把持，生产落后，产量很低。1949年解放初期，整个矾山矿区年产量只有九千多吨。
    解放后，在当地党组织和政府的领导和扶植下，以前倒闭的厂矿全部恢复了生产，工人和技术人员的生产积极性得到充分的发挥，在短短的五年中，大型窑平均每百斤矿石的出矾率，就由十八斤提高到二十四斤；平均每窑日产量从四千多斤提高到七千多斤。去年，国家在这里设立了一个明矾工业试验室，技术人员和工人试验成功了一种利用矾浆水洗矾砖的办法。这个办法推广以后，可使全矿区每天多生产九吨明矾，并且使顺着小溪流走的乳白色的矾浆水得到利用，每年可以为国家增加二十五万多元的财富。去年，国家又在矾山矿区兴建了一座日产十五吨明矾的矾厂。
    现在，全矿区将近四十个炼矾厂都实行了公私合营，二百多个自采自卖的矿山开采工作班，也实行了全面改组，由浙江平阳明矾厂矿联合公司统一领导。这样，分散在矿山周围所有厂矿，就全部纳入了国家计划轨道。为了适应生产发展的需要，民工们正在为矿山修建一条从矿山到赤溪的运输道路。这条路修好后，将由平车来代替民工挑运明矾，估计运输效率可以提高四倍，每年可节省运输费三十多万元。将来还要修公路改用汽车运输。
    随着生产的发展，百货公司、供销合作社、银行、新华书店、邮电局、保健院都在这里相继建立起来了。解放前，全矿区只有一所可容一百多个学生的小学。现在，已经建了一所可容七百多名学生的小学，和一所可容三百多名学生的矾山中学；全矿区有八百多名职工进入了职工业余学校。
