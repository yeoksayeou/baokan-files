    The Fighting Mexican Prints
    Li Qun
    The 273 pieces of Mexican print art displayed at the Beijing "Art Exhibition Hall" are full of fighting spirit: they are pictures of the struggle to defend world peace, the struggle for Mexican national independence, and the struggle for the liberation of the working people. They praise peace and oppose wars of aggression; they praise revolutionary heroes who dedicate themselves to national liberation and oppose colonialists. These pictures, which express the voice of the people with sincere feelings, these pictures, which interweave internationalism and patriotism, deeply move us and arouse our infinite sympathy for the Mexican people.
    The prints of Mexican artists are rich and diverse. For the needs of struggle and propaganda, they have not only created general painting-style prints, but also prints combined with cartoons and posters, as well as prints specially created for book illustrations and magazine covers. This richness and diversity is also reflected in the subject matter. But no matter what form of expression or what subject matter they use, we feel that the works are closely integrated with the people's political movement, faithfully serve the revolutionary interests of the people, and always stay true to the characteristics of print art.
    The prints of Mexican artists have obvious national characteristics and obvious artistic creativity. The reason why they can create such successful prints is first of all because they have close ties with the lives of the people. They are very concerned about the fate of their motherland and the people. They share joys and sorrows with the people, are good at understanding the sufferings and wishes of the people, and always regard art as a weapon of struggle for serving politics. At the same time, they can firmly grasp the essence of life, and are good at generalizing, concentrating, and emphasizing, expressing the real life and vivid images of the people, and therefore are warmly welcomed by readers.
    All the exhibited prints are provided by the Mexican "Popular Graphics Workshop." This art group was founded in 1937. For nearly twenty years, it has not only had a great influence in Mexico, but also in other countries in Latin America. Because of its great contribution to the cause of defending peace, the World Peace Council awarded the leader of this art group, Leopoldo Méndez, and his comrades the International Peace Prize in 1952.
    Leopoldo Méndez came from a shoemaker's family, and his mother was a rural woman. His life is very simple. He has extremely deep national feelings. He is a realistic artist who is loyal to Mexican traditions, with a strong character and outstanding talent. Each of his paintings is carefully conceived and made. His woodcut "The Brutality of the Landlords" exhibited at this exhibition depicts the brutal scene of Mexican landlords burying peasants alive. The lower body of the victim is buried in the soil, and only the upper body above the ground is still struggling in pain. Over there, another peasant is being dragged away by thugs to be buried alive. The brutal landlords are grinning leisurely beside them. This is the vicious method used by Mexican exploiters to treat peasants. However, the victim does not give in, and his heart is burning with the flames of revenge. This is a powerful accusation made by the author for the Mexican people. His woodcut "Better to Die Unyielding," made for the film "The Days of Life," is equally touching. The painting depicts the image of a hero who is unyielding in the face of adversity and regards death as going home. In the background are countless masses of people blocked by the police. The hero feels honored to be martyred for the masses of people, and the people give him strength, so he can appear so calm when several gun muzzles are pointing at his chest at the same time. The above two woodcuts express different artistic effects with different pictures and different characters. The former evokes more of our sympathy for the victims, while the latter evokes more of our lofty respect for the hero. Méndez's "Mourning Those Who Died in the Struggle Against Fascism" and "Menéndez Was Killed" are both works with a very serious atmosphere and expressing the deep mourning of the living for the dead. The expressive techniques of these two woodcuts are more concentrated and concise, and what they want to emphasize is more prominent, and at the same time they are more characteristic of woodcuts. Méndez's "The First Lesson of the Revolution" is also a thought-provoking work. It expresses the people's admiration and love for the revolutionary leader through the scene of a mother telling her two children about the life of the national hero Juárez in a family.
    Another printmaker who has shown his special talent in the exhibition is Alberto Beltrán. His woodcut "People Being Trafficked" left a deep impression on us. The picture depicts a clear contrast between two opposing classes. Those innocent people are driven onto the train like cattle and horses, and their fate is conceivable. From the tall man who reveals his facial expression, you can see the anger in his heart. And the slave owner standing there, although only the back is visible, is very hateful. His other poster-style woodcut "You Are Surrounded by Illiterates" expresses the people's urgent need for culture and the intellectuals' sense of responsibility for literacy work. His "Sino-Soviet Friendship" depicts the sincere friendship between the Soviet and Mexican people. This composition has two different forms of prints appearing in the exhibition, one is a lithograph and the other is a woodcut (published on the cover of a magazine). They help us understand the different techniques of the painter when using the same subject matter and the same composition to express them with different tools and different forms. In addition, his "May Day" and "Maruena Sánchez" are also touching and excellent prints.
    Andrea Gómez's "Mother Against War" is a woodcut that represents the wishes and will of mothers all over the world. For the peace of all mankind and for the happiness of all children, the mother holds her baby and appears in the picture as a strong warrior defending peace. Her image powerfully encourages people to fight against war.
    The work "The Fugitive" by the young artist Arturo García Bustos depicts a Mexican people's hero fleeing in the forest. His right arm is injured, and he is standing in the water, watching the enemies tracking him from afar, preparing for the upcoming battle. The enemies are using police dogs as guides to explore and search. The quiet forest is suddenly filled with tense air. The authenticity of the work is touching, and its tendency is obvious.
    Elizabeth Catlett's linocut poster "Save the Surviving Children" and the cartoon-style woodcut "Struggle to Defend the Rights of Black People" are both noteworthy and outstanding prints. The former is a moving poster, depicting children lying in their mother's arms who are in urgent need of rescue. The latter depicts a black child who was almost murdered and is already being rescued. The image of this child is very lovely, and he has a power to attract the audience to support him in obtaining the human rights he should enjoy.
    In addition, the outstanding printmaker and muralist Pablo O'Higgins's vivid works about peasant life show his familiarity with peasant life and his deep feelings for the peasants. These works also left a deep impression on us.
    In this "Mexican Print Exhibition," a total of works by more than 30 printmakers from the "Popular Graphics Workshop" are exhibited. There are many good prints among them, and I cannot mention them all here. As a Chinese printmaker, I am very happy to see such outstanding Mexican prints. The fighting spirit and heroic images of the Mexican people expressed through these prints make us believe that the days of real happiness for the Mexican people will come soon. (Attached pictures)

    战斗的墨西哥版画
    力群
    陈列在北京“美术展览馆”的273幅墨西哥的版画艺术，是富有战斗性的：它们是为保卫世界和平而斗争、为墨西哥的民族独立而斗争、为劳动人民的解放而斗争的图画。它们歌颂和平，反对侵略战争；歌颂为民族解放而献身的革命英雄，反对殖民主义者。这些以真挚的感情表现了人民的呼声的图画，这些交织着国际主义和爱国主义的图画，深深地感动着我们，引起我们对墨西哥人民无限的同情。
    墨西哥艺术家们的这些版画，是丰富多样的，他们为了斗争和宣传的需要，不仅创作了一般绘画式的版画，而且还创作了同漫画、招贴画相结合的版画，以及专为书籍的插图和杂志的封面而创作的版画。这种丰富多样也表现在取材方面。但是不论他们用了怎样的表现形式和怎样的题材，都使我们感到作品是和人民的政治运动紧密结合着的，是为人民的革命利益忠实服务的，并且是始终不脱离版画艺术的特点的。
    墨西哥艺术家们的版画，是有着显明的民族特色和显明的艺术创造性的。他们所以能创作出这样成功的版画，首先由于他们和人民的生活有着密切的联系，他们十分关心祖国和人民的命运，他们和人民共欢乐，共甘苦，善于体会人民的疾苦和心愿，始终把艺术看作是为政治服务的一种斗争武器。同时能够紧紧地抓住生活的本质，善于概括、集中、强调，表现了人民的真实生活和生动的形象，因而受到了读者的热烈欢迎。
    展出的全部版画作品是由墨西哥“通俗图画社”供给的。这个艺术团体成立于1937年，将近二十年来，它不仅在墨西哥本国具有很大的影响，而且在拉丁美洲的其他国家里也有很大的影响。由于它对于保卫和平的事业的巨大贡献，所以世界和平理事会曾于1952年颁发给这个艺术团体的领导者利奥波多·孟德斯和他的同志们以国际和平奖金。
    利奥波多·孟德斯出身于一个鞋匠的家庭，母亲是农村妇女。他的生活是很简朴的，他有着极其深厚的民族情感，他是一位忠实于墨西哥传统的现实主义的艺术家，有着坚强的性格和卓越的天才，他的每一幅画都是经过精心细致的构思而作成的。在这个展览会上展出的他的木刻画“地主的残暴”，描绘了墨西哥地主活埋农民的残暴情景。受难者的下身被埋在土中，只露出地面的上身还在痛苦地挣扎。那边另一个农民，也正被狗腿们拉去活埋。残暴的地主们在旁悠闲地狞笑着。这就是墨西哥剥削者对待农民的毒辣手段。然而受难者并不屈服，他的内心在燃烧着复仇的火焰。这是作者为墨西哥人民提出的有力控诉。他为影片“生活的日子”而作的木刻画“宁死不屈”也同样是很感动人的。画中所塑造的是一位临难不屈、视死如归的英雄的形象，背景是被警察拦住的无数的人民群众。英雄为人民群众而就义感到光荣，人民给他以力量，所以他能在几枝枪口同时指向他的胸膛时表现得如此从容。以上两幅木刻以不同的画面和不同的人物性格表达了不一样的艺术效果，前者更多地引起了我们对于受难者的同情，而后者则更多地引起了我们给予英雄以崇高的敬意。孟德斯的“哀悼那些在反对法西斯主义斗争中牺牲的人们”和“梅宁德斯被杀害了”，都是有着十分严肃的气氛和表现了生者对于死者的沉痛哀悼的作品，这两幅木刻的表现手法更集中、更简炼，所要强调的也更突出，同时也更具备木刻的特色。孟德斯的“革命的第一课”也是一幅引人注意的作品，它通过在一个家庭里母亲给两个子女讲述民族英雄胡阿列士的生平的情景，表现了人民对于革命领袖的敬仰和爱戴。
    在展览作品中表现了自己的特殊才能的另一位版画家是阿利别尔托·别利特兰，他的木刻画“被贩卖的人们”给我们留下了深刻的印象。画面描绘了两个敌对阶级的显明的对照，那些无辜的人群，像牛马似的被赶上火车，他们的命运是可想而知的。从那个显露着面部表情的高个子男人身上，可以看出他内心的愤怒。而那个站着的奴隶主，虽然只见背影，却令人感到十分憎恨。他的另一幅招贴式的木刻画“你的周围都是文盲”，表现了人民群众要求文化的迫切和知识分子对于扫盲工作的责任感。他的“墨苏友好”描绘了苏联人民和墨西哥人民的真挚的友谊，这一构图有两幅不同形式的版画出现在展览会上，一幅是石版画，另一幅是木刻画（发表在一个杂志的封面上），它们有助于我们了解画家以同一题材、同一构图，在运用不同工具和不同形式来表现时的不同技法。此外，他的“五一劳动节”和“玛鲁埃娜·桑切斯”也都是感人的优秀的版画作品。
    安德列阿·戈麦士的“母亲反对战争”是一幅代表了全世界母亲们的心愿和意志的木刻画。为了全人类的和平，为了一切孩子们的幸福，母亲抱着幼儿，以保卫和平的坚强的战士的姿态出现在画面上，她的形象有力地鼓舞着人们为反对战争而奋斗。
    青年艺术家阿尔图罗·卡尔西阿·布斯托斯的作品“逃亡者”，描绘一个墨西哥人民的英雄逃亡在森林中，他右臂受伤，站在水中，注视着远处跟踪而来的敌人，准备着即将到来的战斗。敌人正在以警犬为先导，探步追寻，平静的森林顿时充满了紧张的空气。作品的真实性是感人的，它的倾向性是显明的。
    艾里沙别特·卡特列特用麻胶版刻的招贴画“拯救那些幸存的孩子们”以及用木刻制成的漫画式的作品“为维护黑人的权利而斗争”，都是引人注意的出色的版画。前者是一幅动人的招贴画，它表现了急待拯救的躺在母亲怀中的儿童，后者表现了已经有人在拯救的差一点就要被谋害的黑人孩子，这个孩子的形象塑造得很可爱，他有一种力量吸引观众支持他获得应该享有的人的权利。
    此外，杰出的版画家、壁画家巴布洛·奥希金斯的那些生动的关于农民生活的作品，说明他对于农民生活的熟悉和对农民的深厚感情。这些作品也给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    在这个“墨西哥版画展览会”中，一共展出了“通俗图画社”的三十多位版画家的作品，其中好的版画是很多的，我这里不能一一提到。作为一个中国的版画家，能看到墨西哥的这样杰出的版画是十分高兴的，通过这些版画所表现的墨西哥人民的战斗精神和英雄形象，使我们确信墨西哥人民的真正幸福的日子将会很快到来。（附图片）
