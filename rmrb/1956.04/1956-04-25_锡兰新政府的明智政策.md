    The Wise Policies of the New Government of Ceylon

    At the opening ceremony of the new Ceylonese Parliament on April 20, the Governor-General of Ceylon, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, outlined the policies of the new government of Ceylon in his opening address. Regarding foreign policy, the new government of Ceylon stated that it would strive to safeguard and strengthen the country's independent sovereignty. Goonetilleke pointed out that the Ceylonese government would study the status of British military bases in Ceylon, that Ceylon would not participate in any major power bloc, and that it would consider exchanging diplomatic representatives with countries with which Ceylon currently does not have diplomatic representation.

    This foreign policy of the new government of Ceylon is consistent with the propositions put forward by the People's United Front led by Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike during the parliamentary elections. The People's United Front's election platform stipulated that Ceylon should be declared a republic, refuse to participate in military blocs, abolish foreign military bases in Ceylon, implement a neutral foreign policy, and establish diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. Because this platform conformed to the national interests of Ceylon and the desire of the Ceylonese people to implement a completely independent policy, the People's United Front received the support of voters in the general election and became the majority party in parliament, allowing it to form a new government. The policy now announced by the Ceylonese government is the fulfillment of the promises it made to voters during the election, and will therefore certainly receive the support of the Ceylonese people.

    It is entirely understandable that the Ceylonese people urgently demand the abolition of foreign military bases in Ceylon and resolutely refuse to participate in military blocs. The people of Ceylon have long been subjected to colonial oppression, and only in 1948 did they break free from the direct control of British colonialism. However, Britain still maintains military bases in Ceylon and stations British troops there, which is clearly a serious obstacle to Ceylon's independent development and harms Ceylon's national sovereignty. In the struggle against colonialism and for national independence, the Ceylonese people have also realized that participating in military blocs is of no benefit to Ceylon and will only bring it new national disasters. Therefore, the new government of Ceylon has wisely decided to adopt a neutral policy and not form alliances with any major power blocs. This is clearly a very correct approach to safeguarding national sovereignty and promoting the independent development of Ceylon.

    Prime Minister Bandaranaike's recent statement that Ceylon "hopes to be the Switzerland of Asia" clearly reflects the Ceylonese people's ardent desire for peace and the implementation of a neutral policy. As long as the people of Ceylon persist in fighting to realize their ideals, there is no reason why this good wish of the Ceylonese people cannot be realized.

    Many countries in Asia and Africa, after shaking off the shackles of colonialism and embarking on the road of independent development, have adhered to an independent policy of peace and neutrality, and have established and developed friendly relations with all countries. This has not only promoted the independent development of their domestic economic construction, but also continuously raised their international status. The policies announced by the new government of Ceylon are in line with the common aspirations of the Asian and African peoples for eradic

### 锡兰新政府的明智政策

    锡兰新政府的明智政策
    在锡兰新国会四月二十日举行的开幕典礼上，锡兰总督奥利弗·古涅狄莱克在开幕词中概述了锡兰新政府的政策。在对外政策方面，锡兰新政府表示将努力维护和加强国家的独立主权。古涅狄莱克指出，锡兰政府对英国在锡兰的军事基地的地位将要加以研究，锡兰将不使自己参加任何大国集团，并将考虑同锡兰目前还没有派遣外交代表的国家交换外交代表。
    锡兰新政府的这个对外政策，是同锡兰总理班达拉奈克领导的人民联合阵线在国会选举期间提出的主张一致的。人民联合阵线的竞选纲领中规定，要宣布锡兰为共和国，拒绝参加军事集团，撤销在锡兰的外国军事基地，实行中立的外交政策，同中国和苏联建立外交关系。由于这个纲领符合锡兰的民族利益和锡兰人民要求实行完全独立的政策的愿望，人民联合阵线在大选中得到了选民的支持，而成为国会中的多数党，并得以组织新的政府。现在锡兰政府宣布的政策，就是实践它在大选期间向选民所作的诺言，因此肯定地将会得到锡兰人民的支持。
    锡兰人民迫切要求撤销外国在锡兰的军事基地，并坚决拒绝参加军事集团，是完全可以理解的。锡兰人民曾经长期受到殖民主义压迫，到1948年才摆脱了英国殖民主义的直接控制。但是，英国至今仍旧在锡兰保持军事基地和驻扎英国军队，这对锡兰的独立发展显然是严重障碍，损害了锡兰的国家主权。锡兰人民在反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争中，同样认识到参加军事集团对锡兰没有任何好处，只会给它带来新的民族灾难。因此，锡兰新政府明智地决定采取中立政策，不同任何大国集团结成联盟。这显然是维护国家主权和促进锡兰独立发展的十分正确的方针。
    班达拉奈克总理在最近的一次谈话中表示，锡兰“希望能够成为亚洲的瑞士”，就清楚地反映锡兰人民要求和平和执行中立政策的热烈愿望。只要锡兰人民坚持为实现自己的理想而斗争，锡兰人民的这种善良愿望是没有理由不能够实现的。
    亚洲和非洲许多国家在摆脱了殖民主义的枷锁而走上独立发展的道路以后，坚持实行独立的和平中立政策，同一切国家建立和发展友好关系，不但促进了它们国内经济建设的独立发展，而且在国际上的地位也不断提高。锡兰新政府所宣布的各项政策，是同目前亚非人民要求根除殖民主义残余，要求独立发展和互相团结的普遍愿望相一致的。这些政策的实施，同样将促进锡兰经济的繁荣和国际威望的增长。
    班达拉奈克总理最近说，他认为锡兰应当同中国、苏联和东欧各人民民主国家建立正常的外交关系。他说：“我想必须要做的最重要的事情就是要取消贸易壁垒。其次，东方和西方在其他方面的接触必须增加。”中国人民十分欢迎班达拉奈克总理的这种友好表示。中国人民和锡兰人民之间，一向存在着传统的融洽的友谊。我们两国从1952年以来，就在平等互利的基础上建立了良好的贸易关系。这种贸易关系一年比一年顺利的发展，事实证明这对于我们两国人民的生活都带来了很大的好处。中国人民相信，在我们两国政府和人民的共同努力下，中国和锡兰之间友好合作关系将会得到进一步发展。
