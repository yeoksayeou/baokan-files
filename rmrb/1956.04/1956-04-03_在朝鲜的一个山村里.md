    In a Mountain Village in Korea
    By Our Correspondent, Ye Yao

    As the car wound its way through the high mountains of Korea, people couldn't help but marvel at the scenery. At this time, Chinese People's Volunteer Army comrades who had spent several years in Korea would say animatedly, "This is not the most beautiful season in Korea. If you come in the summer, the azaleas will be all over the mountains and plains, blooming red and dazzling. Even people who don't usually appreciate scenery will be captivated by them." In the cold winter, this charming scenery is of course not yet visible, but you will see another charming flower—the flower of friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people.

    One day in February, around noon, some representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea arrived at Wonjik-dong, Bokman-ri, Pyeonggang County, Gangwon Province, a mountain village surrounded by mountains. The weather was particularly warm that day, the snow had melted, the roads were muddy, and the cultivated land was very soft. More than thirty households lived here, and the simple thatched houses newly built after the war were scattered at the foot of Child Peak.

    Men, women, old and young of Wonjik-dong stood on the village's main road to welcome the Chinese guests who had come from afar. Children sang "The East is Red" and "The Battle Song of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army" in Chinese, waving the flags of both China and Korea and cheering. Standing at the front were three women: Eom Jeong-seop, Choe Byeong-ban, and Choe Byeong-wol, who presented flowers to the representatives of the delegation, holding their hands tightly, speechless for a long time. In the village square, the people of Wonjik-dong held a grand gathering to welcome the Chinese guests, and these three women stood side by side at the front again. Thirty-two-year-old Eom Jeong-seop had a child on her back. The little girl had a round, rosy face and watery eyes, which were very endearing. Her mother held her back tightly with both hands, watching the Chinese guests' every move with a smile. The eyes of Choe Byeong-ban and Choe Byeong-wol, who were in their forties, were also fixed on the guests. The most beautiful emotion of mankind—internationalism—was surging in their hearts.

    It was about the events of April 17, 1953. On this day, the men of Wonjik-dong had all gone to work in the fields when suddenly, American aerial bandits arrived over Wonjik-dong and began bombing it in relays, turning the mountain village into a sea of fire. Zhang Yaoyi, a communicator from the Second Battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who was collecting firewood in the mountains, saw smoke and fire engulfing the village and rushed into the village without regard for his own safety. At this time, shrapnel and stones blown up by the explosions were flying everywhere on the hillside and in the village, and gusts of air were rolling up thick smoke and flames, burning the village. Zhang Yaoyi was determined to save the Korean people and didn't care about anything else. He first rushed into a burning house that had been bombed and collapsed, rescuing Choe Byeong-wol, who was trapped under a fallen pillar and had already fainted. Then, he rushed into the fire again. At this time, Kang Seok-ju, the labor party secretary of Bokman-ri, also rushed in with him, and together they rescued two women: one of whom was Choe Byeong-ban. Kang Seok-ju was injured in the rescue. Zhang Yaoyi bandaged Kang Seok-ju's wound, and then rescued a seven- or eight-year-old child from the fire, running towards the small ditch on the edge of the village, wanting to put out the fire on the child's body with water. The child died because of severe burns, and Zhang Yaoyi's clothes were also on fire. He put out the fire on his body and turned around to rush back into the village. A woman was lying at the door of a house. This was Eom Jeong-seop. She was three months pregnant. When the enemy planes came, she was cooking in the house. Hearing the sound of bombs, she hurried to run out, but as soon as she ran out of the door, a bomb fell right on her roof. She was injured in twenty-four places on her body and immediately fainted in a pool of blood. Zhang Yaoyi quickly bandaged Eom Jeong-seop's wounds, picked her up and ran out. Before he had run a few steps, a bomb exploded nearby again. Zhang Yaoyi quickly used his body to shield Eom Jeong-seop, and shrapnel and flying stones injured his back and head..., seven injuries caused him to be somewhat delirious, but he still tried his best to support himself. He crawled forward a few steps and finally fainted too. As soon as the American aerial bandits left, an old Korean woman ran over and saw a Volunteer Army comrade lying on the ground with blood flowing from his head. She quickly took off her white headscarf and wrapped Zhang Yaoyi's head wound. Stretchers arrived, and Zhang Yaoyi was carried away...

    The several people who were rescued by Zhang Yaoyi slowly recovered from their injuries. Six months later, Eom Jeong-seop gave birth to her daughter, Kim Ok-nyeo, who is the little girl we saw. What happened to Zhang Yaoyi? Had he recovered? The people of Wonjik-dong thought of Zhang Yaoyi day and night, restless with these questions. Finally, a pleasant message arrived: Zhang Yaoyi was still alive and had returned home to participate in production after recovering from his injuries. Zhang Yaoyi had joined the agricultural production cooperative in his hometown—Xudun Village, Xinyi County, Jiangsu Province—and was elected as the chairman. To commend his heroic deeds, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army awarded him the honorary titles of First-Class Meritorious Person and Second-Class Model of Loving the People, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded him the high honor of the First-Class National Flag Medal.

    This good news quickly spread throughout Wonjik-dong. How happy people were! To celebrate Zhang Yaoyi's health and to commemorate the unforgettable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, the people of Wonjik-dong busied themselves: the girls happily embroidered their heartfelt words in Chinese and Korean on silk handkerchiefs: "The fighting friendship forged with blood and flesh will last ten thousand years!" The Wonjik-dong Agricultural Production Cooperative (i.e., agricultural production cooperative) busied itself drawing charts of their production achievements and taking photos of their production activities to send to Zhang Yaoyi. Eom Jeong-seop's husband, Kim Seong-ok, the village party secretary of Wonjik-dong, wrote a letter to Zhang Yaoyi, expressing their longing and gratitude: "We are very happy to know that you are still alive and have returned home to participate in production. I am writing this letter to you with pleasure. My wife gave birth to a girl named Kim Ok-nyeo six months after you rescued her... We and all the party members in the village first joined the agricultural production cooperative. To commemorate our friendship, the people who were rescued by you formed the "Zhang Yaoyi Agricultural Production Shock Brigade" named after you...".

    Last July, they received a reply from the agricultural production cooperative where Zhang Yaoyi was. In order to forever commemorate the extraordinary friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, the people of Wonjik-dong named the Wonjik-dong Agricultural Production Cooperative the "Zhang Yaoyi Agricultural Production Cooperative." People cherish this naming very much, this name symbolizing the deep friendship between the two peoples, giving the members a huge boost. People overcame the difficulties brought about by the severe war damage and overfulfilled the production tasks. Last year, the cooperative also expanded from twenty-two households to twenty-eight households. Only two households in the village did not join the cooperative, and they also submitted applications this year. The several women who were rescued not only took the lead in joining the cooperative and formed the "Zhang Yaoyi Agricultural Production Shock Brigade," but also actively worked. Although their injuries have not yet fully healed, Choe Byeong-ban's legs cannot do heavy work; Eom Jeong-seop's left eye is blind, one leg is lame, and there is still shrapnel in one wrist that has not been removed, and she also has to cook and take care of the children at home..., but last year, they worked from dawn to dusk and each worked more than 180 workdays. They were grateful to Zhang Yaoyi, and they used their labor achievements to consolidate the noble friendship formed between the Chinese and Korean people.

    Today, guests from China, from Zhang Yaoyi's motherland, have come specifically to visit them, to visit the members of the Zhang Yaoyi Agricultural Production Cooperative. They feel warm in their hearts, as excited as if they had met long-lost relatives.

    In the house crowded with guests and hosts, Baek Seung-pil, the chairman of the management committee (i.e., chairman) of the Zhang Yaoyi Agricultural Production Cooperative, introduced the situation of the cooperative to the guests and pointed to a framed item hanging on the wall, saying: "This is what all our members decided last year: to write down Zhang Yaoyi's heroic deeds and hang them in the cooperative to educate everyone, to educate our descendants, so that people will remember the unforgettable friendship between our Chinese and Korean peoples. Whenever the members mention Zhang Yaoyi's name, they work even harder. To maintain the honor of this name, we will strive to achieve an income of sixteen kilograms of grain per workday next year."

    Choe Byeong-ban didn't have a chance to interject for a long time. She finally interrupted others, raising her voice and saying: "I have something to say, I am the one who was rescued by Zhang Yaoyi. I am grateful to him. If I have the opportunity in the future, I will definitely go to China to see Comrade Zhang Yaoyi. Today, I swear in front of the representatives of the Chinese delegation: I will participate more actively in production in the future to thank the Chinese people for their assistance...".

    The hosts repeatedly urged the delegation representatives to bring back to China the Korean people's love for the Chinese people. And please tell Comrade Zhang Yaoyi that the Zhang Yaoyi Cooperative in Korea and the cooperative where Zhang Yaoyi is in China are actively preparing for spring plowing and striving for a bumper harvest this year.

    The sun was already setting, and the delegation representatives had to leave, but the guests and hosts still had endless words to say. Eom Jeong-seop and their cooperative separately sent gifts, asking us to pass them on to the cooperative where Zhang Yaoyi is. The people of Wonjik-dong reluctantly surrounded the guests, seeing them off far, far away from the village. Among the crowd, Eom Jeong-seop held her daughter, limping, ignoring the mud in the fields, constantly waving goodbye while still walking forward. Until the car had turned over the mountain and waved again to greet the hosts, the people standing on the avenue were still waving their hands...

    在朝鲜的一个山村里
    本报记者　叶遥
    汽车盘旋在朝鲜的高山峻岭里，人们禁不住惊喜地赞美这里的景色。这时候，在朝鲜度过了几个年头的中国人民志愿军同志们，总是眉飞色舞地说：“这还不是朝鲜最美丽的季节，你们如果是夏天来，满山遍野的金达莱花，开得通红、耀眼，就是最不注意欣赏风景的人，也会被它迷住。”在严寒的冬天里，这种迷人的景色当然还看不到，但是你会看到另一种迷人的花朵——中朝人民用鲜血凝成的友谊之花。
    二月的一天中午，中国人民赴朝慰问团的部分代表到了一个群山环抱的山村江原道平康郡福满里元直洞。这一天，天气格外暖和，积雪融化了，道路泥泞，耕耘过的土地非常松软。这里居住着三十多户人家，战后新盖起来的简朴草房，星散在子弟峰的山脚下。
    元直洞的男男女女、老老少少，站在村边的大道上，欢迎远道来的中国客人。孩子们用中文唱着“东方红”“中国人民志愿军战歌”，打着朝、中两国的国旗欢呼着。站在最前面的三个妇女：严正燮、崔炳半、崔炳月，把鲜花献给慰问团的代表们，双手紧紧握住代表们的手，半天说不出话来。在村子的广场上，元直洞的人们以隆重的集会欢迎中国客人，这三位妇女又并排地站在最前面。三十二岁的严正燮背上背个小孩。小姑娘圆圆的红脸蛋儿，水凌凌的小眼睛，非常逗人喜爱。母亲用双手紧紧地搂着她的后背，含笑地注视着中国客人们的一举一动。四十多岁的崔炳半和崔炳月的眼睛，也一直瞅着客人们。在她们心里激荡着人类最美好的感情——国际主义的感情。
    那是1953年4月17日发生的事情。这一天，元直洞的男人们都下地干活去了，突然，美国空中强盗来到了元直洞的上空，在这里进行轮番轰炸，山村顿时变成了火海。正在山上打柴的中国人民志愿军某部二营通讯员张耀义，看到村里烟火弥漫，便奋不顾身地往村里跑。这时候在山坡上、村子里，弹片和炸起的石头四处飞舞，一股股的气浪卷着浓烟烈火燃烧着村庄。张耀义一心抢救朝鲜人民，什么也顾不得了。他首先冲进一所被炸塌的正在着火的房子里，抢救出被压在房柱子下面，已经昏迷过去的崔炳月。接着，他又冲进烈火里去，这时候，福满里的劳动党书记长康锡柱也随着冲了进去，和张耀义共同抢救出两个妇女：其中一个就是崔炳半。康锡柱在抢救中负了伤，张耀义给康锡柱包扎好伤口，又从火堆里抢出了一个七、八岁的孩子，就往村边的小河沟里跑，想用水扑灭孩子身上的火，孩子因为烧伤太重死去了，张耀义的衣服也烧着了，他扑灭了自己身上的火，又转身冲进村子里去。一间房子的门口躺着一个妇女，这就是严正燮。她怀孕已三个月了，敌人的飞机来时，她正在房子里做饭，听到炸弹声，她忙往外跑，刚跑出门，一颗炸弹正落在她的房顶上，她身上被炸了二十四处伤，当即昏倒在血泊里。张耀义迅速给严正燮包扎了伤口，把她抱起就往外跑，没有跑出几步，炸弹又在附近爆炸了，张耀义忙用自己的身体掩护着严正燮，弹片和飞石伤了他的背部、头部……，七处伤花使他有些神志不清了，但他还竭力支撑着自己，他用力往前爬了几步，终于也昏迷过去了。美国空中强盗刚走，一位朝鲜老大娘跑过来，看到地上躺着一位头部正在流血的志愿军同志，她急忙解下自己的白头巾，给张耀义包住头上的伤口。救护担架来了，张耀义被抬走了……。
    被张耀义抢救出来的几个人，伤慢慢好了。六个月后，严正燮生下了她的女儿金玉女，这就是我们看到的那位小姑娘。张耀义到底怎样了？他的身体复原了没有？元直洞的人们日夜想念着张耀义，为这些疑问坐卧不安。终于一个愉快的消息传来：张耀义还活着，伤好后回家生产了。张耀义在他的家乡——江苏省新沂县许墩村参加了农业生产合作社并被选为社长。为了表彰他的英雄功绩，中国人民志愿军授给他一等功臣、二级爱民模范的光荣称号，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国授给他一级国旗勋章的崇高荣誉。
    这个喜讯很快传遍了元直洞。人们多么喜欢啊！为了庆贺张耀义的健康，为了纪念中朝人民难忘的友谊，元直洞的人们忙碌起来了：姑娘们以愉快的心情，在丝绢手帕上用中、朝两国文字绣上心里的话：“以血肉凝成的战斗友谊永恒万年！”元直洞农业生产协同组合（即农业生产合作社）忙着把他们的生产成绩画成图表、把他们的生产活动拍成照片，寄给张耀义。严正燮的丈夫金成玉是元直洞村支部书记，给张耀义写了一封信，倾吐他们的怀念和感激：“知道你还活着并且已经回家生产了，我们很高兴。我现在以愉快的心情写这封信给你。我的妻子被你抢救出险后六个月，生了一个女孩名叫金玉女……我们和全村的党员首先参加了农业生产协同组合。为了纪念我们的友谊，被你救出的几个人组成了以你的名字命名的“张耀义农业生产突击班”……”。
    去年七月，他们收到了张耀义所在的农业生产合作社的回信。元直洞的人们为了永远纪念中、朝人民不同寻常的友谊，把元直洞农业生产协同组合，命名为“张耀义农业生产协同组合”。人们十分珍贵这个命名，这个象征着两国人民深厚友谊的名字，给社员们以巨大的鼓舞力量。人们战胜了严重的战争破坏带来的困难，超额完成了生产任务。去年这个社也由二十二户扩大为二十八户，全村只有两户没有入社，今年也递了入社申请书。被救的几个妇女，不但首先带头参加了社，组成了“张耀义农业生产突击班”，而且积极劳动。虽然她们的伤都还没有全好，崔炳半的腿还不能做重活；严正燮的左眼失明了，一只腿瘸着，一只手腕内还有弹片没有取出，而且还得在家烧饭、照顾孩子……，但去年一年，她们起早贪黑，每人都做了180个以上的劳动日。她们感激张耀义，用劳动成绩来巩固中朝人民结成的崇高友谊。
    今天，从中国、从张耀义的祖国来的客人们，专诚来看望她们，来看望张耀义农业生产协同组合的社员们，她们心里热呼呼的，像见了久别重逢的亲人一样兴奋，激动。
    在挤满了客人们和主人们的房子里，张耀义农业生产协同组合管理委员长（即社长）白承毕，给客人们介绍了社里的情况后，指着挂在墙上用框子装的一张东西说：“这是去年我们全体社员决定的：把张耀义的英雄事迹写出来，悬挂在社里，教育大家，教育我们的后代，让人们记着我们中、朝两国人民永世难忘的友谊。社员们一提起张耀义的名字，干的劲头就更足了。为了保持这名字的荣誉，我们明年争取每个劳动日达到十六斤粮食的收入。”
    崔炳半好半天没有机会插上嘴。她终于打断了别人的话头，提高嗓音说：“我有句话要讲，我是被张耀义救出来的人。我感激他。将来有机会，我一定到中国去看张耀义同志。今天，我在中国慰问团代表们的面前宣誓：今后我要更积极地参加生产，来答谢中国人民给我们的援助……。”
    主人们再三叮嘱慰问团的代表们，一定要把朝鲜人民对中国人民的热爱带回中国去。并请转告张耀义同志，朝鲜的张耀义社和中国的张耀义所在的社一样，正在积极准备春耕，争取今年丰收。
    太阳已经偏西了，慰问团的代表们还要赶路，但客人们和主人们还是千言万语说不尽。严正燮和他们社里分别送了礼物，要我们转给张耀义所在的社。元直洞的人们恋恋不舍地簇拥着客人们，送出村子很远很远。在人群中，严正燮抱着她的女儿，颠跛着腿，不顾田里的泥泞，一面不断挥手告别，一面仍然向前走着。直到汽车已经转过山头，再次挥手向主人致意的时候，伫立在大道上的人们还挥着双手……。
