Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 23rd. At a meeting held today by the Hangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate of Zhejiang Province to handle the surrender of counter-revolutionary elements, lenient treatment was given to Zhang Yi, a special agent who infiltrated Zhejiang and held the titles of "Special Commissioner of the Shanghai District" of the "Second Group of the Kuomintang Central Committee." More than 700 people attended today's meeting, including staff members from various agencies in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City, representatives from various democratic parties, and members of religious circles.

At the meeting, Luo Yongfa, Deputy Procurator-General of the Hangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate, announced that, based on the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, atonement for crimes through meritorious service, and rewards for great meritorious service," Zhang Yi, who surrendered himself and had shown meritorious service, would not be prosecuted. He also agreed with the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's suggestion to give Zhang Yi a material reward. Subsequently, Zhang Shixiang, Director of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, presented the bonus to Zhang Yi at the meeting. Zhang Yi also excitedly stated at the meeting that he would start anew under the government's lenient treatment and contribute to the construction of a socialist motherland.

Gu Chunlin, Deputy Mayor of Hangzhou, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Hangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate's handling of the special agent Zhang Yi, who surrendered himself and had shown meritorious service, once again embodied the government's policy of combining suppression and leniency towards counter-revolutionary elements. The path taken by Zhang Yi is the bright road that all counter-revolutionary elements should choose.

Zhang Yi is a native of Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province, and is 36 years old this year. He joined the Kuomintang's special agent organization in 1937, then joined the "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (BIS)," and received special agent training at the "Qingpu Training Class." Afterwards, he engaged in special agent activities in the Shanghai area. In the early days of liberation, Zhang Yi fled to Taiwan. In 1950, he was dispatched by the "Second Department of the Air Force Headquarters" of the Kuomintang to infiltrate Shanghai to develop a special agent organization, collect intelligence on the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, and plan to establish a secret radio station. Subsequently, Zhang Yi returned to Taiwan and successively accepted assignments from the "Mainland Work Office of the Ministry of National Defense," the "Data Group of the Presidential Office" of Chiang Kai-shek's special agent agency, and the American imperialist espionage agency "Western Enterprises Corporation." In December 1953, Zhang Yi joined the special agent organization of the "Second Group of the Kuomintang Central Committee." In March 1954, he was dispatched to Dachen Island, attempting to infiltrate the mainland but failed. In the winter of 1955, he was appointed by the "Second Group of the Kuomintang Central Committee" as the "Special Commissioner of the Shanghai District," and after receiving special agent activity funds and a radio station, he went to Hong Kong. On February 8th of this year, he infiltrated the mainland again under the guise of returning home for the Spring Festival. After Zhang Yi infiltrated the mainland, he was unable to carry out special agent activities due to the strict precautions taken by the people with revolutionary vigilance. At the same time, inspired by the lenient policy of the People's Government and seeing the achievements and bright prospects of socialist construction in the motherland, he finally surrendered himself to the People's Government on February 16th of this year and exposed many counter-revolutionary elements. The exposed counter-revolutionary elements have all been verified by the public security organs.

    杭州宽大处理一名重要的特务分子
    新华社杭州23日电  浙江省杭州市人民检察院在今天举行的处理自首投案反革命分子大会上，对潜入浙江的特务分子“国民党中央委员会第二组”“上海区特派员”张毅，作了宽大处理。参加今天大会的有浙江省和杭州市各机关工作人员、各民主党派和宗教界等共七百多人。
    会上，杭州市人民检察院副检察长罗永法根据“坦白从宽、抗拒从严，立功折罪，立大功受奖”的政策，宣布对自首投案并有立功表现的张毅不予起诉，并同意杭州市公安局给予张毅物质奖励的意见。接着，杭州市公安局局长张世祥在会上把奖金发给了张毅。张毅也激动地在会上表示：要在政府宽大处理下重新作人，并为建设社会主义的祖国而出力。
    在大会上讲话的还有杭州市副市长顾春林。他说，杭州市人民检察院对自首投案并有立功表现的特务分子张毅的处理，再一次体现了政府对待反革命分子的镇压与宽大相结合的政策。张毅所走的道路，是一切反革命分子应该选择的光明大道。
    张毅是浙江省镇海县人，今年三十六岁。他在1937年就参加了国民党的特务组织，接着又参加了“中统局”，并在“青浦训练班”受过特务训练，以后即在上海一带进行特务活动。解放初期，张毅逃往台湾。1950年他由国民党“空军总部第二署”派遣，潜入上海发展特务组织，收集中国人民解放军空军情报，并筹划建立秘密电台。随后，张毅又潜返台湾，先后接受过蒋介石特务机关“国防部大陆工作处”、“总统府资料组”和美帝国主义间谍机关“西方企业公司”的派遣。1953年12月，张毅又参加了“国民党中央委员会第二组”的特务组织，并在1954年3月间被派遣到大陈岛企图潜入大陆未成。1955年冬，他又被“国民党中央委员会第二组”委任为“上海区特派员”，领取特务活动经费和电台后到香港，在今年二月八日以春节返乡探亲为名再度潜入大陆。张毅潜入大陆后由于到处受到具有革命警惕性的人民群众的严密防范，无法进行特务活动，同时由于人民政府宽大政策的感召和看到祖国社会主义建设的成就和美好远景，终于在今年二月十六日向人民政府投案自首，并且检举了反革命分子多名。被检举的反革命分子都经公安机关查证属实。
