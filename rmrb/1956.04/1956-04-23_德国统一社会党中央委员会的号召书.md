Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 21st: Today is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. "Neues Deutschland" published a full-page appeal from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany commemorating the tenth anniversary of the party's founding on its front page.

The appeal stated that ten years ago today, the Communists and Social Democrats in eastern Germany formed a great fraternal alliance.

Ten years later, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany stands before the German working class and all German working people, and presents them with a work report.

We have realized the dream of an entire generation. Now we are building a socialist society in the land where Marx and Engels were born.

Comrades! Workers! Working peasants! Intellectuals!

You have created a new and great cause in the German Democratic Republic, sacrificing everything and working hard. You have shown the people of the world that industrious Germany has embarked on the road of peace and socialist construction. With us is the vast and powerful Soviet Union. With us is the populous China. With us are the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia. With us is the working class of France and Italy.

With the start of the Second Five-Year Plan, we will master modern technology in industry and agriculture. The pride felt in past achievements will encourage us to complete the tasks put forward by the Third Party Congress with a great sense of responsibility in all areas of social life.

German workers, when the Socialist Unity Party of Germany victoriously carried out the struggle against fascism and militarism, it was not only for the benefit of the people of the German Democratic Republic, but also for the benefit of all working people in Germany. Today, when our party stands at the forefront of socialist construction, it also represents the interests of our working-class brothers in West Germany.

The appeal concluded by saying that for the common goals that the German workers' movement has fought for for a hundred years, we extend our hand to all Social Democrats, trade union members, and all working people in West Germany, so that we can form a great fraternal alliance. The working people of the East and West joining hands is the guarantee of forcing the capitalist reactionaries to step down and guiding the cause of the working people to victory.

    德国统一社会党中央委员会的号召书
    据新华社柏林21日电  今天是德国统一社会党成立十周年纪念日。“新德意志报”以首页整版地位刊载德国统一社会党中央委员会纪念党成立十周年的号召书。
    号召书说，在十年前的今天，德国东部的共产党人和社会民主党人结成了伟大的兄弟联盟。
    在十年后的今天，德国统一社会党站在德国工人阶级和德国全体劳动人民面前，并且向他们提出了工作报告。
    我们实现了整个一代的梦想。现在正在马克思、恩格斯诞生的国土上建设着社会主义社会。
    同志们！工人们！劳动农民们！知识分子们！
    你们不惜一切牺牲和辛苦，在德意志民主共和国创造了新的伟大的事业，你们向世界人民表示了勤劳的德国已经走上了和平和社会主义建设的道路。和我们在一起的有幅员辽阔而强大的苏联。和我们在一起的有世界上人口众多的中国。和我们在一起的有欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家。和我们在一起的有法国和意大利的工人阶级。
    随着第二个五年计划的开始，我们要在工农业中掌握现代化的技术。对于过去成就所感到的自豪将是对我们的鼓舞，使我们在社会生活的各个领域中以巨大的责任感来完成第三次党代表会议所提出的任务。
    德国的工人们，当德国统一社会党胜利地进行了反法西斯主义和军国主义斗争的时候，它不仅是为了德意志民主共和国人民的利益，而且也是为了整个德国劳动人民的利益。今天当我们的党站在社会主义建设的前列的时候，它也同样是代表着西德工人弟兄的利益的。
    号召书最后说，为了德国工人运动一百年以来所争取的共同目标，我们向所有社会民主党人、工会会员和西德的所有劳动人民伸出我们的手，以便使我们结成伟大的兄弟联盟。东部和西部劳动人民握起手来，就是迫使资本主义反动派下台和引导劳动人民的事业走向胜利的保证。
