Developing Water Resources in the Chaohu Area

    The overall basin planning for the vast area centered on Chaohu Lake in Anhui Province is underway. Hydrological technicians are sorting out meteorological data. A surveying team of over 800 people has begun intensive work, traversing mountains and rivers. Five surveying teams dispatched by the Huai River Harnessing Committee to this area will complete the survey of 6,800 square kilometers this year.

    The Chaohu area, including the Wan River and Chu River basins, covers an area of 35,000 square kilometers, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the area of Anhui Province, and possesses great economic potential. The basin planning work will be conducive to the comprehensive development of water resources in this area. This planning work is commissioned by the Anhui Provincial Water Conservancy Department to the Huai River Harnessing Committee Survey and Design Institute and is expected to be completed in the first half of next year.

    开发巢湖地区水利资源
    安徽省以巢湖为中心的广大地区的流域总规划工作正在开始。水文技术人员们，正整理气象资料。由八百多人组成的测量队，跋山涉水开始了紧张的工作。由治淮委员会派在这个地区的五个测量队，今年要完成六千八百平方公里的测量任务。
    巢湖地区包括皖河、滁河流域在内面积达三万五千平方公里，占安徽省面积的四分之一左右，是经济潜力很大的地区。流域规划工作，将有利于这个地区水利资源的全面开发。这个规划工作是安徽省水利厅委托治淮委员会勘测设计院进行的，预计明年上半年可以完成。
