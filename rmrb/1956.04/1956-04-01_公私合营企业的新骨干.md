    New Backbone of Joint State-Private Enterprises
    More than 2,400 cadres from worker and shop assistant backgrounds have become the backbone of leadership in Beijing's joint state-private enterprises. These worker cadres were promoted during the process of implementing the conversion of all private enterprises into joint state-private enterprises in the first quarter of this year. Wang Dacun, who had been an accountant at the private Xi Henian Tang Chinese medicine store for thirteen years, became the deputy manager of the Qianmen branch of the Beijing Chinese Medicine Professional Company. Seeing that another deputy manager (a private sector employee) in the branch was unwilling to take responsibility, he proactively discussed work with him and proposed a division of labor system. With Wang Dacun's encouragement and help, this deputy manager is now able to handle affairs within the scope of his division of labor responsibly. Li Lingzhou, a worker at the former private Yuhua Knitting Factory, became the Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch of the joint state-private Qianmen District Knitting Factory. He not only helps the state representatives correctly implement the production reorganization policy but also promptly puts forward suggestions for improving product quality after the reorganization and merger of factories. He also mobilized the workers to learn from the experience of producing defect-free products, reducing the factory's defect rate by two-thirds. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    公私合营企业的新骨干
    二千四百多个工人、店员出身的干部，已经成为北京市公私合营企业领导工作的骨干力量。这些工人干部是在今年第一季度私营企业实行全行业公私合营过程中被提拔的。原来在私营西鹤年堂国药店当了十三年会计的王达僔，担任北京市国药专业公司前门区分店的副经理以后，看到分店里另一副经理（私方从业人员）办事不肯负责，就主动地和他研究工作，并且提出分工制度。在王达僔鼓励帮助下，这一副经理现在已能负责处理分工范围内的事务。原私营裕华针织厂工人李凌洲担任了公私合营前门区针织厂中共党支部书记，他不仅能帮助公股代表正确执行生产改组的方针，并且在改组并厂以后，及时提出改进产品质量的建议，发动工人学习不出次品的经验，使全厂次品率降低三分之二。　（据新华社讯）
