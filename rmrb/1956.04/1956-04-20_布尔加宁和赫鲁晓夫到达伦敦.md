Xinhua News Agency, London, April 19th: According to TASS, Bulganin, Khrushchev, and their entourage arrived at Victoria Station in London by special train on April 18th. Thousands of Britons gathered in the square in front of the station to welcome the Soviet leaders.

British Prime Minister Eden, Foreign Secretary Lloyd, and the doyen of the diplomatic corps in London, Norwegian Ambassador Prebensen, were among those who welcomed the Soviet leaders at the station platform.

Bulganin and Eden delivered speeches in front of the loudspeakers. Eden expressed his pleasure in welcoming Bulganin and Khrushchev to visit Britain. He said: "Their visit is the result of the invitation I extended to our guests during the Geneva summit. Since then, many events have occurred on the international stage, but, as I believe, our guests and I agree that, due to their visit, we can discuss with Bulganin and Khrushchev many issues involving Anglo-Soviet relations, as well as world peace and prosperity." Eden stated: "We hope to improve relations between our two countries and our peoples through our activities and decisions."

Bulganin delivered a reply, first extending warm greetings to the British government and the British people. Bulganin said, "The Soviet people highly respect the British people and greatly appreciate British culture and their outstanding achievements in science and technology. The Soviet people also clearly remember our combat friendship, remembering the difficult years of fighting against a common enemy in the last war."

Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet government strives to establish friendly relations with Britain, and is also committed to establishing friendly relations with the United States, France, and other countries. He said that some work has been done in this regard in recent years, but in the future, a long and possibly arduous road will have to be taken. The differences in the social and political systems of our countries should not prevent us from living in harmony, nor should they prevent us from actively cooperating and improving our relations.

Bulganin said, "For the benefit of both countries, it is necessary to restore extensive mutual economic ties, expand our trade relations, exchange experience in technology, science, and culture, and exchange information on achievements in these sectors. We believe that all this is the practical implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between countries."

Bulganin continued, saying that the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace is the foundation of Soviet foreign policy. The British people undoubtedly also long for peace and security. The Soviet and British peoples' desire for peace, and their vested interests in stopping war and halting the arms race, can become a solid foundation for strengthening and developing friendship and cooperation between our two countries.

Bulganin hoped that this visit, as well as direct contact with British government officials, would help ease international tensions, build further mutual understanding, and further improve relations between Britain and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet guests were welcomed by hundreds of thousands of residents of the British capital on their way from the station to the "Claridge's" hotel, where they would be staying during their visit.

On the afternoon of the 18th, Bulganin and Khrushchev, accompanied by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hayter, toured London by car.

In the evening, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd held a banquet at the "Claridge's" hotel to entertain Bulganin and Khrushchev. Those attending the banquet included British Prime Minister Eden, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Reading, and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Hayter. On the Soviet side, in addition to Bulganin and Khrushchev, there were Mikhailov, Gromyko, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, London, April 19th: On the morning of April 19th, Bulganin and Khrushchev, on behalf of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, laid a wreath at the monument to the fallen soldiers of the First and Second World Wars.

Subsequently, Bulganin and Khrushchev, accompanied by British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir William Hayter, went to Buckingham Palace, the palace of Queen Elizabeth II.

After visiting Buckingham Palace, Bulganin and Khrushchev went to 10 Downing Street, the official residence of Prime Minister Eden, to pay a courtesy visit to Eden. Eden received them. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd was also present at the meeting.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫到达伦敦
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：四月十八日，布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和他们的随行人员乘专车抵达伦敦维多利亚车站。几千名英国人集合在车站前的广场上欢迎苏联领导人。
    在车站站台上欢迎苏联领导人的有英国首相艾登，外交大臣劳埃德，驻伦敦外交使团团长、挪威大使普雷本逊等。
    布尔加宁和艾登在扩音机前发表了演说。艾登表示愉快地欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国。他说：“他们的访问是我在日内瓦政府首脑会议期间对我们客人提出邀请的结果。自那时以后，在国际舞台上已经发生了许多事件，但是，正如我相信的那样，我们的客人和我一致地认为，由于他们的访问，我们可以同布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在许多涉及英苏关系、以及世界和平和繁荣的问题上进行会谈。”艾登表示：“希望我们以自己的活动及决定来改善我们两国及我们人民之间的关系。”
    布尔加宁致答词，他首先向英国政府和英国人民致热情的问候。布尔加宁说，“苏联人民非常尊敬英国人民，对英国人民的文化和他们在科学和技术方面的卓越成就估计很高。苏联人还清楚地记得我们的战斗友谊，记得在上次战争中反对共同敌人的艰苦年月。”
    布尔加宁指出，苏联政府努力谋求同英国建立友好关系，同样也致力于同美国、法国和其他国家建立友好关系。他说，近年在这方面进行了某些工作，但是在今后，还得要走一段漫长的、可能是艰巨的路程。我们这几国社会和政治制度的不同不应当妨碍我们睦邻相处，不应当妨碍我们积极合作和改进我们的关系。
    布尔加宁说，“为了两国的利益，必须恢复广泛的互相经济联系，扩大我们的贸易关系，互相交流技术、科学和文化各部门的经验以及交换关于这些部门的成就的情报。我们认为，这一切就是各国和平共处和合作的原则的实际执行。”
    布尔加宁接着说，为维护和巩固和平而斗争是苏联对外政策的基础。英国人民无疑也渴望和平和安全。苏联人民和英国人民对和平的热望，他们在制止战争和停止扩张军备上的利害关系，可以成为加强和发展我们两国之间的友谊和合作的巩固基础。
    布尔加宁希望这次访问以及同英国政府人员的直接接触，将有助于缓和国际紧张局势，建立更进一步的相互了解，以及进一步改善英国同苏联的关系。
    苏联客人们在从车站到他们访问期间居住的“克莱里吉”饭店途中，受到英国首都成千上万居民的欢迎。
    十八日下午，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在英国驻苏联大使海特尔的陪同下，乘汽车游览伦敦。
    晚上，英国外交大臣劳埃德在“克莱里吉”饭店举行宴会，招待布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。出席宴会的有英国首相艾登、外交副大臣里丁，英国驻苏联大使海特尔。苏联方面出席宴会的除布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫外，还有米哈伊洛夫、葛罗米柯等人。
    新华社据塔斯社伦敦19日讯　四月十九日上午，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫代表苏联政府和苏联人民向第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战阵亡将士纪念碑献花圈。
    随后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在英国驻苏联大使威廉·海特尔爵士陪同下前往女王伊丽莎白二世的王宫——白金汉宫。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在访问白金汉宫之后前往唐宁街十号艾登首相的官邸对艾登作礼节上的访问。艾登接见了他们。接见时在座的还有英国外交大臣劳埃德。
