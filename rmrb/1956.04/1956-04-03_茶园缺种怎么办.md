    What to Do About Missing Seedlings in Tea Gardens
    Yu Tingzi
    In order to complete the tea production tasks in the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, all tea-producing areas in the country must open up new tea gardens and replant missing seedlings in old tea gardens this year.
    The biggest difficulty at present is the shortage of tea seeds. Last spring, tea trees suffered from frost damage, resulting in a poor tea seed harvest. In addition, there was a lack of experience in saving tea seeds in the past and a lack of planning, which further increased the difficulty of the tea seed shortage. Many tea-producing provinces have requested the transfer of tea seeds from other provinces. However, where can so many tea seeds be supplied all at once? Therefore, the most reliable method is for tea-producing areas to find ways to overcome this difficulty themselves.
    In order to overcome the difficulty of tea seed shortage, Zhejiang Province has fully mobilized agricultural production cooperatives in tea areas to formulate tea seed retention plans. This year, in addition to widespread seed retention, the province has also specially set up 100,000 mu of seed collection tea gardens, planning to produce 100,000 dan of tea seeds. The conditions for dedicated seed collection tea gardens are: early budding, large leaves, high fruit setting rate, and the ability to collect more than 80 jin of qualified tea seeds each time.
    Digging and transplanting wild tea seedlings is also a way to solve the tea seed problem. There are many wild tea seedlings in various tea-producing areas, which should be fully utilized. For example, Fuyang County in Zhejiang Province originally planned to open up 3,500 mu of new tea gardens this year, but in fact, it has opened up 5,000 mu by using wild tea seedlings alone. Digging and transplanting wild tea seedlings can not only solve the problem of lack of seedlings and seeds, but also allow tea trees to be harvested one or two years earlier than general direct seeding, while saving the cost of cultivating tea seedlings.
    The use of asexual reproduction methods can also partially overcome the difficulty of tea seed shortage. Asexual reproduction methods mainly include layering and cutting. The advantages of this method are that it is simple, has a high survival rate, saves costs, and allows for early tea harvesting. It can be used for replanting old tea gardens and opening up new tea gardens. Sheng County in Zhejiang Province plans to use this method to open up 56,000 mu of new tea gardens. Fujian Province plans to use cutting methods to propagate 120 million excellent varieties of "Dabai Tea" and "Maoyong," which can open up 100,000 mu of new tea gardens.
    The broad masses in tea areas have many experiences in solving the tea seed problem. Leading organs and professionals in tea-producing areas should go deep into the masses, earnestly summarize the experiences of the masses, and vigorously promote them. This is of great significance for completing the task of opening up new tea gardens and replanting missing seedlings in old tea gardens.

    茶园缺种怎么办
    于汀子
    为了提前完成五年计划中的茶叶生产任务，今年全国各产茶地区要大量开辟新茶园和补植旧茶园的缺株。
    目前最大的困难是茶籽不足。去年春季茶树遭受冻害，茶籽歉收，再加过去对蓄留茶籽缺乏经验，也缺乏计划，这就更增加了茶籽缺乏的困难。许多产茶省都要求从外省调剂茶籽。可是，一下子从哪里供应这么多的茶籽呢？因此，最可靠的办法，是各产茶地区自己设法克服这个困难。
    浙江省为了克服茶籽不足的困难，全面发动茶区农业生产合作社订出茶籽留种计划。全省今年除普遍留种外，并且专门设置采种茶园十万亩，计划生产茶籽十万担。专用采种茶园的条件是：萌芽早，叶张大，结实率高，每次可采合格茶种在八十斤以上。
    挖掘和移栽野生茶苗，也是解决茶籽问题的一个办法。各产茶地区野生茶苗很多，应该充分利用。如浙江富阳县今年原计划新辟茶园三千五百亩，实际上单是利用野生茶苗，就新辟了五千亩。挖掘和移植野生茶苗，不仅可以解决缺少苗木种子的问题，而且可以比一般直播的茶树提早一、二年采茶，同时节省了培育茶苗的工本。
    采用无性繁殖方法，也可以局部克服茶籽不足的困难。无性繁殖方法主要是压条和扦插。这种办法的好处是方法简便、成活率高、节省费用、提早采茶；补植旧茶园和开辟新茶园都可采用。浙江嵊县计划采用这个办法，新辟茶园五万六千亩；福建省计划采用扦插办法繁育优良品种“大白茶”和“毛蛹”一亿二千万株，可以新辟茶园十万亩。
    在茶区的广大群众中有许多解决茶籽问题的经验，产茶区的领导机关和专业人员应当深入群众，认真地总结群众的经验，大力加以推广。这对于完成开辟新茶园和补植旧茶园缺株的任务，具有重要意义。
