Criticize Conservative Thinking, Support Workers' Creative Enthusiasm

    Why the Liaoning Farm Tool Factory Cannot Fulfill its Production Quota

    Editor:
    The Liaoning Farm Tool Factory's production task for the first quarter of this year was poorly completed. In January and February, the planned value of goods produced did not even reach 50%. The reason for this situation is mainly that the factory leaders did not pay attention to the labor enthusiasm of the workers, and thus failed to make this enthusiasm a driving force for production.
    At the end of January this year, when all the factory's employees discussed the national plan, they expressed their confidence that this year's production task could be overfulfilled. They criticized the leadership's idea of not relying on the masses and the chaotic phenomena in production management, and put forward 303 rationalization proposals (as of March 15th). However, so far, only 58 of these proposals have been implemented, and most of them were solved by the workers themselves. Many key or technically complex suggestions have been delayed for a long time. For example, Comrade Zhang Haichun of the foundry workshop proposed an advanced "multiple parts per mold" operation method at the end of January, which could increase production efficiency by 60%; however, the factory's technical team took more than a month to draw a very simple sketch and hand it over to the tool workshop for trial production. The result did not meet the requirements of the original proposal, and it was returned. Finally, the trial production was successful recently, but it cannot be mass-produced yet. Some suggestions were originally easy to solve, but they have not been solved for a long time. For example, the planing machine workers in the tool workshop requested in early February that the administration change the electric switch farther from the lathe to an automatic magnetic switch and install it on the planing machine to reduce the time for the lathe workers to walk back and forth, but this problem has not been solved until now.
    The factory does not pay enough attention to the work of promoting advanced experience. According to the workers' reflections, it is "more talk than action." For example, Comrade Zhao Lianguo, a worker in this factory, experimented with using "hard molds" to cast parts in 1951. Later, farm tool factories in Jiamusi, Qiqihar and other places sent people to learn this experience. The use effect was very good, and the scrap rate was reduced as a result; however, this experience has never been adopted in this factory. It was not until the National Farm Tool Conference last year that the factory leaders discovered that there was such a thing, so they decided to use "hard mold" castings. Because some technical problems could not be solved for a while, this advanced experience has not been fully utilized until now. For example, after the National Farm Tool Conference, the factory director proposed to learn from the standard plan of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory and organize specialized assembly line workshops, but three months have passed, and the factory's production order is still very chaotic. Not only has the standard plan not been issued, but the production operation plan for March was not decided until the middle of the month, which could not play a guiding role in production at all.
    The factory leaders always believe that to complete the task, it is necessary to add equipment and increase manpower. Of course, it is necessary to appropriately add equipment and manpower. However, the factory's more important problem at present is to fully utilize the existing manpower and equipment. In January and February this year, the factory wasted more than 20,000 work hours due to unreasonable labor organization and a lack of production planning, which is equivalent to the work hours required to produce more than 250 animal-drawn ten-row seeders. In July 1955, this factory transferred in a 160-ton crankshaft press, which is said to be able to produce 2,000 to 3,000 harrow discs every day, and at the same time can reduce two processes, so it is possible to free up four small machine tools to produce other parts. However, this press has been idle until now.
    The backward production situation of the Liaoning Farm Tool Factory is inconsistent with the requirements of the country. It is recommended that the Third Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry urge and assist the factory leaders to work hard to improve their work, actively find ways to rectify production order and promote the labor enthusiasm of workers, so as to ensure that the national plan can be completed on time.

### 辽宁农具厂为什么完不成生产任务

    批判保守思想，支持工人的创造热情
    辽宁农具厂为什么完不成生产任务编辑同志：
    辽宁农具厂今年第一季度的生产任务完成得很差，一、二月份商品产值计划连50％都没有完成。造成这种情况的原因，主要是这个厂的领导人没有重视职工群众的劳动积极性，使这种积极性成为推动生产的力量。
    今年一月底，全厂职工在讨论国家计划的时候，满怀信心提出今年的生产任务是可以超额完成的。他们批评了领导方面不依靠群众的思想和生产管理中的混乱现象，并且提出了303件合理化建议（到三月十五日止）。但是到目前为止，这些建议实现的只有五十八件，而且大部分还是工人自己动手解决的。不少带有关键性或技术比较复杂的建议却长期拖延不能解决。例如铸工车间张海春同志在一月底提出的“一箱多活”的先进操作方法，可以使生产效率提高60％；但是工厂的技术组拖了一个多月才绘出一张很简单的草图交工具车间试制，结果不符合原建议的要求，又被退回来，到最近总算试制成功了，可是还不能大量生产。有些建议本来是很容易解决的，但是也长期解决不了。像工具车间的刨床工人在二月上旬就要求行政上把距离车床较远的电门改成自动磁器开关，装在刨床上，以减少车工来回走动的时间，但这个问题一直到现在也没有解决。
    厂里对推广先进经验的工作重视得很不够，照工人的反映是“喊得多，做得少”。例如，这个厂的工人赵连国同志在1951年就试验了使用“硬模”铸造部件的做法，后来佳木斯、齐齐哈尔等地农具厂曾派人来学习这项经验，使用效果很好，废品率也因此减少；但是，这项经验在本厂就始终没有采用。直到去年开全国农具会议的时候，厂里的负责人才发现有这样一件事情，于是决定使用“硬模”铸件，由于还有一些技术问题一时解决不了，这项先进经验到现在还没有充分地运用。又如全国农具会议后，厂长就提出要学习北京农业机械厂的标准计划和组织专业流水车间，但至今三个月了，全厂的生产秩序仍然十分混乱，不但标准计划没有下达，而且三月份的生产作业计划到月中才决定，根本不能够起到指导生产的作用。
    这个厂的领导人总是认为要完成任务就得添设备，加人力。当然，适当地增添设备和人力是需要的。但是，目前厂里更主要的问题是把现有的人力和设备充分利用起来。今年一、二月份，这个厂由于劳动组织不合理，生产计划性不强等原因而浪费的工时达两万多个，等于生产二百五十多台畜力十行播种机所需要的工时。这个厂在1955年七月调进一台一百六十吨曲轴压力机，据说每天可以生产二千至三千片耙片，同时能够减少两道工序，这样就有可能腾出四台小机床生产其他的部件，但是，这架压力机到现在还被闲置着。
    辽宁农具厂这种生产落后的情况是同国家的要求不相称的。建议第三机械工业部和辽宁省工业厅督促并协助这个厂的领导方面努力改进工作，积极设法整顿生产秩序和发扬工人的劳动积极性，以便保证国家计划能够按时完成。
