    A Batch of Han Chinese Middle and Primary School Graduates from Hainan
    Go to Work as Accountants in Agricultural Cooperatives Run by the Li and Miao Ethnic Groups
    973 Han Chinese middle and primary school graduates from Hainan Island set off on the 15th to work as accountants in agricultural production cooperatives in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. They volunteered in response to the call of the Hainan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and prior to their departure, they studied ethnic policies, collectivization policies, and financial accounting skills.

    The minority ethnic groups in five counties of the mountainous Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have established 146 agricultural production cooperatives. There is now a need for a considerable number of accounting personnel to strengthen the management of financial work.
