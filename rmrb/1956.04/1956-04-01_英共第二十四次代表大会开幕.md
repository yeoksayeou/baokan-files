Xinhua News Agency, London, March 31st: According to TASS, the 24th National Congress of the British Communist Party opened on the 30th in the Battersea district of London. Approximately seven hundred delegates with voting rights and speaking rights are attending the congress.

    The congress began with a brief opening speech by Gallacher, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party.

    The congress then approved the summary report of the Executive Committee on the party's activities in the past two years.

    The General Secretary of the Communist Party, Pollitt, delivered the political report of the Party's Executive Committee.

    Pollitt advocated that British foreign policy should adopt the following approach: reach an agreement on an all-encompassing European security system and an agreement on the German question that can prevent the revival of German militarism, ban nuclear weapons, prohibit future testing of such weapons, and adopt a mutually agreed disarmament plan, significantly reduce military spending, cease all colonial wars, grant independence to the people of colonial countries, restore the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations, and remove political restrictions on trade with socialist countries.

    When discussing the British economic situation, Pollitt said that excessive military spending has distorted the development of the British economy. At the same time, Britain is facing increasingly fierce competition in foreign markets.

    Pollitt put forward the party's program of struggle, including striving to increase workers' wages, opposing production cuts and unemployment, striving to develop trade between East and West, striving to reduce military spending, increasing taxes on the wealthy, and expanding social services.

    Pollitt said that only a united workers' movement can achieve this program. He put forward the demand for united action to the Labour Party.

    The congress then discussed Pollitt's report. Many speakers emphasized the need to strengthen the unity of the workers' movement and cited many examples of united action by Labour Party members and Communist Party members in the struggle to meet the economic demands of the working people.

    英共第二十四次代表大会开幕
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社伦敦31日讯：英国共产党第二十四次代表大会三十日在伦敦的白特西区开幕。出席代表大会的约有七百名有表决权和发言权的代表。
    代表大会开始，由英国共产党执行委员会主席加拉赫致简短的开幕词。
    大会随后批准了执行委员会关于党在过去两年中的活动的总结报告。
    共产党总书记波立特作了党的执行委员会的政治报告。
    波立特主张英国的外交政策应该采取下列方针：达成关于无所不包的欧洲安全体系的协定和能够防止德国军国主义复活的关于德国问题的协定，禁止核子武器，禁止今后试验这种武器和采纳大家同意的裁军计划，大大减少军费，停止一切殖民战争，给殖民地国家人民以独立，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利和取消同社会主义国家贸易中的政治性限制。
    波立特谈到英国经济状况的时候说，军费过于庞大使英国经济的发展畸形化。同时，英国在国外市场上碰到越来越激烈的竞争。
    波立特提出了党的斗争纲领，包括争取增加工人的工资，反对缩减生产和失业现象，争取发展东西方之间的贸易，争取减少军费，增加富有者的赋税和扩大社会服务。
    波立特说，只有统一的工人运动才能实现这个纲领。他向工党提出一致行动的要求。
    大会随后就波立特的报告进行了讨论。许多发言者着重指出必须加强工人运动的团结一致，并且举出了工党党员和共产党员在争取满足劳动人民的经济要求的斗争中一致行动的许多例子。
