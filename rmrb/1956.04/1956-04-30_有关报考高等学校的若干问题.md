Answering Readers' Questions about Applying for Higher Education Institutions

Recently, many young people applying for higher education institutions have written to inquire about some specific questions regarding applying for higher education institutions. Now, comprehensive answers are provided below:

Q: Some agencies have not received instructions from their direct leadership organs forwarding the State Council's directive on guaranteeing the completion of this year's higher education enrollment plan. What should be done?

A: The State Council's "Directive on Guaranteeing the Completion of This Year's Higher Education Enrollment Plan" has been issued nationwide and simultaneously published in the People's Daily, Guangming Daily, and local newspapers. All agencies should implement the provisions in the directive, actively support or transfer cadres to apply, and help applicant cadres to review high school courses. Some agencies believe that they have not received instructions from their direct leadership organs and do not actively help cadres apply in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's directive. This practice is incorrect and should be corrected.

Q: Is there a restriction on the length of service for cadres in government agencies when applying?

A: Regardless of the length of service, cadres in government agencies (including those on probation), as long as they meet the requirements, can apply for higher education institutions. Those who are not admitted will return to their original work units.

Q: Can teachers from secondary schools and secondary normal schools apply for higher education institutions? Are there any restrictions on the majors they can apply for?

A: Teachers from secondary schools and secondary normal schools (including vocational spare-time middle schools and middle schools for cadres), as long as they meet the application requirements, can apply for higher education institutions. There are no restrictions on the majors and departments they can apply for.

Q: Can students from short-term training courses organized by various government agencies and factories, or students from short-term training courses that will be completed before the registration and examination for higher education institutions, apply for higher education institutions?

A: Students currently enrolled in short-term training courses organized by various government agencies and factories cannot apply for higher education institutions. They should complete their study plans according to the training requirements of their respective departments and participate in construction work. Students who will graduate before the specified health examination time (June 15th) should obtain approval from their affiliated units before applying.

Q: Can young people who have been undergraduates or specialized course students at higher education institutions, whether they have dropped out or graduated, apply for higher education institutions?

A: Generally, those who dropped out of undergraduate programs at higher education institutions within two years, those who have not graduated from two-year specialized courses, and those who have graduated from specialized courses of less than two years can apply for higher education institutions. Those who have dropped out of undergraduate programs at higher education institutions for more than two years and those who have graduated from two-year specialized courses already possess a relatively high level of cultural and scientific knowledge and are qualified to work, so there is no need to reapply for higher education institutions.

Q: Can people who have withdrawn from school due to illness or who have certain diseases or physical defects apply for higher education institutions?

A: Higher education students who have withdrawn from school due to illness can reapply for higher education institutions as long as they have recovered their health and passed the examination by a designated hospital. Whether people with physical illnesses can apply depends on the specific situation. People with certain minor illnesses and physical defects (excluding chronic and infectious diseases) may still be able to apply. Because the health requirements for various majors in higher education institutions are not completely consistent, this can only be determined during registration and examination.

Q: How should in-service mid-level professional cadres apply for higher education institutions?

A: In-service mid-level professional cadres possess certain professional knowledge and are important technical forces in current production and work. In order to expand the source of students, actively cultivate senior professional cadres, and at the same time avoid excessively affecting production and work, therefore, according to the State Council's "Directive on Guaranteeing the Completion of This Year's Higher Education Enrollment Plan," the issue of in-service mid-level professional cadres (excluding those engaged in financial and economic work and agricultural technical work) and this year's graduates of secondary professional schools (excluding graduates of secondary normal schools) belonging to the central departments' factories and mines and the health system applying for higher education institutions will be addressed through a planned transfer approach.

In-service mid-level professional cadres outside the planned transfer (including those who originally graduated from secondary professional schools or who have the level of mid-level professional cadres after training), if they are currently engaged in technical work or teaching and scientific research auxiliary work, such as mid-level professional cadres in design institutions of industrial and transportation departments and local factories and mines, teaching assistants and scientific research work assistants in laboratories and training factories of higher education institutions and scientific research institutions, and teachers teaching professional courses in secondary professional schools (excluding mid-level professional cadres engaged in financial and economic work and agricultural technical work), they should apply to their units and obtain leadership approval to apply for higher education institutions.

As for those who originally graduated from secondary professional schools or who have the level of mid-level professional cadres after training, if they are currently engaged in non-technical work, they are free to apply for higher education institutions.

Q: Why do mid-level professional cadres and secondary professional school graduates have to take separate examinations?

A: The characteristic of mid-level professional cadres and secondary professional school graduates is that they possess certain professional knowledge, but their level of basic scientific knowledge is generally not as high as that of general high school graduates. If they participate in the unified examination, they will have fewer opportunities for admission. However, this group of people has professional knowledge, and entering higher education institutions to study in the same type of major, they can not only keep up with classes, but their academic performance is often better. Therefore, in order to adapt to the characteristics of this group of people and take into account the requirements of various departments for their continued professional training, it has been decided that the designated higher education institutions will conduct separate examinations. In this way, the higher education institutions accepting applications can conduct basic courses and professional courses suitable for the academic level of this group of people according to the requirements of different majors, so that this group of candidates can obtain more admission opportunities. With the consent of the higher education institutions accepting them, secondary professional schools can also recommend outstanding students from this year's graduates for admission without examination.

As for in-service mid-level professional cadres who apply without planned transfer, because they are scattered across the country, and the number of applicants, expertise, and application aspirations cannot be summarized in the shortest possible time, it is difficult to formulate a plan for selecting and sending applicants. Therefore, they should participate in the unified enrollment examination.

Currently, various business departments are formulating plans for selecting and sending this year's graduates of secondary professional schools and in-service mid-level professional cadres to apply for higher education institutions. After this plan is issued, the sending units and relevant higher education institutions can be linked up and can further discuss and determine examination subjects, examination dates, and other matters.

    有关报考高等学校的若干问题
    最近，不少报考高等学校的青年来信询问有关报考高等学校的一些具体问题，现在综合答复如下：
    问：有些机关没有接到直属领导机关转发国务院关于保证完成今年高等学校招生计划的指示，应该如何办？
    答：国务院“关于保证完成今年高等学校招生计划的指示”已经下达全国各地，并在人民日报、光明日报和各地方报纸同时公布了。各机关应该按照指示中的规定执行，积极支持或抽调干部报考，并且帮助报考干部补习高中课程。有的机关认为没有接到直属领导机关的指示而不积极按国务院指示的精神帮助干部报考，这种做法是不对的，应该改正。
    问：机关在职干部报考时是否有工作年限的限制？
    答：机关在职干部（包括试用人员）不管工作年限长短，只要符合条件，都可以报考高等学校。未被录取的一律回原单位工作。
    问：中等学校和中等师范学校的教师能不能报考高等学校？报考的专业有没有限制？
    答：中等学校教师和中等师范学校教师（包括职工业余中学和机关干部中学）只要符合报考条件，都可以报考高等学校，报考的专业系科并没有限制。
    问：各机关厂矿举办的短期训练班学员或在高等学校报名考试前即可结业的短期训练班学员，能不能报考高等学校？
    答：凡是各机关厂矿短期训练班在学的学员，都不能报考高等学校；他们应该按照各部门训练的要求完成学习计划，参加建设工作。对于在规定的健康检查时间（六月十五日）以前结业的学员，应当经过所属单位的组织批准，才能报考。
    问：曾在高等学校的本科或专修科肄业、毕业的青年能不能报考高等学校？
    答：一般在高等学校本科肄业没有超过两年的，在两年制专修科没有毕业的和不足两年的专修科毕业的，都可以报考高等学校。高等学校本科肄业两年以上的和二年制专修科毕业的，因为已经具有较高的文化科学知识，有条件工作，所以不必重新报考高等学校。
    问：曾因病退学和有某些疾病或生理缺陷的人能不能报考高等学校？
    答：因病退学的高等学校学生，只要恢复了健康，经过指定的医院检查合格，就可以重新报考高等学校。身体有病的人能不能报考要看具体情况，如有某些轻微疾病和生理缺陷的人（慢性病和传染病除外）还有可能报考。因为高等学校各专业对健康条件的要求并不是完全一致的，这要到报名检查时才能确定。
    问：在职的中级专业干部应该怎样报考高等学校？
    答：在职的中级专业干部，具有一定的专业知识，是目前生产和工作中重要的技术力量。为了扩大学生来源，积极培养高级专业干部，同时避免过多地影响生产和工作，因此，根据国务院“关于保证完成今年高等学校招生计划的指示”，对于中央各部门所属厂矿和卫生系统的在职的中级专业干部（不包括做财经工作和农业技术工作的中级专业干部）和中等专业学校今年毕业生（不包括中等师范学校毕业生）报考高等学校的问题，采取有计划抽调的办法。
    在计划抽调以外的在职的中级专业干部（包括原来是中等专业学校毕业的或者是一般干部经过训练而已经具有中级专业干部水平的人），如果目前担任技术性工作或教学、科学研究的辅助工作，如工业、交通运输部门的设计机构和地方厂矿的中级专业干部、高等学校和科学研究机构中实验室、实习工厂的教学辅助人员和科学研究工作的辅助人员、中等专业学校毕业在中等专业学校教专业课的教师等（不包括做财经工作、农业技术工作的中级专业干部），他们要报考高等学校，应该向本单位申请和经过领导批准。
    至于虽然原来是中等专业学校毕业的，或者经过训练具有中级专业干部水平的，如果他们目前担任非技术性的工作，都可以自由报考高等学校。
    问：中级专业干部和中等专业学校毕业生为什么要单独进行考试？
    答：中级专业干部和中等专业学校毕业生的特点是具有一定的专业知识，但是一般基础科学知识水平则不如一般高中毕业生。如果让他们参加统一考试，录取的机会就比较少。可是，这部分人有专业知识，进入高等学校相同性质专业学习，不但可以跟班上课，而且学习成绩往往是比较优秀的。因此，为了适应这部分人的特点和照顾各部门对他们继续进行专业培养的要求，决定由指定报考的各高等学校单独进行考试。这样，就可以由接受报考的各高等学校根据不同专业的要求，进行适合这部分人学业水平的基础课和专业课的考试，使这部分考生可以获得更多的录取机会。中等专业学校经过接受的高等学校同意，还可以保送本年毕业生中的优秀生免试入学。
    至于未经计划抽调而报考的在职中级专业干部，由于他们分散全国各地，报考人数、专长和报考志愿等不可能在最短期内加以汇总，难以制定选送报考方案。因此，他们应该参加统一招生考试。
    目前各业务部门正在拟制选送中等专业学校今年毕业生和在职的中级专业干部报考高等学校方案，这个方案下达以后，选送单位和有关高等学校就可以挂上钩，并且可以进一步商量并确定考试科目、考试日期以及其他事项。
