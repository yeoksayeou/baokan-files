Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 31st. According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian President Sukarno on March 30th once again called on all parties and people from all walks of life to support the abolition of all Round Table Conference Agreements signed with the Netherlands.

　　Sukarno made this call at a mass rally of 100,000 people in Salatiga, Central Java. He said that he believed that the Indonesian people, who had been able to declare independence and withstand the severe test of many counter-revolutionary attempts, would be able to deal with all possible consequences arising from the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement. He hoped that the new parliament would discuss the bill to abolish all Round Table Conference Agreements.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 29th. Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo wrote to the parliament on March 28th, informing them that President Sukarno had refused to sign the draft law on the abolition of the Indonesian-Dutch Union, which was passed by the Provisional Parliament in February. This draft law, proposed by the former Harahap Cabinet, was hastily passed at a time when members of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, and the Islamic Teachers Association withdrew from the parliament.

　　The letter stated that Sukarno refused to sign the bill because "for the interests of the nation and the country, such an important bill should have been submitted to a popularly elected parliament for approval." The letter stated that the government would soon submit a new bill to the parliament to abolish all Round Table Conference Agreements.

    苏加诺号召印度尼西亚人民支持废除圆桌会议协定
    新华社雅加达31日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在三月三十日再次号召各党派和各阶层人民支持废除同荷兰签订的全部圆桌会议协定。
    苏加诺是在中爪哇沙拉笛加的十万人的群众大会上发出这个号召的。他说，他相信曾经有能力宣布独立并且经得起许多次反革命企图的严重考验的印度尼西亚人民，将能够对付废除圆桌会议协定所引起的一切可能的后果。他希望新的国会将讨论废除全部圆桌会议协定的法案。
    据新华社雅加达29日电　印度尼西亚新政府总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约在三月二十八日写信通知国会说，苏加诺总统已经拒绝签署临时国会二月间通过的废除印度尼西亚—荷兰联邦的法案草案。这个由前哈拉哈普内阁提出的法案草案，当时是在印度尼西亚国民党、印度尼西亚共产党和回教师联合会三大政党议员退出议会会场的情况下草草通过的。
    这封信说，苏加诺拒绝签署法案的理由是：“为了民族和国家的利益，这样重要的法案原该提交民选的国会通过”。信中说，政府不久之后将向国会提出废除全部圆桌会议协定的新法案。
