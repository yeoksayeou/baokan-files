Wheat fields in various regions have generally been harrowed once, and some have been harrowed two to three times. In Anyi County, the daily labor force participating in weeding reached more than 35,000 people, and 65,000 mu of wheat were weeded in three days.

    晋南农民积极捕灭麦蜘蛛
    山西省晋南地区近来在小麦地里，发现了麦蜘蛛为害。据平川十个县统计已有六十万亩麦田发生了麦蜘蛛。各地在发现虫害后，广泛地结合耙麦、锄麦进行了除治，各地麦田已经普遍耙过一遍，并有一部分进行二至三次耙耱。安邑县每天参加锄麦的劳动力达三万五千多人，三天锄麦六万五千多亩，为了达到及早除治，各地已调运大批药剂，进行药剂喷杀。
