    Using Comparative Methods for Technical Demonstrations

    In early February, the Shenyang Transformer Factory's metalworking shop, in order to promote advanced experience, invited lathe operator Liu Ruisen to demonstrate his single-tool, five-flute operating experience, and lathe operator Zhi Qiyong to demonstrate six advanced experiences such as high-speed cutting (they had previously increased production efficiency by 11.5 and 7 times respectively). At first, Liu Ruisen operated according to the old method, taking five minutes and eighteen seconds to process a "pipe cap"; the second time, using the new operation method, he combined the original five processes into one, and processed a "pipe cap" in just forty-five seconds. Zhi Qiyong also used a comparative method for his demonstration. After each demonstration, the shop's technicians would explain the benefits of the advanced experience to the visitors in detail, and conduct technical appraisals and time studies on the spot.

    According to the original quota calculations, the metalworking shop was still 20,000 man-hours short of completing its February task. However, shortly after the technical demonstrations, 92% of the lathe operators mastered the high-speed cutting experience, and increased production efficiency by 150% on seventy-one types of parts. Each worker exceeded the quota by an average of 40.2%, and the problem of insufficient man-hours was solved. This shows that using comparative methods for technical demonstrations and on-the-spot appraisals of advanced experience is a very good method. From February 7th to March 1st, the transformer factory's ten workshops all used the same method to promote advanced experience in fifteen types of work such as assembly, cutting, welding, and coil winding.

    用对比法表演技术
    二月初，沈阳变压器厂金工车间为了推广先进经验，请车工柳瑞森表演单刀五刃操作经验，请车工支启勇表演快速切削等六种先进经验（他们曾分别提高生产效率十一倍半和七倍）。柳瑞森一开始仍旧按照老办法操作，共用五分十八秒加工一个“管帽”；第二次用新操作法，把原来五道工序并为一道工序，用四十五秒钟就加工好一个“管帽”。支启勇也用对比的方法进行了表演。每一次表演以后，车间技术员就详细地给参观者讲解先进经验的好处，并且当场作技术鉴定和工时标定。
    按原来定额计算，金工车间要完成二月份任务还差二万个工时。但是在技术表演不久，92％的车工都掌握了高速切削经验，并且在七十一种部件上提高生产效率150％。每个工人平均突破定额40.2％，工时不足的问题就解决了。这说明：用对比法进行技术表演和当场鉴定先进经验，是一个很好的办法。从二月七日到三月一日，变压器厂的十个车间，都用同样的方法推广了装配、切削、焊接、卷线等十五个工种的先进经验。
