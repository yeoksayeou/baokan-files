Spring Wheat Sowing Basically Completed, Rice Transplanting in Full Swing

The spring sowing activities are in full swing across the country, from south to north. Currently, the spring wheat sowing work in wheat-producing areas has basically been completed. In rice-producing areas, early and mid-season rice in the Yangtze River basin have entered the stages of raising seedlings and transplanting, and provinces with earlier seasons such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian are transplanting in full swing. Cotton in major cotton-producing provinces such as Hebei, Henan, and Shandong has also been basically sown, and cotton seedlings sown earlier have already emerged. In addition, grain crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, and millet, as well as economic crops such as peanuts, tobacco, and hemp, are being sown and cultivated in various places.

This year, due to the great development of the cooperative movement, farmers' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. The sowing period in various places is generally seven to fifteen days earlier than last year, and scientific technologies and advanced experiences have been promoted in spring sowing. Advanced experiences in seed selection, suitable seedbeds, and sparse sowing to cultivate strong seedlings have been widely promoted in rice areas. Rice seeds in Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and other provinces have generally undergone mud and salt water selection, and many rice seeds have also adopted sodium bicarbonate soaking. Many agricultural production cooperatives have fixed experienced and skilled members to manage seedbeds, and the seedlings are growing vigorously, greatly reducing the phenomenon of seedling rot. This year, almost all the cotton seeds sown in various places have been selected by grain, and more than 100 million jin of cotton seeds have also been treated with chemical fumigation. Many areas have adopted the advanced technology of cotton square seedling raising in cotton fields. Various places have also focused on promoting the yield-increasing technology of dense planting and full seedlings.

This year, the sown area of improved varieties of grain, cotton, and oil crops nationwide will be expanded by more than 200 million mu compared with last year.

Using Underground Water to Combat Drought and Transplant Rice

Xinhua News Agency report: In Hailing District, Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, where there has been no heavy rain for more than six consecutive months, the fields are now full of green rice seedlings. This is a new scene after the Hailing District Committee of the Communist Party of China led farmers to eliminate the drought.

Before spring farming this year, the Hailing District Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the characteristics of the local drought and decided to solve the irrigation problem by excavating underground water sources. Fourteen district committee members went to the fields to conduct on-the-spot surveys and worked with farmers to formulate a specific plan to eliminate the drought of "digging a pingtang (wide well) for every 30 mu of land." Each district committee member also frequently led cadres to go to the fields to check the method, quantity, and specifications of pingtang excavation, and to grasp the water management of the pingtang. More than 1,600 pingtangs that have been excavated recently have formed an irrigation network in the 11 townships of the district, irrigating more than 20,000 mu of rice fields that are short of water. Rice fields that would have been abandoned in previous years due to minor droughts can now be transplanted with the help of underground water sources.

Ethnic Minorities Use New Farm Tools

Xinhua News Agency report: Farmers of all ethnic groups on the west bank of the Nujiang River in Yunnan Province, who historically practiced "slash-and-burn cultivation," are using new farm tools for the first time. A few days ago, in the wheat fields of Mangshi Dam in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, the horse-drawn rocker harvester of the Luxi Youth Collective Farm began to harvest wheat. The harvester drove back and forth in the field, and in the blink of an eye, large tracts of wheat were neatly cut down on the ground. Many Dai farmers who came to watch praised in surprise. Now, more than 60 pieces of new-style farm tools, such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, spiked-tooth harrows, and seeders, have been distributed to agricultural production cooperatives in various counties.

Hainan Island Sows Mid-Season Rice

The first crop of rice in Wanning County and Lehui County, Hainan Island, is generally grouting and setting grain. Farmers in Wanning County are sowing mid-season rice, and the county's planned area for mid-season rice will expand from more than 1,000 mu last year to more than 14,000 mu. (Southern Daily)

Vegetables Grow Well in the Suburbs of Beijing

The spring sowing work of two state-owned farms and the joint state-private Dongjiao Livestock Farm in the suburbs of Beijing has basically ended. The cabbage in the Xijiao Farm is growing very vigorously and can be harvested and put on the market in another 20 days. Eggplants, green peppers, and tomatoes have also been sown and are being separated. (Chen Zhenghu, et al.) (with picture)

    全力进行春耕生产
    春麦播种基本结束、水稻插秧紧张进行
    全国由南到北的春耕播种活动正在紧张进行。目前，产麦区的春麦播种工作已经基本结束。在产稻区，长江流域的早、中稻已进入育秧和插秧阶段，季节较早的广东、广西、福建等省正在紧张插秧。主要产棉区河北、河南、山东等省的棉花也基本播种完毕，播种早的棉苗已经出土。此外，各地的玉米、薯类、谷子等粮食作物和花生、烟、麻等经济作物都正在播种和育苗中。
    今年由于合作化运动的大发展，农民生产情绪空前高涨。各地的播种期一般比去年提早七天到十五天左右，而且在春播中推广了科学技术和先进经验。在水稻地区普遍推广了选种、合式秧田和稀播培育壮秧的先进经验。湖北、江西、江苏等省的稻种普遍进行了泥水、盐水选种，不少稻种还采用了小苏打浸种。很多农业生产合作社都固定由有经验、有技术的社员管理秧田，秧苗长得茁壮，大大地减少了烂秧现象。今年各地播种的棉花种籽几乎全部经过粒选，其中一亿多斤的棉种还进行了药剂熏蒸。很多地区的棉田都采用了棉花方格育苗的先进技术。各地还着重推广了密植全苗的增产技术。
    今年全国粮食、棉花和油料作物等良种播种面积，将比去年扩大两亿多亩。
    利用地下水源抗旱插秧
    在连续六个多月没下过大雨的广东省阳江县海陵区，现在田野里却长满了一片青绿色的稻秧。这是中共海陵区委员会领导农民消除旱灾以后出现的新景象。
    今年春耕前，中共海陵区委员会研究了当地旱患的特点后，决定以挖掘地下水源的方法来解决灌溉问题。十四个区委委员分头深入到田间进行实地查勘，与农民共同制定了“三十亩田挖一个平塘（宽阔的井）”的消除旱灾具体规划。每个区委委员还经常率领干部深入到田间去检查挖掘平塘的方法、数量和规格，掌握平塘的用水管理情况。最近挖成的一千六百多个平塘，在全区十一个乡形成一个灌溉网，灌溉着缺水的两万多亩稻田。往年每遇小旱也要荒芜的稻田，现在靠地下水源便能插秧。（据新华社讯）
    少数民族使用新农具
    历史上“刀耕火种”的云南省怒江西岸的各族农民，第一次使用新式农具。几天以前，在德宏傣族景颇族自治区芒市坝的麦地里，潞西青年集体农庄的马拉摇臂收割机开始割麦。收割机在地里往来行驶、一转眼，就把大片麦子整齐地割倒在地上。许多前来观看的傣族农民，都惊喜地称赞着。现在，六十多件双轮双铧犁、钉齿耙、播种机等新式农具，已分发到各县农业生产合作社。（据新华社讯）
    海南岛播种中稻
    海南岛万宁县和乐会县的第一造水稻普遍灌浆结谷。万宁县农民正在播种中造水稻，全县中造水稻的面积计划由去年的一千多亩，扩大到一万四千多亩。（南方日报）
    京郊蔬菜生长良好
    北京市郊区两个国营农场和公私合营东郊畜牧场的春播工作已经基本结束。西郊农场的洋白菜长得很茁壮，再过二十天便可以收获上市。茄子、青辣椒、西红柿也播种完毕，正在分苗。（陈正湖等）（附图片）
