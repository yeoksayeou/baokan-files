    Planned Vigorous Development of Philosophical Research
    Pan Zinian, Director of the Institute of Philosophy, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Carrying out Marxist philosophical research has universal guiding significance for the development of the entire scientific enterprise. The Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, in the course of the Chinese revolution, combined the principles of Marxist philosophy with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and made many unique contributions to the cause of revolution and socialist construction, enriching the treasure house of Marxist philosophy. The victory of our revolution proved the great power of Marxist philosophical thought. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, our philosophical circles have made some achievements, especially the criticism of bourgeois idealism initiated by the Party Central Committee, which has had a great impact, promoted the progress of philosophical circles, enhanced our ideological combat effectiveness, and also promoted the formation of a philosophical contingent. Philosophical workers have also done a lot of work in the positions of research, teaching, editing, and translation. However, the development of our philosophical work is still far behind the actual needs, which is still a fact that everyone is very anxious about. At present, the team engaged in philosophical research is still very small, and there is a particular lack of philosophical experts with certain research results, and many disciplines in philosophy are still blank and weak. This situation is not commensurate with our large country and is very incompatible with the speed of our socialist development. Therefore, we must vigorously develop philosophical research work, and we must conduct comprehensive planning, formulate a twelve-year development perspective plan, and take a series of specific measures to ensure its realization. We have the correct ideological leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, rich revolutionary experience and philosophical and cultural heritage, a good tradition of studying theory, and the help of Soviet philosophical circles. In the past few years, many staff members and intellectuals in our country have become interested in philosophical research, and new forces in philosophical circles are growing rapidly. These are all favorable conditions for carrying out philosophical research.

    According to the needs of our socialist construction and the needs of philosophy itself in our country, the tasks of philosophical research work in the next twelve years should be: to study the classic works of Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, to study the party's policies and revolutionary experience in various periods, to elaborate and sort out the philosophical and cultural heritage, to criticize bourgeois ideology, and so on, in order to carry out materialist propaganda and education to the people, and at the same time to take various specific measures to cultivate sufficient philosophical work cadres. Through these tasks, we will lay a good foundation for Marxist-Leninist philosophical research work, so as to cooperate with the high tide of socialist culture in our country, and enable some major disciplines of philosophy in our country to reach the international advanced level.

    In order to achieve this goal, we should strengthen leadership and carry out the following tasks:

    1. Cultivate cadres and expand the team. According to preliminary statistics, there are only several hundred philosophical workers in our country who are equivalent to assistant researchers and lecturers or above, and the proportion of philosophical experts above associate researchers and associate professors is very small, and there are not many people who can lead graduate students to conduct special research at present. In addition, the existing forces have not been fully used and brought into play, and some people who specialize in philosophy are still "not using what they have learned" and "not using what they are good at"; this waste of human resources should be changed. The existing philosophical research institutions are extremely unsound, with few senior and intermediate researchers, and the number of graduates that university philosophy departments can train each year is extremely limited. This human situation is far from meeting the needs of our tasks. Therefore, we must greatly strengthen and expand the existing philosophical team. On the one hand, we must concentrate manpower and give full play to each person's strengths; on the other hand, we must vigorously cultivate new forces and increase the number of students in philosophy departments.

    2. Strengthen weak links and fill in blank disciplines. At present, two-thirds of the number of philosophical workers are concentrated in the research of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and the history of Chinese philosophy. As for many other important disciplines of philosophy, such as dialectical logic, dialectical materialism and modern natural science, the history of oriental philosophy, various special histories of philosophy (such as the history of materialism, the history of dialectics, the history of logic, the history of social thought, the history of ethical thought, the history of religion, etc.), ethics, aesthetics, etc., the number of people studying is very small, and some are completely blank. We must establish specialized institutions and allocate considerable manpower in the future to eliminate blank spots. As for those disciplines with weak foundations, they should also be enriched and strengthened.

    3. Publish specialized works and sort out philosophical heritage. Our specialized philosophical works are extremely lacking, and the level is generally not high. In addition to Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" and other creative Marxist philosophical works with international standards, we can hardly come up with an outstanding work that reaches the international level. Judging from this situation, the research results of the philosophical circles in our country are not many. Our country is a country with a rich philosophical heritage, and many outstanding materialists and dialectical thinkers have emerged in history. But so far, we do not have a complete history of Chinese philosophy using Marxist viewpoints. Therefore, we must organize philosophical circles across the country to conduct special research separately, and gradually write specialized works in the next few years. We must also carry out the collection, sorting, compilation, and translation of various philosophical works and materials from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. In translation work, the most important task is the translation of Marxist philosophical classics. Contemporary Marxist philosophical works from the Soviet Union and other countries, as well as foreign philosophical classics, should also be translated. In addition, we must also carry out the modern translation of ancient books and compile a Chinese philosophical dictionary.

    4. Publish popular readings and compile textbooks. Compiling textbooks suitable for Chinese philosophical teaching is an urgent task, because classic works are not easy for beginners to understand, and textbooks compiled by the Soviet Union cannot fully meet the needs of Chinese students. We must first compile the following textbooks: "Philosophy Textbook," "Dialectical Materialism Textbook," "Historical Materialism Textbook," "Chinese Philosophy History Textbook," "Western Philosophy History Textbook," "Formal Logic Textbook," and so on. In addition, we should also write a batch of popular philosophical readings. These readings must have Chinese characteristics, must make full use of materials from the Chinese revolutionary struggle and production struggle, and must be in line with the personal experience of the broad masses of the people, so that everyone can easily understand and accept them, so as to carry out dialectical materialist education to the broad masses of the people.

    At present, the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences is convening a group of experts to discuss and formulate a draft of a twelve-year perspective plan for philosophical research. We hope that this plan, after it is formulated and adopted, can play a mobilizing and guiding role for the philosophical circles across the country, unite the philosophical workers across the country, divide the labor and cooperate, and march toward science in a big way.

    有计划地大力开展哲学研究工作
    中国科学院哲学研究所所长　潘梓年
    开展马克思主义哲学研究工作，对于整个科学事业的发展具有普遍的指导意义。中国共产党和毛泽东同志在中国革命过程中，将马克思主义哲学原理和中国革命具体实践相结合，对革命和社会主义建设事业作出了许多独特的贡献，丰富了马克思主义哲学的宝库。我国革命的胜利，证明了马克思主义哲学思想的巨大威力。中华人民共和国建立以来，我们的哲学界是有一些成绩的，特别是党中央发起的对资产阶级唯心主义的批判，产生了很大的影响，推动了哲学界前进，提高了我们的思想战斗力，也促进了哲学队伍的形成。哲学工作者在研究、教学、编辑、翻译的工作岗位上也做了不少的工作。但是，我国哲学工作的发展还远远落在实际需要的后面，这仍然是使大家都很着急的事实。目前从事哲学研究的队伍还很小，具有一定研究成果的哲学专家特别缺乏，哲学中的许多学科还是空白的和薄弱的。这种情况同我们这样一个大国是不相称的，同我们的社会主义发展速度是很不相适应的。因此，我们必须大力开展哲学研究工作，必须进行全面规划，制定一个十二年发展远景计划，并采取一系列的具体措施，来保证它的实现。我们有中国共产党和毛泽东同志的正确的思想领导，有丰富的革命经验和哲学文化遗产，有学习理论的优良传统，有苏联哲学界的帮助，几年来我国许多工作人员和知识分子对哲学研究工作都发生了兴趣，哲学界的新生力量正在迅速成长起来。这些都是开展哲学研究的有利条件。
    根据我国社会主义建设事业的需要和我国哲学本身的需要，在十二年内，哲学研究工作的任务应该是：研究马克思列宁主义的经典著作和毛泽东同志的著作，研究各个时期党的政策和革命的经验，阐发、整理哲学文化遗产，批判资产阶级思想，等等，用以向人民群众进行唯物主义的宣传教育，同时为培养足够的哲学工作干部采取各项具体措施。通过这些工作，来为马克思列宁主义的哲学研究工作打下良好的基础，以配合我国社会主义文化高潮，并使我国哲学的某些主要学科达到国际的先进水平。
    为了达到这个目的，我们应该加强领导，进行如下一些工作：
    一、培养干部，扩大队伍。根据初步统计材料，我国相当于助理研究员和讲师以上的哲学工作者只有数百人，其中副研究员和副教授以上的哲学专家占的比例很小，在目前能领导研究生进行专题研究的人也不多。此外，现有的力量也并没有充分地使用和发挥起来，有些专学哲学的人至今还是“学非所用”“用非所长”；这种浪费人力的情况是应当改变的。现有哲学研究机构极不健全，高级和中级的研究人员既少，而大学哲学系每年所能培养出来的毕业生又极有限。这种人力的情况是远远不能适应我们的任务的需要的，因此，必须大大加强和扩充现有的哲学队伍。一方面，我们要集中人力，发挥各人所长；另一方面，要大力培养新生力量，增加哲学系的学生名额。
    二、加强薄弱环节，填补空白学科。目前哲学工作者有三分之二的人数集中在辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义、中国哲学史的研究上，至于哲学的其他许多重要学科，如辩证逻辑、辩证唯物主义与现代自然科学、东方哲学史、哲学的各种专史（如唯物主义史、辩证法史、逻辑史、社会思想史、伦理思想史、宗教史等）、伦理学、美学等方面，研究的人数很少，有的还完全是空白。我们必须在今后增设专门机构，配备相当人力，消灭空白点。至于那些基础薄弱的学科，也要予以充实和加强。
    三、出版专门著作，整理哲学遗产。我们的哲学专门著作异常缺少，而且水平一般也不高。除了毛泽东同志的“实践论”“矛盾论”等具有国际水平的创造性的马克思主义哲学著作以外，我们简直拿不出一本够上国际水平的杰出的著作。从这种情况看，我国哲学界的研究成果是不多的。我国是有丰富的哲学遗产的国家，历史上曾经出现了许多卓越的唯物主义者和辩证思想家。但是至今我们还没有一部完善的运用马克思主义观点的中国哲学史。因此，我们必须组织全国哲学界分头进行专题研究，在今后若干年内陆续撰写出专门的著作来。我们还必须进行古今中外各种哲学著作和资料的搜集、整理、编纂和翻译工作。在翻译工作中，最重要的一项是马克思主义哲学经典著作的翻译。苏联和其他国家的当代马克思主义哲学著作以及外国的哲学古典著作也要翻译过来。此外，我们还要进行古书今译和编纂中国哲学辞典的工作。
    四、出版通俗读物，编写教科书。编写适应中国哲学教学的教科书，是一项迫切的工作，因为经典著作不便于初学者理解，而苏联编写的教科书又不能完全适合中国学员的需要。我们首先要编写下面几种教科书：“哲学教科书”“辩证唯物主义教科书”“历史唯物主义教科书”“中国哲学史教科书”“西方哲学史教科书”“形式逻辑教科书”等。此外，我们还应写出一批通俗的哲学读物，这种读物必须具有中国气派，必须充分运用中国革命斗争和生产斗争中的材料，切合广大人民的亲身体验，使大家易于了解，易于接受，以便对广大人民进行辩证唯物主义的教育。
    目前，科学院哲学研究所正在召集一批专家，商讨和制定哲学研究的十二年远景规划草案。我们希望，这个规划在制定出来和通过以后，能够对全国哲学界起动员和指导的作用，使全国哲学工作者团结起来，分工合作，向科学大进军。
