　　Reasonable Concerns

　　Sixteen Asian and African countries' representatives to the United Nations jointly wrote to the Security Council on April 16, accusing the French authorities of not only refusing to negotiate with the representatives of the Algerian people to meet their legitimate demands, but also intensifying the use of force to implement its suppression policy. They solemnly pointed out that the situation in Algeria is a threat to peace and security and violates the basic right to self-determination and flagrantly violates other basic human rights. This letter from the sixteen Asian and African countries speaks for all people who love peace and justice.
　　The recent developments in the Algerian situation cannot but cause deep concern. Because France is unwilling to adopt a more realistic attitude in Algeria, as it did in resolving the issues of Morocco and Tunisia, refusing to use negotiations to promote a ceasefire in order to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue, but instead continuously sends more troops and strengthens military suppression measures, resulting in increasingly frequent and fierce armed conflicts, an increasing number of people being massacred, and an increasingly tense situation, which also deteriorates the relationship between France and some Arab countries. If the situation in Algeria continues to deteriorate, it will seriously endanger peace and security in the Mediterranean and North African regions, and have a very negative impact on the entire cause of easing international tensions. People have noticed signs of certain international forces attempting to use the tensions in the Mediterranean and North African regions to conduct provocations and expansion, which gives even more reason to be concerned about this situation. This development of events will by no means be beneficial to France either.
　　The people of Asian and African countries have always been very concerned about the situation in Algeria. The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung last year solemnly declared its support for the cause of the Algerian people in their struggle for freedom and independence, and demanded that the French government promptly promote a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue based on the recognition of the Algerian people's right to self-determination and independence. There is no reason why this common desire and will of 1.6 billion people should not be valued by the French government. Thanks to the efforts of Asian and African countries, the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly decided to include the Algerian issue on the agenda. Later, representatives of Asian and African countries agreed to temporarily not discuss the Algerian issue at that session, and hoped that France would take measures to seek a satisfactory solution to this issue through negotiations. But regrettably, this desire unanimously expressed by Asian and African countries has not received due attention from the French authorities to this day.
　　French Prime Minister Mollet recently repeatedly emphasized: "We will never use force to force the Algerian people to accept a solution. We will never allow violence to achieve a solution." Those who are truly concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue will welcome this opinion. However, good intentions will lose their meaning if they are not supported by actions. To rely on overwhelming military superiority and brutal massacres to make people who demand independence stop resisting the struggle against colonialist suppression is itself a manifestation of power politics and colonialism, and runs counter to the principles of peace and recognition of national self-determination. Demanding that the people of Algeria, who are fighting for independence, surrender and accept French military rule in Algeria as a prerequisite for starting peace negotiations can only, in effect, exclude negotiations on the basis of equality and mutual respect to restore peace in Algeria and realize Algeria's national self-determination. If Mollet's words truly express France's willingness to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue, then France should obviously not send more troops and intensify "sweeping-up" operations, but should try to ease the situation there and create a peaceful atmosphere to pave the way for fair negotiations. Everyone can see that it is France, not the Algerian people, who is now refusing to start peace negotiations immediately and is putting forward unilateral conditions for holding negotiations. This, of course, will never win France the sympathy of public opinion. Only by respecting the national rights of the Algerian people and handling the issue through peaceful negotiations rather than military suppression can the issue be resolved, and this solution will also be in the interests of France and the interests of peace. The precedents of Morocco and Tunisia have powerfully proved this point. It is futile to insist that the Algerian issue is different from the issues of Morocco and Tunisia. France's practice of strengthening military measures in Algeria is facing increasingly widespread opposition within France. This shows that the broad masses of the French people clearly see what is the real way to solve the Algerian issue. Not long ago, a delegation from the National Committee for Peaceful Resolution of the North African Issue in France investigated and studied the situation in Algeria and concluded: "France's interests are definitely not in waging a new colonial war. Only by establishing friendly and brotherly ties with Algeria can these interests be maintained. … This is a freely agreed union, with mutual respect and on a basis of absolute equality. The prerequisite for achieving this is to satisfy the national aspirations of the Algerian people." This conclusion is undoubtedly correct. Any far-sighted French political leader, for the sake of peace and the national interests of France, should also seriously consider this opinion. Now is the time for the French government to resist the influence of the North African colonialist clique and rein in its actions on the Algerian issue.

### 合理的忧虑

    合理的忧虑
    十六个亚洲和非洲国家驻联合国的代表在四月十六日联名写信给安全理事会，指控法国当局不但拒绝同阿尔及利亚人民的代表进行谈判以满足他们的合法要求，反而加紧使用武力来执行它的镇压政策。他们郑重指出：阿尔及利亚的局势是对和平和安全的威胁，而且侵犯了基本自决权和彰明昭著地违反了其他基本人权。十六个亚非国家的这封信，说出了一切爱好和平和正义的人们的意见。
    阿尔及利亚局势最近的发展不能不引起人们深切的忧虑。由于法国不愿意在阿尔及利亚采取像解决摩洛哥和突尼斯问题那样较为现实的态度，拒绝用谈判的办法来促成停火的实现，以便于和平地解决阿尔及利亚的问题，相反地不断增派军队，加强军事镇压措施，结果使得那里的武装冲突日益频繁和激烈，被屠杀的人日益增多，局势愈来愈紧张，也使得法国和一些阿拉伯国家的关系趋于恶化。如果让阿尔及利亚的局势继续恶化下去，那就将严重地危及地中海和北非地区的和平和安全，对整个缓和国际紧张局势的事业产生十分不利的影响。人们注意到某些国际势力正在企图利用地中海和北非地区的紧张局势进行挑衅和扩张的迹象，更有理由对这种局势感到忧虑。事态的这种发展，对于法国也决不会是有利的。
    亚洲和非洲各国人民一向非常关心阿尔及利亚的情势。去年在万隆举行的亚非会议曾经庄严地宣告支持阿尔及利亚人民争取自由和独立的事业，要求法国政府在承认阿尔及利亚人民自决和独立权利的基础上迅速促成阿尔及利亚问题的和平解决。十六亿人民的这种共同愿望和意志没有理由不受到法国政府的重视。由于亚非国家的努力，联合国第十届大会曾经决定把阿尔及利亚问题列入议程。后来亚非国家的代表同意在那一届会议上暂不讨论阿尔及利亚问题，而期望法国采取措施通过谈判方式来求得这个问题的圆满解决。但是令人遗憾的是亚非国家一致表示的这种愿望迄今没有得到法国当局应有的注意。
    法国总理摩勒最近一再强调说：“我们决不用武力强迫阿尔及利亚人民接受一种解决办法。我们决不允许用暴力来取得解决。”真正关心阿尔及利亚问题的和平解决的人都会欢迎这个意见。但是良好的表示如果不能以行动来支持就会失去它的意义。想靠兵力方面的压倒优势和残暴的屠杀来使要求独立的人民停止反抗殖民主义镇压的斗争，本身就是一种强权政治和殖民主义的表现，是同和平和承认民族自决权的准则背道而驰的。要求阿尔及利亚为独立而战的人民投降和接受法国在阿尔及利亚的军事统治作为开始和平谈判的先决条件，实际上只能排斥在平等和相互尊重的基础上来谈判恢复阿尔及利亚的和平和实现阿尔及利亚的民族自决。如果摩勒的话确实表达了法国关于和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的意愿，那末法国就显然不应该增派军队、加紧“扫荡”，而应该设法缓和那里的局势，创造一种和平的气氛，以为举行公平的谈判铺平道路。大家都看到，现在拒绝立即开始和平谈判并且提出了举行谈判的单方面条件的是法国而不是阿尔及利亚人民。这当然绝不可能为法国争取到舆论的同情。只有尊重阿尔及利亚人民的民族权利，并用和平谈判而不是军事镇压的方法来处理问题才能使问题得到解决，而这种解决也将符合于法国的利益和和平的利益。摩洛哥和突尼斯的前例已经有力地证明了这一点。硬要把阿尔及利亚的问题说成似乎同摩洛哥、突尼斯的问题不同是于事无补的。法国在阿尔及利亚加强军事措施的做法，在法国国内正遭到日益广泛的反对。这说明法国广大人民都清楚地看到了什么是解决阿尔及利亚问题的真正途径。不久以前法国争取和平解决北非问题全国委员会的一个代表团调查和研究了阿尔及利亚的局势之后作出了结论说：“法国的利益绝不在于进行一场新的殖民战争。只有同阿尔及利亚建立友好的、兄弟般的联系才能保持这些利益。……这就是一种自由同意的联合，互相尊重，处于绝对平等的地位。要作到这一点的前提是满足阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望。”这一结论无疑是正确的。任何有远见的法国政治领袖，为和平和法国的民族利益着想，也应该认真考虑这个意见。现在是法国政府抵挡北非殖民集团的影响，在阿尔及利亚问题上悬崖勒马的时候了。
