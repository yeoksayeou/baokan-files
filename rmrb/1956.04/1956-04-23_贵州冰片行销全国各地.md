    Guizhou Borneol Reaches Markets Throughout the Country

    Borneol produced in Luodian Buyi Autonomous County, Guizhou Province, has been tested by the state-owned Jiangxi Pharmaceutical Factory and found to have a purity of 99.9%, exceeding the quality of imported goods. It is currently selling well throughout the country.

    Borneol is an indispensable raw material in pharmaceutical production. In the past, because China's own production of borneol was insufficient, it had to be purchased from abroad every year. Since the first quarter of last year, the Luodian Nationalities Trading Company has been using the locally abundant Artemisia powder to process and manufacture borneol, and the price of its products is only one-fifth to one-quarter of that of imported goods.

    In order to expand borneol production, relevant departments are preparing to establish a local state-owned Luodian Borneol Factory. In late March, the Luodian Nationalities Trading Company also signed Artemisia powder purchase contracts with agricultural production cooperatives in Artemisia powder producing areas.

    贵州冰片行销全国各地
    贵州省罗甸布依族自治县生产的冰片，经过国营江西制药厂鉴定，纯度达到99.9％，超过进口货质量，目前已经畅销全国各地。
    冰片是制药中不可缺少的原料。过去因为我国生产的冰片不够应用，每年都要向国外购买。罗甸民族贸易公司从去年第一季度起利用当地大量出产的艾粉，加工制造冰片，产品价格只等于进口货的五分之一到四分之一。
    为了扩大冰片生产，有关部门正在筹备建立地方国营罗甸冰片制造厂。罗甸民族贸易公司也在三月下旬普遍同艾粉产地的农业生产合作社订立了艾粉收购合同。
