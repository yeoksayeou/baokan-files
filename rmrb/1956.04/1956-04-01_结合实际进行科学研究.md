Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

　　Of the more than 400 teachers at Renmin University of China who are participating in scientific research this year, more than 200 have submitted research plans, and some of them have already gone to factories and rural areas to conduct investigations. The theses written by teachers Fan Dejiang, Xu Yifen, and Shen Zhiqi of the Political Economics Teaching and Research Office, based on their investigation materials from a joint state-private enterprise in Tianjin, on the production plans of joint state-private enterprises and how to transform capitalists during joint operation, have a certain practical significance. The thesis written by lecturer Shen Liang'an of the Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning Teaching and Research Office after his investigation in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Tianjin Steel Plant, put forward the argument that the level of piecework output quotas should be consistent with the state production plan targets, which has received attention from the industrial sector.

    结合实际进行科学研究
    中国人民大学今年参加科学研究的四百多个教师中，已有二百多个教师提出了调查研究计划，其中一部分教师已到工厂、农村进行调查。政治经济学教研室教师范德江、徐亦芬和沈志求，根据他们在天津一个公私合营企业调查的材料写的关于公私合营企业生产计划和在合营中如何改造资本家问题的论文，有一定的现实意义。工业企业组织与计划教研室讲师沈亮安在石景山钢铁厂和天津钢厂调查后写的论文，提出了计件产量定额水平应该和国家生产计划指标保持一致的论点，受到产业部门的重视。
