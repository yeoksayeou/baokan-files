Hubei News in Brief

　　In Hubei Province, Xiaogan, Hanyang, Yingcheng and other counties have organized local iron, woodworking, and handicraft production cooperatives to go to the countryside to repair farm tools for agricultural production cooperatives and farmers. In Xiaogan County, the four service teams of the iron and woodworking production cooperative helped farmers repair 110 waterwheels in Luo Bei and other townships; they also signed contracts with some local agricultural production cooperatives to manufacture 241 large and small farm tools.

　　In order to overcome the shortage of electric welding and oxygen cutting workers, each work shift of the Electromechanical Squad of the Second Bridge Team of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau launched a variety of technical learning campaigns in January this year. Now, all 28 workers in the electric welding class have mastered two technologies. In the past, two workers were needed to be on duty on a bridge pier to be responsible for electric welding, oxygen cutting and other work. Now, only one worker on duty can complete the task.

　　Hubei Provincial Grain Factory recently transferred more than 30 million jin of high-quality japonica rice seeds from Liaoning, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and other places. After technical appraisal, the germination rate of this batch of seeds generally reaches more than 80%. Now most of these seeds have been supplied to the masses. The masses are now selecting seeds, soaking seeds, and dressing seeds with pesticides.
