    Numbers on Paper
    In some areas of Gansu Province, a tendency to blindly pursue numbers has emerged in the work of mobilizing farmers to dig wells. In Chenjiamo Village, Pengbao Township, Guyuan County, there was a place where lake water could be drawn to irrigate the land, but the village workers made the farmers dig four “five-in-a-row wells” there. In Panjiaquan Village, forty wells were dug on fifty mu of land. In Longde County, Pingliang Prefecture, seventy well openings were also dug in places where canals were about to pass. In some places, as many as half of the wells that were dug were dry wells.
    After discovering this situation, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China inspected the well-digging work, and in the process of inspection, educated cadres and the masses to realize that water conservancy construction is for irrigation and for increasing production, not for completing "numbers" on paper.

    纸上的数字
    甘肃省有些地方在发动农民打井的工作中，发生了盲目追求数字的偏向。固原县彭堡乡陈家磨村有个地方可以引湖滩水浇地，这个村的工作人员却让农民在那里打了四个“五连眼井”。潘家泉村在五十亩地里打了四十眼井。平凉专区隆德县在水渠将要经过的地方也打了七十个井口。有些地方打好的井，竟有一半是空井。
    中共甘肃省委在发现这一种情况以后，对打井工作进行了检查，并在检查过程中教育干部和群众认识到兴修水利是为了灌溉，为了增产，不是为了完成纸上的“数字”。
