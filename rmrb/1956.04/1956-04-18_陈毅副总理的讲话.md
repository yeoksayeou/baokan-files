The Central Government and Chairman Mao are satisfied with the achievements made in the Tibet region in recent years in terms of unity with all ethnic groups in the motherland and internal unity in Tibet, as well as in various tasks.

Here, I wish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which is about to be established, a successful completion of its mission, and on behalf of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, Chairman Liu, and Premier Zhou, I would like to express my gratitude and condolences to the people of all strata in Tibet and the leaders of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, to the Tibet Work Committee of the Communist Party of China, and to the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet and local troops. We firmly believe that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibet region will achieve even more brilliant achievements on the basis of its existing work results.
