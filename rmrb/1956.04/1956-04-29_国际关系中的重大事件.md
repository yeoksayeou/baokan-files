    Major Events in International Relations

    At the invitation of the British government, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Nikolai Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Nikita Khrushchev, visited Britain from April 18 to April 27. This visit was highly valued by people all over the world. Peace-loving people around the world have warmly hoped that the contact between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and Britain will not only improve Soviet-British relations but will also help promote the further relaxation of the international situation, enhance trust and cooperation between major powers, and pave the way for the establishment of sound international relations. Now, the enormous international significance of this visit has been proven.

    The visit to Britain by the leaders of the Soviet government itself demonstrates the current trend in the international situation. Due to the West's long-term "Cold War" policy, personal contact between the heads of government of countries with different social systems had been suspended for a long time in the decade after the war. This situation greatly hindered the establishment of international trust and cooperation, the resolution of major international issues, and the relaxation of international tensions. After the Geneva Four-Power Summit, under the influence and impetus of the "Geneva spirit," and with the increasing calls from people around the world for peaceful coexistence, visits and contacts between heads of government have greatly increased. The visit to Britain by the leaders of the Soviet government is one of the most significant international events since the Geneva Conference. This visit proves the bankruptcy of those who attempt to undermine the "Geneva spirit" and will inevitably contribute to the consolidation and development of the "Geneva spirit."

    The visit of the Soviet government leaders to Britain received a warm and friendly welcome from the British people. This reflects the sincere desire of the British people to improve Soviet-British relations and safeguard world peace. The statement and joint declaration on the talks issued by the two heads of government were immediately warmly welcomed by the people of Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries, and were considered by British public opinion as a "stepping stone to world security."

    There is reason for British public opinion to evaluate the results of the Soviet-British talks in this way. As can be seen from the statement of the talks, the talks between the heads of the two governments were conducted in a friendly and frank atmosphere and in a spirit of realism. This is the concrete manifestation of the "Geneva spirit." The Soviet Union and Britain are two major powers with different social systems. They can both have a significant impact on the development of the international situation; they both bear a major responsibility for safeguarding world peace. Strengthening mutual trust between these two major powers will certainly promote the entire situation in a direction favorable to peace. The two countries affirmed in the statement of the talks that the contact between national leaders has had a positive result in strengthening international trust, which proves that the meeting has made significant gains in increasing mutual trust between the Soviet Union and Britain. At the same time, the two countries also affirmed that the basis for friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence is respect for national independence and sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. They also expressed their willingness to make their best efforts to end the arms race around the world. The agreement of the two governments on these principled issues will undoubtedly have a major impact on easing international tensions.

    The results of the Soviet-British summit will first have a beneficial impact on easing the situation in the Near East and the Middle East and will provide a strong restraint on attempts to intervene militarily in the people of the Near East. The two governments agreed to take measures in accordance with the national aspirations of the people of the countries concerned, the need to ensure their independence, and fully in accordance with the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter, to seek peace in the Palestine region. If the countries concerned can treat the problems of the Near East and the Middle East in this spirit, then the situation in the Near East and the Middle East can be stabilized.

    On the issue of disarmament, the heads of government of the two countries announced that their common goal is the final prohibition of nuclear weapons and agreed that practical measures should be taken immediately and unconditionally to substantially reduce the armed forces of all countries under appropriate international supervision, starting with the reduction of the five major powers. This will obviously help promote an early solution to the disarmament issue.

    The Soviet-British talks discussed the issue of developing trade between the two countries. Since the Geneva Four-Power Summit, economic and cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and Britain have developed. The list of British goods worth 800 million to 1 billion pounds that the Soviet Union proposed to purchase from Britain during the talks demonstrates the extremely great potential for expanding trade between the two countries. As Khrushchev pointed out in his speech during his visit to Birmingham, trade is a foundation for laying friendly relations. The expansion of Soviet-British trade will have a positive impact on the further strengthening of relations between the two countries. The only obstacle to the current expansion of Soviet-British trade is the so-called "embargo" imposed on various countries by the United States. Obviously, further development of Soviet-British trade relations still requires efforts from both the Soviet Union and Britain, especially Britain.

    The Soviet-British talks reached a number of agreements on further developing cultural, scientific, and technological ties between the two countries. The specific implementation of these agreements will promote cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain, strengthen mutual understanding between the peoples of the two countries, and improve relations between the two countries. These agreements also set an example for the development of cultural and scientific ties and exchanges between countries with different social systems, which will have a positive impetus for enhancing friendly cooperation and understanding among the peoples of all countries.

    The Soviet-British talks once again proved that personal contact between heads of government helps to improve international relations and resolve international issues. Similarly, the Soviet-British talks once again proved that as long as there is a sincere desire for peaceful coexistence, countries with different social systems can find a common language and resolve problems through consultation. Therefore, the Soviet-British talks will have a profound impact on promoting international consultation.

    The achievements of the Soviet-British talks not only mark a major development in Soviet-British relations but also mark a major event in the development of the international situation in a direction favorable to peace since the Geneva Four-Power Summit. This is another major achievement of Soviet peaceful diplomacy. The Chinese people, like peace-loving people all over the world, warmly welcome the positive results achieved in the talks.

    Of course, it is impossible and unrealistic to solve all the problems between the Soviet Union and Britain through one meeting. The statement of the Soviet-British talks frankly announced that the two countries did not reach an understanding on the method of achieving European security and on some other issues. At the same time, during the visit of the Soviet government leaders to Britain, some forces in Britain who feared the improvement of Soviet-British relations attempted to obstruct the role that this visit could play, and some other reactionary public opinions also wanted to belittle the significance of the results of the Soviet-British talks. Judging from these situations, difficulties and obstacles still exist. In order to further resolve other outstanding international issues, in order to ensure that the various issues on which a consensus was reached during the Soviet-British talks are resolved and that the agreements reached can be realized, the governments of the Soviet Union and Britain and the people of all countries must make long-term and serious efforts.

    As the saying goes, the first step is always the hardest. The development of Soviet-British relations has now had a good start, which is a major development in the shift from tension to relaxation in post-war international relations. We believe that as long as the people of all countries persist in their efforts to improve international relations and ease the international situation, no force can stop the situation from continuing to move in a direction favorable to peace.

### 国际关系中的重大事件

    国际关系中的重大事件
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫应英国政府的邀请，从四月十八日到二十七日访问了英国。这次访问受到了各国人民的十分重视。全世界爱好和平的人民热烈地期望苏英两国政府首脑之间的接触，不但将使苏英关系得到改进，并且将有助于促进国际局势的进一步和缓，增强大国之间的信任和合作，为建立良好的国际关系开辟道路。现在，这次访问的巨大的国际意义已经得到了证明。
    苏联政府领袖访问英国，这个事实本身就说明了目前国际局势的趋向。由于西方长期的“冷战”政策，在战后十年之中，不同社会制度的国家政府领袖之间的个人接触曾经长期陷于停顿。这种情况大大阻碍了国际间信任和合作的建立，阻碍了重大国际问题的解决和国际紧张局势的和缓。在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以后，在“日内瓦精神”的影响和推动之下，随着各国人民要求和平共处的呼声的增长，各国政府首脑之间的访问和接触大大增加了。苏联政府领袖访问英国是日内瓦会议以后所发生的最重大的国际事件之一。这次访问证明了那些妄想破坏“日内瓦精神”的人的破产，并且必然有助于“日内瓦精神”的巩固和发展。
    苏联政府领袖对英国的访问受到了英国人民的热情友好的欢迎。这反映了英国人民对于改善苏英关系和维护世界和平的真诚愿望。两国政府领袖发表的关于会谈的声明和联合宣言立即得到了英国、苏联和各国人民的热烈欢迎，并且被英国舆论认为是“走向世界安全的踏脚石”。
    苏英会谈的结果得到英国舆论这样的评价是有理由的。从会谈声明中可以看出，两国政府领袖之间的会谈是在友好而坦率的气氛中、本着现实主义的精神进行的。这正是“日内瓦精神”的具体表现。苏联和英国是社会制度不同的两个大国。它们对于国际局势的发展都能够发生重大影响；对于维护世界和平都负有重大的责任。加强这两个大国之间的相互信任，就一定能够推动整个局势向有利于和平的方向前进。两国在会谈声明中肯定国家领导人的接触已经对加强国际信任产生了积极的结果，这证明会议在增进苏英两国的相互信任方面已经有了显著的收获。同时，两国还确认友好合作和和平共处的基础是尊重国家的独立和主权、领土完整和不干涉其他国家的内政。他们并且表示愿意尽最大力量结束全世界的军备竞赛。两国政府在这些原则性的问题上的意见一致，无疑将对和缓国际紧张局势发生重大的作用。
    苏英两国政府首脑会谈的结果首先将对和缓近东和中东的局势发生有利的影响，并对武装干涉中近东人民的企图给以有力的约束。两国政府一致同意根据有关国家人民的民族愿望、根据保证它们独立的必要性、并且完全按照联合国宪章所提出的原则来采取措施，来谋求巴勒斯坦地区的和平。如果有关国家都能以这样的精神来对待中近东问题，那末中近东的局势就可以获得稳定。
    在裁军问题上，两国政府首脑宣布他们的共同目标是最后的禁止核子武器，并且一致同意应当无条件地立即开始在适当的国际监督下对各国武装部队采取大量裁减的实际措施，并且以五大国的裁减作为开始。这显然将有助于促进裁军问题的及早解决。
    苏英会谈讨论了发展两国之间贸易的问题。从日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以来，苏英两国之间的经济和文化交流已经有了发展。苏联在会谈中向英国提出的购买价值八亿到十亿英镑英国货物的货单，展示了两国之间扩大贸易的极为巨大的可能性。正如赫鲁晓夫在访问伯明翰时发表的演说中所指出的，在奠定友好关系方面，贸易是一个基础。苏英贸易的扩大，将对两国关系的进一步加强产生积极的影响。目前苏英贸易扩大的唯一阻碍，就是美国所强加于各国的所谓“禁运”。显然，苏英的贸易关系的更进一步的发展，还有待于苏英两国、特别是英国方面的努力。
    苏英会谈在进一步发展两国之间的文化、科学和技术的联系方面达成了若干协议。这些协议的具体执行，将会促进苏英之间在文化上和科学、技术上的交流和合作，加强两国人民之间的相互了解和改善两国的关系。这些协议也为不同社会制度国家之间发展文化和科学方面的联系和交流作出了榜样，这对于增进各国人民之间的友好合作和谅解将有积极的推动作用。
    苏英会谈再一次证明了：各国政府首脑之间的个人接触有助于国际关系的改善和国际问题的解决。同样，苏英会谈也再一次证明了：只要具有和平共处的真诚愿望，不同社会制度国家之间就能够找到共同的语言，通过协商来解决问题。因此，苏英会谈对于促进国际协商将产生深远的影响。
    苏英会谈的成就不仅标志着苏英两国关系的重大发展，而且也是标志着日内瓦四国首脑会议以后国际局势向着有利于和平方向发展的重大事件。这是苏联和平外交政策的又一个重大的成就。中国人民也和全世界爱好和平的人民一样，对会谈所取得的积极结果表示热烈的欢迎。
    当然，要想通过一次会谈解决苏英之间的一切问题是不可能的，也是不现实的。苏英会谈的声明坦率地宣布，两国在实现欧洲安全的方法问题和其他一些问题的方面，没有取得谅解。同时，在苏联政府领袖访问英国期间，英国国内一部分害怕苏英关系改善的势力曾经企图阻挠这种访问所能发生的作用，另外一些反动舆论还想贬低苏英会谈的结果的意义。从这些情况看，困难和阻碍仍然存在。为了进而解决其他悬而未决的国际问题，为了使苏英会谈中取得一致结论的各项问题得到解决和达成的协议能够实现，苏英两国政府和世界各国人民还必须作长期认真的努力。
    俗语说，万事起头难。苏英关系的发展现在已经有了良好的开端，这是战后国际关系从紧张转向缓和的一次重大发展。我们相信，只要各国人民坚持为改善国际关系、和缓国际局势而努力，任何势力也阻挡不住局势向着有利于和平的方向继续前进。
