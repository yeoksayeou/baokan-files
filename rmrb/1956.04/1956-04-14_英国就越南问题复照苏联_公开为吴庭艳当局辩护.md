Xinhua News Agency, London, 13th. The British Foreign Office announced on the evening of the 10th the British government's note to the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue. In this note, the British government openly defended the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities' acts of sabotaging the Geneva Accords and attempted to help the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities evade their inescapable responsibility for the Geneva Agreement.

This note from the British government is a reply to the Soviet government's note of March 30th. In the note, the British government expressed its "disagreement" with the Soviet Union's accusation that the South Vietnamese authorities openly violated the military clauses of the Geneva Accords, and stated that it "cannot believe the accusation about (South Vietnam) preparing 'so-called military cadres for a northward advance in order to launch a new war in Indochina.'" The British government, reversing black and white, described the fact that South Vietnam, with the support of the United States, is stepping up its arms expansion as "reduction," and slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for carrying out "large-scale military expansion." Everyone knows that the claim about the "large-scale military expansion" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has long been proven unfounded by the International Commission.

The British government stated in the note that it believes "it is extremely important to maintain peace between North and South Vietnam at present." The note acknowledges that free elections throughout Vietnam must be held in accordance with the provisions of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, and expresses regret over the fact that Vietnam "has not made great progress in the implementation of the political clauses"; however, on the other hand, the note repeats Ngo Dinh Diem's tune, stating that the British government "does not consider the government of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) legally obliged to adopt this approach."

Although the British government expressed its hope in the note that Vietnam would eventually be unified, the British note is essentially encouraging the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities to continue to refuse to fulfill the political clauses of the Geneva Agreement, causing Vietnam to fall into long-term division. The British government's position is incompatible with its status as one of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference.

### 英国就越南问题复照苏联  公开为吴庭艳当局辩护

    英国就越南问题复照苏联
    公开为吴庭艳当局辩护
    新华社13日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部在十日晚上公布了英国政府就越南问题给苏联的照会。英国政府在这个照会中公然为吴庭艳当局的破坏日内瓦协议的行为辩护，并且企图帮助吴庭艳当局推卸它对日内瓦协定所负的不能逃避的责任。
    英国政府的这个照会是对苏联政府三月三十日的照会的答复。英国政府在照会中表示“不同意”苏联对南越当局公开违反日内瓦协定的军事条款的指责，并且表示“丝毫不能相信关于（南越）准备‘所谓北进的军事干部，以在印度支那发动新战争’的指责”。英国政府颠倒黑白地把南越在美国支持下正在加紧扩军的事实说成是“裁减”，并且诬蔑越南民主共和国进行“大规模的军事扩张”。大家知道，关于越南民主共和国“大规模军事扩张”的说法，早已被国际委员会证明是没有根据的。
    英国政府在照会中表示认为“目前保持越南北方和南方之间的和平是极其重要的”。照会承认必须按照日内瓦会议最后宣言的规定举行全越南的自由选举，并且对越南“在实现政治条款方面没有很大的进展”的情况表示遗憾；但是另一方面，照会又重复吴庭艳的论调，表示英国政府“并不认为越南共和国（南越）政府在法律上有义务采取这种方针”。
    尽管英国政府在照会中表示希望越南能最后得到统一，但是英国的照会实质上是鼓励吴庭艳当局继续拒绝履行日内瓦协议的政治条款，使越南陷于长期的分裂。英国政府的这种立场是和它的作为日内瓦会议的两位主席之一的身份不相称的。
