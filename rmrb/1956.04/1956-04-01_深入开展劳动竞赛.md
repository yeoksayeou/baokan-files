    Deepen the Labor Competition
    To the Editor:
    All the employees of our Tianjin Vehicle Spring Factory have actively participated in the socialist labor competition and have already achieved great results. The spring workshop has changed the situation where most products could not meet the quota in the past. In February, 63 pieces of products met the quota. The Men Xirong group in the heat treatment workshop learned from advanced Soviet experience and adopted the flow-line operation method in production. On March 2nd, the output of spring increased by 70% compared with before.
    Many employees have actively put forward rationalization proposals in the labor competition. Currently, 51 suggestions have been adopted. Zheng Ruzhi, the leader of the smothering kiln group in the sand molding workshop, put forward a rationalization proposal that reduced the smothering time from 24 hours to 12 hours per kiln. Zhang Engui, a fitter in the machine fitting workshop, who had not performed well in the past, also actively participated in the labor competition and improved the tool for the sleeper berth insert, which doubled the daily output.
    At present, all the employees in the factory are working harder to achieve greater results in production.

    深入开展劳动竞赛编辑同志：
    我们天津车辆弹簧厂的全体职工积极地投入了社会主义的劳动竞赛，现在已经取得了很大成绩。元簧车间改变了过去大部分产品不能完成定额的状况，二月份完成定额的产品就有63件。热处理车间门喜荣小组学习了苏联先进经验，在生产中采用了流水作业法，三月二日元簧产量比以前提高了70％。
    许多职工在劳动竞赛中积极提出了合理化建议。目前已经采纳的建议就有51件。翻沙车间焖火窑组组长郑汝芝提出的合理化建议，使焖火时间由二十四小时降低到十二小时一炉。机配车间钳工张恩贵过去工作中表现不好，这次也积极参加了劳动竞赛，并且改进了卧铺托插方的工具，使日产量提高了一倍。
    目前，全厂的职工们正在进一步努力，争取在生产中取得更大的成绩。
