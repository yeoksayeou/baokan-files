    Telegram of Congratulations from the CPC Central Committee to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany

    To the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany:

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends to you warm and fraternal congratulations!

    For the past ten years, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has led the working class and working people of Germany in implementing a series of democratic social reforms, successfully completing the first Five-Year Plan, further improving the material and cultural living standards of the people of the German Democratic Republic, and laying a solid foundation for the cause of socialist construction. At the same time, it has also led the German people in unremitting struggle for the peaceful reunification of Germany and the guarantee of European collective security.

    We wish the Socialist Unity Party of Germany greater achievements in leading the German people in the just cause of striving for the reunification, peace, and democracy of their motherland, and in the effort to continuously improve the material and cultural lives of the working people. We wish the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German peoples will be increasingly consolidated and developed in the common struggle to defend world peace.

      The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
      April 18, 1956
