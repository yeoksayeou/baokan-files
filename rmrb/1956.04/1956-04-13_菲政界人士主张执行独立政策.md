Xinhua News Agency, Manila, April 12th: Manila Mayor Arsenio Lacson stated in a nationwide broadcast on the evening of April 11th that he advocates for the Philippines to engage in trade with China and the Soviet Union. He also demanded that if the United States insists on continuing its current policies in the Philippines, the existing military and trade agreements with the United States should be abolished.

Lacson believes that both China and the Soviet Union have the potential to purchase Philippine products. He also said that while some of America's allies, such as Britain and Japan, are doing business with communist countries, the twenty million Filipinos cannot afford to oppose trade with communists.

Lacson said that the United States should remove the unfair clauses in the various agreements between the Philippines and the United States. He said, "Let no American fantasize that our economy can only be saved by the United States."

Philippine Congressman Joaquin Roces said in a public speech to the Tarlac province sugarcane association on April 2nd: "As everyone knows, the new conditions attached to U.S. foreign aid are harder than iron."

Roces urged Filipinos not to forget that, in the end, they must rely on their own efforts.

    菲政界人士主张执行独立政策
    据新华社12日讯　马尼拉消息：马尼拉市长阿塞尼奥·拉克森四月十一日晚在对全国的广播中说，他主张菲律宾同中国和苏联进行贸易，并且要求，如果美国坚持在菲律宾继续采取现行政策的话，就废除同美国之间现有的军事和贸易协定。
    拉克森认为中国和苏联都有可能购买菲律宾的物产，他还说，在英国和日本这样一些美国的盟国也在同共产党国家做生意的时候，两千万菲律宾人是经不起反对同共产党进行贸易的。
    拉克森说，美国应该取消菲律宾和美国之间的各种协定中的不正当的条款。他说：“不要让任何美国人再幻想我国的经济要靠美国才能得救。”
    菲律宾众议员豪金·罗赛斯四月二日在丹辘省甘未会的一次公开演讲中说：“大家知道，美国对外援助所附的新式的条件比铁还要坚硬。”
    罗赛斯敦促菲律宾人不要忘记，到头来他们必须自力更生。
