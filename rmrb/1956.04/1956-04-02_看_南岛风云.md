    Watching "Storm Over the Southern Islands"
    Liu Zhongping
    Screenwriter: Li Yingmin　Director: Bai Chen　Produced by Shanghai Film Studio
      "Storm Over the Southern Islands" belongs to the category of some good films recently released, and the achievements of these films cannot but make us happy for the growth of our country's film art.
      "Storm Over the Southern Islands" depicts the story of a wounded soldiers' unit of a people's guerrilla force on Hainan Island during the Anti-Japanese War, persisting in their struggle in the deep mountains. Eighteen wounded soldiers, hidden in the mountains after the main force transferred, had their connection with the masses severed and were trapped by the enemy. They had no food, no medicine, and they could not break through the encirclement because those wounded soldiers
  "couldn't even walk five *li* if they didn't encounter the Japanese." They had to persevere here, persevere until victory, persevere until the main force returned. There is no breathtaking struggle here, but this perseverance itself is a great heroism. To persevere, one needs unparalleled strength. The film infectiously shows us this strength. This strength, after being tested by fire, does not turn into ashes, but becomes steel.
    We see this strength concretely from the main character depicted in the film, head nurse Fu Ruohua, and from the characters of the old clerk, the instructor, Zhang Qiang, Xiao Yang, and so on. Moreover, from the relationships between these people with different experiences, consciousness, and personalities, from their mutual support, contradictions, and the struggle against the traitors, we see how the strength in these people is improved under the influence of the Party's ideology, how they grow up in the face of severe tests, and how they combine to become a stronger collective. The film convincingly shows that this strength finally guides the people to persevere until victory.
    The film successfully portrays the brilliant image of Fu Ruohua, a strong female soldier, from the development of the struggle. She initially appears before the audience as just an ordinary head nurse. She has never left the main force and has never shouldered such a major responsibility: the fate of eighteen wounded soldiers is entrusted to her. From her depressed expression in those early days, we see her heaviness and anxiety. But from the optimistic tone of the old clerk, from the instructor's cuckoo call imitated on the harmonica, and from Xiao Yang's singing, we also feel the strength of this collective and the support and encouragement that this collective gives to the head nurse. In the film's depiction of the difficult early days that this wounded soldiers' unit spent after leaving the main force, there is an extremely touching scene: the old clerk goes down the mountain to get food, but almost falls into the hands of the Japanese. Their connection with the masses is discovered by the enemy and severed. When the head nurse has to tell the serious situation to the wounded soldiers who are waiting for the clerk to bring back food, the answer she hears is the majestic song led by Xiao Yang:
    …The spring breeze blows across the flat plains,
    The mountains form a solid screen.
    Ah! Yan'an, your solemn and majestic ancient city,
    Everywhere spreads the song of resistance…
    This song is so moving that it moistens our eyes along with those of the head nurse. This song connects this small collective with a great collective. Eighteen wounded soldiers are besieged in the deep mountains, but they are not alone. Behind them stands the revolutionary holy land—Yan'an. This is the lighthouse in their hearts. Guided by this lighthouse, they will overcome any dangerous night and greet the dawn of victory.
    However, the test is, after all, cruel: food runs out, medicine is exhausted, and the old clerk, whom the head nurse relies on as her main assistant, finally sacrifices himself. We see how she runs to the empty shack of the clerk in the storm, sobbing while hugging the pillar, and we also hear the sentence she tremblingly utters to the instructor: "I'm really scared!" Yes, "In everyone's soul, there is strength and weakness, courage and fear, firmness and wavering, purity and baseness." In a severe test, "what can exist is either this or that, either this or that" (Julius Fucik's words). We see that, after struggle and testing, what remains in the head nurse's soul is the former of all these. She has grown up. As if the dead old clerk has passed on his strength to her, she alone firmly shoulders the burden that was previously shared by two people. When we see her persuading Zhang Qiang and others of the idea of blindly trying to fight desperately in the more difficult days that follow, we no longer see the depressed expression that revealed weakness on her face, but rather a calm sternness. When she takes the gun from the instructor and shoots the traitor who cannot withstand the test and only has weakness, fear, wavering, and baseness left in his soul, we see the decisiveness of a leader. Is it necessary to hesitate about how to treat a traitor? What she should consider is how not to let the enemy know the truth about the situation on the mountain, the fate of the rest of the people. Thus, although we later experience such a great misfortune as the death of the instructor with her, we are no longer worried about her. From the scene of dealing with the spies sent up the mountain by the enemy and the scene of her determination to go down the mountain to contact the masses, we see her calmness and resourcefulness, as well as the wounded soldiers' trust and love for her. She, as the leader of this small wounded soldiers' unit, has matured.
    The film depicts the character of the head nurse from many aspects from the development of the struggle, depicting her growth, through such plots. This character is not a simple embodiment of some concept, but a real, flesh-and-blood person. Her thoughts and feelings are intimately connected to our feelings. We share her joys and sorrows. She takes us through those severe tests, moves us with her example, and also elevates us.
    In its plot development, the film also vividly portrays the images of other characters. For example, the optimistic and cheerful old clerk, the instructor who is seriously injured but still cares about the fate of all the wounded soldiers at all times, the innocent and naive Xiao Yang, the irritable and impatient Zhang Qiang who also faithfully wants to help the collective, and Yun Dalu, who initially hesitated and wavered in the face of difficulties, but later resolutely stopped the traitor from escaping. These characters all have their own characteristic faces, leaving us with unforgettable impressions.
    From the relationships between these characters, the film also movingly writes about the class friendship in the revolutionary ranks and the flesh-and-blood connection between the people's guerrillas and the masses. The scene where the instructor, lying on the sickbed, divides a bowl of thin porridge to the old clerk who is going down the mountain to get food and the head nurse who is already faint from hunger, and the scene where Uncle A Jin, who actively tries to transport food for the wounded soldiers, is arrested and faces the execution bravely and unyieldingly, are also unforgettable.
    The smoke of gunpowder on Hainan Island more than ten years ago has long since dissipated, but the heroic deeds cannot be erased. The heroic qualities of those people who grew up in the hard struggle have excited the playwright for a long time, and through the valuable labor of the author, director, and actors, the shining images of these ordinary people are reproduced before us again. These unforgettable images will also inspire and encourage us for a long time.

    看“南岛风云”
    刘仲平
    编　剧：李英敏　导演：白　沉　上海电影制片厂摄制
      “南岛风云”属于最近上演的一些好影片之列，这些影片的成就使我们不能不为我国电影艺术的成长感到高兴。
      “南岛风云”描写的是抗日战争中海南岛上一支人民游击队的伤员队伍，在深山里坚持斗争的故事。十八名伤员，在大队转移之后被隐蔽在山上，他们同群众的联系被割断了，陷于敌人的围困中，无粮，无药，而他们又无法突围，因为那些伤员
  “就是不碰上鬼子也跑不出五里路”去，他们必须在这里坚持，坚持到胜利，坚持到大队回来。这里面没有什么惊心动魄的斗争，然而这坚持本身就是一种伟大的英雄主义，要坚持下去就需要有无比的力量。影片富有感染力地向我们展示了这个力量，这力量经过火的考验，不是化为灰烬，而是变成了钢铁。
    我们从影片所描写的主要人物护士长符若华的身上，从老事务长、指导员、张强、小杨等等人物身上，具体地看到了这个力量。而且我们从这些具有不同经历、觉悟，具有不同性格的人物的相互关系中，从他们的相互支持，矛盾以及对待叛变者的斗争中，看到了这些人们身上的力量怎样在党的思想影响下得到提高，怎样在严峻的考验中成长起来，而结合成为一个更坚强的集体。影片令人信服地看到，这个力量终于引导人们坚持到了胜利。
    影片成功地从斗争的发展中描写了符若华这样一个坚强的女战士的光辉形象。她最初出现在观众面前，只是一个普通的护士长，她从来没有离开过大队，没有担负过这样重大的责任：十八个伤员的命运信托在她的手里。从最初那些日子里她的抑郁神情上，我们看到了她的沉重和焦虑。但是从老事务长的乐观的语调里，从指导员用口琴模仿的布谷鸟的叫声里，从小杨的歌声里，我们也感到了这个集体的力量，以及这集体的力量给予护士长的支持和鼓励。影片关于这支伤员队伍离开大队后所度过的最初那些困难日子的描写中，有一个场面是极为动人的：老事务长到山下去取粮食，结果几乎落进鬼子的手里，他们同群众的联系被敌人发觉了，而且被割断了。当护士长不得不把这个严重的情况告诉给那些正在盼望事务长带粮食回来的伤员们的时候，她听到的回答是小杨带头唱起的雄壮的歌声：
    ……春风吹遍了坦平的原野，
    群山结成了坚固的围屏。
    啊！延安，你这庄严雄伟的古城，
    到处传遍了抗战的歌声……
    这歌声是这样使我们激动，以至使我们同护士长一道被泪花润湿了眼睛。这歌声，把他们这个小小的集体同一个伟大的集体联系起来了。十八名伤员被围困在深山里，但是他们并不孤单，他们的背后屹立着革命的圣地——延安，这是他们心头的灯塔，凭着这灯塔的指引，他们会战胜任何艰险的黑夜，去迎接胜利的黎明。
    然而考验毕竟是残酷的：粮绝，药尽，护士长依为主要助手的老事务长也终于牺牲了。我们看到她怎样在暴风雨中跑到事务长的空寮前面抱着柱子呜咽，我们也听到了她向指导员颤抖地叫出的那句话：“我真怕啊！”是的，“每个人的灵魂里都有力量和软弱，勇敢和恐惧，坚定和动摇，纯洁和卑污”，在严酷的考验里面，“能够存在的不是这个就是那个，非此即彼”（尤利乌斯·伏契克的话）。我们看到，经过斗争和考验，在护士长的灵魂里存留下来的是所有这些里面的前者。她成长起来了。仿佛死去的老事务长把力量传给了她，她一个人坚强地挑起了从前两个人分担的担子。当我们看到在以后的更艰难的日子里，她说服张强等人想要拚命盲干的想法的时候，我们从她的神色上已经看不到那种透露着软弱的抑郁，而看到的是冷静的严峻。当她从指导员手里取下枪，朝着那个经受不起考验，灵魂里只留下了软弱、恐惧、动摇和卑污的叛变者开枪的时候，我们看到了作为一个领导人的果断。难道应该怎样对待一个叛徒还需要犹疑吗？她应该考虑的是如何不让敌人知道山上的虚实，是其余的人的命运。这样，虽然以后我们又同她一起经受了指导员的死那样巨大的不幸，但是我们不再为她担心了。而从对付敌人派上山来的奸细那场戏和她决心下山去同群众取得联系的那场戏里，我们看到了她的沉着和机警，以及伤员们对她的信任和爱戴。她，作为这支小小的伤员队伍的领导人，成熟起来了。
    影片就是通过这样一些情节，从斗争的发展中多方面地描写了护士长这个人物，描写了她的成长的。这个人物不是某种概念的简单的化身，而是一个真正有血有肉的活生生的人。她的思想情感息息相关地通向我们的情感。我们同她一起分担了忧喜。她带我们一道经历了那些严峻的考验，用她的榜样感动了我们，也提高了我们。
    影片在它的情节发展中，也鲜明地描划了其他一些人物的形象。例如乐观爽朗的老事务长，身负重伤仍然时刻关怀着全部伤员命运的指导员，稚气天真的小杨，烦乱急躁但是却也忠实地想要对集体有所帮助的张强，开头在困难面前犹疑动摇，后来却果断地拦阻叛变者的逃跑的云大禄，这些人物都有着自己的带有特征的面貌，留给了我们难忘的印象。
    影片从这些人物的相互关系中，也动人地写出了革命队伍里的阶级友爱，人民游击队同群众的血肉联系。指导员躺在病床上把一碗薄粥分给要下山去取粮食的老事务长和已经饿得发晕的护士长的场面，积极设法为伤员们运送粮食的阿金叔被捕后凛然不屈地临刑的场面，也都是使人难忘的。
    十多年前海南岛上的硝烟，早已消散，但是英雄的事迹却不能磨灭。那些在艰苦斗争中成长起来的人们的英雄品质，长时期地激动了剧作者，而通过作者和导演、演员们的可贵的劳动，这些普通人们的光辉形象，又再现在我们面前。这些令人难忘的形象，也将长时期地给我们以激励和鼓舞。
