Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 16th. The plenipotentiary representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China, Burhan, and the plenipotentiary representative of the Government of the Republic of Egypt, Minister of Education Hussein, signed the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Cooperation Agreement in Cairo on the morning of April 15th. The agreement will take effect from the date of the exchange of instruments of ratification in Beijing.

The signing of this agreement is the result of friendly negotiations between the governments of China and Egypt to implement the spirit of the Asian-African Conference on cultural cooperation and to further develop the summary of talks on cultural cooperation between the two countries signed by the government representatives last year.

The Egyptian side present at the signing ceremony included Minister of State Guidance Radwan, Deputy Minister Youssef, and other senior officials from the Ministry of Education.

The Chinese side present included Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Deputy Head of the Cultural and Art Delegation Ma Yuhuai, Ma Hanbing, Chinese Commercial Representative to Egypt Li Yingji, and Deputy Commercial Representative Zhang Yue.

After the signing, the Egyptian plenipotentiary representative Hussein delivered a speech. On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Egypt and the Egyptian people, he welcomed this step to strengthen cultural cooperation between the people of China and Egypt. He said: As we sign this agreement to promote mutual understanding and closer ties between our two countries, I would like to point out that there is a long and solid relationship between us. I would also like to point out that we have great common ground since the dawn of human civilization. The agreement formally signed today consolidates the long-standing relationship between the peoples of Egypt and China.

Hussein then pointed out: In the present period, this agreement has another important significance: it shows the new relationship that has occurred between us since the Bandung Conference in 1955.

The Chinese plenipotentiary representative Burhan then delivered a speech. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, he extended warm congratulations to the Government and people of the Republic of Egypt. He said that since the beginning of history, there have only been peaceful and friendly exchanges between the people of China and Egypt, and there has never been war or hatred. The people of the two countries not only have similarities in their way of life but also share the same destiny, and have suffered from imperialist plunder and oppression. Therefore, it is entirely understandable that the people of China and Egypt show sympathy and give support to each other.

Burhan pointed out: Colonialists, in order to keep us in a state of poverty and backwardness forever, attempted to continue their oppression and enslavement, and tried every means to obstruct the friendly exchanges between the people of our two countries and undermine our economic and cultural exchanges. However, the people of Egypt and the people of China will overcome all difficulties, strengthen the close contact between our two governments and peoples, and consolidate the friendly cooperation in economic and cultural aspects between the two countries, because all of this is in the interests of our two peoples.

Burhan said: During the Asian-African Conference, due to the establishment of the principles of peaceful coexistence and the meeting of the Prime Ministers of our two countries, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Egypt have entered a new era. Since last year, the exchanges between our two governments and peoples have become more and more frequent. Our two governments have signed a summary of talks on cultural cooperation and a trade agreement. All of this is a joint effort made by our two governments and peoples to realize the spirit and declaration of the Asian-African Conference. This is of great significance for safeguarding peace in Asia and Africa and the world.

Burhan finally pointed out: Today's signing of the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Cooperation Agreement symbolizes another step forward in the friendly cooperative relations between the governments and peoples of the two countries. We firmly believe that after the signing of the Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the scope of cultural exchanges between the two countries will be expanded and become more frequent.

    中埃文化合作协定在开罗签字
    新华社开罗16日电　中华人民共和国政府全权代表鲍尔汉和埃及共和国政府全权代表、教育部长侯赛尼四月十五日上午在开罗签订了中国埃及文化合作协定。协定将从在北京交换批准书之日起生效。
    这个协定的签订是中埃两国政府为贯彻亚非会议关于文化合作的协议的精神，进一步发展两国政府代表在去年签订的关于两国文化合作的会谈纪要而进行的友好谈判的结果。
    埃及方面出席签字仪式的有国家指导部长拉德温、副部长优素福和教育部的其他高级官员。
    中国方面出席的有对外贸易部长叶季壮、文化艺术代表团副团长马玉槐、马寒冰，中国驻埃及商务代表李应吉和商务副代表张越。
    在签字后，埃及全权代表侯赛尼致词。他代表埃及共和国政府和埃及人民表示欢迎这个加强中埃两国人民之间的文化合作的步骤。他说：在我们签订这一项促进我们两国之间的相互了解和更加紧密的联系的协定的时候，我愿意指出，在我们中间，存在着悠久和巩固的关系。我还愿意指出，自从人类文明的黎明时代起，我们中间就有着伟大的共同点。今天正式签订的这项协定，巩固了埃中两国人民之间悠久的关系。
    侯赛尼接着指出：在现时期，这项协定具有另外一个重大意义：它表明了在1955年的万隆会议以后我们之间所发生的新的关系。
    中国全权代表鲍尔汉接着致词。他代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向埃及共和国政府和人民致以热烈的祝贺。他说，从历史开始起，中埃两国人民之间只有和平和友好的往来，从来没有发生过战争或产生过仇恨，两国人民不但在生活方式方面有相似的地方，而且有着同样的命运，都遭受过帝国主义的掠夺和压迫。因此，中埃两国人民相互表示同情和给予支持，这是完全可以理解的。
    鲍尔汉指出：殖民主义者为了使我们永远处于贫困和落后的状态，企图继续他们的压迫和奴役，曾经千方百计地阻挠我们两国人民间的友好往来，破坏我们的经济和文化交流。但是，埃及人民和中国人民必将克服一切困难，加强我们两国政府和人民的密切接触，巩固两国的经济和文化方面的友好合作，因为所有这一切都是符合我们两国人民的利益的。
    鲍尔汉说：在亚非会议期间，由于和平共处的原则的确立和我们两国总理的会晤，中国和埃及的友好合作关系已经进入了一个新的时代。自从去年以来，我们两国的政府和人民之间的往来已经变得越来越频繁了。我们两国政府签订了文化合作会谈纪要和贸易协定。所有这一切都是我们两国政府和人民为了实现亚非会议的精神和宣言所作的共同努力。这对于保卫亚洲和非洲地区以及全世界的和平事业具有伟大的意义。
    鲍尔汉最后指出：今天中埃两国文化合作协定的签订，象征着两国政府和人民之间的友好的合作关系又向前迈进了一步。我们坚决相信，在文化合作协定签订以后，两国之间的文化交流的范围将会扩大，并且日益频繁。
