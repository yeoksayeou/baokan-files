    New Cork Factory in Hefei Begins Production
    The newly built cork factory in Hefei, Anhui Province, has recently started production.
    The main products of this mechanized cork factory are cork bricks and cork paper. These products are used for insulation, soundproofing, insulation, and as filler.
    The Dabie Mountains in Anhui Province have a large number of cork oak trees, which are the raw materials for manufacturing cork products. However, in the past, the cork products used in China's industry relied on imports. After this factory starts production, it will be possible to use our own raw materials to produce cork products.

    合肥新建软木厂开始生产
    安徽省合肥市新建软木工厂，已经在最近投入生产。
    这座机械化软木厂生产的产品，主要是软木砖和软木纸。这些产品有隔热、隔音、绝缘和充作填料等用途。
    安徽省大别山区有大量栓皮栎，是制造软木产品的原料。但是过去我国工业上用的软木产品，要靠国外输入。这座工厂开始生产以后，就可以利用我国自己的原料生产软木产品了。（本报驻合肥记者）
