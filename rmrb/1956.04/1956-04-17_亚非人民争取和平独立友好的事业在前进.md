Indian National Congress Leader

Expresses Hope for Algerian People to Achieve Freedom

The President of the Indian National Congress, Debar, said in a letter to the press on April 14th that he expressed "deep concern" about the developments in Algeria. He said that these developments have resulted in a large-scale massacre of the Algerian people who are striving for national freedom.

Debar pointed out in the letter that it is unfortunate that the wise policies adopted by France towards Morocco and Tunisia have not yet been applied to Algeria. He said: "Continuing colonial control by force is detrimental to all parties concerned."

Singapore Demands Self-Government Within One Year

London News: A delegation led by Singapore's Chief Minister Marshall arrived in London on April 15th. This delegation will negotiate Singapore's political status with the British government. Its members include representatives from Singapore's ruling party and opposition parties.

Negotiations between Britain and Singapore will begin on April 23rd. According to Reuters, the Singapore delegation demands that Singapore achieve self-government within the Commonwealth by April 1st of next year. The content of this negotiation includes the definition of self-government within the Commonwealth and the date of implementation of internal self-government, among other issues.

In a radio address before leaving Singapore on April 13th, Marshall said that Singapore hopes to be independent within the Commonwealth. He also said that Singapore is willing to allow Commonwealth countries to continue using Singapore "as a defense base." He also said that Britain will be given the right to guide Singapore's foreign policy "in matters related to defense, but not in matters related to trade and commerce." Marshall said while passing through Calcutta on April 14th that Singapore will trade with China after independence.

Lee Kuan Yew, the leader of the People's Action Party of Singapore who is also a member of the negotiating delegation, told the cheering crowd before leaving Singapore that the People's Action Party advocates the complete independence of a unified Malaya composed of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. At present, his party agrees with the opinions of other parties and will strive for full internal self-government for Singapore. He said, "We should shorten the time for the British to control foreign defense and diplomatic relations as much as possible."

    纳赛尔是在开罗的军官俱乐部对新毕业的军事学校学生们讲话时说这些话的。最后一批英国陆军和空军部队撤出苏彝士运河区的消息已经在四月十四日宣布。

    印度国大党领袖
    希望阿尔及利亚人民获得自由
    印度国大党主席德巴四月十四日在对报界的信中说，他对阿尔及利亚局势的发展表示“深为关切”。他说，这种发展已经造成对阿尔及利亚争取民族自由的人民的大规模屠杀。
    德巴在信中指出，法国对摩洛哥和突尼斯所采取的明智政策至今还未适用于阿尔及利亚，这是很不幸的事。他说：“用武力来继续进行殖民控制，对有关双方都是不利的。”
    德巴说，他诚恳地希望阿尔及利亚人民将获得自由，并且对他们所遭受的悲惨的磨难表示完全的同情。
    新加坡要求一年内实现自治
    伦敦消息：以新加坡首席部长马歇尔为首的代表团在四月十五日到达伦敦。这个代表团将同英国政府谈判新加坡的政治地位。它的成员包括新加坡执政党和反对党的代表。
    英国同新加坡之间的谈判将在四月二十三日开始。据路透社报道，新加坡代表团要求在明年四月一日以前实现新加坡在英联邦内的自治。这次谈判的内容包括在英联邦内部自治的定义和实行内部自治的日期等问题。
    马歇尔在四月十三日离开新加坡以前发表的一篇广播演说中曾经说，新加坡希望在英联邦内独立。他同时又说，新加坡愿意让英联邦国家继续把新加坡“作为一个防御基地”使用。他还说，将给予英国在“有关防御，但不是有关贸易和商业方面”指导新加坡外交政策的权利。马歇尔在四月十四日路过加尔各答时曾经说，新加坡独立后将和中国进行贸易。
    参加谈判代表团的新加坡人民行动党领袖李光耀在离开新加坡以前曾向欢送的群众说，人民行动党主张由新加坡和马来亚联合邦组成的单一的马来亚的完全独立。在目前，他的党赞成其他政党的意见而将为新加坡争取充分的内部自治。他说，“对于由英国人掌握对外防务和外交关系的时间，我们应当尽可能予以缩短”。
