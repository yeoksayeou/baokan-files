The shaft of the People's Heroes Monument in the Tiananmen Square in the capital was completely finished on the 26th. The shaft, which is 25.37 meters high (including the top), is engraved with the eight golden characters "人民英雄永垂不朽" ("Eternal Glory to the People's Heroes") written by Chairman Mao on the front, and the inscription written by Premier Zhou and passed by the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, "为国牺牲的人民英雄纪念碑" ("Monument to the People's Heroes Who Sacrificed for the Country"), on the back. All the engraved characters are gilded, and each character reflects a dazzling golden light. The sides of the shaft are decorated with patterns of five-pointed stars, semi-circles of pine and cypress, and flags.

The gilding of the characters on the shaft was a very complex project, involving more than 20 procedures. The workers of the Beijing No. 1 Hardware Production Cooperative used magnifying glasses to check the quality of the gilded characters. If they found even a small flaw, they would try to repair it to ensure that the golden characters on the monument were completely qualified. The workers also summarized a set of systematic gilding technical operating procedures through this project.

At present, the workers are carrying out the concrete pouring of the base of the monument, and the installation of the stone material of the base will begin in May.

    人民英雄纪念碑碑身工程完工
    耸立在天安门前广场上的首都人民英雄纪念碑的碑身工程，在二十六日全部完工。这块高达二十五点三七公尺的碑身（包括碑顶）上，正面雕刻着毛主席题的“人民英雄永垂不朽”八个大字，背面刻着周总理写的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议所通过的“为国牺牲的人民英雄纪念碑”碑文。这些雕刻的字全部都是镏金的，每个字都反射出耀眼的金光。碑身侧面的雕刻装饰有五星、松柏半环和旗子的花纹。
    碑身的金字是一项很复杂的工程，前后经过的工序共有二十多道。北京市第一五金生产合作社的工人们，为了保证金字的质量，用放大镜进行检查，发现有一点毛病，都要设法修补，使得碑上的金字完全合格。工人们也通过这项工程总结出一套系统的镏金技术操作规程。
    目前，工人们正在进行浇灌碑座的混凝土工程，五月份开始安装碑座的石料工程。
