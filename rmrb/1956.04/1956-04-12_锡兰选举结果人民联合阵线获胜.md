Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 11th - Colombo News: The results of the Ceylon parliamentary elections were fully announced on the evening of the 11th. The People's United Front achieved a great victory, winning 51 of the 95 seats elected in this election. The United National Party, the original ruling party, retained the eight seats it won in the first round of voting on April 5th.

According to Reuters, the distribution of the remaining seats is as follows: New Lanka Sama Samaja Party 14 seats, Communist Party 3 seats, Federal Party 10 seats, Independents 7 seats, Tamil Resistance Front 1 seat, Tamil Congress 1 seat.

The leader of the United National Party and Prime Minister of Ceylon, Sir John Kotelawala, submitted his resignation to the Governor-General of Ceylon, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, that afternoon.

The Ceylon United National Party has been the ruling party since 1947 (the year before Ceylon gained dominion status). It has consistently held a majority of seats in previous parliaments. In the last parliament, it held 54 of the total 101 seats. Public opinion believes that the United National Party's disastrous defeat in this election was due to its unpopular pro-Western policies.

According to the Press Trust of India, the leader of the People's United Front, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, will be sworn in as Prime Minister on April 12th. Bandaranaike won the support of the Ceylonese people in this election by adopting a platform of neutrality.

The Ceylonese public welcomes the victory of the People's United Front in this election. The "Ceylon Daily Times" said that if Bandaranaike firmly adopts a neutral position in international relations and does not participate in any bloc, Ceylon will make a real contribution to maintaining peace in this part of the world.

Commenting on the consternation expressed by American and British newspapers over the results of the Ceylon election, the newspaper said that this was understandable, "because although the United National Party government claimed that Ceylon had an independent foreign policy, in reality it was counted as a member of the Anglo-American bloc."

    锡兰选举结果人民联合阵线获胜
    新华社新德里11日电　科伦坡消息：锡兰国会选举的结果已经在十一日晚上全部揭晓。人民联合阵线取得了巨大的胜利，它在这次选出的九十五个议席中获得了五十一席。原来执政的统一国民党所得到的席位仍然是四月五日第一次投票中所获得的八席。
    据路透社消息，其余议席的分布情况是：新平等社会党十四席、共产党三席、联邦党十席、独立人士七席、泰米尔抵抗阵线一席、泰米尔大会党一席。
    统一国民党领袖、锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉在当天下午向锡兰总督古涅狄莱克提出了辞呈。
    锡兰统一国民党从1947年（即锡兰取得自治领地位的前一年）以来就是执政党。它在历届国会中始终拥有多数席位。在上届国会总共一百零一个席位中它共拥有五十四席。舆论认为，统一国民党在这次大选中的遭到惨败，是由于它所执行的亲西方的政策不得人心。
    据印度报业托辣斯的消息说，人民联合阵线的领袖班达拉奈克将在四月十二日宣誓就任总理职务。班达拉奈克在这次选举中是以采取中立政策的纲领取得锡兰人民支持的。
    锡兰公众欢迎人民联合阵线在这次选举中获得的胜利。锡兰“时代晨报”说，如果班达拉奈克在国际关系中坚决采取中立和不参加任何集团的立场，锡兰就会在维护世界这一部分的和平方面作出真正的贡献。
    这家报纸就美国和英国报纸对锡兰选举结果所表示的惊惶不安发表评论说，这是可以理解的，“因为尽管统一国民党政府宣称锡兰具有独立的外交政策，但在实际上它是被算作美英集团的成员的”。
