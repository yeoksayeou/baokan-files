    The Path to Maintaining National Independence and International Peace

    On April 9th, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo delivered a statement to the parliament regarding the government's program. This was the first policy statement by Sastroamidjojo's new cabinet to the new parliament. It indicated that the Indonesian government would resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and independence, further oppose colonialism, and implement a policy of peaceful coexistence and strengthened international friendly cooperation.

    Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo stated that the government program is supported by all government parties and has the nature of a relatively clear national program. He requested the parliament to supervise the implementation of the government program.

    In his statement explaining the program, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo first emphasized the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements and the recovery of West Irian. The so-called Round Table Conference agreements were shackles imposed on the Indonesian people by Dutch colonialists in 1949, which seriously hindered Indonesia from achieving complete independence. West Irian, which constitutes an integral part of Indonesian territory, is still occupied by the Netherlands, which also damages Indonesia's national independence and the integrity of its national sovereignty. The Indonesian people have waged a long and heroic struggle to abolish the Round Table Conference agreements and recover West Irian. Now the Indonesian government has decided to abolish this agreement and recover West Irian, and has submitted a bill to abolish the Round Table Conference agreements to the parliament, while announcing that a province will be established in West Irian, which is a measure that fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the Indonesian people.

    In order to eliminate another obstacle in the national revival work, the Indonesian government has decided to fight against armed bandits operating in the country. These armed bandits are tools of foreign colonialism attempting to subvert Indonesia. They have consistently received assistance and support from foreign forces and are a serious threat to Indonesia's independence and security. Therefore, the Indonesian government's eradication of these bandits is the eradication of the remaining forces of foreign colonialism in Indonesia, and it is also a safeguard of national sovereignty and independence.

    Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo advocated implementing an independent and active foreign policy, and actively expanding and strengthening Indonesia's relations with any country on the basis of mutual respect and sovereign equality. The Asian-African Conference, jointly initiated by Indonesia, India, Burma and other countries, expanded the peace zone and strengthened friendly cooperation between the peoples of Asian and African countries, thereby further consolidating Indonesia's independent development. The new government program emphasizes the implementation of an independent and active foreign policy, continuing to exchange cultural delegations with various countries and conclude international cultural agreements, and contributing to international mutual understanding and world peace, which will further enhance Indonesia's international status and prestige.

    Sastroamidjojo pointed out in his statement that due to the international situation bringing about new problems in the Asian-African region, his government hopes to consider the possibility of holding a second Asian-African conference together with the Colombo countries. This constructive suggestion, which is conducive to strengthening peace and international cooperation in the Asian-African region, will obviously be valued by Asian and African countries and peoples.

    The Indonesian Prime Minister believes that atomic energy should be used for peaceful purposes, and he expressed regret over the nuclear weapons tests to be conducted in the Pacific and Indonesian marine areas. At the same time, he hopes that China, Japan, the Mongolian People's Republic, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan and other countries can be admitted to the United Nations in order to realize the universality of the United Nations as a world organization. These propositions are helpful to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation between nations.

    These positive foreign policies put forward by Sastroamidjojo in his statement have received broad support from Indonesian political parties and public opinion. Mangunsarkoro, acting chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, pointed out in the "Indonesian Torch" on April 10th: The important issue at present is to realize this government program that has been agreed upon in all aspects. All those who participate in the government have the obligation to carefully implement this political program, and those who do not participate in the government should bear the responsibility of supervising the implementation of the political program. This clearly reflects the common understanding of all aspects of Indonesia.

    The Chinese people welcome the Indonesian government's foreign policy program, believing that this is an important sign of the progress made by the Indonesian people in their struggle to consolidate national unity, oppose colonialism and strengthen the cause of international peace. The Chinese people sincerely hope to further strengthen friendly and cooperative relations with the Indonesian people, and jointly make greater contributions to implementing the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and strengthening the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

### 维护民族独立和国际和平的道路

    维护民族独立和国际和平的道路
    印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约四月九日在国会发表了关于政府纲领的声明。这是沙斯特罗阿米佐约新内阁在新的国会发表的第一次政策声明。它表明，印度尼西亚政府将坚决地维护国家主权和民族独立，进一步反对殖民主义，并执行和平共处和加强国际友好合作政策。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理表示，政府纲领为所有政府党派所支持，具有比较明确的全国纲领的性质。他要求国会监督政府纲领的执行。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在阐明纲领的声明中，首先强调废除圆桌会议协定和收复西伊里安的问题。所谓圆桌会议协定，是荷兰殖民主义者在1949年强加在印度尼西亚人民头上的桎梏，它严重地妨碍了印度尼西亚取得完全的独立。而构成印度尼西亚领土不可分割的一部分的西伊里安，至今仍被荷兰占领着，同样损害了印度尼西亚的民族独立和国家主权的完整。印度尼西亚人民为废除圆桌会议协定和收复西伊里安，曾进行了长期的英勇斗争。现在印度尼西亚政府决定废除这个协定和收回西伊里安，并且已把废除圆桌会议协定的法案提交了国会，同时宣布将在西伊里安建省，这是完全符合印度尼西亚人民根本利益的措施。
    为消除国家复兴工作中的另一障碍，印度尼西亚政府决定对在国内活动的武装匪徒进行斗争。这些武装匪徒是外国殖民主义企图颠覆印度尼西亚的工具，一贯接受外来势力的接济和支持，是对印度尼西亚独立和安全的严重威胁。因此，印度尼西亚政府肃清这些匪徒，就是肃清外国殖民主义在印度尼西亚的残余势力，同样是维护国家的主权和独立。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理主张实行独立的积极的外交政策，主张在互相尊重和主权平等的基础上积极扩大并且加强印度尼西亚同任何国家的关系。印度尼西亚同印度、缅甸等国家共同倡导的亚非会议，扩大了和平地区和加强了亚非国家人民间友好合作，从而更加巩固了印度尼西亚的独立发展。新的政府纲领强调要执行独立的积极的外交政策，继续同各国互派文化代表团和缔结国际文化协定，对国际互相谅解和世界和平作出贡献，这必将进一步提高印度尼西亚的国际地位和威望。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约在声明中特别指出，由于国际局势引起了亚非范围内的新问题，他的政府希望同科伦坡国家一道考虑举行第二次亚非会议的可能性。这个有助于加强亚非地区和平和国际合作的建设性的建议，显然会受到亚非各国和人民的重视。
    印度尼西亚总理认为，原子能应该用于和平目的，他对即将在太平洋和印度尼西亚海洋地区进行的核子武器试验表示遗憾。同时，他希望中国、日本、蒙古人民共和国、突尼斯、摩洛哥、苏丹和其他国家能被接纳进入联合国，以实现联合国这个世界组织的普遍性。这些主张都是有助于加强国际间的互相信任和合作的。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约在声明中提出的这些具有积极意义的对外政策，已经得到印度尼西亚各政党和舆论的广泛支持。印度尼西亚国民党代理主席曼贡萨科罗在四月十日的“印度尼西亚火炬报”上指出：目前的重要问题是实现各方面都已经表示同意的这个政府纲领，凡是参加政府的人都有义务来谨慎地执行这个政纲，而那些没有参加政府的人应当负起监督政纲执行情况的责任。这显然反映了印度尼西亚各方面的共同认识。
    中国人民欢迎印度尼西亚政府的这个对外政策纲领，认为这是印度尼西亚人民为巩固民族团结，反对殖民主义和加强国际和平事业所进行的斗争向前发展的重要标志。中国人民诚挚地希望同印度尼西亚人民进一步加强友好合作的关系，共同来对贯彻亚非会议决议、加强亚洲和世界的和平事业作出更大的贡献。
