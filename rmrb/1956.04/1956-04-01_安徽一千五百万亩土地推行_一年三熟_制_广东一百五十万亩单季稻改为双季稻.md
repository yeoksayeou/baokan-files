Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 30th: Anhui Province will grow three crops a year on fifteen million mu of land this year. Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are now starting spring sowing half a month earlier. In the Yangtze River region, where the focus is on two rice crops and one dryland crop per year, the work of cultivating early rice seedlings has generally begun, using the method of cultivating dry seedlings. In the hilly areas of northern Anhui, where the focus is on one rice crop and two dryland crops per year, the sowing of the first season of spring corn is underway. In the Huaibei Plain, where the main practice is three consecutive seasons of dryland crops, farmers have already cultivated seedlings of sweet potatoes and spring potatoes.

In order to ensure that all three seasons of crops have sufficient water for irrigation and adequate fertilizer for nourishment, the province's large-scale farmland water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaign is still in full swing. The completed farmland water conservancy projects can increase the drought resistance capacity of more than ten million mu of farmland by twenty days; the accumulated fertilizer amounts to more than 300 billion jin, more than double the amount in the same period last year.

Last year, some land in Anhui Province that implemented the "three crops a year" cropping system increased grain production by more than 900 million jin just by adding one season of late autumn crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th: Guangdong Province has converted more than 1.54 million mu of single-season rice fields into double-season rice fields. The output of these rice fields this year can be increased by at least double. At present, members of agricultural cooperatives in various regions are busy cultivating strong seedlings of early rice and plowing and harrowing the fields more.

These rice fields were originally mostly located in dry or low-lying areas, and have only been planted with one season of rice for a long time. Due to extensive cultivation, the yield was very low, and they were called "waiting-for-rain fields" and "backward fields." In order to convert single-season rice fields into double-season rice fields, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions began digging mud into the fields to improve the soil as early as the end of last year, and at the same time, they built irrigation canals, embankments, mountain ponds and other water conservancy projects according to local conditions.

### 安徽一千五百万亩土地推行“一年三熟”制  广东一百五十万亩单季稻改为双季稻

    安徽一千五百万亩土地推行“一年三熟”制
    广东一百五十万亩单季稻改为双季稻
    据新华社合肥30日电　安徽省今年有一千五百万亩土地将长出三季庄稼。现在各地农业生产合作社纷纷提前半个月开始春播。推行两季水稻一季旱粮为主的沿长江地区，早稻的育秧工作已经普遍开始，并且采用的方法是育旱秧。推行一季水稻两季旱粮为主的淮南丘陵地区，第一季春玉米的播种工作正在进行。淮北平原主要推行三季旱粮连作，农民已经培育了甘薯和春马铃薯的幼苗。
    为保证三季作物都有足够的水灌溉和有充分的肥料滋养，全省大规模的兴修农田水利和积肥运动仍在紧张进行。现在已经修成的农田水利工程，可以使一千多万亩农田的抗旱能力提高二十天；已经积存的肥料有三千多亿斤，比去年同期增加一倍多。
    安徽省去年实行“一年三熟”耕作制度的一些土地，仅增种一季晚秋作物，就增产了九亿多斤粮食。
    据新华社广州30日电　广东省有一百五十四万多亩单季稻田改变为双季稻田。这些稻田今年的产量最少可增加一倍。目前各地农业合作社的社员们正忙于培育早稻的壮秧和在田里多犁多耙。
    这些稻田原来多处在干燥或低洼的地带，长时期以来只种一季水稻，并且因耕作粗放产量很低而被称为“望天田”、“落后田”。为了把单季稻田改变为双季稻田，早在去年年底，各地的农业生产合作社就开始挖泥入田，改良土壤，同时按照当地条件分别兴修灌溉渠、堤围、山塘等水利工程。
