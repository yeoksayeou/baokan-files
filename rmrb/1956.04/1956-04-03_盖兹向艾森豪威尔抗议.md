Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 2nd: John Gates, editor of the "Daily Worker," protested to U.S. President Eisenhower and Treasury Secretary Humphrey on April 1st regarding the U.S. government's illegal seizure of the "Daily Worker" offices and the confiscation of the newspaper's archives.

    In a telegram to Eisenhower, Gates pointed out that the actions of U.S. government officials were a "direct interference with the exercise of the constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of the press," and demanded that Eisenhower "restore the principles of law and justice."

    In a telegram to Treasury Secretary Humphrey, Gates strongly protested the Treasury Department personnel's infringement on the property of the "Daily Worker" and protested their "taking of subscriber names and addresses and other materials unrelated to tax issues." The telegram demanded that the Treasury Department compensate for the damages caused.
