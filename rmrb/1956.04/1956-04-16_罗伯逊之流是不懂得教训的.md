The likes of Robertson do not understand lessons
Li Gao

Why is the United States delaying the Sino-American talks in Geneva? What is the United States going to do to China and the Far East? Some answers to these questions were revealed at the recent meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States discussing the "aid" foreign plan.

Robertson, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, testified before the committee on the "aid" foreign plan on the 11th. In this testimony, Robertson repeated Dulles' old tune, shouting that the Far Eastern "situation is tense," and warned people not to "misunderstand," and not to think that "the United States may be about to reach a political reconciliation with the Chinese Communist regime." This nakedly exposes that the U.S. side used various means in the Sino-American talks to hinder the progress of the talks, which originally stemmed from a U.S. policy of not wanting reconciliation.

Why not political reconciliation? Robertson admitted without concealment that because the United States wanted to continue to occupy Taiwan and use it to intensify its aggression and subversive activities against China. Robertson said that in the U.S. "West Pacific island chain" front, "Taiwan still occupies a key position" and is "indispensable" for the United States to carry out military aggression and subversive activities against China. He even dreamily claimed that as long as the United States still forcibly occupies Taiwan, it can "provide" some "source of hope" to those remnants who want to subvert China.

Robertson's remarks show that the United States is not only still dreaming this desperate dream of subverting China, but will also intensify its support for certain forces under its protection to threaten the Chinese people and Asian peace. They announced that in the U.S.'s 1957 fiscal year of more than 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in "military assistance" and "economic assistance" to the Far East, 80 to 90 percent "will be given to those 'countries' adjacent to Communist China that maintain large armed forces"—mainly providing "more jet aircraft and training for army reserve forces" to the Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem cliques, to support them in adopting anti-peace provocative activities.

However, Robertson obviously also realized that the U.S.'s actions of showing its fangs would arouse greater resentment throughout the world, especially in Asia; therefore, he spared no effort to distort the truth, attempting to shift the responsibility for creating tension to the Chinese people. According to him, the Chinese people building a railway in a certain place and building an airport in another place constitutes a "serious" "threat of armed aggression" "in the entire Far East." This is truly typical modern American logic: The United States sending troops to establish the "Taiwan Defense Command" and the headquarters of the "Task Force Air Force" on the territory of other countries it forcibly occupies, and holding large-scale provocative exercises next to the doorsteps of other countries, can all be named "self-defense" or "defense," while other countries building a railway on their own territory becomes a "threat of aggression" to the United States thousands of miles away. Of course, this logic is not new, and people have long learned it from the likes of Goebbels.

If the likes of Robertson think that their military threats can stop the determination of 600 million Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan, their bloody dollars and arms can destroy the powerful trend of Asian people demanding peaceful coexistence, and their blatant lies can deceive world opinion, then they are too naive. Even if they have not learned enough lessons from the tragic failures of the past U.S. interference in China's civil war and the launch of the Korean War, then the series of condemnations of the U.S. Asian policy recently put forward by Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Cambodian Prince Sihanouk, and millions of voters in Ceylon should be able to make people wake up. However, as the Indian "National Herald" pointed out not long ago, Dulles and Robertson, despite having recently traveled around Asia, "have learned nothing, forgotten nothing, and discovered nothing." Therefore, they are still walking blindly towards the abyss of greater failure.

    罗伯逊之流是不懂得教训的
    李高
    美国为什么要拖延日内瓦的中美会议呢？美国将要对中国、对远东干些什么呢？这些问题，在美国众议院外交委员会最近审议“援”外计划的会议上得到了一部分答案。
    美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊十一日在这个委员会上就“援”外计划作证。在这个作证中，罗伯逊重复杜勒斯的老调，叫喊远东“局势紧张”，并且告诫人们不要“误解”，不要以为“美国可能就要同中国共产党政权达成政治和解了”。这首先就赤裸裸地暴露出，美方在中美会谈中使用各种手段来阻碍会谈的进展，原来是根据美国的一个不要和解的既定政策出发的。
    为什么不要政治和解呢？罗伯逊并不隐讳地承认，因为美国想继续霸占台湾，并利用它来加紧对中国进行侵略活动和颠覆活动。罗伯逊说，在美国的“西太平洋岛屿链锁”战线中，“台湾仍然占着一个具有关键性的地位”，是美国对中国进行军事侵略和颠覆活动所“不可少的”。他甚至梦呓似地声称，只要美国还强占着台湾，就能给那些想要颠覆中国的残余分子“提给”什么“希望之源”。
    罗伯逊的谈话说明，美国不但还在做着这个绝望的颠覆中国之梦，而且还将加紧支持它所庇护下的某些势力，来向中国人民和亚洲的和平进行威胁。他们宣布，在1957年度美国给予远东地区的二十三亿余美元的“军事援助”和“经济援助”中，百分之八、九十“将是给毗邻共产党中国而维持着大量武装部队的那些‘国家’”——主要是向蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳集团“提供更多的喷气飞机，训练陆军后备部队”等等，以支持他们采取反和平的挑衅活动。
    但是，罗伯逊显然也意识到，美国这样露出青脸獠牙的行动，是会在全世界、特别是在亚洲激起更大反感的；因此，他不惜煞费苦心地来歪曲事实真相，企图把制造紧张局势的责任推到中国人民头上。据他说，中国人民在什么地方修建一条铁路，又在什么地方修了飞机场，这就构成了“在整个远东”的“严重”的“武装侵略的威胁”了。这真是典型的现代美国的逻辑：美国派出军队到它所强占着的别的国家的领土上设立“协防台湾司令部”和“特遣空军部队”总部、在别的国家的大门旁边举行大规模的挑衅性演习等等，一概可以命名为“自卫”或“防御”，而别的国家即使在自己的领土上修一条铁路，那就成了对万里之外的美国的“侵略威胁”。当然，这种逻辑并不新鲜，是人们从戈培尔之流那里早就领教过了的。
    罗伯逊之流如果以为，他们的武力威胁能够阻挡六亿中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的决心、他们的血腥的美元和军火能够破坏亚洲人民要求和平共处的强大潮流、他们的信口雌黄能够蒙混世界舆论的耳目，那就未免太天真一点了。即使在过去的美国干涉中国内战和发动朝鲜战争等悲惨失败中还没有取得足够的教训，那末，最近从印度尼赫鲁总理、柬埔寨西哈努克亲王到锡兰的千百万选民对美国亚洲政策所提出的一系列的谴责，也应该能使人猛省了。然而，正如不久前印度的“国民先驱报”所指出的，杜勒斯和罗伯逊尽管最近在亚洲跑了一?，但“什么也没有学到，什么也没有忘掉，而且什么也没有发现”。因此，他们还是在自己蒙着自己的眼睛向更大的失败深渊走去。
