    The exhibition featured more than 2,000 intuitive teaching aids, all made and collected by teachers and students of Beijing Normal University.

    北京师大举办直观教具展览会
    北京师范大学举办了一个直观教具展览会。
    会上展出的两千多件直观教具都是北京师范大学的教师和学生自己制造和搜集的。物理系教授刘世楷等制造了新式活动星图等十三个模型和仪器。当转动新式活动星图的时候，可以查出北京及北纬四十度地带每个时辰的星象、星座的方向和高度，推算各星及太阳出没地平的时刻和方向等。
    音乐系的教师用录音的方法搜集的四百多首各民族地区的民族器乐曲，也在会上展出。（据新华社讯）
