    欧洲反法西斯战士集会反对西德军国主义复活
    据新华社柏林17日电　魏玛消息：来自欧洲十多个国家的反法西斯主义抵抗运动的战士们和德意志民主共和国公民数万人四月十五日在魏玛附近的布痕瓦尔德集中营的场地上举行大会，庆祝各国受法西斯囚禁者获得解放十一周年纪念日。大会通过了一项宣言，号召所有爱好和平的人们联合起来保卫和平，为反对军国主义和法西斯主义在西德复活而斗争。
    在大会上，许多位曾经在布痕瓦尔德集中营及其他希特勒集中营被囚禁过的抵抗运动战士发表了演说。
    在大会的前一天（四月十四日），国际布痕瓦尔德委员会曾经在魏玛举行会议，讨论了西德重新军国主义化给世界和平事业带来的危险。委员会通过决议，抗议西德的重新军国主义化和重新法西斯主义化。决议还要求从西德监狱中释放所有那些曾经反对法西斯主义及其复活的人们。
