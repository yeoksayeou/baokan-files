Shandong Shen County: Every Village Has a Farmers' Spare-Time School

In Shandong Province, Shen County, every village now has a farmers' spare-time school. The entire county's fifty townships have youth literacy brigades, and 512 villages have youth literacy detachments. 475 villages have established work-point recording study classes. As of April 5th, 85.3% of the farmers in the county who should participate in literacy learning have already entered farmers' spare-time schools. Among township cadres, 96% of those who are illiterate or semi-literate are participating in learning.

In the past few months, more than 13,200 farmers in this county have learned to keep work-point records. Among the county's 237 main township cadres, 140 are no longer illiterate. Twenty villages have basically eliminated illiteracy among young people. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山东省莘县全县村村有了农民业余学校；全县五十个乡都有了青年扫盲大队，512个村都有了青年扫盲分队；有475个村成立了记工学习班。到四月五日为止，全县应该参加扫盲学习的农民，已经有85.3％进了农民业余学校。乡干部中的文盲和半文盲，参加学习的占96％。
    在最近几个月中，这个县已有一万三千二百多个农民学会了记工账。全县237名主要乡干部中有140人不再是文盲了。有二十个村已经基本上扫除了青年中的文盲。　（新华社）
