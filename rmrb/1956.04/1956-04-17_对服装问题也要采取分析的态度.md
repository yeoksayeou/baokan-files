    An Analytical Approach Should Also Be Taken to Clothing Issues
    Yang Jiao
    Recently, the calls to make clothing more diverse and beautiful have attracted considerable widespread attention. This embodies the people's desire to make life better, which should be welcomed and supported.
    To support the growth of new things, one must inevitably struggle with old things. Don't people often say "no destruction, no construction"? This is naturally a truth.
    Old things should be "destroyed," but the question is what old things should be "destroyed" and how should they be "destroyed." This requires study. If one "destroys" everything indiscriminately without research, it may not have a good effect and may even have a bad influence.
    What are the obstacles that must be "destroyed" on the road to improving clothing? This is the conservative thinking that many publications have already criticized. This conservative thinking can be said to be something similar to prejudice, similar to the force of habit. People with this kind of thinking frown when they hear opinions advocating changes in clothing, and they unanalytically think that this is "bourgeois ideology." In their view, it seems that simplicity, monotony, and lack of color are the best manifestations of "working-class ideology." This is ridiculous.
    However, in order to remove ideological obstacles on the road forward, some comrades seem to have forgotten the necessary analysis, at least in their attitude towards so-called "cadre uniforms" (or "uniforms").
    We cannot deny that everyone wearing the same style of "cadre uniform," especially young female comrades, is not ideal, and there is no need to maintain this situation today. However, "cadre uniforms" were produced in the years of arduous revolutionary struggle. At that time, the interests of the revolution made us despise the peacetime customs of pursuing personal comfort and dressing up. Simple cadre uniforms became a symbol of the revolution. In particular, the emergence of "female soldiers"—young girls wearing soldiers' clothes—shocked the world. The spirit of hard struggle they represented did not arouse people's contempt, but their respect. Even in the early days of national liberation, it played a huge role in overcoming the decadent and extravagant atmosphere in the cities left to us by the reactionaries.
    The conditions are different now. We want to put on new clothes for a new and happy life. Moreover, wearing ordinary calico is not more expensive than wearing good gray cloth or blue cloth, and wearing various women's clothing can also save some fabric compared to wearing "cadre uniforms." Therefore, it is no longer correct to not reform clothing and to oppose reform. Some conservative views can indeed be the object of satire. However, some cartoonists, while satirizing conservative thinking, have excessively attacked the "cadre uniform" itself, which does not need to be, and should not be,丑化. For example, in a cartoon in the People's Daily on March 9, two adults are wearing ridiculously small cadre uniforms, and a small person is wearing a ridiculously large cadre uniform. In other newspapers and periodicals, people who wear "cadre uniforms" are deliberately drawn as "disheveled and dirty" and then ridiculed. In this way, the matter of wearing uniforms is丑化. Some people simply criticize wearing "cadre uniforms" as "a nun-like, prematurely aging dress." Many people丑化 the wearing of "cadre uniforms" while advocating new clothing. If this is not aiming at the wrong target, it is at least expanding the target.
    New, more suitable, and beautiful clothing styles should be promoted, but wearing old "cadre uniforms" should also be a matter of personal choice.
    In the past, if some people did not wear their original clothes and instead made "cadre uniforms" to wear, it was a waste; then, if now some people have "cadre uniforms" but dare not wear them or disdain to wear them, and are busy making new clothes, isn't this also exceeding the current economic level of our people?
    People say that Soviet women's clothing is now generally more beautiful than ours. This is certainly true. But even in the Soviet Union, more than 30 years after the success of the revolution, according to authoritative sources, they still "do not imitate Parisian fashions at any time" and "often wear padded jackets that ruin people's beautiful lines." If we promote simplicity and thrift at the same time as we promote the improvement of clothing styles, wouldn't we have more reason to do so?
    Any correct opinion, as long as it is unilaterally exaggerated and absolutized without analysis, will turn into the opposite. Promoting the improvement of clothing will not be an exception.

    对服装问题也要采取分析的态度
    杨角
    近来，提倡把服装改得多样化一些和美丽一些的呼声，已经引起了相当普遍的注意。这里面，体现着人民要求把生活变得更加美好的愿望，这是应该欢迎和支持的。
    要支持新东西生长，总不免要和旧东西斗争。人们不是常讲“不破不立”吗？这自然是一条真理。
    旧东西是应该“破”的，问题是要“破”什么旧东西，应该怎样“破”，这就需要研究一下。如果，不加研究，不分青红皂白，乱“破”一气，那就未必能收到好效果，有的时候还会带来坏影响哩。
    什么是改善服装道路上必须“破”的障碍呢？这就是许多刊物已经加以批判的守旧思想。这种守旧思想，可以说是一种类似成见、类似习惯势力的东西。有这种思想情绪的人，听到提倡改变服装的意见，就皱起眉来，不加分析地认为这是“资产阶级思想”，在他们看来，似乎简陋、单调、无色彩就是“工人阶级思想”的最好表现。这是可笑的。
    可是，为了扫除前进道路上的思想障碍，有些同志，似乎也忘了必要的分析。至少是在对待所谓“干部服”（或“制服”）的态度上就有这种情形。
    我们不能否认，大家都穿一个式样的“干部服”，特别是年青女同志也穿“干部服”，这并不是什么合于理想的事，在今天更没有必要把这种状况保持下去。可是，“干部服”是产生在艰苦的革命斗争的年代，在那个时候，革命的利益使我们鄙薄那种讲求个人生活舒适、讲求梳妆打扮的承平时代的风习。粗朴的干部服成了革命的象征。特别是“女兵”——穿着士兵衣服的年青姑娘的出现，曾经震惊了世俗，她们所代表的艰苦奋斗的精神，不是引起人们的鄙视，而是引起人们的尊敬。即使在全国解放的初期，它在克服反动派遗留给我们的城市中奢靡腐朽的风气上，也起了巨大的作用。
    现在的条件不同了。我们要为新的幸福的生活穿上新装。而且穿一般的花布并不比穿好的灰布、蓝布贵，穿各种女装还可以比穿“干部服”节省一些布料。因此，在服装上再不改革，而且反对改革，就不再是正确的了。有些守旧的观点也确乎可以成为讽刺的对象。可是，有的漫画家，在讽刺守旧思想的同时，对于不必丑化、也不应该丑化的“干部服”本身，却进行了过份的攻击。人民日报三月九日的一幅漫画中，两个大人穿上小得可笑的干部服，一个小人穿上大得可笑的干部服，就是一个例子。在其他报刊上，也有故意把穿“干部服”的人画得“蓬首垢面”，然后加以嘲笑的。这样，就把穿着制服这件事丑化了。还有人干脆批评穿“干部服”是“像尼姑一样的、未老先衰的打扮”。许多人在提倡新服装的同时，连带把穿“干部服”这件事丑化了。这如果不是瞅错了目标，至少也是把目标扩大化了。
    新的、更适用的、美观的服装样式应该提倡，但对于穿旧“干部服”，也应该听其自愿。
    如果在过去，有的人把原有的各式衣服不穿，另做“干部服”来穿，这是浪费；那么，现在若是弄得有的人已经有了“干部服”而不敢穿，不屑穿，也得忙着做新衣，这不也是超过了我国人民目前的经济水平么？
    人们说，苏联妇女的服装现在一般比我国的美观。这诚然是不错的。但是即使在革命成功三十多年之后的苏联，根据权威的说法，究竟也还“没有随时模仿巴黎的时装样式”，“还常常穿着破坏人的线条美的棉袄”。如果我们在提倡改进服装样式的时候，同时提倡朴素和节约，岂不是有更多的理由么？
    任何正确的意见，只要不加分析地给以片面的夸大和绝对化，就会变成相反的东西。提倡改善服装也不会是例外。
