    Introducing Good Books for Young People to Learn Writing
    Ai Ken
    Many young people who love literature often write to writers, artists, and newspaper editorial departments, asking for answers to the "secrets" of writing. However, there is never any "secret" to writing, and no one has the ability to fully answer this question. However, such requests reflect the existence of practical problems that urgently need to be solved among the vast number of young people who love literature. Recently, People's Literature Publishing House and China Youth Publishing House have published several books to guide young people in writing, including "On Writing," "To Young Authors," "Lu Xun on Creation," "Writers on Creation," and "On Cultivating Young Writers," which answer several fundamental questions about writing.
    Gorky's "To Young Authors" collects fifty-three letters he wrote to young authors; "Lu Xun on Creation" includes twenty-nine letters Lu Xun wrote to young authors, six prefaces and introductions to young authors' works, nine essays on writing, and six short articles on his own writing experience; "On Writing" and "Writers on Creation" include more than forty essays by famous Soviet and Chinese writers; "On Cultivating Young Writers" selects more than ten essays by the Soviet "Pravda," "Literary Gazette," and writers on the issue of cultivating young writers. These books have several significant characteristics: the content is very rich and practical, providing a variety of creative experiences based on the different creative paths of various writers, involving writers' worldviews, creative methods, life experiences, writing processes, artistic conceptions, writing techniques, and other issues. This has profound and rich guiding significance for the writing of young authors.
    These books use significant space to tell young authors how to improve their ideological cultivation. The mission of writers, who are called "engineers of the human soul," is noble. Writers should educate people and influence life through literary works. Therefore, writers should have advanced ideas and become active builders of socialism. For young authors who have experienced less struggle, it is even more important and urgent to strengthen their cultivation and training in this area. Ostrovsky put it very well, "Only when a young writer grows into an adult, grows into a fighter, and grows together with the whole country, can he become a writer" ("On Writing," p. 48).
    Therefore, young authors should enthusiastically throw themselves into life and keenly observe and feel life. Gorky believes that if an author is "outside of life," "living on a deserted island," then it is "equal to plundering oneself" ("To Young Authors," p. 39). He requires authors to observe life comprehensively and deeply. Only in this way can they see the essence and mainstream of life.
    Everyone acknowledges that life is as important to creation as water is to fish and soil is to flowers and plants, but in reality, some people float on the surface of life like "dragonflies skimming the water"; some people, although they have thrown themselves into life, cannot discern the essence and mainstream of life. To change this situation, it is necessary to master the Marxist worldview, correct the attitude towards life, and improve the ability to observe.
    From these books, you can also gain useful insights into correctly approaching literary writing. Writing is a serious and creative mental labor. However, some young authors adopt a crude and hasty attitude towards creation. Because of this, it is very necessary to remember the teachings of the older generation of writers. Fumanov, the author of "Chapayev," said: "Writing should be strict, strict, and strict again. Seeking speed—this means not climbing up the mountain, but rolling down the hillside" ("On Writing," p. 245). Gorky taught us: "This is writing for millions of people, so you can't be careless."
    Some young people also believe that the difference between creation and other labor mainly depends on the author's "talent," "inspiration," etc. Therefore, they fantasize about digging out a golden baby with one stroke without spending hard work, or are overly intoxicated with their own "talent" and "inspiration." This is an extremely wrong and dangerous idea. The creative experience of many famous writers proves that any successful work is obtained because the author has paid all his heart and labor.
    Writing is a difficult and very challenging thing. However, this is by no means to make young people "shrink back in fear" or "give up in the face of difficulties." On the contrary, it is to make young people face up to and have the courage to overcome this difficulty, just as Fiedin said: "Those who feel difficulty when writing are the ones who can achieve excellent results, not those who find writing easy" ("On Writing," p. 207).
    How to create the image of typical characters is also an important issue repeatedly elaborated on in these books. Based on their own creative experience, writers repeatedly teach young authors: the image of characters must be taken from life to create living, flesh-and-blood character images. Gorky believes that to write people "alive," it is necessary to "discover and point out the unique characteristics of language, behavior, posture, appearance, smile, and demeanor of each character," "People, whether in appearance or in heart, have something unique" ("To Young Authors," p. 73). At the same time, he also pointed out that although the author is facing the reader, "you must not preach to the reader. As a reader, I only need beautiful, correct, and vivid images; let me draw my own conclusions" ("To Young Authors," p. 22). Obviously, these teachings will be of great benefit to overcoming the tendency of formulaic and conceptual writing that is common among young writers.
    The guidance of these books for young writers is specific and meticulous. For example, advising young people to first write about things they are familiar with, to first write short stories, to strengthen the cultivation of literary language to make it refined, vivid, and accurate, to read as much as possible, and not to be overwhelmed by minor achievements, etc., all touch on specific and practical problems in young people's writing.

    介绍几部青年学习写作的好书
    艾克恩
    许多爱好文艺的青年经常向作家、艺术家、报刊的编辑部写信，要求解答什么是写作的“秘诀”。可是，写作从来没有什么“秘诀”，任何人也没有本领完满回答这问题。然而，这样的要求反映出在广大爱好文学的青年中间，的确存在着急待解决的实际问题。最近人民文学出版社和中国青年出版社出版了“论写作”“给青年作者”“鲁迅谈创作”“作家谈创作”“关于培养青年作家”几部指导青年写作的书，回答了有关写作的几个根本问题。
    高尔基的“给青年作者”，收集了他给青年作者的五十三封书信；“鲁迅谈创作”包括鲁迅给青年作者的二十九封书信，给青年作者的作品写的六篇小引和序，九篇写作论文和谈自己写作经验的六篇短文；“论写作”和“作家谈创作”包括苏联和中国著名作家的四十多篇论文；“关于培养青年作家”选辑了苏联“真理报”
  “文学报”和作家有关培养青年作家问题的十多篇论文。这几部书具有几个显著的特点：内容非常丰富而实际，根据各个作家不同的创作道路，提供了多种多样的创作经验，涉及到了作家的世界观、创作方法、生活体验、写作过程、艺术构思、写作技巧等问题。这对于青年作者的写作有着深刻而丰富的指导意义。
    这些书以重要的篇幅告诉青年作者怎样去提高自己的思想修养的问题。被称为“人类灵魂的工程师”的作家的使命是崇高的，作家要通过文学作品教育人，影响生活。因此，作家就应该具有先进的思想，成为积极的社会主义的建设者。对于经受斗争锻炼较少的青年作者，首先加强这方面的修养和锻炼，是显得更加重要而迫切的。奥斯特洛夫斯基说得非常好，“青年作家只有在长成人、长成一个战士，并且与全国一齐成长着的时候，他才能成为一个作家”。（“论写作”48页）
    因此，青年作者们要热情地投入生活和敏锐地观察感受生活。高尔基认为，如果作者“处在生活之外”，“住在无人的荒岛上”，那就“等于掠夺自己”（“给青年作者”39页）。他要求作者全面而深入地观察生活。只有这样，才能看出生活中的本质与主流。
    人人都承认生活对于创作就如同水对于鱼、土壤对于花草一样的重要，但实际上却有些人像“蜻蜓点水”式的浮在生活的水面上；有些人虽然投入了生活，却不能洞察出生活的本质与主流。要改变这种情况，必须掌握马克思主义世界观，端正生活态度，提高观察力。
    从这些书里，也可以获得正确地对待文学写作的有益的启示。写作是一种严肃的、创造性的脑力劳动。但有些青年作者对创作采取了粗制滥造，急于求成的不严肃的态度。正因为这样，牢记前辈作家们的教导是十分必要的。“夏伯阳”的作者富曼诺夫说：“写作要严格，严格，再严格。求快——这意味着不是往山上爬，而是从山坡上向下滚。”（“论写作”245页）高尔基教导我们：“这是为千千万万的人而写作，因此就不能马虎。”
    也有些青年认为创作所以不同于别的劳动主要是依赖作者的“才能”“灵感”等等，因此，幻想着不要花费艰苦的劳动而一镢头挖出个金娃娃来，或者过分迷醉于自己的“才能”“灵感”。这是极端错误而危险的想法。许多著名作家的创作经验证明：任何一部成功的作品，都是由于作者付出了全部的心血和劳力所获得的。
    写作是一件困难重重、十分不易的事情。但，这决不是让青年们由此对写作“望而生畏”“知难而退”，恰巧相反，而是让青年们正视并拿出勇气战胜这种困难，正像斐定说的：“能够达到优秀成绩的是那些写作时感觉困难的人，而不是写作时感到容易的人。”（“论写作”207页）
    关于如何创造典型人物的形象，也是这些书一再阐述的重要问题。作家们根据自己的创作经验，一再教导青年作者：人物形象必须从生活中摄取，创造出活生生的、有血有肉的人物形象来。高尔基认为要把人写“活”，首先要“从各人物身上，发见并指出语言，行为，姿态，相貌，微笑，眼风等性格的独创的特点”，“人，无论外表或内心都有某种独特的东西”（“给青年作者”73页）。同时，他也指出，虽然作者面对的是读者，“但不可使读者听说教。对于做读者的我，只要给了优美、正确、鲜明的形象就好了；结论让我自己来下。”（“给青年作者”22页）很显然，这些教导，对于克服青年写作者在写作上普遍存在的公式化、概念化的偏向，会有很大益处。
    这些书对青年写作的指导是具体的、细致的。例如，劝告青年们先写自己熟悉的事物，先写短篇，要加强文学语言的修养，使其达到精炼、鲜明而准确，要尽量多读书，不要因微小的成就冲昏头脑，等等，都是接触到了青年写作中的具体而实际的问题。
