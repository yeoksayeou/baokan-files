After learning the joint directive of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and frugally, the Xiaoji Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, implemented a financial contract system, overcoming financial chaos and waste.

The Xiaoji Agricultural Production Cooperative is a large cooperative with more than 1,000 households. After its establishment this spring, some cadres felt that since the cooperative was large and had a lot of income, it wouldn't matter if they spent a little more, and they emphasized "show." Du Xingqi, the captain of the ninth team, bought five new fenders for the team's twelve horse-drawn carts, even though the old ones were still usable. The eighth team, seeing the ninth team buying new fenders, immediately replaced the neck protectors on their nine mules with new ones. In the people's school, a classroom with fewer than thirty people used a gas lamp. In the one-plus months since the establishment of the cooperative, more than 1,500 yuan had been spent, of which 1,000 yuan should not have been spent.

After the management committee studied the joint instruction of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and frugally, it examined the mistakes of spending money indiscriminately and emphasizing "show" in the past, and used the method of detailed accounting to explain the importance of running cooperatives diligently and frugally to some cooperative cadres and members. They specifically calculated the accounts for the members: the cooperative had more than 520 head of livestock, and if each animal used one extra inch of hide per year, it would cost 300 yuan more per year. They used such facts to educate the members to focus on small things and find more ways to save money. After being educated, the members took action. The cart drivers replaced the large oil bottles they used to use with small oil bottles. In the past, they lazily poured too much oil on the axles; now, they diligently poured less oil. When applying manure, they covered the axles. In the past, a cart used two and a half liang of oil per day, now they proposed a contract system of four qian of oil per day. The teachers and students of the fifteen people's schools replaced gas lamps with hanging lamps, assigned a person to be responsible, turned them up when needed, and turned them off after class. In the past, they used more than 180 jin of kerosene per month, now 50 jin is enough. In this way, more than 70 items of daily administrative expenses have been contracted out, reducing the annual administrative expenses from 12,200 yuan in the past to 2,800 yuan.

    学习了勤俭办社指示以后
    河南省新乡县小冀农业生产合作社实行了财务包干制，克服了财务混乱和浪费现象。
    小冀农业生产合作社是一千多户的大社，这个社今春建立后有些干部觉得社大收入多，多花点没啥，作什么事都讲“派头”。九队十二辆马车的挡全能用，队长杜兴其一下买了五付新挡，把车上还能用的旧挡换下来；八队看到九队买新挡，他们马上把九个骡子上的护脖换成新的；民校中一个课室不到三十人就点上汽灯，建社一个多月的时间就花了一千五百多元，其中有一千元是不应该化而化了的。
    管理委员会学习了中共中央、国务院关于勤俭办社的联合指示以后，检查了过去的乱花钱、讲派头的错误，并用算细账的办法向某些社干部和社员讲解勤俭办社的重要意义。他们向社员具体算了一下账：全社五百二十多头牲口，一个牲口一年多用一根寸皮，一年就得多花三百元。用这样的事实教育社员从小处着眼，多找节约门路。社员们经过教育，也都行动起来了。赶车的“大把”们，把过去的大油瓶换成小油瓶，过去车轴上是懒浇多占油，改为勤浇少占油，上粪的时候还把轴蒙上，车过去一个车每天用二两半油，现在他们提出每天四钱油就包干了。十五处民校的教员、学员们，把汽灯换成吊灯，确定专人负责，用时再捻大，下课就熄灭，过去他们每月要用一百八十多斤煤油，现在只用五十斤就够了。就这样，有七十多项日常行政用项都实行了包干，每年的行政开支由过去的一万二千二百元减少到二千八百元。（新华社）
