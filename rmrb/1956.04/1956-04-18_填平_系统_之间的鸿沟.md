    Bridging the Gap Between "Systems"
    Fang Qing
    The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is an old factory with a history of over fifty years, and the vast majority of its workers are veteran skilled workers. According to statistics from February of this year, the average grade of workers in the factory is 4.4, with workers at or above grade four accounting for 77% of the total workforce. However, this does not fully reflect the technical capabilities of the factory's workers, because there has been no skills assessment for a long time. In the six years from 1950 to 1955, 40% of the workers did not receive promotions. As a result, many grade six workers who haven't been promoted for several years are doing work that grade four workers could handle. In the passenger car workshop's painting section, the average worker grade is 4.7, while their products, on average, only require a grade 4.4 worker according to the process specifications.
    The average technical grade of skilled workers in the Qiqihar First Machine Tool Factory, Second Machine Tool Factory, Qiqihar Machinery Factory, and other five factories is 3.6. The average technical grade of workers at the Harbin Tool Factory is 3.32. These factories rarely have workers who haven't been promoted for several years. Taking the Harbin Tool Factory as an example, the average technical grade of workers was 2.71 in 1953, 2.73 in 1954, and 3.32 in 1955, and the number of new workers has been increasing every year. This shows that workers in these factories are promoted relatively quickly; however, the average technical grade of workers still often cannot meet the production needs of these factories.
    Within a region, some factories have technical grades that exceed their needs, while others cannot meet their needs. Local Party committees and government departments are well aware of this imbalance. So why not make appropriate adjustments? The reason is that because the "systems" are different, reasonable adjustments cannot be made. The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory belongs to the Ministry of Railways, while other factories belong to the First Ministry of Machine Building or are local state-owned enterprises. There is a deep, insurmountable gap between "systems." Therefore, although many people have suggested making adjustments, many people say, "Don't bother with that; it's not the same 'system,' it's difficult to handle!"
    Strengthening the collective concept and opposing departmentalism should not be limited to the issue of cooperation between departments. The issue should be extended so that all potential strengths that can be exploited—including human and material resources—should be unreservedly contributed to the development of the national construction cause. This is the true overall concept. Therefore, we hope that relevant departments will bridge the gap between "systems," rationally adjust human and material resources, and not allow some departments to have so much that they cannot use it, while others have so little that it hinders production.

    填平“系统”之间的鸿沟
    方青
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂，是一个具有五十多年历史的老工厂，绝大部分工人都是老技术工人。据今年二月份统计，全厂工人平均等级是四·四级，其中四级以上的工人占工人总数77％。但是，这还不能说明该厂工人的技术情况，因为长期不考工，从1950年到1955年的六年中，有40％的工人没升级。结果是许多已经几年没提升的六级工人做的是四级工人就可以做了的活。客车车间的油工工段，工人平均等级是四·七级，而他们的产品平均起来，按照工艺规程计算，四·四级工人就可以完成了。
    齐齐哈尔第一机床厂、第二机床厂、齐齐哈尔机械厂等五个工厂的技术工人，平均技术等级是三·六级；哈尔滨工具厂工人的平均技术等级是三·三二级。这些工厂很少有几年不提升的工人。以哈尔滨工具厂为例，1953年工人平均技术等级是二·七一级，1954年是二·七三级，1955年是三·三二级，而且这几年每年都在增加新的工人。这说明这些工厂工人提升得比较快；但是，工人平均技术等级仍然经常不能满足这些工厂的生产需要。
    在一个地区之内，有的工厂技术等级超过需要，有的则不能满足需要。这种不平衡现象，地方党委和政府部门是很清楚的。那么又为什么不作适当调整呢？原来是因为“系统”不同，就不能合理调整。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂是属铁道部的，其他厂子是第一机械工业部或者是地方国营的。“系统”之间有一条深不可越的鸿沟。所以，虽然有不少人提出要调整一下，但是，很多人都说：“不要碰那个钉子，不是一个‘系统’，不好办！”
    加强集体观念，反对本位主义，不仅仅是就部门与部门之间的协作问题，应当把问题引伸开，凡是一切可以发挥的潜在力量——包括人力、物力在内——都应当毫无保留地拿出来，以利国家建设事业的发展。这才是真正整体观念。所以，我们希望有关部门填平“系统”的鸿沟，合理地调整人力、物力，不要让有的部门多得用不了，而另一些部门少得妨碍生产。
