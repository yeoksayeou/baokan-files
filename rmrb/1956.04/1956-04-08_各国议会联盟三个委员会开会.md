    Xinhua News Agency, Dubrovnik: The joint session of the Political Committee and the Legal Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council concluded its discussion on the universality of the Inter-Parliamentary Union on the 5th.

    In the course of the discussion, almost all speakers supported the principle that the Inter-Parliamentary Union should be universal, advocating for a broader inclusion of parliamentary groups from various countries with different social and economic systems to participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. However, the delegations of twenty-three countries opposed this. The Political Committee and the Legal Committee finally decided by a majority vote that it was not prepared to submit the question of the universality of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting to be held in Bangkok, nor would it make a resolution in which the committee reaffirmed its adherence to the principle of universality.

    The Economic Committee discussed the economic development of Asian and African countries on the evening of April 4th and the 5th. The resolution passed by the committee recommends that countries with different social systems exchange economic information and experiences with each other, and use the money saved from possible reductions in military spending to finance the economic development of underdeveloped countries.

    各国议会联盟三个委员会开会
    据新华社讯　杜布罗夫尼克消息：各国议会联盟理事会政治委员会和法律委员会联席会议五日结束了讨论关于各国议会联盟的普遍性的问题。
    在讨论的过程中，几乎所有发言人都支持各国议会联盟应该具有普遍性这样一个原则，主张更广泛地吸收社会制度和经济制度不同的各个国家的议员团参加各国议会联盟。但是有二十三个国家的代表团反对，政治委员会和法律委员会终于以多数票决定，它不准备向将在曼谷举行的各国议会联盟会议提出关于各国议会联盟的普遍性的问题，也不作出委员会重申忠于普遍性原则的决议。
    经济委员会在四月四日晚间和五日，讨论了亚非国家经济发展的问题。委员会通过的决议建议社会制度不同的国家互相交换经济情报和经验，并且把由于可能裁减军备开支而节省下来的钱用来资助落后国家的经济发展。
