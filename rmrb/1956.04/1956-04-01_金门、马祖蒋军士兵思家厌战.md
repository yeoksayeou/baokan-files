Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 30th -- Chiang army soldiers Mo Weijiu and others who returned said to our reporter that the Chiang army soldiers transferred from Taiwan to Kinmen, Matsu, and other islands miss their families and are weary of war even more when they look towards the mainland.

Mo Weijiu said that the Chiang army soldiers constantly cherish the memory of their relatives on the mainland. Some Chiang army soldiers commit suicide because they miss their families and are weary of war. In one regiment where Mo Weijiu was stationed, five people committed suicide in one month. Some people often weep in secret because they miss their families. A Chiang army deputy platoon leader composed a clapper talk that said, "One person is a soldier far away, leaving behind a wife and child at home. It has been seven or eight years since leaving home, and I don't know when I can return!" This clapper talk expressed the Chiang army soldiers' feelings of missing their families, so it quickly spread among the Chiang army.

    金门、马祖蒋军士兵思家厌战
    据新华社福建前线30日电　归来的蒋军士兵莫维就等人对本社记者说，从台湾调到金门、马祖等岛的蒋军士兵，遥望大陆更加思家厌战。
    莫维就说，蒋军士兵时刻怀念着在大陆上的亲人。有些蒋军士兵因思家厌战而自杀。莫维就所在的一个团里，一个月内就有五个人自杀。有些人因思家而常常背着人痛哭。一名蒋军副排长编了一首快板说：“一人当兵在外边，家里留下妻子和娃娃，离家已有七八载，不知何日能回家！”这首快板表达了蒋军士兵思家的心情，因此很快就在蒋军中流传。
