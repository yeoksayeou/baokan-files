	The quadrennial presidential and vice-presidential election in the United States will be held on November 6th this year. At the same time, this year is also the biennial congressional election. One-third of the senators with six-year terms (32 people), all members of the House of Representatives with two-year terms (435 people), as well as the governors of thirty states, members of the legislative bodies of several states and cities, and mayors will also be re-elected.
	According to the US Constitution, presidential candidates must be nominated by political parties. Since mid-March, the two major bourgeois parties that rule the United States—the Democratic Party and the Republican Party—have held a series of "primaries" in many states to elect delegates to the two parties' national conventions for presidential candidate nominations to be held in Chicago and San Francisco in August.
	As the state primaries have begun one after another, the Democratic and Republican parties have now launched noisy election campaigns. However, American voters do not show enthusiasm for this year's election. On the contrary, they feel anxious and uneasy about the future. At present, the atmosphere of the Cold War still shrouds American political life. Millions of Americans, including many bourgeois representatives, are tired of the Cold War. Peace is the most pressing issue for the American people, and the call for the government to fulfill the promises made at the Geneva Four-Power Summit is growing. On the other hand, despite the US bourgeoisie's propaganda machine vying to tout the US economic prosperity, the cruel fact is that the agricultural crisis is deepening day by day. The artificial economic upswing caused by large-scale military production plans has shown instability, and the production of some important business sectors has been reduced, and the number of unemployed has increased, and economic instability has caused widespread concern. In recent years, the prevalence of domestic racialist terror in the United States and the intensification of fascist persecution have been answered by the increasingly unfolding struggle for the abolition of various fascist laws and the safeguarding of democratic rights. The failure of foreign policy, economic instability, and political turmoil have become the characteristics of this election year. The universal demands of the American people are peace, improved living standards, and guaranteed democratic rights. The people's desire is strong and unstoppable, making it impossible for the bourgeois politicians of the two parties participating in the election to ignore it. Peace and economic stability have become the banners of competition in the election between the two parties.
	The Democratic and Republican parties know that the guarantee of peace and improved living standards is extremely attractive to the American people. Therefore, in terms of campaign strategies, both parties are doing their best to cater to the psychology of the American people in their campaign propaganda. In 1952, the Republican Party won by promising to end the Korean War. This year, it put forward the campaign slogan of "peace and prosperity." They are trying their best to make voters believe that the Republican government's policies have brought "prosperity" to the United States, avoided war, and increased the prospect of peace. However, the Democratic Party made some revelations about the Republican Party's self-praise. Stevenson, who was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate in the last election and is preparing to try again this year, summed up the three years of the Republican government's achievements in three points: "The United States' prestige and influence in the world have declined unprecedentedly"; "The country has been on the verge of war three times without being told about it"; "American farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy, and small businesses have encountered serious difficulties." Ambitious Democratic Senator Kefauver pointed out that the Eisenhower government did not believe that peace was possible at all. Millionaire Harriman, who also has his sights set on the White House, described the Republican government as implementing a policy of "providing a huge grab bag for private privileged groups."
	In fact, as everyone knows, the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States both represent the interests of American monopoly capital. Many important domestic and foreign policies of the Republican Party are supported by the Democratic Party. There is no disagreement between the two parties on basic domestic and foreign policies. Their quarrels are nothing more than wanting to win the trust of voters in order to seize the power of the White House. Therefore, one is doing its best to whitewash the situation and brag about it, while the other, as the opposition party, believes that it is beneficial to make some revelations about the ruling Republican Party's bragging.
	Under the anti-democratic two-party system in the United States, the progressive forces in the United States are still not in a position to conduct elections independently this year, but they still have to work hard to exert and expand their influence. In January, the American Communist Party publication "Political Affairs Monthly" stated the attitude of the American progressive forces toward this year's election, saying that although in the 1956 election, American voters did not have much room for choice, this year's election is still a good opportunity to promote mass political activities. It called on all progressive and democratic forces to unite and strengthen the American people's struggle for peace, economic welfare, and the maintenance of democratic rights through this mass political activity, expand the American people's independent political action and role in the election, so as to influence the development of the election, and exert an increasingly greater influence on the government and Congress that come to power after the election.
	In order to crack down on the democratic and progressive forces in the United States and limit their influence, the US ruling group has recently launched a fascist-style attack on the American Communist Party. It was only due to the protests of domestic and international democratic forces in the United States that they had to restrain themselves slightly. However, the fascist conspiracy to stifle the democratic and progressive forces in the United States is still being actively plotted. (Lin)

### 1956年美国大选的序幕

    1956年美国大选的序幕
    今年十一月六日，美国将举行四年一度的总统和副总统选举。同时，今年又是两年一度的国会选举，任期六年的三分之一参议员（三十二人），任期二年的全体众议员（435人），此外还有三十个州的州长，若干州与市的立法机构委员和市长等也都要改选。
    根据美国的宪法，总统候选人必须由政党提名。从三月中旬起，统治着美国的两大资产阶级政党——民主党和共和党，已在许多州举行一系列的“预选”，选出参加今年八月间分别在芝加哥和旧金山召开的两党总统候选人提名的全国代表大会的代表。
    随着各州预选的陆续开始，现在民主党和共和党已展开了吵吵嚷嚷的竞选活动，但是美国选民对今年的大选并不表示热情，相反地，他们对未来的前景感到焦虑和不安。目前冷战的气氛仍然笼罩着美国的政治生活，千千万万的美国人民，甚至包括许多资产阶级代表人物在内，对冷战已感到厌倦，和平是美国人民目前最关心的问题，要求政府实现日内瓦四国首脑会议上所作诺言的呼声日益高涨。另一方面，尽管美国资产阶级的宣传机器竞相吹嘘美国经济繁荣，但无情的事实是农业危机逐日加深，由于大规模军事生产计划而造成人为的经济上升已经出现了不稳的现象，某些重要的企业部门的生产有了缩减，失业人数已有增加，经济的不稳定引起了广泛阶层的忧虑。近年来美国国内种族主义恐怖的盛行以及法西斯迫害加剧，人民的回答是日益展开了要求废除各种法西斯法案和维护民主权利的斗争。外交政策的失败、经济的不稳和政治的动荡，成为今年这个选举年的特点。美国人民的普遍要求是和平、改善生活和保障民主权利。人民的这个愿望是强烈和不可遏止的，使得参加竞选的两党资产阶级政客们都不敢置之不顾。和平和经济稳定成了两党竞选中争夺的旗帜。
    民主党和共和党都知道和平与改善生活的保证对美国人民有莫大的诱惑力，因此在竞选策略上，两党在竞选宣传上都竭力投合美国人民的这种心理。共和党在1952年就是以结束朝鲜战争的诺言取得胜利的，今年它又提出了“和平与繁荣”的竞选口号。他们竭力要使选民相信，共和党政府的政策使美国得到了“繁荣”，避免了战争，增加了和平的前景。但是民主党对共和党这种自吹自打作了一些揭露。在上届大选中曾被推为民主党总统候选人而今年准备再度一试的史蒂文森把共和党政府三年的政绩总结了三点说：“美国在世界各地威信和影响已经空前低落”；“国家曾三次濒于战争边缘而没有被告知这件事”；“美国农民已经濒于破产边缘，小商人遭到了严重困难”。野心勃勃的民主党参议员克弗维尔指出艾森豪威尔政府根本就没有相信和平是可能的。也有意于白宫位置的百万富翁哈里曼形容共和党政府执行的是“为私人特权集团提供巨大摸彩袋”的政策。
    实际上，大家知道，美国的共和民主两党都代表美国垄断资本的利益，共和党许多重要的内政和外交措施，都得到民主党的支持，两党在内外基本政策上，并没有分歧。它们争吵，不过是都想骗取选民的信任，以便把白宫的权力抓到手中。因此一个是竭力粉饰太平，大事吹嘘，另一个作为在野党，却认为对执政的共和党这种吹嘘作一些揭露是有利的。
    在美国的反民主的两党制度之下，今年美国的进步力量仍然没有条件单独进行竞选，但是他们仍然要努力发挥和扩大他们的影响。一月份美国共产党刊物“政事月刊”在表明美国进步力量对今年大选的态度时说，虽然1956年的选举，美国选民是没有多大选择余地的，但是今年的大选仍然是促进群众性政治活动的良好机会，它号召一切进步和民主的力量联合起来，通过这种群众性的政治活动来加强美国人民争取和平、经济福利和维护民主权利的斗争，扩大美国人民独立的政治行动和在选举中的作用，以影响选举的发展，并对大选后上台的政府和国会产生愈来愈大的影响。
    为了打击美国的民主和进步力量，限制他们的影响，最近美国统治集团特别对美国共产党发动了法西斯式的进攻。只是由于美国国内和国际民主力量的抗议，才使得他们不得不稍稍有所收敛。但是扼杀美国民主和进步力量的法西斯阴谋仍在积极策划中。       （林）
