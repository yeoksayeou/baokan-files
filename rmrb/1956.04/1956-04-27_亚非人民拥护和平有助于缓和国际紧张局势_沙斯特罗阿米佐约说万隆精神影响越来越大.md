Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 26th. Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said that the Bandung Conference made an important political contribution to the world and opened the way to the complete liberation that can free the world from the final shackles of colonialism. He said, I am convinced that the promising developments in the easing of tensions between the major powers that have emerged in recent months are largely due to their recognition that the larger part of the people living on our two continents are peace-loving and only peace-loving.

Sastroamidjojo made this speech at a special gathering held at the residence of Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdulgani on the evening of April 24. Diplomats from Asian and African countries who participated in the Bandung Conference last year and many Indonesian politicians attended the gathering. The gathering marked the end of the Bandung Conference's first anniversary week.

Sastroamidjojo said that a year ago, Asia and Africa celebrated their political maturity in Bandung. They did so not by making empty talk, nor by forming a new bloc of countries, nor by issuing threats to one side, or issuing ultimatums, but by clearly declaring that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil that must be eliminated as soon as possible.

The Indonesian Prime Minister added that the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Conference are intended not only as a signpost for ourselves, but also for all countries and nations in the world, pointing to a true paradise of peace and happiness.

He further said that many countries that were once waiting to be admitted to the United Nations are now members of this world organization, because the world is beginning to realize more and more clearly that it is impossible to exclude any country in order to achieve world peace. Sastroamidjojo then pointed out that there is still much to be done, including the entry of the People's Republic of China, as a great power, into the United Nations, and the admission of Japan, Mongolia, and other countries to the United Nations. He also said that Malaya is striving for independence, and Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Indonesia, which is fighting to recover its legitimate territory—West Irian—are engaged in similar struggles. In all these issues, the Bandung spirit is playing a great influence.

    亚非人民拥护和平有助于缓和国际紧张局势
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说万隆精神影响越来越大
    新华社雅加达26日电  印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，万隆会议对世界作出了重要的政治贡献，并且开辟了通向可以使世界摆脱殖民主义的最后桎梏的彻底解放的道路。他说，我确信最近几个月里所出现的大国间紧张局势有了缓和的有希望的发展，大半是因为它们认识到生活在我们两个洲的较大部分人民是拥护和平的，而且只拥护和平。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约是在四月二十四日晚在印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼的官邸举行的一次特别集会上发表这篇演说的。参加集会的有去年参加过万隆会议的亚非国家的外交官和许多印度尼西亚的政治家。这次集会标志着万隆会议一周年纪念周的结束。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，一年前，亚非两洲在万隆庆祝了它们在政治上的成熟。它们这样做的办法不是说空话，也不是成立一个新的国家集团，也不是对某一个方面发出威胁，或者提出最后通牒，而是明确地宣布，殖民主义在其各种表现中都是一种必须尽快加以消除的罪恶。
    这位印度尼西亚总理又说，万隆会议所通过的十项原则不仅仅是打算作为我们自己的、而且也是全世界一切国家和一切民族的指向真正的和平和幸福乐园的指向标。
    他进一步说，许多曾经在等待被接纳入联合国的国家现在已经是这个世界组织的成员国了，因为世界开始日益清楚地认识到，要实现世界和平就不可能排除任何国家。沙斯特罗阿米佐约接着指出，目前等待着要做的事情还很多，包括作为一个大国的中华人民共和国进入联合国和日本、蒙古以及其他国家接纳参加联合国的问题。他还说，马来亚正在争取独立，摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和正在为收回它的合法领土——西伊里安——而斗争的印度尼西亚正在进行类似的斗争。在所有这些问题上，万隆精神正在起着很大的影响。
