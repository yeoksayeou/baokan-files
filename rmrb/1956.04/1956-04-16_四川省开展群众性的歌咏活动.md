Sichuan Province Launches Mass Singing Activities

    On April 13th, Sichuan Province established a Mass Singing Movement Committee. This committee is jointly composed of thirteen units including the Sichuan Provincial Culture Bureau and the Chengdu Branch of the Chinese Musicians Association.

    This year, Sichuan Province will launch a mass singing movement. Cities above the county level throughout the province will hold large-scale mass singing activities such as mass singing performances and mass singing competitions. Counties and cities with the necessary conditions will also organize songwriting groups to create popular songs.

    Currently, cities such as Chengdu, Chongqing, and Zigong have organized many conductor training classes, new song teaching stations, singing teams, choirs, and folk orchestras. Chengdu has also established eight songwriting groups. (Xinhua News Agency)
