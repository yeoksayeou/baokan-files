Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm (via TASS) – The World Peace Council Special Meeting began its work on April 7, dividing into the Political Committee, the Economic, Social and Cultural Issues Committee, the Atomic Energy Issues Committee, and the Organizational Issues Committee.

    The Political Committee, chaired by Wen Yuzhang, decided to discuss the following three issues: disarmament issues related to the negotiations with the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee and the issue of supervising conventional armaments; the prospects for easing international tensions and resolving disputes (such as the German unification issue) presented by the reduction of armaments; and the peace movement and disarmament in the new international situation.

    Speakers at the meeting emphasized the importance of the disarmament issue and raised other issues they believed were related to disarmament, such as the situation in the Near East, the situation in Algeria, and the right of self-determination for people in dependent countries and colonies.

    American representative Chaffee spoke about the possibility of further expanding the peace movement. He pointed out that peace defenders could receive support from various organizations in the struggle for disarmament. He cited the example of the Cooperative Party in Britain, which has millions of cooperative members and recently advocated at its conference the reduction of military spending, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and trade with socialist countries.

    A letter from Professor Yoshitaro Hirano of Japan was read at the meeting, suggesting efforts to stop the testing of nuclear weapons and demanding that governments declare their abandonment of arms expansion and non-use of nuclear weapons. He also suggested that small and medium-sized countries refuse to participate in military blocs and refuse to allow foreigners to establish military bases on their territory.

    The Economic, Social and Cultural Issues Committee met under the chairmanship of Lombardi of Italy to discuss the impact of arms expansion and disarmament on people's lives, as well as the possibilities that disarmament would open up in assisting economically underdeveloped countries.

    The Atomic Energy Issues Committee began its work under the chairmanship of Professor Infeld of Poland. The committee discussed issues such as the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction; the prohibition of hydrogen bomb testing and the destruction of hydrogen bomb stockpiles; the prospects for the peaceful use of atomic energy to open up human happiness and prosperity; and the supervision of atomic armaments, etc.

    The Organizational Issues Committee elected Lafayette of France as chairman. He suggested that peace advocates in various countries exchange experiences in the struggle for disarmament and decide on the forms and methods of launching a world disarmament movement. He suggested that the committee discuss the issue of cooperation among all peace forces advocating disarmament. Hikmet of Turkey and Sereni of Italy spoke at the meeting.
