    The Face of a Rascal
    Recently, people have been very concerned about the following question: What is the United States' attitude towards the resolution of the Icelandic parliament demanding the withdrawal of American troops?
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles came out to speak. Dulles admitted that the Icelandic parliament's resolution reflected an "understandable desire." Moreover, he made a comparison that cannot be said to be unreasonable: the presence of American troops in Iceland, with a population of only 160,000, is as intolerable as "having six million foreign, non-English speaking troops stationed in the United States."
    However, despite this being "understandable" and reasonable, Dulles declared that "the resolution itself has no implementing force internationally." The United States does not intend to "take any decisive action." One cannot help but be surprised by Dulles' lawyerly eloquence. As pointed out in the Icelandic parliament's resolution, even according to the terms of the agreement, Iceland has the right to abolish the agreement.
    The United States has always brazenly claimed that the American troops stationed in foreign countries are there at the "voluntary invitation" of the host countries, but now, when others formally demand that it withdraw its troops, it shamelessly says: this demand has no "force." The reasonable wishes of the people have "no implementing force" for the American ruling clique. The terms of the agreements that the United States itself has signed also have "no implementing force" for the American ruling clique. So what do they consider to have force?
    Dulles believes that the reason why American troops cannot withdraw from Iceland is: "Danger is always present, and the struggle could erupt from the so-called Cold War into a hot war." This means that the legal force recognized by the U.S. government lies in its own interpretation of the situation. As long as it says that the danger of a hot war still exists, other countries must tolerate continuing to be American military bases, allowing American troops to run rampant there. The so-called "security of the free world" has become a major excuse for the United States to infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries. Although the international situation has greatly improved in recent years, and a good prospect for peace has emerged, even Western government leaders such as French Prime Minister Mollet have publicly stated that they have never believed in any "Soviet invasion threat," Dulles clearly believes that his responsibility is to cling to the "security interests of the free world" and use all his skills to defend this signboard. Indeed, if even this last fig leaf is lost, wouldn't the imperialist ferocity of the United States be completely exposed?
    Some American newspapers have revealed a bit of the real secret behind Washington's announcement that the Icelandic parliament's actions have "no implementing force." A message from Washington by "Christian Science Monitor" reporter Stanford pointed out that the Americans believe that Iceland's actions are dangerous because "it has the potential to trigger a chain reaction." What Washington is really worried about is that many countries currently under American military occupation will be encouraged by the bold actions of the Icelandic parliament, rise up to drive the American occupiers out of their territories, and liberate themselves from American military control. This concern of the Americans is not without basis. For many years, wherever there are American military bases, one can hear the cry of "Yankee go home." However, anyone who believes that America's blatant denial of the legitimacy of Iceland's actions will help improve its already tarnished prestige in the eyes of the people of various countries, and be able to stop the tide of people demanding the withdrawal of American troops, must be someone who has lost political realism like Dulles, or a fool.

    无赖的嘴脸
    最近人们都很关心这样一个问题：美国对于冰岛议会要求撤退美军的决议抱什么样的态度呢？
    美国国务卿杜勒斯出来说话了。杜勒斯承认冰岛议会的决议反映了一种“可以理解的愿望”。而且他还作了一个不能不说是合乎情理的比喻：美国军队驻在只有十六万人的冰岛，就如同“有六百万外国的、不说英语的军队驻在美国”一样，是难以令人容忍的。
    但是，尽管这是“可以理解的”和合乎情理的，杜勒斯却宣布说：“这个决议本身在国际上是没有实施的效力的”。美国不打算“采取任何决定性行动”。人们不能不吃惊于杜勒斯的讼师口才。像冰岛议会的决议中指出的，即使根据协定的条文，冰岛也是有权将协定废除的。
    美国一向总是厚着脸皮说美国驻在外国的军队是应驻在国的“自动邀请”的，但是现在当别人正式提出要它把军队撤走的要求的时候，它却脸皮更厚地说：这种要求没有“效力”。人民的合理愿望对美国统治集团来说是“没有实施的效力”的。美国自己签订的协定的条文对美国统治集团也“没有实施的效力”。那末究竟什么才是他们认为有效力的呢？
    杜勒斯认为美国军队不能从冰岛撤退的理由是：“危险经常存在，斗争可以从所谓冷战爆发为一个热战。”这就是说，美国政府承认的法律效力就在于它自己对形势的解释。只要它说热战的危险仍然存在，其他国家就得容忍自己继续成为美国的军事基地，让美军在那里横行霸道。所谓“自由世界的安全”已经成为美国侵犯其他国家主权的一条主要借口。尽管国际局势近年来已经大大好转，出现了和平的良好前景，尽管连法国总理摩勒这样的西方国家政府首脑也公开表示从来不相信有什么“苏联侵略威胁”存在，但是杜勒斯显然认为，他的责任就是必须咬定“自由世界安全利益”，并且运用他的全部看家本领来为这块招牌辩解。的确，如果连这最后一块遮羞布也丢掉的话，美国的帝国主义凶相不就要毕露了么？
    一些美国报刊道出了一点华盛顿方面宣布冰岛议会的行动“没有实施的效力”的真正秘密。“基督教科学箴言报”记者史坦福发自华盛顿的一则消息中指出，美国人认为冰岛的行动之所以危险，是“因为它有引起一种连锁似的反应之势”。华盛顿所真正担忧的是许多现在受着美国军事占领的国家会从冰岛议会的大胆行动得到鼓舞，都起来把美国占领者逐出他们的领土，使自己从美国的军事控制下解放出来。美国人的这种忧虑不是没有根据的，多年以来，哪里有美国的军事基地，哪里就可以听到“美国佬滚回去”的呼声。可是，谁如果相信美国蛮横地否认冰岛行动的合法性，会帮助提高它在各国人民心目中已经扫地的威信，能够阻得住各国人民要求美军撤退的浪潮，那除非是像杜勒斯这样丧失政治现实感的人或是傻瓜。　（徐）
