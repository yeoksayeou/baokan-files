    Supporting Cambodia's Peaceful Neutrality

    Recently, the Cambodian Kingdom's Sihanouk Cabinet resigned under the overbearing external interference. Before resigning from the post of Prime Minister, Prince Sihanouk told the Cambodian people that Cambodia should adhere to its neutral policy and not deviate from the path of neutrality. The Chinese people sympathize with Cambodia's situation, support Cambodia's policy of peaceful neutrality, and express indignation at the unreasonable behavior of wantonly interfering in Cambodia's affairs.

    Based on the common will of the Cambodian people, Prince Sihanouk once led the Kingdom's government in resolutely implementing a policy of peaceful neutrality and non-participation in military blocs. This policy is fully in line with the 1954 Geneva Agreement on restoring peace in Indochina. The Geneva Agreement clearly stipulates that the Indochinese countries should not participate in military blocs. The essence of the Geneva Agreement is to enable the Indochinese countries to play their role in the international family of peace in a completely independent and autonomous manner. The participants of the Geneva Conference have the obligation to respect the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the Indochinese countries, and not to interfere in their internal affairs in any way.

    However, Cambodia's policy of peaceful neutrality has been met with hostility from aggressive forces, who have exerted various pressures on Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk pointed out on March 23 that since Cambodia implemented a neutral policy and sent a delegation to visit China, Cambodia's neighbors have created difficulties for Cambodia in various aspects, such as invading Cambodia's islands at sea, sending police and troops to occupy Cambodian territory, sending aircraft to violate Cambodian airspace, and even blockading Cambodia's borders. Everyone knows who is instigating such crude interference. Prince Sihanouk made it clear in a radio address on March 29 that the United States hoped Cambodia would abandon its neutral policy.

    The Chinese people have always respected Cambodia's policy of peaceful neutrality. The friendly relations between China and Cambodia are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It is clear that the friendly relations between China and Cambodia do not exclude Cambodia's friendly relations with any other country. The joint statement issued by Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai during their visit to China clearly pointed out that China and Cambodia will continue to make every effort to promote and expand international cooperation in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the resolutions and declarations of the Asian-African Conference. The Chinese people have always advocated developing economic and cultural ties with other countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and without any conditions for special privileges. China is also prepared to develop mutually beneficial economic cooperation and cultural exchanges with Cambodia on such a basis. It is equally clear that this kind of economic cooperation and cultural exchange does not exclude Cambodia from developing the same economic cooperation and cultural exchange with any other country. If it were not for deliberately obstructing friendly international cooperation and threatening peace in Indochina, then no one would have any reason to oppose Cambodia's policy of peaceful neutrality.

    The United States' crude interference in Cambodia's policy of peaceful neutrality is a serious violation of the Geneva Agreement. All peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples cannot but severely condemn such unreasonable and barbaric behavior. We firmly believe that the Cambodian people, in their struggle to uphold a policy of peaceful neutrality and defend the independence of their motherland, will inevitably receive the support of the broad masses of people around the world.

### 支持柬埔寨的和平中立

    支持柬埔寨的和平中立
    最近，柬埔寨王国西哈努克内阁在横暴的外来干涉之下宣布辞职。西哈努克亲王在辞去首相的职务前，告诉柬埔寨人民说，柬埔寨应该坚持中立政策，不要跑出中立道路之外。中国人民同情柬埔寨的处境，支持柬埔寨的和平中立政策，并对横暴干涉柬埔寨事务的无理行为表示愤慨。
    西哈努克亲王根据柬埔寨人民的共同意志，曾经领导王国政府，坚决地执行了和平中立和不参加军事集团的政策。这个政策是完全符合于1954年关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议的。日内瓦协议明确规定印度支那各国不参加军事集团。日内瓦协议的要旨就是要使印度支那各国能够完全独立自主地在国际的和平大家庭中起它们的作用。日内瓦会议的与会各国有义务尊重印度支那各国的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，并且对它们的内政不予任何干涉。
    但是，柬埔寨的和平中立政策却遭到了侵略势力的仇视，他们对柬埔寨施用了种种压力。西哈努克亲王在三月二十三日指出，自从柬埔寨执行中立政策和派遣代表团访问中国以后，柬埔寨的邻国就在各方面给柬埔寨制造困难，如侵犯柬埔寨海上的岛屿，派警察和军队占领柬埔寨的领土，派飞机侵犯柬埔寨的领空，而且还封锁了柬埔寨的边境。谁都知道，策动这种粗暴干涉行为的是什么人。西哈努克亲王在三月二十九日的广播演说中明白指出，美国希望柬埔寨放弃中立政策。
    中国人民一贯尊重柬埔寨和平中立政策。中柬两国的友好关系是建立在和平共处的五项原则的基础之上的。很清楚，中柬两国的友好关系决不排斥柬埔寨同任何其他国家的友好关系。西哈努克亲王在访问中国期间同周恩来总理联合发表的声明中就曾经明确指出，中柬两国将根据和平共处的五项原则，根据亚非会议决议和宣言的精神，继续为促进和扩大国际合作而作一切努力。中国人民一贯主张，在平等互利和不附带任何特权条件的基础上，同其他国家开展经济和文化方面的联系。中国也准备在这样的基础上，同柬埔寨发展经济方面的互助合作和文化交流。同样清楚的是这种经济合作和文化交流也决不排斥柬埔寨同任何其他国家发展同样的经济合作和文化交流。如果不是蓄意阻挠国际间的友好合作和威胁印度支那的和平，那么，任何人都没有任何理由反对柬埔寨的和平中立政策。
    美国对于柬埔寨的和平中立政策的粗暴干涉是严重违反日内瓦协议的行为。一切爱好和平、主持正义的国家和人民，不能不对这种蛮横无理的行为进行严厉的谴责。我们深信，柬埔寨人民在坚持和平中立政策和保卫祖国独立的斗争中，将必然会得到世界广大人民的支持。
