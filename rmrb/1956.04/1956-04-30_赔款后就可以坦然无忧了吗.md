Title: Can One Be Carefree After Paying Compensation?

To the Editor:

Last May, the Kailuan Coal Mine paid a sum of compensation to the Qixin Cement Plant. This was because the ash content of the coal supplied by the Kailuan Coal Mine to the Qixin Cement Plant in the first quarter of last year was too high and did not meet the quality standards. A year has passed, and the quality of the coal supplied by the Kailuan Coal Mine has not improved. Recently, the Qixin Cement Plant calculated the accounts and found that the Kailuan Coal Mine would have to pay them another 7,200 yuan in compensation for the first quarter of this year.

Since January of this year, the quality of the coal supplied by the Kailuan Coal Mine to the Qixin Cement Plant has been getting worse and worse. Of the 12,000 tons of coal supplied in January, 45% exceeded the ash content standard; in March, 65% of the coal supplied exceeded the prescribed ash content standard. According to the Qixin Cement Plant's laboratory analysis, the ash content of the coal reached more than 40% at its highest (the prescribed ash content standard is 25% to 28%), and some of the coal was as wet as coal slurry.

Although the Qixin Cement Plant receives this "windfall" every year, the losses they suffer due to the poor quality of coal far exceed the amount of compensation. They mix raw materials according to the prescribed ash content of the coal, but the ash content of the coal fluctuates, which affects the quality of the cement. Because the ash content of the coal is too high (of course, there are some other reasons), they burned the equivalent of more than 17,700 yuan of Renminbi more coal in the first quarter than planned.

However, the Kailuan Coal Mine seems to feel "carefree" about the poor coal quality because it has already paid compensation. Otherwise, why has the quality of the coal not improved at all after they paid the compensation? They should know that what users need is not compensation, but high-quality coal.

### 赔款后就可以坦然无忧了吗

    赔款后就可以坦然无忧了吗编辑同志：
    去年五月份，开滦煤矿付给启新水泥厂一笔赔款。这是因为，开滦煤矿去年第一季度供应启新水泥厂的煤灰分过高，不合质量指标的规定。一年过去了，开滦煤矿供应的煤质量还是没有好转。最近，启新水泥厂算了一下账，今年第一季度开滦煤矿又得给他们付七千二百多元的赔款。
    今年一月份以来，开滦煤矿供应启新水泥厂的煤质量越来越坏了。一月份供应的一万二千吨煤中，有45％超过灰分规定指标；三月份供应的煤炭就有65％超过了规定的灰分指标。据启新水泥厂化验室化验，煤的灰分最高达到40％以上（规定的灰分指标是25％到28％），并且有的煤还湿得像煤泥一样。
    启新水泥厂虽然每年都接受这笔“意外之财”，但是他们由于用煤质量不好而受的损失却远远超过赔款的数目。他们按照规定的煤的灰分来配合生料，煤的灰分忽高忽低，就影响了水泥的质量。因为煤的灰分过高（当然，还有一些其他的原因），他们在第一季度比计划多烧的煤就折合人民币一万七千七百多元。
    但是，开滦煤矿似乎因为已经付了赔款而对煤质不好的现象感到“坦然无忧”了。否则，在他们赔款以后，为什么煤的质量一直不见改善呢？他们应该知道：用户需要的不是赔款，而是质量很好的煤。
