    Do Not Too Frequently Transfer the Work of Technical Personnel

    To the Editor:
    I am a civil engineer. After Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals was published, I was very excited. After careful consideration, I formulated my own twelve-year plan and began to implement it.
    However, recently something happened that made me feel very distressed and almost shook my confidence in marching towards science. To explain this issue, I would like to talk about my experiences from the beginning.
    After graduating from school, I have been doing technical work in the highway department. In 1952, the leaders of the former Shanxi Provincial Transportation Bureau wanted me to change my profession and become the office director of the engineering department. Later, I offered my opinions and was transferred to be the head of the planning department. After more than a year, I finally returned to my professional work, first as an engineer in the technical department, and later as the head of the design department. During this period, I studied the regulations and methods for highway surveying and design. However, the Shanxi Provincial Personnel Bureau suddenly transferred me to Datong Coal Mine School to be the vice principal. After I expressed my opinion, I was transferred to my current work unit—the Datong Urban Planning Committee. Here, I learned from scratch how to do urban planning work, and recently I have also taken on some road design work. But recently, the director of the Urban Planning Committee told me that the leaders are going to transfer me to the Public Utilities Bureau to take on administrative duties again!
    In the past few years, the leadership has transferred my work one after another, and even repeatedly asked me to do administrative work. This is an unreasonable way of using technical talents. And now, after Premier Zhou made a report on the issue of intellectuals, they still have not changed this practice, which is very wrong. I hope the leadership can carefully consider my work issues, and no longer treat technical personnel as soccer balls on the sports field, kicking them here and there!          Dong Daxin

### 不要过于频繁地调动技术人员的工作

    不要过于频繁地调动技术人员的工作编辑同志：
    我是一个土木工程师。周总理关于知识分子问题的报告发表以后，我感到非常兴奋。经过仔细考虑以后，我订出了自己的十二年的规划，并且开始执行。
    但是最近发生了一件事情，使我感到很苦恼，几乎使我向科学进军的信心发生了动摇。要说明这个问题，我想把我的经历从头谈一下。
    我从学校毕业以后，就一直在公路部门作技术工作。1952年，原山西省交通局的领导同志要我改行，去作工程处的办公室主任。后来我提出了意见，又被调去作计划科科长。经过一年多的时间，我总算又担任了本行工作，先到技术室任工程师，后来又任设计科科长。在这期间，我研究了公路测量设计的规程方法。可是，山西省人事局突然又把我调到大同煤矿学校去当副校长了。经我提出意见后，才把我调到了现在的工作部门——大同城市规划委员会。在这里，我从头学习了如何作城市规划的工作，最近又担任了一部分道路设计工作。但是最近，城市规划委员会主任告诉我，领导方面又将要把我调到公用事业管理局去担任行政职务了！
    几年以来，领导方面接二连三地调动我的工作，甚至几次要叫我做行政工作，这是使用技术人才的一种不合理做法。而现在当周总理作了关于知识分子问题的报告以后，他们仍然没有改变这种做法，这是很不应该的。我希望领导方面能够慎重地考虑我的工作问题，不要再把技术人员当成运动场上的足球一样，一会踢到这里，一会又踢到那里！          董大新
