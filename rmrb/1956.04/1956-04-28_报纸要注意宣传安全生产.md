    Newspapers Should Pay Attention to Promoting Safe Production
    Xu Feng
    Safe production is a consistent policy of the Party and the People's Government, and also an important principle of socialist enterprise management. Since the beginning of this year, safety accidents in some factories, mines, and some transportation departments have increased compared to the past. Therefore, our newspapers should pay more attention to promoting safe production. Recently, the following newspapers have paid attention to the promotion of this issue to varying degrees.
    The Tianjin Daily focused on criticizing the mistakes of some enterprises that neglect safe production. In February and March, this newspaper successively exposed the fact that the Nancang Station of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the joint state-private venture Zhongcheng Industrial Cooperative, and the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory and other units disregarded production safety and did not pay attention to labor protection, resulting in continuous accidents. The newspaper also published an editorial calling on enterprise leaders to conduct safety inspections in conjunction with the labor competition, and vigorously strengthen labor protection work. The Liaoning Daily also promptly raised the issue of safe production. In an editorial on March 17 entitled "Earnestly Ensure Safe Production," it pointed out the fact that safety accidents in some enterprises have recently increased. The editorial pointed out that the increase in safety accidents is because the leaders of some enterprises lead production by leading shock campaigns, understanding breaking conventions as negating everything, blindly supporting some practices that violate correct procedures and systems without careful identification, and at the same time failing to adapt to the new situation of industrial production to strengthen safety measures accordingly. The newspaper reminded enterprise leaders that in the high tide of the labor competition, safety work must keep up. The Beijing Worker's Daily, on the other hand, aroused people's attention to this issue by commending advanced units and advanced individuals in safe production. On March 7, this newspaper published a proposal from labor protection and welfare staff of some factories in Nanjing to do a good job in labor protection and welfare work and ensure safe production. On March 28, on the front page, under the headline "Always Pay Attention to Safe Production," it commended the copper smelting group of Wang Jiubo of the state-owned Shanghai Smelting Plant and the deeds of other units that had not had accidents for a long time, and introduced the experience of the Chengdu Plywood Factory in establishing a "safety duty system" to avoid many accidents. In an article on March 15, the newspaper praised Yang Chunlu, an old worker at Sujiatun Station who had not had an accident for many years, and introduced his experience as a labor protection committee member of the trade union.
    It is very necessary for the above-mentioned newspapers to pay attention to the promotion of safe production and to raise the issue in a timely manner. In particular, the Beijing Worker's Daily focuses on commending advanced units and advanced individuals, and introduces advanced examples of safe production, which can better give play to the enthusiasm of enterprise cadres and workers in this regard. Of course, these newspapers still have shortcomings in promoting safe production. For example, the Liaoning Daily rarely introduces advanced units and advanced individuals in safe production, and the exposure and criticism of accidents caused by the neglect of safety work in some enterprises does not mention the due principles; the Beijing Worker's Daily has not promptly conducted vigorous criticism of the problems existing in safe production.
    With the deepening of the socialist competition, newspapers should pay close attention to the situation of safe production, use vivid and typical examples to introduce advanced experience in this area, in order to promote positive factors in safe production. At the same time, the causes of safety accidents should be thoroughly exposed. For example, illegal overtime work and blindly breaking conventions by some enterprises that cause adverse phenomena of safety accidents must be vigorously combatted. In addition, newspapers should also pay attention to conducting safety production education for workers, especially new workers, in popular ways.

    报纸要注意宣传安全生产
    徐风
    安全生产是党和人民政府的一贯方针，也是社会主义企业管理的一项重要原则。今年以来，某些厂矿企业和某些交通运输部门的安全事故较前有所增加。因此，我们的报纸，更要注意宣传安全生产的问题。最近一个时期，以下几个报纸在不同的程度上注意了这一问题的宣传。
    天津日报着重地批判了某些企业忽视安全生产的错误。这个报纸在二月和三月间先后揭露了天津铁路分局南仓站、公私合营众城工业社和国营天津第三棉纺织厂等单位漠视生产安全，不注意劳动保护，以致连续发生事故的事实。报纸还发表社论，要求企业领导人员结合劳动竞赛开展安全检查，大力加强劳动保护工作。辽宁日报也及时提出了安全生产的问题。它在三月十七日的一篇题为“切实保证安全生产”的社论中，指出了最近有些企业安全事故增多的事实。社论指出了安全事故的增多，是因为某些企业的领导人员以领导突击运动的方式来领导生产，把打破常规理解成否定一切，不加认真鉴定就盲目地支持一些违反正确规程制度的做法，同时没有适应工业生产的新形势来相应地加强安全措施。报纸提醒企业领导者，在劳动竞赛的高潮中，必须使安全工作跟上去。北京工人日报则通过对安全生产的先进单位和先进人物的表扬，来引起人们对这个问题的重视。这个报纸在三月七日发表了南京部分工厂劳保福利工作人员提出的做好劳保福利工作、保证安全生产的倡议，又在三月二十八日的第一版中，在“时刻注意安全生产”的大标题下，表扬了国营上海冶炼厂王九伯炼铜小组和其他一些单位长期不出事故的事迹，介绍了成都胶合板厂建立“安全值日制度”，避免了很多事故的经验。在三月十五日的一篇文章中，这个报纸表扬了多年没有发生事故的苏家屯车站老工人杨春禄，并且介绍了他当工会劳动保护委员的经验。
    上面几个报纸注意了安全生产的宣传，及时提出了这一方面的问题，是很有必要的。特别是北京工人日报着重地表扬了先进单位和先进人物，介绍了安全生产的先进事例，这就可以更好地发挥企业干部和工人群众在这一方面的积极性。当然，这些报纸宣传安全生产还有不够的地方，例如辽宁日报对于安全生产的先进单位和先进人物很少介绍，对于某些企业忽视安全工作造成事故的揭露和批判，没有提到应有的原则高度；北京工人日报对于安全生产中存在的问题，也没有及时进行有力的批判。
    随着社会主义竞赛的深入开展，报纸应当密切注意安全生产的情况，运用生动典型的事例，介绍这一方面的先进经验，以发扬安全生产方面的积极因素。同时，对于造成安全事故的原因应当进行深入的揭露，例如对于某些企业非法加班加点、盲目打破常规而引起安全事故的不良现象，就必须进行有力的斗争。另外，报纸也要注意以通俗的方式对工人、特别是对新工人进行安全生产的教育。
