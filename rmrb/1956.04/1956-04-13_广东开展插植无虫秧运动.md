To eliminate rice stem borers, the most damaging pest to rice, before transplanting seedlings, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is concentrating its efforts on leading farmers in a campaign to plant seedlings free of pests. Currently, 58 counties have adopted methods such as mobile pest exhibitions, pest control experience reports, and calculating the damage caused by pests to mobilize the masses to carry out pest control work. In Boluo County, more than 11,000 people have been mobilized to go to the fields to eliminate pests in the past three days. In Zijin and Zhongshan counties, after the "test borer command lights" are lit at night, thousands of households light up their lamps to kill borers. In the Chao-Shan Plain, more than 80% of the rice paddies have been sprayed with pesticides, had their seedling heads dipped in pesticide, and had moths and egg masses manually captured before transplanting, basically achieving the requirement of planting seedlings free of pests. To cooperate with the pest control campaign, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has transferred enough pesticides for two applications on more than 3 million mu of rice paddies throughout the province since early April, as well as a large number of sprayers and dusters, and is shipping them continuously to meet the needs of various localities.

    广东开展插植无虫秧运动
    广东省为了在插秧前消灭为害水稻最大的三化螟虫，中共广东省委正集中力量领导农民开展插植无虫秧运动。现在已经有五十八个县采用虫害巡回展览、除虫经验报告会、算虫害账等方式发动群众进行除虫工作。博罗县三天来出动了一万一千多人下田除虫，紫金、中山等县在晚上燃起测螟指挥灯后，万家灯火一齐点亮灭螟。潮汕平原有80％以上的秧田在插秧前都经过喷药，蘸秧头和人工扑蛾采卵，基本上达到了插植无虫秧的要求。省供销合作社为配合除虫运动，于四月初调运足够全省三百多万亩秧田施用两次的药剂和大批喷雾、喷粉器源源启运供应各地需要。　（李少球）
