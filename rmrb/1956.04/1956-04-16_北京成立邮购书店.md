    Beijing Establishes Mail-Order Bookstore
    The Beijing Mail-Order Bookstore, located on Wangfujing Street, Beijing, was established on the 15th. On the 16th, it will send more than 620 packages of books to readers in remote areas such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Heilongjiang. Before its establishment, the bookstore had already informed more than 2,000 readers across the country that they could write to purchase Chinese and foreign books that are not available locally.
    The Beijing Mail-Order Bookstore was reorganized from the original mail-order agency of the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch. It has already established mail-order book relationships with more than 7,000 readers across the country. Currently, it answers more than 200 letters from out-of-town readers every day and sends more than 500 packages of books to readers. The readers of these mail-order books are all over the country.

    北京成立邮购书店
    设在北京市王府井大街的北京邮购书店十五日成立了。十六日，它就要给遥远的西藏、新疆和黑龙江等地读者发去六百二十多包图书。这个书店在成立前已经函告全国两千多读者，可以写信来购买当地没有的中外文图书。
    北京邮购书店是由原有的新华书店北京分店邮购代办科改组的。它已经和各地七千多户读者建立了邮购图书的来往关系。现在平均每天答复外埠读者购书的信件二百多封，同时给读者发去五百多包图书。这些邮购图书的读者遍及全国。（据新华社讯）
