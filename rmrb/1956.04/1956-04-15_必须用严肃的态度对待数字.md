We Must Treat Numbers with a Serious Attitude
By the People's Daily Commentator

In order to illustrate the grand plans and achievements of China's socialist construction, newspapers frequently publish exciting figures. For example, the "First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," the "National Agricultural Development Program," and the annual national economic construction communiqués, etc., all list figures that have played a significant role in helping the broad masses understand China's current situation, showing the people of the country the great future of the nation, and inspiring the labor enthusiasm of the masses.

However, not every number has the above effect. Serious shortcomings and errors still exist in our numerical propaganda, which hinders us from more accurately reflecting the reality of our country. Newspapers often report on certain enterprises completing or exceeding their production plans. These reports undoubtedly reflect certain achievements in China's construction and production. However, these reports often only refer to the completion of the output value plan, and do not mean that the quality and other indicators have also been fully completed. This number is not enough to explain the overall situation of production. Newspapers also often publish the long-term plans for some of our country's work, proposing different numerical indicators in the plans. In order to set a direction for struggle, it is entirely necessary to put forward some indicators. However, since most of these plans will only be fully realized after several years or more than a decade, there are many unpredictable changes in the long years. These numbers are hard to say are very accurate. Publishing all these numbers in the newspaper is often unnecessary and cannot play a role in inspiring and mobilizing the masses. As for some numbers that are obviously exaggerated or purely false, if they are published rashly without examination, they will produce adverse effects and extremely bad consequences.

Why do newspapers frequently publish some incomplete, inaccurate, or fundamentally wrong numbers? In addition to the unscientific calculation methods of the publishing units, the main reason is that the editors and reporters of the newspaper lack the down-to-earth and honest work style and the scientific and meticulous analytical ability. Moreover, the leading comrades of the newspaper have not regularly conducted education to make all the editorial staff pay serious attention to the issue of numbers, so that everyone recognizes that publishing numbers is a very serious matter. The accuracy of the numbers is not only related to the credibility of the newspaper among the masses, but also to the influence of the Party and the government among the masses. As a result, some comrades blindly like large numbers and despise small numbers, always feeling that the smaller the number, the less value it has, and the more the number, the more meaningful it is. They blindly pursue new numbers that have not been published before, and despise old numbers that have already been published, thinking that frequently publishing some new numbers can get ahead of the trend and "enrich" the content of their news or articles. Thus, today the number is in hand, and tomorrow they will issue a "report" or "prediction" to the readers. This thinking of seeking more and faster prevents us from calmly verifying and analyzing the numbers we want to publish, often creating confusion in the numbers and damaging the credibility of the newspaper.

The People's Daily has also made many mistakes in the use of numbers in the past, and until recently, this error has not been eradicated from our newspaper. For example, we used to promote that the value created by each worker in state-owned enterprises was an average of 10,000 yuan per year, of which 94 percent was directly created wealth for the state, excluding wages. This figure was widely cited in various places during the promotion of the general line. In fact, this statement is completely unreasonable, because this 10,000 yuan includes the cost of raw materials and machine depreciation, etc., which cannot be included in the wealth created by a worker in one year. Another example is that on March 23 this year, a message was published on the front page that it is estimated that by 1967, the national average edible meat per person per year will be more than 80 kilograms. This was also unnecessary to publish, because it is difficult to be completely accurate to estimate things ten years later. Another example is that in an article on March 7, 53 boiler-tractor units were said to be 530,000 units; in the explanation of the pictorial on March 25, a five-horsepower boiler-tractor unit was said to be a five-hundred-horsepower boiler-tractor unit. This error is very serious. These errors all show that we lack scientific and meticulous analysis on the issue of numbers, lack a down-to-earth and realistic work style, and also lack a strict inspection system. We must deeply accept these lessons and thoroughly overcome the chaotic phenomenon in numerical propaganda.

In order to overcome the chaotic phenomenon in the publication of numbers in newspapers and all news agencies, the editorial departments of newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and publishing houses should conduct an in-depth inspection of the problems existing in this area, and propose ways to overcome this chaotic phenomenon. All units that publish numbers should also cooperate with the newspaper from all aspects to do this work well. Here, there are several principles that should be followed. First: The specific content of various numbers should be clearly defined. For example, the calculation of completing the annual plan, quarterly plan, and monthly plan must include the production level, output plan, and quality standards, otherwise it cannot be called fully completing the plan. Second: A system for checking and proofreading numbers should be established. All numbers published in the newspaper must be verified in detail and accurately with the relevant departments. Relevant national control numbers must be submitted to the relevant highest leading departments for review. Third: Once an error is found in the numbers in the newspaper, it must be corrected. Only by implementing the above principles can we establish a serious work style and make the newspaper more credible among the masses.

We hope that Party committees, government departments, and the broad masses of readers in various places will regularly supervise and help us to quickly overcome the errors and chaotic phenomena in the use of numbers in newspapers.

    必须用严肃的态度对待数字
    本报评论员
    为了说明我国社会主义建设的宏大计划和已经取得的成就，报纸上经常公布一些激动人心的数字。例如：“发展国民经济的第一个五年计划”、“全国农业发展纲要”，每个年度的国家经济建设公报等等，其中列举的数字，在帮助广大群众了解我国当前状况、给全国人民展示出国家的远大前途、和鼓舞群众的劳动热情等等方面，都曾起了很大的作用。
    但是，并非任何一个数字都有以上的作用。我们在数字宣传中还存在严重的缺点和错误，这就妨碍了我们更准确地反映我们国家的现实。在报纸上常有某些企业完成或超额完成了生产计划的报道，这些报道无疑地反映了我国建设和生产方面的一定的成就。但是这些报道往往只是指的完成了产值计划，并不意味着同时也全面地完成了质量和其它指标的计划。这个数字就不足以说明生产的全面的情况。报纸上也常常公布我们国家的某些工作的远景规划，在规划中提出了不同的数字指标。为了规定一个奋斗的方向，提出一些指标是完全必要的。但是由于这种规划大多是要几年或十几年以后才能全部实现，在漫长的岁月里，各种不可估计的变动很多，这些数字很难说是十分准确的。把这些数字全都在报纸上公布，往往是没有必要、也不能起到鼓舞和动员群众的作用的。至于有些显然是夸大了的或纯属虚假的数字，如果不加审查，冒失地刊登出来，更会产生不良的影响和极坏的恶果。
    为什么报纸上经常出现一些不全面、不准确或根本错误的数字呢？除了由于公布单位计算方法不科学的原因外，主要是报社的编辑和记者缺乏实事求是的老老实实的工作作风和科学的细致的分析能力。而报社的领导同志也没有经常进行教育，使全编辑部人员都认真地重视数字问题，使大家认识到发表数字是一个十分严肃的事，数字的准确与否，不仅关系到报纸在群众中的威信，也关系到党和政府在群众中的影响。结果是有些同志盲目地喜欢大数字、轻视小数字，总觉得数字越少越没价值，数字越多越有意义。一味地追求未曾发表过的新数字，轻视已经发表过的旧数字，以为经常刊登一些新的数字，就可以得风气之先，“充实”自己的新闻或文章的内容。于是，今天数字到手，明天就向读者发出了“报告”或“预言”。这种求多、求快的思想，使我们不能冷静地核对和分析我们所要发表的数字，往往在数字上制造了混乱，损害了报纸的威信。
    人民日报过去在使用数字方面也曾经犯过不少的错误，直至最近这种错误还没有在我们报面上根除。例如我们过去曾经宣传过每个国营企业的工人每年创造的价值平均为一万元，其中除去工资，有百分之九十四都是直接给国家创造的财富，这个数字，各地在宣传总路线的时候曾经广泛引用。其实这种说法是完全不合理的。因为这一万元里，包括原材料和机器折旧等等费用，这些都不能计入一个工人一年所创造的财富之中。又如今年三月二十三日，在第一版曾经发表了一条预计到1967年全国每人每年平均可食肉八十多斤的消息，这也是没有公布的必要的，因为现在来估计十年以后的事，很难做到完全准确。再如三月七日的一篇文章中，把五十三台锅驼机说成了五十三万台；三月二十五日的画刊说明中，把五马力的锅驼机说成了五百马力的锅驼机。这种错误是十分严重的。这些错误，都说明我们在数字问题上缺乏科学的细密的分析，缺乏老老实实、实事求是的工作作风，也缺乏严密的检查制度。我们必须深刻地接受这些教训，彻底克服在数字宣传上的混乱现象。
    为了克服报纸上及所有新闻机关发表数字的混乱现象，报社、通讯社、广播电台和出版社的编辑部都应该深入地检查一次在这方面存在的问题，并提出克服这种混乱现象的办法。一切发布数字的单位，也应该从各方面配合报纸作好这一工作。这里，有几项原则是应该遵守的。第一：应该明确规定各种数字的具体内容，例如完成年度计划、季度计划和月计划的计算，必须包括生产水平、产量计划和质量标准，否则不能叫作完全完成计划。第二：应该建立数字的检查和校对制度，报纸发表的一切数字，必须和有关部门进行详细和精确的核对，有关全国性的控制数字，必须送有关的最高领导部门审核。第三：报纸上的数字一经发现有错误以后，一定要加以更正。只有贯彻以上原则，才能树立严肃的工作作风，才能使报纸在群众中更加有威信。
    我们希望各地党委、政府各部门以及广大读者，经常监督和帮助我们，迅速克服报纸上数字使用中的错误和混乱现象。
