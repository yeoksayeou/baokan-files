    The Soviet people, who were the first to build socialism in history, have clearly pointed out to the people of all countries the path to happiness and progress. The great achievements of the Soviet Union and the grand prospects of further powerful upsurge in the economy, science, culture, and material welfare of the working people revealed by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, inspire the people of all countries to fight for peace and national independence, and for the victory of a new social system.
    The Soviet Union held its 20th Congress during a period of strong upsurge in the national economy. The successful completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan clearly and definitively proves this.
    Let us talk about the main sector of the national economy - industry. According to the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the output of industrial products was to increase by 70%. In fact, production increased by 85%. Industry completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in four years and four months. In 1955, the industrial production level exceeded that of the pre-war year of 1940 by 2.2 times. At the same time, the production of means of production increased by 91% in five years, while the Five-Year Plan stipulated 80%.
    The Communist Party, following Lenin's doctrine on building communism, has always concentrated the efforts of the Soviet people on prioritizing and accelerating the development of heavy industry. The Soviet Union's production situation in 1955 was as follows: 33 million tons of pig iron, 74% more than in 1950; 45 million tons of steel, 66% more than in 1950; 35 million tons of steel products, 69% more than five years ago; 391 million tons of coal, 50% more than in 1950; production of 163,000 tractors, etc. The products of the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries increased by 1.2 times in 1955 compared to 1950, and 3.7 times compared to 1940. Electrification is the most important prerequisite for creating the material and technical foundation of communism. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, many large hydroelectric power stations began to generate electricity. The first units of the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station supplied electricity. In 1954, the world's first atomic power station was put into production in the Soviet Union. In 1955, the Soviet Union produced 170 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 2.5 times more than in 1940. The Soviet Union ranks second in the world in electricity production.
    The rapid growth of heavy industry guarantees the continuous expansion of production in all sectors of the national economy on the basis of advanced technology. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, industrial production adopted automatic devices, remote control devices, and other latest achievements in science and technology. Great work has been done in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy.
    The continuous and planned adoption of new and latest technologies in the national economy is an inevitable condition for the further development of socialist production.
    The nationwide socialist emulation campaign launched for the adoption of new technologies and for the improvement of labor productivity is clear evidence of the Soviet people's concern for technological progress. In 1955 alone, workers, engineers, and technicians provided approximately one million inventions, improvements, and rationalization proposals. The creative initiative of the working people is an inexhaustible source of technological progress in all sectors of the Soviet national economy.
    Due to the rapid growth of heavy industry and the adoption of advanced technology, the mechanization in all sectors of the national economy is increasing on a large scale year by year. Labor productivity is improving, and product costs are decreasing. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the labor productivity of workers increased by 44% in industry and 45% in construction engineering. In the post-war years, labor productivity in industry has almost increased by 1.3 times.
    The power of each country is determined less by the achievements of the production level than by the speed of the production level growth. The socialist system has opened up an infinitely broad field for the development of productive forces. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people, taking advantage of the great superiority of the socialist economic system, have achieved a continuous and planned upsurge in industrial production at a speed never seen in world history. It is enough to mention the following: from 1927 to 1940, Soviet products increased by an average of 18.6% per year, while in the same period, the United States increased by an average of only 2% per year; from 1948 to 1955, Soviet industry increased by 16.6% per year, while U.S. industry increased by only 4.1% overall. Moreover, the growth of industry in the United States and other capitalist countries is unbalanced, and the economy of the entire capitalist world is even more unstable.
    It is important to emphasize this fact in the economic competition between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy: the absolute increase in the production of the most important products of Soviet heavy industry also exceeds that of the major capitalist countries. Take metal as an example. In the most recent five years, the United States' pig iron production increased by 10.6 million tons, the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany combined increased by 13 million tons, while the Soviet Union increased by 14 million tons during this period. Steel production in the United States increased by 17 million tons, the above three European countries increased by 16.7 million tons, while the Soviet Union increased by almost 18 million tons.
    In the Soviet Union, the prioritized growth of heavy industry is not an end in itself. The purpose of socialist production is to meet the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the Soviet people. The production of consumer goods has greatly increased precisely on the basis of the prioritized development of heavy industry in the Fifth Five-Year Plan. In 1955, the production of consumer goods increased by 76% compared to 1950, while the Fifth Five-Year Plan originally planned for an increase of 65%. In 1955, the Soviet Union produced 51% more cotton fabrics than in 1950, 62% more woolen fabrics, 59% more animal oil, 68% more meat, etc.
    The socialist economy develops on the basis of expanded reproduction. The continuous growth of basic construction is a clear sign of this development. The investment in the Fourth Five-Year Plan period was 311 billion rubles, while in the Fifth Five-Year Plan it was 594 billion rubles. In 1955 alone, more than 800 large new factories equipped with the latest technology were put into production.
    On the basis of socialist industrialization, the Soviet Union had already established a huge, world's most mechanized, collectivized agriculture during the years of the pre-war Five-Year Plans. Now, the Soviet Union has more than 90,000 collective farms, 9,000 machine tractor stations, and about 9,000 state farms. The machine tractor stations alone had 1.075 million tractors (calculated in 15 horsepower units), more than 350,000 grain combines, and a large number of other agricultural machines by the beginning of 1955. The problem of mechanizing the most important work of field farming in collective farms has been solved. This is a great victory for the Soviet people. The collective farm system guarantees a great improvement in agricultural labor productivity, increases the commodity rate, and improves the welfare of collective farm members.
    In the most recent two years, the issue of improving agriculture has been the constant focus of attention of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. A plan for the dramatic upsurge of socialist agriculture has been formulated and practically implemented.
    Among the measures for the agricultural upsurge, the following should be mentioned: In order to provide greater material incentives to collective farms and collective farm members, the purchase and procurement prices of agricultural products were increased, the mechanization of agriculture and the production of mineral fertilizers were expanded, and skilled personnel, agronomists, and machine operators were dispatched to work in machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms. For example, 29,000 engineers and technicians were dispatched from industry to machine tractor stations.
    Due to the implementation of many of the above-mentioned measures, in 1955, agricultural products increased compared to 1954. For example, grain increased by 22%, sunflower increased by 95%, and sugar beet increased by 54%.
    In the most recent two years, collective farms and state farms have reclaimed 33 million hectares of virgin and fallow land. This remarkable victory of the Soviet people in the struggle for a dramatic upsurge in agriculture was achieved due to the rapid upsurge of heavy industry, the arming of agriculture with advanced technology, and the selfless labor of the Soviet people.
    The growth of production in all sectors of the national economy is the source of the continuous improvement of the material welfare of the Soviet people. The comprehensive sign of this is the increase in national income. The national income of the Soviet Union is entirely used for the benefit of the people. The vast majority of the national income - three-quarters - is used for people's consumption. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 68%. The real wages of workers and staff increased by 39%, while the real income of farmers increased by 50%.
    The large increase in housing construction, the expansion of retail commodity circulation, and the growth of residents' savings bank deposits during the Fifth Five-Year Plan are clear signs of the continuous improvement of the material welfare of the working people.
    In 1955, the commodities sold to residents by state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce increased by 90% compared to 1950 (calculated at comparable prices), and the residents' purchases of the most valuable food and industrial products greatly increased.
    Each Five-Year Plan is a historical milestone in the socialist economic and cultural development. With the Fifth Five-Year Plan victoriously completed, the Soviet Union has taken a huge step on the road from socialism to communism, greatly strengthening its economic power. Life has once again proven the great superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.
    The Soviet Union has entered the Sixth Five-Year Plan with a powerful large industry and advanced highly mechanized agriculture, and with a large number of skilled cadres in both cities and villages.

    苏联人民的伟大胜利
    第五个五年计划的总结
    苏联国家计划委员会司长　阿·杜金诺夫
    在历史上第一个建成社会主义的苏联人民，明确地向世界各国人民指出走向幸福和进步的道路。苏联的巨大成就和由苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所揭示的经济、科学、文化和劳动人民的物质福利的进一步强大高涨的宏伟远景鼓舞着各国人民为和平和民族独立、为新的社会制度的胜利而斗争。
    苏联是在国民经济强大高涨的时期举行第二十次代表大会的。顺利地完成第五个五年计划就明显和确凿地证明了这一点。
    让我们来谈谈国民经济的主要部门——工业。按照五年计划拟定工业产品的产额增加数目为70％。实际上，生产增加了85％。工业以四年零四个月的时间提前完成了五年计划。1955年超过战前1940年工业生产水平二点二倍。同时，在五年中生产资料的生产增加了91％，而五年计划规定的是80％。
    共产党遵循着列宁的关于建设共产主义的学说，过去和现在始终都是把苏联人民的努力集中在优先和更快地发展重工业上面的。苏联在1955年的生产情况如下：铣铁三千三百万吨，比1950年多74％；钢四千五百万吨，比1950年多66％；钢材三千五百万吨，比五年以前多69％；采煤三亿九千一百万吨，比1950年多50％；生产拖拉机十六万三千台，等等。机器制造业和金属加工业的产品，1955年比1950年增加了一点二倍，比1940年增加了三点七倍。电气化是创造共产主义物质技术基础的最重要的前提。在五年计划期间，许多巨大的水力发电站开始发电了。世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站的第一批联动机供电了。1954年世界上第一个原子能发电站在苏联投入生产了。1955年，苏联生产了一千七百亿度的电力，比1940年多二点五倍。苏联的电力生产占世界第二位。
    重工业的迅速增长保证国民经济各个部门的生产在先进技术的基础上不断地扩大。在第五个五年计划中，工业生产采用了自动装置、遥控装置和其他科学技术的最新成就。在和平利用原子能方面进行了巨大的工作。
    不断地、有计划地在国民经济中采用新的和最新的技术是社会主义生产进一步发展的必然条件。
    为采取新技术、为提高劳动生产率而展开的全民社会主义竞赛是苏维埃人关怀技术进步的明显证据。仅仅在1955年一年里，工人、工程师和技师就提供了约一百万项发明、改进和合理化建议。劳动人民的创造性倡议是苏联国民经济一切部门技术进步的取之不尽的源泉。
    由于重工业的迅速增长和先进技术的采用，国民经济一切部门中的机械化一年一年大规模地增加着。劳动生产率在提高，产品成本在降低。在第五个五年计划中，工人劳动生产率在工业中增加了44％，在建筑工程中增加了45％。在战后年间工业中的劳动生产率差不多增加了一点三倍。
    每一个国家的威力与其说是由生产水平的成就来决定，毋宁是说由生产水平增长的速度来决定。社会主义制度为生产力的发展开辟了无限广阔的场所。苏联人民在共产党的领导下，利用社会主义经济制度的巨大优越性，使工业生产不断的和有计划的高涨达到世界历史从来没有过的速度。只举出下面这点就够了：在1927年到1940年中，苏联产品每年平均增加18.6％，在同一个时期，美国每年平均增加总共只有2％；在1948年到1955年苏联工业每年增加16.6％，而美国的工业总共只增加4.1％。而且，美国和其他资本主义国家工业的增长是不平衡的，而整个资本主义世界的经济更加不稳定了。
    在社会主义经济同资本主义经济的经济竞赛中强调指出这一事实是重要的：苏联重工业最重要的产品的生产增长的绝对数量也超过了主要的资本主义国家。举金属为例。在最近五年中，美国的生铁产量增加了一千○六十万吨，英国、法国和西德合在一起增加了一千三百万吨，而苏联在这个时期增加了一千四百万吨。钢的产量美国增加了一千七百万吨，上述三个欧洲国家增加了一千六百七十万吨，而苏联则差不多增加了一千八百万吨。
    在苏联，重工业的优先增长的本身并不是目的。社会主义生产的目的在于满足苏联人民经常增长的物质和文化的需要。人民消费品的生产正是在第五个五年计划重工业优先发展的基础上大大地增加起来。1955年人民消费品的生产比1950年增加了76％，五年计划原拟定增加65％。1955年，苏联生产的棉织品比1950年多51％，毛织品多62％，动物油多59％，肉类多68％，等等。
    社会主义经济在扩大再生产的基础上发展起来。基本建设的不断增长是这种发展的显明标志。在第四个五年计划时期的投资是三千一百一十亿卢布，而在第五个五年计划则是五千九百四十亿卢布。仅仅在1955年一年里投入生产的就有八百多个用最新技术装备起来的新的大工厂。
    在社会主义工业化的基础上，苏联早在战前几个五年计划的年间就已经建立了巨大的、世界上最机械化的集体化的农业了。现在，苏联有九万多个集体农庄，九千个机器拖拉机站和约九千个国营农场。其中仅机器拖拉机站到1955年初就有一百零七万五千台拖拉机（以十五马力计算），三十五万多部谷物联合收获机和大量的其他农业机器。集体农庄的田野耕作业最重要工作的机械化的问题已经解决了。这是苏联人民的伟大胜利。集体农庄制度保证了农业劳动生产率的大大提高，增加了商品率和提高了集体农庄庄员的福利。
    在最近两年里，提高农业的问题已经是共产党和苏联政府不断注意的中心了。拟定了并且实际实现了社会主义农业急剧高涨的计划。
    在农业高涨的措施中，应当举出这样一些措施。为了向集体农庄和集体农庄庄员提供更大的物质鼓励，提高了农产品的征购和采购价格，扩大农业的机械化和矿物肥料的生产，派遣熟练的工作人员、农学家、机械操使者到机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场去工作，例如，曾从工业中派遣了两万九千名工程师和技师到机器拖拉机站去。
    由于实行上面所说的许多措施，1955年，农产品比1954年增加了，例如，谷物增加了22％，向日葵增加了95％，甜菜增加了54％。
    在最近两年中，集体农庄和国营农场开垦了三千三百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地。苏联人民在争取农业急剧高涨斗争中的这一卓越的胜利是由于重工业的迅速高涨、用先进技术武装起农业和苏维埃人的忘我劳动获得的。
    国民经济各部门的生产的增长是苏联人民物质福利不断提高的源泉。这方面的综合标志是国民收入的增加。苏联的国民收入完全用于人民的利益。国民收入的绝大部分——四分之三——用于人民的消费上。在第五个五年计划年间苏联的国民收入增加了68％。工人和职员的实际工资增加了39％，而农民的实际收入增加了50％。
    在第五个五年计划期间住宅建筑的大大增加，零售商品流转的扩大和居民在储蓄银行存款的增长是劳动人民物质福利不断提高的显明标志。
    1955年国营商业和合作社商业卖给居民的商品比1950年增加了90％（按比较价格计算），而且，居民对最贵重的食品和工业品的购买大大地增加了。
    每一个五年计划都是社会主义经济和文化发展的历史里程碑。第五个五年计划胜利地完成了，苏联在从社会主义到共产主义的道路上迈了巨大的一步，大大地加强了自己的经济威力。生活再一次证明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的巨大优越性。
    苏联以强有力的大工业和先进的高度机械化的农业，在城市和乡村都拥有大批的熟练干部的情况下进入了第六个五年计划。
