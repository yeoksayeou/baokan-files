    Strive to Develop Meteorological Undertakings
    Human production activities and daily life are closely related to weather and climate. Meteorology is a science that studies the laws of atmospheric physical processes, through which people understand the laws of weather evolution and climate, use them to prevent natural disasters, and utilize climate resources. In the great cause of controlling and transforming nature, meteorology is of great importance.
    The Party and the government have always been concerned about the development of China's meteorological undertakings. As early as the beginning of the national liberation, China began to actively establish meteorological stations and train meteorological cadres throughout the country. By the end of 1955, the number of meteorological stations in China had increased to more than eleven times that of 1949; the number of meteorological personnel had increased to thirteen times that of 1949. Thanks to the above foundation, the accuracy rate of severe weather forecasts has now reached 80%-85%; the accuracy rate of general short-term weather forecasts has reached 70%-80%; medium-term weather forecasts and long-term weather forecasts have also begun. China's meteorological work has reached international standards in individual projects.
    In recent years, China's weather forecasts have not only basically ensured the safety of aviation and navigation, but also played an important role in ensuring agricultural production and people's lives. In 1954, the water levels of the four major rivers, the Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Han, in China rose sharply, and the water situation was serious. Because we knew in advance from meteorology that the cold air from Siberia and the warm air from the Pacific Ocean would meet in China for a long time, and we knew the location of the center of each rainstorm, we were able to make various necessary preparations and deployments to reduce the losses of the country and the people. In recent years, China's typhoon, gale, and frost forecasts and warnings have also reduced many losses in agriculture, fishery, salt industry, and animal husbandry production. Although China's climate data service work started relatively late, it has also participated in the planning work for the fundamental cure of the Yellow River in recent years, and participated in the design work of various basic constructions, especially the 156 huge construction projects, providing necessary climate data for the design work of these construction projects.
    With the development of China's construction undertakings, especially the rapid development of agricultural production, the tasks of meteorological work are becoming more and more arduous. In order to prevent natural disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and freezes, it is necessary to have more specific, more comprehensive, and more accurate severe weather forecasts and warnings. In order to use various favorable meteorological conditions to plan production, it is necessary to have general daily weather forecasts, especially medium-term and long-term weather forecasts. In order to improve varieties, improve soil, improve crops, and expand cultivated areas, meteorological departments need to provide a large amount of climate data, accelerate the study of local climate characteristics, and carry out work such as dividing agricultural climate regions. Because the effects of various meteorological factors on different crops are different, in order to meet the needs of the production of grains, various cash crops, and subtropical crops, it is also required to provide specialized agricultural meteorological services that are tailored to their characteristics. As for the development of forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and various other sideline productions, the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects, and the elimination of diseases and insect pests, all require meteorological work to provide necessary data.
    However, the foundation of China's meteorological undertakings is still very weak, and it is far from meeting the above needs. Therefore, we must take various necessary measures to develop meteorological undertakings more, faster, better, and more economically, and accelerate the improvement of meteorological service levels. To accelerate the improvement of meteorological service levels, we must grasp two basic links: the construction of meteorological stations and meteorological scientific research. Meteorological stations are the basis of all meteorological work and meteorological services. We should strive to basically build China's meteorological station network in the next seven or twelve years, so that it can basically meet the needs of meteorological services in terms of quantity, density, and quality. In order to better guide meteorological practical work and improve meteorological service levels, it is necessary to establish various necessary meteorological scientific research work to ensure that after twelve years, we can basically solve the important problems related to meteorological services raised by China's national construction, especially agricultural production. Whether it is expanding meteorological stations or strengthening meteorological research, it is necessary to quickly take all possible methods to cultivate more meteorological scientific and technical personnel and meteorological experts from all aspects, and require party, government, and military leadership organs and national economic departments, national defense construction departments, and even the people of the whole country to give strong support and assistance.
    In the vigorous development of meteorological undertakings, meteorological workers across the country have a direct responsibility, and every meteorological worker must do his job wholeheartedly. In recent years, the vast majority of meteorological workers in China have been enthusiastic and hardworking. They have overcome high mountains, great rivers, harsh climates, and difficult living conditions, and built meteorological stations in plains, mountains, deserts, grasslands, islands, and even many uninhabited areas. Their work is an indispensable part of the country's socialist construction. However, there are still some individuals who do not see the importance of this work, are not at ease in their positions, have a weak sense of responsibility, and sometimes have some accidents due to negligence. These comrades should quickly change their attitudes. All meteorological workers must actively strive to study the advanced meteorological scientific theories and experiences of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. Senior meteorological scientific and technical cadres must not only strive to improve their technical level, but also pass on their knowledge to young meteorological workers; young meteorological workers must learn with an open mind. We must master the world's major new achievements in meteorological science in a relatively short period of time, and then continue to rapidly improve on this basis, and strive to catch up with international standards in twelve years.

### 努力发展气象事业

    努力发展气象事业
    人类的生产活动和日常生活，都和天气、气候有着密切的关系。气象科学就是研究大气物理过程规律的一门科学，人们通过它来认识天气演变和气候的规律，用来预防自然灾害，利用气候资源。在控制自然和改造自然的伟大事业中，气象科学有着极大的重要性。
    党和政府一向是关心我国气象事业的发展的。还在全国解放之初，我国就着手在全国范围内积极建立气象台站，训练气象干部。到1955年底，我国的气象台站已增至1949年的十一倍以上；气象工作人员增至1949年的十三倍。由于有了以上的基础，目前灾害性天气预报的准确率已达80％—85％；一般短期天气预报的准确率达到了70％—80％；中期天气预报与长期天气预报也已开始。我国气象工作在个别项目上已经达到了国际水平。
    几年来，我国的天气预报不仅基本上保证了航空、航海的安全，同时在保障农业生产和人民生活方面也起了重要的作用。1954年我国江、河、淮、汉四条大河水位陡涨，水情严重。由于从气象上事先知道了西伯利亚的冷空气与太平洋的暖空气将长期在我国交接，知道了每次暴雨中心的所在，我们就有可能作出各种必要的准备和布署，减少了国家和人民的损失。几年来，我国的台风、大风、霜冻预报和警报，也使农业、渔业、盐业、畜牧业的生产减少了许多损失。我国的气候资料服务工作虽然开始得比较晚，但几年来也已经参加了根治黄河的规划工作，参加了各项基本建设、尤其是156项巨大建设的设计工作，为这些建设工程的设计工作提供了必要的气候资料。
    随着我国各项建设事业的发展，特别是农业生产的迅速发展，气象工作的任务也越来越繁重了。为了预防水、旱、风、冻等自然灾害，就需要更具体、更多方面和更准确的灾害性天气预报和警报。为了利用各种有利的气象条件来规划生产，就需要一般性的日常的天气预报，特别是中期和长期天气预报。为了改良品种，改良土壤，改善作物，扩大耕种面积，就需要气象部门提供大量的气候资料，加速研究各地的气候特点，并进行划分农业气候区域等工作。因为各种气象因子对于不同农作物的影响不同，为了适应谷物、各种经济作物及副热带作物等生产的需要，还要求提供针对其特点所进行的专业化农业气象服务。至于发展林业、畜牧业、渔业和其他各种副业生产，兴修小型水利，消灭病虫害等工作，也都要求气象工作提供必要的资料。
    但是，我国气象事业基础还很薄弱，远不能满足上述需要。因此我们就必须采取各种必要的措施，又多、又快、又好、又省地发展气象事业，加速提高气象服务水平。要加速提高气象服务水平，就必须抓住两个基本环节，一是气象台站建设，一是气象科学研究。气象台站是所有气象工作、气象服务的基础，应该争取在未来七年或十二年内基本上建成我国的气象台站网，使之在数量上、密度上和质量上都能基本上满足气象服务的需要。为了更好地指导气象实际工作和提高气象服务水平，必须建立各种必要的气象科学研究工作，保证在十二年以后，基本上能够解决我国国家建设特别是农业生产所提出的与气象服务有关的重要问题。无论是扩充气象台站或加强气象研究，都需要迅速采取一切可能的方法从各个方面培养出更多的气象科学技术人员和气象专家，都要求党政军各级领导机关和国民经济部门、国防建设部门以至全国人民给以大力的支持和协助。
    在大力发展气象事业中，全国气象工作人员负有直接的责任，每个气象工作者都必须全力以赴地作好自己的工作。几年来，我国绝大多数气象工作人员是热情努力的。他们战胜了高山、大河、恶劣的气候和困难的生活条件，在平原、高山、沙漠、草地、岛屿以至许多荒无人烟的地区建起气象台站来。他们的工作是国家在社会主义建设事业中不可缺少的一个部分。但是也还有个别的人看不到这种工作的重要意义，不安心于自己的岗位，工作责任心不强，有时发生一些责任事故。这些同志应当赶快改变自己的态度。全体气象工作人员都必须积极努力，学习苏联和各人民民主国家的先进气象科学理论和经验。高级的气象科学技术干部除了自己要努力提高技术水平以外，还必须把自己的知识传授给年青的气象工作者；年青的气象工作者必须虚心学习。我们一定要在较短的时期内掌握世界上主要的气象科学新成就，然后在这一基础上继续迅速提高，争取在十二年后赶上国际水平。
