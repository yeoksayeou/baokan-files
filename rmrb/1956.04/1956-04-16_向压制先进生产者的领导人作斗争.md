To the Editor:

A stonemason work team of the Earthwork Engineering Team of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways created a "stone masonry grout-squeezing assembly line method" in the construction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. Using this advanced working method not only resulted in high efficiency and good quality, but also saved cement. Therefore, the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways invited this work team to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway for nine months of rotating demonstrations. The demonstrations further proved the benefits of this advanced method – using this method, only 80-odd catties of cement were needed for each cubic meter of rubble masonry (the regulation requires 160 catties), the project quality met the standards, and the efficiency exceeded the quota by more than one time.

In January 1954, the workers of this work team returned to their original work unit with the thirteen banners presented to them by the employees of the Second Engineering Bureau. Who knew that from then on, they and their advanced experience would suffer an unfortunate fate. All ten members of the team were dispatched to the construction engineering team for "assistance" here and there, and the advanced experience of the "stone masonry grout-squeezing assembly line method" was neglected. At that time, all the workers of the team went to Zhang Jianguo, the deputy captain of the First Detachment of the Construction Engineering Team, requesting to restore the work team in order to promote the masonry experience. Zhang Jianguo's reply was: "Forget it, what's so great about you!" The workers also went to the captain of the Construction Engineering Team and the leading comrades of the First Engineering Bureau to raise their opinions, but this not only failed to solve the problem, but also subjected them to Zhang Jianguo's sarcasm and attacks. As a result, some workers dared not mention the promotion of advanced experience anymore.

However, Zhang Liangui, a worker of this work team, has been persistent in fighting for the promotion of this advanced experience. Wherever he went, he publicized and promoted the "stone masonry grout-squeezing assembly line method" to the workers. In September 1954, his group broke the stone masonry quota by one time because they promoted the "stone masonry grout-squeezing assembly line method." However, this fact did not educate the leaders of the First Detachment to correct their erroneous attitude; on the contrary, they constantly found fault with Zhang Liangui in their work. In August 1954, they transferred Zhang Liangui to the Second Detachment on a pretext.

After Zhang Liangui arrived at the Second Detachment, he continued to publicize and promote this advanced experience. Soon, the efficiency of his group increased from five and a half cubic meters per day to thirteen cubic meters, and the mortar saved was 30% per cubic meter. The leaders of the Second Detachment attached great importance to this achievement and immediately made Zhang Liangui the group leader, and at the same time organized all the stone masonry groups in the detachment to learn from them. As a result, this advanced method was promoted in the Second Detachment. Last year, the Second Detachment saved more than 7,000 kilograms of cement on the stone masonry project of just one building.

Recently, the headquarters of the Construction Engineering Team asked the stone masonry group led by Zhang Liangui to perform a demonstration in the First Detachment, and asked the First Detachment to learn a lesson and organize workers to study and promote the "stone masonry grout-squeezing assembly line method." However, the leaders of the First Detachment still insisted on their erroneous attitude and took various measures to obstruct this demonstration. They not only deliberately found a place that was difficult to get materials and had two corner walls for Zhang Liangui's group to work on and did not provide them with sufficient rubble; they also did not organize workers to visit. On the last day of the performance, due to the urging of the superior leadership unit, they only called more than forty rubble workers to take a look at the demonstration site.

The erroneous attitude of the leaders of the First Detachment towards the advanced experience of the "stone masonry grout-squeezing assembly line method" is intolerable. I believe that in addition to seriously dealing with this incident, the First Engineering Bureau should thoroughly check the work of the First Detachment in promoting advanced experience.

    向压制先进生产者的领导人作斗争编辑同志：
    铁道部第一工程局土石方工程队的一个砌石工班，在修建天兰铁路的工程中创造了一种“砌石挤浆流水作业法”。使用这种先进工作法，不但工率高、质量好，而且还能节省水泥。因此，铁道部第二工程局就邀请这个工班到宝成铁路去作了九个月的轮流示范表演。在表演中，进一步证明了这个先进方法的好处——用这种方法每砌一方片石只要用水泥八十多斤（按规定要用一百六十斤），工程质量合乎标准，工率也超过定额一倍以上。
    1954年一月，这个工班的工人带着第二工程局职工给他们的十三面锦旗回到了原来的工作单位。谁知道，从此他们和他们的先进经验就遭到了不幸的命运。全班十个人被东一个、西一个地派到建筑工程队去“助勤”，“砌石挤浆流水作业法”的先进经验也就没人过问了。当时，全班工人曾找建筑工程队第一分队副分队长张建国，要求恢复工班，以便推广砌石经验。张建国的回答是：“算了吧，你们有什么了不起！”工人们又去找建筑工程队大队长和第一工程局领导同志提意见，但是这不仅没有使问题得到解决，反而使他们受到了张建国的讽刺和打击。因此，有些工人就不敢再提起推广先进经验的事情了。
    但是，这个工班的工人张连贵一直坚持为推广这个先进经验斗争。他到一个单位，就向工人们宣传和推行“砌石挤浆流水作业法”。1954年九月间，他所在的组因为推广了“砌石挤浆流水作业法”，曾突破砌石定额一倍。但是，这个事实并没有使第一分队的领导人受到教育，改正自己的错误态度；相反地，他们在工作中不断找张连贵的岔子，1954年八月间，他们就借故把张连贵调到第二分队去了。
    张连贵到了第二分队以后，又不断宣传和推广这个先进经验。不久，他所在小组的工率由每天五方半提高到十三方，每方又节省灰浆30％。第二分队领导人很重视这个成绩，马上让张连贵当了组长，同时组织全分队的砌石小组都向他们学习。于是，这个先进方法在第二分队被推广了，去年第二分队仅在一座楼的砌石工程上，就节省了七千多公斤水泥。
    最近，建筑工程队大队部让张连贵领导的砌石小组到第一分队作示范表演，并且要第一分队接受教训，组织工人学习推广“砌石挤浆流水作业法”。但是第一分队的领导人仍然坚持自己的错误态度，并且采取了各种办法来阻挠这次示范表演。他们不但故意找了一处不易进料和有两处拐墙的地方让张连贵小组干活和不供给他们充分的料石；而且还不组织工人们去参观。到了表演的最后一天，因为上级领导单位的督促，他们才叫四十多个片石工到示范的工点去看了一下。
    第一分队领导人对待“砌石挤浆流水作业法”这个先进经验的错误态度是令人不能容忍的。我认为第一工程局除了要对这个事件作严肃处理以外，并且应该彻底检查第一分队推广先进经验的工作。
