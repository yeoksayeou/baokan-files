    Safe Driving Driver
    By our reporter Fu Dong
    When people talk about the model deeds of Chen Rongcai, a driver at the Hangzhou Transportation Office, they always speak with admiration about how he safely drove more than 260,000 kilometers without any accidents or major repairs to the vehicle.
    However, Chen Rongcai wasn't always such a good driver.
    In the winter of 1949, Chen Rongcai was driving a passenger bus from Hangzhou to Yixing. As he sat in the car, watching the road rapidly receding outside the window, he felt an unspeakable sense of joy. But after traveling only sixty miles, the car suddenly stopped. He thoroughly checked it, front and back, and found that there was a problem with the distributor. But when he opened the toolbox, he found that he hadn't brought a single tool. He was so anxious that he ran back and forth on the road, hoping that another car would come along to help him out. He waited and waited, but it wasn't until it was already dark that he saw any sign of a car. To make a phone call, he would have to go twenty miles. At this time, the wind was blowing harder and harder, and some passengers became impatient and scolded him: "Why are you making us spend the night in the wilderness?" "Why didn't you fix the car at home?" He said many kind words to the passengers and finally managed to settle them in a nearby village, while he returned to the driver's seat to watch over the car. At night, listening to the howling wind outside the window, he felt cold and scared. One moment he thought, what if one or two counter-revolutionaries suddenly emerged from the mountains? The next moment he thought about how impolite the passengers were being. The more he thought, the more annoyed he became, and he didn't sleep all night. Later, when he calmed down, he realized that he could only blame himself. Why didn't he check the car and the tools before driving? From then on, he made a rule for himself: he would carefully check the car and tools every time before setting off.
    On another occasion, he was traveling from Hangzhou to Ningbo. A pair of passengers were talking behind him. One said, "The last car I took drove very fast. This car is as slow as an old man." The other said, "This driver must be okay, he'll get there soon enough." The passengers were anxious and wanted to arrive early, so they taunted him. As soon as he heard this, he lost his composure. The car was already going fast enough, but he sped up even more. Unexpectedly, a person suddenly ran out from the side of the road. It looked like a collision was inevitable, and it was too late to brake. He quickly turned the steering wheel to dodge, and as a result, both the car and the person fell into a ditch. The car was wrecked, and the pedestrian's head was broken. From then on, he never recklessly drove fast again, and always traveled at a speed of thirty kilometers per hour.
    At the Hangzhou Transportation Office, several incidents like this had happened: drivers smoking cigarettes on the road, accidentally dropping sparks on the cotton and hemp they were carrying, and in the blink of an eye, the fire would burn everything to ashes. Two cars even had their tires burned. There were also cases where passengers sitting in the front of the car would doze off, and when the driver suddenly braked in an emergency, the passengers would hit their heads on the car's glass. Some passengers would put their hands outside the car window and be injured by passing cars. Chen Rongcai thought about all these things and realized that not only did drivers need to be vigilant, but passengers also needed to be careful. So, every time before driving, he would take a few minutes to tell the passengers not to smoke in the car, not to put their hands outside the window, and for passengers sitting in the two front seats not to doze off.
    One day, Chen Rongcai saw a message on the blackboard: a woman was walking on the right side of the road, and her child was walking on the left side of the road. When the adult saw a car coming, she told the child to stand still, but when the child saw the car approaching, he panicked and ran towards the adult instead. The driver couldn't brake in time and ran over the child. From this, Chen Rongcai also recalled some other things that he had encountered. Once, he saw a child herding cattle playing on the left side of the road, and the cow was grazing on the right side of the road. Who knew that when the car was about to arrive, the cow suddenly jumped up in fright, and the child, afraid that the cow would get into trouble, ran towards the cow and was almost hit. These two things were deeply imprinted in his mind, and whenever he encountered similar situations in the future, he would honk his horn a hundred meters away, then coast past and gently brake.
    Drivers often talked about driving together. One day, a driver named Fu Bingquan said, "People who know how to ride a bicycle pedal with their toes, while people who don't ride well pedal with the balls of their feet or their heels, and their butts wiggle back and forth." Chen Rongcai paid attention and found that this was indeed the case, so from then on, when he encountered people who didn't ride bicycles well, he would drive a little slower.
    Chen Rongcai often encountered things like this while driving. Some people would walk slowly on the road, and no matter how much you honked the horn, they would continue walking as if nothing were happening. He was very anxious. Later, he learned that some elderly people were deaf and couldn't hear, and sometimes they couldn't hear because they were walking against the wind, so he paid attention to this from then on.
    Several drivers at the Transportation Office were demoted to cleaning workers. There was no question about their driving skills, they were all masters, but they didn't sleep when they should at night, but instead played poker or went to the theater. When they went on duty the next day, they were drowsy and sleepy, and as a result, they drove the car into the fields or ditches. Not only was the car damaged, but their lives were also in danger.
    Chen Rongcai was heartbroken when he heard these things. He thought that every time before he drove, there were always people seeing the passengers off who said things like "Have a safe trip," "Write a letter as soon as you arrive so we don't worry," "Be careful getting on and off the car," and so on. He thought to himself: If I don't drive well and something happens, so many people will be worried! He understood the feelings of the passengers very well. In 1948, when he returned to his hometown of Yiwu from Hangzhou to get married, he wrote a letter to his family before leaving, telling them which train he would be arriving on that day. As a result, his father went to the station to pick him up. But he waited and waited without seeing him arrive. Later, he heard that the train he was on had derailed, and many people had died. His father inquired everywhere and was almost driven mad with anxiety. Chen Rongcai said: "If you know the feelings of the passengers, then you should always think of them. Don't the leaders often say that people are the most valuable asset of the country, and drivers should always think about their safety?"
    "Not only should the passengers arrive safely, but the car shouldn't have any problems either." Chen Rongcai paid great attention to the maintenance and repair of the car. Every thousand kilometers, he would add grease to the car's moving joints; every five or six thousand kilometers, he would change the oil and the oil filter core, and also add oil to the four wheel axles' ball bearings. He always worked with the technicians on minor repairs to the car. He said that drivers should be familiar with the car, just like a mother is familiar with her child, and know where it has problems. Then they can tell the doctor and prescribe the right medicine, and it will get better quickly. At the same time, watching the doctor treat the illness can gradually teach you some medical skills. In this way, if his car had minor problems, he could fix them himself immediately.
    On the highway from Hangzhou to Linhai, you have to climb over high mountains. Chen Rongcai discovered that when the car was going downhill after climbing over a mountain, the engine wouldn't work very well and it was difficult to drive. What was the reason for this? One day, when he was studying the Soviet Union's advanced experience in engine maintenance, he realized that protecting the engine's temperature was very important. He thought that if a person suddenly gets cold and hot, they will catch a cold. If the car gets very hot when going uphill, and then suddenly cools down when going downhill, it will easily cause problems. So he made a cloth curtain for the outside of the engine, rolling it up when going uphill and letting it down when going downhill.
    Chen Rongcai saw that when people carry things, if a person's strength can only carry fifty kilograms, and you give him sixty kilograms to carry, he won't be able to carry it for long; but if you give him fifty kilograms to carry, he can walk very far. He thought that this simple principle could also be applied to cars. When loading people and goods, don't exceed the car's load capacity, so as not to damage the engine.
    There is an air filter cover in the car, and Chen Rongcai always keeps it clean. He said: "The engine is like a person's lungs, and the air filter cover is like a mask. When a person wears a mask, dirty things can't get into the lungs. With an air filter cover, dust and sand can't get into the engine."
    After minor repairs to the car, Chen Rongcai paid special attention to driving slowly at first. He said: "When the car has just been repaired, the parts are not as tightly organized as before, so you can't use it too hard, just like a woman who has just given birth to a child can't do heavy work."
    Chen Rongcai's advanced experience was accumulated bit by bit from his daily work under the conditions that he understood that he should wholeheartedly serve the passengers and cherish state property. (Attached picture)

    安全行车的驾驶员
    本报记者　傅冬
    人们谈起杭州运输处驾驶员陈荣材的模范事迹，总是用敬佩的口吻讲他怎么样安全行驶二十六万多公里没出过事，没大修过车。
    可是陈荣材并不是一开始就开得那么好的。
    1949年冬天。陈荣材驾驶着一辆客车从杭州去宜兴。当他坐在车里看着那窗外飞速倒退过去的马路，心里真有说不出的痛快。可是车子刚走了六十里忽然不动了。他前前后后仔仔细细检查了一遍，发现是配电盘出了毛病。可是打开工具箱一看，一件工具也没有带，他急得在马路上跑来跑去，希望赶快来辆车子救救急。等来等去，直到天已经黑了，还没个车影子。打电话吧，得跑到二十里路外的地方。这时风一阵比一阵刮得紧，有些旅客等得不耐烦了，就大发脾气骂他：“你为什么叫我们在野地里过夜？”“你为什么不把车子在家弄好？”他给旅客说了许多好话，好不容易才把旅客安顿到附近村子里，自己回到驾驶室看车。夜里听着那狂风在窗外呼啸，心里又冷又怕。一会儿想，要是从山里突然钻出一、两个反革命分子怎办？一会儿又想到旅客的态度怎么那么不客气？越想越烦，整夜也没睡着。后来平静下来，才想到这只能怨自己，为什么不在开车前检查一下车子和工具？从这以后，他就给自己订了一条规则：每次出发前都要认真检查一遍车子和工具。
    另一次是由杭州去宁波。一对旅客在他背后谈话。这个说：“我上次坐的那个车开得很快。这个车却像老爷似的慢腾腾的。”另一个说：“这个驾驶员一定也没问题，很快就会开到。”坐汽车的人心急，想早点到，用话刺他。他一听就沉不住气了。本来车开得就够快的，这时他又加快了速度。没想到突然从路边闯出一个人，眼看就要碰上了，刹车也来不及，他急转方向盘往旁边躲，结果连人带车翻到沟里，车子摔坏了，那个行人的头也被撞破了。从此他再也不冒冒失失地开快车，他总是按照每小时三十公里的速度走着。
    在杭州运输处发生过好几次这样的事：驾驶员在路上吸香烟，不小心，把火星弄到车上拉的棉花和麻上，遇上风，一眨眼功夫，烧得精光。有两个车连轮胎都烧坏了。也有这样的事，坐在车前的旅客在车上打瞌睡，路上发生了紧急情况，驾驶员一急刹车，旅客不知道，头给汽车玻璃碰破了。有些旅客把手放在汽车窗外，被来往的汽车撞伤。陈荣材把这许多事联起来想，有些事不光光驾驶员要提高警惕，还得旅客注意。于是，每次开车前，他都要用几分钟的时间给旅客讲一讲，不要在车上吸香烟，不要把手放在窗外，坐在车前面两个位子的旅客不要打瞌睡。
    有一天，陈荣材在黑板报上看到一条消息：一个妇女在道儿右边走，她的小孩在道儿左边走着。大人一见来了汽车，就叫小孩站住不要动，那知小孩一见汽车走到跟前，着了慌，反而没头没脑地往大人那边跑。驾驶员刹车也来不及，就把小孩压死了。由这事，陈荣材又联想起自己碰见的另一些事。有一次他看见一个放牛的小孩在路左边玩，牛在路右边吃草。谁晓得车快到了，牛忽然害怕得跳起来，小孩怕牛出事，就往牛那边跑，差点给撞死。这两件事深深印在他的脑里，以后碰到类似的情况，他就在一百公尺以外的地方按喇叭，然后滑行过去，轻轻刹车。
    驾驶员们在一块常谈出车的事。有一天一位叫傅秉铨的驾驶员说：“会骑自行车的人，用脚尖蹬车，骑自行车骑得不好的人用脚心或脚后跟蹬，屁股扭来扭去。”陈荣材一注意果然如此，以后碰到骑自行车骑得不好的人，他就把车开得慢一点。
    陈荣材在行车中还常常碰到这样的事。有些人在马路上慢悠悠地走，不管你怎么按喇叭，他们却像没事似的继续走着。他非常着急。后来一了解，原来有些老年人耳聋听不见，有时是因为顶风听不见，以后他就留意这点了。
    运输处有几个驾驶员被降职作了清洁工。论开车手艺没说的，都是一把好手，可是他们晚上该睡觉的时候，不睡觉，却去打扑克或者去看戏。到第二天出差时昏头昏脑，上了车瞌睡来了，结果把车开到田里、沟里，车撞坏了不说，人还有生命的危险。
    陈荣材听到这些事很痛心。他想到每一次开车前，总有送行的人对旅客说：“一路平安”“到了马上来信免得惦记”“上下车要小心”等等。他心里就想：假如自己开不好车，出了事，好多人都要着急呵！他很了解旅客的心情。1948年他由杭州回义乌家乡结婚，临走时他给家里写了封信说他那一天那一班火车可到站。结果他父亲到车站去接他。可是左等右等不见他到，后来听说他坐的那趟火车出轨了，死了好些人。他父亲就到处打听，差点急疯了。陈荣材说：“自己知道旅客的心情，那就应该处处为他们着想。领导同志不是常说，人是国家最宝贵的财产，驾驶员应常常想到他们的安全吗？
    “不光光叫旅客一路平安到达，车子也不应出一点毛病。”陈荣材很注意汽车的保养和修理，每走一千公里，他就在汽车活动关节上加一次黄油；走五、六千公里，就换机油和机油滤清器子心，同时给四个轮轴的弹子盘加油。车子小修，他总是和技工一块搞。他说，驾驶员熟悉车子，应该像母亲熟悉自己的孩子一样，知道他那儿有毛病，就告诉医生，对症下药，好的就快。同时自己在旁边看着医生治病也能渐渐学会一些治病的本事。这样，他的车有小毛病，他自己马上就修好了。
    在杭州到临海的公路上，要翻过高山。陈荣材发现车子爬过山头下坡的时候，机器就不大灵了，开起来很费劲。这是什么缘故？有一天他学习苏联保养发动机的先进经验的时候，发现保护发动机温度很重要。他想，一个人一冷一热要伤风，车子上山时把发动机搞得很热，下山时忽然一下子关冷，这样当然容易生毛病。他就给发动机外面做了个布帘，上山时卷起，下山时放下。
    陈荣材看见人挑东西的时候，如果一个人的气力只能挑一百斤，给他一百二十斤东西叫他挑，不一会就挑不动了；如果给他挑一百斤，那就能走很远。他想这个简单的道理也可以运用到汽车身上，装人装货都不要超过汽车的载重量，免得叫引擎受损害。
    汽车里有个空气滤清罩，陈荣材经常把它擦得干干净净。他说：引擎就好比人的肺一样，空气滤清罩好比口罩，人带上口罩，脏东西进不到肺里。有了空气滤清罩，灰沙进不到引擎里。
    汽车小修后，陈荣材特别注意，开时总是先慢慢地走。他说：“车刚修好，机件不像先前那样组织得紧密了，不能用得过火，就好比一个女人刚生了小孩，不能作重活一样。”
    陈荣材的先进经验，就是在他懂得应该忠心地为旅客服务和爱护国家财产的条件下一点一滴地从日常工作中积累起来的。（附图片）
