Dear Friends!

In our era, science is of utmost importance to all mankind. Science touches all aspects of people's lives and activities. Its power has developed to an unprecedented extent. The truly enormous achievements of modern natural science demonstrate the infinite possibilities of human wisdom and its ability to solve all the tasks that appear before it.

Therefore, the status of scientists in society has greatly increased, and at the same time, their responsibility to all mankind is particularly significant.

We are all well aware that science is a double-edged sword. Its achievements can well serve the happiness and welfare of people, but it can also be used to destroy cultural wealth and annihilate millions of innocent people.

However, it is not irrelevant to scientists, to true scientists, for what purpose the scientific achievements they have obtained by contributing their wisdom and ability are used. A scientist's conscience can never calmly gaze at the things he has created with his own hands being used for destruction, because this is contrary to his will.

I cannot help but think of the famous explorer, ethnographer, a man of great wisdom and ardent heart, a great friend of backward peoples, Maclay, who studied the life and culture of Australian aborigines and Melanesians, and spent many years among them on remote Pacific islands. His contribution to science still remains decisive. But how distressed he was because his research paved the way for the colonialists. How valiantly he struggled and vehemently resisted the annihilation and inhuman exploitation of the inhabitants of "Maclay Coast." Of course, this is not merely the researcher's hope that the object of his scientific work will remain intact, but contains the deep love of a loyal humanitarian, for whom the life and happiness of any ordinary person, regardless of the color of their skin or the shape of their skull, is the most precious.

Our other geographer, famous for a series of discoveries on the Asian continent, but even more well-known in the world for his writings as a theorist of anarchism, Kropotkin, wrote that those scientific activists who strive to isolate themselves from the world with the walls of their laboratories and seek enjoyment in the creative process and try to forget about life, but never care about the results of this creation for ordinary people, for the people, remind one of opium addicts who try to forget about life in narcotics.

For me personally, the idea and slogan that "science can only be called science when it serves human happiness" is particularly close to my heart, because my mentor—not only in chemistry, but also in life, the outstanding scholar of our country, Academician Bach, once told me that when he moved to the quiet shores of Lake Geneva to escape persecution by the Tsarist government and worked in a well-equipped laboratory, he felt great spiritual distress because he could not participate in the struggle for the future of human happiness.

In order not only to mention the names of people who are closer and more familiar to me than to everyone else, I would also like to mention a scientist that we all know and respect, and that many of us love—the chairman of our association, Frédéric Joliot-Curie. He is such a scientist: he has reached the glorious summit in his specialized field, but he never crouches in the so-called "ivory tower" of "pure science," but with all his energy, sparing no time or health, he struggles to prevent the scientific achievements of our time from being used for destructive purposes, to eradicate from people's minds the now widely prevalent view that science mainly brings means of destruction, and to apply all valuable possibilities as soon as possible to promote future progress.

The first sentence of our association's charter mentions that the main task of the association is to improve human welfare through the application and development of scientific knowledge, and that science can and should be used for human welfare. Our association is an important social factor that helps scientists realize how great a responsibility they bear to humanity in correctly applying science for progressive purposes.

I believe that the association has given great support to many scholars around the world in their labor struggles. Their labor struggle is to make scientific achievements serve mankind and build a happy future. Now, the association has established what we call in Russian "the feeling of the elbow" (I don't know if other countries' languages have such a vocabulary). This vocabulary means that when you touch the person standing next to you with your elbow, you will directly feel that you are not alone in the struggle, and feel that there are people next to you who are fighting for the same ideals, for science to benefit mankind. At first glance, this is an abstract feeling, but it is a very real and important factor, and at the same time it will undoubtedly become a foundation, a basis for taking concrete measures on the road to solving the tasks stipulated in our charter. Please allow me to congratulate our young, growing organization on its tenth anniversary for its achievements in a difficult but noble struggle, so that science can truly be fully used only for the happiness of the people of the world.

### 世界科学工作者协会副主席  奥巴林院士的发言

    世界科学工作者协会副主席
    奥巴林院士的发言亲爱的朋友！
    在我们这个时代科学对全人类具有极其重要的意义。科学涉及了人们生活与活动的一切方面。它的威力已发展到空前未有的程度。现代自然科学真正巨大的成就说明人类智慧的无限可能性，说明人类的智慧是能够解决出现在他面前的一切任务的。
    因此科学家在社会中的地位大大地提高了，同时他们对全人类的责任也是特殊重大的。
    我们大家都很清楚地知道，科学是利害兼具的武器，它的成就可以很好地服务于人们的幸福和福利，但是也可以被用来破坏文化财富，毁灭千百万无辜的人们。
    但是科学家贡献了自己智慧和能力而获得的科学成就服务于什么目的，对他们，对真正的科学家来说，并不是毫无关系的。科学家的良心永远不能使他平心地凝视着他亲手所创造的事也被用于毁灭，用于破坏，因为这与他的意志是相反的。
    我不自主地想到著名的探险家、人种学家、具有伟大智慧和热烈心灵的人、落后民族伟大的朋友马克莱，他研究了澳大利亚土人和美拉尼西亚人的生活和文化，并且在太平洋遥远的海岛上，在他们中间度过了许多年代。他对科学的贡献直到现在还保持着具有决定性的意义。但是他是多么苦恼，因为他的研究为殖民主义者开拓了道路。他是多么英勇地奋斗并热诚地反抗歼灭和非人性地剥削“马克莱之岸”的居民。当然，这不仅仅是研究者希望自己科学工作的对象保持原封不动，而是蕴积着忠诚不渝的人道主义者深厚的博爱，对这种人来说不论民族皮肤的颜色和头颅的形状如何，任何普通人的生命和幸福都是最宝贵的。
    我们另一位以亚洲大陆上一系列发现而闻名的地理学家，但是更以无政府主义的理论家而知名于世界著作的克罗包特金写过，那些力求用自己实验室墙壁与世界隔绝并在创作过程中寻求享受和企图忘却生活，然而从不关心这一创造对普通的人们、对人民的结果会怎样的科学活动家，使人想起在麻醉剂中企图忘却生活的鸦片烟瘾的人。
    对于我个人说来，“科学只有当它服务于人类幸福时才能称为科学”这样的思想和口号，是感到特别亲切的，因为我的导师——不仅是化学方面，而且是生活中的导师，我国卓越的学者巴赫院士曾经向我讲述过，他因躲避沙皇政府迫害而移居到静静的日内瓦湖岸上，在设备极好的实验室中工作的时候，因不能参与为人类幸福未来的斗争而感到精神上极大的苦恼。
    为了不仅仅提到我比大家较为接近、较为熟悉的人的名字，我还要提到我们大家都知道而尊敬的，我们许多人都热爱的科学家——我们协会的主席弗列德利·约里奥—居里。他就是这样一位科学家：他在自己专门方面达到了光辉的绝顶，但却从来不蜷伏在所谓“纯科学”的“象牙之塔”内，而以全副精力，不惜自己的时间和健康，为了使我们时代的科学成就不用于破坏目的，为了使现在还广泛流传的认为科学主要是带来毁灭手段的看法从人们意识中根除出去，为了尽快地应用一切宝贵的可能性促进未来进步而斗争。
    我们协会会章的第一句话就提到协会的主要任务是通过科学知识的应用和发展来提高人类福利，科学可以，而且应该被用于人类福利。我们协会是一个重要的社会因素，它帮助科学家认识到他们在正确地应用科学于进步目的方面，对人类负多么重大的责任。
    我认为，协会对世界许多学者在劳动斗争中给了大力的支持。他们的劳动斗争是为了使科学成果服务于人类和建立幸福的未来。现在，协会已经成立了我们俄文所谓的“肘的感觉”的情况（我不知道其他国家的语言是否有这样的语汇）。这个语汇意味着，当你用你的肘触到站在旁边的人的时候，你就会直接感觉到你在斗争中不是孤独的，感觉到你旁边也有与你同样的为了那些理想，为了使科学为人类造福而斗争的人。初次看来这是一个抽象的感觉却是很现实的和主要的因素，同时这无疑地会成为一个基础，成为解决我们会章中所规定的任务道路上的采取的具体措施的基础。请允许我向我们年青的、正在成长的组织，在它成立十周年的这一天祝贺它在困难的、但是崇高的斗争中获得成就，使科学真正能够仅仅充分地用于世界人民的幸福。
