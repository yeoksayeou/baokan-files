    Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Locust Control Team Plans to Propose Concrete Measures to Eradicate Locust Plagues Within One Year
    Under the leadership of researcher Ma Shijun, the Locust Control Team of the Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, will depart in batches from the 11th to Guangzhou, Hebei, Qinghai and other regions to investigate locust conditions. Within a year, they will propose specific methods to eradicate locust plagues in various migratory locust areas.
    This working group, together with the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute and locust control stations in various provinces, has already proposed methods to eradicate locust plagues after four years of research. Based on the results of this research, various regions across the country have formulated plans to transform the natural environment of locust areas through land reclamation, water level control, water conservancy construction, and changes in farming techniques, with the aim of fundamentally eliminating locust plagues within five years.
    Since the spring of 1952, scientific workers studying locusts have conducted comprehensive investigations in areas with migratory locusts, such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, and have established temporary working stations in Hongze Lake, Weishan Lake, and coastal areas to study the occurrence patterns and hazards of locusts.
    They discovered that land abandonment caused by floods and droughts is the main reason for locust outbreaks. Researchers studied the relationship between water level changes and locust outbreaks in migratory locust areas such as Weishan Lake and found that the rise and fall of locusts are determined by the water level. If the water level is controlled at a certain depth for a month in April and May, the locust eggs will be drowned. In summer, locust eggs can also be drowned as long as the water level is appropriately maintained for ten days. After repeated investigation and research, they proved that lake areas and coastal depressions that frequently suffer from floods and droughts are the main bases for migratory locust outbreaks. This provides a scientific basis for the fundamental cure of locust plagues, which must be combined with the development of water conservancy and agricultural production. They proposed that timely flood storage, water level control, water conservancy construction, and land reclamation can fundamentally eliminate locust habitats. They also cultivated crops such as wheat, sorghum, corn, cotton, and hemp in locust-affected areas, carefully observing their growth in the local area, as well as the feeding, development, and egg-laying of locusts, and found that fiber crops such as cotton and hemp, and oil crops such as peanuts, are not favored by locusts. Therefore, changing plant species in migratory locust areas can also help control locusts.

    科学院昆虫研究所蝗虫工作组计划
    一年内提出根治蝗害的具体办法
    中国科学院昆虫研究所蝗虫工作组在研究员马世骏的领导下，十一日起分批出发到广州、河北、青海等地区调查蝗虫的情况。他们将在一年的时间内，对各种不同飞蝗区分别提出根治蝗害的具体办法。
    这个工作组同华北农业科学研究所、各省蝗虫防治站经过四年的研究，已经提出根治蝗害的办法。现在全国各地根据这个研究的结果制定了垦荒、控制水位、兴修水利、改变耕作技术等改造蝗区自然环境的规划，计划在五年内根本消灭蝗害。
    研究蝗虫的科学工作者从1952年春天以来，先后到江苏、安徽、山东、河北、河南、新疆、内蒙古等有飞蝗的地区作全面调查，并且在洪泽湖、微山湖和沿海地区设立了临时工作站，研究蝗虫的发生规律和危害情况。
    他们发现水灾、旱灾所造成的土地荒芜，是形成蝗虫发生的主要原因。研究人员在微山湖等飞蝗发生地区，研究了水位变化和蝗虫发生的关系，发现蝗虫的消长决定于水位的高低。如果在四、五月间，使水位在一定深度控制一个月，蝗卵就被淹死。在夏天只要水位适当持续十天，也能淹死蝗卵。他们经过反复调查研究，证明经常发生水、旱灾害的湖区和沿海洼地是飞蝗发生的主要基地。这就为根治蝗灾提出必须结合开发水利和发展农业生产的科学根据。他们提出只要适时蓄洪、控制水位，进行水利建设，开垦荒地就能从根本上消灭蝗虫发生地。他们在蝗灾区还栽培了麦子、高粱、玉米、棉、麻等作物，细心地观察这些作物在当地生长，和蝗虫取食、发育、和产卵的情况，发现棉、麻等纤维作物和花生等油料作物都是蝗虫不喜欢吃的。因此在飞蝗发生地区改变植物种类，也能配合灭蝗。
