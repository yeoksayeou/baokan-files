    Lu Xun's Famous Work "Blessing" to be Filmed

    Lu Xun's famous work "Blessing" is about to be brought to the screen. The actors and other personnel making this color film left Beijing for Lu Xun's hometown - Shaoxing, Zhejiang on the 27th to film exterior scenes.

    This film is being produced by the Beijing Film Studio to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death this year. It is written by playwright Xia Yan, directed by Sang Hu, and Bai Yang plays the role of "Xiang Lin's Wife" in the film.

    In this novel, Mr. Lu Xun profoundly depicts the plight of working people and their strong will to struggle in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. Since its publication in 1924, the novel has been loved by the vast number of readers and has been adapted into Pingju opera and other stage performances.

    鲁迅名著“祝福”将摄成影片
    鲁迅的名著“祝福”即将搬上银幕。摄制这部彩色影片的演员和其他人员，二十七日从北京前往鲁迅的故乡——浙江省绍兴拍摄外景。
    这部影片是北京电影制片厂为纪念今年鲁迅逝世二十周年而摄制的。由剧作家夏衍编剧，桑弧导演，白杨扮演剧中的“祥林嫂”。
    鲁迅先生在这篇小说中深刻地描写了半封建半殖民地的社会里，劳动人民被损害的情形和他们的坚强的斗争意志。小说自1924年发表后，立即受到广大读者的热爱，并且曾经改编为评剧等在舞台上上演过。
