The Chengnan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province, was formed by merging sixteen primary cooperatives in the entire township into an advanced cooperative. The entire cooperative had 1,016 households, 6,394.5 mu of land, and 1,274 laborers.

After transitioning to an advanced cooperative, the township and cooperative staff felt that there should be an "advanced" look to it. They proposed the following plan: First, "five transformations": rural urbanization, agricultural collectivization, agricultural semi-mechanization, mountain afforestation, and literacy for young adults. Second, "three no's": no wooden plows, no waterwheels, and no rice threshing tubs. Third, to use the "seven major machines": double-furrow plows, disc harrows, seeders, harvesters, threshing machines, silk reeling machines, and water pumps. They also wanted to greatly develop sideline production, raising dairy cows, sows, chickens, ducks, geese, and so on. Of course, if this plan had been proposed based on the actual situation of the cooperative, it would have been acceptable, but unfortunately, it was not.

How was this plan proposed? This was inseparable from the excessive demands of some business departments in Pingyang County. At that time, many business departments in Pingyang County sent people to this cooperative to establish pilot projects and gather experience. The county supply and marketing cooperative took this cooperative as a base point for experimenting with agricultural semi-mechanization, requiring them to use all new-style farm tools. The cooperative's temporary management committee then signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, stipulating that the agricultural cooperative would purchase 43 double-wheeled double-furrow plows, 1 disc harrow, 3 seeders, 9 harvesters, 33 threshing machines, 17 silk reeling machines, 4 water pumps, and 17 sprayers from the supply and marketing cooperative this year. Staff from the county agricultural bureau told the cooperative to build new-style pigsties, and showed the cooperative staff blueprints, saying, "If you want to raise pigs well, you have to do it this way." Staff from the county culture and education bureau came here to experiment with eliminating illiteracy, proposing "one and a half years of combat, half a year of mopping up," and told the cooperative to quickly install electric lights for the members to learn culture; at that time, it was decided to set up three farmers' spare-time schools and install fifteen electric lights. Staff from the county health department proposed "eliminating diseases within a year and a half," with two health workers and one first-aid kit for every fifty people. At that time, there were many staff, many ideas, and everyone was very enthusiastic, making a lot of noise. Some people worried about where the money would come from to do so many things at once. Staff from the county bank promised full support, saying there were six major loans: poor peasant cooperative fund loans, capital construction loans, extremely poor household loans, agricultural loans, sideline loans, and general revolving loans. The masses reflected: This is great, if we don't have money, we can borrow it from the government. They believed that advanced cooperatives were run with government money and didn't worry about these things not being possible. The cooperative staff were busy planning these tasks, feeling that there were not enough people, and prepared to have nineteen people leave production. In a few days, the cooperative installed seventeen electric lights, and the members reflected, "Socialism has really arrived."

Installing electric lights was just the beginning. To realize that grand plan, a lot of manpower, materials, and financial resources were needed. In terms of financial resources alone, the entire cooperative needed a total of more than 126,000 yuan for capital construction investment and agricultural production expenses, excluding the public ownership share fund. Of this, agricultural production expenses alone would be 75,428 yuan. The cooperative staff originally wanted a state loan for this money, but it was not approved by the higher authorities; they then decided to apportion it among the members based on the work-day base score. The cooperative assessed that each work-day base score should be apportioned 95.9 yuan for the whole year, with 25 yuan in cash to be paid in the first quarter, and the remaining 70.9 yuan to be paid in installments. When this plan was announced to the members, there was a lot of discussion before and after the villages. When meetings were held, the members just complained about the production expenses. Many members' enthusiasm for production declined, and all eight river mud boats in the Fengao and Pingta teams were stopped; those who planned to burn fire mud also stopped. The cooperative staff were at a loss, in a dilemma, some went to their relatives' homes, and some were passive and did not work.

After studying these problems in this cooperative, the Pingyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that the main problem was that the shop was set up too big and must be scaled down to implement the principle of running the cooperative diligently and frugally. The county committee did an accounting for this cooperative, if the cooperative followed the original plan, this year's capital construction investment would be more than 50,000 yuan, agricultural production expenses would be more than 75,000 yuan, and the remuneration for staff detached from production, cooperative affairs expenses, cultural and welfare expenses, etc., would be 18,000 yuan, totaling 38% of the total income. A 40% increase in production was needed to ensure that 90% of the members increased their income. This calculation made the township and cooperative staff sober up. Then, they further calculated the detailed accounts. Even if the cooperative completely abandoned the use of wooden plows (according to the current land conditions in the cooperative, wooden plows could not be completely abandoned), only 34 double-wheeled double-furrow plows would be enough, but the original plan ordered 43. As for blindly engaging in sideline production, the cooperative bought 823 geese, but more than 600 died due to lack of management experience. After this accounting, everyone saw the seriousness of the problem and decided to revise the financial expenditure plan and resolutely implement the principle of running the cooperative diligently and frugally.

First, carry out capital construction according to production needs and economic conditions, doing what is possible. In agriculture, the original plan was to buy four water pumps, but now it was considered that as long as the role of the waterwheels was well utilized, buying one first would be enough; the original plan was to buy 33 threshing machines, but now it was considered that rice threshing tubs could still be used as much as possible, and only ten were bought, to be purchased before the early rice harvest to avoid stockpiling funds. Other plans were also appropriately revised. In terms of sideline production, in addition to stopping the development of those sideline industries that were not yet grasped, the sideline industries that had already been developed, such as collective pig raising, were determined to be done well, but pigsties would not be built for the time being. In this way, a large amount of expenditure was saved.

Second, tap potential and find ways to reduce production costs and reduce the burden on members while ensuring the realization of the target of increasing rice production per mu. The following three measures were taken in this regard: 1. Mobilize members to accumulate more soil fertilizer, and the entire cooperative can buy 60,000 fewer catties of fertilizer. 2. Open up sources of funds, and adopt the principle of "using spring flowers to support early rice, using early rice to support late rice, and using sideline industries to support agriculture." Only 12,200 yuan is needed throughout the year to ensure the realization of the production increase plan. 3. Implement the use and repair of farm tools by the production team, reducing the wear and tear of farm tools.

Third, compress non-productive expenditures as much as possible. The original plan was to set up nineteen cadres detached from production. After repeated study, this was reduced to three people, and two people partially detached from production. Cooperative affairs expenses were also reduced from 0.5% of total income to 0.15%. In addition, other cultural and welfare undertakings are also planned to be developed gradually according to the development of production and the possible conditions within the cooperative. This year, it was decided to retain 2% of total income for public welfare funds and do what needs to be done urgently.

When the members heard this plan, they all expressed their support. Those who were unwilling to invest originally are now actively investing. Many members of the Pingta team voluntarily invested more than 500 yuan. The members' enthusiasm for production has also increased. The Fengao team went to the fields to produce the next day. Currently, each team has a ten-thousand-cattie fertilizer accumulation pit; the entire cooperative has invested in the intense sowing work.

    摆大摊子的教训
    殷惠中
    浙江省平阳县城南农业生产合作社，是合并全乡十六个初级社转成的高级社。全社有1，016户，6，394.5亩田地，1，274个劳力。
    转办高级社以后，乡的工作人员和社的工作人员认为应该有高级社的“派头”，他们提出了这样的计划：一是“五化”：农村城市化，农业集体化，农业半机械化，山上绿化，青壮年有文化。一是“三不用”：木犁不用，水车不用，稻桶不用。一是要用“七大机”：双铧犁，圆盘耙，播种机，收割机，打稻机，刨丝机，抽水机。还要大量发展副业生产，养奶牛、母猪、鸡、鸭、鹅，等等。当然，如果这个计划是根据社里的实际情况提出来的，那是可以的，可惜不是这样的。
    这个计划是怎么提出来的呢？这是跟平阳县一些业务部门的过多的要求分不开的。当时平阳县的许多业务部门都派了人到这个社来搞基点、摸经验。县供销社把这个社作为试验农业半机械化的基点，要求他们全部使用新式农具。社的临时管理委员会便同供销社订立合同，规定农业合作社今年向供销社购买双轮双铧犁四十三部、圆盘耙一部、播种机三部、收割机九部、打稻机三十三部、刨丝机十七部、抽水机四部，还有喷雾器十七付。县农业局的工作人员叫合作社兴建新式猪舍，并且拿了图样给社的工作人员看，说“要想养好猪，就得这样做”。县文教科的工作人员到这里来试验扫除文盲，提出“年半战斗，半年扫尾”，叫合作社赶快装电灯给社员们学文化；当时就决定办三所农民业余学校，装上十五盏电灯。县卫生科工作人员提出“一年半之内消灭疾病”，每五十个人要设二个保健员、一个保健箱。当时工作人员多，主意也多，大家情绪都很高，搞得很热闹。曾有人担心一下子办这么多事，钱从那里来呢？县银行来的工作人员亲口答应大力支持，说有六大贷款：贫农合作基金贷款、基本建设贷款、极贫户贷款、农业贷款、副业贷款、一般的周转性贷款。群众反映：这一下可好了，没有钞票向政府借就是了。他们认为高级社是政府出钱办的，不愁这些事办不到。社的工作人员忙于筹划这些工作，感到人手不足，准备让十九个人脱离生产。没几天工夫，社里就装了十七盏电灯，社员反映：“真是社会主义到了。”
    装电灯，这仅仅是一个开端，要想实现那个庞大的计划，必须要有很大的人力、物力和财力。单就财力一项来说，全社除公有化股份基金外，共需基本建设投资和农业生产费用十二万六千多元。其中农业生产费用一项就要七万五千四百二十八元。这一笔钱，社的工作人员原来也想要国家贷款，但是上级没有批准；他们便决定按劳动日底分由社员分摊。全社评定每个劳动日底分全年应该摊九十五元九角，第一季度要缴纳现金二十五元，还有七十元九角分期缴清。这个方案一向社员公布，村前村后就闹嚷嚷地议论开了。开起会来，社员就是闹生产费用问题。许多社员生产情绪低落，凤岙队和平塔队八只河泥船全部停顿下来；打算烧火泥的也不烧了。社的工作人员束手无策，进退两难，有的到亲戚家里去了，有的情绪消极不做工作。
    中共平阳县委研究了这个社的这些问题以后，认为这个社的缺点主要是摊子摆的太大了，必须把摊子缩小，贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针。县委替这个社算了一笔账，如果这个社按照原来的计划办事，今年基本建设投资要五万多元，农业生产费用七万五千多元，脱离生产人员的报酬、社务开支、文化和福利等费用要一万八千元，合计占总收入38％，要增产40％，才能保证90％的社员增加收入。这样一算，才使乡和社的工作人员清醒过来。于是，他们就进一步算了细账。全社即使全部不用木犁（根据目前社里的地块条件，还不能完全不用木犁），也只要三十四部双轮双铧犁就够了，原计划却订了四十三部。从盲目搞副业来说，这个社买了823只鹅，由于缺乏管理经验，就死了六百多只。经过这样一算账，大家看到了问题的严重性，决定修订财务开支方案，坚决贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针。
    首先，根据生产需要和经济条件，量力而行地进行基本建设。在农业方面，原来打算买四部抽水机，现在认为只要很好地发挥水车的作用，先购一部也就够用了；原计划买三十三部打稻机，现在认为仍然可以尽量利用稻桶，只买十部，准备在早稻登场前再购买，以免积压资金。对其它计划也适当作了修改。在副业方面，除了停止发展那些现在还没有把握的副业外，已经发展起来的副业，如集体养猪等，下决心搞好，但是暂时不兴建猪舍。这样一来，就节省了很大一笔支出。
    其次，挖潜力、找窍门。在保证实现每亩水稻增产指标的前提下，合理降低生产成本，减少社员负担。在这方面采取了以下三个措施：一、发动社员多积土肥，全社可以少买肥田粉六万斤。二、开辟资金来源，采取“以春花养早稻，以早稻养晚稻，以副业扶农业”的方针，全年只要一万二千二百元，就可以保证增产计划的实现。三、实行农具由生产队包用包修，减少农具损耗。
    第三，尽量压缩非生产性的开支。原来打算设脱离生产的干部十九人，经过反复研究，减少为三人，半脱离生产的二人。社务开支也由原来占总收入0.5％减少为0.15％。此外，其它文化福利事业也准备根据生产发展和社内可能条件逐步发展。今年决定留公益金占总收入2％，先办急需办的事。
    社员们一听到这个方案，都表示拥护。原来不愿投资的，现在都积极投资，平塔队有很多社员，自愿投资超额五百多元。社员的生产积极性也高涨起来了。凤岙队第二天全部下田生产。目前，队队都有了万斤积肥坑；全社都投入了紧张的播种工作。
