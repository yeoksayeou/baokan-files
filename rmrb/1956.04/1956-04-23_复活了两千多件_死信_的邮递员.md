    Postman Who Revived Over Two Thousand Pieces of "Dead Letter" Mail
    Xu Hongjiang, an old deliveryman from the Shantou City Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, has been selected as a representative to attend the National Conference of Advanced Postal and Telecommunications Producers. Since 1951, Xu Hongjiang has revived 2,246 pieces of "dead letter" mail and has created a set of experiences for reviving "dead letter" mail, such as the "Door Number Transformation Method," the "Address Character Inference Method," and the "Find a Colleague Method." Because of the revival of "dead letter" mail, many relatives who had been out of touch for many years were reunited or reconnected. Once, a "dead letter" he revived enabled an old woman surnamed Chen to reconnect with her daughter, from whom she had not heard for more than ten years. Xu Hongjiang also assisted the Bank of China's branch in Shantou and some overseas Chinese remittance agencies in delivering many "undeliverable" overseas remittances and letters to the recipients.
    Xu Hongjiang is fifty-three years old this year. He has been a deliveryman in the Shantou City postal and telecommunications department since he was eighteen years old, and has recently been promoted to Deputy Section Chief of the Delivery Section.

    复活了两千多件“死信”的邮递员
    汕头市邮电局的老投递员许鸿江，被评选为出席全国邮电先进生产者代表会议的代表。许鸿江从1951年到现在复活了2，246件“死信”，并且创造了“门牌号码变换法”、“地址字样推测法”、“找同行法”等一套复活“死信”的经验。由于“死信”复活，使许多多年音信不通的亲人得到团聚或是恢复了联系。有一次，他复活的一封“死信”，使一个姓陈的老太太因此和她的十多年没有通音讯的女儿恢复了联系。许鸿江还协助中国银行在汕头市的分支机构和一些侨批局，把许多“无法投递”的侨汇、侨批送给受款人。
    许鸿江今年五十三岁了。他从十八岁就在汕头市邮电部门当投递员，近来已经被提拔为投递科副科长。
