    Guangzhou swimming season has begun.
    The Guangzhou West Suburb People's Swimming Pool, located on the banks of the Lychee Bay River, a tributary of the Pearl River, welcomed its first swimmers of the year on April 1st.
    The Liwan, West Suburb, and Youth swimming pools in Guangzhou, which originally could accommodate more than 10,000 people, have not only expanded the swimming pools and water polo practice pools this year but also added ball courts, swings, and wave bridges. It is estimated that the city's swimming venues can accommodate 80,000 to 90,000 people swimming at the same time. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    广州游泳季节开始
    广州市的游泳季节开始了。
