Xinhua News Agency, April 1st, dispatch from New York, March 31st, TASS: "New York Times" Washington diplomatic correspondent Reston commented on the recent summit of the heads of government of the United States, Canada, and Mexico held in White Sulphur Springs, saying that the United States and Canada have differences of opinion on the issue of recognizing the People's Republic of China.

    Reston said that Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, in a private meeting with Eisenhower and Dulles, said that, given Canadian public opinion, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Canadian government to agree with the policy of recognizing the Chiang Kai-shek regime in Taiwan.

    Canadians say they are concerned that this policy will inevitably encounter increasing difficulties. They said that more and more countries are increasingly disobeying the United States' leadership on this issue.

    Reston said that Canadians also took the opportunity to remind Eisenhower and Dulles that "certain aspects of the United States' control over Canada's economy" are causing "increasing anti-American sentiment" "within Canada."

    美加在承认中国问题上有分歧
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社纽约3月31日讯：“纽约时报”驻华盛顿外交记者赖斯顿评论最近在怀特矿泉城举行的美国、加拿大和墨西哥三国政府首脑会议说，美国同加拿大在承认中华人民共和国的问题上存在着分歧。
    赖斯顿说，加拿大外交部长皮尔逊在同艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯举行的一次私下会谈中说，鉴于加拿大的舆论，加拿大政府越来越难于赞同承认台湾的蒋介石政权的政策。
    加拿大人说，他们担心，这种政策将不可避免地遭到越来越大的困难。他们说，越来越多的国家越来越不服从美国在这个问题上的领导。
    赖斯顿说，加拿大人也趁这个机会提醒艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯说：“美国对加拿大的经济的某些方面的控制”在“加拿大国内”引起“越来越强烈的反美情绪”。
