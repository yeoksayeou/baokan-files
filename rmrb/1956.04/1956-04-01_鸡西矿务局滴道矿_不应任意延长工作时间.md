Jixi Mining Bureau Didao Mine
Should Not Arbitrarily Extend Working Hours

To the Editor:
    The Didao Mine of the Jixi Mining Bureau frequently and arbitrarily extends the working hours of its workers. From December of last year to January 13th of this year, at the No. 3 mine, 339 workers had their working hours extended by 2,715 hours, with the longest underground shift reaching sixteen hours. At the No. 8 mine, 454 people had their working hours extended by 3,635 hours. At the No. 2 mine, in just twelve days from January 1st to January 12th of this year, workers' hours were extended by 480 hours.

    The main reason for this phenomenon is that the leadership of the Didao Mine has failed to strengthen technical management and solve transportation equipment problems in line with the increase in production tasks. None of the eleven electric locomotives in the mine meet the standards, resulting in frequent accidents. The transportation equipment cannot circulate normally, production is affected, and underground workers have to extend their working hours. This problem has long been a major concern for all employees of the mine, but the leadership has not been able to solve it well.

    It is hoped that the leadership of the Jixi Mining Bureau will quickly assist the Didao Mine in strengthening production and transportation management and solving the problem of insufficient transportation equipment.

    鸡西矿务局滴道矿
    不应任意延长工作时间编辑同志：
    鸡西矿务局滴道矿经常任意延长工人的工作时间。从去年十二月到今年一月十三日，在三井有339个工人延长了工作时间2，715小时，在井下工作最长的达到十六小时；八井有454人延长工作时间3，635小时。二井仅在今年一月一日到十二日的十二天中，就延长工人工作时间480小时。
    造成这种现象的原因，主要是滴道矿的领导方面没有随着生产任务的提高来加强技术管理工作和解决运输设备问题。这个矿的十一台电车头中没有一台是合乎标准的，因而经常发生事故。运输工具不能正常地周转，生产受到了影响，井下的工人们就得延长工作时间。这个问题很久以来就是全矿职工最担心的一个大问题，可是领导方面一直没有很好加以解决。
    希望鸡西矿务局领导方面迅速协助滴道矿加强生产运输管理工作，解决运输设备不足的问题。　蓝天
