Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, N.S. Khrushchev, with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Anthony Eden, was signed at the British Foreign Office.

The statement was signed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N.A. Bulganin, on behalf of the Soviet Government, and by Prime Minister Eden on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom.

After the signing, Bulganin, Eden, Lloyd, and Khrushchev shook hands.

Present at the signing were senior Soviet and British government officials, as well as news, radio, and film documentary personnel from Britain and abroad.

Xinhua News Agency, London, April 27th (via TASS): The full text of the statement of the talks between Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N.A. Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, N.S. Khrushchev, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Anthony Eden, is as follows:

From April 18th to April 27th, 1956, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N.A. Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, N.S. Khrushchev, visited the United Kingdom at the invitation of Her Majesty's Government. During their stay, they held a series of talks with Prime Minister of United Kingdom, Sir Anthony Eden, the Lord Privy Seal, Mr. R.A. Butler, the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, and other members of Her Majesty's Government on Anglo-Soviet relations and the overall international situation. These talks were conducted in a spirit of frankness and realism. The talks covered most of the current international issues of concern, and they exchanged views fully and fruitfully.

The representatives of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom recognized that strengthening relations between the two countries in the political, trade, scientific, cultural and other fields is in the interests of the peoples of both countries. They also firmly believe that this will help to consolidate universal peace and security.

They expressed their governments' determination to strive for further relaxation of international tension. Given the current lack of necessary trust between countries, they expressed their determination to take all possible measures to promote the strengthening of mutual trust and improve relations between countries. They recognized that one of the important factors in strengthening international trust is personal contact between national leaders, which has produced positive results.

Both countries will be guided by the principles of the United Nations in their relations with each other and with other countries. They are convinced that the basis for the friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence of all countries—regardless of their social systems—is respect for the independence and sovereignty of states, territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

They will do their utmost to end the arms race in all parts of the world, thereby freeing the peoples of the world from the threat of a new war.

The representatives of both countries attached particular importance to maintaining security in Europe, and they are convinced that peace and security in Europe are of decisive importance for maintaining world peace. However, no understanding was reached on the methods of achieving this goal.

Regarding other unresolved international issues on which views were exchanged, including issues in Europe and Asia, both sides will strive to promote their resolution in the interests of consolidating universal peace.

The representatives of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom reached the following conclusions on certain individual issues discussed by both sides:

	Near and Middle East
The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom are firmly willing to do everything possible to promote the maintenance of peace and security in the Near and Middle East. To this end, they give necessary support to the efforts of the United Nations to strengthen peace in the Palestine region and to implement the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.

Both governments believe that effective measures to achieve the above objectives should be taken in the near future in accordance with the national aspirations of the peoples of the countries concerned, in accordance with the need to guarantee their independence, and fully in accordance with the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter.

Both governments call on the countries concerned to take measures to prevent the aggravation of tension in the areas demarcated under the relevant armistice agreements between Israel and the Arab countries.

They will also support initiatives taken by the United Nations to seek a peaceful resolution of disputes between Arab countries and Israel on a basis acceptable to both parties.

They recognize the importance of the refugee problem and will therefore support United Nations actions to alleviate the plight of refugees.

Both governments express their strong hope that other countries will also do everything possible to assist the United Nations in achieving a peaceful resolution of disputes between Arab countries and Israel, thereby strengthening peace and security in the Near and Middle East.

	Disarmament
During the exchange of views, the issue of disarmament was discussed. The representatives of both countries reviewed the progress made in discussions in the United Nations and the proposals made by the countries concerned. Both sides agreed that the resolution of this issue would be of extremely great significance for maintaining universal peace.

The Government of the Soviet Union and the Government of the United Kingdom attach great importance to the conclusion of an appropriate international agreement on this issue. Such an agreement will help to ease international tensions, strengthen trust between countries and reduce the burden of military expenditure.

Both governments agree that it is extremely important to save mankind from the threat of nuclear war. Their common goal remains the final prohibition of nuclear weapons and the complete use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and they will continue to make efforts to achieve this goal.

The Soviet and United Kingdom governments recognize the need to reach an agreement to begin without delay practical measures for substantial reductions in the armed forces of all countries (and correspondingly reduce their armaments) under appropriate international supervision, starting with reductions by the five major powers.

Both governments will continue to make efforts in the United Nations and the Disarmament Subcommittee to promote the necessary understanding between the countries concerned on this issue.

Development of Soviet-British Trade Relations
The issue of further developing trade between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom was also discussed.

The representatives of both countries agreed that the development of trade between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom could make an important contribution to closer relations between the two countries. This will help promote a more rational utilization of the productive potential of both countries and will promote trade between East and West.

During the discussions, the Soviet representatives stated that the Soviet government wished to greatly expand trade with the United Kingdom. The British representatives also stated that they hoped that such trade would be expanded. The Soviet representatives stated that, in the absence of trade restrictions or discrimination, the Soviet Union could increase its purchases of goods from the United Kingdom to approximately 9 billion to 11 billion rubles, or 800 million to 1 billion pounds sterling, in the next five years from 1956 to 1960, including orders for various equipment and ships for approximately 4 billion to 5 billion rubles and purchases of various industrial goods and raw materials for 5 billion to 6 billion rubles. A detailed and comprehensive list of machinery, equipment, and ships that Soviet organizations could order from the United Kingdom has been provided to the United Kingdom representatives.

The representatives of the United Kingdom pointed out that some of the goods on this list are subject to current strategic controls. Nevertheless, a large portion of the goods and raw materials on this list are unrestricted, and therefore there is room for increased trade.

The representatives of the Soviet government pointed out that increasing Soviet orders for machinery, equipment, and ships in the United Kingdom, as well as increasing purchases of raw materials and industrial products, would necessitate that they correspondingly develop their exports to increase their sterling earnings, and the representatives of the United Kingdom pointed out that the United Kingdom market is open to many types of Soviet exports.

In view of the above considerations, the representatives of both governments agreed that the above list should be further studied by the British side with the assistance of Soviet technical experts.

They also agreed to further study the issue of exchanging consumer goods and facilitating contacts between buyers and sellers.

Cultural and Other Ties
The Soviet and United Kingdom representatives also discussed the issue of strengthening cultural and other ties. They adopted a joint declaration on this issue, which is published separately as an annex.

Annex: Joint Declaration on Further Development of Ties between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom

The heads of government of the Soviet Union and the heads of government of the United Kingdom, during the visit of N.A. Bulganin and N.S. Khrushchev to the United Kingdom, after exchanging views, reached the following agreement:

1. They noted with satisfaction that the relationship between the two countries has achieved certain achievements in cultural, scientific and technological ties. Both sides have made mutual visits by government, municipal, scientific and cultural delegations, as well as theater troupes, musicians and sports delegations.

2. They consider it appropriate for the governments of both countries to give citizens of each country all assistance to enable them to understand the experience and achievements of the other country in literature, painting and sculpture, drama, music, film, radio and television, as well as in science, technology, education and health.

3. They agree to increase various exchanges between art, technology, science, and sports groups on a reciprocal basis, with representatives selected from the best talents that both countries can provide; and to send qualified students to study in universities in the other country on a reciprocal basis.

4. They hope to encourage the exchange of information between the major research institutions, specialized institutions and scientific institutions of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, and hope to increase the exchange of scientific, technological and cultural publications between the two countries.

5. They hope to increase individual and collective visits by Soviet citizens to the United Kingdom and individual and collective visits by citizens of the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union. Both governments will provide all possible assistance to implement these measures, in particular to create more favorable economic conditions.

6. In order to enhance the mutual understanding that these exchanges are intended to promote, they agree to provide all opportunities for the Soviet people and the people of the United Kingdom to understand each other's views and ways of life. To achieve this goal, they will take practical steps to ensure a freer exchange of information, either orally or in writing.

    苏英发表会谈声明和宣言
    新华社27日讯  据塔斯社伦敦二十六日讯：四月二十六日当地时间二十三点，在英国外交部签署了关于苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫同联合王国首相艾登爵士的会谈的声明。
    代表苏联政府签字的是苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，代表联合王国政府签字的是艾登首相。
    在签字后，布尔加宁、艾登、劳埃德和赫鲁晓夫相互握手。
    在签字的时候，在场的有苏联和英国的高级政府人员，英国和外国的新闻、广播和电影纪录人员。
    新华社27日讯  塔斯社伦敦二十七日讯：苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同联合王国首相安东尼·艾登爵士会谈的声明，全文如下：
    从1956年4月18日到4月27日，苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫应女王政府的邀请访问了联合王国。在他们逗留期间，他们同联合王国首相安东尼·艾登爵士、掌玺大臣理·奥·巴特勒先生、外交大臣塞尔温·劳埃德先生和女王政府的其他成员就英苏关系和整个国际局势举行了一系列的会谈。这些会谈是由双方抱着坦率和现实主义的精神进行的。这些会谈涉及了大部分当前大家关心的国际问题，他们并且充分地和有益地交换了意见。
    苏联和联合王国的代表认识到，加强英苏两国在政治、贸易、科学、文化和其他方面的关系是符合两国人民的利益的。他们也深信，这将有助于巩固普遍的和平和安全。
    他们表示他们的政府决心为争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势而努力。鉴于目前国与国之间没有必要的信任的这种情况，他们表示他们决心要采取一切可能的措施来促进加强相互之间的信任和改善国与国之间的关系。他们认识到，加强国际信任的重要因素之一是国家领导人之间的亲自接触，这种接触已经产生了积极的结果。
    两国在它们相互之间的关系以及它们与其他国家的关系方面将以联合国的原则为指针。他们确信一切国家——不论它们的社会制度怎样——的友好合作和和平共处的基础是尊重国家的独立和主权、领土完整和不干涉其他国家的内政。
    他们将尽他们最大的力量来结束世界各个部分的军备竞赛，从而使世界各国人民摆脱新战争的威胁。
    两国代表特别重视维持欧洲的安全，他们确信，欧洲的和平和安全对保持世界和平有着决定性的重要意义。但是在实现这个目的的方法方面没有达成谅解。
    关于双方交换过意见的其他没有解决的国际问题，包括欧洲和亚洲的问题，双方为了巩固普遍和平的利益，将努力促进它们的解决。
    苏联和联合王国的代表就双方讨论过的某些个别问题得出了下列结论：
        近东和中东
    苏联和联合王国坚定地愿意尽一切力量促进维护近东和中东的和平和安全。为了这个目的，它们对联合国加强巴勒斯坦地区的和平和执行安全理事会相应的决定的努力给予必要的支持。
    两国政府认为应该根据有关国家人民的民族愿望、根据保证它们的独立的必要性、并且完全按照联合国宪章所提出的原则，在最近的将来采取达到上述目标的有效措施。
    两国政府要求有关国家采取措施以防止根据以色列和阿拉伯国家之间有关的停战协定而建立的分界线地区内紧张局势的加剧。
    它们还将支持联合国采取首创行动在双方都可接受的基础上谋求阿拉伯国家和以色列之间的争端的和平解决。
    它们认识到难民问题的重要性，因此将支持联合国采取的减轻难民的困苦的行动。
    两国政府表示这种强烈的希望：其他国家也将尽一切可能来协助联合国获致阿拉伯国家和以色列之间的争端的和平解决，从而加强近东和中东的和平和安全。
        裁军问题
    在交换意见的过程中，曾经讨论了裁军问题。两国代表审查了在联合国进行的讨论所达到的情况和有关国家提出的建议。双方一致认为，这个问题的解决对于维护普遍和平将具有极为重大的意义。
    苏联政府和联合王国政府非常重视就这个问题缔结一项适当的国际协定。这样一项协定将有助于缓和国际紧张局势，加强国与国之间的信任和减轻军事开支的负担。
    两国政府一致认为拯救人类免于核子战争的威胁是极其重要的。它们的共同目标仍然是最后禁止核子武器和把核子能完全用于和平用途，它们将继续进行努力来实现这个目的。
    苏联和联合王国政府承认有必要达成一项协议来毫不拖延地开始在适当的国际监督下对各国武装部队采取大量裁减（相应地裁减它们的军备）的实际措施，而以五大国的裁减作为开始。
    两国政府将继续进行努力，在联合国和裁军小组委员会中促进有关国家就这个问题达成必要的谅解。
    发展苏英贸易关系
    关于进一步发展苏联和联合王国之间的贸易的问题也进行了讨论。
    两国代表一致认为，发展苏联和联合王国之间的贸易能够对两国的更密切的关系作出重要的贡献。这将有助于促进更合理地利用它们两国的生产潜能，并且将会推动东西方之间的贸易。
    在讨论过程中，苏联代表声明，苏联政府愿望大大扩大同联合王国的贸易。英国代表也声明，他们希望这种贸易得到扩大。苏联代表们声明，如果没有贸易限制或歧视，苏联在1956—1960年的今后五年中向联合王国购买的货物可以增加到大约九十亿到一百一十亿卢布之多，即八亿到十亿英镑，包括对各种装备和船只的订货大约四十亿到五十亿卢布和购买各种工业物品和原料五十亿到六十亿卢布。苏联的机构可以向联合王国订购的机器、装备和船只的一份详尽全面的货单已经交给了联合王国代表。
    联合王国的代表指出，这份货单中的一部分货物是属于目前的战略管制之列的。尽管如此，这份货单中很大一部分货物和原料是不受限制的，因此存在着增加贸易的余地。
    苏联政府的代表指出，增加苏联在联合王国购买机器、装备和船只的订货以及增加购买原料和工业品的数量就有必要使他们相应地发展他们的出口以增加他们的英镑收入，而联合王国代表指出，对于苏联的很多种类的出口货，联合王国的市场是开放的。
    两国政府代表鉴于上述考虑，一致同意上述货单应该由英国方面在苏联技术专家的协助下予以进一步的研究。
    他们还一致同意要进一步研究交换消费品和便利买卖双方的联系的问题。
    文化联系和其他联系
    苏联和联合王国代表还讨论了加强文化联系和其他联系问题。他们就这个问题通过了一项联合宣言，这个宣言作为附件另行发表。

  附件  关于进一步发展苏联和联合王国的联系的联合宣言

    五、他们希望增加苏联公民对联合王国的个别和集体访问和联合王国公民对苏联的个别和集体访问。两国政府将提供一切可能的协助以便实施这些措施，特别是要创造更有利的经济条件。
    六、为了增进这些交流所要促进的相互谅解，他们同意向苏联人民和联合王国人民提供一切机会来了解彼此的见解和生活方式。为了达到这个目的，他们将采取切实可行的步骤以保证更自由地通过口头或文字交换情报。
