Why are there fewer and fewer activists in cooperatives?
    Liang Guangjing

    On March 5th, the Party branch of Dongdang Township, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, convened a meeting of several Party members who held leadership positions in advanced cooperatives. Before the meeting, while waiting for everyone to arrive, they began to chat idly. Deng Dayuan, a member of the branch committee, as if suddenly reminded of something, stood up and said to everyone: "Our Caijia Advanced Cooperative was established very smoothly, and after its establishment, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high, and the achievements in production were also great. However, now it seems that there is a major problem, which is that not only have activists not increased, but they have decreased. The higher-ups often tell us that we should cultivate and develop a group of activists through every movement. With activists, we can broadly connect with the masses and do our work well. We didn't achieve this during this transition to advanced cooperatives. What is the reason for this?" This fresh and practical question immediately aroused everyone's interest, and they all spoke on this issue.

    Yan Danan, the deputy director of the Jiangpu Agricultural Cooperative, said: "That's right, this problem does exist. As the cooperative gets bigger, the number of activists decreases. Our Chiyu Village was originally a primary cooperative, and it had four squad leaders, four deputy squad leaders, and four work recorders, all of whom were activists. After merging into the advanced cooperative, our primary cooperative became a production team, and the original four squads were reorganized into two squads. As a result, some people no longer served as squad leaders and work recorders. The cooperative management committee neither assigned these activists who no longer held the positions of squad leader and work recorder any specific work, nor did it explain to them the reasons why they should not continue to serve as squad leaders and work recorders. As a result, their morale immediately declined, and they even developed unnecessary doubts about the Party organization. The reduction of activists in the team also led to some difficulties in leading production. How should this problem be solved? It is indeed worthy of attention."

    Wang Youkai, who was originally the head of the Baitadong Cooperative and is now the director of finance and grain of the Caijia Agricultural Cooperative, said: "When our Baitadong Cooperative merged with the Baitaxi Cooperative last winter to form a larger primary cooperative, it was the same. There were more activists originally, but once we merged, the number of activists decreased. Zhou Shuyin, a poor peasant activist, was a bit older and was originally a squad leader in the Baitadong Cooperative. After the merger, he was no longer asked to be a squad leader, but it was not explained to him why. One day he came to me and asked: 'Head, why don't you want me to be a squad leader anymore?' This question stumped me, and I couldn't say why I didn't want him to be a squad leader for a while."

    Everyone said almost in unison: "This poor peasant activist's question makes sense! Why don't you want him to be a squad leader?"

    Branch Committee Member Deng Dayuan added: "Take our village as an example. The original small cooperative of twenty-eight households had two directors and deputy directors, seven committee members, a financial accountant, a work recorder, and four squad leaders and deputy squad leaders, a total of fifteen people. Now a squad has more than twenty households, which is equivalent to a small cooperative in the past, but now a squad can only have four or five cadres at most. This means that more than ten of the original backbone members cannot be cadres anymore. Not being a cadre is not the main problem. The serious thing is that they are not treated as activists, and we don't rely on them for work. How can this not dampen their morale and frustrate their enthusiasm!"

    Everyone agreed with this opinion and unanimously believed that these original backbone members of the primary cooperatives should be called together for a meeting to explain the situation, clarify the principles, continue to cultivate them, and rely on them.

    From this conversation among the responsible cadres of the township's advanced cooperative, a noteworthy problem is indeed exposed. Is this kind of problem only present in this township? No, from what I understand, there are similar situations in other places. The larger the cooperative, the fewer the activists. This shows that some rural Party members and Party organizations have adopted an incorrect attitude towards activists, assigning them work when needed and abandoning them when not needed. Of course, the number of cadres doing leadership work should and must be reduced after small cooperatives merge into large cooperatives. After small cooperatives merge into large cooperatives, some of the cadres of the original small cooperatives will no longer be responsible for the administrative work of the cooperative. The question is how we deal with this problem: do we abandon them without asking, frustrating their enthusiasm, or do we explain the principles to them and continue to cultivate and develop their enthusiasm? After small cooperatives merge into large cooperatives, and after primary cooperatives transform into advanced cooperatives, the work tasks become more arduous. Only by relying on activists and uniting the broad masses can we run the cooperatives well. And those who have served as cadres of primary cooperatives have already been cultivated by the Party and have been tempered by work, and should be the most reliable activists. How can we casually abandon them?

    I believe that local rural grassroots Party organizations should examine this aspect of their work. If this shortcoming or error has not yet occurred, they should be vigilant and prevent it. If this shortcoming or error has already occurred, they should study and correct it. And the county and district Party committees should also check this aspect of the work and specifically help the grassroots Party organizations do a good job in using and cultivating backbone members and activists.

    为什么合作社里的积极分子愈来愈少
    梁光景
    三月五日，江苏省昆山县东荡乡党支部，召集几个在高级合作社中担任领导工作的党员开会。会前，由于人还没有到齐，大家就闲谈起来。支部委员邓大元好像突然想起了什么问题似的，站起来对大家说：“我们蔡家高级社成立的时候是很顺利的，成立以后，群众的情绪很高涨，生产上的成绩也很巨大，但是现在看起来，有一个大毛病，就是积极分子不但没有增加，反而减少了。上级经常对我们说：每通过一个运动都要培养发展一批积极分子。有了积极分子，才能广泛地联系群众，才能把工作做好。这次转高级社中，就没有做到这一点，这是什么原因呢？”这个新鲜而又实际的问题，立刻引起了大家的兴趣，都围绕着这个问题发言了。
    江浦农业合作社的副主任严大男说：“不错，就是存在这个问题，社办大了，积极分子倒减少了。我们池鱼村原来是一个初级社，就有四个小队长，四个小队副，还有四个记工员，都是积极分子。合并到高级社以后，我们这个初级社就变成一个生产中队，把原来的四个小队编成了两个小队，这样，有的人就不再当小队长和记工员了。对这些没有继续担任小队长和记工员职务的积极分子，社务管理委员会既没有分配他们一定的工作，也没有向他们说明不要他们继续担任小队长和记工员的理由。于是，他们的情绪马上低落下来，甚至对党组织产生了不必要的怀疑。而中队里边由于积极分子的减少，在领导生产上也就发生了一些困难，这个问题应该怎样解决，的确值得注意。”
    原来是白塔东社社长现在是蔡家农业合作社财粮主任的王友凯说：“当我们白塔东社在去年冬天和白塔西社合并成一个较大的初级社的时候，也是这样，原来积极分子较多，一并，积极分子就减少了。贫农积极分子周树银，年龄较大一点，原是白塔东社的一个小队长。并社之后，就不要他做小队长了，但是也没和他说清楚是为什么。一天他跑来问我：‘社长，为什么不要我当小队长了？’这一问可把我问住了，一时也说不上不要他当小队长的理由来。”
    大家几乎是异口同声地说：“这个贫农积极分子问的有道理！为什么不要他当小队长呢？”
    支部委员邓大元又说道：“就拿我们村子来说，原来二十八户的一个小社，就有正副社长二人、社务委员七人，还有财务会计、记工会计各一人，正副小队长四人，共十五人。现在一个小队的户数就有二十多，抵得从前一个小社，而现在一个小队最多也只能有四、五个干部，这就是说还有十多个原来的骨干分子不能当干部了。不当干部不要紧，严重的是，没有把他们当做积极分子看待，工作上不去依靠他们。这怎么能不打击他们的情绪，挫折他们的积极性呢！”
    大家都同意这个意见，一致认为应该把这些原来是初级社的骨干分子，召集起来开一次会，说明情况，讲清道理，继续培养他们，依靠他们。
    从这个乡高级合作社的负责干部的闲谈中，的确暴露了一个值得重视的问题。难道这样的问题只有这个乡存在吗？不，据我了解，在其他地方也有类似的情况，合作社愈大，积极分子却愈来愈少。这说明某些农村党员和党组织对待积极分子采取了不正确的态度，工作需要的时候就给他们分配工作，工作不需要的时候就把他们丢在一边。当然，小社并成大社以后，做领导工作的干部当然要减少，也应该减少。小社并入大社以后，原来小社的干部中就有一些不会再担负合作社的行政工作。问题是在于我们怎样对待这一问题，是把他们丢在一边不闻不问，挫折他们的积极性呢？还是对他们讲清道理，继续培养和发挥他们的积极性呢？小社并成大社以后，初级社转成高级社以后，工作任务更加繁重，只有依靠积极分子和团结广大群众，才能办好合作社。而原来当过初级社干部的这些人，已经经过党的培养，受过工作的锻炼，应该是最可靠的积极分子。怎么能把他们随便丢开呢？
    我认为，各地农村基层党组织应该检查一下这方面的工作，如果还没有产生这种缺点和错误，应该警惕和防止。如果已经有了这种缺点和错误，就要研究和纠正。而县委和区委也应该去检查这一方面的工作情况，具体帮助基层党组织把使用和培养骨干分子和积极分子的工作做好。
