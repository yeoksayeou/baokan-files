    An Excellent Female Director of a Coking Workshop
    Xiao Ming
    In the Second Coking Workshop of the Chemical Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, there is a young woman who looks very simple and speaks with a Sichuan accent. She stands beside the giant, flame-spewing, towering coke ovens, skillfully directing the production of this workshop. Here, whether they are veteran workers with thirty years of experience or young workers with shorter tenures, they all work with her with respect and affection. This young woman is the director of this workshop – Tang Sixiao.
    Six years ago, Tang Sixiao was just a student who had just graduated from Sichuan University. Although she studied chemistry, she didn't know what a coke oven looked like. But now, she is already an excellent director of a coking workshop.
    In May 1950, Tang Sixiao came to Anshan Iron and Steel from Chengdu. When she first stood beside the tall coke oven, looking up at the red-hot coke pouring out of the towering oven, her heart burned like the coke. She stood beside the tall coke oven for a long time, feeling excited. From that moment on, she fell in love with coking work.
    When the leaders of the factory asked Tang Sixiao for her opinion on job assignments, she unhesitatingly requested to be sent to the coking workshop of the Chemical Plant. At that time, there had never been a female comrade in the coking workshop. When Tang Sixiao started working on the coke oven, many workers looked at her with surprise. Some workers secretly laughed at this young female university student, saying, "Even the young men are roasted enough on this coke oven, can you, a girl, endure it?" The old workers on the furnace also said, "Since the puppet Manchuria regime, I have never seen a woman on a coke oven. Female comrades should just sit in the office and write and calculate." However, all of this did not make Tang Sixiao lose confidence. She firmly believed that she could master coking technology. From the first day of work, she went early and left late every day, and even went to the coke oven on Sundays. During her apprenticeship, the factory leaders knew that she could work hard and study diligently, so they encouraged her to get closer to the workers and learn operating techniques and production experience from them.
    In her work, she felt that she knew too little about coke ovens. In the hot summer, Tang Sixiao worked with the workers on and off the furnace every day. The scorching furnace and the gas-filled soot sometimes made her dizzy, and sweat soaked through her shirt and into her thick canvas overalls, but she was not completely scorched by the coke oven. She gradually became familiar with the workers. When she saw the master workers cleaning the furnace body, she rushed to help. The old workers saw that this university student worked like them, without any airs, and they kindly told her their decades of operating experience, becoming her best teachers in practical work.
    After the six-month apprenticeship period was over, she was officially assigned to the No. 8 and No. 9 coke ovens to be responsible for the production technology work of the two furnaces.
    The No. 8 and No. 9 furnaces were both pieced together with old materials during the puppet Manchuria regime, and had many problems, often producing defective products during production. Other furnaces could coke in sixteen hours, but these two furnaces needed eighteen hours to coke, and the coke produced was often half-baked. Bearing the responsibility for the production technology of these two furnaces was no easy task! This young woman was really a little anxious. For several nights she couldn't sleep, always thinking about how to improve production and enable these two old furnaces to produce normally. She knew that many old workers were very familiar with these two furnaces, so she humbly asked these workers for advice. Master Jiang Shouwei, who had more than thirty years of experience in watching the fire, was most familiar with the problems of these two furnaces. At first, Master Jiang didn't think much of this young woman. Tang Sixiao was not discouraged, she tried to get closer to Master Jiang, and whenever she had time, she would ask Master Jiang for advice. In this way, she not only gained a further understanding of the history of the No. 8 and No. 9 coke ovens and the root causes of these two old furnaces from Master Jiang, but also changed Master Jiang's view of her.
    After she figured out the problems of the coke ovens, she began to study how to repair them, and where to repair them first. She considered it for a long time, but never dared to make a final decision. At this time, Soviet experts came to understand the production situation of these two coke ovens. After careful inspection, the Soviet experts pointed out that the furnace had leaked and needed to be repaired first, which was a great inspiration to Tang Sixiao. In order to repair these leaks, she came up with a method of sticking some cut paper strips to the outside of the furnace wall. If the paper strips were sucked onto the furnace wall, it would prove that there was a leak there. When she led some bricklayers to stick paper strips, sure enough, thousands of paper strips were sucked onto the furnace wall, making it easy to find the leaks. At first, the bricklayers responsible for repairing the leaks were a little annoyed, saying that what did it matter if such a large furnace leaked a little? Tang Sixiao knew in her heart that without repairing the furnace body, the furnace temperature would not be normal and the quality of coking would not be improved. She explained these principles to the bricklayers and personally stood with them in high places to fill each small crack with refractory mud. After months of efforts by her and the workers, the leaks in the furnace were finally repaired, and the coke produced was no longer half-baked.
    After the furnace seams were repaired, the quality of coking was improved, but she found that the furnace temperature could not be maintained evenly and normally, and the coking time could not catch up with other coke ovens. At this time, Tang Sixiao patiently found the workers to study together. The workers said that the gas pipeline was blocked and suggested cleaning it. She accepted their suggestion and carefully checked the gas pipeline again, proving that the workers' suggestion was completely correct.
    Cleaning the gas pipeline was hard work. At that time, it was June, and it was already hot enough next to the coke oven, let alone crawling into those unventilated, hot gas pipelines to clean. But Tang Sixiao decided that no matter how difficult it was, she would take the lead in completing this task. Because she was able to get along with the workers on weekdays, she was loved by the workers. Under her leadership, many workers went into the pipeline. While cleaning the pipeline, she carefully checked whether the pipeline had any leaks. Although her whole body was soaked with sweat, and the choking soot sometimes made her unable to breathe, she persevered and endured. Many workers were moved by her hard-working and responsible work spirit. They successfully completed the cleaning work. The furnace temperature quickly remained normal and stable, the gas consumption was also significantly reduced, and the coking time caught up with other coke ovens.
    In the major repairs of the No. 8 and No. 9 coke ovens, Tang Sixiao, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, also established many good working systems for the coking workshop, such as the regular patrol inspection system for coke ovens, the cleaning system for gas pipelines, and the temperature and pressure measurement system for coke ovens.
    Because Tang Sixiao often studied production technology problems with the workers, she learned a lot from the workers. On the other hand, she also deeply felt that although the workers' experience was rich, they still lacked technical theory, and the workers also had an urgent need to learn technical theory knowledge. In order to improve the workers' technical and theoretical knowledge, she and some other technicians jointly opened technical study classes for the workers. She got up early and went to bed late every day to prepare lessons for the workers, carefully studying how to make the workers truly understand this technical and theoretical knowledge, and combine this knowledge with their rich operating experience. With her enthusiastic and responsible help, many workers improved their technical level, and five of them were promoted to gas foremen as a result.
    Tang Sixiao has worked beside the coke oven for six years, and not only has she been well-trained in technology, making her grow into a skilled director of a coking workshop, but also in the six years of intense work and life with the workers, her class consciousness has also been greatly improved. With the help and cultivation of the Party organization and the Youth League, she gloriously joined the Youth League and the Communist Party. When encountering difficulties in her work, she always resolutely relied on the Party and League organizations. The Party and the League increased her confidence in her work and gave her unlimited strength. In the most difficult times, as long as she thought that she was already a glorious Communist Party member, she would be more courageous to continue working. For six years, she has worked beside the coke oven, and has spent countless days and nights with it. She works diligently, getting up early and going to bed late every day. Sometimes when the coke oven breaks down, she even stays in the workshop all night until the problem is solved before leaving the workshop. Tang Sixiao is such a hard-working girl who loves her career. Now the coking workshop she leads has changed from a backward production workshop to one of the best workshops in the factory.

    一个优秀的炼焦车间女主任
    肖明
    在鞍山钢铁公司化工总厂的第二炼焦车间，有一个看起来十分朴素、说话带点四川口音的年青姑娘，她站在巨人般的冒着火焰的高大的炼焦炉旁边，熟练地指挥着这个车间的生产。在这里，不管是有三十年工龄的老工人，或是工龄不长的年青工人，都是怀着敬爱的心情和她一起工作着。这个年青的姑娘就是这个车间的主任——唐嗣孝。
    六年前，唐嗣孝还是一个刚从四川大学毕业的学生，虽然学的是化学，却不知道炼焦炉是个什么样子。可是现在，她已经是一个优秀的炼焦车间主任了。
    1950年的5月，唐嗣孝从成都来到了鞍钢。当她第一次站在高大的炼焦炉旁，仰望着火红的焦炭从高大的炼焦炉里倾倒出来的时候，她的心也像焦炭一样燃烧起来了。她久久地伫立在这高大的炼焦炉旁，她感到兴奋。从这时候起，她就爱上了炼焦工作。
    当厂里的领导同志征求唐嗣孝对分配工作的意见的时候，她毫不犹豫地要求派她到化工总厂的炼焦车间工作。当时，炼焦车间还没有过女同志。唐嗣孝开始到炼焦炉上工作的时候，许多工人都用惊奇的眼光看待她。有些工人在偷偷地笑这个年青的女大学生，他们说：“连小伙子们在这炼焦炉上都烤的够呛，你一个姑娘家能受得了吗？”炉上的老工人也说：“打伪满起，就没有见过一个女人上过炼焦炉，女同志还是坐在办公室里写写算算好。”但是，这一切并没有使唐嗣孝失去信心。她坚决地相信自己能够掌握炼焦技术。从上班的第一天起，她每天就早去晚走，甚至星期天也要到炼焦炉上去。在见习期间，厂里领导同志知道她在工作中能刻苦钻研，便鼓励她多接近工人，向工人学习操作技术和生产经验。
    在工作中，她感到自己对炼焦炉的知识懂得太少了。炎热的盛夏，唐嗣孝每天和工人们一起在炉上炉下工作，灼热的火炉和带着煤气的烟灰有时候熏烤得她头昏，汗水透过她的衬衫直浸到厚厚的帆布操作服上，但是她到底没有被炼焦炉烤焦。她逐渐地和工人们熟悉起来了。她看见老师傅清扫炉体的时候，她就抢着去帮忙。老工人们看见这个大学生同自己一样干活，没有一点架子，都亲切地把自己几十年来的操作经验告诉了她，都成了她在实际工作中的最好的老师。
    六个月的见习时期满了以后，她被正式分配到第八号和第九号炼焦炉上负责两个炉子的生产技术工作。
    第八号、第九号炉子都是在伪满时期用旧材料拼造成的，毛病很多，生产中常出废品。别的炉子十六小时就能结焦，这两个炉子要十八小时才能结焦，并且炼出来的焦经常夹生。担负着这两个炉子的生产技术责任真是不轻呵！这个年青姑娘真有些焦急了。有好些个夜晚她都睡不着觉，总想着如何才能把生产搞好，使这两个老炉子也能正常生产。她知道有许多老工人是非常熟悉这两个炉子的，她就虚心地向这些工人请教。有个有三十多年看火经验的姜守维老师傅，最熟悉这两个炉子的毛病。姜师傅最初不怎么看得起这个年青的姑娘。唐嗣孝没有灰心，她努力使自己多接近姜师傅，一有空她就向姜师傅去请教。就这样，她不仅从姜师傅那里，对八、九号两个炼焦炉的历史和这两个老炉子的病根子有了进一步的了解，同时使姜师傅也转变了对她的看法。
    她摸清了炼焦炉的毛病以后，便开始研究怎样来修理它，先修理它的那些地方。她考虑了很久，一直没敢作最后的决定。这时正好苏联专家来了解他们这两个炼焦炉的生产情况来了，苏联专家仔细检查以后，指出炉子已经漏缝了，需要首先修补，这对唐嗣孝是个很大的启发。为了修好这些漏缝，她想了一个办法，把一些裁好的纸条往炉墙外面贴，如果纸条被吸住在炉墙上，就证明这里是有漏缝的地方了。当她带领一些瓦工们去贴纸条的时候，果然有成千的纸条都被吸住在炉墙上了，很容易地找到了漏缝。最初，负责修补漏缝的瓦工们有些厌烦，说这老大的炉子漏一点缝又算什么呢？唐嗣孝心中有数，她知道不修补好炉体，炉温不会正常，炼焦的质量也不会提高。她把这些道理讲给瓦工们听，并且亲自和他们一起站到高处上去用耐火泥一条小缝一条小缝地抅补。经过她和工人们几个月的努力，炉子的漏缝终于修补好了，炼出来的焦炭已经不再夹生了。
    炉缝修补好了以后，炼焦的质量提高了，但是她发现炉温还是不能保持均匀正常，结焦的时间也还不能赶上别的炼焦炉。这时唐嗣孝又耐心地找工人们一起研究，工人们说瓦斯管道堵塞了，提议进行清扫。她接受了他们的建议，又仔细地检查了一遍瓦斯管道，证明工人的建议是完全正确的。
    清扫瓦斯管道的工作是艰苦的。当时，正是六月天，炼焦炉旁已经闷热得够呛，何况还要爬进那些不通风的热得烫人的瓦斯管道里去清扫。但是唐嗣孝决定不管怎样困难，自己也要带头完成这项工作。因为她平时能同工人打成一片，受到了工人们的爱戴。在他的带动下，许多工人都钻进管道里去了。她一面清扫着管道，一面仔细地检查着管道有没有漏洞。虽然她的全身都已被汗水浸透了，呛人的烟灰有时候使她喘不过气来，可是她坚持着，忍耐着。许多工人被她的艰苦负责的工作精神感动了。他们顺利地完成了清扫工作。炉温很快地就保持了正常和稳定，瓦斯的消耗量也显著地降低了，结焦的时间也赶上了其他的炼焦炉。
    在八、九号两个炼焦炉的大修工作中，唐嗣孝根据苏联专家的建议，还给炼焦车间建立了许多良好的工作制度，如对炼焦炉的定期巡回检查制度，对瓦斯管道的清扫制度，以及对炼焦炉的温度和压力测量制度等。
    由于唐嗣孝经常和工人们在一起研究生产技术问题，她从工人那里学习了不少东西。另一方面她也深深地感到工人们经验虽然丰富，但是对于技术理论还是缺乏，同时工人们也有学习技术理论知识的迫切要求。为了提高工人们的技术理论知识，她和其他一些技术员共同为工人们开办了技术学习班。她每天早起晚睡地为工人们教课备课，细心研究如何能够使工人们真正听懂这些技术理论的知识，并且使这些知识和他们的丰富操作经验结合起来。在她热心负责的帮助下，许多工人都提高了技术水平，其中有五名工人因此被提升为煤气工长。
    在炼焦炉旁，唐嗣孝工作了六年，不仅技术上得到了很好的锻炼，使她成长为一个熟练的炼焦车间主任，同时在六年来和工人一起紧张地工作和生活中，使她的阶级觉悟也得到很大的提高。她在党组织和青年团的帮助和培养下，先后光荣地参加了青年团和共产党。在工作中遇到困难的时候，她总是坚决地依靠党、团组织。党和团提高了她的工作的信心，给了她无限的力量。在最艰难的时候，她只要一想到自己已经是一个光荣的共产党员，她就会更加鼓起勇气来干下去。六年来，她工作在炼焦炉旁，不知和它一起熬过了多少个白昼和黑夜。她每天早起晚睡地勤勉地工作着，有时候炼焦炉出了毛病，她甚至整夜地留在车间，直到把问题解决以后才离开车间。唐嗣孝就是这样一个埋头苦干，热爱自己事业的姑娘。现在她领导的这个炼焦车间已经由一个生产上落后的车间变成为全厂优秀车间中的一个了。（附图片）
