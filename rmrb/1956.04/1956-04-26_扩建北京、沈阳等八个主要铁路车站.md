    Expansion of Eight Major Railway Stations Including Beijing and Shenyang
    The railway hub stations in Beijing, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Harbin, and Datong, which are planned to be expanded during China's first Five-Year Plan, as well as the Jinzhou and Pingxiang stations, which were advanced for expansion during the first Five-Year Plan, are currently under intensive construction.
    The workers in charge of the Fengtai Station hump marshalling yard project, a component of the Beijing railway hub station, have completed the first phase of the project and are preparing for the second phase of construction. This hump marshalling yard consists of marshalling yards in both the inbound and outbound directions. Marshalling operations will rely on the slopes and level ground of the hump, which is built by manual filling, and will use radio communication. Signals and switches will adopt interlocking centralized control electrification devices. After the completion of this marshalling yard, the marshalling capacity will be two and a half times the original marshalling capacity of Fengtai Station. The initial projects of the Zhengzhou and Harbin railway hub stations and the Jinzhou and Pingxiang stations will be completed this year.
    A total of fourteen major stations are planned for expansion during China's first Five-Year Plan. Among them, the expansion projects of the Tianjin railway hub station and the Siping, Lingshan, and Dahushan stations have been completed and put into use. The expansion projects of the Taiyuan, Wuhan, and Xi'an railway hub stations and the Benxi South Station are currently under design. The expansion of the Chengdu railway hub station, which the state decided to advance during the first Five-Year Plan, is also under design.

    扩建北京、沈阳等八个主要铁路车站
    我国第一个五年计划中规定扩建的北京、沈阳、石家庄、郑州、哈尔滨和大同等铁路枢纽站，以及提前在第一个五年计划期间扩建的锦州、凭祥两车站目前正在加紧施工。
    担任北京铁路枢纽站组成部分——丰台站驼峰调车场工程的职工已经完成了第一期工程，正在准备进行第二期施工。这个驼峰调车场是由上行、下行两个方向的调车场组成。调车作业将依靠用人工填筑起来的驼峰的坡道和平道来进行，用无线电联络。信号和道岔是采取联锁集中操纵的电气化装置。这个调车场建成以后，调车能力等于丰台站原有调车能力两倍半。郑州、哈尔滨铁路枢纽站和锦州、凭祥车站的初期工程将在今年完工。
    我国第一个五年计划中规定扩建的主要车站共有十四处。其中天津铁路枢纽站和四平、灵山、大虎山等车站的扩建工程已经完工交付使用。太原、武汉、西安等铁路枢纽站和本溪南站的扩建工程正在设计。国家决定提前在第一个五年计划期间扩建的成都铁路枢纽站也在设计当中。
