    Numbers on Financial Vouchers Should Not Be Written in Simplified Chinese Characters
    Some readers have written to inquire: The Chinese character simplification scheme has already been announced by the State Council, so why does the People's Bank of China still stipulate that numbers written on financial vouchers must use traditional characters (such as 壹, 贰, 拾, 佰, 仟, 萬, etc.)? Does this regulation conflict with the promotion of simplified Chinese characters? After research, the People's Bank of China gives the following brief reply to this question:
    The use of traditional numerals on financial vouchers is to ensure strict procedures and safeguard national property. In the past few years, due to the carelessness of some units in filling out vouchers, some bad elements have altered vouchers to fraudulently claim funds, causing losses to state property. This bank has consulted the Chinese Writing Reform Committee for their opinion. They agreed that simplified characters should not be used when writing numbers on financial vouchers, and proposed that "the writing of numbers on bank vouchers can be handled according to the 'other special reasons' provision in the State Council's decision." Prior to this, Ye Gongchuo, a standing committee member of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, also mentioned in his "Report on the Work of Chinese Character Simplification" delivered at the National Language Reform Conference in October 1955: "The numerals on various industry or financial documents should still follow regulations and use traditional numerals (such as 壹, 贰, 拾, 佰, 仟, 萬, etc.), unchanged." Therefore, we have decided that the numbers written on banking business vouchers (such as checks, cash deposit slips, remittance slips, IOUs, loan applications, etc.) should not use simplified characters.

    在财务凭证上填写的数字不用简体字
    有些读者来信询问：汉字简化方案已经由国务院公布，为什么中国人民银行规定在财务凭证上填写的数字仍然要用繁体字（如壹、贰、拾、佰、仟、萬等）？这个规定是否和推行简化汉字有抵触？经中国人民银行研究后，对这个问题简复如下：
    在财务凭证上使用繁体数字，是为了严密手续和保证国家财产的安全。过去几年来，由于某些单位在填写凭证的时候不够慎重，就曾发生了一些坏分子涂改凭证冒领款项的事件，使国家财产遭受损失。本行曾经征求过中国文字改革委员会的意见。他们对于在财务凭证上填写数字的时候不用简化字表示同意，提出“在银行凭证上填写数字，可照国务院决议中‘其他特殊原因’的规定处理”。在这以前，中国文字改革委员会常务委员叶恭绰在1955年10月召开的全国文字改革会议上所作“关于汉字简化工作的报告”中也曾经提到：“在各行业或财务单据上的数目字，按规定用繁体数字的（如壹、贰、拾、佰、仟、萬等），仍旧不变。”因此，我们决定在银行业务凭证（如支票、现金缴款单、汇款委托书、借据、借款申请书等）上所填写的数字不用简化字。
