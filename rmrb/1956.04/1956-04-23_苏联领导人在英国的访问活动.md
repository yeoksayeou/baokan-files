    Soviet Leaders' Visit to the United Kingdom
    At the Royal Naval College
    On the evening of April 20th, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, visited the Royal Naval College in Greenwich at the invitation of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Cilcennin.
    Lord Cilcennin hosted a banquet in the Great Hall of the Royal Naval College on behalf of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to entertain Bulganin and Khrushchev.
    Lord Cilcennin delivered a welcoming speech to the Soviet leaders. He said: Seated with Your Excellencies now are representatives of the armed forces who, as allies of your armed forces, once fought together on land, in the air, and at sea. Lord Cilcennin said that the Soviet and British armed forces share heroism in common. However, if servicemen can talk to servicemen regardless of the difficulties caused by misunderstandings that occur from time to time, then I am convinced that they can discover another equally strong common ground: the love of peace.
    Lord Cilcennin said, I believe that among the millions who are watching your visit to our country, none more strongly hopes than the servicemen of our two countries that the results of the visit will serve peace and mutual understanding between our peoples.
    Next, Bulganin spoke amid warm applause from the attendees. He said that we are very pleased to be guests in this world-renowned Greenwich. More than two hundred and fifty years ago, Peter the Great, the founder of the Russian Navy, visited Greenwich and came to this building along the Thames.
    Bulganin said that during the Second World War, your brave sailors piloted long lines of fleets from Britain to the northern coast of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people deeply remember the names of the British generals who led these operations, as well as other army and navy generals and officers who cooperated with our armed forces during the difficult years of the last war. The Soviet people remember them and express their gratitude for their military exploits. We congratulate ourselves on the fact that the contact between the Soviet fleet and the British fleet formed during the war has been maintained to this day. Not long ago, warships of our two countries paid friendly visits to each other. This is beneficial to you and to us. Our maritime gates are always open for friendly visits.
    Bulganin said: The deepest desire of the Soviet people is the desire for peace. All our people ardently hope that the current atmosphere of peace will never be disrupted. The Soviet government insists on striving to resolve the disarmament issue and strives to establish friendly cooperation with all countries, and good relations and friendship between countries are the most reliable guarantee for maintaining and consolidating world peace.
    Bulganin said that the purpose of our visit to your country is to make Britain and the Soviet Union better understand each other and establish close and multi-faceted ties between our two countries through negotiations with your government officials. We believe that this is in the interests of both countries.
    Khrushchev also spoke at the banquet and was warmly welcomed by those present.
    At the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment
    On the 21st, Bulganin and Khrushchev visited the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment, sixty miles west of London, one of the most famous research institutions in Britain for the study of nuclear energy.
    Bulganin and Khrushchev arrived at Harwell at 11:00 am local time. The guests were welcomed by the Chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, Plowden, and the Director of Research for the Authority and Director of the Harwell Atomic Energy Center, the famous British scientist John Cockcroft.
    Professor Cockcroft led Bulganin, Khrushchev, and accompanying personnel, including Academician Kurchatov, to visit two reactor installations and two laboratories at the Harwell Atomic Energy Center.
    Representatives of the Harwell trade union organization welcomed Bulganin and Khrushchev in this hall.
    In Oxford City and Oxford University
    On the afternoon of the 21st, Bulganin and Khrushchev traveled by car from Harwell to the famous university city of Oxford in Britain for a visit. They were accompanied by British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and others. They were greeted in front of Oxford City Hall by a large crowd of waiting people who cheered and greeted them, and by the Mayor of Oxford, Lowther.
    At a forum held in the City Hall, the Mayor of Oxford delivered a speech, expressing his sincere welcome to the Soviet leaders and wishing them success in their negotiations with the British leaders.
    In his reply, Bulganin, on behalf of himself and Khrushchev, expressed his pleasure at visiting Oxford, such a famous center of science and culture. Bulganin emphasized that the Soviet side is making sincere efforts to achieve good results in the talks.
    In his subsequent speech, Khrushchev emphasized that the purpose of the Soviet leaders' visit is to promote the easing of international tensions. Khrushchev agreed with the wishes for the success of the talks, and pointed out that such success could be achieved as long as both sides made similar efforts.
    In a brief speech, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd emphasized the British side's concern for the success of the talks. He said that there should be frankness in the talks and hoped that joint steps would be taken to ease tensions.
    After the talks in the City Hall, Bulganin, Khrushchev and their entourage went to visit the various colleges of Oxford University, located in the city center. These colleges include beautiful buildings from various British dynasties, forming a unique architectural complex.
    The Soviet guests visited "Clarendon Building" where Oxford University’s governing body meets in conference, and visited the largest and oldest “Magdalen” College, “New College” and the famous Bodleian Library.
    After the visit, tea was served to the guests at "New College". When Bulganin and Khrushchev left Oxford, many local residents and students lined the streets to see them off, with students cheering and singing songs.
    After leaving Oxford, Bulganin and Khrushchev went to Chequers, the suburban residence of British Prime Minister Eden, to continue the talks between the Soviet and British leaders that had begun a few days earlier at 10 Downing Street. They will stay at Chequers until the morning of the 22nd. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联领导人在英国的访问活动
    在皇家海军学院
    四月二十日晚间，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫应英国海军首席大臣西耳森宁勋爵的邀请，访问了在格林威治的皇家海军学院。
    西耳森宁勋爵在皇家海军学院大礼堂中代表陆、海、空军设宴招待布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。
    西耳森宁勋爵向苏联领导人致欢迎词。他说：现在同两位阁下坐在一起的，是曾经作为你们的武装部队的盟友在陆地、空中和海上共同作战的武装部队的代表。西耳森宁说，苏联和英国武装部队的共同点是英勇。然而，如果军人和军人之间能够不顾一切由于不时发生的不正确了解所造成的困难而彼此谈谈，那么我确信他们可以发现另一种同样强烈的共同点：热爱和平。
    西耳森宁说，我认为，在注视着你们访问我国的千百万人之中，没有人比我们两国的军人更加强烈地希望访问的结果能够服务于和平和我们人民间的相互了解了。
    接着，布尔加宁在与会者的热烈掌声中讲话。他说，我们在这全世界知名的格林威治作客感到非常愉快。两百五十多年以前，俄国海军的创始者彼得大帝就曾访问过格林威治，他顺着泰晤士河来到这所大厦里。
    布尔加宁说，在第二次世界大战中，你们勇敢的海员驾驶着长列的舰队从英国开往苏联北部一带海岸。苏联人民深深记得领导这些行动的英国将领的名字以及在上次大战的艰苦年代中同我们的武装部队合作的其他海陆军将领和军官的名字。苏联人民记得他们，并且对他们的战功表示感谢。我们对在战争时期形成的苏联舰队和英国舰队之间的接触一直保持到现在表示庆贺。不久以前我们两国的军舰互相作了友好的访问。这对你们，对我们都是有益的。我们海上的大门永远为友好访问而敞开着。
    布尔加宁说：苏联人民最深切的愿望就是要求和平的愿望。我国所有的人都热切地希望现在的一片和平气氛永远不会遭到破坏。苏联政府坚持争取解决裁军问题，为同一切国家建立友好合作而努力，而各国之间的良好关系和友谊，是维护和巩固世界和平的最可靠的保障。
    布尔加宁说，我们访问贵国的目的，是通过与贵国政府人士谈判的途径来使得英国和苏联彼此更加了解，建立我们两国之间的密切的和多方面的联系。我们相信，这是符合两国的利益的。
    赫鲁晓夫在宴会上也讲了话，受到到会者的热烈欢迎。
    在哈威尔原子能中心
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫二十一日参观了伦敦以西六十英里的哈威尔原子能科学研究中心，这是英国在研究核子能方面最著名的研究机构之一。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在当地时间十一点到达哈威尔。客人们受到英国原子能委员会主席普劳登和委员会研究组主任兼哈威尔原子能中心主任、著名英国科学家约翰·柯克罗夫特的欢迎。
    柯克罗夫特教授领布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和包括库尔查托夫院士在内的随行人员参观哈威尔原子能中心的两个反应堆装置和两个实验室。
    哈威尔工会组织代表在这个大厅中欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。
    在牛津城和牛津大学
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫二十一日下午从哈威尔乘汽车去英国著名的大学城牛津参观。陪同前往参观的有英国外交大臣劳埃德等。他们在牛津市政厅门前受到等候着的大批群众的欢呼致意和牛津市长娄厄的欢迎。
    在市政厅里举行的座谈会上，牛津市长致词，向苏联领导人表示衷心的欢迎，并且祝他们在同英国领导人进行的谈判中获得成就。
    布尔加宁在答词中以他个人和赫鲁晓夫的名义对访问牛津这样一个著名的科学文化中心表示愉快。布尔加宁强调指出，苏联方面正为使会谈获得良好的结果作真诚的努力。
    赫鲁晓夫在接着的讲话中强调指出，苏联领导人的访问目的在于促进缓和国际紧张局势。赫鲁晓夫表示同意对会谈取得成功的祝愿，他指出，只要双方同样努力，这种成功是可以获得的。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在简短的致词中，强调指出了英国方面对于会谈获得成功的关切。他说在会谈中应该彼此开诚相见，并且希望共同采取导致缓和紧张局势的步骤。
    在市政厅里的谈话结束以后，布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和他们的随行人员前往参观位于城市中心的牛津大学各学院，这些学院包括英国历代的美丽的建筑物，形成一个独具特色的建筑群。
    苏联客人们访问了牛津大学校董会会议大厅所在的“克拉伦登大楼”，参观了牛津大学规模最大和最古老的“马格达伦”学院、“新学院”以及著名的波德莱伊图书馆。
    参观结束以后，在“新学院”举行了茶会招待客人们。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫离开牛津时，当地的许多居民和学生夹道欢送他们，学生们高声欢呼并且唱着歌曲。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫离开牛津后，前往英国首相艾登的郊外官邸——契克斯，继续举行苏联和英国领导人前几天在唐宁街十号开始的会谈。他们将在契克斯停留到二十二日上午。（据新华社讯）
