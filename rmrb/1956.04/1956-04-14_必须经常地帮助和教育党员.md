We Must Constantly Help and Educate Party Members
Sun Jichang

In order to consolidate the achievements of Party rectification and prevent the breeding and development of shortcomings within the Party at any time, it is necessary to constantly analyze and study the ideological situation within the Party and to provide specific assistance and education to Party members on a regular basis. The experience of the Jing Sheng Village branch in Shulan County, Jilin Province, once again proves this point.

This branch had previously conducted Party rectification and resolved many problems. However, before long, the shortcomings of some Party members grew and developed again, and the problems within the Party piled up again. What was the reason for this? It was precisely because the Party branch was satisfied with the achievements of Party rectification and thus relaxed its regular ideological education within the Party.

Last winter, during the great development of cooperatives, this branch conducted another Party rectification. Before the rectification, twelve of the thirty-three Party members were not doing Party work. After the rectification, the active became more active, and the passive became active, and they all took the initiative to ask to be assigned Party work. This time, the branch learned from the lessons of this Party rectification and decided that it must continue to strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership and strengthen the regular assistance and education of Party members. The branch first paid attention to providing specific assistance to those Party members whose thinking had changed and who had begun to work actively, in order to consolidate their work enthusiasm and confidence. For example, Party member Zhang Hai was originally very passive in his work; after Party rectification, Zhang Hai became active in his work. When he began to work actively, some people did not trust him very much, which caused some difficulties in his work. The branch immediately explained Zhang Hai's transformation in Party rectification to the masses and helped Zhang Hai do his work well, so that he quickly gained the trust of the masses. After Party rectification, female Party member Li Fengchun was very willing to participate in various tasks, but she lacked working methods. The branch often provided her with specific assistance, and every time she was assigned a task, she was taught how to do the work well at the same time. When encountering difficulties, the branch promptly helped her overcome them. In this way, her work enthusiasm was continuously consolidated and improved.

The branch did not relax its assistance and education to Party members whose ideological transformation was not significant during Party rectification. For example, Party member Shao Kuijun was still not actively working after Party rectification and often put his personal interests in opposition to the interests of the cooperative. The branch secretary and branch committee members often talked to him individually and patiently helped him make progress.

After this Party rectification, the branch also realized that Party rectification could not solve all problems well, and new problems would continue to arise as the situation changed. After the merger of the primary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives in the whole village, two incorrect ideas emerged within the Party: one was that some Party members who were not cooperative cadres became passive because there were fewer cooperative cadres than before. For example, Party member Wang Bojun was originally the director of a primary cooperative, but now he is not a cadre of the cooperative, so he has become passive. After the branch discovered this, it immediately talked to him, explained to him the reason why cadres would inevitably decrease after the merger; at the same time, it explained that even if Party members are not cadres, they should work actively. This dispelled his concerns, and now he is actively doing Party work again. The other was that many Party members saw that the whole village was fully socialist cooperative and thought that things would be easier to handle in the future, and the responsibilities of Party members would be reduced, so they had the idea of taking a break. When the branch learned of this situation, it immediately convened a branch meeting to analyze the new situations and new problems that had arisen in the cooperative after the full socialist cooperation. Completing the full socialist cooperation does not mean that the Party's task of building socialism in the countryside has been completed, but only creates better conditions for building socialism. There is still a long and arduous struggle to be made before a socialist society can be built. Therefore, the responsibilities of Party members have not been reduced, but increased. The idea of taking a break must be criticized. This was a profound education for the Party members, making it clear to everyone their important responsibilities after the full socialist cooperation, continuing to maintain full work enthusiasm, and working actively. This laid an ideological foundation for further enhancing the Party's leadership role in the cooperative.

    必须经常地帮助和教育党员
    孙继昌
    为了巩固整党的成果，随时防止党内缺点的滋生和发展，就必须经常对党内的思想状况进行分析研究，经常对党员进行具体的帮助和教育。吉林省舒兰县景圣村支部工作的经验又一次证明了这一点。
    这个支部，以前也进行过整党，也解决了不少问题。可是，过不多久，一些党员的缺点又滋长发展起来，党内的问题又成了堆，这是什么原因呢？正是这个党支部满足于整党的成绩，从而放松了对党内经常的思想教育工作的结果。
    去年冬天，在合作社的大发展中，这个支部又进行了一次整党，在整党前，三十三名党员中就有十二名不作党的工作。经过整党以后，积极的更积极了，消极的也积极起来，而且都主动地要求分配他们作党的工作。这次，支部就接受了这次整党的教训，决定必须继续加强党的政治思想领导，加强对党员的经常帮助和教育。支部首先注意对那些思想有了转变开始积极工作的党员作具体帮助，以便巩固他们的工作积极性和信心。如党员张海，原来工作上很消极；整党以后，张海工作积极了。当他开始积极工作的时候，还有人不很信任他，使他的工作发生了一些困难。支部立即就向群众说明张海在整党中的转变，并且帮助张海做好工作，这样他就很快获得了群众的信任。女党员李凤春整党以后，很愿意参加各种工作，可是缺少工作办法，支部就经常对她作具体帮助，每交给她一项工作，就同时教给她做好工作的方法。遇到困难，支部又及时帮助她克服。这样，就不断地巩固和提高了她的工作积极性。
    对整党中思想转变不显著的党员，支部也没有放松对他们的帮助和教育。像党员邵奎君，在整党以后仍不积极工作，并且经常把个人利益和合作社的利益对立起来。支部书记和支部委员就经常找他个别谈话，耐心地帮助他进步。
    这次整党以后，支部还认识到，整党决不可能把一切问题都解决得很好，而且随着情况的变化还会不断产生新的问题。全村初级社合并为高级社以后，党内又产生了两种不正确的思想：一种是由于合作社的干部较前减少，有些没有当合作社干部的党员就消极起来。如党员王伯君原来是一个初级合作社的社主任，现在没有当社的干部，就消极起来。支部发现以后，马上找他谈话，向他说明并社以后，干部必然减少的道理；同时说明党员即使不当干部，也要积极工作的道理，这就打消了他的顾虑，现在，他又积极地做党的工作了。另一种是有不少党员看到全村全社会主义合作化了，就认为以后事情好办了，党员的责任减轻了，产生了歇一歇的思想。支部了解到这种情况，马上召开了支部大会，分析了全社会主义合作化以后合作社里产生的新情况和新问题。完成了全社会主义合作化，并不是已经完成了党在农村建设社会主义的任务，只是为建设社会主义创造了更好的条件，离开建成社会主义社会还有一段艰苦奋斗的路程。因此，党员的责任不是减轻了，而是加重了。歇一歇的思想是必须加以批判的。这对党员是一次深刻的教育，使大家明确了自己在全社会主义合作化以后的重大责任，继续保持饱满的工作情绪，积极工作。这就为进一步提高党在合作社中的领导作用打下了思想基础。
