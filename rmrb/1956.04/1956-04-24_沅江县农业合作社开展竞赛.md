Agricultural Cooperatives in Yuanjiang County Launch Competition

One hundred and thirty-five agricultural production cooperatives in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, are deeply engaged in a socialist labor competition, which has powerfully promoted spring plowing and production. After the launch of the competition, the attendance rate of the Xihu Agricultural Production Cooperative increased by 60%. The Xifu Agricultural Production Cooperative organized twenty busy season nurseries, which more than doubled the attendance rate of women.

In the socialist labor competition, many agricultural technology inventions and creations have also emerged. According to recent statistics, various cooperatives have put forward more than 300 rationalization proposals for agricultural production. Liu Mingfeng, a member of the Communist Youth League in the Qianlijiao Agricultural Production Cooperative, invented a double-shared wooden plow, which is more than twice as efficient as the old plow. The county plans to promote 4,000 units, and 2,000 units have already been successfully manufactured and put into production. Cai Yide of the Dongtingchun Agricultural Production Cooperative created the "sun-dried mat germination method," which has played a significant role in seed soaking and sowing.

    沅江县农业合作社开展竞赛
    湖南省沅江县的一百三十五个农业生产合作社，正在深入展开社会主义劳动竞赛，有力地推动了春耕生产。西湖农业生产合作社在开展竞赛后，出勤率提高了60％，熙福农业生产合作社组织了二十个农忙托儿所，使妇女出勤率提高一倍以上。
    在社会主义劳动竞赛中，许多农业技术上的发明创造也涌现出来了。据最近统计，各个社共提出了三百多条农业生产上的合理化建议。千里驹农业生产合作社青年团员刘明凤发明了双铧木犁，比旧犁效率提高一倍以上。全县计划推广四千部，现在已经有二千部制造成功投入生产。洞庭春农业生产合作社蔡益德创造“晒簟催芽法”对浸种播种起了重大作用。
