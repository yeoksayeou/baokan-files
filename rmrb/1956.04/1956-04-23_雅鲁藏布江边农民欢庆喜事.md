　　A colorfully decorated float, accompanied by the sounds of gongs and drums, arrived at the banks of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. It was a propaganda team from all sectors of Xigazê, formed to celebrate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

　　On April 19th, on the south bank of the river, members of the propaganda team explained the significance of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region to the farmers. After listening, the farmers congratulated each other. The elderly, in wooden platters filled with tsampa, inserted colorful wheat ears and presented them before the portrait of Chairman Mao, expressing their joy and gratitude; the young women, holding blossoming peach blossoms, sang and danced. Jiangba, a farmer in his sixties, was so happy that tears streamed down his face. He said excitedly: "The people of our Xika all say that the Communist Party leads us to a brighter future. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, under the leadership of the Communist Party, our happiness will be like the water of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, vast and endless.”

　　Farmers from Yinmagang on the north bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo River drove their horses to the river to welcome the propaganda team. The propaganda team held a report meeting in Yinmagang, attended by more than two hundred people. Herdsmen from deep in the mountains also rode horses to participate. Jiacuo, the chieftain here, on behalf of all the villagers, presented a Hada to the portrait of Chairman Mao. After listening to the report, the young people jumped on their horses and ran to neighboring places to spread the good news. The joyous news that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was about to be established quickly spread throughout the mountain villages and pastures on the north bank.

　　Every village the propaganda team arrived at, they were immediately surrounded by joyful crowds. Farmers from many villages collectively wrote letters to the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, expressing their support and congratulations.

    雅鲁藏布江边农民欢庆喜事
    一辆彩车锣鼓喧天地开到了雅鲁藏布江边，这是日喀则各界人民为庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会成立而组成的一支宣传队。
    四月十九日，在江南岸宣传队员们向农民讲解了西藏自治区筹委会成立的意义。农民们听了以后互相道贺。老人们在盛满糌粑的木盘内，插上彩色麦穗，捧到毛主席像前，表示自己的喜悦和感激；姑娘们捧着盛开的桃花，边歌边舞。六十多岁的农民江巴高兴得淌下眼泪，他激动地说：“我们溪卡的人们都说共产党领导我们越走越光明，自治区筹委会成立了，在共产党领导下，我们的幸福就像雅鲁藏布江的水，浩浩荡荡，无穷无尽。”
    雅鲁藏布江北岸饮马岗的农民，把马赶到江边来迎接宣传队到那里去。宣传队在饮马岗举行了有二百多人参加的报告会，山沟深处的牧人也骑马赶来参加，这里的头人甲错代表全村人民把哈达挂在毛主席的像上。青年们听了报告以后，翻身上马跑到邻近地方去报喜，西藏自治区筹委会即将成立的喜讯，很快就在北岸的山村和牧场传开了。
    宣传队每到一个村庄，立刻就被欢乐的人群包围起来。许多村庄的农民，集体给西藏自治区筹委会写信，表示拥护和祝贺。
