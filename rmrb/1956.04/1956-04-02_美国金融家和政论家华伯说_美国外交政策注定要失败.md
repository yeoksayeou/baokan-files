Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from New York, TASS—The magazine "Progress" published an article by the well-known American financier and political commentator James Warburg, which criticized American foreign policy.

Warburg wrote that events show that American foreign policy is very unsatisfactory and is "doomed to fail."

Warburg pointed out that in Europe, American policy "has reached a dead end" because it does not allow Germany a chance to achieve peaceful reunification; Germany cannot be peacefully reunited due to the creation of twelve divisions of the West German army within three years. In the Middle East, the attempt to establish the so-called "Northern Tier Alliance" (i.e., the so-called Baghdad Pact) has caused the danger of war and strengthened Soviet influence. In the Far East, "America's position remains very rigid because it unrealistically refuses to recognize facts," refusing to recognize the People's Republic of China and hold negotiations with it.

Warburg said that the rapid rise of Soviet industry and the Soviet Union's willingness to help backward countries develop their economies without requiring them to undertake political or military obligations have further weakened America's international position.

Warburg pointed out that neutralism is constantly strengthening. He said: "One cannot help but come to the conclusion that if we continue to adhere to our current policy, we will become increasingly isolated, our military alliances will become increasingly meaningless, and more and more countries that have not joined any group will be attracted into the Soviet Union's trade and sphere of influence."

Warburg suggested that the United States should realistically assess the situation in the Far East, look at European issues with new eyes, and put forward concrete plans for international disarmament to the people of the world.

    美国金融家和政论家华伯说
    美国外交政策注定要失败
    新华社30日讯　塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：“进步”杂志刊载了美国著名的金融家和政论家詹姆斯·华伯的一篇文章，文章指责美国的外交政策。
    华伯写道，事件表明，美国外交政策是十分不能令人满意的，并且是“注定要失败”的。
    华伯指出，在欧洲，美国的政策“已经走上了绝路”，因为它不容许德国有达成和平统一的机会；德国不能和平统一是由于要在三年之内建立十二个师的西德军队造成的。在中东，想建立所谓“北层联盟”
  （即所谓巴格达条约）的企图引起了爆发战争的危险，并且加强了苏联的影响。在远东，“美国的地位仍旧很僵，因为它不现实地拒绝承认事实”，拒绝承认中华人民共和国和同它举行谈判。
    华伯说，苏联工业的迅速高涨，苏联愿意帮助落后国家发展经济而不要求它们承担政治的或是军事的义务，这就使美国的国际地位更加削弱了。
    华伯指出，中立主义在不断加强。他说：“不能不得出这样的结论：如果我们继续抱定目前的方针，我们将越来越陷于孤立，我们的军事联盟会变得越来越没有意义，而没有参加任何集团的国家将越来越多地被吸引到苏联的贸易和势力范围中去。”
    华伯建议美国应当现实地估计远东的局势，用新的眼光来看欧洲问题和向世界人民提出国际裁军的具体计划。
