    Demand for More and Better Comic Books
    Jiang Weipu

    In recent years, the number of comic book publications has increased significantly. In 1952, about 670 new comic books were published nationwide, with a total circulation of more than 21.7 million copies including reprints. In 1954, nearly 900 new titles were published, and the total circulation increased to more than 35.8 million copies. According to preliminary statistics, the total circulation increased to more than 52.5 million copies in 1955. The number of new titles and copies published by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House and Chaohua Fine Arts Publishing House alone in 1955 was three times that of 1952. There has also been a great improvement in content and artistry. Expressing socialism and patriotism has become an important theme of comic books, and some works with vivid stories, realistic images, and educational significance have appeared. For example, "Old Sun Returns to the Cooperative" compiled by Yang Zhaolin, drawn by Ding Hao and Cheng Shifa; "Competing with Superpowers" adapted by Lin Rui, drawn by Zhang Yuejian; "On Nan Yun Island" drawn by Wen Yongxiong; "Sea Hero" compiled by Ke Lan, drawn by Luo Pan; "Mr. Dong Guo" compiled by Dong Xuxian et al., drawn by Liu Jiyou; "Child Labor" adapted by Xu Guangyu, drawn by Wang Xuyang et al.; "Reconnaissance Across the River" adapted by Zhang Cheng, drawn by Gu Bingxin; "Hun River Water" compiled and drawn by Shen Shen and Jing Qimin; "Little Model Member" compiled by Chang Gengxi and Zhang Hanqing, drawn by Xiao Lin; "Red Flag" drawn by Fei Shengfu, etc., are all very popular among readers. However, the current comic books, whether in quantity or quality, are far from meeting the needs of the people, and there are several problems in compilation and drawing that need to be solved urgently.

    First of all, comic books must increase the variety and number of publications. Because comic books are easy to understand and can be read in a short time, and the readership is very wide—the bookstores and stalls in large and medium-sized cities across the country have 1.5 million to 2 million readers every day, and the rural readership is now beginning to expand—without a regular and large number of new comic books being published, it will not be possible to meet the needs of the masses. The masses need more and better new works, but some of our comic artists underestimate the importance of their work. Some authors are unwilling to compile and draw comic books, thinking that comic books are low-level. They isolatedly emphasize improvement, demanding long-term "deliberation," which takes a long time, but even "low-level" works cannot be completed. This phenomenon of underestimating popularization work must be opposed. At the same time, comic book publishing departments should plan and assign tasks to organize painters and scriptwriters to compile and draw comic books in large quantities and seriously. Publishing and distribution departments should overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, especially to recognize the great victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the new situation brought to rural areas by the vigorous development of the literacy campaign in various places. Supplying enough popular reading materials to farmers in large quantities is a matter that cannot be delayed any longer.

    Comic books must strengthen the reflection of current reality to encourage and educate the broad masses of people to fight for the socialist cause. At present, many comic book works still cannot vividly and powerfully express the major events in the current real life. For example, there are very few comic books reflecting the agricultural cooperation movement. Some of them still mostly show the wavering and hesitating side of some farmers in the cooperation movement, far behind the high tide of the movement. The great industrial construction is the weakest link in the comic book themes. In addition to a few works reflecting the factory protection struggles and anti-spy struggles in the industrial production sector before and in the early days of liberation, there are very few seen in comic books about the labor competitions, inventions, heroic figures, and model deeds of workers on various labor fronts in recent years to complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Some short news reports have appeared on works reflecting the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and works with rich and moving stories are still needed to further educate the masses to raise their vigilance and strengthen the struggle against enemies at home and abroad. Of course, we do not oppose the use of historical themes and folk tales to compile and draw comic books to meet the diverse preferences of the masses; complete sets of long stories such as "Water Margin" are welcomed by the masses. The scope of comic book themes should indeed be expanded to make the content of comic books rich and diverse, but themes reflecting current reality should still be the main ones, and historical themes should also be selected meaningfully.

    Comic books must improve quality. The compilation and drawing style of shoddy work and passing off inferior products as good ones must be strictly opposed. We require comic books to have a strong sense of story and vivid plots. The main reason why the comic book "Chicken Feather Letter" is widely loved by readers is that it has this characteristic. Some comic book works lack storylines and conceptually and boringly record events or explain policies. Although they attempt to express some important themes, they are difficult to move readers and cannot give readers a deep impression. At the same time, since comic books mainly rely on picture images to express content, the characterization of images should be the author's important creative work. It is necessary to require authors to have a deep understanding of the story content and the characters in the story. The image of the individual peasant in the comic book "Old Sun Returns to the Cooperative," the image of the leading cadre in "Competing with Superpowers," the image of the naval commanders and fighters in "On Nan Yun Island," and the character images of "Mr. Dong Guo," "Child Labor," etc., are all relatively successful creations because the authors have a relatively deep understanding or are familiar with this aspect of the characters in real life. However, there are still many authors who are indifferent to the reality of struggle and the lives of the people, and it is therefore difficult for them to carry out rich ideas in creation. The images under their pens lack a real feeling and lose the power to move people.

    Comic books must be more popular so that readers with an elementary school education can read them directly. The theme must be clear, and the narration must be clear. The continuity between the plot and the panels should be strengthened to avoid too much jumping and too many flashbacks. The text should be popular and concise so that readers can read it and understand it, avoiding lengthy sentences, Westernized inversions, clichés, and local dialects. The image on the screen should be as close as possible to the masses' preferences and appreciation habits. Although more attention has been paid to diversification in the form of expression, some authors regard the expression methods of Western painting as the only "advanced" form, one-sidedly pursuing it, neglecting or even abandoning the characteristics of national painting. We advocate the multi-faceted development of forms of expression, but it must be combined with the masses' preferences and the inheritance of the excellent traditions of national forms, which will be the correct path. Mr. Lu Xun once talked about comic book authors paying attention to absorbing the advantages of folk "flower paper," embroidered portraits, and painting books, which is of great significance. This issue should be brought to the attention of the authors.

    In addition, it is necessary to vigorously promote the writing of comic book scripts to overcome the current phenomenon of the extreme shortage and low quality of comic book scripts. The script issue is closely related to the above-mentioned issues and is one of the important issues that determines the improvement and development of the comic book industry. Publishing departments should strengthen the organization of writing comic book scripts, and at the same time, they should specifically help existing professional scriptwriters improve their overall accomplishments, so that it is possible to solve the current problems of the quantity and quality of comic book scripts.

    Comic books are popular reading materials loved by the masses. They are not only needed by the people today and shoulder important tasks today. With the rapid improvement of the people's cultural life, they will have a more prosperous and splendid future in the socialist cultural field. Art workers, literary workers, editors and publishers, facing the vast number of readers, especially the five hundred million farmers, working hard to do a good job in comic books is a glorious task!

    要求出版更多更好的连环画
    姜维朴
    近几年来，连环画作品在出版数量上有显著的增加，1952年全国新出版的连环画册约计670多种，连重版共印行2，170多万册，1954年新出近900种，总印数也增加到3，580多万册，1955年据初步统计总印数增加到5，250多万册，仅人民美术出版社和朝花美术出版社新出版的种数和册数，1955年就是1952年的三倍。在内容上和艺术上也有很大的提高，表现社会主义和爱国主义成了连环画的重要主题，并出现了一些故事生动、形象真实、富有教育意义的作品。例如杨兆麟编、丁浩和程十发绘的“老孙归社”林锐改编、张岳健绘的“比比神通”，温勇雄绘的“南云岛上”，柯兰编、罗盘绘的“海上英雄”，董绪贤等编、刘继卣绘的“东郭先生”，徐光玉改编，王绪阳等绘的“童工”，章程改编、顾炳鑫绘的“渡江侦察记”，申申、景启民编绘的“浑河水”，常庚西和张汉青编、肖林绘的“小模范员”，费声福绘的“红旗”等等，都是很受读者欢迎的。但是，目前的连环画不论在数量和质量上，同人民群众的需要相比，实在还相差太远，在编绘方面更有若干问题急待解决。
    首先，连环画必须增加品种和出版数量。由于连环画通俗易懂，便于在短时间读完，加以读者非常广泛——全国大中城市书店书摊的读者每天就有150万到200万人次，而农村读者目前正在开始扩大，没有经常大量出版的新连环画，就没法满足群众的需要。群众需要更多、更好的新作品，而我们有些连环画家却对自己工作的重要性估计不足，有些作者不愿意编绘连环画，认为连环画是低级的，他们孤立地强调提高，要求长期“琢磨”，旷日持久，却连“低级”的作品也不能完成，这种轻视普及工作的现象，必须反对。同时，连环画出版部门要有计划地有分工地组织画家和脚本作者大量地认真地编绘连环画，出版和发行部门要克服右倾保守思想，特别要认识农业社会主义改造的伟大胜利和扫盲运动在各地大力展开以后给农村带来的新的情况，大量地向农民供应足够的通俗读物，是目前不容许再迟缓的事了。
    连环画必须加强反映当前现实，以鼓舞和教育广大人民为社会主义事业而斗争。目前，很多连环画作品还不能生动有力地表现出当前现实生活中的重大事件，例如反映农业合作化运动的连环画就很少，有的也还多半在表现部分农民在合作化运动中动摇、犹豫的一面，而远远落在运动高潮的后面。伟大的工业建设是连环画题材中最薄弱的一环，除了反映解放前后和解放初期工业生产部门的护厂斗争、反特斗争等少数作品外，对近几年来工人的劳动竞赛、创造发明、为提前和超额完成五年计划而在各个劳动战线上出现的英雄人物、模范事迹，还极少从连环画中看到。表现肃反斗争的作品，出现过一些新闻报道性的短篇，还需要故事内容丰富动人的作品，以进一步教育群众提高警惕，加强同国内外敌人斗争。当然，我们也不反对采用历史题材和民间故事来编绘连环画，以满足群众多方面的喜爱；成套地编绘长篇故事如“水浒”那样的画集，是群众所欢迎的。连环画的题材范围确是应该扩大，使连环画的内容丰富多样，但是反映当前现实的题材仍然应当是主要的，历史题材也要选择有意义的。
    连环画必须提高质量。粗制滥造、滥竽充数的编绘作风必须加以严厉反对。我们要求连环画要有强烈的故事性和生动的情节，“鸡毛信”这部连环画所以受到读者广泛的喜爱，主要原因便是具有这一特点。有些连环画作品缺乏故事情节，概念地和枯燥乏味地记录事件或解说政策，虽然企图表现什么重要主题，却难以感动读者，不能给读者以深刻的印象。同时，连环画既是主要依靠画面形象来表现内容，形象的刻划便应该是作者重要的创造性的劳动。必须要求作者对故事内容和故事中的人物有着深刻的了解。连环画“老孙归社”里的单干农民形象，“比比神通”里的领导干部形象，“南云岛上”的海军指战员形象，“东郭先生”、“童工”等的人物形象，都是作者有了比较深入的体会或在现实生活中熟悉了这方面的人物，才有比较成功的创造。但是目前还有不少作者，同现实斗争和人民群众的生活漠不相关，在创作上因而难以进行丰富的构思，笔下的形象缺乏真实的感觉，失去动人的力量。
    连环画必须更通俗，使具有小学文化程度的读者都能直接阅读。主题一定要明朗，叙述一定要清楚；要加强情节和画幅之间的连续性，避免跳越太大和过多的倒叙。文字应通俗简练，使读者能够读得出，听得懂，避免冗长的句子、洋化的倒装句和陈词滥调、方言僻语。画面形象应尽量切合群众的喜爱和欣赏习惯。在表现形式上目前虽然比较重视了多样化，但也有些作者把西洋画的表现方法视为唯一的“高级”形式，片面追求，忽视了甚至舍弃了民族绘画的特点。我们提倡表现形式的多方面的发展，但必须结合群众的喜爱和继承民族形式的优良传统，才会是正确的道路。鲁迅先生曾谈到连环画作者应注意吸取民间的“花纸”、绣像和画本的优点，这是有重要意义的，这一问题更应引起作者们的注意。
    此外，必须大力提倡连环画脚本的编写工作，克服目前连环画脚本数量奇缺和质量不高的现象。脚本问题是同上述几个问题密切关联，决定连环画事业提高和发展的重要问题之一，出版部门应加强编写连环画脚本的组织工作，同时对现有专业的脚本编写人员，应具体帮助他们提高各方面的修养，这样才有可能解决目前连环画脚本的数量和质量问题。
    连环画是群众喜爱的普及读物，它不仅在今天为人民所需要，不仅在今天担负着重大的任务，随着人民文化生活的迅速提高，它在社会主义的文化领域中将有着更繁荣绚烂的将来。美术工作者们、文学工作者们、编辑出版工作者们，面对着广大读者，特别是五亿农民，努力搞好连环画的工作，是一项光荣的任务！
