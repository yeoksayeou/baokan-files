To the Editor:

    The environmental sanitation work in the Zhangjiakou Flour Mill's workshop is very poor, which seriously affects the health of workers and wastes the state's grain.

    This factory has two production workshops: the wheat building and the flour building. The wheat cleaning machine in the wheat building often causes dust to fly, and the flour milling machine in the flour building also often spews out a large amount of flour. Workers work in workshops full of dust and flour, and their health has been damaged. According to incomplete statistics, the number of workers suffering from tracheitis in the past year accounted for more than 10% of the total number of workers in the entire workshop. In addition, thousands of kilograms of flour are wasted every year.

    Regarding this issue, the employees have raised many opinions. During the inter-factory competition, people from fraternal factories also made suggestions for improvement when they visited and inspected the work. However, these opinions have not aroused the attention of the factory leaders. I hope that Zhangjiakou Flour Mill will quickly take effective measures to improve the environmental sanitation of the workshop and eliminate the phenomenon of wasting flour.

    赶快消除车间里的粉尘编辑同志：
    张家口面粉厂车间环境卫生工作做得很不好，以致严重地影响工人身体健康，并且浪费了国家的粮食。
    这个工厂有麦楼和粉楼两个生产车间。麦楼里的清麦机经常尘土飞扬，粉楼里的磨粉机中也常常飞出大量的面粉。工人们在满是尘土和面粉的车间中工作，健康受到了损害，据不完全统计，去年一年内患气管炎的工人就占全车间工人总数的10％以上。另外一年中浪费的面粉也有几千斤。
    对于这个问题，职工们曾经提过很多意见，在厂际竞赛中，兄弟厂来人参观和检查工作的时候也提出过改进意见。但是，这些意见都没有引起工厂领导方面的重视。我希望张家口面粉厂迅速采取有效措施，来改进车间的环境卫生和杜绝浪费面粉的现象。  一读者
