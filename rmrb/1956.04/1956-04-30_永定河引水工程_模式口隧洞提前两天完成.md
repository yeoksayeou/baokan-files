    Yongding River Water Diversion Project
    Moshikou Tunnel Completed Two Days Ahead of Schedule
    The Moshikou Tunnel of the Yongding River Water Diversion Project was completed on April 29th, two days ahead of schedule, fulfilling the guarantee to offer a gift to "May Day."
    The Moshikou Tunnel is a key project in the Yongding River Water Diversion Project. The river water diverted from the Yongding River is blocked by the Moshikou Mountain and cannot move forward. A tunnel more than a li long must be excavated here to divert the water to Beijing.
    At the general meeting of all employees on the 29th, the responsible comrades of the Yongding River Water Diversion Project Headquarters congratulated the workers and presented two red flags, encouraging them to: continue their efforts and strive to ensure water inflow by "July 1st"!

    永定河引水工程
    模式口隧洞提前两天完成
    永定河引水工程模式口隧洞，在四月二十九日提前两天打通，完成了向“五一”献礼的保证。
    模式口隧洞是永定河引水工程中的关键工程，由永定河引来的河水，被模式口大山挡住不能前进，必须在这里开凿一条长达一里多路的山洞，才能把水引到北京城内。
    二十九日在全体职工大会上，永定河引水工程指挥部的负责同志向工人们祝贺，并赠给红旗两面，勉励他们：继续努力，为保证“七一”进水而奋斗！（马耘、汪文廉）
