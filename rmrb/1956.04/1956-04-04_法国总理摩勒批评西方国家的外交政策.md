Xinhua News Agency, 3rd (Washington dispatch) The latest issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine published a record of French Premier Mollet's conversation with the magazine's reporters. In the conversation, Mollet criticized the foreign policies of Western countries.

Mollet said that Britain and France, especially the United States, "made methodological mistakes" in their policies toward the Soviet Union. He said that Americans are so suspicious that they always say "no" whenever the Soviet Union makes a proposal. This situation makes people all over the world think that the Soviet Union wants peace and the United States opposes peace. He called for a revision of Western countries' attitudes toward the Soviet Union.

He said that France's "basic principles of foreign policy remain unchanged," "but (France) is trying to get its partners in the Atlantic world to change their attitudes."

Mollet called for attention to the issue of disarmament, saying that if we first solve the disarmament problem, "it will be easier to solve the problem of European security, and within a safe range, the reunification of Germany will also become easier to achieve."

Mollet said that the trade and aid proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the Middle East and Asia have made a deep impression in these regions, while Western countries have "done very badly" there and "are seen as terrible colonialists." Western countries are competing with each other and are "preparing to set the entire Middle East on fire" for oil. He said: The French government does "not intend to sever its alliance with Britain and the United States, but it intends to tell Britain and the United States: If we continue like this, we will lose." He advocated distributing aid to backward areas through the United Nations.

Speaking of Franco-American relations, Mollet expressed dissatisfaction with the "bad behavior" of some American officials in France. Mollet said: These people "take a lecturing attitude towards everyone. And that is not a very popular thing, especially in an old country like ours that absolutely believes it has been playing a role of permanent significance in the world."

Reuters commented on Mollet's conversation, saying, "Mollet's remarks that the Western method is wrong seem to support the recent appeal of his Foreign Minister Pineau, who called for a complete change in the foreign policy of the allies."

    法国总理摩勒批评西方国家的外交政策
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：最新一期“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志刊登了法国总理摩勒对这家杂志记者的谈话纪录。摩勒在谈话中批评了西方国家的外交政策。
    摩勒说，英国和法国，特别是美国，在它们对苏联的政策中“犯了方法的错误”。他说，美国人是如此多疑，每当苏联提出一项建议时他们总是说“不”。这种情况使得全世界人民认为苏联希望和平而美国反对和平。他要求修改西方国家对苏联的态度。
    他说，法国“外交政策的基本原则仍然没有变”，“但是（法国）正在设法使大西洋世界中的伙伴们改变它们的态度”。
    摩勒要求重视裁军问题，他说，如果我们首先解决裁军问题，“那么解决欧洲安全问题就比较容易了，而且在安全的范围内，德国的重新统一也将变得比较容易实现”。
    摩勒说，苏联在中东和亚洲所提出的贸易和援助的建议在这些地区造成深刻的印象，而西方国家在那里“做得很糟糕”，“被看成可怕的殖民主义者”。西方国家在彼此进行竞争，为了石油“正在准备使整个中东燃烧起来”。他说：法国政府并“不打算断绝它同英国和美国的联盟，但是它打算告诉英国和美国：如果我们像这样继续下去，我们就会输掉”。他主张通过联合国来分配给落后地区的援助。
    在谈到法美关系的时候，摩勒对美国在法国的一些官员的“行为不好”表示不满。摩勒说：这些人“对每个人都采取教训的态度。而那是不大为人喜欢的事情，特别是在像我们的国家这样一个古老的国家绝对相信它一直在世界上发挥着它具有永久意义的作用的时候。”
    路透社在评论摩勒这篇谈话的时候说，“摩勒所说的西方的方法有错误这一番话看来是在支持他的外交部长比诺最近的呼吁，比诺要求彻底改变盟国的外交政策”。
