Make the Beijing Dongxiao City Market More Active
		Jia Guifa

	Before liberation, the Beijing Dongxiao City was a distribution center for handicrafts. After liberation, the market's business became increasingly prosperous.
	According to the statistics of 1952, there were a total of 3,000 stallholders in the entire market. Among them, about 2,000 were handicraftsmen, mostly setting up stalls in the market in the morning and returning home to produce in the afternoon. Among the wholesale customers, commercial enterprises and peddlers from other places accounted for 80%; they came from the vast rural areas of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Gansu, Hunan, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Shaanxi and Northeast provinces, as well as cities such as Tianjin, Xi'an, Shenyang, Jinzhou, Harbin, Changchun, and Jiamusi. On average, more than 5,000 people entered and exited the market every day, with a daily turnover of about 42,000 yuan. In 1953, the average daily turnover reached more than 63,000 yuan. Some products, such as hats and fly swatters, were transported by air by merchants during the peak season.
	The Dongxiao City market has the following characteristics: (1) A wide variety of products, complete in designs and colors, including 27 major categories and 3,900 varieties of cotton textiles, knitwear, stationery, metal products, shoes, hats, clothing, and daily necessities. Purchasers can easily buy all the goods they need here. (2) Low wholesale starting point, transactions can be made with as few as three to five pieces; transaction procedures are very simple, selecting goods from samples and taking them on the spot. (3) The product specifications and styles are suitable for the needs of the majority of farmers, and the prices are cheap, which is in line with the current rural living standards. For example, there are children's socks at nine jiao per dozen; and hats at more than three yuan per dozen.
	In recent years, the Dongxiao City market, in the reorganization and transformation of the national economy, especially in the upsurge of the joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce and the cooperative movement of handicrafts nationwide, has undergone some changes. First of all, since 1953, the position of capitalist wholesale commerce has been replaced by state-owned commerce. The business of Dongxiao City with private wholesalers has gradually decreased to zero. In 1955, the wholesale customers from other places were limited to small merchants and peddlers from nearby provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, Rehe, and Inner Mongolia, and the market's business became increasingly deserted. Secondly, at the end of 1955, private commercial enterprises in various places entered the upsurge of socialist transformation, which once disrupted the original production and sales relationship. The number of small merchants and peddlers who came to purchase goods suddenly decreased, and the market became even more deserted. In January this year, in the upsurge of the cooperative movement of handicrafts in Beijing, many handicraftsmen who originally set up stalls in the market were busy forming cooperatives, and some had already joined the cooperatives and concentrated on production. There was a phenomenon of surrendering stall licenses and withdrawing stalls in the market. According to the statistics at that time, more than 100 of the 1,700 handicraftsmen in the entire market had withdrawn their stalls; and many stalls often did not display products because of the small amount of business. In this way, the market's business became less and less, and even the nearby food stalls and bicycle parking attendants had no business to do.
	In order to restore the operating characteristics of the Dongxiao City market, under the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee, and with the support of the Chongwen District Committee of the Communist Party of China, we first conducted a survey of the market situation. Immediately afterwards, we convened meetings of various professional joint cooperatives to study the situation, and decided that all handicraftsmen who had previously set up stalls in the market should still set up stalls after joining the cooperative, and try to let the original personnel come out to operate. At the same time, ten professional joint cooperatives, such as the Department Store Joint Cooperative, also added new stalls in the market. The next day, 81 grassroots cooperatives and 10 professional joint cooperatives in various industries set up 91 large stalls (occupying an area of about 1,240 small stalls), displaying more than 2,440 products, more than double the amount before the restoration. At the same time, the original half-day business hours in the morning were extended to 4 pm. On the other hand, the cooperatives sent letters to other places, informing the original customers of the market's recovery.
	After the restoration work, the Dongxiao City market showed a new look. Small merchants and peddlers from other places continued to come to purchase goods. On the first day after the restoration, according to the statistics of 11 cooperatives, the turnover was 1,800 yuan; the next day it increased to 2,800 yuan. Later, the daily increase, from January 25 to March 10, the total wholesale volume of the cooperatives was 420,000 yuan, an average of about 10,000 yuan per day. Judging from the current situation of the market, there are a total of 2,526 stallholders in the entire market, including 397 wholesale stallholders of joint state-private ownership, joint purchase and sales, and consignment sales, accounting for 16% of the total number of stalls; 91 stalls of handicrafts cooperatives, including 1,734 members, accounting for 68% of the total number of stalls; and another 140 self-produced and self-sold individual handicraftsmen. There are 29 major categories and more than 3,000 varieties of products on display, of which handicrafts from Beijing account for 70%, and light industrial products or handicrafts from other places operated by joint state-private stallholders account for 30%. At present, the average daily sales volume of the entire market is about 40,000 yuan, of which handicrafts cooperatives account for about one-third, and the commodity value of joint state-private stallholders is larger (mainly industrial products), accounting for slightly less than two-thirds. The commodity sales areas are mainly Tongxian Prefecture, Baoding, Handan and the near suburbs of Beijing in Hebei. Recently, state-owned and joint state-private stores in Beijing have also gradually come to the market to purchase goods. Only customers from Henan, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Northeast China have come from other provinces.
	After the restoration of the Dongxiao City market, there are still the following main problems:
	(1) There are still certain obstacles to the meeting of production and sales. In the past, the merchants from various places who came to Dongxiao City have all become joint state-private ownership, and their purchase of goods is restricted by state-owned companies. Xie Xuezeng, a purchasing agent from the Shenglihao Joint State-Private Enterprise in Baoding, reflected that when purchasing goods in Beijing, it is necessary to first make a plan, report to the planning section of the company for review, the business section approves, and then transfer to the wholesale department for verification. Only when the company is indeed short of goods or there are no similar goods to replace them is it allowed to directly purchase goods. Xie Xuezeng used to come to Dongxiao City every four or five days, but now he only comes once or twice a month. In January, after the Xinglong Store in Baotou purchased more than 600 yuan of goods in Dongxiao City, they received a letter from their store saying that there was no plan, and the company did not allow the purchase, so they returned the goods. We advocate direct meeting of production and sales, allowing grassroots stores in various places to freely select and purchase directly in Dongxiao City, which is beneficial to meeting consumer needs and to commercial operations and handicrafts production.
	(2) Due to the increase in rural purchasing power, some commodities are out of stock. The city's cotton textile cooperative can only produce 200 plates of hat bands per month, while before the Spring Festival, 120 plates were sold in the market in one day. Although the monthly output of small shoelaces has increased from 800 luo to more than 2,200 luo, it still cannot meet the needs. In particular, cheap products sold to rural areas, such as towels at two or three jiao each, are even more in short supply. If this contradiction in production and sales is not resolved with effective measures, it will inevitably expand day by day. Our handicrafts cooperatives must fully estimate the increase in rural purchasing power and gradually increase the production of various products, especially cheap products, to meet the needs of the vast rural areas.
	(3) Price issues. Some commodities have different prices for the same goods. For example, the watercolor paints of the Cultural and Educational Joint Cooperative are sold in the market for 1.2 yuan per dozen, while some stallholders purchase this kind of commodity from the Joint Cooperative and also sell it in the market for 1.4 yuan per dozen. There are many similar situations. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the price management of the market, and the prices of the same goods should be consistent.
	(4) There are too many business personnel in the cooperatives, resulting in waste. For example, two bamboo and rattan cooperatives have six business personnel in the market, and the daily sales volume is only about 100 yuan. Eighteen units of the Department Store Joint Cooperative have 44 business personnel in the market, and the daily sales volume is only about 1,000 yuan. Seven units of the Metal Joint Cooperative have eight business personnel, and the daily sales volume is only more than 100 yuan. Therefore, the expenses are large, and the income cannot cover the operating costs. In the future, each professional joint cooperative should combine small stalls into large stalls according to the business situation, and reduce a part of the business personnel back to the cooperative to participate in production.

    让北京东晓市市场更加活跃起来
    贾贵发
    解放前，北京东晓市就是一个手工业品的集散地。解放后，市场的业务日趋繁荣。
    据1952年的统计，全市场共有三千户摊商。其中手工业户约有二千户左右，多是上午在市场摆摊，下午回家生产。批发对象中，外埠商业和小贩占80％；他们来自河北、山西、山东、河南、甘肃、湖南、湖北、内蒙古、宁夏、陕西和东北各省的广大农村，以及天津、西安、沈阳、锦州、哈尔滨、长春、佳木斯等城市。市场上每天平均出入的人有五千多，每日交易额四万二千元左右。1953年，平均每日交易额达到六万三千多元，有些产品如帽子、蝇拍等，在旺季里，商贩们用飞机运输。
    东晓市市场有以下特点：（1）产品种类多、花色齐全，包括棉织、针织、文教用品、金属制品、鞋帽、服装、日用小百货等二十七大类，三千九百多种，采购者在这里很容易把需要的货买全。（2）批发起点低，够三、五件即可交易；交易手续十分简便，看样选购，就地取货。（3）产品规格式样适合广大农民需要，价格便宜，适应当前农村生活水平。例如，有九角钱一打的小孩袜子；有三元多一打的帽子。
    几年来，东晓市市场，在国民经济的改组改造中，特别是全国资本主义工商业公私合营和手工业合作化运动高潮中，发生了一些变化。首先，自1953年以后，资本主义批发商业的阵地为国营商业所代替，东晓市对私营批发商的业务逐步由减少到没有。1955年的外埠批发对象，已经仅限于河北、山西、热河、内蒙古等较近省份的小商小贩，市场的业务日趋冷落。其次，1955年底，各地私营商业进入社会主义改造高潮，曾一度打乱了原有的产销关系，来批货的小商小贩骤然减少，市场更显冷落。今年一月份，北京市手工业合作化高潮中，原在市场摆摊的手工业户，多在忙于组社，有的已经入社集中生产，市场上发生了缴摊照和撤摊的现象。根据当时的统计，全市场一千七百多户手工业者，有一百多户撤了摊子；还有很多摊子因为业务少，经常不摆出产品。就这样，市场的业务越来越少，连附近饭摊和看自行车的都没有生意可做。
    为了恢复东晓市的经营特点，根据中共北京市委和市人民委员会的指示，在中共崇文区区委支持下，我们先对市场情况做了调查。随即召开了各专业联社会议，研究了情况，决定凡过去在市场摆摊的手工业户，参加合作社后，仍然一律把摊子摆起来，并且尽量让原来的人员出来经营。同时，百货联社等十个专业联社，也在市场上增设了新摊。第二天，各行业中的八十一个基层社和十个专业联社，即摆出了九十一个大摊位（约占原来1，240多个小摊位的面积），摆出的产品有2，440多种，比未恢复前增加了两倍多。同时，把原来上午半天的营业时间，改为延长到下午四时。另一方面，让各社往外埠发信，把市场恢复情况告诉原来的主顾。
    经过恢复工作，东晓市市场出现了新气象，外地的小商小贩，不断前来批货，恢复后的第一天，据十一个合作社的统计，交易额为一千八百元；第二天增为二千八百元。后来每日增加，从一月二十五日到三月十日，合作社的批发总额共四十二万元，平均每日约一万元。从现在市场的情况看，全场共有摊位2，526户，其中公私合营、联购联销和代销的批发摊商397户，占总摊位数的16％；手工业合作社九十一个摊位，包括社员1，734户，占总摊位数的68％；另有自产自销的单干手工业户140户，摆出的产品有二十九大类三千多个品种，其中本市手工业品占70％，公私合营摊商经营的轻工业品或外埠手工业品占30％。目前全市场平均每日销货额约四万元，其中手工业合作社约占三分之一，公私合营摊商的商品价值较大（主要是工业品），约占三分之二弱。商品销售地区主要是河北通县专区、保定、邯郸和北京近郊一带。最近本市国营和公私合营商店等，也逐渐到市场进货。外省仅河南、山西、内蒙古、东北等地有顾客来。
    东晓市市场恢复以后，目前还有以下几个主要问题：
    （1）产销见面还有一定的阻碍。过去各地来东晓市的商贩都公私合营了，他们进货受到国营公司的限制。保定公私合营胜利号采购员谢学增反映，到北京进货要先做计划，报公司计划科审查，业务科批准，然后转批发部核对，确属公司缺货或无同类商品代替的时候，才许直接进货。谢学增过去每四、五天到东晓市来一趟，现在一个月才来一两趟。一月份，包头兴隆商店在东晓市进了六百多元的货后，接到本店来信说，没有计划，公司不让进，因而退货。我们提倡产销直接见面，让各地基层商店自由到东晓市直接选购，这对满足消费者需要和对商业经营以及手工业生产，都有好处。
    （2）由于农村购买力提高，有些商品脱销。全市棉织社每月只能生产帽带二百盘，而在春节前，市场上一天就卖了一百二十盘。小鞋带的月产量虽然由八百罗增加到二千二百多罗，但是仍不能满足需要。特别是销于农村的廉价产品，如二、三角钱一条的毛巾等更供不应求。这种产销上的矛盾，如不采取有效措施加以解决，势必日将扩大。我们手工业合作社必须充分估计农村购买力提高的情况，逐步增加各类产品，特别是廉价产品的生产量，以满足广大农村的需要。
    （3）价格问题。有些商品同货异价，如文教联社的水彩画颜色，在市场上售价每打一元二角，而有些摊贩由该联社进的此种商品，也摆在市场上卖，每打一元四角。类似这样的情况很多。今后必须加强市场的价格管理工作，相同的货品，价格应该一致。
    （4）合作社的业务人员多，有浪费现象。如两个竹藤社在市场上有六个业务员，每天销货额只一百元左右。百货联社十八个单位在市场上有四十四个业务员，每天销货额只一千元左右。金属联社七个单位设了八个业务员，每天销货额只一百多元。因此，开支大，收益顶不住经营费用。今后各个专业联社应该根据业务情况，把小摊联成大摊，减下一部业务人员回社参加生产。
