Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 31st:

    The "Wall Street Journal," in commenting on the Icelandic parliament's resolution demanding the withdrawal of US troops from Iceland, said that this step "can remind people that all American bases abroad are necessarily built on shaky ground, and that this ground may become more shaky as time passes."
    The newspaper then recounted the attitudes of Britain and France towards the presence of US troops. It said, "The presence of American troops in France itself has never made the country feel happy. The pressure on American bases in Britain has long been obvious."
      The "Wall Street Journal" acknowledged that it is only natural for countries to oppose the presence of American troops in other countries. The newspaper mentioned the words of the Icelandic Foreign Minister: "One of the reasons for demanding the withdrawal of American troops is that international tensions have eased since the Geneva Conference last summer."

    美国“华尔街日报”的评论说
    美国在国外建立基地不受欢迎
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社纽约31日讯：
  “华尔街日报”在评论冰岛议会要求美国军队撤出冰岛的决议时说，这个步骤“可以提醒人们，美国在国外的所有基地必然是建筑在动摇不定的土地上，而这种土地随着时间的消逝可能会变得更加动摇不定”。
    这家报纸接着追述了英国和法国国内对美国驻军所抱的态度。它说，“美国军队驻在法国本国从来没有使这个国家感到过欢欣。美国在英国的基地所受的压力早就很明显了。”
      “华尔街日报”承认，各国反对美国军队驻在其他国家是再自然不过的了。这家报纸提到冰岛外交部长所说的话：“要求美国军队撤出的理由之一就是自从去年夏季日内瓦会议以来，国际紧张局势已经有了缓和。”
