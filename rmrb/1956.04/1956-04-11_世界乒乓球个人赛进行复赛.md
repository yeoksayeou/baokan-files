Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The World Table Tennis Championships saw the completion of all semi-final matches today, with the champions in each event set to be decided in tomorrow's finals.

In the men's doubles, Czechoslovakia's Andreadis and Štípek defeated Japan's Toshiaki Tanaka and Keisuke Tsunoda three games to one. Tomorrow, they will face Japan's Ichiro Ogimura (formerly mistranslated as Ichiro Ogimachi) and Yoshio Tomita in the final, vying to retain the world men's doubles title they won in 1955. Ogimura and Tomita secured their place in the championship final after defeating Czechoslovakia's Dvořáček and Vyhnanovský.

Romania's Rozeanu-Zeller team and Japan's Hisako Watanabe-Fujie Eguchi team both advanced through the semi-finals today. They will compete for the women's doubles championship tomorrow. Japan's Ryuko Tanaka-Tomi Okawa team and Britain's Haydon-Dianna team were eliminated in today's semi-finals.

Rozeanu and Zeller, the 1955 world women's doubles champions, played exceptionally well today, defeating Tanaka Ryuko and Okawa Tomi's doubles team three games to zero. Their teamwork was so good that some felt as though one person had four hands.

In the mixed doubles semi-finals, Andreadis and Britain's Haydon defeated Romania's Reteanu and Zeller. They will face America's Klan and Norberg in tomorrow's championship match.

The players competing for the men's and women's singles titles tomorrow are all Japanese: Toshiaki Tanaka and Ichiro Ogimura in the men's category, and Hisako Watanabe and Tomi Okawa in the women's category. The only Romanian female player, Zeller, was defeated by Hisako Watanabe in the semi-finals.

In addition to the main events, men's and women's singles consolation matches were also held today. The consolation matches are held between players who were eliminated in earlier rounds. The matches will determine the consolation champion.

    获得一九五五年世界女子双打冠军的罗齐亚努和齐勒尔，在今天以三比○挫败田中良子和大川富的双打中打的异常出色。她们配合得这样好，以致有人认为她们就像一个人有四只手。
    在混合双打复赛中，安德理阿地斯和英国的海顿打败了罗马尼亚的雷特和齐勒尔。他们将在明天的冠军赛中遇到美国的克拉恩和诺伯格。
    将在明天争夺男、女单打冠军的全是日本选手：男子方面是田中利明和荻村伊智朗，女子方面是渡边妃生子和大川富。唯一的罗马尼亚女选手齐勒尔在复赛中败于渡边妃生子。
