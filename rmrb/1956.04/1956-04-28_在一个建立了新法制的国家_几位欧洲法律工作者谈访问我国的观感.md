In a Country That Has Established a New Legal System
Impressions of Several European Legal Professionals Visiting Our Country
By Our Reporter

"New China is developing rapidly in all aspects, and the progress in judicial work is also astonishingly rapid. The People's Republic of China has been established for only six years, and you have completely abandoned the old legal system and established a new one." This is what British barrister Milner said to reporters when talking about his impressions of visiting China. Milner is one of more than a dozen legal professionals from European countries who recently visited our country. Before leaving China, he, along with British Queen's Counsel and Labour MP Jones, Professor Laski of the Toulouse Law School in France, and French lawyer Sarot, received reporters from this newspaper.

During their time in China, these legal professionals held seminars with our legal workers to study our laws and judicial system. They also visited our courts, observed trials, and visited our prisons and labor reform institutions, where they talked with prisoners. Sarot said: "Whether in terms of legal principles or the manner of trials, it has given me a very deep and good impression."

One of the things that deeply impressed these guests was the popular nature of our country's legislative and judicial work. Milner said: "You not only formulate laws based on the interests and needs of the people, but also submit the drafted laws to the people for extensive discussion. When enforcing the law, you also attach great importance to the opinions of the people. For example, your implementation of the people's assessor system is a good proof of this." He pointed out that because the laws are in line with the interests of the majority of people, they can be supported and abided by by the people. Several foreign friends were deeply impressed by the Chinese people's spirit of abiding by the law. Jones cited an incident he personally experienced. When he was in Shanghai, he once took out a notebook from his pocket on the street and accidentally dropped a dime. After he had walked thirty or forty yards, a child chased after him and returned the dime he had picked up. He asked the child to accept the dime as a gift, but the child firmly refused. Jones said: "Although this is a small matter, it shows how Chinese citizens abide by laws and public order."

Several lawyers talked about the solemn but humane atmosphere in our courts. Jones said: "I have observed the trial of three cases. I saw that the judge's attitude was stern, the interrogation was patient, and no pressure was exerted on the defendant in any way. The defendant was also able to speak freely." Milner added: "Your courts are full of the spirit of humanism." However, Jones believes that defense lawyers could have more room for activity before the trial. He pointed out that our country conducts more detailed investigation work before trying cases, which is different from the litigation procedures in the United Kingdom. However, French professors Sarot and Laski believe that China's approach is somewhat similar to that of some continental European countries such as Belgium and Italy. They expressed satisfaction with the fact that our country is vigorously establishing lawyers' organizations so that every party in a case can have a lawyer to defend them. Jones also said that he had talked with some friends in our country who are engaged in judicial education and knew that they are working hard to cultivate judicial talents. He hopes that we will soon have a large number of high-quality lawyers participating in judicial work. Jones and Milner also pointed out that our country's current written laws are not yet complete, but they know that the drafting of criminal and civil laws is underway.

Talking about our country's policy towards criminals, Jones said: "I very much agree with your practice of carrying out labor reform for criminals. You make prisoners learn various skills and do some constructive work, which is much better than simple imprisonment." Milner also believes that it is completely correct to adopt a reform policy that combines punishment and education for criminals.

In terms of overall impression, they expressed that they were deeply moved by the Chinese people's enthusiasm and vitality in building their motherland. Jones said that he had visited the construction project of the Yangtze River flood control dam and saw that people were working there so happily and with such enthusiasm. He also said: Every Chinese person they met expressed their friendship to them so sincerely, "As long as they were able to smile, no matter old or young, they welcomed us with a smile." Therefore, he believes that it is very beneficial for people of all countries to have more contact and exchanges. Sarot said: "The impression I gained from this visit to China can increase the French people's understanding of the Chinese people."

Finally, several legal professionals stated that legal professionals from all countries should contribute to strengthening world peace and international cooperation. Jones said solemnly: "Legal professionals are not only responsible for domestic tranquility, but also responsible for international peace. We should uphold the principles of international law so that these principles can be implemented. From the perspective of legal professionals, all countries should respect each other and not interfere in each other's internal affairs. Only by peaceful coexistence can people coexist in this era of atomic and hydrogen bombs."

    在一个建立了新法制的国家
    几位欧洲法律工作者谈访问我国的观感
    本报记者
    “新中国在各方面都是在飞跃地发展，司法工作方面的进步也是惊人地迅速的。中华人民共和国成立仅仅六年多，你们已经完全废弃了旧的法制，建立起了新的法制。”这是英国辩护律师米尔纳对记者谈到他访问中国的观感时说的。米尔纳是最近到我国来访问的十多位欧洲国家法律工作者之一。他同英国的皇室律师、工党议员琼斯，法国突鲁斯法学院教授拉斯克和法国律师萨罗特等在离开中国之前接见了本报记者。
    这几位法律工作者在中国期间，曾经同我国的法律工作者举行座谈，研究了我国的法律和司法制度。他们并且访问了我们的法院，旁听过案件的审判，参观了我们的监狱和劳动改造机构，同犯人进行过交谈。萨罗特说：“不论是法律的原则方面，或者审判的方式方面，都给予我很深刻和良好的印象。”
    使这些客人得到深刻印象的事情之一是我国立法工作和司法工作的人民性。米尔纳说：“你们不仅根据人民的利益和需要来制定法律，而且起草了法律之后，还交给人民展开广泛的讨论。在执行法律的时候，也十分重视人民的意见。例如你们实行人民陪审员的制度就是很好的证明。”他指出，因为法律符合于大多数人的利益，所以能够为人民所拥护和遵守。几位外国朋友对于中国人民的守法精神有很深的印象。琼斯举出了一件他亲身经历的事情。他在上海的时候，有一次在街上从口袋掏笔记本，不小心遗落了一毛钱。等他走了有三四十码远，一个小孩追上来把拣到的那一毛钱交还给他。他要求那个小孩把那一毛钱作为礼物收下，但是那个小孩坚决谢绝了。琼斯说：“这虽是一件小事情，但是可以说明中国的公民是怎样的遵守法律和公共秩序。”
    几位律师谈到了我国法庭中的庄严而又富有人情味的气氛。琼斯说：“我参观过三件案件的审判。我看到法官的态度是严正的，审讯是耐心的，丝毫没有对被告施加任何压力。被告也可以畅所欲言。”米尔纳补充说：“你们的法庭充满着人道主义的精神。”不过琼斯认为辩护律师在开庭前还有可以多作活动的余地。他指出我国在审判案件前进行较详细的侦讯工作，这一点同英国的诉讼程序有所不同。然而法国的萨罗特和拉斯克教授则认为中国的做法和欧洲某些大陆国家如比利时和意大利有些相像。他们对于我国正在大力建立律师组织，以便使每一件案件的当事人都能够有律师为之辩护，表示满意。琼斯并且说，他曾经和我国一些从事司法教育工作的朋友交谈，知道他们在努力培养司法工作的人才。他希望我们很快就会有大量质量很好的律师参加司法工作。琼斯和米尔纳又指出我国目前成文的法律还不完全，但是知道正在进行刑法和民法的起草工作。
    谈到我国对待罪犯的政策，琼斯说： “我很赞同你们对罪犯进行劳动改造的做法。你们使犯人学习各种技术，做一些建设性的工作，比单纯的囚禁好得多。”米尔纳也认为对罪犯采取惩罚与教育相结合的改造政策是完全正确的。
    在总的印象方面，他们表示深为中国人民建设祖国的热情和活力所感动。琼斯说，他曾经去参观过长江防洪堤的建设工程，看到人们都是那样地愉快、那样地怀着充沛的热情从事劳动。他还说：他们所遇到的每一个中国人都是那样真诚地对他们表示友好，“只要是会笑的人，不论老幼，都用微笑来欢迎我们。”因此他认为，各国人民多一些接触和来往有很大好处。萨罗特说：“我这次到中国来访问所得到的印象能够增加法国人民对中国人民的了解。”
    最后，几位法律工作者都表示，各国的法律工作者应该对于加强世界和平和国际合作作出贡献。琼斯很郑重地说：“法律工作者不仅对国内的安宁负有责任，而且对国际的和平也负有责任。我们应该维护国际法的原则，使这些原则得以实行。从法律工作者的观点来看，各国应当互相尊重，互不干涉内政。只有这样和平共处，人们才能够在这个原子弹和氢弹的时代共存。”
