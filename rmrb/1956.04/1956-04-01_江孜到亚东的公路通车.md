    Highway from Gyantse to Yadong Opens to Traffic

    The entire highway from Gyantse to Yadong in Tibet was officially opened to traffic on March 29. When more than 30 trucks loaded with supplies passed through the heavy valleys of the Himalayas and arrived in Yadong, cheers erupted from the crowds who had been waiting along the road since morning to welcome them. They presented thousands of hadas to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the decorated vehicles. At 1 p.m., people from all walks of life in Yadong, as well as farmers and herdsmen who had come from afar from the Himalayan mountains, held a celebration rally with the road construction workers to mark the opening of the highway. Folk artists also performed Tibetan opera and lion dances. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    江孜到亚东的公路通车
    西藏江孜到亚东的公路三月二十九日全线正式通车。当三十多辆载满物资的汽车穿过喜马拉雅山的重重山谷开到亚东的时候，从清晨就在公路两旁欢迎的人群里响起了一片欢呼声，他们向彩车上的毛主席像献了上千条哈达。下午一时，亚东各界人民和从喜马拉雅山区远道赶来的农民、牧民，与筑路人员一起举行了通车庆祝大会，民间艺人们还表演了藏戏和狮子舞。　（据新华社讯）
