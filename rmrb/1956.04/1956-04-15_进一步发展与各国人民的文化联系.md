Further Develop Cultural Ties with People of All Countries
Chen Zhongjing

I

Our country has a long tradition of cultural ties with foreign countries. According to written records, this history spans over two thousand years. Over the past six years, the Chinese people, as masters of their own country, have developed cultural ties with many countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. Their spiritual outlook, scale, and content are all vastly different from the past.

We advocate free and equal cultural exchange. This kind of cultural exchange is a common aspiration of human civilization and an irresistible trend. Its primary goal is to enhance mutual understanding, eliminate estrangement and distance, and thereby strengthen peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries. For example, the recent visit and performance of the Chinese Art Troupe in many European countries received widespread praise and acclaim. An Indian friend wrote an article in Paris, saying it was a great victory where "art conquered bombs." The American "Sunday New York Times" (July 17, 1955) also published photos of the Chinese Peking Opera "At the Crossroads" and other countries' plays performed at the Paris Drama Festival, stating in its dispatch: "Actors from the United States, Communist China, Finland, Poland, and many other countries appeared on stage. At the reception that evening, actors from France, China, East Germany, and the United States drank and laughed together, as if the Iron Curtain were only a thin veil." Another important goal of cultural ties is to mutually enrich and prosper the cultural lives of the people of all countries. For us, cultural ties are of great significance to China's socialist construction. In "On New Democracy," Chairman Mao talked about the need for Chinese culture to unite with the progressive cultures of all other nations and establish a relationship of mutual absorption and development. He pointed out: "China should absorb a large amount of foreign progressive culture as raw material for its own cultural nourishment. This work has not been done enough in the past." He also said: "Everything that we can use today should be absorbed." Chairman Mao's words clearly pointed out the general direction and goals of our cultural ties with the people of all countries. Today, as we stand in the midst of a surging tide of socialist economic construction and cultural construction, facing the arduous task of catching up with the advanced scientific and cultural level of the world, this instruction is even more important.

Cultural ties are beneficial to the cause of international peace and also to the socialist construction of our motherland. This is a very important matter, and we must carefully and diligently promote it and develop it in all aspects.

II

Over the past six years, our country has had various friendly cultural and artistic exchanges with eighty-six countries. Now, let us briefly discuss them in several aspects:

First, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, up to now, we have sent a total of twenty-eight art troupes, totaling 2,373 people. They have visited and performed in twenty-seven countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa (including most of the countries that have established diplomatic relations and some that have not). In 1955 alone, nine art troupes were sent to 176 cities in twenty-five countries, performing 685 shows for approximately 2,786,745 audience members.

Forty-two art troupes from seventeen countries (the Soviet Union being the most frequent, with ten troupes), totaling 4,238 people, have visited China for performances. In 1955 alone, nineteen art troupes from sixteen countries visited twenty-seven cities in China, performing 455 shows for 1,500,364 audience members.

In the near future, we will continue to invite some foreign art troupes to visit and perform in our country, including art troupes from countries that have never been to our country before. Currently, a problem that must be resolved as much as possible is to enable more people in more regions of our country to see the wonderful performances of these foreign art troupes.

Secondly, another type of cultural exchange with broad mass participation that has flourished in recent years is various sports competitions. People's China's swimming, table tennis, basketball, volleyball, shooting, and motorcycle racing have begun to emerge in international competitions. Many teams have also come to China, including the famous Soviet, Hungarian, and Yugoslavian football teams, the Romanian volleyball team, the Indian table tennis and volleyball teams, and the Burmese football team.

As of now, our country has joined twelve international sports organizations. We plan to participate in the 16th International Olympic Games to be held in Australia this November.

Third, in addition to the above-mentioned artistic performances and sports activities, we have also mutually sent experts and scholars to many countries in the fields of culture, art, education, science, medicine, and journalism for friendly visits and study tours. We have also mutually dispatched students and professors to some countries. This gradually deepening professional exchange is an important feature of cultural ties in recent years. In science, in addition to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, Chinese scientists have visited Japan, Southeast Asia, and some countries in Western Europe. We have mutually sent larger scientific delegations to the Soviet Union and Japan. Over the past six years, Chinese scientists have attended eight major international scientific conferences and participated in international scientific organizations such as astronomy, geology, construction engineering, and the World Federation of Scientific Workers. In terms of news broadcasting, exchanges between journalists have gradually become more frequent over the past six years, and their activities are connected to the broad masses.

Fourth, regarding the exchange of films. Over the past six years, our country has exported more than eighty films, both commercially and non-commercially, with a total of more than 2,100 copies, to nearly sixty countries, including twelve countries in the Americas. Fifteen of our feature films and documentaries have won awards at international film festivals. Over the past six years, our country has translated and dubbed a total of 440 foreign films into Chinese, including ten from India, four from Japan, and three from Italy. We have held film weeks or film exhibitions of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, as well as Indian film weeks. In the future, we will continue to hold film weeks of Japan, France, and other countries.

Fifth, translation, publication, and exchange of books and periodicals. From October 1949 to December 1955, our country translated and published a total of 12,155 books from various countries, totaling 188,538,000 copies. Among them, 10,017 were from the Soviet Union; 620 were from the People's Democratic countries; and 1,518 were from other countries, with the United States being the most numerous, with a total of 562. At the same time, various famous works of our country, both ancient and modern, have also been translated and published in many countries. Taking Japan as an example, from October 1949 to April 1955, 103 Chinese works were translated into Japanese in the field of literature, with a circulation of 530,000 copies, and 62 works in the field of social sciences, with a circulation of 470,000 copies. In terms of the exchange of books and periodicals, over the past six years, the Beijing Library of our country has established exchange relations with 138 units in forty-three countries, and regularly donates publications to 303 units. The library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has established exchange relations of books and periodicals with 472 units in forty-one countries, including the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, the Union of South Africa, Portugal, and other countries.

Sixth, holding exhibitions is also a good way to promote cultural exchange with the masses. Over the past six years, our country has sent nearly 290 exhibitions of various cultural arts and reflections of people's lives to about forty countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, America, and Australia; we have held 85 exhibitions of various cultural arts sent from fifteen countries in our country, with approximately 9.3 million visitors.

Seventh, the exchange of other various cultural materials and even animals. Over the past six years, our country has conducted extensive exchanges with many countries in various cultural and artistic materials (such as musical scores, records, paintings, handicrafts, and written materials). Before 1955, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had already established contact with more than 160 groups (or individuals) in fifteen countries for the exchange of seeds or seed catalogs. In 1955, the Academy of Sciences sent out approximately 602 scientific papers and approximately 2,147 specimens.

Since 1952, our country has established animal exchange relations with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Japan. Over the past five years, the above-mentioned countries have sent a total of 269 animals, and we have sent them 1,674 animals. In addition, mutual donations have been made with some countries.

In addition, the return and donation of historical relics is also a matter worth mentioning in the recent foreign cultural ties of our country. The Soviet Union returned 64 volumes of the "Yongle Encyclopedia" in 1951 and 1954 respectively; Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic returned three volumes of the "Yongle Encyclopedia" and ten free flags from the Boxer Rebellion when he visited China in 1955. This is in good contrast to the fact that some countries plundered China's ancient cultural relics in the past and still occupy them today. At the same time, China donated a large number of Buddhist scriptures to Indian scholar Vella in 1955. This year, the Buddhist Association of China presented nine Buddhist scriptures translated by Cambodian monks Mandara and Sanghavara, who came to China more than 1,400 years ago, to Prince Sihanouk.

III

The Chinese people and their representatives in various fields have done such work in foreign cultural ties in the past few years; they have profound feelings and rich harvests in this regard. Of course, there are shortcomings in these works. In order to do this very important work well, we have examined and summarized some of the activities in the past practice in this regard, and summarized the following points.

First, we must adhere to the principle of mutual respect.

The culture and art of any nation, including music, dance, fine arts, etc., reflects the history and life, creation and struggle of their people. Because of this, we should cherish the national culture of other countries in thought and emotion, just as we cherish our own national culture. For things that we are not yet familiar with or do not fully understand, we should gradually familiarize ourselves with them, deeply understand them, and thus become interested in them until we truly appreciate them and absorb them. For example, Indian music and dance, for most of our laymen, is initially novel and unfamiliar; but when we watch it again and again, listen to it again and again, and at the same time strengthen our understanding of this great country and great culture, we gradually develop a strong interest from understanding. For the cultural achievements of any nation and any country, we must study and learn well. In a broader sense, the degree of genuine respect, appreciation and understanding of the national cultures of other countries should also be one of the symbols of the cultural level of the people of this country.

A related issue is that in various cultural exchange activities, we should fully respect and cherish the suggestions and criticisms made to us by international friends. Even if they are not entirely in line with our reality, we should still warmly welcome them and treat them seriously and conscientiously. We must neither reject them from thousands of miles away, nor should we adopt a perfunctory and negligent attitude. Many foreign friends have made valuable opinions and suggestions on all aspects of life in our country after visiting our country, and many opinions are very pertinent and helpful.

Second, we must also respect ourselves.

Respect for others and respect for oneself are not opposed to each other, but are complementary to each other. We oppose unfounded arrogance, and we also oppose unfounded self-abasement; we must respect and love the cultural traditions of our motherland, create and promote our national culture, and thus enrich the cultural treasure house of mankind in the world. We should admit that our current culture is backward, which is the result of thousands of years of feudal rule and more than 100 years of imperialist oppression and plunder. But we should also fully see the crystallization of the hard work of our working people and artistic masters over the years, leaving us many good things, scattered in the vast four directions of the motherland, waiting to be collected, sorted out and processed and improved; at the same time, we also have full confidence in catching up with the advanced level of world science and culture in a not too long period of time.

We must also have full national self-confidence, fully recognize and value the tradition, characteristics and achievements of our national culture, and make further efforts to process it and continue to develop it forward. Only with such self-confidence can we be brave enough to introduce ourselves and generously introduce our own, even if it is a little bit of achievement, to the people of all countries, so as to enrich the common cultural paradise of mankind.

Our Yue Opera visit to the Soviet Union and the Democratic Germany was greatly welcomed, and was called Chinese "national opera," and was given high praise. But some people in our country are always unwilling to admit that their own opera is opera; and think that only the Western opera that "sings throughout" is the so-called "orthodox" opera. In fact, this is an attitude of contempt for one's own rich national opera, and shows the remaining thoughts of blindly worshiping the West. When Japanese Kabuki visited China for performance, some people compared Chinese opera with Japanese Kabuki, saying that Chinese opera is opera-type, and Japanese Kabuki is musical theater or music and dance theater. President Ouyang Yuqian said it well: Chinese opera is Chinese opera, Japanese Kabuki is Kabuki, both of which are Eastern, each with its own special performance forms and styles of dramatic art, there is no need to reluctantly classify them according to the Western opera form. Mr. Lao She also said in his article "On Rudeness and Conservatism" more than a year ago: "When foreign friends (give opinions on Peking Opera), we immediately do it, without thinking about it, it is also too rude." These words should attract attention.

Of course, respecting oneself is by no means self-imposed, holding on to the old. We must proceed from our own reality and strive to absorb everything useful in foreign culture; but this absorption must go through a certain national form and combine with national characteristics to be useful. We must learn well from people, but we must not learn indiscriminately, and we should not force ourselves to learn what we cannot learn now, and do not arbitrarily change our own things. This is true for drama, music, singing, fine arts, etc. As early as 1942, Chairman Mao said in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Inheriting and drawing on can never become a substitute for one's own creation, and this can never be substituted. In literature and art, the uncritical hard copying and imitation of ancient people and foreigners is the most unpromising and most harmful literary dogmatism and artistic dogmatism." In the practice of foreign cultural ties in the past few years after liberation, many cases have fully proved the correctness of this instruction and spirit.

Third, summarizing the previous two articles, we come to this conclusion: In the work of "cultural ties," whether it is absorbing or introducing, we must adopt a warm, active, scientific, and realistic attitude.

We oppose formalism, oppose only doing superficial work, and should enable each other to learn something in a solid way through cultural exchanges. In this regard, there are great shortcomings in our work. For example, a foreign friend criticized our style of hospitality in individual regions as "hotelism." He said that what he hoped was to really bring back some knowledge, not to bring back a stomach full of yellow wine.

In cultural and friendly activities, we must be able to withstand praise, and we should not get carried away when people praise us, but should treat criticism sincerely and practically, and actively study, think, and adopt them separately. We should never be quick to act as teachers to others, but we should not just nod our heads. "Humility" is necessary, but it is not necessary to be excessive. For example, a foreign cartoonist held a cartoon exhibition in our country. At a symposium held specifically for this exhibition, he sincerely asked Chinese comrades to give opinions on his creation so that he could improve. But he asked again and again, but no one in the audience responded, everyone was full of smiles and said good. So he immediately waved his pen and drew a picture - he himself, carrying a heavy burden on his body, with a big character written on it: "Praise." Many foreign friends have such criticism of us, saying that Chinese people are "too polite." This is worthy of our attention and improvement.

Fourth, we are willing to establish cultural ties and cooperation with any country on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect.

The cultural cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is an important factor in enhancing the friendly relations between our country and the socialist camp and promoting the progress of our socialist construction. Therefore, we will continue to spare no effort to strengthen the cultural ties between our country and the brother countries in the future. In addition, in accordance with the spirit of the final communiqué of the Asian-African Conference, the cultural ties and cooperation between our country and the Asian and African countries will be further developed. Now the Egyptian cultural delegation headed by Professor Xia Wanbei is visiting our country. Soon our country will send the famous Peking Opera troupe to visit and perform in Japan. The cultural ties between our country and the countries in Europe, America and Australia will also be further developed. The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and other relevant groups have already or will soon send invitations to famous theaters in France, Italy and other countries. Famous people in the cultural and educational circles of Australia and New Zealand will also be invited to visit China soon.

What should be particularly pointed out here is that the cultural ties between the Chinese people and the American people have been the weakest in the past few years. This situation is not only unsatisfactory to the Chinese people, but it is conceivable that every fair-minded and insightful person in the United States will not be satisfied. However, the responsibility for this situation does not lie with us. Just two things are enough to illustrate this: On July 8, 1955, with the participation of Mr. Solia, the president of the "Paris Literary Society" in France, and Mr. Jousman, the manager of the "International Cultural Exchange Center" in Belgium, Zhang Zhixiang, the head of the Chinese Art Troupe who was visiting France at that time, and Mr. Brin, the head of the American People's Opera Troupe, signed a "Joint Statement," which stipulates that the American People's Opera Troupe is invited to perform the American opera "Porgy and Bess" in the People's Republic of China in November 1955, and an art troupe of the People's Republic of China is invited to perform Peking Opera and song and dance in the United States during the same period. However, not long after, Mr. Brin asked someone to tell the head of the troupe, Zhang Zhixiang, that he was very sorry that it was impossible to get permission to travel to China for performance at present. Another thing is that in November 1955, the Chinese people held a commemorative conference for the 100th anniversary of the publication of "Leaves of Grass," the famous work of the American democratic poet Whitman. The preparatory committee sent invitations to six famous American cultural figures two months in advance; as a result, none of them could come, and several of them could not make the trip because the US State Department refused to issue passports. The famous writer Waldo Frank was one of the invitees. Afterwards, he wrote a long letter to the "New York Times" (September 11, 1955) in anger, which contained the following paragraph:

"As I reminded Mr. Dulles: In Europe until the end of the eighteenth century, when governments were engaged in 'hot wars,' scientists, scholars, and artists from various countries continued to travel to and from each other. ... China has the same tradition of cultural exchange, but China does not seem to have lost this tradition like the United States. In this important matter, China does not have our kind of 'totalitarianism.' ... If the State Department welcomed this action from Beijing, it would be a visionary and insightful performance."

The US authorities and their mouthpieces have been creating the myth of the so-called "Iron Curtain," but the fact proves that the Iron Curtain that hinders the friendly exchanges between the people of all countries is not elsewhere, but in the United States. Is this not obvious enough?

The Chinese people have always respected and have friendly feelings for the American people and their outstanding representatives in various fields; we are very willing to establish close and friendly ties with them. In the past few years, although the Chinese people have never been guests of the American people; however, the Chinese people are hospitable. We are prepared to continue to invite some American friends to visit China and let them understand the peaceful life and peaceful wishes of the Chinese people. Here, by the way, I would like to say to Mr. Brin that the Chinese people are still looking forward to seeing the performance of "Porgy and Bess."

The wishes of the people and the past facts fully prove that the difference in social systems and ideologies does not hinder the friendly exchanges and cultural ties between the people of all countries. We have many things in common, and we can also conduct friendly and free debates in concrete contacts. For example, in 1954, we invited Professor Ayer, a British philosopher of "logical positivism" from the University of London, to give academic lectures at Peking University. Professor Ayer said that he had also had a debate with our philosopher Professor Jin Yuelin, but "we respect and love each other." This is right, we can freely argue until we are red in the face, but never draw swords; not only do we not hurt harmony, but we want to become friends. This is also the true color of cultural ties, which is worth advocating.

IV

Cultural ties should be widely promoted and carried out in all aspects among the people of all countries. The recommendation of the Cultural Committee of the Berlin Special Meeting of the World Peace Council in May 1954 is good: "Any initiative to further develop national cultural activities and expand cultural exchanges - no matter where this initiative comes from." Speaking of initiatives, speaking of the spirit of advocacy in this regard, we should frankly admit that in some specific tasks, we are not as good as some of our Indian friends, Egyptian friends; we are also not as good as some French friends and Italian friends. In this work, we should be more active and overcome conservative thinking. More people from all walks of life should be absorbed to participate in the activities of foreign cultural ties, domestic cultural groups and departments should establish closer and more direct ties with relevant cultural groups and departments abroad, our experts, scholars and representatives in all fields should conduct more active and closer correspondence with foreign counterparts and colleagues, we should unite more and better old and new friends in international friends through cultural ties, we should learn well from them, and we should also enthusiastically introduce ourselves.

Let us work together to further promote and further strengthen foreign cultural ties. This is beneficial to our socialist construction and also beneficial to maintaining and consolidating international peace.

    进一步发展与各国人民的文化联系
    陈忠经
    一
    我国同外国的文化联系有悠久的传统，按文字记载，也已经有两千多年的历史了。最近六年多来，中国人民作为自己国家的主人，在平等互利、互相尊重的基础上同许多国家发展了文化联系，其精神面貌、规模内容，与过去都大不相同。
    我们主张自由平等的文化联系。这种文化联系是人类文明的共同愿望，是一个不可抗阻的趋向；它的首要目的，就是要增进相互的了解，消除隔阂和距离，从而加强各国人民之间的和平友好。例如，不久以前中国艺术团在欧洲许多国家访问演出，得到普遍的好评和赞誉。一位印度朋友曾经在巴黎写了一篇文章，说这是一次“艺术战胜了炸弹”的巨大胜利；美国的“星期日纽约时报”（1955年7月17日）上也披露了巴黎戏剧节中我国演出的京剧“三岔口”和一些其他国家的剧照，并且在它的通讯里说：“在舞台上出现了来自美国、共产党中国、芬兰、波兰和许多其他国家的演员。在那一晚的招待会上，法国、中国、东德和美国的演员们开怀对饮，谈笑风生，好像铁幕只是薄纱一般的东西了”。文化联系的再一个重要目的，就是要使各国人民的文化生活得到相互的丰富和繁荣。对我们说来，文化联系对于中国的社会主义建设是有重要意义的。毛主席在“新民主主义论”中，曾经谈到中国的文化要同一切别的民族的进步文化相联合，建立互相吸收和互相发展的关系。他指出：“中国应该大量吸收外国的进步文化，作为自己文化食粮的原料，这种工作过去还做得很不够。”他并说：“凡属我们今天用得着的东西，都应该吸收”。毛主席这几句话十分明确地指出了我们和各国人民进行文化联系的总的方针和目标；当我们今天处在汹涌澎湃的社会主义经济建设高潮和文化建设高潮、面对着迎头赶上世界先进科学文化水平这样一个艰巨任务的时候，这一指示就显得更加重要了。
    文化联系，有利于国际和平事业，也有利于我们祖国的社会主义建设事业，这是一件十分重要的事情，我们必须好好地用心思用力量去促进它，多方面地去发展它。
    二
    六年多以来，我国和八十六个国家有过各种友好性的文化艺术的交流活动。现在我们简要地分几个方面来谈一谈：
    首先，从中华人民共和国成立以来，到现在为止，我们一共派出了二十八起艺术团，共2，373人。他们在亚、欧、非三洲的二十七个国家（包括绝大部分已建交和一部分未建交的国家）进行了访问演出。在1955年一年内曾派出了九个艺术团，到过二十五个国家的176个城市，演出了685场，观众约达2，786，745人次。
    外国艺术团到中国来访问演出过的，有十七个国家的四十二起（其中苏联最多，有十起），共4，238人。仅1955年一年内来到中国的就有十六个国家的十九个艺术团，访问了二十七个城市，演出455场，观众1，500，364人次。
    最近一个时期内，我们还将陆续邀请一些外国的艺术团前来我国访问演出，其中将包括一些从未来过我国的国家的艺术团。目前一个必须尽可能好好解决的问题，就是要使我国更多地区更多的人民能够看到这些外国艺术团的精彩表演。
    其次，近年来蓬勃发展起来的另一种具有广泛群众性的文化联系，就是各种各样的体育竞赛活动。人民中国的游泳、乒乓球、篮球、排球、射击、摩托车等都已经在国际竞赛场上初露头角了。许多球队也来到过中国，其中包括著名的苏联、匈牙利、南斯拉夫的足球队，罗马尼亚的排球队，印度的乒乓球队、排球队，和缅甸的足球队等。
    截至目前为止，我国已参加了十二个国际体育组织。我们准备参加将于今年十一月在澳大利亚举行的第十六届国际奥林匹克运动会。
    第三，除了上述艺术表演和体育活动以外，我们还和许多国家在文化、艺术、教育、科学、医药、新闻方面互派专家学者相互进行友好访问和学习考察。我们并同一些国家相互派遣了留学生和教授。这种逐渐深入的专业性的交流，是近几年来文化联系的一个重要特征。在科学方面，除了苏联和人民民主国家以外，中国的科学家曾经去过日本、东南亚和西欧的一些国家。我们同苏联、日本曾经互派了较大型的科学代表团。六年来中国科学家出席了较主要的国际性科学会议八次，参加了天文、地质、建筑工程、以及世界科协等国际性科学组织。在新闻广播方面，六年来新闻工作者的往来逐渐频繁起来，他们的活动联系着广大的群众。
    第四，关于电影片的交流。六年来，我国以非营业性方式和营业性方式输出影片八十余部，共二千一百多个拷贝，到了将近六十个国家，包括十二个美洲国家在内。在国际评选场合得奖的我国故事片和纪录片有十五部。六年来我国翻译成华语对白的外国影片共四百四十部，其中包括印度十部，日本四部，意大利三部。我们曾举办过苏联和人民民主国家的电影周或电影展览，和印度电影周，今后还将陆续举办日本、法国等国的电影周。
    第五，翻译出版和书刊的交换。从1949年10月到1955年12月，我国翻译出版各国书籍共12，155种，188，538，000册。其中苏联的有10，017种；人民民主国家的有620种；其他国家1，518种，其中以美国的为最多，共有562种。同时，我国的各种古今名著也被许多国家陆续翻译出版。以日本为例，自1949年10月至1955年4月，中国著作被译成日文的，在文学方面有103种，发行五十三万册，社会科学方面的六十二种，发行了四十七万册。在书刊交换方面，六年来，我国北京图书馆同四十三个国家的138个单位建立了交换关系，经常向303个单位赠送出版物。中国科学院图书馆同四十一个国家的472个单位建立了书刊资料的交换关系，其中包括美国、德意志联邦共和国、比利时、菲律宾、南非联邦、葡萄牙等国。
    第六，举办展览会也是一种具有群众性的很好的文化联系方式。六年来我国分别向亚、非、欧、美、澳的约四十个国家送出了各种文化艺术及反映人民生活的展览将近290个；在我国举办了从十五个国家送来的文化艺术性的各种展览八十五个，观众约计930万人次。
    第七，其他各种文化资料乃至动物的交换。六年来，我国同许多国家在各种文化艺术的资料方面（如乐谱、唱片、绘画、工艺品以及文字资料等）进行了广泛的交流。中国科学院在1955年以前就已经同十五个国家的160多个团体（或个人）有了交换种子或种子目录的联系。1955年，科学院送出的科学论文约有602篇，标本约有2，147件。
    自从1952年以来，我国就同苏、捷、德、匈、波和日本等国建立了动物的交换关系。五年来由上述国家共送来动物269只，向他们送出动物1，674只。此外还同一些国家进行了相互的赠与。
    此外，归还和赠与历史文物，也是近年来我国对外文化联系中值得特别提出的事情。苏联先后于1951和1954两年送还“永乐大典”六十四本；德意志民主共和国格罗提渥总理于1955年访问中国时送还了“永乐大典”三本，义和团起义时的自由旗十面。这与某些国家过去掠夺了中国的古代文物、至今仍强占不还形成了很好的对照。同时，中国曾于1955年把大量的佛经赠送给印度学者维拉。今年中国佛教协会将一千四百多年前来华的柬埔寨高僧曼陀罗和僧伽婆罗译的九部佛经赠送给西哈努克亲王。
    三
    中国人民和他们各方面的代表人物，过去几年中在对外文化联系方面做了这样一些工作；他们在这方面有深刻的感受和丰富的收获。当然，在这些工作中也并不是没有缺点的。为了做好这一件十分重要的工作，我们把过去这方面实践中的若干活动进行了一番检查和总结，并由此归纳出以下几点来。
    第一，必须坚持相互尊重的原则。
    任何一个民族的文化艺术，包括音乐、舞蹈、美术等等，都反映了他们人民的历史和生活、创造和斗争。正因为如此，我们就应该在思想和感情上十分珍视其他国家的民族文化，犹如珍视我们自己的民族文化一样。对于我们还不熟悉、不很理解的东西，我们应该逐渐熟悉它，深入理解它，从而对它感到兴趣，直到真正欣赏它，吸收它。譬如印度的音乐舞蹈，对于我们大多数的外行人来说，最初是感到新奇的、生疏的；但是当我们一看再看，一听再听，同时加强了对这一个伟大国家伟大文化的认识以后，也就渐渐地从领会而发生浓厚的兴趣了。对于任何一个民族和一个国家的文化成果，我们都得很好地研究学习，而在更广泛的意义上说，对于其他国家的民族文化真正尊重的程度、鉴赏和认识的能力，也应该是这个国家的人民文化水平的标志之一。
    与此有关的一个问题，就是在各种文化联系的活动中，我们应该十分尊重和珍视国际友人对我们所提出的建议和批评。即使它们未必完全切合我们的实际，但是我们仍然应该热诚地表示欢迎，严肃地、认真地对待它们。既不能拒之于千里之外，也不应采取敷衍的、轻忽的态度。许多外国朋友在访问我国之后，都对我国生活的各方面提出了宝贵的意见和建议，有许多意见是非常中肯和有帮助的。
    第二，我们也必须尊重自己。
    尊重他人和尊重自己并不对立，而恰恰是相辅相成的。我们反对毫无根据地妄自尊大，同样也反对毫无根据地妄自菲薄；我们必须尊重和热爱祖国的文化传统，要创造发扬我们的民族文化，从而丰富世界人类的文化宝库。我们应该承认我国现在的文化是落后的，这是几千年封建统治和一百多年帝国主义压迫掠夺的结果。但是我们也完全应该看到多少年来我国劳动人民和艺术巨匠辛勤劳动的结晶，遗留给我们许多的好东西，散处在祖国辽阔的四方，有待搜集整理和加工提高；同时我们也完全有这个信心，在不太长的时间里，赶上世界科学文化的先进水平。
    我们也必须有充分的民族自信心，充分认识并重视我们民族文化的传统、特色和成就，进一步努力加工，继续向前发展。也只有具备这样的自信心，我们才会勇于介绍我们自己，把我们自己那怕是点滴的成就不吝惜地热诚地介绍给各国人民，来丰富人类共同的文化乐园。
    我们的越剧访问苏联和民主德国，受到了很大的欢迎，被称为中国的“民族歌剧”，并给予很高的评价。但在我们国内有些人却总是不愿意承认自己的戏曲是歌剧；而认为只有那种“始终歌唱”的西方歌剧才是所谓“正统的”歌剧。实际上这就是对自己丰富的民族戏曲采取鄙视的态度，表现了盲目崇拜西洋的思想残余。当日本歌舞伎在中国访问演出时，有人将中国戏曲和日本歌舞伎相比，说中国戏曲是歌剧型的，日本歌舞伎是音乐剧或乐舞剧。欧阳予倩院长说得好：中国戏就是中国戏，日本歌舞伎就是歌舞伎，这两种戏都是东方的、各有其特殊的演出形式和风格的戏剧艺术，不必以西方的歌剧形式为标准勉强分类。老舍先生在一年多以前“谈粗暴和保守”一文中也说：“外国朋友（对京剧）一提意见，我们就马上照办，不多去考虑一下，也未免粗暴。”这些话是应该引起注意的。
    当然，尊重自己绝不是故步自封、抱残守缺之谓。我们必须从我们自己的实际出发，努力吸收外国文化中一切于我有用的东西；但是这种吸收，必须经过一定的民族形式，和民族的特点相结合，才有用处。我们要好好地向人学习，但是不能乱学，现在学不了的也不要强学，不要随便改乱自己的东西。对于戏剧、对于音乐、歌唱、美术等等，这个道理都是适用的。毛主席早在1942年“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中就曾经说过：“继承和借鉴决不可以变成替代自己的创造，这是决不能替代的。文学艺术中对于古人和外国人的毫无批判的硬搬和模仿，乃是最没有出息的最害人的文学教条主义和艺术教条主义。”在解放后几年来对外文化联系的实践中，不少事例完全证明这一指示和精神的正确。
    第三，总括前面两条，我们就得出这样一条：在“文化联系”这个工作上，不管吸收进来也好，介绍出去也好，一定要采取热诚的、积极的、科学的、实事求是的态度。
    我们反对形式主义，反对只做表面工作，而应该通过文化交流使彼此都能实实在在地学到一些东西。在这方面，我们的工作是存在着很大缺点的。例如有一位外国朋友批评我们个别地区招待工作的作风是“宾馆主义”。他表示他所希望的是真正带一些知识回去，而不是带着一肚子黄酒回去。
    我们在文化友好活动中，要经得起赞扬，不要人家推崇一下，我们也就飘飘然忘其所以，而应该诚恳切实地对待批评，积极地加以研究、思考，分别采纳。我们对于人家，固然绝对不应该轻率地好为人师，但是也不要只是唯唯诺诺。“谦虚”是必要的，但也不必过分。譬如有一位外国漫画家，曾在我国举行了一个漫画展览。在一次专为这个展览举行的座谈会上，他诚恳地要求中国同志对他的创作提出意见，俾能有所改进。但他要求再三，座上却无一应者，大家都是满面笑容，连声说好。于是他当场又挥笔作画一幅——画的是他自己，身上背了一个沉重的包袱，上面写了个大字：“赞扬”。很多外国朋友都对我们有这样的批评，说中国人“太客气”了。这是值得我们注意改进的。
    第四，我们愿意在平等互利、互相尊重的基础上，同任何一个国家建立文化上的联系和合作。
    我国同苏联和人民民主国家的文化合作是增进我国同社会主义阵营各国的友好关系，推动我国社会主义建设前进的重要因素。因此，今后我们仍将不遗余力地加强我国同各兄弟国家之间的文化联系。此外，根据亚非会议最后公报的精神，我国同亚非各国之间的文化联系和合作将进一步发展。现在以夏万贝教授为首的埃及文化使团正在我国访问。不久我国将派出著名的京剧团去日本访问演出。我国同欧洲、美洲和澳洲各国的文化联系也要进一步开展。中国人民对外文化协会和其他有关团体已经或即将对法国、意大利等国的著名剧院发出邀请。澳大利亚和新西兰的文化教育界著名人士不久也将应邀前来访问中国。
    这里特别应该指出的是，几年来中国人民和美国人民之间的文化联系是最薄弱的。这种情况不但中国人民不能满意，可以想见在美国每一个公正的有识之士也是不会满意的。但是，造成这种情况的责任并不在我们。这只要举两件事情就足以说明了：1955年7月8日，在法国“巴黎文学社”社长索利亚和比利时“国际文化交换中心”经理儒斯曼两位先生的参与下，当时正在法国作访问演出的中国艺术团的团长张致祥和美国人人歌剧团团长布林在一份“联合声明”上签了字，其中规定：美国人人歌剧团被邀请于1955年11月去中华人民共和国演出美国歌剧“波吉与白丝”，中华人民共和国的一个艺术团被邀请在同一期间去美国演出京剧和歌舞。但是事隔不久，布林先生托人转告张致祥团长说：他十分遗憾，在目前要得到允许到中国去旅行演出是不可能的。另一件事是，1955年11月中国人民举行了美国民主诗人惠特曼名著“草叶集”出版一百周年的纪念大会，筹备委员会在事前两个月曾向六位美国著名的文化人士发出了邀请；结果一个都没有能来，其中好几位是由于美国国务院拒发护照而不能成行。著名作家华尔多·弗兰克先生是被邀请者之一，事后他很愤慨地写了一封长信给“纽约时报”（1955年9月11日），其中有这样一段：
    “正如我所提醒杜勒斯先生的：在欧洲直到十八世纪末，各国政府进行‘热战’时，各国的科学家、学者、艺术家却仍然继续着往来。……中国有着同样的文化交流的传统，但中国并不像美国，她似乎并未失去这个传统。在这件重要事情上，中国没有我们这种‘极权主义’。……要是国务院欢迎了北平的这个行动，那就是一个有远见和有眼光的表现。”
    美国当局和他们的喉舌一直在制造所谓“铁幕”的神话，但是事实证明，阻碍各国人民友好往来的铁幕不在别处，而是在美国。这难道还不明显吗？
    对于美国人民和他们各方面优秀的代表人物，中国人民是一向尊重和怀有友好感情的；我们十分愿意和他们建立起密切的友好的联系。过去几年中，中国人民虽然还始终没有做过美国人民的客人；但是中国人民却是好客的。我们准备还要继续邀请一些美国朋友来中国观光，让他们了解中国人民的和平生活与和平愿望。这里顺便寄语布林先生，中国人民还在盼望着看到“波吉与白丝”的演出。
    人民的愿望和过去的事实完全证明：社会制度和思想意识的不同，并不妨碍各国人民之间的友好往来和文化联系。我们有许多共同的东西，而且我们也完全不妨在具体的接触中进行友好的自由论争。譬如1954年我们就曾经邀请“逻辑实证派”的英国哲学家、伦敦大学的艾尔教授到北京大学做过学术讲演。艾尔教授说他也曾和我们的哲学家金岳霖教授有过一番争论，但是“我们尊敬、友爱”。这是对的，我们可以自由争辩到面红耳赤，但是绝不剑拔弩张；不但不伤和气，而且要成为朋友。这也正是文化联系的本色，是值得好好提倡的。
    四
    文化联系应该在各国人民之间广泛地促进，多方面地进行。1954年5月世界和平理事会柏林特别会议文化委员会的建议提得好：“进一步发展民族文化活动和扩大文化交流的任何倡议——不管这种倡议来自何方”。谈到倡议，谈到这方面的倡导精神，我们应该坦率承认，在某些具体工作上，我们还不如我们的一些印度朋友、埃及朋友；我们也还不如一些法国朋友和意大利朋友。在这个工作上，我们还应该更加积极主动，克服保守思想。应该吸收更多的各方面的人来参加对外文化联系的活动，国内的文化团体和部门应该同国外有关的文化团体和部门建立起更密切更直接的联系，我们各方面的专家、学者代表人物应该和外国的同行同事们进行更主动更密切的通讯往来，我们应该通过文化联系把国际朋友中的旧雨新知团结得更多更好，我们要向他们好好学习，也要热诚地介绍自己。
    让我们共同努力把对外文化联系进一步推动、进一步加强吧。这是有利于我们的社会主义建设事业的，也是有利于维护和巩固国际和平的。
