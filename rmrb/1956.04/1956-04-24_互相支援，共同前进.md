    Mutual Support, Common Progress
    Li Shiyin, Worker at the Nitration Workshop of the Nanjing Chemical Plant

    Editor's Note: According to our investigation and understanding, the Tianjin Chemical Plant has learned a lesson from failing to supply raw materials to fraternal factories according to plan and has taken measures to avoid such accidents from happening again. However, similar problems still exist between some other factories. We hope that factories in various regions will learn from this incident and earnestly do a good job in coordination and cooperation between factories.

    On January 13th, just as our factory was vigorously carrying out a socialist emulation drive, striving to complete the tasks of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, we suddenly heard the material supplier say, "There is no more raw material, chlorobenzene." We rushed to ask the workshop director, Qian Yougen, who said, "The reason is that the Tianjin Chemical Plant did not send the chlorobenzene according to the planned time." Under this situation, we hurriedly searched everywhere for the barrels and measuring tanks that had contained chlorobenzene, squeezing out every drop of chlorobenzene inside to maintain production. At the same time, we sent telegrams and letters to the Tianjin Chemical Plant one after another to inquire. After waiting for several days, the chlorobenzene still had not arrived, and as a result, we were forced to stop work for four days. Our factory also sent people to Shanghai to buy a batch of chlorobenzene. In order to strive to complete the January production task, the workers held several production meetings, exchanged advanced experiences, and adopted the "rapid crystallization" method to improve production efficiency. But after producing for a few days, on January 23rd, there was no more chlorobenzene again. The workers anxiously questioned the supply and marketing department, only to find out that the Tianjin Chemical Plant had delayed the delivery date of the raw materials for mid-January again. As a result, we were forced to stop work for the second time.

    The two stoppages totaled seven days, reducing the production of para-nitrobenzene by 19.6% of the January plan, and losing nearly 50,000 yuan of wealth. All the other workshops in the factory overfulfilled their plans, only we held them back. What's even more serious is that it dampened the production enthusiasm of our workers. The Tianjin Chemical Plant's mistake of lacking close collaboration and mutual support, and its failure to act according to the contract, caused great damage to the work. Although the Tianjin Chemical Plant has been criticized in a circular by the Chemical Industry Administration and fined, it is more important that we should accept the profound lessons that this incident has given us.

    Here, I would also like to offer some suggestions to the leading comrades of our factory. After the launch of the increase production and practice economy campaign last year, the stock of chlorobenzene reserves was somewhat depleted, but the leading comrades had a complacent and self-satisfied mentality and failed to replenish the reserves in a timely manner as required. This is also one of the reasons for this incident of waiting for materials due to stoppage. Therefore, I hope that the factory leaders will quickly reverse this situation.

    In the cause of socialist construction, all factories should support each other, closely cooperate, and jointly build a socialist society!

    互相支援，共同前进
    国营南京化工厂硝化车间工人  李时银
    编者按：据我们调查了解，天津化工厂已经接受了不按计划给兄弟工厂供应原料的教训，并且采取措施避免这类事故的发生。但是，类似这样的问题在其他一些工厂之间也还存在。希望各地工厂从这件事情吸取教训，认真做好各厂之间的配合协作工作。
    一月十三日，正当我们工厂在轰轰烈烈地开展社会主义竞赛，争取提前完成第一个五年计划期间的任务的时候，忽然听到材料员说：“原料氯化苯没有了。”我们急忙跑去问车间主任钱有根，他说：“原因是天津化工厂没有按计划时间把氯化苯送来。”在这种情况下，我们赶紧到处去找曾经装过氯化苯的桶子、量罐，把里面点滴的氯化苯控出来，维持生产。同时，接连给天津化工厂去电报、信件催问。等了好几天，氯化苯还没有来，结果被迫停了四天工。我们厂里也派人到上海买了一批氯化苯。工人们为了争取完成一月份生产任务，举行了几次生产会议，交流了先进经验，采取“快速结晶”方法提高生产效率。但是生产了几天，到一月二十三日，又没有氯化苯了。工人们都很焦急地去质问供销科，原来又是因为天津化工厂的中旬原料拖延了发货日期。结果我们又被迫第二次停工。
    两次先后停工七天，少生产的对硝基占一月份计划的19.6％，损失了将近五万元的财富。全厂其他车间都超额完成了计划，只有我们拖住了他们的后腿。更严重的是打击了我们工人的生产积极性。天津化工厂这种缺乏密切协作、相互支援精神的错误和不按合同办事的作风，对工作的损害是很大的。虽然天津化工厂已经受到化学工业管理局的通报批评，并且被罚了款，但是，更重要的是我们应当接受这件事情给予我们的深刻的教训。
    这里，我要同时向我们工厂的领导同志提一点意见。在去年开展增产节约运动以后，氯化苯的库存贮备量有些消耗，但是领导同志有麻痹自满思想，没有及时按照规定补足贮备量，这也是造成这次停工待料事故的原因之一。因此，我希望工厂领导方面迅速扭转这种情况。
    在社会主义建设事业中，各个工厂之间都应该互相支援，密切协作，共同建设社会主义社会！
