    Excellent Design Chief Engineer – Chen Dai
    Xiao Ming
    Chen Dai, the design chief engineer of the Non-ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, led a group of designers in designing a new factory that China had never designed before, and completed the task ahead of schedule. During the second expansion project of this factory, he again organized the design personnel to make a complete set of designs with a responsible attitude, reducing the actual investment of the factory by 34% compared to the preliminary design budget, reducing the product cost by 29% after the renovation, increasing labor productivity by more than four times, and increasing the actual recovery rate of finished products by 20%. Because of these factors, the funds saved by the factory each year after the renovation can reach more than 50% of the renovation investment, which means that all basic construction investments can be recovered in less than two years.

    Due to his outstanding achievements in design leadership, Chen Dai was elected as a delegate to the National Congress of Advanced Producers at the recently held Heavy Industry Advanced Producer Representative Conference and received the Ministry of Heavy Industry's award for major technical achievements in the past year.

    How were these achievements obtained? In Chen Dai's own words, it is to do work honestly, learn Soviet advanced experience honestly, and closely integrate with the production and construction site.

    As early as 1950, Chen Dai and a group of engineering design technicians were assigned to design this new type of factory. At that time, no one, including Chen Dai, had done this new industrial design. Soviet experts had not yet arrived at this time. In this case, they had to find some engineering design materials from European and American capitalist countries that they were familiar with as references for their design work.

    After the design project officially started in the second half of 1950, they first set up an experimental factory. Because the task was tight, they had to start from research and design to construction. When the design work was at its most intense, Comrade Peter Lauf, a Soviet expert, came to the site. Under the guidance and help of Soviet experts, the design work proceeded smoothly. By the winter of 1953, this factory, which did not exist in China in the past, was built. This was Chen Dai's first time working with Soviet experts and also the first time he came into contact with advanced Soviet technical experience.

    With the rapid development of national construction, the factory underwent a second expansion in 1954. In the design work for this expansion project, Chen Dai repeatedly thought about how to implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. At the beginning of the design, he organized all the design personnel to make a production plan and asked Soviet experts to help review it. At the same time, in the design process, he learned from the experiences and lessons of the first design project, and finally, with the help of Soviet experts, completed the expansion design relatively perfectly, raising the main technical and economic indicators to an advanced level, saving a large amount of funds for the country.

    However, Chen Dai, as the person in overall charge of the design of this factory, was not very conscious or active in his thinking when he first accepted advanced Soviet design experience, but rather had the attitude of having to learn and then see. The old ideas of worshipping European and American capitalist countries' science and technology that were still full in his mind deeply influenced him, making it difficult for him to recognize the superiority of advanced Soviet technology all at once. When he first came into contact with Soviet experts, he was only moved by the Soviet experts' selfless work enthusiasm. He saw that Soviet experts were as serious and responsible as they were for their own country's cause, researching problems with Chinese design personnel every day, and going deep into the construction site to understand the situation, and always trying to solve every difficult problem without fear of trouble, and even actively offered ideas when ordering equipment. This was clearly different from the work style of some American experts he had come into contact with in old China. Constant contact with Soviet experts in the work made him begin to realize the superiority of advanced Soviet design technology in the face of many facts. He admired the Soviet experts' rich experience. Many new technical knowledge and valuable design experience that he had never learned before, he has now learned under the guidance of Soviet experts. In the process of designing with Soviet experts, he particularly realized the Soviet experts' emphasis on economic accounting, labor conditions, and labor safety protection, and these ideas had a deep education on him. After Chen Dai realized the superiority of advanced Soviet technology, he immediately became an active leader in implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. He began to use his own experience to help other technical personnel, and often organized design personnel to carefully study the suggestions of Soviet experts and learn advanced Soviet technical experience. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, they worked and learned at the same time, progressed quickly, and each design person was improved and exercised.

    When Chen Dai first learned advanced Soviet experience, he had a mindset of completely relying on Soviet experts. No matter how big or small the problems that occurred in the work, he would go to the experts to solve them, which was actually to ask the experts to replace them in their work. This not only could not help them to better learn advanced Soviet experience, but also could not cultivate their ability to independently carry out design work. For example, in the design of a dust absorption system for a factory building, the equipment originally intended to be used was considered by Soviet experts to be inefficient, and they suggested testing another one. At that time, they simply "followed" the expert's suggestion without seriously studying it, and even tested it hastily without clarifying the problem, so that they almost gave up the test because the surface effect was not good, but fortunately the Soviet expert guided them in time again. This method of just "following" without truly learning is impossible to learn advanced experience. Sometimes they didn't even do a good job of investigation and research, so that the design was based on errors, and the Soviet experts followed them down a wrong path. Later, they changed this practice. They not only worked hard to learn the Soviet experts' complete experience, but also paid attention to learning the Soviet experts' ideas and work methods, and strived to lay the foundation for independent design and comprehensively improve the design level.

    In his design work, Chen Dai not only studied advanced Soviet experience, but also paid special attention to absorbing the experience of production or construction sites. In the second expansion project that he was in charge of, in order to improve technical and economic indicators, he and some technical personnel repeatedly studied the production process and adopted a series of new measures and technologies to reduce the loss of finished products. Through their efforts, the actual recovery rate of finished products was finally increased to 112% of the site. During this period, the workers on the site reformed a certain production process, so that the actual recovery rate of finished products was suddenly increased to the original 114%. Chen Dai immediately studied this achievement with the design personnel and adopted it, improving the original design and increasing the actual recovery rate of finished products to the original 120%. In this work, Chen Dai deeply realized that workers and technicians labor day and night, diligently and diligently on the site, and naturally can continuously create new things, and these creations cannot be explored in the design post.

    In leading the design of this new type of industry, Chen Dai learned advanced Soviet experience on the one hand and learned from on-site and practical experience on the other hand, so that advanced Soviet experience and our production or construction are better combined, and this combination is an important way to improve the design level.

    Filled with excitement, Chen Dai told me some of his thoughts after being selected as a national advanced producer representative. This forty-two-year-old chief engineer is full of the vigor and joy of young people. He said: "Since liberation, not only his own work enthusiasm is very high, but also many old technicians he has come into contact with are the same, everyone is full of confidence and strength in their work. At the same time, they feel the great responsibility of the work they are undertaking today. Now, the Party and the government are calling on us technical personnel to march towards science, which is an encouragement and a spur to us. Today, our design technology level is still far behind the international level. How to better improve our design technology level and cultivate a group of young design experts for the motherland is an important task in the future. I am determined to contribute everything I have to the great motherland and respond to the care and cultivation of the Party and the government for us!" (Attached picture)

    优秀的设计总工程师—陈岱
    肖明
    重工业部有色冶金设计院的设计总工程师陈岱，领导一批设计人员设计了一个我国过去没有设计过的新工厂，并且提前完成了任务。在这个工厂进行第二次扩建工程中，他又以积极负责的工作态度，组织设计人员作出整体的成套设计，使这个工厂的实际投资比初步设计概算降低34％，改建后的产品成本将降低29％，劳动生产率提高四倍以上，成品实收率提高20％。由于这些因素，这个工厂改建后每年节省的资金可达这次改建投资的50％以上，这就是说，不到两年就可以收回全部基本建设投资。
    由于在设计领导工作方面的优异成绩，陈岱在最近召开的重工业先进生产者代表会议上，被选为出席全国先进生产者代表大会的代表，并且获得重工业部一年来重大技术成就的奖励。
    这些成绩是怎样得来的呢？用陈岱自己的话来说，就是老老实实地做工作，老老实实地学习苏联先进经验，密切地和生产施工现场结合。
    远在1950年，陈岱和一批工程设计技术人员被指定来设计这个新型工厂。当时，连陈岱在内，没有一个人是做过这项新工业设计的。苏联专家这时还没有来。在这种情况下，他们只好找一些他们所熟悉的欧美资本主义国家的工程设计资料做参考，进行设计工作。
    1950年下半年，设计工程正式开始进行后，他们首先设立了一个实验工厂。由于任务紧，他们只好从研究、设计到施工一起动手。正在设计工作进行得最紧张的时候，苏联专家彼得劳夫同志到现场上来了。在苏联专家的指导和帮助下，设计工作顺利地开展了。到1953年冬天，这个中国过去没有的工厂建成了。这是陈岱第一次和苏联专家在一起工作，也是第一次接触苏联先进技术经验。
    随着国家建设的飞跃发展，1954年这个工厂又进行了第二次扩建。在这次扩建工程的设计工作中，陈岱反复地思考如何贯彻执行苏联专家的建议。当设计一开始，他就组织全体设计人员做出生产方案，请苏联专家帮助研究审核。同时在设计过程中，他吸取了第一次设计工程中的经验教训，最后在苏联专家的帮助下，终于比较完善地完成了这次的扩建设计，把主要技术经济指标提高到先进的水平，为国家节约了大批资金。
    但是，作为这个厂的设计总负责人的陈岱，在一开始接受苏联先进设计经验的时候，思想上并不是很自觉、很积极的，而是带着不得不学、学了再看的情绪的。那些仍旧充满在他脑子里的旧的崇拜欧美资本主义国家的科学技术思想，深深地影响着他，使他一下子很难认识苏联先进技术的优越性。当他最初和苏联专家接触的时候，只是为苏联专家的忘我的劳动热情所感动。他看到苏联专家像对待自己国家的事业那样认真负责，每天同中国设计人员在一起研究问题，并且深入工地上去了解情况，在每遇到一项疑难的问题的时候总是不怕麻烦地设法解决，甚至在订购设备上也都是积极出主意。这和他过去在旧中国接触过的一些美国专家的工作作风显然是不同的。由于同苏联专家在工作中的不断接触，使他在许多事实面前开始体会到苏联先进设计技术的优越性了。苏联专家经验的丰富使他钦佩。许多过去从没有学过的新的技术知识和设计方面的宝贵经验，现在在苏联专家的指导下，他都学会了。在同苏联专家一起进行设计的过程中，他特别体会到苏联专家对经济核算工作、劳动条件和劳动安全保护方面的重视，这些思想对他的教育很深。陈岱认识到苏联先进技术的优越性以后，立刻成为贯彻执行苏联专家建议的积极领导人。他开始用自己的体会来帮助其他技术人员，并且经常组织设计人员认真地研究苏联专家的建议，学习苏联先进技术经验。在苏联专家的指导下，他们一面工作一面学习，进步得很快，每个设计人员都得到了提高和锻炼。
    陈岱在最初学习苏联先进经验的时候，有一种完全依赖苏联专家的思想。不管工作中发生的大小问题，都去找专家解决，实际上就是要专家代替他们工作。这样不仅不能帮助他们更好地去学习苏联先进经验，也不能培养他们独立进行设计工作的能力。例如，在一个厂房吸收飞尘系统的设计中，原拟采用的设备，苏联专家认为效率不好，建议试验另外一种。当时他们对专家的建议只是“照办”，而不去认真钻研，甚至没弄清问题就草率地试验，以致因为表面效果不好，几乎放弃试验，幸而苏联专家又及时地指导了他们。这种只是“照办”而没有真学的方式，是不可能学会先进经验的。有时他们甚至连调查研究工作也没有做好，以致设计根据错误，使苏联专家也跟着他们走了弯路。后来，他们改变了这种做法，他们不但努力地学习苏联专家成套的经验，同时还注意学习苏联专家的思想和工作方法，力求为独立设计奠定基础和全面提高设计水平。
    在设计工作中陈岱不仅钻研苏联先进经验，他还特别注意吸取生产或施工现场的经验。在他总负责设计的第二次扩建工程中，为了提高技术经济指标，他和一些技术人员曾经反复的研究生产过程，采用一系列的新措施和新技术来减少成品的耗损。经过他们的努力，最后将成品的实收率提高为现场的112％。就在这个期间，现场上工人们又改革了某一个生产过程，使成品的实收率一下子又提高为原来的114％，陈岱立刻和设计人员们一起研究并且采用了这个成就，改进了原来的设计，使成品的实收率提高到原来的120％。在这个工作中，陈岱深深地体会到：在现场里工人和技术人员日日夜夜、辛辛勤勤地劳动，自然能不断地创造出新的东西，而这些创造都不是在设计岗位上所能摸索到的。
    陈岱在领导这个新型工业设计中，一方面学习苏联先进经验，一方面学习现场和实际经验，这样就使苏联先进经验和我们的生产或施工结合得更好，这个结合是提高设计水平的一个重要途径。
    满怀着兴奋的心情，陈岱向我讲述了他被选为全国先进生产者代表以后的一些感想。这位四十二岁的总工程师充满着青年人的朝气和喜悦。他说：“从解放以来，不仅他自己的工作热情很高，就是他所接触到的许多旧技术人员也是一样，每个人都在工作中充满了信心和力量。同时也格外感到今天担负的工作责任的重大。现在，党和政府号召我们技术人员要向科学大进军，这对我们是鼓舞，也是鞭策。今天我们的设计技术水平还和国际水平相差很远，如何更好地提高自己的设计技术水平，和为祖国培养一批青年的设计专家，这是今后很重要的一项任务。我决心把自己的一切贡献给伟大的祖国，回答党和政府对我们的关怀和培养！”（附图片）
