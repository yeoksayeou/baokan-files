New Technological Achievements

　　Four New Products Successfully Trial-Produced

　　The Shenyang Transformer Factory has successfully trial-produced four new products this year. Among them is a 15,000 kVA large water-cooled electric furnace transformer. It weighs 30 tons, has strong heat dissipation, and is small in size, suitable for supplying power to 40-ton electric furnaces for smelting high-quality steel. The newly produced products also include a 3,200 kVA rectifier transformer for smelting and electrolysis of non-ferrous metals, a Soviet-style switchboard with outdoor installations for supplying mines and basic construction, and a large power transformer. These new products have been tested and identified, and they fully meet the standards required by the state. (Zhang Quan)

　　New Geological Surveying Method

　　Dai Yizuo, a technician at the Huainan Mining Bureau, with the help of technician Li Yulin, recently created a new geological surveying method – the "Coordinate Axis Intercept Method for Determining Control Points" and the "Combined Terrain Surveying Method."

　　Using this method to measure terrain control points eliminates the need to measure distances with steel rulers as before, and several tasks can be carried out in parallel. At the end of March, using this method to survey terrain in the east wing of the Jiulonggang Mine, the work efficiency was more than doubled. Comparing the surveyed drawings with the original surveyed drawings proved them to be completely accurate. In the past, the surveying work had to be stopped when it was windy because the steel ruler would bend and become inaccurate, but now, using this new method, it is no longer restricted by this.

　　Automatic Timing and Charge Indicator for Long-Distance Calls

　　Hua Fuxiang, a worker in the repair shop of the Hunan Provincial Postal and Telecommunications管理局, created an automatic timing and charge indicator for making long-distance calls. This timing and charge indicator is now being promoted in telecommunications bureaus in Beijing, Tianjin, Changsha, and other places. When the user is talking, the timing and charge indicator automatically starts working, and every two minutes and fifty-four seconds, it emits a short signal to tell the user and the operator at the telecommunications bureau that they have talked once (three minutes is counted as one time). When the user finishes the call and hangs up the headset, it stops moving. The time indicated by the time indicator when it stops is the total time the user has been talking. Using an automatic timing and charge indicator can completely avoid many of the shortcomings of relying on listening and manually recording call times in the past. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　Raw Silk Finer Than Hair

　　Wuxi Municipal Local State-Owned Silk Reeling Factory has successfully trial-produced a new product – 9/11 denier raw silk. The inspection results show that the quality fully meets the international standards of A grade or above. This kind of raw silk is finer than a strand of hair, and it has been out of stock in the international market for more than twenty years. (Our correspondent in Nanjing)

    技术上的新成就
    试制成功四种新产品
    沈阳变压器厂今年已经试制成功四种新产品。其中有一万五千仟伏安的大型水冷式电炉变压器。它的总重量有三十吨，散热力很强，体积小，可供四十吨炼优质钢电炉的变电用。在新制成的产品中，还有用于有色金属的冶炼、电解的三千二百千伏安的整流变压器，有供应矿山和基本建设用的户外装置的苏式开关板和大型电力变压器。这些新产品经过试验鉴定，完全达到了国家要求的标准。　（张泉）
    新的地质测量方法
    淮南矿务局技师戴翊佐，最近在技术员李玉林的帮助下，创造了一种新的地质测量方法——“座标轴截距定控制点法”和“地形联合测绘法”。
    用这种方法测量地形控制点，可以不必再像以前那样用钢尺量距离，而且有几种工作能够平行作业。三月底在九龙岗矿东翼用这种方法测量地形，工作效率提高两倍多。测绘出的图纸同原有测绘图对照，证明完全准确。过去一遇刮风，因为钢尺被风吹弯不准确，测量工作就要停止，现在用这种新的方法测量，就可以不受这一限制了。

    长途电话自动计时报次器
    湖南省邮电管理局修机室的工人华福祥创造了一种打长途电话时候用的自动计时报次器。这种计时报次器现在正在北京、天津、长沙等地电信局推广。当用户通话的时候，计时报次器就自动开始工作，每隔二分五十四秒它就开始发出短促的讯号，告诉用户和电信局值机人员已经通了一次话（三分钟算一次）。当用户通完话挂耳机的时候，它就停止走动。它停止走动的时候，指示时间的针指示的时间，就是用户通话的总的时间。使用自动计时报次器，值机人员可以完全避免过去凭耳朵听和用手纪录通话时间容易造成的许多缺点。　（据新华社讯）
    比头发还细的生丝
    无锡市地方国营缫丝一厂试制成功一种新产品——9／11但尼尔生丝。检验结果，质量完全合乎A 级以上的国际标准。这种生丝的细度比头发丝还细，国际市场上已经缺货二十多年。（本报驻南京记者）
