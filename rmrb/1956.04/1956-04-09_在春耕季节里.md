During the Qingming Season, Planting is Busy

In the famous rice-producing area of the Yangtze River Delta, Qingming Festival was a day of fine and warm weather. Farmers in the Songjiang and Suzhou special districts began sowing seedlings in over 1.6 million mu of paddy fields converted to double-cropping rice. In the lower reaches of the Jiangsu Province granary area, spring ploughing of single-crop fields was in full swing. More than 2,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the Yangzhou special district had nearly 10,000 plows working the fields. On Qingming Festival itself, Baoying County plowed more than 9,000 mu of land and prepared 580 mu of seedling beds.

In the Chaoyang Agricultural Production Cooperative along the Longhai Railway, more than 1,000 female members were working in the wheat fields to control pests. In one day, they captured 75 jin of wireworms in 116 mu of wheat fields.

In the Sanyu cotton area of Nantong County, the three tractor teams of the Sanyu Tractor Station were plowing and harrowing the land for agricultural cooperatives. Cooperative members were also loosening the soil to retain moisture, opening drainage ditches, and preparing the land. (Our correspondent in Nanjing)

Planting Cotton North and South of the Tianshan Mountains

The intense moment of cotton planting has arrived north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Cotton fields in the Hotan, Aksu, and Korla special districts, and in Turpan County, are being sown. This year's cotton planting period is about ten days earlier than last year. Many agricultural production cooperatives are adopting the method of "alternating rest for people and animals, and non-stop operation of farm implements" to shorten the planting period.

This year, various localities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are expanding the cotton planting area. The Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region plans to plant 12,000 mu of long-staple cotton in the reclamation areas of Aksu, Turpan, etc., an increase of more than 10,000 mu compared with last year. The Turpan Long-Staple Cotton Planting Farm had already completed planting 1,000 mu by the end of March. The Aksu Reclamation Area Farm plans to complete planting 11,000 mu before April 9th.

Busy Spring Ploughing Activities Have Begun in Rural Areas Across the Country

Busy spring ploughing activities have begun in vast rural areas from south to north. In the southern provinces, early rice transplanting has begun, and in warmer regions, early rice sowing is almost complete. Northern provinces have also begun sowing cotton, spring wheat, spring corn, potatoes, and other crops one after another. Shandong, Shanxi, and the Anyang Cotton Farm in Henan Province, and the Xinxiang special district began sowing cotton around Qingming Festival, generally 10 to 20 days earlier than last year. The banks of the Liao River, the main wheat-producing area in Liaoning Province, also started sowing spring wheat three to five days earlier than last year. Early-maturing crops such as potatoes and spring peas have been sown in the Weishui Plateau and the northern foothills of the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province.

While spring sowing is underway, various localities are also actively strengthening field management of winter wheat and other crops. The growth of more than 30 million mu of winter-sown rapeseed across the country is normal. At present, rapeseed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces is in full bloom; early-maturing rapeseed in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces has begun to be harvested.

This year, agricultural production cooperatives in various localities have accumulated more manure than in any previous year. Jiangxi Province applied an average of 65 dan of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, more than double that of last year. Shanxi Province has accumulated nearly 1.7 billion jin of fertilizer, more than double the amount accumulated during the same period last year.

Spring Ploughing Scene in the Suburbs of the Capital

The day before Qingming Festival, just as dawn broke, members of agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing were heading to the fields in groups with hoes and livestock. Some were harrowing the land, some were spreading manure, some were opening paddy fields, and some were tidying up vegetable plots, presenting a busy and joyful spring ploughing scene everywhere.

Carts carrying manure to the fields came and went one after another. Land that had never been fertilized before was now filled with piles of manure, one after another. This year, the average amount of manure accumulated in the suburbs can reach more than 10,000 jin per mu, exceeding the amount of manure accumulated in previous years by four to five times. The spring fallow land prepared for sowing cotton, spring corn, and sorghum was plowed and harrowed smoothly. Sowing will begin successively after Qingming. The wheat fields were also filled with crisscrossing ditches, and the water conservancy construction army was working day and night. From January to the end of March, the suburbs completed and are currently drilling more than 3,200 wells, accounting for more than 64% of the annual well-drilling task. According to preliminary calculations, 600,000 mu of dry land in the suburbs will be transformed into irrigated land this year.

The spring vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, radishes, and fennel of the agricultural production cooperatives have been sown. The 3,100 mu of spring potatoes in the Huangtugang cooperative were basically sown on the 5th, completing the sowing task ten days earlier than in previous years. The well-known Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative in Haidian District now harvests two to three thousand jin of fresh cucumbers, green peppers, winter melons, and hyacinth beans from the greenhouse every day to supply the people of the capital. This year, the vegetable production in the suburbs of Beijing will reach more than 1.4 billion jin, an increase of more than 600 million jin compared with last year.

This year, the attendance rate of various cooperatives generally reached 90%, especially the female members, who are very enthusiastic. Women who did not participate in agricultural production in the past have now taken the initiative to demand more work. Female members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shijingshan District and some male members with weak labor recently built a canal more than five miles long, turning 3,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land.

Strive to Cultivate Strong Seedlings

The early rice sowing work for double-cropping rice in Hunan Province has been completed ten days earlier than in previous years.

Although it rained continuously in Hunan Province in late March and the temperature was very low, various localities adopted methods such as low-temperature germination, rapid germination, and building windbreaks and windproof sheds on the edge of seedling fields, so that a large number of seedling fields avoided seed rot. Now, farmers throughout the province are working hard to cultivate strong seedlings and prevent seedling rot. (Zhuo Kangning)

Sowing Ahead of Schedule in Harsh Weather

Anhui Province has fully started spring sowing. In the Wuhu and Anqing special districts along the Yangtze River, farmers overcame the difficulties of the harsh weather this year and used methods such as sowing dry seedlings to advance the sowing period of early rice by ten days to half a month. Around Qingming Festival, the work of sowing water seedlings has also begun. Now, the seedlings in some places are already more than an inch tall. Farmers in the Lu'an, Bengbu, and Fuyang special districts are sowing high-yield crops such as spring potatoes and corn; at the same time, they have cultivated a large number of Victory No. 100 sweet potato seedlings and selected fields for converting to rice cultivation in preparation for sowing.

Longjing Tea Begins to Be Picked

In the tea gardens around the Lion Peak Mountains by the West Lake, the tips of the dark green tea bushes have already sprouted tender buds with white fluff. The nationally famous Longjing "Mingqian" tea has begun to be picked.

At present, the tea gardens in the Lion Peak, Wuyun, and Meijiawu mountains are like being covered with lush spring costumes, which indicates that this year will be a bumper year for tea.

Workers from the Hangzhou Longjing Tea Farm and members of the tea production cooperative went to the mountains to pick Mingqian tea six days earlier than in previous years. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    在春耕季节里
    清明时节播种忙
    在著名的水稻区长江三角洲，清明节这一天是一个风和日暖的好天气，松江、苏州两专区农民在一百六十多万亩改种双季稻的秧田里，开始播种下秧。在江苏省粮仓里下河地区，一熟田的春耕全面展开。扬州专区二千多个农业生产合作社有近万张犁在耕田，宝应县清明节当天就耕了九千多亩土地，做秧池五百八十亩。
    在陇海铁路边上的朝阳农业生产合作社里，一千多个女社员，正在麦田里进行治虫工作。她们在116亩麦田里，一天就捕捉了金针虫七十五斤。
    在南通县三余棉区，三余拖拉机站的三个拖拉机队出动为农业合作社耕耙地，社员们也在松土保墒，开排水沟整地。　（本报驻南京记者）
  天山南北种棉花
    播种棉花的紧张时刻来到了天山南北。和阗、阿克苏、库尔勒专区和吐鲁番县的棉田正在播种。今年的棉花播种期较去年提前了十天左右。许多农业生产合作社采取“人畜轮流休息、农具不停”的办法来缩短播种期。
    今年新疆维吾尔自治区各地扩大棉花播种面积。新疆军区生产建设部队计划在阿克苏、吐鲁番等垦区播种长绒棉一万二千亩，播种面积比去年增加一万多亩。吐鲁番长绒棉植棉场已经在三月下旬播完了一千亩，阿克苏垦区农场计划在四月九日以前播完一万一千亩。（本报驻乌鲁木齐记者）
    各地农村开始了繁忙的春耕活动
    从南到北的广大农村开始了繁忙的春耕活动。南方各省的早稻已开始插秧，气候温暖的地区的早稻已快播种完毕。北方各省也陆续开始播种棉花、春小麦、春玉米、马铃薯等作物。山东、山西和河南省安阳棉场和新乡专区在清明节前后已开始播种棉花，一般比去年提早了十天到二十天。辽宁省主要产麦区的辽河两岸也比去年提前三天到五天播种春小麦。陕西省渭水高原和秦岭北麓山区的洋芋、春豌豆等早熟作物已播种完毕。
    在春播的同时，各地也积极加强了冬小麦等作物的田间管理。全国三千多万亩冬播油菜生长情况很正常。现在，江苏、浙江、安徽、湖南、江西等省的油菜已在盛花阶段；四川、云南、贵州等省的早熟油菜已经开始收获。
    今年各地的农业生产合作社积肥的数量比过去任何一年都多。江西省平均每亩耕地施肥六十五担，比去年增加一倍多。山西省已积肥近十七亿斤，比去年同时期积肥数量增加一倍以上。
    首都郊区的春耕景象
    清明节前一天，天刚亮，北京市郊区的农业生产合作社社员就成群结队扛着锄头、赶着牲口下地了。有的耙地，有的扬粪，有的开水田，有的整理菜地，到处呈现一片繁忙和欢欣的春耕景象。
    往地里送粪的大车一辆接一辆地来往奔驰，从来不施肥的地，现在摆满了一丘一丘的粪堆。全郊区今年的积肥量每亩平均可达到一万多斤，超过往年积肥数量四、五倍。准备播种棉花、春玉米、高粱的春白地，耕耙得又平又松，清明后就陆续开始播种。麦田里也布满了纵横交错的沟渠，兴修水利的大军正在不分昼夜地劳动着。从一月到三月底止，全郊区已完成和正在打的水井有三千二百多眼，占全年打井任务的64％以上。据初步计算，全郊区今年将有六十万亩旱地变为水地。
    农业生产合作社的小白菜、小萝卜、茴香等春季蔬菜已播种完毕，黄土岗社三千一百多亩春土豆在五日已基本播种完，比往年提前十天完成播种任务。人们熟知的海淀区四季青蔬菜生产合作社，现在每天都从温室里采摘两三千斤新鲜的黄瓜、青椒、东瓜、扁豆等蔬菜供应首都人民食用。今年北京市郊区的蔬菜产量要达到十四亿多斤，比去年增加了六亿多斤。
    今年各社的出勤率一般都达到90％，特别是女社员的劲头很大，过去不参加农业生产的妇女，今年都主动要求多做活。石景山区中苏友好农业生产合作社的女社员和一部分劳动弱的男社员，最近兴修了一条五里多长的水渠，把三千亩旱地变成了水地。
    努力培育壮秧
    湖南省双季稻的早稻播种工作，已经比往年提前十天完成。
    湖南省在三月下旬虽然久雨不晴，气温很低，但是各地采用了低温催芽、快速催芽和在秧田边筑防风堤、防风篷等办法，使大量秧田避免了烂种。现在全省农民正在紧张地培育壮秧和防止烂秧。　（卓康宁）
    在恶劣气候中提前播种
    安徽省全面开始春播工作。在沿长江的芜湖、安庆两专区，农民克服了今年气候恶劣的困难，用播旱秧等办法，使早稻的播种期提前了十天到半月。清明前后，播种水秧的工作也已开始。现在有些地方的秧苗已经有一寸多高。六安、蚌埠、阜阳三专区的农民正在播种高产作物春马铃薯和玉米；同时大量培育了胜利百号山芋苗，选好了改种水稻的田，准备播种。

    龙井茶开始采摘
    西子湖畔狮峰山岭一带的茶园，乌油油的茶丛尖头已吐露带有白毛的嫩尖。全国著名的龙井“明前”茶叶已开始采摘了。
    目前，狮峰、五云和梅家坞等山一带茶园，像披上了青葱郁茂的春日新装，预示着今年将是一个茶叶丰收的年头。
