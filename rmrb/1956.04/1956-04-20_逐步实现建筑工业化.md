Editorial: Gradually Realize Industrialization of Construction

    In the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, China's construction industry has made great progress: construction and installation organizations with a certain amount of mechanical equipment have been established, and a group of skilled workers, engineering and technical personnel, and management cadres to lead modern industrial construction have been trained. The construction industry has become an important sector in the national economy, shouldering the glorious task of China's socialist construction.
    However, the current state of China's construction industry is far from meeting the needs of China's socialist construction. Due to the accelerated socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, especially the early realization of agricultural cooperativization and the accelerated development of industry, China's basic construction tasks have become increasingly huge. The amount of work planned to be completed in the last two years of the First Five-Year Plan is greater than the total amount of work in the first three years, and the amount of work in the Second and Third Five-Year Plans will be much greater than that in the First Five-Year Plan, and the technical requirements will be higher and higher. However, China's construction industry is not only technically backward and has a poor foundation, but also has many shortcomings due to certain right-leaning conservative ideas and mismanagement in leadership, so that the existing strength has not been fully utilized. Obviously, if we do not strengthen the construction industry and strive to eliminate the shortcomings in the construction industry, it will be impossible to complete the task of China's socialist construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.
    The fundamental direction for strengthening and improving the construction industry is to gradually realize the industrialization of construction. The practice of construction in China in recent years has proved that the industrialization of construction can greatly shorten the construction period, improve quality, ensure safety, and reduce costs. In the project of the main factory building of the state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, due to the adoption of prefabricated structures and mechanical hoisting in the three reinforced concrete projects of columns, large beams, and eaves trough panels, not only the construction period was shortened, but also the honeycomb voids in the concrete project were basically eliminated, ensuring the quality of the project. The state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory used 137 cubic meters of wooden formwork, which saved 97% of wood compared with the integral structure of the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory of the same scale; each cubic meter of concrete was 7% lower than the national quota, and labor consumption was also reduced a lot. There are many similar examples in the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory, such as the motorcycle workshop with 184 ten-ton prefabricated reinforced concrete columns. It only took 28 people and four working days to install them mechanically, and the total project cost was 2,100 yuan; if manual and manual tools were used for installation, fifteen people could only install one column a day, which would take 2,760 working days, and the labor cost would be 7,200 yuan, which is 3.5 times more expensive than mechanical construction. For the living room of the foundry workshop, the amount of excavation was 78,000 cubic meters. If manual excavation was used, it would take 94 days, and the cost would be more than 177,000 yuan; with mechanical construction, it only took 47 days, and the cost was more than 182,000 yuan, but the construction period was shortened by 47 days. For example, the main factory building of Jilin Thermal Power Plant adopted prefabricated components for construction. It only took ten months from the start of civil construction to the installation of equipment, while the construction of another thermal power plant in Northeast China did not use this method and took thirteen months. These all show the superiority of the industrialization of construction.
    However, to promote the industrialization of construction in China, we must also consider the following two aspects: on the one hand, China has many large-scale and technically complex projects. If industrialized construction methods are not adopted, it will not be possible to ensure the progress of construction, ensure the quality of the project, ensure construction safety, and reduce costs. Therefore, such projects must actively adopt industrialized methods for construction. On the other hand, due to the backward production of construction machinery and liquid fuel, most of China's construction projects still use manual labor. There are also very few skilled workers, cadres, and experts in industrialized construction. Therefore, it is impossible to fully implement the industrialization of construction in the short term. The correct approach should be: First, key projects, that is, the construction of important industrial plants, mines, large bridges, dams, tunnel projects, and hydraulic structures, should actively implement industrialization. For such projects, attention should be paid to creating the necessary conditions, gradually improving the degree of factory construction, actively adopting factory-prefabricated assembled components and accessories, and correspondingly improving the level of mechanized construction. For those heavy labor that cannot be replaced by manpower, or projects with tight construction periods, narrow sites, and difficulty in supplying labor due to the sparse population in the construction area, mechanized construction should also be actively adopted. Second, for the construction of general small industrial plants, residential buildings, and other civil buildings, in a considerable period of time, we should make full use of China's abundant labor resources, strive to improve the skills of manual labor, actively adopt various advanced tools; at the same time, try to adopt factory-prefabricated lighter assembled structures and accessories, as well as manual tools and light machinery for construction, so as to actively create conditions for further improving the degree of factory mechanization construction. In this way, through the efforts of the construction industry department and other relevant departments, it is possible for China's key construction projects to basically complete the mechanization of heavy labor in five to seven years, and all construction projects in about twelve years.
    In order to realize the industrialization of construction, it is also necessary to strengthen the design work, and to formulate standard structural components and accessories catalogs as soon as possible, so as to widely adopt standard designs. It is necessary to expand the manufacturing industry of construction and road construction machinery, so as to plan to produce the machinery necessary to improve the level of factory mechanization. It is necessary to improve the management, scheduling, and maintenance of existing construction machinery, so as to improve the utilization rate of machinery. It is necessary to vigorously develop the building materials industry, so as to timely supply construction units with various building materials, structures, and accessories that are cheap and of good quality. It is necessary to improve the organizational form of construction and implement specialization, and to rapidly cultivate technical forces to meet the requirements put forward by large-scale basic construction tasks for construction and installation departments. It is necessary to strengthen scientific research work, so as to promote the industrialization of construction and accelerate the technical transformation of the construction industry.
    Gradually realize the industrialization of construction—actively and step by step implement factory mechanization construction, gradually change the construction methods of manual labor, and make China's construction industry catch up with the world's advanced level in a certain period of time—is the historical task of China's construction industry. Under the leadership of the Party and inspired by the upsurge of socialist revolution and construction, China's construction workers, engineering and technical personnel, management personnel, and other relevant personnel will surely be able to shoulder this glorious task.

    逐步实现建筑工业化
    在第一个五年计划的前三年中，我国的建筑工业获得了很大的发展：建立了拥有一定数量机械设备的建筑安装机构，培养了一批技术工人、工程技术人员和领导现代工业建设的管理干部。建筑工业已成为国民经济中的一个重要部门，负担着我国社会主义建设的光荣任务。
    但是，我国建筑工业的现状，还远远不能适应我国社会主义建设的需要。由于农业、手工业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造的加速进行，特别是农业合作化的提前实现和工业的加速发展，就使我国的基本建设任务日益巨大。第一个五年计划后两年中计划完成的工作量，要比前三年的工作总量大，第二、第三个五年计划的工作量，将更比第一个五年计划大得多，并且技术要求也愈来愈高。而我国的建筑工业不仅技术落后，基础太差，而且由于领导上存在某些右倾保守思想和管理不善，以致缺点很多，对于已有力量亦未充分利用。显然，如不加强建筑工业，努力消除建筑工业中的缺点，是不可能又多又快又好又省地完成我国社会主义建设的任务的。
    加强与改善建筑工业的根本方向，就是逐步实现建筑工业化。我国几年来建设的实践证明，建筑工业化可以大大地缩短工期、提高质量、保证安全和降低造价。国营北京第三棉纺织厂主厂房的工程，由于在柱、大梁、天沟板三项钢筋混凝土工程中，采用装配式结构和用机械吊装，不仅缩短了工期，而且基本上消灭了混凝土工程的蜂窝狗洞，保证了工程质量。国营北京第三棉纺织厂使用木模板137立方公尺，比同样规模的国营北京第二棉纺织厂整体式结构使用木模节约木材97％；每立方公尺混凝土比国家定额降低7％，在劳动消耗上，也减少很多。第一汽车制造厂的建筑施工中也有许多类似的例子，如摩托车间有184根十吨重的钢筋混凝土预制的柱子，采用机械安装只要二十八人、四个工作日就完成了，全部工程费为二千一百元；如果用人工和手动工具安装，十五个人一天只能装一根，则需二千七百六十个工作日，人工费要七千二百元，比机械施工贵三点五倍。铸工车间生活间，挖土工程量七万八千立方公尺，若采用人工挖土需要九十四天，所需费用为十七万七千多元；用机械施工，只用四十七天，所需费用虽为十八万二千多元，但把工期缩短了四十七天。又如吉林热电站主厂房采用了预制构件施工，由土建开工到设备安装，只用十个月时间，而东北的另一个热电站的工程未采用这种方法施工，就用了十三个月。这些，都表明了建筑工业化的优越性。
    但是，要在我国推行建筑工业化，还必须考虑到以下两个方面的事实：一方面，我国有许多规模巨大、技术复杂的工程，如不采用工业化的建筑方法，就不能保证建设进度，保证工程质量，保证施工安全和降低造价，因此，这类工程就必须积极采用工业化的方法进行建筑。另一方面，由于建筑机械与液体燃料的生产还很落后，我国的建设工程目前大部分还是使用手工劳动，进行工业化建筑的熟练工人、干部和专家也还很少，因此，也就不可能在短期内全部实行建筑工业化。正确的做法应当是：第一，重点工程，即重要的工业厂房、矿井、大的桥梁、水坝、隧道工程及水工建筑等方面的建筑施工，应积极地实行工业化。对于这类工程，要注意创造必要的条件，有步骤地提高工厂化施工的程度，积极采用工厂预制的装配式的构件和配件，并相应地提高机械化施工的水平。对于那些非人力所能代替的笨重劳动，或因工期紧迫、现场狭窄和建设地区人口稀少劳动力供应困难的工程，也应积极采用机械化施工。第二，一般小型的工业厂房、住宅和其他民用建筑的建筑施工，在相当时期内，则应充分利用我国丰富的劳动资源，努力提高手工劳动的技巧，积极采用各种先进工具；同时尽量采用工厂预制的较轻便的装配式结构和配件，以及手动工具、轻便机械进行建筑施工，从而为进一步提高工厂化机械化施工程度积极创造条件。这样，经过建筑工业部门和其他有关部门的努力，就有可能使我国的重点建设工程在五年到七年的时间内、全部建设工程在十二年左右的时间内，基本上完成笨重劳动的机械化。
    为了实现建筑工业化，还需要加强设计工作，尽速制定标准的结构构件和配件目录图册，以便广泛采用标准设计。需要扩大建筑和筑路机械制造业，以便有计划地生产为提高工厂化、机械化水平所必需的机械。需要改善现有建筑机械的管理调度和维修保养工作，以提高机械的利用率。需要大力发展建筑材料工业，以便及时供应施工单位以价廉物美的各种建筑材料、结构和配件。需要改善建筑施工的组织形式，实行专业化，迅速培养技术力量，以适应大规模的基本建设任务对建筑安装部门所提出的要求。需要加强科学研究工作，以促进建筑工业化和加速建筑工业的技术改造工作的进行。
    逐步实现建筑工业化——积极地有步骤地实行工厂化、机械化施工，逐步地改变手工劳动的施工方法，使我国的建筑工业在一定期间赶上世界先进水平，是我国建筑工业的历史任务。在党的领导下，在社会主义革命和建设高潮的鼓舞下，我国的建筑工人、工程技术人员、管理人员和其他有关人员，一定能够把这一光荣的任务担当起来。
