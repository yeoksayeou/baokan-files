Starting from August of last year, the Yumen Mining Bureau Transportation Department assigned the task of supporting petroleum exploration in the Qaidam Basin to its Third Transportation Brigade. It also drew some strength from other transportation teams to support them.

The Qaidam Basin is a newly developed construction base. This transportation team, like an iron torrent, gallops day and night on the desolate Gobi Desert, transporting various materials and equipment from Zhangye, the current terminal of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, through a distance of more than 1,200 kilometers to the basin.

At that time, this road was very difficult to travel, especially the section from Dunhuang to Mangya, which was more than 600 kilometers long. Because it had been in disrepair for many years, it was full of pits and bumps everywhere. Carelessly, the steel plates, I-beams, or rear axles of the cars were in danger of being broken. In order to ensure driving safety, the drivers used their own tools and hands to repair the road as they went. The Red Mud Flats, which they passed through along the way, had dust flying everywhere on sunny days, blocking their vision. The Suorkuli Ridge is a gravel mountain, the road winding and turning, the air on the mountain is thin. The Jinlong Mountain, more than 3,000 meters above sea level, has steep slopes and narrow roads, making driving even more difficult. Once, Communist Party member Ding Bangchao was driving a ten-ton truck loaded with machinery and parts when passing through here. Due to the sudden shift of the load, there was an imminent danger of the truck overturning. Ding Bangchao asked his assistant to get out of the car, and he calmly stepped on the brakes alone, slowly reversing, bravely and cleverly keeping the car as close to the cliff as possible, thus avoiding the accident. Another time, a transportation detachment was transporting equipment from Mangya to a construction site and had to cross a large mountain. The truck was too heavy to climb, so they unloaded half of the equipment and transported it to the top of the mountain in two trips.

In the early days of transportation, there were no residences or shops along the way, so the drivers cooked their own meals. The wind in the wild was too strong to start a fire, so they put up the tarpaulins to block the wind. At night, they camped in the Gobi Desert, surrounding the cars and covering them with tarpaulins. There was no place to repair and maintain the vehicles along the way. If the cars broke down, they had to repair them themselves, sometimes having to persevere in the wild for days and nights to repair the cars.

In the Qaidam Basin, the temperature drops to below minus 30 degrees Celsius in the coldest time, and the diesel fuel solidifies. At these times, the drivers always put the oil in the warmest place in the dormitory, even covering it with their own clothes. Even with these difficulties, they overfulfilled the transportation plan in 1955. There were twenty-nine drivers who drove safely for more than 100,000 kilometers throughout the year, and two who drove safely for 130,000 kilometers; there were eight who drove 100,000 kilometers without major repairs, and two who drove 110,000 kilometers without major repairs. While completing arduous transportation tasks, they did not forget to save every bit. In the second half of last year, the total value of savings reached more than 2 million yuan.

In a few months, these vanguards on the transportation front opened up roads for later people with their selfless labor. The current Qaidam transportation line is much better than before. The roads are being maintained better and better every day. Mangya has become the command post for the development of new oil fields. Derricks on the construction site are being built one after another. Tents and houses are also increasing day by day. There are also trading companies, and the food and accommodation for drivers and passengers are well arranged. This year, the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee also decided to plant a large number of vegetables at the Golmud State Farm in the basin so that people who go there to support construction can eat fresh vegetables.

    支援柴达木的汽车队
    邢柏如
    从去年八月份起，玉门矿务局运输处就把支援柴达木盆地石油勘探的运输任务交给所属第三运输大队。并且从其他几个运输队里抽调一部分力量来支援他们。
    柴达木盆地是新开辟的建设基地。这支运输队像一支铁流，日夜奔驰在荒凉的戈壁滩上，从目前兰新铁路通车的终点——张掖，把各种物资、器材通过一千二百多公里的路程，运送到盆地去。
    那时，这条路是很难走的，特别是从敦煌到茫崖六百多公里长的一段路，因为年久失修，到处都是一坑一包的，一不小心，汽车的钢板、工字梁或后轴就有被震断的危险。为了保证行车安全，司机们用自带的工具和双手随走随修道路。中途经过的红泥滩，天晴的时候飞扬的尘土挡住视线。梭尔库岭维山是砂石山，公路迂回蜿转，山上空气稀薄。拔海三千多公尺的金鸿山，坡陡路窄，行车更加艰难。有一次，共产党员丁邦朝驾驶一辆装满机件的十吨大卡车通过这里，由于载重力突然后移，顷刻间就有翻车的危险。丁邦朝让他的助手下车，一个人镇静地踏住刹车，慢慢后退，英勇机智地把车尽量靠在崖里，才避免了事故。还有一次，有一个运输分队由茫崖运器材到一个工地去，要翻一座大山。车太重爬不上去，大家就把车上的器材卸下一半，分两次运到山顶。
    在运输刚开始的时候，沿途没有住家，没有店铺，司机们就自己动手做饭。野地里风太大，生不着火，他们就把大伙的篷布撑起来挡风。夜里，他们就露宿在戈壁滩上，把汽车围起来，上面盖篷布。途中没有修理、保养车辆的地方，车子坏了只好自己修理，有时候要在野地里坚持几天几夜才把车子修好。
    柴达木盆地在最冷的时候，气温要降低到零下三十度以下，柴油都凝结了。在这些时候，司机们总是把油放在宿舍里最温暖的地方，甚至用自己的衣服来盖它。即使有这些困难，1955年他们也超额完成了运输计划。全年安全行驶十万公里以上的司机有二十九人，安全行驶十三万公里的有两个人；行驶十万公里无大修的有八个人，十一万公里无大修的有两个人。他们在完成艰巨的运输任务中，也没有忘掉一点一滴地节约，去年下半年节约总值达二百万多元。
    在几个月里，这些运输战线上的尖兵以自己的忘我劳动为后来的人们开辟了道路。现在的柴达木运输线比过去好得多了。公路护养得一天比一天好。茫崖已经成了开发新油田的指挥所。工地上的井架一个接着一个建立起来了。帐篷和房子也一天天增多。贸易公司也有了，司机和旅客们的食宿都有了妥善的安排。今年，青海省人民委员会还决定在盆地的格尔穆国营农场大量种植蔬菜，以便使到那里去支援建设的人们都能吃到新鲜的菜蔬。
