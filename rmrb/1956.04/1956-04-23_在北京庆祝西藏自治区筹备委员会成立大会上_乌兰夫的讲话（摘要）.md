The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established in Lhasa today. This is a great joyous event in the political life of the Tibetan people and a matter of great significance in our multi-ethnic family. The Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government attach great importance to this event and have specially sent a central delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi to Lhasa to offer congratulations. We can imagine that Lhasa must be a scene of jubilation everywhere today. We are celebrating here with the Tibetan people and feel extremely excited and happy.

The signing of the 1951 "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" brought epoch-making changes to the relationship between Tibet and the motherland and brought a bright and happy future to the Tibetan people. Over the past few years, the personnel sent to Tibet by the central government and the troops stationed in Tibet by the Chinese People's Liberation Army have faithfully implemented the agreement and made great achievements in safeguarding the borders of the motherland and in various construction undertakings for the Tibetan people. The opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways has strengthened the ties between Tibet and the interior of the motherland. In 1954, both the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni came to the central government and were elected as national leading staff members, participating in the management of national affairs. During their stay in Beijing, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni reached an agreement on historical and pending issues. This is another major advancement in internal unity in Tibet after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni restored friendly relations in 1952. All of this shows that the relationship between the central government and Tibet has become closer, the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and other nationalities has been further strengthened, and the patriotic spirit of the Tibetan people has risen even higher.

In March 1955, the seventh plenary meeting of the State Council approved the decision to establish a Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region composed of three parties: the Tibet Local Government, the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, and the People's Liberation Committee of the Qamdo Region. This decision was sincerely supported by people from all walks of life and all classes in Tibet. Now, under the personal leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, the preparatory work for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been completed.

The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is a major achievement in the cause of unity and progress in Tibet, a symbol of greater unity among all nationalities in the motherland, and another great victory for the Communist Party of China's policy on nationalities.

According to the decision of the State Council, the main task of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is to prepare for the implementation of regional autonomy in the Tibet region. National regional autonomy is the basic policy of the Communist Party of China for solving the issue of nationalities. It has been implemented among all nationalities in our country and has achieved great results, receiving the sincere support of the people of all nationalities. We believe that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, it will further strengthen the political enthusiasm and patriotism of the Tibetan people and establish the Tibet Autonomous Region at an early date. It will also enable the political, economic, and cultural undertakings in Tibet to be further developed.

The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is established on the basis of internal unity in Tibet. We believe that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, it will further unite people from all walks of life in Tibet, and, in the spirit of "mutual trust, mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual concession" as instructed by Chairman Mao, work together to establish the Tibet Autonomous Region and develop Tibet's economic and cultural undertakings.

The achievements made in Tibet's local work over the past few years are inseparable from the help of all nationalities in the country, especially the Han nationality. In the future, the progress of various tasks in Tibet still requires the united cooperation of personnel working in Tibet, troops stationed in Tibet, and people from all walks of life in Tibet. In the future, personnel working in Tibet and troops stationed in Tibet should continue to implement the policy on nationalities, the policy on religion, and the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, help Tibetan cadres do their work well, and wholeheartedly serve the Tibetan people; we believe that Tibetan cadres and the Tibetan people will also be more welcoming of the help from the Han and other nationalities. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, our multi-ethnic family will surely be more united, the people of all nationalities will surely live better, the internal unity of Tibet will surely be better, the Tibetan nationality will surely develop forward, and the Tibetan people will surely live a more fulfilling and happier life.

Let us, together with the people of all walks of life in Tibet, strengthen national unity, work together and advance together to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet, and to build a socialist motherland family!

    在北京庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上
    乌兰夫的讲话（摘要）
    西藏自治区筹备委员会今天在拉萨成立了，这是西藏人民政治生活中的一件大喜事，也是我国各民族大家庭中的一件具有重要意义的事情。中国共产党和中央人民政府十分重视这件事，特派以陈毅副总理为首的中央代表团前往拉萨祝贺，想像今天拉萨市一定是到处一片欢腾景象，我们在这里和西藏人民一起庆祝，也感到无比的兴奋和愉快。
    1951年“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”的签定，对西藏和祖国的关系带来了划时代的变化，给藏族人民带来了光明幸福的前途。几年来，中央派到西藏地方的工作人员和中国人民解放军驻藏部队忠实地执行了协议，为保卫祖国的边疆和为西藏人民的各项建设事业作出了很大成绩。康藏、青藏等公路的通车，密切了西藏地方和祖国内地的联系。1954年达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼同时来到中央，并且被选为国家的领导工作人员，参与了国家大事的管理。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在北京期间，双方就历史和悬案的问题达成协议。这是继1952年达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼恢复了友好关系以后西藏内部团结的又一重大进展。所有这些都说明中央和西藏地方的关系更加密切了，汉藏民族和其他各民族之间的团结进一步加强了，西藏人民的爱国主义精神更高涨了。
    1955年3月，国务院全体会议第七次会议通过了关于成立包括西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会和昌都地区人民解放委员会三方面统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定。这个决定得到了西藏各方面人士和各阶层人民衷心的拥护。现在，在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼亲自主持下，西藏自治区筹备委员会成立的准备工作已经完成了。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立是西藏地方团结、进步事业上的重大成就，是祖国各民族更加团结的一个标志，是中国共产党民族政策的又一伟大的胜利。
    根据国务院的决定，西藏自治区筹备委员会的主要任务是筹备在西藏地区实行区域自治。民族区域自治是中国共产党解决民族问题的基本政策，它已经在我国各民族中实现，并且获得了巨大的成效，得到各民族人民衷心的拥护。我们相信西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后，将更加加强西藏人民政治上的积极性和爱国主义热情，早日建立西藏自治区，也将使西藏地方的政治、经济、文化事业得到进一步的发展。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会是在西藏内部团结的基础上建立的，我们相信自治区筹备委员会成立后，将会更加团结西藏各方面人士，本着毛主席指示的“互相信任、互相尊重、互相谅解、互相让步”的精神，同心协力地为建立西藏自治区，发展西藏的经济、文化事业而奋斗。
    几年来，西藏地方工作获得的成绩是和国内各民族尤其是汉族人民的帮助分不开的，今后西藏地方各项工作的进步还是需要由进藏工作人员、驻藏部队和西藏各阶层人民团结合作。今后进藏工作人员和驻藏部队应继续贯彻执行民族政策、宗教政策和和平解放西藏办法的协议，帮助藏族干部作好工作，全心全意的为西藏人民服务；我们相信藏族干部和西藏人民也将会更加欢迎汉族和其他民族人民的帮助。在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，我国各民族大家庭一定会团结得更好，各民族人民一定会生活得更好，西藏内部也一定会团结得更好，藏族也一定会向前发展，西藏人民也一定会生活得更美满幸福。
    让我们和西藏各阶层人民一起，加强民族团结，为建设一个繁荣幸福的新西藏，为建设社会主义祖国大家庭共同努力，共同前进！
