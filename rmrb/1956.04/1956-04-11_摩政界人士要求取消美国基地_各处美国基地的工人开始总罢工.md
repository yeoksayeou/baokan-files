Xinhua News Agency, April 10th, Rabat dispatch: After France announced its recognition of Morocco's independence, the United States is still trying its best to maintain its military bases in Morocco. This attempt has been met with strong opposition from the Moroccan public. Recently, the Moroccan Communist Party and many prominent political leaders have resolutely demanded the cancellation of American bases.

Not long ago, Fassi, the chairman of the Independence Party, the largest party participating in the Moroccan government, announced that "Morocco did not participate in the negotiations held by France and the United States, which resulted in the signing of the agreement on the establishment of American bases on Moroccan territory, and therefore does not recognize this agreement."

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th, Rabat dispatch: On April 9th, approximately eight thousand workers at the six American military bases in Morocco and the headquarters of the U.S. 17th Air Force in Rabat began an indefinite general strike. The strike was initiated by the Moroccan Labor Union. According to United Press, this is the first time since its establishment a year ago that it has launched a general strike involving all American bases. The striking workers are protesting against the U.S. military authorities for dismissing workers for political reasons, and are demanding higher wages and improved working conditions.

    摩政界人士要求取消美国基地
    各处美国基地的工人开始总罢工
    新华社10日讯　拉巴特消息：在法国宣布承认摩洛哥独立以后，美国还在竭力企图继续保持它在摩洛哥的军事基地。这种企图遭到了摩洛哥公众的强烈反对。最近以来，摩洛哥共产党以及许多著名的政治领袖都坚决要求取消美国基地。
    不久以前，参加摩洛哥政府的最大的党独立党的主席法席宣布说，“摩洛哥过去没有参加法国和美国举行的、结果签订关于在摩洛哥领土上建立美国基地的协定的谈判，因而不承认这个协定。”
    新华社10日讯　拉巴特消息：四月九日，在摩洛哥的六个美国军事基地和拉巴特美国第十七航空队总部工作的约八千个工人开始无限期总罢工。这次罢工是摩洛哥劳工联盟发起的。合众社消息说，这是自从它在一年前成立以来第一次发起牵涉到所有美国基地的总罢工。罢工工人反对美军当局因政治原因解雇工人，并且要求提高工资和改善工人的境遇。
