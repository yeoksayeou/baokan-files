To the Editor:

The situation of blind land reclamation in Yuechi County, Sichuan Province, is very serious. For example, in Yanghe and Xikou townships of Huarong District, twenty-three agricultural cooperatives reclaimed land on 1,154 mu of forest, cutting down a total of 210,000 pine, birch, nanmu, and oak trees. The Qinghua Township Agricultural Cooperative, in order to reclaim land, even set fire to 450 mu of forest in the fifth village of Xikou Township. During the land reclamation process, Yu Chan Temple in Gaosheng Township completely destroyed 150 mu of newly planted Lespedeza seedlings from last autumn. The Fifth Agricultural Production Cooperative of Baitashan Township reclaimed most of the graveyard slopes used for grazing cattle and sheep, preparing to plant crops.

The reason why deforestation for farming occurs in these areas is mainly because the district and township leaders one-sidedly emphasize increasing grain production, failing to lead production based on the specific local conditions. Huarong Mountain, for example, is a very steep area with little land suitable for cultivating grain. However, Yao Guoqing, the secretary of the CCP Huarong District Committee, blindly stipulated that each agricultural cooperative must reclaim 20 mu of land. As a result, farmers in some cooperatives cut down and burned forests to reclaim wasteland. The result of doing so is that grain production has not increased much, but the country's forest resources have been severely damaged, which is truly a case of penny wise, pound foolish.

Although the CCP Yuechi County Committee said that it would stop this phenomenon after discovering it, it has not taken any effective measures. We believe that this practice must be corrected quickly to avoid continuing losses to the state and local farmers.

### 毁林开荒，得不偿失

    毁林开荒，得不偿失编辑同志：
    四川岳池县盲目开荒的情况很严重。例如华蓥区阳和、溪口两乡的二十三个农业社在1，154亩林地上开荒，共砍掉松树、桦木、楠木、青杠等二十一万株。庆华乡农业社为了开荒，竟在溪口乡五村放火烧毁森林四百五十亩。高升乡禹禅寺在开荒过程中把去年秋天造的一百五十亩马桑幼林全部毁掉了。白塔乡第五农业生产合作社把放牧牛羊的坟坪大部分都开了荒，准备栽种庄稼。
    这些地区所以会出现毁林开荒的现象，主要原因是区、乡领导人员片面强调增产粮食，不根据当地具体情况来领导生产。像华蓥山是个坡度很陡的地方，可以垦种粮食的土地不多，但是中共华蓥区委书记姚国清盲目规定每个农业社必须开荒二十亩。因此，有些社的农民就砍烧树林开垦荒地。这样做的结果，粮食增产不多，祖国的森林资源却受到了严重破坏，真是得不偿失。
    中共岳池县委发现这种现象以后虽然说要加以制止，但是并没有采取什么有效的措施。我们认为，这种做法必须很快纠正，以免使国家和当地农民继续遭到损失。
