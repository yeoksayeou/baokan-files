    Discussing the Performance of Kunqu Opera “Fifteen Strings of Cash” and “The Palace of Eternal Life”
    Ouyang Yuqian
    Recently, the Zhejiang Kunsu Opera Troupe came to Beijing to perform. I saw the two plays "Fifteen Strings of Cash" and "The Palace of Eternal Life." I really like "Fifteen Strings of Cash" and consider it one of the best plays I have ever seen.

    I don't have the original script of this play at hand, and I don't intend to do a comparative study here; I just want to talk about my impressions as an audience member: First of all, the script of this play is well adapted. Kunqu Opera scripts are generally lengthy and have many unnecessary scenes, so the story is not focused, the theme is not prominent, and the characters are not distinct. "Fifteen Strings of Cash," after being reorganized and adapted, changed a play of dozens of scenes into eight scenes, and a play that took a day and a night to perform was shortened to three hours. The high degree of concentration and generalization makes it look exceptionally compact. The development of the story is clear and logical, close to human sentiment and in line with logic—that is to say, the action is clearly connected, highlighting the theme (to redress the grievances of the wronged). What is even more valuable is that the main characters in the play are portrayed with distinct images, especially the characters of Guoyuzhi and Kuang Zhong, which are written best: Guoyuzhi is not corrupt, he is just subjective, one-sided, careless, and self-proclaimed to be wise and decisive. When the people are wronged, he thinks he has judged fairly, and laughs at those who seek truth from facts, ask carefully, and value human life as being pedantic. His superiors also regard him as a capable official. In the past, especially in feudal times, this kind of county magistrate was often regarded as a capable official by his superiors and protected, so he could do whatever he wanted. Therefore, there was a saying among the people that there were "county magistrates who exterminated families."

    Kuang Zhong is an upright and honest good official who "loves the people like his own children." This is a type of positive character in history. He is brave to do what is right and does not yield to power; he works hard and is not afraid of trouble; he does not ignore right and wrong because of personal interests; and he is also smart, capable, and meticulous. In the dark feudal era, there were also some honest officials like this. In the past, artists created the image of Bao Zheng on the stage. Kuang Zhong in "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is called the reincarnation of Bao Gong, but he is not deified like Bao Gong. He is just an ordinary person, which makes people feel reasonable, kind, and lovely. Other characters are also just right, and even a villain like Lou Ashu is not excessive. Some people have doubted whether Chinese opera has a tradition of realism, but this play alone is a strong affirmation.

    The script of this play is very concise. Its first draft, based on Zhu Suchen's original, narrates the encounters of the Xiong Youlan and Xiong Youhui brothers, two cases, and four male and female prisoners. There are a total of eleven scenes. The current stage performance deletes the plot of Xiong Youhui and Hou Sangu, leaving only the line of Xiong Youlan and Su Xujuan, eight clean scenes, without being redundant. I think it is exceptionally good. They have put a lot of effort into the adaptation. Such adaptation is equivalent to creation. This is a very important task in opera reform, which should not be underestimated, and non-professionals cannot do it. In the past, many of our famous zaju and legendary works could not be brought to today's stage as they were without adaptation, so they had to be allowed to be forgotten. The spirit of the Kunsu Opera Troupe in sorting out traditional repertoires is worth learning, and the method is also correct. After being adapted, "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is not only "strange then it is passed on, not strange then it is not passed on," but also particularly shows the people's character in the work and strengthens its educational significance.

    The script of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is good, and the performance is also good. The direction and performance have their own unique features. The scene where Lou Ashu kills You Hulu and mixes in with the crowd to frame others is handled concisely. The atmosphere of the trial scene is well created. Kuang Zhong's inner contradictions at the time are very obvious. From hearing the prisoners' cries of injustice to discovering the doubts and resolving to redress the grievances of Xiong and Su, he went through a very complex process of inner struggle. Everyone knows that his situation is difficult. Every psychological change of his is inextricably linked to two human lives. This is a difficult play to perform. Zhou Chuan Ying, who plays Kuang Zhong, performs well, but if the director does not prepare conditions for him, it will be difficult for him to perform.

    The scene where Kuang Zhong meets the governor (xunfu) seems a little exaggerated, but it is still appropriate. It is indeed difficult to see high officials. It is very powerful to set off Kuang Zhong's anxiety and his resolute and firm attitude. The scene where Kuang Zhong goes to You Hulu's house to investigate is most likely to become tedious and boring, but the director handles it lively and vividly, step by step grabbing the audience's attention. The psychology of everyone in the scene is revealed. Zhu Guoliang, who plays Guoyuzhi in this scene, performs very well. He is a stubborn county magistrate who does not buy the magistrate of Suzhou's account very much, and also opposes his overturning the case, deliberately ridiculing in his words while maintaining respect for his superiors. He grasps the measure very appropriately.

    The scene where Kuang Zhong disguises himself as a fortune teller and meets Lou Ashu in the temple is also wonderfully performed. The two people sit on a bench and perform a whole scene, one talking and one responding, which is very interesting. Wang Chuansong, who plays Lou Ashu, uses his very skilled technique to convey the twists and turns of the criminal's psychological state, which is really commendable.

    "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has no slack from beginning to end, and the audience concentrates on watching it without feeling tired. Some people say that this play can add more singing, I think this opinion can be considered; of course, it is also okay not to add it.

    "The Palace of Eternal Life" and "The Peach Blossom Fan" are outstanding masterpieces in Qing Dynasty legendary works. When Kunqu Opera was on the decline, this play played a certain role in reviving it. However, in addition to its beautiful and moving lyrics, this play is still the old set in terms of playwriting, and there is no new creation. Just such a play cannot save the decline of Kunqu Opera. Scenes such as "Xuge," "Small Banquet," "Sudden Change," and "Burying Jade" have been circulated for a relatively long time. Other scenes have rarely been performed in recent decades. Scenes such as "Love Token," "Bestowing the Box," "Magpie Bridge," and "Secret Oath" are all very simple and have no dramatic small segments, but there are so many and such long songs. It is okay to read them as lyric poems, but when they are performed on the stage as a play, you can only listen to the songs. If you are not a Kunqu Opera fan and cannot deeply understand the songs, you will not be interested. The Kunsu Opera Troupe put a lot of effort into sorting out this play, deleting some scenes and some songs, making the play more concentrated, which is completely right. Combining "Love Token" and "Bestowing the Box," adding group dances of palace maids and eunuchs, and strengthening the chorus (same scene music) makes it look magnificent. Such a lively scene covers up the monotonous content. The group dance scenes in this play, such as "Love Token," "Bestowing the Box," "Dance Plate," and Yang Guifei's exit with "Moth to the Flame" in "Small Banquet," and the formation changes of the guards at the end of "Burying Jade" are all well arranged. However, some scenes that have been preserved after deletion have not been well connected to become a complete play. The scene of stepping on a blind man to deliver lychees is incoherent, unharmonious, and very rigid, and it cannot explain the problem. "Burying Jade" is performed too long. As for the whole play, it is not known what it is trying to explain, and the connecting line is not clear enough. Therefore, when it comes to the scene of "Burying Jade," "The six armies do not advance for what can be done, the beautiful eyebrows die before the horse," it is difficult for the audience to understand what it is for. This play may need to be reorganized again.

    Kunqu Opera art is a large and valuable legacy of our traditional opera. Whether in terms of literature, music, dance, or performance, it preserves many good things. However, it is undeniable that it also has some fatal shortcomings that lead to its decline. If we want to preserve it, we must reform it and make it have new development. We must overcome its shortcomings and promote its advantages. I think: First, the script can be selected from famous works for adaptation, such as "Fifteen Strings of Cash," to make it suitable for today's stage performance. We can also more freely use new playwriting methods to write new scripts. In this way, the theme and ideology can be more suitable for new requirements, and the words and sentences can be more popular and easy to understand, so that the majority of the audience can easily accept it. The organization and sets of qupai can be changed to suit the needs. Secondly, the reform of music needs to be paid more attention to. The melody, rhythm, and singing method should be handled differently according to the plot, the character's personality, and emotions. Some people say that Kunqu Opera is "sleepy opera," which should be paid attention to. We want to make today's Kunqu Opera sing high into the clouds, becoming a melody that is refreshing and inspiring. When our traditional opera heritage is blooming in a hundred flowers today, Kunqu Opera can absorb rich nutrients from various brotherly opera genres and carry out appropriate reform work on its original basis. This is a work that is easy to say but very difficult to do. This is a work of injecting new blood, giving new life, and making it rejuvenate. The comrades of the Kunsu Opera Troupe have taken a correct step, made a good start, and achieved preliminary achievements. Other opera genres should also learn from them. The foundation of Kunqu Opera art is solid, and its development prospects are broad. The continuous efforts of the comrades of the Kunsu Opera Troupe will achieve greater success.

    谈昆剧“十五贯”和“长生殿”的演出
    欧阳予倩
    最近浙江昆苏剧团到北京演出，我看了“十五贯”和“长生殿”两个戏。我很喜欢“十五贯”，认为是我所看到的最好的戏之中的一个。
    我手边没有这个戏的原本，也没打算在这里作比较的研究；我只作为一个观众，谈一谈观后感：首先，这个戏的剧本改编得好。昆戏剧本一般都是冗长而其中有许多不必要的场子，因此故事不集中，主题不突出，人物形象不鲜明，“十五贯”经过整理改编，把几十场的一个戏改为八场，把一天一晚才演得完的戏改成三小时演完，高度的集中和概括，看起来异常紧凑。故事的发展条理明晰，线索清楚，近乎人情，合于逻辑——也就是说贯串动作明确，突出了主题（要为被冤屈的人伸冤）。更可贵的是对剧中的主要人物都塑造出了鲜明的形象，尤其是过于执、况钟这两个人物写得最好：过于执并不贪赃受贿，他就是主观片面，粗枝大叶而偏偏自命为英明果断。百姓受了冤屈他还以为断得公平，反笑实事求是、细心推问、重视人命的为迂腐，他的上级也就以他为能员。过去，尤其封建时代这种县官经常被上司看作能员加以庇护，可以为所欲为，所以在民间有“灭门的县官”的说法。
    况锺是个刚正廉明，“爱民如子”的好官。这在历史上是正面人物的一个类型。他见义勇为，不屈于权势；办起事来任劳任怨不怕麻烦；不以个人的利害而不问是非；而且精明强干，胆大心细；封建时代黑暗重重但也有一些类似这样的清官。过去的艺人在舞台上创造了包拯的形象，“十五贯”里的况锺被称为包公再世，但没有把他像包公那样加以神化，他不过一个普通人的形象，令人感觉入情入理，亲切可爱。其他人物也都恰如其分，就像娄阿鼠这样的反派人物也没有过火的地方。曾经有人怀疑中国戏曲有没有现实主义的传统，单就这个戏就是有力的肯定。
    这个戏的剧本写得很精练。它的初改本根据朱素臣的原本叙述熊友兰熊友蕙两弟兄的遭遇，两桩公案，男女四个犯人。共有十一场戏。现在台上演的把熊友蕙和侯三姑的一段情节删去，只留熊友兰与苏戌娟的一条线，干干净净八场戏，不蔓不支，我以为异常好。他们在改编方面下过很大的工夫，这样的改编等于创作，这在戏曲改革方面是很重要的一项工作，不容轻视，而且不是内行不能动手。过去我们许多杂剧传奇的名作不经过改编，就无法照原样搬上今天的舞台，就只好听其湮没。昆苏剧团整理传统剧目的精神值得学习，做法也是正确的。像“十五贯”经过改编，就不仅是“奇则传之，不奇则不传”，特别显示出作品中的人民性，加强了教育意义。
    “十五贯”剧本好，演出得也好。导演和表演都有独到之处。娄阿鼠杀了尤葫芦，杂在众人中诬陷别人的场面处理得简洁。判斩一场气氛造得好。况锺当时心上的矛盾十分明显，从他听见犯人呼冤到他发现疑窦，决心为熊苏二人昭雪是经过很复杂的内心斗争过程的，谁都知道他的处境艰难。他的每一个心理变化都间不容发地关系着两条人命。这是难演的戏。饰况锺的周传瑛演得好，但如果导演不为他准备条件，他也就很难施展。
    况锺见都堂（巡抚）一场的排场似乎夸张一点，但也还是适当的。大官难见，的确如此。衬托况锺心上的烦急和刚毅坚决的态度非常有力。况锺到尤葫芦家去查勘那样的场子最容易流于烦琐枯燥，导演却处理得活泼生动，一步一步把观众的注意抓住。在场每个人的心理都透露出来。这一场饰过于执的朱国梁演得很好。他是个强项的县官，对苏州知府不大买账，还反对他翻案，言语之中存心奚落而又必须保持对上司的礼貌，分寸之间掌握得十分适当。
    况锺化妆拆字先生在庙里会见娄阿鼠一场也演得很精彩。两个人坐在一条板凳上演整整一场戏，一搭一当煞是好看。饰娄阿鼠的王传淞运用他十分熟练的技术把犯罪的心理状态曲折回环地传达出来，真难能可贵。
    “十五贯”这个戏从头到尾毫无松懈之处，观众聚精会神地看下去不觉疲倦。有人说这个戏还可以多加一点唱工，我想这个意见可以考虑；当然不加也过得去。
    “长生殿”在清代传奇作品中和“桃花扇”都是杰出的名篇。当昆腔戏趋于衰败的时候，这个戏起了一定的回春作用。但是这个戏除了文词优美动人之外，在编剧方面仍然是老的一套，没有什么新的创造，单只这样一个戏也就无从挽救昆曲的颓唐。这个戏中如“絮阁”“小宴”“惊变”“埋玉”等出流传得比较久远。其他数十年来很少搬演。像“定情”“赐盒”“雀桥”“密誓”等，每出的情节都是异常简单、没有什么戏剧性的小小片段，而曲子是那样多、那样长，作为抒情诗读是可以的，作为戏在舞台上演就只好听听曲子。如果不是昆腔迷连曲子也不能深入领会那就不会感到兴趣。昆苏剧团整理这个戏费了不少力，删减些场子，删减些曲子，使戏更集中一些是完全对的。把“定情”“赐盒”合并，加上宫娥太监的群舞场面，加强合唱（同场曲）显得富丽堂皇，那样热闹的场面掩盖了单调的内容。这个戏的群舞场面如“定情”“赐盒”“舞盘”以及“小宴”中杨妃唱“扑灯蛾”的下场，埋玉结尾时卫士们的队形变化都排得很好。但是经过删节后所保存的一些场子，仍然没有很好地贯串起来成为一个完整的戏。进荔枝踏死盲人一场前后不衔接，不调和，生硬得很，也不能说明问题。“埋玉”演得太拖沓。就整个戏说，不知道要说明什么，贯串线不够明确，因此到了“埋玉”一场，“六军不发无奈何，宛转蛾眉马前死”，究竟是为了什么，却难于让观众理解。这个戏恐怕还要重新整理一番。
    昆曲艺术是我们的很大一批宝贵的戏曲遗产。无论从文学、音乐、舞蹈方面或表演方面说都保存着很多好东西。但是，无可讳言，它也有一些招致衰落的致命缺点。如果保存它，就必须加以改革，使它有新的发展。要克服它的缺点，发扬它的优点。我以为：第一，剧本可以选取原有名作改编，如“十五贯”那样，使它适合于今日的舞台演出。也可以更自由地运用新的编剧方法，编写新的剧本。这样主题思想可以更加适合新的要求，词句也可以更通俗易懂，使广大观众易于接受。曲牌的组织、套数为着适合需要都是可以变更的。其次，音乐的改革，更需要引起重视。曲调、节拍、唱法都要根据剧情、根据人物的性格和感情作不同的处理。有人说昆腔是“困腔”，这是应该注意的。我们要使今天的昆腔高唱入云，成为沁人心脾也足以振奋人心的曲调。当我们的戏曲遗产百花齐放的今天，昆剧可以从各兄弟剧种吸取丰富的养料，在它原有的基础上进行适当的改革工作。这是个说起来容易做起来十分艰巨的工作。这是注入新的血液、付与新的生命、使之返老还童的工作。昆苏剧团的同志们走了正确的一步，有了个很好的开始，也取得了初步的成就。对于其它剧种，也应当好好向他们学习。昆剧艺术的底子是雄厚的，它的发展前途是远大的。昆苏剧团同志们不断的努力将获得更大的成功。
