    Soviet Leaders Visit Britain
    Ai Na
    Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev arrived in London yesterday as guests of the government of the United Kingdom for a visit. Broad sections of the world attach great importance to this visit, considering it a major event of far-reaching international political significance. This is because, first, the experience of international reality proves that as long as the people's desire for peace is taken into account, personal contact between leaders of countries with different systems can produce positive results; second, major countries like the Soviet Union and Britain, which play an important role in international affairs, have had experience of cooperation in the past and now have common points of contact, and frank exchange of views between the two countries' leaders on issues of mutual interest to enhance mutual understanding will not only open up favorable prospects for Anglo-Soviet relations but also make an important contribution to further easing the international situation; third, the invitation to Bulganin and Khrushchev to visit Britain is in itself a development of the "Geneva spirit," and also a powerful answer to those who vainly attempt to bury the "Geneva spirit." As the "Indian Express" editorial rightly says: "Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain is by no means a usual thing, but something that no one dared to hope for before the Geneva Conference."
    With the growing strength of world peace forces, international tensions continue to ease. Although the arms race has not yet been stopped, and although some people are still actively engaged in piecing together military blocs and establishing military bases, and even the clamor of "atomic terror" or "brinkmanship" has not yet been completely silenced, no one can deny that the post-war international relations are undergoing a turning point of tremendous change. This change is significantly manifested in the increasingly deeply rooted demand for peaceful coexistence, which has become an increasingly irresistible force. Hundreds of millions of people in the two different systems of the world, regardless of their differences in nationality, color, religious belief and political views, almost unanimously hold a common belief: the scourge of war must be stopped, and can be stopped.
    Under this belief, the British public has increasingly strongly expressed its desire to improve relations and broadly cooperate with socialist countries. It is no accident that Comrade Malenkov's recent visit to Britain was met with a wide and warm welcome. The recent debate on foreign policy in the British House of Commons fully reflected the great anxiety and doubt of the British public about the British government's ten years of "Cold War" policy after the war. In the debate, many British politicians calmly assessed the reality, spoke of the pain experienced over the past decade, and severely criticized the attitude of the diehards in harming British interests. It is very clear that the heavy burden of arms expansion and war preparations is weighing on Britain, and restrictions on international trade are harming Britain, all of which are artificially created by the "Cold War." Painful experience has made more and more of the British public realize that for Britain, the only real way out is to accept "peaceful coexistence," abandon the harmful "Cold War," and develop friendly relations with socialist countries. British Member of Parliament Amery Hughes vividly pointed out that there are fifty million reasons why he believes Britain should establish close relations with the Soviet Union. This means that more than fifty million British people have a common desire to end the "Cold War."
    Anyone who is fair can see that the Soviet Union has always attached importance to establishing lasting friendly relations with Britain. The abnormality of Anglo-Soviet relations caused by the post-war "Cold War" is mainly not due to the Soviet Union's fault. From the first day of its birth, the Soviet Union has based its foreign policy on peace. The Soviet Union's loyalty to peace and willingness to be friendly with all countries is not based on any temporary tactical considerations, but is entirely determined by the essence of a socialist country. In the Soviet Union, there are no classes or groups who are keen on war and regard war as a means of making money; there are only working people who are heroically fighting for the cause of communist construction, who sincerely need an undisturbed environment for peaceful construction. The Soviet Union has always adhered to the principle that countries with two different systems can coexist peacefully. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was held not long ago, once again emphasized that this Leninist principle is the basis of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Comrade Khrushchev clearly pointed out in his report: "As in the past, we are willing to work to further improve our relations with Britain and France. We countries located in Europe have many common interests, first of all, we are all concerned about not allowing a new war to occur." Of course, the Soviet Union hopes to establish close ties with Britain, and this connection will not harm the interests of the United States, France, or any country in Europe and Asia, as Comrade Bulganin pointed out in answering questions from the British "Times": "When the Soviet Union hopes to establish good and friendly relations with any country, it does not require this country to reject friendship with any other country. ... The Soviet government hopes to establish friendly relations with Britain, as well as with France, the United States, and other countries."
    Of course, Britain and the Soviet Union have differences on some international issues. But these differences need not become an obstacle to improving Anglo-Soviet relations. Some of the differences between Britain and the Soviet Union are caused by the "Cold War." As long as the "Cold War" ends and an atmosphere of mutual trust is gradually established, they can be eliminated. Some issues are not impossible to resolve through consultation.
    In many ways, there is not only a basis for peaceful coexistence between Britain and the Soviet Union, but also a basis for friendly cooperation. First of all, there is no conflict of interest between the Soviet Union and Britain, such as the struggle for spheres of influence and markets that exists between imperialist countries, because the Soviet Union is not based on external expansion and harming others to benefit itself, and the founding principles of socialism require respect for the national interests of all countries and the development of the broadest international cooperation. As long as Britain also respects the interests of the Soviet Union, there is nothing to prevent mutually beneficial cooperation between them. Moreover, both Britain and the Soviet Union have the desire to prevent a nuclear war, maintain world peace, and reduce armaments. Britain and the Soviet Union fought side by side in two world wars. Especially in the Second World War, the threat of Nazism brought the people of the two countries together in wartime friendship in times of adversity. The people of the two countries are united in not allowing the scourge of German militarism to revive. The role of Anglo-Soviet rapprochement for world peace can also be proved by the international situation in recent years. The cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union was an indispensable factor in the Geneva Conference in July 1954 reaching an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina. People will not forget the role of the closeness of British and Soviet views in facilitating the conference when the major power conference, which had been interrupted for ten years, was finally held in Geneva in 1955.
    Secondly, there is great potential for the Soviet Union and Britain to develop trade on an equal basis, and this trade is beneficial to both countries, especially to Britain, which has serious market problems. This year marks the thirty-fifth anniversary of the restoration of normal Anglo-Soviet trade relations. For many years, Anglo-Soviet trade has been one of the main factors of cooperation between the two peoples. After the Second World War, Anglo-Soviet trade was greatly reduced due to the "embargo" imposed by Western countries on the East. The consequences are obvious, and Britain, which relies on exports, has suffered serious damage. Recently, it is completely understandable that more and more business people in Britain have strongly demanded the elimination of artificial restrictions imposed on them on trade with the Soviet Union and the East.
    Thirdly, there have always been various connections between the Soviet Union and Britain in culture and other fields. In recent years, the increasingly frequent exchanges of delegations between the two countries in the fields of politics, culture, art, science, technology, trade unions, and commerce have played a not small role in enhancing mutual understanding between the two countries. The Soviet people love Shakespeare and Dickens' country, just as the British people love Tolstoy and Gorky's motherland. The profound mutual attraction of these two great nations in spiritual culture can never be stopped by any artificial barriers.
    As early as 1935, the current British Prime Minister, then Lord Privy Seal Eden, went to Moscow to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. The communique issued afterwards stated: "There is now no conflict of interest between the two governments on any major issues of international policy," and "this fact provides a solid basis for the development of their effective cooperation for peace." This declaration twenty years ago is still fully applicable today. Prime Minister Eden recently reiterated that the British government attaches great importance to "discussing the many issues that currently divide the world" during Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit, and expressed its intention to "explore common ground." It is very clear that as long as both sides have sincerity and take into account the mutual interests of peace and security, it is not difficult to find "common ground."
    It must be pointed out that there are still considerable difficulties on the road to improving Anglo-Soviet relations. Certain powerful people in the United States, fearing the continued easing of the international situation, are conducting slanders and smears, attempting to obstruct the rapprochement and improvement of Anglo-Soviet relations. Some people in powerful groups in Britain are still obsessed with following the bankrupt "Cold War." This requires joint efforts from Britain and the Soviet Union, and especially relies on the British public to eliminate obstacles at home and abroad and urge the British government to take a realistic and positive attitude.

    苏联领袖访问英国
    艾纳
    苏联领袖布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志昨天到达伦敦，作为联合王国女王政府的贵宾，进行访问。全世界广泛人士都非常重视这次访问，认为是具有深远的国际政治意义的大事。因为第一，国际现实的经验证明：只要考虑到人民的和平愿望，不同制度的国家领导人之间的个人接触，是能够产生积极的结果的；第二，像苏联和英国这样在国际事务中起着重要作用的大国，过去有合作的经验，现在有共同的接触点，两国领导人就双方感到兴趣的问题坦率地交换意见，增进相互的了解，不但将为英苏关系开辟有利的前景，而且对于进一步缓和国际局势也可以作出重要贡献；第三，布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫应邀访问英国这件事情本身，就是“日内瓦精神”的一个发展，同时也是对那些妄图埋葬“日内瓦精神”的人们的有力答复。“印度快报”的社论说得很对：“布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫赴英访问绝不是一件通常的事情，而是在日内瓦会议以前没有人敢于希望发生的一件事。”
    在世界和平力量日益壮大的情况下，国际紧张局势继续趋向缓和。尽管军备竞赛还没有制止，尽管有人还在积极从事拼凑军事集团和建立军事基地的活动，甚至是“原子恐怖”或“战争边缘”的叫嚣也还没有完全戢敛，但是谁也无法拒绝承认，战后的国际关系在目前正发生着转折性的巨大变化。这种变化显著地表现在日益深入人心的和平共处的要求，已越来越成为不可抗拒的力量。在两个不同制度世界中的亿万人民，不论他们的民族、肤色、宗教信仰和政治见解是怎样的不同，但他们却几乎一致地抱着共同的信念：战争的祸害必须制止，也是能够制止的。
    在这一信念下，英国公众日益强烈地表现了要求同社会主义国家改善关系和广泛合作的愿望。最近马林科夫同志访问英国，受到广泛、热烈的欢迎，不是偶然的。不久以前在英国下院进行的外交政策的辩论，充分反映了英国广大公众对于英国战后十年推行“冷战”政策的无穷忧虑和怀疑。在辩论中，许多英国政界人士冷静地估计了现实，说出了十年来经历的痛苦，严厉地抨击了顽固派损害英国利益的态度。事实很清楚，扩军备战的重担压着英国，对国际贸易的限制损害着英国，而这些都是“冷战”人为地造成的。痛苦的经验使越来越多的英国公众认识到，对英国来说，只有接受“和平共处”，抛开有害的“冷战”，发展同社会主义国家的友好关系，才是真正的出路。英国国会议员艾姆利斯·赫尤兹生动地指出，有五千万个理由使他相信英国应该同苏联建立亲密的关系。意思就是说，五千余万英国人民有着要求结束“冷战”的共同愿望。
    任何公正的人都可以看到，苏联一向重视同英国建立持久的友好关系。战后“冷战”所造成的英苏关系的不正常，主要不是由于苏联的过失。苏联从它诞生的第一天起就以和平为它对外政策的基础。苏联的忠于和平、愿意同各国友好，不是基于什么暂时的策略考虑，而完全决定于社会主义国家的本质。在苏联，没有热衷于战争、把战争当做发财手段的阶级和集团，有的只是豪迈地为共产主义建设事业而奋斗的劳动人民，他们真诚地需要不受干扰的和平建设的环境。苏联一贯坚持两个不同制度的国家可以和平共处的原则。不久以前举行的苏共第二十次代表大会，又一次强调这个列宁主义原则是苏联对外政策的基础。赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告中明确地指出：“像以往一样，我们愿意努力进一步改进我们同英国和法国的关系。我们这些位于欧洲的国家是有许多共同的利益的，首先就是我们都关心不允许发生新战争。”当然，苏联希望同英国建立密切的联系，这种联系也不会有损于美、法或欧、亚任何国家的利益，正如布尔加宁同志答英国“泰晤士报”问中所指出：“当苏联希望同任何一个国家建立良好的、友好关系的时候，它并不需要这一个国家拒绝同任何其他国家的友谊。……苏联政府希望同英国、也希望同法国、美国和其他国家建立友好的关系。”
    固然，英国和苏联在有些国际问题上存在着分歧。但这些分歧可以不成为改善英苏关系的障碍。英苏之间的有些分歧是“冷战”造成的，只要结束“冷战”，逐渐建立互相信任的气氛，是可以消除的。有些问题也不是不可能通过协商来解决的。
    从许多方面来看，英苏之间不但有和平共处的基础，而且有友好合作的基础。首先，苏联和英国之间不存在像帝国主义国家之间那种争夺势力范围和市场的利害冲突，因为苏联不是以向外扩张和损人利己作为它发展的基础，而且社会主义的立国原则要求尊重一切国家的民族利益和发展最广泛的国际合作。只要英国也尊重苏联的利益，就没有什么东西妨碍它们之间的互利的合作。而且英苏两国都有防止一次核子战争、维持世界和平和裁减军备的愿望。英苏两国曾在两次世界大战中并肩作战。特别在第二次大战中，纳粹的威胁使两国人民结成患难与共的战时友谊。两国人民不许重受德国军国主义复活的祸害是一致的。英苏接近对于世界和平的作用也可以从近几年的国际形势中得到证明。1954年7月日内瓦会议所以能就恢复印度支那和平达成协议，英苏的合作是个不可缺少的因素。中断了十年的大国会议终于在1955年在日内瓦召开，人们也不会忘记英苏两国意见的接近对于促成会议的作用。
    其次，苏联同英国在平等基础上发展贸易有很大的可能性，而这种贸易对两国都有好处，特别是对有着严重市场问题的英国好处极大。今年是恢复英苏贸易正常关系的三十五周年。许多年来，英苏贸易一直是两国人民合作的主要因素之一。第二次世界大战以后，由于西方国家对东方的“禁运”，英苏贸易才大为减少。后果是显而易见的，倚靠输出的英国蒙受了严重的损害。最近，英国越来越多的工商界人士都强烈地要求消除强加在他们头上的对苏联和东方贸易的人为限制，是完全可以理解的。
    第三，苏联和英国之间在文化和其他方面也是历来就有着多种多样的联系的。近年以来，两国在政治、文化、艺术、科学、技术、工会和商业各方面代表团来往的日益频繁，对于增进两国相互了解已经起了不小的作用。苏联人民喜爱莎士比亚和狄更司的国家，犹如英国人民喜爱托尔斯泰和高尔基的祖国一样。这两大民族在精神文化上的深刻的相互吸引力，是决非任何人为的障碍所能阻遏的。
    早在1935年，现在的英国首相、当时的掌玺大臣艾登曾到莫斯科商谈建立欧洲集体安全制度的问题，事后发表的公报有这么一段话：“对于国际政策中任何主要的问题，两国政府现在并无利益的冲突，”而“这个事实对于发展他们为了和平的有效合作，提供了坚固的基础。”二十年前的这个宣告，依然完全适用于今天。艾登首相最近重申英国政府十分重视在布尔加宁赫鲁晓夫访问时期内“讨论目前使世界分歧的许多问题”，并表示要“探讨共同的基础”。很清楚，只要双方都具有诚意，考虑到和平和安全的互相利益，是不难找到“共同的基础”的。
    不能不指出，在改善英苏关系的道路上还存在着不小的困难。美国的某些当权人士害怕国际局势的续趋缓和，正在进行中伤和诬蔑，企图阻挠英苏关系的接近和改善。英国有势力集团中某些人士也仍在醉心于追随破产了的“冷战”。这就需要英苏两国共同努力，特别有赖于英国公众排除国内外的障碍，促使英国政府采取现实和积极的态度。
