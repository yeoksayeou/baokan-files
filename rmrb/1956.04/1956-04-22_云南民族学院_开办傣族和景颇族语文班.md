    Yunnan Nationalities Institute
    Opens Dai and Jingpo Language Classes

    The Yunnan Nationalities Institute has opened three language classes: Dai Le (the Dai language commonly used in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture), Dai Ne (the Dai language commonly used in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture), and Jingpo. The three classes have a total of more than 60 students from the Dai and Jingpo ethnic groups. The study period for all three classes is one and a half years. The main content of the study is their own ethnic language, and they also study the Han language. After graduation, these students will have a certain level of proficiency in their own ethnic language and general scientific knowledge of language. (Yunnan Daily Editorial Department)
