    Utilizing Favorable Conditions to Shorten Construction Preparation Time
    Lu Ping, Deputy Director of the Guanting Hydroelectric Power Engineering Office

    The Modekou Hydroelectric Power Station project on Beijing's Yongding River Water Diversion Project fully utilized objective favorable conditions and started construction with only five days of preparation time.

    The Guanting Hydroelectric Power Engineering Office of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry received the task of building the Modekou Hydropower Station project on January 5th. Higher-level leading organizations wanted us to complete the excavation of 120,000 cubic meters of earth and stone before the end of March. The time was so tight, and it was also the dead of winter. There wasn't a single construction room, and construction equipment, instruments, and materials couldn't be transferred in a timely manner (according to regulations, railway transportation plans must be submitted at least twenty days in advance). There were no technical designs, land requisition procedures for construction use had not been completed, and the water and electricity systems had not been arranged... In short, preparations in all aspects were lacking. What to do?

    Under these circumstances, we determined that to complete the state plan, we must strive for the construction period and squeeze out construction preparation time. Through multi-faceted efforts, especially with the strong support of the Yongding River Water Diversion Project Headquarters, local Party committees, governments, and fraternal units, we quickly solved many problems. For example, the Water Diversion Project Headquarters helped solve equipment problems and assisted in handling land requisition procedures. The Beijing Electric Power Administration supplied power and rented out transformers. The Railway Ministry Sanatorium lent a pumping station. The design department rushed to produce sketches for earth and stone excavation. The Beijing Railway Bureau took special circumstances into account and quickly allocated railway cars to transport equipment and materials. Thanks to this valuable assistance, we completed a lot of construction preparation work in a very short period of time.

    However, there was still a crucial problem: the housing and meals for more than 2,000 workers and staff had not been resolved. The weather was so cold that we could neither sleep in the open nor go hungry. Building houses would take too much time. The only solution was to utilize existing houses near the construction site, but it was not easy to find housing that could accommodate so many people. We first built some temporary houses as warehouses to store the equipment and materials that had been transported, and at the same time sent people out to contact and borrow houses. As a result, the Shijingshan Brick and Tile Factory helped by temporarily lending us the workshop and two new-style large brick kilns (equipped with electric lights) during the factory's winter shutdown. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army also vacated some houses for us to use as construction site offices. The Brick and Tile Factory also lent us the cooking room and a complete set of cooking utensils. In this way, we started construction preparation work on January 11th (before January 10th, we were mainly in contact with the design unit and surveying the construction site), basically completed construction preparation in five days, and started construction on January 16th.

    After construction started, we learned that the Brick and Tile Factory needed good clay for firing bricks, so we sent them good clay whenever we dug it up, and transported it by truck to the designated storage site of the Brick and Tile Factory. The soil excavated from the construction site was originally to be transported away, but giving it to the Brick and Tile Factory would not affect the project cost and would save the Brick and Tile Factory the cost of buying and transporting soil. It is estimated that by March 20th, the construction site had transported more than 7,000 cubic meters of soil to the Brick and Tile Factory, which could save the Brick and Tile Factory 20,000 yuan in investment. We lived in the Brick and Tile Factory's houses and were able to start construction early. After the temporary houses were built, we returned them to the factory before it started production, without delaying brick production.

    Through this specific fact, we fully realized that basic construction units not only have a lot of potential to tap, but also have many favorable conditions to utilize. With our own efforts and with the assistance of various parties, shortening preparation time and downtime, and fully utilizing construction time is completely possible.

### 利用有利条件缩短施工准备时间

    利用有利条件缩短施工准备时间
    官厅水力发电工程处副处长　鲁平
    北京市永定河引水工程上的模式口水力发电站工程，充分利用了客观有利条件，只用了五天的施工准备时间就开工了。
    电力工业部官厅水力发电工程处，在一月五日才接到承建模式口水电站工程的任务。上级领导机关要我们在三月底以前完成开挖十二万立方公尺土石的工作量。时间那么紧迫，又是严冬，施工用房一间也没有，营造设备器材料物一时也调运不来（按照规定，至少在二十天以前提出铁路运输计划），技术设计也没有，施工用土地的征购手续没办，水、电系统没布置……一句话，各方面的准备工作都没有头绪，怎么办？
    在这种情况下，我们认定，要完成国家计划，必须争取工期，挤掉施工准备时间。经过多方面的努力，特别是永定河引水工程指挥部、地方党委、政府以及兄弟单位大力支援，我们才迅速解决了好些问题。例如引水工程指挥部帮助解决设备问题，并且协助办理使用土地的征购手续。北京电业管理局供给电源，租给变压器。铁道部疗养院借给水泵房。设计部门赶作了开挖土石方草图。北京铁路局照顾特殊情况，迅速调拨车皮运输器材和物资。由于得到这种可贵的协助，我们在极短促的几天内作好了很多施工准备工作。
    但是，还有一个关键问题，即两千多工人和职员的住房和吃饭问题没解决。天气那样冷，既不能露宿，更不能饿肚子。搭盖房子吧，时间又来不及。唯一的办法是利用工地附近的现有房屋，不过要找到能容纳许多人的住房并不容易。我们一方面先盖些临时房屋作仓库，堆储已经运到的器材物资，同时派人四出联系借房。结果，石景山砖瓦厂帮了忙，利用工厂冬季停工的时期，把工房和两个新式的大砖窑（安上电灯）暂时借给我们用。解放军某部队也腾出一部分房屋，借给我们作工地办公室。砖瓦厂还将炊事房和全套炊事用具借给我们使用。这样，我们从一月十一日开始做施工准备工作（一月十日以前主要是同设计单位联系和勘察工地），五天就大致做好施工准备，一月十六日就动工兴建了。
    开工以后，我们知道砖瓦厂需要烧砖的好土，所以，挖到好土就送给他们，并且用汽车运到砖瓦厂指定的堆土地点。工地开挖出来的土本来是要运走的，送给砖瓦厂既不影响工程成本，而且可使砖瓦厂节省买土和运土的钱。到三月二十日为止，据估计，工地运给砖瓦厂的土有七千多立方公尺，可节省砖瓦厂二万元的投资。我们住了砖瓦厂的房子，可以提早开工，盖好临时房屋后，在工厂开工以前让还他们，不耽误砖瓦生产。
    通过这一具体事实，我们充分体会到，基本建设单位不仅本身有很多潜力可以发掘，并且还有许多方面的有利条件可以利用。在自己的努力下，在多方面的协助下，缩短准备时间和停工时间，充分利用施工时间是完全可能做到的。
