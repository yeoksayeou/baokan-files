Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 25th (via TASS) French Foreign Minister Pineau and Prime Minister Mollet separately received the Soviet journalists delegation on the 24th, who are visiting France at the invitation of the French government.

During his meeting with the Soviet journalists delegation, Pineau emphasized that he has always advocated for contact between the two countries. He said that it is very necessary for engineers, students, journalists, and workers from France and the Soviet Union to visit each other's countries.

Speaking about the upcoming visit of French government leaders to the Soviet Union, Pineau said, "My interest in visiting Moscow stems not only from the perspective of Franco-Soviet relations, but also from the potential role our two countries can play in resolving international issues."

In response to questions from Soviet journalists, Pineau said that France and the Soviet Union have common interests in many areas. However, certain difficulties also exist. He said that as long as there is a pragmatic attitude, it is possible to practically resolve disputes. Pineau also said that closer ties between France and the Soviet Union are not only beneficial to both countries, but also necessary for easing international tensions.

In response to a question about the possibility of convening a new conference on the Indochina issue, Pineau said that the conference would only be interesting if the United States and South Vietnam agreed to participate. Otherwise, in his opinion, the resolutions of the conference would be impossible to implement.

Prime Minister Mollet read a written statement during his meeting with the Soviet journalists delegation.

In his statement, Mollet welcomed them to see all aspects of French social life.

Mollet introduced to the delegation some of the efforts France has made in developing its economy.

Mollet said: "In the international arena, France participates in some alliances... and it intends to maintain its loyalty to them." He also spoke about the measures France has taken in North Africa.

Mollet spoke about the issue of disarmament: "Recently, we have emphasized simultaneous, supervised, and continuous disarmament. As Mr. Khrushchev said in London, this will primarily require long-term efforts. Therefore, until these efforts produce constructive results, we cannot expect to solve other international problems, but we believe that any progress made in this area—which is very important—will have a beneficial impact on other areas."

Mollet said, "We will have the opportunity to discuss all these issues, and undoubtedly others, with your leaders during our upcoming visit."

In response to a question from a member of the delegation regarding the French government's attitude toward the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Mollet said that he hoped not to answer this question before his talks with the leaders of the Soviet government.

    摩勒和比诺分别接见苏联新闻工作者代表团
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎25日讯  法国外交部长比诺和总理摩勒在二十四日分别接见了应法国政府邀请到法国访问的苏联新闻工作者代表团。
    比诺在接见苏联新闻工作者代表团时强调说明他一贯主张两国间的接触。他说，法国和苏联两国的工程师、学生、新闻记者和工人们互相访问彼此的国家是很必要的。
    比诺讲到法国政府的领导人即将访问苏联一事时说：“我对访问莫斯科所以感到兴趣，不仅是从法苏关系的观点出发，而且也考虑到我们两国在解决国际问题上可能发生的作用。”
    比诺在回答苏联新闻工作者的问题的时候说，法国和苏联在许多方面有着共同的利益。但是同时也存在着一定的困难。他说，只要有实事求是的态度，就有可能实际解决争执问题。比诺还说，法苏两国的接近，不仅对两国有利，而且对于缓和国际紧张局势也是必要的。
    在回答召开新的印度支那问题会议的可能性的问题的时候，比诺说，如果美国和南越同意参加，这个会议才能使人感到兴趣。否则，据他的意见，这个会议的决议就不可能实现。
    总理摩勒在接见苏联新闻工作者代表团时宣读了一份书面谈话。
    摩勒在谈话里欢迎他们来看法国社会生活的各个方面。
    摩勒向代表团介绍了法国在发展它的经济方面所作的一些努力。
    摩勒说：“在国际方面，法国参加了一些联盟……它打算保持对它们的忠诚。”摩勒还谈到法国在北非采取的一些措施。
    摩勒谈到裁军问题说：“最近我们强调同时的、受到监督的和连续的裁军。像赫鲁晓夫先生在伦敦所说的，这首先需要作出长期的努力。因此，在这些努力产生出建设性的结果以前，我们不可能指望解决其他的国际问题，但是我们认为在这方面所取得的任何进展——这是非常重要的——将对其他方面产生有利的影响。”
    摩勒说：“所有这些问题以及无疑还有其他一些问题，我们将有机会在我们即将进行的访问中同你们的领导人加以讨论。”
    在答复代表团一个团员提出的关于法国政府对和平共处的五项原则的态度的问题时，摩勒说，他希望在同苏联政府领导人会谈以前不回答这个问题。
