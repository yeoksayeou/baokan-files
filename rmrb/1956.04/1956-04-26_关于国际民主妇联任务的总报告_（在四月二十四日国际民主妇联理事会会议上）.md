Dear friends,

Since the February 1955 meeting of the Executive Council in Geneva to this meeting of the Executive Council, more than a year has passed, during which we have engaged in very intense activities.

In the past year and a half, apart from the Executive Council, three meetings of the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Federation of Women have been held; the World Congress of Mothers was convened, along with two preparatory committee meetings before the Congress; the Standing Committee of the International Congress of Mothers was established, and its first meeting was held; and several international activities were expanded, particularly the celebrations of International Women's Day and the 10th anniversary of the International Democratic Federation of Women, both of which were on an unprecedented scale.

As Mrs. Gordon has just pointed out, the 10th anniversary of the International Democratic Federation of Women is a glorious milestone, giving this Executive Council meeting a solemn and special character.

Over the past ten years, a new phase has begun in the history of the women's movement. Just consider the immense role women play in political, economic, and social life, especially in countries where the democratic women's movement has achieved greater development and strength; consider the tremendous progress of Soviet women, the prospects opening up for women in the people's democracies of Europe and Asia, where women fully participate in all aspects of national life; consider the process undergone by women in Asia: the profound changes in the lives of women in New China, the vigorous development of the women's movement in India, Indonesia, Japan, and other countries; consider the women's movement that has emerged for the first time in Africa and is developing almost throughout the continent, and the achievements of democratic women's organizations in the countries of Latin America.

In every corner of the world, even in the most difficult conditions, in countries where women have been most oppressed, a great new force of women has arisen and taken action. They increasingly feel their responsibilities and rights, and as a powerful force for progress, freedom, and peace, they participate in the lives of the people and international affairs.

The International Democratic Federation of Women was established and developed in this flourishing trend. We can now see its immense role in the lives of women around the world.

To mobilize women to fight for their rights, for the happiness of their children, and for peace, the International Democratic Federation of Women, based on women's deepest desires for justice and happiness, has formulated a program for women of all races, continents, and social classes.

The International Democratic Federation of Women tirelessly strives to make women believe that their hopes can be realized, and that only by organizing and taking action themselves can their hopes be realized.

Wherever women are supporting arduous struggles, the International Democratic Federation of Women provides support. Therefore, millions of women have come to understand the suffering and courage of women in Spain, Greece, Korea, Vietnam, Iran, Kenya, Algeria, Cameroon, and other countries.

In the International Democratic Federation of Women, women from countries with different social and political systems come together, enabling them to get to know each other directly, build friendships, break down barriers, and greatly encourage their common struggles.

In all its activities, the International Democratic Federation of Women relentlessly strives to strengthen women's unity, considering this the main condition for achieving success. Especially in the recent period, this development has been manifested in the achievements of cooperation with other women's forces, uniting with other women's forces to strive for the realization of the overall common goal of liberation and peace.

On a global scale, this is manifested in the spirit of the resolution adopted by the Copenhagen Congress at the suggestion of the Indian delegation, that is, the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation between non-member organizations and individuals of the International Democratic Federation of Women; it is manifested in the great international conference, the World Congress of Mothers, which recently expressed its trust in the International Democratic Federation of Women once again; it is manifested in the establishment of the Standing Committee of the International Congress of Mothers, which has laid a permanent foundation for cooperation between various women's forces and the International Democratic Federation of Women.

Such achievements of the International Democratic Federation of Women are something we all have reason to be proud of. However, these achievements also bring us an increasingly heavy responsibility to meet the demands and new tasks posed by women in the continuous progress of their peoples' lives and the current situation.

In the recent period, significant events have occurred both within countries and internationally, which have profoundly changed the awareness of millions of men and women. In the face of the terrible threat of atomic bombs and the heavy burden of military expenditures due to the fierce arms race, a great prospect of negotiation and peace has opened up for the peoples of various countries. The strengthening struggle of millions of men and women against war preparations and for the easing of tensions, based on the principle of coexistence, has already achieved some very significant successes: first of all, the convening of the Geneva Conference and the Bandung Conference, which proved that all disputes can be resolved through negotiations, and at the same time proved that new relations can be established between countries on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation. On the ground, a real peace zone has appeared. The governments of countries with more than half the world's population, based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence first established by India and China, have established their relations on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of each country and on an equal footing.

The peoples of various countries deeply believe that peace can be won. The desire for freedom and progress has prompted millions of men and women to rise up to smash the chains of colonialism and strive for liberation. Great victories have been achieved in Asia, where colonialism has suffered serious and irreversible defeats; Africa has also achieved great victories, where the peoples of various countries continue to achieve their desire for freedom. Everywhere, women enthusiastically participate in the struggle for independence and against colonialism, feeling that colonialism is the root cause of the suffering of their compatriots, the root cause of the miserable lives of women and mothers. Thus, in the countries advancing on the path of progress and peace, in the process of liberation struggles, a great prospect has been opened up for the fair and happy future of millions of women and children.

However, the great struggle for peace has not yet been won, the arms race continues, aggressive treaties are still dividing the world and maintaining tension in some regions, and atomic energy, which could bring profound changes to the lives of the peoples of various countries and achieve amazing results for humanity, is being used as a weapon of destruction. Military budgets weigh heavily on the shoulders of the people; the boundless wealth that could be used to improve the lives of millions of people is still being used to manufacture death. Here is just one example of this evil deed: in the past six years, the majority of member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty have increased their budgets two to three times; from 1949 to 1955, the amount spent by the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty on armaments was almost nine hundred times the amount allocated by the United Nations for aid to backward countries.

Women's consciences cannot tolerate such a situation. Driven by conscience, the number of women participating in the struggle to achieve peace is increasing and becoming more united.

They increasingly realize that maintaining and strengthening peace is not only the main condition for protecting the lives of millions of people and the vast wealth on Earth, but also the main condition for ensuring that humanity, every family, and every child live a life of progress and happiness.

The actions of member organizations in various countries reflect this demand. They have effectively supported the movement initiated by the World Peace Council to oppose atomic weapons. In various parts of the world, especially in Europe and Asia, they have strongly participated in national struggles against military treaties and measures to strengthen armaments, while supporting initiatives to ease international tensions and achieve universal security.

In the course of these struggles, women's organizations have increasingly put forward their own, unique initiatives within the overall scope of action. This shows that they are aware of the important and decisive role women should play in maintaining peace. Since women make up half of humanity, their mission in society imposes on them an unavoidable duty. Such initiatives, in line with the more specific feelings, concerns, and wishes of women, enable them to reach more women, meet their demands for unity and action, and explain to them the major issues facing the peoples of the world, which are often deliberately made vague before being presented to them.

Here, we would like to point out the commendable activities of Japanese women, especially the leaders of the Japan Federation of Democratic Women's Organizations. Last year, the leaders of the Japan Federation of Democratic Women's Organizations issued an appeal to women around the world to ban the testing of atomic weapons, and organized delegations, films, and reports in various countries, which helped millions of women understand the hatred of atomic weapons. We would also like to mention the actions taken by German women in the struggle against the Paris Agreements, which forcibly revived German militarism, such as the demonstration by 12,000 women in Bonn and 173 delegations from all over the country during the parliamentary debate on these agreements, showing their strength.

We would also like to point out the strength of the French Women's Union in its actions to stop the fighting in Algeria and restore peace, supporting the strong gatherings of French mothers expressing the demands of thousands of soldiers' mothers against sending their children to North Africa.

The demand to reduce military spending and increase peace funds is increasingly strongly expressed in the actions of women in many countries to meet the social and cultural needs of families. While demanding immediate universal disarmament measures, women in various countries are not only avoiding the danger of war but also reaffirming their right to progress and greater happiness.

For the same purpose, women in various countries, especially those in backward countries that are severely affected by the limitations of economic and commercial development, demand the development of trade relations with all countries on an equal footing. For example, almost all women's organizations in Latin American countries have put forward such demands.

The exchange of women's delegations between countries, especially between countries with different systems, has been increasingly developed, like a powerful current of friendship and understanding, strongly aiding the cause of peace. An important new situation in this movement is that delegations include not only members of official organizations but also leaders and representatives of these organizations, which is an increasingly prominent feature of the composition of delegations. In this regard, we would particularly like to point out that the visits of delegations to various places have aroused the interest of a wide range of people and public opinion, and established contacts with various different organizations at the time of reception: for example, in Mumbai and New Delhi, 29 women's organizations jointly organized the reception for Madame Song Qingling.

To express women's opposition to all forms of war preparation and their strong will for negotiation and peace, the International Democratic Federation of Women proposed convening the World Congress of Mothers to protect their children from the harm of war, strive for disarmament and friendship between the peoples of various countries, and with the greatest strength put forward the responsibility of mothers who, having given life, have a sacred duty to protect life.

For the first time in history, this proposal was realized, causing a great resonance in the hearts of women; it aroused new great forces and formed an unprecedented driving force for unity.

Here, we would like to reiterate the words of Mrs. A. Stapleton, Vice-Chairman of the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom, in her congratulatory message to the Congress: "The thoughts of mothers and grandmothers have no East or West. Let the nature of motherhood and the responsibility we all feel for the welfare of children in various countries constitute a bridge for mutual understanding between peoples of different political thoughts, and such understanding will make any war between them impossible."

Mrs. Claudette Gascogni, a member of the Italian Catholic Women's Action League, reiterated this desire for mutual understanding and cooperation in her speech at the Congress. She said: "Let us, the mothers who believe in Catholicism and are attending the Congress, come together to talk and encourage each other to act, so that when we return to our homes, we can continue our efforts with greater strength to remove man-made obstacles and unite all women who, like us, truly seek and demand peace for their children..."

Mrs. Kaul, the Minister of Health of India, made a respectable speech at the Congress: "We must drive out the fear, because fear is the most evil enemy of mankind, the main factor of the arms race, and fear can only be driven out by love, only love can conquer everything."

The great significance of such a grand activity and its contribution to easing international tensions, as well as the prospects it has opened up, can be seen from the great response it has received in various newspapers and in various countries that are extremely different from each other, as well as the response it has received within important organizations in various countries and internationally.

To ensure the victory of the Congress resolutions and to make the unity that guarantees the implementation of the resolutions permanent, the Congress adopted a proposal to establish an International Standing Committee of Mothers, with Madame Andrée Andry, Vice-Chairman of the International Democratic Federation of Women, as its chairperson.

The first meeting of the Standing Committee, attended by representatives from 36 countries, marked a further development in friendly cooperation in the struggle for peace. Many prominent women present are members of various different organizations in their countries and internationally, and often leaders, such as the International Democratic Federation of Women, the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom, the Women's Department of the World Federalist Movement, the German Women's Peace Movement, the American peace organization "Save Our Children Committee," and the Polish Catholic organization "Peace," and so on.

Mrs. Phoebe Coston, Vice-Chairman of the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom and a member of the Standing Committee of Mothers, said: "We must mobilize the greatest force of humanity. If used appropriately and moderately, this force can change international relations." Thus, she expressed a basic spirit that permeates every work of the Committee, making the basic spirit of unity among all women representatives, despite their representing various extremely different experiences, views, and traditions.

The Mother's Declaration adopted by the Standing Committee of Mothers announced the fundamental demands of mothers: to abandon war as a means of resolving disputes; universal reduction of armaments; prohibition of the use of thermonuclear weapons and cessation of tests; use of the world's resources to benefit humanity—first of all, to improve the living conditions of children.

This document concludes by stating: "We demand that the dignity of mothers, which has always been sung by artists and poets, be fully respected in our society, and we demand that the will and wishes of women be given due consideration in all assemblies that decide the present and future of humanity."

The great struggle of mothers to protect their children from war should be vigorously promoted on this basis in the vast majority of countries. The demands put forward in the Declaration cannot fail to resonate deeply in the hearts of every mother. Every mother must know these demands, support these demands, and put them forward to the governments, parliaments, and public opinion of various countries.

The Committee decided to submit the "Mother's Declaration" to the United Nations General Assembly to be held this autumn, emphasizing that if this Declaration can obtain the support of famous individuals and organizations, the Committee will have greater authority. This is an urgent task that the Committee has put forward to its members and the individuals and organizations that support it.

This is an urgent task for our member organizations, which should provide the most effective support to the members of the Committee.

After the successful conclusion of the World Congress of Mothers, we all feel that we have taken on a great responsibility: to support the demands of the Congress, to consolidate and develop its achievements. Undoubtedly, the member organizations of various countries have studied the issues raised in the "Declaration" and, on this basis, sought concrete initiatives that can mobilize millions of women to take joint action and unite different organizations and movements on the basis of increasingly expanding cooperation for peace.

Today, the united actions of millions of men and women can achieve understanding between the governments of various countries, can achieve the victory of the principles of peaceful coexistence, disarmament, and negotiation; here, every individual, every organization bears an increasingly heavy responsibility.

Some organizations, which in the past regarded the social and educational aspects of women's lives as their sole task, have now also raised the issue of defending peace.

Many international organizations, such as the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom, which has a long and glorious tradition in the struggle for peace, the International Cooperative Women's Alliance, and their member organizations in many countries, have already taken a strong stance on the prohibition of atomic weapons, the reduction of armaments, and the easing of tensions. The Socialist International Women's Committee, in its recent meeting, condemned the use of scientific inventions for destructive purposes and demanded that all political leaders seek peaceful solutions to international problems. During Easter, the leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Pius XII, for the third time expressed his condemnation of thermonuclear weapons and the blind race to prepare for destructive wars.

In many organizations, forces representing the common will of millions of women to take joint action have developed, and these forces increasingly feel the need for cooperation and discussion between different organizations.

We should spare no effort to help all women who want to defend peace to unite; to make the will and influence of women and mothers in international life form an increasingly strong pressure on the governments of various countries; to attract millions of other women from all over the world to the great struggle for peace and the defense of life.

The victory of life is, first of all, the safety and happy growth of all our children. Therefore, the World Congress of Mothers and the International Standing Committee of Mothers, while strongly advocating disarmament, also put forward the demand to use the financial resources of the state first to ensure the health, education, and necessary guarantees of children, and to educate them in the spirit of justice and peace.

The Congress of Mothers expressed to the United Nations the strong support of mothers around the world for efforts made for such a noble purpose. The Congress pointed out that to ensure the harmonious development of children in material and spiritual aspects, immediate action must be taken and pointed out the special tasks of mothers. Children are powerless to protect themselves, and society should provide protection, and the government should fulfill its responsibilities to them.

Many social and educational organizations and associations have attracted enthusiastic and professional individuals to carry out activities that are often on a large scale. There are not many causes that stir human emotions, arouse people's sincere enthusiasm, and touch people's hearts like the cause of protecting children.

The International Congress for the Defense of Children, held in 1952, solemnly exposed the tragic situation of children in many countries before world public opinion. The Congress, with a heart that loves black, white, and yellow children equally, wrote in its letter to all men and women of the world: "Today, tens of millions of children—the most precious treasures of all humanity—are under the threat of hunger, ignorance, fear, and death."

"In the entire African, Latin American, and most of the Asian regions, in countries with extremely rich natural resources, there are millions of children who have no bread, no shelter, and no care; more than half of them die before they are two or three years old, even before they have felt what life is! The rest of the children, even if they survive, will live in a state of ignorance! Half of all humanity is illiterate..."

Now we can say that the problems emphasized at that time have at least been partially solved, and the situation of children has improved significantly? The facts of every day tell us: the situation of children is still very serious.

Member organizations in various countries have always been good at reflecting the most urgent needs of children in each country and, on a local basis, demanding the establishment of schools, taking health measures, building medical institutions, kindergartens, and organizing their cultural and recreational activities as much as possible.

One factor marking the development of children's work is that in many countries, based on legislative drafts, national movements have been launched to the government, and individuals, groups, and organizations dedicated to the defense of children have united to realize these legislative drafts.

For example, the struggle for children's reading materials and healthy education, against the poisoning of children's morals, is becoming universal. In all Nordic countries, Britain, Australia, Burma, the United States, and many other countries, movements have been launched. In Sweden, which published 30 million copies of "children's books" in 1954, teachers and parents of students participated in the action. In Colombia, a movement participated by teachers forced the government to ban the sale of "children's books."

Important legislative drafts have been formulated, especially in France, the apprenticeship law draft, in Italy, the children's allowance law draft, in Argentina and Chile, the nursery and kindergarten law drafts. The issue of schools and the right to education has been strongly raised in Italy, Israel, and Indonesia. Women in South Africa, in their struggle against racial discrimination, have more strongly risen up against a measure to limit the time black children attend school: the "Bantu Education Act."

Many organizations have taken on the task of seeking temporary remedies for these extremely painful situations with great enthusiasm. Facing problems of a universal and serious nature, this is necessary; especially when these initiatives are supported by the people, this can achieve certain results. For example, some organizations in India and Indonesia have established schools, and in Burma, children's institutions have been established... However, it must be clearly seen that these problems can only be truly and permanently solved when the state takes on the fate of children, when the necessary funds are obtained and policies in line with national interests are determined.

Although these works have been completed, we must admit that the scale of our actions to protect children is still not broad enough, and the strength is not great enough. We cannot say that we have been good at uniting all the forces that want to act for children, nor can we say that we have given sufficient attention to all the initiatives and movements launched by various forces to achieve this purpose.

As long as there is one problem that has not entered the path of solution, our actions should be unremitting and increasingly powerful to put it forward. Public opinion does not always know the seriousness and breadth of the problem (often nationwide). More and more important initiatives can be put forward to make doctors, writers, educators, mothers, fathers, and various organizations combine their forces to protect children, and through the exchange of delegations, the exchange of information, the holding of children's literature or children's art exhibitions, to develop international exchanges, to help children of different countries and different races understand and love each other more and more, to help children of different countries and different races understand and love each other more and more.

Many gatherings are held for children, such as Children's Day, Mother's Day, etc. These celebratory activities often have an official character, mobilizing millions of men and women and organizations, showing that the fate of children is a matter of great concern to everyone. These activities give those who want to protect children the opportunity to put forward their demands again.

The "June 1st" International Children's Day is coming soon. Last year's "June 1st" was celebrated in the atmosphere of enthusiastic preparations for the "World Congress of Mothers." We hope that this year's "June 1st" Children's Day will mark a new development in our activities, and hope that it will be an opportunity for children to more strongly demand the right to live, to be healthy, and to be educated, and to make everyone in the world understand the demands solemnly announced by mothers in the Lausanne Declaration.

There is enough wealth on Earth to feed all the children in the world. The level of science and technology, if used for peace, can create a happy world for the children of the present and the future. No one is more willing than women and mothers to devote all their strength to realize this wish.

Women feel that in the struggle to protect the lives of their children, in the struggle of the peoples of various countries for peace and freedom, they are playing a new role, and they are aware of the important contribution they make to social progress with their labor and talents. This feeling and awareness make them increasingly powerful and urgent in demanding the full recognition of their rights in all aspects of life. They demand an end to their unfair and despised situation, and demand that their dignity as mothers, workers, and citizens be respected.

The status of women in society is a fundamental issue of the women's movement, a matter of concern to all women of all countries and all social classes.

In this regard, some decisive achievements have been made, greatly encouraging the desire of women around the world for equality and progress: in some countries, women have been granted full rights and some social conditions have been guaranteed so that women can increasingly effectively enjoy these rights. Members of delegations that have visited the Soviet Union, people's democracies, and China, after seeing the new status of women in national life, their ability to participate in all professions, receive education and further education, and the care given to mothers, have all expressed their enthusiastic emotions. We just need to think of the following fact: in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, there are now 348 women, that is, 25.8% of all elected representatives; if we compare this percentage with the 3.6% in the French National Assembly, 4% in the Norwegian Parliament, and 3.3% in the U.S. Congress, its significance becomes even greater.

We can also think of Chinese women, who are vigorously participating in the social and political life of their country, with 17.3% of local administrative positions held by women.

We can also think of small Albania, where not long ago women were deprived of all social and political rights, but now 2,156 women have been elected as representatives of local people's assemblies, and 16 women have been elected as representatives of the National People's Assembly.

In these ten years, some other important progress has also been made: in 28 countries, women have obtained the right to vote. Many countries have solemnly recognized women's rights in their constitutions. In some countries, women's certain rights have also been recognized by law, such as the right to equal pay. However, in a large region of the world, there are still great obstacles preventing women from exercising even the rights they have already obtained. They should struggle to enforce the law, oppose legal restrictions, and oppose economic and social conditions that do not guarantee their progress in life. As long as poverty, illiteracy, lack of social welfare facilities, etc., oppress women in their daily lives, we cannot say that they are reasonably enjoying their rights. When millions of women cannot find work and suffer from savage over-exploitation, when democratic freedoms are violated, organizations that protect women are persecuted, and publications that enlighten women are controlled or even banned, we cannot say that they are reasonably enjoying their rights. The situation of women in colonial countries and backward countries is particularly serious, where the inequality and oppression women suffer in society and the family are deeply rooted.

The International Democratic Federation of Women, from its inception, has regarded the struggle for women's rights as one of the most important tasks of the democratic women's movement. The Copenhagen Women's Congress strongly raised the issue of the status of women in modern society, and in the "Declaration of Rights," listed all the political, civil, economic, and social rights that all women, regardless of race, nationality, and social status, should enjoy; it called on women around the world to cooperate closely and take persistent, organized action to win their rights.

Thus, the issue of women's rights has been strongly raised as an issue of justice and progress. This issue is not only related to the lives of some women with higher social status but is also related to the lives of millions of women and is closely linked to the demands of female workers, peasant women, and women who suffer the most. These women want a more humane and appropriate life. Thus, the struggle for women's liberation has become an important factor in the progress of social life and democratic life in various countries. It is an important factor in their struggle for freedom and happiness.

The demand for political rights—the right to vote and be elected—is one of the primary rights demanded by women. Recently, women in Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Switzerland, and Peru have put forward this demand, and different women's organizations in each of these countries have expressed the same demand, sometimes taking joint action.

Moroccan women, in their struggle for national independence, have removed the veil from thousands of women, strongly demanding the right to vote and participate in all work. The Women's Union of Tunisia declared: "Women, in anti-colonialist demonstrations, in prisons, and in concentration camps, are always side by side with their husbands and sons. When the National Constituent Assembly is elected, they will not allow any discrimination between men and women."

Title: The Struggle for Women's Rights and the Development of the Women's Movement

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th.

In recent years, women in many countries have actively participated in elections, demonstrating their commitment to their responsibilities as wives, mothers, and patriots. They have demanded the right to vote regardless of social status or educational background. This trend has been observed in countries like Tunisia, Indonesia, France, Finland, Italy, and Brazil. In Brazil, the election of the republican president was seen as a struggle for democracy and independence, and numerous women's election committees were formed, involving women from various parties and organizations.

Women's organizations have correctly linked their struggle for rights with the development of democratic life in their countries and have presented their specific demands to those guiding national policies. In countries like Italy, Brazil, Chile, and India, female legislators have proposed important legislative initiatives based on women's organizational platforms and constitutional principles of equality. These proposals have gained momentum and effectiveness due to the support of millions of women through their actions and struggles.

As women have become more involved in political life, their fight against racial discrimination has also intensified. In countries like Nigeria, Senegal, Congo, and South Africa, women have opposed unfair racial discrimination measures targeting women and children of color. This reflects the growing sentiment of millions of women, particularly in Africa and Asia, and contributes significantly to the struggle for human rights and democratic freedoms in these countries.

The development of democratic life has inspired women to break free from oppressive customs and traditions in society and even within families, demanding recognition of their civic rights. In many of our member organizations, there are calls for legislation to establish women's rights in marriage, property, and motherhood. For example, in countries like India, Indonesia, Japan, and Israel, as well as in Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and West Germany, there are demands for legal reforms to address these issues. Often, these problems lead to tragic situations. In most countries, mothers' rights are subjected to intolerable discrimination, and in many cases, children are taken from their mothers without regard for their emotions or natural rights.

Therefore, more countries should pay attention to these issues, as they affect women from all walks of life and increasingly contradict public progress. In our era, there is no country where women do not participate in production. Women work in factories, fields, hospitals, schools, and offices, contributing to society with their labor, from the highest to the lowest technical skills.

In countries like Britain, Italy, France, the United States, West Germany, and Japan, there are over sixty million women earning wages. In industrially advanced countries, nearly 40% of the workforce is female. Additionally, there are hundreds of millions of women working in agriculture.

In many countries, life is difficult, and the number of women seeking work is increasing. However, women demand the right to work not just as an economic necessity but as a condition of human dignity, providing them with opportunities for development and deeper participation in social life. Women's labor is a great creative force that should be supported and encouraged to serve the development of the motherland.

It is not enough to recognize women's right to work in theory; it must be practiced in economic and social life, allowing millions of women from different social backgrounds to fully exercise this right. To this end, member organizations in countries like India, Italy, and Argentina have launched significant actions to fight for women's employment rights, opposing the lack of job opportunities and demanding more work for women and young girls; opposing unemployment and the dismissal of workers, especially protecting the jobs of married women; advocating for the establishment of social welfare institutions to reduce women's household labor and ensure the care of their children; and recognizing the labor of women engaged in various types of work, such as home-based workers, domestic workers, and millions of rural women whose labor is often heavy and arduous but not recognized by society.

In many countries, women face severe discrimination in the workplace, which not only harms the dignity of working women but also devalues the general value of human labor. The phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work is serious, even in economically advanced countries: in Italy and France, the wage gap is 15% to 20%; in the United States, it is 29%; in Britain, it can reach 40% in some cases; and in Japan, it can be as high as 60% to 65% in some sectors.

Women face special difficulties in career advancement, and economic crises and excessive exploitation particularly affect women, deepening existing discrimination. For example, from 1952 to 1953, Japan's textile industry production increased by 70%, but the number of female textile workers decreased by 40%.

Workplace accidents are increasing, and excessive labor often seriously damages women's health. Social protection legislation, especially legislation protecting maternity, is insufficient. The most unfairly treated and most miserable are rural women. In the Americas, Africa, and Asia, rural women make up the majority of women. They often work under extremely harsh conditions: long, endless working days, extremely low wages, or no wages at all, unpaid labor, lack of basic labor tools, various forms of forced labor, and no social welfare or health facilities.

More and more working women no longer tolerate such conditions. They have put forward their demands and are fighting to achieve them. Women's organizations are intensifying and making more effective efforts to safeguard the rights and dignity of working women. In various countries, movements supporting the living demands of working women, such as female workers, rural women, female teachers, and female civil servants, are developing. These movements expose the plight of working women and raise the issues of working mothers.

To defend the principle of equal pay for equal work, some women's organizations have launched continuous campaigns. They actively support the struggle for increased wages for workers and strongly support the special demands of female workers. The struggle to narrow the wage gap between men and women has achieved significant victories in countries like Italy, Argentina, and Spain.

The International Democratic Federation of Women often emphasizes that our work among rural women is insufficient, especially in countries where rural women make up the majority of the female population. We should point out that there have been some progress in certain countries recently. Women's organizations often call on rural women to participate in the peasants' struggle and put forward their own demands. Under the initiative of women's organizations, in countries like Italy, Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, Costa Rica, and Lebanon, several national-scale major initiatives have been taken, such as Rural Women's Day and Rural Women's Conferences, national or regional conferences of agricultural women workers and agricultural workers' families, where issues such as recognizing work rights, land ownership and use rights, protecting mothers, improving rural living conditions, and protecting peasant families have been raised.

In the large-scale national initiatives launched by our member organizations to affirm women's rights, special emphasis has been placed on the rights of working women. For example, Finland held a conference on women's rights. When preparing for the fifth national congress of Italian women, the Italian Women's Union conducted a nationwide referendum, distributing four million questionnaires that addressed issues such as child allowances, schools, housing, pensions, rising living costs, and strongly advocated for women's labor rights and equal pay, making these the main aspects of the struggle for women's liberation.

Concrete actions have helped women realize that their struggle for their own rights and economic demands is closely linked to the struggle for national progress. Women in countries like Syria, India, Indonesia, and Burma demand new jobs, rapid development of national industry and technology, and free trade, thus contributing effectively to the struggle for peace, progress, and national construction.

However, we must point out that our actions to defend labor rights and the rights of laborers are generally insufficient and weak in some countries. While emphasizing the achievements made, we particularly feel that actions to defend the rights of peasant women are weak, although the scope of this issue is very broad. Millions of peasant women remain isolated, unsupported, and unrecognized.

The International Democratic Federation of Women warmly welcomes the World Federation of Trade Unions' decision to hold a World Women Workers' Conference in June 1956. The conference's agenda mainly includes defending wages, implementing the principle of equal pay for equal work, opposing all forms of discrimination, improving the living conditions of working women, and defending peace.

For the first time in history, on such a global scale, the issue of women's labor rights is being presented to all trade union organizations, all working people, and public opinion. This is urgently necessary from the perspective of the interests of all working people and the living conditions of the people in various countries.

Member organizations of the International Democratic Federation of Women are actively participating in the preparations for the women workers' conference, striving to ensure its success, and will redouble their efforts to work among working women.

In places where working women have not yet joined unions or where their demands have not been sufficiently recognized by union organizations, the role of women's organizations becomes even more necessary.

Everywhere, our task is to propagate the purposes of the World Women Workers' Conference to public opinion, among working women and all women, to provide the strongest support for the rights and demands of working women, and to convey the support of all women to those working women who are struggling. Because women realize that the recognition of the rights of working women is a fundamental achievement in the struggle for the respect of all women's status and the full recognition of women's rights in society.

Science, with the discovery of atomic energy, serves humanity. The application of atomic energy will bring prosperity and happiness to the people of the world. The elimination of poverty and hunger on Earth is within reach.

However, according to official figures released by the United Nations, 59% of the world's population is currently malnourished, compared to 31% in 1939.

In most countries, the number of doctors, maternity hospitals, hospitals, nurseries, schools, and hygienic housing is insufficient, and in some countries, they are almost non-existent. Relief efforts often rely on private initiatives and charitable activities. Terrible diseases are rampant on three continents, and these diseases can often be cured with minimal treatment.

This is a fundamental and major issue that involves women's social rights. These issues require solutions to ensure and improve the living conditions of millions of women and children. Women's organizations can greatly help in the continuous struggle for women's social and cultural progress, as every achievement in these areas is a contribution to the improvement and progress of the entire national life. We would like to emphasize some good initiatives, such as India's maternal protection movement, Indonesia's campaign to increase schools and eradicate illiteracy, Iraq's recent movement to protect mothers and children, Italy's campaign for family allowances for housewives, France, Sweden, Belgium's campaign for family allowances, Denmark's campaign for single women's allowances, Canada's health protection movement, and France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and many other countries' promotion of painless childbirth.

Women are sensitive to all these movements, and these movements can promote broad cooperation among women and various organizations. The realization of these demands will inevitably affect national finances, and these organizations naturally demand that governments reduce military spending to fund peaceful endeavors. In other countries, the demand is to include these demands within the scope of national social and economic life development. For example, recently, the All-India Women's Conference proposed demands related to maternal issues when the Indian government formulated the national economic plan.

In this regard, we would also like to emphasize that many organizations are conducting social and cultural activities at the local level to meet women's cultural and mutual aid needs, helping them to meet each other, and promoting their social lives.

In recent times, the heavy burden of military budgets and the intervention of foreign interest groups in national economies have worsened the living conditions of many people. Under such circumstances, women's organizations are currently taking notable actions to defend the living standards of families.

In Britain, the Women's Cooperative Society initiated a nationwide campaign against rising prices, which received widespread support from members of other organizations. Such movements developed last year and spread to more and more countries, such as France, Italy, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Austria. In Latin America, this movement has particular importance: democratic women's organizations play a major role throughout Latin America.

The wives of workers actively participated in the struggle for wage increases and against layoffs to defend their children's bread. They often play a decisive role in achieving victory in these struggles. Many countries support workers' economic demands, and women support them. We only need to point out that in some countries, the wives of workers launched a real support movement, which united many women to fight and often became regular and had an important activity program.

We would like to emphasize the demand for greater efforts in all places to support these movements, to develop support for male and female workers, and to provide full material and spiritual support to all women for their struggles, as their struggles are very important for defending the living standards of the people.

The struggle to realize urgent demands and defend families is linked to the worsening, often tragic worsening, of the situation of millions of families. The women who need to be defended are the most affected and often the most isolated. We should be good at talking to them, discussing their problems, suggesting solutions, giving them confidence, and guiding them to take action. Wherever women and children need support, we should go there and actively participate.

When women demand equal rights, when they demand social and cultural measures to improve their living standards, when they defend their families, they are fighting for progress and justice in the name of this fundamental demand.

To make this demand clearer and more definite, we should conduct more frequent and in-depth explanatory and educational work to discuss women's status issues, help women understand themselves better, and promote public discussion of this issue. We would like to draw your attention to the need to better study the help that women's publications can provide in this regard. We must mobilize and, more than ever, mobilize women's abilities, their contributions to progress and people's struggles, and their role in society.

The struggle for women's rights has a deep tradition in the women's movement; for nearly a century, the brave pioneers of women's liberation have been fighting for this cause, and many organizations have long included this demand in their platforms and taken actions to achieve it.

In some organizations that have always had their own stance on this issue, such as the Catholic organizations in Italy, women's growing aspirations have made progress, and actions in the democratic movement have also made progress. These organizations have taken a stand on certain issues, although they have not consistently followed up with effective actions after taking a stand, these stances are progressive, supportive of women's equality, and supportive of improving women's lives.

Women's fundamental rights have been established in the principles of the United Nations Charter, and the issue of women's status is now being discussed in several United Nations bodies, in the parliaments of various countries, in many trade unions, and in a large part of the press.

Due to the achievements of women's activities and the historic victories of progress on the road to progress by the Soviet Union, China, and people's democratic countries, women around the world have a greater awareness of the need and possibility to fundamentally change their living conditions. This awareness must be embodied in a powerful, organized struggle and practical action movement. This awareness must be constantly raised. The struggle for women's rights—the struggle for the realization of this ideal, which is self-evident for the women's movement and very important for the progress of various countries—must be made stronger, more frequent, and become the fundamental struggle of democratic organizational life that can unite many women into a powerful force for civilization and peace.

Dear friends, the International Democratic Federation of Women and member organizations in various countries have always been concerned with meeting the growing hopes of women, with meeting the hopes of millions of awakening women, and with their growing desire for mutual contact, mutual understanding, and joint action. Everything mentioned above reflects our concern, and we will stop our research here.

The women's democratic movement has thus grown stronger around the world. We can cite some figures to see the scale of this progress: the International Democratic Federation of Women maintains regular contact with women's organizations in seventy-four countries and has regular exchanges with women's organizations or individuals in another thirteen countries.

In Asia and Africa, for example, in Indonesia, India, Japan, Nigeria, and South Africa, the rapid development of mass-based new women's organizations is particularly remarkable. In African countries, such as the Congo, Sudan, Senegal, and Ivory Coast, women are organizing and increasingly participating in international actions. Recently, the Cameroon Democratic Women's Union and the Ceylon Free Party Women's Organization have applied to join the International Democratic Federation of Women.

A fact of great significance to the entire international movement is that the number of American women participating in various organizations fighting for peace and domestic democracy in the United States is increasing, and our relationship with these organizations' representatives is developing. An important aspect of the recent meetings of the World Mothers' Congress and the Standing Committee of the World Mothers is that the speeches and greetings of American dignitaries express the desire for unity and peace of American women.

From 1955 to 1956, a total of fifty-three representative conferences and national conferences were held, which proves the frequency and scale of the activities of various organizations.

The progress in women's publications also shows the strengthening of the women's movement. In more than forty countries, ninety-six democratic women's publications are circulated, of which eight were newly established last year. Some were established in Colombia, Indonesia, Sudan, and other countries, which previously had no democratic women's publications.

The celebration of the tenth anniversary of the International Democratic Federation of Women shows our federation's growing prestige around the world. This year's celebration of International Women's Day has a particularly grand scale, with many celebrations held in various forms. This again shows the broad unity that can be achieved among different types of women and organizations participating in the defense of women's rights and peace. (In Egypt, the tenth anniversary was celebrated for the first time.)

To adapt to the rapid rise of the movement, to adapt to the various strong demands put forward by women, and to adapt to the increasing possibility of unity, the women's movement is seeking new forms of organization, leadership, and action.

Different countries have some meaningful experiences in this regard. For example, in India and Japan, some organizations are of a united nature in their organizational structure, thus uniting many different types of regional or local associations. These organizations propose the need to develop nationwide activities that unite various associations in each country, strengthen the united leadership of these activities, and strengthen the connections between these activities. The French Women's Union has established several national committees, some of which are national committees for peace, some for women's rights, and some for social and cultural activities, etc. Non-members but those interested in a few points in their platforms can participate. The Italian Women's Union strives to turn local committees and small groups into real women's activity venues, where all local women can participate according to the activity platforms of social, cultural, and life demands.

Some of our member organizations have assisted in the establishment of committees of various forms; in these committees, different women's organizations gather together to jointly implement a jointly decided platform. For example, in France, a women's committee against German militarism was established; in West Germany, Japan, and Israel, national mothers' committees were established; in Brazil, a women's committee for national liberation and a committee against rising prices were established. Internationally, the establishment of the Standing Committee of the World Mothers is also in line with the evolution of the women's movement.

However, we must say that this development is uneven and not satisfactory everywhere. There are still too many countries that seem to have the conditions for a democratic women's movement but still do not have one. The democratic women's organizations in these countries unite and influence very few women; especially in some countries, if we compare the female population in each country, the situation is even worse.

To enable the democratic women's movement to develop everywhere, even under extremely difficult conditions, to adapt to the new possibilities opened up by the current situation, and to make the views advocated by our federation valued by many women in all countries, member organizations should establish closer ties with women's masses, unremittingly defend and support them in their various demands movements. We are not only referring to the most aware and active women but also to those who are seeking how to act, to the millions of women who face their own problems and difficulties but are often scattered and do not fight.

We should constantly propose more initiatives, with greater vigor to face the possibilities of action, guide women to take action themselves, fight, discard passivity and fatalism, and make them understand that their own future and the future of their children depend on their own actions.

We should help women in various ways: through speeches, setting up training classes and schools, developing discussions and democratic life within organizations, thus raising their awareness, enhancing their abilities, and strengthening their contributions to the development and leadership of the movement.

Facing the growing desire of women to overcome all differences and meet and understand each other, member organizations now bear a particularly important task: to help develop the spirit of friendship, unity, and cooperation among women and women's organizations.

The experience of recent years shows: national and international organizations, although they express different traditions and ideas and act in different situations, the problems they raise are common because these problems are in line with the main wishes of all women who want peace, hope for the improvement of their own and their children's living conditions.

Experience also tells us: every step forward, every victory, even a partial victory, in solving this or that problem, is a great and universal will achieved by pushing different forces towards the same goal.

We believe that today, conditions exist everywhere in the world to promote mutual meetings and joint actions to solve the most fundamental problems, to realize the desire for such meetings.

Therefore, member organizations in various countries and the International Democratic Federation of Women itself have the responsibility to act with greater courage, more resolutely and confidently in this direction. We believe that the representatives of women's organizations and the women's movement should meet in various countries or international venues to increase mutual understanding, exchange experiences, compare work, and study the possibility of joint action, at least gradually achieving unified action.

The new situation of the development of the women's movement and the new possibilities of cooperation require us to deeply study the forms and methods of our work.

Dear friends, we ask you to contribute to the discussion based on the rich experience of member organizations, the achievements of your work in this direction, your plans, your suggestions, and your criticisms, so that our federation can better fulfill its new tasks in various countries and internationally. We particularly ask you to express your opinions on the necessity of gatherings of different organizations in various countries and internationally. The success of gatherings of international women's organization representatives depends to a large extent on the progress made in cooperation within countries and between countries; such international gatherings will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the strengthening of the spirit of unity and cooperation everywhere; thus, it guarantees that the cause of peace, children's happiness, and women's rights will achieve new important victories.

Dear friends, on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the International Democratic Federation of Women, we can proudly review the road we have traveled. We can joyfully point out the important achievements that mark this period: the establishment of new organizations; the development of the movement in Asia and Africa; the new scale and influence of the activities of most organizations; the progress made in cooperation with other women's forces; and the successful cultivation of thousands of brave, capable, and loyal new women leaders, who have gained increasing experience and prestige in action, and who are the most reliable guarantee for the continuous development of the women's movement.

If we consider that some women's organizations in certain countries are operating under extremely difficult conditions of repression, these achievements are even more valuable. We express our love and support here to all women who continue their unyielding struggle despite obstacles and hardships, and we call on all member organizations to unremittingly participate in the struggle against all repressive measures, participate in the defense of the democratic rights of the people of various countries, and participate in the defense of people's fundamental freedoms.

The women's movement, like an active and irresistible great force, advances vigorously and is powerful because of the unremitting, brave struggle, and loyalty of millions of women and mothers taking action around the world.

Our federation is all of them: our federation represents their pain, their hopes, and their confidence in life. That is the young mother from the Congo who, for the first time, left her country to participate in the mothers' conference with her baby on her back; the women from Transvaal who, after a grand demonstration in Pretoria, returned to their villages and found their husbands proudly welcoming them, embracing them in public for the first time in their lives; the Algerian women who, with admirable selflessness, fight side by side with men for the freedom of their people; mothers from all over the world who refuse to send their sons to war; female workers and peasants who fight for the dignity of working women; housewives who defend their families; female teachers who strive to educate children to have confidence in life; female scientists who sacrifice their health, even their lives, for human progress. Millions of women, each one of them and all of them: for centuries, they have not lived human lives, living in a state of humiliation and pain, they have realized their contribution to social life, so today they stand up all over the world against poverty, against injustice, and against war, demanding their rights, the rights of their children, and the rights of their people to freedom and peace.

Our federation, our common struggle, represents this new force. We vow to spare no effort, we call on all women's organizations to work together to make this force more widespread, more united, and more powerful; to make other millions of women realize that they must and can live a more noble life and fight for a happy life for their children; to make more and more women around the world participate in the great struggle for the victory of friendship and the victory of peace.

    关于国际民主妇联任务的总报告
    （在四月二十四日国际民主妇联理事会会议上）
    国际民主妇女联合会总书记  安吉奥拉·米涅拉亲爱的朋友们：
    自从1955年2月在日内瓦召开的理事会会议到这一次理事会会议中间相隔了一年多的时间，在这个短短的时期中进行了十分紧张的活动。
    一年半以来，除理事会以外，还举行了三次国际民主妇联执行局会议；召开了世界母亲大会以及母亲大会之前的两次国际筹备委员会会议；又成立了国际母亲常设委员会，并且举行了它的第一次会议；还扩大了一些国际活动，在这些活动中我们想特别指出庆祝国际妇女节和庆祝国际民主妇联成立十周年的活动，这两次活动的规模特别巨大。
    正像戈登夫人刚刚指出的，国际民主妇联成立十周年这个光荣的纪念日，使这次理事会具有一种庄严和特别的性质。
    十年以来，妇女运动史上已开始了一个新阶段。只要想一想妇女们在政治、经济和社会生活中所起的巨大作用，特别是在民主妇女运动已经获得更大的发展和更大势力的国家里的情况；只要想一想苏联妇女的巨大发展、欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家里妇女们面前展开的远景——这些国家的妇女已经完全平等地参加国家生活的各个方面的活动——就可以明白了。只要想一想亚洲妇女所经历的过程：像新中国妇女的生活中所发生的深刻变化，印度、印度尼西亚、日本以及其他国家里妇女运动的蓬勃发展就可以明白了。只要想一想在非洲首次出现的并且几乎在整个非洲发展着的妇女运动以及拉丁美洲各国民主妇女团体的成就就可以明白了。
    在世界各地，甚至在条件最困难的地方，在妇女从来最受压迫的国家里，巨大的妇女新生力量起来了，行动起来了。她们日益感觉到自己的责任和权利，作为一个进步、自由与和平的巨大力量，她们参与了人民的生活和国际的事务。
    国际民主妇联就在这种蓬勃的趋势中建立并发展起来。我们现在可以看到它在全世界妇女生活中所起的巨大作用。
    为了号召妇女们争取自己的权利、争取他们孩子们的幸福、争取和平而斗争，国际民主妇联根据妇女们对公平与幸福的最深切的要求，为各种族、各洲、各个社会阶层的妇女们制定了一个纲领。
    国际民主妇联不倦地努力使妇女们相信：她们的希望是可以实现的，而且只有组织起来，自己行动起来，她们的希望才能实现。
    凡是妇女支持着艰苦斗争的地方，国际民主妇联就给予支援。因此，千百万妇女都了解了西班牙、希腊、朝鲜、越南、伊朗、怯尼亚、阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆等国妇女们的痛苦和勇气。
    在国际民主妇联里，社会和政治制度不同的国家的妇女相聚在一起，因此她们得以直接互相认识，这样就使她们建立起友谊、打破障碍，并且对她们共同的斗争给予巨大的鼓励。
    国际民主妇联在它的各种活动中不懈地努力加强妇女团结，它把这一点作为使活动能够取得成就的主要条件。特别在最近一个时期，这种发展已经表现为同其他妇女力量的合作上所取得的成就，同其他妇女力量联合起来为实现整个的共同目标——解放与和平——而努力。
    在世界规模上就表现为哥本哈根代表大会根据印度代表团的建议所通过的决议的精神，即各个非国际民主妇联会员的团体和人士之间互相信任彼此合作的精神；就表现为世界母亲大会这个伟大的国际会议最近对国际民主妇联再一次表示的信任；就表现为国际母亲常设委员会的成立，这个委员会奠定了各种妇女力量同国际民主妇联之间合作的永久基础。
    国际民主妇联这样的一些成就是我们大家有理由感到自豪的。可是这些成就也带给我们一个日益重大的责任，要我们负担起满足妇女们在她们人民生活不断进展和目前形势发展情况之下所提出的要求和新任务。
    在最近一段时期内，各国国内和国际上发生了非常重大的事件，这些事件促使千百万男女的觉悟产生了深刻的变化。在由于激烈军备竞赛而受到原子弹可怕威胁和军事费用沉重负担的各国人民面前展开了一个协商与和平的巨大远景。千百万男女反对准备战争，争取缓和局势的日益加强的斗争，以共处原则作为政策依据的各国的倡议已经获得一些十分重大的成就：首先是日内瓦会议和万隆会议的召开，它们证明了一切纠纷都可以用谈判来求得解决，同时证明各国之间可以在互相尊重和合作的基础上建立起新关系。在地面上出现了一个名符其实的和平地区。拥有世界上过半数人口的国家的政府，依据印度和中国首先确定的和平共处五项原则，根据对每个国家主权的尊重并且在平等的基础上建立了它们之间的关系。
    各国人民深深相信和平是可以赢得的。对自由和进步的愿望，促使千百万男女起来粉碎殖民枷锁、争取解放。亚洲传出了非常伟大胜利的信息，那里的殖民主义遭受了严重的、不可挽回的失败；非洲也取得了非常伟大的胜利，那里的各国人民要求自由的愿望也不断取得成就。到处妇女们热烈地参加了争取独立、反对殖民主义的斗争，她们体会到殖民主义是她们祖国人民的痛苦的根本原因，是妇女和母亲们的悲惨生活的根本原因。这样，在进步与和平的道路上前进的一些国家，在进行解放斗争的时候，就为千百万妇女和儿童的公平而幸福的未来展开了伟大的远景。
    但是，争取和平的伟大战斗还没有赢得胜利，军备竞赛还在继续，侵略性条约还在分裂着世界并且使世界上某些地区保持紧张局势，本来可以给各国人民的生活带来深刻改变、会使人类获得惊人成就的原子能却被用作毁灭性武器。军事预算沉重地压在人民的肩上；本来可以用来提高千百万人民生活的无穷财富还在用来制造死亡。这里只举一个例子来说明这种罪恶行为：最近六年来，北大西洋条约大多数成员国把预算增加了两三倍；从1949年到1955年，北大西洋条约会员国耗费在军备上的款项几乎等于联合国规定用于援助落后国家的费用的九百倍。
    妇女们的良心是不能容忍这种情况的。在良心的驱使下，妇女参加争取和平实现的斗争的，数目是越来越多，也越来越团结了。
    她们越来越清楚地认识到：维护和加强和平不仅是保卫千百万人生命和地球上广大财富的主要条件，而且也是保证人类、每个家庭、每个儿童过进步和幸福生活的主要条件。
    各国会员团体的行动反映了这样一种要求。它们十分有效地支持了世界和平理事会为反对原子武器而发起的运动。世界各地，特别是在欧洲和亚洲，它们强有力地参加了反对军事条约、反对加强军备措施的全国性斗争，同时支持争取缓和国际紧张局势和争取普遍安全的倡议。
    在这些斗争的进展中，妇女团体在总的行动范围内越来越多地提出她们自己的、独特的倡议，这说明她们意识到妇女在维护和平中应起重要的决定性的作用。既然妇女占全人类的一半，她们在社会中的使命使她们担负了义不容辞的义务。这样一些符合妇女们比较特殊的感情、关怀和愿望的倡议，使她们能够接近更多的妇女，能够满足她们团结起来和行动起来的要求，能够向她们说明摆在世界人民面前的、而且往往是被故意弄模糊了以后才提在她们面前的重大问题。
    这里，我们愿意指出日本妇女，特别是全日本妇女团体联合会的领袖们值得敬佩的活动。全日本妇女团体联合会的领袖们去年向全世界妇女发出要求禁止试验原子武器的呼吁书，而且在各国组织了代表团、电影、报告会，这就帮助了千百万妇女认识到原子武器的可恨。我们愿意再提一下德国妇女们在反对巴黎协定所强行规定的复活德国军国主义的斗争中所不断采取的行动，这些行动在德意志联邦共和国境内的一个证明就是：波恩的一万二千名妇女和来自全国各地的一百七十三个代表团当议会辩论这些协定的时候，向议会表现了她们的力量。
    我们还要指出的是法兰西妇女联盟用来为争取在阿尔及利亚停火和恢复和平而行动的力量，这种力量支持着法国的母亲们强大集会所表达的成千上万个士兵的母亲反对把她们的孩子送到北非去的要求。
    缩减军费、增加和平拨款的要求，愈益有力地表现为很多国家的妇女为争取满足家庭的社会和文化需要而采取的一切行动。各国妇女在要求立即采取普遍裁军措施的同时，不仅是要求避免战争危险，而且是重申了她们获得进步与更大的幸福的权利。
    为了同一目的，各国妇女，特别是那些由于经济与商业的发展遭受限制而深受其害的落后国家的妇女，要求在平等的基础上与一切国家发展贸易来往。例如，拉丁美洲各国的妇女团体差不多全都提出了这样的要求。
    各国之间，特别是在制度不同的国家之间互换妇女代表团不断有了发展，它像一股友谊与谅解的和平巨流，强有力地援助着和平事业。这个运动中一个十分重要的新情况就是：代表团中不仅有官方团体的成员，而且有这些团体的领导人和代表，这是代表团组成情况上越来越显著的特征。在这方面，我们要特别指出，代表团在各地的访问引起了广泛人士和舆论的兴趣，以及在接待的时际各个不同团体建立起来的联系：例如，在孟买和新德里，二十九个妇女团体共同组织了欢迎宋庆龄夫人的接待。
    国际民主妇联为了表明妇女反对一切形式的备战，表明她们要求协商与和平的强有力的意志，就提出主张召开世界母亲大会，保卫她们的孩子免受战争之害，争取裁军和各国人民之间的友谊，并且以最大力量提出既然赋予生命便有神圣职责保卫生命的母亲们的责任。
    历史上初次实现了这种主张，在妇女心里引起了巨大反响；它激起了新的巨大力量，形成了一种史无前例的促成团结的推动力量。
    在这里，我们想重述一下国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟副主席阿·斯塔普勒顿夫人给大会的贺词中的话：“母亲们和祖母们的思想里是没有东方西方之分的。让我们做母亲的天性和我们大家所意识到的对于各国儿童福利的责任，构成各种不同政治思想的各国人民之间达到相互谅解的一座桥梁吧，而这种谅解将使他们之间的任何战争都成为不可能。”
    意大利天主教妇女行动联盟盟员克劳蒂尔德·加西哥里夫人在大会发言时，重申了这种相互谅解与合作的愿望。她说：“让我们出席大会的信仰天主教的母亲们团结起来会谈会谈，以便我们彼此鼓励行动起来，使我们在回到自己家里的时候更有力量地继续努力铲除人为的障碍，并且使我们毫无隔膜地去团结所有同我们自己一样真正为孩子们寻求和要求和平的妇女们……”
    印度卫生部部长考尔女士在代表大会上所作的可敬的发言中说：“我们要驱除恐惧心理，因为恐惧是人们的最险恶的敌人，是军备竞赛的主要因素，恐惧只能用爱去驱除它，只有爱才可以战胜一切。”
    这样一种宏大活动的重要意义和它对于缓和国际局势的贡献以及它所开辟的远景，可以从各种报刊上和各个彼此极不相同的国家里所得到的巨大反响，以及它在各国和国际的重要组织内部所得到的响应中得到证明。
    为了使代表大会的决议胜利贯彻并且使保证决议贯彻的团结经常化，大会通过了设立一个国际母亲常设委员会的建议，由国际民主妇联副主席安德烈·安德琳夫人担任主席。
    由三十六个国家的代表参加的常设委员会的第一次会议，标志着在争取和平的斗争中的友好合作已有进一步的发展。许多与会的知名妇女都是各国以及国际上各个不同组织的会员，而且往往是领导人，例如国际民主妇联、国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟、世界联邦同盟妇女部、西德妇女争取和平运动、美国的和平组织“拯救我们的孩子委员会”以及波兰的天主教组织“和平”等等。
    国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟副主席、母亲常设委员会委员之一菲比·库斯顿夫人说：“我们要动员人类最大的力量。这种力量如果用得恰当和适度，它就可以改变国际关系”。这样她就表达了一个贯穿在委员会每项工作中的基本精神，使得全体妇女代表——尽管她们代表着各种极不相同的经历、见解与传统——团结一致的基本精神。
    母亲常设委员会所通过的母亲宣言宣布了母亲们的根本要求：放弃以战争作为解决争端的方式；普遍裁减军备；禁止使用热核子武器并停止试验；把世界富源用来造福人类——首先是改善儿童的生活条件。
    这个文件在结论中指出：“我们要求一向被艺术家和诗人们所歌颂的母亲尊严在我们的社会上受到充分尊重，我们要求妇女们的意志和愿望在一切决定人类的现在和未来的集会中都能够得到应有的重视。”
    母亲们保卫孩子反对战争的伟大斗争应当在这些基础上在绝大多数国家里尽最大努力大力开展。宣言中所提出的要求不能不在每个母亲心中引起深刻的共鸣。每个母亲都必须知道这些要求，支持这些要求，把它们向各国政府、议会和整个舆论提出。
    委员会决定把“母亲宣言”送交将在今年秋季召开的联合国大会，并且着重指出：如果这个宣言能够得到著名人士和组织的支持，委员会就会具有更大的威信。这就是委员会向它的委员们和支持它的人士及组织提出的一个迫切任务。
    这是我们的会员团体的一个紧急任务，各会员团体应该给予委员会的委员们以最有效的支持。
    在世界母亲大会胜利闭幕之后，我们大家感到我们担负了很大的责任：使大会的要求得到支持，使它的成就得到巩固和发展。毫无疑问，各国会员团体都研究了“宣言”中所提出的问题，并且在此基础上针对母亲们最关心的问题，寻求能够带动千千万万妇女们共同行动起来的以及能够使不同的组织和运动在日益开展的为和平而合作的基础上团结起来的具体倡议。
    今天千百万男女的一致行动足以使各国政府之间取得谅解，足以使和平共处、裁减军备、协商的原则得到胜利；这里，每个人、每个组织都担负着一个日益重大的责任。
    有些组织以往把妇女生活的社会方面和教育方面的活动当作它们独一无二的任务，现在它们也已经提出了保卫和平的问题。
    许多国际组织，例如在争取和平方面具有长期的光荣传统的国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟、国际妇女合作社协会以及它们在许多国家的会员团体都已经对禁止原子武器、争取裁减军备、争取缓和局势采取了有力的立场。社会民主党妇女国际委员会在它最近一次会议中，谴责把科学发明用于破坏的目的，要求所有的政界负责人士寻求和平途径解决国际问题。在复活节，天主教会的领袖教皇庇护十二第三次表示谴责热核子武器、谴责准备毁灭性战争而盲目竞赛。
    在许多组织中，有一些代表着数百万妇女的共同行动愿望的力量发展起来了，这些力量日益感到不同的组织之间必须合作与进行讨论。
    我们应当不遗余力地去帮助一切希望保卫和平的妇女们团结起来；使妇女们和母亲们的意志以及她们的影响在国际生活中对各国政府形成日益强大的压力；使世界各地其他千百万妇女不可抗拒地被吸引到保卫和平、保卫生命的伟大斗争中来。
    生命的胜利，首先就是我们所有的孩子们的安全和他们的幸福成长。因此，世界母亲大会和国际母亲常设委员会在要求裁军的同时强有力地提出要求，要把国家财力首先用于保证儿童健康、教育、必要的保障以及以正义和和平的精神来教育他们方面。
    母亲大会向联合国表明全世界母亲热烈支持为这种崇高目的而作的努力。大会指出了要保证儿童们在物质和精神各方面的和谐发展，就必须立即行动起来并且指出了母亲们的特殊任务。儿童无力保障自己，社会应该给予保护，政府应该尽到对于他们的责任。
    许多社会和教育团体与协会吸引热心的和专业的人士展开了一些往往是规模很大的活动。像保卫儿童事业那样激动人类的感情、引起人们真挚的热诚、感人肺腑的事业是并不多的。
    1952年举行的国际保卫儿童会议在世界舆论面前严正揭露了许多国家里儿童的可悲处境。大会本着对黑种、白种和黄种儿童同样热爱的心情在告全世界男女书里写道：“今天数千万儿童——全人类最珍贵的宝贝——处在饥饿、无知、恐惧和死亡的威胁之下。”
    “在整个非洲、拉丁美洲及亚洲大部地区内，在拥有极雄厚的天然富源的国家内，有千百万儿童没有面包，没有房住，得不到照顾；他们中间半数以上不到两三岁、甚至于在还没有感觉到什么是生活的时候就死掉了。其余的儿童即使活着，也将生活在愚昧无知的状态下！世界上全人类中有半数是不识字的……”。
    现在我们可以说当时强调指出的问题已经至少得到了部分解决，儿童的处境已经有了显著的改善吗？事实每天在告诉我们：儿童的处境仍然很严重。
    各国会员团体一向善于在各个国家反映儿童们最迫切的需要，并且在地方的基础上要求设立学校、采取卫生措施、建立医疗机构、幼儿园并且在可能范围内组织他们的文娱活动。
    标志着儿童工作的发展的一个因素就是，在许多国家里，根据立法草案，向政府展开了一些全国性的运动，而为了实现这些立法草案，致力保卫儿童的个人、团体和组织都团结起来了。
    例如，为争取儿童读物与健康的教育，反对毒害儿童道德的斗争正在普遍化。在所有北欧国家、英国、澳大利亚、缅甸、美国和其他许多国家已经展开了一些运动。在1954年发行了三千万册“小人书”的瑞典，教师和学生家长都参加了行动。在哥伦比亚，教师们参加的一次运动迫使政府机关禁止出售“小人书”。
    制定了一些重要的法令草案，特别是在法国制定了学徒法令草案，在意大利制定了儿童津贴法令草案，在阿根廷和智利制定了托儿所和幼儿园法令草案。学校和受教育权利问题在意大利、以色列和印度尼西亚被有力地提了出来。南非的妇女在她们反对种族歧视的斗争中，更有力地起来反对一项限制黑种儿童上课时间的措施：“邦杜教育法案”。
    很多团体十分热诚地担负起争取那怕是暂时补救这些极端痛苦的处境的任务。面临着具有普遍而严重性质的问题，这样做是必要的；特别是当这些倡议为人民所拥护时，这样做是能得到一定效果的。例如若干团体在印度、印度尼西亚建立学校，在缅甸建立儿童机构的情况就是这样……但是必须清楚地看到只有当国家承担起儿童命运的时候，只有当获得了必需的拨款和确定出符合民族利益的政策的时候，这些问题才能真正得到永久解决。
    固然完成了这些工作，但是我们应当承认我们为保障儿童而行动的规模还不够广，而力量也不够大。我们不能说我们已经善于团结一切愿意为儿童而行动的力量，也不能说我们对于各种力量为了达到这一目的而发起的一切倡议和运动，已经予以充分注意。
    只要有一个问题还没有进入解决的途径，我们的行动就应该始终不懈，愈益有力地把它提出。公众舆论并不总是知道问题的严重性以及它的广泛性（往往是全国性的）。可以提出更多更重要的倡议来使医生、作家、教育家、母亲、父亲和各种团体把它们的保卫儿童的力量结合起来，必须通过互派代表团，互通情况、举行儿童文学或儿童绘画展览来发展国际交往，以利于所有关心儿童问题的方面彼此交流经验，以帮助各个不同国家、各个不同种族的儿童越来越彼此了解，越来越互相亲爱。
    许多集会都是为儿童而举行的，例如儿童节、母亲日等等。这些庆祝活动每每具有官方的性质，动员着千百万的男女和组织，显示出儿童的命运是目前大家都十分关心的问题。这些活动使那些愿意保卫儿童的力量有机会再一次提出它们的要求。
    “六一”国际儿童节不久就要来到了。去年的“六一”是在热烈筹备“世界母亲大会”的气氛中庆祝的。我们希望今年的 “六一”儿童节标志着我们活动中的一个新的进展，希望它成为孩子们更有力地要求生活、健康、受教育的权利并且在世界各地使大家都了解母亲们在洛桑母亲宣言中郑重宣布了的要求的机会。
    地球上有足够养活全世界儿童的财富。科学和技术的水平为和平而使用，满可以为现在和将来的儿童们创造一个幸福的世界。谁也不比妇女、母亲更愿意为实现这个愿望而献出自己全副力量。
    妇女感觉到她们在保卫她们孩子的生命的斗争中，在各国人民争取和平与自由的斗争中所起的新作用，意识到她们以自己的劳动和才能对社会进步所作的重要贡献，这种感觉和意识就使得她们越来越有力、越迫切地要求承认她们在生活各方面的充分权利。她们要求终止她们所处的不公平的受卑视情况，要求她们作为母亲、劳动者和公民的尊严受到尊重。
    妇女在社会上的地位问题是妇女运动的一个根本问题，是一切国家一切社会阶层的一切妇女都关心的问题。
    在这方面已经取得了一些决定性的成就，有力地鼓舞着全世界妇女争取平等和进步的愿望：在有些国家已经承认妇女有完全的权利并且保证了一些社会条件使得妇女们能越来越有效地享受这些权利。凡是访问过苏联、人民民主国家和中国的代表团，看到妇女在国家生活中得到的新地位、她们能够参加一切职业、受教育和深造、母亲们所得到的关怀之后，成员们都一致表示了她们的热烈情绪。我们想一想下面这件事就够了，就是：在苏联最高苏维埃现在有三百四十八位妇女，即全体当选代表的25.8％；要是我们把这个百分比同法国国民议会里3.6％、挪威议会里4％、美国国会的3.3％相比，它的意义就显得更大了。
    也可以想想中国妇女，她们朝气勃勃地参加着她们国家的社会和政治生活，地方行政职位有17.3％是由妇女担任的。
    再想想小小的阿尔巴尼亚也够了，在那里，不久以前，妇女还被剥夺了一切社会和政治权利，可是现在二千一百五十六位妇女当选为各地方人民会议的代表，有十六位妇女当选为全国人民会议的代表。
    在这十年中也实现了一些别的重要进步：有二十八个国家，妇女已经取得了选举权。许多国家在宪法里郑重承认妇女的权利。在有些国家中法律上也承认了妇女的某些权利，例如同工同酬权。不过，在世界上很大一个地区里还有很大的阻难，阻挠着妇女行使甚至已经得到的权利。她们应当从事斗争以争取法律的实施，反对法律上的种种限制，反对那些不足保证她们生活进步的经济条件和社会条件。只要贫穷、文盲、缺少社会福利设施等压得妇女在日常生活中忍受不了，我们就不可能说她们是在合理地享受她们的权利。当千百万妇女找不到工作，遭受野蛮的过度剥削，当民主自由被侵犯，保卫妇女的团体受着迫害，使妇女得到启发的刊物受到管制、有时甚至遭到禁止的时候，我们也不能说她们是在合理地享受她们的权利。在殖民地国家和落后国家中妇女的情况特别严重，在这些国家妇女在社会上和家庭中所受到的不平等和压迫是十分根深蒂固的。
    国际民主妇联早在它诞生之初，就把争取妇女权利的斗争当作民主妇女运动的头等重要任务之一。哥本哈根妇女大会大力提出在现代社会中妇女的地位问题，在“权利宣言”中，列出了所有的妇女不分种族、国籍、社会处境而应当享有的政治、公民、经济和社会权利；它号召全世界妇女紧密合作，采取坚持不懈的、有组织的行动，以赢得她们的权利。
    这样，妇女权利问题就作为一个有关正义和进步的问题，被强有力地提了出来。这个问题不仅关系着某些社会地位较高的妇女，并且关系着千百万妇女的生活，是同女工，农妇和那些受苦最深的妇女的要求紧密相联的。这些妇女所要的是一个更人道更适当的生活。这样，妇女解放斗争就成了各国人民社会生活和民主生活获得进步的一个重要因素。是他们争取自由和幸福的斗争中的一个重要因素。
    要求政治权——选举和被选举权，是妇女所要求的首要权利之一。最近，约旦、叙利亚、埃及、伊拉克、瑞士、秘鲁的妇女提出这个要求，这些国家中每一国家的不同妇女团体都表示了同样要求，有时并采取了一致行动。
    摩洛哥妇女在争取民族独立的斗争中，千千万万的人扯下了面纱，有力地要求选举权和参加一切工作。突尼斯妇联指导局宣称：“妇女们在反殖民主义示威游行中、在监狱里和在集中营里都是同她们的丈夫和儿子并肩在一起，当全国选举立宪议会时，她们将不允许男女之间存在着什么歧视。
    “戴面纱、缺少教育，都未能阻止突尼斯妇女表示：她们对作为妻子、母亲和爱国者的责任是担当得了的；她们希望不分社会地位和文化水平的差异而参加即将举行的选举，这样来继续承担这些责任……”。
    在最近若干国家的选举中使人印象深刻的是：妇女们极其积极地致力于选举运动和她们的大量参加投票。妇女团体在许多场合，自己向候选人提出包含妇女要求的纲领。在印度尼西亚、法国、芬兰、意大利等国最近都是这样。在巴西，选举共和国总统是带有争取民主和独立的性质的斗争，在这次选举中，发展了几十个妇女选举委员会，参加的有不同党派、不同团体的妇女。
    妇女团体把它们争取权利的斗争和妇女的要求，同它们国家中民主生活的发展和妇女参加政治斗争直接联系起来，是十分正确的。她们把她们的具体要求向指导国家政策的人们提出，是十分正确的。
    在意大利、巴西、智利、印度等国家中，女议员根据妇女团体的纲领和宪法上所确定的平等原则已经提出了一些重要的立法倡议。这些建议因为有千千万万妇女用行动和斗争来支持而更加声势浩大，更加有效了。
    在妇女参加政治生活的同时，她们反对种族歧视的斗争也日益壮大了。尼日利亚、塞纳加尔、刚果和南非的妇女反对用来对付有色妇女和儿童的不公平种族歧视措施的行动，表示出千千万万妇女、尤其是非洲和亚洲的妇女日益强烈的感情，同时对这些国家的人民争取尊重人权和民主权利的斗争也是一个有力的贡献。
    人民民主生活的发展鼓舞着妇女从那些在社会上甚至家庭中压迫着她们的习惯和传统下争取解放，提出要承认她们公民权利的要求。
    在我们各国会员团体中，有许多团体要求制定法律，确立妇女在婚姻方面的权利、她们的财产权和她们作为母亲的权利。例如在印度、印度尼西亚、日本、以色列，在某些问题上就是这样情况；在奥地利、法国、意大利、荷兰和德意志联邦共和国在另外一些问题上也是这样情况……这些问题往往造成一些很悲惨的情况。在世界上大多数国家里，母亲的权利遭受到不可容忍的歧视，在许多情况下，人们仍然把孩子从母亲的怀抱里夺去，既不顾她们的感情，也不顾她们的自然权利。
    因此，我们觉得更多的国家应当对这些问题更加重视，因为这些问题影响到各界妇女，并且越来越同公众的进步要求背道而驰。
    在我们的时代，没有一个国家的妇女是不参加生产的。妇女在工厂、田野、医院、学校、机关到处工作着。她们在各处，用最高技术一直到最低技术的劳动，创造着对于生活、对于社会有用的财富。
    在英国、意大利、法国、美国、德意志联邦共和国、日本，仅仅在这六个国家里，就有六千多万赚取工资的妇女劳动者。在工业极发达的国家，将近40％的劳动者是妇女。此外还有几亿农妇。
    在许多国家里，生活十分艰难，要寻找工作的妇女就越来越多了。不过，这些妇女要求工作权不仅是把它当作一个经济的需要，而且把它当作人类尊严的一个主要条件，它使妇女有发展的机会，使她们能够深入地参加到社会生活中去。妇女的劳动是一个巨大的创造力量，应当受到帮助和鼓励，使得可贵的巨大人力为祖国的发展而服务。
    不仅要在理论上承认妇女有工作权，而且要在经济和社会生活的实践中使千百万社会地位不同的妇女都能充分行使这个权利。
    为此目的，不少国家，例如印度、意大利以及阿根廷等国家的会员团体，都展开了日益壮大的争取妇女工作权利的具体行动，反对缺少工作机会，要求妇女和女青年有更多的工作机会；反对失业，反对解雇工人，特别要保障已婚妇女的职业；要求建立社会福利机构以减轻妇女的家务劳动并且保证照顾她们的孩子；要求社会承认从事种种不同类型的工作的妇女的劳动：例如，领活在家里做的劳动妇女、女佣工以及千百万农村妇女的劳动。她们的工作往往是沉重而艰苦的，却没有为社会所承认。
    此外，在许多国家里，妇女工作方面受到严重的歧视。这不仅伤害劳动妇女的尊严，而且也是贬低一般人类劳动的价值的一种现象。
    男女同工不同酬的现象是很严重的，即使在经济高度发达的国家里也是这样：男女工资在意大利和法国相差15％到20％，美国相差29％，英国在有些场合相差40％，在日本有些工作部门相差竟达60％到65％。
    妇女在工作中的提高和提升方面遇到特殊困难，而经济危机和过度剥削又特别对妇女有影响，这样就更加深了现存的歧视。只举一个例子来说明：1952年到1953年，日本的纺织业产量增加了70％，而在业的纺织女工人数却减少了40％。
    工作场所发生的事故有增无已。过度劳动经常严重地摧残女工的健康，而社会保护的立法，尤其是保障生育方面的立法是不够的。
    待遇最不公平、处境最为痛苦的就是农村妇女。在美洲、非洲和亚洲这三大洲，农村妇女在妇女中占绝大多数。她们往往是在极其艰苦的条件下劳动的：漫长而没有尽头的工作日，极其菲薄的工资，或者领实物工资或者根本领不到工资，无偿苦役，缺乏最起码的劳动工具；加以各式各样的强制束缚，社会福利和保健机构则根本没有。
    愈来愈多的劳动妇女已经不再容忍这种情况。她们提出了自己的要求，她们为实现这些要求而进行着斗争。妇女组织争取保障劳动妇女的权利和尊严的各种活动加紧了，也更加有效了。在世界各国，支持各界劳动妇女：类如女工、农妇、女教师、女公务员的生活要求的一些运动正在开展，这些运动揭发了劳动妇女的处境，提出了身为母亲的劳动妇女的问题。
    为了保卫同工同酬的原则，有些妇女组织展开了经常不断的运动。她们积极地声援要求增加工人工资的斗争，有力地支持着女工的特殊要求。争取缩小男女工资差别的斗争，已经在意大利、阿根廷、西班牙取得了重大的成就。
    国际民主妇联常常着重指出我们在农村妇女中的工作是不够的，尤其是在农村妇女构成妇女人口的大多数的那些国家。我们应当指出：近来在某些国家有了一些进步。妇女组织经常号召农村妇女参加农民斗争并且提出她们自己的要求。在妇女组织倡议之下，在意大利、古巴、巴西、阿根廷、哥斯达黎加、黎巴嫩等国采取了若干全国性的重大创举，例如农村妇女日和农村妇女会议、全国性或区域性农业女工会议和农业工人家属会议等等，在这些会议上都提出了承认工作权利、享有土地所有权和使用权、保障母亲、改善农村生活条件、保障农民家庭等问题。
    在我们会员团体发起的争取肯定妇女权利的各地全国性大规模的倡议中，特别强调了劳动妇女的权利。例如芬兰举行了争取妇女权利会议。在筹备意大利妇女第五届全国代表大会的时候，意大利妇女联盟举行了一次全民投票，征求意见书共印发了四百万份，在意见书上面列出了有关儿童津贴、学校、住所、养老金、生活程度高涨等问题，也有力地提出了妇女劳动权利和同工同酬问题，以此作为争取妇女解放斗争的主要方面。
    具体行动的开展，帮助妇女们认识到争取自己的权利和经济要求的斗争是同争取国家进步的斗争紧密联系在一起的。叙利亚、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸等国的妇女要求新的工作、要求迅速发展本国工业和技术、要求自由贸易，从而对争取和平进步和建设国家生活的行动提供了有效贡献。
    但是，我们应当指出，我们为保卫劳动权和保卫劳动者权利而采取的行动一般说来是还不够的，这种行动在某些国家中还很薄弱。在强调已经取得的成就的同时，我们特别感觉到在保卫农民妇女的行动方面是薄弱的，因为这个问题的范围却很广泛。千百万农民妇女仍然处于孤立地位，得不到援助，得不到支持和充分的了解。
    国际民主妇联热烈欢迎世界工联定于1956年6月召开一次世界女工会议。会议的日程主要有保卫工资，实行同工同酬的原则，反对一切歧视，争取改善劳动妇女的生活条件以及保卫和平等问题。
    在全世界范围内以这样的规模，向所有工会组织，向全体劳动人民、向社会舆论提出妇女工作权利的问题，在历史上这还是第一次。这是因为制止一切歧视、提出妇女劳动的价值的问题，从全体劳动人民的利益看来，从各国人民生活景况的利益看来，是迫切必需的事。
    国际民主妇联各国会员团体积极地参加了女工会议的筹备工作，努力协助保证它的成功，它们将加倍积极地在劳动妇女中间进行工作。
    在劳动妇女还没有加入工会的地方，或者在她们的要求还没有被工会组织予以足够重视的地方，妇女组织发挥作用是更为必要的。
    在任何地方，我们的任务都是要向舆论、要在劳动妇女和一般妇女中间宣传世界女工会议的宗旨，以最大力量支持劳动妇女的权利和要求，转达全体妇女对正在斗争中的劳动妇女的支持。因为妇女们认识到，劳动妇女的权利获得承认，就是在争取尊重全体妇女的地位、争取充分承认妇女在社会上的权利方面所获得的一个根本成就。
    科学以原子能的发现来为人类服务。原子能的应用将给全世界的人民带来繁荣与幸福。在地球上消灭贫困和饥饿已经指日可待了。
    但是，根据联合国正式公布的数字，现在地球上59％的人口营养不足，而在1939年的百分比还只是31％。
    在大多数国家里，医生、产院、医院、托儿所、学校、合乎卫生条件的住房的数目，都很不够。而且在某些国家中几乎就没有。救济事业常常是只依靠私人举办，依靠慈善会的活动。在三个大陆上流行着可怕的疾病，而这些疾病有时只需用最起码的治疗就能治好。
    这里的问题是根本性的重大问题，它牵涉到妇女的社会权利。这些问题要求人们予以解决，从而使千百万妇女和儿童的生活条件得到保障，得到提高。妇女团体可以大大帮助开展争取妇女的社会和文化进步的不断活动，因为她们在这些方面的每一个成就都是对整个国家生活的提高和进步的一种贡献。我们愿意强调指出这样一些很好的倡议，例如印度的保护产妇运动，印度尼西亚的增加学校和扫除文盲斗争，伊拉克最近掀起的保护母亲和儿童的运动，意大利的争取家庭妇女养老金的运动，法国、瑞典、比利时的争取家属补助金的运动，丹麦的争取单身妇女补助金的运动，加拿大的保护健康运动，法国、瑞士、荷兰和许多其他国家的推行无痛分娩运动。
    妇女对于所有这些运动都是敏于感受的，因而这些运动能够使得妇女界人士和各个团体进行广泛的合作。实现这些要求势必会影响国家的财政，因而这些团体理所当然要求政府削减军费来拨付和平事业的费用。在其他一些国家，要求的则是把这些要求列入发展国家社会经济生活范围之内，例如不久以前，印度全国妇女联合会在政府制定国家经济计划时，就提出过有关产妇方面的要求。
    在这方面，我们还想着重指出：很多团体在地方上展开社会和文化活动，来满足妇女们文化娱乐和互助的要求，从而帮助她们互相会晤，促进她们的社会生活。
    在最近时期内，军事预算的重担和外国利益集团干预国民经济的后果使许多国家人民的生活情况大为恶化。在这样的情况之下，妇女团体目前正在采取值得注意的行动来保卫家庭的生活水平。
    在英国，妇女合作协会在全国规模上发起了一个反对物价高涨的运动，这个行动受到其他团体的会员们广泛支持。这样的运动在去年一年中有了发展，并且推广到越来越多的国家，例如法国、意大利、挪威、比利时、荷兰、奥地利等。在拉丁美洲，这个运动具有特别重要的意义：民主妇女团体几乎在整个拉丁美洲起着主要的作用。
    工人们的妻子都积极地参加了争取增加工资、反对解雇的斗争，以便保卫她们孩子们的面包。她们在争取这些斗争的胜利方面往往起着决定性的作用。妇女们支持工人的经济要求，这样的国家为数很多。我们只想指出：其中的某些国家，工人们的妻子展开了真正的声援运动，这种运动把许多妇女团结起来进行斗争，并且往往逐渐经常化而且具有重要的活动纲领。
    我们愿意着重提出要求，要求在各地进行更大的努力来支持这些运动，来发展对男女工人的声援，使全体妇女对于他们的斗争给以物质上和精神上的全力支持，因为他们的斗争对于保卫人民生活水平是非常重要的。
    争取实现迫切要求和保卫家庭的斗争，是同千百万个家庭的情况的恶化、不断的恶化往往是悲惨的恶化相关联的。应该保卫的妇女是受影响最深、而且常常是最孤立的妇女们。我们应该善于同她们细谈，讨论她们的问题，向她们建议解决办法，使她们有信心，引导她们行动起来。凡是有妇女和儿童需要支援的地方，我们就应该到那里去并且在那里积极活动。
    当妇女们要求权利平等的时候，当她们要求采取社会和文化措施以提高她们的生活水平的时候，当她们保卫她们家庭的时候，她们就是在要求进步和公正这一根本要求的名义下进行斗争的。
    为了把这种要求说得更明白，更肯定，我们应该进行一种更经常更深刻的解释和教育工作，来展开关于妇女地位问题的讨论，帮助妇女对自己更有认识，并且促使舆论讨论这个问题。我们愿意提请你们注意：必须更好地研究妇女报刊在这方面可能提供的帮助。必须发挥、比以往更为努力地发挥妇女的能力，发挥她们对进步和人民斗争的贡献，发挥她们在社会上的作用。
    争取妇女权利的斗争在妇女运动中有深厚的传统；近百年来，争取妇女解放的英勇先锋们一直在进行着这种斗争，许多团体早就把这项要求载入它们的纲领，并且采取行动来争取实现。
    在一些对于这个问题一贯有着自己的立场的团体里，例如意大利的天主教团体，妇女们日益增长的愿望有了进展，民主运动中的行动也有了进展。这些团体对于某些问题已经表明了立场，虽然在表明立场以后并没有一贯地继之以有效的行动，可是这些立场是朝向进步方向的，是赞成妇女平等的，是赞成提高妇女生活的。
    妇女根本权利已经规定在联合国宪章的原则里，而妇女地位问题现在正在联合国几个机构中、在各国议会里、在许多工会中以及在很大一部分报刊上进行着讨论。
    由于妇女的活动已经取得的成就，由于苏联、中国和人民民主国家在进步道路上所获得的具有历史意义的胜利，全世界的妇女更加认识到必须而且可能彻底改变她们生活条件。必须把这种认识体现为强大的有组织斗争和实际行动的运动。必须不断提高这种认识。必须使得争取妇女权利的斗争——争取实现这种对于妇女运动来说理所当然和对于各国人民的进步来说非常重要的理想的斗争更为强大、更为经常，使它成为民主组织生活中足以把许多妇女团结起来成为文明与和平的日益强大的力量的根本斗争。
    亲爱的朋友们，国际民主妇联和各国会员团体一向关心满足妇女们的日益增长的希望，一向关心满足千百万正在觉醒的妇女们的希望，满足她们要求相互接触、相互了解和共同行动的日益增长的意愿。前面所说的一切表现了我们的这种关心，关于这一点，我们就研究到这里为止。
    妇女民主运动就这样在世界各地壮大了。我们可以引用一些数字来看看这种进展的规模：国际民主妇联同七十四个国家的妇女团体保持着经常的联系，并且同另外十三个国家的妇女组织或者个人经常有往来。
    在亚洲和非洲，例如印度尼西亚、印度、日本、尼日利亚、南非，具有群众性质的新的妇女组织的迅速发展是特别惊人的。在非洲各国，例如刚果、苏丹、塞内加尔、象牙海岸等等，妇女正在组织起来并且愈来愈多地参与国际性的行动。最近，喀麦隆民主妇女联盟和锡兰自由党妇女组织已经申请加入国际民主妇联。
    对整个国际运动具有重大意义的一个事实，就是美国妇女参加争取和平、争取美国国内民主自由的各种组织的人数日益增加以及我们和这些组织的代表人物之间的关系有了发展。在世界母亲大会和国际母亲常设委员会最近举行的会议中，一个重要方面就是：美国知名人士的发言和贺词表达了美国妇女的团结与和平愿望。
    1955到1956年之间一共举行了五十三次代表大会与各国会议，这证明了各团体活动的频繁和规模的壮大。
    妇女报刊方面的进展也说明了妇女运动的加强。在四十多个国家内发行了九十六种民主妇女报刊，其中有八种是去年创刊的。有几种是在哥伦比亚、印度尼西亚、苏丹等国创刊的，而这些国家以前从来没有过民主妇女的刊物。
    国际民主妇联十周年纪念的庆祝，表明了我们联合会在世界
  各地日益增长的声望。今年国际妇女节的庆祝具有特别浩大的声势，庆祝会举行的次数很多，庆祝的方式也多种多样。这就再一次说明了在那些参与保卫妇女权利和保卫和平的不同类型的妇女和团体之间可能实现怎样广泛的团结。（在埃及，第一次庆祝了这个十周年纪念。）
    为了适应运动的迅速高涨，为了适应妇女所提出的多种多样的强烈要求，为了适应不断增长的团结的可能性，妇女运动就寻找着组织、领导和行动的新形式。
    不同的国家在这方面有一些很有意义的经验。例如在印度和日本，有些团体在组织机构上是联合性质的，从而把为数很多的不同种类的区域性或者地方性协会团结起来。这些团体提出，有必要在各国发展使各种协会组织在一起的全国范围的活动，加强这些活动的联合性领导作用，并且加强这些活动之间的联系。法国妇联成立了一些全国性的委员会，有的是争取和平的全国委员会，有的是争取妇女权利的全国委员会，还有争取社会和文化活动的全国委员会等等。不是它们的会员、但是对它们的纲领中规定的几点感到兴趣的人士都可以参加。意大利妇联努力把地方性的委员会和小组变成真正的妇女活动场所，当地所有的妇女都可以依据社会、文化、和生活要求的活动纲领而参加。
    我们的会员团体中有些团体协助成立了形式极其多种多样的委员会；在这些委员会中，不同的妇女团体聚在一起，共同合作，来实现一个共同决定的纲领。例如，在法国成立了反对德国军国主义的妇女委员会；在德意志联邦共和国、日本和以色列成立了全国母亲委员会；在巴西成立了一个民族解放运动妇女委员会和一个反对物价高涨的委员会。在国际方面，国际母亲常设委员会的成立也是符合妇女运动这种演进的。
    不过我们应当说，这种发展是不平衡的，并不是世界各地都有这样令人满意的发展。还有太多的国家，看来似乎可以有民主妇女运动的，可是仍然没有。那里的民主妇女团体所团结和影响的妇女还很少；特别是在某些国家中，假如我们把每个国家中妇女人口拿来相比的话。
    为了使民主妇女运动在各处，甚至在极困难的条件下，都能够符合于当前情势所开创的新可能而发展起来，为了使我们联合会所维护的观点成为所有的国家中很多妇女所珍视的观点，各会员团体应当更加紧密地同妇女群众联系起来，在她们各种要求运动中不懈地保卫她们、支持她们。我们所指的不仅是那些觉悟最高、最积极的妇女，同时也是那些正在寻找如何去行动，那些千百万面对着自己的问题和自己的困难，却往往分散着而没有进行斗争的妇女。
    我们应当时时提出更多的倡议，以更大的锐气来对待行动的可能性，引导妇女们自己行动起来，进行斗争，摒弃逆来顺受和听天由命的态度，使她们懂得她们自己和她们孩子的将来就有赖于她们自己的行动。
    我们应当用种种方法来帮助妇女：演讲，开设训练班和学校，发展团体中的讨论和民主生活，这样来提高她们的觉悟，提高她们的能力，并且加强她们对运动的发展和运动的领导所作的贡献。
    面临着妇女要越过一切分歧而互相会晤、互相了解的日益增长的愿望，各会员团体现在肩负着一个特别重要的任务；就是要以全力帮助发展妇女之间和妇女团体之间的友好、团结和合作的精神。
    这些年的经验表明：全国性和国际性的团体，虽然它们所表现的传统和思想不同，虽然它们是在不同的情况下行动的，可是它们所提出的问题却是共同的，因为这些问题都是符合所有妇女要求和平、希望她们自己和她们的孩子生活条件改善的主要愿望的。
    经验又告诉我们：在解决这样或者那样的问题方面前进的每
  一步，每一个胜利，那怕是局部的胜利，都是推动着极不相同的力量趋向于同一目标的巨大而普遍的意志所获致的成就。
    我们觉得今天在世界各处都存在着条件，促使人们在共同的行动中互相会晤，共同来解决那些最为根本的问题，促使人们的这种愿望得以实现。
    因此，各国会员团体和国际民主妇联本身都有责任要以更大的勇气，更加果敢、更具信心地朝着这个方向行动起来。我们觉得妇女团体和妇女运动的代表们应当在各个国家中或国际场合上彼此会晤，以增进彼此的了解，交流经验，比较工作，并且研究采取共同行动、至少是逐渐求得一致行动的可能性。
    妇女运动在发展中所处的新情势，合作的新的可能性，要求我们对我们工作的形式和方法深刻研究。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们要求你们根据各会员团体丰富的经验，在讨论中贡献出你们工作朝着这个方向所获致的成就，你们的计划、你们的建议和你们的批评，使得我们联合会，在各个国家中并在国际范围内，能够更好地完成它所面临的新任务。我们特别要求你们对不同团体在各个国家中和在国际范围内聚会的必要性表示意见。国际妇女团体代表的聚会的成功，在很大程度上取决于各个国家中和各个国家之间合作方面所取得的进展；这种国际聚会的成功，不可能不对世界各地的团结精神和合作精神的加强有着积极的影响；因此它就保证着和平、儿童幸福和妇女权利事业能够赢得新的重要成就。
    亲爱的朋友们，在国际民主妇联的诞生十年后的今天，我们可以很自豪地回顾一下走过的道路。我们可以欢欣地指出那些标志最近这一段时期的重要成就：新团体的成立；运动在亚洲和非洲的发展；大多数团体活动的新规模和新影响；同别的妇女力量合作上所取得的进展以及千千万万勇敢、能干和忠诚的新的妇女领导人培养成功，这些领导人在行动中取得了日益增长的经验和声望，她们是妇女运动不断发展的最可靠的保证。
    假如考虑到某些国家中的妇女团体是在遭受镇压的极端艰苦的环境下进行活动的，那就会感到这些成就具有更大的价值。我们在这里向一切不顾障碍和困苦继续进行她们的不屈不挠斗争的妇女表示我们对她们的厚爱和声援，我们要求所有的会员团体不懈地参与反对一切镇压措施，参加保卫各国人民的民主权利，参与保卫人们的根本自由。
    妇女运动像活跃的不可抗拒的巨大力量一般，不停地突飞猛进，它所以强大有力是由于在全世界采取行动的千百万妇女和千百万母亲的坚持不懈，英勇斗争和忠诚不渝。
    我们的联合会，就是她们全体：我们联合会代表着她们的痛苦、她们的希望和她们对生命力的信心。那就是刚果的一位年青母亲为了背着她的婴儿在参加母亲大会，她第一次走出了她的国家；特朗斯瓦尔的妇女在普托里亚举行盛大示威游行以后回到她们的村庄的时候，发见她们的丈夫洋洋得意地来迎接她们，有生以来第一次当众拥抱了她们；阿尔及利亚妇女以令人敬佩的忘我精神同男人并肩争取她们本族人民的自由；世界各地的母亲们都拒绝把她们的儿子送去作战；女工和农妇为争取劳动妇女的尊严而斗争；家庭妇女保卫着她们的家庭；女教师们努力教育儿童要对生活有信心；女科学工作者为了人类的进步而牺牲她们的健康，甚至牺牲生命。千百万妇女，她们中间每一个人以及她们全体：在几世纪中都没有过过人的生活，处于卑贱的痛苦的境地，她们已经意识到她们对社会生活的贡献，所以她们今天在世界各地起来反对穷困、反对不公平并且反对战争，要求她们的权利，她们的孩子们的权利和她们人民获得自由与和平的权利。
    我们的联合会，我们的共同斗争，正是代表着这种新的力量。我们誓将不惜一切努力，我们号召所有的妇女团体共同工作，使这种力量越来越广泛、越来越团结、越来越有力；使其他的千百万妇女认识到必须而且可能过更加高贵的生活和为她们的孩子们争取幸福生活；使世界各地越来越多的妇女参加争取友谊胜利、和平胜利的伟大斗争。
