To support spring ploughing production, Hebei Province's Handicraft Cooperative has established more than 200 central repair stations, more than 1,000 district stations, and more than 2,000 mobile repair teams to repair and recondition old and new farm tools for farmers. On average, each township in the province has two or three repair personnel, making it very convenient for farmers to repair farm tools. Before spring ploughing, the repair personnel of the Qian'an and other county Handicraft Cooperatives carried tools and raw materials, crossing mountains and ridges to repair farm tools in mountainous areas. In Nangong and other places, many members of the Handicraft Cooperative have achieved "good quality and good attitude" when repairing farm tools.

    及时修配春耕农具
    为了支援春耕生产，河北省手工业合作社建立了二百多个中心修配站、一千多个区分站和两千多个流动修配组，为农民修配新旧农具。全省平均每个乡有两三名修配人员，农民修配农具非常方便。迁安等县手工业合作社的修配人员在春耕以前，就挑着工具、原料，翻山越岭到山区去修配农具。南宫等地许多手工业合作社的社员在修配农具的时候作到了“质量好，态度好”。
