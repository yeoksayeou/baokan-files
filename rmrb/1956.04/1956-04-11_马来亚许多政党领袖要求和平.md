Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 9th: Newspapers report that many political party leaders and political figures in Malaya have recently made statements, believing that the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, should not reject the proposal made by the Malayan Communist Party regarding the resumption of peace talks to end the Malayan Emergency.

	The Chairman of the Malayan People's Party, Boestamam, issued a written statement on April 4th demanding that Rahman accept the Malayan Communist Party's proposal. He also advocated that all opposition parties should be invited to send representatives to participate in future peace talks.

	The Secretary-General of the People's Progressive Party, Seenivasagam, said that Rahman's decision was hasty and unwise. Rahman must understand that he cannot expect to eradicate communism as a political ideal in the Federation of Malaya; he must realistically recognize that he does not have the power to succeed in something that even Britain has failed to do.

	The Chairman of the Singapore People's Action Party, Toh Chin Chye, believes that any method that can end the Emergency should be utilized.

	Tunku Abdullah, a cousin of the Sultan of Johor, said that Rahman should not reject the Malayan Communist Party's proposal to end the Emergency. He said that ending the Emergency is a matter of concern to all the people. The people of the Federation of Malaya should be made aware of all the facts related to the negotiations so that they can decide for themselves whether to accept or reject the Malayan Communist Party's proposal.

    马来亚许多政党领袖要求和平
    新华社9日讯　新加坡消息：据报纸报道，马来亚许多政党领袖和政界人士最近发表谈话，认为马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼不应该拒绝马来亚共产党提出关于恢复和平谈判以结束马来亚战争的建议。
    马来亚人民党主席波伊斯塔曼四月四日发表书面谈话要求拉赫曼接受马来亚共产党的建议。他并且主张在将来的和平谈判中，应该邀请各在野政党派代表参加。
    人民进步党总书记薛尼华沙甘说，拉赫曼的决定是急促的和不智的。拉赫曼必须了解，他绝不能指望在马来亚联合邦扑灭作为一种政治理想的共产主义；他必须现实地认清，他没有力量做成功甚至连英国都已经失败的事情。
    新加坡人民行动党主席杜进才认为，任何可以使紧急状态结束的办法，都应该加以利用。
    柔佛州苏丹的堂兄阿卜杜拉说，拉赫曼不应该拒绝马来亚共产党提出的结束紧急状态的建议。他说，结束紧急状态是全体人民都关怀的事。应该让马来亚联合邦人民了解有关谈判的全部事实，让他们自己决定接受或者拒绝马来亚共产党的建议。
