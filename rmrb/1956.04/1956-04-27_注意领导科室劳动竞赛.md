After many construction enterprises in Shanxi Province launched the advanced producer movement, old quotas were broken, and new problems such as insufficient raw material supply and poor coordination followed. Some units failed to solve these problems in time, leaving weak links unaddressed for a long time. The Taiyuan Engineering Bureau's Second Engineering Department’s plan only had overall requirements without detailed plans for specific projects. The plumbing and electrical engineering contracted in February was not assigned to anyone. The Taiyuan No. 1 Construction Company needed more than 150,000 tons of steel bars, but only 23,000 tons could be supplied. This company needed 4,287 people in the first quarter, but only had 2,898 people by March 28. This shows that the work of administrative departments is far behind the needs of production. Many employees and engineering technicians in these units want to change this backward situation in the advanced producer movement and advocate carrying out various professional competitions. However, because the trade union organizations in these units do not pay attention to leading labor competitions in administrative departments, professional competitions in administrative departments have become a mere formality, with little effect.

To improve the work of administrative departments so that it can keep up with the needs of production development, it is necessary to strengthen the trade union's leadership of labor competitions in administrative departments.

    注意领导科室劳动竞赛
    山西省许多建筑企业在开展先进生产者运动以后，旧定额被打破了，接着就出现原材料供应不够，协作配合的不好等新问题。有的单位没及时给以解决，使薄弱环节长期没能克服。太原工程局第二工程处的计划只有总要求，没有分部分项工程计划，二月份承包的水暖电工程没确定由谁来完成。太原市第一工程公司需要十五万多吨钢筋，而实际只能供应二万三千吨。这个公司第一季度需4，287人，而到三月二十八日只有2，898人。这说明科室工作大大落后于生产的需要。这些单位的许多职员、工程技术人员，都想在先进生产者运动中改变这种落后状况，倡议开展各种同业务竞赛。但是由于这些单位的工会组织不注意领导科室的劳动竞赛，科室的同业务竞赛都流于形式，效果不大。
    要改进科室工作，使它能赶上生产发展的需要，就要加强工会对科室劳动竞赛的领导。
