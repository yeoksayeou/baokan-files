Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: According to a France-Presse report on the 1st, the fervent sentiment in the Philippine Congress to re-examine Philippine-US relations continues to grow. Leaders of the House of Representatives have suggested establishing a joint committee composed of executive and legislative branches to study Philippine relations with the United States, which are "currently in a state of tension."

The report said that the committee will raise the issue of the US State Department's interference in the negotiations between the Philippines and Japan regarding war reparations. The report revealed that the US State Department had put pressure on the Philippines, telling it not to "demand too much from Japan."

According to a France-Presse report the day before, the "increasingly strong anti-American sentiment" in the Philippines has caused Philippine President Magsaysay to demand that the US government "take immediate action" on some issues on March 30th. The report said that Magsaysay had telegraphed the Philippine Ambassador to the United States, Romulo, instructing him to "raise appropriate opinions" to the United States on three issues. These three issues are: the issue of US discrimination against Filipino workers in Guam, which has recently caused public outrage and protests in the Philippines; the issue of US discrimination against the Philippines regarding the import of Philippine sugar; and the issue of US interference in the mining activities of Filipinos in the Clark Air Base area.

    菲律宾反美情绪继续增长
    新华社2日讯　据法新社1日报道，菲律宾国会要求重新审查菲美关系的激动情绪仍在增长中。众议院领袖们建议成立一个由行政机构和立法机构组成的联合委员会，来研究“目前处于紧张状态”的菲律宾同美国的关系。
    消息说，这个委员会将提出美国国务院对于菲律宾和日本的关于战争赔偿问题的谈判进行干涉的事情。消息透露，美国国务院曾经向菲律宾施加压力，叫它不要“向日本要求太多”。
    据法新社在这前一天报道，菲律宾“日益高涨的强烈的反美情绪”已经使菲律宾总统麦格赛赛在三月三十日要求美国政府对一些问题“立刻采取行动”。消息说，麦格赛赛已经打电报给菲律宾驻美国大使罗慕洛，要他就三个问题向美国“提出适当的意见”。这三个问题是：最近引起菲律宾公众愤慨抗议的美国歧视关岛的菲律宾劳工问题，美国在关于输入菲律宾糖问题上歧视菲律宾问题，以及美国干涉菲律宾人在克拉克军事基地地区开矿问题。
