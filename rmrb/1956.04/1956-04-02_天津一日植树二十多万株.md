    绿化我们伟大的祖国
    天津一日植树二十多万株
    天津市一万四千多名青少年在四月一日——第一个全国植树造林日，冒着雨雪栽种树苗二十多万株。
      “广州——满洲里万里铁路共青团林荫大道”从北仓到山海关沿线三百五十多公里的植树任务，是由青年铁路职工和沿线的青年农民担任的。今天有九千多名青年在茶淀到胥各庄的铁路两旁栽种了八万八千多株树苗。今天上午，有一千五百多名少年组成的造林大队出现在天津市历史博物馆的空地上。天津市市长黄火青也参加了这个造林队的植树活动。他们在两小时内就栽种了三千多棵紫穗槐。更多的青年工人、农民和学生，今天在约二十华里长的新开河和金钟河沿岸栽种了近十万棵乔木树。
