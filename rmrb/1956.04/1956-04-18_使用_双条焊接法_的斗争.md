The Struggle to Use the "Double-Electrode Welding Method"
	Zhou Lin

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project is being constructed using the world's most advanced "caisson drilling method." Adopting this method requires the manufacture of large concrete caissons. Electric welder Guan Yeliang and his partners undertook the task of the first process in manufacturing large caissons: welding.

These large caissons are nine meters long each, and as thick as a large round table top. One train car can only carry one caisson. The workers in Guan Yeliang's group were somewhat surprised when they heard that forty to fifty thick steel bars had to be welded one by one onto the 1.55-meter diameter large flange plates (hollow large iron disks) at both ends of the caissons: "What big fellows!"

The manufacturing work encountered difficulties from the very beginning. Some of the steel bars welded to the flange plates were crooked, and some were bent, and they could not be straightened no matter what. After several days of painstaking research, Guan Yeliang finally came up with a way to overcome the difficulties, so that the welded caissons fully met the specifications. In this way, the first caisson was manufactured. The underwater pier project of the Yangtze River Bridge also started ahead of schedule.

The construction site needed three or four caissons every day, but they could only weld a little over one caisson per day. Guan Yeliang tried to break some of the "rules and regulations" on the construction site, extending the operating time of the welding machines from fourteen hours to twenty-four hours per day, and also trained seven young workers who could weld in just over twenty days. Even so, the production of caissons still could not meet the needs of the construction site. Electric welding work remained a weak link.

Just as this was very difficult, Gao Shangwu, the production instructor of the trade union, came to Guan Yeliang at the site. Guan Yeliang knew that Gao Shangwu had done welding work before, and was planning to ask him for advice, but who knew Gao Shangwu asked, "Have you joined the Party yet?" Guan Yeliang nodded. Gao Shangwu then grabbed Guan Yeliang's hand and said, "Comrade, everyone knows that your welding team has difficulties, but for us Communists, we must create conditions to overcome difficulties in the face of all difficulties." Guan Yeliang was very excited. He thought, "Yes, I, a Communist, should come up with more solutions!"

He thought of the "double-electrode welding method." This is an advanced Soviet experience. In the past, welding was done one by one. With the double-electrode welding method, two can be welded at the same time, and the work efficiency is naturally higher than the old method. He had seen others use it before he came to the Yangtze River Bridge construction site, but he had tried it many times without success. This time, he was determined to learn this advanced method. He bought a book introducing this method. His education level was low, and he could not fully understand it, so he studied it carefully word by word, reading a sentence, thinking about the principles inside, and then analyzing the reasons for past failures. Sometimes he would read the book and rush to the site to experiment. If it was not successful, he would turn back to the book to study. After several days and nights of study and experimentation, he finally learned this advanced method.

Guan Yeliang knew that in order to increase production, all comrades in the group must master this advanced experience. One night, he deliberately competed with Yu Changbang, a young worker in the group, to see who could weld faster. Yu Changbang was recognized by everyone as a fast worker, but this time he fell behind Guan Yeliang. Yu Changbang was very surprised and asked, "How are you so fast?" Guan Yeliang then explained that he was using the "double-electrode welding method" and told him the key points of operation. In this way, the two of them continued to work for three nights. At the beginning, Guan Yeliang welded quickly, reaching one caisson every eight hours (the old method was fourteen hours). After two days, Yu Changbang caught up, and could weld one caisson in only seven hours.

Guan Yeliang also publicized this among the welders and demonstrated the operation to everyone. But the people who watched were not interested. Some said, "It's pretty good, but I haven't used it." Some said, "Our hands and feet are slow, this thing might not work, right?" No one asked to learn this advanced method. One day, he gathered all the workers in the group again to discuss how to ensure the completion of the task of welding four caissons every day. The meeting lasted for a long time, and no one said that they wanted to change the operating method. At this time, Yu Changbang told everyone about his experience of learning the "double-electrode welding method" and firmly said, "To increase production, we can only master this advanced experience." Yu Changbang's personal experience enlightened everyone, and many people automatically asked Guan Yeliang to learn.

The "double-electrode welding method" was widely learned in the group, and the daily output increased from two caissons in the past to four caissons, then to five caissons, and the highest reached seven caissons, all with good quality.

The trade union asked the First Bridge Team to reward Guan Yeliang's group. Chief Engineer Chen Changyan asked Engineer Li Jiajun of the Foundation Detachment and Director Li Zhongyi of the Welding Workshop to make a technical appraisal. These two people took a stroll on the site and made the "appraisal." They believed that the double-electrode welding method had four major shortcomings: the welding machine was overloaded and the equipment was easily damaged; the current was uneven and the quality of the weldment was poor; the current was too large and the welding rod was wasted; and the sparks increased and accidents were prone to occur. Chief Engineer Chen ordered to immediately stop using the double-electrode welding method.

Chief Engineer Chen's order startled Guan Yeliang: this method had been used for half a year, the welding machine had not been overloaded, the quality of the caisson was good, the welding rod was saved, and no accidents had occurred, how did these "four major shortcomings" come about? He went to talk to the Foundation Detachment Leader and the Party Branch Secretary. They only asked him whether he could guarantee the quality of the weldment, and did not clearly express their attitude. Then, someone came to the site to execute Chief Engineer Chen's order, believing that Guan Yeliang's use of the double-electrode welding method was a violation of technical operating procedures.

Guan Yeliang remembered the education he received in the Party member training class: "Anything that is beneficial to the Party and the people must be persevered to the end." He was determined to fight resolutely for the implementation of this advanced experience.

One day, in the very crowded construction site dining hall, Guan Yeliang happened to eat at the same table with Chief Engineer Chen. They talked while eating:

"We have been using the double-electrode welding method for more than half a year, why are we not allowed to use it again?"

"I'm afraid it will overload and the motor can't handle it!"

"Nothing has happened for several months, why are you saying it can't handle it now?"

"Oh, oh! What else is there to say, aren't you not using it?"

"Didn't you order to stop using it?"

"The motor doesn't speak, who can know if it's overloaded?"

"How can you not know? If someone carries a bag of rice up Turtle Mountain, you can tell whether he can carry it or not. Whether the motor is overloaded or not, although it doesn't speak, you can also measure its temperature."

Guan Yeliang answered many technical questions raised by Chief Engineer Chen. Chief Engineer Chen finally had to say, "Your words make some sense, but we still need to study it."

A few days later, an engineer surnamed Yang came to the site to "study." He did not talk about the problem of the welding machine being unable to handle it, but criticized the poor quality of the caisson welding, the insufficient tensile force, and the failure to reach the safety factor, and asked the workers in the group to rework the welded caissons. Guan Yeliang asked, "What safety factor should be reached?"

"Seven times," Engineer Yang blurted out.

"Why is it so big?"

"Five times."

"I'm afraid it doesn't need to be that big, right?"

"Three times is also fine."

Even Engineer Yang himself did not figure out what safety factor should be reached, he asked the workers to rework the welded caissons. Guan Yeliang argued with Engineer Yang for a long time, and Engineer Yang finally understood: "The tensile test should reach four tons."

The tensile test started immediately. In order to prove that the quality of each worker's operation was qualified, Guan Yeliang did not do it himself, but let his apprentice weld two steel plates together with double-electrode welding as a test material. The result of the test was that the steel material was pulled off at nine tons, and the fracture was not at the welding place. This proved that the quality of the workpieces welded by the "double-electrode welding method" was very good.

The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China knew about this matter. Under the urging of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, the Political Department of the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau began to intervene in this matter. The "double-electrode welding method" was officially approved for use more than half a year after it was implemented. The workers resolutely implemented this method, which enabled them to complete the manufacturing task of the caissons ahead of schedule in December of last year, creating conditions for the simultaneous construction of eight pier projects in January of this year.

    使用“双条焊接法”的斗争
    周林
    武汉长江大桥工程是用全世界最新的“管柱钻孔法”施工的。采用这个方法，就需要制造大型混凝土管柱。电焊工管叶良和他的伙伴们便承担了制造大型管柱的第一道工序——电焊工作的任务。
    这种大型管柱每节有九公尺长，有大圆桌桌面那么粗，一辆火车只能载一节。管叶良领导的小组的工人们，听到要把四五十根粗大的钢筋，一根根地焊接在管柱两头的直径1.55公尺的大法蓝盘（空心大铁圆盘）上的时候，都有些吃惊：“好大的家伙呀！”
    制造工作一开始就遇到困难。焊到法蓝盘上去的钢筋，有的歪了，有的弯了，怎么也弄不直。经过几天的苦心钻研，管叶良终于想出办法克服了困难，使焊接的管柱完全合乎规格。这样一来，第一节管柱便制造出来了。长江大桥的水中桥墩工程也提前动工了。
    工地上每天需要三、四节管柱，而他们每天只能焊接一节多。管叶良想法打破工地上的一些“清规戒律”，把电焊机的开动时间由每天十四小时延长到二十四小时，并且在二十多天内培养出七个能够烧焊的青工。即使这样，管柱的生产也仍然不能满足工地的需要。电焊工作依然是个薄弱环节。
    正在这十分为难的时候，工会生产指导员高尚武到现场找管叶良来了。管叶良知道高尚武做过电焊活，正打算向他请教，谁知高尚武却问道：“你入党没有？”管叶良点了点头。高尚武这时一把抓住管叶良的手说：“同志，大家都知道你们电焊组有困难，但是，对我们共产党员来说，必须在万难的情况下创造出克服困难的条件来。”管叶良非常激动。他想：“对呀，我，一个共产党员，应该想出更多的办法来啊！”
    他想到了“双条焊接法”。这是苏联的先进经验。过去都是一根根地焊，用双条焊接法，可以同时两根两根地焊，工作效率自然比旧方法高。他来长江大桥工地以前就见别人用过，但自己试验许多次都没成功。这次，他决心要把这个先进方法学会。他买了一本介绍这个方法的书。他的文化程度低，不能完全看懂，便一字字地细细钻研，读一句，想一下里面的道理，再分析过去失败的原因。他有时读了书，就赶去现场试验，不成功，再翻书本研究。经过几昼夜的学习和试验，他终于学会了这个先进方法。
    管叶良知道，要提高生产，还必须全组的同志掌握这个先进经验。一天晚上，他故意同组里的一个青工余常榜比赛，看谁焊的快。余常榜是大家公认的快手，这次却落在管叶良的后面了。余常榜十分诧异，问道：“你怎么这样快？”管叶良便讲出他用的是“双条焊接法”，并且把操作要点告诉他。这样，他俩又继续干了三夜。开始，管叶良焊的快，达到了每八小时焊一节（旧方法是十四小时），过了两天，余常榜赶上去了，只要七小时就能焊一节。
    管叶良又在电焊工中进行宣传，并且操作给大家看。可是看了的人不感兴趣，有的说：“怪好的啊，就是没用过。”有的说：“我们手脚慢，这玩意儿怕不行吧？”谁也没要求学习这个先进方法。一天，他又召集全组工人开会，研究怎样保证完成每天焊接四节管柱的任务。会议开了很久，谁也没讲要改变操作方法。这时候，余常榜把自己学习“双条焊接法”的经过告诉大家，并且坚决地说：“要提高生产，就只有掌握这个先进经验。”余常榜的亲身经验启发了大家，许多人都自动向管叶良学习。
    小组里普遍学习了“双条焊接法”，每天的产量就由过去的两节提高到四节，再提高到五节，最高达到了七节，质量都很好。
    工会请一桥队奖励管叶良领导的小组。陈昌言总工程师要基础分队的李家骏工程师和电焊车间李忠义主任去作技术鉴定。这两个人在现场上溜了一趟，便把“鉴定”作出来了。他们认为双条焊接法有四大缺点：电焊机超过负荷，设备容易损坏；电流不匀，焊件质量不好；电流量过大，浪费焊条；火花增多，易出事故。陈总工程师命令立即停止使用双条焊接法。
    陈总工程师的命令使管叶良大吃一惊：这个方法已经使用了半年，电焊机并没有超过负荷，管柱质量又好，又节省焊条，又没出过事故，怎样来的“四大缺点”呢？他去找基础分队长和支部书记谈话。他们只问了问他能不能保证焊件质量，没有明确地表示态度。接着，又有人来现场执行陈总工程师的命令，认为管叶良使用双条焊接法是违犯技术操作规程。
    管叶良记住党员训练班给他的教育：“凡是对党对人民有利的事情，必须坚持到底。”他决心为实行这个先进经验坚决斗争。
    一天，在非常拥挤的工地饭堂里，管叶良碰巧和陈总工程师同桌吃饭。他们一边吃饭，一边就谈开了：
    “我们用双焊条已经半年多了，怎么又不让用呢？”
    “怕超过负荷，电机吃不消啊！”
    “几个月都没有出事情，为什么现在又说吃不消呢？”
    “唉，唉！还说什么呢，你们不在用吗？”
    “你不是下命令停止使用吗？”
    “电机不说话，谁能知道它超过负荷没有？”
    “怎么能不知道呢？如果有人扛一袋米上龟山，他扛不扛得起，是能看出来的。电机超过负荷没有，虽然它不说话，也是可以测量它的温度的。”
    陈总工程师提出的许多技术问题，管叶良都答复了。陈总工程师最后只好说：“你的话有些道理，但是还要研究研究。”
    过了几天，有个姓杨的工程师到现场“研究”来了。他不谈电焊机吃不消的问题，却批评管柱焊接的质量不好，拉力不够，达不到安全系数，要小组里的工人把焊好的管柱返工。管叶良问道：“要达到多大的安全系数？”
    “七倍，”杨工程师随口答应说。
    “怎么这样大？”
    “五倍。”
    “恐怕也不需要这样大吧？”
    “三倍也行。”
    连杨工程师本人也没弄清楚究竟该达到多大的安全系数，他就要工人将焊好的管柱返工。管叶良同杨工程师争论了很久，杨工程师最后才明白了：“拉力试验应该达到四吨。”
    拉力试验立即开始了。为了证明每个工人操作的质量都合格，管叶良自己没动手，而让他的徒弟用双焊条将两块钢板焊在一起作试料。试验的结果，拉到九吨的时候，钢料才被拉断了，并且断口还不在焊接的地方。这证明“双条焊接法”焊接的工作物的质量很好。
    中共武汉市委知道这件事情了。长江大桥工程局政治部在武汉市委督促下，才开始过问这件事情。“双条焊接法”也在实行半年多以后，才被正式批准使用。工人们坚决实行这个方法，才能在去年十二月全部提前完成管柱的制造任务，给今年一月八个桥墩工程同时施工创造了条件。（附图片）
