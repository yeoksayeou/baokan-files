    Friend of the Tibetan People
    Captain Li Gangfu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Several years ago, when the advancing troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army first set foot on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the soldiers often stood on the peaks of the snow mountains, gazing at the green fields, the grasslands dotted with cattle and sheep, and the rivers surging with silver waves, marveling at how magnificent and beautiful our motherland was. However, for many years, the people on this land of more than 1.2 million square kilometers had been tormented by profound disasters and poverty, struggling in pain and hunger year after year. The Tibetan people longed for reliable relatives to help them. Long before the People's Liberation Army marched into the plateau, the Tibetan people sang their hopes like this: "When will the dark clouds spit out the red sun? When will plum blossoms bloom on the snow mountains? When will our suffering end?" In the past few years, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have strictly observed the ethnic policies and won the trust of the Tibetan people with their practical actions: "The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army can relieve our pain and disaster."
    In the summer of 1951, Halibek bandits, who had fled from Xinjiang to northwestern Ali, stole thirty sheep and his home—a tent—from the elderly Rejia Mu of the Gaize District. He angrily shouldered his hunting rifle, determined to fight the bandits to the death and take back his property. Just at this moment, he saw a neat line of men and horses coming down from the snow mountain, and then used powerful artillery fire to eliminate the bandits. He really wanted to risk asking this group of people for his property back, but the painful experience of history made him afraid. He gritted his teeth, glaring at this group of men and horses: "These are also outsiders! Outsiders are all evil eagles, born to eat the flesh of Tibetans and drink the blood of Tibetans!" He lamented: "It's over, my life! My property can never be recovered!"
    From then on, the old man began his life of hunting and begging.
    Two months later, the Halibek bandits in northern Tibet were wiped out, and at a mass meeting, the People's Liberation Army took the initiative to return all 14,000 cattle and sheep and other赃物 seized from the bandits to the local people. Rejia Mu was puzzled as to why this army cared for them so much. As he was about to leave with his sheep and tent, a soldier holding a lamb suddenly grabbed him and said kindly:
    "Old man, this lamb is also yours!"
    "No, no!" The old man honestly denied: "I only had thirty sheep, and I've found them all!"
    "It's yours, old man, it's the lamb born to the big old ewe. Look, I even made a mark on it!"
    Rejia Mu took the lamb from the soldier's arms and held it tightly. The lamb happily called out to its owner, and the old man's tears dripped onto the lamb's white fleece. How grateful this old man was to the People's Liberation Army! He didn't say anything else. He immediately entrusted the sheep and tent to another herdsman, and he carried his hunting rifle, crossed mountains, braved the plateau cold wind, and traveled to various pastoral areas in northern Tibet. Wherever he went, whomever he met, he would proclaim: "The saviors of us Tibetans have come to Gaize District!"
    This incident happened in the westernmost part of the plateau. Two thousand kilometers east of here is the central part of the plateau. Here, on the Kangzang Highway, there is a wooden bridge. There is a sign on the bridgehead that says "Lifesaving Bridge." The rapid stream under the bridge is called Lengqu, a tributary of the Nujiang River. This "Lifesaving Bridge" has a history. Before the Kangzang Highway was open to traffic, a unit lived on the flat land on the east bank of the river. Every day, the children would cross the river to play and learn to sing "The East is Red." But at that time there was only a single wooden bridge, rotten and unstable, and people would fall into the river if they lost their footing. One evening, after working, the soldiers were sitting on the flat ground washing their feet and drinking tea when suddenly a sharp cry came from the bridgehead: "Help! Luo Renque Pi fell into the water..." The soldiers knew that Luo Renque Pi was a shepherd boy less than ten years old, who usually wore a tattered sheepskin coat, his face as red as a ripe mountain peach, and his eyes were black and bright. The soldiers didn't bother to put on their shoes and ran towards the river. Li Tianshen, the clerk of a certain company, ran fast and jumped into the water without taking off his clothes. The river water on the plateau in October was piercingly cold, the current in the center of the river was very rapid, and there were many pebbles, making it difficult to walk without stumbling. He didn't catch the child...the child was swept away. The waves threw Li Tianshen onto a large rock, and he was in pain, cold, and anxious. He grabbed the rock, stood up, and looked around. But the child had already been washed out of sight. He climbed ashore and ran forward along the riverbank, and everyone followed him. When people arrived at a calm river bend, Li Tianshen was dragging the child ashore from the deep water. Before he could drag him to shallow water, he collapsed due to exhaustion. Everyone immediately jumped into the water and rescued him and the child.
    In 1953, when the Kangzang Highway was built to the Lengqu River, the company Li Tianshen belonged to built a large wooden bridge over the river. The local people requested the People's Liberation Army to name the new bridge "Lifesaving Bridge." They said: "Let the people who pass by, let our descendants, know how the People's Liberation Army loves and helps us, and how kind a thing they have done here!"
    In a small town on the southeastern border of Tibet, the following happened: At dawn, the subtropical night fog gradually dissipated, and the local Tibetan people began their morning prayer as usual. Their morning prayer was very special: they prayed in the direction of the People's Liberation Army barracks flying the five-star red flag; their scripture was: "God! May my highland barley grow strong, and may people and livestock prosper. We beseech you, my Almighty God, to protect the longevity of the Commander, and to protect the health of the Commander!"
    They prayed like this because they had encountered the following: There was a major earthquake in the area a few years ago, and the lifeline of the people—a several-kilometer-long canal—was destroyed, and three to four hundred mu of paddy fields were deserted. For several years, the fields had no water and could not be planted with seedlings. People were often worried. In 1951, a People's Liberation Army unit was stationed here. Before they could shake off the dust, they worked day and night to help the Tibetan people restore production and repair the canal. When the clear mountain water flowed along the wide and solid canal to the fields, people played the reed pipe and sang and danced, and the old mothers stuffed fruit into the soldiers' hands. People looked at the long canal and said: "Great Army! This is not mountain water, it is your blood and sweat, it not only flows into the paddy fields, but also flows into our hearts!"

    藏族人民的朋友
    中国人民解放军上尉　李刚夫
    几年以前，中国人民解放军进藏部队刚刚踏上康藏高原的时候，战士们常常站在雪山之巅，眺望着那绿油油的田庄，那蠕动着牛羊的草原，那激腾着银花的河流，惊叹着我们的祖国是多么雄伟美丽。但是，多少年来，这块有着一百二十多万平方公里的土地上的人民，就一直被深重的灾难和贫困折磨着，终年挣扎在病痛和饥饿中。藏族人民渴望有可靠的亲人来帮助他们。远在解放军进军高原之前，藏族人民就这样唱着自己的希望：“何日乌云吐红日？何日雪山梅花开？我们的苦难那天尽？”几年来，人民解放军的战士们严格地遵守民族政策，以实际行动博得了藏族人民的信任：“共产党、解放军可以解除我们的痛苦和灾难”。
    1951年的夏天，由新疆窜到阿里西北部的哈力拜克匪徒，把改则区的惹加牟老人的三十只羊和他的家——一架帐篷抢走了。他愤怒地背起猎枪，决心和匪徒们死战，夺回自己的财产。恰在这个时候，他看见从雪山上下来一支整齐的人马，接着用强大的炮火，消灭了匪徒们。他真想冒险跟这群人要回自己的财产，可是，历史的惨痛经验使他害怕了。他咬着牙，瞪着这群人马：“这也是外来的人！外来的人都是恶鹰，生来就吃藏民的肉，喝藏民的血的！”他哀叹道：“完啦，我的生命呵！我的财产再也夺不回来了！”
    从此，这位老人开始了他的狩猎乞讨的生活。
    两个月以后，藏北的哈力拜克匪徒被消灭干净了，解放军在一个群众大会上，把所有从匪徒手里缴获来的一万四千头牛羊和其他的赃物，主动送还给当地人民。惹加牟老人一点也不明白这支军队为甚么这样爱护他们。当他领到自己的羊只和帐篷正要走的时候，一个抱着羊羔的战士，忽然一把拉住他，和气地说：
    “老人家，这只小羊也是你的！”
    “不是，不是！”老人诚实地否认：“我只有三十只羊，全找到了！”
    “是你的，老人家，是大个子老绵羊生的羔儿。你看，我还打了记号呢！”
    惹加牟老人从战士的怀里接过那只小羊，紧紧抱住它，小羊快乐地对主人叫着，老人的眼泪滴到羊羔的洁白的绒毛上。这位老人是怎样的感激解放军呵！他没有说别的话，当时就把羊和帐篷交托给另一个牧民，他背上猎枪，翻山越岭，冒着高原寒风，走遍藏北各个牧区，每到一地，每见一人，他就宣传说：“改则区来了我们藏民的救星了！”
    这件事情是发生在高原的最西部。从这里东行两千多公里，是高原的中部。在这里，在康藏公路线上，有一座木桥。桥头上有一个牌子，上面写着“救生桥”三个大字。桥下的急流叫冷曲，是怒江的支流。这座“救生桥”是有来历的。康藏公路还没有通车以前，有一支部队住在河东岸的平坝上。每天，孩子们都过河来玩耍，学唱“东方红”。可是那时候这里只有一根独木桥，烂糟糟的，人走不稳，就会掉到河里去。一天傍晚，战士们在劳动之后，正坐在平坝上洗脚，喝茶，忽然从桥头上传来一阵尖厉的喊声：“救人啊！罗仁却匹落水了……。”罗仁却匹，战士们知道那是一个不满十岁的牧羊孩子，平时穿着一件破羊皮袄，脸红得像熟透了的山桃，两只眼睛黑溜溜的。战士们顾不得穿鞋，就朝河边跑去了。某连文书李天申跑得快，顾不上脱衣服就跳到了水里。十月高原的河水冷得透骨，河中心水很急，卵石又多，走一步就跌几个跤。他没有抓住孩子……孩子冲下去了。浪把李天申摔到大石头上，他又痛、又冷、又着急，抓住石头站起来，向周围了望。可是孩子已经被冲得看不见了。他爬上岸，沿着河边往前追，大家也随着他朝前跑。当人们赶到一个水流平缓的河湾里的时候，李天申正从深水中向岸上拖着孩子。还没有拖到浅水里，因为过度疲劳，他就倒下了。大家立即跳到水里，把他和孩子一块救了出来。
    1953年，康藏公路修到冷曲河，李天申所在的连队在河上架起一座大木桥来。当地人民要求解放军把这座新桥命名为“救生桥”。他们说：让过路的人们，让我们的后代，都知道人民解放军怎样爱护和帮助我们，在这里做过一件多么善良的事情吧！”
    在西藏东南部边境上的一个小城镇里，有过这样的事情：黎明，亚热带的夜雾渐渐消失，当地的藏族人民照例开始早祷。他们的早祷是很特别的：他们向着飘扬着五星红旗的解放军兵营方向祈祷；他们的经词是：“神啊！我的青稞茁壮，人畜兴旺。祈求您，我的万能的神啊，保佑大军长在，保佑大军健康！”
    他们这样祈祷，是因为他们遇到过这样的事情：当地前几年曾经有过一次大地震，人民的生命线——一条几公里长的水渠被摧垮了，三、四百亩水田荒芜了。几年来，因为田地没有水而插不上秧苗。人们经常忧愁着。1951年，一支解放军进驻到这里。他们还没把身上的灰尘抖掉，就日夜不停地帮助藏族人民恢复生产，抢修这条水渠。当清清的山水沿着宽阔坚固的水渠流向田地的时候，人们吹起籚笙，又歌又舞，老妈妈们把水果塞到战士们的手里。人们望着漫长的渠水说：大军啊！这不是山水，是你们的血汗，它不光流到稻田里，而且也流到我们的心田里！
