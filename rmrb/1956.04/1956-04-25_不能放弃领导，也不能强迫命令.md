Cannot Abandon Leadership, Nor Resort to Coercive Orders
Wu Erxiang

Currently, in some rural areas of Guangdong Province, the following situations have emerged: Some staff members, not long ago, blindly believed that socialism had already gained an absolute advantage in the countryside and that all work would naturally proceed smoothly without any further difficulties. Therefore, they were content to sit high above, formulating plans and issuing orders, no longer engaging in arduous mass work. Now, they have taken their plans to the masses for verification, to see how much the masses have already done. The result is that they found that what they had formulated was just an empty plan. But the farming season is already very pressing. What to do? They became discouraged, and things that could have been done are now not being done; things that are difficult to do, but still possible, are also being abandoned. For example, Fengyang Township in Chao'an County originally planned to convert 20% of the paddy fields to single-seedling dense planting, but now they are not converting a single mu; the production increase plan of Fuyang Township could have been completed, but after encountering some difficulties, they lowered the plan by 5%.

Another serious situation is that some staff members, seeing the danger of plans falling through, became agitated. In order to complete the plans, they did not hesitate to resort to coercive orders. For example, the Zhanjiang Special District plans to eliminate more than one million mu of broadcast-sown fields throughout the district this year. This is originally a good thing. If broadcast sowing can be changed to transplanting or row planting, production can be increased by one or two times, and this plan is also feasible. Unfortunately, some staff members in this special district only know how to issue orders from above, and the ingrained habits of the masses cannot be changed with a single order. As a result, you issue your orders, but the masses still do things according to their own habits. What to do? The easiest way is still to issue orders. The staff stationed in the cooperative of Duande Township in Wuchuan County did just that. They saw that the masses had planted a few mu of fields using the broadcast sowing method, so they forced the masses to plow it up and replant it. The Secretary of the Lianjiang County Committee of the Communist Party ordered that all seeds in the county used for broadcast sowing be collected, saying, "You must change, even if you don't want to." He thought that doing so would make the masses abandon the broadcast sowing method, but the fact is not so. When members of the Malian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haikang County wanted to broadcast sow, the cadres forbade it and locked up the seeds. As a result, the door was broken open by the members, and the seeds were still taken away for broadcast sowing. Of the more than 600 mu of paddy fields that have already been planted in the whole township, broadcast-sown fields account for 90%. The cooperative members criticized our staff, saying, "What's the use of just shouting empty slogans? You should talk about the benefits of eliminating broadcast sowing! Don't use our stomachs as experiments."

Now it is the transplanting season, and drought has occurred in many areas of Guangdong. Ensuring that seedlings are transplanted and ensuring the implementation of large-scale technical reform measures are already urgent and pressing tasks. No one should be allowed to abandon leadership with a pessimistic and disappointed attitude; nor should anyone be allowed to use coercive orders to complete tasks.

### 不能放弃领导，也不能强迫命令

    不能放弃领导，也不能强迫命令
    吴尔祥
    目前在广东省部分农村中，出现了这样一些情况：有一些工作人员，不久以前，他们盲目地认为社会主义既已经在农村中取得了绝对的优势，一切工作当然就会一帆风顺，不会再有什么困难了。于是，他们满足于高高在上地订计划、发号令，不再进行艰苦的群众工作。现在他们把自己的计划拿到群众中去对证了一下，看群众已经做了多少。结果发现自己订的原来只是一个空计划。但是农时已经很紧迫，怎么办呢？他们泄气了，本来可以做到的事现在不做了；做起来虽然有些困难，但是还是可以做到的事，他们也放弃了。比如潮安县枫洋乡原来计划将20％的稻田改为单株密植，现在他们一亩也不改了；浮洋乡的增产计划本来是可以完成的，碰到一些困难以后，他们就把计划降低了5％。
    还有一种严重的情况，是有些工作人员，看计划有落空的危险，他们激动起来了，为了完成计划，竟不惜采取强迫命令的办法。比如湛江专区计划今年要消灭全区一百多万亩的撒种田。这本来是件好事，如果能够把撒种改为插秧或条播，可以增产一、二倍，而且这个计划也是可行的。可惜这个专区的一些工作人员光知道在上面发号令，而群众的习惯势力不是一道号令就可以改变的。结果你号令你的，群众还是按照自己的习惯去做。这怎么办呢？最简便的办法还是下命令。吴川县端德乡的驻社工作人员就是这样做的。他们看见群众采用撒种方法种了几亩田，就强迫群众把它犁掉改种。中共廉江县委书记下令把全县用来撒种的种籽全部收起来，说：“你不改也要改。”他以为这样做就可以使群众放弃撒种方法，但是事实并不是这样。海康县麻廉农业生产合作社的社员要撒种，干部不准，把种籽锁了起来，结果门给社员拆开了，种籽还是给弄走去撒种。全乡已经种下的六百多亩稻田，撒种田就占有90％。社员批评我们工作人员说：“你光空喊有什么用，还是说说消灭撒种有什么好处吧！你们不要拿我们的肚子做试验。”
    现在已经到插秧季节，而广东许多地区又发生了旱象。保证把秧苗插下去，保证实现大规模的技术改革措施，已经是刻不容缓的迫切任务。决不能容许任何一个人抱着悲观失望的态度，放弃领导；也不能容许任何人用强迫命令的方法去完成任务。
