    One Hundred and Sixty-One Heats of Steel Refined in One Day
    Xinhua News Agency Report – The two converters in the converter workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant broke their own national record set in March of 160 heats by refining 161 heats of steel on the 26th.
    The workers in this workshop had long planned to create a new record to greet "May Day" International Labor Day and the convening of the National Advanced Producers Representative Conference. On this day, the pig iron furnace workers supplied molten iron to the converters in a timely manner; the crane operators continuously transported the molten steel for casting. As a result, a new record was created.

The fine spinning workshop promoted the rapid splicing method, with the time for one splice averaging only 3.21 seconds, shortening it by 1.41 seconds compared to before. The doffing workers generally manage to keep one hundred or one hundred and twenty machines running without yarn breakage. Fifteen workers from the automatic cloth machine team B of the Harbin Flax Textile Factory proposed a quality competition to other teams, and now five weavers, including Liu Chunhua and Zhao Yingliang, have achieved a 100% product quality.

Among them, pig iron exceeded the same period in March by 1.4%; metallurgical coke exceeded the same period in March by 1.1%; and Dagushan Iron Mine exceeded the same period in March by more than one time.
    In April, various plants and mines also continuously created new daily output records.
    Ensure Timely Completion of Spring Planting
