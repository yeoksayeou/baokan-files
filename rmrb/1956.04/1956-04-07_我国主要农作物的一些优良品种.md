Some Excellent Varieties of Main Crops in Our Country

	Rice

	Rice is a crop widely distributed in our country. There are indica rice, japonica rice, and glutinous rice types of rice. Each type has many varieties. "Nante No. 1," "Yinfang," "10509," and "Zhechang No. 9" are several prominent of the many excellent rice varieties. These several excellent varieties have different excellent characteristics.

	"Nante No. 1" is an early to mid-maturing indica rice variety, which can avoid rice borers, has strong resistance to rice blast, and generally yields 500 to 600 catties per mu, with many yielding more than 1,000 catties per mu.

	"Yinfang" is a late-maturing japonica rice variety in the Tianjin area, and a mid-maturing variety in the Yangtze River area. Yinfang japonica rice has strong stalks, is resistant to fertilizer, is not easy to lodge, has a high rice yield, good rice quality, and strong resistance to soil salinity. It has a high yield, generally 700 to 800 catties per mu, and some have yielded more than 1,600 catties per mu.

	"10509" is a late-maturing japonica rice variety in Zhejiang and Nanjing areas. It has a long growing period and is used as a single-season late rice in addition to being used as a double-cropping late rice in some areas. "10509" has strong resistance to rice blast. If transplanted in a timely manner, rice borers are very light, and the general yield is about 600 catties per mu.

	"Zhechang No. 9" is a late-maturing indica rice variety in the South, which can be cultivated as a single-season late rice or as a double-cropping late rice. This variety is more drought-resistant and has a strong ability to resist rice blast and avoid rice borers. In drought years, it can be sown as late as mid-June. Under normal cultivation conditions, the general yield is about 500 catties.

		Wheat

	Wheat is also a crop widely distributed in our country. Most wheat varieties in our country belong to soft-grained wheat, and hard-grained wheat is extremely rare. Spring wheat areas in the Northeast and Northwest and winter wheat areas in South China are mostly spring varieties, North China is mostly winter varieties, and the Yangtze River Basin and Zhejiang and Hunan are mostly semi-winter varieties. Among these varieties, there are different growth periods such as early-maturing, mid-maturing, and late-maturing; there are varieties with strong resistance to natural disasters such as drought, flood, disease, and insects; and there are also varieties that are fertilizer-resistant, high-yielding, and of high quality.

	"Bima No. 1" is a semi-winter wheat variety with strong resistance to stripe rust, relatively light infection of loose smut, leaf rust, and stem smut, and is relatively resistant to fertilizer, drought, and spring frost. This variety has large grains and good quality, with a general yield of 200 to 300 catties per mu, and some reaching 600 to 700 catties.

	"Nanda 2419" is a wheat variety in the Yangtze River area with strong resistance to stripe rust, leaf rust, and wheat midges, and also has resistance to loose smut. This variety has large grains, good quality, is fertilizer-resistant, not easy to lodge, and matures earlier, making it suitable for cultivation in rice-wheat and wheat-cotton double-cropping areas in the South. It can also be used for spring sowing when winter sowing is not possible. The general yield is 200 to 300 catties per mu, and some reach 850 catties.

	"Gansu No. 96" is a wheat variety in the spring wheat areas of Northwest and Northeast China. It has strong resistance to stem rust and stripe rust, and also has certain resistance to loose smut, stinking smut, nematode disease, and leaf rust. It has strong resistance to spring cold, is fertilizer-resistant, not easy to lodge, suitable for mechanical harvesting, and high yield is also its excellent characteristic. Under suitable cultivation conditions, the yield per mu can reach about 400 catties.

	"Zaoyangmai" (also known as Nongda No. 1) is a good variety being promoted in southern Shanxi, southern Hebei, and near Beijing. "Zaoyangmai" has strong resistance to stripe rust and leaf rust, relatively light infection of stinking smut, stem smut, and nematode disease, and also has strong resistance to spring frost. Because "Zaoyangmai" also has the excellent characteristics of fertilizer resistance, strong stalks, not easy to lodge, and not easy to shatter, it is suitable for mechanical harvesting. This variety has large grains and good quality, and the general yield is 20% to 70% higher than local varieties, with a maximum yield of over 700 catties per mu.

		Corn

	Corn is a high-yield crop that is being developed in many areas of our country. There are also many types of varieties, generally divided into dent type and flint type. Dent-type varieties such as Baimaya and Jinhuanghou generally have the excellent characteristics of high yield and fertilizer resistance. Flint-type varieties, such as Xiaolihong and Zhonglihuang, generally have the advantages of early maturity, good quality, and low requirements for soil fertility, and are mostly used for spring sowing, summer sowing, or autumn sowing in southern provinces. In addition, there are many corn single-cross seeds being promoted in various places, and the general yield increase effect is more than 30%. "Fangza No. 2" is one of them.

	"Jinhuanghou" is a corn variety with a wide adaptability and a relatively long growing period. It is generally used for spring sowing in North China. In areas with suitable natural conditions, it is also used for summer sowing. It has tall plants, large ears, and many grains. Under excellent cultivation conditions, the yield increase potential is very large, with a general yield of about 500 catties per mu, and some yielding as high as 1,757 catties.

	"Fangza No. 2" is a corn hybrid variety promoted in eastern and south-central Shandong, with a growing period of about 95 days, suitable for summer sowing. "Fangza No. 2" has high resistance to smut, spot disease, and coal streak disease, and has good quality. The general summer sowing yield is about 400 catties per mu, and some reach 900 catties.

	The first generation of this hybrid variety has a very high yield, but from the second generation onwards, the yield will decrease year by year. Therefore, to maintain the high yield of this variety, it is necessary to use its parent Xiaolihong and Jinhuanghou to crossbreed every year to produce the first generation hybrid seeds for annual sowing.

		Soybeans

	Soybeans include green beans, yellow beans, and black beans. The Northeast is the main soybean producing area in our country, and there are many excellent soybean varieties, generally late-maturing spring-sown varieties with high oil content and yield. Soybean varieties in the Huaihe and Yangtze River basins are generally early-maturing summer-sown varieties with lower oil content. Soybean varieties generally have very small regional adaptability, so special attention should be paid to introduction and promotion.

	"Mancangjin" is a good soybean variety in the Harbin (Heilongjiang Province) area. The growing period is about 125 days, the quality is good, and the oil content is 2% higher than general varieties. "Mancangjin" has a high yield, ranging from 200 to 240 catties per mu, which is 20% to 30% higher than general varieties.

	"Xiaojinhuang No. 1" is a good soybean variety in Jilin and Liaoning provinces, with a growing period of more than 130 days, strong drought resistance, and very high oil content. The general yield per mu is about 240 catties, which is more than 10% higher than local varieties.

		Millet (Foxtail Millet)

	Millet is the main crop in North China, Northeast China, and other regions. The varieties are extremely complex, and some counties have dozens of varieties. The quality, yield, resistance to diseases and insects, and adaptability to natural conditions of each variety are also diverse. As long as you carefully select from the local farmer varieties, you can select better excellent varieties. The following are two grain varieties with a wide planting area.

	"Huanong No. 4" is an excellent grain variety in some parts of North China. The stems are thick and strong, not easy to lodge, and the growing period is 110 days, maturing earlier. It also has the excellent characteristics of being relatively drought-resistant, flood-resistant, large grains, good quality, and high rice yield. The general yield of this variety is about 300 catties per mu, and many yield more than 600 catties per mu.

	"Bayiyi Gu" is an excellent grain variety in some parts of Hebei and Shandong. It has strong resistance to white hair disease and black ear disease, has a long growing period, and is suitable for spring sowing. The general yield per mu is about 300 catties, and with good cultivation, it can produce more than 600 catties.

		Sorghum

	Sorghum is also the main crop in Northeast China, North China, and other regions. There are varieties for food, feed, and both food and feed. There are many excellent sorghum varieties stored by farmers in our country, many of which are high-yielding, high-quality, and adaptable varieties. "Xiaobakuocha" and "Yangdali" are two good farmer varieties.

	"Xiaobakuocha" is an early-maturing (growing period of 110 days) good sorghum variety in Chaoyang County, Liaoning Province. "Xiaobakuocha" has many tillers, is resistant to fertilizer, not easy to lodge, has strong resistance to diseases and insect pests, and has a slightly astringent taste when eaten. It is a variety for both food and feed. With good planting, more than 800 catties can be harvested per mu.

	"Yangdali" is a good sorghum variety in Yixian County, Liaoning. This good variety has the excellent characteristics of fertilizer resistance, drought resistance, flood resistance, good quality, high rice yield, and tight ears, but the stalks are brittle and the wind resistance is weak. Its growing period is long, about 140 days, and the general yield is about 700 catties per mu, which is 20% to 30% higher than other local varieties.

		Tuber Crops

	Tuber crops mainly include sweet potatoes and potatoes. There are many areas in northern and southern China that plant these two types of tuber crops on a large scale. There are also many varieties of tuber crops, including varieties with sweet taste, less fiber, and suitable for food, varieties with very high yield, more fiber, and suitable for feed, and varieties with high starch content and suitable for industrial use. The growing period and adaptability of each variety are also very different.

	"Shengli Baihao" is a good sweet potato variety with a wide adaptability. It has the excellent characteristics of fertilizer resistance, short vines, early tuber formation, large tubers, and concentrated distribution. "Shengli Baihao" has more starch, a higher drying rate, and a great yield increase potential. The general yield per mu is about 3,000 catties, and many yield more than 10,000 catties per mu. In the case of abnormal transplanting, it can be transplanted appropriately late, which is also a characteristic of "Shengli Baihao".

	"Nanruichao" is a good sweet potato variety in Sichuan and near Nanjing. It has short vines, is resistant to fertilizer, has concentrated tuber formation, good quality, sweet taste, and less fiber, but is not drought-resistant and germinates slowly. The general yield is more than 2,000 catties per mu, which is 30% to more than 100% higher than other local varieties in Nanjing.

	"Huabei 117" is a good sweet potato variety that is beginning to be promoted in the North China region. It has strong adaptability, is relatively fertilizer-resistant, drought-resistant, and frost-resistant, has early tuber formation, and has a concentrated distribution. It can be planted in spring or summer. The tuber moisture content is slightly less than "Shengli Baihao", and the taste is also better. The fresh potato yield is about the same as "Shengli Baihao", and the dry potato weight per mu is 10% to 30% higher than Shengli Baihao.

	"Nanjue" is an early-maturing and high-yielding potato variety in Liaoning, Hebei, and other provinces, with a growing period of about 90 to 100 days. In low-lying areas, it can avoid autumn flooding. "Nanjue" has good quality, white flesh, is relatively delicate, has less moisture, is more resistant to storage, has large and relatively uniform tubers, concentrated tuber formation, and a high yield.

		Oil Crops

	There are many types of oil crops, including annual oil crops such as rapeseed, peanuts, sesame, and sunflower, and perennial woody oil crops such as oil tea and walnuts. Each oil crop has many varieties, and their yield, oil yield, adaptability, and biological characteristics have significant differences. At present, some oil crop varieties have not been identified, so excellent varieties have not been determined in most areas.

	"Shengli Rapeseed" is a good rapeseed variety in the Yangtze River area. The plants are tall, the growing period is long, the early growth is slow, the development is vigorous after the beginning of spring, the cold resistance is strong, it can resist toxin diseases, and it is resistant to fertilizer.

	"Shengli Rapeseed" has large grains, high oil content (generally 47 catties of oil per 100 catties), and a high yield. The general yield is about 200 catties per mu, and high-yielding areas can harvest 450 catties per mu, which is 50% to 100% higher than other local varieties.

	"Yiwohou" is a better peanut variety in the North China area. The stems are erect, mature early (generally 7 to 10 days earlier than the spreading type), the plants are compact, the pod-setting is concentrated, and they are fertilizer-resistant and drought-resistant. "Yiwohou" has large grains and a high yield. The general yield per mu is about 300 catties, and some have 1,048 catties.

	"Bawangbian" is a widely adaptable sesame variety. The plants are tall, the internodes are short, the stems are thick and strong, and it has strong wind and waterlogging resistance, making it suitable for intercropping with crops such as cotton. "Bawangbian" has many capsules (generally three capsules grow in each leaf axil) and a high yield (generally about 120 catties per mu), and 45 catties of oil can be extracted from every 100 catties of sesame.

		Cotton

	The main cotton species cultivated in our country is upland cotton, which accounts for more than 83% of the total cotton field area. The second is medium cotton. Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and other places also plant perennial tree cotton, which belongs to a type of sea island cotton. The following are several upland cotton varieties used in production.

	"Sizi Cotton Erbi" is mainly adapted to the Yellow River Basin cotton area. The bolls are large, the fiber length is more than 30 mm, and the ginning percentage is more than 35%.

	"Daizi No. 15" is the most commonly cultivated excellent cotton variety in the Yangtze River Basin cotton area. It grows vigorously, the boll weight is about 5 grams, the fiber length is about 31 mm, the ginning percentage is high, generally around 40%, and the yield is high. In Cixi County, Zhejiang, the average yield per mu of "Daizi No. 15" planted in 520,000 mu of cotton fields in the county in 1955 was 85 catties of lint.

	"Yilingbafu" is a mid-maturing excellent cotton variety promoted in Xinjiang. The bolls are large, the boll weight is about 7 grams, the ginning percentage is 35% to 36%, and the fiber length is medium. This good variety is relatively resistant to verticillium wilt and has a high yield. The general yield per mu is more than 300 catties of seed cotton, and some can produce about 900 catties.

	"Liuyi Yibo" is also an early-maturing excellent cotton variety promoted in Xinjiang. The growing period is 137 days, the average boll weight is 4.3 grams, the ginning percentage is generally around 33%, the fiber length is medium, the stem is elastic, and the fruit branches are thin and tough. The general yield per mu is about 400 catties of seed cotton.

		Hemp

	There are many types of hemp, including jute, kenaf, ramie, sisal, hemp (also known as white hemp), flax (also known as linseed), and abutilon. At present, the most used in the textile industry are jute, kenaf, ramie, and flax. Each type of hemp has many varieties. The excellent varieties of jute and kenaf have generally been identified, and most of the other hemp varieties have not been identified.

	"Bailianzhi" is a round-fruit type good jute variety selected by the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and it is currently being propagated and promoted in Zhejiang and other provinces. This good variety has slightly shorter plants, medium branching, thinner and softer stems, is resistant to moisture, has resistance to anthracnose, and has a high and stable yield, generally increasing the yield by 50 to 80 catties compared to farmer varieties.

	"Xinxuan No. 1" is a round-fruit type good jute variety selected and bred in Guangdong. The plants are tall, the branching is also high off the ground, the resistance to anthracnose is particularly strong, and the yield is high. The general yield per mu is more than 500 catties of hemp bark, which is about 10% higher than general farmer varieties.

		Sugar Crops

	There are many types of sugar crops. At present, the raw materials for sugar production mainly rely on two types: sugarcane and sugar beet. Many areas south of the Yangtze River in our country cultivate sugarcane. Many areas in the northern Northeast cultivate sugar beet. Sugarcane varieties are mostly introduced from the Nanyang area. Sugar beet varieties are mostly introduced from the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe. Domestic agricultural scientific research institutions are also currently conducting the selection and breeding of excellent sugar crop varieties.

	"Taiwan Sugar 134" is a good sugarcane variety in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian. It has strong drought resistance, light insect damage, strong stubble power, and full stems. It can grow well in both paddy fields and dry land. The sugar content is 15%, which is about 30% higher than the Java 2878 sugarcane variety cultivated locally. This variety grows quickly during the germination and tillering stages, but has the disadvantage of being easily broken by wind and lodging in the later stages.

	"Youyi Seed" is a good sugar beet variety introduced from Poland and promoted in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, and other places. It has the ability to resist drought, waterlogging, and brown spot disease. The sugar content is 20%, and the general yield per mu is about 5,000 catties, which is more than 10% higher than the yield of local varieties, and the sugar content is about 1.5% higher.

		Tobacco

	Tobacco is generally divided into flue-cured tobacco and sun-cured tobacco. Flue-cured tobacco is the main raw material for the cigarette industry. In the past, most of the flue-cured tobacco varieties in our country were introduced from foreign countries. Although Chinese farmers have cultivated many good varieties in their long-term labor, they have not been discovered for a long time.

	"Yunnan Duoye Tobacco" is a flue-cured tobacco variety selected from Yuxi, Yunnan. The plants are 300-400 cm high, and each plant grows 120-150 leaves. The general yield per mu is about 500 catties, and some reach 800 catties, which is two to three times higher than the yield of general flue-cured tobacco varieties. The leaves are relatively thin, and the tobacco color is light yellow or golden after curing. The sugar content of the waist leaves is 16.93%, and the nicotine content is 1.19%, which meets the industrial use standards.

    我国主要农作物的一些优良品种
    群力
    稻谷
    稻谷是我国分布面积很大的一种作物。稻谷中有籼稻、粳稻、糯稻等类型。每一种类型，都有很多品种。“南特号”、“银坊”、“一○五○九号”、“浙场九号”就是许多水稻优良品种中的突出的几个。这几个优良品种都具有不同的优良特性。
      “南特号”是一个早中熟的籼稻良种，能避免螟害，抵抗稻热病能力很强，产量一般每亩收五、六百斤，每亩收一千斤以上的也很多。
      “银坊”在天津一带是晚熟粳稻良种，在长江一带则是中熟的品种。银坊粳稻杆硬，耐肥，不易倒伏，出米率高，米质好，抵抗土壤盐碱能力较强。产量高，一般每亩收七、八百斤，也有每亩收到一千六百多斤的。
      “一○五○九号”是浙江和南京一带的晚熟粳稻品种。它的生长期长，除作单季晚稻外，有些地区也用作双季连作晚稻。“一○五○九号”抗稻热病能力较强，如适时移栽，螟害很轻，一般产量，每亩收六百斤左右。
      “浙场九号”是南方的晚熟籼稻良种，既可作单季晚稻的栽培，也可做双季稻晚稻的栽培。这个品种比较耐旱，抵抗稻热病和逃避螟害的能力也较强，在干旱的年代，可以延迟到六月中旬播种。在正常栽培情况下，一般产量五百斤左右。
            小麦
    小麦在我国也是分布面积很广的作物。我国小麦品种多属于软粒小麦，硬粒小麦极少。东北、西北的春麦地区和华南的冬麦地区多为春性品种，华北一带多为冬性品种，长江流域及浙江湖南多为半冬性品种。这些品种中还有早熟、中熟、晚熟等不同的生育期；有抵抗旱、涝、病、虫等自然灾害能力较强的品种，也有耐肥、丰产、质优的品种。
      “碧蚂一号”是半冬性的小麦良种，抵抗条锈病能力很强，感染散黑穗病、叶锈病、秆黑粉病比较轻，比较耐肥，耐旱，抵抗春霜的能力也较强。这个品种的子粒大，品质好，一般产量每亩二、三百斤，也有六、七百斤的。
    “南大二四一九号”是长江一带的小麦良种，抵抗条锈病、叶锈病和吸浆虫的能力很强，对散黑穗病也有抵抗能力。这个品种的子粒大，品质好，耐肥，不易倒伏，成熟较早，适宜南方稻麦和麦棉两熟地区的栽培，在冬季不能正常播种时，也可用作春播。一般产量每亩二、三百斤，也有八百五十斤的。
    “甘肃九十六号”是西北和东北春麦区的小麦良种。它的抵抗秆锈病和条锈病的能力很强，对散黑穗病，腥黑穗病，腺虫病，叶锈病也有一定的抵抗能力。抵抗春寒的能力较强，耐肥，不易倒伏，适宜机械收割，品质较好，产量高也是它的优良特性。这个品种在耕作栽培适宜的情况下，每亩产量能到四百斤左右。
      “早洋麦”（又名农大一号）是晋南、冀南和北京附近正在推广的良种。“早洋麦”抵抗条锈病、叶锈病的能力很强，感染腥黑穗病、秆黑粉病和腺虫病比较轻，对春霜的抵抗能力也很强。由于“早洋麦”还具有耐肥，秆硬，不易倒伏，不易落粒的优良特性，因此适宜机械收割。这个品种的子粒大，品质较好，一般产量比当地土种增产二成到七成，每亩的最高产量可以收到七百斤以上。
            玉米
    玉米是我国不少地区正在发展着的一种高产作物，品种的类型也很多，一般分为马齿型和礈石型两种，马齿型的品种如白马牙，金皇后等，一般具有产量高，耐肥的优良特性。礈石型的品种，如小粒红、中粒黄等，一般具有早熟，品质好，对土壤肥力要求不高的优点，在南方各省多用作春播、夏播或秋播。此外各地正在推广的玉米单杂交的种子也很多，一般增产效果都在三成以上，“坊杂二号”就是其中的一个。
    “金皇后”是一个适应性很广的玉米品种，生长期较长，华北地区一般用作春播，在自然条件适宜的地区，也有用作夏播的。它的植株高，穗子大，粒子多，在耕作栽培优良的情况下，增产潜力很大，每亩一般产量在五百斤左右，高的每亩有收到1，757斤的。
      “坊杂二号”是山东东部和中南部推广的玉米杂交品种，生长期约95天，适宜夏播。“坊杂二号”对黑穗病、斑点病、煤纹病有较高的抵抗能力，品质较好。夏播的一般每亩产量四百斤左右，高的九百斤。
    这个杂交品种，第一代的产量很高，但自第二代起，产量要逐年降低。因此，要保持这个品种的高产量，就需要每年用它的亲本小粒红和金皇后来杂交，以便产生第一代的杂交种，作每年播种之用。
            大　豆
    大豆中包括青豆、黄豆和黑豆。东北为我国主要大豆产区，大豆的优良品种也很多，一般是春播的晚熟品种，含油量和产量均高。淮河和长江流域的大豆品种，一般是夏播的成熟较早的品种，含油量较低。大豆品种的区域适应性一般都很小，因此，在引种和推广时要特别注意。
      “满仓金”是哈尔滨（黑龙江省）一带的大豆良种。生长期125日左右，品质好，比一般品种的含油量高2％。“满仓金”的产量高，每亩产量二百到二百四十斤不等，比一般品种增产二到三成。
      “小金黄一号”是吉林和辽宁两省的一个大豆良种，生长期130天以上，耐旱性较强，含油量很高，每亩一般产量二百四十斤左右，比当地种一般增产一成以上。
          小米（粟）
    小米是华北、东北等地区的主要作物，品种极其复杂，有的一个县就有几十个品种。每个品种的品质、产量、抵抗病虫及适应自然条件的能力，也是多种多样的。只要在当地农家品种中细心选择，就能选出更好的优良品种，下面是种植面积较广的两个谷种。
      “华农四号”是华北部分地区的优良谷种，茎秆粗壮，不易倒伏，生长期110天，成熟较早。它还有比较耐旱、耐涝，子粒大，品质好，出米多的优良特性。这个品种的一般每亩产量是三百斤左右，每亩收到六百斤以上的也很多。
      “八一一谷”是河北、山东部分地区的优良谷种，抵抗白发病和黑穗病的能力较强，生长期较长，适宜春播。一般亩产量三百斤左右，耕作栽培好的，可以产六百斤以上。
            高　粱
    高粱也是我国东北、华北等地区的主要作物。有食用、饲用和食饲兼用的品种。我国农家蕴藏着的高粱优良品种很多，其中有不少是产量高，品质好，适应性强的品种。“小八扩杈”、“洋大粒”就是两个农家良种。
      “小八扩杈”是辽宁省朝阳县的一个早熟（生长期110天）高粱良种。“小八扩杈”分蘖多、耐肥、不易倒伏、抵抗病虫害的能力较强，吃时稍有涩味，是食粮和饲料两用的品种。种植好的每亩可以收到八百斤以上。
     “洋大粒”是辽宁义县的一个高粱良种。这个良种具有耐肥、抗旱、抗涝、品质好、出米率高、穗紧等优良特性，但是秆脆，抗风力较弱。它的生长期长，约140
  日，一般每亩收七百斤左右，较当地别的品种增产二成到三成。
          薯类作物
    薯类主要包括甘薯和马铃薯两种。我国北方、南方大面积种植这两种薯类的地区很多。薯类的品种也很多，有食味香甜纤维少适于食用的品种，有产量很高纤维较多适于饲用的品种，也有淀粉的含量高适于工业用的品种，每个品种的生长期和适应性也很不相同。
      “胜利百号”是一个适应能力较广的甘薯良种，具有耐肥，蔓短，结薯早，薯块大，分布集中的优良特性。“胜利百号”含淀粉较多，晒干率较高，增产潜力很大，一般每亩产量为三千斤左右，每亩收到一万斤以上的也很多。在不能正常栽插的情况下，可以适当的晚插，这也是“胜利百号”的一个特点。
      “南瑞苕”是四川和南京附近的甘薯良种，蔓短，耐肥，结薯集中，品质好，味香甜，纤维少，但是不耐干旱，发芽较慢。一般每亩收二千多斤，在南京比当地别的品种增产三成到一倍以上。
      “华北一一七”是华北地区开始推广的甘薯良种，适应性较强，比较耐肥、耐旱、耐霜，结薯早，分布集中，春栽或夏栽都可以。薯块含水量较“胜利百号”略少，食味也较好，鲜薯产量和“胜利百号”不相上下，干薯的重量每亩高出胜利百号一成到三成。
      “南爵”是辽宁和河北等省的一个早熟丰产的马铃薯良种，生长期约九十到一百天，在低洼地区，可以逃避秋涝。“南爵”的品质较好，肉白色，比较细腻，水分少，较耐储藏，块大而比较整齐，结薯集中，产量较高。
          油料作物
    油料作物的种类很多，有一年生的油料作物，如油菜、花生、芝麻、向日葵等。也有多年生的木本油料作物如油茶、核桃等。每一种油料作物都有很多品种，它们的产量，出油量、适应性和生物学特性等方面，都有显著的差别。目前有些油料作物品种尚未鉴定，因此优良品种在大部地区还没有确定。
      “胜利油菜”是长江一带的油菜良种，植株高大，生长期较长，前期生长较慢，开春以后发育旺盛，抗寒能力较强，能抵抗毒素病，耐肥。
  “胜利油菜”的子粒大、含油量高（一般每一百斤含油47斤），产量高，一般每亩收二百斤左右，高产的每亩能收四百五十斤，比当地别的品种增产五成到一倍。
      “一窝猴”是华北一带较好的花生良种，茎直立，成熟早（比蔓生种一般早熟七到十天），植株紧凑，结果集中，耐肥，抗旱。“一窝猴”的子粒大，产量高，一般亩产量三百斤左右，高的有1，048斤。
    “霸王鞭”是适应性较广的芝麻良种，植株高，节间短，茎杆粗壮，抗风和耐涝能力较强，适宜和棉花等作物间作。“霸王鞭”的蒴果多（一般每一叶腋着生三蒴）产量高（一般每亩收120斤左右），每百斤芝麻出油45斤左右。
            棉花
    我国栽培的棉种主要是陆地棉，约占总棉田面积的83％以上。其次是中棉。云南、广西、广东、福建等地并种有多年生木棉，是属于海岛棉的一种。下面是生产上应用的几个陆地棉良种。
      “斯字棉二比”主要适应于黄河流域棉区，铃大，纤维长度在30毫米以上，衣分在35％以上。
      “岱字十五号”是长江流域棉区栽培最普遍的优良棉种，生育健壮，铃重五克左右，纤维长度约31毫米，衣分高，一般在40％左右，产量高。在浙江慈溪县种植的“岱字十五号”1955年全县52万亩棉田的平均亩产量是皮棉85斤。
      “一○八夫”是新疆推广的中熟优良棉种，铃大、铃重七克左右，衣分35％到36％，纤维长度中等。这个良种比较能抗黄萎病，产量较高，一般每亩产籽棉三百斤以上，部分能产九百斤左右。
      “六一一波”也是新疆推广的早熟优良棉种，生长期137天，铃重平均为4.3克，衣分一般在33％左右，纤维长度中等，茎有弹性，果枝细而坚韧。一般每亩收籽棉四百斤左右。
              麻
    麻的种类很多，有黄麻、洋麻、苎麻、剑麻、大麻（又名白麻）、亚麻（又名胡麻）、苘麻等。目前在纺织工业上利用最多的是黄麻、洋麻、苎麻和亚麻。每一种麻有很多的品种，黄麻和洋麻的优良品种大体上已鉴定出来，其余麻类品种大部尚未鉴定。
    “白莲芝”是浙江农业科学研究所选出，目前已经在浙江等省繁殖推广的一个圆果型黄麻良种。这个良种的植株略矮，分杈中等，茎较细软，耐湿，对炭疽病有抵抗能力，产量高而稳定，一般比农家品种增产五十至八十斤。
    “新选一号”是广东选育出的一个圆果型黄麻良种，植株高，分杈离地面也高，抵抗炭疽病能力特别强，产量高，一般每亩产麻皮五百多斤，较一般农家种增产一成左右。
          糖料作物
    糖料作物的种类很多。目前制糖的原料，主要是靠甘蔗和甜菜两种。我国长江以南栽培甘蔗的很多。东北北部栽培甜菜的很多。甘蔗品种多从南洋一带引入。甜菜品种多从东欧的人民民主国家引入。国内农业科学试验研究机构目前也在进行糖料作物的优良品种的选育。
      “台糖134号”是广东、广西、福建的甘蔗良种。它的抗旱能力强，虫害轻，宿根力强，茎充实，在水田和旱地都能生长良好，含糖率15％，比当地栽培的爪哇2878号甘蔗种增产三成左右。这个品种在萌芽、分蘖时期，生长很快，但是有后期容易风折、倒伏的缺点。
      “友谊种”是从波兰引进的甜菜良种，在黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古等地推广。它有抗旱、抗涝、抗褐斑病的能力，含糖率是20％，一般每亩产量五千斤左右，较当地品种的产量高出一成以上，含糖率高出1.5％左右。
          烟草
    烟草一般分烤烟和晒烟两类，烤烟是卷烟工业的主要原料，过去我国的烤烟品种，多从外国引入。我国农民长期劳动中虽然培育出不少良种，但是很长时间没有发掘出来。
    “云南多叶烟”是从云南玉溪选出的烤烟良种，植株高300—400公分，每株生长叶片120—150片，一般每亩产量为五百斤左右，高的达到八百斤，较一般烤烟品种的产量高出二倍到三倍。叶片较薄，烤后烟色淡黄或金黄，腰叶含的醣量为16.93％，含烟碱量为1.19％，适合于工业上的使用标准。
