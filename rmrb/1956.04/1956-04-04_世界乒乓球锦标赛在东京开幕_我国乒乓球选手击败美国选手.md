Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: Chinese men's table tennis players defeated American players five to four on the opening day of the 1956 World Table Tennis Championships in Tokyo tonight.

In the Swaythling Cup (men's team) competition, the match between the Chinese and American players aroused great interest among 5,000 spectators. The match was the highlight of many tense matches on the first day at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.

At the start, American national champion Erwin Klein defeated Wang Chuanyao two to one, earning the first point for the American team. China's top player Jiang Yongning defeated Bernard Bukiet, tying the score at one to one. Harry Hirschkowitz won against Cen Huaiguang, putting the American team ahead again.

But Jiang Yongning, who is good at using chop defense, came on the court again. He saved seemingly unsavable difficult shots and finally frustrated the calm, left-handed American champion. The score was: 21-6, 19-21, 21-16.

Next, Hirschkowitz defeated Wang Chuanyao again, Cen Huaiguang defeated Bukiet, Jiang Yongning defeated Hirschkowitz, and Klein defeated Cen Huaiguang, making the score four to four.

In the deciding match, Wang Chuanyao, who is good at fierce smashes, defeated Bukiet 21-14, 18-21, 21-13. The Chinese players finally defeated the American players five to four.

In the afternoon matches of the same day, China defeated South Vietnam, winning the first round of the Swaythling Cup.

In the Corbillon Cup (women's team) competition, China defeated India three to zero, but lost to South Korea one to three.

A total of seventeen teams are participating in this championship. These include Australia, Britain, China, Czechoslovakia, India, Japan, Romania, the United States, and Sweden. There are seven events in the championship, in addition to the team cups, there are men's and women's singles, doubles championships, and mixed doubles championships.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: On the second day of the 23rd World Table Tennis Championships, China first competed against Britain in the men's team "Swaythling Cup" competition. The Chinese players initially held an advantage of two to one, but finally lost to the British players two to five.

The match between China and Britain was a relatively heated and tense one. In particular, China's top player Jiang Yongning defeated Britain's Richard Bergmann, who had won the world championship twice, by two to one, which attracted great attention from the audience. In the match, Jiang Yongning firmly returned many hard shots from Bergmann using a defensive strategy, and his chop defense technique constantly won applause and cheers from the audience. After the match, Bergmann told reporters: "Since we defeated them five to zero in Mumbai in 1952, the Chinese players have made great progress." He said, "They played much better than we expected."

The Chinese men's players also competed against Czechoslovakia today, and as a result, lost to the Czechoslovakian players five to two.

In the women's team "Corbillon Cup" competition, the Chinese women's players lost to Britain one to three. However, Sun Meiying of the Chinese team defeated Diana Rowe, a British player who had won several championships in the World Table Tennis Championships in the past. The match between the Chinese team and the Japanese team was very intense and aroused great interest from more than 20,000 spectators. Although the Chinese team finally lost to the Japanese team by zero to three, the scores in each match were very close.

In the women's team competition, the powerful Romanian players defeated the United States and South Korea by three to zero successively, and each time won with an absolute advantage of two to zero.

After two days of competition, in the A and B groups of the men's team "Swaythling Cup" competition, Romania, Japan, Czechoslovakia, and Britain have not lost yet. In the women's team "Corbillon Cup" competition, Romania, Japan, and Britain have been victorious.
