    A Batch of Famous Shanghai Clothing Stores Move to Beijing
    Fifteen famous public-private partnership fashion and suit shops in Shanghai, including Lantian and Leimeng, have moved to Beijing in batches. Five more clothing stores, including Zao Cun, Wanguo, Bowei, and Hongxia, will move within the month.
    They are mainly moving to Beijing to meet the capital's people's increasingly high demands for clothing production.
    Among these twenty clothing stores, six are first-class in Shanghai in terms of design, tailoring, and sewing techniques, and each has its own special characteristics. Lantian Fashion Store is famous for its expertise in making women's slacks and various high-end women's shirts. Bowei and Leimeng Suit Stores are good at making men's and women's suits. Many private-sector personnel and employees in these clothing stores are designers and tailors with decades of experience.
    Currently, the Beijing Clothing Factory is looking for factory sites for these clothing stores. After these clothing stores officially open, they will generally maintain their original operating characteristics, and some will even retain their original names.

    上海一批著名服装店迁来北京
    上海市蓝天、雷蒙等十五家著名的公私合营时装西服店，已经分批迁来北京。还有造寸、万国、波纬、鸿霞等五家服装店将在月内迁来。
    它们主要是为了适应首都人民对服装制作上日益提高的要求而迁来北京的。
    在这二十家服装店中，有六家在设计、剪裁、缝纫技术上是上海第一流的，并且各具特长。蓝天时装店以擅长制作女西裤和各式高级女衬衫著名。波纬、雷蒙西服店擅长作男女西服。这些服装店中，有许多私方人员和职工是具有几十年经验的设计师和剪裁师。
    目前，北京市被服厂正在为这些服装店寻找厂址。这些服装店正式开业后一般将保持原有经营特点，有的还将保持原有字号。
