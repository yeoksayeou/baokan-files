Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 3rd. The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported: A mass rally with 25,000 participants was held in Tanjung Priok on April 2nd. The meeting passed a resolution requesting President Sukarno and Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo to use their influence to ensure the faithful implementation of the cabinet program and to meet the people's desire to improve the composition and personnel of the cabinet.

The acting General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Lukman, delivered a speech at the meeting, calling on all Indonesian people, whether they are communists or nationalists, to unite and take joint action to demand that the government earnestly implement its program. He said that the Indonesian Communist Party calls on the people to demand that the government guarantee their democratic rights and freedoms, abolish the anti-labor Tejokusuman law, realize the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements, carry out resolute armed action against the "Islamic State Movement" and "Indonesian Islamic Army" bandits, and unswervingly implement an independent foreign policy supporting peace and reject so-called "US aid" aimed at dragging Indonesia into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group.

Lukman emphasized that while adhering to the above political demands, the people should not relax their demands and actions for directly improving their daily lives.

Lukman said that the current task of the communists and those who voted for communist candidates in the general election is to resolutely implement a united policy based on an anti-colonialist and pro-democracy program, and to use this program as a weapon to defeat the reactionary policies of the Masyumi Party-Indonesian Socialist Party group.

Lukman said that the leaders of the Masyumi Party and their supporters—the right-wing socialists—fear the genuine implementation of the new cabinet's program. Some pro-Masyumi Party right-wing newspapers omitted some words in the program that clearly contradict the policies of the Masyumi Party when reporting on the program.

Lukman emphasized that if the Masyumi Party-Indonesian Socialist Party group hesitates in implementing the program of the cabinet they participate in, their true purpose will be more clearly exposed to their supporters and the broad masses.

    印度尼西亚丹绒不录港群众大会通过决议
    要求政府保证忠实地执行内阁政纲
    新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”报道：四月二日在丹绒不录港举行了一个有二万五千人参加的群众集会。会上通过决议要求苏加诺总统和沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理运用他们的影响，以保证内阁政纲得到忠实的执行，并且满足人民希望改善内阁成分和人员的要求。
    印度尼西亚共产党代理总书记鲁克曼在会上发表演说，号召全体印度尼西亚人民，不论他们是共产主义者还是民族主义者，都团结起来采取共同行动，要求政府认真地执行它的政纲。他说：印度尼西亚共产党号召人民要求政府保证他们的民主权利和自由，废除反劳工的特贾苏克马纳法，实现废除圆桌会议协定，对“回教国运动”和“印度尼西亚回教军”匪帮进行坚决的武装行动，坚持不渝地执行支持和平的独立的外交政策和拒绝以在于把印度尼西亚拖进东南亚条约组织集团为目的的所谓“美援”。
    鲁克曼强调指出，人民在坚持上述政治要求的时候也不要放松他们对直接改善他们的日常生活的要求和行动。
    鲁克曼说，共产党员们和在普选中投票支持共产党候选人的人们目前的任务是：坚决执行以反殖民主义和主张民主的政纲为基础的团结政策，并且要用这个政纲来作为挫败马斯友美党—印度尼西亚社会党集团的反动政策的武器。
    鲁克曼说，马斯友美党领袖们和他们的支持者——右翼社会党人——害怕真正贯彻新内阁的政纲。有些亲马斯友美党的右翼报纸在报道政纲的时候略去了政纲中一些显然同马斯友美党的政策相矛盾的字句。
    鲁克曼强调说，马斯友美党—印度尼西亚社会党集团如果在执行他们所参加的内阁的政纲的时候迟疑不前，他们的真正目的就将更加清楚地暴露在他们的支持者和广大群众的面前。
