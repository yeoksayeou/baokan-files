    "Times Morning Post" Comments on US "Aid":
    The People of Ceylon Cannot Be Bought with Dollars
    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, April 12th: The Ceylon "Times Morning Post" commented on April 11th on the news from the United States that the US intends to reconsider "aid" to Ceylon, saying:

    "If the United States withdraws its aid proposal, then Ceylon is happy to pay this price in order to maintain its independence. We have managed to survive without American aid for all these years, and our self-esteem cannot be bought with dollars."

    The newspaper said that Ceylon is only willing to accept foreign aid without conditions. It said: "If there is any country in the world that gives Ceylon aid without conditions, it will be as happy and grateful to accept such aid as Nehru's India. But it cannot be bought."

    “时代晨报”评美国的“援助”时说
    锡兰人民是不能用美元收买的
    据新华社12日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰“时代晨报”四月十一日对从美国方面传出的美国打算重新考虑对锡兰的“援助”的消息说：
    “如果美国撤回它的援助建议，那末，锡兰为了维持它的独立是乐于付出这笔代价的。这些年来，我们没有美援也终于活下来了，我们的自尊心是不能用美元收买的”。
    这家报纸说，锡兰只愿意接受不附带条件的外国援助。它说：“如果世界上有任何国家不附带条件给锡兰以援助，它将像尼赫鲁的印度那样，高兴地而且感激地接受这种援助。但是它不能被收买。”
