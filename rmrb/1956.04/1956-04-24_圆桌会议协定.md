Round Table Conference Agreement

On April 6, the Indonesian cabinet submitted a bill to the parliament to abolish the "Round Table Conference Agreement." On April 21, the bill was unanimously passed by the parliament. This bill declares that the relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands, established under the Round Table Conference Agreement concluded in The Hague in 1949, is abolished and invalid.

The "Round Table Conference Agreement" was signed by Indonesia and the Netherlands under the coercion of the United States, under the guise of the United Nations, when the Indonesian national liberation movement was surging after World War II and the Dutch colonialists could no longer rule as before. It included the so-called federal regulations and a series of agreements and documents related to diplomacy, defense, cultural affairs, and finance and economics. They stipulated that Indonesia should recognize the local state regimes supported by the Dutch colonialists and become a "Federal Republic." The "Federal Republic of Indonesia" must participate in the "Dutch-Indonesian Union" and recognize the Dutch Queen as the "Supreme Head of State." Indonesia should "cooperate permanently" with the Netherlands in diplomatic, defense, financial, economic, and cultural relations, and a "Council of Ministers" should be jointly established by the Netherlands and the "Federal Republic of Indonesia" to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. Indonesia could not hold negotiations in diplomatic affairs that were not in the interests of the Netherlands. The Netherlands dispatched a military delegation to Indonesia, and the Dutch Navy was allowed to use the Surabaya naval base. In economic terms, Indonesia had to recognize the existing privileges and concessions of the Netherlands in Indonesia. If Indonesia wanted to implement currency reforms or amend the organization law of banks, it had to obtain the consent of the Netherlands. Indonesia was responsible for repaying more than 4 billion guilders of debt originally belonging to the Dutch-Indonesian government, and so on.

This agreement was, in effect, an unequal treaty by which the Netherlands maintained its colonial interests in Indonesia under the guise of "transferring sovereignty." Therefore, this agreement was resolutely opposed by the Indonesian people from the very first day of its establishment. In August 1950, Indonesia had already dissolved the domestic local state regimes and reorganized itself into a unified republic, but remained a member of the "Dutch-Indonesian Union." In other respects, especially in finance and economics, the Dutch colonialists still enjoyed many privileges in Indonesia, bringing huge losses to the Indonesian state and people. According to statistics, in the second year after the agreement was signed alone, Dutch colonialists plundered 4.5 billion guilders in profits from Indonesia. The Dutch colonialists also forcibly occupied part of Indonesian territory—West Irian—and refused to return it.

In the past few years, Indonesia has held several negotiations with the Dutch government to abolish the Round Table Conference Agreement and recover West Irian, but without result. Therefore, the Indonesian people are increasingly strongly demanding measures to abolish the Round Table Conference Agreement. According to Rendul Nowo, the former chairman of the Indonesian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, from December 1949 to June 1954, the Indonesian Parliament had already received 163 proposals and resolutions from various parties and groups demanding the dissolution of the Dutch-Indonesian Union. Last August, people from all over Indonesia elected more than 700 representatives and held the All-Indonesia People's Congress, which passed resolutions to abolish the Round Table Conference Agreement and abolish all agreements that endanger national sovereignty and the interests of the people. In February of this year, the Indonesian Communist Party formally proposed to the parliament to unilaterally abolish the Round Table Conference Agreement. President Sukarno has also repeatedly called on the people to support the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement. There is no doubt that the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement is a major measure for Indonesia to complete and consolidate its independence and further get rid of the scourge of colonialism.

### 圆桌会议协定

    圆桌会议协定
    印度尼西亚内阁在四月六日向国会提出了废除“圆桌会议协定”的法案；二十一日，这个法案在国会获得了一致通过。这个法案宣布印度尼西亚同荷兰根据1949年在海牙缔结的圆桌会议协定建立起来的关系废除和无效。
    “圆桌会议协定”是在第二次世界大战后，印度尼西亚民族解放运动高涨、荷兰殖民者无法照旧统治下去的时候，由美国假借联合国名义出面干预，迫使印度尼西亚同荷兰签订的。其中包括有所谓联邦法规以及有关外交、防务、文化事务和财政经济等方面的一系列的协定和文件。它们规定：印度尼西亚要承认荷兰殖民者扶植起来的各地方邦区政权而成为一个“联邦共和国”。“印度尼西亚联邦共和国”必须参加“荷印联邦”，承认荷兰女皇为“最高元首”。印度尼西亚要同荷兰在外交、国防、财政、经济和文化关系上“持久合作”，并且要由荷兰与“印度尼西亚联邦共和国”联合设立一个干涉印度尼西亚内政的“部长会议”。印度尼西亚在外交方面不能举行不符合荷兰利益的谈判。荷兰派遣军事代表团驻在印度尼西亚，荷兰海军得使用泗水海军基地。在经济方面，印度尼西亚要承认荷兰在印度尼西亚的现有特权及让与。印度尼西亚如果要实行货币改革或修改银行的组织法，须经荷兰同意。印度尼西亚要负责偿还原属荷印政府的四十多亿盾的债务等等。
    这个协定，实际上是荷兰以“移交主权”为幌子来维持它在印度尼西亚的殖民利益的一个不平等条约。因此，这个协定从它成立的第一天起，就遭到印度尼西亚人民坚决的反对。1950年8月，印度尼西亚已解散国内的地方邦区，改组为统一的共和国，但仍为“荷印联邦”的成员。在其它方面，特别是在财政经济方面，荷兰殖民者仍在印度尼西亚享有许多特权，给印度尼西亚国家和人民带来巨大的损失。据统计，仅仅在协定签订的第二年，荷兰殖民者就从印度尼西亚掠夺了四十五亿盾的利润。荷兰殖民者并且还强占着印度尼西亚的一部分领土——西伊里安不肯归还。
    在过去几年中，印度尼西亚为了废除圆桌会议协定和收回西伊里安的问题，曾同荷兰政府举行了好几次谈判，但都没有结果。因此，印度尼西亚人民越来越强烈地要求采取措施来废除圆桌会议协定。据前任印度尼西亚国会外交小组委员会主席伦度诺乌说：从1949年12月至1954年6月，印度尼西亚国会就已经收到各党派团体关于要求解散荷印联邦的提案和决议163件。去年八月，印度尼西亚各地人民选出七百多名代表，举行了全印度尼西亚人民代表大会，通过了废除圆桌会议协定和废除一切危害国家主权和人民利益的协定的决议。今年二月印度尼西亚共产党向国会提出了正式要求单方面废止圆桌会议协定。苏加诺总统也一再号召人民支持废除圆桌会议协定。毫无疑问，废除圆桌会议协定，是印度尼西亚完成和巩固独立、进一步摆脱殖民主义祸害的一个重大措施。
