The entire national archives, including the archives of all agencies, military units, organizations, enterprises, and institutions since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the revolutionary historical archives and archives of the old regime before the founding of the People's Republic of China, are documentary materials formed in the social and political life of our country and are the historical wealth of our country. The task of archives work is to establish a national archives system under the principle of unified management of national archives and to scientifically manage these archives in order to facilitate the use of state organs' work and scientific research.

In recent years, China's archives work, through studying the advanced Soviet archives science knowledge and training archives work cadres, has made some achievements in establishing management systems and improving business methods; however, many comrades in various agencies do not have a sufficient understanding of the important role of archives work. Most agencies have not yet established a filing system, the management of archives is not centralized, the sorting methods are not unified or scientific, and there is a lack of certain standards and systems for appraisal and destruction. The archives work organizations of various levels of agencies are mostly incomplete, the number of staff is small, the business is unfamiliar, especially the lack of leading backbone. These situations make it impossible for the archives of some agencies to be scientifically sorted in a timely manner, scattered and mixed, difficult to find, and even phenomena such as no management, loss of documents, leakage of state secrets, and arbitrary destruction of documents occur, causing irreparable losses. As for the revolutionary historical archives and the archives of the old regime, only a part of the centralized management work has been carried out, and the vast majority is still managed by relevant agencies. Due to lax management, damage, loss, or arbitrary destruction are still very serious. As for the work of the archives, it is still in its initial stages. In order to rapidly strengthen the management of China's archives work and meet the urgent needs of state organs' work and scientific research for archival materials, the State Council hereby decides:

I. Strengthen the unified management of national archives work. The basic principle of archives work is to manage national archives in a centralized and unified manner, maintain the integrity and security of archives, and facilitate the use of various state tasks. The national archives work should be guided and supervised by the state archives management organs in a unified and hierarchical manner. The archival materials of various agencies (including the agency's received and sent documents, internal documents, meeting records, telephone records, technical documents, publication manuscripts, printing molds, photographs, films, recordings, etc.) should be managed centrally by the agency's archives business organization—the archives office—and should not be kept separately by the undertaking units or individuals; the archives of various agencies and the archives managed on behalf of others shall not be transferred, dispersed, or destroyed arbitrarily without the prescribed approval procedures. The part that needs to be preserved permanently should be concentrated in the National Archives of the Central Government or the local archives in accordance with unified regulations.

II. Comprehensively promote filing by document processing departments to establish a unified filing system. The documentary materials processed by various agencies should be sorted and filed by the document processing departments and filed to the agency's archives office on a regular basis, changing the erroneous practices of filing scattered documents as they are processed and filing in piles. The implementation of filing by document processing departments can give play to the advantages of document processing departments being familiar with relevant business and document processing processes, improve the quality of files and the efficiency of filing work; the document processing departments can temporarily save the documents of the year, greatly reducing the procedures for filing and retrieving files, and changing the phenomenon of decentralized document storage by the undertakers, which is conducive to the work of maintaining state secrets; at the same time, it can also free up the agency's archives office to do a good job in the sorting and organization of archives, and better serve the work of the agency. Those national agencies at the central level and at the level of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government that have already done so should pay attention to summing up experience, improving systems, consolidating achievements, and improving the efficiency and quality of work; those that have not yet done so should quickly make preparations and comprehensively promote them in 1956.

III. Rapidly sort out the accumulated archives since the founding of the country. The amount of archives accumulated by various agencies since the founding of the People's Republic of China is very large. In order to facilitate the use now and the transfer to the National Archives in the future, various agencies should conduct a serious sorting of the accumulated archives of their own agencies, clarify the scope of permanent preservation, regular preservation, and elimination and destruction, and deal with them separately in accordance with unified regulations; and through this sorting, gain experience and improve the agency's archives work system. The archives of the original large administrative regions that have been concentrated should be sorted out quickly in accordance with the formulated methods. When sorting out the accumulated archives of various agencies and the archives of the original large administrative regions managed on behalf of the Central Government and provincial, autonomous region, and municipal-level agencies, they should organize a certain force, strengthen leadership, and vigorously carry out the work, requiring it to be completed within 1956 and 1957. The accumulated archives of special and county-level agencies should also be sorted out.

IV. It is necessary to actively collect and sort out revolutionary historical archives and archives of the old regime scattered in various places. The revolutionary historical archives before the founding of the People's Republic of China should be investigated, collected, and initially sorted out by province, preparing to hand them over to the preparatory office of the Archives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for centralized sorting and preservation. The archives of the old regime managed on behalf of local units, except for the political archives of the enemy and puppet parties, groups, and special agents, police, and gendarmerie agencies, should be sorted out by the public security departments. Under the unified leadership and overall planning of the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal people's committees, the original entrusted agencies shall be responsible for doing a good job of sorting and reorganization within 1956 and 1957, and strengthen protection, so that they will be centralized to the designated national archives in accordance with unified regulations in the future.

V. The National Archives Bureau should give full play to its active role in guiding and supervising the national archives work while strengthening the overall planning work. To this end, it must maintain close contact with various agencies in archives work, strengthen investigation and research, thoroughly understand the situation, focus on checking the archives work of various places and agencies, summarize and promote advanced experience, and on this basis, quickly formulate archives work regulations, formulate regulations on the scope of filing and a standard table of archive retention periods, and establish a system for appraising and destroying archives, so that archives work can quickly get on the right track and catch up with the needs of national construction.

VI. Strengthen archives work organizations at all levels. The ministries and commissions of the State Council and the agencies directly under it should establish and strengthen archives offices under the General Office (Secretariat, Office) to be responsible for managing the archives of the agency; some departments may establish archives management departments (or bureaus) to guide and supervise the work of the agency's archives office and the archives work of the affiliated system. The people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should quickly establish archives management departments under the general office to be responsible for guiding and supervising the archives work of various departments, bureaus, and state organs at all levels below the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government; various departments and bureaus should establish archives offices to be responsible for managing the archives of the agency. Special and county-level agencies and enterprise units, institutions, and people's organizations at all levels should also establish archives offices or assign full-time cadres to manage archives. The National Archives Bureau should comprehensively plan and gradually establish national archives of the central government and local governments in the capital and various provinces and regions. The establishment of archives work organizations at all levels should be quickly determined by the establishment committees at all levels in accordance with work needs and the principle of simplification, and personnel should be assigned by the personnel departments; backbone forces must be equipped or supplemented where there is a lack of leading backbone.

VII. Step up the training of cadres and improve the business level and scientific level of archives work. In the future, the country's archives work cadres, in addition to being trained by the Department of Historical Archives of Renmin University of China, should pay special attention to running short-term training courses in a hierarchical and responsible manner to strengthen the business study of on-the-job cadres, combining practical work to improve their business level. The National Archives Bureau and the Department of Historical Archives of Renmin University of China should strengthen research on archival science and other auxiliary subjects to improve the scientific level. State organs at all levels should conduct a serious review of existing archives staff to ensure the purity of archives work organizations; newly transferred staff should have a certain political and cultural level so that they can quickly learn and master archives business. All on-the-job archives staff should work actively and study hard to become professional talents proficient in archives business.

Archives work is a specialized business and a confidential work, but it is still a relatively weak link in the current work of state organs, so leaders of state organs at all levels must pay sufficient attention to it. The general offices (secretariats, offices) of agencies must list archives work as one of the regular and important businesses, earnestly strengthen leadership, and continuously improve and improve the business level, so that it can play its due role in the country's various constructions.

After receiving this decision, the ministries and commissions of the State Council and the people's committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should quickly conduct research and implement it.

    国务院关于加强国家档案工作的决定
    国家的全部档案，包括中华人民共和国成立以来各机关、部队、团体、企业和事业单位的档案，中华人民共和国成立以前的革命历史档案和旧政权档案，都是我国社会政治生活中形成的文书材料，都是我们国家的历史财富。档案工作的任务就是要在统一管理国家档案的原则下建立国家档案制度，科学地管理这些档案，以便于国家机关工作和科学研究工作的利用。
    最近几年来，我国的档案工作，经过学习苏联的先进的档案科学知识和培养档案工作干部，在建立管理制度和改进业务方法方面取得了一些成绩；但是，很多机关的同志对档案工作的重要作用认识不够，大多数机关的归档制度还没有建立起来，档案的管理不集中，整理方法不统一、不科学，鉴定和销毁还缺少一定的标准和制度。各级机关的档案工作机构大都不健全，工作人员数量少，业务生疏，特别是缺少领导骨干。这些情况就使得一些机关的档案不能得到及时地科学地整理，分散混杂，查找不便，甚至发生无人管理、遗失文件，泄露国家机密和任意销毁文件等现象，造成难以弥补的损失。对于革命历史档案和旧政权的档案，还只是进行了一部分集中管理的工作，绝大部分仍由有关机关代管，由于管理不严，损坏、散失或任意销毁的现象还很严重。至于档案馆工作，尚在开始。为了迅速地加强我国档案工作的管理，适应目前国家机关工作和科学研究工作对于档案资料的迫切需要，国务院特决定：
    一、加强国家档案工作的统一管理。档案工作的基本原则是集中统一地管理国家档案，维护档案的完整与安全，便于国家各项工作的利用。全国档案工作，都应该由国家档案管理机关统一地、分层负责地进行指导和监督。各级机关的档案材料（包括机关的收发文电、内部文书、会议纪录、电话记录、技术文件、出版物原稿、印模、照片、影片、录音等），应该由机关的档案业务机构——档案室——集中管理，不得由承办单位或个人分散保存；各机关的档案和代管的档案，非依规定的批准手续，不得任意转移、分散或销毁，其中需要永久保存的部分，应当按照统一的规定，分别集中到国家的中央档案馆或地方档案馆保管。
    二、全面推行文书处理部门立卷，以建立统一的归档制度。各机关办完的文书材料，应该由文书处理部门整理立卷，定期向机关档案室归档，改变把零散文件随办随归档和成堆归档的错误作法。实行文书处理部门立卷，就可以发挥文书处理部门熟悉有关业务和文件处理过程的优点，提高案卷的质量和立卷工作的效率；就可以由文书处理部门暂时保存本年度的文件，大大减少归档和调卷的手续，并且改变承办人员分散保存文件的现象，从而有利于保守国家机密的工作；同时，还可以使机关档案室腾出手来，做好档案的整理和组织利用等工作，更好地为机关工作服务。目前中央一级和省、自治区、直辖市一级国家机关已经这样做了的，应当注意总结经验，健全制度，巩固成绩，提高工作的效率和质量；还没有这样做的，应当迅速地作好准备，在1956年内全面推行。
    三、迅速整理开国以来的积存档案。各级机关自中华人民共和国成立以来积存的档案，数量是很庞大的。为了便于现在利用和将来向国家档案馆移交起见，各级机关对于本机关的积存档案，都应该进行一次认真的整理，划清永久保存、定期保存和剔出销毁的范围，按照统一的规定，分别进行处理；并且通过这次整理，取得经验，使机关的档案工作制度健全起来。已经集中的原大行政区机关的档案，应该按照已经制定的办法迅速进行整理。中央一级和省、自治区、直辖市一级机关在整理各机关的积存档案和代管的原大行政区机关档案的时候，都应该组织一定的力量，加强领导，大力进行，要求在1956、1957两年内完成。专、县级机关的积存档案也应该着手进行整理。
    四、必须积极收集和清理分散在各地的革命历史档案和旧政权档案。中华人民共和国成立以前的革命历史档案，应该以省为单位进行调查、收集和初步整理，准备交给中共中央档案馆筹备处负责集中整理和保存。各地各单位代管的旧政权档案，除敌伪党、团和特务、警宪等机关的政治档案应该由公安部门组织清理外，都应该在省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会统一领导通盘计划下，由原代管机关负责在1956和1957两年内做好清理和整理工作，同时加强保护，以便将来按照统一规定分别向指定的国家档案馆集中。
    五、国家档案局在加强全面规划工作中，应该充分发挥对全国档案工作的指导和监督的积极作用。为此，必须和各机关在档案工作上取得密切联系，加强调查研究，深入了解情况，有重点地检查各地各机关的档案工作，总结和推广先进经验，并在此基础上迅速拟订档案工作条例，拟订关于归档范围的规定和档案保管期限标准表，建立鉴定和销毁档案的制度，使档案工作迅速走上正轨，迎头赶上国家建设事业的需要。
    六、加强各级档案工作机构。国务院各部、各委员会和各直属机构应该在办公厅（室）之下设立和加强档案室，负责管理本机关的档案；有的部门为了指导和监督本机关档案室的工作和所属系统的档案工作，可以设立档案管理处（或局）。各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会应该在办公厅下迅速设立档案管理处，负责指导和监督各厅、局和省、自治区、直辖市以下各级国家机关的档案工作；各厅、局应该设立档案室，负责管理本机关的档案。专、县级机关和各级企业单位、事业单位和人民团体也应该设立档案室或配备专职干部管理档案。国家档案局应该全面规划，逐步地在首都和各省区建立中央的和地方的国家档案馆。各级档案工作机构，都应该按照工作需要和精简原则，由各级编制委员会迅速确定编制，由人事部门配备工作人员；凡是缺少领导骨干的，必须配备或充实骨干力量。
    七、加紧培养干部、提高档案工作的业务水平和科学水平。今后国家的档案工作干部，除由中国人民大学历史档案系进行培养外，特别应该注意分层负责地开办短期训练班加强在职干部的业务学习，结合实际工作，提高其业务水平。国家档案局和中国人民大学历史档案系对档案学及其他辅助科目，应该加强研究工作，以提高科学水平。各级国家机关应该对现有的档案工作人员进行认真的审查，保证档案工作机构的纯洁性；新调配的工作人员要具有一定的政治水平和文化水平，以便能够较快地学习和掌握档案业务。一切在职的档案工作人员，都应当积极工作，努力学习，争取成为精通档案业务的专业人才。
    档案工作是一项专门业务，又是一项机要工作，但在目前国家机关工作中还是一个比较薄弱的环节，因此各级国家机关的领导人员必须予以足够的重视。机关的办公厅（秘书处、室）必须把档案工作列为经常的重要业务之一，切实加强领导，不断地改进和提高业务水平，使它能在国家的各项建设中发挥应有的作用。
    国务院各部、各委员会和各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会接到这个决定以后，应该迅速进行研究，贯彻执行。
                1956年4月16日
