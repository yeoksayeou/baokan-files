Vice Chairman Zhu De's Speech

Dear Comrade Mikoyan, dear comrades of the Soviet Government Delegation, friends and comrades:

After visiting our country, the Soviet Government Delegation headed by Comrade Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, will return home tomorrow. During the visit, Comrade Mikoyan had sincere talks with Chairman Mao and other Chinese leaders. After discussions, the Chinese government and the Soviet government delegation also signed an agreement on further developing economic cooperation between the two countries. Through this visit of the Soviet government delegation, the close brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has been further strengthened, and the cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in various fields will be more consolidated and expanded.

As we are about to bid farewell to Comrade Mikoyan and other comrades of the Soviet government delegation, we would like to ask them to convey the Chinese people's heartfelt thanks to the Soviet people and to congratulate the Soviet people on every achievement they have made under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government in building a communist society and defending world peace.

Friends, comrades, I propose:

To the health of Comrade Mikoyan and all comrades of the Soviet Government Delegation;
To the close cooperation and brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people;

Cheers!

    朱德副主席的讲话亲爱的米高扬同志、亲爱的苏联政府代表团全体同志、朋友们和同志们：
    以苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬同志为首的苏联政府代表团在我国进行了访问之后，将要在明天回国。在访问期间，米高扬同志同毛主席和中国的其他领导人员作了恳切的谈话。中国政府同苏联政府代表团经过会谈之后，还签订了关于进一步发展两国经济合作的协定。通过苏联政府代表团这次的访问，中苏两国人民亲密无间的兄弟友谊又得到了加强，中苏两国在各方面的合作将更加巩固和扩大。
    在我们即将送别米高扬同志和苏联政府代表团其他同志的时候，我们愿意请他们把中国人民衷心的感谢带给苏联人民，并且代为祝贺苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府领导之下为建设共产主义社会、为保卫世界和平而取得的每一个成就。
    朋友们、同志们，我提议：
    为米高扬同志和苏联政府代表团全体同志们的健康；
    为中苏两国人民的亲密合作和兄弟友谊；
    干杯！
