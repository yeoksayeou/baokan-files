    Spring Light Agricultural Cooperative's Arrangements for Preferential Labor Day Work for Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel
    Huang Gu
    The Spring Light Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suzhuangzi Township, Ji County, Hebei Province, has a total of 849 households and 4,152 people, including 31 households of families of martyrs, 61 households of military families (27 households of military officers, 19 households of volunteer soldiers, and 15 households of conscripted soldiers), and 33 households of demobilized construction soldiers. The cooperative's work regarding preferential treatment adopted methods such as specifically arranging labor, offering preferential labor days, and organizing support groups for military families to replace the previous method of substitute farming.
    The cooperative arranged different types of work for families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled revolutionary soldiers based on their varying physical conditions and ages. The 63 households of families of martyrs and military personnel with labor ability and the 33 households of demobilized construction soldiers were assigned to the technical and heavy labor groups, while those with weaker labor ability were assigned to the light labor group, arranging a total of 29 types of work. With these arrangements, the cooperative's 91 households of families of martyrs, military personnel, and other households in need can complete 2,289 labor days this year. Among them, nine elderly women are responsible for taking care of children, completing 271 labor days throughout the year; six elderly and disabled individuals participate in production activities such as raising chickens, watching fish, and watching domestic rabbits, completing 152 labor days throughout the year; 29 individuals who can only participate in light labor engage in eight types of light labor such as husking corn, pinching millet ears, going to the threshing ground, picking cotton, selecting seeds, hoeing seedlings, weeding, and picking peanuts, totaling 716 labor days this year; and 31 individuals participate in eleven types of production such as raking wheat, watching sweet potato cellars, driving pack animals, raking stones, building dam platforms, driving rollers, watching waterways, accumulating fertilizer, and supporting tripods, totaling 907 labor days throughout the year.
    The cooperative also implemented a method of preferential labor days. The beneficiaries of the preferential treatment are families of martyrs, soldiers' families, and revolutionary disabled soldiers of the second class or above whose labor income is insufficient to reach the living standard of ordinary cooperative members. The calculation method is to use the value of the average labor day of cooperative members throughout the year as the living standard, deduct their own possible income, and the shortfall is subsidized by the entire cooperative from the total income. The number of preferential labor days enjoyed by each household is assessed in the spring. When the settlement is made in the autumn, if their own labor days exceed the originally assessed number, they are not deducted. The cooperative plans to complete 190,933 labor days throughout the year, averaging 46 labor days per person, with each labor day calculated at 2 yuan, 4 jiao, and 4 fen, allowing each person to earn 112 yuan and 4 jiao. Using this living standard to calculate the annual living expenses of the entire family of martyrs and military personnel, and deducting the income from their own labor days, among the 92 households of families of martyrs and military personnel in the cooperative, 23 households with 82 people need to be subsidized with a portion of labor days, and two households with two people need to be fully subsidized, requiring a total of 1,476 labor days, equivalent to 3,601 yuan, 4 jiao, and 4 fen. Calculated in this way, preferential labor days account for 0.776% of the total number of labor days required by the cooperative throughout the year, with an average burden of 0.355 labor days per person per year; assuming that a young adult completes 200 labor days throughout the year, the burden of preferential labor days is only 1.43, equivalent to 3 yuan and 6 jiao, which is lighter than the three substitute farming obligations borne by each labor force in 1955.
    The cooperative's calculation of preferential labor days was the result of repeated research; initially, there were some inappropriate ideas and calculation methods. For example, when initially calculating the income of families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, the calculations were too detailed and the deductions were too tight, including deducting the families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers' grain reserves, production investment principal, labor during primary school students' vacations, labor that daughters might perform when staying at their parents' home, soldiers' sporadic remittances, and their sporadic side occupations such as raising chickens and selling eggs, all as fixed income. Furthermore, when initially calculating the labor days performed by families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, there was also a phenomenon of being detached from reality and overestimating the labor days, such as assigning 60 to 70 labor days to elderly men in their seventies or women burdened with five children. This increased their burden and affected their enthusiasm for production. After research, the cooperative's cadres and members felt that the current work of preferential treatment was no longer limited to solving the living difficulties of families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, but to gradually improve their living standards like everyone else; the original calculation method was inappropriate and did not conform to this spirit. Moreover, when calculating the income of cooperative members, the standard was generally based on labor day dividends, so it would obviously be inappropriate to deduct grain reserves, production investment principal, or income from side occupations only for families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers. At the same time, soldiers' sporadic remittances and the labor of primary school students during vacations or daughters staying at their parents' home are infrequent and unreliable, and should not be regarded as fixed income. The cooperative's cadres and members also felt that helping families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers solve their living difficulties was their due responsibility, and that families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers generally were willing to actively participate in labor. If one point of income were deducted for every point of labor they participated in, it might affect their enthusiasm. Therefore, they felt that in the future, for some individuals with only slight labor ability, such as those whose labor intensity was less than one-quarter of a full labor force, in addition to arranging their production in the same way, they should not be deducted from their own labor days, so that they could use the income from these labor days to improve their lives.
    In order to regularly care for the 26 elderly and weak families of martyrs and military personnel in the cooperative, the cooperative also established eight support groups for military families based on production teams, composed of three to five people, including the welfare committee member, health worker, women's production team leader, and township civil affairs committee member. The scope of work of the support groups for military families is to specifically lead the concrete work of supporting military families within their production team, using the method of holding regular forums to understand the situation of families of martyrs, military personnel, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, and to mobilize and organize team members to help the families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers who are elderly, disabled, orphaned, and young solve difficulties in daily life such as fetching water, burning firewood, and washing clothes. The result of doing this is that everyone is responsible for the work of supporting military families, while avoiding the unreasonable phenomenon of a small number of people taking care of the work and bearing too much burden, which everyone is very satisfied with.

    春光农业合作社对烈属、军属优待劳动日工作的安排
    黄鼓
    河北省蓟县苏庄子乡春光农业生产合作社共有849户，4，152人，其中烈属三十一户，军属六十一户（军官家属二十七户，志愿兵家属十九户，义务兵家属十五户），复员建设军人三十三户。这个社的优抚工作，采用了具体安排劳动、优待劳动日以及组织优属小组等办法，来代替过去的代耕办法。
    烈属、军属和革命残废军人的身体、年龄条件不同，这个社根据他们的不同情况，安排他们参加了不同的劳动。把有劳动力的六十三户烈属、军属和三十三户复员建设军人安排在技术组、重活组参加劳动，把劳动力弱的分配在轻活组，安排了二十九种活。经过这样安排，这个合作社的九十一户烈属、军属和其它困难户，今年就可以做2，289个劳动日。其中有九位老太太负责看管小孩，全年可以做271个劳动日；有六位老人和残废者，分别参加养鸡、看鱼、看家兔等生产活动，全年可以做152个劳动日；有只能参加轻劳动的二十九个人参加剥玉米、掐谷穗、上场、拾棉花、拣种子、薅苗、拔草、拾花生等八种轻劳动，今年总共可以做716个劳动日；还有三十一个人参加搂麦子、看白薯坑、赶驮子、搂石子、打坝台、赶滚子、看水道、积肥、扶三角等十一种生产，全年可以做907个劳动日。
    这个社同时实行了优待劳动日的办法。优待的对象是依靠本身劳动收入还不能达到一般社员生活水平的烈属、士兵家属和二等以上的革命残废军人。计算的方法是以社员全年平均劳动日的所值作为生活标准，扣除他们本身可能得到的收入，不足的部分由全社在总收入里给予补助。每户享受的优待劳动日数目在春天评定。到了秋后结算的时候，如果他们自作的劳动日超过了原来评定的数目，也不扣除。这个社今年规划全年需要做190，933个劳动日，每人平均要做四十六个劳动日，每个劳动日按二元四角四分计算，每人可收入一百十二元四角。拿这个生活标准计算出烈属、军属全家全年的生活费用，扣除了他们自做劳动日的收入以后，全社九十二户烈属、军属当中，需要补助一部分劳动日的有二十三户、八十二人，需要全部补助的有二户、二人，共需要补助劳动日1，476个，折钱三千六百○一元四角四分。这样计算下来，优待劳动日占全社全年所需劳动日总数的0.776％，平均每人全年负担劳动日0.355个；假使按一个青壮年全年做二百个劳动日计算，要负担的优待劳动日只是1.43个，折款三元六角，比1955年每一个劳动力负担三个代耕义务工还轻。
    这个社这样计算优待劳动日是经过了反复研究的；刚开始的时候曾经发生过一些不妥当的想法和算法。比如最初计算烈属、军属、革命残废军人的收入的时候，算得过细，扣得太紧，将烈属、军属、革命残废军人的存粮和生产投资还本，把小学生假期的劳动和女儿住娘家时候可能做的劳动日，把士兵的零星汇款以及他们的零星副业如养鸡、卖鸡蛋等收入，都作为固定收入扣除。又如最初在计算烈属、军属及革命残废军人自做劳动日的时候，也发生过脱离实际、评得过高的现象，如把七十多岁的老头，或是有五个孩子牵累的妇女也评上了六十到七十个劳动日。这样增加了他们的负担，影响了他们的生产积极性。经过研究以后，社的干部和社员都感到，目前的优抚工作不再是限于解决烈属、军属和革命残废军人的生活困难，而是要让他们和大家一样逐步提高生活水平；原先那种计算办法是不合适的，不符合这种精神的。而且在计算社员收入的时候，一般都是以劳动日分红作标准，如果单单对烈属、军属和革命残废军人扣除存粮、生产投资还本或副业收入，显然就不妥当了。同时，士兵零星汇款和小学生假期或女儿住娘家的劳动都是不经常和不可靠的，不应该当作固定收入。社干部和社员也感到：帮助烈属、军属和革命残废军人解决生活困难是自己应尽的责任，同时烈属、军属和革命残废军人一般也都愿意积极参加劳动，假使他们参加一分劳动就扣除一分收入，可能会影响他们的积极性。因此觉得今后对有些仅有轻微劳动能力的，例如劳动强度不足整劳动力四分之一的，除了应该同样地安排他们的生产以外，就不在他们自做劳动日里扣除，使他们能够用这些劳动日的收入来改善生活。
    为了经常照管社内二十六名老弱烈属、军属，这个社还以生产队为单位成立了八个优属小组，由福利委员、卫生员、妇女生产队长和乡民政委员等三至五人组成。优属小组的工作范围是专门领导本生产队内优属的具体工作，用定期召开座谈会的方法，了解烈属、军属和革命残废军人及复员建设军人的情况，并且发动和组织队员帮助残老孤幼的烈属、军属和革命残废军人解决吃水、烧柴、拆洗衣服等日常生活方面的困难。这样做的结果，作到了优属工作人人有责，同时又避免了少数人照管、负担过重的不合理现象，大家都很满意。
