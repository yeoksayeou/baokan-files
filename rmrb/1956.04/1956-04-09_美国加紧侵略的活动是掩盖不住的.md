    The U.S.'s Intensified Aggressive Activities Cannot Be Covered Up

    While the U.S. representative in Geneva is playing its tune of a "statement renouncing the use of force" by both China and the United States, what exactly has the United States been doing in Taiwan? Let's look at some recent examples.

    Not long ago, the United States established the so-called "Taiwan Defense Command" in Taiwan. The "New York Post" admitted that this was "a military step of great significance." It revealed that as a result of this step, the U.S.'s control over Taiwan is "more tightened than ever before," and the U.S. has further strengthened its control over Taiwan. The "Commander" of this "Command" is authorized to conduct military operations not only in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands but also in the coastal islands.

    At the same time, the activities of high-ranking U.S. military officers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the Taiwan area have increased significantly. These activities have clear objectives. For example, on March 19, Harris, the Director of Operations of the U.S. Far East Air Force, and Grant, the "Deputy Commander" of the U.S. "Taiwan Defense Command," conducted activities on Matsu Island, which is close to the Chinese mainland. They not only visited the "exercises" of Chiang Kai-shek's troops but also "looked out at the opposite shore and the terrain of the entire island in the rain and fog." Harris also "inquired" about "which location on the opposite shore is the best landing point."

    On April 4, the new headquarters of the U.S.'s so-called "Task Force Air Force" in Taiwan was established in Taipei. According to reports, the facilities prepared by this headquarters are "capable of accommodating a much larger U.S. Air Force fleet." An Associated Press dispatch from Taiwan revealed, "All indications here suggest that the U.S.'s current policy of defending Taiwan is a long-term policy," and "various circumstances combined prove this increasingly common view."

    The U.S.'s increasingly intensified military activities in the Taiwan area expose the whole story behind the activities of the U.S. representative in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva. It turns out that the U.S. side's purpose in requesting the publication of a so-called "statement renouncing the use of force" is merely to demand that China abandon the exercise of its sovereignty, while giving the U.S. the freedom to use force, so that it can openly occupy other countries' territories and dominate them for a long time. Obviously, doing so cannot lead to the easing of the situation in the Far East but will only exacerbate tensions in the region.

    The Chinese people can never tolerate the U.S. deliberately delaying the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva while strengthening its military control over Taiwan. As pointed out in our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on March 11: "The United States must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from this situation." The U.S.'s attempt to use the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks to cover up its increasingly intensified aggressive activities is futile.

### 美国加紧侵略的活动是掩盖不住的

    美国加紧侵略的活动是掩盖不住的
    当美方代表在日内瓦弹奏着它的由中美双方发表“放弃使用武力的声明”的曲调时，美国在台湾究竟干了些什么勾当呢？且看最近的一些事例。
    不久前，美国在台湾成立了所谓“协防台湾司令部”。“纽约邮报”承认，这是“一项具有重大意义的军事步骤”。它透露，采取这项步骤的结果，美国对台湾的控制“比以前任何时候都更加加紧”，美国进一步加强了对台湾的控制。这个“司令部”的“司令”不但被授权可以在台湾和澎湖地区，并且也可以在沿海岛屿进行军事行动。
    与此同时，美国海陆空高级军官在台湾地区的活动，有了显著的增加。这些活动带有明显的目的。举个例来说，三月十九日，美国远东空军作战署长哈里斯和美军“协防台湾司令部”的“副司令”格兰特，到紧靠着中国大陆的马祖岛进行了活动。他们不但参观了蒋介石部队的“演习”，并且还在“雨雾中了望对岸和全岛地形”。哈里斯还“询问”了“在对岸沿海地区那一地方是最好的登陆地点”。
    四月四日，美国驻台湾的所谓“特遣空军部队”的新的总部，在台北成立了。据报道，这个总部准备的设施，“可供容纳前来规模大得多的美空军机队”。美联社从台湾发出的电讯透露，“这里的一切迹象都显示出：美国目前计划的那种防御台湾的政策是一种长期的政策”，并且从“各种不同的情况凑起来都证明了这种愈来愈普遍的看法”。
    美国日益加紧在台湾地区的军事活动，揭穿了日内瓦中美大使级会谈中美方代表活动的全部底细。原来，美国方面要求发表一个所谓“放弃使用武力的声明”的目的，仅仅是要求中国放弃行使自己的主权，而给美国以使用武力的自由，使它可以公然占领别国领土，并且长期霸占。很明显：这样做决不能导致远东局势的和缓，而只能加剧这个地区的紧张局势。
    中国人民决不能容忍美国一方面在日内瓦中美大使级会谈中故意拖延时日，一方面却加强对台湾的军事控制。正如我国外交部三月十一日声明中指出的：“由于这种情况而产生的一切后果，必须由美国承担全部责任。”美国企图利用中美大使级会谈来掩盖它的日益加紧的侵略活动，是徒劳无益的。
