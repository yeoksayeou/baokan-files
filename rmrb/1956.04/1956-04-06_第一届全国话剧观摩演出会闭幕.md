Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui spoke at the closing ceremony. He pointed out that Chinese drama, based on a rich real life, has become an indispensable and important weapon for promoting the socialist revolution. He hoped that playwrights and drama workers would correctly recognize the shortcomings of formalism and naturalism that have arisen in the development of Chinese drama, and consciously strengthen their political and artistic cultivation, go deep into life, study diligently, and gradually overcome these shortcomings. In his speech, Qian Junrui pointed out that theatrical creation should be further promoted, and theatrical criticism should be widely carried out in the future.
