Construction of the key project of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, from Ganshui Town in Sichuan Province to Guiyang City in Guizhou Province, has commenced. The Liangfengya Tunnel and Xiaoqing Tunnel, the longest tunnels on the entire line, began excavation in early April.

This railway is one of the new railway trunk lines to be built ahead of schedule during the First Five-Year Plan. The railway will cross the Yangtze River and the Wu River, and pass through the treacherous Lou Mountain Pass; it will have to wind its way forward in towering mountains with an altitude of over 2,000 meters above sea level.

    川黔铁路重点工程动工
    从四川省的赶水镇到贵州省贵阳市的川黔铁路重点工程已经动工修建。全线最长的凉风岈隧道和小庆隧道，已经在四月上旬先后动工开凿。
    这条铁路是提前在第一个五年计划期间新建的铁路干线之一。铁路要越过长江、乌江，穿过险要的娄山关；要在拔海二千公尺以上的崇山峻岭中迂回前进。　（本报驻成都记者）
