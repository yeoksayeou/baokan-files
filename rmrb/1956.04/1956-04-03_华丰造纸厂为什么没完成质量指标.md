    Why the Huafeng Paper Mill Failed to Meet Quality Targets
    By our reporter Liu Fan
    Since the publicly-owned Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill launched a struggle against conservative thinking last December, the mill's leaders and workers have become even more enthusiastic about tapping the enterprise's potential and completing the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This year, the production increase targets for cigarette paper and yellow printing paper were increased from 400 tons to 1,050 tons. Thanks to the labor competitions launched by the workers, the value and output plans for January and February were completed ahead of schedule. However, the quality targets for January and February were not met, with cigarette paper averaging 3.59% below standard and yellow printing paper 0.15% below. In the first ten days of March, not only were the quality targets not met, but there were even more quality accidents than before.
    Why couldn't the Huafeng Paper Mill complete its quality plan? The most fundamental reason is that the enterprise leaders lacked a concept of quality. They had mistakenly believed that: 1. Cigarette paper, which accounts for 72.43% of the mill's total output value, was previously subject to production limits. Now that the state requires a large increase in production, it is a contribution to the state to produce as much as possible; 2. The targets for completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule are output value and output, not quality; 3. Although the products did not meet quality standards, defective products still accounted for 90% of the output value. Under the guidance of this leadership thinking, each workshop focused solely on output and disregarded quality in the labor competition. Since the beginning of this year, Workshop One has had eight quality accidents. In order to produce more vats of paper, the shifts and groups in Workshop Two discharged pulp early near the end of their shifts, resulting in a large amount of paper being scrapped.
    Although the leaders of the Huafeng Paper Mill called on workers to improve product quality during the labor competition, they did not repeatedly educate the workers and sincerely rely on the masses to improve product quality. Last year, in the third quarter, the mill launched an effort for workers to make quality record cards, but the technical inspection section felt that the workers' records were not comprehensive and were not reassured. Many workers saw improving product quality as the sole responsibility of the technical inspection personnel. When inspectors discovered unqualified products, workers would argue with them. The "Five Fixes and Four Links" paper-making method, which Workshop Two summarized based on the operating experience of various groups, had a significant effect on improving the quality of yellow printing paper. However, some workers were skeptical of it, saying: "I've been around the wheel for decades and can find problems with my eyes closed"; "I can measure everything with my eyes." The leaders did not criticize these conservative ideas. As a result, the "Five Fixes and Four Links" paper-making method could not be promoted, and the quality of yellow printing paper did not improve.
    Strengthening cooperation between departments can play a significant role in improving product quality, but the mill's work in this area was also poorly done. For example, the supply section often did not send the purchased rice straw to the raw material laboratory for inspection as required, but instead asked the farmers delivering the straw to send it directly to the cutting room. Because the moisture content and quality of the rice straw were not recorded by the laboratory, it affected the correct proportions of the paper pulp raw materials. As a result, the paper pulp was unevenly cooked, the fibers were short, and the paper's folding endurance was insufficient.
    Can the product quality be brought up to standard? Many workers and technicians at the Huafeng Paper Mill believe that it can be. They said that in March 1955, the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry requested the mill to produce 100 tons of yellow printing paper for export. At that time, the workers' technical level and equipment conditions were not better than they are now. However, because the leaders, section personnel, and workers all valued quality and followed technical procedures, the product qualification rate reached 94%. This shows that there is a possibility for the Huafeng Paper Mill to improve quality. After the launch of the labor competition, workers and technicians put forward many methods for improving product quality. For example, Shi Amao, an old worker in Workshop Two, created the "Three-Step Cutting" method for beating paper pulp, which can make the paper pulp fibers fine and long, thereby improving the paper's tensile strength and folding endurance. Wen Deli, the leader of the maintenance team, proposed using "water-absorbing steel pipes" to solve the problem of watermarks on the paper. Technician Ye Jinshui suggested enlarging the diameter of the paper-leading small rollers to eliminate paper wrinkles. Technicians Chen Yuanfu, Yang Changwu, and Dong Yongtai suggested improving the "wire vat" to avoid paper breaks and fish-scale spots on the paper. Unfortunately, not all of these suggestions were adopted. In the struggle against conservative thinking, workers proposed that to solve the defect of paper not being smooth, the calender must be "liberated." The leaders adopted this suggestion, and the smoothness of the paper changed significantly in February. This fact shows that the key to improving product quality at the Huafeng Paper Mill lies in the leadership. As long as the leaders correctly grasp the principle of fast, more, good, and economical, and seek fast and more under the conditions of good and economical, instead of focusing only on fast and more and disregarding good and economical, the potential for comprehensively completing the state plan is endless.

    华丰造纸厂为什么没完成质量指标
    本报记者　刘凡
    公私合营杭州华丰造纸厂，自从去年十二月开展反对保守思想的斗争以后，厂的领导人和职工群众，对挖掘企业潜力，提前完成国家第一个五年计划的积极性更高了。今年卷烟盘纸和黄版纸的增产指标从四百吨增加到1，050吨。由于工人们开展了劳动竞赛，一、二月份都提前完成了产值、产量计划。但是，一、二月份的质量指标没有完成，卷烟盘纸平均差3.59％，黄版纸差0.15％；三月上旬不但没完成质量指标，质量事故比以往更多了。
    华丰造纸厂为什么不能完成质量计划呢？最根本的原因是企业领导人员缺乏质量观念。他们曾错误地认为：一、占全厂产值72.43％的卷烟盘纸过去是限产的，现在国家要求大量增产，因此，只要能多多增产，就是对国家有贡献；二、提前完成五年计划的指标是产值和产量，而不是质量；三、产品虽然没达到质量标准，但是次品还有90％的产值。在这种领导思想指导下，在劳动竞赛中，各个车间就只顾产量、不顾质量。今年以来，一车间共发生质量事故八次。二车间的班、组为了多抢打几缸纸，在快下班的时候提前放浆，结果制出来的纸大量报废。
    在劳动竞赛中，华丰造纸厂的领导人员虽然号召过职工们提高产品质量，但是，没有对职工反复进行教育，认真依靠群众提高产品质量。这个厂去年第三季度曾经发动工人做质量记录卡片，但是，技术检查科认为工人记得不全面，放心不下。许多工人把提高产品质量看成只是技术检查人员的事。检查员发现不合格产品的时候，工人就同检查员争吵。二车间根据各小组的操作经验总结出的“五定四联”抄纸法，对提高黄版纸质量有很大作用。但是，有些工人怀疑它，说：“我围车轮转了几十年，闭着眼睛就能找出毛病”；“我用眼睛就可以测定一切。”对这些保守思想，领导人员没有给予批判。因此，“五定四联”抄纸法没法推广，黄版纸质量就没有提高。
    加强各部门的配合，对提高产品质量会起很大的作用，但是这个厂的这方面工作也做得不好。例如供应科买来了稻草，经常不按规定送原料场化验室检验，就叫送草的农民直接送到切草间。因为稻草的水分和质量没有化验记录，就影响到纸浆原料的正确比例。结果就造成纸浆生熟不匀，纤维短，纸的摺力不够。
    能不能使产品质量达到标准呢？华丰造纸厂的不少工人和技术人员认为是能达到的。他们说：1955年3月，轻工业部造纸工业管理局曾要求该厂生产一百吨出口的黄版纸，那时工人的技术水平和设备条件并不比现在好，但是，因为领导人员、科室人员和工人都重视质量，都按技术规程办事，产品合格率达到94％。这就说明华丰造纸厂提高质量的可能性是有的。开展劳动竞赛以后，工人和技术人员曾提出许多有关提高产品质量的办法。如二车间老工人施阿毛创造打纸浆的“三步落刀”法，可以把纸浆的纤维打得细而长，从而提高纸的拉力和摺力。保全组长闻得利提出采用“吸水钢管”，可以解决纸版上的水纹。技师叶金水建议把引纸小辊筒的对径放大，可以消灭纸的绉纹。技术员陈元富、杨昌务、董永泰曾建议改进“网槽”，可以避免断纸和纸上出现鱼鳞斑。可惜这些建议没有被全部采用。在反保守思想的斗争中，工人们提出要解决纸不光滑的缺点，必须“解放”轧光机，领导人员采纳了这个建议，二月份纸的光滑程度就有了显著的变化。这个事实说明：华丰造纸厂提高产品质量的关键在于领导，只要领导人员正确地掌握快、多、好、省的原则，在好、省的条件下求快和多，而不是只顾快和多，不顾好和省，全面地完成国家计划的潜力是无穷无尽的。
