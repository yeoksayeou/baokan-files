Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    The Field Competition Inspection Team
    The Fuzhou suburban Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative established a competition inspection team in the socialist competition. They regularly delve into various production teams and fields to conduct inspections, promoting the cooperative's production increase movement.
    During the rush to accumulate fertilizer competition, the inspection team discovered that Wang Gansen of the Fifth Production Team was looking for fertilizer sources everywhere. He found a fertilizer pond and dug out more than one hundred loads of fertilizer. The next day, the competition inspection team promoted this experience throughout the cooperative, setting off a "find more fertilizer sources, accumulate more fertilizer" craze in the whole cooperative, with an average daily accumulation of more than two hundred and fifty loads of fertilizer. In the water conservancy construction competition, the Sixth Production Team lacked labor. The inspection team mobilized neighboring production teams to help this team build a drainage channel.
  　
    Strengthening the Strength of Production Teams
    The Sanqiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tulou Township, Yongqing County, Hebei Province, dispatched cooperative management committee members to work in the production teams.
    The cadres of the cooperative's thirteen production teams were weak, and more than thirty cadres with leadership abilities were working in the cooperative. As a result, some teams could not gather people until late in the morning and could not start work. In order to correct this phenomenon, the cooperative transferred thirteen members of the cooperative management committee with leadership abilities to the production teams. After they arrived at the teams, they implemented a work quota system and adopted a piece-rate system. The enthusiasm of the members increased, and they went to work early every day and returned late.
    
    Universally Promote the Method of Holding Field Meetings
    A method of leadership involving in-depth field work and timely resolution of production problems through field meetings is being widely promoted in the agricultural production cooperatives of Sanshui County, Guangdong Province.
    These field meetings are held irregularly by the joint association or cooperative as needed. Participants include the cooperative director, members of the cooperative management committee, production team leaders, and experienced old members. After systematically inspecting production in the field, they promptly solve existing problems and exchange advanced experiences.
    This method of leadership through field meetings was promoted by the Sanshui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party after summarizing the experiences of key cooperatives. This leadership method has reversed the chaotic phenomenon that occurred because agricultural cooperative cadres lacked concrete guidance on production.
    In the past, cadres of the Yangmei Township Agricultural Production Cooperative often held meetings in the office to arrange work, rarely going to the fields to solve problems. Therefore, the production plans they made were rarely implemented. Recently, the cadres of this cooperative, after delving into the fields for inspection, found problems such as drought, flooding, and insect pests affecting the seedlings. They held field meetings on the spot and immediately took measures to save the affected seedlings.

    Timely Correction of Rough Cultivation Phenomena
    After sowing, in order to ensure the quality of cultivation and promptly correct the rough phenomena of spring plowing, the director and deputy director of the management committee and the supervision committee of the Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huangyuan County, Qinghai Province, divided the work to check the cultivation quality of each production team (group). During their in-depth field inspections, they found that some production teams (groups) were cultivating roughly, sowing seeds without picking up grass roots after plowing; some fields had three or four feet of empty space along the edges without sowing; some members plowed the land to depths and widths that did not meet specifications, and individual members secretly carried out old-fashioned farm tools for use. On the one hand, they provided technical tutoring in the evenings to members using new-style farm tools, and on the other hand, they organized production team (group) leaders to visit and compare each other in the fields. Many team (group) leaders checked their own shortcomings of not being strict enough in their requirements and management of team (group) members during the visit. Now, a competition of cultivation quality has been launched between the production teams (groups) of the cooperative. The sections with missing seeds and uneven sowing have been replanted, and the members' skills in using new farm tools have also improved.

    Establish a Quality Inspector System
    The Huangtugang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing suburbs, established a quality inspector system, promoting members to improve the quality of various farm works.
    After the quality inspectors of the eight production teams of the Fenzhuang East Brigade jointly inspected the spring sowing situation of each team, the sowing quality of small radishes and potatoes of the fourth group of the second detachment reached the requirements and became a model for the entire team to learn from. Three groups of the Fenzhuang West Brigade did not cover the chives well with soil. After the inspectors pointed it out, they re-covered them. Chu Xinlin of the first production team of the Baijiayao Production Team sowed potatoes sparsely. After the inspector discovered it in time, he immediately asked him to replant.
    Each production team recommends a quality inspector. This is the method adopted by the Huangtugang Agricultural Production Cooperative to ensure the implementation of this year's agricultural production increase technology measures.

    Formulate Agricultural Technical Operating Procedures
    Recently, the Xingfu Zhi Lu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pangong Township, Xiangfan City Suburbs, issued a "Agricultural Technical Operating Procedures" booklet to each member household. The procedures stipulate the operation process, quality standards, and work efficiency of various agricultural works throughout the year. A reward and punishment system is also stipulated after the operating procedures for each work. After the procedures were announced, the members' cultivation quality improved, and the rough phenomena were overcome. Liu Xinhui, a member who used to only care about earning "work points" regardless of quality, has also changed. In the past, he "hoed the ground like a painted face, with half of the ground skin not hoed." Now, he hoes even the grass next to the wheat roots cleanly.

    具体地领导农业生产
    田间的竞赛检查队
    福州市郊黎明农业生产合作社在社会主义竞赛中，成立了竞赛检查队，经常深入各个生产队和田头进行检查活动，推动了全社的增产运动。
    在突击积肥竞赛中，检查队发现第五生产队王干森到处找肥源，找到一处肥塘就挖出一百多担肥料。第二天竞赛检查队就向全社推广了这一经验，在全社内掀起了“多找肥源、多积肥”热潮，平均每天都积下二百五十多担肥料。在修水利竞赛中，第六生产队劳力不足，检查队便分头发动邻近生产队，帮助这个队修好一条排水渠道。

    增强生产队的力量
    河北省永清县土楼乡三强农业生产合作社派社务管理委员到生产队工作。
    这个社十三个生产队的干部能力很弱，三十多名有领导能力的干部又在社里工作。因此，有些队每天到大半晌还集合不起人，上不了工。为了纠正这种现象，这个社把十三个有领导能力的社务管理委员，分别调到各生产队。他们到队以后，推行了工作定额制，采用了按件记工的办法，社员们的生产劲头大了，每天早早的就上了工，天晚时才收工回来。
    普遍推行召开田头会议的方法
    一种深入田间、及时解决生产问题的田头会议的领导方法，正在广东省三水县的农业生产合作社普遍推行。
    这种田头会议是以联社或社为单位，根据需要不定期召开的。参加会议的有社主任、社务管理委员会的委员、生产队长和富有生产经验的老社员。他们在田间有中心有计划地检查生产以后，及时解决当前存在着的问题和交流先进经验。
    这种召开田头会议的领导方法，是中共三水县委员会总结了重点社的经验加以推广的。这种领导方法，扭转了农业社的干部因为对生产缺乏具体指导而出现的忙乱现象。
    杨梅乡农业生产合作社的干部，过去就是经常在办公室内开会布置工作，很少到田间去解决问题，因此订出的生产计划很少能够贯彻执行。最近，这个社的干部，深入田间检查，发现秧苗受旱、受淹和受虫害的问题以后，就地召开田头会议，立即采取措施，挽救了受害的秧苗。　（新华社）
    及时纠正耕作粗糙现象
    青海省湟源县星火农业生产合作社在播种以后，为了保证耕作质量，及时纠正春耕工作的粗糙现象，社务管理委员会和监察委员会的主任、副主任分工包干检查各个生产队（组）的耕作质量。他们在深入田间检查时发现：有的生产队（组）耕作粗糙，翻地后不拾草根就下种；有的地边上空出三、四尺宽没有播；有的社员犁地的深浅、宽窄不合规格，个别社员偷偷地扛出旧式农具来使用。他们一方面在晚间对使用新式农具的社员进行技术补课，一方面组织生产队（组）长到田间互相参观评比，很多队（组）长在参观时当场检查了自己对队（组）员要求和管理不严的缺点。现在，这个社各生产队（组）之间已经展开了比耕作质量的竞赛，缺种和播种不匀的地段已经补种，社员使用新农具的技术也提高了。　（据新华社讯）
    建立质量检查员制度
    北京郊区丰台区黄土岗农业生产合作社建立质量检查员的制度，推动了社员们提高各项农活的质量。
    份庄东大队八个生产小组质量检查员联合检查了各组春播情况后，使第二分队第四小组小萝卜、土豆播种质量都达到要求，成为全队学习的榜样。份庄西大队有三个小组盖韭菜土没盖好，经检查员指出已经返工盖好。白家窑生产队第一小组楚新林种土豆种得稀，检查员及时发现后，立即要他改种。
    每个生产小组推选一位质量检查员，这是黄土岗农业生产合作社保证贯彻今年农业增产技术措施所采取的办法。　（据新华社讯）
    订出农业技术操作规程
    最近襄樊市郊区庞公乡幸福之路农业生产合作社发给了每户社员一本“农业技术操作规程”。规程中规定了全年各种农业活路的操作过程、质量标准和工作效率，每项活路的操作规程后面还订有奖惩制度。规程公布以后，社员们耕作质量提高了，克服了粗糙现象。一向作活只顾多“挣工分”、不顾质量的社员刘新惠也转变了，过去他“锄的地像花脸，一半地皮不见锄。”现在，连麦根边的草他也都锄得干干净净。（据新华社讯）
