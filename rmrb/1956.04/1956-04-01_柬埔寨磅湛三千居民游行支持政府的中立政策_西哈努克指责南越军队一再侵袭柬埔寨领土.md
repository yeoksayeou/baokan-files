Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - According to a broadcast from Phnom Penh Radio on the 29th, 3,000 people in Kampong Cham held a demonstration on the 25th to support Sihanouk and the neutral policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Participants in the march held banners with slogans such as "Support the neutral policy" and "Willing to follow the neutral policy" and chanted slogans.

When the marching crowd reached the office of the Governor of Kampong Cham Province, they sent a representative to read a suggestion to Prince Sihanouk. The suggestion stated that they were "willing to work hard to defend the neutral policy" and opposed the "improper behavior" of South Vietnam and Thailand towards Cambodia.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 31st - According to a Reuters dispatch from Phnom Penh: Prince Sihanouk, the resigned Prime Minister of Cambodia, issued a statement to the press on March 29, accusing South Vietnamese troops of repeatedly invading Cambodian territory, looting villages, and kidnapping Cambodians.

Sihanouk said in the statement that South Vietnam blocked the border between South Vietnam and Cambodia on February 2 without notifying Cambodia. The Cambodian government has taken retaliatory action and blocked the border on the Cambodian side on March 26.

Sihanouk cited numerous instances in the past three months in which South Vietnamese troops had entered Cambodian territory under the pretext of pursuing South Vietnamese rebels, and pointed out that Cambodia's protests over border incidents between the two countries had not yielded due results.

    柬埔寨磅湛三千居民游行支持政府的中立政策
    西哈努克指责南越军队一再侵袭柬埔寨领土
    新华社河内30日电　据金边电台二十九日广播，磅湛有三千人在二十五日举行示威游行，支持西哈努克和柬埔寨王国政府的中立政策。参加游行的人举着“支持中立政策”、“愿意追随中立政策”等标语，并且高呼口号。
    游行队伍走到磅湛省长办公厅门前时，派了一个代表宣读了一份给西哈努克亲王的建议书。建议书中表示“愿意努力保卫中立政策”，反对南越和泰国对柬埔寨的“不正当行为”。
    新华社河内31日电　据路透社金边消息：已经辞职的柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王三月二十九日向报界发表声明，指责南越军队一再侵袭柬埔寨领土，抢劫村庄，绑架柬埔寨人。
    西哈努克在声明中说，南越在二月二日没有通知柬埔寨就封锁了南越同柬埔寨交界的边界。柬埔寨政府已经采取了报复行动，在三月二十六日封锁了柬埔寨这方面的边界。
    西哈努克举出了过去三个月来南越军队在追击南越反叛者的借口下许多次侵入柬埔寨边境的事例，并且指出，柬埔寨对两国边境事件所提出的抗议也没有得到应有的结果。
