    Deepen Leadership in the Daily Million Ton-Kilometer Movement
    Li Shaoqiang, Cao Junjie, Xu Baosen, Sheng Liande, Crew Members of Changchun Locomotive Depot

    Last year, our crew members from four chartered locomotive groups at Changchun Railway Locomotive Depot proposed to railway workers across the country to strive to complete the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Many railway workers enthusiastically responded to our proposal. To further carry out the socialist competition, we recently proposed the target of daily million ton-kilometers, not only to haul more but also to run faster and better. This advanced target of daily million ton-kilometers is the advanced Soviet experience of comprehensively improving railway transportation capacity. We are determined to implement this experience.

    To carry out the daily million ton-kilometer movement, not only do we locomotive crew members need to work hard, but also workers in various railway departments—transportation, engineering, telecommunications, rolling stock, and other units—need to work together. After we proposed the target of daily million ton-kilometers, many crew members were very enthusiastic. Some drivers have already been able to achieve this target. However, to universally achieve this target, it is necessary to conduct regular, comprehensive leadership and meticulous organizational work. However, the lack of coordination between railway bureaus and between departments is still hindering the healthy development of this movement.

    Currently, there is a bad phenomenon in train connections between railway bureaus. That is, some railway bureaus are not working together for the overall interest but are instead trying to "checkmate" each other. The trains sent by the Harbin Railway Bureau often do not consider the overall interest, but rather to "watch the fun" by sending trains with a traction of 3,000 tons at times, and then trains with 2,400 tons at other times, causing an imbalance in traffic flow. This kind of departmentalism must be thoroughly criticized.

    In addition, implementing named train numbers can allow locomotive crew members to work well, live well, and study well, and can better complete transportation tasks. Named train numbers are also an advanced experience in organizing transportation work. However, the implementation of named train numbers is now infrequent, and even silent. In the future, the implementation of named train numbers should be insisted upon. At the same time, the planning of transportation should be strengthened, the tight operation chart should be earnestly implemented, the imbalance in transportation should be reversed, and the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock should be accelerated, reducing single locomotives and reducing the dwell time of rolling stock. Only in this way can we use locomotives and rolling stock faster, better, and more economically to meet the increasing demands of everyone for railway transportation.

### 深入领导日运百万吨公里运动

    深入领导日运百万吨公里运动
    长春机务段乘务员　李绍强　曹俊杰　徐宝森　盛连德
    我们长春铁路机务段四个包车组的乘务员，在去年向全国铁路职工提出倡议，争取提前完成第一个五年计划期间的任务。许多铁路职工热烈响应了我们的倡议。为了进一步开展社会主义竞赛，最近我们又提出日运百万吨公里的指标，不但要拉得多，而且要跑得快，跑得好。这种日运百万吨公里的先进指标，是全面提高铁路运输能力的苏联先进经验。我们有决心推行这一经验。
    要开展日运百万吨公里的运动，不但需要我们机车乘务员的努力，而且需要铁路各个部门——车务、工务、电务、车辆等单位的职工共同努力。在我们提出日运百万吨公里的指标以后，许多乘务员劲头很大。有些司机已经能够达到这个指标。但是要普遍达到这个指标，需要进行经常的全面领导和细致的组织工作。但是，铁路局和铁路局之间、部门和部门之间互不协调的现象还阻碍着这个运动健康地发展。
    目前各铁路局之间在列车衔接方面有一种不好的现象，这就是有的铁路局不是为了整体利益，共同搞好工作，而是互相“将一军”。哈尔滨铁路分局发来的列车，就往往不从整体利益出发，为了叫你拉不了，“看笑话”，有时候发来牵引三千吨的列车，有时候却发来两千四百吨的列车，造成车流不平衡的现象。对于这种本位主义，必须彻底批判。
    另外，实行记名车次，可以使得机车乘务员工作好、生活好、学习好，能够更好地完成运输任务。记名车次也是组织运输工作的先进经验。但是现在推行记名车次不经常，甚至无声无息了。今后应该坚持实行记名车次。同时，应该加强运输的计划性，认真执行紧密运行图，扭转运输不平衡的现象；加快机车和车辆的周转，减少单机，减少车辆停留时间。只要这样，我们就能更快更好更省地使用机车和车辆，来满足大家对于铁路运输日益增多的要求。
