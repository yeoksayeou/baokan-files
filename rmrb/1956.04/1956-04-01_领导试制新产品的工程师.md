    Engineer Leads Trial Production of New Products
    Zhou Zong is an engineer at the Refractory Materials Workshop of Chongqing No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant. In recent years, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, he has led workers in successfully trial-producing a variety of new refractory materials products, saving funds and creating conditions for extending the life of metallurgical furnaces.
    In 1954, the Refractory Materials Workshop successfully trial-produced semi-silica bricks. The price of raw materials used for semi-silica bricks is much lower than that used to manufacture clay bricks. In 1955, the plant saved more than 200,000 yuan in raw material costs due to the use of semi-silica bricks. In 1954, the Refractory Materials Workshop also successfully trial-produced high-alumina bricks. After using high-alumina stopper bricks on the steel ladles of the plant's steelmaking workshop, the problems of steel running and steel leakage were basically solved, and the life of the furnace roof could be extended.
    In August 1955, the Refractory Materials Workshop successfully trial-produced spalling-resistant magnesia bricks. This refractory material has a porosity of less than 20%, high slag resistance, and compressive strength, and is particularly resistant to rapid temperature changes. The successful trial production of spalling-resistant magnesia bricks has created extremely favorable conditions for strengthening the metallurgical process and is an important contribution to the science of steelmaking technology.
    Thanks to the efforts of Comrade Zhou Zong, the Refractory Materials Workshop has also made significant achievements in promoting the advanced experience of rapid firing. Now, the firing time of clay bricks in this workshop has been shortened from the original 85 hours to 54 to 60 hours, and the kiln turnover period has also increased from three times a month to four and a half times.

    领导试制新产品的工程师
    周宗是重庆第一钢铁厂耐火材料车间的工程师。几年来，他根据苏联专家的建议，领导职工试制成功了多种耐火材料的新产品，节省了资金，并且给延长冶金炉的寿命创造了条件。
    1954年，耐火材料车间试制成功了半矽砖。半矽砖所用的原料价格要比原来制造粘土砖所用的低得多。1955年这个厂因为使用半矽砖所节约的原料费就达二十多万元。1954年耐火材料车间又试制成功了高铝砖。这个厂炼钢车间的盛钢桶上使用高铝质塞头铸口砖后，基本上解决了跑钢、漏钢问题，并且可以延长炉顶寿命。
    1955年8月，耐火材料车间又试制成功了耐崩裂性镁砖。这种耐火材料的气孔率在20％以下，有很高的抗渣性和耐压强度，特别是能耐温度的急遽变化。耐崩裂性镁砖的试制成功，给强化冶炼过程创造了极为有利的条件，是对炼钢技术科学上一个重要的贡献。
    由于周宗同志的努力，耐火材料车间在推广快速烧成先进经验方面也取得显著成绩。现在，这个车间粘土火砖的烧火时间已经由原来85小时缩短为54至60小时，窑炉周转期也由每月三次增加到四次半。
