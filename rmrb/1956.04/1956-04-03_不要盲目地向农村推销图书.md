    Do Not Blindly Promote Books in Rural Areas
    Chen Dao
    With the arrival of the socialist upsurge in the countryside and the development of the Party's propaganda and education work, the number of popular readings and children's books published and distributed has increased significantly, which is a welcome phenomenon.
    However, recently, some places have been blindly promoting books without considering the real needs of readers. In some places, there has even been a disguised form of forced allocation, wasting state financial resources, increasing the burden on the people, and affecting the consolidation of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the development of agricultural production. This has created a very bad political impact and should be taken seriously.
    The library of an agricultural producers' cooperative in Chenxiang Township, Shanghai County, recently purchased two hundred yuan worth of books. The Qinjian Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Duxing Township is a newly merged cooperative with very little public welfare funds. The Xinhua Bookstore Shanghai County branch also allocated 150 yuan worth of books and delivered them to the cooperative. The cooperative initially did not want these books, but after the bookstore's "mobilization," it had to buy a portion for 106 yuan, some of which were translated novels. No one in the cooperative manages the books, there are few readers, and the political effect is poor.
    On February 10th this year, the Wuxi Municipal Education Bureau and the Xinhua Bookstore Wuxi Branch jointly issued a "Notice on Arranging the Subscription of Reading Materials and Extracurricular Reading Materials and Teaching Reference Books for Primary School Students," stipulating that each primary school student must purchase four or five "reading materials," and the cost of the books should be paid by the students' parents. "If a small number of students have real financial difficulties, students with better financial conditions can be mobilized to help each other voluntarily." The Jiangsu Branch of Xinhua Bookstore highly appreciated this approach and notified all county branches and outlets to learn from it, "generally promote it in cities," and rural branches "can try it out in central primary schools and complete primary schools first, and then promote it comprehensively after gaining mature experience," in order to "achieve remarkable results simultaneously." Some branches responded actively. A certain county only has 36,000 students, but the county's branch is also preparing to use the above-mentioned methods and other methods to distribute 500,000 copies of children's books this year.
    In the high tide of socialist construction, the enthusiasm of the people for learning culture has greatly increased, and the need for books has indeed been and is continuing to grow. Publishing and distribution workers should try their best to meet their real and reasonable needs. In the past, many publishing and distribution workers had right-leaning conservative ideas, failed to see the growing need of the people for books, and published too few books, especially popular readings for farmers and children's books, resulting in a situation where supply fell short of demand. Even the published books were not well distributed to the readers who needed them. This situation still exists in many places and should be overcome. However, after opposing right-leaning conservative ideas, some publishing and distribution workers do not conscientiously and deeply investigate the real needs of readers. They only have an empty and abstract concept of "the need is greatly increasing" in their minds. They want to distribute a large number of any kind of book, and blindly send any kind of book to the lower levels. As for whether the masses buy it, whether anyone reads it after buying it, and what the effect is after reading it, they don't care at all. This subjective approach is very harmful.
    Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "No one can think wildly without basis, and no one can plan his actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances. Do not reluctantly do things that are really impossible." It is a fact that the cultural life needs of the peasant masses are increasing day by day. However, on the other hand, it must also be seen that many agricultural producers' cooperatives have only been established for a short time, and their foundations are not very solid. Even if they have a little capital, they should first use it to purchase means of production and expand reproduction. Only when agricultural production develops can various tasks such as culture, education, health, and sports in rural areas advance accordingly. It is inappropriate to require farmers to spend too much money on other aspects at present. Rural clubs and libraries should be established in a planned, step-by-step, and prepared manner, and books should be added gradually. Do not ask farmers to take out a large amount of money to buy books at one time. Distribution agencies at all levels must regularly conduct in-depth investigations into the real needs and purchasing power of readers, overcome blindness in their work, and ensure that the distribution of books and periodicals is in line with objective circumstances. It is certainly not good to have an insufficient supply of reading materials for farmers; it is also wrong to blindly promote books and newspapers to farmers, exceeding their actual needs and economic strength, and affecting the consolidation of cooperatives and the development of agriculture. We suggest that local party committees strengthen their leadership and supervision over distribution agencies, and require them to arrange their work realistically based on the overall situation in rural areas, avoiding both being passive and conservative and blindly distributing books.

    不要盲目地向农村推销图书
    陈道
    随着农村社会主义高潮的到来和党的宣传教育工作的开展，通俗读物和少年儿童读物的出版发行数量大量增加，这是一种可喜的现象。
    但是最近某些地方已经发生不问读者的真实需要状况，盲目地推销图书的现象，个别地方甚至又出现变相的强迫摊派，浪费了国家的财力，增加了人民的负担，影响了农业生产合作社的巩固和农业生产的发展，在政治上造成很不好的影响，应该引起严重的警惕。
    上海县陈巷乡的一个农业生产合作社图书室，最近购置了二百元的图书。杜行乡的勤俭农业生产合作社，是一个刚从小社合并建立起来的社，公益金很少，新华书店上海县支店也给它配了150元的图书送上门去。该社起初不要这些书，经过书店“动员”，才不得不用106元买了一部分，其中有一些是翻译小说。该社没有人管理图书，读者不多，政治效果差。
    无锡市教育局和新华书店无锡支店今年二月十日发出了一个叫做“布置订阅小学学生阅读教材和课外读物及教学参考书工作”的联合通知，规定每个小学生都必须购买四本或五本“阅读教材”，书费由学生家长交付，“少数学生经济条件确有困难，可发动经济条件比较好的学生自愿互助”。新华书店江苏分店很赞赏这个办法，就通知各县支店和门市部学习，在城市中“普遍参照推行”，农村支店“先在中心小学、完小试行，俟取得成熟经验后，可全面推广”，以便“齐头并进地取得显著成绩。”有些支店积极响应。某县只有三万六千个学生，县的支店也准备用上面说的办法和其他办法在今年发行少年儿童读物五十万册。
    在社会主义建设的高潮中，人民群众学习文化的积极性大大提高，对于图书的需要确实已经并且正在继续增长。出版发行工作者对于他们的真实的合理的需要应该尽可能地予以满足。过去许多出版发行工作者有右倾保守思想，看不到人民群众对于书籍需要的增长状况，许多图书特别是农民通俗读物和少年儿童读物出版得太少，以致供不应求；就是已出版的图书，也没有很好地发行到需要它的读者手中去，这种情况在许多地方仍然存在，应该注意克服。但是，在反对了右倾保守思想以后，有些出版发行工作者不去认真地深入地调查读者的真实需要状况，脑子里只有一个“需要大大地增长”的空洞抽象的概念，什么书都想大量发行，什么书都盲目地向下面送，至于群众是否买，买了以后是否有人读，读了以后效果怎样，一概不加过问。这种主观主义的作法，是十分有害的。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。”农民群众的文化生活需要日益增长，这是事实。但是，另一方面也必须看到，许多农业生产合作社才建立不久，底子还不很厚实，即使有一点资金，首先要用于添置生产资料，扩大再生产。只有农业生产发展，农村中文化、教育、卫生、体育等各项工作才能相应地前进。目前就要农民过多地把资金消耗在其他方面，是不妥当的。农村俱乐部和图书室应该有计划地有步骤地有准备地建立，图书应该逐渐增添，不要一次就要农民拿出一大笔资金买书。各级发行机构必须经常地深入调查读者的真实需要和购买力，克服工作中的盲目性，使书刊发行切合客观情况。农民读物供应不足，固然不好；向农民盲目地推销书报，超过农民的实际需要和经济力量，影响合作社的巩固和农业的发展，也是不对的。我们建议各地党委加强对于发行机构的领导和监督，要求它们根据农村全般情况，实事求是地安排工作，既不要消极保守，也不要盲目发行。
