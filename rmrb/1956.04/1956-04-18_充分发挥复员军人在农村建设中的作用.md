Fully Utilize the Role of Demobilized Soldiers in Rural Construction
Jian Min De Yong

Editor's Note: In recent years, batches of demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers have returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production and other rural work. These demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers have not only made great contributions to the country and the people in the revolutionary war, but also have a certain level of policy understanding and working ability. The rural grassroots party organizations in various places should unite and educate them, and fully utilize their role in rural construction. However, at present, some grassroots organizations often only see their individual shortcomings, but not their advantages. Therefore, in their work, they adopt discriminatory and exclusive attitudes towards them; in their lives, they also lack necessary care and consideration. This is not right. The party branch of the Limin Agricultural Cooperative in Qin County, Shanxi Province, has not only ensured the unity of the party and the people outside the party, but also made remarkable achievements in the cooperative's production and work because it correctly solved this problem.

Demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers who return to their hometowns to participate in production are an important force in the countryside. These people have received long-term education and training from the Party, and have been tempered by revolutionary war and revolutionary work. Their political and ideological awareness is relatively high, and they have a certain working ability. As long as the rural Party organizations unite them well, they can fully utilize their core role in agricultural cooperation and the movement to increase agricultural production. The achievements made by the Party organization of the Dongpo Limin Cooperative in Duancun, Qin County, Shanxi Province, in uniting and educating demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers is a clear example.

From the establishment of the Limin Cooperative, the Party organization of this cooperative realized that fully utilizing the role of demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers was an important condition for running the cooperative well. Among the thirteen party members in this cooperative, four are demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers; among the eleven cooperative cadres, five are demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, and they all hold important positions such as the president, vice president, and supervisor. Although these party members and cadres have relatively high political and ideological awareness, they also have some more serious shortcomings. For example, Wei Linxiu, a revolutionary disabled soldier and Communist Party member, was a hero in the army who killed the enemy. After returning to his hometown, he became complacent and looked down on the cadres in the township, and did not participate in Party meetings. Li Sanwen, a demobilized construction soldier, also often bragged in front of the masses that he had seen and heard a lot, and even scolded the cadres in the township for no reason. Obviously, if these erroneous thoughts and behaviors are not criticized and corrected, not only will it be impossible to give full play to the positive role of demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, but it will also affect the unity between party members and the unity between the Party and the masses. Therefore, the Party organization of the Limin Agricultural Cooperative, on the one hand, organized all party members to study the eight issues of the standards of a Communist Party member and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, and criticized the complacency and other thoughts of the demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers; on the other hand, it cared about their lives and helped them solve the difficult problems in their lives. In this way, not only did it help the demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers to realize the mistake of complacency, but it also made them feel the warmth of the Party, thus changing their past arrogant attitude and actively approaching the Party organization. For example, after the Party branch analyzed the situation of Li Fulin, a revolutionary disabled soldier and Communist Party member, it understood that the reason why Li Fulin was passively not working was mainly because he was afraid that his wife, Wei Gouhai, would divorce him; at the same time, he also had some difficulties in his life. Therefore, the Party organization educated his wife, Communist Party member Wei Gouhai; Wei Gouhai not only expressed that she would not divorce, but also showed more concern for Li Fulin. In this way, Li Fulin actively participated in production with peace of mind, and was later elected as the vice president of the cooperative. Since then, as long as demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers returned to the township, Li Fulin would take the initiative to use his own experience of being cared for and taken care of by the Party organization to educate these people. Li Fulin became a powerful assistant to the Party organization in uniting and educating demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers. Hu Zhide, who had served as a company instructor in the army, had just returned to his hometown with his wife and wife's younger brother, and the Party organization took the initiative to send people to help him repair his house and buy food. Hu Zhide was very moved. He said: "The Party organization and the government treat me like their own son. If I don't work hard, how can I be worthy of the Party organization and the government?"

The Party organization also paid attention to educating the party members and cadres in the township to unite demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers. After seeing the complacency and other shortcomings of the demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, a few party members and cadres in the township adopted incorrect attitudes. Some ignored them, and some deliberately made things difficult for them. In particular, some cadres with complacency mistakenly believed: "They are stronger than us in fighting at the front, but they may not be better than us in leading the cooperative." The Party organization criticized this thinking and sentiment that was not conducive to unity, pointing out that although demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers still have many shortcomings, as long as they are educated by the Party and helped by everyone, they can overcome their shortcomings and become good party members and good cadres. Therefore, the correct attitude should be to learn from each other and make progress together, and should not be unconvinced and despise each other.

After such education and persuasion unified the thinking and understanding of the entire party, the Party organization properly assigned their work according to the abilities and strengths of the demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers. When they encountered difficulties in their work, the Party organization gave them various specific assistance. For example, when the cooperative was first established, it was attacked by the spontaneous forces of capitalism, and Wei Linxiu, the president and revolutionary disabled soldier, therefore developed a sense of retreat. The Party organization immediately educated him, explaining that it was not surprising that the spontaneous forces attacked the cooperative, and as a leader, he should lead everyone to fight against this spontaneous force. After the crops in the community were hit by a wind disaster, Li Fulin, the vice president of the cooperative and a revolutionary disabled soldier, felt a little discouraged. At this time, the Party organization encouraged him and other cooperative cadres to lead the members to find ways to overcome the disaster. Under the enthusiastic care and help of the Party organization, the work enthusiasm of the demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers in this cooperative became higher and higher.

More than three years have passed. In these three years, the Limin Cooperative has achieved increased production year after year. The yield of grain per mu has increased from 170 jin in 1953 to 306 jin in 1955, and the income of the members has increased by an average of one time. After the upsurge of cooperativization arrived, this agricultural cooperative has been transformed into an advanced cooperative. It should be said that the achievement of these results is inseparable from the work of the Limin Agricultural Cooperative Party organization in closely uniting demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers.

    充分发挥复员军人在农村建设中的作用
    建民　德勇
    编者按：近几年来，有成批的复员建设军人和革命残废军人回乡参加农业生产和农村的其他工作。这些复员建设军人和革命残废军人不仅在革命战争中对国家和人民有过很大的贡献，并都具有一定的政策水平和工作能力。各地农村党的基层组织应该团结和教育他们，充分挥发他们在农村建设中的作用。但是目前有些基层组织往往只看到他们的个别缺点，看不到他们的优点，因而在工作中，对他们采取歧视、排斥的态度；在生活上，对他们也缺乏必要的关怀和照顾。这是不对的。山西沁县利民农业社党支部由于正确地解决了这个问题，就不但保证了党内外的团结一致，而且使合作社的生产和工作都取得了显著的成绩。
    回乡参加生产的复员建设军人和革命残废军人，是农村中的一支重要力量。这些人因为经过党的长期教育和培养，受过革命战争和革命工作的锻炼，政治思想觉悟都比较高，并且具有一定的工作能力。只要农村党组织很好地团结他们，就能充分发挥他们在农业合作化和农业增产运动中的核心作用。山西沁县端村东坡利民合作社党组织，在团结和教育复员建设军人和革命残废军人方面所取得的成绩，就是一个明显的例子。
    从利民合作社建立的时候起，这个合作社的党组织认识到，充分发挥复员建设军人和革命残废军人的作用，是办好合作社的一个重要条件。在这个合作社的十三个党员中，就有四个是复员建设军人和革命残废军人；在十一个合作社的干部中，就有五个是复员建设军人和革命残废军人，并且都担负着社长、副社长和监委等重要职务。这些党员、干部虽然政治思想觉悟都较高，但也存在着一些比较严重的缺点。例如，革命残废军人、共产党员卫林秀是部队的杀敌英雄，回乡以后，居功自傲，看不起乡里的干部，不参加党的会议。复员建设军人李三文也在群众面前经常吹嘘自己见的多，听的多，甚至借故谩骂乡里的干部。很显然，这些错误的思想和行为如不加以批评纠正，不仅不能发挥复员建设军人和革命残废军人的积极作用，而且会影响党员之间的团结，党和群众之间的团结。因此，利民农业合作社党组织，一方面组织全体党员学习了共产党员标准的八个问题和党的七届四中全会决议，对复员建设军人和革命残废军人中的居功自傲等思想进行了批判；另一方面，十分关心他们的生活，帮助他们解决生活中的困难问题。这样，不但帮助复员建设军人和革命残废军人认识到居功自傲的错误，而且使他们感觉到了党的温暖，因而改变了过去的傲慢态度，积极主动地靠近党组织。例如，党支部在分析了革命残废军人、共产党员李富林的情况以后，了解了李富林所以消极不做工作，主要是怕爱人卫苟孩同他离婚；同时他生活上也有点困难。于是党组织就对他爱人、共产党员卫苟孩进行了教育；卫苟孩不但表示不离婚，而且对李富林表现了更加关心。这样，李富林就安心地积极地参加生产，后来还被选为合作社副社长。从此，只要有复员建设军人和革命残废军人回到乡里，李富林就主动地用自己亲身受到党组织关怀和照顾的事实来教育这些人。李富林成了党组织团结教育复员建设军人和革命残废军人的有力助手。在部队任过连队指导员的胡之德，刚一带着爱人和妻弟回到乡里，党组织就主动地派人帮助他修房子，买粮食。胡之德很受感动。他说：“党组织和政府对我就像对待亲儿子一样，我再不好好工作，怎么对得起党组织和政府。”
    这个党组织还注意对乡里的党员、干部进行了团结复员建设军人和革命残废军人的教育。乡里有少数党员、干部看到复员建设军人和革命残废军人的居功自傲等缺点以后，采取了不正确的态度，有的不理睬他们，有的故意同他们为难；特别是一些有自满思想的干部还错误地认为：“他们在前方打仗比咱强，领导合作社可不一定胜过咱们。”党组织批判了这种不利于团结的思想情绪，指出复员建设军人和革命残废军人虽然还有着不少缺点，但是只要经过党的教育，大家的帮助，是可以克服缺点，而成为一个好党员和好干部的。因此，正确的态度应该是互相学习，共同进步，而不应该互不服气，互相轻视。
    经过这样的教育说服，统一了全党的思想认识以后，党组织就根据复员建设军人和革命残废军人的能力和特长，妥善地分配了他们的工作。当他们在工作中碰到困难的时候，党组织给他们以各种具体的帮助。例如，合作社刚建立起来，就遭到了资本主义自发势力的进攻，社长、革命残废军人卫林秀因此产生了退缩情绪。党组织就立即对他进行了教育，说明了自发势力对合作社的进攻是不奇怪的，作为一个领导者，应当领导大家去同这种自发势力斗争。社里的庄稼遭到风灾以后，合作社副社长、革命残废军人李富林有些泄气。这时，党组织就鼓励他和其他社干部，带领社员设法战胜了灾害。在党组织这样热情的关怀和帮助下，这个合作社的复员建设军人和革命残废军人的工作积极性就越来越高。
    时间已经过去三年多了。在这三年多的时期内，利民合作社连年都获得了增产，粮食亩产量已由1953年的170斤提高到1955年的306斤，社员的收入平均增加了一倍。合作化的高潮到来以后，这个农业社已经转为高级合作社。应当说，这些成绩的取得是同利民农业合作社党组织紧密团结复员建设军人和革命残废军人的工作分不开的。
