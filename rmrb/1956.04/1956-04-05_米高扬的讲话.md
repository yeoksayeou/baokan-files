Comrade Chairman Ho Chi Minh: Comrades and friends, residents of Hanoi:
	On behalf of the Soviet government and people, I extend my greetings to you—comrades and friends, representatives of all freedom-loving Vietnamese people.
	I sincerely thank the people of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the warm welcome they have given us and for gathering here to express the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Vietnamese and Soviet peoples.
	The Vietnamese people's struggle against colonialism shows that people who rise up to fight for the freedom and independence of their motherland are bound to win. In their struggle against an enemy equipped with modern weapons, the Vietnamese people gradually liberated their sacred homeland. Their hatred of colonialism and their boundless love for their motherland have multiplied their strength many times. With the noble aim of liberating themselves from the shackles of colonialism, the Vietnamese people valiantly fought against the colonialists.
	The long and arduous struggle was made possible by the leading role of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the role played by other political parties and mass organizations in the Vietnam Fatherland Front. The great role played by the Vietnam Workers' Party, led by President Ho Chi Minh, and the Vietnam Fatherland Front lies in the fact that the Party and the government led the Vietnamese people along the correct path of freeing themselves from colonial and feudal rule and establishing a democratic regime in North Vietnam.
	The struggle for national independence by the freedom-loving Vietnamese people has been recognized by the people of all countries in the world. This recognition was concretely realized at the 1954 Geneva Conference, which ended the bloody war in Indochina and recognized the rights of the peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to independence, unity, and territorial integrity. The sincere support and assistance given by the freedom-loving people of all countries around the world to the noble national liberation struggles of the people of Indochina contributed greatly to the success of the Geneva Conference. The countries participating in the conference, especially the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, made significant contributions to the success of the conference. The resolutions of the Geneva Conference were a major victory for the forces of peace.
	Since the restoration of peace after the Geneva Conference, we are very pleased to see the many changes that have taken place in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in a short period of time in restoring the national economy and improving the living conditions of the people.
	The assistance of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries demonstrates their deep sympathy for the heroic Vietnamese people who have made many sacrifices and suffered great losses in the liberation struggle.
	We believe that the hardworking and talented Vietnamese people, who have shown their strength in the liberation struggle, will victoriously heal the wounds of war and achieve great successes in developing their national economy, developing culture, raising living standards, and restoring the unity of their motherland through peaceful and democratic means.
	As everyone knows, the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by President Ho Chi Minh, visited the Soviet Union last summer. This visit was a clear expression of the unshakable friendship between the people of our two countries.
	The visit of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam further promoted cooperation between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. This cooperation is based on the unshakable friendship and common interests of the people of our three countries who love creative and peaceful labor and fight to defend world peace.
	We accepted President Ho Chi Minh's invitation and took this opportunity to visit your beautiful country, to have close contact with you, to meet those who are actively working for national and social causes, and to meet you here, all dear friends.
	You, dear friends, and we are seeing and participating in the major events that are currently taking place in the world. Thanks to the consistent peaceful policy pursued by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist camp, there has been some easing of world tensions. In the international arena, practical prospects have emerged for resolving outstanding international issues in a relatively satisfactory manner through peaceful consultations, based on the principles of peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are fully in line with the spirit of such international relations. Due to major changes in the world, such as the emergence of the socialist state system, the establishment of vast peaceful regions, and the consolidation and growth of progressive and peace-loving forces around the world, there is now a real possibility of preventing war in the current era.
	One of the most important features of the historical development of the current era is the shameful collapse of the colonial and imperialist system. Many countries previously enslaved by imperialists have now overthrown colonial rule. Our great common friend, the powerful People's Republic of China, is steadily advancing on the historically significant road of socialist transition. The people of other major countries, such as the great Indian people, as well as the people of Burma, Indonesia, and Egypt, after shaking off the shackles of colonialism, are now consolidating their national independence and contributing to the liberation movement of other colonies and dependent countries.
	Since the victory of the October Revolution, the great Soviet people, following the teachings of Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, have been constantly supporting the just struggles of the oppressed peoples for their liberation and firmly opposing all forms of enslavement.
	The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union once again emphatically stressed Lenin's peaceful foreign policy and emphatically stressed support for the desire of those people who want to completely overthrow colonial rule and strengthen and consolidate their national independence and sovereignty.
	All the Vietnamese people, from north to south, are eager to see their country restored to unity as soon as possible. Despite the suppression and terror of the South Vietnamese government, the Vietnamese people have been constantly struggling for democratic freedom and for the realization of national unification through the universal elections stipulated in the Geneva Accords.
	The reactionary forces, supported by the aggressors, are deliberately obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and undermining the Geneva Accords. This is the only way they can manage to drag South Vietnam into the aggressive bloc of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. These aggressive blocs, including the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military aggressive bloc, are threatening the security of the people of Asian countries and other parts of the world.
	The main schemers of these aggressive blocs are conspiring to use these aggressive blocs as tools for imperialist and colonialist countries to oppress economically backward Asian countries in new ways. Everyone, especially the people of Asian countries, is aware of this. Therefore, it is no accident that several major countries in Asia not only condemn these blocs and refuse to participate in them, but are also fighting to eliminate them. We hope that the newly established countries in the territory of Indochina will not allow themselves to be dragged into these blocs, and will participate in the peace zone.
	In this situation, the Vietnamese people's struggle is of even greater significance, because they are fighting for the reunification of the country, demanding the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords, guaranteeing peace, and opening up the possibility for the people of the Indochina region to advance towards the road to self-determination.
	We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, who are the masters of their own destiny and have previously made valuable contributions to maintaining peace, under the leadership of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the glorious Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Vietnam Fatherland Front, will certainly realize their aspirations—to achieve the reunification of their country through peaceful and democratic means. Certainly, the Vietnamese people will soon eradicate the remnants of the colonial system and rapidly make their country prosperous. The Soviet people express their warm friendship to you, comrades and friends, and sincerely hope that you will achieve success in building a new life, in further restoring and developing industry and agriculture, in carrying out democratic reforms, and in improving the material and cultural standards of the people.
	Long live the heroic Vietnamese people!
	Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!
	Long live the unshakable friendship between the people of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union!
	Long live world peace! (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 米高扬的讲话

专栏：

    米高扬的讲话胡志明主席同志：同志们和朋友们：河内全体居民：
    我代表苏联政府和人民，向你们——同志们和朋友们、全体爱好自由的越南人民的代表致敬。
    我诚恳地感谢越南民主共和国首都的人民给予我们热烈的欢迎以及集合在这里表示越南人民和苏联人民之间的兄弟般的友谊和合作。
    越南人民对殖民主义进行的斗争表明，起来为他们祖国的自由和独立而斗争的人民是一定能赢得胜利的。越南人民在他们对有新式武器装备的敌人进行的斗争中，逐步解放了他们神圣的祖国。他们对殖民主义者的仇恨和对祖国的无限热爱，使得他们的力量增加了许多倍。越南人民怀着把他们自己从殖民主义桎梏下解放出来的崇高目的英勇地进行了反对殖民主义者的斗争。
    由于越南劳动党的主要作用和越南祖国战线中的其他政治党派和群众组织所起的作用，使得长期和艰苦的斗争有可能获得了胜利。以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党和越南祖国战线所起的伟大的作用在于党和政府领导越南人民沿着使自己摆脱殖民和封建统治、在越南北方建立民主政权的正确道路前进。
    爱好自由的越南人民的争取民族独立的斗争，得到了全世界各国人民的承认。这种承认在1954年日内瓦会议上具体实现了，这次会议结束了印度支那血腥战争并且承认了越南、老挝和柬埔寨各国人民的独立、统一和领土完整的权利。世界各地的爱好自由的各国人民对印度支那各国人民崇高的民族解放斗争所给予的衷心支持和帮助，使得日内瓦会议获得成功。参加会议的国家，特别是中华人民共和国和苏联，对会议的成功作了重大的贡献。日内瓦会议的决议是和平力量的一次重大胜利。
    自从日内瓦会议后和平恢复以来，我们很高兴地看到了越南民主共和国在一个短短的时期内，在恢复国民经济和改善人民的生活条件方面所发生的许多变化。
    中华人民共和国、苏联和人民民主国家的援助，表现了它们对在解放斗争中作了许多牺牲和受了重大损失的英勇的越南人民的深厚同情。
    我们相信，在解放斗争中显示了他们的力量的勤劳的和有才干的越南人民将胜利地医治战争创伤，并且在发展他们的国民经济、发展文化、提高生活水平和通过和平的和民主的方法恢复他们的祖国的统一方面获得巨大的成就。
    大家都知道，以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团在去年夏季访问了苏联。这次访问是我们两国人民之间不可动摇的友谊的明白表示。
    越南民主共和国政府代表团的访问进一步促进了越南民主共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国之间的合作。这种合作是以我们三国热爱创造性的与和平的劳动并且为保卫世界和平而斗争的人民的不可动摇的友谊和共同利益为基础的。
    我们接受了胡志明主席的邀请，趁这个机会来访问你们的美丽的国家，同你们进行密切的接触，会见那些积极为民族和社会事业而工作的人们以及在这里会见你们，所有的亲爱的朋友们。
    你们，亲爱的朋友们，和我们正在看到并且参加目前正在世界发生的重大事件。由于苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营中其他国家一贯执行的和平政策，世界紧张局势有了一些缓和。在国际方面，已经展开了可能通过和平协商，根据属于不同政治制度和社会制度的国家和平共处的原则，以比较满意的方法来解决悬而未决的国际问题的实际的前景。和平共处五项原则是完全符合这种国际关系的精神的。由于世界上发生了像社会主义国家体系的出现、广大和平地区的建立、全世界进步的爱好和平的力量的巩固和增长这样一些重大的变化，现在已经有了在目前时代防止战争的实际可能性。
    目前时代的历史发展的最重要的特点之一，是殖民主义和帝国主义制度的可耻的崩溃。以前被帝国主义者奴役的许多国家，现在已经推翻了殖民统治。我们伟大的共同的友邦、强大的中华人民共和国，正在具有历史意义的社会主义过渡的道路上稳步前进。其他主要国家的人民，像伟大的印度人民以及缅甸、印度尼西亚和埃及的人民，在摆脱了殖民的枷锁以后，现在正在巩固他们的民族独立，对其他殖民地和附属国的解放运动作出贡献。
    自从十月革命胜利以来，伟大的苏联人民遵从苏维埃国家的建立者列宁的教导，一直在不断支持被压迫各国人民为解放自己而进行的正义斗争，并且坚决地反对一切形式的奴役。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会再次着重地强调列宁的和平外交政策，着重地强调支持那些要完全推翻殖民统治、要加强和巩固他们民族独立和主权的人民的愿望。
    从北方到南方的全体越南人民都渴望看到自己的国家早日恢复统一。尽管南越政府进行压制和恐怖活动，越南人民一直不断地在进行争取民主自由、争取通过日内瓦协定规定的普选实现全国统一的斗争。
    在侵略者支持下的反动势力蓄意阻挠用和平方法实现越南的统一，而且破坏日内瓦协定。这是他们能够设法把南越拉进东南亚条约组织侵略集团的唯一方法。这些侵略集团，包括东南亚条约组织军事侵略集团在内，正威胁着亚洲和世界其他地区各国人民的安全。
    这些侵略集团的主要策划者正在阴谋利用这些侵略集团作为帝国主义和殖民主义国家以新的方式压迫经济上落后的亚洲国家的工具。所有的人，特别是亚洲各国人民，都觉察到这一点。因此，亚洲的几个主要国家不但谴责这些集团和拒绝参加它们，而且正在为消除这些集团而斗争，这并不是偶然的。我们希望在印度支那领土上新成立的几个国家将不让自己被拖进这些集团，而且参加和平地区。
    在这种情况下，越南人民的斗争就更具有重要意义，因为他们争取的是实现国家的重新统一，要求正确的执行日内瓦协定、保证和平和为印度支那地区的各国人民打开向自决道路前进的可能性。
    我们坚决认为，成为他们自己命运的主人的越南人民以前曾对维护和平作出了有价值的贡献，他们在越南民主共和国政府、光荣的越南劳动党和越南祖国战线的领导下，一定会实现他们的愿望——通过和平和民主的方法来实现他们国家的重新统一。肯定地，越南人民会很快地铲除殖民主义制度的残余和迅速地使他们国家繁荣起来。苏联人民向你们，同志们和朋友们，表示热烈的友谊，并且衷心希望你们在建设新的生活中，在进一步恢复和发展工农业方面，在实现民主改革和改善人民的物质和文化水平方面，获得成就。
    英雄的越南人民万岁！
    越南民主共和国万岁！
    越南、中华人民共和国和苏联人民之间的不可动摇的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！　（据新华社讯）
