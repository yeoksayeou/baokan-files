    Building Electric Irrigation Areas
    Jiangsu Province in Wujin, Jiading, Nantong, Taixian, Yancheng, Jiangdu and other places have started construction of electric irrigation areas. Most of these electric irrigation areas are self-managed by agricultural cooperatives, with state subsidies. Currently, members of the agricultural cooperatives in each irrigation area are building irrigation canals.
    After the completion of the electric irrigation projects before rice transplanting this year, the electric irrigation area in Jiangsu Province will expand from 550,000 mu to 800,000 mu. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Diverting Yellow River Water to Irrigate Farmland
    This year, Shandong Province will install 167 siphon projects along the Yellow River in Heze, Liaocheng, Tai'an, Huimin, and Jinan. Upon completion of all projects, 4.1 million mu of farmland can be irrigated. At the same time, cargo ships weighing dozens of tons can travel on the Grand Canal and Xiaoqing River, which have suffered from insufficient water for many years. Sixteen construction projects have already started.
    From 1952 to the present, Shandong Province has built twelve siphons along the Yellow River.

    Ten Million Mu of Cultivated Land Can Eliminate Drought
    As of early April, Hubei Province has built more than 1,800 small reservoirs and more than 580,000 small ponds and weirs. Coupled with irrigation facilities from the past few years, about 10 million mu or more of cultivated land in the province can completely eliminate drought this year.
    Currently, most of the ponds and reservoirs are full of water. In order to strengthen project management and water storage and conservation work, the Hubei Provincial Department of Water Resources dispatched five inspection teams to Xiangyang, Huanggang and other regions in early April to inspect and accept the projects.
    The number of reservoirs built this year in the province is more than 60% higher than the total number of reservoirs built in the past five years since liberation. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Turning Saline-Alkaline Land into Fertile Fields
    A large-scale drainage project is under construction near Yinchuan in the Yellow River Plain in northern Gansu Province. This drainage project is more than 47 kilometers long. Twenty-six bridges, culverts and other structures will be built on the main drainage ditch, and three branch ditches and 323 branch ditches, small ditches and other drainage systems will be built on both sides like veins.
    After the completion of this drainage project, the area where surface water can be drained and groundwater levels can be lowered will reach 344,000 mu, of which the degree of salinization of 250,000 mu of cultivated land can be greatly reduced, and more than 90,000 mu of lakes and wasteland that cannot be cultivated due to salinization will be transformed into fertile fields.

    兴修水利
    兴建电力灌溉区
    江苏省武进、嘉定、南通、泰县、盐城、江都等地开工兴建电力灌溉区。这些电力灌溉区多数是农业合作社自办的，由国家加以补助。现在，各灌溉区的农业合作社社员正在兴修灌溉渠道。
    今年插秧以前的电力灌溉工程完工以后，江苏省电力灌溉区将由过去的五十五万亩扩大到八十万亩。　　　　　（据新华社讯）
    引黄河的水灌溉农田
    山东省今年将在黄河沿岸的菏泽、聊城、泰安、惠民及济南市安装虹吸管工程167道。全部工程完成后，可灌溉农田四百十万亩；同时在多年水量不足的运河、小清河上可以行驶载重几十吨重的货船。目前已经有十六道建筑工程开工。
    从1952年到现在，山东省在黄河沿岸已经建成了十二道虹吸管。

    一千万亩耕地可以消灭旱灾
    截至四月上旬，湖北省已经建成小型水库一千八百多座，小型塘堰五十八万多处。加上过去几年来的灌溉设施，全省约有一千万亩以上的耕地今年可以完全消灭旱灾。
    目前绝大部分塘堰和水库都灌满了水。为了加强工程管理和蓄水保水工作，四月初，湖北省水利厅已派五个检查组到襄阳、黄冈等专区去检查和验收。
    今年全省修筑的水库，比解放五年来修水库的总和还要多60％以上。　　　　　（据新华社讯）
    将盐碱化田变成良田
    甘肃省北部黄河平原银川附近正在动工兴建一个大型的排水工程。这个排水工程全长四十七公里多。在排水干沟上要兴修桥梁、涵洞等建筑物有二十六座，两旁还要像脉络一样兴修三条支干沟和323条支沟、小沟等排水系统。
    这个排水工程完成后，可以排除地面水和降低地下水位的面积达到三十四万四千亩，其中有二十五万亩耕地的盐碱化程度可以大大降低，有九万多亩湖泊和因盐碱化而不能耕种的荒滩将变成良田。
