To the Editorial Comrades:

After the "Reader's Letter Page" published a letter on March 5th entitled "Preventing Impact on Material Exchange in the Socialist Transformation of Rural Private Merchants," the CCP Lukou Town Committee of Liling County and the Lukou Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized relevant personnel for serious discussions and restudied the State Council's decision on several matters concerning the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Currently, the shortcomings in the work have been corrected.

In order to change the phenomenon of crowding caused by blindly merging stalls, the Lukou Town industrial and commercial departments have appropriately increased some retail outlets based on market conditions. For example, the original vendors were organized to add thirteen stalls in streets, alleys, and main traffic routes, and seven additional basket-carrying mobile salesmen were added. This has made it very convenient for residents to purchase goods.

The Lukou Town industrial and commercial departments have also paid attention to maintaining and developing the original operating characteristics of private merchants and peddlers, inviting them to serve as advisors for organizing sources of goods or continuing to do purchasing work. For example, mats are a commodity needed by the masses, which were not previously handled by the supply and marketing cooperative but were purchased from other places by private merchants; now, the cooperative store, with the help of the original private merchant purchasing personnel, has purchased a batch from Honghu, Hubei. Up to mid-March, the original private personnel were allowed to find old connections to purchase goods 43 times, bringing back 129 kinds of goods that had been out of stock or were about to be out of stock. This not only changed the phenomenon of reduced commodities in the previous period but also increased the variety of commodities.

In addition, the Lukou Town industrial and commercial departments, based on the current situation of farmers being busy with spring plowing, organized 55 shoulder-pole peddlers to deliver goods to agricultural cooperatives and farmhouses far from the town, supporting farmers in their efforts to boost production. In addition, two peddlers were dedicated to serving farmers' cultural learning, delivering 91 yuan worth of cultural supplies to farmers in the six days from March 15th to 20th. A member of an agricultural cooperative composed a folk song to welcome the peddlers, singing: "Delivering goods to the door is a really good thing; saves labor and increases production, yielding a thousand catties per mu."

Because the Lukou Town leading organs accepted the criticism of the Party newspaper and earnestly improved their work, a new atmosphere has emerged in the market. The turnover of many stores has begun to rise: the fourteen grocery stores in mid-March increased by 61.1% compared to the beginning of the month; the turnover of the dried and preserved goods store also increased by 13.2%; the overall turnover of the district cooperatives in mid-March increased by 26.5% compared to the beginning of the month.

### 接受群众批评，切实改进工作  渌口镇市场出现了新气象

    接受群众批评，切实改进工作
    渌口镇市场出现了新气象编辑同志：
    三月五日“读者来信专页”发表了“在改造农村私商的工作中应该防止影响物资交流的现象”一信以后，中共醴陵县渌口镇委和渌口镇供销合作社组织有关人员进行了认真的讨论，并且重新学习了国务院关于目前私营工商业的社会主义改造中若干事项的决定。目前，工作中的缺点已经得到了纠正。
    为了改变盲目合并摊贩而造成的群众购货拥挤的现象，渌口镇工商部门已经根据市场情况适当增设了一些零售门面，例如组织了原来的摊贩在街头巷尾和过路要口增加了十三个货摊，另外还增设七个提篮子的流动推销员。这就使居民群众购货感到很方便。
    渌口镇工商部门还注意了保持和发扬原来私商小贩的经营特点，请他们当组织货源的顾问或继续做采购工作。例如，席子是群众需要的商品，过去供销社没有经营，而由私商向外地去采购；现在合作商店已经在原来私商采购人员的帮助下，从湖北洪湖买回了一批。到三月中旬为止，先后让原来私方人员向外找老关系购货四十三次，把已经脱销和即将脱销的商品先后购回来129种。这样，不但改变了前一个时期商品减少的现象，而且使商品品种增加了。
    此外，渌口镇工商部门根据目前农民忙于春耕生产的情况，组织了五十五副货郎担到农业社和离镇较远的农家去送货上门，支援农民加劲搞生产；另外有两个货郎担是专为农民学文化服务的，在三月十五日到二十日六天中已经把价值九十一元的文化用品送到了农民手里。一个农业社社员编了一首山歌唱着欢迎货郎担说： “把货送上门，真是好事情；省工多生产，每亩打千斤”。
    由于渌口镇领导机关接受了党报批评切实改进工作，市场上已经出现了新的气象。许多门市部的营业额都开始上升：十四个杂货门市部在三月中旬比上旬上升61.1％；南货门市部营业额也上升13.2％；各区社三月中旬整个营业额比上旬上升26.5％。
