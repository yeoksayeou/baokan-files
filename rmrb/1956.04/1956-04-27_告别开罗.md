    Farewell to Cairo
    Feng Zhidan
    On April 16th, the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation concluded its visit to Egypt, bid farewell to Cairo, and flew to the Republic of Sudan on the banks of the Blue Nile.
    Recalling our stay in Egypt for over a month is very exciting. During these days, dozens of five-star red flags and three-star green flags fluttered on the Nile Palace Bridge. Three delegations from Beijing, approximately 150 Chinese people, were visiting Egypt simultaneously. This is an unprecedented grand occasion in the history of Sino-Egyptian people's exchanges.
    Beside the Nile River Bridge stands a "Tiananmen"-style gate, which is the Commodity Exhibition Hall of the People's Republic of China. Every day, five to six thousand Egyptians walk through this gate. On April 1st, the exhibition hall held a grand opening ceremony. Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade of our country, said in his speech at the opening ceremony: The Chinese Commodity Exhibition held in Cairo "symbolizes a further development of our two countries' economic and cultural cooperation." Ashraf, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce of the Egyptian government, said on behalf of Minister of Industry and Commerce Nuseir: "Today, everyone will be able to see a great commodity exhibition hall, where we will see that the People's Republic of China has not only carried out an ideological revolution, but also an industrial revolution. All of this is for the prosperity of mankind and world peace."
    The exhibition hall displays more than 3,000 exhibits. These include heavy-duty machine tools, power machinery, textile machinery, and agricultural machinery; various daily necessities, colorful fabrics and silks, and Chinese native products; and exquisite handicrafts and embroidery. A delicate wool embroidery of the pyramids aroused great interest among the Egyptians. In the past half a month, about 100,000 Egyptians have visited the Chinese Commodity Exhibition. Many Egyptians left their messages of praise for the exhibition in the commemorative album. An Egyptian student wrote: "In the Chinese pavilion, I saw the dignity of the East, the giant of the East has stood up."
    These days, Cairo excitedly received the Chinese trade delegation. Cairo's Arabic newspapers cheered for the trade negotiations between Minister Ye Jizhuang of our country and Minister Nuseir of the Egyptian Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Local newspapers frequently reported the news that the People's Republic of China would purchase more Egyptian cotton. When we visited the Sabasi cotton spinning factory, Mr. Spahi, the factory owner, pointed out his soon-to-be-completed new factory building. He said that he hoped these new factory buildings would be able to install Chinese textile machines, and he was convinced that economic exchanges between China and Egypt would become more and more frequent.
    The friendly visit of the Cultural and Art Delegation of the People's Republic of China to Egypt won great welcome from the Egyptian people. The art troupe performed a total of eighteen shows in Egypt, and also visited the famous historical sites and industrial and agricultural construction of Egypt.
    Once, on the way back to Cairo from Alexandria, the Chinese artists rested by the side of the road, and happened to meet a group of medical students. They were hiking from Cairo to Alexandria. When they discovered the Chinese artists, they immediately surrounded them and insisted on singing a song and playing a tune. Our artists played the Dombra and blew the reed flute, and an Egyptian male student danced to the music. Another student excitedly said: "Imperialism is trying its best to alienate Egypt, China, and India, but now they are powerless, and power is in the hands of the Chinese, the Egyptians, and the Indians. Imperialists can no longer separate us."
    We visited an ancient religious university in Cairo—Al-Azhar University. This school has a thousand years of history and has more than 10,000 students from various countries in the East. The principal told me: "When I visited various countries in the East, I visited your industrial exhibition, but I would like to know more about China, and I very much hope to visit your country in person one day." He sincerely hoped for the strengthening of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Egyptian people.
    I will not forget our delegation's visit to the Egyptian Liberation Province. Lieutenant Colonel Hassani, the governor of the Liberation Province, warmly welcomed us and said: "I am very happy to be able to see the representatives of our Eastern relatives—the Chinese people—come here. I hope that this friendly exchange between our two countries can be developed eternally."
    We made a week-long trip to Upper Egypt. The train carried us through the towering pyramids, through the dense sugarcane fields, through the valleys and deserts. After visiting a corner of Thebes, the ancient Egyptian capital, in Luxor, we continued south to Aswan, the gateway to southern Egypt. We arrived at noon, when the sun was all over the green Aswan, and many Boy Scouts lined up at the station to welcome us, chanting "Aswan pays tribute to China!"
    In Aswan, several hydraulic engineers accompanied us to visit the hydroelectric power station and drainage tunnel they were building. Egyptian engineers introduced that the Aswan Dam was built 55 years ago and can store 5 billion cubic meters of water, but under British colonial rule, the hydraulic power here has never been used for half a century, and now they are starting to use the hydraulic power here.
    At a welcome tea party in Aswan, Malaos, the head of the Aswan Cultural District, gave a welcome speech: "Please tell the Chinese people that there is a friendly country on both sides of the Nile. This country has infinite respect and friendship for the Chinese people."
    During the visit of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation to Egypt, the friendship between the two peoples was also manifested in mutual artistic exchanges. Our artists not only introduced the artistic achievements of the Chinese people to the Egyptian people, but also learned some Egyptian songs and dances in just seven days. In the later stage of the delegation's performance, the appearance of those Egyptian art programs was warmly welcomed by the Egyptian audience. Egyptian friends said: "You are the first foreign art troupe to perform our Egyptian songs and dances." One night, more than 300 Egyptian artists also specially held an Egyptian song and dance party for the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation.
    Cultural exchanges between China and Egypt will be further developed due to the visit of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation to Egypt. On the eve of the delegation's departure from Egypt, the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Cooperation Agreement, which marks the further strengthening of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, was signed. This is a major event in the history of relations between the two countries. Hussein, the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Minister of Education of the Egyptian Government, said at the signing ceremony: "After the Bandung Conference, China and Egypt began to establish new relations. At the Bandung Conference, we demonstrated a common goal, that is, to defend peace, freedom, and strive for the dignity of all mankind - regardless of country, religion, or race." Bao Erhan, the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China, pointed out in his speech at the signing ceremony, "Facts show that the colonialists' attempts to split and isolate the friendly cooperation between the people of Asian and African countries are doomed to fail, and the path of the people of China and Egypt towards the comprehensive restoration of historical relations cannot be blocked by any colonialists and their accomplices!"

    告别开罗
    冯之丹
    四月十六日，中国文化艺术代表团结束了在埃及的访问，向开罗告别，飞往青尼罗河畔的苏丹共和国去了。
    回忆我们逗留埃及的一个多月的时间是非常令人兴奋的。这些天里，在尼罗宫大桥上飘扬着数十面五星红旗和三星绿旗。有三个来自北京的代表团，大约一百五十个中国人同时在埃及访问。这在中埃两国人民交往史上还是空前的盛况。
    在尼罗河的桥畔有一座“天安门”式的大门，这是中华人民共和国的商品展览馆。每天有五六千个埃及人走进这座大门。四月一日，展览馆举行隆重的开幕式。我国对外贸易部叶季壮部长在开幕式上致词说：中国商品展览会在开罗举行，“象征着我们两国经济和文化合作的更进一步的发展。”埃及政府工商部副部长艾什雅蒂代表工商部长努赛尔致词说：“今天，大家将能看到一个伟大的商品展览馆，我们将在这里看到中华人民共和国不仅进行了思想上的革命，而且也进行了工业上的革命。这一切都是为着人类的繁荣和世界和平。”
    展览馆内陈列着三千多种展览品。其中包括重型的工具机、动力机以及纺织机和农业机械；包括各种日用品、彩色繁多的布匹绸缎以及中国的土特产；包括精致的手工艺品及刺绣。有一幅金字塔的精致毛绣引起埃及人很大的兴趣。半个多月来约有十万埃及人参观了中国商品展览会。许多埃及人在纪念册上留下了他们对展览会的赠言。一个埃及学生写道：“在中国馆内，我看到了东方的尊严，东方的巨人站起来了。”
    这些天里，开罗兴高采烈地接待了中国贸易代表团。开罗的阿拉伯文报刊为我国叶季壮部长同埃及工商部努赛尔部长间的贸易谈判而欢呼。此地的报刊经常报道着中华人民共和国将要更多地购买埃及棉花的消息。当我们访问萨巴西棉纺厂时，厂主斯巴黑先生曾经指给我看他的即将落成的新厂房。他说，他希望这些新的厂房将能够安装中国的纺织机，他确信中埃两国的经济交流会一天比一天频繁起来。
    中华人民共和国文化艺术代表团在埃及的友好访问，博得了埃及人民的巨大欢迎。艺术团在埃及共演出了十八场，并且还参观和访问了埃及的名胜古迹以及工农业的建设。
    有一次，在从亚历山大回开罗的途中，中国的艺术家们在公路旁休息，正巧遇到一群医学院的学生。他们是从开罗到亚历山大去远足的。当他们发现中国的艺术家时，便立即包围拢来，坚请唱一支歌，奏一支曲。我国的艺术家奏起了冬不拉和吹起芦笛，一个埃及男学生随着乐声起舞。另一个学生兴奋地说：“帝国主义竭力想离间埃及、中国和印度，但是现在他们已无能为力了，权力已掌握在中国人手里、埃及人手里和印度人的手里，帝国主义者不能再分隔我们了。”
    我们曾访问过开罗的一个古老的宗教大学——艾资哈尔大学。这个学校已经有一千年历史了，有一万多个来自东方各国的学生。校长对我说：“当我在东方各国访问时，我曾参观过你们的工业展览会，但我还想对于中国知道得更多些，我很希望有一天亲自访问你们的国家。”他衷心地期望中埃两国人民的友好合作的加强。
    我将不能忘记我们代表团在埃及解放省的访问。解放省省长哈萨尼中校热情地欢迎我们，他说：“我非常高兴能够看到我们东方的亲戚——中国人民的代表到这里来。我希望我们两国间的这种友好的交往能够得到永恒的发展。”
    我们在上埃及作了一个星期的旅行。火车载着我们驰过巍峨的金字塔，驰过密密的甘蔗田，驰过河谷和沙漠。我们在拉克索参观了古埃及的京城底比斯的一角以后又继续南下，到了埃及南方的门户——阿斯旺。我们是在中午抵达的，那时阳光铺满了绿色的阿斯旺，许多童子军列队在车站上欢迎我们，欢呼着“阿斯旺向中国致敬！”
    在阿斯旺，好几个水利工程师陪同我们去参观他们兴建中的水电站和排水的隧道。埃及的工程师们介绍说，阿斯旺的水坝建于五十五年以前，能够存放五十亿立方公尺的水，但是在英国的殖民统治下，半个世纪从来都未曾利用过这里的水力，现在他们开始要利用这里的水力了。
    在阿斯旺的一个欢迎茶会上，阿斯旺文化区负责人马劳斯致欢迎词说：“请你们告诉中国人民，尼罗河两岸有一个友好的国家。这个国家对中国人民怀着无限的崇敬和友情。”
    在中国文化艺术代表团访问埃及期间，两国人民的友谊也表现在相互的艺术交流中。我国的艺术家们不仅向埃及人民介绍了中国人民的艺术成就，而且他们在短短的七天中就学会了一些埃及的歌和舞蹈。在代表团演出的后期，那些埃及艺术节目的出现受到埃及观众热烈欢迎。埃及的朋友们说：“你们是第一个外国艺术团表演了我们埃及的歌舞。”有一天晚上，三百多个埃及艺术家也特地为中国文化艺术代表团举行了一次埃及的歌舞晚会。
    中埃两国的文化交流将由于中国文化艺术代表团的访问埃及获得进一步的发展。在代表团离开埃及的前夕，标志着两国友好合作关系进一步加强的中埃两国文化合作协定签订了。这是两国关系史上的一个重大的事件。埃及共和国政府全权代表、埃及政府教育部长侯赛尼在签字仪式上说：“万隆会议后，中埃两国开始建立了新的关系。在万隆会议上我们表现了目标的一致，那就是保卫和平、自由和争取全人类——不分国家、宗教、种族——的尊严。”中华人民共和国政府全权代表鲍尔汉在签字仪式上的致词中指出，“事实表明，殖民主义者企图分裂和隔离亚非国家人民的友好合作的想法是注定要失败的，中埃两国人民走向全面恢复历史关系的道路，也是任何殖民主义者及其帮凶所阻挡不了的！”
