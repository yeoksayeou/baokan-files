    The so-called "Aid" of the United States to Pakistan
    Li Gao
    At the Manila Treaty Organization conference in Karachi, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles boasted that the U.S.'s "military and economic assistance" had "significantly helped" countries participating in the Manila Treaty, and he even insisted that these countries had "made considerable progress" in "economic development."
    Dulles is indeed an expert in bragging with his eyes closed. Because just before the Karachi conference—on March 2nd, the Pakistani Foreign Minister, Chaudhri, said in a broadcast: "The greatest danger facing our country and other backward countries that participate in the Baghdad Pact and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization alliance together is increasing economic difficulties and poverty."
    Let us now take Pakistan as an example to see how the "aid" given by the United States has actually "helped" the recipient countries. From 1951 to 1955, the United States promised Pakistan approximately $400 million in "military assistance" and "economic assistance." As a condition for the "aid," Pakistan was forced to sign a military "assistance" agreement with it, ignoring the Pakistani people's desire for peace and national interests, and participated in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact group. In this way, Pakistan was forced to undertake more and more military obligations. Not only did it have to use the US "aid" it received for military purposes, but it also had to pay more and more military expenses from its fiscal budget. According to the recently passed budget, Pakistan's military expenditure in 1956-1957 was 900 million rupees, which was 100 million rupees more than in 1955-1956, and more than 200 million rupees more than in 1954-1955. Military expenditure accounted for 70% of Pakistan's fiscal expenditure. Obviously, when a country spends more than two-thirds of its expenditure on non-productive military aspects, it is impossible to carry out any large-scale economic construction, and it will inevitably lead to the deterioration of fiscal and economic conditions.
    Perhaps the United States' so-called "economic assistance" can always bring benefits to Pakistan? The answer is still no. The purpose of this so-called "economic assistance" was stated very clearly in a report published in June 1955 by the Hoover Commission, which studied US foreign aid policy, guiding the US's "overseas economic activities": US "aid" and "investment" to countries in the "arc of Asia and Africa" "should not engage in industrial plans," and should mainly only be used in agriculture and handicrafts. This means that the "aided" countries cannot be industrialized, but should continue to maintain their status as agricultural countries and raw material exporting countries, or to put it more precisely, to maintain these countries' economies as appendages to the American militarized economy, becoming markets for the United States to dump surplus products and objects for plunder. Over the years, the United States and Pakistan have signed 67 implementation agreements on economic and technical "assistance," of which 76% of the "assistance" is used in agriculture, and there is almost no "assistance" for developing industry. US private investment in Pakistan is mainly invested in occupying Pakistan's important resources such as oil, and there is no interest in establishing Pakistan's national industry, especially in establishing heavy industry.
    Under the cover of "aid," the profits obtained by American companies in Pakistan are surprisingly high. In the fall of 1955, the incident of American companies colluding with the U.S. "International Cooperation Administration" (the agency in charge of foreign aid work in the United States) to contract the Karnafuli Hydropower Station project in East Bengal Province, Pakistan, to seek huge profits aroused strong opposition from public opinion in Pakistan. Pakistani engineering circles pointed out that if this project were contracted to Pakistani domestic companies, the cost would be reduced by about 37%. Pakistan's "Today's News" reported on June 16, 1955, that foreign companies invested 80 million rupees in Pakistan and remitted back 35 million rupees in profits in 1954 alone. In May 1955, the United States also signed an agreement with Pakistan stipulating many special "guarantees" for Pakistan to favor American investment. At that time, the "Pakistan Times" pointed out that this agreement would cause more serious blows to Pakistan's national industry and cause the danger of further interference in Pakistan's internal affairs.
    Has Pakistan's agriculture at least been "helped" by the United States? You can imagine it just by seeing this fact: In addition to military supplies, the rest of the US "aid" to Pakistan over the years has mainly been paid for with surplus agricultural products. Cotton is one of Pakistan's main agricultural products and also one of its main exports. In 1955, just when Pakistan's own cotton exports were experiencing difficulties, the United States forced Pakistan to accept $22.4 million worth of American cotton. Moreover, these cottons were also transported to Japan, West Germany and other places, processed into cotton fabrics and imported into Pakistan, hitting Pakistani cotton farmers and the young textile industry. Pakistan's markets for selling cotton in Japan, Western Europe and other places are everywhere suffering from fierce competition from US "aid" cotton and cotton exported with subsidies from the US government. Foreign exchange earned from Pakistan's cotton exports was more than 980 million rupees in 1950-1951, but fell to more than 330 million rupees in 1954-1955, a loss of two-thirds. Jute is also one of Pakistan's main agricultural products and exports. It has also been hit by the US price reduction policy in the international market and has continued to fall in price.
    Jute and cotton account for about 80% of Pakistan's total exports. Because of this kind of "help" from the United States in this regard, Pakistan's export trade has been declining linearly since 1951, when it began to receive US "aid". According to a report in the "Pakistan Times" on September 30, 1955, Pakistan's total export value exceeded 2.5 billion rupees in 1950-1951, but fell to more than 1.1 billion rupees in 1954-1955, a decrease of 54%. This has resulted in Pakistan's international balance of payments imbalance, currency devaluation, and soaring prices. In June 1955, Pakistan's gold and foreign exchange reserves were about one-half less than in 1951. On August 1 of the same year, Pakistan was forced to devalue the rupee by 30%. As a measure to alleviate the domestic cotton and hemp industry crisis, the cotton and hemp planting area in Pakistan has also been restricted.
    This is the actual situation of the "economic development" that Dulles boasted about that the US "aid" brought to the recipient countries. It is precisely because of this that despite Dulles' self-promotion, the US policy of organizing military blocs and predatory "aid" has aroused increasing dissatisfaction and opposition among the people of Pakistan and other countries participating in US military blocs.

    美国对巴基斯坦的所谓“援助”
    李高
    在马尼拉条约国家举行的喀喇蚩会议上，美国国务卿杜勒斯吹嘘说，美国的“军事和经济援助”，“明显地帮助了”参加马尼拉条约的国家，他还硬说这些国家在“经济发展”方面“取得了可观的进展”。
    杜勒斯的确是一个闭着眼睛吹牛的专家。因为就在喀喇蚩会议前夕——三月二日，巴基斯坦外交部长乔德里在一次广播中说：“摆在我们国家以及一起参加巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织联盟的其他落后国家面前的最大危险，是日益增加的经济困难和贫穷。”
    我们现不妨就以巴基斯坦为例来看一看美国所给予的“援助”究竟怎么样“帮助了”受“援”国家。从1951年到1955年，美国答应给巴基斯坦的“军事援助”和“经济援助”约有四亿美元。作为“援助”的条件，巴基斯坦被迫同它签订军事“援助”协定，不顾巴基斯坦人民的和平愿望和民族利益，参加了东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约集团。这样，巴基斯坦被迫承担了越来越多的军事义务。它不但要把它所接受的美“援”用到军事方面，而且还不得不从财政预算中支付越来越多的军事费。据最近通过的预算，巴基斯坦在1956—1957年的军费开支为九亿卢比，比1955—1956年度又多一亿卢比，比1954—1955年度多两亿余卢比。军费占了巴基斯坦财政支出的70％。显然，当一个国家把它的开支的三分之二以上用于非生产性的军事方面，它就不可能进行任何大规模的经济建设，而且必然招致财政和经济状况恶化的结果。
    也许美国的所谓“经济援助”总能够给巴基斯坦带来好处吧？答复仍旧是否定的。关于这种所谓“经济援助”的目的，在1955年6月美国研究援外政策的胡佛委员会所发表的一个指导美国“海外经济活动”的报告中说得非常清楚：美国对“亚非弧形地带”各国的“援助”和“投资”，“不应从事工业计划”，主要只能用在农业、手工业方面。这就是说，不能够让受“援”国工业化，而应当使它们继续保持农业国和原料输出国的地位，或者说得更确切些，是保持这些国家的经济为美国军事化经济的附属体，成为美国倾销剩余产品的市场和进行掠夺的对象。几年来，美国和巴基斯坦签订了六十七项关于经济和技术“援助”的执行协定，其中76％的“援助”是用在农业方面，发展工业的“援助”几乎没有。美国对巴基斯坦的私人投资，也主要是投在占有巴基斯坦的石油等重要资源方面，对于建立巴基斯坦民族工业、特别是建立重工业方面则毫无兴趣。
    在“援助”幌子的掩盖下，美国公司在巴基斯坦所取得的利润是高得惊人的。1955年秋天，美国公司勾结美国“国际合作署”（美国主持援外工作的机关）承包巴基斯坦东孟加拉省卡尔纳福里水电站工程以谋取暴利的事件，曾引起巴基斯坦舆论的强烈反对。巴基斯坦工程界人士指出：这个工程如果包给巴基斯坦本国的公司来做的话，造价将减少约37％。巴基斯坦“今天报”1955年6月16日报道说，外国公司在巴基斯坦的八千万卢比投资，在1954年一年就汇回去三千五百万卢比的利润。美国在1955年5月还同巴基斯坦签订了一项协议，规定了巴基斯坦优待美国投资的许多项特别的“保证”。当时“巴基斯坦时报”指出，这个协定会使巴基斯坦的民族工业受到更严重的打击，并且引起进一步干涉巴基斯坦内政的危险。
    是不是巴基斯坦的农业毕竟得到美国“帮助了”呢？只要看到这个事实就可以想像得到：美国历年来对巴基斯坦的“援助”，除了军火之外，其余主要是用剩余农产品来支付的。棉花是巴基斯坦主要农产品之一也是主要出口之一。1955年，正当巴基斯坦自己的棉花外销感到困难的时候，美国迫使巴基斯坦接受了二千二百四十万美元的美国棉花。而且这些棉花还被运到日本、西德等处，加工制成棉织品输入巴基斯坦，打击了巴基斯坦的棉农和年轻的纺织工业。巴基斯坦在日本、西欧等处销售棉花的市场，到处遭受美“援”棉花和美国政府津贴出口的棉花的激烈抢夺。巴基斯坦出口棉花所得外汇，在1950—1951年度为九亿八千余万卢比，而1954—1955年度降至三亿三千余万卢比，即损失了三分之二。黄麻也是巴基斯坦主要农产品和出口货之一。它在国际市场上也受到美国压价政策的打击而不断跌价。
    黄麻和棉花占巴基斯坦出口总值的80％左右。由于这方面受到美国的那种“帮助”，巴基斯坦的出口贸易自从1951年即接受美“援”开始以来就成直线地下降。据“巴基斯坦时报”1955年9月30日报道，巴基斯坦的出口总值，在1950—1951年度超过二十五亿卢比，而1954—1955年度降至十一亿余卢比，即减少了54％。这样，就造成了巴基斯坦的国际收支不平衡、通货贬值、物价飞涨等后果。在1955年6月，巴基斯坦的黄金外汇储备比1951年减少了约二分之一。同年八月一日，巴基斯坦被迫把卢比价格贬值30％。作为缓和国内棉麻业危机的一种措施，巴基斯坦棉麻种植面积也受到了限制。
    杜勒斯所吹嘘的美国“援助”所带给受“援”国的“经济发展”，其实际情况就是如此。正是因为如此，所以尽管杜勒斯自吹自打，美国这种组织军事集团的政策和掠夺性的“援助”，在巴基斯坦以及其他一些参加美国军事集团的国家中，引起了越来越多的人的不满和反对。
