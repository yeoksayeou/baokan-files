    Actively Sharing Experiences
    After workers of Team 202 of the Second Mine of the Longyan Iron Mine in Hebei Province created a new record of exceeding the planned daily output by 8.18% in the labor competition, they proactively taught their experience to Team 201, enabling Team 201 to create a new record of exceeding the planned daily output by 22.23%.
    The Dingxing County Iron Factory and the Zhuoxian County Iron Factory both produce water wheels for rural use to draw water from wells. When the two factories were making a part called "bent tee," they had to make a core iron for each casting, which was both labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recently, the Dingxing County Iron Factory improved the method of manufacturing the "bent tee," so that one core iron can be used continuously. This factory immediately sent drawings and improved methods to the Zhuoxian County Iron Factory.
    Mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths, and improving together are the principles of socialist labor competition. Under this principle, not only does each enterprise and each employee need to actively learn from the advanced experiences of others, but also each enterprise and each employee must, like Team 202 of the Second Mine of the Longyan Iron Mine and the Dingxing County Iron Factory, actively tell others about their experiences.

    主动介绍经验
    河北省龙烟铁矿二坑二○二队的职工们，在劳动竞赛中创造了日产量超过计划8.18％的新纪录后，主动地把自己的经验教给二○一队，使二○一队创造了日产量超过计划22.23％的新纪录。
    定兴县铁工厂和涿县铁工厂都给农村生产无井水车。两个厂在做一个叫做“弯三通”的零件的时候，都是每铸一个就要做一个芯铁，既费工，又费时间。最近，定兴县铁工厂改进了制“弯三通”的方法，一个芯铁可以连续使用。这个厂马上给涿县铁工厂寄去了图样和改进的办法。
    互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高，是社会主义劳动竞赛的原则。在这个原则下，不只需要每个企业，每个职工主动学习别人的先进经验，而且也要每个企业，每个职工，像龙烟铁矿二坑二○二队、定兴县铁工厂一样，主动地把自己的经验告诉别人。
