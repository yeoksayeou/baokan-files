Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: As of now, more than 2,400 mechanical factories across the country have participated in inter-factory competitions. These include factories manufacturing nineteen types of products such as machine tools, locomotives and rolling stock, farm implements, tools, electric motors, heavy machinery, and diesel engines.

The inter-factory competition in the mechanical industry, categorized by type, began in December 1955. During the competition, the broad masses of workers actively learned from advanced experiences and continuously created new production achievements. Workers in factories such as the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant and the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant further learned advanced experiences such as "high-speed cutting" during the competition. More than 95% of the lathe operators at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant learned the advanced experience of "high-speed cutting," increasing cutting efficiency by an average of 25% to 100% compared to the past. After revising quotas in March, workers at the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory broke the new quotas within half a month due to learning advanced experiences such as multiple-tool, multiple-edge cutting and surface hardening. In addition, factories extensively exchanged advanced experiences during the competition, enabling many factories to overcome weak links in production.

During the competition, the broad masses of workers in the mechanical industry also put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals. According to incomplete statistics from sixty-seven factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building, workers have put forward more than 38,000 rationalization proposals since the beginning of this year, exceeding the total number of rationalization proposals from all factories under the ministry in 1955 by 28%. Many rationalization proposals, once adopted, have played a significant role in improving production efficiency, product quality, and reducing product costs.

    全国两千多机械工厂展开厂际竞赛
    据新华社9日讯　到目前为止，全国有两千四百多个机械工厂参加了厂际竞赛。其中，包括机床、机车车辆、农具、工具、电机、重型机械、柴油机等十九个类型的工厂。
    机械工业同类型厂际竞赛，是从1955年12月份开始的。在竞赛中，广大职工积极学习先进经验，不断创造新的生产成就。上海机床厂、沈阳第一机床厂等工厂的职工，都在竞赛中进一步学习了“高速切削”等先进经验。上海机床厂有95％以上的车工学习了“高速切削”先进经验，使切削效率比过去平均提高了25％到100％。上海电机厂职工在三月份修订定额以后，由于学习了多刀多刃、表面强化等先进经验。在半个月里就有占95％的工人突破了新定额。此外，在竞赛中厂和厂之间也广泛地展开了交流先进经验的活动，使许多工厂克服了生产上的薄弱环节。
    机械工业广大职工在竞赛中，还提出了成千上万的合理化建议。据第一机械工业部所属六十七个厂不完全统计，今年以来职工们共提出了三万八千多件合理化建议，超过这个部全部工厂1955年合理化建议总数28％。许多合理化建议被采纳以后，对提高生产效率、改进产品质量和降低产品成本起了很大作用。
