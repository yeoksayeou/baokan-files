New Technological Achievements

　　Small-Caliber Seamless Steel Pipes Successfully Rolled

　　Small-caliber seamless steel pipes have been successfully rolled in Shanghai. The first batch of seamless steel pipes with diameters of 35 mm, 26 mm, and 21 mm has been shipped to machinery factories in Guangxi Province for application. The Shanghai Second Bureau of Heavy Industry and relevant specialized companies are planning to add equipment to prepare for formal production.

　　This type of seamless steel pipe was successfully test-rolled by the Yongxin Hardware Manufacturing Factory, a joint state-private enterprise that originally manufactured seamless steel pipes. Small-caliber steel pipes, which are widely used in Shanghai industry, were originally welded from steel plates, which had low pressure resistance and could not be used as steel pipes for boilers, etc., which must withstand high pressure. Later, seamless steel pipes from Anshan Iron and Steel and imported pipes were processed and drawn to make them thinner, which was very uneconomical.

　　New Method to Shorten Steelmaking Time

　　Wang Fengren, foreman of the No. 2 steelmaking furnace workshop at the Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, has developed a new method to shorten melting time. On March 27, Wang Fengren's team shortened the melting time of a furnace of steel by 20 minutes compared to the national target, creating a new record for shortening melting time. The emergence of this method has solved the problem of prolonged melting time that is prevalent in the steelmaking workshop.

　　Wang Fengren's method of shortening melting time involves loading the slag-forming raw materials into the furnace first. When the steelmaking raw materials are melting, the slag-forming raw materials also melt at the same time and float on top of the molten steel, protecting the temperature of the molten steel. In the past, the slag-forming raw materials were added to the molten steel, thus prolonging the melting time.

　　Instrument for Measuring Telephone Line Faults

　　A new type of line tester—the "Pulse Test Line Fault Locator"—has recently been successfully trial-manufactured in the Taiyuan City Post and Telecommunications Bureau. Now, if any fault occurs on a telephone line hundreds of miles away, the staff of the Taiyuan City Post and Telecommunications Bureau sitting in the carrier wave room can rely on this new instrument to accurately measure where the fault occurred within five minutes.

　　This "Pulse Test Line Fault Locator" is the latest technological achievement in Soviet telecommunications. Zheng Leya, a technician at the Taiyuan City Post and Telecommunications Bureau, successfully trial-manufactured this instrument based on a Soviet telecommunications technology magazine.

　　"Flotation Machine" Successfully Trial-Manufactured

　　A "flotation machine" has been successfully trial-manufactured at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant. This flotation machine was trial-manufactured based on the Soviet 6AM model flotation machine design. It has a wide range of uses and can be used for the separation and beneficiation of sulfide and oxide ores of non-ferrous metals such as copper, lead, and zinc, and can also be applied to the beneficiation of non-metallic ores. In addition, it can also be used to select useful raw materials from the mineral powder left after the ore is graded. This flotation machine has been appraised and fully meets technical standards.

　　Fine Porcelain Fired in Kiln Positions for Coarse Porcelain

　　Jingdezhen has recently seen a new method of producing fine porcelain—"low-temperature white glaze." This method can fire fine porcelain in kiln positions that have historically only been able to fire coarse porcelain.

　　The creator of this new method is Feng Zongzhen, an old artist in Jingdezhen. Based on his long-term accumulated experience and after specialized research, he appropriately matched glaze ore and limestone, and applied it to the porcelain blanks for firing. As a result, for the first time, clean white fine porcelain was fired in the higher-temperature kiln positions that could not fire fine porcelain in the past, opening up the way for the mass production of fine porcelain.

专栏：技术上的新成就

    技术上的新成就
    小口径无缝钢管轧制成功
    小口径的无缝钢管在上海轧制成功了。第一批直径三十五公厘、二十六公厘和二十一公厘的无缝钢管已经运到广西省的机械工厂去应用。上海市第二重工业局和有关的专业公司正在筹划添置设备，准备正式投入生产。
    这种无缝钢管，是由一家原来制造无缝钢管的公私合营永鑫五金制造厂试轧成功的。上海工业中应用很广的小口径钢管，原来是用钢板焊成的，耐压力很低，不能作为锅炉管等必须耐高压的钢管，以后就把鞍钢和进口的无缝钢管加工拉细，很不经济。
    缩短炼钢时间的新方法
    本溪钢铁公司钢厂制钢车间二号炼钢炉工长王凤仁，研究出缩短熔化时间的新方法。三月二十七日，王凤仁工段炼一炉钢的熔化时间比国家指标缩短二十分钟，创造了缩短熔化时间的新纪录。这个方法出现以后，解决了制钢车间普遍存在的延长熔化时间的问题。
    王凤仁缩短熔化时间的方法，是把造渣原料先装进炉内，在炼钢原料熔化的时候，造渣的原料也同时熔化了，并且浮在熔化了的钢水上面，护住了钢水的温度。过去，造渣原料是加在钢水里，因此延长了熔化时间。
    测量电话线路发生障碍的仪器
    一种新式测线器——“脉冲测试线路障碍器”，最近在太原市邮电局试制成功。现在，假若数百里外的电话线路上发生了什么障碍，坐在载波室里的太原市邮电局的工作人员，就可依靠这种新式仪器在五分钟内准确地测出障碍发生在那里。
    这种“脉冲测试线路障碍器”，是苏联电讯事业的最新技术成就。太原市邮电局技术员郑乐亚根据苏联电讯技术杂志试制成功了这种仪器。
    “浮游选矿机”试制成功
    一台“浮游选矿机”在沈阳矿山机器厂试制成功。这台选矿机，是根据苏联六AM型浮游选矿机图样试制的。它的用途很广，可以供铜、铅、锌等有色金属的硫化、氧化矿石的分离精选，也能适用于非金属矿石的选矿。另外，还可以利用它把矿石分级以后所剩矿粉当中的有用原料选出来。这台选矿机经过鉴定，完全合乎技术标准。
  粗瓷器的窑位里烧出细瓷器
    景德镇最近出现了一种生产细瓷器的新方法——“低温白釉”。这种方法能够在历来只能烧炼粗瓷器的窑位里烧炼出细瓷器。
    创造这种新法的是景德镇市老艺人冯宗镇。他根据长期积累的经验，经过专门研究，把釉矿石和石灰石进行适当配合，并且把它涂在瓷坯上进行烧炼，结果在过去向来不能烧炼细瓷器的温度较高的窑位里，第一次烧炼出了洁白的细瓷器，为大量生产细瓷器开辟了道路。
