Jiangsu Province launched a spring afforestation campaign day movement. On April 1st, more than 5,000 cadres from government offices and residents in Nanjing City participated in tree planting activities in Mochou Lake, Wutaishan, and suburban areas. Chen Liping, Deputy Mayor of Nanjing, and others planted poplars and weeping willows next to the Shengqi Building in Mochou Lake. Jiangdu County launched a campaign day activity on March 30th, planting 200,000 mulberry and willow trees along the 36-li-long Yangtze River bank. These saplings will mature into forests in three years. From March 25th to 30th, Tongshan County planted 1.17 million trees on sandy wasteland and along roadsides. The county has afforested 10,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by seven times.

Jiangsu Province has already overfulfilled the province's spring afforestation plan. According to preliminary statistics from only 29 counties and cities including Nanjing and Tongshan, more than 222,000 mu of land have been afforested in large tracts. (Our correspondent in Nanjing)

    造林突击日在江苏
    江苏省开展了春季植树造林突击日运动。四月一日，南京市五千多名机关干部和居民，在莫愁湖、五台山和郊区等地进行了植树活动。南京市副市长陈立平等都在莫愁湖胜棋楼旁栽植了白杨和垂柳。江都县三月三十日开展突击日活动，在三十六里长的长江沿岸，栽植桑、柳二十万株，这些树苗三年后即可成林。铜山县从三月二十五日至三十日在沙荒和公路两旁栽树117万株，全县已造林一万亩，超过原计划七倍。
    江苏省已经超额完成全省春季造林计划。仅据南京、铜山等二十九个县、市的初步统计，成片造林已有二十二万二千多亩。（本报驻南京记者）
