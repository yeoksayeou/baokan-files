Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd - Lao News: A spokesman for the Lao Fighting Forces Headquarters issued the following statement on March 28:

    According to foreign news agencies such as Agence France-Presse and United Press International reports on March 20, the British Foreign Office spokesman issued a statement on the situation in Laos. This statement said that the Lao Fighting Forces "rejected the recommendations of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, want to maintain the division of Laos, and violated the Geneva Accords." On March 24, Vientiane Radio also repeated the words of the British Foreign Office spokesman with an even more distorted tone.

    The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces authorized the spokesman of the General Headquarters to issue a statement saying that the statement issued by the British Foreign Office spokesman, as reported by the aforementioned news agencies, is completely inconsistent with the facts.

    The spokesman of the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces is authorized to publish the telegram sent by Prince Souphanouvong to the Chairman of the International Commission for Laos on February 12, 1956, regarding the recommendations of January 7:

      "After the implementation of the military provisions of the Geneva Accords, the Lao Fighting Forces suggested holding a political consultation conference in accordance with Article 14 of the Geneva Accords. In order to create favorable conditions for the consultation conference, the Lao Fighting Forces suggested ceasing hostilities when the conference began. Therefore, on March 9, 1955, both sides signed an agreement to cease hostilities, but the Kingdom side did not fulfill that agreement, mobilized troops to increasingly expand the offensive against the Lao Fighting Forces, and occupied many strongholds. The Lao Fighting Forces have repeatedly suggested that the International Commission intervene. During the Rangoon talks, both sides signed another agreement to cease hostilities on October 11, 1955, but the Kingdom side also failed to fulfill this agreement and continued to launch military offensives against the Lao Fighting Forces in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly. In 1955, the Kingdom side again failed to fulfill Item 3 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference on the issue of general elections. In this situation, the Lao Fighting Forces have written to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the International Commission, requesting that measures be taken to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected.

    Now we have received your telegram, and we very much welcome your continued efforts to seek measures to resolve the Lao issue. We believe that, in the current situation, it is necessary to realize the issue of ceasing military conflicts, as suggested by the International Commission on December 9 of last year.

    Regarding the talks between the two sides, I am very welcome. As before, at any time, I and the Lao Fighting Forces are willing to strictly and thoroughly implement the provisions of the Geneva Accords."

    The above telegram once again clearly expresses Prince Souphanouvong's and the Lao Fighting Forces' sincerity in implementing the Geneva Accords and their sincere attitude in cooperating with the International Commission.

    The spirit and content of this telegram powerfully corrects the erroneous information reported by Agence France-Presse, United Press International, etc., and also exposes the distorted arguments of Vientiane Radio, which aim to confuse domestic and world public opinion. This argument attempts to conceal their conspiracy to strengthen the army, attack and occupy the two provinces where the Lao Fighting Forces are concentrated, making the situation in Laos increasingly tense, which is very harmful to common peace and the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords.

    寮国战斗部队发言人驳斥英国外交部的歪曲论调
    新华社河内2日电　老挝消息：寮国战斗部队总司令部发言人在三月二十八日发表如下声明：
    据法新社和合众社等外国通讯社在三月二十日报道说，英国外交部发言人发表了关于老挝情况声明。这份声明说寮国战斗部队“拒绝老挝国际监督和监察委员会的建议，想维持分割老挝的状态，违反了日内瓦协定。”三月二十四日，万象广播电台也以更加歪曲的论调重复了英国外交部发言人的话。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部授权总司令部发言人发表声明说，根据上述通讯社所报道的英国外交部发言人发表的声明是完全不符合事实的。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部发言人受权公布苏发努冯亲王在1956年2月12日寄给老挝国际委员会主席关于一月七日的建议的电文如下：
      “在实施了日内瓦协定的有关军事条款部分后，寮国战斗部队建议按照日内瓦协定第十四条的规定举行政治协商会议，为了给协商会议造成顺利的条件，在会议开始举行的时候，寮国战斗部队建议停止敌对行动，因此在1955年3月9日双方签订了停止敌对行动的协议，但是王国方面没有履行那个协议，调动军队日益扩大对寮国战斗部队的进攻，并且占领了许多据点。寮国战斗部队曾经多次建议国际委员会予以干涉。举行仰光会谈时，双方又在1955年10月11日签订停止敌对行动协议，但是王国方面也不履行这个协议，仍旧不断地向桑怒、丰沙里两省的寮国战斗部队发动军事进攻。在1955年内，王国方面又不履行关于普选问题的日内瓦会议最后宣言第三项。在这种情况下寮国战斗部队已经写信给日内瓦会议两位主席和国际委员会，要求采取措施来使日内瓦协定得到尊重。
    现在收到了你的来电，我们非常欢迎你不断地寻求措施来解决老挝问题所作的努力。我们认为，在目前情况下，必须实现如国际委员会在去年十二月九日所建议的，停止军事冲突问题。
    关于双方会谈的事，我非常欢迎。和以前一样，在任何时候，我和寮国战斗部队都愿意严格和彻底地执行日内瓦协定的各项条款。”
    上述电文再一次明确地表示了苏发努冯亲王和寮国战斗部队在执行日内瓦协定中的诚意和同国际委员会合作的诚恳态度。
    这个电文的精神和内容有力地更正了由法新社、合众社等所报道的错误消息，并且也揭露了万象广播电台旨在混乱国内和世界人民舆论的歪曲论调，这种论调企图掩饰他们加强军队，进攻和占领寮国战斗部队集结的两省的阴谋，使老挝局势日益紧张，这对于共同的和平和日内瓦协定的彻底实施是非常有害的。
