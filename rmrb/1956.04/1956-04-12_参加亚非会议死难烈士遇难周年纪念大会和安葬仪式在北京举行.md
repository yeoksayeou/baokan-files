Xinhua News Agency, Beijing—A memorial meeting and burial ceremony for the martyrs who died attending the Asian-African Conference was held at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing on the afternoon of the 11th.

    The front of the white marble tombstone standing in the cemetery is engraved with the inscription written by Premier Zhou Enlai: "Cemetery of the Martyrs Who Died Attending the Asian-African Conference." On the back of the tombstone are engraved the brief biographies of eleven martyrs: Shi Zhiang, Li Zhaoji, and Zhong Buyun, staff members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference; Wang Mingfang, a staff member of the delegation from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Asian-African Conference; Chinese journalists Shen Jiantu, Huang Zuomei, Du Hong, Li Ping, and Hao Fengge, who accompanied the delegation to cover the event; Polish journalist Starets; and Austrian journalist Ian Fairbairn. The base of the tombstone is engraved with the circumstances of the martyrs' deaths. In front of the tombstone and the portraits of the martyrs hanging on both sides are wreaths offered by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhou Enlai, Chen Yun, Chen Yi, Peng Zhen, various democratic parties, people's organizations, government organs, and friends of the martyrs.
    The memorial meeting and burial ceremony were attended by: Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China; Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council; Zhang Wentian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade; Wu Lengxi and Wang Yunsheng, Vice Presidents of the All-China Journalists Association; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; staff members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference; heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations; family members and friends of the martyrs and representatives from their respective organizations; representatives from the embassies of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Poland, India, and Indonesia in China; representatives from various news organizations in Beijing and foreign journalists in Beijing; and over 1,200 cadres and students from various government organs and organizations.
    As the memorial meeting and burial ceremony began, the band played mourning music. Then, Wu Lengxi, Vice President of the All-China Journalists Association, placed the remains of the martyrs in the tomb and laid a wreath in front of the tomb.
    After all present stood in silence, Wu Lengxi delivered a eulogy in front of the tomb. After recounting the circumstances of the deaths of the martyrs attending the Asian-African Conference, he said: "The crash of the 'Kashmir Princess' was a despicable and shameless act of murder. Over the past year, thanks to the joint efforts of the Chinese government, the Indian government, the Indonesian government, and other relevant parties, the truth of this murder has been revealed to the world. The British government's statement on January 11 this year also fully confirmed the facts pointed out by China, India, and Indonesia. However, to this day, the murderers are still at large, and the British authorities have not taken further effective measures to bring the murderers to justice and convict them. This is something that all the countries and peoples to which the victims belonged cannot but find unsatisfactory. The British government has a responsibility to bring the perpetrators who have been identified to justice and prosecute them according to the law. Relevant parties are willing to assist. If the British authorities are determined to do so, a thorough resolution of this case should be entirely possible."
    Wu Lengxi said: It has been a year since the deaths of martyrs such as Shi Zhiang. The development of the Asian-African situation is completely contrary to the wishes of those forces hostile to the Asian and African people. The cause of peace in the two continents of Asia and Africa has achieved further victories. This proves that the just cause of the people cannot be hindered by any force. The just cause for which the martyrs sacrificed their lives is constantly advancing.
    The people attending the memorial meeting and burial ceremony finally walked around the tomb area and bid farewell to the sleeping martyrs. Before leaving the cemetery, Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his cordial condolences to the families of the martyrs one by one.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 11—The memorial meeting held here today for the anniversary of the deaths of the martyrs who died attending the Asian-African Conference sent telegrams to the families of martyr Wang Mingfang, a staff member of the delegation from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Asian-African Conference, martyr Starets, a Polish journalist, and martyr Ian Fairbairn, an Austrian journalist, informing them that the remains of the martyrs had been buried in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing at 3:00 p.m. today, and expressing their heartfelt condolences.
    The memorial meeting also sent telegrams to the families of the Indian ground crew members of the "Kashmir Princess" who died in the crash, D.K. Jatar, Kuna, Finca, and Pimenta Gloria Berry, and to the survivors, Captain Dixit, Mr. Karnik, and Mr. Pathak, expressing their heartfelt condolences. (Attached picture)

    参加亚非会议死难烈士遇难周年纪念大会和安葬仪式在北京举行
    据新华社讯　参加亚非会议死难烈士遇难周年纪念大会和安葬仪式十一日下午在北京八宝山革命公墓举行。
    矗立在墓地上的汉白玉墓碑正面，镌刻着周恩来总理写的碑文：“参加亚非会议的死难烈士公墓”。在墓碑后面镌刻着我国参加亚非会议代表团的工作人员石志昂、李肇基、钟步云，越南民主共和国参加亚非会议代表团工作人员王明芳，随同前往采访的中国新闻记者沈建图、黄作梅、杜宏、李平、郝凤格，波兰记者斯塔列茨，奥地利记者严斐德等十一位烈士的简历，碑座上镌刻有烈士的遇难经过。在墓碑和悬挂在两侧的烈士们遗像前面，摆着中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会，中国共产党中央委员会，周恩来、陈云、陈毅、彭真和各民主党派、各人民团体、各机关和烈士们生前友好敬献的花圈。
    参加纪念大会和安葬仪式的有：中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧，国务院秘书长习仲勋，外交部副部长张闻天，对外贸易部副部长雷任民，中国新闻工作者联谊会副会长吴冷西、王芸生，北京市副市长吴晗，出席亚非会议中国代表团的工作人员，各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，烈士的家属亲友和所在机关的代表，越南民主共和国、波兰、印度和印度尼西亚驻中国使馆的代表，北京各新闻单位的代表和在北京的外国记者，以及各机关、团体的干部、学生等一千二百多人。
    纪念大会和安葬仪式开始，乐队奏哀乐。接着，中国新闻工作者联谊会副会长吴冷西把烈士的遗骨安置在墓穴内，并且在墓前敬献花圈。
    全场肃立默哀以后，吴冷西在墓前致悼词。他在回述了参加亚非会议死难烈士遇难经过以后，说：“克什米尔公主”号飞机的失事，是一桩卑鄙无耻的谋杀事件。一年来，由于中国政府、印度政府、印度尼西亚政府以及其他有关方面的共同努力的结果，这一谋杀事件的真相已大白于天下。英国政府在今年一月十一日发表的声明中也完全证实了中国、印度和印度尼西亚所指出的事实。然而，直到现在，杀人凶手们仍然逍遥法外，英国当局还没有采取进一步的有效措施，把杀人凶手们捉拿归案，定罪判刑。这是所有受害者所属的国家和人民不能不认为不满意的。英国政府有责任使已经调查确实的凶手们归案法办。有关方面是愿意协助的。如果英国当局决心这样做，这一案件的彻底破案应该是完全可能的。
    吴冷西说：石志昂等烈士遇难已经一年，亚非局势的发展完全与那些敌视亚非人民的势力的愿望相反。亚非两大洲的和平事业已获得进一步的胜利。这就证明，人民的正义事业是任何力量所阻挠不住的。烈士们为之牺牲了自己的生命的正义事业正不断前进。
    参加纪念大会和安葬仪式的人们，最后全体绕行墓地一周，向长眠的烈士们告别。周恩来总理在离开墓地以前，曾向烈士们的家属逐一表示亲切的慰问。
    新华社11日讯　今天在这里举行的参加亚非会议死难烈士遇难周年纪念大会分别致电越南民主共和国出席亚非会议代表团工作人员王明芳烈士、波兰记者斯塔列茨烈士和奥地利记者严斐德烈士的家属，告知烈士们的遗骸已经在今天下午三时安葬在北京八宝山革命公墓，并且向他们表示衷心的慰问。
    纪念大会同时致电印度“克什米尔公主”号飞机罹难的印度机务工作人员德·克·贾塔尔、库纳、芬差、皮门塔格洛丽亚·贝里的家属，生还的狄克希特上尉、卡尼克先生和帕塔克先生，向他们表示衷心的慰问。（附图片）
