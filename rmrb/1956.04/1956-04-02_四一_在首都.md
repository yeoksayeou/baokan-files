    "April 1st" in the Capital
    Yesterday marked the first national "April 1st" Afforestation Day for young people and children. On this day, the vast number of young people and children in Beijing carried out large-scale voluntary labor to green the capital.
    In the central area of "April 1st" afforestation—Babaoshan—as the cool morning breeze blew snowflakes, thousands of young people and children from government offices, enterprises, schools, and other organizations rushed to the planting site. Students from the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute and Beijing No. 39 Middle School, along with their teachers, planted thousands of ash, oil pine, cypress, smoke tree, and maple trees on the highest hilltop behind the Cemetery of Revolutionary Martyrs. An Jiaji, an advanced producer from the Telecommunications Design Office of the Ministry of Railways Design Bureau, who had just attended the National Conference of Advanced Railway Producers Representatives, and Yang Changzuo, an engineer from the same design office, also participated in the tree planting. Officers and soldiers from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy brought their own water pumps to draw water in a timely manner to water the trees, ensuring that every tree planted would survive.
    On this day, in the rural areas of the suburbs, along many rivers and roads, and in parks and other places, crowds of people were also busy planting trees. On the banks of the Liangshui River, which stretches more than seventeen li from Dahongmen to Jiugong, the children from Dahongmen Central Primary School in the Nan Yuan District joyfully planted trees together with their aunts and uncles. Members of agricultural producers' cooperatives such as Macun, Dahongmen, and Shizhuang provided technical guidance here, while others undertook difficult tasks such as digging up reed roots. In just a few hours, eight rows of willows and poplar trees were neatly planted on both sides of the Liangshui River. Cui Qixing, vice chairman of the Shizhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, looked at the lovely saplings and said happily: "In a few years, when the trees grow up, not only will our motherland's capital become more beautiful, but we can also ensure that the river embankment is not washed away by the water!"
    On this day, nearly one million trees were planted throughout the city. The city's young people and children are full of confidence and guarantee to basically "green the capital" in three to five years.

### “四一”在首都

    “四一”在首都
    昨天，是全国青少年的第一个“四一”造林日。这一天，北京广大青少年开展了大规模绿化首都的义务劳动。
    在“四一”造林的中心地区——八宝山，当清晨的凉风吹舞着一片雪花的时候，几千名青少年就从机关、企业、学校等赶到植树工地。北京钢铁工业学院、北京三十九中等学校的学生和他们的教师们一起，在烈士公墓后面最高的山头上种下了几千棵白腊、油松、侧柏、黄栌和元宝枫。刚刚参加了全国铁路先进生产者代表会议的铁道部设计总局电务设计事务所先进生产者安家骥，以及这个设计事务所的工程师杨昌祚等都来参加了植树。中国人民解放军海军某部的军官和士兵们自己带来了水泵，及时汲水浇树，保证种一棵活一棵。
    这一天，在郊区农村和许多河流、道路两旁，以及公园等地方，也拥挤着植树的人群。在从大红门到旧宫十七华里多的凉水河堤岸上，南苑区大红门中心小学的小朋友们兴高采烈地同阿姨、叔叔们一起种树。马村、大红门、石庄等农业生产合作社的社员们，有的在这里担任技术指导，有的担负挖苇根等困难的工作。在短短的几个小时里，凉水河两岸就整齐地栽上了八行毛柳和白杨树。石庄农业生产合作社副社长崔启兴望着这些可爱的树苗高兴地说：“过几年树长大了，不但我们祖国的首都更加美丽，而且可以保证河堤不被水冲垮！”
    这一天，全市共种植了近一百万棵树。全市青少年们都满怀信心地保证在三年到五年内基本上“绿化首都”。
