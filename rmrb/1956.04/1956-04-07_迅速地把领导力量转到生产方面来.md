    Swiftly Shift Leadership Strength to Production
    By our reporter Ji Yin
    The CPC Central Committee's Shanghai Bureau held an enlarged meeting of its committee members from March 12th to 17th. The meeting, based on the decisive victories already achieved in agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, as well as the emergence of a socialist competition upsurge in industrial production, focused on discussing how to rapidly strengthen the Party's leadership over industrial and agricultural production.
    The meeting analyzed the situation of agricultural cooperativization and production in these three regions. The number of peasant households joining cooperatives in all three regions has reached over 90%, and the overall development of the movement is normal and healthy. Since mid-February, all agricultural cooperatives have stopped expanding and have fully shifted to spring plowing and the consolidation of the cooperatives. With the development of cooperativization, great achievements have also been made in water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. The achievements in water conservancy construction are particularly remarkable. In Jiangsu, from last winter to the Spring Festival, 170 million cubic meters of earthwork were excavated in water conservancy construction, more than ten times that of the same period last year. Zhejiang completed 157,000 projects, and with the spring repair projects, also increased by fourteen times compared to the same period last year. This has laid the foundation for a large increase in production this year.
    The overall situation in rural work is good, but some new problems have also arisen. One problem that deserves special attention is that under the situation of rapid development of agricultural cooperativization, some rural work comrades are not calm enough, do not look at whether there are conditions, and regardless of whether there is any possibility, want to complete all work ahead of schedule and exceed the target. Plans are too large, demands are too high, many tasks are advancing simultaneously, and non-productive activities are frequent, resulting in excessive consumption of manpower and material resources, weakening the central task of agricultural production. According to statistics from an agricultural cooperative in Jiangning County, Jiangsu, various non-productive activities have recently accounted for about 6% of the cooperative's total labor days. Related to this situation is that some cooperative leaders have ignored the principle of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily" and blindly carried out non-productive and not very urgent capital construction. For example, a cooperative in Wenling County, Zhejiang, built a three-story building similar to the county people's committee. A cooperative in Ruian County, Zhejiang, spent 30,000 yuan to build a pig shed. Some places attempted to prematurely abolish old-fashioned farm tools and put forward the erroneous slogans of "eliminating rice barrels, eliminating (old) waterwheels, and eliminating soil plows." The meeting specifically stated that the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) is a long-term struggle goal, and its central link is to develop agricultural production. Only when production develops and farmers' incomes increase can farmers possibly realize other requirements proposed in the program with their own strength. This year, most cooperatives are newly established, and the economic strength of farmers is still limited. It should not and is not possible to "revive everything at once." The enthusiasm of the masses should be supported, but if you try to complete everything in a short period of time, it will turn a good thing into a bad thing and frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses. The meeting called on Party committees at all levels to earnestly implement the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily," to promote making do with whatever is available, spending less money and doing more things, cherishing manpower, materials, and financial resources, using less if possible, and resolutely not using what can be used or not used. Non-productive expenditures should be reduced to the lowest limit. "Ensuring increased production in cooperatives and ensuring increased income for more than 90% of the members" should be taken as the central goal of leading agricultural production. All work in the countryside must revolve around this central goal, distinguishing between priorities and arranging everything in an all-round way. Do not try to achieve work that requires five, seven, or twelve years to complete in one or two years, regardless of the conditions.
    Following the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, a socialist competition upsurge has also begun in industrial and mining enterprises in the Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang regions. Moreover, the breadth and depth of this socialist competition in the industrial sector are unprecedented. According to statistics, tens of thousands of factories and enterprises in the three regions have been involved in the competition. This new situation urgently requires the Party committee to further strengthen leadership. The meeting believes that there are still some problems in the socialist competition that has begun in industry. That is: the mobilization of the masses is not sufficient, the idea of relying on the masses has not been fully established, and the goals of the competition are not clear enough. There is a phenomenon of simply pursuing output value and output, while ignoring quality and cost. This is mainly reflected in the following three aspects: First, the product quality plans and new product trial production plans of many factories in January and February have not been completed. For example, the state-owned Shanghai Motor Factory only completed 83 of the 105 products in January, and there was a decline in February. Twelve gantry cranes of the state-owned Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory were scrapped in February. Second, although some factories have paid attention to improving product quality, they have ignored saving. For example, some cotton textile factories in Shanghai canceled the measures to save cotton in the past during the quality improvement campaign, and the amount of cotton used greatly increased. Third, many factories, due to the pursuit of output, have ignored operational safety. In the past two months, accidents in factories and mines in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have generally increased.
    In addition, many enterprises are satisfied with the spectacular momentum of the competition and do not pay much attention to the practical effects of the competition, resulting in a tendency toward formalism. For example, in formulating the annual plan, Shanghai State Cotton Factory No. 8 stipulated that 6,000 rationalization proposals should be put forward this year, and specific indicators for putting forward rationalization proposals were put forward to various workshops. The leadership of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory called on everyone to put forward a rationalization proposal at the employee representative meeting. Furthermore, some new specific difficulties such as insufficient supply of raw materials have also emerged in the competition. The meeting studied these issues and pointed out that the main problem at present is to clarify the goals of socialist competition and, based on the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, especially under the conditions of better and more economical, strive to complete the 1956 production plan ahead of schedule and strive to reach the 1957 level. All enterprise departments should formulate production plans in accordance with this spirit, based on needs and possibilities. Products that the country and the people need and have raw materials for should be greatly increased in production; products that the country and the people need but lack raw materials for should strive to increase production on the premise of striving to recover waste materials, strive for raw materials, and save raw materials; products that have raw materials but the variety of colors and patterns do not meet the needs must actively improve the variety of colors and patterns of the products; products that have raw materials but the demand is not large should be produced according to the needs. At the same time, enterprises should, according to needs and possibilities, expand the manufacture of new products in a planned way. All enterprise competitions must put forward struggle goals in accordance with this spirit and be carried out with preparation and leadership. All those that can increase production should direct the goals of the competition to increasing production and improving quality and reducing costs. If it is not possible to increase production, the competition should be guided to mainly improving quality and reducing costs. The meeting pointed out that on this issue, on the one hand, we must oppose the conservative tendencies of some cadres who do not believe in the wisdom of the masses and are unwilling or not actively mobilizing the masses. At the same time, we must strengthen the Party's specific leadership over the competition and actively help solve the difficulties that may occur in the competition so that the socialist competition can be consolidated and continue to develop.
    The meeting emphasized that in the socialist competition, it is necessary to do a good job in the Party's political and ideological work, facing all employees of the enterprise, including production workers, auxiliary workers, and all technical and management personnel. We must constantly expand the ranks of advanced producers and strive to educate the backward to learn from the advanced. Regarding the phenomenon that has already emerged in the current competition that departments are lagging behind workshops, enterprise leaders should not simply or inappropriately blame them, but should adopt a positive attitude of helping. The meeting criticized the phenomenon that some enterprise Party organizations do not care about employees' technical learning and welfare. For example, the living conditions of employees in some factories in Shanghai are very poor, and some dormitories are far from the factory, taking several hours to commute to and from work every day, but the Party organizations of these factories turn a blind eye to these situations. The meeting also discussed socialist competition and other issues in industrial production.
    Under the new situation of the socialist revolution, our country's economic construction has entered a new stage of development. The new situation requires local Party committees to shift more leadership strength to production. This meeting of the Shanghai Bureau is a meeting for Party committees to further strengthen their leadership over industrial and agricultural production. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Party Committees and the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee will further study the issue of the Party's leadership over industrial and agricultural production in the future based on the spirit of this meeting, so that the Party's leading role in production can be truly strengthened.

    迅速地把领导力量转到生产方面来
    本报记者　季音
    中共中央上海局在三月十二日至十七日举行了委员（扩大）会议。会议根据江苏、浙江、上海三个地区的农业合作化和私营工商业的社会主义改造已经取得了决定性的胜利，以及工业生产中开始出现了社会主义竞赛的热潮，着重讨论了如何迅速加强党对工农业生产的领导问题。
    会议对这三个地区的农业合作化的情况和生产的情况作了分析。三个地区入社农户均已占90％以上，整个运动的发展是正常的，健康的。从二月中旬以后，全部农业合作社已经停止发展，全部转入春耕生产和社的整顿巩固工作。随着合作化的发展，水利建设和积肥等工作也取得了巨大成就。水利建设的成绩尤其显著。江苏从去冬到春节的水利建设中，即挖了一亿七千万土方，比去年同期超过十多倍，浙江完成了十五万七千处工程，加上春修工程，比去年同期也增加十四倍。这就为今年的大量增产打下了基础。
    农村工作中总的状况是好的，但是也发生了一些新的问题。其中特别值得注意的一个问题是：在农业合作化迅速发展的形势下，有些农村工作同志头脑不够冷静，不看有没有条件，不管有没有可能，什么工作都想提前并超额完成，计划偏大，要求过高，许多工作齐头并进，非生产活动频繁，结果消耗了过多的人力物力，削弱了农业生产这个中心任务。据江苏江宁县一个农业社的统计，最近以来，各种非生产活动约占去了整个社劳动日的6％左右。与这个情况有联系的是：有些社的领导人忽视了“勤俭办社”的原则，盲目地进行非生产性的和不十分急需的基本建设，浙江温岭县就有一个社盖了一所与县人民委员会一样的三层大楼。浙江瑞安县一个社花了三万元造猪棚。有的地方企图过早地取消旧式农具，提出了什么“消灭稻桶、消灭（旧）水车、消灭土犁”的错误口号。会议特别说明：全国农业发展纲要（草案）是一个较长期的奋斗目标，它的中心环节是发展农业生产，只有生产发展了，农民收入增加了，农民才有可能以自己的力量去实现纲要中提出的其他各项要求。今年大部分合作社都是新成立的，农民经济力量还有限，不应该也不可能“百废俱兴”，群众的积极性是应当支持的，但是如果企图在一个短时期内把什么事情都办完，这样反会把好事办坏，挫折了群众的积极性。会议要各地党委切实贯彻“勤俭办社”的方针，要提倡因陋就简，少花钱、多办事，爱惜人力、物力、财力，能少用的要少用，可用可不用的坚决不用，非生产开支要压低到最低的限度。要把“保证合作社增产，保证90％以上的社员增加收入”，作为领导农业生产的中心目标。农村中的一切工作必须围绕这个中心目标分别轻重缓急，全面安排。不要把确实需要五年、七年、十二年才能完成的工作，不顾条件地硬要在一、二年内去实现。
    随着农业合作化的高潮之后，上海、江苏、浙江三个地区的工矿企业里也开始出现社会主义竞赛的热潮，而且这次工业部门中社会主义竞赛的广泛性和深刻性，都是空前未有的。据统计三个地区数以万计的工厂企业都卷入了竞赛，这个新形势迫切地要求党委进一步加强领导。会议认为目前工业中开始的社会主义竞赛还存在着一些问题。这就是：群众发动还不够充分，依靠群众的思想还没有完全树立，竞赛的目标还不够明确，存在着单纯追求产值、产量，忽视质量、成本的现象。这主要表现在以下三个方面：一、一、二月份许多工厂的产品质量计划和新产品试制计划都没有完成。如国营上海电机厂一月份的一○五种产品，只完成八十三种，二月份又有下降。国营上海矿山机器厂二月份有十二台启闭机报废。二、有些工厂虽然注意了提高产品质量，却又忽视了节约，如上海有些棉纺厂在提高质量运动中，将过去节约用棉的措施取消了，用棉量大为增加。三、不少工厂由于追求产量，忽视了操作安全，两个月来，上海、江苏、浙江三个地区厂矿中的事故普遍增加。
    此外，还有不少企业满足于竞赛的声势轰轰烈烈，不大注意竞赛的切实的效果，产生了形式主义的倾向。如上海国棉八厂在制定全年规划中，规定今年要提六千条合理化建议，并向各个车间提出提合理化建议的具体指标。大中华橡胶厂领导上在职工代表会上号召每人提一条合理化建议。还有，竞赛中也出现了一些原材料供应不足等新的具体困难。会议对这些问题作了研究，指出当前的主要问题就是要明确社会主义竞赛的目标，根据又多、又快、又好、又省的原则，特别是在又好、又省的条件下争取又多、又快地提前完成1956年的生产计划，并争取达到1957年的水平。各企业部门应当按照这一精神，根据需要和可能，制定生产计划，凡是国家和人民需要、又有原材料的产品，应该大力增产；凡是国家和人民需要而缺乏原材料的产品，应该在力求回收废料、争取原料和节约原材料的前提下，争取增产；凡是有原料而花色品种不适合需要的，必须积极改进产品的花色品种；凡是有原料但需要量不大的，应该根据需要来生产。同时企业还要根据需要与可能有计划地扩大新产品的制造。所有企业的竞赛都要按照这个精神，提出奋斗目标，有准备，有领导地进行，凡是可以增加生产的，就要把竞赛的目标引向增加生产和提高质量、降低成本方面去，如果不可能增加生产的就要把竞赛引导到主要是提高质量、降低成本方面去。会议指出，在这个问题上，一方面必须反对某些干部不相信群众的智慧，不愿意或不积极发动群众的保守倾向，同时，必须加强党对竞赛的具体领导，积极帮助解决竞赛过程中可能发生的困难，使社会主义竞赛能够巩固并持续发展下去。
    会议强调地指出，在社会主义竞赛中要做好党的政治思想工作，面向企业的全体职工，其中包括生产工人、辅助工人和所有技术、管理人员。要不断地扩大先进生产者的队伍，争取教育落后的向先进看齐。对科室人员要根据党对知识分子的政策，团结他们，对目前竞赛中已出现了的科室落后于车间的现象，企业领导人不要单纯地或不适当地责备他们，而应当采取积极帮助的态度。这次会议批评了某些企业党组织不关心职工技术学习、生活福利的现象。如上海有些工厂职工的居住条件很不好，有的宿舍离工厂很远，每天上下班要花几小时，而这些厂的党组织对这些情形却置若罔闻。会议还对社会主义竞赛和工业生产中的其他若干问题作了讨论。
    在社会主义革命的新形势下，我们国家的经济建设已经进入一个新的发展阶段，新的形势要求地方党委把更多的领导力量转移到生产方面来。上海局的这次会议，就是党委进一步加强对工农业生产领导的会议，江苏、浙江省委和上海市委，都将要根据这次会议的精神，来进一步具体研究今后党对工农业生产的领导问题，使党在生产中的领导作用真正地加强起来。
