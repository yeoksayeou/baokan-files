Xinhua News Agency, London, April 20th: According to TASS reports from London on the 20th, after the conclusion of the talks between Soviet and British leaders on the morning of April 20th, Bulganin and Khrushchev traveled by car to London's Lord Mayor's Residence at 12:30 PM, where a grand banquet was held for the Soviet leaders.

In front of the Lord Mayor's Residence, located in the very center of the business district of the British capital, countless Londoners gathered to welcome Bulganin and Khrushchev. In the buildings lining both sides of the street leading to the Lord Mayor's Residence, every window facing the street was crowded with employees and customers of numerous institutions and companies. They warmly welcomed the Soviet leaders, waving to them and shouting "Hurrah!" The guests received a particularly warm welcome from the workers working on the construction site of the office building next to the Lord Mayor's Residence.

Sir Seymour Howard, who was acting as Lord Mayor of London during the absence of Lord Mayor Ackroyd, welcomed Bulganin and Khrushchev in the reception room of the Lord Mayor's Residence. Sir Howard, wearing the traditional Lord Mayor's robes, was accompanied by city councilors and aldermen, as well as other city government officials wearing red and blue silk robes with fur trim. To welcome the Soviet guests, the city government guards, dressed in ornate uniforms and armor and wielding weapons from the time of Cromwell, were lined up in the hall as a guard of honor.

Many guests attending the banquet also came to welcome them, including Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden.

More than three hundred people attended the banquet. Seated at the table under the emblem of the City of London were Howard, Bulganin, Khrushchev, Eden, Lloyd-George, Macmillan, Sandys, Thorneycroft, Gaitskell, Attlee, Norwegian Ambassador Prebensen, head of the diplomatic mission in London, high commissioners from Commonwealth countries, city councilors of the City of London, and Mikhailov, Gromyko, Malik, Kumykin, and others who accompanied Bulganin and Khrushchev on their visit. Among the guests attending the banquet were representatives of London authorities and business circles, scientists, and social celebrities. The banquet took place in a warm and sincere atmosphere.

At the end of the banquet, Sir Howard proposed a toast to the health of the Queen of the United Kingdom and to the health of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The national anthems of Great Britain and the Soviet Union were then played.

Sir Howard delivered a welcoming speech to the Soviet leaders at the banquet. He began by expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the courteous hospitality he received during his visit to Moscow last year and for the Soviet people's donation of no less than 90,000 pounds to aid the victims of the floods in Britain in 1953. He went on to say that our Prime Minister has repeatedly emphasized the need to establish closer contacts with the Russian people and those who are responsible for the prosperity and progress of the Russian people, and the Prime Minister also reminded us that the basic purpose of this visit is to discuss many issues that have caused estrangement between Britain and the Soviet Union.

In any case, contact must be established at all levels, and we must never ignore the fact that in order for contact at all levels to be effective, contact at the highest level must be effective. What can best promote international peace and a general relaxation of international tensions is personal contact, and this visit provides an opportunity for direct contact between the two countries. He said that such a relaxation of international tensions cannot be guaranteed by statements of friendly wishes alone. The relaxation of international tensions depends on whether a thorough and patient study and solution can be made to the actual difficulties facing our two countries.

He said that the Soviet envoys of goodwill have come to Britain to hold talks with our leaders and to strive to consolidate the friendly ties and mutual understanding between our two peoples. Howard said: All of us here sincerely hope that these ties will continue to be strengthened, because all those who cherish the ideas of genuine friendship can use these ties as a tool to interpret plans and programs that can guarantee prosperity and mutual protection from the threats of modern inventions. He said that national leaders should ensure that the foundation of their program is solid and stable, and the road to the happiness of all countries should be built on such a basis that those who bear the sacred responsibility of ensuring the safety of all the people for whom they are responsible should have sincerity and mutual agreement with each other.

Howard said that there is now an impression that the vast and unfathomable world of conflicting ideas between our two countries is shrinking, and as it shrinks, our hopes are gradually increasing, and the brilliance of a better world is becoming more and more dazzling. He said: The more opportunities we have to meet each other, the more friendly criticism and expression of our views we have, the better we will be able to reconcile our differences and weave the bonds that bind us more closely together. Howard concluded by saying that he believes that the mission of the Soviet leaders' visit to Britain will be successful. We hope that our guests will take away an impression of our people, a people full of determination, love of labor, love of peace, love of freedom, and friendly attitude towards the Soviet people.

Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin delivered a reply speech amid warm applause from the guests.

Bulganin first thanked him for this warm and friendly welcome speech.

Bulganin said that during our short stay in London, we have already established some contact with Londoners, and we have seen that in these spring days of 1956, Londoners are in a very good mood. This is obviously due in part to the good weather, and in part to circumstances that give hope for a bright future not only to Londoners and those of us who are visiting them, but also to the people of many countries in the world. (Applause)

Bulganin said that many events in international life recently have contributed to an improvement in the climate on the world political stage. The tensions in our relations today are easing, and London and Moscow deserve some credit for this, having established regular friendly ties between them.

Bulganin said that this visit to Britain is to establish contact with British leaders and politicians, to achieve mutual understanding in the course of negotiations with Sir Anthony Eden and his colleagues, to take the necessary measures to establish friendship and broad cooperation and contact in the fields of economy, culture, science and technology, and to expand trade relations between the two countries as much as possible. Bulganin said that the tasks we face are not easy, but we hope that these tasks can and will be resolved. Naturally, all this cannot be done at once. We think that improving our relations and expanding contacts will be done gradually. Our possibilities are great, and it takes time to use these possibilities. However, we hope that our visit to Britain will lay a good foundation for friendly and cooperative relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, which will be based on the great principle of peaceful coexistence.

Bulganin concluded by proposing a toast to the friendly cooperation between the British and Soviet peoples.

Sir Howard expressed his warm gratitude for Bulganin's speech.

The speeches of Howard and Bulganin were broadcast from the Lord Mayor's Residence through the British television network.

After the banquet at the Lord Mayor's Residence, Bulganin and Khrushchev went to 10 Downing Street, where Soviet and British leaders continued their talks.

In the evening, Bulganin and Khrushchev, along with their entourage, visited the Royal Naval College in Greenwich.

    苏联领导人出席在伦敦市长官邸举行的盛大宴会
    伦敦代市长霍华德和布尔加宁致词主张通过多方面的接触加强苏英关系
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社伦敦二十日讯：在苏联及英国领导人在四月二十日上午举行的会谈结束以后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在十二点三十分乘坐汽车前往伦敦市长官邸，这里为苏联领导人举行了盛大宴会。
    在位于英国首都的商业区的最中心地区的市长官邸前，聚集着无数前来欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的伦敦人。在通往市长官邸街道两边的大厦中，朝街的一切窗户里都挤满了无数机关和公司的职员和顾客们。他们热烈地欢迎苏联领导人，向他们挥手，高呼“乌拉！”客人们受到了在市长官邸旁边办公大楼建筑工地上工作的工人们特别热烈的欢迎。
    在伦敦市长阿克罗伊德不在期间代理市长职务的西摩尔·霍华德爵士在市长官邸的客厅欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。霍华德爵士穿着传统的市长长袍，和他一道来欢迎的还有市参议员和郡长以及其他穿着带毛皮镶边的红蓝两色丝绸长袍的市政府官员。为了欢迎苏联客人，穿着华丽的制服和甲胄并且手持克伦威尔时代武器的市政府卫队在大厅里排列成仪仗队。
    参加宴会的许多来宾也都前来欢迎。其中有首相艾登爵士。
    参加宴会的有三百多人。坐在伦敦城徽章下的餐桌旁的有霍华德、布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫、艾登、劳埃德—乔治、麦克米伦、桑迪斯、桑尼克罗夫特、盖次克尔、艾德礼、驻伦敦外交使团团长挪威大使普雷本逊、英联邦各国的高级专员、伦敦城的市参议员以及同布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫前来访问的米哈伊洛夫、葛罗米柯、马立克、库米金等人。参加宴会的来宾中还有伦敦当局和商界人士的代表、科学工作者及社会名流。宴会在热烈、诚恳的气氛中进行。
    在宴会的最后，霍华德爵士建议为联合王国女王的健康和苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席的健康干杯。这时奏起了英苏两国的国歌。
    霍华德爵士在宴会上向苏联领导人致欢迎词。他首先对他在去年访问莫斯科时受到殷勤招待以及苏联人民在1953年英国遭受水灾时捐款不下九万英镑援助灾民表示衷心的感谢。他接着说，我们的首相不时地强调说，必须同俄国人民和那些对俄国人民的繁荣和进步承担着责任的人建立更密切的接触，首相还提醒我们说，这次访问的基本目的是讨论许多使英苏两国发生隔阂的问题。
    无论如何，必须建立各级之间的接触，而且永远不要忽略这样一个事实：要想使各级之间的接触产生效果，那就必须使最高级之间的接触产生效果。最能够促进国际和平和国际紧张局势普遍缓和的是个人接触，像这次的访问就替两国提供了直接接触的机会。他说，这种国际紧张局势的缓和，如果仅凭一些友好愿望的声明，那是不能保证的。国际紧张局势的缓和要看是不是能对我们两国面临的实际困难问题加以周密的、耐心的研究和解决。
    他说，苏联善意的使者来到英国是为了同我们领导人会谈，努力巩固我们两国人民的友谊联系和相互谅解。霍华德说：我们在座的一切人都真诚希望，这些联系将不断加强，因为一切珍视真正友好思想的人们都可以用这种联系作为一种工具，来解释能够保证繁荣和相互保障免于当代发明的威胁的计划和方案。他说，国家领导人应当注意使他的方案的基础坚实稳固，通达各国幸福的道路应当建立在这样的基础上，就是那些负有保障他们所负责的全体人们的安全的神圣责任的人们彼此之间要有诚意，要相互协议。
    霍华德说，现在人们有这样一种印象：我们两国互相抵触的思想观点的广阔的、奥妙莫测的世界正在缩小，而且随着它的缩小，我们的希望在逐渐增长，美好世界的光辉越来越灿烂了。他说：我们彼此见面的机会越多，互相间的友好批评和表达自己的观点越多，那么我们就愈能更好地调解我们的分歧和编织把我们更紧密地联系起来的纽带。霍华德最后说，他相信，苏联领导人访问英国的使命将会获得成功。我们希望，我们客人将会带走对我国人民的印象，我们人民充满决心、热爱劳动、热爱和平、热爱自由和对苏联人民抱着友好态度。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在客人们热烈欢迎下致答词。
    布尔加宁首先感谢这个热烈和友好的欢迎词。
    布尔加宁说，在我们在伦敦停留的短短时期中，我们已经同伦敦人建立了某些接触，我们看见了，在1956年这些春天的日子里，伦敦人的心境很不坏。这显然一方面是由于天气好，另一方面是由于种种不仅令伦敦人和我们这些到他们这里作客的人们，而且也令世界许多国家人民对美好前途产生希望的情况。（鼓掌）
    布尔加宁说，最近国际生活中的许多事件促进了世界政治舞台上气候的好转。我们两国关系中的紧张状态今天得以缓和，伦敦以及莫斯科是有一部分功劳的，它们之间已经建立了经常的友谊联系。
    布尔加宁说，这次访问英国是为了同英国的领导人和政界人士建立接触，为了在同艾登爵士和他的同事们的谈判过程中取得相互了解，在建立友谊和建立经济、文化、科学、技术方面的广泛合作和联系方面采取必要的措施，为了想尽可能地扩大两国之间的贸易关系。布尔加宁说，我们所面临的任务不是轻易的，但是我们希望，这些任务能够、并且一定会获得解决。自然，这一切不是一下子就能够做到的。我们想，改善我们之间的关系和扩大联系都将逐步做到。我们的可能性是很大的，要利用这种可能性就需要时间。但是，我们希望，我们对英国的访问将替英国和苏联之间的友好、合作关系奠定良好的基础，这种关系将以伟大的和平共处原则作为基础。
    布尔加宁最后建议为英国人民和苏联人民之间的友好合作而干杯。
    霍华德爵士对布尔加宁的讲话表示热烈感谢。
    霍华德和布尔加宁的讲话从市长官邸中通过英国电视网播送出去。
    在市长官邸的宴会之后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫又到唐宁街十号，苏联和英国的领导人在那里继续举行会谈。
    晚间，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫以及随行人员参观了格林威治的皇家海军学院。
