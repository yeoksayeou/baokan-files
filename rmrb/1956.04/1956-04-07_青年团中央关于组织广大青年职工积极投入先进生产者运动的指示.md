Under the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers in our country are growing day by day. Advanced producers are emerging continuously, and the slogan of completing and overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule has become the practical action of workers across the country. In order to more comprehensively promote a new upsurge in labor competition and socialist mass movements, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has issued a resolution on carrying out the advanced producer movement. The development of the advanced producer movement will promote the rapid improvement of labor productivity and the technical level of the working class in our country, and will enable the working class in our country to further develop its fine qualities of loyalty, courage, unity, and progress. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League requires the organizations of the Communist Youth League at all levels to use their greatest strength to mobilize and help young workers strive to become advanced producers, so that the nation's 7 million young workers become the most active force in the advanced producer movement and struggle for a new upsurge in China's economic and cultural construction.

Under the cultivation and education of the Party, the younger generation of workers in our country has demonstrated the valuable characteristics of being vigorous and eager to accept new things in labor and learning. Cherishing and carrying forward these characteristics, fully organizing their labor enthusiasm, and continuously improving their ability to master new technologies are the common responsibilities of trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations. To this end, the Communist Youth League organizations must have a full sense of initiative in their work. According to the characteristics of various industries and the main requirements of current production, they should initiate and organize various production activities among young workers, and create a variety of working methods suitable for the characteristics of young people, to attract and organize more young workers to play a shock role in the entire socialist competition. It is wrong to only make general calls without organizing specific activities, or to be satisfied with holding meetings and mobilizing without carrying out meticulous organizational work. We should always pay attention to preventing the emergence of formalism. Currently, the activities carried out by youth workers in various places, such as "superior product quality," "high-speed cutting and metal saving," and "one hundred spindles without yarn breakage," organizing youth shock teams, cultivating youth advanced production teams and groups, and organizing competitions between youth teams and groups and youth shock workers in different types of work. Establishing youth supervision posts and savings teams are all methods that have proven to have good results in actual work, and the Communist Youth League organizations in various places should coordinate with trade unions to apply them appropriately according to their own circumstances.

Learning advanced experience, mastering new technologies, and improving cultural and scientific knowledge are urgent requirements for young workers and a central link in carrying out the advanced producer movement. The Communist Youth League organizations should coordinate with the administration and trade unions to widely hold advanced work method training classes, spare-time technical schools and spare-time cultural schools, sign master-apprentice contracts and mutual aid contracts, and hold technical conferences for the same types of work, so that young workers can become the most active learners of advanced experience and new technologies. While organizing youth labor, we must also pay close attention to the health and rest of young workers, gradually improve the living conditions of young workers, and do a good job in the work of canteens, dormitories, and clubs, to ensure that young workers have vigorous energy and a healthy leisure life.

With the widespread and in-depth development of the advanced producer movement, the work of the Communist Youth League in factories and mines must be raised to a new level. We must learn the working methods of the mass line, use the actual examples of advanced figures and advanced experience to drive the broad masses of young workers to learn from advanced producers and advance together with advanced producers. Cultivate and use all kinds of activists to carry out activities in all aspects and meet the various requirements of young workers. At the same time, the youth work departments of the Communist Youth League committees in various provinces and cities and all the Communist Youth League cadres in factories and mines must redouble their efforts to study and research the scientific and technological and management issues that promote the development of production in their regions, departments, and units. Without moving in this direction, it will be impossible to help the Party solve practical problems in production, it will be impossible to give full play to the shock role of the Communist Youth League organizations, and therefore it will be impossible to make due contributions to the entire movement. We believe that under the close leadership of the Party and with the concerted efforts of trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations, the advanced producer movement will surely achieve more widespread and greater results.

    青年团中央关于组织广大青年职工积极投入先进生产者运动的指示
    我国广大职工群众在党中央和毛主席的又多又快又好又省地进行社会主义建设的伟大号召下，劳动的积极性和创造性日益高涨，先进生产者不断涌现，提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的口号已经成为全国职工的实际行动。为了更全面地促进劳动竞赛和社会主义群众运动的新高涨，中华全国总工会已经发布了关于开展先进生产者运动的决议。先进生产者运动的开展将促进我国劳动生产率和我国工人阶级的技术水平的迅速提高，将使我国工人阶级的忠诚、勇敢、团结、前进的优良品质获得更大的发扬。青年团中央要求各级青年团的组织，要以最大的力量发动和帮助青年职工努力争取做一个先进生产者，使全国700万青年职工成为先进生产者运动中的一支最积极最活跃的力量，为我国经济和文化建设的新高涨而斗争。
    在党的培养和教育下，我国职工的年轻一代在劳动和学习中，表现了生气勃勃、勇于接受新事物的可贵特点。珍视和发扬这种特点，充分地组织他们的劳动积极性，不断地提高他们掌握新技术的能力，是工会和青年团组织的共同责任。为此，青年团组织要在工作中具有充分的主动精神，根据各个产业的特点和当前生产的主要要求，在青年职工中发起和组织各种生产活动，创立一些适合青年特点的多种多样的工作形式，来吸引和组织更多的青年职工在整个社会主义竞赛中发挥突击作用。那种只作一般号召而不组织各种具体活动、只满足于开会动员而不进行细致的组织工作是不对的。我们应当经常注意防止形式主义现象的产生。现在，各地青工所已经开展的“优等产品质量”、“快速切削和节约金属”、“百台落纱不断头”等活动，组织青年突击队，培养青年先进生产班、组，组织不同工种的青年班、组和青年突击手间的竞赛。建立青年监督岗、节约队等办法。在实际工作中已经证明有良好的效果，各地团的组织应当协同工会根据自己的情况加以适当运用。
    学习先进经验、掌握新技术、提高文化科学知识，是青年职工的一项迫切要求，也是开展先进生产者运动的中心环节。青年团组织应当协同行政、工会广泛地举办先进工作法训练班、业余技术学校和业余文化学校、订立师徒合同和互助合同，召开同工种的技术会议，使得青年工人都能够成为先进经验和新技术的最积极的学习者。在组织青年劳动的同时，还必须很好地关心青年工人的健康和休息，逐步改善青年工人的生活条件，把食堂、宿舍和俱乐部的工作办好，以保证青年工人有旺盛的精力，并使他们获得健康的业余生活。
    随着先进生产者运动广泛而深入的展开，青年团在厂矿企业中的工作必须提高到新的水平上来。我们必须学会群众路线的工作方法，运用先进人物和先进经验的实际事例，来带动广大青年职工向先进生产者看齐，和先进生产者一齐前进。培养和运用各种各样的积极分子，来开展各方面的活动，满足青年职工的各种要求。同时，各省市团委的青工部门和一切厂矿企业的团的干部，都必须加倍努力学习和研究推动本地区、本部门、本单位生产发展的科学技术和经营管理问题。不朝着这个方向前进，就不可能帮助党解决生产中的实际问题，就不可能充分的发挥青年团组织的突击作用，因而也就不可能对整个运动作出应有的贡献。我们相信，在党的密切领导下，工会和青年团组织一致努力，先进生产者运动一定会获得更加广泛和巨大的成果。
