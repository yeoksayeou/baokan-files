    Applied Chemistry Research Institute Successfully Trial-Produces Four Types of Synthetic Rubber
    After five years of research, the Applied Chemistry Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has successively trial-produced four types of synthetic rubber. Some of the research results have been provided to industrial departments as a basis for design and factory construction and production. In the research and trial production of synthetic rubber, the researchers have also compiled more than 30 research reports, and some research work has reached a relatively high scientific level. Synthetic rubber is made from materials such as alcohol and acetylene through chemical synthesis methods. It can be used as an elastic structural material (such as car tires) and electrical insulation material. Some synthetic rubbers have better wear resistance, oil resistance, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and temperature resistance than natural rubber.
    Through several years of research on synthetic rubber and natural rubber, researchers at the Applied Chemistry Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have laid a preliminary foundation for further research in the future.

    应用化学研究所试制成功四种人造橡胶
    中国科学院应用化学研究所经过五年的研究，已经先后试制成功四种人造合成橡胶。其中一部分研究结果已经提供产业部门作为设计和建厂生产的依据。研究人员在研究试制合成橡胶中，还先后编写了三十多篇研究工作报告，有些研究工作已经达到比较高的科学水平。合成橡胶是利用酒精、乙炔等材料，通过化学合成方法制成的。它可以用作弹性结构材料（如汽车轮胎等）和电绝缘材料等，有的合成橡胶在耐磨、耐油、耐蚀、耐热、耐温的性能上，具有比天然橡胶更优良的特点。
    中国科学院应用化学研究所研究人员通过几年来在合成橡胶和天然橡胶方面的研究工作，为今后进一步开展进行研究奠定了初步基础。
