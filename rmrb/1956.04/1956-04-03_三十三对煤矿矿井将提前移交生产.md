    Thirty-Three Pairs of Coal Mine Shafts Will Be Put Into Production Ahead of Schedule
    Among the state-owned coal mine shafts currently under construction, thirty-three pairs of shafts can be put into production ahead of the schedule determined by the Ministry of Coal Industry at the beginning of this year.
    Among these thirty-three pairs of shafts, eighteen pairs were originally planned to be put into production this year, but can now be put into production one to four months ahead of schedule; ten pairs of shafts were originally scheduled to be put into production next year, but can now be put into production in the second half of this year. The original plan for state-owned coal mines was to add fifty pairs of new shafts this year, but this will now increase to sixty pairs; the production capacity of the newly added shafts will increase by one-third compared to the original plan.
    The main reason these shafts can be put into production ahead of schedule is that, when discussing plans, the staff and workers of each mine construction team paid attention to comprehensively promoting advanced experience and adopted effective technical measures, which greatly accelerated the construction speed.
    The national state-owned coal mine system plans to start construction on thirty-eight pairs of new mine shafts this year, nearly doubling the number of new mine shafts originally planned to be started this year in the Five-Year Plan. In the first quarter, nine pairs of mine shafts have already started construction one after another; the other twenty-nine pairs of mine shafts are actively preparing for construction to begin.

### 三十三对煤矿矿井将提前移交生产

    三十三对煤矿矿井将提前移交生产
    正在建设的国营煤矿矿井中，有三十三对矿井可以比煤炭工业部今年年初确定的计划提前移交生产。
    在这三十三对矿井中，有十八对是原来计划在今年移交生产的，现在可以提前一个月到四个月移交生产；有十对矿井原来准备在明年移交生产，现在可以提前在今年下半年移交生产。国营煤矿原来计划在今年新增加五十对矿井，现在将增加到六十对；新增加的矿井的生产能力，将比原计划增加三分之一。
    这些矿井能够提前移交生产的主要原因，是各建井队职工在讨论计划的时候，注意全面推广先进经验，并且采取有效的技术措施，使施工速度大大加快。
    全国国营煤矿系统计划在今年开工兴建三十八对新矿井，比五年计划中原定在今年开工的新矿井增加将近一倍。第一季度，有九对矿井已经先后动工兴建；另外的二十九对矿井，正在积极进行开工的准备工作。　（据新华社讯）
