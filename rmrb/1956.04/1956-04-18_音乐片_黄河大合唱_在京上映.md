The first Chinese musical film, "Yellow River Cantata," will premiere in Beijing on April 18th.

"Yellow River Cantata" was produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of the people's musician Xian Xinghai. The film primarily features the performance of the "Yellow River Cantata" by the Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on stage. At the same time, it utilizes the unique advantages of film art to shoot scenes that match the content and emotions of the songs, further expressing the artistic conception of the songs.

The song "Yellow River Cantata" includes "The Yellow River Boatman's Song," "Ode to the Yellow River," "Yellow River Ballad," "Dialogue by the River," "Yellow River Lament," "Defend the Yellow River," and "Roar, Yellow River!"

The "Yellow River Cantata" film selects excerpts from other films to realistically reflect the cruel slaughter of the Chinese people by the Japanese invaders, and the heroic struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party to overcome the invaders. The magnificent singing and the authentic images complement each other, and the grand spirit and vigorous emotions of the songs are well expressed.

    音乐片“黄河大合唱”在京上映
    我国第一部音乐片“黄河大合唱”将于本月十八日起在北京市上映。
    “黄河大合唱”是为了纪念人民音乐家冼星海逝世十周年，由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制成的。影片以表现中国人民解放军总政治部文工团在舞台上演唱的“黄河大合唱”为主，同时又利用电影艺术特具的有利条件，拍摄了和歌曲内容、情绪相吻合的场景，进一步把歌曲的意境表达出来。
    歌曲“黄河大合唱”包括“黄河船夫曲”、“黄河颂”、“黄水谣”、“河边对口曲”、“黄河怨”、“保卫黄河”、“怒吼吧！黄河”等歌。
    “黄河大合唱”影片中选取了其它影片的片断，把日寇对中国人民的残酷掠杀，和中国人民在党的领导下，英勇奋斗、战胜侵略者的情形真实地反映了出来。雄壮的歌声和真实的画面互相配合，歌曲的宏伟的气魄和昂扬的情绪也得到了较好的表现。
