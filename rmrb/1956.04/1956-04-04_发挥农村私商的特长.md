    In the process of transforming private merchants, the Qugou Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anyang County, Henan Province, restricted the enthusiasm of private merchants in operating certain small commodities needed by the masses. The staff of the Qugou Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative believed that: "Since private merchants have been transformed according to industry, they should not go outside to purchase goods." Some private merchants who went to other places to purchase some small commodities were immediately criticized by them.
    After discovering this problem, the leaders of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative criticized their above-mentioned erroneous understanding and helped the private merchants reconnect with their original supply relationships. Soon, these private merchants added more than sixty kinds of small commodities.
    This change in the Xigou Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative is necessary. The advantage of rural private merchants lies in their flexible business methods and their ability to understand and meet the needs of farmers for a variety of small commodities. In the process of transforming rural private merchants, attention should be paid to giving full play to this advantage.

    发挥农村私商的特长
    河南安阳县曲沟镇供销合作社在改造私商过程中，限制了私商经营为群众所需要的某些零星商品的积极性。曲沟镇供销合作社的工作人员认为：“私商既然按行业改造了，就不应该到外边进货。”有的私商到外地进点细小商品，马上就受到他们的批评。
    供销合作社的领导人员发现了这个问题后，批判了他们的上述错误认识，并且帮助私商接上了他们原有的进货关系。不久，这些私商便添进了六十多种零星商品。
    西沟镇供销合作社的这种改变是必要的。农村私商的长处，就在于他们经营方式灵活，善于了解和满足农民对多种零星商品的需要。在改造农村私商的过程中，应该注意发挥他们的这个特长。
