How Should the Cooperative Management Committee Lead the Production Team
Li Yuezhong

After the agricultural production cooperative of Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, implemented the contract work system in 1955, two situations emerged from the perspective of the management committee's leadership methods: One was that the management committee members were assigned to various production teams and played a backbone role within each team; however, the issue of how the management committee should lead the production of the entire cooperative was neglected and not well resolved. This approach was almost equivalent to abolishing the management committee, often resulting in each member acting independently, "working for their assigned team" (e.g., competing for fertilizer, failing to mobilize labor when needed), leading to departmentalism and hindering the implementation of the cooperative's overall production plan. The other situation was that after the implementation of the contract work system, the cooperative's leaders (especially the cooperative director) developed a sense of relaxation, believing that "the burden was off" and that "something was holding the members together, everyone knows what to do," thus relaxing their overall leadership of production. The past chaos of the management committee was now shifted to the team leaders. The team leaders were scrambling every day, lacking a plan. Especially during the busy farming season, they often focused on one thing and neglected another. Often, if work wasn't scheduled the day before, no one would go to the fields the next day. Members didn't know what they would be doing tomorrow, and every morning after breakfast, they would gather to listen to the team leader's instructions, and after finding work, they would have to go back to get their farm tools, wasting a lot of time and causing serious idleness. As a result, production couldn't keep up, and the enthusiasm of the members couldn't be raised. Some production team leaders were very dissatisfied that the management committee only assigned work without specific inspection or assistance, saying, "You've pushed the responsibility away after the contract, giving me a difficult problem. I don't want to bother with it!" Therefore, the contract work became a formality, and the production plan was often not completed.

These facts educated the cooperative's leaders, and they understood that if they did not strengthen the leadership of the production teams, they would lose the unified leadership role of the management committee and seriously affect the completion of the production plan. They consciously criticized their complacency and began to specifically help the production teams improve their work.

How to Arrange Work in Production Teams

After research and discussion, it was understood that the central key to production team leadership was to arrange work in segments and implement the responsibility system.

In 1955, after they contracted the farm work to the production teams, the method of arranging labor was to "grasp three heads" in segments (grasp farm work, grasp time, grasp members' self-reported workdays). That is to say: according to the production tasks assigned by the entire cooperative, arrange work within the team every three to ten days (according to the experience of the Dongfanghong Cooperative, work can be arranged every ten days or so during the slack season, and it is best to arrange it every three days during the busy farming season, which is "three-head busy", so the time is short, the changes are small, and it is easy to grasp; in short, a flexible short-term work plan should be formulated, and it should not be mechanically stipulated that it should be done every few days). Within these few days, all public and private, large and small tasks are listed, the time is carefully calculated, and the work is prioritized and arranged in a unified manner according to the needs of production. Then, let the members self-report how many workdays they can do in this short period. If the self-reported workdays are not enough, efforts must be made to tap the labor potential; if there are surplus workdays, the management committee must be reported to find ways to make full use of them. When arranging, attention should be paid to the possible changes due to climate variations (that is to say, two sets of plans for sunny and rainy days can be made in advance in the short arrangement), and then, labor should be divided according to labor strength, technical expertise, and divided into several temporary production groups according to the type of work in this segment. It must be clearly pointed out here: the purpose of grouping is to rationally use labor and avoid confusion, not to assign someone a piece of land and let them be responsible for all the work on that land all year round. Otherwise, it may hinder the unified use of labor, land and other means of production.

As a result, the team leader's work became easier, and the members also felt that they "had a clue," and their sense of responsibility was strengthened. The benefits are: First, after finishing a section, summarize it, and arrange another section. It can timely check and find problems in production, and overcome shortcomings in time, which can ensure the implementation of the production plan. Second, it can effectively solve the contradiction between public and private affairs. Third, it can divide labor according to the different nature of the work and give play to the enthusiasm of various labor forces. Fourth, group production according to the work, each group has a group leader to "lead", the responsibility is clear, the scope of the scheduling is small, as long as a few words are enough when dismissing work, reducing the trouble of the team's daily unified scheduling, and strengthening the members' initiative in production. They have established two responsibility systems in the production team: One is the field management responsibility system. The technicians of each team are responsible for watching the water and watering early and late. Some production teams separate people to take care of different crops. The responsibility of the caretaker is to grasp the seasonal heat and promptly make suggestions to the team leader, and promptly discover problems (such as finding insect pests, needing irrigation or processing and cultivation, etc.), and provide it to the team for research. The advantage of this method is that it is easy to study cultivation techniques and comprehensively improve production. The other is the responsibility system for the safekeeping of cattle and farm implements. Small farm implements are kept by households, and the team's custodian is responsible for regular inspections; cattle are raised by a fixed person (four shi of grain are paid for one cow per year), and regular evaluations and inspections are carried out, and model cattle breeders are rewarded; large farm implements are also managed by a special person.

How the Management Committee Leads the Production Team

In addition to helping the teams improve their leadership methods, the management committee has a lot of work to do.

They have grasped the plan management, that is, grasp the production season and the key links to increase production, according to the requirements of the state, mobilize the members to make rationalization proposals, find ways to increase production, revise the production plan in a timely manner, and make short-term production arrangements, so as to specifically allocate production tasks to the teams, implement the measures to increase production, and help and guide the production of the teams through the plan; and according to the production plan, timely supply the production materials needed by each team. Before each major production season is about to arrive and new measures to increase production are implemented, the management committee first checks the preparation of various production materials. If it is found that some production tools are not sufficient or other things needed for production are not fully prepared, they should be supplemented as soon as possible to ensure timely supply.

After the contract work, there is a kind of secret competition among the teams; if this phenomenon is not paid attention to and led, it will become unled free competition of departmentalism, which is not conducive to production; if it is carried out with leadership, it will play a great role in promoting production. They understood this and strengthened the leadership of the competition among the teams in a timely manner.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the teams, the management committee also established an inspection team to check the production situation, cultivation quality, field management, cattle raising, public property safekeeping and other work of the teams at any time. They also established a contact system between the management committee and the production team leaders. The system stipulates that the team leaders should be absorbed to participate when the management committee formulates the contract work plan each time; the management committee should hold a meeting to specifically check the leadership of the production team every half month, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and exchange experience in leading production. When new problems appear in the team, it should be reported to the cooperative immediately and asked for instructions on the handling method.

Giving play to the collective leadership role of the management committee is an important guarantee for realizing comprehensive leadership. The management committee members have clear divisions of labor (in charge of finance, safekeeping, agricultural technology, political work, etc.), each is responsible for their own duties, finds problems, studies them collectively, and solves them in a unified manner. At the same time, each member contracts to lead a production team, and its specific task is to regularly participate in the collective labor of the team, and from daily labor and daily life, timely discover problems and specifically assist the work of the production team leader. The management committee and the cooperative director also grasp a production team as a key point, and timely create experience in plan management, grasping the key to increasing production, and rationally calculating labor remuneration, so as to drive the entire cooperative.

    合作社管委会应该怎样领导生产队
    李岳忠
    湖北省浠水县望城乡的农业生产合作社1955年实行包工制以后，从管委会的领导方法上来看，出现了两种情况：一种是管理委员分工到各个生产队，在各个队内发挥了骨干作用；但是，管委会如何领导全社生产的问题被忽视了，没有很好地解决。这样做，几乎等于取消了管委会，往往是各个委员各自为政，“在那一队为那一队”（如互相争夺肥料，需要调动劳动力的时候调不动），产生了本位主义思想，阻碍了全社的生产计划的贯彻执行。另一种情况是包工后社内领导人员（特别是社主任）产生了一种松气的情绪，认为包工后“担子卸了”，“有个东西把社员箍住了，各人晓得搞”，放松了对生产的全面领导。过去管委会的忙乱现象搬到队长头上了。队长每天乱抓，缺少计划。特别是农忙的时候，更是抓了这头顾不了那头。常常是头天没排工，第二天就没有人下田。社员今天不晓得明天做什么事，每每吃过早饭集中来听队长发落，找到活路以后，又要回去拿农具，误了不少时间，出现严重的窝工现象。这样，生产一直赶不动，社员劳动积极性不能提高。有些生产队长看到管委会只布置工作，不具体检查，也不具体帮助，很不满意，说：“包了工你们就把责任推了个干净，交个难题给我。我也懒管得哩！”因此，包工流于形式，常常完不成生产计划。
    这些事实教育了社内领导人员，他们懂得了：如果不加强对生产队的领导，就会失去管委会统一领导的作用，就会严重影响生产计划的完成。他们自觉地批判了自己的自满松懈情绪，开始具体帮助各生产队改进工作。
  生产队怎样安排工作
    经过研究讨论，了解到生产队领导生产的中心关键在于分段安排工作和贯彻执行责任制。
    1955年他们把农活包到生产队以后，安排劳动力的方法是按段“抓三头”（抓农活，抓时间，抓社员自报工作日）。就是说：根据全社布置的生产任务，队内三天到十天安排一次工作（根据东方红社的经验，农闲期间可以十天左右安排一次，在“三头忙”的农忙季节最好三天安排一次，这样时间短、变化小，容易掌握；总之，要灵活制定小段作业计划，不能机械规定几天一次）。在这几天之内，把公私、大小工作通通排列出来，仔细计算时间，按照生产的需要，把工作分出先后、缓急，统一安排。然后，让社员自报自己在这一小段能做多少工作日。自报的工作日不够用，就要设法挖掘劳动潜力；有多余的工作日，就要报告管委会设法充分利用。在安排的时候，要注意到可能因气候的变异而发生的变化（就是说在短安排中可以预先作出天晴、天雨的两套计划），然后，按劳力强弱、技术专长进行分工，根据这段工作的种类，分成几个临时生产小组。这里必须明确地指出：分组是为了合理使用劳动力，避免混乱，并不是谁分下那块地，就让他常年负责那块土地上的全部工作。不然，就可能妨碍统一地使用劳动力、土地和别的生产资料。
    这样做的结果，队长的工作好做了，社员也感到“有了头绪”，责任心加强了。它的好处是：一、做完一段，总结一段，布置一段，能及时检查发现生产中的问题，及时克服缺点，能够保证生产计划的贯彻执行。二、能够切实解决公事私事的矛盾。三、可以按工作的不同性质分工，发挥各种劳动力的积极性。四、按活分组生产，每组有一组长“领头”，责任明确，排工范围小，只要散工的时候三言两语就行了，减少了队里每天统一排工的麻烦，加强了社员在生产上的主动性。他们在生产队里建立了两种责任制：一是田间管理责任制。由各队的技术员早、晚负责看水、上水。有的生产队根据不同的作物分开专人看管。看管的责任是掌握季节火候，及时向队长提出建议，及时发现问题（如发现虫害，需要灌溉或加工培育等），提供队内研究。这个办法的好处是便于研究耕作技术，全面搞好生产。一是耕牛、农具保管责任制。小型农具分户保管，由队内保管员负责定期检查；耕牛由队固定专人饲养（一条牛一年给四石谷报酬），定期评比检查，奖励养牛模范；大型农具也由专人负责保管。
  管委会怎样领导生产队
    除了帮助各队改进领导方法以外，管委会还有许多工作做。
    他们抓紧了计划管理，就是抓住生产季节和增产环节，根据国家要求，发动社员提合理化建议，找寻增产门路，适时修订生产计划，做好短期生产安排，以便具体地向各队分配生产任务，贯彻执行增产措施，通过计划帮助和指导各队的生产；并且根据生产计划，适时供应各队所需要的生产资料。在每个大的生产季节快要到来和实行新的增产措施的时候，管委会就先检查一下各种生产资料的准备情况。如果发现哪些生产工具不够使用或生产上所需用的别的东西准备不充分，就赶紧补足，做到按时供应。
    包工以后，各队之间都带着一种暗地竞赛的劲头；这种现象如果不注意领导起来，就会成为无领导的本位主义的自由竞争，对生产不利；如果有领导地开展起来，对生产就会起极大的推动作用。他们了解了这一点，及时地对各队之间的竞赛加强了领导。
    管委会为了加强对各队的领导，还成立了检查组，随时检查各队的生产情况、耕作质量、田间管理、耕牛饲养、公共财物保管等工作。他们还建立了管理委员会和生产队长的联系制度。制度中规定管委会每次制定包工计划的时候要吸收各生产队长参加；管委会每半月要召开一次专门检查对生产队的领导的会议，开展批评和自我批评，交流领导生产的经验。队里有新问题出现的时候，要马上向社报告，请示处理办法。
    发挥管委会的集体领导作用，是实现全面领导的重要保证。管理委员有了明确的分工（分管财务、保管、农业技术、政治工作等），各负其责，发现问题，集体研究，统一解决。同时，每个委员都包干领导一个生产队，其具体任务是经常参加队的集体劳动，从日常劳动中和日常生活中，及时发现问题，具体协助生产队长的工作。管委会和社主任还掌握一个生产队作重点，及时在计划管理、抓增产关键、合理计算劳动报酬等方面创造经验，带动全社。
