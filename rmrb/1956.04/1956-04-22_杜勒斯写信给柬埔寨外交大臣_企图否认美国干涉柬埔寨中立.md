Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th - Phnom Penh Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, on April 19th, delivered a letter to Cambodian Foreign Minister Long Kim Nhien through the U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia, McClintock. In this letter, Dulles attempted to ease the strong resentment in Cambodian public opinion towards U.S. interference, trying his best to portray the U.S. as a friend of Cambodia.

In the letter, Dulles categorically denied the fact that the U.S. had used various pressures to force Cambodia to abandon its neutral policy. He said he "regretted" the rumors that the U.S. had used methods such as withholding economic aid and directing South Vietnam and Thailand to take economic blockade measures to force Cambodia to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Because, it is said, "these statements are completely untrue."

Dulles's words seem to be an attempt to deny the accusations against the U.S. made in a series of speeches by Prince Sihanouk, who recently resigned as Prime Minister of Cambodia. In a speech on April 6th, Sihanouk said, "Cambodia's neutrality is viewed with hostility by the United States."

In the letter, Dulles also evaded the fact that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization had already included Cambodia in its "protected area," and talked at length about the U.S. "respect" for Cambodia's "choice" not to participate in military blocs.

Regarding this point, Sihanouk also said in that speech: "The United States is not satisfied with Cambodia not joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Dulles also emphasized in the letter that the U.S. wanted to "help the Cambodian government maintain the sovereignty and independence of the kingdom" through its military and economic "aid." However, according to a communiqué issued by the Royal Government of Cambodia on April 19th, U.S. Ambassador McClintock met with and informed the King and Queen of Cambodia on April 17th that the U.S. agreed that the Cambodian government could use the U.S. "aid" counterpart funds for non-military aspects of the Kingdom's budget, and not just for the military budget. McClintock also assured the King and Queen of Cambodia that "U.S. aid to Cambodia is not attached to any conditions that may undermine Cambodia's independence and neutrality."

The Associated Press described this matter as a "last-minute action taken by the U.S. Embassy to resolve the main differences between Cambodia and the United States." This is because the Cambodian ruling party, the People's Socialist Community, is scheduled to hold a national congress on April 21st. This congress will discuss Cambodia's foreign policy issues.

### 杜勒斯写信给柬埔寨外交大臣  企图否认美国干涉柬埔寨中立

    杜勒斯写信给柬埔寨外交大臣
    企图否认美国干涉柬埔寨中立
    新华社河内20日电  金边消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯四月十九日通过美国驻柬埔寨大使麦克林托克交给柬埔寨外交大臣龙金尼一封信。杜勒斯在这封信中企图缓和柬埔寨舆论对美国干涉的强烈反感，竭力把美国说成是柬埔寨的朋友。
    杜勒斯在信中矢口否认美国曾经使用各种压力来强迫柬埔寨放弃中立政策的事实。他说，他对所传美国曾经以不给予经济援助和指使南越和泰国采取经济封锁的办法来强迫柬埔寨加入东南亚条约组织的说法“感到遗憾”。因为，据说“这些说法完全是不确实的”。
    杜勒斯的这些话看来是想否认最近辞去柬埔寨首相职务的西哈努克亲王最近一连串演说中对美国的指责。西哈努克在四月六日发表的谈话中就曾经说，“柬埔寨的采取中立受到美国的仇视。”
    杜勒斯在这封信中还避开了东南亚条约组织早已把柬埔寨划入它的“保护地区”的事实，而大谈美国“尊重”柬埔寨不愿参加军事集团的“选择”。
    关于这一点，西哈努克在那次谈话中也曾经说过：“美国不满意柬埔寨不加入东南亚条约组织”。
    杜勒斯在信中还强调，美国想要通过它的军事和经济“援助”来“帮助柬埔寨政府保持王国的主权和独立”。而据柬埔寨王国政府四月十九日发表的公报说，美国大使麦克林托克曾经在四月十七日进见和通知柬埔寨国王和王后说，美国同意柬埔寨政府可以把美“援”对等基金用在王国预算的非军事方面，而不仅用在军事预算方面。麦克林托克还向柬埔寨国王和王后保证，“美国对柬埔寨的援助并不附有任何可能损害柬埔寨的独立和中立条件。”
    美联社把这件事情说成是美国大使馆“为了解决柬埔寨和美国的主要分歧而采取的最后一分钟行动”。因为，柬埔寨的执政党人民社会同盟即将在四月二十一日举行全国代表大会。这次大会将讨论柬埔寨的外交问题。
