    Educate the Masses to Not Indiscriminately Cut Down Trees
    To the Editor:
    Last winter and this spring, our office sent working groups to various regions to understand the situation of forest protection and management. We discovered that in some areas of Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hunan, Shandong, Guizhou, and other provinces, the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging of forests is very serious.
    Why has the serious phenomenon of indiscriminate logging occurred in some areas? The main reason is that the leading organs in these areas have not conducted diversified management based on local natural conditions and the characteristics of agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production in mountainous areas, but have one-sidedly emphasized wasteland reclamation on steep slopes to increase grain production. For example, in Xiliu Village, Jinxian District, Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, Yin Hongjiu and two other households cut down more than 2,000 trees for wasteland reclamation and production. In Huanglaxi Township, Yuanling County, Hunan Province, farmer Wang Yunzhu cut down more than 9,000 fir and pine trees to grow coarse grains. The wood cut down in these areas is often impossible to be fully utilized. According to incomplete statistics from the Jinhua Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Zhejiang Province, 110,000 timber logs cut down in Songyang, Jinyun, and other five counties in 1955 have not been sold.
    In some areas, improper handling of the issue of forest entry into the cooperative during the establishment of fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives, or insufficient publicity of policies, causing some farmers to worry, is also an important reason for the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging. For example, when the Liuhe Township, Zhaowang District, Hu County, Shaanxi Province, established advanced cooperatives, the phenomenon of farmers cutting down trees occurred due to improper handling of forestland.
    In addition, the use of firewood as fuel by factories and mines in some places has also prompted farmers to indiscriminately cut down trees for sale. For example, iron factories in Zhen'an, Ningshan, and other counties in Shaanxi Province need 6 million catties of charcoal per year, equivalent to 60 million catties of firewood. If calculated at 300 catties of firewood per tree, approximately 200,000 trees need to be cut down each year. This is a serious waste of the country's forest resources!
    Forests are an important resource for national construction and an important guarantee for improving natural conditions. In order to adapt to the needs of national construction, large-scale forestry construction is currently underway nationwide. Therefore, forest protection work should be done even better, and the man-made destruction of forests such as indiscriminate logging and deforestation for wasteland reclamation should be eliminated. We put forward the following suggestions, hoping that the leading organs in various regions will pay attention to them so that they can jointly do a good job in forest management and protection.
    First, in forest areas, semi-forest areas, and areas where mountains are closed for afforestation, forestry policies should be deeply publicized and resolutely implemented in close combination with the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production, and the masses should be led and educated to scientifically manage forests, achieve rational felling and utilization, and organize the masses to do a good job in forest protection to ensure forest safety.
    Second, trade and cooperation departments should implement the forest protection policy when purchasing firewood, charcoal, and timber, strengthen planning, strictly control the quantity of purchases, and do a good job in educating the masses and organizing purchases to prevent the phenomenon of blindly cutting down trees so as not to cause major losses to the country. For industrial and mining units in various places that still use wood as fuel, relevant leading organs and forestry departments should help them switch to coal or other fuels as much as possible.
    Finally, forestry departments should regularly go deep into forest areas to inspect forest protection work, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, commend areas, units, and individuals that have done a good job in forest protection work, criticize and educate those that have not done a good job in forest protection work, and demand that judicial organs punish bad elements who damage forest resources according to law.

### 教育群众不要滥伐林木

    教育群众不要滥伐林木编辑同志：
    去冬今春我处曾派工作组到各地了解森林保护管理工作的情况，发现在浙江、广东、湖南、山东、贵州等省某些地区滥伐森林的现象很严重。
    为什么在某些地区产生了滥伐林木的严重现象呢？主要原因是，这些地区的领导机关没有根据当地自然条件以及山区农业、林业、牧业和副业生产的特点，进行多种经营，而片面地强调在陡坡山地开荒增产粮食。像浙江省缙云县缙仙区西流村尹洪究等三户，因为开荒生产就砍伐林木二千多株。湖南省沅陵县黄腊溪乡农民汪云注因为要种杂粮，就砍去杉树、松树九千多株。这些地区砍下的木材，也往往不可能被完全利用起来。据浙江省金华专署的不完全统计，1955年松阳、缙云等五县砍下的林木，还有十一万根没有卖掉。
    有些地区在建立完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社的时候，对林木入社问题处理不当，或者对政策宣传得不透，引起有些农民的顾虑，也是造成滥伐林木现象的一个重要原因。如陕西省鄠县赵王区六合乡建立高级社的时候，就因为对林木处理不当，以致发生了农民砍树的现象。
    此外，有些地方的厂矿部门使用木柴为燃料，也促使农民滥伐林木出卖。如陕西镇安、宁陕等县的铁工厂一年需要木炭六百万斤，折合木柴达六千万斤，如果以每株树出三百斤木柴计算，每年约需砍伐二十万株树。这是祖国森林资源的严重浪费！
    森林，是祖国建设的重要资源，也是改良自然条件的重要保证。为了适应祖国建设的需要，目前全国正在进行大规模的林业建设。因此，更应该做好护林工作，杜绝滥砍树木、毁林开荒等人为的破坏森林的现象。我们提出以下意见，希望各地领导机关注意，以便共同做好森林的管理保护工作。
    首先，在林区、半林区以及封山育林地区，应该密切结合农业合作化运动和农业生产，深入宣传和坚决执行林业政策，领导和教育群众科学地经营森林，做到合理采伐利用，并且组织群众做好护林工作，保证森林的安全。
    其次，贸易、合作部门在收购木柴、木炭和木材的时候应该贯彻护林方针，加强计划性，严格控制收购数量，并且做好对群众的教育工作和收购的组织工作，防止盲目砍伐林木的现象，以免造成国家的重大损失。对于各地仍然用木材作燃料的工矿单位，有关领导机关和林业部门应该尽可能帮助它们改用煤炭或其他燃料。
    最后，林业部门应该经常深入林区检查护林工作，发现问题及时解决，对护林工作做得好的地区、单位和个人应该进行表扬，对护林工作做得不好的要提出批评并进行教育，对于破坏森林资源的坏分子应该要求司法机关依法惩处。
