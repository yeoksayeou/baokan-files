    Wuhan Market Before the "May 1st" Holiday

    Wuhan's silk and cloth, and department stores have been particularly crowded lately. Customers are coming in droves to purchase fabrics and clothing, preparing to celebrate the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

    In front of the glass counters and shelves displaying floral fabrics and clothing in various stores, young women shuttle back and forth, looking and choosing repeatedly. The largest department store in Wuhan, the state-owned department store's central branch, and the largest silk and cloth store, the joint state-private Jianghan Silk and Cloth Company, have been selling nearly 10,000 feet of floral fabric per day on average in the past week. From March 1st to April 20th, the Wuhan branch of the China Cotton and Linen Company sold floral fabrics equivalent to 90% of its total floral fabric sales for the entire year last year. A saleswoman at the clothing counter of the state-owned department store's central branch told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that dresses are the most popular with customers and sell the most.

    State-owned cotton and linen companies and banks, and other relevant departments, are actively helping various joint state-private stores solve difficulties such as insufficient funds, and simplifying various procedures so that these stores can replenish their stocks in a timely manner to meet the needs of the citizens. The Municipal Knitting and Cotton Weaving Company is processing and rushing to produce 20,000 dresses, qipaos, as well as new-style men's clothing and children's wear. The city's clothing companies and sewing production cooperatives are also very busy, and they began rushing to produce all kinds of festive clothing after entering April. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “五一”节前的武汉市场
    武汉市各绸布、百货商店最近显得特别拥挤，顾客成群地来选购布料和服装，准备欢度“五一”国际劳动节。
    在各商店摆着花布和服装的玻璃柜和货架前，年青姑娘们来回穿梭，看了又看，选了又选。武汉市最大的百货商店——国营百货公司中心门市部和最大的绸布商店——公私合营江汉绸布公司，最近一个星期内，平均每天要销售花布近一万尺。中国花纱布公司武汉市公司从三月一日到四月二十日，销售的花布相当于去年全年花布销售量的90％。国营百货公司中心门市部服装柜的营业员告诉新华社记者说，连衣裙最受顾客欢迎，销售得最多。
    国营花纱布公司和银行等有关部门，正积极帮助各公私合营商店解决资金不足等困难，并且简化各种手续，使这些商店能及时进货，满足市民的需要。市针棉织公司正在加工赶制两万件连衣裙、旗袍以及新式男服和童装。全市的服装公司和缝纫生产合作社也都非常忙碌，他们在进入四月以后，就开始赶制各式各样的节日服装。（新华社）
