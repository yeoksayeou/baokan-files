    Improving Enterprise Management, Accelerating Construction Speed
    National Construction Sites to Implement Unified Construction Quotas

    The 1956 Unified Construction Installation Engineering Quotas have recently been announced by the State Construction Commission and will be implemented at construction sites nationwide starting May 1st this year. This is a significant measure for construction and installation enterprises across the country to improve enterprise management, further increase labor productivity, and accelerate construction speed.

    The 1956 Unified Construction Installation Engineering Quotas include three parts: labor quotas, material consumption quotas, and construction machinery labor quotas. It serves as the basis for construction units to issue engineering task orders (including limited material requisition cards), prepare construction organization designs and construction operation plans, settle piece-rate wages, and for the state to compile budget quotas. Therefore, the announcement of this unified construction quota will encourage the broad masses of workers to learn from advanced experiences and enhance their technical skills.

    The 1956 Unified Construction Installation Engineering Quotas are the first unified national construction quotas compiled since the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the past few years, various regions and departments across the country have separately compiled labor quotas, material consumption quotas, or construction machinery quotas within the construction quotas. However, because these quotas were compiled in a decentralized manner, the quota levels were very inconsistent. This not only made it difficult for the state to have a unified standard to measure the quality of enterprises' work, but also often resulted in unreasonable phenomena of unequal pay for equal work in the same region or the same department. At the same time, the state also lacked a unified basis for compiling budget quotas. In order to change this situation, the State Construction Commission began organizing relevant departments in June of last year, based on China's current construction technology and construction management level, as well as relevant provisions in existing laws and regulations, to compile unified national construction quotas. During the compilation of construction quotas, the opinions of the broad masses of workers were also absorbed.

    The 1956 Unified Construction Installation Engineering Quotas are divided into five volumes. Volumes one to four have been agreed upon by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and approved by the State Construction Commission and the Ministry of Labor. These four volumes are respectively applicable to general industrial and residential building engineering, general industrial equipment installation engineering, construction and installation engineering using machinery at construction sites, and construction and installation engineering for railways, highways, hydraulic engineering, weak current communications, etc. Volume five is applicable to specialized engineering within the scope of various central ministries, and will be approved and promulgated by the respective ministries.

### 改善企业管理，加快建设速度  全国建筑工地将实行统一施工定额

    改善企业管理，加快建设速度
    全国建筑工地将实行统一施工定额
    1956年度建筑安装工程统一施工定额最近已经由国家建设委员会公布，并且将从今年五月一日起在全国建筑工地实行。这是全国建筑安装企业改善企业管理、进一步提高劳动生产率和加快建设速度的一项重大措施。
    1956年度建筑安装工程统一施工定额，包括劳动定额、材料消耗定额和建筑机械劳动定额三部分，它是施工单位签发工程任务单（包括限额领料卡片）、编制施工组织设计和施工作业计划、结算计件工资和国家编制预算定额的基础。因此，这个统一施工定额的公布，将能鼓舞广大职工学习先进经验和提高技术水平的积极性。
    1956年度建筑安装工程统一施工定额，是中华人民共和国成立以来第一次编制的全国统一的施工定额。过去几年中，全国各地和各部门曾经分别编制过施工定额中的劳动定额、材料消耗定额或建筑机械定额。但由于这些定额都是采取分散编制，定额水平很不一致，这样就不但使国家缺乏统一的尺度来衡量企业工作的好坏，而且在同一地区或同一部门往往发生同工不同酬的不合理现象。同时，国家编制预算定额也没有统一的基础。为了改变这种情况，国家建设委员会从去年六月开始组织有关部门，根据中国当前的施工技术和施工管理水平以及现行法令中的有关规定，着手编制全国统一的施工定额。在编制施工定额过程中，还吸收了广大职工的意见。
    1956年度建筑安装工程统一施工定额共分五册，第一册到第四册取得了中华全国总工会同意，并且经国家建设委员会和劳动部批准。这四册分别适用于一般工业和居住建筑工程、一般工业设备安装工程、施工现场使用机械施工的建筑安装工程和铁路、公路、水工、弱电通讯等建筑安装工程。第五册适用于中央各部所属范围的专业工程，由各部批准公布。
