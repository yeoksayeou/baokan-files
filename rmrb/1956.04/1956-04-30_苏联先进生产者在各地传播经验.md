    Soviet advanced producer delegations, invited to China to impart their advanced experience in heavy industry, machinery manufacturing, textiles, railways, coal mining, and construction, have recently returned to Beijing after performing and introducing their experiences in various locations. They are preparing to attend the National Advanced Producers Conference.
    After participating in advanced producer representative meetings for each industry in Beijing, these delegations departed for factories and mines in seventeen cities, including Anshan, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Taiyuan, to impart their advanced experiences. They introduced and demonstrated advanced Soviet production techniques in coal mining, machinery, textiles, and other fields to Chinese workers.
    The dissemination of advanced experience has enabled many workers in factories and mines across the country to learn new technologies and operational methods. For example, workers at the No. 143 copper smelting open-hearth furnace in the Shanghai Smelting Plant, under the guidance of Soviet heavy industry advanced producer Ankudinov, set a new record on April 26th by shortening the smelting time for one furnace of copper by four hours and thirty-five minutes. Soviet fast tunneling advanced producer in metal mines, Sabinin, helped workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Gongchangling Iron Mine improve their operating methods. The tunneling efficiency of workers in Ye Changsheng's group and others has increased by 30%. After the Soviet advanced machinery manufacturing workers Kovalenko, Lenkov, and Kaltienko demonstrated advanced technology at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, driller Dong Yinchong learned to tap threaded holes on the drilling machine, increasing production efficiency by 21.6 times.

    苏联先进生产者在各地传播经验
    应邀来我国传授先进经验的苏联重工业、机械制造、纺织、铁路、煤矿、建筑等先进生产者代表团，在各地表演介绍经验后，最近两天已经陆续回到北京，准备参加全国先进生产者代表会议。
    这些代表团在北京参加了各产业的先进生产者代表会议以后，就分别出发到鞍山、上海、西安、太原等十七个城市的厂矿企业传授先进经验。他们在各地向我国职工分别介绍和表演了苏联煤矿、机械、纺织等各方面的先进生产技术。
    先进经验的传授，已使各地厂矿的许多职工学会了许多新的技术和操作方法。例如上海冶炼厂一四三号炼铜平炉工人，在苏联重工业先进生产者安库金诺夫的指导下，四月二十六日创造了缩短四小时三十五分钟熔炼一炉铜的新纪录。苏联金属矿山快速掘进先进生产者萨宾宁，帮助鞍山钢铁公司弓长岭铁矿工人改进了操作方法，叶长生等小组工人的掘进效率，已经提高了30％。苏联先进的机械制造业工人科瓦连科、连柯夫和卡尔坚科等，在太原矿山机械厂表演了先进技术后，钻工董银崇学会了在钻床上绞丝孔，使生产效率提高了二十一点六倍。
