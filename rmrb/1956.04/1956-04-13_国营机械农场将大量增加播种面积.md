Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    State-run mechanized farms across the country will increase their sown acreage by approximately 70% this year compared to last year. Total grain output is required to double compared to last year, and the average yield per mu for grain and cotton is required to increase by 30% to 40% compared to last year.

    To ensure the completion of this year's production tasks, various farms have recently launched competitions. For example, the Hubei Wusan Farm proposed a production target of 1,000 jin per mu for both paddy and dryland grain crops across the entire farm, challenging the State-run Friendship Farm and the Jiusan Farm, among others.

    This year, state-run mechanized farms nationwide will also adopt measures such as changing farming systems, promoting improved varieties, expanding multiple cropping areas, and increasing fertilizer application to improve the yield of various crops.

    Currently, production preparations at state-run mechanized farms have been basically completed. The selection of seeds has been finalized, and 80% of large tractors have undergone repairs. Meanwhile, spring plowing and sowing work has already begun in many state-run mechanized farms in provinces such as Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China.

    By the end of last year, there were already more than 100 state-run mechanized farms nationwide. More than fifty are planned to be established this year, some of which have already been built, and others are under active preparation.

    国营机械农场将大量增加播种面积
    全国国营机械农场今年播种面积将比去年增加约70％，粮食总产量要求比去年增加一倍，粮食和棉花每亩的平均产量要求比去年提高30％到40％。
    为了保证完成今年的生产任务，最近一个时期，各农场开展了竞赛。如湖北五三农场提出以完成全场水旱地粮食作物每亩一千斤的生产指标，向国营友谊农场和九三等农场挑战。
  今年，全国各国营机械农场还将以改变耕作制度、推广良种、扩大复种面积、增施肥料等措施来提高各种作物的产量。
    现在，各国营机械农场的生产准备工作已基本完成。种子的精选工作已经完毕，大型拖拉机也已有80％经过检修。同时，东北、华北、西北等省的许多国营机械农场的春耕播种工作已经开始。
    到去年年底，全国国营机械农场就已经有一百多个，今年还计划要建立的五十多个，现在有的已经建成，有的正在积极筹建。
