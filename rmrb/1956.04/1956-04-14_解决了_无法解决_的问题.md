    Solved the "Unsolvable" Problem
    Yuan Liang, Wen Tianshen

    The Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory guarantees to complete the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.
    This news surprised many people. People still remember that the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory was criticized and blamed from many aspects for its poor product quality and its failure to complete the plan for a long time. At that time, some people said that the switches on their high-voltage lines were "unable to open or close," which brought trouble to some key power station projects, and they had to send many technicians to help users with calibration and rework. The factory's production plan was unfulfilled month after month before August last year. After August, the situation improved somewhat, but it turned into "crash production every month." The factory was in a very difficult situation. Some employees were even unwilling to wear the factory badges, saying, "It's a shame to wear them!"
    Why does a factory like this in the past dare to make the loud guarantee of completing the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule today?
    We visited the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory and deeply felt the profound changes that have taken place in the factory since the Party Central Committee conveyed the instructions on opposing right-leaning conservatism and accelerating the speed of socialist construction. Now, walking into this factory, there is a tense atmosphere of labor everywhere. Whether in the workshop or in the team, whether in the general party branch, the factory director's or the trade union's office, workers, technicians, and staff can often be seen, carrying drawings, components, and new tool styles, excitedly reporting good news. A mass movement to improve technology and operation methods is developing vigorously under the leadership of the factory party organization and administration. It has solved and continues to solve problems that were previously considered impossible to solve.
      The oil-poor circuit breaker is one of the main products of the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory. If a generator or substation does not have an oil-poor circuit breaker, it will not be able to perform circuit breaking and blocking control after an accident. Its function is as important as the heart valve of people. However, since the establishment of the High-Voltage Switch Factory, the phenomenon of non-conforming installation of the most important part of the oil-poor circuit breaker—the buffer—has often occurred and has been considered an unsolvable technical problem. Even before February of this year, this was the case: after the product left the workshop and arrived at the inspection room, if the buffer installation was found to be non-compliant, it was customary to use levers to pry it, and hammers to tap it together to allow it to leave the factory. This is one of the reasons why the factory often sends technicians to various user units across the country for calibration and rework. Now, this phenomenon no longer occurs, and the assembly team workers have solved this technical problem.
    In January, the assembly team learned the assembly line operation method, changed the horizontal installation of the buffer on the oil-poor circuit breaker to vertical installation, and the inspector could use a ruler to check the installation specifications one by one. This inspection more clearly exposed the poor assembly quality. When discussing the national plan in early February, the assembly team proposed that the quality problem must be solved. They studied specific improvement methods and believed that a tool must be used to fix the position of the buffer during installation to ensure quality. The team entrusted the design and manufacture of the tool to team leader Jie Baochun and worker Yue Tingfu. With everyone's help, they manufactured a hollow pallet, which not only made the assembly accuracy reach 100%, but also greatly improved work efficiency. What used to take two people half an hour can now be done by one person in five minutes.
    In the past, people said: the poor quality and many rejects of the oil baffle are a major disaster in the production of high-voltage switches. The completion of the oil baffle production plan in the medium-voltage workshop has never been guaranteed. The workers said: "It's not worth doing this kind of work! Eight out of ten cars will break." When assigning work, people always pushed you and I pushed you, and no one wanted this job because it was "troublesome." When the lathe was started, it was either hitting the tool or stalling the car; either the inner circle was finished and the outer circle had problems, or the outer circle was finished and the inner circle was broken. A skilled worker can only produce 14 qualified semi-finished products at most after working hard for a day. The oil baffles could not be produced, and the subsequent welding, drilling and other processes were often suspended waiting for materials. When it came to the assembly workshop, the parts could not be assembled into sets, which affected the completion of the entire plan.
    Now, rejects and defective products in oil baffle production have disappeared, and work efficiency has been greatly improved. Two months can do a year's worth of work. And some apprentices with some operating experience can also work contentedly next to the rapidly rotating machine tool.
    This technical innovation is the result of the cooperation between the old worker Yin Baoyu and the technician Shi Jinsheng. They both seized this key issue of quality in early February, worked hard, and were not discouraged by the more than twenty setbacks and failures before the Spring Festival. On February 18, the tool they created was successful. This tool not only enabled the production of oil baffles to achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical," but also can be used to process 41 similar parts. People call it the "universal chuck."
    Following the emergence of the universal chuck, new tools and new operating methods emerged one after another in various workshops. In the complete set workshop, more than forty suggestions for improving tools were implemented in one month. When we visited this workshop, young punch worker Li Wanzhong was operating the automatic stock feeder for punches he created to process washers on oil circuit breakers. The machine tool made a uniform and harmonious sound, and the washers jumped out of the punch one after another automatically. In the past, processing this part required feeding one by one, punching one by one, and the eyes often felt sore. If the alignment was not accurate, defective products would be produced and the mold would be damaged. Now, this 100% quality-guaranteed, continuous automatic device is helping him complete the stamping task of 450,000 washers at a rate of seven times higher efficiency. The washers that need to be supplied in large quantities to all workshops in the factory will no longer wait for materials. The punch is also more obedient to people's command, and will no longer punch the washers off and scrap them.
    A long time ago, we knew that the poor quality of the stop frame was a key problem of Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory. Last year, the whole year was troubled by this issue, but the problem had not been solved, and the rejection rate was as high as 50%-60%; the situation in August and September was even more serious, because no stop frames were made, and no oil-poor circuit breakers were produced in the entire factory. This was mainly because the riveting was not up to specifications, and the accuracy of the hole position was not guaranteed. Now, fitter Ma Changan has trial-produced a precise eye-alignment drill, and used it for processing, so that the shaft holes on the stop frame can be directly processed on the drilling machine without riveting. In this way, not only is the quality 100% guaranteed and the output increased by 300%, but also the annual cost is reduced by 2,700 yuan.
      During our short stay in the workshop, we not only heard, but also saw, the rationalization proposals that were still being studied a few hours ago, and the tools that were still being improved, suddenly declared their birth, and people cheered for "breaking through another key." Layout worker Lv Hai recently proposed a suggestion to improve the drill, and after testing, the processing quality of the iron washers on the explosion-proof switch has been increased from a past qualification rate of 50% to 100%. And it saves the layout process before drilling.
    Now, a grand advanced producer movement is being carried out throughout the factory. The factory has established a system for quickly approving, summarizing and promoting advanced experience. The leaders of the Party organization, administrative departments, trade union, and Communist Youth League have strengthened direct in-depth inspections of workshops and teams, timely discovered and supported the advanced, and supervised and organized functional institutions to actively help workers realize rationalization proposals. The factory has also formulated a comprehensive plan for technical transformation throughout the year and a training plan to improve the technical level of employees, and will establish a scientific laboratory this year to strengthen measurement work to further ensure product quality.

    解决了“无法解决”的问题
    袁良　文天申
    沈阳高压开关厂保证提前一年完成第一个五年计划。
    这个消息使许多人感到惊奇。人们还记得沈阳高压开关厂因为产品质量低劣，长时期完不成计划，曾经受到多方面的批评和指责。那时候，有人说他们出产的高压线路上的开关是“开不开也关不上”，给一些重点工程的发电站带去祸患，他们不得不经常派出许多技术工人去帮助用户进行校正、返修。厂里的生产计划在去年八月以前是月月完不成，到了八月以后，情况有些好转，但是又变成“月月搞突击。”工厂的处境很狼狈。有些职工甚至不愿意佩戴厂里的证章，他们说：“戴上真丢人！”
    过去是这样一个工厂，为什么今天敢于提出提前一年完成第一个五年计划的响亮的保证呢？
    我们去访问沈阳高压开关厂，才深深感到，自从传达了党中央关于反对右倾保守、加快社会主义建设速度的指示之后，工厂里发生了多么深刻的变化。现在走进这个工厂，到处都是紧张的劳动气氛。无论在车间或小组里，无论在党总支、厂长或工会的办公室里，经常可以看到工人、技术人员和职员，带着图纸、部件和新的工具样式，兴致焕发地传报喜讯。一个改进技术、改进操作方法的群众运动，正在工厂党组织和行政的领导下，波澜壮阔地向前发展。它解决了、并且继续解决着过去认为根本无法解决的问题。
      贫油断路器是沈阳高压开关厂的主要产品之一。一个发电机或变电站如果没有贫油断路器，发生事故以后便无法进行断路、闭塞控制。它的作用就像人们心脏上的心门一样重要。可是自从有了高压开关厂以来，贫油断路器上最重要的部件——缓冲器安装不合要求的现象就时常发生，并且被认为是解决不了的技术问题。甚至在今年二月份以前还是这样：产品出了车间，到了检验室后发现缓冲器安装不合要求，便习惯地使用杠杆撬撬，鎯头敲敲凑合着让它出厂了。这就是厂里经常派出技术工人到全国各使用单位去进行校正、返修的根源之一。现在，这种现象不再发生了，装配小组的工人解决了这个技术问题。
    一月份，装配小组学习了流水作业法，把贫油断路器上的缓冲器由卧装改为立装，检查员可以用尺子一个一个检查安装的规格。这一检查，更明显地暴露出装配质量不好。二月初讨论国家计划的时候，装配小组提出一定要解决质量问题。他们研究了具体的改进方法，认为必须用一种工具在安装的时候把缓冲器的位置固定下来，才能保证质量。小组把工具的设计和制造任务委托给小组长颉宝春和工人岳亭富。在大家的帮助下，他们制造了一种空心托板，不但使装配的精确度达到100％，而且大大提高了工作效率，两个人半个小时的活，一个人在五分钟内便可以干出来。
    过去，人们都说：挡油板的质量差、废品多是高压开关厂生产上的一大灾难。中压车间挡油板生产计划的完成从来是没有保证的。工人们说：“干这种活，划不着！车十个就要坏八个。”在派活的时候，人们总是你推我我推你，谁也嫌这活“缠手”，车床一开动不是打刀就是闷车；不是内圆车好了外圆出了毛病，就是外圆车好后内圆又撑坏了。一个技术纯熟的工人，紧张地工作一天，顶多才能车14个合格的半成品。挡油板生产不出来，下面的焊接、钻孔等工序经常停工待料，到了装配车间零件不能成套，影响整个计划的完成。
    现在，挡油板生产中的废品、次品都消失了，工作效率也大大提高。两个月就能干出一年的活来。而且多少有些操作经验的徒工，也可以站在飞速旋转的机床旁边称心地工作了。
    这个技术上的革新，是老工人殷宝玉和技术员史今生合作的结果。他们两个在二月初抓住了这个质量方面的关键课题，勤奋钻研，春节以前的二十多次挫折和失败都没有使他们灰心。二月十八日，他们创造的工具成功了。这种工具不仅使挡油板的生产达到了“又多、又快、又好、又省”，而且可以用来加工41种同类的部件。人们称它“万能卡具”。
    紧接着万能卡具的出现，新的工具，新的操作方法在各个车间接二连三地涌现出来。在成套车间里，一个月内就有四十多项改进工具的建议实现了。我们访问这个车间的时候，青年冲床工李万忠正在操纵着他创造出的冲床自动挡料机，加工油断路器上的垫圈。机床上发出均匀而又和谐的响声，垫圈一个接着一个自动地从冲床上跳出来。过去加工这种零件要逐个喂料，逐个冲压，眼睛经常瞅得发酸，一下对得不准，就出废品，模具也要碰损。现在，这个100％保证质量的连发性的自动装置，正以提高效率七倍的速度，帮助他完成45万个垫圈的冲压任务。全厂各个车间需要大量供应的垫圈，就再不会待料了。冲床也更服贴地听人指挥，再不会把垫圈冲偏报废了。
    很早以前，我们就知道止架这种部件的质量不好，是沈阳高压开关厂的一个关键问题。去年整整闹了一年，问题一直得不到解决，废品率高到50％—60％；八、九两月份的情况更是严重，因为止架作不出来，贫油断路器全厂没有生产出一个来。这主要是因为铆接不合规格，孔位的精确度没有保证，现在钳工马常安试制出一种精密的对眼钻具，利用它来进行加工，使止架上的轴孔不用铆接，就能在钻床上直接对串加工。这样，不仅质量100％得到保证、产量提高300％，同时全年成本也降低了2，700元。
      在车间里短短的逗留中，我们不仅听到，也看到，几小时以前还在研究的合理化建议、还在改进的工具，霎时间就宣告诞生，人们为“又突破了一道关键”而欢呼起来。划线工吕海，不久前提出改进钻具的建议，经过试验，已经把防爆开关上的铁垫圈的加工质量，由过去50％的合格率，提高到100％。并且省去了一道钻孔前的划线工序。
    现在，一个壮阔的先进生产者运动正在全厂开展。厂里建立了迅速审批、总结和推广先进经验的制度。党组织、行政部门、工会、青年团的领导人加强了直接深入车间、小组的巡回检查，及时发现先进、支持先进，监督与组织职能机构积极帮助工人实现合理化建议。厂里还制定出全年技术改造的全面规划和提高职工技术水平的培训计划，并且要在今年内建立起科学实验室，加强计量工作，来进一步保证产品质量。
