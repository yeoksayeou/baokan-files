French physicist Pierre Curie died fifty years ago today, struck by a horse-drawn carriage at a time when he had made immense contributions to humanity and was poised to make even greater ones. This is a great loss to the scientific community!

Before the Curies met, Pierre Curie was already a renowned scientist. In 1880, at the young age of twenty-one, he and his brother Jacques Curie discovered the piezoelectric effect of crystals and created the piezoelectric crystal balance, which could use weights to measure tiny amounts of electricity and weak currents. This was of great help to him and his wife in their later discovery of radium. Piezoelectric crystals are even more widely used today in radio and ultrasonic waves.

Regarding the magnetism of various substances at different temperatures, Curie discovered Curie's Law. From the study of the physical phenomena of crystals, Curie also elucidated the symmetrical relationship between cause and effect in natural laws, known as Curie's Symmetry Principle. This principle has become one of the fundamental principles of modern science.

A few months after the Curies married in 1895, Professor Becquerel of the Paris Museum of Natural History discovered that uranium and its compounds emitted a ray naturally and continuously. Like X-rays, it could make air conductive and expose photographic plates through black paper, leaving traces. This was an extremely novel and important fact that immediately caught the attention of the young couple. They asked themselves whether there were any other substances in the universe besides uranium and its compounds that possessed this radioactive property.

Madame Curie examined many elements, compounds, and minerals and found that thorium and thorium compounds were also radioactive, and that two uranium-containing minerals, pitchblende and chalcolite, were even more radioactive than pure uranium. This was a "strange" thing. "Perhaps there's a mistake!" Madame Curie carefully checked her experiments, doing them again and again. The results were always the same, leading her to believe that these two minerals must contain a new element, an element never before known to mankind. The radioactivity of this new element was much stronger than that of uranium or thorium.

Her research results were so important that Curie had to put aside his research on crystalline bodies to join her in searching for this new element never before known to mankind. They worked tirelessly, day and night, trying to extract this rare element from pitchblende using chemical analysis. They removed the non-radioactive parts of the mineral, leaving the radioactive parts behind, doing this again and again. As a result, one or two hundred pounds of raw material was reduced to only two or three ounces of material. But the radioactivity of this material was four hundred times stronger than that of pure uranium. On July 18, 1898, they reported the discovery of the new element at the French Academy of Sciences, and said very modestly: "If the existence of this new element can be confirmed in the future, we would like to call it polonium, in memory of the homeland of one of us, Poland."

Polonium is enriched by adhering to bismuth. The Curies used barium as a protective agent and further enriched it, obtaining a small amount of material. Its radioactivity was nine hundred times stronger than that of pure uranium. On the day after Christmas of that year, the Curies announced the discovery of a second new element at the French Academy of Sciences, which was radium.

In a few months, the Curies discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, a truly amazing feat. However, the polonium and radium they obtained at this time were not directly tangible and could not be taken out for people to see, like gold and silver, to distinguish their color as yellow or white. Therefore, the Curies further engaged in refining. After nine years, in the year after Curie's death, they extracted about half a gram of pure radium chloride from dozens of tons of minerals. Madame Curie used it to determine the atomic weight of radium as 226. It took another three years, until 1910, for the successful acquisition of pure radium.

The Curies' workplace at that time was a dilapidated shed. It was not only far from the appearance of a modern laboratory, but also far from adequate even for France at that time. Curie was an ordinary professor at the Paris School of Physics and Chemistry, without research funding or space. His wife was even less fortunate, merely Curie's assistant without any salary or official position. However, material difficulties could not dampen their spirits. They wanted to do research, regardless of the cold, heat, or rain, so they used the long-abandoned dilapidated shed opposite the factory as their laboratory. Inside the shed, there were only two old tables, a broken stove, and a blackboard that Curie liked to use. There was nothing else, not even a cabinet to store things. The materials they repeatedly refined had nowhere to be placed, so they had to be placed on the table. Whenever they entered the shed at night to work without turning on the lights, and saw these repeatedly refined materials emitting phosphorescence, they comforted and encouraged each other. In fact, their glory, like these phosphorescent lights, continued to grow with their work day by day. Madame Curie often said that these years were the happiest time of her life, and that the dilapidated shed was the sweetest place in her memories.

Two years before Curie's death, the French government awarded him a medal to commend his achievements. But Curie said: "What I need is a laboratory, not a medal." Unfortunately, Curie never got a decent workplace in his lifetime. After Curie's death, Madame Curie appealed everywhere, hoping to build a radium institute. She said: "The discovery of radium was indeed completed under poor conditions, but this is by no means a condition or reason for success, but only made us exhausted. For the progress of science and for the happiness of mankind, in addition to the wisdom of flesh and blood and the sincerity of will, there must be considerable equipment."

At the end of the nineteenth century, scientists were still convinced that our universe was composed of completely defined objects, and consisted of dozens of immutable atoms. Through the work of the Curies and others, people now know that every second a small amount of radium releases many helium atoms from its interior and shoots them outward with great force. Madame Curie called this "a great revolution in the interior of the atom." The remnant after the explosion is a gaseous radon atom. This atom itself becomes another radioactive substance, and this substance changes again, so that the changes gradually form a family. Radium is a descendant of uranium, and polonium is a descendant of radium. Therefore, the discovery of uranium finally broke the claim that the atom is the final and indivisible unit of matter, proving that the atom can be completely transformed from one substance to another. This more clearly reveals the unity of the material world.

Did the Curies foresee the atomic energy we know so well today? Curie discovered that radium and radium salts continuously generate heat, which is three to five degrees Celsius higher than the surrounding temperature; and he correctly determined that the source of this heat energy is due to changes inside the atom. Madame Curie experimentally measured that one gram of radium generates 135 calories of heat in one hour, and the radium itself hardly decreases, because one gram of radium still has half a gram left after 1580 years. The generation of this heat is slow, but continuous. The total heat released when one gram of radium is completely transformed is 400,000 times greater than the heat generated by burning one gram of coal. It can be seen that the energy stored inside the atom is enormous. If it can be taken and used, it is naturally very important. Therefore, since Curie, from the beginning of the twentieth century, people have foreseen the coming of the atomic energy age.

Another miracle of radium is that its rays can be used to treat tumors. This aroused great interest in the manufacture of pure radium by industrialists and businessmen in various countries, especially in the United States. A factory in Buffalo, USA, wrote to the Curies asking them to tell them the method of extracting radium. Since radium was discovered by the Curies and first separated by them, they could have obtained patent rights from various countries and charged royalties from manufacturers using the extraction method. Doing so would have helped their difficult lives at the time. But the Curies believed that since radium could cure diseases, they should not profit from it. They immediately answered the American factory with a detailed explanation of the entire method of extracting radium, without asking for any remuneration.

The great humanitarian spirit of the Curies is a great irony to the current aggressive policy of the United States in using atomic energy to create disasters for mankind. In fact, in Curie's eyes, he had long seen this possibility of such scum in mankind. In 1905, when he gave a speech at the Swedish Academy of Sciences in the name of Nobel Prize winner, he said:

"The discovery of radium has changed some basic principles in physics, sparked bold hypotheses about the source of energy in radioactive phenomena in chemistry, explained previously incomprehensible truths in geology and meteorology, and affirmed the therapeutic effect of radium on tumor cells in biology. All of this is for the happiness of mankind. But can radium bring disaster to mankind?

We can imagine that in the hands of criminals, radium can become an extremely dangerous thing. We should be able to ask ourselves: Is it good for mankind to know the secrets of nature? Is mankind mature enough to be able to use the secrets of nature, or will it be troubled by these understandings instead? Nobel's invention of dynamite is a typical example. It can help people do admirable work, but in the hands of great criminals who want to drag people into war, it is also a terrible tool of destruction.

I stand among those who believe that mankind can draw happiness from new inventions, rather than disaster."

This is the purpose of the Curies' lifelong hard work, and also the source of their great creative ability.

The life of the Curies was an arduous, intense, and fruitful labor, and the best example of scientific research life. They dedicated their entire lives to science and made great contributions. Scientific workers in New China have an incomparably superior social system and working conditions. They should take the Curies as a model, encourage themselves even more, give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and contribute all their strength to serve socialist construction.

The Curies sincerely hoped that their labor achievements and all scientific discoveries would be used in progressive and peaceful undertakings to benefit the people. We commemorate the Curies to work tirelessly to realize this wish.

    镭的父母——居里夫妇
    纪念比埃尔·居里逝世五十周年
    严济慈
    法国物理学家比埃尔·居里，在五十年前的今天，在他为人类作出了巨大的和正可以作出更大的贡献的时候，被一辆马车撞死了。这是科学界莫大的损失！
    居里夫妇互相认识之前，比埃尔·居里已是一位声誉卓著的大科学家了。在1880年，他还只有二十一岁，就和他的哥哥雅克·居里一同发现了水晶压电现象，并且从而创造了压电水晶秤，可以用砝码来测定渺小的电量和微弱的电流。这对于以后他和他的夫人发现镭的工作有极大的帮助。压电水晶在今天更广泛地应用在无线电和超声波中。
    关于各种物质在不同温度下的磁性，居里发现了居里定律。从晶体的物理现象的研究中，居里又阐明了自然规律中因和果的对称关系，即世所称居里对称原则。这种原则成为现代科学的基本原则之一。
    居里夫妇1895年结婚后几个月，巴黎天然博物院贝克莱尔教授发现铀和它的化合物天然不息地放出一种射线，和X光一样，可以使空气导电，可以透过黑纸使照相片感光，留有痕迹。这是一件极其新奇而重要的事实，立刻引起这对青年夫妇的注意。他们乃自发问，宇宙之内，除铀和它的化合物外，有无其它物质也具有这种放射特性。
    居里夫人检查了许多元素、化合物和矿物，结果发现钍和钍的化合物也具有放射性，并且有两种含铀的矿物，一为沥青铀矿，一为辉铜矿，比纯粹的铀，放射性更为强烈。这是一件“奇怪”的事。“也许弄错了吧！”居里夫人很小心地检查自己的试验，做了一次，又做一次，结果总是一样，使她不能不相信这两种矿物之中一定含有新的元素，人们从来不曾知道的元素。这种新元素的放射性比铀或钍要强得多。
    她的研究结果太关重要了，使得居里不能不放下有关结晶体的研究来和她一起搜寻这人类从来不曾知道的新元素。他们废寝忘食，昼夜不辍，意图从沥青铀矿中用化学分析法提炼这稀罕的元素。把矿物中无放射性的部分去掉，把有放射性的部分留着，这样一次又一次地做去，结果一、二百斤的原料只剩下二、三两的东西。但是这点东西的放射性却比纯粹的铀要强四百倍。他们于1898年7月18日便在法国科学院，报告新元素的发现，并且十分谦虚地说：“假使这新元素的存在将来能够证实的话，我们想叫它钋，来纪念我俩中一人的祖国波兰。”
    钋是附丽于铋而富集起来的。居里夫妇另用钡为护身，再事富集，又得少许东西。它的放射性要比纯粹的铀强到九百倍之多。这一年圣诞节后一天，居里夫妇又在法国科学院宣布第二个新元素的发现，这就是镭。
    在几个月的时间里，居里夫妇发现了二个新元素钋和镭，真是伟业惊人。不过他们这个时候得到的钋和镭还是不可直接捉摸的，不能像金、银一样拿出来给人看，辨别它的颜色之为黄或白。因此居里夫妇再进一步从事提炼，经过九年，到了居里死后的次年，才从几十吨的矿物中提得半克左右的纯粹氯化镭，居里夫人用来测定镭的原子量为226。再花三年功夫，到1910年，纯粹镭的获得，才告成功。
    居里夫妇当年工作的所在是一个破烂的棚子。现代实验室的模样固然谈不到，就在当年法国来说，也是远不够格的。居里在巴黎理化专门学校是普通教授，没有研究的经费和地方，他的夫人更不消说，只是一个既无工资又无名义的居里助手。不过物质上的困难决不能稍挫他们的志气。他们要研究，不管风寒暑热，就用那工厂对面久已荒废的破棚，来做他们的实验室。棚内只有两张破旧的桌子，一个破火炉和居里喜爱用的一块黑板，此外什么也没有，连藏东西的橱柜也没有一个。他们屡次提炼出来的东西，无处放置，只好摆在桌上。每当他们夜间入棚工作而未开灯之先，看见这些一次又一次提炼出来的东西在那儿发磷光的时候，便彼此互相安慰鼓励。其实他们的光荣，也正像这些磷光一样，随着他们工作一天一天的进行而继续不断地增长。居里夫人常说，这些年头是她毕生最快乐的时节，那破陋小棚更是她回忆中最甜蜜的所在。
    在居里死前二年，法国政府给他勋章，以表扬他的功绩。但居里说：“我所需要的是实验室，不是勋章。”可惜居里一生竟未得到一个像样的工作地方。居里死后，居里夫人到处呼吁，希望能建造一所镭学研究所。她说：“镭的发现固然是在穷困的情况下完成的，但这决不是成功的条件或理由，只不过弄得我们精疲力竭而已。为科学求进步，为人类谋幸福，血肉的聪明与意志的虔诚外，还得有相当的设备。”
    在十九世纪末叶，科学家们还确信我们这个宇宙是由完全确定的物体组成的，是由永远不变的几十种原子组成的。通过居里夫妇以及别人的工作，人们现在知道每一秒钟少许的镭就由它的内部放出许多氦原子，并且用极大的力量把它们射到外面去。居里夫人称这为“原子内部爆发的大革命”。爆发后的残余是一种气体的氡原子。这种原子本身又变成另外一种有放射性的物质，而这种物质又再起变化，这样次第蜕变自成一个宗族。镭是铀的子孙，钋又是镭的子孙。所以铀的发现终于打破了原子是物质最后的、不可分割的单位的说法，证明原子是完全可以从这一种物质蜕变为另一种物质的。这就更清楚地揭示了物质世界的统一性。
    居里夫妇是否预见到我们今天所熟知的原子能呢？居里发现镭与镭盐不断发生热量，较其四周的温度可高摄氏三至五度；并且完全正确地断定这种热能的来源是由于原子内部的变化。居里夫人实验测知一克的镭，在一小时内，发生135卡的热，而镭的本身可说毫无减少，因为一克的镭过了1580年之后还剩半克。这种热量的发生，进行虽缓，但是继续不断，到一克的镭蜕变完尽的时候所放出的总热量，比之燃烧一克的煤所生的热量要大四十万倍。可见原子内部所蕴藏的能量之巨大。如果能知所取用，自然非常重要，因此自居里以后，从二十世纪开始，就预知原子能时代之将到来。
    镭的另一种奇迹是可以利用它的射线治疗肿瘤。这就引起各国特别是美国工商业家制造纯镭的极大兴趣。美国白弗罗市的一个工厂来信要求居里夫妇告诉他们提取镭的方法。镭既由居里夫妇发现，也首次由他们分离出来，本来可以由他们向各国取得专利权，从而向应用提取方法的厂家收取税金。这样做，对于他们当时困难的生活是会有帮助的。但是居里夫妇认为镭既可以治病，决不能从中取利，他们立刻把提取镭的全部方法详尽地回答了美国工厂，没有要求任何报酬。
    居里夫妇这种伟大的人道主义精神，对美国现在利用原子能为人类制造灾祸的侵略政策，讽刺实在太大了。其实在居里的眼中，老早已看出了人类中的败类的这种可能性。他在1905年以诺贝尔奖金获得者的名义在瑞典科学院演讲的时候说道：
    “镭的发现，在物理学上改变了若干基本原理，在化学上掀起了放射性现象中能量来源的大胆假设，在地质学和气象学上说明了向来讲不通的道理，在生物学上镭对肿瘤细胞的治疗作用被肯定了，一切都是为了人类的幸福。但是镭能不能为祸于人类呢？
    我们可以想到，在罪犯们的手中，镭是可以成为极危险的东西。我们应该可以问问自己：人类认识自然的秘密到底有没有好处？人类是否已经成熟到能够利用自然秘密的程度，还是反而被这些认识所烦恼？诺贝尔发明的炸药就是一个典型的例子。它可以帮助人们做出令人羡慕的工作，但在要把人民拖向战争的大罪犯手中，它同时又是极可怕的破坏工具。
    我是站在认为人类能从新发明中吸取幸福，而不是吸取祸害的那些人中间的。”
    这就是居里夫妇一生辛勤工作的目的，也是他们巨大创造能力的源泉。
    居里夫妇的一生是一场艰苦的、紧张的、富有成果的劳动，是科学研究生活的最好榜样。他们把生命的全部献给了科学，并且作出了伟大的贡献。新中国的科学工作者，有无比优越的社会制度和工作条件，应当以居里夫妇为模范，益加自勉自励，充分发挥积极性和创造性，贡献一切力量，为社会主义建设服务。
    居里夫妇恳切希望他们的劳动成果以及所有的科学发现被用在进步和和平事业，为人民谋福利。我们纪念居里夫妇，要为实现这个愿望而不倦地努力。
