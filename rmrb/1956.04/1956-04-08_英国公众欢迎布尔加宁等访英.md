Xinhua News Agency, London, April 6th via TASS: The British public attaches great importance to the upcoming visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain. The letters received by the Soviet Embassy and the editorial departments of various newspapers in London and other localities from a wide range of people eloquently demonstrate this.

    A group of Scottish university students, in a letter to the Soviet Embassy, requested that their invitation to visit the University of Edinburgh and the Student Union be conveyed to Bulganin and Khrushchev. Students at Oxford University have also extended a similar invitation.

    The Shop Stewards Committee of the Dartford computer factory expressed in a letter their warm welcome to the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev, and expressed their belief that their talks with representatives of the British government "will help accelerate the achievement of agreements on disarmament, cessation of nuclear and atomic weapons testing, and expansion of Anglo-Soviet trade."

    Many other trade unions and social organizations have also expressed the same wishes in their letters.

    英国公众欢迎布尔加宁等访英
    新华社据塔斯社伦敦6日讯　英国公众重视布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫行将访问英国。苏联大使馆以及伦敦和地方各报社编辑部所接到的广泛阶层人士的信件就雄辩地说明了这一点。
    苏格兰一批大学生在致苏联大使馆的信中请求向布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫转达请他们访问爱丁堡大学和学生会的邀请。牛津大学学生也提出了同样的邀请。
    达特福德计算机工厂车间工长委员会在信中表示热烈欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的访问，并且表示相信，他们同英国政府代表的会谈“将有助于加速达成关于裁军、停止试验核子和原子武器以及扩大英苏贸易的协议。”
    其他许多工会和社会团体的信中也表示了同样的愿望。
