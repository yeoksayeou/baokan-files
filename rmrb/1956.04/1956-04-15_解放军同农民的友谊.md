The Friendship Between the People's Liberation Army and the Peasants

　　Military-Civilian Friendship Reservoir
　　Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing actively participated in voluntary labor to help the United, Xuanwu, and Happiness Agricultural Production Cooperatives in the northern foothills of Zijin Mountain in the suburbs of Nanjing build a reservoir, freeing 3,000 mu of surrounding farmland from the threat of floods. A water release ceremony was held on April 11. When the mountain water slowly flowed out through the gate, the cooperative members and soldiers cheered and jumped excitedly at the gate. Afterwards, more than 4,000 soldiers and civilians held a grand get-together.
　　From the very beginning of the reservoir's construction, generals, officers, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing devoted themselves to holiday voluntary labor. Up to April 11, the troops participated in about 12,000 person-times of voluntary labor, completing about 10,000 cubic meters of earthwork, accounting for about 25% of the entire project, enabling the project, originally scheduled to be completed by the end of April, to be completed ahead of schedule. On the outside of the reservoir's dam, members of the agricultural cooperative used cement and gravel to build the six large characters "Military-Civilian Friendship Reservoir." Older cooperative members said: we must educate our children and grandchildren to not forget those who built the reservoir when they use the water, and to always remember the People's Liberation Army.

　　Enthusiastic Donations to Build a Tractor Station
　　The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lüda responded to the call of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to raise funds to build tractor stations, and have already donated more than 700,000 yuan, equivalent to the total funds for establishing a small tractor station capable of cultivating 50,000 mu of land. This is another new gift from the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lüda to the agricultural cooperation movement following the donation of 668 double-wheeled double-shared plows during the Spring Festival's support-government and cherish-people movement.
　　As in the past, all officers and soldiers responded to this donation with great enthusiasm. One unit completed its donation plan with more than 50% excess within just one hour. Zhang Zhuxin, a lieutenant from a certain unit, donated all 72 yuan he had prepared to buy a bicycle.

　　Voluntary Labor to Help Farmers Produce
　　Many officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin used their holidays to participate in voluntary labor in agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs. On the 8th, the Tianjin General Team of the Public Security Forces organized more than 100 officers and soldiers to help the Heping Road Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hexi District with spring plowing, completing the work of spreading manure on 200 mu of land in five and a half hours. A certain unit stationed in Tanggu used its holidays to dig a drainage ditch five feet wide, two and a half feet deep, and more than 140 zhang long for the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Xinhe Town, Tanggu District. A certain military school and a certain unit stationed in Hedong District have been helping agricultural production cooperatives deliver manure and dig ditches for several consecutive Sundays. According to statistics from a certain unit that helped the Wannianqing and Wannianhong Agricultural Cooperatives in Hexi District with production, from the beginning of March to the beginning of April, they had already done more than 200 workdays (each workday is calculated as eight hours), helping the agricultural cooperatives deliver more than 40,000 jin of manure.

　　Sending Grain to Farmers to Survive the Famine
　　The leading organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Guangzhou have decided to send 60,000 jin of grain saved by the troops last year to farmers in areas of Guangdong Province currently experiencing spring famine. Officers and soldiers of the garrison expressed that they will continue to maintain the fine traditions of hard work and simplicity, and practice strict economy to help farmers produce and survive the famine.

    解放军同农民的友谊
    军民友谊水库
    解放军驻南京部队官兵积极参加义务劳动，帮助南京市郊紫金山北麓的联合、玄武、幸福等农业生产合作社修建了一个水库，使周围三千亩农田解除洪水的威胁。四月十一日举行了放水仪式。当山水通过闸门缓缓流出时，社员们和战士们一起兴奋地在闸门边欢呼、跳跃，随后，军民四千多人举行了盛大的联欢会。
    这个水库一开始兴建，解放军驻南京部队的将军、军官和士兵就投入了假日义务劳动。到四月十一日为止，部队参加义务劳动的约有一万二千人次，完成了约一万土方，占整个工程的25％左右，使得原来预计到四月底完成的工程，提前完工。在水库拦水堤的外侧，农业社的社员们用水泥和碎石筑成了“军民友谊水库”六个大字，老年社员们说：要教育子孙，用水不忘修库人，时刻怀念解放军。
    踊跃捐款筹建拖拉机站
    解放军驻旅大各部队响应中国人民解放军总政治部集资筹建拖拉机站的号召，已经捐款七十多万元，相当于建立一个能耕作五万亩地的小型拖拉机站的全部资金。这是解放军驻旅大部队继春节拥政爱民运动捐献668部双轮双铧犁之后，对农业合作化运动的又一新的献礼。
    这次捐献和以往一样，全体官兵都怀着极大的热情纷纷响应。有个单位只一小时内就超额50％完成了捐献计划。某部中尉张祝新，把准备买脚踏车的72元全部捐献了出来。
    义务劳动帮助农民生产
    中国人民解放军驻天津部队的许多官兵，利用休假日到郊区农业生产合作社参加义务劳动。公安军天津市总队在八日组织了一百多名军官和士兵，帮助河西区和平之路农业生产合作社春耕，五个半小时就完成了二百亩地的撒粪工作。驻塘沽的某部队，利用休假日为塘沽区新河镇第一农业生产合作社挖了宽五尺，深二尺五，长一百四十多丈的排水沟。某军事学校、驻河东区的某部队连续几个星期日帮助农业生产合作社送粪、挖渠。据帮助河西区万年青、万年红农业社生产的某部队统计，从三月份开始，到四月初已经做了二百多个劳动日（每个劳动日以八小时计算），帮助农业社送粪四万多斤。
    送粮给农民度荒
    中国人民解放军驻广州部队领导机关决定把部队去年节省下来的六万斤粮食，送给广东省目前发生春荒地区的农民。驻军官兵表示要继续保持艰苦、朴素的优良传统，厉行节约，来帮助农民生产度荒。
