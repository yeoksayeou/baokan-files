Textile Industry Workers Strive to Improve Product Quality

As of April 4th, 218 textile factories across the country had participated in inter-factory competitions.

Workers in many factories have focused on improving product quality during the competition. Among the eighteen state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai, sixteen factories had all of their cotton yarn reach the new quality standards by March 15th; the number of workers producing zero-defect cloth increased from 748 in January to 1,103 in February. In Changshu City’s Xin Yu Weaving Factory, 224 out of 302 weaving workers have not produced a single piece of substandard cloth this year.

New products are constantly being added during the competition. Recently, factories under the Tianjin Textile Bureau have successfully trial-produced more than ten new products. The leno and "Youth Luo" trial-produced by the state-owned Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, and the herringbone twill and chevron twill trial-produced by the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, are now in formal production. Fabric pattern designers in Shanghai and other places have designed a large number of new fabric patterns such as "A Riot of Flowers" and "Springtime Garden," and fabrics with these new patterns have begun to be produced successively.

In the competition, many examples of mutual assistance and common improvement have emerged. Gu Ruifu, a veteran technician from Shanghai Rongxin Underwear Factory, disclosed the method of manufacturing shirt collars and helped Xinguang Underwear Factory improve its operating methods, so that the quality of shirts produced by this factory met export requirements. Yang Yinhong, a labor model from the state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory, helped Ye Huamei in her group improve her skills, and they were recently jointly elected as Shanghai labor models.

    纺织工业职工努力提高产品质量
    到四月四日止，全国已有218个纺织工厂的职工参加了厂际竞赛。
    许多厂的职工在竞赛中注意提高了产品质量。上海十八个国营棉纺织厂，到三月十五日就有十六个厂的全部棉纱达到了新的质量标准；不出次布的工人在一月份是748人，二月份增加到1，103人。常熟市新虞织布厂302个织布工人，有224个人今年没有出过一匹次布。
    竞赛中，新产品不断增加。最近天津纺织管理局所属各厂试制成功的新产品有十多种。国营天津第六棉纺织厂试制的格纱和青年罗，国营天津第三棉纺织厂试制的小人字呢和山形斜纹，现在都已经正式生产。上海等地的花布图样设计师们设计了“百花怒放”、“春色满园”等大批新的花布图案，有这些新图案的花布已经陆续开始生产。
    竞赛中，出现了许多互相帮助，共同提高的事例。上海荣新内衣厂老技工谷瑞孚公开了制造衬衣胶领的方法，并且帮助新光内衣厂改进操作方法，使这个厂生产的衬衣质量达到了出口的要求。国营上海第五棉纺织厂劳动模范杨银红，帮助本组叶华妹提高技术，她们最近一起当选为上海市劳动模范。
