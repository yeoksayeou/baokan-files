Establish Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Institutions Universally

This year, Hunan Province will establish more than 110 schistosomiasis prevention and control teams and stations in the Changde and Xiangtan Special Districts bordering Dongting Lake, where schistosomiasis is prevalent. Hunan Province will also establish a central hospital for the treatment of schistosomiasis.

Currently, Hunan Province is training prevention and control personnel. The more than 800 intermediate medical personnel for schistosomiasis prevention and control trained in Changde and Xiangtan Special Districts have already begun their studies on the 14th and 15th respectively.

Prior to this, Hunan Province had already trained 182 medical personnel for schistosomiasis prevention and control. Most of them are attending physicians and assistant physicians from hospitals in Changsha, Hengyang, Xiangtan, Changde, and other places. In addition, more than 140 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners participating in schistosomiasis prevention and control work are also concentrated in Changsha City for study.

Youth Shock Brigade for Schistosomiasis Prevention

The first youth shock brigade for schistosomiasis prevention in Zhejiang Province departed from Hangzhou on the 15th to rural areas of Haining County, Jiaxing District, where there are more schistosomiasis patients.

This youth shock brigade was formed by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Health based on the proposal of Wu Yunlong, Ji Shiyi, and other eight graduating students from the Hangzhou Health School's medical class. The team consists of twelve physicians and medical assistants, and eighteen inspection, nursing, and pharmacy personnel, of whom twenty-one are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. The captain is Gao Degui, a national youth activist in socialist construction.

Shaanxi Begins to Eliminate Endemic Diseases

In the past month or so, Shaanxi Province has successively established five endemic disease prevention and control institutes. These institutes will divide the work to eliminate kala-azar (leishmaniasis) and yellow water disease in the province within two years, and effectively control the occurrence of goiter and Keshan disease within twelve years.

The personnel of these prevention and control institutes are preparing to organize thirteen mobile medical teams to go deep into the kala-azar epidemic areas of Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, in late April to carry out prevention and control work, and first eliminate kala-azar in the Guanzhong area this year. In June, two more venereal disease prevention and control teams will be organized to focus on prevention and control in Danfeng, Jingbian, and other counties.

    今年，湖南省将在血吸虫病流行的洞庭湖滨常德、湘潭两专区新建立一百一十多个血吸虫病防治组、站。湖南省还要建立一所治血吸虫病的中心医院。
    现在，湖南省正在训练防治工作人员。常德和湘潭两专区训练的八百多名防治血吸虫病的中级医务人员，已经分别在十四和十五两日开始学习。
    在这以前，湖南省已经训练了182名防治血吸虫病的医务人员。其中大部分是长沙、衡阳、湘潭、常德等地医院中的主治医师和助理医师。此外，还有一百四十多名参加防治血吸虫病工作的中医师也正集中在长沙市进行学习。

    这些防治所的人员正在准备组织十三个巡回医疗队在四月下旬分别深入陕西省关中黑热病流行地区进行防治工作，在今年首先消灭关中地区的黑热病。六月份再组织两个性病防治队，到丹凤、靖边等县重点进行防治。
