    Establishing County Newspapers Systematically
    Many counties across the country are actively establishing newspapers primarily targeting farmers. According to incomplete statistics, nearly fifty counties in Jiangsu, Yunnan, Liaoning, and other provinces had established newspapers before March of this year.
    In the development of county newspapers, all regions have paid attention to the issue of equipping and training county newspaper cadres. Shanxi, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces have adopted methods such as transferring cadres to Party schools for study, or running short-term training classes for news cadres, holding newspaper professional meetings, and sending county newspaper cadres to provincial and municipal newspapers for short-term internships to train cadres.

    有步骤地创立县报
    全国许多县正积极创办以农民为主要对象的报纸。根据不完全的统计：江苏、云南、辽宁等三省在今年三月份以前，已有将近五十个县创办了报纸。
    在发展县报的工作中，各地都注意了配备、训练县报干部的问题。山西、辽宁、陕西、江苏、浙江等省分别采取抽调干部到党校学习或开办新闻干部短期训练班、开报纸专业会议、派县报干部到省、市报纸短期实习方法训练干部。　（王承放）
