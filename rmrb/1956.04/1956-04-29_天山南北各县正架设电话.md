Telephone lines are being erected in counties both north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. The Xinjiang Postal and Telecommunications Administration has dispatched eleven survey teams to conduct line surveys in places such as Yining, Shule, Kuerle, Artux, and Bortala. More than 1,000 kilometers of lines have already been surveyed. Poles needed for setting up telephone lines in Wusu, Shufu, and Burqin, and other places, have been completely cut down and are currently being baked and brushed in preparation for wiring. Soon, cities and villages in these counties will have telephone service.

    天山南北各县正架设电话
    天山南北各县正在架设电话。新疆邮电管理局派出了十一个勘测组，在伊宁、疏勒、库尔勒、阿图什、博尔塔拉等地进行线路勘测工作。现在已经勘测完成的线路有一千多公里。乌苏、疏附、布尔津等地架设电线所需要的电杆已经砍伐齐全，现在正在烤刷电杆，即将开始架线。不久以后，这些县的城市和乡村就可以通电话了。　　　　（新疆日报编辑部）
