Henan Wheat Harvest Looks Promising

    The more than 75 million mu of wheat seedlings in Henan Province this year are generally growing better than in previous years. Except for a small portion of wheat fields in the Shangqiu, Xinyang, and other regions, where the wheat seedlings are growing poorly due to late planting, the other wheat fields are in good condition. As long as attention is paid to the later-stage management of the wheat fields, a bumper harvest of wheat can be guaranteed for the province this year.

    Currently, the members of the vast agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province, seeing the prospect of a bumper wheat harvest, are paying more attention to the management of wheat fields. The Canlan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tangyin County, immediately after the intense cotton sowing work was completed, promptly organized 600 women and semi-able-bodied laborers to weed and hoe the wheat fields. They also organized 240 people to accumulate 23,200 jin of fertilizer within fifteen days, ensuring that the wheat has sufficient fertilizer. The female members of the Liuzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mengjin County, fearing that the wheat would be affected by frost, actively dug frost-prevention holes in the fields. They dug 584 frost-prevention holes in three days and prepared 5,560 jin of frost-prevention firewood and grass so that they could create smoke in the prepared frost-prevention holes to prevent frost whenever the climate changes.

    Various localities are now actively digging soil to inspect the growth changes of the wheat midge; they have also signed aircraft control contracts with the Civil Aviation Administration to prepare for planned control of wheat midge. (Wang Pinlong)

    河南小麦丰收有望
    河南全省的七千五百多万亩麦苗，今年一般都比往年生长良好。除商丘、信阳等专区有少部分麦田，因播种较晚，麦苗生长较差外，其他麦田都很好，只要注意麦田的后期管理，今年全省的小麦可保证丰收。
    目前，全省广大农业生产合作社的社员们，看到小麦丰收有望，对小麦田间管理更加关心了。汤阴县灿烂农业生产合作社，紧张的棉花播种工作刚结束，就及时组织六百个妇女和半劳动力锄麦、拔草，并且组织二百四十个人，在十五天内，积肥二万三千二百斤，保证了小麦有足够肥料。孟津县刘庄农业生产合作社的女社员们，怕小麦受霜，积极在地里打防霜洞。她们在三天内打了防霜洞584个，并且准备防霜柴草五千五百六十斤，以便气候一有变化，就在打好的防霜洞内熏烟防霜。
    各地现正积极挖土检查小麦吸浆虫的生长变化；还同中央民航局签订了飞机防治合同，准备有计划地防治小麦吸浆虫。（王品隆）
