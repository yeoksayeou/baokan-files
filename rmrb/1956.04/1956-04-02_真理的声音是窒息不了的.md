The U.S. government's persecution of the American progressive newspaper the New York "Daily Worker" this time exposes the fear and hatred of the American reactionaries for the ideas of peace, democracy, and progress propagated by the American Communist Party.

The "Daily Worker" is edited by the American Communist Party. Since its founding in 1924, it has consistently undertaken its glorious task, spreading ideas of peace, democracy, and human progress. It is the brave voice of truth of the American people, and it has consistently fought to safeguard the interests of the American people. During the economic panic years from 1929 to 1933, it called on the American people to rise up and fight against hunger. Before and during World War II, it constantly exposed the activities of fascism and called on and encouraged the American people to fight against Hitler's Germany and Japanese imperialism. After the war, it repeatedly exposed the American reactionaries' conspiracy to revive West German and Japanese militarism and push the world into another slaughter. After the outbreak of the Korean War, it exposed the American reactionaries' criminal conspiracy to carry out the war of aggression against Korea almost every day. In the years of escalating "Cold War," it was constantly calling on the American people to unite against the American fascist offensive, against war preparations, while working to strengthen the unity of international peace forces, in order to encourage the American people's confidence in the struggle for peace. It has also always been a loyal friend of the Chinese people, with deep sympathy and fraternal support for the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has been working to establish friendly relations between China and the United States, condemning the American armed occupation of Taiwan and military threats against China.

The existence of the "Daily Worker" and its consistent struggle for peace, democracy, and human progress has deeply disturbed the American reactionaries. For many years, the American reactionaries have tried every means to stifle its voice. The "Daily Worker" works in the most difficult circumstances. Its staff and readers are often attacked. It has been under economic pressure for a long time. It is constantly in danger of being suspended. News agencies close to the U.S. government also admitted that in the past thirty years, the "Daily Worker" has suffered "attacks of bricks, bombs, arson, libel charges...". However, no matter how the American reactionaries persecute it, the "Daily Worker" still holds high the banner of truth and insists on continuing to publish.

This time, the American reactionaries launched a surprise attack, sending people to search and seal up the offices of the "Daily Worker" and confiscating its property, attempting to force the "Daily Worker" to stop publishing in one fell swoop. However, fascist persecution cannot intimidate the warriors fighting for truth.

The next day's "Daily Worker" appeared with a new fighting posture. It published a telegram from the General Secretary of the American Communist Party, Dennis, to Eisenhower protesting this fascist persecution, and published an editorial entitled "A Dark Day for a Free Press," exposing the conspiracy to persecute the "Daily Worker." It said: "It was sealed after refusing to report to the U.S. government the names of the people who gave it financial support"; everyone knows that the "Daily Worker" has persevered relying on the unwavering support of outstanding American sons and daughters. The American reactionaries' conspiracy is not difficult to see through. It wants to force the "Daily Worker" to hand over the list so as to facilitate political persecution of these people and cut off the "Daily Worker's" source of funding, thereby stifling this democratic voice of the American people, in order to launch a further blow against American democratic forces.

However, the American reactionaries' fabrication of such untenable excuses to conceal their fascist persecution of the American Communist Party and the "Daily Worker" precisely illustrates the extent to which the American reactionaries have become bankrupt politically and morally. It fears that people will tell the American people the truth.

The ideas of peace, democracy, and progress advocated by the American Communist Party have become the common ideas of millions of American people, and it is no longer something that can be suppressed by any means. It is precisely because of this that people are convinced that the American democratic forces will surely take action and repulse the fascist offensive of the reactionaries with increasing momentum, and the "Daily Worker" will surely break through any obstacles and continue to voice the truth.

    真理的声音是窒息不了的
    钦本立
    美国政府这次对美国进步报纸纽约“工人日报”的迫害，暴露了美国反动派对美国共产党所传播的和平、民主、进步思想的恐惧和仇恨。
    “工人日报”是美国共产党主编的。自它在1924年创刊以来的三十多年中，始终如一地担当着它光荣的任务，传播和平、民主和人类进步的思想。它是美国人民勇敢的真理的声音，它一贯地为维护美国人民的利益而斗争。在1929年到1933年的经济恐慌年代里，它号召美国人民起来进行反饥饿的斗争。在第二次大战以前及战争的年代中，它不断地揭露了法西斯的活动，并号召和鼓舞美国人民同希特勒德国和日本帝国主义进行斗争。在战后，它反复揭露美国反动派复活西德和日本军国主义并将世界推入另一次屠杀中的阴谋。朝鲜战争爆发后，它几乎每天都在揭露美国反动派进行侵略朝鲜战争的罪恶阴谋。在“冷战”加剧的年代里，它无时无刻不在号召美国人民团结起来反对美国法西斯的进攻，反对战争准备，同时致力于加强国际和平力量的团结，以鼓舞美国人民争取和平斗争的信心。它也始终是中国人民的忠实的友人，对中国人民的革命斗争一直怀着深厚的同情，并且给予兄弟般的支持。自从中华人民共和国立国以来，它一直为争取建立中美友好关系而努力，谴责美国武装侵占台湾和对中国进行武力的威胁。
      “工人日报”的存在和它一贯坚持为和平、民主和人类进步而进行的斗争，使美国反动派深为不安。多少年来，美国反动派想尽了各种办法，企图窒息它的声音。“工人日报”在最困难的环境中进行工作，它的工作人员和读者经常受到袭击，它长时期处于经济压力之下，它随时有遭受到被停刊的危险。接近美国官方的通讯社也承认，在以往三十多年中，“工人日报”遭受了“砖头、炸弹、放火、诽谤罪名……的打击”。然而，不管美国反动派怎样迫害它，“工人日报”仍然高举着真理的旗帜，坚持继续出版。
    这一次，美国反动派发动突袭，派人搜查并查封了“工人日报”的办公室，没收了它的财产。企图一举迫使“工人日报”停止出刊。然而，法西斯的迫害吓不倒为真理而斗争的战士。
    第二天的“工人日报”以新的战斗姿态出现了。它登载了美国共产党总书记丹尼斯给艾森豪威尔关于这次法西斯迫害的抗议电报，并以“自由新闻的黑暗的一天”为题发表了社论，揭露了这次迫害“工人日报”的阴谋，它说：“它是在拒绝向美国政府报告给予它财政支持的人们的名字以后被查封的”；大家知道，“工人日报”是依靠美国优秀儿女对它坚定不移的支持而坚持下来的。美国反动派的阴谋是不难看穿的，它想迫使“工人日报”缴出名单，以便于对这些人进行政治迫害并切断“工人日报”的经费来源，从而窒息美国人民的这一民主呼声，以便对美国民主力量发动进一步的打击。
    但是，美国反动派制造这样站不住脚的借口来掩饰它对美国共产党和“工人日报”的法西斯式迫害，正好说明美国反动派在政治和道义上已经破产到了什么地步。它惧怕人们把事实的真相告诉美国人民。
    美国共产党所倡导的和平、民主、进步的思想已经成为美国千百万人民共同的思想，它已经不是任何方法所能够压制得了的。也正是因为这样，人们确信，美国民主力量一定会行动起来，并以愈来愈强大的声势击退反动派的法西斯进攻，“工人日报”也一定会冲破任何的阻碍，继续发出真理的声音。
