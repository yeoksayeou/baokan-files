Great Achievements of the Soviet Union in Developing Animal Husbandry
Head of the Chinese Animal Husbandry Delegation, Wang Enmao

The entire Chinese Animal Husbandry Delegation visited the great socialist country of the Soviet Union with great excitement from October 18th of last year to January 9th of this year. During this time, we visited many places such as Moscow, Stalingrad, Tashkent, Angijan, Samarkand, Frunze, Issyk-Kul, Alma-Ata, and Taldy-Kurgan. We visited the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition and many collective farms, machine tractor stations, state farms, factories, schools, and scientific research institutions in various places. We participated in dozens of symposiums organized by the Soviet Communist Party and government for us, which satisfied all our requirements for understanding the great achievements and advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in developing agriculture, especially animal husbandry. We had the best learning opportunity.

The main task of the delegation was to understand the great achievements and advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in developing animal husbandry.

The Soviet Union implemented the collectivization of animal husbandry at the same time as agriculture. Because of the collectivization of animal husbandry, animal husbandry has gained broad prospects for development. Now, the development level of Soviet animal husbandry exceeds any historical period. According to Soviet statistics on October 1, 1955, there were 67 million head of cattle, 124.9 million sheep, and 52.1 million pigs. Although Soviet collective farm members still own a considerable number of privately owned livestock in accordance with the Soviet Agricultural Labor Cooperative Model Charter, public livestock occupies the main position in Soviet animal husbandry, except for pigs. In particular, the livestock products sold by collective farms and state farms to the state account for the main position in the state's purchase of livestock products. The development of animal husbandry in Soviet collective farms and state farms is of decisive significance for meeting the people's needs for livestock products and supplying the light industry with livestock product raw materials.

Because the Soviet Union has established and developed a strong socialist industry, it has created conditions for the mechanization and electrification of not only agriculture but also animal husbandry. The Soviet Union's ability to develop collective farm and state farm animal husbandry on a large scale is inseparable from the mechanization and electrification of animal husbandry. The Soviet state supplied animal husbandry production with a large number of various mechanical equipment. The Soviet Union has established animal husbandry machine tractor stations in areas dominated by animal husbandry, supplying collective farm animal husbandry production with various mechanical equipment; in areas dominated by agriculture, agricultural machine tractor stations concurrently manage the supply of various mechanical equipment used in collective farm animal husbandry production. In addition, collective farms themselves own a lot of mechanical equipment for animal husbandry production. We saw in Moscow, Stalingrad, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan that the animal husbandry production of many collective farms and state farms has implemented comprehensive mechanization and electrification. The heavy labor in the animal husbandry production process has been completely or basically replaced by mechanization and electrification. The Soviet Union's animal husbandry has a high level of mechanization and electrification.

The Soviet Union has established a strong and solid feed base for animal husbandry. Soviet animal husbandry workers believe that without a strong and solid feed base, there will be no guarantee for the stable development of animal husbandry. In the Soviet Union, all available land, whether it is barren land, arid grassland, desert, semi-desert area, alpine area, or even alpine area as high as two to four thousand meters above sea level, is fully utilized as pastures and grasslands, and the work of improving pastures and grasslands is actively carried out, so that the original pastures and grasslands with poor grass and low grass production are transformed into pastures and grasslands with good grass and high grass production. We saw in the Soviet Union that the animal husbandry of collective farms and state farms has a solid feed base. Although they all have a certain area of pastures and grasslands, they do not completely rely on natural pastures for grazing, but also plant a large number of feed crops. Animal husbandry is closely integrated with agriculture.

The Soviet Union attaches great importance to livestock breed improvement work in order to accelerate the improvement of the quality and quantity of livestock and livestock products. At present, in addition to improving many livestock breeds, the Soviet Union has also cultivated new varieties of sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs. The quality of new livestock breeds, the quality of products, and the product rate are very high. For example, the average live weight of Askanian new breed rams is 100-110 kg, the highest is 176 kg, the average wool yield is 10-14 kg, the highest is 29.4 kg, the average live weight of ewes is 60-65 kg, the highest is 105 kg, and the average wool yield is 5.5-6 kg. In order to improve livestock breeds and cultivate new breeds, the Soviet Union's animal husbandry scientific research institutions have carried out huge scientific research work and established many breeding experimental farms, national stud farms, state-owned stud farms, and collective farm stud farms. There are 496 national stud farms and state-owned stud farms that improve and cultivate stud cattle, stud sheep, stud horses, and stud pigs alone. A large number of national artificial insemination stations, state-owned farms, and collective farm artificial insemination stations have been established. Now there are nearly 30,000 artificial insemination stations in the Soviet Union, forming a dense artificial insemination network. Almost all cattle, sheep, and horses in the collective farms and state farms we visited in the Soviet Union implemented artificial insemination.

While attaching importance to the improvement of livestock breeds, the Soviet Union emphasized the improvement of feeding management, believing that the improvement of feeding management not only plays a significant role in improving the livestock product rate, but also plays a significant role in affecting livestock to change organisms and heredity. Under the conditions of improving feeding management, the quality and product rate of livestock breeds can be greatly improved, while in the case of poor feeding management, excellent livestock breeds will also rapidly degenerate and deteriorate. We saw many measures taken by the Soviet Union to improve feeding management: such as increasing the construction of modern livestock sheds, implementing a combination of stall feeding and pasture grazing, expanding the planting area of ​​grains, increasing the concentrate feed for livestock, especially emphasizing the planting of corn, increasing the succulent feed for livestock, emphasizing silage feed, implementing green feed rotation grazing, so that livestock can eat more green feed throughout the year, universally implementing feed modulation to improve the nutritional value and taste of feed, implementing automatic drinking water for livestock and adding necessary minerals (salt, etc.), correctly feeding according to the formulated feed standard daily amount, and feeding pregnant livestock, young livestock, and sick livestock separately, and separately formulating daily amount standards. These measures have played a very significant role in improving and improving the quality of livestock breeds and increasing the livestock product rate.

The great development of the Soviet veterinary cause is an important guarantee for the stable development of Soviet animal husbandry. At present, the Soviet Union has eliminated cattle plague, bovine pleuropneumonia, equine glanders, goat pleuropneumonia and other animal epidemics that seriously endanger the development of livestock, and anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, sheep pox, swine erysipelas, and scabies and other animal epidemics have also been basically eliminated. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the prevention of livestock diseases, especially paying attention to understanding the research, testing, and elimination of the vector of livestock infectious diseases - various infectious viruses and microorganisms. At stations and wharfs for transporting livestock and livestock products, strict sanitary inspection work is carried out when purchasing, processing, and selling livestock products, and they are always vigilant about the occurrence of livestock infectious diseases. When a livestock infectious disease occurs in a certain place, it is promptly and rapidly eliminated. The epidemic area is blocked, livestock are prohibited from coming and going to other areas, and livestock in other areas are vaccinated. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent livestock infectious diseases. In order to prevent livestock infectious diseases, the Soviet Union has manufactured fifty-six kinds of biological drugs, creating good conditions for preventing animal epidemics. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the establishment and strengthening of veterinary scientific research institutions, veterinary work institutions, and veterinary schools. The entire Soviet Union has four central veterinary scientific research institutes, and each republic and province has veterinary scientific research institutes and veterinary experimental stations, districts have veterinary and bacterial experimental institutes, and mobile veterinary experimental institutes are located in driving grazing centers. The Soviet Union has universally established and developed a veterinary network. Now there are a total of 4,206 district veterinary treatment centers, 10,570 veterinary work sections (serving five to seven collective farms), 14,800 veterinary work stations (serving one to two collective farms), 630 urban veterinary treatment centers, and twenty-seven veterinary treatment stations. In addition, state farms and large collective farms also have their own veterinary institutions. The national veterinary organs have a total of 19,700 veterinarians and 3,600 deputy veterinarians. Collective farms have a total of 1,760 veterinarians and 39,000 veterinary assistants. The entire Soviet Union currently has thirty-seven veterinary colleges and veterinary departments that train veterinarians, and 135 secondary veterinary schools that train veterinary assistants and veterinary hygienists. Each year, two thousand five hundred to three thousand students graduate from veterinary universities and are assigned to machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms to serve as veterinarians.

The scientific research work of Soviet animal husbandry has played an extremely important role in the development of animal husbandry. In Moscow, there is the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and some republics have its branches. For example, the Kazakh Republic we visited has the Kazakh Branch of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, under which there are the Animal Husbandry Scientific Research Institute, the Pasture and Feed Scientific Research Institute, the Veterinary Scientific Research Institute, etc. The Uzbek Republic and the Kyrgyz Republic we visited all have animal husbandry scientific research institutes and other scientific research institutions. The Uzbek Republic also has the All-Union Karakul Lamb Scientific Research Institute. These scientific research institutions have brilliant scientific achievements in cultivating new livestock breeds and improving existing breeds, improving pastures and grasslands, improving feeding management, modulating feed, and preventing and eliminating livestock diseases. Their scientific research work is closely integrated with practice and with mass animal husbandry production. In addition to having their own experimental bases - experimental stations and experimental farms - for scientific research work, they also widely and closely contact state farms and collective farms and conduct scientific research work in state farms and collective farms. Every achievement of scientific research work is quickly applied to animal husbandry production, and the practical experience in animal husbandry production is carefully studied, summarized, and improved, so that scientific research work can serve the development of animal husbandry well.

We were extremely excited to see the great achievements of the Soviet Union in developing animal husbandry during our visit to the Soviet Union. We deeply felt that the most fundamental reason why the Soviet Union was able to achieve great achievements in developing animal husbandry is that the Soviet Union's animal husbandry is socialist collectivized animal husbandry.

The Soviet Union regards animal husbandry as a component of agriculture and completed collectivization at the same time as or slightly later than agricultural collectivization. Under the wise leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, my country's agricultural cooperativization has achieved a great victory. This victory will undoubtedly promote a huge upsurge in agricultural production. I think that my country's animal husbandry should also basically follow the path of cooperativization like agriculture. Only in this way can animal husbandry production gain broad prospects for development.

    苏联发展畜牧业的巨大成就
    中国畜牧业参观团团长　王恩茂
    中国畜牧业参观团全体同志怀着非常兴奋的心情，从去年十月十八日到今年一月九日访问了伟大的社会主义国家——苏联。在这一时间内，我们到过莫斯科、斯大林格勒、塔什干、安吉然、撒马尔罕、伏龙芝、伊西克库里、阿拉木图、塔尔迪—库尔干等许多地方，参观了全苏农业展览会和各地许多集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场、工厂、学校和科学研究机关，参加了苏联共产党和政府为我们组织的数十次座谈会，满足了我们所要了解的苏联发展农业特别是发展畜牧业的巨大成就和先进经验的一切要求。我们得到了一次最好的学习机会。
    参观团的任务，主要是了解苏联发展畜牧业的巨大成就和先进经验。
    苏联的畜牧业是和农业同时实行了集体化的。由于畜牧业实行了集体化，才使畜牧业获得了广阔发展的前途。现在苏联的畜牧业超过了任何历史时期的发展水平。苏联1955年10月1日统计，共有牛6，700万头，羊12，490万只，猪5，210万口。虽然苏联集体农庄庄员按照苏联农业劳动组合示范章程还拥有相当数量的自有牲畜，但除猪外，公有牲畜占了苏联畜牧业中的主要地位。特别是集体农庄和国营农场向国家缴售的畜产品占了国家收购畜产品中的主要地位。苏联集体农庄和国营农场畜牧业的发展，对于满足人民畜产品需要和供给轻工业以畜产品原料具有决定性的意义。
    由于苏联建立和发展了强大的社会主义工业，这就不仅为农业而且也为畜牧业机械化和电气化创造了条件。苏联所以能够大量发展集体农庄和国营农场的畜牧业，是和畜牧业实行机械化和电气化分不开的。苏联国家供给了畜牧业生产大量的各种各样的机械装备。苏联在畜牧业为主的地区，设立有畜牧机器拖拉机站，供给集体农庄畜牧业生产使用的各种各样的机器装备；在农业为主的地区，以农业机器拖拉机站兼管供给集体农庄畜牧业生产使用的各种各样的机器装备。此外，集体农庄自己还拥有不少畜牧业生产的机械装备。我们在莫斯科、斯大林格勒、乌兹别克斯坦、吉尔吉斯、哈萨克斯坦看到许多集体农庄和国营农场的畜牧业生产都实行了综合机械化和电气化。畜牧业生产过程中的繁重劳动，都已完全或基本上为机械化和电气化所代替。苏联的养畜业已具有高度的机械化和电气化水平。
    苏联的畜牧业建立了强大的、巩固的饲料基地。苏联畜牧业工作者认为没有强大的、巩固的饲料基地，就将没有畜牧业稳定发展的保证。在苏联，不管是贫瘠土地、干旱草原、沙漠、半沙漠地带、高山地带、甚至高达拔海二千到四千公尺的高山地带，凡是可以利用的土地都充分地利用来作牧场、草场，并积极进行改善牧场、草场工作，使原来草不好和产草量低的牧场、草场，变成为草很好和产草量高的牧场、草场。我们在苏联看到的集体农庄和国营农场的畜牧业，都有巩固的饲料基地，它们虽都拥有一定面积的牧场、草场，但不是完全依靠自然牧场放牧，还大量地种植饲料作物，畜牧业是和农业紧密地结合的。
    苏联很重视牲畜品种改良工作，以加速提高牲畜和畜产品的质量和数量。目前，苏联除了改良了许多牲畜品种外，还培育了各种羊、牛、马和猪的新品种。牲畜新品种的质量、产品的质量和产品率都很高。例如，阿斯卡尼亚新品种的公羊活重平均为100—110公斤，最高达176公斤，剪毛量平均为10—14公斤，最高达29.4公斤，母羊活重平均为60—65公斤，最高达105公斤，剪毛量平均为5.5—6公斤。为了改良牲畜品种和培育新的品种，苏联的畜牧业科学研究机关进行了巨大的科学研究工作，建立了许多育种试验场、国家种畜场、国营种畜农场和集体农庄种畜场，单是改良和培育种牛、种羊、种马、种猪的国家种畜场和国营种畜农场就有496个。建立了大量的国家人工授精站、国营农场和集体农庄的人工授精站，现在全苏人工授精站将近三万个，形成了稠密的人工授精网。我们在苏联参观过的集体农庄和国营农场中的牛、羊、马几乎全部都是实行人工授精。
    苏联在重视改良牲畜品种的同时，强调了改进饲养管理，认为饲养管理的改进，不仅在提高牲畜产品率方面起着重大作用，而且在影响牲畜改变有机体和遗传性方面也起着重大作用。在改进饲养管理的条件下，可以大大提高牲畜品种质量和产品率，而在饲养管理不好的情况下，优良牲畜品种也将急剧退化和变质。我们看到了苏联在改进饲养管理方面所采取的许多措施：如增建近代化的畜舍，实行舍饲和牧场放牧相结合，扩大谷物播种面积，增加牲畜的精饲料，特别是强调多种玉米，增加牲畜多汁饲料，强调青贮饲料，实行青饲料轮牧，使牲畜在全年内能更多地吃到青饲料，普遍实行饲料调制，提高饲料的营养价值和口味，实行牲畜自动饮水和加喂必需的矿物质（食盐等），按照制定的饲料标准日量正确地进行饲养，对孕畜、幼畜和病畜分别饲养，并另定有日量标准。这些措施对于改良和提高牲畜品种的质量，增加牲畜产品率，都起了十分显著的作用。
    苏联兽医事业的巨大发展，是苏联畜牧业稳定发展的重要保证。目前在苏联已经消灭了严重危害牲畜发展的牛瘟、牛肺膜炎、马鼻疽、山羊肺膜炎等畜疫，炭疽病、口蹄疫、羊痘、猪丹毒和疥癣等畜疫也已基本上消灭。苏联十分强调牲畜疫病的预防工作，特别注意了解研究、检验和消灭牲畜传染病的媒介物——各种各样的传染病毒和微生物，在转运牲畜和畜产品的车站、码头上，在采购、加工和销售畜产品的时候，都严格地进行卫生检验工作，随时警惕牲畜传染病的发生，而当某一地方牲畜传染病发生时，就及时地迅速地予以消灭，对疫区实行封锁，禁止和其它地区牲畜来往，对其他地区的牲畜进行预防接种。预防接种，这是预防牲畜传染病的最有效的办法。苏联为了预防牲畜传染病，制造了五十六种生物药品，创造了预防畜疫的良好条件。苏联十分重视建立和加强兽医科学研究机关、兽医工作机关和兽医学校，全苏联有四个中央兽医科学研究所，各共和国、省有兽医科学研究所和兽医试验站，区有兽医、细菌实验所，在驱赶放牧中心有流动兽医实验所。苏联普遍建立和发展了兽医网，现在全国共有4，206个区的兽医治疗所，10，570个兽医工作段（为五到七个集体农庄服务），一万四千八百个兽医工作站（为一到二个集体农庄服务），630个城市兽医治疗所和二十七个兽医治疗站，此外，国营农场和大型的集体农庄还有自己的兽医机构。全国兽医机关共有兽医一万九千七百人，副兽医三千六百人，集体农庄共有兽医1，760人，兽医助理三万九千人。全苏现有三十七所兽医专科大学和兽医系培养兽医，有135所中等兽医学校培养兽医助理和兽医卫生员，每年从兽医大学毕业的学生有二千五百到三千名分配到机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄担任兽医工作。
    苏联畜牧业的科学研究工作，对于畜牧业的发展起了极其重大的作用。在莫斯科有全苏列宁农业科学院，有的共和国有它的分院，如我们参观过的哈萨克共和国就有全苏列宁农业科学院哈萨克分院，下设有畜牧科学研究所，牧场、饲料科学研究所，兽医科学研究所等。我们参观过的乌兹别克共和国和吉尔吉斯共和国都有畜牧科学研究所和其它科学研究机关。乌兹别克共和国还有全苏羔羊科学研究所。这些科学研究机构，对于培养牲畜新品种和改良原有品种，改善牧场、草场，改进饲养管理，调制饲料，预防和消灭牲畜疾病等方面，有着辉煌的科学成就。它们的科学研究工作紧密地和实践相结合，和群众畜牧业生产相结合。它们除了有自己的实验基地——实验站、实验场进行科学研究工作外，还广泛地和国营农场、集体农庄密切联系，在国营农场、集体农庄中进行科学研究工作。科学研究工作的每一个成果，都迅速地运用到畜牧业生产中去，而畜牧业生产中的实际经验，它们都认真地加以研究、总结和提高，使科学研究工作很好地为发展畜牧业服务。
    我们在苏联参观，看到了苏联发展畜牧业的巨大成就极为兴奋。深深感到苏联所以能够获得发展畜牧业的伟大成就，最基本的原因，是苏联的畜牧业是社会主义的集体化的畜牧业。
    苏联是把畜牧业作为农业的一个组成部分，是在农业集体化的同时或稍后一点完成集体化的。我国农业合作化在中共中央和毛主席的英明领导下，已获得了伟大胜利，这一胜利无疑将促进农业生产的巨大高涨。我想我国畜牧业也应当基本上和农业一样走合作化的道路，必须这样，才能使畜牧业生产获得广泛发展的前途。
