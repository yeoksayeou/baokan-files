    The Bearing Quality of Changzhi Machinery Factory is Still Poor
    Shi Xianyang
    On February 14th, the People's Daily criticized the poor product quality of the state-owned Changzhi Machinery Factory in Shanxi Province. The criticism was entirely correct, but the factory's leaders still did not learn from the lesson and strive to improve quality. Therefore, although the output of steel roller bearings exceeded the state plan by 47.83% in the first quarter of this year, the product scrap rate was as high as 34.9%. In terms of variety, some exceeded the target by a large margin, while others only completed 0.68% to 1.69% of the plan. Moreover, the more the output plan of a certain product was completed, the greater the scrap rate of that product.
    The leaders of Changzhi Machinery Factory believe that the main reasons for the poor product quality are poor equipment, low technical level, and unqualified raw materials. Of course, these objective factors do have an impact on product quality. However, this is not the main reason. Before 1954, the factory's bearing products were produced and sold by themselves, and the equipment and technical conditions were far inferior to what they are now, but the product quality was higher than it is now. At that time, the products were sold in Yunnan, Sichuan, Shandong, Hebei, Gansu, Northeast and other places, and were deeply welcomed by users. Since the beginning of 1955, after the products were uniformly sold by the China Communications and Electrical Company, it stands to reason that the enterprise leaders could concentrate their efforts on production, and the product quality should be higher, or at least not lower. However, they believed that with sales units, they had a backer and did not have to worry about sales. Therefore, they one-sidedly pursued quantity while neglecting to ensure product quality, and treated substandard and unqualified products as qualified products for delivery. Users have repeatedly criticized, but the leaders of this enterprise still did not take it seriously. By August of last year, the number of users decreased month by month, and the products could not be sold. The sales unit then revoked the sales contract, which forced the enterprise leaders to actively find ways to improve product quality, and successively sent people to various brother factories and mines to visit and learn, organize employees to learn technology, revise operating procedures, and strictly implement inspection systems. It can be said that a lot of preparatory work has been done for the mass production of bearings and the improvement of product quality. However, with the advent of the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, after the state required an increase in the annual output of bearings, the enterprise leaders once again believed that the threat of production stoppage due to poor quality was gone, and they no longer had to worry about selling their products. The original measures to improve product quality were also abandoned. For example, they formulated bearing quality indicators and technical regulations, but did not seriously explain them to the employees, nor did they organize the employees to learn them. As a result, the workers could not master them, and a large number of products were scrapped. On March 19th, the factory leaders saw that the output plan for the first quarter might not be completed, so they held an emergency meeting and kicked away the quality indicators they had originally formulated. For example, the original regulation stipulated that the radial runout tolerance of bearings should not exceed three threads, and they decided to change it to not exceed eighteen threads. On March 21st, they turned all 9,345 sets of bearings that were originally considered defective into qualified products and sent them to the ordering units.
    The above facts show that the poor product quality of this factory is mainly not because of poor equipment and low technical level, but because the leaders lack a sense of quality and a comprehensive sense of planning. Under the guidance of this wrong idea, no one paid attention to the many rationalization proposals for improving product quality put forward by the employees. For example, the proposal of foreman Zhang Xiaoniu to ensure that the radial runout and end face runout of the bearings meet the tolerance requirements was very effective after testing, but no one summarized and promoted it. Therefore, many workers and technicians said that as long as the leaders correct their thinking and rely on everyone, it is entirely possible to produce qualified products without increasing equipment.
    The bearings of Changzhi Machinery Factory are mainly supplied to local transportation enterprises, especially in rural areas. Poor bearing quality will cause losses to enterprises and affect agricultural production. Since the leaders of Changzhi Machinery Factory disregard user criticism and Party newspaper criticism, and blindly ignore quality, the leading organs such as the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry and the Changzhi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China need to seriously deal with this matter and give specific assistance so that this factory can improve product quality.

    长治机械厂的轴承质量仍然不好
    史宪阳
    二月十四日，人民日报曾经批评过山西省地方国营长治机械厂的产品质量不好。批评是完全正确的，但是这个厂的领导人仍不接受教训，努力提高质量。所以，今年第一季度钢滚轴承产量虽然超额完成国家计划47.83％，但是，产品报废率高到34.9％。从品种来看，有的超额完成很多，有的只完成计划0.68％至1.69％，而且哪一种产品的产量计划完成得越多，哪一种产品的报废率就越大。
    长治机械厂的领导人认为产品质量不好的主要原因是设备不好，技术水平低，原材料不合规格等。当然，这些客观因素：对产品质量确实有影响。但是，这并不是主要的原因。因为1954年以前，这个厂的轴承产品自产自销，设备、技术条件，远不如现在的好，产品质量反比现在的高。当时，产品销行于云南、四川、山东、河北、甘肃、东北等地，深受用户欢迎。自1955年初起，产品由中国交电公司统一包销以后，按理说，企业领导人可以集中力量搞生产了，产品质量应该更高，至少不应该降低。但是，他们认为有了包销单位，就有了靠山，就不愁销售了，所以，就片面追求数量，而忽视保证产品质量，把次品和不合格品充作合格品出厂。用户纷纷提出批评，这个企业的领导人，仍不以为然。到去年八月，用户逐月减少，产品卖不出去，包销单位便撤销包销合同，这才逼着企业领导人积极设法提高产品质量，先后派人到各兄弟厂矿参观学习，组织职工学习技术，修改操作规程，严格检验制度等。这对大量生产轴承，提高产品质量，可以说是做了不少的准备工作。但是，随着农业合作化高潮的到来，国家要求增加轴承年产量以后，企业领导人又认为因质量低劣而停产的威胁没有了，再也不愁卖不出去了。原来拟订的提高产品质量的措施也被抛弃了。如他们制定了轴承质量指标，制定了技术规程，然而没有认真地向职工交代，也没有组织职工学习，结果工人们掌握不了，产品大量报废。三月十九日，厂的领导人看到第一季度产量计划可能完不成了，就开了个紧急会议，把原来亲手制定的质量指标一脚踢开。如原规定轴承径向摆公差不得超过三丝，他们决定改为不得超过十八丝。在三月二十一日，他们把9，345盘原来被认为是废品的轴承，全部变为合格品发给订货单位。
    以上事实说明，这个厂的产品质量不好，主要的并不是因为设备不好，技术水平低，而是因为领导人缺乏质量观念，缺乏全面的计划观念。在这种错误思想指导下，职工们提出过许多提高产品质量的合理化建议也没人重视。如工段长张小牛提出的保证轴承的径向摆、端面摆达到公差要求的建议，经试验很有效，但是没有人去加以总结和推广。所以，许多工人和技术人员都说：只要领导人端正思想，依靠大家，在不增加设备的基础上，生产出合格的产品是完全可能的。
    长治机械厂的轴承，主要是供给地方交通企业，特别是农村使用。轴承质量不好，就会造成企业的损失，就要影响到农业生产。长治机械厂领导人既然不顾用户批评，不顾党报批评，而一味忽视质量，这就需要山西省工业厅、中共长治市委等领导机关对这件事情进行严肃处理，并且给以具体帮助，使这个厂能够提高产品质量。
