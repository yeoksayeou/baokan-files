More than six thousand outstanding individuals selected from various construction posts across the country have gathered in Beijing, the capital city they have long yearned for. They will attend the first grand National Advanced Producers Representative Conference in Chinese history on the 30th.

The eve of the conference opening was a Sunday. Batches of advanced producers wearing medals on their chests appeared on the streets of the capital, Tiananmen Square, and various public places. They received warm welcomes and respect from the people of Beijing. The Xinhua Bookstore's outlet selling science and technology books was even more crowded than usual. The Summer Palace, Beihai Park, and the Working People's Cultural Palace all received guests from afar on the 29th.

The representatives gathered in the capital brought with them their superior achievements and rich advanced experiences in socialist construction. Among them were steelmaking experts from Anshan; train drivers who have safely traveled hundreds of thousands of kilometers; coal miners, machine workers, petroleum workers, and workers manufacturing various daily necessities who have mastered new technologies and continuously improved production efficiency; geological prospectors who search for mineral resources all over the country; herdsmen who live on the grasslands year-round; road builders on the Kangzang Plateau; and seafarers who brave the waves on the sea. In this group of outstanding individuals, there are also many postal workers, telegraph operators, typists, cashiers, cooks, and childcare workers who have created extraordinary achievements in ordinary jobs; as well as nationally renowned scientists, writers, artists, and athletes.

Sheng Li, a nationally famous high-speed cutting lathe operator, quickly became good friends with Zhan Shuijing, an excellent lathe operator from Dalian Shipyard, after arriving in Beijing. The two cutting experts discovered each other's many advantages as soon as they met. Zhan Shuijing found that Sheng Li's cutting tool angle was very appropriate, resulting in high cutting efficiency. Sheng Li also noticed Zhan Shuijing's emphasis on product quality.

Yan Jinan, a geological engineer from the Qilian Mountains, has been living in the sparsely populated Qilian Mountains for the past few years. He and his prospecting team have found many valuable minerals in the Qilian Mountains, proving that the Qilian Mountains are a rare multi-metal deposit in the world.

Among the first batch of combined coal mining machine operators in our country, Song Jiwu is an expert who can mine 13,000 tons of coal a month. This time, in Beijing, he learned the experience of mining 25,000 tons of coal per month from Soviet advanced combined coal mining machine operator Jiemidaoweichi.

The eight petroleum exploration team members from the Qaidam Basin found petroleum exploration team members from Xinjiang, Yumen, and Sichuan as soon as they arrived in Beijing. They exchanged experiences with each other. Although they have only been here for three or four days, they have already learned a lot of good experiences.

Li Qichi, the best pilot in China's civil aviation serving agriculture and forestry, also rushed to the capital from the Greater Khingan Mountains. Du Yuanli from Chongqing also met his old friend Wu Qingxiang in the capital. They were originally pilots who revolted and returned from Hong Kong together. Now they have become excellent pilots of the People's China.

Among the female advanced producer representatives is a young stoker named Jin Suzhen. With the help of veteran workers, she and two other female workers in the same group learned the stoker technology to master a state-of-the-art automatic boiler in less than two years. This boiler has been running safely for 777 days and has been named "March 8th Furnace."

Garma, a Tibetan advanced producer from Lhasa, is a road builder on the Kangzang Plateau. This is his first time in Beijing, and he feels that there are too many new things in the capital of the motherland, and he is too busy to see them all.

Among the advanced figures is also cotton-growing expert Liu Xuefo. In the cotton fields he managed, the best mu of cotton yielded 1,400 jin.

Writers Lao She, Cao Yu, and drama director Jiao Juyin have been preparing to attend this conference in recent days, while also busily visiting advanced figures on various fronts, preparing to write about their advanced deeds. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    大会开幕的前夕，正是星期天。成批的胸前挂着奖章的先进生产者，出现在首都街头、天安门广场和各个公共场所。他们受到了北京人民的热情接待和尊敬。新华书店出售科学技术书籍的门市部比平日更加拥挤。颐和园、北海公园、劳动人民文化宫二十九日都接待了来自远方的客人。
    汇集首都的代表们，带来了他们在社会主义建设中优越的成就和丰富的先进经验。他们之中，有来自鞍山的炼钢能手；有安全行驶几十万公里的火车司机；有掌握新技术、不断提高生产效率的采煤工人、机械工人、石油工人和制造各种生活日用品的工人；有遍布祖国各地寻找矿产资源的地质勘探人员；有常年生活在草原上的牧人；有康藏高原的筑路工人；有乘风破浪活跃在海上的海轮驾驶员。在这个优秀人物的行列中，还有许多在平凡的工作岗位上创造了非凡成绩的邮递员、报务员、打字员、出纳员、炊事员、保育员；也有全国闻名的科学家、作家、艺术家和运动员。
    全国著名的高速切削车工盛利来到北京后，很快就和大连造船公司的优秀车工詹水晶结成了要好的朋友。这两个切削能手一见面，都发现了对方的许多优点。詹水晶发现盛利切削刀的角度放得很合适，因此切削效率很高。盛利也注意到詹水晶重视产品质量的特点。

    在我国第一批联合采煤机手中，宋继武是一个月能采一万三千吨煤的能手。这次，他在北京向苏联的先进联合采煤机手捷米道维赤学会了月采二万五千吨煤的经验。
    来自柴达木盆地的八个石油勘探队员，一到北京就找到了新疆、玉门和四川的石油勘探队员。他们互相交流了经验。虽然他们只来了三四天，可是已经学会了不少好经验。

    从拉萨来的藏族先进生产者噶玛，是康藏高原的公路建设者。他是第一次来到北京，他感到祖国首都的新事物太多了，忙得他看不过来。
    先进人物的行列中，还有植棉能手刘学佛，他管理的棉田中，棉花长得最好的一亩曾收获一千四百斤。
    作家老舍、曹禺和话剧导演焦菊隐，最近几天一面准备出席这次会议，一面又忙碌地访问各个战线上的先进人物，准备把他们的先进事迹写出来。（据新华社讯）
