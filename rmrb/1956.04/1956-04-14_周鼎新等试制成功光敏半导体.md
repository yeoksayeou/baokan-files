Zhou Dingxin and others successfully trial-produce photosensitive semiconductor

One of the latest achievements in world science—cadmium sulfide photosensitive semiconductor—has been successfully trial-produced by Zhou Dingxin, a young technician at the state-owned Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory, and another technician, Huang Daorong.

This "semiconductor" is particularly sensitive to light. When reporters visited, technicians were installing photoelectric control equipment made of polycrystalline cadmium sulfide on a faucet for testing. A light bulb was placed to the left of the faucet, and the light shone directly on the photoelectric tube. When people put their hands under the faucet, their hands blocked the light, and water flowed out with a gurgle. When they retracted their hands, the faucet immediately turned off. This is the effect of the control equipment made of polycrystalline cadmium sulfide photosensitive semiconductor. This control equipment can be used in the steel plate rolling industry to automatically control the thickness of steel plates; in general factory presses, it can prevent accidents; if street lights are equipped with this control equipment, it will automatically turn on when it gets dark. This polycrystalline cadmium sulfide also has significant applications in the peaceful use of atomic energy and other research work. Currently, the first batch of trial-produced products are being appraised at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. Zhou Dingxin and Huang Daorong are also using this semiconductor to manufacture a light-conducting fluorescent screen for X-ray machines. If the trial production is successful, the X-ray machine will not need to be placed in a darkroom and can be used in bright light, and its size can be greatly reduced.

    周鼎新等试制成功光敏半导体
    世界科学上最新成就之一——硫化镉光敏半导体，已由国营上海精密医疗器械厂青年技术员周鼎新和另一技术员黄道荣试制成功。
    这种“半导体”对光的感觉特别灵敏，记者去访问的时候，技术人员们正把多晶体硫化镉做成的光电管控制设备装在水龙头上进行试验，水龙头的左边放着一盏电灯，光线直接射向光电管，当人们把手伸到水龙头下面的时候，手把光线遮断了，水就哗哗地流出来；把手一缩，水龙头也立刻关上了，这就是多晶体硫化镉光敏半导体做成的控制设备发生的作用。这种控制设备，用在轧钢板工业上，可以自动控制钢板的厚薄；用在一般工厂的冲床上，可以防止伤害事故；如果街道上的电灯装了这种控制设备，天黑的时候，它就会自动地亮起来。这种多晶体硫化镉，在和平利用原子能和其他研究工作方面，也都有重大作用。现在，试制成的第一批产品正在北京中国科学院进行鉴定。周鼎新和黄道荣还正在利用这种半导体，制造一种爱克斯光机上用的光导荧光屏，如果试制成功，那末爱克斯光机就不必放在暗室里，在亮光中也可以透视了，它的体积也可以大大缩小。
