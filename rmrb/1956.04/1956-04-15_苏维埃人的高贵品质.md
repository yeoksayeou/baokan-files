    The Noble Qualities of Soviet People
    Pokataev, a young worker in the cold forging workshop of the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, fell into a corrosive tank with a temperature of over 90 degrees Celsius and suffered severe burns. He was sent to the factory hospital for treatment. Doctors tried various medical methods without success. The patient's condition was critical. At this time, surgeon Polyak decided to use skin grafts to treat the burned body. When the doctor informed the workshop of this decision, five young men and women from the factory, Stoyanova, Cherdyshev, Pyatakova, Zhdanov, and Kostromin, immediately expressed their willingness to donate skin from their own bodies to cure Pokataev's illness. After the doctor transplanted 200 square centimeters of skin to treat the patient, the patient, whose condition was very critical, was saved.
    In Balkhash, Kazakhstan, a five-year-old child ran into the street to pick up a toy that had rolled away. At that moment, a truck sped towards him, only a few meters away from the child picking up the toy. It looked like the child was in danger. Suddenly, a young woman in the crowd rushed towards the truck without hesitation. She pulled the child to safety, but she was knocked down and injured by the front grille of the truck. She was sent to the hospital. The news of this selfless act quickly spread throughout Balkhash. When Bala Katkevich, a female student at the factory apprentice school, recovered, the parents of the child she had rescued and many others came to thank her. She said, "I couldn't help but do it. When I was little, I was also saved from death. It was during the war. Our soldiers carried me out of a burning house."
    These two incidents demonstrate the noble quality of selflessness among the Soviet people.

    苏维埃人的高贵品质
    车里雅宾斯克拖拉机制造厂冷锻车间的青年工人波卡塔也夫跌入了温度在九十度以上的腐蚀槽中，受了严重的烫伤。他被送到工厂的医院去诊治。医生们采取种种医疗办法都没有效果。病人的病状十分危急。这个时候，外科医生波里雅克决定了用移植皮肤到受烫伤的机体上去的办法来进行治疗。当医生把这个决定通知车间的时候，这个工厂的斯托雅诺娃、切尔狄舍夫、彼雅塔科娃、日达诺夫、克斯特罗明等五名男女青年，立即表示愿意割下自己身上的皮肤来治好波卡塔也夫的疾病。当医生移植了二百平方公分的皮肤对病人进行了治疗以后，这个病情十分危急的病人得救了。
    在哈萨克斯坦的巴尔哈什，一个五岁的小孩跑到街心去拣滚落的玩具。正在这个时候，一辆卡车疾驰而来，离拣玩具的孩子不到几公尺的距离了。眼看小孩就要遇到危险了。忽然人群里有一位女青年毫不犹豫地奔向卡车。她把小孩救在一边，自己却被卡车的前栅撞倒而受伤了。她被送到医院去。这个舍己为人的消息，很快就在巴尔哈什传开了。当这个工厂艺徒学校女学生巴拉·卡特克维奇被治好的时候，被她救出险境的孩子的父母和许多人都来向她致谢。她说：“我当时不能不这样做。我小的时候，也是从死里被救出来的。那是在战争时期。我们的士兵把我从被焚的房子里背出来。”
    从这两件事情里可以看出苏维埃人的舍己为人的高贵品质。
