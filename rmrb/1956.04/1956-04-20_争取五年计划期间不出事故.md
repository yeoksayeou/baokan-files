    Suzhou Electric Power Plant’s Steam Turbine Workshop's Sun Li team has created a new record of 1,916 days of safe operation since participating in the labor competition in 1951. This team has consistently focused on learning advanced production technology, diligently implementing operating procedures, and thoroughly implementing regular inspection systems, successively eliminating over a dozen hidden potential accidents. In 1955, this group received the title of Model Group six times in a row. Currently, this group is formulating measures to strive for no accidents during the first Five-Year Plan period.

    争取五年计划期间不出事故
    苏州电厂汽机车间孙立挑班，从1951年参加劳动竞赛以来，已经创造安全运行1，916天的新纪录。这个班一贯注意学习先进生产技术，认真执行运行规程，并且贯彻执行了定期检查等制度，先后消灭了隐形事故十几次。这个小组在1955年曾经连续六次获得模范小组等称号。目前，这个小组正在拟定措施，争取在第一个五年计划期间不发生任何事故。
