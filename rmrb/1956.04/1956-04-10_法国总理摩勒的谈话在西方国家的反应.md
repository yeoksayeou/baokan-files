Xinhua News Agency, April 9th – French Premier Mollet's interview with "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, which criticized Western foreign policy, has elicited widespread reactions in the United States, Britain, and France.

    The American ruling clique is annoyed and uneasy about Mollet's remarks. According to a United Press report, Washington government officials expressed "strong disagreement" with Mollet's assertion that the so-called "Soviet aggression" threat is non-existent, and they expressed doubt about Mollet's call for the West to adopt "new tactics." These officials expressed "surprise" at Mollet's suggestion that the disarmament issue and European security issues should be resolved first in order to smoothly resolve the German reunification issue. At the same time, representatives of American monopoly capital groups threatened France, saying they would retaliate against France by canceling dollar "subsidies." In American newspapers, there have been blatant attacks on the French government's attempt to break free from American constraints.

    In London, Reuters reported that Mollet's remarks have caused "serious concern" among British officials. London sources believe this interview demonstrates "far-reaching divisions" among the Western powers. At the same time, British press commentary has shown considerable sympathy for Mollet's views. These commentaries believe that many of Mollet's criticisms of Western policy are well-founded. The "New Statesman and Nation" weekly said that the French Prime Minister has become more popular because of his "profound and thorough indictment of Western policy." The pro-government "Daily Mail" agreed with Mollet's statement that the United States often "competes" with its other "allies." In this regard, it emphasized that Britain and the United States do not have a common policy in the Middle East, and "whenever the United States takes action (in the Middle East), it is often against Britain." The newspaper also supported Mollet's assertion that Americans are hated because they always give orders while providing financial assistance. Some British newspapers pointed out that the French authorities have already voiced their opinions, and the British side should act promptly and learn from the French example.

    Within France, Mollet's remarks have been warmly welcomed by the general public. They particularly approve of the view expressed in Mollet's interview that France is capable of actively defending its rights and interests on the world political stage and promoting the general normalization of international relations. Although a few French politicians who are infatuated with the bankrupt "Atlantic policy" are panic-stricken by the interview, a broad range of political figures have reacted favorably. Left-wing members of the French Parliament support this initiative aimed at restoring France's diplomatic independence, and many right-wing members have also taken a positive attitude towards this initiative.

    French press commentary notes with satisfaction that Mollet has begun to abandon the obsequious policies of Bidault and Pinay in the past and is following a more independent course. Some French newspapers hope that the French Prime Minister's remarks can be transformed into concrete measures by the French diplomatic authorities to consolidate and expand international cooperation.

    法国总理摩勒的谈话在西方国家的反应
    新华社9日讯　法国总理摩勒对“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志发表的批评西方外交政策的谈话，在美国、英国和法国国内引起了广泛的反应。
    美国统治集团对摩勒的谈话感到恼怒和不安。据合众社报道，华盛顿政府官员表示“非常不同意”摩勒认为所谓“苏联侵略”的威胁根本不存在的说法，并且对摩勒要求西方采取“新的策略”这一点表示怀疑。这些官员对于摩勒提出的应当首先解决裁军问题和欧洲安全问题才能顺利解决德国统一问题的意见表示“惊讶”。同时，美国垄断资本集团的代表们对法国发出威胁，他们表示要用取消对法国的美元“补助”的办法来对付法国。在美国报纸上，出现了对于法国政府企图摆脱美国束缚的粗暴的攻击。
    在伦敦，据路透社报道，摩勒的谈话引起英国官方人士的“严重关切”，伦敦人士认为这个谈话证明西方大国之间“发生了影响深远的分歧”。同时，英国报刊的评论对摩勒的观点表现了相当广泛的同情。这些评论认为摩勒对西方政策的许多批评是很有根据的。“新政治家与民族”周刊说，法国总理由于他的“对西方政策的深刻的和彻底的告发状”而更加受人欢迎了。支持政府的“每日邮报”同意摩勒关于美国往往同其他“盟国”“彼此竞争”的说法，它在这方面强调说，英国和美国在中东没有共同的政策，而且“只要美国（在中东）有所行动，那常常是反对英国的”。这家报纸还支持摩勒的这种说法：美国人受到憎恶，因为他们在给予财政援助的同时总是要给予吩咐。有些英国报刊指出，法国当局已经发表了自己的意见，英国方面也应该即时行动，并且学习法国的榜样。
    在法国国内，摩勒谈话受到广大公众的热烈欢迎。他们特别赞成摩勒谈话中所表示的这种意见：法国有能力在世界政治舞台上积极保卫自己的权利和利益以及促进国际关系普遍正常化。虽然少数迷恋破产了的“大西洋政策”法国政客对这篇谈话感到惊慌失措，但是广泛的政界人士却反应良好。法国议会的左翼议员支持这种目的在于恢复法国外交独立的主动，不少右翼议员也对这种主动性采取了良好态度。
    法国报界评论满意地指出，摩勒已经开始放弃过去皮杜尔、比内的卑躬屈节的政策，而遵循比较独立的路线。某些法国报纸希望，法国总理的谈话能够化为法国外交当局争取巩固和扩大国际合作的具体措施。
