Organize Peddlers to Go to the Countryside to Support Spring Plowing
Zhang Chengxin

Since the beginning of spring, a vigorous spring plowing production movement has been widely launched in the rural areas of Hubei Province, and fewer and fewer farmers are buying things in the market. As a result, the market is not very active, and the purchasing and sales plans of the commercial departments are not being completed very well. To solve this problem, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hubei have led joint state-private stores, cooperative stores, purchasing and sales agents, distributors, and mobile peddlers to organize peddlers to deliver goods to the countryside.

The peddlers going to the countryside have adopted a variety of sales methods according to the different conditions in various places. Some collect goods door-to-door and deliver goods to the door; some set up fixed stalls and display goods on the spot; some order goods at a fixed time, order first and then deliver; some go deep into the fields; some catch up with evening gatherings. The Taipingdian store in Xiangyang County organized 18 people to deliver goods to the Cihefan water conservancy construction site, and the goods sold in three days were worth 1,776 yuan. The Wulu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yunmeng County used the evening time to send peddlers to exhibit and promote sales. They signed pre-sale contracts with agricultural cooperatives in WuPu Township, pre-selling a total of double-wheeled double-plow plows, fertilizers and other means of production, worth 13,840 yuan, and also promoted daily necessities such as department stores, cloth, and stationery to agricultural cooperatives, worth 2,261 yuan. Jia Yutang, a peddler in Yangdang, Zhaoyang County, only sold one or two yuan a day when he first went to the countryside. Later, he changed his business methods. In addition to directly delivering goods to the fields and water conservancy construction sites to meet with farmers, he also paid attention to the time when farmers went home for meals in the morning, noon, and evening, and delivered goods to their doors.

Sending goods to the countryside is an important measure to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state's purchasing and sales plans. In YingShan County, five districts organized 505 peddlers to go to the countryside. In less than half a month, the purchased local and special products were worth 4,077 yuan, and the goods sold were worth 10,288 yuan. In Zhaoyang County, 22 mobile roaming purchasing and sales groups were sent out in the Yangdang district. Within one month, the sales volume reached 4,796 yuan, and a lot of scrap copper, waste tin, eggs, sesame, etc. were purchased. After the Banbiandian Supply and Marketing Cooperative branch in Huangpi County organized two loads of goods to go to the countryside, the sales volume increased by 36% compared with the usual, and the purchase volume increased by 86%. After the Zhangwan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xiangyang County sent goods to the countryside, the wholesale turnover in five days increased by 119.9% compared with five days ago. The Caoshi District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiangling County had overstocked more than 2,000 kilograms of bacon and more than 1,500 kilograms of candy after the Spring Festival, which were all sold out in the process of delivering goods to the countryside.

Organizing the delivery of goods to the countryside can also educate private merchants to establish the concept of serving production and consumers, and give play to their enthusiasm for management. At this time last year in Caoshi, Jiangling County, because there was not much market trading, many private merchants had difficulties in business and life. The state issued loans of 260 yuan, and a few households relied on government relief funds to eat. The situation this year is very different. According to the statistics of the six industries of department stores, cloth, groceries, egg products, food, and green fruits that deliver goods to the countryside, the turnover from February 21 to March 10 this year was 8,890 yuan, which is 2.8 times that of the same period last year (of which the turnover of goods delivered to the countryside accounted for 51.1%). They themselves estimate that in the off-season from March to May, after deducting various expenses, each person can get a monthly income equivalent to the basic salary plus bonus salary in the peak season. The fact that delivering goods to the countryside is warmly welcomed by the vast number of farmers is a great encouragement and education to private merchants and small vendors. Many personnel in joint state-private stores were originally worried that the market would enter the off-season and that there would be difficulties in operation, and their emotions were very depressed, but now they have become active. After the small vendors in Caoshi, Jiangling went to the countryside, they added more than 280 small commodities such as straw sandals, manure baskets, top rings, net covers, and combs according to the needs of the farmers.

However, the work of organizing the delivery of goods to the countryside by commercial departments in Hubei Province is uneven. Some commercial departments in some areas, due to insufficient understanding of the new situation and new changes in rural areas, are afraid of suffering when going to the countryside and are afraid of "losing face" by carrying a peddler's burden, and still hold on to the business attitude of "waiting for customers to come to the door." There are still many problems in areas where the work of delivering goods to the countryside has already been carried out. Some state-owned commercial institutions and supply and marketing cooperatives are afraid that their retail plans cannot be completed, and the supply of goods for small vendors who deliver goods to the countryside is very tightly controlled. Some even simply start from promoting residual and stagnant goods and overstocked goods, and send those unsalable goods to the countryside. Some stipulate that the handling fees for purchasing and selling on behalf of small vendors are too low; the regional price differences are unreasonable. For these problems, various localities are taking measures to solve them. Commercial departments throughout the province will further develop the work of delivering goods to the countryside, overcome the difficulties in the commercial off-season, and support spring plowing production.

    组织货郎担下乡，支援春耕生产
    张成信
    入春以来，湖北省农村中广泛掀起了热火朝天的春耕生产运动，农民到市场上买东西的逐渐稀少了。这样，市场也不很活跃了，商业部门的购销计划都完成得很不好。为了解决这个问题，湖北各地国营商业部门和供销合作社带领公私合营商店、合作商店、代购代销店、经销店和流动的小商小贩等，组织货郎担，送货下乡。
    下乡的货郎担根据各地的不同情况，采取了多种多样的推销方法。有的登门收购，送货上门；有的固定摆摊，就地展览；有的定货定时，先定后送；有的深入田间；有的夜晚赶会。襄阳县太平店组织十八个人送货到茨河畈水利工程工地，三天销售的货物就值一千七百七十六元。云梦县五洛区供销社利用夜晚时间，派出货郎担边展览，边推销。他们在吴铺乡同农业合作社订立预售合同，总共预售双轮双铧犁、肥料等生产资料，共值一万三千八百四十元，还向农业合作社推销了百货、布匹、文具等生活用品，共值二千二百六十一元。枣阳县杨壋送货小贩贾玉堂开始下乡的时候，每天只卖一、两块钱，后来他改变营业方式，除了把货直接送到田畈里和水利工地上同农民见面外，还注意赶早、中、晚农民回家吃饭的时间，送货上门。
    送货下乡是保证完成和超额完成国家购销计划的重要措施。应山县五个区组织五百零五个货郎担下乡，不到半个月，收购的土特产品共值四千零七十七元，推销的货物共值一万零二百八十八元。枣阳县杨壋区派出二十二个流动串乡购销组，一个月内，销货额达四千七百九十六元，并收购了很多杂铜、废锡、鸡蛋、芝麻等。黄陂县半边店供销社分店组织两个担子下乡以后，销售额较平常上升36％，收购额上升86％。襄阳县张塆区供销社，送货下乡以后五天的批发营业额比五天前上升119.9％。江陵县草市区供销社，在春节以后，积压腊肉二千多斤，糖果一千五百多斤，在送货下乡中全部销光了。
    组织送货下乡，还可以教育私商树立为生产和为消费者服务的观点，发挥他们的经营积极性。江陵县草市在去年这个时候，因为市场买卖不多，许多私商在经营上和生活上都很困难，国家发放了贷款二百六十元，还有几户依靠政府发救济款吃饭。今年这个时候的情况大不相同了，根据送货下乡的百货、布匹、杂货、蛋品、食品、青果等六个行业的统计，今年二月二十一日至三月十日的营业额为八千八百九十元，等于去年同期的二点八倍（其中送货下乡营业额占51.1％）。他们自己预计在三至五月的淡季中，除去各项费用开支，每人每月可以得到相当于旺季的基本工资加奖励工资的收入。送货下乡受到广大农民的热烈欢迎的事实，对私商和小商贩，是一个很大的鼓舞和教育。许多公私合营商店的人员原来顾虑市场进入淡季，经营有困难，情绪很消沉，现在也积极起来了。江陵草市小商贩下乡以后，根据农民要求，增加了草鞋、粪筐、顶圈、网罩、篦子等二百八十多个细小商品。
    但是，湖北省商业部门组织送货下乡的工作是不平衡的，有些地区商业部门，由于对农村的新形势和新变化认识不足，怕下乡吃苦，怕挑货郎担“丢面子”，仍然抱着“等客上门”的经营态度。已经开展送货下乡工作的地区也还有不少问题，有的国营商业机构和供销社害怕自己的零售计划不能完成，对送货下乡的小商贩的货源控制得很紧，有的甚至单纯从推销残滞商品和积压的商品出发，把那些不适销的货送到乡下去。有的对小商贩代购代销的手续费规定得偏低；地区差价不合理。对于这些问题，各地正在采取措施，加以解决。全省各地的商业部门将要进一步开展送货下乡工作，克服商业淡季中的困难，支援春耕生产。
