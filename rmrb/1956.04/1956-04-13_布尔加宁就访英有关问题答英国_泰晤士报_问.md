Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 12th: TASS reports that the British "Times" requested the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, to answer some questions related to the upcoming visit to Britain by N.S. Khrushchev and N.A. Bulganin.

The following are the questions raised by the "Times" and the answers given by N.A. Bulganin.

Question: What is the purpose of this visit to England?

Answer: N.S. Khrushchev and I are visiting England at the invitation of the British government. During our stay in Britain, we intend to discuss issues that are of primary interest to both of our countries.

Although it is impossible to predetermine the results we expect from our talks with the British government, it can be said that personal contact between national leaders of different countries is an effective means of building mutual understanding on difficult and contentious issues. It may be useful to recall, for example, how beneficial personal contact between national leaders was in resolving the Austrian question, in restoring friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, in developing friendly relations between the Soviet Union and many Asian countries, and in many other events. The experience of our time shows that negotiation is the better method of settling these or those international issues.

Question: Can this visit help to ease international tensions?

Answer: We hope so, and we on our side will make every effort to ensure that our visit to Britain helps to ease international tensions. The Soviet government and people believe that great powers should follow their common interests in their relations, and their primary concern should be to prevent the outbreak of a new war and to establish normal and good relations between all countries.

If we receive a due response to the desire to ease tensions, then this visit will undoubtedly achieve good results.

Question: One hears abroad that there is a contradiction between the remarks you made during your visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan and the current remarks about friendship with Britain. Can you comment on this?

Answer: The Soviet Union hopes to further improve relations with Britain, France, the United States, and all other countries, believing that good relations and friendship between peoples of all countries help to maintain and consolidate world peace.

In maintaining peace, the British, French, Americans, and all other peoples are no less concerned than the Soviets.

Friendship with all countries, including Britain, and the establishment of further mutual understanding are the unchanging principles of Soviet foreign policy.

The Soviet people have always respected the British people and sincerely desire to maintain friendly relations with them. Only those who ignore the truth would insist that the remarks made by Soviet national leaders during their visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan were against the establishment of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Britain.

Question: One hears abroad the opinion that the purpose of this visit to England is to alienate Britain from the United States. Can you please comment on this?

Answer: When the Soviet Union hopes to establish good and friendly relations with any country, it does not require that country to reject friendship with any other country. Our country also hopes to be friendly with Britain's friends, and we do not need to make Britain lose its friends.

The Soviet government hopes to establish friendly relations with Britain, as well as with France, the United States, and other countries. Paying great attention to establishing such relations with all countries, in order to consolidate peace and security, as everyone knows, the Soviet government is taking various measures to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The peoples of both the Soviet Union and the United States hope to improve relations, and there are no insurmountable obstacles to establishing good neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Question: What are the possibilities for expanding trade between Britain and the Soviet Union, and can it be expected that this visit to England will promote this? Would expanding trade be mutually beneficial to both countries?

Answer: Trade is better than estrangement, especially better than hostility between nations. Broad trade between the Soviet Union and Britain would be an important stimulus for the development of cooperation in other areas.

As for the possibility of expanding trade between our two countries, such possibilities are great. The Soviet government is prepared to greatly expand Anglo-Soviet trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, on the one hand increasing the various commodities that are currently usually exported, and also expanding new commodity categories. If the obstacles to such trade can be removed, that is, to eliminate those kinds of restrictions that are not implemented by us, which in themselves are a strange historical error, then both countries can obtain considerable benefits from them. Undoubtedly, expanding trade will not only help to improve the living standards of the people of both countries, but also help to clarify the political situation.

Question: Prime Minister Eden believes that the purpose of the visit is: "to discuss disputes and explore common ground." Do you think it is possible to find "common ground"?

Answer: As for us, the Soviet government hopes to seek mutual understanding and an approximation of views and positions on issues of concern to both sides, forming an atmosphere of trust between our two countries, thereby promoting further improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and Britain, which will promote the consolidation of peace in Europe and other parts of the world. There is sufficient basis for achieving such a meeting result, and everything depends on whether the two countries have the necessary sincerity to seek ways to bring their positions closer and consistent on the issues to be discussed. Reaching an agreement requires overcoming certain difficulties, but we have never regarded difficulties as insurmountable obstacles, as long as both sides take the principles of peaceful coexistence between countries as the basis for negotiations, and as long as both sides take into account the mutual interests in ensuring peace and the security of the peoples of all countries.

Question: What are the main issues to be discussed with British leaders?

Answer: Both sides will discuss those issues that the participants in this meeting are willing to raise. Only this can be stated in advance: issues that directly or indirectly harm countries that are not participating in the Soviet-British leadership meeting will not be discussed. What will be discussed first and foremost are issues concerning the development of trade between our two countries and the expansion of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain, as well as other international issues which, once resolved, would help to further ease international tensions and consolidate world peace.

    布尔加宁就访英有关问题答英国“泰晤士报”问
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：英国“泰晤士报”请求苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁答复同尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和尼·亚·布尔加宁这次访问英国有关的一些问题。
    下面是“泰晤士报”提出的问题和尼·亚·布尔加宁的答复。
    问：这次访问英国的目的是什么？
    答：尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和我应英国政府的邀请访问英国。在我们在英国停留期间，我们打算讨论首先使我们两国感到兴趣的问题。
    虽然不能预先决定我们对我们这次同英国政府会谈所期望的结果，但是可以说，不同国家的国家领导人的个人接触是在困难和有争论的问题上建立相互谅解的有效手段。可以提醒一点，例如，在解决奥地利问题上，在恢复苏联同南斯拉夫的友谊联系上，在发展苏联同许多亚洲国家的友好关系上和在许多其他的事件上，国家领导人的个人接触起了多么良好的作用。我们这个时代的经验表明，在调整这些或那些国际问题上，谈判是比较好的方法。
    问：这次访问是不是可以有助于缓和国际紧张局势？
    答：我们希望如此，我们这一方面将尽一切努力使我们的访问英国有助于缓和国际紧张局势。苏联政府和人民认为，大国在它们的关系中应当遵循它们的共同利益，它们的主要关心应该是不允许新战争的发生和建立各国正常的良好关系。
    如果我们得到对缓和紧张局势的愿望的应有的响应，那么这次访问毫无疑问将会取得良好的结果。
    问：在外国可以听到有这样一种说法，认为你们在访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗时所发表的言论和现在关于对英国友好的言论之间有矛盾。您能不能对这一点发表一下自己的看法。
    答：苏联希望进一步改进同英国、法国、美国以及所有其他各国的关系，认为各国人民的良好关系和友谊有助于维护和巩固世界和平。
    而在维护和平方面，英国人、法国人、美国人和所有其他各国人民也并不比苏联人关心得少。
    同包括英国在内的所有国家友好和建立进一步的相互谅解是苏联外交政策永远不变的原则。
    苏联人民还一向尊重英国人民，并且真诚愿望同他们保持友好的关系。只有无视真相的人才硬说，苏联国家领导人在访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗期间发表的言论是反对苏英两国建立友好的关系的。
    问：在外国可以听到这种意见：这次访问英国的目的是要离间英国和美国。是不是可以请你谈谈对这个问题的见解？
    答：当苏联希望同任何一个国家建立良好的、友好关系的时候，它并不需要这一个国家拒绝同任何其他国家的友谊。我们的国家也希望同英国的朋友友好，我们没有必要使英国失去它的朋友。
    苏联政府希望同英国，也希望同法国、美国和其他国家建立友好的关系。由于十分重视同一切国家建立这种关系，以有利于巩固和平和安全，大家知道，苏联政府正在采取各种措施来改善苏美两国的关系。苏联和美国两国人民都希望改善关系，为了建立苏美两国的善邻关系，没有不能够消除的障碍。
    问：英国和苏联两国扩大贸易的可能性怎样，是不是可以期望这次访问英国会促进这一点？扩大贸易对两国会不会是互利的？
    答：贸易比疏远要好，尤其是比国家与国家的仇视要好。苏联和英国的广泛贸易将会是发展其他方面的合作的一个重要刺激因素。
    至于谈到扩大我们两国贸易的可能性，那么这种可能性是很大的。苏联政府准备在平等互利的基础上大大扩大英苏贸易，一方面增加现在通常出口的各种商品，同时也扩大新的商品种类。如果能够消除对这种贸易的障碍，也就是消除那些不是我们所实施的、它的本身是一种奇怪的历史错误的形形色色的限制，那末两国就能从中得到十分可观的好处。毫无疑问，扩大贸易不仅有助于提高两国人民的生活水平，而且有助于使政局明朗起来。
    问：艾登首相认为访问的目的是：“讨论纠纷问题，探讨共同的基础”。你认为，是不是能够找到“共同的基础”？
    答：谈到我们，那末苏联政府希望求得互相的谅解和在双方有关的问题上求得观点和立场的接近，形成我们两国之间的信任的气氛，从而促进苏联和英国的关系进一步改善，这样就会促进欧洲和世界其他地区的和平的巩固。要达到这样一个会谈结果，是有足够的根据的，一切全都要看两国是不是有应有的诚意来寻求使双方在所要讨论的问题上立场趋于接近和一致的途径。达成协议是要克服一定的困难的，可是我们从来没有把困难看作不可克服的障碍，只要双方都把各国和平共处的原则作为谈判的基础，只要双方都考虑到在保障和平和各国人民安全方面的互相利益。
    问：同英国领袖要讨论的主要问题是哪些？
    答：双方将讨论这次会谈的参加者所愿意提出的那些问题。事先可以说明的只有这一点：对那些直接或间接地损害到不参加苏英两国领导人会谈的国家的问题，是不会加以讨论的。要讨论的首先是关系发展我们两国贸易和扩大苏联和英国的合作的问题以及其他一些在获得解决后就会有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平的国际问题。
