Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 26th. The Preparatory Committee for the Indonesian National Constituent Assembly Meeting held its inauguration ceremony at the Independence Palace on the evening of the 25th.

    President Sukarno said at the inauguration ceremony that the purpose of establishing this committee is to enable the Constituent Assembly to achieve results as quickly as possible. He hoped that the Constituent Assembly could hold a meeting within the next few months, at the latest by August.

    Sukarno pointed out that Indonesia has not had a formal constitution since gaining independence; he hopes to be able to implement a permanent constitution drafted by the people soon.

    The committee is chaired by the Speaker of the Parliament, Sartono, and the three Deputy Speakers—Zainal Arifin, Arudji Kartawinata, and Achmad—serve as vice-chairmen.

    印度尼西亚国家制宪议会会议筹备委员会成立
    新华社雅加达26日电  印度尼西亚国家制宪议会会议筹备委员会二十五日晚上在独立宫举行成立典礼。
    苏加诺总统在主持成立典礼时说，成立这个委员会的目的在于使制宪议会尽可能迅速地取得成果。他希望制宪议会能够在今后几个月以内，最迟不过八月间举行会议。
    苏加诺指出，印度尼西亚在获得独立以后，到目前为止还没有正式的宪法；他希望能够很快实施由人民草拟的永久性的宪法。
    这个委员会由国会议长沙多诺任主席，由三位副议长——蔡纳·阿里芬、阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔和艾哈迈德任副主席。委员会的任务是就制宪议会会议的筹备事宜向政府提出建议。
