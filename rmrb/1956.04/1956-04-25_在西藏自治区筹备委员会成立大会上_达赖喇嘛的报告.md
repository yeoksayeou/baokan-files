Respected Vice Premier Chen and leaders of the Central Delegation, esteemed members and representatives:

Under the wise and correct leadership and care of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established. This is another glorious achievement of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy. It not only demonstrates the further unity within Tibet but also signifies the growing consolidation and development of unity and cooperation among the people of all brotherly ethnic groups in the motherland. This is an unprecedented and joyous event of great historical significance in the political life of the Tibetan people, and it is also a common joyous event for all ethnic groups in the motherland.

On the occasion of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Central Delegation, headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi, came to offer congratulations. We are extremely excited, and at the same time, we request Vice Premier Chen and the leaders of the Central Delegation to give us some valuable instructions and assistance.

The Tibetan ethnic group is one of the many outstanding ethnic groups in the motherland. In the glorious history of jointly building and developing the great motherland, it has fulfilled its glorious responsibilities. At the same time, in the long historical development, it has formed close ties with the people of all brotherly ethnic groups in the motherland in terms of politics, economy, and culture, thus closely linking the fate of the Tibetan people with the fate of all ethnic groups in the motherland. However, successive reactionary ruling classes implemented a policy of ethnic oppression against the Tibetan people and all ethnic groups in the motherland. In particular, the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionary government cruelly oppressed and exploited the people of all ethnic groups internally, and succumbed to imperialist aggression externally, thus greatly deepening the historically formed fears of the Tibetan people. Among them, there were also ideas and actions to break away from the big family of the motherland, leading to a estrangement between Tibet and the motherland. Since then, Tibet's politics, economy, culture, and other aspects have been in a long-term state of backwardness or even stagnation, unable to develop, and the people's lives have deteriorated, falling into poverty and suffering. Imperialists took advantage of the Tibetan people's opposition to the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionary government to carry out various kinds of deception and instigation, attempting to separate the Tibetan people from the motherland and place them under their oppression and enslavement. Especially as the mainland of the country was about to be completely liberated, the invaders intensified their efforts, frantically fabricating all kinds of sensational rumors, slandering the Communist Party, and attempting to deceive and entice the Tibetan people to resist liberation. In short, in the long years before peaceful liberation, the path taken by the Tibetan People was not only difficult but also dangerous.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government in 1949, the Central People’s Government, in line with the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), thoroughly abolished the policy of ethnic oppression, declared that all ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China are equal, and implemented unity and mutual assistance, opposing imperialism and the people's enemies within all ethnic groups, making the People's Republic of China a big family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups. Under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy, the patriotic ideology of the Tibetan people grew. In 1951, I sent representatives to Beijing to negotiate with representatives from the Central People's Government, and on the basis of unity and friendship, signed the "Agreement Between The Central Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." From then on, the Tibetan people were forever freed from the oppression and bondage of imperialism, returned to the big family of the motherland, and, like the people of all brotherly ethnic groups in the motherland, fully enjoyed all the rights of ethnic equality, and began to embark on a bright road of freedom and happiness, building their own prosperous and happy lives on the general road of building a socialist motherland.

The Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was formulated in accordance with the Chinese Communist Party's policy of ethnic equality and the specific situation and demands of Tibet at that time. It fully conformed to the interests of the Tibetan people and all ethnic groups in the motherland. It pointed out the road to liberation for the Tibetan people and is our program of action for this period. It is our sacred and glorious task to earnestly implement the various provisions of the agreement.

In the past few years, thanks to the joint efforts of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet and all the monks and laypeople of Tibet, we can say that we have achieved many major achievements in implementing the agreement.

In accordance with the provisions of the agreement, governments at all levels and the broad masses of the people in Tibet actively supported the People's Liberation Army in entering Tibet. At the end of 1951, the People's Liberation Army smoothly stationed in Lhasa and various key areas of national defense. In 1952, the Tibet Military Region was established. The People's Liberation Army and the local Tibetan troops jointly and firmly guarded the southwest national defense of the motherland.

In the past five years, the People's Liberation Army and staff members entering Tibet have conscientiously abided by and implemented the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, treated the Tibetan people with brotherly affection, listened to the people's opinions, and always considered the interests of the people. They fully consulted with local Tibetan leaders on everything. At the same time, the local Tibetan government successively sent congratulatory delegations, visiting groups, etc., to the mainland to pay tribute to their leader Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and to visit the construction of the great motherland in various places. After returning, they conveyed the strength of the motherland and the Central Government's care and concern for Tibet to the broad masses of monks, laypeople, and leaders in Tibet. As a result, the broad masses of the people in Tibet and their leaders gradually eliminated their concerns and gradually changed the distrust of the Han people that had formed historically, and began to trust the Han people. And this trust is growing day by day. At the same time, misunderstandings about the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government are gradually being eliminated.

Tibet is the center of Lamaism. All the people have a high degree of faith in Lamaism, and the people value and protect their religious beliefs as if they were their lives. In the past few years, thanks to the strict adherence to the policy of freedom of religious belief by the People's Liberation Army and staff members entering Tibet, the careful protection of Lama temples, and the respect for the beliefs of the Tibetan people, as well as the practical actions of distributing alms to the broad masses of monks and believers every year, the doubts and fears caused by the rumors and provocations of imperialist agents among the broad masses of the people, especially the lamas, have been largely dispelled. On this basis, the brotherly friendship and cooperative relations between the Han and Tibetan people have been increasingly developed and strengthened. Similarly, thanks to the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all aspects within Tibet have also united. In 1952, the Panchen Erdeni returned to Tibet and was warmly welcomed by all the people of Tibet. In accordance with the agreement, the Panchen's inherent status and functions were respected. The relationship between me, the Panchen Erdeni, and the personnel led by us has also greatly improved. The emotions of mutual suspicion and resentment formed by the provocations and alienation of successive reactionary ruling classes in the past have been reduced. Both sides have united under the glorious banner of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, and they can discuss matters with each other, understand and accommodate each other, and jointly build a new Tibet.

In the past few years, in the process of implementing the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy and the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, great achievements have also been made in developing Tibet's economic and cultural construction. With the active support and joint efforts of the People's Liberation Army and staff members entering Tibet and all monks and laypeople in Tibet, trade, banking, postal and telecommunications, and other institutions have been established in the main areas and towns of Tibet. The Tibet Trade General Company and its affiliated institutions have helped merchants expand their business turnover by contracting for goods, wholesaling domestic products, and purchasing local specialties, to a certain extent promoting the development of commerce in Tibet. In particular, the work of purchasing wool, a product of the northern pastoral areas, has greatly solved the difficulties faced by herdsmen in production and life caused by the imperialist control of wool prices. The People's Bank and its local offices provide interest-free loans to farmers and herdsmen every year and low-interest loans to handicraftsmen, solving the difficulties of some farmers, herdsmen and handicraftsmen who lack or lack agricultural tools, seeds and production funds. Many primary schools of different sizes have been established in various places, giving many Tibetan children the opportunity to study and make progress. People's hospitals have been established in Lhasa, Shigatse, Qamdo, and other major towns. At the same time, medical teams (groups) have been sent to rural and pastoral areas many times to provide free medical treatment for the broad masses of the people, reducing the suffering of many people from diseases. While carrying out the above tasks, the People's Liberation Army and staff members entering Tibet have also actively reclaimed wasteland for production, helped farmers build water conservancy projects, and established agricultural and animal husbandry experimental farms, playing a good demonstration role in improving agricultural and animal husbandry production technology, increasing output, and developing production in Tibet. These tasks were carried out under extremely difficult conditions, but the achievements were great. In general, all these tasks have laid the foundation for further developing the various construction undertakings in Tibet. It is worth mentioning in particular the issue of building roads and developing transportation. Extremely inconvenient transportation and difficult transportation were one of the biggest difficulties we encountered in carrying out various tasks in the previous period, and the People's Liberation Army and all staff members, together with the Tibetan people, did a great job in overcoming this difficulty, displaying a high degree of labor enthusiasm and self-sacrifice, and overcoming the obstruction of countless high mountains, big rivers, forests, swamps, as well as glaciers and quicksand, and opened up the Kangzang and Qingzang highways. Since then, more than 600 kilometers of highways have been successively built in Tibet from Lhasa to Shigatse, from Shigatse to Gyantse, and from Gyantse to Yadong. This has greatly changed the transportation situation between Tibet and the mainland of the motherland and within Tibet, and greatly shortened the distance between Tibet and the mainland of the motherland and between the main towns within Tibet, thus providing considerable convenience for the development of various construction undertakings in Tibet. Facts have proved that in the year or so since the highway opened, the development of various construction undertakings in Tibet has increased many times compared with the past, and prices in Tibet have begun to stabilize. The central government provided huge investments to help in the construction of highways, and we should sincerely thank them. At the same time, many people sacrificed their precious lives in the construction of roads to help Tibet change its transportation situation, and I would like to express my sincere condolences to those martyrs here.

In the past few years, the achievements made in training local Tibetan ethnic cadres and developing social education have also been remarkable. A total of six or seven hundred outstanding Tibetan and Hui young men and women have been selected and sent to the Central and Southwest Nationalities Colleges for study. Thanks to the government's care and love, these young people have been able to study with peace of mind under conditions of no worry, and therefore their academic performance is good, laying a certain foundation for further training local Tibetan ethnic cadres in the future. At the same time, the social education classes established in Lhasa and the organizations of youth and women's federations in various places have also given many young men and women and adults the opportunity to learn revolutionary knowledge, and many people have learned a lot of new knowledge. After further improvement, they are also in good condition to be trained as various cadres.

In 1952, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, the Foreign Affairs Bureau originally established by the local Tibetan government was formally merged with the Foreign Affairs Assistant Office of the Central People's Government Representative. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, thanks to the united efforts of Han and Tibetan staff, they have conscientiously implemented the foreign policy of peaceful coexistence with neighboring countries and achieved many achievements. On April 29, 1954, the delegation of the Central People's Government and delegation of the Indian government in Beijing signed the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India", making the privileges left over by the British imperialists in Tibet be cancelled. The relationship between our motherland and India in Tibet has been re-established on a new basis, which has played a significant role in establishing fair trade relations between China's Tibet region and India on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty. Due to the unification of foreign affairs and the cancellation of imperialist privileges, the southwest national defense of our country has become more consolidated.

At the same time, in the past few years, the Qamdo area, under the leadership of the higher-level people's government and the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, has done a lot of work and united very well with the Han cadres. It has achieved remarkable achievements in carrying out the construction of political, economic, and cultural aspects. Agricultural and animal husbandry production has developed to a certain extent, and ethnic cadres have grown up in large numbers and will surely have more development in the future.

In short, in the past few years since the peaceful liberation, the achievements we have made in all aspects of our work have been significant and multi-faceted, and cannot be enumerated one by one. The above-mentioned tasks we have done, as well as many other tasks, have all been carried out under the general policy of constantly opposing imperialist provocations and sabotage, strengthening patriotism, consolidating unity among ethnic groups and within ethnic groups, and consolidating the unification of the motherland. As a result of the actual education and continuous learning of various tasks, people and officials from all walks of life in Tibet have clearly realized from practice that only by always being vigilant and opposing imperialist provocations and sabotage conspiracies, striving to improve patriotic ideology, and truly strengthening and consolidating the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity, and strengthening the unity and solidarity within Tibet, can we truly do all tasks well, seek progress and development, and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet on the general road of building a socialist motherland. These are the solid material and ideological foundations for us to establish a unified Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

In 1954, I, the Panchen Erdeni, and other representatives from Tibet to the National People's Congress went to the capital - Beijing - to attend the First Session of the First National People's Congress, and together with the representatives of all brotherly ethnic groups in the country, we discussed and formulated the first people's constitution in our country's history. The Constitution clearly stipulates that ethnic regional autonomy is implemented in areas where ethnic groups live in concentrated communities. After the meeting, under the direct assistance and guidance of responsible cadres from the central government, and after repeated discussions and studies by the local government, the Panchen Kampot Council, the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, and representatives from the central government, everyone believed that according to the development of various tasks in Tibet in the past few years, it is appropriate to establish a unified Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region instead of establishing a military and political committee in Tibet, which is also in line with the spirit of the Constitution, and reached a unanimous agreement. After consulting with personnel from all aspects in Tibet, everyone reached a consensus, and then submitted a report on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region to the State Council. After discussion at the Seventh Plenary Session of the State Council, a formal decision was made. Shortly after we returned to Tibet, with the help and guidance of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Preparatory Office for the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was jointly formed by representatives from all aspects through consultation. After several months of preparation, the preparatory work in all aspects has been completed, and the Preparatory Committee has been formally established on the basis of these tasks.

Judging from the current situation, the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is not only timely but also necessary. In the past few years, the relationship within Tibet has been greatly improved, and all aspects have been consolidated and united. At the same time, all aspects of work have been developed to varying degrees. On this basis, the establishment of a unified Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, unified leadership of personnel from all aspects, and joint undertaking of some tasks, thoroughly doing a good job of unity within Tibet, so that Tibet can gradually get rid of backwardness in all aspects, catch up with advanced brotherly ethnic groups, and transition to socialist society with them, is fully in line with the current development of Tibet and in line with the long-term interests of all the people.

Recently, news of reforms being carried out or prepared for in neighboring provinces through peaceful consultation has spread to Tibet, causing some people to have doubts and fears. At the same time, some people with ulterior motives say that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tibet will carry out reforms. This is completely malicious rumor-mongering and provocation. Therefore, I would like to express some views on this issue:

Now our motherland is carrying out socialist construction in full swing, and all brotherly ethnic groups in the country are advancing on the broad road to socialism. The so-called socialism is a truly happy and beautiful society. Tibet has no other road to take except the road of socialism. However, socialism is very far away from the existing specific situation in Tibet. We must gradually carry out reforms, but when to reform? How to reform? This still depends on the development of work and the specific situation in all aspects. At the same time, it must be discussed and carried out by the leaders of Tibet and the broad masses of the people themselves, rather than being forced or taken over by others. Chairman Mao has given clear instructions on this point in his talks with successive congratulatory delegations and visiting groups. In 1954, when I and the Panchen Erdeni went to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao repeatedly instructed us that reforms must be carried out slowly and not be impatient. At the same time, he clearly told Sokang Wangqing Gele (Kaloon of the local Tibetan government) and Lhalu Tsewang Dorje (head of the 1955 Tibetan visiting group) and others from last year's visiting group that the purpose of reform is to improve everyone's lives, not to make them worse. Therefore, concerns and fears about reform are unnecessary, and there is no need to think too much about them. What we should first consider now is how to unite and actively and diligently do a good job of the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and constantly promote the work in Tibet, so that reforms can be carried out from top to bottom through peaceful consultation at an appropriate time. In terms of religion, the Constitution specifically stipulates the article on freedom of religious belief. At the same time, Chairman Mao also clearly instructed that the Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, protecting those who believe in religion and those who do not believe in religion, as well as those who believe in this religion and those who believe in other religions, and respecting their beliefs. Religion is protected today and will still be protected in the future. The basic issue of the restoration and development of religion lies in whether those who believe in religion destroy it or value and protect it as if it were their lives. It is completely different from political reform. At the same time, everyone also knows that if politics cannot develop, the development of religion is impossible. Therefore, there is no need to have doubts and fears.

According to the State Council's decision on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the tasks of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region are:

1. Gradually strengthen their responsibilities, accumulate work experience, and create various conditions so as to formally establish a unified Tibet Autonomous Region. To this end, the various departments, committees, and offices under the Preparatory Committee should be established separately and successively as needed and conditions permit, and actively carry out work, constantly summarize experience and improve work methods and methods in the work, and do the work well. While carrying out various business tasks, it is also necessary to seriously do a good job of the various specific tasks related to the establishment of a unified autonomous region.

2. Be responsible for consulting, unifying, planning, and handling construction matters in Tibet and other matters that should be handled and can be handled; make resolutions and submit them to the State Council for approval and implementation. In future work, the relevant departments should conduct thorough investigation and research work, and comprehensively consider and carefully plan the various construction matters and other matters that should be handled and can be handled. Those things that can be planned and handled in a unified manner, those that cannot be unified at present, and those things that should be and can be done and done well should be distinguished. Even if it is a matter that should be handled and can be handled, it needs to be discussed well with all relevant parties and obtain everyone's consent before proceeding, so as not to hinder work and unity.

3. Unite people from all walks of life to further strengthen unity among ethnic groups and unity within Tibet. This is an important guarantee for us to smoothly promote various tasks in the future. We must conscientiously do a good job of unity. To this end, in any work to be carried out in the future, we must fully promote democracy, repeatedly discuss with people from all walks of life, respect each other, learn from each other, help each other, and oppose mutual discrimination and even oppression, so as to obtain support and approval from all aspects in various tasks. At the same time, in order to strengthen unity among ethnic groups, we can also consider organizing visiting groups by the Preparatory Committee to visit relevant ethnic autonomous regions and autonomous prefectures, strengthen exchanges and contacts between various brotherly ethnic groups, deepen feelings, and also learn from their advanced experiences.

4. Organize and lead learning, improve cadres' anti-imperialist and patriotic awareness and policy and business levels, and actively train ethnic cadres.

5. In accordance with the provisions of the law, protect the lives and property of people of all ethnic groups and all classes in Tibet.

6. Continue to implement freedom of religious belief and protect Lama temples.

Finally, I hope that all members and all staff members will uphold the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, study hard, strengthen unity, and unite all the monks and laypeople of Tibet, always be vigilant against imperialist provocations and sabotage conspiracies, and actively complete the above-mentioned tasks under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, and with the help of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tibet Military Region, and strive to achieve regional autonomy in Tibet at an early date. My report is finished. If there is anything inappropriate, please criticize it, and please Vice Premier Chen correct it.

Long live the great unity of the people of all

    在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上
    达赖喇嘛的报告
    陈副总理及中央代表团各位首长，各位委员，各位代表：
    在中国共产党，中央人民政府和我国各族人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的英明正确领导和关怀下，西藏自治区筹备委员会成立了。这是中国共产党民族政策的又一项光辉成就。它不仅表现了西藏内部进一步的团结起来，而且标志着祖国各兄弟民族人民间团结合作的日趋巩固和发展。这是西藏人民政治生活中具有重大历史意义的空前的大喜事，也是祖国各族人民共同的一件大喜事。
    在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立的时候，以陈毅副总理为首的中央代表团前来祝贺，我们感到无比兴奋，同时我们要求陈副总理和中央代表团各首长给我们作一些宝贵的指示和帮助。
    西藏民族是祖国许多优秀民族中的一个，在共同缔造和发展伟大祖国的光荣历史的过程中，曾经尽了自己的光荣责任；同时，在长期的历史发展中，和祖国各兄弟民族人民之间从政治、经济、文化各方面形成了亲密的联系，从而使西藏人民的命运同祖国各族人民的命运紧密地联系在一起。但是，历代反动统治阶级对西藏人民和祖国各族人民均实行民族压迫政策，特别是清朝和国民党反动政府对内残酷地压迫和剥削各族人民，对外则屈服于帝国主义的侵略，于是大大加深了西藏人民从历史上形成的疑惧，其中还产生了脱离祖国大家庭的想法和行动，以致西藏与祖国的关系趋于疏远。从此之后，西藏的政治、经济、文化等都长期处于落后甚至停滞的状态，得不到发展，人民生活每况愈下，陷于贫穷痛苦的境地。而帝国主义利用西藏人民反对清朝和国民党反动政府的情绪，进行各种诱骗和挑拨，企图使西藏人民脱离祖国而处于他们的压迫和奴役之下。尤其在全国大陆将要全部解放之际，侵略者们更变本加厉，疯狂制造种种骗人听闻的谣言，污蔑共产党，企图骗诱西藏人民阻挡解放。总之在获得和平解放以前的漫长岁月里，西藏人民所走过的道路不仅是艰难的，而且是危险的。
    自从1949年中华人民共和国和中央人民政府宣布成立以后，中央人民政府依据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的规定，彻底废除了民族压迫政策，宣布中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各族人民友爱合作的大家庭。在中国共产党和毛主席伟大民族政策的感召下，西藏人民的爱国主义思想增长起来。1951年我派代表到北京与中央人民政府代表进行谈判，在团结友爱的基础上，签订了“中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”。从此，西藏人民永远摆脱了帝国主义的奴役和羁绊，回到了祖国大家庭，和祖国各兄弟民族人民一样，充分享受到了民族平等的一切权利，开始走上了自由幸福的光明大道，在建设社会主义祖国的总道路上，建设着自己的繁荣幸福的生活。
    关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，是根据中国共产党的民族平等政策和西藏当时的具体情况和要求而制定的，它完全符合于西藏人民和祖国各族人民的利益，它给西藏人民指出了争取解放的道路，是我们这一时期的行动纲领；认真执行协议的各项规定，是我们神圣的光荣的任务。
    几年来，由于进藏人民解放军和西藏全体僧俗人民的共同努力，我们在实现协议的工作中，可以说已经取得了许多重大成就。
    根据协议的规定，西藏地方各级政权和广大人民积极支援人民解放军进入西藏。1951年底人民解放军顺利地进驻拉萨及各个国防要地；1952年成立了西藏军区。人民解放军和西藏地方部队共同牢固地守卫了祖国的西南国防。
    五年来，进藏人民解放军和工作人员认真地遵守和执行了中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策，用兄弟般的情感对待藏族人民，倾听人民的意见，处处为人民的利益着想，遇事和西藏地方的领导人员充分协商。同时，西藏地方曾先后派遣了致敬团、参观团等，去祖国内地向自己的领袖毛主席和中央人民政府致敬，并去各地参观了伟大祖国各方面的建设情况，回来后向西藏广大僧俗人民传达了祖国的强大有力和中央对西藏的爱护与关怀，因而西藏广大人民及其领导人员逐渐地消除了顾虑，逐步改变着历史上形成的对汉人的不信任，开始对汉人有了信任。而这种信任关系正在日益增长着。同时，逐步消除了对中国共产党、中央人民政府的政策的误解。
    西藏是喇嘛教的中心地区，全体人民对喇嘛教都有着很高的信仰，人民对宗教信仰如同生命一样的重视和保护着。几年来，由于进藏人民解放军和工作人员严格遵守了宗教信仰自由政策，认真地保护了喇嘛寺庙，尊重藏族人民的信仰，同时每年向广大僧徒发放布施等实际行动，大大地打消了由于帝国主义特务分子造谣挑拨而在广大人民群众特别是喇嘛僧众中引起的疑惧心情。在这种基础上，汉藏民族人民兄弟般的友爱合作关系日益发展和加强起来。同样的，由于中国共产党、毛主席的领导和帮助，西藏内部各方面也团结起来了。1952年班禅额尔德尼返回西藏，受到了西藏全体人民的热烈欢迎，根据协议，尊重了班禅的固有地位和职权。我和班禅额尔德尼以及我们所领导的人员之间的关系，也有了很大的改善，由于过去历代反动统治阶级的挑拨离间而形成的互相猜疑、彼此埋怨的情绪减少了，双方在毛主席民族政策的光辉旗帜下团结起来了，并且能够互相商量办事，互谅互让共同建设新西藏。
    几年来，在贯彻中国共产党的民族政策和关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的过程中，在发展西藏的经济文化等建设事业方面，也取得了巨大的成就。进藏人民解放军和工作人员在西藏全体僧俗人民的积极支援和共同努力下，先后在西藏的各主要地区和城镇设立了贸易、银行、邮电等机构。西藏贸易总公司及其所属机构通过合同订货，批发国货，收购土特产等工作，帮助商人扩大了商业周转，在一定程度上使西藏的商业得到了发展，特别是收购北部牧区产品——羊毛工作，大大地解决了过去由于帝国主义控制羊毛压抑价格而造成的牧民在生产和生活上的困难。人民银行及其所属各地办事机构每年给农牧民发放无利贷款，给手工业者发放低利贷款，解决了部分农牧民和手工业者没有或者缺少农具、种子及生产资金的困难。各地设立了规模大小不同的许多小学校，使许多藏族儿童得到了求学上进的机会。拉萨、日喀则、昌都以及其它几个主要城镇，设立了人民医院；同时前后多次派出医疗队 （组）深入农村牧场给广大人民免费治疗疾病，使许多人减少了疾病的痛苦。在进行上述各项工作的同时，进藏人民解放军和工作人员还积极开荒生产，帮助农民兴修水利，举办农牧业试验场，为改进西藏的农牧业生产技术，提高产量，发展生产，起了良好的示范作用。这些工作都是在极端困难的条件下进行的，但取得的成绩是很大的。总的来说，这一切工作都为进一步发展西藏的各项建设事业打下了基础。这里值得特别提出的是修筑公路，发展交通事业的问题。交通极端不便，运输困难，是我们在前一时期中进行各项工作时遇到的最大的困难之一，而人民解放军和全体工作人员，与藏族人民一道，为克服这一困难进行了巨大的工作，发挥了高度的劳动热情和自我牺牲精神，战胜了无数高山、大水、森林、泥沼以及冰川、流砂的阻挡，修通了康藏、青藏两条公路，此后又在西藏境内相继修通了拉萨到日喀则，日喀则到江孜，江孜到亚东的六百多公里长的公路，这就使得西藏与祖国内地以及西藏内部的交通运输状况有了很大的改变，大大的缩短了西藏与祖国内地之间以及西藏内部各主要城镇之间的距离，从而为发展西藏的各项建设事业提供了相当大的便利条件。事实证明，自从公路通车后的一年多时间中，西藏各项建设事业的发展比过去提高了许多倍，而西藏的物价已开始走向稳定。在修筑公路中，中央曾以巨额投资给了帮助，我们应该衷心感谢。同时，有许多人为了帮助西藏改变交通状况，而在修路中献出了宝贵的生命，我在这里向那些烈士们致以衷心的悼念。
    几年来，在培养西藏本地民族干部和发展社会教育事业的工作中，所取得的成就也是显著的。前后共选送了六、七百名优秀的藏族、回族男女青年去中央和西南民族学院学习。由于政府的关怀和爱护，这些青年都能够在毫无忧虑的条件下，安心学习，因而学习成绩良好，为今后进一步培养西藏本地民族干部的工作打下了一定的基础。同时，在拉萨设立的社会教育班和各地的青年、妇女联谊会的组织，使许多男女青年和成年人也得到了学习革命知识的机会，有许多人已学到了不少的新知识。他们进一步提高之后，也是有培养成为各种干部的良好条件。
    1952年，根据协议的规定，西藏地方政府原设立的外事局与中央人民政府代表外事帮办办公室正式合并，几年来在外交部的领导下，由于汉藏工作人员团结努力，认真执行了与邻国和平相处的外交政策，取得了不少的成就。1954年4月29日我中央人民政府代表团与印度政府代表团在北京签订了“中华人民共和国、印度共和国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定”，使过去英帝国主义在西藏遗留下的特权取消，我们祖国和印度之间在西藏的关系在新的基础上重新建立起来；对我们祖国在平等互利、互相尊重主权的基础上在中国西藏地方与印度之间建立公平的通商贸易关系起了显著的作用。由于外事的统一，帝国主义特权的取消，使我国的西南国防更形巩固。
    同时，几年来，昌都地区在上级人民政府和昌都地区人民解放委员会的领导下，做了许多工作，与汉族干部团结得很好，在开展政治、经济、文化各方面的建设事业中，均取得了较显著的成就，农牧业生产已有了一定的发展，民族干部已大量的成长起来，今后必将有更多的发展。
    总之，和平解放后几年来，我们在各方面的工作中所取得的成就是显著的，多方面的，不能逐件数尽。我们所做的上述各项工作以及其他许多工作，都是在不断反对帝国主义的挑拨破坏，加强爱国主义思想，巩固民族间和民族内部的团结，巩固祖国的统一的总方针下进行的。而由于各项工作的实际教育和不断学习的结果，西藏各阶层人民和官员从实践中明确认识到只有时时刻刻警惕和反对帝国主义的挑拨破坏阴谋，努力提高爱国主义思想，确实加强和巩固祖国的统一和民族团结，加强西藏内部的统一和团结，才能真正做好各项工作，求得进步和发展，才能在建设社会主义祖国的总道路上建设起繁荣幸福的新西藏。这些也就是我们所以能够成立统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会的坚固的物质和思想基础。
    1954年我和班禅额尔德尼及西藏的其他几个全国人民代表大会代表一道去首都——北京，出席了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，和全国各兄弟民族的代表们一起讨论制定了我国历史上第一部人民的宪法。宪法中明确规定了各民族聚居地区实行民族区域自治。会后，我们又根据毛主席的指示，在中央负责干部的直接帮助指导下，经过地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会以及中央方面的代表共同多次开会，反复讨论研究的结果，大家认为根据几年来西藏各方面工作的发展情况来看，在西藏不再成立军政委员会，而成立统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会是适合时宜的，也符合宪法的精神，取得了一致的协议；又经过和在藏的各方面人员协商，大家都取得了一致意见，乃向国务院提出了关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的报告，经国务院全体会议第七次会议讨论后，做出了正式决定。我们回到西藏后不久，在中共西藏工委的帮助和指导下，经各方面协商，各派代表共同组成了西藏自治区筹备委员会筹备处，经过几个月的筹备，各方面的筹备工作业已就绪，筹委会就在这些工作的基础上正式成立。
    从现在情况看来，西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，不仅是适时的，而且是必要的。几年来，西藏内部的关系有了很大的改善，各方面已经巩固的团结起来了。同时各方面的工作均已有程度不同的发展，在这一基础上，成立统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会，统一领导各方面的人员，共同进行一些工作，彻底做好西藏内部的团结，为正式成立统一的西藏自治区，使西藏能够逐步摆脱各方面的落后状况，赶上先进的兄弟民族，而和他们一道过渡到社会主义社会，是完全符合西藏当前的发展情况和符合全体人民的长远利益的。
    最近邻居各省用和平协商的方式，正在进行或准备进行改革的消息传到了西藏，引起了若干人的疑虑和惧怕。同时有些人别有用心的说西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后，西藏就要进行改革，这完全是一种恶意造谣和挑拨。因此我想就这个问题谈一点意见：
    现在我们的祖国正在轰轰烈烈地进行着社会主义建设，全国各兄弟民族正在走向社会主义的康庄大道上前进着。所谓社会主义，是真正幸福美满的社会，西藏除了走社会主义的道路以外，别无其他道路，但是，社会主义和西藏现有的具体情况相距很远，我们必须逐步进行改革，但什么时候改革？如何改革？这还得看工作发展和各方面的具体情况，同时是要西藏的领导人员和广大人民自己商量去进行，而不是由别人强迫包办。这点在毛主席对历次致敬团、参观团的谈话中均有明确的指示。1954年我和班禅额尔德尼去北京拜见毛主席时，毛主席再三叮嘱我们改革必须慢慢地来，不能性急，同时还明确告诉过索康·旺清格勒（西藏地方政府噶伦）以及去年参观团的拉鲁·策旺多吉（1955年西藏参观团团长）等人，改革是要把大家的生活改好，而不是改坏。所以，对于改革的顾虑和惧怕是不必要的，也用不着过多的去考虑。我们现在应该首先考虑的还是如何团结一致，积极努力地把西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作做好，把西藏的工作不断的向前推进，以便在适当的时机通过和平协商的方式，自上而下的进行改革。在宗教方面，宪法中特别规定了宗教信仰自由的条文，同时，毛主席也明确指示：共产党对宗教采取保护政策，对信仰宗教和不信宗教的人，以及信这种宗教和信别种宗教的人，一律保护，并尊重他们的信仰；对宗教今天保护，将来仍然保护。宗教的恢复与发展的基本问题，在于信仰宗教的人们是否破坏它还是像生命一样的重视保护。它与政治的改革完全是两回事。同时大家也知道，政治不能发展，宗教的发展也是不可能的。因此，不需要有怀疑和恐惧。
    根据国务院关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定，西藏自治区筹备委员会的任务是：
    一、逐渐加强自己的责任，积累工作经验，创造各种条件，以便正式成立统一的西藏自治区。为此，筹委会下属的各厅、委、处应视需要和条件，分别先后成立起来，积极进行工作，在工作中不断总结经验和改进工作方式方法，把工作做好。在进行各项业务工作的同时，还必需认真做好关于成立统一的自治区的各项具体工作。
    二、负责协商统一筹划办理西藏地方的建设事宜和其他应办而又可办的事项；作出决议，报请国务院核准施行。各有关部门应在今后的工作中很好地进行调查研究工作，将各项建设事宜和其他应办而又可办的事项加以通盘考虑，详细计划，那些事情是可以统一筹划办理的，那些是目前暂不能统一的，那些事情应该而又可能办到和办好的，都应该加以区别。即如是应办而又可办的事情，也需要和各有关方面很好商量，征得大家的同意再去进行，以免妨碍工作和团结。
    三、团结各方面人士进一步加强民族间的团结和西藏内部的团结。这是我们在今后顺利推行各项工作的重要保证。我们必须认真做好团结工作。为此，在今后进行任何工作中，必须充分发扬民主，和各方面的人士反复商量，互相尊重，互相学习，互相帮助，反对互相歧视甚至压迫，以便在各项工作中，能得到各方面支持和赞助。同时为了加强民族间的团结，今后还可考虑由筹委会组织访问团，去有关民族自治区、自治州进行访问，密切各兄弟民族间的来往和联系，加深情感，同时也学习他们的先进经验。
    四、组织领导学习，提高干部的反帝爱国认识和政策业务水平，积极地培养民族干部。
    五、依照法律的规定，保护西藏各民族、各阶层人民的生命财产。
    六、继续贯彻宗教信仰自由，保护喇嘛寺庙。
    最后，我希望各位委员和所有的工作人员，一本团结互助的精神，努力学习，加强团结，并团结西藏全体僧俗人民，时刻警惕帝国主义的挑拨破坏阴谋，在中国共产党、毛主席和国务院的领导下，在中共西藏工委和西藏军区的帮助下，积极完成上述各项任务，为争取早日在西藏实行区域自治而奋斗。我的报告完了，不妥之处，请各位批评，并请陈副总理予以指正。
    中华人民共和国各民族人民大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国共产党的民族平等政策万岁！
    西藏民族内部团结万岁！
    我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
