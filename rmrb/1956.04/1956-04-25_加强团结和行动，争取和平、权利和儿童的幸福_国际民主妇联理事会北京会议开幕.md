At her suggestion, all the delegates attending the conference stood in silent tribute to the recently deceased French outstanding scientist and peace fighter, Mrs. Joliot-Curie.

Mrs. Gordon said: Ten years of experience have taught us that only through broad unity, only by uniting women of all different positions in all countries, can the cause we are committed to achieve victory.

She pointed out that the women's movement has begun a new stage. In the future, millions of women around the world should be irresistibly attracted to the great struggle to defend peace and defend life. This year's "June 1st" Children's Day should mark a new advance in the activities of the IDWF, so that the whole world understands the firm demands of mothers to oppose war and protect children.

Minella called for a more vigorous struggle to defend women's rights in political, social, labor, and life aspects. She pointed out that the IDWF warmly welcomes the upcoming World Women Workers' Conference to be held by the World Federation of Trade Unions and called for widespread publicity of the aims of this conference.
