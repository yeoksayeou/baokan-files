Opposing the United States Testing Nuclear Weapons in Trust Territories
Soviet Note to the United States
On April 18th, the Soviet Embassy in the United States delivered a note from the Soviet government to the U.S. State Department, responding to the U.S. State Department's note of February 24th regarding the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Defense conducting a series of nuclear tests on Eniwetok Island in the Trust Territory.

In the note, the Soviet government stated: The Soviet government believes that the United States' use of the Pacific Trust Territory to conduct atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, which threaten the lives and property of residents of the Trust Territory and some countries in the Pacific region, is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the international trusteeship system stipulated in the United Nations Charter. It is also incompatible with the terms of trusteeship and the responsibilities of the administering authority as stipulated in the agreements on the trusteeship of these territories, and violates important principles of international law.

Statement by the Chinese Seamen's Union
The Chinese Seamen's Union issued a statement on the 19th, protesting against the United States conducting hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific. The statement said: "The U.S. government, disregarding the opposition of people all over the world, has brazenly decided to conduct hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific after April 20th. This is an act that violates international law, threatens navigation on the high seas, and endangers the peace and security of the entire Asian and Pacific region. All Chinese seamen are extremely indignant at this act of the U.S. government which endangers the lives and safety of the people of the Pacific region and seamen of all countries. The U.S. government should respect the public opinion of millions of people in this region and immediately stop this test."

Don't Let the Bikini Tragedy Repeat Itself
Appeal from Students of Tokyo University
On the afternoon of the 20th, when the danger zone designated by the United States for hydrogen bomb testing came into effect, about 200 students from Tokyo University, Waseda University, and other schools went to the U.S. Embassy with placards reading "Don't Let the Bikini Tragedy Repeat Itself" to petition, expressing their opposition to the United States testing nuclear weapons.

The student representatives requested the representatives of the U.S. Embassy to accept a signature book with approximately 4,000 signatures of university students requesting U.S. President Eisenhower to stop nuclear weapons testing and an appeal requesting the United States to stop hydrogen bomb testing as soon as possible. However, this request was rejected by the representatives of the U.S. Embassy. The students then held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy. On the same day, the university students also petitioned the British Embassy, requesting Britain to stop conducting nuclear weapons tests in the Indian Ocean. (Xinhua News Agency)

    反对美国在托管地区试验核子武器
    苏联给美国的照会
    苏联驻美国大使馆四月十八日把苏联政府的一份照会交给美国国务院，答复美国国务院二月二十四日发出的谈到美国原子能委员会和国防部将在托管地区恩纳威托克岛进行一系列核子试验的照会。
    苏联政府在照会中说：苏联政府认为，美国利用太平洋托管地区进行使托管地区居民以及太平洋地区的一些国家的居民的生命和物质财富受到威胁的原子弹和氢弹试验，是同联合国宪章规定的国际托管制度的宗旨和原则不相容的。它同关于托管这些领土的协定所规定的托管条件和管理当局的责任也是不相容的，并且是违反了国际法的重要原则。
    中国海员工会的声明
    中国海员工会十九日发表声明，抗议美国在太平洋举行氢弹试验。声明说：“美国政府不顾全世界人民的反对，悍然决定四月二十日后在太平洋举行氢弹试验，这是违反国际公法、威胁公海航行和威胁整个亚洲及太平洋地区的和平和安全的行为。中国全体海员对于美国政府危害太平洋地区人民和各国海员生命和安全的这种行为感到十分愤慨。美国政府应尊重这个地区千百万人民的公意，立即停止这个试验。”
    不许比基尼悲剧重演
    东京大学学生的呼吁
    在美国划定的氢弹试验危险区开始生效的二十日下午，东京大学和早稻田大学等学校的学生约二百人，拿着“不许比基尼悲剧重演”的标语牌，到美国大使馆请愿，表示反对美国试验核子武器。
    学生代表们要求美国大使馆的代表接受约有四千个大学生签名的要求美国总统艾森豪威尔停止核子武器试验的签名簿和要求美国尽早停止氢弹试验的呼吁书。但是，这个要求遭到美国大使馆的代表的拒绝。学生们接着在美国大使馆门前举行了示威。当天，大学生们还到英国大使馆请愿，要求英国停止在印度洋举行核子武器试验。      （据新华社讯）
