    The International Democratic Women's Federation has been established for more than ten years. For ten years, it has called upon, organized, and inspired an increasingly wider range of women from all countries to fight tirelessly against war, to defend peace, to protect the rights of women and children, and to strive for the unity and friendship of women all over the world. Today, the influence of the International Democratic Women's Federation has extended to eighty countries, and its membership has exceeded two hundred million.
    The International Democratic Women's Federation was founded on December 1, 1945. The cruel disasters of war made millions of women hate war; at the same time, the fact that the war ended with the victory of the people of the world against Fascist aggression made them determined to do everything possible to stop new wars and believed that they could succeed as long as they were united. With this determination and confidence, representatives from forty countries, representing eighty-one million women, gathered in Paris from November 26 to December 1, 1945. They solemnly vowed to fight for the complete elimination of Fascism, to defend peace and democracy, and to protect the rights of women and children. In order to fulfill this oath, they unanimously decided to establish the International Democratic Women's Federation.
    Shortly after its establishment, the International Democratic Women's Federation took action to put into practice the desire of women of all countries to defend peace. As early as December 1946, the International Democratic Women's Federation submitted to the United Nations General Assembly a request for universal disarmament and the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons. Subsequently, it called on women of all countries to rise up against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and actively opposed the arming of West Germany and Japan, demanding an end to the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina. The International Democratic Women's Federation, together with other peace forces, actively responded to and supported the various calls and resolutions of the World Peace Council.
    The International Democratic Women's Federation is deeply concerned about the suffering and struggle of women in colonial and dependent countries. In December 1949, the first Asian Women's Representative Conference in history was held in Beijing under the organization of the International Democratic Women's Federation. The conference pointed out that the struggle of women in colonial and dependent countries for their own rights and the defense of children must be combined with the struggle for national independence and liberation.
    In conjunction with the struggle to defend peace, the International Democratic Women's Federation launched activities to defend women's rights. The "Declaration of Women's Rights" was adopted at the World Women's Congress held in Copenhagen in 1953. This declaration has become a common program for women of all countries to strive for social, political, and economic rights.
    The concern of women of all countries for human life has prompted the International Democratic Women's Federation to vigorously carry out the movement to protect children. In April 1952, the "International Conference for the Defense of Children" was convened in Vienna at the initiative of the International Democratic Women's Federation and internationally renowned figures. In July 1955, the International Democratic Women's Federation convened the World Mothers' Congress in Lausanne. This conference reflected the firm will of mothers all over the world to yearn for peace and oppose war. The conference called on mothers all over the world to unite more closely and more widely to fight for the defense of children, against war, to demand disarmament, and to strengthen the friendship between the people of all countries. The conference also decided to establish the "International Standing Committee for the Protection of Mothers and Children," so that groups and individuals who did not participate in the International Democratic Women's Federation but opposed war could cooperate with the International Democratic Women's Federation through this organization. The establishment of this organization marks a major development in the international democratic women's movement.
    On the eve of the opening of the Beijing meeting of the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation, looking back at the ten-year history of struggle of the International Democratic Women's Federation, the heroic and determined faces of hundreds of millions of women immediately appear before people. For ten years, the International Democratic Women's Federation has become a powerful force for defending peace and protecting the rights of women and children. It is believed that the convening of the Beijing meeting of the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation will help strengthen the friendly cooperation of women of all countries and the forces for defending peace. The convening of this meeting will also give encouragement and support to the growing world women's movement and the women's movements in Asia and Africa. (Xinhua News Agency)

    国际民主妇女联合会
    国际民主妇女联合会已经成立十年多了。十年来，它号召、组织和鼓舞愈来愈广泛的世界各国妇女，为反对战争、保卫和平、保卫妇女和儿童的权利，为争取全世界妇女的团结和友谊，而不疲倦地在斗争。今天，国际民主妇联的影响已经扩展到八十个国家，它的会员已经有两亿多人。
    国际民主妇联成立在1945年12月1日。战争的残酷灾害使千百万妇女痛恨战争；同时，那次战争以全世界人民反对法西斯侵略的胜利而结束这个事实，使她们决定要尽一切力量来制止新的战争，并且相信只要团结起来就能够成功。抱着这种决心和信心，代表着四十个国家、八千一百万妇女的代表于1945年11月26日到12月1日在巴黎聚会。她们庄严地宣誓，要为彻底消灭法西斯主义、保卫和平民主、保卫妇女和儿童的权利而斗争。为了履行这个誓言，她们一致决定成立国际民主妇女联合会。
    国际民主妇联成立后不久，它就用行动来实践各国妇女的保卫和平的愿望。早在1946年12月，国际民主妇联就向联合国大会提出普遍裁减军备和禁止使用原子武器的要求。随后，它又号召各国妇女起来反对北大西洋军事公约，为要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言和要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言征集签名、并且积极反对武装西德和日本、要求停止朝鲜战争和恢复印度支那的和平。国际民主妇联同其他的和平力量一起，积极响应和支持世界和平理事会的各项号召和决议。
    国际民主妇联深切关怀殖民地和附属国妇女的苦难和斗争。1949年12月，在国际民主妇联组织下，在北京举行了有史以来第一次的亚洲妇女代表会议。这次会议指出了，殖民地和附属国妇女争取自身权利和保卫儿童的斗争必须和争取民族独立、解放的斗争结合起来。
    结合着保卫和平的斗争，国际民主妇联展开了保卫妇女权利的活动。1953年在哥本哈根举行的世界妇女大会上通过了 “妇女权利宣言”。这个宣言已经成为各国妇女争取社会、政治、经济权利的共同纲领。
    各国妇女对人类生命的关怀推动了国际民主妇联大力开展了保卫儿童的运动。1952年4月，在国际民主妇联和国际知名人士倡议下在维也纳召开了“国际保卫儿童大会”。1955年7月，国际民主妇联在洛桑召开了世界母亲大会。这个大会反映了全世界母亲渴望和平、反对战争的坚决意志。大会号召全世界母亲们更紧密、更广泛地团结起来，为保卫儿童、反对战争、要求裁减军备和加强各国人民之间的友谊而斗争。大会还决定成立“国际母亲保卫儿童常设委员会”，使得那些没有参加国际民主妇联而反对战争的团体和个人可以通过这个机构来同国际民主妇联合作。这个机构的成立，标志着国际民主妇女运动的一个重大发展。
    在国际民主妇联理事会北京会议开幕的前夕，回顾一下国际民主妇联十年来斗争的历史，亿万妇女英勇、坚毅的面影立刻呈现在人们面前。十年来，国际民主妇联已经成为保卫和平、保卫妇女和儿童的权利的一支强大的力量。人们相信，国际民主妇联理事会北京会议的召开，将有助于加强各国妇女的友好合作和保卫和平的力量。这次会议的召开对日益发展的世界妇女运动和亚洲、非洲的妇女运动，也将给予鼓舞和支持。（新华社）
