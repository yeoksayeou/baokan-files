    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 15th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Secretaries-General of both sides of the Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on April 14th. The Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side exposed the lies of the US regarding the so-called "violations of the armistice agreement by the Korean-Chinese side." The US insisted that armed personnel from the Korean-Chinese side had crossed the military demarcation line at dawn on April 10th, "invaded" the US's demilitarized zone, and launched a "sudden attack" on a US military police post.

    The Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side listed a series of facts clearly established in the joint investigation records and in the special report of the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Third Joint Observer Team, and resolutely refuted the US claims.

    The Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that the purpose of this slander by the US is to cover up its crimes of continually violating the armistice agreement and engaging in hostile activities against the Korean-Chinese side since the armistice.

    The Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side said that today the public fully understands that the Korean-Chinese side has always strictly abided by the armistice agreement and various agreements between the two sides since the armistice. People all over the world also fully understand that since the armistice, the US has dispatched its armed personnel twenty-two times to sneak into the demilitarized zone of the Korean-Chinese side and the areas under the military control of the Korean-Chinese side to carry out armed attacks and other provocative hostile activities, and has blatantly violated the armistice agreement more than five hundred and several times by sending various combat aircraft to invade our airspace for hostile activities. No fabrication or slander by the US can whitewash or obliterate these ironclad facts.

    美方不断违反朝鲜停战协定反诬我方越界
    朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面秘书长揭穿美方诽谤谎言
    据新华社平壤15日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会双方秘书长四月十四日举行会议。朝中方面秘书长在会上揭穿了美方提出的所谓朝中方面“违反停战协定的事件”的谎言。美方硬说朝中方面武装人员曾在四月十日黎明越过军事分界线“侵入”美方的非军事区，并且对美方的一个民警岗哨发动了“突然的袭击”。
    朝中方面秘书长列举了经过联合调查的记录和第三联合观察小组朝中方面首席组员在特别报告中所清楚确定的一系列事实，坚决驳斥了美方的说法。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，美方这种诽谤的目的是要掩盖它自停战以来不断违反停战协定对朝中方面进行敌对活动的罪行。
    朝中方面秘书长说，今天公众完全了解朝中方面一直严格遵守停战协定和停战以来双方之间的各种协议。全世界人民也完全了解，自从停战以来，美方曾经有二十二次派遣它的武装人员潜入朝中方面的非军事区以及在朝中方面军事控制下的地区来进行武装攻击和其他挑衅性的敌对活动，同时曾经有五百零几次悍然违反停战协定派各种作战飞机侵入我方领空进行敌对活动。美方的任何捏造或诽谤都不能粉饰或抹杀这些铁的事实。
