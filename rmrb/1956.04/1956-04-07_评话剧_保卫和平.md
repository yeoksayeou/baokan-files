Review of the Play "Defend Peace"
By Chen Qitong

Playwright: Song Zhidi; Director: Liu Jia; Performed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Soldiers' Drama Troupe

The play "Defend Peace" exposes the crimes of the American aggressors in creating war in Korea, praises the just war of the Korean and Chinese peoples, and extols the earth-shattering and tear-jerking heroic spirit of the Korean and Chinese soldiers. It is one of the most popular plays in this drama festival.

The playwright chose the solemn words "Defend Peace" as the title of the play, showing the essence of this great struggle. "Peace" is the most ominous word in the eyes of the warmongers, who are forced to sit down for peace talks while plotting to undermine it. Based on the complex and dangerous situation on the Korean battlefield at that time, the playwright of "Defend Peace" unfolds the dramatic plot of the play. The author, Song Zhidi, exposes the enemy's peace conspiracy with fiery political enthusiasm. The play writes about those extraordinary days from June to July 1953. At that time, the enemy was negotiating at Panmunjom on one hand, and preparing to attack with two American divisions, one airborne regiment, one howitzer battalion, and one capital division of Li Chengwan, attempting to wipe out the main force of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in one fell swoop. However, the Korean and Chinese People's troops saw through the enemy's conspiracy and launched a fierce offensive against the enemy two hours before they were ready to attack, breaking through the enemy's so-called unbreakable Missouri Line like lightning. The warmongers at the Panmunjom talks had to sign the armistice agreement as they watched the corpses of their comrades and the groups of prisoners escorted by the Korean and Chinese troops. The Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers extinguished the flames of war with their blood.

The author portrays a group of heroic figures of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army with magnificent poetic emotion, shaping the images of three commanders and fighters of the Volunteers, Li Guodong, Cui Kai, and Ding Dayong.

Li Guodong is a division commander of the Volunteers. He appears on the scene by the riverbank with torrential rain and turbulent waves. At the beginning, the author places him at the forefront of the contradiction: the superior orders him to rush to the Jincheng front line in two days and two nights, but in front of him is a flash flood that has washed away the only river bridge. Li Guodong, this calm and resolute commander, leads everyone to cross the river with galloping horses and turbulent waves by climbing ropes. Until the end of the play, we can see that he embodies the invincible power of the people's army. As he said to the soldier Ding Dayong: "Whenever I am in the most difficult time, I can draw strength from you, from you! ... What heroic people we have!" He loves his comrades and cares about the love of Deputy Regiment Commander Cui Kai. When he looks at the photo of the female foreman, he praises, "Our working class is so energetic"; when he discovers that the soldier Ding Dayong is the son of his old comrade who died twenty years ago, he says excitedly, "The working people are stronger from generation to generation"; these detailed descriptions make us strongly feel his sincere and heroic socialist feelings.

The author portrays Cui Kai, the deputy regimental commander, as a vibrant and heroic middle-level commander. He is so naive when the division commander asks him to show the photo of his lover, but he is so brave and strong when he is ordered to lead his troops to penetrate the enemy's heart. When he finally holds Yingfeng and fights hard in a bloody battle, he knows that he has suffered a fatal injury, but he still smiles to comfort and encourage the radio operator who has been blinded by the blast. Here, the playwright cleverly uses romantic techniques to describe Cui Kai's monologue before his sacrifice, allowing us to hear the voice from the bottom of the heart of a hero and a Communist Party member: "The Party trusts you, this is your honor. What, are you going to swallow this breath? Who will you hand over your unfinished responsibility to? This young member of the Youth League has his eyes damaged and cannot see anything for the time being, but he has seen our red flag, and he has seen the red flag fluttering, fluttering..." This is a scene that shocks the audience's hearts.

The author also creates an image of a brave and optimistic soldier, Ding Dayong. In the face of such a lively and vigorous young soldier, all difficulties will pale in comparison. His foot is injured, and he refuses to take the rubber shoes given to him by the squad leader, saying, "I don't want to spoil it." In front of his superiors and comrades, he is like a naive and simple child, but in front of the enemy, he is an invincible little tiger.

The author also uses lyrical brushstrokes to describe the Korean people's girls - the two Chunxiangs - Yoon Chunxiang and Kim Chunxiang. Through Yoon Chunxiang, he reflects the courageous work of the Korean People's Army within the enemy; through Kim Chunxiang, he portrays the Korean people's meticulous care and love for the Volunteers. The description of Kim Il-woo is also very successful. In front of the enemy, he not only shows the heroic spirit of the Korean People's Army, but also shows the integrity of a labor party member. Anyone who has been to Korea will feel the kind of courage of Kim Il-woo and Yoon Chunxiang and Kim Chunxiang everywhere. I have visited the girls who carried the wounded down from the front line and the old people who led the yellow cattle to deliver grain to the front. They told me: "If anyone wants to bully us, we will carry out the famous saying left by the heroes of the past: "It is a thousand times better to die bravely than to live in humiliation." This is the invincible heroic spirit that the Korean people have always shown in the face of aggressors. The playwright expresses the Korean people's loyal and unyielding spirit in these characters.

In addition, we also greatly appreciate the author's skill in describing the enemy. He makes me clearly see the brutal face of Bai Changpu, the commander of the White Tiger Regiment of the Li puppet army's capital division, the arrogant murderer, American Colonel Smith, and those degenerate goods who only chew gum.

In addition to portraying the above-mentioned vivid characters, the greatest success of "Defend Peace" lies in its magnificent heroic spirit that runs through the entire play. If we can borrow the verses sung by Wen Tianxiang in "Song of Righteousness," it is "This spirit is so magnificent that it will exist forever. When it penetrates the sun and the moon, how can life and death be considered?" From the first scene when Kim Il-woo is captured and walks into the headquarters of the White Tiger Regiment of the Li puppet capital division, and Yoon Chunxiang's teacup falls to the ground, the audience's mood can no longer be calm, and they are constantly worried about the fate of the heroes from this moment on. In the second scene, there is a thunderstorm and a torrential river. The soldiers of the Volunteers are marching in the dark of night amidst wind and rain. It seems that nothing can stop them from advancing. The third scene describes the preparations before the battle, the fourth scene describes the enemy's conspiracy being thwarted, the fifth scene describes the scene of bidding farewell to the troops going to infiltrate, the sixth scene describes breaking through the enemy's positions, the seventh scene describes the dagger of the infiltrating troops being inserted into the enemy's chest, and the eighth scene describes the heroes of the Volunteers stubbornly holding Yingfeng. The last scene falls on Yingfeng, where the red flag is flying after the signing of the armistice agreement in Panmunjom. The layout of these four acts and eight scenes is truly coherent. The author's lyrical brushstrokes and optimistic mood always reveal a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere of life from those solemn moments. "Defend Peace" is a new achievement of our playwrights in writing about military struggle life.

From the perspective of the script, "Defend Peace" also has some shortcomings. The images of Li Guodong, Cui Kai, and Ding Dayong can be more prominent, especially Li Guodong, who still lacks strong actions; Yoon Chunxiang's personality is not consistent before and after, and the division political commissar Fang Ping lacks the continuity of the dramatic plot; the political terms forcibly added to the characters' mouths are also a bit too much, appearing a bit stiff, and some places still lack a strong atmosphere of life. This has to cause some losses to the fullness of the ideological content and the integrity of the art of this play.

    评话剧“保卫和平”
    陈其通
    作剧：宋之的　导演：刘佳　中国人民解放军战士话剧团演出
    话剧“保卫和平”揭露了美国侵略者在朝鲜制造战争的罪恶，歌颂了朝中人民的正义战争，歌颂了朝中人民战士们的惊天地、泣鬼神的英雄气概。这是此次话剧会演中受欢迎的剧目之一。
    剧作家选择了“保卫和平”这个庄严的字眼作为剧本的名字，显示了这场伟大斗争的本质。“和平”，在战争贩子们看来是最不吉祥的字眼，他们一边被迫坐下来进行和平谈判，一边制造阴谋来破坏它。“保卫和平”的剧作者根据朝鲜战场当时这样复杂而又险恶的情况，展开了剧本的戏剧性的情节。作者宋之的以火一般的政治热情揭露了敌人的和平阴谋。这个剧写到了1953年六月至七月那些非凡的日子。那时候敌人一面在板门店进行谈判，一面却以两个美军师，一个空降团，一个榴炮营和李承晚的一个首都师准备进攻，想一举歼灭朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的主力。可是朝中人民部队识破了敌人的阴谋，在敌人准备进攻的前两个钟头，就先向敌人展开了猛烈的攻势，像闪电一般地突破了敌人吹嘘的不可攻破的米苏里防线。在板门店谈判的好战者望着他们同伴的尸体和被朝中军队押解着的俘虏群，不得不在停战书上签了字。朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军用鲜血把战火扑灭了。
    作者以磅礴的诗情描绘了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的一群英雄人物，塑造了志愿军三个指战员李国栋、崔恺、丁大勇的形象。
    李国栋是志愿军的一个师长，他在狂风暴雨、浪涛汹涌的江边出场，作者一开始就把他安排在矛盾的尖端：上级命令限两天两夜赶到金城前线，而面前却是山洪暴涨，冲垮了唯一的江桥。李国栋，这位沉着、坚毅的指挥员，带着大家攀着绳子，渡过了万马奔腾、波浪滔天的江水。一直到戏的结束，我们都能看到他集中地体现了人民军队的不可战胜的力量，正如他对战士丁大勇所说的：“每当我在最困难的时候，我都能在你、在你们身上，汲取到力量！……我们有什么样的英雄的人民呐！”他热爱他的同志们，关心副团长崔恺的爱情，当他看着那位女工长的照片的时候，他称赞道，“咱们工人阶级，都这么有精神”；当他发现战士丁大勇就是他二十年前死去的老战友的儿子的时候，他激昂地说道，“劳动人民，一代强似一代”；这些细节的描写，使我们强烈地感染到他的诚挚、豪迈的社会主义感情。
    作者在副团长崔恺身上刻划了一个朝气蓬勃、英姿焕发的中级指挥员的形象。在师长要他拿出爱人的照片时，他是那么天真，而当他奉令带着部队穿插到敌人心脏地带去的时候，却是那么勇敢和坚强。当他最后固守鹰峰、浴血苦战的时候，他明知道自己受了致命的创伤，还微笑着去安慰、鼓舞身边被炸瞎了双眼的报话员。剧作者在这里巧妙地运用了浪漫主义的手法，描写崔恺在牺牲前说了一段独白，让我们能听到一个英雄、一个共产党员心底的声音：“党信任你，这是你的荣誉。怎么，要咽下这口气吗？你未了的责任交给谁？这个青年团员的眼打坏了，暂时什么都看不到了，但他却看到了我们的红旗，看见了红旗飘哇，飘哇………”这是震撼观众心灵的场面。
    作者还创造了丁大勇这样一个勇敢、乐观的战士形象。在这样生龙活虎的年青战士面前，一切困难都会黯然失色。他的脚摔伤了，不肯要班长给他的胶鞋，说“还把它惯坏了呢”。他在上级和同志们面前，像个天真、淳朴的孩子，而在敌人面前，却又是不可战胜的小老虎。
    作者还用抒情的笔调描写了朝鲜人民的少女——南北两春香——尹春香和金春香。通过尹春香反映朝鲜人民军在敌人内部进行的勇敢的工作；通过金春香刻划出朝鲜人民对志愿军无微不至的关怀和爱戴。对于金一禹的描写也是十分成功的，他在敌人面前不仅是表现了朝鲜人民军的英雄气概，而且表现了劳动党员的气节。到过朝鲜的人，无论在什么地方都会感到金一禹们和尹春香、金春香们的这种刚气。我访问过从前线抬伤员下来的少女们和牵着黄牛向前方送粮的老年人们，他们告诉我：“如果有人要欺负我们，我们就执行着历代英雄们留下的名言：“英勇地战死比受辱地活着强千倍。”这是朝鲜人民在侵略者面前历来所表现的不可战胜的英雄气概，剧作者把朝鲜人民这种赤胆忠心、不屈不挠的气概表现在这几个人物身上了。
    此外，我们也十分赞赏作者善于描写敌人，他使我清楚地看到李伪军首都师白虎团团长白昌朴那付残暴成性的嘴脸，看到美军上校史密斯那个趾高气扬的杀人犯，还有那些只会嚼口香糖的堕落货。
    除了刻划了上述的一些鲜明的人物形象之外，“保卫和平”最大的成功处，还在于它的贯穿全剧的气壮山河的英雄气概，如果可以借用文天祥在“正气歌”里所歌颂的诗句，就是“是气所磅礴，凛烈万古存，当其贯日月，生死安足论”。从第一场金一禹被俘走进李伪首都师白虎团团部、尹春香的茶杯落地的时候开始，观众的心情就再也不能平静了，从此时时刻刻为英雄们的命运耽心。第二场，雷雨大作，江洪滔滔，志愿军的战士们在风雨交加的深夜里行进，似乎没有什么东西能够阻止他们前进。第三场描写搏斗之前的准备，第四场描写敌人的阴谋受挫，第五场描写欢送穿插部队誓师的情景，第六场描写突破敌军阵地，第七场描写穿插部队的尖刀插在敌人的胸膛，第八场描写志愿军的英雄们顽强的守住了鹰峰。最后幕落在板门店停战协定签字后、红旗飘扬的鹰峰上。这四幕八场戏的布局，真是一气呵成。作者那些抒情的笔调，乐观主义心情，随时都从那些庄严的时刻里透露出使人轻松愉快的生活气息。“保卫和平”是我们戏剧作家写军事斗争生活的新收获。
    “保卫和平”从剧本上看，也还有一些缺陷。李国栋、崔恺、丁大勇的形象，还可以更加突出一些，特别是李国栋，还缺乏有力的行动；尹春香的性格前后不够统一，师政治委员方平缺乏戏剧情节的连贯；硬加在人物嘴边的政治术语也还多了一些，显得有些生硬，有些地方也还显得生活的气息不够浓。这就不得不使得这个剧在思想内容的丰满和艺术的完整上受到一些损失。
