Blocking Rivers and Canals to Divert Water for Irrigation
    Guangdong People Launch Drought Resistance Campaign

    Several million farmers in Guangdong Province are currently engaged in the struggle to resist drought and rush to transplant rice seedlings. In the plains, the universal practice is to block rivers and canals to divert water for irrigation; in the hilly areas, a large-scale well-digging campaign is underway. In the Zhanjiang Special District, relatively large rivers such as the Jianjiang, Shalangjiang, Jiuzhoujiang, and Meihua River have all been blocked by farmers. Xinxing County, which is experiencing a particularly severe drought, blocked eight large rivers and more than three hundred small rivers in ten days, and also dug more than three hundred wells; now more than 75% of the early rice fields in the county have been transplanted. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee recently formed eight work groups and sent them to various special districts to inspect and promote local drought resistance and rush transplanting work. The Agricultural Bank of Guangdong Province has also allocated an additional one million yuan in loans to support farmers in drought resistance. In areas severely affected by drought, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed there have suspended drills for three to five days to help farmers resist drought and rush to transplant rice seedlings. Currently, more than six million mu of rice seedlings have been transplanted throughout the province, and the struggle to resist drought and rush to transplant is continuing to unfold in depth.

    封江堵河引水灌田
    广东人民展开抗旱运动
    广东省目前有几百万农民投入了抗旱抢插的斗争。在平原地区，普遍实行封江堵河，引水灌田；在丘陵地带，正在开展大规模的挖井运动。湛江专区境内的鉴江、沙琅江、九洲江和袂花河等比较大的河流，都已经被农民拦截起来。受旱比较严重的新兴县，在十天中就堵截了八条大河，三百多条小河，还挖了三百多个水井；现在全县75％以上的早造稻田已经插下了秧。中共广东省委员会和广东省人民委员会最近组成了八个工作组，分赴各专区检查和推动各地抗旱抢插工作。广东省农业银行也增拨了一百万元贷款支援农民抗旱。在旱情严重的地区，驻在当地的人民解放军部队，停止操课三天至五天，帮助农民抗旱抢插。现在全省已经插秧六百多万亩，抗旱抢插斗争正继续深入展开。
