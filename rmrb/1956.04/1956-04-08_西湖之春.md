Spring has arrived at West Lake. The weeping willows and peach blossoms surrounding the lake adorn it with extraordinary splendor. West Lake is welcoming working people who come here for vacation.

In the early morning of April, when the morning mist still shrouds West Lake, goose-yellow buses arrive at Hangzhou Railway Station and Qiantang River Wharf, continuously transporting spring tourists to Broken Bridge, Autumn Moon over the Peaceful Lake, Xiling Apricot Garden; to the Fish Paradise and Yellow Dragon Cave with their clear waves; to the Yue Fei Temple and Lingyin Temple, with their ancient towering cypress trees, and other scenic spots. In the evening, the quiet lake water is rippled by the breeze, and tourists sit in small boats, enjoying the evening breeze as they drift in the heart of the lake.

This year, West Lake is even more gorgeously dressed with flowers. Two million three hundred thousand saplings have been newly planted around the lake, and the scenic routes from Lingyin to Tianzhu and from Qingbo Gate to Yuhuang Mountain have been greened. The South Peak, North Peak, Sunset Hill, and Phoenix Mountain surrounding the lake are all covered in green. Near Willow Wave Listening to Orioles, a new park-like children's sports field has been opened, equipped with more than forty kinds of sports game equipment. The People's Square newly built in front of Zhaoxing Temple is now decorated with dragon cypress, cloud pine, palm trees, crepe myrtle and other plants, all lush and green. In the Su Causeway, Bai Causeway, and Gushan, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Lake Heart Pavilion and other tourist areas crisscrossing the lake, exotic flowers are in full bloom.

Hospitable Hangzhou has recently received more than 50,000 tourists from all over the country. The eighteen sanatoriums and seven trade union amateur rest homes distributed along the banks of West Lake have been opened, and these sanatoriums can accommodate more than 3,000 people at the same time. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions recently built a new sanatorium in Pingfeng Mountain, Jiuxi, which has welcomed 987 advanced producers to rest here this spring. (Attached picture)

Springtime in West Lake is when peach and plum trees are vying to bloom. The beautiful scenery attracts students from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other cities to spend their spring break here. The picture shows students on the Bai Causeway, where peach blossoms are in full bloom.

    西湖之春
    本报记者　屠正峰
    春天已经降临到西湖。环绕西湖的垂柳和桃花，把全湖点缀得分外艳丽。西湖正迎接前来休假的劳动人民。
    四月的早晨，当晨雾还笼罩着西湖的时候，鹅黄色的公共汽车就到杭州车站、钱塘江码头，把游春的人们源源接送到断桥、平湖秋月、西冷杏花园；送到清波碧水的鱼乐国、黄龙洞；送到古柏参天的岳王坟、灵隐寺等风景区。傍晚，静静的湖水被微风吹起片片鳞波、游人坐着小舟迎着晚风在湖心荡漾。
    今年，西湖更加花团锦簇地盛装起来了。在湖的四周新种植了二百三十万株苗木，灵隐至天竺、清波门至玉皇山风景线上已经绿化。环湖的南高峰、北高峰、夕照山和凤凰山等都披上了绿衣。在柳浪闻莺近邻，新辟了一座公园式的儿童体育场，这里设备了四十多种体育游戏器具。昭庆寺前新建的一座人民广场，现在也被龙柏、云松、棕榈、紫薇等装饰得一片葱绿。纵横湖中的苏堤、白堤和孤山、三潭印月、湖心亭等游览区奇花怒放。
    好客的杭州近日来已接待了从全国各地来的五万多游人。分布在西子湖畔的十八个疗养院和七个职工业余休养所已经开放，这些疗养机构可以同时容纳三千多人。上海市工会联合会不久前在九溪屏风山新建的一座疗养院，今春已接纳了987个先进生产者来这里休憩。（附图片）
    春天的西湖，正是桃李争开的时候。秀丽的景色吸引着上海、杭州等城市来这里欢度春假的学生们。图为学生们在桃花盛开的白堤上。
