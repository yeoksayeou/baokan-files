    新华社1日讯　中华人民共和国国防部公报：按照中华人民共和国兵役法规定进行的1955年度兵员征集工作，在全国人民的热烈支持下，已按期圆满地完成。同时，中国人民解放军原自愿参军的士兵中应该在1955年度复员的人员，已全部实行复员，现正纷纷走上生产建设岗位。
    据新华社1日讯　1955年度的兵员征集工作和军人复员工作已经按期完成。这次兵役登记和征集工作是从1955年11月开始的。在过去几个月中，广大适龄青年都踊跃登记和应征。从十八岁到二十岁的男性公民进行兵役登记的，在吉林省就达到99％，在上海、天津两市达到91％以上。因此，1955年度的兵员征集任务在很短的时间内便顺利完成了。
    在1955年度复员的中国人民解放军士兵，将有十多万人参加地质和石油勘探工作，以及电力、冶金、煤矿等工业基本建设。另有几十万人将参加管理农村的发电站、抽水机，充当拖拉机手、卫生员和电话员。
