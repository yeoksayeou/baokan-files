    Do Not Plant Chinese Locust Trees Near Cotton Fields
    To the Editor:
    Currently, North and Northwest China are carrying out afforestation work. The Chinese locust tree is one of the tree species used for afforestation in these areas. It is an excellent tree species for preventing wind and fixing sand, improving soil, and preventing erosion. However, it is not suitable as a tree species for field protection forest belts to be planted near cotton fields. This is because if cotton fields are infested with cotton aphids, the cotton aphids can easily migrate to the Chinese locust trees to reproduce and breed, which will affect the growth of the Chinese locust trees and also affect the plan to eliminate cotton aphids within five years. Therefore, I suggest that all regions do not plant Chinese locust trees near cotton fields during afforestation.

    不要在棉田附近种洋槐编辑同志：
    目前华北和西北地区正在开展植树造林工作。洋槐是这些地区造林树种之一，它是防风固沙、改良土壤、防止侵蚀的优良树种。但是，它不适于作为护田林带的树种，种在棉田附近。因为如果棉田发生了棉蚜虫害，棉蚜很容易迁移到洋槐上面去繁殖、滋生，既影响了洋槐的生长，也影响了五年内消灭棉蚜的计划。所以，我建议各地在造林的时候不要在棉田附近种植洋槐。　林护
