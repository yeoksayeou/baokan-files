    During their stay in China, A.I. Mikoyan and Sh.R. Rashidov visited Hankou, toured some of the construction projects underway in the city, and learned about the economic and cultural achievements of the People's Republic of China.
    In Beijing, A.I. Mikoyan and Sh.R. Rashidov held talks with Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Vice Premiers Chen Yun, Peng Dehuai, Deng Xiaoping, Deng Zihui, He Long, Ulanhu, Li Fuchun, and Li Xiannian, Ministers of the People's Republic of China, and other leaders. During the talks, friendly exchanges of views were held on issues concerning Sino-Soviet relations and other issues involving the interests of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.
    During their stay in Beijing, the Soviet Government Delegation continued negotiations with the Government of the People's Republic of China, which had begun earlier in Moscow, on the issue of further developing economic cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. As a result of these negotiations, which were conducted in an atmosphere of sincere friendship and full mutual understanding, the two sides reached an agreement and signed the following two agreements.
    One is the Agreement on Soviet Assistance to the People's Republic of China in Developing Certain Industrial Sectors, which provides for the construction of fifty-five new industrial enterprises as a supplement to the one hundred and fifty-six projects currently under construction under previous Sino-Soviet agreements.
    Among the aforementioned fifty-five enterprises are metallurgical plants, machine-building plants, chemical plants (producing man-made fibers and gelatinous materials), enterprises in the electrical technology and radio technology industries, plants producing artificial liquid fuels, power stations, and scientific research institutions for the aviation industry. The equipment supplied, the design work provided, and other types of technical assistance provided by the Soviet side for the establishment of the above-mentioned fifty-five enterprises are worth approximately 2.5 billion rubles in total. The Chinese government will pay this cost through trade procedures. The agreement also provides for expanding assistance to China in geological work.
