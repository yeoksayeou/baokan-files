    Higher Normal School Teaching Experience Exchange Conference Closes
    The Higher Normal School Teaching Experience Exchange Conference closed on the 17th.
    A total of forty experience reports were discussed at this exchange conference. Through discussion, the representatives further clarified that higher normal education must pay great attention to understanding the actual situation of secondary school teaching, conduct necessary scientific research on the problems existing in secondary education, and improve the teaching quality of higher normal education. It was recognized that higher normal schools massively running both formal and informal correspondence education is a major task to meet the country's urgent need for secondary school teachers, and informal correspondence education should gradually transition to formal correspondence education. They believe that, based on the experience already gained by some schools, using vacations to concentrate correspondence students for study is a practical and effective measure to ensure the quality of correspondence education.
    The exchange conference studied the issues of how to regularize educational practice and improve the quality of practice.
    At the experience exchange conference, Soviet experts provided comprehensive answers to more than two hundred questions raised by the representatives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    高等师范学校教学经验交流会闭幕
    高等师范学校教学经验交流会十七日闭幕。
    这次交流会共讨论了四十个经验报告。经过讨论，代表们进一步明确认识到：高等师范教育必须十分重视了解中学教学实际，对中学教育中存在的问题进行必要的科学研究，提高高等师范教育的教学质量。认识到高等师范学校大量举办正规的和不正规的函授教育是适应国家对中学教师迫切需要的重大任务，不正规的函授教育应该逐步向正规函授教育过渡。他们认为，根据某些学校已经取得的经验，利用假期集中函授生学习是保证函授教育质量的切实可行的有效措施。
    交流会对教育实习如何经常化和提高实习质量的问题进行了研究。
    在经验交流会上，苏联专家对代表们提出的二百多个问题作了综合解答。　（新华社）
