	After a spring rain, spring plowing and sowing work in the fertile Hexi Corridor (Zhangye Special District, Gansu Province), from Wushaoling in the east to Yangguan in Dunhuang in the west, has become even busier. This year, the Hexi Corridor will expand the planting area for grain by one million mu, increasing grain production by 800 million jin through increasing yield per unit area and reclaiming wasteland. The cotton field area will be more than double that of last year, and the total output will increase by about four times. In order to complete this production increase task, farmers launched a campaign to accumulate fertilizer with thousands of carts and ten thousands of loads last winter and this spring. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu of wheat this year has generally increased by one-third to one time compared to before the collectivization. Many lands that were not fertilized in the past are now fertilized. Seed treatment has also been greatly improved compared to the past. Cotton seeds have basically undergone grain selection, and many places have promoted seed dressing with chemicals. Water conservancy projects and mass small-scale water conservancy projects and field projects were started successively as early as the winter freeze period. Before and after the spring plowing, a large amount of wasteland was also reclaimed in various places. According to statistics from 229 townships, more than 280,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. (Our correspondent stationed in Lanzhou)

    河西走廊扩大播种面积
    一场春雨后，在富饶的河西走廊（甘肃省张掖专区），东起乌鞘岭，西到敦煌阳关，春耕播种工作显得更为忙碌了。河西走廊今年要扩大粮食播种面积一百万亩，从提高单位面积产量和开垦荒地等方面增产八亿斤粮食。棉田面积要较去年增加二倍多，总产量要增加四倍左右。农民们为了完成这一增产任务，在去冬今春便展开了千车万担的积肥运动。今年小麦每亩地施肥的数量，比合作化之前一般都增加了三分之一到一倍。许多不施肥的土地也都施了肥。种子处理上也较过去有很大改进。棉籽基本上进行了粒选，很多地方推行了药剂拌种。水利工程和群众性的小型水利工程及田间工程，早在冬季封冻时期就陆续开工。在春耕前后，各地还开垦了大量荒地。据229个乡统计，已经开出荒地二十八万多亩。（本报驻兰州记者）
