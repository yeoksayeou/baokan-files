Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: In the past hundred days, twenty-nine factories and mines in Beijing have promoted over one hundred and eighty advanced experiences from fraternal factories in various regions.

    The Shijingshan Power Plant, drawing on the advanced experiences provided by power plants in Shanghai, Fushun, and other places, has formulated eighty-six new technology plans that will enable various economic indicators to exceed the 1957 levels this year. After implementing the safe power generation experience of the Tangshan Power Plant, the power department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has transformed from a weak department in the factory's production to an advanced unit. After the coking department of this plant implemented fourteen advanced experiences from the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's coking department, the coke breeze rate was reduced by more than 1%, which can increase the country's coke production by four thousand tons per year. After the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory promoted the experience of the Kaifeng Farm Implement Factory, the reject rate of the double-wheel double-share plow moldboard dropped from 28% in the fourth quarter of last year to only about 2%.

    The promotion of these advanced experiences has shattered the conservative thinking and complacency of some leading cadres and workers. When the workers in the coking department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant initially heard that the coke breeze rate of the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant was lower than theirs, they did not believe it. The representatives sent to visit and learn on-site personally checked the forms and reports and weighed the materials. However, everything confirmed that the other party was indeed advanced. The leading cadres of the Shijingshan Power Plant, who had always believed that their factory's production had reached its peak for several years, unexpectedly discovered that there was great potential to be tapped within their factory after sending people to study in Tianjin, Tangshan, and other places, and after factories in Shanghai, Fushun, and other places sent people to the factory to introduce advanced experiences.

    北京市二十九个厂矿企业
    一百天内推广一百八十多项先进经验
    新华社13日讯　北京市二十九个厂矿企业在最近一百天中推广了各地兄弟厂的一百八十多项先进经验。
    石景山发电厂参照上海、抚顺等地发电厂提供的先进经验，订出了能使今年各种经济指标超过1957年水平的八十六项新技术方案。石景山钢铁厂动力部推行唐山发电厂安全发电的经验以后，由全厂内生产上薄弱部门变成了先进单位。这个厂的炼焦部推行了石家庄焦厂和太原钢铁厂炼焦部的十四项先进经验以后，使焦末率降低了1％多，一年可为国家增产四千吨焦炭。北京农业机械厂推广开封农具厂的经验后，双轮双铧犁犁镜的废品率由去年第四季的28％降到只有2％左右。
    这些先进经验的推行，打破了部分领导干部和职工的保守思想和自满情绪。石景山钢铁厂炼焦部职工原先听说石家庄焦厂焦末率比他们低，都不相信，派去的代表在实地参观学习的时候，还亲自查看表报和过秤。但一切都证实了人家的确先进。几年来一直认为自己工厂生产到顶了的石景山发电厂的领导干部，在派人到天津、唐山等地学习，并且经过上海、抚顺等厂派人来厂介绍先进经验以后，才出乎意料地发现自己厂内大有潜力可挖。
