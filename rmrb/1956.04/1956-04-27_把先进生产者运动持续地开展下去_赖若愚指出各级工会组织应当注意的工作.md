Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch. Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke to a reporter from this agency today about the current situation of the Advanced Producer Movement in various parts of the country.

Lai Ruoyu said that the Advanced Producer Movement has achieved great success in the past two or three months. In this movement, first of all, right-leaning conservative thinking and bureaucratic work styles in leadership were powerfully criticized. Factories and mines extensively launched mass criticism and self-criticism, and workers and staff put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals, breaking through outdated quotas and obsolete technical standards, thereby formulating relatively advanced enterprise production, technology, and financial plans. Second, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of workers and staff has been further enhanced. In the movement, a new atmosphere of learning from the advanced and helping the backward emerged. After the central government convened the intellectuals' conference, engineering and technical personnel were even more encouraged, criticized the idea of "seeking no merit, but seeking no demerit," and actively participated in socialist competition. Third, a large number of advanced producers and advanced units emerged in the movement, and advanced experiences were learned and promoted. According to statistics in mid-March, more than 87,000 advanced producers have emerged in Liaoning Province, and 50,000 advanced producers have emerged in Shanghai. At present, the ranks of advanced producers in various regions are constantly expanding.

Lai Ruoyu said that there are still many urgent problems to be solved in various places in carrying out the Advanced Producer Movement. These problems are, first, that although new records continue to appear in some enterprises, the monthly plan has still not been completed. Furthermore, the quality of many factories and mines has declined in the movement. Even more serious is that the number of casualties has been on the rise in the past two months. The above phenomena are mainly due to: (1) Many units have not grasped the central principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, and the leadership of the Advanced Producer Movement has a certain degree of blindness and formalism. Some units blindly pursue output, neglecting quality, neglecting safety, and neglecting equipment maintenance. Some units inappropriately emphasize "breaking with convention," even treating safety regulations as "restrictive rules." (2) Enterprise management has not kept up. The direction for promoting advanced experience is not clear, and the handling of workers' rationalization proposals is not timely. There are still some shortcomings in competition rewards, such as egalitarianism, failure to reward when due, or the phenomenon of simply replacing material rewards with honorary awards still exists. (3) Many units are keen on making proposals, but have not seriously organized the implementation of the proposals.

In his conversation, Lai Ruoyu pointed out that in order to solve these problems one by one, consolidate the high enthusiasm of the masses, and continuously carry out the Advanced Producer Movement, trade union organizations at all levels must pay attention to the following tasks:

One, fully implement the central principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. The leadership must deeply analyze the key and weak links in production, point out specific directions for struggle to the masses, and pay special attention to guiding the enthusiasm of the masses to improve product quality, and strive for more and faster on the basis of good and economical.

Two, strengthen the specific organizational work of promoting advanced experience, and specifically organize advanced workers and advanced units to help backward workers and backward units. Adopt forms such as advanced experience schools and technical mutual aid groups to specifically help backward workers and backward units improve to advanced levels. The rationalization proposals put forward by employees must be dealt with in a timely manner.

Three, organize departmental competitions, improve enterprise management, strengthen workshop work, and create the necessary good conditions for workers' labor. Sign liaison contracts between departments and workshops to strengthen their coordination and cooperation, mobilize engineering and technical personnel to carry out professional competitions, and organize them to closely cooperate with production workers to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of engineering and technical personnel.

Four, conscientiously do a good job in the upcoming wage reform, establish and improve the necessary reward system, and consolidate the labor enthusiasm of the masses from a material perspective. Trade union organizations must also pay attention to the formulation of quotas, and revise backward quotas based on advanced experience. However, the revision of quotas must have a certain time limit and must be carefully studied, and a series of measures must be taken to help workers reach the quotas. Absolutely do not rashly revise the quota simply because the worker breaks the quota.

Five, in order to consolidate the labor enthusiasm of employees, the leadership must take the initiative to care about the lives of the masses. To this end, attention should be paid to improving workers' working conditions, strengthening labor protection, and improving housing, canteens, nurseries, and other work. To do these tasks well, it is also necessary to earnestly establish a mass supervision system from the bottom up and oppose bureaucratic work styles.

### 把先进生产者运动持续地开展下去  赖若愚指出各级工会组织应当注意的工作

    把先进生产者运动持续地开展下去
    赖若愚指出各级工会组织应当注意的工作
    据新华社26日讯  中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，今天对本社记者谈关于当前全国各地开展先进生产者运动的情况。
    赖若愚说，在最近两三个月的时期中，先进生产者运动已经取得了很大的成绩。在这次运动中，首先有力地批判了领导上的右倾保守思想和官僚主义作风。各厂矿企业广泛地开展群众性的批评和自我批评，职工群众提出了成千上万条合理化建议，纷纷突破了陈旧的定额，打破了过时的技术标准，从而制定出比较先进的企业生产技术财务计划。其次，广大职工群众的社会主义觉悟有了进一步的提高。运动中，出现了学习先进、帮助落后的新气象。在中央召开知识分子会议以后，工程技术人员更加鼓舞起来，批判了“不求有功，但求无过”的思想，积极地参加了社会主义竞赛。第三，在运动中涌现出大批的先进生产者和先进单位，学习和推广了先进经验。据三月中旬统计，辽宁省已经涌现出八万七千多名先进生产者，上海市已经涌现出五万名先进生产者。目前，各地先进生产者的队伍正在不断扩大。
    赖若愚说，各地在开展先进生产者运动中，也还存在不少急待解决的问题。这些问题，首先是一些企业单位虽然新纪录不断出现，但是月计划仍然没有完成。再者，在运动中仍有不少厂矿质量下降。更严重的是最近两个月来伤亡事故有上升趋势。产生以上现象，主要是由于：（一）不少单位没有掌握中央又多、又快、又好、又省的方针，对于先进生产者运动的领导有一定程度的盲目性和形式主义。有的单位盲目追求产量，忽视质量，忽视安全，忽视设备维护。有的单位不适当地强调“打破常规”，甚至把保安规程也当作“清规戒律”。（二）企业管理工作还没有跟上去。对推广先进经验的方向不明确，对职工的合理化建议处理不及时。竞赛奖励中还有一些缺点，如平均主义、该奖不奖、或单纯以荣誉奖代替物质奖的现象仍然存在。（三）不少单位热中于提倡议，但是没有认真组织倡议的实现。
    赖若愚在谈话中指出，为了使这些问题能够逐一得到解决，把群众的高涨的热情巩固起来，使先进生产者运动持续地开展下去，各级工会组织必须注意以下几项工作：
    一、全面贯彻中央又多、又快、又好、又省的方针。领导上必须深入分析生产关键和薄弱环节，向群众指出具体的奋斗方向，尤其要注意引导群众的热情去改进产品质量，在好和省的基础上求得多和快。
    二、加强推广先进经验的具体组织工作，具体组织先进工人和先进单位帮助落后工人和落后单位。采用先进经验学校、技术互助小组等形式，具体帮助落后工人和落后单位提高到先进水平。对于职工提出的合理化建议，必须及时处理。
    三、组织科室竞赛，改进企业管理，加强车间工作，为工人的劳动创造必要的良好条件。签订科室之间车间之间的联系合同，加强他们之间的配合协作，发动工程技术人员开展同业务竞赛，并且组织他们同生产工人密切合作，充分发挥工程技术人员的积极性和创造性。
    四、切实作好即将进行的工资改革工作，建立和健全必要的奖励制度，从物质方面来巩固群众的劳动热情。工会组织还必须注意定额的制定工作，根据先进经验修改落后定额。但是修改定额必须有一定期限，并且要经过慎重研究，采取一系列措施帮助工人达到定额。绝不能因为工人突破定额，就冒然修改。
    五、为了把职工的劳动热情巩固下来，领导上必须主动地关心群众生活。为此，要注意改善工人的劳动条件，加强劳动保护工作，改善住宅、食堂、托儿所等工作。而要做好这些工作，还必须认真建立自下而上的群众性的监督制度，反对官僚主义的工作作风。
