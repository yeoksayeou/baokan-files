Xinhua News Agency, April 28th. TASS reports: On the morning of April 27th, after Bulganin and Khrushchev held a press conference in London's famous Central Hall, they went to Victoria Station, where a special train to Portsmouth was waiting for them.

    At the exit of Central Hall and in front of Victoria Station, many residents of the British capital greeted the Soviet guests.

    Eden saw the Soviet leaders off at the station platform. Also present were Lloyd, Cilcennin, Reading, Hayter, as well as the head of the diplomatic corps, the Norwegian Ambassador to London, Prebensen.

    Bulganin made a short speech in front of the microphone. He first expressed his gratitude to the leaders of the British government for the reception and cooperation extended to the Soviet leaders. He said that this cooperation had brought good results.

    Bulganin said that the talks had created new conditions for further improving relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. There are now broader possibilities for developing political and economic cooperation, as well as cultural and scientific ties. The most valuable thing is that our talks were characterized by a spirit of mutual trust, which is essential for resolving outstanding international issues.

    Bulganin said that our talks show that agreements can be reached between the Soviet Union and Western countries on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence. He said that active economic cooperation and broad trade without restrictions and discrimination can be a good foundation for peaceful coexistence.

    Bulganin concluded by wishing the British people success and prosperity, and wishing their noble efforts for peace and international cooperation to achieve success.

    British Prime Minister Eden also spoke in front of the microphone. He said: I would like to express my gratitude for your patience and perseverance, which you have shown in carrying out what I consider to be such a difficult and tiring program. Our talks have continued for a long time. I have no doubt that these talks will be beneficial to the relations between our two countries and the cause of world peace. I thank you for coming to our country and wish you a safe journey home.

    After warmly bidding farewell to Prime Minister Eden, the Soviet leaders entered the carriages of the special train. The special train left Victoria Station at 11:10 a.m. and arrived at the Portsmouth Harbour Railway Station at 1:10 p.m. Afterwards, the distinguished guests traveled by car to the pier where the cruiser "Ordzhonikidze" was docked.

    Bulganin and Khrushchev, accompanied by Lloyd, boarded the cruiser "Ordzhonikidze." Among those seeing them off in Portsmouth were the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hayter, the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Gromyko, and the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Malik, and others.

    At 2:15 p.m., the cruiser "Ordzhonikidze" weighed anchor. At this time, the signal flag "Goodbye, bon voyage!" was raised on the signal flagpole in Portsmouth Harbor. The cruiser "Ordzhonikidze," escorted by the destroyers "Perfect" and "Lookout," left Portsmouth Harbor and sailed to the Soviet Union.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫离英返国
    新华社28日讯  据塔斯社讯：四月二十七日上午，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在伦敦著名的中央大厅举行记者招待会以后，就前往维多利亚车站，那里有一列开往朴次茅斯的专车等着他们。
    在中央大厅的出口处和维多利亚车站前面，许多英国首都居民向苏联客人们致意。
    艾登在车站月台上送别苏联领导人。送行的还有劳埃德、西耳森宁、里丁、海特尔以及外交使团团长、挪威驻伦敦大使普雷本逊。
    布尔加宁在播音器前面发表了简短的讲话。他首先对英国政府领导人给予苏联领导人的招待和合作表示感谢。他说，这种合作带来了良好的结果。
    布尔加宁说，这次会谈为进一步改善英苏两国之间的关系创造了新的条件。在发展政治和经济合作方面，在发展文化和科学联系方面，现在有更广泛的可能了。最宝贵的是，我们这次会谈的特征是一种相互信任的精神，这对于解决悬而未决的国际问题是十分必要的。
    布尔加宁说，我们的会谈表明，苏联和西方国家之间是可以在和平共处原则的基础上达成协议的。他说，积极的经济合作和没有限制和歧视的广泛的贸易可以成为和平共处的良好基础。
    布尔加宁最后祝英国人民成功和繁荣，祝他们要求和平和国际合作的崇高努力获得成就。
    英国首相艾登也在播音器前讲话。他说：我想对你们的耐心和坚持精神表示感谢，这种精神表现在你们在执行我所认为的那么困难和令人疲劳的计划上。我们的会谈继续了很久。我毫不怀疑这次会谈对于我们两国关系和世界和平事业是有益的。我感谢你们到我们这儿来，祝你们在回国的旅途上一路平安。
    苏联的领导人在同艾登首相热情告别以后就走进专车的车厢中。专车在上午十一点十分离开维多利亚车站以后，在下午一点十分到达朴次茅斯的港口火车站。随后，贵宾们乘汽车前往“奥尔忠尼启则号”巡洋舰停泊的码头。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在劳埃德陪同下走上“奥尔忠尼启则号”巡洋舰。在朴次茅斯送行的人还有英国驻苏大使海特尔、苏联外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯、苏联驻英大使马立克等人。
    二点十五分，巡洋舰“奥尔忠尼启则号”起锚。这时在朴次茅斯港的信号旗竿上升起了“再见，一路平安！”的信号旗，巡洋舰“奥尔忠尼启则号”在驱逐舰“完美号”和“了望号”的护航之下，离开朴次茅斯港驶往苏联。
