The wives of diplomatic officials from seven Asian and European countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the closing ceremony.

The congress unanimously adopted the "Letter to Sisters of the Industrial and Commercial Circles Nationwide" from the National Congress of Industrialists and Businessmen's Families and Female Industrialists and Businessmen. This document puts forward five tasks for women in the industrial and commercial circles to work together on in the future, and calls on them to contribute more to the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland, and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, to unite closely with the people of the whole country to build our motherland into an independent, prosperous, strong and happy socialist industrial country.

After Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, spoke at the meeting, representatives of the families and children of industrialists and businessmen in Beijing extended congratulations and dedications to the meeting. Luo Shuzhang, the Executive Chairman of the congress, then delivered a closing speech at the meeting.

At present, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved great victories, but it is only the beginning of further in-depth transformation in the future. Women in the industrial and commercial sectors still have many tasks and heavy responsibilities in this regard. As long as everyone listens to Chairman Mao, follows the Communist Party, everyone's life will become happier and happier, and everyone's future is infinitely bright and beautiful.
