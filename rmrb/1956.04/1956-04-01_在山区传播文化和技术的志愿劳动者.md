    Volunteer Laborers Spreading Culture and Technology in Mountainous Areas
    Volunteer laborers who moved from the coastal plains of Fujian Province to develop mountainous areas have brought culture and technology to mountain villages.
    Forty-one households of members from the former Zheng Yi-mu Cooperative in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, who relocated to Gaobu Township, Nanping County, a remote mountain village, had some of their members selected as the vice-chairmen and production team leaders of local agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives, or as agricultural technicians. They taught local farmers methods to increase production such as improving soil, making compost, and selecting good seeds. This year, the double-cropping rice planting area of the local cooperative has expanded more than five times compared to the original plan. Among them, more than 150 mu of mountain terraced fields, which previously yielded a maximum of 400 jin of grain per mu, are planned to create a record of 1,000 jin per mu. The sweet potatoes intercropped in the local forest land now also employ the experience of wide ridges and dense planting from the plains areas, with some aiming for a yield of over 10,000 jin per mu.
    Volunteer laborer Ruan Wensheng, who has a junior high school education, became a teacher at the Gaobu Township's people-run school. In the past two months, he has established five literacy classes in eight natural villages throughout the township, mobilizing more than 200 illiterate people to enroll and learn to read. Two other volunteer laborers serve as administrators of the newly built small hydroelectric power station in the township. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在山区传播文化和技术的志愿劳动者
    从福建省沿海平原地区前往开发山区的志愿劳动者，把文化和技术带到了山村。
    移居偏僻山村南平县高埠乡的原福州市郊郑依牳合作社的四十一户社员，一部分被选为当地农林畜牧生产合作社的副社长、生产队长或者当了农业技术员。他们教给当地农民改良土壤、制作堆肥和选留良种等增产办法。今年，当地合作社双季稻种植面积比原计划扩大五倍多，其中150多亩过去每亩最多打谷四百斤的山垅梯田，计划创造每亩产量千斤的纪录；当地林地间种的甘薯，现在也采用了平原地区大畦密植的经验，其中一部分每亩产量要求达到万斤以上。
    具有初中文化水平的志愿劳动者阮文生当了高埠乡的民校教师，最近两个月来他在全乡八个自然村办了五个民校识字班，动员了二百多个文盲入学识字。另有两个志愿劳动者担任了这个乡新建成的小型水力发电站的管理员。（新华社）
