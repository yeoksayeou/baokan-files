Xinhua News Agency, April 8th, Dubrovnik (Yugoslavia) News: At the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council meeting on the afternoon of the 7th, the Union's Executive Committee's decision to admit the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union was unjustifiably rejected.
The agenda of the Council meeting on the 7th included the examination of the report of the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union regarding the resolution it passed at the Delhi meeting in 1955. At that meeting, the Executive Committee decided to admit the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union by a vote of four to three.
At the meeting, Polish representative Lublicinski suggested that the Executive Committee's report be put to a vote without discussion. The first part of the Polish proposal—to put the Executive Committee's report to a vote without discussion—was passed by a majority. Subsequently, the second part of the Polish proposal—that the Council adopt the Executive Committee's report on the admission of the People's Republic of China to the Inter-Parliamentary Union—was put to a vote. The result of the vote was: 23 in favor, 32 against, and 5 abstentions, and the report was rejected. Violating the demands of world opinion, the representative of Thailand suggested at the meeting that the issue of admitting the People's Republic of China be postponed until the United Nations makes a decision on the issue of China's seat.
The Council's Disarmament Committee and Non-Self-Governing Territories Committee concluded their work on the morning of the 7th and passed resolutions to be submitted to the Council meeting.
The resolution of the Disarmament Committee calls on parliaments around the world to urge their governments, especially the governments of countries represented on the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, to continue to strive for a general agreement on disarmament.
The draft resolution passed by the Non-Self-Governing Territories Committee states that all nations have an inalienable right to govern themselves. The committee recommends that the Inter-Parliamentary Union Council include this issue on the agenda of the 45th Annual Conference in Bangkok.

    各国议会联盟理事会会议
    无理拒绝接纳我国加入联盟
    新华社8日讯　杜布罗夫尼克（南斯拉夫）消息：在各国议会联盟理事会七日下午的会议上，联盟执行委员会关于接纳中华人民共和国加入各国议会联盟的决定遭到无理否决。
    理事会七日会议的议程中包括审议各国议会联盟执行委员会关于它在1955年德里会议上通过的决议的报告。执行委员会在那次会议上以四票对三票决定接纳中华人民共和国加入各国议会联盟。
    波兰代表卢比钦斯基在会议上建议不经过讨论即就执行委员会的报告进行表决。波兰提案的第一部分——不经过讨论就把执行委员会的报告付诸表决——被多数通过。接着，波兰提案第二部分——理事会通过执行委员会关于接纳中华人民共和国加入各国议会联盟的报告——提付表决。表决的结果是：二十三票赞成，三十二票反对，五票弃权，报告被否决。违反各国舆论的要求，泰国代表在会上建议接纳中华人民共和国的问题延迟到联合国就中国席位问题作出决定以后再来考虑。
    理事会的裁军委员会和非自治领土委员会七日上午结束了工作，并且通过了将要提交理事会会议的决议。
    裁军委员会的决议呼吁全世界各国议会要求它们的政府，特别是有代表参加联合国裁军小组委员会的国家的政府，继续努力争取在裁军问题上达成一项总的协议。
    非自治领土委员会所通过的决议草案认为，一切民族都有自己管理自己的不可剥夺的权利。委员会建议各国议会联盟理事会把这个问题列入曼谷第四十五届年会的议程。
