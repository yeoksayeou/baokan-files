    Datong Coal Mine Improves Four Coal Mining Methods
    Recently, employees of the Datong Coal Mine in Huainan put forward a number of rationalization proposals, which improved four coal mining methods that were previously considered "finalized."
    The Datong Coal Mine originally used four coal mining methods: stepped face, wooden board false roof, metal mesh false roof, and bamboo curtain false roof. The efficiency of each coal miner was generally only about three tons. Recently, worker Hu Dongyou proposed changing the stepped face from mining one cut of coal at a time to mining three cuts at a time. The test results showed that the coal mining efficiency per worker increased to more than six tons. Suggestions for improving the other three coal mining methods put forward by workers and cadres have also been basically successfully tested. It is estimated that after the new methods are promoted, the overall coal mining efficiency of the mine will increase by one to one and a half times compared to last year.

    大通煤矿改进四种采煤方法
    淮南大通煤矿职工最近提出一批合理化建议，使过去认为已经“定型”的四种采煤方法都有了改进。
    大通煤矿原来采用的是台阶、木板假顶、金属网假顶、竹帘假顶等四种采煤方法，每个采煤工的效率一般只达到三吨左右。工人胡东又最近提出了台阶掌子面由一次采一碴煤改一次采三碴的建议，试验结果，每工采煤效率提高到六吨多。工人和干部们提出的改进其他三种采煤法的建议，也基本上试验成功。预计新的方法被推广以后，全矿的采煤效率将比去年提高一倍到一倍半。
