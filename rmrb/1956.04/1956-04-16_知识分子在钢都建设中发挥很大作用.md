Xinhua News Agency report:

    Intellectuals in Anshan have played a significant role in the construction of the steel city over the past few years. Shao Xianghua, Director of the Technology Department and Chief Engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, actively implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, greatly promoting the technical research and management work of the Technology Department. He also authored "Steel Metallurgy" and translated more than a dozen papers on steel metallurgy. During the early recovery of Anshan Iron and Steel, Chief Engineer Yang Shutang participated in the research of using fixed open-hearth furnaces to smelt silicon steel and achieved success, solving the problem of motor manufacturing during the recovery period of Anshan Iron and Steel. Recently, he proposed the suggestion of using old steel billets to roll steel, and organized everyone to implement this suggestion, adding more than 5 million yuan of wealth to the country.

    In the past six years, forty-seven intellectuals in Anshan have been awarded the title of Model Worker of Anshan City, and this year, 125 people were elected as representatives to attend the city's Advanced Producers Representative Conference.

    The ranks of intellectuals and the scientific and technological level in Anshan City are also growing rapidly. The number of engineering and technical personnel in Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, and design and geological departments has increased tenfold compared with the early recovery period, of which more than 900 are of worker origin. With the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, they have learned many technologies that they did not understand at all in the past. In their practical work, they have also cultivated many new technical forces. After several years of practical work, more than 300 graduates from universities after liberation have been promoted to assistant engineers.

    知识分子在钢都建设中发挥很大作用
    鞍山市的知识分子几年来在钢都的建设事业中发挥了很大的作用。鞍山钢铁公司技术处处长、总工程师邵象华，积极执行苏联专家建议，使技术处的技术研究和管理工作得到很大开展。他还著了“钢铁冶金学”和翻译了十几种关于钢铁冶金的论文。总工程师杨树棠在鞍钢恢复初期，参加了用固定式平炉冶炼矽钢的研究，并且获得成功，解决了鞍钢恢复时期的电机制造问题。不久前，他又提出利用旧钢坯轧成钢材的建议，并且组织大家实现了这个建议，给国家增加了五百多万元的财富。
    六年来，鞍山市有四十七名知识分子被评为鞍山市的劳动模范，今年还有125人当选为出席全市先进生产者代表会议的代表。
    鞍山市知识分子的队伍和科学技术水平也在迅速地成长，鞍山钢铁公司、鞍山钢铁建设公司和设计、地质部门的工程技术人员，比恢复初期增加了十倍，其中有九百多人是工人出身。他们在苏联专家的热心帮助下，学会了很多过去根本不懂的技术。他们在实际工作中，还培养了很多新生的技术力量。解放后的大学毕业生，经过几年实际工作的锻炼，已经有三百多人被提升为助理工程师。
