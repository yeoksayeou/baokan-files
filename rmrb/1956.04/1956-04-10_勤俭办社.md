    Running Cooperatives Diligently and Frugally
    Correcting Extravagance and Waste
    Zhejiang Province, in its spring rectification of cooperatives, corrected the extravagance and waste in some agricultural cooperatives.
    In Cixi County, 19.9% of the 640 cooperatives originally had serious extravagance and waste; all were corrected during the rectification. The cadres of the Chengnan Cooperative in Pingyang County originally planned to replace all old-style farm tools with new ones, even if the old ones were still usable. As a result, each laborer in the cooperative would have to bear an investment of 95.9 yuan, and the members reflected that they were burdened with debt as soon as they joined. Their enthusiasm for production was low. In this rectification, after tightening and reducing expenses that were not essential, the investment burden per laborer was reduced to 7.2 yuan, and the members' enthusiasm for production increased.
    Establishing a System for Comparing and Appraising Thrift
    The Changfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, established a system for comparing and appraising thrift, saving more than 8,000 yuan in expenses in the first quarter of this year. This saved money could increase the income of each member household in the cooperative by nearly 30 yuan.
    In implementing the financial plan, the Changfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative holds a thrift comparison and appraisal every two months, giving commendations or material rewards to production teams or individuals who have completed the production plan and saved expenses. As a result, the members have generally developed a habit of thrift. For example, the cooperative originally planned to purchase 20% of commercial fertilizer for spring plowing this year, but the members felt that the plan was too large and proposed methods for finding and accumulating natural fertilizer. After the implementation of the method of accumulating fertilizer, the cooperative only needed to buy half of the originally planned amount of commercial fertilizer.
    Promoting the Experience of Formulating Annual Revenue and Expenditure Plans
    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently instructed all counties to promote the experience of Hongzhao County in formulating annual agricultural production revenue and expenditure plans, and to comprehensively implement the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and frugally."
    The instructions briefly introduced the content and basic methods of Hongzhao County's annual revenue and expenditure plan. Since the beginning of spring, the 203 agricultural production cooperatives in Hongzhao County have generally experienced a tendency for production increase plans to be too high and too urgent, chaotic expenditures, and blindly requesting national loans. After discovering this situation, the Hongzhao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party accepted the lesson learned from individual cooperatives last year that increased production but reduced member income, and immediately sent cadres to conduct in-depth investigations in typical cooperatives, calculating in detail the three accounts of increased production, investment, and member income in 1956, and finally formulating a plan. The total income of agriculture and sideline occupations in the county increased by 59.5% compared with 1955, the total investment in agriculture and sideline occupations increased by 58.1%, and the actual income of members increased by 20%. Through this thorough investigation and accounting, they also found fifteen ways to increase production and save money. The amount of non-production expenditure in the county is sufficient with the funds allocated by the state and legitimate loans from banks.
    The instructions emphasized the benefits of formulating revenue and expenditure plans. In the past, agricultural production cooperatives in Hongzhao County competed to ask the county for fertilizer and loans, but now each cooperative is automatically thinking of ways to increase production and save money.
    Helping Agricultural Cooperatives to Use Loans Rationally
    People's Banks in various parts of Jiangsu Province are promoting a new method of planned lending to agricultural production cooperatives. When issuing loans, they help agricultural cooperatives formulate and revise production and financial plans, achieving the goal of running cooperatives diligently and frugally, reducing costs, and increasing income. The Xindong and Xinle agricultural cooperatives in Songjiang County initially relied solely on loans, requesting loans of 2,184 yuan. After repeated research by bank cadres, they rationally used funds, vigorously accumulated natural fertilizer, and exploited the potential of old farm tools, reducing the loan amount to 400 yuan. The Lianmeng Agricultural Cooperative in Puzhuang Township, Zhenze County, originally planned to purchase human manure for fertilizer for rapeseed, costing 8 yuan per mu. When providing the loan, bank cadres helped them study and change to granular fertilizer, reducing the cost to 2 yuan per mu. The 1,864 mu of rapeseed in the cooperative saved more than 10,000 yuan in production costs. The Advanced First Agricultural Cooperative in Wuxian County changed its plan to build new pigsties, with the agricultural cooperative uniformly purchasing piglets and handing them over to members for private raising, leveraging the role of the members' existing pigsties, reducing loans, and saving production costs.
    This year, the total bank agricultural loans and credit cooperative loans in Jiangsu Province amounted to more than 210 million yuan, equivalent to 2.3 times the actual number of loans last year. Comprehensively implementing the planned loan method will play a significant role in increasing grain and cotton production.
      Extensive Use of Old Farm Tools
    The Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mingdong Township, Jiashan County, Anhui Province, saved 13,000 yuan by repairing old farm tools on a large scale.
    The Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative originally had enough carts, seeders, plows, and harrows, which could meet the needs of the cooperative's production this year with only minor repairs. However, due to the view of a few cadres that "everything should be new and good" when running a large cooperative, they ignored the use of old farm tools and blindly planned to buy fifty carts and many waterwheels, seeders, and harrows.
    Recently, the members' representative assembly of this cooperative seriously discussed the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and frugally," criticized the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, and decided to focus on repairing old farm tools. As a result, the cooperative can buy forty fewer carts and twenty-five fewer waterwheels, seeders, and harrows, saving more than 13,000 yuan.
      Streamlining Institutions
    The management committee of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative on the outskirts of Kunming City, which used to be composed of five directors and twelve members, was reduced to two directors and seven members in mid-March. The five departments, one office, one section, and nine specialized management committees originally under the management committee were also abolished. More than sixty members streamlined from the management committee and various specialized committees were assigned to production teams to serve as captains or deputy captains. The members felt that the production team could solve problems, and their confidence in production increased. Now the attendance rate of the whole cooperative has increased from a maximum of 70% in the past to 90%. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    勤俭办社
    纠正铺张浪费现象
    浙江省在今春整社工作中，纠正了部分农业社的铺张浪费现象。
    慈溪县六百四十个社中，原有19.9％的社是有严重铺张浪费现象的，在整社中都得到了纠正。平阳县城南社社干部原来计划：能用的旧式农具也不用了，完全换成新式的。这样，全社每个劳力就要负担投资九十五元九角，社员反映：刚进门来就背上了债。生产情绪低落。在这次整社中，紧缩和减少了可用可不用的费用后，每个劳力负担的投资减少到七元二角，社员生产劲头提高了。
    建立节约评比制度
    湖北省孝感县长风农业生产合作社建立节约评比制度，在今年第一季度里节约开支八千多元。这笔节约下来的钱可以使全社每户社员增加近三十元的收入。
    长风农业生产合作社在执行财务计划中，每两个月举行一次节约评比，对完成了生产计划又节约了开支的生产队或个人，给予表扬或物质奖励。因此，社员普遍养成了一种节约风气。例如，全社原计划今年春耕用肥中要购买20％的商品肥，社员们认为计划太大，就提出寻找和积自然肥料的办法。积肥办法实行后，全社商品肥只买原计划的一半就够用了。
    推广制定全年收支计划的经验
    中共山西省委员会最近指示各县推广洪赵县制定全年农业生产收支计划的经验，全面贯彻执行“勤俭办社”的方针。
    指示中扼要介绍了洪赵县制定全年收支计划的内容和基本方法。洪赵县的203个农业生产合作社在开春以来普遍发生增产计划偏高偏急，开支混乱和盲目要求国家贷款的偏向。中共洪赵县委员会发现这种情况后，接受去年个别社增产多而社员收入减少的教训，立即派干部深入典型社调查，详细计算1956年增产、投资和社员收入等三笔账，最后订出计划。全县农、副业总收入比1955年增长59.5％，农、副业总投资增加58.1％，社员实际收入增加20％。通过这次周详的调查和算账，他们还找到十五个增产节约的门路。全县非生产开支的数目，用国家拨给的经费和向银行正当贷款就足够了。
    指示强调指出制定收支计划的好处。洪赵县各地农业生产合作社过去争相向县里要肥料要贷款，现在各社都自动想增产节约的办法。
    帮助农业合作社合理使用贷款
    江苏省各地人民银行对农业生产合作社推行计划贷款的新办法，在发放贷款时，帮助农业社制定和修改生产财务计划，达到了勤俭办社，降低成本增加收入的目的。松江县新东和新乐两个农业社，开始单纯依赖贷款，要求贷款2，184元，经过银行干部反复研究，合理使用资金，大力增积自然肥料，发挥旧农具潜力，贷款额减少到四百元。震泽县浦庄乡联盟农业社，原计划油菜施肥购买人粪，每亩成本八元，在贷款时，银行干部帮助研究改用颗粒肥料，每亩成本降低到二元，全社1，864亩油菜，就节约生产费用一万多元。吴县先进第一农业社，改变新盖猪舍的计划，由农业社统一购买小猪，交社员私养，发挥社员原有猪舍的作用，减少了贷款，节省了生产费用。
    江苏省今年银行农业贷款和各地信用社贷款资金共两亿一千多万元，等于去年实际贷款数的二点三倍，全面贯彻计划贷款的办法，对于粮棉增产将发挥很大作用。
      大量利用旧农具
    安徽嘉山县明东乡五一农业生产合作社，大量修理旧农具，节省开支一万三千元。
    五一农业社原来有足够的车、耩、犁、耙，只要稍加修理就可以满足全社今年生产的需要。但由于少数干部认为办大社就要样样新、样样好，忽视利用旧农具，盲目的计划买五十辆大车和许多水车、耩、耙。
    最近，这个社的社员代表大会认真讨论了“勤俭办社”的方针，批判了上述错误思想，决定以修理旧农具为主。结果，全社可以少买四十辆大车和二十五张水车、耩、耙，节省了一万三千多元。
      精简机构
    昆明市郊先锋农业生产合作社过去由五个主任、十二个委员组成的社务管理委员会，在三月中旬已缩减成两个主任和七个委员。原来社务管理委员会下设的五部、一室、一股和九个专业管理委员会，也都取消了。从社务管理委员会和各专业委员会精简下来的六十多个委员，被分派到各生产队里去担任队长或副队长。社员们感到生产队能解决问题，生产信心增强了。现在全社出勤率由过去最高70％提高到90％。（据新华社讯）
