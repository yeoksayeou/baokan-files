Shanghai Port Authority Discovers in Old Archives
    Fifty-Year-Old Charts of the Huangpu River

    The Shanghai District Port Administration recently discovered a batch of charts of the Huangpu River from fifty years ago in its old archives. These charts show that the Huangpu River's riverbed has changed very little, and the annual sediment accumulation is not significant. Based on this, Shanghai port technicians have further confirmed that the annual dredging volume of the Huangpu River can be reduced without affecting the smooth passage of the waterway. In this way, more than one million yuan in dredging costs can be saved each year.

    Among these old archives, the Shanghai District Port Administration also found more than 3,600 original documents related to the architectural structure, load-bearing capacity, and other data of the port's wharves and warehouses. These materials provide a valuable basis for the comprehensive plan being developed by the Shanghai Port to rationally utilize the wharves and warehouses and fully leverage their potential. In addition, more than 2,200 historical charts of coastal and Yangtze River ports such as Dalian, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, and Yichang were discovered and will be classified, numbered, and then transferred to the respective locations.

    Currently, a specialized team organized by the Shanghai District Port Administration is continuing to sort through more than 10,000 engineering and technical archives left over from the past century.

    上海港务局从旧档案中发现
    五十年前的黄埔江图表
    上海区港务管理局，最近从旧档案中发现了一批五十年以前的黄浦江图表。这些图表说明，黄浦江河床变化很小，每年泥沙淤积量不多。上海港技术人员由此进一步肯定了黄浦江每年挖泥量可以减少，不会影响航道畅通。这样，每年就可以节约疏浚费用一百万元以上。
    在这些旧档案当中，上海区港务管理局还找出了全港码头、仓库的建筑结构、负荷强度等原始资料三千六百多幅，这些资料给上海港正在制定中的合理使用码头、仓库，充分发挥它们的潜力的全面规划，提供了宝贵的根据。此外，还发现大连、天津、广州、汉口、重庆、宜昌等沿海和长江港口的历史图表两千二百多幅，将经过分类、编号以后，分别转交出去。
    目前，上海区港务管理局专门组织的一批人员继续对近百年来留下的一万多幅工程技术档案进行整理。
