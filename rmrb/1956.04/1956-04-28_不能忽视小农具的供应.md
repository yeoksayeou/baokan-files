    The Supply of Small Farm Tools Cannot Be Ignored
    Ge Feng
    Among some staff members of supply and marketing cooperatives, there is a tendency to underestimate the supply of small farm tools. Some believe that "after collectivization, agricultural production cooperatives need new and large farm tools, and small farm tools will be eliminated;" others believe that "managing small farm tools is not respectable, it is better to manage large farm tools;" some are afraid of stockpiling and losing money by managing small farm tools. Therefore, they simply reach out for new and large farm tools and neglect to develop local sources of small farm tools, resulting in shortages of old-fashioned and small farm tools in many areas, which affects agricultural production.
    After agricultural cooperation, it is natural for farmers to use more large-scale new farm tools in order to achieve the task of increasing agricultural production; it is very necessary to actively supply new farm tools. However, new farm tools cannot completely replace small and old-fashioned farm tools in the short term. Due to the development of agricultural cooperation, the demand for small water conservancy tools, transportation tools, etc. by farmers has also increased; due to the gradual reform of agricultural production technology, farmers are asking to add improved small farm tools such as small close-planting hoes and close-planting seeders. Therefore, it is wrong to neglect the supply of small farm tools.
    To do a good job in the supply of small farm tools, supply and marketing cooperatives must be well combined with handicraft production cooperatives to overcome the blindness of the production and sales of small farm tools. People remember that in 1955, the supply and marketing cooperatives had just eliminated the phenomenon of stockpiling small farm tools, and then a shortage of small farm tools appeared. The current situation is that some places have a backlog of small farm tools, while other places have a shortage of small farm tools. The main reason for this phenomenon of stockpiling and shortage, or stockpiling and shortage again, is the blindness in operation. To overcome this blindness, supply and marketing cooperatives must carefully investigate the production and needs of small farm tools. Some supply and marketing cooperatives hold small farm tool production, supply, and sales seminars with representatives from handicraft production cooperatives and handicraftsmen, as well as representatives from agricultural production cooperatives. They use methods such as commodity exhibitions, farmer appraisals, and mutual observation by handicraftsmen to understand the needs of the masses (including variety, quantity, specifications) and the output and cost of small farm tools. They also study and improve the specifications and quality of farm tools. This approach is worth promoting.
    Appropriate division of labor should be carried out in the supply and sales of small farm tools between supply and marketing cooperatives and between supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives.
    The division of labor between supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives can be as follows: Small farm tools produced and sold locally should be directly contracted for supply and sale by the handicraft production cooperative and the agricultural production cooperative. Small farm tools that are not produced enough locally and need to be purchased from other places should be purchased and supplied by the supply and marketing cooperative, and the handicraft production cooperative will not intervene in the operation. If the farm tools produced by the local handicraft production cooperative need to be adjusted within the county in addition to meeting local needs, the supply and marketing cooperative shall sign a contract with the handicraft production cooperative according to the needs of the sales area to organize the supply. If the supply and marketing cooperative needs to process raw materials purchased from other places into products locally, it can entrust the handicraft processing, and the supply and marketing cooperative will organize the supply. The repair and fitting of farm tools shall be the responsibility of the handicraft production cooperative (group). The retail prices of handicraft production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives should be consistent, and the two parties should negotiate jointly to unify the prices of products of the same specification and quality.
    Within the supply and marketing cooperative system, the division of labor should be based on the principle of giving full play to the business enthusiasm of the grassroots cooperatives, facilitating the masses, and conforming to accounting: For small farm tools that need to be adjusted within the county, the county cooperative should organize the grassroots cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives to sign contracts, which shall be operated by the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, and the county cooperative shall generally not intervene. For distant products that are inconvenient for the grassroots cooperatives to purchase directly, the grassroots cooperatives shall propose a requisition plan according to the needs of the local masses, and the county cooperative shall uniformly organize the source of goods and allocate them to the grassroots cooperatives for supply at the wholesale price.

    不能忽视小农具的供应
    戈锋
    在某些供销合作社工作人员中，有一种轻视小农具供应的思想。有的认为“合作化以后，农业生产合作社要的是新式农具和大型农具，小农具就要被淘汰了”；有的认为“经营小农具不体面，不如经营大农具好”；有的怕经营小农具积压、赔钱。因此，他们单纯伸手向上要新式大型农具，忽视了开拓地方小农具的货源，以致许多地区发生旧式农具和小农具脱销现象，影响了农业生产。
    农业合作化以后，农民为了实现农业增产任务，要更多地使用大型新式农具，这是很自然的；积极供应新式农具，是非常必要的。但是新式农具在短期内还不能全部代替小农具和旧式农具。由于农业合作化的发展，农民所需要的小型水利工具、运输工具等也增加了；由于农业生产技术的逐步改革，农民要求添置小密植锄、密植耧等改良小农具：所以，忽视小农具的供应是不对的。
    要做好小农具供应工作，供销合作社必须很好地同手工业生产合作社结合，克服小农具的生产和销售的盲目性。人们记得，1955年供销合作社刚刚消除了小农具积压现象，又出现了小农具脱销现象。目前的情况是：有些地方小农具积压，另一些地方小农具又在脱销。产生这种积压和脱销或者又积压又脱销的现象的主要原因，是经营上的盲目性。要克服这种盲目性，供销合作社必须细致地调查小农具的生产和需要。有些供销合作社举行有手工业生产合作社代表和手工业者代表、农业生产合作社代表参加的小农具产、供、销座谈会，通过商品展览、农民鉴定、手工业者互相观摩等方法，了解群众需要（包括品种、数量、规格），了解小农具的产量、成本，并且研究改进农具规格、质量。这种方式是值得提倡的。
    在供销合作社之间、供销合作社和手工业生产合作社之间，在小农具的供销方面应当进行适当的分工。
    在供销合作社和手工业生产合作社之间可以这样分工：当地生产、当地销售的小农具，由手工业生产合作社和农业生产社直接签订供货合同，直接买卖。当地生产不足、需要从外地买进的小农具，由供销合作社负责采买、供应，手工业生产社就不插手经营。当地手工业生产合作社生产的农具，如果除了供应当地需要以外还需要在县内调剂的时候，由供销合作社根据销地的需要和手工业生产合作社签订合同，组织供应。如果供销合作社需要把从外地买来的原料在当地加工成产品，可委托手工业加工，由供销合作社组织供应。农具的修配工作由手工业生产合作社（组）负责。手工业生产合作社和供销合作社的零售价格应取得一致，双方共同协商，把同一规格质量的产品的价格统一起来。
    在供销合作社系统内部，应该本着充分发挥基层社的经营积极性、便利群众、符合核算的原则进行分工：对于需要在县内进行调剂的小农具，县社要组织基层社和手工业生产社签订合同，由基层供销合作社经营，县社一般不要插手。基层社不便直接进货的远地产品，由基层社根据当地群众需要提出要货计划，由县社统一组织货源，按批发价拨给基层社进行供应。
