Fujian's Wheat Harvest

The barley and wheat in Putian County, Fujian Province, have increased by 30% to 50% this year compared to previous years. In mid-March, members of the Gangli Agricultural Production Cooperative began harvesting wheat.

After selling their wheat, the members of the Gangli Agricultural Production Cooperative immediately reinvested the funds into production. They are currently purchasing fertilizer powder at the supply and marketing cooperative.

Staff members from the Putian County Agricultural Technology Extension Station are summarizing high-yield experiences in high-yield wheat fields.

The Gangli Agricultural Production Cooperative sold 80,000 jin of wheat to the state. This set of pictures was taken by Ye Dakai.
