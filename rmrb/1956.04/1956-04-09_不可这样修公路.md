Highway Construction Should Not Be Done This Way

Recently, some areas of the Guilin Special District in Guangxi, when building rural highways, have been simply pursuing straight lines, resulting in excessive loss of fertile land. For example, Longshui District in Quan County planned to build 45 roads, resulting in the loss of 800 mu of fertile land. According to county-wide statistics, approximately 7,000 mu of paddy fields were lost due to road construction. This practice must be stopped, otherwise it will hinder the completion of increased production tasks.

    不可这样修公路
    广西桂林专区部分地区最近在修建农村公路的时候，单纯追求直线路，过多地损失良田。如全县龙水区规划修马路45条，共损失良田八百亩。据全县统计，因修马路约损失水田七千亩。这种作法必须停止，否则就会妨碍增产任务的完成。
