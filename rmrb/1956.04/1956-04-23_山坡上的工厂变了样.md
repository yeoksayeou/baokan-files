The Factory on the Hill Has Changed
By our reporter Li Ce

The Chongqing General Machinery Factory is built on a narrow hillside. In front is a steep riverbank, and behind it is a mountain. Everywhere there are winding, uneven stone roads. Therefore, many people in the factory said, "This factory has no future." In the past, the enterprise management work of this factory was the most backward among the mechanical factories in Chongqing. But in just over three months this year, the factory has undergone significant changes.

Last year, the factory received the task of trial-producing oil pumping units. With the efforts of all employees and engineering technicians, the trial production was successful in December, and mass production began this year. The planned output this year is more than double that of last year. The workers launched a socialist competition, and in the competition, they found eighteen key points in production, ten advanced experiences to be promoted, and nine basic measures. Through everyone's efforts, the total output value plan, the total commodity value plan, and the labor productivity plan were all overfulfilled in January, February, and March. They achieved the various targets of the inter-factory competition.

A beautiful vision of the factory's overall plan has emerged in the minds of the workers. Chen Furong, the leader of the cold work youth group in the forging and riveting workshop, said, "You think young people don't like to play? Look, what is there to play near the factory? On Sundays, they simply stay in the dormitory and sleep or read novels. To go to the city once, not to mention how far the road is, just taking the ferry and changing buses twice is enough. Some people in our group used to say: If I stay here, I definitely won't find a lover. Who wouldn't want to contribute to the construction of the country's oil industry? When they work, everyone is as lively as a dragon and a tiger."

The casting workshop had long promoted the experience of "one mold multiple castings," but only this year has it reached such a wide scale: all castings that can use this experience have adopted it, increasing efficiency by 40% and exceeding the quality targets. In order to meet the needs of mass production, metal molds have begun to be used in the workshop. The metalworking workshop has promoted various advanced Soviet cutting experiences. In the assembly workshop, the suggestions for improving operations and tools put forward by Yang Huaqing, a labor model in Chongqing, have been warmly supported by the workers.

The piece-rate wage system, which was originally planned to be implemented in the second half of the year, was implemented ahead of schedule. This further stimulated workers to learn advanced experiences, and the efficiency of various types of work has generally increased by 20%-30%, with the highest reaching 56%. The workers in the casting workshop took the initiative to request a reduction in work-hour quotas to ensure the completion of the first Five-Year Plan nineteen months ahead of schedule.

In the past, the metalworking workshop often failed to complete the monthly plan, and the processed parts were incomplete, affecting the assembly workshop's ability to complete its tasks. The administrative staff of the two workshops quarreled endlessly about this. This year, the processing of various product parts and the assembly of products have been unified in these two workshops. The metalworking workshop is able to process parts in batches in a planned manner. Therefore, they not only completed the product variety plan, but also additionally completed seven products of five types. This year, a tool section was established in the factory to ensure the supply of various tools. This year, the factory is going to trial-produce four new products. Without ready-made drawings, people were sent to Xinjiang, Gansu and other places to survey and map according to the physical objects. They know that their technical strength is weak, so they are doing process experiments on the oil pump, which is scheduled to be trial-produced in the second half of the year, now.

### 山坡上的工厂变了样

    山坡上的工厂变了样
    本报记者  李策
    重庆通用机器厂建立在狭窄的山坡上，前面是立陡的江岸，背后紧靠着一座山。到处是拐弯抹角、高低不平的石板路。因此，厂里不少人说：“这个厂没什么发展前途。”从前，这个厂的企业管理工作在重庆市的机械工厂中是最落后的。但在今年三个多月的光景，这个厂发生了显著的变化。
    这个厂去年接到试制石油抽油机的任务，在全体职工和工程技术人员的努力下，在十二月就试制成功了，今年就开始成批生产了。今年计划产量比去年的多二倍。职工们开展了社会主义竞赛，在竞赛中找出了生产上的十八个关键、要推广的十大先进经验和九项基本措施。经过大家的努力，一、二、三月份都超额完成了总产值计划、商品总值计划和劳动生产率计划。他们实现了厂际竞赛的各项指标。
    工厂的全面规划在工人们的心目中出现了一幅美丽的远景。锻铆车间冷作青年组长陈富荣说：“你想年轻人谁不爱玩，你看工厂附近有啥可玩的。星期天，干脆呆在寝室里睡大觉，看小说。进一次城，不用说路有多远，光是过轮渡，换两次公共汽车，就够受的。我们小组里过去有人说：在这里呆下去，保险找不到爱人。谁不愿意为祖国石油工业建设贡献一份力量。干起活来，个个像生龙活虎”。
    铸工车间早就推行过“一模多铸”的经验，但是唯有今年才达到这样广泛的程度：凡是能用这项经验的铸件，都采用了，工效提高40％，质量超过了计划指标。为了满足成批生产的需要，车间里开始采用金属模。金工车间推广了苏联各种切削的先进经验。在装配车间，重庆市劳动模范杨华清提出的各项改进操作、工具的建议，受到工人们热烈支持。
    原来计划在下半年实行的计件工资制提前实行了。这更刺激工人们学习先进经验，各工种的工效普遍提高20％—30％，最高达到56％。铸工车间的工人们主动要求压缩工时定额，保证提前十九个月完成第一个五年计划。
    金工车间过去经常完不成月计划，加工的配件不成套，影响装配车间完成任务。两个车间的行政人员为此吵闹不休。今年，这两个车间对各种产品配件的加工和产品的装配作了统一安排。金工车间能够有计划地成批地加工配件。因此，他们不仅完成了产品的品种计划，而且额外完成了五种七台产品。今年厂内建立了工具工段，保证了各种工具的供应。今年，工厂要试制四种新产品，没有现成的图纸，就派人到新疆、甘肃等地按照实物测绘。他们知道自己的技术力量薄弱，计划在下半年试制的石油泵，现在就做工艺试验。
