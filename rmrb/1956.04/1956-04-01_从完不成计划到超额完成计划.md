    Developing the Advanced Producer Movement

    From Failing to Meet Plans to Exceeding Them
    The No. 1 blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was named a "Youth Blast Furnace" at the end of January this year.

    From May to December of last year, this blast furnace frequently failed to meet its production plans. In order to change this situation, all the workers and technicians of the furnace put forward the slogan "Learn from advanced experiences, break through the 1957 targets, and strive to be named a Youth Blast Furnace in the first quarter of 1956" at the end of last year. Following this, they changed the charging system, implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, and learned from the advanced experiences of Anshan Iron and Steel and the specific operations of hot blast stoves. After these efforts, the furnace condition began to stabilize, and the maximum wind temperature rose from the original 880 degrees to 980 degrees, exceeding the second quarter plan target for this year by 30 degrees, and the output increased by 5%. In the first five days of January, the daily output level planned for 1957 was exceeded, and more than 100,000 yuan was saved due to the reduction in the coke ratio.

    The workers have launched a high tide of learning technology and exchanging experiences. The vast majority of young workers in the entire blast furnace have signed apprenticeship contracts with veteran technical workers. Everyone's enthusiasm for learning is particularly high, and some have quickly mastered technologies that used to take many years to learn. For example, third-grade worker Tian Mingxi basically mastered the operation technology of the mud gun at the furnace mouth, which used to take five or six years to master, in less than three months.

    Now, the workers of the "Youth Blast Furnace" have also proposed to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

### 从完不成计划到超额完成计划

    从完不成计划到超额完成计划
    石景山钢铁厂一高炉在今年一月底被命名为青年高炉。
    这个高炉，在去年五月到十二月，经常完不成计划。全炉工人和技术人员为了改变这种情况，在去年年底就提出了“学习先进经验，突破1957年指标，争取1956年第一季度命名为青年高炉”的口号。接着，他们就改变装料制度，执行苏联专家建议，学习鞍钢先进经验和热风炉具体操作等先进经验，经过这些努力，炉况才开始稳定，风温最高就由原来880度上升到980度，超过今年第二季度计划指标30度，产量提高了5％。一月份的前五天就突破了1957年计划日产量水平，并且由于降低了焦炭比例，节约了十万多元。
    工人们掀起了学习技术和交流经验的热潮。全高炉的青年工人，绝大多数都同老技术工人签订了师徒合同。大家的学习热情特别高，有的人很快就掌握了过去多年才能学会的技术。如三级工人田明喜，不到三个月就基本上掌握了在过去需要五六年才能掌握的炉口送泥枪的操作技术。
    现在，“青年高炉”的工人们又提出提前完成第一个五年计划的保证。
