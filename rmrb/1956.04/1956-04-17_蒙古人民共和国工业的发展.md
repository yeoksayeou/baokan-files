The Development of Industry in the Mongolian People's Republic
Mongolia, Su Ermarebu

With the help of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic has bypassed the stage of capitalist development and has transitioned from feudalism to the construction of socialism. One of the greatest achievements of our people during the era of the People's Democratic system is the establishment of our own industry from scratch.

Pre-revolutionary Mongolia bequeathed to us only its backward, simple natural-dependent animal husbandry industry. There was no industry whatsoever, not even a single agricultural product processing factory.

However, in the initial years of the people's government, the Party and the government paid close attention to the establishment of state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce, banks, transportation, and industry. The establishment of state industry and the birth of the working class had a decisive political significance in eliminating the domestic feudal landlord class and private capital.

Thanks to the wise leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, in the 35 years since the People's Revolution, industry has become the leading sector of the socialist component of the national economy. Comrade Tsedenbal, when talking about the development of our country's industry, pointed out that the young national industry, which accounts for almost half of our country's total national economic output in terms of proportion, has achieved particularly significant achievements in its development in the post-war era. Various sectors of heavy industry, such as mining, metal processing, coal mining, and power, are developing.

The development of our country's industry is most clearly reflected in the increase in industrial output value. In fourteen years, the industrial output value has increased by 4.6 times. If calculated at constant prices, the total output value of our country's industry in 1940 was 52 million tugriks (Mongolian currency), and in 1954 it was more than 290 million tugriks.

In our country, there is only socialist industry, and there is not a single private enterprise employing more than twenty workers. Industry is divided into two types: state-owned and cooperative-owned. In 1940, the output value of state-owned enterprises accounted for 55% of the total industrial output value, while cooperative-owned enterprises accounted for 45%. In 1954, the proportion of state-owned enterprises increased to 81%, while that of cooperative-owned enterprises decreased to 19%, indicating that state-owned enterprises are developing at a faster pace. During the aforementioned period, the output value of state-owned enterprises increased sevenfold, while that of cooperative-owned enterprises increased twofold.

In recent years, heavy industry – enterprises engaged in the mining industry, coal mining industry, electrical industry, and the production of building materials – has been continuously developing. Our country's industrial enterprises have also mastered the manufacture of machines and equipment that are urgently needed by industry and agriculture.

The strengthening of close economic ties with countries of the socialist camp has enabled us to first develop those industrial sectors that meet the requirements of our national economy. The state has allocated a lot of funds for expanding old enterprises and building new ones. In recent years alone, hundreds of millions of tugriks have been spent in this area. The chromium factory, tannery, machinery factory, furniture factory, and wool washing factory have been expanded; with the help of the Soviet Union, some mining enterprises have been established and equipped with the latest machinery and equipment.

The Twelfth Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, held in 1954, approved instructions regarding the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture, which pointed out the task of further accelerating the development of the country's industry. According to the provisions of the Second Five-Year Plan, the total output value of industrial products should increase by 46% in five years, with an average annual increase of 7.8%. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, certain major products will have the following increases: coal production will increase by 43%, electricity production – 42%, construction bricks – 250%, processed sheepskin and hides – 49%—92%, butter production – 16%, and sweets – 63%.

Currently, our country is carrying out the construction of the main shaft of the Nalaikh coal mine, which will produce 600,000 tons of coal per year. The initial phase of the expansion of the Ulaanbaatar thermal power plant was completed in 1955, and construction of the second phase has begun. In addition, we are also building match factories, sugar factories, soap factories, and oil extraction factories, and expanding meat processing complexes and building materials manufacturing factories.

The development of cooperative-owned enterprises in our country is the result of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's implementation of Lenin's instructions on the cooperative system. During the era of the People's Government, in addition to the development of consumer cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, cooperative-owned industry has also been developed. Currently, there are more than 100 handicraft cooperatives in our country, with more than 8,600 members. These cooperatives produce daily necessities.

Handicraft cooperatives were established in the 1930s. At that time, they produced products worth 1 to 2 million tugriks per year. Now, some large cooperatives produce products worth 4 to 5 million tugriks per year. In 1955, handicraft cooperatives completed 115% of the semi-annual plan, producing 17% more products than in the same period last year.

The 1955 national plan has been overfulfilled, with the industrial production plan completed by 104.6%. The total industrial output value increased by 15.5% compared to 1954, and the investment in basic construction expanded by 28.6% compared to 1954. The achievements made in 1955 in fulfilling the tasks of the Five-Year Plan have created realistic conditions for the early completion of the industrial tasks in the Five-Year Plan.

The successful completion of the task of developing industry in the Second Five-Year Plan will enable us to take a major step forward in the further and continuous development of our national industry.

    蒙古人民共和国工业的发展
    蒙古　苏尔马热布
    蒙古人民共和国在苏联帮助下越过了资本主义发展阶段，已从封建制度过渡到社会主义基础的建设。在人民民主制度年代中，我国人民所取得的最大成绩之一就是从无到有地建立了本国的工业。
    革命前的蒙古遗给我们的只有它的落后的、完全依赖自然的简单的畜牧业，没有任何工业，甚至连一所农产品加工工厂都没有。
    但是在人民政权的最初年代，党和政府就非常注意建立国营商业、合作社商业、银行、运输业和工业的工作。国家工业的建立和工人阶级的诞生对于消灭国内封建主阶级和私人资本有着决定性的政治意义。
    由于蒙古人民革命党的英明领导，在人民革命后的35年中，工业变成了国民经济中社会主义成分的主导部门。泽登巴尔同志在谈到我国工业的发展时指出，在比重上几乎占我国国民经济总产值一半的年轻的民族工业在战后年代的发展中取得了特别重大的成绩。重工业的各个部门，像矿山、金属加工、煤矿和动力这类工业部门都在发展着。
    我国工业的发展最明显地表现在工业产值的增加方面。在十四年内工业产值增长了四点六倍。如果按不变价格计算，1940年我国工业的总产值是五千二百万图格里克（蒙币），1954年是二亿九千多万图格里克。
    在我国只有社会主义工业，没有一个拥有二十个以上工人的私人企业。工业分为国营的和合作社营的两种。1940年国营企业产值占全部工业的55％，合作社营占45％。1954年国营企业产值的比重增为81％，而合作社营的降为19％，说明了国营企业在以更快的速度发展。在上述这段时期，国营企业的产值共增加了七倍，而合作社营企业的产值增加了一倍。
    近数年来重工业——采矿工业、采煤工业、电气工业的企业和生产建筑材料的企业等——不断地发展着。我国的工业企业也掌握了那些为工业和农业所迫切需要的机器和装备的制造。
    同社会主义阵营各国的密切的经济联系的加强，使得我们能够首先来发展适合我国国民经济要求的那些工业部门。国家为扩建旧企业并建设新企业拨出了很多的资金。仅在最近数年内在这方面就花费了数亿图格里克。扩建了制铬厂、制革厂、机械厂、家具工厂和洗毛工厂；在苏联的帮助下建立了一些矿山企业，并且使它们装备有最新的机器设备。
    1954年举行的蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会批准了关于发展国民经济和文化的第二个五年计划的指示，其中指出了进一步加速发展本国工业的任务。按照第二个五年计划的规定，五年中工业品的总产值应当增加46％，每年平均递增7.8％。在第二个五年计划时期某些主要产品将有如下的增长：煤产量增加43％，电力生产——42％，建筑用砖——250％，羊皮和兽皮的加工品——49％—92％，奶油产量——16％，糖食——63％。
    目前我国正在进行那莱哈煤矿主井的建设工作，这个矿井一年将出煤六十万吨。扩建乌兰巴托热电站的首批工程已于1955年竣工，并已开始进行第二部分工程的施工。此外我们还正在建筑火柴厂、糖厂、肥皂厂和榨油厂，并扩建肉品联合工厂和建筑材料制造工厂等。
    合作社营企业在我国的发展是蒙古人民革命党实现列宁关于合作制的指示的结果。在人民政权年代，除了发展消费合作社和农业合作社以外，也发展了合作社营工业。目前在我国共有一百多个工艺合作社，拥有社员八千六百多名。这些合作社生产日用品。
    工艺合作社是在三十年代建立的。那时它们一年生产价值一、二百万图格里克的产品。而现在一些巨大的合作社一年就生产价值四、五百万图格里克的产品。1955年工艺合作社完成了上半年计划115％，比去年同时期多生产了17％的产品。
    1955年的国家计划已经超额完成，其中工业生产计划完成了104.6％，工业总产值比1954年增加了15.5％，基本建设投资额比1954年扩大了28.6％。1955年在执行五年计划的任务方面取得的成绩，已为五年计划中工业任务的提前完成，创造了现实的条件。
    第二个五年计划中的发展工业任务的顺利完成，将使我们在进一步不断地发展我国民族工业方面迈进一大步。
