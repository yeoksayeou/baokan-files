Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: According to a United Press report from Newport, Rhode Island: Four US destroyers "ready for combat" departed from Newport, Rhode Island on April 15th, headed for the Mediterranean.

The report stated that these four warships were loaded with full stores of supplies and munitions. They are under orders to join the US Sixth Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean "in order to provide a broader base in the region and to conduct regular cruises in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean."

Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: TASS, New York, April 15th: According to a United Press correspondent in Washington, commentator Drew Pearson wrote in an article that the US Second Armored Tank Division has been ordered to move from West Germany to the Middle East within the next thirty days.

The Department of Defense and the State Department have vehemently denied this news, which was published by the "Times" of Connecticut. But Pearson said that after a "careful investigation," he believes this is indeed the case.

Pearson wrote that it is presumed that this division will be used to "protect" American expatriates in Saudi Arabia, where five or six thousand Americans work for the "Arabian-American Oil Company."

Pearson also wrote: Authorities have also ordered the Third Armored Tank Division, stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, to prepare to move to West Germany to replace the Second Armored Tank Division.

    美在中东制造紧张局势
    增派军舰和部队到那里去
    新华社16日讯　据合众社罗得岛新港消息：美国的四艘“作好战斗准备”的驱逐舰四月十五日从罗得岛新港开往地中海。
    消息说，这四艘军舰装有满仓的物资和军火。它们奉命参加驻在地中海的美国第六舰队，“以便在这个地区提供更加广泛的基地和经常在红海和印度洋进行巡游”。
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社纽约十五日讯：据合众社驻华盛顿记者报道，评论员德鲁·皮尔逊在一篇文章中写道，美国第二装甲坦克师奉命在最近三十天内从西德开往中东。
    国防部和国务院曾经断然否认康涅狄格州的“时报”刊载的这个消息。但是皮尔逊说，他经过“仔细的调查”以后，相信这是确有其事的。
    皮尔逊写道，据推测，这个师将用来“保护”美国在沙特阿拉伯的侨民；那里有五、六千名美国人在“阿拉伯—美国石油公司”中工作。
    皮尔逊还写道：当局还命令驻在肯塔基州诺克斯堡的第三装甲坦克师准备开往西德，以接替第二装甲坦克师。
