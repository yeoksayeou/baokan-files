    Qinghai Province has recently dispatched twenty-six more film projection teams to rural and pastoral areas. Now every county in the province has a film projection team. At present, the projectionists, carrying films such as "Mysterious Companion," "Summer Story," and "Dawn on the Meng River" in both Han and Tibetan languages, are starting to screen films at various projection locations according to their predetermined routes. The projectionists also frequently screen films specifically for agricultural production cooperatives.
    This year, there are already fifty-one film projection teams distributed in various counties of Qinghai Province. There is a film machinery repair and supply station specifically responsible for supplying the equipment needed by these film projection teams and carrying out repair work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    青海省电影放映队深入农村
    青海省最近增派了二十六个电影放映队到农村和牧区去，现在全省每个县都有电影放映队了。目前，携带着“神秘的旅伴”、“夏天的故事”、“猛河的黎明”等汉、藏语影片的放映队员们，正按照预定的路线，在各个放映地点开始放映。放映队员们还经常专门为农业生产合作社放映。
    今年，青海省分布在各县的电影放映队已经有五十一个。有一个电影机械修配供应站专门负责供应这些电影放映队所需要的器材和进行修配工作。　（新华社）
