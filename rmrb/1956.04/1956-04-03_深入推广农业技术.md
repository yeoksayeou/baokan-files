Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

The three thousand technical cadres from agricultural technology extension stations throughout Shandong Province have, for the most part, gone deep into large-scale agricultural production cooperatives or key point townships in counties and districts to carry out agricultural technology extension work. Combining with spring plowing production, the ninety-eight district agricultural technology extension stations in Liaocheng Prefecture have helped over one thousand one hundred cooperatives throughout the prefecture establish agricultural technology research groups (meetings), and have promoted advanced experiences such as sweet potato seedling cultivation, vernalization treatment of cotton seeds, as well as sowing, fertilization, rational close planting, and intercropping and relay intercropping to various cooperatives.
