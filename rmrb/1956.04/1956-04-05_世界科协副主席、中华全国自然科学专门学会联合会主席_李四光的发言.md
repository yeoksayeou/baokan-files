Mr. Chairman, esteemed colleagues and friends:

Please allow me, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, to extend the warmest welcome to all the distinguished guests from around the world.

We feel that our celebration today has a dual significance. Firstly, we are gathering here today to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Scientific Workers. Secondly, for the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, it is the first time we have the honor of hosting distinguished scientists from various countries, all of whom are deeply concerned about the work of this international organization.

We deeply regret that our Chairman, Professor Joliot-Curie, and Vice-Chairman, Professor Bernal, were unable to attend this commemorative conference. However, everyone knows that they have made great contributions to the development of our association in the past, constantly guiding our work, and I believe that they are with us in spirit at this moment. I also believe that the scientists who support the cause of the association but were unable to attend today are also with us in spirit.

During the Second World War, especially as the war drew to a close, science was abused in certain ways, and scientists became aware of their responsibility for the application of the results of their labor. Therefore, in 1946, the British Association of Scientific Workers invited many foreign representatives to consult, and under the active leadership of Professor Joliot-Curie, Professor Bernal, and other distinguished scientists, the World Federation of Scientific Workers was established. Since the establishment of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, Professor Joliot-Curie and Professor Bernal have made brilliant contributions to the cause of the Federation with unwavering dedication.

Therefore, at the tenth anniversary celebration of our association, I would like to pay my highest respects to both of them.

For ten years, the World Federation of Scientific Workers has been steadily developing.

In those years when the pernicious influence of the Cold War even infiltrated the most remote corners of the world and affected almost every aspect of life, when people sometimes even doubted whether man deserved the glorious title of human being, our association also encountered setbacks in its development.

It is because of the persistent and painstaking work of all our members during those years and thereafter, as well as the help of friends and supporters outside the association, especially the urgent desire of the people of the world to use the fruits of science peacefully for the benefit of mankind, that we were able to gradually overcome numerous difficulties, expand the scope of our activities, and thus consolidate the foundation of our association.

There are many reasons and some significant events that have contributed to the development of our work. If I were to cite the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which was widely disseminated through a movement by well-known scientists, and the Mainau Appeal, as examples of various reasons, I think it would not be inappropriate. We all know that our Chairman, Professor Joliot-Curie, and Professor Powell, who is presiding over our commemorative conference here today, both signed that open letter. Because people are convinced that their motives are pure and noble, this letter has had a profound impact on scientists. Needless to say, the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva was even more important. Representatives from different countries gathered there to freely exchange materials and opinions, and scientists around the world were delighted by this.

Unfortunately, a large proportion of scientists residing in various parts of the world—such as Chinese scientists—were unable to send their representatives to this conference. However, we Chinese scientists have also learned from many materials about the great achievements made at this conference. We were able to obtain these materials partly because several of our colleagues attended the conference as observers on behalf of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, and partly, and more importantly, because the Soviet government sent a scientific delegation headed by Professor Novikov to visit our country, conveying various information on the peaceful uses of atomic energy discussed at the Geneva Conference. In this way, we clearly learned about the achievements of the Geneva Conference and the atmosphere of friendship that permeated the entire conference. Although we did not have representatives attending, we fully endorsed the spirit of holding this conference and the practice of freely exchanging scientific information of paramount importance at the conference.

The prospects for the development of our association are encouraging, and the reasons are obvious, because we have happily accepted many scientific organizations from countries such as Poland, the Soviet Union, Hungary, Pakistan, Japan, and the German Democratic Republic in the past few years. With the recent addition of scientific organizations from Albania, Mongolia, and Romania to our ranks, the prospects are even more exciting.

However, these favorable conditions should not be a reason for us to relax our efforts. Today, we must see that the dark forces shrouding the political arena still threaten peace and even threaten the survival of mankind. Therefore, it is imperative for scientists around the world to act in unison. We must strengthen our organization and expand the scope of our activities to fight against these dark forces. To this end, scientists working in all departments must unite and organize to promote international exchange of scientific knowledge and mutual visits by scientists, consolidate the economic and social status of scientists, popularize useful scientific knowledge among the broad masses of people, and make science serve its noble purpose—to create more welfare for mankind.

When we observe the position of scientists and their working conditions, we will notice some prominent issues, which affect scientists in various countries to varying degrees. Many of these issues have already been stipulated in our charter, and we have made considerable efforts for these issues in the past few years. However, there are still many problems that have not been resolved. We should point out that the current conditions for exchanging scientific materials and exchanging visits by scientific workers are still far from adequate. In fact, such exchanges are even banned without any reason. This is of no benefit to anyone. The development of science clearly tells us that no matter how those foolish people try to obstruct it, scientific inventions will still spread to all parts of the world. In recent years, the number of international scientific conferences has greatly increased, which is very good. But it is important that scientists from all countries should be able to participate in the conferences. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.

We are particularly pleased to note that the organizers of the 20th International Geological Congress, scheduled to be held in Mexico in September this year, have taken steps to enable geologists from all countries to overcome possible difficulties and join the big family of international geologists. The necessary preparations made by various countries for the comprehensive work of the International Geophysical Year of 1956-1957 is another matter that deserves our active support and efforts to promote. Some countries have not yet signed cultural agreements, and their people's organizations have already done some work on scientific exchange, but in this regard, they can still make greater efforts.

The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies is ready at any time to make its greatest efforts to carry out liaison work to promote international exchanges aimed at promoting international scientific cooperation. For example, we are prepared to make the necessary arrangements to welcome foreign scientists to visit our country, or to send our own scientific delegations to visit foreign countries, and to promote the exchange of scientific information with scientific organizations in any other country.

The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies has also done a lot of work to fulfill an important responsibility, namely,
  “Ensure that science is used to help solve the major problems of the present.” Our work is in line with the large-scale construction being carried out in our country under the leadership of the People's Government. There are several prominent examples that can be used to illustrate the nature of this work. Such as controlling floods, using our own resources to develop industry, identifying medicinal materials that have been used by the Chinese people since ancient times, etc., all of which have raised a large number of problems that need to be solved by science. This requires the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, through its member organizations, to mobilize relevant scientists to participate in this work.

For example, we have found inexpensive and durable materials and appropriate methods to build a huge water gate in the middle reaches of the Yellow River near Sanmenxia and to build many smaller water gates in the upper reaches of this river. But we have not yet completely solved the complex problem of soil and water conservation, which is an important factor determining the life of the entire facility.

For example, the problem of loess and the problem of red soil are also extremely important for agricultural production. These problems cannot be handled purely from an academic point of view, as is commonly the case, but must combine scientists with the working people. In this regard, the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies has indeed done some work, but it is still too little. The Chinese Medical Association has done some useful work in studying and promoting certain traditional therapies with scientific methods. However, there are still many medical materials worth re-examining. At the same time, scientists have a responsibility to help point out which are truly effective treatments and which are merely the tricks of quack doctors.

We are gratified that our people and government trust scientists, and valuable suggestions made by the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and other such organizations are always quickly accepted. The construction now being carried out in our country is unprecedented in our country.

Under the advocacy of the People's Government and the active response of scientists across the country, we are discussing and formulating feasible plans, intending to cultivate hundreds of thousands of accomplished scientists in about twelve years to meet the needs of the people and work side by side with scientists around the world in order to better serve mankind.

I think that some of the issues I mentioned above may also exist in other countries, and solving these problems requires the collection of specialized scientific knowledge. The World Federation of Scientific Workers can do a lot of work in this regard, because it is an organization of several scientific groups in many countries.

But there are still some other unresolved issues, the solution of which depends on the current situation in different countries. For example, in some countries, the economic and social status of scientists urgently needs to be improved, and at the same time, they do not have the opportunity to actively participate in social activities. But in other countries, such as China, these kinds of problems do not exist today. Our problem is not that scientists are socially or politically despised, or that they lack material security. Rather, because the speed of development of our national construction is very fast and there are many practical problems that need to be solved, our scientific workers sometimes feel that they lack the time to engage in the research of basic theoretical problems in depth. This situation is likely to exist in other countries where construction is developing rapidly. Therefore, from the point of view of the comprehensive development of science, it seems necessary to raise it as a general problem that needs to be paid attention to in a timely manner.

Our former Secretary-General, Crowther, once aptly pointed out: Science reveals the future. So we must expand our horizons and strive for future development. I think that the current level of technological development has enabled us to seriously consider how to conduct interstellar navigation, a career containing many unknowns, as Professor Powell once mentioned in a touching tone at the Fourth Congress of the World Federation of Scientific Workers. If we want to make real progress in research and exploration in this area, then it is best to conduct planned cooperation on a global scale, rather than relying solely on radio observers to occasionally encounter an unidentified comet tail, or relying solely on a few lonely rockets occasionally launched from certain corners of the world. For this reason, a worldwide plan is clearly urgently needed.

The endless possibilities of interstellar travel may become a reality in the near future, and this imagination is encouraging, but at the same time, we must not forget that there are still many aspects of people's lives on Earth that need to be improved. Many major scientific measures related to the entire human life should be brought to the attention of organizations such as the World Federation of Scientific Workers for timely discussion. Dr. Josué de Castro is editing the first issue of "Science and Mankind," a special issue on the world food problem, which is a significant example. In addition, if we consider the problem of the rational use of various precious materials with limited reserves on the earth, then similar plans seem feasible. Without having to indulge in fantasies, it can be predicted that our descendants will blame us scientists for turning a blind eye and remaining silent while precious materials like coal are casually burned as fuel, especially for us engineers, now that we have entered an era of using atomic energy instead of ordinary fuel. In addition, although the world's reserves of uranium and thorium can be used for thousands of years, we have no reason to allow these precious materials to be wasted by being made into bombs that are harmful to mankind and have no benefit. The above examples are enough to illustrate the nature of this type of problem.

I have said a lot about the prospects for our work, but it all depends on whether a key issue can be satisfactorily resolved, that is, whether we can obtain peace—lasting peace. History proves that peace will not fall from the sky, and we must mobilize all possible forces to defend peace. In particular, because scientists around the world work according to common principles, according to common methods, and on the basis of a common scientific heritage, they are inherently closely united. Racial differences, social status, political systems, and economic conditions cannot affect these commonalities between them. Therefore, they should serve as the main pillars in uniting this world that is temporarily divided by violence.

Given the fact that nuclear weapons were invented after a considerable period of intensive scientific research, scientists who are concerned about world peace should realize that they have a greater responsibility in condemning the use of such weapons.

As a well-known Soviet scholar, my colleague, Academician V.I. Vernadsky, said well: "Scientists must not turn a blind eye to the consequences of their research and scientific development. They must be responsible for the consequences of their inventions."

Now that scientists have discovered how to master various fissile materials and release powerful forces from nuclear structures, they have a responsibility to ensure that these materials are used, and only used, for the benefit of mankind. Our World Federation of Scientific Workers was established for such a noble purpose. At this solemn moment of the tenth anniversary of the founding of our World Federation of Scientific Workers, we should act in unison and demand a ban on the use of any type of nuclear weapon.

We should also remember that when the volcano Krakatoa erupted in 1883, there was still dust floating over Europe three years later, and the cumulative toxic effects of some long-lived radioactive isotopes have not yet been determined. Therefore, we must unite and loudly demand a stop to the testing of such weapons, so as not to cause irreparable damage. I believe that as long as we unite and fight for our noble cause, we will surely win.

专栏：

    世界科协副主席、中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会主席
    李四光的发言主席先生、各位敬爱的同事和朋友：
    请允许我代表中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会向各位来自世界各地的贵宾们表示最热烈的欢迎。
    我们感觉到，今天我们举行庆祝是有双重意义的。因为，首先我们今天在这里集会，是为了纪念世界科学工作者协会成立十周年。其次，对中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会来说还是第一次享有接待各国杰出科学家的荣幸，这些位杰出的科学家都是对这个世界性组织的工作非常关怀的。
    我们深深感到遗憾，我们的主席约里奥—居里教授和副主席贝尔纳教授没有能够参加这次纪念大会。但是，大家都知道，他们两位在过去对我们协会的发展作出了很大的贡献，不断地指导了我们的工作，我相信在这个时候他们在精神上是和我们在一起的。我也同样相信今天没有能够出席的、支持协会事业的各位科学家在精神上也是和我们在一起的。
    在第二次世界大战期间，特别在战争接近结束时，科学在某些方面遭到滥用，科学家由此觉悟到他们对自己劳动的成果的应用负有责任。因此，1946年英国科学工作者协会邀请了许多外国代表协商，在约里奥—居里教授、贝尔纳教授和其他杰出的科学家的积极领导之下成立了世界科协。世界科协成立以来，约里奥—居里教授和贝尔纳教授一直以坚持不懈的精神，为科协的事业作出了光辉的贡献。
    所以在我们协会成立十周年的纪念会上，我谨向他们两位致以崇高的敬意。
    十年来，世界科学工作者协会是一直在稳步地向前发展的。
    在冷战的恶劣影响甚至侵袭到世界最偏僻的地方并且几乎影响到生活的各方面的那些年月里，当人们有时甚至怀疑人是否配称为人这一光荣称号的时候，我们的协会也在它的发展过程中遭到了挫折。
    由于我们各位会员在那些年月中和以后坚持不懈地一点一滴地进行工作，以及会外朋友和支持者的帮助，尤其是世界人民对和平利用科学的成果为人类谋福利的迫切愿望，我们才得以逐渐突破重重困难，扩大我们的活动范围，从而巩固了我们协会的基础。
    有许多原因和某些意义重大的事件是有助于我们工作的发展的。如果我把由于知名的科学家们的一种运动而得以广泛传播的罗素—爱因斯坦信件和麦劳呼吁，作为各种原因的一个例子提出的话，我想不是不恰当的。我们都知道，我们协会的主席约里奥—居里教授和今天在这里主持我们这个纪念大会的鲍威尔教授，在那个公开的信件上都签了名。因为人们都深信他们的动机是纯洁的、崇高的，因此，这个信件在科学家中的影响是很深远的。不待说，更重要的是日内瓦和平利用原子能国际会议。在那里不同国家的代表聚集一堂自由地交换材料和意见，全世界的科学家都为此感到庆幸。
    遗憾的是居住在世界各地的很大的一部分科学工作者——例如中国的科学工作者，却不能派遣自己的代表出席这次会议。但是，我们中国科学工作者从许多材料里也知道了这次会议上所取得的伟大成就。我们之所以能获得这许多材料，一方面是由于我们的几位同事作为世界科学工作者协会的代表以观察员身份出席了这次会议，另一方面，也就是主要的一方面，是苏联政府派遣以诺维科夫教授为首的科学代表团访问我国，传达有关日内瓦会议上讨论的和平利用原子能问题的各种资料。就是这样，我们才清楚地知道日内瓦会议的成就以及贯穿在整个会议中的友谊气氛。虽然我们没有代表参加，但是我们完全赞成召开这次会议的精神以及在会上自由交换具有无上重要性的科学资料这种作法。
    我们协会发展的远景是振奋人心的，理由很明显，因为过去几年来我们愉快地接纳了波兰、苏联、匈牙利、巴基斯坦、日本、德意志民主共和国等国家的许多科学团体。由于阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古和罗马尼亚等国的科学团体最近加入了我们的行列，前景就更加令人兴奋。
    然而，这些有利情况不应成为我们放松努力的原因。今天，我们必须看到笼罩着政治领域的黑暗势力仍然威胁着和平甚至威胁着人类生存。因此，全世界科学家一致行动起来是迫不及待的。我们就必须加强我们的组织和扩大我们活动的范围，来和这种黑暗势力进行斗争。为此，在一切部门内工作的科学家都必须团结和组织起来，促进国际间科学知识的交流和科学家的相互访问，巩固科学家的经济和社会地位，向广大人民群众普及有用的科学知识，并使科学服务于自己的崇高目的——为人类谋更多的福利。
    当我们观察一下科学家所处的地位和他们的工作条件时，我们会注意到一些突出的问题，这些问题同样或多或少地影响到各国的科学家。其中很多问题已经在我们的宪章上有了规定，过去几年来，我们为这些问题也作了不少努力。但是仍旧有很多问题尚未解决。我们应该指出，目前，交流科学材料和互派科学工作者访问的条件还很不够。事实上，这种交流甚至毫无理由地被禁止了。这是对任何人都没有益处的。科学的发展很清楚地告诉我们，无论那些愚蠢的人们企图怎样来阻挠它，科学发明仍旧会流传到世界各地。近几年来，国际间的科学会议大大增多了，这是很好的。但重要的是，应该使各国的科学家都能参加会议。很不幸，事实并不总是这样。
    我们特别高兴地注意到，预定于今年九月在墨西哥举行的第二十届国际地质学会议的组织者采取了步骤，使各国的地质学家都能够排除可能遇到的困难，而得以参加国际地质学家的大家庭。为了在1956—1957年国际地球物理年的综合工作，各国进行了必要的筹备，这又是一个值得我们积极支持与努力促进的事情。有些国家之间尚未签订文化协定，它们的人民团体已经作了一些科学交流的工作，但在这方面，它们还可以尽更多的努力。
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会随时准备尽自己最大的努力进行联络工作，以促进其目的在于推进国际科学合作的国际交流。比如，我们准备作必要的安排，欢迎外国科学家访问我国，或者派遣我们自己的科学团体出国访问，并促进和任何别的国家的科学团体交流科学资料。
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会还作了很多工作，以履行一项重要职责，即
  “保证将科学运用于帮助解决当前的重大问题”。我们的工作是与我国在人民政府领导下进行的大规模建设相配合的。有几个突出的例子可以用来说明这种工作的性质。如治理洪水、利用我国自己的资源发展工业、鉴定自远古以来中国人民相沿使用的药材等等，所有这些都提出了大量需要用科学来解决的问题。这就要靠中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会通过它的会员组织，动员有关的科学家参加这项工作。
    例如，我们已找到廉价而耐久的材料和适当的方法在黄河中游靠近三门峡的地方修建一个巨大的水闸并在这条河的上游修建许多较小的水闸。但是我们尚未完全解决水土保持这个复杂的问题，而这一问题是决定整个设施的寿命的一个重要因素。
    又如，黄土问题及红壤问题对于农业生产也是极为重要的，这些问题不能像常见的那样单纯从学术观点来处理，而必须使科学家与劳动人民相结合。在这方面，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会固然作了一些工作，但还嫌太少。中华医学会已在用科学方法研究和推广某些传统治疗法方面作了一些有益的工作。然而，还有很多医学材料值得重新审查。同时科学家有责任协助指出哪些是真正有效的治疗方法，哪些仅仅是江湖医生的骗人术。
    我们的人民及政府对科学家的信任是我们感到庆幸的，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会以及其他这样的组织所提出的有价值的建议总是很快地就被接受。现在我国进行的建设其规模在我国是史无前例的。
    在人民政府倡导和全国科学家的积极响应下，我们正在讨论与制定切实可行的规划，打算大约在十二年的时间内使我们能够造就几十万有成就的科学家，来适应人民的需要并且和全世界的科学家并肩地努力，以便更好地为人类服务。
    我想我在上面提到的这样一些问题在别的国家也可能存在，要解决这些问题就需要汇集专门的科学知识。世界科学工作者协会在这方面能够作很多工作，因为它就是许多国家的若干科学团体的组织。
    但是还存在一些别的尚未明确的问题，它们的解决要由不同国家的现状来决定。例如，在有些国家里，科学家的经济与社会地位迫切需要改善，同时他们得不到积极参加社会活动的机会。但在其他国家，例如中国，这类问题今天是不存在的。我们的问题不是说科学家在社会上或政治上受到轻视，或者缺乏物质上的保障。而是因为我们国家建设事业发展的速度很快，需要解决的实际问题很多，因而我们的科学工作者有时感到缺乏时间，深入地从事于研究基本性的理论问题，这种情况在其他建设事业发展很快的国家中，想来是可能存在的，因此，从全面发展科学的观点来说，似乎是有必要作为需要及时注意的一个一般性的问题提出来。
    我们的前任秘书长克劳瑟曾经恰当地指出过：科学揭示未来。所以我们一定要扩大我们的眼界，为了未来的发展而努力。我认为，我们当代的技术发展水平已使我们能像鲍威尔教授在世界科协第四届大会上曾以动人的口气提到的那样，认真考虑如何进行星际航行这一句含着许多未知数的事业。如果想使这方面的研究和探险工作真正有所进展，那么最好是在全球范围内进行有计划的合作，而不是仅仅依靠无线电观察器偶尔碰到一个来去不明的彗星尾巴，或者仅仅依靠从世界的某几个角落里偶尔射出几支孤零零的火箭。为此，一个全世界范围的计划显而易见是亟需的。
    星际旅行的无穷尽的可能性也许在不久的将来可能成为事实，这种想像是令人鼓舞的，但同时我们不能忘记人们在地球上的生活还有许多方面有待改进。有许多重大的有关整个人类生活的科学措施应该引起像世界科协这样的组织来加以注意和及时探讨。约索·卡斯特洛博士正在编辑“科学与人类”第一期世界粮食问题专号，就是一个显著的例子。此外，如果我们考虑到合理使用地球上的储量有限的各种贵重物资这类问题时，那末，类似的计划看来也是可行的。用不着想入非非就可以预料到，将来我们的子孙会责难我们科学家，为什么眼看着像煤这样贵重的物质被随便当作燃料烧掉而默不作声，尤其，对我们工程师来说，现在已进入用原子能代替普通燃料的时代了。此外，世界上储存的铀和钍，尽管可以使用几千年，但我们没有任何理由让这些贵重物质被作成对人类有百害而无一利的炸弹而浪费掉。以上这些例子足够说明这类问题的性质。
    我说了不少有关我们工作的前景，但是，这全在于一个关键问题能不能得到圆满的解决，就是，我们能不能得到和平——持久的和平。历史证明：和平不会自天而降，我们必须动员一切可能动员的力量来保卫和平。特别是，由于全世界科学家都根据共同的原则按照共同的方法和在共同的科学遗产的基础上进行劳动，他们本来是紧密地团结在一起的。种族差别、社会地位、政治制度和经济状况都不能影响他们之间的这一些共同之点。因此，他们应该在团结这个暂时为暴力所分裂的世界中充当主要的支柱。
    鉴于核子武器是经过相当时期的紧张的科学研究工作才发明出来的这一事实，关心世界和平的科学家就应该意识到，在谴责使用这类武器方面自己负有更大的责任。
    一位知名的苏联学者，我的同行，维·伊·瓦纳特斯基院士说的好：“科学家决不能对他们的研究及科学发展可能造成的结果熟视无睹。他们必须对其发明的后果负责。”
    现在，科学家已经发现了掌握多种可分裂的物质以及从核子结构中释放出强大力量的方法，因此他们有责任使这些物质被用来，而且仅仅被用来造福于人类。我们世界科协之所以建立就是为了这样的崇高目的。在我们世界科协成立十周年纪念这一庄严的时刻，我们应该一致行动起来，要求禁止使用任何类型的核子武器。
    我们还应该记得克拉卡土拉的火山在1883年爆发，三年之后还有尘土在欧洲上空飘荡，而且有些作用期限较长的放射性同位素的积蓄性的有毒的效果尚未确定，因而，我们必须团结一致，大声疾呼地要求停止试验这类武器，以免造成不可弥补的损失。我相信只要我们团结起来，为我们高尚的事业而斗争，我们必定获得胜利。
