This Year All Counties and Cities Nationwide Can Access Long-Distance Telephone or Telegraph Services

This year, all counties (cities) in the country can have access to long-distance telephone or telegraph services. Post and telecommunications offices with switchboards already installed in areas below the county level (or central townships) will also gradually develop telegraph or long-distance telephone services. This is the plan made at the Fifth National Postal and Telecommunications Work Conference.

By the end of last year, the country's long-distance telecommunications lines had more than doubled compared to 1949, and a national postal and telecommunications network with Beijing as its center had been basically completed. However, in peripheral areas or minority nationality areas, there are still one hundred and fifty counties that cannot access long-distance telephone services and fifty-three counties that cannot access telegraph services. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has decided that all counties with existing lines will open telegraph and telephone services in the second quarter; counties that have already planned to erect lines this year are required to complete the line erection task according to the plan and start making calls. Counties that cannot erect lines this year will install wireless telegraph and telephone machines to ensure that all counties have access to long-distance telephone or telegraph services.

    今年全国各县市可通长途电话或电报
    今年全国所有的县（市）都可以通长途电话或电报，县以下区（或中心乡）所在地已经装置交换机的邮电所，也要逐步开展电报或长途电话业务。这是第五次全国邮电工作会议上作出的规划。
    到去年年底，全国长途电信线路已经比1949年增长了一倍多，基本上建成了以北京为中心的全国邮电通信网。但是，在边沿地区或少数民族地区，还有一百五十个县不能通长途电话，有五十三个县不通电报。邮电部决定现在已经有线路通达的县，第二季度内全部开放报、话业务；已经计划在今年架设线路的县，要求按计划完成架线任务，并且开始通话。今年不能架设线路的县，装置无线报话机，以保证做到县县通长途电话或电报。
