Don't Lose the Watermelon Trying to Pick Up Sesame Seeds
Gao Changren

In a few areas of Hunan Province, district and township workers, in pursuit of thousand-jin yield figures, are inappropriately squeezing out many low-cost, high-value crops in their plans. They narrowly understand that to achieve a thousand-jin yield, they can only plant double-cropping rice and potatoes and other high-yield crops, and that other crops cannot be planted. The Meiqi Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangtan County originally planned to expand the planting of double-cropping rice by 5,040 mu. This plan included ten mu of lotus root fields and more than seventy mu of taro fields, which were not suitable for double cropping. In fact, the output value per mu of taro fields exceeds that of rice by more than six times. Moreover, planting so much double-cropping rice presents difficulties in terms of labor and capital. The cooperative members were dissatisfied with this plan, and they criticized it as "losing the watermelon trying to pick up sesame seeds." Similar situations exist in the Nanyue District of Hengshan County. This district originally had more than 8,000 mu of soybeans. The masses have the habit of replanting soybeans. Soybeans are also the raw material for making tofu in local towns and cities, and sales are very good. However, in order to achieve a thousand-jin yield, district and township cadres plan to convert all of these more than 8,000 mu of soybean fields to replanting autumn potatoes, and the masses are also dissatisfied with this plan.

Recently, both of these regions have reversed this situation. The Meiqi Agricultural Cooperative has appropriately modified its plan based on natural conditions, capital, and labor. The double-cropping rice area has been reduced to 4,500 mu, and the taro fields and lotus root fields are still preserved and appropriately expanded. They also plan to replant eight mu of water chestnuts in ten mu of lotus root fields. After the plan was revised, the total labor days required by the cooperative decreased from the original 250,000 to more than 230,000; the total income of the cooperative increased from the original 610,000 yuan to more than 660,000 yuan; and the cost was reduced by more than 4,700 yuan compared to the original plan. Due to the development of various crops in accordance with local conditions, labor is easier to allocate, and people can be freed up to engage in sideline occupations. Moreover, due to the development of diversified operations, the cooperative can have monthly income, and members living in poverty can pre-draw part of the cash from the cooperative to solve their immediate living problems.

In the course of carrying out the thousand-jin yield movement, it is necessary for agricultural production cooperatives to actively promote various high-yield crops and increase the multiple cropping index. Both of these methods are currently the main ways to increase production, and it would be wrong for anyone to ignore these methods. However, even so, we cannot regard these two methods as the only ways to increase production. As mentioned above, in order to expand the planting area of double-cropping rice, even lotus root fields and taro fields that are more valuable than rice are abandoned, and the soybeans needed by the masses are not planted. This is like the masses say: "losing the watermelon trying to pick up sesame seeds." This phenomenon is not an isolated case. It exists not only in Hunan but also in other regions. This is worthy of attention by the leading organs in various places.

    不要丢了西瓜拣芝麻
    高长任
    湖南省有少数地区的区、乡工作人员，为了追求千斤丰产的数字，在计划中不适当地挤掉很多成本低、价值大的农作物。他们狭隘地理解要千斤丰产就只能种双季稻和马铃薯等高产作物，其他的作物就不能种了。湘潭县梅琪农业合作社原来计划扩种双季稻五千零四十亩，这个计划把不宜于种双季的十亩藕田和七十多亩芋头田都包括在内。实际上，芋头田每亩的产值超过稻谷的六倍。而且种那么多的双季稻在劳力、资金上都是有困难的。社员不满意这个计划，他们批评说这是“丢了西瓜拣芝麻”。衡山县南岳区也有类似的情况。这个区原来有八千多亩黄豆，群众有复种黄豆的习惯，黄豆也是当地集镇和城市做豆腐的原料，销路很好。可是区、乡干部为了达到千斤丰产，却打算把这八千多亩黄豆田全部改为复种秋马铃薯，群众对这个计划也不满意。
    最近，这两个地区都已扭转了这种情况。梅琪农业社已根据自然条件、资金和劳动力的情况，适当修改了计划。把双季稻面积缩减为四千五百亩，芋头田、藕田仍然保存并适当加以扩大。他们还打算十亩藕田里复种八亩荸荠。计划经过修改之后，全社所需劳动日由原来的二十五万个降低到二十三万多个；全社总收入则由原计划的六十一万多元增加到六十六万多元；成本则比原计划减少了四千七百多元。由于因地制宜地发展各种农作物，劳动力好调配了，还可抽出人来搞副业。并且，由于开展多种经营，社里可以月月有收入，生活贫困的社员可以在社里预支到部分现钱，解决眼前的生活问题。
    农业生产合作社在开展千斤丰产运动中，积极地提倡多种高产作物、增加复种指数是必要的。这两种办法都是目前主要的增产办法，谁要忽视这些办法那就是错误的。但是，虽然如此，我们也不能把这两种办法看成是唯一增产的办法。像上面说的为了扩大双季稻播种面积，连比稻谷价值高的藕田、芋头也不要了，群众需要的黄豆也不种了，那就是像群众说的：“丢了西瓜拣芝麻。”目前这种现象并不是个别的，不仅湖南有，别的地区也有，这是值得各地领导机关注意的。
