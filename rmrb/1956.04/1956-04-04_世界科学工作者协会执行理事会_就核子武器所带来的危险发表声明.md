The world's leading scientists issued a special statement here this afternoon at a press conference on the dangers posed by nuclear weapons.

Professor Powell of the University of Bristol, England, a Nobel Prize winner, presided over the press conference.

The full text of the statement formally issued by the Executive Council of the World Federation of Scientific Workers is as follows:

    The World Federation of Scientific Workers, like many other organizations and many individual scientific workers (including some scientific workers who speak with great authority), has repeatedly drawn attention to the dangers of continued production, stockpiling and testing of nuclear weapons.

    It believes that this danger can only be eliminated by the conclusion of a comprehensive disarmament agreement by the major powers and the declaration of such weapons as illegal. The Sixteenth Session of the Executive Council of the World Federation of Scientific Workers therefore welcomes the continuation of discussions by the United Nations General Assembly Disarmament Commission. It calls on all the countries participating in the discussions to make the greatest effort to reach agreement on the outstanding issues so as to free mankind from the terrible threat of mass destruction, to which the whole world will continue to be exposed until such an agreement is implemented.

    At the same time, nuclear weapons tests are continuing in some countries, despite the serious damage caused by the results of previous tests, despite the increase in radioactive products in the atmosphere with each new test explosion, and despite the unknown extent of genetic damage to future generations. We therefore stress the urgent need to conclude an international convention banning all further testing of atomic and thermonuclear weapons. We firmly believe that an immediate ban on nuclear weapons testing is entirely feasible, as there are no technical difficulties in detecting such weapons testing.

    In the present serious situation, we call upon scientists in all countries to speak out with greater determination against the continued production, stockpiling and testing of these weapons, so that this vast new source of energy obtained by mankind from harnessing the power of the atomic nucleus is used entirely for peaceful purposes and to increase the wealth and happiness of all mankind.

    世界科学工作者协会执行理事会
    就核子武器所带来的危险发表声明
    新华社3日讯　世界著名的科学家们今天下午在这里举行的记者招待会上就核子武器所带来的危险发表了一项特别声明。
    英国布利斯托尔大学教授、诺贝尔奖金获得人鲍威尔教授主持了记者招待会。
    世界科学工作者协会执行理事会正式发表的声明全文如下：
    世界科学工作者协会同许多其他组织和许多各别的科学工作者
  （包括一些发言极有权威的科学工作者）一样，曾经多次提请大家注意继续生产、储存、试验性爆炸核子武器所带来的危险。
    它认为这种危险只有由大国缔结一项全面裁军协议和宣布这种武器为非法才能消灭。世界科学工作者协会执行理事会第十六届会议因此欢迎联合国大会裁军委员会继续进行讨论。它要求所有参加讨论的国家作一次最大的努力，就悬而未决的问题达成协议，以使人类摆脱大规模毁灭的可怕威胁，而在这种协议实施之前，全世界将继续受到这种威胁。
    同时，某些国家的核子武器试验仍在继续进行，尽管由于以前历次试验的结果造成了严重的损害，尽管大气中放射性产物随每次新的试验性爆炸有了增加，而且给后代子孙带来的遗传上的损害程度还没有人知道。因此，我们强调必须立即缔结一项禁止再进行一切原子和热核子武器试验的国际公约。我们坚决认为，立即禁止核子武器试验是完全切实可行的，因为测查这种武器的试验并不存在技术上的困难。
    在目前严重的局势下，我们号召一切国家中的科学家们以更大的决心大声疾呼反对继续生产、储存和试验这些武器，以使人类掌握原子核力量而得到的这个巨大的能的新泉源完全用于和平目的，并且增进全体人类的财富和幸福。
