Surrendering to the Authorities is the Only Way Out for Counter-Revolutionaries

The Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court has leniently treated Kuomintang secret agent Zhang Yi, who surrendered to the authorities, confessed his crimes, and performed meritorious service: exempting him from criminal punishment, providing him with certain material rewards, and recommending that relevant departments appropriately arrange employment for him. This specifically embodies the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, offsetting crimes with meritorious service, and rewarding great achievements."

The path of surrender and confession taken by Zhang Yi is the only path that all counter-revolutionaries should choose.

Zhang Yi was a historical counter-revolutionary with serious crimes, and also an important current secret agent sent in by the intelligence agencies. Such a counter-revolutionary would originally have been severely punished by the law. However, because Zhang Yi chose the path of surrendering to the authorities and atoning for his crimes with meritorious service, he received lenient treatment. In recent times, the phenomenon of counter-revolutionaries voluntarily surrendering to the authorities like Zhang Yi is not an isolated one. Since last autumn, especially after the arrival of the national socialist high tide and after the promulgation of the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967," counter-revolutionaries of all sizes in various places have surrendered to the authorities one after another, and many counter-revolutionaries who had been hiding for many years and very cleverly have also voluntarily come out to surrender. Among those who have surrendered, there are also many counter-revolutionaries who historically owed blood debts and secret agents sent in by the US-Chiang Kai-shek intelligence agencies. Because they chose the path of sincere repentance and atoning for their crimes with meritorious service, they have all received lenient treatment. Naturally, during the same period, some counter-revolutionaries were still found to be continuing to carry out sabotage activities. These counter-revolutionaries who are enemies of the people, if they stubbornly refuse to confess, persist in their counter-revolutionary stance, and continue to be enemies of the people, will certainly be severely punished by the law. All counter-revolutionaries should see this point as soon as possible. As long as they can sincerely confess and repent, even if their crimes are serious, they will certainly receive lenient treatment from the state, and as long as they confess thoroughly and make meritorious contributions, they can not only obtain a reduction of sentence or exemption from punishment, but also be given the opportunity to participate in production or work. Zhang Yi and many counter-revolutionaries who have surrendered are their precedents.

The large-scale voluntary surrender of counter-revolutionaries is a new situation. This fact shows that many counter-revolutionaries who were relatively firm in the past have now completely shattered their illusions about the restoration of counter-revolutionary rule. Take Zhang Yi as an example. He was originally a veteran secret agent of the US-Chiang Kai-shek intelligence agencies. In the past, he served the Chiang Kai-shek clique wholeheartedly, and he had great illusions about the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. However, why did he surrender to the People's Government not long after his most recent infiltration into the mainland? Zhang Yi said very clearly when he surrendered that "relying on the United States and Chiang Kai-shek is unreliable." Why "unreliable"? Because the peace, democracy and socialism camp is becoming increasingly powerful, the imperialist aggressive forces are becoming increasingly weaker, the criminal activities of the US aggressive clique in preparing for war and creating international tension have been universally resented and opposed by the people of the world, and have therefore encountered setbacks everywhere, and the US-supported Chiang Kai-shek clique's "counterattack on the mainland" and conspiracy to "restore" have been thoroughly shattered because of the increasing strength of our national defense. Moreover, one day, Taiwan will be liberated. Many counter-revolutionaries are now beginning to recognize this point: the future of the US aggressive clique is bleak, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is even more hopeless, while New China is thriving and showing an infinitely bright prospect. After entering the mainland, Zhang Yi clearly recognized this fact. He was unwilling to stake his fate on the criminal conspiracies of the US aggressive clique and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Therefore, he decided his own fate and chose the path of surrendering to the people of the motherland.

From the process of Zhang Yi's surrender, we can also see the fact that it has become increasingly difficult for counter-revolutionaries to continue to hide and continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. After Zhang Yi sneaked into the mainland from Hong Kong, he initially attempted to find various opportunities to collect intelligence and attempted to use his past social connections to cover up his espionage activities. But what was the result? Whether it was the strange ordinary soldiers and ordinary workers he met on the train, whether it was the familiar old "friends" and ordinary women he met in Hangzhou and other places, even the primary school students studying in the school, all held a very vigilant attitude towards him. This revolutionary vigilance of the masses constitutes the real copper wall and iron bastion for our people to prevent counter-revolutionary sabotage, making even an old secret agent like Zhang Yi, who had been engaged in espionage activities for a long time, inevitably completely isolated and exposed, and finally had to surrender to the People's Government. This situation is by no means accidental. The socialist transformation and socialist construction are achieving great victories, the level of consciousness and organization of the people is being further improved, and 600 million people are building their own peaceful and happy life with selfless labor. Under these circumstances, the people will never tolerate counter-revolutionaries continuing to hide and carry out sabotage. Especially after several years of tempering and education in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the people's experience in identifying and defeating enemies has become richer. Now, if any counter-revolutionary attempts to continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, he will inevitably fall into the hands of the people sooner or later, and he will inevitably be severely punished by the law sooner or later. Therefore, all counter-revolutionaries cannot have any other way out except for the path of surrendering to the authorities.

Now, our great motherland has undergone fundamental changes. Construction is booming, and people's lives are improving day by day. Under these circumstances, any counter-revolutionary, as long as he has a little reason, cannot but consider his own future: is it better to be an enemy of the motherland and the people and thus enter a shameful dead end, or to immediately surrender to the authorities, make a new start, and enter socialist society with the people of the motherland? There is no doubt that surrendering to the authorities and making a new start is the best way out for counter-revolutionaries. All counter-revolutionaries who have not yet surrendered should think carefully, should decide their own destiny, arouse their patriotic conscience, break through their concerns, and surrender to the authorities. We repeat: the policy of the People's Government towards counter-revolutionaries has always been a policy that combines suppression and leniency, that is, those who sincerely repent and surrender to the authorities will definitely receive lenient treatment of reduced or exempted punishment; those who resist confession and continue to do evil will definitely be severely punished by the law. Socialism is advancing, and the people of the motherland are advancing. For those who originally stood in an antagonistic position, their best way out is to raise their hands, surrender to the people, and surrender! The people will forgive them, and they will have a new life and a new future. This is the best way out for them.

### 自动投案是反革命分子的唯一出路

    自动投案是反革命分子的唯一出路
    杭州市中级人民法院对于自动投案自首、并且有立功表现的国民党特务分子张毅实行宽大处理：免予刑事处分，并且给予一定的物质奖励，建议有关部门适当安置工作。这具体地体现了“坦白从宽，抗拒从严，立功折罪，立大功受奖”的政策。
    张毅所走的自首投案的道路，是一切反革命分子应该选择的唯一道路。
    张毅是一个有严重罪行的历史反革命分子，又是一个被特务机关派遣进来的重要现行特务分子。这样的反革命分子，本来是应当受到国法的严厉惩办的。但是由于张毅选择了自首投案、立功赎罪的道路，所以获得了宽大处理。像张毅这样自动投案自首的反革命分子，在近来并不是个别的现象。从去年秋季以来，特别是在全国社会主义高潮到来以后和在“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”公布以后，各地都有大大小小的反革命分子纷纷自动投案自首，而且有不少隐藏多年、隐藏得很巧妙的反革命分子也自动出来投案自首了。在投案自首的分子中，也有许多是历史上负有血债的反革命分子和美蒋特务机关派遣进来的特务分子。因为他们选择了真诚悔过、立功赎罪的道路，所以都获得了宽大处理。自然，在同一时期也还发现一些反革命分子在继续进行破坏活动。这些与人民为敌的反革命分子，如果硬是拒不坦白，坚持反革命立场，继续与人民为敌，就一定要受到国法的严厉惩处。一切反革命分子都应该尽快看到这一点。只要他们能够真诚坦白，悔过自新，那怕就是罪恶严重的，也一定会得到国家的宽大处理，并且只要坦白的彻底，立有功劳，不仅可以获得减刑或者免予处刑，而且还给以参加生产或工作的机会。张毅和许多自首了的反革命分子就是他们的先例。
    大批的反革命分子自动投案，是一个新的情况。这个事实说明：很多过去比较坚决的反革命分子，现在对于自己所寄托的反革命统治复辟的幻想已经彻底破灭了。就以张毅来说，他本来是一个美蒋特务机关的老牌特务分子。过去，他死心踏地为蒋介石集团服务，他对蒋介石集团的复辟曾经抱着很大的幻想。可是，他为什么在最近一次潜入大陆以后不久，就向人民政府自首了呢？张毅在自首的时候说得很清楚，就是“靠美国靠蒋介石靠不住了”。为什么“靠不住了”呢？因为和平民主社会主义阵营日益强大，帝国主义侵略势力日益削弱，美国侵略集团准备战争和制造国际紧张局势的罪恶活动，遭到了世界人民的普遍愤恨和反对，因而到处碰壁，而美国所支持的蒋介石集团的“反攻大陆”，阴谋“复辟”的幻想，更因为我国国防威力的日益强大而彻头彻尾地破灭了。而且，总有一天，台湾是会被解放的。现在许多反革命分子都开始认识到这样一点：美国侵略集团的前途是暗淡的，蒋介石集团更是毫无希望的，而新中国却是欣欣向荣，展现出无限光明的远景。张毅在进入大陆以后，更清楚地认识到这个事实，他不愿意拿自己的命运去为美国侵略集团和蒋介石集团的罪恶阴谋作赌注，因此，他决定了自己的命运，选择了向祖国人民自首投案的道路。
    从张毅自首的过程中，还可以看到这样一个事实：反革命分子企图继续隐藏下去，企图继续进行反革命活动，已经越来越困难了。张毅从香港混进大陆以后，他最初还企图找各种机会收集情报，企图利用他过去的社会关系掩护起来进行特务活动。可是结果怎样呢？不论他是在火车上遇见的陌生的普通战士和普通工人，不论是他在杭州等地见到的熟识的老“朋友”和普通妇女，甚至在学校读书的小学生，都对他抱着一种十分警惕的态度。这种群众的革命警惕性，构成了我国人民防止反革命破坏的真正的铜墙铁壁，使张毅这样一个长期进行特务活动的老特务分子也不免完全陷于孤立而暴露出来，最后不得不向人民政府投案自首。这种情况决不是偶然发生的。社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业正在取得伟大胜利，人民群众的觉悟程度和组织程度正在进一步提高，六万万人民正在以忘我的劳动建设着自己的和平和美好的幸福生活。在这种情况之下，人民决不能容忍反革命分子继续隐藏和进行破坏。尤其是在经过了几年来镇压反革命斗争的锻炼和教育以后，人民群众识别敌人和战胜敌人的经验更加丰富了。现在任何一个反革命分子如果企图再继续进行反革命活动，他迟早必然会要落到人民群众的手里，迟早必然会受到国法的严厉惩办。因此，一切反革命分子除了投案自首的道路以外，不可能有另外的任何生路。
    现在，我们伟大的祖国已经发生了根本的变化。建设事业蓬勃发展，人民生活日益改善，在这种情况下，任何一个反革命分子，只要他稍有理智，他就不能不考虑自己的前途：是同祖国和人民为敌因而走入可耻的死路好呢，还是立即投案自首、重作新人，随着祖国人民走进社会主义社会好呢？毫无疑问，投案自首、重作新人是反革命分子最好的道路。一切尚未投案自首的反革命分子都应该好好想一想，都应该自己决定自己的命运，激发自己的爱国的良心，打破顾虑，投案自首。我们再重复一遍：人民政府对待反革命分子的政策，从来就是镇压与宽大相结合的政策，即真诚悔改、投案自首的一定可以获得减刑或者免刑的宽大处理；抗拒坦白、继续作恶的一定受到国法的严厉制裁。社会主义在前进，祖国人民在前进。原来站在敌对地位的人们，他们最好的出路就是举起手来，向人民缴械，投降！人民将宽恕他们，他们将获得新的生活和新的前途。这对于他们是一条最好的出路。
