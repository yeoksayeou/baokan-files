The primary task of provincial publishing houses in general will be to focus on the countryside and publish popular reading materials aimed at the broad masses of peasants and township and commune cadres to meet the growing cultural needs of rural readers. This was the opinion put forward at a symposium on provincial local publishing houses held in Beijing by the Publishing Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture.

The symposium believed that people's publishing houses in general provinces should focus on several main aspects of popular reading materials for farmers, namely: works that provide a popular explanation of Marxism-Leninism, readings that explain the Party's policies (especially policies on agricultural cooperation and agricultural production), science and technology readings (especially agricultural production technology knowledge), and cultural and educational (including literacy) readings, and carry out long-term book publishing plans.

The symposium also believed that provincial people's publishing houses should unite and cultivate local writing forces, so that local publishing houses can become a garden for local writers to publish works beneficial to the people.

    省出版社的首要任务是面向农村出版通俗读物
    一般省的出版社今后的首要任务将是面向农村，出版以广大农民和乡、社干部为主要对象的通俗读物，以满足农村读者日益增长的文化需要。这是文化部出版事业管理局在北京召开的省级地方出版社座谈会上提出的意见。
    座谈会认为一般省的人民出版社应该抓住农民通俗读物的几个主要方面，即：通俗讲解马克思列宁主义的著作，解释党的政策（特别是农业合作化和农业生产的政策）的读物，科学技术（特别是农业生产技术知识）读物和文化教育（包括扫盲）读物，进行长期的出书规划。
    座谈会并且认为省人民出版社应该团结和培养地方写作力量，让地方出版社成为地方作家出版有益于人民的著作的园地。
