Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th: Under the firm protest of the American Communist Party and the pressure of American public and trade union organizations, the American authorities were forced on April 3 to agree to return the headquarters of the American Communist Party and the "Daily Worker" building in New York, which were sealed up on March 27. Currently, the staff of the American Communist Party headquarters and the "Daily Worker" have returned to their offices and resumed work.

Since the aforementioned institutions of the American Communist Party were sealed up, the American Communist Party and the "Daily Worker" have continuously published statements and editorials protesting the atrocities of the American government and exposing the fascist nature of the American government's action of sealing up the American Communist Party institutions under the pretext of "tax arrears." The lawyers of the American Communist Party have been negotiating with tax officials for days, demanding the return of the sealed property of the American Communist Party. These protests and demands of the American Communist Party have gained widespread sympathy from the American public. Even some bourgeois newspapers and social groups, such as the "New York Post" and the "American Civil Liberties Union," have expressed dissatisfaction with the American government's crude actions, criticizing such actions as an infringement on democratic freedom.

Apparently under pressure from public opinion, the American court announced on April 3 that it agreed to the American Communist Party's request: before making a final ruling on the case, the American Communist Party would provide a deposit, and then the American Communist Party's property in New York would be returned. Subsequently, according to the court's decision, officials of the US Internal Revenue Service returned the headquarters of the American Communist Party and the "Daily Worker" building in New York, as well as the archives, books, and letters taken from these two places during the seizure.

    美政府被迫交还美共总部和“工人日报”的财产
    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：在美国共产党的坚决抗议以及美国公众和工会组织的压力下，美国当局在四月三日被迫同意交还在三月二十七日查封的在纽约的美国共产党总部和“工人日报”馆。目前美国共产党总部和“工人日报”的工作人员已经回到了他们的办公室，恢复了工作。
    自从美国共产党上述机构被查封以来，美国共产党和“工人日报”不断发表声明和社论，抗议美国政府的暴行和揭露美国政府以“欠税”为借口而查封美国共产党机构的行动的法西斯性质。美国共产党的律师连日同税务局官员交涉，要求发还被查封的美国共产党的财产。美国共产党的这些抗议和要求获得了美国公众的广泛同情。甚至一些资产阶级报纸和社会团体，例如“纽约邮报”和“美国民权保障联盟”也对美国政府的粗暴行动表示不满，抨击这种行动是对民主自由的侵犯。
    显然是迫于舆论的压力，美国法院在四月三日宣布，它同意美国共产党的要求：在对这个案件作出最后裁决以前，由美国共产党提出一笔保证金，然后发还美国共产党在纽约的财产。随后，美国税务局官员根据法院的决定交还了美国共产党在纽约的总部和“工人日报”馆以及在查封时拿走的这两个地方的档案、书籍和信件。
