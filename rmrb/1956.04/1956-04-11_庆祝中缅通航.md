    Editorial
    The inauguration of the civil aviation route between Burma and China by the Union of Burma Airways and the Civil Aviation Administration of China, according to the Sino-Burmese Air Transport Agreement, officially begins today. This is a major event in the relations between China and Burma, marking a new development in the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. The establishment of regular civil aviation routes between China and Burma will not only shorten the transportation distance between our two countries and enhance mutual understanding and friendly exchanges between the two peoples, but also have significant implications for developing mutually beneficial trade and promoting national economic prosperity for both countries.
    The Sino-Burmese Air Transport Agreement and the Protocol on Handling Air Services between the two countries were signed in November last year. According to the agreement and the protocol, the Civil Aviation Administration of China will operate the round-trip route between Kunming-Mandalay-Rangoon; the Union of Burma Airways will operate the round-trip route between Rangoon-Mandalay-Kunming-Guangzhou. For more than four months, the governments and peoples of China and Burma have been actively preparing for the opening of this air route with the greatest enthusiasm, and the trial flights have been carried out smoothly.
    Developing the aviation industry between China and Burma is a matter that the Prime Ministers of China and Burma decided long ago in order to strengthen the friendly cooperation between our two countries. The joint communiqué issued by the two Prime Ministers in December 1954 stipulated: "In order to promote economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, the two Prime Ministers believe that it is necessary to prepare for the opening of air routes between China and Burma, restore highway traffic between China and Burma, and conclude postal and telecommunications agreements between the two countries." The signing of the Sino-Burmese Air Transport Agreement and the inauguration of the civil aviation routes between the two countries are a concrete implementation of many items in the joint communiqué of the two Prime Ministers to strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries.
    Since the publication of the joint communiqué of the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Burma have become closer, and the friendly exchanges between the peoples of our two countries have become more frequent. Our two countries have not only signed an air transport agreement and started air service, but also conducted negotiations on postal and telecommunications links. The economic and trade relations between the two countries based on equality and mutual benefit are developing rapidly. In 1955 alone, the trade volume between our two countries increased sharply. The new 1955-1956 barter trade agreement has been signed, and the economic trade between the two countries will be further consolidated and developed. During this period, Burma sent cultural, military, and Buddhist delegations to visit China, and China also sent cultural, agricultural, and Buddhist delegations to visit Burma. At the invitation of the Government of the Union of Burma, Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, paid a friendly visit to Burma not long ago and received an extremely warm welcome from the Burmese government and people. All these facts show that the various principles in the joint communiqué of the Prime Ministers of China and Burma are being concretely realized, and the friendly cooperation between our two countries based on the Five Principles is constantly developing.
    The establishment of regular air routes between China and Burma not only plays an important role in strengthening friendly cooperation between China and Burma, but will also contribute to the friendly exchanges between other countries in Asia. In particular, the friendly exchanges between the peoples of Southeast Asia and the Near and Middle East and the Chinese people will be greatly facilitated, and the Burmese people can also establish close ties with the people of more Asian countries through this air route.
    The establishment and inauguration of the Sino-Burmese civil aviation route is a vivid example of strengthening international cooperation between governments and peoples of all countries. This cooperation is based on complete equality and is beneficial to the governments and peoples of both countries. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the major development of aviation between China and Burma, and congratulate the rapid progress of friendship and cooperation between the two peoples!

    庆祝中缅通航
    根据中缅两国航空运输协定，缅甸联邦航空公司同我国民用航空局开辟的两国之间的民用航空线，在今天正式开始通航了。这是中缅两国关系中的一件大事，它标志着我们两国之间的友好和合作关系的新的发展。中缅两国建立定期的民用航空线，不但将缩短我们两国之间的交通里程，增进两国人民之间的了解和友好往来，并且在发展我们两国平等互利的贸易和繁荣国家经济方面，也有重大的意义。
    中缅两国航空运输协定和办理两国航空业务的议定书，是在去年十一月间订立的。根据协定和议定书的规定：中国民用航空局经营昆明—曼德勒—仰光之间的往返航线；缅甸联邦航空公司经营仰光—曼德勒—昆明—广州之间的往返航线。四个多月来，中缅两国政府和人民曾以最大的热情积极筹备这条航空线通航的工作，并且顺利地进行了试航。
    发展中缅两国之间的航空事业，是中缅两国总理为加强我们两国的友好合作早经决定的事项。两国总理在1954年12月间发表的会谈公报中规定：“为了根据平等互利的原则促进两国的经济和文化交流，两国总理认为有必要准备开辟中缅两国间的航空线，恢复中缅两国间的公路交通并缔结两国间的邮电协定。”中缅两国航空运输协定的签订和两国民用航空线的通航，就是贯彻两国总理会谈公报中许多为加强两国友好合作的项目的一种具体实施。
    从中缅两国总理会谈公报发表以来，中缅两国的友好合作关系更加密切，我们两国人民之间的友好来往更加频繁了。我们两国不仅签订了航空运输协定并开始通航，同时还进行了通邮通电的谈判。两国间平等互利的经济和贸易关系更在迅速地发展。在1955年一年间，我们两国间贸易额有了急剧的增长。新的1955年—1956年换货议定书已经签订，两国间的经济贸易必将获得进一步的巩固和发展。在这期间，缅甸派遣了文化、军事、佛教等代表团到我国访问，我国也派遣了文化、农业、佛教等代表团访问了缅甸。我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会宋庆龄副委员长应缅甸联邦政府的邀请，在不久以前到缅甸作了友好访问，受到了缅甸政府和人民极热烈的欢迎。这一切事实，都说明中缅两国总理会谈公报中的各项原则正在具体实现，我们两国建立在五项原则基础上的友好合作正在不断地得到发展。
    中缅两国定期航空线的建立，不只对中缅两国友好合作的加强具有重要作用，并且将对亚洲其他各国之间的友好往来作出贡献。特别是东南亚和中近东各国人民同中国人民之间的友好往来将得到极大的方便，而缅甸人民也可以经过这条航空线同更多的亚洲国家人民发生密切的联系。
    中缅民用航空线的建立和通航，是各国政府和人民间加强国际合作的生动范例。这种合作是建立在完全平等的基础上，它对两国的政府和人民都是有利的。中国人民热烈祝贺中缅两国航空事业的重大发展，祝贺两国人民间的友谊和合作突飞猛进！
