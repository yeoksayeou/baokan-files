    Distribute Silkworm Eggs
    Yu Ming
    The silkworm rearing season is approaching, but in some areas, the work of ordering silkworm eggs is progressing very slowly. Zhejiang Province plans to distribute 845,000 sheets of silkworm eggs this spring, but only 37% have been ordered so far. Jiaxing Prefecture, which has a large silkworm rearing task, has only completed about 20% of its ordering plan.
    The slow progress in ordering is mainly due to the fact that some people in charge of silkworm production believe that "mulberry trees are growing very well this year; with mulberry leaves, there is no need to worry about the masses not raising silkworms," and "now that there is cooperativization, the agricultural cooperatives will order the eggs themselves." This laissez-faire thinking is hindering the progress of the ordering work.
    To increase the production of silkworm cocoons this year, the first thing to do is to do a good job in ordering silkworm eggs. Last year, the production plan for mulberry silkworm cocoons was not fulfilled, mainly because more than 50,000 sheets of silkworm eggs were not ordered. According to surveys, this year's mulberry branches are long and have many buds, and it is estimated that mulberry leaf production will increase by more than 10% compared with last year. However, if the task of distributing silkworm eggs cannot be completed, then this year's production plan for mulberry silkworm cocoons will still fall through. Therefore, Party and government leading organs in areas where the ordering plan has not yet been completed should criticize the laissez-faire thinking of cadres regarding the ordering work, and quickly organize silkworm professional personnel and supply and marketing cooperative personnel to quickly distribute silkworm eggs to agricultural production cooperatives according to the existing ordering plan, so that the cooperatives can arrange labor for production as early as possible.

    把蚕种发下去
    愚鸣
    养蚕季节就要到来了，但是，有些地区的蚕种订种工作进展得很迟缓。浙江省今年春季计划发种八十四万五千张，目前只订出了37％。养蚕任务很大的嘉兴专区现在仅完成订种计划百分之二十几。
    订种工作进展得慢，主要的原因是有些领导蚕业生产的人员认为“今年桑树生长发育很好；有了桑叶，不怕群众不养蚕”，“合作化了，农业合作社自己会来订种”。这种放任自流的思想阻碍了订种工作的进行。
    今年要增产蚕茧，首先就要做好订种工作。去年桑蚕茧没有完成生产计划，主要就是因为有五万多张蚕种没有订出去。根据调查，今年桑树条长芽多，估计可比去年增产桑叶一成以上。但是，如果不能完成发种任务，那么，今年桑蚕茧的生产计划就仍会落空。因此，目前还没有完成订种计划的地区的党政领导机关，应该批判干部中间对订种工作的放任自流思想，迅速地组织蚕桑专业人员和供销合作社人员按照已经有的订种计划，迅速把蚕种发到农业生产合作社去，使合作社能及早安排劳力进行生产。
