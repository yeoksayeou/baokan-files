Allow me, on behalf of the Prague Regional Center Organization affiliated with the World Federation of Scientific Workers and the Czechoslovak scientists who have participated in the association's activities since its establishment, to congratulate this significant gathering. We are very pleased to be able to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the association together with representatives of the association's affiliated institutions. The broad representation shows the growing strength and importance of the association. At the same time, we are also very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this celebration in such a friendly atmosphere created by our Chinese colleagues.

In this era when science has more control over the future of mankind than ever before, allow me, in addition to discussing the main tasks of scientists, to talk about the responsibilities of our organization—the World Federation of Scientific Workers. The achievements science has made in the past, and continues to achieve, will mean that the majority of mankind will live a happy life if these scientific achievements are used for the welfare of mankind. However, if scientific achievements are misused, it will cause unimaginable suffering and even bring mankind to the brink of destruction.

In this situation, the work of the World Federation of Scientific Workers has entered a new period. It will work under new conditions and will therefore gain new possibilities for development.

First of all, the World Federation of Scientific Workers has strengthened its strength, and the number of member organizations has been increasing. It is a true international organization of scientists with various specialties. It unites scientists from countries with different political systems, where the status of science and the possibilities for development are different. The World Federation of Scientific Workers is carrying out activities in countries with ancient scientific traditions and rich experience, and in countries that are currently building the necessary scientific foundations for their own development. In the ranks of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, some scientists come from countries where science is fully supported by the people and the government, and some scientists come from countries where science can only fulfill its mission after struggling to overcome numerous difficulties and obstacles. Therefore, this organization has unusual opportunities to exchange experiences, discuss various scientific issues, and thereby promote its advancement. At the same time, it can also make unprecedented contributions to the development of science and the improvement of the status of science in society. This also makes it responsible for asking how science should benefit mankind.

While the World Federation of Scientific Workers is developing, the current national situation is particularly favorable to the association's work.

The desire for mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence between countries is constantly growing. This desire is particularly strong in science. Therefore, for science, international cooperation is a natural need and is necessary for the development of science. Science grows and develops on this basis, and it would be unnatural and bad without this foundation.

At the same time, the atmosphere of mutual trust and mutual respect in the scientific community is becoming increasingly clear. This is an important factor in promoting international cooperation.

In many places, the desire of scientists and scientific institutions in many countries to get closer to each other has been expressed in genuine cooperation.

In this case, the association has entered a new stage of work, with various possible new prospects, new tasks, and, most importantly, new responsibilities ahead of it.

Let me give you a simple example. If our association's activities so far are like a young sapling, in its early stages of growth, we must protect it carefully to prevent the harsh world from destroying it before it grows up; then our current task is to continue to cultivate it, provide it with everything it needs, so that it can grow up and bear abundant fruits. We have an excellent climate for it to grow, but the success of the harvest depends on our efforts and abilities. The association is well suited to shoulder this task in the work of developing world science and mutual cooperation, and the situation requires it to do so. Whether it can shoulder this task depends on us.

In my opinion, the association can only complete this task if it guides its work according to the following points:

(1) All honest scientists in the world who are dedicated to science, regardless of their nationality and political system, should have a common starting point in their work, that is: to discover true scientific truth.

(2) All honest scientists in the world should engage in scientific research with the aim of strengthening human power and increasing human welfare.

(3) All honest scientists should be responsible for how the results of their scientific work are applied—whether it harms mankind or benefits mankind.

(4) Although all honest scientists are pursuing the same goal, their strength is dispersed because they do not do enough to exchange knowledge with each other, and also because those who do not like to see mankind progress in peace attempt to conceal the truth from them, thus hindering their mutual understanding.

It is in this regard that the association faces huge tasks and possibilities: its purpose and tasks are in line with the purpose and tasks of honest scientists. The composition of the association and the tasks it has set for itself enable it to promote international cooperation and mutual understanding.

If our association can consistently and fully engage in its activities in this direction, and approach scientific workers on the basis of the charter and constitution of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, then it will gradually become a forum for all honest scientists in the world.

We scientific workers who are able to work in countries building socialism are very fortunate. The political systems of these countries, by their very nature, not only fully support science and its development, but also directly use science to improve the welfare of citizens. Therefore, we are particularly interested in the international cooperation organized by the World Federation of Scientific Workers.

In order for scientists to bear and fulfill their responsibilities, our countries are fulfilling the above points, which enables scientists to understand the truth without restriction and to use the results of their work as soon as possible to improve the welfare of their own people and all mankind.

This status of science is a very new status, and in order to enable it to enjoy this status, it is necessary to concentrate all the excellent and progressive scientific traditions and experiences in the world.

We believe that our efforts can and will receive the concern and support of scientists in some countries where science has not yet enjoyed this status.

In seeking these new methods to apply science, we are not only for our country, but also for the benefit of mankind and progress.

In some countries, this status of science has not yet been formed, but there is a wealth of experience and tradition. We firmly believe that the interests and experiences of scientists in these countries can make a valuable contribution to this common scientific endeavor.

I firmly believe that as long as the members of our association work for mutual understanding and respect among all honest scientists in the world, the number of member organizations in our association will not only increase, but it will also penetrate into the daily lives of all honest scientists in the world, and make it a necessary organization and forum for them.

This lofty task and purpose is in line with the current responsibilities of our association, and we should use them to measure the results of our work in the future.

Allow me to wish our association, our member organizations and their members and staff, and all honest scientists in the world, greater strength, greater ability and greater success in peaceful activities in this significant stage and in the work of benefiting all mankind.

    捷克斯洛伐克依万·马列克院士的发言
    请允许我代表世界科学工作者协会所属的布拉格区域中心组织和自该会成立以来就参加协会活动的捷克斯洛伐克科学家们，祝贺这一意义重大的集会。我们非常高兴能够同协会的附属机构的代表们一道纪念协会的十周年，代表们具有如此广泛的代表性，这说明了协会的力量在日益增长，它的意义也越来越大；同时我们也很高兴能够有机会在我们的中国同事所创造的这样友好的气氛中参加这个庆祝会。
    在这科学比过去更加掌握了人类未来的时代，请允许我除了谈到科学家的主要任务以外，再谈一谈我们的组织——世界科协的责任。科学过去取得了成就，现在仍在获得新的成就，如果把这些科学成就用来为人类的福利服务，那将意味着人类的大多数都将过着美满生活。但是，如果科学成果遭到滥用，那就会造成不可想像的苦难，甚至把人类带到毁灭的边缘。
    在这种形势下，世界科协的工作进入了一个新的时期，它将在新的条件下工作，因而也将获得新的发展的可能性。
    首先，世界科协加强了自己的力量，会员组织的数目一直在增加。它是具有各种专长的科学家的真正的国际组织。它团结了政治制度不同的国家的科学家，在这些国家里，科学所处的地位和发展的可能性都各不相同。在那些具有古老的科学传统和经验丰富的国家，和那些目前正在为了自己的发展建立着必要的科学基础的国家，世界科协都在进行着活动。在世界科协的队伍中，有的科学家来自科学受到人民和政府完全支持的国家，有的科学家来自只有经过斗争克服重重困难和障碍科学才能完成自己的使命的国家。因此，这个组织有着不平常的机会，来交流经验，讨论各种科学问题，从而促进它向前发展。同时，对于科学的发展和提高科学在社会上的地位方面，它也可以作出前所未有的贡献。这也就使它有责任过问科学应该怎样为人类谋福利。
    在世界科协发展的同时，目前的国家形势对协会工作是格外有利的。
    要求国与国之间相互了解和和平共处的愿望正不断地增长。这种愿望在科学方面显得特别强烈。所以，对科学来说，国际合作是一个自然而然的需要，是科学的发展所必需的。科学就是在这个基础上成长和发展起来的，没有这个基础那就不自然和不好了。
    同时，科学界的互相信任，和互相尊重的气氛日益变得明朗了。这是促进国际合作的重要因素。
    在许多地方，很多国家的科学工作者和科学机构要求相互接近的愿望已经表现在真正的合作上面了。
    在这种情况下，协会进入了一个新的工作阶段，在它前面有各种可能的新的前景、新的任务，而尤其重要的是新的责任。
    让我给大家举一个简单的例子。如果说到现在为止我们协会的活动好比是一棵幼小的树苗，在它成长的初期，我们必须妥加保护，以免严峻的世界在它还没有成长的时候摧残它；那么我们现在的任务就是继续培育它，为它提供它所需要的一切，使它能成长起来并结出丰硕的果实。我们有着使它成长的优良气候，但是收成的好坏就要看我们的努力和能力了。协会在发展世界科学和相互合作的工作里很适于担负这个任务，而且形势也要求它这样做。至于它是否能担负这个任务就取决于我们了。
    在我看来，协会只有依据下列各点来指导它的工作，才能够完成这个任务：
    （1）世界上一切献身于科学的正直的科学家，不论他们的国籍和政治制度如何，在他们的工作中都应当有一个共同的出发点，那就是：发现真正的科学真理。
    （2）世界上一切正直的科学家应当本着加强人类的力量和增进人类的福利的目的来从事科学研究。
    （3）一切正直的科学家对于他们科学工作的成果如何应用——是危害人类或是为人类谋福利——应负责任。
    （4）尽管所有正直的科学家所追求的目标是一致的，但他们的力量却是分散的，这是因为他们在彼此间交换知识方面做得不够，同时也因为那些不喜欢看到人类在和平中进步的人们企图对他们隐瞒真实情况，因而阻挠他们相互了解。
    就是在这方面，协会面临着巨大的任务和可能性：它的目的和任务与正直科学家的目的和任务是相符的。协会的组成和它自己确定的任务使它能够促进国际合作和相互了解。
    如果我们的协会能够一贯地和全力地朝着这个方向从事它的活动，并且在世界科学工作者协会的会章和宪章的基础上接近科学工作者的话，那么它一定会逐渐地成为世界上一切正直科学家的讲坛。
    我们这些能够在建设社会主义的国家里工作的科学工作者是很幸运的。这些国家的政治制度就其性质而言不仅充分支持科学及其发展，而且把科学直接用于增进公民的福利，因此，我们对于世界科学工作者协会所组织的这种国际合作就特别感到兴趣。
    为了使科学家能负担起并完成自己的责任，我们这些国家正在履行上述各点，这就使得科学家能够毫无限制地了解真实情况，并能把他们工作的成果尽快地用来增进本国人民和全人类的福利。
    科学的这种地位是种很新的地位，要想使它享有这种地位，就必需要集中全世界的一切优良和进步的科学传统和经验。
    我们相信我们的这种努力能够而且一定会得到某些国家的科学家的关心和支持，在这些国家里，科学还没有享有这种地位。
    在寻求这些新方法来应用科学时，我们不仅是为了我们的国家，而且也是为了人类和进步的利益。
    在有些国家里，科学的这种地位尚未形成，但已存在着丰富的经验和传统，我们深信这些国家的科学家们的兴趣和经验能够对这一共同的科学事业作出一种极有价值的贡献。
    我深信，只要我们科协的成员能为全世界一切诚实的科学家之间的相互了解和尊重而工作，我们的协会不但会员组织的数目会有所增加，它还会深入到全世界一切诚实的科学家的日常生活中去，并使它成为他们所需要的组织和讲坛。
    这个崇高的任务和宗旨是与我们协会目前的责任相符合的，而且将来我们应该用它们来衡量我们工作的结果。
    请允许我祝我们的协会，我们的会员组织及其成员和工作人员，以及全世界所有正直的科学家们，在这个意义重大的阶段里的和平活动中和在为全人类谋福利的工作中得到更大的力量，更大的能力和更大的成功。
