According to the regulations of the Ministry of Coal Industry and the past habits of drilling workers, in coalfield geological drilling, if iron sand is used when drilling through hard rock layers, then when encountering shale and other soft rock layers, water needs to be added to retrieve all the iron sand before changing to diamond drill bits. This avoids the iron sand from dropping between the drill bit and the well wall and causing accidents. Under normal geological conditions, drilling a deep hole (300 to 500 meters) involves encountering soft rock layers at least five times, requiring five sand retrieval operations. Each sand retrieval takes anywhere from eight hours to twenty-four hours or even several days. Averaging twelve hours per retrieval, if each drilling rig drills one deep hole per month, it would spend sixty hours retrieving sand. During sand retrieval, the workers have to work much harder than during normal drilling. Therefore, using other methods to reduce or eliminate sand retrieval is very important for improving drilling efficiency.

The workers of drill rig No. 506 of the 132nd team of the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau created a method of not retrieving sand when encountering soft rock layers in June 1954. According to their experience, whether an accident of sand jamming the drilling tools occurs does not depend on whether or not sand is retrieved, but mainly depends on the work attitude of the person operating the drilling rig. Some drillers see that the outer edge of the drill bit is almost worn out but don't replace it. Because the outer edge is too small, the diameter of the well wall is almost the same as the diameter of the drilling tool, with only a very small gap in between. At this time, even a very small grain of sand falling in can easily jam the drilling tool. If the drill bit's outer edge is checked frequently and replaced when it is about to wear out, no accidents will occur even without retrieving sand.

The no-sand-retrieval method has been used on drill rig No. 506 for more than a year, but except for the drill rig led by Sun Jingyang, which used this method in 1955, most of the drilling rigs in the 132nd team have not used it. Why is this the case? The main reason is that the leaders have conservative ideas.

In 1954, drill rig No. 506 became a drilling rig with relatively good task completion in the Tongchuan area because the workers created this experience. The leaders of the 132nd team had planned to summarize the experience of drill rig No. 506 and sent the rig captain Sun Jingmin to participate in the 1955 national coalfield geological drilling system's advanced experience exchange meeting. The workers of drill rig No. 506 were very happy and wrote down their experience. However, when the leaders of the team's Party organization, administrative department, trade union, Youth League, and technical department held a meeting to discuss this summary, they all said that this experience violated operating procedures and could not be agreed to at all. Therefore, this advanced experience was not shared at the national coalfield geological exploration system's experience exchange meeting. Since then, the leaders of the 132nd team have adopted this attitude towards drill rig No. 506: they neither summarize and promote their experience nor openly prohibit its use (because drill rig No. 506 has not had an accident for a long time, and the task is completed very well), but simply say "the workers are responsible for any accidents." Although the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau often sends people to Tongchuan to inspect the work and knows that drill rig No. 506 has a no-sand-retrieval experience, these people also believe that the workers are violating operating procedures, so they adopt the same attitude as the leaders of the drilling team. This is why this advanced experience has not been promoted until now.

In order to accelerate the efficiency of coalfield drilling in our country, we believe that now is the time for the leaders of the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau and the 132nd team to earnestly overcome conservative ideas and summarize and promote the experience of drill rig No. 506.

    不捞砂的先进经验为什么没有推广
    李茜
    根据煤炭工业部的规定和钻探工人们过去的习惯，在煤田地质钻探工作中，如果在钻进硬岩层的时候使用铁砂，则在遇到页岩等软岩层的时候就需要加水把铁砂子都捞上来，然后才能换金钢钻头钻进，这样可以避免铁砂子掉在钻头和井壁之间，避免发生事故。在一般的地质情况下，打一个深钻孔（三百公尺到五百公尺）至少遇到五次软岩层，捞五次铁砂。每捞一次铁砂，有要八小时的，有要二十四小时甚至几天的。平均每次以十二小时计算，如果每台钻机每月打一个深孔，就要用六十小时捞砂。在捞砂的时候，工人们要比正常钻进辛苦得多。所以，用别的方法来减少或取消捞砂，对提高钻进效率非常重要。
    西北煤田地质勘探局132队506号钻机的工人们，在1954年6月，创造了遇到软岩层不捞砂的方法。根据他们的经验，是否发生砂子卡钻具的事故，关键不在于捞不捞砂子，而主要决定于掌握钻机的人的劳动态度。有的钻工看见钻机的外口快磨完了还不换，因为外口太小了，井壁的直径就和钻具的直径相差不多，中间只有很小的空隙，这时候即使有很小一粒砂子掉进去，也容易把钻具卡住，如果经常检查钻机外口，发现它快磨完了就换，不捞砂也不会发生事故。
    不捞砂法在506号钻机上使用了一年多，但是132队除了孙景阳领导的钻机在1955年使用了这种方法以外，绝大部分钻机都没使用。为什么会这样呢？主要是领导人员有保守思想。
    1954年，506号钻机因为工人们创造了这个经验，就成为铜川地区完成任务比较好的钻机。132队的领导人曾打算总结506号钻机的经验，并且派机长孙景民参加1955年全国煤田地质钻探系统的先进经验交流会。506号钻机的工人们很高兴，就把自己的经验写出来。但是，队里的党组织、行政部门、工会、青年团和技术部门的领导人员开会讨论这份总结的时候，都说这个经验是违反操作规程的，根本不能同意。所以，在全国煤田地质勘探系统的经验交流会上，就没有交流这个先进经验。从此以后，132队的领导人员对506号钻机就采取这样的态度：既不总结推广他们的经验，也不公开禁止使用（因为506号钻机已经很长时间没出事故，而且任务又完成得很好），只是说“出了事故要工人们负责”。西北煤田地质勘探局虽然经常派人到铜川去检查工作，也知道506号钻机有一个不捞砂的经验，但是，这些人也认为工人们违反操作规程，所以也采取和钻探队领导人员一样的态度。这就是直到现在这个先进经验还没得到推广的原因。
    为了加速我国煤田钻探效率，我们认为现在应该是西北煤田地质勘探局和132队的领导人员切实克服保守思想，总结和推广506号钻机经验的时候了。
