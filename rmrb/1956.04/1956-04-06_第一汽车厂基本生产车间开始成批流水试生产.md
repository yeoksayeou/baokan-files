    The basic production workshops, including the chassis, metal parts, and accessories workshops, of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant began batch pilot production on assembly lines on the morning of the 2nd. This pilot production on assembly lines will further test whether the equipment, materials, tools, and workers' technical skills of these workshops can meet the requirements of large-scale, rhythmic, and standardized production on assembly lines. This pilot production on assembly lines will also accelerate the establishment of production management order in the workshops and complete the final preparations for the formal production of automobiles.
    Currently, the first pilot production on assembly lines, mainly in the chassis workshop, is being carried out on dozens of production lines. Each department and machine tool in the workshop is connected by transportation equipment such as rollers and electric trolleys to form a complex and well-ordered production whole. The blanks of various parts pass through various machine tools arranged on the processing line in order, according to their own routes, and finally become batches of qualified automobile parts through cleaning and inspection.
    In the chassis and metal parts workshops, on rows of automated and semi-automated machine tools, workers only need to carefully load and clamp the parts, and the rest of the actions are automatically executed by the machine tools.

    第一汽车厂基本生产车间开始成批流水试生产
    第一汽车制造厂底盘、金属品、附件等基本生产车间，已经在二日上午开始成批的流水试生产。这次流水试生产，将进一步考验这些车间的设备、材料、工卡具，以及工人的技术水平，能否适应大批流水的有节奏的正规化生产的要求。这次流水试生产，还将加速车间的各种组织建立起生产管理秩序，完成正式生产汽车的最后的准备工作。
    目前以底盘车间为主的第一次流水试生产，是在几十条生产线上进行的。车间各工部和各个机床，都被滚筒、电滑车等运输设备联结起来成为一个复杂而很有秩序的生产整体。各种零件的毛坯，分别按照自己的路线，挨次地从排列在加工线上的各种机床上通过，最后通过清洗和检验，便成为一批批合格的汽车零件。
    在底盘和金属品车间中一行行自动化和半自动化的各种机床上，工人们只需要仔细地把零件装卡好，其余的动作就都由机床自动地去执行。
