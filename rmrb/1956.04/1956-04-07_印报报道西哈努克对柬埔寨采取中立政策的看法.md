Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 4th: According to a report in the "Indian Express" on April 3rd, Sihanouk, who recently resigned as Prime Minister of Cambodia, spoke in Phnom Penh about his views on the Cambodian government's adoption of a neutral policy. The report said that at a press conference on April 1st, Sihanouk was asked whether Cambodia's neutral policy would be exploited by the People's Republic of China. He replied: "The current situation is just the opposite. China does not want Cambodia to join the Communist bloc, and China is pleased that we are maintaining neutrality. However, if Beijing at any time engages in subversive activities or launches an act of aggression in Cambodia, Cambodia will immediately embrace the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, but I have no such concerns. Communist countries have a certain degree of respect for neutral countries."

Sihanouk also denied the claim that he was taking orders from Prime Minister Nehru in formulating Cambodia's foreign policy. He said: "Of course, I am encouraged by his policies, but he has never given me orders. Because he has clarified some principles of international relations, and these principles are having an effect in easing international tensions, I have always followed these principles."

Explaining the reasons for his resignation, he said: "I resigned because Western countries thought I was too bad. My face does not please them." When asked if Cambodia had been under direct pressure to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Sihanouk said: "I have not received an invitation to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, but Western countries hope that I will not declare that I am outside the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Sihanouk also believes that future Cambodian governments will basically continue to follow a neutral policy, although there may be some differences in approach.

The newspaper also quoted news from Phnom Penh, pointing out that South Vietnam had in effect imposed a blockade on Cambodia in the past few weeks. South Vietnam imposed the blockade without any warning, and Cambodia was not even aware of it beforehand. Sihanouk said that according to the South Vietnamese government, which told the unofficial Cambodian expert delegation that went to Saigon, it was willing to reopen the border and conclude new agreements with Cambodia, on the condition that political relations between Phnom Penh and Saigon be restored. Sihanouk believes that Cambodia, because of its neutral stance, cannot agree to this request. He said that it is for this reason that Cambodia has not recognized East Germany or West Germany, North Korea or South Korea, the People's Republic of China or the Kuomintang. Sihanouk said that Cambodia hopes to make some adjustments to its border with South Vietnam, and that the Khmer minority in Cochinchina should enjoy the same treatment as Vietnamese people enjoy in Cambodia.

Sihanouk also pointed out that the regular army, air force, and navy of South Vietnam have participated in actions that violated the Cambodian border. The South Vietnamese government not only does not respond to Cambodia's protests but also demands the return of South Vietnamese soldiers captured on Cambodian territory. The terrorist activities of South Vietnam on the border are worsening the relations between Cambodia and South Vietnam. Many people, such as Khmer minorities and Buddhist monks, have complained of being abused and discriminated against, and therefore hope to take refuge in Cambodia to live a peaceful life.

    印报报道西哈努克对柬埔寨采取中立政策的看法
    新华社新德里4日电　据四月三日的
  “印度快报”报道，最近辞去柬埔寨首相职务的西哈努克曾经在金边谈到他对柬埔寨政府采取中立政策的看法。消息说，在四月一日的记者招待会上，有人问西哈努克，柬埔寨的中立政策会不会被中华人民共和国利用。他回答说：“目前的情况恰恰相反。中国并不希望柬埔寨参加共产党集团，中国对我们保守中立感到高兴。但是，如果北京在任何时候在柬埔寨采取颠复活动，或者是发动侵略行动，柬埔寨将立即投入东南亚条约组织的怀抱，但是我没有这样的忧虑。共产党国家对中立国家都有某种程度的尊重。”
    西哈努克也否认在制定柬埔寨的外交政策上听命于尼赫鲁总理的这种说法。他说：“我当然从他的政策中得到鼓舞，但是他从来没有对我发号施令。因为他阐明了国际关系的一些原则，而这些原则在缓和国际紧张局势中正产生效果，因此我一直遵循这些原则。”
    他在说明他辞职的原因时说：“我所以辞职是因为西方国家认为我太坏了。我的脸不能使他们高兴。”在被问及柬埔寨有没有受到要它参加东南亚条约组织的直接的压力的时候，西哈努克说：“我并没有接到过参加东南亚条约组织的邀请，但是西方国家希望我不要宣布我是置身于东南亚条约组织以外的。”
    西哈努克还认为今后的柬埔寨政府基本上仍旧将遵循中立政策，虽然在做法上可能有一些不同。
    这家报纸还引用了来自金边的消息，指出南越在过去几星期以来实际上对柬埔寨实行了封锁。南越没有提出任何警告就实行了封锁，柬埔寨在事先甚至不知道。西哈努克说，据南越政府告诉到西贡去的非官方的柬埔寨专家代表团说，它愿意重新开放边境以及同柬埔寨订立新的协定，条件是恢复金边和西贡之间的政治关系。西哈努克认为，柬埔寨由于它的中立立场，不能同意这个要求。他说，就由于这个原因，柬埔寨没有承认东德或西德、北朝鲜或南朝鲜、中华人民共和国或国民党。西哈努克说，柬埔寨希望对它同南越之间的边界进行某些调整，并且，在交趾支那的高棉少数民族应该享有同越南人在柬埔寨所享受的同样的待遇。
    西哈努克还指出，参与侵犯柬埔寨边境行动的有南越的正规的陆、空、海军。南越政府不但不答复柬埔寨的抗议，反而要求交还在柬埔寨领土上被俘的南越士兵。南越在边境上的恐怖行动正在使柬埔寨和南越之间的关系趋于恶化。有许多人像高棉少数民族和佛教和尚，都申诉遭到虐待和歧视，因此希望避难到柬埔寨来过和平生活。
