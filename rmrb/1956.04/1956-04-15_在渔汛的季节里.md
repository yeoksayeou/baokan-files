    In the Fishing Season
    Encirclement and Capture of Migratory Yellow Croaker Shoals
    Fujian Province's spring fishing season production has fully begun. In recent days, thousands of fishing boats from fisheries production cooperatives in coastal areas have successively set out to sea to encircle and capture schools of yellow croaker migrating from north to south. The *qiao zheng* fishing fleet in Wojiao Village, Dongshan Island, caught more than 1,700 *dan* of yellow croaker in the first tide of the spring fishing season.

    Jilin Extensively Builds Artificial Fish Farms
    Jilin Province now has about 700 artificial fish farms. Farmers in the eastern semi-mountainous areas are using low-lying areas in valleys and hills to build reservoirs for fish farming. Farmers in the plains on both sides of the Songhua River are converting natural ponds and swamps into fish ponds. Farmers in many remote areas who could not eat fish in the past will be able to eat fresh fish they raise themselves within three years.

    Fisheries Cooperatives Generally Increase Production
    Hubei Province, which is rich in freshwater fish production, has basically realized the cooperative transformation of fisheries. To date, a total of 414 fisheries production cooperatives have been established in the province. These fisheries production cooperatives have generally achieved great results in their production this past winter and spring. According to statistics from 264 cooperatives, the vast majority have expanded and increased production, with more than half increasing production by 20% to 100% compared to the original primary cooperatives and individual farming.

    A Large Sand Shark Weighing More Than 10,000 Jin
    Schools of large sand sharks have begun to appear in the waters around Dachen Island and Beijishan Island. Fishermen in the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang Province have long prepared thousands of sets of large sand shark hooks, waiting to catch sharks. Fishermen in Dongtou and Yuhuan counties have already caught twenty-four large sand sharks, each generally weighing 7,000 *jin*, and the largest weighing more than 10,000 *jin*.

    Ten Thousand Fishing Boats Set Out to Sea Half a Month Early
    Nearly 10,000 fishing boats in Liaoning Province have set out to sea for fishing about half a month earlier than in previous years. More than 260 fishing boats from Yingkou, Zhuanghe, Gaiping, Jin County, Panshan and other cities and counties have recently gone to Yantai, Lijin Longkou and other places in Shandong for deep-sea fishing. The Yingjian Fisheries Production Cooperative in Yingkou City has fishing boats engaged in deep-sea fishing, with each boat catching more than 10,000 *jin* of fish and shrimp per day.

    Three-Boat Double-Net Fishing Operation Method
    Employees of the Guangdong Provincial State-owned South China Aquatic Products Company have recently created the "three-boat double-net operation method," which enables each boat to catch an average of more than 900 boxes of fish per voyage, an increase of more than 200 boxes compared to the current two-boat single-net operation method.

    在渔汛的季节里
    围捕洄游的黄花鱼群
    福建省春季渔汛生产全面开始。连日来沿海各地渔业生产合作社的几千条渔船陆续出海，围捕从北向南成群洄游的黄花鱼。东山岛沃角村的敲?船队在春汛第一潮，就捕到一千七百多担黄花鱼。
    吉林广泛修建人工养鱼场
    吉林省的人工养鱼场所现在已经有七百处左右。东部半山区的农民利用山谷和丘陵地带的低洼地，修成水库养鱼。松花江两岸平原地带的农民，就把天然池沼改修成为养鱼池。许多过去吃不到鱼的偏僻地区的农民，在三年内将可以吃到自己饲养的鲜鱼。
    渔业合作社普遍增产
    淡水鱼产富饶的湖北省，基本上实现了渔业合作化。到目前止，全省共建立渔业生产合作社414个。这些渔业生产合作社在去冬今春的生产中，普遍获得很大成绩。据264个社统计，绝大部分扩大和增加了生产，一半以上的社比原来初级社和单干的时候增产两成到一倍。
    一万多斤重的大沙鱼
    大沙鱼群开始在大陈岛和北麂山岛周围的海面上出现。浙江省温州地区的渔民，早就准备好几千副大沙鱼钩，等待着捕捉沙鱼。洞头和玉环两县的渔民已经捕到大沙鱼二十四条，每条一般有七千斤重，最大的重一万多斤。
    万只渔船提早半月出海
    辽宁省近万只渔船，比往年提早半月左右出海捕鱼。营口、庄河、盖平、锦县、盘山等市、县有二百六十多只渔船最近已到山东烟台、利津龙口等地进行远洋捕鱼。营口市迎建渔业生产合作社在远洋捕鱼的渔船，每天每只船可捕鱼、虾一万多斤。
    三船拖两网的捕鱼作业法
    广东省国营南海水产公司的职工最近创造了“三船拖两网作业法”，使每一航次每条船的平均捕鱼量达到九百多箱，比现行的两船拖一网作业法的产量增加了二百多箱。　　　（据新华社讯）
