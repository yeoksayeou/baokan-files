Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 3rd: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said that India should consider and emulate China's example of agricultural cooperativization, but with necessary modifications to suit India's conditions.

Nehru said that China's agricultural cooperativization movement had achieved unexpected results. Chinese farmers have increased their income through agricultural cooperatives.

He made these remarks on April 3rd while presiding over the opening ceremony of the All-India Farmers Council meeting in New Delhi.

In his speech, Nehru opposed a few people owning large amounts of land. He also said that a large number of people owning small plots of land would not increase the prosperity of Indian agriculture, because machines could not be used effectively on small plots of land.

Nehru then said that India's First Five-Year Plan had enabled the country to achieve some progress and had brought some improvements to agriculture.

    尼赫鲁谈中国农业合作化和印度农业问题
    新华社新德里3日电　印度总理尼赫鲁说：印度应当考虑和效法中国农业合作化的榜样，但要作必要的修改使它适合印度的情况。
    尼赫鲁说：中国的农业合作化运动获得了出人意料的结果。中国农民通过农业合作社增加了他们的收入。
    他这些话是四月三日在新德里主持全印农民理事会会议开幕式的时候说的。
    尼赫鲁在演说中反对少数人拥有大批土地。他还说，大量的人拥有小块土地是不会增加印度农业的繁荣的，因为在小块土地上不能有效地使用机器。
    尼赫鲁接着说，印度的第一个五年计划已经使国家获得了某些进步，使农业获得了一些改进。
