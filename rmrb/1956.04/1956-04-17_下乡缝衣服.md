    Sewing Clothes in the Countryside
    The Hongqi Sewing Production Cooperative in Chaihebao, Kaiyuan County, Liaoning Province, changed its past business method of "waiting for customers at the door" and adopted the method of "measuring on the spot and tailoring in person" to make clothes for farmers in the countryside, which was welcomed by the farmers. On February 28th, members of the Hongqi Sewing Production Cooperative went to agricultural production cooperatives and schools in eight villages, including Dapanling and Dahongshi, to solicit work. Within four days, they undertook the production of 177 sets of clothes and 397 hats. Some farmers, because they were not ready with the cloth, repeatedly asked the members of the sewing production cooperative to come back in a few days. The cooperative has also established a product quality responsibility system and a product quality inspection system to ensure product quality.
    During the busy farming season, especially after women participated in production, many farmers had no time to make clothes. The practice of the Hongqi Sewing Production Cooperative in Kaiyuan County going to the countryside to sew clothes not only facilitated the farmers but also expanded the cooperative's business. This is a good way for handicraft production to face the countryside and serve agricultural production.

    下乡缝衣服
    辽宁省开原县柴河堡红旗缝纫生产合作社，改变了过去“守门等客”的经营方法，采取了“就地量尺，当面剪裁”的方法，到农村去给农民做衣服，受到农民的欢迎。二月二十八日，红旗缝纫生产合作社的社员们分头到大盘岭、大红石等八个村的农业生产合作社和学校揽活，在四天内，承制了177套衣服，397顶帽子。有些农民因为没准备好布，就再三要求缝纫生产合作社的社员过几天再来。合作社还建立了产品质量负责制和产品质量检查等制度，以保证产品质量。
    在农忙季节，特别是妇女参加生产以后，许多农民都没时间做衣服了。开原县红旗缝纫生产合作社下乡缝衣服的作法，既便利了农民，又扩大了合作社的业务。这是手工业生产面向农村，为农业生产服务的一个好办法。
