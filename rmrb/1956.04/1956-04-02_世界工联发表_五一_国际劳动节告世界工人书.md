Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 1st: The World Federation of Trade Unions has issued its "May Day" International Labor Day message to the working men and women of the world.

The message to the working men and women of the world states that for seventy years, every time "May Day" arrives, the working people of the world have expressed their determination to unite and struggle to achieve the common goals that unite them – improving living standards, defending freedom and peace. The "May Day" of 1956 will also be celebrated under the slogan of demanding the realization of these ideals. The idea of unity has never been as urgently important to the working people and the international trade union movement as it is now.

The message to the workers of the world then points out that the working people in capitalist countries are waging a tenacious struggle against exploitation; the working people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries are jointly building and consolidating the socialist system, which has already proven its superiority over the capitalist system to the world. The working people of all countries are satisfied to hear the news that the Soviet Union is going to implement a seven-hour work system; the working people of the oppressed countries are smashing the shackles of colonialism. Their role in the national liberation movement is constantly growing. The working people of the world are uniting to ease international tensions and fight for peace, unanimously advocating disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons.

The World Federation of Trade Unions pays tribute to the millions of working people around the world who are fighting together to achieve their demands. On the eve of this year's "May Day," the World Federation of Trade Unions once again assures them of its unconditional support. The World Federation of Trade Unions reminds everyone that unity is the hallmark of all measures taken by the working people, and only unity is the road to success. The forces of peace are forcing those who advocate the Cold War to lower their voices, the colonialists have been defeated, and the measures taken by the working people to achieve their demands have often been successful.

The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the working people to strive for new and more decisive victories, which are very close as long as we strengthen the unity of national and international trade unions. Only through the efforts of all workers and all trade union organizations to achieve this task can this unity be established.

    世界工联发表“五一”国际劳动节告世界工人书
    新华社布拉格1日电　世界工会联合会发表了“五一”国际劳动节告世界男女工人书。
    告世界男女工人书说，七十年来每当“五一”节的时候，全世界劳动人民都表示决心，团结一致为争取实现使他们联合在一起的共同目标——改善生活水平、保卫自由和和平而斗争。1956年的“五一”节也将在要求实现这些理想的口号下来庆祝。团结的思想对劳动人民和国际工会运动来讲，从来没有像现在这样具有迫切的重要性。
    告世界工人书接着指出，资本主义国家劳动人民正在为反对剥削进行顽强的斗争；苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的劳动人民正在共同建立和巩固社会主义制度，这种制度已经向全世界证明它比资本主义制度优越。各国劳动人民满意地听到苏联要实行七小时工作制的消息；被压迫的国家的劳动人民正在粉碎殖民主义的枷锁。他们在民族解放运动中的作用不断增长。全世界劳动人民正在团结起来为缓和国际紧张局势，为和平而斗争，一致主张裁减军备、禁止原子武器和热核子武器。
    世界工会联合会向为达到自己的要求而共同奋斗的全世界千千万万的劳动人民致敬。在今年“五一”节前夕，世界工会联合会再次保证给他们以无条件的支持。世界工会联合会提醒大家注意，团结是劳动人民的一切措施的特征，只有团结才是成功的道路。和平的力量迫使主张冷战的人不得不放低他们的叫嚣，殖民主义者遭到了失败，劳动人民为达到自己的要求所实行的措施常常得到成功。
    世界工会联合会号召劳动人民为新的、更具有决定性意义的胜利而奋斗，只要加强全国性的和国际性的工会的团结，这种胜利是很近了。只有靠为实现这一任务而努力的全体劳动者、全体工会组织才能确立这种团结。
