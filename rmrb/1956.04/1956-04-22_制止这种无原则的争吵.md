To the Editor:

The Nanchang Power Plant needs to install a 6,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator made in China. Because the Shanghai Turbine Factory completed its production tasks ahead of schedule last year, the Shanghai Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, which is responsible for the installation work, advanced the construction plan accordingly. But unfortunately, the installation work cannot be completed ahead of schedule, and it cannot even be completed on schedule according to the original plan. The reason is that the main accessory of the turbine, the condenser, cannot be delivered on time.

On November 14th last year, at the ordering meeting for the Nanchang Power Plant project held by the Power Station Complete Equipment Supply Company of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, it was clearly stipulated that the Shanghai Turbine Factory was responsible for design and material supply, and the Shanghai Boiler Factory would manufacture a condenser in March of this year; at that time, both the Shanghai Turbine Factory and the Shanghai Boiler Factory agreed. However, when the Shanghai Turbine Factory handed over the design drawings to the Shanghai Boiler Factory and prepared to sign the contract, the Shanghai Boiler Factory proposed that a drilling machine must be allocated, otherwise it would refuse to sign the contract. The Shanghai Turbine Factory did not agree to this request, so the work of manufacturing the condenser was delayed.

In January this year, the director of the Fourth Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry went to Shanghai to inspect the work. After consultation with the directors of the two factories, it was decided that the Shanghai Turbine Factory would allocate a drilling machine to the Shanghai Boiler Factory, and then sign the contract for manufacturing the condenser. Originally, this dispute could have been ended. However, after the director of the Fourth Machine Industry Bureau left Shanghai, new disputes arose between the two factories. Because the Shanghai Turbine Factory allocated an old-fashioned drilling machine to the Shanghai Boiler Factory, the Shanghai Boiler Factory demanded a new Czech drilling machine that had just been shipped from abroad. Thus, the contract still could not be signed.

Later, the Shanghai Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry learned about this matter and negotiated with the Power Station Complete Equipment Supply Company of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry. At this time, the Shanghai Boiler Factory felt that the problem was serious, so they changed their attitude and no longer insisted on allocating a drilling machine. However, at this time, the Shanghai Turbine Factory refused to sign a contract with the Shanghai Boiler Factory.

The result of this unprincipled quarrel is that the condenser cannot be manufactured on time, the Shanghai Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry cannot construct according to plan, the installation project of the Nanchang Power Plant cannot be completed ahead of schedule, and the production of these two factories themselves has also suffered losses. The harm to the country caused by this behavior that disregards the overall interests is very great. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will correct their mistakes.

### 制止这种无原则的争吵

    制止这种无原则的争吵编辑同志：
    南昌电站需要安装一台我国自制的六千瓩汽轮发电机。因为去年上海汽轮机厂的生产任务提前完成了，所以负责安装工作的电力工业部上海基本建设局就把施工计划相应地提前了。但是很可惜，安装工作不但不能提前完成，而且还不能按原计划如期完成。原因是汽轮机的主要附件冷凝器不能如期交货。
    去年十一月十四日，在第一机械工业部电站成套设备供应公司召开的南昌电站工程订货会议上，曾经明确规定由上海汽轮机厂负责设计和供应材料，由上海锅炉厂在今年三月制造出一台冷凝器；当时上海汽轮机厂和上海锅炉厂都表示同意。但是当上海汽轮机厂把设计图纸等交给上海锅炉厂而准备签订合同的时候，上海锅炉厂却提出必须调拨一台钻床，否则就拒绝签订合同。上海汽轮机厂没有答应这个要求，因此制造冷凝器的工作就拖下来了。
    今年一月里，第一机械工业部第四机器工业管理局局长到上海检查工作，同这两个厂的厂长协商以后，决定由上海汽轮机厂调拨一台钻床给上海锅炉厂，然后签订制造冷凝器的合同。本来这场争执可以结束了。但是，当第四机器工业管理局局长离上海以后，两个工厂之间又发生了新的争执。因为上海汽轮机厂调给上海锅炉厂的是一台老式钻床，而上海锅炉厂却提出要刚从国外运到的捷克新式钻床。这样，合同仍然不能签订。
    后来，电力工业部上海基本建设局知道了这件事，就向第一机械工业部电站成套设备供应公司交涉。这时候上海锅炉厂感到问题严重了，他们就改变了态度，不再坚持非要调拨钻床不可。但是，这时候上海汽轮机厂又不肯和上海锅炉厂签订合同了。
    这种无原则争吵的结果是，冷凝器不能按时制好，电力工业部上海基本建设局不能按计划施工，南昌电站的安装工程不能提前完成，而且这两个工厂自己的生产也受到了损失。这种不顾整体利益的行为给国家带来的危害是很大的，希望有关机关纠正他们的错误。
