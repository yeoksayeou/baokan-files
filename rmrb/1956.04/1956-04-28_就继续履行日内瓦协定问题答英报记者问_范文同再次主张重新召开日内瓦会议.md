Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 27th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 26th, Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recently said in response to questions raised by Dennis Bloodworth, a reporter for the London "Observer", that it is very important for the Vietnam International Commission to continue its work in North and South Vietnam on the basis of the Geneva Accords. The International Commission, the Joint Commission, and the Liaison Delegation will continue to work in accordance with the Geneva Accords.

Pham Van Dong requested that the British government guarantee respect for the Geneva Accords and ensure their continued implementation. Pham Van Dong said that in order to ensure the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords, the French and South Vietnamese authorities should fully fulfill their obligations under the Geneva Accords; according to Article 27 of the Geneva Accords, the South Vietnamese authorities are the fully legitimate successor to France in continuing to implement the Geneva Accords.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that although French troops have withdrawn, the Government of the French Republic and the South Vietnamese authorities should still jointly be responsible for implementing the Geneva Accords signed by the French representative on behalf of France and the South Vietnamese authorities.

Pham Van Dong also reiterated the proposal to reconvene the Geneva Conference to resolve all issues related to the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords.

When talking about the disagreement between the Lao Kingdom Government and Laos, Pham Van Dong said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sincerely hopes that the dispute between the Lao Kingdom Government and Laos can be resolved in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords.

    范文同要求英国政府方面保证尊重日内瓦协定，并且使日内瓦协定继续履行。范文同说，为了使日内瓦协定继续履行，法国和南越当局应该充分履行它们根据日内瓦协定所承担的义务；根据日内瓦协定第二十七条规定，南越当局是法国继续实施日内瓦协定的完全合法的继承人。
    范文同指出，尽管法国军队撤退了，法兰西共和国政府和南越当局仍然应该共同负责实施由法国代表代表法国和南越当局所签署的日内瓦协定。
    范文同并且再次提出重新召开日内瓦会议来解决所有有关继续履行日内瓦协定的问题。
    范文同在谈到老挝王国政府和寮国之间的分歧这个问题时说，越南民主共和国政府衷心希望老挝王国政府和寮国之间的争端能够根据日内瓦协定的文字和精神得到解决。
