    Carry Forward the "Bandung Spirit"
    One year ago today, government leaders from twenty-nine countries in the Asia-Africa region gathered in Bandung and began the Asia-Africa Conference, which will forever occupy a glorious place in history. Subsequently, the imperishable "Bandung Spirit" emerged from this conference.
    One year later today, many new countries have been established in the Asia-Africa region, and many other countries are working hard to develop friendly cooperation with each other. The shackles of colonialism are breaking one after another, military blocs of imperialism that divide and control Asia-Africa countries are shaking, and peace zones are expanding. On this historic day, the Chinese people, together with the people of Asia and Africa, feel a common pride and common joy. We would like to extend our festive greetings and warm congratulations to the people of all Asia-Africa Conference participating countries and all Asia-Africa people who are struggling for independence and peace.
    Peace! Independence! Friendship! This is the overwhelming desire of the Asia-Africa people. The "Bandung Spirit" is the concentrated expression of this desire. Under the inspiration of this spirit, the struggle of the Asia-Africa people against colonialism and for national independence has achieved many significant victories. Sudan has shaken off the long-term enslavement of foreign forces and become an independent republic. Relying on their own struggles and the support of the Asia-Africa people, the national rights of Morocco and Tunisia have been recognized successively; following Sudan, they have embarked on the road of independent development. The Algerian people are carrying out persistent struggles for the right to national self-determination; their desire for national independence has been universally supported by the people of Asia and Africa. The Arab countries, led by Egypt, resolutely safeguard their national sovereignty and resist various activities of international aggressive blocs that undermine the national interests of Arab countries. In Jordan, General Glubb, a symbol of British colonial rule who held the military and political power of Jordan, was driven away. In Indonesia, the new cabinet has decided to abolish the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference agreement and announced that it will establish a province in West Irian. In India, the struggle to recover Goa has become a movement with a national scale. In Japan, the patriotic independent movement demanding to get rid of American control is developing day by day. All of this shows that the time has come to completely abolish the shameful colonial system, whether this system is supported by bloody terror rule or concealed by the form of military blocs.
    Under the promotion of the "Bandung Spirit", the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles unanimously agreed upon by the Asia-Africa Conference have received increasingly widespread support. These principles have become the foundation for friendly unity and enhanced cooperation among Asia-Africa countries. In the past year, following China, India, Burma, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Nepal, Afghanistan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, Cambodia, and other Asian countries have successively announced their acceptance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, taking them as the criteria for guiding relations between countries. Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, also announced that he would pursue the Five Principles. In fact, the practical application of the Five Principles has surpassed the scope of the Asia-Africa region and has been recognized by many peace-loving countries and a wider range of social strata in the world. Over the past year, the idea of peace, neutrality, and non-participation in military blocs has also been further developed. Here, one cannot but welcome the statement of the new Prime Minister of Ceylon, who announced that Ceylon "will adopt a neutral policy and will not form an alliance with any major power bloc." Even in Asian countries that have participated in the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Treaty, the call for peace, neutrality, and the implementation of an independent foreign policy is getting louder and louder. The United States' policy of piecing together military blocs has been met with the sharpest condemnation from Asia-Africa countries. It is becoming increasingly difficult for "Cold War" experts to continue peddling the notorious policy of "strength."
    The "Bandung Spirit" has strengthened the unity of Asia-Africa countries, thereby enabling Asia-Africa countries to play an increasingly important role in international affairs. Now, any major issue related to the Asia-Africa region cannot be resolved without the participation of Asia-Africa countries. The "Bandung Spirit" is not only the leading force in promoting the development of the Asia-Africa situation, but its influence can be felt everywhere in international affairs. For example, at the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, thanks to the efforts of Asia-Africa countries, some sharp anti-colonial proposals were included on the agenda, and clauses recognizing the right to national self-determination were included in the draft human rights convention.
    The great strength of the "Bandung Spirit" is also manifested in the important development of friendly relations between Asia-Africa countries and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries have conducted economic and cultural exchanges with many Asia-Africa countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In particular, the mutual visits of state leaders of the Soviet Union, India, Burma, and other countries, as well as the Soviet Union's practical support for the desire of Asian countries for national industrialization, have set a good example for the realization of friendly cooperation between countries with different social systems.
    China is one of the participating countries of the Asia-Africa Conference. At the Asia-Africa Conference, the Chinese delegation established friendly contacts with representatives of various Asia-Africa countries. Since the Asia-Africa Conference, China has always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Asia-Africa Conference to promote friendly unity with various Asia-Africa countries. Over the past year, China, India, and Burma have closely cooperated in the cause of safeguarding world peace, and our good relations have been further developed. China's friendship with Pakistan has also been significantly enhanced. China and the Arab countries, led by Egypt, have established more and more contacts in political, economic, and cultural aspects. China has consistently sympathized with and supported the struggle of the North African people for self-determination and independence. China and the Kingdom of Cambodia have established sincere friendship. There have been much more exchanges and mutual understanding between the Chinese people and the Japanese people than before. Our joint efforts in developing friendly cooperation with various countries in the spirit of "Bandung" are of great benefit to maintaining and consolidating peace in the Asia-Africa region. This fact has been recognized by all countries and people who are truly concerned about the cause of peace and independence.
    In commemorating the first anniversary of the Asia-Africa Conference, the Chinese people are willing to actively work to further strengthen the friendly unity and close cooperation between Asia-Africa countries. This is not only the wish of the Chinese people, but also the wish of the people of Asia and Africa. Because only by strengthening this unity and cooperation can we effectively get rid of the backwardness caused by the long-term enslavement of colonialism in the Asia-Africa region, and can we effectively safeguard world peace. The unity of Asia-Africa countries does not prevent them from establishing and developing good relations with other countries. Only those with ulterior motives are afraid of the unity of Asia-Africa countries. The enemies of peace and unity, as well as the supporters of the colonial system, have been cursing the "Bandung Spirit" for a year, trying their best to limit the development of the "Bandung Spirit" and attempting to strangle it. But history has and will continue to answer them in this way: this despicable plan will never be realized; in the struggle for national independence and in the cause of defending world peace, the people of Asia and Africa will become more and more united and forge ahead courageously.

### 发扬“万隆精神”

    发扬“万隆精神”
    一年前的今天，亚非地区二十九个国家的政府领袖聚会万隆，开始了在历史上永远占有光辉地位的亚非会议。随后，从这个会议产生了永不磨灭的“万隆精神”。
    一年后的今天，许多新的国家在亚非地区建立起来了，另外许多国家正在努力发展相互之间的友好合作。殖民主义的锁链节节断碎了，帝国主义分裂和控制亚非国家的军事集团正在发生动摇，和平地区正在扩大。在这个历史性的节日里，中国人民同亚非各国的人民一起，感到共同的自豪和共同的高兴。我们愿意向所有亚非会议参加国的人民和所有正在为争取独立和平而斗争的亚非人民致以节日的敬礼和热烈的祝贺。
    和平！独立！友好！这是亚非人民压倒一切的愿望。“万隆精神”，就是这种愿望的集中表现。在这个精神的鼓舞之下，亚非人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争取得了许多重大的胜利。苏丹已经摆脱了外来势力的长期奴役，成为一个独立的共和国。依靠自己的斗争和亚非人民的支援，摩洛哥和突尼斯的民族权利先后获得了承认；它们继苏丹之后，开始走上了独立发展的道路。阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族自决权利，正进行着坚持不懈的斗争；他们要求民族独立的愿望得到了亚非各国人民的普遍支持。以埃及为首的阿拉伯国家，坚决维护它们的国家主权，抗拒着国际侵略集团破坏阿拉伯国家民族利益的各种活动。在约旦，象征着英国殖民统治的“尊严”、掌握着约旦军政大权的格拉布将军被赶走了。在印度尼西亚，新内阁已决定废除荷兰—印度尼西亚圆桌会议协定，并宣布将在西伊里安建省。在印度，收复果阿的斗争已成为具有全民规模的运动。在日本，要求摆脱美国控制的爱国独立运动日益发展。所有这一切，说明现在已经是到了彻底废除可耻的殖民主义制度的时候，不论这种制度是用血淋淋的恐怖统治支持着，或者是用军事集团的形式掩盖着的。
    在“万隆精神”的推动下，和平共处五项原则和亚非会议所一致协议的十项原则，得到了日益广泛的支持。这些原则已经成为亚非国家友好团结和增进合作的基础。在过去一年中，继中国、印度、缅甸、越南民主共和国之后，在亚洲国家中又有印度尼西亚、沙特阿拉伯、尼泊尔、阿富汗、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、柬埔寨等，相继宣布了接受和平共处的五项原则，把它们作为指导国与国之间的关系的准则。老挝王国首相富马也宣布要奉行五项原则。事实上，五项原则的实际应用已经超越了亚非地区的范围，得到了世界上许多爱好和平国家和更广泛的社会阶层的承认。一年来，和平中立、不参加军事集团的思想也有了进一步的发展。在这里，人们不能不欢迎锡兰新总理的表示，他宣布锡兰“要采取中立政策，不同任何大国集团结成联盟”。即使在参加了马尼拉条约和巴格达条约的亚洲国家中，要求和平中立和执行独立的外交政策的呼声，也愈来愈高了。美国拼凑军事集团的政策，遭到了亚非国家最尖锐的谴责。“冷战”专家要想继续推销臭名昭著的“实力”政策，现在是愈来愈困难了。
    “万隆精神”加强了亚非国家的团结，从而使亚非国家在国际事务中，发挥着日益重要的作用。现在，凡是同亚非地区有关的重大问题，要是没有亚非国家的参予，就根本不可能得到解决。“万隆精神”不仅是推动亚非局势发展的主导力量，而且在国际事务中到处都能感受到它的影响。例如在联合国第十届大会上，由于亚非国家的努力，使一些尖锐的反殖民主义提案列入了议程，并在人权公约草案中列入了承认民族自决权的条款。
    “万隆精神”的伟大力量，还表现在亚非国家同苏联和人民民主国家的友好关系有了重要的发展。苏联和各人民民主国家在平等互利的基础上，同许多亚非国家进行了经济和文化的交流。特别是苏联、印度、缅甸等国的国家领导人的相互访问，以及苏联对亚洲国家要求国家工业化的愿望的切实支持，为社会制度不同的国家之间实现友好合作树立了良好的榜样。
    中国是亚非会议的参加国之一。在亚非会议上，中国代表团和亚非各国的代表建立了友好的接触。在亚非会议以后，中国一直信守和平共处的五项原则和亚非会议的十项原则，促进同亚非各国的友好团结。一年来，中国和印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚，在维护世界和平的事业中密切合作，我们之间的良好关系，有了进一步的发展。中国和巴基斯坦的友谊，也有了显著的增进。中国和以埃及为首的阿拉伯国家，在政治经济和文化各方面建立了愈来愈多的接触。中国对北非人民为自决和独立而进行的斗争是一贯同情和支持的。中国和柬埔寨王国建立了真诚的友谊。中国人民和日本人民之间，有了比以前多得多的往来和互相了解。我们本着“万隆精神”在发展友好合作方面同各国所作的共同努力对维护和巩固亚非地区的和平有很大的好处。这个事实已经为一切真正关心和平独立事业的国家和人民所承认。
    在纪念亚非会议一周年的时候，中国人民愿意积极努力，进一步加强亚非国家间的友好团结和密切合作。这不仅是中国人民的愿望，也是亚非各国人民的愿望。因为只有加强这种团结和合作，才能有效地摆脱亚非地区在殖民主义长期奴役下所造成的落后状态，才能有效地维护世界和平。亚非国家的团结，并不妨碍它们同其他国家建立和发展良好的关系。只有那些心怀叵测的人，才害怕亚非国家的团结。和平和团结的敌人以及殖民制度的拥护者，一年来一直在咀咒“万隆精神”，千方百计地限制“万隆精神”的发展，并企图加以扼杀。但是历史已经并且还要继续这样地回答他们：这种卑鄙的打算是永远不会实现的；在争取和维护民族独立的斗争，在捍卫世界和平的事业中，亚非人民将越来越团结一致，奋勇前进。
