Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 18th: Chen Yi, head of the Central Delegation and Vice Premier of the State Council, along with the deputy heads of the delegation, visited the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdini at the Norbulingka and Jokhang Temple this afternoon, respectively.

    The Dalai Lama greeted Chen Yi and his party at a palace called "Auspicious Peace." In the garden outside the palace, apple and peach trees were in bloom. Chen Yi thanked the Dalai Lama for the delicious apples he had sent. The Dalai Lama and Chen Yi discussed yesterday's rally welcoming the Central Delegation, and they agreed that it was a symbol of the great unity of all nationalities in the motherland. Chen Yi also spoke about the scenes of the motherland's rapid construction that he had witnessed during his journey through Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, Golmud, and other places. As Chen Yi and his party were taking their leave, the Dalai Lama suggested taking a group photo. They took photos under the blossoming peach and plum trees.

    The Panchen Erdini also had a pleasant conversation with Chen Yi and his party. They talked about the increasing unity between the Tibetan nationality and all nationalities of the motherland, as well as the internal unity of the Tibetan nationality, over the past few years. They also discussed the ancient sites such as the Tang Willow in front of the Jokhang Temple, which is said to have been planted by Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty herself. The Panchen Erdini finally accompanied Chen Yi and his party to view the Tang Willow.

    In their conversations, both the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdini mentioned that the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region would further unify and unite Tibet internally, and that the people's lives would be further improved. They both expressed their gratitude for the Central Delegation's long journey to offer congratulations.

    During the visits, Chen Yi, on behalf of the Central Delegation, presented gifts to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdini.
