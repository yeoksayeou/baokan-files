    Strive to Become a National Model Department Store
    Shanghai No. 1 Department Store plans to expand the variety of goods it carries from around 20,000 to 30,000 by the end of the second quarter. This is an important measure taken by the store's employees, based on the instructions of the Ministry of Commerce, to make the No. 1 Department Store a national model department store.
    The store's purchasing personnel sent to Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou have already purchased many handicrafts and specialty products.
    The store also sends people daily to the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company and the Shanghai Municipal Company of the China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company to select the latest produced fabrics to supply consumers. In the future, this store also plans to ensure that various new daily-use commodities produced in Shanghai can meet customers in the store as soon as they are manufactured.

    争取做全国示范性的百货商店
    上海市第一百货商店计划在第二季度末把所经营的商品从两万种左右扩大到三万种。这是商店的职工根据商业部的指示，把第一百货商店创造成为全国示范性百货商店的重要措施。
    商店派往北京、广州、无锡和常州等地的采购人员，已经买到很多手工艺品和特产品。
    商店还每天派人到中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站和中国花纱布公司上海市公司去选购最新出产的布匹供应消费者。这个商店将来还准备做到使上海生产的各种日用新商品，一经制出，就能在商店的大楼里和顾客见面。（据新华社讯）
