    Opening Address by the Dalai Lama at the Inaugural Meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region

    Fellow committee members, distinguished guests, Vice Premier Chen and all comrades of the Central Delegation:

    First, please allow me, on behalf of all the monks and laypeople of Tibet, to announce that the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is officially open.

    There are fifty-five committee members and two hundred and sixty-nine observers participating in this meeting. Representing all regions, all religious sects, and all social strata of Tibet, everyone is gathered here to discuss major Tibetan affairs. This is the first time in Tibetan history.

    The tasks of our meeting are:

    Announcing the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region;

    Adopting the articles of association of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region;

    Reporting on the work since the peaceful liberation of Tibet;

    Announcing the appointments of the main leaders of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

    This meeting of ours is of great significance. It is convened under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and on the basis of the increasingly consolidated close unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and the internal unity of Tibet. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region marks that the work in the Tibetan region has entered a new stage. In the future, Tibet will be more united and progressive, realize a unified autonomous region, and, in combination with the specific conditions of Tibet and the will and wishes of Tibetan leaders and the broad masses of the people, gradually carry out democratic reforms and social reforms.

    Our task is: to unite all the monks and laypeople of Tibet, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, to gradually develop Tibet's politics, economy, and culture, consolidate national defense, and strive to build a new Tibet with flourishing politics and religion, prosperity, and happiness.

    Because our meeting has the direct leadership of the Central Delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi, I believe it will definitely be a success. We wholeheartedly thank the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao for their kind concern and care for the Tibetan people. We wholeheartedly support the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government on national regional autonomy, national equality, unity, and protection of freedom of religious belief.

    I wish our meeting a complete success!

    May the Tibetan people be forever united and progressive!

    Long live the great unity of all nationalities in China!

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities!
