    Keeping Over a Million Eggs Intact

    An advanced unit that acquired and stored more than 1.54 million eggs without any breakage has been awarded the title of First-Class Advanced Group at the Jiangsu Provincial Commercial Advanced Workers' Representative Conference. This unit is the fresh egg outlet of the Libao Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Food Company, Hai'an County.

    Employees of the Libao Purchasing and Supply Station use different packaging and storage methods for eggs depending on the season. In summer and autumn, when eggshells are thin and easily broken, they pack the eggs with the large end up, standing upright in the baskets, and install air cylinders in the egg baskets to ventilate and dissipate heat, preventing the eggs from deteriorating. During the plum rain season, they place wooden boards under the egg baskets to protect the eggs from moisture. In extremely cold weather, they use straw to keep them warm and prevent them from freezing and cracking.

    保管一百多万个鸡蛋一个不破
    一个收购保管154万多个鸡蛋没有发生破损的先进单位，在江苏省商业先进工作者代表会议上获得一等先进小组的称号。这个单位是中国食品公司海安县李堡收购供应站鲜蛋门市部。
    李堡收购供应站的职工，根据不同季节，用不同的包装保管方法保管鸡蛋。夏、秋两季蛋壳薄，容易破损，他们在包装时就把鸡蛋大头朝上，直立篓中，并且在蛋篓中装置汽筒，以通风散热，使鸡蛋不变质；在梅雨季节，他们在蛋篓下架起木板，使鸡蛋不受潮湿影响；在酷冷天气就用稻草保暖，不使鸡蛋冻裂。
