　　Since the beginning of spring, industrial workers in some parts of Jiangsu Province have been leaving factories and returning to the countryside. In Huashu District of Jiangyin County, 33 out of 55 workers from three rice mills have already returned home. The situation is even more serious in factories with seasonal production. The Xinhua Oil Factory in Xin Hai Lian City has been forced to stop production due to workers returning home. The task of the Xuzhou Brick and Tile Factory has increased three times compared to last year, but 265 seasonal workers have not returned to the factory to produce. This situation seriously affects the completion of industrial production plans.

　　This situation has emerged after agricultural cooperativization. Some workers yearn for the thriving atmosphere in the countryside, but lack sufficient understanding of the development prospects of industrial production. In addition, they have heard exaggerated propaganda from some rural staff about the particularly generous remuneration for workdays in agricultural cooperatives, and thus want to return home to engage in agricultural production.

　　Some rural staff members tell seasonal workers: "You must either commit to farming or commit to working, you cannot 'ride two boats'." Some people, regardless of the actual needs of factories, forcefully drag workers to participate in agricultural production. For example, the People's Committee of Fangchan Township in Pei County sent people to the Xuzhou Brick and Tile Factory and told the sixteen workers from the township: "Your families have joined advanced cooperatives. Your presence in the factory affects agricultural production. You must return home immediately, otherwise you will be treated as non-agricultural households, your land will be allocated to others, and grain will no longer be supplied." The workers immediately requested to return home. The Tongshan County People's Committee also sent a letter to the factory to "transfer" Dong Youliang and other five permanent workers back to their hometown for production.

　　In some factories, workers' wages are generally low, working conditions and welfare work are also poor, and the factory leaders do not care about workers' lives. This is also a reason why workers want to return to the countryside.

　　After the realization of agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production cooperatives should tap internal potential to solve the labor force problem, and should not forcefully drag workers back to their hometown for production. In industrial and mining enterprises, especially in those enterprises where workers have already requested to return to the countryside, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for workers in conjunction with the development of advanced producer movements. For seasonal workers, contracts should be signed with agricultural cooperatives in accordance with the original habits to ensure that they engage in part-time work and part-time farming production. The issues of employees' wages, welfare, and working conditions should also be actively and gradually resolved on the basis of production development.

    不要强拉硬拖工人回农村
    苏宁
    入春以来，江苏省部分地方工业工人纷纷离开工厂回农村去了。江阴县华墅区三个米厂共有五十五个工人，现在已经回乡的有三十三人。在那些生产带季节性的工厂中，工人回乡的情况就更为严重。新海连市的新海油厂已经因为工人回乡而被迫停止生产。徐州砖瓦窑厂今年的任务比去年的增加了三倍，现在有265个季节工人没回厂生产。这种情况，严重地影响了工业生产计划的完成。
    这种情况，是在农业合作化以后出现的。一部分工人响往农村中欣欣向荣的气象，而对于工业生产的发展前途则认识不足，加上听到某些农村工作人员对农业合作社劳动日的报酬特别优厚的夸大宣传，就要回乡从事农业生产。
    部分农村工作人员，对季节性的工人说：“要就固定务农，要就固定做工，不得‘脚踏两条船’”。有些人不顾工厂实际需要，强拉硬拖工人参加农业生产。如沛县房产乡人民委员会派人到徐州砖瓦窑厂去，对家住在该乡的十六个工人说：“你们家里参加了高级社，你们在厂里影响农业生产，要立即回家，不然以非农业户对待，土地分给别人，粮食不再供应。”工人立即提出了回乡的要求。铜山县人民委员会也派人拿公函到这个厂“调”董友良等五个固定工人回乡生产。
    有些工厂，工人的工资一般比较低，劳动条件和福利工作也比较差，工厂的领导人又不关心工人生活，这也是引起工人要回农村的一个原因。
    实现农业合作化以后，农业生产合作社应该挖掘内部潜力来解决劳动力的问题，不应该强拖硬拉工人回乡生产。在工矿企业，特别在那些已经有工人要求回农村的企业里，应该结合开展先进生产者运动，加强对工人的思想教育，对于季节性工人，应该按照原有的习惯，同农业合作社签订合同，确保他们从事半工半农生产。对于职工的工资、福利和劳动条件等问题，也要在生产发展的基础上，积极地逐步地加以解决。
