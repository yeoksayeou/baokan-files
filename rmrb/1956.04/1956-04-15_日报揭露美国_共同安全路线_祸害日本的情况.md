    People's Daily Exposes How the U.S. "Common Security Route" Harms Japan

    (Report from this newspaper) The Japanese newspaper "Hokkaido Shimbun" published an article on March 17 entitled "The Future of Japan-U.S. Relations," which exposed how the so-called Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement is harming Japan.

    The author of the article said that the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement is actually just "a collection of several U.S. domestic laws," and "both politically and economically, it is something meticulously planned." First of all, this agreement stipulates that Japan "must purchase surplus agricultural products" according to the U.S. domestic "Act to Promote Disposal of Surplus Agricultural Commodities," and must "purchase more surplus agricultural products without reducing normal imports; if it cannot be purchased this year, it must be purchased next year." Even after "the United States stops supplying student meals, the Japanese government will continue to supply them, forcing the Japanese to develop the habit of eating American bread and milk, and using such methods to force the sale of surplus agricultural products to Japan, which has the consequence of cooling relations between Japan and agricultural product exporting countries such as Canada, Australia, Argentina, Burma, Thailand, Egypt, Pakistan, and Denmark."

    The agreement also stipulates that this purchase must "not harm American trade," so according to the U.S. "Buy American Act" and "Cargo Preference Act," it stipulates that "more than half of the purchased surplus agricultural products must be transported by American ships." Furthermore, according to the "Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act," the "Battle Act," and the "Trading with the Enemy Act," Japan is "not allowed to do business with Communist countries." In addition to forcing Japan to comply with the regulations of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), the (U.S. – editor) embassy’s secretaries have "repeatedly made verbal suggestions: Shareholders of companies that have traded with Communist China are not allowed to go to the United States or have their assets in the United States frozen. In addition, a certificate is required for exports to the United States, proving that no raw materials produced in Communist China were used. Due to incomplete documents, Japanese residents in the United States were unable to drink miso soup during the New Year." As a result, "small and medium-sized enterprises hoped to exhibit embargoed goods such as steel and machinery at the Japanese commodity exhibitions held in Beijing and Shanghai this fall, but their hopes were kicked away by the government due to opposition from large companies fearing obstruction of trade with the United States." Finally, the agreement also stipulates, according to the "Mutual Security Act," that Japan must use U.S. loans to Japan "to expand anti-communist forces."

    According to the author's rough calculation, the "benefit" Japan receives after enduring these harsh conditions is that "from 1950 to 1954, the U.S. aid to Japan was 117.5 billion yen in semi-obsolete weapons provided under the Mutual Security Act, 3.6 billion yen in wheat funds provided under the Mutual Security Act, 14.5 billion yen in World Bank loans, 26.8 billion yen in the first surplus agricultural products, 103.68 billion yen in special procurement orders, and 58.3 billion yen in aid for occupied areas' administration and relief programs, totaling 1257.5 billion yen. This is the income. Japan's burden is 848.4 billion yen in post-war settlement expenses and defense costs, plus a minimum estimate of 20 billion yen per year in losses due to the inability to trade with Communist China and the necessity to import expensive materials, totaling 948.4 billion yen. The surplus is only about 300 billion yen. Similarly, a rough calculation of the income and expenditure for the six years from 1955 to 1960 shows a surplus of only about 250 billion yen. If the purchase of surplus agricultural products and the reduction of defense burden sharing cannot be carried out smoothly, there is even the possibility of a deficit. The loss caused by the domestic development and the export capacity of peaceful industries being swallowed up by the defense industry is immeasurable." Due to this series of facts, the author of the article finally had to say, in a roundabout but firm way: "I am not saying that we should fight with the United States in order to take the Asian route. But at least it seems necessary to simply abolish this common security route that has festered politically, economically, and socially."

    日报揭露美国“共同安全路线”祸害日本的情况
    本报讯　三月十七日日本报纸“北海道新闻”刊载了一篇题为：“日美关系的前途”的文章，揭穿了所谓共同防御援助协定祸害日本的情况。
    文章的作者说，共同防御援助协定实际上只不过是“美国的几个国内法案拼凑起来的东西”，“不论在政治上还是经济上都是些用心周到的东西”。首先这个协定根据美国国内的“促进剩余农产品处理法”，规定日本“一定要购买多余的农产品”，并且必须在“不削减平时进口量而多多地购买剩余农产品，本年度内买不了明年一定要买”，甚至在“美国停止供给学生伙食的赠送以后，由日本政府继续供给，强迫日本人养成吃美国的面包和牛奶的习惯，用这样一些办法来把剩余农产品强售给日本，其后果，使日本和加拿大、澳大利亚、阿根廷、缅甸、泰国、埃及、巴基斯坦和丹麦等输出农产品国家之间的关系冷淡起来。”
    协定又规定这种购买必须“不损害美国的买卖”，因此它又根据美国的“优先购进美货法”和“保护美轮承运法”，规定了“购买的剩余农产品半数以上用美国船运输”。并且还根据“共同防御援助管理法”、“巴特尔法”和“敌国财产管理法”规定日本“不准和共产党国家做生意”，除了强迫日本遵守所谓巴黎统筹委员会的管制以外，还“屡次由（美国—编者）大使馆的秘书级人物用口头提出建议：不准那些和共产党中国做过贸易的公司的股东去美国或冻结他们在美国的财产。此外，在对美输出方面需要一张证明书，证明：没有使用共产党中国出产的原料。由于文件不完备，竟使在美日侨在正月里没有喝到豆酱汤。”其结果是，“中小企业希望今年秋天在北京和上海举行的日本商品展览会上展出钢铁和机器等禁运商品，但是由于遭到害怕阻挠对美贸易的大公司的反对，中小企业的希望被政府一脚踢开了。”最后，协定还根据“共同安全法”规定日本必须把美国贷给日本的“贷款用来扩大反共军队”。
    根据作者的概略计算，日本在忍受这种种苛刻的条件后所得到的“好处”是，“从1950年到1954年，美国给予日本的援助是，根据共同安全法提供的半旧武器一千一百七十五亿日元，根据共同安全法提供的小麦资金三十六亿日元，世界银行贷款一百四十五亿日元，第一次剩余农产品二百六十八亿日元，特需订货一万零三百六十八亿日元，占领地区行政及救济计划援助五百八十三亿日元，总共一万二千五百七十五亿日元。这是收入。日本方面的负担是，终战处理费和防卫费八千四百八十四亿日元，加上最低的估计——由于被禁止对中共进行贸易而不得不输入昂贵的物资所造成的损失每年为二百亿日元，共达九千四百八十四亿日元。结余只有三千亿日元左右。同样把从1955年到1960年的六年间的收支略算一下，结余也不过是二千五百亿日元左右。如果购买剩余农产品和削减防卫分担费一事不能如意进行，甚至有发生赤字的可能。至于因国内的开发和和平产业的输出余力被防卫产业所吞并而产生的损失是不可计量的。”由于这一连串的事实，使得文章的作者最后不得不委婉而又坚定地说：“我不是说为了走亚洲路线而要和美国打架。但是至少好像有必要干脆废除在政治上、经济上、社会上已经长了脓疮的这个共同安全路线。”
