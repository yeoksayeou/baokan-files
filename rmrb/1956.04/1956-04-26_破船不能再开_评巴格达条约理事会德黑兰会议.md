    A Broken Ship Cannot Sail Again
    A Commentary on the Baghdad Pact Council's Tehran Meeting
    Cui Qi
    The Standing Council of the Baghdad Pact, comprising Britain, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan, recently held its second meeting in Tehran. For the creators of this military aggression bloc, the Tehran meeting took place under rather bleak circumstances. The Baghdad Pact has been met with increasingly fierce criticism and resistance from the broad masses of the Asian and African people, the Western colonialists' plans to continuously expand this treaty have been disrupted, and the very foundation of the Baghdad Pact is being shaken. It is impossible to fundamentally deny these facts; the Tehran meeting's communiqué also acknowledged that the Baghdad Pact had been subjected to criticism and attacks from "neutral parties and other parties." However, the creators of the Baghdad Pact did not draw any beneficial conclusions from this, but rather tried their best to defend themselves and futilely "hoped...that these criticisms would disappear and turn into sympathy" (?). At the same time, they recklessly decided to "take urgent steps to strengthen this treaty," including further implementation of measures to "defend" the Baghdad Pact area, which means requiring the contracting states to tighten their belts and accelerate their arms expansion and war preparations. The Tehran meeting showed that the Western colonialists want to salvage the bankruptcy of the Baghdad Pact in order to continue pursuing a policy of strength and maintaining the colonial system in the Near and Middle East.
    The United States participated in the Tehran meeting and played an important role. The American "observer group," led by US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson and US Commander of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Naval Forces Cassady, was even larger than the delegations of the Baghdad Pact participating countries. During the meeting, Henderson expressed the United States' "unconditional support" for the Baghdad Pact and announced that the United States had decided to join the Baghdad Pact's two committees – the Economic Committee and the so-called Anti-Subversion Committee. In addition, the United States will also establish a military liaison office co-located with the Baghdad Pact's permanent headquarters. It is not surprising that the United States is further participating in the actual activities of the Baghdad Pact organization. This treaty was originally planned by the United States. The reason why the United States has been slow to formally join, and instead has been operating behind the scenes, is partly to facilitate dragging more Near and Middle Eastern countries into this treaty, and partly to avoid the storm of opposition to the Baghdad Pact from hitting itself. However, now the curtain has been lifted, and the United States has effectively joined the Baghdad Pact. The Associated Press also said that the United States' current actions are "a method of entering the alliance through the back door."
    The further participation of the United States in the activities of the Baghdad Pact organization is also the result of a diplomatic deal between the United States and Britain. In recent months, due to the surging development of the anti-colonialist movement of the people in the Near and Middle East, the colonial positions of the Western colonial countries, especially Britain, in the Near and Middle East have been severely hit. In order to save the crisis of its colonial policy and maintain its vested positions, Britain has demanded that the United States contribute more strength to share the risks with Britain, especially requiring the United States to join the Baghdad Pact. On the other hand, however, the United States has in turn accused Britain of not fully supporting its policies in the Far East. Therefore, Western news agencies reported before the US-UK Washington talks that the meeting would negotiate issues such as: "Britain guarantees to support the United States in the Far East, and the United States guarantees to support Britain in the Middle East." Recently, people have indeed seen that Britain has yielded to US pressure, abandoning its just stance that it should have taken in Indochina, and condoning the illegal actions of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem government in undermining the Geneva Accords.
    However, this does not mean that the contradictions between Britain and the United States in the Near and Middle East have been alleviated. The opposite is true. It would be a big mistake if someone thought that the United States' further participation in the activities of the Baghdad Pact organization was to help Britain. Both Britain and the United States are pursuing their own goals, and precisely because of this, the conflicts of interest between them are irreconcilable. The more Britain wants to rely on the United States to maintain its colonial position in the Near and Middle East, the more the United States feels that there is an opportunity to be seized, demanding to replace Britain's position. The United Press International openly said when talking about the situation in the Near and Middle East, "The Americans believe that Britain has already failed in many places, and there is only one path left: to make the United Kingdom accept the United States' leadership in implementing Western policy in the region." The Washington "Star" wrote even more bluntly on April 4th: "Due to Britain's setbacks,... the United States has replaced Britain as the defender of Western interests in the Middle East."
    In order to conceal the military nature of the Baghdad Pact and appease certain Asian countries participating in this treaty, the United States and Britain both expressed at the Tehran meeting that they would strengthen economic and technical "assistance" to these countries. Here too there is a contradiction between Britain and the United States. Britain has long been asking the United States to contribute more money to support the Baghdad Pact, but US officials recently declared that US "assistance" will be carried out through "bilateral" channels, rather than through the Baghdad Pact itself. It is very clear that the United States is doing this in order to facilitate its own economic expansion. This infighting between Britain and the United States shows that neither of them sincerely wants to assist the Near and Middle Eastern countries, but are competing to maintain and strengthen their respective colonial plunder in the name of "assistance."
    Precisely because of this, the economic situation of those Asian countries that have participated in the Baghdad Pact and received Western "assistance" in recent years has not improved, but has generally deteriorated. Let's take a look at Turkey. Because Turkey follows the policy of arms expansion and war preparations, and because its economic interests and sovereignty have been seriously violated, its fiscal deficits and trade deficits are expanding, inflation is rising, prices are rising, industry is stagnating, and agricultural production is also declining. The Washington "Star" wrote on April 10th: "Turkey's difficulties are not a very closely guarded secret," "Suspicion of the Washington government's goodwill has penetrated the minds of Turkish government officials and other people who painfully understand their own country's bankruptcy crisis. Talk about neutralism can be heard not only among some government officials, but also in newspapers and among people drinking sweet Turkish coffee in cafes." On April 18th, an Associated Press reporter reported from Istanbul that Turkish opposition leaders and most newspapers are increasingly criticizing the current government's "policy of leading Turkey into a serious economic predicament." This Associated Press reporter believes: "A very fierce movement is already developing, with a high risk of a political explosion occurring in this country."
    The facts in Turkey show that participating in Western military blocs is absolutely incompatible with the national interests of the Near and Middle Eastern countries. Therefore, not only those Near and Middle Eastern countries that adhere to a policy of peace and independence oppose the Baghdad Pact, but also within certain Asian countries that have participated in the Baghdad Pact, the forces opposing this treaty are growing.
    The broad masses of the people in the Near and Middle East have seen clearly the colonial and aggressive nature of the Baghdad Pact, and they will fight to the end against this treaty. This is doomed to the final bankruptcy of the Baghdad Pact. Not long ago, the US "Christian Science Monitor" admitted: "The Baghdad Pact is almost exploding in the faces of its creators." The French "Le Monde" put it well, the Baghdad Pact has now become a "broken ship." Yes, neither Britain nor the United States can save the final bankruptcy of the Baghdad Pact, just as neither of them can save the final bankruptcy of the "policy of strength" and the colonial system. A broken ship cannot sail again.

    破船不能再开
    评巴格达条约理事会德黑兰会议
    崔奇
    有英国、土耳其、伊拉克、伊朗和巴基斯坦五国参加的巴格达条约常设理事会，最近在德黑兰举行了第二次会议。对于这个军事侵略集团的制造者来说，德黑兰会议是在十分暗淡的景况下召开的。巴格达条约遭到亚非广大人民越来越猛烈的抨击和反抗，西方殖民者想要不断扩大这个条约的计划已经被打乱了，而且巴格达条约本身的基础也在发生动摇。要想根本否认这些事实是不可能的；德黑兰会议公报也承认，巴格达条约受到了“中立方面和其他方面”的批评和抨击。但是，巴格达条约的制造者并未由此得出任何有益的结论，而是竭力进行辩解，并且徒然地“希望……这些批评将消失而变成同情”（？）同时他们更不顾一切地决定“采取迫切步骤来加强这个条约”，其中包括进一步实施“保卫”巴格达条约地区的措施，也就是要求缔约国勒紧腰带，加速扩军备战。德黑兰会议表明，西方殖民者想要挽救巴格达条约的破产，以便在中近东地区继续推行实力政策和维护殖民制度。
    美国参加了德黑兰会议，并且担当了一个重要的角色。以美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊和美国东大西洋和地中海海军司令卡塞迪为首的美国“观察组”，竟比巴格达条约参加国各代表团还要庞大。汉德逊在会议期间表示了美国对巴格达条约的“无条件的支持”，并宣布美国决定加入巴格达条约的两个委员会——经济委员会和所谓反颠复委员会。此外，美国还将设立一个同巴格达条约常设总部在一起的军事联络处。美国进一步参加巴格达条约组织的实际活动，这是不足为奇的。这个条约最初本来就是美国策划的。美国所以迟迟没有正式加入，而躲在幕后活动，一则为了便于把更多的中近东国家拖进这个条约，二则为了避免反对巴格达条约的风浪打到自己的身上来。可是，现在幕布已经揭开了，美国实际上已经参加了巴格达条约。美联社也说，美国现在的行动是“一种从后门进入联盟的方法”。
    美国进一步参加巴格达条约组织的活动，也是美国和英国之间进行的一笔外交交易的结果。近几个月来，由于中近东人民的反殖民主义运动的汹涌发展，西方殖民国家，首先是英国在中近东的殖民地位遭到了沉重的打击，英国为了挽救它的殖民政策的危机，保持它的既得阵地，就要求美国拿出更多的力量同英国共同担当风险，特别是要求美国加入巴格达条约。但另一方面，美国却反过来指责英国没有充分支持它在远东的政策。因此，西方通讯社在美英华盛顿会谈前报道说，会议将谈判这样的问题：“英国保证在远东支持美国，而美国保证在中东支持英国”。最近，人们的确看到，英国向美国压力让步，放弃了它在印度支那应该采取的公正立场，而纵容美国和吴庭艳政府破坏日内瓦协议的非法行为。
    但是，这并不是说英美之间在中近东的矛盾就得到了缓和。事实恰恰相反。如果有人以为美国进一步参加巴格达条约组织的活动是为了帮助英国，那就大错而特错了。不论英国还是美国都是追求各自的目的，正因为这样，它们之间的利害矛盾是不可调和的。英国越是想依靠美国来保持它在中近东的殖民地位，那末美国就越感到有机可乘，要求代替英国的地位。合众社在谈到中近东局势时公开说，“美国人认为英国已经在好多地方失败了，只剩下一条路可走：使联合王国接受美国在该地区执行西方政策方面的领导权。”四月四日华盛顿“明星报”更露骨地写道：“由于英国遭到了挫折，……美国已经代替英国而成为西方在中东地区的利益的保卫者了。”
    为了掩饰巴格达条约的军事性质，并安抚参加这个条约的某些亚洲国家，美国和英国在德黑兰会议上都表示要加强对这些国家的经济和技术“援助”。在这里也同样存在着英美之间的矛盾。英国好久以来就要求美国多出些钱来支援巴格达条约，但是美国官员最近却宣称，美国的“援助”将通过“双边”的途径来进行，而不通过巴格达条约本身。很显然，美国这样做法是为了便于进行它自己的经济扩张。英美之间的这种勾心斗角说明了，它们之中谁也不是真心要援助中近东国家，而是竞相以“援助”为名来维持和加强它们各自的殖民掠夺。
    正是因为这样，近年来那些参加巴格达条约并得到西方“援助”的亚洲国家的经济情况，不但没有改善，反而普遍地恶化了。我们来看一看土耳其吧。土耳其由于追随扩军备战政策，由于它的经济利益和主权遭到严重侵犯，它的财政赤字和贸易逆差在扩大，通货膨胀，物价上涨，工业停滞不前，农业生产也在下降。华盛顿“明星报”四月十日写道：“土耳其的困难并不是一种保守得很严密的秘密”，“对于华盛顿政府的善意的怀疑，已经深入土耳其政府官员和痛苦地了解到他们自己国家的破产危机的其他人们的心中。关于中立主义的谈话，不仅可以在某些政府人士中听到，也可以从报纸中以及在咖啡馆中喝着甜融融的土耳其咖啡的人们中间听到了。”四月十八日，美联社记者发自伊斯坦布尔的报道也说，土耳其反对派领袖和大部分报纸正以日益加剧之势抨击现政府“把土耳其导入严重经济困境的政策”。这个美联社记者认为：“一个十分激烈的运动已经在发展着，大有在这个国家发生政治爆炸的危险。”
    土耳其的事实说明了，参加西方军事集团是同中近东国家的民族利益绝对不相容的。因此，现在不仅那些坚持和平独立政策的中近东国家反对巴格达条约，而且在参加了巴格达条约的某些亚洲国家内部，反对这个条约的力量也正在增长。
    中近东广大人民已经看清巴格达条约的殖民侵略的本质，他们将为反对这个条约而斗争到底。这就注定了巴格达条约的最后破产。不久以前，美国“基督教科学箴言报”承认：“巴格达条约几乎是在它的缔造者面前爆炸开了。”法国“世界报”说得好，巴格达条约现在已经变成一只“破船”。是的，不论英国还是美国，谁也不能挽救巴格达条约的最后破产，正同它们谁也不能挽救“实力政策”和殖民制度的最后破产一样。破船是不能再开了。
