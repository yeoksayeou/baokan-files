Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 9th: Phnom Penh dispatch: Cambodian State Secretary for Information and Religion, Trinh Hoanh, read a letter from former Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk to the Cambodian people on Phnom Penh Radio on April 8th.

Sihanouk said in his letter that the current situation in Cambodia is complex. He said that although some powerful countries speak ill of the policies adopted by the Kingdom of Cambodia, some countries that love peace and oppose war support Cambodia and praise the spirit of the Cambodian nation in resolutely following correct policies.

Sihanouk expressed his gratitude in that letter to the Cambodian people for asking him to reassume power to defend the country's independence, neutrality, and peace. Sihanouk said that although he is now outside the government, he will at any time provide advice to the government in the name of the Supreme Advisor of the People's Socialist Community, so as not to let the current government violate the interests of the nation.

Sihanouk also mentioned that the King of Cambodia had approved his resignation from the post of Cambodian representative to the United Nations.
