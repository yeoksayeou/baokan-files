Comrades, Friends!

	Today is the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference, a day marking the unity and victory of the Asian and African peoples. Like the people of all Asian and African countries, we, the Chinese people, are celebrating this historically significant day with particular excitement. Over the past year, the influence of the Asian-African Conference has increasingly penetrated the hearts of the people. The "Bandung Spirit" is advancing victoriously. Whether in the movement against colonialism and for national independence, or in the struggle to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace, or to establish and develop friendly relations between Asian and African countries, the "Bandung Spirit" is playing an ever more important role. Today, as we celebrate the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference here, we should first of all express our gratitude to the five initiating countries, Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, for their initiative and efforts in convening the Asian-African Conference. We should also mention the outstanding efforts made by President Sukarno and Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo of the Republic of Indonesia in arranging and hosting the conference, as well as the outstanding contributions made by Prime Minister Nehru of the Republic of India, Prime Minister U Nu of the Union of Burma, and President Nasser of the Republic of Egypt to ensure the smooth progress of the conference. At the same time, we should also express our gratitude to the many countries and peoples who warmly supported the Asian-African Conference.

	Dear Comrades and Friends! The development of the Asian-African situation over the past year is encouraging. The Asian and African peoples have continuously achieved new victories in their struggle for peace, independence, and friendship

	In Asia, the great Republic of India, our great neighbor, is playing an increasingly important role as a world power in international affairs. India, Burma, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nepal, Ceylon, and other countries are resolutely pursuing a policy of peace, expanding the zone of peace in Asia, and easing international tensions. The military aggression blocs organized by colonialism in Asia have met with increasing opposition from the people of Asian countries. The awakened Asian people, and even the leaders of many countries, have gradually seen through the colonialist nature of these military treaties. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru said, "Asia has entered a new century, and others can no longer decide its destiny. The days when Europeans or Americans could decide the fate of Asian and African countries are gone forever." In the Middle East, the Republic of Egypt has achieved significant achievements in its heroic struggle to safeguard national independence and international peace. Recently, Prime Minister Nasser stated that "Egypt will not participate in any sphere of influence controlled by foreign powers"; he also said, "Our current goal is to move forward as an independent, free, and progressive nation," which reflects the firm will of the vast Egyptian people to safeguard independence and peace. The friendly unity of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and other countries in this struggle is constantly strengthening. The threat of foreign interventionists to the Middle East is increasingly met with strong resistance from the local people. On the African continent, we also see historic changes. The vast African people have awakened, and the people in many regions of Africa are carrying out a heroic struggle against colonialism. The struggle of the people of Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia for independence and freedom has been victorious. All these facts show that the nations in the vast Asian and African regions are advancing in the direction indicated by the Bandung Conference, and the people who account for two-thirds of the world's population are determined to take their destiny into their own hands.

	The Asian and African countries that have gained political independence generally demand to establish their own independent economies and improve the living standards of their people. As everyone knows, in the past, the vast majority of these Asian and African countries were objects of exploitation by Western colonial countries. Even after they achieved political independence, they often had to sacrifice the freedom and sovereignty they had regained in exchange for the so-called economic assistance from colonial countries. However, this situation has undergone fundamental changes. Due to the development of economic cooperation between socialist countries and Asian and African countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, it has become increasingly difficult for colonial countries to continue to carry out unrestricted exploitation of backward countries.

	The people of Asian and African countries resolutely oppose the racial, political, economic, and cultural discrimination that a few colonialists have long imposed on them, but they have no intention of discriminating against anyone in any way. The people of Asian and African countries resolutely advocate friendly cooperation with each other based on the ten principles of the Asian-African Conference, which have developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but the friendly cooperation of Asian and African countries does not exclude their friendly cooperation with any country in other regions of the world. Facts have proved that the friendly cooperation of Asian and African countries is an important factor in promoting world peace and cooperation.

	Over the past year, the friendly cooperative relations between Asian and African countries have greatly developed. China has adhered to the ten principles of the Asian-African Conference. In order to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, China has made unremitting efforts. After the Asian-African Conference, we increased friendly exchanges with many Asian and African countries, strengthening and improving our relations with each other. As everyone can see, our efforts in this regard have been fruitful over the past year. However, our efforts are not enough, and we will redouble our efforts in the future to strengthen friendly cooperation with Asian and African countries.

	The facts of the past year have proved that the convening of the Asian-African Conference is entirely in line with the wishes of the Asian and African peoples and the interests of world peace and cooperation. It has played and will continue to play an increasingly profound and significant role in the great cause of the Asian and African peoples for peace, independence, and friendship. However, we cannot fail to note that peace has not yet been consolidated, the independence aspirations of many Asian and African peoples have not yet been realized, and the national rights of many Asian and African peoples have not yet received due respect. At the same time, the colonialists are not reconciled to their failures in the Asian and African regions. Therefore, in order to realize the lofty ideals of the Asian-African Conference, Asian and African countries still have to make persistent efforts. Recently, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo of the Republic of Indonesia mentioned in his policy statement that the possibility of convening a second Asian-African Conference should be considered at an appropriate time, in harmony with the international environment and atmosphere. We believe that this suggestion is welcome.

	Comrades, friends, it is the first anniversary of the Asian-African Conference. Our Asian and African countries have achieved many great successes in all aspects. Although the colonialists are still using various conspiracies and tricks to undermine the unity of the Asian and African peoples, it is impossible to reverse the wheels of history in this new era of the awakening of the Asian and African peoples and all oppressed nations. The Asian and African peoples have achieved great victories and will achieve even greater victories. This is something that no force can stop.

	We, the Chinese people, sincerely hope to further strengthen friendly cooperative relations with Asian and African countries, and continue to strive together to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, to strive for the happiness of the Asian and African peoples, and to strengthen peace in Asia and the world.

	Long live the independence, freedom, and friendly unity of the Asian and African nations!
	Long live world peace and international cooperation!

    在北京庆祝亚非会议一周年大会上
    贺龙副总理的讲话同志们、朋友们！
    今天是亚非会议的一周年，这是标志着亚非人民的团结和胜利的日子。同亚非各国的人民一样，我们中国人民怀着特别兴奋的心情，庆祝这个具有历史意义的日子。一年以来，亚非会议的影响已日益深入人心。“万隆精神”正在胜利地前进着。无论在反对殖民主义和要求民族独立的运动中，或者在缓和国际紧张局势、维护世界和平的斗争中，在建立和发展亚非各国的友好关系中，“万隆精神”都起着越来越重要的作用。今天，当我们在这里庆祝亚非会议一周年的时候，我们首先应该对缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦五个发起国对召开亚非会议的倡议和努力表示感谢，我们也应该提到印度尼西亚共和国苏加诺总统和阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理对于安排和主持会议所作的卓越的努力，印度共和国尼赫鲁总理、缅甸联邦吴努总理和埃及共和国纳赛尔总理为了使会议得以顺利进行所作的卓越的贡献。同时，我们还应该对热烈支持亚非会议的许多国家和人民表示感谢。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！一年来亚非形势的发展，是令人鼓舞的。亚非人民在争取和平、独立和友好的斗争中，不断得到了新的胜利。
    在亚洲方面，我们伟大的邻邦印度共和国，在国际事务中正起着一个世界大国的日益重要的作用。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、阿富汗、柬埔寨、尼泊尔、锡兰和其他国家坚决地执行着和平政策，扩大了亚洲的和平地区，和缓了国际紧张局势。殖民主义在亚洲组织的军事侵略集团遭到了亚洲各国人民的日益强烈的反对。觉醒了的亚洲人民，甚至许多国家的领导人物，已经逐渐看穿了这些军事条约的殖民主义的实质。正如印度总理尼赫鲁所说：“亚洲已进入新的世纪，其他人再也不能决定它的命运了，欧洲人或美洲人能够决定亚非国家的命运的日子已经一去不返了”。在中近东，埃及共和国，在维护民族独立和国际和平的英勇斗争中取得了重大的成就。最近纳赛尔总理表示“埃及将不参加任何外国所控制的势力范围”；他又说“我们当前的目标是要作为一个独立、自由和进步的国家向前挺进”，这反映了广大的埃及人民维护独立和和平的坚强意志。埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、约旦和其他国家在这一斗争中的友好团结正在不断地加强。外国干涉者对中东的威胁日益受到了当地人民的强烈反抗。在非洲大陆上我们也看到历史性的变化，广大的非洲人民已经觉醒，非洲许多地区的人民正在进行着反对殖民主义的英勇斗争，苏丹、摩洛哥和突尼斯三国人民争取独立、自由的斗争，已经得到了胜利。这一切事实都说明了：在广大的亚非地区的各民族正在向着万隆会议所指示的方向前进，占世界人口三分之二的人民已经决心要把他们的命运掌握在自己的手中。
    在政治上获得独立的亚非各国，普遍要求建立自己的独立的经济和改善人民生活的水平。大家知道，亚非这些国家在以往的历史中，绝大多数都是西方殖民国家的剥削对象。即便是在他们取得了政治独立之后，他们往往不得不牺牲自己争回的自由和主权去换取殖民国家的所谓经济援助，但是，现在这种情况已经起了根本的变化。由于社会主义国家和亚非各国在平等互利基础上的经济合作的发展，殖民国家要想对落后国家继续进行无限制的榨取，已经日益困难了。
    亚非各国人民坚决反对少数殖民主义者长期以来就强加在他们头上的种族、政治、经济和文化各方面的歧视，但是他们却无意在任何方面歧视任何人。亚非各国人民坚决主张彼此之间根据在和平共处五项原则基础上发展起来的亚非会议的十项原则友好合作，但是亚非各国的友好合作绝不排斥他们同世界其他地区的任何国家进行友好合作。事实证明，亚非各国人民的友好合作是促进世界和平和合作的一个重要因素。
    一年以来，亚非各国之间的友好合作关系有了很大的发展，中国信守亚非会议的十项原则。为了贯彻亚非会议的决议，中国作了不懈的努力。在亚非会议之后，我们增加了同许多亚非国家的友好往来，加强和改善了我们彼此之间的关系。大家可以看到，一年来我们在这方面的努力是有成就的。但是，我们的努力还是不够的，今后我们将加倍努力来加强同亚非国家的友好合作。
    一年来的事实证明，亚非会议的召开是完全符合亚非人民的愿望和世界和平和合作的利益的，它已经在和将要在亚非人民争取和平、独立和友好的伟大事业中起着日益深远的巨大的作用。但是我们不能不注意到和平尚未巩固，很多亚非人民的独立愿望还未实现，很多亚非人民的民族权利还未受到应有的尊重，而同时殖民主义者还不甘心于他们在亚非地区的失败，因此，为了实现亚非会议的崇高理想，亚非各国还要作坚持不懈的努力。最近，印度尼西亚共和国总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约在他的施政纲领的声明里提到，在适当的时候，在同国际环境和国际空气调和的情况下，应该考虑召开第二次亚非会议的可能性问题；我们认为，这个意见是值得欢迎的。
    同志们，朋友们，亚非会议一周年了 ，我们亚非国家在各方面取得了很多很大的成绩，尽管殖民主义者还在用各种阴谋诡计来破坏亚非人民的团结，但是在这个亚非人民和一切被压迫民族觉醒的新时代，要想扭转历史的车轮是不可能的。亚非人民已经取得了伟大的胜利，并且还将取得更伟大的胜利，这是任何力量都不能阻挡的。
    我们中国人民诚挚地希望同亚非各国进一步加强友好合作的关系，共同为贯彻亚非会议的决议，为争取亚非人民的幸福，为加强亚洲和世界的和平而继续奋斗。
    亚非各民族的独立、自由和友好团结万岁！
    世界和平和国际合作万岁！
