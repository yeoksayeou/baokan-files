Launching an Advanced Producer Movement

The Electrical Industry Department Summarizes Over One Hundred Advanced Experiences

The Electrical Industry Department has summarized 123 advanced experiences, which are prepared to be exchanged and promoted at the National Conference of Advanced Producers in the Electrical Industry.

Among these advanced experiences, 75 are related to capital construction. The parallel cross-operation method successfully tested at the Guanting Hydropower Station, and the segmented furnace wall construction and scaffold-free truss support method used on some construction sites in Northeast China, if promoted in all power generation projects across the country, could shorten the construction period of future power plants by 20% to 30% compared to the past. The Design Institute of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry recently designed and successfully tested segmented reinforced concrete utility poles. If these utility poles are used for all 110 kV and 154 kV high-voltage power lines constructed this year, the country can save 7,600 tons of steel.

Among these advanced experiences, many are related to ensuring safe power generation and supply, and reducing power generation costs. Units such as the steam turbine division of the Jixi Power Plant and the boiler division of the Datong Power Plant, which have maintained 1,000 to 2,000 days without accidents, are preparing to share their advanced experiences in safe operation at this conference. The advanced operating experience created by Hua Wanfu, a stoker at the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, has enabled the chain furnace he manages to achieve a thermal efficiency of 88%, which is about 18% higher than the thermal efficiency of ordinary thermal power plant chain furnaces.

Advanced Cotton Fabric Variety Group

The various cotton fabrics needed by the capital's summer market have been prepared by the variety group of the Beijing Municipal Company of China National Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Corporation. In the first quarter, this group has already transported more than 1,000 kinds of cotton fabrics with different patterns from other places to the people of the capital, including more than 850 new patterns. In the second quarter, they will add 600 kinds of new patterns of cotton fabric. This variety group has been elected as a representative to attend the National Conference of Advanced Producers.

In order to ensure that the inventory of goods meets consumers, this variety group held an inventory exhibition in the fourth quarter of last year to listen to consumers' opinions and requirements reflected by business personnel, and organized sources of goods based on these opinions. At the beginning of this year, they also carried samples of various patterns of cloth to factories, government agencies, schools, and suburban rural areas for exhibitions, soliciting opinions from consumers of different classes, and revising and supplementing the purchase plan accordingly.

Workers Who Are Good at Learning Advanced Experiences

Elected as Advanced Producers

Eighty-one highway workers have been elected as advanced producers for their outstanding achievements in learning and promoting the advanced experiences of others. They all attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers in Transportation held in Beijing.

Among these advanced producers, the most prominent are Gao Huchen, a driver from Tianjin, and Gou Xifu, a driver from Shandong Province. After Gao Huchen learned the experience of Bian Jieqiu, a national highway labor model, in lubricating the chassis of his car to save gasoline, the car he drove himself, like Bian Jieqiu's car, had its machinery and parts well lubricated. A large car weighing five or six tons could be pushed by one person. The advantage of doing this is that it can reduce the resistance of the car and save gasoline. Most drivers in Tianjin have learned Bian Jieqiu's maintenance methods based on Gao Huchen's experience, and thus can save an average of 5% to 10% of gasoline.

After Gou Xifu learned Bian Jieqiu's experience, he gave demonstration performances everywhere, promoting the benefits of Bian Jieqiu's experience. Liaocheng Station in Shandong was originally a well-known fuel-consuming station. Because of Gou Xifu's influence, 77% of the drivers learned Bian Jieqiu's experience, and the fuel-consuming Liaocheng Station has since become a fuel-saving station. (Xinhua News Agency)

专栏：开展先进生产者运动

    开展先进生产者运动
    电力工业部门总结出一百多项先进经验
    电力工业部门总结出来的123项先进经验，准备在全国电业先进生产者代表会议上交流推广。
    这些先进经验中，有七十五项是属于基本建设方面的。官厅水电站试用成功的平行交叉作业法，东北有些工地上采用的分段砌炉墙和无脚手桁架支模法等先进经验，如果在全国所有的发电工程中推广，可以使今后建设发电厂的施工日期比过去缩短20％到30％。电力工业部设计院最近设计并试验成功了分段钢筋混凝土电线杆。如果在今年施工的一百一十千伏和一百五十四千伏的高压电线都采用这种电线杆，全年可以为国家节省七千六百吨钢材。
    这些先进经验中，还有许多是属于保证安全发电、供电和降低发电成本方面的。保持一千天到两千天无事故的鸡西发电厂汽机分场和大同发电厂锅炉分场等单位，准备把他们的安全运行的先进经验，拿到这个会上交流。上海杨树浦发电厂司炉花万富创造的先进操作经验，使他所管理的链条炉热效率达到88％，比一般火力发电厂的链条炉热效率提高了18％左右。      （据新华社讯）
    先进的棉布品种组
    首都夏季市场所需要的各种棉布，中国花纱布公司北京市公司的品种组已经准备好了。这个组在第一季度已经为首都人民从外地运来了一千多种花型的棉布，其中新花型有850多种，第二季度还要增加六百种新花型的棉布。这个品种组已被推选为出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表。
    这个品种组，为了使库存的商品和消费者见面，去年第四季度他们就举办库存展览会，听取业务人员所反映的消费者的意见和要求，并根据意见，组织货源。今年年初，他们又携带各种花型的布样到工厂、机关、学校和郊区农村展览，征求不同阶层消费者的意见，从新修正和增加了进货计划。    （新华社）
    善于学习先进经验的工人
    当选为先进生产者
    有八十一个公路工人由于学习和推广别人的先进经验有出色成绩，当选为先进生产者。他们都出席了在北京召开的全国交通先进生产者代表会议。
    这批先进生产者中，最突出的是天津市汽车司机高虎臣和山东省汽车司机苟希福。高虎臣学习全国公路劳动模范卞介秋汽车底盘滑润节省汽油的经验以后，他自己驾驶的汽车也像卞介秋的车子一样，机器和零件都保养得十分润滑，五、六吨重的大汽车一个人就能推动。这样做的好处是可以减少汽车的阻力，节省汽油。天津市大多数汽车司机根据高虎臣的经验，也学会了卞介秋的保养办法，因而平均能节省5％到10％的汽油。
    苟希福学会了卞介秋的经验以后，到处作示范表演，宣传卞介秋经验的好处。山东聊城车站原来是有名的费油站，因为受了苟希福的影响，有77％的汽车司机学会了卞介秋的经验，费油的聊城车站从此变成省油站。     （新华社）
