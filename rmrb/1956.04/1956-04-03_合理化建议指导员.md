    Rationalization Proposal Instructor
    In each workshop of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, rationalization proposal instructors are assigned.
    The rationalization proposal instructors actively organize workers to put forward rationalization proposals. Tian Chunhuang, the rationalization proposal instructor in the lead electrolysis workshop, organized workers to put forward five major rationalization proposals based on the factory's task of improving the quality of electrolytic lead, enabling the quality of electrolytic lead to reach the special grade lead standard. Rationalization proposal instructors carefully handle the rationalization proposals put forward by workers. Those that the workshop cannot solve are promptly transferred to the factory's technical section; those that can be handled are formulated into plans by them, who personally take charge and organize and supervise others to implement them.
