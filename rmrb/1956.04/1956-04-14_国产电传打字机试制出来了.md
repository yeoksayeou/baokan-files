Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th. The first pair of Chinese-made teletypewriters has been successfully trial-manufactured in Shanghai.

The teletypewriter is a new type of telegraph machine. To send a telegram with it, the telegraph operator only needs to press the keys with Arabic letters on the transmitting machine according to the code translated from Chinese characters, and the receiving machine will automatically type the same code on paper. This telegraph machine also has English alphabet keys, so when sending English telegrams, the other party can directly receive the original text, and it can record four hundred letters per minute.

This first pair of teletypewriters was successfully trial-manufactured by the Shanghai Equipment Factory of the Materials Supply Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications last month. It is currently undergoing evaluation. After the evaluation, small-scale production will begin in the second half of this year.

    国产电传打字机试制出来了
    新华社上海13日电　中国制造的第一对电传打字机已经在上海试制出来。
    电传打字机是一种新型的电报机，用它打电报，发报员只要根据中文译成的字码，按捺发报机上的阿拉伯字母的字键，收报机就会自动将同样的字码打在纸上。这种电报机还设有英文字母的字键，在打英文电报的时候，对方可以直接收到原文，每分钟可以收录四百个字母。
    这第一对电传打字机，是邮电部器材供应管理局上海器材厂在上个月试制成功的。最近正在进行鉴定。鉴定以后，将在今年下半年开始小批生产。
