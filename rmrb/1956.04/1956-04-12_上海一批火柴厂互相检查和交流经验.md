A batch of twelve newly established joint state-private match factories in Shanghai recently organized a "factory mutual inspection" in the process of socialist competition, solving some of the main problems existing in the production of each factory.

The "factory mutual inspection" work was attended by the labor union chairmen, technicians, and private representatives of these factories. Under the leadership of relevant departments, they conducted mutual inspections of the production situation of each factory and exchanged experiences at the same time. When technicians and private representatives from the joint state-private Rongchang Match Factory inspected the Dazhong Match Factory, they found that the factory had a relatively high number of double-headed matchsticks, which affected the boxing process. They actively helped with research and worked together to overcome this shortcoming. When the labor union cadres and technicians from the Daming Match Factory inspected the Zhengfeng Match Factory, they found that the match heads in this factory were smooth, while the problem of medicine head traces in their own factory had not been resolved. They humbly learned from them, and now this problem has been basically solved.

    上海一批火柴厂互相检查和交流经验
    上海市十二家新公私合营的火柴厂，最近在社会主义竞赛过程中，组织了一次“厂际互检”，解决了各厂生产中存在的一些主要问题。
    “厂际互检”工作由这些工厂的工会主席、技术人员和私方人员参加。他们在有关部门的领导下对各厂生产情况进行了相互检查，同时交流了经验。公私合营荣昌火柴厂技术人员和私方人员在大中火柴厂检查的时候，发现这个厂双头梗比较多，影响装盒，就积极帮助研究，共同克服这个缺点。大明火柴厂工会干部和技术人员在正丰火柴厂检查的时候，发现这个厂火柴头光滑，而自己厂里有药头痕路问题没有解决，就虚心向他们学习，现在这个问题已经基本上解决了。
