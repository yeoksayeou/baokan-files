Good Ways to Unleash the Potential of State Farms in Land Reclamation
    Ding Luxu

This year, state farms in Heilongjiang Province have decided to reclaim 139,000 hectares of wasteland. This figure is equivalent to the total amount of wasteland reclaimed by state farms in Heilongjiang Province in the past eight years, exceeding the original five-year land reclamation plan by 60,000 hectares. If such a huge task had been proposed more than half a year ago, it would have been unimaginable. However, after more than half a year of opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, especially encouraged by the great victory of the agricultural cooperative movement, completing such a huge task has not only become possible but has also been firmly guaranteed.

The first method for large-scale land reclamation is to establish new state farms. This year, Heilongjiang Province has decided to build six new large-scale grain farms, which require considerable construction funds and manpower, material resources, and a series of equipment for repair, supply, and transportation. However, there is a shortage of cadres and technical workers, and the technical level is low, making it difficult to complete this task. After studying this situation, the Provincial State Farm Administration Bureau, based on the instructions of the Party and higher authorities, decided to fully utilize the existing foundation and adopt the method of "expanding farms by using existing farms" to complete the construction task.

The method of "expanding farms by using existing farms" involves designating old farms to take responsibility for building new farms. This method is suitable for old farms with a good foundation and large areas of wasteland nearby. The designated old farm is fully responsible for the assignment of personnel and specific operational issues during the construction of the new farm. This year, Heilongjiang has established three new farms in this way. The Jiusan Farm alone has established two new farms nearby. One is the Red May Farm established in Nanyanggang, Nehe County, with more than 20,000 hectares of reclaimable land. The other is the Da Xijiang Farm, expanded from the first work area of the Jiusan Farm, with a cultivated area of over 10,000 hectares.

Another method of "expanding farms by using existing farms" is to expand the smaller county-run farms (with large areas of reclaimable wasteland nearby) into large-scale farms and designate nearby old farms with a foundation to be responsible for the construction work. Except for the necessary assistance from the leading organs, most of the specific issues during the construction of the new farm are handled by the designated old farm. Three new farms have been established in this way. Among them, the Jinsha Farm, established by the Yong'an Farm and the Shuguang Farm, has a cultivable area of up to 40,000 hectares.

Adopting these construction methods not only fully utilizes existing forces but also saves construction funds and speeds up the construction process. Now, the six newly built large-scale grain farms have basically been staffed, production materials have been prepared, and the preparatory work for land reclamation has been fully completed.

The benefits of "expanding farms by using existing farms" are: 1. Under the principle of taking care of the production and development of old farms while ensuring the smooth progress of new farm construction, overall personnel allocation is achieved, the potential of cadres and technical workers of old farms is brought into play, and the problem of insufficient personnel in new farms is solved. For example, the Jiusan Farm is responsible for staffing the Red May Farm and Da Xijiang Farm, and the Tongbei Farm is responsible for staffing the Heping Farm. Each farm has adopted a quick method to train the required technical workers. Each farm conducted winter training last winter, selecting trainees from agricultural workers and having experienced drivers and farm tool operators act as instructors, training a total of 1,670 tractor operators and farm tool operators, meeting the needs of construction. 2. It ensures the supply of materials. The new farm's needs for fuel, feed, seeds, etc., are quickly prepared through internal adjustment and allocation from nearby old farms. 3. It reduces basic construction investment. A large part of the basic construction of the main transportation equipment, repair shops, warehouses, etc., utilizes the original equipment of the old farms, saving a lot of funds. The new farms only need to prepare working capital, equip themselves with the necessary machinery, and carry out some urgently needed basic construction before they can start reclaiming land and sowing seeds. This year, the six newly built farms will reclaim more than 30,000 hectares in the first year, sow more than 18,000 hectares, and plan to produce more than 11,000 tons of grain.

Facts have proven that adopting the method of "expanding farms by using existing farms" to establish new state farms is a good way to achieve "less investment and quick results." The Heilongjiang Provincial State Farm Administration Bureau has clearly stipulated in its overall plan for the development of state farms that the future development of state farms should primarily focus on "expanding farms by using existing farms." This will gradually develop state farm clusters in certain areas, establish grassroots management agencies according to regions, and facilitate leadership.

The second method of large-scale land reclamation is to make every effort to unleash the potential of machinery and expand the cultivated area in existing farms. In the past, the agricultural machinery of state farms was underutilized during the farming season, and most of it was idle during the farming gaps, operating only for more than 100 days each year, with great potential. At the same time, these farms had large amounts of arable wasteland that was not rationally utilized. After studying this situation, the Provincial State Farm Administration Bureau decided that the original farms should make full use of existing machinery and equipment, especially seize the farming gaps, make every effort to unleash the potential of the machinery, and reclaim all usable land in the farm area. This year, all twenty-four grain farms and some livestock farms in the province have decided to make all tractors operate year-round (except in winter). Farms with reclaimable wasteland, in addition to extracting the machinery that can be extracted for land reclamation during the farming season, will put all tractors into land reclamation during all farming gaps. Farms without reclaimable wasteland will transfer their machinery to nearby farms for land reclamation during the farming gaps. After adopting these measures, according to preliminary calculations, each standard (15 horsepower) tractor can cultivate 450 hectares throughout the year, an increase of more than 30% compared to the past. This year, there are more than 1,600 standard tractors in various farms, and simply improving efficiency can cultivate an additional 240,000 hectares, equivalent to the total workload of reclaiming 80,000 hectares of wasteland (including plowing and harrowing). Due to the release of potential, the existing farms this year only need to increase the necessary working capital and some machinery to reclaim 100,800 hectares of wasteland while completing the planting task of 130,000 hectares of crops. The state has decided to reduce the number of Stalin 80 tractors by 22 and medium-sized tractors by 52 in the agricultural machinery allocated to Heilongjiang Province this year. Because of the potential that has been unleashed, all farms are full of confidence and unanimously pledged to ensure that reducing machines will not reduce tasks.

    发挥国营农场垦荒潜力的好办法
    丁履枢
    黑龙江省的国营农场，今年决定开垦荒地十三万九千公顷。这个数字相当于黑龙江省国营农场过去八年来开垦荒地的总数，超过原定五年开荒计划六万公顷。这样巨大的任务，如果是在半年以前提出来，是人们不敢想像的事情。可是经过半年多以来的反对右倾保守思想之后，特别是在农业合作化运动取得巨大胜利的鼓舞下，完成这样巨大的任务，不仅成为可能，而且得到了确切的保证。
    大面积开垦荒地的第一个方法，是建立新的国营农场。黑龙江省今年决定新建大型谷物农场六处，这需要相当大的建场资金和人力、物力，需要修理、供应、交通运输等一系列的设备。但是目前干部和技术工人不足，技术水平又低，完成这一任务有很多困难。省国营农场管理厅研究了这种情况，根据党和上级的指示，确定充分利用现有基础，采取“以场扩场”的方法来完成建场任务。
    “以场扩场”的方法，一种是指定旧场包建新场的方法。这种方法适用于附近有大片荒地、基础又好的老场。建场中有关人员的配备以及业务方面的具体问题，由被指定的这个老场负全部责任。黑龙江今年这样建立的新场共三处。九三农场一个场就在附近建立了两个新场。一个是在讷河县南洋岗建立的红五月农场，可垦地在二万公顷以上；另一个是在九三农场第一作业区的基础上扩建成的大西江农场，耕地面积达万多公顷。
    “以场扩场”的另一种方法，是把规模较小的县营农场（附近有大片可垦荒地），扩建成大型农场，并且指定附近有基础的老场负责建场工作。建场中的具体问题，除必要的由领导机关负责解决外，大部分由被指定的老场负责。这样建立的新场共三处。其中由永安农场和曙光农场负责建立的金沙农场，耕地面积可达四万公顷。
    采取这些建场方法，既充分地发挥了现有力量，又节省了建场资金，加快了建场速度。现在新建的六处大型谷物农场，人员已经基本上配足；生产资料已经备齐，开垦荒地的准备工作已经全部完成。
    “以场扩场”的好处是：一、在既照顾老场的生产发展，又保证建场工作顺利进行的原则下，做到人员统筹调配，发挥了老场干部和技术工人的潜在力，解决了新场人员不足的问题。例如红五月、大西江两场的人员都由九三农场负责配足，和平农场的人员由通北农场配备。各场都采取快速方法，训练培养所需的技术工人。各场都在去年冬天进行了冬训工作，从农工中选拔学员，由老驾驶员、老农具手担任教员，共训练出拖拉机手和农具手1，670人，满足了建场的需要。二、保证了物资供应。新场所需油料、饲料、种子等都由附近老场内部调剂调拨，很快都备齐了。三、减少了基本建设投资。主要的交通运输设备、修理厂、仓库等很大一部分基本建设都利用了老场原有设备，节省了大量资金。新场只需准备流动资金，配备必要的机具，进行一部分迫切需要的基本建设，就可以开荒播种。今年新建的六处新场，第一年就开荒三万多公顷，播种一万八千多公顷，计划生产粮食一万一千多吨。
    事实证明，采取“以场扩场”的方法建立新的国营农场，是“投资少收效快”的好办法。黑龙江省国营农场管理厅在发展国营农场的全面规划里，已经明确规定今后发展国营农场就以“以场扩场”为主要方法，这样可以逐渐在某些地区发展起国营农场群，按地区设立基层管理机构，更便于进行领导。
    大面积开荒的第二个方法，就是在旧有农场里尽力发挥机械潜力，扩大耕地面积。国营农场的农业机械，过去在农作季节里利用不足，农作间隙里大部分闲置不用，每年只作业一百多天，潜力很大。而这些场场内又有大量的可耕荒地，没有合理利用。省国营农场管理厅研究了这种情况，决定原有农场要充分利用现有机械设备，特别是抓住农作间隙，尽力发挥机械潜力，把场区内可能利用的土地，全都开垦起来。全省二十四个谷物农场和部分畜牧场，今年决定把全部拖拉机都做到常年作业（冬季除外）。有可垦荒地的农场，除在农作季节内抽出可能抽调的机车进行开荒以外，所有农作间隙，把全部拖拉机都投入开荒。没有可垦荒地的农场，在农作间隙里把机车调到附近场开荒。采取这些办法后，据初步计算，每标准台（十五马力）拖拉机全年可耕作四百五十公顷，比过去提高30％多。今年各场共有拖拉机一千六百多标准台，仅提高效率一项，即可多耕作二十四万公顷，相当于开垦八万公顷荒地的全部工作量（包括耕地、耙地）。由于发挥了潜力，今年旧有农场只增加必要的流动资金和一部分机具，就可以在完成十三万公顷农作物种植任务的同时，开垦荒地十万零八千公顷。国家确定在今年拨给黑龙江省的农业机械中，减少斯大林八十号拖拉机二十二台，中型拖拉机五十二台。因为发挥了本身的潜力，各场都充满信心地一致提出保证：减少机器，不减任务。
