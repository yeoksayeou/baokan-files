Several thousand construction and installation workers from Anshan arrived at the construction site of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex on the 23rd and began building a large construction base. This base includes more than 20 large-scale enterprises, including a relatively large joint processing plant for building materials, an electrical installation and processing plant, a cement pipe processing plant, a construction machinery repair plant, and an automobile base. This base will be responsible for the production of the main building materials during the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex. Welfare areas and workers' new villages around the plant area are also under intensive construction.

According to the plan, most of the construction preparation work for the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex will be completed this year. The Baotou Branch of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, which is responsible for all construction tasks this year, has established two engineering companies and five specialized engineering teams in Baotou. A mechanized supply station responsible for supplying construction machinery has also been established. More than 6,000 employees are already working at the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex construction site.

    包钢年内完成建设准备
    二十三日，从鞍山来的几千名建筑安装工人，进入包头钢铁联合企业工地，开始建设一个巨大的建筑基地。这个基地包括二十多项大型企业。其中有规模相当大的建筑材料联合加工厂、电气安装加工厂、水泥管道加工厂、施工机械修理厂和汽车基地等。这个基地将担负起包头钢铁联合企业建设过程中主要建筑材料的生产任务。在厂区周围的福利区和工人新村也正在加紧建设。
    按照计划，包头钢铁联合企业的施工准备的大部分工作，将在今年内完成。担负今年全部建筑任务的鞍山钢铁建设公司包头分公司，已经在包头成立了两个工程公司和五个专业工程队。负责供应施工机械的机械化供应站也成立了。在包头钢铁联合企业工地上工作的职工已经达六千多人。
