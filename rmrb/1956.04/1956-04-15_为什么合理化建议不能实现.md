    Why Rationalization Proposals Cannot Be Implemented
    Harbin Electric Wire Factory Turner Liu Zhenzhong

    The length of the electric wire produced by our Harbin Electric Wire Factory is always calculated inaccurately. When the wire is being wound onto the spool from the machine, the person watching the machine shouts "One hundred meters!" and then the person winding the wire marks a sign for one hundred meters. However, the wire moves very quickly, and the length can vary greatly depending on how quickly the person winding the wire moves. Therefore, our sales department is often criticized and blamed by the purchasing department for incorrect wire lengths.

    In light of this situation, I proposed installing an automatic length calculation device at the winding location, called a "meter counter." Every time it reaches one hundred meters, a bell rings, and at the same time, two brushes, one above and one below, brush a mark of a different color on the outer skin of the wire, which would accurately calculate the length. After a long period of research, I drew a rough sketch of this "meter counter" and submitted it to the factory as a rationalization proposal. This happened on June 14, 1954.

    When this proposal reached the factory director, he immediately wrote "To be solved independently by the Fifth Workshop" on it. When the instruction reached our workshop, the workshop did nothing. At that time, the rationalization proposal committee organized a research group and held three meetings in a row, but there were no results. I really wanted to get help from the technical staff, but the technicians were not satisfied with the proposal, blaming me for not providing theoretical basis.

    At this time, I was a little discouraged because of my low level of education, but the comrades of the rationalization proposal committee kept encouraging me and told me to draw detailed drawings. Right, I must not bow my head to difficulties! I spent several nights drawing the detailed drawings, and the factory's technical department also agreed to trial-produce it. But as soon as it got to the workshop, I encountered obstacles. The workshop leader emphasized that the production task was urgent and would not give time for trial production. They thought: "If the production task is not completed, the factory director will be criticized, and if this matter is not handled well, we cannot bear the criticism." In fact, researching this "meter counter" well could better complete the task. It was delayed until the end of 1954, and this problem was still not resolved.

    Later, I found scrap materials myself, squeezed out time, and tried to produce it myself. After a few months, most of the parts were manufactured. I am a turner, and there were a few fitter jobs that I could not do, and the rationalization proposal committee helped me solve this problem. At this time, I thought to myself, the "meter counter" could finally be trial-produced successfully. Who knew that the last hurdle could not be overcome: lacking a copper wire coil, I could no longer find anyone to support this proposal. The coil is a very important part and must be made by order of the factory. But this problem has not been resolved until now, and no one has been concerned about it for a long time.

    Is this coil difficult to make? Not at all, as long as the factory supports it, it can be solved quickly. From 1954 to 1955, our factory continuously solved many key problems in the copper smelting and rolling workshop. The only reason was that the factory attached importance to it and organized technical forces to carry out these tasks. Regarding the "meter counter" proposal, the factory leadership did not pay attention to it. This is not right. As long as the suggestions of the workers are helpful to production, the leadership should pay attention to them.

    In our factory, it is not only the proposal for the "meter counter" that has not been implemented. The proposal for the trial production of a "yarn wrapping and tamping machine" put forward by worker Zhang Decong has also been delayed until now without results. In the increasingly developing advanced producer movement, we should tap potential forces from all aspects to accelerate the speed of socialist construction. I hope that the factory will support my proposal and help me overcome difficulties so that the "meter counter" can be trial-produced as soon as possible.

    为什么合理化建议不能实现
    哈尔滨电线厂车工　刘振忠
    我们哈尔滨电线厂生产的电线，长度总是计算不准确。电线从机器上往线轴上缠的时候，看机器的人喊一声“一百公尺！”缠线的人才记上一百公尺的记号。但是线走的很快，缠线的人动手快慢，长短就会有很大悬殊。因此，我们的销售科经常因为电线长度不对而受到购货部门的批评和指责。
    根据这种情况，我提议在缠线的地方安装一个自动的计算长度的装置，叫作“计算公尺器”。每到一百公尺的时候，响一下铃，同时上下两个刷子就在电线外皮上刷上一道不同颜色的记号，这样就会把长度计算得很准确。我经过很长时间的研究，画出了这个“计算公尺器”的草图，作为合理化建议交给厂部。这是1954年6月14日的事情。
    这个建议到了厂长手里，厂长马上就批了“由五车间自行解决”几个大字。批示拿到我们车间，车间没管。当时合理化建议委员会组织了研究小组，一连开了三次会，但是没有结果。我很想得到技术人员的帮助，可是技术员不满意这个建议，怪我没有提出理论根据来。
    这个时候，我因为文化程度低，有点灰心，但是合理化建议委员会的同志一直鼓励我，叫我画详图。对，不能向困难低头！我花费了几个晚上，把详图画出来了，厂里的技术部门也同意试制。但是一到车间就碰到阻碍了，车间负责人强调生产任务紧急，不给试制时间。他们认为：生产任务完不成厂长要受批评，这件事搞不好受不了批评。”其实，把这个“计算公尺器”研究好了，正可以更好地完成任务。就这样一直拖到1954年年底，这个问题还没有得到解决。
    后来，我就自己找废料，挤时间，自己试制。过了几个月，大部分零件都制造出来了。我是车工，有几件钳工活不能作，又是合理化建议委员会帮助我解决了这个问题。这时候我心里想，“计算公尺器”总可以试制成功了。谁知道最后一关却没有过去：缺少一个铜线缠的线圈，就再也找不到能支持这个建议的人了。线圈是很重要的零件，一定要厂部下命令才能作。但是一直拖到现在这个问题还没有解决，而且已经有好长时期没有人过问这件事情了。
    这种线圈很难作吗？决不是，只要厂部支持，很快就可以解决。我们厂子从1954年到1955年，就连续解决了融铜压延车间的好多关键问题，唯一的原因就是厂部重视，把技术力量组织起来进行这些工作。关于“计算公尺器”的建议，工厂领导方面却没有加以重视。这是不对的。职工的建议只要对生产有帮助，领导方面就应当重视。
    在我们厂里，也不仅仅是关于“计算公尺器”的建议没有实现，张德聪工友提的试制“包纱、捣线机”的建议，也是一直拖到现在没有结果。在日益发展的先进生产者运动中，应当从各方面挖掘潜在力量，以加快社会主义建设的速度。希望厂部支持我这个建议，帮助我克服困难，使“计算公尺器”赶快试制出来。
