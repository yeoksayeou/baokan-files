In the autumn harvest season last year, the number of farm households in Xinjiang participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounted for only 5.3% of the total number of farm households. However, only half a year after Chairman Mao's report on the issue of agricultural cooperation, the rural areas have basically been cooperativized.

Since liberation, agricultural production in Xinjiang has significantly improved. From 1950 to 1955, the cultivated land area was expanded by 5.62 million mu, an increase of 33% compared to before liberation. From 1950 to 1955, the yield per mu of grain increased by 49%, and the yield per mu of cotton increased by 125%. Hami and Yanqi have not only changed their grain-deficient situation but also have abundant surplus grain. The Manas River Basin, which people used to think was unsuitable for cotton planting, saw the farms of the production corps create a nationally renowned high-yield record on 82,000 mu of cotton fields in 1955.

The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are not complacent about the achievements they have made. They want to strive for a better tomorrow. When discussing the National Agricultural Development Program, they want to increase the total grain output of Xinjiang from 3,825.39 million jin in 1955 to 20,570 million jin in 1967. In this way, in addition to selling to the state and for farmers' own use, farmers' average grain storage can last for two years. They also want to increase the yield of cotton from 47 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1955 to 120 jin in 1967. By 1967, the total cotton output will reach 1.68 billion jin, which will be thirty times the total cotton output of 54.2 million jin in 1955.

North and south of the Tianshan Mountains, the land is flat and suitable for mechanized farming. Southern Xinjiang has a warm climate with a frost-free period of more than 180 days, and northern Xinjiang also has a frost-free period of 120-150 days. Although rainfall is scarce in Xinjiang, the Ili River Valley does not lack rain; the endless water flowing from the year-round snow-capped Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains can be fully used for artificial control to irrigate fields. These favorable conditions make the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains rich in agricultural crops such as cotton, wheat, corn, and rice. The Hami and Shanshan melons, Turpan grapes, and Korla fragrant pears have long been household names. In particular, the Turpan Basin, with a frost-free period of about 220 days, is suitable for the growth of long-staple cotton.

Since the liberation of Xinjiang, various places have successively created many high-yield records. For example, in 1955, the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Turpan County produced 256 jin of ginned cotton per mu on 40 mu of cotton fields. In 1953, the 3.4 mu of winter wheat grown by Ku Wanse Lai, a farmer in Xinhe County, reached a yield of 1,510 jin per mu. In 1954, the 226 mu of rice in a farm of a certain unit in Wujiaqu reached a yield of 1,278 jin per mu. These facts fully demonstrate that the potential for increasing agricultural production in Xinjiang is very great.

Improving farming techniques is of extreme importance for increasing agricultural production in Xinjiang. According to a survey in the Ili region, simply changing from broadcast sowing to row sowing can increase production by 15%-30%. In 1955, the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Turpan County changed from flood irrigation to frequent and shallow irrigation and shortened the rotation irrigation period, and the cotton yield increased by 48% compared to 1954.

Xinjiang has abundant fertilizer sources, but farmers in many areas do not have the habit of accumulating fertilizer. Since last winter, from Hami in the east to Kashgar and Ili in the west, the vast number of farmers have launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. In the future, Xinjiang's pastoral areas will gradually implement settled nomadism and settled grazing, and universally build enclosures and sheds, which can also accumulate more fertilizer. By 1967, the entire region can strive to accumulate 218 billion jin of farmyard manure. This can achieve the application of 3,000 jin to 4,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. The utilization rate of labor in Xinjiang is very low. Male laborers work an average of only about 150 days per year, and women participate in labor for only about 50 days. Gradually increasing the utilization rate of labor is one of the important conditions for increasing agricultural production in Xinjiang in the future.

Xinjiang has more than 160 million mu of wasteland, of which 110 million mu are arable land. The entire region will strive to reclaim 60 million mu of wasteland within twelve years. The general survey of rivers in the entire region will be completed this year. In the near future, more farms will appear in the Ili River Valley, Turpan, Junggar, and Tarim Basins. Many reservoirs will be built in the Tianshan Mountains. In order to prevent wind and sand, more field protection forests will be built north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Within twelve years, from Usu to Mulei River, from Kashgar to Minfeng, and from Toksun to Shanshan, a protective forest belt more than 1,600 kilometers long will be built.

Xinjiang has China's famous pastures, with a grassland area of about 300,000 square kilometers. Animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion of the national economy. The four ethnic groups of Kazakh, Mongolian, Kirgiz, and Tajik rely entirely on animal husbandry to maintain their livelihoods. From 1949, when Xinjiang was liberated, to 1955, the total number of livestock increased by 56% compared to before liberation. In the future, Xinjiang will greatly develop animal husbandry and increase the number of livestock. In terms of improving pastures and grasslands alone, the entire region will reach 20 million mu within twelve years. In the future, Xinjiang will have more livestock and animal products to support the socialist construction of the motherland.

With the gradual development of agricultural production and animal husbandry, the hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will use their own hands to build the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains into a more prosperous and beautiful place.

    把天山南北建设得更富饶美丽
    本报记者  沈石
    去年秋收季节，新疆加入农业生产合作社的农户仅占总农户的5.3％，但是在毛主席的关于农业合作化问题的报告以后，仅仅过去半年，农村已经基本合作化了。
    解放后，新疆的农业生产有了显著的提高。从1950年到1955年，扩大了耕地面积562万亩，比解放前增加了33％，从1950年到1955年，粮食每亩产量提高了49％，棉花每亩产量提高了125％。哈密、焉耆不但改变了缺粮的情况，还有充裕的余粮。从前人们认为不能植棉的玛纳斯河流域，1955年生产部队的农场在八万二千亩棉田上创造了名闻全国的高额丰产纪录。
    新疆各族人民对已经取得的成就并不自满，他们还要争取更美好的明天。在讨论全国农业生产发展纲要的时候，他们要使全疆粮食的总产量从1955年的382，539万斤提高到1967年的2，057，000万斤。这样，除了卖给国家和农民自用外，农民平均储存的粮食可供二年之用。他们还要使棉花从1955年的每亩产皮棉47斤提高到1967年的120斤。到了1967年，棉花的总产量将达到十六亿八千万斤，这将为1955年棉花总产量5，420万斤的三十倍。
    天山南北，土地平坦，适于机械耕作。南疆气候温暖，无霜期在180天以上，北疆无霜期也有120—150天。新疆虽然雨量稀少，但是伊犁河谷并不缺雨；终年积雪的天山、昆仑山流下来的源源不断的水，完全可以用人工控制来灌溉田亩。这些良好的条件，使天山南北盛产着棉花、小麦、玉米、水稻等农作物。而哈密、鄯善的甜瓜、吐鲁番的葡萄、库尔勒的香梨早就脍炙人口了。特别是吐鲁番盆地，无霜期长达220天左右，适宜于长绒棉的生长。
    新疆解放以来，各地曾先后创造了许多高额丰产的纪录。像1955年吐鲁番县五星农业生产合作社的四十亩棉田，每亩产皮棉256斤。1953年新和县农民库完色来的3.4亩冬小麦，每亩产量达到1，510斤。1954年，五家渠某部农场的226亩水稻，每亩产量达到1，278斤。这些事实充分说明，新疆农业增产的潜力是很大的。
    改进耕作技术，对新疆农业增产有极重要的意义。据伊犁地区调查，仅仅把撒播改为条播，就可以增产15％—30％。1955年，吐鲁县红旗农业生产合作社，把漫灌改为勤浇浅灌，缩短轮灌期限，棉花的产量比1954年增加了48％。
    新疆肥源充足，但是，许多地区农民没有积肥的习惯。去冬以来，东起哈密，西到喀什、伊犁，广大农民掀起了积肥运动。新疆的牧区，今后将逐步实行定居游牧和定牧，普遍修盖圈棚，这样也可蓄积更多的肥料。到1967年，全区可争取积2，180亿斤厩肥。这样就可达到每亩施肥三千斤到四千斤。新疆劳动力的利用率很低，男劳动力平均每年工作日只有一百五十天左右，妇女参加劳动的一般仅五十天左右。逐年增加劳动力的利用率，是新疆今后农业增产的重要条件之一。
    新疆有一亿六千万亩以上的荒地，其中可耕地达一亿一千万亩。全疆争取在十二年内，开垦荒地六千万亩。全疆的河流普查工作，将在今年内完成。不久的将来，伊犁河谷、吐鲁番、准噶尔和塔里木盆地，将出现更多的农场。天山丛中，将兴修许多水库。为了防止风沙，天山南北将营造更多的护田林，十二年内，从乌苏到木垒河，从喀什到民丰，从托克逊到鄯善，将营造全长一千六百多公里的防护林带。
    新疆有我国驰名的牧场，草场面积约三十万平方公里。畜牧业在国民经济中占很大的比重。哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜和塔吉克四个民族完全靠畜牧业维持生活。从新疆解放的1949年到1955年，牲畜总头数较解放前增加了56％。今后，新疆将大量发展畜牧业，增加牲畜的头数。仅就改良牧场和草场来说，全疆将在十二年内达到两千万亩。今后，新疆将有更多的牲畜和畜产品来支援祖国的社会主义建设。
    随着农业生产和畜牧业的逐年发展，勤劳勇敢的新疆各族人民，将用自己的手，把天山南北建设得更加富饶美丽。
