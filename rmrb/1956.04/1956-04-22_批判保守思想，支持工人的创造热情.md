    Criticize Conservative Thinking, Support Workers' Creative Enthusiasm
    Enterprise management should catch up quickly
    Editor:
    From December 20th of last year to March 23rd of this year, workers at the Shenyang Transformer Factory proposed a total of 2,423 rationalization suggestions. Among them, Liu Ruisen of the metalworking workshop created a single-blade six-edge operation experience, which increased the production efficiency of "cap" parts by ten times compared to before; Chi Decheng's proposed water tank welding method eliminated the need for straightening the switch box after welding, while the product quality fully met the standards. In short, the implementation of these suggestions will have a significant impact on improving production.
    However, under this situation, the factory's enterprise management work has not kept up quickly. The staff of the factory's Rationalization Proposal Office often sit in the office, busy with registration and approval work, and the rationalization proposals accumulated from the end of last year to March 23rd of this year amounted to 1,753, accounting for 72.3% of the total number of proposals submitted. The factory's工艺 (gong yi - technology) department has also failed to strengthen cooperation with the Rationalization Proposal Office, and many effective suggestions and advanced experiences have not been able to be revised into the工艺 (gong yi - technology) regulations in a timely manner. In terms of promoting advanced experience, although the administration and the trade union have organized some technical performance meetings and achieved certain results, the overall situation is still not satisfactory. For example, the factory plans to promote 24 experiences in 1956, of which 12 are neither specific nor in line with the actual situation. The seventh item in the plan stipulates that high-speed cutting should be promoted on the four muffle furnace lathes in the metalworking workshop. In fact, eight of the nine muffle furnace lathes in the entire workshop are currently using high-speed cutting on different parts. Furthermore, advanced experiences such as rapid assembly, rapid winding, and multi-strip welding mostly appeared in February of this year, but they have not been systematically summarized and promoted in a planned way, so that only a few workers can use these experiences.
    This year, the Shenyang Transformer Factory has a large production task and complex technology. At present, the quality of some products is not good, and the phenomenon of imbalance in production is very serious. This requires the factory leaders to do a good job in rationalization proposals and adopt various specific measures to promote advanced experience, so as to rely on the enthusiasm of the workers to improve production.
                                                                                                Xiao Feng
    Unacceptable Indifference
    Editor:
    In the advanced producer movement carried out by the staff and workers in the local state-owned factories of Tangshan city, many rationalization proposals were put forward and the advanced experiences were actively studied and popularized. The leading persons in most of the factories took an encouraging and supporting attitude towards this enthusiasm of the worker masses. For example, the leading person of the joint state-private Xiangrui magnetizing factory introduced the "one-time molding of the pipe with a mouth" experience to the pipe-making workers and organized them to study it. After the promotion of this advanced experience, there were not enough pipe holders. The leading persons solved the problem in time and helped the workers to adjust the labor organization and carry out specialized division of labor. As a result, the output of pipes quickly increased from an average of nine pipes per person per day to seventeen and a half pipes per person per day.
    However, there were also some factory leaders who took a cold attitude towards the enthusiasm of the workers. For example, the joint state-private Dongya Refractory Material Factory formulated a production plan in February this year. After the workers discussed it, they all said that they could guarantee the completion of the task. The leading person in this factory thought that there was no problem with production, so they simply ignored the workers' request to learn advanced experiences. Some workers found that the raw material soil was sometimes soft and sometimes hard, and suggested that the leading person solve this problem. The workshop director criticized the workers for "emphasizing objective difficulties" instead. As a result, the quality of products in this factory continued to decline, and the production tasks were not completed. For another example, the leading person of the local state-owned Tangshan Paper Mill put forward the request to improve the beating degree of paper in March. The technicians in the factory suggested using the production method of "high concentration pulping and low concentration papermaking", but the leading person did not adopt this opinion and insisted on low concentration pulping. As a result, the beating degree of the paper was not up to standard.
    The indifferent attitude of the leading persons in these factories towards the workers' enthusiasm has already affected production. They should immediately recognize and correct their mistakes.
                                                                                                Shi Nan
    No Regular Cultivation, Only Temporary Grasping
    Editor:
    In June of last year, the leaders of the Wuxi Shenxin Textile Factory, according to the instructions of the higher authorities, specially organized a group to go to various units to summarize experiences. They held many meetings to understand the production, learning, and other advanced deeds of advanced figures, and wrote materials on six advanced figures. After reading these materials, the secretary of the factory's Party committee believed: "These materials have no blood, no flesh, and are not very educational to the masses, and should be re-summarized." Therefore, the factory's secretary, night school teachers, trade union cadres, and others, according to the requirements of the Party committee secretary, re-collected materials from various units. However, after the materials were collected, the Party committee secretary put them in the drawer and never mentioned this matter again.
    This matter happened at the Wuxi Shenxin Textile Factory is not accidental. The leading people in this factory do not pay attention to promoting advanced experience and cultivating advanced producers in ordinary times, but only temporarily grasp it when the superior authorities put forward requirements, and then put it aside after the matter is over. Therefore, some of the advanced figures and advanced units in the factory cannot often play a role, and the advanced experiences created by the workers cannot be promoted. For example, the Tang Jin Party group was originally the first advanced group in the whole factory, but because the leadership did not pay attention to their help and cultivation, there is no news of them now. For another example, the worker Zhang Ruyou created the advanced experience of no oil leakage from the billet of the cutter, but the leadership not only did not promote it, but said that "Zhang Ruyou has fame and gain thoughts."
    The workers of the Wuxi Shenxin Textile Factory have a lot of opinions about the attitude of the factory's leading personnel in not paying attention to advanced experience and advanced producers. They hope that they will check and correct this erroneous attitude through this advanced producer movement, and in future production, they will often pay attention to cultivating advanced producers and promoting advanced experience.
                                                                                                Lu Hongxi

### 批判保守思想，支持工人的创造热情

    批判保守思想，支持工人的创造热情
    企业管理工作应该很快赶上去编辑同志：
    沈阳变压器厂的工人们，从去年十二月二十日到今年三月二十三日一共提出了2，423件合理化建议。其中金工车间柳瑞森创造的单刀六刃操作经验，使生产“管帽”部件的效率比以前提高了十倍；迟德成提出的水槽焊接法，使开关箱在焊接以后，不必再经过矫正工序，而产品质量完全合乎标准。总之，实现这些建议，对于提高生产将会起巨大的作用。
    但是，在这种形势下，工厂的企业管理工作却没有很快地赶上去。厂合理化建议办公室工作人员经常坐在办公室，忙于登记、审批工作，而去年年底到今年三月二十三日积压的合理化建议就有1，753件，占已经提出的建议总数的72.3％。工厂工艺部门也没有和合理化建议办公室加强合作，不少行之有效的建议和先进经验都没有能及时修订到工艺规程中去。在推广先进经验的工作方面，虽然行政和工会曾经组织了一些技术表演会，并且得到了一定的效果，但是总的情况还是不能令人满意的。例如厂里计划在1956年要推广二十四项经验，其中有十二项规定得既不具体、又不符合实际情况，计划中的第七项规定目前要在金工车间的四台闷罐车床上推广快速切削，实际上现在全车间九台闷罐车床中已经有八台在不同部件上分别运用了高速切削。又如快速装配、快速卷线、多条焊接等先进经验大部分是今年二月份出现的，但是到现在还没有系统地总结和有计划地推广，以致这些经验只有少数工人能够运用。
    今年沈阳变压器厂生产任务很大，技术复杂，目前部分产品质量不好，生产中不平衡现象很严重，这就要求工厂领导方面做好合理化建议的工作，采用各种具体措施来推广先进经验，以便依靠工人群众的积极性，来搞好生产。        晓  风
    要不得的冷淡态度编辑同志：
    唐山市各地方国营工厂的职工们在开展先进生产者运动中，提出了很多合理化建议，并且积极学习和推广先进经验。大部分工厂的领导方面，对职工群众的这种热情采取了鼓励和支持的态度。例如，公私合营祥瑞增磁厂的领导人向制管工人介绍了“连嘴打管一次成型”的经验，并且组织他们进行学习。在推广这项先进经验以后，管子托不够用了，领导方面又及时解决了这个问题，并且帮助工人调整劳动组织，进行专责分工。结果管子的生产量由平均每人每天做九根很快提高到每人每天做十七根半。
    但是，也有一些工厂的领导人对职工的热情采取了冷淡的态度。像公私合营东亚耐火材料厂今年二月订出了生产计划，工人们经过讨论以后都提出能够保证完成；这个厂的领导人就认为生产已经没有什么问题了，于是对工人们学习先进经验的要求根本不闻不问。有的工人发现原料土忽软忽硬，建议领导方面解决这个问题，车间主任反而批评工人是“强调客观困难”。结果，这个厂的产品质量不断降低，生产任务也没有完成。又如，地方国营唐山造纸厂的领导人在三月份提出了提高纸张叩解度的要求。厂里的技术人员建议采用“高浓度打浆、低浓度抄纸”的生产方法；但是领导方面不采纳这个意见，硬要低浓度打浆。结果，纸的叩解度一直不合规格。
    这些工厂的领导人对工人的积极性所采取的冷淡态度，已经影响了生产。他们应该立即认识和改正自己的错误。        石  楠
    平日不培养，临时抓一下编辑同志：
    去年六月份，无锡申新纺织厂领导方面根据上级领导机关的指示，专门组织了一个小组到各单位去总结经验。他们召开了很多会议，了解先进人物的生产、学习等各种先进事迹，写出了六个先进人物的材料。工厂党委书记看了这些材料以后认为：“这些材料没有血、没有肉，对群众的教育意义不大，应该重新总结。”于是，工厂的秘书、夜校教师和工会干部等根据党委书记的要求，又重新到各单位搜集材料。但是，材料搜集来了，党委书记看过以后就在抽屉里一放，从此再也不提这件事情了。
    这件事情发生在无锡申新纺织厂并不是偶然的。这个厂的领导人平时不重视推广先进经验和培养先进生产者的工作，只是在上级提出要求的时候临时抓一下，而事情一过又放下不管了。因此，厂里的一些先进人物和先进单位都不能经常发挥作用，工人创造的先进经验也不能得到推广。例如，唐金党小组原来是全厂第一个先进小组，因为领导方面不重视对他们的帮助和培养，现在已经一点声息也没有了。又如，工人张如友创造了斩刀油坯不流油的先进经验，领导上不但不加以推广，反而说“张如友有名利思想”。
    无锡申新纺织厂的工人们对工厂领导人员不重视先进经验和先进生产者的态度很有意见。希望他们通过这次先进生产者运动检查和纠正这种错误态度，在今后的生产中经常地重视培养先进生产者和推广先进经验的工作。
