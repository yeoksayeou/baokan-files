    Learn from Lenin on How to Wage Ideological Struggle
    Commemorating the 86th Anniversary of Lenin's Birth
    Hu Sheng
    In his revolutionary struggle practice, the great Lenin waged sharp struggles against various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies and various opportunist trends in the workers' movement. Lenin comprehensively unfolded this struggle on practical issues and on the philosophical front. The ideological and theoretical struggles Lenin engaged in all proceeded from the needs of revolutionary practice, in order to distinguish between proletarian and bourgeois thought, to continuously raise the level of consciousness of the masses, and to advance the proletarian revolutionary cause. In order to thoroughly smash various hostile ideas, Lenin often engaged in enormous scientific work under very difficult conditions. In the many polemical works Lenin left behind, sharp and clear principles and convincing logical power are expressed. Through the struggle against all kinds of anti-Marxist trends, Lenin advanced Marxism, fully demonstrating the vigorous and ever-forward-moving power of Marxism-Leninism.

    Lenin's early works clearly put forward the requirement of combining the scientific and revolutionary nature of Marxism, and in accordance with this requirement, he carried out the struggle against populism and legal Marxism. On the one hand, he refuted the subjectivist sociological views of the Populists, and on the other hand, he criticized the objectivist attitude of the Legal Marxists; they became objectivists because, in recognizing the inevitability of the development of capitalism in Russia, they stood on the position of defending capitalism. At that time, Lenin pointed out that Marxism is based entirely on objective facts, so it can be said that "materialists use their objectivism more thoroughly, more deeply, and more comprehensively than objectivists"; on the other hand, Marxists openly stand on the position of proletarian revolution, "materialism itself contains so-called partisanship, requiring that in making any assessment of events, one must stand directly and openly on the position of a certain social group." ("The Economic Content of Populism")

    Starting from the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois point of view, the problem of combining science and revolution cannot be solved. Petty-bourgeois revolutionaries build revolutionism on subjectivist illusions, and because they deviate from the principle of science, their revolutionism becomes empty talk. At the same time, a theory without revolutionism, even if it can treat some facts realistically, cannot comprehensively reveal the essence and development trend of the facts. Only Marxism can truly combine a high degree of revolutionism and a high degree of science, and as Lenin said, "not accidentally combined, but intrinsically and inseparably combined in the theory itself." ("What are the 'Friends of the People'") The proletarian revolutionary stance, which aims at the ultimate liberation of all mankind, is not at all contradictory to the scientific attitude of thoroughly revealing the entire truth of social history, and only by adhering to a highly scientific theory can the proletarian revolutionary cause be truly advanced.

    All ideological struggles and theoretical struggles cannot be separated from the principle of combining science and revolution. If the revolutionary nature of Marxism is emasculated in the name of demanding science, then in reality it is to allow Marxism and various anti-Marxist ideas to coexist peacefully, canceling out ideological struggle. Conversely, if sharp ideological struggle is not placed on a scientific basis, but the enemies of thought are treated with a simple erasure attitude, it will certainly not achieve the desired results. "Unreasonable" ideological struggle can never be convincing. We must oppose the cancellation of ideological struggle, and at the same time, we must insist on conducting ideological struggle and theoretical struggle with a truly scientific attitude. The example that Lenin set for us in this regard is what we must earnestly learn.

    Lenin never defended his program and propositions or refuted the enemy from abstract concepts. What he relied on were objective facts and a comprehensive and scientific analysis of the facts. For example, as everyone knows, in order to refute the views of the Populists, Lenin conducted a scientific study of the development of capitalism in Russia based on a large amount of factual material; in his highly scientific work "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," Lenin thoroughly exposed Kautsky's fallacy of "ultra-imperialism." Why is what is correct correct? Because it conforms to reality; why is what is wrong wrong? Because it violates reality. This is the true scientific attitude.

    The Russian Populists once tried to depict Marxism as a theory based on some absolute abstract formula. Lenin firmly denied this slander. Lenin said at the time: "No Marxist has ever regarded Marx's theory as a philosophical historical formula that must be universally followed." "Marxists undoubtedly only borrowed from Marx's theory the valuable method necessary to explain social relations, so when judging their own estimates of social relations, they are not based on nonsense like abstract formulas, but on the correctness of this estimate itself and its conformity with reality." (Ibid.) In order to show the scientific attitude of Marxism's theory and practice being linked, Lenin also specially quoted Plekhanov's words in the struggle against the Populists: "We do not want to use the authority of the great man" (i.e., Marx's authority) "to cover up our program."

    Treating Marxist theory as a rigid formula is a dogmatic attitude. Dogmatists destroy the connection between theory and practice, which is to destroy the scientific nature of Marxism. Dogmatists cannot take a single step without citing literature, and at most, in ideological struggle, they can only shout slogans that cannot kill the enemy under the cover of the so-called "authority of the great man." Lenin's style, which is completely different from dogmatism, is truly the style of an independent fighter who can defend and develop Marxism.

    Lenin's scientific nature in ideological struggle is also reflected in the fact that he also adopted a strict scientific attitude towards various reactionary trends of thought themselves. No matter how wrong a viewpoint is, if it becomes a social trend of thought, it will never arise due to the will of a few individuals; why it arises and develops must be given a scientific explanation; this scientific explanation will enable people to see how to fight against wrong trends of thought and how to thoroughly defeat them.

    Lenin regarded the analysis of the class roots and social roots of various reactionary trends as an inevitable requirement of the Marxist method. When Lenin was fighting against the Populists who called themselves "Friends of the People," he said: "If I only compare their ideas with Marxist ideas when criticizing the views of the 'Friends of the People,' then it would be departing from the materialist method. It is also necessary to explain 'Populist' ideas, pointing out the material basis of this idea in our country's modern socio-economic relations." (Ibid.) In the years after the failure of the 1905 Russian Revolution, Lenin launched a powerful attack on the revisionist trends that appeared in Russia and internationally; Lenin pointed out at the time: "Revisionism is inevitable because it has its class roots in modern society." Lenin specifically analyzed the class roots of various revisionisms, proving that it was not an accidental and temporary phenomenon, making people see that in order to overcome revisionism, a serious struggle must be carried out.

    Regarding the Second International opportunists who occupied a dominant position in the international workers' movement before the First World War and turned to the social-imperialist stance at the beginning of the war, Lenin also analyzed them with a Marxist scientific attitude while revealing their sins with anger. In an essay in 1915, Lenin said: The study of the opportunism of the Second International leaders is not to narrate their biographies, "Now what is of interest to the socialist movement is not this, but the study of the historical origin, conditions, significance, and strength of social-chauvinist thought." Lenin also said: "Opportunism is not an accidental phenomenon, not a sin, not an oversight, not an individual betrayal, but a social product of an entire historical era." ("The Bankruptcy of the Second International") As everyone knows, Lenin profoundly pointed out that the basis for the emergence of opportunism was formed during the period of relatively peaceful development of capitalism, and when a new period, that is, the stage of revolutionary action, arrives, the collapse of opportunist rule will also be inevitable. That is to say, not only is the formation of opportunist thought not accidental, but the struggle against this thought also has a reliable social and historical basis.

    It is very obvious that these analyses made by Lenin are completely conducive to launching ideological struggle. Conversely, if such an analysis is not done, various reactionary trends of thought will become phenomena that seem incomprehensible, accidentally appearing, and will also accidentally disappear, and in reality, they will reach the conclusion that they are insurmountable and can only sit and wait for their spontaneous extinction.

    The reason why Lenin was always able to strike various wrong ideas so accurately and profoundly was also because he not only refuted the final conclusions of these wrong ideas, but also profoundly analyzed the seemingly correct premises on which these wrong ideas were based. Many wrong ideas, although the absurdity of their final conclusions is hardly worth refuting, can still confuse people by relying on their one-sided basis. Thoroughly refuting this one-sided basis is to truly disarm it.

    Lenin's exposure of the epistemological roots of idealist philosophy is an example. Lenin pointed out that from a simple materialist point of view, idealist philosophy is nothing but meaningless, but dialectical materialists can see that idealist philosophy is the result of a one-sided exaggeration of one aspect, one part of the cognitive process. "Philosophical idealism is a road leading to clericalism through a school of thought in the extremely complex process of human cognition." ("On the Question of Dialectics") Obviously, only from such a point of view can the essence of idealist philosophy be truly given a scientific analysis, and can it truly be given a fatal blow. Lenin's famous work "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" does just that. In this book, Lenin delved into the interior of the bourgeois idealist philosophical system, pointing out how subjective idealists construct their absurd system from a one-sided understanding of the cognitive process, and how the various arguments within this system contradict each other. Through this criticism, Lenin comprehensively expounded the consistency of materialist epistemology and dialectics, so in this book, not only was the idealist system thoroughly destroyed, but Marxist philosophy was also given new development.

    Like in philosophy, in the actual revolutionary movement, if one side of the complex actual life is isolated and exaggerated, various opportunist conclusions will be drawn. Lenin once pointed out that reformism and anarchism "both seize on a certain aspect of the workers' movement at will, and develop the one-sided view into a theory" ("The Division in the European Workers' Movement"). The Second International opportunists' deceptive skills were to turn Marx's individual principles into rigid dogmas, and one-sidedly exaggerate individual facts and forms of struggle that were in line with their wishes. In response to this situation, Lenin repeatedly stated that Marxism is not a dogma, but a guide to action, and said: "Neglecting this aspect will turn Marxism into something one-sided, deformed, and lifeless, and will remove the living soul of Marxism. . . " ("On Several Characteristics of Historical Development in Marxism")

    When criticizing wrong ideas, revealing the source of their thinking methods makes the criticism fully convincing and makes it easier for the masses to get rid of the influence of these wrong ideas.

    We must adopt a correct attitude towards theoretical work in order to carry out the struggle against wrong ideas well. This is the conclusion that we should draw from learning from Lenin's example.

    In our theoretical work team, dogmatism is still the main harm at present. When studying problems, we rarely start from possessing a large amount of material and conducting specific analysis. For many practical problems, it seems that ready-made conclusions have long been available, and the task of people is only to fill in examples for these ready-made conclusions. Some people seem to think that the most powerful argument is not in the facts, but in the books, so they are willing to use citations of other people's words—authoritative and even not authoritative words—to replace independent thinking starting from reality. On the other hand, some people think that they are independent thinking, but they are speculating and guessing out of touch with reality. Under the habit of dogmatism, the phenomenon of simplifying and one-sidedly understanding Marxism is bound to arise. We sometimes ignore the complex situation in actual life, and simply understand the difference between bourgeois thought and proletarian thought, the difference between right and wrong, and one-sidedly absolutize individual elements in this difference. Doing so can only lead us to the wrong path. The habit of dogmatism is also reflected in ideological criticism work. Our criticism of bourgeois idealism in recent years has been of great significance. However, our criticism is often not accurate and powerful enough. We mostly limit ourselves to making a simple comparison between Marxist conclusions and wrong conclusions, without deeply giving wrong theories a scientific analysis, and sometimes we also produce some distortions of specific facts and arguments due to not fully mastering the relevant materials and not fully studying the object of debate. We sometimes say that the object of criticism is crazy babbling that has neither social roots nor theoretical basis, which can only make people feel that it is superfluous to carry out such criticism. Some people seem to think that in fighting against hostile ideas, it is not necessary to pay attention to scientific nature—as long as you hit hard, it doesn't matter if you don't hit accurately. But in fact, to hit hard, you must hit the point, and if you don't hit accurately, you won't be hard. If, because a comprehensive analysis has not been made of the opponent, even one's own positive arguments fall into a kind of one-sidedness, then the desired effect cannot be achieved.

    Theory must be closely integrated with actual life in order to play a role in practice in turn. Theory should also be able to continuously create new things with the progress of practice. The policy advocated by our party in theoretical work is the policy of combining theory and practice, which is the Marxist-Leninist policy that is opposed to subjectivism and dogmatism. Only on the basis of the unity of theory and practice can there be a high degree of scientific nature, and only then can there be a high degree of revolutionism. According to this policy, we should, as Lenin said, on the one hand, resolutely safeguard the principles of Marxism-Leninism, "uphold the theory that we are absolutely convinced is correct and oppose all unfounded attacks and all attempts to corrupt it," and on the other hand, "we do not regard Marx's theory as something immutable and sacred; on the contrary, we are deeply convinced that it only laid the foundation for a science, and socialists who do not want to lag behind actual life should advance this science in all aspects." ("Our Program") Learning Lenin's style to carry out ideological struggle and theoretical struggle, and constantly advancing the theory of Marxism, should be the direction of our efforts.

    向列宁学习怎样进行思想斗争
    纪念列宁诞生八十六周年
    胡绳
    伟大的列宁在他一生的革命斗争实践中跟各种资产阶级的、小资产阶级的思潮和在工人运动中的各种机会主义思潮进行了尖锐的斗争。列宁在实际问题和在哲学战线上全面地展开了这种斗争。列宁所进行的思想斗争和理论斗争都是从革命实践的需要出发的，是为了划清无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的区别，为了不断提高人民群众的觉悟程度，为了推进无产阶级的革命事业。列宁为了彻底粉碎各种敌对思想，常常在很困难的条件下从事巨大的科学工作。在列宁所遗留下来的许多论战著作中表现着尖锐明确的原则性和使人信服的逻辑力量。通过对形形色色的反马克思主义思潮的斗争，列宁向前发展了马克思主义，充分显出了马克思列宁主义的永远向前进展的生气勃勃的力量。
    列宁早年的著作即已鲜明地提出了马克思主义的科学性和革命性相结合的要求，并且按照这种要求进行了反对民粹主义和合法马克思主义的斗争。他一方面驳斥了民粹派的主观主义社会学观点，一方面又批判了合法马克思主义者的客观主义态度；他们之所以成为客观主义者，是因为他们在承认俄国资本主义发展的必然性时，站到了为资本主义做辩护的立场上面。当时列宁曾指出，马克思主义是完全根据客观事实来立论的，所以可以说，“唯物主义者运用自己的客观主义比客观主义者更彻底，更深刻，更全面”；另一方面，马克思主义者是公开站在无产阶级革命立场上的，“唯物主义本身包含有所谓党性，要求在对事变做任何估计时都必须直率而公开地站到一定社会集团的立场上”。（“民粹主义的经济内容”）
    从资产阶级和小资产阶级观点出发，不能解决科学性和革命性相结合的问题。小资产阶级革命家把革命性建筑在主观主义的空想上面，而由于他们背离了科学性的原故，他们的革命性也就会变成空谈。同时，那种没有革命性的理论，即使能够实事求是地对待某部分的事实，也不能全面揭发事实的本质和发展的趋势。只有马克思主义才能够真正把高度的革命性和高度的科学性结合起来，而且像列宁所说的，“不是偶然地结合起来，而是把二者内在地和不可分割地结合在这个理论本身中。”（“什么是‘人民之友’”）以解放全人类为最终目的的无产阶级革命立场是同彻底揭发社会历史的全部真象的科学态度一点也不矛盾的，而且只有坚持高度科学性的理论才真正有利于无产阶级的革命事业。
    一切思想斗争和理论斗争都不能脱离科学性和革命性相结合的原则。如果在要求科学性的名义下阉割马克思主义的革命性，那在实际上就是使马克思主义和各种反马克思主义思想和平共处，取消了思想斗争。反之，如果不是尖锐的思想斗争摆在科学性的基础上，而是用简单的抹杀态度对待思想的敌人，就一定不能取得应有的战果。“不讲道理”的思想斗争从来是不能说服人的。我们必须反对取消思想斗争，同时必须坚持用真正科学的态度来进行思想斗争和理论斗争。列宁在这方面给我们做的榜样是我们必须认真学习的。
    列宁从来不是从什么抽象概念出发来辩护自己的纲领和主张，来驳斥敌人。他所依靠的是客观的事实，是对事实的全面的、科学的分析。例如，大家知道，列宁为了驳倒民粹派的观点，以大量事实材料为依据进行了对俄国资本主义的发展的科学研究；列宁在“帝国主义论”这部高度科学性的著作中彻底揭穿了考茨基的“超帝国主义”的谬论。正确的为什么是正确？因为它符合于实际；错误的为什么是错误？因为它违反实际。这就是真正的科学态度。
    俄国的民粹主义者曾经想把马克思主义描画成是从某种绝对的抽象公式出发的理论。列宁坚决否定了这种诬蔑。列宁当时说：“从来也没有一个马克思主义者把马克思的理论当做什么必须普遍遵行的哲学历史公式。”“马克思主义者从马克思理论中无疑地只是借用了阐明社会关系所必需的宝贵方法，所以他们在评判自己对社会关系的估计时，完全不是以抽象公式之类的胡说为标准，而是以这种估计本身的正确性及其与现实的相符合为标准的。”（同上）为了表明马克思主义的理论和实际相联系的科学态度，列宁在反对民粹派的斗争中还特别引用了普列汉诺夫的话：“我们决不想以伟人的威信”（即马克思的威信）“来掩护自己的纲领。”
    把马克思主义的理论当做死板的公式是教条主义的态度。教条主义者破坏了理论和实际的联系，也就是破坏了马克思主义的科学性。教条主义者离开了文献的引证不能走一步路，在思想斗争中至多也只是在所谓“伟人的威信”的掩护下发出不能致敌死命的呐喊。跟教条主义完全不同的列宁的作风才真正是能够捍卫和发展马克思主义的独立的战士的作风。
    列宁在思想斗争中的科学性还表现在他对待各种反动思潮本身，也是采取严格的科学态度的。不论怎样错误的观点，如果成为一种社会思潮，那就决不会是由于个别人的意志而产生；它为什么会产生和发展，一定是能够给以科学的说明的；这种科学说明就会使人们看到怎样去同错误思潮斗争以及怎样才能够把它彻底战败。
    列宁把分析各种反动思潮的阶级根源和社会根源看作是马克思主义的方法的必然的要求。列宁在跟自称为“人民之友”的民粹派作斗争时曾说：“如果我在批评‘人民之友’的观点时只限于把他们的思想和马克思主义思想加以对照，那就会是离开了唯物主义的方法。还必须说明‘民粹主义’思想，指明这种思想在我国现代社会经济关系中的物质基础。”（同上）在1905年的俄国革命失败后的年代里，列宁展开了对于在俄国和在国际间出现的修正主义潮流的有力的抨击；列宁当时指出：“修正主义之所以不可避免，是因为它在现代社会中有其阶级的根源。”列宁具体地分析了各种修正主义的阶级根源，证明它不是偶然的暂时的现象，使人看到，为克服修正主义，必须进行严肃的斗争。
    对于在第一次世界大战前在国际工人运动中占着统治地位并在大战一开始后转入社会帝国主义立场的第二国际机会主义者，列宁在充满愤怒地揭发他们的罪恶的时候，也用马克思主义的科学态度对他们进行了分析。列宁在1915年的一篇论文中说：研究第二国际领袖们的机会主义并不是要叙述他们的传记，“现在对于社会主义运动有兴味的并不在此，而在研究社会沙文主义思潮之历史的起源、条件、意义和力量。”列宁又说：“机会主义不是一种偶然的现象，不是一种罪孽，不是一种疏忽，不是个人的叛变，而是整个历史时代的社会产物。”（“第二国际的破产”）像大家所知道的，列宁深刻地指出在资本主义比较和平发展的时期形成了产生机会主义的基础，而在一个新的时期即革命行动的阶段到来的时候，机会主义统治的崩溃也将是不可避免的。这就是说，不但机会主义思潮的形成不是偶然的，而且反对这种思潮的斗争也是有可靠的社会历史基础的。
    列宁所做的这些分析，很明显地，是完全有利于展开思想斗争的。反之，如果不做这种分析，各种反动思潮就会成为好像是不可理解的、偶然地出现，也将偶然地消失的现象，因而在实际上就会达到它们是不可克服的结论，只好坐待它们的自生自灭。
    列宁之所以总是能够对各种错误思想打击得十分准确而深刻，还因为他不仅对这些错误思想的最后结论加以驳斥，而且深刻地剖析了这些错误思想所依据的似是而非的前提。有许多错误思想，虽然其最后结论的荒谬程度几乎不值得一驳，但是仍能靠它的片面性的根据而使人迷惑。彻底地驳倒这种片面性的根据，才是真正解除了它的武装。
    列宁对于唯心主义哲学的认识论根源的揭发就是一个榜样。列宁指出，从简单的唯物主义观点看来，唯心主义哲学不过是毫无意义的东西，但辩证唯物主义者却能看出，唯心主义哲学乃是对认识过程中的一个方面，一个部分片面地夸张的结果。“哲学唯心主义是经由人类极复杂的认识过程中一种流派引向僧侣主义的道路”。（“谈谈辩证法问题”）显然，只有从这样的观点出发才能真正给与唯心主义哲学的本质以科学的分析，才真正能给它以致命的打击。列宁的名著“唯物主义和经验批判主义”就是这样做的。列宁在这部著作中深入到了资产阶级唯心主义哲学体系的内部，指出主观唯心主义者怎样地从对于认识过程的片面的了解而构成他们的荒谬的体系，这个体系的内部各个论点怎样地互相矛盾。列宁通过这种批评全面地阐明了唯物主义认识论和辩证法的一致性，因此在这部著作中，不仅彻底摧毁了唯心主义的体系，而且使马克思主义哲学得到了新的发展。
    像在哲学上一样，在实际革命运动中，如果把复杂的实际生活中的一个侧面孤立起来，夸大起来，就会得出各种机会主义的结论。列宁曾指出，改良主义和无政府主义“这两种思想都是随便抓住工人运动中的某一方面，把片面性的观点发展成为一种理论”（“欧洲工人运动中的分岐”）。第二国际的机会主义者们的骗人本领就是把马克思的个别原理变成僵死的教条，片面地夸大个别的合于他们心意的事实和斗争形式。针对这种情形，列宁反复申述，马克思主义不是教条，而是行动的指南，并且说：“忽视这一方面，就会把马克思主义变成为一种片面，畸形和毫无生气的东西，就会剜去马克思主义的生动灵魂。……”（“论马克思主义历史发展中的几个特点”）
    在批判错误思想时，揭露其思想方法的根源，就使得批判具有充分的说服力量，使得群众易于摆脱这种错误思想的影响。
    必须以正确的态度对待理论工作，才能很好地进行同错误思想的斗争，这是我们从学习列宁的榜样应当得到的结论。
    在我们的理论工作队伍中，教条主义仍然是当前的主要危害。我们在研究问题时，很少从占有大量材料，进行具体分析下手。对于许多实际问题，好像都早已有了现成的结论，人们的任务只是为这些现成的结论填上例证。有人好像认为最有力的论据并不在事实中，而在书本上，因此他们愿意用引证别人的话——权威的以至并不权威的话来代替从实际出发的独立思考。另一方面，也有些人自以为是独立思考，但他们是脱离实际地平空地揣测和猜想。在教条主义的习气下，必然产生把马克思主义简单化、片面化的现象。我们有时不顾实际生活中的复杂情况，而简单化地了解资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想的区别，正确和错误的区别，把这种区别中的个别要素片面地绝对化起来，这样做，只能使我们自己走到错误的路上。教条主义的习气也反映在思想批判工作中。我们近年来对资产阶级唯心主义的批判是有很大意义的。但是我们的批判往往还不够准确和有力。我们多半只限于把马克思主义的结论同错误的结论作简单的对比，而没有深入地给错误理论以科学的分析，有时还由于没有充分掌握有关的材料，没有充分研究辩论的对象，产生一些对于具体事实和论点的歪曲。我们有时把批判的对象说成是既无社会根源又无理论根据的疯狂的呓语，这只能使人觉得进行这种批判是多余的事情。有人好像以为，在同敌对思想作战时，可以不必重视科学性——只要打得狠，那怕打得不准也可以。但其实要打得狠就必须命中要害，打得不准也就不会狠。如果因为对论敌没有做全面的分析，以至自己正面的论点也陷入一种片面性，那就更不能收到应有的效果了。
    理论必须和实际生活密切结合着，才能反过来对实践起作用。理论也应当能够随着实践的进展而不断地有新的创造。我们党在理论工作上提倡的方针是理论和实践相结合的方针，这是同主观主义、教条主义相对立的马克思列宁主义的方针。在理论和实践统一的基础上才有高度的科学性，也才有高度的革命性。按照这个方针，我们就应当像列宁所说的那样，一方面，坚决维护马克思列宁主义的原则，“拥护我们绝对确信其正确的理论而反对一切毫无根据的攻击和一切妄想将其变坏的企图”，另一方面，“我们并不把马克思的理论视为一成不变和神圣不可侵犯的东西；恰巧相反，我们深信，它只是为一个科学奠定了基础，而社会主义者若不愿落后于实际生活，就应当在各方面把这个科学向前推进。”（“我们的纲领”）学习列宁的作风来进行思想斗争和理论斗争，并且不断地向前推进马克思主义的理论，这应当是我们努力的方向。
