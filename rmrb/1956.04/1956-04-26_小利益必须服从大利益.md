    Small Interests Must Subordinate to Large Interests
    Zhen Weimin

    In order to prevent flooding in the county, the leading organs of Pi County, Jiangsu Province, mobilized the masses to build several transverse embankments between the Taogou River and the Xihe River, between the Donghe River and the Sangou River, and between the Donghe River and the Wen River, at the border between Jiangsu and Shandong provinces. After the completion of these projects, it not only became difficult for the upstream Shandong area to discharge floodwaters, but also posed a great threat to the farmland in Pi County and Xuzhou Prefecture in the downstream area when the water level rose.

    After discovering this problem, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a circular on March 12, criticizing the Pi County Party Committee and other leading organs. The Provincial People's Committee has instructed the Pi County People's Committee to demolish these projects before April 5, and to make a comprehensive plan for future water conservancy projects.

    Why did this phenomenon occur? The main reason is that the Pi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee have departmentalism thinking, only caring about solving the problem of waterlogging in their own county, and disregarding the overall interests. This practice violates the spirit of socialist common progress, unity, and cooperation. The departmentalism thinking of the leading organs of Pi County has caused serious consequences of wasting manpower and resources. The construction of the 20 *li* section of the Taogou River to the Xihe River alone wasted more than 50,000 workdays of the masses.

    In the new situation of the high tide of rural cooperativization and the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of farmers for production, increasing the irrigated area and eliminating drought and flood disasters have become the urgent demands and conscious actions of the broad masses. This requires Party committees at all levels to conduct overall planning of water conservancy projects, strengthen leadership, and cherish the people's strength. When carrying out this planning, special attention should be paid to comprehensively considering the interests of the people upstream and downstream. For water conservancy projects involving more than two regions, the relevant leading departments should take the initiative to contact and jointly negotiate to avoid conflicts. At the same time, it is also necessary to constantly educate the masses to unite closely and support each other, so that small interests are subordinate to large interests, and local interests are subordinate to overall interests. Only in this way can we guide the production enthusiasm of the masses onto the correct path of increasing production and supporting the country's socialist construction. Any departmentalism thinking and practices that disregard the overall interests must be resolutely opposed.

    小利益必须服从大利益
    甄为民
    江苏省邳县领导机关为了预防本县的水涝灾害，发动群众在江苏省和山东省交界地方的陶沟河和西泇河之间，东泇河和三沟河之间，东泇河和文河之间，修筑了几道横堤。这些工程完成以后，不仅使上游山东地区遇到洪水时难以排除，而且当水位涌高的时候，对处在下游的邳县和徐州专区的农田也有很大的威胁。
    中共江苏省委发现这一问题后，已经在三月十二日发出通报，对邳县县委等领导机关提出批评。省人民委员会已经指令邳县人民委员会于四月五日前拆除这些工程，同时对今后水利工程重新作出通盘规划。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？主要是由于中共邳县县委和县人民委员会有本位主义思想，只顾解决本县的水涝灾害问题，不顾整体利益。这种做法是违反社会主义的共同前进、团结协作的精神的。邳县领导机关这种本位主义思想造成了劳民伤财的严重后果，仅修筑陶沟河到西泇河二十华里一段工程，就浪费了群众五万多个工作日。
    在农村合作化高潮和农民生产热情空前高涨的新情况下，增加灌溉面积，消灭旱涝灾害已经成为广大群众的迫切要求和自觉行动。这就需要各级党委对水利工程进行全面规划，加强领导，爱惜民力。在进行这项规划的时候，应该特别注意全面考虑上下游人民的利益。凡是关系到两个以上地区的水利工程，有关领导部门都应该主动联系，共同协商，避免矛盾。同时还要经常教育群众亲密团结、相互支援，小利益服从大利益、局部利益服从整体利益。只有这样，才能把群众的生产热情引导到为增加生产，支援国家社会主义建设的正确道路上来。任何不顾整体利益的本位主义思想和作法，都必需坚决反对。
