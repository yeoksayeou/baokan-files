Isepp, complained on April 17th about the Philippines' trade being dominated by the United States. He demanded that the Philippines break free from the trade shackles imposed by the United States on its commerce and turn to Asia to find new trade outlets. He said the Philippines was "dominated by the United States" in trade. He emphasized that the Philippines needs to conduct a realistic study of its foreign trade situation. He said, "If the government can formulate trade plans with our Asian neighbors," the Philippines will easily be able to conduct trade worth millions of dollars with Asian countries.

    菲律宾工业界人士主张
    向亚洲寻找新的贸易出路
    新华社18日讯  马尼拉消息：菲律宾工业协会执行秘书阿·布·伊西普四月十七日抱怨菲律宾在贸易上受着美国的支配。他要求菲律宾解除它的商业所受到的美国的贸易束缚，转向亚洲寻找新的贸易出路。他说菲律宾在贸易上“受着美国的支配”。他强调指出菲律宾需要对自己的对外贸易状况重新进行一次实事求是的研究。他说：“如果政府能够拟定出同我们的亚洲邻国的贸易计划”，菲律宾将很容易就能同亚洲国家进行数以百万美元计的贸易。
    在这以前菲律宾众议员巴托列麦·卡班班四月十日在宿务发表公开演讲，要求重新审查美菲关系。他要求无条件废除菲律宾驻美大使罗慕洛和美国前财政部长斯奈德签订的协定，并且重新审查“美菲联防条约”、季里诺—福斯特协定、菲美航空条约和美菲军事基地协定等。
