    Textile Worker Who Consistently Completed Her Plan for Twelve Consecutive Months
    Song Chunying, a spinner at the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, consistently completed the state plan evenly for twelve consecutive months from March 1955 to February 1956. The amount of roller flower she produced was 1,229 taels less than the state plan within the year. She has been named an advanced producer of the factory three times in a row.
