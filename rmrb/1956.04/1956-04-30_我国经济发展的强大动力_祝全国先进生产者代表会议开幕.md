    The Powerful Engine of China's Economic Development
    Congratulations on the Opening of the National Conference of Advanced Producers

    The National Conference of Advanced Producers is scheduled to open today. This conference marks the formation of the advanced producer movement into a nationwide and extensive mass movement. This movement will greatly promote the rapid advancement of China's socialist construction.

    The rapid and vigorous development of the advanced producer movement across the country is by no means accidental, but has deep social roots.

    In our country, where the working class has become the master of the state, when workers fully understand that labor is for their own benefit, and understand that individual interests are consistent with national interests, the enthusiasm and creativity of workers in production are unstoppable, and the role of this enthusiasm and creativity is extremely significant. This is an objective law. However, to correctly understand and apply this objective law, and to fully unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, it is also necessary to rely on the leadership of the Party, to implement the Party's policies, and to carry out a series of ideological and organizational work. In recent years, the Party's policy of relying on the working class has been implemented in enterprises, propaganda and education on the general line of the transition period has been carried out among the working class and the people of the whole country, workers' lives have been gradually improved with the development of production, and workers' cultural and technical levels have been raised, which has greatly improved the socialist consciousness and organizational level of the working masses; at the same time, economic and political work in enterprises has also accumulated some experience. These are important conditions for the smooth development of the advanced producer movement today. Under these conditions, due to the impact of the upsurge of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce since last winter—that is, the high tide of the socialist revolution—and the instructions of the Party Central Committee on developing China's industry and cultural and educational undertakings more, faster, better, and more economically, a high tide of socialist construction to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule has been launched among the broad masses of workers, staff, and intellectuals, and the advanced producer movement has been vigorously developed under such circumstances.

    As the Party Central Committee pointed out: The advanced producer movement is a very broad and profound mass movement, and it is a powerful driving force for the development of China's socialist economy. In the past few months, many advanced individuals and advanced units have overcome one difficulty after another, broken old quotas time and time again, and created new production records time and time again, and some of them have completed the workload of the First Five-Year Plan. Their heroic actions have inspired and educated the people of the whole country, making people clearly see the unparalleled superiority of China's socialist system, and making people feel intimately that a happy socialist life is being created by our own hands. We are full of confidence that the First Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy will definitely be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

    The advanced producer movement is a mass movement to strive for continuous improvement of labor productivity, and it is a mass movement to learn science and culture and technology. Socialist construction requires a great increase in labor productivity; and the improvement of labor productivity is primarily guaranteed by the continuous development and application of advanced technology that can reduce labor. Technological progress can save social labor and use a small amount of labor to produce more products, so that the people's ever-increasing material and cultural needs can be continuously met.

    What represents the production technology level and labor productivity level of an enterprise or an economic sector is not only the high production speed and large output, but also the good quality and low cost of products, as well as the continuous increase of new products. To this end, the Party Central Committee calls on all workers and staff in the country to further promote China's economic construction under the principle of combining more, faster, better, and more economically. The key to implementing this principle lies in improving technology. Every advanced producer and every worker needs to work hard to continuously improve their proficiency and technical level in various ways.

    Due to historical reasons, our country's production technology is very backward, and we are determined to change this backward situation. The advanced producer movement reflects this desire of the broad masses of workers and staff in our country. Many famous advanced producers have improved their labor productivity almost entirely by learning and mastering new technologies, improving technical equipment, and improving production processes and labor organization. This is significantly different from the labor competition that focused on physical exertion a few years ago. Moreover, advanced workers generally cooperate closely with engineering and technical personnel when improving technology, and have obtained their helpful assistance. Many advanced scientific workers, engineering and technical personnel are not only good at innovating and creating in technology themselves, but also good at guiding and helping workers and young people in technological innovation and creation. The close cooperation between workers and intellectuals on the production front will undoubtedly greatly promote the development of socialist production and will make progress in our country's production technology come faster.

    In our efforts to learn technology and overcome technical backwardness, we have received selfless assistance from the great Soviet Union and assistance from all fraternal countries. This time, at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Soviet Trade Union has sent more than sixty well-known advanced producers to our country. They will spread their advanced experience according to industry and occupation. Chinese workers will make full use of this valuable opportunity to earnestly learn and specifically apply their advanced experience in order to greatly improve our production efficiency and technical level. Of course, in order to eliminate backwardness, Chinese workers must not only learn from the advanced experience of workers in the Soviet Union and various fraternal countries, but also learn from the advanced technology and advanced experience of all other countries in the world.

    The advanced producer movement requires constantly breaking old quotas and working according to new methods. However, if conservative thinking and bureaucratic work style exist in the enterprise, it will hinder the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and the utilization of the enterprise's potential capabilities. This requires carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below, so that the leaders of the enterprise can correctly grasp the situation, improve their leadership methods and leadership style, stand at the forefront of the movement, and lead the masses to continuously advance.

    Among various departments or enterprises, among various units within an enterprise, and among the working masses, there are often contradictions between the advanced and the backward. The method to solve this contradiction is for the advanced to help the backward, the backward to catch up with the advanced, to learn from each other, to help each other, to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, in order to achieve common improvement.

    Practice in the past few months has proved that the advanced producer movement cannot but sharply expose the conservative thinking and bureaucratic work style within our enterprises, and expose the contradictions between the advanced and the backward from the very beginning. We must use the method of the advanced leading the backward, the method of criticism and self-criticism, to solve this contradiction in an organized, large-scale, and continuous manner, and promote socialist construction forward.

    Today, more than 6,000 representatives of advanced producers from all over the country are gathering in the capital of the motherland. At this conference, the experiences of advanced producers will be exchanged, and some issues related to the leadership of the movement will be discussed based on the experience of carrying out the advanced producer movement across the country. We believe that the conference will be able to complete these tasks very well. Through this conference, the advanced producer movement will be carried out more widely, deeply, and persistently, so that the advanced producer movement will truly become a powerful driving force for the development of China's socialist economy.

### 我国经济发展的强大动力  祝全国先进生产者代表会议开幕

    我国经济发展的强大动力
    祝全国先进生产者代表会议开幕
    全国先进生产者代表会议定于今天开幕。这个会议标志着先进生产者运动已经形成为一个全国性的广泛的群众运动。这个运动将要大大地推进我国的社会主义建设事业迅速前进。
    先进生产者运动在全国迅速地蓬勃地开展起来，这决不是偶然的事情，而是有着深刻的社会根源的。
    在工人阶级已经成为国家主人的我们国家里，当着工人彻底了解到劳动是为了自己，了解到个人利益和国家利益相一致的时候，工人在生产中发挥出来的积极性和创造性是不可抑制的，这种积极性和创造性的作用是异常巨大的。这是一个客观规律。但是，正确地认识和运用这个客观规律，把工人群众的积极性和创造性充分发挥出来，还需要依靠党的领导，需要贯彻执行党的政策，需要进行一系列的思想工作和组织工作。几年来，在企业中贯彻执行了党的依靠工人阶级的方针，向工人阶级和全国人民进行了过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，随着生产的发展逐步改善了工人的生活，提高了工人的文化水平和技术水平，使得工人群众的社会主义觉悟程度和组织程度大大提高；与这同时，企业中的经济工作和政治工作也都积累了一定的经验。这些，都是今天先进生产者运动顺利开展的重要条件。在这些条件下，由于去年冬季以来所掀起的农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造的高潮——即社会主义革命高潮的影响，和党中央关于又多、又快、又好、又省地发展我国的工业和文教事业的指示，便在广大职工和知识分子当中，掀起了提前完成第一个五年计划的社会主义建设高潮，先进生产者运动就是在这样的情况下蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来的。
    正像党中央所指出的：先进生产者运动是十分广泛和深刻的群众运动，是我国社会主义经济发展的强大动力。几个月来，许多先进人物和先进单位克服了一个又一个的困难，一次又一次地突破了旧定额，一次又一次地创造了新的生产纪录，其中一部分人和一部分单位已经完成了第一个五年计划的工作量。他们的英勇的行动鼓舞着和教育着全国人民，使人们鲜明地看到我国社会主义制度的无比优越性，使人们亲切地感觉到美满的社会主义生活正在用我们自己的手缔造起来。我们充满着这样的信心：发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划，一定能够提前完成和超额完成。
    先进生产者运动是争取不断提高劳动生产率的群众运动，是学习科学、学习文化技术的群众运动。社会主义建设事业要求大大提高劳动生产率；而提高劳动生产率首先是依靠不断发展和运用能够减轻劳动的先进技术来保证的。技术进步可以节省社会劳动，可以使用少量的劳动生产较多的产品，这样，就可以不断满足人民日益增长的物质文化生活的需要。
    代表一个企业、一个经济部门的生产技术水平和劳动生产率水平的，不仅是生产的速度高，产量大，而且是产品的质量好和成本低，以及新产品的不断增加。为此，党中央号召全国职工，在又多、又快、又好、又省相结合的方针下把我国的经济建设更推进一步。贯彻这个方针，关键在于提高技术。每个先进生产者、每个工人都需要努力以各种各样的方法来不断地提高自己的熟练程度和技术水平。
    由于历史的原因，我国的生产技术是十分落后的，我们要决心改变这种落后状况。先进生产者运动反映了我国广大职工的这种愿望。许多著名的先进生产者，他们提高劳动生产率的途径，几乎都是学习和掌握新技术，改进技术设备，改善生产过程和劳动组织。这跟几年以前的着重在拚体力的劳动竞赛比较起来，有显著的差别。并且，先进工人在改进技术的时候，一般都能跟工程技术人员密切合作，取得了他们有益的帮助。有不少先进的科学工作者、工程技术人员不但善于自己在技术上革新和创造，而且也善于指导和帮助工人和青年在技术上的革新和创造。工人和在生产战线上的知识分子亲密合作，这无疑将会大大地推动社会主义生产的发展，将会使我国生产技术方面的进步来得更快。
    我们在学习技术，克服技术落后方面的努力，得到了伟大苏联的无私的帮助，得到了一切兄弟国家的帮助。这次，应中华全国总工会邀请，苏联工会派了六十多位著名的先进生产者来到我国。他们将按产业、按工种来传播他们的先进经验。我国工人将要充分利用这个宝贵的机会，认真学习和具体运用他们的先进经验，以便大大提高我们的生产效率和技术水平。当然，为了消除落后状态，中国工人不仅要学习苏联和各个兄弟国家的工人们的先进经验，而且也要学习所有其他世界各国的先进技术和先进经验。
    先进生产者运动要求不断地打破陈旧定额，按照新的方法进行劳动。但是如果企业中存在着保守思想和官僚主义作风，就会阻碍群众的积极性、创造性的发挥和对企业潜在能力的利用。这就需要开展批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，使企业的领导者能够正确地掌握情况，改进自己的领导方法和领导作风，站在运动的前头，领导群众不断地前进。
    在各部门或各企业中间，在企业内部各单位之间，在工人群众中间，经常存在着先进和落后的矛盾，解决这种矛盾的方法便是先进帮助落后，落后赶上先进，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，以便达到共同提高。
    几个月来的实践证明，先进生产者运动一开始就不能不尖锐地揭露我们企业内部的保守思想和官僚主义作风，揭露先进和落后的矛盾。我们必须以先进带动落后的方法，批评和自我批评的方法，有组织地、大规模地、不断地解决这种矛盾，推动社会主义建设前进。
    今天，全国六千多名先进生产者代表在祖国的首都集会，在这次会议上将要交流先进生产者的经验，并且将根据全国各地开展先进生产者运动的经验来讨论运动领导方面的一些问题。我们相信，会议一定能够很好地完成这些任务。通过这次会议，将要把先进生产者运动更加广泛更加深入地、持久地开展下去，使先进生产者运动真正成为发展我国社会主义经济的强大动力。
