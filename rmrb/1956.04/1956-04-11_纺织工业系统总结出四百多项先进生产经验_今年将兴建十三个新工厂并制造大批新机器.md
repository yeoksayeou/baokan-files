Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The textile industry system has recently summarized and compiled more than 400 advanced production experiences. Among them, nearly 200 advanced experiences with universal significance are prepared to be organized for exchange and promotion at the National Textile Industry Advanced Producers Representative Conference to be held on April 11.

Among the advanced experiences that have been summarized and appraised, more than 190 are related to improving product quality. For example, Xu Guiying, a weaving worker at the State-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, created a new method for checking cloth surfaces. From 1951 to 1955, except for six pieces of substandard cloth in the middle three months, the quality was always 100%. More than 60 advanced experiences in printing and dyeing have been summarized. For example, the use of a vulcanized dye immersion box continuous dyeing machine to replace the current dyeing vat or padding mangle not only improves labor productivity, but also greatly improves product quality. Zou Xusheng, a 71-year-old engineer from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry, has researched and created a sun-dyeing method that has transformed the traditionally black Xiangyun yarn silk into colorful and beautiful fabrics.

In addition, there are many advanced experiences related to improving labor productivity, saving raw materials, and improving workers' working conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th. This year, thirteen factories in China's textile industry system will start construction, including nine cotton spinning mills and cotton textile mills, one printing and dyeing factory, one silk reeling factory, one ramie factory, and an expanded man-made fiber factory. This year, the workload of basic construction in the textile industry has increased by more than 74% compared with last year.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th. With the increasing development of the textile industry, the production tasks of the national textile machinery manufacturing industry have greatly increased this year. For cotton textile machinery alone, the planned output this year has increased by 176% compared with last year. In terms of new product design and trial production, in addition to the trial production and production of complete sets of printing and dyeing combined machines and the manufacture of complete sets of equipment for factories producing tire cord fabrics required for automobile tires, the design of 66 new types of machines such as automatic silk reeling machines and multi-arm silk weaving machines has now begun. In the first quarter, a variety of new machines such as rope washing machines, printing pattern reduction machines, and combined cloth picking and folding machines have been successfully trial-produced.

    纺织工业系统总结出四百多项先进生产经验
    今年将兴建十三个新工厂并制造大批新机器
    据新华社10日讯　纺织工业系统最近总结和整理出了四百多项生产方面的先进经验。其中近二百项带有普遍意义的先进经验，准备在四月十一日召开的全国纺织工业先进生产者代表会议上组织交流和推广。
    已经总结和鉴定过的先进经验中，有一百九十多项是有关提高产品质量的。如国营天津第二棉纺织厂织布工人许桂荣，创造出了新的检查布面操作法，她在1951年到1955年中，除了中间的三个月出了六匹次布以外，质量一直是100％。总结出来的印染方面的先进经验有六十多项。其中如采用了硫化染料浸染箱连续染色机以代替目前的染缸或浸轧机操作，不但提高了劳动生产率，而且大大提高了产品的质量。广东省工业厅七十一岁的工程师邹旭升所研究和创造的晒染法，使历来只能生产黑色的香云纱绸，变成了五颜六色的美丽织品。
    此外，还有不少是和提高劳动生产率、节约原材料和改善职工劳动条件有关的先进经验。
    据新华社10日讯　我国纺织工业系统今年将有十三个工厂动工兴建，其中包括九个棉纺厂和棉纺织厂、一个印染厂、一个缫丝厂、一个苎麻厂和一个扩建的人造纤维厂。今年，纺织工业基本建设的工作量，比去年增加了74％以上。
    据新华社10日讯　随着纺织工业的日益发展，今年全国纺织机械制造工业的生产任务已大大增加，光是棉纺织机械一项，今年的计划产量就比去年增加了176％。在新产品的设计和试制方面，今年除了试制、生产全套印染联合机器，制造生产汽车轮胎所需的帘子布工厂的全套设备以外，现在已经开始进行自动缫丝机、多臂织绸机等六十六种新式机器的设计工作。第一季度，绳状洗布机、印花图案缩小机、捡布码布联合机等多种新机器已经试制成功。
