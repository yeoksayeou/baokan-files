In the fine spinning workshop of the Chongqing Public-Private Joint Venture 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory, a new record for spindle doffing without yarn breakage has recently been continuously achieved. The best workers have reached a maximum record of doffing more than 500 spindles without a single break.

In the past, almost every spindle doffed in this workshop would result in a yarn break. In March, the Yan Guangqun model team first proposed a competition to doff 100 spindles without breakage within a month. On April 2nd, Zeng Zhaohui, a doffing worker, first created a record of doffing 15 spindles without breakage in one day. Following this, Geng Suying, a Communist Party member, boldly changed the operating method, replacing the past method of pulling one yarn, inserting one tube, and throwing one yarn with a method of pulling two yarns and then simultaneously inserting tubes and throwing yarns, creating a new record of doffing 28 spindles without breakage on the same day. By April 15th, approximately 30 people had already achieved doffing over 400 spindles without breakage.

Due to the reduction in yarn breakage during doffing, the yarn quality in this workshop has greatly improved. At the same time, due to the reduction of white waste, there has also been an increase in production.

    重庆一纺织染厂创落纱不断头新纪录
    在重庆公私合营六一零纺织染厂的细纱车间里，最近连续创造了落纱不断头的新纪录。成绩最好的工人已经达到了落五百多台不断头的最高纪录。
    这个车间过去几乎落每一台纱都要断头。三月间，燕光群模范小组首先提出了开展一个月内落一百台纱不断头竞赛的倡议。四月二日，落纱工人曾昭惠首创一天落十五台纱不断头的纪录。接着，共产党员耿素英大胆地改变了操作方法，把过去拔一个纱、插一个管、甩一个纱的方法改为拔两个纱后再同时插管和甩纱的方法，当天就创造了落二十八台纱不断头的新纪录。到四月十五日，约有三十个人已经达到落四百台纱以上不断头了。
    由于落纱断头减少，这个车间的纱支质量大大提高。同时，由于白花减少，在产量方面，也有所提高。
