    The Fengfeng Mining Bureau and Power Plant Should Stop Arguing
    By our reporter Wang Lin
    In July 1955, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry instructed the Fengfeng Power Plant to complete the construction of the 110-kilovolt high-voltage transmission line from Fengfeng to Hebi (hereinafter referred to as the Feng-He line) in the third quarter of 1956, so as to ensure that the two newly built mine shafts of the Hebi Coal Mine had electricity. In this project, in addition to the wasted time due to insufficient contact between the Fengfeng Power Plant and the Ministry of Coal Industry, which caused the first design to be reworked, the Fengfeng Power Plant (hereinafter referred to as the power plant), the Fengfeng Mining Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the mining bureau) and the Fengfeng Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the basic construction bureau) argued for two and a half months about the Feng-He line passing through the Beidayu Substation, and as a result, the completion time of the project had to be postponed to the end of this year.
    The Beidayu Substation is also a power transmission and transformation project planned to be built this year. The Feng-He line passes through here, and will occupy a position in the station that will send electricity to the Liuhegou Coal Mine (belonging to the mining bureau, not yet restored). In order to ensure the power supply for the Liuhegou Coal Mine restoration project, the mining bureau requested the power plant to carry out a "T" connection at the Beidayu outlet of the Feng-He line. This was indeed feasible. However, the power plant insisted that the "T" connection would affect safe operation. The problem was not solved until the Beijing Design Branch of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry believed that it did not hinder safe operation. The Feng-He line needs to be connected from the Beidayu Substation, which also involves the investment and construction of this substation. Before it was decided that the Feng-He line would pass through here, this substation was invested by the mining bureau and constructed by the basic construction bureau. Because the Feng-He line will occupy an outlet position of the Beidayu Substation, the project investment of this outlet part will be borne by the power plant. The Basic Construction Bureau does not undertake the part of the project invested by the power plant. He Zhufeng, the leader of the line group of the Basic Construction Department of the power plant, went to the Basic Construction Bureau for consultation. A section chief of the Basic Construction Bureau said: We only do internal contracting (contracting for the mining bureau), not external contracting. If you want us to contract, you must first contract it to the mining bureau, and then transfer it to us, or you obtain the consent of the mining bureau before we can contract. He Zhufeng went to the Comprehensive Section of the Basic Construction Department of the mining bureau. Feng Jiashu, the head of this section, said: We are contracting our own projects to others, why should we contract them from you and then transfer them to others? Needless to say, this will increase our trouble, and we have to pay stamp duty (the contracting unit has to affix stamp tax stamps on the agreement). This dragged on and on without a solution, until the Ministry of Coal Industry instructed the Fengfeng Mining Bureau to contract this project. The mining bureau still complained that the Ministry of Coal Industry did not understand the situation and listened to the power plant's side, which increased their trouble and made them spend money unnecessarily (referring to the stamp duty affixed to the agreement with the power plant to contract the Feng-He line outlet project). Because they couldn't figure it out, more than a month has passed, and the contracting agreement with the power plant has not yet been signed.
    Ni Guanghua, a technician in the Electromechanical Section of the Basic Construction Bureau, told me: "I was also present when the issue of undertaking the Feng-He line outlet project was studied. To be honest, the workload of this part of the project is very small, and it is not that we absolutely do not do external contracting projects. It is just because the power plant is difficult to deal with, so we are unwilling to deal with them." This shows that the mutual "quarrel" between these two units has long existed, and the issue of undertaking the Feng-He line outlet project is only a small problem. The 35,000-volt high-voltage transmission line from Fengfeng to Beidayu, which has now been completed, was delayed for more than two months due to "quarrels" between the two parties over the issue of crossing lines. Moreover, after the completion, the power plant put forward quality requirements outside the regulations, saying that the technical data was incomplete, and it was not in accordance with the procedures for us to accept the project before the mining bureau inspected it, etc., and refused to inspect, take over and supply power. The mining bureau and the Basic Construction Bureau said that the power plant's requirements were divorced from reality, and we believe that it is fully qualified even if they do not inspect it. It is still unknown when this line will be put into production. After the expansion project of the Dongdajing Substation was completed, it was not put into production in time due to "quarrels" between the two parties. The "quarrel" situation in the expansion project of the Hecun Substation is even more serious. After the construction of this substation project in December 1955, the mining bureau made a final settlement and let the power plant take over. The power plant refused to take over on the grounds that the mining bureau did not coil up the cables and the materials on the construction site were not cleaned up. Now the valuable electrical equipment such as cables and distribution panels, as well as building materials such as cement, are still exposed to wind and rain on this construction site. The lightning rod of the original substation was moved during the expansion. After the construction was stopped, the power plant asked the mining bureau to weld the lightning rod. However, the cadres of the mining bureau said: "If we weld it, we have to send someone to do it, which will delay a lot of effort! You will have to take over this matter sooner or later, so you should send someone to weld it." The cadres of the power plant said: "You are afraid of delaying your work, why aren't we afraid? We don't have welders." Now that spring has come and the rainy season is approaching, if the two parties continue to "quarrel," the entire substation is in danger of being completely destroyed. The Fengfeng No. 4 Mine, which is powered by this substation, will also suffer unimaginable disasters.
    In order to help these two units overcome departmentalism, the Fengfeng Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held meetings with the leaders of these departments twice and criticized them. However, the leaders of these two units did not convey the spirit of the Party Committee's opposition to departmentalism to their subordinates. Therefore, the departmentalism thinking among grassroots staff has not been criticized. Moreover, the leaders of these two units do not go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation. After the "quarrel" problem occurred, they refused to receive personnel sent by relevant departments to study the problem. Therefore, staff members argue endlessly once problems arise. Sometimes the way the leaders of the mining bureau solve problems further encourages the pride of lower-level staff. Feng Jiashu, the head of the Comprehensive Section of the Basic Construction Department of the mining bureau, said to me with great pride: "Our bureau chief and section chief sometimes personally drive a car to the power plant, or call their factory director by phone. Once, the bureau chief called him, but he didn't come, so the bureau chief called him through the municipal party committee." How can this superior attitude not encourage the development of departmentalism?
    The mutual "quarrels" between the Fengfeng Mining Bureau and the Fengfeng Power Plant have caused huge losses to the national construction cause. This situation cannot continue. The Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, and the Fengfeng Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China should help the leaders of these two units to effectively overcome departmentalism.

    峰峰矿务局和电厂不应该再扯皮了
    本报记者　王林
    电力工业部在1955年7月间，指示峰峰电厂在1956年第三季度完成架设峰峰—鹤壁集十一万伏高压输电线路（以下简称峰—鹤线）的任务，以便保证鹤壁集煤矿新建的两个矿井有电用。在这项工程中，除因为峰峰电厂同煤炭工业部联系不够，使第一次设计返工而浪费时间外，峰峰电厂（以下简称电厂）、峰峰矿务局（以下简称矿务局）和峰峰煤矿基本建设局（以下简称基本建设局）三个单位，还为峰—鹤线要通过北大峪变电站的事，争执了两个半月，结果工程的完工时间，不得不推迟到今年年底。
    北大峪变电站，也是准备在今年兴建的送变电工程。峰—鹤线通过这里，要占用该站将来往六河沟煤矿（属矿务局，尚未恢复）送电的一个位置，为了保证六河沟煤矿恢复工程的电源，矿务局要求电厂在峰—鹤线的北大峪出线部分，先行“T”型接线。这本是切实可行的。但是，电厂硬说“T”型接线会影响安全运转。直到电力工业部北京设计分院认为并不妨碍安全运转之后，问题才算解决。峰—鹤线要从北大峪变电站出线，又涉及到这个变电站的投资和承建问题。在峰—鹤线决定通过这里之前，这个变电站是由矿务局投资，由基本建设局承建的。因为峰—鹤线要占用北大峪变电站的一个出线位置，这一出线部分的工程投资，就要由电厂负责。基本建设局不承建电厂投资的这一部分工程。电厂基本建设处派线路组长何祝丰到基本建设局进行协商，基本建设局的一位科长说：我们只作内包（包矿务局的），不作外包，要让我们包的话，你就要先包给矿务局，再转给我们，或是你们取得矿务局的同意，我们再包。何祝丰找到矿务局基本建设处综合科，这个科的冯家树科长说：我们自己的工程还往外包哩，为什么要从你手里包过来再转给别人，不用说这样会给我们增加麻烦，还得让我们贴印花（承包单位要在协议书上贴印花税票）。这样拖来推去都解决不了，直到煤炭工业部指示峰峰矿务局承包这一工程后，矿务局还埋怨煤炭工业部不了解下情，偏听了电厂的一面之词，给他们增加了麻烦，使他们花了冤钱（指与电厂成立承包峰—鹤线出线部分工程协议所贴的印花）。因为他们思想搞不通，已经过了一个多月，同电厂的包工协议书还没签订。
    基本建设局机电科的技术员倪光华对我说：“研究峰—鹤线出线工程承建问题的时候，我也在场。说实在的，这部分工程的工作量很小，我们也不是绝对不作外包工程，就因为电厂的事情难办，所以我们不愿跟他们打交道。”这说明这两个单位的互相“扯皮”，早就有了，峰—鹤线出线工程的承建问题，只不过是其中很小的一个问题而已。现在已经建成的峰峰—北大峪三万五千伏的高压输电线路，双方曾因为跨线问题“扯皮”，把完工日期拖延了两个多月。而且，在完工之后，电厂又提出了规程之外的质量要求，说技术资料不全，矿务局还没验收就让我们验收不合乎手续等等，而拒绝检验、接管和送电。矿务局和基本建设局则说电厂的要求是脱离现实，他们不检验，我们就认为完全合格。这条线路究竟什么时候投入生产，现在还不知道。东大井变电站的扩建工程完工之后，也因双方“扯皮”没有及时投入生产。在和村变电站扩建工程中的“扯皮”情况，更为严重。这个变电站工程在1955年12月施工后，矿务局造了竣工决算，就让电厂接管。电厂以矿务局没把电缆盘起来，工地的物资没收拾好为理由，拒绝接管。现在这个工地上的电缆、配电盘等贵重电气器材和水泥等建筑材料，仍被风吹雨淋。原变电站的避雷针，在扩建时挪动了，在停止施工后，电厂让矿务局把避雷针焊好。而矿务局的干部说：“让我们焊，我们还得派人去，那要耽误多少功夫！这一摊子，迟早你们得接管，还是你们派人去焊。”电厂的干部说：“你们怕耽误功夫，我们为什么就不怕，我们又没有焊工”。现在春天已来，雷雨季节已近，如果双方再“扯皮”下去的话，整个变电站就有全部被毁的危险。由这个变电站供电的峰峰四矿，也将遭受难以想像的灾难。
    为了帮助这两个单位克服本位主义，中共峰峰市委曾两次找这些部门的领导人员开会，并给以批评。但是，这两单位的领导人员并没把党委反对本位主义的精神向所属人员传达。所以基层工作人员中的本位主义思想还没有被批判。而这两个单位的领导人员又不深入基层了解情况，“扯皮”问题发生之后，他们又拒绝接见有关部门派来研究问题的人员。所以，工作人员们一发生问题就无休止地争吵。矿务局领导人员有时候解决问题的方式，更助长下级工作人员的骄傲情绪。矿务局基本建设处综合科的科长冯家树很得意地对我说：“我们的局长、处长，有时就亲自坐汽车找到电厂去，或者用电话把他们的厂长叫来。有一次局长打电话叫他，他不来，局长就通过市委把他叫来了。”这种高人一等的情绪，怎能不助长本位主义的发展呢？
    峰峰矿务局、峰峰电厂的互相“扯皮”，已给国家建设事业造成巨大的损失。这种情况不能再继续下去了。煤炭工业部、电力工业部和中共峰峰市委应该帮助这两个单位的领导人员切实克服本位主义。
