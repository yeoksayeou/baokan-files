The Third Ministry of Machine Building is promoting substitute materials for water wheel pipes.

    In order to guarantee the completion of this year's water wheel production task and support agricultural production, the Third Ministry of Machine Building recently convened a meeting to exchange experiences on substitute materials for water wheel pipes. The meeting studied eight types of substitute materials for water wheel pipes that have been tested or used in various regions, and determined that six relatively good substitute materials, including thin galvanized steel sheet pipes, black iron sheet tin-plated or enameled pipes, corrugated iron pipes, ceramic pipes, cement asbestos pipes, and bamboo pipes, could be promoted in various regions. These substitute materials can be guaranteed to be supplied domestically, which ensures that the task of producing 2.5 million water wheels this year can be successfully completed. For example, the ceramic pipes trial-produced in the Linyi Special Zone of Shandong Province are made from local materials and produced locally. After trial use, their quality has proven to be very good.

    According to calculations by relevant departments of the Third Ministry of Machine Building, the use of these substitute materials can reduce the cost of water wheels by 20% to 40%, and can also save the country tens of thousands of tons of steel each year. (Mu Fang)

    第三机械工业部推广水车管子代用品
    为了保证完成今年水车生产任务，支援农业生产，第三机械工业部在最近召开了水车管子代用材料经验交流会议。这次会议研究了各地已经试验或使用的八种水车管子代用材料，确定其中薄的镀锌钢板管、黑铁皮镀锡或搪瓷管、瓦拢铁管、陶瓷管、水泥石棉管和竹管等六种比较好的代用材料可以在各地推广。这些代用材料在国内能够保证供应，这就使得今年生产二百五十万部水车的任务可以顺利完成。例如山东省临沂专区试制的陶瓷管，便是就地取材，就地生产的。经过试用证明它的质量也很好。
    据第三机械工业部有关方面计算，使用这些代用材料，可以降低水车成本20％到40％，每年还可以给国家节约几万吨钢材。（穆方）
