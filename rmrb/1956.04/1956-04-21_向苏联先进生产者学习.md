Learn from Advanced Soviet Producers
Help Solve Technical Problems
On the 17th, four Soviet machine manufacturing workers came to the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant to help solve production technical problems.

Soviet forging innovator Kovalenko demonstrated a new technology for forging mandrels. Using a tool he designed, he forged a mandrel in 17 minutes and 24 seconds. In the past, it took the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant one hour and 40 minutes to forge a mandrel.

In the past, when this factory processed the dovetail groove on the universal milling bracket, it had to go through two processes, planing and scraping, which took several hours to complete. On this day, Soviet grinder Kurkin first used a tool he designed to grind the angle of the grinding wheel, and then used the grinding wheel to grind the dovetail groove, which only took two minutes.

Gvalev Introduced Experience
The head of the delegation of the Soviet Ministry of Textile Industry and the Trade Union of Daily Use Goods Industry, Gvalev, the creator of the famous Gvalev work method, gave a detailed introduction to all the representatives at the National Textile Industry Advanced Producers Conference on the 18th on how to discover and summarize advanced experience, how to formulate measures to promote advanced experience, and how to promote and apply these experiences on a large scale.

Zhevolenkov, the director of the production department of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union's Daily Use Goods Industry Trade Union, Alexandrov, the leader of the maintenance team of the fine yarn workshop of the Florov Mixed Cotton United Factory in Ivanovo City, and Kulikova, the deputy foreman of the fine yarn workshop of the Dzerzhinsky Textile Factory in Ivanovo City, also introduced Soviet advanced experience to the advanced producers of China's textile industry.

Single-Lane Heading Work Performance
Lobov, a member of the Soviet Coal Mine Advanced Producers Delegation and the head of the famous Kutznetsk Basin Stalin Mine heading team, gave an outstanding performance of single-lane heading work using the wedge slotting method in the steep coal seam of the Zhaogezhuang Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine on the 19th. Lobov, leading his Chinese assistant, Jia Yongzhong, a heading worker at the Zhaogezhuang Mine, only used seven hours to advance 1.8 meters and complete a cycle of operations. His heading efficiency was almost twice as high as that of ordinary heading workers at the Zhaogezhuang Mine.

Seryogin, the director of Donbass Chistyakov Deputy No. 3 Mine, and Kolesnikov, the driver of the metal pillar moving machine of the Nietsvidai Anthracite Coal Bureau, also introduced their experiences at the Kailuan Coal Mine.

Demonstration of Cotton Planting Technology
M. A. Aksenov, Soviet Socialist Labor Hero and captain of the tractor team of the Agricultural Machine Tractor Station, gave a demonstration of planting cotton with a tractor-pulled five-unit, four-row planter at the Beijing Red Star Collective Farm on the 20th.

Aksenov was invited to participate in the National Agricultural and Water Conservancy Advanced Producers Conference. Although he was not familiar with the terrain and soil conditions here during his performance today, his hourly shift workload was still more than 65% higher than that of ordinary Chinese tractor drivers; and the ridges were correct, the depth was consistent, and the planting was very even and fully met the standards.

    向苏联先进生产者学习
    帮助解决技术问题
    十七日，四名苏联机器制造工人到北京第一机床厂帮助解决生产技术问题。
    苏联锻工革新者科瓦连科，表演了锻造心轴的新技术。他用自己设计的工具，在十七分二十四秒中锻造了一个心轴。过去北京第一机床厂锻造一个心轴需要一小时四十分。
    这个厂过去加工万能铣支架上的燕尾槽的时候，要经过刨和刮研两道工序，需要几个小时才能完成。这一天，苏联磨工库尔金先用他设计的工具磨好了砂轮的角度，然后用砂轮磨燕尾槽，结果只用了两分钟。
    郭瓦廖夫介绍经验
    苏联纺织工业部及日用品工业工会代表团团长、著名的郭瓦廖夫工作法的创造者郭瓦廖夫，十八日在全国纺织工业先进生产者代表会议上向全体代表详细介绍了怎样发现、总结先进经验，怎样制定推广先进经验的措施和怎样大规模地推广和运用这些经验的经验。
    苏联日用品工业工会中央委员会生产部部长热沃伦科夫，伊万诺沃城弗洛罗夫混色棉联合工厂细纱车间保全组长亚历山大洛夫，伊万诺沃城捷尔任斯基纺织厂细纱车间副工长库丽科娃，也分别向我国纺织工业先进生产者们介绍了苏联先进经验。
    单巷掘进工作表演
    苏联煤矿先进生产者代表团团员、著名的库茨巴斯斯大林矿井掘进组长洛波夫，十九日在开滦煤矿赵各庄矿急倾斜煤层，用楔形掏槽法，出色地表演了单巷掘进工作。洛波夫带领着他的中国助手、赵各庄矿的掘进工人贾永忠，只用了七个小时就掘进了一点八公尺，作完了一个循环作业。他的掘进效率差不多比赵各庄矿一般掘进工人高一倍。
    顿巴斯齐斯恰克夫副三号矿矿长谢廖金和聂茨维达伊无烟煤矿务局金属支柱移动机司机科列斯尼可夫，也分别在开滦煤矿介绍了他们的经验。
    表演棉花播种技术
    苏联社会主义劳动英雄、农业机器拖拉机站拖拉机队队长米·阿·阿克谢诺夫，二十日用拖拉机牵引的五台四行播种机，在北京红星集体农庄进行了播种棉花的表演。
    阿克谢诺夫是应邀来参加全国农业水利先进生产者代表会议的。他今天的表演，虽然不熟悉这里的地形和土壤条件，但是他每小时的班次工作量仍然比一般中国拖拉机手超过65％以上；而且结垅正确，深浅一致，播得非常均匀，完全合乎标准。
