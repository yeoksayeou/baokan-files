	Even children have their own ideals. Although children's ideals often stem from interests and do not necessarily have any lofty purpose.
	Cao Junjie's ideal is to become a train driver.
	Perhaps some people will find it strange that a child growing up in the countryside, the son of a silversmith and farmer, would dream of becoming a train driver? Most rural children have never even seen a train. But Cao Junjie is different; not only has he seen trains, but he is also the closest of friends with them. At that time, the Northeast of the motherland was being ravaged by the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders, and his hometown—Lianhuapao Village, Yinma River, Changchun—did not provide schooling for poor children. Cao Junjie's father was unwilling to let his son be an illiterate, so he had to send him to a primary school dozens of miles away. The road was too far, and Cao Junjie had to take the train every day to go back and forth. Over time, he developed a friendship with the train. Without the train, he couldn't have gone to school at all! He was grateful to the driver who took him to school every day, and even more envious of his abilities, thinking it was so interesting to drive a train, transporting countless people and large quantities of goods from one place to another in a short while. It could cross grasslands, span rivers, and travel all over the beautiful land... Cao Junjie often dreamed that when he grew up, he would become a train driver.
	This ideal is innocent and very tenacious. Cao Junjie has been an outstanding child since he was young, smart and persevering. He has suffered for his ideal, been humiliated, and encountered disappointing setbacks. But he has never stopped pursuing it...
	After graduating from senior primary school, Cao Junjie began to strive to realize his ideal. He worked as a blacksmith in the Changchun Railway Vehicle Factory, where he was beaten and bullied; he entered a railway school full of whipping and humiliation; and he also participated in a strike with his classmates to fight for the dignity of "Chinese people." After the Japanese devils surrendered, he was driven out of the Changchun Railway Locomotive Depot after only a week of work because he refused to give gifts to the Kuomintang's operation director... After that, he was unemployed for a long time. His ideal became a castle in the air, and his hope was so渺茫!
	It was not until Changchun was liberated in 1948 that he became a true Chinese and found a loving mother! He returned to the locomotive depot and was assigned to learn to stoke the fire on the locomotive. At the beginning of the second year, he passed the exam and became a formal fireman.
	Everything in the new society surprised and moved Cao Junjie. Just talking about the relationship between superiors and subordinates, the leading comrades were so hardworking and simple, kind and approachable. They not only ate and dressed the same as the workers, treated each other as equals, but even accepted the workers' opinions so sincerely and modestly... Cao Junjie discovered for the first time that there was true equality and friendship between people. Countless new things excited his pure heart, and the flames of youth rose in his soul. He loved his work, and after determining his outlook on life, his struggle goals became clearer. He joined the Youth League and was pursuing the Party. After the Party was made public in 1949, he became a member of the Communist Party.
	How did the Party cultivate him? He entered the personnel training class and worked as a personnel officer. After studying politics in the Party school for two months, he was sent to the driver's department of the Dalian Technical School for further study—at that time, he had already been promoted to deputy driver.
	Cao Junjie felt he was too happy! Who besides the Party had ever cared for and cultivated him like this? Who besides the Party could make his ideal a reality? Thinking of the pain of studying during the puppet Manchuria period, his enthusiasm for learning became even higher. He was determined not to let the Party down and worked hard. When he felt sleepy in the summer, he would pull out his hair one by one. Not only did he study well himself, but he also sacrificed a lot of sleep to help a comrade without education complete his learning task. After graduating in eight months, he truly returned with a full load, and he improved greatly compared to before.
	In April 1954, when he received his driver's certificate, he was so excited that he almost shed tears. In the great socialist construction, the realization of this ideal added such incredible brilliance, and he could contribute more to the motherland. On this day, he was so happy that he didn't eat his meal well or sleep well. The first thing that came to his mind was the issue of how to unite and cooperate with his partners. He recalled that when he was a fireman and a deputy driver, he sometimes felt very sad when he was treated coldly by the driver. Now that he was a driver, he couldn't turn around and treat others coldly and make them sad! He deeply realized that only by uniting and cooperating well with his partners could he better exert his strength. His goal was to break the traction quota and strive for over-axle!
	Cao Junjie's urge to "over-axle" didn't just come about when he got his driver's license; it started a year earlier. During the days when he was a deputy driver, he often dreamed of driving a locomotive with unlimited potential, pulling over-axle vehicles and galloping across the vast fields of the motherland... Whenever he saw others not over-axle when they had axles to spare, he would feel anxious: the locomotive still had great potential! Although its traction capacity was fixed, maximizing its kinetic energy depended mainly on the "person" who controlled it! In the early days of liberation, the traction quota was only 1,700 tons, but now it has reached 2,250 tons. If we put in more effort, can't we break through this 2,250 tons as well?
	However, doing things is not as easy as thinking. When he drove the locomotive for the first time, running back and forth between Taolaizhao and Changchun, he was too nervous. The road was bad, with too many slopes. He didn't dare to blink, and even his breathing was uneven. He suddenly felt that when he put it into practice, he lost his direction. He felt that he was too young and his skills were poor. He was already worried that others wouldn't be convinced. If there was an accident, wouldn't it be even harder to convince people? The more he worried, the less he dared to let go. In the beginning, not only did he not over-axle, but he was often late! But his enthusiasm for over-axle didn't diminish. He went to ask the driver chief for advice.
	Driver Chief Wang Qishan helped him find the key to the delays and gave him guidance on technology. After that, he changed his operating methods, and the phenomenon of delays disappeared. However, realizing the desire to over-axle was so difficult. Every time before departure, Cao Junjie always saw a large number of fully loaded freight cars parked at the station. But, what was frustrating was that the station would not allow them to be attached. Once, he couldn't help but ask the station chief on duty, Liu Enquan:
	"Station Chief Liu, I want to over-axle every trip. Why don't you agree to attach them?"
	"The train has already been compiled according to the traction quota. If we attach more, the train will depart late, and we will be responsible!"
	Cao Junjie understood the situation and made a verbal agreement with the station: when it was his crew's turn, he would notify the station in advance and ask them to compile an over-axle train. The locomotive would also be driven out in advance, so as not to affect the train's departure on time. In this way, Cao Junjie's shift could often over-axle, often pulling more than 2,500 tons, and gained the assistance and trust of the dispatching office.
	Cao Junjie and his two partners—deputy driver Xuan Shilu and fireman Zhao Xianzhi—their enthusiasm for over-axle was constantly rising. Once, they pulled 2,800 tons from Taolaizhao back to Changchun. They were happy, but unexpectedly, they were doused with cold water.
	As soon as Cao Junjie walked into the operation duty room, the crew chief greeted him with a shout: "Cao the Great, are you creating a new record again?" The tone and attitude clearly contained some sarcasm. Listening more closely, the whole room was noisy, and the discussions among the two or three people together were also about "Cao Junjie." Some said he was an adventurer, and some said he wanted to use the over-axle bonus to buy a fancy coffin... At this time, Ma Yunsheng, the assistant section chief of the operation, was also waiting to talk to Cao Junjie. As soon as they met, he reprimanded him:
	"Cao Junjie, you can't do this again in the future. If there is an accident, our model section will be ruined?"
	Even his good friend Wang Shaogeng said to him:
	"You reckless fool, why are you pulling so much? Will not over-axle get you demoted?"
	Cao Junjie felt really uncomfortable. He thought to himself: I want to contribute a little more to the country's construction, but what I get in return is ridicule and suppression—how can there be so many personal calculations? His two partners have the same high enthusiasm for over-axle as he does, and they are still not discouraged, saying:
	"Don't listen to their nonsense. We should do what we should do!"
	That's right, do what we should do! How can a ladle of cold water extinguish the flame of enthusiasm? Cao Junjie's team then created an even higher over-axle record.
	That day, before departing from Taolaizhao, Cao Junjie discovered that there were still seventeen freight cars parked at the station. He asked the station chief, who said that another train had to be attached. Cao Junjie thought that this was a good opportunity for over-axle. He discussed it with his partners and immediately contacted the dispatching office, requesting that all seventeen cars be pulled by them. The dispatching office trustingly agreed.
	However, Cao Junjie couldn't help but be a little worried. This train was a full 3,100 tons, and no one in the section had ever pulled so much. Zhao Xianzhi smiled and said:
	"No problem. This time, it's only 300 tons more than last time. It's nothing!"
	Seeing that he was indifferent, Cao Junjie was afraid that he would relax his thinking, and quickly reminded him:
	"For these 3,100 tons, we have to work harder. Let's be happy after we get through the slope."
	So the three of them expressed their determination to each other. Zhao Xianzhi said: "Lao Xuan and I guarantee you'll have enough steam to use." Cao Junjie said: "I guarantee that the train will not be delayed and will successfully pass the slopes." As a result, they really successfully completed the task, arrived on time, and created an unprecedented over-axle record.
	But the station chief was very worried about him and advised him to be more stable. It was really a coincidence that during this period of debate, Cao Junjie's team unexpectedly had an accident.
	When that train departed from Siping, the station compiled 2,800 tons. According to the locomotive's capabilities and the road conditions at the time, 2,600 tons was enough to handle (the regulation was 1,700 tons). He wanted to drop the cars but was afraid of being late. As a result, they pulled them away and caused a stopping accident in the middle.
	Although Cao Junjie was not criticized or punished for this accident, it gave some backward elements an excuse for sarcasm. They said: This kid, all he wants to do is stand out and show off his abilities. It's not going to work. How can a greenhorn achieve great things!
	Cao Junjie felt that this had a very bad impact, and he felt sad and regretful, feeling that his skills were poor and that enthusiasm alone could not stand the test. A shadow covered his thin face, and the light in his smart eyes dimmed. The person in charge of the Party branch understood the situation and encouraged him in a timely manner: "Accidents should not be in vain. We should learn from them. We cannot be pessimistic and discouraged because of occasional failures. The revolution has also failed, Comrade Cao Junjie. I hope you find the reason for the failure and continue to over-axle in the future..." Later, the Party sent him to the Advanced Methods School of the Harbin Railway Administration. In half a month, he learned advanced experiences such as Zheng Xikun's over-axle, Li Shaoqiang's coal saving, and locomotive maintenance. When he returned to his job, he felt full of strength. He often thought of the Party's words and the words of the operation chart engineer: "At present, China's industry has not yet reached its peak, and there are not many products and raw materials to transport, but the density of trains on the railway has reached saturation. If we don't pull more and run faster, how can we meet the needs of more material exchanges?" Cao Junjie took these instructions as his own struggle goals and had a deeper understanding of the great significance of over-axle. He didn't care about the sarcasm and wholeheartedly worked hard to strive for more over-axle.
	In the spring of 1955, Cao Junjie and his two partners separated after prominently completing several "Green Street" operations (that is, not adding water, oil, or stopping in the large section). The reason was that the work performance of the three crew groups on Locomotive No. 1952 was very unbalanced. The other two groups were relatively weak. In order to reverse this imbalance and exert greater locomotive efficiency, Cao Junjie took the initiative to suggest to the leaders that his two partners be assigned to those two groups. For the sake of the overall interests, Cao Junjie had no localism or selfishness. Although he was separated from his partners, from an emotional point of view, it was not a pleasant thing.
	The backbone of the two groups was indeed strengthened, and Cao Junjie's team was not affected by the changes in personnel. Cao Junjie was good at uniting comrades. He was able to grasp his partners' ideological emotions in daily life, help them correct their wrong words and deeds with a loving attitude, use various methods to encourage their enthusiasm for over-fulfilling tasks, and give timely guidance on technology... Therefore, the two new partners cooperated with him very well. By the second half of 1955, "Green Street" was combined with "over-axle," and they could often pull more than 3,000 tons in "Green Street" operations. There was such a time:
	The Changchun station had already compiled an over-axle train for Cao Junjie's team. The dispatcher suddenly issued an order over the phone: "Reduce the axles quickly!" Because this train only had forty minutes of turnaround time after arriving at Siping Station, and a delay would affect the operation of the high-level train (special train). But Cao Junjie was eager to over-axle and confidently replied:
	"No need to reduce axles. I guarantee on-time arrival!"
	"No, this train is of great importance, and over-axle is absolutely not allowed," the dispatcher was also very firm. "If there is a delay, I can't take this responsibility!"
	When Cao Junjie's partners heard that they were going to drop cars, they were also very anxious. They all encouraged Cao Junjie: "No matter how fast you run, we guarantee that we can supply enough steam." Cao Junjie's confidence was even greater with the support of his partners. He also made a guarantee to the dispatcher: to arrive at Siping twenty-four minutes early. But the dispatcher still didn't agree.
	Cao Junjie was a little angry when he saw that the other party didn't trust him. He shouted loudly at the microphone: "If you drop the cars, I won't be able to run fast, and I can only guarantee not to be late. If you don't drop the cars, I will arrive twenty-four minutes early!" The dispatcher was puzzled: "Why is that?" "It's an ideological problem. What can I do!" The station chief, who was listening next to him, couldn't help but laugh. In the end, the dispatcher had no choice but to yield. He said unpleasantly: "Pull them away!" According to his point of view, he could only believe that Cao Junjie would not be late, and it was impossible to be early.
	Unexpectedly, when Cao Junjie drove the train to Siping, he arrived one minute earlier than he had guaranteed—arriving at the station twenty-five minutes early. Cao Junjie excitedly asked the dispatcher on the phone: "How is it?"
	"Oh, my Lao Cao, I never thought you would run so fast. Good heavens, 3,034 tons!"
	In close cooperation with his partners, Cao Junjie often took the lead in pulling fast over-axle trains on the multi-slope line between Taolaizhao-Changchun-Siping, and achieved remarkable results in the fully loaded, over-axle, and 500-ton movement. According to the 1955 summary, Cao Junjie's crew completed a total of 136 over-axle trips throughout the year, totaling 38,804 tons. A total of 186 "Green Street" runs were completed, saving 73,383 kilograms of coal.
	However, the youth of China are always moving forward, and they are never satisfied with their achievements. In the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, Cao Junjie felt that the railway transportation industry must catch up quickly and move towards a higher and more distant ideal. Therefore, he and four other chartered car groups jointly proposed to increase the traction quota.
	In March, at the Railway Advanced Producers Representative Conference, Cao Junjie was elected as a representative to attend the National Advanced Producers Conference. (Attached picture)

    理想
    白朗
    小孩子也有自己的理想。虽然孩子们的理想往往是从兴趣出发，不一定有什么崇高的目的。
    曹俊杰的理想是当火车司机。
    也许有人会觉得奇怪，一个生长在农村的孩子，一个银匠兼农民的儿子，怎么会幻想当火车司机呢？一般的乡下孩子连火车是什么样儿都没见过哩。不，曹俊杰可不一样，他不仅见过火车，同火车还是最亲密的朋友呢。那时候，祖国的东北正在日寇的铁蹄蹂躏之下，他的家乡——长春饮马河莲花泡村——没有给穷孩子们预备求学的地方，曹俊杰的爸爸又不甘心叫儿子做睁眼瞎子，只好把他送到几十里以外的小学去念书；路太远，曹俊杰每天只有坐着火车来去，天长日久，他便同火车发生了友情。没有火车，他的书根本就念不成呵！他感激每天送他上学的司机，更羡慕他的本事，觉得开火车多有趣，一会儿就把无数无数的人和大批大批的货从这个地方运到另一个地方，它可以越过草原、跨过江河、游遍美丽的土地……。曹俊杰经常幻想着：长大了一定做一名火车司机。
    这理想是天真的，也是非常顽强的。曹俊杰从小就是一个个性突出的孩子，他聪明而有毅力。他为他的理想吃过苦、受过气、也遭遇过失望的打击。但是他还是一直不放松地追求它……。
    从高小毕业以后，曹俊杰就为着实现他的理想开始了奋斗。他在长铁车辆厂当过挨打受气的铁工；进过充满了鞭笞和凌辱的铁路学校；也曾为了争取“中国人”的尊严和同学们进行过罢课斗争。日本鬼子投降以后，他为了不肯给蒋匪帮的运转主任送礼，被赶出了才工作一周的长铁机务段……这以后，便是长期的失业。他的理想变成了空中楼阁，他的希望又是多么渺茫呵！
    直到1948年长春解放，他才做了真正的中国人，找到了慈爱的母亲！他回到机务段，被派到机车上学烧火，第二年年初，考试合格，就当了正式司炉。
    新社会的一切使曹俊杰这样的惊奇和感动，单说上下级的关系吧，领导同志都是多么艰苦朴素、和霭可亲，他们不但和工人们吃穿一样，平起平坐，连工人们给他们提意见也竟那么诚恳谦虚地接受……。曹俊杰第一次发现人和人之间还有真正的平等和友谊。那数不清的新鲜事物，使他纯真的心灵激动了，在他的灵魂里升起了青春的火焰，他热爱他的工作，确定了人生观后奋斗目标更明确了，他入了团又在追求着党，1949年党公开后，他便成了一名共产党员。
    党是在怎样培养他的呢？他进过人事训练班，当过人事干事；在党校学了两个月政治后，又被送到大连技术学校司机科深造——那时候，他已经被提升为副司机了。
    曹俊杰感到他太幸福了！除了党，谁这样爱护培养过他呢；除了党，谁能使他的理想变为现实呢？一想到伪满时期学习的痛苦，学习的热情更高了。他决心不辜负党的期待，刻苦努力。夏天发睏，就一根根地拔头发；不但自己学得好，还牺牲了不少睡眠帮助一个没文化的同志完成了学习任务。八个月毕业出来，真是满载而归呵，他比以前大大地提高了。
    1954年四月，当他拿到司机证书的时候，他兴奋得差点掉下眼泪，在伟大的社会主义建设中，这理想的实现是增添了多么不可思议的光辉，他可以为祖国贡献更多的力量了。这一天，他乐得饭没吃好，觉没睡着，首先来到脑子里的是如何和伙伴们团结合作的问题，他回想自己当司炉、当副司机的时候，有时受到司机的冷漠，就感到非常难过；今天自己当了司机，可不能反转来去冷漠别人，让别人难过呵！他深深体会到，只有和伙伴们团结合作得好，才能够更好地发挥力量，他的奋斗目标就是：打破牵引定数，争取超轴！
    曹俊杰“超轴”的冲动并不是拿到司机证才有的，早在一年前就开始了。在做副司机那些日子里，他就常常梦见自己驾驶着潜力无穷的机车牵引着超轴的车辆奔驰在祖国辽阔的原野里……。每当他看到别人有轴不超，心里就发急：机车的潜力还大着哩，虽说它的牵引能力是固定的，但是发挥它的最大动能，主要还在于掌握它的“人”！刚解放那阵，牵引定数才一千七百吨，现在却达到了2，250吨。要是再努一把力，难道不同样能够突破这2，250吨吗？
    不过，事情做起来，可不像想的那么容易了。当他第一次驾驶机车，往返于陶赖昭—长春区间的时候，他可是太紧张了。这段路线路不好，坡道太多，他不但不敢眨眨眼睛，连气也喘不匀了。他突然感到一实践起来，竟没有了方向。他觉得自己年纪太轻、技术也差，本就顾虑别人心里不服，要是再出点事故，不是更难使人心服吗？顾虑越多，就越不敢放手，开始一个阶段，不但没有超轴，还常常晚点哩！但是他超轴的热情并没有减低。他去请教司机长。
    司机长王歧山帮他找出晚点的关键，并且在技术上给了他指导。以后他改变了操纵方法，晚点的现象便消灭了。可是，实现超轴的愿望又是多么不容易。每当发车前，曹俊杰总是看见车站上停着大批的满载货车，但是，急人的是车站说什么也不准挂上。一次他忍不住地去问值班站长刘恩全：
    “刘站长，每趟车我都想超轴，你们为什么不同意挂呢？”
    “列车已经按照牵引定数编好了，再挂，列车晚点出发，我们的责任就大了！”
    曹俊杰了解了这情况，便和车站订了口头合同：轮到自己的乘务便提前通知车站，请他们编好超轴列车；机车也提前开出来，绝不影响列车正点发出。这样，曹俊杰班就可以常常超轴了，经常拉到二千五百多吨，并且取得了调度室的协助和信任。
    曹俊杰和他的两个伙伴——副司机萱士禄、司炉赵宪志——超轴的热情在不断上升，有一次从陶赖昭竟拉了二千八百吨回到长春。他们正在高兴，却想不到淋了一身冷水。
    曹俊杰一走进运转值班室，乘务主任迎头就是一声：“曹大车，又创造新纪录了吗？”听那声调、看那态度，都明显地含着若干讽刺。再定神一听，满屋子乱嚷嚷，三三两两在一起议论的也是“曹俊杰”，有的说他是个冒险家，有的说他是想拿超轴奖金买口花头棺材……。这时候，运转助理段长马云升也正在等着和曹俊杰谈话呢。他一见面就训诫道：
    “曹俊杰，你以后可不能这么干了，?出了事故咱们的模范段不就砸了吗？”
    连他的好朋友王绍庚也对他说：
    “你这个虎旦（冒失鬼），拉那么多做什么，难道不超轴还能给你降职不成？”
    曹俊杰心里真难受。他暗自思量：我想的是在祖国的建设道路上多贡献一点力量，而换来的却是嘲讽和压制——个人的打算怎么会这样多呢？他的两个伙伴超轴的热情和他同样地高，现在仍然不灰心，都说：
    “别听他们那一套，咱们该怎么干就怎么干！”
    不错，该怎么干就怎么干！一瓢冷水怎能泼得灭热情的火焰？曹俊杰组紧接着又创造了更高的超轴纪录。
    那一天，从陶赖昭发车前，曹俊杰发现站上还有十七辆货车停在那里，问站长，说还得再挂一趟车。曹俊杰一想，这可是个超轴的好机会，他和伙伴们商量了一下，马上和调度室联系，要求那十七辆车全由他们拉走，调度室信任地同意了。
    但是曹俊杰不能不有点担心。这趟车整整三千一百吨，段上从来也没人拉过这么多呵。赵宪志却笑着说：
    “没问题，这回比上回只不过多了三百吨，算不了啥！”
    曹俊杰看他满不在乎，怕他思想松懈，连忙提醒他：
    “这三千一，可得大大加把劲，闯过坡咱们再高兴吧。”
    于是他们三个人互相表示了决心。赵宪志说：“我和老萱保证你有足够的汽使用。”曹俊杰说：“我保证列车不运缓，胜利闯过坡道。”结果，真的顺利完成了任务，正点到达，创造了空前的超轴纪录。
    但是站长很为他担心，劝他稳一些。说起来也真叫巧，偏偏在这议论纷纷的阶段，曹俊杰组竟意外地出了一次事故。
    那趟车从四平出发的时候，站上编了二千八百吨，按照当时的机车能力和路线情况，二千六百吨足够负担了（规定一千七百吨），想甩车又怕晚点。结果拉走了，就在中途造成了停车事故。
    这次事故，曹俊杰虽然没有受到批评和处分，却给一些落后分子造成了讽刺的借口，他们说：这小子，尽想拔尖逞能，不行嘛，小孩芽子还成得了大器！
    曹俊杰觉得这影响多不好，心里又难过又后悔，感到自己的技术差，单凭热情是经不起考验的。他瘦瘦的脸上罩上了一层暗影，那双聪明的眼睛也减弱了光芒。党总支的负责人了解了这种情况，便及时地鼓励他：“事故是不能白出的，应该从中吸取教训，不能因为偶然的失败就消极灰心，革命也失败过呀，曹俊杰同志，希望你找出失败原因，以后继续超轴……”随后，党便把他送到哈尔滨铁路管理局的先进方法学校。半个月的时间他学习了郑锡坤超轴、李绍强省煤以及机车保养等等先进经验。当他再回到工作岗位的时候，感到混身都充满了力量。他常常想着党的话，想着运行图工程师的话：“目前我国工业还没发展到最高潮，运输的产品原料还不多，而铁路上列车密度却已经达到了饱和点。假如不多拉快跑，怎么能够满足更多的物资交流的需要呢？”曹俊杰把这些指示做为自己的奋斗目标，对超轴的重大意义体会得更深了。他不去介意那些冷嘲热讽，全心全意地为争取更多的超轴而努力。
    1955年春天，曹俊杰和他的两个伙伴在突出地完成了几次“绿街”运行（就是在大区间不上水、不上油、不停车）任务后便分手了。原因是冖ㄎ1952号机车三个乘务组的工作成绩很不平衡，另外的两个组比较弱，曹俊杰为扭转这个不平衡的局面，发挥更大的机车效能，便主动向领导上建议：把他的两个伙伴分到那两个组去。为了整体的利益，曹俊杰是没有任何本位和私心的；虽然和他的伙伴们分散，单从感情上来讲，也不是一件愉快的事情。
    那两个组的骨干的确加强了，而曹俊杰组也并没因人员的变动受到什么影响。曹俊杰是善于团结同志的，他能够从日常生活中掌握伙伴们的思想情绪，以友爱的态度帮助他们纠正错误的言行，利用各种方式鼓舞他们超额完成任务的热情，并在技术上给予及时地指导……。因此，新来的两个伙伴和他合作得也非常地好。到1955年下半年，“绿街”便和“超轴”结合了，经常能在“绿街”运行中牵引三千多吨。有这么一次：
    长春站已经给曹俊杰组编好了超轴列车。调度员忽然用电话下了个命令：“赶快减轴！”因为这趟车到四平站后仅有四十分钟折返时间，一晚点就要影响高级列车（专车）的运行。但是曹俊杰超轴心切，非常自信地回答道：
    “不必减轴，我保证正点到达！”
    “不行，这趟车关系重大，绝对不允许超轴。”调度员也很坚决。“万一晚点，我是负不了这个责任的！”
    曹俊杰的伙伴们一听要甩车也很着急，他们一齐向曹俊杰鼓动：“你跑多快我们都保证供得上汽。”曹俊杰得到伙伴们的支持，信心更足了。他又向调度员提出保证：提前二十四分钟到达四平。可是调度员还不答应。
    曹俊杰看到对方不信任他，有点冒火了。他冲着送话器大声叫道：“你要是甩车我反而拉不快，只能做到不晚点；不甩车我就早点二十四分钟到达！”调度员奇怪了：“那是为什么呢？”“思想问题。有什么办法！”站长在旁边听着也禁不住笑了。争到最后，调度员只好屈服，他没好气地说：“拉走吧！”根据他的看法，他只能相信曹俊杰不至于晚点，而早点是没有可能的。
    想不到曹俊杰把车开到四平的时候，竟比他保证的时间还提前了一分钟——早点二十五分就进站了。曹俊杰兴奋地在电话里问调度员：“怎么样？”
    “哎呀，我的老曹，我哪里想到你会跑得这么快，好家伙，3，034吨哪！”
    曹俊杰在和他的伙伴们密切合作中，经常带头牵引快速超轴列车奔驰在陶赖昭—长春—四平区间多坡的线路上，在满载、超轴、五百吨运动中获得了显著的成绩。根据1955年的总结，曹俊杰乘务组全年共超轴136次，共38，804吨。“绿街”运行共完成186次，省煤73，383公斤。
    但是，中国的青年是永远向前的，他们从来不满足于既得的成绩。在农业合作化和社会主义工商业改造的高潮中，曹俊杰感到铁路运输事业必须急起直追，向更高远的理想突进。于是他又和李绍强等四个包车组共同提出了提高牵引定数的倡议。
    三月间，在铁路先进生产者代表会议上，曹俊杰当选为出席全国先进生产者大会的代表。（附图片）
