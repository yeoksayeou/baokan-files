Make Cars Run Smoothly and Save Fuel
By Our Correspondent Fu Dong

The square was packed with people. Despite the fierce wind that made it hard to open their eyes, people still stood there, unwilling to leave. Everyone wanted to see Bian Jieqiu's demonstration of his chassis lubrication method: "How can Bian Jieqiu make cars run so smoothly and save so much fuel?" Just as everyone was discussing this animatedly, a large car drove into the square. People forgot to talk, and a dozen of them immediately climbed onto the car. At this moment, someone walked behind the car, put out both hands and pushed the vehicle. People didn't see him exert much effort, and the car moved forward. A voice came from the crowd: "Really, I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes." To be honest, a few years ago, Bian Jieqiu wouldn't have believed it himself if someone had told him such a thing.

Wasn't it true? Bian Jieqiu still remembered clearly the difficulty of starting the car before each business trip four years ago. After the car had been parked overnight, or for a longer period, it seemed frozen. No matter how hard he cranked it by hand, it wouldn't budge. Even with many people pushing with all their might, the car still wouldn't move. There was no other way but to call all the maintenance workers and movers who were working to help push. Almost every car had to go through this trouble before departure, wasting the work of countless maintenance workers and movers!

Even worse, the car would stop every three miles and break down every five. Once, Bian Jieqiu and more than thirty vehicles from the Chongqing Transportation Office were traveling from Chongqing to Guiyang. Just as they reached the high mountains of Qinggangshao, one car broke down. After waiting and waiting, it was finally repaired. The convoy had just moved a few steps when a tire on the car behind them burst. After it was replaced, Bian Jieqiu's car had only turned two corners when another car's engine broke down. Bian Jieqiu barely managed to tow that car to the station with his own vehicle. This way, they only traveled thirty or forty kilometers a day. Not only was it slow, but it also consumed a lot of gasoline. Cars traveling from Chongqing to Guiyang often ran out of fuel fifty or sixty kilometers away from Guiyang. Because of this, the company had to set up a gas station in Zunyi. Tires usually only lasted one or two thousand kilometers before being scrapped. Some cars broke down on the road so badly that they couldn't be repaired by themselves, so they had to make long-distance calls to the team to send technicians from afar to repair them, which would take ten days or even twenty days.

"How can we make the car run more smoothly, without accidents, and use less fuel? How can we deliver the goods on time without affecting the scheduling?" Bian Jieqiu thought about this day and night. The leaders had talked to him about this many times, and he had exchanged views with everyone many times. But every time it was mentioned, some people frowned. Bian Jieqiu thought of what the captain and the chairman of the trade union had said: why did some cars lose more fuel than others? He pondered this question all day long.

Once, he was on a business trip from Chongqing to Chengdu. The cars still behaved as usual, one breaking down, another refusing to move. When climbing a hill, Bian Jieqiu saw that several cars in front couldn't make it up, stopping after only a few steps. At this moment, he noticed another car in front driving on the mountain road as if it were a flat road. He didn't see it accelerating, and the car went up. Bian Jieqiu stepped on the accelerator and tried to catch up, but he couldn't. He knew that the car in front was driven by someone named Yu Youming. What was Yu Youming's secret to driving so well?

That evening, when they arrived at the station, some drivers chatted after dinner, laughing and having a good time. Bian Jieqiu noticed that Yu Youming was not among them, so he looked everywhere for him and found him under the car. He was lying under the car, busy cleaning it, wiping the grease nipples, and applying grease, his body and face covered in mud.

Bian Jieqiu waited for Yu Youming to finish cleaning up and then went to ask him for details. From the conversation, he learned that Yu Youming carefully checked the car before each departure, to see if the tire pressure was sufficient, whether the chassis screws were loose, and whether the engine had enough oil and water. When stopping on the road, he would check the carburetor's auxiliary cylinder to ensure that the oil level was neither too high nor too low, and he would also correct the platinum gap. Every four or five hundred kilometers, he would wash the rear axle and add grease. Doing this was originally very simple, but some people found it dirty and troublesome, so they just applied a few dabs of oil casually. From the outside, it looked like a lot of oil had been applied, but in reality, very little oil went inside. This way, the grease groove would be blocked by oil scale, sand, and iron filings. Bian Jieqiu recalled the "difficult" efforts of many comrades when applying grease. Each time, they had to exert a lot of effort to remove the grease nipple and add oil. If the screw was rusted and couldn't be removed, they had to soak it in gasoline. This way, it would take two or three hours just to deal with one grease nipple, and it would take a whole day to do them all.

"Washing the car is like taking a bath. People who wash frequently feel refreshed and don't get sick. Lazy people who don't wash often spend more time washing and still don't get clean." Bian Jieqiu followed Yu Youming's method and washed two axles, and it worked immediately. This trip back from Chengdu saved forty-two liters of oil.

Back in Chongqing, he unloaded all ten axles, intending to wash them carefully. In the middle of cleaning, he suddenly remembered a question about the axles that he wanted to ask the technician, so he ran to find him. The technician was standing next to the scrap pile, talking to a comrade. He walked over and saw the technician pointing to a pitted roller bearing disc in his hand, saying: "This is what happens when the adjusting screw on the axle is tightened too much. The car doesn't run fast and wastes fuel. If it's tightened even more, the rollers will burn out and the tires will explode." The technician said, and then picked up another roller bearing disc from the scrap pile. This one was smooth, but it rattled when shaken. The technician said: "This is because the adjusting screw is too loose. The tire will move and wobble, which will not only wear out the tire easily, but also wear down the adjusting screw, so the tire will fly off."

So how can the adjusting screw be tightened just right? Bian Jieqiu remembered that when he washed the axles on the way to Chengdu last time, he had loosened the adjusting screws on two axles a little bit. After loosening them, he felt uneasy, but he drove eight hundred kilometers with trepidation, and nothing happened. On the contrary, the car ran more smoothly than usual.

Should he try loosening all the adjusting screws a little bit? He decided to try it. After tightening the screws, he shook the wheels and saw that they were wobbling, so he unloaded them and re-tightened them until the wheels stopped wobbling. In the meantime, he also thought about the brake clearance, which he had previously made too tight. The automatic band rubbed against the automatic drum fiercely, making the car difficult to move. This time, he made it a little bit larger. Then he checked the oil seal. If this thing was loose, it would leak oil, and if it leaked onto the automatic band, the brakes would not work. If it was too tight, it would easily damage the leather on the oil seal, increasing the car's resistance. After everything was done, he added some grease to each grease nipple, spring pin, and universal joint, and also added black oil to each gear package.

Bian Jieqiu was on another business trip, transporting bridge repair materials to Kangding via Feixian Pass. This section of the road passed through many towering mountain roads, with many bends and uneven surfaces. But Bian Jieqiu didn't feel as tired as before when driving. The engine started with one step on the pedal before departure, and he didn't break down once along the way. Even on the steepest slopes, he didn't need to step on the accelerator hard. When encountering a slightly sloping place, he could even coast without using the accelerator. Bian Jieqiu calculated that he had traveled 1,262 kilometers in seven days on this trip, and none of the machine parts or tires were damaged. He also saved 284 liters of gasoline.

Bian Jieqiu's experience was summarized as the chassis lubrication method. This experience is now widely promoted in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Sichuan, Hangzhou, Qingdao and other places. According to calculations in Beijing and Tianjin, on average, 5% to 10% of gasoline can be saved per hundred kilometers, and one gallon (equivalent to 3.78 liters) of gasoline can run one to two kilometers more. After Sichuan Province promoted this experience in the second half of last year, it saved more than 254,000 liters of gasoline in six months. (Attached picture)

    让汽车跑得轻快省油
    本报记者  傅冬
    广场上站满了人。尽管狂风吹得人睁不开眼睛，可是人们还是站在那里不肯走开。人人都想看一看卞介秋的汽车底盘润滑法的表演：“卞介秋怎么能把汽车弄得那么轻快，省那么多汽油？”正在大伙议论得热闹的时候，一辆大汽车开到了广场。人们顾不上说话了，十几个人一下子就爬上了汽车。这时候，有一个人走到汽车背后，伸出两只手推车子，人们没见他怎么用劲，车子就向前移动了。人群中传出这样的声音：“真的，要不是亲眼看到，说什么我也不信。”说真的，几年以前，要是别人给卞介秋说这样的事，他也是不会相信的。
    不是吗？卞介秋还记得清清楚楚，四年前每次出差前发动车子的困难劲儿。车子过了一夜，或者放的时间久了点，就像冻住了一样，用手把摇，也摇不动。用人推，好多人使了九牛二虎之力，车子还是不动。没办法只有把所有正在干活的保养工、搬运工都叫来推。几乎每个车出发前都要这么折腾一趟，不知耽误了多少保养工、搬运工的工作！
    更糟的是，车子上了路，三里一停，五里一坏。卞介秋有一次和重庆运输处的三十多辆车一起由重庆去贵阳。刚走到青杠哨的高山上面，一个车出毛病了，左等右等好容易修好了，大队车子刚走了几步，后面一个车子的轮胎破了，刚换好了，卞介秋的车子才转了两个弯，又有一辆车子引擎打烂了。卞介秋用自己的车子好不容易才把那部车子拖到了站。这样一天才走了三、四十公里路。光慢不说，汽油还耗费得厉害，车子从重庆到贵阳，常常走到离贵阳五、六十公里的地方就没油了。为这事，公司不得不在遵义设了个加油站。轮胎一般只走一、二千公里就报废了。有的车在路上坏的实在自己没法修，只好打长途电话给队部派技工老远地赶来修，这样一来，得耽搁十几天甚至二十几天功夫。
    “怎么就能把车子弄得灵活一点，不出事、少用油？怎么能准时把货物送到，不影响货物的调度？”卞介秋一天到晚想这件事，领导同志为这事和他谈过好多次话，他也和大伙交换过不少次意见。可是每次一提起来，有的人就皱眉头。卞介秋想到队长和工会主席说的话，为什么有的车亏油多，有的车亏油少呢？他成天思索这个问题。
    有一次出差是从重庆去成都。几辆汽车一路上仍像往常一样，一会儿这个车机件坏了，一会儿那个车不动了。上山爬坡了，卞介秋看见前面几辆车怎么也爬不上去，车子走几步停一下。这时他又注意到前面另一辆车子走在山路上像在平道上一样，没见他加油，车子就上去了。卞介秋把油门加大紧跟着追，也追不上。他知道前面那辆车是一个叫余幼明的在开，余幼明有什么窍门能把车开得那么好？
    晚上到站了。有的驾驶员吃完饭，就闲谈起来了，大家又说又笑，好不热闹。卞介秋注意到人群中没有余幼明，就到处去找，结果在汽车下面找到了。他正躺在车下忙着收拾车子，擦黄油咀子、上黄油，满身满脸弄的是泥。
    卞介秋等余幼明收拾完，就去向他了解个究竟。从谈话里他知道余幼明每次出发前，都要仔仔细细检查一遍车子，看看轮胎的汽压够不够，底盘的螺丝松不松，引擎的机油和水足不足？路上停车，就检查化油器的副筒，使油不过高过低，还校正白金间隙。走上四、五百公里，他就洗一次后轮轴，加一次黄油。这样做本来很简单，可是，有些人嫌脏嫌麻烦，就马马虎虎点几下油，从外表上看油淋淋地像是上了好多油，实际上里面没进去什么油。这样，黄油槽就被油垢、灰沙和铁沫堵得死死的。卞介秋回忆起许多同志上黄油的“艰苦”劲儿，每次都得费好大的劲才能把黄油咀拆下来加上油。碰到螺丝生了锈，拆不下来，还得用汽油浸。这样光弄一个黄油咀就得花二、三个钟头，全弄一遍要花一天功夫。
    “洗刷车子也像人洗澡一样，人勤洗澡浑身痛快不生病。懒人不常洗澡，洗一次花的时间多还洗不干净。”卞介秋照余幼明的法儿洗了二个轮轴，马上见效，这一趟从成都回来，就省了四十二公升油。
    回到重庆，他把十个轮轴都卸下来，打算仔仔细细洗刷一遍。正收拾中间，他忽然想起轮轴上有个问题要问技术员，就跑去找。技术员正站在废料堆旁和一个同志谈话。他走过去，看见技术员指着手里拿的一个尽是坑坑凹凹的轮轴弹子盘说：“轮轴上的调整螺丝上紧了就成这样子，车走不快，还费油。如果再上的紧一点，弹子烧坏，轮胎就要放炮。”技术员说着，又从废料堆里抓起一个轮轴弹子盘，这个弹子盘倒是光溜溜的，可是一摇起来哗啦啦直响。技术员说：“这是调整螺丝上得过松的缘故，轮胎就活动、摇摆，不但容易磨坏轮胎，而且容易把调整螺丝磨掉，这样轮胎就飞了。”
    那么怎样就能把调整螺丝上得刚合适？卞介秋想起上次去成都路上洗轮轴的时候，他曾把两个轮轴的调整螺丝弄松过一点，上松以后，心里直嘀咕，可是这样提心吊胆走了八百公里，并没出事，车子反倒比平时走得欢。
    要不要试着把所有的调整螺丝都上松一点？他决定试一下。螺丝上好以后，他扳了扳轮子，看见轮子直晃摇，他就又卸下来重上，一直弄到轮子不再摇摆。在这中间，他又想起刹车的间隙，以前弄得太紧，自动带自动鼓磨擦得厉害，车子走不动，这次他弄得稍稍大了点。接着他又检查了一下护油圈，这玩意松了要漏油，漏到自动带上刹车不灵，紧了又容易把护油圈上的牛皮弄烂，增加车子的阻力。一切弄妥以后，他给各个黄油咀、钢板肖子和十字接头上了些黄油，另外又给各个牙包上了黑油。
    卞介秋又出差了，到飞仙关给康藏公路运送修桥的材料。这一段路要经过许多高入云霄的山路，弯子多，路面又不平。可是卞介秋开起车来没有先前那样吃力了，出发前一踩马达就着火，一路没抛过一次锚。上再陡的坡，也不要加大油门。碰到有点斜坡的地方，还可以滑行，不用开油门。卞介秋算了算，这一趟出去七天走了1，262公里，机件轮胎一点没坏，还节约了284公升酒精。
    卞介秋的这套经验，被总结成为底盘润滑法，这个经验，现在已经在北京、天津、上海、沈阳、四川、杭州、青岛等地普遍推广。据北京、天津两处的计算，平均每百公里就能节约5％至10％的汽油，每加仑（合3.78公升）汽油多跑一至二公里路。四川省去年下半年推广这个经验以后，六个月功夫就节省了二十五万四千多公升汽油。（附图片）
