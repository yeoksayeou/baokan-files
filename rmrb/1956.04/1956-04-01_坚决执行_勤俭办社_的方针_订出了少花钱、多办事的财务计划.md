    Resolutely Implement the Policy of "Running the Cooperative Diligently and Thriftily"
    Formulate a Financial Plan to Spend Less and Accomplish More
    To the Editor:
    The Qianjin Tenth Agricultural Production Cooperative (advanced form) of Liuji Township, Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, was established last winter. At that time, some of the cooperative's staff members did not realize the importance of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily." Therefore, they planned to buy excessive amounts of commercial fertilizers and agricultural machinery, and also to build cement toilets... In February of this year, someone even suggested buying radios and loudspeakers, arguing that music could be broadcast to the members while they were working in the fields. This suggestion was opposed by all the poor peasant committee members of the cooperative's management committee, but the middle peasant committee members and some young people believed that not buying these things meant "lacking the style of socialism." The two sides debated endlessly without reaching a conclusion.
    Soon, some cooperative members learned about this and unanimously disagreed with the purchase of radios and loudspeakers, and criticized the management committee. Yao Haishan (a Communist Party member), the director of the cooperative, decided to have each team discuss the issue. As a result, more than 90% of the members disagreed with the purchase of radios and loudspeakers, and also suggested that major expenditures within the cooperative should be discussed by the members.
    The management committee accepted this suggestion and organized each team to discuss this year's financial plan. As a result of the discussions, inappropriate expenditures in the plan were revised. For example, the original plan decided to buy 14,000 yuan worth of commercial fertilizer, which has now been reduced to 9,500 yuan; the fertilizer shortage will be replaced by natural fertilizer, with the increase in pond mud alone reaching 270,000 dan, increasing from the original 368 dan per mu to 638 dan per mu. By early March, this fertilizer accumulation plan had been basically completed, with all the old ponds and cellars being dug out and a layer of pond mud being generally added to the wheat fields. For another example, the original plan was to build toilets with cement, but now it has been changed to mixing lime, and the materials from many small manure pits originally owned by the members have been concentrated, saving bricks, stones, and cement. In this way, the entire cooperative saved nearly 20,000 yuan in investment. The members generally reflected: Fortunately, we made the decision ourselves, so that we could formulate a plan to spend less and accomplish more!

### 坚决执行“勤俭办社”的方针  订出了少花钱、多办事的财务计划

    坚决执行“勤俭办社”的方针
    订出了少花钱、多办事的财务计划编辑同志：
    湖北新洲县刘集乡前进第十农业生产合作社（高级形式的）是去年冬天成立的。当时社里有一部分工作人员没有体会到“勤俭办社”的重要性，因而计划要买过多的商品肥料和药械，还要修建水泥厕所……。今年二月间，有人还提议买收音机和扩音机，理由是社员在田野上生产的时候可以放送音乐。这个意见遭到合作社管理委员会所有贫农委员的反对，但是中农委员和一些年青人却认为不买这些东西就是“没有社会主义的气派”。双方争论不休，没有得到结果。
    不久，一部分社员知道了这件事，一致不同意购买收音机和扩音器，并且向管理委员会提出批评。社主任姚海山（共产党员）就决定让各队讨论这个问题。结果，90％以上的社员不同意购买收音机和扩音器，同时还提出社内重大开支应该由社员讨论的意见。
    管理委员会接受了这个意见，就组织各队讨论今年的财务计划。讨论结果，计划中开支不当的部分都已作了修改。像原来计划中决定买一万四千元钱的商品肥料，现在减少到九千五百元；所缺的肥料用自然肥料来代替，仅塘泥一项就增加了27万担，由原来每亩368担增到638担。到三月上旬，这个积肥计划已经基本上完成了，所有陈塘老窖都被挖掘一空，麦地上普遍增添了塘泥一层。又如，原来计划用水泥修厕所，现在改用石灰拌合，又把社员原有的许多小粪窖的材料集中起来，节省了砖、石头和水泥。这样全社节省了将近两万元的投资。社员普遍反映：幸亏我们作了主，才能订出少花钱、多办事的计划！
