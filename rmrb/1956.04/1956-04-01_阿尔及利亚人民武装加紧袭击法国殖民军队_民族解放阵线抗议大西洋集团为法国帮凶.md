Xinhua News Agency, March 31st -- According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 30th: Newspapers report that fierce fighting is currently taking place between Constantine and El Milia in Algeria.

    "Paris Radical News" stated that 103 Algerian insurgents were killed on March 29th alone. The newspaper emphasized that in response to the French forces' operations, Algerian armed units are destroying bridges and French farms, and attacking military transports and strongholds. They destroyed more bridges and farms in the past two days than in the entire previous week. On March 29th, 200 insurgents equipped with submachine guns attacked a military transport of the 3rd Colonial Infantry Regiment. Several soldiers and one officer were killed.

    According to newspaper reports, French Minister Delegate for Algerian Affairs, Lacoste, confirmed at a press conference on the 29th that the French government is continuously dispatching more troops to Algeria. At the same time, French forces are increasingly using aircraft in their battles against Algerian insurgents.

Xinhua News Agency, March 31st -- New York Dispatch: The representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, Hocine Aït Ahmed, sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 30th, protesting the North Atlantic Group's support for France's suppression of the Algerian people. The telegram stated: "The National Liberation Front vehemently condemns the new colonialist formula of 'Algeria being an indivisible part of the Atlantic region,' which provides the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with a basis for intervention."

    The telegram accused the use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and French troops within this military bloc to oppose peace-loving Algeria, and accused "North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries occupying prominent positions in the Security Council" of delivering helicopters to France to use against the Algerian people. The telegram stated that this "is inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations."

    The telegram pointed out that France has already deployed 300,000 troops in the Algerian colonial war. The telegram also stated: "Every day, reinforcements arrive in Algeria by sea or by large-scale air transport from France, West Africa, and South Vietnam. Two mechanized divisions under the command of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe have also been deployed from Germany."

    民族解放阵线抗议大西洋集团为法国帮凶
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社巴黎三十日讯：据报纸报道，目前在阿尔及利亚的君士坦丁和阿兰之间的一个地方，正在进行着激烈的战斗。
      “巴黎激进新闻”说，仅在三月二十九日一天，就有一百零三个阿尔及利亚起义者被杀。这家报纸着重指出，为了回答法国部队的作战行动，阿尔及利亚人的武装队伍正在毁坏桥梁和法国人的农庄，并且袭击军事运输和据点。在过去两天中，他们毁坏的桥梁和农庄比整个上星期毁坏的都要多。在三月二十九日，两百个配备着手提机关枪的起义者袭击了第三殖民步兵团的军事运输。几个士兵和一个军官被击毙。
    据报纸消息，法国阿尔及利亚事务特任部长拉戈斯特二十九日在记者招待会上证实，法国政府正在不断增派军队到阿尔及利亚去。同时，法国部队在对付阿尔及利亚起义者的战斗中，越来越经常地使用飞机。
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表侯赛尼·艾特·艾哈迈德三十日打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德抗议北大西洋集团支持法国镇压阿尔及利亚人民。电报说：“民族解放阵线猛烈谴责所谓‘阿尔及利亚是大西洋区不可分割的一个部分’这个殖民主义的新公式，这给予北大西洋公约组织以进行干涉的根据。”
    电报指责利用北大西洋公约组织和这个军事集团中的法国军队来反对爱好和平的阿尔及利亚，并且指责在“安全理事会中占显著地位的北大西洋公约组织国家”把直升飞机运交法国来对付阿尔及利亚人民。电报说，这“都是不符合联合国的宗旨和原则的”。
    电报指出，法国已经在阿尔及利亚殖民战争中投入了三十万军队。电报还说：“每天都有增援军队从法国，西非和南越经海路或由大规模空运到达阿尔及利亚。还有两个在北大西洋公约组织总司令部指挥下的机械化师已经从德国开出。”
