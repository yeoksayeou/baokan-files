Marching into the Primeval Forest
A Letter from Lumberjacks of the Hongqiao Mountain Forest Farm in Sichuan

Dear Editor Comrades:

We are a group of lumberjacks now working in the primeval forests of Hongqiao Mountain in northwestern Sichuan. This is a wonderful place! The endless mountains and ridges of forest truly resemble a green ocean; on the cliffs and precipices of high mountains and deep valleys, densely packed ancient trees—hemlock, fir, spruce, red birch, white birch, poplar, etc.—stand, and in many places, there are no roads at all. In the forest, countless camellias, golden roses, and wild roses emit a charming fragrance, flocks of hazel grouse and pheasants sing melodiously, and teams of antelopes, mountain horses, and rock mules gallop swiftly. The joyful songs of us forestry workers, happy laughter, the tense shouts of "Heave-ho!", and the booming sound of falling trees form a symphony of labor that vibrates the entire valley like thunder.

Working here are forestry workers of Han, Qiang, Hui, and Tibetan ethnicities. Among us, many touching stories of ethnic friendship have emerged. Last year, 302 Lumber Camp Tibetan worker Norzhen was gathering timber in a mountain gully when he saw a diseased and rotten tree swaying precariously in the wind, threatening the safety of the workers below. He immediately sought the consent of the leading comrades and, along with several Han workers, went up to cut it down. Just as the tree was about to be sawed through, a gust of wind suddenly blew through the forest, changing the direction of the falling tree. He told the Han workers to run aside, and used his body to block the nearly falling tree. In this way, the Han workers were safe, but he was injured in the leg and fainted. After his comrades rescued and woke him up, his first words were: "Are all the comrades safe!" Another time, a young Qiang man, Xiao Ashen, went to fell trees in the forest with Han worker Chen Linyu. The wind broke a dead tree, which was about to hit Ashen on the head. Chen Linyu risked danger to drag Ashen away, but he himself was hit and vomited blood. While he was recuperating, workers of all ethnicities came to visit him, and some even secretly put candy, fritillary bulbs, and cordyceps into his pockets.

In this deep mountain forest at an altitude of four thousand meters, goose-feather snow still flies in April and May, and glittering icicles hang everywhere on the rocks and treetops. When we work, we are often covered in white snow, with ice silk hanging from our eyebrows, and the yak-hair leggings and hemp-rope straw sandals on our feet are covered with a layer of ice, making a rustling sound as we walk. However, we are always full of energy, and beads of sweat constantly stream down our foreheads. Some comrades have even composed songs to sing about themselves: "We are lumberjacks, our hands are omnipotent…; for the industrialization of the motherland, we are willing to dedicate our youth to the forest industry." Our life is hard, but it is also happy! We use diseased and rotten wood to build wooden sheds, and fir bark to build houses. We dig fire kangs underground. How warm are the homes of us lumberjacks! Our study notebooks are bound with red birch bark. When winter ice and snow seal the mountains and the forest turns into a silver ocean, we sit by the stove and discuss "what is happiness?" Comrade Zhang Anjun stood up and said: "Our felling timber here today, enables millions of people to sit in warm houses drinking hot tea, and this is our happiness!" Every Sunday evening, when the forest draws the curtain of night, the entertainment party begins: Tibetan youths stomp their feet, and Qiang youths wave their sleeves, dancing one after another. Joyful songs drive away fatigue and frighten away the mountain wolves.

For more than three years, we have bravely fought in the forest. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and the close unity of workers of all ethnic groups, we have continuously overcome difficulties and ensured the completion of production tasks. We have successively opened up ten forest areas including Miaruo, Shiba Turns, Dalang Dam, Maermi, Dasier, Jiujia Shed, and Suoluo Gully, providing more than 1,000 kilometers of railway sleepers for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, as well as timber for bridges on the South Chongqing Highway and the Mu-Shi Highway, and timber for civil construction, ships, pit props, and utility poles in the vast Southwest region. This March, we opened up the huge Heishui Forest Area, which is expected to be able to be harvested for more than twenty-five years. Our lives are gradually improving. In the Miaruo Forest Area, hundreds of worker family dormitories have been built, forming a forestry town. Miaruo now has a People's Bank, a national trade company, a market, a worker's canteen, a mobile cinema, and a bathhouse. All daily necessities are available.

Our logging operations are gradually advancing on the road to mechanization. Four river extraction machines and two log-stacking machines have been installed in the timber yards along the banks of the Wenchuan, Minjiang, Laomukong, and Jiulidi rivers; the Sichuan Plywood Factory and the Lumber Mill have been fully mechanized; utility poles have formed a forest in Jiulidi, electric wires are like spider webs, and huge cranes are transporting timber. Therefore, the amount of timber we cut down in one year has exceeded more than nine times the highest amount of timber felled in one year during the reactionary ruling era.

Editor Comrades, we have a lot to say to the people of the motherland. However, it is late, the campfire is about to go out, so I will stop here! Shake hands with you.

### 向原始森林进军  四川红荞山林场伐木工人的来信

    向原始森林进军
    四川红荞山林场伐木工人的来信亲爱的编辑同志：
    我们是一群伐木工人，现在正在四川西北部红荞山的原始森林里工作着。我们这里是一个美好的地方！山山不断、岭岭相连的森林，一望无边地真像一片绿色的海洋；在高山深谷的悬崖绝壁上，密密麻麻地排列着千百年的大树——铁杉、冷杉、云杉、赤桦、白桦、白杨等，很多地方连路都没有。在森林中，无数山茶花、金山蔷薇、野玫瑰散发着迷人的清香，成群的贝母鸡和山雉在婉啭地歌唱，一队队羚羊、山马、岩骡在飞驰般地奔跑。我们林业工人欢乐的歌声，愉快的笑声，紧张的嗨唷声和大树倒下来的轰隆声，组成了一支劳动的交响乐，像春雷似地震动了整个山谷。
    在我们这里工作的，有汉族、羌族、回族和藏族的林业工人们。在我们中间，出现了很多动人的表现了民族友谊的事迹。去年302伐木场藏族工人诺尔仁在山沟里集材的时候，看到有一棵病腐木被风吹得东摇西摆，威胁着下面工人的安全，立刻征求领导同志的同意后和几个汉族工人上去把它砍掉。树快锯断时，突然林子里刮起一阵风，使倒树的方向变了。他一面叫汉族工人跑开，一面用自己的身子去挡住那棵快倒的树。这样，汉族工人都得到了安全，他却被打伤一支腿，昏了过去。同志们把他救醒以后，他第一句话就问：“同志们都安全吧！”又一次，一个羌族青年小阿申，和汉族工人陈林宇到林中去伐树。风吹断了一棵枯树，正向阿申头上打来。陈林宇冒着危险把阿申拖开，但是自己却被打得吐了血。在他养伤的时候，各族的工人兄弟都来慰问他，有的还悄悄地把糖果、贝母、虫草，装在他的衣袋里。
    在这海拔四千公尺的深山丛林里，四、五月间还飞着鹅毛大雪，山岩上、树梢间到处挂着亮晶晶的冰凌柱子。我们工作的时候，常常是身披着白雪，眉毛上挂着冰丝，脚上的牛毛裹腿和麻绳草鞋结着一层冰，走起路来擦擦响。但是，我们始终是精力充沛地工作着，额上的汗珠不断地淌下来。有的同志还编起歌曲来歌唱自己：“我们是伐木工人，我们的双手万能……；为了祖国工业化，愿为森林工业献出青春。”我们的生活是艰苦的，但是也是愉快的！我们用病朽木修起了木棚，用杉木皮盖起了房子，在地下打下火炕，伐木工人的家多温暖啊！我们的学习本是用赤桦树皮订成的。当冬季冰雪封山，森林变成了银色的海洋的时候，我们坐在火炉边讨论着“什么叫幸福”？张安郡同志站起来说：“我们今天在这里伐木，使千千万万个人可以坐在温暖的房子里喝着热茶，这就是我们的幸福！”每逢星期日的黄昏，森林拉开夜幕的时候，文娱晚会就开始了：藏族青年蹬着脚，羌族青年挥着袖子，一个接一个地跳起舞了。欢愉的歌声赶走了疲劳，惊走了山狼。
    三年多来，我们勇敢地战斗在森林里，由于党的领导和各族工人的紧密团结，我们不断战胜了困难，保证完成了生产任务。我们先后开辟了米亚罗、十八拐、大郎坝、麻尔咪、打色尔、九架棚、梭罗沟等十个林区，供给了成渝铁路、宝成铁路一千多公里的铁道枕木，供给了渝南公路、沐石公路桥梁和西南广大地区的土木建设用材和船只、坑木、电杆的用材。今年三月我们又开辟巨大的黑水林区——这个林区预计可以采伐二十五年以上。我们的生活在逐步提高，在米亚罗林区已修起了几百幢工人家属宿舍，形成了林业集镇。米亚罗已经有了人民银行，民族贸易公司，市场，工人食堂，流动电影院，澡堂，日常生活必需品应有尽有。
    我们的伐木操作工作正逐步在机械化道路上前进。在汶川、岷江、老母孔和九里堤河畔贮木场已经安装了四部出河机和两部归楞机；四川胶合成板厂、制材场已经全部机械化；九里畔已经电杆成林，电线像蜘蛛网，巨大的起重机在起运着木材。因此，我们一年砍伐的木材，已经超过反动统治时代一年伐木最高数量的九倍多。
    编辑同志，我们有很多话要向祖国人民说。可是，夜已深了，营火将熄了，就写到这里为止吧！和你们握手。
