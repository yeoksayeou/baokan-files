In the spring fields of Sichuan, waves of wheat and shimmering rapeseed flowers paint a picture of a bountiful harvest for the spring crops. Due to the widespread implementation of dense planting of rapeseed and strip sowing of wheat in the western Sichuan plain, along with the use of improved varieties and increased topdressing, rapeseed production is expected to increase by 10% and wheat production by 15%. In the 7,800 mu of rapeseed and wheat fields at the foot of Mount Emei, a general increase of 15% in production is expected this year. In Rong County, the 35,000 mu of wheat fields are expected to yield an average increase of 50 jin per mu compared to last year, marking the first good harvest after collectivization.

    峨嵋山下油菜小麦可望增产
    春天的四川原野，到处是麦穗的波浪，油菜花的闪光，田间春季作物呈现一片丰收景象。川西平原由于广泛实行油菜密植和小麦条播，选用良种和增施追肥，预计油菜可增产10％，小麦增产15％。峨嵋山下的七千八百亩油菜、小麦今年普遍增产一成半。荣县三万五千亩小麦，每亩产量平均可比去年提高五十斤，这是合作化后的第一个好收成。（本报驻成都记者）
