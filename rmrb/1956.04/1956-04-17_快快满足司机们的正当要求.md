Quickly Fulfill the Legitimate Demands of Drivers
By our reporter Chen Ji

The Changchun Locomotive Depot fulfilled its summer quota of hauling 2,700 tons three months ahead of schedule. However, the drivers encountered a new problem: can they consistently haul more and run better in the future? To consistently haul more and run better, precise and comprehensive transportation organization is essential.

The problem is that the current transportation organization is very poor. The drivers are very dissatisfied and say: sometimes they want us to haul more, sometimes less; this locomotive is overloaded, that locomotive runs empty; the up train is overloaded with 2,700 tons, while the down train only hauls 1,100 tons. In January and February, the Changchun Railway Sub-bureau had empty locomotives running over 22,000 kilometers, accounting for 6.3% of the total locomotive mileage. Accidents occur constantly alongside overloading. In early March, one locomotive was a few minutes late, causing eight trains to be unable to turn around on time. All these shortcomings hinder the improvement of overloading quality.

In order to eliminate these shortcomings, the four chartered locomotive teams led by Li Shaoqiang and others proposed a daily output target of one million ton-kilometers. The so-called daily output of one million ton-kilometers means that each locomotive hauls an average of one ton of goods for one million kilometers per day. Achieving this target would allow us to consistently haul more and run better, ensuring transportation quality.

To achieve the target of one million ton-kilometers per day, not only must the drivers be able to haul more and run faster, but also all railway departments must cooperate with each other to improve together. Currently, the lack of good collaboration and coordination between various railway bureaus is a serious problem. Some units, in order to load and unload more on their own, delay sending out vehicles. Some units are afraid of not completing their own targets and are unwilling to assemble more trains or attach more cars. Because vehicles cannot arrive in time, some locomotives wait for seven or eight hours without being able to pull a train. Because the number of vehicles assembled and attached varies from time to time, the driver's ability to consistently overload cannot be guaranteed. Almost no one interferes with these departmentalism practices. The Ministry of Railways should promptly formulate measures to comprehensively examine and criticize departmentalism thinking and behavior in a swift and decisive manner.

To achieve the target of one million ton-kilometers per day, it is also necessary to comprehensively improve the work of all units. If one unit falls behind, the realization of this target cannot be guaranteed. It has now been discovered that dispatching and station technical operations are both lagging behind and cannot guarantee more hauling and faster running. Vehicles remain at the station for too long, which cannot accelerate turnover. Some vehicles are left at the station and no one cares about them for more than ten days. Last year, at the Siping Station, the average time each car spent waiting for departure, delivery, pickup, and disassembly accounted for about 11% of the average operating time of a car. Some people say that the vast majority of waiting time is illegal. The strange thing is that this illegal thing is still retained today. Some units have improper dispatching, cannot grasp the traffic flow situation, and the dispatching plan is not practical for a long time, resulting in extremely unbalanced train operation. These backward phenomena hinder more hauling and faster running.

In order to ensure the realization of the one million ton-kilometers per day target, some outdated regulations and outdated operating times should also be revised in a timely manner, and the equipment of some stations should be appropriately renovated. Recently, passenger trains are still running according to winter schedules, which will affect the fast running of freight trains. Such problems should be resolved immediately. Also, the track length of some stations is not sufficient to accommodate overly long overloaded trains, and this should also be resolved by improving dispatching work.

Now the masses are leaping forward and productivity is developing. The problem facing the railway leadership is to seize the time and quickly solve the new problems exposed in hauling more and running faster.

    快快满足司机们的正当要求
    本报记者　陈迹
    长春机务段提前三个月实现了牵引两千七百吨的夏季定额。但是，司机们碰到一个新问题：今后能不能经常地拉得多跑得好呢？要能经常地拉得多跑得好，就必须有精密的完善的运输组织工作。
    糟糕的是目前运输组织工作很坏。司机们很不满意地说：一会要多拉，一会又要少拉；这台机车超轴，那台机车空跑；上行超轴两千七百吨，下行只拉一千一百吨。长春铁路分局在一、二两月份，空跑的单机走了二万二千多公里，占全部机车走行公里的6.3％。在超轴的同时，不断发生事故。三月初有一台机车走慢了几分钟，使得八列列车不能按时周转。这种种缺点，都妨碍着超轴质量的提高。
    为了消除这些缺点，李绍强等领导的四个包车组提出日产百万吨公里的指标。所谓日产百万吨公里，就是每台机车平均每天拉一吨重的东西走行一百万公里。实现了这个指标，就能经常地拉得多跑得好，保证运输质量。
    要实现日产百万吨公里的指标，不但要司机能够多拉快跑，而且要铁路各个部门互相协作共同提高。目前，各个铁路局之间不能很好的协作配合的情况是严重的。有些单位为了自己多装车，多卸车，迟迟不送出车辆。有的单位害怕本单位指标完不成，不愿多编车，不肯多挂车。因为车辆不能及时到达，有些机车等待了七八小时，还拉不着车。因为编挂的车辆时多时少，不能经常保证司机的超轴。对于这些本位主义的做法，几乎无人干涉。铁道部应该及时订出办法来，雷厉风行地全面检查和批判本位主义的思想行为。
    要实现日产百万吨公里的指标，还必须全面提高各个单位的工作。一个单位落后了，就不能保证这个指标的实现。现在已经发现调度指挥工作和车站技术作业都很落后，不能保证多拉快跑。车辆停留在车站的时间过长，不能加快周转。有些车辆放在车站，过了十来天，还无人过问。去年一年，四平车站平均每辆车待发、待送、待取和待解体的时间，竟占一辆车平均作业时间的11％左右。有人说，绝大部分的等待时间是非法的。奇怪的是这种非法的东西，今天依然保留。有些单位调度指挥不当，车流情况不能掌握，调度计划长期不切合实际，列车运行极不平衡。这些落后现象，都阻碍着多拉快跑。
    为了保证日产百万吨公里指标的实现，还应该及时修改若干陈旧的规定和过时的运行时间，适当改造一些车站的设备。最近客车仍然按照冬季时间运行，这就会影响货车快跑，这样的问题是应该即速解决的。还有些车站的股道长度不够，不能容纳过长的超轴列车，也应该通过改善指挥工作加以解决。
    现在群众在跃进，生产力在发展，摆在铁路领导部门面前的问题，是抓紧时间，赶快解决在多拉快跑中所暴露出来的新的问题。
