How to Set Accurate Quotas
    Yú Xǐbīn

    A major problem currently encountered by agricultural production cooperatives in implementing work quotas is the difficulty in setting accurate work quotas and ensuring the quality of work. The Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gucheng Township, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, has initially solved this problem. After the preparatory work for farming was completed, the cooperative promptly summarized its experience in implementing work quotas during this period. They believe that to set relatively accurate work quotas, it is necessary to focus on the following two points:

    (1) Implement seasonal and phased quotas. Agricultural production is greatly influenced by regional, seasonal, and temporal factors, which are directly related to the accuracy of quotas. In cooperatives with little experience in setting quotas, they should initially focus on doing a good job of setting quotas for each small segment of agricultural work in one season. This is because determining quotas is a relatively detailed task, and it is only through careful study that they can be set relatively accurately. If, without experience, one tries to determine all kinds of quotas for the whole year at once, it is not easy to set them accurately. For example, the Qianjin Cooperative had more than a dozen major agricultural tasks in the preparatory work for farming. Because the research was not detailed enough, the quotas for several kinds of agricultural tasks had to be changed during the implementation process, causing the leading cadres to be passive in their work, and the members lost confidence in the implementation of work quotas. When setting quotas for well-digging, the cooperative staff had no experience at all, and only heard that in Xinbao Village it was "sixteen points for half a meter..." so they contracted according to this quota. As a result, each member earned more than twenty points a day; some even earned an average of twenty-eight points a day. As a result, the groom (who earned nine points a day) also proposed not to feed the horses and asked to go digging wells. Therefore, when the cooperative begins to implement work quotas, it can adopt the method of setting seasonal and phased quotas according to the progress of agricultural work, and gradually formulate annual work quotas. At the same time, in the process of formulating work quotas, the quota experience of other cooperatives should not be copied rigidly, but must be applied according to the actual situation of the cooperative. Only in this way can the work quotas be set more accurately.

    (2) For agricultural work that is not certain, quotas should be determined after on-site experiments. The Qianjin Cooperative changed the quota for digging sod four times. At first, it was stipulated that one laborer should dig fifteen pieces a day. On the third day, it was changed to twenty-five pieces. On the fourth day, someone dug more than sixty pieces, so it was changed to thirty-five pieces. Later, it was seen that this quota was still not good, and it was changed to be calculated by the cart. As a result, the members were afraid of further changes, and they did not work harder even if they had the strength to do so. Accepting this lesson, they plan to estimate a "rough number" for any work that they are not sure about in the future, and organize fair members with medium normal labor ability to conduct experiments before determining the quota.

    In order to ensure the quality of work, the cooperative must put forward quality requirements when formulating quotas. The experience of the Qianjin Cooperative is: (1) The quality requirements of the quota should be clear and specific, and should not be general. The quota for digging sod in this cooperative originally only specified the quantity, but did not determine the size of the sod pieces. As a result, the sizes were different, with some pieces weighing more than fifty catties and others only the size of a water scoop. (2) Establish a quality inspection and acceptance system. The Qianjin Cooperative stipulates that the production team leader or group leader should be responsible for acceptance before and after work every day. Those who do not meet the quality requirements should be given criticism, deductions, rework, demerits and other punishments according to different situations.

    After summarizing the experience of implementing work quotas in the previous stage, the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative established a quota management committee (consisting of the cooperative director, production team leader, and chief accountant) and a quota team (consisting of the production team leader, group leader, and bookkeeper) to strengthen the leadership of this work and be responsible for the specific organization and leadership of quotas. They stipulate that the quota management committee should formulate the quotas about ten days before the beginning of each agricultural season, so as to avoid temporary scrambling and inaccurate quotas. If it is found that the quota is unreasonable during implementation, the production team leader or quota team has no right to modify it. The right to modify belongs to the cooperative's management committee. Each quota team should promptly report the implementation of the quota to the quota committee for research in order to improve the quota work.

    怎样才能把定额定得准确
    于喜滨
    目前农业生产合作社在推行工作定额过程中遇到的一个主要问题，是不容易把工作定额定得准确和不容易保证工作质量。黑龙江省克山县古城乡前进农业生产合作社已经初步解决了这个问题。这个社在备耕工作告一段落后，及时地总结了这一段实行工作定额的经验。他们认为要把工作定额定得比较准确，必须抓住下面两点：
    （一）实行按季分段定额。农业生产受地域性、季节性、时间性的影响很大，这和定额准不准有直接关系。在定额经验很少的合作社，开始应该着重搞好一个季节的各小段的农活定额，因为确定定额是一件比较细致的工作，只有经过周密研究，才能定得比较准确。如果在没有经验的时候，就想一下子把全年的各种定额确定出来，那是不容易定得准确的。比如前进社在备耕工作中比较主要的农活有十几种，因为研究的不细，有好几种农活的定额在执行当中不得不加以改变，造成领导干部工作被动，社员对实行工作定额失去信心。在制定打井定额时候，社的工作人员本来没经验，只是听说新保村“打半米十六分……”，就按着这个定额包下去。结果每个社员一天挣二十多分；甚至每天平均挣二十八分。这样一来，饲养员（每天挣九分）也提出来不喂马了，要求去打井。因此，合作社在开始实行工作定额的时候，可以根据农活的进度，采用按季分段定额办法，逐步制定全年的工作定额。同时在制定工作定额的过程中，对别的合作社的定额经验，也不能硬搬硬套，必须根据本社的实际情况来运用，只有这样，才能把工作定额定得比较准确。
    （二）对没有把握的农活应当进行实地试验以后再确定定额。前进社挖草皮土的定额先后变了四次。开始规定一个劳力一天挖十五块，第三天改到二十五块，第四天有人挖了六十多块，于是又改到三十五块，后来一看这个定额还不行，又改成按车计算。这样一来，社员因为怕再变动，有力量多干也不多干了。接受这个教训，他们准备今后凡是遇到心里没底的活计，就先估计个“概数”，组织公道的有中常劳动能力的社员试验以后，再确定定额。
    为了保证工作质量，合作社在制定定额的时候，必须提出质量要求。前进社的经验是：（一）定额的质量要求明确具体，不能笼统。这个社规定的挖草皮土的定额，原来只规定了数量，没确定草皮土块大小，结果大小不一，大的一块五十斤以上，小的一块只有水瓢大。（二）建立质量检查验收制度。前进社规定每天收工前后，要由生产队长或组长负责验收，对不合质量要求的，应当分别情况给予批评、扣分、返工、记过等处分。
    前进农业生产合作社总结了前一阶段实行工作定额的经验以后，为了加强对这一工作的领导，专门成立了定额管理委员会（社主任、生产队长、总会计参加）和定额小组（生产队长、组长、记账员参加），负责定额的具体组织领导工作。他们规定在每一个农业季节开始的前十天左右，定额管理委员会就要把定额制定出来，以免临时乱抓，定得不准确。在贯彻执行中如果发现定额不合理，生产队长或定额小组都无权修改，修改的权利属于社的管委会。各定额小组应及时向上反映定额执行情况，供定额委员会研究，以便改进定额工作。
