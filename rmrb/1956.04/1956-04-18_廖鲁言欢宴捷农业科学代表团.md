Xinhua News Agency, April 17th: Minister of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, Liao Luyan, held a banquet this evening to welcome the Czechoslovak Agricultural Science Delegation headed by K. Frlček.

    In his welcoming speech, Liao Luyan pointed out that China's agricultural collectivization movement is currently developing on an unprecedented scale, requiring us to provide farmers with more guidance in science and technology. We have not done enough in this regard. This visit of the Czechoslovak Agricultural Science Delegation to various parts of China will certainly provide many valuable suggestions to help us move forward.

    Frlček said in his speech that the Czechoslovak people are closely and joyfully paying attention to how China is carrying out the powerful industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture with great interest and excitement. The workers of advanced Czechoslovak industry will do everything possible to correctly complete the supply of machinery and equipment necessary for Chinese industry and agriculture.

    Subsequently, the Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Gregor, and Deputy Minister of Forestry, Luo Yuchuan, as well as scientists from China and Czechoslovakia, delivered speeches.

    据新华社17日讯　中华人民共和国农业部长廖鲁言在今天晚间举行宴会，欢迎以科·弗尔契克为首的捷克斯洛伐克农业科学代表团。

    弗尔契克在讲话中说，捷克斯洛伐克人民以很大的兴趣和欢欣鼓舞的心情密切注意着中国是如何在进行着国家的强大的工业化和农业的社会主义改造。先进的捷克斯洛伐克工业的劳动者们，将要尽一切力量来正确地完成中国工业和农业所必需的机器和设备的供应工作。
    接着，捷克斯洛伐克驻中国大使格里哥尔和林业部副部长罗玉川以及中捷两国的科学家们相继讲了话。
