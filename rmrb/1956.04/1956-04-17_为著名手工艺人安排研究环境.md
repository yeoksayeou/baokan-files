    Arranging Research Environment for Famous Handicraft Artists
    More than ten famous Shanghai special handicraft artists, including Xue Foying (jade and stone carving), He Keming (lantern art), Zhi Ci'an (bamboo carving), Zhao Kuoming (dough figurine), and Feng Qiuping (weaving), have recently started working at the Shanghai Municipal Arts and Crafts Research Institute. The Shanghai Municipal Arts and Crafts Cooperative Union is arranging a good environment for them to conduct research and create. Wang Yongyin, a famous eighty-two-year-old silk flower artist who cannot regularly work at the research institute, has also been hired as a consultant. These famous handicraft artists are formulating work plans and preparing to create more works and pass on their skills to thank the government for its care.

    为著名手工艺人安排研究环境
    上海市著名的特种手工艺人——玉石细刻艺人薛佛影、灯彩艺人何克明、竹刻艺人支慈庵、捏面人艺人赵阔明、编织艺人冯秋萍等十余人，最近已经到上海市美术工艺研究室工作。上海市美术工艺合作社联合社正在为他们安排研究和创作的良好环境。八十二岁的做绢花的著名艺人王永寅，不能经常到研究室工作，也被聘为顾问。这些著名手工艺人正在制定工作规划，准备多多创作和传授技艺，来答谢政府对他们的照顾。
