    Comprehensive Development of Hainan Island

    The first phase of surveying work for the development of Hainan Island, which began in December last year, has essentially concluded by early April this year. Nearly a thousand experts and staff participating in the survey have traversed every township of Hainan Island over the past few months, surveying over 18.8 million mu of wasteland and 7.17 million mu of barren mountains. At the same time, preliminary investigations in agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, and water conservancy have been completed. Therefore, it can be initially determined where and how large areas should be for coastal protection forests, sand fixation forests, farmland protection forests, and timber forests. Reliable data have been provided for arranging and developing subtropical crops on Hainan Island. Based on this data, the survey team has begun to formulate plans for developing agricultural crops and forestry. The overall plan for the comprehensive development of Hainan Island is expected to be completed by the end of June.

    全面开发海南岛
    开发海南岛的第一次勘察工作，从去年十二月开始进行，到今年四月上旬已经基本结束。参加勘察工作的近千名专家和工作人员，几个月来走遍了海南岛每一个乡，踏查了一千八百多万亩荒地和717万多亩荒山；同时完成了农、林、水产、水利等方面的初查工作。因而可以初步确定今后在沿海一带营造防护林、固沙林以及农田防护林、用材林的位置和面积。对安排和发展海南岛的亚热带作物提供了可靠的资料。根据这些资料，勘察队已经着手制定发展农业作物和林业的计划。全面开发海南岛的规划大约在六月底前即可完成。
