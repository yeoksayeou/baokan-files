Review of "Sanliwan"
	Lin Danqiu

Since the publication of Comrade Zhao Shuli's "Sanliwan," many reviews have been published in newspapers and magazines. Reviewers unanimously believe that it is one of the best works that has appeared recently, which is the evaluation that "Sanliwan" deserves. "Sanliwan" is indeed one of the rare outstanding works in the current Chinese literary and art circles and a valuable new achievement of Comrade Zhao Shuli's consistent creative labor of being faithful to life.

"Sanliwan" is a novel reflecting the agricultural cooperation movement. What is most noteworthy is the breadth and depth of the real life it touches. Agricultural cooperation is a profound social transformation, which will inevitably strongly stir social life, cause complex and sharp contradictions and conflicts, and cause major changes in people's lives, mental outlook, and interpersonal relationships. This change is the concrete manifestation of the profound social and political significance of the agricultural cooperation movement, which is precisely the realistic content that literary and artistic works should focus on reflecting. Some authors ignore the inextricable links between this movement and all aspects of real life, limit the objects of depiction to a narrow scope, and even use artificially created simplified contradictions and conflicts to replace the living contradictions and conflicts in real life, giving readers a boring and tedious feeling. The author of "Sanliwan" does the opposite, viewing the agricultural cooperation movement from the broad field of life, understanding the inevitability and arduousness of agricultural cooperation from the tortuous and complex changes in life and thought caused by this movement, and regarding this movement as the mainstream running through the entire rural social life. Under the guidance of such understanding, based on rich life experience and life knowledge, the author wields a fairly skilled brush, painting a true and moving picture of life, enabling the work to obtain deep and broad social content.

Literary and artistic creation should use the real image of the ever-changing life itself to display the law of life development. The life color and life atmosphere of the work are important factors constituting the artistic charm of the work. The basic feature of "Sanliwan" lies precisely here.

In this work, the life style and struggle scenes of Sanliwan, an old liberated area, in the early stage of agricultural cooperation are vividly presented on paper. The family life and social life under the author's pen both give people a sense of intimacy. The family of Wang Jinsheng, the secretary of the Party branch, the family of Fan Denggao, the village head, the family of Yuan Tiancheng, a member of the cooperative, and the family of Ma Duoshou, a member of the mutual aid group, all have their own characteristics and their own life atmosphere. And all the members of each family have their own ideas and opinions, their own joys and sorrows, and their own character traits. There are connections and contradictions between this family and that family, and between this person and that person. In daily life, there are comedies, tragedies, and tragicomedies. In the Qigan courtyard, the enthusiasm of the village cadres is boiling; in the Ma family courtyard, a big yellow dog always barks at strangers. Yuan Tiancheng was fooled by his wife and reported more private plots when joining the cooperative, and he was too busy to handle it, which was very embarrassing. Fan Denggao was thinking about his small business day and night and was not interested in new things. Wang Yusheng was fascinated by creative inventions in agricultural tools. Zhang Yongqing specializes in "firing cannons." Yuan Xiaodan never misses a chance to tell jokes. ... The people of Sanliwan live and work like this...

When the cooperative is to be expanded and the canal is to be opened, the call of the Party branch aroused different reactions. Some took the lead actively, some passively resisted, some secretly obstructed, and some wavered and leaned from side to side. Various contradictions and conflicts weave into magnificent social waves, impacting people's family life, impacting their spiritual world, making them unable to avoid being affected, unable to avoid changing, and unable to avoid advancing tortuously. The logic of real life awakened "Hututu," disrupted the "iron abacus," taught "Fan De Gao," refuted "Chang Youli," and even Yuan Tiancheng, who was always afraid of his wife, and Ma Youyi, who only dared to stare in the quilt, had to carry out family revolutions in sharp contradictions and conflicts. All of this is extracted from real life, not manufactured according to the framework of concepts, which is the fundamental reason why this work can move people. We see the struggle between the two lines through such a true picture of life, see the inevitability and arduousness of agricultural cooperation, and see the great role of the Party's leadership.

Generally speaking, most of the characters in "Sanliwan" are alive. "Neng Bugou's" sophistication and shrewishness, "Chang Youli's" stubbornness, "Hututu's" fake confusion, and Ma Youyi's true cowardice are all vividly displayed in front of readers. The author's abundant life experience and rich life knowledge are most fully displayed in the shaping of these images. And Wang Yusheng, who is smart and down-to-earth and devoted to creative work, and Wang Yumei, who is simple and kind and sometimes very sharp-tongued, are also images full of life and personality. We strongly smell the breath of new people growing from them.

Party branch secretary Wang Jinsheng and Party degenerate Fan Denggao are two important opposing figures in "Sanliwan" and also the objects that the author focuses on describing. Whether these two characters are written well or not has a serious impact on the panoramic view of the struggle reflected in the work. The author has achieved significant gains in shaping these two images, but has not achieved due achievements.

Wang Jinsheng is a Party cadre in the old liberated area, ordinary but outstanding. He does not know many characters and always considers the impact on the masses when dealing with problems, but sometimes his views are not very practical. This is an image that makes people feel close. It is a pity that in the author's pen, his spiritual life is not rich enough, his vitality is not strong enough, and he lacks a clear brilliance. The author vividly depicts some of his life details, giving readers a high degree of realism, but lacks a strong portrayal of the important scenes of his leadership struggle, giving people a "generalization" feeling to some extent. The author did not start from the profound connection between this native-born excellent Communist Party member and the masses in life and ideological feelings, and fully reflected the light and heat he radiated in the life and struggle of Sanliwan, which is the important reason why this image did not show more distinct personality characteristics and more abundant power.

Fan Denggao was a long-term worker in the old society and an old cadre during the pioneering period. He turned over high during the land reform. After his life improved, he forgot the painful life of driving mules for the landlord. Instead, he hired someone to drive mules for him and concentrated on doing small business. He invisibly became the center connecting all aspects of conservative and backward forces. He is a Communist Party member and village head, but he has a strong aversion to activities such as expanding the cooperative and opening the canal, and to the criticisms and accusations of the Party and the masses against him, thinking that the "golden hoop is getting tighter and tighter." It is understandable that such a person gradually becomes aware in such an environment, but his psychological appearance during the process of awakening is too vague. The author prominently expresses his selfish and self-interested thoughts and the attitude of being arrogant and relying on his old qualifications, but does not deeply excavate his inner contradictions, nakedly open the secrets of his spiritual world, and give his degeneration and awakening a realistic basis. This makes this image greatly diminished.

The main weakness of "Sanliwan" is that the main line of contradiction and struggle is not prominent enough. Some descriptions lack due restraint, diluting the atmosphere of struggle to some extent; some descriptions lack due weight and depth, and cannot give readers a strong excitement. Artistic creation is not a copy of life, but a refinement and generalization of life. Of course, concepts cannot be used to replace real life, but true life pictures should guide readers to deeply understand the essence of life, so that readers strongly feel the agitation of the mainstream of life full of contradictions, and hear the true echoes it causes in the depths of people's hearts. From this perspective, the achievements of "Sanliwan" are significant, but the author did not seize important life scenes to fully reveal life contradictions and character contradictions, and did not make the struggle mainstream of Sanliwan stand out in the life picture. Such a dramatic scene as Fan Denggao's quarrel with Xiao Ju being caught by Jinsheng was originally a good opportunity to reveal life contradictions and character contradictions, but it was lightly let go by the author, and "Fan Denggao's secret" was not completely exposed. This shows that the author's understanding of real life and struggle still lacks due depth, and at the same time, in the artistic creation of refining life, he still has to use more ingenuity. This is probably the reason why this work full of life atmosphere has not achieved compelling ideological power and aroused strong excitement in the ideological emotions of readers.

Under the requirements of further prosperity of literary and artistic creation, the outstanding achievements and main weaknesses of "Sanliwan" are worthy of our attention and research, because what we encounter here is precisely an important issue in our literary and artistic creation.

    评“三里湾”
    林淡秋
    赵树理同志的“三里湾”出版以来，报刊上发表了不少关于它的评论。评论者一致认为它是近来出现的好作品之一，这是“三里湾”应得的评价。“三里湾”确是当前我国文艺界不可多得的出色作品之一，是赵树理同志一贯忠于生活的创作劳动的可贵的新收获。
    “三里湾”是一部反映农业合作化运动的小说，首先值得注意的是它所接触的现实生活的广度和深度。农业合作化是一种深刻的社会改造，必然要强烈地搅动社会生活，引起复杂尖锐的矛盾和冲突，引起人的生活面貌、精神面貌和人与人的关系等方面的重大变化。这种变化是农业合作化运动的深刻社会意义和政治意义的具体表现，正是文艺作品应该着重反映的现实内容。有些作者忽视这一运动同各方面现实生活的千丝万缕的联系，把描写对象局限在狭窄的范围里，甚至用人工制造的简单化的矛盾和冲突来代替现实生活中的活生生的矛盾和冲突，给读者以枯燥乏味的感觉。“三里湾”的作者与此相反，从广阔的生活原野看农业合作化运动，从这一运动所引起的曲折复杂的生活变化和思想变化理解农业合作化的必然性和艰巨性，把这一运动看作贯串整个农村社会生活的主流。就在这样的认识的引导下，在丰富的生活实感和生活知识的基础上，作者挥动相当熟练的画笔，画出了真实动人的生活图景，使作品取得了深广的社会内容。
    文艺创作应该用气象万千的生活本身的真实形象来展示生活发展的规律，作品的生活色彩和生活气息，是构成作品的艺术魅力的重要因素。“三里湾”的基本特色正在这里。
    在这部作品里，老解放区三里湾在农业合作化初期的生活风貌和斗争情景跃然纸上。作者笔下的家庭生活和社会生活，都给人以亲切感。支部书记王金生家、村长范登高家、合作社社员袁天成家、互助组组员马多寿家，都各有各的特色，各有各的生活气氛。而每一家庭的所有成员，也各有各的想法和看法，各有各的欢乐和苦恼，各有各的性格特征。这家与那家之间，这人与那人之间，有联系也有矛盾。在日常生活中，有喜剧、有悲剧、有悲喜剧。在旗杆院，沸腾着村干部们的工作热潮；在马家院，一只大黄狗老对生人叫。袁天成上了老婆的当，入社时多报了自留地，一双手忙不过来，非常尴尬。范登高日夜为自己的小买卖打算，对新事物不感兴趣。王玉生醉心于农具方面的创造发明。张永清专门“放炮”。袁小旦从不放过说俏皮话的机会。……三里湾的人们便这样生活着，工作着……。
    要扩社了，要开渠了，党支部的号召激起了不同的反响。有的积极带头，有的消极抵制，有的暗中阻挠，有的摇摆不定，东歪西倒。各种矛盾和冲突，织成了壮阔的社会波澜，冲击着人们的家庭生活，冲击着他们的精神世界，使他们不能不受影响，不能不起变化，不能不曲折地前进。现实生活的逻辑，惊醒了“糊涂涂”，打乱了“铁算盘”，教训了“翻得高”，驳倒了“常有理”，连一向怕老婆的袁天成和只敢躲在被窝里瞪眼睛的马有翼，也在尖锐的矛盾和冲突中不得不进行家庭革命了。而这一切都是从现实生活中提炼出来的，而不是依照概念的架子制造出来的，这就是这部作品之所以能感动人的根本原因。我们就通过这样真实的生活画面，看到了两条路线的斗争，看到了农业合作的必然性和艰巨性，看到了党的领导的伟大作用。
    一般说来，“三里湾”里的多数人物形象都是活的。“能不够”的世故和泼辣，“常有理”的顽固，“糊涂涂”的假糊涂，马有翼的真窝囊，都活生生地显现在读者眼前。作者的充沛的生活实感和丰富的生活知识在这些形象的塑造上得到了最充分的发挥。而聪明踏实、醉心于创造性工作的王玉生和淳朴可亲、有时口齿又非常锋利的王玉梅等，也都是富有生命和个性的形象，我们从他们身上强烈地闻到在成长中的新人的气息。
    党支部书记王金生和党内蜕化分子范登高，是“三里湾”中两个针锋相对的重要人物，也是作者着重描写的对象。这两个人物写得好不好，对于作品所反映的斗争全景有严重的影响。在这两个形象的塑造上，作者得到显著的收获，但没有得到应有的成就。
    王金生是老解放区的党员干部，平凡而又出色，识字不多，处理问题总是顾到群众影响，而有时的看法又不大切合实际。这是一个叫人感到亲切的形象。可惜在作者的笔下，他的精神生活不够丰富，他的生命力不够旺盛，他缺乏鲜明的光彩。作者出色地描绘了他的某些生活细节，给读者以高度的真实感，但对他领导斗争的重要场景，却缺乏有力的刻划，多少给人“一般化”的感觉。作者没有从这个土生土长的优秀共产党员在生活和思想感情上同群众的深刻联系着眼、下笔，充分反映出他在三里湾的生活和斗争中所放射的光和热，这就是这个形象所以没有显示出更鲜明的性格特征和更充沛的力量的重要原因。
    范登高是旧社会的长工、开辟工作时期的老干部，土地改革时翻身翻得高，生活好起来了，便忘记了自己给地主赶骡子的痛苦生活，反而雇人给自己赶骡子，专心专意做起小买卖来了，无形中成为联系各方面保守落后势力的中心。他是共产党员、村长，但对扩社、开渠等活动，对党和群众对他的批评指责，都有强烈的反感，认为“金箍儿越收越紧”了。这样的人物在那样的环境里逐渐觉悟过来，那是可以理解的，但他在觉悟过程中的心理面貌太模糊了。作者突出地表现了他的自私自利思想和自高自大的摆老资格作风，但没有深刻地发掘他的内心矛盾，赤裸裸地打开他的精神世界的秘密，使他的蜕化和觉悟都取得现实的根据。这就使得这个形象大大减色了。
    “三里湾”的主要弱点在于矛盾和斗争的主线不够突出。有些描写缺乏应有的节制，多少冲淡了斗争的气氛；有些描写缺乏应有的分量和深度，不能给读者以强烈的激动。艺术创造不是生活的复制，而是生活的提炼和概括。固然不能用概念去代替现实生活，但真实的生活画面应该引导读者深刻地认识生活的本质，使读者强烈地感觉到充满矛盾的生活主流的激荡，听到它在人的心灵深处引起的真实的回声。从这样的角度看，“三里湾”的成就是显著的，但作者没有抓住重要的生活场景来充分揭露生活矛盾和性格矛盾，没有使三里湾的斗争主流在生活画面上凸现出来。像范登高和小聚吵闹被金生撞见那样戏剧性场面，原是揭露生活矛盾和性格矛盾的好机会，可是被作者轻轻放过了，“范登高的秘密”并没有彻底暴露出来。这说明了作者对现实生活和斗争的理解还缺乏应有的深度，同时在提炼生活的艺术创造上，也还得运用更多的匠心。这部富有生活气息的作品所以没有取得逼人的思想力量，在读者的思想情绪上唤起强烈的激动，原因就在这里吧。
    在进一步繁荣文艺创作的要求下，“三里湾”的突出成就和主要弱点都值得我们重视和研究，因为在这里碰到的正是我们文艺创作上的重要问题。
