    Xiamen University Establishes Overseas Chinese Correspondence Department

    Xiamen University recently established an Overseas Chinese Correspondence Department.

    The Overseas Chinese Correspondence Department was established to train teachers for overseas Chinese secondary schools and to improve the scientific and cultural level of teachers currently in service. The Correspondence Department will initially offer specialist courses in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, with a study period tentatively set at two years. The Correspondence Department plans to begin enrolling in-service teachers from Southeast Asian Chinese secondary schools and young people from society with a high school education level for correspondence learning in the autumn of this year.
