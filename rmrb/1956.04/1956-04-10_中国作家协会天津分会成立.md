Preliminary plans call for the creation of ninety-three new works (pieces) by the end of the year.

The plan also places great importance on cultivating young literary creators.
    At this conference, the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Writers Association was formally established, and a council of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Writers Association was elected, consisting of thirteen people including Fang Ji, Sun Li, and Li Jiyie.
    The Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Writers Association decided to establish a Young Literature Work Committee to vigorously cultivate young writers. In order to promote creative work, the branch also decided to establish a Creation Committee and launch the literary monthly "New Port" in the third quarter of this year.
