Deeply Transforming Rural Private Merchants

At present, the majority of rural private merchants have accepted socialist transformation. A total of 1.68 million rural private merchants have been transformed through forms such as joint ventures, cooperative stores, agency purchase, agency sales, and distribution, accounting for over 60% of the total number of rural private merchants in the country. After socialist transformation, the enthusiasm of most merchants for business has increased, and the capitalistic business practices of some individuals that violated the interests of the masses have been overcome and changed to varying degrees.

Incorporating rural private merchants into various forms of socialist transformation does not mean the end of socialist transformation work. In addition to the work of clearing assets and verifying capital, some shops that have been approved for joint ventures also need to carry out a series of tasks such as economic restructuring and ideological remolding of personnel. Cooperative stores that have been organized must also be further rectified and consolidated in order to give full play to the superiority of being organized. Vendors engaged in agency purchase, agency sales, and distribution should be given effective assistance and appropriate transformation according to their different situations.

In some areas, due to the excessively rapid pace of socialist transformation work, many problems have been left behind and must be promptly and appropriately resolved. For example, some areas have inappropriately carried out large-scale mergers, combining shops and stalls that should not have been merged; some areas have changed certain business methods of some merchants that were adapted to the needs of farmers; some areas have set the price difference for small commodities and the handling fees for agency purchase and sales too low; some areas have excessively implemented the method of fixed wages for merchants. This has not only affected the enthusiasm of rural private merchants for business, but also hindered the circulation of rural commodities and the normal buying and selling needs of farmers to varying degrees.

These situations show that the task of transforming rural merchants is still very arduous. In the current period, in addition to areas where the transformation work is progressing slowly, it is necessary to seize the time to carry out organizational transformation work, and areas that have already carried out organizational transformation should actively develop supply and marketing business and promptly shift the focus of transformation to the economic restructuring of enterprises and the ideological remolding of personnel.

In order to thoroughly do this work, it is necessary to adapt to the farmers' requirements for commodity purchase and sale and grasp the characteristics of rural private commerce. The characteristics of private commerce in rural China are: there are many small merchants and peddlers, the division of labor is very rough, and only a very few engage in specialized operations. Their activities are very scattered, with a wide range and many points. Generally, private merchants have very little capital, simple equipment, fast turnover, and high interest rates. There are few people who are purely engaged in business, many who are half-farmer and half-merchant, and many who have family shops. They have flexible business hours and attentive service; they have many purchasing relationships and a wide range of sales relationships; their accounts are simple and procedures are convenient; they combine purchase and sale and have great mobility. Due to the development of agricultural production and the improvement of people's living standards, the broad masses of farmers require rural commerce to meet their diverse needs, and to be convenient for buying and selling, saving time.

According to these characteristics of rural private merchants and these requirements of the masses of farmers, different transformation methods should be adopted for rural private merchants of different natures and types. Family shops that operate daily necessities and odd goods scattered in the countryside and peddlers who combine purchase and sale and travel through the countryside are suitable for adopting the forms of agency purchase, agency sales, and distribution, and can also operate some odd goods that supply and marketing cooperatives do not operate. In this way, not only can their business characteristics that meet the needs of the masses be maintained and developed, but also it is convenient to give play to the auxiliary labor force in their families. Most small merchants and some fixed stallholders in market towns, and some small merchants in rural areas who operate more fixedly and whose family shops can be separated, can organize cooperative stores on the principle of their own free will. Some overly scattered, piecemeal snack stalls and small vendors who operate unfixedly with seasonal changes are also an indispensable part of the national commodity circulation plan. These people should be registered and managed, and when necessary, mutual aid groups can be formed by area. For the very small number of commercial capitalists in rural areas and some industries in market towns with more capital and larger businesses that involve processing, the form of joint ventures can be adopted.

Wages, small commodity interest rates, and agency purchase and sales handling fees should be reasonably determined in accordance with the principle of improving the enthusiasm of rural private merchants for business and gradually implementing the principle of distribution according to work. Fixed wages are easy to calculate and can guarantee a certain income for small merchants, but they cannot stimulate their enthusiasm for business, so they should not be universally adopted. In joint venture stores and cooperative stores, in addition to the need to implement a fixed wage system for a few people, the main form should be a basic wage plus bonus wage. In order to implement this wage system, it is first necessary to determine the operating quota so that they can earn more by selling more. The quota should be set very reasonably according to the specific conditions such as seasonal changes, supply of goods, operating location, and commodity variety. It is not good to set it too low or too high. These several forms of wages basically conform to the principle of distribution according to work and can encourage enthusiasm for business.

The income of small merchants who engage in agency purchase and sales is mainly handling fees. In order to simplify the procedures for agency sales, some agency sales households can adopt methods such as fixed price difference and cash purchase, and deduction of handling fees. The amount of handling fees should be reasonably stipulated according to conditions such as the difficulty of commodity operation, the speed of turnover, and the size of prices. The handling fee rate for small commodities should be appropriately increased. The handling fees for agency purchase and sales households with small operating amounts in remote areas can also be appropriately increased. For some small general merchandise and small sundry goods, merchants can be allowed to determine the prices themselves in order to maintain a certain income and encourage their enthusiasm for business.

Transforming rural private commerce is a major event that affects the lives of hundreds of millions of people and must never be done in a simple and crude way. Areas that have already carried out organizational transformation should conduct an in-depth inspection. Any organizational forms that are not appropriate should be adjusted realistically in conjunction with the rational deployment of the commercial network. Wage regulations that are unreasonable should also be adjusted reasonably. In order to meet the requirements of farmers, the scope of activity of private merchants and peddlers distributed in rural areas should not only not be inappropriately merged, but also needs to be appropriately expanded, and the variety of goods should be increased. The original operating characteristics of rural private merchants that are suitable for the people's needs, such as being familiar with the needs of the masses, flexible and attentive service methods, traveling through the countryside, and delivering goods to the door, should all be retained and developed. For those who blindly abandon business and turn to agriculture, persuasion and education should be carried out to encourage them to continue doing business in order to maintain commercial personnel adapted to the needs of commodity circulation.

### 深入地改造农村私营商贩

    深入地改造农村私营商贩
    目前，大部分农村私商已经接受了社会主义改造。通过合营、合作商店、代购、代销和经销等形式改造的农村私商已有168万人，占全国农村私商总人数的百分之六十几。经过社会主义改造以后，多数商贩的经营积极性提高了，某些人的违反群众利益的资本主义经营作风，有了不同程度的克服和改变。
    把农村私商纳入社会主义改造的各种形式，绝不意味着社会主义改造工作的结束。一些被批准合营的商店，除了清产核资工作以外，还需要进行经济改组、人员思想改造等一系列的工作。组织起来的合作商店，也要进一步加以整顿和巩固，才能发挥组织起来的优越性。代购、代销和经销的商贩，更应当分别不同的情况，给以有效的帮助和适当的改造。
    在部分地区，由于社会主义改造工作的速度过快，遗留了不少问题，必须迅速加以适当的解决。例如，有的地区不适当地进行大合大并，把一些不应该合并的店、摊合并起来了；有的地区把某些商贩的某些适应农民需要的经营方式改变了；有的地区对小商品的差价和代购代销的手续费订的偏低；有的地区过多地对商贩实行固定工资的报酬办法。这不但影响了农村私商的经营积极性，而且在不同程度上妨碍了农村商品的流转和农民的正常的购销需要。
    这些情况说明，改造农村商贩的任务仍然是很艰巨的。在目前一段时期，除了改造工作进行较慢的地区，要抓紧时间进行组织改造工作以外，已经进行了组织改造的地区，应该积极开展供销业务，把改造的重心及时转到企业的经济改组和人员思想的改造方面来。
    为了彻底做好这些工作，必须适应农民对商品购销的要求，掌握农村私营商业的特点。我国农村中的私营商业的特点是：小商小贩很多，分工很粗，只有极少数进行专业经营。他们的活动很分散，面广、点多。一般私商的资金很少，设备简单，周转快，利率高。单纯经商的人员少，半农半商的人员多，连家铺多。他们营业时间灵活，服务态度周到；进货关系多，销货关系广；账目简单，手续简便；购销兼营，流动性大。由于农业生产的发展和人民生活水平的提高，广大农民要求农村商业要满足他们多种多样的需要，并且要买卖方便，节省时间。
    根据农村私商的这些特点和农民群众的这些要求，应该分别不同的性质和类型，对农村私商采取不同的改造方式。分散在农村中经营日用零星商品的连家铺和购销兼营的串乡商贩，适于采取代购、代销、经销的形式，并且可以自营一部分供销社不经营的零星商品。这样，不但可以保持和发挥他们那些适应群众要求的经营特点，并且便于发挥他们家庭中的辅助劳动力。集镇上大部分小商人和一部分固定摊贩，和农村中一部分经营较固定、家铺可分开的小商贩，可以在他们自愿的原则下组织合作商店。有些过于分散、零星的小吃摊和随季节变化的不固定经营的小商贩，同样是国家商品流转计划中不可缺少的一部分。对这些人应该进行登记和管理，在必要的时候，可以按片组成互助小组。对于农村中为数很少的商业资本家和集镇上某些资金较多、业务较大的带加工性的行业，可以采用合营的形式。
    工资、小商品利率和代购代销手续费，应该按照提高农村私营商贩经营积极性和逐步贯彻按劳取酬的原则合理地确定。固定工资便于核算，能够保证小商贩一定的收入，但是不能刺激他们的经营积极性，所以不宜普遍采用。在合营商店、合作商店中，除了少数人需要实行固定工资制以外，主要应当采取基本工资加奖励的工资形式。为了实行这种工资制度，首先要确定经营定额，使他们能够多卖多得。定额根据季节变化、货源供应情况、经营地址、商品品种等具体情况，定的要很合理，过低过高都是不好的。这几种工资形式基本上符合按劳取酬的原则，并能发生鼓励经营积极性的作用。
    代购代销的小商贩的收入主要是手续费。为了简化代销的手续，对某些代销户可以采取差价包干和现款进货、倒扣手续费等计酬办法。手续费的多少，应当根据商品经营难易、周转快慢、价格大小等条件，加以合理地规定。小商品的手续费率要适当提高。偏僻地区的经营额小的代购代销户的手续费，也可适当提高。对于某些小百货和小杂货，可允许商贩自行确定价格，以保持他们一定的收入和鼓励他们的经营积极性。
    改造农村私营商业是关系几万万人民生活的大事，决不能采取简单粗糙的办法。已经进行了组织改造的地区，应该进行一次深入的检查。凡是组织形式不够恰当的，都应当结合商业网的合理部署，实事求是地加以调整。工资规定不合理的，也应该加以合理的调整。为了满足农民的要求，对于分布在农村的私商小贩，不仅不应该进行不适当的合并，而且需要适当地扩大他们的流动范围，增加商品品种。对于农村私商中原有的适合人民需要的经营特点，例如，熟悉群众需要，服务方式灵活、周到，串乡、送货上门等等，都应该加以保留和发扬。对于那些盲目地弃商转农的人员，要加以说服教育，使他们继续经商，以保持和商品流转需要相适应的商业人员。
