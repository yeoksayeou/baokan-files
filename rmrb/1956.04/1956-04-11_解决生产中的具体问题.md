Solving Specific Problems in Production
Luo Yi

Henghe Township in Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, is a high-yield rice area. Last year, the average yield per mu was 738 jin. This township basically achieved cooperativization last winter, and this year a pumping station has been established here, with over 80% of the land irrigable by pumps. The farmers' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high, and they plan to strive for an average rice yield of 1,100 jin per mu for the whole township.

Since the beginning of spring, the attendance rate of agricultural cooperative members has generally been above 90% every day, and great achievements have been made in spring plowing preparations. By early March, the whole township had dredged over 119,000 boats of river mud, an average of six boats of river mud that can be applied per mu. The growth of green manure is better than last year. As long as we seize the time to apply top dressing fertilizer in the green manure fields, we can apply about 2,000 jin of green manure per mu of paddy field.

Although this township has made some achievements, there are still many problems in the current production. If these are not resolved quickly, there is still a risk that the production increase plan will fail. In early March, the Provincial Party Committee inspection team came here to help the township general branch discover and solve these problems.

What are these problems?

First, there is a shortage of seeds. This year, the township plans to plant double-cropping rice on 86% of the rice area and double-intercropping rice on 3%. In addition, the implementation of close planting has greatly increased the need for seeds. According to statistics from the 28 cooperatives in the township, there is a shortage of 13,000 jin of early rice seeds and 50,000 jin of late rice seeds. Do the masses have seeds in their hands? Yes, they do. This township has transferred out seeds in previous years, and last year it had a bumper harvest, with grain production generally exceeding the "three fix" production standards. However, some members have a mentality of relying on cooperatives and the state and are unwilling to take them out; some members resist the idea of close planting and are unwilling to take out more. In order to solve this problem, the township staff went to the People's Sluice Cooperative for a pilot project. They educated the members by calculating accounts, explaining the benefits of close planting, the benefits of achieving the production increase plan for the country and the members, and the principle that production increase mainly depends on the members' own efforts, and mobilized the members to raise seeds themselves. For individual households whose rations are insufficient due to the payment of seeds, it was decided to give appropriate consideration. After taking the above measures, the seed shortage problem of this cooperative was basically solved. The Party General Branch promoted this experience throughout the township and carried out the work of mutual adjustment of seeds between cooperatives and between members. At the same time, a portion of seeds was allocated from the higher authorities. In this way, the seed shortage problem of the whole township was basically solved.

Second, there is a shortage of labor. Due to the large-scale promotion of double-cropping rice and the implementation of close planting, the labor required has greatly increased. General calculation: planting double-cropping rice and implementing close planting requires about twice as much labor as in the past. All cooperatives feel that there is a shortage of labor. The township staff, together with the staff and members of the Wushan First Cooperative, studied the results and proved that the difficulty of labor shortage can be overcome by arranging labor, arranging farm work, and formulating labor plans, as long as the potential labor force is tapped from all aspects. How do they solve the problem of labor shortage? (1) It is to earnestly mobilize women to participate in production. In order to mobilize women to participate in production, it is first necessary to overcome the male members' mentality of belittling women and use the role that women have already shown in production to educate male members. Second, resolutely implement the policy of equal pay for equal work for men and women. Third, it is to solve the practical difficulties after women participate in production and prepare to hold busy farming childcare groups. Finally, male members should help female members improve their production skills and give more praise and less criticism to women in production. As long as these points are achieved, it can be guaranteed that more than 90% of women can participate in production. (2) They estimate that this year's summer harvest and summer planting time will only be more than 20 days in total. If all kinds of farm work are squeezed together, labor will feel even more insufficient. Therefore, they plan to plant 20% of early maturing rice (a type of early rice). Early maturing rice matures six to ten days earlier than ordinary early rice. In this way, more than 2,500 workdays can be transferred. (3) Improve transplanting skills. They plan to ask transplanting experts in the cooperative to introduce their experiences, teach more members transplanting, improve labor efficiency, and strive to reduce the number of workdays from four and a half to four per mu of double-cropping rice, including pulling seedlings and planting. In this way, more than 1,000 workdays can be saved. (4) Use a large number of rice threshers. The whole cooperative now has two rice threshers and plans to purchase 28 more before the summer harvest and summer planting. Each rice thresher can save 37 workdays compared to manual threshing, for a total of 742 workdays. (5) During the summer harvest and summer planting, strive for each worker to work one more hour per day, for a total of more than 1,300 workdays. By adopting the above measures, the original estimate of a shortage of more than 6,500 workdays during the summer harvest and summer planting can now be basically solved.

In addition, during the inspection, it was also found that some early spring crops were growing poorly, mainly because the staff and the masses both had the idea of "emphasizing rice and neglecting spring crops" and did not cultivate early spring crops enough. Currently, they are stepping up fertilization and weeding and doing a good job in cultivation, striving for a bumper harvest of early spring crops.

Through this inspection, specific problems have been solved, and the masses have even greater confidence in increasing production. They unanimously believe that this year's production increase plan can be fully realized.

    解决生产中的具体问题
    罗毅
    浙江省余姚县横河乡是水稻高产量地区。去年每亩平均产量为738斤。这个乡去年冬天基本上实现了合作化，今年这里又设立了抽水机站，80％以上的土地可用抽水机灌溉。农民的生产积极性空前高涨，计划争取全乡水稻每亩平均产量达到一千一百斤。
    入春以来，农业生产合作社社员每天的出勤率一般在90％以上，春耕准备工作已经取得很大的成绩。到三月上旬止，全乡共捻河泥十一万九千多船，平均每亩可施河泥六船。绿肥生长情况比去年好，只要抓紧在绿肥地里施追肥，可以达到每亩水田施绿肥二千斤左右。
    这个乡虽然有了这么一些成绩，但是在当前的生产中还是有许多问题，如果不迅速解决，仍有使增产计划落空的危险。三月上旬，省委检查组来到这里，帮助乡总支发现和解决了这些问题。
    这是一些什么问题呢？
    一、种子不足。今年这个乡计划种植双季连作稻的面积占水稻面积的86％，双季间作稻占3％。加上实行密植，种子的需要量大大增加了。全乡二十八个社的统计，共缺早稻种一万三千斤，晚稻种五万斤。群众手里有没有种子呢？有的。这个乡在往年都调出种子，去年又获丰收，粮食产量普遍超过“三定”定产标准。但是部分社员有依赖合作社和国家的思想，不愿拿出来；部分社员对密植思想抵触，不愿多拿。为了解决这一问题，乡的工作人员就到人民闸合作社进行试点。他们用算账的办法对社员进行教育，说明密植的好处，说明实现增产计划对国家对社员的好处，以及增产主要依靠社员自己努力的道理，发动社员自筹种子。对个别户因交纳种子而口粮不足的，决定予以适当照顾。采取以上办法后，这个社缺种的问题基本上解决了。党总支把这一经验在全乡推广，开展了社和社、社员和社员之间相互调剂种子的工作。同时，上级又分配下来一部分种子。这样，全乡缺种问题基本上解决了。
    二、劳动力不足。由于大规模推广连作稻和实行密植，需要的劳动力大大增加。一般计算：种连作稻和实行密植要比过去增加一倍左右的劳动力。各社都感到劳动力不足。乡的工作人员同乌山第一合作社的工作人员和社员研究的结果，证明通过劳力排队、农活排队、制定劳动规划，只要从各方面挖掘劳动潜在力量，劳力不足的困难是可以克服的。他们是怎样解决劳力不足问题的呢？（一）是认真发动妇女参加生产。为了发动妇女参加生产，首先要克服男社员轻视妇女的思想，用妇女在生产中已经显示的作用来教育男社员。其次，坚决执行男女同工同酬政策。再次，是解决妇女参加生产后的实际困难问题，准备举办农忙托儿组。最后，男社员要帮助女社员提高生产技术，在生产中对妇女多表扬，少批评。只要做到这几条，就可以保证90％以上的妇女都能参加生产。（二）他们预计到今年夏收夏种的时间总共只有二十多天，如果各种农活都挤在一起，劳力就会更加感到不足。因此，他们计划种20％的早火稻（是早稻的一种品种）。早火稻比一般早稻成熟期早六天至十天。这样，可以调剂出二千五百多个工。（三）提高插秧技术。他们计划请社里插秧能手介绍经验，教会更多的社员插秧，提高劳动效率，争取每亩连作稻连拔秧带种田由四个半工减少到四个工。这样共可节约一千多个工。（四）大量使用打稻机。全社现有打稻机二部，计划夏收夏种前添购二十八部。每部打稻机比人工打稻可节约三十七个工，共可节约七四二个工。（五）在夏收夏种期间，争取每个劳动力每天多做工一小时，总共可多做一千三百多个工。采用以上办法，原来预计在夏收夏种中缺少六千五百多个工，现在基本上可以解决了。
    此外，在检查中还发现了部分早春作物生长不良，主要是工作人员和群众都有“重水稻、轻春花”的思想，对早春作物培育不够。目前正在加紧施肥锄草，做好培育工作，争取早春作物丰收。
    通过这次检查，解决了具体问题，群众的增产信心更高了，一致认为今年的增产计划可以完全实现。
