    Solutions to the Shortage of Draft Cattle
    In Meixian County, Guangdong Province, agricultural production cooperatives have overcome the difficulty of insufficient animal power during spring plowing by planning the use of draft cattle. At the same time, they have overcome the tendency of some cooperative staff and members to reject old and weak cattle and blindly claim a shortage of cattle. For example, the Xuan Keng Township agricultural production cooperative, with 146 mu of land and eleven draft cattle, originally had enough. However, because the cooperative members preferred water buffalo over yellow cattle, and strong cattle over old and weak cattle, they felt that they were short two water buffalo. Later, after planning, different labor quotas were assigned according to the condition of various types of draft cattle, correcting the bias against old and weak cattle, and there was no need to increase the number of cattle. The Long Peng Township originally said it was short fifteen draft cattle, but after planning, not only was there no shortage, but there were fifty extra, which were used to support nearby agricultural production cooperatives that truly lacked cattle.

    解决耕牛不足的办法
    广东省梅县各农业生产合作社，通过规划耕牛，克服了春耕中畜力不足的困难；同时克服了部分社的工作人员和社员中排斥老牛、弱牛和盲目叫喊缺牛的偏向。比如轩坑乡农业生产合作社，有146亩土地，十一头耕牛，本来够用，由于社员中要水牛不要黄牛，要壮牛不要老弱牛，认为缺乏水牛二头。以后经过规划，根据各类耕牛的情况，分配不同的劳动定额，纠正了排斥老、弱牛的偏向，就不必增牛了。龙砰乡原来说缺耕牛十五头，经过规划，不但不缺，还多出了五十头，支援附近真正缺牛的农业生产合作社。（本报驻广州记者）
