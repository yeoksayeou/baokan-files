Reactions to Criticisms and Suggestions

    A letter from the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory: The criticism of our factory for not caring about the welfare of workers in the "Reader's Letters" section on March 5th is correct. Because our work is not thorough and our mass perspective is not strong enough, some of the difficulties in the lives of the workers have not been resolved in a timely manner. In the future, we will definitely correct this situation thoroughly. We have decided to allocate a portion of the factory director's fund to subsidize the insufficient welfare expenses, and the wages of the canteen workers and management expenses will be paid from administrative expenses. The charging system for telephones, guest houses, and emergency vehicles has been abolished. In addition, we will improve the work of the canteen, sanatorium, and nursery.

    A letter from the local state-owned Liaoning No. 4 Silk Reeling Factory: We accept the criticism of our factory for not caring about the lives of workers in the "Reader's Letters" section on January 22nd. Our factory's leading cadres have serious bureaucratic work styles and capitalist management ideas, and do not care about the suffering of workers, resulting in the death of Zhu Baoshan and the miscarriage of Sun Guixiu. In the future, we are determined to improve our leadership style and do a good job in the welfare of our employees.

    A letter from the First Automobile Accessories Factory: The criticism of our factory for having too many and too long meetings, encroaching on the spare time of employees in the "Reader's Letters" section on February 19th is correct. We have now established some necessary systems to solve this problem.

    A letter from the China Timber Company's Harbin City Company: After the "Reader's Letters" section published the letter "Is This an Irresistible Loss?" on January 22nd, we examined our past mistakes of being irresponsible in our work and indifferent to state property, and we felt very distressed. We have organized employees to rectify the timber stacks, repaired the storage yards, and guaranteed to improve the management of timber in the future and eliminate waste.

    A letter from the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Railways: The criticism of the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory for its poor repair quality in the "Reader's Letters" section on April 1st is correct. We have ordered the factory leadership to examine the work and study improvement measures.

    A letter from the Xiangfang Timber Processing Factory of the Northeast Timber Industry Administration Bureau: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" section on March 11th that the quality of the timber we sold to the Materials Supply Department of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee was not good is correct. This timber was transferred in 1954. Because it was not suitable for making plywood, it had been stored for a long time. Our factory did not properly store this batch of timber, and lacked strict inspection before selling it, which was wrong. We will definitely pay attention to correcting this in the future.

    A letter from the Technical Inspection Section of the State-owned Tianjin Paper Mill: The criticism from the Shandong Dazhong Daily on April 9th in the "Reader's Letters" section regarding the poor quality of our printing paper is correct. After research by engineering and technical personnel, we have decided to adjust and repair the gloss rollers in the second quarter, increase the brightness of the paper, and solve the problem of linting.

    A letter from the Materials Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture: The situation reflected and the opinions put forward in the letter "Demanding More Supply of Tractor Parts" in the "Reader's Letters" section on March 18th are correct. In the future, in addition to strengthening planning in imported goods, we will also organize and supervise domestic agricultural machinery factories to step up production and deliver goods early.
