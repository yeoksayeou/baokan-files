In some areas, people busy themselves with planting trees every spring, but they do not cherish the existing trees and cultivated saplings, allowing them to suffer from man-made and natural destruction. There are many such examples in Heilongjiang Province. The Third Agricultural Production Cooperative of Lihua Village in Longjiang County destroyed one hectare of mountain land with a slope of more than 25 degrees that had been greened in the past, and cut down 1,500 trees. Wanfa Village in the same county destroyed more than 5,000 young oak trees planted in 1954; 20% of the ten hectares of saplings in Jiuli and Rongfu villages in the Baisan District were destroyed. The Bada Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the former Hailin County destroyed three hectares of oak tree groves on the hillside (more than 5,000 trees per hectare), turning the green and shady mountains into bald mountains. This phenomenon is also occurring in some state-owned farms. The Qixingpao Farm in Dedu County arbitrarily felled 813 pine, poplar, birch, and elm trees in scattered forests. The Longjiang County Farm grazed livestock in the forest network without proper management, resulting in damage to more than half a hectare of saplings. In order to reclaim wasteland, the Qingyang Farm in Yanshou County destroyed about fifteen hectares of forest land, and also cut down many trees along roadsides and riverbanks.

The main reason for the serious destruction of trees is that the leading organs of many counties and districts have long neglected forest protection work. Some staff members even believe that trees are everywhere, and it doesn't matter if they cut down a few. These comrades have adopted an erroneous attitude of turning a blind eye and tacitly approving when they see people destroying trees.

The act of destroying forests must be stopped quickly. Party organizations and governments at all levels in areas where forest destruction has occurred must correct the bias of only paying attention to afforestation and not to forest protection, closely combine afforestation with the protection of existing forests, and conduct regular and extensive education among the masses to protect both newly planted forests and existing forests.

    制止破坏林木的行为
    赫重运
    有些地区每年春天都要为植树造林忙碌一阵，但是，对于已有的树木和已经营造的幼林却不爱护，任其遭受人为的和自然的破坏。黑龙江省就有很多这样的例子。龙江县利华村第三农业生产合作社把过去已经绿化的二十五度以上的山地毁坏了一公顷，砍下树木一千五百株。这个县的万发村把1954年种的幼柞树毁坏五千多株；白山区九里、荣福等村的十公顷幼树被毁坏了20％。原海林县八达村农业生产合作社把山坡上的柞树丛毁掉三公顷（每公顷有树五千株以上），使绿树成荫的山地变成秃山。这种现象在某些国营农场中也在发生。德都县七星泡农场随便在散生林中砍伐松木和杨、桦、栬木等达813株。龙江县农场到林网中放牧，对牲畜又不加管理，以致损毁半公顷多幼林。延寿县庆阳农场为了开荒，毁坏林地约十五公顷，同时把许多公路旁、河岸的树木也砍掉。
    发生严重破坏树木的现象的主要原因，是很多县、区领导机关长期不管护林工作。有些工作人员甚至认为，树木到处都是，砍伐一点没有关系。这些同志看到有人砍毁树木，采取了熟视无睹和默许的错误态度。
    破坏林木的行为必须迅速制止。发生破坏林木现象的地区的各级党组织和政府必须纠正那种只顾造林不管护林的偏向，把造林工作和保护现有林木的工作密切结合起来，经常地、广泛地向群众进行教育，把新造的林和原有的林都保护好。
