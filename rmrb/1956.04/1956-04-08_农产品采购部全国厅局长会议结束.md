The National Conference of Department and Bureau Chiefs of the Agricultural Products Procurement Department was held in Beijing from March 20th to April 5th by the Agricultural Products Procurement Department. The conference focused on discussing improvements to the methods of agricultural product procurement, establishing and improving procurement organizations, studying and expanding the utilization of rural resources, and the training and education of cadres. The conference recognized the important significance of advance procurement of agricultural products. This year, in addition to continuing to implement advance cotton procurement, advance procurement of tea, ramie, flue-cured tobacco, and wool will also be expanded. To this end, the conference believes that it is necessary to promptly carry out tasks such as signing, reviewing, fulfilling, and finally clearing and settling agricultural product advance procurement contracts.
The conference believes that the volume of agricultural products coming on the market during the peak season this year will increase by more than half compared to 1955. At present, it is necessary to actively carry out various preparations for welcoming the peak season, such as rationally distributing procurement stations, organizing procurement teams and procurement personnel to go to the countryside, and establishing ties with agricultural cooperatives, in order to expand direct procurement. The conference also believes that doing a good job in the initial processing of agricultural products, improving product quality, and ensuring specifications are also very important. This requires close cooperation with agricultural departments, strengthening technical guidance for farmers and herdsmen, accurate inspection of grades, correct implementation of price policies, and correcting the tendency of downgrading and lowering prices or upgrading and raising prices.
The conference called on all regions to study and open up new agricultural resources to achieve full utilization. To promote the stripping of cotton stalk skin, cotton seed delinting, the utilization of wild hemp, sisal, and tobacco stalk skin, to promote the cultivation of second-crop tobacco, increase the picking of summer and autumn tea, strengthen the procurement of wild tea, cultivate wild animals, organize the production of cashmere and feathers, and carry out the work of collecting horsehair, cattle hair, and cattle down, all can expand resource utilization and increase farmers' income and the wealth of the country.

    农产品采购部全国厅局长会议结束
    农产品采购部从三月二十日到四月五日在北京举行了全国厅（局）长会议。会议着重讨论了改进农产品的收购方法，建立和健全采购机构，研究和扩大农村资源的利用和干部培养教育等问题。会议认识到农产品预购工作的重要意义，今年除继续贯彻执行棉花预购外，还要扩大茶叶、苎麻、烤烟、羊毛的预购。为此会议认为必须及时作好农产品预购合同的签订、复查、履行到最后的清理结算等工作。
    会议认为今年旺季上市的农产品将比1955年增加半倍以上，当前必须积极进行迎接旺季的各项准备工作，如合理分布采购站、组织采购小组和采购人员下乡，以及和农业社挂勾等，以求扩大直接采购。会议还认为做好农产品的初制加工，提高产品质量，保证规格也很重要。这就必须和农业部门密切配合，加强对农民和牧民的技术指导，准确的检验等级，正确执行价格政策，纠正压级压价或提级提价的偏向。
    会议号召各地研究和开辟新的农产资源，达到充分利用。为推广剥制棉杆皮，棉籽脱绒，利用野麻、剑麻、烟杆皮，推广培植二茬烟，增采夏秋茶，加强野茶收购工作，培育野生动物，组织羊绒、羽毛的生产，开展抓马毛、牛毛、牛绒的工作等，都可扩大资源利用，增加农民收入和国家的财富。
