Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: According to a Kyodo News report, the Japanese government's Ministry of Finance decided on April 6th to temporarily refrain from purchasing remaining US agricultural products during the 1955-1956 US fiscal year. The United States had originally proposed concluding a new agreement with Japan to sell surplus agricultural products such as wheat, raw cotton, and tobacco, worth 50 million US dollars, to Japan.

According to the "Asahi Shimbun" report, Japan is dissatisfied with the various demands made by the United States regarding the supply of these commodities and their "excessively high prices." The "Asahi Shimbun" said that Japan is also worried that the import of American products may hinder the sales of Japanese products in the domestic market.

Sources say that the proposed agreement by the United States includes a condition that Japan must use one-fifth of the total price of purchasing surplus US agricultural products to strengthen Japan's military and armaments industry. The remaining four-fifths of the price will be used by the United States to purchase Japanese goods and transport them to Southeast Asian countries. Japan is concerned that this practice will adversely affect Japan's export markets in Southeast Asian countries.

    日本拒购美国剩余农产品
    新华社讯　东京消息：据共同社报道，日本政府大藏省已经在四月六日决定，在1955—1956美国财政年度内暂不承购美国剩余农产品。美国本来建议同日本缔结一个新协定，以便把价值五千万美元的小麦、原棉和烟叶等剩余农产品卖给日本。
    据“朝日新闻”报道，日本不满意美国对供应这些商品而提出的种种要求和这些商品的“过高的价格”。“朝日新闻”说，日本还害怕美国产品的输入可能妨碍日本产品在国内市场的销售。
    有消息说，美国建议中的协定附有条件，即日本要把购买美国剩余农产品的全部价款的五分之一用来加强日本的军队和军火工业。其余五分之四的价款将由美国用来购买日本货物，并且把它们运往东南亚各国。日本担心这种做法将对日本在东南亚各国的出口市场产生不利影响。
