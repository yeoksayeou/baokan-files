Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory
Serious Waste Due to Substandard Products

To the Editor:

The Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory is a large-scale machine oil pressing factory in North China with relatively complete equipment, but the refined cottonseed oil produced by this factory consistently fails to meet the national standards.

In December 1955, 212 tons of refined cottonseed oil shipped by the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory to Xinhe were inspected by the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau and found to be substandard and unsuitable for export, causing serious losses to the country. However, the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory did not learn from this lesson and improve its work. In January and February of this year, another 265 tons of refined cottonseed oil they shipped to Tianjin were rejected by the receiving party due to substandard oil color and sediment. Currently, 1,025 tons of refined cottonseed oil stored by the China Oils and Fats Company Shijiazhuang Branch and the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory cannot be exported because they are substandard.

Why is the quality of refined cottonseed oil from the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory so poor? It turns out that since the fourth quarter of last year, the factory has blindly increased the steaming and frying time of the material in production, raising the material temperature entering the machine chamber to 130 degrees Celsius, which greatly exceeds the national standard temperature. As a result, the oil produced has a poor color and does not meet export specifications. The reason for doing so, it is said, is to reduce the residual oil rate in the cottonseed cake. However, using high-temperature oil extraction not only reduces the fertilizing efficiency of the produced cottonseed cake, but also increases the amount of oil volatilization during the production process. In this way, although the residual oil rate in the cottonseed cake is reduced, the oil yield is also reduced. In December 1955, the average refining loss in the factory's refining workshop was as high as 12.24%, exceeding the prescribed 4.24%, resulting in a loss of 122,740 jin of refined cottonseed oil.

Cheng Lingdai, the resident representative of the China Oils and Fats Company Shijiazhuang Branch, has repeatedly suggested to the leadership of the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory to lower the temperature of the material entering the press, but the factory has consistently failed to pay attention to this correct opinion. It is hoped that the higher-level leadership organs will handle this issue and correct the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory's erroneous practice of reducing product quality and increasing oil loss.

### 石家庄植物油厂  产品不合规格浪费现象严重

    石家庄植物油厂
    产品不合规格浪费现象严重编辑同志：
    石家庄植物油厂是华北地区设备比较完善的大型机器榨油厂，但是这个油厂生产的精炼棉籽油却总是不合国家规定的规格标准。
    石家庄植物油厂在1955年十二月份运到新河去的212吨精炼棉籽油，经天津商品检验局检验不合国家规格，不能外销，给国家造成了严重的损失。但是，石家庄植物油厂并没有接受这个教训来改进工作。今年一、二月份他们运到天津的265吨精炼棉籽油，又是油色不合规格，而且有沉淀物，收货方面拒绝接收。现在中国油脂公司石家庄分公司和石家庄植物油厂所存的1，025吨精炼棉籽油，也因为不合规格而不能外销。
    石家庄植物油厂的精炼棉籽油质量为什么这样不好呢？原来去年第四季度以来，这个厂在生产中盲目增加了料坯的蒸炒时间，料坯入机膛温度增高到摄氏130度，大大地超过了国家规定的温度。于是，炼出来的油油色就不好，不合出口规格。他们这样做的原因，据说是为了要降低棉籽饼内的残油率。但是，使用高温榨油，不但产的棉饼施肥效率降低了，而且在生产过程中油脂挥发量增多了。这样，棉籽饼里的残油率虽然降低了，但是出油率也降低了。1955年12月份内，这个厂精炼车间的平均炼耗高达12.24％，超过规定4.24％，因而损失的精炼棉籽油共计122，740市斤。
    中国油脂公司石家庄分公司驻厂员程凌岱曾经几次向石家庄植物油厂领导方面提出降低料坯入榨温度的建议，但是厂方始终没有重视这个正确的意见。希望上级领导机关来处理这个问题，纠正石家庄植物油厂这种降低产品质量和加大油品损耗的错误做法。
