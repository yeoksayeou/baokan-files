Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 15th: TASS reports: French Prime Minister Mollet received Maurice Thorez, chairman of the Communist parliamentary group in the National Assembly, and Vice-Chairman Roget on April 13th. Thorez and Roget expressed deep public unease regarding the French government's decision to call up reservists. After speaking with Mollet, Thorez and Roget issued a statement saying that the "inevitable consequence" of implementing the decision to call up reservists "will be the deterioration of the situation in Algeria and the continuation of the war."

Thorez and Roget pointed out that a policy of strength cannot promote a peaceful resolution of the Algerian problem. They expressed the hope that the French government "would announce its determination to take the necessary measures to strive for an early start to talks on a ceasefire and on the entire Algerian issue."
