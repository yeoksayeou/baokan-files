Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th (via TASS) - The visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev has become the center of attention for the British press and the widest range of social figures. All Sunday newspapers published the news of Bulganin and Khrushchev's departure for Britain. Many newspapers also published editorials and editor's articles. London Radio also broadcast a summary of the "Pravda" editorial on the visit.

The "Sunday Times" editorial stated that any step aimed at removing obstacles to mutual understanding between Britain and the Soviet Union should be welcomed. The newspaper acknowledged that negotiation is the best way to solve international problems. At the same time, "Sunday Times" and other newspapers' observers attempted to create the impression that the conclusion of an agreement depends solely on the Soviet side. Some newspaper commentators wanted to spread disputes and mutual distrust between the people of Britain and the Soviet Union.

On the other hand, many influential newspaper observers, representatives of social organizations, and ordinary people in Britain expressed a warm hope for success in the current negotiations. They pointed out the great significance of these negotiations for further developing Anglo-Soviet relations and consolidating the cause of universal peace. Ordinary people in Britain expressed their heartfelt welcome to the arrival of the Soviet leaders in their letters, in speeches at gatherings, and in private conversations, and expressed their hope to see Bulganin and Khrushchev, to chat with them, and to invite them for "a cup of tea."

The "Reynolds News" editorial on the 15th regretted that the formulation of the visit's schedule did not take into account the need to allow the Soviet guests to have the opportunity to see the living conditions of ordinary people. The newspaper also regretted that the visit's schedule did not include "any opportunity to understand typical people's organizations such as cooperatives and trade unions," nor did it arrange meetings with ordinary people, workers, trade union representatives, and visits to industrial centers in Scotland and Wales.

    英国各方面人士
    重视苏联领导人物到英国访问
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的访问已经成为英国新闻界和最广泛的社会人士的注意中心。所有的星期日报纸都刊登了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫动身去英国的消息。许多报纸还发表了社论和编辑部的文章。伦敦电台也摘要广播了“真理报”就这次访问发表的社论。
    “星期日泰晤士报”编辑部的文章说，应当欢迎目的在消除英、苏两国相互谅解的障碍的任何一个步骤。这家报纸承认谈判是解决国际问题最好的方法。同时，“星期日泰晤士报”和其他一些报纸的观察家们却企图造成一种印象，似乎协议的达成仅仅取决于苏联一方。有些报纸评论员想在英苏两国人民间散布纠纷和互不信任的情绪。
    另一方面，许多有影响的报纸的观察家、社会团体的代表和英国的普通人们表示热烈希望在当前的谈判中取得成就。他们指出了这次谈判对进一步发展英苏关系和巩固普遍和平事业的重大意义。英国的普通人在自己的信上、在集会上的发言中以及在私人谈话里都表示衷心欢迎苏联领导人的到来，并且表示希望见到布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫，希望同他们谈谈天，邀请他们去“喝一杯茶”。
      “雷诺新闻”十五日在编辑部的文章里惋惜访问日程的制定没有估计到必须让苏联客人有可能看一看普通人民的生活情况。这家报纸还惋惜地说，访问日程中没有列入“对像合作社和工会这样一些典型的人民机构进行了解的任何机会”，也没有安排同普通人民、工人、工会代表们的会面以及对苏格兰和威尔士工业中心的访问。
