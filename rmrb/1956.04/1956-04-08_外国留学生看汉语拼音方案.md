    Foreign Students Look at the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme
    Zhang Wei, Jin Dehou, Teachers of the Chinese Language Training Class for Foreign Students, Peking University
      After the publication of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (draft), the foreign students in the Chinese Language Training Class for Foreign Students at Peking University were very excited. Wang Mingde, a German student, ran to the teacher as soon as he saw the scheme and asked: when can we start using this new alphabet? Students from Yugoslavia automatically started learning the scheme when they saw it, and now they have basically mastered this set of alphabets and are using it in their studies. The training class has recently replaced the Zhuyin alphabet with this set of phonetic alphabets to teach a new batch of Indian students.
    This feeling is easy to understand. From the learning process, foreign students generally feel that the biggest difficulty in learning Chinese is the writing and memorization of Chinese characters. Each Zhuyin alphabet looks like an independent Chinese character, which is completely unfamiliar to foreign students and relatively difficult to accept. The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (draft) adopts a phonemic syllable structure, which saves letters, reduces the burden on students, and is more flexible in spelling. Foreign students feel that the Zhuyin alphabet is inconvenient to write and unclear when written quickly. The use of the Latin alphabet eliminates these shortcomings.
    The reason why foreign students warmly welcome this phonetic alphabet scheme (draft) is not only because it can annotate Chinese characters more accurately, conveniently, and flexibly than the Zhuyin alphabet, but also because it is the best tool for researching and experimenting with the pinyinization of Chinese. Therefore, everyone is looking forward to the pinyinization of Chinese as soon as possible. Indeed, Chinese characters bring a lot of difficulties to foreign students. Zhu Dexi, an Albanian student, said: "Chinese words are composed of individual Chinese characters, so when memorizing vocabulary, I often reverse the words because I pay attention to the shape of individual Chinese characters. For example, '纪念' (jì niàn, commemorate) is remembered as '念纪' (niàn jì, reversed order). It's the same when writing Chinese characters, '晚' (wǎn, late) is written as '?'. Also, because Chinese characters are not phonetic, the shape of the character has no relation to the pronunciation, making it very difficult to remember. So even after studying for so long, there are still many shortcomings in my pronunciation. If pinyin is used, these difficulties will be greatly reduced, so that I will have more time to further improve my Chinese level." He also said: "Even if it is not pinyin today, we can use the pinyin scheme to take notes. This will be of great help to us." Li Ang, a Polish student, plans to return to his country to teach Chinese in the future. He said: If Chinese characters are changed to pinyin, it will be much more convenient for his teaching in the future. Wu He, a Czechoslovak student, also believes that many people in Czechoslovakia want to learn Chinese today, and the publication of the pinyin scheme will definitely reduce the difficulties for the Czechoslovak people in learning Chinese. Therefore, the development of Chinese characters towards pinyinization is not only a major event for the Chinese people, but also good news for people all over the world who are learning Chinese. Hungarian students suggested that if a set of conversational materials could be spelled out with the pinyin scheme as soon as possible and taught to new students, it would definitely enable them to master everyday language faster and better.
    The foreign students are very concerned about the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. Many people have also introduced methods of annotating Chinese characters using letters from their native languages. At the same time, they have also put forward some views and opinions on the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (draft). Chen Yin, a Vietnamese student, combined his experience in the reform of his country's writing system and said: "After the reform of the Vietnamese writing system, those who learn well can read books and newspapers in two months. So I believe that the reform of Chinese characters will definitely achieve good results."
    The teachers of the training class firmly believe that after Chinese characters are changed to pinyin, the teaching effect will be greatly improved. Teacher Xiong Yi said: "When students first come, they can only memorize more than ten words a day, about twenty or so Chinese characters. But in order to remember the shapes of those Chinese characters and write those Chinese characters, it takes more than three hours, and the mastery is not solid enough. Although the teachers have thought of many ways to help the students master Chinese characters, the difficulties are still great. If we use pinyin, the vocabulary accepted by the students will definitely increase greatly. The Chinese level at graduation will also be greatly improved compared to today."

    外国留学生看汉语拼音方案
    北京大学外国留学生中国语文专修班教员　张维　金德厚
      汉语拼音方案（草案）公布以后，北京大学外国留学生中国语文专修班的留学生们都感到非常兴奋。德国留学生王明德看到了这个方案，就立刻跑到教师那儿问：什么时候可以开始用这种新的字母？南斯拉夫同学看到这个方案，就自动学习起来，现在他们已经基本上掌握了这一套字母，并且运用到学习中去了。专修班最近已经用这一套拼音字母代替注音字母教给刚来的一批印度留学生。
    这种心情是很容易理解的。从学习过程中，外国留学生普遍地感觉到学习汉语中最大的困难是汉字的书写和记忆，而注音字母每个字母都像一个独立的汉字，这对外国留学生来说，是一套完全陌生的东西，接受起来比较困难。汉语拼音方案（草案）是采用了音素化的音节结构，这样就节省了字母，减轻了同学的负担，拼写起来也比较灵活。外国留学生们觉得注音字母书写不方便，写快了也不清楚，采用了拉丁字母就没有这些缺点了。
    外国留学生所以这样热烈地欢迎这个拼音方案（草案），不仅因为它能比注音字母更准确、更方便、更灵活地给汉字注音，而且因为它是一个为汉语拼音化进行研究和试验的最好的工具。因此大家更盼望早日使汉语拼音化。的确，汉字给外国留学生带来的困难真不少。阿尔巴尼亚留学生朱得喜说：“汉语的词是由单个汉字组成的，所以在记词汇的时候，常常因为注意了单个汉字的字形却把词记颠倒了。如：把‘纪念’记成‘念纪’。写汉字的时候，也是这样，把‘晚’就写成了‘?’。又因为汉字不是表音文字，字形和读音没有关系，记起来就非常困难。所以一直学习到现在，自己的发音还有很多缺点，如果改用拼音文字，这些困难就会大大减少，从而会有更多的时间来进一步提高汉语水平。”他还说：“即使今天还不是拼音文字，但是我们可以用拼音方案来记笔记了。这对我们也会有很大的帮助。”波兰留学生李昂准备将来回国教中文，他说：汉字如果改成了拼音文字，将来对他的教学一定会有很大的方便。捷克斯洛伐克留学生吴和也认为捷克斯洛伐克今天有很多人要学习中文，拼音方案的公布一定会减少捷克斯洛伐克人民学习中文的困难。所以汉字能往拼音化的方向发展，这不但对中国人民是一件大事，对世界各国学习中文的人也是一个好消息。匈牙利的留学生提出如果能够早些用拼音方案拼写出一套会话材料，教给新来的留学生，就一定会使他们更快更好地掌握日常用语。
    留学生对汉语拼音方案都非常关心，很多人还介绍了用他们本国文的字母给汉字注音的方法，同时对汉语拼音方案（草案）也提出了一些看法和意见。越南留学生陈寅结合他们本国文字改革的体会说：“越南文字改革以后，学习得好的人，两个月就能看书看报。所以我相信汉字的改革，一定也会收到很好的效果。”
    专修班的教师都坚决相信汉字改成拼音文字以后，教学效果将大大地向前推进一步。教师熊毅说：“同学刚来的时候，每天只能记十多个词，大约只有二十几个汉字。但是为了记住那些汉字的字形和书写那些汉字，需要花上三个多钟头，而且掌握得还不够巩固。虽然教师们想了很多办法帮助同学们掌握汉字，但是困难仍然很大。如果我们采用拼音文字，同学接受的词汇一定可以大大增加。结业时的汉语水平也会比今天大大提高。”
