    In Taiwan in Deep Water and Scorching Fire
      Drought and Insect Plagues
    The suffering Taiwanese farmers are now facing severe drought and insect plagues. According to Taiwan newspapers, by mid-April, over 11,000 hectares of rice paddies in Pingtung, Hsinchu, Miaoli, and Taichung counties were suffering from severe drought, with the vast majority not even having had seedlings planted. In Tainan, Pingtung, Chiayi, and Kaohsiung counties, 15,000 hectares of rice paddies were suffering from rice blast and insect infestations. Taiwan newspapers say that Taiwan has experienced severe droughts every year for the past three years, mainly because Taiwan's forests have been heavily cut down by corrupt officials in recent years, affecting water and soil conservation.
    Endless Extortion
    Factories, shops, and households in Taiwan are unable to avoid so-called "military contribution donations" for much of the year. Taiwanese import and export merchants have just paid the 1955 "Foreign Exchange Settlement Military Support Movement" funds, and now comes another round of the 1956 "Military Contribution Donations." Chiang Kai-shek's "Military Friends Society" stipulates that Taiwanese import and export merchants must pay a "donation" of five pseudo-Taiwan dollars for every US dollar of goods imported or exported in this "donation." By mid-April, in Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, and Tainan alone, this "donation" had reached over two million pseudo-Taiwan dollars. In addition, there have recently been so-called "Support the Frontline Expanded Military Support Donations," "One Yuan Military Support Movement," "Ten Thousand Towel Military Support Movement," "Charity Sale of Military Appreciation Flowers," and "Issuance of Military Appreciation Gift Certificates" in Taiwan.
      Increasing Number of Impoverished People Selling Blood
    Large numbers of impoverished people in Taiwan have to sell their blood to make a living. Taiwan newspapers say that more than 10,000 impoverished people registered to sell blood at the National Taiwan University Hospital last year. Due to the large number of blood sellers, supply exceeds demand, and blood sellers are also exploited by a group of "vampires" who extract so-called "convenience fees," accounting for about one-third of the blood selling price.

    在水深火热中的台湾
      旱灾和虫灾
    苦难的台湾农民现在又面临着严重的旱灾和虫害。据台湾报纸统计，四月中旬，屏东、新竹、苗栗、台中四县共有一万一千多公顷稻田发生了严重旱灾，其中绝大部分连秧苗都未插上；台南、屏东、嘉义、高雄四县有一万五千公顷稻田发生稻热病和虫害。台湾报纸说，最近三年来台湾每年都发生严重的旱灾，主要是因为台湾的森林几年来被贪官污吏所大肆砍伐，影响水土保持。
    层出不穷的勒索
    台湾的工厂、商店和住户一年中没有多少天能够避免所谓“劳军捐献”的勒索。台湾的进出口商人刚刚缴纳了1955年“结汇劳军运动”的款项，现在又来了一套1956年“劳军捐献”。蒋介石“军人之友社”规定台湾的进出口商人在这次“捐献”中，每进口或出口一美元商品，就要缴纳伪台币五角的“捐款”，到四月中旬，单在台北、基隆、高雄和台南四市，这项“捐款”已达伪台币二百万元以上。此外，最近在台湾还有所谓“支援前线扩大劳军捐献”、“一元劳军运动”、“十万毛巾劳军运动”、“义卖敬军花”和“发售敬军礼券”等等。
      卖血的贫民增加
    台湾大批贫民要出卖自己的血液来维持生活。台湾报纸说，去年到台湾大学医院登记卖血的贫民有一万多人。由于卖血者众多，供过于求，卖血者还被一批“吸血鬼”抽剥所谓“便利费”，约占卖血价三分之一。
