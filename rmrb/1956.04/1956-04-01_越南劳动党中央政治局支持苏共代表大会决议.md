Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 31st: Today's Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a communique from the Central Political Bureau of the Vietnamese Labor Party.

The communique stated that the Central Political Bureau of the Vietnamese Labor Party had convened a meeting to hear a report from the Vietnamese Labor Party Central Delegation regarding the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The communique stated that Comrades Truong Chinh and Le Duc Tho emphatically discussed the Congress's analysis of fundamental issues in the current international situation, the Congress's clarification of collective leadership and opposition to the cult of personality, and the spirit of criticism and self-criticism at the Congress, as well as the consistency of the Congress and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's line.

The communique stated that after hearing the two comrades' reports, the Political Bureau conducted discussions and fully supported the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The Political Bureau affirmed that the 20th Congress of the CPSU was of extremely important historical significance and believed that the Congress's resolutions would advance the cause of communist construction in the Soviet Union, and at the same time, would illuminate the path for the people of the world to struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and socialism even more brightly.

The communique stated that for Vietnam, the conclusions reached at the 20th Congress of the CPSU have further theoretically armed the Vietnamese Labor Party and clarified the path forward for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These conclusions have made us even more confident that the Party, the government, and the Vietnam Fatherland Front's propositions regarding the struggle to achieve national reunification through peaceful means on the basis of independence and democracy are completely correct.

The communique concluded by stating that the Political Bureau has decided to convene an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee to hear a report on the 20th Congress of the CPSU and has decided to prepare to organize cadres to study the main documents of the Congress in conjunction with promoting all current work tasks of the Party and the government.
