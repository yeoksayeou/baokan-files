Developing Sericulture
    Jiangsu Province: Yizheng, Liyang, Liuhe, Jiangning and other twelve counties have begun to raise tussah silkworms. This year, it is planned to raise tussah silkworms on more than 3,000 mu of land, with a preliminary estimate of over 160 dan of tussah silkworm cocoons. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Shaanxi Province: The first batch of more than 26,000 improved silkworm egg sheets imported from Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces this year has been transported to Xi'an by plane, etc., on the 14th. The second batch is expected to arrive in late April. The local silkworm eggs in the main sericultural areas of the province will be completely replaced by improved silkworm eggs. The average cocoon yield of improved silkworm eggs is about 40 jin per sheet, which is more than 100% higher than the yield of local silkworm eggs. In 1955, the highest cocoon yield of improved silkworm eggs reached 74 jin per sheet. Therefore, this year, farmers have been actively ordering improved silkworm eggs, preparing to raise more.
                (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Zhejiang Province: This spring, the Soviet high-temperature light-sensitive, multi-cycle, thin-feeding rapid sericulture method will be fully promoted in major sericultural areas. The Zhejiang Provincial Special Products Bureau has already held training courses for sericulture technicians, training a large number of sericulture experts from key agricultural producers' cooperatives. Last year, Zhejiang Province promoted the Soviet rapid sericulture method in some areas and generally achieved increased production.

    发展养蚕业
    江苏省　仪征、溧阳、六合、江宁等十二个县开始放养柞蚕。今年计划放养柞蚕三千多亩，初步估计可以产柞蚕茧一百六十多担。（据新华社讯）
    陕西省　今年从江苏、四川两省引进的第一批改良蚕种二万六千多张，已经在十四日上午用飞机等运到西安。第二批预计在四月下旬可以运到。全省主要养蚕区的土蚕种将全部为改良蚕种所代替。改良蚕种平均每张产茧四十斤左右，比当地一般土蚕种的产量高出100％以上。1955年改良蚕种的最高产茧量每张达到了七十四斤。因此，今年农民纷纷订购改良蚕种，准备多养。

    浙江省　今春将在各主要养蚕区全面推广苏联高温感光，多回薄饲的快速养蚕法。浙江省特产局已经举办蚕桑技术员训练班，训练了大批重点农业生产合作社的养蚕能手。浙江省去年曾在部分地区推广了苏联快速养蚕法，普遍获得了增产。
