Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: The Japanese-Chinese Fishery Council delegation, led by Chairman Yamazaki Kinosuke, consisting of ten members, arrived in Beijing today and issued a written statement at the airport. The delegation is in Beijing to negotiate with the China Fisheries Association to extend the validity of the agreement on Yellow Sea and East China Sea fisheries between China and Japan, signed last April. They were welcomed at the Beijing airport by Yang Yu, director of the China Fisheries Association, and other officials.

The delegation's written statement is as follows:

We, the Japanese fishery delegation, are visiting your country at the invitation of the China Fisheries Association to negotiate and extend the validity of the "Agreement Between the Japan-China Fishery Council of Japan and the China Fisheries Association of the People's Republic of China Regarding Fisheries in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea," signed in Beijing last April.

Since the signing of this fishery agreement, we have been extremely pleased that people engaged in fisheries in both countries have been able to fish amicably and engage in production peacefully.

In order to share this joy with the people of the whole country, we have repeatedly requested the Japanese government to quickly restore diplomatic relations between the two countries and to sign a fishery agreement between the two governments. Unfortunately, we have not yet received the consent of the Japanese government. Therefore, we originally wanted to invite your delegation to Japan to hold the second private fishery talks in Tokyo and sign the second fishery agreement. Accepting the invitation of the China Fisheries Association, we have come to Beijing again.

Although our main mission is to negotiate and handle the procedures and methods for extending the validity of the fishery agreement, we very much hope to take this opportunity to exchange views on some issues that need to be improved in the implementation of the agreement based on the experience of the past year, deepen mutual understanding, and enhance friendship.

At the same time, we hope to be allowed to participate in your "May 1st" Labor Day celebrations and visit various places to understand the situation of your country's great construction, so that we can convey it to the fishermen in Japan.

Finally, on behalf of the Japanese fishery industry, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the people of your country for their warm welcome, and express our deep respect for the profound friendship of the China Fisheries Association.

    日本日中渔业协议会代表团到京并发表书面谈话
    新华社28日讯  日本日中渔业协议会代表团团长山崎喜之助等十人今天到达北京，并且在机场发表了书面谈话。这个代表团是来北京同中国渔业协会商谈延长去年四月签订的中日关于黄海东海渔业的协定的有效期限的。他们在北京机场上受到了中国渔业协会主任杨煜和其他负责人的欢迎。
    代表团的书面谈话如下：
    我们日本渔业代表团这次应中国渔业协会的邀请，来贵国访问，以便进行协商，延长去年四月在北京签订的“日本国日中渔业协议会、中华人民共和国中国渔业协会关于黄海东海渔业的协定”的有效期限。
    自从签订这个渔业协定以后，两国从事渔业的人能够友好地进行捕鱼，能够和平地从事生产，这使我们感到万分高兴。
    我们为了使全国人民同感高兴，热烈希望迅速恢复两国邦交，并由两国政府签订渔业协定，曾一再向日本政府提出了要求，但遗憾的是，至今还没有得到日本政府的同意。因此，我们原想邀请贵国代表到日本来，在东京举行第二次民间渔业会谈，签订第二次渔业协定，承中国渔业协会的邀请，于是我们又来到了北京。
    我们的主要使命虽然是要就延长渔业协定有效期限的手续和方法问题进行协商和处理，不过我们很希望借此机会，根据过去一年来的经验，对于在执行协定方面需加改善的一些问题交换意见，加深相互之间的理解，增进友谊。
    同时，我们希望能够允许我们参加贵国的“五一”劳动节，并想到各地参观，了解贵国伟大建设的情况，以便转达给日本的渔民们。
    最后，我们代表日本渔业界对贵国各地人民的热烈欢迎表示由衷的谢意，并对中国渔业协会的深厚友谊表示深切的敬意。
