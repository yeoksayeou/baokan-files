Xinhua News Agency, April 7th. Chiang Kai-shek Navy "Hsien Yang" warship Warrant Officer Electronics Petty Officer Yeh Shou-ch'i, dissatisfied with the enslavement of Chiang Kai-shek's army by American military personnel, found an opportunity to break away from Chiang Kai-shek's army when the "Hsien Yang" was en route from the United States to Taiwan via Japan. He safely returned to Guangzhou City on March 30 and received a warm reception from the relevant departments.

Yeh Shou-ch'i, originally from Fuzhou, joined the Chiang Kai-shek Navy in Qingdao in 1947. He successively served and received training on the "Wu Ling" warship, the Chiang Kai-shek First Shipyard (in Zuoying, Taiwan), and the Chiang Kai-shek Naval Petty Officer School. He also interned in the U.S. Seventh Fleet's destroyer squadron for forty days. He was one of the personnel sent to the United States by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in April 1955 to receive the "Hsien Yang" warship.
