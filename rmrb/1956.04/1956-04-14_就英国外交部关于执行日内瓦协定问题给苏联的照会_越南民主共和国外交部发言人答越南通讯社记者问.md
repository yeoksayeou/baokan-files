Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the British Foreign Office recently published a note to the Soviet government regarding the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. On April 12th, a reporter from the Vietnam News Agency interviewed the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and received the following response:

Regarding the responsibility for implementing the Geneva Accords, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the French government and the South Vietnamese regime, under the supervision and monitoring of the International Commission composed of India, Poland, and Canada, jointly bear the responsibility for implementing the Geneva Accords.

The French government is a signatory to the Geneva Accords. The French government has the responsibility to continue to implement and ensure the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords.

During the negotiation and signing of the Geneva Accords, the South Vietnamese regime was represented by the French government. The South Vietnamese regime, together with the French government, implemented some of the provisions of the agreement. The South Vietnamese regime is the administrative authority in South Vietnam and has accepted some provisions of the Geneva Accords that are beneficial to them. Thus, legally and practically, the South Vietnamese regime is fully bound by the Geneva Accords. The argument of the South Vietnamese regime that they are not responsible for the Geneva Accords because they did not sign the Geneva Accords is unfounded.

On military matters, it is not true that the South Vietnamese army is reducing its armaments. According to the plan of the U.S. military delegation in South Vietnam headed by Williams, the South Vietnamese regime is expanding its regular army to 150,000 to 170,000 men and its security forces to 40,000 to 75,000 men in 1956.

While expanding its army, the South Vietnamese regime has expanded many military bases, such as the Nha Be, Tan Son Nhut, Tourane, and Phu Bai airfields, and has continuously transported new military personnel and new war materials into South Vietnam. The International Commission's fifth working report to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference states that the International Commission cannot inspect ships on the Mekong River and the Saigon Airport.

The South Vietnamese regime's policy of increasing its army and preparing for war is also manifested in declarations inciting a march north, such as the statements of Le Van Ty, Chief of Staff of the South Vietnamese Army, and other generals of the South Vietnamese Army.

In contrast to the South Vietnamese regime's policy of provoking war, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently adhered to a policy of peace. Since the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese People's Army has been working alongside the people in national construction. According to the policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, 50,000 soldiers have been demobilized to date. It is unfounded to say that the North Vietnamese army has increased from seven divisions to twenty divisions.

The British government's note states that the main issue is to maintain peace in Vietnam pending the general elections. It must be recognized that maintaining peace and fulfilling the Geneva Accords are inseparable. In order for peace to be consolidated and lasting, the unification of Vietnam must be achieved through free general elections in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The International Commission, as the body supervising and monitoring the implementation of the Geneva Accords, must have the legal basis of the Geneva Accords in order to complete its task.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that, in the current serious situation, it is essential to reconvene the Geneva Conference with the participation of the member states of the International Commission to discuss measures for the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords. It also hopes that the talks between the representatives of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to discuss the responsibilities and measures for the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords will bring good results, leading to the reconvening of the Geneva Conference.

### 就英国外交部关于执行日内瓦协定问题给苏联的照会  越南民主共和国外交部发言人答越南通讯社记者问

    就英国外交部关于执行日内瓦协定问题给苏联的照会
    越南民主共和国外交部发言人答越南通讯社记者问
    新华社河内12日电　据越南通讯社讯：英国外交部最近公布了关于在越南执行日内瓦协定问题给苏联政府的照会，四月十二日，越南通讯社记者就这一问题访问了越南民主共和国外交部发言人，并且得到以下的答复：
    关于执行日内瓦协定的责任，越南民主共和国政府认为，法国政府和南越政权在由印度、波兰和加拿大三国所组成的国际委员会的监督和监察下是共同负有执行日内瓦协定的责任的。
    法国政府是签订日内瓦协定的一方。法国政府有责任继续执行和保证继续执行日内瓦协定。
    在谈判和签订日内瓦协定期间，南越政权曾经由法国政府所代表。南越政权曾和法国政府一起，执行了协定的一部分条款。南越政权是南越的行政管理当局，并且已经接受了日内瓦协定中一些对他们有利的条款。这样，在法理上和实际上，南越政权都完全受日内瓦协定的约束。南越政权认为他们没有签订日内瓦协定所以对日内瓦协定没有责任的论调，是毫无根据的。
    在军事问题上，说南越军队裁减军备，是不符合事实的。根据威廉斯为首的在南越的美国军事代表团的计划，南越政权在1956年内，正在把正规军扩张为十五万人到十七万人和把保安团扩张为四万人到七万五千人。
    在扩张军队的同时，南越政权扩建了许多军事基地，如：芽班、新山一、土伦、富牌等飞机场，并且连续运进南越许多新的军事人员和新的战争物资。国际委员会给日内瓦会议两位主席的第五次工作报告中，说明国际委员会对湄公河上的船只和对西贡飞机场不能进行检查工作。
    南越政权增加军队和准备战争的政策还在煽动北进的声明中表现出来，如南越军队参谋长黎文斯和南越军队其他将领的声明。
    和南越政权挑拨战争的政策相反，越南民主共和国政府一贯遵循和平政策。从和平恢复以来，越南人民军和人民并肩参加国家建设。根据越南民主共和国政府政策，到现在已有五万名军队复员。说北越军队从七个师增加到二十个师，是没有根据的。
    英国政府的照会说，主要的问题是在等待普选期间要维护越南的和平。必须认为，维护和平和履行日内瓦协定是分不开的。为了和平得到巩固和持久，必须根据日内瓦协定的规定，通过自由普选来实现越南的统一。国际委员会是监督和监察履行日内瓦协定的机构，必须具有日内瓦协定这个法律基础才能完成任务。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，在目前的严重情况下，重新召开有国际委员会成员国参加的日内瓦会议以讨论继续履行日内瓦协定的措施，是非常必要的。并且希望讨论继续履行日内瓦协定的责任和措施的日内瓦会议两位主席的代表的会谈将带来良好的结果，进而重新召开日内瓦会议。
