    Maintaining Peace in the Near East
    On April 17, the Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the situation in the Near East, pointing out the causes of the current tensions in the region and the ways to maintain peace. The Soviet government stated that it would provide the necessary support to the United Nations in seeking methods and means to consolidate peace in Palestine. It also suggested that measures should be taken in the near future, without external interference that violates the will of the Near Eastern countries and the principles of the United Nations, to ease the tension in the Palestine region; at the same time, the just national interests of the parties concerned must be considered, and a consolidated peaceful solution to the Palestine issue must be achieved on a mutually acceptable basis. This statement demonstrates the Soviet Union's consistent stance of respecting national sovereignty and striving to resolve international disputes through consultation. This is the Soviet Union's sincere effort to maintain peace in the Near East.
    The deterioration of the situation in the Near East is caused by certain Western countries piecing together military blocs and pursuing a "policy of strength" in the region. Most of the Near Eastern countries gained independence after World War II. They demand continuous consolidation of their national sovereignty, and the establishment and strengthening of friendly relations between countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence, in order to seek common development and prosperity. However, among the Western countries, some powerful groups are determined to block this historical process. The Baghdad Pact serves this purpose. It is now clear to people that this policy of piecing together military blocs has created division and antagonism among the Middle Eastern countries, created many frictions and disputes, and worsened the relations between Arab countries and Israel. The people of the Middle East call the Baghdad Pact a "symbol of enslavement, hostility and war," which is completely in line with the facts. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Nehru also pointed out: "The Baghdad Pact has in fact created unprecedented and more serious tensions and hostility in West Asia. It has set countries against each other, and I don't know how people can even say that this treaty has brought security and stability to West Asia."
    The escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the most dangerous factors in the current situation in the Near East. All peace-loving people have always hoped that the Arab-Israeli dispute can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. However, some people are trying to take advantage of this dispute to stir up trouble, and even want to send foreign troops into the territories of the countries in the region for military threats, exacerbating the tension. According to Western news agencies, four American "battle-ready" destroyers sailed to the Mediterranean on April 15 "to provide a wider range of bases in the region and conduct regular cruises in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean." At the same time, the United States has increased the number of Marines to the Mediterranean region, preparing to hold landing exercises in Crete. American newspapers revealed that "if the Marines can land in Crete, they can also land elsewhere." Moreover, it is said that in order to "protect" American expatriates in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Second Armored Tank Division has been ordered to move from West Germany to the Near East. These displays of force by the American aggressive forces in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions show that it still dreams of using military threats to intimidate the people of the Middle East. Little does it know that it is counterproductive. It has not intimidated others, but has aroused accusations from American public opinion. Even the American "Chicago Tribune," which is far from being a progressive newspaper, believes that these activities of the United States in the Mediterranean are "provocative."
    In order to find an excuse and basis for foreign intervention, some people are always preoccupied with the so-called "Tripartite Declaration." Recently, although they also advocated resolving the Palestine issue through the United Nations, at the same time, Western news agencies rumored that if the United Nations' "attempt fails," then Western countries will still "take joint action" outside the United Nations in accordance with the provisions of the "Tripartite Declaration." Everyone knows that the "Tripartite Declaration" fundamentally violates the Charter of the United Nations. It is a unilateral decision of colonial countries that the Middle Eastern countries have never recognized. Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser said that the "Tripartite Declaration" is "an intervention and a kind of hegemonism." If we act in accordance with the "Tripartite Declaration," it means that Western countries can avoid the United Nations, exclude the countries concerned, and decide on the Palestine issue only according to the interests of the colonial countries behind the Near Eastern countries. This is of course impossible. If we insist on doing so, it will not only be impossible to solve the Palestine issue, but will only worsen the situation in the region.
    In order to achieve a consolidated peaceful solution to the Palestine issue and to maintain peace in the Near East, consultations must be conducted by the countries concerned in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and the will of the Near Eastern countries. On the other hand, from the perspective of the Near Eastern countries, maintaining peace and security in the region is entirely in line with their national interests. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid military conflicts. All those who care about peace in the Near East will believe that if efforts are made in this way, a peaceful solution to the Palestine issue can be achieved.
    The Soviet government's statement stated that it hopes to work with other countries to promote a peaceful solution to outstanding issues. At the same time, the Soviet government reiterated that it sincerely and wholeheartedly supports the Arab countries' aspirations to strengthen national independence and develop national economies, and hopes to develop international cooperation on the basis of safeguarding the national interests of all peoples. The Soviet statement will definitely play a great role in promoting peace in the Near East. All peace-loving people will welcome this positive expression from the Soviet Union and work together to maintain peace in the Near East and world peace.

### 维护近东和平

    维护近东和平
    四月十七日，苏联外交部就近东局势发表声明，指出了造成目前近东紧张局势的原因和维护这一地区和平的途径。苏联政府表示，它对联合国谋求巩固巴勒斯坦和平的方法和手段给予必要的支持。它还建议，应当在最近期间内采取措施，在没有违背近东国家的意志和联合国原则的外来干涉的条件下，缓和巴勒斯坦地区的紧张局势；同时，必须考虑有关方面公正的民族利益，在互相可以接受的基础上使巴勒斯坦问题得到巩固的和平解决。这个声明表现了苏联尊重民族主权和争取用协商方法解决国际争端的一贯立场。这是苏联对于维护近东和平的真诚努力。
    近东局势恶化的原因是某些西方国家在这个地区拼凑军事集团和推行“实力”政策造成的。近东大部分国家在第二次世界大战以后获得独立，它们要求不断地巩固自己的国家主权，并且在和平共处原则的基础上建立和加强各国之间的友好关系，以谋求共同的发展和繁荣。但是，在西方国家中，一些有势力的集团却一心想要阻挡这种历史进程。巴格达条约就是为这个目的服务的。现在人们已经看得很清楚，这种拼凑军事集团的政策，在中近东国家之间形成了分裂和对立，制造了许多摩擦和争端，使阿拉伯国家同以色列的关系恶化。中近东人民把巴格达条约叫做“奴役、仇视和战争的象征”，是完全符合事实的。最近印度总理尼赫鲁也指出：“巴格达条约事实上在西亚造成了前所未有的更加严重的紧张局势和敌对。它已经使国家互相反对，我不知道人们怎么竟然能够说这个条约使西亚获得了安全和稳定。”
    阿拉伯—以色列冲突的尖锐化是目前近东局势中最危险的因素之一。一切爱好和平的人们始终都希望阿拉伯—以色列之间的争端能够早日获得和平解决。可是有人却竭力想利用这种争端来兴风作浪，甚至想把外国军队开进这个地区的各国领土来进行军事威胁，加剧紧张局势。据西方通讯社报道，美国的四艘“作好战斗准备”的驱逐舰已于四月十五日开往地中海，“以便在这个地区提供更广泛的基地和经常在红海和印度洋进行巡游”。同时，美国又增派海军陆战队到地中海地区，准备在克里特岛举行登陆演习。美国报刊透露，“如果说海军陆战队能够在克里特岛登陆，他们也能够在其他地方登陆”。而且，据说为了“保护”在沙特阿拉伯的美国侨民，美国第二装甲坦克师已奉命从西德开往近东。美国侵略势力对中近东和地中海地区的这些炫耀武力的活动表明它还是梦想用军事威胁来吓倒中近东各国的人民。殊不知适得其反，它没有吓倒别人，反而惹起了美国舆论的指责。甚至连远说不上是进步报纸的美国“芝加哥论坛报”都认为美国在地中海中的这些活动就是“挑衅”。
    为了替外国干涉寻找借口和根据，有一些人总是念念不忘于所谓“三国宣言”。近来，虽然他们也主张通过联合国来解决巴勒斯坦问题，但是同时，西方通讯社又扬言说，如果联合国的“尝试失败”，那末西方国家仍然要根据“三国宣言”的规定，在联合国以外“采取联合行动”。谁都知道，“三国宣言”根本是违背联合国宪章的，它是中近东国家从来都不承认的殖民国家的片面决定。埃及总理纳赛尔说过，“三国宣言”是“一种干涉和一种霸道”。如果按照“三国宣言”行事，那就是西方国家可以躲开联合国，排斥有关国家，并且背着近东国家，而仅仅按照殖民国家的利益来决定巴勒斯坦问题。这当然是行不通的。如果硬要这样作，那末不但不可能解决巴勒斯坦问题，而且只会使这个地区的局势更加恶化。
    为了使巴勒斯坦问题得到巩固的和平解决，为了维护近东的和平，就必须按照联合国的原则和近东各国的意志由有关国家进行协商。另一方面，从近东国家来说，维护这一地区和平和安全，是完全符合它们的民族利益的。因此，就有必要避免军事冲突。一切关心近东和平的人们都会相信，如果按照这种途径去努力，那末巴勒斯坦问题的和平解决是可以实现的。
    苏联政府的声明表示，它希望同其他国家一起来促使悬而未决的问题得到和平解决。同时苏联政府重申，它真诚地和全心全意地支持阿拉伯国家争取加强民族独立和发展民族经济的愿望，并希望在维护各国人民的民族利益的基础上发展国际合作。苏联的声明对维护近东和平一定要起很大的推进作用。一切爱好和平的人们都会欢迎苏联的这种积极表示，并且为维护近东和平和世界和平而共同努力。
