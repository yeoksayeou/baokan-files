Xinhua News Agency, London, April 19th (TASS dispatch): On April 19th, Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Malik, held a banquet at the Soviet Embassy in London for Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain.

Attending the banquet were Eden, Butler, Macmillan, Lloyd, and other ministers of the British Cabinet, Labor Party leader Gaitskell, and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hayter, among others.

From the Soviet side, in addition to Bulganin and Khrushchev, Mikhailov, Gromyko, Kumykin, and Ilyichev were present.

At the banquet, Bulganin proposed a toast to the health of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.

Eden proposed a toast to the health of Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Bulganin said in his speech at the banquet that this visit by the Soviet leaders was a step forward on the road to closer relations between the Soviet Union and Britain and on the road to further easing international tensions. He pointed out that good-neighborly relations had long been established between the Soviet Union and Britain. He then said that this was the first time that Soviet state leaders had come to Britain. We are convinced that this visit will promote better mutual understanding between our two countries and the restoration of friendly relations between them.

Bulganin hoped that the negotiations between the leaders of Britain and the Soviet Union would bring about the necessary results, as expected by the Soviet and British people and the people of the world, and proposed a toast to the successful negotiations of both sides.

Eden thanked Bulganin for his speech on behalf of the entire British Cabinet.

Eden said that we welcome your arrival with sincere joy. Your British friends are prepared to respond in the same spirit to the kind of constructive work that Marshal Bulganin spoke of. If we can achieve positive results during our meeting, then such meetings will become customary in the future, and we will interact with each other more often.

Khrushchev then spoke. He pointed out that opinions within Britain regarding this visit by the Soviet leaders were not all the same. There were those in the Conservative Party and in the opposition Labor Party who supported it, and those who opposed it. Khrushchev said that we believe this situation is very natural, and it does not make us feel uneasy. We are politicians, and we understand that it is impossible to have unanimous opinions on such a complex issue as international relations. Even on an issue like peace, there will be various different views. We, the leaders of the Soviet Union, believe that this visit to Britain will bring positive results.

Khrushchev said that the residents of London received us kindly, and clearly, they hope that relations between our two countries can improve. But we know that some British people do not have any particular sympathy for us. But even among these people, there are not many who hope to resolve disputes by force, and that is the main point.

Khrushchev said that if we proceed from the wishes of the people of all countries who demand peace and a peaceful solution to all disputes or outstanding issues, then our negotiations will be successful.

Khrushchev said, you do not like communism, and we do not like capitalism. But we must live in peace. It cannot be denied that such a great country as the Soviet Union exists, and this country desires peace, not war. As the saying goes, God sends whoever as your neighbor, and you can't just be neighbors with those you like. If we can solve international problems from this standpoint, then reaching an agreement is always possible.

Khrushchev went on to say that I think you will also understand that if you try to put pressure on us, to demand something impossible, then you will not get any results. We do not have any illusions in this regard either. There is only one way out, which is peaceful coexistence. Disputed issues cannot be resolved by war, war can only sharpen these issues.

Khrushchev pointed out that due to the high level of technological development, the planet we live on is shrinking. In the past, it took many days to travel from the Soviet Union to Britain, but now, planes designed by outstanding Soviet designers such as Tupolev—who is also present at the banquet—can fly from Moscow to London in just three and a half hours. Military aircraft fly even faster. Taking intercontinental ballistic missiles as an example, they can cross such a distance in just a few seconds. We have already tested the hydrogen bomb. You are also preparing to test it. Either side knows the power of this weapon. Therefore, people cannot be subjected to danger, and the world cannot be subjected to the danger of wealth being destroyed.

Khrushchev said that we must do everything we should to prevent the outbreak of war, to work to ease international tensions, and to strive to consolidate international friendship and world peace. From this, we can again conclude the urgent need to implement peaceful coexistence.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union does not hope to improve relations with Britain on the basis of worsening relations between Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union hopes to establish the best relations with the United States and other countries with the help of Britain. The Soviet Union does not want others' friendly relations with the Soviet Union to be built on the basis of worsening its own relations with other countries. The development of friendly relations between the people of all countries and between all countries can only be achieved through the path of consolidating world peace and international security.

Khrushchev then raised his glass to the consolidation of friendship between the Soviet and British people.

British Labor Party leader Gaitskell said: We hope that Khrushchev's frank speech will help the success of the talks between the leaders of the Soviet and British governments. If these talks do not achieve constructive results, we will criticize both governments—the Soviet government and the British government.

Gaitskell went on to say that although he is the leader of the opposition party, he wishes the British Conservative government every success in its talks with the Soviet leaders.

The banquet was held in a friendly atmosphere. (Attached picture)

    马立克为布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访英举行宴会
    苏英两国领导人在宴会上讲话
    新华社20日讯  据塔斯社伦敦十九日讯：四月十九日，苏联驻英国大使马立克为布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国在苏联大使馆举行了宴会。
    出席宴会的有艾登、巴特勒、麦克米伦、劳埃德及英国内阁的其他大臣，工党领袖盖次克尔，英国驻苏联大使海特尔等人。
    苏联方面出席宴会的除了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫以外，还有米哈伊洛夫、葛罗米柯、库米金、伊利切夫等人。
    在宴会上，布尔加宁建议为英国女王伊丽莎白二世的健康干杯。
    艾登建议为苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫的健康干杯。
    布尔加宁在宴会上致词说，苏联领导人这次访问是在苏英两国接近的道路上和在进一步缓和国际紧张局势的道路上迈进的一步。他指出，苏英两国之间很久以来就建立起了善邻关系。他接着说，苏联国家领导人到英国来这还是第一次。我们深信，这次访问将促进建立我们两国更好的相互谅解和恢复两国之间的友好关系。
    布尔加宁希望英苏两国领导人的谈判将像苏联和英国人民以及全世界人民所期待的那样带来必要的结果，并且建议为双方圆满的谈判干杯。
    艾登代表英国内阁全体阁员感谢布尔加宁的发言。
    艾登说，我们怀着真诚的喜悦的心情欢迎你们的到来。你们的英国朋友准备以同样精神响应布尔加宁元帅所说的那种建设性的工作。如果在我们这次会谈期间我们能够达成积极的成果，那么这种会谈将来就会成为惯例，我们就会更加经常地互相往来。
    赫鲁晓夫接着讲话。他指出，英国国内对于苏联领导人这次访问的看法不是都相同的。无论是保守党里或反对党工党中间都有人赞成也有人反对。赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为这种情况是很自然的，这并没有使我们感到不安。我们是政治家，我们懂得，对于国际间的相互关系这样一个复杂的问题是不可能有一致意见的。甚至像和平问题这样的一个问题也会有各种不同的看法。我们，苏联的领导人，认为我们这次到英国来访问将带来积极的结果。
    赫鲁晓夫说，伦敦的居民善意地接待我们，显然，他们希望我们两国的关系能够改善。但是我们知道，有些英国人对我们是不抱特别的同情的。但是就是在这些人当中，希望靠武力解决争执问题的人也是不多的，而这是主要的一点。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果我们从各国人民要求和平、要求和平解决所有争执问题或者是悬而未决的问题的愿望出发，那么我们的谈判是会成功的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，你们是不喜欢共产主义的，我们也不喜欢资本主义。但是我们必须和平地生活。不能够否认苏联这样一个伟大的国家是存在的，而这个国家希望的是和平，不是战争。俗话说得好，上帝派来什么人，就跟什么人做邻居，而不能只是同你高兴的人结邻。如果我们能够从这样的立场出发来解决国际问题，那么达成协议就永远是可能的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我想你们也会明白，如果你们企图向我们施加压力，向我们要求不可能得到的东西，那么，那是得不到一点结果的。我们在这方面也并不存任何幻想。出路只有一条，就是和平共处。争执的问题不能用战争来解决，战争只能使这些问题更加尖锐化。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，由于技术的高度发展，我们居住的星球正在由大变小。从前从苏联到英国来需要走好多天，而现在像苏联卓越的设计师图波列夫——他也出席了宴会——所设计的飞机从莫斯科到伦敦只要飞行三个半小时。军用飞机的飞行速度还要大。拿弹道洲际导弹来说，只要几秒钟就可以穿过这样的距离。我们已经试验了氢弹。你们也准备试验。无论哪一方面都知道这种武器的力量。因此，不能使人民遭受危险，不能使世界遭受财富被破坏和毁灭的危险。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们要做一切应该做的事情来防止战争的爆发，致力于缓和国际紧张局势，争取巩固国际间的友谊和全世界的和平。从这里又可以得出关于迫切需要实行和平共处的结论。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联并不希望在英国同美国关系恶化的基础上来改进苏联同英国的关系。苏联希望在英国的帮助之下同美国和其他国家建立最好的关系。苏联并不希望别人同苏联的友好关系是建筑在使它自己同其他国家的关系恶化的基础上。各国人民之间和各国之间的友好关系的发展只有通过巩固世界和平和国际安全的道路才能达到。
    赫鲁晓夫接着举杯祝贺苏英两国人民友谊的巩固。
    英国工党领袖盖次克尔致词说：我们希望赫鲁晓夫开诚布公的讲话将有助于苏联和英国两国政府领导人会谈的成功。如果这次会谈不能取得建设性的结果，我们将批评两国政府——苏联政府和英国政府。
    盖次克尔接着说，虽然他是反对党领袖，但是他祝英国保守党政府在同苏联领导者们的会谈中获得一切成就。
    这次宴会是在友好的气氛中进行的。（附图片）
