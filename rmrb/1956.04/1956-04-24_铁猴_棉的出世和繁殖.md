    The Birth and Propagation of "Iron Monkey" Cotton
    Bifu
    Shaanxi Province has decided to propagate 4,000 mu of "Iron Monkey" cotton seeds this year near Tiemenli Village, Sanqu Township, Jingyang. The advantages of "Iron Monkey" cotton are its short fruit branches, very few "youtiao" (meaning non-fruit bearing cotton branches), resistance to excessive growth, compact plant shape suitable for close planting, abundant flowering, numerous bolls, early maturity, concentrated boll opening, and high lint percentage of ginned cotton (averaging over 38%), which is also suitable for the textile industry. According to local farmers' years of cultivation, the yield of unginned cotton per mu exceeds the local Jingsi cotton variety by more than 25%. The most stable yield of "Iron Monkey" cotton over the years has reached eighty jin of lint cotton per mu, while Jingsi cotton only yields about fifty jin of lint cotton per mu. Therefore, this is a high economic value and suitable for mechanized cultivation of improved varieties. Because this cotton has short fruit branches, and flowering and fruiting close to the main stem, just like a monkey climbing a pole, the local farmers call it "Iron Monkey" cotton.
    The "Iron Monkey" cotton variety was personally selected and bred by Meng Wenxi, a farmer in Tiemenli Village, Sanqu Township, Jingyang County. Unfortunately, Meng Wenxi died of illness last spring at the age of thirty-seven.
    Meng Wenxi was a hard-working and meticulous farmer. From an early age, he was willing to delve into cotton planting techniques. He personally experienced that growing cotton is a labor-intensive job, especially when transplanting seedlings and pinching shoots in June, the sun scorching hot, people squatting in the field "three-folded", sweat flowing. Meng Wenxi thought: how wonderful it would be to breed a cotton that does not need pinching!
    In the summer of 1947, Meng Wenxi discovered a cotton plant in his No. 4 Si cotton field that did not resemble Si cotton. It had short fruit branches and abundant bolls. He only pinched the top bud, but it did not produce "youtiao" or grow excessively. He paid special attention to the growth of this cotton plant. He marked this cotton plant and repeatedly told his mother and wife not to damage it. That year he preserved this cotton plant. The following year, it had propagated to dozens of plants, and then increased year by year, until 1950, it had propagated to six mu. In the autumn of 1952, after the rainy season, the Jingsi cotton planted in the Jinghui Canal cotton-producing area suffered severe yield reduction due to excessive growth and boll shedding, with only about twenty-five jin of lint cotton produced per mu. However, the locally planted "Iron Monkey" cotton did not grow excessively, and yielded more than fifty jin of lint cotton per mu. Since then, the farmers around Tiemenli Village have been vying to exchange for this improved variety through relatives and friends. Last year, farmers in thirteen villages near Tiemenli Village had planted more than 1,000 mu of "Iron Monkey" cotton.
    The "Iron Monkey" cotton variety can be propagated to this day, and Meng Wenxi and the villagers have put in a lot of effort. In the first two years of the selection and propagation of "Iron Monkey" cotton, because it was planted very little, it was inconvenient to use a ginning machine. Meng Wenxi tore out the cotton lint petal by petal and preserved the seeds. Later, when more was planted, in order to maintain the purity of the seeds, he always cleaned the ginning machine thoroughly before ginning. When the farmers of Tiemenli Village spontaneously promoted the propagation of "Iron Monkey" cotton, some personnel from the former Northwest Administrative Committee Jinghui Farm stationed near the village, without investigation and research, insisted that the farmers not plant cotton. At that time, the farmers fought against these conservative ideas.
    Now, Meng Wenxi has passed away, when people mention "Iron Monkey," they mention his name. Meng Wenxi's wife said: "Since 'Monkey Climbing Pole' cotton became famous, our family often has visitors. Last spring, Wenxi fell ill, and the Provincial Department of Agriculture also introduced him to Xi'an for treatment." Now, the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experimental Station has been conducting cultivation demonstrations of "Iron Monkey" cotton in various places, preparing for large-scale promotion in the future. The Ministry of Agriculture has also distributed this cotton variety to many scientific research units for testing in the national cotton variety regional trials arranged this year. The promotion of the "Iron Monkey" cotton variety is becoming more and more widespread. This is the honor of Tiemenli Village and Meng Wenxi. (Attached picture)

    “铁猴”棉的出世和繁殖
    笔夫
    陕西省决定今年在泾阳三渠乡铁门李村附近，繁殖“铁猴”棉良种四千亩。“铁猴”棉的优点是果枝短，极少生“油条” （即不结果的棉枝），不容易疯长，而且株形紧凑，适合密植，开花多，结铃繁，成熟较早，吐絮集中，所产籽棉衣分高 （平均为38％以上），也适合纺织业的需要。据当地农民多年种植，每亩产皮棉超过当年泾斯棉良种25％以上。“铁猴”棉多年来最稳定的产量达到每亩八十斤皮棉，而泾斯棉每亩只产皮棉五十斤左右。所以，这是一个经济价值高并且适合机械耕作的良种。因为这种棉花果枝短，开花结实靠近主干，就如猴儿爬杆一般，当地农民就把它叫做“铁猴”棉。
    “铁猴”棉良种是泾阳县三渠乡铁门李村农民孟文喜亲手选育出来的。可惜孟文喜在去年春天病故了，去世那年才三十七岁。
    孟文喜，是个劳动而精细的农民。他自幼就肯钻研种棉花的技术。他亲身体会到种棉花是件费工的活路，特别是在六月天搬芽掐扭的时候，太阳火燎燎地晒着，人们“三折”蹲在地里，汗水长流。孟文喜就想：要是选育一种不打掐的棉花，那该多美！
    1947年夏天，孟文喜在自己种的四号斯字棉地里，发现了一株不像斯字棉的棉花，果枝短，结桃繁，他只掐过顶尖，却没有生“油条”，也没有疯长。他就特别注意这株棉花的生长。在这株棉花上做了记号，再三嘱咐他的母亲和妻子，不要损伤它。这一年他便把这株棉花保存下来了。第二年，它已经繁殖到几十株，以后又一年一年地增多，直到1950年，已经繁殖到六亩。1952年秋季阴雨过了，泾惠渠产棉区种的泾斯棉，因疯长、落铃，减产很厉害，每亩只产皮棉二十五斤左右；可是，当地种的“铁猴”棉，却没有疯长，每亩产皮棉五十斤以上。从此，铁门李村周围的农民，也都托亲拜友争着挑换这个良种。去年，铁门李村附近十三个村子的农民，已经种植“铁猴”棉一千多亩。
    “铁猴”棉良种能繁殖到今天，孟文喜和全村农民都出了不少力气。在“铁猴”棉选出和繁殖的头一、二年，因为种的很少，不便于用轧花车来轧，孟文喜就一瓣一瓣地撕出棉绒，保存下种子。以后种的多了，他为了保持种子的纯度，每逢轧花时候，总先把轧花车擦刷干净。当铁门李村农民自发地推广繁育“铁猴”棉的时候，驻在这个村附近的前西北行政委员会泾惠农场的某些人员，不加调查研究，硬要农民不种植棉花。当时，农民们向这些保守思想进行了斗争。
    现在，孟文喜去世了，当人们提起 “铁猴”的时候，就提起他的名字。孟文喜的妻子说：“自从‘猴上杆’棉花出名以后，我家里常有客人来访问。去年春上，文喜病了，省农业厅还介绍他到西安去治疗。”现在，陕西省农业综合试验站已经在各地作“铁猴”棉的栽培示范，准备以后大量推广。农业部在今年布置的全国性棉花品种区域试验里，也将这一棉种分发到许多地方的科学研究单位去试验。“铁猴”棉良种的推广，越来越广泛了，这是铁门李村和孟文喜的荣誉。（附图片）
