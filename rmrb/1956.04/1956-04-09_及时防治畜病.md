    Timely Prevention and Treatment of Livestock Diseases
    Recently, livestock diseases have occurred in many areas of Lushan County, Henan Province. In Zhangliang Central Township, draught animals suffered from more than twenty kinds of diseases such as acute cold fire, indigestion, and lung fire. The breeders of agricultural producers' cooperatives led their livestock everywhere to find veterinarians for treatment.
      After discovering this situation, the Zhangliang Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Lushan County took the initiative to contact veterinarians in five nearby townships and quickly extinguished the draught animal epidemic.
    The veterinarians formed a draught animal treatment team and an inspection team; the supply and marketing cooperative's medical department sent people with more than seventy kinds of medicines to the townships along with the doctors to prevent and treat animal diseases, ensuring that there were both doctors and medicines. They went deep into the agricultural producers' cooperatives, propagandizing, preventing, inspecting, and treating at the same time. In ten days, they inspected 2,020 draught animals in thirteen cooperatives in two townships and treated 174 sick animals. As a result, many sick livestock quickly recovered.
    The supply and marketing cooperative sent people with medicines and veterinarians to the cooperatives to prevent and treat livestock diseases, which brought great benefits to the agricultural cooperatives and was supported by the peasants. This method can be imitated by supply and marketing cooperatives in various places.

    及时防治畜病
    近来，河南省鲁山县不少地方发生了牲畜病疫。张良中心乡的耕畜患急寒火、倒食、肺火等二十多种病疫，农业生产合作社的饲养员牵着牲口到处找兽医治疗。
      鲁山县张良乡供销合作社发现这一情况后，就主动同附近五个乡的兽医联系，迅速把耕畜病疫扑灭。
    兽医们组成了耕畜治疗小组和检查小组；供销社医药部派人携带七十多种药品，同医生一道到各乡防治兽疫，做到有医有药。他们深入到各个农业生产合作社，边宣传，边预防，边检查，边治疗。在十天当中，共检查了两个乡十三个社的耕畜2，020头，并且分别给患病的174头牲畜进行了治疗。这样，很多患病牲口很快痊愈。
    供销合作社派人携带药品和兽医一道到社里防治牲口病疫，给农业合作社带来了很大的好处，得到了农民的拥护。这个办法各地供销合作社可以仿效。
