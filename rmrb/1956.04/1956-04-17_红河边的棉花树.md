    Cotton Trees by the Red River
    By Our Correspondent Chen Yongjin

    Many northern farmers, when planting cotton, often think: Wouldn't it be better if cotton could grow into trees and yield more? If it could grow into trees, wouldn't it save us the trouble of planting every year? In some parts of Yunnan Province, there are such cotton trees, which are kapok trees. Yunnan Province is vigorously promoting the planting of kapok trees among the masses. Yuxi Prefecture plans to plant 200,000 mu of kapok in the future. Yuanjiang County, by the Red River alone, will plant 60,000 mu.

    On my second day in Yuanjiang County, Comrade Yang Guanglie from the County Agricultural Guidance Station led me to a plot of land in the County Farm to see the kapok trees. After crossing a small river and walking a few steps, Yang Guanglie pointed to a green field on the side of a sugarcane field and said, "That's where the kapok grows." This doesn't look like cotton at all; it looks very much like a peach orchard in the north. As we approached this cotton field, Yang Guanglie added: "This is a cotton tree, which is also known as kapok." Who would have thought that when our northern motherland is covered in heavy snow, the cotton trees here are blooming with pale yellow flowers, bearing heavy cotton bolls, and spitting out snow-white cotton all at the same time? A comrade from the farm casually picked a tuft of cotton and said, "Look at how long the fiber of this kapok is, more than twice as long as that of northern upland cotton. The Yunnan Textile Factory in Kunming uses a mixture of kapok and upland cotton to spin 42-count yarn, and in Shanghai, they spin 60-count yarn; if all kapok is used, even finer yarn can be spun."

    "How many cotton bolls can a large kapok tree produce?" I asked the comrades at the farm.
    "In the past, we checked one tree with more than 3,000 bolls, let's check again." The young man from the farm casually found a cotton tree and said, "If we check all the bolls on this tree, it will take too long, let's find a branch to check." That comrade walked around the kapok tree, found a branch that was neither too long nor too short, and said, "Let's check this branch." It took a long time to finish checking, and he told me that this one branch had 211 cotton bolls; if the size of the cotton branches on this tree is converted into fifteen branches like this, then the whole tree would have 3,165 cotton bolls. But these are winter flowers, and winter flowers produce fewer bolls, while spring flowers produce more bolls, so let's assume that a kapok tree yields 8,000 bolls a year, and 200 bolls yield one jin of cotton, which is 40 jin. This is for a three-year-old kapok tree.

    Their kapok planting technology is still very poor, and their experience is still very limited. They have not yet arrived at an exact number for how many bolls can be harvested from a single kapok tree. In the past few years of planting, some local people have harvested up to 11 jin from one tree, and the best tree yielded 17 jin. If one tree yields 17 jin of cotton, and each mu is planted with a minimum of 150 trees, then one mu of land will yield more than 2,000 jin. If calculated according to the number of bolls on the kapok tree that the farm comrade checked on the spot, and each mu is planted with 150 trees, then one mu can yield 6,000 jin a year. Because the weather here is hot, insect pests are particularly serious. In addition, the cotton planting technology is still very poor, and the yield of kapok is still very low. The best mu only yields 130 jin. However, they will achieve a bumper harvest as their kapok planting technology improves.

    Party and government leading organs at all levels in Yunnan Province attach great importance to the promotion of kapok. In order to teach the masses how to plant kapok, Yuanjiang County has opened kapok training classes, cultivating many activists, and now the county has planted more than 9,000 mu of kapok.

    In Yuanjiang County, we visited Ganzhuang Township, which grows kapok. The 600 mu of kapok here are planted at the foot of Baisha Fruit Mountain. This land, a barren land, was only reclaimed last year. Wang Yihan, the head of Ganzhuang Township, said: "Promoting kapok is not easy. As early as 1952, three kapok trees were planted on a trial basis in Ganzhuang. At that time, we didn't know how to fertilize, nor did we know how to control insects, and the cotton only bloomed and fruited but did not fluff. Last year, when the county assigned them the task of planting 400 mu of kapok, they reluctantly accepted it. The county ran kapok training classes, and 15 activists from Ganzhuang Township participated in the study. In the training class, they studied the state's plan for developing kapok and learned the technology of cultivating kapok. They also visited Xiaoyan Village, which had the most successful kapok planting. After returning to the township, they promoted the bumper harvest of kapok in Xiaoyan Township to the masses. However, when several agricultural production cooperatives in Ganzhuang were preparing to reclaim land for cotton planting, some people were still unwilling to do kapok work. Some people stubbornly said: "We have planted kapok here, didn't it just bloom and fruit but not fluff?" When studying why the masses were not enthusiastic about planting kapok, He Chaoping from the First Cooperative said: "Some members are unwilling to do kapok work because they are afraid of not getting work points." At this time, the Party branch and the Youth League branch first proposed to the Party and League members to actively reclaim land for kapok planting to support the country's industrial construction. In order to eliminate the concerns of the members, the cooperative quickly solved the problem of recording work points for planting kapok, and the task of planting 600 mu of kapok was quickly assigned.

    Sowing began on June 3 last year. They also carried out warm water soaking before sowing. After sowing, people's worries came again, some people said that the soil on Baisha Fruit Mountain was hard, and they were afraid that seedlings would not grow. Bai Guangming, a member of the First Cooperative, ran to Baisha Fruit Mountain several times a day. Every time he ran to the kapok field, he would dig up the kapok seeds in the soil to see if they had sprouted. Three or four days later, Bai Guangming happily said to the people in the village: "The kapok has sprouted!" The seedlings all emerged in just seven days. The masses of Ganzhuang were anxiously waiting to see if the seedlings would bloom. In early August, the yellow flowers of the kapok bloomed, and people anxiously waited to see if the kapok would fruit and fluff in excitement. In October, the kapok showed buds and fluffed. However, bollworms and aphids came next, and the district committee put forward suggestions for insect control to the agricultural production cooperatives in Ganzhuang, and the whole township bought eight sprayers. When the sprayers were bought, the masses did not know how to use them, so the Party branch organized more than 90 young people to learn how to use the sprayers, and timely prevented insect pests. When I visited Ganzhuang, the women here were picking cotton in the green kapok fields. They proudly pulled the kapok floss and praised the kapok for its long fiber and good texture. The people of Ganzhuang expressed their desire to plant more kapok for the country. (Attached picture)

    红河边的棉花树
    本报记者　陈勇进
    很多北方的农民，当他们种植棉花的时候，常常想着：如果棉花能长成树不结得更多吗？如果能长成树不就省得年年栽种了吗？云南省有些地方就有这样的棉花树，那就是木棉。云南省正大力在群众中推广种植木棉。玉溪专区规划，将来要栽种木棉二十万亩。只红河边的元江县就要栽种六万亩。
    我到元江县的第二天，县农业指导站的杨光烈同志就领我到县农场的一块地里看木棉去了。过了一条小河，走了没几步，杨光烈就指着甘蔗田这边的一块青绿的田地说：“那里长的就是木棉。”这哪里像棉花呢，看起来很像北方的桃树林子。当我们走近这块棉花田的时候，杨光烈又说了一道：这就是棉花树，也就是木棉。谁能想到当我们祖国北方大雪纷飞的时候，这里的棉花树却一面开着淡黄色的花朵，一面结了累累的棉桃，一面吐着雪白的棉絮呢？农场里的一位同志顺手摘了一团棉花说：“你看这木棉的纤维有多长，比北方的草棉长一倍还多。昆明的云南纺织厂，用木棉和草棉混合纺出了四十二支纱的细纱，到上海纺出来的是六十支纱的细纱；如果是全用木棉，就会纺出更细的纱来。”
    “一棵大的木棉能结多少棉桃？”我问农场的同志。
    “过去我们查过一棵有三千多桃，咱们再查查吧。”农场的那个青年顺便找了一棵棉花树，说：“如果把这棵树上的桃子都查完，费的时间太长，咱们找一个枝子来查。”那位同志围着那棵木棉转了一个圈，找了一个不长不短的棉枝，说：“就查这个枝子吧。”查了好长时间才查完，他告诉我这一个枝子长了211个棉桃；把这一棵棉树的大小棉枝折合成十五个像这样的枝子，那么全树就是3，165个棉桃。可是这是冬花，冬花结桃少，春花结桃多，就按一年一棵木棉结八千个桃，二百个桃剥一斤花，就是四十斤。这是三年生的木棉。
    他们种植木棉的技术还很差，经验还很少，现在还没有得出一棵木棉到底能摘多少桃的确切数目。当地群众在几年来的种植中，有的一棵结到十一斤，最好的一棵结到十七斤。按一棵结十七斤棉花，每亩按最少种一百五十棵，那么一亩地就收二千多斤。如果按农场的同志当场查的那棵木棉的桃子计算，每亩种一百五十棵，一年一亩就能收六千斤。因为这里的天气热，虫害特别严重。加以种棉技术还很差，木棉的产量还很低，好的一亩才收到一百三十斤。但是，他们将随着种植木棉技术的提高而获得丰收。
    云南省各级党政领导机关，都极其重视木棉的推广工作。为了教会群众种植木棉，元江县开办了木棉训练班，培养了不少积极分子，现在全县已经种植了九千多亩木棉。
    在元江县，我们访问了种植木棉的甘庄?乡。这里的六百亩木棉，种植在白沙果山脚下。这片土地，一片荒地，是去年才开垦的。甘庄?乡乡长王一罕说：推广木棉可不容易。早在1952年就在甘庄?试种了三棵木棉。那时候，不知道施肥，也不知道除虫，棉花只开花结果不吐絮。去年县里分配给他们种植四百亩木棉任务的时候，他们勉强地接受了。县里办木棉训练班，甘庄?乡有十五个积极分子参加了学习。在训练班里，他们研究了国家发展木棉的计划，又学习了栽培木棉的技术。他们还到了栽种木棉最有成绩的小燕村参观。他们回到乡里以后，便向群众宣传小燕乡的种木棉丰收的情形。可是，当甘庄?的几个农业生产合作社准备开荒种棉的时候，有些人还是不愿干木棉活。有的人固执地说：“我们这里种过木棉不是光开花结果不吐絮吗？”在研究群众为什么对种植木棉的情绪不高的时候，第一社的何朝平说：“有些社员不愿做木棉的活，是因为害怕得不到工分。”这时党支部和团支部先向党、团员提出了要积极地开荒种木棉支援国家的工业建设。为了消除社员的顾虑，合作社很快就解决了种木棉记工分的问题，这样六百亩木棉的种植任务很快就分下去了。
    去年六月三日开始播种了。他们在播种前还实行了温汤浸种。播种后，人们的顾虑又来了，有人说白沙果山的土硬，怕长不出苗来。第一社的社员白光明，一天到白沙果山跑几趟，他每次跑到木棉地里，就扒扒土里的木棉种，看看是否出了芽。三四天后，白光明高兴地对村里的人说：“木棉出芽了！”仅仅七天苗儿都出齐了。全甘庄?的群众又在焦虑地等待着看那些苗是不是开花。八月初，木棉的黄花朵儿开了，人们在兴奋中焦虑着木棉是不是结果、吐絮。十月间，木棉现蕾吐絮了。可是红铃虫、蚜虫接着又来了，区委会又向甘庄?的农业生产合作社提出防虫的意见，全乡买了八架喷雾器。喷雾器买来了，群众不会使用，党支部组织了九十多个青年学习使用喷雾器，及时地防止了虫害。当我访问甘庄?的时候，这里的妇女们正在青绿的木棉田里拾棉花。她们得意地扯着木棉絮，称赞木棉的纤维长、质地好。甘庄?的人们表示要为国家种植更多的木棉。（附图片）
