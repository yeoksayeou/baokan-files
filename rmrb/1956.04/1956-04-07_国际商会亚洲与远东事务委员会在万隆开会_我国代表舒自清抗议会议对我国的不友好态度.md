Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 6th: The Fifth Conference of the International Chamber of Commerce Asian and Far Eastern Affairs Committee opened in Bandung on April 4th. The meeting will last for three days. The purpose of the meeting is to provide entrepreneurs and trade groups in the region with opportunities for personal and group contact.

Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said in his opening speech: "The most important task for responsible figures in the business community of Asian countries is to continue to liberate their people." He said that the political liberation that has not yet been completed is only the first step, "and we must then enable the people of our countries to achieve economic progress, social progress, and welfare; otherwise, political freedom will be empty and worthless."

Sastroamidjojo said that Asia is a rich continent, but its people are poor and often hungry. It is our common responsibility to find ways to eliminate the one-sidedness of our national economies and make them more balanced and modern.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 6th: Shu Ziqing, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the representative of the People's Republic of China, who was invited to attend the Fifth Conference of the International Chamber of Commerce Asian and Far Eastern Affairs Committee as an observer, held a press conference in Bandung on April 5th, and said that the Chinese representative believes that the International Chamber of Commerce Asian and Far Eastern Affairs Committee's invitation to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek elements to participate in this conference is an unfriendly attitude. The Chinese representative has protested to the conference and decided not to participate in the meeting.

Shu Ziqing arrived in Indonesia by plane on April 4th to prepare to attend the meeting.

Shu Ziqing said that upon the invitation of the Asian and Far Eastern Affairs Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, we came to Bandung from Beijing, representing the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a national foreign trade organization of the People's Republic of China, to participate in this meeting. I myself, representing the above-mentioned organization, was also invited to participate in the Third Conference of the Asian and Far Eastern Affairs Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce held in Mumbai in 1954. We came to participate in this meeting with the sincere desire to earnestly implement the spirit of Asian economic cooperation, develop economic and technological cooperation with various countries, and further expand trade ties with countries in the region.

He said, however, when we arrived here, we found that Taiwan had also been invited to participate. I reported to the General Assembly and pointed out to Mr. Bangsall, the Secretary-General of the General Assembly, that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and a province of China. The Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek elements have no right to represent China. We will never tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek clique impersonating representatives of China in any way to carry out political conspiracies and undermine the good relations between the Asian and Far Eastern Affairs Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.

Shu Ziqing said that because we did not receive the General Assembly's guarantee for our legitimate demands, we expressed our regret at the General Assembly's unfriendly attitude. This is not only unpleasant, but also intolerable. Therefore, we have protested to the General Assembly and decided not to participate in the meeting.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" reported today that those representatives who participated in the meeting and fully supported the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference on economic cooperation supported the attitude taken by the Chinese representative. The newspaper pointed out that allowing the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek elements to participate in certain aspects is an attempt to turn this economic cooperation meeting into a political conspiracy.

    国际商会亚洲与远东事务委员会在万隆开会
    我国代表舒自清抗议会议对我国的不友好态度
    新华社雅加达6日电　国际商会亚洲与远东事务委员会第五次会议四月四日在万隆开幕。这次会议将举行三天。会议的目的是要使这个地区的各国企业家和贸易团体得到个人之间的和团体之间的接触机会。
    印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约在开幕式上致词说：“亚洲各国工商界的负责人士的最重要的任务是使他们的人民继续得到解放。”他说，仍旧没有完成的政治上的解放只是第一步，“必须接着使我们各国人民得到经济进展、社会进展和福利，否则，政治上的自由将是空洞的和没有价值的”。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，亚细亚是一个富裕的洲，但是，它的人民却很贫穷，而且经常挨饿，想出办法来使得我们各国的国民经济消除它的片面性，使得它比较平衡和现代化，这是我们的共同责任。
    新华社雅加达6日电　应邀以观察员身份出席国际商会亚洲与远东事务委员会第五次会议的中华人民共和国代表、中国国际贸易促进委员会副秘书长舒自清四月五日在万隆举行记者招待会，发表谈话说，中国代表认为，国际商会亚洲与远东事务委员会也邀请台湾蒋介石分子参加这一次会议，是一种不友好的态度，中国代表已经向会议提出抗议，并且决定不参加会议。
    舒自清是在四月四日乘飞机到达印度尼西亚准备参加这次会议的。
    舒自清说，承国际商会亚洲与远东事务委员会的邀请，我们从北京来到万隆，代表中华人民共和国全国性的对外贸易组织——中国国际贸易促进委员会——参加这次会议。我本人也曾代表过上述的组织被邀参加了1954年在孟买举行的国际商会所属的亚洲与远东事务委员会第三次会议。我们来参加这次会议是抱着要认真贯彻亚洲经济合作的精神，发展同各国之间经济的和技术的合作，进一步扩大与本地区各国间的贸易联系的诚恳愿望的。
    他说，但是，当我们抵达这里的时候，我们发现台湾也被邀参加。我向大会报告，并且向大会的秘书长邦沙尔先生指出，台湾是中国不可分割的一部分，是中国的一个省，台湾蒋介石分子没有权利代表中国，我们决不能容忍蒋介石集团用任何一种方式冒充中国的代表来进行政治阴谋活动，并且破坏国际商会亚洲与远东事务委员会和中国国际贸易促进委员会之间的良好关系。
    舒自清说，由于我们得不到大会对我们的这一正当的要求的保证，我们对大会的这种不友好态度表示遗憾。这不仅是不愉快的，也是不能容忍的事情。因此，我们已向大会提出抗议，并且决定不参加会议。
    雅加达“人民日报”今天报道，参加这次会议的那些完全支持亚非会议关于经济合作的决议的代表们，都支持中国代表所采取的态度。这家报纸指出，某些方面容许台湾蒋介石分子参加，是想把这次经济合作的会议变成一种政治阴谋。
