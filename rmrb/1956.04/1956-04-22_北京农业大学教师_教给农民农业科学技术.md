Beijing Agricultural University's Horticulture Department teachers went to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative's orchard on the 20th to carefully inspect the fruit trees that they personally guided the cooperative members to plant for the first time. The university teachers and this agricultural production cooperative have established a long-term connection for agricultural science and technology guidance.

The teachers who went to the Luodaozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative organized a technical class for the cooperative members starting in March, systematically teaching agricultural science and technology in conjunction with the cooperative's specific production requirements.

Under the guidance of the teachers, the Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative used aureomycin on cotton fields for the first time this year. The teachers, along with university students, also helped cooperative members adopt the Soviet experience of cotton seed smothering treatment to advance cotton field sowing.

More than seventy teachers from six departments of Beijing Agricultural University have established long-term connections with the Hongxing Collective Farm and the Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
