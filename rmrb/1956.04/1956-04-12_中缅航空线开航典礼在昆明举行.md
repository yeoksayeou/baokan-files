Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 11th: The regular air service between China and Burma officially opened today. A silver-gray passenger plane flew from Kunming to Rangoon at 7:50 this morning.

Before the plane took off, a grand inauguration ceremony for the Sino-Burmese air route was held at Kunming Airport.

After the band played the national anthems of China and Burma, Guo Yingqiu, Governor of Yunnan Province, Kuang Rennong, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and Wu La Mao, Burmese Ambassador to China, delivered speeches successively. They unanimously pointed out that the formal opening of air traffic between China and Burma will inevitably further strengthen and develop the friendly relations that have long existed between the two countries in history and have recently developed—especially under the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence established by the Premiers of China and Burma.

After the pilot, Bian Rengeng, reported to Kuang Rennong that everything was ready, Kuang Rennong ordered the take-off. Then, Guo Yingqiu, Governor of Yunnan Province, cut the ribbon, and two Young Pioneers presented bright bouquets to the pilot, Bian Rengeng, and the co-pilot, Zhang Cai'en. Amidst the music, the plane circled the field once at a low altitude, bidding farewell to the more than 700 people who came to see it off, and then quickly flew into the high altitude, heading towards the capital of China's friendly neighbor, Burma.

Yao Zhongming, the Chinese Ambassador to Burma, as well as people from all walks of life in Yunnan Province and Kunming City, Wu Ba Mao, the Burmese Consul General in Kunming, and Gao Hongling, the Consul of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Kunming, attended the opening ceremony today.

    中缅航空线开航典礼在昆明举行
    据新华社昆明11日电　今天，中国和缅甸两国间定期的航空交通正式开航，一架银灰色的客机在今天上午七时五十分从昆明飞往仰光。
    客机起飞前，在昆明机场上隆重举行了中缅航空线开航典礼。
    乐队奏中缅两国国歌后，云南省省长郭影秋、中国民用航空局局长邝任农和缅甸驻中国大使吴拉茂先后致词。他们一致指出，中缅这一正式通航，必然会使中缅两国之间在历史上久已存在和近几年来——特别是在中缅两国总理所确定的和平共处五项原则下，获得了新发展的友好关系，得到进一步加强和发展。
    在机长边人耕向邝任农报告一切已准备停当后，邝任农就下令起飞。接着，云南省省长郭影秋剪彩，两个少先队员向机长边人耕和副机长张才恩献上了鲜艳的花束。在乐曲声中，飞机在晴朗的低空绕场飞行一周，向欢送的七百多人告别后，迅速飞入高空，飞向中国友好的邻邦——缅甸的首都。
    今天中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明以及云南省和昆明市各界人士和缅甸驻昆明总领事吴巴貌、越南民主共和国驻昆明领事高鸿岭等参加了开航典礼。
