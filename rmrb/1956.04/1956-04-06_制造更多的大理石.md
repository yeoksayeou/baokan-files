    Manufacturing More Marble
    Marble is produced on the slopes of Diancang Mountain by Erhai Lake in western Yunnan Province. The Wenbi Village, where the Shan Xiaomin family resides, is engaged in the processing and manufacturing of marble. It is said that they have a history of more than a thousand years of mining marble, with rich mining experience and the technology to identify patterns and process it. They can create stone screens, stone tables, vases, and other items with ink painting-like patterns based on the marble's patterns. They can also process and produce various crystal clear and smooth marble building materials. These products were sold at home and abroad hundreds of years ago.
    This year, more than two hundred and eighty families of the Min family in Wenbi Village have joined the cooperative. They have already made public their inherited technologies and initially exchanged experiences. In the future, they will be able to process and manufacture more of this world-renowned marble.

    制造更多的大理石
    大理石产在云南省西部洱海边上的点苍山，从事加工制造大理石的是山下民家族聚居的文笔村，据说，他们开采大理石有一千多年历史，有着丰富的开采经验和鉴别花纹及加工的技术，能根据大理石上的花纹制成像有水墨画一样的石屏、石桌、花瓶和其它物品；也能加工制作各种晶莹光滑的大理石建筑材料。这些产品早在几百年以前就远销国内外各地。
    今年文笔村的二百八十多户民家族人民都参加了合作社。他们已经公开了世代相传的技术，初步交流了经验。今后将能更多地加工制造这种驰名世界的大理石了。　　　　　（据新华社讯）
