Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th. "Pravda" published an editorial on the 18th entitled "An Important Decision," commenting on the recently released communiqué regarding the termination of the activities of the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform).

    "Pravda" stated that this decision was made necessary to align the methods of contact and cooperation between communist parties of various countries with the changed historical circumstances. This decision is imbued with concern for the further development and consolidation of the international communist movement. It demonstrates that communist parties of various countries, under the guidance of Lenin's famous theory that the organizational forms and working methods of the working class party should be determined by the characteristics of specific historical circumstances, are creatively addressing the question of formulating forms of mutual connection.

    "Pravda," after pointing out the historical role of the Cominform and stating that in the present circumstances, it has become obsolete as a form of contact between communist and workers' parties of various countries, said: For the first time in modern history, the opportunity to prevent new wars and imperialist aggression through the joint efforts of peace-loving countries and peoples has emerged. New prospects for the transition of various countries to socialism have opened up. In this situation, communist and workers' parties of various countries must pay unprecedentedly close attention to the characteristics and conditions of their own countries. Only when communists, while maintaining the character of a working-class party, fully represent the national aspirations and interests of their own people, can they unite all national democratic elements in their own country. Every communist party faces the task of finding paths and forms for advancing towards socialism that fully conform to the characteristics and traditions of its own people, and of guiding the masses along this path.

    In today's conditions, communists face a special task, which is to eliminate divisions in the labor movement and establish the unity of the working class in order to struggle for their immediate interests and rights, and for peace and socialism. Objective conditions for the joint struggle of workers' parties and organizations, primarily the two major factions of the current labor movement, the communist and socialist parties, have now matured. Both sides must take the necessary steps in this regard. Not long ago, the communist parties once again declared their willingness to act in concert with the socialists. They proposed jointly formulating a program acceptable to both parties. To save humanity from new war disasters and to further the development of international socialism, it is imperative to accelerate the reconciliation of all forces in the labor movement, and it is imperative to establish cooperation in order to struggle for the current and ultimate goals of the working class.

    "Pravda" emphasized that the decision to end the activities of the Cominform will undoubtedly be conducive to the completion of the tasks currently facing the international communist movement. Needless to say, ending the activities of the Cominform in no way means weakening the ties between communist parties of various countries. No communist would want to deny the necessity and benefits of contact and cooperation between working-class parties. Close fraternal ties, interest in each other's experiences, exchanging opinions on urgent issues, etc., have always been, and will continue to be, necessary conditions for the work of communist parties of various countries.

    "Pravda" said that it is well known that socialist and Catholic parties, trade unions, and other people's organizations cooperate with each other, hold international conferences and meetings regularly, exchange delegations, establish advisory bodies, and so on. There is no reason to think that communists should be an exception in this regard. On the contrary, due to their complete unity of interests and worldviews, closer contact and cooperation should be their characteristic.

    "Pravda" expressed its belief that after the end of the Cominform's activities, communist parties of various countries will find new and effective forms for their mutual contact and for coordinating their activities in the struggle to defend the interests of the working class and to strive for world peace.

    "Pravda" concluded by saying that the great principle of proletarian internationalism, which unites the working classes of all countries into a powerful force for lasting peace, democracy, and socialism, will continue to guide the communist parties of all countries. The world communist movement is today's great progressive movement. More and more working people around the world are uniting around the great banner of communism. Communist parties of various countries, with about 30 million members, have achieved victories in the past and are now achieving victories due to their loyalty to the great Leninist doctrine that illuminates the path of liberation for working humanity. Under the guidance of Lenin's doctrine, communist parties of various countries will achieve new successes in politically and organizationally strengthening their ranks, in expanding their ties with the masses, and in uniting all forces of the working class and different strata of the people to strive for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    “重要的决定”
    “真理报”评结束情报局活动的公报
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”在十八日发表了编辑部的题为“重要的决定”的文章，评论刚刚发表的关于结束共产党和工人党情报局的活动的公报。
    “真理报”说，这个决定的作出是由于有必要使各国共产党之间的联系和合作的方式符合于已经改变了的历史情况。这个决定充满了对进一步发展和巩固国际共产主义运动的关切。它表明，各国共产党在列宁的关于工人阶级政党的组织形式和工作方法要看具体历史情况的特点而定的这一著名理论的指导下，创造性地对待关于制定相互联系的形式的问题。
    “真理报”在指出了情报局的历史作用，以及在目前情况下它作为各国共产党和工人党的联系形式已经过时了以后说：在现代历史中已经第一次出现了通过爱好和平的国家和民族的共同努力来防止新战争和帝国主义侵略的机会。各个国家向社会主义过渡的新的前景已经打开了。在这种情况下，各国共产党和工人党必须空前未有地十分注意自己国家的特点和本国条件。只有当共产党人在保持工人阶级政党本色的同时又充分代表本国人民的民族愿望和利益的时候，他们才能团结自己国家的一切民族民主分子。每一个国家的共产党都面对着一个任务：找出充分符合本国人民的特点和传统的向社会主义前进的道路和形式，并且引导群众沿着这条道路前进。
    在今天的条件下，共产党人面临着特殊的任务，这就是消灭劳工运动中的分裂，建立工人阶级的团结，以便为争取自己的切身利益和权利、为争取和平和社会主义而斗争。工人的政党和组织，首先是当今工人运动的两大派别共产党和社会党，一道共同奋斗的客观条件现在已经成熟了。双方都必须在这方面采取必要的步骤。不久以前，共产党曾经再一次宣布它们愿意同社会党人一致行动。它们建议共同制定两党都可以接受的纲领。为了拯救人类免受新的战祸，为了进一步发展国际社会主义，都迫切需要加速工人运动的一切队伍的和好，都迫切需要建立合作，以便为实现工人阶级当前的和最后的目的而斗争。
    “真理报”着重指出：关于结束情报局的活动的决定毫无疑问将有利于国际共产主义运动在目前所面临的任务的完成。不用说，结束情报局的活动绝不意味着各国共产党之间的联系的削弱。没有一个共产党人会想要否认工人阶级政党之间的联系和合作的必要和好处。密切的兄弟般的联系、对彼此经验的兴趣、就迫切问题交换意见等等，一向是、而且将来也是各国共产党工作的必要条件。
    “真理报”说，大家知道，社会党和天主教党派，工会和其他人民团体相互之间是进行合作的，是定期举行国际大会和会议、互派代表团、建立谘询机构等等的。没有理由认为共产党在这一方面应该是例外。相反，由于它们的利益和世界观的完全一致，更加密切的联系和合作应该是它们的特点。
    “真理报”表示相信在情报局结束活动以后，各国共产党将为它们的相互联系和在保卫工人阶级利益和争取世界和平的斗争中为它们的活动的配合找到新的有效的形式。
    “真理报”最后说，把各国工人阶级团结成为一支争取持久和平、民主和社会主义的强大力量的无产阶级国际主义伟大原则，将继续指导各国共产党。世界共产主义运动是今天的伟大进步运动。全世界越来越多的劳动人民正在团结在共产主义的伟大旗帜的周围。拥有三千万左右的党员的各国共产党由于忠于伟大的列宁的照耀着劳动人类解放道路的学说，过去已经取得了胜利，而且现在也在取得胜利。各国共产党在列宁的学说的指导下，在政治上和组织上加强他们的队伍方面，在扩大他们同群众的联系方面，在把工人阶级的一切队伍和不同阶层的人民团结起来以争取和平、民主和社会主义方面，将取得新的成就。
