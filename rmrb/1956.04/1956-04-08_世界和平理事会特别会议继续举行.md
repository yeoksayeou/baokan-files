Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm: The special meeting of the World Peace Council continued on the morning of April 6th, chaired by Professor Leopold Infeld (Poland).

	Professor Brandweiner (Austria), an international law professor, was the first to speak on the issue of neutrality. He pointed out that Austria's neutrality is of great significance for safeguarding peace in Europe. He also pointed out that the Austrian government's decision to participate in the Council of Europe, which supports the policies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is inconsistent with its obligation to remain neutral.

	Pastor Grüber (German Democratic Republic) spoke about the special significance of disarmament for the unification of Germany. He supported the proposal to establish a region in Europe, including both parts of Germany, where armaments should be limited and inspected.

	The Polish writer Iwaszkiewicz emphasized that at present, no political or economic considerations can justify the expansion of armaments. He called on the peace movement to engage in the broadest cooperation with other peace-loving forces to strive for the peaceful coexistence of all nations.

	Monica Felton (Great Britain) stated that the issue of disarmament is primarily a matter of trust. Public opinion should now create an atmosphere of trust.

	Speaking next, Ehrenburg said: The Soviets have consistently advocated disarmament and consistently demanded the prohibition of nuclear weapons. We believe that all nations are concerned about reducing armaments, and the prohibition of nuclear weapons is in the interest of all mankind.

	Ehrenburg continued, newspapers around the world do not conceal the fact that the current favorable turn in the disarmament issue is due to the pressure of world public opinion. We should call on the public of all countries to support the desire to reach a disarmament agreement and do everything possible to oppose attempts to delay the resolution of this major issue.

	Also speaking at the morning session were Icelandic representative Tomasdottir, Professor Nadzhakov, Vice President of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, French parliamentarian Dreyfus-Schmidt, Simonsen from Denmark, General Secretary of the International Organization of Journalists, Knobloch (Czechoslovakia), and McGair, Secretary-General of the British Christian organization "British Fellowship of Reconciliation," who was invited to attend the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm: The evening session of the World Peace Council special meeting on April 6th was chaired by Eugénie Cotton.

	Reverend James (Australia) pointed out in his speech that the atomic and thermonuclear weapons tests that the United Kingdom and the United States are about to conduct in the Pacific region have dangerous consequences for the people of Australia. He said that Australian peace advocates have launched a struggle to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and 350,000 people nationwide have signed petitions against the threat of atomic war.

	Jordanian parliamentarian Abdul Kader Sali spoke about the Jordanian people's struggle for independence and against the imperialists' conspiracies in the Near East. He vehemently condemned the colonialist policies of Western countries. He said that Jordan rejects the Baghdad Pact.

	Also speaking at the meeting were French Professor Jacques Chatenet, Isabelle Blume from Belgium, French lawyer Bruggita, General Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Jacques Denis, Bowal from Belgium, Chilean parliamentarian Ahumada, and Maius, a representative of Israeli peace activists.

    第一个发言的国际法教授布兰德魏纳
  （奥地利）讲到中立问题。他指出，奥地利的中立对保卫欧洲和平具有重大的意义。他也指出了，奥地利政府决定参加赞成北大西洋集团政策的欧洲委员会，同它保持中立的义务是相矛盾的。
    格鲁柏牧师（德意志民主共和国）在发言中谈到裁军问题对德国统一所具有的特别的意义。他赞成在欧洲设立一个包括德国两部分在内的军备应该受到限制和检查的地区的建议。

    蒙尼卡·费尔顿（英国）发言说，裁军问题首先是一个信任问题。现在舆论的力量就应当创造信任气氛。
    接着发言的爱伦堡说：苏联人一贯拥护裁军，一贯要求禁止核子武器。我们相信，各国人民都关心裁减军备，禁止核子武器是符合全人类的要求的。
    爱伦堡继续说，全世界报纸都不掩饰：目前裁军问题所以有了比较有利的转折，是因为世界舆论的压力。我们应当号召各国公众支持要求达成裁军协议的意愿，并且尽力反对拖延解决这个重大问题的企图。

    约旦议会议员阿卜杜勒·卡德尔·萨利谈到约旦人民为争取独立、反对帝国主义者在近东的阴谋而进行的斗争。他激烈指责西方国家的殖民主义政策。他说，约旦拒绝巴格达条约。
