    Let the Cooperative Members Be Masters of Their Own Affairs
    He Cheng
    A staff member of Baicuo Township in Shahe County, Hebei Province, took the liberty of borrowing more than 500 yuan in cash from the agricultural producers' cooperative. Some cooperative members, upon learning of this, expressed their dissatisfaction, saying: "We are not afraid of not increasing production, but we are afraid of not having the power!"
    Some cooperative members in Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, also worried that after the establishment of large-scale advanced cooperatives, the collective property of the cooperative would be too large and the management personnel would not be able to keep track of it, fearing that they would not receive dividends in the autumn.
    These cooperative members' dissatisfaction and worries are completely justified. Now, the vast majority of cooperative members believe that joining a cooperative will definitely increase production. However, many people fear that their labor fruits will be squandered by the cooperative's leaders and that their income will not increase.
    In many cooperatives, the cooperative members have not expressed their dissatisfaction yet; however, this does not mean that every cooperative member is not worried.
    In the high tide of the socialist revolution, some cooperative members did not realize that some unreasonable things in the cooperative were unreasonable for a while; some cooperative members, encouraged by political enthusiasm, did not speak out even if they felt that some things were not quite reasonable; they completely trusted the cooperative director, and they did whatever the cooperative director said. In this situation, some cooperative staff members easily form a paternalistic style of leadership and do not believe in the wisdom of the masses.
    This is dangerous. On the surface, the work may proceed smoothly for a period of time. However, one of the most obvious consequences is that cooperative members cannot fully utilize their enthusiasm and creativity. Some cooperative members said: "The greatest benefit of joining the cooperative is that I don't have to worry about anything. If the sky falls, the cooperative cadres will hold it up. I will do whatever they tell me to do, without using my brain." Some cooperative members have developed a dependency mentality, unwilling to invest money, unwilling to offer opinions when they see unreasonable things, and even less willing to actively think of ways to do the work better. On the other hand, it is also possible that the cooperative staff members will have great power, act arbitrarily, inevitably make some mistakes, and some people may even fall into the quagmire of corruption and degeneration.
    The best way to prevent these dangers and protect the ideological health of the cooperative staff members is to implement democratic management in production and finance, so that the cooperative members truly have the power to supervise and manage the cooperative affairs.
    Some staff members of the Qianjin Tenth Agricultural Cooperative in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, spent money recklessly. When the cooperative members found out, they proposed that "major expenditures in the cooperative should be discussed by the cooperative members." The management committee accepted this suggestion and organized the teams to discuss the annual financial plan, revised the original plan with excessive expenditures, which could save nearly 20,000 yuan, and the tasks were not reduced; the cooperative members' enthusiasm for production was also improved.
    An extremely important condition for running agricultural producers' cooperatives well is to make every cooperative member truly feel that he or she is the true master of the cooperative.
    In places where democratic management has not yet been implemented, let the masses of cooperative members be the masters of their own affairs as soon as possible!

### 让社员当家作主

    让社员当家作主
    何成
    河北沙河县白错乡的一个工作人员，擅自借用了农业生产合作社的现金五百多元。一些社员知道了，不满意地说：不怕不增产，就怕没有权！
    山西潞安县有些合作社的社员在办了大型的高级社以后，也担心社里公共财产多，管理人员弄不清，担心秋后分红落了空。
    这些社员的不满和担心完全有道理。现在，绝大多数社员都相信办了合作社一定能增加生产量。可是，不少人却怕他们的劳动果实被社里的领导人员胡花乱用，不能增加收入。
    在很多合作社里，社员现在并没有表示出来不满；可是，这并不能说明每个社员都不担心。
    在社会主义革命的高潮中，有些社员看到社里的一些不合理的事情，一时还感觉不到不合理；有些社员在政治热情鼓舞下，即使觉得有些事情不太合理，也不说话；他们对于社主任完全信任，社主任说怎么办就怎么办。在这种情况下，有些社的工作人员很容易形成家长式的领导作风，不相信群众的智慧。
    这样下去是危险的。表面看，在一段时间内，工作可能进行得还顺利。可是，最明显的后果之一是使社员不能充分发挥积极性和创造性。有的社员说：“入了社最大的好处就是不要我烦心，天塌下来有社干部顶着，叫我干什么我就去干什么，不用费脑筋。”有的社员产生了依赖思想，有钱不愿投资，看到不合理的事情也不提意见，更不肯主动地想主意把工作做得更好。另一方面也可能产生这种情况，就是社的工作人员大权在握，独断专行，难免犯一些错误，有的人还可能掉到贪污腐化的泥坑里去。
    预防这种种危险和保护社的工作人员的思想健康的最好的办法是在生产上、财务上都实行民主管理，使社员真正有权监督和管理社务。
    湖北新洲县前进第十农业合作社的一部分工作人员乱花钱，社员知道了，提出“社内重大开支应该由社员讨论”。管委会接受了这个意见，组织各队讨论了全年的财务计划，对原定的开支过大的计划作了修改，可节省近两万元，而事情并没有少办；社员的生产积极性也提高了。
    办好农业生产合作社的一个极其重要的条件，就是使每个社员都确实感觉到自己是合作社的真正的主人。
    在还没有实行民主管理的地方，快些让社员群众当家作主吧！
