The 510 workshop is a major workshop of the Shenyang Chemical Plant. Many factories across the country that produce paper, pigments, and oils rely on it for caustic soda. For a long time in the past, it was the most backward workshop in the entire plant. In the workshop, evaporators, preheaters, and operating tables were covered in a white film of soda. Alkaline water dripped continuously from thousands of pipe switches. The caustic soda lost in this way amounted to about one hundred tons per month, so that the plan could not be fully completed month after month. More than half of the plant's energy was spent on this workshop, but the problem of soda loss could not be fundamentally solved.

Now, the appearance of the 510 workshop has changed. The evaporation section has continuously set new records, with a daily output of 47 tons, an increase of 14% over the plan. The alkali loss rate has been reduced from 11% to 2.72%. The average daily output of each set of evaporators has increased from 15 tons in the second quarter of last year to more than 22 tons at present, far exceeding the designed quota of 12 tons. The steam consumption quota has also been reduced from more than 7 tons in the third quarter of last year to more than 5 tons at present. Now, when you walk into the workshop again, you can no longer see the "white film."

The transformation of the 510 workshop is mainly due to learning advanced experience and establishing advanced thinking.

Before the first half of 1955, the problem of alkali loss had not been solved because a strict concept of saving was not established among the masses. Only dealing with the symptom, the problem persisted. Later, the newspaper introduced the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's medium plate mill in promoting team accounting. The leaders of the chemical plant were inspired and organized the 510 workshop to carry out a labor competition centered on team accounting. They meticulously calculated every detail, used facts to criticize the erroneous ideas of the workers, such as "It doesn't matter if a little bit spills or drips!" and established a strict concept of saving "many grains make a loaf," and launched a mass campaign to eliminate any losses. Workers volunteered to help workers on duty to repair equipment after get off work, repairing thousands of switches within a few days. The alkali spilled on the ground, even a tiny bit, was recovered by the workers into the evaporators.

After the problem of alkali loss was basically solved, the question of how to reduce steam consumption arose. At that time, the steam required to evaporate one ton of alkali was 13.9 tons (the national quota was 12 tons). They adopted technical measures and changed the old-style evaporators from single-effect to double-effect evaporation, reducing the steam consumption quota by half. Next, they promoted the advanced experience of washing salt with hot water and learned from the experience of the Jinxi Chemical Plant in installing special salt extractors, which further reduced steam consumption, and the output steadily increased step by step.

In October last year, the workshop leadership found that production management was lagging behind, so they tried to send the deputy director of the workshop, the duty director, and the foreman to the 511 workshop to learn advanced production management experience. After returning to the workshop, they conducted a special summary, and combined with the experience of the Sixth Petroleum Plant in establishing a patrol inspection system, improved the workshop's production management system, and overcame the chaos in production management. They also strengthened specific leadership over the work of establishing advanced thinking and promoting advanced experience. In response to the inconsistent operating methods of each shift, they studied the characteristics of each shift's operation through production meetings, summarized a set of advanced operating methods, and formulated unified operating procedures. Subsequently, Wang Deyin's advanced operating experience was promoted, increasing the daily output of each group from more than 18 tons to more than 19 tons.

At this time, departmentalism, which hindered the promotion of advanced experience and further improvement of production, began to be exposed. Some people, in order to take advantage of the public, used methods that violated operating procedures to fraudulently obtain excess bonuses. Liu Jingchun, the salt extraction operator of the third shift, saw that the concentration of the alkali liquid in the evaporator had reached 600 grains and could be discharged with alkali soon, when it was almost time to hand over the shift. According to the operating procedures, it should have been handed over to the next shift to complete, but in order to increase the output of his shift and earn more piece-rate wages, he colluded with the evaporator worker Long Zaihai to cheat. They secretly poured out part of the alkali liquid from the evaporator as semi-finished products of the shift, and added dilute alkali liquid to the evaporator, directly endangering the completion of the workshop's production tasks.

Through Liu Jingchun's typical facts, combined with the question of how to ensure the early completion of the Five-Year Plan, the workshop party branch made the workers realize the truth that "one rat spoils the whole pot of soup," and mobilized the masses to expose a large number of "open secrets" that workers in the past had "tacitly understood." Those with serious mistakes were punished, and those with a strong overall concept were commended, suppressing the evil atmosphere, promoting the righteous atmosphere, and establishing a normal production order. Next, a production competition was launched between workers of the same type of work, and the main effort was used to help the weak links in the workshop, so that the backward could catch up with the advanced. In this way, the third shift, which originally had a more serious problem of departmentalism, became the best shift again in January of this year.

### 510车间变样了

    510车间变样了
    本报记者　袁良
    510车间是沈阳化工厂的一个主要车间，全国好多造纸、颜料、油脂等工厂，都靠它供应火碱。在过去很长时期内，它一直是全厂最落后的车间。车间里，蒸发缶、预热缶、操作台上到处是白花花的一片，在上千的管道开关上，碱水滴滴??地漏个不停。这样损失掉的火碱每月就有一百吨左右，以致月月不能全面完成计划。厂部一半以上的精力都花在这个车间里，也不能根本解决碱的损失问题。
    现在，510车间的样子变了。蒸发工段连续创造新纪录，日产量达到四十七吨，比计划提高14％。碱损失率已经从11％降低到2.72％。每组蒸发缶的日产量平均由去年第二季度的十五吨，提高到目前的二十二吨多，把十二吨的设计定额远远抛在后面。蒸汽定额也由去年第三季度的七吨多降到目前的五吨多。现在再走进车间去，看不见“白花花一片”了。
    510车间的转变，主要是因为学习了先进经验，树立了先进思想。
    1955年上半年以前，因为没有在群众中树立严格的节约观念，只是头痛医头，脚痛医脚，碱损失的问题一直没能解决。后来，报纸上介绍了鞍山钢铁公司中板厂推行班组核算的经验，化工厂领导上得到了启示，组织510车间开展了以班组核算为中心的劳动竞赛。他们一点一滴地算细账，用事实批判了职工中“洒一点、掉一滴没关系！”等错误思想，树立了“积腋成裘”的严格节约观念，掀起了消灭点滴损失的群众性的活动。下了班的工人主动帮助在班工人检修，几天内就把数千个开关修好。洒在地下的碱，那怕是一星半点，工人们都回收到缶里去。
    碱损失的问题基本解决以后，又出现了如何降低蒸汽定额的问题。那时候每蒸发一吨碱所需要的蒸汽是13.9吨（国家定额是十二吨）。他们采取技术措施，在老式蒸缶上改单效为双效蒸发把蒸汽定额降低了一半。接着，他们又推广了热水洗盐的先进经验，学习了锦西化工厂安装专门的取盐器的经验，使得蒸汽定额进一步降低，产量稳定地逐步上升。
    去年10月，车间领导上发现生产管理赶不上去，就努力派车间副主任、值班主任和工长到511车间去，学习先进的生产管理经验，回到车间后进行了专题总结，又结合学习石油六厂建立巡回检查制度的经验，健全了车间生产管理制度，克服了生产管理上的混乱。他们又加强了对树立先进思想，推广先进经验工作的具体领导。针对各班操作方法不统一的情况，通过生产会议研究各班操作的特点，总结出一套先进的操作方法，制定为统一的操作规程。随后又推广了王德印的先进操作经验，使每组日产量由十八吨多提高到十九吨多。
    这时，阻碍推广先进经验，阻碍生产进一步提高的本位主义思想开始暴露出来。有的人为了讨公家便宜，用破坏操作规程的办法骗取超额奖金。第三班采盐主手刘景春在快要交班的时候，看见蒸发缶里碱液的浓度已经达到六百颗粒，马上就可以出碱了。按照操作规程，应该交给下一班去完成，但是他为了增加本班的产量，多得计件工资，便跟蒸发工龙在海共同作弊，把缶里的碱液偷偷倒出一部分，作为本班生产的半成品，又向缶内加进了稀的碱液，直接危害到车间生产任务的完成。
    车间党支部通过刘景春的典型事实，结合如何保证提前完成五年计划的问题，使工人群众认识到“一个老鼠坏一锅汤”的道理，发动群众大量揭发过去工人中“心照不宣”的“公开的秘密”。处分了错误严重的，表扬了整体观念强的职工，压倒了邪气，发扬了正气，建立了正常的生产秩序。接着开展了同工种生产竞赛，并且用主要力量帮助车间内的薄弱环节，让落后赶上先进。这样，原来本位主义思想比较严重的第三班，在今年一月份又变成最好的一个班了。
