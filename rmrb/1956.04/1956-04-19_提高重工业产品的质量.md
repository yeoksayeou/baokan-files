    Improve the Quality of Heavy Industrial Products
    In the past few years, the quality of China's heavy industrial products has generally improved and increased. The quality of some products has reached or approached advanced international levels, meeting the needs of national construction to a certain extent. However, poor product quality remains a relatively common and serious problem in various heavy industrial sectors. Last year, steel enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry produced 30,000 tons of waste steel ingots and 20,000 tons of waste steel materials. Some steel rails and steel plates leaving the factory contained impurities. In the Shenyang area, state-owned machinery factories scrapped 10,000 tons of pig iron and 200 tons of non-ferrous metals last year due to substandard castings. Some machinery factories produced products with poor performance, low efficiency, and short lifespans. Since the beginning of this year, the situation of poor quality has not improved significantly, and in some cases has even regressed. The gangue content of raw coal from the Anjiatan Mine and Chengzi Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau is higher than in the past. Quickly reversing this situation and ensuring and improving product quality is the current urgent task of various heavy industrial departments.
    Improving the quality of heavy industrial products is a fundamental issue in realizing socialist industrialization in our country. Increasing the output of heavy industry and increasing the proportion of heavy industry's output value in the national economy are only one aspect of realizing socialist industrialization. More importantly, to make our country a highly industrialized country, we must be able to independently manufacture all the products we need. The vast majority of these products that we must gradually learn to manufacture are those that we have not manufactured in the past, and the quality requirements are very strict. Even for those that we have manufactured in the past, the quality requirements have been greatly improved. In order to manufacture these products, we must have high-quality raw materials and precise manufacturing machinery. The products produced must also meet quality standards. If we cannot meet these requirements, we cannot guarantee the speed of industrial development, nor can we guarantee true technological independence.
    The reason why the quality problem of heavy industrial products now appears particularly prominent is not that the work of the heavy industrial sector has lagged behind or that it is paying less attention to quality in recent years. In recent years, we have begun to independently manufacture a large number of new-style machines of Soviet and People's Democratic countries' models and specifications, and steel and chemical industry products have also widely adopted Soviet national standards. However, these new types of products represent the world's most advanced technical and scientific level, and the technical requirements are very high. The original industrial enterprise foundation in our country is backward, and it is not adapted in terms of machinery and equipment, production organization, and the technical operational level of workers. This makes the phenomenon of low product quality increasingly prominent. Therefore, in order to improve the quality of heavy industrial products, it is necessary to technically transform the old enterprises comprehensively and systematically, and strengthen technical management. These are some of the most fundamental issues.
    The work of technicians and engineering technical personnel in enterprises plays a direct and decisive role in product quality. At present, the technical strength of heavy industrial enterprises in our country is weak and the technical level is not high. According to statistics from 62 factories in Shenyang, among more than 70,000 technicians, senior technicians of level four and above account for only 30%, and among more than 15,700 engineering technicians, senior engineering technicians above the level of technician account for only more than 500 people. In order to improve their technical level, it is necessary to strengthen regular spare-time technical and cultural education in enterprises, actively organize technical research associations, run short-term training courses, sign apprenticeship contracts, and, in particular, systematically study and promote advanced experience. In short, all measures must be taken to enable more workers and technicians to master the most advanced technology as soon as possible, so as to continuously improve product quality.
    Improving technical level also means establishing a technical work order that is compatible with the new technology. At present, many enterprises do not have complete product quality standards, or if they do, they do not strictly inspect product quality according to this standard. Some do not have complete technical operating procedures that can guarantee that quality requirements are met, or if they do, they are not strictly followed. Some do not pay attention to keeping the working environment clean, and production is very uncivilized. The poor quality of many products is often inseparable from these reasons. For example, some steel plants release steel before the analysis results are available. Some of the main components of machine tools are assembled by hammering. In order to ensure and improve the quality of heavy industrial products, it is necessary to overcome this backward operating habit and the phenomenon of lax technical discipline.
    With the exception of the enterprises newly built and rebuilt in recent years, the technical equipment of the original heavy industrial enterprises in our country is mostly outdated. It is possible to manufacture some products with relatively high quality requirements using this old equipment, and the state encourages enterprises to do so. However, many products with higher quality requirements must have new precision machines and testing equipment to ensure quality. Economic organs at all levels should meet the legitimate needs of enterprises in this regard.
    Some major key issues in improving product quality are often not resolved by the current technical strength and technical level in enterprises. Therefore, various heavy industrial departments should quickly establish and improve their own scientific research institutions, help their main enterprises establish scientific research work as soon as possible, strengthen leadership in scientific research work, and learn from the world's latest scientific and technological achievements, so as to fundamentally accelerate the speed of improving our country's technical level.
    Ensuring and improving the quality of heavy industrial products, the fundamental issue is improving technology. However, this does not mean that ideological problems do not exist. There are still quite a few people who do not pay attention to product quality. Some sacrifice quality to pursue output, they often rush to work, produce crudely, and ask superiors to lower quality standards. Some enterprises take a passive and conservative attitude towards improving product quality, emphasize difficulties, do not actively learn advanced experience and new technologies, and are content with a situation of long-term poor quality. More seriously, some enterprises rely on the fact that "there is only one such company in the country, and you have to accept it even if the product quality is low," and therefore engage in fraud and push out products that they know are of poor quality.
    In order to ensure and improve product quality, Party organizations should strengthen supervision of product quality. Enterprise leaders and the broad masses of workers should fight against all phenomena that ignore product quality. The state's planning organs and various heavy industrial departments should issue quality indicators and strengthen inspections. Those who have made significant achievements in improving product quality should be rewarded and their experience should be quickly promoted. Those who ignore product quality should be criticized and condemned.
    At present, a production upsurge of completing the first five-year plan ahead of schedule is forming in the heavy industry sector. Leaders of various departments and enterprises should give full play to the enthusiasm of workers and engineering technical personnel, and guide their initiative and creativity to learning and mastering new technologies, ensuring and improving product quality.

### 提高重工业产品的质量

    提高重工业产品的质量
    几年来，我国重工业产品的质量，一般是有所改进和提高的，有一些产品的质量已经达到或者接近国际上的先进水平，在一定程度上满足了国家建设的需要。但是，产品质量不好，仍然是各个重工业部门比较普遍和比较严重的问题。重工业部所属钢铁企业，去年生产了三万吨废钢锭，二万吨废钢材；有一部分出厂的钢轨、钢板中含有杂质。沈阳地区的国营机械工厂，去年一年因为铸件不合格，报废了一万吨生铁，二百吨有色金属；有些机械工厂出产的产品性能不好、效率不高、寿命不长。今年以来，质量不好的状况并没有显著好转，有些反而倒退了。京西矿务局安家滩矿和城子矿的原煤含矸率都比过去高了。迅速扭转这种状况，保证和提高产品质量，是各个重工业部门当前的迫切任务。
    提高重工业产品的质量是在我国实现社会主义工业化的一个根本问题。增加重工业的产量，加大重工业的产值在国民经济中所占的比重，这只是实现社会主义工业化的一方面的任务。更重要的是，要使我国成为一个高度工业化的国家，就必须能够独立制造自己所需要的一切产品。而这些我们要逐步学会制造的产品，绝大部分都是我们过去没有制造过的，质量要求非常严格；就是那些过去制造过的，质量要求也大大提高了。为了制造这些产品，就必须要有质量好的原料，有精密的制造机械；生产出的产品也要合乎质量标准。如果我们不能达到这些要求，就不能保证工业发展的速度，就不能保证真正的技术上的独立。
    重工业产品的质量问题现在所以显得特别突出，并不是几年来重工业部门的工作比以前落后了，或者思想上更不重视质量了。几年来我们已开始独立制造大批的苏联和人民民主国家型号和规格的新式机器，钢铁和化学工业等产品也广泛地采用了苏联的国家标准。但是这些新种类的产品代表着世界上最先进的技术科学水平，技术要求很高；而我国原有的工业企业基础落后，无论在机器设备、生产组织和工人的技术操作水平等方面都是不适应的。这就使得产品质量不高的现象，越来越突出。因此，为了提高重工业产品的质量，必须有步骤地全面地对旧有企业进行技术改造，加强技术管理，这是一些最根本的问题。
    企业中技术工人和工程技术人员的工作，对产品质量起着直接的决定作用。目前，我国重工业企业的技术力量薄弱，技术水平不高。据沈阳市六十二个工厂的统计，七万多技术工人中，四级以上的高级技术工人只占30％，一万五千七百多工程技术人员中，技师以上的高级工程技术人员只有五百多人。为了提高他们的技术水平，要加强企业中正规的业余技术文化教育，要积极组织技术研究会，办短期训练班，签订师徒合同，特别是要系统地学习和推广先进经验。总之，必须采取一切办法，使更多的工人和技术人员尽快地掌握最先进的技术，以便不断地提高产品质量。
    提高技术水平，也意味着建立和新的技术相适应的技术工作的秩序。现在不少企业还没有完善的产品质量标准，或者有了也没有严格按照这个标准来检验产品的质量；有的还没有完善的能够保证达到质量要求的技术操作规程，或者有了也没有严格遵守；有的很不注意保持工作环境的清洁，生产很不文明。许多产品质量所以不好，往往是和这些原因分不开的。例如有的钢铁厂不等做出分析结果就出钢；有些机床的主要部件是用锤锤打打的方法装配起来的。为了保证和提高重工业产品的质量，必须克服这种落后的操作习惯和技术纪律松懈的现象。
    除了近几年新建和改建的企业以外，我国原有重工业企业的技术装备大都是陈旧的。利用这些旧的装备，可以制造一些质量要求比较高的产品，国家也鼓励企业这样做。但是，许多质量要求更高的产品，必须有新的精密的机器和检验设备才能保证质量。各级经济机关应当满足企业在这方面的正当需要。
    提高产品质量的一些重大的关键问题，常常是企业里目前的技术力量和技术水平所不能解决的。因此，各个重工业部门应该迅速地建立和健全自己的科学研究机构，尽快地帮助所属的主要企业建立科学研究工作，加强对科学研究工作的领导，学习世界上最新的科学技术成就，以便从根本上来加快提高我国技术水平的速度。
    保证和提高重工业产品的质量，根本的问题是提高技术。但是，这并不是说思想问题就不存在了。现在还有相当多的人不重视产品质量。有的不惜牺牲质量来追求产量，他们常常突击赶工，粗制滥造，要求上级降低质量标准。有的企业对提高产品质量采取消极保守态度，强调困难，不积极学习先进经验和新技术，长期安于质量低劣的状况。更严重的是，还有的企业自恃“全国只此一家，产品质量低点你也得要”，因而弄虚作假，明知产品质量不好，也推出门了事。
    为了保证和提高产品质量，党组织应该加强对产品质量的监督。企业领导者和广大职工应该向一切忽视产品质量的现象作斗争。国家的计划机关和各个重工业部门应该颁布质量指标，加强检查。对提高产品质量有显著成绩的，要给以奖励，并迅速推广他们的经验；对忽视产品质量的人应给以批评和指责。
    目前在重工业部门中，正在形成一个提前全面完成第一个五年计划的生产热潮。各部门和各企业的领导者应该充分发挥工人和工程技术人员的这种热情，把他们的积极性和创造性引导到学习和掌握新技术，保证和提高产品质量上来。
