Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 24th. Comrade Nie Rongzhen, Head of the Delegation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a congratulatory speech at the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea on April 24th. The full text is as follows:

    Dear Comrades:

    Entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people, extend warm and fraternal congratulations to the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea.

    Since the Second Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, have established the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, laying the foundation for striving for the independence of the motherland and the peaceful reunification of Korea. Starting in 1950, for three years, the Korean people heroically resisted the aggression of US imperialism in order to defend the independence of their motherland and safeguard peace in Asia and the world, and achieved significant victories. After the Korean armistice, the Korean people, with a spirit of selfless labor, quickly healed the serious wounds of war and made new achievements in restoring and developing the national economy.

    Now, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is about to complete the three-year plan for restoring and developing the post-war people's economy ahead of schedule. In the second year of the three-year plan, namely at the end of 1955, the total industrial output value of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had exceeded the pre-war 1949 level by 56%, and the entire industrial sector is about to complete all the planned targets of the three-year plan in June and July of this year; in agriculture, 65.6% of the farmers who account for the total number of peasant households in northern Korea have already participated in agricultural production cooperatives, and agricultural output is also constantly increasing. With the rapid recovery and development of industry and agriculture, people's lives have also been improved accordingly. All of this demonstrates the heroic, tenacious, arduous, and selfless labor spirit of the Korean people; at the same time, all of this also proves that the people who have mastered the destiny of their own country possess invincible great power.

    Dear Comrades! The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, who have a long-standing friendship with the Korean people, regard these achievements of the Korean people as their own and are very happy.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are striving to build our country into a socialist society. Our country is rapidly carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce. Now, the vast majority of regions in the country have basically completed agricultural cooperation; the important industries of capitalist industry and commerce in cities across the country have also basically realized the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry; and the cooperation of handicrafts is also moving forward by leaps and bounds. In order to enable our country's scientific level to catch up with the world's advanced level as soon as possible, our country has also made comprehensive plans for the work of intellectuals. Our country's first five-year plan for developing the national economy will be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

    The efforts of the Chinese and Korean peoples to strengthen the construction of their own countries not only help to continuously strengthen the strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, but also help to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

    Since the end of the Korean War, the Workers' Party of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have consistently striven to consolidate the Korean armistice and strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea, but the enemies of peace have tried in every possible way to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and to divide Korea for a long time. Therefore, ensuring the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and achieving the reunification of Korea through peaceful consultation is not only in line with the wishes and interests of the Korean people, but also concerns peace and security in Asia. The Chinese people will resolutely join the peace, democracy, and socialist camp countries and the people of all countries in the world to give full support to the Korean people's struggle to consolidate the armistice and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, just as in the past.

    The convening of the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea will certainly play a tremendous role in peacefully reunifying Korea and further building the national economy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the tasks put forward by the congress will definitely be realized.

    I wish the Workers' Party of Korea greater achievements in leading the Korean people to strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and the development of the national economy!

    Long live the advanced and organized force of the Korean working people—the Workers' Party of Korea!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!

    Long live the unity of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    在朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会上
    聂荣臻同志的祝词
    新华社平壤24日电  中国共产党中央委员会代表团团长、中国共产党中央委员会委员聂荣臻同志在朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会四月二十四日的会议上致祝词，全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我受中国共产党中央委员会的委托，谨代表中国共产党的全体党员和全体中国人民，向朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    自从朝鲜劳动党第二次代表大会以来，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党领导下建立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，奠定了争取祖国独立与和平统一朝鲜的基础。从1950年起，历时三年，朝鲜人民为了保卫自己祖国的独立和维护亚洲和世界的和平，英勇地抵抗了美帝国主义的侵略，并且取得了重大的胜利。在朝鲜停战以后，朝鲜人民又以奋不顾身的劳动精神，迅速地医治了战争的沉重创伤，在恢复和发展国民经济方面取得了新的成就。
    现在，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国即将提前完成恢复和发展战后人民经济的三年计划。在三年计划的第二年即1955年年底，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工业总产值已超过战前1949年水平的56％，并且整个工业部门即将在今年六、七月间全部完成三年计划的预定指标；在农业方面，占朝鲜北部总农户的65.6％的农民已经参加了农业生产合作社，农业产量也不断增加。随着工农业的迅速恢复和发展，人民生活也得到了相应的改善。所有这一切表明了朝鲜人民的英勇顽强、坚苦卓绝和忘我劳动的精神；同时，这一切也证明了掌握了自己国家命运的人民是具有不可战胜的伟大力量的。
    亲爱的同志们！同朝鲜人民有悠久友谊的中国共产党和中国人民把朝鲜人民的这些成就看成同自己的成就一样，感到非常高兴。
    中国人民在中国共产党领导下，正在为我国建成社会主义社会而奋斗。我国正在迅速地进行着对农业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，现在全国绝大多数地区已经基本上完成了农业合作化；全国城市的资本主义工商业的重要行业也基本上实现了全行业的公私合营；手工业的合作化也正在大踏步地向前迈进。为了使我国的科学水平尽快地赶上世界的先进水平，我国对知识分子的工作，也作了全面规划。我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划将提前和超额完成。
    中朝两国人民努力加强自己国家的建设，不仅有助于以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营力量的不断壮大，并且也有助于维护亚洲和世界的和平事业。
    自从朝鲜战争结束以来，朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一贯地为着巩固朝鲜停战和争取朝鲜的和平统一而努力，但是和平的敌人却多方图谋破坏朝鲜停战协定和长期分裂朝鲜。因此保证朝鲜停战协定的执行，通过和平协商方式来实现朝鲜的统一，这不但符合于朝鲜人民的愿望和利益，而且也关系着亚洲的和平和安全。中国人民将坚决地同和平、民主、社会主义阵营国家和世界各国人民一道，如同过去一样，对于朝鲜人民为巩固停战和争取祖国和平统一的斗争给予全力的支持。
    朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会的召开，对于和平统一朝鲜和进一步建设朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国民经济一定会起莫大的作用。我们坚决相信，在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会领导之下，代表大会所提出的任务是一定能够实现的。
    祝朝鲜劳动党在领导朝鲜人民争取祖国的和平统一和发展国民经济的斗争中取得更大的成就！
    朝鲜劳动人民的先进的有组织的部队——朝鲜劳动党万岁！
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营团结万岁！
