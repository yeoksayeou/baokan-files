Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—Reports from various sources: The reactionary U.S. Republican Party's convention was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from June 21st to 25th. The convention, as usual, adopted a platform formulated for the election and nominated the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates for this year's election. On the 23rd, the convention adopted a reactionary platform that "reflects the views of Wall Street" (TASS), advocating an aggressive foreign policy, "regional defense" between the United States and other countries (including the Western European bloc under U.S. direction and control), and continued "foreign aid programs," etc.; domestically, in addition to many empty promises made to win votes, it stubbornly declared the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law a "wise reform" and indicated that it would further deprive workers of their rights. On the evening of the 24th, after three rounds of voting, the meeting elected New York Governor Dewey, who has a background in the Eastern financial tycoons and is closely related to the reactionary Hoover, as the party's presidential candidate for this year's election. On the 25th, the meeting adjourned after "electing" California Governor Warren, who is also related to Hoover, as the party's vice-presidential candidate.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—According to a TASS report from Philadelphia: Dewey, the protégé of Wall Street agent Dulles, was unanimously nominated as the Republican presidential candidate in the third round of voting after fierce competition with Taft, Stassen, and other candidates at the Republican convention. Dewey's opponents prevented Dewey from getting enough votes in the first two rounds, but when the convention resumed on the afternoon of the 24th, Taft, Warren, and Stassen all announced their withdrawal from the race. The American press, including Republican newspapers, admitted that Dewey's nomination as the presidential candidate came after multiple behind-the-scenes secret meetings. After the secret meetings, the major campaign delegations at the convention agreed to withdraw their own nominations in order to exchange them for high-ranking government positions once Dewey was victorious. U.S. journalist Lawrence wrote: The issue had already been decided after big business favored Dewey. The basic political views of the main competitors for the presidential nomination were the same. Their struggle was merely a personal struggle for power and profit, with no political significance. The Howard newspaper group mentioned widespread rumors that Pennsylvania Senator Martin, who followed the instructions of the Pennsylvania party boss to withdraw his candidacy and transfer it to Dewey, may be appointed Minister of Defense in the future. According to newspaper reports, in addition to Dulles, Dewey also had the support of other important figures on Wall Street. The Alsop brothers wrote in the New York Herald Tribune: Talbott, director of the Chrysler Motor Company, who funded Dewey in 1944, oil tycoon Rockefeller, Anaconda Copper Trust, Oklahoma oil magnate Hanz, and others have generously donated to Dewey's campaign this time.

Wallace, the presidential candidate of the American Third Party, commenting on the Republican convention on the 25th, scorned the party's nomination of Dewey. Wallace pointed out that the Republican's campaign in Philadelphia was like many horses coming out of a stable to race. He also said: The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are both parties that advocate a "cold war." And Dewey's foreign policy advisor Dulles is one of the current "planners of the Cold War policy." Wallace believes that the Republican's nomination of Dewey will help the Third Party.

　　共和党一群战贩多次密议后
    提名杜威候选总统
    【新华社陕北一日电】各方报导：反动的美国共和党的代表大会，于六月二十一日至二十五日在宾州的费城举行。该大会照例通过为了竞选而制定的政纲，并提出该党在今年大选中的总统和副总统的候选人。大会于二十三日通过了“反映华尔街观点”（塔斯社）的反动政纲，即对外主张侵略外交，主张美国与他国实行“区域联防”（包括在美国指使与控制下的西欧集团），继续“援外计划”等；对内则除去为了争取选票而作的许多空泛的诺言外，竟顽固地声言塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法为“贤明的改革”，并表示将进一步剥夺工人的权利。二十四日晚，会议在三次投票之后，选出以美国东部金融财阀为背景、并与反动分子胡佛有密切关系的纽约州州长杜威为该党今年大选中的总统候选人。二十五日，会议在“选”出同样与胡佛有关系的加州州长华伦为该党副总统候选人后已闭幕。
    美第三党总统候选人华莱士二十五日在评论共和党大会时，藐视该党之提名杜威。华氏指出，共和党人在费城的竞选，就象许多马从一个马厩中出来赛跑一样。他又说：共和党与民主党同是主张“冷战”的党。而杜威的外交顾问杜勒斯就是目前“冷战政策的策划人之一”。华氏相信，共和党之提名杜威，将帮助第三党。
    【新华社陕北一日电】据塔斯社自费城报导：华尔街代办杜勒斯的干儿子杜威，在共和党大会上与塔夫脱、史塔生等竞选人剧烈交锋之后，已于第三次投票中被一致通过提名为共和党总统的候选人。杜威的对手在头两次投票中，阻止了杜威得到足够的票数，但在二十四日下午大会复会时，塔夫脱、华伦和史塔生都宣布他们退出竞选。包括共和党报纸在内的美国报界承认：杜威之被通过提名为总统候选人，是在多次幕后密议之后。大会各主要竞选代表团在密议之后，同意撤消他们自己的提名，以便在杜威一旦胜利之时，换取政府中的高官厚爵。美记者劳伦斯写道：在大企业家们属意杜威之后，问题就已经决定了。总统候选人的主要竞争者们的基本政见都是相同的。他们的斗争仅仅是个人争权夺利的斗争，没有什么政治意义。霍华德系报纸提到盛传的流言说：听从宾州（宾夕凡尼亚）党老板吩咐而收回候选人资格以转让杜威的宾州参议员马丁，将来可能被任为国防部长。据报纸消息透露，除了杜勒斯之外，杜威还获有华尔街其他重要人物的支持。阿尔索甫兄弟在纽约先驱论坛报上写道：一九四四年曾资助杜威的克利斯勒汽车公司董事泰尔波特、石油大王洛克菲勒、安那康达铜托拉斯、俄克拉荷马石油巨商汉兹等，这次都曾为杜威的竞选慷慨解囊。
