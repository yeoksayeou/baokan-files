　　Sharp Struggle Over Berlin Question, US Imperialist Military Intimidation Bankrupt
    Recently, a sharp struggle has been waged between the world's democratic forces and anti-democratic forces over the German question, primarily the Berlin question. The American reactionaries vainly attempted to intimidate the Soviet Union with military force. At the same time, the American reactionaries and the reactionaries of other countries they support are using a series of despicable terror tactics in an attempt to overwhelm the democratic forces of various countries.
    Since the United States, Britain, and France issued new currencies in West Germany and their occupation zones in Berlin, the struggle over the German question has intensified. In order to prevent the new West German currency from flowing into East Germany and the Soviet occupation zone of Berlin and affecting the economic life of the German people in the Soviet occupation zone, the Soviet Union blocked land traffic between the Soviet occupation zone and West Germany. The US government and its British and French partners sent notes to the Soviet Union demanding the lifting of the blockade and instigated their mouthpieces to intimidate the Soviet Union on a large scale. The Associated Press reported on the 12th that Britain had dispatched a large number of troops to West Germany and would reinforce Berlin. However, the Soviet Union's reply on the 14th was extremely firm and tough, pointing out that the current situation in Berlin was the result of the US, British, and French governments violating the four-power decision, and stating that the Soviet Union did not object to negotiations, but the Berlin issue could not be separated from the entire German issue. The Soviet Union's reply gave the unreasonable demands of the United States, Britain, and France a head-on blow. In the face of the Soviet Union's firm attitude, the American reactionaries became anxious and played a series of "war of nerves" tricks. On the 16th, the US government officially announced the dispatch of sixty Superfortress bombers (which they called "atomic bombers") to Britain; on the 17th, former Director of the US Strategic Services (the US foreign espionage agency) Donovan said: he "suggested imposing economic sanctions on the Soviet Union and blocking the Panama, Suez, and Kiel Canals, and the Dardanelles Strait"; on the 18th, United Press reported that the US was initiating "a plan to send armored trains or armored vehicles to transport food supplies to besieged Berlin"; on the 19th, US Interior Secretary Krug said that Western countries "will eventually have a war with the Soviet Union." However, none of these measures intimidated the Soviet Union. On the contrary, the Soviet Union strengthened its ground and air inspection and protection measures and allocated 100,000 tons of wheat and an equal amount of other food on the 20th to supply the entire Berlin "in its own way," winning the heartfelt gratitude of the German people. Moreover, the war atmosphere created by the American reactionaries was too tense, which instead alarmed its partners. Originally, Britain was not very active in this incident. The Associated Press report on Britain's troop increase in Berlin was dismissed by three British officials as "nonsense" on the same day. According to a United Press report from The Hague on the 20th, when the "Western European Union" Foreign Ministers' Conference was held in The Hague, "on the Berlin issue, British Foreign Secretary Bevin opposed a showdown with the Soviet Union. French Foreign Minister Bidault and the Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg especially opposed any grandiose plan to break the Berlin blockade by force, and they urged the restoration of four-power negotiations by all possible means." Under these circumstances, Marshall declared on the 21st that "the United States will use diplomatic and negotiation methods to achieve a possibly acceptable solution to the Berlin situation," revealing the true colors of a "paper tiger."

### 柏林问题尖锐斗争美帝武力恫吓破产

　　柏林问题尖锐斗争美帝武力恫吓破产
    最近时期中，世界民主力量与反民主力量在德国问题首先在柏林问题上进行了尖锐的斗争。美国反动派妄图以武力恫吓苏联。与此同时，美国反动派及其所支持的其他国家的反动派，正在使用一连串的卑鄙的恐怖手段，企图压倒各国的民主力量。
    自美、英、法在西德及其在柏林占领区发行新货币以来，德国问题的斗争就尖锐了起来。苏联为防止西德新货币流入东德及柏林苏占区，影响苏占区德国人民的经济生活，乃封锁苏占区与西德间的陆上交通。美国政府及其英、法伙伴照会苏联，要求撤消上述封锁，同时策动其喉舌，苏联大肆恫吓。美联社十二日传出英国已派大量军队至西德并将增兵柏林的消息。然而，苏联于十四日复文的立场是极其坚定而强硬，指出柏林现势是美英法政府违反四国决定的结果，又表明苏联并不反对谈判，但不能把柏林问题与整个德国问题分开来谈。苏联的复文予美、英、法的无理要求以当头一喝。在苏联坚定态度的前面，美国反动派着了急，于是就玩了一连串的“神经战”把戏。十六日，美国官方宣布派遣六十架超级空中堡垒（他们把它叫做“原子弹轰炸机”）赴英；十七日，美前战略服务局（美国在外间谍机关）局长杜诺万扬言：他“建议对苏施行经济制裁，并封锁巴拿马、苏彝士、基尔三运河和达达尼尔海峡”；十八日，合众社称，美方发起“派遣装甲火车或装甲汽车运送粮食供应品至被包围之柏林的计划”；十九日，美内长克鲁格说西方国家“终将发生与苏联的战争”。但是，所有这些措施，并没有吓倒苏联，相反，苏联倒是加强了它在地面及空中的检查与保护措施，并于二十日拨发十万吨小麦和同等数量的其他食粮，“按照自己的方法”供应整个柏林，博得了德国人民的衷心感激。而且，美国反动派所制造的战争空气太紧张了，倒反而使得它的伙伴们惶恐起来。本来，在这次事件中，英国就不大积极。美联社关于英国增兵柏林的消息当天就为三位英国官员斥为“无稽”。据合众社海牙二十日电称，当海牙举行“西欧联盟”五国外长会议时，“在柏林问题上，英外相贝文反对与苏联摊牌，法外长比道尔及荷比卢外长，特别反对以武力打通柏林封锁的任何堂皇计划，他们并教促以一切可能的方法恢复四强谈判。”在这种情况下，马歇尔于二十一日宣称“美国将运用外交与谈判的方法使柏林局势获得可能接受之解决”，这就现出了“纸老虎”的原形。
