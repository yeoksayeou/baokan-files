　　Reasonable Work Point System and Democratic Leadership
    Mutual Aid Teams in Western Anshang Consolidate
    [Taihang News] The mutual aid team in Western Anshang Village, Sixth District of Pingshun, has improved the production enthusiasm of the masses, with everyone benefiting and the organization becoming increasingly consolidated, by implementing democratic leadership, reasonable work point system, and integrating agriculture, sideline production, and war support. The team includes twenty-eight households, one hundred and sixty-five mu of land, sixteen full laborers, five half laborers, and five auxiliary laborers, and was organized last May in response to the call of higher authorities. At that time, the whole village formed nine teams. During the winter and spring rectification of the mutual aid groups, it was proposed that participation should be democratic and voluntary, and eight teams were automatically disbanded. After several rectifications, they have not yet been successfully re-established; only the Western Anshang team has been consistently consolidated. Team members said: "Our combination is definitely inseparable." The team's work point calculation method is relatively reasonable: for agricultural labor, each laborer's standard work point is ten points. Laborers are of varying strengths, so a fixed point system with flexible adjustments is implemented (work points are set based on the specific task). The current wage is four jin of rice per ten points (regardless of meals). Livestock ploughing and harrowing two and a half mu of land or more per day is worth twenty points, or the household using the livestock provides fifteen jin of grass and five jin of feed. For sideline production operated with one's own funds, the team takes 5% of the earned profit, and this 5% is then divided among all team members (including the individual). The team will cultivate their land and earn their wages. If team funds are used for production, the team takes 15% of the profit (distribution method is the same as above). If team funds are used for commercial production, the profits are divided on a public-two-private-eight basis. Those going out to participate in the war and eating public meals are assigned five points per day, plus a bonus of two points, totaling seven points. Those on errands carrying sixty jin back and forth sixty li earn ten points, and a bonus of one point for each night spent away (distant errand) (because of large expenses), and more points for carrying more. When the team was first formed, it only had 17,000 yuan (Jicha, same below) of funds, bought four trees, sawed them into boards and sold them for a profit of four shi of rice. During the wheat planting season, the autumn seedlings were very bad, and it looked like there would be a disaster. Eight laborers and five livestock were dispatched to Lucheng and other areas to do short-term work ploughing wheat fields, earning more than seven shi of millet in more than twenty days. With such active production, by the end of April this year, a total of 650,000 yuan and 92 shi and 7 dou of rice had been earned. On average, each laborer earned 25,000 yuan and 1 shi and 1 dou and 4 sheng of rice. Sang Yucai's family of seven only harvested more than three shi of coarse grains last year, and had nothing to eat by winter. He earned 250 jin of rice doing earthwork outside, and more than 70 jin doing short-term work. The team took care of his family, and he only contributed 50 jin (no more work in winter), so he still has food to eat. His wife earned more than 300 work points in labor-capital cooperation, and the rice she earned from these 300 points has not been used yet. He said: "I have benefited greatly from the triple combination! Otherwise, I would not be able to survive now!" Zhang Jiahe did not do his job well in the team, and only picked on others' faults, and did not change after several criticisms. In order to educate him, everyone temporarily expelled him from the team to let him try it out. As a result, he could not take care of the family and could not take care of the outside, and it was very difficult. He said to people: "I am determined to change!" Finally, he admitted his mistakes to everyone and was absorbed back in. Because the work point system is reasonable, some weak laborers that other teams are unwilling to accept are welcomed into this team. One person in Eastern Anshang only earned seven points (poor labor), and no extra points were added for doing more work; later, when he came to this team, he earned eight points and nine points for doing more work, and he became more and more energetic. One of the main reasons why this team can be managed relatively rationally and perfectly is that the leadership method is democratic, and can absorb and concentrate everyone's opinions at any time, come up with solutions to problems, and improve work. For example, pulling wood planks in the first month of this year was calculated by the day, one day counted as one work day, and some people were loafing on the job (being lazy); the leadership then organized everyone to discuss and found out the problems, and changed it to setting work points according to the task, and as a result, everyone worked more vigorously. Before, one person could pull at most one zhang and two chi a day, and later they pulled one zhang and six chi. For sideline production using one's own funds, the team used to take 10% of the profit, and no one was willing to go out; later, after everyone's research, it was changed to 5%, and everyone scrambled to go out and earn a lot of money.

### 订分合理领导民主　西岸上互助队巩固

　　订分合理领导民主
    西岸上互助队巩固
    【太行讯】平顺六区库＠村西岸上的互助队，实行民主领导，合理订分，农业、副业与战勤结合，提高了群众的生产积极性，人人得利，组织日趋巩固。该队包括二十八户，一百六十五亩地，十六个全劳力，五个半劳力，五个辅助劳力，是去年五月响应上级号召组织起来的。当时全村共组成九个队。去冬今春整顿互助组提出民主自愿，八个队都自动解散了，经过几次整顿，还没有搞起来；只有西岸上这个队，一直很巩固。队员说：“咱这结合非结合到底不可。”该组的计工办法比较合理：农业劳动，每个劳力标准分为十分，劳力有强有弱，实行死分活折（按活订分），现在的工资是每十分四斤米（不管饭），牲口每天犁耙地二亩半以上为二十分，或由用牲口户出草十五斤，料五斤。副业生产用自己资金经营的，队里抽他所赚红利的百分之五，这百分之五再由全队伙分（他本人在内），队里给他种地，赚他的工资。如用队里资金去生产，队里抽红利百分之十五（分配办法同上）。搞商业生产用队里资金的，按公二私八批红。外出参战吃公家饭的，每天订五分，另奖二分，共七分。支差每负六十斤往返六十里顶十分，在外住一宿（远差）奖一分（因开支大），多担了多顶分。该队初组成时，只有一万七千元（冀钞，下同）资金，买了四棵树，拉成板卖了赚了四石米。到种麦时期，秋苗很坏，眼看要闹灾荒，便抽了八个劳力、五个牲口到潞城一带打短工犁麦地，二十多天赚回小米七石多。这样积极生产，到今年四月底，共赚洋六十五万元，米九十二石七斗。平均每个劳力赚洋二万五千元，米一石一斗四。桑玉才家七口人，去年只打了三石多粗粮，冬天就没了吃的。他到外边做土工赚米二百五十斤，打短工赚七十多斤，队里照顾他家，他只出了五十斤（冬天没多的活），所以他到现在还有吃的，他女人在劳资合作里赚下三百多分，这三百多分该赚的米还没动用。他说：“我是沾了三结合的大光啦。要不，我这时就不能过呀！”张加和在队里不好好做活，光挑别人的毛病，批评几次也不改。大家为了教育他，便把他暂时开除出队，叫他试试。结果他顾了家里顾不了外边，非常困难。对人说：“我决心转变！”最后向大家承认错误，又被吸收进来。由于订分合理，有些别的队不肯吸收的软弱劳力，这队都大开门往进收。有一个人在东岸上只顶七分（劳力差），多做了活也不加分；后来到了这队，多做了活就加到八分、九分，他越干越有劲。该队所以能搞得比较合理完善，主要原因之一是领导方法民主，能随时吸收与集中大家意见，想出办法解决问题，改进工作。比如今年正月拉木板是按天计工，一天算一工，有些人磨洋工（偷懒）；领导上便组织大家讨论，找出了毛病所在，改成按活订分，结果都干得有了劲。以前一人一天顶多拉一丈二，以后拉到了一丈六。用自己资金搞副业，以前队里抽红利百分之十，谁也不愿出去；后来经大家研究改抽百分之五，大家便抢着出去，赚回很多钱。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（牛焕章、杨海忠）
