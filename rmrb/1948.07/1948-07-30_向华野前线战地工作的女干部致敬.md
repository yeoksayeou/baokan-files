　　Saluting the Female Cadres Working on the Front Lines of the East China Field Army
　　Deng Yingchao
　　Recently, I met Li Landing, a young female comrade who is serving as a medical team leader among you, and heard about your various situations on the front lines, especially the many admirable and heroic deeds in medical rescue work. These deeds deeply moved and encouraged us!
　　You account for 30% of all medical personnel on the front lines of the East China Field Army, and 80% to 90% in the rear. Among you, some hold positions such as Deputy Minister of the Army Health Department, Hospital President, Medical Team Leader, Director of Medical Affairs, Section Chief, Instructor, Medical Officer, Company Medical Officer, and Head of the Transfer Station. You often work in the wilderness, mountains, and along the Yellow River, about thirty to fifty miles away from the war front. Amidst the rumbling of artillery fire and the bombing of Chiang Kai-shek's and the U.S.'s planes, you accept one arduous task of receiving the wounded after another without fear or fatigue. During the famous Battle of Menglianggu, some of you worked tirelessly, day and night, without hunger or sleep, continuously and methodically for four days and four nights, resulting in more than six hundred heroes, including yourselves. What heroic and touching deeds!
　　You often move with the troops, maintaining a marching speed of fifteen miles per hour with the soldiers, learning to climb walls and houses, overcome obstacles, and cross ditches. Sometimes you continue marching urgently for one to two hundred miles to reach the designated place to accept the task, and then immediately begin your work. As a result of your joint efforts with other medical personnel, 60% to 70% of the commanders and fighters of the East China Field Army, who were gloriously wounded in the People's Liberation War over the past two years, have recovered and returned to the front lines. What a great achievement and contribution!
　　Among you emerged the female hero Jiang Nanping. She participated in six battles in more than a year. Once, she volunteered to carry a stretcher for fifty to sixty miles. After being awake for two days and nights, she was ordered to set off again, marching for another night. At dawn, the battle began, and she immediately started emergency rescue work. At this moment, a bullet fired by enemy planes swept down from the sky and hit her right arm. She was wounded. As soon as she was bandaged, she heard that two wounded soldiers' residences had caught fire due to enemy strikes. Disregarding her pain, she selflessly and fearlessly rushed into the raging fire and rescued two wounded soldiers. Among you, there were Ding Huiqing and Li Landing, who broke their ribs while climbing mountains and wading through rivers to urgently rescue and transport the wounded; Yao Jian, who was poisoned and thrown into a lake by local bandits and secret agents in the middle of the night while inquiring about the wounded; and many other model workers and brave soldiers who were wounded, disabled, or sacrificed. You who are alive, the scars on your bodies will forever be your glorious medals. The heroic names of those female martyrs who sacrificed themselves will forever live in the hearts of the people. You are the outstanding daughters of the Chinese people, you are good cadres of the Party and the People's Liberation Army, and you are the glory of Chinese women!
　　Among you are female workers from factories in big cities, housewives from rural areas, and more often female student intellectuals. Except for a very few, most of you have not studied medicine. Under the education of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and under the education of the military, political, medical and health leadership organs of the East China Field Army, you have worked hard to learn medical skills and techniques in a short period of time, overcome various difficulties, and shoulder important tasks. You are loved by the wounded and respected by the entire army and the people. I believe that you will not become arrogant or complacent because of all this. I hope that you will continue to persevere tenaciously, develop your strengths, overcome some of the shortcomings that still exist in your diagnosis and care, strengthen your spirit of high affection for the wounded, and improve the efficiency of your technical and medical work, so as to strive to cure more wounded soldiers and send them back to the front lines.
　　Your heroic work, hard struggle, self-sacrifice, and spirit of wholeheartedly serving the wounded, serving the war, and serving the people are worthy of learning by all female comrades in the Party. Female comrades in all regions and on all fronts should learn from you, spur themselves on, concentrate on their work, do their jobs well, overcome individualistic thoughts, abandon petty calculations in life, and serve the people better!
　　Your work achievements prove that the East China Field Army's leadership organs' policy of cultivating a large number of female cadres and boldly using female cadres is correct and effective. This policy should also be adopted by other leadership organs. In particular, the construction work in the old liberated areas and the departments of various rear institutions that are suitable for female comrades to work in should employ more female cadres boldly, so as to free up more male cadres to go to the front lines and develop work in the new areas. Cultivating and employing female cadres in large numbers to do all possible work, like organizing women to work in rural areas is the central issue of the current women's movement.
　　Female comrades who are fighting on the front lines of the East China Field Army! All female comrades who are fighting in the army, in the organs, in the government administrative departments, in rural work, and in various production organizations! Your work has already constituted an important part of the people's liberation cause, and will constitute an even more important part in the future. You attract my deeply moved and inspired heart, longing for the front, longing for you, I extend my cordial greetings and regards to you from afar with enthusiasm and sincerity! July 10, 1948.

　　向华野前线战地工作的女干部致敬
    邓颖超
    最近我见着了你们当中的一个担任医疗队长的青年女同志——李蓝丁，听到了你们在前线的各种情况，特别是在医疗救护工作方面许多可歌可颂的英勇事迹。这些事迹深深地感动着我们，鼓励着我们！
    你们有着占华野前线全体医务人员百分之三十的人数，在后方则占百分之八十到九十。在你们当中有人担任着部队卫生部副部长、医院院长、医疗队长、医务主任、室长、指导员、医务员、连卫生员和转运总分站长等岗位的工作。你们经常工作在距战争火线约三数十里的原野上、山林间和黄河两岸，在隆隆的炮声中，在蒋美机群的轰炸下，在紧张剧烈战争的环境里，你们毫无惧怕，不知疲劳的接受一个紧接着一个的繁巨的接收伤员的任务。在有名的孟良崮战役中，你们当中有些人，曾经不分日夜，不知饥饿，不知睡眠，无休止地但是有条不紊地工作了整整四天四夜，产生了包括你们在内的六百多名功臣。这是多么英勇感人的事迹！
    你们经常随着部队转移行动，同样能和战士们保持着每小时十五里的行军速度，学会了爬墙翻屋，通过障碍，越过渠沟，有时继续一二百里的急行军赶到指定接受任务的地方，马上就开始了你们的工作。你们和其他的医务人员共同努力的结果，使华东野战军在两年来人民解放战争中光荣负伤的指战员们，有百分之六十到七十伤愈体健，重上前线。这是多么伟大的成绩和贡献！
    在你们当中，出现了女英雄蒋南屏。她在一年多当中，参加了六次战斗。有一次她曾经自告奋勇的抬了五、六十里的担架，在两昼夜都没有睡觉的时候，即奉命出发，继续又是一夜的行军，拂晓时战斗开始，她就进入急救工作。这时从天上飞来的敌机扫射着的一颗子弹，正打到她的右臂上，她负伤了。刚包扎好，听说有两处伤员住地着弹起火，她不顾伤痛，忘我地无畏地直冲进了熊熊的火屋中，抢救出了两名伤员。在你们当中，出现了为急救抢运伤员翻山涉水而折断肋骨的丁慧清、李蓝丁，为探问伤员，深夜半途被土顽特务毒杀后抛入湖中的姚健，以及其他许多的模范工作者，许多因负伤而残废，而牺牲的勇士。你们活着的，你们身上的伤痕，将永远是你们光荣的奖证。那些牺牲了的女烈士，她们的英名将永远活在人们的心中。你们是中国人民的优秀女儿，你们是党和人民解放军的好干部，是中国妇女的光荣！
    你们当中，有来自大城市工厂的女工，亦有出身于农村的家庭妇女，更多的是女学生知识分子，其中除极少数人以外，都是没有学过医的。你们在共产党和解放军的教育下，在华野军政医卫领导机关的教育下，努力学习，在不很长的时间里，就学会了医务和技术，克服各种困难，担负重要任务。你们受着伤员的爱戴，你们受到整个部队和人民的尊敬。我相信，这一切，你们不会因而自骄自满的。我希望你们继续顽强地坚持下去，发扬你们的长处，克服你们在诊断护理方面还存在着的某些粗枝大叶的缺点，加强对伤员高度友爱的精神，提高技术和医疗工作的效率，以便争取治愈更多的伤员重上前线。
    你们的英勇工作、艰苦奋斗、自我牺牲的精神，全心全意为伤员服务，为战争服务，为人民服务的精神，是值得全党女同志学习的。各个地区，各个战线上的女同志们，都应当向你们学习，鞭策自己，安心工作，做好业务，克服个人主义的思想，抛弃生活琐事的计较，更好地为人民服务！
    你们的工作成绩，证明了华东野战军领导机关所采用的大量培养女干部、放手使用女干部的政策，是正确的和有效的。这一政策也应当被其他方面的领导机关所采用。特别是老解放区的建设工作和后方各种机关适合于女同志工作的部门，更大量地放手地任用女干部，以便腾出更多的男干部上前线，到新区去开展工作。大量地培养任用女干部来做一切可能的工作，与在农村中大量地组织妇女劳动，同样是当前妇女运动的中心课题。
    正奋斗在前线战地的华野部队中的女同志们！正奋斗在部队、在机关、在政府行政部门、在农村工作中和各种生产组织中的一切女同志们！你们的工作已经构成人民解放事业的重要部分，以后还将构成更重要的部分。你们吸引着我深受感动激励的心，向往着前线，向往着你们，我以热情和诚意向你们遥致亲切的慰问和敬礼！　　　　　　　　一九四八、七、十。
