Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: The Headquarters of the Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has scheduled the release of Mr. Crakes, a British technician captured on Chiang Kai-shek's icebreaker during the Yingkou Campaign, on July 7th. A spokesperson for the headquarters issued the following statement regarding the incident: On February 28th of this year, the second day after our army liberated Yingkou, an icebreaker suddenly entered the port of Yingkou from Huludao, which was occupied by the Kuomintang. Our army immediately boarded the ship for inspection and ordered the crew to go ashore to investigate its origin for further processing. The democratic government of our liberated area and the People's Liberation Army have consistently adopted a policy of protection for ordinary foreign ships and their ordinary Chinese and foreign personnel under normal circumstances; however, this icebreaker entered our port from the enemy side under direct war conditions, serving the enemy's military actions, and therefore the ship and its personnel had to be detained for inspection. After the crew disembarked, Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft flew in and bombed the ship, but the crew suffered no losses due to the protection of our army. Among the crew members, in addition to 23 Chinese, there was also a technician holding a British passport. All of them were sent to the rear of our army for interrogation. The British man stated his name was Crakes, 26 years old. On December 14th of last year, he went to Tanggu from Shanghai and served as a technician on the Kuomintang's "Beiji (North Pole) No. 1" icebreaker. After our army verified that the British technician was merely an ordinary employee seeking a living with his technical skills, it was decided to release the British man on July 7th and send him to Zhangwu Dian, 20 kilometers northwest of Xinmin County, on the Northwest Ninglu Road in Shenyang, so that he could take a plane to Tianjin and Shanghai to contact the British Consulate. Furthermore, it is reported that the released British technician, Crakes, issued a statement before leaving, stating: "I am a British citizen, and my profession is seafarer, working as an engineer on ships. On November 20th, 1947, I was hired by Tanggu New Port and worked as the 'Chief Technician' on the 'Beiji No. 1' tugboat, guiding the personnel in the engine room to operate the ship. After the 'Beiji No. 1' arrived in Tanggu, it was responsible for icebreaking work. On December 14th of last year, the ship sailed to Huludao, and on February 27th, 1948, it left Huludao for Yingkou, arriving in Yingkou on the morning of the 28th, going up the river (referring to the Hun River), and was captured by the People's Liberation Army in that area. On the 29th, I left the ship and was detained. I passed through many towns from Yingkou and arrived in Harbin on May 13th. The government officials who escorted me and those I came into contact with treated me very well, and the treatment in Harbin was also very good. On the way to Harbin, I heard that the 'Beiji No. 1' was bombed by Kuomintang aircraft. During my stay in the liberated areas, I felt that the situation in the liberated areas was very different from what another person in the Kuomintang area wanted me to believe. The various behaviors and military discipline in the army were very good. Every soldier felt that he had the responsibility to establish a new democratic country for the Chinese people. The education that everyone in the liberated area received on the policies of the democratic government made it easier for them to understand their goals and gave them great confidence in the future. In the liberated areas, the democratic rights and freedoms of the people have been established, prices are very stable, and the living conditions of farmers have greatly improved since the implementation of land reform. All the people in the liberated areas have a sense of security. They automatically support the democratic government. I believe that the victory of the civil war will belong to the People's Liberation Army, and all the Chinese people will be liberated and will be able to enjoy a better life forever. Because I cannot speak Chinese and there is no suitable work to do here, I would be very grateful if the democratic government could find a way to send me back." Crakes. (Signature)

　　东北军区司令部
    释放蒋军破冰船英籍技师
    【新华社东北四日电】中国人民解放军东北军区司令部定于七月七日释放前在营口战役中蒋军破冰船上被俘的英籍技师克莱克一名。司令部发言人发表此事经过称：本年二月二十八日，即我军解放营口后第二日，突有破冰船一只，由国民党占领之葫芦岛方面开入营口港。我军当即登船检查，并命令船员登岸考查其来历以凭处理。我解放区民主政府与人民解放军，在通常情况下，对于通常外来船只及其中的通常中外人员，一贯采取保护政策；但此破冰船则系在直接战争情况下由敌方开入我港，服务于敌人的军事行动，自须将该船及其中人员扣留检查。船员登岸后，蒋军飞机即飞来将该船炸毁，但船员因我军保护未受损失。船员除中国人二十三名外，尚有持英国护照之技师一名，均经送往我军后方讯问，该英人据谈名克莱克，年二十六岁。去年十二月十四日由上海到塘沽，在国民党“北极”一号破冰船上担任技师职务。我军于查明该英籍技师仅系普通以技术谋生的职员后，决定于七月七日将该英人释放，送到沈阳西北宁路上的新民县城西北二十公里的彰武电，以便他可以搭飞机赴天津和上海，与英国领事馆连络。又讯：被释之英籍技师克莱克于行前发表声明称：“我是英国人，职业是海员，在船上当工程师。在一九四七年十一月廿日受雇于塘沽新港，在“北极”一号曳船上当“技师长”，指导机器间的人员开船。“北极”一号到塘沽后，即担任破冰工作。去年十二月十四日该船开赴葫芦岛亦于一九四八年二月二十七日离葫芦岛赴营口，二十八日晨抵营口，沿河（按指浑河）上溯，即于该地为人民解放军俘获。二十九日我即离船并被拘留。我从营口经过许多城镇，于五月十三日到了哈尔滨。途中护送我的和我所接触到的政府官员都对我非常优待，在哈尔滨对我待遇也很好。在赴哈途中，听说“北极”一号被国民党飞机炸毁。在我住在解放区期间，我感到解放区情形与在国民党区域时的另外一种人要使我相信的十分不同，军队中各种行为和军纪都非常好。每个兵士都感到他自己就有为中国人民建立一个新民主主义国家的责任。解放区里每一个人，对民主政府政策所受的教育，使他们更易了解他们奋斗的目标，和使他们对于前途有了极大信心。在解放区里人民的民主权利和自由已经确立，物价很稳定，土地改革实现以来农民生活情形已经大为改善，解放区所有人民都有一种安全的信念。他们自动的拥护民主政府。我认为，内战的胜利必属人民解放军，全中国人民也将被解放，而能永享美好的生活。因为我不能讲中国话，而且此地并无适当的工作可作，民主政府如能设法遣送我回去，我是很感激的。克莱克。（签名）
