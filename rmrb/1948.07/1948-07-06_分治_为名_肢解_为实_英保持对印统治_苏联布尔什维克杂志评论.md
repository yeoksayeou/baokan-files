Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th—TASS reports: The Bolshevik magazine in Moscow recently published an article stating that the dismemberment of India (i.e., the so-called "partition") has not and cannot solve any of the problems facing India. The two dominions of Hindustan and Pakistan are entirely artificial states in terms of their people's economy and national composition. Pakistan, with a population of 70 million, is entirely a backward agricultural region. All the industry within its borders accounts for only 10 percent of the total industry in India, and it does not have a large industrial center. This typical colonial economic characteristic is only to facilitate Britain's transformation of Pakistan into an agricultural appendage. Hindustan's economy is also a typical colonial economy. The banking system constitutes a powerful means of colonial exploitation in India; except for two, India's major banks are controlled by British monopoly capitalists. India's industry is entirely dependent on British bankers. One-third of Hindustan's steel industry, all of its mining and rubber plantations, and most of its jute and tea industries are in the hands of British capitalists. British-Indian joint ventures, in which British capital occupies a leading position, are one of the important tools for British rule in India. Britain's debt to India in pounds sterling also constitutes a special means of financially enslaving India. On the surface, the British government seems to have abandoned direct and open rule over the new "dominions," but British imperialism's political position in India is still so strong that the "autonomy" of the new "dominions" is actually just a formality. Although all the ministers of the Indian Federation and Pakistan, and even the Governor-General of India, are Indians, the main positions in the state organs, police, and army of the two "dominions" are held by the British. Several provincial governors are also British. The vast majority of British officers who served in India are still serving in the Indian army as "volunteers." Sixteen of the nineteen British major generals and two hundred and sixty of the two hundred and eighty brigadier generals remaining in India have "agreed" to serve in the Indian army. The Bolshevik magazine concludes that the dismemberment of India has resulted in British imperialism maintaining political and economic control over India.

　　“分治”为名“肢解”为实
    英保持对印统治
    苏联布尔什维克杂志评论
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：莫斯科布尔什维克杂志顷著论称，印度的肢解（按即所谓“分治”），未曾而且也不能解决印度所面临的任何问题。印度斯坦和巴基斯坦两个自治领，就其人民经济及民族成份而言，都是十足的人为国家。拥有七千万人口的巴基斯坦，全是落后的农业地区，境内所有的工业，仅占印度全境工业的百分之十，它没有一个很大的工业中心。这种典型殖民地经济特点，只是为了便利于英国把巴基斯坦变成农业附属国。印度斯坦的经济也是典型的殖民地经济。银行制度构成了印度殖民地开发的强有力手段；印度的大银行，除两家以外都为英国垄断资本家所掌握。印度的工业完全依靠英国的银行家。印度斯坦钢铁业的三分之一，炼矿业及橡胶园的全部，黄麻业及茶叶的大部分都在英国资本家手中。英国资本占领导地位的英印合股公司，是英国统治印度的重要工具之一。英国欠印度的英镑债务，也构成了在金融上奴役印度的特殊手段。在表面上，英国政府似乎已放弃了对新“自治领”的直接与公开的统治，但英帝国主义在印度的政治地位还是如此强大，以致新“自治领”的“自治”实际上徒具形式。虽然印度联邦及巴基斯坦的一切部长甚至印度总督都是印度人，但两个“自治领”的国家机关、警察及军队中的主要位置，都为英国人所把持。若干省长也还是英国人。曾在印度服役之英国军官的绝大多数，仍在印军中当“志愿兵”。留印的英军少将十九人中的十六人及准将二八零人中的二六零人，已“同意”在印军中服役。布尔什维克杂志结语称，印度肢解的结果，使英帝国主义保持了在政治上及经济上对印度的统治。
