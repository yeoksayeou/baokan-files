Taiyue Telegram: Nanyicheng Village in the Second District of Jincheng, corrected the past deviation of relying solely on mutual aid teams to bear the task of substitute farming, achieving a rational burden for the entire village. The village has 169 households, with 53 military family households. In the past, regardless of whether the military family members had labor power or how much land they owned, they were all required to have substitute farming done by mutual aid teams, and those who did not participate in the mutual aid teams were not responsible. This placed the task of substitute farming on a small number of people, and the masses said, "The light ones are too light, and the heavy ones are too heavy!" Because there were few people doing substitute farming, the land was not well cultivated. The military families were also dissatisfied, saying, "Further preferential treatment will exhaust us." Recently, during the rectification of mutual aid, according to the opinions of the masses, the past method was changed, and fair and reasonable substitute farming methods were stipulated. First, all 137 full and semi-laborers in the village who were capable of production were registered, and substitute farming duties were assigned according to each person's labor situation. At the same time, military families were persuaded and mobilized to produce for self-sufficiency, instead of waiting for preferential treatment. It was stipulated that families with one full laborer would not receive preferential treatment, and families with half a laborer would receive half the preferential treatment. In this way, 28 out of the 53 households were exempted from preferential treatment. The number of households requiring substitute farming was reduced by one-half, but the number of people doing substitute farming increased by two times compared to the past. The specific substitute farming methods stipulated were: (1) For military families who should receive preferential treatment, families with one person will have three mu of land substitute-farmed, two people will have five mu, three people will have six mu, and four people will have seven mu, adopting a progressive reduction method to provide basic guarantees for the lives of lonely, widowed, and powerless military families. (2) Each mu of land is given substitute farming with eight man-days and two and a half animal-days, and preferential treatment tickets are issued to military families. If the labor exceeds this amount, the military families pay wages to the mutual aid teams. If less labor is used due to their own labor, the village compensates with wages to encourage military families to be self-reliant and engage in production. (3) General military families use preferential labor, provide meals but do not pay wages, while poor military families do not provide meals. Animal-power substitute farming provides fodder for the military families' livestock. After this method was implemented, each of the 124 laborers in the village only had to bear five workdays per year; and each of the 49 livestock only had to bear four workdays. The masses all said, "With so few workdays per person, we must do a good job for them even if we don't get meals." The military families were also very satisfied. Li Detu was allocated 42 preferential workdays this time, but her two daughters-in-law exchanged work with others, cultivated the land completely well, and did not use preferential treatment tickets.

　　扩大代耕面组织军属生产
  　南义城合理代耕
    【太岳电】晋城二区南义城村，改正过去单靠互助组负担代耕任务的偏向，做到全村合理负担。全村有一百六十九户，有五十三户军属，过去不管军属有无劳力和土地多少，一律叫互助组代耕，不参加互助组的就不负担。把代耕任务放在少数人身上，群众说：“轻的轻死了，重的重死了！”因为代耕的人少，代耕的地也种不好。军属也不满的说：“再优待就把俺优待干了。”最近整顿互助时，根据群众意见，改变了过去的办法，规定了公平合理的代耕办法。先把全村能生产的一百三十七个全半劳力登记起来，按各人劳力情形分担代耕勤务，同时说服与发动军属生产自给，不要坐等优待。规定家有一个全劳力的就不优待，有半个劳力的优待一半。这样五十三户中有二十八户免去了优待。需代耕的户数减少了二分之一，代耕人数却比过去增加了二倍。具体代耕办法，规定：（一）应优待的军属，家有一口人的给代耕三亩，两口人的代耕五亩，三口者六亩，四口者七亩，采取累进递减办法，使孤寡无力军属，生活上有了基本保证。（二）每亩地按八个人工两个半畜工给以代耕，发给军属优待票。超过的工，军属给互助组出工资，因自己劳动而少用了工，村中补给工资，以鼓励军属自力更生，进行生产。（三）一般军属使用优待工，管饭不出工资，贫苦军属不管饭。畜力代耕军属畜料。这办法实行以后，全村一百二十四个劳力，每人全年只负担五个工；四十九个牲口，每个负担四个工。群众都说：“每人这么几个工，不管饭也要给人家做好”。军属们也很满意，李德土这次分了四十二个优待工，但她两个媳妇和别人换工，把地完全种好，没有用优待票。
