Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to various sources, the price surge in the Chiang-controlled areas, after reaching its peak on June 26th, only paused for a week before a new wave began. The short-term, slight price decline at the end of June and the beginning of July was due to the banks' mid-year closing of accounts and tight monetary conditions. According to Associated Press and United Press reports, on the 3rd of this month, the price of rice in Shanghai set a new record of 26 million (Chiang currency - hereinafter the same), an increase of 2 million compared to the highest price of the previous wave, and 2.6 million times the price of rice before the War of Resistance. The black market exchange rate for US dollars has also rebounded, with sellers asking 4.7 million Chiang currency per US dollar. Other commodities have also uniformly increased in price. Laundries have announced a doubling of prices, hotel room rates have increased by 90 percent, and public utilities and transportation have increased sharply. Shanghai water, electricity and other public utilities, after announcing a price increase of 29 to 35 percent on the 14th of last month, announced another price increase of 80 to 190 percent on the 4th of this month, an increase of one to three times compared to 20 days ago. Chiang's "state-run" transportation services such as aviation, shipping, and postal services have also successively announced price increases (according to this, it is the second price increase in less than a month since June 7th). It is estimated that "China" and "Central" airlines have increased by 100 to 220 percent since July 2nd, the post office increased by 200 percent, and passenger and freight shipping increased by 80 percent of the original price since June 29th. It is expected that the price increase of public utilities and transportation will stimulate a more violent rise in prices. Wu Guozhen, the Chiang-appointed mayor of Shanghai, has resigned due to his inability to cope with this situation.

　　蒋区物价涨风又起
    上海米价达两千六百万
    【新华社陕北九日电】据各方消息：蒋区物价大涨风自上月二十六日达到最高峰后，间歇期仅一周，新的涨风又已掀起。六月底至七月初物价的短期轻微回跌，系由于各银行年中结帐，银根吃紧所致。据美联及合众社报导：本月三日上海米价又创两千六百万元（蒋币——下同）的新纪录，较上次涨风的最高价上涨二百万元，而为抗战前米价的二百六十万倍。美汇黑市亦已回涨，卖者喊价已至每一美元兑蒋币四百七十万元。其他商品也一致喊涨。各洗衣店已宣布加价两倍，旅馆房租增收百分之九十，公用及交通事业亦大涨特涨：上海水、电等各项公用事业，自上月十四日宣布加价百分之二十九至三十五后，本月四日又宣布加价百分之八十至一百九十不等，较二十天前已加价一倍至三倍。航空、轮船、邮政等项蒋记“国营”交通事业亦相继宣布加价（按此为六月七日以来，不到一个月的第二次加价），计“中国”、“中央”两航空公司自七月二日起加百分之百至二百二十不等，邮局增加百分之二百，轮船客运货运自上月二十九日起照原价加百分之八十，预料公用及交通事业之加价，将刺激物价更猛烈上涨。蒋记上海市长吴国桢，因无能应付此一局势，曾提出辞职。
