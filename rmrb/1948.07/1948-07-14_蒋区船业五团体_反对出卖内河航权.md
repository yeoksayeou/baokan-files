Xinhua News Agency, North China, 12th: According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on June 25th, a special dispatch from Shanghai reported that five national employee groups, including marine engine operators, navigators, pilots, and ship radio operators, held a joint meeting on June 23rd. Regarding "U.S. aid materials going directly to Nanjing and Hankou," they unanimously agreed that it "harms our inland river navigation rights" and decided that "if necessary, pilots will refuse to guide." The meeting also decided to write to U.S. Ambassador Stuart, opposing the U.S. policy of supporting Japan to threaten China.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on June 15th, the Chiang government is selling China's inland river navigation rights to the United States. The "sailing" measures include: (1) Foreign ships sailing to Nanjing and Hankou are allowed to transport U.S. aid materials directly shipped from foreign ports to China; (2) When returning from Nanjing and Hankou, they are allowed to load export goods directly shipped abroad; (3) The above ships only need to submit a list of the goods they intend to carry to the government for approval before sailing; (4) The above measures are only limited to foreign ships flying the U.S. flag, and other countries are not allowed to follow the example. This means allowing U.S. ships to freely navigate China's inland rivers, monopolize China's import and export shipping, and destroy China's private shipping industry. The newspaper confirmed that the Chiang government's sale of China's inland river navigation rights is one of the "attached conditions" of U.S. aid to Chiang. The Chiang government also "forced shipping companies not to publicize it externally."

　　蒋区船业五团体
    反对出卖内河航权
    【新华社华北十二日电】据天津大公报六月二十五日载该报上海专电，带全国性的轮机、驾驶、引水人员及船舶无线电人员等五个职工团体于六月二十三日举行联席会议，对于“美援物资直驶南京、汉口”，一致认为“有损我内河航权”，决定“必要时引水人员将拒绝领航”。会议并决定致书美国大使司徒雷登，反对美国扶植日本威胁中国的政策。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据六月十五日上海大公报披露：蒋政府将中国内河航权出卖给美国，其所定“开航”办法包括：（一）航行南京、汉口的外国船只，准装运自国外口岸直接运华的美援物资；（二）自南京、汉口回航时，准装载直接运往国外的出口货；（三）上述船只只须在航行前，将拟载货物开列清单，呈报政府核准；（四）上述办法仅限于悬美国国旗的外国船只，其他国家不得援例。这即是允许美国船只自由航行中国内河，垄断中国的输出入航运，摧毁中国的民营航业。该报证实蒋政府对于中国内河航权之出卖，系美援蒋“附带条件之一”。蒋政府并“强令航商对外不得声张”。
