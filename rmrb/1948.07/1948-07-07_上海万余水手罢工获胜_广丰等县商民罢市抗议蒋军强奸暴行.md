Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. According to reports from various foreign news agencies, 12,000 tugboat and barge sailors in Shanghai began a strike on June 28th to demand wage increases. On the second day, dockworkers in the city also launched a strike in support. On that day, six ships had ceased operations, including at least two American ships, the "Rogers Mountain" and the "Klondike." As the management was forced to agree to the workers' demands for wage increases, the sailors and dockworkers resumed work on the 2nd. The strike of 2,000 Jianghai Customs employees, which began on June 18th, still had half of the employees not returning to work by the fourth day. Their demands were to restore the "Welfare Association" formed by the employees that had been unreasonably dissolved and to improve their treatment. According to a special dispatch from Guangzhou in the Tianjin Republican Daily on June 3rd, workers in various industries in Guangzhou had also demanded "payment in rice" to increase their compensation due to soaring prices, and strike incidents occurred frequently. Labor disputes in the sewing, hotel, tea shop, flour, and rice milling industries have not yet been resolved.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to delayed Tianjin newspaper reports, disturbances and strikes broke out in Guangfeng, Yushan, and Shangrao in eastern Jiangxi to protest the rape of women by Chiang Kai-shek troops. In early May, a tragic incident occurred in Guangfeng County in which wounded Chiang Kai-shek soldiers gang-raped a female student from the Mi Jia Ling area, resulting in her death. After the atrocity, the local people were extremely angry. On the night of the 8th, more than a hundred enraged people gathered to attack the barracks of the "Veterans' Recuperation Institute" five miles from the city, capturing five Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, forcing the personnel of the institute to flee to the city in panic. When news of the Chiang Kai-shek troops' atrocities spread to the city, merchants and residents throughout the city also went on strike on the 10th to protest. An atrocity incident by Chiang Kai-shek troops also occurred near Zaotou Town in Shangrao County. On the morning of the 13th, six wounded Chiang Kai-shek soldiers raped a tea-picking girl until she was on the verge of death. Upon hearing the news, the villagers were greatly angered. With the sound of gongs, more than a dozen villagers chased and grabbed the wounded soldiers who had raped the girl and beat them. Afterwards, Chiang Kai-shek troops attempted to retaliate and committed atrocities everywhere. At 12:00 on the morning of the 17th, dozens of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, without asking any questions, beat three farmers working in the fields to death with clubs, further enraging the villagers. Furthermore, on May 17th, two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers broke into the Ping Shurong family's room in the Tianran Hotel in Yushan City and attempted rape. Upon hearing the news, Ping was extremely indignant and immediately gathered four armed guards to return to the hotel and fire warning shots at the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. At this time, all the wounded soldiers in the city gathered and surrounded the hotel, wielding weapons and beating anyone they saw, causing an uproar throughout the city. Merchants and residents immediately went on strike to protest.

    【新华社陕北四日电】据各外国通讯社报导，上海拖船及驳船水手一万二千人，为要求增加工资，于六月廿八日起开始罢工。至第二日，该市码头工人亦已发动罢工，以为声援。当日已有六艘轮船停航，其中至少包括两艘美轮，即“罗吉尔斯山号”与“开采热潮号”。由于资方已被迫答应工人增资要求，水手及码头工人已于二日复工。江海关职员两千人于六月十八日开始的罢工，至第四日，仍有半数未复工。他们提出的要求是恢复已被无理解散的为职员所组成的“福利协会”和改善待遇。据天津民国日报六月三日广州专电：广州各业工人亦因物价飞涨，曾要求“以米折薪”提高待遇，罢工事件迭起，缝工、旅店、茶店、面粉、碾谷等业劳资纠纷迄未解决。
    【新华社陕北六日电】据迟到的津报消息：江西东部的广丰、玉山、上饶相继爆发抗议蒋军强奸妇女暴行的骚动及罢市。广丰县于五月上旬发生蒋军伤兵轮奸该县米家岭女学生毙命惨案，暴行发生后，当地人民均愤怒万分。八日深夜，一百多个激怒的群众集合起来，袭击距城五里的“荣军教养院”营房，捉去蒋军五人，迫使该院人员狼狈逃往城内。蒋军暴行消息传至城内后，全城商民亦于十日全体罢市抗议。上饶县皂头镇附近亦发生蒋军暴行事件，十三日上午蒋军伤兵六人将一采茶少女强暴轮奸，直到该少女奄奄一息。村民闻讯大愤，锣声一响，十余村民追去扭住奸淫少女的伤兵就打。事后蒋军企图报复，四出行凶，十七日上午十二时，蒋军数十人，不问情由，即把在田里工作的三个农民用乱棍打死，乡民群情更为激愤。又蒋军二人于五月十七日闯入玉山城城内的天然旅馆老板平树荣眷属房内企图强奸，平闻讯愤极，当纠集枪丁四名返馆内向蒋军鸣枪警告，此时全市伤兵竟全体集合将该旅馆包围，手执凶器，见人即行殴砍，全城哗然。商民当即全体罢市抗议。
