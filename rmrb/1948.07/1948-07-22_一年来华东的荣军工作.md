　　Since the East China Party, government, and military organs issued the "Decision on Strengthening the Work of Giving Preferential Treatment to Veterans" and the "Decision on Unifying and Strengthening the Work of Honoring Military Personnel in East China" in April last year, the work of veteran affairs has achieved great success in the past year.

　　First, the East China General Administration of Honoring Military Personnel, the East China General School of Honoring Military Personnel, and ten branch bureaus and offices of honoring military personnel, nineteen schools, sanatoriums, reformatories, training regiments, and preferential treatment sections for honoring military personnel in some areas, as well as veteran affairs work groups in various places, were established. In the work, the method of letting veterans manage and educate themselves as much as possible was implemented. At present, 90% of the staff are veterans.

　　Second, veterans have received good recuperation and security after recovering from their injuries. When the Chiang army launched a key offensive against Shandong last year, the schools for honoring military personnel took the initiative to transfer on a large scale to safe areas, and implemented "relying on the masses, persisting on the spot and dispersed" in the most difficult times. Although they had difficulty moving and their languages were not very compatible, they suffered no damage in the enemy's offensive because of the good relationship between the military and the people. During the decentralized preparations for war, they helped the masses with production, covered the transfer of the masses, coached the militia, stood guard, participated in battles, uncovered secret agents, conducted propaganda, and persisted in learning.

　　Third, veterans who had recovered their health were mobilized to return to the front line, replenish the troops, or participate in rear work. In one year, there were 15,000 people. Many of them were veteran fighters and cadres who had been tested in battle and learning, and played a backbone role in the troops. For example, Wang Jingtang, who was originally a clerk at a school for honoring military personnel, became a company commander when he went to the front and became a combat hero in the Haiyang battle.

　　Fourth, the three major programs of streamlining, saving, and clearing up materials were implemented. They voluntarily lowered their living standards and enthusiastically donated money and materials to support the front. Some schools and organs also implemented self-transport of grain and grass, self-milling of grain, and production savings. The Eighth School for Honoring Military Personnel gathered more than 630,000 catties of firewood in one march. The first brigade of the Seventh School for Honoring Military Personnel spun thread and earned more than 3.8 million yuan, and cleared out a large number of organ assets.

　　Fifth, the unity between the military and the people was strengthened, and the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers serving the people was maintained and developed. Under the slogans of "Help with whatever you can do" and "Help with whatever the masses need," they helped the masses with production. The nine schools for honoring military personnel harvested a total of 14,600 mu, carried 667,000 dan of water, and provided 457,800 dan and 52,000 carts of manure. Comrade Jiang Xuewen, who was deaf in both ears, helped the masses sharpen 1,911 pairs of scissors. The four schools for honoring military personnel plastered 14,923 houses for the masses. At the same time, they saved civilian manpower, compensated for the losses of the masses, and strengthened the connection between the military and the people. The Fifth School for Honoring Military Personnel originally used 185 civilian workers as cooks, but last year all were taken over by veteran comrades. The Seventh School for Honoring Military Personnel publicized 224 times through speeches and meetings, with a total of 80,000 people participating.

　　Sixth, the learning enthusiasm and political and cultural level of the veterans were improved. The pessimistic, disappointed, arrogant, and hedonistic views of a few veterans were overcome, and their class consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm were improved. Illiteracy was generally eliminated. In the first squadron of the Fourth School for Honoring Military Personnel, only 5% of the people were illiterate. Among the 1,098 veterans who were originally illiterate in the Third School for Honoring Military Personnel, 127 people can now recognize 700 to 2,800 characters, and 971 people can write practical documents and notes. The veterans all used most of their disability pensions to buy books and pens.

　　The East China veteran affairs work has achieved many of the above achievements in the past year due to the implementation of the correct policy of centralized management and education, and the separate use of talents. However, because it has been in a tense war situation and transfer actions for the past year, and because veteran affairs work is still a new job with insufficient experience, and some cadres have insufficient understanding of veteran affairs work, there are still some shortcomings in the work. Therefore, there are still areas that need to be improved urgently in veteran affairs work. At present, the war situation is developing rapidly, and most of the schools for honoring military personnel have concentrated and summarized the work of the past year, and have gained more experience. The work of veteran affairs is more urgently needed to be strengthened. The East China Bureau and the East China Veterans Affairs Committee have now decided to strengthen veteran education and train veterans to become various construction talents. The East China General School for Honoring Military Personnel is also holding the first East China Veterans Congress to discuss how to implement the decisions of the East China Bureau and the Veterans Affairs Committee.

### 一年来华东的荣军工作

　　一年来华东的荣军工作
    华东党、政、军机关去年四月发出“加强优待荣军工作的决定”及“统一和加强华东荣誉军人工作决定”后，一年来荣军工作获得很大成绩。
    第一、建立了华东荣誉军人管理总局、华东荣誉军人总校及十个荣管分局、办事处，十九个荣校、休养院、教养院、教导团及部分地区的政府的荣誉军人优待科和各地荣誉军人小组等荣军工作组织。在工作中，贯彻了尽量由荣誉军人自己管理。教育自己的办法。目前工作人员中，百分之九十是荣誉军人。
    第二、使荣誉军人在伤愈后获得很好的休养和保障。去年蒋军向山东进行重点进攻时，各荣校主动地大规模地转移至安全地带，在最困难时则实行“依靠群众，就地分散坚持”。他们虽然行动不便，语言不很相通，但因军民关系好，故在敌人进攻中毫无损伤。在分散备战中，他们帮助群众生产，掩护群众转移，教练民兵，站岗放哨，参加战斗，破获特务，进行宣传和坚持学习。
    第三、动员身体已恢复健康的荣誉军人重上前线，充实部队或参加后方工作，在一年中有一万五千人。其中有许多经过战斗考验和学习的老战士和干部在部队中起了骨干作用。例如王京堂原在荣校任事务长，到了前方当了连长，并在海阳战斗中当了战斗英雄。
    第四、执行精简、节约、清理资材三大方案，自动降低生活水平，热烈献金、献物支援前线，部分学校机关并实行自运粮草、自磨粮食和生产节约。八荣校在一次行军中即打柴六十三万余斤。七荣校一大队纺线赚钱三百八十余万元，并清理出大批机关资财。
    第五、加强军民团结，保持和发挥了革命军人为人民服务的光荣传统。他们在“会什么的帮什么”及“群众要什么帮什么”的口号下，帮助群众生产，九个荣校共收割一万四千六百亩，挑水六十六万七千担，出粪、倒粪四十五万七千八百担又五万二千车。两耳失聪的姜学文同志帮助群众磨剪刀一九一把，四个荣校为群众泥房子一四、九二三间。同时，他们又节约民力，赔偿群众损失和加强军民联系。五荣校原用民工一八五人当炊事员，去年全部由荣军同志担任。七荣校用演讲、开会方式宣传了二二四次，总计有八万群众参加。
    第六、提高了荣军的学习情绪和政治、文化水平。克服了少数荣誉军人的悲观失望、自高自大和享乐观点，提高了他们的阶级觉悟和革命积极性。一般地消灭了文盲，四荣校一中队文盲只剩百分之五，三荣校一、○九八个原不识字的荣军，现能认字七百至二千八百的有一二七人，能写应用文、便条的有九七一人。荣誉军人都把大部分的残废金用之于买书买笔等上面。
    一年来的华东荣军工作由于执行了集中管理教育，分别量才使用的正确方针，因而获得以上的许多成绩。但是由于一年来经常处于战局紧张转移行动中；又因为荣军工作还是一个新的工作，经验不足，有些干部对荣军工作的认识不足，工作上还有些缺点，因此荣军工作还有急待改进的地方。目前战争形势迅速开展，大部荣校已集中和检查总结了过去一年的工作，获得了更多的经验。荣军工作更迫切需要加强。华东局和华东荣委会现已决定加强荣军教育，培养荣军成为各种建设人材。华东荣军总校并正举行华东第一次荣军大会，讨论如何贯彻华东局和荣委会的决定。　　　　　　　　　　【新华社华东十八日电】
