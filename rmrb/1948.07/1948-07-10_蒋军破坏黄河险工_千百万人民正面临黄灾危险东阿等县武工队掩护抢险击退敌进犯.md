Xinhua News Agency, North China, 6th: The four major key levee projects on the south bank of the Yellow River along the Hebei-Shandong border, namely Gao Village and Liu Village in northeast Dongming, Zhukou in northwest Heze, and Linpuji west of Juancheng, have been repeatedly sabotaged since February this year by Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed in Juancheng, Heze, and Dongming, and by bandits and special agents under their direction. The construction materials collected by our Yellow River Conservancy Commission Repair and Defense Office along the river in preparation for repairs have also been repeatedly robbed and burned. Now that the Yellow River flood season has arrived, each key project faces a dangerous situation. Due to the destructive crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, millions of people in Henan and Shandong are facing the danger of a serious Yellow River flood. The situation of Chiang Kai-shek's troops destroying various important key projects is described as follows:

The Jiangsu Dam of the famous Linpuji key project was severely damaged three times on February 24-25, March 17, and April 15. The ice-protection piles (wooden piles placed in the water to protect the dike slope, 12 feet long, 8 piles per row) of the second, third, fourth, and fifth dams were cut down by 80 rows in the first instance, and another 150 rows were cut down the second time. Approximately 1.1 million catties of accumulated straw material was burned, and 40,000 catties of straw material, 510 hemp ropes, more than 8,000 catties of hemp skin, 18,000 wooden piles, and a large quantity of wood were robbed. 17.8 cubic meters of stone material was thrown into the river. Seventy large fishing piles (each weighing 30 catties) on the old second dam were also cut and thrown into the river, causing both the new and old second dams to sag. (The phenomenon of a dam or dike slope sinking is called sagging. After sagging, the dam or dike slope may be washed away, and the Yellow River water will directly strike the riverbank, causing a breach.) In the first half of April, Chiang Kai-shek's entire 68th Division and the puppet Juancheng Brigade attacked our repair workers four times in succession, forcing us to suspend work. Since May, Chiang Kai-shek's entire 55th Division has been harassing the dam daily with small units, and has also built bunkers on the old second dam, dismantling many wooden piles. On May 12, they also robbed 210,000 catties of straw material that we had stored in Juntun (north of Juancheng).

The Gao Village key project was also continuously sabotaged twice by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in late February. Twenty important iron ropes on the seventh dam were cut. After we repaired it, a unit of Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Division invaded the area again on April 16, cutting ten iron ropes and throwing them into the river. On April 19, nine armed Chiang Kai-shek plainclothes men destroyed the willow piles of the fourth dam and threw them into the river, cutting all the iron ropes and hemp ropes of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh dams. The seventh dam immediately sagged, and the water overflowed the dam by three Chinese inches. While our Repair and Defense Office was preparing to repair it, the enemy from Dongming occupied Gao Village, making it impossible for us to start construction, resulting in 15 meters of the dike slope of the seventh dam being washed away. At the end of April, willow bundles more than a foot long from that dam were found washed downstream. On April 21, 60,000 catties of straw material stored in the village were robbed. On May 12, Chiang Kai-shek's 55th Division robbed another 40,000 catties of straw material from the dam of the key project. At the same time, on April 20, our material transport boat, the Laojuntang, upstream of Gao Village, was also burned by Chiang Kai-shek's troops.

The Zhukou and Liu Village key projects were sabotaged by the enemy in the first half of April, and all the iron ropes and hemp ropes on the dike slopes were cut and thrown into the river. On April 21, 4,000 catties of willow bundles stored in Liu Village were also burned. All the above four major key projects have been severely damaged, and Chiang Kai-shek's planes have been constantly bombing and strafing along the river, hindering our emergency repair work. Since the beginning of spring, according to incomplete statistics, 56 of our dike workers have been killed or injured in bombings and strafing. The key projects on the south bank have been damaged and are in an unrepairable state, with continuous sagging and dangerous situations occurring.

[Ji Luyu Telegraph] The Dong'a and Hexi Armed Work Teams, Small Teams Two and Nine, covered the emergency repair and transport of stone boats, repelling multiple incursions by an enemy five times our size. At 8:00 AM on the 21st, our stone transport contingent arrived at Wangkoushan, Henan (belonging to Pingyin), from a certain location to transport stone. The armed work teams occupied the Liushantou area for vigilance. More than 250 men of the 5th Security Brigade of the enemy in Dong'a, Liuhequan, and other places, with six machine guns, suddenly launched an attack on us in four directions. Zhang, a cadre of the Dong'a Armed Forces Department, and Captain Jing led their teams in courageous resistance, resolutely blocking an enemy five times our size. Two enemy planes also intruded into the airspace above the stone transport ferry at this time, strafing wildly. Our Section Chiefs Xin and Gu braved the enemy's bullets and worked hard with the boatmen to sail the boats back to the north bank. After 40 minutes, the armed work teams, seeing that the transport boats had returned to shore, withdrew in separate directions. The enemy planes continued to bomb, harassing us up to nine times a day, but fortunately, our stone transport boats had been dispersed and hidden, and were not damaged.

　　蒋军破坏黄河险工
    千百万人民正面临黄灾危险东阿等县武工队掩护抢险击退敌进犯
    【新华社华北六日电】黄河南岸冀鲁界上的四大河堤险工，即东明东北的高村、刘庄，菏泽西北的朱口及鄄城以西的临濮集，自今年二月以来即迭遭盘踞鄄城、菏泽、东明的蒋军及其指使的匪特破坏。我黄委会修防处运集沿河一带准备修险之工料亦迭遭抢劫、焚毁。现黄河大汛期已届，各险工险象环生。由于蒋军的破坏罪行，豫、鲁千百万人民正面临严重黄灾的危险。现将蒋军破坏各重要险工情形，分述如下：临濮集著名险工的江苏坝，于二月二十四日至二十五日，三月十七日、四月十五日被连续三次大破坏。该处第二、三、四、五坝的凌排桩（下于水中掩护堤埽的木桩。长丈二，八根一排）第一次被砍去八十多排，第二次又被砍去一百五十排。积存秸料被焚毁约一百一十万斤，被抢去秸料四万斤、麻绳五百一十条、麻皮八千多斤、木桩一万八千根及大批木料。石料十七·八方被抛入河内。老二坝上的大捞桩七十条（每条重三十斤）亦被割抛入河内。致新、老二坝均掉垫。（坝或埽发生下坠现象为掉垫。掉垫后，坝埽可能被冲走，黄水就会直扑河堤，发生决口。）四月上半月，蒋军整六十八师及伪鄄城大队先后袭击我抢修员工四次，使我被迫停工。五月以来，蒋军整五十五师逐日以小部队至坝上骚扰，又在老二坝上筑碉，拆去木桩甚多。五月十二日又抢去我积存于军屯（鄄城以北）的秸料廿一万斤。高村险工于二月下旬亦被蒋特连续破坏两次，第七坝重要铁绳被割断二十根。经我修复后，四月十六日蒋军六十八师一部又侵至该地，将铁绳割断十根，抛入河内。四月十九日蒋军便衣武装九人，又将第四坝柳桩破坏投入河内，第四、五、六、七各坝所有铁绳、麻绳全部割断。第七坝当即掉垫，坝上漫水三公寸。我修防处正拟修复，东明敌即窜踞高村，使我无法兴工；致第七坝的埽被冲走十五公尺。四月底下游又发现该坝丈多长的柳把子被水冲下。四月廿一日该村所存秸料六万斤被抢走。五月十二日蒋军五十五师又将该险工坝上的秸料抢走四万斤。同时，四月二十日高村上游老君堂我运料船一只亦遭蒋军焚毁。朱口、刘庄两险工于四月上半月被敌破坏，坝埽上的铁绳、麻绳被全部割断抛入河内。四月二十一日刘庄所存柳把四千斤又遭焚毁。上述四大险工均遭严重破坏，蒋机则不断沿河轰炸、扫射，阻我抢险工程。入春以来我堤上员工在轰炸、扫射下，据不完全统计死伤达五十六人。南岸险工被破坏，处于无法修复状态，不断发生掉垫出险。
    【冀鲁豫电】东阿、河西武工队二、九小队掩护抢险运石船只，击退五倍于我之敌的多路进犯。二十一日上午八时，我运石大队由某地到河南望口山（平阴属）运石，武工队占据刘山头一带警戒。东阿、柳河圈等地之敌保安五旅二百五十余人，机枪六挺，突分四路向我进攻，东阿武装部张干事、靖队长率队奋勇抵抗，坚决阻击五倍于我之敌。敌机两架亦于此时窜入运石渡口上空，疯狂扫射，我辛、顾二股长冒敌弹雨，与水手努力将船驶回北岸。四十分钟后，武工队以运输船已回岸，遂分路撤退。敌机仍继续轰炸，一天袭扰达九次之多，幸我运石船只已分散隐蔽，未受损失。
