The Purely Relief-Oriented Viewpoint Lacks Investigation and Research
　　Problems Arise with Loans in the Pingxi Area
[Chahar News] This spring, Pingxi issued a large number of agricultural loans to solve the various difficulties faced by the masses in spring plowing and sowing, to support the masses in developing sideline production, and to overcome the spring famine, which played a significant role. When the masses in Baoshui Village, Fangshan, were worried about having nothing to eat and no way to cultivate the land, the government issued 5,000 catties of loan grain to the village, organized manpower and livestock, and planted all the land in the village in 20 days. In the severely disaster-stricken first district of Liangxiang, 81 head of livestock were purchased with loan grain to support spring plowing and sowing. However, in the issuance of loans, considerable deviations occurred in many places: some propaganda for agricultural loans was too exaggerated, and many people relied solely on agricultural loans, complaining about the government for lending too little. For example, some district cadres in Changwan promoted to the masses that "you can borrow as much as you want, and you can borrow whatever you want." One small village requested loans of four to five million yuan. Because the number was too large, they were asked to reinvestigate several times, which caused resentment and dissatisfaction among the masses. Later, the county only allowed a loan of 4 million yuan, which the masses considered too little. After explanation, they finally took the loan. In Laishui, some district cadres promoted to the masses that "those who did not overturn themselves in the land reform can use more loans." The masses mistakenly believed that borrowing grain and money was a form of relief, and Pingtingshan Village, with more than 50 households, requested a loan of 100 million yuan. Before the issuance of agricultural loans, due to a lack of investigation and research and insufficient understanding of the situation, the focus was determined subjectively, which was inconsistent with the actual situation. Muzigang Village in Huailai was the poorest and only received a loan of 2 million yuan and 3 large stones of grain, while Zhuanggou Village, which was very wealthy, received a loan of 5 million yuan and 6 large stones of grain. In some places, the issuance of loans was not taken seriously. The agricultural loans in two districts of Fangshan were directly controlled and issued by the county without any review by the districts. They were introduced to the county without district screening, and the county lent the money without review, resulting in loans being given to many who should not have received them. Many places distributed the money evenly. Huangta Village in Wanping divided the loaned grain at a rate of 11.5 jin per person. Cadres in the second and third districts of Laizhou were afraid of being criticized for lending incorrectly, so they delayed issuing the loaned grain. The second district had not distributed the agricultural loans for more than a month. Some areas did not check after issuing loan grain and money and did not organize production, so the loans did not play their due role. Anjiagai Village in the first district of Huailai used the loans to engage in transportation and sales, and the director of the new peasant association even said, "This loan is given by the government to the cadres because the cadres delay production." The masses were very dissatisfied.

### 单纯救济观点缺乏调查研究　平西贷款出了毛病

　　单纯救济观点缺乏调查研究
    平西贷款出了毛病
    【察哈尔讯】今春平西发放大批农贷，解决群众春耕播种中的各种困难，扶助群众开展副业生产，渡过春荒，曾起了不少作用。房山宝水庄群众正发愁没吃的、没法种地时，政府发给该村五千斤贷粮，把人畜力组织起来，在廿天中将全村的土地全部种上。良乡灾惨重的一区各村，用贷粮购买八十一头牲畜，支持了春耕下种。但在发放贷款中，不少地方发生了相当的偏向：有的对农贷的宣传太夸大，好多群众单纯依靠农贷，嫌农贷少而埋怨政府。如昌宛有的区干部向群众宣传说：“贷多少给多少，贷什么给什么”，有一个小村就要求贷四、五千万元。因为数字太大，让他们重新调查了好几次，结果引起群众的厌烦和不满，后来县里只允许贷给四百万元，群众嫌少，经过解释后，才贷了去。涞水有的区干部向群众宣传说：“在土改中没翻了身的，可多使贷款。”群众误认为贷粮贷款是一笔救济，五十多户的平顶山村就要求贷一亿元。在农贷发放前，由于缺乏调查研究，对情况了解不够，主观的确定重点，和实际情况不符。怀来木子港村最穷、只贷到款二百万元，贷粮三大石；很富裕的庄户村却贷款五百万元，贷粮六大石。有的地方对贷款发放不认真。房山有两个区的农贷，是由县直接掌握发放，区里不加审查。就往县里介绍，县里也不审查就贷给，结果好多不应贷的都贷了。不少地方是平均分配，宛平黄塔村按每人十一斤半分了贷粮。涞涿二、三区干部怕贷错了受批评，将贷粮搁着不放，二区把农贷放了一个多月还没有发放下去。有的地区发下贷粮贷款不检查，不组织生产，致使农贷未起到应有的作用。怀来一区安家碍村领回贷，村干部就用贷款搞起运销来，新农会主任还说：“这款是政府贷给干部的，因为干部耽误生产。”群众很不满意。
