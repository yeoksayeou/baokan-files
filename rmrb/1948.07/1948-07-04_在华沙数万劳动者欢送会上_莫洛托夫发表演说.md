Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. TASS reports: Tens of thousands of working people in the Polish capital gathered at the airport on the 25th in the rain to bid farewell to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and other foreign ministers who participated in the Warsaw Conference. Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz and ministers also went to the airport to see them off. Cyrankiewicz delivered a speech at the airport stating: The resolutions passed by the Warsaw Conference prove that the unity of countries acting in the interests of ensuring common security has been further strengthened. Imperialists and instigators of war still underestimate the desire for peace among their own people. What the Warsaw Conference said represents these people of all countries and all those who strive for peace. Molotov was then invited to deliver a speech, saying: "The declaration of the Warsaw Conference states what the people of Europe, including the German people, should not allow in order to prevent the resurgence of German aggression; it also states what countries need to consolidate peace and accelerate the post-war economic recovery of European countries. The declaration clearly states that only the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries can propose such a solution to the German question that meets the interests of all countries and truly serves the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism." After bidding farewell to the people of Warsaw, Molotov took a plane back to Moscow.

　　在华沙数万劳动者欢送会上
    莫洛托夫发表演说
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社报导：波兰首都数万劳动人民于二十五日冒雨在机场集会，欢送苏外长莫洛托夫和参加华沙会议的其他各国外长。波兰总理西伦凯维兹暨各部部长亦赴机场送行。西伦凯维兹在机场发表演说称：华沙会议通过的决议证明：为保证共同安全的利益而行动的各国，其团结是进一步的加强了。帝国主义和战争挑拨者，至今仍低估了其国内人民对和平的愿望。华沙会议说的话，便是代表各国这些人民和一切为和平而奋斗的人们。莫洛托夫继而被邀发表演说称：“华沙会议的宣言说明：为了防止德国侵略的再起，欧洲各国人民，包括德国人民在内，所不应允许的是什么；同时也说明：为巩固和平与加速欧洲各国战后的经济复兴，各国所需要的是什么。宣言明确的说明：只有苏联和新民主主义国家，才能提出这种切合一切国家的利益，而且真正为和平、民主及社会主义事业服务的对德问题方案。”莫洛托夫向华沙人民告别之后，即乘机返回莫斯科。
