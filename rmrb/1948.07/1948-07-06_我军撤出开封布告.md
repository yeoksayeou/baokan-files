Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, June 28th (delayed dispatch): The People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from Kaifeng on June 26th. The Front Headquarters Political Department also issued a proclamation, the full text of which is as follows:

Following the liberation of Kaifeng, with the joint protection and efforts of our military and civilians, order in the urban area has been initially restored, and relief and reconstruction work is underway. However, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek's ambition has not died, and he attempts to gather bandit troops to re-invade Kaifeng, determined to subject Kaifeng to complete destruction. Our army, witnessing the tragedies caused by the destruction and indiscriminate bombing of Chiang's army and aircraft, could not bear to see the city's elders and brothers suffer the trauma of war again. Therefore, we had to make a temporary withdrawal from the urban area. We remember that the people of our city have long suffered oppression and devastation from Chiang's bandits. During the liberation of Kaifeng, Chiang's bandits occupied merchants' buildings and residences, resisting stubbornly street by street, and setting fires during their retreat, followed by a frenzy of indiscriminate bombing. This resulted in many prosperous urban areas being reduced to ashes, and many elders and brothers were tragically injured or killed. Nevertheless, people from all walks of life and the suburbs assisted our army in combat amidst gunfire and explosions, providing enthusiastic support, and helped our army maintain order and transport supplies after the battle. They also sincerely supported the various policies and principles of our Party and our army, which further strengthened the courage of the entire army to fight for the people. It is regrettable that we have not been able to properly comfort all the affected compatriots, and we have not been able to consult with our elders and brothers in detail on various construction projects, forcing us to make a temporary separation. We extend our deep gratitude to the people of the city and our sincere condolences to all the affected compatriots.

Although all comrades of our army fought bravely for the liberation of Kaifeng, shedding their blood, and maintained the tradition of protecting the city and cherishing the people during the fighting, due to the short time, what we could contribute to the people of our city was still limited. Individual personnel also violated policies and discipline, and our army hereby expresses its sincere apology.

What can be comforting to the elders and brothers of our city is that Kaifeng will ultimately belong to the people. Our army's temporary withdrawal is solely due to our love for the city and the people, so as to seek opportunities to annihilate the enemy in large numbers, thereby finally securing Kaifeng. Our army could capture Kaifeng this time, and we can liberate Kaifeng at any time in the future. The re-capture of Luoyang and its embarkation on the road to construction is proof of this. At present, our People's Liberation Army is launching a victorious offensive throughout the country. Chiang's bandits cannot reverse their irreversible defeat. Even in the Central Plains battlefield, where Chiang's bandits are piecing together all their forces to desperately contend, they are shrinking their forces and abandoning cities under the iron fists of our Liu-Deng, Chen-Su, and Chen-Xie armies. Not only can the People's Liberation Army capture Kaifeng, but it will also powerfully seize all major cities in the country. The victory of the people's revolutionary war is not far away. We would like to take this opportunity to wish the people of Kaifeng eternal liberation.

The enthusiastic love and care of the people of the city for our army will never be forgotten by our army, and we will strive to fight for the liberation of Kaifeng, the liberation of the Central Plains, and the liberation of all of China. We sincerely hope that the people of the city will temporarily endure the pain of Chiang's bandits' return, inherit the glory of resisting tyranny and striving for liberation in the past, and wage an unyielding struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique. If you cannot bear the devastation and cannot make a living, our Party and our army sincerely welcome people from all walks of life, including industry and commerce, education, social elites, and educated youth, to come to the liberated areas to find employment, study, and participate in various construction projects in the liberated areas, and work together to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and build a new China. As for the officials of the Kuomintang government and the responsible personnel of its affiliated economic, cultural, and other agencies, as well as all employees, we hope that they will not leave their posts without authorization when our army returns, so as not to cause unnecessary losses to these agencies due to lack of supervision. We especially hope that the broad masses of Chiang's army officers and soldiers will deeply understand the righteousness of the matter, stop risking their lives for the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique, and stop making futile resistance. They should also deeply repent of their past crimes of ravaging the people, understand the deep suffering and disasters of the people of Kaifeng, and arouse their patriotic and loving conscience to protect the people. If anyone dares to persist in evil and continue to persecute the people, our army will impose severe sanctions and treat their ringleaders as war criminals. This proclamation is hereby issued.

　　我军撤出开封布告
    【新华社开封前线六月廿八日电】（迟到）人民解放军于六月二十六日主动撤离开封。前线司令部政治部并发布文告，全文如下：查开封解放后，在我军民协力保护共同努力下，市区秩序已初告恢复，善后救济及各种建设工作，正在开始，乃蒋贼心犹未死，妄图纠集匪部，重犯开封，必欲置开封于全部毁灭而后快。本军目睹市民遭受蒋军破坏蒋机滥炸所遭致之惨祸，不忍全市父老兄弟于创巨痛深之余重受战争灾难之迫害，不得不自市区作暂时之撤退。念我全市人民长期受蒋匪压迫摧残，此次解放开封之役，复因蒋匪霸占商民建筑住宅，逐街顽抗，且由于退却时纵火焚烧，复加以疯狂滥炸，以致许多繁华市区化成灰尽，许多父老兄弟，惨受伤亡；然我各界各业及城郊人民，犹能在枪林火海中协助我军作战，热情支援，战后复协同本军维持秩序，帮助运输：对本党本军各项政策主张，更加以真挚之拥护，诚使全军上下愈益增强为人民而战之勇气。所惜被难同胞尚未能一一妥加抚恤，各项建设，尚未能与我父老同胞一一详作商量，又不能不作暂时之分离。我们谨向全市人民致以深切的感谢，谨向所有被难同胞致以亲切的慰问。本军全体同志，虽曾为解放开封英勇作战，流出了自己的鲜血，并能于作战期间保持了保护城市爱护人民的传统，但因时间短暂，所能贡献于我全市人民者还是不多，个别人员亦有违反政策纪律之处，本军对此谨表衷诚之歉仄。
    所可告慰于我全市父老同胞者，即开封终究必然要属于人民所有。我军之暂时撤离，仅缘于爱护城市，爱护人民，以便寻找战机，大量歼敌，从而最后确保开封。我军此次可以攻克开封，今后即可随时解放开封，洛阳之再次收复，并走上建设道路，即为明证。目前我人民解放军正在全国范围内展开胜利进攻，蒋匪无法挽回其永远不能翻身之败局，即就蒋匪拼凑全力妄图争夺之中原战场，亦在我刘邓、陈粟、陈谢三路大军铁拳打击下，收缩兵力，放弃城市，并且洛阳开封此等大城市也无法确保，人民解放军不惟可以攻克开封，且将有力夺取全国一切大城市，人民革命战争胜利之期，已在不远。我们愿于此预祝开封人民之永远解放。
    全市人民对本军之热情爱护，本军将永不忘记，并将为解放开封解放中原解放全中国而努力战斗。深愿全市人民暂时忍受蒋匪重来之痛苦，继承过去反抗暴政争取解放之光荣，对蒋介石统治集团作不屈不挠之斗争。设或不堪蹂躏，无法为生，则凡工商教育各界，社会贤达、知识青年，本党本军一律热诚欢迎来解放区就业就学，参加解放区各种建设工作，同为打倒蒋介石建设新中国而奋斗。对国民党政府官员及所属经济文化各种机关主管人员及一切职员，务望于我军重来时，切勿擅离职守，致使各该机关因无人看管而遭受不必要之损失，至广大蒋军官兵，尤望能深明大义，勿再为蒋介石统治集团拼死卖命，徒作无益之抵抗，并应痛悔过去摧残人民之罪恶，体念开封人民深重痛苦和灾难，激发爱国爱民之天良保护人民。倘敢怙恶不悛，继续迫害人民，则本军将加以严厉之制裁，并将其首要人员以战争罪犯论罪。此布。
