Jinnan Administrative Office Issues Instructions on Summer Production
Eliminate Wasteland, Prevent Pests, Practice Intensive and Careful Farming
[Jinnan News] The Jinnan Administrative Office issued instructions on summer production. It pointed out: (1) Continue planting after wheat harvest, replant autumn seedlings, eliminate cultivated wasteland, and strive to plant more and harvest more. For farmers who do not seize the opportunity to plant despite timely rainfall, we should educate and urge them to plant quickly. For wheat fields that are left fallow, we should call on the masses to plow quickly to facilitate planting crops and wheat. For areas with mole crickets and semi-alkaline soil, continuous replanting should be carried out. For wasteland that has been barren for many years, we should organize the masses to cultivate it, or plant alfalfa, trees, etc., to increase production and improve the soil. (2) Call on the masses to practice intensive and careful farming to increase production. We should use agricultural proverbs such as "One inch of weeding is better than fertilizer, and a good harvest fills the granary," "Weed rice four times and get good rice, weed cotton eight times and get good clothes," and "The hoe has water" to educate the masses, increase their enthusiasm for production, and increase yields. (3) Call on the masses to accumulate fertilizer and apply top dressing: "Compost several circles of fertilizer in the summer, and next year the wheat will fill the granary." We should mobilize the masses to seize the opportunity to accumulate night soil; and promote raising more livestock, breeding livestock, raising pigs, and extracting oil to greatly increase fertilizer production, which will immediately increase yields. Autumn seedlings that have not been fertilized or have received little fertilizer should be top-dressed in a timely manner to increase the autumn harvest. (4) Pay attention to pest prevention at all times: Recently, dense insects, locust nymphs, mole crickets, big-eyed bugs, etc., have occurred frequently in various places, causing great harm; cadres at all levels should work with the masses to study pest control methods and promote them well. In the future, if pests are found, immediately mobilize the masses to quickly capture and kill them. In order to complete the above calls and carry out the production movement, the following points must be noted: (1) Conscientiously implement the various policies of the higher levels, correct deviations, solve various difficulties in production, eliminate ideological obstacles in production, and improve the mood for production. (2) Widely publicize this year's burden method, explaining that whoever plants gets the harvest, cultivated wasteland is exempt from burden for one year, and barren wasteland is exempt from burden for three years; agricultural burdens are generally levied according to the standard yield per mu, without progressive increases. And we must do a good job in rationalizing wartime labor, reducing unnecessary burdens on the masses, and enabling the masses to invest heavily in production. (3) Vigorously organize mass production mutual aid to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power, but we must ensure democratic voluntarism and equivalent exchange, and prevent coercion, commandism, and formalism.

　　冀南行署指示夏季生产
    灭荒防虫精耕细作
    【冀南讯】冀南行署发出夏季生产指示。指出：（一）继续种麦茬，补种秋苗，消灭熟荒，争取多种多收。对于雨水及时但不抓紧种地的农民，我们应教育督促其很快种上。对留麦地，应号召群众快耕，以利种地种麦。对有蝼蛄和半沙碱地，应连续的补种。对很多年的荒地，要组织群众耕种，或种苜蓿、树林等，以增加生产改良土壤。（二）号召群众精耕细作，增加生产。应以：“苗锄一寸顶上粪，粮食丰收满仓囤”，“谷锄四遍二八米，棉锄八遍好织褂”，“锄头有水”等农谚教育群众，提高生产积极性，增加收成。（三）号召群众积肥、上追肥，“伏里沤上几圈粪，明年麦子收满囤”。应发动群众抓紧时机多沤圊肥；并提倡多喂牲口，繁殖牲畜，养猪，打油，大量增加肥料，上即增收。没上粪或上的少的秋苗地，应及时上追肥，以增秋收。（四）随时注意防虫：近来各地不断发生密虫，蝗蝻，蝼蛄，大眼贼等，为害很大；各级干部应结合群众，很好研究灭虫办法，很好推广。今后如发现害虫，立即动员群众迅速捕灭。为了完成上述号召，开展生产运动，必须注意以下几点：（一）认真贯彻上级各项政策，纠正偏向，解决生产中的各种困难，消除生产中的思想障碍，提高生产情绪。（二）广泛宣传今年负担办法，说明谁种谁收，开熟荒一年不纳负担，生荒三年不纳负担；农业负担，一般按标准亩常年产量征收，不加累进。并且要很好做到战勤合理，减少群众不必要的负担，使群众大力投入生产。（三）大力组织群众生产互助，解决人畜力的困难，但必须做到民主自愿等价交换，防止强迫命令“轰轰烈烈”的形式主义。
