[Taihang Telegram] In the border region of northern Henan, the Party, government, army, and people of Jiaozuo County have recently crushed three "sweeping" wheat grabs by the Chiang bandits in a row over the past month, carrying out 117 operations of various sizes, killing, wounding, and capturing over a hundred enemies, including Hou Qing, deputy head of the Xiuwu Security Regiment. Forty-six puppet soldiers and personnel were won over through disintegration. During the wheat protection battle, due to the correct implementation of policies and the combination of military offensives and political offensives, the enemy and puppets were shaken. The puppet self-defense corps of villages such as Moumou sent people to inquire: "Should we carry the guns issued by the Chiang bandits or not? Can we wear the small floral hats or not?" And said, "We will listen to whatever you say." The puppet self-defense corps of a certain village even helped us transport public grain. After a family that had fled from Nanzhang Village returned home and was properly resettled by us, they voluntarily returned to the enemy-occupied area to mobilize twenty more fleeing households to return. Many people and puppet personnel in the enemy-occupied area voluntarily requested to pay public grain to our side and did their best to support us. The fighting will of our cadres and the masses has been greatly enhanced. At the same time, due to the leadership of the cadres and the combination of labor and military affairs, the entire county's 25,000 mu of wheat were harvested in seven days, and the planting of 7,100 mu of autumn crops was completed in three days, and all grain storage work was completed within three days. At present, the situation of the struggle against the enemy in the county has changed from passive to active.

　　军事出击结合政攻焦作我军民转入主动
    【太行电】豫北边地焦作县党政军民，最近一月来连续粉碎了蒋匪三次抢麦“扫荡”，大小作战一百一十七次，毙伤俘敌修武保安团副团长侯青以下百余名，争取瓦解伪军伪人员四十六名。在护麦战中，由于正确执行政策，军事出击与政治攻势相结合，敌伪纷纷动摇，某某等村伪自卫团，均派人前来询问：“蒋匪发给的枪支叫背不叫背？花小帽能戴不能戴”。并说：“你们说啥就听啥”。某村伪自卫团并帮助我方运送公粮。南张村一家逃亡户还乡后，经我妥善安置，他就自动回到敌占区，动员回来逃亡户二十名。敌占区许多群众及伪人员，均自动要求向我方交纳公粮，并尽力支援我们。我干部与群众的斗争意志，大为提高。同时由于干部带头，劳武结合，全县二万五千亩麦子，七天打完，七千一百亩秋禾下种三天完成，并于三天内全部完成屯粮工作。现该县对敌斗争形势，已由被动变为主动。
