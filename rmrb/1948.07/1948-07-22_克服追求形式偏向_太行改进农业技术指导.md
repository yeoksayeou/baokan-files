　　Overcoming the Tendency to Pursue Form
  　Taihang Improves Agricultural Technical Guidance
    [Taihang Telegram] Taihang agricultural and forestry work overcomes the formalism of being divorced from the masses. Combining farmers' experience and adapting to local conditions, it strengthens technical guidance for agriculture. Since late spring and early summer, local agricultural and forestry bureaus, as well as county, district, and village technical experts, have held technical research meetings to examine, from top to bottom and from bottom to top, the formalism in past work of disregarding specific situations and conditions, mechanically or even forcibly promoting special crops and agricultural technologies to farmers. For example, the "Golden Queen" corn, which has been extensively promoted throughout the region since 1944, requires good geological conditions, abundant manure, sparse seedlings, and diligent weeding to yield one to three times more than ordinary local corn. However, some places with poor geological conditions and a lack of manure were also forced to promote it, resulting in lower yields than local corn. The "169" wheat, which was promoted at the same time as Golden Queen, yielded high outputs in most areas and was welcomed by farmers. However, some areas were unsuitable for planting due to climate, and jaundice occurred year after year, resulting in very poor harvests. This year, Licheng's wheat generally yielded more than one stone per mu, while the "169" wheat suffered severely from jaundice, with some ten mu yielding only a little over one stone. In addition, warm water seed soaking often failed to work or even damaged the seeds because the masses had difficulty grasping the exact time and temperature. Many of the pesticides promoted to control insect pests were simply unknown to the masses or were too expensive or unavailable for them to purchase. These phenomena were not corrected in time, and the masses often sacrificed their own interests and felt dissatisfied because they were "responding to the call" and "taking the lead," but they dared not boldly raise the issue. Although the cadres also saw this phenomenon with their own eyes, they often attributed it to the masses' lack of technical expertise and ideological resistance. After this general review, the harm of formalism was deeply recognized, and it was decided to gradually and truly combine improved varieties and improved technologies with farmers' experience to achieve the goal of increasing production. Cadres of local agricultural and forestry bureaus have gone to various counties in the second and third districts to conduct field inspections, overcome past biases, and humbly study and improve farmers' experience. When cadres of the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau assisted in wheat seed selection, they no longer forcibly promoted "169" wheat, but rather selected excellent varieties suitable for local conditions after discussion and agreement with the masses. The Shexian Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has universally promoted "Tu Mai" (bald wheat) suitable for local conditions and has organized the masses to exchange 380 shi of seeds, which can be planted on 100,000 mu. Linxian has universally promoted "Shaogu Dan" wheat, which has a 20-year history and is known as the "Scholar Wheat." It usually yields one or two dou more per mu than other wheat and is very suitable for the dry and rain-scarce natural conditions of the Linxian area. The masses like it very much. This year, Huangniuti and other villages in Lucheng generally selected "Mao Mai" (hairy wheat) seeds. This type of wheat matures early, and when jaundice occurs, it immediately produces barren ears, so the disease occurs very rarely. After repeated research and experiments, the Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau created a particularly effective, money-saving, and simple method for treating oil drought (cotton seedling pests): Grind one liang of quicklime and two liang of tobacco leaves into a fine powder and put it into 25 jin of clean water. After soaking for half a day, pour out the water, remove the lime residue, and wet the cotton seedlings one by one. The oil drought will die after one day. The masses are very satisfied with this method.

### 克服追求形式偏向　太行改进农业技术指导

　　克服追求形式偏向
  　太行改进农业技术指导
    【太行电】太行农林工作克服脱离群众的形式主义作风，结合农民经验，适合各地条件，加强对农业的技术指导。春末夏初以来，各地农林局及县区村技术能手，分别召开技术研究会，自上而下和自下而上检查过去工作中不看具体情况与条件，机械甚至强迫农民推广特种作物与农业技术的形式主义。如一九四四年以来即在全区大量推广的“金皇后”玉茭，种植条件必须地质好、粪土大、留苗稀、勤锄，可比一般土玉茭多收一至三倍；但有些地方地质既坏、粪土又缺，也非强迫推广不可，结果反而不如土玉茭打得多。与金皇后同时推广的“一六九”小麦，在大多数地区产量大，农民欢迎。但亦有些地区因气候关系不宜种植，连年发生黄疸，收成很坏。黎城今年小麦普遍收成每亩一石以上，而“一六九”小麦因黄疸病严重，竟有十亩地才收一石多的。另外如温汤浸种，亦因群众很难掌握准确的时间和温度，浸后很少顶事甚至把种籽闹坏了。推广治除虫害的药剂，有很多是群众根本不懂或无钱无处购买的。这些现象没有及时纠正，群众常因“响应号召”、“起带头作用”牺牲了自己利益心里不满，又不敢大胆提出。干部虽也亲眼看到这种现象，但往往推之于群众不会讲究技术、思想抵抗等原因。经过此次普遍检讨，深刻认识了形式主义作风的危害，决定逐步确实作到把改良品种、提高技术与农民的经验相结合，达到增产的目的。各地农林局干部已分别到二、三分区各县实地检查，克服过去偏向，虚心研究与提高农民的经验。长治农林局干部协助小麦选种时，不再强迫推广“一六九”小麦，而是经过群众讨论同意，选择适合当地的优良品种。涉县农林局普遍推广适合当地条件的“秃麦”，已组织群众调换种籽三百八十石，可种十万亩。林县普遍推广有廿年历史，被称为状元麦子的“稍谷旦”小麦，通常比其他小麦每亩多打一、二斗。并很适合林县一带少雨多旱的自然条件。群众非常喜欢。潞城黄牛蹄等村今年多普遍选择“毛麦”种籽，这种小麦成熟期早，到生黄疸病时即莠穗，病害发生很少。邢台农林局经过多次研究实验，创造出效力特大、省钱简便的治油旱（吃棉苗害虫）办法：用一两生石灰、二两烟叶研成细末，放进二十五斤清水。泡大半天，把水倒出，去掉石灰渣，一棵棵浸湿棉苗，一天后油旱即死。这办法群众非常满意。
