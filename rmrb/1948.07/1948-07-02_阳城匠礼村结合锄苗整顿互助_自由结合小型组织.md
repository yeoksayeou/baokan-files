[Taiyue News] Yangcheng Jiangli Village has reorganized its mutual aid teams in conjunction with correction of deviations, disaster relief, and weeding, gaining some experience: First, establish an organization to lead production and thoroughly rectify mutual aid teams: 1. An expanded production committee was established in the village, composed of the village head, instructor, chairman of the farmers' association, director of the armed forces committee, chairman of the women's association, manager of the cooperative, and experienced farmers and mutual aid team leaders, totaling a dozen people, to specifically lead production. Any teams that were forcibly organized last year, with forcibly assigned team leaders that the masses were dissatisfied with, were announced as freely withdrawing or dissolving after a team member meeting. 2. To facilitate sideline production, various small-scale mutual aid and cooperative organizations are freely formed, establishing a method of regular combination of agricultural and sideline industries in terms of organization and technology. 3. The masses deliberate and elect team leaders, taking the ability to organize mass production and mass support as conditions, and fully promote a democratic leadership style. 4. Each mutual aid team develops a production plan, reasonably evaluates work and determines points, formulates mutual aid rules, and promotes the role of "organizing to replace machines." 5. In order to prevent too many meetings from affecting mass production, village cadres strengthen production leadership and participate in each team's labor exchange weeding separately, combining work and production. The entire administrative village voluntarily and democratically combined into fifty-two small groups according to the above principles. Out of the village's six hundred households, only nineteen households did not participate in the mutual aid team. There are two reasons why these nineteen households did not participate: 1. Several households used to take advantage in the team and were not harmonious, and some did not implement equivalent exchange when they were team leaders, so no one wanted them this time. 2. Some households do not have labor, and others are unwilling to combine with them. The production committee is now studying how to solve the problems of these nineteen households. Second, the implementation of agricultural and sideline mutual aid production has improved everyone's enthusiasm for production and mutual assistance. According to a survey of the Tumeng Natural Village, there are the following three forms of combination of agricultural and sideline industries: 1. Jointly borrow money and hire a dedicated transporter. The transporter receives wages and food, and dividends are distributed according to shares. The mutual aid team weeds for the transporter, and the transporter pays the mutual aid team for agricultural production labor. 2. Coal mine workers go to the kiln to mine coal, and farmers weed for them and receive agricultural wages. The mutual aid team weeds for the carpenters in the group who work outside, and working for a day is 500 Jiao less than the carpenter earns outside. The carpenter eats outside, and the weeders eat their own food. In the past month or so, this combination of agricultural and sideline production has achieved great results. The masses of the three natural villages earned a total of 5 million yuan from rushing to work, going down to the coal mines, and engaging in various handicrafts including transportation, which can buy 140 dan of grain (the village lacks 70 dan of grain during the spring famine). Many people have returned the wages that were unpaid or underpaid to middle peasants, implementing the policy of correcting deviations and uniting production, making everyone feel the benefits of mutual assistance in production. Third, actively weed according to the two major principles of voluntariness and equivalent value. In terms of equivalent exchange, it is stipulated that: 1. If a household using labor lacks labor but has grain, and the worker is a household suffering from the spring famine, then rice will be returned in exchange for labor to help solve the spring famine. 2. If the household using labor has no grain and the other party is not a household suffering from the spring famine, then labor will be returned for weeding, so that the other party can squeeze out labor to engage in other sideline production. 3. If the household using labor has labor but no grain, and the other party has both labor and grain, with the consent of both parties, a labor slip can be issued to the worker, and labor can be allocated at any time to eliminate the difficulties of the labor-owing household and can be used to dispose of surplus labor. 4. If the household using labor lacks both grain and labor, and the other party has labor but no grain, in order to solve the other party's difficulties, they can first go to transport after weeding their own seedlings, and the mutual aid team will help with the remaining autumn seedlings, and wait for him to return labor later. The above four methods have been widely used by the masses. Everyone is voluntary and of equivalent value, activities are convenient, and they do not worry about each other. The enthusiasm for production has been improved, and most of the village's grain fields have been weeded within nine days, truly achieving "weeding one inch for the grain."

　　阳城匠礼村结合锄苗整顿互助
    自由结合小型组织
    【太岳讯】阳城匠礼村结合纠偏、救灾、锄苗等工作，重新整顿了互助组，取得若干经验：第一、树立领导生产的机构，彻底整顿互助组：一、在村里建立了扩大的生产委员会，由村长、指导员、农会主席、武委会主任、妇女会主席、合作社经理和富有生产经验的农民、互助组长共十数人组成，专门领导生产。凡是去年强迫编制，强迫指定组长而为群众不满意的，经过组员会议，宣布自由退出或解散。二、为便利进行副业生产，自由结合各种各样小型互助合作组织，从组织上技术上确立农副业经常结合的办法。三、群众酝酿民选组长，以组织群众生产的能力和群众拥护为条件，充分发扬民主领导作风。四、各互助组定出生产计划，合理评工定分，制定互助规矩，发扬“组织起来顶机器”的作用。五、为了防止开会太多，影响群众生产，村干部加强生产领导，分头参加各组变工锄苗，使工作和生产结合起来。全行政村根据上述原则自愿民主结合成五十二个小组，全村六百户人家，只十九户没有参加互助组。这十九户没参加的原因有两种：一、有几户过去在组里净占便宜，又不和气，有的当组长时不执行等价交换，这次结合没人要他。二、有些户没有劳力，别人不愿和他们结合，现在生产委员会正研究解决这十九户的问题。第二、施行农副业互助生产，提高了大家生产互助的情绪。根据土孟自然村调查，农副业结合的形式，共有以下三种：一、合伙贷款专人运输，运输人得工资伙食，红利按股分红，互助组给运输人锄苗，运输人向互助组付农业生产工资。二、煤窑工人到窑上挖煤，农民给他锄苗，得农业工资。互助组给本组在外的木匠工人锄苗，劳动一天比木匠在外少赚冀钞五百元，木匠吃在外边，锄苗者吃自己。月余来这种农副业的结合生产，获得很大成绩。三个自然村群众打忙工，下煤窑，进行各种手工业连同运输共赚五百万元，可买一百四十石粮食（该村春荒缺粮七十石）。许多人把进去未付或少付错斗中农的工资都还了，贯彻了纠偏和团结生产的方针，使大家在生产上感到了互助的好处。第三、按照自愿、等价两大原则主动锄苗。在等价交换方面，规定：一、使用劳力的户如果有粮食缺劳力，出工者为春荒户，就按工还米，帮助解决春荒。二、使用劳力户无粮食，而对方不是春荒户的，即还工锄苗，使对方能挤出劳力从事其他副业生产。三、使用劳力户有劳力无粮食，而对方劳力粮食均不缺乏，在双方同意下，可给出工户开付工条，随时拨工，以免除欠工户的困难，并可借以处理余工。四、使用劳力户粮食劳力两缺，而对方有劳力无粮食者，为了解决对方的困难，他在锄完自己的谷苗就可先去运输，其余秋苗由互助组帮助锄，等他以后回来还工。以上四种办法，已为群众普遍运用，大家自愿等价，活动方便，互不牵挂，生产劲头提高了，九天之内全村谷地大部锄完，真正做到了“谷锄一寸”。
