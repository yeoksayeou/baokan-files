　　Yiyuan Loujiapuzi
    Women Go Downhill to Weed the Fields
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 6th. The Loujiapuzi Village in Zhangzhuang District, Yiyuan (newly established county, northern Yishui), Shandong Province, which suffered the most from the Chiang Kai-shek disaster, organized women to participate in agricultural and sideline production, successfully overcoming the spring famine and completing the spring plowing, summer weeding, and summer planting work. The administrative village includes the three natural villages of Wazi, Longwo, and Tumenyu, with a total of 132 households. At the beginning of the spring plowing, 90 percent of the village had nothing to eat. The Party branch proposed: "Rely on women to engage in sideline occupations to earn food, and men make a concentrated effort to cultivate." Thus, 162 women were mobilized to engage in spinning and making military shoes. In two months, they earned more than 10,500 catties of wage grain, solving the problem of food for most of the people. After the spring plowing, there was a gap between the old and new crops, and the disaster situation became serious again. At this time, there was an urgent need to transplant seedlings and weed, but the wages for making shoes and spinning fell, and the income was no longer sufficient to solve the problem of food. The branch convened a meeting of party members to study how to continue earning food without delaying weeding. Everyone believed that the only way was to squeeze out male labor for transportation and odd jobs. However, after calculation, all the male labor was not enough even for weeding. There was no other way but to mobilize women to go downhill to weed. After discussion, female Party member Lou Chengju proposed to guarantee that she would go downhill herself and replace her brother to engage in sideline occupations. After further deliberation after the meeting, Wang Shenghui's group of young women, Lou Cheng’gui, Lou Cheng’xin, and others, also organized themselves. Led by experienced old farmers, they went downhill to weed. They earned 30 catties of grain a day. This achievement influenced the women of Wazi, who also organized seven people under the leadership of village cadre Fang Guiying to go downhill. The whole village quickly developed to thirteen women participating in mutual aid. Most of the women in Longwo initially emphasized that they could not go downhill because they had children, but after seeing Fang Dongyu and other four people in the village go downhill, they also organized themselves to go downhill. In this way, a total of 43 young and middle-aged women in the entire administrative village participated in mutual aid teams. The women and children of Wang Shengde's and Yang Chenggong's groups weeded more than 70 mu of seedlings in three days.

　　沂源娄家铺子
    妇女下坡锄地
    【新华社华东六日电】鲁中沂源（新设县，沂水北部）张庄区遭蒋灾最重的娄家铺子村组织妇女参加农业和副业生产，胜利渡过春荒，并完成春耕、夏锄、夏种工作。该行政村包括洼子、龙窝、土门峪三个自然村，共一三二户。春耕开始时，全村百分之九十的人没有吃的，党的支部便提出：“靠妇女搞副业挣饭吃，男人突击耕种”。于是动员了一百六十二个妇女投入纺织和做军鞋，两月中共赚工资粮一万零五百余斤，解决了大部吃粮。春耕后，青黄不接，灾情又形严重。此时急需剜苗、锄草，而做鞋、纺织工价跌落，所得已不足解决口粮。支部就召开党员大会，研究如何能继续挣饭吃而又不耽误锄地，大家认为只有挤出男劳动力搞运输、打短工。但是经计算后，所有男劳力仅锄草还不够用。除动员妇女下坡锄地外别无办法。经讨论后当时妇女党员娄承菊便提出保证自己下坡，替出她的哥哥去搞副业。又经会后酝酿，王胜惠组青年妇女娄承桂、娄承馨等七人也组织起来，由有经验的老农带着下坡锄地。他们一天就挣了三十斤粮。这一成绩影响了洼子妇女也在村干部方桂英带头下组织了七人下坡，全村并很快就发展到十三个妇女参加变工。龙窝大部妇女起初强调有孩子没法下坡，看到该村方东玉等四人下坡后也都组织下坡。这样全行政村共有四十三个青壮妇女参加变工组。王胜德、杨成功两组妇女、儿童三天中即锄苗七十余亩。
