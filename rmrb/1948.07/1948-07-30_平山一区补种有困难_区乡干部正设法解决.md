Pingshan First District Faces Difficulties in Replanting
  District and Township Cadres Seek Solutions
    [Special Dispatch] Our correspondent reports: The first district of Pingshan County, being low-lying with crisscrossing canals, has suffered serious damage from three days of continuous heavy rain. The Yongle Village protective embankment was destroyed by mountain floods. According to preliminary reports, over a thousand mu of land have been flooded. Underground dwelling houses, pigsties, toilets, and weaving cellars have all collapsed. In Sizhuang and Mengbao, the water accumulation in the low-lying areas reaches several feet deep, flooding approximately three hundred mu of crops in the two villages. The seven villages along the Hutuo River in the district have been hit hardest. In Shuinian Village, out of more than 360 households, 874 rooms have collapsed, and 103 households have lost their homes. Over a thousand mu of seedlings have been flooded. According to incomplete statistics from fifteen villages in the district (out of a total of thirty-one), over 3,700 mu of crops have been damaged, including over 700 mu of washed-away beach and upland areas. 3,600 rooms have collapsed, and 370 households have lost their homes. According to experienced farmers, it is estimated that each mu of corn will yield at least six dou less grain (because very little sorghum is planted). Based on this calculation, the fifteen villages will suffer a reduction of around two thousand dan of grain. It is said that corn will die after being submerged in water for three days. If drainage ditches are quickly dug, it may be possible to salvage over a thousand dan of grain (half of which is already beyond saving). The masses in the flooded areas are anxious to drain the water, but struggle to dig ditches without leadership. Military dependents, families of revolutionary martyrs, and disaster victims who have lost their homes are constantly asking village cadres to solve their housing problems. Meanwhile, many upland areas should be quickly sown with buckwheat within two or three days after the rain. Therefore, a series of serious problems are facing the countryside, demanding immediate attention. The lack of buckwheat seeds has become a major issue in replanting. At the Pingshan City market on the 23rd, an old farmer selling buckwheat seeds said that there was only one portion of buckwheat seeds available, costing 200,000 yuan per dou. Many who came to buy buckwheat seeds found it too expensive and returned empty-handed. The village chief of Sizhuang searched for buckwheat for a long time in Lizhuang but couldn't find any, saying, "I would pay 300,000 yuan if there were buckwheat seeds." According to a report from Wangzi Village, the village needs three dan of buckwheat seeds, but can only provide one dan themselves. Mengling Village plans to plant buckwheat on over five qing of drought land needing replanting, requiring ten dan of seeds, but the masses cannot buy them regardless of the price. It is said that planting buckwheat will be too late in three or four days (from July 23rd). Therefore, the masses are very anxious. On the 23rd, the weather cleared up, and villages flocked to the district to ask for solutions and report the disaster situation. However, at this time, only Secretary Hao of the district office and Secretary Zhao of the county government, along with four or five other people, were at home, busy collecting the remaining public grain. Before and after the rain, until the 23rd, the county committee had not given any instructions and even sent a letter requesting that the few cadres remaining in the district be transferred to the county to hear the land reform summary report. Secretary Hao and other comrades then notified the village chiefs and township government chairmen to hold meetings, organize district and village cadres to fully lead the rescue of crops and the resettlement of disaster victims, temporarily suspend collection, and report the disaster situation to the county committee for instructions and request buckwheat seeds. However, due to the lack of prior preparation in the county, the reply was only: "The county does not have buckwheat seeds." "Let's think of a way now!" On the morning of July 24th, two members of the district committee returned from the county and immediately organized the existing ten or so cadres from the county, district, and township to go to the villages to lead disaster relief and production. At the village chief joint meeting, they divided into groups to study and arrange the following three urgent tasks: First, dig ditches to drain water. The landowners who benefit from the drainage will compensate the losers with grain. If necessary, the village military land will be used to compensate part of the land in the future. Those who still obstruct mobilization will be forced to comply. Every effort will be made to prevent the loss of a single mu of crops in the flooded areas by mobilizing all manpower to dig ditches and rescue them. Second, smash the entrances to underground tunnels (a major cause of house collapses). Mobilize the entire village to conduct thorough inspections and reinforce them to prevent further house collapses during future rains. Third, resettle disaster-stricken households, especially military dependents and families of revolutionary martyrs, and help them borrow houses to live in. On the morning of the 24th, the work teams went completely to the villages. The village chiefs came along for consultation and then left. On the same day, the East City Street mobilized the masses to smash the tunnel entrances. The water in Mengbao, Sizhuang, Mengling, and other villages receded by several inches or more, and the river water was receding. The reporter inspected Shengfo Village in the afternoon and saw Village Chief Wang Qiuqiu smashing his own tunnel entrance. When asked about the disaster relief situation in his village, he said that the township head came this morning to ask for some figures and then left. The village has not held a meeting to arrange what to do.

　　平山一区补种有困难
  　区乡干部正设法解决
    【本报特讯】总分社记者报导：平山县一区地势底凹，河渠交错，经三日连绵大雨，现已造成严重灾害。永乐村护村堤被山洪冲毁，据初步报告：淹地千余亩，有地道之房屋及猪圈、厕所、织布窖子，全部塌毁。泗庄、孟堡凹地积雨水深达数尺，两村淹庄稼约三百亩。该区沿滹沱河七个村庄受灾最重，水碾村三百六十多户，塌房八百七十四间，一百零三户失去住所，被水淹毁禾苗达千余亩。现据全区十五个村不完全的统计（全区共三十一个村），淹坏庄稼三千七百余亩，其中被冲毁的滩地、岗地即有七百余亩，房屋倒塌三千六百余间，丧失住所者达三百七十余户。据老农谈：估计毁一亩玉茭少打六大斗粮（因种高梁很少），如此计算，十五个村就要减产两千大石上下。据说玉茭在水里泡三天后就要死了。当前如很快挖沟泄水，则可能抢救一千多大石粮食（有一半已不能抢救）。被水淹地的群众着急泄水，苦于无人领导不易挖沟，无房住的军烈干属、灾民，不断找村干要求解决住处，同时雨后很多岗地两三天后即应赶紧播种荞麦。所以农村里摆着一连串的严重问题，急不可待。在补种中荞麦籽的缺乏成为一大问题，二十三日平山城集，据一买荞麦种老农谈，只有一份荞麦种，一斗要二十万元，不少买荞麦种的都嫌太贵，空袋而回。泗庄村长到里庄找了半天找不到荞麦，他说：“要有荞麦种三十万元我也要。”据王子村报告：该村需要三石荞麦种，本村只能解决一石，孟岭村补种缺苗旱地，准备种荞麦五顷多，需十石籽，群众贵贱买不到手，据说再过三四天（从七月二十三说）种荞麦就晚了。因此群众非常着急。二十三日天气初晴，各村纷纷找区里来要求想办法，报告灾情，可是区里这时只有区公所郝秘书及县政府赵秘书等四五个人在家，正忙于征收公粮尾欠。雨前雨后至二十三日县委尚无任何指示，并来信要将留在区里的几个干部也调到县去听土地改革总结报告，郝秘书等同志遂一面通知村长乡政府主席开会，组织区村干部全力领导抢救庄稼安置灾民，暂时停止征收，一面向县委报告灾情，请示办法，要求荞麦种。但由于县里事前毫无准备，仅答复：“荞麦种县里没有。”“现在想法吧！”七月二十四日上午区委从县里回来两人，立即组织了县、区、乡现有十余干部，下乡领导救灾生产，在村长联席会上，分片研究后布置下列三项紧急工作：一、挖沟泄水，占地由受益户赔他粮食损失，必要时以后由村中军田补给其一部土地，对动员仍阻碍者，强制执行，凡能泄出水的淹地争取不毁一亩庄稼，动员全体人力挖沟抢救。二、砸地道口（这是塌屋的一大原因），动员全村严密检查，砸结实以防再雨时倒房。三、安置灾户，尤其军烈干属，帮助他们借房子住。二十四日午前工作组即完全下乡，各村长随来研究好即随走，当日城东街已动员群众砸地道，孟堡、泗庄、孟岭等村水撤了数寸或尺余，河水已在降落。记者于下午到胜佛村巡视，见村长王秋秋正砸自己的地道口，问到他全村的救灾情况，他说今天早上乡长来要了几个数目字就走了，村里也没开会布置要怎样办。
