　　[North Yue News] In accordance with the special district's instructions to strengthen grain storage, the Fifth District of Hunyuan strictly inspected the work of the grain depots. Materials from eighteen villages show that the grain depots were quite chaotic. Many county, district, and village cadres illegally borrowed public grain for weddings and funerals, and the custodians also ate and used it casually. The village chief of Wu Village used 2,200 jin of public grain to marry his wife, and out of the eighty households in Shakeng who were responsible for safekeeping, seventy-one households consumed public grain. These eighteen villages illegally used 46,236 jin of millet, 28,822 jin of miscellaneous grains, 10,200 jin of grain straw, and 129,290 jin of yams from the public grain. The main reasons for this phenomenon are that the leadership did not pay enough attention to grain work, the financial and grain departments relaxed their leadership for a long time, did not conduct in-depth inspections, lacked systems, and failed to solve problems in a timely manner, which led to increasingly serious problems. The district has now stipulated the principle of "return what was used, return what is available" to recover the borrowed public grain. For villages with particularly serious problems, mass meetings are held to announce the facts of the errors, solicit opinions from the masses, and then send them to the district and county for handling according to law. After the rectification, the villages have returned 13,000 jin, and the rest will be returned within a set time limit.

　　浑源五区整顿粮库
    【北岳讯】浑源五区根据专区加强粮食保管的指示，严格检查粮库工作。有十八个村的材料说明：粮库相当混乱。不少县、区、村干部遇有婚丧喜事，非法借用公粮，保管户也有随便吃用现象。吴村村长娶老婆动用公粮二二○○斤，沙圪坑八十户代替保管的，有七十一户吃公粮。这十八个村非法动用公粮小米四六二三六斤，杂粮二八八二二斤，谷草一○二○○斤，山药一二九二九○斤。造成这种现象的原因，主要是由于领导上对粮食工作注意不够，财粮部门长期放松领导，不深入检查，没有制度，发现问题不能及时解决，以致问题越拖越严重。现该区已规定“用啥还啥，有啥还啥”的原则，收回借用的公粮。对问题特别严重的村庄，则召开群众大会，宣布错误事实，征求群众意见，然后送区县依法处理。经过整顿后，各村已补还一三○○○斤，其余一律限期还清。
