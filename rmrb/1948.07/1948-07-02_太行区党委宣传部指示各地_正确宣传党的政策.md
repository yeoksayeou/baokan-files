Taihang District Party Committee Propaganda Department Instructs All Localities to Correctly Publicize the Party's Policies

[Taihang News] The Propaganda Department of the Taihang District Party Committee issued instructions to the entire district on June 10 regarding propaganda work. It reviewed the "leftist" errors in the propaganda guidelines of the previous months and clearly put forward opinions on future propaganda work. It first pointed out that: In the Taihang District's implementation of the Land Law propaganda, the propaganda methods were creative, allowing the masses to understand the Party's policies and inspiring enthusiasm for production. However, due to underestimation of the foundation of land reform in the Taihang District (which was already quite thorough) and the organizational foundation (mainly impure work style), the propaganda content excessively emphasized shortcomings, one-sidedly emphasized the views of poor and hired peasants and absolute egalitarianism, causing some illusions among some Party members, cadres, and the masses, resulting in waste and a lack of enthusiasm for production. The instructions, on the one hand, pointed out from the perspective of guidelines and policies: This kind of one-sided, narrow poor peasant and absolute egalitarianism, reflecting the backward agricultural socialist ideology and the idea of excluding and attacking the old base, is a "leftist" deviation that violates the Party's policies and must be immediately corrected. On the other hand, it clearly stated that the Party's propaganda work in the future must correctly publicize and promote the implementation of the Party's policies. The instructions said: "Our control of propaganda work should mainly focus on the correctness of guidelines and policies. Only propaganda work that expresses correct guidelines and policies can powerfully promote organizational work and improve the consciousness of the masses." In order to ensure the correctness of guidelines and policies in future propaganda work, the instructions pointed out that all localities must carefully study the guidelines and policies of the higher-level instructions, and no one is allowed to be creative when it comes to propaganda related to guidelines and policies. All creations must be strictly reviewed in accordance with the review system in order to be correct and perfect. Regarding future propaganda work, the instructions put forward three specific suggestions: 1. Correct various specific policies: production policies, the policy of consolidating and uniting with the middle peasants, the policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, the rectification policy, the democratic construction policy, and the education policy; in the border areas, correct various specific policies for fighting the enemy; further promote the enthusiasm for production and the enthusiasm for fighting the enemy. 2. In order to promote the development of the large-scale production movement, the propaganda of the large-scale production movement must be launched immediately. The propaganda should emphasize that after feudalism has been eliminated, production should be developed and wealth should be created through labor; emphasize the combination of compensation for wrongly struggled middle peasants in the production movement, overcome the middle peasants' fear of struggle, fear of absolute equality, and unwillingness to develop, and establish the idea of building a family through labor and creating wealth through production; emphasize the voluntary, equivalent, and democratic organizational policies in production mutual aid organizations. In short, the Party's production policy should be clearly expressed in our propaganda work, the production enthusiasm of people of all strata should be improved, and the valuable experience of past production movements, especially the experience of labor heroes organizing production, should be promoted in order to quickly launch a large-scale production movement. 3. In terms of writing and creation, we should still create boldly in accordance with the Party's guidelines and policies, but all creations must be reviewed by the propaganda department of the county party committee and approved by the propaganda department of the district party committee.

　　太行区党委宣传部指示各地
    正确宣传党的政策
    【太行讯】太行区党委宣传部于六月十日向全区发出关于宣传工作的指示，对前几个月宣传方针上的左倾错误作了检查，明确提出对今后宣传工作的意见。首先指出：太行区在贯彻土地法宣传中，宣传方法上有创造，使群众了解党的政策，启发了生产积极性。但由于对太行区土改基础（已相当彻底）与组织基础（主要是作风不纯）估计不足，在宣传内容上过份强调了缺点，片面的强调了贫雇观点与绝对平均思想，引起部分党员干部群众一些错觉，因之浪费、不积极生产。该指示一方面从方针政策上指出：这种片面的狭隘的贫雇和绝对平均主义所反映的落后的农业社会主义思想及排斥与打击老基础思想是违反党的政策的左倾偏向，须立即加以纠正；一方面又明确的提出今后党的宣传工作必须是正确宣传与推动党的政策的贯彻。该指示说：“我们掌握宣传工作，主要应该着眼于方针与政策的正确。只有表现正确方针政策的宣传工作，才能有力的推动组织工作与提高群众觉悟”。为保证今后宣传工作中方针政策的端正，该指示指出各地以后必须很好研究上级指示的方针政策，凡有关方针政策的宣传，决不许自出心裁。一切创作，必须按照审查制度严格审查，以期正确完善。对今后宣传工作，该指示提出三点具体意见：一、端正各种具体政策：生产政策，巩固的联合中农政策，保护与发展工商业政策，整党政策，民主建设政策及教育政策；在边地，端正对敌斗争的各种具体政策；进一步发扬生产的积极性与对敌斗争的积极性。二、为推动开展大生产运动，必须立即展开大生产运动的宣传。宣传中应强调在封建已经消灭之后，应该发展生产，劳动致富；强调生产运动中结合补偿错斗中农，克服中农的“怕斗”、“怕绝对平”、不敢发展的思想，树立劳动发家、生产致富的思想；强调生产互助组织中的自愿、等价、民主的组织政策。总之，要从我们的宣传工作中明显地表现党的生产政策，提高各阶层人民的生产情绪，并发扬过去生产运动的宝贵经验，尤其是劳动英雄组织生产的经验，以迅速开展大规模的生产运动。三、在编写创作方面，仍应根据党的方针政策，大胆创造，但一切创作都必须经过县委宣传部审查，交地委宣传部批准。
