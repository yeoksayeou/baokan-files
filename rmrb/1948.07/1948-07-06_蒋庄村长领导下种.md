　　Jiangzhuang Village Chief Leads Planting
　　After a thorough rain on the 19th in Jiangzhuang, the fifth district of Zhuangping, village chief Jiang Longqiu immediately planned the planting. All the young and middle-aged men in the village had gone to dig the river and could not return immediately, which was a major difficulty. He first organized and planned the livestock and manpower, and then convened a mass meeting to explain the importance of a concentrated planting effort, as those digging the river could not return for the time being. They were digging the river for everyone's benefit, and we couldn't delay their land either. At this point, the masses began to discuss how to sow the land. Finally, everyone planned it out, matching manpower, animal power, and technical personnel together. Men and women, young and old, all went to the fields. The elderly shook the seed drills, and the children and women helped. Using a method of resting people and cattle but not resting the seed drills, the entire village completed planting in two days.

　　蒋庄村长领导下种
    庄平五区蒋庄十九日落透雨，村长蒋隆秋马上计划下种问题。全村的青壮年都挖河去了，马上又回不来，这是个大困难。他先把牲口、人力组织计划了一下，就召开群众大会，说明突击下种重要，挖河的一时不能回来，他们挖河是为了大家，咱们也不能把他们的地耽误了。这时群众都酝酿起来，讨论如何耩地如何下种。最后大家计划好了，把人力、畜力和技术人才搭配开来，男女老幼都下地，老年人摇耧，小孩妇女帮助，用歇人歇牛不歇耧的办法，两天全村都下种了。
