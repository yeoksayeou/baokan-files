[Taihang News] Lingdong Village in the first district of Huguan County, where cadres actively lead production, and Xiguanbi Village, where cadres lie down and do nothing, and let production run wild. As a result, the production work in these two villages showed two different situations, one good and one bad.

Lingdong Village has 581 mu of autumn land, with a total labor force of 54 and a half people, both men and women, young and old. Each mu requires 4 workdays, requiring a total of 2,324 workdays. If all the labor force is mobilized, it will take 40 days to complete the sowing. However, the cadres led the masses, using precise calculation methods, and after organizing, used 1,706 workdays to successfully complete the sowing by the Xiaoman solar term. They also selected five people to engage in small businesses such as collecting eggs, earning 220,000 yuan (Jicha, same below). Forty-two women weave nets, earning 640,000 yuan. The collectively organized spinning, weaving, coal pulling, and credit cooperative earned 218,000 yuan, for a combined total of 1,078,000 yuan. The whole village benefited from both agriculture and sideline occupations. The main reason is that they were organized and the cadres actively led. The agricultural association chairman—labor hero Zhao Quan—led the Cui Tangbao mutual aid team, implementing the principle of democratic and voluntary leadership. During the rectification, if the men were unwilling to combine with weaving, they were allowed to separate voluntarily. The team had 80 mu of autumn land, with no livestock, only five male laborers and seven female laborers, which was not enough. The masses voluntarily raised 118,000 yuan and bought two oxen, which plowed all the autumn land in the team and also helped other teams plow, earning 420 jin of rice. After deducting the cost of cattle feed, the remaining 200 jin of rice were distributed as dividends according to shares. The shareholders benefited, and the whole team also solved the problem of livestock power. Everyone was very happy.

The cadres of Xiguanbi misunderstood the spirit of the democratic party rectification policy, lay down and did nothing, and did not lead production at all. They also said: "If they don't help each other, the masses are very energetic, and sideline production can make a lot of money." The cadres do not work, waiting to "pass the test" in the future. The village's production runs wild. As a result, both agriculture and sideline occupations were not done well. When they were engaged in agriculture, everyone scrambled to sell red soil, so that the land was not sown well. Selling red soil is very profitable, but because it was not organized, they went to sell it separately. Everyone was afraid of not being able to sell it, and they topped each other, making the red soil worthless, and both agriculture and sideline occupations suffered.

　　岭东村干积极领导
    农副业都获利
    西关壁干部躺倒不干
    群众生产自流
    【太行讯】壶关一区岭东村干积极领导生产，西关壁村干躺倒了，对生产放任自流，结果这两个村的生产工作，出现了好坏不同的两种情况。
    岭东全村秋地五百八十一亩，男女老少折合劳力五十四个半，每亩按四算个工，需工两千三百二十四个，劳力全部出动，得四十天才能下完种。但干部领导群众，用精确计算的方法，经过组织起来，用一千七百零六个工，于小满节即全部胜利完成下种。还抽出五人搞收鸡蛋等小买卖，赚二十二万元（冀钞，下同）。四十二个妇女织网子，洋六十四万元，群众合组的纺织拉煤信用社赚二十一万八千元，三综合起来共一百零七万八千元。全村得到农副业双重利，主要原因就是组织起来，干部积极领导。农会主席—劳动英雄赵全则领导下的崔堂保互助组，实行了民主自愿的领导原则，在整顿中男人不愿和纺织结合，就让大家自愿分开。全组八十亩秋地，没有一个牲口，只有男劳力五个，女劳力七个，不够使用。群众自愿凑了十一万八千元，买了两个牛，把本组所有秋地耕完，还帮助别组耕地，赚米四百二十斤。除牛草料开支外，余米二百斤，按股分了红。入股人得到了利，全组也解决了畜力困难，大家都很高兴。
    西关壁干部误解民主整党政策的精神，躺倒不干，对生产根本没领导，还说：“不互助群众很有劲，副业生产很能赚钱。”干部不工作，等待将来“过关”，村里生产自流，结果农副业都没搞好。正搞农业时大家抢着卖红土，弄得没有种好地。卖红土虽很赚钱，但是由于没有组织起来，散着去卖，谁也怕卖不了，互相顶，弄得红土不值钱，农副业都吃了亏。　（良玉、瑞锦、金和、进水）
