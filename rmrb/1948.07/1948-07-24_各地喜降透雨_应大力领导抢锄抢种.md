　　【Special Dispatch from This Newspaper】On the 18th, 19th, and 23rd, various regions welcomed the first heavy rain since the summer, which continued until the 21st. Prior to this, rain had fallen successively in all areas of central Hebei, many counties in the Taihang and Taiyue regions, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, and areas such as Fuping in the North Yue region. However, a large portion of the entire region suffered from drought or had not received sufficient rain. This heavy rain raises hopes for the autumn harvest, and farmers are visibly delighted. In many areas, farmers are rushing to plant sweet potato seedlings in the rain, eagerly forming teams to inspect the crops in the rain, and preparing to rush to hoe. Party and government leading organs in various regions, without prior consultation, immediately inquired about the rainfall in various areas on the same day, calling on leading organs at all levels to immediately organize the masses to rush to hoe, replant, and diligently investigate the difficulties and demands of the people after the rain. It is reported that many regions, due to the severity of the drought, had prepared early on, with preparations such as seeds and labor mutual aid already in place, waiting for the good rain to fall before taking action. However, some Party and government organs have abandoned production leadership, and the preparations for replanting after the rain were not sufficiently made in advance. Currently, in areas where planting has not yet been completed (in the first district of Nanle, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, unplanted land accounts for 70% of the entire area), adjusting seed supplies has become a major problem. For example, some people want to plant buckwheat, but there is nowhere to buy seeds. Some areas have suffered successive years of poor harvests and are unable to replant. In the severely drought-stricken areas of the entire ninth district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and parts of the sixth and eighth districts, most of the autumn seedlings have died from drought. In Shanghe County alone, autumn seedlings killed by drought account for 30% of the entire county. Replanting has become the most urgent requirement. Furthermore, in many areas, due to excessive troop deployments and heavy corvee labor, there is insufficient manpower to rush to plant. This is most severe in the counties along the Yellow River. All of these require strong government support to specifically solve the difficulties. In areas where planting has already been completed, once the weather clears and the ground dries, efforts should be made to rush to hoe. The Party and government should provide planned leadership, such as adjusting labor, setting wages, providing substitute cultivation for military dependents, arranging land for migrant workers engaged in war service, and appropriately resolving the difficulties of households without labor. All of these should be reasonably resolved during the weeding campaign. In any region, it is necessary to combine this production with a large-scale ideological mobilization for production among all classes, eliminating the pessimistic sentiments that have grown due to the drought (such as the belief that "even if it rains, the harvest will not be good"), and encouraging everyone to actively struggle for a better harvest year.

　　各地喜降透雨
  　应大力领导抢锄抢种
    【本报特讯】十八、十九、二十三日各地喜降入夏以来的第一次大雨，至二十一日未停。在这以前，曾先后落雨者有冀中全部地区，太行太岳不少县份，冀鲁豫河南地区，以及北岳阜平等地，但全区有很大一部分地区苦旱或未落透雨，这次大雨，秋收有望，农民喜形于色，许多地区农民雨中赶插红薯秧，争相结队，冒雨看望田禾，准备抢锄。各地党政领导机关，均不约而同的于当日急询各地雨情，号召各级领导机关，立即组织群众在雨后抢锄，补种，抢锄，以及认真调查人民的困难和要求。据息：不少地区由于旱灾严重，党政领导机关，早有准备，诸如种子、劳力互助等已经准备好，只待好雨一降，就一齐动手，但也有些党和政府放弃生产领导，雨后抢种的准备工作事先均做得不够充分。目前在未种上的地方（冀鲁豫南乐一区未种土地占全区百分之七十），调剂种子已成一个很大的问题，如有人要求种荞麦，但种子没处去买；有的地方连遭歉年已无力补种；冀鲁豫九分区全部和六、八分区各一部旱灾严重地区，秋苗大部旱死，只尚和县全县旱死秋苗竟占百分之三十。补种成为最急切的要求。还有不少地区由于出兵过多及支差繁忙，人力不足用，抢种不过来。这以沿黄河各县最为严重。这些均需要政府大力扶助，具体解决困难。在已种上的地区，天晴地干就要全力抢锄，党和政府应有计划的领导，譬如劳力的调剂，工资的制定，军干属的代耕，在外担负战勤的民工土地的安排，无劳力户困难的适当解决……均要在锄苗运动中得到合理解决。无论在任何地区，都需要结合这次生产向各阶层进行大生产的思想动员，扫除曾因天旱而滋长的悲观情绪（譬如以为“下了雨也收不好”等说法），鼓励大家积极斗争，争取一个较好年成。
