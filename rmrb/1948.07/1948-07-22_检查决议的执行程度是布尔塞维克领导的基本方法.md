　　Checking the Implementation of Resolutions is a Basic Method of Bolshevik Leadership
    *Pravda* Editorial
  　It is common knowledge that a correct policy is the source of victory. However, this does not equal victory itself. Victory does not come on its own; it must be organized and fought for.
    Comrade Stalin gave a classic definition of the relationship between policy lines and organizational work. He said: "After a correct line has been formulated, and a correct resolution has been made on the problem, the success or failure of the matter depends on the organizational work, the correct selection of personnel, and the inspection of the degree of implementation by various leading organs. Otherwise, the party's correct line and resolutions will suffer serious damage. Not only that, after a correct policy line has been formulated, organizational work will determine everything, even the fate of the policy line itself—success or failure."
    The reason why Bolshevik policies can achieve continuous victories is that the party constantly uses all its strength to carry out organizational work to ensure the realization of its policy line. Our party is carrying out arduous work—mobilizing the broad masses of people to complete the historical task of communist construction.
    Lenin and Stalin taught us: The most important thing in organizational work is to select cadres and check on implementation. As long as the party organization follows this instruction, it can make Bolshevik leadership methods gain benefits in all aspects of our great construction.
    The current party representative meetings point out that in order to improve the economy and culture in the post-war period, the party organization is carrying out enthusiastic and comprehensive work, giving play to the great strength of the Soviet people, their enthusiasm, and their firm spirit in overcoming difficulties. The party organization initiated a socialist competition among the people to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. After the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on literature and art issues was promulgated, organizations in various places paid more attention to ideological education work. Many party organizations have accumulated rich experience in mass propaganda and mobilization. Party cadres firmly grasp the art of Bolshevik leadership and improve their ideological and theoretical level.
    However, many representative meetings also pointed out the serious shortcomings in the leadership methods of party organizations. There are still such staff who only pay attention to meetings, preparing resolutions, and making resolutions. After the resolution is made, they often forget these resolutions completely. What will happen to the made resolutions in practice, to what extent can they be realized, whether all agencies have taken action, what difficulties have been encountered; what supplementary measures need to be taken to ensure the smooth progress of the matter—not enough attention is paid to all of these. For example, the party representative meeting of the Chkalov Oblast pointed out that the Oblast Party Committee and some District Party Committees weakened the inspection of the implementation of their resolutions. The Oblast Party Committee and the District Party Committee relied only on the activities of their small groups for the implementation of resolutions, and failed to mobilize party cadres and Soviet cadres and the broad masses of workers to actively participate in the work. The method of dispatching plenipotentiaries in desperation has become the main means of leadership here. Daily meticulous mass work and guidance to cadres are often replaced by the transmission of countless resolutions and the sending of telegrams.
    Such a leadership method can create an illusion, that is: If the Party Committee can make a large number of resolutions and send many telegrams to various places, it seems to indicate that it is indeed working hard enough. But in fact, it is precisely because the party organs are busy with these tasks that they cannot widely and comprehensively promote the progress of things. In this way, it is not possible to give full play to the existing possibilities for improving all work.
    The Bolshevik leadership principle requires that after a resolution is made, a plan and strategy must be made to ensure the implementation of this resolution. In one case, it is necessary to send one or a group of experienced staff to the site. In another case, it is necessary to give assistance in materials, technology, and equipment. In short, organizing the implementation of resolutions means mobilizing countless cadres of the Party and the Soviets to work actively, leading the broad masses of people to overcome difficulties, and ensuring the completion of the country's current tasks at the Bolshevik work speed. Working with cadres, giving them practical help, and guiding them are the main aspects of inspection. The responsibility of the Party Committee is to make the staff understand the essence of the tasks they are performing, to make them understand how they can better implement the resolutions, and what organizational form is best to increase the Party's power to mobilize the masses and ensure the resolution of the current tasks of the Party organization.
    Checking the implementation is the most effective weapon of the party organization. However, the following points must be strictly observed:
    First, the inspection of the degree of implementation must be systematic, not episodic. That is to say, after the resolution is made, immediately urge the implementation of the resolution without hesitation or waiting. The Party Committee must understand the daily life of the organization. Only in this way can it intervene at any time and correct the work when necessary. In this way, the inspection of the degree of implementation can discover the chaos in a certain paragraph of the work at any time and find out the person responsible for the chaos in time. Only by inspecting the degree of implementation at any time and systematically can errors and shortcomings be prevented, and only in this way can the Party Committee help its local organizations in a timely manner. Checking the implementation is a powerful weapon for party organizations to educate cadres with Bolshevik responsibility and discipline.
    Second, the inspection of the degree of implementation should not be the responsibility of minor staff, but should be done by the leaders themselves. Lenin demanded that the leaders of all organizations and agencies must "control in their own hands" experienced and capable staff under their leadership "to check the progress of actual work" and entrust "someone to go there, inspect, check, and hold you responsible if something goes wrong." Comrade Stalin once instructed: The leader's personal inspection of the work is one of the most important conditions that can make the work inspection effective.
    Third, the inspection of the degree of implementation should not be based solely on formal reports, but should first be inspected at the workplace based on the actual results of the work.
    Fourth, the inspection of the degree of implementation must be objective and strict. Only by unfolding Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism can shortcomings be exposed in time and methods for correcting shortcomings be formulated. There must be no fraud or favoritism in solving all problems when inspecting the degree of implementation. Where this non-Bolshevik atmosphere develops, irresponsibility will arise, followed by indifference and disloyalty to the interests of the country. Covering up shortcomings should not be done, sharp Bolshevik criticism should be unfolded, and a very strict attitude should be taken towards it, not tolerance—this is an important condition for making the inspection of the degree of implementation effective.
    Checking the implementation is a basic method of Bolshevik leadership. The results of checking the implementation can reflect the Party Committee's entire leadership style and its ability to organize Party activists, all Party members, and the broad masses of workers to participate in the work. If we want to strengthen the supervision and inspection of work, we must improve all leadership methods.
    Comrade Stalin taught us: "If the inspection of work can be well organized, it will be like a searchlight, illuminating the work of a department at any time and anywhere, exposing the bureaucrats and formalists to their original form. It can be said with certainty that nine-tenths of the defects and loopholes in our work are due to the lack of well-organized work inspection. There is no doubt that if there is a correct work inspection, most of the defects and loopholes in the work can be avoided."
    The responsibility of the party organization is to actively improve the inspection of the implementation of resolutions. And the resolutions themselves should indeed meet the requirements of the great tasks undertaken by the Soviet people. This is the premise for new victories in all aspects of our economic, cultural life, and the construction of the communist cause.

### 检查决议的执行程度是布尔塞维克领导的基本方法

　　检查决议的执行程度是布尔塞维克领导的基本方法
    苏联真理报社论
  　正确的政策是胜利的源泉，这是人所共知的。但是，这并不等于胜利的本身。胜利不是自己会来到的，必须加以组织，加以争取。
    斯大林同志对于政策路线与组织工作的相互关系，作出了典型的定义。他说：“在制定正确的路线之后，对问题已作出正确的决议之后，事情的成败即决定于组织工作、人员的正确选择以及对各个领导机关执行程度的检查。否则，党的正确路线与决议即会遭受严重的损害。不仅如此，在制定正确的政策路线之后，组织工作即将决定一切，就是政策路线本身的命运——成功或失败——亦不例外。”
    布尔塞维克政策之所以能获得连续的胜利，是因为党经常以全部力量进行组织工作，以保证自己政策路线之实现。我们的党正在进行着艰巨的工作——动员广大人民群众完成共产主义建设的历史任务。
    列宁与斯大林教导我们：在组织工作中最主要的是选择干部与检查执行程度。党的组织只要遵循这一指示，就可以使布尔塞维克的领导方法在我国伟大建设的各方面都获得进益。
    目前所进行的党的代表会议指出：党的组织为了提高战后时期的经济与文化，正在进行着热烈的与全面的工作，发挥苏维埃人民的伟大力量，他们的积极性与克服困难的坚定精神。党的组织在全国人民中发起社会主义竞赛，争取五年计划在四年内完成。在联共党中央对文学与艺术问题的决议颁布后，各地组织即更加注意于思想教育工作。许多党组织都积累了对群众宣传鼓动的丰富的经验。党的干部强固的掌握着布尔塞维克的领导艺术，提高自己的思想理论水平。
    但是，许多次的代表会议也指出了党组织在领导工作方法上存在的严重的缺点。仍然有这样的工作人员，他们只注意于开会，准备决议与制成决议。而在决议一经制成之后，他们往往就会把这些决议忘得一干二净。制成的决议在实践中会怎样，所能实现的程度如何，是否所有的机构都已行动起来，遇到何种困难；需要采取何种补充措施以保证事情的顺利进行——对于所有这些都不给以应有的注意。例如，乞卡洛夫州的党代表会议指出：州党委与某些区党委减弱了对自己决议的执行程度的检查。州党委与区党委对于决议的执行只倚靠着自己小团体的活动，未能发动党的干部与苏维埃干部以及广大劳动群众积极参加工作。在万不得已时方派遣全权代表的办法，在这里已成为领导上的主要手段。日常的细密的群众工作、对干部的指导等时常是被无数决议的传达与电报的拍发取而代之。
    这样的领导方法会造成一种错觉，即是：党委会如能制成大量的决议，向各地发出许多电报，就似乎能表明它在工作中确实有足够的紧张。但实际上，党的机关正是因为忙于这些工作而使自己不能广泛并全面的推动事情的进程。这样，也就不能充分发挥现有的提高全部工作的可能性。
    布尔塞维克的领导原则要求：在制成决议之后即须计划并制定方策以保证这一决议的执行。在一种情形下，需要派出一个或一组有经验的工作人员至现地去。在另种情形下，则必须给以物资技术器材的援助。总而言之，组织决议的执行，这就是说要发动党与苏维埃的无数干部积极工作，由他们领导广大人民克服困难，保证以布尔塞维克的工作速度完成国家当前的任务。与干部们一起工作，给他们实际的帮助，指导他们，这是检查的主要方面。党委会的责任在于使工作人员们明白他们所执行的任务的实质，使他们了解用何种方法可以更好的执行决议，最好是选择何种组织形式方能增加党发动群众的力量，保证党组织当前任务的解决。
    检查执行程度是党组织手段中最有效的武器。但必须严格遵守下述数点：
    第一、对执行程度的检查必须是有系统的，而不是插曲式的。就是说，在制成决议之后，不迟疑，不等待，立即督促决议的执行。党委会必须了解该组织的日常生活，惟有如此，它才能随时随地过问并在必要时纠正工作。这样，对执行程度的检查方能随时发现工作中某一段落的混乱并及时找出造成混乱的责任者。只有随时并有系统的检查执行程度，方能预防错误和缺点，也只有如此，党委会方能适时的帮助自己的地方组织。检查执行程度乃是党组织以布尔塞维克责任心与纪律性教育干部的有力武器。
    第二、检查执行程度不应该由次要的工作人员负责，而应该由领导人亲自动手。列宁曾要求各组织，各机关的领导人必须将自己领导下的有经验的，得力的工作人员“控制在自己手内，用以检查实际工作之进行”，委托“某某人，到那里去，视察，检查，如果事情出漏洞就要你负责”。斯大林同志曾指示过：领导人亲自检查工作是能够使工作检查发生效力的最重要条件之一。
    第三、检查执行程度应该不只是根据形式的报告，而首先应在工作地点，根据工作的实际效果检查之。
    第四、检查执行程度必须是客观的，严格的。惟有展开布尔塞维克的批评与自我批评方能及时揭露缺点并制定纠正缺点的方法。检查执行程度时对一切问题的解决不能舞弊徇私。哪里发展这种非布尔塞维克的风气，哪里就会产生不负责任的情形，跟踪而来的就是对国家利益的漠不关心与不忠实。对着缺点应该不是掩饰，要展开尖锐的布尔塞维克的批评，不是宽容，要用非常严格的态度对待它——这是使检查执行程度收效的一个重要条件。
    检查执行程度是布尔塞维克领导的基本方法。检查执行程度的结果可以反映出党委会的全部领导作风，组织党的积极分子、全体共产党员、广大劳动群众参加工作的能力。如果要加强对工作的督促与检查，就必须改进全部的领导工作方法。
    斯大林同志教导我们：“工作的检查如能组织良好，就会象探照灯似的，随时随地照明一个部门的工作情况，使官僚主义者与事务主义者暴露自己的原形。可以肯定的说：我们工作中十分之九的缺陷与漏洞都是由于缺乏组织良好的工作检查而来。无疑问的，如果有正确的工作检查，工作中的缺陷和漏洞大都可以避免的。”
    党组织的责任是对于决议执行程度的检查工作加以积极的改进。而决议的本身则应确实符合苏维埃人民为执行其所担负的伟大任务的要求。这就是我国经济、文化生活与共产主义事业建设各方面的新的胜利的前提。（常彦卿译自一九四八年四月十七日苏联真理报）
