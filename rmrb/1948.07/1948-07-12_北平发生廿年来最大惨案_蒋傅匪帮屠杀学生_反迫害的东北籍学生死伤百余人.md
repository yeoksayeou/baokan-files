Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Combined foreign news agency reports: The Chiang and Fu gangs in Beiping are frantically massacring Northeast students in Beiping who are protesting persecution and hunger. Over a hundred students have been killed and wounded, and thirty-seven have been arrested, creating the biggest massacre of students in Beiping in over twenty years since the "March 18th" incident in 1926 when the Northern Warlords massacred students.

Under the threats and deception of the Chiang government, students who arrived in Beiping from the Shenyang area of the Northeast Chiang-controlled area were completely ignored by the Chiang government in terms of their lives and studies. "Without clothes, food, housing, or books to read" (according to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao). They were already filled with indignation towards the Chiang government. In addition, the Chiang-controlled Municipal Council unexpectedly passed a proposal to concentrate them for military training and "stipulate the conscription of all Northeast students into the army" (according to a United Press dispatch from Beiping on the 6th), preparing to drive them to serve as cannon fodder for the Four Families' anti-people civil war, and "expel them from the Municipal Council Hall where they were temporarily residing" (according to the same source). This aroused even greater anger among the Northeast students. On the morning of the 5th of this month, several thousand students (the Associated Press reported 5,000, and the United Press reported 3,000 to 4,000) from nine universities and one middle school in the Northeast marched to the Municipal Council to protest this absurd resolution. That afternoon, students gathered at the residence of Xu Huidong, the speaker of the Municipal Council, in Dongjiaomin Lane, demanding that Xu cancel the proposal to persecute students. The Chiang bandit military police were on high alert, deployed around Xu's residence, not allowing students to approach, and attacked students with stones, but the students remained unmoved. They persisted until evening, when the police authorities pretended to allow the matter to be handled the next day. As the students began to disperse and return home, the Chiang bandit garrison commander suddenly ordered the police, military police, and troops to open fire on the unarmed students, and a massacre of inhumane proportions began. According to a United Press reporter in Beiping, "As the shooting suddenly and unexpectedly began, the reporter was standing at the forefront of a group of students. A boy next to me was shot in the abdomen and bled to death. Three students next to him were also injured and fell on the sidewalk." "Students were crawling on the ground, and some students in the east began to run wildly. The reporter clearly saw the soldiers loading bullets and shooting at the fleeing students at the speed of fire." According to statistics released by the Northeast Student Federation cited by the Associated Press in Beiping on the 8th, over a hundred students were killed and wounded, including thirteen who were killed on the spot and died in the hospital after being seriously injured, and eighteen others were in critical condition. A total of one hundred people were injured, and thirty-seven were arrested. Another ten-year-old bystander was also shot dead.

After committing this atrocity, the Chiang Kai-shek gang hastily buried the bodies of the murdered students, attempting to destroy the evidence, and locked the Northeast students in the various dilapidated temples where they were temporarily residing, depriving them of their freedom of movement and contact with the outside world. From the 6th, a city-wide curfew was declared, and the Chiang bandit Central News Agency, with blood in its mouth, slandered the unarmed students as "rioters," claiming that the students fired first, and fabricated that "military police casualties numbered over twenty, 'rioters' died three and were injured over ten" (Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th). But shameless lies cannot cover up the facts of blood. The Associated Press dispatches on the 6th and 7th pointed out: "According to the reporter's investigation in shops, restaurants, and other places, people from all walks of life believe that the official Central News Agency's report on this incident is completely distorted." "After careful inquiry, six foreigners who witnessed the shooting said that none of them had seen any students firing a gun, or any military police casualties due to so-called student shootings." One witness said: "The records in the local newspapers (referring to 'officially approved Central News Agency news') are all lies." Another United Press report on the 7th reported: "The official Central News Agency reported only three student deaths, but Chinese reporters, a French reporter, and I saw five corpses last night, and the authorities had verified that these corpses were all students who had been beaten to death." The ugly and shamelessness of the rumor factory, Central News Agency, has once again been exposed before the people of the world.

	Widespread Student Anger and Support; Demand Immediate Execution of Murderers
	Eight Universities Establish "July 5th Incident" Support Association

This crime of the Chiang and Fu gangs' brutal massacre of Northeast students is arousing the indignation of students everywhere. According to Associated Press reports from Beiping on the 7th and 8th: Students from eight universities in Beiping, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Beijing Normal University, Chaoyang College, Railway Management College, North China College, and Sino-French University, have established the "Beiping Eight Universities July 5th Incident Support Association." Each of the eight universities sent one representative to form an eight-person committee to write to the Chiang government authorities, condemning this crime, and put forward solemn demands, including the immediate release of the arrested students, the execution of the murderers, and compensation for the funeral expenses, support funds, and medical expenses of the dead and injured students. The association has also sent letters to the World Student Association, calling for the righteous support of students from all countries, and issued a "Letter to Compatriots Across the Country," which specifically pointed out that the killed students were killed with "American-made bullets." According to a United Press dispatch from Beiping on the 7th: "Observers generally expect that this shooting will cause a series of reactions from other student groups here."

　　北平发生廿年来最大惨案
    蒋傅匪帮屠杀学生
    反迫害的东北籍学生死伤百余人
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合外国通讯社消息：北平蒋、傅匪帮疯狂屠杀反迫害、反饥饿的东北来平学生，学生死伤一百余人，被逮捕三十七人，造成自一九二六年北洋军阀屠杀学生的“三一八”事件之后二十余年来北平最大一次屠杀学生的惨案。
    在蒋政府威胁与欺骗下，由东北蒋管区沈阳一带抵达北平的学生，因蒋政府对他们的生活学业根本不管，“无衣无食，无处住，更无书读”（津大公报语）。他们对蒋政府本已满胸愤慨，再加上蒋记市参议会竟通过将他们集中军训、“规定征召全部东北学生当兵”的议案（据合众社北平六日电），准备驱迫他们充当四大家族反人民内战的炮灰，并“将他们从借住的参议会大厅驱逐外出”（据同上），这就引起了东北籍学生更大的愤怒。本月五日晨，东北九个大学及一个中学学生数千人（美联社报导为五千人，合众社报导为三、四千人），列队前往市参议会，抗议此一荒谬决议。当日下午，学生群集东交民巷该市参议会议长许惠东住宅，要求许将迫害学生的议案取消，蒋匪军警如临大敌，在许宅附近布岗，不许学生近前，并以石子袭击学生，但学生不为所动。坚持至傍晚，警察当局佯为允许明日再作处理，当学生开始散队回家时，蒋匪警备司令突命令警察、宪兵及军队向赤手空拳的学生开枪，一场灭绝人性的大屠杀即告开始。据合众社驻北平记者报导称：“当射击意外地突然开始时，记者正站在一群学生的前列，我身边的一个男孩子腹部中弹冒血毙命，他旁边的三个学生也受伤倒在人行道上”，“学生匍匐在地上，东面有一些学生开始狂奔，记者很清楚地看见士兵以上好子弹就开枪的速度，追着射击逃跑的学生”。据美联社北平八日电引据东北学联发表统计，学生死伤一百余人，其中当场被击毙和重伤入医院后毙命者十三人，且尚有十八人生命危险，受伤者共达一百人，被捕者三十七名，另一仅十岁的旁观小孩亦被击毙。
    蒋介石匪帮制造此一惨案后，竟草草将死难学生尸首埋葬，妄图毁灭罪证，并将东北学生关闭在他们临时栖宿的各破庙中，剥夺其行动及与外界接触的自由。复自六日起宣布全市戒严，而蒋匪中央社则含血喷人，诬蔑赤手空拳的学生为“暴徒”，谓学生首先开枪射击，又无中生有谓“计军警死伤二十余人，‘暴徒’死三人，受伤十余人”（中央社北平五日电）。但无耻的谎言掩盖不了血的事实，美联社六、七两日电指出：“据记者赴商店、饭店及其他地方调查，各行各业的人都认为官方中央社关于这一事件的报导全部都是歪曲事实。”“记者缜密询问六位目击枪杀事件的外国人，没有一个人曾看见任何学生开枪，或由于所谓学生开枪而使军警有任何伤亡。”一位目击者称：“此间报上的记载（指‘官方批准的中央社消息’）全是谎话一篇。”另据合众社七日电报导：“官方的中央社报导仅死学生三人，但中国记者，一法国记者及我，昨晚曾看到五个尸首，而当局曾验出这些尸首全部是被打死的学生。”谣言工厂中央社的丑恶无耻又一次在全世界人民面前暴露。
    　　　　广大学生愤慨声援　要求立即枪决凶手
    　　八大学成立“七五事件”后援会
    蒋傅匪帮此一残酷屠杀东北学生的罪行，正激起各地广大学生的愤慨。据美联社北平七、八日电报导：平市北大、清华、燕京、北平师范学院、朝阳学院、铁道管理学院、华北学院及中法大学等八个大学的学生，已成立“北平八大学七五事件后援会”，八大学各派代表一人组成八人委员会致函蒋政府当局，谴责此一罪行，并提出立即释放被捕学生，枪决凶手，赔偿死伤学生葬殓费，扶衅费及医药费等严正要求。该会并已致函世界学联，呼吁各国学生的正义声援，另发表“告全国同胞书”，书中特别指出，被杀死的学生是用“美制子弹”杀死的。据合众社北平七日电指出：“观察家大都预料这次射击将会引起此间其他学生团体一连串的反应。”
