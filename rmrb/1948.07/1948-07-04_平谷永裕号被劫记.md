When the Chiang bandits occupied the empty city of Pinggu, everyone except a very few “big bellies” ran away. Zhang Zizhen, the owner of the Yongyu general merchandise store in Xiguan South Street, thought to himself, "We are all Chinese, whoever comes will collect taxes and levies." He did not run.

After a burst of rapid footsteps, the sound of banging and smashing doors echoed throughout the streets and alleys, mixed with shouts and curses.

The door of Yongyu Store was opened, and a group of bandit soldiers poured in, angrily shouting, "This is a shop of the Eighth Route Army!" The owner quickly explained, "Gentlemen, this is a private business." "What? There is no private store in Pinggu city." The owner pleaded, "It is indeed my private business, I dare not lie to the 'National Army'." A bandit soldier pulled the bolt of his rifle, chambered a round, and pointed it at his heart, cursing, "You still quibble, want to eat a bullet!" The owner was so frightened that he had to retreat silently to the side. So, the Chiang bandit soldiers grabbed the noodles, dried vermicelli, and peanut oil from his shelves. More and more bandit soldiers came, and Yongyu Store had less and less goods, but what made the owner most sad was the jar of more than two hundred *jin* of soy sauce, the two jars of more than five hundred *jin* of vinegar, and half a jar of wine. The wine was drunk up by the bandit soldiers, and the two jars of vinegar mash were poured all over the house and courtyard.

Then, the Chiang bandit soldiers wanted to repair the city walls, build bunkers, and dig moats, and they demolished his house and many other people's houses. This made Zhang Zizhen anxious, but he had not fully understood the Chiang bandit soldiers, and thought, "If the soldiers are so bad, the officers can't ignore it, every army should have some law." He went into the city to file a complaint. He went to the political department of the bandit army, but no one paid attention to him. Later, he went to the military law office, and a fat adjutant came out to accept his complaint. Zhang, the shopkeeper, complained bitterly to him, "Everything has been taken away, now I can only go begging with a casserole." Who knew that the fat adjutant impatiently replied cunningly, "In times of war, 'misunderstandings' are inevitable. Judging from what you said, the losses are not small, how about compensating you with five hundred *jin* of millet?" The owner, looking at his fierce appearance, was so frightened that he kept saying, "No compensation is needed, no compensation is needed." The fat adjutant stared and asked, "Is it because you think it's too little?" The owner said, "It's not that I think it's too little, I dare not accept it." "'National Army' is reasonable, that's it, here's five hundred *jin* of millet for you, go back." With that, he left. But where was the millet? Where to get it? The owner woke up and realized that what he said was just empty words. Openly robbing the common people, this is the "law" of the Chiang bandit army. He went home, full of resentment.

The People's Liberation Army has returned. The day after the Chiang bandit soldiers abandoned the city and fled, Zhang, the shopkeeper, looked blankly at the empty shelves, the overturned vinegar jars, and some piles of rubble that had been demolished, recalling the scene of the increasingly prosperous business since the People's Liberation Army liberated Pinggu from the hands of the Chiang bandits last year—for example, in the past, if he sold five jars of vinegar, then he could sell ten jars. This gradually rising life was suddenly ruined by the Chiang bandit soldiers. Thinking of this, Zhang, the shopkeeper, suddenly realized that the People's Liberation Army is truly the army of the people, and the Chiang bandits are the army that betray the country and harm the people.

　　平谷永裕号被劫记
    当蒋匪进占平谷空城的时候，除了极少数“大肚皮”外，人们都跑出去了。西关南大街永裕号小杂贷铺掌柜张子珍心里想：“大家都是中国人，谁来也是上税纳捐。”他没有跑。
    一阵急促的脚步声之后，满街满巷都响起了打门和砸门声，还夹杂着叫嚣臭骂声。
    永裕号门被打开了，涌进来一群匪军，恶狠狠的乱嚷：“是八路的商店”。掌柜的连忙解释道：“先生，是私人商家”。“什么？平谷城没有一家私人商店”。掌柜的哀求道：“确实是我私人开的，我不敢对‘国军’说假话”。一个匪军一拉枪拴，顶上子弹，顶住他的心窝，骂道：“你还狡赖，想吃枪子！”掌柜吓的只好默默的退到一边去了。于是，蒋匪军将他货架上的挂面、干粉、花生油，大抢特抢。匪军越来越多，永裕号的货越拿越少，但最使掌柜伤心的，是二百多斤的一缸酱，五百多斤的两缸醋，还有半缸酒。酒被匪军喝光，两缸没下曲的醋花被泼了满屋满院。
    接着，蒋匪军要补城墙，修碉堡，挖护城壕，把他的屋子和很多人的屋子都拆了，这一下张子珍着了急，但他对蒋匪军还未完全认识清楚，心想：“当弟兄的这样糟，当官的不能不管，什么军队也该有个王法”。他进城去，想去告状。他到了匪军的政治部，但没有人理他。后来又到了军法处，出来接受他控诉的是一个胖副官。张掌柜的向他痛诉：“什么都被拿光了，现在我只有提着砂锅去要饭了。”谁知那胖副官很不耐烦的狡猾的回答道：“战乱时期，发生‘误会’是免不了的。听你说来损失很不少，赔你五百斤小米怎么样？”掌柜的看着他那副凶样子，吓的连说：“不用赔了，不用赔了。”胖副官瞪着眼问道：“是嫌少吗？”掌柜说：“不是嫌少，小的不敢要。”“有什么不敢？‘国军’是讲道理的，就这样，给你五百斤小米，你回去吧。”说着他就扬长而去。但是米呢？向那里去取？掌柜的清醒过来，晓得了他所说的不过是一句空话。公开抢老百性的东西，这就是蒋匪军的“王法”。他恼恨万分的回家去了。
    人民解放军打回来了。蒋匪军弃城逃跑的第二天，张掌柜茫然的看着空空如也的货架，和倒在地上的醋缸，还有被拆毁的一些瓦砾堆，回忆起自去年解放军在蒋匪手中解放平谷以来，买卖日渐兴隆的情景——比如过去卖五缸醋，那时就能卖十缸。这种逐渐上升的生活却一下就被蒋匪军糟踏了。想到这里张掌柜恍然大悟，进一步认识了人民解放军是真正人民的军队，蒋匪是卖国害民的军队。【冀东前线二十八日电】
