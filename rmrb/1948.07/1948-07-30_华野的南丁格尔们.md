　　The Florence Nightingales of the East China Field Army

    The female medical and health personnel of the East China Field Army have made remarkable achievements in medical work during the Liberation War in the past two years. They constitute the majority of the East China Field Army's hospital staff. According to recent statistics, they account for 80% to 90% of the staff in the rear health education organs, field and rear hospitals. Even in the battlefield medical organs, they account for more than 30%. Among them, there are not only many skilled female doctors and medical personnel, but also female health department chiefs, hospital directors, and medical team leaders who bear important leadership responsibilities; there are also very young female "little devils" (nurses) and older laundry workers. They work without distinction from their male comrades, and sometimes even do better.
    In order to adapt to large-scale mobile warfare, the General Health Department of the Military Region proposed the policy of "high mobility, large-scale admission" and "where there is fighting, there is admission." In order to actively implement this policy, they underwent rigorous training. They practiced running, climbing obstacles, crossing single-plank bridges, and jumping over ditches. Administratively, it was stipulated that they should run fifteen li per hour with full equipment (backpack and work tools), but some of them actually ran eighteen li. They trained themselves to be like Liberation Army soldiers, able to run with the army on the battlefield, often braving enemy bombing, going in and out of gunfire to rescue the wounded, and persisting in their work. In the Menglianggu campaign to annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's elite 74th Division, a certain hospital rushed to the battlefield overnight. After arriving, they formed a wounded transfer station to receive and transfer the wounded. Due to the small number of staff, they mobilized and organized local rural women, and led them to help with the reception and transfer work. After the wounded arrived at the station, they needed to be registered, medicated, bandaged, and fed, and then transferred to the medical team. Because they organized a large number of liberated women and children to participate, and because of scientific division of labor and skilled movements, it took an average of only about two minutes to receive and transfer a wounded person. The surgical teams, including many female doctors and medical personnel, also had extremely high work efficiency. On average, it took only eight or nine minutes to perform a surgery (from small surgeries such as incisions to large surgeries such as laparotomy and leg amputation). They all worked hard to master their skills. Now, female medical personnel can independently perform general suturing, bullet removal, and other surgeries.
    Under the call of Rao Shushi, Political Commissar of the East China Field Army, to "serve the wounded wholeheartedly," they demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary spirit of selflessness and altruism. Here, we can cite the story of female medical team leader Li Landing as a representative of this spirit. Li Landing and her medical team were jokingly called "Nightingale" and "Nightingale Team" by the East China Field Army, that is, comparing her to the British Florence Nightingale, the founder of battlefield nursing work. This comparison is not wrong. As early as seven years ago, when she was only seventeen years old, Li Landing took on the medical work of the New Fourth Army in the dangerous environment of Japanese and puppet strongholds along the Yangtze River, and has never left the front line since then. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, she often led a dozen or so wounded soldiers to deal with the enemy. On stormy nights, she often crossed the blockade line to move and bury medicine boxes, or groped through dozens of miles of dark roads to supply medicines to the wounded and sick. Long-term fatigue caused her to cough up blood, but she was still unwilling to rest. In the winter of 1944, she transferred several seriously wounded soldiers. When crossing the river, the boat leaked and was about to sink. She immediately took the lead in jumping into the cold, deep water to push the boat ashore, rescuing the wounded and freezing so much that she coughed up blood again. In the autumn of 1946, when our army took the initiative to withdraw from Huaibei, her medical team accommodated more than 500 wounded and sick soldiers at the rear of the troops. At that time, not only were there no medicines, but because the masses had mostly scattered, even stretchers and food were difficult to find. In addition, there were enemy planes bombing overhead, enemy troops chasing behind, and two consecutive days of heavy rain, with water knee-deep, the situation was extremely critical. At this time, she resolutely led the entire team to mobilize local women to carry stretchers, and endured the unbearable fatigue to personally take the lead in carrying them. When she was carrying a heavy stretcher across the river, she lost her footing in the middle of the river due to weak legs and dizziness, and broke her second rib on the left chest. But she still insisted on bringing more than 500 wounded and sick soldiers to southern Shandong without losing a single one.
    There are many such heroines who can be counted in the East China Field Army. Female doctor Jiang Jie, in a major battle, in order to reduce the fatigue of other medical personnel, she changed the dressings of 260 wounds by herself, without resting for a day and a night. Female health worker Jiang Nanping volunteered to carry stretchers and carry the wounded in a certain battle. She had not slept for two days and nights, but she still insisted on going to the front line to rescue people. Under the enemy planes' frantic strafing, her right arm was injured. But disregarding the severe pain of her own wound, she ran into the burning first-aid station and rescued two wounded soldiers. Dressing squad leader Yu Lanxiang, due to poisoning in her work, had undergone six operations, and her arms were covered with scars; her whole body had also suffered from toxic sores. But as soon as she had an operation, she immediately volunteered to help others sort out dressings.
    It is in this way that they have been trained in the war, under the education of the Party, to become capable and loyal quartermasters for the wounded, so that the vast majority of the wounded can quickly return to the troops. In the eight months of cruel war from July 1946 to March 1947, the vast majority of the wounded admitted to the hospital recovered and returned to the team, and only 3.3% died. According to the treatment statistics of the Menglianggu campaign for 45 days, the death rate was only 1.6%. The outstanding contributions of the East China Field Army's medical work to the Liberation War are inseparable from their efforts.

　　华野的南丁格尔们
    华东野战军的女医务卫生人员，两年来在解放战争中的医疗工作上功绩卓著。她们占华东野战军医院工作人员的大部分。据最近统计，在后方的卫生教育机关，野战及后方医院工作人员中，她们占百分之八十到九十。就是在战地的部队医疗机关中，她们也占百分之三十以上。她们中间不仅有许多技术熟练的女医生，女医务员，也有负重要领导责任的纵队卫生部长、院长和医疗队长；有很年轻的女小鬼（护理员）和年岁较大的洗衣员。她们和男同志毫无分别的进行工作，甚至有时还作得更好。
    为适应大规模运动战，军区总卫生部各院都提出：“高度运动，大量收容”、“哪里打仗、哪里收容”方针。她们为积极执行此方针，曾经过了严格的锻炼。她们练习跑路，爬障碍，过独木桥，跳水沟等。行政上规定全副武装（背上背包，带着工作用具）每小时要跑十五里，但是她们竟有的跑到了十八里。她们把自己锻炼得和解放军战士一样，能随军奔驰于战场，经常冒着敌机的轰炸，出入枪林弹雨中抢救伤员，坚持工作。歼灭蒋匪精锐七十四师的孟良崮战役中，某医院连夜赶到战地。到达后就组成伤员转运总站收转伤员。由于工作人员少，她们就动员组织当地农村妇女，并带领她们帮助进行收转工作。伤员到站后，均需经过登记，并分别进行用药、包扎、吃饭等，然后转送医疗队。由于她们组织了大批翻身妇女、儿童参加，由于分工科学、动作熟练，故平均收转一个伤员只用约两分钟的时间。包括许多女医生、女医务员的手术队，工作效率亦极高。平均作一个手术（从切开等小手术到剖腹锯腿等大手术）只用八九分钟。她们都努力于掌握技术。现在一般缝合、取子弹等手术，女医务员们都能单独进行。
    她们在华东野战军饶漱石政委“全心全意为伤员服务”的号召下，表现了高度的舍己为群的革命精神。在这里，我们可以举出女医疗队长李蓝丁的故事作为她们的这种精神的一个代表，李蓝丁和她的医疗队被华野部队双关地称为“南丁”和“南丁队”，就是说，把她比做那个战地护士工作的创始者英国的南丁格尔女士。这个比方是没有错的。早在七年前，还在十七岁的时候，李蓝丁就在长江边日伪据点林立的危险环境中担任了新四军的医疗工作，以后就一直没有离开过前线。在抗日战争时期，她曾经常常带着十几个伤员与敌周旋，在风雨的夜间，她常常穿过封锁线搬移和埋藏药箱，或者摸索几十里的黑路供应伤病员的药品。长期的劳累使她吐了血，但是她仍然不愿意休息。一九四四年冬，她转运几个重伤员，在过河时船漏得快沉了，她立即带头跳入寒冷的深水中推船靠岸，救出伤员而冻得再次吐血。一九四六年秋，我军主动撤离淮北时，她的医疗队在部队最后面收容了五百多伤病员。当时不但没有药品，因为群众大都跑散了，连担架和饮食都很难找，加以上有敌机轰炸，后有敌军追赶，又有两天连下大雨，水深及膝，情况异常危急。这时她毅然率领全队人员动员当地妇女来抬担架，并忍受无比的疲劳亲自领头抬。当她抬着沉重的担架过河时，因腿软头晕，在河心站立不稳而扭断了左胸第二条肋骨。但是她仍然坚持把五百多伤病员带到了鲁南，没有失掉一个。
    象这样的女英雄，在华野部队里还可以数出很多。女医生姜洁，在一次大战役中，为了减轻其他医务人员的疲劳，她一个人一连换完二百六十个伤口的药，一天一夜没有休息。女卫生员蒋南屏在某次战斗中，自告奋勇抬担架背伤员，已经两昼夜没有睡觉了，但是她仍然坚持去火线抢救。在敌机疯狂扫射下，她的右臂负了伤。但是她不顾自己伤口的剧痛，跑进着火的急救所抢出两个伤员。敷料班长于兰香，因工作中中毒，开过六次刀，手膀上满是疤痕；全身亦曾因之害毒疮。但是她刚开过刀，立即又自动去帮助别人整理敷料。
    她们就是这样在战争中，在党的教育下，把自己锻炼成伤员的能干而忠诚的勤务员，而使绝大部分的伤员能迅速的重返部队。一九四六年七月至一九四七年三月八个月残酷的战争中，入院的伤员绝大部分伤愈归队，死亡的则仅百分之三点三。据孟良崮战役四十五天治疗统计，死亡的仅及百分之一点六。华野医务工作对解放战争的这种卓越功绩是和她们的努力分不开的。
