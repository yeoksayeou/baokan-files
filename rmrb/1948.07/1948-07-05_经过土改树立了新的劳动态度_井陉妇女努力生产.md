　　Having Established a New Attitude Towards Labor Through Land Reform

　　Jingxing Women Work Hard in Production

　　[This newspaper dispatch] Jingxing Chengguan women, having been emancipated through land reform, have established the idea of becoming rich through hard work and a new attitude towards labor, actively participating in various forms of production. Last winter, when weathering the famine, women were very common in transportation and sales.谷凤淑, the chairman of the women's association in Chengnai Village, often led thirty or so young women to Niangziguan to carry coal, averaging 70 jin per two people. Two people carried wooden rails, from Nanguan to Zhengshui Station, a round trip of 60 li, earning an average of 3,000 yuan per person per day (border currency, same below). They cooperated with men to transport coal to Pingshan, men driving and women pulling, six people taking turns on a cart, each time carrying a load of six to seven hundred jin. Women who could not travel far carried bricks at nearby small coal mines. The mother of Hei Gou carried 550 bricks a day, earning five and a half jin of rice. Many people actively sewed shoe soles and ran small businesses. Women in Beiguan Village sewed soles for shoe factories, forming groups freely, often sewing collectively, talking and laughing, making it easy to produce work. 李英娥 led five women to complete twenty pairs in less than four days. The chairman of the women's association - 杨玉英, a military dependent, cultivated the 1.7 mu of land she was newly allocated herself, and took time to pick wild tea, exchanged it for eggs, and took a bus to Shijiazhuang to sell. On the way back through Huolu, she bought rags and transported them to Niangziguan, making a trip every two and a half days, earning a net profit of more than 70,000 yuan. All eighty-two able-bodied women in Beiguan did not sit idle and eat. Women in Dongguan Village mostly used the windfall they were allocated as capital to run small businesses. 张凤英, 卢桃清, and 刘二迷 cooperated very well. They usually made shoes for sale, with a division of labor according to skills, some sewing the soles, some attaching the uppers, and some making paper cords and hemp ropes. Every market day, they would set up a small stall with the odds and ends collected from the three families and things people asked them to sell, with one person guarding the stall and two people going to the public-owned store to buy grain, earning 1,000 yuan per dou. 王花荣, 贾彦珍 and ten other families voluntarily pooled more than 800,000 yuan and opened a small coal shop, with three people taking turns managing it. Shares could be withdrawn and deposited at any time, with dividends distributed every half month. More people would operate the shop when business was good, and it might be closed for a few days when there was no business. All the women in Chengguan who had been allocated land participated in field labor. This year, forty-nine women in Chengnai Village have learned how to water gardens and hoe seedlings. The widow 高凤翔 has two children and was allocated two mu of land this year, and she does all the work herself, both in the fields and in the yard. Carrying water and delivering manure has become a very common activity for women. 谷凤淑 said: "In the past, I was embarrassed to carry water, swaying from side to side. Now I am not afraid of the weight on my shoulders, and carrying such heavy coal is nothing." (Reporter Xing Jun)
