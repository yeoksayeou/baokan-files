Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th - TASS, New York, 25th: The National Committee of the American-Soviet Friendship Association launched a movement on June 23rd aimed at mobilizing American public opinion to demand that Truman and the State Department actively negotiate with the Soviet Union, in order to "resolve all outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and the United States, thereby ensuring world peace and tranquility." A few days ago, the association published a declaration in the press signed by more than a hundred prominent Americans, demanding that the US government "stop the Cold War and immediately plan the scale, timing, and location of meetings with Soviet representatives to peacefully resolve our (referring to the US and Soviet) differences." The declaration cited Stalin's and Wallace's statements regarding the possibility of peacefully resolving US-Soviet differences, urging the US government to seize this opportunity to ensure peace. The declaration pointed out that this action "will win the gratitude of millions of war-weary people around the world and will receive the full support of the American people." Signatories to the declaration included former Minnesota Governor Benson, New York City Councilor Connolly, President of the American Jewish Congress Burr, writers Fast, Lawson, Lamont, Secretary-General of the NMU Smith, and President of the TWU Selly, among others.
