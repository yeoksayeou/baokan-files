　　Taihang Administrative Office Education Conference
  　Corrects Blindly Shouting "Vocationalization," Determines Future Focus on Improving Culture
    [Taihang Electric] The Administrative Office here convened an education conference from June 26th to July 10th. Participants included principals of various secondary schools, education section chiefs of various special districts, etc. The conference first criticized and liquidated the guerrilla habits and impractical, blindly shouted "vocationalization" policy that had been developed in education work for many years, emphasizing production, political classes, and integration with central work, even proposing absurd theories that teachers do not need to be literate, as long as their class background is good; students do not need to attend classes, as long as they can labor, no classes, no learning, etc., fundamentally ignoring basic cultural education. For example, Yu Bei Middle School only had eight months of cultural classes in three years, resulting in students not improving their culture and not mastering technology. Therefore, employment is difficult. Based on the abnormal, ununified, and free-flowing state of school education, it was clearly stipulated that the future education policy is to implement a new democratic regular education, focusing on improving cultural level and cultivating various construction talents. In specific practices, it is stipulated that: (1) In terms of cultivation viewpoints, it must be for today's needs (employment) and also for future preparation (advanced studies). (2) Rapidly restore and rectify primary school education, and then move towards regular construction. (3) Combine theory with practice, focusing on learning and combining with practice, focusing on schools and combining with society. The purpose of combining is to enrich learning. (4) Implement new democratic ideological education in various subjects and school life. The nature, tasks, and years of various levels of different schools have been specifically studied. Secondly, the conference examined and criticized all organizational forms and methods of transferring rural class struggle to schools, as well as the so-called slogans of "culture returning to agriculture" and "filling in gaps," and the childish behavior of investigating class, ideology, and work style among seven or eight-year-old primary school students. For teachers and students who were squeezed out during the past investigation of class and squeezing out of feudalism, it was determined that as long as there is no evidence of being a traitor or having serious crimes of sabotage in the land reform, they should all be mobilized to resume their positions and studies on the principle of voluntariness, continue education and transformation, so that they can serve the people. For existing teachers, regardless of new or old, they will all be universally screened once according to the following four conditions: cultural level, career spirit, mass relations, and political thought. Those who are qualified will be retained, otherwise they will be advised to change careers or sent to school for study and training. The so-called political thought is also limited to not opposing the democratic government, and cannot demand too much. In addition, in order to strengthen school leadership, it was determined that middle schools belong to the Administrative Office, simple normal schools belong to the Special District, and senior primary schools belong to the county; and it is stipulated that students shall not be arbitrarily appointed or transferred before the graduation year without the approval of the higher authorities, so as to ensure regular learning.

　　太行行署教育会议
  　纠正盲目喊叫“职业化”确定今后提高文化为主
    【太行电】此间行署于六月二十六日至本月十日召开教育会议。参加者有各中等学校校长，各专署教育科长等。会议首先批判与清算了教育工作上多年来所养成的游击习气与不切合实际的盲目喊叫的“职业化”方针，强调生产，政治课，及与中心工作结合，甚至提出教员不必识字，只要成份好就行；学生不必上课，能劳动就好，不要班次不要学习等荒唐理论，根本忽视了基本的文化教育。如豫北中学三年内只上了八个月文化课，结果学生文化没提高，技术未学通。因而就业困难。根据学校教育上不正常，不统一和自流状态，明确规定今后的教育方针是实行新民主主义的正规教育，以提高文化水平为主，培养各种建设人材。在具体作法上规定：（一）在培养观点上，必须是为今天需要（就业），也为将来作准备（深造）。（二）迅速恢复与整顿小学教育，然后走向正规建设。（三）理论与实际结合、以学习为主结合实际，以学校为主结合社会。结合目的是充实学习。（四）在各种学课与学校生活中贯彻新民主主义的思想教育。对各级不同学校的性质、任务与年限，都具体作了研究。其次，检查与批判了学校中搬运农村阶级斗争的一切组织形式与方法，以及所谓“文化还农”、“填平补齐”的口号、在七八岁小学生中查阶级查思想查作风的儿戏行为。对过去查阶级、挤封建时被挤走的教职员与学生，确定只要不是奸特有据，或有严重的破坏土改罪行者，在其自愿原则下，一律动员复职复学，继续教育改造，使其为人民服务。对现有教员，不论新旧，一律以下列四个条件普遍甄别一次；文化水平，事业精神，群众关系，政治思想。合格者留任，否则劝其转业，或送学校学习培养。所谓政治思想亦只限于不反对民主政府即可，而不能要求过高。另外为加强学校领导，确定中级学校归行署，简师归专署，高小归县；并规定不到毕业年限，不经上级批准，不得随意任用与调动学生，以保证正规学习。
