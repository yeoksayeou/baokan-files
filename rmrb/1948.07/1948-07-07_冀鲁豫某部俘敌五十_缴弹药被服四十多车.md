　　Jiluyu News: On the evening of June 24th, a certain unit of our Jiluyu Military Region, in coordination with a certain unit of the Field Army, launched an offensive against the bandit Chiang’s 68th Division, 143rd Brigade, etc., on the He-Kao Line. The Chiang bandit troops, who had suffered repeated annihilating blows, were terrified and scurried southwestward. The soldiers marched all night, and everyone felt dissatisfied because they had not engaged the enemy. On the morning of the 25th, our unit encountered the transport team of Chiang bandit’s Fourth Pacification Headquarters in Matouji (belonging to Dongming, on the west side of the He-Kao Highway). The enemy escorts completely lost their ability to resist, and more than fifty people were captured alive. Over forty carts full of ammunition, supplies, and clothing were seized by us.

　　冀鲁豫某部俘敌五十
    缴弹药被服四十多车
    【冀鲁豫讯】六月二十四日晚，我冀鲁豫军区某部配合野战军某部向菏考线蒋匪六八师一四三旅等部发动攻势，屡遭歼灭性打击的蒋匪军，闻风丧胆，纷纷向西南鼠窜。战士们走了一夜，因没打上敌人，大家感觉不痛快。二十五日晨，我某部在马头集（东明属，在菏考公路西侧），与蒋匪四绥署司令部运输队遭遇，敌护送官兵完全丧失抵抗力，五十多人全被生俘，四十多辆满载弹药、给养、服装的大车全被我缴获。
