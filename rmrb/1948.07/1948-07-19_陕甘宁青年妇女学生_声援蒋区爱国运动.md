Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Youth, Women, and Students Voice Support for Patriotic Movement in Chiang Area
[Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 17th dispatch] The youth, women, and students of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region sent a telegram to students across the country on the 11th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, expressing support for their patriotic movement against American imperialism's support for Japan. The original telegram is as follows: To all students, teachers, and friends across the country:

The American reactionaries' policy of supporting Japan's aggression against China has aroused extraordinary anger among the people of the whole country. In the Chiang area, you stand at the forefront of the people, breaking through the intimidation, slander, and suppression of the American aggressors and their running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, and bravely launched a just struggle against the evil policies of the American government. We, the youth, women, and students of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, express our infinite respect for your firm and unyielding heroic actions, and extend our warm condolences to the students, teachers, and friends who have suffered persecution from the American and Chiang reactionaries.

Over the past year, our youth, women, and students in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have actively participated in and supported the People's Liberation War to oppose the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, aided by American imperialism, in their slaughter and enslavement of the Chinese people. We have helped the People's Liberation Army eliminate a large number of Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops invading the border region, recovered Yan'an and other lost territories, and liberated the vast number of people in the Chiang area of Shaanxi Province. In the future, we will work even harder to support the People's Liberation War and strive for the complete liberation of the Great Northwest and the realization of a new democratic China.

Dear students, teachers, and friends! The public enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique, are completely isolated. The American reactionaries are nothing more than a "paper tiger" in the face of the great Chinese people. One hundred and sixty million people have been liberated under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the liberation of the whole country is not far away. Let us unite and work together to welcome this great day! Victory belongs to the people.

　　陕甘宁青年妇女学生
    声援蒋区爱国运动
    【新华社西北十七日电】陕甘宁边区青年、妇女、学生，于“七七”抗战十一周年纪念日致电全国学生，声援他们反对美帝扶日的爱国运动。原电如下：全国的同学们、师友们：
    美国反动派扶日侵华的罪恶政策，激起了全国人民异常的愤怒。在蒋区，你们站在人民的最前列，击破了美国侵略者及其走狗蒋介石反动派的恫吓、污蔑和镇压，勇敢的发动了反对美国政府罪恶政策的正义斗争。我们陕甘宁边区的青年、妇女和学生对你们坚强不屈的英勇行动表示无限敬意，对遭受美蒋反动派迫害的同学、师友表示热忱慰问。
    我陕甘宁边区的青年、妇女、学生，为反对美帝援助的蒋介石反动派屠杀奴役中国人民，过去一年多来，积极参加和支援了人民解放战争，帮助人民解放军大量消灭了侵入边区的蒋介石匪军，光复延安和其他失地，并解放了陕西省广大的蒋区人民。今后我们将更加努力的支援人民解放战争，为彻底解放大西北，实现新民主主义的新中国而奋斗。
    亲爱的同学们、师友们！人民公敌蒋介石及其反动集团已陷于完全孤立，美国反动派在伟大的中国人民面前，也不过是一只“纸老虎”。一万万六千万人民已在中国共产党领导下获得了解放，全国的解放已为期不远。让我们团结起来，携手奋斗，迎接这个伟大的日子吧！胜利是属于人民的。
