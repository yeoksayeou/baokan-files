Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: The most extensive project in the second phase of the Bohai Yellow River spring repairs, the dangerous sections of the Huang Dam and Qian Embankment in Mawan, Putai County, were completed in early June. The dam is 22 li long, employing a total of 241,192 workers and using 361,920 cubic meters of earth. In 1937, due to the corruption and neglect of the Kuomintang River Affairs Bureau, a severe flood occurred in the area. The people of Guangrao, Boxing, and Putai counties suffered immense losses, with 300 square li of fertile land submerged under a 1.2-meter-thick layer of gravel. Last year, after the Kuomintang government violated the agreement and blocked the mouth of the Yellow River at Huayuankou in a plot to flood the liberated areas and their military and civilians, the area once again faced the serious threat of the Yellow River's disasters. Therefore, the local people were extremely excited and actively participated in this dam repair led by the democratic government. People from Wuqiao, Zhenhua (formerly Ningjin), Dongguang, Wudi, and Yangxin counties also formed a Yellow River Control Expeditionary Force of more than 16,000 people to participate in the project. During the construction of the river project, a widespread campaign to earn merit was launched, with thousands of river workers receiving recognition, and eleven model companies emerging. The entire project saved more than 71,500 workdays compared to the original plan. Currently, all the river workers in this section have returned to their homes. Local farmers are actively going to the fields to produce and reclaim wasteland.

　　渤海人民奋力抢修蒲台麻湾险工竣工
    【新华社华东十五日电】渤海黄河二期春修中工程最浩大的蒲台县麻湾皇坝和前堤险工，已于六月初竣工。该坝全长廿二里，共用工廿四万一千一百九十二个，用土三十六万一千九百二十方。该地于一九三七年时因国民党河务局腐败失修，造成严重水灾。广饶、博兴、蒲台三县人民损失浩大，三百方里良田为一·二公尺厚的砂砾淹没，去年国民党政府阴谋水淹解放区军民而在花园口违约堵口后，该地即又面临黄祸的严重威胁。因此当地人民对此次民主政府领导修堤，异常兴奋，积极参加。吴桥、振华（原宁津）、东光、无棣、阳信等五县人民并组成一万六千余人的治黄远征军参加工程。河工在修筑中广泛掀起了立功运动，成千河工立了功，并涌现十一个模范连。全部工程较原计划省工七万一千五百余个。现该段治黄民工已全部复员。当地农民正积极上地生产，开垦荒地。
