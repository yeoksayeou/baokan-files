Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, July 7th: In order to consolidate finance, develop production, stabilize prices, and prosper the market in the Central Plains Liberated Area, and also to relieve the disaster suffered by the people of the Central Plains due to the continuous plummeting of the Kuomintang currency, the democratic government established the Central State Farmers Bank in late May, issuing a single unit currency. The North Sea Bank and Jinnan Bank notes used at the beginning of the People's Liberation Army's advance will be gradually withdrawn by the democratic government at a fixed price. At present, the bank has established branches in the administrative offices of western Henan, Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, Jianghan, and Tongbai, and in the areas under the jurisdiction of the special commissioner's offices, as well as in towns such as Luoyang and Zhoujiakou. The credit of the Central State currency is increasing daily in various places. At the end of May, one yuan of Central State currency was worth 3,000 Kuomintang dollars, and it has now risen to over 6,000 yuan. The prices of general daily necessities are becoming increasingly stable.

    【新华社中原七日电】中原解放区民主政府为了巩固金融、发展生产、稳定物价、繁荣市场的需要，同时也为了解除中原人民因蒋币不断狂跌所受的灾害，已于五月下旬成立中州农民银行，发行单一本位币。解放军进军之初所使用之北海银行与冀南银行钞票，则由民主政府按价逐渐收回。现该行已于豫西、豫皖苏、江汉、桐柏等行政公署和所属各专署所辖地区内以及洛阳、周家口等城镇成立分支行；中州币流通各地信誉日增。五月底中州票每元合蒋币三千元，现已涨至六千元以上。一般日用必须品物价日见平稳。
