　　Briefs on Industry and Commerce
    △Handan City is located between Yuzhou and Qizhou (Anguo), the nationally renowned centers of the medicinal herb industry, and is surrounded by medicinal herb-producing areas. It serves as a hub for exchange and distribution. The democratic government has provided multifaceted support to the city's industry and commerce. In March of this year, it initiated and held a medicinal herb conference, which further developed the city's medicinal herb industry. According to June statistics, six new wholesale establishments for Chinese medicine were added, bringing the total to forty-eight (including mountain produce and medicinal herb warehouses). On average, over fifty merchants from Jiang-occupied areas such as Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Hankou, Jinan, and Anyang come to Handan to purchase medicinal herbs daily. The number of merchants coming from various liberated areas is even greater. In June, over 663,000 jin of various medicinal herbs were put on the market, with a total transaction value of over 70 million yuan (J冀钞 currency). The income of each medicinal herb merchant in June increased fivefold compared to the average of previous months before April. Since the trade relations with Sichuan and Guangdong for medicinal herbs were opened, large quantities of outside herbs have arrived, and the export volume of yams has been quite large. The previous phenomenon of incomplete medicinal herbs has been overcome. In order to accelerate the large-scale export of mountain produce and medicinal herbs, drugstores such as Dasheng and Qingsheng are preparing to establish pharmaceutical societies and research departments to process local herbs into medicinal powders and ointments for easy transportation and consumption.
    △During the review in Feicheng last year, the policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce was violated. The Xiangji Tea House was struggled against, causing panic among all industrial and commercial households in the city. During this correction, various mass and industrial and commercial household meetings were held to repeatedly conduct education on industrial and commercial policies, persuading the masses to return all of the confiscated house of Xiangji Tea House, tea worth 1.2 million J冀钞 currency, and furniture. The industrial and commercial households in the city gradually stabilized. On the first market day after the return, eight more grain shops were added. More than 180 shi were transacted, more than double the past.
    △After returning the wrongly struggled industrial and commercial entities in Chengci Town, the government issued loans to support the development of industry and commerce. In just over two months, thirty-five new shops have been added: including four sundry goods shops, one cigarette factory, as well as oil shops, dyeing shops, pharmacies, and flour mills. Some businesses are also repairing storefronts and purchasing furniture, preparing to open and expand their business.
    △Since the correction of deviations in Jincheng Chengguan's industry and commerce, it has gradually moved towards prosperity. The total number of established businesses and street vendors in the city has increased from 995 to 1,041. The newly added businesses are mostly small handicraft factories and workshops such as iron factories, clothing bureaus, and shoe shops. The thirty-one public and joint public-private workshops and stores have been transferred to private operation one after another. Many handicraftsmen and small factory owners are preparing to resume or expand their business.

　　工商简讯
    △邯郸市位于驰名全国的药业中心禹州、祁州（安国）之间，周围都是产药区，多由该市交流集散。民主政府对该市工商业多方扶植，于今年三月间倡开药材大会，会后该市药业更有发展。据六月份统计，中药业新增批发庄六家，连前共达四十八家（山货药材栈在内）。由蒋占区新乡、郑州、汉口、济南、安阳等地来邯买办药材的商人，每日平均有五十余人。由各解放区来此的商人为数更多。六月份上市的各种药材达六十六万三千余斤，交易总额在七万万元（冀钞）以上；各药商六月份的收入。比四月份以前各月平均数增加五倍。自打通川广药材贸易关系后，外面药材大批到来，山药出口为数颇大。过去药材不全的现象已经克服。为了加速山货药材大批出口，大生、庆生等药庄正筹备设制药社研究部，把土药制成药粉、药膏，便于运输服用。

    △肥城在去年复查时，违反了保护与发展工商业的政策，斗争了祥记茶庄，引起全城工商户的恐慌。这次纠偏时，召开各种群众和工商户会议，反复进行工商业政策教育，说服群众将没收祥记茶庄的房子，价值冀钞一百二十万元的茶叶及家具全部退回。全城工商户逐渐稳定，退还后的第一个集上，粮行就增加了八座。成交一百八十多石，超过过去一倍以上。
    △成磁城内，退还错斗工商业后，政府又发贷款，扶植工商业发展。两个多月内，新添铺户三十五家：计有杂货铺四家，卷烟厂一家及油店、染坊、药铺、磨面坊等。还有一些商号正在修理门面，置买家具，准备开张和扩大营业。
    △晋城城关工商业自纠偏以来，逐渐走向繁荣，全城坐商摊贩已由九百九十五家增至一千零四十一家。新增商号多为铁工厂、成衣局、鞋铺等手工业小工厂和作坊。公营和公私合营的三十一座作坊商店已先后转让给私人经营。还有不少手工业者和小工厂主都在准备复业或扩大营业。
