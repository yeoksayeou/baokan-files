Beiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office

　　Emphasize Seizing the Time for Replanting and Disaster Relief

　　Issue Urgent Instructions and Provide Specific On-the-Ground Leadership

[Beiyue News] The Jianping and Pingshan counties along the Hutuo River suffered particularly severe flooding. According to the masses, the river swelled dramatically on the 22nd and 23rd of this month, the worst since 1939. Much of the wasteland along the river in Jianping was washed away. In Hongzidian, only one out of twenty households outside the two attics remained. In Pingshan, the Dading Weir of the Dachuan Canal was destroyed, many canals were silted up, and much of the land along the small rivers was washed away; more than 200 mu were washed away in Donghuishe, and more than 100 mu were silted up in Nanwanglou. In the first district of Pingshan, 9,658 mu of crops were flooded, with some fields submerged in two to three feet of water for three or four days. The flooded land urgently needs to be replanted or supplemented. Almost all of the cotton on more than one qing of land in Dongwanglou needs to be replanted. After the Beiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee repeatedly sounded the alarm in the People's Daily, pointing out the dangers of Pingshan's laissez-faire attitude towards production, it immediately grasped the above situation and issued urgent instructions, pointing out that it is imperative for all counties to vigorously plant late autumn crops. "Seize the time to plant," "seize the time to reclaim wasteland," and "prevent floods and rush to rescue" to properly resettle the disaster-stricken people. The Beginning of Autumn (solar calendar) on August 7th is less than half a month away. If we do not seize the time to replant, we will miss the agricultural season and there will be no way to remedy the situation. (1) If the masses have difficulty obtaining seeds for late planting, they should be urged to find ways to purchase them themselves, or to help each other; the production promotion cooperatives should immediately purchase seeds to assist in coordination. (2) To solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power, mutual aid should be promoted. In areas where labor is particularly scarce, the masses should be organized to carry out "assaults" in the form of large-scale labor. Due to the large number of livestock working in Jingxing, Pingshan, and Jianping counties, it is necessary to effectively coordinate solutions. Villages with more livestock can send some to help villages with less livestock, trading labor for work, with fodder provided by the users. (3) Organize as many personnel from government agencies and schools as possible, as well as pack mules and horses, to vigorously help the masses replant. The instructions also pointed out that in the process of replanting and supplementing, special attention should be paid to investigating and reclaiming wasteland, clearly identifying the amount of wasteland, the reasons for it, and providing concrete solutions. For the land abandoned by military families and revolutionary martyrs due to lack of labor, it is necessary to resolutely organize people to cultivate it on their behalf. Landlords and old rich peasants who abandon land because they dislike its poor quality can be forced to plant it; wasteland abandoned due to undetermined land rights (such as military land or land not yet distributed) should be reclaimed by mobilizing the masses. The wasteland reclaimed during this planting will be exempt from burdens this year. When reclaiming wasteland, households affected by the floods this time should have priority. Regarding flood prevention and emergency rescue, the flood control projects that have been destroyed should be supervised for repair, and those that have not been destroyed but are in danger should be inspected and prevented. Those that need to be added should be added as soon as possible. For particularly large projects, the Commissioner's Office can subsidize part of the river management costs. For low-lying, damp land, drainage methods should be studied with the masses, and tree planting during the rainy season should be combined with flood prevention. Regarding the resettlement of disaster-stricken households, the village should be responsible for helping those without housing to find temporary accommodation. Those who have suffered serious losses due to the collapse of houses and have problems with their livelihoods should be given appropriate relief from the existing production loan grains in each county. At present, the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office have formed two shock work groups, led by Deputy Commissioner Wang and Section Chief Han of the Industry Section, to go to Jingxing, which suffered from severe drought in the past, and the disaster-stricken villages along the Hutuo River to carry out shock reclamation and emergency rescue. At the same time, personnel from all departments at the district level have been prepared to help the masses in the villages with replanting in an organized manner.

　　北岳四地委暨专署
  　重视抢种救灾
  　一面发出紧急指示同时下乡具体领导
    【北岳讯】滹沱河畔的建屏、平山两县，水灾异常严重，据群众谈：本月二十二、三日河水暴涨，为一九三九年以来最大的一次。建屏沿河荒滩大部冲光，洪子店两阁外二十来户，冲得只剩了一家。平山大川渠的大顶堰被冲毁，不少水渠淤塞，许多沿小河的土地亦被冲毁不少；东回舍冲坏二百多亩，南望楼百多亩被淤。平山一区被淹坏的田禾达九千六百五十八亩，好些田地积水二、三尺，三四天未退，被灾土地极需改种或补种，东望楼一顷多地的棉花，几乎需要全部改种。北狱四地委在人民日报数次敲警钟即指出平山生产自流的警惕下，随即抓紧了上述情况，特发出紧急指示，指出各县全力种植晚秋作物，刻不容缓。“抢种”“抢荒”“防洪、抢险”切实安置受灾群众。现立秋（阳历）八月七日已不距到半月，如不抓紧抢种，就会错过农时，无法补救。（一）群众进行晚种，种籽困难，应督促群众自己想法购买，或互助周济；生产推进社要立即购买，协助调剂。（二）为解决人力畜力的困难，应提倡拨工互助，在劳力特别缺乏地区，应组织群众用大拨工的形式进行“突击”。井陉、平山、建屏三县因牲口大量出勤，更需切实设法调剂解决，牲口较多村庄可抽调一部前往牲口缺乏村庄帮助，顶战勤工，草料由使用户供给。（三）尽量组织机关学校人员及驮骡马匹，大力帮助群众抢种。指示并指出：抢种补种中要特别注意查荒抢荒，切实查明荒地数量多少，什么原因，要具体解决。军工烈属因无劳力荒的土地，要坚决组织代耕种好。地主旧富农嫌地坏而荒了的可强制他种；因地权未确定（如军田或暂未分出的地）而荒了的则应发动群众抢荒，此次抢种的荒地，今年一律不出负担。抢荒时，此次遭水灾户应有优先权。关于防洪抢险，已被冲毁的防洪工程要督促修筑，未被冲而有危险的应该检查防止，需增修的赶快增修，工程特大的，专署可补助一部治河费。下洼阴湿土地，应与群众研究泄水办法，雨季植树应与防洪结合进行。关于安置受灾户，没房住的应由村里负责帮助筹划借住。因房屋倒塌受到严重损失，生活发生问题的，由各县现存生产贷粮中酌情救济。现地委、专署已组成两个突击工作组，由王副专员及实业科韩科长率领，分赴过去旱灾较重的井陉及滹沱河两岸受灾村进行突击抢荒，与抢险。同时分区一级各机关人员，已准备有组织地帮助驻村群众抢种。
