[Jizhong Electric] Bafang Village is a poor village in Anguo County. The whole village has 272 households, 1,252 people, and 3,346 mu of land (more than 1,001 mu of irrigated land, more than 1,044 mu of dry land, and 1,300 mu of alkaline land), averaging 2.66 mu per person. The whole village has 249.5 male laborers (including 81 semi-laborers), averaging 13.14 mu of land per person. There are 70 head of draught animals, averaging 47.8 mu of land per head. There are 20 waterwheels and 107 wells. With a large population and little land, and poor soil quality, the annual output is far from sufficient. Last year, the village harvested more than 3,526 shi of grain; the village needs at least 3,467 shi of grain annually. After paying public grain, there is still a shortage of 359 shi. In the past, except for four landlord households, fourteen rich peasant households, and thirteen well-to-do middle peasant households, no one in the village had enough to eat. The whole village averages a shortage of six months of firewood.

Due to the correction of "leftist" deviations, such as the idea of struggling against the rich among the middle peasants, the burden policy that only considers the actual output of the current year regardless of diligence or laziness, with more burden for more harvest and less burden for less harvest, and the parasitic ideas of relying on struggle and relief, the masses' production enthusiasm in the village began to rise, and sideline occupations also began to develop. Two hundred people in the village know how to use a saw, and there are thirteen bricklayers and kiln workers. Jointly operated businesses include 23 lumber mills, four cotton ginning houses, two households pulling carts for hire, and those engaged in transportation and sales. Women are very active in production. The whole village has 331 female laborers, 290 spinning wheels, and 70 looms. Many families' pocket money and clothing are mostly solved by women's spinning and weaving. According to imprecise calculations, sideline income accounts for half of the village's total income.

How were these production achievements obtained?

This is because the branch began to attach importance to production leadership after correcting deviations, and party members and cadres actively took the lead. After the land reform in the village, the branch took leading large-scale production as the central task. A village production committee was established. The district cadre stationed in the village, in coordination with the branch, convened a meeting of all party members and cadres, calling on party members and cadres to organize themselves and take the lead in production. First, they should do a good job in their own production, and then each person should find some targets to specifically help and organize. A relatively detailed study was made at the meeting, where everyone raised their difficulties and came up with solutions. After the party's internal thinking was unified, a meeting of peasant association members and the entire village masses was convened, and individual masses were talked to, promoting that they should be organized to produce: "We, the emancipated peasants, have land and production tools, so we should actively produce to get rich. Only by developing production can we ensure thorough emancipation. Otherwise, we will still inevitably suffer from poverty." While publicizing, they began to organize. Liu Fenglin, the director of the peasant association, Liu Laodui, the organization committee member of the branch, and ten other households took the lead in organizing. In the past, there was a shortage of labor, and agriculture and sideline occupations could not be taken care of. Organization saved labor. Not only did they do a good job in the fields, but they also had five surplus laborers to open lumber mills, saw wood, go to kilns, and engage in transportation and sales, earning a lot of money. They took out 3.3 million yuan (border currency, same below) from their earnings to buy a waterwheel; opening a lumber mill solved the firewood problem. When the peasants saw this living fact, they all envied and said: "Look how convenient it is to be organized, the crops are not delayed, and they also make money. One person always takes care of this and can't take care of that! Let's organize ourselves too!" The leadership seized this demand of the masses, widely publicized the situation of the Liu Fenglin group, and mobilized everyone to organize. Of the 62 party members in the village, 46 participated in mutual aid teams. Many masses also organized.

When the branch found the correct direction to organize production, many masses had many ideological concerns. This was due to the "leftist" deviations in past work, mainly struggling against middle peasants, not paying attention to policies in all work, especially the burden policy, and the style of coercion and command. For example, some middle peasants were afraid of "large-scale collectivization" after the land reform, some were afraid of being struggled against after living a good life and becoming prosperous, and some were afraid of the burden increasing if the crops grew well. Some poor peasants relied on government loans and did not actively think about production on their own. The branch wanted to carry out production, but it immediately encountered this major obstacle, so it vigorously publicized that it would resolutely not infringe on the interests of middle peasants, and persuaded the masses to return the things of the three middle peasant households that were obviously wrongly struggled against. When the middle peasants saw that the wrongly struggled things were really returned, they began to feel at ease. This year's wheat requisition was also collected according to the border government's instructions, that is, according to the long-term expected yield, which further stabilized and improved everyone's production enthusiasm. The villagers said: "It is more dignified to be diligent and thrifty. If you harvest more grain, you don't have to pay more burden. Laziness is both embarrassing and conspicuous." In order to reward and inspire labor mutual aid, the poor peasant association used 16 million yuan of floating wealth to buy seven large cattle, plus five mules and nine large carts that were struggled out, and lent them to the mutual aid teams for use. Whoever organized would be helped. For those who were really in difficulty, the government provided loan assistance. The whole village issued 5.2 million yuan in water conservancy loans, combined with some private capital, repaired five waterwheels, bought a new waterwheel, and repaired two wells. This broke the masses' misconception that the superiors "only talked but did not solve practical difficulties."

The village used high-pitched loudspeakers, blackboards, and schools to introduce production methods from other places, commend production models, and good mutual aid teams; and urged and educated lazy people, which received good results. The lazy man Cheng Zhaoshuan loved to eat, gamble, and whore. After he was broadcasted on the radio station without naming him, he immediately said: "I must change in the future." Now Cheng Zhaoshuan has joined the mutual aid team and is actively producing.

The mutual aid team adopted the practice of the masses freely forming teams and setting their own rules. Entry and exit from the team are completely free and never forced; the mutual aid methods and regulations are determined by the masses themselves and are not required to be uniform. In this way, the masses rushed to find partners to form teams. Liu Laowen said: "Those who organized earlier have benefited." Some said: "Whoever cannot get mutual aid has no popularity."

At present, there are 23 teams in the village, with 116 households, accounting for 42.6% of the total number of households in the village. The 589 people participating in the mutual aid teams account for 40% of the total population of the village (including organized full male laborers, accounting for 57% of the total number of full male laborers in the village). The 1,314 mu of land that has been organized accounts for 39% of the total land in the village. The 26 livestock that have been organized account for 37% of the total livestock.

After being organized, in addition to agricultural mutual aid, sideline production was also carried out. Opening a lumber mill solved 141,300 jin of firewood (calculated at the current market price, equivalent to 70.65 million yuan), obtaining 4,730 jin of rice and a profit of 54.43 million yuan.

The situation of Bafang's organization illustrates several issues: (1) To carry out production, we must first correct deviations (if there are deviations). Correcting deviations is active, not passive. Only when the masses truly grasp the party's correct policies can the society be stable, all classes be united, and everyone be willing to carry out production. Many places advocate production, but production is always not energetic. One of the main reasons is that deviations are not corrected, and even intentionally covered up. (2) For poor villages to organize production, agriculture and sideline occupations must be combined so that labor can be fully utilized, income can be increased, and the masses' living difficulties can be appropriately resolved, so that agriculture and sideline occupations are not delayed. (3) Labor mutual aid must follow the principles of voluntariness and equal value and mutual benefit, otherwise it will not be consolidated and will collapse. However, equal value must be suitable for the masses' psychology and can only work if discussed by the masses themselves. It must be gradually improved on the basis of the masses' emotional combination and natural equal value, so that no one suffers losses. (4) To organize mutual aid, labor, livestock, capital, and technology must be combined to achieve multi-party combination, so that it can be consolidated and developed smoothly.

Editor's note: After the land reform, the Bafang Village branch immediately shifted its work direction to large-scale production and found that correcting "leftist" deviations, straightening out various policies, stabilizing social order, and improving the masses' production enthusiasm were prerequisites for carrying out the large-scale production movement. These are all correct. However, the remnants of "leftist" deviations still exist. For example, without any procedures, the poor peasant association arbitrarily distributed the fruits of the whole village's collective wealth to mutual aid teams that did not include all the peasants, and only helped those who organized, which of course means that there was no voluntariness or equal value. The Bafang Village branch is expected to make efforts to correct such things.

　　八方村纠正左偏解除农民顾虑
  　党员干部作出样子推动全村组织生产
    【冀中电】八方村是安国的一个穷村，全村共有二百七十二户，一千二百五十二口人，三千三百四十六亩地（水地一千零一亩多，旱地一千零四十四亩多，碱地一千三百亩），每人平均二·六六亩。全村男劳动力二百四十九个半（内有半劳力八十一个），平均每人种地十三·一四亩。耕畜七○头，平均每头耕地四十七亩八分。水车二十辆，水井一○七眼。人多地少，地质又坏，每年产量远不够用。去年全村共收获粮食三千五百二十六石多；全村每年最少需粮三千四百六十七石，出了公粮负担，尚缺三五九石。过去村里除四户地主、十四户富农、十三户富裕中农外，没有一户够吃的。全村平均缺六个月的烧柴。
    由于纠正了左倾偏向，如斗争中农的斗富思想，不管勤懒只按当年实际产量，收多负担多、收少负担少的负担政策，以及靠斗争靠救济吃饭的二流子思想等，该村群众生产情绪开始高起来，副业也开始发达起来。全村会拉锯的有二百人，泥瓦工、窑工十三人。合伙经营的买卖计有二十三座木厂，四个轧花房，两户拉脚的，还有跑运销的。妇女生产很积极，全村女劳动力三百三十一个，纺车二百九十辆，织布机七十张，许多人家的零花穿衣，多从妇女纺织中解决，据不精确的计算，副业收入占全村总收入的一半。
    这些生产成绩是怎样得来的呢？
    这是由于支部在纠偏以后，开始重视生产领导，党员干部积极带头。该村土改后，支部就以领导大生产为中心工作。成立了村生产委员会。住村的区干部协同支部召开了全体党员干部会议，号召党员干部组织起来带头生产。首先把自己的生产搞好，每个人再找一些对象，具体帮助与组织。会上作了比较精细的研究，由大家提出各自的困难，想出了解决的办法。党内思想统一了，接着召开了农会会员和全村群众大会，又和个别群众漫谈，宣传应该组织起来生产：“我们翻身农民有了土地、生产工具，就应该积极生产发家致富，只有发展生产，才能保证彻底翻身。否则还是免不了受穷。”一面宣传，一面着手组织。农会主任刘凤林、支部组织委员刘老对等十户先组织起来。过去劳力缺乏，农副业不能兼顾。组织起来省了工，不但把地里活作好，还节余了五个劳动力开木厂、拉锯、上窑、跑运销，赚钱很多。他们把赚的钱抽出三百三十万元（边币，下同）买了一辆水车；开木厂解决了烧柴问题。农民们看见这个活生生的事实，都羡慕的说：“看人家组织起来多方便，庄稼误不了，又赚了钱。一个人总是顾了这照顾不了那呀！咱们也组织起来吧！”领导上抓住群众这种要求，广泛宣传刘凤林小组的情况，动员大家组织起来，全村六十二个党员，有四十六个参加了互助组。许多群众也组织起来了。
    当支部找到了正确方向组织生产的开始，不少群众存在着不少的思想顾虑，这是历年来工作中的左倾偏向，主要是斗中农，一切工作不讲求政策，特别是负担政策，以及强迫命令的作风所致。比如有些中农怕土改后“大合伙”，有的怕过好了日子即生活富裕后再被斗，有的怕庄稼长好了负担加多。有些贫农依赖政府贷款，自己不积极想法生产。支部要进行生产，但拍头就碰见了这一大障碍，便大力宣传，坚决不侵犯中农利益，并说服群众，将显然是错斗的三户中农的东西退了回去。中农看见错斗的真退回去了，心里才开始有了底子。今年的麦征又按照边府指示，即按长年应产量征收，更稳定与提高了大家的生产情绪，老乡们都说：“看勤俭了多体面，多打了粮食，不多拿负担，懒了既丢人又显眼。”为了奖励与启发劳动互助，贫农团用浮财一千六百万元，买了七头大牛，再加上斗争出来的五个骡子、九辆大车，也借给了互助组使用。谁组织起来就帮助谁。对真正困难的，政府予以贷款帮助，全村共发放水利贷款五百二十万元，结合一部私资，修理了五辆水车，买了一辆新水车，修理了两眼井。打破了群众认为上级“光动嘴不解决实际困难”的错觉。
    该村利用高房广播、黑板报和学校，介绍别处生产办法，表扬生产模范，和好的互助组；对懒汉懒婆进行督促教育，收到了很好的效果。懒汉程造拴爱吃爱赌爱嫖，在广播台上不指名的广播了他以后，他立刻表示：“今后一定要改了。”现在程造拴已参加了互助组，积极生产起来。
    互助组采用了群众自由结组，自定制度的作法。出入组完全自由，绝不强迫；互助办法章程由群众自己规定，不强求一致。这样一来，群众便纷纷找对象结组，刘老温说：“先组织起来的沾光了”。有的说：“谁互助不起来就是没有人缘。”
    目前全村共有二十三组，一百一十六户。占全村总户数的百分之四二·六。参加互助组的五百八十九人，占全村总人口的百分之四十（内有组织起来的整男劳力，占全村男整劳力的百分之五十七）。组织起来的土地共一三一四亩，占全村总地数百分之三十九。组织起来的牲口二十六个，占总牲口数的百分之三十七。
    组织起来后，除农业互助外，还开展副业生产，开木厂解决烧柴十四万一千三百斤（按当前市价，折款为七千零六十五万元），得米四千七百三十斤，获利五千四百四十三万元。
    八方组织起来的情况说明了几个问题：（一）要想进行生产，首先必须进行纠偏（如果有偏的话），纠偏是积极的不是消极的，让群众真正掌握了党的正确政策后，才能使社会安定，各阶层团结，大家才愿意进行生产。许多地方提倡生产，但总是生产不起劲，主要原因之一就是有偏不纠，甚至有意的掩盖偏。（二）穷村组织生产必须农副业相结合，劳动力才能得到高度的发挥，增加收入，群众生活困难才能得到适当解决，才能做到农副两不误。（三）劳动互助，必须依照自愿和等价两利的原则，否则就不会巩固而会垮台。但等价必须适合群众的心理，由群众自己讨论才能行得通。必须在群众感情结合和自然等价的基础上逐步提高，作到互不吃亏。（四）组织互助，必须人畜力相结合，资本与技术相结合，作到多方结合，才能巩固和顺利的发展。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：八方村支部在土改后就立即把工作方向转入大生产，并找到了纠正左倾偏向，端正各种政策，安定社会秩序，提高群众生产情绪，为开展大生产运动的先决条件，这都是正确的。但左倾偏向的残余依然存在，如未经任何手续，贫农团便独断专行的把全村共有的果实浮财分给了并不包括全体农民的互助组使用，而且是谁组织起来才帮助谁，这当然也就谈不到自愿等价了。诸如此类，望八方村支部努力予以纠正。
