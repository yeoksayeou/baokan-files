Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th: The Northwest Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China convened a cadre meeting of over a thousand people at the Bianfu Auditorium in Yan'an on July 1st to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The meeting, chaired by Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, announced that this commemorative meeting was also a study mobilization rally, calling on all Party members and cadres to intensify their studies, master policies, resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's line, and welcome the victory of liberating the Great Northwest. Comrade Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Border Region Government, Comrade He Long, Commander of the Northwest Joint Defense Army, and Comrade Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, each gave important reports on studying Mao Zedong's thought methods, implementing the Central Committee's line and policies, and overcoming the serious state of anarchy and lack of discipline that still existed in various Party, government, and military departments in the Northwest.

　　Chairman Lin, after briefly reporting on the history of the Party and its lessons, especially emphasized that some cadres in the Northwest still lacked the spirit of consciously abiding by discipline, criticism, and self-criticism. Some local cadres were unwilling to work in new areas; some outside cadres were not content to work in the border area; some technical cadres emphasized their own particularity and neglected political study; in supporting the front and war service and production and disaster relief work, there were serious compulsory orders and formalism and bureaucraticism; in land reform and rectification, some areas also showed insufficient speed and resolution in implementing policies. These are all manifestations of disobedience to discipline, failure to implement policies, impure Party spirit, and irresponsibility to the people. Chairman Lin called on all Party members and cadres to strictly examine themselves in future studies according to the spirit of the documents, learn as long as they live, and continuously improve themselves politically, ideologically, and culturally, to better serve the people. Chairman Lin further emphasized that the key to the success or failure of the future study movement lies in whether leading comrades at all levels earnestly study themselves and whether they regard leading study as an important task of their own work. Therefore, he called on leading comrades at all levels to truly lead by example and become good organizers and leaders of the entire study movement.

　　Commander He, based on the spirit of the two documents, the "Preface to the Second Chapter of 'Left-Wing Communism, an Infantile Disorder' Reprinted" and the "Notice on Commemorating 'July 1st' and 'July 7th'" of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, reminded all Party members and cadres to review the following erroneous tendencies in this study: (1) localism of each doing things in his own way and acting as he pleases; (2) failure to carefully study and earnestly implement the Central Committee's lines and policies; (3) dealing with issues of principle and policy without authorization, without asking for instructions beforehand and without reporting afterwards; (4) lack of mass viewpoint, failure to reflect the real situation of the masses to the higher authorities, exaggeration of achievements, concealment of errors; (5) deciding whether to implement the instructions of higher authorities according to personal or unit preferences; (6) choosing jobs not according to the needs of the Party but according to their own interests, and working passively in jobs they dislike; (7) work is sluggish and delayed, not abiding by the system, irresponsible, disregarding the overall situation, and not paying attention to efficiency; (8) liberalism, spreading gossip, not talking or talking little about work when meeting, but talking more about trivial matters of life. Commander He demanded that all Party members and cadres seriously treat their mistakes and launch a struggle against the lack of Party spirit and undisciplined phenomena. In order to achieve the unity of will, action, style, and discipline of the whole Party, establish centralized leadership, and strive to thoroughly implement the line and policies of the Party Central Committee.

　　Comrade Ma Mingfang specifically analyzed the various undesirable ideological tendencies such as individualism, liberalism, and commandism that exist in some Party members and cadres, and demanded that they be thoroughly corrected in the study, so that all Party members and cadres can improve a step and welcome victory.

　　延安学习动员大会号召
    加紧学习掌握政策
    【新华社西北十二日电】七月一日，中共西北中央局特于延安边府礼堂召开千余人的干部大会，纪念中国共产党诞生二十七周年。大会由西北局书记习仲勋同志主席，宣布此一纪念大会亦为学习动员大会，号召所有党员、干部加紧学习，掌握政策，坚决执行党中央的路线，迎接解放大西北的胜利。边府主席林伯渠同志、西北联防军司令员贺龙同志及西北局副书记马明芳同志，均就学习毛泽东思想方法、执行中央路线、政策，克服西北党政军各部门还存在着的某一严重的无政府无纪律状态，分别作重要报告。
    林主席在简要报告党的历史及其教训后，特别强调指出西北某些干部至今还缺乏自觉遵守纪律、批评与自我批评的精神。有些本地干部不愿到新区工作；有些外来干部不安心在边区工作；有些技术干部强调本身的特殊性，忽视政治学习；在支前战勤及生产救灾工作中，存在着严重的强迫命令与形式主义、官僚主义的作风；在土改纠编中，某些地区也有执行政策不够迅速坚决的表现。这些都是不服从纪律、不执行政策、党性不纯、对人民不负责任的表现。林主席号召全体党员、干部，在今后学习中，根据文件的精神，严格检查自己，活到老，学到老，在政治上、思想上、文化上不断提高自己，更好地为人民服务。林主席更着重指出今后学习运动成败的关键，在于各级领导同志自己是否认真学习与是否把领导学习当作是自己工作的重要任务。因此他号召各级领导同志真正以身作则，并成为整个学习运动的好的组织者与领导者。
    贺司令员根据中共中央宣传部“重印‘左派幼稚病’第二章前言”与“关于纪念‘七一’和‘七七’通知”两个文件的精神，提醒全体党员、干部要在这次学习中检讨下述各种错误倾向：（一）各自为政和各行其是的地方主义；（二）对中央的路线和政策，不细心研究和认真执行；（三）对待原则性、政策性的问题，擅自处理，事前不请示，事后不报告；（四）缺乏群众观点，不向上级反映群众的真实情况，夸大成绩，隐瞒错误；（五）对上级指示，按照个人或本单位的好恶，决定执行或不执行；（六）不根据党的需要而是根据自己的兴趣来选择工作岗位，对自己不喜欢的工作消极怠工；（七）工作疲塌拖延，不守制度，不负责任，不顾全局，不讲效率；（八）自由主义、小广播，见面不谈或少谈工作，对生活琐事却讲的多。贺司令员要求全体党员、干部严肃地对待自己的错误，与缺乏党性、没有纪律的现象展开斗争。以求达到全党意志、行动、作风和纪律的统一，树立集中领导，为彻底实现党中央的路线和政策而奋斗。
    马明芳同志具体分析了某些党员、干部中存在着的个人主义、自由主义、命令主义等各种不良思想倾向，并要求在学习中彻底纠正，以使全体党员、干部提高一步，迎接胜利。
