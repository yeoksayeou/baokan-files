　　Jiang Area Newspaper Reveals:
    Taiyuan's People's Hearts Are With Us
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd] Jinan Cheng Bao recently published a Taiyuan dispatch stating: A reporter once asked Yan Xishan about the people's sentiments. Yan said despondently, giving two examples: (1) In order to understand the condition of the soldiers, he had sent ten cadres to "go deep into the troops" to get close to the soldiers. The following incident occurred: A new recruit who had only joined the Kuomintang for three days said to the soldiers, "The Communist Party is the benefactor of the poor! Do you agree?" Everyone said, "Yes." Then the new recruit loudly said, "Why should we help our enemies kill our benefactors?" (2) At the preparatory meeting for the "Defend Taiyuan Mobilization Meeting" held in Taiyuan, someone said, "What's the point of holding this meeting? What does defending Taiyuan have to do with us? Life will be better for us when the Communists come!" Bandit Yan then said, "These two sentences alone are shocking!"

　　蒋区报纸透露：
    太原民心向我
    【新华社华东二十三日电】济南诚报近刊太原通讯称：曾有记者向阎锡山询及民心倾向问题，阎沮丧的说了两个例子，（一）他为着了解士兵状况，曾派去十个干部“深入部队”去接近士兵，出现了这样一件事：有一个加入国民党才三天的新兵向士兵们说：“共产党是穷人的恩人！你们说对不对？”大家都说“对”。那新兵才大声说：“我们为什么要帮助我们的仇人杀我们的恩人？”（二）在太原召开“保卫太原动员会”的预备会上，有人说：“开这个会干什么，保卫太原与我们有什么相干？共产党来了我们的日子比现在好呢！”阎贼接着说：“以上这两句话为例，怎不叫人惊心呢！”
