Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 24th: Reports from various sources: The despicable crime of the Japanese reactionaries in attempting to assassinate Tokuda Kyuichi, leader of the Japanese Communist Party, has aroused a storm of righteous indignation both inside and outside Japan. The labor unions in northern Kyushu, Japan, decided on the 20th to hold a one-hour general protest strike, declaring that the Ashida government should be held responsible for this crime. Major factories in the Tokyo and Osaka areas have organized protest rallies. Malenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on the 20th, stating: "The Central Committee of the CPSU is deeply indignant at the despicable accomplices of the enemies of the Japanese people for attempting to assassinate our comrade Tokuda—an outstanding leader of the Japanese working class. The Central Committee of the CPSU hereby expresses its deep sympathy to the Central Committee of the JCP, and hopes that Comrade Tokuda will quickly resume his fruitful activities for building a democratic and peace-loving new Japan." The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "L'Unità" pointed out that this new crime was also instigated by American imperialism and stated: In Japan, just as in Italy, the instigators of war are trying to eliminate democratic forces in order to drag these countries into war. However, the counterattack they have encountered in Italy and will encounter in Japan will certainly be a serious warning to them.

　　日本九州北部工人决定总罢工
  　抗议反动派谋刺德田
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方报导：日本反动派谋刺日共领袖德田球一的卑鄙罪行，已激起日本国内外的义愤的风暴。日本九州北部各职工会，已于二十日决定举行一小时的抗议总罢工，并宣称芦田政府应对这一罪行负责。东京与大坂地区的各大工厂，均已组织了抗议集会。苏联共产党中央委员会书记马林科夫二十日致电日本共产党中央委员会称：”联共中央对日本人民的敌人可鄙的走卒谋刺我们的德田同志——日本工人阶级杰出的领袖——甚为愤慨。联共中央兹向日共中央表示深切的同情，并望德田同志将迅速恢复他的为建设民主的爱好和平的新日本而进行的有成果的活动。”意共机关报“团结报”于是重指出这一新罪行同样是由美帝国主义策动后称：在日本，正象在意大利一样，战争的煽动者正在试图纹杀民主力量，以便将这些国家卷入战争。然而，他们在意大利所已遭遇的和将在日本遭遇的反击，对他们一定会是一个严重的警告。
