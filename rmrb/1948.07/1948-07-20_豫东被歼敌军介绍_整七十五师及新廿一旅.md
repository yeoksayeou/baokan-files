　　Introduction to Enemy Troops Annihilated in Eastern Henan
    The 75th Reorganized Division and the New 21st Brigade
    Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, 16th: The following is an introduction to the Chiang army's 75th Reorganized Division and the New 21st Brigade, which were completely annihilated in the Sui-Qi Campaign in Eastern Henan: (1) Before reorganization, the 75th Division was the 75th Army, with Zhou ＠ as the first army commander. It had three divisions: the 6th Division, the 13th Division, and the Provisional 4th Division. Later, the 13th Division was exchanged with the 16th Division and belonged to the Sixth War Area under Chen Cheng. In 1943, Liu Jimin served as the army commander, and Shen Chengnian and Wang Zhongzhu served as deputy army commanders. In October 1944, it was reorganized into two divisions, and the Provisional 4th Division was reorganized into a brigade. After Japan's surrender, it was transferred to the Anlu and Yingshan areas to besiege our Central Plains Military Region. After the failure, Liu Jimin was dismissed, and Shen Chengnian was promoted to army commander. In July 1946, it was reorganized into a division, still led by Shen as the division commander, with the 6th Brigade and the 16th Brigade, totaling four regiments. In October 1947, in the Battle of Northern Bo (County), most of its 16th Brigade was annihilated by the Liu-Deng army. After reorganization and the supplementation of a large number of new recruits, each brigade was restored to a three-regiment system (the 6th Brigade had the 16th, 17th, and 18th Regiments, and the 16th Brigade had the 46th, 47th, and 48th Regiments). It frequently collaborated with Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Army to invade our liberated areas of Southwestern Shandong, East China, and Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu. Later, it was under the command of the 5th Army. Recently, it formed the 7th Army Corps with the 72nd Reorganized Division and the New 21st Brigade. The commander of this army corps was concurrently held by Qu Shounian, the deputy commander of the Sixth Pacification Zone, who was captured this time. (2) The New 21st Brigade was originally the New 21st Division of the Sichuan Army. In 1946, it was reorganized into a brigade, with the 61st and 63rd Regiments under its command, and belonged to the 88th Division. In the Battle of Yutai and Jinxiang last year, our Liu-Deng army completely annihilated its 63rd Regiment. Later, it was supplemented by two battalions of new recruits from the local security forces and changed its designation to the 147th Brigade. In mid-April of this year, the 88th Division was reorganized into a garrison division, and the New 21st Brigade was changed to an independent brigade, placed under the command of the 75th Division, and restored to a three-regiment system, with the 61st, 62nd, and 63rd Regiments under its command.
