Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Four hundred and thirty-seven professors and lecturers from various universities in Peking jointly sent a letter to U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, on June 8th, sternly refuting Stuart's statement made on June 4th. Among the declarations repeatedly issued by Peking professors in recent years, this is the one with the largest number of signatories. The full text of the letter, as published in the Tianjin Daily on June 13th, is as follows:

Mr. Stuart,

The facts are evident that your government has violated the Potsdam Agreement and has done everything possible to support Japanese militarism. Yet you preposterously claimed: "I don't think anyone can present any evidence that any part of Japan's military strength is now being restored." Facts in the world cannot be hidden by lies. As the U.S. Ambassador, you should be more aware than us of your government's conspiracies and actions, yet you resort to such lies and deception. Wouldn't this "damage" your "position and reputation"? To dispel your smokescreen, we hereby briefly describe the facts of your government's malicious support for Japan and its restoration of militarism as follows:

(1) In terms of the Army: Allowing its police force to expand from 61,000 in 1932 to 300,000, equivalent to the total number of its pre-war regular army and police. Also, allowing it to "train special emergency forces" is equivalent to training a regular army.

(2) In terms of the Navy: Returning 28 ships, including destroyers and submarines, and allowing it to establish a "Maritime Safety Agency." This agency commands 38 patrol ships, and will later expand to 135, and it is even allowed to possess 100 minesweepers. Its largest naval ports, Sasebo, Yokosuka, and Kure, have not only not been dismantled but are being actively expanded with American equipment.

(3) In terms of the Air Force: Retaining its airfields and air defense facilities in various locations, as well as 45 Nakajima aircraft factories, further adding a "strong air force base" in Aomori Zenguan, and transporting former Kamikaze pilots to the United States for training.

(4) In terms of Politics: Retaining the war criminal Emperor, condoning war criminals such as Tojo, Doihara, Matsui Iwane, etc., releasing fascist leaders such as Army General Masaki Jinzaburo, former Taiwan Governor Navy General Kobayashi Seizo, and aircraft tycoon Nakajima Chikuhei and other dozens of major criminals; commanders of the China Expeditionary Army, Okamura Neiji, Commander of the China Sea Fleet, Hasegawa Kiyoshi and other thousands of war criminals have not been arrested and brought to justice. It also strongly encourages their past acts of harming overseas Chinese and oppressing Koreans, and vigorously suppresses the rise of the people's power, hoping that all the Japanese people will forever be mired in feudal fascist tyranny.

(5) In terms of Economy: Allowing it to increase annual steel production to 8.5 million tons, retaining 4 million tons of merchant ships, an annual shipbuilding capacity of 400,000 tons, and restoring spindles to 10 million, while all hydroelectric and thermal power are preserved. Other industries such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and soda ash all exceed the 1935 level. The above are all directly or indirectly related to military industries.

The above are just a few prominent examples; other support measures are too numerous to mention. In the face of such facts, can you still assert that "no one can present any evidence that the United States has any agreement other than that Japan's military power will never rise again"? You stated: "The basis of Japanese aggression lies in its imperial territories outside its homeland." This kind of upside-down cause-and-effect fallacy is extremely foolish. May I ask, if there is no prior aggression, where does the "imperial territory outside the homeland" come from? After Japan restores its situation before the "July 7th" Incident, it can invade externally at any time. China and Japan are so close to each other. Can we "rest assured" as you said? Your government is using "anti-communism" and "anti-Soviet" to support Japanese militarism, allowing it to make a comeback. Before World War II, Japanese warlords and German and Italian fascists also used the excuse of "anti-communism" and "anti-Soviet" to develop industry and expand armaments. However, were the first to suffer communism and the Soviet Union, or China and Western European countries? This is only the current historical lesson, how can you be so forgetful?

Japan's economy must be "restored" to the "extent that it can be self-sufficient," and we certainly agree with this. However, your government allows it to "restore" to the 1935 level, which far exceeds the "extent that it can be self-sufficient" and can be used for large-scale aggression. Can you "deny" its threat to China? If you want to improve the living standards of the Japanese people and enable them to have sufficient food and clothing, you should implement land reform and a rational distribution system in Japan, and not use China as a colony to supply raw materials and sell commodities.

You have always claimed to "help improve the happiness of Chinese students." However, your written statement on June 4th insulted and threatened the anti-support-Japan movement of Chinese students, making the Chinese people understand your true face. Thinking for you, this is really unwise. Your government's actions to support Japan are directly related to the survival of our nation and world peace. Therefore, the opposition of Chinese students represents the interests of all Chinese people, and their voices represent the voices of the Chinese people. Your slanderous accusations of "voluntarily being used" and "other conspiracies" are truly out of character. Is it that the Chinese people must all bow their heads and obey your government's support of Japanese militarism and the carving up of China in order to obtain the "reputation" of not being "used"? You have "spent most of your life in Chinese academic circles," yet you are so blind and ignorant of the real situation in China. We deeply sigh for you. You defend your government's wrong policies, forcefully argue, and conceal the facts, causing the Chinese people to hate you deeply. During World War II, your country fought alongside China for the common interests of both countries, defeating the common enemy of both countries. How ridiculous is it that your government lords over the Chinese people in the posture of a benefactor? After Japan's surrender, your government claimed to "assist China in its tragic circumstances," but the Chinese people have not received your government's "assistance." On the contrary, precisely because your government interfered in China's internal affairs and maliciously "assisted," it has prolonged and expanded the Chinese civil war, causing the Chinese people to suffer greatly. "You must be prepared to bear the consequences of your actions." The Chinese students, intellectuals, and all the people do not care about this unreasonable threat, because your government's aggressive claws have already reached into China, and we have already learned from it. We firmly believe that the strength of the Chinese people is enough to defeat any foreign interference and oppression. We firmly believe that the vast majority of good people in your country must also stand on the same front with the Chinese people to defeat your government's reactionary policies. If your government does not immediately change its government's policy of continuing to support Japanese militarism, we should tell you in your own words: Your government "must be prepared to bear the consequences of its actions"!

### 北平四百余教授致函司徒　严斥美国扶植日本  中国人民有力量击溃任何外来压迫

　　北平四百余教授致函司徒
    严斥美国扶植日本
    中国人民有力量击溃任何外来压迫
    【新华社陕北二日电】北平各大学教授讲师四百三十七人曾于六月八日联名致函美国驻华大使司徒雷登，对司徒六月四日发表的声明，予以严正驳斥。在北平教授近年迭次发表的宣言中，这是署名人数最多的一次。据六月十三日津报所载该函全文如下：
    司徒雷登先生大鉴：贵国政府违反波茨顿协议，极尽扶植日本军国主义之能事，事实昭昭在目，而阁下竟妄谓：“余以为无任何人能提出日本军力之任何部分现正予以恢复之证据。”天地间之事实决非谎言所可隐藏，阁下身为美国大使，较吾人当更洞悉贵国政府之阴谋行动，然竟如此撒谎欺骗，岂不“损害”阁下之“地位与名誉”？兹为消除阁下之烟幕，特将贵国政府恶意扶植日本，恢复军国主义之事实略述如后：
    （一）陆军方面：允其警察由一九三二年之六万一千名扩充为三十万名，等于其战前常备陆军及警察之总数。又允其“训练特别非常部队”，等于训练正规陆军。
    （二）海军方面：交还驱逐、潜水等舰二十八艘，允其设立“海上保安厅”。统辖巡视舰三十八艘，以后扩充至一百三十五艘，更允其拥有扫雷艇一百艘。其最大军港佐世保、横须贺及吴港非特未予拆除，且正按美国设备，积极扩充。
    （三）空军方面：保留其各地飞机场与防空设备，以及中岛飞机制造厂四十五所，更于青森增关“强大空军基地”，复运往日之神风队飞行员赴美训练。
    （四）政治方面：保留战争罪魁天皇，姑息战争要犯东条、土肥原、松井石根等，释放法西斯领袖陆军大将真崎堪三郎、前台湾总督海军大将小林跻造及飞机大王中岛知久平等要犯数十名，侵华陆军总司令冈村宁次、侵华海军总司令长谷川清及其他万千战犯即迄未逮捕法办。对其历次伤害华侨及压迫韩人之行为更极力怂恿，对其人民势力之抬头更极力箝制，务希全日人民永远沉沦于封建法西斯苛政之下。
    （五）经济方面：允其提高钢铁年产量至八百五十万吨，保留商船四百万吨，每年造船能力四十万吨，纺锭则恢复至一千万枚，水电、火电则全部保存。其他如硫酸、硝酸、灰碱等工业则皆超过一九三五年水准。以上皆直接或间接属于军需工业。
    上列数端仅为荦荦大者，其他种种扶植措施尚不及备举。面对此种事实，阁下尚可断言“无任何人能提出美国有使日本军力永不再起以外任何同意之证据”乎？阁下有云：“日本侵略之基础系在其本土以外之帝国统治地”，此种因果倒置之谬论，至为愚蠢；试问如不先行侵略，“本土以外之帝国统治地”由何而来？日本恢复“七七”事变前夕之景况后，自可随时对外侵略，中国与日近在咫尺，则吾人尚可如阁下所云“尽可安心”乎？贵国政府借“反共”、“反苏”以扶植日本军国主义，使其东山再起。第二次世界大战前日本军阀与德、意法西斯亦借口“反共”，“反苏”以发展工业，扩充军备，然首遭其殃者果为共产主义与苏联乎，抑为中国与西欧各国乎？此仅为目前之历史教训，阁下何健忘至此？
    日本之经济须“恢复”至“能以自给之程度”，吾人固极赞同，然贵国政府允其“恢复”至一九三五年水准，是则远超“能以自给之程度”，而可大肆侵略矣。其对中国之威胁阁下竟可“余否认之”耶？如欲提高日本生活水准，使其护得丰衣足食，自应在日本国内实行土地改革及合理之分配制度，而不得以中国为供应原料与推销商品之殖民地也。
    阁下素以“协助增进中国学生之幸福”自居，然阁下六月四日之书面声明对中国学生之反扶日运与予以侮辱与威胁，使中国人民洞察阁下之真面目，为阁下思之，实属不智。贵国政府扶日之举直接攸关我民族之存亡与世界之和平，故中国学生之反对，实代表全中国人民之利益，其呼声实代表中国人民之呼声。阁下信口雌黄，诬为“自愿被利用”及“其他阴谋”实乃大失体态。岂中国人民人人府首听从贵国政府扶植日本军国主义宰割中国，即可获得不“被利用”之“名誉”乎？阁下“一生之大部分时间消磨于中国学术界中”，而竟对中国实情如此盲昧无知，吾人深为阁下叹息。阁下为贵国政府之错误政策辩护，强辞夺理，掩饰事实，使中国人民痛恨不置。第二次大战期间，贵国与中国并肩作战，乃为两国之共同利益，击败两国之共同敌人。贵国政府如以恩人之姿态君临中国人民，岂不可笑？日本投降后，贵国政府自命“协助陷于悲惨环境中之中国”，然中国人民并未获得贵国政府之“协助”与此相反，正因贵国政府干涉中国内政，恶意“协助”，已使中国内战拖延扩大，已使中国人民生灵涂炭。“诸君必须准备承受行动之结果”。阁下此种无理威胁。中国学生与知识分子以及全体人民绝不介意，盖贵国政府之侵略魔爪早已伸入中国，吾人已领教有素矣。吾人深信中国人民之力量足以击溃任何外来之干涉与压迫，吾人深信贵国绝大多数善良人民亦必与中国人民立于一条战线上，击溃贵国政府之反动政策。贵国政府若不立即改变其继续扶植日本军国主义之政府，吾人当以阁下之言转告阁下，曰：贵国政府“必须准备承受行动之结果”！
