　　The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee jointly issued urgent instructions to the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office, emphasizing the need to pay serious attention to the struggle against the disaster. Excerpt: Hebei region has not yet received a thorough rain, sowing has not been completed, and seedlings are about to die from drought. In addition to agreeing with the Administrative Office's work arrangements for governments at all levels, in order to more effectively overcome the disaster, forces should be organized to implement the following: (1) Mobilize the masses to sow and protect seedlings, and actively prepare seeds for early-maturing, short-term crops, such as buckwheat and vegetables, for replanting after late rains. (2) When mobilizing the masses, extensively involve all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women, as well as animal power. In areas with a foundation and conditions, organize mutual aid teams, rationally dividing labor based on labor conditions, to maximize effectiveness. (3) In the sowing, seedling protection, and drought resistance movement, pay attention to the creation of mass experience, and mobilize the masses to create experience, promptly exchange experiences, and learn from each other, to quickly extinguish the disaster.
    [Taihang News] Since the beginning of summer, many places in Taihang have not had rain for a long time, and the crops in the fields are showing signs of drought. Especially in the areas along the Pinghan Railway, crops such as millet and Chinese yam are either withering with rolled leaves or already yellow leaves. In some areas, sowing has not yet started after the wheat harvest due to drought. In Baidi, Huixian County, there are 70,000 mu, in Linxian County, there are 30,000 mu, and in Dong'anju Village, Shexian County, out of more than 1,800 mu of wheat fields, only more than 100 mu have been sown after harvesting, and the rest have not been sown. The Taihang Administrative Office recently telegraphed the First, Fifth, and Sixth Administrative Offices, urging them to closely monitor the development of the drought situation and immediately organize the masses to plant and water seedlings. The Shexian and Neiqiu County Committees of the Communist Party of China successively issued emergency calls at the beginning of this month, urging all cadres, party members, and the masses to immediately take action to fully protect seedlings, plant seeds, and fight against the drought. It was pointed out that Communist Party members must immediately lead and organize the masses to break the farmers' wait-and-see mentality, recall and summarize the experience of drought resistance and famine preparedness in previous years, build and restore canals, and use wells and cellars to plant. On the south bank of the Zhang River, the masses should be organized to irrigate the land and protect the seedlings. Dry land should be hoed more, and small seedlings should be covered with branches. And organize the masses to save and prepare for famine, collect wild vegetables, and promote careful use of water. Every village and household must formulate a production and savings plan. According to different regions, give play to the role of cooperatives, organize the masses to engage in various sideline productions, earn money to buy bran and grain, purchase seeds of early-maturing crops, and prepare to replant late crops.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会指示冀鲁豫
    组织力量战胜灾荒
    太行各地积极抗旱备荒
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府与晋察冀边区行政委员会联合紧急指示冀鲁豫行署，严重注视和灾害斗争。略称：河北地区现在尚未落过透雨，播种尚未完成，小苗亦将旱死。除同意行署对各级政府之工作布置外，为了更有效的战胜灾荒，应该组织力量，加以贯彻：（一）发动群众播种保苗，并积极准备早熟短期作物，如荞麦、蔬菜等种子，以便在晚雨之后，进行补种。（二）发动群众时要广泛的把男女全半劳力及畜力都卷入运动。在有基础有条件地区，可组织变工互助，依据劳力情况合理分工，以发挥更大效能。（三）在播种保苗抗旱运动中，要注意群众经验的创造，并发动群众创造经验，及时的交流经验，互相学习，以便迅速扑灭灾荒。
    【太行讯】太行很多地方入夏以来久未落雨之，田禾已呈旱象。特别是平汉沿线地区，谷子、山药等作物有的旱得卷了叶，有的叶子已经黄了。部分地区麦收后因天旱尚未下种。辉县白地有七万亩，林县有三万亩，涉县东安居全村一千八百多亩麦地，收割后除一百多亩下种外，其余都未下种。太行行署于日前电告一、五、六专署，严密注视旱象的发展，立即组织群众点种浇苗，中共涉县、内邱县委于本月初先后紧急号召所有干部党员群众，立即行动起来，全力保苗点种，向天旱作斗争。指出共产党员必须立即带领与组织群众打破农民等待思想，回忆总结历年抗旱备荒经验，开筑与恢复水渠，利用水井、水窑点种。尚河南岸要组织群众浇地保苗。旱地要多锄，用树枝遮盖小苗。并组织群众节约备荒，采集野菜，提倡细水长流。村村户户要订出生产节约计划。按照不同地区，发挥合作社作用，组织群众各种副业生产，赚钱买糠买粮，购买早熟作物的种子，准备补种晚庄稼。
