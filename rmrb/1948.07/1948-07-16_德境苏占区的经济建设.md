　　Despite the fact that the Soviet Zone of Germany suffered far greater war damage than the western occupation zones, and the restoration of industry and agriculture faced serious difficulties, the current level of industrial production in the area has reached 56.9 percent of the 1936 level. At the end of last year, coal production was 90 percent of pre-war levels; in 1947, the agricultural cultivated area increased to 94 percent of 1938 levels. On the other hand, the industrial production level in the Western Allied occupation zones of Germany is only 38.6 percent of the pre-war level. Coal production in the Ruhr is 50 to 60 percent of pre-war levels; agricultural cultivated area is 50 percent of pre-war levels.

　　The economic achievements of the Soviet occupation zone are primarily due to the cleansing of Nazi elements from all administrative institutions with the help of the Soviet military government, replaced by democratic elements. Now, the economic restoration work in eastern Germany is guided by people's representatives, anti-fascists, and democratic people. For example, Müller, a former metal worker from Chemnitz who was imprisoned in concentration camps for many years, is now the mayor of the city. Ligel, a former prisoner of the Buchenwald concentration camp and a printing worker, is now the police chief of the city.

　　The nationalization of industry has brought fundamental changes to the economy of the Soviet occupation zone. According to official figures released, at the end of 1947, the percentages of nationalized industries in the Soviet occupation zone were: mining 97.3 percent, metallurgical industry 52.7 percent, power industry 60 percent, and machinery manufacturing 42.5 percent. Three thousand enterprises that have been nationalized exceeded the total production plan by 9 percent last year, surpassing private enterprises.

　　The Soviet military government provides constant assistance to enterprises in its occupation zone. In this regard, Marshal Sokolovsky's order on "methods to increase labor productivity and further improve the material conditions of workers in industry and transportation" played an important role. The democratic newspapers praised this order as "a program for labor to overcome poverty and chaos." Industrial workers in the Soviet occupation zone receive extra hot meals, paid vacation wages, and consumer goods. Marshal Sokolovsky also issued a special order restricting the working hours of young people. Equal pay for equal work for men and women is also expressly stipulated.

　　The land reform implemented in the Soviet occupation zone also has a very important impact. As a result of the liquidation of landlord estates, the number of farms owning 5 to 20 hectares (16 Chinese acres per hectare) has doubled. The peasant mutual aid committees generated during the land reform process are carrying out the basic work of democratizing the German countryside. Seventy percent of the farmers in eastern Germany participate in these committees. The peasant mutual aid committees hold about 4,000 machine and tractor stations, 2,000 repair shops, and 4,800 agricultural raw material processing enterprises.

　　People's Control Committees play a significant organizational role in various economic sectors of the Soviet occupation zone. The People's Control Committees are composed of representatives of the working people's democratic strata, who supervise the correct use of raw materials, production, and distribution. In the province of Thuringia, there are 700 such committees. Last year, they confiscated goods worth 8 million marks that had been hoarded through speculation and concealment.

### 德境苏占区的经济建设

　　德境苏占区的经济建设
    尽管德境苏占区的战争损害远较西部占领区为大，工农业之复原有着严重的困难，但是，该区现在的工业生产水平已达一九三六年水平的百分之五十六点九。去年年底，煤的生产为战前产量的百分之九十；一九四七年内，农业耕种面积提高到一九三八年的百分之九十四。另一方面，西德联合占领区的工业生产水平，却只有战前水平的百分之三十八点六。鲁尔的煤产为战前水平的百分之五十至六十；农业耕种面积为战前水平的百分之五十。
    苏联占领区的经济成就，首先是由于在苏联军政府帮助下，将纳粹分子清洗出一切行政机构，而代以民主分子的结果。现在，德国东部的经济复原工作，是由人民的代表，反法西斯与民主人士来指导的。例如开姆尼斯以前的金属工人缪勒，曾被监禁在集中营中多年，现在，他已成为该市的市长。前布根威尔集中营的囚徒、印刷工人李格尔，现在是该市的警察局长。
    工业的国有化给苏联占领区的经济带来了根本的变化。根据已发表的官方数字，一九四七年底苏占领区实行了国有化的工业：矿业为全部的百分之九十七点三；冶金工业为百分之五十二点七；动力工业为百分之六十；机器制造业为百分之四十二点五。三千个已经国有化了的企业，去年超过总生产计划百分之九，驾凌于私营企业之上。
    苏联军政府给予其占领区内的企业以经常的帮助。在这一方面，索柯洛夫斯基元帅“增加劳动生产力及进一步改善工业与运输业职工物质条件办法”的命令，起了重要的作用。民主报纸称颂这一命令为“劳工战胜贫困与紊乱的纲领”。苏联占领区的产业工人有额外的热食，假期工资照付，还得到消费品的供给。索柯洛夫斯基元帅又颁布特别命令，限制青年人的工作时间。男女同工同酬也明令规定。
    苏联占领区所贯彻的土地改革，也有很重要的影响。由于清算了地主庄园的结果，拥有五公顷至二十公顷（每公顷合十六华亩）之农庄的数目，已经增加一倍。在土地改革过程中产生的农民互助委员会，正进行德国乡村民主化的基本工作。德国东部的农民，百分之七十参加了这种委员会。农民互助委员会握有约四千所机器与拖拉机站、二千所修理厂、四千八百个农业原料加工企业。
    人民管制委员会在苏占区各经济部门中起了重大的组织作用。人民管制委员会由劳动人民民主阶层的代表组成，他们监督原料的正确使用，生产与分配。在绍林吉亚省，就有七百个这种委员会。它们在去年没收了用投机与隐藏等手段而囤积起来的货物，价值八百万马克。（摘自苏联劳动报）
