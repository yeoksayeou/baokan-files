[Jizhong News] The Jizhong Eighth Sub-district issued a large number of loans to support mass agricultural and sideline production. As of the end of May, a total of 4,066,600,000 yuan (border currency, same below) had been loaned, driving 813,300,000 yuan in private capital. Among them, agricultural loans amounted to 2,190,000,000 yuan, sideline loans amounted to 1,089,000,000 yuan, and water conservancy loans amounted to 884,000,000 yuan. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Jinghai, Qingcangjiao, Wenxin, Dacheng, Renhe, Jiaohe, and Qingxian: the masses used loans combined with private capital to purchase 289 head of livestock. In Qingcangjiao, 55 poor peasant households and 2 middle peasant households in ten villages used 34,400,000 yuan in loans, driving 4,500,000 yuan in private capital, and bought 22 head of livestock, solving the difficulties of spring plowing and sowing for them and others. Wenxin purchased livestock through loans to rush plant waterlogged land, and the urban area rushed to plant 6,061 mu in eight days. Wenxin and Jinghai counties are close to the Wen'an Depression and often suffer from floods, making them relatively poor. The government issued more than 420 million yuan in loans to support the masses in building 29,644 rice ponds, which can grow 73,000 mu of rice, enabling 4,456 poor peasant households and 678 middle peasant households to plant an average of 7 mu of rice per household. Loans supported the rush planting of spring wheat in 31 villages, lending to 5,130 households, enabling each household to plant an average of 24 mu of spring wheat. The masses in the Eighth Sub-district were not accustomed to building wells. After repeated publicity, explanation, and key demonstrations, the masses' concerns were gradually broken. According to statistics from eight counties including Hejian, Xianjiao, Renqiu, and Renhe: 102 wells have been completed, and 106 are under construction or will be started. Seventy-seven villages in Qingxian alone dug 1,154 earthen wells. In order to solve the difficulty of using bricks for well construction, loans supported the establishment of 16 brick kilns, laying a solid foundation for the development of water conservancy in the Eighth Sub-district. Many villages in Jinghai suffered from enemy and water disasters, and the masses' lives were very difficult. Loans of 36,475,000 yuan, driving 4,500,000 yuan in private capital, organized the masses to restore mat weaving. Each person can weave two or three mats a day, and each mat can earn several thousand yuan. The lives of most poor peasants in about twenty villages have been resolved, improving everyone's production enthusiasm. Ren Pang Linhe Village was very poor. Using a loan of 13 million yuan, it organized 108 households to spin and weave. When the accounts were settled after a month, the entire village earned a total of 29,760,000 yuan from weaving, and the production efficiency exceeded the previous three-fifths. The above figures show that the loan work in the Eighth Sub-district has made great achievements, but on the other hand, there are still the following main shortcomings: In some places, loans rely solely on village cadres and poor peasant associations. They are granted loans based on their introduction letters without in-depth investigation and mobilizing the masses. Tai Yancheng and Song Tiande, representatives of Qianchang in the Sixth District before the founding of the country, borrowed 10,030,000 yuan themselves, and no one else knew about it. At the same time, there is a lack of a clear production perspective. In the issuance of loans in various counties, there is still a phenomenon of only issuing loans without organizing production, and there is also a lack of production education for the masses. Some people do not engage in production after receiving loans and waste them. Some places simply follow the "poor and hired peasant line", and in the issuance, regardless of whether there are production conditions, they lend to poor and hired peasants, ignoring helping middle peasants in production. In terms of leadership, some places lack in-depth inspection and research, and problems cannot be corrected in time, and experiences and lessons cannot be summarized and promoted in time.
    In the future, when issuing loans, we must establish a long-term construction thinking, and everything must start from restoring and developing production. We must vigorously develop water conservancy and issue water conservancy loans in a planned and focused manner. In terms of methods, we should mobilize the masses, self-report and publicly discuss, and organize the masses through loans. In terms of loan recipients, loans should be given to hardworking farmers and other people in need according to production needs, but the difficulties of poor and hired peasants should be taken care of first. Strengthen inspection work, start from organizing production, widely carry out production education, adopt democratic methods, exchange experiences, establish models, educate the backward, and further improve production work.

　　冀中八分区
    发放贷款四十亿
    扶助群众农副业生产
    【冀中讯】冀中八分区发放大批贷款，扶助群众农副业生产，截至五月底，共贷出四十万万六千六百余万元（边币，下同），并带动私资八万万一千三百余万元。其中农业贷款二十一万万九千余万元，副业贷款十万万八千九百余万元，水利贷款八万万八千四百余万元。根据静海、青沧交、文新、大城、任河、交河、青县等七个县的不完整统计：群众利用贷款结合私资，已经买到牲口二百八十九头。青沧交十个村五十五户贫农，两户中农，用贷款三千四百四十万元，带动私资四百五十万元，买牲口二十二头，解决了他们及另外一些人春耕播种的困难。文新通过贷款购买牲口，抢种水脱地，城厢区八天中抢种六千零六十一亩。文新、静海两县靠近文安洼，常年受水灾，比较贫苦，政府发放贷款四万万二千多万元，扶植群众打稻池子二万九千六百四十四个，能种稻子七万三千亩，使四千四百五十六户贫农，六百七十八户中农，平均每户能种上七亩稻子。贷款扶植了三十一个村的春麦抢种，贷给五千一百三十户，使每户平均能种上二十四亩春麦。八分区群众不习惯造井，经过反复宣传解释和重点示范，逐渐打破了群众的顾虑。据河间、献交、任邱、任河等八个县的统计：已打成水井一百零二眼，已动工和将动工的有一百零六眼。青县七十七个村就打了一千一百五十四眼土井。为了解决扶井用砖的困难，贷款百植了十六座砖窑，对八分区开展水利，打下了有力的基础。静海有不少村庄遭受敌灾水灾，群众生活非常困难。贷款三千六百四十七万五千元，带动私资四百五十万元，组织群众恢复席业，每天一人能织两三领席，一领席能赚几千元。二十来个村庄大部分贫农的生活得到了解决，提高了大家的生产情绪。任庞临河村很穷，用贷款一千三百万元，组织了一百零八户纺织，一个月结帐时，全村织布共赚二千九百七十六万元，生产效率超过以往五分之三。以上数字说明八分区的贷款工作有很大成绩，但在另一方面，还存在着以下几个主要缺点：有些地方贷款时光依靠村干部和贫农团，看到他们的介绍信就贷给，不去深入调查和发动群众，建国六区前厂代表台彦成、宋天德等自己贷款一千零三十万元，别人都不知道。同时缺乏明确的生产观点，在各县发放贷款中还存在着只管发放，不管组织生产的现象，对群众也缺乏生产教育。有些人贷到款不去生产，浪费掉了。有些地方单纯的走“贫雇农路线”，在发放时不管是不是有生产条件，只要是贫雇农就贷，忽视了帮助中农生产。在领导上有些地方缺乏深入的检查研究，有了毛病不能及时纠正，经验教训不能及时总结推广。
    今后发放贷款，必须树立长期的建设思想，一切从恢复和发展生产出发。必须大力开展水利，有计划有重点的发放水利贷款。在方式上应该发动群众，自报公议，通过贷款把群众组织起来。在贷款对象上，应按照生产需要，贷给劳苦农民及其他需要的人民，但首先应照顾贫雇农的困难。加强检查工作，从组织生产着手，广泛进行生产教育，采取民主方式，交流经验，树立模范，教育落后，把生产工作再提高一步。
