[Hebei-Central News] Deep County Party Committee, after inspection, found serious chaos in the rear wartime support work and proposed four improvement measures. In Fengjiaying Village, First District, over six months, there were more than 2,900 labor days for wartime support. After inspection, only more than 230 were reasonably mobilized, with illegal mobilization accounting for over 90% of the total. In Yuantou, Fourth District, when a civilian laborer performed wartime service, the village assigned him a large ox to plow the land, only plowing seven fen (a unit of area) a day, and also provided three meals, wasting manpower and resources. The provision of labor and the implementation of the "Qi Gong" (equal labor) system in many villages were unreasonable. Some households were sent four or five times a month, while others were never sent at all. In many villages, the burden of service was too narrow, and the exemption from service was too broad. In Daliu Village, Fourth District, all seventy or so village cadres were exempt from wartime service. Some masses, due to excessive wartime service, even exchanged good livestock for bad ones, and some simply sold them. The reasons for these chaotic and unreasonable phenomena are mainly that cadres did not pay attention to this work, there was no dedicated person in charge, and some even wanted to find advantages for themselves, allowing some people to exploit loopholes. In order to correct these chaotic phenomena and improve the wartime support burden, the County Party Committee has put forward four measures: (1) Expand the scope of service: All people of eligible age for service (except those exempted by the government) shall bear the rear service tasks in a reasonable manner. (2) Mobilize the masses to discuss democratically, determine grades, and bear wartime service, and establish a method for calculating work and achieving equal labor. If there is excessive or insufficient service, labor can be repaid with production or in-kind. (3) Strictly prohibit illegal mobilization of manpower and animal power. (4) Strengthen the leadership of wartime service work, establish a reporting system, and solve problems in a timely manner.

　　深县战勤工作混乱
    县委提出改进办法
    【冀中讯】深县县委检查出后方战勤工作存在着严重的混乱现象，提出四项改进办法。一区冯家营村六个月出勤工二千九百多个，经过检查，其中合理动员出只有二百三十多个，非法动员的占总数的百分之九十强。四区院头一个民工出了战勤，村里给他派了一个大牛耕地，一天只耕七分，还管了三顿饭，浪费了人力物力。许多村庄出工、齐工不够合理，有的一户一月出四、五次，有的户一次没出过。不少村庄勤务负担面太窄，免勤面太宽。四区大流村七十多个村干部一律不出勤务。有些群众因出勤过多，竟把好牲口换成坏的，有的干脆卖了。造成这些混乱与不合理现象的原因，主要是干部没有重视这个工作，没有专人掌握，甚至自己也想找便宜，使某些人钻了空子。县委为了纠正这些混乱现象，改进战勤负担，特提出四项办法：（一）扩大出勤面：凡够出勤年龄的人（政府规定免勤者除外），一律按合理的办法负担后勤任务。（二）发动群众民主讨论，定出等级，负担战勤、建立计工齐工办法。如有出勤过多过少的，可用生产还工或实物还工。（三）严格禁止非法动员人力畜力。（四）加强勤务工作的领导，树立汇报制度，发现问题及时解决。
