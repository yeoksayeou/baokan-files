Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 30th: During the Kaifeng campaign, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army strictly implemented city policies and observed discipline. The day before the battle began, the unit convened cadres at all levels to convey in detail the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Front Headquarters and Political Department regarding the protection of the city and the strict observance of city discipline. The day after entering Kaifeng's city walls, the unit and its divisions and regiments organized discipline inspection teams, with the director of the unit's political department and the minister of civil affairs personally serving as the captain and deputy captain of the inspection teams. During the five days and nights of fighting, political organs at all levels continuously conducted inspections and mobilizations. On the evening of the 15th, when the unit attacked the Agricultural College of Henan University, which had been set on fire by fleeing enemies, it immediately dispatched specialized troops to rescue buildings, books, and instruments. On the 18th, a part of the unit rested at the agricultural and forestry experimental farm. Although the soldiers had not eaten for a night, no one picked the ripe peaches and apricots in the orchard. On the 20th, after the unit occupied Zhongshan Street, Gulou Street, and other places through fierce street fighting, it deployed discipline inspection personnel everywhere and continued to carry out their tasks despite the frantic bombing by Chiang's planes. In front of all public buildings, cultural and educational institutions, and churches, signs were posted stating that our army strictly protects these institutions. When a group of poor citizens, who had been short of salt, rushed into a salt shop on Ziyou Road to take salt, the unit's discipline inspection personnel immediately went to dissuade them. The shop was extremely grateful and voluntarily sold a portion of its remaining salt at a low price, which satisfied both buyers and sellers. The unit immediately corrected any errors found during inspections. For example, when the unit's supply department mistakenly requisitioned 80 jin of wheat from the Yuxing Grain Shop, which was across from an enemy warehouse, it immediately compensated the shop after the mistake was discovered. Also, when a certain division searched for enemy supplies, it mistakenly confiscated some private belongings of the enemy officers' families. After investigation, it immediately sent special personnel to return the original items to their original owners. After the battle, the unit quickly carried out post-war rectification work to resolve incidents of damage to the interests of the masses that occurred during the war. The party committee of a certain unit also pointed out: "If post-war work is not done well, it means that the city policies and discipline have not been done well."

　　开封我军执行城市政策
    纪律严明满园桃杏无人摘食
    轰炸声中抢救文物保护机关
    【新华社开封前线三十日电】解放军某部在开封战役中，严格执行城市政策与遵守纪律，战斗开始前一日，该部即召集各级干部，详细的传达了中共中央与前线司令部、政治部关于保护城市的各项政策及严格遵守城市纪律的指示。攻入开封城厢之次日，该部及各师、团则组织纠察队，并由该部政治部主任，民运部长亲任纠察队正副队长。在五昼夜战斗中，各级政治机关均不断进行检查与动员。十五日晚，该部攻进先被溃敌纵火焚烧之河南大学农学院时，立即派出专门部队，抢救房屋及图书仪器。十八日，该部一部曾在农林试验场休息，战士们虽已一夜未进饮食，但对满园已熟的桃杏却无人摘取。二十日，该部经激烈巷战占领中山街、鼓楼街等处后，即遍布纠察队员，虽在蒋机疯狂轰炸下，仍继续执行任务。各公共建筑物、各文化教育机关及教堂前均张贴我军严格保护此等机关的牌示。自由路某一盐店被一群已缺盐数目的贫苦市民涌入取盐，部队纠察人员即前往劝止；店方极为感激，自动廉价售出一部分存盐，故买卖双方均感满意。该部在检查中遇有错误即时纠正。如该部供给部误征敌军仓库对门之豫兴粮栈八十斤麦子，经发觉后立予偿还。又某师在搜查敌军物资时，曾误将敌军军官家属一部分私物没收，经查明后亦即派专人将原物归还原主。战斗结束后，该部迅即进行善后整顿工作，解决在战争过程中所发生损害群众利益的事件。某部党委并指出：“善后工作如未作好，就是城市政策和纪律没有做好。”
