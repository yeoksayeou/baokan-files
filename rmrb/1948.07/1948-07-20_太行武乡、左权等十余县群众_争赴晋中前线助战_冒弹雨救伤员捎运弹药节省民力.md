[Taihang Electric] The masses in more than ten counties in the first and second districts of Taihang are heroically and enthusiastically helping the Jinzhong People's Liberation Army in the battle. The number of civilian laborers participating in the war from Wuxiang and Zuoquan counties alone reached 25,000. At the July 1st commemorative meeting in Chengnan Street, Zanhuang, cadres, militiamen, and the masses eagerly signed up to go to the Jinzhong front to participate in the war. Li Kezhi, the leader of the fourth squad of the second battalion of the Wuxiang stretcher team, led his stretcher bearers and, in the battle of Baishen Village, braved the intense strafing of enemy aircraft. Everyone was exceptionally calm and rescued the wounded in a very orderly manner. Battalion Commander Li Youtang and communication soldier Zhang Bohai looked after the wounded all day, feeding them soup and rice. Team member Hao Caiming took out 1,000 yuan (Jicha) to buy eggs for the wounded. Li Wentang, a member of the third squad of the first battalion, braved the rain of bullets on the battlefield to rescue an injured instructor, carrying him to a safe area three miles away. Wang Wenxiu, the leader of the fourth squad of the second battalion of the Zuoquan stretcher team, personally led a platoon back and forth on the front line in the battle of Dongxilang Village, rescuing many wounded soldiers. The troops awarded them fifteen catties of white flour and two packs of cigarettes. War participation model Li Erniu covered the wounded with his own quilt. The civilian laborers accompanying the army from Xiangyuan, Heshun, and Yushe completed the task of transporting the wounded seventy or eighty miles in one go, regardless of fatigue. Cadres of a certain battalion of the Wuxiang Transportation Team took the lead in launching a mutual aid movement, overcoming mountains and valleys, and successfully completed the transportation of grain overnight. The second battalion of the Zuoquan accompanying army stretcher team, in order to save civilian labor, transported ammunition for more than a hundred miles, with an average of four people completing the tasks of five. While civilian laborers accompanying a certain column were transporting ammunition, they encountered rain. The civilian laborers took off their clothes and straw hats to cover the ammunition, ensuring that the ammunition was not damaged in the slightest. Han Zhigui, the leader of the fifth squad of the second battalion of the Wuxiang Transportation Team, and the deputy leader of the sixth squad remained calm and delivered bullets to the soldiers during the intense battle. Li Ergui delivered boxes of artillery shells to the artillerymen until the final victory of the battle. Civilian laborers implemented merit recording and evaluation. The fifth squad of the second battalion of the Wuxiang stretcher team recently conducted a summary. All 169 members of the squad rescued and transported the wounded day and night, without a single person slacking off or running away, and thirty-two models emerged.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 15th: "If we eliminate Yan Xishan, everything will be ours; if we don't eliminate Yan Xishan, everything will be Yan Xishan's." This is the slogan of the people of Jinzhong who have regained liberation to support the People's Liberation Army. The local people are helping the People's Liberation Army solve difficulties with unparalleled enthusiasm and initiative. On the first day that a certain unit entered the Pingchuan area of Jinzhong, supplies were not delivered in time. The masses in nearby villages immediately gathered grain and lent it to the troops. When a certain unit was transferred to accept a combat mission, there was a temporary shortage of grain for dry rations. When the villagers heard about this, they immediately ground flour and made pancakes overnight. A certain village made 1,000 catties of dry rations in the middle of the night and lent them to the troops. An old lady had not yet harvested her wheat, but she immediately told her old man to cut it back, rush to grind it, and make pancakes. She said, "If we can't supply the troops, we can't eliminate the Gouzi army (referring to the Yan bandits), and the wheat won't be ours either." A certain village in Pingyao organized all the people and livestock in the village to push mills, thresh grain, and transport goods day and night, non-stop, and supplied the troops with 2,000 catties of dry rations and flour in one and a half days. Many farmers would rather eat coarse noodles themselves and lend good noodles to the troops, and they automatically supplied the troops with firewood, grass, and animal feed, and organized stretcher teams to transport the wounded. They said, "Our troops came to fight with food and stretchers, liberating us from the feet of the Gouzi army. If we don't help them a bit, we'll be letting the comrades down!" The masses were extremely caring for the wounded. After the troops were transferred, the masses in a certain village in Jiexiu automatically hid two wounded soldiers who had fallen behind and carried them back to their original unit. If the troops accidentally forgot something, the masses would immediately find a way to send it back. When the masses in various places heard that the People's Liberation Army was about to pass through, every household prepared relief supplies and boiled mung bean soup to wait for them.
