Xinhua News Agency, North China, 1st: According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas, the Chiang government's actively progressing plan to relocate the Tangshan Steel Plant to the south has aroused resolute opposition from the plant's workers. After receiving a secret order from the Chiang-held Resources Committee last month, the plant began dismantling all important machinery and equipment, preparing to transport it to Daye, southeast of Wuhan. All 600-plus workers in the plant are facing the threat of unemployment due to being "laid off" by the factory. They formed a "Plant Protection Association" and launched a plant protection movement. On the 21st of last month, they held a reception for the press, expressing their firm opposition to the Chiang authorities' dismantling and relocation of the plant to the south.

　　唐山钢厂工人反对拆厂南迁
    【新华社华北一日电】据蒋区报纸消息：蒋政府正积极进行中的唐山钢铁厂南迁计划，已引起该厂工人坚决反对。该厂于上月得蒋记资委会密令后，即开始拆卸全部重要机器及设备，准备运往武汉东南之大冶。全厂六百余工人面临被厂方“遣散”之失业威胁，乃组成“护厂会”，发起护厂运动，于上月二十一日招待新闻界，表示坚决反对蒋记当局拆厂南移。
