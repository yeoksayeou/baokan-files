Several Problems in Yuanshi's Production and Disaster Relief Work
    Zhan Chao

    Except for the first and second districts in the west, most of Yuanshi County is newly liberated. Due to the long-term devastation by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, a severe spring famine was caused this year. In March of the solar calendar, the number of people without food in the county reached more than 25,000, accounting for about one-sixth of the total population. However, under the leadership of our Party and government, the county's masses launched a production self-salvation movement, and finally victoriously overcame the spring famine. Not only did they achieve the goal of "no one starving to death, no land left uncultivated," but many people also bought production materials such as livestock and agricultural tools during the production self-salvation process.

    What problems did the county encounter in its production and disaster relief work, and how were these problems solved? The following is a summary report of the initial investigation and research.

    　　　　I. Why Do Cadres Disregard Production and Disaster Relief Work?

    Initially, county and district cadres generally disregarded this work. Whoever was asked to do it was unhappy, saying, "The higher-ups look down on us! First-class cadres engage in equal distribution, and they call us second-class cadres to engage in production!" Some even said, "Going home to be a civilian is not shameful!" They focused their attention on the eight Party rectification and land reform experiment villages and were indifferent to the growing famine.

    Why did this phenomenon occur? The main reason was that the leadership initially did not pay enough attention to this work. At the beginning of March, when county and district cadres completed their reorganization and were assigned tasks, the county Party committee announced the decisions of the district Party committee and the Central Bureau that before the spring plowing, the focus would be on supplementing Party rectification and promoting democracy, and once the spring plowing arrived, all efforts should be devoted to production, with production as the center. Although production and disaster relief were mentioned at the same time as the land reform key experiments, the actual tasks assigned were centered on the land reform key experiments. In terms of the allocation of forces, many key cadres were concentrated in a few land reform experiment villages, and those sent to investigate the disaster situation were mostly cadres who had not participated in the reorganization. They themselves had many ideological problems and naturally could not complete the investigation tasks well. Therefore, the county Party committee did not have a good understanding of the disaster situation below. This phenomenon continued until the poverty-stricken peasant training class in the Sixth District on March 15.

    The initial purpose of running the training class was to attempt to unite the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village through the trained poor and lower-middle peasants, and strive to complete all the new district land reform work before the wheat harvest. However, this policy contradicted the masses' demand for production. Once it was proposed, it was resisted. The poor and lower-middle peasants generally reflected, "Today we are here listening to the Land Law, and tomorrow there will be no rice to cook at home!" After investigation, in the 23 villages of the entire Sixth District, with 4,817 households, 1,012 households were currently short of food (i.e., had nothing to eat), accounting for 21% of the total number of households in the district. In villages with severe disasters, the proportion was even greater, such as Dongfu Village, with a total of 83 households, 28 households were currently short of food, accounting for more than 34% of the total number of households in the village. At the same time, the poor and lower-middle peasant training class in the Chengguan District also raised this issue, which made the county Party committee deeply realize the seriousness of this year's spring famine and the importance of paying attention to the season when arranging work. Therefore, on the one hand, it sounded the alarm to cadres throughout the county, and on the other hand, it began to take the following measures: (1) Reduce the number of land reform experiment base villages (starting with eight, first reduced to seven, and then to four), and draw out some strong cadres to participate in the production and disaster relief work team; (2) Put forward the slogan: "Whoever neglects production and disaster relief will commit a crime," demanding that all cadres mobilize and strive to achieve the goal of "no one starving to death, no land left uncultivated."

    　　　　II. Paternalistic Relief or Production Self-Salvation?

    After solving the cadres' idea of ​​disregarding production and disaster relief, a new problem was immediately encountered, that is, whether to adopt a paternalistic relief policy or a production self-salvation policy? At the beginning, many cadres were afraid that the disaster-stricken households would not be able to control themselves, waste the grain and money at once, and have nothing to provide relief in the future, thus creating a paternalistic phenomenon. For example, the staff of the Huayuan in Chengguan District distributed five taels of rice per person per day to 14 poor peasant households; while Laixiang Village distributed relief grain equally according to the population and land area of the entire village, stipulating that those with an average of one mu of land or less per person would receive three he of rice, those with one to two mu would receive two he of rice, and those with more than two mu would receive one he of rice… The result of paternalistic relief was that relief grain and loans, which could have solved some problems, failed to play their due role. Contrary to paternalistic relief was mobilizing the masses for production self-salvation. For example, Zhang Laoheng, a middle peasant in Fucun Village, Sixth District, was blind and had no labor at home. When the enemy bandits were there, he sold all his furniture due to excessive burdens. After the New Year, the children picked locust beans and pulled soybeans to mix with bran for food. Later, when the locust beans were gone, the whole family went begging. This time, he was loaned 117 catties of grain and 10,000 Jichaos to help him with production self-salvation. His family was very enthusiastic and immediately carried out division of labor: Zhang Laoheng held the child, the older children hoed the ground and picked up firewood, and the two women spun cotton. They spun an average of one catty of cotton (market weight) per day, earning 500 yuan (Jichaos), and each market day they could measure "a small dou of sorghum, enough for the family to eat and drink, and now they have even planted the land, and there is hope for the autumn harvest. Another example is poor peasant Zhang Hengtai, who has five people and three mu of land, with a spinning wheel and a weaving machine. In the past, he only had two bolts of cloth as capital and could not make it work. This time, he was loaned 30,000 Jichaos to use as capital for production self-salvation. Now he can produce three bolts of cloth every market day, earning 5,000 yuan. In addition to taking care of his family, he also has some surplus… The leadership immediately seized these vivid and concrete facts and widely educated the cadres and masses, overcoming the paternalistic views of the cadres and the psychology of waiting for relief among the masses, and launched a mass production self-salvation movement.

    　　　　III. Who Says We Can't Overcome the Famine Without Moving the Middle Peasants?

    Before the masses established a positive view of production self-salvation, one idea that coexisted with waiting for relief was the idea of ​​moving the middle peasants. Coupled with the cadres' one-sided views of the poor and lower-middle peasants and tailism, at the beginning of the production and disaster relief work, there was a strong trend that we could not overcome the famine without moving the middle peasants, and some biases arose from this. There are two specific manifestations: First, middle peasants are excluded when lending money; second, production materials such as livestock and vehicles of middle peasants are挪用随意 (arbitrarily used). For example, when poor peasants in Laixiang Village, Chengguan District, discussed loans, they not only did not allow middle peasants to participate, but also drove out the middle peasants who had already attended the meeting; Sizhuang Village, Fourth District, used the livestock carts of three well-off middle peasant households to transport grain, and all the money earned was given to the poor peasants (poor peasants who did not transport also received 6,000 Jichaos per person); Wang Chuangcheng, a militiaman in Gangwang Village, Sixth District, wanted to haul manure and asked the village chief to send livestock, and Li Qieshu, a member of the poor peasant group, also wanted to plow the land and also asked the village chief to send livestock. As a result, the village chief sent livestock to a middle peasant's home in a confused manner. The next day, the two went to pull the livestock and quarreled in front of the middle peasant's home. This middle peasant felt very embarrassed, felt that feeding the livestock and subsidizing the forage would not allow him to cultivate in time, and he had offended people… As a result, middle peasant households with difficulties did not have anything to produce to overcome the famine, and middle peasants who could maintain their lives were producing passively, affecting the development of the entire mass production self-salvation movement.

    After discovering these biases, the county Party committee proposed "Do not infringe on a single middle peasant household," requiring cadres throughout the county to correct their policy thinking, and uniting middle peasants in action by absorbing middle peasants to participate in production and disaster relief meetings, compensating middle peasants who have been damaged, and carry out production self-salvation together. Because the leadership was resolute and stipulated effective measures, such as dividing the enemy and puppet materials confiscated throughout the county at the time of liberation and the fruits of struggle preserved by the villages into two types: relief and loans (relief grain and money, focusing on giving to widowed and lonely disaster victims without labor, loaning grain and money focusing on people with production capacity but without living and production capital), adopting two methods of relief and distribution, and promoting and organizing the rational use of loans and grain loans in accordance with the spirit of production self-salvation. As a result, not only the negative phenomenon of restricting the middle peasants was curbed, but also social wealth was increased from a positive perspective. For example, seven villages in Chengguan District had 504 disasters and loaned a total of 11.41 million yuan (Jichaos, the same below), of which 158 households used 4,188,000 yuan to do small businesses; 158 households used 2,226,000 yuan for spinning and weaving; 83 households used 1,254,000 yuan to purchase agricultural tools; and 105 households used 3,742,000 yuan to buy livestock. The latter two items accounted for 43.6% of the total loans.

    　　　　IV. How to Solve the Land Problem of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in the New Areas Where Land Reform Has Not Been Carried Out?

    After breaking through the indifference to the famine, the leaders of Yuanshi vigorously organized the masses to carry out sideline production such as spinning, weaving, transportation, and small businesses, solving the urgent problem of the masses' food. However, in the early stage of the movement, not enough attention was paid to agricultural production, which made the mass production self-salvation movement unsustainable. When the spring plowing and planting came, this problem was raised. The new areas have not undergone land reform, and many poor and lower-middle peasants are still in a state of landlessness or land shortage. Therefore, how to properly solve the land problem of poor and lower-middle peasants in the production self-salvation movement became a central issue in Yuanshi's work at that time.

    The methods they adopted at that time were two: One was to distribute the land initially mobilized last year to the poor and lower-middle peasants and the middle peasants lacking land for cultivation after a general evaluation, according to the average number, and finally determine the land ownership when it is equally divided in the future. One is to borrow land from landlords and rich peasants and distribute it to the poor and lower-middle peasants for temporary cultivation. In order to solve the particularly difficult problems of the poor and lower-middle peasants, when borrowing surplus land from landlords and rich peasants, a part of his wheat seedlings was borrowed as appropriate according to the situation, and the average number was taken care of during distribution, but only the right to use the land was determined, not the right to own it. A situation may occur here (and it actually happened), that is, the borrowed land may be large without going through the classification of classes; in this regard, the county Party committee emphasized "borrowing the land of particularly obvious landlords and rich peasants first" while proposing to borrow the surplus land of landlords and rich peasants, "rather leak borrowing the land of ten landlords and rich peasants than mistakenly moving the land of one middle peasant," and in order to ensure the realization of this principle, specially organized cadres to study the classification of classes. As for whether the land ownership is determined or not, it is mainly a problem within the peasants and will be finally dealt with when it is officially divided in the future. For obvious landlords who have not been liquidated, it does not matter at all. While borrowing land from landlords and rich peasants, we widely carried out policy education among the masses, explaining that we would never move the middle peasants (if some places did, we would resolutely return and compensate), and called on everyone to devote all their efforts to production self-salvation and not wait for equal distribution. When determining the right to use the land, we announced "whoever plants it will harvest it," stipulating that if middle and poor peasants cannot afford to raise seeds, they can find relatives and friends to help, or hire short-term workers. Those without labor can semi-plant or rent it out, and will never become a status because of this.

　　元氏生产救灾工作中的几个问题
    展潮
    元氏县除西部一、二区外，大部是解放不久的新区。由于日寇和蒋家匪帮长期蹂躏，造成今年严重的春荒，阳历三月，全县断炊人数达二万五千余人，约占总人口六分之一。但经我党政领导全县群众展开生产自救运动，终于胜利渡过了春荒，不仅实现了“不饿死人，不荒地”的方针，许多群众还在生产自救过程中，买进牲口农具等生产资料。
    该县生产救灾工作中遇到了一些什么问题，这些问题怎样解决的？就初步调查研究所得，摘要报导于后。
    　　　　一、为啥干部轻视生产救灾工作？
    最初县区干部普遍轻视这一工作，叫谁做谁就不高兴，说：“上级看不起咱！一等干部搞平分，叫咱二等干部来搞生产！”甚至说：“回家为民，不算丢人！”把眼光都集中在八个整党土改实验村上，对日益发展着的灾荒漠不关心。
    为什么产生这种现象？主要原因是领导上开始对这个工作重视得不够，三月初县区干部整编结束布置工作时，县委虽宣布区党委和中央局的决定，春耕未到以抽补整党民主为中心，春耕一到，即应全力进行生产，以生产为中心；虽与土改重点试验同时提到生产救灾，而实际规定任务则以土改重点试验为中心。在力量的配备上，也是把很多主要干部集中在少数土改实验村里，派去调查灾情的多是未参加整编的干部，他们本身思想问题就很多，自然不能很好完成调查任务了。因此，县委对下面灾情不够了解。这种现象，一直继续到三月十五日六区贫雇训练班时才被打破。
    当初开办训练班的目的，是企图经过受训练的贫雇回去串连村中贫雇团结中农，争取麦收前完成全部新区土改工作，但这个方针与群众要求生产相矛盾，一经提出，即遭到抵抗，贫雇普遍反映说：“今天在这里听土地法，明天家里还没有米下锅哩！”经过调查，全六区二十三个村，四千八百十七户，当下扣的（即没吃的）即达一千零十二户，占全区总户数百分之二十一，而灾情严重的村庄，比例更大，如东富村，共八十三户，当下扣者二十八户，占全村总户口百分之三十四强。与此同时，城关区贫雇训练班亦提出这一问题，这才使县委深刻认识到今年春荒的严重性以及布置工作必须注意季节重要性，于是一方面向全县干部敲起警钟，一方面开始采取下列措施：（一）减少土改实验基点村（开始八个，先减成七个，后减成四个），把若干强有力的干部抽出来参加生产救灾工作队；（二）提出：“谁要忽视生产救灾，就要造成罪恶”的口号，要求全体干部动员起来，为实现“不饿死人，不荒地”的方针而奋斗。
    　　　　二、包办恩赐救济，还是生产自救？
    解决了干部轻视生产救灾思想，马上又碰到一个新问题，就是采取包办恩赐救济方针，还是采取生产自救方针？开始，有不少干部怕受灾户掌握不住自己，把粮款一下子浪费了，将来没东西救济，因而产生包办恩赐现象，例如：城关区花园的工作人员，把救济粮每天每人按五两米发给十四户贫农；而来厢村更把救济粮按全村人口地亩平均分配，规定一口人平均一亩地以下的，发三合米，一亩至二亩的，发二合米，二亩以上的，发一合米………。包办恩赐的结果，使本来可以解决一些问题的救济粮、贷款发挥不到它应有的作用。与包办恩赐相反的，就是发动群众生产自救。例如六区富村中农张老恒，是个瞎子，家中没劳力，敌匪在时因负担过重，把家具全卖光了，过罢年，小孩拾槐拉豆，掺糠吃，以后槐豆也吃光了，全家就去要饭，这次一下贷给他一百十七斤粮，一万元冀钞，扶助他生产自救，他家情绪很高，立即进行分工：张老恒抱小孩，大孩、二孩锄地拾柴，两个妇女光管纺花，每天平均纺一斤花（市秤），赚五百元（冀钞），每集即可量“小斗高粱，够一家吃喝，现在连地也种上，秋粮也有着落了。又如贫农张恒太，五口人三亩地，有纺花车一辆，织布机一张，过去只有两匹布的本钱，干不开，这次贷给他冀钞三万元，依这来作资本进行生产自救，现在每集能出三匹布，赚五千元，顾住家口外，还有点长余……。领导上即抓取这些生动的具体事实，在干部群众中广泛进行教育，克服干部中的包办恩赐观点与群众中等待救济的心理，掀起了一个群众性的生产自救运动。
    　　　　三、谁说非动中农才能渡荒？
    在群众没有树立起生产自救的积极观点之前，与等待救济并存的一个思想，就是动中农的思想，加以干部中片面的贫雇观点、尾巴主义，在生产救灾工作初期，大有非动中农不能渡荒之势，并且由此产生了一些偏向，具体表现有二：一、贷款时排挤中农；二、随意挪用中农牲畜、车辆等生产资料，例如城关区来厢村贫雇讨论贷款时，不仅不叫中农参加，还把已到会的中农赶出来；四区使庄村用三户富裕中农的牲口大车去运粮，赚的钱全部归贫雇农（不去运的贫雇，每人也分到六千元冀钞）；六区岗汪村民兵王闯成想拉粪，叫村长派牲口，贫农团委员李怯树要犁地，也要村长派牲口，结果因马虎都派到一家中农家里，第二天天明二人去拉牲口，当面争吵起来，这户中农在旁感到很为难，觉得喂牲口、贴草料，不能及时耕种，还得罪了人……致使有困难的中农户没有东西生产渡荒，能维持生活的中农生产消极，影响整个群众性生产自救运动的开展。
    发现了这些偏向后，县委提出“不要侵犯一户中农”，要求全县干部端正政策思想，并用吸收中农参加生产救灾会议、补偿受损害的中农，在行动中团结中农，一块进行生产自救。由于领导上坚决，并规定有效措施，例如将全县解放时缴获的敌伪物资，以及各村保存的斗争果实，分成救济与借贷两种（救济粮款，着重放给孤寡无劳力的灾民，贷粮款着重于有生产能力而无生活与生产资本的人），采取救济与发放两种方法，并且根据生产自救精神提倡与组织贷款贷粮的合理使用。结果不仅消极的制动中了农的现象，而且从积极方面增加社会财富。例如城关区七个村五○四灾，共贷款一一四一万元（冀钞，下同），用来做小买卖的一五八户，四一八八○○○元；用来纺织的一五八户，二二二六○○○元；用来购买农具的八三户，一二五四○○○元；用来买牲口的一○五户，三七四二○○○元。后两项，即占全部贷款百分之四三点六。
    　　　　四、在未进行土改的新区，怎样解决贫雇土地问题？
    元氏领导上打破了漠视灾荒之后，即大力组织群众进行纺织、运输、做小买卖等副业生产，解决了群众急不可待的吃饭问题。但在运动初期对农业生产注意是不够的，致使群众性的生产自救运动不能持久。待到春耕下种时，这问题便被提出来了。新区未经过土地改革，许多贫雇农仍处在无地少地的状态，因此，如何在生产自救运动中适当的解决贫雇农民的土地问题，便成为当时元氏工作中一个中心问题。
    他们当时所采取的办法有二：一是将去年初步运动出来的土地，经过大体评议，按平均数分给贫雇及缺地的中农耕种，待将来平分时最后确定地权。一是从地主富农手中抽借土地，分发给贫雇暂时耕作。并且为了解决特别困难的贫雇困难，抽借地富多余土地时，酌量情况抽借他一部麦苗地，分配时照顾平均数，但只确定土地使用权，不确定所有权，这里可能发生（实际上也发生了）一种情况，就是未经过划分阶级，抽借地面可能大；对此，县委在提出抽借地富多余土地同时，就强调提出“先借特别明显的地主富农土地”，“宁漏借十户地富，不错动一户中农”，并为了保证这个原则实现，专门组织干部学习划阶级。至于地权的确定与否，主要是农民内部的问题，留待将来正式平分时最后处理。对于未被清算的明显的地主来说，是丝毫也没有什么关系的。与抽借地富土地同时，遂在群众中广泛进行政策教育，说明绝不动中农（有的地方动了，坚决退回与补偿），号召大家全力生产自救，不要等待平分。确定土地使用权时，宣布“谁种谁收”，规定中农贫农养种不过来的，可找亲戚朋友帮助，或雇短工，无劳力者可半种或出租，绝不因此而变成份。
