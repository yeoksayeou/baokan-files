Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 28th: A frontline reporter reports on the process of the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Kaifeng, stating: After the People's Liberation Army cleared out the outer strongholds of Kaifeng, it completed the encirclement of the city with swift movements on the night of the 16th. At dusk on the 17th, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack from all directions. A certain unit, after 20 minutes of fierce fighting, first broke through the enemy's first line of defense in the South Gate, seized the airport, and forced the remnants of the enemy on the east and west sides of Zhongshan Road to gradually retreat, compressing them to the line of the post office and China Middle School. Another unit occupied the South Kaifeng Agricultural Experiment Station and destroyed an enemy armored train reinforcing along the railway. At 12 o'clock that night, another unit of the People's Liberation Army attacked Caoguan, and after an hour of combat, annihilated most of an enemy battalion. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army, attacking Songguan and Xiguan, also made smooth progress, controlling all of Songguan and approaching the West Gate. At 2:30 p.m. on the 18th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive against the isolated stronghold of the enemy at the South Gate Post Office. After a fierce artillery bombardment, the enemy's steel-reinforced concrete fortifications were destroyed, and despite enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, they charged courageously. By 5:00 p.m., the entire enemy force at the post office was annihilated. The brigade commander of the Chiang bandit's Henan Provincial Security First Brigade was killed here. At 11:00 p.m. that night, under the cover of heavy artillery, the People's Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on the Kaifeng city wall. Around 1:00 a.m. on the 19th, several spearheads advanced successively towards the Dananmen, Xin'nanmen, and Songmen, constantly repelling the enemy's counterattacks and consolidating the breakthrough points. Five platoons of a certain battalion of the People's Liberation Army, which had stormed into Xin'nanmen, independently persisted in combat for as long as seven hours. At about 10:00 a.m., the West Gate had already been captured by our army, and then a large number of follow-up troops of the People's Liberation Army entered the city simultaneously from various gates. The People's Liberation Army, which had stormed into Songmen, advanced southward along the city wall, joining forces with the fraternal troops that had stormed into Xin'nanmen, while crossing the Huiji River, advancing step by step and consolidating section by section. Soon, they joined forces with the People's Liberation Army that had stormed into Dananmen and Ximen, occupying all the enemy's artillery positions in the southwest of the city. That night, the People's Liberation Army continued to develop its offensive in the urban area. The enemy's morale was low, and they collapsed at a touch in the street fighting. By 10:00 a.m. on the 20th, the remaining enemy forces were finally compressed to the area west of Gonghe Road within the North Gate, including the North China Sports Field and Zhongshan Park. At 12:00 p.m., the People's Liberation Army captured the Chiang Kai-shek's Henan Provincial Government, capturing more than 3,000 Chiang soldiers alive. At dawn on the 21st, the People's Liberation Army continued to break through the enemy's core fortifications at the Jiaoyangyuan east of the Huiji River, completely annihilating the defending enemy. Subsequently, the enemy continued to bomb and strafe with artillery and aircraft, completely destroying the Jiaoyangyuan buildings, but the People's Liberation Army resolutely defended the positions they had gained, not yielding an inch of land. At about 9:00 a.m., two rows of enemy soldiers on the enemy's northwestern position of the Jiaoyangyuan raised white flags and surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. At 5:00 p.m., the People's Liberation Army launched a final general offensive against the enemy's core fortifications at the Gulongting. As soon as the artillery bombardment stopped, the heroic "Guo Jisheng" company assault team bravely rushed to the highest hall in only eight minutes, and another unit of the People's Liberation Army also rushed in, completely annihilating the enemy's 66th Division headquarters. By this point, the main positions and the general command of the Kaifeng defenders had been completely captured and annihilated. Only one or two isolated group bunkers remained to be eliminated. This was completed by noon on the 22nd. In the entire operation to liberate Kaifeng, nearly 30,000 enemy troops were annihilated.

    我军解放开封经过
    【新华社开封前线二十八日电】前线记者报导解放军解放开封作战经过称：解放军扫清开封外围各据点后，以神速的运动，于十六日夜完成了对该城的全部包围。十七日黄昏，解放军自各个方向发起攻击，某部经廿分钟激战，首先突破敌在南关的第一道防御线，抢占飞机场，迫使中山路东西残敌逐步后退，将该敌压缩至邮局及中国中学一线。另一部占领南开农业试验场，将沿铁路增援之敌铁甲车一列击毁。当夜十二时，解放军另一部攻击曹关，经一小时战斗，将敌一个营大部消灭。同时攻击宋关及西关之解放军亦顺利发展，将宋关全部控制，并迫近西门。十八日下午二时半，解放军对困守南关邮局孤立据点之敌发起总攻，经猛烈炮击后，将敌钢骨水泥工事据点摧毁，并不顾敌机轰炸扫射，勇猛冲锋，至五时，即将邮局敌全歼。蒋匪河南省保安第一旅旅长即在此被我击毙，当夜十一时，解放军在重炮掩护下猛攻开封城垣。十九日夜一时前后，数支箭头分向大南门，新南门，宋门先后突进，不断打退敌之反扑，巩固突破口。攻入新南门的解放军某营五个排，独立坚持作战达七小时之久。十时许西门已经我军攻入，于是大量解放军后续部队分由各门同时入城，攻入宋门之解放军一面沿城墙南下，与突进新南门之兄弟部队会合，一面强渡惠济河，步步前进，节节巩固。不久，即与攻入大南门与西门之解放军会师，将敌在城西南之炮兵阵地全部占领，当夜各路解放军继续在市区发展攻势，敌士气颓丧，在巷战中一触即溃。至二十日晨十时，终将残敌压缩于北门内共和路以西华北运动场、中山公园一带。十二时，解放军将蒋记河南省政府全部攻占后生俘蒋军三千余人。二十一日拂晓，解放军继续突破惠济河以东教养院敌之核心工事，全歼守敌。旋敌继以炮火及飞机轰炸扫射，将教养院房屋全部炸倒，但解放军坚守既得阵地，寸土不让。九时许，教养院西北敌阵上，有两排敌高举白旗向解放军投降。下午五时，解放军最后总攻古龙亭敌核心工事。炮击甫停，英雄“郭继胜”连突击队仅八分钟即英勇冲上最高之大殿，另一部解放军亦即冲入，当将敌六十六师师部全部歼灭。至此，开封守敌之主要阵地总指挥部亦被全部攻占及歼灭，仅余一、二处孤立的集团地堡尚有歼敌，延至二十二日中午，亦被全部肃清。在解放开封的整个作战中共歼守敌近三万人。
