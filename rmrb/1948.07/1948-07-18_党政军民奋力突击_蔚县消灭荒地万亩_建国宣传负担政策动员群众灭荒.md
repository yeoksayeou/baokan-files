[Chahar News] The Party, government, army, and people of Wei County have launched a vigorous assault, eliminating more than 11,000 mu of wasteland. Wei County is a relatively wealthy county in southern Chahar. After more than a year of cruel rule by the bandit Fu, over 16,541 mu of land in the county was deserted (figures for one district missing). One-third of the families in the county had nothing to eat, and there was a severe shortage of manpower, animal power, and seeds. After our army advanced into southern Chahar, it immediately cooperated with the government to reclaim the wasteland. The government issued agricultural loans of 280 million yuan (border currency), and the army also contributed manpower and animal power to help with planting, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses for production. A certain artillery company of a certain unit helped the people cultivate 90 mu of land in three days; a certain logistics department had 144 animals help the villagers deliver 500 loads of manure and cultivate more than 200 mu of land in four days; convalescents Wang Zhong, Feng Tianxi, and others helped the masses weed 17 mu of seedlings despite their illness, and the civilian laborers accompanying the army also seized the opportunity to help the villagers stationed in the villages with production. At present, more than 11,281 mu of wasteland has been eliminated in the county, and the small seedlings have been hoed once. Recently, the government has again urgently called for the complete elimination of wasteland, and the masses in various places are continuing their assault.

[Jizhong 10th Dispatch] Jianguo and other counties continue to launch an assault to eliminate wasteland and sow seeds. Jianguo County has found 1,228 mu of wasteland in 96 villages; some of this wasteland is land confiscated or requisitioned from landlords and rich peasants that has not been fully distributed; some is land left behind by fleeing households; some is land that peasants have abandoned due to a lack of livestock and inability to cultivate; and some is honorary soldiers’ land left in the villages with no one to cultivate it. On June 23, the county had rainfall, and the leadership immediately called for seizing the time to eliminate wasteland. However, the masses had many concerns in their minds. Some were afraid that if they planted wasteland now, they would have to pay more public grain during the autumn harvest; some village cadres were afraid that if they planted more land, others would say they were taking too much fruit and were unwilling to take the lead in planting more; and some were afraid of “struggle” if they had more land. The leadership conducted extensive publicity through various meetings, repeatedly explaining that land reform was for the purpose of developing production and getting rich; villages where land reform had been thoroughly carried out would no longer implement land reform; future burdens would be paid according to the normal annual output, and those who increased yields through intensive farming and good management would never have their burdens increased. They also used accounting methods to explain that planting wasteland was not only not a loss but also of great benefit to themselves. After publicity and explanation, the masses' concerns were gradually eliminated. In five days, 5,135 mu of wasteland were eliminated, and another 1,093 mu were being continued to be eliminated. In 98 villages in Hejian County, 2,882 mu of wasteland were found. The main reasons for the wasteland were that there was a lot of saline-alkali land, the peasants were unwilling to plant it, and they were afraid of heavy burdens. In order to eliminate the wasteland, the county's Tuotuo Society went to various districts in groups to cooperate with local cadres and lead the masses to eliminate the wasteland as they investigated. By the end of June, more than 1,900 mu had been eliminated in the county.

　　党政军民奋力突击
    蔚县消灭荒地万亩
    建国宣传负担政策动员群众灭荒
    【察哈尔讯】蔚县党政军民奋力突击，消灭荒地一万一千多亩。该县是察南较富县份，经傅匪一年多残酷统治，全县荒芜土地一万六千五百四十一亩（缺一个区数字），全县有三分之一的人家没吃的，人力畜力及种子都很缺乏。我军挺进察南后，当即协同政府抢救荒地，政府发放农贷二亿八千万元（边币），军队也抽出人畜力帮助抢种，群众生产情绪大大提高。×部炮兵连三天助民耕地九十亩；×后勤部四天中有一百四十四头牲口帮老乡送粪五百担，耕地二百多亩；休养员王仲、冯天喜等带病帮群众拔苗十七亩，随军民工也抓紧空隙帮助驻村群众生产。现全县已消灭荒地一万一千二百八十一亩，小苗已锄过头遍。最近政府又紧急号召彻底消灭荒地，各地群众正继续突击中。
    【冀中十日电】建国等县继续突击灭荒播种。建国九十六个村查出荒地一千二百二十八亩；这些荒地一部分是没收与征收地富的土地，没完全分配下去；一部分是逃亡户留下的地；一部分是农民因缺乏牲口、无法耕种荒了的；还有一部分是村中所留无人耕种的荣军田。六月二十三日该县降雨，领导上立即号召抓紧时间消灭荒地。但群众思想上存在很多顾虑，有的怕现在种了荒地，秋征时出公粮多；有的村干部怕多种了地，别人说多占果实，不愿带头多种；还有些人怕地多了“斗争”。领导上通过各种会议，进行了广泛宣传，反复说明土改就是为了发展生产，发家致富；土改已经彻底的村，就不再实行土改了；今后负担按照常年应产量交纳，凡因精耕细作，善于经营而增加收成者绝不增加负担。并用算帐方法，说明种荒地不仅不吃亏，对自己好处很大。经过宣传解释，逐渐消除了群众的顾虑。在五天中，即消灭荒地五千一百三十五亩，还有一千零九十三亩正继续消灭中。河间九十八个村中，查出二千八百八十二亩荒地，荒了的主要原因是硷薄地多，农民不愿种，又怕负担重。该县推拖社为消灭荒地，便分头到各区配合当地干部，领导群众随查随消灭。到六月底，全县消灭一千九百多亩。
