Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Dispatch: The families of workers in mines and factories in Northeast China, as well as urban women, are actively participating in various production efforts. Over 2,100 women in the Second Coal Mine area, under the leadership of the mine's women's association, have taken on the primary responsibility of cultivating 1,150 hectares of land within the mining area. Every morning, after preparing meals for their husbands to go to work, they gather in the fields to work. In addition to the above-mentioned cultivation tasks, women at the First Mine have also reclaimed more than 20 mu of wasteland. They have also organized a textile factory with dozens of people, with the women of each mine spinning thread for weaving. Profits for April and May reached 3.99 million yuan. Some strong women in the Second Mine also participated in various odd jobs at the mine, replacing male laborers. In order to leverage the labor of women in workers' families and increase family income, the Harbin Tram Factory's trade union, through its welfare and women's departments, jointly organized production by workers' family members. They introduced more than 70 young women to work in toothbrush and match factories, provided production materials, and organized family members to sew shoe soles and spin yarn. The factory also recruited female workers from workers' families, training 32 female workers in the electrical materials, coil winding, and artificial mica departments. The Qiqihar district and street governments actively support and organize women's production. In the Fifth Street of the Second District, there are nearly 200 women spinners who can spin about 1,100 jin of thread each month. Women in the Seventh Street of the Fourth District have also voluntarily gathered 16 sewing machines to establish a small factory, recruiting women to participate in making military uniforms. To facilitate the participation of housewives in production, the street has also established a kindergarten that can accommodate more than 160 children. With the help of the government, women in other streets are also heavily involved in sideline production such as sewing shoe soles, spinning thread, and weaving mats, improving family life. After the Second Street of Jiamusi City mobilized women to spin thread, the number of spinners has increased to more than 2,000. The enthusiasm for production among the spinners is extremely high, and they are now working to improve quality and eliminate third-grade thread. In Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, under the active spinning and weaving of more than 13,500 women, the textile industry has achieved great development. There were originally four textile factories during the puppet Manchurian regime, and now there are nine weaving factories. Forty thousand jin of cotton are often distributed to spinners in various places. In recent years, a total of 140,000 jin of thread have been spun and more than 20,000 bolts of cloth have been woven, solving and improving the living difficulties of the urban poor.

　　东北职工眷属城市妇女积极参加各项生产
    【新华社东北电】东北各矿山、工厂职工眷属及城市妇女，纷纷投入各种生产工作。第二煤矿区二千一百余妇女在该矿妇女的领导下担负了矿区内一千一百五十垧土地耕种的主要任务。每天清晨她们照料丈夫吃过饭上工后，就集合到地里工作。第一矿妇女于参加上述耕种任务之外，并增开荒地二十多亩。另外还组织一个拥有数十人的纺织厂，由各矿妇女纺线供给织布。四、五两月赢利达三百九十九万元。第二矿若干强壮妇女并参加矿上一些杂工工作，代替了男子杂工。哈尔滨电车厂职工会为了发挥工人家庭中妇女的劳动力和增加工人家庭收入，特由福利部与妇女部共同组织职工家属生产，介绍了七十余年轻妇女参加牙刷、洋火等工厂工作，并供给生产材料，组织家属纳鞋底，纺纱等。厂方亦招收工人家属妇女，培养电材部、卷线部、人造云母部等女工三十二名。齐齐哈尔各区街政府积极扶助与组织妇女生产。二区五街已有纺妇近二百名，每月能纺线一千一百斤左右。四区七街妇女并自动集中十六架缝纫机，成立一个小工厂，吸收妇女参加做军衣。该街为便利家庭妇女参加生产，并成立幼稚园一所，可容纳儿童一百六十余名。其他各街妇女亦均在政府帮助下，大批卷入纳鞋底、纺线、编席等副业生产，改善家庭生活。佳木斯市二街动员妇女纺线后，纺妇已增至两千余名。纺妇生产情绪极为高涨，现正为提高质量，消灭第三等线而努力。松江省双城县在一万三千五百余妇女积极纺织下，纺织业已获得极大发展，伪满时原有纺织厂四家，现已有织布厂九家。经常有四万斤棉花分散于各地纺妇手中。年来共纺线十四万斤，织布两万余匹。解决与改善了城区贫民的生活困难。
