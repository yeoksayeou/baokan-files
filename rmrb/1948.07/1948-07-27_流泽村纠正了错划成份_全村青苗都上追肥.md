　　【Taihang News】After the democratic party rectification movement in Liuze Village, Fifth District of Huguan, especially after the second class division correction, compensation was given to wrongly struggled middle peasants, and landlords and rich peasants were resettled. Social order stabilized, various classes tended towards harmony and unity, the party's policies were clarified, and ideological concerns were dispelled, leading to a shift towards active production. The entire village has 45.5 hectares of land. Except for wheat fields, 35 hectares of seedlings have been hoed twice for 90% of the area, and 27 hectares have been universally topdressed. Middle peasant Li Shuanhong said, "When the land law came down in the spring, everyone said it would be equally divided, so I didn't dare use manure, fearing that I wouldn't be able to harvest what I planted. If I had known it wouldn't be equally divided, I would have used more." Now, in addition to applying his family's manure, he has also bought 650 jin of sesame cakes and topdressed all 8.2 acres of his seedlings. Zhao Quanshui said, "In the spring, others said I was a rich peasant. I didn't understand the policies well, and I thought I should take a break early, not knowing when I would be struggled against. This time, after reclassifying, I was classified as a well-to-do middle peasant, and I felt relieved. My family's 31 acres of seedlings have been universally topdressed, with a total of 280 dan of farm manure, 950 dan of sheep manure, and 67 dan of farm manure, an average of 45 dan per acre." Bao Zhongfu is a new middle peasant, and his family didn't have enough manure. He searched and bought everywhere, using three dou of rice to buy the farm manure from three toilets in the district office to fully supplement his needs. Middle peasant Qin Haifu was wrongly struggled against last year and was gloomy all day long. This time, he was compensated during the correction. He happily said, "As long as you take off my landlord hat, I don't need compensation. I've suffered all my life, and production is not a problem." Currently, the masses in the entire village are actively topdressing and hoeing more, making up for the losses in spring plowing, and striving for a bumper harvest.

　　流泽村纠正了错划成份
  　全村青苗都上追肥
    【太行讯】壶关五区流泽村经过民主整党运动，特别经过二次划阶级纠偏以后，补偿了错斗中农，安置了地主富农，社会秩序安定、各阶层趋于和谐团结，又摸清了党的政策，解除了思想上的顾虑，转向积极生产。全村共土地四十五顷半，除麦地以外，三十五顷青苗，已有百分之九十锄过二遍，二十七顷普遍上到追肥。中农李拴红说：“春天土地法下来，都说一律平分，咱有粪也不敢上，光怕种上收不成，早知不平分，可要多上哩。”现在他除把家里的圈粪上了外，又买了六百五十斤麻饼，将八亩二分青苗全部上了追肥。赵泉水说：“春天别人都说我是富农，咱对政策也摸不透，心想趁早歇歇吧，还不知那天挨斗哩。这次重新划阶级，我划成富裕中农，才放下心来。我家三十一亩青苗，普遍上了追肥，共上圈粪二百八十担，羊粪九百五十担，圈粪六十七担，每亩平均四十五担。”鲍中福是个新中农，家里粪不够用，东找西买，用三斗米买下区公所三个厕所的圈粪完全补上。中农秦海付去年被错斗了后，整天愁眉苦脸，这次纠偏中实行补偿，他高兴的说：“只要给我摘掉地主帽子，不补偿也行，咱一辈子就是受苦出身，生产不成问题。”现全村群众正在积极上追肥多锄，补足春耕损失，争取丰收。
