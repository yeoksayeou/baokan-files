Resolutely Protect Industry and Commerce
    Changzhi City Returns Yi Ji Pharmacy
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Yi Ji Pharmacy in Changzhi has been in operation for over fifty years, with capital exceeding 20 million (Ji banknotes), making it one of the larger industrial and commercial enterprises in Changzhi City. During the "investigation and squeezing" campaign last July, rural struggle methods were mistakenly applied, and Yi Ji Pharmacy was also subjected to struggle. It was then transformed into the "Workers and Citizens Pharmacy," a cooperative production venture.

    After studying the city policies and the industrial and commercial policies, the work team resolutely corrected the deviation. Initially, the proposal to return Yi Ji Pharmacy met with resistance from some cadres and activists who had participated in the struggle, as well as workers and shop assistants who had received shares. They argued, "We dared to struggle because the higher authorities told us to. If the higher authorities tell us to return it, then we will return it." Addressing this mindset, the leadership first offered self-criticism, explaining that they had failed to distinguish between feudalism and capitalism in the past and did not understand the Party's industrial and commercial policies, resulting in the wrong struggle last year. They emphasized that now that they understood the policies, they should resolutely correct the mistake. Subsequently, through meetings and individual talks, they repeatedly conducted policy and ideological education, enlightening everyone about the benefits of developing industry and commerce for their own personal interests. At this point, correct and positive opinions emerged among the masses. Some said, "Returning it is the right thing to do. If it's not returned, no one will dare to develop. The more industry and commerce develops in Changzhi City, the more benefits we workers and shop assistants will have." The leadership paid attention to guiding and elevating this thinking, linking the Party's policies with the people's immediate interests. Most people gradually came to understand. Xu Qihuai, an activist in the struggle who initially resisted the return, said, "I am a blacksmith worker. If Yi Ji is returned, other businesses will dare to develop, which will also benefit me as a blacksmith." With the masses' thinking straightened out, the return process began, totaling more than 26.8 million. Seeing that Yi Ji Pharmacy was genuinely being returned, the masses in the city said, "If Yi Ji, worth over 20 million, is being returned to its original owner, what are we afraid of with our small businesses!" Many people dug out silver dollars and assets to expand their businesses.

### 坚决保护工商业　长治市退还义记药房

　　坚决保护工商业
    长治市退还义记药房
    【本报讯】长治义记药房有五十多年的经营历史，资本达两千万以上（冀钞），为长市较大工商业之一。去年七月查挤运动时，错误的搬用了农村的斗争方式，把义记药房也斗了。改为群众合作生产的“职工市民药房”。
    工作组学习城市政策及工商业政策后，即坚决纠偏。最初提出要退还义记药房，有些过去斗争中的干部积极分子及分了股的工人店员想不通，说：“斗是上级叫斗，俺才敢斗，退也是上级叫退，退吧。”领导上针对着这种思想，首先作自我批评，说明过去没有把封建与资本界限分开，不懂得党的工商业政策，于去年斗争错了；今天了解了政策，就该坚决纠正。接着以会议及个别谈话等形式，反复进行政策思想教育，启发大家认识发展工商业对自己的切身利益。这时群众中产生了正确、积极的意见，有人说：“退是对的，不退谁也不敢发展。长治市工商业发展大了多了，咱们工人店员用的也多了”。领导上注意诱导提高这种思想，使党的政策和群众的切身利益连系起来。大部分人慢慢想通了。曾经不愿退的斗争中积极分子徐起怀说：“我是个铁匠工人，把义记退还了，别的买卖都敢发展，对我这铁匠也有好处。”群众思想打通，即着手退还，总共退还二千六百八十余万元。市内群众看见真的退还了义记药房，都说：“义记两千多万还退给原主了，何况这小买卖，怕甚哩”！许多人都刨出银洋、资财扩展营业了。
