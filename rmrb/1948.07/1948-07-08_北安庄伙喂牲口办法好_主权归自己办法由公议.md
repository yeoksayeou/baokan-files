　　[Hebei Central News] Beianzhuang Village, Shen County, distributed the livestock confiscated from landlords and requisitioned from wealthy farmers to ninety-eight poor and middle peasants lacking livestock, forming twenty-two groups, with each group jointly raising one animal. The peasants devised reasonable joint feeding methods, and the livestock are being raised very well. After distributing the livestock, the village convened a meeting of joint farming households on March 16th, inviting experienced farmers who had previously jointly raised livestock to introduce their methods. District cadres also raised some issues that should be paid attention to in joint livestock raising. In order to feed the livestock well and use them properly, a Tillage Livestock Department was established under the Production Committee to specifically guide the farmers in raising livestock, and a livestock inspection system was established. Group leaders of joint livestock groups hold a joint meeting once a month, also called the "Livestock Comparison Conference," which has been held three times so far, to report on the joint feeding methods of each group, exchange experiences, and study problems. The joint feeding method in the village is mostly based on the amount of land (that is, the amount of work), with rotating shifts for feeding, and there are regulations on how much fodder to feed each day. For example, the Niu Kui group feeds two large sheng of feed every day when in use, and an unspecified amount when idle. When it is my turn to feed and your turn to use, I provide the grass and you provide the feed. The Niu Daxue group feeds in one place because none of the households have a feeding place. Whoever provides the grass gets the manure, and the feed is distributed according to the amount of land. The Xue Lao Rope group originally rotated feeding, but later changed to rotating when idle and whoever uses it feeds it when busy. Some groups lack grass, so they pull carts for trade to earn money to buy grass, or the children cut grass, or more alfalfa is planted. The methods of use are: (1) During busy farming season, the Xue Lao Rope group uses "whoever has urgent work goes first, and those with less land go first for the same amount of work." (2) Grinding grain should take up idle time, and fieldwork takes precedence when busy. (3) The best method is for joint livestock households to allocate labor to help each other. Because there is a lot of work such as plowing, sowing, delivering manure, and hauling soil, it is difficult to coordinate use without mutual assistance, so everyone naturally formed various forms of mutual assistance. Some are group-wide mutual assistance; some are chain-like mutual assistance, such as the Xue family helping the Wang family, and the Wang family helping the Chen family; and some are wheel-like mutual assistance. There are also regulations for attendance: The Niu Kui group stipulates that Niu Kui and Lao Shuai go on long trips, and everyone shares the fodder and travel expenses according to the amount of land, with each person receiving one jin of rice, one jin of flour, and two thousand yuan (border currency) per day for expenses. Short trips (returning the same day) are taken by the children of Feng Dalou and Li Yintang. For short trips, whoever is feeding provides the fodder. The Lin Sijiu group stipulates that Lin Sijiu and Niu Lao Zhong go on long trips, and those who do not go share the fodder according to the amount of land, while those who go do not share; whoever is feeding goes on short trips. Since the livestock are jointly fed and used, the farm tools are also organized for joint use (mainly plows, harrows, vehicles, ropes, etc.), and if they are damaged, everyone jointly shares the cost of repair. Some groups take care of military personnel, workers, martyrs' families, and other people without labor when jointly raising livestock. For example, Li Widow was assigned a cow but no one to feed it, so she handed over the fodder she should have fed to Niu Kui and others, and the manure belonged to them. Now the livestock jointly raised in Beianzhuang are all well fed, and are generally used very well except for the Chen Guozheng and other two groups. Why are the livestock in Beianzhuang jointly raised so well? The group leaders said: "This is because we have ownership, and the livestock belongs to us; secondly, we discussed the methods ourselves." The village production committee's attention to this work is also a reason for raising and using them well. (Editor's note: The method of jointly raising livestock in Beianzhuang is successful. However, according to repeated experience, the phenomenon of only using without feeding often occurs in joint livestock feeding. How Beianzhuang overcame this phenomenon or did not have this phenomenon at all should continue to be reported and studied.)

### 北安庄伙喂牲口办法好　主权归自己办法由公议

　　北安庄伙喂牲口办法好
    主权归自己办法由公议
    【冀中讯】深县北安庄把没收地主的与征收富农多余的牲口，分配给九十八家缺牲口的贫中农，结合了二十二个小组，每组伙养一个。农民们想出合理的伙养办法，牲口养的很胖。该村分配牲口后，于三月十六日召集伙养户开会，并邀请本村过去伙养牲口有经验的农民参加，介绍伙养牲口的办法，区干也提出一些伙养牲口应注意的问题。为了把牲口喂好，使用得当，通过在生产委员会下成立一耕畜部，专门领导农民养牲口，并订了查牛制度，每月开伙牛组长联席会一次，或叫“比牛大会”，到现在先后召开了三次，汇报各组伙养办法，交换经验，研究问题。该村伙养的办法，多数组是按地亩多少（也就是活多少），分开天轮流喂，每日要喂多少草料，都有规定。如牛奎小组，使用时每天喂两大升料，闲时不拘数。遇到我喂你使的情况，我出草你拿料。牛大雪组因各户都没喂处，便在一个地方喂，谁出草谁要粪，按地亩摊料。薛老绳组原来轮流着喂，后来改为闲时轮流，忙时谁使谁喂。有的小组缺草，便拉脚作买卖赚钱买草，或由孩子们割草，或多种苜蓿。使用的办法：（一）在活忙时，薛老绳组是“谁活紧谁先使，一样的活尽地少的先使。”（二）拉碾磨要占闲时候，忙时先干地里活。（三）最好的办法是伙牛户拨工互助。因为耕、耩、送粪、拉土等活很多，如不互助，使用时很难搭配，于是大家自然的形成了各种各样的互助形式。有的是全组互助；有的是锁炼式的互助，如薛家和王家互助，王家又和陈家互助；还有的是车轮式的互助。出勤办法也有规定：牛奎组规定出远车由牛奎和老帅去，大家按地亩摊草料盘费，每人每天一斤米、一斤面、二千元（边币）零用。近车（当天能回来）由冯大楼、李印堂两家小孩去。近车是该谁喂谁出草料。林四九组规定出远车由林四九、牛老忠去，不去的人按亩摊草料，去的人不摊；出近车是谁喂谁去。由于牲口伙喂伙使，把农具也组织起来伙用（主要是犁、耙、车辆、绳套等），使坏了大家共同摊款修制。有些组伙养时照顾了军、工、烈属和其他无劳动力的人。如李寡妇分了牛没人喂，便把应喂的草料交给牛奎等人，粪归他们。现在北安庄伙养的牲口都喂得很好，除陈国证等两组外，一般的也使用的很好。为什么北安庄的牲口能伙养的好呢？组长们说：“这一来是因为有了所有权，牲口归了自个；二来是俺们自己讨论了办法。”村生产委员会重视这一工作，也是养好用好的一个原因。（编者按：北安庄伙养牲口办法是成功的。但根据多次经验，伙喂牲口常常发生光使不喂的现象，北安庄如何克服了此种现象或根本未发生此种现象，应继续报导研究。）
