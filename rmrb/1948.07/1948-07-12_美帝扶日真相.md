　　The Truth About US Imperialism Supporting Japan
　　On July 26, 1945, the United States, Britain, and China issued the Potsdam Declaration to Japan. After the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan, it also signed the declaration. The various clauses concerning Japan's unconditional surrender stipulated in this declaration are the highest principles that the Allied countries should follow in implementing their policies towards Japan. The declaration stipulates:
　　"The authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated forever, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice is impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.
　　………Until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed, Japanese territory, as designated by the Allies, must be occupied to ensure that the basic purposes we state herein are accomplished.
　　………Japanese troops, after complete disarmament, will be allowed to return to their homes and have the opportunity for a peaceful and productive life.
　　………War criminals shall be brought to justice. The Japanese government must remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, religion and thought, and respect for fundamental human rights must be established.
　　Japan will be allowed to maintain the industries necessary for its economy and to pay reparations in kind, but not those industries that can rearm it for war."
　　In simple terms, these principles are: war criminals must be severely punished; aggressive forces and militarism must be permanently eliminated; the Japanese government must implement democratic reforms; the Japanese people must obtain democratic freedoms; Japan will only be allowed to maintain industries necessary for its economy and to pay reparations; war industries and war-making capabilities must be destroyed; armaments must be completely dismantled; and the purpose of the Allied occupation of Japan is to achieve the above principles.
　　In December 1945, the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, with the consent of the Chinese government, decided to establish the Far Eastern Commission (composed of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, China, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, India, the Philippines, and New Zealand) as the decision-making body for implementing the Potsdam terms, with the power to review the instructions and measures of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces occupying Japan; at the same time, it was decided to establish the Allied Council for Japan (composed of representatives from the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, as well as joint representatives from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and India), stipulating that the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces must consult and confer with the Council before issuing orders on major matters. This council is commonly known as the Allied Control Council.
　　MacArthur, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, was stationed in Japan, and his mission was to thoroughly implement the Potsdam terms; all his control measures over Japan should be subject to the constraints of the Far Eastern Commission; and he was subject to a certain degree of constraint by the Allied Control Council on issues of "fundamental reorganization of the Japanese constitutional structure" or "overall reorganization of the Japanese government." (According to the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference resolution, on the above issues, if "one member of the Allied Control Council disagrees with the Supreme Commander, the Supreme Commander should temporarily suspend the issuance of orders on such issues until the Far Eastern Commission has reached an agreement on the matter.")
　　However, the actions of the US government and MacArthur in Japan for nearly three years have completely contradicted the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, and disregarded the power of the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Control Council, ignoring their numerous protests, consistently taking unilateral actions, and implementing a policy of supporting the revival of Japanese militarist aggressive forces.
　　Let us see what the US government and MacArthur have done in Japan.
　　　　I. Sheltering War Criminals and Releasing War Criminals
　　Delaying the Judgment of War Criminals
　　Regarding the trial of Japanese fascist leaders such as Tojo and twenty-four other war criminals, the US occupation authorities not only allowed these war criminals to use the court as a platform to promote the fascist theory that Japan's war of aggression "was for self-defense," but also specially hired American lawyers to shamelessly defend the war criminals. The trial work has been going on for more than two years, and the final judgment has not yet been issued.
　　Another batch of twenty Class A war criminals who have not been tried, including former Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, Neiji Okamura, former Commander of the South China Expeditionary Army, Ando Kisaburo, former Commander of the North China Expeditionary Army, Tada Shun, former head of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Intelligence Agency, Kodama Yoshio, and five members of the Tojo Cabinet, were proposed for release by Keenan, the US Chief Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal, to the US Army Department War Crimes Group at the end of last year. Due to the pressure of international public opinion, the US military occupation authorities have now released news that they will be tried, but their crimes will be minimized as much as possible, and they will be changed from Class A war criminals to Class B and C war criminals. (According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on June 10)
　　Many important war criminals were released by US reactionaries. For example, Ikeda Seihin, Gogu Kiyoshi, Furuta Toshiyuki, Fujiwara Ginjiro, the top planners of the Japanese war economy, and Ogura Masatsune, the economic advisor to the puppet Wang Jingwei government, were released shortly after being arrested at the end of 1945. Another batch of Class A war criminals, including Ayukawa Yoshisuke, the military industrial magnate who invaded Northeast China, Nakajima Chikuhei, the aircraft king, Kiso Kobayashi, the former Governor-General of Taiwan and president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and Masaki Jinzaburo, an extreme fascist, were "acquitted" on August 30 last year. The next day, Iinosuke Furuno, president of Domei News Agency, and Raisuke Arima, advisor to the Greater Japan Political Association, were also released.
　　Purge work, granting leniency on all sides
　　The so-called "purge" work of war criminals is a farce of "fascists clearing out fascists" (in the words of American journalist David Arnold). MacArthur's headquarters recently announced that the purge work has been completed. But what is its actual content? The blacklist listed 212,846 people, and after the "review," "consideration," and "judgment" of the War Crimes Committee members, only 107 people were deemed "undemocratic." On May 22, MacArthur's headquarters approved the reinstatement of 129 accused war criminals to public office, including Kaname Abeshiro, the chief secretary of the Shidehara Cabinet, Tatsujiro Yunomura, the advisor to the former Oriental Development Corporation (i.e., the joint-stock company) who plundered Chinese resources, Uichiro Yamaike, a former member of the North China Development Corporation, Tsunekichi Ishida, the former assistant manager of the Mengjiang Bank, and Arata Sugihara, the former director-general of the Greater East Asia Ministry and counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing and Shanghai. (According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo)
　　The main culprits of the invasion of China are still invading China
　　Okamura Neji, one of the main culprits of the invasion of China and former commander of the China Expeditionary Army, is still serving as an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing. In Japan, Japanese war criminals who invaded China, such as Kagesa Teizo, the Japanese secret service chief behind the puppet Wang regime, are also allowed to remain at large by the US military occupation authorities, without arrest or extradition. American imperialists are not only actively sheltering war criminals who invaded China, but also actively using their experience in invading China to serve as accomplices in American aggression against China. In early July of last year, the United States brought two ships of Japanese "special immigrants" to Taiwan, including Hasegawa Kiyoshi, the former Governor-General of Taiwan and a Japanese war criminal, Ayukawa Yoshisuke, the former president of the Manchurian Heavy Industries Development Corporation, and other Japanese military, political, and cultural personnel. They were hired by American imperialists to build military bases in Taiwan, develop Taiwan's resources, and assist the United States in training Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. In March of this year, MacArthur introduced Horiuchi Kaneki, a Japanese war criminal who invaded China and former minister to the puppet Nanjing government, and Yamada Tadashi, another financial magnate, as advisors to Song Ziwen, the director of the Pacification Headquarters in South China under the Chiang government.
　　　　II. Supporting Militarism
　　Preserving the Emperor System
　　The Japanese Emperor system is a militarist aggressive organization. During the war, the Emperor used methods such as issuing edicts and making radio speeches to encourage the war of aggression. He was the supreme commander of the Japanese army, and he issued the declaration of war against the United States in the Pacific War. He is directly responsible for the war and should be treated as a war criminal. But MacArthur not only did not treat him as a war criminal or destroy his reactionary influence among the Japanese people, but also respectfully called him "His Majesty," maintaining his prestige among the Japanese people. The new Japanese constitution drafted by MacArthur's headquarters stipulates that "the Emperor, based on the supreme will of the Japanese people, is the symbol of Japan and the unity of the people," and that "the Emperor retains the right of veto over the administrative power of the cabinet." These provisions actually preserve the reactionary Emperor system.
　　Preserving the Monopoly Zaibatsu
　　MacArthur's abstract instructions for "democratic reform" are implemented through the old Japanese reactionary rulers, so it cannot be expected that they will produce truly democratic results. Seven of the nine members of the committee to dissolve the Zaibatsu are either the Zaibatsu themselves or their henchmen. Under their direction, the Zaibatsu's concerns are only divided into several formally "independent" companies, which have no impact on their actual monopoly power. In November of last year, the Japanese Diet formally passed the "Law on the Exclusion of Economic Power Concentration," but in January of this year, the Ashida Cabinet, with MacArthur's consent, decided that the banks of the four major Zaibatsu, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda, would not be "excluded." On May 2, Tokyo newspapers published MacArthur's statement that 194 of the 325 companies listed for dissolution would be removed from the list.
　　Under the protection of the US occupation authorities, the Japanese Zaibatsu who launched the war of aggression not only escaped due punishment, but also bought off political parties, bureaucrats, and politicians, placing their loyal servants and henchmen in the reactionary Japanese Diet and government agencies to protect their interests. In 1946, these Zaibatsu received from the government 45 billion yen in compensation for "wartime losses" from military industries, and another 50 billion yen in compensation for losses of overseas assets.
　　Preserving Fascist Groups
　　The leaders of many well-known fascist groups in pre-war Japan, such as Nissho Inoue, Kozo Tachibana, Tatsuo Amano, Sakichi Mitsui, and Tamao Hishinuma, are still active after the war. During the first post-war general election in Japan in April 1946, Japanese fascists organized 30 to 40 political parties to openly participate in the election. Such as the Japan National Party of the Yoshio Kodama faction, the National Laborers' Alliance and the Constitutional Youth Party of the Ryoichi Isaka faction, as well as the Autonomous Imperial Subjects Association and the Imperial Subjects Front Council. During the period of the planned general strike by Japanese workers in February 1947, members of the New Speech Mass Party led by Yasutomo Maki openly attacked union offices, beat union leaders, and stabbed Katsumi Kikitani, chairman of Japan's most powerful union, the National Congress of Industrial Organizations. These atrocities have not been punished in any way. At the end of 1947, various reactionary fascist groups in Japan, led by the Save the Nation Righteousness Party, organized the National Anti-Communist Groups Council. According to a survey by the Japanese National Police Agency this spring, there are 250 such "right-wing groups" in Tokyo alone, and 1,260 nationwide.
　　Preserving Landlord Power
　　In August 1946, MacArthur, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and other Allied countries, unilaterally approved the "land reform plan" proposed by the reactionary Yoshida Cabinet. According to this plan, the scale of land ownership can only be reduced, and the ownership of the head of the household is transferred to family ownership, but the feudal land ownership relationship cannot be abolished. But even this reform plan has not been seriously implemented. The so-called "Agricultural Land Committee" is actually controlled by the landlords. According to the regulations, 5 million acres of landlord land should have been requisitioned by the end of May last year, but only 900,000 acres were requisitioned by July last year, and all of it fell into the hands of the landlords' relatives. Until this spring, according to a report by the Allied Control Council for Japan, real farmers have not received a single piece of land.
　　　III. Supporting Reactionary Governments in Suppressing Democratic Movements
　　Under MacArthur's "control," the old ruling structure—the Emperor system—was not destroyed, the social and economic system that produced militarism—the Zaibatsu's monopoly and feudal land ownership—was not seriously reformed, and the old reactionary ruling group in Japan has always been in power. The Zaibatsu, bureaucrats, and politicians who cooperated with the military during the war, supported the war, or promoted the war, and even the warlords who launched the war and directly commanded the operations, either hid behind the scenes to manipulate politics, or openly engaged in the so-called "democratic" political arena after the war.
　　The Higashikuni Cabinet, which carried out the surrender, was a purely war criminal cabinet. Higashikuni himself was the commander of the army that captured Wuhan in 1938. During the six weeks that this cabinet was in power, it destroyed and modified the archives of the army and navy, covered up war criminals, concealed crimes, hid huge amounts of military supplies (some of which were later sold on the black market), and enabled various fascist militarist groups to change their faces and preserve themselves.
　　The subsequent four cabinets were all reactionary bureaucratic Zaibatsu cabinets, and none of the cabinet members did not include several war criminal ministers. The Shidehara Cabinet included former Commander of the North China Expeditionary Army, Shimonura Tei, former Commander of the North China Fleet and later Commander of the Combined Fleet, Toyoda Soemu, Secretary-General of the Greater Japan Political Association, Matsumura Kenzo, and Kozo Iwata, advisor to the Koiso Cabinet. The Yoshida Cabinet included Tanzan Ishibashi, a member of the Wartime Planning Board and a member of the Ministry of Finance. The Katayama Cabinet included Rikizo Hirano and Suehiro Nishio (the current Deputy Prime Minister of the Ashida Cabinet), social fascists who deceived Japanese workers and peasants, calling on them to actively produce and support the war. Ashida himself, the current Prime Minister, was the president of the English-language "Japan Times," which published 84 special issues, enthusiastically praising the "Anti-Comintern Pact" and promoting friendship with fascist Germany and Italy, as well as Japan's "new order" in Northeast China.
　　Under such reactionary rule, the Japanese people's democratic movement, which is developing increasingly after the war, has naturally suffered severe oppression. The US military occupation authorities have not only not alleviated this oppression, but have also condoned and encouraged the anti-democratic measures of the Japanese reactionary government, and even directly participated in the suppression of the Japanese people and democratic forces. MacArthur approved the Japanese government to organize secret police to infiltrate trade union organizations to carry out sabotage work in July of the year before last. Demonstrations by Japanese workers or the masses of the people are often interfered with by American military police and troops. MacArthur issued three decrees banning strikes. The first was on May 20 of the year before last, banning the anti-hunger demonstration in Tokyo; the second was on January 31 of last year, banning the general strike of six million people nationwide on February 1; and the third was in March of this year, banning various forms of regional strikes in addition to the general strike. The US Draper economic delegation, which came to Japan in March of this year, even wanted the Ashida government to imitate the US "Taft-Hartley Act," formulate anti-labor laws, ban all strikes, and deprive workers of the right to join unions.
　　Regarding the only party that firmly opposed the Japanese war of aggression during the war—the Japanese Communist Party—MacArthur has condoned the Japanese government in taking various measures of exclusion and restriction, such as expelling JCP members from government agencies. The JCP's "Red Flag" newspaper is often deliberately harassed and restricted by the US military headquarters' censorship personnel. The US military headquarters often spreads rumors and slanders against the JCP, such as propaganda that the JCP wants to "confiscate property by violence." This is just one example of spreading rumors.
　　The Potsdam Declaration stipulates that obstacles to the development of democratic trends among the Japanese people must be removed. Then, the first thing to do is to remove MacArthur's control over Japan.
　　　　IV. Canceling the Reparations Plan
　　Regarding Japan's reparations, the United States has put forward many plans, trying its best to reduce them. The Pauley Plan, published in November of the year before last, allowed Japanese industry to retain the level of 1930-34, stipulating that Japan could produce 2.5 million tons of steel per year; maintain 1.5 million tons of ships, and build 150,000 tons of new ships and repair 3 million tons per year; retain 2,188,000 spindles and 133,000 looms, and may add 3 million spindles and 150,000 looms in the future. Although the Pauley Plan was excessively lenient, it still advocated the demolition of 4,236,600,000 yen (1939 value) of industrial equipment as compensation.
　　The Far Eastern Commission passed a resolution based on the Pauley Plan, specifically pointing out which types of factories should be demolished as compensation and which types of factories could be retained. According to this resolution, MacArthur's headquarters designated 1,090 factories as compensation in August of the year before last. But in December of the year before last, these factories that should have been used as compensation were removed by MacArthur, leaving only 934. The factories that were removed included 113 aircraft factories.
　　Last year, MacArthur put forward a compromise plan, reducing Pauley's compensation amount to 2,466,600,000 yen, which is almost a 40% reduction. As a result, 500 factories were removed from the compensation list, including 24 underground aircraft factories. At the beginning of this year, MacArthur cancelled another 83 factories, followed by another 125 factories shortly after.
　　The Strike Plan, announced in March of this year, further reduced the compensation amount stipulated in MacArthur's compromise plan by 33%. The Draper Plan, announced on May 19, further reduced the compensation to 662,200,000 yen, a 59% reduction compared to the Strike Plan and an 85% reduction compared to the Pauley Plan. This plan also proposed that Japan's overseas assets looted in China and Taiwan should also be used as compensation and offset from the compensation amount of the countries from which they were obtained. In this way, it is equivalent to completely canceling the compensation plan. George Kennan, chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Committee, openly advocated that the United States take unilateral action to stop future compensation. (United Press International, Washington, April 3)
　　Therefore, the "temporary compensation" work decided by MacArthur in April of last year was stopped. At that time, it was stipulated that 30% of the factories on the compensation list would be distributed to China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines first. Due to the deliberate delay of MacArthur's headquarters, the total equipment delivered as the first batch of compensation is still only 80,000 to 100,000 tons. But the United States itself secretly shipped away a large amount of gold, platinum, silver, and precious works of art, hundreds of thousands of tons of rubber, tin, and other materials, as well as hundreds of thousands of tons of raw silk and technical equipment that Japan looted from Eastern countries during the war.
　　　　V. Restoring Economic Aggression
　　The "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is revived
　　The Japanese government's "Five-Year Economic Reconstruction Plan" (published on May 17), drafted according to Draper's principles, plans to increase exports to US$1,646,600,000 by 1952, which is nine times the current export amount, or about three and a half times the export amount in 1937 (the year of the July 7th Incident).
　　Regarding the number of spindles, the Japanese government requested the Draper delegation to restore it to 8 million spindles, but it is rumored that the US government is preparing to restore it to 10 million spindles, which is the level before the "July 7th" war.
　　How much difference is there between this number of 8 million spindles or 10 million spindles and the number of spindles necessary for the lives of the Japanese people? According to the principle of the Allied countries controlling Germany, the living standard of the German people cannot exceed the general living standard of the people in European countries (excluding Britain and the Soviet Union), then the living standard of the Japanese people after the war cannot exceed the living standard of the people in various Far Eastern countries. Among the Far Eastern countries, India has the most developed textile industry, with an average of one spindle for every 33 people. Taking India as an example, the recent population of Japan is 78 million (official statistics), so there can only be 2.4 million spindles. Calculated on the basis of an average consumption of 9.5 yards of cotton per person per year, then the 741 million yards of cloth required by Japan for the whole year (approximately equivalent to Japan's total consumption in 1935) only requires 1.06 million spindles. If there are 1.5 million spindles, there will be enough cotton textiles to export in exchange for the cotton it needs.
　　As for the food problem of the Japanese people, according to Paul, the Australian representative of the Allied Control Council for Japan, in his "Impressions of Japan" published in the March issue of "Pacific" magazine, Japanese farmers are now minimizing their reported harvests in order to avoid paying taxes; and the Japanese government is also underestimating domestic production in order to obtain large amounts of imports. His conclusion is: the Japanese government's food production figures are not credible. "The solution to the Japanese food problem depends on the government and party organizations. In 1946, Japan's domestic food production was quite sufficient, and if it could be properly concentrated and evenly distributed, then famine could be avoided." (June 8, Tianjin Dagong Bao) This passage tells us that making the Japanese people free from hunger is not a matter of expanding exports, but a matter of government organization, in other words, a matter of the democratization of the Japanese government.
　　The purpose of the United States in restoring Japan's export industry is to make Japan its "Asian factory." Jacob, chairman of the American Textile Manufacturers Association, who led the Japanese textile industry survey team, declared after "inspecting" Japan in March of this year: "The United States will help Japan revive its economy and textile industry, and restore its pre-war Asian market and colonial market, no matter what obstacles other Asian countries may create, the United States is determined to do so." One of his entourage even bluntly said: "American raw cotton, capital, and management, Japanese labor, and the Chinese market will be merged into an excellent plan."
　　In order to realize this plan, the United States is preparing to lend Japan 765 million US dollars this year, of which 60 million is a US cotton loan, which has been approved by MacArthur on June 8. With the assistance of MacArthur's headquarters, the Japanese government is preparing to export 100,000 tons of copper products to various Far Eastern countries this year, and more than 4 million yards of clothing made of American cotton will also be exported by Japan, flooding the markets of China and Southeast Asia.
　　In order to transport and sell Japanese goods, in addition to allowing Japan to retain 4 million tons of ships and build 400,000 tons of new ships per year, the Draper delegation also allowed the Japanese Minister of Transportation, Okada Seichi, to meet his demands as much as possible, that is, to lease 30 remaining 10,000-ton Liberty ships to Japan.
　　Making Japan an appendage of the United States under the slogan of "self-sufficiency"
　　The excuse for the United States to help Japan restore its economic aggression is to make the Japanese economy "self-sufficient." So, let's take a look at Japan's foreign trade in the past two years.
　　According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, in Japan's trade last year, the United States accounted for 86% of imports, and the percentage of exports to other countries was 66.8% to East Asian countries and 16.9% to the United States. In the previous year, the United States accounted for 60% of Japan's exports and 100% of imports from the United States. The Japanese market is wide open to the United States, while the US market is closed to Japan. The United States wants to monopolize the Japanese market and contract Japan's imports, for example, in the case of cotton, it is stipulated that 60% of American cotton must be purchased. The United States inputs capital, technology, and some raw materials into Japan, and after manufacturing by cheap Japanese labor, Japan then exports to various East Asian countries.
　　Another excuse for the United States to help Japan is to save the Japanese people from hunger. But according to the Tokyo correspondent of the American "Christian Science Monitor," "the lives and labor of most Japanese workers after the surrender are simply the same as 200 years ago." The reporter pointed out that, as before, Japanese factories and workshops widely used female workers and child laborers. For example, more than 60,000 of the 75,000 workers in the "Kanebo" yarn factory in Osaka are female workers and children aged 12 to 16. Although they work 12 hours like adult male workers, their wages are only 25% to 50% of those of male workers. The feudal contracting system still exists. For example, nearly 140,000 day laborers in Kanagawa Prefecture are still controlled by Matsui, a munitions contractor. More than half of the workers' wages fall into the pockets of the contractor and his accomplices under the name of "commission." If Japan does not have political democracy, the lives of the Japanese people will never be improved. American imperialism, on the one hand, is reviving Japan's fascist forces, and on the other hand, is aiding Japan, obviously not to improve the lives of the Japanese people, but to cultivate Japanese fascist forces.
　　　　VI. Preserving Military Industry
　　The Japanese ships and shipbuilding capabilities that the United States wants to preserve have been mentioned above. As for steelmaking capacity, the Draper Plan allows for 8.5 million tons (the number approved by the Far Eastern Commission is 3.5 million tons), which is 500,000 tons more than Japan's peak wartime production capacity. The levels of other industries, since the full text of the Draper Plan has not been seen, can only be listed according to the Strike Plan, which was published in late February and is more "strict" than the Draper Plan:
　　Thermal power generation:　　　　　　Entirely retained　600,000 kilowatts (according to "World Knowledge" on April 10)
　　Thermal power generation:　　　　　　Entirely retained　220,000 kilowatts
　　Aluminum production:　　　　　　　Retain half　43,000 metric tons
　　Aluminum rolling:　　　　　　　Entirely retained　48,000 metric tons
　　Copper refining:　　　　　　　Entirely retained　70,000 metric tons
　　Copper fabrication:　　　　　　　Entirely retained　135,000 metric tons
　　Machine tool manufacturing (including aircraft factories and armories):
　　　　　　　　　　Entirely retained　(approximately 750,000 machine tools)
　　Bearings:　　　　　　　　Entirely retained
　　Sulfuric acid:　　　　　　　　Entirely retained　4,756,000 metric tons
　　Nitric acid:　　　　　　　　Retain 20%　30,000 metric tons
　　Soda ash:　　　　　　　　Entirely retained　493,000 metric tons
　　Caustic soda (electrolytic):　　　　Entirely retained　129,000 metric tons
　　Synthetic oil:　　　　　　Entirely retained　approximately 110,000 kiloliters
　　Alcohol:　　　　　　　　Entirely retained　approximately 210,000 kiloliters
　　Petroleum refining:　　　　　　Entirely retained　approximately 1,630,000 kiloliters
　　Oil storage facilities:　　　　　　Entirely retained　approximately 1,210,000 kiloliters
　　(The above is translated from the Japanese "Diamond" magazine published in the May 1st issue of "Time and Tide")
　　After the Strike Plan was submitted, the US government, through General Eichelberger, commander of the US Eighth Army and commander of ground forces stationed in Japan, secretly notified companies with direct interests that 125 factories originally listed on the compensation list (including 20 joint manufacturing plants of the steel industry company that manufactured tanks during the war and 45 other enterprises, including a large-scale aircraft manufacturing plant formerly belonging to the Nakajima Zaibatsu) had been exempted from dismantling for compensation by MacArthur and ordered them to formulate technical plans for renovation based on standards that exceeded wartime production by two times. The financial assistance and technical guidance required for the renovation will be provided and supervised by the United States.
　　　　VII. Rearming Japan
　　The Secrets of the "Pioneer Corps"
　　With the tacit approval of MacArthur's headquarters, thousands of former Japanese army, navy, and air force officers took off their uniforms and mixed into the Repatriation Bureau to smoothly disguise a large number of military cadres as "Pioneer Corps," "Fishermen's Associations," or "Cooperative Farms." The American "Baltimore Sun" revealed the fact that an artillery school had become a "cooperative farm." The farm is located in Chiba Prefecture and covers 6,000 acres. The farm staff includes three generals, 17 colonels, 12 lieutenant colonels, 39 majors, 48 captains, 15 commanders, 107 non-commissioned officers, and 231 soldiers. These military organizations under the banners of "farms," "pioneer corps," etc., are obtaining weapons, ammunition, fuel, and food from the so-called "US surplus military supplies" and storing them. At the same time, they are also accumulating funds, waiting for the opportunity to restore the army. Repatriated soldiers have been thoroughly investigated and registered by the Japanese police, and a team can be formed immediately with a simple summons.
　　Expanding the Police Force and Establishing an Army
　　The Japanese police force, which numbered only 65,000 before the war, has been expanded several times. The Japanese government has now admitted that it has 125,000 people. But in fact, it is rumored that there are 300,000 (according to the declaration of 291 celebrities from all walks of life in China and the declaration of 437 professors in Peiping this June). According to Volume 17, Issue 12 of World Knowledge, most of the current police are demobilized soldiers. The highest agency commanding the police, the so-called "National Security Committee" directly under the Prime Minister, is actually a disguised Ministry of the Army. The "police districts" in various places are disguised "military districts." The Police University, established on May 1 this year, is a disguised officers' school or army university.
　　According to a telegram from our agency in Shandong on June 29, a certain expert who recently returned from Japan to our liberated area said that MacArthur recently established an organization in Japan similar to the military department in the past, abbreviated as "ZEB," under the pretext of organizing the police, but secretly assumes the task of recruiting, training, and arming the Japanese army. The Japanese who enlist in the army under the name of police are required to serve for five years and are trained in units of battalions, with 700 to 900 people per battalion. It is expected that 300 battalions will be completed by the end of 1949. In the future, five Japanese battalions and one American battalion will be formed into an "American-Japanese mixed brigade," which will be equipped with artillery, tanks, and other special forces staffed exclusively by American troops.

　　美帝扶日真相
    一九四五年七月二十六日美英中三国向日本发出了波茨顿宣言。苏联参加对日作战后，也在这个宣言上签了字。这个宣言上面所规定的关于日本无条件投降的各项条款，是盟国实施对日政策所应遵循的最高原则。宣言中规定：
    “欺骗及错误领导日本人民，使其妄欲征服世界者之权威及势力，必须永久铲除，因此我们坚持非将负责的军国主义驱出世界，则和平安全及正义的新秩序势不可能。
    ………直至日本制造战争的力量业已毁灭有确实可信的证据时，日本领土，经盟国之指定，必须占领，俾我们在这里陈述的基本目的得以完成。
    ………日本军队在完全解除武装以后，将被允许返其家乡，得有和平及生产生活的机会。
    ………对于战罪人犯，将处以法律的裁判。日本政府必须将阻止日本人民民主趋势的复兴及增强之所有障碍，予以消除。言论、宗教及思想自由以及对于基本人权的重视必须成立。
    日本将被允许维持其经济所必需及可以偿付货物赔款的工业，但可以使其重新武装作战的工业不在其内。”
    这些原则，说得简单些，便是：战犯必须严惩；侵略势力和军国主义，必须永久铲除；日本政府必须实行民主改革；日本人民必须获得民主自由；日本仅允许维持其经济及偿付赔款所必须的工业；战争工业与制造战争的力量必须摧毁；军备武装必须彻底解除；而盟国占领日本的目的，也就是要实现上述许多原则。
    一九四五年十二月莫斯科英美苏三国外长会议，经中国政府同意，决定设立远东委员会（由苏、英、美、中、法、荷、澳、加、印、菲、新西兰参加），为执行波茨顿条款之决策机关，并有权考核占领日本之盟军统帅之指令及各种措施；同时，并决定成立盟国对日委员会（由美、苏、中三国代表及英、澳、新西兰、印度之联合代表参加），规定盟军统帅在颁发重大事项之命令前，须先与该委员会商讨及咨询。该会通称盟国管制委员会。
    麦克阿瑟以盟军最高统帅的身份进驻日本，他的任务，就是彻底实现波茨顿条款；他的对日管制的一切措施应受远东委员会的约束；在“日本宪政结构之基本改组”或“日本政府整个改组”问题上，并受盟国管制委员会一定程度的约束。（据莫斯科三外长会议决议，在上述问题上，如盟国对日管制委员会“委员一人与最高统帅表示异议，最高统帅在远东委员会关于此事未有协议前，应暂绥颁发关于此等问题之命令。”）
    可是，美国政府与麦克阿瑟在日本将近三年的作为，完全与波茨顿宣言的精神背道而驰，并且无视远东委员会与盟国对日管制委员会的权力，无视它们的多次抗议，一贯采取片面行动，实行了扶植日本军国主义侵略势力复兴的政策。
    我们且看美国政府与麦克阿瑟在日本干了些什么。
    　　　　一、庇护战争罪犯释放战争罪犯
    拖延战犯的判决
    对于日本法西斯头子东条等二十五名战犯的审判，美国占领当局不仅听任这些战犯以法庭为讲坛，宣传日本侵略战争“系出于自卫”的法西斯理论，而且特地雇用美籍律师，无耻地替战犯们辩护。审判工作进行了两年有余，最后判决还没有下文。
    其他未予审讯的另外一批二十名一级战犯，包括前中国派遣军总司令西尾寿造、前华南派遣军司令安藤纪三郎、前华北派遣军司令多田骏、前上海日海军特务机关长儿玉誉志夫及东条内阁阁员五名在内，去年底曾由远东国际军事法庭美国首席检查官季南向美陆军部战犯组提议释放。由于国际舆论的压力，现美军占领当局又放出要审讯他们的消息，但他们的罪行将尽量缩小，由一级战犯变成二级三级战犯。（据中央社东京六月十日专电）
    许多重要战犯被美反动派开释。如组织日本战争经济的最高策划者池田成彬、乡古洁、古田俊之助、藤原银次郎以及伪汪精卫政府的经济顾问小仓正恒，一九四五年末拘捕后不久即行释放。而另一批一级战犯，包括侵我东北的军需财阀鲇川义介、飞机大王中岛知久平、前台湾总督和翼赞政治会总裁小林跻造、极端法西斯分子真崎甚三郎等二十三名，竟于去年八月三十日“无罪”释放。次日，同盟社社长古野伊之助和大日本政治会顾问有马赖宁二人也被开释。
    清洗工作，网开三面
    对于战犯的所谓“整肃”工作，是“叫法西斯分子去清除法西斯分子”（美记者大卫·阿诺德语）的滑稽剧。麦克阿瑟总部最近宣布清洗工作已经完成。但其实际内容如何呢？黑名单上开列了廿一万二千八百四十六人，经过战犯委员们的“审查”、“考虑”、“判断”的结果，只剩下一百零七名是“不民主”的了。五月二十二日麦克阿瑟总部即批准了一百二十九名被检举的战犯恢复公职，其中包括币原内阁的书记官长＠桥渡和掠夺中国资源的前东方开发株式会社（即股份公司）顾问汤村达次郎、前华北开发株式会社要员山池卯一郎、前伪蒙疆银行襄理石田恒吉、前大东亚省总务司长兼日驻京沪大使馆参赞杉原荒太等人在内。（据中央社东京专电）
    侵华罪魁，仍在侵华
    侵华罪魁之一前中国派遣军司令网村宁次，仍在南京当蒋介石的顾问。在日本本国侵华战犯，如汪伪政府幕后的日本特务头子影佐桢昭等人，美军占领当局亦任其逍遥法外，不加逮捕和引渡。美国帝国主义者不仅积极地庇护侵华战犯，而且还积极地利用他们侵华的经验，充当美国侵华的帮手。去年七月初，美国便替台湾招来了两船日本“特别移民”，其中包括日战犯前台湾总督长谷川清和前满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介与其他日本军政文化人员。他们被美国帝国主义者聘请前来建造台湾的军事基地，开发台湾的资源，并协助美国来训练蒋匪军队。今年三月，麦克阿瑟又介绍日本侵华要犯、前驻伪宁公使堀内干城及另一名财阀要员山田忠充当蒋政府华南绥靖主任宋子文的顾问。
    　　　　二、扶植军国主义
    保存天皇制度
    日本的天皇制，就是军国主义的侵略机构。天皇在战争期间，用发布诏书、作广播演说等方法，作过许多鼓励侵略战争的活动。他是日本军队的最高统帅，太平洋战争对美国的宣战诏书就是他颁布的，他对战争负有直接责任。应该作为战犯处理。但麦克阿瑟不仅没有把他当作战犯，摧毁他在日本人民中的反动影响，而且还尊称他作“陛下”，保持他在日本人民中的威信。麦克阿瑟总部，草拟的日本新宪法，规定“天皇根据日本国民之最高总意，为日本及国民统一之象征”，“天皇对内阁的行政大权，保留否决之权”。这些规定，实际上保存了反动的天皇制。
    保存独占财阀
    麦克阿瑟的“民主改革”的抽象指令，是通过旧日本的反动统治者去执行的，这就不能期待他们作出真正民主化的结果。解散财阀委员会中的九个委员，其中七个就是财阀自己或财阀的爪牙。在他们主持之下，财阀们的康采仑，仅分散为若干形式上“独立”经营的公司，对其实际的独占权，并无影响。去年十一月日议会形式上通过了“经济力集中排除法”，但今年一月芦田内阁又经麦克阿瑟的同意，决定三井、三菱、住友、安田四大财阀的银行不在“排除”之列，五月二日东京报纸发表了麦克阿瑟的声明，将列入分散名单中之三百二十五家公司，勾消了一百九十四家。
    在美国占领当局的庇护之下，发动侵略战争的日本财阀，不仅逃避了应有的惩罚，而且收买政党、官僚、政客，在反动的日本议会和政府机构中，布置了他们的忠仆和爪牙，保护着他们的利益。在一九四六年，这些财阀就由政府得到了对于军需工业的四百五十亿日圆“战时损失”的补偿费，和另一个对于国外资产损失的五百余亿日圆的补偿费。
    保存法西斯团体
    日本战前许多有名的法西斯团体领导人，如井上日召、橘孝三郎、天野辰夫、满井佐吉、菱沼玉郎等，战后依然在活动。一九四六年四月日本战后第一次大选时，日本法西斯分子组织了卅至四十个政党公开参加竞选。如儿玉誉志夫系的日本国民党、＠川良一系的全国勤劳者同盟和立宪青年党、以及自治皇民会、皇民战线协议会。天皇制奉护同盟等便是。一九四七年二月日本工人准备大罢工的期间，真木康年领导下的新说大众党党员公开袭击工会办公处，殴打工会领袖，并刺伤日本最强大的工会——全国产业别劳动组合协议会——主席听涛克已。这些暴行，并未受到任何惩罚。一九四七年底，日本各反动法西斯团体，由救国立正党领导，组织了全国反共团体协议会。据今春日本警察厅的调查，这种“右翼团体”，仅在东京一地即有二百五十个，在全国则有一千二百六十个。
    保存地主势力
    一九四六年八月，麦克阿瑟不顾苏联和其他盟国的反对，擅自批准了反动的吉田内阁所提出的“土地改革方案”。根据这一方案，只能缩小土地所有的规模，由家长所有转为家族所有，并不能取消封建的土地所有关系。但即使这种改革方案，仍未被认真执行。所谓“农地委员会”，其实权仍操纵于地主之手。按规定至去年五月底应征购之地主土地为五百万英亩，但到去年七月仅征购九十万英亩，且全部落入地主亲属之手。直至今年春天，据盟国对日管制委员会的报告，真正的农民还没有得到一块土地。
    　　　三、支持反动政府镇压民主运动
    在麦克阿瑟的“管制”之下，旧的统治机构——天皇制——没有摧毁，产生军国主义的社会经济制度——财阀的垄断与封建的土地所有——没有认真的改革，日本旧有的反动统治集团仍然一直掌握着政权。就是战时与军部合作、支持战争或鼓吹战争的财阀、官僚、政客，甚至发动战争和直接指挥作战的军阀或则藏于幕后操纵政治，或则公然活动于战后所谓“民主”的政治舞台。
    执行投降的东久迩内阁，是一个纯粹的由战犯组成的内阁，东久迩自己便是一九三八年指挥日军攻陷我武汉的军团长。这个内阁当政的六个星期之内，消灭了和修改了陆海军的档案，掩护了战犯，隐蔽了罪行，藏匿了巨量军火物资（后来有一部分在黑市抛售），并使各种法西斯军国主义集体改头换面，保存下来。
    其后的四届内阁，都是反动的官僚财阀内阁，内阁人员中，没有一届不包含若干战犯大臣。币原内阁中有前华北派遣军司令下村定、前华北舰队司令及其后的联合舰队司令丰田副武、大日本政治会干事长松村谦三、小矶内阁顾问岩田宙造等。吉田内阁中有战时企划院委员及大藏省委员石桥湛三等。片山内阁中有欺骗日本工农，叫他们积极生产支持战争的社会法西斯分子平野力三和西尾末广（现芦田内阁副首相）等。现内阁首相芦田本人，曾是英文“日本时报”社社长，出版过八十四种特辑，热烈赞扬“反共协定”，宣传对法西斯德国和意大利的亲善，以及日本在我东北的“新秩序”。
    在这样的反动统治之下，战后日益发展的日本人民民主运动，自然遭受到严重的压迫。美军占领当局不仅没有减轻这种压迫，而且纵容鼓励日本反动政府的反民主措施，甚至自己也直接参加了对日本人民与民主力量的镇压。麦克阿瑟前年七月曾经批准日政府组织秘密警察打入工会组织中去作破坏工作。日本工人或人民群众的示威，常常受到美国宪兵和军队的干涉。麦克阿瑟颁布过三次禁止罢工的法令，第一次是前年五月二十日，禁止东京的反饥饿示威；第二次是去年一月三十一日，禁止二月一日全国六百万人的总罢工；第三次是今年三月，除总罢工外，又禁止各种形式的地域性罢工。今年三月间到日本的美国德莱柏经济代表团，甚至要芦田政府做效美国的“塔夫脱——哈特莱法案”，制订反劳工法，取缔一切罢工，剥夺工人参加工会的权利。
    对于在战时唯一坚决反对日本侵略战争的政党——日本共产党，麦克阿瑟纵容日本政府采取各种排斥和限制的措施，如自政府机关中开除日共党员等。日共“红旗报”经常受到美军总部新闻检查人员的故意刁难和限制。美军总部时常造谣诬蔑日共，如宣传日共要以“暴力没收财产”。就是造谣之一例。
    波茨顿宣言规定，日本人民民主趋势发展的障碍，必须清除。那么，首先就应当清除麦克阿瑟的对日管制。
    　　　　四、取消赔偿计划
    关于日本的赔偿，美国提出过好些方案，竭力设法把它减少。前年十一月发表的鲍莱计划，允许日本工业可保留一九三○——三四年的水准，规定日本每年可生产钢铁二百五十万吨；保有船舶一百五十万吨，每年可造新船十五万吨，修理三百万吨；保存现有纱锭二百十八万八千枚，织机十三万三千架，将来可能再增加纱锭三百万枚，织机十五万架，虽然鲍莱此案已过分宽大，但毕竟还主张拆迁四十二亿三千六百万日圆（一九三九年的价值）的工业设备，充作赔偿。
    远东委员会根据鲍莱计划通过了一个决议，具体指出那些种类的工厂应该拆毁，充作赔偿，那些种类的工厂才能保留。根据这个决议，前年八月麦克阿瑟总部指定了一千另九十座工厂充作赔偿。可是到了前年十二月，这些应当充作赔偿的工厂就被麦克阿瑟删掉了一批，只剩下九百三十四所。被删去的工厂中包括一百十三所飞机工厂。
    去年麦克阿瑟又提出了折衷的方案，将鲍莱的赔偿额削减至二十四亿六千六百万日圆，即几乎削减了百分之四十。于是，赔偿名单中又被删掉了五百家工厂，其中包括二十四所地下飞机工厂。今年初，麦克阿瑟再勾消了八十三家工厂，接着不久又勾掉了一百二十五家工厂。
    今年三月公布的斯揣克计划，又将麦克阿瑟的折衷方案所规定的赔偿额再减低了百分之三十三。而五月十九日发表的德莱柏计划，则又把赔偿削减为六亿六千二百万日圆，比斯揣克计划减少百分之五十九，比鲍莱计划减少百分之八十五。这个计划并且提出日本前在中国、台湾所掠夺的国外资产，亦应充作赔偿品，并自所得国家之赔偿额中抵消。这样一来，就等于完全取消了赔偿计划。美国国务院政策设计委员会主席凯南，就公开主张美国采取片面行动，停止今后的赔偿。（合众社华盛顿四月三日电）
    因此，去年四月麦克阿瑟所决定的“临时赔偿”工作，便告停止。当时规定从列入赔偿名单的工厂中提出百分之卅，先行分配与中、英、荷、菲四国。这个工作由于麦克阿瑟总部的故意拖延，迄今已交付第一批作赔偿品的设备，总共还不过八万吨到十万吨。但美国自己却在占领初期私自运走日本战时自东方各国掠夺得来的大量黄金、白金、银子和珍贵的艺术品、数十万吨橡皮、锡和其他物资，以及数十万吨生丝和技术装备。
    　　　　五、恢复经济侵略
    “东亚共荣圈”借尸还魂
    根据德莱柏的原则所草拟的日本政府“经济复兴五年计划”（五月十七日发表），拟于一九五二年将输出提高到十六亿四千六百万美元，为目前输出额之九倍，亦即约为一九三七年（七七事变的一年）输出额之三倍半。
    纺锤锭数，日政府曾向德莱柏代表团要求恢复到八百万锭，但近传美国政府准备给它恢复到一千万锭，即“七七”战前之水平。
    这个八百万锭或一千万锭的数目，和日本人民生活所必需的锭数，相差有多大呢？按照盟国管制德国的原则，德国人民生活水准不能超过欧洲（英、苏除外）国家一般人民生活之上，那么，战后日本人民生活水准亦不能超过远东各国人民生活水准。远东各国，以印度纺织业最发达，平均每三十三人有一个纺锭。如以印度为例，日本人口最近为七千八百万（官方统计），则只能有二百四十万锭。如以每人每年平均消费棉花九码半计算，则日本全年所需之七亿四千一百万码布匹（约相当于日本一九三五年之总消费量），只需一百另六万锭便够了。如果有一百五十万锭，则有足够的棉织品输出，以换回其所需之棉花。
    至于日本人民的粮食问题，据盟国对日委员会澳洲代表鲍尔在“太平洋”杂志三月号发表的“日本杂感”称，现在日本农民尽量少报收获量，以逃避缴出；而日本政府也尽量低估国内生产量，以获得大量输入。他的结论是：日本政府的粮食生产数字是不可信的。“日本粮食问题的解决，当依政府党政机构而定。一九四六年日本国内粮食的生产相当充足，如能予以适当的集中而作平均的分配，那么，饥荒是可以避免的。”（六月八日津大公报）这段话就告诉我们：使日本人民免于饥饿，不是扩大输出的问题，而是政府机构问题，换句话说，就是日本政府民主化的问题。
    美国恢复日本输出工业的目的，就在把日本作成其“亚洲工厂”，美国纺织业联合会主席杰可勃领导的日本纺织业调查团，于今年三月间“视察”日本后宣称：“美国协助日本复兴经济及纺织工业，并恢复其战前的亚洲市场及殖民地市场，不论其他亚洲国家将造成何种障碍，美国志在必行。”他的一个随员甚至露骨地说：“美国的原棉、资本及管理，日本的广大劳力，再加上中国的市场，将合并为一极好的计划。”
    为实现这个计划，美国准备在今年内贷与日本七亿六千五百万美元，其中六千万为美棉贷款，已于六月八日由麦克阿瑟批准，在麦克阿瑟总部援助之下，日本政府本年内准备以十万吨铜制品输往远东各国，而四百余万码由美棉制成的服装，亦将由日本输出，充斥于中国和南洋的市场。
    为着运销日货，德莱柏代表团除允许日本保有船舶四百万吨并年造新船四十万吨外，并允许尽量满足日运输大臣冈田势一所提的要求。即租予日本剩余的万吨自由轮三十艘。
    在“自给自足”口号下，使日本成为美国的附庸
    美国扶助日本恢复经济侵略的借口，是使日本经济“自给自足”。那么，我们且看过去两年日本对外贸易的情况。
    据日本政府商工省调查，去年日本全年贸易，输入中美国占百分之八十六，输出别国所占百分比，计东亚各国占百分之六十六点八，美国占百分之十六点九。而前年日本输出，美国占百分之六十，输入美国占百分之百。日本市场对美国大开其门，而美国市场却对日关门。美国要独占日本市场，包办日本的输入，例如棉花一项，规定必须购用美棉百分之六十。美国以资本、技术兼以一部原料输入日本，经过日本低廉劳力的制造，由日本再输出东亚各国。
    美国扶助日本的另一个借口，是为了使日本人民免于饥饿。但据美国“基督教科学箴言报”驻东京记者报导，“投降后多数日本工人的生活与劳动，简直同二百年前一样。”该记者指出，和从前一样，日本的工厂与工场广泛地利用了女工和童工。例如大阪“钟纺”纱厂七万五千工人中有六万以上是女工和十二岁至十六岁未成年的童工。虽然他们和男子成年工人一样工作十二小时，但他们的工资只有男工的百分之二十五到百分之五十。封建性的包工制仍然存在。例如神奈川县近十四万名的日庸工人，照旧由一个军火包工者松井控制着。工人半数以上的工资，在所谓“佣金”的名义下，落入了包工者及其同伙的口袋里。如果日本没有政治的民主，日本人民的生活永远无法改善。美国帝国主义一面复活日本的法西斯势力，一面援助日本，显然不是为了改善日本人民的生活，而是为了培养日本法西斯势力。
    　　　　六、保存军事工业
    美国所欲保存的日本船舶和造船能力，上面已经说过。至于炼钢能力，德莱柏计划中所允许的为八百五十万吨（远东委员会通过之数目为三百五十万吨），较日本战时最高生产能力还超过了五十万吨。其他工业水平，因未见德莱柏计划的全文，只能根据二月下旬发表的，比德莱柏计划较为“严格”的斯揣克计划，列举如下：火力发电　　　　　　全部保留　六十万千瓦时（据四月十日"世界知识"）火力发电　　　　　　全部保留　二十二万千瓦时铝生产　　　　　　　保留一半　四万三千公吨铝压延　　　　　　　全部保留　四万八千公吨铜精炼　　　　　　　全部保留　七万公吨铜精制　　　　　　　全部保留　十三万五千公吨工作机械制造（包括飞机工厂兵工厂在内）
　　　　　　　　　　全部保留　（约有工作母机七十五万架）轴承　　　　　　　　全部保留硫酸　　　　　　　　全部保留　四百七十五万六千公吨硝酸　　　　　　　　保留百分之廿　三万公吨灰咸　　　　　　　　全部保留　四十九万三千公吨烧咸（电解）　　　　全部保留　十二万九千公吨人造石油　　　　　　全部保留　约十一万＠（千公升）酒精　　　　　　　　全部保留　约二十一万＠石油精炼　　　　　　全部保留　约一百六十三万＠储油设备　　　　　　全部保留　约一百二十一万＠
　　（以上据五月一日“时与潮”所载日本“金钢钻”杂志的译文）
    斯揣克计划书提出之后，美国政府即经由美第八军军长、驻日地面部队总司令艾契柏秘密向有直接利益关系的公司通知：原被列入赔偿名单之一百二十五个工厂（包括战时担任制造坦克的钢铁产业公司的二十个联合制造厂和其他四十五个企业，其中又包括前属×岛财阀的大规模飞机制造厂），已经麦克阿瑟决定免予拆卸作赔偿之用，并令其根据超过战时生产量两倍的标准，拟订改装的技术方案。改装所需要的财政援助与技术指导，都将由美国供给和督率。
    　　　　七、重新武装日本
    “开拓团”的秘密
    在麦克阿瑟总部默许之下，数千名前日本陆、海、空军将校脱下了军装，混入复员局工作，顺利地将大量军事干部用“开拓团”、“渔民协会”、或“合作农场”等伪装掩蔽起来。美国“巴尔的摩太阳报”揭露了一所炮兵学校变成“合作农场”的事实。该农场在千叶县，占地六千英亩。农场职员中计有三名将军、十七名大佐、十二名中佐、卅九名少佐、四十八名大尉、十五名队长、一百零七名下士、二百卅一名士兵。在这些“农场”、“开拓团”等等招牌之下的军事组织，正在从所谓“美国剩余军需物资”中取得武器、弹药、燃料和食品等，并将这些东西储存起来。同时也在积存经费，等待着恢复军队的时机到来。复员军人均经日本警察的详细调查与登记，只要一下召集令，立刻就可以组成一支队伍。
    扩充警察，建立陆军
    战前仅有六万五千人之日本警察，屡经扩大，现日本政府已承认有十二万五千人。但实际据传已有三十万（据今年六月中国各界名流二百九十一人宣言及北平教授四百三十七人的宣言）。据世界知识十七卷十二期载称，现有警察大部分系复原军人。而指挥警察的最高机构，即直辖首相的所谓“国家保安委员会”，实为变相的陆军省。各地“警管区”，则为变相的“军管区”。本年五月一日成立的警政大学，乃是变相的士官学校或陆军大学。
    另据本社山东六月二十九日电，最近由日本归国抵达我解放区之某专家谈，麦克阿瑟近在日本成立一类似过去军部之机构，简称“ＺＥＢ”，借口组织警察，实则密任征召、编训与武装日本陆军的任务。现在以警察名义入伍的日人，规定服役期为五年，以营为单位进行训练，每营七百至九百人，预期一九四九年底将完成三百个营。将来以五个日本营及一个美国营编成“美日混成旅”，并将配备以专由美军担任的炮兵、战车、及其他特种部队。
    借口缉私，重建海军
    海军方面，麦克阿瑟借口防止海上走私，本年初已将指定赔偿盟国之驱逐舰、潜水艇二十八艘交与日警使用。四月麦克阿瑟又不顾盟国舆论的反对，擅自准许日寇成立“海上保安厅”，拨予巡逻舰三十八艘，武装警员八千名。据四月五日东京新亚社电称：为避免国际舆论之攻击，该厅暂设于运输省编制之内，将来再谋扩大改组，而直隶于内阁。此种海上武装，拥有特级舰等一百二十五艘，共五万余吨。另据“世界知识”十七卷十二期载道：五月一日日政府成立“中央海上保安委员会”和“海上保安厅”，就是变相的海军省。各港口所设的“地方保安委员会”“海上保安部”以至“海上保安分部”，则类似过去的“镇守府”和“要港部”。加之日本造船炼钢水准，已为美国提高，重建舰队，并非难事。
    至于海军基地，横须贺、佐世保、吴港等日本三大军港完好如昔，而且还加以扩充，增添了美国的新式技术装备。其他所有海军基地，据说三年内即将完全修复。
    训练空军，建筑机场
    空军方面，日本神风队的自杀航空队员，去年早有运至美国受训的消息，空军地面勤务人员及无线电员，亦由美占领军招募训练。关于建筑机场的报导更多。美国正在日本本土实现一个庞大的空军基地网计划。最新式的机场及其相应的兵营、军火仓库、军用公路等正在到处修建，原有的机场，有的已加扩充，有的已加修整，已经辟作农场的机场现又重新修建。例如最近美军占领当局所承认在日本本州北部青森建立之具大机场，有九千五百英尺长的跑道（其中八千五百英尺系用钢骨水泥筑的），可供现在美国建造中之最大巨型机使用。此飞机场已动工年余，有数千日人从事建筑，需费用一千三百万美元。现已完成工程的百分之六十，预期在年底方能竣工。占日本预算百分之四十到五十的所谓“占领军费”，实际上就是建筑基地的费用。据去年十一月六日日本经济安定本部长官和田博雄告日众院预算委员会称：日本重要建筑原料百分之三十已为占领军所征用。（未完）
