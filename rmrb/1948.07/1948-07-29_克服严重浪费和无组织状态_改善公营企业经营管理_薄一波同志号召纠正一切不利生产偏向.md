　　Overcoming Serious Waste and Disorganization
    Improving the Operation and Management of Public Enterprises
  　Comrade Bo Yibo Calls for Correcting All Production-Detrimental Tendencies
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The North China Industry and Commerce Conference appropriately assessed the significant achievements of public factories in the North China region in supporting military and civilian needs, but also sharply criticized the serious phenomenon of poor operation and management in current public enterprises, believing that improving operation and management is the most urgent problem to be solved for public enterprises to further improve production.
    The conference pointed out that the first serious shortcoming in current operation and management is serious waste and a state of anarchy and indiscipline. For example, the Taihang Industrial Company decided to mine coal in a certain area without any detailed survey by engineers and without knowing whether there was a coal seam in the area or how thick the coal seam was. It did not seek approval from the border region government in advance, and it blindly started work without considering its own technical conditions. It was not until a large amount of manpower and materials were consumed and two hundred million yuan were wasted that it was discovered that the coal seam in the area was very shallow and mining could not be successful at all. The Beiyue Administrative Office formulated a huge ×× coal mine mining plan without engineer surveys and signatures and without approval from higher authorities. It has already invested 320 million yuan and is requesting continued investment of 1.8 billion yuan. According to expert research, this mine will not have much of a future due to the shallow coal seam. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Industry Department did not realistically solicit the opinions of engineers and did not pay attention to geological conditions, and rashly proceeded to build air-raid shelters, resulting in many collapses and a waste of 400 to 500 million yuan. Phenomena like this were very common in public enterprises in the past. The conference pointed out that this kind of irresponsible bureaucracy and anarchy and indiscipline must be resolutely corrected in the future, and strict disciplinary sanctions must be enforced if it happens again. It also proposed that in the future, the establishment of factories, the relocation of factories, and the implementation of projects must be subject to detailed investigation, research, and design, and must be implemented only after being signed by certain technicians and engineers and approved by higher authorities. A request has been made to the North China government to formulate regulations and discipline for this.
    The second serious shortcoming in operation and management is the serious phenomenon of destruction in many factories taken over by public enterprises. For example, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Industry Department destroyed seven air compressors in order to use cylinders; many factories destroyed entire complete machines in order to use the parts of the machines; some factories, when handing over machines to other factories, retained some machine parts that were useful to them, causing all the machines to be damaged; some departments, after taking over factories, did not start work on the spot, but dismantled the machines and moved them away separately. The conference severely criticized this behavior of destroying industry and destroying production, and stipulated that all factories and mines in newly liberated cities must be strictly prohibited from being transferred or destroyed, and must be preserved in their original state and started on the spot. Even if the city is to be withdrawn by our army shortly after its occupation due to strategic reasons, no destruction is allowed at all, because these factories are the wealth of the people and will soon return to the people. The conference decided to properly protect all private factories and mines and help them start production. In the future, except for those that are absolutely necessary for military purposes, no other destruction will be allowed.
    The third serious shortcoming in operation and management is the "bureaucratization" and "militarization" of factories in terms of organization and style. There are too many non-production personnel in factories, the establishment is too large, no attention is paid to cost accounting, no importance is attached to profits and losses, and the standard for using cadres is not technical and work ability, but "qualifications" and so-called "political conditions"; or it does not proceed from enterprise production, but from the point of view of relief. The conference stipulated that all factories must be industrialized in the future, must implement a strict economic accounting system, strengthen production organization, dismiss all unnecessary non-production personnel, and abolish the system of orderlies and special agents brought from the army and organs. In the future, the employment of personnel and administration must be based on technology as the standard, and everything must proceed from technology. Except for special agents and saboteurs, all technical personnel must be given a free hand. The conference pointed out that politics in the factory is to develop production, and there is no abstract politics other than production. Many cadres in the factory who do not understand technology must work hard to learn technology, otherwise he cannot continue to do a good job in the factory, and finally he will have to leave the factory and let others who have technology and can do a good job in production replace him.
    The conference passed a draft of economic discipline for public factories and sent it to the two border region governments for approval and implementation. The draft stipulates that a resolute struggle must be launched ideologically and organizationally against the current state of indiscipline and disorganization in production, operation, and management of public factories, and the serious waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources caused by departmentalism, liberalism, and bureaucracy. The strengths must be promoted, and the shortcomings must be corrected, and our public enterprises must be pushed forward with a high degree of loyalty to the country and the people. In the draft of economic discipline, specific measures are stipulated to establish a commendation system, a performance appraisal system, and incentives to reward inventions, technological improvements, and all individuals and units that improve production; specific methods are stipulated to resolutely eliminate all wasteful phenomena, practice strict economy, and hold accountable and punish those who manage improperly, neglect their duties, privately transfer property, or dismantle and sell machines without approval. The draft discipline stipulates the establishment of a strong, unified, and centralized leadership concept, and opposes localism and liberalism. In the future, all production plans, production tasks, and financial revenue tasks of all public factories shall be uniformly stipulated and executed by the highest-level government, and no factory leading organ shall be allowed to change them without authorization.
    In the conclusion of the conference, Comrade Bo Yibo emphasized this issue: The biggest shortcoming of our public enterprises now is that they do not know how to operate and manage, so in order to build industry, we must learn how to manage enterprises. This is a task for the Party and all those engaged in public enterprise work. He also proposed: Who should we learn from? It is obviously wrong to learn from our own tradition of managing factories, because the small factories we established in the long-term decentralized rural guerrilla warfare environment, like our army, adopted the supply system. All the operation and management methods of the factories followed the tradition of the supply system. This system played a positive role in the past and was completely correct, but it is no longer feasible to use this system to manage factories now. It has already produced great harm, "whether you work or not, it's the same pay." It can no longer develop productive forces. The old technicians and expert engineers, however, oppose our supply system and are unwilling to work in our factories. Therefore, we must change the "tradition of the supply system" and replace it with operation and management methods that can develop production. Since we have no such legacy to inherit and it is impossible to go to distant overseas countries to learn, we have no choice but to learn from the existing Chinese bourgeoisie. They have decades of technology and experience in managing factories. We must learn all the scientific and rational parts of their production management, economic accounting, and labor organization, and only modify some of the excessively outdated parts that suppress workers and are harmful to production development. Comrade Bo Yibo finally called on all comrades engaged in public industry to fight against all tendencies unfavorable to production. The first is to oppose agricultural socialism in industry, such as egalitarianism in wage policies, decentralization that adapts to local backwardness, and the "poor peasant perspective," "relief perspective," and "humanitarianism" in the employment of personnel and administration that do not proceed from the point of view of production and revolution. All abstract "political conditions" and "seniority" in factories that do not focus on developing productive forces and deviate from developing productive forces should be quickly corrected, and technology and scientific operation and management should be learned.

### 克服严重浪费和无组织状态  改善公营企业经营管理　薄一波同志号召纠正一切不利生产偏向

　　克服严重浪费和无组织状态
    改善公营企业经营管理
  　薄一波同志号召纠正一切不利生产偏向
    【本报讯】华北工商业会议适当的估计了华北区公营工厂支持军需民用之重大成绩，但也尖锐地批评了目前公营企业经营管理不善的严重现象，认为改善经营管理，是目前公营企业进一步提高生产最迫切需要解决的问题。
    会议指出目前经营管理中第一个严重的缺点是严重的浪费和无政府无纪律状态。如太行实业公司决定在某地开采煤矿，根本没有经过工程师的详细勘察，并不知道该地有无煤层，煤层多厚，事前亦未经过边区政府批准，又不根据自己的技术条件，就盲目地动起工来，直至消耗了大量的人力物力，浪费了两亿元之后，才发觉该地煤层很浅，开采根本不能成功。北岳行署未经工程师勘察和签字未经上级批准就制定了庞大的××煤矿开采计划，现已投资三亿二千万元，还要求继续投资十八亿元。根据专家研究，此矿亦因煤层很浅，不会有多大前途。晋冀鲁豫军工部不切实征询工程师的意见，不注意地质条件，即冒然进行打防空洞，结果坍了很多，浪费至四五亿元之巨。象这类现象，过去在公营企业中是很普遍的。大会指出这种对人民不负责任的官僚主义和无政府无纪律的现象，今后必须坚决纠正，如果再犯，必须严格执行纪律制裁。并提出今后设厂移厂举办工程必须经过详细调查研究设计，经过一定的技师工程师签字和上级核准，始准实行。对此已请求华北政府制定规程和纪律。
    经营管理的第二个严重的缺点就是在由公营企业所接收的许多工厂中，存在着严重的破坏现象。如晋冀鲁豫军工部为了使用汽缸，破坏了七个空气压缩机；许多工厂为了使用机器的零件而破坏了整个完整的机器，有些工厂在交出机器给其他工厂时，保留下一部分对他们自己有用的机器零件而使全部机器损毁；有的部门在接收工厂后，不去就地开工，而把机器拆卸分散搬走。会议严厉的指摘了这种破坏工业、破坏生产的行为，规定以后新解放城市的一切工矿，一律严禁转移，严禁破坏，必须保存原状，就地开工。即使由于战略关系，我军在占领后不久又要退出的城市也不许丝毫破坏，因为这些工厂都是人民的财富，不久又将重归人民所有。会议决定对于一切私人工矿都要妥为保护，帮助开工生产。今后除了军事上十分必要者外，其他任何破坏，都不允许。
    经营管理第三个严重的缺点就是工厂在组织上，作风上的“机关化”，“军队化”。工厂中非生产人员太多，编制太庞大，不注意成本计算，不重视盈亏，使用干部不以技术及工作能力为标准，而以“资格”、及所谓“政治条件”为标准；或者不从企业生产出发，而是从救济观点出发。会议规定今后一切工厂必须企业化，必须实行严格的经济核算制度，加强生产组织，解雇一切无必要的非生产人员，取消由军队中机关上带来的勤务员、特务员等制度，今后用人行政，一定要以技术为标准，一切从技术出发，除了特务分子破坏分子以外，一切有技术的人员都要放手使用。大会指出在工厂中的政治就是发展生产，除了生产以外，没有什么抽象的政治。现在工厂中许多不懂技术的干部，都必须努力学习技术，否则他就不能在工厂中继续做好工作，最后只好让他离开工厂，让别的有技术的能做好生产工作的人来代替他。
    会议通过了公营工厂经济纪律草案送请两个边区政府核准实施。草案规定对目前公营工厂在生产、经营、管理上的无纪律无组织状态，及由于本位主义、自由主义、官僚主义所造成的严重的人力、物力、财力的浪费，必须从思想上、组织上展开坚决的斗争，发扬长处，改正缺点，以高度的对国家对人民的忠诚，把我们的公营企业推向前进。在经济纪律草案中，具体规定了建立褒奖制度，考功考勤制度，奖励创造发明，奖励提高技术，提高生产的一切个人与单位；规定了坚决消灭一切浪费现象的具体办法，厉行节约，凡管理不当，玩忽职守，私相授受，不经批准自行拆毁变卖机器者，一律追究责任，加以惩处。纪律草案规定树立强有力的统一集中的领导观念，反对地方主义与自由主义。今后所有公营工厂之一切生产计划、生产任务及财政收益任务，均由最高级政府统一规定执行，任何工厂领导机关不得擅自更改。
    在大会结论中，薄一波同志曾就此问题强调指出：现在我们公营企业的最大缺点，就是不会经营，不会管理，因此为了建设工业，就必须学习如何管理企业，这是党和所有从事公营企业工作者的一个任务。他又提出：我们应该向谁学习呢？向我们自己管理工厂的传统学习吧，显而易见是不对的，因为我们在长期的分散的农村游击战争环境下所建立的小型工厂，都如同我们的军队一样是采取的供给制度，工厂的一切经营管理方法，都是随着供给制度的传统而来，这个制度在过去曾经起过积极作用，曾经是完全正确的，但现在再用这个制度来管理工厂就不行了，它已经产生很大弊害，“干不干二斤半”，它已经不能发展生产力了。而旧的技术工人和专家工程师，却都反对我们的供给制而不愿在我们工厂中工作。因此，必须改变“供给制传统”，代之以能够发展生产的经营管理方法。我们既没有此种遗产可以继承，又不可能到遥远的海外去学习，这就使我们不得不向现有的中国的资产阶级学习，他们已经有了几十年管理工厂的技术与经验，我们要学习他们在生产管理、经济核算、劳动组织上的一切科学的合理的部分，而仅仅修改一些过份陈旧的、压制工人的、对生产发展有害的部分。薄一波同志最后号召全体从事公营工业的同志们要与一切不利于生产的偏向作斗争，首先就是反对工业中的农业社会主义，如工资政策中的平均主义，适应地方落后性把机器分散的分散主义，用人行政不从生产观点、革命观点出发的“贫雇观点”“救济观点”“人道主义”，以及在工厂中一切不讲求发展生产力离开发展生产力的抽象的“政治条件”“老资格”等，均应迅速的加以纠正学习技术，学会科学的经营管理。
