　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to news from the United States Information Service and newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: The Guangzhou and Shaoguan (Northern Guangdong) training centers, belonging to the Chiang Kai-shek Defense Ministry's Army Training Command, have been formally established under the command of the U.S. Military Advisory Group. The U.S. Advisory Group announced that a U.S. advisory team headed by Colonel Bowling left Nanjing for Guangzhou on the first of this month. The team includes three officers, two soldiers, and one engineer, and will later increase to eleven officers and eight soldiers. It is said that in addition to being responsible for "planning" and "guiding" the training work of Chiang's army, they also have the right to "provide opinions on the administrative affairs of the division headquarters" of the Chiang army divisions being trained. The work of the Shaoguan training center is directly supervised by U.S. advisors Lieutenant Colonel Lindner and Major Siesel, who arrived in Shaoguan on May 4th. According to the Army Training Conference convened by Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing in mid-January this year, with the participation and hosting of three American advisors, it was decided, in accordance with the "recommendations" of Rooks, the former head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, to establish more than ten "training centers," of which the training centers in Taiwan, Beiping, Dihua and other places have been established one after another. All these training institutions have American personnel participating in and presiding over them. Brigadier General David Barr, head of the U.S. Advisory Group, admitted in a statement in Nanjing on the first of this month that the group has sent a total of six advisory teams to work in various places, including fifteen officers and twelve soldiers in Taiwan, seven officers and five soldiers in Beiping, twelve officers and four soldiers in Chengdu, and a Air Force team of eight officers and three soldiers in Hangzhou. It is understood that the various American advisory teams have full supervisory power over the training of Chiang's army.
