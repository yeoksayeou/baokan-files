Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th—Reports from various sources: Under pressure from the U.S. Congress to "cut aid," the governments of Western European countries participating in the "Marshall Plan" have successively signed "bilateral agreements" with the United States that are humiliating and detrimental to their sovereignty. The "bilateral agreements" between the United States and France, Italy, and Ireland were signed in Paris, Rome, and Dublin on June 28th. The content of the U.S.-France agreement has not been made public, but according to a communiqué from the Economic Research Office of the French General Confederation of Labor, its provisions include France allowing the United States the privilege of obtaining strategic resources from France; transferring certain French industrial development plans (especially coal production) to the U.S. Marshall Plan Administration for approval; the U.S. government retaining the right to demand devaluation of the French franc; the French government establishing a franc fund equivalent to the value of the U.S. loan, controlled by the U.S. government; and the French government must implement the trade policies formulated at the Geneva and Havana conferences. In the protocol signed at the same time, France also recognized West Germany as its most-favored nation. The content of the U.S.-Italy bilateral agreement, which has not yet been made public, was described by the U.S. State Department as "representative." In a special protocol, Italy and Ireland also recognized the condition of "granting most-favored-nation treatment in trade to West Germany, Japan, and South Korea." On the 29th, the United States signed "bilateral agreements" with the United Kingdom and Norway. According to semi-official British sources, the United Kingdom guaranteed in the agreement to supply the United States with rare materials and extended the most-favored-nation clause to West Germany and the American-occupied zone of Trieste, with the issue of Japan being left for later discussion. During the negotiation of these "bilateral agreements," the United States adopted blatant coercive measures to force Western European countries to quickly sign and pass the agreements. According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch on the 28th, quoting a State Department spokesman, "After July 3rd, any recipient country must sign a bilateral agreement before receiving assistance under the European Recovery Program." British officials also admitted on the 26th that "U.S. material transportation will be interrupted from July 3rd until the British Parliament approves the treaty" (Agence France-Presse). Therefore, although the authorities of Western European countries had expressed opposition to the U.S. draft agreement's "tone being too dictatorial"; "some clauses are one-sided, for example, the term of the treaty's restrictions on recipient countries is four years, while the U.S. side decides annually"; "some places in the draft agreement even exceed the provisions of the Havana International Trade Organization Charter, which no country has signed" (all according to Reuters dispatch on June 10th); and the United Kingdom was even afraid that "the current draft agreement would give the United States the right to change the pound exchange rate without consulting with the United Kingdom in advance" (London broadcast on June 10th); they still shamefully succumbed to the will of U.S. imperialism.

　　西欧各国反动政府丧权辱国
    与美签订“双边协定”
    【新华社陕北五日电】各方报导：在美国国会“削减援助”的压力下，参加“马歇尔计划”的西欧各国政府，已相继与美国签订了丧权辱国的“双边协定”，美国与法国、意大利、爱尔兰之间的“双边协定”于六月二十八日在巴黎、罗马与都柏林签字。在内容并未公布的美法协定中，据法国总工会经济研究处的公报指出，它的条款包括法国允许美国有自法国获取战略资源的特权；将法国某些工业发展计划（特别是煤的生产）交由美国马歇尔计划执行局批准；美政府保有要求法郎贬值的权利；法政府应设立相当于所得美贷价格之法郎基金，由美政府控制之；法政府必须执行日内瓦及哈瓦那会议所制订之贸易政策。在同时签订的议定书中，法国并承认了西德是它的最惠国。内容尚未公布的美意双边协定，被美国国务院形容为“具有代表性”。在特别议定书中，意爱两国并承认了“对西德、日本及南鲜在贸易上实行最惠国待遇”的条件，二十九日、美国与英国、挪威签订了“双边协定”。据英国半官方人士透露，英国在协定中曾保证以稀有物资供给美国，并将最惠国条款扩及西德与的里雅斯特的美国占领区，仅扩及日本问题留待以后讨论。在这次“双边协定”谈判的过程中，美国曾采取了露骨的高压手段，迫使西欧各国迅速签订与通过该项协定。据美新闻处二十八日电引国务院发言人谈话称，“在七月三日以后，任何受援国须待双边协定签字之后，才能获得欧洲复兴计划下之援助。”英官方人士亦于二十六日承认，“美国物资运输将自七月三日起中断，直至英国国会批准条约为止”（法新社）。因此，虽然西欧各国当局曾表示反对美国草约“语气太专横”；“若干条款只是单方面的，例如条约对受援国的约束期限是四年，而美国方面则每年决定”；“草约中有些地方甚至已超越了哈瓦那国际贸易机构宪章的规定，而这宪章还没有一国签字”（均据路透社六月十日电）；而英国更怕“现在的草约使美国有权在事先不与英国商量，便更改英镑兑换率”（伦敦六月十日广播）；但是他们还是在美帝国主义的意志下可耻地屈服了。
