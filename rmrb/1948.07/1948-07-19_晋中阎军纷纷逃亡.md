　　[Jinzhong News] On June 22nd, when a unit of Yan's bandits was defeated by our forces and retreated to Xiashan Village south of Qixian County, Wu Jicai, a soldier of the Second Company, First Battalion, Forty-sixth Division (a conscripted soldier), hid in an old woman's house. After dark, he carried a machine gun and sixty rounds of ammunition and voluntarily surrendered to our × unit. On the same day, squad leader Mu Guochang, along with soldiers Duan Chengye and You Linbin, took advantage of a search operation in Qicheng Village, southeast of the city, to surrender to our × unit, bringing with them three rifles, three hundred rounds of ammunition, and nine hand grenades. After arriving, they immediately denounced the crimes of Yan's bandits. According to them, "It's unbearable to suffer over there. We have to build fortifications day and night and also engage in 'self-confession and rebirth' (Yan's bandits' method of suppressing and ruling subordinates and the people, forcing everyone to make 'self-confessions,' and immediately killing anyone suspected). We eat half a catty of coarse noodles per meal, and we are so hungry that we have no choice but to eat wheat in the wheat fields." (Chun)
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 14th] On June 23rd, after the People's Liberation Army sent the body of Hou Fujun, commander of the Yan army's 70th Division, who was killed between Fenyang and Wenshui, back to Fenyang City, the Yan army trapped in the city had a deeper understanding of the PLA's lenient policy, and they fled in droves. The Yan army's replenishment training regiment stationed in the west and south gates of Fenyang City recently saw twenty or thirty people desert in one night. The Fifth Company of the Second Regiment of the Fenyang Security Corps originally had more than forty people, and fourteen people have deserted in the past four or five days. Large numbers of desertions have also occurred in the 208th Regiment and 209th Regiment of the 70th Division stationed in Fenyang. These regiments originally had four or five thousand people, but after repeated annihilation blows by the People's Liberation Army and the desertion of soldiers, there are now less than two thousand people, including cooks, grooms, and conscripts. The local soldiers who retreated to the vicinity of Fenyang City also fled to the Liberated Areas with their weapons.

　　晋中阎军纷纷逃亡
    【晋中讯】六月二十二日，阎匪一部被我击溃退到祁县城南下申村时，其四十六师二团一营二连士兵吴吉才（被抓的兵）躲在一个老太太家里，天黑后扛机枪一挺，带子弹六十发自动到我×部投诚。同日该部七连五班长慕国昌带领士兵段成业、尤林宾两人在城东南祁城村趁搜索之际，向我×部投诚，并携来步枪三支、子弹三百发、手榴弹九颗。他们来后即向我军控诉阎匪的罪恶。据他们说：“在那边受罪的没法，黑夜白天修工事，还得搞‘自白转生’（阎匪镇压统治部下与人民的办法，迫令每个人进行‘自白’，稍有可疑，即行屠杀。）每顿吃半斤粗面，饿得没办法，都到麦地里弄麦子吃”。（纯）
    【新华社晋绥十四日电】六月二十三日解放军将在汾阳、文水间击毙的阎军七十师师长侯福俊尸体送回汾阳城后，使困守该城阎军对解放军的宽大政策有了更深刻的认识，纷纷逃亡。驻汾阳城西、南两关的阎军补训团，最近一夜就逃跑了二、三十人。汾阳保安二团五中队原有四十多人，近四、五天中就逃亡十四人。驻汾阳的七十师二零八团、二零九团等部更发生大批逃亡。该团等部原有四、五千人，经解放军屡次歼灭性打击及士兵逃亡，现连伙马夫、义务兵还不到两千人。退入汾阳城附近的乡兵也纷纷携械逃入解放区。
