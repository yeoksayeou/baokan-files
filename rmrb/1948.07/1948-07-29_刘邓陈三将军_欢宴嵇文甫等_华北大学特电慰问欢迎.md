Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 22nd: Renowned figures from educational and journalistic circles in Henan, including Ji Wenfu, Wang Yizhai, Guo Haichang, and Liu Guoming, recently arrived in a certain area of the Central Plains. Generals Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, and Chen Yi hosted a banquet in their honor. Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, on behalf of the CCP Central Plains Bureau and the Central Plains Military Region, expressed deep sympathy and welcome, and then summarized the current situation in the Central Plains. Political Commissar Deng stated: The entire Central Plains region has a population of 45 million, of which 21 million people live in completely liberated areas. In the remaining half of the region, the People's Army and the democratic government are also conducting victorious struggles. The complete liberation of the Central Plains is not far off. Although the Central Plains Liberation Army is still in its initial stages and in a period of military struggle, various construction projects are underway. Now that you have come to the liberated area to be with us, we will need everyone to be jointly responsible for the various construction projects in the Central Plains in the future. Most of you are from Henan and have been engaged in cultural and educational work for many years. You have many connections with the people of the Central Plains and are familiar with the local situation. In the future, you will surely make more contributions to the people of the Central Plains. Ji and others successively delivered speeches, expressing their agreement with the various propositions of the CCP, and hoping to participate in various construction projects in the Central Plains liberated area under the leadership of the CCP. Ji and others also introduced the vigorous development of the people's democratic movement in the Jiang area, especially the heroic struggles of students in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin), and other places, as well as the dark corruption and internal disintegration of Chiang Kai-shek's rule. In his speech, General Chen Yi highly praised the efforts of democratic figures in the Jiang-controlled areas and the patriotic democratic movement of students across the country, and expressed his respect for the democratic figures who came to the liberated area.

Xinhua News Agency, North China, 26th: Wu Yuzhang, President of North China University, Vice Presidents Fan Wenlan and Cheng Fangwu, Dean of Studies Qian Junrui, and all faculty and students, recently sent a telegram to the Central Plains to express their condolences and welcome to Ji Wenfu and other cultural celebrities and young students who recently came from Kaifeng to the liberated area. The telegram praised their actions for pointing out the correct path for all conscientious intellectuals in the Jiang-controlled areas, and welcomed them to join forces on the educational front in the liberated area.
