　　Reporter of the North China General Branch
  　Summarizes this Year's Wheat Collection Work
  　Some Areas Still Show Disguised Forced Order Phenomena
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] A reporter from the North China General Branch summarized problems existing in certain areas regarding this year's wheat collection, stating: "This year's wheat collection quota is very light," and "This year's wheat collection is relatively reasonable." From reports from various locations, this seems to be the general reflection of the masses. Party and government leading organs in various places have held meetings to explain the rationale behind abolishing the unified progressive tax and the spirit of the new tax regulations, and reviewed and corrected various problems in wheat collection. In many places, wheat collection has become a conscious movement among the masses, implementing self-reporting and public discussion. The past style of simply completing tasks through forced orders has been greatly reduced, which is good. However, there are still some problems worth considering amidst the progress: (1) Party members and cadres taking the lead by over-reporting: "In Bei Wuhe Village, Lingshou, at the summer grain collection conference, eight Party members voluntarily paid an extra two dou and eight sheng. This influenced eleven liberated peasant households to actively self-report, and they paid an extra three dou, seven sheng, and four he. Shi Lianfu harvested three dou of wheat, should have paid five sheng and four ge, but he paid an extra four sheng and six ge, totaling one dou." This method of Party members and cadres taking the lead by over-reporting seems good at first glance, but the result is that the masses, who were originally unwilling to over-report, were forced to follow suit. Shi Lianfu harvested three dou and paid one dou, which is obviously excessive and not voluntary. In Xiaobi Village, Third District, Huolu, after the summer grain collection issues were explained at the meeting, many cadres challenged the masses, saying: "We will pay everything before breakfast tomorrow and guarantee the cleanliness of the wheat." Wang Tongxuan immediately followed, saying: "You are early? I will be even earlier than you. The conditions are the same for all of us. We will all prepare winnowing fans and see who can clean it the most?" More than ten people, including Wang Mingxuan and Luo Rong, accepted the challenge. Finally, Wang Zhixuan said: "We will see the results tomorrow, no empty talk." As soon as Wang Zhixuan finished speaking, many people murmured unofficially, "Who doesn't want to pay?..." From the masses' "unofficial murmurs," it seems that this type of challenge can lead to two negative consequences. On the one hand, it can create a disguised forced order for the masses. In some areas, the masses under-reported the acreage and yield of wheat. Instead of patiently enlightening and educating the masses and launching fair discussions among them, cadres personally intervened. For example, cadres from the Yinzhuang work group in Chiping, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, personally measured the land of the masses because the self-reports were untrue, resulting in a "standoff" between the leaders and the masses and a stalemate. This is still an act of forced order that is divorced from the masses. On the other hand, it can make ordinary Party members feel that they "cannot set an example" or "cannot take the lead." We believe that it is necessary for Communist Party members to set an example and take the lead, but it must take care of the majority and consider economic conditions. Excessive measures will lead to detachment from the masses and loss of the role of setting an example. All of these phenomena will have a very negative impact on the relationship between the masses and the government and the Party. (2) Many places emphasize a fast pace in order to be the first to complete the task. For example, in Gengjiazhuang, Boye, Central Hebei, when allocating quotas, cadres, in order to simplify matters and strive for a model, a few cadres discussed it and allocated quotas based on the combination of good and bad land, resulting in unfair and unreasonable phenomena. One household, Lao Heng, had a total of twelve mu of wheat land, harvested 1,152 jin, and paid 200 jin, accounting for 17.4% of the total wheat harvest; while another household, Gao Jixiu, planted three mu of wheat, harvested 144 jin, and paid 55 jin, accounting for 38% of the total wheat harvest. As a result, some were overburdened, and some were lightly burdened. Rushing for speed resulted in unfairness and unreasonableness, and of course, disregarded the mass line of self-reporting and public discussion. (3) In some individual areas, cadres still have illegal private apportionment of grain and money during wheat collection. Some village cadres in the Fifth District of Guangling, under the pretext of disaster relief and preferential treatment for resistance, arbitrarily and illegally apportioned grain and money, taking the opportunity to embezzle from it. Yulin Village apportioned 20 large shi at once, and Liujiagou apportioned 12 small shi and ten bolts of white cloth. Gaojiawa (a small natural village) has a total of nine households, of which four have a better life (middle peasants). These four households should have been responsible for one shi and two dou, but this time they were assigned one shi and three dou. The Wang family should have been responsible for one dou of public grain, but this time they were assigned three dou (millet). The village chief said, "Whether you have it or not, you have to give it." In addition, in Lühan, Raoyang, Central Hebei, a poor peasant league representative harvested four shi of wheat, but he falsely reported it as one shi and five dou, and the masses did not dare to mention it. These phenomena are very serious and must be resolutely corrected. Embezzlement and illegal apportionment should be distinguished by severity and given legal sanctions accordingly.

　　华北总分社记者
  　综述今年麦征工作
  　某些地区仍有变象强迫命令现象
    【本报特讯】华北总分社记者综述今年麦征中某些地区存在的问题称：“今年麦征数很轻”，“今年麦征比较合理”，从各地的报导中看来，这是群众普遍的反映。各地党政领导机关都开会解释了废除统一累进税的道理和新税则精神，检讨纠正了麦征中的各种毛病，麦征在很多地方形成群众自觉的运动，实行了自报公议，过去单纯为交任务而强迫命令的作风已经大大减少，这是好的。但在进步中还有些问题值得提出研究：（一）党员干部打先锋多报：“灵寿北五河村，在夏征大会上，有八个党员自愿多缴二斗八升，这样就影响了十一户翻身农民积极自报，又多缴出三斗七升四合，时连福打了三斗麦，应该缴五升四，他又多缴了四升六，共缴一斗。”这种党员干部打先锋多报的办法，猛一看去很好，但其结果，群众本不愿多报也只好被迫着跟多报起来，时连福打了三斗就缴了一斗，这显然是过重，不会出于自愿。获鹿三区小毕村，当开会说明了夏征问题后，不少干部向群众挑战说：“我们明天早饭以前，就要缴齐，并保证麦子干净。”王通选立刻接着说：“你们早？我比你们还要早，条件和你们一样，咱们都准备好扇车，看谁扇得净？”王明选、洛荣等十余人都应了战。最后王只选说：“明天见实的，不是说漂亮话。”王只选的话刚说完，便有不少的群众咕咕哝哝的非正式的说：“人家谁不愿意缴？……”。这里从群众“非正式的咕哝”看来，这种挑战方式会发生两种恶果，一方面对群众，可以造成变象的强迫命令。在有些地区，群众少报了种麦亩数和产量，这时不是耐心启发教育群众，使在群众中展开公平评议，却是干部亲自下手，如冀鲁豫茌平尹庄工作组干部，因为群众自报不实，就亲自下去丈量群众的土地，结果造成了领导和群众的“顶牛”，弄成僵局，这依然是强迫命令脱离群众的行动。另一方面，会使一般党员感到“模范不起”，“带头不起”。我们认为共产党员起模范带头作用是必须的，但须照顾多数，照顾经济条件，过火就会脱离群众失去模范带头作用。以上这些现象，都会造成群众对政府和党的关系以极不好的影响。（二）很多地方为抢先缴任务，强调快的作风。如冀中博野耿家庄，干部在分配数字时，为了简单省事，争取模范，少数干部商量了一下，就按好坏地搭配了一下分配下去，结果造成了不公平不合理的现象。一户叫老衡的，共十二亩麦地，打了一千一百五十二斤，缴了二百斤，负担占总麦收量的百分之十七点四；而另一户叫高济修的，种麦三亩，打了一百四十四斤，就缴了五十五斤，负担占总收麦量百分之三十八。这样一来，有的过重，有的过轻，抢快的结果是不公平不合理，当然也不顾走自报公议的群众路线了。（三）麦征中有个别地区的干部仍有非法私摊粮款的现象。广灵五区有的村干部假借救灾优抗之名，任意非法摊派粮款，趁机从中贪污。榆林村一次即摊廿大石，刘家沟摊十二小石、白布十匹。高家洼（一个小自然村）共九家，其中有四户生活较好（中农），该四家共应负担一石二斗，可是这次派了一石三斗，王家居应负担公粮一斗，这次就给他派了三斗（小米）。村长说：“有没有也得给。”此外，在冀中饶阳吕汉有一个贫农团代表打了四石麦子，他自己虚报成一石五斗，群众都不敢提。这些现象很严重，必须坚决纠正。贪污与非法摊派，应分轻重，分别给以法律制裁。
