(Taiyue News) The commerce of Yuncheng City is gradually shaking off the nature of a semi-colonial consumer market and turning to serve the national economy. In the past, the city's market mostly dealt in European and American woolens, gold and silver jewelry, lipsticks, and face powder, and had little commercial connection with the East Line (Liberated Area), mainly dealing with semi-colonial markets such as Xi'an, Luoyang, and Tianjin. This phenomenon continued for a period even after liberation. After several months of publicity, explanation, and concrete support from the democratic government, merchants such as Lin Rongwu, Wang Xingjiang, and Wang Chunheng were the first to go to Linqing, Handan, and other places to purchase necessities for the masses, and they made great profits upon their return, influencing more than 400 other merchants to go to Linfen, Jiyuan, Meng County, Luoyang, Handan, and other places to purchase goods. In addition, several businesses spontaneously organized a capital of 5 million yuan (Ji banknotes, same below) to purchase goods in the more distant Shijiazhuang. The trade company twice sold or lent nearly 20,000 jin of cotton to merchants at low prices, which were exchanged for machines, livestock, and other goods in Luoyang and other places. In addition, some merchants exchanged the remaining Chiang currency for tobacco leaves and necessities in Xi'an. The two major businesses, Fuxingchang and Xingxingyuan, which used to deal in foreign goods, have already begun to deal in products from the Liberated Areas. Many businesses are converting to new trades. There are now six private salt depots, and it is estimated that they will soon increase to twenty. There are two huazhan (flower warehouse) and two zhongzidian (seed store).

　　运城不少商号
    纷纷转业
    【太岳讯】运城市商业逐渐摆脱半殖民地消费市场的性质，转向为国民经济服务。该市市场过去多经营欧美呢绒，金银珠宝，口红香粉等消耗品，商业关系和东线（解放区）联系很少，主要和西安、洛阳、天津等半殖民地市场来往。这种现象直到解放后还继续一个时期。经民主政府几个月来的宣传解释与具体扶植，首先有商人林荣五、王兴江王春恒等，到临清、邯郸等地置办群众必需品，回来后获利很大，影响其他商人分头到临汾、济源、孟县、洛阳、邯郸等地办货者，约有四百多人。另有几家商号自动组织了五百万元（冀钞，下同）资金，到更远的石家庄办货。贸易公司曾两次低价卖给、赊给商人近二万斤棉花，到洛阳等地换回机器、牲口及其他货物，另外有些商人将残存的蒋币到西安换回烟叶与必需品。过去经营洋广货的福兴昌、兴星沅二家大商号，已经开始兼营解放区的出产品了。不少商号纷纷转业，现私人盐栈已有六家，估计不久就会增到二十为花栈、家，转种店的各有两家。
