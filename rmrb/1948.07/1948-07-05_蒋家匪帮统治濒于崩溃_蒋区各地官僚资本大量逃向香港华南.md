Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Comprehensive report:

    Large amounts of floating capital and industrial capital from various areas in the Chiang-controlled region are increasingly fleeing to Hong Kong, Southern China, and other places. Those fleeing south are mainly bureaucratic capitalists. As the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's rule teeters on the brink of collapse, they are transferring the wealth they obtained by sucking the blood of the people, which is still in China, to Hong Kong and Southern China, which American imperialism is intensifying its control over, and gradually transferring it overseas. On the other hand, a small portion is national industrial capital that cannot withstand the oppression of the Chiang government and seeks a place to settle. The transfer activity is centered on Shanghai and Guangzhou, and the exodus extends to Changchun and Shenyang in the Northeast, Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao in North China, Nanjing and Hankou in Central China, and Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Kunming in the Northwest and Southwest, as well as other large and small cities. This southward flight of floating capital and industrial capital began on a large scale in the second half of last year and has recently reached an extremely intense level.

    The trend of floating capital fleeing south is clearly reflected in the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Over the past year, the aforementioned exchange rate has increased nearly thirty-fold, about twice the rate of the Shanghai wholesale price index, which rose fifteen-fold during the same period. In the first four months of this year, the Hong Kong exchange rate has surged nearly five-fold, from 100,000 Chiang currency for HK$3.10 on January 5th to only HK$0.61 on May 4th (Beiping Pingming Daily, May 5th). Obviously, this is the result of a massive flow of funds from the Chiang-controlled region, especially Shanghai, to Hong Kong. According to an Associated Press report, in the second week of June alone, floating capital flowing into Shanghai from Beiping reached a staggering one trillion yuan per day. The Tianjin Dagong Daily also revealed on April 30th that the floating capital fleeing from various places to Guangzhou reached 500 to 600 billion yuan on April 16th and 17th alone. According to general estimates, no less than several trillion yuan flowed into Guangzhou in the first half of April. Gold and US dollars are important means of escaping for these floating capitals. Due to the inconvenience of exchange, privileged classes directly use airplanes, trains, and ships to transport large quantities of gold, foreign currencies, and cash. According to the Shanghai Economic Weekly, "the owners of the northern floating capital that are fleeing are not ordinary people, but mainly civil and military bureaucratic capital." In November of last year, after the People's Liberation Army captured Shijiazhuang, a military stronghold in North China, northern floating capital "surged south" (Shanghai Economic Weekly). According to an Associated Press report, from the 10th to the 16th of that month, funds fleeing from the Northeast and North China to Shanghai exceeded five trillion yuan, while in the middle of that month, floating capital fleeing from Central China to Hong Kong reached 2 billion Hong Kong dollars (equivalent to approximately 29 trillion Chiang currency at the official exchange rate at that time, and more on the black market). The largest bureaucratic capitalists are transferring their assets to the Americas. The Hong Kong Free Tribune quoted Mr. Z.Y. Zau in the Canadian Forum Daily on October 1st of last year as saying: "Whether it is Chiang Kai-shek or his ministers, they have lost confidence in their own strength and are transferring large amounts of US dollars to the Americas."

    The southward flight of industrial equipment and capital includes dozens of light and heavy industries, such as steelmaking, machinery, hardware products, cotton textiles, woolen textiles, silk textiles, silk, shirts and socks, printing and dyeing, printing, cigarettes, carpets, woodwork, oil production, and kilns. According to incomplete statistics, since March of this year, the number of factories that have already moved or are preparing to move to Hong Kong and other places has reached 120 to 130. In April alone, the number of new factories registered with the Hong Kong Labour Department that have been approved or are under application has reached as many as 75 (Tianjin Xin Xing Daily, May 24th). According to Pingming Daily in early May, citing materials from Hong Kong economic publications, the industrial capital that has recently moved from the Chiang-controlled region to Hong Kong has reached approximately HK$50 million (approximately US$10 million). The textile industry, which has the most impact on people's livelihoods, accounts for the majority of industries fleeing to Hong Kong. According to the Tianjin Dagong Daily at the end of April, in Shanghai alone, more than ten yarn factories have already been opened or are preparing to be opened in Hong Kong, with a total of approximately 200,000 spindles. Among them, the capital of six yarn factories, including Nanguo, Peninsula, and Nanhai, amounts to HK$108 million. Among the total number of spindles in these more than ten yarn factories, based on existing materials, more than half are owned by the Song Ziwen Zhongfang Company and its affiliated Shenxin Yarn Factory. Among them, the Hong Kong, Kowloon, Weilen, and Nanyang factories have either partially started operations or are about to start operations. Pingming Daily revealed in early May that "most of these factories moving to Hong Kong have capital backgrounds of wealthy families." The Tianjin Dagong Daily also stated on June 2nd that "most of the southward transferred funds (referring to industrial funds) are special elements." The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government is colluding with American imperialism, preparing to move important industries in the Northeast and North China to South China, distributed in the so-called "Xijiang Industrial Zone" (Guangdong), "Zhuzhou Industrial Zone" (Central Hunan), "Ma'anshan Industrial Zone" (western suburbs of Nanjing), and Taiwan. According to the Qingdao Junmin Daily at the end of March, in Qingdao alone, there are 40 to 50 factories to be moved to Taiwan. The Tangshan Steel Plant received a secret order from the authorities last month to dismantle the machines, pack them into boxes, and transport them to Daye, southeast of Wuhan. According to reports from foreign news agencies such as Associated Press and Reuters, Ong Wenhao, the newly appointed Executive Yuan President of the Chiang regime, publicly announced at a Legislative Yuan meeting on June 7th that "the government plans to move important factories in North China to South China and Central China, south of the Yangtze River."

    In addition, some of the national industrial and commercial capital were forced to flee to Hong Kong. The Tianjin Renli Woolen Textile Company was forced to relocate its machines purchased from abroad to Hong Kong to set up a factory due to the Chiang bandit's control over imports and exports. An import and export merchant who moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong said: "We came with tears in our eyes."

　　蒋家匪帮统治濒于崩溃
    蒋区各地官僚资本大量逃向香港华南
    【新华社陕北三日电】综合报导：
    蒋区各地大量游资及工业资本正日益猛烈地逃向香港、华南等地。南逃者主要为官僚资本，蒋介石匪帮在其统治濒于崩溃之际，正在将其吮吸人民膏血得来的、还留在中国的财富，转移到香港与美帝国主义正在加紧进行控制的华南，并逐步转移到海外去。另一方面，也有一小部分是不堪蒋政府压迫而企图寻求栖身之所的民族工业资本。转移活动以上海、广州两地为中心，逃风遍及东北的长春、沈阳，华北的北平、天津、青岛，华中的南京、汉口，西北的西安、兰州，西南的成都、重庆、昆明等各大小城市。这种游资和工业资本的南逃，系自去年下半年大规模开始，最近已达于极猛烈程度。
    游资南逃的趋势，显明地表现在香港对上海的汇兑关系上，去年一年中，上述汇率上涨约近卅倍，比同期内，上海批发物价指数上涨十五倍的速度约大一倍；今年头四个月中，港汇已从一月五日的蒋币十万元换港币三元一角涨到五月四日的仅换六角一分，即猛涨几达五倍（北平平明日报五月五日电）。显然这是由于蒋区特别是上海巨大资金流向香港的结果。据合众社消息，六月份第二周内，仅由北平一地涌入上海的游资每日达一万亿元之巨。天津大公报亦于四月卅日披露：仅四月十六、十七两日各地逃往广州游资即达五、六千亿元。据一般估计，四月上半月流入广州的资金不下数万亿元。黄金、美钞是这些游资逃避的重要手段。大批黄金、外币与现钞因不便汇兑，特权阶级便直接利用飞机、火车和轮船逃运。据沪经济周报披露：南逃的“北方游资的所有者不是普通人士，主要是文武官僚资本。”去年十一月间，人民解放军攻克华北军事重镇石家庄后，北方游资即“汹涌南下”（沪经济周报）。据美联社报导：该月十日至十六日，东北、华北逃往上海资金已超过五万亿元，而该月中旬，华中逃港游资则已达廿亿港币（即依当时官价汇率约合蒋币廿九万余亿元，黑市当不止此）。最大的官僚资本，则纷纷转至美洲。香港自由丛刊于去年十月一日引加拿大论坛日报载文幼章氏谈称：“无论是蒋介石也好，蒋的部长们也好，都已对自己的力量失去信心，正在把大批美金移藏到美洲。”
    工业设备及资金的南逃，则包括炼钢、机器、五金制品、棉纺织、毛织、丝织、丝绸、衫袜、印染、印刷、卷烟、地毯、木器、制油、窑等轻重工业数十业。据不完全统计，今年三月以来，已经或正在准备迁往香港等地的工厂已达一百二、三十家，仅四月份一月内向香港劳工处注册的新工厂经获准及正申请中者即达七十五家之多（天津新星报五月二十四日）。又据平明日报五月初引香港经济刊物材料，最近由蒋区移往香港，已经到达的工业资金约达五千万港币（约折合美金一千万元）。逃港工业以与民生最有影响的纺织业占多数。据天津大公报四月底披露，仅上海一地已经或正在准备在港开设的纱厂已在十家以上，共有纱锭约达二十万枚左右。其中南国、半岛、南海等六家纱厂资本额即达一亿另八百万港币。此十家以上纱厂的纱锭总数中，仅据现有材料可说明其背景者，即有一半以上为宋子文中纺公司及与其有关的申新纱厂所有，其中香港、九龙、纬伦、南洋等厂则或已部分开工，或即将开工。平明日报五月初曾透露，迁港的“这些工厂大部以豪门资本为背景”。天津大公报六月二日亦称：“南调资金（指工业资金）以特殊分子居多”。蒋介石卖国政府正与美帝国主义勾结，准备把东北、华北的重要工业迁往华南，分布在所谓“西江工业区”（广东）、“株州工业区”（湘中）、“马鞍山工业区”（南京西郊）及台湾等地。据三月底青岛军民日报载：仅青岛一地，即有四、五十个工厂要迁往台湾。唐山炼钢厂已于上月接到当局密令拆卸机器装箱运往武汉东南之大冶。另据美联、路透等外国通讯社报导：蒋记新任行政院长翁文＠且于六月七日立法院会议上公开宣布“政府计划将华北的重要工厂迁移至长江以南的华南及华中”。
    此外，被迫逃港的有一部分是民族工商业资本。天津仁立毛织公司即因蒋匪统制进出口，而被迫把购自国外的机器改运香港设厂。一位从上海迁港的进出口商人说：“我们是带着泪来的”。
