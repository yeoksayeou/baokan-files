　　Unauthorized Stipulation that Poor Peasant League Members be Exempt from Burdens
  　Gaocheng Nanlonggong Work Group Violates the Party's Burden Policy
    [Our Newspaper Dispatch] The Gaocheng Nanlonggong Village Work Group, in violation of government decrees and the Party's policy of fair and reasonable burdens, arbitrarily stipulated during the summer grain collection that all poor peasant league members should be exempt from burdens. This leftist erroneous behavior aroused opposition from all strata of the village. In addition to middle peasants and new rich peasants expressing opposition, even poor peasants who had not joined the Poor Peasant League were dissatisfied. Wang Xiaogui and Wang Xiaoshou are brothers who just separated their household. Wang Xiaogui has a family of five, cultivating 2.4 mu of land. Because he did not join the Poor Peasant League, he had to contribute seven bolts of cloth. Xiaoshou also has a family of five, and his land is half as much as Xiaogui’s, but because he joined the Poor Peasant League, he didn’t have to contribute a single bolt of cloth. The old branch secretary Ma Shuanzhu's situation was not as good as the Poor Peasant League member Ma Kuizi, but he was still asked to contribute cloth. The masses of the whole village eagerly hope that responsible Party and government comrades can clearly observe this unfair phenomenon, quickly withdraw the work group, and re-establish a fair and reasonable burden allocation method.

　　擅自规定贫农团员免负担
  　藁城南龙宫工作组违反党的负担政策
    【本报讯】藁城南龙宫村工作组，违反政府法令、违反党的公平合理的负担政策，在夏征中擅自规定贫农团员一律免出负担，这种左倾错误行为引起全村各阶层的反对。除中农及新富农表示反对外，一般未参加贫农团的贫农也很不满。王小贵和王小瘦是刚分家的弟兄，王小贵五口人，种二亩四分地，因未参加贫农团，出了七个布。小瘦也是五口人，土地比小贵多一半，因为参加了贫农团，却一个布也没有出，旧支部书记马拴柱的时光不如贫农团员马奎子，也叫他出了布。全村群众渴望党政负责同志能明察此种不平现象，迅速将该工作组撤走，并重新规定分平合理的负担办法。（药夫、愧玉）
