Wanping Fourth District Overcomes Disaster
[Chahar News] Wanping Fourth District consists of twenty-four villages, all of which are very poor. The amount of land is small, and the quality is also poor. The average per capita landholding in the entire district is less than two mu. The relatively wealthy Qiulinzhen Village has an average of only 2.5 mu per person. Zhongshan Village has only about 0.7 mu per person. In normal years, the grain harvested in the district, plus mountain products such as walnuts, peppercorns, and almonds, is not enough to sustain a year's life. The shortfall is mainly made up by income from cutting firewood and burning charcoal in winter, and working in kilns in Mentougou. The lives of the masses are very difficult. The harvest was bad last year. In Qingtujian Village, with 124 households, more than 20 households had nothing to eat after the autumn harvest, and this year's spring famine was very serious.

The masses in the district adopted the following methods to finally overcome the spring famine, plant all the spring seedlings, and complete the first hoeing. (1) Actively develop production such as transporting and selling medicinal materials and digging them. After the autumn harvest last year, the masses in the district foresaw that this spring's disaster would be serious, so they actively carried out winter production, transporting and selling persimmons in large quantities. In Qingtujian Village, even the old men in their sixties, children of fifteen or sixteen, and women participated in transportation and sales, carrying persimmons back from Liangxiang Hetaogou, sixty or seventy li away, and then going to Zhuolu to exchange them for grain. Until the beginning of this year, in addition to eating, the village earned a total of 300 shi of corn from selling persimmons, which could solve the village's grain problem for at least two months. In order to solve the difficulties of the masses in the district, the store used grain to collect medicinal materials in large quantities this spring. The masses all lived on Baihua Mountain digging medicinal materials. Jinjitai Village earned 3,000 jin of millet from digging medicinal materials. Yu Laobai alone dug more than 100 jin in seven or eight days, earning more than 80 jin of millet. Other villages also earned a lot from digging medicinal materials, selling peppercorns, and selling toon. (2) The government focuses on issuing agricultural loans to support production. Two loans of 84,000 jin of grain, one loan of 62 million yuan (border currency, same below), and 11,000 jin of militia battle grain originally in the district, were also selectively loaned out, appropriately solving the difficulties of disaster-stricken villages and households in spring plowing, sowing, and the first hoeing. Now the sowing and first hoeing in the entire district have been completed ahead of schedule, and the second hoeing is being organized. (3) Organize military dependents, workers, and families of martyrs for production, reducing the labor burden on the masses, so that the masses have time to engage in more production and increase income. From spring plowing to the first hoeing, Jinjitai Village used 1,000 fewer preferential workdays than in the same period last year, allowing the masses to free up more time to dig medicinal materials and engage in transportation and sales. (4) A mountain vegetable campaign was launched, saving a lot of grain. Taian Mountain Village has already collected 20,000 jin of dried elm leaves, which can save more than 10,000 jin of grain.

The district's organization and leadership of the masses to overcome the famine grasped several key points: (1) Strengthen publicity and education to the masses and cadres, so that everyone recognizes the severity of the disaster and the need for production and self-salvation. And pay attention to overcoming the idea of ​​some people simply relying on agricultural loans for "relief." Liu Juchen, a poor peasant in Xiyuan Village, had an attitude of not engaging in production, thinking that he would be given more food when he ran out, so he ate and drank extravagantly the four shi of corn and one shi of grain he had been allocated during the land reform. Later, after the cadres explained and educated him, he realized his mistake of waste, and from then on he actively engaged in transportation and sales, and ate vegetables to overcome the famine. (2) Branch party members played a leading role in production and overcoming the famine. In response to the district party committee's call for "party members to lead the masses to overcome the famine," the Jinjitai Village branch immediately convened a branch mobilization meeting to discuss methods and decided that party members should participate in various production organizations. Zhang Guangyi led the entire village in picking mountain vegetables, and also led Yu Congqi and Tan Wentian to Baihua Mountain to dig medicinal materials. The most recent time they went for three days, each person brought back more than 50 jin, which could be exchanged for 40 jin of millet.

The following shortcomings still exist in the district's production and famine relief work, some of which have been corrected and some of which are being resolved: (1) Not all grain and loans were used for production, and some villages still have the phenomenon of average use. For example, the first grain loan in Jinlintai was available to every poor peasant household, and it was not rationally distributed based on needs. Zhang Chengxian used the loan to pay off his smoking debt, but some middle peasants who had nothing to eat did not receive a loan. (2) Cadre transfers are frequent, and some individuals do not work with peace of mind, and do not pay enough attention to leading production and overcoming the famine. They think that once the spring seedlings are planted, the production work is almost done, and there is no need to lead it anymore. Later, this idea was reversed. (3) The work has not been thoroughly checked among the masses. Many villages have experienced diseases and disasters, and the leaders have not quickly organized doctors to treat them, and many witches have taken the opportunity to become active, affecting production and overcoming the famine.

### 支部党员领导群众生产自救　宛平四区渡过灾荒

　　支部党员领导群众生产自救
  　宛平四区渡过灾荒
    【察哈尔讯】宛平四区共有二十四个村庄，全很穷。土地数量少，质量也坏。全区每人平均不到二亩。较富的秋林镇村，每人平均才二亩五分。中山村每人平均才有七分左右。该区平常年景，打的粮食加上核桃、花椒、杏仁等山货，也不足维持一年的生活。缺额主要依靠冬季砍柴烧炭，和到门头沟走窑等收入弥补，群众生活非常苦寒。去年收成不好，一百二十四户的青土涧村，收秋后就有二十多户没有吃的，今年春荒非常严重。
    该区群众采用以下办法，终于胜利的渡过春荒，种上全部春苗，并已锄完头遍。（一）积极开展运销刨药材等生产。去年秋收以后，该区群众预见到今春灾荒一定严重，因而积极的进行了冬季生产，大量的贩柿子，搞运销。青土涧村连六十多岁的老头，十五六的儿童及妇女都参加运销，到六、七十里地远的良乡河套沟去背回柿子，再到涿鹿去换粮食，直至今年开春，除去吃用外，全村贩柿子总共挣了棒子三百石，最少能解决全村两个月的吃粮。商店为了解救该区群众的困难，今春用粮食大量收药材。群众全到百花山上住着刨掘，金鸡台一村，刨药材收入达小米三千斤。该村于老百一个人七八天刨了一百来斤，得小米八十多斤。其他村庄刨药材、卖花椒、卖香椿的收入也都不少。（二）政府有重点的发放农贷扶助生产。两次贷粮八万四千斤，一次贷款六千二百万元（边币，下同），区里原有的民兵战粮等一万一千斤，也有重点的贷出，适当的解决了灾村灾户春耕播种和锄头遍当中的困难，现全区播种和锄头遍已提前完成，正组织锄二遍中。（三）组织军、工、烈属生产，减轻群众劳力负担，使群众有时间从事更多的生产，增加收入。金鸡台村从春耕到锄头遍，比去年同时期少用了一千个优待工，使群众能誊出更多的时间去刨药材、作运销。（四）开展了打山菜运动，节省下不少粮食。太安山村已打下干榆叶两万斤，能节省粮食一万来斤。
    该区组织领导群众渡荒，掌握了几个关键：（一）加强对群众、干部的宣传教育，使大家认识到灾荒严重，必须生产自救。并注意了克服某些人单纯依靠农贷“救济”的思想。西苑村贫农刘巨臣，有一种不事生产的思想，认为没吃的还会再分给他，就把土改中分得的四石玉米一石谷，大吃二喝起来。后来干部对他解释教育，他认识到自己浪费的错误，从此就积极的搞运销，吃菜渡荒。（二）支部党员在生产渡荒中起了带头作用。金鸡台村支部响应区委“党员领导群众渡荒”的号召，立即召开支部动员大会，商讨办法，决定党员都参加到各种生产组织中去。张广义领导全村打山菜，还领着于从起、谭文田到百花山刨药材，最近一次去了三天，每人刨回来五十多斤，能换小米四十斤。
    该区生产渡荒工作中，还存有以下缺点，有的已经纠正，有的正在解决：（一）贷粮贷款未全部用到生产中去，某些村还有平均使用的现象。如金林台的第一次贷粮是每户贫农都有，并未从需要出发合理分配。张成贤把贷款还了抽烟帐，但某些中农没有吃的，却未贷到粮食。（二）干部调动频繁，个别人工作不安心，对生产渡荒的领导不够重视。认为种出春苗来，生产工作就差不多了，用不着再领导了，后来才把这种思想扭转过来。（三）没有很好的深入群众中检查工作。不少村庄发生病灾，领导上没有很快组织医生救治，许多巫婆趁机活动起来，影响了生产渡荒。
