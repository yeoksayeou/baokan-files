The Women's International Democratic Federation

　　The Women's International Democratic Federation was established in 1946 and has more than 83 million members (according to statistics from May this year). It is one of the most important global democratic organizations. During the March 8th International Women's Day this year, women's organizations from 48 countries participated in the Women's International Democratic Federation. At the Executive Committee meeting held in Rome in May this year, it accepted the German Democratic Women's League, the Bengal Women's Congress, the Malayan Women's Association, the Burmese Women's Association, and the Norwegian Women's Federation as members. The Women's International Democratic Federation includes women's organizations from the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and the liberated areas of China, as well as the French Women's Union, which has one million members, the American Women's Congress, which has hundreds of thousands of members, and the British Women's Organization, which has 100,000 members. In the past two years, the Women's International Democratic Federation has launched many global mass movements, such as opposing the sabotage of the Potsdam Agreement; demanding the unconditional implementation of the United Nations disarmament decision; banning the use of atomic bombs and war propaganda; and assisting the Greek people, the Indonesian people, and Spanish patriots. The president of the Women's International Democratic Federation is Madame Vaillant-Couturier of France, and the vice presidents are Dolores Ibárruri (leader of the Spanish Communist Party), Nina Popova of the Soviet Union (Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee), Gene Weltfish of the United States (Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University in New York), and Cai Chang, a Chinese women's leader.
