[Chahar News] In Wanquan, Huailai, Fangshan, Liangxiang and other places in the third special district of Beiyue, many dependents of military personnel, workers, and revolutionary martyrs have organized themselves to participate in production, reducing the burden of labor on the masses. Han Jingzhen's work exchange group in Yanjia Terrace, Wanquan First District, consists of sixteen people, only three of whom are not dependents of military personnel or workers. They organized in February, carrying coal and manure themselves. During the spring plowing and sowing season, they plowed fifteen acres of land. They have a total of ninety-six acres of land, ninety percent of which they cultivate themselves. In previous years, each household used no less than twenty preferential labor days; this year, only a few households used a few woodcutters. After the military, worker, and martyr dependents in Jinjitai Village, Fourth District, participated in production, they saved a total of one thousand substitute labor days. The six military dependents' households in Zhangjia Village, who were most lacking in labor, organized a work exchange group led by Liang Shirun. Starting from the twenty-sixth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, they collected manure, sending all six hundred baskets of manure to the fields. From spring plowing to weeding, they only used five male laborers to help and planted all the land and completed weeding. Liang Shirun herself also planted one hundred and twenty catties of yam and two catties of cloud beans (seeds). She said, "As long as we work hard and produce more, we won't go hungry ourselves, and it will save the village from taking care of us." After reviewing the shortcomings of some people being irresponsible when providing preferential labor and some military, worker, and martyr dependents being able to produce but not doing so, simply relying on preferential treatment, Luyepo Village in the Second District of Huailai determined that in the future, preferential labor days would be recorded according to work done, and it must be guaranteed that the work is done well. At the same time, they educated and persuaded military, worker, and martyr dependents to actively participate in production. They organized work exchange groups based on the spirit of voluntarism; the village was responsible for helping the seven households that were truly lacking in labor. The entire village of forty-four military, worker, and martyr households used an average of more than four hundred preferential labor days each year in the past. This year, after rectification and organization, they only used eighteen livestock labor days and more than twenty human labor days to plant the land well. The originally decided substitute farming households also tried their best to participate in production. Su Congzhen, who is already sixty-four years old this year, also voluntarily asked to join the work exchange group; Zhang Guimei and Du Wenyuan both brought their children and organized together to carry out production, weeding the land and collecting firewood. One military dependent household, which used to use fifty or sixty preferential labor days every year, only used a few labor days this year under everyone's influence. Qianshimen Village in the Second District of Fangshan has a total of ten military, worker, and martyr households, including four households with seventeen people, without any full labor force. The village originally planned to help them with seventy labor days throughout the year, but with their active participation in labor, from the beginning of spring to the first weeding, they only used twelve labor days.

　　平西军工烈属积极参加生产
    【察哈尔讯】北岳三专区宛平、怀来、房山、良乡等地，不少军、工、烈属组织起来参加生产，减轻群众劳力负担。宛平一区燕家台妇女韩景珍的拨工组，共十六个人，只有三个人不是军、工属。她们从二月组织起来，自己背煤、背粪，在春耕播种时期曾拉犁耕地十五亩。她们共有土地九十六亩，百分之九十都是自己耕种的。往年她们每户所用的优待工都不下二十个，今年只个别户用了几个打柴工。四区金鸡台村的军、工、烈属参加生产以后，共节省了一千个代耕工。张家村六户最缺劳力的军属在梁士润带领下，组织了一个拨工组，由正月二十六开始搞粪，把六家的六百多篓粪全送到地里，从春耕到锄苗，她们只用了五个男工帮助，就把所有的土地全种上了，锄完了苗。梁士润本人还单独种了一百二十斤山药二斤云豆（种），她说：“只要好好劳动，多生产，自己挨不了饿，也省的让村中照顾。”怀来二区鹿业坡村检讨了以前有些人出优待工时不负责任，及某些军、工、烈属能生产而不生产，单纯依靠优待等缺点后，即确定了今后出优待工时按活记工，一定保证把活作好，同时教育说服军、工、烈属积极生产。她们根据自愿精神组织了拨工组；七户实在缺乏劳动力的，由村中负责帮助。全村四十四户军、工、烈属，过去每年平均用优待工四百多个，今年经过整顿组织，只用十八个牲口工和二十多个人工就把地种好了。原来决定的代耕户也都尽力参加生产，苏从真今年已经六十四岁了，也自动要求参加拨工组；张桂梅、杜文苑二人都带着小孩，也组织到一起进行生产，锄了地还拾了柴。过去每年都得用优待工五、六十个的一户军属，在大家的影响下，今年只用了几个工。房山二区前石门村共有十户军、工、烈属，其中有四户十七口人，没有整劳动力，村中原计划全年帮他们七十个工，但在他们积极参加劳动之下，从开春到锄头遍，只用了十二个工。
