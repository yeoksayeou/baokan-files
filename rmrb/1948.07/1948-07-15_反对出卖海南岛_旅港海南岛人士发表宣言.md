　　Against Selling Hainan Island
    Hainan Islanders in Hong Kong Issue Declaration
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's crime of selling Hainan Island's sovereignty to the United States has aroused strong protests from the people of Hainan Island. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Hong Kong: Two hundred Hainan Islanders in Hong Kong issued a declaration on the 9th, protesting "American attempts to gain control of Hainan Island." The declaration revealed: The United States recently suggested to the Chinese government that they jointly manage and develop Hainan Island, turning it into a major air and naval base. The declaration stated: Apart from North China (Agence France-Presse note: possibly referring to the Communist-controlled areas), Central China under the government's control, especially Qingdao and Taiwan, have already been taken over by the United States. The declaration firmly stated: "We will fight to the end against ceding any inch of Taiwan or Hainan Island to the United States."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on June 5th, a special dispatch from Nanjing revealed: American imperialism has "informally" proposed to the Chiang government to use Hainan Island as an American naval base. The dispatch stated: "Reliable information has been obtained here: Hainan Island will become the main focus of American military aid to China. A senior military official revealed that the American side has proposed to our government that we jointly use Hainan Island as a naval base for both sides," and stated: "It is said that the construction of Hainan Island has always been of concern to the United States." Because "strategically speaking, the island, along with the Philippines and Taiwan, forms a triangle, and if used properly, it can control the entire Nanyang." Since Weidmeier's visit to China last July, Yulin Port on Hainan Island has been sold by Chiang Kai-shek to American imperialism. The fishing and iron ore rights of Hainan Island have also been successively controlled by the United States. In March and April of this year, Japanese war criminals who invaded China, such as Horiuchi Kansei, Japanese financial magnate Yamada Tadashi, and Japanese nationals Takeuchi Kengo, Kinrai Yoichi, and Okada Genzo, were successively sent to Hainan Island to assist the United States in developing the island. In mid-April of this year, US Ambassador Stuart and the head of the US military advisory group, Badavi, went to Hainan Island to "inspect the military and political situation," further confirming the plan to use Hainan Island as an American naval base and Chiang army training base.

　　反对出卖海南岛
    旅港海南岛人士发表宣言
    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋介石匪帮向美国出卖海南岛主权的罪行，已引起海南岛人民的强烈抗议。据法新社香港讯：旅港海南岛人士二百人于九日发表宣言，抗议“美国企图取得海南岛控制权”。宣言揭露：美国最近曾向中国政府建议共同管理海南岛，并开发海南岛，使之成为一个空军和海军大基地。宣言说：除了华北（法新社按可能指共产党地区）之外，政府控制下的华中，特别是青岛和台湾，已为美国接管。宣言坚决表示：“我们将为反对割让台湾或海南岛任何一寸土地给美国而奋斗到底”。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据六月五日天津益世报载该报南京专电披露：美帝国主义已向蒋政府“非正式”提出以海南岛作为美国海军根据地。该电称：“此间顷获得确息：海南岛将成为美国军事援华中之主要着眼点。军方某高级人士透露，美方已向我国政府提出将共同使用海南岛为双方之海军根据地”，并称：“闻海南岛建设始终为美国所注意”。因为“在战略上看来，该岛与菲律宾台湾恰为一三角形，如运用适宜，实能控制整个南洋”。按自去年七月魏德迈来华后，海南岛的榆林港即被蒋介石出卖给美帝国主义，海南岛之渔业和铁矿权也相继由美国控制，今年三、四月间日本侵华战犯崛内干城，日财阀山田忠及日人竹内健吾、进来要一、冈田源仓等相继被派到海南岛协助美国开发该岛。今年四月中旬，美大使司徒雷登与美国军事顾问团团长巴大维赴海南岛“视察军事与政治情况”，更进一步确定了以海南岛作为美国海军根据地和蒋军训练基地的计划。
