Several Problems in Changzhi Production

Changzhi's production campaign is currently at a critical juncture, with weeding, crop rotation after the wheat harvest, and fertilizer application for plowing. In order for the leadership to promptly address the current difficulties in the movement and advance the production campaign, the production situation and problems in the Fourth and Fifth Districts, which started spring plowing earlier this year, are written out for research.

　　　　I. Current Production Difficulties

Most villages in Changzhi's Fourth and Fifth Districts completed planting by early May. Very little wasteland was left uncultivated. According to a check of four villages in the Fourth District—Shibazhang, Shanhou, Pingjiazhuang, and Fengbeidi—the total did not exceed ten mu. However, the following difficulties exist in current production: (1) Some wrongly labeled households lack food and drink, and individual orphaned and widowed households cannot afford to pay wages. According to a report on June 15 from nine villages in the Fifth District, including Nan Song and Bei Song, although preliminary compensation was given to wrongly labeled households and landowning rich peasants were resettled during planting, difficulties have reemerged. In Beicanghe village, 20 out of 78 households cannot afford food and drink, and in Nan Song village, there are 26 households. Bei Song and Nan Song have already lent out some grain and loans to solve the difficulties for some people. Some villages have not yet resolved the issue due to limited conditions. Living difficulties directly affect production. Gejihai's family in Nan Song planted more than two mu of millet but, fearing they could not afford wages, told the mutual aid group, "Whether you finish weeding or not, I'll only give five work points." Some households who were struggled against are preoccupied with finding food and drink, only superficially weeding their own land just enough to prevent it from becoming completely overgrown. (2) Spring plowing and planting were rough, and now weeding is delaying work. According to statistics from 26 main villages in the Fourth District (out of a total of 39 in the district), when planting corn in the spring, some masses had concerns, and labor and animal power were difficult, so the preparation was rough. There were more than 22,000 mu of hard land that was planted without plowing, of which more than 4,900 mu were planted with corn. Generally, the seedlings are not growing vigorously. Now, to remedy this, it is necessary to apply additional fertilizer and cultivate the land. Lao Han, a military family member in Nan Song, planted three mu of millet on hard land and spent fifteen work points from the mutual aid group just to weed the first time, twice as much as in the past. (3) The preparation of fertilizer for top dressing is generally insufficient. In Zhao Village, Fifth District, more than 1,200 mu of corn were planted, but only 10,400 loads of night soil and manure were prepared for fertilizer, enough for more than 600 mu of land, only half the area. A large portion of the 610 mu of corn land in Bei Song has no way to be top dressed.

　　　　II. Reasons for the Above Difficulties

In addition to natural causes, the main reason for the leadership's problem is the spontaneous nature of production mutual aid. The numbers of those organized in the 26 main villages in the Fourth District are not small, but the actual situation is not like that: Shanhou village reported that most people were organized, but in reality, not a single group in the entire village was active. In Fengbeidi village, with more than 80 households, only six households formed a small group. In the Fifth District, in the four villages with relatively good base points—Taiyizhang, Dongzhang, etc.—out of more than 70 mutual aid groups, only 36 were actually active together. Others only had a group leader but no mutual aid, or had collapsed last year and had not been reorganized, effectively only existing on paper. Therefore, productivity cannot be improved, increasing production difficulties. The reason for the spontaneous nature of mutual aid is that cadres do not delve into practical leadership. For example, after the cadres of Fengbeidi village in the Fourth District returned from a base point meeting, they did not study the masses' thoughts or delve into mobilizing the masses, only calling a mass meeting and telling the masses about voluntary mutual aid and checking planting. No family in the masses participated in mutual aid. The cadres simply said that the masses were not moving themselves and that there was nothing they could do, so they didn't care. The Fifth District's Nan Zhang village party secretary has been bedridden since spring, and does not even attend meetings notified by the district, so production in the village is scattered and spontaneous. Some difficulties were originally caused by administrative orders and forced rushes in last year's mutual aid, without equivalent exchange or fairness. However, some cadres one-sidedly believe that mutual aid has no benefits at all. The masses are unwilling to engage in mutual aid. The common demand in rural areas now is to rest and recuperate. They fear pointless meetings called by cadres and also fear being forced to organize mutual aid that is unprofitable for them, which is a great burden on them. Failure to correct this will greatly harm production. The masses in Zhao village in the Fifth District said, "Even without mutual aid this year, we can still weed the seedlings on time." The masses in Canghe said, "When it rains, there is no need for the higher-ups to push us. We can work in the fields even without mutual aid." Some said, "Mutual aid is just cadres being subjective and adding trouble to the masses." This is the masses' reaction to forced mutual aid. However, as long as the principles of equivalent exchange and voluntarism are implemented, the masses still welcome mutual aid and labor exchange. Cadres, because they do not understand this, lose their direction when they see the masses being scattered and dissatisfied, and they become discouraged and give up.

　　　　III. Problems in Solving Difficulties and Strengthening Leadership

First, disaster relief, compensating wrongly labeled households, and resettling landlords and rich peasants to solve specific difficulties in production have generally begun in the First, Second, and Third Districts and will soon begin in the Fourth and Fifth Districts. However, because there is too little wheat land (wheat land accounts for only about one-tenth of the total cultivated land in the Fourth and Fifth Districts), there are still many wrongly labeled households and landlords and rich peasants who do not have wheat land. How to solve their difficulties, organize their production, and lay the foundation for production before the autumn harvest is still an important issue.

Second, to improve village-level leadership, it is necessary to simultaneously solve the cadre problem. From the perspective of the Fourth District, there are several situations among village cadres: (1) In many villages, cadres have prestige among the masses, the leadership generally maintains a tight grip, the masses' emotions are stable, and production is active, such as in Nan Song and Taiyizhang in the Fifth District. (2) Some cadres have minor shortcomings, but after criticism, they are willing to discuss solutions with the masses and continue working. However, because the higher authorities have failed to provide specific leadership, they feel timid and insecure in their work. They want to conduct self-criticism and resolve the problems, but no one takes the lead. (3) There are also a few villages where the masses are seriously dissatisfied with certain cadres, but the cadres are still not aware of it, do not want to conduct self-criticism and correction to the masses, but want to delay and shirk the issue, and are passively indifferent to their work.

Third, the issue of equivalent mutual benefit in mutual aid: One is the issue of feeding livestock together. For example, Gao Huai of Beipo sold his grain and jointly bought livestock with Youcai. Youcai fed the livestock and only used them for his own transportation, without Huai getting a penny. In Nan Zhang, one group broke up the livestock and cart into separate pieces because of conflicting interests. Other villages also have similar problems. Another issue is profit sharing and equivalent exchange. For example, the agricultural association chairman in Nan Song and his small group jointly bought livestock to engage in transportation, distributing profits based on 30% for labor and 70% for capital, regardless of how much labor was contributed. Households that contributed more labor suffered losses and were dissatisfied, while households that contributed less labor benefited for nothing. In Fengbeidi village in the Fourth District, workers earn one dou of rice (16 jin) per day for blacksmithing, while the mutual aid wage is only five jin of rice per day. The coordination between agriculture and industry is not working well. Workers have to stop the furnace if they want to farm, and they have to let the land go to waste if they want to blacksmith. Some farmers, seeing that the workers earn more and they cannot share in the profits, are unwilling to participate in mutual aid and only care about finishing their own land. Another issue is the problem of households in difficulty: Households who were struggled against and households in difficulty must be helped, but if the mutual aid group collectively provides labor without pay, or without meals, or with less pay, it will form a one-sided favor, which cannot be consolidated in the long term. In the past, the leadership often emphasized this kind of one-sided care, forming coercion and undermining the principle of equivalent exchange, which often became the reason for the collapse of mutual aid. However, if they are not taken care of, the problems cannot be solved. It is hoped that all localities will study and develop appropriate solutions.

　　长治生产中的几个问题
    长治生产运动，当前正处在锄苗、麦收改茬、追肥耧地的紧张关头。为了领导上能够及时的解决当前运动中存在的困难，使生产运动前进一步，特将今春领导春耕较早的四、五区的生产情况及问题写出，以供研究。
    　　　　一、当前的生产困难
    长治四、五区一般村庄在五月初就已全部完成下种。漏下的荒地很少。据四区十八掌、山后、平家庄、峰北底等四个村的检查，总共不超过十亩。但当前的生产中存在着以下几个困难：（一）部分被错斗户没吃喝，个别孤寡户无力出工资。根据六月十五号五区南宋、北宋等九个村汇报，错斗户在下种时经过初步补偿、被斗地富经过安置后，目前又有困难发生。北苍壑村七十八户，当下吃喝顾不住的有二十户，南宋村有二十六户。北宋、南宋已借出部分粮食和贷款，解决了一部分人的困难。有些村庄因条件限制，到现在还未解决。生活困难直接影响了生产。南宋圪挤孩家种着二亩多谷，因怕出不起工资，对互助组说：“锄完锄不完，反正只出五个工票。”有些被斗户光顾闹吃喝，自己地只是过过锄，勉强荒不了就行。（二）春耕下种粗糙，现在锄地误工。四区二十六个主村（全区共三十九个）统计，春季种玉茭时，因为某些群众思想有顾虑，劳畜力困难，准备粗糙，没有犁过就种上的硬地有二万二千多亩，其中玉茭有四千九百多亩。双岗村共种玉茭六百多亩，硬地种的就有五百多亩，小苗一般发育不旺。现在要想补救就得上追肥、加工。南宋军属保山老汉硬地种三亩谷，光锄头遍就用了互助组十五个工，比过去多用一倍。（三）追肥准备一般不足。五区赵村种玉茭一千二百多亩，追肥只准备了圊粪、圈粪一万零四百担，能上地六百多亩，只够一半。北宋玉茭地六百一十亩，一大部分没法上追肥。
    　　　　二、造成以上困难的原因
    除过天然原因外，领导上的原因主要是生产互助自流。四区二十六个主村，组织起来的数字不小，但实际情况不是这样：山后村汇报说大多数都组织起来了，实际上全村还没有一个组活动。峰北底村八十多户，只有六户组成的一个小组。五区南基点比较好的太义掌、东掌等四个村，互助组七十多个，实际在一起活动的只有三十六个。其它有的是光有组长没有互助，有的是去年垮了就没整理，实际上只顶着一个数字。因此生产力不能提高，增加了生产困难。互助自流的原因是干部不深入实际领导。如四区峰北底村干部从基点开会回来，不研究群众思想，也不深入发动群众，光是召集了个群众大会，给群众说了一下自愿互助，检查下种；群众没有一家互助，干部光是群众自己不动，没有办法，也就不管了。五区南掌村支书从春天躺倒，区上通知开会也不参加，村上生产散漫自流。有些困难，本来是去年互助中行政命令，强制突击，不等价、公平所造成的，有些干部却片面的认为互助根本就没有好处。群众不愿意互助，现在农村普遍要求，是休养生息，他们最怕干部开无益的会，同样怕强制他们组织对他们本人无利的互助，这对他们是个大负担，不纠正将大大损害生产。五区赵村群众说：“今年没有互助，小苗也拔的不迟。”苍壑群众说：“天下了雨，上边不用推动，不互助也能上地。”有的说：“互助就是干部主观，给群众添麻烦。”这是群众对强迫互助的反映。但只要实行等价自愿的原则，群众仍然是欢迎互助变工的。干部因为不了解这个，所以一看到群众散漫不满，自己就没了主意，打退堂鼓，也不干了。
    　　　　三、解决困难、加强领导中的问题
    第一、救灾与补偿错斗户和安置被斗户，解决生产中的具体困难，一、二、三区已普遍开始，四、五区也即将开始。但因麦地太少（四、五区麦地约占总耕地十分之一左右），部分错斗户及地主富农没有麦地的尚多，如何解决其困难，组织其生产，打下秋前生产的基础，还是一个重要问题。
    第二、健全村级领导，要同时解决干部问题。从四区来看，村干部有几种情况：（一）不少村庄干部在群众中有威信，领导上一般抓的紧，群众情绪稳定，生产积极。如五区南宋、太义掌等。（二）干部有些小毛病，经过批评，愿意与群众商谈解决，愿意继续工作；但因上级未能具体领导，自己觉得胆子小，工作不安心。想检讨解决，可是没人作主。（三）也有少数村庄群众对某些干部严重不满，但干部至今不觉悟，不想向群众检讨改正，却想拖延推托过去，对工作是消极不管。
    第三、互助中的等价互利问题：一个是伙喂牲口问题。如北坡高怀的卖了粮食与有才合买了个牲口，有才喂上光自己运输，怀的一个钱得不上。南掌有一个组因为利益不合，好几股把牲口车套零散分开了。其它村也有这类问题。另一个是分红，等价问题，如南宋农会主席小组合资买牲口头搞运输，按劳三资七分红，不管入工多少都是一样分，入工多的户吃亏不满意，入工少的户就白得了利。四区峰北底村工人打铁，一人一天能赚一斗米（十六斤），互助工资一天才五斤米。农业工业配合不上，工人要种地就得停炉，要打铁就得荒地。一部分农民看着工人赚的多，自己分不上，不愿意互助，只管自己地种完就算。再一个是困难户问题：被斗户和困难户必须帮助，但如果互助组集体送工不要工资，或不吃饭，或少要工资，就形成单方面照顾，绝不能长期巩固。过去领导上时常强调这种片面照顾，形成强制，破坏了等价原则，时常成为互助垮台的原因。但如果不照顾，问题又没法解决，希各地研究妥善办法。
