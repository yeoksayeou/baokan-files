　　Malayan People Resist British Persecution
    Several British Officials Killed in Mass Riots
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi on the 19th, citing Indian newspaper reports: A mass movement against British oppressive policies and ethnic discrimination has occurred in Malaya. Several British colonial officials, rubber plantation owners, speculators, and usurers were killed in the riots. The center of the struggle is in northern Malaya. The Delhi newspaper "The Statesman" pointed out: The political situation in Malaya is "unquestionably serious."
    The occurrence of this Malayan incident is a reaction to the British ruling authorities' adoption of economic plundering and anti-communist, anti-democratic persecution policies. Since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the British authorities in Malaya have adopted various policies in the economic field, such as levying income taxes, freezing wages, purchasing farmers' rice at low prices, monopolizing tin and rubber trade, and controlling foreign trade. In politics, Britain implemented the so-called "Malayan New Deal"; held illegal elections in Singapore; prohibited gatherings on this year's May Day; and provoked Malays to exclude Chinese, wooed Indians, appeased upper-class overseas Chinese, and colluded with Chiang Kai-shek government secret agents to attack progressive forces among overseas Chinese and other reactionary measures.
    Various sources indicate that after the Malayan incident occurred, the British colonial authorities, under the pretext of a so-called "communist rebellion conspiracy," successively adopted various methods of suppression. Moreover, British sources fabricated that the Chinese Communist Party participated in the Malayan incident, the purpose of which was obviously to find an excuse for the British ruling authorities to further suppress the movement of all ethnic groups in Malaya to strive for liberation. On the 10th of this month, the British authorities in Malaya arrested Liu Yifan, the representative of the Malayan Communist Party in Kuala Lumpur and manager of the MCP's organ, the Min Sheng Bao, and on the 16th, the Min Sheng Bao was closed down. At the same time, the authorities also disbanded the Malayan Federation of Trade Unions (note: the association is a pillar of the Malayan democratic movement, with 450,000 members last year, and joined the World Federation of Trade Unions in September 1946), and arrested an Indian leader of the Ipoh Rubber Industry Workers' Union. On the 16th, the British High Commissioner in Malaya, Gurney, announced martial law in three regions of Johor and one region of Perak. On the 17th, the martial law was extended to all nine states of the "Malay Federation." The martial law granted the military police so-called "special emergency powers," including the power to impose the death penalty, arrest, detain, and expel those arrested from the relevant areas, prohibit gatherings, search persons and houses, cut off land and water transportation, and requisition buildings and vehicles. On the 21st, the British authorities launched a large-scale arrest throughout Malaya. The Associated Press reported that more than 300 people were arrested, including 113 in Selangor, 60 in Perak, 50 in Johor, 30 in Negeri Sembilan, and 60 in Penang and Wellesley Province. The MCP headquarters in Kuala Lumpur and several of its branches, several offices of the New Democratic Youth League, the Malayan Veterans Association, and several trade unions were also searched by the police. On the 23rd, the so-called "emergency measures" were further extended to Singapore City, where the headquarters of the New Democratic Youth League and the Singapore Trade Union were also searched, and six people were arrested in the city.
    TASS, citing news from the Telegraph Agency, stated that after the Malayan incident occurred, many British Labour Party members of parliament were shocked by the suppression. TASS also stated that there is sufficient evidence to show that neither the feudal elements of Malaya nor the right-wing nationalists of Burma can suppress the people who demand social and economic liberation, who demand to get rid of the enslavement of the British and other foreign monopolists who hold most of the rich resources in Southeast Asia, and who seek true independence.

　　马来亚人民反英迫害
    若干英籍官员在群众暴动中被击毙
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据塔斯社十九日德里电引印度报纸消息称：马来亚发生反抗英国压迫政策及民族歧视的群众运动。若干英籍殖民地官员、树胶园主、投机商及高利贷者在暴动中被击毙。斗争中心在马来亚北部。德里报纸“政论家”指出：马来亚政治情形“毫无问题的严重。”
    此次马来亚事件的发生，系英国统治当局采取经济掠夺及反共反民主的迫害政策的反响。抗日战争结束以来，马来亚英当局在经济上采取了征收所得税、冻结工资、低价收买农民米粮，垄断锡、树胶贸易，统制对外贸易的各种政策。在政治上，英国实施了所谓“马来亚新政制”；举行新加坡的非法选举；禁止今年五一节的集会；并挑拨马来人排斥华人，拉拢印人，怀柔华侨上层分子，勾结蒋政府特务分子打击华侨进步力量等反动措施。
    各方消息指出：当马来亚事件发生之后，英国殖民当局以所谓“共产党叛乱阴谋”为借口，接连采取了各种各样的镇压办法。不仅如此，英国方面的消息，更捏造中国共产党参与此次马来亚事件，其目的显然为英国统治当局进一步镇压马来亚各民族争取解放的运动寻找借口。本月十日，马来亚英国当局逮捕了马来亚共产党驻吉隆坡代表兼马共机关报民声报经理刘一帆，十六日复将民声报查封。与此同时，当局又解散了马来亚工会联合会（按该会系马来亚民主运动的支柱，去年拥有会员四十五万，于一九四六年九月加入世界职工联盟），并拘捕了怡保胶业工人工会的印籍领袖。十六日，英驻马来亚高级专员金德宣布，在柔佛州的三个地区和霹雳州的一个地区戒严。十七日，戒严令复被扩及于“马来联邦”全境的九个州。戒严令授予军警以所谓“特别紧急权力”。包括可以判处死刑、逮捕、拘留及自有关区域放逐被捕者，禁止集会，搜查人身及房屋，断绝水陆交通及征用建筑物与舟车等。二十一日，英国当局更在马来亚全境发动了大搜捕。美联社称，被捕者达三百人以上，计雪兰峨州逮捕一一三人，霹雳州逮捕六十人，柔佛州逮捕五十人，森美兰州逮捕三十人，槟榔屿及威士利州逮捕六十人。吉隆坡马共总部及其若干分部，新民主青年同盟若干办事处，马来亚退伍军人协会及若干工会亦俱被警察搜查。二十三日，所谓“紧急措施”更扩及于新加坡市，该地之新民主青年同盟总部及新加坡职工会亦被搜查，全市并有六人被捕。
    塔斯社引电报通讯社消息称：马来亚事件发生之后，许多英国工党议员对此次镇压行动甚为震惊。塔斯社并称，有足够的证据说明，不论是马来亚的封建分子，或是缅甸的右冀民族主义人士，对于那些要求社会及经济解放、要求摆脱在东南亚握有大部富源地区的英国及其他外国垄断家奴役而取得真正独立的人民，是压制不了的。
