　　Specific Problems in "Who Sows, Who Reaps" Should Be Resolved Through Consultation with the Masses

To the Editor:
    During the wheat harvest, our village carried out land adjustments. After the adjustments, the work team announced to the masses that crops planted in the spring would be handled according to the principle of "who sows, who reaps." Crops planted within the wheat fields would belong to whomever the land was allocated to, with the land recipient compensating the original farmer for labor, seeds, and planting. This regulation was primarily intended to compensate middle peasants who were wrongly classified during the land reform. However, after the announcement, some people were dissatisfied, saying, "The Border Region Government's proclamation said 'who sows, who reaps.' Why has it changed again!" It’s impossible to explain to the masses. If we follow "who sows, who reaps," the compensation for wrongly classified middle peasants becomes a problem. If we don't follow "who sows, who reaps," it's impossible to explain to the masses. What should we do?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Agricultural Representatives of Shangxian Village, Shahe

To the Agricultural Representatives of Shangxian Village, Shahe:
    During land adjustments, the principle of "who sows, who reaps" should be implemented. However, when specific problems arise, the work team should consult with the local masses and, based on the specific circumstances, devise reasonable solutions that do not violate the principle of "who sows, who reaps" and do not contradict the Border Region Government's proclamation. These solutions should then be submitted to higher authorities for approval. Your village made a decision and announcement solely through the work team without mobilizing the masses to discuss and resolve the issue themselves, which naturally led to dissatisfaction. We hope you will revisit this issue with the masses, listen to their opinions, decide on a solution, and submit it to higher authorities for approval.

### 谁种谁收中的具体问题应商同群众解决

专栏：询问与答复

　　谁种谁收中的具体问题应商同群众解决编辑同志：
    我村于麦收时进行了土地的抽补，抽补后工作组向群众宣布今年春地下种之庄稼按照谁种谁收之规定执行，在麦垄内点种之庄稼，土地分给谁就归谁所有，由得地人给原耕种人出工资籽种，这个规定主要是为了补偿错斗中农，但宣布后有些群众很不满意的说：“过去边府布告说谁种谁收，为什么又变了！”也没法向群众解释，要按照谁种谁收来执行，错斗中农的补偿就成了问题，如不按谁种谁收执行就没法向群众解释，到底该怎么办请答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　沙河尚贤村农代会
    沙河尚贤村农代会：在抽补土地时，应该执行谁种谁收的原则。但还有具体问题时，则工作组应会同当地群众，根据具体情况，在不违反谁种谁收的原则及和边府布告不抵触的条件下，商定合理解决办法，并呈请上级批准，你村单只由工作组决定宣布，而未发动群众自己讨论解决，自然会使群众不满，希望你们再把这问题和群众一起研究，听取群众意见，决定处理办法并呈请上级批准。
