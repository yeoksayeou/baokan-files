　　Cannons Instead of Butter!
    Soviet Pravda Comments on US Huge Military Spending Allocations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd dispatch] TASS, June 24th dispatch, Pravda's observer recently commented on the U.S. Congress's recent decision to pass huge military spending allocations in an article titled "Cannons Instead of Butter," stating: The new military allocations indicate large-scale orders will be placed with aircraft, shipbuilding, motorcycle, munitions production companies, and chemical plants. But who will bear the cost of these orders? There is only one answer to this question, namely the already overburdened American taxpayers—the American people—due to various taxes. U.S. federal tax revenue now reaches $46 billion annually, compared to $44 billion during the war and only slightly over $5 billion in 1939. The U.S. ruling clique does not conceal their intention to shift all "emergency" expenditures (whose purpose is to delay the crisis) onto the working people. The President's Economic Committee stated in its first-quarter report this year: Due to the increase in military spending, the American people must temporarily abandon the hope of improving their living standards after the war. The observer concluded: Thanks to the startling candor of the President's advisors, the American rulers have revived Goering's slogan of "cannons instead of butter."

　　大炮代替了牛油！
    苏真理报评美巨额军费拨款
    【新华社陕北二日电】塔斯社六月二十四日电，真理报观察家顷以“大炮代替了牛油”为题，评论美国国会最近通过以巨额拨款充作军费的决定称：新的军事拨款，表示将向飞机、造船、摩托、军火生产公司与化学工厂大批定货。但这批定单的经费是出在谁身上呢？这个问题只有一个答案，即出在已因各种捐税而负担过重的美国纳税人——美国老百姓的身上。美国联邦税收现在每年达四百六十亿美元，战时为四百四十亿元，一九三九年则仅为五十余亿元。美国统治集团并不隐讳他们将一切“紧急状态”开支（其目的在于延缓危机）转嫁于劳动人民身上的意向，总统经济委员会在其今年第一季报告中说：由于军费的增加，美国人民暂时必须放弃在战后提高生活水准的希望。观察家结语称：感谢总统顾问们惊人的坦白，美国统治者已复活了戈林的“大炮代替牛油”的口号。
