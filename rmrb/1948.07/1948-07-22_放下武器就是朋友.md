　　【Jidong Telegram】In June of this year, parts of the Kuomintang army's 62nd Army, 157th Division, and 151st Division were liberated by the People's Liberation Army in the areas of Zhenzi Town in Luan County, Yejituo in Tangshan, and Rengezhuang. Before being liberated, the officers and soldiers of this Guangdong unit, like other Kuomintang officers and soldiers, were deceived by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda, and many of them doubted the People's Liberation Army's policy towards prisoners. But now, from their own personal experience, they have understood the true situation. Guo Jiesheng, the company commander of the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 151st Division, recalled happily: "As soon as I laid down my weapon, the People's Liberation Army brothers said to me: 'If you lay down your weapon, we are friends. Don't worry, don't be afraid.' Their attitude was very kind, which immediately changed my impression of the People's Liberation Army. But I still had 19 million in legal tender and a watch on me, and I thought: the People's Liberation Army will definitely take these, and I will never be able to keep them. So I gave my watch to a People's Liberation Army brother, but that brother immediately shook his head and said, 'That's not allowed. The discipline of our People's Liberation Army does not allow this.'" Wu Hua, the company commander of the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 451st Regiment, used to be skeptical about the People's Liberation Army's lenient policy. When he was about to be liberated, he thought: the People's Liberation Army would probably be unkind to captured officers, so he changed his clothes, threw away the American herringbone wool hat he was wearing, put on a hat from a logistics soldier, and also threw away his clothes and blankets. Now he says regretfully: "What a pity! If I had known that the People's Liberation Army would treat us who laid down our weapons so well, I would have brought everything with me." He Chunbin, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 471st Regiment, knew a little about the People's Liberation Army's lenient policy, so he was not very afraid after laying down his weapon, and brought his clothes, quilt, blanket, and rucksack, and even brought a thermos. And he continued to write a diary along the way. In his diary, he wrote: "The People's Liberation Army prepared cars to carry the luggage that we couldn't carry and the officers and soldiers who couldn't walk. What was most unexpected was that when we were tired and couldn't carry our luggage, the People's Liberation Army soldiers would carry it for us. This is absolutely impossible in our army (referring to the Kuomintang army)."

　　放下武器就是朋友
    【冀东电】今年六月间，蒋军六十二军一五七师和一五一师各一部，在滦县榛子镇，唐山野鸡坨、任各庄一带，被人民解放军解放了。这个广东部队的官兵在被解放以前，也和其他蒋军官兵一样，因受蒋介石的宣传欺骗，很多人怀疑解放军的俘虏政策，但是现在从他们自己亲身的经验中，使他们明白了真实的情形。一五一师二营六连连长郭杰生很愉快的回忆说：“我一放下武器，解放军弟兄们就对我说：‘你放下了武器，我们就是朋友了，放心吧，不要怕。’他们的态度很和好，使我对解放军的印象马上不同。不过我身上还有一千九百万法币和一只手表，我心想：这些一定被解放军拿去，我再也保不住它们了。我就把我的手表送给一个解放军弟兄，那弟兄马上摇头说：‘这可不行，我们解放军的纪律不允许这样。’”四五一团一营三连长伍花以前对解放军的宽大政策半信半疑，在快被解放的时候，心想：解放军捉住当官的大概不客气，于是他就换了装，把头上戴的美国人字呢帽扔掉，拿勤务兵的一顶帽子戴上，同时还把衣服毯子都扔掉。现在他懊悔地说：“真可惜！早知解放军对我们放下武器的人这样好，我什么也会带着。”四七一团三营营长何淳斌因为略微知道一点解放军的宽大政策，所以放下武器后并不很害怕，把自己的衣服、被子、毛毯图囊都带着，连暖水瓶也拿来了。并且一路上还照常写日记。在他的日记上写着：“在行进中我们背不动的行李及走不得的官兵，解放军都预备着车子载运。最出人意料的是，当我们累了背不动行李时，解放军战士们还替我们背。我们部队里（即指蒋军里）是绝对做不到的。”
