(North Yue News) Lingshou has not had rain for a long time and is showing signs of drought. The County Party Committee issued emergency instructions a few days ago, calling on all cadres to lead the masses in repairing water conservancy and fighting the drought. The instructions stated: In our county's Lingzheng Canal, there is a chaotic situation of opening the gates to steal water, with the upstream not caring about the downstream, and agreements are not being enforced; the Tanzhuang Canal Water Committee is just a formality, lacking leadership, the canal body has not been repaired in a timely manner, and water use is not fair or reasonable. Other canals also have varying degrees of undisciplined, unscientific, and unreasonable phenomena. Wells also exist in an unled and unorganized state, with some people able to water every day while others are anxiously waiting. The instructions pointed out: Water committees of each canal should be immediately organized and rectified, with division of responsibilities, and immediate repairs should be made. Each district should send special personnel to lead. A representative meeting of villages benefiting from the canals should be convened to formulate scientific and reasonable management methods and disciplines and systems that everyone should abide by in the future. Leaders should be fully prepared in advance and submit a relatively complete draft for discussion at the representative meeting, and should not endlessly argue at the meeting, so that the problem cannot be resolved perfectly. The Party Committee and the government should cooperate with the Water Committee to lead the meeting. Organize wells: In Shangshao Village, District Four, each well should have one person as the well head, and the whole village should set up a well committee to solve the problem of water use separately. Make sure the windlass is never away from the well, and use it in shifts day and night. This method can be used as a reference.

　　整修水利抗旱
    灵寿县委紧急指示
    【北岳讯】灵寿久未落雨，已呈旱象。县委在日前发出紧急指示，号召全体干部，领导群众整修水利，与旱象作斗争。指示称：我县灵正渠存在开闸盗水，上游不管下游，订出公约不执行的混乱状态；谭庄渠道水委会形同虚设，漫无领导，渠身没有及时兴修，用水也欠公平合理。其他渠道也都有程度不同的无纪律、不科学，不合理的现象。水井同样存在无领导无组织状态，有人能天天浇，有人则干着急。指示指出：应立即组织与整顿各渠道的水委会，分工负责，立即兴修，各区要派专人去领导。召开渠道受益村的代表会，制定今后科学合理的管理办法和全体遵守的纪律与制度。领导者事先要有充分准备，提出较完备之草案交代表会讨论，不应漫无休止的在会上争吵，使问题不得完善解决。党委与政府应协同水委会去领导会议。组织水井：四区上邵村每井设一人为井头，全村设水井委员会，分别解决使水问题。作到辘辘不离井，日夜分班使用，这种办法可供参考。
