Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 13th: TASS, Prague, July 3rd: The Telegraph Agency has recently revealed the inside story of the British newspapers' propaganda about the "Communist threat" in Southeast Asia, stating that British monopoly groups, fearing the loss of their profits, readily resort to the monster of the "Communist threat." Britain is using the fraudulent trick of the so-called "Communist conspiracy" as a pretext for its massive suppression of trade unions and destruction of the remaining democratic freedoms. Martial law has been declared, and open terror is rampant in Malaya, with approximately a thousand people arrested in the past week. The agency continued: After the war, Malaya is particularly important to Britain, and Malaya is creating a large amount of wealth for Britain. However, the United States has recently intervened in Malaya and is taking over control of Malayan rubber and tin resources. British tin and rubber companies are caught between two millstones – on one side is American control over prices, and on the other side is the struggle of the working masses to increase wages and living standards and to gain recognition of trade unions. Therefore, Britain is losing its hope of restoring its pre-war position; before the war, Britain was able to colonize Malaya as it pleased. This is the reason why Britain is imposing drastic suppression on the labor movement as the first step in suppressing the wages and living standards of the Malayan people.

　　英国在马来亚的阴谋
    用所谓“共党威胁”的欺骗宣传作镇压工运及破坏民主的托词
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社布拉格三日讯：电报通讯社顷揭露英国报纸关于东南亚“共产党威胁”之宣传的内幕称：英国垄断集团唯恐丧失其利润，而动辄使用“共产党威胁”这一怪物。英国运用所谓“共产党阴谋”这一欺诈手法，作为其大肆镇压工会及破坏残剩的民主自由之托词。戒严已经宣布，公开恐怖正弥漫于马来亚，在上星期内已约有千人被捕。该通讯社继称：战后马来亚对英国特别重要，马来亚正在给英国制造大量财富。但美国近来已插足马来亚，并正在接收对马来亚树胶及锡矿资源的控制。英国锡业及树胶业公司已处在两块磨石的夹缝中——一面是美国对价格的控制，另一面是劳动群众争取提高工资及生活水准、并争取承认工会的斗争，因此，英国正在丧失其恢复战前地位的希望；战前英国是能随心所欲地拓殖马来亚的。这就是英国对劳工运动强施剧烈镇压，作为抑低马来亚人民工资及生活水准的第一个步骤的原因。
