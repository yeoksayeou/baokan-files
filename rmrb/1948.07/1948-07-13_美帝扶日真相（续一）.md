　　The Truth About US Imperialism Supporting Japan (Continued One)
  　　　　　8. Delaying the Peace Treaty with Japan; Secret US-Japan Treaty Agreement
    Last October, the American "World Report" weekly published a memorandum from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the peace treaty with Japan. Its main points were: (1) Japan requests to attend the peace conference to conclude a "negotiated peace treaty," rather than a peace treaty based on unconditional surrender. (2) After the peace treaty is signed, the supervision by the Allied powers should be limited to the ambassadors of the four major powers, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China, and should be conducted through diplomatic means, without directly interfering in Japanese politics. (3) Japan should retain the Kuril Islands; at least the southern Kuril Islands and the Habomai Islands, which are assigned to the Soviet Union, must remain Japanese territory. The Ryukyu Islands, southwestern Pacific islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and the islands near the Japanese mainland should, as far as possible, not be ceded and should belong to Japan. However, if certain Allied countries actively request these islands for military purposes, they can be leased for a certain period, but compensation must be paid. (4) Except for military factories, Japanese production should not be restricted. (5) Japanese foreign trade should not be subject to any restrictions. (6) Japan should retain 4 million tons of merchant ships and should possess aircraft. (7) Japan should have more armed police. (8) Japanese assets in neutral countries should not be used as reparations. (9) Japan will not compensate for losses suffered by the Allied powers in Japanese-occupied areas and Japan's occupation costs.
    According to a TASS report from Rome on March 1 this year, the Roman newspaper "La Repubblica" revealed a secret agreement between the United States and Japan regarding the peace treaty. The newspaper pointed out that, according to the agreement reached by the US and Japanese representatives, after the peace treaty comes into effect, the Japanese government will (1) first lease the Ryukyu Islands and Tsushima Island to the United States for a period of 66 years, and allow the United States to establish land and naval bases in Kyushu and Hokkaido, Japan. (2) The United States has investment privileges in Japan's major and secondary industries. (3) Japan abandons its property in Latin America and transfers it to the United States. In return, the United States will support Japan's following proposals in the peace conference: (1) Maintain Japan's existing industrial equipment and allow it to be expanded subsequently. (2) Allow the import of raw materials needed by Japanese industry. (3) Abolish any restrictions on Japanese industry and its foreign trade. (4) Exempt reparations from Japan's foreign assets in neutral countries and current industrial production. (5) Japan has the right to postpone payment of goods to China. (6) Exempt Japan from compensation for Allied assets in Japanese-occupied areas and compensation for occupation costs in these areas. On the recommendation of MacArthur's headquarters, Japan has submitted its counter-proposal for the peace treaty (referring to the aforementioned secret memorandum) to observe the reaction of the Allied powers. In addition to this, the Japanese government has also submitted other proposals to MacArthur's headquarters regarding the military, industry, war potential, merchant ships, and part of the navy. The United States has already approved the above additional proposals.
    　　　　The conspiracy to achieve long-term occupation by delaying the peace treaty
    On the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, the United States violated the provision that the foreign ministers' conference of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom should first discuss the peace treaty. On July 11 last year, without the consent of the three major powers, China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, the United States unilaterally sent a note to the other ten countries in the Far East, inviting them to participate in the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, and arbitrarily advocated the method of voting by a two-thirds majority to abolish the principle of unanimous agreement of the four powers. The United States insists on this unreasonable proposition, its purpose is to "deliberately obstruct the holding of a peace conference" in order to "handle Japan alone, and after all its plans are completed, convene a peace conference, at which time the United States can put forward Japan's situation as a fait accompli." (United Press, Washington, May 23)
    According to a United Press report from Washington on May 30, US Undersecretary of State Lovett told Dening, Assistant Undersecretary of the British Foreign Office in charge of Far Eastern affairs, that "the United States does not intend to take the initiative to try to open the deadlock between China, the Soviet Union, and the British United Nations regarding the procedures for convening the Japanese Peace Conference." The United States' refusal to initiate the opening of the deadlock in the Japanese Peace Conference has made Britain quite apprehensive. Denning's talks with Lovett and others have so far led to the belief that there is little possibility of convening the Japanese Peace Conference in the foreseeable future.
    On June 14, the Central News Agency rebroadcast a United Press message from Washington, saying that "official beliefs here about the expectation of concluding a peace treaty with Japan have changed, and this issue has been shelved."
    Even the Chiang Kai-shek's Central Daily News revealed the US's purpose in delaying the peace treaty on May 14. On that day, it published an article entitled "How the United States Supports Japan." This article was translated and compiled based on materials from the American "Newsweek" and "World Report Weekly." After listing various facts about the US's support for Japan, the translator wrote under the subheading "The situation of delay is extremely beneficial to Japan": "The convening of the peace conference with Japan is still far away. The United States is not in a hurry to sign a peace treaty with Japan and give up the power it is currently exercising in Japan. On the contrary, it hopes to maintain the current informal state of peace in order to 'transform' Japan into a reliable ally in troubled Asia."
    On January 21 this year, Xinhua News Agency exposed the US's conspiracy to occupy Japan for a long time. Xinhua News Agency reported:
    Shanghai News: In November last year, MacArthur's headquarters and Japanese government officials successively announced a "shocking news," saying that there was a "secret government" in Japan, and that the US occupying forces and its so-called "Japan reform plan" were being "severely threatened" by the "extensive underground movement" of this so-called "secret government." The real intention of MacArthur's trick is to deliberately create a chaotic situation and a tense atmosphere, so as to prove that the US imperialists must occupy Japan indefinitely. This point has now been exposed by commentators in Shanghai. According to the news of the so-called Japanese "secret government," it was officially reported by MacArthur's headquarters in November last year. Colonel Cadwell, deputy director of the US military government, declared in a statement: The current basic political struggle is being carried out "between the supremacy of law and the secret rule of gangsters, the latter is using people from all camps such as former diplomats, members of parliament, and industrialists." At the same time, the confidants of Japanese Prime Minister Katayama explained that these underground lurking elements were former army and navy officers who were unwilling to accept defeat, so they organized an underground government. The Japanese government spokesman explained that this fact was a "natural product of the failure to restore economic stability after the war." In order to resist this situation, "some Japanese leaders even advocated that the US occupying forces should not withdraw even after the peace treaty is signed."
    Commentators in Shanghai believe that this remark by the Japanese spokesman, who was described by Reuters' Tokyo correspondent at the time as "closest to Prime Minister Katayama," has completely revealed the conspiracy of the reactionary factions of the United States and Japan. The person pointed out that the entire conspiracy of the US imperialists is to occupy Japan for a long time as a base for aggression against the nations of the East. This conspiracy is not only manifested in the propaganda of the so-called Japanese "secret government," but also in MacArthur's entire policy of deliberately creating a domestic political and economic crisis in Japan. The so-called Japanese army and navy officers, former diplomats, members of parliament, industrialists, etc., who are related to the secret government and accused of being used by gangsters, are not used by any gangsters, but are precisely used by MacArthur, the number one gangster. MacArthur not only indulges but also actively uses this group of war criminals, making them and his other group of lackeys, Katayama and others, play a puppet show of mutual fighting, so that the United States can extend the occupation period as much as possible in the chaos, which is no longer a secret.
    The person further pointed out that MacArthur's strategy is consistent with MacArthur's suggestion to Marshall. MacArthur suggested that the time for the occupation of Japan must be extended, and for this reason, the signing of the peace treaty with Japan must be delayed under various pretexts. MacArthur believes that the United States must maintain US troops and US naval and air bases in Japan, China, and Korea, and even after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, the US military power should still be retained in order to completely consolidate the US position in the Far East. MacArthur also believes that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to continue to deepen the deterioration of Japan's political and economic situation and strengthen the propaganda of Japan's tense situation, so that public opinion feels that the US long-term occupation of Japan is forced and justified. Commentators in Shanghai especially remind the Chinese people to pay attention to the fact that MacArthur's conspiracy is now being actively carried out, and the US government's unreasonable behavior of deliberately canceling the four-power veto and convening the so-called eleven-nation conference to replace the four-nation conference on the peace conference with Japan, making the peace conference with Japan impossible to start, is completely in line with this conspiracy. The US policy of delaying the peace conference with Japan is obviously serving the same purpose as its policy of occupying Japan, that is, occupying Japan indefinitely to invade the nations of the East.

　　美帝扶日真相（续一）
  　　　　　八、拖延对日和约　美日秘密和约协议
    去年十月美国“世界报导”周刊发表了日本外务省关于对日和约的备忘录，其要点为：（一）日本要求出席和会，以缔结一个“谈判的和约”，而非以无条件投降为基础的和约。（二）和约签字后，盟国的监督仅限于美、苏、英、中四强大使，并须以外交方式为之，不得直接干涉日本政治。（三）日本应保持千岛群岛，至少划归苏联之南千岛群岛及色列群岛必须仍属于日本；琉球、西南太平洋群岛、小笠原群岛及日本本土附近之岛屿，应尽量不使之割让而属于日本，但如若干盟国积极要求此等岛屿供作军事之用时，可以租借一定时期，但须付给报酬。（四）除军事工厂外，日本生产应不受限制。（五）日本对外贸易应不受任何限制。（六）日本应保有商船四百万吨，并应拥有飞机。（七）日本应有较多之武装警察。（八）日本在中立国之资产不得作为赔款。（九）日本不偿还盟国前在日占区所受之损失及日本之占领费。
    又据塔斯社罗马今年三月一日电，罗马“共和报”曾揭露美日间关于和约之秘密协定。该报指出：按照美日代表所获之协议，日本政府于和约生效后（一）首先将琉球群岛及对马岛租与美国，为期六十六年，并准许美国在日本九州及北海道建立陆海军基地。（二）美国对日本主要工业及二等工业有投资特权。（三）日本放弃其在拉丁美洲之财产并转移于美国。而美国则允在和会中支持日本之下列建议：（一）保持日本现有之工业设备，并可随后加以扩张。（二）准许输入日本工业所需要之原料。（三）废弃对日本工业及其对外贸易之任何限制。（四）免除自日本在中立国之国外资产及现行工业生产中缴纳赔偿。（五）日本有权向中国延期缴纳商品。（六）免除日本对日占区盟国资产之赔偿及其对此等地区占领费之偿还。在麦克阿瑟总部建议之下，日本已提出其和约对案（即指前述秘密备忘录），以观盟国之反应。除此以外，日政府并曾向麦克阿瑟总部提出关于军队、工业、战争潜力、商船及部分海军之其他建议。美国业已批准上述附加建议。
    　　　　用拖延和约来实现长期占领的阴谋
    在对日和约问题上，美国破坏了由美苏中英四国外长会议首先讨论和约的规定。去年七月十一日，美国未经中英苏三强同意，擅自向远东其他十国发出照会，邀请他们参加对日和约的预备会，擅自主张以三分之二多数表决通过的办法，取消四强一致同意的原则。美国坚持这种无理的主张，其目的是“故意阻挠举行和会”，以便“单独处理日本，待其一切计划完成后，再召集和会，那时美国便可就日本之情形作为既成事实而提出了”。　　　　　　　（合众社华盛顿五月二十三日电）
    据合众社华盛顿五月三十日电，美副国务卿罗维特曾告英外务部掌理远东事务之助理次官丹宁称：“美国不拟采取主动以求打开中苏及不列颠联合国之间对于召开日本和会程序问题所造成之僵局。”美国拒绝发动打开对日和会之僵局，使英国颇感惶惑。丹氏与罗维特及其他人士会谈，迄今认为在可见及之未来时期内，对日和会殊少召开之可能。
    六月十四日中央社转播华盛顿合众社消息，谓“此间官方对期望订立对日和约所怀之信念已发生转变，此问题已告置诸高阁”。
    即蒋党中央日报也于五月十四日泄露了美国拖延和约的目的。这天它刊载了题为“美国怎样扶植日本”的一篇文章，这篇文章是根据美国“新闻周刊”和“世界报告周刊”的材料移译而成的，该文译者列举了美国扶植日本的各种事实之后，在“拖的局面极有利于日本”的小标题下写道：“对日和会的召开仍遥遥无期。美国并不急于签订对日和约，放弃他现在日本行使的权力。相反地，她希维持目前的非正式和平状态，以便‘改造’日本成为她在多事的亚洲的可靠友邦”。
    今年一月二十一日新华社就揭露过美国企图长期占领日本的阴谋，新华社报导说：
    上海讯：去年十一月间，麦克阿瑟总部与日本政府官员曾先后宣布一项“惊人消息”，说日本存在着一个“秘密政府”，而美国占领军及其所谓“对日改革方案”则正受着这个所谓“秘密政府”的“广泛地下运动”的“严重威胁”。麦克阿瑟这个把戏的真实企图，乃是故意制造混乱的形势与紧张的空气，借以证明美国帝国主义者必须无限期地占领日本，此点现已为上海评论界人士所揭破。按所谓日本“秘密政府”的消息，系于去年十一月由麦克阿瑟总部正式报导，美国军政府副长官卡道上校于声明中宣称：目前的基本政治斗争是进行在“法律至上与匪徒的秘密统治之间，后者正利用过去的外交官、议会议员及工业家等各阵营人物”。同时，日本首相片山的亲信们则解释称：这些地下潜伏分子乃是过去的陆海军官，他们不愿接受战败，所以组织地下政府。日本政府发言人解释这个事实是“战争之后未恢复经济稳定前所有的自然产物”，为了抵抗这个情势，“若干日本领袖甚至主张签订和约后，美国占领军也不能撤退”。
    上海评论界人士认为此一被路透社驻东京记者当时描写为“最为片山首相接近的”日本发言人的谈话，实已将美日两国反动派的阴谋和盘托出。该人士指出：美国帝国主义者的全部阴谋就是长期占领日本作为侵略东方各民族的基地，这个阴谋不仅表现于所谓日本“秘密政府”的宣传，并且表现于麦克阿瑟故意制造日本国内政治经济危机的全部政策。而所谓与秘密政府有关并被指为受匪徒利用的日本陆海军官，前外交官，议会议员，工业家等，并不是被任何旁的匪徒所利用，恰恰就是被麦克阿瑟这个头号匪徒所利用。麦克阿瑟不但放纵并且积极利用这批战犯，使他们与他的另一批走狗片山等人扮演互相混战的傀儡戏，以便美国在混乱之中尽量延长占领期，这早已不是秘密了。
    该人士进一步指出：麦克阿瑟的这个策略，与外传麦氏对马歇尔的建议是相符合的。麦氏建议必须延长占领日本的时间，为此，并须在各种借口下拖延签订对日和约。麦氏认为美国在日本、中国和朝鲜必须保有美国军队与美国海空军基地，甚至即在签订对日和约以后仍应保留美国的军事力量，这样才能完全巩固美国在远东的地位。麦氏又认为：为达此项目的，就必须继续加深日本政治经济情况的恶化，并加强宣传日本紧张形势，使舆论觉得美国长期占领日本是被迫的和正当的。上海评论界人士特别提醒中国人民注意：麦克阿瑟的这一阴谋现正积极展开，而美国政府关于对日和会故意借取消四强否决权与召开所谓十一国会议以代替四国会议的无理取闹行动，使对日和会无从开起，正与这一阴谋完全合拍。美国关于拖延对日和会的政策，显然与其占领日本的政策服务于同一目的，即无限期占领日本以侵略东方各民族。
