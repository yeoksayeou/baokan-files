Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: Over 3,760 Kuomintang non-combatants captured in the central Jiaoji campaign have been released after investigation. The released personnel expressed deep gratitude for the lenient policies of the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army. Among them, Su Shaokang, secretary of the Kuomintang mining area party branch, Guo Cuifu, member of the Kuomintang Zichuan County party branch, and 620 other Kuomintang members voluntarily surrendered their party membership cards and documents, declaring their withdrawal from the Jiang party organization. Su, Guo, and five others jointly issued a letter to the Kuomintang Zibo party members and cadres, calling on them to repent and start anew with the democratic government as soon as possible. After the release of 69 Kuomintang League and puppet organization personnel from the Xihe Coal Mine, 115 Kuomintang members and puppet organization personnel in the mine voluntarily registered with the democratic government and concentrated on production. Influenced by our lenient policy, 255 township-level puppet organization personnel who had fled from Xihe and Boshan Chengguan returned home one after another to request repentance and a new start from the government. The democratic government welcomed their willingness to turn over a new leaf and concentrate on production.
