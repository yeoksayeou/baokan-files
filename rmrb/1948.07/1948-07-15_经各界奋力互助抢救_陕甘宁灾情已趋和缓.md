Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th. The severe famine in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, caused by the devastation and destruction of the Jiang-Hu bandit troops and affecting hundreds of thousands of people in fifteen counties, has gradually eased after more than eight months of arduous rescue and mutual assistance by the Party, government, army, and people of the entire region, from September of last year to May of this year, coupled with the summer harvest. Only in the Suide sub-region, in counties such as Mizhi, Jiaxian, Zhenchuan, and Hengshan, and in some areas of other sub-regions, are approximately 30,000 people still not completely free from the disaster because summer fields were not planted or were planted sparsely. Party and government organs are providing emergency relief.

As early as September of last year, when the Hu bandits began to collapse from the northern line after suffering heavy losses, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC and the Border Region Government established the Border Region Production and Disaster Relief Committee to uniformly lead the entire region's production and disaster relief work, implement the policy of combining production with disaster relief, prioritize disaster relief, and adopt various measures to vigorously rescue the situation. Chairman Lin Boqu, Secretary Xi Zhongxun, and others also personally went to the Suide sub-region, which was the most severely affected by the disaster, to conduct specific inspections and provide assistance. At the same time, a large amount of grain was transported from Taiyue and Longdong to provide relief. A summary of the production and disaster relief work over the past eight months is as follows:

First, mobilize the masses for self-rescue and mutual assistance, reward the masses with interest-free or low-interest loans, organize adjustments between neighboring districts and townships, launch relief fundraising, and correctly utilize the fruits of struggle. The above methods have adjusted a total of 23,000 *shi* of grain. At the same time, the government allocated more than 18,000 *shi* of grain and mobilized disaster victims and people in non-disaster areas to transport it for emergency relief.

Second, vigorously organize and lead the masses in production, combining production with disaster relief. The following measures were adopted in agriculture: the government issued agricultural loans of 4 billion agricultural currency, and adjusted 2,900 *shi* of seeds; public and private sectors adjusted more than 13,000 pieces of agricultural implements; a large number of women, children, and other semi-labor forces were organized to participate in production; 500,000 *mu* of land left behind by migrants were quickly planted; and some small-scale water conservancy projects were built. In total, the region (excluding the Huanglong sub-region) planted 4.5 million *mu* of summer fields this year, which can yield 650,000 to 700,000 *shi* of grain (300 *jin* per *shi*), and 10.4 million *mu* of autumn fields. If there are no unexpected disasters, the harvest can reach the level of normal years. A total of 1.5 million *mu* of uncultivated wasteland, mostly in remote and poor areas, accounts for about 12% of the total cultivated area before the war; this is a significant reduction compared to the 3.65 million *mu* of wasteland last year.

In terms of sideline production: the democratic government sent more than 100 cadres to the countryside to organize and lead, and invested 2.8 billion agricultural currency and loaned 100,000 *jin* of cotton. Together with the military shoe cotton issued by the Border Region Finance Department and the cotton purchased by the masses themselves, the total amount of cotton invested in rural textile production was about 1 million *jin*, which can produce about 320,000 *pi* of cloth. Folk weaving industry can recover to 50% to 60% of the pre-war level. In addition, the masses were mobilized to boil saltpeter (now 40,000 *jin* of saltpeter have been collected), organize the transportation of grain, and support the production of salt, charcoal, and porcelain. The income from the above-mentioned sideline production is estimated to be equivalent to moving 41,000 people to reclaim wasteland in non-disaster areas and the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, and mobilizing local people to help resettle the refugees and adjust accommodation. The Longdong sub-region government alone allocated 240 million agricultural currency and 500 *shi* of grain to solve the problem of agricultural tools, seeds, and food for the immigrants.

In this disaster relief campaign, the most important lesson is that: in some areas, due to the failure to earnestly implement the policy of mobilizing the masses to adjust mutually and organizing production for self-rescue, as well as the existence of bureaucratic style in organization and leadership, the masses in some areas (such as the Suide sub-region) suffered some losses that could have been avoided or mitigated. Conversely, in areas where the policy of production for self-rescue was better implemented and concrete leadership was carried out (such as An塞, Qing润, and the four townships of Xiangshi District in Jiaxian County), the famine was overcome or mitigated earlier. The bureaucratic style in disaster relief was first manifested in the lack of sufficient understanding of the disaster situation below, or the failure to attach importance to it in a timely manner; they neither reported it to the higher levels nor actively tried to solve it. Second, there was a lack of concrete organization and inspection, especially in the early stage of transporting relief grain. Many counties and districts did not mobilize well in advance, and there were no cadres to lead, resulting in loose organization and slow work. Third, there was simple relief with average distribution. For example, in the seventh township of the Fen德 forty-li-pu district, the first time relief grain was distributed, it was not based on the specific situation of each disaster-stricken family, but uniformly one *sheng* per person. In the second township of Yanchuan Yongping District, the first time relief grain was distributed, it was used effectively for production, creating a situation where they were helpless after the relief grain was used up. Conversely, the four townships of Xiangshi District in Jiaxian County adopted democratic appraisal in coordination with production, giving preferential treatment to those who actively labored to reclaim wasteland, resulting in very little wasteland, no starvation deaths, and becoming a model for production and disaster relief.

### 经各界奋力互助抢救  陕甘宁灾情已趋和缓

　　经各界奋力互助抢救
    陕甘宁灾情已趋和缓
    【新华社西北十二日电】陕甘宁边区遭蒋胡匪军蹂躏破坏，蔓延十五县数十万人口的严重灾荒，经全区党政军民自去年九月至今年五月八个多月的奋力抢救互助，接上夏收，现灾情已趋和缓，仅绥德分区之米脂、葭县、镇川、横山等县及其他分区一部分地区，因夏田未种或种得少，尚有三万人左右未完全免除灾害。党政机关正作紧急救济。
    早在去年九月当胡匪受创开始由北线溃退时，中共西北局、边区政府即成立边区生产救灾委员会，统一领导全区生产救灾工作，贯彻生产结合救灾方针，将救灾列为首要工作，采取多种办法，大力抢救。林伯渠主席、习仲勋书记等亦先后亲赴灾荒最重的绥德分区具体检查帮助，同时并由太岳及陇东赶运大批粮食救济。兹将八个多月生产救灾工作综述如下：
    首先发动群众自救互济，奖励群众以无利或低利借贷，组织邻近区乡间的调剂，发动救济募捐，并正确利用斗争果实。上述各面办法共调剂粮食二万三千石。同时，由政府拨粮一万八千余石，发动灾民及非灾区人民运输救急。
    其次，大力组织领导群众生产，使生产与救灾结合。农业方面采取了下列办法：政府曾发放农贷四十亿农币，调剂子种二千九百余石；公私调剂农具一万三千余件；大量组织妇女儿童等半劳力参加生产；抢种移民留下的土地五十万亩；并兴修了部分小型水利。总计全区（黄龙分区除外）今年共种夏田四百五十万亩，可收粮六十五至七十万石（每石三百斤），种秋田一千零四十万亩，如无意外灾害可达平年收成。未种熟荒共一百五十万亩，多属远地、坏地，约占战前全部耕地面积的百分之十二；较去年荒芜三百六十五万亩，已大见减少。
    副业生产方面：民主政府曾派出百余名干部下乡进行组织领导，并投资农币二十八亿元，贷棉花十万斤。连同边府财政厅所发军鞋花及群众自购花等，投入农村纺织生产的棉花共约有百万斤，约可产布三十二万疋。民间编织业可恢复到战前水平的百分之五十到六十。此外并发动群众熬硝（现已收硝四万斤），组织贩运粮食，扶助盐、炭、瓷业生产等。上述副业生产收入估计折员四万一千人移垦非灾区及晋绥解放区，发动当地人民帮助移来难民调剂住宿，政府亦拨放粮款协助。仅陇东分区政府即拨农币二亿四千万元，粮食五百石作解决移民农具子种口粮之用。
    在这次救灾运动中，最主要的教训是：部分地区由于未认真执行发动群众互相调剂，组织生产自救的方针，以及组织领导上官僚主义作风的存在，使某些地区（如绥德分区）群众遭受了某些本可避免或可减轻的损失。反之，执行生产自救方针较好，又进行了具体领导的地区（如安塞、清润及葭县响石区四乡），灾荒即能及早克服或减轻。救灾中的官僚主义作风，首先表现在对下面受灾情况不十分了解，或者未能及时重视；既不向上反映，又不积极设法解放。其次是缺乏具体组织检查，特别表现在初期运救济粮工作上，许多县区事先未很好动员，又无干部领导，致组织松懈，工作迟缓。再次是单纯救济平均发放，如纷德四十里铺区第七乡第一次发救济粮时不按灾民各家具体情况，而一律平均每人一升。延川永坪区二乡第一次发救济粮食有效的用于生产，形成救济粮发完便束手无策的现象。反之，葭县响石区四乡采取民主评议配合生产，从优照顾了积极劳动抢种荒地者，结果荒地很少，也未饿死人，并成为生产救灾模范。
