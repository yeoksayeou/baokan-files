　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. TASS, Prague, 21st: The Washington correspondent of the Telegraf Agency reports: Senator Styles Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that Congress has dispatched three "agents" to Europe to gather information on how Marshall Plan funds have been used in the first nine months. Bridges suggested to Congress on March 27th that it rebuild the wartime intelligence organization (i.e., the Office of Strategic Services, the supreme body directing American espionage activities in various countries) to counter the growing strength of the Communist Party. According to the conservative "U.S. News & World Report" weekly, the "Bridge Plan" was actually instigated by Dulles, and it stipulates engaging in espionage, sabotage, supporting all kinds of anti-communist elements, and "assassinating the lives of communist leaders." The Telegraf Agency stated that when discussing the ways and means of financing this secret war against people's democracy and the labor movement, Dulles suggested sacrificing the European "recovery program" to obtain funds for implementing this "plan." According to the Telegraf Agency, the "agents" mentioned by Bridges are ordered to precisely investigate this aspect of the European "recovery program."

  　订出万恶“布盟奇计划”
  　从事间谍罪行支持反共分子并谋刺各国共产党领袖生命
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社布拉格二十一日讯：电报通讯社华盛顿访员报导：美参院拨款委员会主席布里奇，宣布国会已派遣三名“代理人”至欧洲，搜集关于在头九个月中如何使用马歇尔计划款项的情报。布里奇曾于三月二十七日建议国会重建战时情报组织（即战略服务处，为指挥美国在各国作间谍活动的最高机关）以反对共产党日益增涨之力量。据保守的“美国新闻”与“世界报导”周刊称：“布里奇计划”实际上系杜勒斯策动的，其中规定从事间谍工作，破坏活动，支持各种各样的反共分子，以及“谋刺共产党领袖的生命”。电报通讯社称：当讨论这一资助反对人民民主与劳工运动秘密战争的方式与方法时，杜勒斯曾建议以牺牲欧洲“复兴计划”，来获得推行此一“计划”之经费。据电报通讯社称：布里奇所说的“代理人”即奉命精确地调查欧洲“复兴计划”的这一方面。
