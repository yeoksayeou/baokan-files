[Taihang News] Xiaoxi Village, Fourth District, Neiqiu, reviewed and summarized its agricultural and sideline production for the first half of the year in late June. Based on voluntary organization, the village has completed wheat harvesting, sowing, and weeding according to plan. The original plan was to cultivate 74 mu of wasteland, but the result was 98.7 mu. The number of livestock increased by 47 compared to last winter. Transportation, herb digging, weaving, silkworm rearing, and firewood gathering earned a total of more than 450,000 yuan (Jibi currency, same below). According to the villagers' research, the reasons why the villagers actively cultivate and develop production are, in addition to continuously carrying out policy propaganda and stabilizing the production mood of all strata, mainly: First, problems in mutual aid for labor can be solved in a timely manner. The village formed a unified large work team under truly democratic and voluntary combination, divided into two teams and six groups, under the unified leadership of the village's production committee (whether this unified large work team can fully guarantee the principle of equal value and voluntariness is questionable. And recent experiences in various places have proven that this kind of large-scale mutual aid is rarely successful, and the masses greatly welcome small-scale mutual aid - editor). Labor hero An Jiuren and other village cadres participated in each group to provide specific leadership and assistance. A major dispute once occurred in the Anquanlai group, and someone left the group, threatening the collapse of mutual aid. Comrade An Jiuren immediately went to the group to talk to the members, and also convened a group meeting to review the situation face to face, and found that the main reason for the dispute was Anquanlai's own mistakes: An Zhendong and other three group members were originally qualified for seven points of labor, but they were given five points. The whole group used the same water, and others only watered three times, while Quanlai watered seven times. When watering the families of soldiers, he went to water his own after only a short while. The group members raised their opinions to him face to face, but he did not accept them. Jiuren did not directly criticize Quanlai at the time, but first reviewed his own lack of help to the Quanlai group, which led to Quanlai's problems. Under Jiuren's influence, Quanlai also apologized to the group members face to face. After everyone's discussion, An Zhendong and others were all raised to seven points. An Shengyuan and other two people who had withdrawn from the group due to dissatisfaction saw that the problems were solved and returned to the group. Another time, in the Lao Zhang group, because the education committee member Li Kuixiao was originally seven points of labor, but he insisted on raising it to eight points, which caused many opinions among the group members. After timely review and correction, people's emotions were revitalized. Second, labor is used appropriately, and accounts are cleared in a timely manner. When encountering tasks such as sowing, reclaiming wasteland, harvesting wheat, and weeding, labor is uniformly and centrally used; after the task is completed, it is immediately dispersed into group activities, and the whole village uses unified work tickets. When going to the field to work, the group members carry their work tickets with them. After the work is completed, they democratically evaluate each person's labor and skills, the speed and quality of the work, and clear the work tickets on the spot. Once a task (such as sowing) is completed, the accounts are settled immediately, wages are paid to long-term workers, and debts are settled without delay. Everyone is very satisfied. Third, life is well arranged, and labor and time can be squeezed out to engage in sideline occupations. After completing the sowing with a drill in the spring, they immediately turned to accumulating fertilizer, threshing, and weeding wheat. After calculating, each group had spare labor. An Jiuren suggested that each laborer cultivate one mu of wasteland to subsidize the annual burden; nine people were drawn to Shanxi to dig herbs, and five people went to Zhao County to sell used clothes. Everyone agreed and did so, earning 48,000 yuan from herb digging, exceeding the wasteland reclamation plan; although selling used clothes did not make money, it helped the masses to change seasons. Later, when the spring seedlings should be weeded, they immediately concentrated their efforts on weeding. After a thorough rain, they quickly organized replanting. Every season, they ensure that labor is not wasted and agricultural work is not delayed. Fourth, the village's various organizations can play their due role. When the middle peasants were panicked and uneasy due to misunderstanding the Land Law, the Culture and Education Committee used civil schools, mutual aid groups, and weaving groups to organize discussions everywhere on the policies towards the middle peasants stipulated by Chairman Mao, which played a significant role. During a certain period, several "sharp heads" (people who like to take advantage) in the village deliberately found fault and engaged in extreme democracy. They resisted things that the masses should do. The Culture and Education Committee organized everyone to discuss what democracy is and whether democracy should not have centralized leadership. The peasants all said, "In the past ten years of the War of Resistance, nothing bad has ever happened in our village; if we mess around like this (referring to extreme democracy), I don't know what will happen!" The "sharp heads" were criticized by everyone and dared not make trouble. There was a time when there was no cotton, and the spinning wheels were idle; at another time, women had disputes due to the uneven quality of the yarn and cloth they handed in, and the mediation committee was responsible for resolving them well. Some women did not know how to repair spinning wheels and looms, and the thread broke while weaving, and the four experts from the technical guidance group went to the various groups to help, solving the difficulties and promoting weaving.
    The summary also criticized some shortcomings in the work in the past six months, such as not praising some good examples, not checking and urging enough after assigning work to some groups, and not actively educating and improving the unenthusiastic members of some groups, only saying that they were backward.... It was decided that these would be worked hard to overcome in future production.

　　健全领导适当安排生活勤算工帐随时解决问题
    小西村总结半年生产经验
    【太行讯】内邱四区小西村在六月下旬检讨总结前半年农副业生产。该村在自愿组织起来的基础上，麦收、下种与锄苗等都已按计划完成。原计划开荒七十四亩，结果开了九十八亩七。牲口较去冬增加四十七头。运输、刨药、纺织、养蚕、打柴等共赚洋四十五万余元（冀钞，下同）。该村农民积极耕作、发展生产的原因，据大家研究，除不断进行政策宣传、稳定各阶层生产情绪外；主要是：第一、拨工互助中有问题能及时解决。该村在真正民主自愿结合下，全村组成一个统一的大拨工队，下分两个中队，六个小组，由村的生产委员会统一领导（全村组织一个统一的大拨工队，其中能否完全保证等价自愿的原则？运用起来是否方便？均可怀疑。而最近各地经验均在证明这种大型互助搞好的很少，群众则十分欢迎小型互助——编者）。劳动英雄安九仁及其他村干分头参加各组，具体领导帮助。安全来组有一次发生大纠纷，有人退了组，互助眼看要垮台，安九仁同志马上跑到组里找组员们谈话，又召集组员会当面检讨，发现纠纷的主要原因是安全来自己有错误：安振德等三个组员本来够上七分劳力，却给人家评成五分。全组伙用一道水，别人才浇了三水，全来就浇了七水。给军属浇水时，浇了不多一会，他就又去浇自己的了。组员们当面给他提出意见，他不接受。九仁当时没有直接批评全来，先检讨自己对全来组帮助不够，以致全来发生了毛病。全来在九仁影响下，也当面向组员认了错。经过大家讨论，把安振德等都提到七分。因不满而退了组的安生元等二人，看见问题都解决了，又重新回到组里。又一次，老张组因为教育委员李奎小本来是七分劳力，他自己硬要提到八分，组员们发生了许多意见。经过及时检讨改正，人们的情绪又重新活跃起来。第二，使用劳力适当，清帐及时。遇到下种、开荒、麦收、锄苗等任务，就统一集中使用劳力；完成任务后，马上分散为小组活动，全村使用统一工票。去地做活时，组员都随身带着工票，做完了即民主评议各人的劳力、技术，做的快慢好坏，当场开清工票。一次任务（如下种）完成，马上算帐，长工的使工资，欠工的出工资，毫不拖拉。大家都很满意。第三，生活安排的好，能挤出劳力与时间搞副业。春季完成耧地下种，马上转向积肥、打＠、锄麦。各组计算了一下，都剩出了劳力。安九仁便提议每个劳力开生荒一亩，补助全年负担；抽九人到山西刨药，五人到赵县贩估衣。大家同意，照着做了，刨药赚洋四万八，开荒超过计划；估衣虽未赚钱，却帮助了群众换季。以后春苗该锄了，立刻集中力量锄苗。下了透雨，很快又组织了补种。每个季节都做到不浪费劳力，不耽误农活。第四，村里各个组织能发挥自己应有的作用。文教委员会当着中农因不了解土地法而恐慌不安时，就利用民校、互助组、纺织组到处组织讨论毛主席所规定的对中农的政策，起了不小作用。有个时期村里几个“尖头”（好占便宜的人）故意挑毛病，搞极端民主，应该群众做的事他偏抵抗，文教委员会就组织大家讨论什么是民主，民主是否不要集中的领导。农民们都说：“抗战十来年了，咱村什么事也没闹坏过；要这样乱捣蛋（指极端民主），不知道要闹成什么样哩！”“尖头”受到大家批评，不敢闹了。有一时期没了棉花，纺车都闲起来了；又一时期妇女们因交的线和布好坏不等闹纠纷，调解委员会都负责很好的解决了。有的妇女不会修理纺车和织机，织布断了线没办法，技术指导组的四个能手便分头到各组帮助，解决了困难，推进了纺织。
    总结时也批判了半年来工作上一些缺点，如有些好的榜样没有表扬，有的组布置工作后检查督促不够，有的组对不积极的组员没主动教育提高，光说人家落后……。这些都决定在今后生产中努力克服。
