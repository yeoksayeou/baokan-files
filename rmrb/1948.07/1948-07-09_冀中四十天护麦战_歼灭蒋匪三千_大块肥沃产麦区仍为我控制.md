[Central Hebei, 3rd dispatch] Branch reporter reports: In the recent forty days (from late May to late June), our Central Hebei Local Corps and local armed forces, combined with the militia, launched a widespread and fierce wheat protection campaign in the Pingjinbao (Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding) triangle area, annihilating more than 3,000 bandits and completely smashing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' conspiracy to loot wheat. Currently, towns like Rongcheng, Baxian, Xiongxian Zangang, Banjiawo north of the Daqing River, and the vast rural areas, including large fertile wheat-producing areas, are still under our control. The enemy is compressed into a few isolated strongholds such as Baoding and Xincheng. From late May to early June, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Pingjinbao held military conferences one after another, plotting to loot wheat extensively in the liberated areas. The 32nd Provisional Division of the New 2nd Army of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Baoding, and some local bandits, constantly harassed our border areas of Anxin and Qingyuan, attempting to establish wheat-looting strongholds on the periphery of Baoding. Wang Fenggang's 15th and 16th Regiments north of the Daqing River also continuously harassed and looted grain. In order to thwart the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' conspiracy to loot wheat, our Central Hebei local armed forces and militia actively launched attacks. Our troops on the periphery of Baoding first ambushed Gao Zhuodong, the commander of the New Second Army of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, near Baitapu, Xushui, on May 20, annihilating 86 bandits. Gao was seriously injured in the head and fled back to Beiping in a panic. On the 22nd, our army again repelled four regiments of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who invaded from Xu (Shui) and Bao (Ding) in the Shili Pu and Nanchang Fort area between Bao and Xu, annihilating more than 300 bandits. On June 9, the local armed forces and militia on the periphery of Baoding, in Huangtuo, more than ten miles away from Baoding, attacked three strongholds of Weijiaying and Dongcaocun southwest of Xincheng on the east side of Pinghan, and all the defending enemies were wiped out. On the same day, in Xiaofu Village, Dafu Village, and other places, fierce village tunnel warfare was launched with the bandits, defeating the attacks of three regiments of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 31st Provisional Division and annihilating more than 130 bandits. On the 16th, our army in northern Baoding ambushed five battalions of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were dispatched from Baoding to loot wheat at Caohe, annihilating 250 bandits. Under the continuous attacks of our army and people, the Chiang Kai-shek army's 32nd Provisional Division was compressed into Baoding City, and the grain looting plan was declared bankrupt. On the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and north of the Daqing River, a part of our local armed forces and militia captured Shengfang City, an important commercial town in western Tianjin, on May 31, and took advantage of the victory to advance to the east and north of Shengfang, sweeping away bandit strongholds such as Fuguan Camp and Anlitun between Shengfang and Duliu, and once captured Yangfen Port, an important stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits ten miles northwest of Tianjin, annihilating more than 130 people, including Gao Zezhou, the puppet Wenan County magistrate. After suffering this blow, the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs hurriedly transferred their 22nd Division and 157th Division to reinforce western Tianjin. They attacked Shengfang on the 6th. After annihilating more than 70 enemies, our army took the initiative to withdraw from the city in order to carry out wheat protection operations in a mobile manner (it is noted that the city was recaptured by us on July 1). Starting from September, a part of our army, taking advantage of the bandits' unstable foothold, cooperated with our Bohai Army to launch an offensive on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, destroying nine bandit strongholds, 20 bunkers along the coast of Beicheng River east of Tangguantun and the section from Jinghai to Tangguantun, and destroying 20 miles of electric wires. On the 12th, more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the 155th Division who occupied Shengfang went to Tongzhuangzi, Nandai, and other places north of Shengfang to loot wheat. Our local militia rose up to resist and launched village warfare with the bandits, annihilating 81 bandits. A certain village militia fought fiercely with Chiang Kai-shek bandits who outnumbered them 21 to 1 for a whole day. The bandits used rocket launchers to cover three assaults, but they were all repelled by the militia's "sniper" tactics. Also, when the bandits attacked a certain village, they fired more than a hundred shells and charged the militia three times, but were still bravely repelled by the militia with hand grenades. At the same time, the local armed forces and militia in Anci, Yongqing, Xiongxian, Baxian and other places also continued to inflict severe blows on the enemy with small annihilation battles. On the 21st, Wang Bandit's 1st Brigade went south of Zangang to loot wheat and was surrounded by us, annihilating more than 290 bandits.
    In total, from late May to the end of June, in forty days, a total of 3,061 officers and soldiers, including Gao Zhuodong (injured), commander of the New Second Army of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, Gao Zezhou (killed), Wenan County magistrate, and Guo Ruixiang (killed), deputy battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 20th Regiment of the Bao were killed, wounded, or captured. One curved-shooting gun, 73 60mm mortars, 41 light and heavy machine guns, 5 submachine guns, 668 long and short guns, more than 49,000 rounds of ammunition, 3 trucks, and many other items were seized. The results of these forty days exceeded the total of four and a half months from January to mid-May this year (2,843 bandits were killed, wounded, or captured). This fully demonstrates that after the new-style military reorganization movement, the morale of our army in central Hebei has been raised a hundredfold, and the combat effectiveness has been greatly improved. The Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit army, under our severe blows, is increasingly demoralized, fleeing one after another, or defecting with their weapons. In the month of May alone, our 10th Military Sub-district accommodated 1,015 Chiang Kai-shek army members who surrendered. More than 100 people fled from the 6th Security Brigade of the Jinghai puppet regime in half a month.

　　冀中四十天护麦战
    歼灭蒋匪三千
    大块肥沃产麦区仍为我控制
    【冀中三日电】分社记者报导：最近四十天（五月下旬到六月底）我冀中地方兵团、地方武装结合民兵，在平、津、保三角地区普遍展开激烈的护麦战，歼匪三千余名，将匪抢麦阴谋全部粉碎。现大清河北容城、霸县、雄县昝岗、板家窝等城镇，及广大农村，包括大块肥沃之产麦区，仍在我控制中，敌人则被压缩于保定、新城等少数孤立据点内。五月下旬到六月初，平、津、保各地蒋匪，先后召开了军事会议，阴谋向解放区大肆抢麦。保定蒋匪新二军暂卅二师及土蒋一部，不时进扰我安新、清苑等边缘区，妄图在保定外围建立抢麦据点。大清河北王匪凤岗部十五、十六两团，也不断出扰抢粮。我冀中地武民兵，为粉碎蒋匪抢麦阴谋，纷纷主动出击。保定外围我军，首于五月二十日，在徐水白塔铺附近伏击蒋匪新二军军长高卓东，歼匪八十六名，高匪头部重伤，狼狈窜回北平。廿二日，我军又在保（定）徐（水）间之十里铺、南常堡一带，击退由徐、保出犯之蒋匪四个团并歼匪三百余。六月九保定外围我地武民兵，有距保定十余里之黄陀日晚，我军一部奔袭平汉东侧新城西南之魏家营、东曹村等三据点，守敌全部就歼。同日，小福村、大福村等地，与匪展开激烈的村落地道战，打垮蒋匪暂三十一师三个团的进攻，歼匪一百三十余名。十六日，保北我军在漕河伏击由保定出动抢麦的蒋匪五个营，歼匪二百五十名。在我军民连续打击下，蒋军暂卅二师即被压缩至保定市内，抢粮计划宣告破产。在津浦北段及大清河北，我地武民兵一部，于五月三十一日，一举攻克津西商业重镇胜芳市，并乘胜向胜芳以东以北地区推进，将胜芳、独流间之富官营、安里屯等匪据点一扫而光，并一度攻克天津西北十里之蒋匪重要据点杨汾港，歼伪文安县长高泽洲以下一百三十余。蒋傅匪帮遭此打击，慌忙抽调其二十二师、一五七师两个师增援津西。于六日进攻胜芳，我军于歼敌七十余名后，为机动进行护麦战，主动撤离该市（按该市于七月一日再度为我克复）。九月起我军一部趁匪立脚未稳，又配合渤海我军，向津浦北段发动攻势，摧毁唐官屯以东、北城河沿岸及静海到唐官屯段匪据点九处，碉堡二十座，破坏电线二十里。十二日，侵占胜芳之蒋匪一五五师千余人，到胜芳以北之佟庄子、南堤等地抢麦，我当地民兵奋起阻击，与匪展开村落战，歼匪八十一名。某村民兵与二十一倍于己的蒋匪激战一整天，匪用火箭炮掩护冲锋三次，都被民兵用“冷枪”战术打退。又当匪军向某村进攻时，曾发炮百余发，向民兵冲锋三次，但仍被民兵用手榴弹英勇击退。与此同时，安次、永清、雄县、霸县等地地武民兵，也不断用小歼灭战给敌严重打击，二十一日，王匪保一旅到昝岗以南抢麦，被我包围，歼匪二百九十余名。
    总计五月下旬到六月底，四十天中，共毙伤俘匪新二军军长高卓东（伤）、文安县长高泽洲（毙）、保二十团三营副营长郭瑞祥（毙）以下官兵三千零六十一名。缴曲射炮一门，六○炮七三门，轻重机枪四一挺，冲锋枪五支，长短枪六六八支，子弹四万九千余发，卡车三辆，其他物品甚多。这四十天战绩，超过今年一月到五月中旬四个半月的总和（毙伤俘匪二八四三名）。充分说明冀中我军经过新式整军运动后，士气百倍昂扬，战斗力大大提高，而蒋傅匪军在我严重打击下，士气日益低落，纷纷逃亡，或携械投诚。在五月份一个月中，我十分区即收容投诚之蒋军一千零一十五人。静海伪保安第六大队，半月就逃亡一百多人。
