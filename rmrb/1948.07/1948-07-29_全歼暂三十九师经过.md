Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 26th: A front-line reporter reports on the complete annihilation of the fleeing enemy's 39th Provisional Division and other units in Xin County in this campaign: Just as our army's offensive spearhead was directly threatening the provincial capital of Taiyuan, the entire 39th Provisional Division of Yan's 43rd Army besieged in the isolated city of Xin County, the entire 16th Security Regiment, Yan's Third Special Commissioner's Office, and the puppet county governments of Xin County, Dingxiang, Guoxian, Jingle, and Wutai, the Kuomintang County Party Headquarters, police stations, revenge squads, civil defense forces, etc., all terrified by the power of our army, abandoned the city in a panic and fled south on the morning of the 20th. However, only twenty miles out of the city, they were met head-on by a certain unit of our local corps, which fiercely struck and captured over 3,000 enemy soldiers. Liu Pengxiang, the commander of the enemy's 39th Provisional Division, then led the remnants to cower and hold the Douluo Village, twenty miles south of Xin County, attempting to resist stubbornly and await reinforcements. However, the Yan army's 68th Division and other units stationed in the Huangtu Village area, only thirty miles south of Douluo Village, did not dare to come to their aid for the entire day. Our army then quickly surrounded and fiercely attacked the enemy, launching a general offensive at 21:00 on the 20th. The enemy quickly collapsed and was completely annihilated. The People's Liberation Army seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies. Detailed battle results are currently being tallied.

　　全歼暂三十九师经过
    【新华社晋中前线二十六日电】前线记者报导我军此次全歼忻县逃敌暂编三十九师等部的经过称：正当我军攻势矛头直逼太原省会之际，困守忻县孤城的阎匪四十三军暂三十九师全部、保安十六团全部，阎匪第三专员公署及忻县、定襄、崞县、静乐、五台等伪县政府，国民党县党部、警察局、复仇队、民卫军等全部，慑于我军声威，恐慌万状，于二十日晨仓惶弃城南逃。但出城刚二十里，即遭我地方兵团某部迎头痛击，当歼俘敌三千余人。敌暂三十九师师长刘鹏翔乃率残敌畏缩踞守忻县南二十里的豆罗村，企图顽抗待援，但驻守豆罗村以南仅三十里的黄土寨一带的阎军六十八师等部，在一整天时间内，始终不敢出援。我军乃迅速包围歼敌勇猛围歼，至二十日二十一时发起总攻，敌人迅即土崩瓦解，全军覆没。解放军缴获武器弹药及辎重物资甚多详细战果正清查中。
