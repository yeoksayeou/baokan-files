(Taihang News) Since the beginning of summer, the Taihang area has experienced a prolonged period without rain, and recently an insect plague has occurred, damaging autumn crops, especially along the Pinghan Railway. Currently, it has been discovered in 25 districts of eight counties, including Tangyin, Anyang, Ci County, Lin County, Zhangnan, She County, Shahe, and Neiqiu. The types of insect pests include mole crickets, locusts, darkling beetles, cutworms, grubs, wireworms, walnut weevils, underground worms, and dermestid beetles. Statistics from 76 villages in 16 districts of seven counties show that 22,000 mu of field crops have been damaged. The most severely affected area, Zhangnan, has suffered insect plagues in one-third of its villages. Mole crickets have been widely found in ten districts of Anyang. In seven districts and twenty villages alone, 4,834 mu of autumn seedlings have been destroyed. These pests were first discovered in various locations in early June, with mole crickets being the most numerous, followed by locusts and darkling beetles. In the densest areas, one could step on five or six with each footstep, and in less dense areas, there were a dozen or more with each step. After the insect plague occurred, the Fifth Administrative Office dispatched special personnel to the affected areas to assist local governments in leading the masses to eradicate the pests. It was also stipulated that each county should report the local insect plague situation and eradication efforts to the local Party committee and the administrative office daily. The Sixth Administrative Office designated the secretaries of the county governments to be responsible for grasping the situation, taking the initiative in leadership, and mobilizing forces in a timely manner to eradicate the pests based on the development of the situation. After mobilization meetings for insect eradication were held by county, district, and village cadres and the masses, insect eradication headquarters at the county, district, and joint defense levels were formed from top to bottom. Anyang has now launched a widespread mass insect eradication campaign. In the Seventh District, 103 out of 106 natural villages, with 5,679 people, have been involved in the movement within two days. Twenty-five villages have already eliminated 6,880 cartloads of mole crickets, and the entire district will be able to eliminate them all within three more days. In the five villages of Madian, Liuma, and others in the Eighth District of Lin County, which was the most severely affected by insect pests, mole crickets have been basically eliminated. In the four villages of Beiliang, Fengtang, and others in Ci County, 1,136 jin of darkling beetles were captured in one and a half days, saving 400 mu of autumn seedlings. According to statistics from 59 villages in Anyang, Lin County, and Neiqiu counties, 16,122 mu of autumn seedlings have been saved.
