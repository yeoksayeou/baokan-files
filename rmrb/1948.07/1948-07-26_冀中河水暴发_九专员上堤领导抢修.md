　　Jizhong River Water Bursts Forth
　　Nine Commissioners Ascend Dike to Lead Emergency Repairs

　　[Jizhong 23rd Dispatch] Recent continuous rainfall has caused rivers in Jizhong to swell dramatically. The Hutuo River's water level suddenly surged on the morning of the 21st, reaching depths of 13-14 feet. In the suburbs of Gaocheng, the river overflowed its south bank and flooded east of the river channel. The Sha River entered Luoluo Village in Anguo on the 21st, with the water level reaching 7.5 feet and a rapid current. The large iron bridge east of Nanguan in Xinle has breached, and fifteen villages have already been flooded. According to experienced river defense personnel, "This river outburst is surging with greater force than in 1939." Currently, all river flood control headquarters have gone to the dikes for inspection. At the breach in Xinle, Party, government, military, and civilians are actively leading the masses in emergency repairs. Commissioner Zhang of the Ninth Administrative Office has also personally gone to the Sha River dike to direct flood prevention work.

　　冀中河水暴发
  　九专员上堤领导抢修
    【冀中廿三日电】近日阴雨连绵，冀中各河河水暴涨。滹沱河水于二十一日晨突然猛涨，深处达一丈三、四尺，在藁城城郊，由南岸漫河漕东溢。沙河水于二十一日入安国流罗村，水头七尺五寸，水势甚急。新乐南关大铁桥东决口，十五个村已被水淹。据河防有经验人说：“此次河水暴发，水势汹涌，较民国二十八年为甚”。现各河防汛指挥部已上堤巡视；新乐决口处，党政军民正积极领导群众抢修；九专署张专员也亲往沙河堤指挥防汛工作。
