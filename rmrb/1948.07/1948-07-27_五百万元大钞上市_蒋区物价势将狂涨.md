Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st – According to various sources, Yu Hongjun, president of Chiang Kai-shek's Central Bank, announced on the 18th that four new denominations of large-value Gold Standard Notes would be issued from the 19th: namely 10,000 yuan, 25,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 250,000 yuan. The exchange rate between the Gold Standard Notes and the "Legal Tender" is 20 to 1, so Chiang Kai-shek's "Legal Tender" is equivalent to 200,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan, 1 million yuan, and 5 million yuan. The highest denomination of the new banknote (5 million yuan) is 50 times higher than the previous highest denomination of Chiang Kai-shek's currency (100,000 yuan). Previously, the Chiang government issued Gold Standard Notes in denominations of 1,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan, and 5,000 yuan on December 9th last year, equivalent to 20,000 yuan, 40,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's "Legal Tender." It is widely believed that the issuance of such huge banknotes will inevitably lead to a surge in prices. On the eve of the issuance of the large banknotes, Shanghai's financial and commodity prices had already begun to rise sharply. On the 17th alone, milk prices soared 4.8 times, gasoline rose by 40 percent, and hotel room rents increased by 60 percent. On the same day, the U.S. dollar exchange rate broke through the 7 million yuan mark, reaching 7.2 million yuan per U.S. dollar, an increase of 1.2 million yuan compared to the 10th; gold had risen to 350 million yuan per tael, an increase of 50 million yuan compared to the 9th; and rice, after a brief decline, has now rebounded to 35 million yuan per dan. On the same day (the 18th) that the Chiang government announced the issuance of new denomination banknotes, Chiang Kai-shek's Central and China Airlines announced a 150 percent increase in airfares, marking the second fare increase since the 2nd of this month.
