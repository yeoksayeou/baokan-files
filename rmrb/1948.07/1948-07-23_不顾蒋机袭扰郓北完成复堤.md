(Jilu Yu Electric Dispatch) Yunbei County (newly established county, located in northern Yuncheng) completed the major dyke restoration task before the major flood season. To ensure that the Yellow River embankment would not break, the county mobilized 17,000 laborers on the 14th of last month to carry out the major dyke restoration. During the restoration, they were constantly bombed and strafed by American-aided Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft, but the morale of the laborers remained high, and they persisted in their work without slackening. On the 22nd, two enemy planes dropped dozens of bombs in places such as the Yihezhuang dyke section, Gaozhuang, and Xiaopikou, killing and wounding more than a hundred laborers. However, the projects in various locations were completed on schedule after ten days, completing a total of 243,974 cubic meters of earthwork. From the 7th of this month, the Yunbei dyke section again mobilized 12,000 laborers to continue work, with a plan to complete another 160,299 cubic meters of earthwork.

　　不顾蒋机袭扰郓北完成复堤
    【冀鲁豫电】郓北县（新设县，位于郓城北部）于大汛期前完成大复堤任务。该县为确保临黄不使开口，于上月十四日，动员民工一万七千人进行大复堤。在复堤中，曾遭美援蒋机不断轰炸扫射，但民工情绪始终高涨，坚持工作不懈。二十二日敌机两架，在义和庄堤段乡、高庄、肖皮口等地投弹数十枚，死伤民工达百余人。但各地工程历时十天仍按期完成，共作二十四万三千九百七十四土方。郓北堤段由本月七日起，又动员民工一万二千人继续开工，计划再完成十六万零二百九十九土方的工程。
