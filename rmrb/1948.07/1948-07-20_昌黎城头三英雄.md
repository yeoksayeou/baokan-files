　　Three Heroes on the Walls of Changli
    Shi Bi
    During the battle to recapture Changli City by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, two of the three members of Li Yuji's combat team performed meritorious service, and one performed two meritorious services.
    At the West Gate, the enemy had two bunkers. One was destroyed, and the other was still intact. There were also three bunkers on the city tower, and rows of bunkers stretching from the city tower to the southwest corner. The enemy's firepower was intensely blockading the area, and the People's Liberation Army had to climb up the city walls from here to annihilate the enemy.
    When combat team leader Zhang Minghu was wounded, Li Yuji immediately took over his duties. Carrying six grenades and a rifle, he was the first to climb onto the city wall. Liu Yongfu followed Li Yuji, but as soon as he stepped onto the fourth rung of the ladder, it slipped down the city wall. The enemy concentrated their fire on Li Yuji, who used grenades to repel the enemy in the bunker on the right. He then took cover behind a low wall built by the enemy, using grenades to retaliate against a group of enemies rushing towards him.
    As Li Yuji threw his fifth grenade, Liu Yongfu also climbed onto the city wall. Huang Benrang was the third to ascend. When he was four or five feet away from the parapet, the ladder slipped again. He held a grenade in his left hand and grabbed the city wall with his right, thinking that he was about to get onto the wall and could not give up even if he died. He hung there for a quarter of an hour before the ladder was set up again and he could climb onto the wall. After Huang Benrang got onto the wall, the ladder slipped down and could not be erected again. Thus, only three soldiers made it onto the west wall of Changli. Grenades were exploding non-stop on the wall. Squad leader Li Zhihe looked at the ladder and then at the sloping outer moat, realizing that there was no way to rely on the ladder. Liu Yongfu picked up the grenades left by the retreating enemy and combined them with his own, totaling nine. Huang Benrang brought eleven more. They relied on these twenty grenades and three rifles to stubbornly repel the enemy's second fierce attack. At this time, the enemy realized the number of PLA soldiers on the wall and launched a third frenzied attack, with a group of enemies also flanking from the right, attempting to attack from both sides. The heroes calmly resisted, and when the enemy advanced into the ditch, a volley of grenades was thrown, and the enemy fell into the ditch and did not move. At this point, the heroes had only two grenades left, one of which was a dynamite grenade. After discussing it, they decided to keep it to use in the most critical moment.
    Half an hour later, a loud "boom" was heard from below the city. The heroes knew it was the sound of explosives, indicating that the city gate had been blown open and the main force was about to come up. Their fighting will became even stronger. Li Yuji fired twenty shots in one breath, blocking the enemy and preventing them from taking another step out of the bunker. They held the breakthrough point as firmly as nails.
    Soon, figures suddenly appeared on the wall to their left. The main force of the People's Liberation Army had climbed onto the city. (Jidong Frontline Telegram)

　　昌黎城头三英雄
    石碧
    解放军某部收复昌黎城战斗中，李玉基的战斗组三个人中两个人立了大功，一个人立了两个功。
    西城门口，敌人有两个地堡，一个被打垮了，一个还完好无损。城楼上另有三个地堡，从城楼至城西南角更是地堡成排。敌人的火力炽烈地封锁着，而解放军就要从这里爬上城去歼灭敌人。
    战斗组长张明虎挂了花，李玉基马上代替了他的职务，带着六颗手榴弹，一支步枪，第一个首先登上了城。刘永福继李玉基之后，刚踏上四凳梯阶，梯子就从城墙上滑了下来。敌人集中火力向李玉基射击，李用手榴弹击退了右边地堡里的敌人，跟着隐蔽在敌人筑好的一堵矮墙后面，用手榴弹还击着向他扑来的一股敌人。
    当李玉基打出第五个手榴弹的时候，刘永福也爬上了城。黄本让第三名登城。当他距垛口四、五尺远的时候，梯子又滑走了。他左手提着手榴弹，右手抓住城墙吊在那里，他想已经快上城了，死也不能下去。他在那里吊了一刻钟，梯子再架起时他才上了城。黄本让上城后，梯子滑下去再也竖不起来了。这样昌黎的西城就只上去了三个战士。城上的手榴弹在响个不停，班长李志和看看梯子又看看斜滑的外壕，实在没法靠梯子。刘永福拣起敌人溃退时留下的手榴弹和自己的凑了九个。黄本让又带来了十一个。他们就靠这二十个手榴弹、三条步枪，顽强的击退了敌人第二次猛烈的冲锋。这时敌人弄清了解放军登城的人数，疯狂的发动第三次冲锋，一股敌人并从右翼迂回过来，企图两面夹击。英雄们沉着抗击，待敌进至沟内，一排手榴弹飞了过去，敌人就倒在沟里不动弹了。这时英雄们的手榴弹仅剩下了两个，一个是炸药手榴弹，他们讨论了一下，决定留下它准备在最危急时使用。
    半个钟头以后，城下传来了“轰”的一声巨响，英雄们熟悉这是炸药声，知道城门被炸开了，主力就要上来，战斗意志越发强固了。李玉基一气打了二十发子弹，封锁着敌人，不让敌人再出地堡一步。他们象钉钉子一样坚不可拔的守住了突破口。
    不久，从他们左侧的墙上突然出现了人影。解放军的主力登城了。（冀东前线电）
