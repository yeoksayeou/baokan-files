	[Jilu豫 Urgent Telegram] After Chiang Kai-shek's army's 68th Division, 81st Brigade, 241st Regiment, occupied the Gao Village critical point, forcing our repair work to stop, they used our disaster relief bricks and materials to build碉堡 [diāobǎo, a fortified blockhouse or bunker] on the dam. When the 14th dam surface of the critical point was repaired by us to be two and a half meters above the water surface, it was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's army. Because of this, the bottom of the埽 [sào, a kind of dike or embankment made of sorghum stalks, reeds, etc.] was extremely unstable and could not withstand the scouring of the flood. By the morning of the 23rd, the bottom of the埽 [sào] was hollowed out by the water and collapsed into the water. If repairs are immediately grasped, it can still be salvaged; otherwise, the dam埽 [sào] that has collapsed into the water will be in danger of being washed away. If so, the inner埽 [sào] and dam foundation will be in danger. The nearby masses, seeing the danger of the埽 [sào], have repeatedly requested repairs, but have been prohibited by Chiang Kai-shek's army.
	[Jilu豫 Telegram] American-aided Chiang Kai-shek planes continue to bomb riverside villages, destroying and hindering the Yellow River control project. At 3:00 PM on the 9th of this month, three Chiang Kai-shek planes dropped twenty-five 500-pound bombs on the three villages of Dasangshu, Kangzhuang, and Shajiedui in the Fourth District of Puyang, destroying 61 houses, killing 4 people, and injuring 8 people. Our democratic government immediately distributed 1,560 catties of wheat to provide emergency relief to the victims.

　　高村埽底出险蒋匪破坏抢修
  　濮阳沿河村庄又遭轰炸
    【冀鲁豫急电】蒋匪军六八师八一旅二四一团，侵占高村险工，使我抢修工程被迫停工后，即用我抢险砖料，在坝上修筑碉堡。该险工十四坝坝面由我抢修高出水面二公尺半时，即被蒋匪军所侵占，因之，埽底极不巩固，抗不住洪流掏刷。迄二十三日上午，该埽埽底被水掏空，即坍塌入水，如果立即抓紧抢修，还可挽救，否则坍入水中的坝埽，即有被冲走的危险，如是则里头埽和坝基，均将出险。附近群众见该埽出险，纷纷要求抢修，均遭蒋匪军禁止。
    【冀鲁豫电】美援蒋机继续轰炸沿河村庄，破坏阻挠治黄工程。本月九日下午三时蒋机三架在濮阳四区大桑树、康庄、沙揭堆三村投掷五百磅炸弹二十五枚，炸毁房子六十一间，炸死四人，伤八人。我民主政府当即发放麦子一千五百六十斤，急救被难群众。
