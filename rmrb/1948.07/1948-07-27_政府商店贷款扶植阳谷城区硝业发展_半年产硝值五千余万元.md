[Ji Lu Yu Telegram] Yanggu County is a famous saltpeter production area, with over 20 years of saltpeter boiling history and many saltpeter producers with excellent skills. This spring, the government helped to develop saltpeter and sulfur production. The county bank issued loans of 275,000 yuan (冀钞, JiluYu currency, same below), and the Hua Feng Store also pre-borrowed 2.35 million yuan to solve the difficulties of saltpeter producers. The number of saltpeter households increased from 116 last November to 225. In November and December of last year, the output of saltpeter was 1,815 catties. In the first half of this year, the output was more than 56,000 catties. Calculated at an average of 1,000 yuan per catty, the value of saltpeter produced in the first half of this year can reach more than 56 million yuan. Xu Fujie of West Street produced 159 catties of saltpeter in one month, selling for more than 198,000 yuan, which could buy 3 shi, 9 dou, and 6 sheng of red grain. Therefore, poor people in Chengguan (county seat) did not encounter difficulties in their livelihoods this year. The government has established a Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau in the area to promote and further develop the saltpeter industry.
