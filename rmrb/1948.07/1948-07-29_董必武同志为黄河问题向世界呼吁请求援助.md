Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Comrade Dong Biwu, Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association, issued an urgent appeal to Mr. Hoskins, President of the American Friends Service Committee China Service Unit, and Mr. Jernudd, representative of the American Red Cross in China, regarding the Yellow River flood control problem. The original telegram is as follows:

Mr. Hoskins, President of the American Friends Service Committee China Service Unit, and to Mr. Jernudd of the American Red Cross: I am now representing the China Liberated Areas Relief Association to make an urgent appeal to you regarding the danger of breaches on the southern bank of the Yellow River due to the obstruction of the People's efforts to repair the dangerous sections of the Yellow River embankment by the Kuomintang army. Since the Yellow River returned to its old course last year, our liberated area governments and people have continued to repair the river堤 works, expending enormous manpower and material resources. Consequently, the embankment works on the northern bank have been largely completed. However, the section from Dongming to Juancheng, at the junction of Hebei and Shandong provinces, and the section near Jinan, on the southern bank of the Yellow River, have been repeatedly damaged and cannot be completed due to frequent incursions by the Kuomintang army. Now that the summer flood season has arrived, the Kuomintang army has again concentrated five divisions and thirteen brigades, lingering along the Dongming, Juancheng, and Yuncheng line, controlling the Yellow River embankment, and destroying the river works, making it impossible for the nearby residents to carry out any flood control work even with tens of thousands of people mobilized. The Kuomintang air force is also carrying out wanton acts of destruction, and recently, more than one hundred people have been injured or killed due to bombing and strafing, forcing the flood control work to be interrupted. Currently, the water level continues to rise, and the southern bank is on the verge of breaching. Once the embankment collapses and the water rushes out, not only will the people in several provinces of our liberated areas bear the brunt, but also the residents in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially the Kuomintang army now on the southern bank of the Yellow River, will hardly escape. You, gentlemen, and the organizations you represent, have always regarded disaster relief as your responsibility for issues concerning the lives and properties of millions of Chinese people, and I believe you must be concerned. Therefore, I specifically request you to convey our appeal to all international and Chinese relief and charitable organizations, requesting the Kuomintang army and air force to cease obstructing the local residents' flood control and embankment repair work, and requesting the Kuomintang water conservancy authorities and international relief organizations to provide the local residents with urgent technical and material assistance to facilitate the river works. If you, gentlemen, are willing to come to the liberated areas to discuss specific relief issues, we will sincerely welcome you. However, the water situation is becoming increasingly urgent, and we have no convenient means of communication with you, so we are specifically using radio broadcast to express our appeal and request, hoping that foreign news agencies can forward it to Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Jernudd after listening to this broadcast, in order to save the lives of millions of people. We will be extremely grateful.

　　董必武同志为黄河问题向世界呼吁请求援助
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】中国解放区救济总会主任委员董必武氏，为黄河抢险问题向世界公谊会中国服务会会长郝思金斯氏，及美国红十字会驻华代表朱诺德氏发出紧急呼吁，原电如下：
    世界公谊会中国服务会会长郝思金斯先生并转美国红十字会朱诺德先生：我现在代表中国解放区救济总会，为国民党军队阻挠人民抢修黄河险工致黄河南岸已有决口危险一事，特向你们提出紧急呼吁。黄河自去年归故以来，我解放区政府和人民即继续修复河堤工作，所费人力物力极大，因之北岸堤工大体完成。惟独黄河南岸河北、山东两省交界处之东明至鄄城一段，及济南附近一段，则因国民党军队常往侵挠，致修复工作迭遭破坏，无法完工。现夏泛已至，而国民党军队复集五个师十三个旅之众，徘徊于东明、鄄城、郓城之线，控制黄河堤，破坏河工，致使附近居民虽集中数万人力图抢险亦无从下手。国民党空军更从而肆虐，最近期内因遭轰炸扫射致伤亡者竟达一百余人，抢险工作遂被迫中断。目前水势继长，南岸已濒决口危险。一旦堤溃水奔，不但我解放区数省人民首当其冲，即国民党统治区居民，首先是现在黄河南岸之国民党军队亦难幸免。对于此等关系千百万中国人民生命财产问题，两先生及两先生所代表的团体，素以救灾济难为己任者，想必关怀。因之我特请两先生向国际和中国一切救济慈善团体，传达我们的呼吁，要求国民党军队及空军停止阻挠当地居民的抢险修堤工作，要求国民党水利机关及国际救济团体给当地居民以技术上物资上的紧急援助，以利河工的进行。倘蒙两先生慨允，并愿来解放区一商救济的具体问题，我们当竭诚欢迎。惟水势日迫，我们与两先生又无通航之便，故特借无线电广播表达我们的呼吁和请求，希望各外国通讯社于收听此广播后能代为送达郝思金斯与朱诺德两先生，以援救千百万人民的生命，我们将不胜感激之至。
