　　Ji-Lu-Yu Ninth Prefecture Committee Calls for Learning from Chalu Point Planting Experience
    [Another News] The Ji-Lu-Yu Ninth Prefecture Committee issued a circular calling on cadres at all levels to learn from the experience of the Chalu Village work team in the Fourth District of Nanfeng in leading the masses to resist drought and plant seeds, and to turn point planting and watering seedlings into a mass movement. The Prefectural Committee summarized the experience of Chalu Village in leading point planting, stating: Educate Party members and activists, make a breakthrough at one point, set an example while expanding propaganda, use facts to persuade the masses, and break the old habit of relying on the heavens for food; cadres should conduct in-depth leadership, personally take action, provide specific help, develop from a few to a majority, and develop the point planting movement into a upsurge. The Prefectural Committee also pointed out that many comrades always want a call to be made and the masses to respond, are unwilling to start from the smallest things, look down on a load of water and a sweet potato seedling, and are unwilling to work hard and go deep, starting by uniting a few activists, and as a result, the call will inevitably fail. The circular called on everyone to start with planting sweet potatoes, and further point-plant major crops such as beans and corn, from point planting to watering seedlings, from nearby land to distant land. Each step should implement typical demonstrations, make a breakthrough in one or several households, set an example, use facts to educate the masses, and gradually improve the masses' awareness and confidence, turning point planting, watering seedlings, drought resistance, and preparedness against famine into a conscious movement of the masses.
    [Another dispatch] The Nanfeng Tanzhuang work team leads the masses in point planting and watering seedlings. When the work team first mobilized the masses, they met with resistance. Tan Xi Jiu said: "Comrades, I am not as good as you at doing work, but you are not as good as me at planting crops. I have thought of everything, and the method you said is not right!" At the same time, others said: "People are busy but the heavens are not, and when the heavens are busy, it's only one rain, ... a downpour will plant everything." The work team studied the masses' thinking of "waiting" and "relying on the heavens," and believed that if they really wanted to mobilize the masses, they must take action themselves and first help a few households. So, they repeatedly propagated to Tan Kezun and got through to him. He decided to first plant the seven or eight fen of land in the northeast corner of the village near the well, and the work team helped him carry water, dig ditches, and cover the soil to plant the seeds. When the masses saw this, their thinking began to change, and Zhong Henian, the vice chairman of the farmers' association, also agreed to plant seeds as soon as possible, saying: "Crops cannot be delayed, planting one day earlier makes a difference." Tan Datu and his brother planted six or seven fen of corn and wanted to plant another two fen of carrots. He said: "Planting these carrots and mixing them with corn, in case of disaster, it will be enough for a family of six or seven to eat for a month." Erdahei's land is in the south, far from the well. He used a trailer to carry three water tanks, and used three small oxen to pull the water to the field. He pulled thirty-six loads of water in four trips and quickly planted the seeds. They mostly use the furrow planting method, turning the land into furrows, putting the seeds down, sweeping it with a broom from the furrow, covering it with a layer of floating soil, and then watering it until the water reaches the height of the furrow ridge. Some people dig the furrows first, then water them before sowing.

　　冀鲁豫九地委号召学习岔楼点种经验
    【又讯】冀鲁豫九地委发出通报，号召各级干部学习南峰四区岔楼村工作组领导群众抗旱点种的经验，把点种浇苗造成群众运动。地委总结岔楼村领导点种的经验称：教育党员和积极分子，突破一点，一边作出样子，一边扩大宣传，用事实说服群众，打破群众靠天吃饭的老习惯；干部深入领导，亲自下手，具体帮助，由少数发展为多数，把点种运动发展成热潮。地委同时指出，许多同志总想一声号召，群众响应，不肯从点滴作起，看不起一担水一棵红薯，不肯艰苦深入，由团结少数积极分子作起，结果号召必然落空。通报中号召大家由栽红薯作起，进一步点种大庄稼如豆子、棒子等，由点种引到浇苗，由近地引到远地。每一步都要贯彻典型示范，突破一户或几户，作出样子，用事实教育群众，步步提高群众觉悟如信心，把点种、浇苗、抗旱备荒，造成群众自觉的运动。
    【又电】南峰谭庄工作组，领导群众点种浇苗。工作组刚向群众动员时碰了钉子，谭西九说：“同志：干工作俺不如您，种庄稼您不如俺。俺啥都想到了，您说的法不中！”同时还有的说：“人忙天不忙，天忙只一场，………哗啦一场啥都中了。”工作组研究了群众这种“等待”、“靠天”的思想情况，认为要想真正把群众动员起来，必须亲自动手，首先帮助几户。于是向谭可尊反复宣传，打通了他的思想。他确定先点种村东北角靠井近的那七八分地，工作组就动手帮他挑水、挖沟、盖土，把种点上。群众看见，思想开始转变，副农会主席钟合年也赞同及早点种了，他说：“庄稼不让晚，早种一天一个样”。谭大突和他弟弟种了六、七分玉蜀黍，还要再种二分红萝卜。他说：“种这点红萝卜，掺点棒子，遇着灾荒一家六七口可以够吃一个月”。二大黑的地在南头，距井远，他用拖车载上三个水缸，用三个小牛把水拉到地里，四趟拉了三十六挑水，很快把种点上了。他们多用批沟点种法，将地批成沟，把种放下去，用笤帚从沟中扫一遍，盖上一层浮上，再浇水，水浇到沟背齐。也有先把沟批好，先浇水后下种的。
