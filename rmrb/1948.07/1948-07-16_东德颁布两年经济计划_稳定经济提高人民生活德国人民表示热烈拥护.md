Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. TASS reports: The attention of the public in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany is now focused on the first two-year economic plan for the Soviet-occupied zone. The draft of this plan was proposed by the German Socialist Unity Party, formulated by the German Economic Commission, and approved by the Soviet military government. "Deutsche Nachrichten" stated that this plan is designed to establish a stable economy and improve the living standards of residents in the Soviet-occupied zone. The Soviet-occupied zone's two-year economic plan (from 1948 to 1950) aims to restore and develop the peacetime economy of the Soviet-occupied zone. It stipulates that by 1950, electricity production in the Soviet-occupied zone will reach 15.5 billion kilowatt-hours (a kilowatt-hour is the work done by one kilowatt of power in one hour), an increase of 25 percent compared to 1947; lignite will reach 123 million tons, exceeding the 1936 level by 21.5 percent; steel production will reach 850,000 tons; rolled metal will be 650,000 tons; iron production will be 860,000 tons; the total output of the chemical industry will increase by 46 percent compared to 1947; and liquid fuel will increase by 29 percent. Railway transport volume will also greatly increase. By the end of the two-year plan, trains will have 80,000 passenger cars. The plan stipulates that the supply of consumer goods will greatly increase starting in the second half of this year. By the end of the two-year plan, textile production will reach 138 million meters, and shoes and socks will reach 20 million pairs. Food industry production will increase substantially; for example, sugar will reach 750,000 tons. The planting area for grains and other food crops has already increased by 450,000 hectares (one hectare equals sixteen Chinese acres) in 1947-1948 compared to 1945 and 1946. Livestock has also increased compared to 1945, with cattle increasing by 14 percent, horses by 9.6 percent, pigs by 76 percent, and sheep by 40 percent.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. TASS reports: The first congress of state-owned enterprises in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany passed a resolution supporting the two-year economic plan for the Soviet-occupied zone. The congress was held in Leipzig on July 4th, with a total of 8,000 representatives attending. Heinrich Rau, Chairman of the German Economic Commission, delivered the opening speech, thanking the Soviet-occupied zone authorities for their assistance in restoring the German economy. Herrnstadt reported on the current tasks of state-owned enterprises, pointing out that the socialized sectors of the Soviet-occupied zone constitute the foundation of planning and management policies, and emphasized the necessity of establishing trade relations between the Soviet-occupied zone and Eastern European countries.
