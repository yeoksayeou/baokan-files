Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: The Fifth Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation was held in Rome from May 15th to 19th. Representatives from the Soviet Union, the Chinese Liberated Areas, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, and Vietnam attended the meeting. The meeting passed a resolution: to pay tribute to the women of the Chinese Liberated Areas and to elect Cai Chang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Chinese Liberated Areas, as Vice-Chairperson of the International Democratic Women's Federation. Mrs. Gordon, Chairperson of the Federation, wrote to Comrade Cai Chang on May 29th, saying: "The report you sent us is very valuable. It allows us to understand the progress of the women's movement in the Chinese Liberated Areas and its outstanding achievements. We are all proud to have such a brave patriot and enthusiast as you as our Vice-Chairperson. Our Federation understands that in order to adapt to the requirements of the new era, we should strengthen the work in the Far East. Ms. Lu Cui in the Paris Federation Secretariat has already made our work in the Far East more valuable this year." The meeting also issued a letter to Asian women and decided to hold an Asian Women's Conference in southern Asia this autumn, hoping to get help from the Women's Federation of the Chinese Liberated Areas. The letter to Asian women stated: "The International Democratic Women's Federation announces to our Asian sisters that it will support your struggle against imperialist forces. This struggle is decisive in ending the imperialist crimes of the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and France against people who desire freedom. We pay tribute to the heroism of Chinese women and the Chinese people! We pay tribute to the women of Vietnam and Indonesia! We proudly praise the victories you have already achieved, just as those already achieved in the Chinese Liberated Areas and North Korea. These successes are a great encouragement to all oppressed women in Asia. The purpose of the Asian Women's Conference is to discuss some of the most important issues, such as: the solidarity of Asian women and world women for national independence, for democracy, and for peace; the issue of guaranteeing women's rights; and the issue of protecting children." The meeting also decided to convene the Second Congress of the International Democratic Women's Federation in November this year and adopted a declaration to women worldwide.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: After studying the reports of the investigation committees in India, Burma, and Malaya, the Fifth Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation decided to convene an Asian Women's Conference in the autumn. The content of the decision is as follows:
    "In order to assist those Asian women who are fighting for rights, for freedom, for democracy, and for peace, the International Democratic Women's Federation makes the following decisions:
    Before the Second International Women's Congress, convene an Asian Women's Conference in order to strengthen the solidarity of Asian women and, through the International Democratic Women's Federation, to unite women around the world to strive for independence and to guarantee the rights of women and children.
    Invite women representatives of democratic movements in colonial and dependent countries, as well as other countries, to demonstrate the commonality of women's struggles worldwide.
    Entrust the Secretariat and the Asian Committee to participate in the preparation of the conference and to jointly organize a preparatory office with the representatives of Asian countries and the representatives of participating groups.
    The governments of various countries should help prepare a sum of money for the conference.
    Endeavor to use newspapers and magazines to announce to the branches in various countries and to women around the world the suffering inflicted on women and children by colonialism and their extremely tragic situation, and to submit the committee's opinions to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the Commission on the Status of Women, and the International Labour Office."
