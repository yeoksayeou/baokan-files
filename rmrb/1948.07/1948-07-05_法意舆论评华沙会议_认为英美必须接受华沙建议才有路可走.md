Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: French and Italian democratic newspapers, commenting on the results of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Warsaw Conference, warned that the US and Britain must carefully consider the responsibility they bear for abandoning four-power consultation. TASS reported: The French newspaper L'Humanité wrote: "While the newspapers of the American faction are using the events in Berlin to spread a bellicose atmosphere, the new democratic countries and the Soviet Union are formulating terms for lasting peace in Warsaw, which will win the approval of all countries." L'Avanguardia, Libération, and Combat all emphasized the necessity and possibility of starting four-power consultations. Libération wrote: "France did not obtain the security guarantees it needed at the London Conference. France needs to change its foreign policy." Rome's Paese Sera wrote: "Now, Britain and the US must bear full responsibility, and they must carefully weigh the entire situation. If the Western countries merely reject the Warsaw Conference's proposals, they will lose the last bit of sympathy from all strata of the German people. The Western countries must accept the Warsaw proposals and immediately begin four-power negotiations. This is the only road left to them."

　　法意舆论评华沙会议
    认为英美必须接受华沙建议才有路可走
    【新华社陕北三日电】在评论八国外长华沙会议的结果时，法意的民主报纸警告说，美英诸国须仔细考虑他们放弃四国协商而应负的责任。塔斯社报导：法国的人道报写道：“当美国派的报纸利用柏林的事件散布好战的气氛时，各新民主主义国家和苏联却在华沙拟定了持久和平的条款，这将博得各国的赞许”。义勇军报、解放报和战斗报都强调开始四国协商的必要和可能。解放报写道：“法国在伦敦会议上没有得到她所须要的安全的保证。法国须要改变外交政策。”罗马的时代晚报写道：“现在，英美要负全部责任，它们必须仔细权衡全部情况。如果西方国家仅只拒绝华沙会议的建议，那么，它们将丧失德国各阶层人民的最后一点同情。西方国家必须接受华沙建议，并立即开始四国谈判。这是留给他们的唯一道路。”
