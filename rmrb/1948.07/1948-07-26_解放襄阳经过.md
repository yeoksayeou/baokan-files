　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 21st: A front-line reporter reports on the liberation of Xiangyang, stating: After the People's Liberation Army successively captured towns such as Laohekou, Guanghua, Gucheng, Nanzhang, and Yicheng on both sides of the Han River starting on July 2nd, they advanced towards Xiangfan along the Han River. On the evening of the 7th, they completely surrounded both locations. On the 9th, the People's Liberation Army captured Fancheng and, braving the intense heat and poison gas bombs released by the Chiang bandits, successively removed commanding heights such as Pipa Mountain, Fenghuang Mountain, Zhenwu Mountain, and Hei Hu Yan south of Xiangyang city. The Chiang bandits' 15th Pacification Zone Command, 104th Brigade, and local Chiang forces, totaling 16,000 men, retreated and gathered inside the city to resist stubbornly. At 20:30 on the 15th, our army began to attack the city, first destroying all the city wall fortifications. Within five minutes, the assault team crossed three small moats and layers of barbed wire obstacles, and climbed onto the city wall. At this time, the enemy counterattacked several times, but were repelled by us. Our army then advanced deeper. After fierce street-by-street and house-by-house fighting, most of the defending enemies were annihilated, leaving only the Chiang bandit Pacification Zone Command and more than one regiment holding the Zhonggulou (Bell and Drum Tower) two strongholds, struggling desperately. From the 10th to the 18th hour, we annihilated all the remaining bandits and captured the notorious Chiang bandit secret service leader Kang Ze alive. The famous city of Xiangyang was completely liberated.

　　解放襄阳经过
    【新华社中原前线二十一日电】前线记者报导解放襄阳经过称：七月二日起，解放军于先后攻占汉水两岸的老河口、光化、谷城、南漳、宜城等城镇后，即沿汉水向襄樊挺进。七日黄昏将该两地全部包围。九日解放军攻克樊城，并冒酷热及蒋匪施放的毒气弹，次第拔除襄阳城南的琵琶山、凤凰山、真武山、黑虎堰等制高点，蒋匪十五绥靖区司令部一○四旅及土蒋等共一万六千人乃退聚城内顽抗。十五日二十时三十分，我军开始攻城，先将城垣工事全部摧毁，五分钟内突击队越过三道小壕及层层铁丝等障碍，登上城头。此时敌数度反扑，均被我打退。我军随即向纵深发展。经逐街逐屋的激烈巷战，守敌大部就歼，仅剩下蒋匪绥区司令部和一个多团坚守钟鼓楼两个据点，作垂死挣扎。十至十八时，我将残匪全部歼灭，活捉著名蒋匪特务头子康泽，襄阳名城乃告全部解放。
