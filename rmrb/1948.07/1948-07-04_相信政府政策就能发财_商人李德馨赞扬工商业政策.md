　　“Believing in Government Policies Leads to Wealth”
    Businessman Li Dexin Praises Industrial and Commercial Policies

    [Taihang News] After receiving the wrongfully confiscated pigments and cash back from the government, Wu'an businessman Li Dexin was very moved. He said, "The government corrects its mistakes when it finds them, truly practicing what it preaches. Now that I have everything back, how can I not work hard?" After more than a month of diligent operation, a brand-new general store is gradually expanding. He adopted a policy of small profits and quick turnover; while others aim for a 5% profit, he only takes 2%, and his business is very good. He constantly promotes this to other merchants and explains the situation to those who are still afraid to return. In Handan, he met Kong Suixi, the shopkeeper who had been involved in the handicraft industry troubles, and told him about his own recovery. These people are returning one after another. The government is returning all the entrusted materials to them, and everyone is actively running their businesses. Li Dexin said, "Commerce will develop greatly in the future, as transportation is convenient now, and travel is much easier." He also said with full confidence: "Today, as long as you believe in the government's policies, you can get rich."

    [Taihang News] Businessman Cheng Shiquan wrote a letter to the newspaper, saying that he "untied a big knot that had been tied for five years." The original letter is as follows: I am Cheng Shiquan from Qiaoshang Village, First District, Huguan. My family was very poor since I was a child. My father was a coppersmith, and I went out to learn coppersmithing from my father for six years when I was thirteen. At the age of twenty, I learned masonry for another two years. At the age of twenty-three, I started doing business. Now I am forty years old, and I am still doing business outside. There are four people in my family, and we cultivate thirteen and a half mu of land. Because I didn't understand the Communist Party's policies in the past, I didn't dare to go home when I was doing business outside, fearing that the masses would struggle against me. In the past, I thought that doing business was exploitation, and I often regretted that I shouldn't have become a businessman. Thinking about it, I always felt that businessmen had no future. This knot has been tied since the movement in 1942 and has been tied for five years. After Comrade Cheng Laigui from my village repeatedly wrote letters to explain, I was always half-believing and half-doubting, and I didn't dare to boldly go home. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, I returned to the village and initially approached the masses. The cadres and masses in my village were very good to me. Not only did they not struggle against me, but they also allocated a plot of land to me. At this time, I untied the knot that had been tied for five years. After seeing the Central Bureau's instructions on correcting leftist tendencies, various places have compensated the wrongly struggled middle peasants and returned the struggled industrial and commercial enterprises. At the same time, the policy stipulates developing industry and commerce and protecting industry and commerce. I then realized that our current revolution is about confiscating bureaucratic capital. After understanding this policy, the knot in my mind was completely untied. I hope that fellow businessmen from all over the country will refer to and study this letter I wrote. Businessman Cheng Shiquan.

　　“相信政府政策就能发财”
    商人李德馨赞扬工商业政策
    【太行讯】武安商人李德馨接到政府退还错斗的颜料和现款后，非常感动。他说：“政府有了缺点就要改，真是说到作到。我现在什么都有了，还能不好好干？”他经过一月多的努力经营，一个崭新的杂货店正逐步扩展着。他采取了薄利广销的政策，别人看利五分，他只看二分，生意很好。他不断的向其他商人作宣传，对一时外出不敢回来的商人作解释。在邯郸遇见以前闹手工业的孔隋希掌柜，把自己恢复商业的情形告诉了他，这些人陆续回来。政府都把代管的物资退还给他们，大家都积极经营起来了。李德馨说：“以后商业还要大发展哩，现在交通方便了，来往也便当的多了。”他并充满信心的说：“今天只要相信政府政策，就能发财。”
    【太行讯】商人程士全给报纸写信，说他“解开结了五年的大疙瘩。”原信如下：我是壶关一区桥上村人，名叫程士全。从小家庭很贫，父亲是个铜匠，我十三岁时，也出外跟我父亲学铜匠六年。二十岁时，又学泥水匠二年。二十三岁时，又经营商业。到现在四十岁了，还是在外经商。家庭共有四口人，种有土地十三亩半。因我过去不了解共产党的政策，在外做买卖不敢回家，怕群众斗争自己。过去自己认为做买卖就是剥削者，时常后悔不该做商人，想来想去老想商人没前途。这个疙瘩自四二年运动开始就结上了，一直结了五年。经我村程来贵同志屡次写信解释，总是半信半疑，不敢大胆回家。自公布了土地法大纲后，我才回到村里，初步接近群众。我村干部群众对我很好，不但没有斗了我，还分到地基一处。在这个时候，才解开五年前结的疙瘩。又看到中央局纠左指示后，各地纷纷补偿错斗中农，退还被斗的工商业。同时政策规定发展工商业，保护工商业。我才认识到咱们目前革命是没收官僚资本。懂得了这个政策后，我的思想疙瘩才彻底解开了。我希望各地商界同胞们，对我写的这封信多加参考与研究。商人程士全。
