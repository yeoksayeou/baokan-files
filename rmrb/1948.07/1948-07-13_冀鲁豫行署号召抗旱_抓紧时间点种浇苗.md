Jilu Yu Administrative Office Calls for Drought Resistance
    Seize the Time to Plant and Water Seedlings

    [Jilu Yu News] In order to prevent and overcome the drought, the Jilu Yu Administrative Office has issued an emergency notice to all counties and districts, calling on them to seize the time to plant and water seedlings. It is said that there are only ten days left before the "beginning of Fu," which is a crucial moment for sowing autumn seedlings. Due to the drought, a significant portion of wheat stubble fields in some areas of the Sixth and Eighth Special Districts have not been planted. Some of the seedlings that have emerged are also at risk of dying from drought. Some areas also need to be replanted due to severe hail (Sixth Special District) and insect plagues (First Special District). We should learn from the lessons of previous years; if we don't plant at this time, even if it rains heavily in ten days, yields will be reduced. To avoid waiting for disaster, all special districts, counties, districts, and villages are called upon to seize the current planting season and organize the masses to transport water for planting, replanting, and watering seedlings in an organized and led manner to minimize the threat of drought. (1) Overcome the masses' mentality of relying on the heavens for food and waiting for rain. Overcome the cadres' attitude of waiting and dealing with things passively, as well as tailism. Explain that such attitudes will cause a serious famine. If the planting season is missed, even if it rains later, planting will still reduce the autumn grain harvest, resulting in a semi-famine year. Planting early is always better than planting late; the harvest will be different even if the seedlings are only a day apart. (2) Fighting against drought, planting, and watering seedlings are our current important tasks, and also an active way to break the masses' superstitious and backward mentality and stabilize people's hearts. Therefore, we must have the perseverance to persuade the masses and help them, not be swayed by the emotions of backward elements, and resolutely organize the active and enthusiastic members of the peasantry with labor experience to take the lead in planting, promote the general, and focus leadership on planting. The current planting is mainly sweet potatoes, corn, and mung beans, especially major crops such as sweet potatoes. All localities should seize the time, based on the masses' experience, requirements, and different geological conditions, and call on and organize the masses to plant, and not miss the opportunity. Animal power, manpower, especially male and female semi-labor forces, should be organized to use carts, vats, buckets, jars, pots, etc., to transport pit water, well water, and ditch water for planting and watering seedlings. (3) Regarding the method of watering seedlings, the masses in the Fourth and Sixth Special Districts created a method last year, which is to insert wooden pegs diagonally next to the seedlings down to the roots, then water with a pot, and then bury the opening level; this can keep them from drying out for seven or eight days. If it still does not rain after seven or eight days, this method can be used again to water from the other side. According to the experience of the Fourth Special District last year, those who planted before the rain, even though the rain was past the proper time, could still harvest four to six dou per mu; those who planted after the rain could only harvest two dou per mu, a difference of more than double. Moreover, early planting leads to early maturity and early harvest, which avoids the loss of early frost and allows for earlier wheat planting. Therefore, in relatively large drought areas, we should widely call on and mobilize every household in every village to organize every labor force and semi-labor force to participate in planting and watering seedlings. Each person should plant half a mu to one mu to prevent drought. In areas where the masses lack planting experience, more attention should be paid to in-depth mobilization, organizing activists to take the lead in demonstration to influence the general public.机关 cadres stationed in the villages should help the masses plant and water seedlings in a planned and organized manner, and take the initiative to influence and promote the masses. We should recognize that helping the masses plant and water seedlings is of greater significance than helping with the wheat harvest.

　　冀鲁豫行署号召抗旱
    抓紧时间点种浇苗
    【冀鲁豫讯】为了防止与战胜旱灾，冀鲁豫行署顷特向各县区发出紧急通知，号召抓紧时间，点种浇苗。据称：现在离“头伏”只有十几天了，正是播种秋苗的紧急关头。因天旱不雨，致六、八专区一部地区，很多麦茬地均未耩上。已经出土的小苗，有的也将旱死。有些地区因雹灾（六专区）、虫灾（一专区）严重，也需补种。应该接受往年教训，在这个时候如不点种，十天后即使大雨下了也会减收。为避免等待成灾，特号召各专、县、区、村，抓紧目前播种季节，有组织有领导的组织群众进行运水点种、补种和浇苗工作，以缩小旱灾威胁。（一）克办法服群众靠天吃饭、等待下雨的侥幸心理。克服干部等待应付的态度及尾巴主义。说明那种会造成严重灾荒。如果错过播种季节，即使以后下雨种上，也将使秋粮减收，形成半灾荒年景。早种总比晚种强，苗差一天收成就不一样。（二）与旱灾作斗争，点种、浇苗是我们当前的重要任务，也是打破群众迷信落后心理、安定人心的积极办法。因此，要有毅力的说服群众，帮助群众，不要为落后方面的情绪所动摇，坚决组织农民中积极的、有劳动热情、劳动经验的分子，首先带头点种，推动一般，领导重点应以点种为主。目前点种主要是红薯、玉蜀黍、绿豆，特别是红薯等主要作物。各地应根据群众经验、要求和地质的不同，抓紧时间，号召与组织群众点种，不得错过时机。应组织畜力、人力，特别是男女半劳动力，用大车、缸、桶、罐、壶等，灌运坑水、井水、沟水，进行点种浇苗。（三）浇苗方法，去年四、六专区群众曾有创造，即用木橛在苗旁斜插到根下，用壶灌水，然后埋平上口；这样可保持七、八天不旱，如七、八天后仍不下雨，可再用此法从另一边灌水。根据去年四专区经验，在雨前点种者，虽下雨已经过时，每亩仍能收四斗至六斗；雨后耩种者，每亩不过二斗，相差一倍之多。并且早种早熟早收，既避免早霜的损失，又可早日种麦。因此，在比较大的旱区，应广泛号召，动员每村每户，组织起每一劳动力和半劳动力，参加点种浇苗。每人要点种半亩至一亩，以防旱灾。在群众缺乏点种经验的地区，应更多注意深入动员，组织积极分子，带头示范影响一般。住村的机关干部，要有计划有组织的帮助群众点种浇苗，亲自动手影响推动群众。我们应认识帮助群众点种浇苗，比帮助麦收的意义更为重大。
