[Ji Lu Yu Telegram] During the Yellow River flood season, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has intensified its bombing of our villages along the river with American-made airplanes, disrupting the people's river management and hindering the progress of dike repairs and flood relief projects. On the 10th of this month, five Chiang airplanes took turns bombing Liqiao and other villages in Puyang County seven times, dropping more than 50 bombs and 40 incendiary bombs in Jiqiao. Three air-raid shelters collapsed, suffocating sixteen peaceful residents, and three people were killed. The entire village's houses suffered this disaster, with almost none intact. Zhong Liqiao was also attacked, but fortunately no one was injured, although some firewood and houses were destroyed.
