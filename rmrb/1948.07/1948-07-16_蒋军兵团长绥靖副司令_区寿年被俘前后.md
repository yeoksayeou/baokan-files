　　From the front line in Yudu, Xinhua News Agency, 14th: A front-line reporter reports the story of the capture of Qu Shounian, the Chiang Kai-shek army's Sixth Pacification Deputy Commander and Corps Commander, during the Yudu campaign: On the evening of July 1st, the People's Liberation Army launched a general attack on Longwangdian, 20 li northwest of Suixian County, where the Chiang army's Qu Shounian Corps headquarters was located. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's resistance gradually ceased after 3:00 AM on the 2nd, and Chiang's soldiers laid down their weapons one after another. At this time, a tank behind the Corps headquarters still tried to break through and escape. The People's Liberation Army soldiers immediately destroyed the tank's tracks, and the tank could no longer move, but its engine had not stopped, so the soldiers rushed onto the tank. At this moment, an officer with a pale face and dressed in American clothing crawled out of the tank. In a trembling voice, he shouted, "Please don't shoot, I am Corps Commander Qu Shounian." That noon, he was escorted to the front-line headquarters of the People's Liberation Army. On the 4th, the reporter saw Qu Shounian at the reception center for liberated Chiang army officers, at which point he had returned to normal. Qu praised the People's Liberation Army's high morale and fierce artillery fire to the reporter, saying it was completely beyond his expectations. Qu said, "In general, senior Chiang army generals are very pessimistic about the current war situation. Because of Chiang Kai-shek's erroneous strategic guidance and interference in the command of subordinates, many senior generals feel disappointed and distressed. For example, this time Chiang Kai-shek believed that the People's Liberation Army would not be able to fight continuously after the Battle of Kaifeng. Facts have proven that his judgment was wrong. Secondly, the Kuomintang army's troops only seek self-preservation, and rarely attack during combat; without attack, there is naturally no victory. For example, this time when I was besieged in Longwangmiao, I ordered the 72nd Division in Tiefosi, 15 li away from me, to launch a full-scale attack five times, but they did not move a single step. Moreover, there are contradictions between the troops, and they cannot coordinate with each other during combat. The main reason why Qiu Qingquan's Corps could not provide eastern aid this time was, of course, due to the strong resistance of the People's Liberation Army, but I believe that the contradiction between Qiu and Shen Chengnian also had a great influence. The fact that I was able to become Corps Commander this time is also related to the contradictions between Qiu and Shen. During the Southwest Shandong campaign, Qiu reported to the high command that Shen had disobeyed orders and 'left the battlefield without authorization.' The two have been incompatible ever since. In late June, in order to relieve the siege of Kaifeng, the high command hurriedly ordered me to form this corps. However, I had only been in office for two days, and other subordinates and directly affiliated corps were still in Shangqiu undergoing organization. I and my subordinate generals had not even met each other before we were suddenly surrounded by the People's Liberation Army." Shen Chengnian's 75th Division originally belonged to Qiu Qingquan's Corps, and was incorporated into Qu Shounian's Corps this time. It has been completely annihilated by our forces, and Shen himself has also been captured.

　　蒋军兵团长绥靖副司令
    区寿年被俘前后
    【新华社豫东前线十四日电】前线记者报导蒋军第六绥副司令兼兵团司令区寿年在豫东大战中被俘经过称：七月一日晚，解放军对蒋军区寿年兵团司令部驻地睢县西北二十里之龙王店发动总攻。经数小时激战，至二日晨三时后，敌人的抵抗逐渐停止，蒋军士兵纷纷放下武器。这时，在兵团司令部后面，有一辆坦克还想突围逃命。解放军战士当即炸毁了坦克的履带，坦克已不能行动，但它的发动机仍没有停止，战士们乃蜂拥登上坦克。这时，从坦克里面钻出来一个面色惨白、全身穿着美式服装的军官，他用发抖的声音呼叫：“请不要打了，我就是兵团司令区寿年。”当天中午，他即被护送到了解放军前线司令部。四日，记者在解放蒋军军官招待处看见了区寿年，这时他已恢复了常态。区向记者盛赞解放军的士气高昂和炮火猛烈，认为完全出于他的意料之外。区说：“一般蒋军高级将领对目前战局的看法都很悲观。因为蒋介石错误的战略指导，和干涉下级指挥，使得许多高级将领感到失望和苦恼。譬如这次蒋介石就认为解放军经过开封之战不能连续作战。事实证明他的判断错了。其次，国民党军的各部队都是只求自保，作战中很少攻击；没有攻击当然就没有胜利可言了。比如这次当我在龙王庙被国时，我曾五次命令离我十五里的铁佛寺七十二师全力出击，但他们一步也不动。而在部队间又互有矛盾，作战时不能协同一致。这次邱清泉兵团不能东援，主要原因当然是由于解放军强有力的阻击，但我认为邱和沈澄年之间的矛盾也很有影响。我这次能当上兵团司令，也是与邱、沈的矛盾有关的。在鲁西南作战时，邱曾呈报统帅部说沈不服从命令，‘擅自脱离战场’。两人从此就不能相容。六月下旬，为了解开封之围，统帅部就很仓促的命我来组成这个兵团。但我到职不过两天，其他僚属和直属各兵团都还留在商邱进行编制中，我和我的所属将领也还没有一一见过面，就突遭解放军包围了。”按沈澄年七十五师原属邱清泉兵团，此次划入区寿年兵团建制，已被我全部歼灭，沈本人亦被俘。
