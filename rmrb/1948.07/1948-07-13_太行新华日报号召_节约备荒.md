Taihang Xinhua Daily Calls for Thrift to Prepare for Famine

[Taihang News] Taihang's wheat harvest this year is relatively good, and the masses are delighted. However, most areas have not had thorough rain and are already showing signs of drought. The Taihang Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial calling on the masses in the entire region to pay attention to thrift and prepare for famine. The article stated: "This year's wheat harvest is very good, and the masses are very happy. During and after the wheat harvest, it is only natural that the people's lives will improve somewhat. However, we must pay close attention to the fact that we are still in a war environment, and we must pay attention to the threat of famine. In order to strive to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, we have a huge task of supporting the front lines. The enemy in the border areas of our region is still trying to seize grain at all times, which requires serious attention. Currently, various places are already experiencing a lack of rain. Some areas have not yet been sown after the wheat harvest, and in some areas, although they have been sown, the autumn seedlings are already suffering from drought. Our region experiences drought nine years out of ten, and the possibility of drought is very high. We propose: that we fully recognize the above situation, and that we must be thrifty and frugal with the wheat we have worked so hard to harvest, and not waste it, or eat and drink excessively. We hope to attract the attention of the masses in various places."

　　太行新华日报号召
    节约备荒
    【太行讯】太行小麦今年收成较好，群众喜形于色。但各地多未落透雨，已呈旱象。太行新华日报顷发表社论，号召全区群众注意节约，防备灾荒。该文称：今年麦子的收成很好，群众都很高兴。在麦收期间及麦收以后，群众生活稍加改善，也是人之常情。不过必须引起我们万分注意的，即我们还是处于战争环境，我们还要注意灾荒的威胁。为了争取早日打倒蒋介石，我们有巨大支援前线的任务。我区边地敌人还时时刻刻企图抢粮，尤须严重注意。目前各地已感缺雨，有的地区麦收后尚未下种，有的地区虽已下种，但秋苗已经旱了。我区十年九旱，旱灾的可能性是很大的。我们提出：要充分认识上述情况，对于我们辛辛苦苦收获的麦子，要省吃俭用，要细水长流，不要浪费，不要大吃大喝。希望能引起各地群众万分注意。
