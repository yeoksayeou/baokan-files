　　Counter-revolutionary Secret Agent Kingpin Kang Ze
    Kang Ze, the counter-revolutionary secret agent kingpin captured in Xiangyang, Hubei on the 16th, is from Anyue, Sichuan, and is 45 years old this year. In 1930, he served as the captain of the "Bandit Suppression" propaganda team in Gu Zhutong's bandit troops. The following year, the team was reorganized into the notorious Special Operations Unit, with Kang continuing as the commander until the unit was disbanded after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1932, he participated in initiating the core organization of the China Military Fascist organization, the Renaissance Society, and presided over its Cultural Department, one of the six major departments. He also served as the secretary of the Renaissance Society, leading all of its secret service work. He was one of the famous so-called "Four King Kongs" and "Thirteen Taibao" of the society. In order to train secret service personnel, Kang Ze organized the so-called "Xingzi Special Training Class" in Xingzi Town, Jiangxi, and from 1933 to 1939, he served as the director of the "Jiangling Central Military Academy Special Training Class" in Jiangling, Hubei, which was of the same nature. In 1935, he and He Guoguang guided Chiang Kai-shek's forces into Sichuan, and concurrently served as the so-called "Director of the Political Training Department of the Sichuan Headquarters," where he carried out large-scale anti-communism and massacred many revolutionary patriots in the province. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in 1938, he served as the director of the Second Department of the Political Department of the Military Commission in Wuhan, specializing in developing his criminal anti-communist secret service work in the Kuomintang army. After the establishment of the semi-fascist so-called Three People's Principles Youth League in 1939, he served as the central standing director and director of the organization department of the league until 1945, further spreading the fascist poison among some young people. In the spring of 1940, a rice-snatching incident occurred in Chengdu, and he took the opportunity to go there to arrest communists and revolutionary youth. In 1945, he was elected as a member of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and served as a member of the "Special Committee of the Central Party Headquarters," the party's highest anti-communist organization. This year, after Chiang Kai-shek suffered disastrous defeats everywhere, he attempted to resist the People's Liberation Army's offensive by implementing the so-called "pacification system" of total war, and established the Fifteenth Pacification Zone in Xiangyang, northern Hubei, with Kang Ze as the commander. Earlier this month, in battles with the People's Liberation Army, Kang instructed his troops to release large amounts of poison gas. However, this heinous secret agent and war criminal still could not escape being captured by the People's Liberation Army.

　　反共特务头子康泽
    十六日在湖北襄阳被俘的反共特务头子康泽，四川安岳人，今年四十五岁。一九三○年任顾祝同匪部的“剿赤”宣传大队队长，次年该队改为罪恶昭彰的别动队，仍由康任总队长，直至抗日战争爆发后该队解散之日止。一九三二年他参与发起中国军事法西斯组织复兴社的核心组织“力行社”，曾主持其六大处中的文化处，又曾任复兴社书记，领导该社一切特务工作，是该社有名的所谓“四大金刚”和“十三太保”之一。为了训练特务人员，康泽曾在江西星子镇组织所谓“星子特别训练班”，并自一九三三年至一九三九年任湖北江陵同一性质的“江陵中央军校特别训练班”主任。一九三五年与贺国光导引蒋介石势力入四川，兼所谓“四川行营政训处长”，在该省大肆反共，屠杀革命志士甚多。抗日战争期间，一九三八年任武汉军委会政治部第二厅长，专司在国民党军队中发展其罪恶的反共特务工作。一九三九年半法西斯的所谓三民主义青年团成立后，任该团中央常务干事兼组织处长直至一九四五年，使法西斯毒焰进一步蔓延到一部分青年中间。一九四零年春成都发生抢米事件，他曾借此赴该地大捕共产党人及革命青年。一九四五年当选为国民党六届中央执行委员，为该党最高反共组织“中央党部特种委员会”的委员，今年蒋匪于处处惨败之后，妄图以实行所谓总体战的“绥靖制”抵抗解放军的进攻，在鄂北襄阳设立第十五绥靖区，以康泽为司令。康在本月上旬与解放军作战中，曾指令所部大量施放毒气。但是这个穷凶极恶的特务罪魁和战争罪犯，仍然逃不了做人民解放军的俘虏。
