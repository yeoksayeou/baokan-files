Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th: Good news is pouring in from various parts of Central China regarding the grain protection campaign. In the past twenty days, over 600 enemies have been annihilated. On June 26th, enemy units from the Reorganized 4th Division, the Reorganized 23rd Division, and local bandits, totaling more than three regiments, invaded Huangqiao (northeast of Taixing) with hundreds of carts to loot grain. They were immediately routed by our local armed forces, with over 200 enemies killed or wounded. On the same day, we also annihilated over 80 members of the puppet security team, including the battalion commander, who had sallied forth from Taixing city. The local armed forces of the 6th Military Sub-district (governing Huaiyin, Shuyang, Lianshui counties, etc.) captured Nanjian, a central stronghold of the enemy north of Suqian, in mid-June, largely eliminating the local bandits in the Maling Mountain area and controlling the fertile grain-producing area north of Luoma Lake. The local armed forces of the 5th Military Sub-district (governing Yeting, Funing counties, etc.) routed an enemy company that was looting grain near Sujiazu, east of Huaian, on the 18th of last month, annihilating over 70 of them, including the company commander. On the 24th, the local armed forces of Haian (Haian town, newly established as a county) in the 1st Military Sub-district (governing Taixing, Rugao, Dongtai counties, etc.) intercepted three military speedboats and wooden boats of the Reorganized 4th Division sailing south from Dongtai, capturing over 40 of the division's quartermasters and others alive, and seizing a quantity of wheat and cotton. The local armed forces of the Huai-Bao Military Sub-district (newly established county between Huaian and Baoying) of the Jianghuai Military Region fought 54 battles in twenty days, thwarting the grain-grabbing conspiracy of the enemy's Provisional 35th Division and four battalions of the Reorganized 51st Division, annihilating over 200 enemies. In all the above battles, a total of nine machine guns and over 340 rifles and pistols were seized.
