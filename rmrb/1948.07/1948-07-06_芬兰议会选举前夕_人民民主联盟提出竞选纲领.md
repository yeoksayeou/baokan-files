Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. TASS, Helsinki: On the eve of the Finnish parliamentary elections (scheduled for July 1st and 2nd), the People's Democratic League, led by the Communist Party, and the joint camp of bourgeois and right-wing Social Democrats are engaged in an election struggle. The People's Democratic League has put forward a joint election platform. In terms of foreign policy, this platform advocates defending national independence and opposing imperialist attempts to interfere in internal affairs; ensuring peace on all borders and preventing Finnish territory from becoming a place for military adventures again; and striving for friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. In terms of domestic policy, the platform advocates the complete democratization of state institutions and the suppression of reactionaries; a thorough reform of taxation and the nationalization of large factories, banks, and key sectors of foreign trade. Prime Minister Pekkala of Finland (belonging to the Social Unity Party within the People's Democratic League) stated in a speech that the importance of this election is greater than in the past. Because whether the policies pursued by the current government will change depends on the outcome of the election. Our current political situation is not the same as in the past. The peace treaty concluded with the Soviet Union has political significance not only internationally but also domestically. Every voter should consider this fact. I sincerely hope that workers will elect candidates who represent the political trends that have gained momentum after the war in the upcoming election." The election speeches of the People's Democratic League have been warmly welcomed by the people. The circulation of left-wing newspapers and the number of members of the People's Democratic League and Communist Party members in various places are increasing daily.

　　芬兰议会选举前夕
    人民民主联盟提出竞选纲领
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬兰议会选举（定于七月一日至二日举行）的前夕，共产党领导的人民民主联盟与资产阶级及右翼社会民主党人的联合阵营之间展开了竞选斗争。人民民主联盟提出了联合竞选纲领。在对外政策方面，这一纲领主张保卫民族独立，反对帝国主义干涉内政的企图；确保全部边境线上的和平，阻止芬兰领土再度变为军事冒险的场所；力求与苏联及其他爱好和平国家友好合作。在对内政策方面，该纲领主张国家机构彻底民主化，压制反动分子；彻底改革税收，大工厂、银行及对外贸易首要部门国有化。芬总理皮可拉（属人民民主联盟中的社会统一党）发表谈话称：这次的选举，其重要性较之以往为大。因为本届政府所奉行的方针是否改变，就取决于选举的结果。我们现在的政治情势不是同于过去之政治情势的。与苏联缔结的和约，不但在国际上而且也在国内有着政治意义。每个选民都应该估计到这种事实。我谨以至诚盼望工人们在行将来临的选举中，选举那些代表战后得势的政治趋向的候选人。”人民民主联盟的竞选演讲，受到人民的热烈欢迎。左翼报纸的发行额，各地芬兰人民民主联盟盟员和共产党党员的数目都日益增加。
