　　[Beiyue News] In many counties of the Fourth Sub-district, women are actively participating in production, harmonizing families, and improving their social status. In Jingxing's eight districts, 2,151 women participated in wheat harvesting, sowing, and weeding. Zhao Su'e from Dongfangling, who is eighteen years old, is as capable as men in harvesting wheat and weeding; Zhang Rongni from Touquan Village did not have livestock, so she and Zhao Lianni exchanged labor, with the men plowing the land and the two of them sowing seeds, planting seven or eight mu in one morning. Ma Yu'ai and Liang Chou'ni, women from Wujiazhuang, each led a mutual aid team; Chou'ni's team had ten people, and they threshed five fields of wheat in one afternoon. Influenced by them, 103 women participated in mutual aid production. In Jianping's fifth district, more than 500 women from 36 villages made 1,300 pairs of shoes for the public, earning 28,600 chi of cloth in wages. They happily said, "This solves the clothing problem." More than 50 women in Jiajiakou, Quyang, sewed soles for a shoe factory, earning more than 14 million border currency in half a year. In Beigaoying Village, Zhengding, most of the men went out to work as boatmen, and the women took charge of watering the gardens and pulling water carts at home. Women were responsible for nearly half of the village's agricultural production. The family members of laborers going to the front and military dependents were also actively engaged in production. Wu Yulian, a female party member from Beiliangdu, Jingxing, organized seven military dependents to help each other in production, weeding two mu of sorghum in half an afternoon. As a result of women's active participation in production, family relationships were harmonized, and their social status was also improved. Liang Chou'ni's mother-in-law said, "My Chou'ni works really hard in the fields; our family relies entirely on her." Therefore, the mother-in-law cooks breakfast every morning to let Chou'ni rest. Wu Deshan, who is about sixty years old from Wujiazhuang, said, "In the past, we only said that women could not do anything, but now that they have added their efforts to the fields, we don't have to worry about not having enough to eat!" Many people said, "No wonder the government said it would improve the status of women; they are indeed doing it!"

　　北岳四分区妇女积极生产
  　社会地位提高家庭关系和睦
    【北岳讯】四分区许多县份的妇女积极参加生产，和睦了家庭，提高了自己的社会地位。井陉八个区，有两千一百五十一个妇女参加麦收、下种、锄苗。东方岭十八岁的赵素娥，割麦、锄苗都能顶上男子；头泉村张荣妮没有牲口，她和赵连妮变工，男人耕地，她们两个下种，一上午种了七八亩。武家庄妇女马玉爱、梁丑妮，每人领导一个互助组，丑妮组十个人，一后晌打了五场麦。在她们影响下，有一百零三个妇女参加了互助生产。建屏五区三十六个村有五百多个妇女给公家做鞋一千三百双，得工资布二万八千六百尺，她们高兴的说：“这可解决了穿衣问题。”曲阳贾家口五十多个妇女给鞋厂纳鞋底，半年共得边币一千四百多万元。正定北高营村男人大部外出撑船生产，妇女们在家浇园、拉水车，全村农业生产近一半由妇女担负。出征民工家属和军属妇女，同样积极生产，井陉北良都女党员吴玉莲，串通七个军属互助生产，半个后晌锄了二亩高粱。妇女们积极生产的结果，家庭关系和睦了，自己的社会地位也提高了。梁丑妮的婆婆说：“俺丑妮上地真苦啦，俺家全凭她哩”。婆婆因此每天早上做饭，叫丑妮休息。武家庄六十来岁的武德山说：“以前咱只说娘儿们能干个啥，现在地里添上她们这把手，还愁没吃的吗？”许多人说：“怪不得政府说要提高妇女，人家果然是行！”
