　　US Democratic Party Presidential Election
  　Truman Nominated Reluctantly
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] Reports from various sources: The Democratic Party, another major bourgeois party in the United States, following the Republican Party convention last month, convened a representative assembly in Philadelphia on the 12th of this month to formulate the party's election platform for this year and to nominate candidates for president and vice president. On the 14th, the conference adopted a reactionary platform basically identical to that of the Republican Party, advocating so-called regional collective defense and the abolition of the veto power stipulated in the United Nations Charter, boasting of its notorious Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan, and maintaining a strong military force. In order to win the votes of blacks and laborers, the party platform listed deceptive promises of so-called civil rights clauses and the abolition of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law, promises that stand in ironic contrast to the current ruling Democratic government's anti-communist, anti-labor, and anti-civil rights behavior. Sharp struggles occurred at the conference over the issue of nominating presidential candidates. Some groups within the party that originally supported Truman, such as the Americans for Democratic Action and Senator Pepper, turned against Truman before the conference and, together with reactionary Southern Democrats, demanded that Truman withdraw from the election and nominate the non-partisan Eisenhower as the party's presidential candidate in an attempt to salvage the Democratic Party's decline. However, this activity failed because Eisenhower refused to run as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate on July 6. In a situation where "everyone is unwilling to elect Truman" but also "cannot find anyone who can compete with him" (Associated Press), the conference passed the nominations of Truman and Kentucky Senator Barkley as the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates for this year on the evening of the 14th and the morning of the 15th. The conference closed on the 15th. However, a portion of Southern Democrats representing the interests of slave-owning landowners, due to conflicts with Truman over the so-called civil rights platform, withdrew from the conference on the 14th and held a Southern Democratic conference in Birmingham, Alabama, on the 17th, putting forward separate presidential and vice-presidential candidates. A serious split has formed among the Democratic reactionaries.

　　美民主党竞选总统
  　勉强提名杜鲁门
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方报导：美国另一个大资产阶级政党——民主党，继上月共和党大会之后，于本月十二日在费城召开代表大会，以制定该党今年的竞选政纲及提出正副总统候选人。大会于十四日通过与共和党基本上相同的反动政纲，即主张所谓区域联防与废除联合国宪章中所规定的否决权，吹嘘其臭名远扬的杜鲁门主义与马歇尔计划，以及维持强大的兵力。为了争取黑人与劳工的选票，该党政纲列举了所谓民权条款及废除塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法的欺骗诺言，这一诺言与目前执政的民主党政府的反共、反劳工、反民权的行为，适成富于讽刺的对照。大会在提出总统候选人问题上，曾发生了激烈的斗争。党内原来拥护杜鲁门的某些集团，如美国民主行动社及参议员泼贝尔等，于会前转而反对杜鲁门，并与反动的南方民主党人共同要求杜鲁门退出竞选，另提无党派的艾森豪威尔为该党总统候选人，以图挽救民主党的颓势。但是，他们这一活动因艾氏在七月六日拒绝出任民主党总统候选人而落空。大会在“大家不情愿选杜鲁门”、但也“找不出一个能和他对抗的人”（合众社）的局势下，于十四日晚及十五日晨先后通过提名杜鲁门与肯特基州参议员巴克莱为该党今年的正副总统候选人。大会于十五日闭幕。但代表蓄奴大地主利益的一部分南方民主党人，因在所谓民权政纲上与杜鲁门发生矛盾，于十四日退出大会并于十七日在阿拉巴马州之北明翰城举行南方民主党会议，提出了另外的正副总统候选人。民主党反动派之间，已形成了严重的分裂。
