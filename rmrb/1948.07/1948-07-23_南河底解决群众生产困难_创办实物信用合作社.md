　　South Hebei Solves Mass Production Difficulties
  　Establishing In-Kind Credit Cooperative
    [Our Newspaper] The Nanhe Village, the Ninth District of Wu'an, began a pilot in-kind credit cooperative last winter. Based on the principle of depositing and lending actual goods and benefiting both depositors and borrowers, it aimed to solve the difficulties faced by the masses in production capital and help mass production. In the past six months, 66 households have deposited goods, totaling 7,197 catties of grain and 53 catties of cotton. Forty-nine households borrowed goods, circulating a total of 13,085 catties of miscellaneous grains. The credit cooperative earned a total of 703 catties in dividends within six months. In the first three months, the borrowing households used the borrowed grain and cotton for production, earning an average net profit of 45,000 yuan per household. In the latter three months, mass sideline production was slightly affected due to land redistribution and the arrival of the wheat harvest. According to complete statistics from three households, they borrowed a total of 950 catties of millet for transportation, earning a net profit of 210,000 yuan.
    The in-kind credit cooperative was initiated and organized last winter by Comrade Zhang Xigui and Wu Dongsheng, the director of the village cooperative. At that time, commodity prices fluctuated, and the masses who had grain dared not easily use it for production, turning the grain into dead assets. Some people wanted to engage in transportation but lacked capital and had no place to borrow, which was very difficult. In response to this situation, Comrades Zhang and Wu decided to pilot an in-kind credit cooperative that would benefit both depositors and borrowers.
    In order to facilitate borrowing for the masses, the in-kind credit cooperative stipulated extremely flexible deposit and loan methods: Regardless of depositing or borrowing grain, there were no time limits or quantity restrictions. Depositors received dividends on a regular basis, and borrowers paid a monthly interest of three catties per hundred catties (two and a half catties for shoulder-pole traders). Depositors could deposit more if they had more, less if they had less, deposit whenever they had it, and withdraw whenever they needed it, which not only avoided waste and damage but also increased profits, and dividends were distributed regularly. Borrowers could borrow more if they needed more, less if they needed less, borrow whenever they needed it, and repay whenever they had it. The in-kind credit cooperative lent, sold, bought, and transported actual goods, which not only solved the difficulty of borrowing for the masses but also obtained appropriate profits, benefiting depositors. Over the past six months, depositors have profited and borrowers have earned money in the cooperative, which has won the support of the entire village. For example, Liu Da'wu, a poor peasant in the village, had no grain at home last winter, and his family was starving. Later, he borrowed 200 catties of millet. After half a year of transportation, he solved the livelihood of his family of six. After clearing his account this time, he still had more than 50,000 yuan left. After the wheat harvest, the masses are brewing plans to invest a large amount of wheat that they cannot eat for the time being. Director Zhang Xigui said confidently: "In the great production movement, we must make the credit cooperative even better." (Shang Kai)

　　南河底解决群众生产困难
  　创办实物信用合作社
    【本报讯】武安九区南河底村于去冬开始试办实物信用社，根据存实物贷实物、存贷两利的原则，解决群众生产资本的困难，帮助群众生产。半年来，存物者有六十六户，共存粮七千一百九十七斤，存棉五十三斤。贷物者四十九户，共周转杂粮一万三千八十五斤。信用社在六个月内共得红利七百零三斤，贷户前三个月用所贷粮棉投入生产，平均每户净赚四万五千元。后三个月因抽补土地与进入麦收，群众副业生产稍受影响。根据三户完整统计，共贷小米九百五十斤搞运输，净赚二十一万元。
    实物信用社在去冬由该村合作社长张西贵、吴东生二同志发起组织。当时物价涨落不定，群众有存粮者不敢轻易动用经营生产，把粮食变为死物。有人想搞运输却缺少资本，无处借贷，非常困难。根据这一情况，张、吴两同志便决定试办有利于存、贷双方的实物信用社。
    为了群众借贷方便，实物信用社规定了极灵活的存贷办法：不管存粮、贷粮，时间不限，数目不拘，存粮者按期分红，贷粮者每百斤出月利三斤（肩挑贸易者二斤半），存粮者，有多存多，有少存少，随有随存，随用随抽，既可避免浪费损坏，又能增加利润，按期分红。贷粮者，用多贷多，用少贷少，随用随贷，随有随还。实物信用社贷实物、卖实物、买实物、运实物，既解决了群众借贷的困难，又能获得适当利润，有利于存户。六个月来，在该社存粮者得利，贷粮者赚钱，已经获得全村群众的拥护。如该村贫农刘大吴，去冬家中无粮，全家断炊，后来贷了二百斤小米，经过半年的运输经营，已经解决了全家六口人的生活，这次结帐本利还清后，尚余五万多元。麦收后群众纷纷酝酿，把暂时吃不着的麦子大量入股。社长张西贵很有信心的说：“在大生产运动中，一定把信用社搞得更好。”（商恺）
