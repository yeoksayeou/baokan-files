　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. According to foreign news agencies and the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, Chiang Kai-shek's Central Trust Bureau in Shanghai, in order to seize huge profits and regardless of the life or death of national industry, has recently purchased 340,000 yards of woolen textiles from Japan. The first batch began to be auctioned in the middle of this month. It is reported that the total amount of Japanese woolens currently held by the Central Trust Bureau exceeds the annual output of Shanghai's Chinese wool textile industry. In order to survive, the Shanghai wool spinning and weaving industry and business community have successively lodged strong protests with the authorities in the early and mid-parts of this month, demanding an immediate halt to the auctions. The North China Students' Federation Against American Support for Japan and Rescuing the National Crisis also issued a protest on the 10th of this month, expressing support for the Shanghai Wool Spinning Association and opposing the "Central Trust Bureau's" dumping of Japanese goods.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao of May 16th, Chiang Kai-shek's Central Trust Bureau has also decided to transport 210,000 tons of Kailuan coal dust to Japan. The bureau has signed a contract with the "Overseas Shipping Joint Office," jointly formed by the Central Trust Bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Yihsiang, and China Xing Steamship Companies, for the transportation. In addition, a Central News Agency dispatch of May 2nd, quoting figures from the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, confirmed that Japan's steel production in the fiscal year ending March 30th of this year had increased by 74.5 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. The Central News Agency admitted: "The main reason is the acquisition of high-quality iron sand from Hainan Island."
