Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: London News: Several conservative British newspapers have recently made alarmed confessions about the plight of the British economy. The financial reporter of the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post said: "In the first five months of this year, the UK's international balance of payments deficit reached £213 million (Note: This figure is compared with the British government's estimated balance of payments deficit of £136 million for the first half of this year, exceeding the monthly average by more than £20 million, almost double). Despite all the government's measures to increase exports and reduce population, Britain is still in the same situation as a year ago." The Times editorial stated: "The deficit in Britain's overseas trade and the dollar shortage in the sterling area are far greater than the aid funds given to Britain in the Marshall Plan." The Economist magazine said: The British people face an inevitable future: "Even with Marshall Plan dollars, the British population will still have to make more painful cuts - and this currently means cutting the British standard of living." The Financial Times magazine said: "As a result of the government's current policies, the purchasing power of the people is declining."

　　五个月国际收支逆差二亿多镑
    英国经济穷困
    【新华社陕北二日电】伦敦消息：若干保守的英国报刊，最近对英国经济的困境作了惶恐的自白。每日电讯晨邮报财政记者说：“今年头五个月内，英国国际收支的逆差达二亿一千三百万镑（按：这个数目与英政府预计今年上半年的收支逆差一亿三千六百万镑比较起来，每月平均超过了二千万镑，即几达一倍）。尽管政府有增加出口和减少人口的一切措施，英国仍然处于一年前的境地。”泰晤士报社论说：“英国海外贸易的逆差和英镑区的美元短少，远较马歇尔计划中给英国的援助拨款为大。”经济学家杂志说：英国人民面临着一个不可避免的前途：“即使有马歇尔计划的美元，英国人口仍要作更痛苦的削减——而这在目前就意味着削减英国的生活水平。”金融时代杂志说：“由于政府现行政策的结果，人民的购买力正在向下降落。”
