　　Palestinian Communist Party Secretary
    Exposes Anglo-American Agreement to "Ceasefire" Aims to Give Arabs Breathing Room
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] TASS, citing a Czech Telegraph Agency dispatch, reports that the General Secretary of the Palestinian Communist Party, Mikunis (formerly translated as Mikus), pointed out at a press conference in Prague, Czech Republic on June 23rd: The so-called ceasefire in Palestine is merely a conspiracy of Anglo-American imperialism, the purpose of which is to give the Arab armies a chance to catch their breath and enable them to invade favorable strategic positions. The aim of Anglo-American imperialists is to incorporate the Jewish state into their system of Middle Eastern puppet states. Mikunis then condemned the Anglo-Americans for dragging their feet on the UN partition resolution, causing the bloody tragedy in Palestine. He further pointed out that all this is being done to further develop the Middle East for the oil companies of the imperialist powers.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 23rd: The "Nation Associates," an organization of publishers headed by Carey McWilliams, editor of "The Nation" magazine, recently submitted a memorandum to Truman, the UN Secretary-General, and the member states of the Security Council, condemning the Near East Division of the U.S. State Department, American oil capitalists, the British Foreign Office, and the Arab League for colluding with each other in an attempt to prevent the implementation of the UN resolution on the partition of Palestine. "Nation Associates" demanded that Truman dismiss those State Department officials who were conspiring to obstruct the partition of Palestine and legally recognize the provisional government of Israel.

　　巴勒斯坦共产党书记
    揭发英美同意“停战”目的在给阿喘息机会
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社引捷克电报通讯社消息称：巴勒斯坦共产党总书记米库尼斯（前译为米库斯）于六月二十三日在捷京布拉格记者招待会上指出：巴勒斯坦的所谓停战，只是英美帝国主义的阴谋，其目的在于给阿剌伯军队一个喘息的机会，并使阿军能够侵入有利的战略阵地。英美帝国主义者的目的，在于将犹太国家纳入他们中东傀儡国家的制度中。米库尼斯继而谴责英美对联合国的分治决议怠工，并造成巴勒斯坦的流血惨剧。继指出：这一切作为，就是要为帝国主义强国的石油公司进一步开拓中东作准备。
    【新华社陕北廿九日电】据塔斯社纽约二十三日消息：由“民族”杂志编辑主任克齐威为首而组成的出版家组织“民族之友”社，近将备忘录一份，递交杜鲁门、联合国秘书长氏及安理会各理事国，谴责美国务院近东司与美国石油资本家，英外交部与阿剌伯同盟各国相互勾结，企图阻止联合国对巴勒斯坦分治决议的实现。“民族之友社”要求杜鲁门将那些阴谋阻挠巴勒斯坦分治的国务院官员解职，并在法律上承认以色列临时政府。
