　　Western European Countries are Shackled by the US Dollar!
    Izvestia Comments on "Bilateral Agreements"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th] TASS, February: The Soviet newspaper Izvestia published an article titled "The Dollar Shackles of Western European Countries," stating that the United States is currently signing so-called bilateral agreements on the conditions of "aid" with each of the sixteen Western European countries individually. (Note: In addition to the previously reported bilateral agreements between the United States and Britain, France, Italy, Ireland, and Norway that have already been signed, bilateral agreements between the United States and Belgium, the Netherlands, and Austria were also signed on the 2nd). These agreements are nothing more than dollar shackles, aimed at reducing the economic independence of those countries that pin their hopes on American "aid." To prevent any collective opposition from the sixteen countries to the conditions of "aid," the United States prefers to negotiate with each country individually, as this makes these countries more docile and easier to impose harsh enslavement conditions upon. The Western European "recipient" countries are bound by specific obligations during the four-year term of the agreement, while the United States is not bound by the same obligations (Note: The US foreign aid plan is now stipulated to be decided annually by Congress). As a result, Western European countries will not be able to plan their economic lives, and their economies will depend on the policies of the United States and the economic changes that may occur at any time. This has already been proven by the recent decision of the US Congress to reduce foreign aid appropriations. Therefore, the so-called "bilateral agreements" are actually unilateral and unequal enslavement treaties. The content of the "bilateral agreements" will surely open the eyes of many people, allowing them to finally see the consequences of the rulers of the sixteen Western European countries participating in the Marshall Plan against the will of the people.

### 西欧各国套上了美元枷锁！　消息报评“双边协定”

　　西欧各国套上了美元枷锁！
    消息报评“双边协定”
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社二月讯：苏联消息报以“西欧各国的美元枷锁”为题撰文称：美国目前正与西欧十六国个个国家分别签订关于“援助”条件的所谓双边协定（按：除前已报导的美国与英、法、意、爱尔兰、挪威五国的双边协定业已签字外，美国与比、荷、奥的双边协定亦已于二日签字）。这些协定不过是一种美元枷锁，目的在于消减那些把命运寄托于美“援”的国家之经济独立。美国为了防止十六国对“援助”条件的任何集体反对，宁愿个别地与各国谈判，因为这样可使这些国家更驯服，更易于强加以严厉的奴役条件。西欧受“援”国在协定的四年期内，均负有确定的义务，而美国则不受同样义务的约束（按：美国“援”外计划，现规定由国会逐年决定），其结果，西欧各国将不能计划其经济生活，它们的经济将取决于美国政策和经济随时可能发生的变化，这已为美国会最近削减“援外”拨款的决定所证明。因此，所谓“双边协定”实际上是片面的不平等的奴役条约。“双边协定”的内容定将打开许多人的眼界，使他们最后地看到了西欧十六国统治者违反人民意志参加马歇尔计划的后果。
