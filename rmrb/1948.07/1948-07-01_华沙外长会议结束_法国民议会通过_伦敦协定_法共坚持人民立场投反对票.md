　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. TASS reports: The Foreign Ministers' Conference of eight countries, including the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary, concluded on June 24th. The June 24th meeting was chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the morning and Romanian Foreign Minister Puk in the afternoon. The meeting drafted a statement regarding the decisions on Germany made at the London Six-Power Conference.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly passed the London Six-Power Agreements late at night on the 16th of this month by a margin of eight votes, with 297 votes in favor and 289 votes against. In this diplomatic debate, the French Communist Party's members of parliament consistently adhered to the people's stance and fundamentally opposed this agreement, which violates the French national interests. When the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee discussed this issue on the 9th of this month, the French Communist Party proposed a motion demanding the fundamental rejection of the London Agreements. On the 10th, the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a public statement authorizing the French Communist Party's members of parliament to vote against the "London Agreements." A statement issued by the French Communist Party's parliamentary group pointed out: "The suggestions of the London Conference are unacceptable because they will promote the resurgence of reactionary and aggressive forces in West Germany, and they will negate the genuine guarantees of French security and legitimate demands for compensation." The statement also emphasized that "the London Agreements are the logical result of France deviating from its traditional allies—the Soviet Union and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe—and constantly sacrificing national interests to cater to the expansionist and aggressive plans of American millionaires and the reactionary schemes of a minority of privileged groups."
　　Commenting on the French Parliament's passage of the London Agreements, a commentator for the Soviet newspaper Pravda pointed out on the 20th: "Although the London decisions have been formally passed by the French Parliament, they will not be approved by the French people. The outcome of the French Parliament's vote foreshadows that the political struggle within France will become even more intense."

　　华沙外长会议结束
    法国民议会通过“伦敦协定”法共坚持人民立场投反对票
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社报导：苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克、南斯拉夫、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利等八国之外长会议，已于六月二十四日结束。二十四日的会议，上午由苏外长莫洛托夫主席，下午由罗外长波克主席。会议拟订了会议关于伦敦六国会议对德决定的声明。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】巴黎消息：法国国民议会于本月十六日深夜以二九七票对二八九票的八票之差，通过了伦敦六国协定。在这次外交辩论中，法国共产党国会议员始终坚持人民立场，根本反对这一违背法国民族利益的协定。当本月九日国会外委会讨论此一问题时，法共即提出议案，要求根本否决伦敦协定。十日，法共政治局发表公报，授权法共议员对“伦敦协定”投反对票。法共议会党团发表之声明指出：“伦敦会议的建议是不能接受的，因为它将助长西德反动侵略力量的再起，它将否定法国安全的真正保障与合法的赔偿要求。”声明又强调指出，“伦敦协定是法国背离它传统上的盟友——苏联与中欧、东欧国家之逻辑的结果，是不断牺牲民族利益以投合美国百万富翁的扩张与侵略计划和少数特权集团反动图谋的结果。”
    在论及法国议会之通过伦敦协定时，苏联真理报评论员于二十日指出：“伦敦决定虽然在法国国会正式通过了，但它是不会得到法国人民批准的。法国国会的表决结果，预告了法国国内的政治斗争将更加紧张化。”
