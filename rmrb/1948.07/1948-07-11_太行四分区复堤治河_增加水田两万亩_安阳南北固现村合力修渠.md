Taihang Fourth District Restores Embankments and Controls Rivers
Increasing Paddy Fields by 20,000 Mu
An'yang's Nanbeiguxian Villages Cooperate to Build Canals

[Taihang News] The Taihang Fourth District completed its spring embankment restoration and river control work before the wheat harvest, achieving an increase of 20,000 mu of paddy fields, a reduction of flood-affected area of 50,000 mu, and an increase in grain production of 45,000 shi. The flood season was the most distressing issue for local farmers, especially in recent years, as the enemy and puppets continuously destroyed and devastated the area, causing the riverbeds to be unmaintained and severely silted up. Last year, Qin (Yang) and Wen (County) suffered from floods, submerging over 100,000 mu of autumn crops. This spring, in addition to providing relief and organizing production locally, the democratic government, based on the urgent needs of the masses, led the people in Wen (County), Qin (Yang), Bo (Ai), and Wu (Zhi) counties to restore embankments and control rivers, completing the original plan in three months. In the Qin River, 34 dangerous sections were repaired, with a total length of 4,727 zhang, using 13,852 cubic meters of earth. 55 new retaining structures were built, 60 retaining structures were added or repaired, and 12 earth oxen were erected, totaling 31,885 workdays, using 2.27 million jin of materials, 855 straw ropes and reed ropes, 4,668 small wooden stakes, 285 large sign stakes (3.2 zhang long), and 497 jin of ramie and hemp thread (the above figures are statistics from Qin, Wen, and Wu counties). In the Dan River, a major dangerous project was built at Jiangling Fort, including a 48-zhang-long large stone dam, using 39,844 earthworkers, stoneworkers, and craftsmen, 9 million jin of stones, 2.25 million jin of lime, 250,000 jin of coal, and 220,000 jin of firewood. The Guangji River was also completed at this time, increasing paddy fields by 20,000 mu (see page one of this newspaper on June 20). In addition, 3,810 zhang of the Hehe River (small main river) were dredged, using 15,169 workdays. 25,390 zhang of the Menhe River (small tributary) were dredged, using 38,169 workdays. 720 zhang of the Da Gan River were dredged, using over 9,000 workdays. This year, Wen and Qin counties jointly dredged six large flood rivers (hanging water channels), ranging from 50 to 120 li in length. The flood rivers had been silted up for many years, and the banks had become waterlogged wasteland. Last year, approximately 100,000 mu of autumn fields were flooded. After this year's organized repairs, approximately 56,914 workdays were used. It is estimated that this year, the flood-affected autumn fields can be reduced by more than 50,000 mu.

The construction of the above four rivers cost a total of 172,050 jin of grain and 193,541 workdays, increasing paddy land by 20,000 mu (which could not be planted in the past due to lack of water). At one shi per mu, production can be increased by 20,000 shi; reducing flooded land by 50,000 mu, with each mu producing five dou more than last year, a total increase of 25,000 shi can be achieved. In total, this year's production can be increased by 45,000 shi. After the embankment restoration and river control, the masses said, "This year, the democratic government has grasped our heart's worries."

[Taihang News] An'yang Sixth District Nanbeiguxian Villages, with the support of the democratic government, cooperated to build canals, expanding irrigated land by more than 2,000 mu, and resolved the famine problems of some of the masses with grain loans. Nanbeiguxian are two villages in the Sixth District with relatively more dry land, totaling 4,131 mu, with 1,108 mu of irrigated land. The 328 mu of irrigated land in Beiguxian often could not be watered, and in reality, only the 700-plus mu of land in Nanguxian could be irrigated. The initial wells were four or five zhang deep, and five people could not irrigate even one mu per day on average, costing a lot of labor. Later, the canal wells were dug from the Datong Canal in the northeast of the village, and the wells were 1.5 zhang deep. Five people could irrigate two to three mu per day, saving much more labor than before. However, the soil of the Datong Canal was not good and collapsed every year, and the masses had a request to renovate the canal. This spring, the cadres of the two villages met and invited several old men who had worked on water conservancy in the past to discuss and make plans together. Nanguxian Village advocated that the canal should flow to the east of the village this time, while Beiguxian advocated that it should flow to the west of the village. After repeated discussions, both parties agreed to set up a water diversion point in the south of Nanguxian Village, with one stream flowing to the northeast of Nanguxian Village and one stream flowing due north, which was suitable for irrigating land in both villages. The masses said, "It's good, but we really have difficulty with food." Upon hearing this, the leaders sent Section Chief Ma of the County Government Cooperation Section to personally help the masses measure the canal, organize laborers, and solve various specific difficulties. The government approved an allocation of 20,000 jin of canal construction loan grain, and rice was immediately distributed, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of the masses to build the canal. At this time, a canal construction committee was established to be responsible for leading the canal construction. In order to accelerate work efficiency, a contracting method was studied in advance, and different wage rates were determined according to the different depths of the wells. When repairing, priority was given to disaster victims, refugees, and the poor who had no way to live, and there were no village restrictions. People from other villages could also participate, thus solving the famine problems of some people. Starting from March 26, in less than a month, a canal of 1,129 zhang long was dug, expanding irrigated land by 2,000 mu.

　　太行四分区复堤治河
    增加水田两万亩
    安阳南北固现村合力修渠
    【太行讯】太行四分区今春复堤治河工作，在麦收前全部完成，获得增加水田两万亩，减少水患五万亩，增加产粮四万五千市石的成绩。河水汛期为当地农民最感苦恼的一件事，特别是近年以来，敌顽不断破坏摧残，河身失修，淤塞厉害，去年沁（阳）温（县）两县遭受水灾，淹没秋禾达十万余亩。民主政府今春除在当地设法救济和组织生产外，特根据群众迫切需要，在温（县）、沁（阳）、博（爱）、武（陟）四县领导群众复堤治河，三个月完成原定计划。计在沁河修筑险工三十四处，长四、七二七丈，用土方一三、八五二方。新筑埽台五十五个，加厢埽台（修补）六十个，屯土牛十二个，共用工三一、八八五个，用料二二七万斤，草绳、苇绳八五五条，小木桩四、六六八根，大签桩（三丈二尺长）二八五根，菁麻线麻四九七斤（以上数字是沁温武三县的统计）。丹河修筑江陵堡大险工一处，长四十八丈的大石坝一段，用土工、石工、匠工等三九、八四四个，石头九百万斤，石灰二二五万斤，煤炭二五万斤，木柴二二万斤。广济河亦于此时兴修完竣，增加水田两万亩（见六月二十日本报一版）。此外并挑和河（小干河）三、八一○丈，用工一五、一六九个。挑门河（小支河）二五、三九○丈，用工三八、一六九个。挑大干河七二○丈，用工九千余个。温、沁两县今年共同疏通六条大涝河（挂水渠），长五○里至一二○里不等，涝河多年淤塞，两岸尽成水淹荒田，去年约淹秋田十万余亩，经过今年组织开修，约用工五六、九一四个。估计今年可减少水淹秋田五万余亩。
    修筑以上四河，共开支粮一七二、○五○斤，用工一九三、五四一个，增加水地两万亩（过去无水不能种），每亩以一市石计，可增产两万石；减少淹地五万亩，每亩比去年多产五市斗，共可增产两万五千市石，总共今年能增产四万五千市石。修堤治河以后，群众说：“民主政府今年抓住了咱们的心病”。

    【太行讯】安阳六区南北固现村在民主政府扶持下合力修渠，扩大水地两千余亩，并以贷粮解决了部分群众的灾荒问题。南北固现是六区旱地较多的两个村，共地四一三一亩，有一一○八亩水地。北固现的三二八亩水地经常浇不到水，实际只南固现的七百余亩地能浇水。起初的水井都有四、五丈深，五个人一天平均浇不了一亩，费工很多。后来从村东北大同渠挖透渠井，井深一丈五尺，五个人一天能浇二亩至三亩，比过去省工多了。但大同渠土质不好，年年倒塌，群众都有改修渠道的要求。今年春天，两村干部碰了头，找来过去搞过水利的几个老汉，共同商量，作了计划。南固现村主张这次修渠要往村东流水，北固现则主张往村西头流。经过反复酝酿圪扯，双方同意在南固现村南设一分水口，一股水向南固现村东北流，一股水向正北流，两村浇地都很合适。群众说：“好倒是好，就是吃食实在困难。”领导上听到这个意见，便派县府合作科马科长亲自帮助群众测量水渠，组织民工，解决各种具体困难。政府批准拨给二万斤修渠贷粮，立刻发下米来，群众修渠劲头越大了。这时成立了修渠委员会，负责领导修渠。为了加速工作效率，事先研究了包工办法，按照井的不同深度，决定不同的工资米。修时先尽生活无办法的灾民、难民和贫民来修，不为村限制，别村的人也可参加，这样就解决了一部分人的灾荒问题。从三月二十六日起，不到一月，已将长一一二九丈的水渠挖成，扩大了水地两千亩。
