At 10:00 AM on the 20th, it recovered Xushui County, about 50 li north of Baoding on the Pinghan Railway, annihilating the remnants of the 3rd Regiment of the Provisional 31st Division of the enemy's New 2nd Army and the county's security forces. Thus far, the People's Liberation Army on the Ping-Bao Frontline, which began its offensive operations on the 15th, has captured the four cities of Laishui, Xincheng, Dingxing, and Xushui. The headquarters of the enemy's New 2nd Army Provisional 31st Division and its three subordinate regiments, which were defending the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, have been completely annihilated.
