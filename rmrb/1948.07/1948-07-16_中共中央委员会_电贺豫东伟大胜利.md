    Cables Congratulations on the Great Victory in Eastern Henan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th] The CCP Central Committee has sent a cable congratulating the great victory in Eastern Henan. The original cable is as follows:
    To Comrades Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yi, Su Yu, Li Xiannian, Deng Zihui, Song Renqiong, Zhang Jichun, Chen Shiqu, Tang Liang, and all comrades of the East China and Central Plains People's Liberation Army:
    We celebrate your great victory in Eastern Henan, following the victory in Kaifeng, in annihilating over 50,000 enemy troops from the Qu Shounian and Huang Botao corps of the Chiang faction. In this Battle of Suiqi, the Chiang bandits, in order to resolve the crisis of their Qu Shounian and Qiu Qingquan corps being encircled and annihilated by our forces, successively mobilized 32 regular brigades, a rapid column, and a traffic police corps, totaling 270,000 troops. However, after nine days and nights of fierce fighting, they ultimately could not escape this disastrous defeat, and senior generals such as Qu Shounian and Shen Chengnian were captured alive by our forces. This glorious victory is a head-on blow to Chiang Kai-shek's ravings about "purging the Central Plains"; at the same time, it also enables our army to enter the third year of the Chinese People's Liberation War advantageously. In this sweltering heat, we extend our regards to the comrades. We hope you will continue your efforts to annihilate more Chiang's enemies and liberate all the people of the Central Plains!
    　　　　　　　　　　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, July 11, 1948

　　中共中央委员会
    电贺豫东伟大胜利
    【新华社陕北十三日电】中共中央顷电贺豫东大捷，原电如下：
    刘伯承、邓小平、陈毅、粟裕、李先念、邓子恢、宋任穷、张际春、陈士渠、唐亮诸同志，及华东和中原人民解放军全体同志们：
    庆祝你们继开封胜利之后，在豫东歼灭蒋敌区寿年兵团、黄伯韬兵团等部五万余人的伟大胜利。此次睢＠战役，蒋匪为解救其区寿年、邱清泉两兵团被我围歼的危机，竟先后调动了三十二个正规旅及一个快速纵队、一个交警总队，共达二十七万人之众。但经九昼夜的激战，终不能逃此惨败，而区寿年、沈澄年等高级将领且均被我生俘。这一辉煌胜利，正给蒋介石“肃清中原”的呓语以迎头痛击；同时，也更使我军有利地进入了中国人民解放战争的第三年度。当此盛暑，特向同志们致慰念之意。尚望继续努力，为歼灭更多蒋敌，解放全中原人民而战！
