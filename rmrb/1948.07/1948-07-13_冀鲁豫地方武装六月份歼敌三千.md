From the 9th to the 18th of last month, the militia in the Fourth District of Wenshang fought seven battles to protect grain, annihilating and capturing 22 enemies, including Cui Benzhe, the captain of the independent brigade of the Fourth Pacification Zone, and seizing 9 guns and 419 rounds of ammunition. On the 23rd of last month, over 200 local bandits from the Wenshang Brigade invaded the Shaheya area of our Fourth District to loot grain, but were ambushed and repelled by our local armed forces, killing 6 enemies. During the wheat harvest, the armed work team of the Changqing local armed forces went to the marginal areas to provide armed cover for the masses to rush to harvest and hide grain, repelling many enemy attempts to loot grain. The enemy Laiwu and Pingyin Brigades came to Sunzhuang and other places in Changqing and Dongping in late last month to loot grain, but were all defeated by us, and 6 enemies were killed or captured, 5 rifles were seized, and 5 large carts of wheat, totaling about 7,000 jin, were intercepted and handed over to the district to be distributed to the masses.
