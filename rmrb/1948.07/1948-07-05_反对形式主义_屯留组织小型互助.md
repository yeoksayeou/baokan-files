　　Oppose Formalism
　　Tunliu Organizes Small-Scale Mutual Aid
　　[Taiyue News] On June 19th, Tunliu Second District convened a meeting of labor heroes, production models, and experienced mutual aid team leaders to review and criticize the past formalism of large-scale, bustling mutual aid organizations, and proposed small-scale mutual aid methods. Twenty-eight people, including labor hero Gao Yunting, attended. The leadership first made a self-criticism, admitting that they had not properly guided and cultivated them in the past period of production, causing losses in production, and asked them to offer more opinions on the current production work. During the discussion, three problems were identified in the current production mutual aid that urgently needed to be resolved: (1) Large-scale mutual aid organizations sometimes not only fail to promote production but also cause some opposite results. Wei Yubin of Xipo Village said: "There are too many people in a group in the south ditch of our village. Last spring, fifteen people went to weed the fields, weeding one family after another. By the time they finished weeding one round, the weeds that were weeded first had grown back." Xu Goudan of the same village had a group of six or seven people who would divide into two or three plots to weed during busy times, weeding quickly and in a timely manner. After finishing their own fields, they also weeded more than ten mu for military families. Some teams have too many people, and everyone is anxious to weed their own land. When weeding for others, they become perfunctory, not weeding the weeds thoroughly and weeding too shallowly. It is also very time-consuming to record work points when there are too many people. The large team in Xu Village spent half a day calculating accounts every five days for twenty people, which adds up to eight or nine workdays. Some groups are too large, and the team leaders are too busy, causing too many mistakes and not being able to work themselves, so some people are unwilling to be team leaders. Production leadership then becomes unorganized. (2) Some groups force work exchanges, and work accounts are not clear. Last year, the Yuli Mutual Aid Brigade forced a disorderly harvest of wheat, making it impossible to record work points. The accounts have not been cleared from last year until now. The head of the Shangcun Mutual Aid Brigade forced women to till nine mu of land for a lazy man. Because of their weak labor, everyone was unwilling, so they dug carelessly, spending fifty-eight workdays and receiving one stone and seven dou of wages in rice. The lazy man was unwilling to pay, and the work accounts have not been cleared until now. These problems have not been well resolved. This year, when the leadership announced that mutual aid must be voluntary, some groups disbanded; some large mutual aid groups still exist in name but actually have three or five people exchanging work with each other; some are based on the old mutual aid groups but with some people leaving, and the old members are still working together; some are completely reorganized. Those who attended the meeting unanimously agreed that small-scale mutual aid is good, making it easier to solve issues such as voluntariness, recording work points, equivalent exchange, and leadership. It was decided at the meeting to universally organize small-scale mutual aid. Now, these two tasks will be done first: (1) Exchanging work with each other should not be too formal and not too large. People can work on their own during slack times and exchange work during busy times. This method can take care of everyone's scattered work such as watering gardens and planting melons, and can also flexibly continue mutual aid for a long time. If someone is sent away on errands, it will also be convenient for others to take care of their family's farming. (2) Reorganize existing mutual aid groups, clear old accounts, voluntarily combine, democratically elect team leaders, and everyone decides on wages.

### 反对形式主义　屯留组织小型互助

　　反对形式主义
    屯留组织小型互助
    【太岳讯】屯留二区在六月十九日召开劳动英雄、生产模范及有经验的互助组长会议，检查批判过去形式主义凑热闹的大队大组的互助形式，提出小型互助办法。到劳动英雄高云亭等二十八人。领导上首先作了检讨，承认在过去一段生产中没有好好领导培养他们，使生产受了损失，请他们对目前的生产工作多提意见。在讨论中，检查出目前生产互助中有三个问题亟待解决：（一）大队大组的互助组织，有时不但不能起推动生产的作用，反而会引起一些相反的结果。西泼村魏玉斌说：“俺村南沟的一组人太多了，去年春天十五个人去锄地，一家挨一家的锄，轮流锄完一遍时，先锄的草又长起来荒了”。该村许狗旦的一个组六、七个人，在紧活时就分开两三块锄，锄得又快又及时，锄完了自己的，还给军属锄了十几亩。有些组队人太多了，大家都急着想锄自己的地，给别人锄时就敷衍起来，草锄不尽，又锄得浅。人多了记工时也很误工，许村的大组五天一算帐，二十个人就得误半天功夫，合起来就是八九个工。有些组太大，组长太忙，误事太多，又不能顶工，有些人不愿当组长。生产领导就自流了。（二）有些组强迫变工，工帐算不清。峪里的互助大队，去年割麦强迫打乱割，就没法记工，去年到现在就没清帐。上村互助大队长强迫妇女给一个懒汉垡了九亩地，因为劳力弱，大家又不愿意，马马虎虎挖了一下，费了五十八个工，得一石七斗工资米。懒汉不愿意拿，工帐到现在也没弄清。这些问题一直没得到很好解决。在今年领导上宣布互助一定要自愿时，有的组就散伙了；有的大互助组形式上虽然还存在，实际是三个五个人互相拨工；有的是在旧互助组的基础上去了一些人，旧人还在一块劳动；有的是完全重新结合。到会者一致认为小型互助好，容易解决自愿、记工、等价及领导等等问题。会上决定普遍组织小型互助。现在先作这两个工作：（１）互相拨工不拘形式，不要太大，闲时可以各干各的，忙时互相拨工。这种办法能照顾每个人浇园、种瓜等零碎活，又能灵活的长期互助下去。有人支差走了，家里的活别人也便于照顾耕种。（２）整理旧有互助组，清理旧帐，自愿结合，民主选组长，大家决定工资。
