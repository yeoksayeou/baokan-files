Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 7th. Shen Gongliang, deputy platoon leader of a certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, has achieved outstanding results in uniting new soldiers and consolidating the troops. He was selected as a people's hero at the recent celebration meeting of the unit.

He served as a squad leader for more than a year. All the squads he led, some experienced fierce battles, and some were entirely composed of newly enlisted soldiers, but there were never any desertions.

Shen Gongliang's greatest characteristic in leading soldiers is his ability to understand the soldiers' psychology and to care for all his comrades from a true class feeling and a spirit of responsibility towards the revolution. He said, "Our soldiers are the treasures of the revolution and should all be cherished." When the squad was about to be supplemented with newly liberated soldiers, Shen Gongliang took the initiative to discuss with the Party's group leader how to unite and educate them. He said, "The new comrades do not know the nature of our revolutionary army, the Party must find ways to ensure patient education of the new comrades." Whenever he had time, he would convene group meetings to summarize the experience of consolidating the troops so that everyone could improve. He said to the old soldiers, "The new comrades will all become old comrades in the future. Consolidating one more means adding one more point of revolutionary strength." He asked the old soldiers to automatically come up with ideas to unite the new soldiers. After the new soldiers came to the squad, he immediately convened a unity meeting, first having the old soldiers introduce their history to guide the new soldiers to introduce themselves. Then, based on the history of the new soldiers, different education was carried out. For example, the liberated soldier Miao Shilu had been a soldier in the Kuomintang army for more than ten years. Shen Gongliang asked him, "What did the Kuomintang give you after ten years of being a soldier?" Miao said, "Empty hands." Then Shen Gongliang said, "You see, you served the Kuomintang for more than ten years, and you were still hungry; but the People's Liberation Army soldiers, everyone defeats Chiang Kai-shek, and everyone divides the land to live a good life." He then introduced the situation in the liberated areas to Miao in detail. Miao Shilu said excitedly, "Squad leader, don't worry, I am determined to work hard here and also be a good soldier of the People's Liberation Army." Liberated warrior Qi Bin was not used to eating millet and was in a bad mood. So the Party group discussed how to educate him, and then the deputy squad leader explained to him: "The People's Liberation Army is the people's army, we eat what the people eat. If the people's lives have not been improved, we cannot eat and drink randomly, we must share the joys and sorrows with the people." Qi Bin understood this principle and quickly got used to it.

Under Shen Gongliang's exemplary leadership, the old soldiers were also able to care for the new soldiers in all aspects, such as helping the new soldiers carry backpacks and guns during marches. The new soldier Lin Zeru wore out his shoes halfway. Shen Gongliang immediately took out the shoes he usually saved and gave them to him to wear. During the march, everyone educated the new soldiers anytime and anywhere. For example, when living in the landlord's house, they explained to the new soldiers how the landlord exploited the peasants without working; when passing through the Yellow River flooded area caused by Chiang's army breaching the dikes, they explained Chiang Kai-shek's crime of flooding the people with water.

When leading the newly enlisted soldiers, Shen Gongliang served as the education squad leader. He and the new soldier squad leader Ma Heshan were very united, did not put on airs, and discussed things with each other, so that Ma Heshan dared to take responsibility for doing things, and actively cultivated Ma Heshan's leadership ability. When the soldiers' families came to the army to visit the soldiers, he took care of them as if they were his own relatives. He said to the soldiers' relatives, "You are like our parents, and your children are like brothers to us here." Four returning soldiers from other squads were assigned to Shen Gongliang's squad. Shen Gongliang was very kind to them; he first held a welcome meeting, inspiring and consolidating the revolutionary self-esteem of the returning soldiers. Under the principle and confidence that "as long as they are educated, they can make progress," he transformed many soldiers and cultivated many backbones.

　　巩固部队模范
    副排长沈公良
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线七日电】华东解放军某部副排长沈公良，团结新战士和巩固部队成绩优异，在最近该部庆功大会上被选为人民英雄。
    他曾担任班长一年多，凡他所领导过的班，有的经历过激烈战斗，有的全班都是新参军战士，但从来都没有发生过逃亡现象。
    沈公良领导战士的最大特点，是能熟悉战士心理，并从真正阶级感情与对革命负责的精神出发去爱护全班同志。他说：“我们的战士是革命的宝贝，都应该爱护”。当班里要补充新解放战士时，沈公良就主动和党的小组长商量怎样团结教育他们，他说：“新同志不知道我们革命军队性质，党内要想办法保证对新同志耐心的教育”。有空他就召开小组会，总结巩固部队经验，使大家都能提高一步。他对老战士说：“新同志将来也都是老同志，多巩固一个，就多增加一分革命力量。”他要求老战士自动出主意团结新战士。新战士来班里后，他即召开团结会，先由老战士介绍自己历史，引导新战士作自我介绍。于是根据新战士历史，进行不同的教育。例如解放战士苗世禄，在国民党军里当了十多年兵，沈公良就问他道：“你当兵十年，国民党给了你什么？”苗说：“一只空手。”于是沈公良就说：“你看，你替国民党当兵十多年，还是要饿肚子；可是解放军战士，大家打垮蒋介石，大家分田地过好日子。”他随即把解放区的情形一一向苗介绍。苗世禄激动的说：“班长放心，我决心在这里好好干，也做解放军的一个好战士。”解放战争齐滨因不习惯吃小米饭，情绪不好。于是党的小组就讨论如何教育他，然后由副班长向他讲解：“人民解放军是人民的队伍，老百姓吃什么我们也吃什么。老百姓生活没有得到改善，我们就不能随意乱吃乱喝，要与人民共甘苦。”齐滨懂得了这个道理，从此就很快习惯起来了。
    在沈公良以身作则推动下，老战士也都能从各方面关心新战士，如行军时帮新战士背背包、扛枪。新战士林泽如中途穿破了鞋子。沈公良马上把自己日常节余下的鞋子拿给他穿。行军中大家都随时随地向新战士进行教育。如住在地主家就向新战士讲解地主如何不劳动而剥削农民；行经蒋军决堤之黄泛区，就讲解蒋介石决堤水淹人民的罪行。
    带领新参军战士时，沈公良任教育班长。他和新兵班长马合山非常团结，不摆老资格，有事互相商量，使马合山敢于负责做事，并积极培养了马合山的领导能力。战士家属到部队来看望战士时，他照顾得象自己亲人一样。他对战士亲属说：“你们就犹如咱的父母，你儿在这里和我们也象兄弟一样”。别班的四个归队战士编到了沈公良班上，沈公良对他们很和蔼；他先召开了个欢迎会，启发和巩固了归队战士的革命自尊心。在“只要教育都能进步”的方针和信心下，他改造了很多战士，培养了很多骨干。
