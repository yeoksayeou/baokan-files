The jujube-producing areas of Qingfeng and Neihuang in the Jilu Yu region have recently experienced a large infestation of "Shehong" insects (commonly known as "Eight Corners") on jujube trees, causing significant damage. Chang Liu and other comrades from the Construction Section of the No. 8 Special District Administration have researched and introduced the following methods for eliminating the insects:

(1) Mix ten liang of quicklime and four liang of tobacco powder. First, add three jin of water and soak for half a day. Then, remove the residue and add another fifty jin of clean water to spray on the trees.

(2) Mix four liang of lime with two jin of water to make lime water. Then, add four liang of sulfur and simmer over a fire for about an hour until it turns yellowish-brown. Remove the residue and add two hundred jin of water to spray on the trees. Note that a steel pot should not be used for simmering. Stir constantly while simmering to prevent sedimentation.

(3) There is a kind of herbal medicine, commonly known as Baibuzi. Crush its tubers, mix with water, and spray on the trees.

(4) Pile soil more than one chi high around the base of the tree, and use an iron hoe to smooth it, making it as steep as possible. Before dawn, while the insects are weakened from the overnight dew and their adhesion is poor, use a large wooden stick to knock on the roots of the tree. The insects will be shaken off, and then killed. For those that are not completely removed, they will be unable to climb back up the tree due to the smooth soil pile around the roots.

The above methods have all been successfully tested.

　　冀鲁豫八专署介绍杀枣树虫法
    冀鲁豫区清丰、内黄一带产枣区，近来枣树上多生“射虹”虫（俗名“八角”），对枣树为害很大。八专署建设科常流等同志经过研究，介绍了除虫办法如下：（一）用十两生石灰、四两烟粉混在一起，先加水三斤，泡半天以后，取出渣子，再加净水五十斤，喷在树上。（二）用石灰四两，加水二斤，制成石灰水，再加硫磺四两，用火熬一小时许，等成黄土色时，取出渣子，加水二百斤喷射树上，但注意熬时不要用钢锅，随熬随搅，不要使之沉淀。（三）有一种草药，俗名白埠子，将它的块根弄碎，用水调和，喷在树上。（四）围着树根堆一尺多高的土，用铁铣拍光，越陡越好，天明以前，趁虫子受一夜露水打，伸缩和胶涩力不强的时候，用大木棍敲打树根，虫子便可震下，然后打死，打不净的，因树根有光土堆，它也无力再爬上树去。以上几种方法都是经过试验成功的。
