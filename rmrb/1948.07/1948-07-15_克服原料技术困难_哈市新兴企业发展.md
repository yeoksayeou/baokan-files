Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 11th:

　　The emerging state-owned enterprises in Harbin, such as the gas (coal gas), rubber shoe, wire, and chemical bowl (bakelite bowl) factories, have overcome difficulties in raw materials and technology over the past six months and have established a preliminary scale. The experimental factory, which was converted from the former puppet Manchurian gas factory, resumed operations in July last year. Currently, the number of employees has increased nearly sevenfold compared to the start of operations, and gas production has increased by a quarter compared to the puppet Manchurian period. The scope of gas transmission and the number of factory and civilian users are also increasing daily. The factory has also added chemical and machinery departments, and plans to establish five fractionation departments in the gas partial distillation plant. The first fractionation department has already begun to extract heavy oil, light oil, medium oil, and asphalt from the gas by-product coal tar. The remaining four fractionation departments are being actively installed and are expected to start operations in September. The chemical department was established this spring and can now produce large quantities of raw materials for sulfur dyes every month. The machinery department was established in September last year and created a mining drill, which has been adopted by various departments. In the past, Harbin's rubber products were all supplied by South Manchuria. Over the past two years, through continuous construction and improvement, the rubber industry has been able to produce large quantities of rubber shoes. The cost has gradually decreased compared to the initial stage. In January last year, Rubber Shoe Factory No. 1 required 3.5 square feet of cloth per pair of shoes, but now only requires 2.95 square feet, and the quality has also improved. Since the rubber shoe factory affiliated to the Chemical Industry Cooperative started manufacturing rubber shoe soles in April this year, the daily output has increased fourfold compared to the initial stage. Technicians Tong Duofu, Jiang Shijiang, and others have also researched and successfully trial-produced regenerated rubber materials using the alkali method, which can be produced in large quantities soon. In addition, the wire factory and chemical bowl factory have also been producing large quantities of products since they started operations half a year ago, supplying military and civilian needs.

　　克服原料技术困难
    哈市新兴企业发展
    【新华社东北十一日电】哈尔滨市新兴的瓦斯（煤气）、胶皮鞋、电线、及化学碗（电木碗）制造厂等公营企业，半年来克服原料和技术上的困难，已建立初步规模，由原伪满瓦斯工厂改成的实验工厂，去年七月复工后，目前职工已较开工时增加近七倍，瓦斯产量较伪满时期增加四分之一。瓦斯输送范围与工厂市民用户也逐日增加。该厂并增设化学、机器两部，另在瓦斯部分馏厂计划设立五个分馏部。第一分馏部已开始从瓦斯副产品煤焦油中提炼重油、轻油、中油、沥青等。其余四个分馏部正在积极装置，九月间即可开工。化学部于今春成立，现每月可出产大量硫化染料原料。机器部于去年九月成立，曾创制采矿钻，已为各部采用。哈市过去胶皮产品皆由南满供给。两年来胶皮工业，经过不断的建设和改进，已可制出大批胶皮鞋，成本较初创时逐渐减低，胶鞋一厂去年一月每双鞋需布三点五方尺，现仅需二点九五方尺，质量亦较前提高。化学工业社所属胶鞋厂自今年四月开工制造胶皮鞋掌以来，日产量较初期已增加四倍。该厂技师佟多福、姜世骧等并研究以碱法自制更生胶皮料子，已试制成功，即可大量制造。此外，电线工厂、化学碗制造厂自半年前开工以来，亦已大量出品，供给军需民用。
