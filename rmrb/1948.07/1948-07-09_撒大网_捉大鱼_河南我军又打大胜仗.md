Casting a Wide Net to Catch Big Fish

Henan Our Army Wins Another Great Victory

In the battle of Kaifeng, the People's Liberation Army eliminated more than 40,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Following that, they cast a wide net south of Kaifeng, surrounding a corps of Chiang Kai-shek's army. They have already completely annihilated the reorganized 75th Division and the New 21st Brigade of this corps, and captured a corps commander surnamed Qu and a division commander surnamed Shen. Seeing the situation was not good, Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly transferred another corps from Shandong, but as soon as they arrived southeast of Kaifeng, they were intercepted by our Liberation Army and tightly surrounded piece by piece, causing heavy casualties. Among them, the reorganized 72nd Division has been surrounded for more than ten days, running out of ammunition and food. If they do not come over to our people's side, they will also be finished.

　　撒大网·捉大鱼
    河南我军又打大胜仗
    开封那一仗，人民解放军总共消灭了蒋介石军队四万多人，接着在开封以南又撒开了大网，包围住了蒋介石的一个兵团，已经把这个兵团的整编七十五师和新编二十一旅全部歼灭，把一个姓区的兵团长和一个姓沈的师长都捉住了。蒋介石一看大势不好，慌忙又把另外一个兵团从山东调过来，但刚到了开封东南，就也叫咱解放军截住，分成一块一块紧紧包围起来，又叫咱打死打伤不少。其中有个整编七十二师，也叫咱包围着已经十来天，没子弹了，也没粮食吃了，如果他们不投到咱人民方面来，跟着就也要完蛋。
