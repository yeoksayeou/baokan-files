[Ji Lu Yu Telegraph] On July 4th, when this reporter arrived two li away from the Kunshan Yellow River perilous project, I could see from afar on the top of the perilous project's embankment and the top of the dam many tall, orderly, and square things resembling tile-roofed houses. Those were the straw material piles and stone material piles that the masses of Kunshan, Dongping, and Nanwang had transported to repair the dam and bank revetment. The encircled embankments in that area were even more densely packed with stone piles, resembling a stone city in the mountains.

These stones for repairing the perilous project were transported during every war-time lull after safely weathering last year's flood season. Last winter, 2,200 cubic meters of stone were transported, and before this year's wheat harvest, the enormous achievement of 4,910 cubic meters of stone was completed. After the wheat harvest, because the major flood season was approaching, Kunshan County concentrated all its efforts, with the responsible comrades of the county and district personally participating in the leadership. In the scorching heat, they completed 4,000 cubic meters of stone in a seven-day blitz, totaling 11,770 cubic meters of stone.

The Kunshan perilous project starts from Lujiakou, passes through Hongchang, Jinnali, Guonali, Sunlou, Shiya, Qianxinzhuang, and Houxinzhuang, and ends at Shilipu, with a total length of nearly sixteen li, or 7,820 meters. It originally had forty-four dams. Based on the needs of the water flow, two new dams were added to the encircling embankment at Guonali last year, and this year four new dams were added between the tenth and fourteenth dams. White fish-scale dams are also being added at Guonali. When I arrived at the perilous project, the seventy-odd members of the Kunshan engineering team and the three shifts of the engineering team transferred from the Shounan flood control section were leading 350 laborers, regardless of the scorching sun, and were intensely battling the Yellow River. On each dam, they were busy carrying sorghum stalks, carrying stones, lifting stones, carrying earth, carrying willow branches, driving piles, and pulling ropes. They were shouting, challenging each other, and encouraging each other to do more.

On the new thirteenth dam, eight strong engineering team members were using rammers to tamp the foundation of the flood control house. Each of them was pulling on a rammer rope. The eighty-odd jin stone rammer, in the midst of the majestic and resonant rammer song, was frequently thrown about one zhang high, and then heavily slammed to the ground, venting their hatred for the Chiang bandits! Building the Great Wall on the banks of the Yellow River.

　　黄河岸上的长城
    君谦
    【冀鲁豫电】七月四日，记者行抵距昆山黄河险工二里远的时候，遥望险工堤顶上和坝顶上，有许多高大、整齐、方正象瓦屋形的东西。那便是昆山、东平和南旺群众运来修坝埽用的秸料垛和石料垛，国那里一带的圈堤上，更是石垛密集，俨如山区的一座石城。
    这些修险的石料，是在安然渡过了去年的大汛期后，抓紧一切战争空隙赶运的。去年冬，运了二二○○方石，今年麦收前，又完成了四九一○方石的巨大成绩。麦收后因为大汛期迫近，昆山县就集中一切力量，县区负责同志都亲身参加领导，在酷热的天气里，以七天的突击，完成了四○○○方石，合计为一一七七○方石。
    昆山险工从路家口起，经过红厂、靳那里、国那里、孙楼、石崖、前辛庄、后辛庄等七个庄，止于十里铺，全长近十六华里，七千八百二十公尺，原有四十四道坝，根据水势的需要，去年在国那里圈堤，又加修了两道新坝，今年又在第十道至十四坝之间，加修新坝四道，还正在国那里，加修白鱼鳞坝。当我到该险工时，昆山的七十余名工程队和从寿南修防段调来助工的三班工程队，正领导着三百五十名民工，不顾炎烈太阳的曝晒，紧张的在和黄河搏斗着，各坝上忙着扛秫秸、扛石、抬石、挑土、扛柳枝、打桩、拉绳等工程。他们呼着，互相挑战，互相鼓励着多干。
    在新十三坝上，八名精壮的工程队员，在用硪打防汛屋的墙基，他们每人扯着一条硪辫子，八十余斤的石硪，在雄壮浑厚的硪歌声中，频频的被甩到一丈左右高，又重重的砸在地上，吐泄对蒋匪的仇恨！修筑着黄河岸上的长城。
