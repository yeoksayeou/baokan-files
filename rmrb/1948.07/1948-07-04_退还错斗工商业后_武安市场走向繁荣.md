　　After Returning Wrongfully Confiscated Industry and Commerce
    Wu'an Market Moves Towards Prosperity
    [Taihang News] Wu'an resolutely implements the Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce, corrects past leftist errors, and returns and compensates wrongfully confiscated industry and commerce. The market has begun to prosper, and many businesses are actively developing their operations. Some stores that were previously empty are now stocked with new goods. Many stores are recruiting new staff, painting their storefronts, and renovating their buildings. Merchants who had fled are also returning one after another, actively planning to resume their businesses. After the liberation of Wu'an County, there were a total of 1,272 industrial and commercial businesses and vendors in the town (including 267 seated merchants, 823 vendors, 97 workshops, 84 handicraft businesses, 6 factories, and 92 others). Through the joint urban-rural struggle from the winter of 1945 to the spring of 1946, over 130 larger industrial and commercial businesses were excessively struggled against (valued at a total of 130 million Jiao banknotes at the then market price). More than 3,000 townspeople faced difficulties in making a living due to the market downturn. Industrial and commercial businesses that had not been infringed upon also harbored fears of being "cut down like韭菜 (chives, a metaphor for repeated exploitation)," adopting an attitude of maintaining the status quo and not developing further. In order to implement the Party's policy on industry and commerce, the Wu'an County government, under the personal leadership of County Chief Zhang, began to return and compensate infringed industrial and commercial businesses in mid-April. Over two months, 85 businesses have been returned (50 seated merchants, 28 workshops and small vendors, and 1 factory), amounting to 117.87 million Jiao banknotes. The remaining 50 businesses are also settling accounts and handling return procedures. In terms of return methods, businesses where "the god is changed but not the temple" (i.e., the store or factory still exists, but the shareholders have changed) are returned the original amount; for those that were divided among the masses, low-interest loans from the bank and compensation from the fruits of the poor people's association are used to enable them to continue operating. The actual return compensation, combined with the publicity of the Party's policy on industry and commerce, gradually dispelled the doubts and misconceptions about our policies that citizens and store owners had developed due to past leftist errors. All 85 industrial and commercial businesses that have been returned have restored their original names, refreshed their storefronts, purchased new goods, and opened one after another. Merchants who had fled to various places have also returned one after another, actively resuming their businesses. In the last two months alone, 11 households have returned to Sanjie Street. Bai Yinzhou, the manager of the Huafengtai Pharmacy, returned immediately from Tianjin upon hearing that Wu'an was returning industry and commerce. The market has become active, business has expanded, and all stores are adding staff. According to a survey of 30 seated merchants such as Yuanhexin and Tongmao, 44 new employees have been added. Under the influence of the return of industry and commerce, industrial and commercial families that were not struggled against are actively developing upwards, purchasing new goods one after another. For example, Li Qinglan of Fuqingheng Felt Workshop closed his business and returned to his hometown of Xiyang last year for fear of struggle, but recently returned to open his business again. Wanshunheng Grain Store did not dare to develop in the past, but this year has taken out several loans from the bank, each time over 1 million. Merchants said: "The conditions for doing business are now very convenient. First, no road passes are required; second, if funds are lacking, we can get loans from the government. As long as the business is done right, it is easy to make money." The county government recently held a symposium with industrial and commercial capitalists to help them study how to develop industry and commerce and prosper the market in the future.

　　退还错斗工商业后
    武安市场走向繁荣
    【太行讯】武安坚决执行党的保护工商业政策，纠正过去左倾错误，退还与补偿了错斗工商业，市场开始走上繁荣，许多商号在积极发展营业。有些商店过去货架是空的，这时出现了新的货物，不少商店在招收新的人员，刷漆门面，修整市房。逃亡在外的商人也纷纷归来，积极筹划复业。该县城关解放后，共有一千二百七十二家工商业和摊贩（内坐商二百六十七家，摊贩八百二十三家，作坊九十七家，手工业八十四家，工厂六家，其他九十二家）。经过一九四五年冬至一九四六年春的城乡联合斗争，先后过左的斗争了较大工商业一百卅多家（按当时的市价折合，共值冀钞（下同）一万万三千万元）。全城有三千多市民因市场萧条，谋生感到困难。未被侵犯的工商业也都存在怕“割韭菜”思想，抱着只维持现状不发展的态度。武安县府为执行党的工商业政策，在张县长亲自参加领导下，于四月中开始退还补偿被侵犯的工商业，经过两个月时间，已经退还了八十五家（坐商五十家，作坊小商贩二十八家，工厂一家），折合一万万一千七百八十七万。下余的五十家也清算帐目，办理退还手续。在退还办法上，换神不换庙者（即商店或工厂还在，股东易人）原数退还；群众分了的，由银行低利贷款和从贫民会的果实中补偿，使能继续营业。实际的退还补偿和宣传党的工商业政策相结合，使市民及商店主由过去过左的错误做法所产生对我政策的怀疑与错觉，逐渐消除。已退还的八十五家工商业，均已恢复原来字号，刷新门面，添购货物，先后开张。逃亡各地的商人也纷纷归来，积极复业，光三街在最近两月中就回来十一户。华丰泰药行掌柜白银周，听说武安退还工商业，立即从天津返来。市场活跃了，营业扩大了，各商店均在添增人员。据元和新、同茂号等三十家坐商调查，新添人员达四十四名。未被斗争的工商业家在退还工商业的影响下，积极向上发展，纷纷采办新货。如复庆恒毡坊李庆兰，去年怕斗争，关门回了原籍昔阳，最近又回来开门营业；万顺恒粮店过去不敢发展，今年从银行贷款数次，每次一百余万。商人们说：“现在做买卖条件很便利，第一不开路条，第二资金缺少能从政府贷款，只要买卖作对了，睁钱很容易”。县府最近又召开了工商业资本家座谈会，帮助他们研究今后如何发展工商业，繁荣市场。
