　　Yu-Wan-Su Democratic Government
    Shelters Kaifeng Citizens Bombed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Wan Yu Su, 1st dispatch] When Chiang's planes frantically bombed the city of Kaifeng, citizens fled the city to the countryside to take shelter. The democratic governments of the counties surrounding Kaifeng have specially established reception stations to accommodate them. In addition to providing food and lodging, each reception station is equipped with temporary clinics to treat citizens injured by Chiang's planes. The Zhuxian Town reception station alone accommodated more than 400 Kaifeng citizens in just two days, the 19th and 20th. Peng, the Deputy Commissioner of the Fifth Administrative Office of our Yu-Wan-Su Liberated Area, personally went to the station to comfort them. Among the sheltered citizens were more than 50 students from Henan University. Their faces were covered with dust, and some were only wearing shorts because they had left in a hurry. When the head of our reception station shook hands with them one by one and offered condolences, they burst into tears. A student named Zhang said excitedly: "We are not crying, but repenting. In the past, I was deceived and did not understand the liberated areas. Today, I understand what is called enthusiasm and truth."

　　豫皖苏民主政府
    收容开封被炸市民
    【新华社皖豫苏一日电】当蒋机狂炸开封城时，市民纷纷离城下乡躲避，开封周围各县民主政府已特设立招待站予于收容。各招待站除照顾膳宿外，并设有临时诊疗所，救治遭蒋机炸伤的市民。朱仙镇招待站仅十九、二十两天内即收容了开封市民四百余人。我豫皖苏解放区五专署彭副专员特亲赴该站安抚。收容的市民中并有河南大学学生五十余人。他们都满脸尘土，有的因仓皇出走只穿着一条短裤。当我招待站站长一一和他们握手并予慰问时，他们都顿时热泪夺眶而出。一位姓张的学生激动的说：“我们不是哭。而是忏悔。过去我是受欺骗了，不了解解放区。今天我才懂得了什么叫热情和真理。”
