Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Reports from various sources indicate that the employee strike, which began on the 8th of this month in the financial departments of the French government, had surged to 1.5 million people by the 13th. This strike shows a continuing trend of expansion, with communist union leaders issuing a call on the same day "to other employees, including all government departments, to participate in the strike movement" (Associated Press). The striking factions include the General Confederation of Labor led by the Communist Party, the "Workers' Force" led by the Socialist Party, and the unions affiliated with the Christian Workers' League. "The strike has cut off all air transport in France, strangled the government's finances, closed the courts in Paris, suspended the national lottery, and threatens to paralyze traffic" (Associated Press). The strike has also "affected the Ministries of Interior, Justice, Public Health, and Veterans Affairs, as well as employees in all counties and districts throughout France" (Associated Press). When the strike began, it was limited to the Ministry of Finance, banks, and tax authorities, but subsequently expanded to other administrative departments. On the 10th, employees of the Ministry of Economy and the Central Administration of National Construction went on strike. That evening, customs officials also went on strike, initially partially, and then completely. After meteorological and telecommunications employees at airports began striking on the evening of the 11th, "air transport between Paris and other European cities was almost completely cut off" (Associated Press). The next day, the Ministry of National Economy and central administrative departments also joined the strike. By the evening of the 13th, after employees in all county governments and the Ministries of Interior and Justice throughout France joined the strike, the number of striking employees surged to 1.5 million. The striking employees unanimously demanded higher pay grades and increased salaries to maintain the necessary standard of living.
