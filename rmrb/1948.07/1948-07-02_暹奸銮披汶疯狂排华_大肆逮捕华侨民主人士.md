Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th -- Hong Kong News: The Siamese fascist war criminal Luang Phibunsongkhram government continues to implement its frantic anti-Chinese tyranny. Following the reactionary measures in May of closing Chinese schools and forcibly reducing the number of overseas Chinese schools, the Bangkok police authorities illegally searched legally established schools run by overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese democratic organizations on the 12th of this month. With the cooperation of Kuomintang secret service organs, they arrested 41 overseas Chinese compatriots, including 23 teachers and staff from Nanyang Middle School and 18 democrats from organizations such as the Overseas Chinese National Construction and Homeland Salvation Association, the Education Association, and the Federation of Trade Unions. Except for two people who were released, the rest will be tried by the "Criminal Court." The police later revealed that this large-scale search and arrest, under the pretext of cracking down on "secret societies disturbing public order," will continue to expand nationwide. It is reported that 300 more overseas Chinese democrats have been placed on a blacklist. In addition, Luang Phibunsongkhram's Ministry of Interior intends to impose fabricated charges on overseas Chinese democrats, thereby deporting them en masse. It is said that this "gesture" is to "win the favor of democratic countries (referring to imperialist countries such as the United States)," and is "an action by the Luang Phibunsongkhram government to gain the confidence of the United States before the meeting of U.S. State Department officials from Asia and the Far East region in Bangkok next week."
