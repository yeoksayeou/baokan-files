　　南共留苏党员抗议铁托政策
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：此间各报刊载南斯拉夫留苏学生致贝尔格莱德南共中央委员会的声明，原文如下：我们——斯大林学院工程系的学生，对南共中央委员会及南斯拉夫政府对苏联和布尔塞维克党以及其他兄弟党所奉行的仇视政策，表示坚决的抗议。作为南斯拉夫共产党的党员，我们要求南共中央委员会诚恳地接受情报局决议中指出的错误，并改正这些错误，使我们的党回到其他共产党的兄弟联盟中来。没有苏联，没有布尔塞维克党和斯大林同志，建设社会主义和南斯拉夫的自由就没有可能。拉斯波波维区少校、米海伊洛维区中尉、柯斯上尉、柯瓦雪维区中尉、萨维区上尉、罗干诺维区上尉签名。一九四八年七月十七日于莫斯科。
