　　When the reporter entered the delegation's dormitory, he first met the famous labor hero Zhao Zhankui. He is now over fifty years old, but still as determined and strong as ever. In the liberated areas within the passes, his model deeds are known to all workers. Now he is the chairman of the trade union of a state-owned factory. After the Jiang bandit claws reached Yan'an last March, he and the entire staff transferred their factory several times, insisting on working in extremely difficult war conditions. Sometimes some workers armed themselves to cover other workers to carry out their work, and they were still able to exceed the original production tasks. When talking about the experience of coming to Harbin this time, he said excitedly: "Our world has grown big! The people's world has grown big! This time we traveled tens of thousands of miles, all in our liberated areas, and everywhere there were people welcoming us. Especially seeing the vast industrial construction and the strong and organized worker brothers in the Northeast Liberated Area, I am really extremely happy! This is the great victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao!"
    Secondly, the reporter met Zhang Qiufeng. He is a foundry worker who was in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and is a well-known special-class labor hero in Jin-Sui. Whether in the past or now, he has been able to unite the workers well and overcome all difficulties in material conditions to carry out production. When he mentioned the arduous struggle of the workers and environment in the Northwest, he said: "The workers in the Northwest are not only working hard to produce and support the war, but also constantly fighting against the荒旱 [huang han - drought]. This year, the workers have generally used their spare time to reclaim wasteland for farming. The factory where I am alone has planted eighty 垧 [qing - about 666 square meters] of land." When he talked about the rapid recovery of industry and the rapid development of new construction in the Northeast, and the continuous increase in workers' enthusiasm for production, he showed an indescribable excitement and joy, and from time to time revealed the smile of a victor, saying: "This is the result of Chairman Mao's leadership and the efforts of the laboring brothers."
    Yang Wanhong and Geng Xilin, labor representatives from Jin-Cha-Ji, said when talking about their impressions of entering the Northeast Liberated Area: "As soon as we entered the Northeast Liberated Area, we felt that the workers in the Northeast were organized, and all factories and railways seemed to be organized, planned, and orderly. For example, the train we took departed and arrived on time, not a minute late. Trade union organizations are very common, and staff and intellectuals also participate in trade unions. The workers are very enthusiastic about learning. They have well-written wall newspapers, perfect workers' clubs, and regular production exhibitions. Every activity shows the continuous progress of the workers in technology and politics. In the factory, we can see workers working hard everywhere. In a factory in a certain place, we saw a No. 2 machine whirring. A worker told us: "The Americans thought it couldn't be repaired, but after passing through our hands, it's running now." The improvement of the political consciousness of the workers in the Northeast is also reflected in the merit-making campaign and the model worker campaign. Everyone has formulated a strict plan for increasing production and making meritorious deeds, and everyone expresses extreme respect for labor heroes, which moves us very much. In a certain place, when the workers heard that Zhao Zhankui had arrived, they all surrounded him, and teenage female workers came forward to shake his hand. Everywhere we go, many worker brothers come to warmly welcome us, waving and cheering, fully demonstrating the friendship and unity of the working class."
    Zhang Fulin, the 48-year-old head of the East China Workers' Delegation, is a miner from Zaozhuang for more than 20 years, and is now the deputy director of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the director of the Lunan Federation of Trade Unions. With a tall stature and a dark face, he is a typical Shandong hero. He talked to reporters about the heroic deeds of the workers in the area during the long and cruel struggle in Zaozhuang in which the enemy and us entered and exited three times, from dismantling railways, destroying layers of power grids, and leading the way for our army, to organizing a workers' picket team of ×××× people to suppress special agents, protect mines, and cooperate with the main force to pursue and suppress bandit puppet Wang Jimei, and so on. Xie Haorong, a representative from Central China, in recalling the glorious achievements of General Su Yu's troops in winning seven battles and seven victories, described the heroic deeds of the Rugao Workers' Picket Team in bravely defending the people of Rugao after the main force withdrew. When the topic turned to the impressions of the Northeast Liberated Area, the representatives from East China all praised the rapid development of industry in the Northeast Liberated Area. For example, when the army entered a textile factory in a certain place, there were only 15,000 broken spindles. Three months later, not only were they all repaired, but the number was increased to 20,000 spindles. The representatives unanimously expressed their admiration for the railway employees' hundredfold efforts to repair railway bridges and their working spirit of not even taking a holiday during the Lunar New Year.

　　人民的天下大了
    访问关内职工代表团
    记者走进代表团宿舍的时候，首先会见了著名的劳动英雄赵占魁。他现在已经五十多岁了，但是还是那样的坚毅和强壮。在关内解放区，他的模范事迹职工们是人人皆知的。现在他是一个公营工厂的工会主任。在去年三月蒋匪魔瓜伸入延安后，他和全体职工会将他们的工厂数度转移，在极端困难的战争环境下坚持工作，有时部分工友武装起来，掩护另一部分工友进行工作，仍然能超过原定的生产任务。在谈到这次来哈的经过，他兴奋的说：“咱们的天下大了！人民的天下大了！这次我们走了万把里路，全是咱解放区，到处都有欢迎咱们的人，尤其是看到东北解放区广大的工业建设和强大而有组织的工人兄弟队伍，真高兴极了！这就是毛主席领导下中国人民伟大的胜利啊！”
    其次，记者会见了张秋凤。他是个翻砂工人，抗日战争时期就在晋绥解放区，是晋绥有名的特等劳动英雄。无论过去和现在，他都能很好的团结工人和克服一切物质条件的困难而进行生产。他在提到西北工人和环境作艰苦斗争时说：“西北工人一方面紧张生产支援战争，一方面还在和荒旱作不断的斗争。工友们在今年普遍的利用工余开荒种地，单是我所在的那个工厂就种了八十垧地。”当他谈到东北工业的迅速恢复和新建设的迅速开展，以及工人生产热情不断提高的时候，呈现着一种说不出的兴奋和愉快，不时的露出胜利者的微笑说：“这是毛主席的领导和劳动弟兄们努力的结果。”
    晋察冀的代表劳动英雄杨万宏、耿希林等在谈进入东北解放区的印象时说：“一进入东北解放区，就感觉到东北的工友是组织起来了，一切工厂和铁路都显得有组织，有计划，有秩序。比如我们坐的火车，准时开出，准时到达，一分也不差。工会组织很普遍，职员知识分子也都参加了工会。工友们学习情绪很高，他们有内容充实的壁报，完善的工人俱乐部，定时的生产品展览，每样活动都说明了工人在技术和政治上的不断进步，在工厂里，到处可以看到工人们在那儿起劲生产。我们在某地一个工厂里，看到一架二号机在哗哗的开动着，一个工友告诉我们：“这是美国人都认为修不好的，可是经过了我们的手，现在它动起来了。”东北工人政治觉悟的提高，还表现在立功运动和劳模运动上。每个人都订了严密的增产立功计划，每个人都对劳动英雄表示着极端的敬爱，这使我们很感动。在某地，工友们听说赵占魁来了，都围了上去，十几岁的小女工们都上前握手。我们每到一处，都有许多的工人弟兄们来热烈的欢迎我们，向我们招手欢呼，充分表现了工人阶级的友爱和团结。”
    四十八岁的华东职工代表团团长张福林，是枣庄二十多年的矿工，现在是山东省工会的副主任兼鲁南工会主任。魁梧的身材，黝黑的面孔，真是典型的山东健儿。他跟记者畅谈了敌我在枣庄三进三出长期残酷斗争中该区工人的英勇事迹，从拆铁路，破坏层层电网，替我军带路，到组织拥有××××名的工人纠察队，镇压特务，保护矿井，配合主力追剿匪伪王继美等等。华中代表谢浩荣在追述粟裕将军部队七战七捷的光荣战绩中，描绘了如皋工人纠察队在主力撤离后英勇捍卫如皋人民的英勇事迹。当话题转到对东北解放区的观感时，华东的代表们都盛赞东北解放区工业的迅速开展。如某地纺织厂在军进驻时，只有一万五千破烂锭子，三个月后，不仅全部修复，且增加到两万个锭子。代表们对于铁路员工百倍努力的抢修铁路桥梁，连旧历年假都不休息的工作精神，一致表示钦佩。
