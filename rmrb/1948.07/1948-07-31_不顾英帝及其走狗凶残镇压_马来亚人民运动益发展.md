　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Delhi, 9th: Indian newspapers publish details of the Malayan people's uprising. The core of the insurgents is composed of the Malayan People's Army guerrillas, who formerly fought against the Japanese aggressors for the freedom of Malaya. The Hindustan Times writes that the causes of the uprising include: corruption of the administrative authorities, shortage of consumer goods, persecution of workers who participated in the anti-Japanese movement during the war, etc. The "government reform" implemented in February 1948 restored the rights of the feudal princes, which was opposed by Chinese and Malayan merchants, and this opposition was supported by democratic parties and democratic groups. Low wages (especially in industry and mining) and high living expenses have further deteriorated the political situation in Malaya. The political influence of the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions in Malaya has been increasing. Despite the police ban, mass demonstrations were held in Singapore on May 1, and the people's uprising began in mid-May. "The Statesman" reported on July 8 that the Malayan authorities are brutally suppressing the people's uprising. The Pakistan Times reported that the British Navy and Air Force are also fighting against the rebels. In the past three weeks, more than a thousand people have been arrested.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, London, 9th: The British Communist Party's organ, the "Daily Worker," strongly condemned MacDonald, the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, for threatening participants in the Malayan liberation movement in a broadcast. The "Daily Worker" wrote that MacDonald and the rubber planters he represents are calling their political enemies—all those who criticize the dictatorship and colonial regime, all those who organize themselves in trade unions and dare to strike for higher wages—"terrorists." The Malayan people are fighting for democracy, trade union rights, and a decent standard of living. It is the Malayan rubber planters who are turning Malaya into a police state and implementing a reign of terror.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Moscow, 17th: News reports commenting on the situation in Malaya stated that a broad people's movement is developing in Malaya, and the myth spread by the British press about "foreign communists" is only used to divert people's attention from the exploitation of the colonial regime. The cause of the people's uprising should be found in the British colonial policy, which has squeezed the Malayan residents into poverty, without legal protection, and into slave labor in rubber plantations and tin mines. During the Japanese occupation, the British nonchalantly promised the Malayan people autonomy; but countless promises have so far been empty talk. What is worse is that British monopoly capitalists, faced with the American war situation, are further suppressing the wages of the already miserable Malayan workers, thereby sacrificing the interests of the Malayan working people to make up for the loss of their profits. The actions of the British authorities have once again convinced the colonial people that the situation of poverty and lack of rights cannot be eliminated without a struggle for national independence. This struggle is part of the democratic countries' movement for peace and international security, while the unlimited greed of capitalist monopoly giants is threatening peace and international security.

　　不顾英帝及其走狗凶残镇压
  　马来亚人民运动益发展
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社德里九日讯：印度报纸刊载马来亚人民起义的详情。起义者的核心，是由昔日为争取马来亚自由而抗击日本侵略者的马来亚人民军游击队所组成。印度斯坦时报写道，起义的原因包括：行政当局的腐化、消费品的奇缺、对战争时期参加抗日运动的工人之迫害等等。一九四八年二月所施行的“政府改革”，又恢复了封建王公的权利，这种改革为华籍及马来亚籍商人所反对，这种反对得到民主政党及民主团体的支持。工资低微（特别是在工矿业中）而生活费用高涨，使马来亚的政治情势更趋恶化。新加坡工会联合会在马来亚的政治影响已日益增大。尽管警察加以禁止，群众示威仍于五月一日在新加坡举行，而人民起义则在五月中旬开始。“政治家”报于七月八日报导称：马来亚当局正在凶残地镇压人民起义。巴基斯坦时报载称，英海军及空军也在对反抗者作战。过去三星期内，已有千余人被捕。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社伦敦九日讯：英共机关报“工人日报”，用最强烈的言词痛斥英驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳，他在广播中对马来亚解放运动的参加者施行威吓。“工人日报”写道，麦克唐纳及其所代表的树胶园主，正在称他们的政敌——所有批评独裁及殖民地政权的人，所有在工会中组织自己并敢于为争取较高工资而罢工的人——为“恐怖主义者”。马来亚人民正在为争取民主及工会权利以及适当的生活水准而斗争。把马来亚变成警察国家，并实施恐怖统治的，正是马来亚的树胶园主。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：消息报评论马来亚的局势称：广大人民运动正在马来亚发展中，而英国报界所散布的关于“外国共产党分子”的神话，只是用以转移人民对于殖民政权剥削的注意。人民起义的原因，应在英国殖民政策中去寻找，这种政策已将马来亚居民压榨到穷苦不堪，没有法律保障以及在树胶园和锡矿中作奴隶劳动的地步。日军占领期间英国曾满不在乎地答应给马来亚人民以自治；但无数次的诺言至今只是纸上空谈。更甚于此的是：英国垄断资本家在面临着美国战争的情况下，正更进一步抑灭已经如此悲惨的马来亚工人的工资，借此牺牲马来亚劳苦人民的利益，以弥补其利润的损失。英国当局的行动，已再一次使殖民地人民深信：穷困与无权利的景况，若不经过为争取民族独立的斗争。是不能消除的。这种斗争乃是民主国家争取和平及国际安全运动的一部分，而资本主义垄断巨头的无限贪欲，正在威胁着和平及国际安全。
