【JiZhong News】 Shen County's Advancement Society convened a meeting of agricultural loan cadres and branch society directors on June 5th to review and summarize loan work, and discuss the focus of future loan inspection and usage. From March 25th to May 29th, the county issued a total of 1,140,590,000 yuan in loans (border region currency), reaching 207 impoverished villages, including 406 middle peasant households and 3,053 poor peasant households. Among these, agricultural loans amounted to 779,570,000 yuan, accounting for 68.35% of the total loans, driving private investment of 21,034,000 yuan. This facilitated the purchase of 382 head of livestock, 1,456 pieces of farm equipment (including plows, harrows, carts, hoes, etc.), as well as fertilizers and seeds. Sideline loans totaled 191,450,000 yuan, accounting for 16.8% of the total loans, driving private investment of 6,309,000 yuan, supporting 15 lumber mills, 13 cotton ginning groups, 3 oil mills, 3 paper mills, and 82 weaving groups. The oil pressing group in Nanshao Village, Fifth District, originally had 14 shares, each worth 200,000 yuan. The Advancement Society loaned them 6,000,000 yuan. The group, with women shelling peanuts and watching the millstones, and men doing heavy work, earned 7,000,000 yuan in 20 days. Water conservancy loans totaled 169,560,000 yuan, accounting for 14.85% of the total loans, driving private investment of 10,385,000 yuan, enabling the digging of 10 foreign-style wells, the purchase of 59 waterwheels, the repair of 4 old waterwheels, and the purchase of 224 water buckets. Loan inspection work has become more thorough than before, with inspections conducted concurrently with loans, extensive visits, physical verification, and mobilization of the masses for mutual inspection, yielding good results. While the county's loan work has achieved the above results, some deviations have also occurred. In some districts, the work was not thorough, vacillating back and forth, and the mass line was not well implemented; some borrowers took the opportunity to engage in mischief. Some villages had unclear procedures, incorrect deadlines, and failed to submit reports on time, making it difficult to monitor. To improve future loan work, the meeting proposed three suggestions: (1) The focus of future loans should be on vigorously developing water conservancy. Therefore, loans that have matured should be recovered in a timely manner and converted into water conservancy loans, ensuring continuous circulation. (2) Further implement production policies, conduct universal inspections, and urge the masses to truly use the funds for production. Loans should be resolutely recovered from those who waste funds, demand money, or engage in speculative transactions. (3) The accounting department should send special personnel to each society to inspect loan procedures and account management, to correct and prevent confusion in procedures and accounts.

　　大力发展水利
    深县确定贷款重点
    【冀中讯】深县推进社于六月五日，召集农贷干部及各分社主任开会，检查总结贷款工作，讨论今后贷款的检查和使用的重点。自三月二十五日到五月二十九日，全县共贷款十一亿四千零五十九万余元（边币，下同），贷到二百零七个穷困的村庄，计中农四百零六户，贫农三千零五十三户。其中农业贷款七亿七千九百五十七万余元，占贷款总数的百分之六十八点三五，带起私资两亿一千零三十四万余元。买牲口三百八十二头，农具一千四百五十六件（包括犁、耙、大车、锄等），及肥料种子等。副业贷款共一亿九千一百四十五万余元，占贷款总数百分之十六点八，带动私资六千三百零九万余元，扶助了木厂十五座，轧花组十三组，油坊三组，造纸厂三组，纺织组八十二组。五区南邵庄的榨油组原有十四股，每股二十万，推进社贷给六百万元。该组由妇女搓花生、看碾子，男人干重活，二十天赚了七百万元。水利贷款一亿六千九百五十六万元，占贷款总数百分之十四点八五，带动私资一亿零三百八十五万元，打洋井十眼，买水车五十九辆，修理旧水车四辆，买水斗子二百二十四个。贷款的检查工作比以前深入了，随贷随检查，多方面访问，检查实物，并发动群众互相检查，效果甚好。该县贷款工作，虽有以上成绩，也发生了一些偏向。有的区工作不深入，左右摇摆，没很好贯彻群众路线，有的贷款人乘机捣了鬼。有的村办理手续不清，期限不对，报告表不按时作，很难掌握。为改进今后贷款工作，会上提出三个意见：（一）今后贷款重点，应是大力发展水利，因此贷款到期的，应及时收回来，转为水利贷款，作到周转不息。（二）进一步贯彻生产政策，普遍进行检查，督促群众把款真正用到生产上去。对浪费、要钱、作投机买卖的，应坚决将款收回。（三）会计部应派专人到各社检查贷款手续和帐目管理，纠正与防止手续与帐目混乱现象。
