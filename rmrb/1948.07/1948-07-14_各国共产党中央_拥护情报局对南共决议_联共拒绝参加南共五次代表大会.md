　　Communist Parties of Various Countries
    Endorse the Cominform Resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Party
    Soviet Communist Party Refuses to Attend the Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th] The resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Party issue passed by the Cominform meeting has been approved by the central committees of the communist parties of the countries that sent representatives to the meeting, and has been endorsed by the communist parties of the United States, Britain, Austria, and the German Socialist Unity Party. However, the leading organs of the Yugoslav Communist Party continue their erroneous policies, refusing to accept and prohibiting the publication and distribution of this resolution in the country. The Tito clique, on the one hand, slanders the Cominform resolution as "fabrications and libel," and on the other hand, mobilizes its followers, accomplices, and those temporarily deceived by it to express "loyalty" to Tito. The American imperialists make no secret of their joy at this action of the Tito clique, immediately praising "Tito as the only true national hero in Eastern Europe," and using the unfreezing of Yugoslav gold deposits in the United States as bait (according to Agence France-Presse reports from Washington on the 28th of last month and the 7th of this month). The Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party has announced that the Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party will be held on the 21st of this month and has invited the communist parties of various countries to send representatives to attend. TASS Moscow, 6th,电 reported: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has decided to refuse this invitation, "because the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party refused to participate in the Cominform meeting, thus placing itself outside the communist family."

　　各国共产党中央
    拥护情报局对南共决议
    联共拒绝参加南共五次代表大会
    【新华社陕北十一日电】共产党情报局会议所通过的关于南斯拉夫共产党问题的决议，已被派有代表参加会议的各国共产党中央所批准，并获得美、英、奥等国共产党和德国统一社会党的拥护。但是南斯拉夫共产党的领导机关仍继续其错误政策，拒绝接受并禁止在两国发表和发行这一决议。铁托集团一面污蔑情报局决议是“造谣诽谤”，一面动员其追随者、胁从者和暂时受其蒙蔽者向铁托表示“效忠”。美帝国主义者毫不掩饰他们对于铁托集团这一行动的喜悦，立即称颂“铁托是东欧唯一真正民族英雄”，并以解冻南国在美存金作为钓饵（据法新社华盛顿上月二十八日及本月七日电）。南共中央宣布将于本月二十一日召开南共第五次代表大会，并邀请各国共产党派代表参加。塔斯社莫斯科六日电称：苏联共产党中央委员会已决定拒绝这个邀请，“因南共中央曾拒绝参加共产党情报局会议，从而使自己处于共产党大家庭之外”。
