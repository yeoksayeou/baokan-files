The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee introduce experiences in drought-resistant planting and seedling protection.

　　The dog days are coming, and planting has reached its final stage. Some areas have not yet been planted in wheat stubble fields due to drought. Most areas have already been planted due to sufficient spring rain, but small seedlings are showing signs of drought, and some are even dying in severely affected areas. Therefore, we should vigorously protect seedlings and organize emergency planting. Here are some experiences in fighting drought over the years for your reference.

　　Technical experience:

　　I. Drought-Resistant Planting

　　(1) Carrying water for spot planting: First, use a harrow to fine the soil (without large clods), use a hoe to dig holes at certain plant and row spacing, pour water into them, and wait for the water to seep in. When it doesn't form a mud ball when you pinch it by hand, put the seeds in. In this way, the water is deep and the covering soil can be firm and dry slowly. The seeds should be soaked in warm water two days before spot planting, which will make them germinate and emerge twice as fast as dry planting. After spot planting, harrow again once the next night to make it more drought-resistant. (2) Dry land planting: If the distance from the water source is too far and there is really no way to carry water for spot planting, dry land planting can be used. Shallowly sow the seeds in dry land, and they can germinate after a light rain, which is much more reliable than turning the land after a light rain and then sowing. Even if there is a thorough rain, the seedlings will emerge several days earlier than sowing after the rain. "A day's difference in spring is a ten-day difference in autumn," and the yield in autumn will also be very different. (3) Planting by furrow: Predict what crops to plant, and use a plow or drill to sow ditches according to the plant and row spacing of the crop, or use a hoe to dig holes. If there is a light rain, put the seeds in and level them with a harrow. Even if the rain is light, the seeds will be in wet soil above and below, ensuring germination. A light rain can be as good as a heavy rain. (4) Soil Moisture Preservation: If it rains lightly and there is no time to rush to plant, you can harrow the land that you are unable to plant at the moment to keep the humidity for a longer time. Another way to preserve moisture is to soak two-inch-long sorghum or corn stalks in water, put two or three roots in each hole when spot planting, and then water and put in the seeds to keep them from drying out for a longer time. (5) Finding moisture for planting: If the land is not deeply dry, but cannot be plowed, you can use a hoe to dig deep holes, turn out the wet soil, cover the seeds with wet soil above and below, and then level it with a harrow.

　　II. Launching a Seedling Protection Campaign

　　(1) The most common and easy way is to hoe more. As the saying goes, "Hoeing in dry weather," "The hoe has water." More hoeing makes the soil finer, and moisture does not evaporate easily, which can resist drought. Pay attention to the hoeing method: shallow hoeing is suitable for small seedlings to avoid hurting the roots. More roots are easier to absorb moisture. Hoe in the morning and evening, and do not hoe at noon, so as not to evaporate a lot of moisture when hoeing. (2) If the drought is more severe, the only way is to water. In order to use less water and get greater results, you can use a two-foot-long wooden stick with a diameter of about one inch, sharpened to a point, to insert a six- or seven-inch-deep hole next to the small seedlings (about two inches away), and pour water into it with a teapot. After the water seeps in, bury it with soil. Generally, 20 loads of water per mu can water the entire corn field. (3) After a light rain, rush to hoe the seedlings and cover the roots of the seedlings with a little soil, which can withstand the drought for a few more days. (4) Prevention and control of aphids (spider mites): Cotton and beans are prone to aphids in dry weather. The prevention and control method is also very simple: use one pound of white flour, five pounds of water, and mix it into a paste, then add seventy-five pounds of water, stir evenly, and sprinkle it on the leaves on a sunny day; or put a large bowl of slurry, bend the crops over and brush them, which saves slurry and is thorough.

　　We should use the greatest strength to rationally organize spot planting, seedling protection, and drought resistance. There are also many experiences in organizational methods in various places:

　　(1) The most important thing is that the leadership should pay attention and be vigilant, seize the urgent needs of the masses for drought resistance and seedling protection, overcome the paralysis and fluke mentality of relying on the sky for food and waiting for rain, and mobilize all labor (male and female, main and auxiliary labor) to participate in this struggle. It is necessary to rationally organize and use labor. Last year, in Neiqiu Chengguan, 95% of the men, women, old and young participated in spot planting; Wucun organized 21 mutual aid groups to dig wells during the day and spot planting under the moonlight. People were free, but the wells were not. The elderly dug holes, the young and middle-aged carried water, women poured water into the holes, and children put in seeds. In order to save labor, various types of labor should be properly allocated according to life needs, and the mutual free adjustment between groups should be promoted to maximize labor. (2) Rationally solve the problem of water use, which is more important in water-scarce areas. First, dig wells and springs to increase water sources. Second, in order to avoid wasting water, each group can separate water wells or pools according to the situation (it must be democratically decided fairly and reasonably), or agree on which groups will use water in the morning and which groups will use water in the afternoon to avoid everyone using water at the same time, so that the water is not enough and labor is wasted. (3) Rationally use tools. Last year, the 120 water buckets in Bao Huang Dahe Road Village were not enough. Six oil baskets, three wine baskets, and twelve large pots were all used, and more water buckets were purchased. Mutual adjustments were also made between groups.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会农林厅介绍
    抗旱播种和保苗经验
    伏天将到，播种已达最后关头，有些地区因天旱不雨，麦茬地尚未播种。大部地区因春雨不缺，已经下种。但小苗已呈旱象，严重地区且有枯死现象。因此应该大力保苗，并组织抢种。兹介绍几点历年来和旱灾斗争的经验，供大家参考。
    关于技术方面的经验：
            一、抗旱下种
    （１）担水点种：先用耙把地耙细（没有大坷垃），按一定的株距行距用＠头刨窝，倒进水去，等水渗完，到用手去捏不至成为泥块时，将种子投入。这样水阴的深，覆土亦可结实，干燥较慢。种子要在点种前两天用温水浸过，比干种发芽出土要快一倍时间。点种后过一夜再用耢（也有叫擦子的）耢一次，更加耐旱。（２）干地寄种：距水源太远，实在没法担水点种时，可以干地寄种。把种子浅浅的干耩上，如过小雨即可发芽，比小雨后翻一下地再耩有把握的多。就是下了透雨，也比雨后下种早出苗数日。“春差一日秋差十日”，秋后产量亦会相差很大。（３）接垧下种：预计种什么作物，皆按照这种作物的株行距距，用犁或耧耩下壕子，或用＠头刨下窝子。如遇小雨把种子投入，用耢耢平，雨虽小种子上下都是湿土，保险可以出苗，小雨可顶大雨用。（４）保垧：天下了小雨，一时又抢种不完时，可一面突击下种，一面把当下无力播种的地耢一下，湿度可多保持些时间。另一种保垧办法，是点种时把二寸长的高粱或玉茭杆用水浸透，每窝放二三根，然后浇水投入种子，可保持较长时间不旱。（５）找垧下种：如地干的还不深，但用犁耧耩不出来，可用＠头刨成深窝子，将湿土翻出，种子上下均复以湿土，再用耢耢平。
            二、开展保苗斗争
    （１）最普通易行的是多锄。俗话说：“天旱锄田”、“锄头有水”。多锄使土变细，湿气不易挥发，可以而旱。锄法上要注意：小苗宜浅锄，不要伤了根，根多易吸收潮气；要早晚锄，中午不要锄，免得锄的时候湿气大量挥发掉。（２）如旱的更历害了，唯一的办法是用水浇。为了用水少而收效大，可以二尺长直径约一寸的木棍，削成尖头，在小苗旁（约二寸许）插一个六七寸深的窟窿，用茶壶把水灌入。待水阴下去后，用土埋住。一般玉蜀黍每亩有二十担水即可浇完。（３）天下了小雨后，要突击锄苗，苗根覆点土，可多耐几天旱。（４）防除火龙（火蜘蛛）：天一旱棉花和豆子就要生火龙。防除办法也很简单：用白面一斤、水五斤，打成浆糊，再兑入七十五斤水，搅拌均匀，晴天时洒在叶上；或把浆糊汤盛上一大碗，把庄稼弯过来刷一刷，又省浆糊又周到。
    应该以最大力量合理的组织点种保苗抗旱工作。组织办法各地也有不少经验：
    （一）最主要的是领导上重视起来，警觉起来，抓紧群众抗旱保苗的迫切要求，克服靠天吃饭、等待落雨的麻痹侥幸心理，动员一切劳动力（男女主辅劳力）投入这个斗争，要合理的组织使用劳力，去年抗旱点种，内邱城关男女老少整半劳力百分之九十五参加点花；吴村组织了二十一个互助组，白天掏井，月下点花，人闲井不闲。老头刨窝，青壮年担水，妇女往窝里倒水，儿童投子。为节省劳力，要使各种不同劳力根据生活需要恰当的配备，发扬组和组互相自由调剂，把劳动力发挥到最高度。（二）合理的解决用水问题，缺水的地区更为重要。第一、掏井、掏泉，增加水源。第二、为避免浪费水，各组可根据情况把水井或水池分开（须民主决定公平合理），或议定那些组上午使水，那些组下午使水以免大家都同时使水，水又不够而浪费劳力。（三）合理的使用工具，去年宝皇大河道全村一百二十付水桶不够用，把油篓六付、酒篓三付，大锅十二口都用起来，并添购水桶。各组之间，又作了互相调剂。
