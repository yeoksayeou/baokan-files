　　Xinhua News Agency Northeast, 29th—The Tongbei Farm and the Songjiang Provincial First Farm, operated by the Northeast Administrative Committee, have achieved significant results in using tractors for land reclamation. The two farms have recently reclaimed and sown nearly 2,000 hectares (one hectare equals ten mu) in a short period. The tractors used in the Tongbei Farm are all medium-sized machines with 45 horsepower. Additionally, over 40 horses and four large plows were used. During reclamation, an average of eleven tractors were deployed daily, using a method of arranging them in a line and reclaiming land in a circular pattern, which not only saves gasoline but also allows for mutual communication and response, saving time and reclaiming more land. When each tractor tows 20,000 jin of weight on a dry, hard road, the speed is twelve li per hour. If the soil moisture is suitable, towing a four-铧 (four-bladed) large plow can reclaim eight hectares per hour; towing a five-铧 or six-铧 large plow can reclaim more than sixteen hectares per hour. (Note: Although five-铧 and six-铧 plows are heavier than four-铧 plows, they still do not exceed the horsepower limit of medium-sized tractors, and the speed reduction is not significant. Five-铧 plows have a larger plowing surface, while four-铧 plows have a smaller plowing surface, so towing a five-铧 plow reclaims more land than towing a four-铧 plow.) If calculated on the basis of ten hours of work per day, compared to the productivity of ordinary farmers who can only reclaim six mu per day with four horses pulling a foreign plow, the rate can generally be increased by at least 130 to 260 times. The reclaimed land is then pulverized by machines. Each pulverizer carries forty circular harrows, and can harrow twenty-six hectares in ten hours. However, due to the wet ground this year, in order to avoid mud and increase the difficulty of using machinery, attention was paid to land selection and surveying before reclamation. The farm has more than 140 staff members, including more than ten experienced technicians and more than 40 newly trained young trainees, who are now able to fully master driving skills and carry out simple repairs. In the reclamation process, due to the launch of labor emulation drives and the appropriate attention given to everyone's lives during the shock work, the production enthusiasm of the entire farm is extremely high, and daily labor often exceeds fourteen hours. Driver Sun Hongbo drove tractor No. 101 and reclaimed more than one hundred hectares of land in one day, and refused to get off the machine, requesting to continue working the night shift. Under the shock work of the workers, the farm has completed the plan of sowing 1,200 hectares of crops such as rice.
　　The Songjiang Provincial First Farm also quickly completed the land reclamation task in a shock competition. The farm has a total of eight tractors, fifty plowing horses, four four-铧 plows, three three-铧 plows, nine horse-drawn foreign plows, six pulverizers, one large row seeder, and many other farm implements. There are sixty tractor team members (mostly newly trained young students) and eighty farming team members. Every day, four tractors are used for land reclamation, and three others are used for pulverizing and sowing, averaging forty hectares of land reclaimed and sown per day. The farm started plowing in mid-May, and in half a month, more than 600 hectares of soybeans, sugar beets, and other crops were reclaimed and sown. It is now working hard to continue to complete the task of rush-planting 800 hectares of land.

### 通北松江公营农场　拖拉机开荒成绩显著  两农场短期内开荒播种二千垧

　　通北松江公营农场
    拖拉机开荒成绩显著
    两农场短期内开荒播种二千垧
    【新华社东北廿九日电】东北行政委员会经营的通北农场及松江省营第一农场，使用拖拉机开荒，已获显著成绩。两场已于最近短期内开荒播种近两千垧（一垧十亩），通北农场所用拖拉机均为四十五匹马力的中型机。另用马四十余匹，大犁四付。开荒中每天平均出动十一台拖拉机，采用排成一列，纵深转圈开荒的办法，不仅能节省汽油，而且能互相联络呼应，节省时间，多开荒地。每台拖拉机在干硬道上拖运两万斤重量时，速度为每小时十二里。如地皮干湿相宜，拖四铧大犁，每小时能开荒八垧；拖五铧或六铧大犁，则每小时能开十六垧以上。（按五铧、六铧犁虽比四铧犁重，但仍不超过中型拖拉机的马力限度，速力减损不大。五铧犁开垦面大，匹铧犁开垦面小，因此拖五铧犁比拖四铧犁开荒多）。如一天以劳作十小时计算，则较普通农民以四马套一付洋犁，每天仅能开荒六亩的生产率，一般均能至少提高一百三十倍至二百六十倍以上。开过的地再用机器碎土。每台碎土机带四十片圆耙，每十小时能耙地二十六垧。但因今年地湿，为避免泥泞增加使用机器的困难，因而开荒前曾注意了选地测地的工作。该场工作人员共一百四十余人，其中除雇用的十余名熟练技术人员外，并有新近训练的青年学员四十余人，现在他们已能完全掌握驾驶技术，并能进行简单的修理工作。在开荒中，由于发动了劳动竞赛，领导上又适当照顾了大家在突击中的生活，故全场生产情绪极高，每天劳作常在十四小时以上。司机孙鸿波驾驶一○一号拖拉机，一天开了荒地百余垧，还不肯下机，要求继续作夜班。在工友们突击劳作下，该场已完成播种稻子等作物一千二百垧的计划。
    松江省营第一农场亦在突击竞赛中迅速完成了开荒任务。该场共有拖拉机八架，耕马五十匹，四铧犁四架，三铧犁三架，马拉洋犁九付，碎土机六架，大条播种机一架，及其他许多农具。有拖拉机队员六十名（多为新培养的青年学生），耕作队八十名。每日以四架拖拉机开荒，另三架碎土、播种，平均每天可开荒播种四十垧。该场五月中旬开犁，半月中即开荒播种大豆、甜菜等六百余垧，现正为继续完成抢种八百垧地而努力。
