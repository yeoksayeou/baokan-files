Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: According to comprehensive reports from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, in late June, major cities under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, except for Shanghai, continued to be shaken by the violent surge in prices, with the rate of increase exceeding that of Shanghai. In Tianjin, on June 26th, a bag of "Warship Brand" flour cost 16 million Jiao coins, an increase of more than threefold compared to 3.65 million Jiao coins on the 1st of the month; rice cost 360,000 Jiao coins per jin, an increase of 3.3 times compared to 84,000 Jiao coins per jin on the 1st of the month (and higher than the rice price in Shanghai on the same day by 50%); millet cost 250,000 Jiao coins per jin, an increase of threefold compared to 63,000 Jiao coins on the 1st; corn flour cost 170,000 Jiao coins per jin, an increase of 2.4 times compared to 50,000 Jiao coins per jin on the 1st; and "Red Flag Five Blessings" cloth cost 31 million Jiao coins per bolt, 3.68 times the 8.45 million Jiao coins on the 1st.

On June 20th, "Warship Brand" flour in Beiping was already selling for 8.2 million Jiao coins per bag (still 3.4 million Jiao coins per bag on the 1st), and Xiaozhan rice cost 260,000 Jiao coins per jin, about three times the rice price of 85,000 Jiao coins per jin on the 1st; corn flour cost 120,000 Jiao coins per jin, also nearly three times the price of 47,000 Jiao coins per jin on the 1st. Many cigarette and sesame cake stalls in the market have voluntarily closed down.

From the 15th to the 25th of last month, in just ten days, "Warship Brand" flour in Qingdao increased from 4.5 million Jiao coins per bag to 6.5 million Jiao coins, raw oil increased from 37 million Jiao coins per dan to 50 million Jiao coins, and "Double Dragon" fine cloth increased from 11.8 million Jiao coins per bolt to 23.5 million Jiao coins.

The price increase in Jinan "is like a hurricane, surpassing any place in the country in just a few days" (see Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, June 24th). The price increase in Xi'an is also fierce. According to a Tianjin Ta Kung Pao dispatch from Xi'an on the 21st, in one week, "flour has risen directly from 1.8 million to 2.3 million per bag, and when people wake up after a night's sleep, it's another 3.3 million, and there is a price but no market, and the black market has already broken through the 4 million mark."

The malignant surge in prices in Taiyuan has seen increases three or four times within an hour. As of the 20th of last month, "Double Elephant Brand" flour was selling for 26 million Jiao coins per bag, a small piece of laundry soap cost 400,000 Jiao coins, a small package of coffee cigarettes cost 700,000 Jiao coins, sorghum flour cost 370,000 Jiao coins per jin, and an egg cost 60,000 Jiao coins. Dozens of "cooperatives" and "rationing departments" throughout the city did not open for business on the 19th and 20th.

In Shenyang, on the 25th of last month, prices "rose three times a day." Sorghum rice had risen to 690,000 Jiao coins per jin, and "Warship Brand" flour had risen to 46 million Jiao coins per bag, nearly twice the price of flour in Tianjin, and "grain has disappeared from the market, and people are extremely panicked."

Under the violent rule and plunder of the Kuomintang, grain prices in Changchun continue to rise, and the grain shortage is becoming increasingly serious, with 500,000 residents generally trapped in starvation. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 1st of this month, citing the Xin Sheng Bao, only 20% of the city's residents can still afford to eat rice, 21% eat porridge, 23% eat bean cakes (usually used as animal feed), 17% eat tree bark, and 19% beg on the streets.

According to the Tianjin Min Guo Daily, on the 24th of last month, two anti-hunger demonstrations occurred in the city in one day, one by railway workers demanding that their supervising officials' stockpiled grain be "taken out and shared," and the other by citizens demanding that "the grain stored by wealthy households in the city be exposed."

Another report: Rice prices in Wuhan had already risen to 10.8 million Jiao coins per dan as early as June 17th, higher than the then rice price in Shanghai (10 million Jiao coins).

　　蒋区各大城市物价六月下旬暴涨情况
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：六月下旬，蒋介石统治下的除上海以外的各大城市均继续为暴烈的六月物价大涨风所震撼，其上涨速度较之上海有过之而无不及。天津的物价，上月二十六日兵船粉每袋蒋币一千六百万元，较一日的每袋三百六十五万，上涨三倍多；大米每斤三十六万元，较一日的每斤八万四千元，上涨三点三倍（并高于同日上海米价百分之五十）；小米每斤二十五万元，较一日的六万三千上涨三倍；玉米面每斤十七万元，较一日的每斤五万元上涨二点四倍；红牌五福布每匹三千一百万元，为一日八百四十五万元的三点六八倍。上月二十日北平兵船面粉已卖到每袋八百二十万元（一日尚为每袋三百四十万元），小站稻米每斤二十六万元，约为一日米价每斤八万五千的三倍，玉米面每斤十二万，亦为一日每斤四万七千元之价的三倍弱。现市面的香烟摊、烧饼摊很多已自动歇业。从上月十五日至二十五日十天中，青岛兵船牌面粉每袋由四百五十万元，涨至六百五十万元，生油每担由三千七百万元涨至五千万元，双龙细布每匹由一千一百八十万元，涨至二千三百五十万元。济南物价“更如狂风暴雨，不旬日即高出全国任何地方之上”（见六月二十四日天津大公报）。西安物价涨风亦猛，据天津大公报载二十一日西安通讯称：一周中，“面粉已由一百八十万一袋，直升到二百三十万，人们睡一夜起来，又是三百三十万了，而且有价无市，黑市早已突破四百万元大关”。太原物价的恶性猛涨，有在一小时内提升三、四次者，截至上月二十日止，双象牌面粉已卖到每袋二千六百万元，一小块洗衣肥皂要四十万元，一小包咖啡烟要七十万元，高粱面每斤三十七万，一个鸡蛋要六万元。全城数十处“合作社”及“配给部”于十九、二十两日竟日没有开门营业。沈阳物价上月二十五日更是“一日三涨”，高粱米已涨至每斤卖蒋币六十九万元，兵船粉已涨至每袋四千六百万元，几高出天津面粉价格两倍，且“粮已绝市，人心极为恐慌”。国民党暴力统治掠夺下的长春，粮价不断上涨，粮荒日益严重，五十万居民普遍陷于饥饿绝境。据美联社本月一日电引新生报载称：全市居民还吃得到饭的仅占百分之二十，其余百分之二十一吃粥，百分之二十三吃豆饼（平常为牲口饲料），百分之十七吃树皮，百分之十九行乞街头。据天津民国日报消息：上月二十四日一日内，该市即发生两起反饥饿示威，一为铁路工人要求将其主管官员所囤积的粮食，“拿出来分吃”，另一则为市民要求“检举市内富户的存粮”。另息：武汉米价早在六月十七日即已涨至每担一千零八十万元，而高出于当时的上海米价（一千万元）。
