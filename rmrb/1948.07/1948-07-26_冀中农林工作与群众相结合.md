Jizhong Electric: Since the rectification of cadres in Jizhong's agricultural experiment stations and promotion work in the first half of the year, the work enthusiasm has increased. Breaking the confines of the farms and gradually going into the countryside to combine with the masses, has achieved many successes. The various farms often use one-third or one-half of their strength to mobilize the masses outside to plant trees, control pests, soak seeds, select seeds, and hold exhibitions and symposiums, which has begun to expand the influence of the farms and take root among the masses. The Xinji Farm used eight cadres to mobilize the masses in seventeen villages, including Dadongping in Zhao County, to control pests. In more than fifty days, they treated 9,714 mu of pear orchards, so that more than 2,300 pear trees that could not produce pears this year can be expected to bear fruit next year (if not treated, they will not bear fruit for three years). Other orchards with more serious insect pests can also harvest 70% this year; those with less severe pests can expect a bumper harvest. The Yunbaishan Farm promoted 7,186 jin of various improved cotton seeds, 15,949 jin of various grain seeds, 235,000 strains of various yam seedlings, and 189 jin of indigo in 118 villages in nine counties. They personally soaked seeds for 78 households, leading 32 households to soak 589 jin of seeds. They selected wheat seeds for 430 households, leading 34 households to select 2,220 shi (equivalent to 2,410 jin). They treated 9,736 mu of pear orchards for pear insects, 12,264 plants for jujube curculio oil insects; planted 35,776 trees, removed 134,800 diseased wheat plants (220 jin) of various kinds, treated 43 mu of wheat armyworms, 4 mu of wheat fire beetles, 29.5 mu of persimmon aphids, and treated 63 head of livestock. When the Jizhong Administrative Office's Agricultural and Forestry Department held a farm meeting in the last ten days of last month, in addition to summarizing the above achievements, it also examined many shortcomings in the work: such as some farms lacking investigation and research and a long-term implementation spirit in the promotion process, considering the seeds promoted to be the end of the matter, lacking inspection and follow-up, etc. At the same time, it was determined to combine indigenous methods with foreign methods, technology with the masses, and farms with administration. Those promoted must be inspected; the five major insect pests must be prevented and controlled in an organized and focused manner (cotton aphids and fire spiders in the 9th and 11th districts, grain armyworms in the 8th district, vegetable worms and pear insects in the 9th district, etc.). Secondly, seed selection for grains, corn, sorghum, etc. should be carried out during the autumn harvest, and seed soaking should be carried out when planting wheat. The promotion of technical work should focus on using organized mutual aid and cooperative societies, and organizing the masses through technology. Without experimentation and without 100% certainty, random promotion is not allowed, and the crops of the masses cannot be used for experimentation at will.
    [Another News] The 26 members of the Jizhong Administrative Office's Promotion Team departed on the 4th of this month for Jin County in the 11th District and Li County in the 9th District, etc., to promote pest control work in the cotton-growing areas. They plan to draw one person from each promotion station in the counties of the 9th and 11th districts to work and train cadres at the same time. After learning the treatment methods, they will return to their original stations to mobilize local pest control.
    [Another News] As the rainy season is approaching, in order to test afforestation in the rainy season, a team from the afforestation team went to Bieying, Hejian, to test afforestation in saline-alkali land. Another team went to Ningjin to cooperate with the local government and Xinji Farm to carry out afforestation work in the rainy season based on existing habits.

　　冀中农林工作与群众相结合
    【冀中电】冀中上半年的农事试验场及推广工作，由于农场干部整党后工作情绪提高，打破了农场的圈子，逐步深入农村与群众结合，已获得不少成绩。各场经常以三分之一或二分之一的力量在外发动群众植树、治虫、浸种、选种、开展览会、座谈会，开始扩大了农场影响，在群众中扎下了根。辛集农场以八个干部在赵县大东平等十七村发动群众治虫，五十多天治了九千七百一十四亩地的梨虫，使今年不能收梨的二千三百多株梨树，明年可望结果（如不治，三年不结果），其他虫灾较重的，今年也能收七成；灾轻的可望丰收。云白山农场，在九个县一一八村推广各种优良棉籽七千一百八十六斤，各种谷种一万五千九百四十九斤，各种山药秧二十三万五千株，蓝靛一百八十九斤。亲自给群众浸种七十八户，带动三十二户，浸种五百八十九斤。给群众选小麦种四三○户，带动三十四户，选了二二二○石（合二四一○斤）。治梨虫九千七百三十六亩，枣步曲油虫一二二六四株；植树三五七七六株，拔除小麦各种病株十三万四千八百株（二百二十斤），麦黏虫四十三亩，麦火蚶子四亩，柿蚜二十九亩半，医治牲口六十三头。上月下旬冀中行署农林厅召开农场会议时，除总结上述成绩外，并检查了工作中不少缺点：如有些场在推广中缺乏调查研究和长期贯彻的精神，种子推出去就算完事，缺乏检查跟进等。同时确定要将土法与洋法相结合，技术与群众相结合，农场与行政相结合。对推广出去的要检查；要有组织有重点的防除五大虫害（九、十一分区的棉蚜、火蛛子，八专区的谷黏虫，九分区的菜虫、梨虫等）。其次是在大秋时应进行谷、玉米、高粱等选种，种麦时浸种。技术工作的推广，要着重运用组织起来的互助合作社，通过技术把群众组织起来。没试验过，没十成把握的，不准随便推广，不能拿着群众的庄稼随便作试验。
    【又讯】冀中行署推广队二十六人，于本月四日分赴十一专区晋县、九专蠡县等棉区推广除虫工作。他们计划从九、十一专区各县推广场各抽一人，一面工作，一面训练干部，把治法学会后各回原场，在当地发动治虫。
    【又讯】雨季将到，为试雨季造林，造林队一组赴河间行别营试行碱地造林。另一组到宁晋配合当地政府及辛集农场在旧有习惯上开展雨季造林工作。
