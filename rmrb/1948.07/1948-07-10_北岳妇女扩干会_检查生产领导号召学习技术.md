Northern Yue Women's Expanded Cadre Meeting
    Inspecting Production Leadership and Calling for Technical Learning

    [Northern Yue News] The Northern Yue Women's Expanded Cadre Meeting revealed several production issues among women that urgently need to be addressed: 1. The voluntary nature of organization versus spontaneous drift. In previous years, the leadership called on the masses to organize and engage in labor exchange and mutual assistance, which indeed overcame many difficulties in individual production. However, many places committed the mistake of formalism. Some cadres subjectively prescribed complicated systems of work point recording, equal distribution, self-criticism, and reporting for the labor exchange groups, resulting in significant work-hour losses, which the masses saw as a burden. Some said, "You mobilize for production every day, but you also cause a lot of trouble every day." Some people who actually participated in mutual assistance and labor exchange groups even kept it secret, fearing that cadres would come and impose rigid systems on them. Some comrades, failing to correctly recognize and correct their own commandism and formalism, mistakenly believed that all organization was necessarily formalistic and displeasing to the masses, and simply stopped advocating for organization altogether, allowing production to drift spontaneously. They did not understand that labor exchange and mutual assistance could solve many difficulties that individuals could not overcome in production and could improve production efficiency, etc. Therefore, overcoming formalism in production leadership on the one hand, and overcoming the idea of ​​spontaneous drift that rejects leadership on the other, has become an important issue in improving current production. 2. In the past, some places rigidly separated adult men from women and children to form labor exchange groups, causing some work that could have been done by women and children to be done by adults, wasting labor. 3. Women engaged in sideline production need loan support. Currently, the demand for women to develop sideline occupations in various places is very urgent, but many have stalled due to a lack of funds. When issuing loans, the care given to them is also very poor. If Hunyuan County can guarantee to exchange shoes for cloth, it can collect more than 20,000 pairs of shoes per month; but because this problem has not been resolved, shoes are made but cannot be sold, tying up capital, and most have stopped. 4. Among female cadres who are divorced from production, very few have production skills. Some who originally had experience have mostly forgotten it after coming out, or are unwilling to work again. It is difficult to achieve results by having people who do not understand production lead production; therefore, it is urgently necessary to educate female cadres to intensify their study of production knowledge and technology so that they can better lead the broad masses of women in production and avoid making mistakes of subjectivism and formalism.

　　北岳妇女扩干会
    检查生产领导号召学习技术
    【北岳讯】在北岳妇女扩干会上，发现妇女生产上有几个问题亟待解决：一、组织起来的自愿与自流。前几年领导上号召群众组织起来，拨工互助，确实克服了不少个体生产中的困难；但不少地方犯了形式主义的毛病。有些干部主观地给拨工组规定了复杂的记工、齐丁、检讨、汇报等制度，误工很多，群众视为负担。有的说：“你们天天动员生产，可是天天又给很多麻烦。”有些实际参加了互助拨工小组的人，因怕干部来给他们硬订制度，甚至保持着秘密。有些同志没有正确认识与纠正自己的强迫命令和形式主义，反错认为凡是组织起来，一定是形式的，群众不高兴的，就索性停止了对组织起来的倡导，一任生产自流。没弄清拨工互助可以解决个人生产中许多不能克服的困难，可以提高生产效率等等好处。因此，一方面克服生产领导上的形式主义。创造简单易行的组织办法，一方面克服不要领导的自流思想，就成为当前提高生产的一个重要问题。二、过去有些地方，硬把壮年男人和妇女儿童分开编组拨工，使一些本来可由妇女儿童做的工作也让壮年去做，浪费了劳力。三、妇女进行副业生产，须要贷款扶助，目前各地妇女开展副业的要求很迫切，多因缺乏资金而停顿着。贷款发放时，对她们照顾的也很差。浑源县如能保证以布换鞋，每月即可收鞋两万双以上；但因这个问题未解决，做了鞋卖不出，压住了本，大都停止了。四、脱离生产的妇女干部中，有生产技术的太少。原来有些经验的出来以后也多忘了，或不愿再劳动。以不懂生产的人来领导生产很难收效；所以急须教育女干部们加紧学习生产知识与技术，使能很好的在生产中领导广大妇女，不犯主观主义与形式主义的错误。
