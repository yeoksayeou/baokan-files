Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: The soaring prices in Shanghai on June 25th and 26th caused unprecedented chaos in the market. According to reports from various foreign news agencies, on the 26th, gold reached 210 million yuan in Kuomintang currency per tael, an increase of 10 million yuan from the 25th. A pair of shoes, which cost 7 million yuan before the 16th, now costs 50 million yuan. A pack of "Good Luck" brand cigarettes costs 800,000 yuan, while British-made "Black Cat" or "Three Fives" cigarettes, popular among middle-class families, cost over 1 million yuan per pack. According to statistics, the prices of flour, rice, cotton yarn, white cloth, soap, matches, and cigarettes rose by 60 to 80 percent in the seven days leading up to late June, and wholesale prices increased by 200 percent compared to June 1st (United Press, Shanghai, 27th). According to Reuters, the Kuomintang municipal government ordered on the 27th that the food market, including rice, flour, grains, and edible oil, be suspended from trading until further notice. The agency stated that Shanghai workers have become uneasy due to soaring prices, and they have demanded that the cost of living index be revised every half month, based on the daily increase in rice prices rather than the weekly rice price. According to an Associated Press report from Nanjing on the 28th, Wang Yun-wu, the Minister of Finance of the Chiang government, has been forced to resign due to his inability to control prices.

　　上海市场益形混乱
    传王云五将被迫辞职
    【新华社陕北三日电】六月二十五、二十六两日的上海物价暴涨，曾使市场陷于空前的混乱。综合各外国通讯社消息：二十六日，黄金每两为蒋币二亿一千万元，较二十五日又涨一千万元。一双鞋子，十六日前价值七百万元，现在则要五千万元，一包“好运道”牌香烟要八十万元，一般小康之家爱吸的英国制的“黑猫”牌或“三五”牌香烟每包更在百万元以上。据统计：面粉、大米、棉纱、白布、肥皂、火柴、纸烟六月下旬之前七天上涨了百分之六十到八十，批发价格较六月一日上涨百分之二百（合众社沪二十七日电）。据路透社报导，国民党市政府已于二十七日下令，在新的训令发出以前，粮食市场包括大米、面粉、谷类和食油，一律停止交易。该社称，上海工人已因物价暴涨而陷于不安，他们已要求生活指数每半月改订一次，并以逐日上升的米价而不是以每周米价为根据。另据美联社南京二十八日电：蒋政府财政部长王云五已因无能控制物价，而被迫提出辞职。
