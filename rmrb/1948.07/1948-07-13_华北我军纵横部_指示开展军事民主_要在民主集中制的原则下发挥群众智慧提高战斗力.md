　　North China Military Column
    Directs Development of Military Democracy
    Emphasizing the Principle of Democratic Centralism to Harness Mass Wisdom and Enhance Combat Effectiveness
    [Frontline News] The North China People's Liberation Army Military Column recently issued instructions on developing military democracy, emphasizing its role as a guiding ideology and principle for army building. The instructions clearly state the purpose of developing military democracy: to fully leverage the genius of the masses, concentrate the wisdom of millions of soldiers, and remedy the shortcomings in combat command, military training, and administrative management that commanders may overlook, thereby enhancing the correctness of leadership. To stimulate the initiative and creativity of the entire army, continuously improving tactics and techniques, and further harmonizing and uniting officer-soldier relations. To further regularize the troops and consolidate and enhance combat effectiveness. To this end, first, it is necessary to eliminate ideological obstacles among commanders and fighters and establish a correct understanding of military democracy. It is necessary to correct the erroneous thinking among some commanders who believe that implementing military democracy will lead to the development of extreme democracy, making management difficult, affecting personal prestige, and making it impossible to maintain discipline. At the same time, it is necessary to correct the thinking among some commanders and fighters who believe that military democracy allows them to disregard discipline, disobey orders, or use the shortcomings of superiors as an excuse to cover up their own mistakes. Second, it is imperative to correctly grasp the principle of democratic centralism. Third, under the unified leadership of the Party, military and political organs must strive for ideological and volitional unity, closely coordinate their work, and fully recognize this as an important long-term task in army building. It must be integrated with the combat and work tasks of each period. Regarding the steps and methods of development, the instructions decided: First, cadres should earnestly study the editorial of the East China People's Frontline Newspaper "Several Principles for Developing Military Democracy" and the part on army-building principles in "On the Liberated Area Battlefield" to understand its spirit, implement these instructions, and promptly discover and correct various erroneous understandings. Soldiers should be educated using methods such as class discussions, and then cadres and soldiers should all engage in self-reflection, especially cadres should conduct self-criticism, connecting with reality to clarify their thinking. Second, with the degree of ideological development, attention should be paid to cultivating and discovering typical examples, summarizing experiences, and promoting overall progress.
