　　Handan Jiaojiayao Carpentry Mutual Aid Cooperative
    Loan to Expand Operations
    [Jinan News] The Handan Jiaojiayao Carpentry Mutual Aid Cooperative in Handan City has been supported by bank loans and its business is expanding daily. This cooperative was formed in August of last year by Wang Jindong, the director of the trade union, and nine carpenters. Each person invested labor as shares, and profits were distributed according to shares. In the early stages, due to a lack of capital and raw materials, they relied solely on outside work, building diligently. Later, everyone pooled together 135,000 yuan in wages (Jicha, same below) to buy six rooms (including three storefronts). In November, they obtained a low-interest loan of 200,000 yuan from the bank to purchase raw materials. Since then, they have been doing both outside and inside work. By the end of the year, after settling accounts, in addition to each person earning a net wage of 1,500 yuan per day, each person was also able to receive a dividend of more than 30,000 yuan. Seeing the benefits, three more carpenters joined. This spring, they obtained another loan of 360,000 yuan from the bank to expand their business. In total, in the past nine months, the cooperative has made a net profit of 1.14 million yuan. They are now planning to recruit apprentices to continue expanding operations.

　　邯市焦家窑木工合作社
    贷款扩大经营
    【冀南讯】邯郸市焦家窑木工互助合作社由银行贷款扶植起来，业务日益扩大。该合作社系由工会主任王金栋结合九个木匠，于去年八月组成，每人以劳力入股，按股分红。初期因无资金原料，专靠外活，辛勤建设。后来大家集凑一部工资十三万五千元（冀钞，下同），买房六间（内有三间门面），十一月又到银行低利贷款二十万购买原料，自此一面做外活，一面做内活。至年底结帐时，除每人每日净赚工资一千五百元外，每人还能分红三万余元，另有三个木匠看着有利，也参加了。今春又到银行贷款三十六万元，扩大业务。总计九个月来，该社已获纯利一百一十四万元。现正筹划招收学徒，继续扩大经营。
