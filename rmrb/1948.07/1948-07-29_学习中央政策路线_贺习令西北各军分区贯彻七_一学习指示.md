Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 21st. After the Northwest Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "July 1st" cadre study instructions, He Long, Commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Allied Defense Army, and Xi Zhongxun, Political Commissar, along with Deputy Commander Wang Weizhou and Director of the Political Department Li Zhuoran, issued a special order to all military regions to earnestly implement it. This was to ensure that the instructions were carried out throughout the army in order to strengthen the study of the Party Central Committee's policy line by the troops' cadres, eliminate all undisciplined behavior, and further consolidate the unity and solidarity of the troops. The order instructed all military regions that in addition to earnestly studying and implementing the Northwest Bureau's instructions, they must also pay attention to the following points: (1) In terms of linking with reality, emphasis should be placed on summarizing the rich experience in combat; reviewing the policy thinking and policy implementation of the cadres in the troops; and focusing on disrespect for the Party's organization, failure to resolutely implement orders, failure to report important situations of the troops to higher levels; acting independently, violating the unified system, concealing seized materials, undermining discipline, alienating the masses, and desertion. Criticism and self-criticism should be carried out in the study, examining the causes and responsibilities, and discussing improvement measures. (2) In terms of method, the experience of the "Three Check-ups" movement should be studied and adopted, with the focus on promoting democracy, clearing up thinking, and raising the class consciousness of cadres and soldiers; avoid simple accusations and routine introspection. Do not hold study meetings without preparation. (3) Cadres at the military region level should, as far as possible, organize studies jointly with the main local Party and government cadres, so as to promote democratic criticism under the unified leadership of the Party committee, earnestly examine and improve work, and further consolidate the unity between the local authorities and the troops, and close the relationship between the army and the people. (4) Political organs at all levels of the troops should formulate study plans separately based on the specific circumstances of the troops (marching, combat, or rest, dispersed or concentrated), and report the progress and experience to the Joint Political Department.

　　学习中央政策路线
  　贺习令西北各军分区贯彻七·一学习指示
    【新华社西北二十一日电】中共西北中央局“七一”干部学习指示发出后，陕甘宁晋绥联防军司令员贺龙、政委习仲勋，副司令员王维舟、政治部主任李卓然等特通令各军分区切实执行，使这一指示得以贯彻全军，以加强部队干部对党中央政策路线的学习，消灭一切无纪律状态，更加巩固部队的统一与团结。通令命令各军分区除应切实研讨执行西北局指示外，并须注意下列几点：（一）在联系实际方面，应着重总结战斗中的丰富经验；检讨部队干部中的政策思想与政策执行的情况；对不尊重党的组织，不坚决执行命令，不向上级反映部队重要情况；各自为政，违犯统一制度，隐瞒缴获物资，破坏纪律，脱离群众以及逃亡现象等，均应在学习中展开批评与自我批评，研究其产生的原因与责任，并讨论改进办法。（二）在方法上应研究并接受三查运动经验，以发扬民主、打通思想，提高干部战士阶级觉悟为主；避免简单的指责与照例的反省。不要开没有准备的学习会议。（三）军分区级的干部尽可能与当地党政主要干部共同组织学习，以便在党委统一领导下，发扬民主批评，切实检讨与改进工作，进一步巩固地方与部队团结，密切军民关系。（四）部队各级政治机关，应根据部队的具体情况（行军、作战或休整，分散或集中），分别订出学习计划，并将进行情况与经验报告联政。
