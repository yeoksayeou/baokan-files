Anguo County District Cadres Commemorate the Party's Birthday
　　Establishing Various Systems and Disciplines
    Resolutely Overcome the State of Undisciplined and Unorganized
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to commemorate "July 1st," strengthen the ideological training of Party members, and improve work efficiency, the Anguo County Party Committee convened an enlarged meeting of 283 county and district cadres on June 22nd to investigate leadership, examine ideology, rectify the organization, rectify the system, and overcome the state of undisciplined and unorganized behavior. On the first day, the County Party Committee first stated its attitude, explaining that the County Party Committee had shortcomings in its leadership since the purge and replenishment movement and sincerely welcomed every comrade to boldly put forward their opinions during the commemoration of the Party's birthday in order to transform the leadership of the County Party Committee. It also called on every Party member to simultaneously examine themselves, improve themselves, and help others. At the meeting, "Lenin on the Standards of Soviet Workers" was studied. After two days of casual talks, discussions, and criticisms, everyone examined the following shortcomings in the leadership of the County Party Committee: 1. The analysis of problems was not careful enough, and the boundaries of policies were not clearly distinguished. In addition, the County Party Committee also had leftist sentiments, which contributed to the leftist sentiments of some comrades. For example, in the early stage of the purge and replenishment movement, in the Wazi Village of the Fourth District, landlord women were beaten. The County Party Committee introduced this wholesale in a circular, and other districts learned from it. Individual members of the County Party Committee spoke imprudently, which had a negative effect on some cadres. 2. Instructions on issues were not clear and specific enough, so that those below did not know what to do after reading the instructions. For example, when instructing on rectifying deviations, the class division standards in the 1933 document and Comrade Ren Bishi's report were not explained in terms of which amount of exploitation should be calculated, so those below were confused after reading it. 3. The leadership force was not unified enough. The County Party Committee was assigned to various districts, and the work steps were sometimes inconsistent. When expanding the army, some districts had already done a good job, while the First District was still engaged in land reform. 4. The understanding of the situation of cadres was not deep enough, and the problems of cadres were not solved in a timely manner. Problems that should have been solved were not solved. 5. Sometimes, a piece of work could not be carried out to the end. After individual villages received instructions to "stop the struggle and distribute floating wealth," there were no further processing methods, and the doors are still sealed. In their self-examinations, the general district and county cadres also discovered some non-proletarian consciousness, the main ones being: (1) Some people have developed degenerate ideas. When encountering problems in their work, they felt depressed and unwilling to do hard work, wanting to go home. Some also felt that revolutionary work was not as comfortable as eating and working at home. (2) Some cadres had no regard for organization or discipline. ××× of the First District wanted to marry an improper woman and even wanted to admit her into the Party. ×× of the Third District was not active in his work, sleeping all day and going to market. When a district cadre was transferred, he said to the organization: "Transfer me? I wanted to go home a long time ago." Many cadres firmly refused to be transferred to other districts. (3) Some cadres were burdened with ideological baggage, were not bold in their work, and were afraid of taking responsibility. Some felt that their class background was good, served as backbones during the ideological examination, and showed pride when they arrived in the village. On the third and fourth days of the meeting, a memorial ceremony was held to commemorate the martyrs who died. The County Party Committee announced its determination to thoroughly overcome the shortcomings raised by everyone in the leadership. According to the discussion results of each group, Zhang Genbo, Tian Xuekun, Wang Zhen, and other 25 comrades who resolutely obeyed transfers, worked hard and responsibly, actively studied, and helped others were rewarded on the spot. Du Zhongju and Jiao Tiqing, the district committee members of the Third District who had consistently disobeyed transfers and left their posts without authorization, were given the punishment of expulsion from the Party and a warning, respectively. Finally, the County Party Committee promoted a group of rewarded comrades and announced and passed the organizational discipline and work system: The County Party Committee will meet before the 25th of each month to check and arrange work. The district committees will meet once a month to mainly study the instructions of the higher authorities, check the degree of implementation, and solve various important problems. Each district will report its work to the County Party Committee before the 10th of each month. Rectify the organization branches to bring Party life back to normal, strengthen ideological leadership, solve problems when they arise, and report to the County Party Committee if they cannot be solved. In order to strengthen leadership, set up flag villages (key villages) in each district to cultivate backbones, assign district committee members to lead, and district secretaries to grasp the overall situation of the district, and solve problems through collective research. The district committees will regularly go to various sub-districts to check, grasp the ideology of cadres, criticize the bad ones and praise the good ones. Improve the two-hour study system. The meeting lasted for five days, and everyone's morale was high and their understanding gradually improved. Comrade Li Pu, the district secretary, said: "I will resolutely obey the transfer. As soon as the higher-level makes a resolution, I guarantee not to bargain at all." The cadres of the Third District and the Chengguan District guaranteed that they would work with peace of mind at this meeting. Zhang Congxin of the First District guaranteed: "I will overcome my degenerate ideas, guarantee never to commit them again, and ask everyone to supervise me. If I commit them again, I am willing to be sanctioned by Party discipline." Comrade Chen Guang, on behalf of the County Party Committee, swore to Chairman Mao and all the cadres: "Humbly listen to everyone's opinions and improve the leadership style." After the meeting, Qi Huanzhang said: "Such a meeting should have been held long ago. This time, many problems can be solved." (Wang Guang, Hong Guang, Wen Zheng)

　　安国县区干部纪念党的生日
  　确立各种制度纪律
    坚决克服无纪律无组织状态
    【本报讯】为了纪念“七一”，加强党员的思想锻炼，提高工作效率，安国县委于六月二十二日召开全体县区干部二百八十三人的扩大会议，查领导，查思想，整组织，整制度，克服无纪律无组织的状态。第一天县委首先表明了态度，说明自抽补运动以来，县委在领导上曾有缺点，诚恳欢迎每个同志在纪念党的生日时，大胆的把自己的意见提出来，以便改造县委的领导。并号召每个党员同时检讨自己，提高自己，帮助别人，会议上学习了“列宁论苏维埃工作人员的标准”。经过两天的漫谈、讨论、批评，大家检讨出县委领导上存有如下缺点：一、研究分析问题不仔细，对政策界限没有分清，加之县委亦有左的情绪，以致助长了一些同志的左倾情绪。如抽补运动初期，四区洼子里吊打地主女人，县委在通报上原盘的介绍出去，别的区就有的学了起来。有个别县委说话不慎重，对某些干部起了不好的作用。二、指示问题时不够明确具体，使下面看了指示不知怎么办是好。如指示纠偏时，对一九三三年文件和任弼时同志报告中划阶级标准，也没说明到底按那个剥削分量计算，所以下面看了很糊涂。三、领导力量不够统一，县委都分到各区，工作步骤有时不一致，扩军时有的区已经干得不错了，一区还在搞土改。四、深刻了解干部情况、及时解决干部问题做得很差，该解决的问题没有解决。五、进行一件工作，有时不能贯彻下来。个别村庄接到“停止斗争分浮财”的指示后，没有进一步处理的办法，现在还封着门。一般区县干部在自我检讨中，也发现了若干非无产阶级意识，其中主要的是：（一）有些人产生了蜕化思想，作工作碰到钉子，情绪低落了，不愿作艰苦的工作，想回家。也有些人觉着革命工作不如自己在家吃点干点痛快。（二）有些干部目无组织目无纪律。一区×××想和一个不正派的妇女结婚，竟想把她吸收入党。三区××不积极工作，成天睡大觉、赶集。一个区干在调动时对组织上说：“还调我？我早就想回家”。不少干部向外区调动时坚决不去。（三）一些干部思想上背着包袱，工作不大胆，怕负责。有的觉着自己成份好，查思想时当过骨干，到村里表现骄傲。会议的第三、四天，举行纪念仪式，追悼死难烈士，县委宣布决心彻底克服大家对领导上所提缺点。并根据各小组讨论结果，当场奖励了坚决服从调动，工作艰苦负责，积极学习，帮助别人的张根波、田学坤、王珍等二十五个同志，对于一贯不服从调动，私自脱离工作岗位的三区区委杜中聚、焦提清分别给予开除党籍和警告的处分。最后县委提拔了一批受奖的同志，并宣布与通过了组织纪律与工作制度：县委每月二十五日前开会，检查与布置工作，每月月底各区区委会议一次，主要研究上级指示，检查执行程度，解决各种重要问题，各区十号前向县委报告工作。整顿机关支部，使党的生活步入正规，加强思想领导，有了问题就解决，解决不了的报告县委。为加强领导，在各区设旗帜村（重点村）培养骨干，区委分工领导，区书掌握全区，有问题大家研究解决。区委经常到各小区检查，掌握干部思想，批评坏的表扬好的。健全二小时学习制。会议前后经过五天的时间，大家情绪饱满，认识逐步提高。区书李普同志说：“我要坚决服从调动，上级一决议，保证一丝一点不讲价钱。”三区和城关区干部保证在此次会议，一定安心工作。一区张从心保证：“克服自己的蜕化思想，保证永不再犯，并要求大家监督，再犯了愿受党纪制裁。”陈光同志代表县委向毛主席向全体干部宣誓：“虚心听取大家意见，改进领导作风。”会议结束后，齐焕章说：“象这样的会，早就应当开，这一下可解决问题不少。”（王光、红光、文正）
