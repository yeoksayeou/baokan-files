　　Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei Front, 17th—A frontline reporter commented on the victory of the People's Liberation Army in the recent Eastern Hebei campaign, saying: During the 24-day offensive operation from June 2nd to 25th, parts of the North China People's Liberation Army and the Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning People's Liberation Army successively achieved three major victories in the Eastern Hebei area, including the surprise attack on Fengrun, the destruction of the Ping-Gu line, and the capture of Changli, eliminating more than 13,000 enemy troops, and dealing another heavy blow to the enemy's attempt to secure the Hebei-Jehol-Liaoning corridor. During this period, Fu Zuoyi implemented his so-called "new strategy" of using main forces against main forces and concentration against concentration, wanting to engage in "mobile warfare" with the People's Liberation Army. Now, facts have proven that Fu Zuoyi's so-called "new strategy" has created insurmountable new contradictions for himself. His concentration of forces resulted in the isolated points and lines losing defensive strength, while the so-called mobile forces were insufficient to cope with the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army. In this Eastern Hebei front campaign, the People's Liberation Army first carried out destruction on the Ping-Gu line, attracting nearly four corps of Fu Zuoyi's forces, including the 94th, 16th, 92nd, and Provisional 3rd Corps. At this time, the People's Liberation Army took advantage of the situation to launch an offensive on the northern side of Tang (shan) Luan (xian), achieving the victory of recovering Fengrun and eliminating more than 6,000 enemies. When Fu's enemy dragged the 16th Corps, 92nd Corps, and Provisional 3rd Corps to reinforce Fengrun, the People's Liberation Army rapidly launched a major destruction on the Ping-Gu line, occupied Shixia and Xiaoying, eliminated more than 2,000 enemies, and advanced directly to Gubeikou. Fu's enemy then turned back to the west to reinforce Ping-Gu overnight, and just as they arrived in Miyun and Shunyi, the People's Liberation Army launched a destruction of the Luan-Yu section and achieved the victory of occupying Changli, eliminating 4,000 enemies, and capturing Lieutenant General Tang Yisheng, the chief of the traffic police. In these 20-plus days of combat, in the face of the offensive of our People's Liberation Army, Fu's enemy was unable to attend to both the head and the tail, was beaten everywhere, and was exhausted from running around. His embarrassment of being stretched thin can be said to have demonstrated the "mobile warfare" to the fullest extent.

　　前线记者评冀东之战
    傅匪“机动作战”结果处处挨打
    【新华社冀东前线十七日电】前线记者评述解放军此次冀东作战胜利称：从六月二日至二十五日的二十四天攻势作战中，华北解放军及冀察热辽解放军各一部，在冀东地区连续取得了奇袭丰润、破击平古、攻克昌黎等三次大捷，歼敌一万三千余人，使敌确保冀热辽走廊的企图，受到再次的有力打击。在这一时期，傅作义实行其所谓以主力对主力，以集中对集中的所谓“新战略”，要与解放军“机动作战”。现在事实证明，傅作义的所谓“新战略”，恰恰给他自己制造了不可克服的新矛盾。他集中兵力的结果，既使孤立的点线失掉防御力量，而所谓机动兵力又不足应付解放军的强大攻势。这次冀东前线解放军首先在平古线进行破击，把傅作义第九十四、第十六、第九十二及暂编第三军等将近四个军的兵力吸引过来；此时解放军则乘势向唐（山）滦（县）北侧发动攻势，取得了收复丰润歼敌六千余的胜利；待傅敌拖着第十六军、第九十二军及暂编第三军增援丰润时，解放军又在平古线神速的展开了大破击，占领石匣、小营，歼敌二千余，大军直逼古北口；傅敌于是又连夜回头西援平古，甫抵密云、顺义，解放军又发起破击滦榆段，并取得占领昌黎，歼敌四千，生俘交警中将支队长汤毅生等的胜利。在这二十多天的作战中，傅敌在我人民解放军的攻势面前，顾了脑袋就顾不了屁股，到处挨打，疲于奔命，其捉襟见肘的窘态，可谓把“机动作战”表演得淋漓尽致了。
