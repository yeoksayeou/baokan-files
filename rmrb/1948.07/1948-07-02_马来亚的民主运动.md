　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Malaya is located in the southwest of our country and is a British colony. According to statistics at the end of June 1941, the total population was 5.5 million, of which overseas Chinese accounted for approximately 2.4 million. After enduring more than 160 years of enslavement under British imperialism, and especially after more than three years of anti-Japanese war, their national consciousness has been greatly enhanced.

　　When the Japanese invaders invaded the south and the British army was defeated and surrendered, the people of Malaya fought bravely for national liberation and made great contributions to the war of resistance against Japan. However, more than a month after the Japanese surrender, the British army returned to Malaya and not only failed to meet the demands of the Malayan people for freedom and liberation, but forcibly disarmed the "Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army" led by the Malayan Communist Party, which had persisted in fighting the enemy for three years. They also successively arrested anti-Japanese elements and their leaders, and announced the restoration of all pre-war reactionary laws, including deportation orders and sedition laws. Lord Mountbatten, Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, openly supported the military police in maintaining so-called "public order" in February 1946 and prohibited freedom of assembly. The three major policies adopted by the Malayan authorities—unconditionally banning Japanese military currency, buying rubber at low prices, and controlling trade—caused a large number of business bankruptcies, as well as serious unemployment, poverty, and bankruptcy. All these reactionary measures aroused the Malayan people's struggle for work, bread, and democratic rights.

　　In October 1945, Singapore first saw a major strike by 9,000 dockworkers and 2,000 public utility workers, opposing low wages and opposing military assistance to the Netherlands to suppress the Indonesian liberation movement. Subsequently, strikes, market boycotts, and demonstrations demanding work and bread spread throughout central and northern Malaya. In January 1946, the authorities arrested Wang Jingguang, chairman of the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army, unreasonably searched the headquarters of the General Federation of Labor in Senai, and shot and killed assembled masses. This further triggered a violent strike of 190,000 people in Singapore and a market strike of 95% of the shops in Malaya, paralyzing transportation and public institutions. In March of the same year, there was another all-Malaya strike of 500,000 people protesting the arrest of Song Guang, a leader of the People's Anti-Japanese Army.

　　In order to ease the resistance of the Malayan people, British imperialism announced the so-called "Malayan Federation" plan at the end of 1946 (also known as the "Malayan New Deal," which began to be implemented on February 1 this year). The "New Deal" stipulates that Singapore and the Malay Peninsula should be divided into two administrative regions. Singapore is directly ruled by a governor appointed by the United Kingdom, while the Malay Peninsula organizes a nominal "Malay Federation," with each state "independent," but in reality, the British High Commissioner to the "Malay Federation" manipulates it from within, holding military and political power. The "New Deal" stipulates that the "Malayan Federation" will establish a so-called "Legislative Council" composed of British colonial officials and pro-British elements in Malaya, and promulgate so-called "citizenship rights" aimed at dividing and provoking unity among the various ethnic groups in Malaya (with particularly harsh restrictions on overseas Chinese obtaining "citizenship rights"). This so-called "New Deal" fundamentally did not change Malaya's colonial status. This new deception, aimed at continuing to maintain British enslavement rule in Malaya, was opposed by the Malayan people. The Pan-Malayan Political Organizations Joint Action Committee, led by the Malayan Communist Party and with 440,000 members, united people from all ethnic groups and strata in Malaya to launch a movement against the Malayan Federation plan in July last year, and drafted the "People's Constitution." In October, there was another general strike of 100,000 people across Malaya against the "Malayan Federation Plan." In January of this year, the Pan-Malayan Political Organizations Joint Action Committee announced a boycott of the Malayan Federation Legislative Council. When the United Kingdom officially established the Malayan Federation and implemented the "New Deal" on February 1, the Singapore General Federation of Labor launched a protest strike by 30,000 workers. Offices of various left-wing political parties in Malaya flew flags at half-mast to express their protest. The Malayan Democratic Front also held mass rallies to expose the British political conspiracy to establish the Malayan Federation and sent a telegram to the British government demanding the immediate abolition of the "New Deal." Since the general strike of transportation and dock workers in Singapore in April, the Malayan people have been continuously waging heroic struggles against oppression and hunger.

　　Wu Tianwang (transliteration), one of the leaders of the Malayan Communist Party, pointed out at the conference of representatives of communist parties from British territories held in London last March that the strength of the Malayan Communist Party, the savior of the Malayan people, "has increased fivefold." He said, "The Malayan people have fully recognized the new tricks of imperialism and will continue to fight for democratic representative system, freedom, and peace, and will never give up until they achieve their goals."

　　马来亚的民主运动
    【新华社陕北廿九日电】马来亚位于我国西南部，是英国的殖民地。据一九四一年六月末统计，共有人口五百五十万，其中华侨约占二百四十万人，在备尝英帝国主义一百六十余年来奴役统治之后，特别是经过三年多抗日战争的锻炼之后，他们的民族觉悟已大为提高。
    马来亚人民在日寇南侵，英军败北投降之后，为了民族的解放，曾进行了英勇的战斗，对抗日战争极有贡献。但是日寇投降后的一个多月，英军回到了马来亚，不仅没有让马来亚人民达到自由解放的要求，反而以暴力将马共领导的坚持三年对敌斗争的“马来亚人民抗日军”强行缴械，并相继逮捕抗日分子及其领袖，宣布恢复战前一切反动法令，包括驱逐令、煽动法令等。东南亚盟军统帅蒙特巴顿于一九四六年二月公然支持军警维持所谓“公共秩序”，并禁止集会自由。马来亚当局所采取无条件的禁用日本军用票、低价收买树胶、及统制贸易的三大政策，造成商界的大批倒闭，以及严重的失业贫穷与破产。这一切反动措施，激起马来亚人民要求工作、面包和民主权利的斗争。
    一九四五年十月，新加坡首先爆发九千名码头工人与二千名公共事业工人的大罢工，反对低微工资，反对予荷兰军事援助以镇压印尼的解放运动。接着，要求工作与面包的罢工、罢市与示威请愿运动，遍及马来亚的中部与北部。一九四六年正月间，当局逮捕马来亚人民抗日军主席王锦光，无理搜查仙奈总工会会址，并枪杀集会群众，更激起了新加坡十九万人的抗暴大罢工和马来亚百分之九十五的商店的罢市，使运输交通及公共机关均陷于瘫痪状态。同年三月，又发生抗议民抗军领袖宋光被捕事件的全马来亚五十万人的大罢工。
    为了缓和马来亚人民的反抗，英帝国主义于一九四六年底公布了所谓“马来亚联邦”计划（或称“马来亚新政制”，已于今年二月一日开始实行）。“新政制”规定划新加坡与马来半岛为两国行政区。新加坡由英国委派总督直接统治，马来半岛则组织名义上的“马来联邦”，各邦“独立”，而实际上则由英国驻“马来亚联邦”之高级专员从中操纵，掌管军政大权。“新政制”规定“马来亚联邦”成立由英国殖民地官员与马来亚亲英分子凑合的所谓“立法议会”，并颁布以分化和挑拨马来亚各民族团结为目的的所谓“公民权”（对华侨获得“公民权”限制特别苛刻）。这种所谓“新政制”根本没有改变马来亚的殖民地地位。这一旨在继续维护英国在马来亚奴役统治的新欺骗，遭到马来亚人民的反对。以马共领导的全马民主阵线为主体，拥有四十四万会员的泛马来亚政团联合行动委员会，曾联合马来亚各民族各阶层人士，于去年七月间发起反马来亚联邦计划的运动，并起草了“人民宪草”。十月间又发生全马十万人反对“马来亚联邦计划”的总罢业。今年正月间泛马来亚政团联合行动委员会宣布抵制马来亚联邦立法议会。当二月一日英国正式成立马来亚联邦及实施“新政制”时，新加坡总工会发动了三万名工人的抗议大罢工。马来亚各左冀政党办公处下半旗致哀，表示抗议，马来亚民主阵线亦举行群众大会，揭露英国成立马来亚联邦的政治阴谋，并致电英政府，要求立即废止“新政制”。自四月间新加坡交通与码头工人的总罢工发生以来，马来亚人民一直不断地为反压迫和反饥饿进行着英勇的斗争。
    马共领袖之一的伍天旺（译音），去年三月在伦敦召开的英帝国各属领共产党代表大会上指出：马来亚人民的救星——马共的力量，“已经增长了五倍”，他说：“马来亚人民已充分认识到帝国主义的新计策，并将继续为民主代议制、自由与和平而斗争，不达目的决不罢休”。
