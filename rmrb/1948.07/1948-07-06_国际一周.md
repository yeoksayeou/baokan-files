　　International Week
    (June 26th to July 2nd)
    　　　　European Front:
    Following the reactionary London Six-Nation Conference, the Soviet Union and seven Eastern European New Democratic countries held an eight-nation foreign ministers' conference in Warsaw from June 23rd to 24th. This conference put forward a "program for the German question that serves the interests of all countries and truly serves the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism" (Molotov). The conference issued a solemn declaration stating the two basic attitudes of the eight countries on the German question. First, the eight governments firmly oppose the London secret agreement concluded by the six countries of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. This secret agreement aims to ultimately split Germany politically and economically, obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, resist the demilitarization and democratization of Germany, restore Germany's war potential, and make West Germany's economy subordinate to US-British capital, etc. These measures violate the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. Second, the eight governments are willing to follow the spirit of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements and, through the agreement of the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, finally demilitarize Germany, control the Ruhr heavy industry, establish a democratic provisional government for all of Germany, conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and resolve the issue of German reparations. The attitude of the Warsaw Conference on the German question has been widely sympathized with by the masses in countries such as France and Italy. The Roman Evening News stated: "Western countries must accept the Warsaw proposal and immediately start four-country negotiations. This is the only path left for them."
    In accordance with the London secret agreement, the US, British, and French authorities in Germany announced a so-called "currency reform" on June 18th. This order was implemented separately in West Germany starting on June 21st, replacing the Mark that originally circulated throughout Germany with a new "Deutsche Mark." The purpose of this move is "to ensure that large financial groups, especially those German monopolists who maintain close ties with US-British monopoly capital, profit; for the working people of western Germany, it is an extremely tyrannical exploitation" (Warsaw Conference Declaration). Because as a result of this so-called "currency reform," one new Mark is equivalent to ten old Marks, the value of the originally circulating Marks has been greatly reduced, and the material conditions of the working people in West Germany will inevitably deteriorate rapidly; it has also created new difficulties in economic relations with other countries. This "currency reform" has aroused strong protests from the German people. The German People's Committee, the German Socialist Unity Party, and the German Economic Commission, representing all strata, parties, and organizations in Germany, have successively issued declarations strongly protesting this divisive and reactionary behavior. In order to protect the interests of the German people in the Soviet occupation zone, the authorities in the Soviet occupation zone, in addition to expressing protests, had no choice but to announce that starting from the evening of June 18th, traffic between the eastern and western occupation zones would be suspended, and land and water freight could only pass after thorough inspection; and decided that starting from June 24th, currency reform would be implemented throughout the territory of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany and the entire Berlin area, ensuring that all wages and prices remain at their original levels in order to protect the interests of the working people.
    In order to protest the Federation of Employers' refusal to re-determine wages, the Italian General Confederation of Labor issued an order on June 24th, calling on workers across the country to hold a half-day general strike on July 2nd. Following the Turin general strike on June 15th, another half-day general strike of 300,000 workers in Milan occurred on the 24th, as well as a one-day general strike of workers in the provinces of Pisa and Brescia, and a strike of 120,000 food workers nationwide on the 26th. The national one-hour general strike called for by the French General Confederation of Labor to protest the Clermont-Ferrand bloodshed took place on time on June 19th. Following an agreement with the factory, the general strike in the city of Clermont-Ferrand has ended. The general strike of 250,000 steelworkers in Belgium has also ended, and workers can receive a "diligence bonus" roughly equal to three percent of their original wages. The strike of 20,000 dockworkers in the Port of London, England, continues to persist despite various threats from the Labor Party government and labor traitors. 11,000 dockworkers in Liverpool and Birkenhead are now also holding sympathy strikes to support the dockworkers in London.
    　　　　American Front:
    The Second Session of the 80th US Congress adjourned on June 20th. Under the collusion of the reactionary factions of the Republican and Democratic parties, this session passed the $6.03 billion "foreign aid" appropriation bill (including $4 billion for the "Marshall Plan" and $400 million for the "Aid to China (Chiang)" plan) to support reactionary forces in Western Europe and the Far East, and also passed a conscription bill calling for American youth aged 19 to 25 to serve for 21 months, as well as a huge military budget of around $14 billion. The last few days of the US Congress meeting saw fierce struggles over the "foreign aid" appropriation bill. The House of Representatives passed it on June 4th, reducing the total amount of "foreign aid" appropriations from $6.533 billion for twelve months to $5.933 billion for fifteen months. Subsequently, the Senate passed a bill on the 16th for $6.125 billion for twelve months. The final compromise appropriation bill passed by the joint committee of the two houses was nominally $6.003 billion for fifteen months.
    The US Republican National Convention, which opened in Philadelphia (Philadelphia) on June 21st, passed a reactionary platform on the 23rd that represents the interests of American financial capitalists. This platform advocates continuing to pursue an aggressive foreign policy and implementing labor repression domestically. Under the behind-the-scenes manipulation of financial tycoons and party bosses, reactionary figures New York Governor Dewey and California Governor Warren were "elected" as the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates in this year's election.
    　　　　Far East Front:
    Mass uprisings in Malaya against British oppressive policies and ethnic discrimination have been expanding in June. The occurrence of this incident is the result of the British Malayan ruling authorities adopting policies of economic plunder and anti-communist and anti-democratic policies; however, the British authorities continue to adopt high-handed policies and fabricate rumors that the Chinese Communist Party participated in the incident. After the riots occurred, the British authorities granted the military and police "special emergency powers" and implemented crazy suppression. As of June 22nd, 821 people had been arrested, and on June 24th alone, 22 people were expelled from Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.
    The Siamese fascist war criminal Luang Phibunsongkhram government, in cooperation with the Kuomintang secret service, carried out a large-scale arrest of overseas Chinese in mid-June. Overseas Chinese schools and organizations were subjected to searches; the principal and faculty of Nanyang Middle School, the General Association for National Construction and Saving the Homeland of Overseas Chinese, the Education Association, and democratic figures such as the General Labor Union have been arrested. Siamese overseas Chinese democratic newspapers such as Quanmin Bao and Bangkok Shangbao have been monitored, and the Ministry of Interior of the Luang Phibunsongkhram government is plotting to expel a large number of overseas Chinese democratic figures.
    The Viet Minh commemorated the "1000th Day of Viet Minh Resistance" on June 21st. Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a statement condemning France's conspiracy to establish a puppet government, and announced: "All agreements that the puppet government and any foreign country may conclude are invalid." At the same time, General Nguyen Binh, supreme commander of the Viet Minh army in South Vietnam, ordered the arrest and prosecution of Nguyen Van Xuan, chairman of the Vietnamese puppet "Provisional Central Government."
    On June 23rd, Japan broke out with a major strike at 24 universities and colleges. As of the 26th, 110 schools had been drawn into the strike wave, with striking students protesting the government's proposal to increase tuition fees.

　　国际一周
    （六月二十六日至七月二日）
    　　　　欧洲方面：
    在反动的伦敦六国会议之后，苏联及东欧七个新民主主义国家于六月二十三日至二十四日在华沙举行了八国外长会议。这个会议提出了“切合一切国家的利益而且真正为和平、民主和社会主义事业服务的对德问题方案”（莫洛托夫）。会议发表了严正的宣言，表明了八个国家在对德问题上的两个基本态度。第一，八国政府坚决反对美英法比荷卢六国缔结的伦敦密约，该密约旨在从政治上经济上最终分裂德国，阻挠对德和约的缔结，抗拒德国非军国主义化与民主化，恢复德国的战争潜力，使西德的经济附属于美英资本等等，这些破坏雅尔塔波茨顿协议的措施。第二，八国政府愿意遵照雅尔塔及波茨顿协议的精神，以苏美英法四国协议的办法，使德国最后非军国主义化，管制鲁尔重工业，建立全德民主临时政府，缔结对德和约以及解决德国赔偿问题。华沙会议对德国问题的态度，受到法意等国群众广泛的同情。罗马新闻晚报说：“西方国家必须接受华沙建议，并立即开始四国谈判，这是留给他们的唯一道路。”
    按照伦敦密约，德境美、英、法当局六月十八日宣布了所谓“货币改革”，这个命令于六月二十一日起在西德单独实行，以新的“德意志马克”代替原来流通德国全境的马克。这一勾当的目的，“在于保证大财阀，首先是那些与美英独占资本维持密切联系的德国独占资本家获利；对于德国西部劳动人民，则是极端横暴的剥削”（华沙会议宣言）。因为这个所谓“货币改革”的结果，一个新马克等于十个旧马克，原来流通的马克价值大大地贬低了，西德劳动人民的物质条件，必然加速的恶化；对其他各国经济关系也造成了新的困难。这种“货币改革”，引起德国人民的强烈抗议。代表全德各阶层、各党派、各团体的德国人民委员会、德国统一社会党和德国经济委员会，都相继发表宣言，强烈抗议这种分裂的反动行为。为了保护苏占区德国人民的利益，苏占区当局除表示抗议外，亦不得已宣布自六月十八日晚起，停止东西占领区之间的交通，水陆货运也必须经过彻底检查后才许通过；并决定自六月二十四日起，在德境苏占区和大柏林区的整个领土内实行货币改革，保证一切工资物价维持原有水平，以保护劳动人民的利益。
    为了反对厂主联合会拒绝重新厘定工资的要求，意大利总工会于六月二十四日发出命令，号召全国工人在七月二日举行总罢工半天。六月十五日都灵总罢工之后，二十四日又发生了三十万米兰工人的半天总罢工，彼萨及布里西亚省工人的一天总罢工，和廿六日全国十二万食品工人的罢工。法国总工会为抗议克勒蒙腓隆流血事件所号召的全国一小时总罢工，已于六月十九日按时举行。在与厂方获得协议以后，克勒蒙腓隆城的总罢工已告结束。比利时廿五万钢铁工人的总罢工亦已结束，工人可获得约等于原有工资的百分之三的“计勤酬金”。英国伦敦港两万码头工人的罢工，不顾工党政府和工贼们的各种威胁，仍在坚持中。利物浦及伯肯黑德的一万一千码头工人现亦举行同情罢工，以声援伦敦的码头工人。
    　　　　美国方面：
    美国第八十届国会第二次会议已于六月二十日闭幕。在共和与民主两党反动派的串演下，这次会议通过了扶植西欧与远东反动势力的六十亿三千万元的“援外”拨款法案（其中包括“马歇尔计划”四十亿元与“援华（蒋）计划”四亿元），又通过了征召十九岁至二十五岁美国青年服役二十一个月的征兵法案以及一百四十亿元左右的庞大军事预算。美国国会最后几天的会议，在“援外”拨款法案问题上展开了激烈的斗争。众院于六月四日通过。将“援外”拨款总数由为期十二个月的六十五亿三千三百万元，削减为十五个月的五十九亿三千三百万元。其后，参院又于十六日通过了为期十二个月、为数六十一亿二千五百万元的法案。最后在两院联席委员会上通过的，是名义上仍为十五个月的六十亿零三千万元的折衷拨款法案。
    自六月二十一日起在费城（费拉得尔非亚）召开的美国共和党全国代表大会，于二十三日通过了代表美国金融资本家利益的反动政纲。这一政纲主张对外继续执行侵略外交，对内实行压迫劳工。在金融巨头与党魁们的幕后操纵之下，反动分子纽约州州长杜威与加利福尼亚州州长华伦，被“选”为该党今年大选中的正副总统候选人。
    　　　　远东方面：
    马来亚反抗英国压迫政策和民族歧视的群众暴动，在六月份内日益扩大。这次事件的发生，是英国马来亚统治当局采取经济掠夺及反共反民主政策的结果；但英国当局仍继续采取高压政策，并捏造中国共产党参与此次事件的谣言。暴动发生以后，英国当局授予军警“特别紧急权力”，实行疯狂的镇压。迄六月二十二日止，已有八百二十一人被捕，仅六月二十四日一天，自新加坡及马来亚联邦被逐出境者即达二十二人。
    暹罗法西斯战犯銮披汶政府，在国民党特务机关合作之下，六月中旬对华侨大肆搜捕。华侨学校和社团横遭搜查；南洋中学校长、教职员、华侨建国救乡总会、教育协会及职工总会等民主人士已有四十一人横遭逮捕。暹罗华侨民主报纸如全民报、曼谷商报等均被监视，銮披汶政府内政部并蓄谋将大批华侨民主人士驱逐出境。
    越盟于六月二十一日纪念“越盟抵抗千日纪念日”。越南民主共和国总统胡志明发表声明，斥责法国成立走狗政府的阴谋，并宣布：“走狗政府和任何外国可能缔结的一切协定概属无效”。同时，南越越盟军最高指挥官阮平将军，下令缉捕越南伪“临时中央政府主席”阮文春归案法办。
    日本于六月二十三日爆发了二十四所大学及高等学校的大罢课。至二十六日止，已有一百一十所学校卷入罢课浪潮，罢课学生抗议政府增加学费的建议。
