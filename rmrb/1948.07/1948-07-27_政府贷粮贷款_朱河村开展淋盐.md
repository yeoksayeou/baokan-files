　　Government Grain Loan
  　Zhuhe Village Develops Salt Leaching
    [North Yue News] Under the leadership and support of the democratic government, the salt leaching industry in Zhuhe Village, Zhengding Fifth District, has developed rapidly. After the village was liberated last year, 22 households voluntarily started leaching salt. Later, due to repeated intrusions by Chiang Kai-shek bandits into Zhengding City, people became anxious, and the industry fell into a state of self-flow. This spring, after research at the production meeting, a total of 31 groups were organized, including the 22 households from last year. Nine new leaching ponds were opened, and there are now 62 drying ponds. Each group is under the unified leadership of the production director; special personnel are responsible for soil preparation, water leaching, and salt drying. Some people wanted to participate, but could not expand due to a lack of tools and food. Later, the government provided a loan of 4,000 jin of millet, and 13 more groups were organized. Currently, the entire village has 45 groups, 44 leaching ponds, and 88 drying ponds. On average, they can produce 2,200 jin of salt per day, earning 3.66 million Border Region currency. The living problems of many people have been solved as a result. The elderly Cheng Qun couple and their two daughters happily said, "Last year we produced 3,000 jin of salt. If we work harder this year, we can exceed half of last year's output, and life will be better." Many others said, "In the old society, officials wouldn't allow us to leach salt. If we secretly leached a little, we would be punished if caught. Now the government lends us grain to help us leach salt, so we should work hard." Now each leaching pond can support fifteen people. Small salt production has solved the problem of food shortages for poor farmers in the village before the wheat harvest. They said, "If it weren't for leaching salt, we wouldn't be able to get through before the wheat harvest." (Su Sanxi, Guo Huiyao, Liu Zhiying, Xu Xinzhu)

　　政府贷粮贷款
  　朱河村开展淋盐
    【北岳讯】正定五区朱河村在民主政府领导扶助下，淋盐业迅速发展。该村在去年解放后，曾有二十二户自动起来淋盐。后因正定城蒋匪一再窜扰，人心不安，陷于自流。今春经生产会议研究后，连去年的二十二户，共组织了三十一个小组，新辟淋池九个，晒池共有六十二个。各组由生产主任统一领导；弄土、淋水、晒盐都有专人负责。还有些人想要参加，但因缺乏工具吃粮，不能扩大。后经政府贷给四千斤小米，又继续组织了十三组。现全村共有四十五组，四十四个淋池，八十八个晒池。平均每天能出盐二千二百斤，可赚边币三百六十六万元。不少人的生活问题因此得到解决。六十多岁的成群老俩口和两个女儿欢喜的说：“去年咱出了三千斤盐，今年努点力，就能超过去年的一半，光景会更好”。还有不少人说：“旧社会时，想淋盐官家也不让淋，偷着淋一点，查住还受处罚；现在政府借给粮帮助淋，更应该好好的干”。现在每一淋池可以养十五个人。小盐生产已解决了全村贫苦农民的麦前吃粮。他们说：“要不是淋盐，麦前就过不去”。（苏三喜、郭辉耀、刘志英、许新珠）
