(Hebei-Shandong-Henan News) In order to implement the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee on restoring and developing communication work, the Propaganda Departments of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Ninth District Party Committees have issued notices, instructing all counties and districts to conscientiously carry out communication and reporting work. The Propaganda Department of the Fourth District Party Committee stated in its instructions: Some cadres lack a correct understanding of opposing "false reports" raised during the Party rectification, and therefore adopt a passive attitude towards communication work. Fearing the examination of "false reports," they simply don't write articles, thinking, "If I don't write, I can't make mistakes." Two decisions were made: (1) The heads of the propaganda departments of each county must take practical responsibility and regard communication and reporting as a regular and primary task of their department, starting with promoting the already determined correspondents. In counties where a head of the propaganda department has not yet been appointed, a Party committee member should be designated to truly and effectively serve as the head of the propaganda department. Each county committee, district committee, and correspondent should immediately start writing. In the future, the Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee will directly conduct inspections. (2) Reports should promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and on this basis, correct policies so that work does not deviate, or deviates less, overcoming the past "empty talk" style of emphasizing praise and not criticism, and one-sided exaggeration. The Propaganda Departments of the First, Second, Third, and Ninth District Party Committees have also recently issued instructions to various counties on restoring and developing communication work. The instructions from the First, Second, and Ninth District Party Committees stated: In the past, communication work was not considered important. From now on, its importance should be recognized from a political perspective, and communication and reporting work should be regarded as an important weapon in leadership. The instructions from the Ninth District Party Committee emphasized: County and district committees are required to take the initiative to take responsibility seriously and do a good job in communication work, and to earnestly arrange inspections. Each District Party Committee has instructed each county to appoint communication officers, requiring that communication work must be successful. The Ninth District Party Committee also proposed: For the convenience of the communication officer's work, they can work in the county office and organize the work reports and letters from each district into manuscripts. It is best to make two copies, one to be sent to the district committee branch and one to the newspaper office. After the original manuscript is revised, opinions are put forward and returned to the individual. This method of returning the manuscript can help the writer improve. If no one is making copies, the original manuscript can be sent to the branch, which will forward it to the newspaper office. The Propaganda Department of the First District Party Committee also decided that the communication officer, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, should regularly convene meetings to study, inspect, and summarize communication work. The Ninth District Party Committee emphasized: Write more; write about whatever you are doing; write as you speak, without being formal; one manuscript explains one thing; the original old correspondents should start writing first. The work of the county communication notices, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee, in addition to frequently contacting correspondents, carefully reviewing, registering, and forwarding manuscripts, must also regularly report the county's work situation and important issues in current work to the branch.

　　冀鲁豫各地委发出指示
    加强通讯报导工作
    【冀鲁豫讯】为执行区党委宣传部对恢复与开展通讯工作的指示，一、二、三、四、九各地委宣传部特发出通知，指示各县、区认真搞好通讯报导工作。四地委宣传部指示中说：有些干部对于整党中提出的反对“假报告”缺乏正确认识，因此对通讯工作抱消极态度，怕检查“假报告”，就干脆不写稿了，认为“我不写可不犯错了”。并作出两条决定：（一）各县宣传部长要切实负责，把通讯报导作为本部门经常的主要工作，首先从已确定的通讯员推动起。在尚没有配备宣传部长的县，应确定一个党委，名符其实的担任宣传部长。各县委、区委及通讯员，应立即动起笔来。今后地委宣传部要直接检查。（二）报导要发扬批评与自我批评的精神，在这个基础上端正政策，使工作不出偏向，或少出偏向，克服过去重表扬不批评，片面夸大的“客里空”作风。一、二、三、九等地委宣传部也在最近先后向各县发出恢复与发展通讯工作的指示，一、二、九地委指示中说：过去对通讯工作看得不重要，今后应从政治上来认识其重要性，应把通讯报导工作认为是领导上的重要武器。九地委指示中强调指出：县委、区委要求自动手认真负责，把通讯工作搞好，切实布置检查。各地委均指示各县配备通讯干事，要求务必把通讯工作作出成绩。九地委并提出：通讯干事为工作方便，可和县办公室一块办公，将各区工作报告、信件整理成稿件，最好复写两份，一份送地委支社，一份送报社。原稿经修改后，提出意见退回本人，这种退稿法能够帮助写稿人提高，如没人复写，可将原稿寄支社，由支社转报社。一地委宣传部并决定通讯干事在党委统一领导下，要经常的召集开会，研究、检查、总结通讯工作。九地委强调指出：要多写；作啥写啥；话怎样说就怎样写，不拘形式；一个稿说明一件事；原来的老通讯员要首先写起来。各县通讯启事的工作，按照区党委宣传部指示的精神，除去经常和通讯员连系，认真审阅、登记、转达稿件外，并要经常向分社汇报本县工作情况和当前工作中的重要问题。
