Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th -- The East China Jianghuai Military Region, separated from Nanjing by only the Yangtze River, was formally announced to be established last month on the 29th. The East China People's Liberation Army Command, in order to strengthen the struggle against the enemy in both areas and rapidly liberate all the people of Jianghuai, has specially merged the Huainan and Huaibei Military Sub-districts to form the Jianghuai Military Region. Chen Qingxian was appointed as Commander, Rao Zijian and Liang Congxue as Deputy Commanders, Cao Diqiu as Political Commissar, Yang Guangchi as Deputy Political Commissar and Director of the Political Department, and Zhao Huichuan as Chief of Staff, Zhang Lixiong as Deputy Director of the Political Department. The Jianghuai Military Region has jurisdiction over the area west of the Grand Canal, south of the Longhai Railway, and north of the Yangtze River, including parts of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, which is also the area where the former New Fourth Army's Second, Fourth, and Seventh Divisions operated during the War of Resistance Against Japan, including all of eastern and western Huainan Road, all of eastern Huaibei Road, and part of the Wanjiang area. The entire area covers more than 90,000 square kilometers and has a population of 10 million. This liberated area was arduously created by the New Fourth Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Countless national heroes shed blood and sweat here, leaving behind many commendable and moving heroic deeds. General Peng Xuefeng, commander of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army, gloriously sacrificed himself in 1944 in Yongcheng while fighting to save the anti-Japanese war situation in the Central Plains. After Japan surrendered in 1945, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to seek national peace and unity, exercised restraint and ordered the New Fourth Army to withdraw from the Wanjiang area. In July 1946, the full-scale civil war broke out. Under the Kuomintang army's frenzied attacks, the Jianghuai area was once entirely occupied by the enemy, and the people were subjected to mass killings and arrests by the Kuomintang army. However, in less than half a year, that is, at the end of 1946, parts of the People's Liberation Army under Generals Chen Qingxian and Cao Diqiu successively marched into the Huaibei and Huainan areas, led by Generals Rao Zijian and Yang Xiaochun, respectively. After half a year of hard fighting, they smashed the Kuomintang army's plans for "suppression," "encirclement and suppression," and "pursuit and suppression," and initially opened up the eastern Huaibei (Jinpu) Road area. In February 1947, General Yang Xiaochun again led his troops into eastern Huainan Jinpu Road, experiencing great hardships and opening up the Tianchang-Gaoyou area of Huainan. At the end of February this year, Generals Chen and Cao personally led a part of the East China Field Army into Huainan. By the time the Jianghuai Military Region was established, our army had recovered vast areas, liberated more than three million people, and established more than twenty county governments, and is gradually entering a new stage of full recovery.

　　在与南京一江之隔地带
    华东成立江淮军区
    现已解放人口三百万建立廿多民主县政府
    【新华社华东廿四日电】与南京仅有一江之隔的华东江淮军区，已于上月廿九日正式宣布成立华东人民解放军司令部为加强两地对敌斗争，迅速解放全江淮人民，特将淮南、淮北两军分区合并组成江淮军区；并任命陈庆先为司令员，饶子健、梁从学为副司令员，曹荻秋为政治委员，杨光池为副政治委员兼政治部主任，赵汇川为参谋长，张力雄为政治部副主任，江淮军区辖有运河以西，陇海路以南、长江以北之安徽省一部、江苏省一部，亦即在抗日战争时期原新四军二师、四师、七师所活动的淮南路东路西全部、淮北路东全部及皖江地区之一部。全区面积九万余方公里，人口一千万。该解放区原为新四军在抗日战争中所艰苦创建，无数民族英雄曾在此流血流汗，留下许多可歌可泣的丰功伟绩。新四军四师师长彭雪枫将军即于一九四四年为挽救中原抗日战局，奋战永城，而光荣殉国。一九四五年日本投降后，中共中央为求全国和平团结，实行忍让，令新四军撤出皖江地区。一九四六年七月全面内战爆发，在蒋军疯狂进攻下，江淮地区曾一时全陷敌手，人民横遭蒋军大量杀戮、逮捕。然为时不及半年，即一九四六年年底，陈庆先曹荻秋两将军所部解放军一部，即先后由饶子健、杨效椿两将军率领，分路挺进淮北、淮南地区，经半年苦战，粉碎蒋军“清剿”、“围剿”、“追剿”等计划，初步开辟了淮北（津浦）路东地区。一九四七年二月，杨效椿将军又率部挺进淮南津浦路东，历心艰苦，开辟了淮南天（长）、高（邮）地区。今年二月底，陈、曹两将军又亲率华东野战军一部进入淮南。至江淮军区成立时，我军已收复广大地区，解放人民三百余万，建立了二十余个县政权，并正逐渐步入全面恢复的新阶段。
