Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st: On the 23rd of last month, the People's Liberation Army advanced towards the Zhangqiu and Longshan areas. The Chiang Kai-shek troops, who had only occupied Zhangqiu and Longshan for a few days, fled west upon hearing the news. We immediately recovered the aforementioned areas and pursued the fleeing enemy. On the morning of the 24th, we completely routed the Chiang Kai-shek 73rd Division (15th and 77th Brigades), the 2nd Division's 213th Brigade, and security regiments that had gathered in Hancang, Wudian, Shilipu, Yushan, He'erzhuang, Zao Yuansi, Caojiapu, Fangjia Zhuang, Lüjia, and other places (all located 25 to 45 li east of Jinan). All of the aforementioned areas were captured by our army, and the remnants of the enemy fled towards Wangsherenzhuang and the areas west of it. Currently, our army's vanguard has directly approached the eastern suburbs of Jinan, an area 20 li away. According to preliminary statistics, over 1,000 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and 330 were captured alive. The spoils of war included one 60mm mortar, 28 light machine guns, 5 submachine guns, and 300 rifles and pistols.

Also, it has now been confirmed that among the prisoners captured during our capture of Zou County on the 15th of last month are Ge Ao, Deputy Commander of the 3rd Security Brigade of Shandong Province and Commander of the Zou County Defense, and Yu Yanling, a regimental commander with the rank of colonel, of the 2nd Regiment of the brigade, as well as many other enemy officers.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 2nd: The Mencius Temple and Mencius Mansion in Zou County have been almost completely destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Meng Zhaozeng, the 72nd generation descendant of Mencius, specifically accused Chiang Kai-shek's troops of their destructive crimes to the People's Liberation Army protecting the Mencius Temple on the day after the liberation of Zou County (June 16). According to him, after the Japanese surrender, Gong Zhenhuan, the Kuomintang County Magistrate of Zou County (who was killed by us in this battle), under the pretext of obstructing city defenses, ordered the complete demolition of Mencius' Mother's Former Residence, the spirit tablet of Mencius' Mother, the Pu Xiang Terrace where Mencius aired his books, the Ink Washing Pool, and the Zi Si Temple. The bricks and stones were used to build fortifications, and the pillars were used as firewood. At that time, Meng Fanji, the 74th generation descendant of Mencius and the official in charge of offering sacrifices at the Mencius Mansion, protested, but to no avail. Now, the Mencius Temple and the Mencius Mansion are desolate and completely different from their former appearance. Meng Zhaozeng said angrily, "They (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's troops) talk about respect and protection all the time, but this is what they do!" He praised the People's Liberation Army for taking great care of the Mencius Temple and other cultural relics, believing that the People's Liberation Army's words and deeds were consistent.

　　山东收复章邱龙山我军前锋直逼济南
    孟子后裔控诉蒋匪罪行
    【新华社华东前线一日电】解放军于上月二十三日向章邱、龙山地区进击，侵占章邱及龙山仅数日之蒋军闻风西窜，我当即收复上述两地，并跟踪追击逃敌。二十四日上午，我复将逃集韩仓、邬店、十里铺、虞山、合二庄、枣园寺、曹家铺、方家庄、吕家等地（均在济南以东二十五里至四十五里一线）之蒋军整七三师十五、七七两旅、整二师之二一三旅及保安团等部完全击溃，上述各地悉被我军攻占，残敌纷纷向王舍人庄及其以西地区溃逃。现我军前锋已直逼济南东郊二十里地区。据初步统计：是役共毙伤敌一千余名，生俘敌三百三十名；缴获六○炮一门，轻机枪二十八挺，冲锋枪五支，长短枪三百支。
    【又讯】上月十五日我攻克邹县城之役俘虏中，现已查明有山东省保安第三旅副旅长兼邹县城防司令葛鳌，该旅二团上校团喻延龄等敌军军官多人。
    【新华社华东前线二日电】邹县孟庙及孟府等文物古迹，已遭蒋军摧毁殆尽。孟子第七十二世孙孟昭增于此次邹县解放之次日（六月十六日），特向保护孟庙的解放军控诉蒋军破坏罪行。据称：日寇投降后，在此次战斗中为我击毙之国民党邹县县长巩震寰，即借口妨碍城防，下令将孟母三迁故居、孟母神位及孟子晒书的曝香台，洗砚池、子思庙等全部拆毁，将砖石修了工事，柱子当了柴烧。当时，孟府奉祀官孟子第七十四世孙孟繁骥曾提出抗议，但毫无效果。现孟庙及孟府满目荒芜，全非旧观。孟昭增愤愤的说：“他们（指蒋军）满口的尊重保护，就是如此！”他并盛赞解放军对孟庙等文物古迹爱护备至，认为解放军言行一致。
