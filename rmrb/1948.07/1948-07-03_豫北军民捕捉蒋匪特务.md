　　Yubei Military and Civilians Capture Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Spies

　　[Dispatch from this Newspaper] Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in northern Henan have continuously dispatched small groups of armed special agents to lurk in our border areas, attempting to carry out disintegration and sabotage activities, scout out military intelligence, and secretly threaten the masses to demand grain and money. Our battalion soldiers and militia, closely integrated with the masses, have actively launched a rigorous capture campaign. In Xiuwu, Ye County and other places, twenty plainclothes armed special agents have been captured successively. On the night of the 13th of this month, Chang Lanting, the captain of the 8th squadron of the puppet Wuzhi Security Regiment, dispatched his so-called "elite" special agent squad of ten men, combined with two enemy intelligence officers, to lurk in Gu Fan Village, the second district of Wuzhi, attempting to disintegrate the militia of our five villages, shoot our grassroots cadres in the dark, and threaten the masses to deliver grain and cloth. They failed to act on the 14th night, and were discovered by us on the morning of the 15th. The Xiuwu battalion soldiers immediately cooperated with the militia to search, and except for one person who escaped, all were captured. A total of nine special agents, including squad leader Zhao Nianshang, were captured alive, and six rifles, one American submachine gun, three pistols, more than 600 rounds of ammunition, and ten hand grenades were seized. The Xiuwu battalion soldiers also captured an enemy plainclothes special agent. It is said that recently, dozens of plainclothes special agents have been sent from the enemy strongholds of Jiaozuo Lifeng and Songcun, etc., disguised as coal merchants returning to their hometowns or feigning surrender, to gather our military intelligence. The armed work teams in various districts of Ye County have also captured many enemy plainclothes special agents. On the 14th of this month, a plainclothes special agent of the stubborn bandit Wang Ziquan's troops, disguised as a commoner, came to Cuijiaqiao Village to scout, and was recognized by the masses and arrested by our fourth district armed work team. On the same day, another enemy plainclothes agent was captured in Caoma. The armed work team of the second district disguised themselves, went deep into the enemy's rear, and lived with the masses. In eight days from May 28 to June 4, they captured five enemy plainclothes agents and killed two. The enemy Li Guobiao plainclothes team often fired in the dark in the Jurenwa area, which the masses hated very much. On the 18th of this month, five enemy plainclothes agents came to Jurenwa to carry out activities again, and our armed work team immediately captured three alive, seizing three pistols, fourteen bullets, and four hand grenades.

　　[Another Dispatch] During the wheat protection campaign in northern Henan, the morale of the stubborn bandit army is declining day by day under the combined offensive of our military and political forces. Often, as soon as the gunfire starts, they flee for their lives. During the Conggu battle east of Anyang, after our army launched a general offensive against the 117th Regiment of the enemy 40th Division, most of the soldiers fled without firing a shot. After the battle, more than half of the soldiers of that regiment deserted. In Xiaotun Village east of Anyang alone, seven young men who had been forcibly drafted into the regiment fled back overnight. During the Lijiashan battle, as soon as the soldiers of Wang Ziquan's bandit troops heard the gunfire, they turned around and ran. Some simply lay down and surrendered. North of Dingguo Temple, an enemy soldier was desperately trying to escape. When a soldier of our company shouted to surrender his gun, he immediately stopped, turned his hat around, raised his gun and said, "I understand your policy on prisoners." He obediently surrendered his gun. Two soldiers, while we were pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy, even turned their guns and shot at the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops with us. The wounded Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers, when our medical personnel changed their dressings, earnestly requested to be carried to the Liberated Army and not to return to Anyang to die. After Company × captured a heavy machine gun, there was no one to carry it, and several Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who had laid down their arms carried it back.

　　豫北军民捕捉蒋匪特务
    【本行讯】豫北蒋匪近日不断派出小股特务武装，潜伏我边沿区，企图进行瓦解破坏、侦探军情，并暗地威胁群众，逼要粮款。我营兵民兵密切结合群众，积极展开严密的捕捉战，修获武、邺县等地先后已捕获便衣武装特务二十名。本月十三日夜，伪武陟保安团第八中队队长常兰亭，派出其所谓“精干的”特务班十名，结合敌情报员两名，潜伏于武陟二区古樊村，企图瓦解我五个村的民兵、及打我基点干部黑枪，威胁群众送粮送布。十四夜未能下手，十五日上午被我发觉，修获武营兵立即配合民兵前去搜查，除一人逃跑外，全部落网。计活捉特务班长赵年上以下九名，缴获步枪六支，美式冲锋机枪一挺，手枪三支，子弹六百余发，手榴弹十个。修武营兵亦捕捉敌便衣特务一名。据称：近日焦作李封、宋村等敌据点，派出数十名便衣特务，伪装买煤商人返乡或假投降，刺探我方军情。邺县各区武工队亦捕捉了敌便衣特务多名。本月十四日顽匪王自全部一便衣特务，伪装老百姓到崔家桥村侦探，当被群众识破，由我四区武工队逮捕。同日又在曹马捕捉敌便衣一名。二区武工队化装深入敌后，和群众生活在一起，在五月二十八至六月四日八天内捉敌便衣五名，打死两名。敌李国标便衣队经常在举人洼一带打黑枪，群众异常痛恨，本月十八日敌便衣五名又到举人洼活动，我武工队当即活捉三名，缴获手枪三支，子弹十四粒，手榴弹四个。
    【又讯】豫北保麦战中，顽匪军在我军事与政治结合的攻势下，士气日益低落。常常枪声一响，即纷纷各自逃命。安阳东从固战斗时，敌四十师一一七团在我军发动总攻后，大部士兵不放枪即行溃逃。战斗后，该团士兵逃亡过半。仅安阳东小屯村被抓去编入该团的壮丁，一夜即逃回七个。李家山战斗时，王自全匪部士兵一听枪响，掉头就跑。有的干脆伏着就擒。在定国寺北，一个敌兵正拼命逃跑，我某连战士一喊缴枪，他立即站住，倒转帽，举过枪说：“我懂得你们的俘虏政策。”驯服的缴了枪。有两个士兵在我追歼逃敌时，曾掉过枪口和我一块射击溃逃的蒋顽匪军。负伤的蒋顽匪军士兵，在我军卫生员给换药时，都恳切要求把他们抬到解放军来，死不回安阳。×连在缴获重机枪后，没人抬，几个放下武器的蒋军就给抬回来。
