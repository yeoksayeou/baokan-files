(Chahar Electric) The Huailai County Party Committee, in accordance with the specific conditions of the four different regions in the county, has stipulated different priorities for leading production. In the six villages of Muzi Port, Longmen Gully, and Huangtuzui in the first district, there is a large amount of mountainous land and little cultivated land, with an average of only 1.6 mu per person. There is a large output of mountain products and medicinal materials. In this area, it is required to greatly develop animal husbandry, reclaim wasteland to grow vegetables, expand the cultivated land area, and make extensive use of slack seasons to cut mountain products (such as hoe handles, wolfberries, mountain willow, medicinal materials, and mountain walnuts), and systematically plant trees and afforest. In the western half of the first district, in the fifteen villages such as Huangluotuo and Luqingling, there is plenty of land but a lack of fertilizer, fuel, and water. The twenty-five villages in the second district have plenty of land, but the output is not high, and there is a shortage of fuel; grapes and fruits are abundant. In these two regions, intensive cultivation and careful farming are required, as well as the construction of flood discharge canals, in order to increase output; fruit trees and grapes should be planted, and the transportation industry should be developed. In the fourth and fifth districts, the front-line area, the environment is relatively turbulent, and the enemy frequently comes out to harass. This area produces a large number of fruits (such as the famous Huailai apples), and the general public can weave baskets. In this area, it is required to continue to eliminate fruit insects (this year's insect infestation is serious), develop sideline occupations, implement the combination of labor and military affairs, and breed fruit forests. In the ten villages of Zhuanghu and the southern five villages of the third district, red dates and vitex are abundant, and most people can weave baskets. In this area, it is required to develop weaving and promote the planting of dates and grapes. The current specific work that the county party committee has decided on is: (1) Mobilize all the masses to weed twice to ensure that they weed three times this year, and in some areas, they can weed four times. Those who lack seedlings should immediately plant them. (2) Eliminate wasteland and universally plant vegetables, buckwheat, and other late-maturing crops. (3) Truly grasp the disaster situation, establish the masses' ideology of overcoming famine through production, and make full use of grain and loan assistance to help the masses overcome the famine through production. (4) Carry out the green manure pressing movement to solve next year's fertilizer difficulties. Seize the gaps to build flood discharge canals. (5) Go deep into the guerrilla areas and marginal areas to understand the demands of the masses, help the masses produce, implement the combination of labor and military affairs, and protect the masses in production.

　　根据不同地区确定不同重点
  　怀来县委具体领导生产
    【察哈尔电】怀来县委按照县里四种不同地区的具体情况，规定领导生产的不同重点。一区木子港、龙门沟、黄土嘴等六村，山大地少，每人只平均一亩六分地，山货药材出产很多。在这种地区要求大量发展牧畜业、开荒种菜，扩大耕地面积，利用农闲大量砍山货（如镐柄、杞子、山柳、药材、山核桃），并有计划的植树造林。一区西半区黄骆驼、芦青岭等十五个村，地多缺肥、缺燃料、缺水。二区的二十五个村庄，地多而产量不高，缺燃料，盛产葡萄、果子。在这两种地区要求精耕细作，开修洪水渠，以提高产量；种植果树和葡萄，并发展运输事业。四、五区前方区一带，环境比较动荡，敌人经常出扰。该地出产大批水果（如驰名的怀来苹果），一般群众都会编筐。在这种地区要求继续消灭果虫（今年虫灾严重），发展副业，实行劳武结合，繁殖果林。一区庄户一带和三区南五村共十个村，盛产红枣、荆条，大部分人都会编筐。在这种地区要求发展编织，提倡种枣和葡萄。当前的具体工作，县委决定：（一）动员全体群众锄二遍，保证今年锄三遍，在部分地区还可锄四遍，缺苗者应立即点种。（二）消灭荒地，普遍种菜、荞麦等晚熟作物。（三）切实掌握灾情，树立群众的生产渡荒思想，充分利用贷粮贷款，帮助群众生产渡荒。（四）开展压绿肥运动，解决明年的肥料困难。抓住空隙开修洪水渠。（五）游击区与边缘区要深入下去，了解群众要求，帮助群众生产，实行劳武结合，掩护群众生产。
