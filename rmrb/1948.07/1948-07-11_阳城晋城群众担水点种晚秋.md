Urgent Mobilization to Combat Drought and Prepare for Famine!

　　【Taiyue News】Since the beginning of summer, many places in Taiyue have not had enough rain. Although the early autumn crops have been planted, replanting wheat fields with late autumn crops has become very difficult. This year, there are more replanted wheat fields (for example, in Yangcheng's first district, wheat fields account for six-tenths of all cultivated land). Therefore, drought prevention and rushing to plant have become urgent tasks for current agricultural production. The Taiyue Xinhua Daily published a short article on July 5, calling on farmers in various regions to further fight against the disaster. It stated: "As the saying goes: 'If the autumn harvest is not good, just look at the 26th,' today (July 5th) is already the 29th day of the fifth lunar month, and there has been no thorough rain. Many people are still waiting for rain to plant late autumn crops. If they miss the farming season, they will suffer great losses." The short article called on the masses in various regions to organize themselves to prevent drought, to carry water to plant if they can, and to open canals if they can, and not to delay matters by waiting for rain. It also pointed out: "The masses in our region have rich experience in fighting against disasters in the past. We must carry forward past experiences and fight against the disasters that have occurred, and prevent the formation of new famines." Many villages in Jincheng and Yangcheng have put forward the slogan "Defeat drought and prevent drought disaster," with men and women, old and young, working together to carry water and plant late autumn crops. Lichuan Village in Jincheng mobilized 858 full and semi-laborers to carry water to rush planting. In seven days, they planted 185 mu of corn, applying an average of 40 loads of manure per mu. In Yangcheng's Jiangli, Yangyi, and Liuchang villages, they started carrying water to plant on the 13th day of the fifth lunar month. According to statistics, about 1,000 men, women, and children participated. Men carried manure and water, while women and children dug holes and planted seeds. In more than ten days, they planted more than 2,000 mu of corn.

　　阳城晋城群众担水点种晚秋
    【太岳讯】入夏以来，太岳很多地方未落透雨，早秋虽已种上，但回茬麦地赶种晚秋，已发生了很大困难。今年回茬麦地又多（如阳城一区麦地占全耕地十分之六），因此防旱抢种，成为当前农业生产中的迫切任务。太岳新华日报于七月五日发表短论，号召各地农民进一步和灾害作斗争。据称：“常言道：‘秋收不收秋，单看二十六’，今天（七月五日）已是旧历五月二十九了，还没下透雨，不少群众还在等雨下种晚秋，如果错过农时，将会受到很大损失”。短论号召各地群众组织起来防旱，能担水点种的就点种，能开渠的就开渠，不要等雨误事。并指出：“我区群众和灾害作斗争，过去已有丰富的经验，要发扬过去经验和已发生的灾害作斗争，并预防新的灾荒的形成。”晋城、阳城不少村庄，已提出“战胜天旱，防止旱灾”的口号，男女老少一齐动手，担水点种晚秋。晋城犁川村动员了全半劳力八百五十八人担水抢种，七天点种玉茭一百八十五亩，每亩平均上到四十担粪。阳城匠礼、阳邑、留昌等村从阴历五月十三开始担水点种，统计有男人妇女儿童约一千多人参加，男人担粪担水，妇女儿童挖坑点籽，十多天功夫点种玉茭二千多亩。
