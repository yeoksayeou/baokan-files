　　Support the Wheat Protection Struggle in the Border Areas of Bo'ai and Other Places
  　Lingchuan Militia Returns Home Victoriously
    [Taihang Electric] The Lingchuan militia, who supported the struggle to protect wheat in the border areas of Bo'ai, Jiaozuo, and Wuzhi, have gloriously completed their mission and returned home victoriously after forty days of arduous combat assistance and harvesting. They engaged in a total of 53 battles, large and small, killing, wounding, and capturing 60 enemy bandits. They assisted the masses in production, contributing a total of 18,960 workdays. During the battles, they constantly received praise from the local masses and rewards from the government. The Xue Huaifu team, at Beiguanzhuang in Wuzhi, repelled grain-grabbing enemies who outnumbered them several times, killing two and wounding one, while covering the safe transfer of the masses. The county headquarters specially awarded them a bonus of 35,000 yuan in local currency (冀钞, Jì chāo, hereinafter the same). The Zhao Xiyin team, operating in the Shangtun area of Bo'ai, was known for its bravery and skill in battle, and was praised by the masses as the "Second Regiment" (the "Second Regiment" refers to the 772nd Regiment of the 386th Brigade of the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army, which fought in the Taihang Mountains at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. This regiment fought against the Japanese invaders and was invincible; everyone in the Taihang Mountains knew of it). They held a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other, helping the masses harvest and transport wheat on 356 mu during combat breaks, threshing 63 shi of wheat, and planting autumn crops on 37 mu. The Xue Huaifu team, operating in the Xiaozhuang area of Wuzhi, often assigned a squad to combat duty while the majority of the force helped the masses with quick harvesting, threshing, and storage. When they left, the masses were reluctant to part with them. In addition to combat and production, the Han Rantu team vigorously promoted the Outline Land Law, persuading many fugitive households to return home; eight families returned to Yangzhuang, Jiaozuo, in just one day. After forty days of training in the wheat protection struggle, the militia's combat effectiveness has improved. When the Zhao Xiyin team cooperated with the main force in attacking Beizhu Village, they independently blocked the enemy reinforcements from the east and west of Fengfeng, completing the task. When attacking Xifengfeng, the militiamen cooperated with the troops to enter the village and shouted to the enemy. The militia's fighting spirit remained high until they returned home victoriously.
