　　Gaocheng Businessmen Organize Factories
　　Nangong Adds 145 New Businesses
　　[Report from this newspaper] This spring, Gaocheng County originally had 3,539 industrial and commercial households. During the land reform, 89 households were mistakenly struggled against and sealed off. Since the implementation of the industrial and commercial policy and the correction of deviations, all but three households that are being corrected and five households that have not yet resumed business have resumed operations. Industrial and commercial businesses are being supported with the issuance of industrial and commercial loans of 22,551 million yuan (border currency). In the past six months, 94 new industrial and commercial businesses have been added in the city, its suburbs, and eight towns including Meihua and Zhuangnan. Sun Luofang, who started from scratch with seven family members and 29 mu of land, mainly earned income from oil pressing and cotton ginning. He was mistakenly struggled against, but after being restored, he actively sold sesame cakes to buy raw materials and started pressing oil again in February. He is a representative of the East Guan Commercial Firm and is very active in his work. Wang Binglin, the deputy director of the city's Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "Several shops were sealed up during the land reform, and merchants were a little panicked. After the quick correction, everyone felt at ease again. Last year, the burden was not very fair (it was estimated and determined), but now that everyone has seen the draft tax regulations (the draft interim simplified measures for industrial and commercial taxes issued by the Jizhong Administrative Office), their concerns have also been dispelled." The Li Sibai towel factory in Jiazhuang Village, District 3, was returned, and the bank provided a loan of 1.5 million yuan, so they immediately started weaving again. The Yumin small-scale match factory, which was directly assisted by the Industrial and Commercial Bureau, is now recruiting workers and inviting the masses to expand their share capital. Wang Enpu and Jin Zhensheng's silver company organized in Meihua Village, District 4, and Dong Jiying's soap factory organized in Nandong Village, District 10, are all actively planning.

　　藁城商民筹组工厂
    南宫增添坐商一百四十五家
    【本报讯】藁城县今春原有工商业三五三九户，在土改中错误地斗争、查封了八十九户。自从贯彻工商业政策，纠正偏向以来，除三户正在纠正，五户尚未复业外，其余已全部复业。实行扶助工商业，发放工商业贷款二万万二千五百五十一万元（边币）。半年来城关及美化、庄南等八个市镇，新增工商业九十四家。劳动起家的孙洛芳共七口人，有地廿九亩，主要收入是榨油轧花。他曾被错斗，退还以后积极的卖麻饼买原料，于二月又开始榨油。他担任东关商行代表，工作很积极。城内工商联合会副主任王丙林谈：“土改时封了几家门，商户有些恐慌，很快纠正以后，又都安心了。去年负担不大公道（是估计着定的），现在大家看了税收草案（冀中行署发的工商税暂行简易办法草案），顾虑也消了。”三区贾市庄退还了李四白毛巾厂，银行又给贷款一百五十万元，马上开始织起来。工商管理局直接帮助发展起来的裕民小型火柴厂，现正招收工人，邀集群众扩大股金。四区美化村王恩普、靳振声合股组织的银号，十区南董村董计英组织的肥皂工厂，都在积极筹划中。
