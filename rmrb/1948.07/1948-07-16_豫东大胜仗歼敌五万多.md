　　Great Victory in Eastern Henan: Over 50,000 Enemies Annihilated
    (For mass blackboard and rooftop broadcasts)
    The victory of our East China and Central Plains People's Liberation Army in eastern Henan has further expanded. From the 27th of last month to the 6th of this month, in just over ten days, in the Sui County and Qi County areas of eastern Henan, over 50,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops were annihilated, and many officers above the rank of brigadier general were captured alive. Those already identified include Qiu Shou-nian, Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the Sixth Pacification Zone and Commander of the Army Corps, and eight others. There are still some who have not been identified. In this campaign, Chiang Kai-shek frantically mobilized troops for reinforcements, but in the end, they could not escape the great net cast by our powerful People's Liberation Army.

　　豫东大胜仗歼敌五万多
    （供大众黑板屋顶广播用）
    我华东和中原人民解放军在豫东的胜利更加扩大了。从上月廿七号到本月六号十来天功夫，在豫东睢县、＠县地区，歼灭蒋敌共五万多人，活捉旅以上军官好多个，已经查明的有第六绥靖区中将副司令官兼兵团司令区寿年等九名，还有没清查出来的。在这一战役里，蒋介石手忙脚乱调兵援救，但结果却逃不出我强大解放军撒下的大网。
