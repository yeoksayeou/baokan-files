Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th. A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army is conducting political study and ideological review. On the basis of raising the political consciousness of the soldiers, a movement to examine cadres, evaluate merits, and record demerits is also being carried out. At the beginning of the movement, the soldiers were afraid of losing face by revealing their bad thoughts. Therefore, the leading organs adopted the approach of first examining good examples and using these to educate the soldiers, raise their class consciousness, and then launch a general review. Wang Huiwa, a liberated soldier, was active and brave in the Jingwei battle. During the capture of Baoji, he did not even visit his brother, who had lived in the city for many years, in order to focus on his work. In analyzing his own thoughts, he said: "I am a poor man. I suffered enough oppression in the Kuomintang. When I came to the People's Liberation Army, it was like finding a home. To help the poor people to turn over, it is only in difficult environments that we are truly serving the people." Among the good examples, the leading organs encouraged the soldiers to compare the good examples with their own thoughts and conduct self-examination. As a result, those with shortcomings requested to examine themselves first, and a general review naturally unfolded. In the general review, the examination of cadres, evaluation of merits, and recording of demerits were further carried out. Xue Yingcai, a combat hero of the Tenth Company, became arrogant and conceited after being promoted to platoon leader due to his own lack of political progress. He showed timidity and fear of death in the battle of @邑. After everyone exposed and criticized his mistakes, Xue sincerely accepted everyone's opinions and expressed his determination to atone for his sins by performing meritorious service in future battles. Li Zhensheng, the squad leader of the Fourth Squad of the Ninth Company, was demoted from platoon leader to squad leader last year due to weak fighting will during the "three checks" campaign. He then resolved to correct his mistakes. During pre-war training, he led the best ideological study performance. After that, he personally observed the terrain and selected firepower points in every battle. In one mission to resist the enemy, he used only 330 rounds of ammunition to complete the cover mission. In continuous combat marches, he set an example by doing extra public service and was very concerned about the lives of all the soldiers in the squad. Everyone unanimously believed that he had made great contributions and proposed that the higher authorities restore his original position. The higher authorities then restored his original position based on everyone's opinions.

　　西北某部进行查思想政治学习
  　有功的受到表扬有过的决心改过
    【新华社西北十六日电】西北解放军某部进行查思想的政治学习。并在战士提高政治觉悟的基础上，进行查干部评功记过运动。运动开始时，战士们怕讲出坏思想丢人。因此领导机关便采取先查好的典型，并由此教育战士，提高其阶级觉悟，再展开普查。解放战士王辉娃在泾渭战斗中积极勇敢；克宝鸡时，为了工作，连分别多年住在城里的哥哥都没有去探望一下。在分析他自己的思想时，他说：“我是穷人，在国民党里受压迫受够了，到了解放军，如同找到了家，为穷人翻身，在艰苦环境下才是真正替人民办事的时候。”查好的典型中，领导机关启发战士们将好的典型和自己的思想对比，进行检讨。于是有缺点的人都要求先查自己，因而很自然的展开了普查。在普查中进一步进行查干部评功记过。十连战斗英雄薛英才，自升为排长后，由于自己政治上不进步，便骄傲自大；在＠邑战斗中表现畏缩怕死。经大家对他的错误揭露并批评后，薛诚恳接受了大家意见，并表示决心在以后战斗中立功赎罪。九中队四班长李振声，去年三查因战斗意志薄弱，由排长降为班长后，即决心改正错误。战前练兵时，他领导的思想学习成绩最佳。以后每次战斗他都亲自观察地形，选择火力点。某次执行抗击任务时，只用了三百卅发子弹，完成了掩护任务。在连续战斗行军中，以身作则多出公差，并非常关心全班战士的生活。大家一致认为他功劳大，提议要求上级恢复他的原职。上级当根据大家意见恢复他的原职。
