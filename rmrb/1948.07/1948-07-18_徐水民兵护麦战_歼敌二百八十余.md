[Chahar News] The Xushui militia and working teams armed to protect the wheat harvest have successively annihilated over two hundred and eighty-seven enemies. Before the wheat harvest, the county made thorough preparations for protecting the wheat. Cadres were assigned tasks, demarcating joint defense areas. Committees for protecting the wheat harvest were organized at the district, village, and joint defense area levels. County and district cadres personally led the militia, covering the masses' wheat harvest, and engaging the enemy in village battles and mine warfare. From June 10th to the 22nd, in thirteen days, they repelled several enemy intrusions in places like Xibaiting, Nanzhuangtou, Shuangying, and Shili Pu. The militia fought independently twenty-two times, killing thirty-nine enemies, wounding sixty-two, capturing one alive, and accepting the surrender of forty-four Chiang Kai-shek/Fu Zuoyi soldiers. Mines killed fourteen enemies and wounded thirty-one enemy officers, including a company commander. Cooperating in battle three times, they killed twenty enemies and captured seventy-six, totaling two hundred and eighty-seven enemies killed, wounded, or captured. The militia independently seized fifteen rifles. In cooperation, they captured one heavy machine gun, five light machine guns, forty rifles, and destroyed three armored vehicles and one automobile.

[Chahar Telegram] Over the past six months, the Xushui militia has actively fought, continuously severing the section of the Pinghan Railway north of Baoding to Gucheng and methodically annihilating small groups of enemies.
