Jinzhong Frontline Dispatch

At two o'clock on the night of July 12th, during the general attack on Tai Gu Da Chang Town against Zhao Chengshou’s troops of the Yan Faction, it was drizzling, and the darkness was impenetrable. Comrade Li Jirong, the squad leader of the second squad of the fifth company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, was leading a grenade throwing team, searching forward along the main street when he suddenly noticed a dark figure ahead. He asked, "Which unit are you from?" The dark figure remained still and asked in return, "Which unit are you from?" "One-zero-nine." The fellow vaguely heard "Two-one-nine" and mistakenly thought they were his own people, replying, "I am also from the 'Two-one-nine' unit." Squad Leader Li knew he had misheard, so he ordered him to come over, clapping his hands. When he approached, Comrade Zhang Wenqing saw that he was wearing a hat with a red circle and secretly told the squad leader, "It's the enemy!" Squad Leader Li quickly signaled him not to shoot, and at the same time, noticing that he was carrying a backpack, knew that he was trying to escape. Squad Leader Li immediately devised a plan, pretending to say to him, "Are there any more people? Go back and make contact. We are all on the same side and should leave together." The enemy completely believed him. "Okay! I'll go back and make contact. Don't misunderstand, we are on the same side!" He turned around and went back. Squad Leader Li and the others followed closely behind, watching him enter a gate. They ambushed themselves on both sides of the gate, and the others in the squad rushed up and hid behind the wheat stack opposite the gate. After a short pause, the enemy suddenly came out. Squad Leader Li and the others used bayonets to force them to surrender. However, the enemy was still dreaming, complaining, "Giving my gun to my own people, what will happen if I encounter the enemy?" "Hurry up and surrender your gun! They are the enemy over there." As he said this, they dragged them one by one to the back. The enemy inside, still in groups of three or five, continued to pour out. As soon as they reached the gate, Squad Leader Li unexpectedly snatched their weapons, grabbed their necks, and dragged them behind the wheat stack. In this way, they captured forty or fifty people silently without the enemy noticing. Later, when more than a dozen enemies came out, they realized that there was an ambush at the gate, but those in front had already rushed to the gate, still confused and self-persuading, "What time is it? You haven't given your gun to them yet." They also automatically surrendered their guns. Those in the back saw that something was wrong and ran back. Squad Leader Li, holding the machine gun he had just seized, chased into the courtyard and eliminated more than a dozen fellows who were trying to escape. At this time, comrades from one platoon all squeezed into the courtyard. Squad Leader Li and the others handed over the prisoners to them, took them to the back, and then led the comrades of the second squad into the house. They saw that there were still more than twenty enemies sleeping soundly. Everyone guarded the door and shouted, "Wake up! Others have already surrendered, and you are still sleeping. Get up!" A room full of enemies, without saying a word, were taken prisoner in a daze.

  　晋中前线通讯
    七月十二日夜两点钟，总攻太谷大常镇阎匪赵承绶部的战斗中，天下着小雨，阴得黑洞洞的。人民解放军某部五连二班长李集荣同志，带着投弹组，正顺着大街向前搜索，突然发现前面有个黑影，便问道“那一部分？”对面的黑影不动了，反问“你是那一部分？”“一零九。”这家伙模模糊糊的听象“二一九”，竟以为是自己人，又答道：“我也是‘二一九’部”，李班长知道他听错了，就命他拍着手过来，走到身边时，张文庆同志看见他戴着红圈帽子，就偷偷的告诉班长说：“是敌人！”李班长忙示意他不要打，同时，发现他背着背包，知道他是想要逃跑。李班长马上计上心来，故意对他说：“还有什么人，回去联络一下，咱们都是自己人，要走一块走。”敌人竟完全相信。“好！我回去联络去，自己人可不要误会呀！”说着，转身就回去了。李班长等，紧跟在后面，看他进了一个大门，他们几个就埋伏在大门两侧，班里的其他人忙赶上来，藏在大门对面的麦垛后面，稍停，忽然敌人从里面出来，李班长等就用刺刀逼住缴枪。可是，敌人还在做梦一样，埋怨着说：“自己人枪缴给你，碰见敌人看怎么办？”“赶快缴枪吧！那里是敌人。”说着，一个个都拖到后面去了。里面的敌人，还是三五成群的向外涌，一到门口，李班长就冷不防的夺过敌人武器，抓着脖子，拖到麦垛后面，这样不声不响的接连捉了四五十个，敌人都没发觉。后来，又出来十几个敌人时，才知道门口埋伏有人，但前面的已经闯到大门跟前，还迷迷糊糊的自行劝告的说：“到什么时候了，枪还不给人家。”也自动缴了枪，后面看了不对头，就朝回跑。李班长端着刚缴来的机枪，追到院子里，又把十几个想逃跑的家伙解决了。这时，一排同志都挤进院子来了。李班长等把俘虏交给他们，往后面带走后，又带着二班同志，冲进房子里一看，还有二十多个敌人在睡大觉呢。大家把住门，就大呼起来：“醒醒吧！人家都缴了枪，你们还睡觉哩。起来！”一屋子敌人，连话都没说，糊里糊涂的都作了俘虏。
