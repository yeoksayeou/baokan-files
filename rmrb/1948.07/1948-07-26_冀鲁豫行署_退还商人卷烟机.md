Jilu Yu Administrative Office
　　Returns Cigarette Machine to Merchant
    [Jilu Yu Dispatch] When the Fourth Administrative Office of Jilu Yu recovered Changyuan, it valued a cigarette machine belonging to a merchant in the city at 3.5 million yuan (Jilu currency, same below) and entered into a joint operation with the merchant for the production of the organization. At that time, the merchant was unaware of our policy of protecting industry and commerce and had no choice but to do so, but he was not entirely comfortable and did not dare to speak out. Later, the administrative office centrally managed the cigarette business and, unaware of the true situation, transported the cigarette machine for its own use. Later, it was discovered that there were private shares involved. According to our party's policy of protecting industry and commerce, it should be returned. The administrative office has conducted self-criticism, returned the machine, and wrote a letter to the Jilu Yu Daily, explaining the handling process: The Fourth Administrative Office's forceful valuation of this cigarette machine to enter into a joint operation with the merchant violated the policy of protecting industry and commerce. When the administrative office centrally managed the cigarette business, it did not discover the private shares beforehand, and transporting the cigarette machine over was a mistake on top of a mistake. The leadership of the administrative office discovered this policy violation and immediately decided to return the cigarette machine to its original owner, and instructed comrades Meng Jingzhi and others to be responsible for investigation and handling. The original owner initially had some concerns in his mind, expressing a willingness to sell the machine at a discounted price. After our repeated explanation of the industrial and commercial policy, we firmly returned the original object and instructed our subordinates not to disassemble any parts on the machine. The machine was returned by the original owner on June 6.

　　冀鲁豫行署
  　退还商人卷烟机
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫四专署在收复长垣时，曾将该城商人一部卷烟机折价三百五十万元（冀钞，下同）和商人合伙经营机关生产。当时该商人不明我之保护工商业政策，亦只得这样干，但心里不算十分舒服，亦不敢说出。后行署集中经营卷烟事业，不明其中真象，又将该卷烟机运走使用。后发觉其中有私人股份，按我党保护工商业政策，应予退还，行署已做自我检讨，退还了机器，并给冀鲁豫日报写信，说明处理经过称：四专署强使这部卷烟机作价，与商人合伙经营机关生产，实违犯了保护工商业政策，而在行署集中经营卷烟事业时，事先未发觉有私人股份，又把卷烟机接运过来，更是错上加错。行署领导上发现了这种违犯政策的行为，立即决定把卷烟机退还原主，并让孟静之等同志负责调查处理。原主最初在思想上仍有若干顾虑，表示愿将该机折价出售。经我反复解释工商业政策，坚决退还原物，并指示所属不准拆动机器上任何零件。该机已于六月六日由原主运回。
