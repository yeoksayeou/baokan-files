　　North Yue News: The Hu Jia Zhuang village cooperative in Wutai had considerable success in the past leading the masses in sideline production. It helped the entire village earn enough to acquire three 46-yarn spinning machines, wind bow frames, two iron weaving machines, two towel machines, one sock machine, and 35 spinning wheels, resolving the difficulties of many poor households and earning the support of the entire village. During the land reform last year, the widespread practice of "moving stones" caused the cooperative's cadres to cease their work. Last year's severe drought resulted in crop failure in the village, and this year, 103 out of the village's 976 people went hungry. Poor households repeatedly requested the restoration of the cooperative, but the cooperative cadres were concerned about "moving stones" and did not dare to lead. Seeing this situation, the village branch immediately led a Party group meeting to resolve the issue. Both past and present Party cadres made self-criticisms. The branch leadership first criticized the "moving stones" that had occurred in the village in the past, admitting that some were done incorrectly, and apologized to the comrades who had been wronged, hoping they would continue to work well. The Party cadres of the cooperative also criticized their own shortcomings, clarifying right and wrong. Once the problem was resolved, everyone's spirits lifted, and the cooperative was restored. They began by organizing 17 people to spin yarn, producing 70 jin in a month, earning a profit of 1.68 million yuan (border region currency, same below). At the same time, they wove 11 bolts of cloth and two dozen towels. The cooperative also organized two households that raised donkeys to engage in transportation and sales, earning 120,000 yuan per day. To expand weaving, they organized two carpenters to make spinning wheels, already earning 660,000 yuan. Under the organization and leadership of the village cooperative, the difficulties of some of the masses have been resolved.

　　支部领导检讨打破党员顾虑
  　胡家庄合作社恢复
    【北岳讯】五台胡家庄村合作社，过去领导群众副业生产，就有相当成绩。帮助全村赚置四六纱机三架、风弓架、织布铁机两架、手巾机两架、袜机一架、纺车三十五架，解决了不少贫苦户的困难，得到了全村群众的拥护。去年土改时普遍搬石头，合作社的干部也停止了工作。去年旱灾严重，该村歉收，今年全村九百七十六口人中，有一百零三口饿肚子。贫苦户几次要求恢复合作社，但合作社干部存在着“搬石头”的顾虑，始终不敢起来领导。村支部看到这种情形，即领导召开党的小组会解决这个问题。过去与现在的党员干部都作了检讨，支部领导同志首先检讨了村里过去搬石头，有的搬错了，今天向搬错的同志赔个不是，希望他们继续好好工作。合作社的党员干部也检讨了自己的毛病，分清是非，问题得到解决，大家的情绪转过来，合作社恢复了。开始组织一十七人纺线，一个月纺出七十斤，获利一百六十八万元（边币，下同），同时织布十一匹、手巾两打。合作社还组织了两户喂毛驴的做运销，每天可赚十二万元。为开展纺织，组织了两个木匠制纺车，已获利六十六万元。在村社的组织领导下，一部分群众的困难已获解决。
