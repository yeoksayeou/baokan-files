　　"The Central Army's fighting skills are either killing or money"
  　The enemy 83rd Division suffered heavy casualties in Eastern Henan
    【Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, 23rd】During the Eastern Henan Campaign, the Chiang army's 83rd Division, attempting to reinforce the Qu Shou Nian corps from the east, was severely attacked by the People's Liberation Army near the Huiji River east of Qi County, suffering heavy casualties. Many soldiers defected to the People's Liberation Army's positions. A certain regiment received twenty-three defectors within two days. Chen Jinyou, a second-class private from the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 189th Regiment, said: "The 189th Regiment is finished this time. The regimental commander was wounded, the 2nd battalion commander was killed, the 1st battalion commander was wounded, and seven or eight company commanders were wounded. So the 1st battalion was reorganized into one company and one platoon. The whole regiment only has three infantry companies and one machine gun company." Guo Yinyou, a sergeant squad leader from the 187th Regiment headquarters' horse unit, said: "I have been in the Central Army for six years, and I know their fighting skills. It's either killing or money. This time, before the first day of battle, the regimental commander said to his subordinates: 'Chiang Kai-shek's order is that whoever fails to attack will be dismissed and executed.' The next day, before the attack, the regimental commander said again: 'Chiang Kai-shek ordered that the unit that first establishes contact with the 75th Division will be given 5 million yuan per person.' But they still couldn't attack!" Xing Changyun, a sergeant squad leader from the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, 189th Regiment, who defected with a machine gun, also said: "Yesterday I saw a squad leader from the 1st Company who was shot for refusing to charge. Yesterday, in just one regiment, six people were executed."

　　“中央军的打仗本事不是杀头就是票子”
  　敌八十三师在豫东伤亡惨重
    【新华社豫东前线二十三日电】豫东战役中，妄图东援区寿年兵团的蒋军整八十三师，在杞县东惠济河边遭解放军痛击，伤亡惨重，许多士兵纷纷跑到解放军阵地投诚。某团两天内即收容了二十三人。该师一八九团二营四连二等兵陈金友说：“一八九团这次算光了，团长打伤，二营营长打死，一营营长打伤，连长打伤了七、八个。于是一营编成一个连、一个排，全团就只有三个步兵连，一个机枪连。”一八七团部马号中士班长郭引犹说：“我在中央军已干了六年，他们打仗的本事我知道，不是杀头就是票子。这次第一天作战前，团长对下面讲话说：‘蒋委员长的命令，谁要攻不动，谁就撤职杀头。’第二天攻击前，团长又说：‘蒋委员长命令，那个部队先和七十五师打通联系，每人给伍百万元。’但是还是攻不动！”携带机枪投诚的一八九团一营二连中士班长邢昌云也说：“昨天我见一连一个班长，因不肯冲锋被枪毙了。昨天光一个团，就枪毙了六人”。
