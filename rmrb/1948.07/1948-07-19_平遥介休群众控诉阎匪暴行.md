Taiyue News: After the People's Liberation Army recovered the broad areas of Pingyao and Jiexiu, local people have been actively accusing the Yan faction of bloody atrocities to the People's Liberation Army. An old man surnamed Li in Xiquan Village, who was over sixty years old, was robbed clean by the Yan bandits in May. Because he had nothing to eat, he went to his field to cut some wheat. Just as he was about to cook it, he was caught by the Yan army. They dragged the old man out and beheaded him with a guillotine, hanging his head on the east gate, threatening everyone, "Whoever dares to cut wheat privately will have his head guillotined." The masses said that thankfully the People's Liberation Army had arrived, otherwise they wouldn't be able to eat a single grain of wheat. The people of Caocun village complained that they were not living like human beings, and could be killed at any time. Cao Baoyu from his village went to Pingyao city to buy medicine for his sick mother. He was checked by the Yan bandits, and because he did not have the three certificates (namely, a travel permit, a national ID card, and a unified organization certificate), he was brutally murdered. Later, his younger brother, Xiao Bao, went to claim the body, and was falsely accused of scouting for information and detained as a conscript. His mother died of grief, and his father hanged himself. Now there are only two women left with no one to support them. A folk song is popular in the area: "Yan Xishan is a killing fiend, making it impossible for the people to live, making women without men." The puppet county government robbed 150 shi of wheat from Jia Village, and the people complained bitterly. The puppet government said, "We will no longer ask Jia Village for grain." Then the "Love the Homeland Corps" and "Security Police Team" came to demand grain, grass, fodder, and flour. What they took was never enough to satisfy them. Once, when the enemy came to demand grain, villager Zhao Shili was in the vegetable garden. The Yan bandits grabbed him and said, "If you are a good person, why are you running to the vegetable garden?" They beat him up and fined him four shi of wheat.

　　平遥介休群众控诉阎匪暴行
    【太岳讯】解放军收复平遥、介休广大地区后，当地人民纷纷向解放军控诉阎匪的血腥暴行。西泉村有个六十多岁的李老汉，五月间被阎匪抢光了。因为没吃的，就去自己地里割了点麦子，正准备下锅时，被阎匪军碰到，把老汉捉出去用铡刀铡死，把头挂在东门上，威胁大家说：“谁要私自割麦，就要铡谁的头”。群众说幸亏解放军来了，要不一颗麦子也吃不上。曹村老百姓诉说他们过的完全不是人的生活，随时都会被害。他村有个曹保玉，因母亲有病，去平遥城买药，被阎匪查住，他没有推带三证（就是路条证、国民身份证，统一编组证），惨遭杀害。后他弟弟小保去领尸，又被诬为打探消息，扣住当了常备兵。他母亲气死了，父亲上吊死了，现只剩下两个女人无人养活。当地流行着这样一种民谣：“阎锡山是杀人精，害得老百姓活不成，害得女人无男人。”伪县府在贾村抢了一百五十石麦子，老百姓叫苦连天，伪政府说：“再不和贾村要粮了”。随后“爱乡团”、“保警队”就来要粮、要草、要料、要面，打下的完全给他们还不够。有一次敌人来要粮，村民赵士立正在菜园里，阎匪抓住他说：“你是好人为啥往菜园跑。”打了一顿，还罚了四石麦子。
