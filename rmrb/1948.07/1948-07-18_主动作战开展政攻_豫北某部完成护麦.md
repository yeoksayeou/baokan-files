【Taihang Telegram】During the wheat protection battle in northern Henan, a local armed unit took the initiative in combat, launched a political offensive, and assisted the people in harvesting wheat and sowing seeds, successfully completing the wheat protection task and expanding the political influence of our Party and our army. After receiving the wheat protection mission, the unit, under the slogan of "strike first," combined with fraternal units on May 27 to attack the Zhu Village stronghold north of Bo'ai County for the first time. On May 29, it also defeated over a thousand Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were looting grain in Nie Village, Wuzhi County, disrupting the enemy's grain-looting deployment. Later, it repelled the grain-looting enemy twice in Xiaoshang and Shaqiupu, forcing the enemy back to its stronghold, preventing them from coming out, and enabling the masses of Bo'ai to successfully complete the wheat harvest. Recently, the unit summarized its achievements from May 27 to June 26, capturing six regular enemy soldiers, wounding seventy bandits, killing thirty-two bandits below the rank of staff officer and company commander, and seizing one radio. In the intervals between battles, they helped the masses harvest 236 mu of wheat, carry 24 mu of wheat, thresh 160 times, carry water and sow 168 mu, help the masses store grain four times, and carry 462 shi of wheat. At the same time, they launched a political offensive, writing slogans everywhere, distributing leaflets, holding mass meetings and small-scale forums for the masses in the Chiang-controlled areas, disintegrating thirty-one returned enemy puppet soldiers, and enabling fleeing households to return to their villages one after another. An old man selling coal in Lifeng said: "The Eighth Route Army's slogans and leaflets were posted at the gate of the Lifeng puppet county government, and the stubborn army dared not call out or in for three days." The masses were extremely excited, and the landlords in the Chiang-controlled areas also said: "When the Eighth Route Army was here, we only had to pay grain once a year, and there was always a way; when the stubborn army comes, there is no limit to what they want. If we bake some cakes, they grab them and eat them when they see them. The Eighth Route Army should come in quickly and kill all those whores (stubborn army)."
    【Ji-Lu-Yu News】In the wheat protection operations in Wenshang County in June, the enemy was wounded sixteen times, two enemies were killed, fifteen enemies were captured (including one platoon leader), thirteen long and short guns were seized, more than 600 rounds of ammunition were seized, and more than 500 jin of wire were seized. 157 secret agents and returned home defense corps members and more than 60 puppet organization personnel were won over and disintegrated.
    The Armed Forces Department of the Seventh Sub-district Command of Ji-Lu-Yu issued a special circular commending the militia work teams in the county, stating: "After the party rectification and military consolidation, all commanders and fighters of the militia work team in the district have established the determination to serve the people. They have been active and proactive day and night, striving for the initiative in military affairs, ensuring the progress of disintegration work, and achieving great victories; it is worth learning from the militia work teams and cadres in various places, and this circular is hereby issued for commendation, and it is hoped that the militia work team will make persistent efforts to achieve more and greater victories in the future."
