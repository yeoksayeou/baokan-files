　　The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPC) was formed in December 1920 after a nationwide general strike, composed of revolutionary elements from the then Social Democratic Party. In the last pre-war election in 1935, the CPC received 850,000 votes, taking 30 seats in the 300-seat parliament, making it the fourth largest party in the country. Before Czechoslovakia was betrayed to Hitler, the CPC had only 60,000 members. Before the war, the CPC was the only party that firmly fought against the Munich policy (Note: In September 1938, the heads of state of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy met in Munich, southern Germany, and stipulated that the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia be ceded to Germany. This was the so-called "appeasement" policy of British and French imperialism, sacrificing Czechoslovakia to encourage Hitler to attack the Soviet Union); during the war, it was the leader and organizer of the people's liberation movement; after the war, it was the leader and organizer of the new democratic regime and construction. Therefore, it enjoys extremely high prestige among the people. During the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Hitler's Germany, the CPC worked entirely underground, and 25,000 outstanding party members gloriously sacrificed themselves for the independence and freedom of the motherland, including 42 members of the Central Committee. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia on May 9, 1945, the CPC's organization developed rapidly. In the three months after liberation, its membership increased to 500,000; a year later, the number of members exceeded one million. In May 1946, in the first post-war election, the CPC won 38 percent of the total votes, becoming the largest party in the parliament; CPC Chairman Klement Gottwald also formed a new government of the National Front. From the end of 1946 to the spring of 1947, the CPC carried out a comprehensive party consolidation: the work and style of each party member were checked, those who violated party discipline were expelled, and new party membership cards were issued. After the Czechoslovak people victoriously suppressed the reactionary traitorous incident in February this year, the CPC's political prestige increased unprecedentedly, and when the new constitution was announced on May 9, its total membership reached 2,048,000. In the May 30 election, the National Front led by the CPC won 89.2 percent of the votes, occupying 293 of the 300 seats in the parliament, of which the CPC occupied 160 seats. The Chairman of the Central Committee of the CPC is the current President Klement Gottwald, and the General Secretary is Rudolf Slánský.

　　捷克共产党
    捷克共产党产生于一九二○年十二月全国总罢工之后，由当时社会民主党中的革命分子所组成。在一九三五年战前最后一次的选举中，捷共得票八十五万，在国会三百议席中占三十席，为全国第四大党。在捷克被出卖给希特勒之前，捷共只有党员六万人。在战前，捷共是始终坚决打击慕尼黑政策的唯一政党（按一九三八年九月英法德意四国首脑在德国南部慕尼黑开会，会上规定将捷克苏台德区割给德国，这是英法帝国主义牺牲捷克以鼓励希特勒进攻苏联的所谓“绥靖”政策）；在战争中，它是人民解放运动的领导者与组织者；在战后，它是新民主政权与建设的领导者和组织者。因此，它在人民群众中的威信极高。在希特勒德国占领捷克期间，捷共是完全在地下工作的，它曾为祖国的独立自由光荣地牺牲了二万五千名优秀党员，其中有四十二名是中央委员。一九四五年五月九日捷克解放以后，捷共的组织以飞跃的速度向前发展。解放后的三个月，它的党员增至五十万；一年以后，党员数目超过一百万。一九四六年五月，捷共在战后第一次选举中获得全部选票的百分之三十八，成为国会中最大的政党；捷共主席哥特瓦尔德亦出组人民民主阵线的新政府。一九四六年年底至一九四七年春，捷共曾经实行过一次全面的整党：每个党员的工作与作风都经过检查，开除了违犯党纪的分子，颁发了新党证。今年二月捷克人民胜利地镇压了反动派叛国事件以后，捷共的政治威信空前增涨，五月九日新宪法宣布时，它的党员总数已达二百零四万八千人。在五月三十日的选举中，捷共所领导的民族阵线得票百分之八十九点二，在国会三百议席中占二百九十三席，捷共在其中占一百六十席。捷共中央委员会主席为现任总统哥特瓦尔德，总书记为斯朗斯基。
