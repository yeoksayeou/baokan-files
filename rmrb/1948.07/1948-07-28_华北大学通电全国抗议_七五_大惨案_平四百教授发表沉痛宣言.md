Xinhua News Agency, North China, July 24th: Recently, North China University, expanded from the merger of North China United University and Northern University, with over two thousand teachers and students, telegraphed the All-China Student Federation, cultural circles, and compatriots from all walks of life, protesting the Jiang-Fu bandit gang's crime of shooting and killing students from Northeast China in Beiping. They also welcomed students and educators from cultural circles across Beiping, Tianjin, and the entire country oppressed by the Jiang bandits to come to the Liberated Areas to study and participate in the various tasks of building a new China. The telegram was led by Principal Wu Yuzhang, Vice Principals Fan Wenlan, Cheng Fangwu, and Dean of Studies Qian Junrui. The telegram stated: The "July 5th" massacre most fully and typically demonstrated how the reactionary ruling group of Chiang Kai-shek, under the instigation and support of American imperialism, hung the sheep's head of democratic constitutionalism while selling the dog meat of bloody fascist terror rule. History tells people that any reactionary ruler's brutal suppression of the masses can only demonstrate that their rule is on the verge of destruction. The "March 18th" massacre twenty-two years ago was a prelude to the total collapse of the Northern Warlords a year later, and the "July 5th" massacre is also a prediction of the rapid demise of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Today, China already has 160 million people, who, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are diligently and selflessly carrying out the construction of new democratic politics, economy, and cultural education. Contrary to the KMT-controlled areas, in the Liberated Areas, young students and comrades in cultural and educational circles not only have food to eat, clothes to wear, and houses to live in, but also have books to read and books to teach. Thousands upon thousands of students from the KMT-controlled areas have been and are pouring into the Liberated Areas. The democratic government guarantees them sufficient food and clothing with public funds and grain. At the same time, due to the vigorous development of various constructions in the Liberated Areas, it is also guaranteed that everyone has a job and a career after finishing their studies in school. We warmly welcome a large number of young students and colleagues in cultural, educational, and scientific circles to come to the Liberated Areas to participate in teaching, learning, and various construction works. The doors of North China University are open to you. We first extend our cordial fraternal hand to you.

Xinhua News Agency, North China, July 22nd: According to Tianjin newspapers, four hundred and four professors from universities in Beiping, including Tsinghua, Peking University, and Yenching University, jointly issued a declaration protesting the Jiang-Fu bandit gang's crime of manufacturing the "July 5th blood case" and massacring students from Northeast China. The declaration began by stating: "We, the professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and teachers of various universities in Beiping, unanimously lodge the most solemn and serious protest to the government for the 'July 5th blood case.'" The declaration pointed out: "The (Chiang) government announced the establishment of Temporary Universities and Temporary Middle Schools without any prior preparation. School buildings, funding, teachers, and equipment were all castles in the air. Afterwards, they repeatedly shirked and perfunctorily dealt with the matter, failing to provide reasonable treatment and comfort, causing thousands of young people to wander the streets, enduring hunger all day long, with a painful situation beyond description, arousing public outrage; and the Beiping Municipal Council further stimulated the situation on the 4th by passing a proposal forcing students to join the army, causing the youth who had suffered greatly to petition the speaker." The declaration put forward six demands to the Jiang government: "1. Thoroughly investigate responsibility. 2. Immediately hand over all the bodies of the dead for burial, treat and compensate the injured, and bear the living expenses of the disabled for life. 3. Immediately release the arrested Northeast students and lift the siege and blockade of their residences. 4. Revoke the Beiping Municipal Council's proposal on Northeast students. 5. Expedite relief to Northeast students. 6. Ensure that the same bloody case will not happen again in the future." Those who signed the declaration included Zuo Zonglun, Zhu Ziqing, Li Guangtian, Huang Guozhang, Ma Jian, Lu Bao'che, Li Changzhi, Yuan Hanqing, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Boju, Liang Sicheng, Deng Yizhe, Fu Hansi (foreigner), Xu Deheng, Fei Qing, Fu Jun, Wu Han, and others, totaling four hundred and four people.
