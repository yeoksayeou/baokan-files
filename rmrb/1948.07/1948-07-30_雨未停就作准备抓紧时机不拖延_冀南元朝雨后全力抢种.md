　　【Jinnan Electric Dispatch】 Jinnan District received welcome rain on July 11th and 12th, covering approximately two-fifths of the entire district. From the 19th to the 21st, there were another three consecutive days of overcast and rainy weather. Except for the situation in the Third Sub-district, which is unclear, the entire area has been thoroughly soaked. Various locations are seizing the opportunity to rush-plant and replant late seedlings to make up for the losses caused by the drought. Cadres in Yuanchao First District went to villages to call for rush-planting even before the rain stopped. Party members and village cadres in Tumentou and two other villages took the lead in a day and a half of intensive work, rush-planting 498 mu of sweet potatoes, corn, late millet, and replanting mung beans. All the unplanted land in the villages has been sown. Party members in Zhao Jiahe Village called on men and women to work together in the rain to plant sweet potatoes, planting 217 mu of sweet potatoes and corn in a day and a half, completing the planting of all unplanted land and now moving on to weeding and thinning. The Dishang sub-district of the Sixth District, having plowed the wheat stubble fields before the rain, immediately began sowing after the rain. In Huazhuang in the Seventh District, those with livestock and those without voluntarily helped each other to rush-plant and replant. Yang Liu, a widow, watched melons for others, guarding the melon vines and looking after chicks, in exchange for others rush-planting five and a half mu of late seedlings for her. Huang Chaoliang, who had no livestock, cooperated with Huang Chaoying, who did, using grass cutting and weeding to pay for the use of the ox. The whole village finished planting the wheat stubble fields in two days, totaling 1,181 mu of sweet potatoes, corn, and radishes. During the rush-planting, most villages found a shortage of farm implements, especially rollers. In the Sixth District and Baifenggu Village in the Fifth District, small carts were used as substitutes. After the rain, a total of 239,891 mu of late seedlings were rush-planted. Wu'yi County rush-planted late seedlings after the rain and also planted alfalfa to increase the fodder for cattle. After the widespread soaking rains on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, the First, Second, and Fourth District Committees immediately instructed the counties by telephone to seize the opportunity to rush-plant.

  　冀南元朝雨后全力抢种
    【冀南电】冀南区于七月十一、十二两日获喜雨，面积约占全区五分之二。十九日至二十一日，又连续阴雨三天，除三分区情况不明外，全境均已落透。各地正抓紧时机，抢种补种晚苗，补救旱灾的损失。元朝一区干部在阴雨未停时，即分头到村号召抢种。土门头等三村党员村干带头突击一天半，抢栽红薯、玉米、晚谷、补种绿豆共四百九十八亩，全村所有白茬地已全部播种。赵夹河村党员在雨中号召男女一齐动手栽种红薯，一天半栽种红薯、玉米二百一十七亩，白茬地全部种完，现已转入锄草间苗。六区堤上小区因雨前抓紧了犁麦茬地，雨后随即下种。七区化庄有牲口的和无牲口的自愿互助，抓紧抢种补种。孤寡杨刘氏给别人看瓜、押瓜秧、看小鸡、换取别人给抢种上五亩半晚苗。黄朝良没牲口，和有牲口的黄朝营互助，以割草和锄地还牛工。全村两天种完麦茬地，共计红薯、玉米、萝卜一千一百八十一亩。抢种中多数村庄发现农具缺乏，特别是砘子少。六区及五区白封固等村用小车轧来代替。雨后共抢种晚苗二十三万九千八百九十一亩。武邑县于雨后抢种晚苗，并栽种苜蓿，以增加耕牛饲料。十九日、二十日、二十一日三天普落透雨后，一、二、四等地委即以电话指示各县抓紧突击抢种。
