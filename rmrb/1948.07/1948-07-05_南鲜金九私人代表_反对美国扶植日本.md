　　South Korean Kim Gu's Personal Representative
    Opposes US Support for Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, North China, 2nd] According to the Tianjin Dagong Bao on June 11th: Li Zhongmo, the personal representative of Kim Gu, leader of the conservative Korean Independence Party, recently wrote an article responding to the Chinese people's movement against US support for Japan, stating: We have heard and witnessed the four hundred million Chinese brothers rising up and opposing the call for supporting Japan. They are telling the US government not to implement imperialist plans and support Japanese warlords; telling the Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek) government to have independent and autonomous diplomacy, and not to sacrifice the nation's destiny for thousands of years for temporary small gains. We Koreans support this great call with blood and tears. Now, half of Korea is still under the command of the American commander, with the former Japanese running dogs controlling the country under the advice of the Japanese. Those Japanese running dogs not only curse anti-Japanese revolutionaries and kill their own compatriots, but also wear American clothes and go abroad to continue the work that the Japanese did before September 18th. We cannot forget that the Japanese bandits slaughtered millions of Asians under the slogan of anti-communism for eight years. If Japan rises again, the Korean race will be exterminated, so we resolutely oppose supporting Japan.

　　南鲜金九私人代表
    反对美国扶植日本
    【新华社华北二日电】据六月十一日天津大公报载：南鲜保守的独立党领袖金九之私人代表李忠模，近撰文响应中国人民反对美国扶日的运动略称：吾人耳闻目睹中国四亿兄弟奋然起来反对扶植日本的呼声与光景。他们正告美国政府不要再实行帝国主义的计划，扶植日本军阀；正告中国（蒋介石）政府，外交要独立自主，不要图一时小利，断送千百年国家的命脉。我们韩国人以血泪应援这个伟大的呼声。现在韩国半部疆土，仍在倭奴的参谋下，由美国做司令员指挥着过去的日本走狗统制者。那些日本走狗不但咒骂排日革命者，残杀本国同胞，甚至还穿上美装出没海外，继续着九一八前倭奴所做的工作。我们不能忘记倭寇在防共口号下八年间屠杀了千百万亚洲人民。如果日本再起来，朝鲜就要灭种，所以我们决死反对扶植日本。
