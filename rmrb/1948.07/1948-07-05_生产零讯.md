  　　　　　Jizhong Establishes Water Conservancy Promotion Society
    In order to develop water conservancy and strengthen well digging and repair work, the Jizhong Administrative Office has decided to establish three water conservancy promotion societies. The first society is in Hejian, the second is in Anguo, and the third is in Xinji. The tasks of the water conservancy promotion societies are: to systematically and uniformly purchase well-digging tools and materials, transport them to county promotion societies, and supply them to the masses for well digging; to lead, educate, and coordinate well-digging teams in various places, improve the skills and political awareness of well-digging workers, and do a good job in well-digging; and to focus on mobilizing and organizing the masses to dig wells in areas where there is no well-digging tradition.
    　　　　Xiyang Fifth District Masses Seize the Time to Dig for Medicinal Herbs and Chop Wood on the Mountains
    The Xiyang Fifth District United Cooperative seizes the slack farming season to organize the masses to dig for medicinal materials, chop wood on the mountains, and raise silkworms, obtaining huge profits and alleviating famine. The district suffered a poor harvest last year, and many households had nothing to eat this spring. The masses generally plan to engage in sideline production after sowing is completed to supplement their grain. According to this requirement and the local conditions, the District United Cooperative first sent people to Songjiazhuang, Xingtai, to negotiate medicinal material sales, and then organized the masses to dig for medicinal materials. From the 12th of the fourth lunar month to the end of the month, the District United Cooperative collected a total of 25,500 jin of Bupleurum, Polygala, etc., and the masses earned 3.83 million yuan (Jicha, the same below), not including sporadic sales by various villages. At the time, each dou of corn cost 3,400 yuan, which could buy 112 shi and 7 dou. Tea Village is the poorest village in the Fifth District, suffering the most severe famine, but it has successfully overcome the spring famine due to vigorous sideline production. Ninety-nine people in the village dug for medicinal materials, twenty-one people chopped mountain goods, and twenty people wove mountain goods, earning a total of 880,000 yuan. Women raised silkworms, producing forty-four mats, each of which can produce eight jin of cocoons. (Hao Bin Yuan, Qiao Fu Xi)
    　　　　Changwan and Fangshan Launch Crash Summer Weeding Campaign
    Changwan, Fangshan, and other counties are rushing to weed the large fields for the second time. In Fujiatai, Changwan, women, the elderly, and the weak actively participated in summer weeding during the branch-support period. Li Shuren, a woman, participated in the work assignment group and weeded her nine mu of land for the first time through work assignments. Rongjun Lu Zhi and Zhou Gui were allocated six mu of land and have already begun weeding for the third time. The first weeding has been mostly completed in fifty-nine villages in Changwan, and the second weeding has also begun. In the Longmentai sub-district of the First District of Fangshan, seven villages have a total of 7,362.1 mu of land. Local young and middle-aged people seize the time to finish the first weeding and organize themselves to dig for medicinal materials and engage in transportation and sales. When Feng Village was weeding for the first time, they were delivering grain, so they divided the work within the work assignment group, sending one or two people to drive several animals to deliver grain, while the others stayed to weed the fields. At the same time, fifteen women were recruited to participate, and as a result, the grain was delivered on time without delaying weeding.

    　　　　昔阳五区群众抓紧刨药砍山
    昔阳五区联合社抓紧农事空隙，组织群众刨药材、砍山、养蚕，获得巨利，减轻灾荒。该区去年歉收，今春没吃户很多，群众一般都准备在下种完毕后搞副业生产，补充粮食。区联社根据群众这种要求与本地条件，先派人到邢台宋家庄某药栈接洽好药材销路，回去即组织群众刨药材。从阴历四月十二日到月底，区联社共收柴胡、远志等二万五千五百斤，群众赚洋三百八十三万元（冀钞，下同），各村零星出售的尚未计入。按当时每斗玉茭三千四百元，能买一百一十二石七斗。茶叶村是五区灾荒最严重的一个穷村，但因副业搞得起劲，也胜利渡过春荒。该村刨药材的九十九人，砍山货的二十一人，编作山货的二十人，总共赚洋八十八万元。妇女养蚕四十四席，每席可产八斤茧。（郝滨远、乔富喜）
    　　　　昌宛房山突击夏锄
    昌宛、房山等县赶锄二遍大田。昌宛傅家台在支前期，妇女老弱积极参加夏锄。妇女李淑仁参加了拨工组，九亩地靠拨工锄了头遍。荣军路之、周贵三分得了六亩地，现已开始锄三遍。昌宛五十九个村头遍大部锄完，二遍亦已开始。房山一区龙门台小区七个村，共有土地七千三百六十二亩一分，当地青壮年抓紧锄完头遍的空隙，组织起来刨药材搞运销。封村在锄头遍时正碰上运粮，他们即在拨工组内进行了分工，抽出一二人赶去几头牲口送粮，其他留下锄地。同时吸收十五个妇女参加，结果粮既按时送了，又没误了锄苗。
