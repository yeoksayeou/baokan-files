　　Snippets on Construction in Newly Liberated Cities
    △Since the liberation of Yichuan City, Northern Shaanxi on March 3rd, until the end of May, the number of shops in the city has surged from over 200 during the rule of the bandit Zong Nan to 452. Including 152 handicraft workshops, this is approximately three times the number before liberation. Additionally, there are 461 street vendors. The Xinghua Soap Factory now produces over 10,000 bars of soap per month. Guo Junkai, a general merchandise merchant, has earned three times the profit in the past three months compared to his entire annual profit before liberation.
    △Before liberation, Hancheng, Northern Shaanxi, had only about 200 shops. From its liberation on March 24th to mid-June, the number increased to 388, with an additional 127 small vendors. Many merchants from various regions come here to purchase goods. The Hanguang Paper Mill in Xuecun, Beiguan, Hancheng, which closed down at the end of last year due to the Kuomintang's excessive taxes and levies, resumed operations after the trade company provided a loan of 14 million agricultural currency units. In June, the two vats produced 1,200 reams of paper, only 100 reams less than the factory's original output.
    △Huiguo Town (80 li east of Luoyang), a famous cigarette production area in Western Henan, originally had over 40 cigarette factories with 100 cigarette machines. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, due to the dumping of American cigarettes and the endless imposition of exorbitant taxes, only 14 cigarette factories barely survived by the time of liberation on April 6th, and there were only about 30 shops in the entire town. After the democratic government abolished the exorbitant taxes and levies of the Kuomintang bandit regime and supported the development of industry and commerce, the number of cigarette factories had increased to 35 by the beginning of May; the number of shops had increased to 239, and there were also over 80 street vendors.
    △The democratic government of the third and fourth districts of Luoyang City recently issued loans of 476,200 Zhongzhou currency units (each unit currently equivalent to 7,000 Kuomintang currency units) to small handicraft and transportation industries. A total of 470 vendors, etc., received loans and are now engaged in small handicraft production such as textile and ironwork.
    △The Luoyang City Bureau of Culture and Education held a forum for primary and secondary school teachers and staff on the 16th of last month, attended by 135 teachers and staff. Political Commissar Li Wenfu, Mayor Yang Shaoqiao, and Bureau Chief of Culture and Education Liang Weizhi attended the meeting and reported on the New Democratic education policy and its implementation guidelines in Luoyang City. The teachers and staff attending the meeting engaged in a heated discussion on the above issues for five hours. Finally, it was decided to establish the Luoyang City Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Union, and Cui Xianping and Zhang Zhe were elected as the chairman and vice-chairman of the union.
    △Students from primary and secondary schools in Luoyang City held a preparatory meeting for the Luoyang City Student Union on the 27th of last month, attended by over 40 student representatives from more than ten primary and secondary school units. Zhang Shangde, Liu Tongren, Guo Lijun, and four others were elected as preparatory committee members, responsible for drafting the organizational charter and work program of the Luoyang City Student Union.

　　新解放城市建设零讯
    △陕北宜川城自三月三日解放到五月底止，城内商店已由胡匪宗南统治时之二百余家激增到四百五十二家，连同一百五十二家手工业作坊约等于解放前的三倍，另外尚有摊贩四百六十一处。兴华肥皂厂现月产肥皂万余条。杂货商郭俊开三个多月来所获利润等于解放前全年利润的三倍。
    △陕北韩城解放前仅有商店二百家左右，从三月二十四日解放到六月中旬，即增至三百八十八家。另有小摊贩一百二十七家。各地客商来此办货者不少。由于蒋匪苛杂勒索于去年底倒闭的韩城北关薛村韩光纸厂，经贸易公司贷予农币一千四百万元复业后，六月份中两个池子即产纸一千二百刀，较该厂原有产量仅少一百刀。
    △豫西著名卷烟产地回郭镇（在洛阳东八十里）原有卷烟厂四十余家，卷烟机一百架。在蒋匪统治时期，由于美烟倾销及苛捐杂税层出不穷，至四月六日解放时仅剩卷烟厂十四家勉强支持，全镇商铺亦仅三十余家。经民主政府废除蒋匪统治时期之苛捐杂税，并扶助工商业发展，截至五月初旬止，卷烟厂已增至三十五家；商店增至二百三十九家，摊贩也有八十余家。
    △洛阳市三、四两区民主政府顷发放小手工业与运输业贷款中州币四十七万六千二百元（每元现在合蒋币七千元）。获得贷款之摊贩等共四百七十人，现已纷纷从事纺织、铁工等小手工业生产。
    △洛阳市文教局于上月十六日召开全市中小学教职员座谈会，到会教职员一百三十五人。会上李政委文甫、杨市长少桥及文教局长梁维直均出席报告新民主主义教育政策及其在洛市实施之方针步骤等问题。到会教职员对上述各问题展开热烈讨论历五小时。最后决定成立洛市中小学教职员联合会，并选出崔仙萍、张哲为联合会正副主席。
    △洛阳市各中小学学生上月二十七日召开洛阳市学生联合会筹备会，到中小学十余单位学生代表四十余人。选出张尚德、刘同仁、郭丽君等七人为筹备委员，负责起草洛市学联会的组织章程与工作纲领。【新华社陕北十九日电】
