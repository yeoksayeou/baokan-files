Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. TASS, Moscow, 24th: The Warsaw Conference, attended by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary, issued a declaration on the 24th, strongly condemning the decisions of the London Conference on the German issue, presided over by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, with the participation of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The declaration exposed that the decisions aimed at dividing Germany, obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, resisting the demilitarization and democratization of Germany, restoring Germany's war potential, and subordinating West Germany's economy to US and British capital. The declaration, following the spirit of the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements, proposed specific suggestions for rapidly resolving the German issue through a four-power agreement. The full text of the declaration, excluding the preamble, is as follows:

　　　　(1)
The decisions of the London Conference are a direct step towards the completion of the division and disintegration of Germany. After the US, British, and French governments abandoned their previously announced promises of political and economic unity for Germany, the London Conference prepared to establish a West German government, separated from the rest of Germany, through the aforementioned separatist actions of these countries. To achieve this goal, it was stipulated to convene a specially selected constitutional assembly, including representatives from the states of the British, American, and French occupation zones. This constitutional assembly must form a puppet government for West Germany, composed of elements among the Germans who are agreeable to the occupation authorities of the Western occupation zones, closely connected with US and British monopoly capital, but detached from the German people and hostile to their peaceful aspirations. This means that the US, Britain, and France concluded a secret agreement aimed at dividing and dismembering Germany politically and economically, and establishing such a separatist government in the Western occupation zones. This government is bound to oppose the legitimate demands of the German people for the unification and democratization of Germany. In addition to the aforementioned measures to achieve political division and dismemberment of Germany, the US, British, and French governments are now implementing new measures to divide and dismember Germany economically. The US, British, and French governments, immediately following the London Conference, began to implement the separate currency reform in the Western occupation zones of Germany, announced on June 18th, even though the aforementioned communiqué made no mention of the decisions on this issue at the London Conference. The Soviet Union had proposed implementing a unified currency reform for all of Germany based on a four-power agreement among the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. However, contrary to this obvious need, the US, British, and French governments implemented a separate currency reform in the Western occupation zones of Germany. Instead of implementing a unified currency system with a single mark for all of Germany, in accordance with the agreement previously established by the four-power governments and existing until now, the separate currency reform was implemented, and special marks were issued in West Germany. This created an economic barrier between West Germany and the rest of Germany, and created numerous new difficulties in eliminating economic disorder and restoring the German economy. The currency reform currently being implemented in the Western occupation zones of Germany aims to ensure profits for the big financial groups, primarily those German monopolists who maintain close ties with US and British monopoly capital. This promotes the increase of unemployment in West Germany, the deterioration of the material conditions of the working people, and will create new difficulties in economic relations with other countries. This is the inevitable consequence of the London Conference; the decisions of the London Conference will inevitably lead to the political and economic division and dismemberment of Germany.

　　　　(2)
The policy of dividing and dismembering Germany obstructs the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Without a peace treaty with Germany, it is impossible to end the prolonged state of war (note: before the signing of a peace treaty, the original belligerent countries are still legally in a state of war) and the occupation regime in Europe. The London Conference communiqué made no mention of a peace treaty with Germany, nor did it mention the preparation for a peace treaty, which is not accidental. The decisions of the London Conference of the US, Britain, and France, with the participation of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, confirmed that the governments of these countries, as well as the German groups closely connected with them, are not interested in the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the early withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany. Instead of seeking a peaceful resolution of the entire German issue, the US, British, and French governments are preparing to promulgate so-called "occupation statutes" in the Western occupation zones of Germany, as deliberately hinted at in the London Conference communiqué. On the one hand, the interests of all peace loving nations require the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, which must abolish the occupation regime in German and fully restore the conditions for the peaceful and democratic development of the German people. On the other hand, the US, British, and French governments are unwilling to agree to the early conclusion of a peace treaty and are trying to impose their "occupation statutes" on the Western occupation zones of Germany in order to arbitrarily prolong the occupation of Germany for many years to come, placing the heavy burden of occupation expenses on the German people. This policy of the US, British, and French authorities, which leads to the enslavement of the German people and the delay in the peaceful resolution of the European issue, is incompatible with the task of transforming Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country, and also incompatible with the efforts of the people of all countries to establish a democratic peace in Europe as soon as possible.

　　　　(3)
The decisions on the state institutions of the Western German occupation zones are filled with an anti-democratic spirit. All preparations for convening the so-called constitutional assembly and formulating the German constitution have fallen into the hands of the three military governors and the state premiers of the Western German occupation zones. Democratic parties, trade unions, and other democratic organizations representing the interests of the German people are completely excluded from this work. The interests of peace and security for the people of European countries require the abolition of the Hitler-style German centralism that destroyed the state parliaments and autonomous state governments. It requires the restoration of the non-centralized system before Hitler's rule, and requires the re-establishment of state parliaments and a bicameral parliament for all of Germany. As long as democratic organizations have the possibility of free activity, it can guarantee German unity and the transformation of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. The decisions of the London Conference, however, have taken a completely different direction. Under the pretext of preventing the restoration of a centralized German empire, the London Conference, disregarding the development process of modern democratic countries, attempts to push Germany backwards, imposing a federal state on the German people. In this federal state, the main powers are given to the divided states, while the central government has only secondary functions. This plan of the US, Britain, and France aims to dismember Germany, thereby destroying an independent Germany. The implementation of this German federalization (dismemberment) plan makes the concept of German unity a tool for those who seek to restore Germany as a militaristic country that dominates the people of other countries. As a result, revanchism will rise, narrow patriotism will grow, and the environment for the emergence of a new Bismarck or even a new Hitler will be created. If the German people's desire for German unity once again becomes a tool in the hands of German narrow patriots and militarists (who have already received much encouragement from the occupation authorities of West Germany), this will inevitably lead to the recurrence of German aggression, causing extremely serious consequences for the people of European countries (including the German people); this will force peace-loving countries to intensify their struggle against the instigators of a new war.

　　　　(4)
The policies pursued by the occupying powers in West Germany are encouraging German revisionists. These elements are conducting a movement against the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements on the demilitarization and denazification of Germany, the obligation of Germany to pay reparations for the losses caused by its aggression, and the well-known decision on the transfer of German residents, attempting to use these residents to achieve hostile aims against neighboring countries. The movement of German revisionist elements is particularly aimed at opposing the Polish-German border along the Oder and Neisse rivers, which is an unchangeable border—a border of peace. The London Conference avoided the issue of the revisionist movement, thereby encouraging the aggressive tendencies of the German reactionary groups. In such a situation, measures against all revisionist activities form one of the most important conditions for consolidating the peace and security of the people of European countries.

　　　　(5)
The decisions of the London Conference of the US, Britain, and France subordinate the economy of West Germany to the intentions of the US and Britain, making it dependent on the implementation of the so-called "European Marshall Plan." This means that the industry and other economic sectors of West Germany will be shackled by the monopolistic plans of American and British capitalism. They are striving to control the entire economic life of the West German occupation zones, without any concern for the genuine revival and development of German peaceful industry, and consider it to be their competitor. The purpose of this expansionist policy is to make the countries associated with the "Marshall Plan" even more dependent on American and British monopoly capital. The revival and development of German peaceful industry not only does not conflict with the interests of the people of other countries, but is also consistent with the work of European economic recovery. The German people should be given broad opportunities to restore and develop peaceful industry, agriculture, transportation, and foreign trade; otherwise, Germany cannot survive and cannot fulfill its obligation to pay reparations to the countries that suffered from German aggression. At the same time, four-power control should be preserved for some time to prevent the restoration of German military industry and German militarism. Including the economy of the West German occupation zones in the "Marshall Plan" means including this part of Germany in the division of the entire Europe into two camps being carried out under the "Marshall Plan": on the one hand, the camp of European countries that have adopted the "Marshall Plan" and therefore submit to American control; on the other hand, the camp of European countries that disagree with foreign interference in their internal affairs, including the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. Thus, the London Conference not only completed the plan to divide and dismember Germany, but also further deepened the division of European countries into two opposing camps in accordance with the "Marshall Plan." Obviously, this policy has nothing in common with the true interests of the people of European countries, nor with the economic recovery of Europe. The implementation of this policy by the US, Britain, and France will place the economy of the West German occupation zones in the difficult subordinate situation of the expansionist plans of foreign capital, which disregards the interests of democratic Germany.

　　　　(6)
The London Conference passed special decisions on the Ruhr. The conference decided to establish a special agency to control the distribution of Ruhr coal, coke, and steel, composed of representatives from the countries participating in the London Conference. However, the control of this agency over the production of coal, coke, and steel has been lifted, which guarantees that American and British financial and industrial monopolists can maintain their dominance over Ruhr industry. Therefore, instead of transferring the Ruhr coal mines and metal trusts and cartels to the German people (which is what the Soviet Union and other participating countries in this conference firmly advocate), the US and British governments are actually taking over the entire heavy industry of the Ruhr into their own hands, not allowing France and the Soviet Union to participate in the control of production, nor allowing any German democratic organizations to intervene. This facilitates secret agreements between American and British monopolists (on the one hand) and the German Ruhr coal and steel tycoons (on the other hand), thereby creating the possibility of rebuilding Germany's war potential and establishing a foothold for new German aggression. It is not difficult to see that this policy is incompatible with the interests of peace and the interests of the German people and the people of European countries. Only by transferring the Ruhr heavy industry to the German people and determining that the production and distribution of Ruhr industrial products should be controlled by the four powers (Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France) for a certain period of time (the four powers together can guarantee that the Ruhr industry will only develop for peaceful purposes), can the possibility of solving the Ruhr issue from the perspective of the peace and security of the people of Europe be created.

　　　　(7)
All of the above proves that the London decisions greatly violate the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements on German unity, demilitarization, denazification, and democratization, on destroying Germany's war potential and eradicating conditions that may promote new German aggression. In view of this, the London communiqué's claim that the London decisions will inevitably make it easier for the four powers to reach an agreement on the German issue in the future should be considered completely untenable. The untenability of this assertion is even obvious from the fact that the decisions of the London Conference completely contradict the decisions previously adopted at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences, and undermine the two agreements on the four-power control mechanism for Germany and the consideration of the German issue by the four-power foreign ministers' conference. The London separatist conference of the US, Britain, and France, with the participation of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and the London separatist decisions of these countries, cannot make it easier for the four powers to reach an agreement on the German issue, but can only undermine the trust of the people of all countries in international agreements involving the United States and Britain. It is not difficult to see that violations of international agreements cannot inspire people's trust in the countries that violate these agreements. In view of this, we refuse to recognize the legal effect or any moral authority of any decision of the London Conference.

　　　　(8)
In accordance with the Yalta Conference and Potsdam Conference agreements on the German issue, the governments of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary believe that the following issues should be resolved first without any delay:

One: Implement measures to ensure the final demilitarization of Germany through an agreement between the four countries, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States.

Two: In order to develop the peaceful sectors of the Ruhr industry and prevent the reconstruction of Germany's war potential, determine that the four powers (Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States) will control the heavy industry of the Ruhr for a certain period of time.

Three: Through an agreement between the four governments of Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States, establish a democratic and peace-loving provisional government for all of Germany, composed of representatives from German democratic parties and groups, with the aim of creating a guarantee to prevent the resurgence of German aggression.

Four: In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, conclude a peace treaty with Germany so that the occupying forces of all countries can withdraw from Germany within one year after the conclusion of the treaty.

Five: Formulate measures for Germany to fulfill its obligation to pay reparations to the countries that suffered from German aggression.

　　华沙会议发表宣言
    揭发伦敦会议决定旨在分裂德国提出由四强协议来解决德国问题
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯拉夫、南斯拉夫、波兰、罗马尼亚及匈牙利八国外长举行的华沙会议，二十四日发表宣言，严斥由美、英、法政府主持的，有比、荷、卢政府参加的对德问题伦敦会议的决定，揭发该决定旨在分裂德国，阻挠对德和约的缔结。抗拒德国非军国主义化与民主化，恢复德国的战争潜力，并使西德的经济从属于美英资本。该宣言并遵循雅尔塔与波茨顿协定的精神，提出由四强协议的途径来迅速解决德国问题的具体建议。除序言外，该宣言主文原文如下：
    　　　　（一）
    伦敦会议的决定，是直接走向分裂和瓦解德国的完成。美、英、法政府放弃了原先宣布过的对德国政治和经济统一的诺言之后，伦敦会议就准备以上述各国的分裂行动，建立一个自德国其他部分分裂出来的西德政府。为达此目的，就规定召开一特别挑选出来的，包括英、美、法占领区各州代表的立宪议会，而立宪议会必须组成一个西部德国的伪政府，由德国人中那些为西占区占领当局合意的，和美、英独占资本有密切联系、但脱离德国人民、并仇视其和平愿望的分子组成。这就是说，美、英、法缔结密约，目的在于分裂与肢解德国的政治和经济，并在西部占领区成立一个这样分裂的政府，这个政府必定反对德国人民对德国之统一和民主化的合法要求。除了上述实现政治上分裂和肢解德国的措施以外，美、英、法政府现在正在实行在经济上分裂和肢解德国的新措施。美、英、法政府在紧接着伦敦会议之后，就开始实行于六月十八日宣布的德国西部占领区单独的货币改革，尽管上述公报对伦敦会议上关于这个问题的决定只字未提。苏联曾建议在苏、美、英、法四国协议之基础上实行全德统一的货币改革。但是，和这个显然的需要相反，美、英、法政府在德国西占区实行了单独的货币改革。美、英、法政府不但不施行经四国政府从前确立的并一直存在到现在的协议，在全德发行统一马克的单一货币制度，反而单独实行货币改革，并在德国西部发行特种马克。这样就在德国西部和德国其他部分之间竖立了一道经济上的屏障，并且在消除经济紊乱和恢复德国经济方面制造了无数新的困难。德国西占区现在实行的货币改革，其目的在于保证大财阀，首先是那些与美英独占资本维持密切联系的德国独占资本家获利，这就促使西德失业的增长，劳动人民物质条件的恶化，并将造成和其他各国经济关系中的新的困难。这就是伦敦会议的不可避免的后果；伦敦会议的决定，必将导向德国政治和经济的分裂及肢解。
    　　　　（二）
    分裂和肢解德国的政策，阻挠了对德和约的缔结，而没有对德和约，就不可能结束拖延的战争状态（按：和约未签订前，原交战国双方在法律上仍处于战争状态中）和欧洲的占领政权。伦敦会议的公报没有只字提及对德和约，同样也没有提到和约准备的问题，这不是偶然的。有比、荷、卢参加的美、英、法伦敦会议的决定，证实了这些国家的政府以及和他们密切联系的德国集团，对及早缔结对德和约、及早自德国撤退占领军并不感兴趣。美、英、法政府不但不求整个德国问题的和平解决，反而准备在德国西占区颁布所谓“占领法规”，伦敦会议公报就故意含糊其辞的暗示了这一点。一方面，一切爱好和平民族的利益要求及早缔结对德和约，而缔结对德和约就必须取消在德国的占领政权，并充分恢复德国人民和平与民主发展的条件；另一方面，美、英、法政府却不愿答应早日缔结对德和约，并竭力将他们的“占领法规”强加于德国西占区，以便在今后很多年内专横地延长对德国的占领，把占领费的重荷压在德国人民头上。美、英、法当局这一导向奴役德国人民，并延岩欧洲问题和平解决的政策，是与使德国转变为爱好和平与民主国家的任务不符，也与各国人民要求尽速建立欧洲民主和平的努力不符的。
    　　　　（三）
    关于西德占领区国家机构的决定，充满了反民主的精神。召开所谓立宪议会和制订德国宪法的一切准备工作，都已落入西德占区三军事总督和各州总理的手中。民主党派与职工会以及代表德国人民利益的其他民主团体，完全被拒于这一工作之外。欧洲各国人民和平与安全的利益，要求取消摧毁州议会及州自治政府的希特勒式的德国中央集权制度，要求恢复希特勒执政前的非中央集权制度，并要求重设州议会及整个德国的两院制议会。只要民主团体获有自由活动的可能，就能保证德国统一及德国在和平与民主的基础上实行转变。伦敦会议的决定，却采取了截然不同的方向。伦敦会议以防止中央集权的德意志帝国的恢复为借口，不惜违反现代民主国家的发展过程，企图把德国倒推回去，以联邦国家强加于德国人民身上，在这联邦国家中，把主要的权力赋予分裂的各州，中央政府则仅有次要的职权。美、英、法这一计划，目的在于肢解德国，从而摧毁独立的德国。这一德国联邦化（肢解化）计划的执行，便使德国统一的观念，成为那些力求把德国恢复为统治其他各国人民的军国主义国家之人们的工具。其结果，报复主义将会抬头，狭隘爱国主义将会增长，新俾斯麦甚或新希特勒出现的环境将会产生。假如德国人民要求德国统一的愿望，再度成了德国狭隘爱国主义者及军国主义者（他们业已得到西德占领当局的许多鼓励）手中的工具，这便必然将导向德国侵略的重演，对欧洲各国人民（包括德国人民）造成极严重的后果；这将迫使爱好和平的各国人民不得不对新战争的煽动者加紧进行斗争。
    　　　　（四）
    西德各占领国所奉行的政策，正鼓励着德国修正主义分子。这些分子正进行着运动，反对雅尔塔会议与波茨顿会议关于德国民主化及非军国主义化、德国对其侵略所造成的损失应负的赔偿义务等各项问题的协定，反对人所共知的关于迁移德国居民的决定，并试图利用这些居民达到敌视邻国的目的。德国修正主义分子的运动，尤其在于反对沿奥得河与西尼斯河的波德疆界，而这是不可更动的疆界——和平的疆界。伦敦会议避开了修正主义运动的问题，因而鼓励了德国反动集团的侵略倾向。在这样的情况之下，反对一切修正主义活动的措施，便形成了巩固欧洲各国人民和平与安全最重要的条件之一。
    　　　　（五）
    美英法三国伦敦会议的决定，使西德的经济从属于美英的意图，使之依赖所谓“欧洲马歇尔计划”的执行。这意味着西德的工业及其他经济部门，将受美国以及英国资本主义独占计划的桎梏。它们正力求控制西德占区的整个经济生活，而决不关心德国和平工业真正的复兴与发展，并认为那是他们的竞争者。这一扩张政策的目的，在于使同“马歇尔计划”有联系的国家，更增加其对美英垄断资本的依赖性。德国和平工业的复兴与发展，不仅与其他各国人民的利益毫无抵触，并且与欧洲经济复兴的工作是相符合的。应该使德国人民获得广泛的机会，以恢复并发展和平工业、农业、运输及对外贸易；否则德国便不能生存，便不能对曾遭受德国侵略的国家尽其赔偿义务。同时，四强管制应该再予保存若干时期，以防止德国军事工业与德国军国主义的恢复。将西德占领区经济列入“马歇尔计划”。意味着将德国这一部分列入刻在“马歇尔计划”下进行的把整个欧洲切成两个阵营的划分中：一方面是那些采纳“马歇尔计划”、因而服从美国控制的欧洲国家的阵营；另一方面是那些不同意外国干涉本国内政的欧洲国家的阵营，苏联与各人民民主共和国也在其中。这样，伦敦会议不仅完成了分裂并肢解德国的计划，并且同时还根据“马歇尔计划”，进一步地加深着把欧洲国家切成两个对立阵营的划分。很明显地，这一政策与欧洲各国人民的真实利益，与欧洲经济复兴毫无相同之处。美英法这一政策的执行，将使西德占领区的经济处于外国资本的扩张计划之难堪的从属境况中，而外国资本是毫不考虑民主德国的利益的。
    　　　　（六）
    伦敦会议曾通过对鲁尔的特别决定。该会议已决定设立一个管制鲁尔煤、焦煤与钢之分配的专门机构，由参加伦敦会议各国的代表组成。而这一机构对煤、焦煤与钢的生产的管制权则已被撤销，这保证了美国及英国金融与工业垄断资本家得以保持其对鲁尔工业的统治。因此，不是将鲁尔煤矿与五金托辣斯及卡迭尔转归德国人民所占有（这是苏联以及本会议其他参与国所坚决主张的），而是美国及英国政府实际上把鲁尔的重工业全部掌握在自己手中，不让法国与苏联参加生产的管制，也不让任何德国民主团体过问，这就便利了美英垄断资本家（一方）与德国的鲁尔煤业及钢业大亨（另一方）之间的密约，从而创造了重建德国战争潜力及设立德国新侵略的立足点的可能性。不难看出：这种政策是与和平的利益、与德国人民和欧洲各国人民的利益绝不相容的。只有将鲁尔重工业转入德国人民之手，并确定在一定时间内由四强（苏、美、英、法）管制鲁尔工业出品的生产与分配（四强共同一起是能保证鲁尔工业只为和平目的而发展的），才会创造出从欧洲人民的和平与安全的利益来解决鲁尔问题的可能性。
    　　　　（七）
    上述一切均证明伦敦决定是大大违反关于德国统一、德国非军国主义化、非纳粹化及民主化，关于摧毁德国战争潜力及根绝可能促成德国新侵略之条件的雅尔塔与波茨顿诸协定。有鉴于此，伦敦公报所谓伦敦决定势必使四强今后在德国问题上易于达成协议云云，应认为是完全不足取的。这一断言之不足取，甚至从下述事实看来也是明显的，即伦敦会议的决定，完全与前此在雅尔塔及波茨顿会议上所通过的决定相抵触，而且破坏了关于四强对德管制机构以及由四强外长会议审议德国问题的这两项协定。有比、荷、卢参加的美、英、法三国伦敦分裂会议和这些国家的伦敦分裂决定，绝不能使四强易于达成对德问题的协议，只能破坏各国人民对美国及英国参加的国际协议的信任。不难看出：违反国际协议的行为，绝不能引起人们对那些违反这些协议的国家的信任。有鉴于此，我们拒绝承认伦敦会议任何决定在法律上的效力或任何道义上的权力。
    　　　　（八）
    遵照雅尔塔会议及波茨顿会议对德问题的协定，苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯拉夫、南斯拉夫、波兰、罗马尼亚及匈牙利政府认为，下列问题应首先予以解决而不容有任何稽延：
    一、以英、苏、法、美四国协议的办法，履行确保德国最后非军国主义化的措施。
    二、为发展鲁尔工业的和平部门及防止德国战争潜力之重建计，确定四强（英、苏、法、美）在一定时间管制鲁尔重工业。
    三、以英、苏、法、美四国政府协议的办法，建立全德民主及爱好和平的临时政府，由德国民主政党及团体代表组成之，其目的在于创立一种防止德国侵略之重起的保证。
    四、遵照波茨顿协议，缔结对德和约，俾使一切国家的占领军可以在和约缔结后一年内撤出德国。
    五、制订德国履行对遭受德国侵略各国之赔偿义务的措施。
