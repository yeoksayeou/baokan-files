　　[Jinan Telegram] Recent continuous rain and mountain torrents have caused flooding disasters in the river systems of Handan, Chengci, Linzhang, Wei County, and Daming in the Third District of Southern Hebei, and Ningnan, Longyao, and Ren County in the Fourth District. In Linzhang County of the Third District, the Zhang River breached at Santaicun in the Sixth District and Qianwangzhuang in the Fifth District, inundating crops in more than ten villages. Within Chengci, the @Niu River flows directly into the Fuyang River, forming a "T" shape. The Fuyang River water has overflowed from the riverbanks, affecting over ten villages. On the 21st, another heavy rain fell in Ci County, and the Fuyang River water flowed torrentially through Handan, Chengci, and Yongnian. According to the masses, the water was more fierce than in the sixth year of the Republic of China. In the first district of Yongnian, the Fuyang River breached at Qutun, but it has now been plugged. Many crops in the upstream areas of Chengci, Handan, and Quzhou (Qi Zhi) were flooded. On the evening of the 21st, mountain water poured into the Fuyang River from the @River. Due to the excessive water flow, it reached the urban area of Handan, causing nearly 3,000 houses to collapse. The municipal government is currently coordinating housing, distributing relief grain, and resettling disaster victims. In Wei County, the Zhang River breached in seven places, and small breaches in four places have been plugged. In Daming, the Zhang River breached in three places; the breach at Nan Shangcun alone inundated more than 20 villages. Huilong in Zhangnan County is surrounded by water, flooding more than 30 villages to the north. In Ningnan County of the Fourth District, the Sha River breached at places such as Zhao Zhuang, north of Suqiu and south of Zhao Zhuang, flooding nearly a hundred hectares of land. Ren County town has been surrounded by water, and the water has crossed the bridge three li north of the city. Details are unclear. In Nanhe County, the Sha River and @River have breached in several places. Longyao town is surrounded by a vast expanse of water, six or seven feet deep in deep areas and two or three feet deep in shallow areas, with twenty to thirty villages flooded. Cadres and the masses in the disaster-stricken counties are making every effort to plug the breaches and overcome the flood. County party secretaries and county heads personally went to the river embankment to lead the masses to plug the breaches. Each county has organized a flood prevention headquarters to rush to plug the breaches and patrol day and night. The downstream counties of the Fuyang River have all made flood prevention arrangements.
　　[Jizhong News] The Tenth Special Commissioner's Office and the Tenth Military Sub-district's Administrative and Political Departments jointly issued flood prevention instructions, pointing out that due to continuous rain in various places, river water may flood; in addition, the Wang Bandit Fenggang is attempting to breach dikes to flood and harm the people, making this year's flood prevention work particularly important. Militiamen and people's militia should take guns in one hand and shovels in the other, implement a combination of armed work, and carry out repairs. Important dike sections should be given armed protection during the most dangerous times of repair. The serious waste of manpower and material resources in past river works should be strictly corrected, old stockpiles should be quickly cleared, and a strict income and expenditure management system should be established. It is also necessary to strengthen water situation reporting and flood prevention reporting.

　　冀南三四分区洪水成灾
  　政府领导群众全力抢堵决口
    【冀南电】近日阴雨连绵，山洪暴发，冀南三分区邯郸、成磁、临漳、魏县、大名，四分区宁南、隆尧、任县等县所属河系均泛滥成灾。三分区临漳县境的漳河在六区三台村及五区前王庄决口，十余村的田禾被淹。成磁境内＠牛河直灌滏阳河，成“丁”字形，滏阳河水已从河岸漫出，有十数村被灾。二十一日磁县又落大雨，滏阳河水经邯郸、成磁、永年汹涌而下，据群众谈：水势比民国六年还猛。永年一区滏阳河曲屯开口，现已堵住。上游成磁、邯郸、曲周（企之）被淹田禾甚多。二十一日晚山水由＠河注滏阳河，因水势过大，流至邯郸市区，房子倒塌近三千间。市府正调剂房子，发放救济粮，安置灾民。魏县境内漳河决口七处，现已堵住小口四处。大名境内漳河决口三处，仅南上村一处决口即淹及二十多村。漳南县回隆周围皆水，向北淹了三十多村。四分区宁南境内沙河在素邱以北赵庄以南等处决口，淹地近百顷。任县城已被水围住，水势从城北三里桥越桥而过，详情不明。南河境内沙河、＠河决口数处，隆尧城周围已成一片汪洋，深处六七尺，浅处二三尺，被淹村庄二三十个。被灾各县干部群众正全力抢堵决口，克服水患。县委书记、县长亲临河堤，领导群众堵口，各县都已组织了防汛指挥部，抢堵决口，昼夜巡逻。滏阳河下流各县皆已作了防汛布置。
    【冀中讯】十专署及十分区司政两部联合发出防汛指示。指出：因各地阴雨连绵，河水可能汛滥；加以王匪风岗企图扒堤放水淹害人民，使今年防汛工作特别重要。民工和民兵应一手拿枪一手拿锨，实行武工结合，进行修护。重要堤段在最危险时，应武装掩护抢修。对过去河工人力物力严重浪费现象应严加纠正，旧存物资应很快清理，建立严格的收支保管制度。并且要加强水情报告与防汛报导。
