Shijiazhuang News: The civil engineering construction cooperative organized by wood and tile workers in the Fourth District and Third Street of Shijiazhuang is a production cooperative for collective mutual assistance of wood and tile workers. It is combined with the labor union organization. The director of the cooperative is also the director of the labor union, and the leader of the cooperative member group is also the leader of the labor union group. In the beginning, there was no capital. It was only organized by a group of wood and tile workers to contract projects. After more than five months, the number of members has grown to more than 150, gathering capital of 3.84 million yuan (border currency). The organization has enabled them to overcome the difficulties of small and scattered groups, insufficient funds, and incomplete manpower. They can contract for larger construction projects, ensure that all members have regular work, and drive more than 50 outside workers to produce. When there is a construction project, the cooperative will contract for it uniformly. First, the director technician will conduct an on-site survey, and then a meeting of group leaders will be held to decide whether to contract. If it is decided, the members will submit their own small subcontracting plans, which will be discussed at the meeting, and the most cost-effective one will be contracted. The contractor is responsible for freely organizing a group of members and recruiting a group of outside workers for construction (if there are not enough workers in the cooperative, outside workers can also be contacted). After the project is completed, a meeting is held to review the reasons for profit and loss. The cooperative stipulates that in addition to earning wages, the cooperative will distribute 35 percent of the profits as dividends for shares, 35 percent as labor dividends (based on the labor days of the members), and 30 percent as dividends for staff. The savings in labor and materials in the small subcontract are equally divided by the contracting members, and the saved working hours can be used to work elsewhere, and the wages earned are owned by the individual. All members fully exerted their enthusiasm. In April, the first phase of settlement yielded a net profit of 17 million yuan. In addition to contracting for larger projects, they are now beginning to operate in other areas. There are several points in the current system and methods of the cooperative that are worth studying and improving: (1) Wages and bonuses are all evenly distributed, which will certainly not be completely reasonable. If a certain reward system can be established, it will certainly be able to give better play to the enthusiasm of technicians and workers; (2) We should advocate bringing apprentices, especially leading some small workers to learn skills; (3) We should advocate small workers joining the cooperative and implement labor dividends for small workers, which can also improve the labor efficiency of small workers.

　　石市土木合作社业务日益发展
    【石家庄讯】石家庄四区三街木瓦工人组织的土木建筑合作社，系木瓦工人集体互助的生产合作社，它与工会组织结合，合作社主任即工会主任，社员小组长亦即工会小组长。开始时并无资金，仅由一伙木瓦工人组织起来包工；经过五个多月到现在，社员已发展至一百五十多人，集结资金三百八十四万元（边币，下同）。组织起来使他们克服了小伙分散、资金不足、人手不齐的困难，能够包揽较大的建筑工程，保证全体社员经常有工做，并带动社外五十多名小工生产。遇有建筑工程，由合作社统一承包，先由主任技工实地勘察，再召开小组长会议决定是否承包；如果决定了，即由社员提出自己的小包工计划，经会议讨论，由最省钱的承包，负责自由组织一伙社员，招一伙社外小工进行建筑（社内工人不够时，亦可联络社外工人。）工程结束后，举行会议检讨赔赚原因。该社规定社员职员除赚工资外，合作社以百分之三十五作为股金分红，百分之三十五作为劳动分红（按社员劳动日分），以百分之三十为职员分红。小包工中节省的工料由承包社员均分，节省的工时可到别处做工，所挣工资归个人。全体社员充分发挥了积极性，四月份第一期结帐得纯利一千七百万元。他们现在除了承包较大工程，并开始至外埠活动。该社目前的制度与办法中，有几点值得研究改进：（一）工资与分红全是一律匀分，一定不会完全合理，如能建立一定的奖励制度，必可更加发挥技工与工人的积极性；（二）应提倡带学徒，特别是带领一些小工学手艺；（三）提倡小工入合作社，实行小工的劳动分红，亦可提高小工劳动效率。
