　　[Ji Lu Yu Telegram] After the successful completion of the Gao Village emergency repair project in Dongming, the river's flow suddenly changed on the 4th of this month, with the main current shifting downstream and directly impacting the 13th and 14th dams. The head of the 14th dam was washed away. The democratic government swiftly led the masses in emergency repairs. Before the project was completed, the head of the 13th dam was washed away on the 6th. The danger of a breach at the Gao Village project reached an extremely serious stage. All our river management staff, local government, and the masses worked day and night to intensify repairs. On July 7th, American-made Chiang planes suddenly appeared over the project and took turns bombing and strafing the workers. The workers and material transport personnel risked their lives, fought bravely, and persisted in their work. On the 9th, the entire 13th dam project was finally completed. On the 10th, the upper mouth of the 14th dam dropped another seven meters. Our river management staff and people along the river continued to repair despite the Chiang plane attacks. As of the morning of the 11th, 101 of our workers, material transport personnel, and residents of nearby villages had been killed or injured by Chiang planes. The emergency repair project was forced to stop on the 11th. The Gao Village project is in danger of breaching at any time. The local government is actively mobilizing the masses to continue repairs. If a breach occurs due to insufficient repairs, the Chiang bandits should be fully responsible for the monstrous crime of flooding the people along the river.
    [Ji Lu Yu Telegram] The Gao Village project in Dongming is the largest dangerous project on the south bank of the Yellow River. When we recovered the area, the 7th dam had already lost its foundation, and the 10th dam was in danger. All the iron wire ropes had been cut by the Chiang bandits. The democratic government began to repair the dangerous project on June 19th, mobilizing 45,606 workers, 8,138 livestock, 302,244 jin of straw, and 267,700 bricks, repairing a total of nine dams, each raised one to one and a half meters above the water surface. The area had just been recovered, and everything was waiting to be done, with numerous difficulties. The democratic government overcame difficulties, led the masses, mobilized a large amount of manpower and materials, and completed the arduous task in just seven days. The personnel participating in the emergency repair project were very extensive. Old women in their sixties and seventies, and little girls in their teens also competed to participate. Cadres at all levels worked diligently day and night, rushing around to lead, and were self-disciplined and devoted to public service. Finally, they overcame various obstacles such as bombing and strafing by Chiang planes, and successfully completed this great project.

　　黄河如果决口蒋匪应负全责！
    蒋机狂炸高村大险工
    我抢修员工死伤百余工程被迫停止
    【冀鲁豫电】东明高村抢险工程胜利竣工后，本月四日，河势突然发生变化，大溜下移，直冲十三、十四两坝。十四的镶头坝当被冲跑，民主政府火速领导群众紧急抢修，工程未完，十三坝的镶头坝复于六日被水冲跑。高村险工决口危险，至此乃达于极端严重阶段。我全体治河员工及当地政府、群众，昼夜不停加紧抢修。美制蒋机忽于七月七日窜抵险工上空，对抢险民工轮番轰炸扫射；抢险员工及运料群众冒生命危险，英勇奋斗，坚持工作，至九日卒使十三坝工程全部完成。十日，十四坝上口又掉蛰七公尺，我治河员工及沿河群众冒蒋机袭击，继续抢修；截至十一日晨，我抢险员工、运料民工及附近村庄群众，伤亡在蒋机轰炸扫射下者已达一百零一人。抢险工程，被迫于十一日停止。高村险工随时均有决口之虞。现当地政府正积极动员群众继续抢修，如因抢修不及而决口，则淹没沿河人民的滔天大罪，蒋匪应完全负责。
    【冀鲁豫电】东明高村险工是黄河南岸第一大险工，我收复该地时，第七坝已掉垫，第十坝已出险，所有铁丝绳索都被蒋匪割光。民主政府于六月十九日领导群众开始抢修该处险工，动员民工四万五千六百零六人，牲口八千一百三十八头，秸料三○二二四四斤，砖料二六七七○○块，共抢修九个坝，每坝都修出水面一公尺到一公尺半。该地甫经收复，诸废待举，困难重重，民主政府排除困难，领导群众，动员广大人力物力，在短短的七天内即完成艰巨任务。参加抢修险工的人员非常广泛，六、七十岁的老太婆，十几岁的小女孩也争先恐后的参加。各级干部更是昼夜辛勤，奔波领导，克己奉公。终于排除蒋机轰炸扫射等各种阻挠，胜利完成此伟大工程。
