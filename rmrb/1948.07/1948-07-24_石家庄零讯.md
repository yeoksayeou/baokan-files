　　Shijiazhuang Snippets

　　No. 2 District of Shijiazhuang Promotes Social Improvement Loan Work
    △ The No. 2 District Production Promotion Cooperative of Shijiazhuang has issued credit loans of more than 829.14 million yuan in the past three months, supporting 1,786 households engaged in various productions. The focus of the loan is to support small-scale cooperative operations, small handicraft industrialists, and poor citizens engaged in production. In the past three months, it has played a certain role in supporting mass production, but there are also some problems that need to be improved urgently: (1) Some loan households (especially poor citizens and small handicraft industrialists) are unable to use loans to develop production well due to poor management and lack of guidance, resulting in losses. (2) Due to the cooperative's failure to tightly control the collection work, some loan households failed to pay on time during price increases, hoarding goods, which slowed down the cooperative's capital turnover. A few people profited from speculation, and most people wanted to borrow but could not. (3) Due to poor understanding of the situation, the objects were not well examined when issuing loans. Ma Guangtian (from Xingtai) of 14th Street borrowed 400,000 and ran away. The cooperative studied the above problems and decided on the following solutions: (1) It is necessary to clarify the policy, conduct in-depth investigations, distinguish objects, grasp key points, and oppose the gracious view of responding to all requests and the bureaucratic role of being aloof. (2) Help loan households make plans, specifically organize and guide production. (3) The street government and the Promotion Cooperative should be closely integrated, establish a certain leadership and organizational mass production meeting system, facilitate the grasping of the situation, exchange experience, and overcome certain disconnections in the past.

　　Workers of Factory 320 Contract Construction and Save Expenses
    △ When Factory 320 was building an important project, the workers of the factory automatically contracted it. After careful calculation, the project was completed ahead of schedule, fully demonstrating the enthusiasm of the working class. Before the start of work, the foremen were gathered to study in detail, make plans, and properly arrange the required tools and raw materials. Then, the construction was carried out with specific division of labor. In the work, opinions of the masses were constantly absorbed, and inappropriate parts of the original plan were revised. As a result, the project was completed ahead of schedule. If the project were contracted out, it would cost tens of millions of yuan. Now that the workers have contracted it themselves, it only cost 3,624,000 yuan, greatly saving public expenditure.

　　An Fengqing Rewarded 200,000 Yuan for Transforming Knife Grinding Factory
    △ An Fengqing, a bed washing worker at Factory 306, has been dedicated to research and has successfully used wind steel to transform a special washing knife, which has been successfully tested. When the factory was making a pulp filter, it lacked very thin washing knives. Methods such as using surface strips to make washing knives had been tried successively, but all failed. Now, because An Fengqing's transformation of a special washing knife was successful, twelve pulp filters were quickly made. The factory awarded him 200,000 border currency to commend this important creation.

　　石家庄零讯
  　石市二区推进社改进贷款工作
    △石市二区生产推进社，近三月来发放信用贷款八亿二千九百一十四万余元，扶植一千七百八十六户从事各种生产。贷款重点为扶植小型合作经营、小手工业者及贫苦市民从事生产。三个月来，在扶植群众生产上曾起了一定作用，但也有一些问题急待改进：（一）有些贷款户（特别是贫苦市民与小手工业者）因不善经营，又缺乏指导，不能很好使用贷款发展生产，以至亏了本。（二）由于该社收款工作掌握不紧，在物价上涨时，部分贷款户到期不交，囤积货物，使该社资金周转慢，少数人投机得利，多数人想贷款贷不到。（三）由于对情况了解差，在发放贷款时，未能很好审查对象，十四街马光田（邢台人）贷到四十万逃跑了。该社研究了以上的问题，决定如下克服办法：（１）必须明确方针，深入调查，区别对象，掌握重点，反对有求必应的恩赐观点及高高在上的官僚作用。（２）帮助贷款户作计划，具体组织和指导生产。（３）街政府与推进社应紧密结合，建立一定的领导与组织群众生产的会议制度，便利掌握情况，交流经验，克服过去某些脱节现象。
    三二○厂工人承包建筑节约开支
    △三二○厂在建筑某重要工程时，由该厂工人自动承包，经过精密计算，工程提早完成，充分表现出工人阶级的积极性。开工前，先召集各领班详细研究，作出计划，并将所需工具原料妥贴安排。接着就具体分工进行建筑。工作中又不断吸收群众意见，修改原计划不合适的地方，结果工程提早完成。该工程如果包出去，需用数千万元，现由工人自包，合计只用三百六十二万四千元，大大节省了公家开支。
    安凤清改造洗刀工厂特奖廿万元
    △三○六厂洗床工人安凤清专心研究，利用风钢改造专用洗刀，已试用成功。该厂制作滤浆机时，缺乏很薄的洗刀，曾先后试用表条制作洗刀等办法，均未成功。现因安凤清改造专用洗刀成功，很快制成十二块滤浆机。工厂特奖他边币二十万元，表扬这一重要创造。
