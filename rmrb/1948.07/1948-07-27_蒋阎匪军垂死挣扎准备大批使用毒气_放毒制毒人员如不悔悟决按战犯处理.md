Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Reliable news from the Jinzhong front: Chiang Kai-shek is rushing to produce a tear gas hand grenade, which will soon be used on all front lines of the bandit army in an attempt to stop the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army. This grenade does not explode. Five seconds after ignition, it releases a gas that is lighter than air, which can last for about fifty seconds. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the front lines must pay close attention to this despicable trick of the Chiang bandits. Due to repeated military failures and the declining morale of the army, Chiang Kai-shek is trying to use this heinous method to save his dying fate. Chiang's bandits have used poison gas on various battlefields. According to incomplete statistics, there have been five incidents in the past six months: (1) On February 13th of this year, in the battle near Shifo Temple, north of Shenyang, the New 1st Army, New 3rd Army, and New 6th Army used asphyxiating poison gas shells once. (2) On March 31st, in the battle of Yilin, west of Funing, the 113th Brigade of the reorganized 51st Division continuously used poison gas shells three times. (3) During the Linfen battle in April and May, Liang Peihuang, the lieutenant general deputy commander-in-chief of the 7th Army Group of the Chiang-Yan bandit army and the highest commander in Linfen, repeatedly used tear gas, sneezing gas, and asphyxiating gas against our army. Chiang's planes also transported poison gas and poison gas shells to the city for Liang's use. During our army's siege of the city, Liang ordered Duan Liqing, a physics and chemistry teacher at Linfen Normal School, to manufacture 60 bottles of tear gas. Liang and Duan have now been captured, and the evidence is complete. They will be handed over to the military court and punished as war criminals according to the law. (4) On June 25th, the enemy defending Xiguan, Yanzhou, fired poison gas shells at our army. (5) In early July, in the battle in the Hei Hu Yan area on the outskirts of Xiangyang, Kang Ze, Chiang Kai-shek's head of intelligence, ordered the 104th Brigade to release a large amount of poison gas against our army. It is worth noting the propaganda coordination of the bandit's rumor-mongering agency, the Central News Agency, regarding this crime. Whenever the bandit army is in military crisis and preparing to use poison gas, it first fabricates the myth that the People's Liberation Army used "poison gas" as a public opinion preparation for its actual actions. On April 29th of this year, when we were besieging the defenders of Ying County most tightly, the Central News Agency did this, which was actually the Yan bandits using poison gas in Linfen. Now, as our Jinzhong army approaches Taiyuan, the Central News Agency's Taiyuan dispatch on the 13th is spreading the same rumors, and its conspiracy is worthy of vigilance. Military sources say: As early as June 1925, countries around the world jointly stipulated "prohibiting the use of poison gas or other gas or germ warfare methods." We now once again warn those Chiang-Yan officers who command the release of poison gas and those who manufacture poison gas to repent as soon as possible and immediately stop this criminal behavior that violates international law. Otherwise, the People's Liberation Army will treat such culprits as war criminals and will not be lenient.

　　蒋阎匪军垂死挣扎准备大批使用毒气
  　放毒制毒人员如不悔悟决按战犯处理
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】晋中前线确息：蒋介石正在赶制一种催泪性毒气手榴弹，即将在匪军各个前线使用，以图阻挡人民解放军的胜利进攻。该弹并不爆炸，拉火后五秒钟即放射一种较空气为轻的毒气，可以持续约五十秒钟。人民解放军前方将士必须严密注意蒋匪军此种卑鄙手段。由于军事节节失利，军队士气日益低落，蒋介石正企图用此种罪恶手段挽救其垂死命运。蒋匪在各个战场，施放毒气，据不完全统计，半年内已有五次。（一）今年二月十三日沈阳以北之石佛寺附近战斗，新一军、新三军、新六军等部使用窒息性毒气炮弹一次。（二）三月三十一日阜宁西之益林战斗，整五十一师一一三旅连续使用毒气弹三次。（三）四、五月临汾战斗，蒋阎匪军第七集团军中将副总司令兼临汾最高指挥官梁培璜曾一再向我军施放催泪、喷嚏、窒息等毒气，蒋机并向该城输送毒气与毒气弹，供梁使用。在我军攻城期间，梁下令临汾师范理化教员段利清制造催泪性毒气六十瓶。现梁段均已生俘，人物证件俱在，即将交付军事法庭，按战犯依法治罪。（四）六月二十五日兖州西关守敌向我军发射毒气炮弹。（五）七月上旬襄阳外围黑虎堰地区战斗，蒋介石的特务头子康泽下令一○四旅向我军施放大量毒气。值得注意的是匪方造谣机关中央社对此种罪行在宣传上的配合。凡属匪方军事危急准备施放毒气时，它就事先捏造所谓解放军使用“毒气”的神话，作其实际行动的舆论准备。今年四月二十九日我围攻应县守敌最紧之际，中央社即曾这样做过，实则是阎匪在临汾施放毒气。现在，我晋中大军逼近太原，中央社十三日太原电，又在散播同样的谣言，其阴谋值得警惕。军方人士称：早在一九二五年六月，世界各国就曾共同规定“禁止运用毒气，或其他瓦斯、微菌战争方法”我们现在再一次警告那些指挥施放毒气的蒋阎军官和制造毒气的人员，应及早悔悟，立即停止这种违犯国际公法的罪恶行为。否则人民解放军对此等祸首决按战犯处理，不稍宽容。
