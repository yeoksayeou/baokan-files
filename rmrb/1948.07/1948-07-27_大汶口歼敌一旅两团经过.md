Xinhua News Agency, Jinpu Front, 19th. Frontline reporters reported on the annihilation of an enemy brigade and two regiments by the People's Liberation Army near Dawenkou, stating: After the People's Liberation Army besieged Yanzhou, Chiang Kai-shek and Liu Zhi ordered the habitually defeated General Wang Yaowu to gather his newly restored 96th Division (under the jurisdiction of the 155th Brigade and 161st Brigade of the 84th Division, and the 211th Brigade and 213th Brigade of the 2nd Division), a force of four brigades, led by Wu Huawen, the commander of the army and commander of the 84th Division, a notorious puppet army leader, to relieve Ji'nan from the south. They advanced at a snail's pace, taking a full ten days to cover the mere 80-odd li from Zhangxia Station south of Jinan to Tai'an. On the 11th, the bandits sneaked into and occupied Tai'an City and continued to advance south to the Dawenkou area. On the 13th, at dusk, the People's Liberation Army captured Yanzhou, annihilating all the defending enemies. The Wu bandits immediately turned around and scurried north. Our army chased fiercely through the rain that night, surrounding the enemy's entire 161st Brigade, two regiments of the 155th Brigade, and a portion of the 211th Brigade in the northern and southern Dawenkou areas. After two days of fierce fighting on the 14th and 15th, all the encircled enemies were annihilated. Note: The original 96th Division was under the jurisdiction of the 211th Brigade and 212th Brigade of the 45th Division, and the 57th Brigade and 213th Brigade of the 2nd Division, a total of four brigades. During the Weixian campaign in April, the army headquarters, the 45th Division headquarters, and the entire 212th Brigade were annihilated, and the army commander and division commander Chen Jincheng was captured. The remaining troops were spared because they were stationed in Qingdao and Jinan. Recently, it was reorganized in Jinan, and the 96th Division designation was restored with the 84th Division.
