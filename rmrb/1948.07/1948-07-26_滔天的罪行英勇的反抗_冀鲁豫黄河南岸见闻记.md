　　Towering Crimes, Heroic Resistance
  　Eyewitness Account from the Southern Bank of the Yellow River in the Ji-Lu-Yu Region
    In the Henan region of Ji-Lu-Yu, the Chiang bandits are carrying out inhuman acts of rape, murder, arson, and looting against the people. To defend their lives, property, and the happiness of future generations, the broad masses of people have launched a tenacious and unyielding struggle.
    "Anything that belongs to the common people, they will rob it." This is the conclusion of the people of Henan regarding the Chiang bandits' looting atrocities. This spring, the 87th Regiment of the 68th Division of the Chiang bandits looted forty cartloads of timber from the Xiniu Lou Village in Linze. On the sixteenth day of the second month of the lunar calendar, the Chiang-sponsored Security Brigade, in collaboration with the puppet Second District of Cao County, robbed 160 bags of grain, 200 catties of cotton thread, more than 300 sacks, 30 sheep, 7 cattle, and 1 cart from Xiaoma Village in the Fifth District of Kaocheng. Five cattle and 7,000 catties of grain were robbed from Qianlu Temple in the Shijun District of Qibin County. The door panels in the southern half of Yuncheng County have been almost completely looted, with 120 pairs taken from Dawang Village alone. A total of fifteen households in Tawanji, Fifth District of Kaocheng County, were robbed, and according to the statistics of eleven households, the enemy robbed them of 30,065 catties of grain, 21 head of cattle and donkeys, 9 large and small carts, and 632 feet of white cloth. Jinan County lost as many as 700 head of draught cattle.
    The Chiang Kai-shek gang desperately arrests young people to use them as cannon fodder. More than 500 young men were arrested by the enemy in the First District of Linze, with villages losing as many as 30 to 40 people each, and as few as two or three. One day, the enemy in Heze suddenly rushed into the villages of Dongmagai and Ximagai in Linze, forcibly assembled the masses for a meeting, and forced 146 young and middle-aged men to Heze at gunpoint. The whole village was filled with crying and cursing of the Chiang bandits' heinous crimes. Later, the Chiang bandits extorted 100 million yuan in Chiang currency from Dongmagai before releasing some of the captured men. A total of 400 young men were arrested by the enemy in Jinan County. Fifty people were arrested in Chengwu County. From the first to the fourth month of the lunar calendar, 16,500 young men were arrested by the Chiang bandits' Fifth and Eighty-fourth Divisions in Qibin County.
    On April 11th, the puppet Second District of Cao County, in collaboration with the puppet Security Brigade, ransacked 73 households in Hou Dai Village, Fifth District of Kaocheng County, burning down 58 houses and smashing 70 pots. The village had 56 households who made a living by carpentry. All of their carpentry furniture was burned. On the sixteenth day of the second month of the lunar calendar, the puppet Second District of Cao County, in collaboration with a part of the Chiang bandits' Eighty-fourth Division Security Brigade, bloodbathed Xiaoma Village in Kaocheng County (a small village of 50 households), burning down 25 houses. A 79-year-old woman was burned to death, and all eight rooms of the village chief, Ma Xingfeng, were burned down. Village chief Ma Xingfeng, self-defense captain Ma Jingao, village office secretary Ma Huixuan, and nine other cadres and people were brutally murdered. In Changliu Village, Shan-Yu County (a new county), all the houses of 200 households were burned down. Most of the iron pots in Xiaoma Village were destroyed, and the people were forced to take turns cooking meals.
    When the Chiang bandits' Fifth and Sixty-eighth Divisions and the 143rd Brigade passed through Qibin County, they gathered all the women in Guofenglou Village and raped them in turn. A fourteen-year-old girl in Dacao Village, Dingtao County, was gang-raped by a platoon of the Chiang bandits' Fifth Division. When her elderly grandfather stepped forward to try to stop them, he was beaten away with belts by the beasts. A young woman in Luji Village, Chengwu County, committed suicide out of shame and indignation after being raped by the Chiang bandits' Fifth Division. There are too many such incidents, and I, the reporter, cannot bear to write them down.
    The people of Henan have not succumbed. They understand that the only way to deal with man-eating beasts is with swords and knives. A heroic and magnificent struggle is unfolding vigorously.
    Ma Sicun, the village chief of Xima Village, Linze County, was captured by the Heze Chiang bandits on March 30th. The bandits beat him in every way possible, asking where the village's public grain was hidden. He remained unyielding until his death, without uttering a single word. After his heroic sacrifice, the villagers raised money to bury him and held a public memorial service. On the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, the Chiang bandits' Sixty-eighth Division and 143rd Brigade, in collaboration with local bandits, sneaked into Qianlu Temple Village, Qibin County, and forced all the villagers to gather in a field, demanding to know where the public grain was buried. All 160 people in the village were as strong as steel, and no one revealed any clues. The enemy used bayonets, rifle butts, belts, and wooden sticks, beating more than 100 people, regardless of gender or age. Four elderly people over the age of sixty, Lu Yuming, Lu Liuqing, Lu Xinzai, and Lu Fubin, were beaten half to death and covered in blood. The elderly Lu Yuming still keeps a bloody sock. When the reporter went to interview him, the old woman Lu pointed to the bloody sock and said, "I will never forget the hatred of this bloody sock!" The son of the village chief of Sun Village, Qibin County, was killed by the enemy. The father immediately went to the democratic district office to request arms and organized a revenge team of seven or eight people, who fought bravely against the enemy. One evening, Mr. Yan, an old gentleman from a village in Yuncheng County, invited two officers from the Chiang bandits' Fifth Division for a drink. After the enemy got drunk, the whole family took out the pre-prepared iron shovels and grappling hooks and secretly buried the enemy alive in the ground. A certain village militia relied on the tunnels in their village to persist in the struggle in the enemy's rear. On the twenty-second day of the third month of the lunar calendar, 300 men of the local bandit Zhang Shengtai's force attacked the village, determined to burn down the houses and destroy the tunnels. The bandit Zhang personally directed the charge toward the central street five or six times, but was bravely repelled by the militia. The enemy suffered more than 70 casualties and fled in disarray. During the wheat harvest, the villagers, under the protection of the militia, safely brought the wheat home without suffering any losses.

　　滔天的罪行英勇的反抗
  　冀鲁豫黄河南岸见闻记
    在冀鲁豫河南地区，蒋匪正对人民实行灭绝人性的奸淫、烧杀和抢掠。广大人民为了保卫自己的生命、财产和后代子孙的幸福，展开顽强的英勇不屈的斗争。
    “只要是老百姓的东西，他没有不抢的”。这是河南人民对蒋匪抢掠暴行的结论。今春蒋匪六十八师八七团在临泽西牛楼村抢去木材四十大车。旧历二月十六日，蒋记保安旅配合曹县伪二区所，到考城五区小马庄抢去一百六十布袋粮食、二百斤棉线、三百多条布袋、三十只羊、七头牛、一辆车。齐滨县石钧区前逯庙被抢去五头牛、七千斤粮食。郓城南半部的门板快被抢光了，仅大王庄一村就被抢去一百二十合。考城五区塔湾集共十五户，据十一户的统计，被敌抢去粮食三万零六十五斤，牛驴二十一头，大小车九辆，白布六百三十二尺。钜南损失耕牛达七百头。
    蒋家匪帮拼命的抓捕青年替他当炮灰。临泽一区被敌抓去壮丁五百多人，每村多者三四十人，少者两三人。有一天菏泽敌人突然窜进临泽东西马垓村，强迫群众集合开会，将一百四十六个青壮年用枪逼住押往菏泽。全村哭声震天，咒骂蒋匪滔天罪行。后来蒋匪在东马垓敲榨了一万万元蒋币，才把抓去的壮丁放回一部。钜南全县被敌抓去青壮年四百人。城武则被抓去五十人。齐滨县从正月到四月，被蒋匪整五师八十四师抓去壮丁一万六千五百人。
    四月十一日，曹县伪二区部配合伪保安旅，洗劫考城五区七十三户的后戴庄，烧毁五十八间房，打碎七十口锅。该村有户五十六，靠做木匠活为生，所有木匠家具都被烧毁了。旧历二月十六日，曹县伪二区部配合蒋匪八十四师保安旅一部，血洗考城小马庄（这是个五十户的小村），烧毁房屋二十五间，一个七十九岁的老太太被烧死了，村长马兴逢的八间屋子全烧光了。村长马兴逢、自卫队长马近诰、村公所书记马会轩等十二个干部群众，被残杀了。单虞县（新县）常刘村二百户人家，房屋全被烧光。小马庄的铁锅大部被毁，群众被迫轮流煮饭吃。
    蒋匪整五师和六八师一四三旅从齐滨过境时，到国冯楼把全村妇女集中起来，施行轮奸。定陶大曹庄一个十四岁的女孩子，遭蒋匪整五师一个班轮奸，年老的祖父上前企图劝阻，竟被野兽们用皮带打出去。城武陆集一个青年妇女遭蒋匪整五师强奸后，羞愤自杀。这种事情太多，记者不忍写下去了。
    河南人民并没有屈服。他们懂得对于吃人的野兽，只能用刀剑来对待它。英勇壮烈的战斗如火如荼的展开了。
    临泽西马海村长马思存，在三月三十日被菏泽蒋匪捉住，匪徒们百般毒打，追问该村公粮放在哪里？他至死不屈，没有吐露一个字。壮烈牺牲之后，全村群众集资安葬，并实行公祭。旧历四月初八，蒋匪六八师一四三旅结合土顽窜入齐滨前逯庙村，强迫全村群众集合在一个场里追问公粮埋在什么地方，全村一百六十口人，都象钢铁一样的坚强，没有一个人说出任何的线索，敌人用刺刀、枪托、皮带、木棍，不分男女老少打了一百多个人，年过花甲逯玉明、逯留卿、逯新在、逯福彬等四人被打得死去活来，满身是血。逯玉明老人至今还保存着一只血袜，当记者去访问他时，逯老太太指着血袜说：“我啥时候也忘不了这血袜的仇！”齐滨孙庄村长的儿子被敌人打死了，父亲立即到民主区公所要求武装，组织了七、八个人的复仇队，和敌人英勇的战斗起来。郓城某村颜老先生，在一天晚上请蒋匪整五师两个军官喝酒，等敌人喝醉后，全家把预先准备好的铁铣抓钩拿出来，偷偷的把敌人活埋在地里。某村民兵依靠本村地道，坚持腹地斗争，旧历三月二十二日，土顽张盛泰部三百人进攻该村，决心烧掉房子，破坏地道。张匪亲自指挥向中心街冲锋五六次，都被民兵英勇击退，敌伤七十多人狼狈逃窜。麦收中该村群众在民兵保护下，安全把麦收到家里，没受一点损失。
