　　By Whose Decree Was I Driven Out?
　　To the Editor,
　　I am a poor peasant from Monan Village, Sixth District, Xian County, Jizhong. There is a matter I want to complain about to you. I have a brother, Li Xuewen, who was originally a soldier in the People's Liberation Army. He took leave to return home last year, and after the leave expired, he did not return. This May, the conscription work in our village began. The way of conscription was nominally called "self-reporting and public discussion," but in reality, it was cadres leading everyone to denounce people. My brother, being a soldier who overstayed his leave, naturally became the primary target of conscription. However, my brother's mind was not clear at the time. After hearing that someone had voted for him to return to the army, he became agitated and cursed a few times. Who knew that this cursing would cause a great deal of trouble for our whole family? The village cadres, on one hand, detained my mother and my brother, and on the other hand, ran to the district to discuss, saying, "If we don't severely strike at his family, the conscription work cannot be done." After they discussed this and returned, they paraded my brother through the streets and forced me to join the army as well. I did not accept this approach at the time. The village cadres became angry out of embarrassment, sent my brother to the county People's Court, sealed off our entire house, confiscated all our grain and farm tools, and even announced that the land allocated to us during the land reform would be taken back and given to others. In this way, our whole family was driven out of the village amidst tears and cries.
　　We reported this matter to the county. Comrade Liu, the county party secretary, instructed the district, "Let Li Xuewen return to the army and apologize and admit his mistakes to all the villagers." I felt that this handling was fair, because naturally one should return to the army if the superiors called for it after one had left the ranks. At the same time, one should apologize and admit one's mistakes if one's mouth was unclean and one cursed others. But who knew that such an instruction from the county party secretary would be ignored by the district? The district committee said, "It's not worth burning a coat for a louse!" As a result, our whole family had no choice but to wander around outside, watching helplessly as the land became barren and the farm tools were lost piece by piece, and half of our five or six mu of wheat was harvested by others. Later, Comrade Han, the deputy county party secretary, personally went to the village to resolve this issue, but he also ran into a snag. The village cadres said, "If we solve it this way, we will all move out of the village and stop working." "This is what the district committee told us to do, we are not responsible, you go and talk to the masses yourself!" Afterwards, we went to the county party committee several times. The county party committee's attitude was very firm. At the end of June, they wrote a letter to the village cadres saying, "If the village cadres have any opinions, they can come to the county to discuss them. If they don't implement it any further, they will be punished!" After receiving the letter, the village cadres ran to the county for a while, spending a lot of time, and finally reluctantly agreed to the county's handling method in words. But what was the actual result? The village cadres became even angrier when they returned from the county. Not only did they not implement the county's instructions, but they also took the confiscated grain of mine and sold it. To this day, the door has not been unsealed. Editor, my brother made a mistake during the conscription, and we are willing to admit our mistake. The county party committee's method of handling this issue is fair, and we sincerely support it. But now we don't understand, the county party committee has decided that our property should not be confiscated, but the district committee and village cadres insist on their own opinions, driving us out of the house, and it has been two or three months now without unsealing the door. Whose decree are they executing after all?

### 把我扫地出门是谁的法令？

　　把我扫地出门是谁的法令？
    献县陌南村  李学忠编辑同志：
    我是冀中献县六区陌南村的一个贫农，现在有一件事情要向你们控诉。我有一个兄弟李学文原来在解放军当战士，去年请假回家，以后期满也没回去。今年阳历五月我村扩军工作开始，扩的方式名义上叫作“自报公议”，实际上是干部领头大家检举，我兄弟是逾期不归的战士，当然首先成为扩军的对象。但是我兄弟的脑筋当时没有转开，背后听说有人投票要他归队，于是激动起来骂了几句。谁知道这一骂可不要紧，给我们全家把天大的乱子闯下来了。村干部一方面扣了俺娘和俺兄弟，一方面跑到区里商量说：“不重重的打击他家，扩军工作就做不了。”他们从这里商量好了回来，把我兄弟拉着游街，逼着我也去参军。我当时没有接受这种做法，村干部们羞恼成怒，把我兄弟送到县人民法庭，把我们全家也封了门，所有的粮食农具被没收了，连土改中间分给俺的一份土地也宣布要收回去，另外分给别人。就这样，我们全家哭哭啼啼的被赶出村。
    这件事情我们曾经告到县上，县委书记刘同志给区里的指示是：“让李学文归队，并向全村群众道歉认错。”我觉得这样处理是公平的，因为从队伍上下来上级叫归队自然要归队，同时嘴不干净骂了人家自然应该道歉认错。但谁知道县委书记的这样一个指示到了区里没人理睬，区委说：“搞不通，不能为一个虱子烧了袄！”结果我们全家没有办法，整天流浪在外，眼巴巴的看着土地荒芜，农具家伙一件件的遗失，五六亩麦子被别人割去一半。后来县委副书记韩同志曾经到村里亲自去解决过这个问题，但是也碰了钉子，村干部说：“要这么解决我们就都搬出村去不干工作了。”“这是区委叫干的，俺们不负责任，你自己去给群众说吧！”以后我们又找过县委几回，县委的态度很坚决，六月底，给村干部写了一封信说：“村干部有意见可到县上来谈，再不执行就受制裁！”村干部接到信到县上跑了一回，费了半天时间，总算口头上勉强答应了县上的处理办法。但是实际结果怎样了呢？村干部从县里回来气更大了，不仅没有执行县上的指示，并且把没收的我的粮食拿去粜了，至今门也不启封。编者同志，在扩军中我兄弟是犯了错误的，我们愿意承认错误。县委在处理这个问题的办法上是公平的，我们诚心拥护。但是现在我们不了解，县委决定了不准没收我们的财产，但是区委和村干部一个劲坚持他们自己的意见，把我们扫地出了门，现在两三个月了也不给启封，他们执行的到底是谁的法令？
