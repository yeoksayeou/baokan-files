　　【Shijiazhuang News】Men Donggui, an old worker who has served in the railway industry for more than 40 years under the rule of the Kuomintang and the Japanese puppets and never got ahead, has been promoted to section chief by the democratic government's railway bureau. Men Donggui is 69 years old this year. He started as a worker on a track maintenance team in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign. Despite his hard work, he was still beaten and bullied, and there was no hope of getting ahead. During the Japanese occupation, he was falsely accused of being a "Eighth Route Army" member, suffered severe torture, and was imprisoned. After the Kuomintang "took over," they said he was "too old to be hired" and dismissed him under that pretext. He received no retirement pension, and his family relied entirely on selling clothes to make a living. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, he actively led workers in construction based on his many years of experience and overcame many difficulties. The workers elected him as the engineering team leader and affectionately called him "Leader Men." On the 18th of last month, the Railway Bureau decided to promote him to section chief. When he returned to the bureau from his work location to report on his work, the reporter paid him a special visit. He was chatting with a comrade from the United University about his decades of hardship and his current happiness. He said: "I couldn't get promoted before! Without money to 'lobby,' you don't stand a chance!" Then he said with a smile: "Now it is very different from before. The workers are working with enthusiasm and feel happy!"

　　作工四十年今日出了头工人门东贵荣升段长
    【石家庄讯】在国民党及日伪统治下，服务铁路事业四十余年从未出头的老工人门东贵，已由民主政府铁路局升为段长。门东贵今年六十九岁，光绪二十九年上道班当工人，百般苦干还得挨打受气，根本谈不到出头。日寇统治时，他被硬说成“八路”，受尽严刑，坐过大狱。国民党“劫收”后，说他“年龄过老，不堪录用”，借口遣散，退休养老金分文未给，一家人全靠卖衣服度日。石家庄解放后，他凭着多年经验，积极领导工人从事建设，战胜许多困难，工人们选他当工程队长，亲切地叫他“门头”。上月十八日路局决定升任段长。这次他从工作地点回局报告工作，记者特往拜访，他正对一个联大的同志畅叙数十年的艰苦与现在的愉快，他说：“早先升不了啊！没有钱‘运动’算是不沾！”接着他又笑嘻嘻地说：“现在和从前大大不同了，工人们干着有劲，心里痛快了！”
