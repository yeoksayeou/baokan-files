　　Jixian County is killing pests
    Many villages in various districts of Jixian County have discovered pests, and many bean and cotton leaves have been eaten. Cadres at all levels are mobilizing the masses to kill them. In Zhifangtou, Mengling, and Sishang villages in the Third District, men, women, old and young are mobilized to work together in an organized manner to first catch the white grub and implement a method of exterminating them area by area. Dense insects were found in the First, Second, and Third Districts, which harmed the cotton and bean pods, preventing them from growing. The masses can use ash (ash from burning firewood in a pot) sprinkled on the cotton and bean seedlings to extinguish them. Mole crickets have been universally discovered in all districts of the county, and are being actively captured.

　　冀县捕杀害虫
    冀县各区不少村庄发现害虫，很多豆子、棉花叶被吃掉，各级干部正发动群众捕灭中。三区纸方头、孟领、寺上等村，发动男女老幼齐动手，有组织的先捉白麻子虫，实行片片捕灭的办法。一、二、三区发现密虫，将棉花、豆角害得都不长了。群众用灰（烧锅的柴火灰）洒在棉花和豆角子秧上即可扑灭。全县各区普遍发现蝼蛄，都在积极捕捉中。
