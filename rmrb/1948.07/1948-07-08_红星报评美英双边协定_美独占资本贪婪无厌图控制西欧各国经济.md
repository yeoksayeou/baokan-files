　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. TASS reports: The Red Star newspaper published an article on June 24th entitled "The Financial Times' Belated Reaction," stating: When negotiations for the Anglo-American bilateral agreement entered a heated stage in Washington, the Financial Times, the mouthpiece of British financiers, suddenly issued a deafening cry. The newspaper's editorial said: The obligations stipulated by the bilateral agreement coming from Washington have caused disappointment bordering on fear in London. The Red Star newspaper asked: What tasks have made this London financial journal stop praising the American "aid" plan? The answer is that American monopoly capital insists on being given the power to arbitrarily control the economies of various countries under the Marshall Plan and to impose its will on these countries. Therefore, the British newspaper reasonably concludes that the United States is now trying to make Britain permanently dependent on American aid. This is a most noteworthy admission, but it is now somewhat late. The United States has long since begun to seize one position after another from Britain. Trade between the British Dominions and colonies is gradually shifting from Britain to the United States. American exports to British Empire dependencies have increased more than five times compared to before the war, exceeding British exports by nearly one hundred percent. Britain has in fact ceded control of the Sterling Area to the United States, and at the Havana International Trade Conference, the United States forced Britain to make significant concessions on imperial preferences. Now, British merchants finally believe that the price they have paid for acting as the United States' accountant in Europe is too high. The Red Star newspaper pointed out that the Financial Times' implication of "resolutely opposing" American policy is hoping to obtain some concessions from the United States. The Red Star newspaper said: Isn't it too late?

　　红星报评美英双边协定
    美独占资本贪婪无厌图控制西欧各国经济
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社讯：红星报于六月二十四日发表题为“财政时报为时已晚的反响”的论文称：当英美两国双边协定的谈判在华盛顿进入热闹阶段时，英国金融家的喉舌财政时报突然发出了震耳的叫喊声。该报社论说：华盛顿传来的双边协定所规定的义务，在伦敦引起了近于恐惧的失望。红星报问道：有些什么任务使得这个伦敦金融机关报停止对美国“援助”计划的歌颂呢？这就是：美国独占资本坚持必须赋予他们随意控制马歇尔计划下各国经济的权力，并将它的意志强加于这些国家。因此，这个英国报纸得出合理的结论说：美国现正竭力使英国永远依赖美援。这是一件最可注意的承认，可是，现在已经有些嫌迟了。美国早已开始从英国手中夺去一个又一个的阵地。英国自治领与殖民地的贸易，正逐渐从英国转入美国之手。美国对不列颠帝国属国的输出，比战前增加了五倍以上，超出英国输出几达百分之百。英国实际上已将英镑集团的控制权割让给美国，在哈瓦那国际贸易会议中，美国又迫使英国在帝国特惠制上作了重大的让步。现在，英国商人终于相信，他们为了充任美国在欧洲管帐人所付出的代价是太高了。红星报指出：金融时报暗示“坚决反对”美国政策，是希望借此取得美国某些让步。红星报说：这样岂不嫌太迟了吗？
