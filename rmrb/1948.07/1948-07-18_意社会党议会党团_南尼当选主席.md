Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, Rome - Despite obstruction from the Italian Socialist Party's executive committee, composed entirely of "centrist" representatives, the party's parliamentary group overwhelmingly elected the left-wing leader Nenni as chairman on the 12th of this month. Subsequently, the Socialist Party's leadership issued a special communique stating that Nenni's election violated the wishes of the party's leading organs, which had requested that the election be postponed until the next parliamentary session. Note: The Italian Parliament is about to adjourn.

    南尼当选主席
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利社会党议会党团不顾该党清一色的“中间派”代表组成的执委会之阻挠，于本月十二日以压倒多数推选该党左翼领袖南尼为主席。事后，社会党领导机构竟发表特别公报说：南尼的选出违反了该党领导机关的意愿，后者曾要求将这项选举延至下次议会开会时举行。按：意大利议会行将闭幕。
