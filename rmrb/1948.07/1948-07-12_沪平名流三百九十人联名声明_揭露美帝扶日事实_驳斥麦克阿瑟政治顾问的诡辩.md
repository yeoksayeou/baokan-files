Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai: 390 prominent figures from Shanghai, Beiping, and other places jointly published a lengthy statement in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 2nd, refuting the sophistry made by MacArthur's political advisor in Tokyo on June 15 regarding U.S. policy towards Japan. (Note: Earlier last month, 291 prominent figures from cultural and educational circles in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places jointly issued a statement, powerfully exposing the truth about the U.S. fostering the revival of Japanese aggressive forces. The U.S. authorities were extremely embarrassed, and MacArthur ordered his political advisor to issue a statement, falsely accusing the Chinese figures' statement of being "based on distorted facts.") The statement condemned the U.S. military headquarters in Japan for "failing to act under the supervision of the Allied Control Council" and pointed out that "the United States is taking unilateral and arbitrary actions in Japan, violating the Potsdam Declaration and the directives and policies set by the Far Eastern Commission." It pointed out that MacArthur's headquarters disregarded decisions regarding demobilization, dissolution of zaibatsu, land reform, and other issues. The statement reiterated the facts that the United States retained Japanese aircraft and tank manufacturing factories, restored Japanese police forces and police schools, and refused to take "drastic" measures to interrogate and punish Japanese war criminals. It also pointed out that the United States was afraid that outsiders would learn about these facts and "prohibited Allied reporters from freely entering Japan."

　　沪平名流三百九十人联名声明
    揭露美帝扶日事实
    驳斥麦克阿瑟政治顾问的诡辩
    【新华社陕北十日电】据路透社上海消息：上海、北平等地名流三百九十人联名于二日在上海大公报上发表长篇声明，驳斥六月十五日麦克阿瑟政治顾问在东京所发表的公开声明中对美国对日政策所作的诡辩。（按上月初上海、南京、北平、广州、厦门等地文化教育界名流二百九十一人联合发表声明，有力的揭穿了美国扶植日本侵略势力复活的真象后，美国当局极为狼狈，麦克阿瑟乃命其政治顾问发表声明，反诬中国名流声明“系以歪曲之事实为基础”。）声明谴责驻日美军总部“未能在盟国管制委员会的监督下行动”，“美国在日本采取片面的专横的行动，违反了波茨顿宣言及远东委员会所定的指令与政策”。指出麦克阿瑟总部一对关于复员、解散财阀、土地改革、及其他问题的决定一概不予置理。声明再次列举美国保留日本飞机和坦克制造工厂、恢复日本警察部队和警察学校，拒绝采取“激烈”方法审讯和惩罚日本战犯等事实。并指出美国很怕外人获知这些事实“不准盟国记者自由进入日本”。
