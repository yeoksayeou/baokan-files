Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, 21st: During the Eastern Henan Campaign, commanders at all levels of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, who were tasked with holding actions, set an example by taking the lead, greatly encouraging and inspiring the soldiers' morale to kill the enemy with their arduous and exemplary behavior. During the blocking action at Xugang on the 3rd, Guo Jisheng, the battalion commander of the unit, suddenly fainted on the battlefield due to the hot weather and days of excessive combat fatigue. When he woke up, he found himself being carried to the rear, but his high sense of revolutionary responsibility made him completely forget his fatigue, and he returned to the front line to direct the battle the next morning. Kong Xiangtan, a combat hero and battalion commander of a certain battalion, was wounded in the Kaifeng Campaign. Although his wound had not yet healed, upon hearing that there was another combat mission, he rushed from the rear hospital to the front, requesting to return to the battalion to direct the battle. The higher authorities repeatedly tried to dissuade him, but he firmly refused. On July 2, when the 189th Regiment of the 83rd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army fiercely attacked our army's position near Guanzhuang, Battalion Commander Kong Xiangtan braved intense artillery fire and returned to his combat command post. During the most intense fighting in the Xugang battle, Wang, the division commander of our certain division, personally went to the forefront to direct the troops, separated from the enemy only by a dry river. Such examples were extremely common throughout the entire campaign. Since the Kaifeng Campaign, although the unit had been marching and fighting continuously for more than 20 days, it was still able to overcome difficulties and fatigue, and its combat morale remained as high as ever. This spirit of leading cadres setting an example is one of the main reasons.

　　豫东我军某部战斗中
  　领导干部以身作则
    【新华社豫东前线二十一日电】豫东战役中担任阻击任务的解放军某部各级指挥员，身先士卒，以他们艰苦卓绝的模范行为大大鼓舞与振奋了战士们的杀敌情绪。该部郭继胜营长在三日许岗阻击战中，由于天气炎热与连日作战过度疲劳，突然在战场上晕厥。当他醒来时，发觉自己被抬到后方，但是高度的革命责任心使他完全忘记了疲劳，次日清晨又重回前线指挥作战。某营营长战斗英雄孔祥坦在开封战役中负了伤，虽伤口尚未痊愈，但听到又有战斗任务，就急急从后方卫生队赶到前方，要求回营指挥作战。上级再三劝阻，他都坚决拒绝。七月二日当蒋军八三师一八九团猛犯官庄一带我军阵地时，孔祥坦营长即冒激烈炮火回到他的战斗指挥岗位。在许岗争夺战最激烈的时候，我某师王师长亲临最前线指挥部队，与敌人仅隔一条干河。在整个战役过程中这种范例极为普遍。该部自开封战役以来，虽在二十余天连续行军作战中，而仍能克服困难与疲劳，战斗情绪始终高涨如一，领导干部的这种以身作则的精神是主要原因之一。
