The Battle of Beiying Village

On June 21st, after the entire 72nd Division of Yan Xishan's "Personally Trained Division" was annihilated by the People's Liberation Army between Pingyao and Jiexiu, the Yan bandit 19th Army headquarters, the 40th Division headquarters and its entire 2nd Regiment, and two companies of the 3rd Regiment, stationed in Pingyao, fearing annihilation by our forces, hurriedly departed from Pingyao and fled towards Qixian along the west side of the Tongpu Railway in three columns. However, as they entered the area seven miles northwest of Hongshan Station, they were fiercely intercepted by a unit of our People's Liberation Army, which quickly drove a wedge into the ranks of the Yan bandits. The Yan bandit ranks were thrown into chaos and turned to flee west. We immediately pursued them closely, and with the exception of a small number of enemies who escaped at the front and rear, the main force of the enemy, more than 3,000 men, was completely compressed and surrounded in Beiying Village. At dawn on the 24th, our army launched a general offensive against the surrounded enemy. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, our assault team first broke into the village from the southeast corner. The "Zhao Shiping Class," which had made great contributions in the Linfen Campaign and won the glorious title, discovered that the enemy was fleeing north as they rushed to the edge of the village. They quickly charged towards the enemy, scattering them in all directions, capturing over a hundred enemies including a company commander. Liu Qinhe, a newly liberated soldier of a certain unit, whose rifle was broken, threw a grenade into a pile of enemies, instantly killing five and wounding more than ten. He then fired five shots in succession with a captured rifle, killing six more enemies. The remaining enemies prostrated themselves and begged for mercy, laying down their weapons.

The enemy within the village, under the bombardment of our artillery fire and the heroic assaults of our assault teams, suffered heavy casualties and had long since collapsed. A group of enemies broke out of the village to the southwest, but were met head-on by our ambushing troops as soon as they left the village, and had to retreat back into the village. At this time, most of the houses in the village had been occupied by our forces. A group of enemies poured out of the village and fled west. Zhao Yuzhen, a newly liberated soldier of a certain unit of our army, set up a short, thick infantry gun and aimed at the fleeing enemy, firing seven rounds in succession, each round landing in the midst of the chaotic enemy ranks. Forty or fifty enemies were seen lying on the ground in disorder. Our light and heavy machine guns also opened fire at the same time, and no matter how fast the enemy ran, they could not escape the pursuit of our bullets. Countless enemies died for Yan Xishan, the bloodsucker of the people of Shanxi, in the wheat fields, on the roads, and by the ridges.

Following this, our infantry assault teams closely pursued them. The panicked enemies completely lost their combat effectiveness. Niu Longxi, the squad leader of the sixth squad of a certain unit of our army, saw the enemy dragging a mountain gun during the pursuit. Having run out of grenades and overheated his gun barrel, he temporarily picked up a clod of earth and threw it at the enemy. The panicked enemy immediately lay on the ground, not daring to move. Niu Longxi thus captured a mountain gun. Finally, the Yan bandits who were fortunate enough not to be killed by our firepower were all taken prisoner. At approximately 9:00 AM, the battle was completely resolved.

　　北营村歼灭战
    六月二十一日，阎匪“亲训师”七十二师，在平遥、介休间被解放军全部歼灭后，盘踞平遥之阎匪十九军军部，四十师师部及其二团全部、三团两个连，深恐被我歼灭，慌忙由平遥出发，分三路纵队沿同蒲路西侧向祁县方面逃窜。但当进入洪善车站西北七里地区时，即遭我解放军某部猛烈钳击，迅速楔入阎匪行列。阎匪行列大乱，扭头西逃。我即跟踪猛追，除前后两头之敌逃脱一小部外，敌之主力三千余人，全部被我压缩包围于北营村内。二十四日拂晓，我军对被包围之敌发起总攻，在猛烈的炮火掩护下，我突击队首先从村东南角突入村内。在临汾战役中立过大功，获得光荣称号之“赵世平班”突进村边时，发现敌人向北逃窜，他们即迅速向敌人冲去，一下就把敌人打得七零八散，俘敌连长以下百余人。某部新解放战士刘秦河，他的步枪打坏了，就用一个炸弹向一伙敌人堆里扔过去，当场炸死敌五名，伤十余名，跟着他又用缴获的步枪连发五枪，打死敌人六名。其余敌人纷纷叩头求饶，放下武器。
    村内敌人在我炮火轰击与突击队英勇冲杀下，死伤惨重，早已溃不成军。一股敌人向村西南突围逃跑，刚出村，又遭我预伏部队迎头痛击，只好又缩回村内。此时村内房屋已大部为我占领，一股敌人拥出村庄向西逃窜，我某部新解放战士赵玉珍，架起又短又粗的步重炮，瞄准逃跑的敌人连发七弹，弹弹落在混乱的敌人堆里，眼看着四五十个敌人横七竖八的倒在地上。我轻重机枪也于此时一齐开火，敌人跑得再快也跑不出我们的子弹的追击。数不清的敌人就在我军猛烈的火力下，为山西人民的吸血鬼阎锡山冤死在麦田里、大路上、地坎边。
    接着，我步兵突击队就紧紧追赶上去。惊慌的敌人完全失掉战斗力。我某部六班长牛龙喜在追击中，看见敌人拖着一门山炮。他的炸弹打完了，枪筒打热了，就临时捡起一块土圪＠向敌人投去。惊慌的敌人赶紧爬在地下不敢动。牛龙喜就这样缴了一门山炮。最后，侥幸未被我火力杀伤的阎匪，全部当了俘虏。约九时许，即全部解决了战斗。
