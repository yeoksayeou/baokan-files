Emergency Mobilization to Fight Drought and Prepare for Famine!

　　Ji-Lu-Yu Ninth Prefecture Committee
    Calls on Party Members and Village Cadres to Lead the Masses in Planting
    [Ji-Lu-Yu News] This summer has been dry with no rain. The Ji-Lu-Yu Ninth Prefecture Committee has issued instructions to all counties to urgently mobilize for drought resistance and planting. The instructions point out: The masses are very anxious about the drought, but have not taken emergency and effective remedial measures. If it does not rain again in ten days or half a month, this year's harvest will be greatly reduced, seriously affecting military and civilian food supplies. Therefore, the leadership must immediately lead the masses in planting. Counties and districts should immediately convene short meetings to mobilize branch party members, village cadres, and activists to lead the masses in planting in large quantities. We must respond to the call of the District Party Committee and the Administrative Office, and each person should try to plant half a mu of land. Men, women, old and young should be mobilized together to use manpower to overcome the drought. All personnel, livestock, and vehicles of various agencies should also be fully mobilized to help the villagers stationed in the villages with planting.

　　冀鲁豫九地委
    号召党员村干领导群众点种
    【冀鲁豫讯】今夏天旱不雨，冀鲁豫九地委特指示各县紧急动员抗旱点种。指示中指出：群众对干旱不雨非常着急，但尚未采取紧急有效的补救办法。再过十天半月不下雨，今年就要大大减少收成，严重影响军需民食。因此领导上要马上领导群众点种。县区应立即召集短促的会议，动员支部党员村干积极分子，带领群众大量点种。要响应区党委行署的号召，每人尽量点种到半亩地。男女老少应一齐动员用人力战胜天旱。各机关人员、牲口、车辆也要全部动员，帮助驻村群众点种。
