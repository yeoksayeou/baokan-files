　　Resolution of the Joint Conference of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Assemblies:
    Convene the North China Provisional People's Congress
    Discuss and Produce a Unified North China Democratic United Government, etc.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The vast liberated areas of North China have been completely linked together as the People's Liberation Army has drawn the war into the KMT-controlled areas. To adapt to this new situation and the demands of the people of North China, the resident councilors of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Areas Assemblies held a joint conference in Shijiazhuang on June 26th. The conference passed an important resolution to convene the North China Provisional People's Congress to produce a unified North China Democratic United Government. The details of the meeting are as follows:
    The meeting was jointly convened by Bo Yibo, Speaker of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly, and Cheng Fangwu, Speaker of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Assembly. It officially opened on June 26th at the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government Office. The councilors present included Bo Yibo, Cheng Fangwu, Xing Zhaotang, Yu Li, Chao Zhefu, Wang Naitang, Yan Lixuan, Yang Gengtian, Pei Yuming, An Zairen, Zhao Mingfu, Zhang Huayi, Liu Junde, and Guo Dongchen, totaling fourteen people. This exceeded two-thirds of the total number of resident councilors from both regions, meeting the legal quorum. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, and Song Shaowen, Chairman of the Administrative Committee of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region, were invited to attend. Cheng Fangwu, Speaker of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Assembly, was elected chairman of the meeting. In the harmonious atmosphere of the venue, Speaker Cheng announced the opening of the meeting and delivered a speech, stating: "Due to the development of the liberation war, the two major liberated areas of Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan have been completely integrated. The division caused by the Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek in the past no longer exists. In order to meet the political and economic demands of the people and further strengthen the various constructions in the North China Liberated Area, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's suggestion to merge the two major liberated areas in the north and south into the North China Liberated Area is timely and appropriate. The governments of the two regions should also be unified and merged into a unified government of North China. Therefore, the North China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China suggested that the resident organs of our two major liberated area assemblies discuss the appropriate steps for convening the North China Provisional People's Congress and establishing the North China United Government. After several discussions between Speaker Bo and myself, and joint research with Vice Speaker Xing, Vice Speaker Chao, and Vice Speaker Yu, it was decided to jointly convene a joint meeting of resident councilors from both regions to discuss the merger steps. I believe that the 45 million people of North China are looking forward to the rapid birth of a unified North China Democratic United Government, and today's meeting will be the starting point for realizing this requirement." After Speaker Cheng's speech, Mr. Xing Zhaotang, Vice Speaker of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly, stood up and spoke first. He said: "The merger of the two liberated areas and the merger of the two border region governments are very necessary. After the Japanese surrender, especially after our People's Liberation Army liberated Shijiazhuang, maintaining the artificial boundaries separated by the Zhengtai and Deshi Railways is unreasonable. This makes it extremely difficult for merchants and others to travel back and forth, and mutual blockades and taxation have reached an intolerable level. The proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is a measure that conforms to the will of heaven and responds to the people." He continued, "Now the two border region governments are already working together, but this can only be said to be a transitional step towards the complete merger of the two border region governments and the establishment of a formal North China government. We must realize the complete unified North China government that the people of North China are longing for. Therefore, I fully agree with and support the proposal of the North China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China to convene the North China Provisional People's Congress to produce the North China government." Then, Mr. Yu Li, Vice Speaker of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Assembly, spoke: "Convening the North China Provisional People's Congress to produce the North China government is in line with democratic principles, because these two major liberated areas have expanded even more since the Japanese surrender, doubling in size compared to the Anti-Japanese War period. The two border region assemblies were both produced during the Anti-Japanese War period, and they do not adequately represent the current 45 million people in the North China Liberated Area. At the same time, there have been significant personnel changes among the councilors over the years. Therefore, it is appropriate to convene a provisional people's congress. I propose that the preparatory work for the provisional people's congress should be handled by the two border region governments that are already working together." Councilor Liu Junde said: "In order to gather the strength of the people of North China and more powerfully support the front lines in order to win the victory of the People's Liberation War, it is very necessary to merge the two governments; the method of convening a provisional representative assembly to produce the North China United Government is also good." Councilor Guo Dongchen said: "The people have long hoped for unification. During the Anti-Japanese War, separation was a last resort. Now, in order to facilitate commerce and benefit the people and the exchange of materials, I fully agree with everyone's opinions." Councilor An Zairen said: "The democratic substance of the liberated areas has always existed, but the democratic form was very rudimentary in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. The election of the assembly was already much more complete. This decision to convene a provisional people's congress makes the democratic form even more complete. I think it is necessary and indispensable to build a new country." The elderly Councilor Yan Lixuan said: "The merger of the two regions is very important. The Communist Party proposed convening a political consultative conference to establish a national democratic united government, and we are the first to respond." Councilor Wang Naitang said: "I agree with the opinions of Mr. Xing and Mr. Yu. The unification of the two regional governments is not a requirement that only exists today; this need existed during the Anti-Japanese War. If the currency is not unified, the postal service is not unified, and materials cannot be exchanged, the people have long felt inconvenienced. However, this requirement is now even more urgent." Vice Speaker Chao Zhefu said: "The merger of the two regions and the establishment of a unified government meet the needs of the people; convening a provisional representative assembly is a more complete democratic form than convening the two regional assemblies." Councilor Yang Gengtian said: "When the provisional representative assembly is convened, the two regional governments should report to the assembly." Councilor Pei Yuming said: "I agree with everyone's opinions. The provisional representative assembly should be prepared and convened quickly; according to legal procedures, the government should be responsible for the preparatory work." After three hours of enthusiastic discussion, everyone's opinions were completely consistent. Finally, Speaker Bo Yibo stood up and said: "Today, all the councilors unanimously agree with the suggestion of the North China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China. I would like to thank everyone on behalf of the North China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China." Then he said: "The merger of the two liberated areas into the North China Liberated Area and the merger of the two border region governments into the North China government are necessary for the people's lives and are completely permitted by objective circumstances. The past division was forced and unavoidable. Today, there is no basis to continue this artificial division." He continued, "The North China Provisional People's Congress should be convened on the basis of an extremely broad anti-Chiang national united front. It should represent and unite all workers, peasants, independent laborers, intellectuals, the free bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, ethnic minorities, and all anti-American imperialist and anti-Chiang democratic forces in North China in order to produce the North China Democratic United Government." After he explained in detail the tasks and nature of the North China Provisional People's Congress and the future North China Democratic United Government, as well as the wishes of the Communist Party, he then highly praised the past work of the two regional assemblies. He said: "During the Anti-Japanese War, the ten major policies proposed by the Communist Party were successively adopted by the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area Assemblies. For example, Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei promulgated the Double Ten Program in 1940, and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan promulgated the Border Region Governance Program in 1941, as well as various policies and regulations such as rent reduction and interest reduction, streamlining troops and simplifying administration, developing production, and uniting people from all walks of life to resist Japan. All of these concentrated the opinions of the broad masses of the people, were proposed by our party, and were passed and adopted by the assembly, becoming the basis for the two liberated areas to persist in resisting Japan and defeat Japan, and also the basis for defeating Chiang's army's attacks and achieving continuous victories. The people of the two liberated areas are glorious, and the assemblies of the two liberated areas are also glorious." Speaker Bo finally emphasized: "For eleven years, our party's unchanging policy has been to closely unite people from all walks of life to jointly defeat the enemies of the people, and to advocate the general policy of a New Democratic New China. In the future, we will continue to implement this general policy, organize the strength of the 45 million people in North China, and implement the call of our party Central Committee and the people's leader Mao Zedong to improve industrial and agricultural production by an inch in order to more powerfully strive for the liberation of all of North China and even all of China." After Speaker Bo's speech, the entire venue was extremely excited. Finally, Chairman Cheng, as the speaker, summarized the discussion results into two resolutions and submitted them to everyone for voting: (1) Agree to merge the two liberated areas into the North China Liberated Area, and merge the two border region governments into the North China Government. The two border region governments that are already working together are a transitional form of government transitioning to a completely unified North China Government. (2) The two border region governments that have already joined forces will immediately prepare for and quickly convene the North China Provisional People's Congress in order to produce the North China Unified Democratic United Government. It was unanimously approved by all resident councilors. The meeting lasted three hours and closed in an atmosphere of unity, harmony, and joy.

　　晋冀鲁豫晋察冀边区参议会联席会议决议
    召开华北临时人民代表大会
    讨论产生统一的华北民主联合政府等问题
    【本报特讯】华北广大解放区，已因人民解放军把战争引向蒋管区，而完全联成一片。为适应此种新形势及华北人民的要求，晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两解放区参议会驻会参议员，于六月二十六日在石家庄举行联席会议。通过召开华北临时人民代表大会，产生统一的华北民主联合政府的重要决议。兹志会议经过如下：
    会议由晋冀鲁豫边区参议会薄议长一波、晋察冀边区参议会成议长仿吾，联名邀集。于六月二十六日假石家庄市府办公厅，正式开会。计到会参议员薄一波、成仿吾、邢肇棠、于力、晁哲甫、王乃堂、阎力宣、杨耕田、裴毓明、安宅仁、赵明甫、张化夷、刘俊德、郭栋臣等十四人，超过两边区驻会参议员全额三分之二，达到法定开会人数。会议并邀请晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席杨秀峰、晋察冀边区行政委员会主任委员宋劭文列席。公推晋察冀边区参议会议长成仿吾主席，成议长在会场和谐的气氛中，即席宣布开会，并致词，略称：“由于解放战争形势的发展，晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两大解放区已经完全联成一体，过去由日伪及蒋介石所造成的分割局面已不复存在。为适应人民政治经济上的要求，进一步加强华北解放区的各种建设，中共中央合并南北两大解放区为华北解放区的建议，切合时宜。两边区政府自亦应统一合并而为华北统一的政府。因而中共华北中央局又建议我两大解放区参议会驻会机关，商讨召开华北临时人民代表大会，成立华北联合政府的适当步骤。经薄议长与本人数度商讨，并与邢副议长、晁副议长、于副议长共同研究结果，乃确定联名召开两区驻会参议员联席会议，讨论合并的步骤。本人相信，华北四千五百万人民，正盼望着一个统一的华北民主联合政府的迅速诞生，今天这个会议将成为实现这个要求的起点。”成议长致词毕，晋冀鲁豫边区参议会副议长邢肇棠先生，首先起立发言，他说：“两解放区合并，两边区政府合并，十分必要。日本投降后，特别是我人民解放军解放石家庄后，仍然保持着为正太德石两路所隔开的人为界限，是不合理的，这使商民人等来往备受阻碍，相互封锁征税，已达到不能忍耐的程度，中共中央的提议是顺乎天而应乎人的举措。”继称：“现在两边区政府已经联合办公，但是这只能说是两边区政府完全合并，成立正式的华北政府的过渡步骤。必须实现华北人民所渴望的完全统一的华北政府。因此，我完全同意并拥护中共华北中央局召开华北临时人民代表大会产生华北政府的建议。”继由晋察冀边区参议会副议长于力先生发言：“召开华北临时人民代表大会以产生华北政府是适合民主原则的，因这两大解放区自日本投降后，地区更为扩大，较之抗战期间扩大两倍，而两边区参议会则均在抗战期间产生，代表现在华北解放区四千五百万人口，甚感不够。同时，多年来参议员人事变动亦很大。故以召开临时人民代表大会为宜。临时代表大会的筹备工作，我提议应由已经联合办公的两边区政府办理。”刘参议员俊德发言：“为了集合华北人民的力量，更有力的支援前线，以争取人民解放战争的胜利，两个政府合并很必要；召开临时代表大会产生华北联合政府的办法也是好的。”郭参议员栋臣说：“人民是早就希望统一的。在抗战时期，分开是不得已的。现在为了便商利民，交流物资，我完全同意大家的意见。”安参议员宅仁说：“解放区的民主实质从来就有，但民主形式在抗战初期，是很简陋的，到参议会的选举，就已经比较完备多了。这次决定召开临时人民代表大会，民主形式就更加完备。我认为建设一个新的国家，这是必要的，不可或缺的。”年高须白的阎参议员力宣说：“两区合并很重要。共产党提议召开政治协商会议，成立全国民主联合政府，我们就首先响应。”王参议员乃堂说：“同意邢、于两先生意见。两区政府的统一，不只今天，才有这个要求；抗日时期即有此需要。如货币不统一、邮政不统一、物资不能交流，人民早已感受不便。不过，现在这个要求更加迫切了。”晁副议长哲甫说：“两区合并，建立统一的政府，合乎人民需要；召开临时代表大会，比召开两区参议会的民主形式更完备些。”杨参议员耕田说：“临时代表大会召开时，两区政府应向大会作报告。”裴参议员毓明说：“同意大家意见。临时代表大会应迅速筹备召开；筹备工作按法定手续应由政府负责。”会议经过三小时的热烈讨论，大家意见完全一致。最后薄议长一波起立发言，他说：“今天全体参议员先生一致同意中共华北中央局的建议，我谨代表中共华北中央局向大家致谢。”接着又说：“两解放区合并为华北解放区，两边区政府合并为华北政府，是为人民生活所必须，且为客观情况所完全许可。过去分割是被迫的，不得已的，今天再把这种人为的分割继续下去，已没有任何根据。”他继说：“华北临时人民代表大会应该在极其广泛的反蒋民族统一战线的基础上召开，应该代表并团结全华北的工人、农民、独立劳动者、知识分子、自由资产阶级、开明绅士、少数民族及一切反美帝反蒋民主力量，以产生华北的民主联合政府。”在他详细地阐明了华北临时人民代表大会及将来产生的华北民主联合政府的任务、性质和共产党的愿望后，接着又对两区参议会过去的工作，作了很高的评价。他说：“在抗战期间，共产党所提出的十大政策，晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两解放区参议会均先后予以通过采纳，如晋察冀一九四○年颁布双十纲领，晋冀鲁豫一九四一年颁布边区施政纲领，以及各项政策法令，如减租减息、精兵简政、发展生产、团结各阶层人民抗战等等，都是集中了广大人民的意见，为我党所提出，为参议会所通过所采纳，成为两解放区坚持抗战，打败日本的依据，也是打败蒋军进攻，取得不断胜利的依据。两解放区人民是光荣的，两解放区参议会也是光荣的。”薄议长最后着重说明：“十一年来我党一条不变的方针，就是紧密团结各阶层人民共同击败人民的敌人，建议新民主主义新中国的总政策。今后仍然要贯彻这一条总政策，组织华北四千五百万人民的力量，执行我党中央和人民领袖毛泽东的号召，把工业农业生产提高一寸，以便更有力地为解放全华北以至全中国而奋斗。”薄议长发言后，全场均极兴奋。最后由主席成议长归纳讨论结果为两项决议，提请大家表决：（一）同意两解放区合并为华北解放区，两边区政府合并为华北政府。现在业已联合办公的两边区政府为过渡到完全统一的华北政府的过渡政府形式。（二）由业经联合办公的两边区政府立即筹备，并迅速召开华北临时人民代表大会，以便产生华北的统一的民主联合政府。当经全体驻会参议员一致通过。会议历时三小时于团结、和谐、愉快的空气中闭幕。
