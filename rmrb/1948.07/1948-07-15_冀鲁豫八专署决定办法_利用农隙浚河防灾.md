Jiluyu News: The Eighth Administrative Office of Jiluyu has decided to take advantage of the slack season between the completion of hoeing large seedlings and before the planting of small seedlings to intensify river dredging and prevent disasters. The region has rivers such as the Majia River, Wei River, Zhulong River, and Nei Xiao River, which have historically been prone to flooding. Last year, in order to expand the wheat planting area, river dredging and water diversion were carried out, but due to the vastness of the project, it could not be completed in the short term. Only [unclear code] had 1,000 hectares of land flooded and unable to be planted with wheat. This year, the masses unanimously requested to dredge and repair the rivers. The Construction Section of our Eighth Administrative Office specially convened a meeting of the construction sections of relevant counties to discuss and resolve: (1) This year's river dredging will basically still adopt the dredging method. Due to the limitation of manpower, materials, and time, it is not appropriate to engage in large-scale efforts. There is also no uniform regulation on when to start construction together or a deadline for completion. Instead, it should be combined with other work. Whichever place is ready first will start construction first, and it is best to seize the gap before the rainy season to complete it. (2) It is determined to first focus on the main streams, namely the Majia River and Zhulong River. As for the tributaries of each county, they can be tackled in the second step. (3) The distribution of the mainstream project is determined according to the size of the project in each county and the burden of strength. The area where the county borders with the county should be excavated first, to avoid the recurrence of the two counties relying on each other, failing to excavate properly, and thus causing disasters. (4) Food issue: The mainstream will be subsidized by the government. The tributaries will in principle be raised by the village itself. However, if the masses are truly in difficulty, the government can also subsidize a part. (5) Combine river dredging with other work. In villages where the masses urgently request river dredging, reduce or suspend unnecessary mass meetings during wheat requisition work in order to strive for an early start of construction.

　　冀鲁豫八专署决定办法
    利用农隙浚河防灾
    【冀鲁豫讯】八专署决定趁大苗已锄完、小苗尚未下种的空隙，加紧疏浚河道，以防灾患。该区共有马颊河、卫河、潴龙河、内硝河等河，历年常闹水灾。去年为扩大种麦面积，曾挖河疏水，但因工程浩大，短期无法完工。只××（电码不清）即有一千顷地被水淹没，未能种上麦子。今年群众一致要求浚修河流。我八专署建设科特召集有关各县建设科开会商讨，议决：（一）今年挖河基本上仍是采用浚修办法，由于人力物力及时间的限制，不宜轰轰烈烈大搞，在时间上也不统一规定一齐动工，或限期完成，而是结合其他工作，那里先准备好那里先动工，最好在雨季前抓紧空隙完成。（二）确定首先搞主流即马颊河和潴龙河。至于各县之支河可以第二步搞。（三）主流工程分配，根据各县工程大小，力量负担的轻重来确定。应先将县与县交界地方挖好，免蹈两县互相依赖，都挖不好，因而成灾的复辙。（四）粮食问题：主流由政府补助一部。支流原则上由村自筹。但群众真正困难者，政府也可补助一部。（五）挖河与其他工作结合，在群众迫切要求挖河的村庄，麦征工作中要少开或停开不必要的群众会，以便争取早日动工。
