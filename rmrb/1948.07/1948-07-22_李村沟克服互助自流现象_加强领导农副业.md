　　Li Chungou Overcomes Spontaneous Mutual Aid, Strengthens Leadership in Agriculture and Sideline Occupations
　　[Taihang News] Li Chungou in the Fifth District of Lucheng strengthens production leadership and overcomes the spontaneous phenomenon of mutual aid groups, going all out for agricultural and sideline production. This spring, the masses were not enthusiastic when reorganizing the mutual aid groups. Later, after a forced reorganization, a plan was drawn up to complete sowing by the fifth day of the fourth lunar month, but some group leaders still did not dare to lead boldly and actively. Spontaneous production occurred within the groups, with democracy being mistaken for doing whatever one wanted. As a result, sowing was not completed until the fifteenth day of the fourth month, delayed by ten days. At the mass production meeting on the sixth of this month to review spring plowing and sowing, Hao Facheng, chairman of the farmers' association, first reviewed the lack of leadership in production work, because cadres had not been democratic enough in the past, made many mistakes, and were now afraid of making mistakes and dared not lead. After group discussions, the reasons for the poor performance of the mutual aid groups were identified: First, there was a misunderstanding of democracy, with no leadership needed. For example, Hao Tianfu said: "This year's mutual aid group is spontaneous, and the land can be cultivated well!" He did not consider that there was no participation in the war this year, and the grain transport tasks. If there were these tasks, the spring plowing and sowing would not be completed. Second, in the past, mutual aid relied on administrative orders, divorced from the masses. During the "three搶 (qiang)" campaign last year, the higher authorities called for completing the autumn harvest and autumn plowing tasks in twenty days. Small groups challenged each other in competitions, harvesting crops at night, and wasting beans on the ground. Some even cut green crops, reducing yields, which affected the masses' willingness to engage in mutual aid. After a heated discussion, everyone agreed that: a lone bird cannot form a flock, and a lone tree cannot form a forest, only by organizing can the land be cultivated well. Liang Madou, the branch secretary, said: "Everyone mentioned that when organizing mutual aid groups last year, the cadres subjectively issued administrative orders, which caused losses to the masses during the three搶 campaign. These are all the mistakes of the cadres and should be self-examined." Then, using the accounting method, it was pointed out that since the village's liberation, twenty-eight livestock and twenty-five carts had been added, all of which were bought by saving labor and earning money from transportation after organizing. This account enlightened the masses to further realize that doing a good job in mutual aid is a good way to get rich. Then, the whole village made a plan to organize weeding, combined with transportation. A total of one hundred and fifty-five full, half, and auxiliary laborers were converted into labor force, only one hundred and thirty were needed to complete weeding, and the other twenty-five laborers drove twenty-five carts for transportation.

　　李村沟克服互助自流现象
  　加强领导农副业
    【太行讯】潞城五区李村沟加强生产领导，克服互助组自流现象，全力进行农副业生产。今春整顿互助组时，群众就不热心。以后勉强整顿了，订出计划要在阴历四月初五日全部完成下种，但有的组长仍不敢大胆积极去领导，组内自流生产，把民主当成想干啥就干啥，结果四月十五日才下完种，拖长时间十天。本月六号群众生产大会上检查春耕下种，农会主席郝发成，首先检讨生产工作缺乏领导，是因为干部过去不够民主，犯了好多错误，现在怕犯错误，不敢领导了。后分组酝酿，找出互助组搞不好的原因：第一是误解民主，不要领导，如郝天福说：“今年互助组自流，地可种好啦”！他没有想到今年没有参战，运粮任务，如有这些任务，就完成不了春耕下种。第二、过去互助行政命令，脱离了群众，去年三抢运动，上级号召二十天完成秋收秋耕任务，小组里挑战竞赛，黑夜收割庄稼，把豆粒都糟踏在地里；还有的割了青庄稼，收成减少，影响群众不愿互助。经过热烈的讨论，大家一致认为：孤鸟不成群，孤树不成林，只有组织起来才能把地种好。支部书记梁马斗说：“大家提的去年组织互助组时，干部主观行政命令，在三抢运动中使群众受了损失，这都是干部的错误，应作自我检查”。接着即用算帐方法，指出该村解放到现在，增加了二十八个牲口、大车二十五辆，都是组织起来省下工、搞运输赚了钱买下的。这笔帐启发群众进一步认识了搞好互助是发家致富的好办法。接着全村便订下计划，组织起来锄苗，并结合运输进行。男女全半劳力及辅助劳力共折合劳力一百五十五个，只用一百三十个就能完成锄苗，另二十五个劳力赶上二十五辆大车运输。
