　　【Taiyue News】 After Southern Shanxi implemented the policy of protecting industry and commerce and corrected the deviation of wrongly attacking industry and commerce, more than four thousand escaped merchants have returned to resume business. In Wenxi, Linjin, Jishan and other places in Southern Shanxi, wrongly criticized industrial and commercial businesses were refunded or compensated during the correction process, and a large number of merchants who had fled to the Jiang-controlled areas returned upon hearing the news. Since May, more than 650 people have returned from Wu Wang Ferry, and more than 3,400 people have returned from Bei Ma Miaoqian Ferry, most of whom are from Ronghe and Linjin counties. According to salt merchants who returned to Yuncheng, they could not do any business in the Jiang-controlled areas, and the capital they brought out from home had been used up. Just as they were at their wit's end, they heard the news that the democratic government was implementing a policy of protecting industry and commerce, and they hurried back. Indeed, the Yuncheng democratic government not only issued a proclamation to protect industry and commerce, but also provided a large number of loans to support the development of industry and commerce. It loaned more than 80 million yuan in the salt industry alone, and also loaned some cotton and grain. Industry and commerce in Yuncheng, Wenxi and other places have begun to become active.

　　我保护工商业政策影响下
    晋南四千商人返回复业
    【太岳讯】晋南执行保护工商业政策，纠正错斗工商业的偏向后，逃亡的商人已有四千余人返回复业。晋南闻喜、临晋、稷山等地方，在纠偏中对过去误斗的工商业退还或作了赔偿，逃亡蒋管区的商人闻讯大批返回。五月以来，从吴王渡返回的有六百五十余人，从北马庙前渡回来的有三千四百多人，其中以荣河临晋两县为最多。据返回运城市的盐商谈：在蒋管区什么买卖都不能作，从家里带出去的老本已经吃光，正在走头无路的时候，听到了民主政府执行保护工商业政策的消息，他们就赶紧返回来了。的确，运城市民主政府不仅布告保护工商业，同时又大量贷款扶植工商业发展，仅在盐业上即贷款八万万余元，还贷了一部棉花与粮食。运城、闻喜等地工商业开始活跃起来。
