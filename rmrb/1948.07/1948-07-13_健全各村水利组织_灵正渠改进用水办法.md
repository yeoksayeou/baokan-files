　　Strengthen Village-Level Water Conservancy Organizations
    Lingzheng Canal Improves Water Usage Methods

    [Our Dispatch] The Ling (Shou) Zheng (Ding) Canal Water Conservancy Committee has guided the masses in improving the water release system, overcoming waste, and enabling the universal irrigation of 600 hectares of land. The canal stretches from west of Niucheng Village in Lingshou County to the vicinity of Kou Village and Fengjia Village in Zhengding County, with a total length of 86 li including branch canals. In the past, village-level water conservancy organizations were not established and strengthened, making it impossible to implement water agreements, resulting in significant waste and frequent disputes. For example, whoever needed to irrigate would open the sluice gate; if those downstream were irrigating, those upstream would block the water supply when they wanted to irrigate, and some would even neglect to close the gate after irrigating, causing water overflow, which not only wasted water but also flooded land. The branch canals were eroded with holes everywhere. The third branch canal irrigated for more than 20 days, with some at the headwaters irrigated several times, while Sankou Village, the farthest from the canal entrance, was never irrigated. Currently, due to prolonged drought and no rain, the river water level has dropped, with the canal water depth only 6 *cun* (approximately 20 cm). If it is not used rationally, much of the irrigated land will turn into dry land. To correct the above deviations and ensure that all 600 hectares of land are irrigated, the Canal Water Conservancy Committee decided to reorganize village-level water conservancy organizations, increase water sources and reduce water consumption to combat the drought. After investigation and measurement, it organized the masses to dig a 1,000-meter canal westward along the Hutuo River to divert the discharge water from the Shuinian Tan of Pingshan and the Yongsheng Canal into the canal. Special personnel were assigned to patrol the canal entrance and the river dam, repairing any damage immediately. In addition, capable cadres were sent deep into the villages to specifically assist the masses in establishing and strengthening village water conservancy committees and dividing water usage groups, mobilizing the masses to irrigate the land in a planned and organized manner on a rotational basis. After the water conservancy organization in Qiantta Village was strengthened, the masses formulated water usage discipline: the land farthest from the canal entrance should be irrigated first, and then gradually rotate upwards, with those upstream not allowed to arbitrarily block the water of others. Irrigation households were grouped by section, and groups took turns inspecting the canals and blocking breaches. With the improvement of the water usage system, the irrigated area increased significantly. In the past, the village irrigated less than 700 *mu* of land in several water releases. This time, within three days, all 2,000 *mu* of land within Lingshou County were completely irrigated. Party members in Gaoping Village held their own meetings before water release to discuss leading the masses in irrigating the land, resolving to influence others through their exemplary role in abiding by water usage agreements. After reorganization, the 13 villages of the Third Branch Canal saved a lot of labor and irrigated the land quickly and well. Only Donghe and Gangtou villages still have some waste. The × organ stationed in ×× Village does not respect the water usage agreement of the masses, and the entire irrigation plan has also been affected to some extent, which should be immediately inspected and corrected.

　　健全各村水利组织
    灵正渠改进用水办法
    【本报讯】灵（寿）正（定）渠水利委员会，领导群众改进放水制度，克服了浪费现象，使六百顷土地得到普遍灌溉。该渠西起灵寿牛城村西，东南至正定叩村、丰家庄一带，支渠干渠全长八十六里，包括二十七个受益村庄。过去各村水利组织没有建立与健全起来，使水公约无法贯彻，浪费现象很多，常常引起纠纷：如谁浇地谁开闸，下水正浇着，上水想浇就把水卡住，甚至浇后不关闸，任水溢流，既浪费水，又淹了地。支渠被涮的到处是洞。三支渠浇水二十多天，上水头有的浇过几遍，距渠口最远的三叩村始终没有浇着。目前久旱未雨，河水下落，渠水深度仅有六公寸，如不能合理使用，许多水地势将变成旱田。该渠水利委员会为纠正以上偏向，保证六百顷土地全部得到灌溉，决定整理村级水利组织，开源节流，以抗旱灾。经调查测量后，即组织群众循滹沱河向西挑渠一千米，把平山水碾滩和永胜渠的泄闸水导入该渠。设立专人巡视渠口及揽河坝，发现损毁随时抢修。另派得力干部深入到村，具体帮助群众建立与健全村水利委员会，划分使水小组，动员群众有计划有组织的轮流浇地。前塔村水利组织健全后，群众规定了使水纪律：让距渠口最远的地先浇，逐渐向上轮流，上水头不得随便卡别人的水。浇户按片分组，组与组拨工巡视渠道，堵塞决口。使水制度改善了，浇地面积大增。过去该村放水数次，浇地不足七百亩，这次三天时间，灵寿境内两千亩地即已全部浇完。高平村党员在放水前自行集会，讨论领导群众浇地，决以自己遵守使水公约的模范作用来影响别人。第三支渠十三个村经过组织后，人工节省很多，地浇的又快又好。仅东合、岗头两村尚有若干浪费现象。驻扎于××村的×机关不尊重群众使水公约，整个浇地计划也受了些影响，应该立即检查纠正。
