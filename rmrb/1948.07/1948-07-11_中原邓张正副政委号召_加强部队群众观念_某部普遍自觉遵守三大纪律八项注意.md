Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, July 9th: Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar of the Central Plains Military Region, and Zhang Jichun, Deputy Political Commissar, have repeatedly called on the troops to conscientiously implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention to strengthen the mass perspective of the troops. Political Commissar Deng recently emphasized at a meeting of cadres of a certain column: This is a matter of implementing the Party's line and policies. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention are what everyone in the entire army can and must do in order to implement the Party's line and policies. These were stipulated by Chairman Mao at the very beginning of the establishment of the People's Liberation Army; they are the basic conditions for being a revolutionary soldier. Chairman Mao concentrated the three major tasks of the people's army into the Three Main Rules of Discipline. He concentrated fighting into obeying all commands. He concentrated on doing mass work into not taking a single needle or thread from the masses. He concentrated fundraising into turning in all spoils. The Eight Points for Attention are the concretization of our policies and tasks. For example, speaking politely and not beating or scolding people is to oppose warlordism. Fair trade is to protect the policy of industry and commerce. Not mistreating prisoners and not searching prisoners' pockets are the prisoner policy. Therefore, we must not think that this is just a simple regulation from the superiors. Political Commissar Deng then called on the company soldiers' committees to have someone specifically responsible for supervising and inspecting the implementation of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. He said, "If this is done well, our army's strength will be infinite." He gave an example: "There was an area in Dabie Mountain ruled by local tyrants, which had long opposed us for 20 years. This time, when we first went there, all the people ran away. But our discipline was very good, and we didn't touch any of the people's things, and we cleaned up the station very well. The second time we went, the people didn't run away. They said, 'If we had known you were so good, why would we have run away?'"

At the political work conference of the Central Plains Field Army, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang Jichun emphatically criticized the phenomenon of some troops violating the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. He pointed out that the main reasons are: leaders at all levels have not provided sufficient and serious education and inspection, and have not mobilized the vast numbers of cadres and soldiers to jointly supervise; a few responsible cadres have even adopted a laissez-faire attitude of indifference and abandonment of leadership. He said, "If we want to resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's policy of winning over the masses in the new areas, we must strictly implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Otherwise, all so-called mass work is empty talk."

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, July 9th: In a certain unit of the Central Plains Field Army, the mass perspective has been generally improved during the troop consolidation, and they have consciously abided by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. According to the statistics of the Second Battalion of a certain unit in May, they helped the people carry more than 17,000 loads of water, plowed, hoed, and watered a total of 184 mu of land, and did many other odd jobs. The First Company of the unit held 21 mass meetings in one month to publicize the People's Liberation Army's propositions and policies. The soldiers' committee of another company saw that the company did not pay much attention to discipline towards the masses. After discussion and research, it immediately called on everyone to carry forward the glorious tradition and hard-working style of the People's Army and do a good job in the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. During marches, they tried their best to mobilize fewer livestock and vehicles to reduce the burden on the masses; whenever they arrived at a place, they immediately carried out the movement to fill the water tanks and fill the landlords' water tanks. The soldiers' committee conducted daily inspections and summaries, and recorded and commended the good squads and individuals. As a result, the company's mass discipline was continuously improved.

　　中原邓张正副政委号召
    加强部队群众观念
    某部普遍自觉遵守三大纪律八项注意
    【新华社中原前线九日电】中原军区政委邓小平、副政委张际春最近一再号召部队，好好实行三大纪律、八项注意，加强部队群众观念。邓政委近在某纵队干部会上，强调指出：这是贯彻党的路线和政策的问题。党的路线和政策，在全军中人人能办到和必需办到的就是三大纪律、八项注意。这是毛主席开始建立人民解放军就规定下来的；是做一个革命军人的起码条件。毛主席把人民军队的三大任务集中为三大纪律。把打仗，集中为一切行动听指挥。把做群众工作，集中为不拿群众一针一线。把筹款，集中为一切缴获交公。八项注意，则是我们的政策和任务的具体化。如说话和气，不打人骂人，是反对军阀主义。买卖公平，是保护工商业政策。不虐待俘虏，不搜俘虏腰包，是俘虏政策。因此，不能以为这是上级的简单规定。接着邓政委号召连队士兵委员会要有专人来负责督促和检查三大纪律和八项注意的执行，他说：“这件事办好了，我们军队的力量就是无穷的。”他举了一个例子说：“大别山有个土顽统治的地区，廿年来长期反对我们，这回我们第一次去，老百姓都跑光了。但是我们的纪律很好，老百姓的东西一点也没动，又把驻地打扫得干干净净。第二次我们去，老百姓就不跑了。他们说：‘早知道你们这样好，我们还跑什么？’”
    张副政委在中原野战军政工会议上，着重批评了某些部队违犯三大纪律、八项注意的现象。他指出主要原因是：各级领导上没有足够认真的教育和检查，没有发动广大干部和战士起来共同监督；少数负责干部，甚至采取漠不关心的放弃领导的自由主义态度。他说：“我们要坚决执行党中央争取新区群众的政策，就要严格执行三大纪律、八项注意。不然一切所谓群众工作都是空话。”
    【新华社中原前线九日电】中原野战军某部，在整军中，群众观念普遍提高，做到自觉遵守三大纪律八项注意。某部二大队五月份的统计，即帮助人民担水一万七千多担，犁地、锄地、浇地共一百八十四亩及其他许多零活。该部一中队一个月内召开了二十一次群众会，宣传解放军的主张和政策。另部某连士兵委员会看到该连对群众纪律不大注意，经讨论研究后立即号召大家发扬人民军队的光荣传统和艰苦作风，做好三大纪律八项注意。在行军中尽量作到少动员牲口和车辆，减轻群众负担；每到一地即进行满缸运动、替房东担满水缸。士兵委员会每天进行检查总结，对好的班排和个人记功表扬。该连的群众纪律因而不断改进。
