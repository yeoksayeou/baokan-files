Remembering the Battle of Baoji

The first liberation of Baoji City, a vital military and industrial city in the Northwest, by the Northwest People's Liberation Army, once again proved the futility of Hu Zongnan's fortified cities on the Northwest battlefield.

The towering Panlong Mountain to the east of the city was the enemy's solid protective position for defending Baoji. Forts were built on the mountain, surrounded by outer trenches and barbed wire. On the afternoon of April 25th, our battle to capture the forts began. The blasting operation successfully completed its task. With a loud bang, the fort gate was blown open. Fifteen minutes later, our army annihilated the enemy defenders of the fort, completely controlled Panlong Mountain, and continued to advance towards Dongguan.

Another unit of our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy's position at Jintai Pass in the northeast of the city. After a sharpshooter destroyed several of the enemy's main bunkers with four shots, the soldiers crawled through two layers of barbed wire and crossed trenches one foot deep and one foot wide to attack the enemy. One squad of the defending enemy immediately laid down their weapons. Another unit of our army rushed up from the left and right sides. Liberated soldier Li Xinyun jumped into an enemy-occupied courtyard alone and shouted, "Don't be afraid, we used to be from the 61st Brigade, we were liberated in the Yichuan battle. The Liberation Army treats us very well. As long as you lay down your weapons, you will definitely not be killed." After his shout, all the enemy defenders in the courtyard stopped resisting and laid down their weapons.

The enemy built three lines of fortifications and more than forty large and small bunkers on the mountain behind the airport, guarded by a battalion. Our army took them all with three companies and advanced towards the county seat.

In the west of the city, a unit of our army moved along both sides of the railway and entered Xiguan. In less than an hour, they advanced to the bridgehead, more than ten meters from the city. The bridge was broken and impassable. Guo Richeng, the deputy platoon leader of a certain unit, examined the terrain three times and led a squad to jump down from the ten-foot-high bridgehead, using the dead angle under the city to move towards the corner of the city wall. The city wall was lower here and made of earth, so they quickly dug steps to climb the city wall, immediately killing two enemies. The remaining enemies, under the sudden attack of our brave warriors, laid down their weapons. The warriors went down the city and opened the city gate, and our follow-up troops surged in, advancing along the street and pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy.

By the afternoon of the 26th, all the enemy defenders in Baoji City were wiped out; only an armored train east of the station was still stubbornly resisting. Xu Bao, the commander of the enemy's 76th Division who was defending Baoji, was holed up in the armored train with a special service company, waiting for "reinforcements." When our artillery shells continuously penetrated and exploded inside the train, the enemy tried to drive east to escape, but the rails in front had already been removed. Taking advantage of the gaps in the artillery bombardment, our brave warriors quickly climbed onto the roof of the train to blow up the carriages. The enemies inside the train hurriedly squeezed out to surrender their guns. Xu Bao was hit by a machine gun bullet inside the train and shouted, "How powerful!" Then he lay down on the bed and died of serious injuries. Thus, the Battle of Baoji came to a victorious conclusion.

　　追记宝鸡之战
    西北人民解放军对西北军事要地与工业城市宝鸡城的第一次解放战，在西北战场上又一次证明胡宗南设防城市之无用。
    高耸城东的盘龙山是敌人保卫宝鸡的险固护城阵地，山上修有寨子，周围有外壕与铁丝网围护。四月二十五日下午，我攻夺寨子的战斗开始。爆破作业首先胜利地完成了任务，一声巨响，寨门被炸开了。十五分钟以后，我军就消灭了寨子的守敌，全部控制了盘龙山，继续向东关进逼。
    另部我军向城东北金台关敌阵地展开猛攻，神炮手四发四中打垮了敌人几个主要地堡后，战士们便钻过两层铁丝网，越过深宽各一丈的壕堑向敌进攻。守敌中有一个班立即放下武器。我军另部由左右两侧冲上去。解放战士李新云单身跳进敌占院内喊话：“你们不要怕，我们原来是六十一旅的，宜川战斗才解放的，解放军对咱们很好，只要放下武器，绝对不杀。”经他一喊，院内守敌便全部停止抵抗，放下武器。
    飞机场后山上敌人筑了三道工事和四十多个大小碉堡，由一个营守卫。我军以三个连兵力即将其全部拿下，并向县城进攻。
    城西我军一部沿铁路两旁运动进入西关，不到一小时，即进至城下十余米达的桥头。该桥已断，不能通过。某部排副郭日成看了三次地形，便率领一个班跳下丈余高的桥头，利用城下死角地带向城墙拐角处运动。该处城墙较低，且系土质，因此很快挖了台阶登上城墙，立即打死两个敌人，其余敌人在我勇士突然猛击下均放下武器。勇士们下城打开城门，我后续部队乃锋拥而进，沿街进展，追歼溃敌。
    二十六日下午，宝鸡城内守敌全被肃清；只有车站东面的一辆铁甲车还在顽抗。这里面就是防守宝鸡的敌七十六师师长徐保，他带着一个特务连龟缩在铁甲车内，困守待“援”。当我军炮弹连续穿入车厢内爆炸时，敌人想开车东逃，但前面的铁轨早已搬掉了。我军勇士们乘炮弹轰击的间隙，迅速爬上车顶进行爆破车厢，车内敌人连忙挤出来缴枪投降。徐保在车内中了机枪弹，叫了一声“好厉害！”以后，便卧倒床上，伤重毙命。至此宝鸡之战遂胜利结束。
