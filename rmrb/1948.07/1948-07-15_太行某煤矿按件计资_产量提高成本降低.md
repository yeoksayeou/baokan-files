Taihang News: In recent months, all state-owned factories in Taihang have been striving to improve various policies in response to the call from the Central Bureau to increase production by even an inch. First and foremost, they are improving factory management and operations, and rectifying labor and wage policies. The outlook of all state-owned factories has undergone a transformation. To commemorate "July 1st," all employees of a certain state-owned coal mine company in Taihang enthusiastically launched a production increase campaign. The slogan was put forward after the mine implemented a piece-rate wage system with the principle of "more work, more pay" on June 1st. The workers' enthusiasm and creativity have been universally enhanced, and output has generally increased. The implementation of the new standard in the ×× well yielded significant results within the first three days. The total output of coal miners increased by 14.2% above the standard output from the first day to the third day. Some even exceeded the standard output by 100%, creating the highest coal mining record since the company was founded. The new wage standard stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of Chen Chengli, a miner from Well No. 12. He exceeded the standard output, and his wage increased to 17.5 jin of millet per shift (previously, the fixed wage was 16 jin and 10 liang). He said, "In the past, the evaluation was unfair. It didn't matter how much you mined, it was always the same amount. The current method is very good." The car worker Wang Lin pulled 7 tons of coal in one shift, ranking first in the entire field. In one field, Yang Shungui, Pei Jizhi, Yang Jucai, and other four miners all exceeded the standard output by 50% to 70% due to their correct work attitude and careful study of technology. Pei Jizhi was originally a carpenter, but he was transferred to coal mining due to work needs. Initially, he could only reach 70% of the standard output, but he did not lose heart. He was determined to study and improve his skills. Now, he has increased his daily production to 114% of the standard output, and it has even reached 168% at the highest. Inspired by the new wage policy, the workers in various departments of the power plant also completed their tasks ahead of schedule and strived to save raw materials. The mechanical workers manufactured a certain machine part, which originally required 167 work hours, but now only requires 137. The First Branch Plant repaired Machine No. 1, promoting democracy, and held discussions in advance, removing the past problem of simply pursuing speed but not repairing it well, which prevented the work from being completed smoothly and on time. As a result, from dismantling and hoisting to repairing and installing, it was completed four days ahead of schedule. The boiler department's firemen tried everything possible to save raw materials and reduce costs. After work every day, comrades like Wang Laishan went to the Engineering Section to inquire about their own and others' coal consumption and power generation, and recorded it in their notebooks, checking their own savings achievements day by day. The workers launched a competition to save raw materials and created many methods. For example, when coal dust leaked into the furnace, it would run out of the chimney before it could burn, resulting in high coal consumption and low power generation. Later, they developed a method of sprinkling water before burning, which not only saved coal but also maintained the pressure at 90 to 100 degrees. The improvement of firing technology greatly saved raw materials. The coal ash that was dug out has changed from gray to white, and there are very few coal slags. After education, the stonemasons have generally changed their old habit of "dragging their feet" and launched a production increase campaign to improve work efficiency and strive to exceed the standard. Within 20 days, the average output of stonemasons has increased from two square feet to four square feet, and 14 production models such as Wang Huaide have emerged.

　　太行某煤矿按件计资
    产量提高成本降低
    【太行讯】数月来，太行各公营工厂，为响应中央局所提把生产提高一寸的号召，努力端正各种政策，首先改善工厂管理经营方法，端正工运工资政策，各公营工厂面貌，均为之改观。公营某煤矿公司全体职工为纪念“七一”，热烈展开增产竞赛运动。该矿自六月一日实行了按件计资、多劳多得的工资标准后，即提出这个口号。工人生产积极性与创造性普遍提高，产量普遍增加。××井在实行新标准的头三天，即收到很大效果。挖煤工人总产量从第一天到第三天，提高标准产量百分之十四点二，有的甚至已超过标准产量的一倍，创造了公司开办以来挖煤的最高纪录。新工资标准启发了十二号井矿工陈成礼的积极性和创造性，他超过了标准产量，工资增加到每班十七斤半小米（过去固定工资十六斤十两）。他说：“过去评分不公，不管挖多挖少都是那么多，现在的办法很好”。车工王林作到一班拉煤七吨，为全场第一。一场杨双贵、裴计只、杨聚财等四个矿工，由于劳动态度正确，细心研究技术，均超过标准产量百分之五十至七十。裴计只原是个木工，后因工作需要调他挖煤，开始只能达到标准数的百分之七十，但他不灰心，决心研究改进技术，现在已提高到每天生产标准产量百分之一百一十四，最高时曾达到百分之一百六十八。发电厂各部工人也在新工资政策鼓舞下，提前完成任务，并努力节省原料。机务工人制造某种机器零件，原需一百六十七个工，现只用一百三十七个。一分厂修理一号机器，发扬了民主，事先作了讨论，去掉了过去单纯图快而修不好，使工作不能顺利按时完成的毛病。结果从拆吊到修理按装，提前四天完成。锅炉部烧火工人想尽一切方法节省原料，减低成本。王来善等同志每天下班后就到工务股打听自己和别人的烧煤数与发电量，并把他记到本子上，逐日检查自己的节约成绩。工人们为了节省原料展开竞赛，创造了许多办法，如煤面漏入炉内，来不及燃烧便从烟筒跑了，烧的多而发电量少，后来便研究出先洒上水再烧，不但节省煤，而且保持气压经常在九十度至一百度。烧火技术的改进大大节省了原料，挖出的煤灰已由过去的灰色变成白色，炭渣也就很少见到了。石工经过教育后，已普遍改变了过去“磨洋工”的旧习气，展开了提高工作效率，为超过标准而努力的增产运动，在二十天内，琢石料工人平均已由二方尺增至四方尺，涌现出王怀德等十四位生产模范。
