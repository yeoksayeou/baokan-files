　　Jinzhong: Our Army Approaches Taiyuan!
    (For mass blackboards and rooftop broadcasts)
    The Central Shanxi People's Liberation Army wins battle after battle, smashing Yan Xishan's army to pieces. They are either dead, wounded, or captured alive in large numbers. Yan Xishan sees that his end is near.
    Originally, Yan Xishan had five army headquarters, fifteen divisions, and three general detachments. In the past month or so, our People's Liberation Army has almost completely annihilated them. Including one division far away in Datong, only three divisions and one general detachment remain. Yan's bandit Seventh Army Group Commander Zhao Chengshou and Thirty-third Army Commander Shen Rui were also captured by us on the 16th.
    Yan Xishan originally occupied fifteen county towns. Now, including Taiyuan, only the four cities of Taiyuan City, Taiyuan County, Xinxian, and Yuci remain. These four county towns are also surrounded by our People's Liberation Army. The day when Yan Xishan will be completely eliminated is not far away.

　　晋中我军逼近太原！
    （供大众黑板及屋顶广播用）
    山西中部解放军，仗仗胜利，把阎锡山的军队打得稀巴烂，死的死，伤的伤，活捉的更是不少。阎锡山眼看快完蛋了。
    原来阎锡山共有五个军部和十五个师三个总队人马，一个多月以来，被咱解放军歼灭得已经快差不多，连同远在大同的一个师在内，现在剩下的只有三个师和一个总队了。阎匪第七集团军总司令赵承绶和三十三军军长沈瑞也于十六日被咱捉住了。
    阎锡山原来占领十五个县城，现在连太原算进去，只剩下太原市、太原县、忻县、榆次四个城了。这四个县城，也都被咱解放军团团包围住，阎锡山被最后消灭的日子已不远了。
