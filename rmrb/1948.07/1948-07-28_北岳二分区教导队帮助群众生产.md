　　North Yue Second Sub-district Training Corps Helps the Masses with Production
　　[North Yue News] The North Yue Second Sub-district Training Corps vigorously helped the local masses with production, greatly strengthening the relationship between the army and the people. Trainee Cai Fucheng would automatically chop firewood, make fires, empty the stove ashes, carry water, and move furniture for the masses during his spare time, just like a member of their own family. After completing construction work each time, Pan Liuxiao from the Fourth Squad always carried elm bark he had dug up back for his landlord, or brought back some firewood to give to the landlord, rarely returning empty-handed. Jia Laohu from the Sixth Squad always took it upon himself to fetch water for his landlord, no matter where he lived; Shi Fuzhong from the Eighth Squad, who used to be a carpenter, helped the masses repair houses and frequently carried manure. When the villagers joined the army, they helped the masses hoe yams and corn, solving the difficulties of the militiamen's families who were going to war, and eliminating their worries about going to war. They hoed 100 mu of seedlings, weeded 29 mu of wheat, plowed 9 mu of land, sowed 7 mu of seeds, and carried water, soil, and manure a total of 2,351 loads for the masses. In addition, they helped the masses with tasks such as pushing the millstone, grinding flour, chopping grass, turning manure, planting melons, and chopping firewood, totaling the equivalent of 265 man-days. Several old landlady in Chengwu Village felt that the comrades were too good to them, so they automatically mended clothes and shoes for the trainees. An emancipated old peasant in Chaizhuang fried a pot of beans and sent them to the comrades, saying, "I really feel bad. I don't have anything else, so everyone can eat some beans!" Some brought water, cooked dry rations, and some even wanted them to stay for meals, while others bought them cigarettes.

　　北岳二分区教导队帮助群众生产
    【北岳讯】北岳二分区教导队大力帮助驻地群众生产，大大密切了军民关系。学员蔡福成一到课余时间，便自动给群众劈柴、生火、掏炉灰、担水、搬家具，就象群众自己家里人一样。四班潘六小每次做完工事回家，总是把刨出的榆树皮给房东背回来，或者另弄些柴火送给房东，很少空回来。六班的贾老虎不论到哪里住，房东的吃水总是他一人包揽；八班史福忠过去是木匠，他帮助群众修房子，并经常担大粪。驻村群众参战时，他们帮助群众锄山药，锄玉茭，解决了出征民兵家中困难，消除了他们出征的顾虑。他们共给群众锄苗一百亩，拔麦二十九亩，刨地九亩，下种七亩，挑水、担土、送粪共二千三百五十一担。此外帮群众推碾、推磨、铡草、翻粪、种瓜、劈柴等，总共折合人工二百六十五个。城武村几个房东老太太，觉得同志们对他们太好了，便自动给学员们补衣服、鞋子；柴庄的一个翻身老农民炒了一锅豆子送给同志们说：“我实在过意不去。别的没有，大伙吃点豆子吧！”有的送水、烧干粮，还有的要留着吃饭，有的给买纸烟。
