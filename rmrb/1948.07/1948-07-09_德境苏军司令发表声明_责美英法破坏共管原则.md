Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: TASS reports: The Information Bureau of the Soviet Military Government in Germany issued a statement on the 2nd from the Soviet Commander in Berlin to the US, British, and French Commanders, condemning the latter for being responsible for undermining the work of the Berlin Allied Command. The original statement reads as follows: "The Soviet Chief of Staff of the Allied Staff believes it is no longer possible to attend the Allied Staff meetings. This is because since Colonel Howley, the US Commander, refused to discuss the Soviet proposal to improve the material treatment and legal status of workers and staff in Berlin's industry and transportation at the Commander's meeting on June 16, and made some insulting remarks to the Allied Command and left the meeting, the Berlin Allied Command has effectively ceased operations. This rude behavior by the US Commander undermined the work of the Berlin Allied Command. Importantly, the US Command did not respond to the Soviet protest against Howley's unreasonable actions. Subsequently, the US, British, and French Commanders in Berlin, disregarding the fact that Berlin is located within the Soviet occupation zone and is an economically integral part of the Soviet occupation zone, issued a joint illegal order in the Western occupation zones of Berlin, circulating new currency from the Western occupation zones in Berlin marked with the letter "B". The purpose of these actions is to undermine the currency circulation and disrupt the economy of the Soviet occupation zone and Greater Berlin. This is incompatible with the principle of four-power joint control of Berlin."

　　德境苏军司令发表声明
    责美英法破坏共管原则
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社报导：德境苏联军政府新闻局于二日发表柏林苏军司令致美英法三方司令的声明，谴责后者应负破坏柏林盟军司令部工作之责。声明原文如下：“盟军参谋部苏方参谋长认为不可能再出席盟军参谋部会议。因为自从美军司令霍利上校，在六月十六日司令会议上，拒绝讨论苏方所提出的改善柏林工业与运输业中工人与职员的物质待遇与法律地位的建议，并对盟军司令部作若干侮辱的言词而退出会议以后，柏林盟军司令部实际上停止活动。美军司令这种无礼的行为，破坏了柏林盟军司令部的工作。重要的是：美方司令部对苏方抗议霍利这种不合理的行动置而不答。随后，柏林美英法三方司令，又不顾柏林是处于苏占区内与为苏占区经济上组成部分这一事实，在柏林西方占领区颁发三方共同的非法命令，在柏林流通加有“Ｂ”字印记的西方占领区新币。这些行动的目的，在于瓦解苏占区与大柏林的货币流通并破坏其经济。这是与柏林的四国共管原则不相容的。”
