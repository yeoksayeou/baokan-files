　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 26th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Jinzhong Front, due to the occasional violations of discipline that still occurred during operations in the new areas, conducted discussions on a squad basis. The unit's leading organs centralized everyone's opinions and formulated three measures for observing policies and discipline: (1) Launching disciplinary mutual assistance with mutual supervision and mutual help. (2) Establishing a disciplinary duty officer system in each squad. Under the leadership of the squad leader, the duty officer will check the discipline of the squad at any time and anywhere to ensure the implementation of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. (3) The duty officer should check whether the duties have been completed when handing over shifts. At the same time, the unit's leading organs also decided that under the unified leadership of the Civil Affairs Committee of each company's Party branch, two civil affairs group members should be set up in each platoon to be responsible for propaganda, investigation, and inspection of the implementation of policies and disciplines in the entire platoon, and to be responsible for the leadership of the disciplinary duty officers of each squad. The entire company will also strictly implement a personal belongings registration system to prevent violations of discipline such as corruption, searching prisoners' pockets, and taking the people's belongings privately.
