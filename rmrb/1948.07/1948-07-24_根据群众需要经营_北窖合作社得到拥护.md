Beiyue News: The Beijiao Village Cooperative in Liangxiang was organized in March of last year with a share capital of one million yuan (border currency). It sold oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, paper, soap, grain, and other items, only able to supply the masses with some daily necessities. After the autumn of last year, due to the enemy's blockade, a large number of walnuts and apricot kernels in the village could not be sold, and the autumn harvest was poor, making life very difficult for the masses. The cooperative then changed its business policy, buying a large quantity of walnuts and apricot kernels to extract oil. Many women participated in labor such as cracking kernels and grinding. The masses' accumulated 30 shi (one dou is 20 jin) of apricot kernels and 200,000 walnuts were sold. Selling oil externally earned a transportation fee of 1.42 million yuan, and women earned wages of 5.42 million yuan. The masses' living difficulties were solved, and the cooperative also earned more than 8 million yuan. In winter, the cooperative organized more than 60 women to carry out spinning, receiving one jin of cotton to deliver half a jin of yarn (earnings could be exchanged for grain). A total of 300 jin of yarn was spun in winter, solving the living problems of many people and also supplying some cloth to the village. This spring, the masses were very short of grain. The cooperative bought 5,000 jin of grain from Zhangfang and organized the masses to transport grain, earning transportation fees. Two iron furnaces were organized to make farm tools, and the cooperative was responsible for selling them externally. A loan of more than 200 jin of grain was also provided to support seven people, including Wei Yongliang, to make shoe nails, earning an average of 70 jin of rice per day, which solved the living problems of 34 people in seven households, including Wei. Organizing the masses to weave baskets, make hemp ropes, and make military shoes also earned a lot of money. In the process of organizing mass production, the cooperative itself has earned 22.16 million yuan from last winter to now, equivalent to 9,634 jin of rice. The reason why the cooperative has achieved these results is mainly because the village and cooperative cadres are actively responsible, thinking of ways to solve the difficulties of the masses according to their needs, and thus winning the support of the masses. The cooperative can actively contact stores and develop with the support of the stores. For goods needed by the masses, the cooperative can directly wholesale from the stores at a lower price, and the fruits and handicrafts that the cooperative needs to sell are all handed over to the stores for consignment sales.

　　根据群众需要经营
  　北窖合作社得到拥护
    【北岳讯】良乡北窖村合作社，从去年三月间组织起来，当时有股金一百万元（边币，下同），售卖油、盐、酱、醋、纸张、肥皂、食粮等物。只能供给群众一些日常用品。去年秋后，由于敌人的封锁，村中大批核桃、杏核销不出去，加上秋田歉收，群众生活非常困难。合作社于是改变了业务方针，大量收买核桃、杏核熬油。不少妇女参加了砸瓤子，推碾等劳动。群众积存的杏核三十石（每斗廿斤），核桃廿万个都有了销路，向外卖油时还赚了运输脚价一百四十二万元，妇女得工资五百四十二万元。群众生活困难解决了，合作社也赚洋八百余万元。冬季，该社又组织妇女六十余人开展纺织，领花一斤交线半斤（赚头愿换粮食也行），总计冬季纺线三百斤，解决了很多人的生活问题，也供给了村中一部分布匹。今春群众缺粮很多，合作社从张坊买到粮食五千斤，组织群众盘粮赚脚。组织铁炉二盘打制农具，由合作社负责向外出售。又贷粮二百余斤，扶助隗永亮等七人打鞋钉，平均每天可赚米七十斤，使隗等七户三十四口人生活问题获得解决。组织群众编筐打麻绳、做军鞋，也赚了不少钱。在组织群众生产的过程中，合作社本身从去冬到现在，也赚了二千二百一十六万元，折米九千六百三十四斤。该社取得这些成绩的原因，主要是由于村社干部积极负责，根据群众需要多想办法，解决群众困难，因而取得群众拥护。该社能主动与商店联系，并在商店扶植下得到发展。凡群众需要的货物，合作社可以直接向商店去批，价钱较贱，合作社需要推销的果子、手工业产品等，也全部交给商店代销。
