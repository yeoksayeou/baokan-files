Mobilizing Women to Participate in Large-Scale Production
	Taihang District Party Committee Convenes Women's Work Conference

	[Taihang News] The Taihang District Party Committee convened a joint conference of women's committees from various district committees from June 17th to 28th. Based on the spirit of the May district committee joint conference, the conference studied and reviewed the history of women's work in Taihang, and determined the new direction for future women's work. The conference conducted detailed discussions on mobilizing women to participate in various productions during land reform, the allocation and training of leading cadres in women's work, and the resolution of women's special issues. At the end of the meeting, Comrade Zhao Shizhen of the District Party Committee delivered a concluding speech. He first pointed out: "The women of Taihang have been considerably mobilized. In the double reduction of 1942 and the production campaign to overcome famine in 1943, the broad masses of women actively participated and improved their social and family status through production, greatly enhancing their awareness. By the time of the land reform in 1946, the guidance was even clearer in mobilizing women to participate, mobilizing and liberating women from the entire peasant liberation movement, thus significantly improving women's class and political consciousness. After the reorganization meeting, to further strengthen women's work, we reallocated forces, equipped institutions, and improved women's organizations, elevating women's work to a more important position. The women in the land reform experimental villages have also gained further mobilization and improvement." Talking about the future direction of women's work, he said: "After the basic completion of land reform work in Taihang, women's work should be valued by the entire party, giving full play to the productive forces of the broad masses of women, participating in large-scale agricultural, industrial, and sideline production, and fully utilizing women's strength to enhance support for the war. And, separately and step by step, with a long-term perspective, achieve family harmony, gender equality, and freedom of marriage, establishing a democratic, free, and happy life for the masses to promote the full development of productive forces, improve women's cultural and political level, and train women cadres. The main criteria for examining women's work in the future are whether the productive forces of women have been fully utilized. If they have been utilized, then there are achievements; otherwise, there are no achievements or the achievements are not significant. Women's work revolves around developing production and promoting democracy. Because the purpose of land reform is to develop productive forces. Solving women's special problems also aims at harmonious families and developing production. As for what production is the main focus, it should be determined according to local conditions and women's own conditions. At the same time, in production, publicize production policies, make plans according to households, and gradually implement family division of labor (not too high), the purpose of which is also to fully utilize women's productive forces, increase family wealth, improve women's status, and improve women's lives. Regarding textiles, the current focus is not on development but on improvement. If it is not improved, the finished products will be difficult to sell. The resolution of women's special problems must be done separately and step by step, and cannot be separated from production. Regarding the leadership of women's work, we should always pay attention to arranging women's work in various tasks. When discussing the allocation and training of cadres, we should pay close attention to the allocation and training of women cadres. The Women's Committee should improve its institutions, strengthen guidance, establish a meeting reporting system, regularly provide information to the Party Committee, raise questions, research and discuss them at various Party meetings, make decisions, and implement them throughout the Party." Comrade Zhao Shizhen repeatedly emphasized that the current center of women's work is to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in the large-scale production movement. The meeting requested that every woman cadre be at ease with her own work, improve her political level, and pay attention to training a large number of women cadres. He called on the participants to study and master the Party's policies well, and study the Party's documents.

　　发动妇女参加大生产
    太行区党委召开妇女工作会议
    【太行讯】太行区党委于六月十七日至二十八日召开各地委妇委联席会议，根据五月地委联席会议的精神，研究检查太行妇女工作的历史，确定今后新的妇女工作方针。会议对土改中发动妇女参加各种生产、妇女工作领导干部的配备与培养，及妇女特殊问题的解决等，均作了详细讨论。会终，区党委赵时真同志作了总结发言，他首先指出：“太行妇女是有相当发动的；一九四二年的双减及一九四三年的生产渡荒，广大妇女都积极参加了，并从生产中提高了自己的社会地位及家庭地位，大大锻炼了妇女的觉悟。至一九四六年土地改革，指导上更明确发动妇女参加，从整个农民解放运动中发动与解放妇女，因而使妇女的阶级觉悟与政治觉悟有了显著提高。整编会议后，为进一步加强妇女工作，重新调动力量，配备机构，健全了妇女组织，将妇女工作更提到重要位置上来。在土改实验村的妇女群众，也获得进一步的发动与提高。”谈到今后妇女工作的方针，他说：“在太行土改工作基本上完成之后，妇女工作更应该为全党所重视，充分发挥广大妇女的生产力，参加大生产运动的农工副业生产；充分发挥妇女力量，增强支援战争。并有分别地、有步骤地从长期着眼，实现家庭和睦，男女平等，婚姻自由，建立群众的民主自由幸福生活，以促进生产力的充分发展，提高妇女的文化政治水平，培养妇女干部。今后考查妇女工作的主要标准，即看是否充分发挥了妇女的生产力，发挥了，即是有成绩，否则即是没有成绩或成绩不大。妇女工作一切围绕发展生产，发扬民主。因为土改目的是为了发展生产力。解决妇女特殊问题，也是以和睦家庭、发展生产为归宿。至于以什么生产为主，应依当地条件与妇女本身条件而定。同时在生产中宣传生产政策，作按家计划，逐步实行家庭分工（不要太高），其目的亦在把妇女生产力充分发挥起来，增加家庭财富，提高妇女地位，改善妇女生活。关于纺织，目前不是发展而是提高，如不提高，则成品难销。对妇女特殊问题的解决，必须有分别、有步骤，且不能离开生产去解决。关于妇女工作的领导，应在各种工作中经常注意布置妇女工作。在讨论干部配备与培养时，应很好注意妇女干部的配备与培养，妇委应健全机构，加强指导，建立会议汇报制，经常向党委提供情况，提出问题，在党的各种会议上研究讨论，做出决定，贯彻全党。”赵时真同志一再强调指出：目前妇女工作的中心是发动广大妇女参加大生产运动。会议要求每个妇女干部安心于自己的工作，提高自己政治水平，并注意培养大批妇女干部。他号召与会者要很好的学习掌握党的政策，研究党的文件。
