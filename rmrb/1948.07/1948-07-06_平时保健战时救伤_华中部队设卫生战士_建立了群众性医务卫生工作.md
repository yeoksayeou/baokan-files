Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd. A certain unit of the Subei Corps of the People's Liberation Army has universally established an organization of health soldiers in its companies, establishing mass medical work. Each squad in the company has one health soldier, and each platoon has a health team leader (or health committee member). One of the team leaders also serves as the company headquarters' health worker. Health soldiers are also set up among the service personnel. Health soldiers are democratically elected by the squad and then approved by the entire company's soldiers' committee. Health soldiers participate in the study and discussion of various health knowledge; in peacetime, they promote and supervise the establishment of various health systems in each squad, understand and report on health conditions; in wartime, they promptly rescue and bandage the wounded without hindering combat. Under the leadership of Wu Wendao, a model health soldier in the seventh squad of the second battalion of a certain detachment, none of the soldiers in the squad suffered from scabies or lice. In addition, health soldiers of a certain detachment cooperate with medical personnel to carry out "four checks" before and after marching, that is, checking whether they have drunk enough water, whether their shoes fit, whether they have washed their feet after arriving at their destination, and whether there are any sick soldiers. This is of great help to the health of the troops. Liu Mang, the health team leader of a certain team, timely used a tourniquet to bandage the first squad leader whose artery was broken, and then carried him to the bandage station for surgery, saving the squad leader's life. In a certain company, more than ten people were wounded in battle, and except for one who was bandaged on the battlefield by medical personnel, the rest were rescued and bandaged by health soldiers. According to the statistics of the unit, the number of wounded rescued and bandaged by health soldiers on the battlefield has increased from 25% to 45%, and even to 70% in the past year. Health soldiers have become powerful assistants to medical work. The unit has now summarized the experience of organizing health soldiers: First, leaders at all levels should attach importance to this work; second, health work should also be regarded as one of the conditions for evaluating merit; third, the medical department should provide timely and specific help to health soldiers and try to help health soldiers establish prestige. The unit is now actively training and cultivating a large number of company health soldiers.

　　平时保健战时救伤
    华中部队设卫生战士
    建立了群众性医务卫生工作
    【新华社华东二日电】解放军苏北兵团某部在连队中普遍设立卫生战士的组织，建立了群众性的医务工作。连队中每班设卫生战士一人，每排设一个卫生组长（或称卫生委员），组长中一人兼任连部卫生工作。在勤杂人员中也同样设有卫生战士。卫生战士是由班内民主选出，再在全连士兵委员会上通过。卫生战士要参加各种卫生常识的学习和讨论；平时推动与督促各班建立各种卫生制度，了解与汇报保健情况；战时则在不妨碍战斗下及时抢救包扎伤员。该部某支队二营七班在该班模范卫生战士吴文道领导下全班没有一个战士生疥疮和虱子的。又某支队卫生战士在行军前后都配合医务人员进行“四查”工作，即查水喝足没有，鞋子合不合脚；到目的地后洗脚没有，以及有无病员。这对部队健康帮助很大。该队卫生组长刘茫及时用止血带将被打断动脉的一班长包扎起来，随后抬到包扎所开刀，救了班长的生命。某连在战斗中负伤十余名，除了其中一名由医务人员在战场上包扎外，其余都是卫生战士抢救包扎的。据该部统计，一年来卫生战士在战场上抢救包扎伤员数字，已由百分之二十五增至百分之四十五，有的甚至到百分之七十。卫生战士已成为医务工作的有力助手。现该部总结了组织卫生战士的经验：第一，各级领导上要重视这一工作；第二，应将保健工作也作为评功条件之一；第三，医务部门要给卫生战士及时与具体的帮助，设法帮助卫生战士建立威信。现该部正积极训练与培养大批连队卫生战士。
