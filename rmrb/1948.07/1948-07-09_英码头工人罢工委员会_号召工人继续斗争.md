　　British Dockworkers' Strike Committee
    Calls on Workers to Continue the Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: Reports from various sources: The London dockworkers' strike, which lasted for sixteen days, automatically resumed on June 30th. In its resumption statement, the strike committee called on workers to continue launching movements to oppose the unjust punishment imposed by the British government on eleven workers who refused to transport zinc oxide. This strike gave British reactionaries a great warning. Not only were the workers not deterred by their threats, but the strike in London expanded to the western British port of Liverpool on the 28th, greatly shaking the British government. The British King immediately declared a "state of emergency in Britain" that night, and the Attlee government invoked the Emergency Powers Act to suppress the strike. According to this act, Attlee could dispatch large numbers of soldiers to various ports to unload goods, and could forcibly requisition people's houses, vehicles, equipment, etc., to transport and store goods. This act had only been adopted once before, twenty-two years ago, by the Conservative government to suppress the national general strike, a move that made the Conservative government notorious at the time. This time, the Labour government's panic-stricken action made members of the British House of Commons "feel astonished" (Associated Press). In the House of Commons, this action was not only criticized by Communist MP Gallacher, "but also strongly opposed by some Labour MPs" (Agence France-Presse). Liverpool Labour MP Mrs. Braddock said: "It is ominous for a Labour government to use emergency laws against strikers."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: TASS reported: Pravda published an article on the 3rd commenting on the British dockworkers' strike, stating: The dockworkers' strike shows that the British working people are now departing from the so-called "time-tested" trade union leadership (referring to the leadership of reactionary trade unions). The course of this strike greatly surprised the British bourgeoisie and its Labour Party servants. The workers have lost their trust in worker "leaders" like Deakin (General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union) and increasingly believe that the Labour Party leaders in the trade unions are defending the interests of the bourgeoisie rather than the interests of the working class. The emergency measures taken by the Labour government have not thwarted the fighting spirit of the workers. The strikers have indeed resumed work, but in an organized manner and in accordance with the resolutions of the strike committee they organized themselves. Although the Labour government is celebrating "victory" amid the cheers of the Conservative Party, their joy has been marred because they know that the struggle will continue and the state of emergency will remain in effect for another month.

　　英码头工人罢工委员会
    号召工人继续斗争
    【新华社陕北七日电】各方报导：坚持了十六天之久的伦敦码头工人的罢工，已于六月三十日自动复工。罢工委员会在其复工声明中，号召工人们继续发动运动，以反对英政府加于十一个拒运氧化锌工人的不公正处罚。这次罢工给了英国反动分子一个很大的警告。工人们不但没有被他们的威胁所吓退，而且，伦敦的罢工于廿八日扩大到英国西部大港利物浦一带，这就大大的震动了英政府。英皇于当夜立即宣布“英国处于紧急状态”，艾德礼政府乃引用紧急权力法案来镇压罢工。根据这一法案，艾德礼可以派遣大批士兵去各港口卸货，可以强迫征用人民房屋、车辆、装备等去运输及存积货物这一法案只在廿二年以前曾一度为保守党政府所采取，用来镇压过全国总罢工，此种举措在当时曾使保守党政府声名狼籍。这次工党政府如此惊惶失措的行动，使得英国下院议员们也“觉得惊异”（合众社）。在下院中，这一行动不但受到英共议员加拉彻的抨击，“而且受到某些工党议员的强烈反对”（法新社）。利物浦工党议员布拉多克夫人说：“一个劳工政府使用紧急法案反对罢工者是不详的。”
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社讯：真理报于三日撰文评论英国码头工人的罢工称：码头工人的罢工表明，目前英国劳动人民正离开了所谓“久经考验”的工会领导（按指反动工会的领导）。这次罢工的经过，使英国资产阶级及其工党仆役大为吃惊。工人们已丧失了对狄金（运输及各业工人工会总书记）之流的工人“领袖”的信任，并日益相信，工会中工党领袖们是在卫护资产阶级的利益而不是卫护工人阶级的利益。工党政府所采取的紧急措施，没有挫折工人们的斗争精神，罢工者固然是复工了，但是是有组织的，而且是遵照自己所组织的罢工委员会的决议的。虽然工党政府正在保守党的欢呼中庆祝“胜利”，然而他们的欢乐却已受创，因为他们知道斗争将继续进行，紧急状态仍要保持一个月。
