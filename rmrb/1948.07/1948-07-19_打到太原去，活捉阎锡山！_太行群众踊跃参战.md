　　March on Taiyuan, Capture Yan Xishan Alive!
    The Taihang Masses Eagerly Join the War

    [Taihang Dispatch] "March on Taiyuan, capture Yan Xishan alive!" In the recent Jinzhong Campaign, the broad masses of the Taihang Second Military Sub-district and over a dozen counties in the First Military Sub-district spontaneously organized themselves to undertake tasks such as carrying stretchers, transportation, and providing medical aid, enthusiastically assisting the People's Liberation Army. This demonstrated the high level of political consciousness and the spirit of hard struggle of the people in the liberated areas. In addition to completing the logistical tasks at the front lines, they also helped the masses in the border areas with weeding and harvesting during lulls in the fighting. On June 21st, the First Company of the First Battalion of stretchers from Xiyang arrived in Xucun and harvested 51 mu of wheat for the masses in one night. The Second, Fourth, and Fifth Companies also helped the masses in their stationed villages with weeding, gaining the enthusiastic support of the border area masses and strengthening the relationship between the front and the rear. Farmer Zhang Niuxiao, who was helped, said, "We are truly all one family under heaven." In completing the logistical tasks, the civilian laborers were even more brave and determined, and many heroes and role models have emerged. The first batch of civilian laborers from Xiangyuan had just returned from participating in the Linfen campaign, and the second batch went to Jinzhong. Civilian labor cadres Su Zhagou and Zhao Haiman voluntarily carried 50 jin of grain, influencing other civilian laborers to also carry more. During breaks, the civilian laborers also carried water and helped with work for the masses, publicizing various policies of the liberated areas. Many people were commended and awarded in the merit-awarding movement. When the civilian laborers set out, weeding and the summer harvest were in full swing. The villages fully organized the semi-able-bodied labor force to complete the farm work on time, eliminating the family concerns of the participating civilian laborers and directly ensuring the successful completion of the participation task. In Heiyan Village, Qi District, Zuoquan, 40 male laborers participated in the war, and 123 women, children, and elderly men in the village participated in weeding and harvesting, undertaking the same glorious major production task as the young and strong who went to the front to participate in the war. In seven days, they weeded all 1,563 mu of seedlings in the entire village. They wrote to the participants, saying: "The seedlings in our village have all been weeded. We hope you don't worry and focus on cooperating with the army to fight Yan Xishan." In Shimen and Shangbeizhang in the Second District of Wuxiang, and Podi and other villages in the Sixth District, they all first did the work for the participating civilian laborers. When the civilian laborers in Podi Village set out, they mutually guaranteed to do the work in their fields well. The civilian laborers guaranteed not to desert, not to violate mass discipline, and to obey orders.
