Xinhua News Agency, Xiangyang Front, July 27th: A frontline reporter reports on the capture of the Kuomintang secret service chief Kang Ze during the liberation of Xiangyang. After the People's Liberation Army entered the Jianghan and Tongbai areas earlier this year, Chiang Kai-shek immediately established a Pacification Headquarters in Xiangyang, a transportation hub for the four provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei, and appointed the notorious secret service chief Kang Ze as the commander. Among all eighteen Pacification Zones of Chiang's bandits, this was the first time such a secret service chief was appointed as commander. This not only demonstrates the important military significance of Xiangyang but also illustrates that Chiang Kai-shek, having suffered repeated defeats on the Central Plains front, directly adopted a secret service military rule in a vain attempt to sustain his failing situation.

Xiangyang faces the Han River to the northeast and directly east, and is surrounded by mountains such as Pipa, Zhenwu, and Fenghuang to the southwest and south, making its terrain very dangerous. The bandit Kang relied on the mountains to construct a strong defense system, and inherited the Japanese invaders' "Three Alls Policy," demolishing all the houses of the people in the urban areas and the suburbs, attempting to prevent the Liberation Army from approaching the city walls. Deep trenches up to ten feet deep were dug outside the city, and landmines were laid throughout the barbed wire and obstacles. When the People's Liberation Army launched the Xiangfan Campaign, the bandit Kang ordered the local Chiang troops and two regular brigades from Fancheng and other places to retreat to Xiangyang, thinking that the deep trenches and high walls, combined with concentrated forces, would ensure a solid defense. Unexpectedly, the Liberation Army, with a force equal in number to the enemy, adopted a back-to-the-river strategy and captured Xiangyang in one fell swoop.

When the People's Liberation Army attacked the Black Tiger Weir high ground outside Xiangyang, the inhuman bandit Kang released a large amount of poison gas and hung white cloths more than ten feet high on the roads of the Liberation Army's advance, writing, "Those who invade will die!" He attempted to use poison gas and incantations to hinder the offensive of the Liberation Army. But this only aroused the unparalleled anger of the Liberation Army soldiers. "Take Xiangyang and capture Kang Ze alive" became the unanimous action slogan of the entire army. Ninety percent of the soldiers in the sixth company of a certain unit volunteered to join the assault. After the general offensive began, the assault team climbed the city wall in just five minutes. The company commander of the first company of the assault team gloriously sacrificed himself, and the platoon leader automatically led the charge. When the platoon leader was wounded or killed, the squad leaders and soldiers continued to charge forward. The heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, one after another, finally overwhelmed the enemy, broke into the city, and captured Kang Ze alive, fulfilling the goal set by the slogan and the wishes of the soldiers.

When the battle had clearly become hopeless, the bandit Kang even threatened his soldiers, saying, "Die in battle or commit suicide; do not become a prisoner of the Communist bandits." But the Kuomintang officers and soldiers no longer listened to his commands and surrendered to the Liberation Army in batches. Finally, the Liberation Army entered the city, and Kang Ze personally led a regiment of troops to guard the Bell and Drum Tower, making a desperate struggle in an attempt to gain an opportunity to escape in disguise. However, this unit he led was the 104th Brigade, which had been annihilated in the Hua (County) Jun (County) campaign in northern Henan in November 1946. The Liberation Army soldiers who had been liberated from the Hua-Jun campaign actively used loudspeakers to call on those at the Bell and Drum Tower to surrender, and this regiment quickly abandoned the bandit Kang and surrendered completely. The secret service chief Kang Ze, who had neither "sacrificed heroically" in combat as Deng Wenyi had said, nor committed "suicide" according to his own slogan, obediently became a prisoner. This ruthless secret service chief, who usually rode roughshod over unarmed people and framed countless young people, has finally reached the time when his evil deeds are full and he will receive the final judgment of the people.

### 背水作战下襄阳钟鼓楼中擒康泽

　　背水作战下襄阳钟鼓楼中擒康泽
    【新华社襄阳前线二十七日电】前线记者报导此次解放襄阳，活捉法西斯特务头子康泽的经过称：今年年初人民解放军进入江汉、桐柏地区后，蒋介石立刻在川陕豫鄂四省交通总枢纽的襄阳设置了一个绥靖区司令部，而以臭名远播的特务头子康泽为司令官。在蒋匪所有的十八个绥靖区之中，以这样的特务头子来当司令官的，还是第一个。这不仅说明了襄阳在军事上的重要意义，更说明了在中原前线连吃败仗的蒋介石曾直接采取特务军事统治来妄图撑持其败局。
    襄阳东北和正东面临汉水，西南和南面有琵琶、真武、凤凰等山耸立，形势十分险要。康匪依山构筑了强固防御体系，并继承日寇的三光政策，把城关和四郊老百姓的房屋全部拆毁，企图这样隔绝解放军接近城垣。城下又筑有深达三丈徐的三道外壕，在铁丝网和障碍物内满布着地雷。当解放军发起襄樊战役时，康匪便命令樊城等地土蒋军及两个正规旅退守襄阳城，满以为深沟高垒，集中兵力，可以固守。不料解放军仅以总数与敌人相等的兵力，并采用背水作战，一举而下襄阳。
    当解放军攻击襄阳城外黑虎堰制高点时，灭绝人性的康匪即大量施放毒气，并在解放军前进的道上，挂起丈多高的白布，上写：“来犯者送死！”他企图利用毒气和符咒来阻遏解放军的攻势。但是这样只更加激起了解放军将士无比的愤怒，“打下襄阳，活捉康泽”，成为全军一致的行动口号。某部六连百分之九十的战士报名参加突击。总攻开始后，突击队仅五分钟就登上城头。突击队的第一连连长光荣牺牲了，排长就自动率领冲锋；排长伤亡了，班长、战士们继续冲上去。解放军战士们前仆后继的英勇作战终于压倒敌人，突入城内，活捉康泽，实现了口号规定的目的和战士们的愿望。
    当战事发展已显然无望时，康匪还对他的士兵威胁说：“不战死就自杀，不当共匪俘虏。”但国民党官兵这时已不再听他的指挥了，一批批地向解放军缴械投降。最后解放军攻入城内，康泽亲率一团兵力把守钟鼓楼，作绝望的挣扎，企图赢得一个化装逃命的机会。但他所率领的这支部队就是曾在一九四六年十一月豫北滑（县）浚（县）战役被歼灭过的一零四旅。解放军从滑浚战役解放过来的解放战士，便纷纷对钟鼓楼进行火线喊话，这一团人也很快就抛弃康匪，全部投降了。而特务头子康泽，这时既没有象邓文仪所说的在作战中“壮烈牺牲”，也没有照他自己的口号实行“自杀”，而是服服贴贴地当了俘虏。这个杀人不眨眼的特务头子，平时压在手无寸铁的老百姓头上横行霸道，陷害无数青年，现在终于到了他恶贯满盈受人民最后审判的时候。
