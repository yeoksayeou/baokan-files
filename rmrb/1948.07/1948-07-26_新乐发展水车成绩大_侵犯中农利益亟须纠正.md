[Report from Central Hebei] Xinle County has made great achievements in developing waterwheels and water conservancy since the February production conference. From February to June, according to incomplete statistics, 615 new waterwheels have been added, 330 old waterwheels have been repaired, 105 new wells have been dug, and 228 old wells have been repaired. This has greatly saved labor and increased the area of irrigated land. The reasons for these achievements are mainly the leadership's attention and the cadres' active organization and leadership. At the February production conference, the leadership emphasized the large-scale development of waterwheels and water conservancy. After the meeting, county and district cadres actively publicized and mobilized in various villages, issued large amounts of loans, and drove private capital to organize well-digging and the purchase and repair of waterwheels. The cooperative promoted loans to help iron factories build waterwheels, lending out 89 and selling 216, and also lending out more than 400 million yuan for water conservancy. Gangtou Village used floating wealth to buy 44 waterwheels, and also used confiscated trees to make some water buckets and frames. However, in the use and management of waterwheels, some villages in the county have developed serious shortcomings and biases. Some villages forcibly unified the distribution and average use of all waterwheels in the village, thus infringing on the interests of middle peasants and greatly affecting production. Last year, Song Village bought back waterwheel iron wheels and asked middle peasants to provide buckets; it was stipulated that the original waterwheels in the village would be used collectively, which caused great dissatisfaction among households with waterwheels (mainly middle peasants). Up to now, only five have been installed, and more than 30 wheels and 60 buckets are still lying in the street, unattended. After the old waterwheels were collectivized, no one repaired them, and the buckets all leaked. This kind of commandism, violating the principle of mutual assistance and voluntariness for the benefit of both, and infringing on the ownership and use rights of waterwheel owners, also exists in other villages (Zhu Village is correcting it). If this is not corrected quickly, it will inevitably affect water conservancy construction and increased production.

### 新乐发展水车成绩大　侵犯中农利益亟须纠正

　　新乐发展水车成绩大
  　侵犯中农利益亟须纠正
    【冀中讯】新乐县自二月生产会议以来，在发展水车、开展水利上已有很大成绩。从二月至六月间，据不完全统计，已增加新水车六百一十五辆，修理旧水车三百三十辆，打新井一百零五眼，修理旧井二百二十八眼。大大节省了劳力，增加了水利面积。获到这些成绩的原因，主要是领导上的重视和干部的积极组织领导。在二月生产会议上，领导上强调提出大量发展水车，开展水利；会后县区干部又到各村积极宣传动员发放大批贷款，带动浮财私资，组织打井和购买、修理水车。推进社贷款扶助铁工厂造水车，先后贷出八十九辆，卖出二百一十六辆，另贷出水利款四万万多元。岗头村用浮财买水车四十四辆，还用没收的树木打一些水斗子和车架子。在水车的使用和管理上，该县某些村庄则产生了严重的缺点和偏向。有些村庄强制全村水车统一分配和平均使用，因而侵犯了中农的利益，使生产受到不少影响。宋村去年买回水车铁轮、让中农出斗子；规定村中原有水车归伙使用，引起有水车户（主要是中农）很不满意。到现在只按上了五辆，还有三十多辆车、六十多个斗子在街上扔着没人管。旧水车归伙后，因没人修理，斗子都漏了水。这种强迫命令、违犯互助自愿等两利的原则、侵犯水车主的所有权与使用权的现象别村也有（朱村正纠正中），如不很快纠正，势必影响水利建设和增加生产。
