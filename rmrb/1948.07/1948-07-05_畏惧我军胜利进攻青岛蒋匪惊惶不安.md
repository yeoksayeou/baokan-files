Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd. Fearing the victorious offensive of the Shandong People's Liberation Army, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Qingdao are anxious and uneasy. They have recently announced the implementation of the so-called "Qingdao City Garrison Plan," which stipulates the implementation of traffic light and light control, as well as emergency assembly into street fighting fortifications and the excavation of air-raid shelters. It is also stipulated that from mid-May to the end of July, surprise household checks and the formation of "Defense Teams" will be carried out in stages. At the same time, inspections, patrols, and surveillance of schools, factories, and citizens will be strengthened, and it has been announced that those who do not report their household registration will be seized for military service. In addition, they have strengthened their original fascist-style police-managed district system, with the Civil Affairs and Police Bureaus jointly operating "Household Administration." All Bao office outposts also form joint offices with police stations.
