Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Following the capture of Kaifeng by the People's Liberation Army, a new wave of panic and more open mutual recrimination has emerged within the Nanjing puppet government. Chiang Kai-shek remained in Xi'an on the 24th and had not returned. At the same time, the Nanjing puppet Legislative Yuan held a secret meeting on the same day to "review the military situation." "When the legislators analyzed the reasons for the deteriorating military situation, they turned their attention to Chiang Kai-shek... Some legislators said that one of the reasons for the failure was that Chiang Kai-shek directly commanded the movements of the field armies, even down to the regimental level, depriving many field commanders of their power. They said that no troops could move without an order issued by the Chairman from Nanjing, which caused the fall of Luoyang. ... The same thing happened in Kaifeng." (According to the Associated Press). He Yingqin also took the opportunity to attack Chiang Kai-shek at this time. "He Yingqin told the legislators who demanded an investigation into the fall of Kaifeng that it was Chiang Kai-shek himself, not the Ministry of National Defense, who issued the combat orders. ... Neither the Minister of National Defense nor the Chief of Staff (i.e., Gu Zhutong) often knew how the troops were deployed, because the Chairman directly ordered the transfers." (According to the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse).

　　南京内部混乱
    伪立委等公开攻击蒋介石
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】开封为人民解放军攻克后，南京伪政府内部表现出一次新的惊慌与更公开地互相埋怨。蒋介石二十四日仍停留西安未归，与此同时，南京伪立法院则于同日召开秘密会议，“检讨军事”。“当立委们分析军事情势恶化的原因时，又将其目光转向蒋介石。……若干立委称：失败的原因之一，就是蒋介石直接指挥野战军的调动，甚至下达团一级，剥夺了许多野战司令官的权力。他们说：除非有委员长由南京发出的命令，任何军队都不能动，这曾造成了洛阳的陷落。………同样的事情也在开封发生了。”（据合众社）。何应钦也于此时乘机攻击蒋介石。“何应钦告诉要求调查开封失陷原因的立法委员们说，是蒋介石本人而不是国防部发出作战命令。……不论是国防部长或是参谋总长（按即顾祝同）都时常不知道军队的布置如何，因为委员长直接下令调动。”（据美联社及法新社）
