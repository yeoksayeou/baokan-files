　　Xiaofeng Village, Gaocheng
  　Problems with Wheat Procurement Leadership
  　Branch and Poor Peasants League Should Not Replace the Government
    [This Newspaper's Report] In Xiaofeng Village, Gaocheng, bad elements once took control of the Poor Peasants League. They attacked activists, stopped branch activities, made veteran village cadres passive, forced middle peasants to borrow grain, and carried out indiscriminate confiscations, undermining the unity of the masses. Although the branch work, which had been suspended, was later restored, the relationship between the branch and the Poor Peasants League remained very poor. This time, Zhang Zhucheng (a Party member), the vice-chairman of the Poor Peasants League, returned from the county wheat procurement conference and conveyed the spirit of the wheat procurement at the branch committee meeting. The branch decided to convene a general meeting of Party members to mobilize. The Party members (especially the veteran cadres) mistakenly thought that this was the work of the Poor Peasants League and were very unhappy. When Li Hexian, the former village chief, received the meeting notice, he questioned the branch secretary: "Who is this being assigned to? If it is assigned to the Party, we will do it; if it is assigned to the Poor Peasants League, we will not care." At the general meeting of Party members, some veteran cadres expressed unwillingness to cooperate with the new cadres, and even advocated separating into different groups to collect grain and see who had the higher prestige. In the end, the branch secretary and the vice-chairman of the Poor Peasants League insisted on the correct position: new and old cadres help each other, and the branch leads the Poor Peasants League to do it together. At that time, it was also decided that the branch and the Poor Peasants League would each send fifteen people to form a collection committee, and Party members would guarantee completion. In addition, it was decided to hire some impartial farmers to participate in the evaluation. Although the principles were determined in this way, there were still twists and turns in the implementation. First of all, the Poor Peasants League did not have enough prestige, so the chairman, Li Jifu (newly elected, non-Party member), only had one or two people attend the first meeting he convened. At this time, the branch patiently persuaded the Party members and the masses to fully support the Poor Peasants League to complete the collection work. As a result, the meeting was held, and it was decided to proceed in three steps: first, post preliminary notices based on the equal land distribution register to solicit opinions. Second, evaluation, passed by the village meeting. Third, enter collection. After the meeting, new and old cadres, branch members, and Poor Peasants League members were mixed and divided into three groups to start work. The propaganda team immediately broadcast the news to the entire village. The collection committee members worked very actively. The next day, land notices were posted on the street, detailing the name and output of each plot of land for each household, as well as how much wheat was planted, and who the neighbors were, so that comparisons could be made. The person writing in front of the notice registered the opinions of the households, and the village deputy was responsible for explaining to the masses. In this way, in two days, more than fifty households (accounting for a quarter of the total number of households in the village) submitted more than seventy opinions. The collection committee made an assessment based on these opinions and determined the households to be reduced or exempted, and then announced them to everyone for comments. During the discussion of who should be reduced or exempted, there were many disputes among the masses. In order to explain that the collection should take into account and reward intensive cultivation and more grain production, the collection committee specifically cited the example of Li Shuangxi to guide everyone; Li Shuangxi is twenty-two years old, and the four acres of land he cultivates has a rated yield of 1.2 shi (石) per mu (亩) according to the land quality, but he is very lazy, does not apply fertilizer, and does not fill in pits, so the actual yield is only 0.8 shi (石). In such a situation, the collection should be based on the normal yield, that is, the rated yield according to the land quality, rather than the actual yield. Everyone strongly agreed with this approach. Because the evaluation was relatively fair and reasonable, the masses in the entire village were extremely enthusiastic about paying grain.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    Editor's note: There are some problems with Xiaofeng Village's approach that need to be considered. First, wheat procurement is a part of the government's work and should be led by the village political committee. The branch and the Poor Peasants League should ensure fairness and reasonableness in self-reporting and public discussion, but they must not take over and replace the government, creating a situation where the Party and the government are not separated, and the government and the people are not separated, increasing the anarchy of village-level work. Second, according to the report, the village did not involve middle peasants in the leadership of wheat procurement, but simply relied on the Poor Peasants League to carry out wheat procurement. This cannot guarantee the implementation of a fair policy for the burden on middle peasants. As for the poor relationship between the village branch and the Poor Peasants League, the low prestige of the Poor Peasants League, etc., further investigation and research are still needed.

### 藁城小奉化村　麦征领导有毛病　支部和贫农团不应代替政权

　　藁城小奉化村
  　麦征领导有毛病
  　支部和贫农团不应代替政权
    【本报讯】藁城小奉化村坏分子曾一度掌握了贫农团，它打击了积极分子，停止了支部活动，使老村干消极起来，强迫中农借粮，滥行没收，破坏了群众的团结。后来虽然恢复了一度停止活动的支部工作，但支部和贫农团的关系还很恶劣。这回贫农团副主席张柱成（党员）从县里参加麦征会议回来，在支委会上传达了麦征精神，支部决定召开党员大会进行动员。党员们（特别是老干部）把这事情误认为是贫农团的工作，很不高兴，当旧任村长李鹤仙接到开会通知时，就向支部书记质问：“这是给谁布置的？给党布置的就干，给贫农团布置的咱就不管。”在党员大会上有的老干部表示不愿和新干部合作，甚至主张分开片来各征各的，看看谁的威信高。最后还是支部书记和贫农团副主席坚持了正确的立场：新老干部互助合作，支部领导贫农团结合着做。当时并决定了支部贫农团各出十五个人组成征收委员会，党员保证完成。此外还决定聘请一部分公正农民参加评议。原则虽然这样确定了，但在执行中还有曲折的。首先贫农团的威信不够高，所以正主席李纪福（新选的、非党员）头一次召集会只到了一两个人，这时支部很耐心的说服了党员和群众，要全力支持贫农团来完成征收工作。结果会议开成了，并决定分三个步骤来进行：第一步根据平分地亩册先贴草榜征求意见。第二步评议，开村民大会通过。第三步进入征收。会后新老干部、支部党员及贫农团混合分了三撮开始工作，宣传股马上将这些消息广播到全村。征收委员们工作很积极，第二天街上就贴了地亩榜，详细的写着每户每块地的地名及产量，还有种麦多少，四邻是谁，以便进行比较。榜前执笔的登记着花户们的意见，村副负责给群众解释。这样两天时间，收集了五十多户（占全村户数四分之一）提出的七十多条意见。征收委员根据这些意见作了评定，确定了减免户，然后再宣布给大家征求意见。在讨论谁减谁免时，群众中有许多争辩，征收委员会为了说明在征收中要照顾奖励精耕细作，多打粮食，特别举了李双喜的例子来引导大家；李双喜二十二岁，他种的四亩地如按地质定产量为一石二斗，但他很懒，不上粪，不填坑，所以实产量只有八斗，象这样的情形应按长年应产量即按地质定产量征收，而不应按实产量，大家非常同意这种办法。全村由于评议得比较公平合理，群众缴粮异常踊跃。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：小奉化村这种作法，有些问题需要考虑。第一、麦征工作是政权工作的一部分，应当由村政委员会来领导。支部和贫农团在自报公议中应保证公平合理，但决不可以包办代替，形成党政不分，政民不分，增加村级工作的无政府状态。第二、从报导来看，该村在麦征中并未吸收中农参加领导，而是单纯由贫农团来搞麦征，这是不可能保证贯彻对中农负担公平的政策的。至于该村支部同贫农团关系恶劣，贫农团威信不高等方面，仍须进一步调查研究。（药夫、槐玉）
