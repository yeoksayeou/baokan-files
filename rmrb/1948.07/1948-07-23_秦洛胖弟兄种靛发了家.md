　　Qin Luo Fatty Brothers Became Rich by Growing Indigo
    Yao Fu, Huai Yu
    As soon as you arrive north of Zhidu Village in Gaocheng, you see several large rectangular gray pools by the roadside, clean and bright. Bare-backed villagers, with their pants rolled up, are in the fields next to the pools, some applying fertilizer, some hoeing seedlings. The seedlings are chopstick-high, tender green, and in rows. This is the indigo that the farmers of Zhidu Village rely on to get rich.

    Zhidu Village has been growing indigo continuously for four years. In the first year, when they started experimenting, people were afraid of wasting their efforts. Only Qin Luo Fatty and his younger brother Qin Zhaolin and eight other households planted fifteen or sixteen mu. When Qin Luo Fatty pulled up the wheat to plant indigo, his wife disagreed, saying, "If you don't plant yams or beans, what will you eat?" Luo Fatty didn't listen to her, thinking, "Let's give it a try." So he and Zhaolin planted one and a half mu together. When the indigo was harvested at the beginning of autumn, it wasn't sold right away, and his wife complained, "You eat indigo!" The villagers also ridiculed him, saying, "If you can't sell the indigo, it's good for whitewashing walls." Some called them the "Embrace Poverty Team." But in less than a few days, the indigo was sold out, which was unexpected. The price was very high. The production from one and a half mu of indigo could buy ten shi of millet. He and his brother bought a waterwheel and a donkey together, and immediately planted another crop of vegetables. People who hadn't planted indigo saw them getting rich. The second year, when the cadres came to the village to mobilize people to plant indigo, the village naturally increased by seventeen households, planting more than fifty mu. Luo Fatty planted skillfully. In the first year, he harvested one shi and two dou of wheat from 1.2 mu, and sold the indigo for 1.6 million yuan. In the third season, he harvested six cartloads of cabbage, selling them for one million yuan, leaving two carts for the whole family to eat all winter. He bought another donkey. The amount of fertilizer in the fields also increased unprecedentedly, with 1,440 jin of sesame cake fertilizer applied to his 8.5 mu of land. Xin Zhongnong Wang Liang, a farming household who used to irrigate and roll the fields, also bought a waterwheel with Qin Gouzi last autumn, and bought a donkey himself this spring. Qin Xiaohei also bought an ox. Qin Luoxiu, who was the most in difficulty, also increased the amount of fertilizer in his fields, and his production was enough to eat. This year, the whole village has developed to more than fifty households planting indigo, with more than one hundred mu planted. Last year there were only three pools, this year they have increased to ten. Qin Luo Fatty and his brother have become indigo-making technicians in the village. Because they worked very meticulously, the dye houses came to buy from them, saying their goods were strong. Some merchants even asked Luo Fatty to buy on their behalf, effectively becoming an agent for selling indigo to the outside. Now the influence of Zhidu Village getting rich by growing indigo has spread to nearby villages, and five or six villages around it have begun to learn how to grow and make indigo.

　　秦洛胖弟兄种靛发了家
    药夫、槐玉
    一走到藁城只都村北，便看见路旁有几个长方形的大灰池子，洁白光亮。赤着背的老乡们卷起裤子，在池旁的地里，有的上粪，有的锄苗。苗子有筷子高、嫩绿成行，这便是只都村农民们赖以发财致富的蓝靛。
    只都村连续种靛已经四年。第一年开头试验时，人们都怕白闹了，只有秦洛胖和他弟弟秦兆林等八户种了十五六亩。秦洛胖拔了麦子要种靛时，他媳妇不同意，说：“不栽山药不种豆你吃啥？”洛胖没听她的话，心想：“试试看。”便和兆林伙种了一亩半。立秋打下靛暂时没有卖出去，他媳妇埋怨说：“你吃靛吧！”村里的老乡也讽刺他说：“卖不了靛刷灰墙倒不错”。有的叫他们“抱穷队”。但是不到几天把靛卖完了，出乎别人意料之外，价钱很贵，一亩半靛的生产能够买十大石小米。他弟兄两个合买了一架水车和一头毛驴，立刻又种了一季菜。没种靛的人们看着他们发了财，第二年干部来村上动员种靛时，村里自然而然又增加了十七户，种了五十余亩。洛胖因种的得法，第一年一亩二分地打麦一石二，卖靛一百六十万元，第三季又收下白菜六大车，卖了一百万元，剩下两车全家吃了一冬。他又买了一头毛驴。地里的粪也空前增加，八亩半地上了一千四百四十斤麻饼。种靛户新中农王亮向来浇地打辘辘，去年过秋也与秦狗子合买了一辆水车，今春自己又买了一头驴。秦小黑也买了一头牛，最困难的秦洛休，地里也增加了肥料，生产的也够吃了。今年全村种靛已发展到五十余户，种靛百余亩。去年仅三个池子，今年增加到十个。秦洛胖弟兄成了村里打靛的技师。因为他们作的很细致，染坊里都找上门来买，并说数他们的货强。有的商人还托洛胖代买，实际上成了对外销靛的经记人。现在只都村种靛发财的影响，已传遍了附近村庄，在它周围已经有五、六个村庄开始学习种靛打靛了。
