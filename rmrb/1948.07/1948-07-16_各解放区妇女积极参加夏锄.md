Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Women in the liberated areas are actively participating in summer weeding and sideline production, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor in rural areas during wartime.

In Laiyang Southwest County, Jiaodong, 300,000 mu of spring fields have all been weeded due to the large number of women participating in summer weeding. More than 62,000 women in Yexian South County are engaged in sideline production such as weaving straw hat braids and making *buguzi* (shoe-making material), earning more than 900 million North Sea currency in two and a half months. In Sanlidian Village, Zanhua County, Bohai, 250 women wove more than 520 bolts of cloth in three months, earning 7.7 million yuan, which solved the problem of food shortages for each household during summer weeding.

In Xiaoxi Hedicun Village, Shuoxian County, Jin-Sui Border Region, led by Liu Fulin's wife, the director of the Farmers' Association, all 118 young and middle-aged women in the village weeded 826 mu of land in ten days, accounting for two-fifths of the village's cultivated land, freeing up 41 male laborers to engage in salt boiling and transportation, earning enough food for 150 people for half a month. In Qulicun Village, Lanxian County, 96 women have finished weeding their own crops and organized 35 physically strong women to work as short-term laborers in other villages. In Zhaizicun Village, Jiaocheng County, when men went to the front line to carry stretchers and transport supplies, young and middle-aged women organized four labor exchange teams to carry out weeding and plowing.

In Hulan County, Songjiang, Northeast China, more than 5,000 women went to the fields to weed, and to date, nearly 3,000 *qing* of large fields have been weeded. Women in Gunan Well Village, Xinhai County, Mudanjiang, developed a relay method of shoveling grass, which greatly increased the speed of shoveling grass. In Keshan County, Heilongjiang, during the summer weeding, 53 female labor heroes, 12 model groups, and 6 model cadres emerged, adding a group of female backbones to the countryside.
