　　【Jinan News】The Liqun Weaving Factory in Nanguan Street, Handan, had not made any money since its establishment in August of last year. It closed down in May of this year, and the workers lost their jobs. Worker Li Qinglian was unwilling to let the factory continue to collapse, so he and the board of directors studied and reviewed the reasons for the previous failure: (1) The distribution of employees was unreasonable. Out of a total of twelve people, four were staff members, five were apprentices, and only three were technical workers. There were too many people detached from production, and expenses were high. Wages, food, and miscellaneous expenses accounted for half of the cost. (2) Out of a total capital of 2.5 million yuan, furniture accounted for half. Especially in the summer, the sales of finished products were not good, and the funds became stagnant and could not be turned over. (3) The factory's general manager and deputy manager both held concurrent positions (the general manager was the manager of Shenyuanhao Grocery Store, and the deputy manager was the director of the Citizens' Association), and they did their duties for free. They were unwilling in their hearts and felt it was delaying their own business. Sometimes, when citizens made suggestions to them, they could not accept them, and their emotions became even more depressed, and they just wanted to withdraw their heads to do their own business. In response to the above shortcomings, it was decided to reorganize and open again based on the principle of benefiting both labor and management. The entire factory was reduced to six people, with Li Qinglian as the manager, one accountant, two technical workers, and two apprentices. Three machines were opened, and outside workers were used when busy. This could reduce expenses by half. Worker Lao He said, "This time, there is not a single idle person in the entire factory, and the manager also participates in labor. This time, making money is a certainty!" (Dian Chen)

　　改善经营方法利群工厂复业
    【冀南讯】邯郸南关街利群织工厂，从去年八月成立，一直没有赚钱，到今年五月关了门，工人也失了业。工人李青莲不愿让工厂一直垮下去，就和董事会研究检讨了以前垮台的原因：（一）职工分配不合理，一共十二人，光职员就占四人，学徒五人，技术工人只有三人，脱离生产的人多、开支大，光工资伙食杂花等开支就占成本一半。（二）一共二百五十万元本钱、家具就占一半，特别到了夏季，成品销路不广，资金成了死的，周转不开。（三）工厂正副经理都是兼差（正经理是慎源号杂货铺的经理，副总理是市民会主任），白尽义务，心里不愿意，嫌耽误自己生意。有时市民对他们提些意见，接受不了，情绪更加低落，光想抽了头去作自己的买卖。针对着上面缺点，就决定本着劳两利的办法，重新组织开张，全厂减为六人，由李青莲任经理，会计一人，技术工人二人，学徒二人，开三台机，忙时用外工，这样可以减去一半开支。工人老贺说：“这回全厂没有一个闲人，经理也参加劳动，这下赚钱说啥！”（殿臣）
