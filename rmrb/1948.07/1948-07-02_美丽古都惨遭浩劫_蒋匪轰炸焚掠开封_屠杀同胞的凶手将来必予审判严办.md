Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 27th: A front-line reporter in Kaifeng reports: Chiang Kai-shek bandits committed heinous and inhuman crimes in Kaifeng. Starting from the 18th of this month, the city was subjected to round-the-clock bombing by large numbers of American and Canadian-aided Chiang Kai-shek bombers. The enemy troops defending the city, before being annihilated, also engaged in frenzied arson, slaughter, and looting. A large number of buildings have been reduced to ashes, and it is currently impossible to fully count the casualties among the citizens. According to statistics from Tongji Hospital on Songmen Street alone, on the 22nd and 23rd, over 600 people were treated at the hospital for bomb-related injuries. The losses of lives and property of the people in Kaifeng due to this atrocity by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were unprecedentedly severe. Even the puppet legislators from Henan Province in Nanjing had to submit a petition to the puppet Executive Yuan President, Weng Wenhao, "urging Weng to order government planes to stop bombing Kaifeng city to protect civilians" (Associated Press). The puppet Legislative Yuan also resolved that "blind bombing of cities should be avoided in the future" (United Press). This shows how profound the crime of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in destroying peaceful residents was, and what a huge responsibility the American government, which actively aids Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and continuously supplies him with instruments of murder, should share for this crime.

Prior to this battle, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits forcibly occupied scenic spots and historical sites inside and outside the city, such as the ancient Dragon Pavilion, Drum Tower, Yuwangtai, as well as Henan University school buildings, and the South Gate Post Office, to construct fortifications. On the 18th, before the enemy at the South Gate was defeated and fled into the city, they burned down the agricultural college of Henan University and the flour company, among other buildings, and the fire raged for three days. Before the enemy at Caoguan fled into the city, they also poured kerosene on houses and set them on fire. American-supplied Chiang Kai-shek planes also dropped incendiary bombs at the South Gate, and over a thousand civilian houses were reduced to ashes. The known number of dead and injured residents exceeds sixty. On the 19th, when the People's Liberation Army entered the city from the South Gate, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' artillery fire was still concentrated on bombarding the South Gate. American-supplied Chiang Kai-shek planes again dropped incendiary bombs. Shops on South Gate Street, the Refugee New Village, and the Gospel Hall buildings were partially destroyed, and charred corpses were visible everywhere. The enemy trapped inside the city, whenever facing unfavorable combat situations, would set fires or have Chiang Kai-shek planes drop incendiary bombs, attempting to use this to impede the PLA's offensive. The most prosperous Zhongshan Street, Madao Street, and Drum Tower Street in the entire city were all set on fire. The South Wu Printing House, China-West Pharmacy, and China Industrial Enterprise Society buildings were mostly destroyed by fire. The routed enemy, under the pretext of requisitioning boxes and other items to build fortifications, entered homes, ransacked boxes and cabinets. On Drum Tower Street alone, dozens of businesses, including the Chinese Christian Baptist Hongen Church, Sino-American Optical Company, Wufu Sauce Garden, and Jintai Hotel, were looted. Chiang Kai-shek bandits, who occupied Kaifeng Women's Normal School as a position, looted all the school's clothing before fleeing, and then set the buildings on fire. Teachers and students of the school hiding in the basement almost all perished. Teachers and students of Ji Bian Middle School were locked in a room; they were not allowed to seek shelter during the Chiang Kai-shek plane bombings, resulting in dozens of casualties. Chiang Kai-shek bandits relied on the Nationalist Party provincial government buildings for combat, and at night, in order to provide lighting by setting fires, the nearby Kaifeng Women's Normal School, Broadcasting Station, Sanyou Industrial Society, and others were all engulfed, with flames soaring into the sky. Even after ground combat had ended, bombing and strafing by American-supplied Chiang Kai-shek planes continued for days. Chiang Kai-shek bandits declared they would bomb Kaifeng to the ground to avenge their defeat. Although the PLA troops entering the city exerted all their efforts, with great self-sacrifice, to assist people from all walks of life in Kaifeng in rescuing refugees and maintaining order, it was still difficult to offset the immense losses caused by this mad act of destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The tragedy of the beautiful ancient capital of Kaifeng proves that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang cannot resist the PLA's offensive and is only fighting the people, fighting peaceful residents who have no weapons. The crime of destroying Kaifeng will be forever remembered by the people of Henan and the people of China. Blood debts must be repaid, and the murderers who created the blood debts will surely have a day when they are judged and severely punished.

　　美丽古都惨遭浩劫
    蒋匪轰炸焚掠开封
    屠杀同胞的凶手将来必予审判严办
    【新华社开封前线二十七日电】开封前线记者报导：蒋匪在开封制造了灭绝人性的血腥罪行。从本月十八日起，该城即被美国及加拿大援助蒋介石的大批轰炸机日夜轮番轰炸，被歼前的城内守敌亦疯狂纵火屠杀抢劫，大批建筑已被付之一炬，市民伤亡者刻尚无法作完全统计。仅据宋门大街同济医院二十二、二十三两天统计，因被炸前往该院疗伤者即达六百余人。此次蒋匪对开封之暴行，人民生命财产损失空前惨重，甚至连在南京的河南省伪立委们，也不得不向伪行政院长翁文灏呈递请愿书，“敦促翁氏下令政府飞机停止轰炸开封城，以保护平民”（美联社）。而伪立法院也决议“将来应避免盲目轰炸城市”（合众社）。由此可见，此次蒋介石匪帮毁灭和平居民的罪恶是如何深重，而积极援助蒋介石内战、不断供给以杀人利器的美国政府，对于这种罪恶亦应分担何等巨大的责任。
    此次战役前，蒋匪则强占城内外名胜古迹如古龙亭、鼓楼、禹王台等地及河南大学校舍、南关邮政局等处构筑工事。十八日南关敌败逃入城前，焚毁了河南大学农学院及面粉公司等建筑物，大火三日不熄。曹关敌逃入城内前，亦用煤油浇屋放火。美国供给的蒋机复在南关投掷燃烧弹，千余间民房均化为灰烬，居民死伤已知者有六十余人。十九日，解放军自南关攻入城内，蒋匪炮火仍集中轰击南关。美国供给的蒋机又投掷燃烧弹。南关大街商店、难民新村、福音堂楼房等处都被烧毁一部，焦头烂额之尸体到处可见。困守城内之敌，每遇作战不利，即行放火或由蒋机投掷燃烧弹，图以此阻遏解放军进攻。全城最繁华之中山街、马道街、鼓楼街均被纵火。南务印书馆、中西大药房、中国工业实业社建筑大都已遭焚毁。溃散之敌借口征用箱物构筑工事，登堂入室，翻箱倒柜，仅鼓楼街即有中国基督教浸礼会鸿恩堂、中美眼镜公司、五福酱园、金台旅社等数十家遭抢劫。强占开封女师作阵地之蒋匪于败逃时抢劫全校衣物后，又点火烧屋，藏身地下室的该校师生几全遭难。济汴中学师生则被关于屋内；蒋机轰炸时仍不准躲避，致伤亡数十人。蒋匪凭借国民党省府建筑作战，夜间为了放火照明，附近之开封女师，广播电台、三友实业社等均遭蔓延，火光冲天。在地面战斗结束后，美国供给的蒋机之轰炸扫射仍连日不停。蒋匪宣称将炸平开封以雪败战之恨。入城的解放军虽竭尽全力，以极大的自我牺牲精神协同开封各界人士救助难民，维护秩序，但仍难于抵消蒋匪此种疯狂毁灭行为所造成的浩大损失。美丽的古都开封的惨剧，证明蒋介石匪帮不能抵抗解放军的攻势，而只是向人民作战，向手无寸铁的和平居民作战。破坏开封的罪行，将为河南人民和中国人民所永远记住。血债必须偿还，制造血债的凶手必有被审判严办的一天。
