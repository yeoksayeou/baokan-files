　　Restoring and Developing Industrial Production in Liberated Areas
  　The North China Industrial and Commercial Conference Achieves Great Success
  　Formulating Specific Measures to Protect and Develop Industry and Commerce
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The North China Liberated Area Industrial and Commercial Conference concluded on June 27th. Based on the guiding principles of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, the conference formulated specific measures to implement the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, and reviewed shortcomings in past work. This laid the foundation for the rapid development of industry and commerce in the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji liberated areas under unified policies and specific measures. The resolutions passed by the conference have been submitted to the merged Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Governments for approval and implementation.

    The conference opened in Shijiazhuang on May 17th and lasted for forty-two days. A total of 320 delegates attended, including administrative personnel and staff from government, trade unions, and state-owned enterprises, as well as representatives from cooperatives and private industrial and commercial capitalists and laborers. Among them, there were 36 representatives from private industrial and commercial capitalists and 31 representatives from laborers. The conference was presided over by Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, and Yao Yilin, Deputy Director of the Jin-Cha-Ji Finance Office, appointed by the North China Central Bureau. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Comrade Dong Biwu, Comrade Luo Mai, Comrade Teng Daiyuan, and others all attended the conference to provide guidance. Comrade Bo Yibo of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party gave a concluding speech. He believed that such a grand conference dedicated to discussing the restoration and development of industry and commerce was the first of its kind in both border regions, and that the conference achieved great success under the guidance of Chairman Mao's and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's correct policy of protecting industry and commerce. He believed that this conference was the starting point for building industry in the North China Liberated Area.

    The conference discussed the relationship between public and private industry and commerce, labor-capital relations, industrial and commercial burdens, industrial and commercial administrative work, and correcting certain deviations in land reform that infringed upon industry and commerce. The conference also specifically discussed issues such as business management, wage systems, and worker welfare in state-owned enterprises. On these issues, the conference established correct guidelines and specific implementation measures.

    Regarding the relationship between public and private industry and commerce, the conference pointed out that both public and private industries need to be greatly developed. Except for the munitions industry, all industries can be freely operated by private individuals. State-owned industries should systematically supply private industries with machinery, raw materials, and power to help them develop. The conference stipulated that the task of state-owned commerce is to support production, stabilize prices, and ensure that private commerce and cooperatives are profitable through correct pricing policies, while opposing speculation and manipulation. Regarding labor-capital relations, the conference criticized the errors in some areas in the past, which failed to deeply understand the overall guideline of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, and set excessively high labor conditions with a short-sighted and one-sided pursuit of so-called worker welfare. It was determined that in the future, labor and capital should have freedom of contract, recognize the original wage and working hour systems, and the original labor-capital, employer-employee, and master-apprentice relationships. Based on the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, the existing work systems and management methods should be recognized, but some necessary improvements should be made, which are indispensable. Regarding the burden on industry and commerce, the conference pointed out that industrial and commercial taxes must not hinder the development of industry and commerce, and revenue should be generated under this premise to support the war. It was stipulated that the maximum progressive rate of industrial and commercial income tax should not exceed 25% of net profit, and necessary reductions and exemptions should be made for industrial taxes to encourage industrial development. Regarding industrial and commercial administrative work, the conference stipulated that private industry and commerce, except for businesses prohibited by law, should be recognized as legal operations and protected by law as long as they are registered with the government, and no one should infringe upon them except in accordance with the law. The conference also decided to abolish the road pass system within the liberated area, abolish the privileges of exchanges to monopolize transactions, allow private individuals to establish warehouses, protect trademark rights, and simplify import and export trade procedures, in order to ensure free domestic trade and improve foreign trade management.

    Regarding the issue of state-owned enterprises, the conference sharply pointed out that the most serious shortcomings at present are poor management, the traditional supply system, the attitude of "doing the same amount of work regardless of effort," and the use of "politics," "seniority," and "poor peasant" status as criteria for personnel administration instead of technology and production development, which has resulted in production remaining at a very low level and unable to move forward. It was emphasized that management should be improved, planning and discipline strengthened, cost accounting and economic responsibility systems implemented, and enterprises should be run like enterprises. The conference severely criticized the state of disorganization and lack of discipline, and stipulated economic discipline for state-owned enterprises. The conference pointed out that the main errors in the current wage system of state-owned enterprises are egalitarianism, vulgar "mass viewpoints," and relief viewpoints. Trainee workers and unskilled workers are treated too highly, and the wage difference between technical workers and trainees and unskilled workers is too small (the highest wage for technical workers is only three to four times the lowest wage). Wage standards are not based on the workers' skills and labor enthusiasm, but "benevolently" based on the number of family members they support. The number of employees in each state-owned factory has expanded, but the wages of technical workers have been reduced. The delegates unanimously agreed that this egalitarianism is contrary to the principle of developing production, is a way to reduce production and destroy productivity, is a relief viewpoint, not a production viewpoint, is humanitarianism, not revolutionaryism, and must be resolutely corrected. It was believed that the only criterion for determining wage levels should be the degree of labor skill, that is, the degree of mastery of production technology. There is no other criterion, and wages must be clearly separated from social relief. The conference stipulated that in state-owned enterprises in newly liberated cities, the original base salary and grade of employees should be maintained. In wartime, wages should be paid according to a certain multiple of the base salary based on the cost of living index, and subsidies should be provided in the form of rations to make up for the shortfall. In the original factories in the liberated areas, preparations are also being made to gradually move towards this wage system. The conference adopted a draft wartime wage system for state-owned factories as a temporary transitional wage system for the existing factories in the North China Liberated Area. The conference also passed important resolutions such as implementing a salary system for state-owned factory staff, implementing a ten-hour workday, requiring factories to contribute 1.5% of the total wage bill as a cultural and educational fund for employees, and 2.5% of the total wage bill as an insurance fund for employees.

    Throughout the entire conference, the discussions were filled with the spirit of actively supporting the war and developing production. Representatives from all parties actively expressed their opinions. The representatives of private industrialists and businessmen were particularly active. They further understood the Chinese Communist Party's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce at the conference. They raised many opinions and requests to the government and state-owned enterprises, most of which were satisfactorily resolved. The convening of this conference in Shijiazhuang also provided considerable assistance to all the delegates who attended, because they all saw the prosperity of Shijiazhuang with their own eyes, and the increasing development of production and transportation. They recognized the great role of Chairman Mao's correct industrial and commercial policies in building the liberated areas and building a new China, and strengthened their determination and confidence in implementing the resolutions of the Industrial and Commercial Conference.

　　恢复与发展解放区工业生产
  　华北工商会议获巨大成功
  　订出保护发展工商业的各项具体办法
    【本报讯】华北解放区工商业会议已于六月二十七日闭幕。会议根据发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的指导方针，订出了实行中共中央保护与发展工商业政策的各项具体办法，并检查了过去工作中的缺点。使原晋冀鲁豫及原晋察冀两解放区的工商业获得在统一的政策与具体办法下迅速发展的基础。会议所订出的各项决议，已送呈业已合并办公的晋冀鲁豫及晋察冀两边区政府批准执行。
    会议于五月十七日在石家庄揭幕，前后历时四十二天，出席代表共三百二十人，政府、工会、公营企业的行政人员及职工、合作社和私营工商业资方和劳方都派有代表出席，其中私营工商业资方代表共三十六人，劳方代表共三十一人。会议由华北中央局指派晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席杨秀峰及晋察冀财办副主任姚依林主持，朱总司令、董必武同志、罗迈同志、滕代远同志等皆先后到会指导。会议最后由中共中央华北局薄一波同志作总结。他认为象这样隆重盛大的、专门讨论工商业恢复和发展问题的会议，在两边区都是第一次，会议在毛主席和中共中央正确保护工商业政策昭示下获得极大成功。他认为这次会议乃是建设华北解放区工业的起点。
    会议讨论了工商业政策中的公营私营工商业关系、劳资关系、工商业负担、工商行政工作及纠正土地改革中某些侵犯工商业的偏向等问题。会议并专门讨论了公营企业中的经营管理、工资制度及工人福利问题。在这些问题上，会议都规定了正确的方针与具体的实施办法。
    在公营私营工商业关系中，会议指出了公营与私营工业，都需要大大发展，除军火工业外，一切工业私人都可以自由经营，公营工业应当有计划的供给私营工业以机器原料和动力，帮助私营工业发展。会议规定了公营商业的任务，是扶助生产，稳定物价，并通过正确的物价政策，使私人商业、合作社都有利可图，反对投机操纵。在劳资关系中，会议指摘了过去有些地区，未能深刻体会发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的总方针，以近视的片面的所谓劳动者福利为目标，规定过高的劳动条件的错误。确定今后劳资双方契约自由，承认过去原有的工资、工时制度与原有的劳资、东伙与师徒关系，并根据劳资两利原则，承认旧有的工作制度和经营方法，但须加以若干的必要的改进，这是不可缺少的。对于工商业负担，会议指出工商业税必须不妨碍工商业之发展，在此前提下争取收入，支援战争。规定工商业所得税最高累进率不超过纯利的百分之二十五，并为奖励工业发展，对工业税作必要的减免。对于工商行政工作，会议规定除法律禁止之营业外，私人工商业只要向政府登记，即确认为合法经营，受法律之保护，任何人非依法律不得侵犯。会议并决定取消解放区境内路条制度，废除交易所垄断交易的特权，准许私人设立行栈，保护商标专用权，简化出入境贸易手续等具体办法，以保障内地贸易自由，改进对外贸易管理。
    关于公营企业问题，会议尖锐地指出了目前最严重的缺点是经营管理不善，供给制传统，“干不干二斤半”，用人行政不是以技术和发展生产为标准，而是以“政治”“老资格”“贫雇”等为标准等，以致生产停留在很低水准，不能前进。强调提出改善经营管理，加强计划性，纪律性，成本会计，经济责成制，实行企业化。会议严厉的批评了无组织无纪律状态，规定了公营企业经济纪律。会议指出了公营企业的现行工资制度中主要的错误是平均主义，庸俗的“群众观点”和救济观点。学徒工人与非熟练工人待遇太高，技术工人与学徒及非熟练工人之间工资的差别太小（技术工人最高工资只合最低工资的三倍到四倍），工资标准不是以工人的技术和劳动热忱为标准，而是“仁慈”的以养活其全家几口人为标准，每个公营工厂人数都扩大了，技术工人工资却减低了。到会代表一致认为这种平均主义是与发展生产的原则相违背的，这是降低生产毁灭生产力的办法，是救济观点，不是生产观点，是人道主义，不是革命主义，必须坚决改正。认为应以劳动的熟练程度，亦即掌握生产技术的熟练程度为决定工资等级的唯一标准，除此之外，再没有其他任何标准，必须把工资与社会救济截然分开。会议规定了在新解放城市公营企业中，保持职工原来的底薪，及其原来的等级，在战时，根据生活指数按底薪的一定倍数发给工资，并以配给办法补助其不足。在解放区原有的工厂中，也准备逐渐向这种工资制度看齐。会议通过了公营工厂战时工资制度草案，作为华北解放区原有的工厂目前暂行的过渡的工资制度。会议并通过了公营工厂职员实行薪金制，实行十小时工作制，工厂每月需提出相当于工资总额百分之一·五作为职工文化教育基金，相当于工资总额百分之二·五作为职工保险金等重要决议。
    在整个会议的讨论中，充满了积极支援战争和发展生产的精神。各方面的代表都积极的发表了自己的意见。其中私人工商业家的代表格外积极，他们在会议中进一步了解了中国共产党保护与发展工商业的政策，他们提出了对于政府和公营企业的许多意见和要求，大部都得到了满意的解决。此次会议在石家庄召开，对到会全体代表也有不小的帮助，因为他们都亲眼看见石家庄的繁荣，和生产与交通的日益发展，认识了毛主席的正确的工商业政策之执行，对于建设解放区，建设新中国的伟大作用，加强了他们执行工商业会议决议的决心与信心。
