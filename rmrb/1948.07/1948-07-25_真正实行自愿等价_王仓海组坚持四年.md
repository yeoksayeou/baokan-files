【Taiyue Telegram】 The mutual aid group led by Wang Canghai in Yangshu Village, Sixth District of Yangcheng, has persisted for more than four years, from 1944 to the present, and is very solid. This group is so solid because it has four advantages: (1) Voluntary participation and free withdrawal. Every year, a few people leave and join the group, but everyone always chooses Wang Canghai as the leader. During this year's mutual aid rectification, five new families joined. They all said: We have long been interested in your group; you, old man, treat people so well. This year, the group has a total of thirteen families. Their crops are always planted first in every season, and everyone says it is good. (2) The leader consults with everyone on matters, and after a decision is made, the group leader supervises the execution, without coercion or drifting along. For example, when weeding seedlings, everyone discussed the method of allocating labor. It was decided that Wang Dehua's plot was large, so ten people were assigned; Zhang Xiaomeng only had three mu, so three people were assigned. The group leader executed accordingly, and no one had any objections. (3) Work is recorded based on the type of task, and accounts are settled by season. There are two methods for recording work: one is to fix work points based on the length of labor time; the other is to flexibly calculate work points based on the amount of work done. Generally, harvesting wheat, sowing seeds, weeding seedlings, etc., are all fixed work points based on time. One day is divided into three shifts: from early morning to mealtime is one shift, from after breakfast to before lunch is one shift, and from after lunch to dark is one shift, with three shifts totaling one work point. Heavy work such as carrying manure and wheat is recorded based on the type of work. First, the distance of the land is calculated, and the number of trips that can be carried in a day is determined. Only those who carry enough trips can get full work points; those who do not carry enough cannot get full work points. Work accounts are settled every year according to the seasons of spring plowing, weeding, and wheat harvesting. On July 6, after the wheat harvesting and sowing were completed, the work accounts were immediately settled. (4) The group leader can think of everything for the members, and everyone deeply recognizes that the mutual aid group is to seek benefits for themselves. Zhang Guocai's family had difficulty eating grain, but he was embarrassed to ask. Wang Canghai saw his thoughts and said: "Our group will solve it for you." He managed to borrow four dou of grain for him. At the same time, he solved the difficulty of not having food for two other families. He himself is a military dependent and never allows the village to allocate labor to give him preferential treatment. In addition to doing his own work, he also works extra. Group member Zhang Guoxian said: "Old man Canghai, as the group leader, is diligent in speaking, diligent in walking, unselfish, and treats people well." The group members all feel that mutual aid is for themselves, and mutual aid is gradually consolidated.

　　真正实行自愿等价
  　王仓海组坚持四年
    【太岳电】阳城六区杨恕村王仓海领导的互助小组，从一九四四年到现在，坚持了四年多，非常巩固。这个组能够这么巩固，是因为有四个好处：（一）自愿参加，自由退出。每年有三三两两的人出组进组，但大家总是选王仓海当组长。今年整顿互助时，有五家又新参加了。他们都说：我们早就看中你这个组，你老汉待人就是好。该组今年共有十三家，庄稼做得季季在先，人人说好。（二）领导上有事和大家商量，决定了就由组长监督去做，不强迫命令，也不自流。如锄苗时大家讨论拨工办法，决定王德华的地块大，拨十个人；张小孟只有三亩，拨三个人；组长照着执行，谁也没有意见。（三）按活计工，按季算帐。记工办法有两种：一种按劳动时间长短固定计工；一种是按活做的多少灵活计工。一般的割麦、点种、锄苗等都是按时固定计工，一天分为三晌，清早到饭时顶一晌，早饭后到午饭前顶一晌，午饭后到天黑顶一晌，三晌共顶一工。作担粪担麦等重活是按活记工，先按地的远近，计算一天能担几回，担够回数才能顶全工，不够就不能顶全工。每年按春耕、锄苗、割麦等季节清算工帐。七月六日割麦点种完了，马上就清算了工帐。（四）组长能为组员处处设想，大家都深刻认了互助组就是为自己谋利益。张国才家里吃粮困难，但不好意思张口，王仓海看出他的心思，就说：“咱组里给你解决”。设法给他借了四斗谷子。同时解决了另外两家没吃的困难。他本人是个军属，从来不让村里拨工优待，除干了自己的活，还要长工。组员张国贤说：“仓海老汉当组长就是嘴勤、腿勤、不自私，待人好”。组员们都感到互助是为了自己，互助逐步巩固了。
