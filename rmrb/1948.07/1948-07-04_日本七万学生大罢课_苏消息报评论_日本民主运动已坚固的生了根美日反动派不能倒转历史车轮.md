　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Tokyo News: Approximately 75,000 students from 24 Japanese universities and high schools launched a major strike on the 23rd. By the 24th, the strike wave had "spread throughout Japan." By the 26th, the number of participating schools had reached 110. Striking students are protesting the government's proposed new budget, which includes a proposal to increase tuition fees. The bill is currently under discussion in the Japanese Diet. Striking students have established numerous liaison offices to explain the reasons for the strike and to discuss ways to submit petitions to the Diet. In Tokyo's main station and on the streets, students are gathering signatures from supporters in groups.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: TASS, 25th: An Izvestia analyst, commenting on the Japanese political situation, pointed out that the situation in Japan is now so tense that Japanese newspapers are predicting the imminent collapse of the Ashida Cabinet. The underlying cause of the impending government crisis is the dissatisfaction of the American reactionary groups with the Ashida government's inability to suppress the democratic movement, which has become a major obstacle to their (referring to the American reactionary groups) long-term plans. The recent intensification of the American occupation authorities' interference in Japan's domestic political struggles, as well as the arrest of the most active members of the democratic movement, are not accidental. The American authorities are encouraging the formation of a united front of Japanese reactionaries, and the so-called "Liberal Democratic Party" (Note: The "Liberal Democratic Party" was formed on March 15th of this year through the merger of Kijuro Shidehara's Democratic Party and Shigeru Yoshida's Liberal Party, a so-called "new conservative party." Shigeru Yoshida is currently the party leader, with Kijuro Shidehara as honorary advisor), is becoming the gathering center for Japanese reactionaries in the post-war period. The current political situation in Japan shows that the American occupation authorities are preparing to launch another attack on the democratic movement together with Japanese reactionaries. However, the democratic movement has taken such firm root in Japan since the defeat of Japanese militarism that neither Japanese reactionaries nor American reactionaries can reverse the wheels of Japanese history. Moreover, this would contradict the vital interests of all countries striving for peace and security in the Pacific region, making it even more impossible.

　　日本七万学生大罢课
    苏消息报评论
    日本民主运动已坚固的生了根美日反动派不能倒转历史车轮
    【新华社陕北三十日电】东京消息：二十四所日本大学及高等学校约七万五千名学生，于二十三日发动大罢课。二十四日，罢课浪潮已“遍及全日各地”，至二十六日，参加罢课的学校为数已达一百一十所。罢课学生抗议政府所提出的新预算案中关于增加学费的建议：该议案现正为日议会讨论中。罢课学生现已设立许多联络处，以解释罢课之原因及商议向议会提交请愿书之方法。在东京大车站及街道上，学生成群地征求支持者签名。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据塔斯社二十五日讯：消息报分析家于评论日本政局时指出：日本政局情况现已如此紧张，以致日本报纸正在预言芦田内阁行将垮台。迫在眉睫的政府危机的基本原因，便是美国反动集团不满芦田政府无能镇压那成为他们（指美国反动集团）长远计谋之主要障碍的民主运动。美国占领当局最近对日本国内政治斗争之加强干涉，以及逮捕民主运动的最积极分子，都不是偶然的。美国当局正鼓励成立日本反动派的联合阵线，而所谓“自由民主党”（按“自由民主党”系于本年三月十五日成立，由币原喜重郎派的民主党和吉田茂的自由党合并而组成的所谓“新保守党”。该党党魁现为吉田茂，币原当名誉顾问），则正化为战后时期日本反动派的汇集中心，日本目前的政治情况，显示美国占领当局正与日本反动派共同准备对民主运动发起另一进攻。但民主运动在日本军国主义败北之后，业已那样巩固的生了根，以致无论日本反动派或美国反动派，均不可能倒转日本的历史车轮，加之，这是与力求太平洋地区和平与安全的一切国家的切身利益相抵触的，所以就更不可能了。
