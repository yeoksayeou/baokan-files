　　Commemorating "July 1st"
    Taihang Directly Subordinate Organizations Strengthen Policy Study
    [Taihang News] The Taihang District Party Committee and various directly subordinate organizations at the administrative level held a cadre meeting of over a thousand people at the location of the Party Committee's offices on "July 1st" to solemnly commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Party's founding. Comrade Leng Chu of the District Party Committee gave a report at the meeting, pointing out that under the leadership of the Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese revolution will soon achieve victory on a national scale. He briefly described the history of the Party's 27 years of development and growth, and pointed out that everyone should carefully study and accept the Party's historical experiences and lessons, and study the line and policies, to better ensure the victorious guidance of the Chinese revolution. He then gave a detailed explanation of the three specific tasks of war, production, and Party rectification. Regarding the continued implementation of Party rectification, he said: Comrades who have performed well after rectification must be commended, and those who have been improperly punished or whose conclusions are incorrect should be corrected; those who continue to develop their mistakes should be criticized. He particularly pointed out the necessity of strengthening organization and discipline at the present time. Finally, he called on everyone: In order to welcome the arrival of national victory and to better realize the Party's current tasks, all organizations should launch an in-depth policy study movement: (1) In the study, it is necessary to determine the plan and steps for achieving improved work from the perspective of clarifying the connection between the overall task and the specific tasks of one's own department. (2) Review the results of rectification, and consolidate and develop them, to better transform oneself ideologically, organizationally, attitudinally, and in terms of work attitude. (3) It is necessary to seek improvement in working methods and overcome the bureaucracy and narrow-minded empiricism that exist in current work.
    [Another dispatch] Around "July 1st," the streets of Shijiazhuang were extremely active. Yangko teams and street plays from units such as the Workers' School, Fulun Elementary School, No. 1 Complete Primary School, No. 2 Complete Primary School, Xinkai Street Elementary School, and Peiyou Elementary School... performed one after another in the city, with gongs and drums shaking the sky, and the audience was packed.
