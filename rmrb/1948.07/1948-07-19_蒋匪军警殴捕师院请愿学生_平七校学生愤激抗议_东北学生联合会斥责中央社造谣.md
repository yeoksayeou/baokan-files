Xinhua News Agency, North China, 17th: According to Tianjin newspapers, at the end of last month, a violent incident occurred in Beiping where Kuomintang troops and police obstructed a student petition, assaulting and arresting students, which has provoked joint protests from students at seven universities in Beiping. Over a thousand students from Beiping Teachers College, in order to demand that Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education fulfill its promise to allow the college to be restored to university status, set off for Nanjing on the morning of June 29th to petition. They were driven back to the college by police, pre-arranged by the Chiang government, and eleven students were injured by thrown stones. A student from the Journalism Department of Yenching University, who entered the college to report on the incident, was also arrested. The student unions of Beiping University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Chaoyang University, and other seven universities jointly issued a declaration on June 30th, protesting the persecution by the Chiang government and expressing full support for the Teachers College's "Restore University Movement."

It is reported that the predecessor of Beiping Teachers College was Beiping Normal University, which was the highest normal education institution in the country before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1937, the university moved to southern Shaanxi due to the war. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education reduced the scale of the university and renamed it Teachers College. The following year, it was renamed Northwest Teachers College and moved to Lanzhou. After the Japanese surrender, the Chiang government attempted to abolish the university, but after the students and faculty of the college strongly protested, it was forced to establish Beiping Teachers College in Beiping to accommodate the returning faculty and students. Last year, during the student movement against hunger and civil war in the Chiang-controlled areas in May and June, the students of the college put forward the demand for "restoring the university." Zhu Jiahua, then Minister of Education of Chiang Kai-shek, promised in Beiping at the time that the college would be allowed to restore its university status after one year, and that the college would first establish three departments: Literature, Science, and Education (according to the Chiang government's "University Law," only institutions with three or more colleges can be called a university, otherwise they can only be called independent colleges). Now the college has completed the establishment of the university on schedule, but Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education has broken its promise and delayed its recognition. Yuan Dunli, the president of the college, has been negotiating in Nanjing for more than two months without any results. The students of the college therefore began a strike on June 20th and decided to go to Nanjing to petition.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: After the Chiang and Fu bandit gangs created the "July 5th Massacre" in Beiping, they surrounded various schools for days, arbitrarily beating and threatening teachers and students. According to continuous reports from the Associated Press, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University have been surrounded by police and "anti-communist vanguards," groups recognized by students as official puppets, since the 12th. All pedestrians entering and leaving were subjected to unreasonable inspections. On the same day, two Yenching University students and a Tsinghua University student and a physical education teacher were beaten while riding bicycles out of Tsinghua. On the 13th, five or six hundred "anti-communist vanguards" broke into Tsinghua University and wantonly made trouble for several hours before leaving. The students of the university have asked President Mei Yiqi to take steps to protect the safety of teachers and students.

According to a dispatch from the Associated Press in Beiping: The Northeast Students' Federation issued a written statement on the 12th, condemning the Central News Agency for spreading rumors. It stated that it was "extremely angry" at the Central News Agency's Beiping dispatch on the 9th, which falsely claimed in the name of Northeast student representatives that the thousands of Northeast students who participated in the July 9th anti-slaughter demonstration "had no intention of participating in the parade," and denounced it as a conspiracy to split student unity, and stated that it would file a lawsuit against it.

　　蒋匪军警殴捕师院请愿学生
    平七校学生愤激抗议
    东北学生联合会斥责中央社造谣
    【新华社华北十七日电】据天津报纸消息：上月底北平曾发生国民党军警阻挠学生请愿殴捕学生的暴行，并已激起平市七校学生联合抗议。缘北平师范学院学生千余人，为要求蒋记教育部实践诺言，允许该院恢复为大学建制，乃于六月二十九日晨出发前往南京请愿，被蒋政府预先布置的警察驱回校内，并以石子击伤学生十一人。燕大新闻系学生一人进入该院采访，亦横遭逮捕。平市北大、清华、燕京、朝阳等七校学生自治会为此于六月三十日联合发表宣言，抗议蒋政府迫害，并表示全力支援师院“复大运动”。
    按：北平师院前身为北平师范大学，系抗战前全国最高师范教育机构。一九三七年该校因战事迁陕南，三八年蒋记教育部缩小该校规模，并改名为师范学院，次年又改称为西北师范学院迁往兰州。日本投降后，蒋政府企图取消该大学，后在该院师生力争下，始被迫在平设立北平师院，收容该校返平师生。去年五六月间蒋区学生掀起反饥饿、反内战运动时，该校学生提出“复大”要求，蒋记教育部长朱家骅当时在平答应一年后准予该校复大，先由该院成立文学、理学、教育三部（按蒋政府“大学法”规定，具备三个学院以上者始得称为大学，否则仅得称为独立学院）。现该院已按期完成大学建制，而蒋记教育部竟自食诺言，拖延不予承认，该院院长袁敦礼为此在南京交涉两月余亦无结果。该校学生因此于六月二十日开始罢课，并决定赴南京请愿。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋、傅匪帮在北平制造“七、五惨案”后，复连日包围各校随意殴打、威胁各校师生。据美联社连日报导：北大、清华、燕京三校校内，从十二日起即被警察及被学生公认为官方御用团体的“反共先锋队”所包围，一切行人出入均被无理检查。当日燕大学生二人，清华学生及体育教员各一人乘自行车出清华时即横遭殴打。十三日“反共先锋队”五、六百人竟冲入清华校内，肆意捣乱数小时始离去。该校学生已要求校长梅贻琦采取步骤保障师生安全。
    另据美联社北平讯：东北学生联合会于十二日发表书面声明斥责中央社造谣，对中央社北平九日电中假冒东北学生代表名义诬蔑参加七·九反屠杀示威的数千东北学生“原无参加游行之意图”一节，表示“极为愤怒”，斥之为分裂学生团结的阴谋，并表示将对此提出诉讼。
