Communist Party Member Xiang Tishui (from Shili Village), a labor hero in Huguan County, Taihang, has never relaxed in terms of thought, action, personal production, or village-wide production this year. Even during the most intense period of Party rectification and democracy, he persisted in production, publicized Party policies, helped the masses and other village cadres resolve confused ideas, and encouraged them to work hard in production. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, when county and district cadres went to meetings to study, Tishui estimated that the land reform movement would begin soon, but he did not wait passively. He immediately discussed with branch cadre Xiang Youshun: "Let's cadres and Party members take the lead and deliver the manure quickly. Once the movement starts, we won't have time to deliver it, lest it delay planting." After speaking, he led his team to deliver manure to the fields, while mobilizing other teams to do the same. Many people did not understand the Land Law and were afraid of delivering manure for nothing, so they were unwilling to move forward. Tishui said: "Everyone should quickly deliver manure to the fields they should. Manure cannot be divided equally; even if a very small number of fields are subject to adjustments, manure money and wages must be paid. In a few days, when the district cadres come back and start the movement, it will delay production, and everyone will suffer.‚Äù The masses agreed with his statement, and he led everyone in discussing and formulating a plan to deliver all the manure by the 13th day of the first lunar month. Then, he organized Party members and cadres to take the lead, and the whole village took action. A few middle peasants still had concerns, but they also followed everyone to deliver the manure. More than 40 households delivered manure at night with torches when the ground was frozen because the roads were muddy during the day. As a result, all kinds of manure, including sheep, donkey, and dregs, were delivered to the fields in nine days.

After the county and district cadres returned from the meeting, the work team went to Shili Village to carry out land reform and Party rectification. At the beginning, only one branch meeting was held, and the Party members and cadres were kicked aside and ignored. However, Tishui did not collapse because of this. He said to village chief Xiang Huaixing: "This time is different from usual. We should focus on mobilizing the poor peasants and farm laborers. Let's deliver the food to their homes for them (the work team). If we mobilize the masses, we can follow the mass line well in the future." In order to minimize the delay in production caused by Party rectification, Tishui arranged the production of his team in advance, with Xiang Laixing responsible for agriculture and Xiang Songkui and others responsible for sideline production (especially transportation). During the Party rectification, the team's agricultural and sideline production did not stop. The transportation team ran to Lin County nine times, earning 310,000 Jiao. His wife did not understand the significance of Party rectification and thought she would be criticized, saying: "I'm afraid we won't be able to feed this mule well." Tishui said: "Revolution is about making the people rich, not making us poor. How could this happen? Party rectification is for improvement." He persuaded her, and she wove ten bolts of cloth during the Party rectification period.

Tishui was not only responsible for his family and team's production but also cared about the entire village. When the Party rectification began, the cadres and masses of the Third Brigade stopped production, and the livestock had not moved for seven days. Tishui said to Ma You, who was in charge of production: "You have nine carts and seven donkeys. If you calculate it by hauling coal, you can haul it three times in seven days. Just counting the nine carts, you will haul 8,000 jin less. If you calculate one jin at nine yuan, you will earn 72,000 yuan less. The livestock at home still need to be fed." The Third Brigade listened to him and resumed transportation. The Second Brigade saw that others were doing well and followed suit.

When the village classified classes, the masses were very confused. It was also the time for planting, and more than 300 sheep were not trampling the manure in the sheepfold. Tishui said: "The struggle is against feudal exploitation, not against us. I'm not afraid. If no one is trampling, I will." This stabilized everyone's minds. Xiao Qin, on the other hand, was a new middle peasant who was waiting to divide things. His family lacked manure, so he did not trample the manure in the sheepfold. Tishui said to him: "No matter what, we have to plant. To plant, we have to apply manure. If it's a gully, applying manure will fill it up; if it's not a gully, it won't fill up without applying it. What are you waiting for? If you don't apply manure, you won't harvest grain, and you will starve yourself." Xiao Qin became sober and trampled manure for more than ten days. Some people were afraid of having their land taken away, so they were uneasy and had no intention of producing. Tishui combined the situation in his village to publicize the Party's policies, saying: "There are not many households with less land or more land in our village. The amount of land taken or given will not be much. It will be one or two mu taken or given. Don't delay the majority because of the minority."

During the Party rectification, some Party members and cadres were very afraid because they had made some mistakes. Some who had made big mistakes thought of committing suicide. Tishui said: "Not to mention that we haven't committed a capital crime; even if my crime is so serious that I should die, I should let the Party execute me. It is beneficial to the Party to execute me. People will say that the Communist Party speaks the truth and does not want bad people. If you commit suicide, even if there was no problem originally, it will become a problem." He also said: "If we make mistakes in our work, it's like accidentally hitting the seedlings with a hoe. Just be careful not to hit them in the future. It's wrong to stop moving because you are afraid of breaking the hoe." Therefore, he persisted in leading production during the Party rectification period. When the transportation team returned, he helped to calculate the accounts; when the transportation team left, he tried to buy it back for the next transportation. He also took time to work in the fields.

He himself naturally had mistakes and shortcomings in his work. For example, he had lost his temper with the masses (mostly for work), and sometimes his work methods were rigid and inflexible. During the Party rectification, some people exaggerated these shortcomings or made comments that did not match the facts when they were making comments on Party members. Even some comrades in the work team said: "During the Party rectification, you were not at the hero meeting in Nanweiquan (1944) eating well, right?" (Editor's note: Such sarcastic remarks to Party members are wrong and violate the Party rectification policy and should be corrected.) Tishui was very angry at the time and thought: "At that time, the Party and the masses cultivated me. Today, they are here to educate me and let me correct my mistakes. Why do they say that?" So he was determined to only do and not speak in the future, which was of course wrong. But after education, he quickly figured it out again. He said: "It's not easy for the Party to cultivate us. If I have some experience and don't speak up, who will do the work?" From his actions, he had carefully paid attention to his work style and attitude. For example, the mess hall of the Second Team reflected: "Tishui's attitude has become better."

In terms of personal production, he worked as hard this year as he did in previous years. He applied more fertilizer than last year. He planted about twelve mu of autumn land. Last year, he applied 1,270 loads of manure, and this year he reached 1,450 loads, plus 400 loads of top dressing during the recent weeding, totaling more than 150 loads per mu. His example promoted the whole village to prepare 12,000 loads of top dressing. 2,400 loads have already been applied. Golden Queen and Tu Yujiao are ready to be weeded three times. After the land reform and Party rectification were over, Tishui immediately called on the masses of all classes in the village to work hard in production, putting forward the slogan of increasing production by three sheng per mu. He asked landlords and rich peasants to follow the peasants in labor and production, poor peasants and farm laborers should no longer wait to divide the fruits, and middle peasants should no longer be afraid of struggle. He stated that the Communist Party will resolutely guarantee labor to get rich. He himself first bought a female donkey to develop livestock. The general mood of everyone's production is also very good.

Party members and cadres in various places should learn the following points from Xiang Tishui: 1. Resolutely believe in the Party and be loyal to the interests of the Party and the people. Believe that the Party will not abandon any Party member who can be reformed, and believe that the Party's policies and calls (such as Party rectification, land adjustment, and production) are for the benefit of the people. Resolutely correct all mistakes, and never harm the Party at any time due to personal problems (such as being emotional or collapsing). 2. When the Party calls, do it yourself first and lead the masses with action. In delivering manure and other production, Xiang Tishui has consistently demonstrated this exemplary spirit. 3. In work, link the Party's policies with the people's vital interests to persuade and improve the masses. When persuading each person, Xiang Tishui did not simply apply a set of dogmas but inspired them to accept the Party's call from their own interests. This working method can enable us to lead the broad masses to act together and never fall into isolation or failure.
