Communist Party Member Xiang Tishui (from Shili Village), a labor hero in Huguan County, Taihang, has never relaxed in terms of thought, action, personal production, or village-wide production this year. Even during the most intense period of Party rectification and democracy, he persisted in production, publicized Party policies, helped the masses and other village cadres resolve confused ideas, and encouraged them to work hard in production. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, when county and district cadres went to meetings to study, Tishui estimated that the land reform movement would begin soon, but he did not wait passively. He immediately discussed with branch cadre Xiang Youshun: "Let's cadres and Party members take the lead and deliver the manure quickly. Once the movement starts, we won't have time to deliver it, lest it delay planting." After speaking, he led his team to deliver manure to the fields, while mobilizing other teams to do the same. Many people did not understand the Land Law and were afraid of delivering manure for nothing, so they were unwilling to move forward. Tishui said: "Everyone should quickly deliver manure to the fields they should. Manure cannot be divided equally; even if a very small number of fields are subject to adjustments, manure money and wages must be paid. In a few days, when the district cadres come back and start the movement, it will delay production, and everyone will suffer.” The masses agreed with his statement, and he led everyone in discussing and formulating a plan to deliver all the manure by the 13th day of the first lunar month. Then, he organized Party members and cadres to take the lead, and the whole village took action. A few middle peasants still had concerns, but they also followed everyone to deliver the manure. More than 40 households delivered manure at night with torches when the ground was frozen because the roads were muddy during the day. As a result, all kinds of manure, including sheep, donkey, and dregs, were delivered to the fields in nine days.

After the county and district cadres returned from the meeting, the work team went to Shili Village to carry out land reform and Party rectification. At the beginning, only one branch meeting was held, and the Party members and cadres were kicked aside and ignored. However, Tishui did not collapse because of this. He said to village chief Xiang Huaixing: "This time is different from usual. We should focus on mobilizing the poor peasants and farm laborers. Let's deliver the food to their homes for them (the work team). If we mobilize the masses, we can follow the mass line well in the future." In order to minimize the delay in production caused by Party rectification, Tishui arranged the production of his team in advance, with Xiang Laixing responsible for agriculture and Xiang Songkui and others responsible for sideline production (especially transportation). During the Party rectification, the team's agricultural and sideline production did not stop. The transportation team ran to Lin County nine times, earning 310,000 Jiao. His wife did not understand the significance of Party rectification and thought she would be criticized, saying: "I'm afraid we won't be able to feed this mule well." Tishui said: "Revolution is about making the people rich, not making us poor. How could this happen? Party rectification is for improvement." He persuaded her, and she wove ten bolts of cloth during the Party rectification period.

Tishui was not only responsible for his family and team's production but also cared about the entire village. When the Party rectification began, the cadres and masses of the Third Brigade stopped production, and the livestock had not moved for seven days. Tishui said to Ma You, who was in charge of production: "You have nine carts and seven donkeys. If you calculate it by hauling coal, you can haul it three times in seven days. Just counting the nine carts, you will haul 8,000 jin less. If you calculate one jin at nine yuan, you will earn 72,000 yuan less. The livestock at home still need to be fed." The Third Brigade listened to him and resumed transportation. The Second Brigade saw that others were doing well and followed suit.

When the village classified classes, the masses were very confused. It was also the time for planting, and more than 300 sheep were not trampling the manure in the sheepfold. Tishui said: "The struggle is against feudal exploitation, not against us. I'm not afraid. If no one is trampling, I will." This stabilized everyone's minds. Xiao Qin, on the other hand, was a new middle peasant who was waiting to divide things. His family lacked manure, so he did not trample the manure in the sheepfold. Tishui said to him: "No matter what, we have to plant. To plant, we have to apply manure. If it's a gully, applying manure will fill it up; if it's not a gully, it won't fill up without applying it. What are you waiting for? If you don't apply manure, you won't harvest grain, and you will starve yourself." Xiao Qin became sober and trampled manure for more than ten days. Some people were afraid of having their land taken away, so they were uneasy and had no intention of producing. Tishui combined the situation in his village to publicize the Party's policies, saying: "There are not many households with less land or more land in our village. The amount of land taken or given will not be much. It will be one or two mu taken or given. Don't delay the majority because of the minority."

During the Party rectification, some Party members and cadres were very afraid because they had made some mistakes. Some who had made big mistakes thought of committing suicide. Tishui said: "Not to mention that we haven't committed a capital crime; even if my crime is so serious that I should die, I should let the Party execute me. It is beneficial to the Party to execute me. People will say that the Communist Party speaks the truth and does not want bad people. If you commit suicide, even if there was no problem originally, it will become a problem." He also said: "If we make mistakes in our work, it's like accidentally hitting the seedlings with a hoe. Just be careful not to hit them in the future. It's wrong to stop moving because you are afraid of breaking the hoe." Therefore, he persisted in leading production during the Party rectification period. When the transportation team returned, he helped to calculate the accounts; when the transportation team left, he tried to buy it back for the next transportation. He also took time to work in the fields.

He himself naturally had mistakes and shortcomings in his work. For example, he had lost his temper with the masses (mostly for work), and sometimes his work methods were rigid and inflexible. During the Party rectification, some people exaggerated these shortcomings or made comments that did not match the facts when they were making comments on Party members. Even some comrades in the work team said: "During the Party rectification, you were not at the hero meeting in Nanweiquan (1944) eating well, right?" (Editor's note: Such sarcastic remarks to Party members are wrong and violate the Party rectification policy and should be corrected.) Tishui was very angry at the time and thought: "At that time, the Party and the masses cultivated me. Today, they are here to educate me and let me correct my mistakes. Why do they say that?" So he was determined to only do and not speak in the future, which was of course wrong. But after education, he quickly figured it out again. He said: "It's not easy for the Party to cultivate us. If I have some experience and don't speak up, who will do the work?" From his actions, he had carefully paid attention to his work style and attitude. For example, the mess hall of the Second Team reflected: "Tishui's attitude has become better."

In terms of personal production, he worked as hard this year as he did in previous years. He applied more fertilizer than last year. He planted about twelve mu of autumn land. Last year, he applied 1,270 loads of manure, and this year he reached 1,450 loads, plus 400 loads of top dressing during the recent weeding, totaling more than 150 loads per mu. His example promoted the whole village to prepare 12,000 loads of top dressing. 2,400 loads have already been applied. Golden Queen and Tu Yujiao are ready to be weeded three times. After the land reform and Party rectification were over, Tishui immediately called on the masses of all classes in the village to work hard in production, putting forward the slogan of increasing production by three sheng per mu. He asked landlords and rich peasants to follow the peasants in labor and production, poor peasants and farm laborers should no longer wait to divide the fruits, and middle peasants should no longer be afraid of struggle. He stated that the Communist Party will resolutely guarantee labor to get rich. He himself first bought a female donkey to develop livestock. The general mood of everyone's production is also very good.

Party members and cadres in various places should learn the following points from Xiang Tishui: 1. Resolutely believe in the Party and be loyal to the interests of the Party and the people. Believe that the Party will not abandon any Party member who can be reformed, and believe that the Party's policies and calls (such as Party rectification, land adjustment, and production) are for the benefit of the people. Resolutely correct all mistakes, and never harm the Party at any time due to personal problems (such as being emotional or collapsing). 2. When the Party calls, do it yourself first and lead the masses with action. In delivering manure and other production, Xiang Tishui has consistently demonstrated this exemplary spirit. 3. In work, link the Party's policies with the people's vital interests to persuade and improve the masses. When persuading each person, Xiang Tishui did not simply apply a set of dogmas but inspired them to accept the Party's call from their own interests. This working method can enable us to lead the broad masses to act together and never fall into isolation or failure.

### 共产党员向提水领导生产不放松

　　共产党员向提水领导生产不放松
    太行壶关县头名劳动英雄共产党员向提水（十里村人），在今年生产中，无论思想上、行动上、对个人生产或对全村生产，都一直没有放松过。就是在整党民主最紧张的时候，他也仍在坚持生产，并宣传党的政策，帮助群众与其他村干解决糊涂思想，鼓励他们努力生产。土地法大纲颁布后，县区干部都开会学习去了，提水估计土改运动很快就要开始，但他并不消极等待，马上和支干向有顺商量：“咱们干部党员们赶快带起头来，把粪送了吧。闹开运动就没工夫送了，防备误了种地。”说罢，就带领自己的一队开始往地送粪，同时动员其他队群众也来送。许多群众对土地法摸不着底细，都怕白送了，不肯往前走。提水说：“大家该往哪块地送就赶快送吧，粪平分不了；就是抽补很少数地了，也得打粪钱和工资哩。不几天区干部回来一闹运动，耽误了生产，可是自己吃亏。”群众同意他的说法，他便领导大家讨论订出阴历正月初四到十三十天送完粪的计划。接着组织党员干部带头进行，全村便都行动起来。有少数中农思想仍有顾虑，但也跟着大家把粪送了。有四十多户因白天路泥，趁夜里地结着冰的时候点火把送。结果九天就把全村所有羊、驴、渣各种粪全部送到地里。
    县区干部开会回来，工作组到十里村进行土改与整党。开始只开了一次支部会，对党员干部就一脚踢开不理了。但提水没有因此而躺倒，他对村长向怀兴说：“这次不比往常，主要深入发动贫雇，咱把饭给他们（工作组）派到贫雇家吧。把群众发动起来，咱们以后也好好走群众路线。”提水为使整党少耽误生产，事先就把本队的生产具体安排好，农业由向来兴负责，副业（特别是运输）由向松魁等负责。整党中全队农副业生产就没停顿。运输队到林县跑了九次，赚冀钞三十一万元。他媳妇不了解整党意义，以为要挨斗争，说：“咱这骡子恐怕也喂不好了。”提水说：“革命是革的叫老百姓富哩，不是叫咱穷哩，哪会有这事？整党是为整好。”他说服了她，她在整党期间织了十丈布。
    提水不但对自己家里和本队生产负责，对全村也同样关心。整党开始，三大队的干部和群众都停止了生产，牲口有七天没走动。提水对领导生产的马有说：“你们九辆车，七头驴，按拉煤算，七天能拉三次，光九辆车算下来就少拉八千斤。一斤按九元算，也少赚七万二。牲口在家还要算草料。”三大队听了他的话，又重新运输开了。二大队见人家干得红，跟着也干起来了。
    村里划阶级时，群众非常混乱。又正是种地时候，有三百多只羊没人踏圈。提水说：“斗争是斗封建剥削哩，不是斗圪堆堆哩，我不害怕。没人卧我卧。”这样大家的心才算开始安定下来，小秦则是新中农，等着想分东西，家里缺粪，也不踏圈卧羊。提水对他说：“不管怎样也得种地，种地就得上粪。是圪道的，卧上粪也要填；不是圪道的，不卧也填不上。等着干甚？不上粪，打不下粮食，是自己饿肚哩。”小秦则清醒了，踏了十几天粪。有些群众因怕抽动自己土地，惶惶不安，没心思生产，提水就结合本村情况宣传党的政策说：“咱村少地多地的户都不多，抽补也抽补不了多少，抽也是一亩二亩，补也是一亩二亩，不要因这少数耽误了多数。”
    整党中，有的党员干部因为犯过些错误，心里很害怕，个别错误大的想到要寻死。提水说：“不用说咱还没犯了死罪；就是我罪大该死，也要叫党枪毙我，枪毙了我对党有利。人家会说共产党说真理，不要坏人。要自己寻了死，本来没问题也成了有问题。”又说：“咱们做工作犯了错，就和锄苗碰坏了锄一样，以后小心不要碰就对啦。怕坏了锄就不动弹是不对的。”因此他在整党期间仍坚持领导生产。运输队回来了，他就帮助算帐；运输队走了，就想法买下来，供再次运输。还抽空下地工作。
    他自己在工作中自然也是有错误、有缺点的。比如对群众也发过脾气（多半是为了工作），有时工作方式生硬不灵活等。整党中，有少数人在对党员提意见时，把他这些缺点夸大起来，或提得与事实不符。甚至有的工作组同志也说：“整党没有你在南委泉开英雄会（四四年）端着吃好吧？”（编者按：这样讽刺党员的话，是不对的，是违背整党方针的，应改正。）提水当时很恼，心想：“那时候是党和群众培养我，今天是来教育我，让我来改正错误，为什么这样说呢？”所以曾下定决心，以后光做不说，这当然是不对的。但经过教育，很快又想通了。他说：“党培养咱也不是容易的。自己有了些经验，有意见不说，工作叫谁干？”从行动中看，他对自己的作风与态度已细心注意起来。如二队饭场上反映：“提水态度变得好啦。”
    个人生产上，今年干得与往年一样有劲。施肥比去年更多。他种秋地约十二亩，去年上粪一千二百七十担，今年达到一千四百五十担，加上最近锄苗中上追肥四百担，每亩合计一百五十多担。他的榜样推动着全村，共准备上追肥一万二千担。现已上了二千四百担。金皇后和土玉茭准备普锄三遍。土改与整党结束后，提水马上号召全村各阶层群众努力生产，提出每亩增产三升的口号。他要求地主富农跟着农民劳动生产，贫雇农不要再等待分果实，中农也不要再怕斗争了。说明劳动致富，共产党一定坚决保障。他自己先买了一头牝驴，准备发展牲畜。大家生产情绪一般也很好。
    各地党员干部应该从向提水学习以下几点：一、坚决相信党，忠实于党与人民的利益。相信党不会遗弃任何可以改造的党员，相信党的政策与号召（如整党、抽补与生产）是为着人民的利益。坚决改正一切错误，在任何时候不因个人问题（如闹情绪、躺倒）而损害党。二、党有号召，自己先做，以行动带领群众。在送粪与其他生产中，向提水都贯穿了这种模范精神。三、工作中把党的政策和群众切身利害联系起来，说服与提高群众。向提水在说服每个群众时，都不是硬搬教条的一套，而是从群众自身利害上启发其接受党的号召。这种工作方法可以使我们带起广大群众共同行动，永不陷于孤立或失败。
