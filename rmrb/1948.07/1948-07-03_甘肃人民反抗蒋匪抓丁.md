Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, July 27th: Under the influence of the victorious advance of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, incidents of the people of Gansu resisting the Chiang bandit's conscription tyranny are increasing daily. The Chiang authorities are conscripting soldiers in various counties of Gansu Province with extreme urgency. Qingshui is a third-class small county with a population of less than 100,000, and more than 700 conscripts were seized in February and March of this year alone. After Ma Bufang's Qinghai Hui army suffered heavy casualties at the hands of our army in Heshui last year, they rampantly conscripted soldiers in Ningding, Hezheng, Yongjing and other counties in December. In February of this year, Ma Hongkui's Ningxia Hui army dispatched a battalion of soldiers to Lintao County and seized 600 people, causing the local young and strong men to flee in droves, hiding in the mountains during the day and not daring to return home at night. As conscription becomes increasingly difficult, the Chiang authorities are forcing the people to pay to hire "conscripts." The price of hiring soldiers in Gansu is extremely high. In Hezheng, Ningding, Yongjing and other counties, the price of a conscript is at least 500 silver dollars, and in some cases as much as 1,000 silver dollars. In Guyuan County, one conscript costs 18 shi of wheat, which, at the local price of 400,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per dou, amounts to more than 70 million yuan, which is forcibly apportioned to the people. The people in the Chiang-controlled areas of Gansu are unable to bear the conscription and extortion, and spontaneous resistance incidents continue to occur. For example, in Ningding, a young man stabbed the head of the Jia twice and fled in order to resist conscription. A Kuomintang-appointed Bao chief of the Chenjiahe Xian Township Office in Jingning County took several Bao soldiers to Duanjiaping at night to conscript soldiers. Two brothers who made a living selling oil encountered the Bao chief's conscription on their way home. During their resistance to the arrest, they injured the Bao chief with machetes and fled. An evil bully in Hezheng County, who had worked under Ma Bufang, used conscription as an excuse to extort money everywhere, which was deeply hated by the local people. He was eventually killed by a shoemaker. In the struggle against the counter-revolutionary tyranny of Chiang and Ma, the people of Gansu are becoming increasingly aware. The people of Guyuan are circulating such a ballad: "I would rather be a member of the Eighth Route Army than a soldier of the Ma family. If I become a soldier of the Ma family, I will defect to the Eighth Route Army." They eagerly hope that the People's Liberation Army will go to rescue them as soon as possible.

　　甘肃人民反抗蒋匪抓丁
    【新华社西北二十七日电】在西北人民解放军胜利进军影响之下，甘肃人民反抗蒋匪抓丁暴政事件日多。蒋当局在甘肃省各县抓丁急如星火。清水是一个三等小县，人口不到十万，今年二、三两月即被抓去壮丁七百余名。青海回军马步芳部去年在合水遭我军重大杀伤后，十二月曾在宁定、和政、永靖等县大肆抓丁。今年二月宁夏回军马鸿逵部派兵一营在临洮县抓了六百名，致该地青壮年都纷纷逃跑，白天躲在山里，晚上也不敢回家。蒋当局以抓丁日趋困难，复强迫人民出款雇买“壮丁”。现甘肃雇兵价格极高，和政、宁定、永靖等县一名壮丁要价少者五百白洋，多的甚至一千白洋。固原县一丁索价十八石小麦，以当地价格每斗合蒋币四十万计算，则达七千多万，强迫摊派给人民负担。甘肃蒋区各地人民不堪抓丁和勒索压榨，自发反抗事件不断发生。如宁定一青年为反抓丁，把甲长戳了两刀后逃走。靖宁县陈家壑岘乡公所蒋记保长，黑夜带着几名保丁到段家坪去抓丁，有贩油为生的兄弟两人，归途遇着保长抓丁，拒捕中用马刀将保长砍伤后逃跑。和政县一曾在马步芳手下干事的恶霸到处借抓丁进行勒索，深为当地人民痛恨，终被一鞋匠将其杀死。甘肃人民在反抗蒋马反革命暴虐统治斗争中，觉悟性日益提高。固原人民流传着这样的歌谣：“愿当八路军，不当马家兵，若当马家兵，投奔八路军。”热望人民解放军早日前往解救他们。
