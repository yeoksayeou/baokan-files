　　Joint Directive from the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee:
  　Strengthening Substitute Farming for Military Dependents and Organizing Military Dependents' Production
    [Our Newspaper] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee jointly issued a directive to governments at all levels on the 16th: "Strengthening substitute farming for military dependents and organizing military dependents' production." The directive stated:

    According to materials reflected from various regions, although individual areas or villages have done relatively well in the work of substitute farming for military dependents and organizing military dependents' production, generally speaking, it is very poor. This is mainly manifested in the village cadres' passive unwillingness to act and certain phenomena of extreme democratization. The management of substitute farming for military dependents is not good; it is not regular or there is no one to manage it, resulting in the cultivation of military dependents' land being rough and not timely, with very little fertilization, or even no fertilizer available. If we do not overcome these shortcomings immediately, the yield of military dependents' land this year will inevitably be reduced, which will not only be a great loss to production, but also extremely detrimental to solving the livelihood of military dependents and stabilizing the morale of the soldiers at the front. Therefore, we require leading cadres at all levels to conduct in-depth self-criticism and immediately carry out the following tasks:

    1. Strengthen the leadership of military dependents' production work, and specifically organize all possible labor forces of military dependents to fully invest in the production front. If it is still insufficient and they are unable to hire people to cultivate, good substitute farming should be provided. The production problems of poor military dependents who need loans should be solved first, under the same conditions as ordinary farmers, and attention should be paid to organizing semi-able-bodied military dependents to engage in sideline production to increase their income.

    2. In order to ensure that the yield of military dependents' land is not lower than the production level of ordinary farmers in the area, all localities should immediately use various methods to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer for military dependents. For land where autumn crops have been planted but fertilization is too little or has not been applied, topdressing should be applied immediately, and fertilizer should be stored to solve the needs for wheat planting after autumn.

    3. Introduce and exchange experiences in organizing military dependents' production and substitute farming. Each region should, in a planned and focused manner, collect and study methods for organizing military dependents' production and solving substitute farming problems in their own region, and conduct preliminary research and analysis (explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each method, which types of regions or villages are suitable, and suggestions for improvement, etc.). Introduce them to each village for reference and adoption. This material (especially the methods for substitute farming problems) must be sorted out and reported to the government for research, introduction, and promotion.

    Leading cadres at all levels must attach importance to this work in ideological leadership, solve the difficulties in military dependents' production from various aspects, and increase the income of military dependents so that the lives of military dependents in rural areas can reach the living standards of ordinary farmers in the area. This is one of the important contents of our this year's great production movement, implementing the policy of preferential treatment for military personnel, and consolidating the support of the troops for the war.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府
    晋察冀边区行政委员会联合指示
  　加强对军属代耕并组织军属生产
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府暨晋察冀边区行政委员会于十六日联合指示各级政府：“加强对军属的代耕与组织军属生产工作”，内称：
    据各地材料反映，目前对军属代耕与组织军属生产工作上，虽有个别地区或村庄作得较好，但普遍的说来是很差的，这主要的是表现在村干部的消极不敢做与某些极端民主化现象。对军属代耕管理不好，不经常或无人管理，以致使军属的土地耕作，粗糙不及时、施肥量很少，甚至无肥可施。这些缺点我们如不马上克服，今年军属土地的产量势必减收，不但对生产是一个很大的损失，而且对于解决军属生活安定前方战士情绪，也有极大的不利，因此要求各级领导干部应深刻检讨，并立即进行下列几项工作：
    一、加强军属生产工作的领导，具体组织军属可能组织的劳动力完全投入生产战线上去。如仍不足而又无力雇人耕种的，应很好的给予代耕。贫苦军属之需要贷款者，在与一般农民同样条件下，应注意先解决军属的生产问题，并注意组织军属半劳动力搞副业生产，增加其收入。
    二、为保证军属土地产量不低于当地一般农民的产量水平，各地应即利用各种办法，解决军属肥料不足问题。对已种的秋禾施肥太少或没有施肥的土地，应立即施用追肥，并应开始储备肥料以解决秋后种麦所需问题。
    三、介绍交流组织军属生产及代耕经验，各地区应有计划有重点的搜集研究本地区组织军属生产、解决军属代耕问题的办法，加以初步的研究分析（说明每一种办法的优点和缺点，各适合于那一类的地区或村庄改进意见等），介绍各村参考采用，此项材料（特别是代耕问题的办法）并须整理后汇报本府，以便研究介绍推广。
    各级领导干部必须在思想领导上，重视这一工作，从多方面的解决军属生产中的困难，增加军属的收入，使农村的军属生活能够达到当地一般农民的生活水平，这是我们今年结合大生产运动，贯彻优军政策，巩固部队支援战争的重要内容之一。
