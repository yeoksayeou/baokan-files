　　Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Army's Founding
    阅兵 Performed in 阿京
    Soviet and Bulgarian Military Delegations Attend to Observe
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th] TASS reports: This month's tenth day was the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Albanian army. The garrison in the capital, Tirana, held a review. Albanian Prime Minister General Hoxha, members of the Central Committee of the Albanian Communist Party, diplomatic envoys, and military delegations from the Soviet Union and Bulgaria all attended the reviewing stand to observe. Hoxha also delivered a speech, paying tribute to the people and the army. The Soviet delegation, led by Soviet Hero General Grisin, arrived in Tirana, 阿京, on the 8th at the invitation of the Albanian Ministry of Defense to attend the Albanian Army Day celebrations.
    Note: Albania is a small mountainous country on the west coast of the Balkan Peninsula, bordering Yugoslavia on the northeast and Greece on the south. It has a population of one million and an area of 28,000 square kilometers. It was occupied by Italian fascists in April 1939 and came under the direct rule of German fascists in 1943. The guerrillas organized by the Albanian people during the war numbered in the tens of thousands. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they stubbornly resisted the enemy and finally drove the invading troops out of the entire territory at the end of 1944. In 1945, a democratic provisional government was formed, headed by Communist leader Hoxha. A general election was held on February 12 of the same year, and the National Liberation Front, led by the Communist Party, won 93 percent of the vote.

　　纪念建军五周年
    阿京举行阅兵
    苏保军事使团莅临观礼
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社报导：本月十日为阿尔巴尼亚国建军五周年纪念，首都第拉那的驻军举行检阅。阿总理霍查上将、阿共中央委员、外交使节、苏联和保加利亚军事代表团，均莅检阅台观礼。霍查并发表演说，向人民及军队致敬。以苏联英雄格利辛上将为首的苏联代表团，系应阿尔巴尼亚国防部之邀，参加阿国建军节典礼，于八日抵达阿京第拉那。
    按：阿尔巴尼亚是巴尔干半岛西岸的小山国，东北两面邻南斯拉夫，南界希腊，人口一百万，面积二万八千方公里。一九三九年四月被意大利法西斯所侵占，一九四三年归德国法西斯直接统治。阿国人民在战时所组织的游击队达数万人，在共产党领导之下，顽强抗击敌人，终于一九四四年底，将全境侵略军赶走。一九四五年组成以共产党领袖霍查为首的民主临时政府。同年二月十二日举行普选，共产党领导的民族解放阵线得票百分之九十三。
