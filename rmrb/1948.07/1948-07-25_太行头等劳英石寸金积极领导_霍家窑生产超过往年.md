　　【Taihang Telegram】Under the leadership of Shi Cunjin, a top-level labor hero in the Taihang area, the production movement in Huo Jiayao Village, Licheng, has achieved significant results this year, with some areas exceeding previous years. 1945 was the best year for the production movement in the village in the decade from the end of the war against Japan to 1947, but the entire village only had sixteen head of livestock, and major agricultural tools were also lacking. This year, the number of livestock has increased to thirty-five, and the number of major agricultural tools has tripled. At the beginning of the spring plowing season this year, the masses had some misunderstandings about the Land Law, and their thinking was very confused, and their enthusiasm for production was not high. Shi Cunjin knew that everyone was afraid of disrupting the equal distribution, so he bought more than five mu of land, exchanged his donkey for two good mules, and repaired agricultural tools to motivate the masses. At the same time, he actively publicized and explained the party's policy to the masses, saying: "The district party committee has announced that land reform in our district has been basically completed and will no longer be equally distributed. From now on, the focus of work should be shifted from land reform to production." This eliminated the masses' ideological concerns, and they all said, "Let's produce well! Would the old hero still be willing to buy land if we were dividing it equally?" The spring plowing movement then began. More than thirty loads of fertilizer were applied per mu of autumn land. The land was plowed and harrowed once each, and the land for planting Jin Huanghou (a crop variety) was plowed and harrowed twice each, with up to forty loads of manure applied per mu. Both the amount of fertilizer and the number of plowing and harrowing times exceeded previous years. The village is always prepared to support the front line and prevent spring drought. Shi Cunjin proposed: "After the intercalary month, we will farm as soon as the race is over, plant as quickly as possible, and guard against spring drought." He took the lead in promoting the entire village to plant early, and also led everyone to reclaim wasteland and plant sixteen mu of hemp. As of the beginning of this month, all the village's valley land has been weeded twice, cotton has been weeded three times, and corn has been weeded twice, with topdressing fertilizer applied. During seedling pulling and weeding, the village implemented technical guidance. At the beginning, Shi Cunjin convened a technical committee to study weeding techniques, showed everyone the seedlings he had pulled from his 811 valley, and experimented with using Yangtao root and tobacco stems to boil water to treat cotton oil drought (pests), promoting the entire village to treat oil drought. When weeding seedlings, the experienced farmers and semi-skilled farmers were interspersed, helping each other to observe and inspect each other at any time. After the second weeding was completed, a bottom-up summary was conducted. The masses unanimously affirmed that "If you want to harvest more grain, you must weed more and apply more fertilizer." Shi Cunjin seized on everyone's understanding, raised it, and made a half-year production plan: autumn crops are required to increase the yield of fine grains by three sheng per mu. Valley land should be weeded three times, corn should be weeded three times, with one application of topdressing fertilizer, Jin Huanghou should be weeded four times, with two applications of topdressing fertilizer, and cotton should be weeded five times, and all should be stripped, branched, and have the oil bars removed. After the rain, 70 mu of wasteland should be reclaimed and vegetables should be sown, drought-resistant canals should be repaired, and seedlings should be watered to protect them and fight against drought. Wheat fields should be expanded, Artemisia collected, and fertilizer should be collected to ensure that each mu of wheat field is fertilized with thirty-five loads. Sideline production, from the beginning of spring plowing, has been paid attention to in conjunction with agriculture and implemented throughout the year. Thirty head of livestock and fourteen people went out to transport goods, earning 1,513,000 yuan (Ji currency) in two and a half months; making saltpeter earned more than 36,000 jin of rice. Now thirty head of livestock and fourteen people continue to transport, and sixty-nine people make saltpeter. The village has one hundred and thirty spinning women and twenty-one weaving women, with a half-month plan to spin 274 jin of cotton and weave 183 zhang of cloth, so as not to buy cloth when the seasons change, and strive to sell some.

　　太行头等劳英石寸金积极领导
  　霍家窑生产超过往年
    【太行电】黎城霍家窑村今年的生产运动，在太行区头等劳动英雄石寸金领导下，目前已获显著成绩。有些部分已超过往年。一九四五年是该村抗战以后到一九四七年十年间生产运动最好的一年，但全村只有牲口十六头，主要农具也很缺乏；今年牲口增至三十五头，主要农具增加三倍。今年春耕开始，群众因对土地法有若干误解，思想很乱，生产劲头不大；石寸金知道大家是怕打乱平分，一面买了五亩多地，又把驴子换成两条好骡，修理农具，以此推动群众；一面积极向群众宣传解释党的政策说：“区党委已经公布，我区土改已经基本完成不再平分了，今后应把工作重心从土改转到生产方面去。”消除了群众思想顾虑，都说：“好好生产吧！要是平分，老英雄还肯买地哩？”春耕运动便开展起来。秋地施肥每亩都在三十驮以上。犁耙各一次，种金皇后的地犁耙各两遍，每亩上粪达四十驮。施肥与耙犁次数都超过往年。该村时刻准备支援前线及预防春旱，石寸金提出：“过了闰月年，跑马就种田，赶垧下种，防备春旱”，自己带头，推动全村提前下了种，又领导大家开荒，种了十六亩大麻。截至本月初，该村全部谷地已普锄两遍，棉花普锄三遍，玉茭锄过两遍，并上了追肥。拔苗锄苗中，该村贯彻了技术指导。一开始石寸金即召开技术委员会，研究锄苗技术，把自己八一一谷拔过的苗让大家看，并试验出用杨桃根和烟筋熬水治棉花油旱（害虫）的办法，推动全村治油旱。锄苗时，把全把式和半把式夹开，随时互助观摩，互相检查。二锄完成后，随即进行了自下而上的总结。群众一致肯定了“要想多打粮，就得多锄多上肥。”石寸金抓住大家这个认识，提高起来，制出半年生产计划：秋禾要求每亩地增产细粮三升。谷地普锄三次，土玉茭锄三次，上一次追肥，金皇后锄四次，上两次追肥，棉花锄五次，并全部脱裤、打杈打油条。雨后要开荒撒菜七十亩，修理旱水渠，浇苗保苗，与旱灾作斗争。要扩大麦田，割蒿集肥，保证每亩麦田施肥三十五驮。副业生产，从春耕开始即注意与农业结合，贯彻全年。三十头牲口和十四个人出外运输，两月半赚洋一百五十一万三千元（冀钞）；熬硝赚米三万六千多斤。现三十头牲口和十四个人继续运输，六十九人熬硝。全村一百三十个纺妇，二十一个织妇，半月计划纺花二百七十四斤，织布一百八十三丈，做到换季不买布，争取卖一部。
