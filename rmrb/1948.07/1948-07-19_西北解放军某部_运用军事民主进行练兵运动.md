Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army is widely using military democracy methods to conduct training exercises. In order to improve the commanding ability of cadres, the leaders of the 5th Detachment of this unit personally led a company in an exercise simulating a battle in a village on the plains, and selected company and platoon cadres from various battalions to observe. During the actual exercise, the 1st Company studied and discussed the assessment of the enemy's situation, reconnaissance of the terrain, the issuance of decisions, and the deployment of forces in segments. During the exercise, Li Chunchu, the company commander of the 1st Company, continued to attack the village after clearing the enemy's forward guard. He decided to eliminate the enemy guarding the village, ordering the 2nd and 3rd Platoons to attack the enemy from the left and right sides, and the 1st Platoon to serve as the second echelon, going to whichever side needed it depending on the situation. After everyone's discussion, it was determined that although the movement route on the left side had a stretch of open ground, it had trees, ridgelines, and earthen embankments that could be utilized, and it was easy to bypass the enemy's rear and surround them. Therefore, forces should be concentrated to attack from the left side; there was no need to keep an entire platoon in the rear, and only a small number of troops should be left on the right side to confuse and contain the enemy. Only in this way could the goal of completely annihilating the defending enemy be achieved; if the forces were dispersed to attack, at most the enemy could only be defeated. In terms of combat actions, soldiers Xu Lianfang, Zhu Xuexun, and others put forward very good opinions on the formation, the actions of the squad or group, clearing forward obstacles, and the reconnaissance of the point man.

　　西北解放军某部
    运用军事民主进行练兵运动
    【新华社西北十六日电】解放军某部广泛运用军事民主方法，进行练兵运动。该部五支队为提高干部指挥能力，支队首长亲自领导一连演习平原村落战，并抽调各营的连排干部参观。一连在实际的演习中，对判断敌情、侦察地形、下达决心、兵力部署等都分段研究讨论。演习中，一连长李春初在扫除敌之前沿警戒后，继续向村子进攻。他决心消灭该村守敌，令二、三排由左右两侧攻击敌人，一排作第二梯队，根据情况发展，那边需要向那边去。后经大家研究，认为左边运动路线虽有一段开阔地，但有树木、棱线、土坎等可以利用，且便于绕到敌人背后，包围敌人，因此应该集中兵力从左边进攻；后边不需要留一个排，右面也只要留少数部队迷惑、牵制敌人就够了。这样才能达到全歼守敌的目的；如果分散兵力进攻；至多只能击溃敌人，在战斗动作上，战士徐连方、朱学训等对队形、班或组的动作、扫除前沿障碍及尖兵的搜索等都提出很好的意见。
