Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th. The great project of rebuilding dikes and closing breaches in the Kailu section of the West Liao River in the northeastern part of Rehe Province, which lasted for half a year, was successfully completed on June 17th. The 100,000 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu) of farmland in that section, which was flooded last year, has now been restored to fertile land. The West Liao River originates in the mountainous area of Rehe. When the river flows to Sujiabao, 90 li west of Kailu City, it turns from northeast to due east. Because the river carries a lot of sand, there is a lot of silt accumulation. It also washed out a river channel to the northeast, flowing into the Xin'kai River. During the puppet Manchukuo period, an attempt was made to close the breach at Sujiabao, blocking the washed-out river channel. In August 1945, the Japanese invaders, in an attempt to use water to prevent the Soviet Red Army from advancing south, disregarded the lives and deaths of the Chinese people and dug open the blocked breach at Sujiabao. When the river rose sharply last year, the floodwaters overflowed through this breach, flooding an area of more than 500 li, covering Kailu, the northern part of Tongguo, and the southern part of the East Middle Banner, affecting 100,000 hectares of farmland. Last November, the democratic government mobilized civilian laborers to build a temporary breach closure and a 1,200-meter-long dam at the breach to prevent this year's spring floods. From February to April of this year, 60 li of river dikes were repaired, and temporary river dike breaches were urgently repaired four times, safely weathering the spring floods. In May, the construction of a 1,600-meter-long dam and diversion dam was officially started, and a solid bank protection project was built in front of the dam. In total, the entire project lasted 160 days, with 353,120 workdays. The puppet Manchukuo's Sujiabao breach closure project was only 800 meters long and took three years to complete, while this breach was half as large again as the puppet Manchukuo's breach closure, and the entire breach closure project was completed in less than half a year.

　　热省西辽河开鲁段
    复堤堵口巨大工程历时半年胜利完成
    【新华社东北七日电】热河东北部的西辽河开鲁段复堤堵口的巨大工程，前后历时半年，已于六月十七日胜利竣工。该段去年遭受水淹的十万垧（每垧十亩）耕地从此又恢复成为良田。西边河起源于热河山地，流至开鲁城西九十里苏家堡处，河流自东北折向正东；因河水沙多，淤塞甚多，又向东北冲开一条河道，流入新开河。伪满时曾在苏家堡进行堵口，将冲开的河道堵塞。一九四五年八月，日寇企图用水阻止苏联红军南下，乃不顾中国人民生死，挖开苏家堡堵口。去年河水猛涨时，大水即经此决口泛滥，淹没开鲁、通过北部及东科中旗南部达五百余里，受灾耕地十万垧。去年十一月民主政府即动员民工在决口处修筑临时堵口及拦河坝一千二百米，以防止今年春汛。今年二月至四月，又修补河堤六十里，抢修临时河堤决口四次，安然渡过了春汛。五月正式修筑拦河坝及调水坝共一千六百米，并于坝前修筑巩固护岸工程。总计全部工程历时一百六十日；施工三十五万三千一百二十个，伪满时苏家堡堵口工程仅长八百米历时三年始完工，而此次决口较伪满堵口时增大一半，不到半年即全部完成堵口工程。
