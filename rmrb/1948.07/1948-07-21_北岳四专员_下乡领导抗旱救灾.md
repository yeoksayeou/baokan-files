　　Four Commissioners of the North Yue Special District
  　Lead Disaster Relief Efforts in Rural Areas

    [Our Newspaper] Since the beginning of summer, the Fourth Special District of North Yue has suffered from severe drought, as well as wind, hail, and insect plagues, and the situation is quite serious. According to telephone and written reports received by the Fourth Administrative Office, as of the evening of the 13th of this month, among the nine counties in the entire special district, except for some areas of Quyang County where there was penetrating rain, the northwestern mountainous areas of Jianping County, and Fuping County where there were two or three finger-lengths of rain, the remaining counties had not received rain for more than a month. (At the time of publication, Fuping had heavy rain, details unknown.) In Jianping, the willows on the river beaches west of Hongzidian were so dry that many were losing their leaves. Many places have also suffered from wind, hail, and insect disasters, with hail being the most severe. According to preliminary statistics from Jingxing, Lingshou, Xingtang, Fuping, and Zhengding counties, the number of villages affected by the disaster reached 202. In Xingtang County, 80 out of 306 villages were hit by hail, accounting for a quarter of all villages. According to the county magistrate's report, the hail that fell on the 30th of last month caused severe damage to crops. In Zhengding, the hail disaster on the 30th of last month left the cotton plants bare and the melons and vegetables completely destroyed in more than a dozen villages such as Luojiazhuang in the Fifth District. Jianping and Xingtang suffered wind disasters, and the losses are temporarily uncalculated. The areas known to be affected by locusts include a small part of the Second District of Huolu, twelve villages in the Seventh District, three villages in the Eighth District, and parts of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts of Pingshan. In Sanchang area of Xingtang, a kind of pest called "black helmet" was found, which is very harmful to crops. The above areas have basically been wiped out after mobilizing the masses to catch and kill locusts. However, the locust eggs have not been completely eliminated, and the locust plague may still rise again, which should arouse the vigilance of all localities. According to people familiar with agricultural affairs, even if it rains now, most of the drought-stricken corn will not be harvested and must be uprooted and replanted with other late autumn crops. In the face of the serious drought, the Fourth District Committee and the Fourth Administrative Office of the CCP North Yue have issued an emergency drought resistance and famine preparedness instruction a few days ago, and have distributed the several thousand dan of production and disaster relief loan grain re-issued by the North Yue Administrative Office to the districts and villages that are more severely affected, and have drawn important cadres, led by Commissioner Cui Minsheng himself, to go to Zhengding, Xingtang, Jingxing and other counties to specifically lead the drought resistance and disaster relief work.

　　北岳四专员
  　下乡领导抗旱救灾
    【本报讯】入夏以来，北岳四专区苦旱之余，又遭风、雹、虫灾，情况相当严重。据四专署所获电话与书面报告，截至本月十三日晚全专区九个县，除曲阳县一部地区下透雨、建屏县西北部山地及阜平县下二三指雨外，其余县份一个多月均未落雨。（发稿时阜平已降大雨，详情未悉。）建屏洪子店河西滩杨柳，很多都旱得落叶了。许多地方又发生风灾、雹灾与虫灾，其中尤以雹灾为重。据井陉、灵寿、行唐、阜平、正定五县初步统计，受灾村庄达二○二个。行唐全县三○六村，有八十村遭雹灾，占全部村庄四分之一。据该县县长报告：上月卅日所下冰雹，使庄稼受损害甚重。正定上月三十日一次雹灾，把五区罗家庄等十几个村庄的棉花都打成光棍，瓜菜也全部砸烂。建屏、行唐遭受风灾，损失一时尚无统计。蝗虫为害地区，已知者有获鹿二区小部、七区十二个村、八区三个村，平山三区、四区、五区各一部。行唐四常一带，发现一种叫黑宝盖的害虫，吃庄稼很厉害。以上地区经发动群众捕打蝗虫基本已被扑灭。但蝗卵尚未肃清，虫患仍有复起可能，亟应引起各地警惕。据熟悉农事者谈：现在即使下了雨，受旱之玉蜀黍大部已无收成，须拔去补种其他晚秋作物。面临着严重的旱灾，中共北岳四地委、四专署已于日前发出紧急抗旱备荒指示，将北岳行署补发的几千石生产救灾贷粮，有重点地分配到受灾较重的区村，并抽出重要干部，由崔民生专员亲自带领，分赴正定、行唐、井陉等县具体领导抗旱救灾工作。
