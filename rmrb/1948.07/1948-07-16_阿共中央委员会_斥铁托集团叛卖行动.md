　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th—Moscow Radio: Agence France-Presse quoted a communique issued by the Albanian Central News Agency on July 1st from the Albanian Central Committee stating: The Albanian Central Committee fully agrees with the Cominform's resolution on the situation within the Yugoslav Communist Party. The Albanian Central Committee severely condemns the open treacherous actions of the Yugoslav Communist Party leaders, who have betrayed Marxism-Leninism and the socialist camp, and are openly fighting against the socialist motherland, the Lenin-Stalin party, and the anti-imperialist camp. The Yugoslav Communist Party leaders have betrayed the great cause of the Yugoslav people and put their country in danger. The Albanian Central Committee has always opposed the Yugoslav Communist Party Central Committee's forcing our party and country to implement their methods and their treacherous policies. The Albanian Central Committee pointed out that the Yugoslav Communist Party leaders attempted to colonize Albania. The Albanian people will continue to be loyal to their Yugoslav allies, but this is not loyalty to the anti-Marxist Yugoslav Communist Party leaders. The Albanian people and the Albanian Communist Party have always been loyal to the democratic and anti-imperialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The Albanian Central Committee thanks the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin for liberating Albania from the shackles of the anti-Marxists of Yugoslavia.

　　阿共中央委员会
    斥铁托集团叛卖行动
    【新华社陕北十四日电】莫斯科广播：法新社电讯引阿尔巴尼亚通讯社公布的阿共中央委员会七月一日的公报称：阿共中央完全赞同共产党情报局关于南共党内状况问题的决议。阿共中央严厉斥责南共领导者公开的叛卖行动，背叛了马列主义及社会主义营垒，明目张胆地向社会主义祖国，向列宁——斯大林党，向反帝国主义营垒公开斗争。南共领导者叛卖了南斯拉夫人民的伟大事业，并使其国家处于险境。阿共中央一向反对南共中央强迫我党我国实行他们的方法，实行他们的叛卖政策。阿共中央指出：南共领导者企图把阿尔巴尼亚殖民地化。阿国人民将继续忠实对待南国盟友，但这不是忠于反马克思主义的南共领导。阿国人民和阿共始终忠实于苏联领导的民主的和反帝国主义的营垒。阿共中央感谢苏联共产党和斯大林，因为他们使阿尔巴尼亚摆脱了南斯拉夫的反马克思主义者的束缚。
