Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 12th: In various parts of Northeast China, rural branches and members of the Chinese Communist Party are using their exemplary actions and leading roles to ensure the successful completion of spring plowing and actively carry out summer hoeing. In Jining County, Mudanjiang Province, under the leadership of Party members, in addition to planting more than 43,000 hectares of cultivated land, more than 5,400 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed, expanding the cultivated area by 12 percent. In the eighth district of Longjiang County, Nenjiang Province, a large number of production activists emerged during the spring plowing. The Party branch absorbed them into the Party and, through them, united and led the masses in production, thus completing the planting of all 25,000 hectares of land in the district and reclaiming nearly 600 hectares of wasteland. Currently, more than 18,000 hectares have been weeded. At the beginning of the spring plowing, the Party branch of the first administrative village in the district convened a branch meeting and passed a resolution for Party members to widely mobilize production. Party members divided their work, each uniting more than ten households of people, collecting opinions, concentrating on research, and caring for the masses in every way, solving difficulties for them. For example, when planting large fields, the village lacked corn seeds, so Party member Guan Suohuan raised funds and personally went to a distant place to buy seeds, and did not ask everyone to repay the labor even though he missed work, solving the planting difficulties of 40 hectares of land. Ten loafers in the whole village who did not work have gradually changed under the education and help of Party members. When the fourth district of Nenjiang County proposed mobilizing women to go to the fields, female Party members in each branch set an example and took the lead in demonstrating. In Hejiang Province, the slogan "One Party member leads a production team well" received an enthusiastic response from all over the province. Fifteen Party members in Zhongyi Village, Boli, led fourteen work exchange groups and promoted the active cultivation of the remaining twenty-four groups, making the village win the title of "Wheat Planting Model."

　　团结群众解决困难东北党员带头生产
    【新华社东北十二日电】东北各地中共农村支部、党员以模范行动和带头作用，保证春耕胜利完成及积极进行夏锄。牡丹江省鸡宁县在党员带头下，除种上四万三千余垧熟地外，并开荒五千四百余垧，扩大耕地面积百分之十二。嫩江省龙江县八区，在春耕中涌现大批生产积极分子。支部就吸收他们入党，并经过他们去团结与领导群众生产，因此使全区二万五千垧土地全部种完，并开荒近六百垧，目前已锄草一万八千余垧。该区第一行政村支部在春耕开始时，即召开支部会议，通过党员广泛动员生产。党员分工每人团结十余户群众，收集意见，集中研究，处处关心群众，为群众解决困难。如种大田时，村中缺少苞米种籽，党员关锁环即集资亲到远地买回种籽，误了工也不要大家还工，解决了四十垧地的播种困难。全村十个不干活的二流子，在党员分工教育帮助下，都已逐渐转变。嫩江县四区提出发动妇女下地时，各支部女党员即以身作则，带头示范。合江省提出“一个党员领导好一个生产小组”，得到各地热烈响应。勃利中义屯十五名党员分头领导十四个换工组，并推动其余二十四个组积极进行耕作，使该屯荣获“种麦模范”的称号。
