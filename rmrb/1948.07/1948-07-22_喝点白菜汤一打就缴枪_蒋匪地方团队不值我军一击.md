　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Local Teams Not Worth a Single Blow from Our Army
　　[Jidong Telegraph] Frontline reporter Zhang Fan reports: After Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits implemented the strategy of "using main forces against main forces," they had to hand over the defense of their points and lines to their local teams. However, these teams were extremely weak in combat and could not withstand a single blow. In the Jidong campaign, from June 2nd to June 25th, in 24 days, our army annihilated the entire 21st, 27th, and 37th regiments of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit local security forces, as well as the entire 7th Regiment of the bandit Hebei Provincial Guard, and the 2nd Battalion of the 28th Security Regiment. Huang Re, the Education Director of the Chiang Kai-shek Central Training Corps, held a meeting in June to review the local teams in various regions, with the participation of various departments of the bandit Ministry of National Defense. The meeting concluded that the lack of combat effectiveness of the security teams was due to: "Too few personnel, too poor treatment, disturbing the people even more than the 'National Army,' openly selling guns, and the 'Central Government' not issuing weapons." (Guo Yimin's letter to Zhu Fawu, the head of the bandit 7th Guard Regiment) In response, the bandit Ministry of National Defense did allow improvements, but lacked confidence: "Provincial funds are too difficult, so the organization (referring to local teams) is smaller, coupled with embezzlement and desertion, the actual count is only about 500 (referring to the general case). Although this year's organization has been increased, it still feels like there are too few people." (Ibid.) Facts have proven that no matter whether the Chiang Kai-shek bandit local teams have the same weapons and treatment as the bandit regular army, and no matter whether their personnel are increased, their fate of being annihilated is sealed. The bandit Hebei Guard 7th Regiment, which guarded Shixia, received eleven machine guns, three mortars, and some rifles on June 18th, and was completely captured by the People's Liberation Army, along with its personnel and weapons, after only two hours of combat the next day. The entire 8th Traffic Police Brigade and most of the 5th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's Tang Zong special agent system, despite their good weapons and equipment, could not avoid being annihilated. Today, the insurmountable difficulties of Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's insufficient troops and low morale are even more obvious. In the battle to capture Xiaoying on the Pinggu Road, as soon as contact was made, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the bandit Hebei Security 28th Regiment ordered his troops to surrender. A song full of defeatism is now circulating among the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi troops: "Eat rice and charge, stand guard and look at the terrain, half-full of dry rice, no energy, drink a little cabbage soup, and surrender at the first shot."

### “喝点白菜汤一打就缴枪”　蒋匪地方团队不值我军一击

　　“喝点白菜汤一打就缴枪”
  　蒋匪地方团队不值我军一击
    【冀东电】前线记者张帆报导：蒋傅匪实行“以主力对主力”后，其点线不得不交给其地方团队守备，但此等团队战斗力极弱，不堪一击。我军在冀东作战，从六月二日到二十五日二十四天中，即歼灭了蒋傅匪地方保安团第二十一、二十七、三十七团全部，及匪河北省守护第七团全部，保安二十八团二营。蒋匪中央训练团教育长黄热曾于六月间开会检讨各地地方团队，匪国防部各厅处均参加。会中认为各保安团队之没有战斗力，其原因是：“人数过少，待遇太差，扰民情形，比‘国军’尤甚，公开卖枪，‘中央’不发武器。”（郭一民给匪守护第七团团长朱法武的信）对此，匪国防部虽曾允许改善，但却缺乏信心：“省费太困难，故编制（指地方团队）较小，再加吃空逃亡，实计不过五百左右（系指一般者）。虽本年编制已增大，但仍感人少。”（同上）事实证明，不管蒋匪地方团队武器待遇与匪正规军相同也好，不管其人员增加也好，其被歼的命运是注定了的。守石匣的匪河北守护第七团，于六月十八日接到运来的十一挺机关枪，和三门迫击炮及一部步枪，第二天经过两小时的战斗，便被人民解放军连人带武器全部俘获了。蒋匪唐纵特务系统的交警第八总队全部及第五总队大部，武器装备虽好，但也不能避免被歼。今天蒋傅匪兵力不足，士气低落的不可克服的困难是更加明显了。在平古路攻克小营的战斗中，刚一接触，匪河北保安二十八团二营营长，便下令缴枪投降。现蒋傅匪军中，流行着一首充满失败情绪的歌谣：“吃饭打冲锋，站岗看地形，半饱干饭干的没有劲，喝点白菜汤，一打就缴枪。”
