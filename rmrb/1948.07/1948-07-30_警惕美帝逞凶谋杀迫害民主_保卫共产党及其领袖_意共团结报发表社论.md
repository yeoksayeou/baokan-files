Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 27th: TASS reports: The Italian Communist Party's organ, Unità, published an editorial on the 22nd stating that the recent series of murders and persecutions in Italy, Czechoslovakia, Japan, and the United States are all links in the same conspiracy. The editorial emphasized that now is the time to remind the people that the implementation of the Marshall Plan is not only under the guidance of industrialists, but also under the guidance of military experts and the heads of the US General Staff Intelligence Department. This fact must serve as a warning to all democrats and patriots, and prove the necessity for them to unite under the leadership of the working class and its party to defend peace and freedom. The editorial concluded that vigilance and defense of the Communist Party and its leaders is one of the responsibilities of all working people and loyal citizens.
