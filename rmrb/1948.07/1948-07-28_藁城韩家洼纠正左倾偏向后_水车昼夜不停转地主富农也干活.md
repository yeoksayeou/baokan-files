(Jizhong Electric) After correcting leftist deviations in Hanjiawa Village, Gaocheng Tenth District, the production enthusiasm of all classes has greatly increased. The village has 230 households with 1,443 people and over 29 hectares of land, which has been basically leveled. At the beginning of the land reform, the poor peasant team was impure, and they mobilized the masses to struggle against 38 middle peasant families, borrowing more than 20,000 jin of grain. After the district discovered this, although it was stopped, the borrowed grain was not immediately returned. In addition, the assets of five well-to-do middle peasant households wrongly classified as rich peasants were confiscated, causing the middle peasants to panic and lose motivation for production. The middle peasant Liu Luojing secretly buried the waterwheel buckets for fear of being struggled against. When planting in the spring, the middle peasants dared not apply fertilizer. County and district cadres held several meetings in the village, explaining the Party's land reform and production policies, but the peasants remained unmoved until they persuaded the masses to remove the labels from the five wrongly classified well-to-do middle peasants and returned the borrowed grain. The peasants, especially the middle peasants, observe how you "implement" the policies; simply "propagating" the policies without actual implementation cannot move their hearts. After this, the well-to-do middle peasant Liu Wenzeng, who previously dared not work with peace of mind, applied five pieces of peanut cake fertilizer to each mu of his millet field after the wheat harvest. The poor peasant and military family member Zhang Luoyu applied 105 jin of soybean cake to his four mu of millet. The middle peasants Liu Luocang and Liu Fake are neighbors and have the same soil quality. Fake invested more and harvested seven "da dou" of wheat. Luocang invested less and only harvested four "da dou". This year, the wheat levy was implemented based on the acreage of wheat fields and the normal yield, so their families contributed the same amount. Luocang regretfully said to Fake, "The land is the same, you harvested more, and I harvested less, but we both contributed the same. I regret it." In order to harvest more grain, he rushed to weave several pieces of cloth to sell and applied two "dou" of black beans and five pieces of soybean cake to his three mu of millet land. The village's sideline occupations are also very developed, with 86 weaving machines, mostly operated by men weaving and women spinning. More than 20 households are engaged in milling flour and making noodles. Their sideline occupations and agriculture are combined, ensuring that neither is neglected. In the recent days of drought, the village's waterwheels have been running day and night, with one set of livestock and one set of people, so that idle livestock do not idle the waterwheels. The middle peasant Liu Luojing also dug out the waterwheel buckets he had buried for fear of being struggled against and discussed with the military family member Chen Luozhao about jointly building a waterwheel. After the wheat harvest, the village dug a new well and added four waterwheels. Under the influence of everyone's active production, the lazy people Liu Wanzi and Liu Jigong have also started to work. Two rich peasant households and one landlord household in the village have also started working.

　　藁城韩家洼纠正左倾偏向后
  　水车昼夜不停转地主富农也干活
    【冀中电】藁城十区韩家洼纠偏后，各阶层生产情绪大大提高。该村共二百三十户，一千四百四十三口人，地廿九顷多，土地基本上已经填平了。土改开始时，贫农团队伍不纯，曾发动群众斗争了三十八家中农，借出粮食二万多斤。区上发觉后，虽然制止了，但是借的粮食并未立时退回，又加上五户富裕中农被错订成富农查封了家产，因此中农很恐慌，生产没有劲。中农刘洛景因怕斗争，把水车斗子偷着埋了起来。春天种地时，中农们不敢施肥。县区干部到该村连续开了几次会，说明了党的土改与生产政策，但农民仍不动，直至说服群众给五户错订的富裕中农揭了封。退回了借粮。中农们才安了心。农民特别是中农是看你“做”的政策如何，你只“宣传”政策而不实际做是不能打动他的心的，这以后，富裕中农刘文增过去不敢安心做活，麦收后，他每亩谷子拦上了五块花生仁饼。贫农军属张洛玉四亩谷子就拦了一百零五斤豆饼。中农刘洛藏和刘法科是地邻，一样的地质。法科下的本大，收七大斗麦。洛藏下的本小，只收四大斗。今年麦征实行了按麦田亩数及常年应产量的负担办法，他俩家出的一样。洛藏后悔的对法科说：“一样的地，你打的多，我打的少，可是咱俩一样的拿差，我可后悔了。”他为了多打粮食，赶着织出几块布折卖了，在三亩谷地里，施上了二斗黑豆，五块豆饼。该村副业也很发达，八十六张织布机，大部是男织女纺。经营磨面和作挂面的有廿多家。他们的副业和农业都是结合着作，作到两不耽误。前些天天旱，这村的水车昼夜不停。牲口一套人一套，闲牲口不闲水车。中农刘洛景因怕斗埋起来的水车斗子也刨出来，还和军属陈洛昭商量好伙制一辆水车。麦收后，该村打了一眼新井，添了四辆水车。在大家积极生产的影响下，懒汉刘碗子、刘计功也生产起来了。村里两户富农，一户地主，也干起活来。
