Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, 6th Urgent Dispatch: After nine days and nights of fierce fighting in the Biao＠ area of eastern Henan, our Huadong People's Liberation Army has completely annihilated the reorganized 75th Division and the newly organized 21st Brigade under the command of the Jiang enemy's Qu Shounian Corps, capturing generals such as Qu Shounian and Shen Chengnian alive. We are now continuing to besiege and annihilate the reorganized 25th Division under the command of Huang Botao Corps, as well as the 3rd Rapid Column, the Second General Headquarters of the Traffic Police, and other units. The reorganized 5th Division, 70th Division, 83rd Division, and the reorganized 72nd Division, originally under the command of the Qu Shounian Corps, led by Qiu Qingquan Corps, have also been divided, besieged, and annihilated by our forces, suffering heavy casualties. In particular, the local Sichuan unit, the reorganized 72nd Division (which was annihilated once last year), is completely trapped in a situation where its ammunition and food are exhausted, awaiting annihilation. Commanders and Political Commissar Chen Yi and Deputy Commander and Deputy Political Commissar Su Yu of our Huadong Field Army, in view of the 72nd Division facing its second annihilation, issued an urgent proclamation to the officers and soldiers of the division, urging them to wake up as soon as possible, liberate themselves, and avoid unnecessary sacrifice. The full text of the proclamation is as follows:

　　Chen and Su Issue an Urgent Proclamation
　　To the Besieged and Trapped Reorganized 72nd Division
　　Urging Them to Awaken Early and Liberate Themselves

General Yu Jinyuan, Commander of the Reorganized 72nd Division, and all officers and soldiers:

Your division is currently besieged. Regardless of the distant causes, the immediate cause is entirely due to Chiang Kai-shek's command errors. After the fall of Kaifeng, Chiang Kai-shek mistakenly judged that our army would cross the Yellow Flood Area to join forces with Liu and Deng, and attack and annihilate the Hu Lian and Wu Shaohou Corps, rather than seek battle opportunities in eastern Henan to continue fighting your army. Under this erroneous judgment, he ordered the Qiu and Qu Corps to move south from the Kaifeng-Minquan line, attempting to relieve the imagined crisis of Hu and Wu being attacked. Unexpectedly, our army withdrew from the Kaifeng-Minquan line to the Tongxu, Qixian, and Suixian line, setting a trap to welcome your army, and your army fell completely into our trap. The 75th Division and the New 21st Brigade have now been completely eliminated, and Corps Commander Qu Shounian and Division Commander Shen Chengnian have been captured at the same time. At this point, Chiang Kai-shek became anxious and hastily dispatched the Huang Botao Corps from Tengxian to reinforce, but as soon as they arrived in the Suixian area, they were surrounded by our army. Yesterday, part of them was annihilated, and the rest are about to be completely annihilated. Your division is located at Tiefo Temple in northern Sui, only twenty or thirty miles away from Huang Botao. This situation must be completely clear. Qiu Qingquan, leading the 5th, 70th, and 83rd Divisions, has been besieged in the ＠xian area for nine days of fierce fighting, suffering heavy losses and unable to take care of themselves. How can they assist your division? Hu Lian and Wu Shaohou are being held back by our Liu and Deng armies in the Yellow Flood Area, and even if they want to provide northern support, it is impossible. Your division has been besieged for ten days, trapped in a situation where food and ammunition are exhausted, and is already facing its second annihilation. We remember that when your division was annihilated in Tai'an last year, your former division commander, General Yang Wen＠, once mentioned the pain of being discriminated against by Chiang Kai-shek in the local units, and deeply regretted not being liberated earlier. General Yang is now safe and sound in Harbin, and all the officers and soldiers of your division who were liberated in Tai'an have been treated favorably. You must know this. Politically speaking, Chiang Kai-shek's regime has no future and is universally recognized. And its military decline is even more deeply experienced by your division commander and all officers and soldiers. If your division wants to make unnecessary sacrifices for Chiang Kai-shek, the dictator, you will not only leave behind eternal shame, but also fail the expectations of the elders and family members in your hometown. Only our People's Liberation Army can liberate your division. Only our Communist Party of China can guide your division to serve the people. If your division commander and all officers and soldiers are willing to raise the banner of righteousness and join the anti-Chiang united front, our army will immediately express its welcome, turn enemies into friends, and guarantee that those who return with a division will be reorganized into a division, and those who return with a brigade or regiment will be reorganized into a brigade or regiment. If there are still people in your division who are stubborn and want to sacrifice the lives of all officers and soldiers to obtain the title of Chiang's lackey and fight to the end, then our army will resolutely annihilate your division. In the Sui＠ battlefield, your division is the weakest. The reason why our army first annihilated the Qu Shounian, Shen Chengnian, and Huang Botao units without focusing on your division is that your division is a local unit and we hope your division will realize this. Now that your division is at a critical juncture, a swift decision must be made as to what to do, which is our sincere hope.

　　华东人民解放军豫东大捷
    歼敌一个师一个旅
    俘敌兵团长区寿年师长沈澄年
    正围歼整二十五师及第三快速纵队
    【新华社豫东前线六日急电】我华东人民解放军在豫东睥＠地区，经九日夜激战，已全歼蒋敌区寿年兵团所属之整编七十五师及新编二十一旅，生俘区寿年、沈澄年等将级军官，现正继续围歼黄伯韬兵团所属之整编二十五，及第三快速纵队，交警第二总部等部，而邱清泉兵团所率之整编第五师，七十师，八十三师，及原属区寿年兵团之整编七十二师等部亦被我分割围歼，伤亡极大，其中尤以川籍地方系整编七十二师（该师曾于去年被歼一次）完全陷于弹尽粮绝被围待歼境地。我华东野战军司令员兼政委陈毅、副司令员兼副政委粟裕两将军，鉴于七十二师面临第二次被歼之命运，特向该师官兵发出紧急文告，劝其及早醒悟，自行解放，免除无谓之牺牲。文告全文如下：
    　陈粟两将军发出紧急文告　告被围困整的七十二师　劝其及早觉悟自行解放整编七十二师师长余锦源将军暨全体官兵均鉴：贵师此次被围，远因不论，近因则完全由于蒋介石的指挥错误。蒋介石于开封失守后，错误地判断本军将越黄泛区与刘邓会合，攻歼胡琏、吴绍周两兵团，而不是在豫东寻求战机，继续打贵军，他在这种错误判断之下，乃以邱、区两兵团，由开封民权之线南下，企图解救幻想中的胡、吴被攻危机。不料本军由开封民权之线撤至通许、杞县、睢县之线，张网以迎贵军，贵军乃全部落我网中。七十五师及新二十一旅现已全部解决，区寿年兵团长、沈澄年师长同时被俘。这时蒋介石急了，仓卒调黄伯韬兵团由滕县赶来增援，但刚到睢县地区，即被本军包围，昨日已歼一部，其余即将全歼。贵师位于睢北铁佛寺，与黄伯韬相距不过二三十里，此种情形，当已完全明了。邱清泉率五师、七十师、八十三师被围于＠县地区，激战九日，损失惨重，自顾不暇，何能援助贵师。胡琏、吴绍周被我刘邓大军钳制于黄泛区，虽欲北援，亦不可能。贵师被围旬日，陷于粮尽弹绝境地，业已面临第二次被歼命运。我等念及贵师去年被歼于泰安时，贵师前师长杨文＠将军曾经言及地方系部队所受蒋介石歧视的痛苦，深以未能早获解放为憾。杨将军现在哈尔滨，安然无恙，泰安被解放之贵师一切官兵均受优待，诸位谅必是知道的。从政治上言，蒋介石政权绝无前途，已为举世所公认。而其军事的日趋崩溃，自更为贵师长及全体官兵所切身体验。贵师如欲为蒋介石独夫作无谓之牺牲，不仅将遗万世之羞，抑且有负故乡父老家人之望。能解放贵师者，唯我人民解放军。能引导贵师转入为人民服务之途者，唯我中国共产党。贵师长及全体官兵果肯高举义旗，加入反蒋统一战线，本军当立即表示欢迎，化敌为友，保证贵师以一师来归者编为一师，以一旅一团来归者编为一旅一团。如贵师中仍有人执迷不悟，必欲牺牲全师官兵之生命，换取蒋贼走狗之头衔，坚决作战到底，则本军必将坚决歼灭贵师。在睢＠战场中，贵师是一个最弱的师。本军之所以先歼区寿年、沈澄年、黄伯韬诸部而未及贵师者，诚以贵师是一个地方系部队，希望贵师有所觉悟。现当贵师紧急关头，何去何从，迅予决择，是所至盼。
