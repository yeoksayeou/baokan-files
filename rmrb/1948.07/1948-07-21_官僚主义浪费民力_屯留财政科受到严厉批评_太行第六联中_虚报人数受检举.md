　　Bureaucratic Waste of People's Labor
  　Tunliu Finance Section Receives Severe Criticism
  　Taihang Sixth Joint Middle School
  　Falsely Reporting Numbers Under Investigation
    [Taiyue Telegraph] The Taiyue Administrative Office issued a circular to all special districts and county governments on the 12th of this month, criticizing the Tunliu County Government's Finance Section for causing two instances of wasting people's labor due to its bureaucratic work style. In January, over 2,500 shi of millet were transported to Yangcheng. Because the leadership did not inspect the work on a regular basis, they did not know which warehouses had grain or not, nor the quality of the grain. During the grain transport, they were unable to grasp the warehouse situation, and all the transported grain was bad, unable to be eaten or preserved. The long-distance transport of hundreds of miles wasted a lot of people's labor. Recently, grain was again transported to × county, allocating 23 large carts. Upon arrival at × village, there was no grain in the warehouse. A chaotic search ensued, wasting two days and a great deal of people's labor, with 46 workers alone. Therefore, the Taiyue Administrative Office, in its circular, criticized the Tunliu County Government for managing the people's property with a careless and bureaucratic attitude, wasting people's labor, and damaging the people's interests. It called on every finance and grain cadre to cherish revolutionary property and people's labor, and to stand firmly at their posts, serving the people wholeheartedly.
    [Taihang News] The Finance Section of the Sixth Special District of Taihang, when reviewing the June final accounts, discovered that the Sixth Joint Middle School had falsely reported 88 days of vacation for publicly funded students, and over-reported 3,818 jin of grain and vegetable money converted to rice. The cadre training class attached to the school also over-reported 1,608 jin of wheat in June. The Special District Finance Section, upon discovering this problem, immediately sent people to the school to check the accounts. They found that the school had consistently been reporting expenses based on the established number of personnel, not according to the actual number of people, falsely reporting and creating fictitious publicly funded positions. After the reorganization, opposing false reporting and fictitious reporting was proposed, and the school only calculated according to the actual number of people and days from January to May of this year. In June, they began to undermine the system again, damaging the interests of the public and satisfying the selfish interests of the small collective. This kind of undisciplined behavior should be resolutely opposed, and the person in charge of the school should conduct a strict self-examination.

　　官僚主义浪费民力
  　屯留财政科受到严厉批评
  　太行第六联中
  　虚报人数受检举
    【太岳电】太岳行署于本月十二日通令各专署县府，指责屯留县政府财政科因官僚主义作风，造成两次运粮浪费民力的现象。一月份往阳城送小米两千五百余石，因领导上平日对工作不加检查，不知道哪个仓库有粮无粮，也不知道粮食好坏。运粮时无法掌握仓库情况，运去的都是坏粮，既不能吃，更不能保存，数百里长途运输浪费了很多民力。最近又往×县运粮，拨去二十三辆大车，到了×村，仓库里都没有粮食，到处乱找，误了两天时间，浪费民力甚多，只工人就有四十六个。因此太岳行署在通令中指责屯留县府用马虎从事、官僚主义的态度管理人民财产，浪费民力，损害人民利益的现象。并号召每个财粮干部，必须很好的爱护革命财产，爱惜民力，很好的站在自己的岗位上，全心全意为人民服务。
    【太行讯】太行六专署财政科在审查六月份决算时，发现第六联中虚报公费生假期天数八十八天，多报食粮、菜金折米三千八百十八斤。在该校附设的干训班六月份亦多报销麦子一千六百零八斤。专署财政科发现了这个问题，立即派人前赴该校检查帐目，发现该校去年一贯是按编制人数报销，不按实有人数计算，虚报、空报公费名额。自整编后，提出反对虚报、空报，该校今年一月至五月份才依实有人数天数计算。到六月份，又开始破坏制度，损害大公家利益，满足小公家的私利。这种目无纪律的行为应当坚决反对，该校负责人应作严格检查。
