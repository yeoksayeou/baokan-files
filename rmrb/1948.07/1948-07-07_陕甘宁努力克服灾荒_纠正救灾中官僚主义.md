Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is resolutely opposing bureaucracy in disaster relief in order to rapidly overcome the serious famine. In addition to commending Huachi County in the Longdong Sub-region for its outstanding achievements in resettling migrants and refugees, Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, and Vice-Chairmen Yang Mingxuan and Liu Jing, severely criticized the leading organs of Mizhi County on the 15th of last month for neglecting production-based disaster relief. They pointed out: "Because you have not paid enough attention to production-based disaster relief work, some areas have only provided passive relief, while some areas have completely neglected disaster relief work. As a result, even non-disaster areas and lightly affected areas have experienced a large number of people suffering from hunger edema, and even some deaths from starvation have occurred. The leading organs have not paid serious attention to this and have not provided rescue, which proves the extent to which you have neglected production-based disaster relief work! This is a serious manifestation of being irresponsible to the people! All cadres should be educated with this painful lesson to make them clearly understand what kind of prudent and responsible attitude they should adopt towards disaster victims in the future; otherwise, it is a crime. Now, most of the county-level cadres in your county have gone to the countryside to carry out production and rescue work, which is completely necessary and correct. It is hoped that you will maintain regular contact with them and provide timely and specific guidance to them, relying on the masses to work hard to overcome these last difficult days."

　　The Masses Daily also published an editorial on the 14th entitled "Eliminate Bureaucracy, Rapidly Extinguish the Famine." The editorial pointed out that counties such as Huachi, Jiaxian, and Jingbian have implemented the instructions of the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government on disaster relief, and have specifically solved the famine problem. However, the disaster situation in some areas is still extremely serious. The basic reason is that the leading organs in these areas have adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards the serious famine that is related to the lives of the people. This is manifested in the failure to seriously study the instructions of the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government, and the failure to conduct in-depth investigations and specifically solve the difficulties of the disaster victims, resulting in the failure to combine general disaster relief calls with specific guidance. Secondly, the two policies of the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government, "combining disaster relief with production" and "mobilizing the masses to help each other," have not been well studied and implemented, resulting in a "pure relief viewpoint," and being helpless after the relief grain is distributed. The editorial pointed out that the primary task of the current production and disaster relief work is to specifically carry out the struggle against bureaucracy. From the senior leading organs, all should strictly review, summarize experience, implement discipline, and improve the enthusiasm for serving the people in accordance with the policies and instructions of the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government. Those responsible persons who disobey instructions and prolong the suffering of the people should be removed and punished. Party and government leading organs at the border region, sub-region, and county levels should quickly send capable personnel to the heavily affected areas to take effective measures to solve the problems of famine and epidemic diseases.

　　陕甘宁努力克服灾荒
    纠正救灾中官僚主义
    【新华社西北五日电】陕甘宁边区坚决反对救灾中的官僚主义，以迅速克服严重灾荒。陕甘宁边区政府林伯渠主席、杨明轩、刘景副主席除对踏实负责安置移民难民成绩卓著之陇东分区华池县予以表扬外，上月十五日对米脂县领导机关忽视生产救灾提出了严正批评；指出：“由于你们对生产救灾工作不够重视，有些地区只做了消极救济，有些地区则根本忽视救灾工作，以致非灾区及轻灾区也发生了大量饿肿人甚至已有饿死人的现象。而领导机关对此竟未引起严重注意和抢救，证明你们对生产救灾工作的忽视已至何种程度！这是对人民太不负责的严重表现！应以此沉痛的教训，教育所有干部，使他们明确认识今后应以何种审慎负责的态度对待灾民，否则就是犯罪。现你县县上干部已大部下乡进行生产抢救工作，这是完全必要和正确的。望与他们经常联系，并及时具体指导他们，依靠群众，努力渡过此最后艰难的日月”。
    此间群众日报亦于十四日发表题为“肃清官僚主义，迅速扑灭灾荒”之社论。指出华池、葭县、靖边等县执行西北局及边府救灾指示，均已具体解决灾荒问题，但部分地区灾情仍极严重，其基本原因就是各该地领导机关对人民生命所关的严重灾荒采取了官僚主义态度，表现在对西北局及边府的指示没有认真研究，又不进行深入调查与具体解决灾民的困难问题，致使一般救灾号召没有与具体指导相结合。其次是对西北局及边府“救灾和生产相结合”及“发动群众互助互济”两条方针未很好研究与执行，产生“单纯救济观点”，救济粮发完了便束手无策。社论指出目前生产救灾工作的首要任务就是具体的进行反官僚主义的斗争，从高级领导机关起，均应根据西北局和边府的方针指示严格检讨，总结经验，执行纪律，提高为人民服务的热情，撤换与制裁那些违抗指示使人民延长痛苦的负责人。边区、分区及县级党政领导机关均应迅速抽派得力人员到重灾区采取有效办法解决灾荒病疫问题。
