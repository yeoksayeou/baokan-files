Xinhua News Agency, East China, 21st: According to the Shanghai New Road magazine published on June 26th, the situation in the isolated city of Jinan is as follows: "The only external transportation from Jinan is by plane, which has been monopolized by the wealthy class. Although a plane ticket from Jinan to Nanjing costs more than 300 million (蒋币, Jiang currency, hereinafter the same), it is still extremely crowded. Misses, wives, gold bars, US dollars, and diamonds are all frantically fleeing south." "Market prices are abnormally soaring. A ton of coking coal, costing 5 million, quickly rises to 30 million, while flour has become bran and sand." The magazine admits that the citizens of Jinan are all longing for the People's Liberation Army to enter the city. "They talk about it every day: 'Where has the Eighth Route Army advanced to?' Everyone believes that the current serious situation in Jinan will be the darkness before dawn."

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 22nd: Many merchants and civilians in Zhengzhou have fled to the Liberated Areas due to the unbearable exploitation by the Chiang government. According to news from the Henan-West front: Merchants who have just escaped from Zhengzhou say that the Chiang government authorities in the city are deeply fearful of the People's Liberation Army's offensive. Recently, they have been stepping up the construction of fortifications day and night, and demolishing civilian houses on a large scale. The merchant said that he originally had seven houses, all of which have been razed to the ground by the Chiang army. Dozens of fruit trees have also been cut down, and more than 20 acres of garden land have been turned into trenches, making it impossible for the whole family to live. Another example is a photo studio in the west entrance of West Guan Street. Recently, it was assigned more than eight stones of wheat, more than one hundred and sixty sacks, and 4.3 million yuan (蒋币, Jiang currency, hereinafter the same). It also had to send two workers every day to build fortifications, which made the store manager unable to cope and flee Zhengzhou. His old mother and guarantor are still being held in the town office. Now, larger stores are being assigned more than one hundred stones of military wheat at a time. Many stores have to hang up signs saying "Clearing accounts, suspending business." In the west section of Datong Road alone, more than 50 stores have declared bankruptcy, including Hua Da Foreign Goods Store, Fuyuan Foreign Goods Store, Lifeng Tea Store, and Central Tobacco Company. All that remains are some small food stalls. Now prices in the city are soaring. White flour has risen to nearly 140,000 yuan per catty, and ordinary citizens have to spend at least 500,000 yuan of Chiang currency to barely maintain a day's life.

　　在黑暗中盼天明
  　济南人民生活困难渴望解放郑州商民不堪压榨逃入我区
    【新华社华东二十一日电】据六月二十六日出版的上海新路杂志透露孤岛济南的情况称：“济南唯一的对外交通是飞机，已为豪富阶级所占有，虽然从济南到南京的飞机票要三万万多元（蒋币，下同）然仍拥挤异常，小姐、太太、金条和美钞、钻石，都疯狂南逃。”“市面物价畸形狂涨，五百万一吨的焦煤，一涨就成三千万，而面粉也变成了麸皮和砂土”。该杂志承认济南市民均渴望着人民解放军进城。“他们天天在谈论：‘八路军进到那里了。’大家都认为：目前济南严重局势，将是黎明前的黑暗。”
    【新华社中原二十二日电】郑州许多商民因不堪蒋政府压榨逃入解放区。据豫西前线消息：刚从郑州逃出的商人称，该城蒋政府当局深惧人民解放军之进攻，近来日夜加紧构筑工事，大肆拆毁民房。该商人说，他原有七间房子，已全部被蒋军扒平，几十颗果树亦被砍光，二十多亩园地变成了壕沟，以致全家无法生活。又如西关大街西口某照像馆，最近一次因被派麦八石多，麻袋一百六十余只，款四百三十万元（蒋币，下同），每天还要出两个工去筑工事，致该店经理无法应付而逃离郑州，其老母和保人还被押在镇公所里。现较大商店，一次派军麦就是百石以上。许多商店只得挂上“清理帐目，停止营业”的牌子。仅大同路西段一街，宣告倒闭的就有华大洋货店、福源洋货店、利丰茶店、中心烟号等五十余家，剩下的只有一些小吃铺。现在城内物价飞涨，白面每斤近已涨达十四万元，普通市民至少要花蒋币五十万元方能勉强维持一天生活。
