　　【Jidong Front, 29th dispatch】In the battle to liberate Fengrun City, a certain battalion of our army captured the city in fifteen minutes, with only two casualties on our side, setting a glorious record for capturing a city in a short period of time with minimal casualties and maximum force. After the battalion's "three check-ups," "speaking bitterness," and "comparison and evaluation" movements, morale has been further boosted. During the Chahar-Suiyuan Campaign, they repeatedly requested to be the main attacking force and to fight major victories. However, each time the main attack task was assigned to other units. On the evening of the 3rd, the battalion, along with friendly forces, marched sixty li in eight hours, capturing the outer strongholds of Gaolipu and Yanjiapu, and plunged into the enemy's defensive center, Fengrun City, immediately occupying the four passes and dividing the enemy's entire county defense system. After 12:00 noon on the 14th, under the unified command of higher authorities, the battalion carried out ten hours of extremely precise preparations for attacking the city. A crossfire of artillery and machine guns was formed in the 100-meter-wide area of the planned assault point, and every loophole in the city was tightly sealed by our forces. There was a clear division of labor for each target to be sealed off. The assault teams all studied the terrain. At 1:00 p.m., the general offensive was launched, and the defense of Fengrun City, held by more than 2,000 enemies, immediately became ineffective. One company of the battalion first captured the city in eight minutes. Then, a certain battalion captured the entire city in seven minutes. Including the time of the first company to capture the city, the entire battalion captured the city in only fifteen minutes, with only two casualties on our side.

　　我军某营打丰润十五分钟登上城
    【冀东前线廿九日电】解放丰润城之战，我军某部某营十五分钟全营登城，自己只伤两名；创短促时间内以最小伤亡最大兵力登城之光辉纪录。该营“三查”、“诉苦”、“比评”运动后，士气更为高涨。察绥战役时，曾屡次要求主攻，打大胜仗。但每次主攻任务，都被别的单位担任了。三日晚，该营随同各友军，在八小时内行军六十里，打开外围高力铺、阎家铺等据点，猛扑敌防御中枢丰润城，当即占领四关，各个分割敌全县防御体系。十四日正午十二时后，该营在上级统一指挥下，做了十小时极精密的攻城准备工作，在一百米宽的预备突击点地带，组成大炮、机枪的交叉火力，城上每个枪眼，都被我严密封锁。封锁对象都有明确分工。突击队都看了地形。下午一时发起总攻，两千多敌人据守着的丰润城防御，顿时失效。该营一个连首先以八分钟的速度全连登城。接着，某营以七分钟速度全部登城，连同最先登城连队时间，全营登城只费十五分钟，自己只负伤两人。
