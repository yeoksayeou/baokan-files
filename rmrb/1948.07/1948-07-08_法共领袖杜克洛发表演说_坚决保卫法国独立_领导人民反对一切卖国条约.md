Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Agence France-Presse, Paris dispatch: French Communist leader Duclos delivered a speech on June 27th at a meeting commemorating the personnel of the Paris Commune of 1871 who were killed at Vincennes Castle. Duclos pointed out: "Due to hatred for the people of Paris, Thiers did not hesitate to transform himself into Bismarck's ally in 1871. Today, due to hatred for the French people, the leaders of the Third Force (referring to the political combination centered on the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and a portion of the Radical Socialist Party), in complete coordination with De Gaulle and under the protection of American imperialism, have become allies of the West German Nazis. "Duclos expressed the Communist Party's determination to lead the struggle against 'despicable politicians who dare to sign shameful enslavement treaties' in order to defend France's independence." Duclos concluded: "We will fight against the Marshall Plan and everything related to it, such as the Brussels Military Alliance, the London agreement on the German question, the Franco-American bilateral treaty (which will turn France into a colony of the United States), and so on." Note: Thiers was the head of the bourgeois traitorous government during the Paris working-class revolution in 1871. In September 1870, the French army was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War, and the French Emperor was captured. The Prussian army continued to advance towards Paris. The people of Paris rose up to overthrow the monarchy and declared a republic; the bourgeoisie seized the opportunity to usurp power, organize a government, and under the urging of the people, announced the continuation of the war of resistance against the Prussian army, and formed a militia of more than 200,000 people, mainly workers and the poor, to defend Paris. However, the bourgeoisie feared the growth of the working class's strength and conspired to compromise with the Prussian army. In March of the following year, the traitorous government signed a traitorous treaty with Prussia, ceding territory and paying indemnities. The people of Paris rose up to oppose Thiers' treacherous behavior. On March 18, the people of Paris, under the leadership of the working class, launched an uprising and established the first proletarian revolutionary regime in history—the Paris Commune. At this time, Thiers' traitorous government fled Paris, openly colluded with the enemy of the French nation—Prussian Prime Minister Bismarck—to attack Paris, and finally strangled the Paris Commune.

　　法共领袖杜克洛发表演说
    坚决保卫法国独立
    领导人民反对一切卖国条约
    【新华社陕北五日电】法新社巴黎讯：法共领袖杜克洛，六月廿七日在纪念一八七一年巴黎公社人员在文森涅斯城堡被杀的会上发表演说。杜克洛指出：“由于对巴黎人民的憎恨，梯也尔在一八七一年毫不犹豫地一变而为俾斯麦的盟友。今天，由于对法国人民的憎恨，第三种力量（按指以社会党为中心之社会党、人民共和党和一部分急进社会党分子的政治结合）的领袖们，与戴高乐完全协调一致，并在美帝国主义保护之下，变成西德纳粹分子的盟友。杜克洛表示共产党决心领导反对‘卑鄙的政客们胆敢签订可耻奴役条约’的斗争，以保卫法国的独立。”杜克洛结语称：“我们将对马歇尔计划以及一切与之有关的事情，如布鲁塞尔军事同盟、伦敦对德问题协议、法美双边条约（它要把法国变成美国的殖民地）等等作斗争。”按：梯也尔是一八七一年巴黎工人阶级革命时代资产阶级卖国政府的首领。一八七○年九月，法军在普（即以后的德国）法战争中覆败，法皇被俘，普鲁士军继续向巴黎进攻。巴黎人民奋起推翻帝制，宣告共和；资产阶级乘机篡夺政权，组织政府，在人民的督促下宣布继续对普军抗战，并组成以工人及贫民为主的民军二十余万，保卫巴黎。但资产阶级恐惧工人阶级力量的增长，阴谋与普军妥协。次年三月，卖国政府即与普鲁士签订割地赔款的卖国条约。巴黎人民群起反对梯也尔卖国行为。三月十八日，巴黎人民在工人阶级领导下举行起义，建立了历史上第一个无产阶级的革命政权——巴黎公社，此时梯也尔卖国政府逃出巴黎，公开勾结法国民族敌人——普鲁士首相俾士麦，向巴黎进攻，并最后扼杀了巴黎公社。
