(Taihang Electric) Since the Xu Corps of our North China Field Army launched a powerful offensive against the Chiang army in Jinzhong, the Chiang-Yan bandits have been extremely panicked. Yan bandits in Taiyuan, Yuci, Taigu, and other places along the Tongpu Railway are everywhere forcibly seizing residents to build fortifications. Inside and outside Taiyuan city, organizations and schools, both male and female students, are being forced into service. The Taiyuan Yan Bandit's "People's Daily" successively published editorials, exclaiming, "Urgently defend Jinzhong." The Taiyuan Yan bandits are implementing strict inspections of merchants entering the city, who must have a guarantor personally holding a letter of guarantee, which must be inspected and stamped by the police station in the residence and at the city gate before they can enter the city. The Yan Bandit "People's Defense Army" held a mobilization meeting in the People's Park under the pretext of "Defending Taiyuan," and forcibly ordered women in the city to carry out "training" with guns. Merchants in Yuci Chengguan were also forced to undergo "collective training." The Taiyuan Waterworks Bureau began restricting water use as early as June 5th. The Northwest Industrial Construction Company's Electricity Department issued regulations restricting the use of electric lights: all public and private business door lights, horizontal signboard lights, window display lights, office buildings of organizations, and civilian lights were placed under control without exception. To prepare for Taiyuan being besieged, the Yan bandits forcibly ordered merchants and residents in the city to merge their residences, demolish houses, and rush to repair the airport inside the city. According to the People's Daily, the Yan bandits personally issued a handwritten order stating: "If anyone only seeks personal convenience and disregards overall safety, and intentionally fails to merge when they should, they should be struggled against, and the military police and constitution should assist the housing management committee in enforcing it." Taiyuan City presents a scene of chaos. After our army recovered Qixian County, prices rose several times a day. According to Luo Jinlin, a merchant from Taiyuan, in late June, white flour was selling for 320,000 to 330,000 yuan per catty, and millet for 370,000 to 380,000 yuan. A sesame seed cake weighing only one tael has risen from 30,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan each. Food is extremely scarce, and the people's lives are extremely difficult, hoping for our army to liberate Taiyuan like a great drought hoping for rain.

　　晋中我军强大攻势下
    太原阎匪极度恐慌
    【太行电】自我华北野战军徐兵团向晋中蒋军强大攻势展开后，蒋阎匪恐慌异常。同蒲沿线太原、榆次、太谷等地阎匪，到处强抓居民加修工事。太原市内外机关团体及学校男女学生，均被迫征用。阎匪太原民众日报先后发表社论，惊呼：“紧急保卫晋中”。太原阎匪对入城商民实行严格检查，必须由保人亲持保证书，到驻地及城门口警察派出所检验后，加盖戳记，始得进城。该市阎匪“民卫军”曾假民众公园举行“保卫太原”的动员大会，并强令市内妇女实行持枪“训练”。榆次城关商贩亦被迫“集训”。太原自来水管理局，早于六月五日起，即限制用水。西北实业建设公司电业处颁发电灯限制使用办法：凡公私商号门灯、横式招牌灯、窗橱灯、机关团体办公处及市民用灯，均毫无例外置于管制之列。为防备太原被困，阎匪更强令城内商民合并居住，拆毁民房，赶修城内飞机场。据民众日报载：阎匪曾亲颁手令称：“如有只图个人便利，不顾整体安危，该合并而故意不合并者，应予斗争，由军警宪协助房管会强制执行。”太原市呈现一片混乱。我军收复祁县后，物价更一日数涨。据来自太原的商民罗锦林谈：六月下旬，白面每斤已卖到三十二、三万元，小米三十七、八万元。重仅一两的烧饼，每个已由三万元涨到五万元。食粮奇缺，市民生活极度困难，祈盼我军解放太原如大旱望雨。
