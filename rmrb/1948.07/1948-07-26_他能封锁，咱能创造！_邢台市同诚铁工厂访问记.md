　　"They Can Blockade, We Can Create!"
    ——A Visit to the Tongcheng Iron Factory in Xingtai City

    The Land Law Outline promulgated a policy protecting industry and commerce—the instructions of the Central Bureau of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu to return and compensate wrongly struggled industry and commerce were specifically implemented in Xingtai. The industrialists and businessmen in Xingtai City have recently completely stabilized their mood for running industry and commerce. Managers have begun to busy themselves with repairing their storefronts and restoring and expanding their businesses. Naliang Garden and Liping Market have built rows of brand-new market houses, becoming two bustling markets. People walking through every commercial street in Nanguan can feel a sense of new life. My visit to the Tongcheng Iron Factory deepened this fresh feeling.
    Tongcheng was a private iron factory opened in 1943. At that time, due to various restrictions imposed by the Japanese, the factory could not develop. After liberation, with the assistance of the democratic government and bank loans, the number of workers increased from seventeen during the enemy occupation to twenty-one, and the capital increased from 30,000 yuan to 1.6 million yuan (by the end of last year). In the past, it could only manufacture waterwheels and cotton gin bows, but now it can manufacture more complex machines such as lathes and planers.
    The manager is called Liu Wenduo. He became an apprentice blacksmith at the age of sixteen and is now over fifty years old. When I asked how the workers manufactured lathes and planers, he immediately showed a victorious smile and pulled me to the workshop to see the planer. He explained the motivation and role of manufacturing this machine, saying: "In the second half of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang implemented strict control over hardware, prohibiting the import of various machines and parts into the Liberated Areas. The local source of flower shafts (an important part of the cotton gin) was cut off. I, along with Meng Pengzeng, Wang Xuechen, and other technical workers, began to research and manufacture the machine for making flower shafts—the planer. After the hard work of all the workers in the factory, overcoming various difficulties, we made the current planer. The effect is very good, and it can produce twenty-five flower shafts a day." Regarding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's blockade and control, he said: "Chiang Kai-shek can control the iron industry in the KMT-controlled areas, but the workers in our Liberated Areas can create." Then he led me to another workshop to see the newly assembled lathe. Indeed, their technology is very good. The machine's small parts and body are made very exquisitely, meticulously, and smoothly. If one weren't an "old hand," it would be difficult to tell that it was a "local product." He holds an unshakable belief in the construction and development prospects of various industries in the Liberated Areas. He said: "The Liberated Areas are expanding day by day, and various industrial and commercial constructions are developing day by day, requiring the manufacture of large quantities of lathes, planers, and other machines to supply industrial needs. In the future, I am willing to devote more energy to research in this area." He told me that he is now preparing to find raw materials for manufacturing suction beds (also a type of planer). According to him, if suction beds can be successfully manufactured, parts for various heavy industrial machines can be manufactured. He has sent people to Shijiazhuang to buy tinplate, preparing to improve and enhance the quality of the lathe.
    He told me that he had opened the Longji Iron Factory in Xingjiawan. In 1938, the factory's buildings were burned by the Japanese, and the furniture was looted by the Xu Tieying bandit gang. He said, "I will never forget this disaster and hatred." Then he frankly said that during the great movement the year before last, he saw the masses struggle against the evil gentry and feudal elements, and some industrial and commercial enterprises were also confiscated or had shares withdrawn by the masses. The three waterwheels he had deposited in Yangshi Street were also seized by the masses. At that time, he doubted and was dissatisfied with the policy, and his production mood was depressed. However, government staff constantly came to his shop to comfort and encourage him, helping him solve difficulties. The bank gave him a long-term loan of more than one million yuan to help him develop production. The government also sent people to return his three waterwheels to him. He settled down and managed the business with a free hand.

　　“他能封锁，咱能创造！”
    ——邢台市同诚铁工厂访问记
    董克
    土地法大纲颁布了保护工商业的政策——晋冀鲁豫中央局退还与补偿错斗工商业的指示在邢台具体执行了。邢台市的工商业者们，经营工商业的情绪近来已经完全稳定起来了。经理们开始忙着修理自己的门面，恢复和扩大自己的营业。纳凉园和黎屏市场建筑了一排排崭新的市房，成为两个繁华的市场。人们走过南关每条商业街，都会感觉到一种新生的气象。我在访问同诚铁工厂时，更加深了这种新鲜的感觉。
    同诚是民国三十二年由私人资本开办的铁工厂，当时由于日人多方限制，工厂不能发展。解放后经过民主政府与银行贷款扶助，工人由敌占时的十七人增至二十一人，资本从三万元增至一百六十万元（至去年年底），过去只能制造水车和弹花弓，现在已能自造旋床、刨床等较复杂的机器了。
    经理叫刘闻多。他在十六岁时就当打铁学徒，现在已五十多岁了。当我问到工人们是怎样制造旋床和刨床时，他立即露出胜利的微笑，拉我到工作间去参观那张刨床。他解释制造这部机器的动机和作用说：“去年下半年，蒋匪对五金未施行严密管制，禁止各种机器及零件输入解放区。本地进花轴（弹花机重要零件）来源断绝。我和孟朋增、王学臣等技术工人便开始研究制造进花轴的机器——刨床。经过全厂工人辛苦劳作，克服了各种困难，制成了现在的刨床。效果很好，一天能出二十五根进花轴”。对蒋匪的封锁管制，他说：“蒋介石能管制蒋管区的铁工业，可是咱们解放区的工人能够创造”。接着他又领我到另一工作间去参观那张刚装配好的旋床。的确，他们的技术是很好的。机器的大小零件和机身，都做得很精巧、细致而光滑。如果不是“老在行”，真不容易看出它是一部“土产”。他对解放区各种工业的建设与发展前途，抱着一种坚定不移的信念。他说：“解放区日益扩大，各种工商业建设正日益发展，需要制造大批旋床、刨床等机器，供给工业需要。今后我愿意在这方面多费些精力来研究”。他告诉我，他现在正准备寻找制造吸床（也是一种刨床）的原料。据他说，如果吸床能制造成功，各种重工业机器的零件都可以制造出来。他已派人到石家庄去买洋铁，准备改良与提高旋床的质量。
    他告诉我，他曾在邢家湾开办过隆记铁工厂，民国二十七年，工厂房子被日人烧了，家具被许铁英匪帮抢去了。他说：“我永远忘不了这种灾难和仇恨”。接着他又坦白的说，他在前年大运动时，看到群众斗争奸霸和封建，有些工商业也被群众没收或抽走股金，他寄存在羊市街的三辆水车也被群众扣封了，当时他对政策怀疑不满，生产情绪消沉；但政府工作人员却不断到他柜上安慰鼓励他，帮助他解决困难，银行贷给他一百多万元长期贷款，扶助他发展生产，三辆水车也由政府派人给他送回来，他安心放手的经营起来了。
