Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th:

    The French imperialists are attempting to restore colonial rule in Vietnam. Not only French troops but also Nazi bandits are fighting in the colonial war against the Vietnamese people. The recruitment of German officers and soldiers to form foreign legions was carried out in prisoner-of-war camps in the French-occupied zone of Germany. This legion was later transferred to Vietnam, and it contained 15,000 German soldiers, almost all of whom were young Nazis fostered by Hitler. Most of the French colonial administrative officials in Vietnam are former traitorous Vichy elements. Many Vichy elements have found refuge in Saigon and other cities in Vietnam.

    Military force is not enough to crush a nation fighting for its independence, so the imperialists are plotting to divide its ranks. They are doing this with the help of local feudal aristocrats and reactionary religious leaders who collaborated with the Japanese during the war. They have established puppet governments in Cambodia and Laos. The main political tool used by the French imperialists against Vietnam and its democratic government headed by Ho Chi Minh is the so-called "Vietnam National United Front" (established in Nanjing in 1947, its leader being Lê Văn Hoạch, now a minister without portfolio in Nguyễn Văn Xuân's puppet "Provisional Central Government of Vietnam"). This group claims to oppose the "danger of communism" and is agitating for the return of former Annam King Bảo Đại to Vietnam.

    The colonial war launched by the French ruling clique in Vietnam is not supported by the French people. Even among the French officers and soldiers in Vietnam, many oppose this war fought for the interests of the French two hundred families. Thirty Frenchmen (some of whom were French colonial military officers) wrote a letter to the former French High Commissioner to Vietnam, D'Argenlieu, appealing for peace and freedom for the Vietnamese, and stating that the only way to solve the Vietnam problem is to recognize its independence within the French Union and to stop the war.

    The French colonists in Vietnam, like the Dutch in Indonesia, cannot carry out aggression without the political, military, and financial support of the United States. The aid is not limited to supplying the French colonial army with American weapons. Some time ago, U.S. expansionist envoy Bullitt held talks with Bảo Đại and the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Pignon. Bullitt advocated a more vigorous war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and accelerated negotiations between the French government and Bảo Đại for the restoration of the Annam puppet empire. Military operations have been strengthened. In February and March, the French army launched new large-scale offensives on all fronts in Vietnam, but still made no progress.

    Guerrilla warfare is unfolding throughout Vietnam. Not only in Annam and Tonkin, but even in the Saigon area in the pseudo-Cochinchina Republic (the heartland of French rule), the people's forces are participating in the fight against the aggressors. On March 11, the National Liberation Committee was established in Laos to direct actions against the French army. In a telegram to the Ho Chi Minh government, the committee declared its solidarity with the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On April 16, the Vietnam News Agency reported President Ho Chi Minh's interview with foreign journalists on the war issue. Ho Chi Minh said: "The French army has suffered 60,000 casualties, while thanks to the success of guerrilla tactics, the Viet Minh army has suffered only minor casualties. The French army can only occupy and control some large cities, while all the rest of the territory is mostly occupied by the Viet Minh army and controlled by the democratic government... The Vietnamese people believe in their victory and are prepared to make any sacrifices, and are determined to achieve the complete independence and unity of Vietnam."

　　越南近况
    【新华社陕北十九日电】
    法帝国主义者企图在越南恢复殖民地统治。不仅法国军队而且纳粹匪徒也在反对越南人民的殖民战争中作战。征募德军官兵成立外国军团是在德境法占区战俘营中实行的，该军团后来被调到越南，在该团中有一万五千名德兵，他们几乎都是希特勒豢养的青年纳粹分子。在越南的法国殖民地行政官员，大部分是从前的卖国贼维希分子，许多维希分子在西贡和越南其他城市中找到了避难所。
    武力不足以粉碎一个为其独立而战的民族，帝国主义者遂立图分裂其队伍。他们借助于当地封建贵族及战时与日寇合作的反动宗教领袖们的帮助。他们在柬埔寨与老挝建立了傀儡政府。法帝国主义用以反对越南及其以胡志明为首的民主政府的主要政治工具，便是所谓“越南民族联盟阵线”（按于一九四七年成立于南京，其首魁黎文划，现任阮文春伪“越南临时中央政府”之不管部阁员）。这一集团声言反对“共产主义危险”，并为前安南王保大重返越南而进行煽动。
    法国统治集团在越南发动的殖民地战争，法国人民并不赞成。甚至在越南的法国官兵中，也有许多人反对这一为法国二百家的利益而进行的战争。三十名法国人（其中有一些法国殖民地军官）曾为给越南前高级专员达根留一封信，替越南人呼吁和平和自由，并谓解决越南问题的唯一办法，便是承认它在法国联盟内的独立及停止战争。
    在越南的法国殖民者们，如在印尼的荷兰人一样，没有美国的政治、军事与财政上的支援是不能够进行侵略的。援助并不限于供给法国殖民军以美国武器。若干时以前，美国扩张主义者的特使布立特，与保大及法驻越高级专员波拉埃进行商谈。布立特主张更猛烈地对越南民主共和国作战，并加速法政府与保大间恢复安南傀儡帝国的谈判。军事行动加强了。二三月间，在所有越南各前线上，法军发动了新的大规模攻势，但仍然无任何进展。
    游击战争在全越展开。不仅在安南与东京，甚至在伪交趾支那共和国领土上的西贡地区（按系法国统治的心脏地区），人民的力量都参加了反对侵略者的战斗。三月十一日，在老挝成立了民族解放委员会，以指挥反对法军的行动。在致胡志明政府的电文中，该委员会宣称它与越南民主共和国的人民团结一致。四月十六日，越南民主共和国通讯社报导胡志明总统对外国记者关于战争问题的谈话。胡志明说：“法军死伤六万人，而由于游击战术的成功，越盟军死伤轻微。法军仅仅只能占领与控制若干大城市，而所有其余的领土大都为越盟军据有并为民主政府所控制。……越南人民相信自己的胜利并准备作任何牺牲，且决心实现越南的完全独立与统一。”
