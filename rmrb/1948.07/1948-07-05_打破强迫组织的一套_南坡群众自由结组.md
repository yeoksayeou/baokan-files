Democratic and Voluntary Mutual Aid Combination

　　Breaking the Practice of Forced Organization
    Masses in Nanpo Freely Form Groups
    [Taiyue News] In the mutual aid teams of Nanpo natural village, which belongs to Xiyu in the third district of Yangcheng, the organization was carried out last year according to class composition administrative orders. The mutual aid team leaders were designated by village cadres, and the members were assigned to participate in each group. Mutual aid was just a formality; they were together during meetings, but each did their own work. Although some groups did work together, they were careless about equivalent exchange; some did not keep accounts, saying superficially that it was fine, as long as the work was done, but in reality, everyone was afraid of doing more. Some groups had wages that were too low, usually one and a half sheng of rice per work-day in normal times, and one sheng of rice in winter, so no one was interested in mutual aid. On June 12th, at the night school, the mutual aid organization was reorganized. The village cadres first explained: the past organization of mutual aid in Nanpo was not voluntary, which made the work difficult to carry out and the enthusiasm for production was not high. This reorganization will change the method, first allowing everyone to freely organize and combine, and then electing the team leader. After speaking, he let the masses form groups. The masses raised the opinion, "To be asked to form groups today, everyone is not prepared, and we are afraid that we will not be able to form them well. It is better to go back and let everyone discuss it properly." At this time, the cadres also realized that they were still using an administrative order style, and immediately accepted the opinions of the masses. After two days of free discussion, everyone's opinions were prepared, and on the 14th, group formation was carried out again, with each group consisting of five or six families, and democratically elected those who usually worked well and were fair-minded as the group leader. This voluntary combination excluded some people who did not like to work. Lu Wudui said regretfully, "In the past, I still had a group, but now with free combination, I don't even have a group." Everyone said, "This is true democratic voluntarism!" Wages were also increased to two and a half sheng of rice, regardless of meals. On the 16th, the new mutual aid team arranged the wheat harvesting work, and on the 17th, they began to cut wheat. Everyone's enthusiasm for production increased, and in four days, they completed the cutting of all 534 mu of wheat fields in the village (including threshing). They are now planting carrots and hoeing the second batch of millet seedlings.

　　打破强迫组织的一套
    南坡群众自由结组
    【太岳讯】阳城三区西峪属南坡自然村的互助组，去年按照成份行政命令的组织起来，互助组长由村干部指定，组员听凭分配参加各组。互助只是个形式，开会时在一起，做活却各干各的。有的组虽然互助做活，但是等价交换很马虎，有的不记帐，表面上说没有啥，把活做完就好，实际上谁也怕多做了。有的组工资太低，平时一工一升半米，冬天一升米，谁对互助也不感兴趣。六月十二日夜校上，重新整顿互助组织，村干部先讲明：南坡过去组织互助不是自愿的，弄的工作不好进行，生产劲头不大。这次整顿要改变办法，先由大家自由组织结合，再选组长，说完就让群众编组。群众提出意见说：“今天一下叫结组，大家没有准备，怕还结不好，还是回去好好让大家自己商量着办。”这时干部也觉着自己仍是行政命令的作风，马上接受了群众意见。经过两天的自由商量，大家的意见准备好了，十四日又进行结组，每组五、六家，民主选出平时劳动好的为人公正的当组长。这次自愿结合，过去有些不爱劳动的人就被群众结合掉了。路五堆很后悔的说：“过去咱还有个组，现在自由结合，咱连个组也没有了。”大家却说：“这才是真正的民主自愿哩！”工资也提高到二升半米，不管吃。十六日新互助组布置收麦工作，十七日开始割麦，大家生产劲头提高了，四天工夫就把全村麦地五百三十四亩全部割完（连打场）。现正种红萝卜，锄二遍谷苗。
