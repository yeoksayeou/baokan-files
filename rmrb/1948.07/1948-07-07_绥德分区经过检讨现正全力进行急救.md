　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th. The Suide Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, due to frost damage to summer crops in some areas and serious bureaucratism on the part of the local leadership in disaster relief, saw the disaster situation worsen again in May. Starvation deaths and widespread edema occurred in some areas. Emergency relief efforts are now underway, along with a resolute struggle against bureaucratism. In late May, the Border Region Government dispatched Secretary-General and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Wang Ziyi, to the area to supervise production and disaster relief, and allocated 500 shi of grain for emergency relief. The Suide Sub-district Party Committee also conducted a review and convened a mobilization meeting of over 200 cadres on May 27th. In addition to launching a donation campaign within the sub-district organs, it also dispatched 16 responsible cadres, including the head of the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee, the secretary of the Commissioner's Office, and the director of the sub-district Women's Federation, to various counties to assist in the rescue work. Secretary-General Wang, after inspecting the disaster relief work in the area, stated: The Suide Sub-district suffered extremely heavy damage from the Hu bandits and natural disasters last year. Since last winter, the disaster situation has been the most serious in the entire Border Region. Through the efforts of the Border Region Government in allocating 13,000 shi of grain from last winter to this spring, and the efforts of the cadres and masses in the area, the disaster situation had once been alleviated. However, due to the existence of a purely relief-oriented viewpoint and initial 麻痹 paralysis in the thinking and execution of the local leadership organs, the disaster situation has unfortunately worsened again today. Secretary-General Wang emphasized: In order to enhance the high sense of responsibility of every Party member and cadre for disaster relief, and to truly achieve the goal of saving lives, revolutionary discipline should be strengthened, and personnel who have committed serious mistakes must be severely punished, and if necessary, handed over to the court for trial. Zhang Bangying, Secretary of the Suide Sub-district Party Committee, also made the following review of the sub-district's past disaster relief work: First, there was a disregard for the disaster, with the assumption that the disaster situation would not be as serious as it is today, reflecting the irresponsibility of the sub-district's leadership at all levels and bureaucratism towards the people. For example, Zhenchuan County did not conduct in-depth and specific investigations, initially reporting to the Commissioner's Office that the county had 16,000 disaster victims, but later investigation revealed the actual number to be 40,000. Second, the organization for transporting relief grain was not strict, and it was not transported back in a timely manner, resulting in only 7,000 to 8,000 shi of the 13,000 shi of relief grain reaching the disaster victims, with the remainder being completely consumed and wasted. Third, there was average distribution without focus.

　　绥德分区经过检讨现正全力进行急救
    【新华社西北五日电】陕甘宁边区绥德分区，因部分地区夏田遭冻，以及该地领导机关在救灾中犯了严重的官僚主义，五月间灾情又趋恶化，个别地区并发生饿死人及大批饿肿人的现象，现正全力急救，并与官僚主义进行坚决斗争。边区政府于五月下旬即特派秘书长兼民政厅长王子宜亲赴该区督导生产救灾，并拨粮五百石急救。绥德分区中共地委亦作了检讨，并于五月二十七日召开了二百余干部的动员大会，除在分区机关中展开募捐运动外，又续派地委宣传部长、专署秘书、分区妇联主任等十六名负责干部分赴各县协助抢救工作。兹王秘书长检查该区救灾工作后称：绥德分区因去年遭受胡祸与天灾极重，自去冬开始，灾情即为全边区最严重者。经去冬今春边府拨粮一万三千石及该区干部群众之努力，灾情曾一度减轻；但由于该区领导机关在思想上与执行中存在单纯救济观点和初期漠视灾情的麻痹思想，以致又发生今天灾情转重的现象。王秘书长强调指出：为提高每个党员干部对救灾的高度责任心，真正达到救灾救死的目的，应加强革命纪律，对犯了严重错误的人员必须严厉惩办，必要时交法庭审判。中共地委书记张邦英对分区过去救灾工作亦作了如下检讨：第一、漠视灾荒，以为灾情不会象今天这样严重，表现了分区各级领导对人民不负责任的官僚主义。如镇川县即未作深入具体调查，开始向专署报告该县灾民为一万六千人，但以后一查，实数却是四万人。第二、运救济粮组织不严密，未能按时运回，致一万三千石救济粮只有七八千石分到灾民手中，其余完全被消耗浪费了。第三、无重点的平均发放。
