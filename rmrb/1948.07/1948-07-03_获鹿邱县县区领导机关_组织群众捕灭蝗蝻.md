[North Yue] The leadership organs of Huolu's Eighth District and Qiu County's Li Village area in the Seventh District discovered locust nymphs on the 28th of this month. The situation is most serious in more than ten villages, including Hengshan, Shangzhuang, Dachexing, and Da Xiaolou. The area of grain seedlings in Hengshan Village damaged by locust nymphs accounts for about two-fifths of the entire village. The locust nymphs started as small as wheat grains, grew larger overnight, and quickly developed wings, flying everywhere. Generally, they develop from mountainous areas towards plains. In the locust-affected areas, each village has established a locust-catching headquarters under the Farmers' Association. All villagers, regardless of gender, who are ten years old or older, are locust-catching team members. Every hundred people form a team, and each team is divided into three squads, each equipped with scouts and liaisons. County and district cadres went to each village to supervise and inspect. The entire county has set up a general headquarters, with County Chief Xie personally serving as the general commander of locust catching. In the past few days, many people have participated in locust catching, and the emancipated peasants have played a key role. Wang Shuanggui of Xinzhuang did not sleep for two nights, and some even forgot to eat, putting all their efforts into suppression. It is estimated that all locusts in the county can be completely eliminated within three or four days. Three methods of locust catching have been created: encirclement, sweeping, and variation. The encirclement method is to encircle the areas with more locust nymphs, scatter a piece of wheat straw in the middle, and insert flags as targets. The team members around move towards the target, gradually shrinking the encirclement. Finally, when the locusts all burrow into the wheat straw, light a fire to burn the locusts to death. The sweeping method is used in areas with larger areas and fewer locust nymphs. The entire team members are arranged in a horizontal line and move forward, hitting and eliminating one at a time. The variation method is a mixed application of the above two methods, that is, in the process of sweeping forward, when encountering areas with more concentrated locust nymphs, the scouts insert flags as a signal to change the formation. Depending on the size of the land, part or all of the team is divided to encircle and annihilate them. Burning locust nymphs to death is the best way to eliminate them. If the locust nymphs are buried in the soil, they will slowly crawl out. (Qi Minglu, Zhi Ting, Lü Mingrui)

[Jinan News] Locust nymphs were discovered in some areas of Qiu County, Yongnian, and Daming Counties. Local county and district leadership organs led the masses to quickly capture and eradicate them. Many locust nymphs were simultaneously discovered in the northwest of Hengzhuang Village in the Third District of Qiu County, the east of Li'erzhuang Village in the Fourth District, and the south of Nielou Village on May 29th. The small seedlings that were eaten up or eaten into flower leaves covered about five to six hundred acres. Upon hearing the news, the County Committee immediately organized more than 10,000 people from the Third and Fourth Districts to repeatedly capture and beat them. Most of the locust nymphs have now been eliminated. A large number of flying locusts were found in the reed wasteland with an area of about 50 acres inside the embankment surrounding the southeastern suburbs of Yongnian City. The county chief of the county led all the cadres of the First District and the masses of more than a dozen nearby villages to capture and beat them. On June 12th, four or five patches of locust nymphs were found in the western area of Mazhuang, east of Wantidi in Daming, each patch about one acre in size. District cadres immediately mobilized 130 people to go to capture and beat them. Locust nymphs were also found in the southwest of Mantun Village in the Fourth District of Fudong. The government organized the masses to eliminate them on the one hand, and notified the production committees of each village to conduct inspections everywhere so as to discover them at any time and then eliminate them.

　　获鹿邱县县区领导机关
    组织群众捕灭蝗蝻
    【北岳】获鹿八区大部村庄和七区李家庄一带，于本月二十八日发现蝗蝻。横山、上庄、大车行、大小楼等十余村最为严重。横山村被蝗蝻遭害的谷苗面积，约占全村五分之二。蝗蝻开始只有麦粒那么小，经过一晚上就大些了，很快的长起翅来，遍飞各地。一般是由山地向平川发展。在蝗灾区，各村都在农会下设立捕蝗指挥部，全村不论男女，凡年满十岁者，皆为捕蝗队员，每百人为一队，每队又分三个分队，各队配有侦察和连络员。县区干部分赴各村督促检查。全县设总指挥部，由谢县长亲任捕蝗总指挥。几天来参加捕蝗的人很多，翻身农民起了骨干作用，辛庄王双贵两夜没睡觉，有的连饭也顾不得吃，全力进剿。估计全县蝗虫三、四天内即可全部扑灭。捕蝗办法已创造有包围式，一扫光，变化式三种。包围式是将蝗蝻较多的地方，四面包围起来，当中散一片麦秸；插旗为目标，四周队员向目标前进，包围圈逐渐缩小，最后蝗虫都钻进麦秸里时，点起火来，将蝗虫烧死。一扫光是在面积较大，蝗蝻较少的地方，把全体队员排成一字横队前进，一面行一面打，见一个消灭一个。变化式是上面两种方式的混合施用，即在一扫光的前进中，遇到蝗蝻较集中的地方，即由侦察员插旗为号，变化队形，看地片的大小，分出一部或全部包围歼灭。消灭蝗蝻烧死最好。如果把蝗蝻埋在土里，它会慢慢钻出来。　　　　　　　　　　　　（郄名禄、致庭、吕明瑞）
    【冀南讯】邱县、永年、大名等县部分地区发现蝗蝻，当地县区领导机关率领群众，迅速予以捕灭。邱县三区恒庄村西北，四区里二庄村东、聂楼村南于五月二十九日同时发现蝗蝻甚多，小苗被吃光与吃成花叶的，约有五、六百亩。县委会闻讯，立即组织起三、四区万余群众，反复进行捕打，现蝗蝻大部已被消灭。永年城东南郊围城堤内，约有五十亩面积的芦苇荒地里，发现飞蝗甚多。该县县长当则率领一区全体干部及附近十余村群众进行捕打。大名万堤以东，马庄西部地区于六月十二日发现蝗蝻四、五片，每片约有一亩大，区干立即动员群众一百三十人前往捕打。阜东四区满屯村西南也发现蝗蝻，政府一面组织群众扑灭，一面通知各村生产委员会，到处进行检查，以便随时发现，随即捕灭。
