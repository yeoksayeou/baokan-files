Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th – The news of the People’s Liberation Army capturing Kaifeng has rapidly shaken the financial and commodity markets in Shanghai. U.S. dollars, gold, stocks, rice, and other commodities have all surged in price. According to reports from various foreign news agencies: on the 24th, rice was 15 million (Chiang currency – same below) per dan (unit of weight), on the 25th it had already risen to 17 million per dan, and there was a price but no market. On the 26th, it soared to an astounding 23 million per dan. This is a 22-fold increase compared to the beginning of the year’s 1 million per dan, and about a three-fold increase compared to the beginning of the month’s 6 million per dan. Some other commodities increased by 50% in a single day on the 25th. In the black market, U.S. dollars were 2.6 million Chiang currency per dollar on the 22nd, rising to 2.9 million on the 24th, opening at 3.4 million on the morning of the 25th, and breaking through 4 million that night, soaring to a peak of 5 million on the 26th, a more than 30-fold increase compared to the beginning of the year’s 160,000, and about a four-fold increase compared to the beginning of the month’s 1.05 million. The gold price surge also kept pace with the U.S. dollar, reaching 200 million per tael on the 25th, an increase of 50 million in a single day compared to the 24th. The Shanghai market is now in a state of panic and chaos, "Housewives are frantically selling the rapidly devaluing legal tender (Chiang currency) in their hands, exchanging it for household necessities. Merchants and speculators are scrambling to buy stocks. By noon on the 25th, all stocks had risen to the limit, and stock trading was suspended as a result" (Reuters). "The rapid inflation has made the cost of buying goods rise faster than the selling price, making it unprofitable to trade goods. Some stores have not opened, and shopkeepers try to ask for foreign currency when selling goods, whenever possible" (Associated Press).

According to a report by United Press, the Nanjing market also fell into chaos on the 25th. Most shops closed their doors tightly in the evening to cope with people's panic buying. General commodity prices rose by 10 to 15 percent compared with the previous two days. Paper rose most sharply, about 30 percent, followed by cotton, cloth, soap, rice and flour.

According to Reuters, the primary reason for the increasingly intense economic storm in the Chiang-controlled areas, which began on the 5th of this month, is due to “the continuous stream of unfavorable news from the front lines of the civil war, especially the fall of Kaifeng.” Another factor is the endless vicious expansion of Chiang currency. According to a report in the Chiang Party's army newspaper, Peace Daily, on the 24th, 500,000 and 1 million large denomination bills will be circulated at the beginning of next month. This news immediately affected the market. A United Press reporter quoted the opinion of a Shanghai "banking authority" that the price surge on the 25th was "because all the news - military, political, and economic - is very bad." The same person also said: "No one knows what will happen in the future, because things have reached a point of 'uncontrollable'."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th – According to various reports, commodity prices in major cities in the Chiang-controlled areas have continued to soar since the middle of this month. In Changchun, which was plundered by the Chiang Party, there is a severe shortage of food and skyrocketing prices, "even the price of tree leaves has risen to 200,000 Chiang currency per pound" (United Press Shanghai, 19th). The citizens of Changchun, who are suffering from hunger, have recently launched "several anti-hunger demonstrations, demanding that the food stockpiled by the rich be distributed to the poor" (Associated Press, Beiping, 28th, quoting the Chiang Party's Tianjin Republican Daily). According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas, prices in Tianjin and Beiping are still continuing to soar. In Tianjin, corn flour doubled on the 16th, rising to 50,000 per catty (unit of weight). On the morning of the 18th, Wanshoushan brand flour in Beiping broke through 6 million per bag, and rose to 6.6 million in the afternoon, an increase of 1 million compared to the 17th. On the same day, when Shanghai rice was still 10 million per dan, Beiping rice had already sold for 200,000 per catty (that is, 20 million per dan). According to an Associated Press report, the black market for U.S. dollars in Beiping had risen to 4 million Chiang currency per dollar on the 27th, and in Tianjin it was at least 5 million. The price increase in Qingdao is also very alarming. On June 3rd, U.S. dollars were 1.2 million, and on the 15th, they reached 2 million. Shuanglong fine cloth was only 700,000 per bolt on the 1st, and on the 15th it rose to 11.8 million, an increase of 16 times. By the middle of the month, all commodities had risen by more than 80 percent in half a month. In Xiamen, Fujian, rice had risen to 21 million per dan on the 23rd of this month, and in Fuzhou it had risen to 22 million. Prices in Guangzhou are rising faster than in Shanghai. According to a United Press Shanghai report on the 24th, the Guangdong Kuomintang Senate pointed out, while fiercely criticizing Soong Tzu-wen's malpractices, that "Guangzhou has replaced Shanghai in leading the rise in prices."

　　蒋区市场一片混乱
    沪米涨到二千三百万
    各大城市物价无不狂涨
    【新华社陕北三十日电】人民解放军攻下开封的消息，迅速震撼上海金融物价市场。美钞、黄金、股票、大米及其他物价，无不狂涨。综合各外国通讯社报导：二十四日大米每担为一千五百万元（蒋币——下同），廿五日已涨为一千七百万元，且有价无市。二十六日更涨到每担二千三百万元的惊人记录。即较年初的每担一百万元涨了二十二倍，较月初的每担六百万元涨了约三倍。其他商品有些在二十五日一天之内就上涨了百分之五十。美钞黑市，二十二日每一美元为二百六十万蒋币，二十四日涨至二百九十万，二十五日晨间开盘为三百四十万，入夜即突破四百万元，二十六日更一度涨到五百万元高峰，较年初的十六万元上涨了三十倍强，较月初的一百零五万上涨了约四倍。黄金涨风亦与美钞齐头并进，二十五日每两已涨至两亿元，较二十四日，一日之间即上涨五千万元。现上海市场一片惊惶与混乱，“主妇们慌乱抛售手中迅速贬值的法币（蒋币），换成家用必需品。商人和投机者则争相购买股票，二十五日中午，一切股票皆涨到停板，股票交易曾因之停顿”（路透社）。“飞速的通货膨胀，使买进货物的成本，涨得比卖价还快，已使得买卖商品无利可图。有一些商店就没有开门，店主出卖货物时，只要可能就试要外币”（美联社）。
    又据合众社报导：二十五日南京市场亦曾陷于混乱，大多数商店都于傍晚紧关铺门，以对付人们的抢购，一般物价都较前两日上涨百分之十到十五，以纸张上涨最烈，约达百分之三十，其次为棉花、布匹、肥皂、大米与面粉。
    本月五日开始的蒋区六月经济风暴近日更加猛烈的首要原因，据路透社称：系由“内战前线上不断传来的失利消息，特别是开封的陷落”。另一因素则为蒋币无止境的恶性膨胀。据蒋党陆军机关报和平日报二十四日载称：五十万元与一百万元大钞，将于下月初流通，该项消息立即影响市场。合众社记者引某上海“银行界权威人士”的意见，认为二十五日的物价狂涨，“是因为一切消息——军事的、政治的和经济的，都很坏”。同一人士并说：“谁都不知道以后会发生什么事情，因为事情已到‘无法控制’的地步了。”
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据各方报导：本月中旬以来，蒋区各大城市物价均继续狂涨。蒋党搜括掠夺下的长春，粮食奇缺，物价暴涨，“甚至树叶价格亦已涨到每磅卖二十余万元蒋币”（合众社上海十九日电）。被饥火煎迫的长春市民，最近已掀起“若干次反饥饿示威，要求将富人囤积的粮食分配给穷人”（美联社北平二十八日电引蒋党天津民国日报消息）。另据蒋区报纸消息：平津各地物价仍在继续暴涨中，津市棒子面十六日上涨一倍，每斤已涨到五万元。十八日晨北平万寿山牌面粉每袋已冲破六百万元，下午更涨到六百六十万元，比十七日涨一百万。同日当上海米价尚为每担一千万时，北平大米即已卖到二十万一斤（即每担二千万元）。据美联社报导：二十七日北平美钞黑市已涨到每元合蒋币四百万元，天津则至少要五百万元。青岛物价上涨亦很惊人，六月三日美钞为一百二十万，十五日即达二百万。双龙细布一日仅七十万一匹，十五日即上涨到一千一百八十万元，上涨十六倍之多。至中旬止，半个月内各物均上涨百分之八十以上。福建的厦门，本月二十三日大米每担已涨到二千一百万元，福州更涨达二千二百万元。广州物价涨得比上海还高。据合众社上海二十四日报导，广东国民党参议会在猛烈抨击宋子文的恶政时指出：“广州已代替上海而领导物价上涨”。
