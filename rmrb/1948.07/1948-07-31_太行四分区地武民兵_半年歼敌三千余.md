  　Eliminate Over 3,000 Enemies in Half a Year
    [Taihang Electric Dispatch] The local armed forces of the Taihang Yu-Bei Fourth Military Sub-district, in close coordination with the militia over the past half-year (January to June), have penetrated deep behind enemy lines to take the initiative in combat. They have carried forward the experience of guerrilla warfare from the Anti-Japanese War, and have successfully completed the tasks of protecting grain, safeguarding manpower, and eliminating enemies in the inner lines. In the past half-year, there have been 1,185 battles of all sizes, of which 880 were fought by militia rotation teams and armed work teams, averaging five battles a day. A total of 2,900 Chiang Kai-shek regular army soldiers and local bandits were killed or wounded, and 474 were captured, totaling 3,374 enemies eliminated, accounting for slightly less than 47 percent of the enemy's total force in the sub-district. The following were seized: one mortar, one small cannon, eight light machine guns, one submachine gun, three rifle grenade launchers, 323 rifles and carbines, 65 pistols, four indigenous cannons, 24,664 rounds of ammunition of various types, 38 river boats, and six telephones.
    [Another Electric Dispatch] In a month and a half of wheat protection struggles, the local armed forces of the Fourth Military Sub-district seized 99 rifles and carbines, seven pistols, 41 artillery shells of various sizes, and 4,269 rounds of ammunition. Twenty-three enemy blockhouses and bunkers were destroyed and burned.
