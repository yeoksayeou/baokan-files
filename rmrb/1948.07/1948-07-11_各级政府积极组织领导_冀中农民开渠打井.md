    Ji Zhong Peasants Dig Canals and Wells
    [Ji Zhong News] Peasants in various parts of Ji Zhong are actively engaged in water conservancy construction. In terms of canal construction: Jin藁 County originally planned to complete fourteen branch canals throughout the year, and one-half has been completed this spring, with a total length of 62 *hua li*. Two-fifths of the small branch canals have also been completed. The main canal project has basically been completed. The county also dug a diversion river more than 420 meters long to divert water from the Hutuo River for irrigation. The wheat fields in the villages along the canals, about 4,700 *mu*, have all been irrigated once. The peasants in the villages through which the twenty-two branch canals flow have voluntarily provided more than 20,000 bricks and built forty-nine small sluice gates, expanding the original irrigated area by two-thirds, capable of irrigating 8,000 *mu*. Anxin County has now completed more than 120 *li* of new canals. According to statistics from sixty-nine villages, a total of 100,700 *mu* of land have been irrigated; and six sluice gates have been built. The government has provided 70,000 *jin* of grain to support the peasants in the county to dig canals. The Ji Zhong Public Works Bureau has begun to open a 70-*li* irrigation canal in Ningjin, Ji Zhong, and Ningnan, Ji Nan (the wheat-producing area around ＠kou and Chengbei), diverting water from the Fuyang River and the Xinsha River, which can irrigate more than 58,000 *mu* of land. In terms of well digging: The Ji Zhong Administrative Office organized well-digging work teams to go to the countryside and established water conservancy promotion societies in Anguo, Hejian, and Xinji to fully lead the peasants in digging wells. In coordination with the promotion societies in various counties, well-digging equipment is purchased uniformly and sold to well-digging households for use. Local democratic governments also issue a large number of loans to support them. As of June 10, according to incomplete statistics from twenty-nine counties and cities, 2,659 new wells have been dug and 1,675 broken wells have been repaired. Shulu organized a water conservancy work team, which is leading the masses to launch the "Thousand Wells Movement." Raoyang County plans to complete 500 new wells throughout the year. In some counties where there is no habit of digging wells, the government has organized well-digging work groups to find key areas and villages, and gradually promote it universally. For example, Renqiu has never had the habit of digging wells and suffers from drought every year. Although the government has repeatedly called for digging wells in the past, it has often resulted in perfunctory responses because the leadership did not pay close attention and the masses did not sufficiently understand the benefits of digging wells. This year, the government decided to focus on the third district as the key area and Shicun as the key village, to provide specific assistance, gain experience, and promote it throughout the county. After the well-digging team arrived in Shicun, after propaganda visits, they found that the masses had many concerns about digging wells. Some felt that they did not have money or materials and could not afford to dig, and that government loans could not solve all the problems. Some suspected that if they borrowed public funds, their land would be confiscated if they could not repay them in the future. Some believed that digging wells in this area would not work and that irrigating would make the land "roll" (meaning bad). Some were afraid that digging wells would damage the crops when walking back and forth in the fields. Some were afraid that digging wells would lead to more taxes. Therefore, no one came forward to lead and organize. The well-digging team grasped these situations and used methods such as large and small meetings and individual talks to publicize the benefits of digging wells, the loan regulations, the intentions of the well-digging team, and the collection methods, etc., gradually dispelling the masses' ideological concerns. Then, a group of backbone activists were discovered, who influenced others, forming a well-digging craze in the village. Currently, nine new and repaired wells have been completed, and four waterwheels have been purchased. Under the influence of the village, nearby villages have also begun to dig wells. As of now, thirty-eight new and repaired old wells have been completed in the third district. As the well-digging work achieved results, peasants in various places purchased a large number of waterwheels. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-nine counties and cities, 2,131 new waterwheels have been added and 3,090 old waterwheels have been repaired. Xinle County alone purchased and repaired more than 990 vehicles. Xiangqu Village in the fourth district of the county converted the undistributed floating wealth into funds and combined it with some private capital to buy forty-one waterwheels. Currently, peasants in various places are seizing the favorable season for digging wells after the wheat harvest and continuing to carry out the well-digging movement.

　　各级政府积极组织领导
    冀中农民开渠打井
    【冀中讯】冀中各地农民积极进行水利建设。在开渠方面：晋藁县原计划全年完成十四道支渠，今春已完成二分之一，全长六十二华里。小支渠也完成了五分之二。干渠工程基本上已经完成。该县并挖掘长四百二十多米的引河一道，引滹沱河水浇地。渠道所属村庄的麦田约四千七百余亩，都普遍浇过一遍。二十二个支渠流经的村庄，农民自动出砖二万多块，建立了四十九个小闸，扩大原有浇地面积三分之二，能浇地八千亩。安新县现已完成新渠一百二十余里，据六十九个村庄统计，共浇地十万零七百余亩；并修成水闸六个。政府曾贷粮七万斤，扶植该县农民开渠。冀中工务局已着手在冀中宁晋及冀南宁南地区（＠口、城北一带之产麦区），开一道七十余里的灌溉渠，引滏阳河、新沙河水，可灌溉五万八千余亩土地。在打井方面：冀中行居组织了打井工作队下乡，并在安国、河间、辛集成立了水利推进社，全力领导农民打井。配合各县推进社统一购买打井器材，卖给各打井户使用。各地民主政府也大量发放贷款扶植。截至六月十日，据二十九个县、市不完全统计，已打新井二千六百五十九眼，修理坏井一千六百七十五眼。束鹿组织了水利工作队，正领导群众开展千眼井运动。饶阳全县计划全年完成五百眼新井。在若干没有打井习惯的县份，政府组织了打井工作组，找出重点区村，逐渐普遍推广。如任邱向来没有打井习惯，每年都闹荒旱，过去政府虽不断号召打井，但由于领导上抓的不紧，群众对打井的好处又认识不足，往往形成应付。今年政府决定以三区为重点区，以史村为重点村，具体帮助，取得经验，推广全县。打井组到了史村，经过宣传访问，发现群众对打井顾虑很多，有的觉得没钱没材料，打不起，政府贷款不一定能全部解决问题。有的怀疑贷了公家款，将来给不了就没收地。有的认为这个地区打井不行，浇来浇去会把地浇滚了（坏的意思）。有的怕打了井，来往在地里走，糟蹋了庄稼。有的怕打了井征收多。因此没有人出头领导与组织。打井组掌握了这些情况，便以大小会议和个别谈话等方式宣传打井的好处，贷款的条例，打井组的来意和征收办法等等，逐步打通了群众的思想顾虑。接着发现了一批骨干积极分子，由他们影响别人，在该村形成打井热潮，现已新开和修理了九眼井，买了四辆水车。在该村影响下，附近各村也开始打井，截至目前，三区已打成新井与修好旧井三十八眼。打井工作获得成绩，各地农民即大量购买水车，据二十九个县、市不完全统计，已添新水车二千一百三十一辆，修理旧水车三千零九十辆。只新乐一县，就购买和修理了九百九十多辆。该县四区庠曲村，将未分的浮财变款，结合一部私资，买了四十一辆水车。现各地农民正抓紧麦收后打井的有利季节，继续开展打井运动。
