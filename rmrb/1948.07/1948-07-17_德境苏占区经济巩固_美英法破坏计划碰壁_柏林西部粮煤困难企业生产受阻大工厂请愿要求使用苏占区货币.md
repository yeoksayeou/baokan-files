　　Economic Consolidation in the Soviet Zone of Germany
　　US, British, and French Sabotage Plans Thwarted
　　Food and Coal Shortages in West Berlin; Business Production Hampered; Large Factories Petition to Use Soviet Zone Currency
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th】Reports from various sources indicate that the US, British, and French reactionaries' actions to sabotage the Berlin economic system are facing increasing setbacks. On June 23rd, the US, British, and French authorities in Germany implemented the West German "Kreditmark" in West Berlin, prohibiting people from exchanging currency or trading with the Soviet zone. This severed the connection between the West Berlin occupation zone and other areas using the Soviet zone Mark, not only plunging the 2.5 million residents of West Berlin into severe shortages of food, coal, and electricity, but also backfiring on the US, British, and French occupation forces, causing difficulties in supplying food and coal. According to a US official spokesperson, West Berlin's food reserves can only sustain rations until September 1st, and coal supplies can only last for 28 days. As for electricity, usage was reduced by a quarter two weeks ago, and now it can only be supplied for four hours a day. Under these circumstances, more than a hundred enterprises in West Berlin have been unable to operate for a full week, with many only working 24 hours per week; the number of unemployed workers has now exceeded 100,000. To oppose the use of the disastrous "Kreditmark," delegations from major factories in Berlin went to the city hall to petition, demanding the use of the same currency as the Soviet zone in West Berlin. The chairman of the Berlin City Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, Ma Tun, also called for unifying the currencies of Berlin and the Soviet zone. Due to the pressure of the situation, some leaders of the Berlin city government, who are colluding with the US, British, and French, have had to change their attitude. Therefore, on the 7th, the city government unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Mark circulating in the Soviet zone be used as the legal currency generally used in the greater Berlin area.
　　Under these unfavorable circumstances, the commanders-in-chief of the US, British, and French occupation forces visited Marshal Sokolovsky, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces, on the 3rd, seeking to open up land transportation between Berlin and the western occupation zones. Marshal Sokolovsky replied that the railway lines from Berlin to West Germany were still under repair. Marshal Sokolovsky emphatically stated that in view of the western occupying authorities' implementation of separate currency reforms and other measures aimed at undermining the economy of the Soviet zone, the Soviet military authorities consider it their sacred duty to protect the 20 million German residents of the Soviet zone and the economy of the Soviet zone.

　　德境苏占区经济巩固
    美英法破坏计划碰壁
    柏林西部粮煤困难企业生产受阻大工厂请愿要求使用苏占区货币
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方报导：美英法反动派破坏柏林经济体系的行动正步步碰壁。六月二十三日，德境美英法当局在柏林西部实施西德实行的“克莱马克”，禁止人民向苏占区兑换货币或进行贸易。这样，便使柏林西部占区与使用苏占区马克的其他地方的联系断绝，不仅柏林西部二百五十万居民陷入粮食与煤电奇缺的苦境中，甚至美英法占领军亦作茧自缚，致粮煤供应发生困难。据美国官方发言人称：柏林西部占区存粮仅可维持配给至九月一日，煤的供应则仅能维待二十八天。至于电力使用，在两周前已减少四分之一，现则每日仅能供应四小时。在这种情形下，柏林西部占区已有一百多个企业不能整周开工，其中许多企业每周只能工作二十四小时；失业工人现已超过十万人。为反对使用带来灾难的“克莱马克”，柏林各大工厂代表团曾赴市政府请愿，要求在柏林西部占区使用与苏占区同一的货币。统一社会党柏林市委会主席马吞，也呼吁统一柏林与苏占区的货币。由于情势所迫，与美英法勾结的柏林市政府的某些首领们，也不得不改变态度。因此，市政府于七日一致通过决议，要求以苏占区流通的马克作为大柏林市区通用的合法货币。
    在这种不利形势下，美英法占领军总司令乃于三日同往谒见苏军总司令索柯洛夫斯基元帅，企求打开柏林与西部占领区之间的陆上交通。索帅答称：从柏林通往西德的铁路线尚在修理中。索帅着重声明：在西部占领当局实行单独货币改革并采取其他旨在破坏苏占区经济措施的情况下，苏军当局认为保护苏占区二千万德国居民以及苏占区经济，乃是苏军当局的神圣职责。
