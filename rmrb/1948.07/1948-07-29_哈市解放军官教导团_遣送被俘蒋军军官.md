When the PLA Officer Training Corps released them, each person was given ample travel expenses, and all belongings deposited upon joining the corps were returned. Zhang Rongru, Colonel Deputy Adjutant of the 53rd Army, said gratefully upon receiving the ivory seal and documents, etc., that the corps had kept safe for him: "You are truly so considerate, I never thought that even such small items would be kept safe for me until today."
