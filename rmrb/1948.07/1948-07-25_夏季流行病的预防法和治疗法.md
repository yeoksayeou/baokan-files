　　Prevention and Treatment of Summer Epidemics
    Wang Gang
    The weather is now hot, and mosquitoes and flies are at their peak, leading to widespread prevalence of various epidemics such as malaria and bacillary dysentery. Although our environmental sanitation is not yet modern, if everyone pays attention to personal hygiene, we can reduce the incidence of disease. Here is a brief overview of several common summer diseases:
    (1) Malaria: Commonly known as "da bai zi" or "fa nue zi," it is caused by a type of mosquito that bites a person with malaria, sucks blood containing malaria parasites, and then bites other healthy people, indirectly transmitting the disease.
    Prevention methods: A. Eliminate mosquitoes by removing stagnant water pits to prevent larval breeding. B. Use mosquito nets to avoid mosquito bites. C. Isolate malaria patients to prevent them from being bitten by mosquitoes. Treatment: Patients who have already experienced an attack do not need treatment during the attack. After the attack subsides, take quinine orally, 0.5 each time, three times a day for five consecutive days, or use yellow malaria pyrimidine tablets, two tablets three times a day for three consecutive days. Injection method: Inject saline quinine solution intravenously two hours before the attack.
    (2) Bacillary Dysentery: Commonly known as dysentery, it is divided into bacterial and amoebic types. Bacterial dysentery is more common in the summer. It is caused by flies that contaminate food with bacillary dysentery bacteria, which attach to the food and are ingested, leading to the disease. Prevention methods: Eliminate flies, use bamboo curtains and oiled cloth to prevent flies from entering the kitchen or dining room, cover cooked food with cloth, wrap tableware to prevent flies from crawling on it, do not drink raw cold water, and do not eat raw vegetables or cold food. Thoroughly disinfect the feces of dysentery patients, or cover them with lime and dry soil to prevent flies from crawling on them. Treatment: First, use saline laxatives to clear the intestinal contents, abstain from food for 24 hours, drink plenty of water, take bone charcoal kaolin orally, or use 50% magnesium sulfate (or 33% sodium sulfate solution) every four hours in doses of 2000 until cured. Sulfaguanidine is also effective.
    (3) Cholera: It is caused by cholera bacteria that contaminate food and drink, leading to the disease. It is a terrible infectious disease that can cause death in a few hours. Symptoms: Sudden vomiting and diarrhea, cold limbs, rice-water stool, sunken eye sockets and abdomen, dry skin, weak pulse, dehydration, collapse, and painful cramps in the calf muscles. Prevention methods: Same as for bacillary dysentery. Preventive vaccines can be injected. Treatment: Rest, use cardiac stimulants, keep warm, and inject physiological saline.
    (4) Enteritis: Commonly known as diarrhea, it is caused by unclean food, food poisoning, or abdominal cold. Symptoms: Diarrhea, loose or watery stools, containing mucus, abdominal pain, two to three or even ten or more bowel movements per day. Prevention methods: Do not eat raw or cold food, cover well with blankets at night to prevent abdominal cold. Treatment: Abstain from food for 24 hours, take a laxative to cleanse the intestines. If diarrhea persists, take astringents such as tincture of opium.
    [Attached] Infantile Indigestion: Often occurs in summer, caused by bacterial infection or dietary imbalance. Symptoms include diarrhea with foamy mucus discharge, abdominal distension, vomiting, fever, and green stools and milk curds in infants. Prevention methods: Do not give children raw, cold, or unclean food, and do not drink cold water. Treatment: Breastfeed every four hours, reducing the amount each time. In severe cases, abstain from food for one day and drink plenty of water. First use a laxative to cleanse the intestines, then use S.T. and other antiseptic disinfectants. Do not use astringents.
    (5) Heatstroke: People working in high heat and humidity, or marching in hot weather, can develop heatstroke. Symptoms can be divided into the following two types:
    A. Heat Exhaustion: Symptoms include general weakness, dizziness, confusion, pale complexion, profuse sweating, little urine, difficulty breathing, rapid pulse, low blood pressure, sometimes spasmodic pain in the abdomen and limbs, cold and clammy skin, but elevated rectal temperature. Most patients with this condition can recover, but some may die from heart failure. B. Heatstroke: Caused by excessive dysfunction of the body's temperature regulation mechanism. Patients develop the condition suddenly and may die immediately. Most patients first experience headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, and nausea. Later, they become unconscious, with a flushed face, dry skin, and fever. In severe cases, the body temperature rises to 42-43 degrees Celsius. If they can survive until the second day, they can be cured. Prevention methods: In hot summer weather, wear a straw hat or cover your head with a towel soaked in cold water when walking, and drink plenty of water. If you feel uncomfortable, find a shady place to rest. Treatment: (1) Patients with heat exhaustion should be quickly moved to a shady place, loosen clothing, and rest slightly to recover. In severe cases, stimulant cardiac agents should be injected. (2) For heatstroke, treatment should be given immediately with a cold water bath or cold water enema until the body temperature reaches below 39 degrees Celsius. The heart should be carefully monitored, and cardiac stimulants should be given immediately if there are signs of heart failure. If there are symptoms of pulmonary congestion, phlebotomy may be performed.

　　夏季流行病的预防法和治疗法
    王钢
    现在天气炎热，蚊蝇最多，因此各种流行病，如疟疾、赤立肠炎等流行甚广。我们环境卫生不能现代化，但如果大家能注意个人卫生，疾病也能减少。兹将夏季流行的数种疾病简述如下：
    （一）疟疾：俗名打摆子或发疟子，原因是一种疟蚊咬了患疟疾病的人吸了含有疟原虫的血液，又咬了其他健康人，间接传染疾病。
    预防方法：Ａ、灭蚊，将死水坑除掉不使幼虫繁殖。Ｂ、挂蚊帐以免蚊咬。Ｃ、隔离患疟疾病人不被蚊咬。治疗法：已发作之病人不必治疗，待发作过去后内服奎宁每次０．５，一日三次连服五天，或用黄色疟涤平片，每日三次每服二片，连服三天。注射法：于发作前两小时用盐奎注射液静脉注射。
    （二）赤痢：俗名痢疾，分细菌性和阿米巴性两种，夏季流行多为细菌性，原因是饮食被污染赤痢杆菌之苍蝇爬过将病菌附着于食物上，吞下后引起之疾病。预防法：灭蝇，用竹帘糊冷布以防蝇侵入厨房或饭厅，做好饭用布盖好，食器包好不使蝇爬，不饮生冷水不吃生菜冷饭。赤痢病人大便严密消毒，或用石灰干土盖好避免蝇爬。治疗法：先用盐类泻药清除肠内容，绝食廿四小时，多饮水，内服骨炭白陶土，或用５０％硫酸镁（或３３％硫酸钠水）间四小时服２０００到治愈为止，磺胺胍亦有确效。
    （三）霍乱：原因是一种霍乱菌由蝇污染饮食物使人发病，为一种可怕的传染病，数小时死亡。症状：突然上吐下泻四肢发冷，排泄米汤样便，眼窝及腹部塌陷，皮肤干燥，脉搏细小，呈脱水状况，陷于虚脱腓肠肌痛疼痉挛。预防法：同赤痢，可以注射预防疫苗。治疗法：安静用强心剂，保温，注射生理食盐水。
    （四）肠炎：俗名泻肚，原因为饮食不洁，食物中毒，腹部寒冷。症状：腹泻大便稀软或为水样液体，含有粘液，有腹痛者，每日大便二三次至十数次。预防法：不吃生冷食物，夜晚盖好被子，不使腹部受凉。治疗法：绝食二十四小时，服泻剂清肠，如果腹泻不止，可服收敛剂阿片酊等。
    【附】小儿消化不良：多发生于夏季由细菌感染或食量失调所引起。症状为下痢排泄物有泡沫粘液，腹胀，呕吐，发热，乳儿有绿便及奶瓣。预防法：不给小儿生冷不洁食物，不饮冷水。治疗法：每间四小时哺乳一次减量，重症绝食一日，多饮水。先用泻剂清肠，然后用Ｓ·Ｔ·等防腐消毒剂，不可用收敛剂。
    （五）中暑：在高热及湿度过高之空气中工作之人，暑天行军走路皆可发生中暑，症状可分下列二种。
    Ａ热竭：症状为全身无力、头晕，神识不清、面色苍白、大汗尿少，呼吸困难、脉搏频、血压下降，有时腹部及四肢有痉挛性痛疼，皮肤冷湿，但直肠温度增高。患此病者大多数可以恢复，但亦有因心力衰竭而死亡者。Ｂ中暑：因病人体温调节机能过度失调所致。病人突然发病有立即死亡者。多数病人先觉头痛头晕眼花作呕。以后昏迷不醒，面色发红，皮肤干燥，发热。病重时体温至四十二三度。如能延至第二日可以治愈。预防法：夏季正炎热，走路带草帽或用手巾沾冷水盖头部，多饮水。自觉不舒服时，找荫凉处休息。治疗法：（一）患热竭者速移至荫凉处松开衣服稍加休息即可复原，重者须注射兴奋强心剂。（二）中暑，应速治疗立即给以冷水浴或用冷水灌肠，直至体温至三十九度以下。心脏最应注意，如有心力衰竭时，立予强心剂，如有肺充血症状时，可行静脉放血术。
