Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 2nd. Recently, infectious diseases have occurred in this area following the famine. In Yan Village, Guoxian County, more than 400 people have contracted typhoid fever, and more than 60 have died. In other areas, many have died from acute gastroenteritis. The investigation revealed that the causes were: long-term starvation caused by the famine, weakened bodies, and reduced resistance; or eating poisonous grass roots; or overeating after the summer harvest. To this end, the Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office and the Military Region Headquarters jointly issued an order on the 20th of last month to all commissioners, military sub-district commanders, political commissars, and health agencies, to immediately begin organizing the treatment of diseases among the disaster victims, in order to further improve the disaster relief and life-saving work. The order stipulates: (1) Each administrative office and military sub-district should immediately organize the health agencies, hospitals, midwifery clinics, and health departments of the stationed military units within their respective jurisdictions, and dispatch personnel to form mobile medical teams based on the work situation and the severity of the disaster in the local area, and carry medicines to the severely affected areas for treatment. (2) The health departments of each military sub-district, all hospitals, all sanatoriums, and the health departments of the stationed military units should treat the sick disaster victims passing through their areas with a high degree of responsibility to the people. In addition, they should try their best to dispatch personnel to participate in the treatment teams. In districts and towns with medical cooperatives, doctors and medicines should be organized to go to the countryside to serve the masses. (3) All medical and drug expenses for treating disaster victims shall be waived. The required medicines shall be paid by the health departments and reimbursed uniformly. (4) While providing treatment, various health knowledge should be promoted to the masses. Due to the extreme difficulty in obtaining medicines, all doctors going to the countryside should organize rural doctors to collect proven effective prescriptions from the masses and promote them. (5) Each administrative office and military sub-district must summarize the work of each health department and each mobile medical team for evaluation.

    行署军区联合命令组织医生紧急治疗
    【新华社晋绥二日电】此间近日已继灾荒发生传染玻崞县阎庄行政村患伤寒病者达四百余人，死亡六十余人，其他各地患急性肠胃炎而死者亦不少。据查原因，为灾荒所造成之长期饥饿，身体衰弱，抵抗力减低；或吃了毒性草根；或夏收后的暴食所致。为此，晋绥边区行署及军区司令部特于上月廿日向各专员、各分区司令员、政治委员、各卫生机关发布联合命令，即刻着手组织对灾民的疾病治疗工作，以便进一步做好救灾救死工作。命令规定：（一）各专署、分区应即组织现驻本分区境内之卫生机关、医院、术生所及驻军机关之卫生部门，抽调人员，依据工作状况及当地灾情组织巡回治疗小组，携带药品派往灾情严重地区进行治疗工作。（二）各分区卫生部门各医院各休养所各地驻军机关之卫生部门，对驻地附近过路之有病灾民均须以高度为人民负责精神予以治疗。此外，并须尽量抽派人员参加治疗小组。有医药合作社的区镇，应即组织医生药材下乡为群众服务。（三）治疗灾民疾病，一律免收医药费，所需医药由各卫生部门支出后统一报销。（四）与治疗同时应向群众宣传各种卫生常识。由于医药万分困难，各下乡医生应组织农村医生收集群众中证明有效之单方予以推广。（五）各专署分区对各卫生部门各巡回医疗组工作，须做出总结，以便考核。
