　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 27th. According to a revelation in the Qingdao Minbao on July 30th: The entire automotive industry in Qingdao went on strike on June 29th to protest the Chiang Kai-shek authorities' monopoly on gasoline and their vicious exploitation through high prices. The Kuomintang's official gasoline company completely controls the city's gasoline supply, refusing to supply the general automotive needs of Qingdao, and taking the opportunity to reap huge profits by selling large quantities of gasoline on the black market at a high price of 1.3 million yuan per gallon (the official price is 850,000 yuan per gallon). Therefore, most car owners were forced to purchase gasoline on the black market at high prices, and subsequently held a strike to protest.

　　抗议蒋当局垄断汽油青岛汽车业罢市
    【新华社华东二十七日电】据青岛民报七月三十日揭露：青岛全市汽车业为抗议蒋当局垄断汽油，高价牟利的凶恶剥削，于六月二十九日全体举行罢市。该市蒋党官办汽油公司全部统治着该市汽油来源，拒绝供给青岛一般汽车需用，而乘机牟取暴利，将大量汽油以每加仑一百三十万元之高价售于黑市（官价则为每加仑八十五万元），故一般车主均被迫只能以高价求购黑市汽油，遂举行罢市抗议。
