The ordinary class absorbs labor models and district-level cadres with rich production experience to train agricultural and forestry technology extension personnel and middle-sized farm seedling cadres, etc. The preparatory class enrolls intellectuals with secondary education levels to train agricultural and forestry technicians. The study period is tentatively set for six months to one year, and enrollment has already begun. The first phase of enrollment for the industrial and commercial cadre school is set at 300 students. Those with a junior high school education level or who have worked in companies, shops, factories, salt affairs, tax collection and other agencies for more than two years and have considerable technical skills can apply for the exam.
