　　Correspondence
    No. 2
    To the responsible comrades of the First and Second Districts of Lingshou, and the Fourth District of Fuping: According to a manuscript from the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Administrative Office, many villages in your three districts suffered severe hail damage in May and June. The government immediately allocated grain to help the affected people replant. We hope you will report the details of the replanting situation as soon as possible.

    To the responsible comrades of Yangqu County: According to a manuscript from the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Administrative Office, some cadres in your county mechanically applied the ideological methods and work requirements of "satisfying poor and hired peasants" from the land reform in leading mass production, and put forward the erroneous slogan of "Poor peasants go fast, middle peasants wait a while." In organizing labor exchange, they one-sidedly emphasized "mutual aid" while neglecting voluntariness and equal value. A labor exchange group in Lian Dian Village is responsible for 120 mu of "mutual aid land" (please explain in detail what form this "land" takes to implement "mutual aid"). If this situation is true, is it an isolated district or village, or is it more widespread? Please report in detail on your investigation and correction process regarding this issue.

    Comrades Zheng Bang and Xiu De of the Fifth District of Shouyu: We hope you will continuously report on the specific experiences of your district's cadres after the meeting, on how to improve the "administrative coercion" in organizing labor exchange.

    To Comrades Li Yimin, Li Jingbo, and Liu Jian of the First Special District of Beiyue: We have received the two manuscripts sent earlier, "Hunyuan Chengguan Flood Control Dam" and "The First Special District Vigorously Repairs Water Conservancy," but the figures cited in the two manuscripts (project plan, stone used, labor used, funds used, etc.) differ greatly. Please provide a complete report on the entire construction process of the dam.

    Comrade Zhao Sheng San: We have received your draft letter to Yang Hongxun, but it does not specify which county and village you and Yang belong to. Please inform us promptly.

　　通讯往来
    第二号
    灵寿一、二区，阜平四区负责同志：据行署农林厅来稿、你们三个区有不少村庄，曾在五、六月间遭受严重雹灾，政府当即拨粮扶助受灾群众补种。希速将补种情形详细报导。
    阳曲县负责同志：据行署农林厅来稿：你县有些干部在领导群众生产中，曾机械的搬用在土改中“满足贫雇农”的思想方法与工作要求，并提出“贫农快快走，中农等一等”的错误口号；在组织拨工中，则片面的强调“互助”而忽视自愿等价。连巅村有个变工组就负担着一百二十亩“互助地”（这种“地”采用何种形式实行“互助”，请详细说明。）此种情况如系实情，是个别区村，还是较普遍的？即请你们对此问题的检查及纠正过程，作详细报导。
    寿榆五区政邦、修德二同志：希将你区干部会后，如何改进在组织变工中“行政强制”的具体经验，连续报导来。
    北岳一专署李毅民、李静波、刘健三同志：前后寄来之“浑源城关防洪坝”与“一专区大力修复水利”两稿均收到，但两稿所举数字（工程计划，用石，用工、用款等）大有出入。请再把该坝全部修建过程，做一完整报导。
    赵盛三同志：你给杨鸿勋的信稿收到，但未写明你及杨各系何县何村人，请迅告。
