　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army used on-the-spot Party admission in the battle of Lalatun, southeast of Changchun, to promote an army-wide upsurge in support of the Party, thereby creating a completely new atmosphere in the company.

　　Before the Lalatun battle on May 24th, the political commissar of the regiment announced the higher authorities' call for on-the-spot Party admission. When the troops stopped pursuing and awaited orders on the front line, the company political instructor of the 10th Company immediately called on the platoon and squad cadres to report their battle achievements. It was discovered that Yin Wenxuan, a soldier of the 9th Squad of the 3rd Platoon who had previously requested to join the Party, had performed outstandingly in this battle. After working with the deputy squad leader and soldiers in his group to eliminate the enemy's bunker and capture twelve prisoners, he charged into the courtyard alone. After the branch and the commendation committee reviewed Yin Wenxuan's daily work and pre-battle determination, they believed that he met the requirements for Party membership and immediately announced the approval of his on-the-spot Party admission at a general meeting of soldiers of the entire company, which was unanimously supported by the soldiers. Other companies in the battalion were also very excited when they heard the news.

　　Before the battalion carried out on-the-spot Party admission, the company branch had openly held Party Days (one day per week was designated for educating Party members or conducting group activities) during the military rectification movement, so that non-Party soldiers and Party member soldiers could attend Party lessons together. The branch also specifically assigned Party members to contact non-Party members and cultivate candidates for Party membership. The Party's prestige in the company was extremely high; non-Party members generally yearned to join the Party, but many were concerned that their own conditions were not sufficient and were unwilling to make a public expression. After Yin Wenxuan's on-the-spot Party admission, everyone's confidence immediately increased. For a time, a warm atmosphere of supporting the Party was created throughout the battalion. 174 people signed up to request on-the-spot Party admission, 68 people were determined to become combat heroes, and 38 people were determined to become solo heroes. Now, the soldiers are no longer satisfied with battlefield commendations, but regard being a Communist Party member on the front line as the supreme honor.

　　After this movement was launched throughout the entire unit, it raised the consciousness of Party members, promoted a wave of competition among soldiers, and generally formed a conscious and spontaneous work style in the company. Alternate Party member Sun Xiangyi was determined to surpass Yin Wenxuan's battle achievements in the next battle. Jiang Xuefeng, a model Party member of the 8th Company, became the target of everyone's challenge, and everyone regarded him as the standard for on-the-spot Party admission. At the same time, the soldiers also realized that to be admitted to the Party on the front line, it was not only necessary to have courage in battle, but also to have skills and excellent work performance in peacetime. Therefore, during wartime, they automatically dug fortifications, built bunkers, came up with ideas, seized gaps to automatically train troops, and practiced siege warfare; in peacetime, they competed to stand guard, actively helped each other, and the relationship between officers and soldiers was closer than before, and the spirit of class friendship was greatly developed. Currently, the company is organizing on-the-spot Party members into groups, with the group leader responsible for individual education, conducting reviews every week, and specifically helping them to progress and meet the requirements for Party membership.

    用火线入党的方式推动全军拥党热潮
    【新华社东北八日电】解放军某部在长春东南之拉拉屯战斗中，以火线入党的方式推动了全军拥党的热潮，连队气象因而焕然一新。
    该部某营于五月二十四日拉拉屯战斗前，由团政委宣布了上级关于火线入党的号召。当部队停止追击在火线待命时，十连连指导员即号召班排干部汇报战功，发现过去要求入党的三排九班战士尹文铉在这次战斗中，于协同副班长和本组战士解决敌人地堡、俘十二名后，又只身冲入大院，战绩优异。支部和评功委员检查了尹文铉平日的工作和战前决心，认为符合入党条件，当即在全连军人大会上宣布批准他火线入党，当获军人大会一致拥护。该营其他连队闻讯后，也都十分兴奋。
    该营未进行火线入党前，在整军运动中连队支部即曾公开举行党日（每周规定一日，进行对党员的教育或小组活动等），使非党员战士和党员战士在一起上党课；支部并具体分配党员联系非党员，培养发展党员的对象。在连队里党的威信极高；非党员，一般都渴望入党，但多顾虑自身的条件不够，不愿作公开表示。尹文铉火线入党后，立即增加了大家的信心。一时全营造成了热烈的拥党空气，报名要求火线入党的有一百七十四人，决心做战斗英雄的有六十八人，做独胆英雄的有三十八人。现战士们已不满足于战场记功，而以能在火线上作一个共产党员为无上光荣。
    这一运动在整个部队中开展后，提高了党员的自觉精神，推动了战士之间的竞赛热潮，普遍形成连队中自觉、自动的作风。候补党员孙相倚决心在下次战斗中超过尹文铉的战功；八连模范党员姜学风成为大家挑战的对象，大家都以他作为火线入党的标准。同时，战士们并认识到要火线入党，不仅凭着战时的勇敢，而且还要有技术以及平时优良的工作成绩。因此在战时自动挖工事，修地堡，想办法，抓住空隙自动练兵，演习攻坚战；在平时则互争站岗，积极互助，官兵关系亦较前密切，阶级友爱的精神大为发挥。目前连队对于火线入党的战士进行编组，由小组长负责个别教育，每星期进行检讨，具体帮助他们进步，达到入党的条件。
