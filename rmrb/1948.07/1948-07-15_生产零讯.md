             Dong Changzhen Military Family Textile Production Overcomes Famine
    △ Dong Changzhen in Wutai is a village severely affected by drought. Gan, a poor military serviceman's family member and martyr's family member, organized with the help of the disaster relief agency to overcome the famine. Twenty-one people were divided into three groups. Two groups stayed at home, spinning yarn and managing household affairs, while the other group of seven specialized in textile production. They received cotton from the disaster relief agency and bought a batch of wool with a loan to actively engage in spinning. Soon, using the profits and some private funds, they bought a sock knitting machine. Initially, no one knew how to operate it, so one person was selected from the group to learn sock knitting techniques at the disaster relief agency. After mastering the skills, everyone provided yarn, and he knitted socks. In the past three months, they have made significant profits. Recently, after deducting food and other expenses, each person received a dividend of 40,000 yuan (border currency).
            Wang Shuiquan Mutual Aid Group – Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations for Profit
    △ The mutual aid group led by Wang Shuiquan in Xiemazhang, Wutai, consists of five people, including three poor peasants and two middle peasants, with five donkeys. From the beginning, they combined agriculture and sideline occupations. All manpower and animal power were divided into two groups: an agricultural group of three people and two donkeys, and a transportation group of two people and three donkeys, engaged in agriculture and transportation respectively. After the agricultural group finished sowing all 74 mu of land for the whole group, they all combined to engage in transportation. Using the original 1 million yuan (border currency) loan as capital, starting from April 12th, they bought 300 jin of oat flour in Tai and sold it in Nieying, earning a net profit of 480,000 yuan. After Ying County was captured by us, they went there to transport salt, and it is estimated that they can earn a profit of 1 million yuan in a month. In this way, their food for both people and animals can be solved. (Xu Huaming)
