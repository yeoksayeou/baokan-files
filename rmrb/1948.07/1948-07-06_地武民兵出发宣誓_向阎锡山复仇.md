Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 2nd. "Revenge on Yan Xishan!" This sorrowful and indignant slogan has spread throughout the local armed forces of Jinzhong heading towards the Yan-occupied areas. Before their departure, a certain militia cadre unit specially set up a memorial altar to mourn the parents, brothers, and sisters who died under Yan's bandit "self-confession and rebirth" atrocities. Zhang Zhenji walked to his father's memorial tablet and only said one sentence: "Father, you died so unjustly!" Tears welled up in his eyes, and he couldn't stop crying. Fifty-two children of martyrs successively took the stage to denounce Yan's bandit crimes and held a solemn oath before the memorial tablet: "Parents, brothers, and sisters! We will definitely fight Yan Xishan, the murderer, to the end! Eliminate Yan Xishan and avenge you!" They also resolutely guaranteed to the Party: "When we get to the front, we will work actively, fight bravely, and strive to earn merits." Li Chengren said: "I applied to join the Party three times, and now it has been approved. I only have one thought now: to capture more prisoners and seize more guns on the battlefield." Some soldiers even bit their fingers to write blood oaths to show their determination. Gao Zhiyi, the platoon leader of the first company, swore: "I will strive to earn merits on the front line and strive to be converted from a probationary party member to a full party member." The Jinzhong Eighth Sub-district issued a combat mobilization order. At the mobilization meeting, the commander and political commissar of the sub-district emphasized that all Party policies must be implemented in combat, and this would test the Party spirit of Party committees, branches, and members at all levels. After the meeting, a small number of cadres and soldiers reviewed their own erroneous thoughts of wanting to "make a fortune" in the plains and decided to resolutely correct them. A certain unit also established a discipline inspection team to resolutely ensure that the unit becomes a model for implementing policies.

　　地武民兵出发宣誓
    向阎锡山复仇
    【新华社晋绥二日电】“向阎锡山复仇!”向阎占区进军的晋中地方武装中传遍了这一悲愤口号。某民兵干部队于出征之前，特设灵公祭死于阎匪“自白转生”暴行下的父母兄妹。张振基走到他的父亲灵前，只说了一句：“爹爹，你死得好冤呀！”他就眼泪直涌，哭不成声了。五十二位烈士子弟相继登台控诉阎匪罪恶，并举行灵前悲壮宣誓：“爹妈兄妹们！我们一定和凶手阎锡山拼到底！消灭阎锡山，为你们报仇！”他们并坚决向党保证：“我们到前方，积极工作，英勇作战，争取立功。”李成仁说：我三次要求入党，现在被批准了。我现在只有一个思想：上战场多捉俘虏多缴枪。”有的战士为表明决心，甚至咬破指头写血书。一连排长高志义宣誓：“我争取火线立功，争取候补党员转为正式党员。”晋中八分区颁布了作战动员令。在动员大会上，分区司令员及政委强调指出作战中必须执行党的各种政策，并以此考验各级党委、支部和党员的党性。会后，少数干部、战士检讨了自己还夹杂了想到平川“发洋财”的错误思想，决定坚决加以改正。某部并成立了纪律检查组，坚决保证本部成为执行政策的模范。
