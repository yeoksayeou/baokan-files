　　【Jizhong Electric】 The local armed forces, militia, and work teams of the Tenth Military Sub-district of Jizhong have been actively operating in the vicinity of Beijing and Tianjin, achieving great results in the past year. The local armed forces of the entire sub-district have fought 579 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 6,880 officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet forces, including the puppet regiment commander Zhai Zongzhou (killed), deputy regiment commander Niu Buyun (captured), and the puppet county magistrate of Wen'an, Gao Zezhou (killed); seizing 7 artillery pieces, 93 light and heavy machine guns, 2,020 rifles and carbines, 20 grenade launchers, and 136,650 rounds of ammunition. From January to June this year, the militia of the entire sub-district fought 488 battles in half a year, killing, wounding, and capturing 724 enemies. The morale of the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops in various parts of the Daqing River North is declining daily under the continuous attacks of our army, and the number of deserters and surrenders is increasing day by day. According to statistics for June alone, the "Chiang Army Retiree Reception Center" in the Tenth Military Sub-district received more than 1,700 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet officers and soldiers who had deserted or surrendered, an increase of one-third compared to May, and more than double the total number received in January, February, March, and April (more than 700).
　　【Another Dispatch】 A certain unit of the local armed forces of the Tenth Military Sub-district bravely advanced into the Daxing area, north of the Yongding River, and actively attacked the enemy behind enemy lines. On June 23, they drove away the puppet troops stationed in Xiaocixiang, seizing two rifles. On June 24, they attacked the troops of the local Chiang Kai-shek bandit Liu Cuiran, who were dispatched to seize wheat in Beiwangli Village, killing ten enemies, wounding one enemy, and seizing two rifles. On June 25, they attacked the Chiang bandit stronghold in Nangezhuang, and the defending enemy fled in panic, and the stronghold was completely destroyed by us.
　　【Jizhong Electric】 The cadres and militia of our Qingyuan County repelled an invasion by Chiang bandits thirty times their number, killing and wounding forty-two bandits, demonstrating a high degree of tenacity and bravery. On the 4th of this month, two regiments of the 32nd Provisional Division and two battalions of the 33rd Provisional Division of the Chiang bandits in Baoding, combined with more than 3,000 local Chiang bandits, with more than 200 carts, invaded Dabaotuan Village, Lang Village, and Biyangcheng area in the Fourth District of Qingyuan County in three routes to plunder grain. Our local cadres and militia rose up to resist and launched fierce village battles with the enemy. The enemy concentrated its forces and launched three assaults on our positions under the cover of machine guns and artillery, but were all repelled. Liu Zhi, the captain of a certain district, killed or wounded seven enemies alone. Zhi, the head of a certain district, led the militia in bravely resisting, killing or wounding more than twenty enemies. The local people braved the enemy's fierce artillery fire to actively support the combat militia, delivering water and food and helping to observe the enemy's situation.
