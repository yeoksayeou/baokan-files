　　Luoyang Construction Briefs
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 30th: (1) The Luoyang Municipal Government called on citizens to dismantle all the pillboxes and fortifications built by the Chiang bandits, and use the bricks and wood to build new houses. Citizens who were left homeless by the Chiang bandits' demolition or burning of houses were all overjoyed. The Fourth District of Luoyang City had 2,311 houses demolished and burned by the Youth Army 206th Division. Now, the citizens of the district have demolished 37 pillboxes, leveled 83 fortifications, flattened 7 moats, and built 175 new houses. The Southeast and Northwest Cross Streets, which were originally a pile of rubble, have gradually become a bustling market again. (2) Most of the handicraft industries in Luoyang City have resumed operations. The Zhicheng and Yuxing foundries are manufacturing iron pots and pot skins, and each family can cast 1,000 jin of pig iron per day. Business is extremely good, and the pots are bought before they even cool down. During the period when the Chiang bandits occupied the area last year, Zhicheng Factory lost more than 30,000 jin of iron and more than 10,000 jin of charcoal due to donations, labor, and pots. In November, the Chiang bandit Youth Army simply demolished the factory building, and the factory was forced to close down. In addition, after the opening of 33 soap factories such as Dahua and Xiangtai, the soap is now selling well in Ru, Song, Yu, and Shan counties. (3) The Chiang currency in Luoyang City has plummeted wildly. Its ratio to Jicha has fallen from 50 to 1 to 70 to 1, and then to 100 to 1. The reason is that the Chiang bandit army has suffered repeated defeats on various battlefields. In addition, a large number of goods are being transported from the old liberated areas north of the Yellow River. Merchants are vying for Jicha and throwing out Chiang currency.

　　洛阳建设简讯
    【新华社中原三十日电】（一）洛阳市府号召市民拆除蒋匪所修筑的一切碉堡工事，利用砖木修盖新房。被蒋匪拆毁或烧毁房屋无家可归的市民无不兴高采烈。洛市第四区曾被青年军二○六师拆毁及烧毁民房二千三百一十一间；现该区市民已拆毁碉堡三十七个，扫平工事八十三个，平壕沟七条，修成新房一百七十五间。原为一片瓦砾的东南两关十字街，已又渐成闹市。（二）洛市各手工业大部复业，翻沙厂志诚、裕兴等，制造铁锅、锅皮，每天每家能翻生铁一千斤。生意极好，刚铸下来还没有冷就被买去。志诚厂在去年蒋匪盘踞期间因出捐、出夫、出锅，仅原料一项即赔了三万多斤铁，一万多斤炭。十一月间蒋匪青年军干脆把该厂厂房拆掉，该厂乃被迫倒闭。又大华、祥泰等三十三家肥皂厂开业后，现肥皂畅销汝、嵩县、禹县及陕县等地。（三）洛市蒋币狂跌，其与冀钞之比，由五十比一跌至七十比一，再跌至一百比一。原来是蒋匪军在各战场上连吃败仗。另外则大批货物从黄河北岸老解放区源源运来，商人均争要冀钞，抛出蒋币。
