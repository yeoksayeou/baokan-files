　　[Jizhong Electric] Xinji City Yonghua Chemical Company has successfully trialed the production of sulfuric acid, and is now able to produce 400 catties per day. Carbon rods have also recently been successfully trialed and are preparing for mass production.
　　[Another Dispatch] After painstaking research, automobile workers such as Yu Haiquan from the Jizhong Transportation Company used scrap iron to manufacture automobile parts such as hook shells, hook shell axles, expansion rings, and rubber cloth. The quality is better than foreign goods, and the price is also cheaper. Foreign hook shells cost 1.6 million yuan per set in foreign currency, while the self-made products are half the price.

　　辛集永华公司试制硫酸成功
    【冀中电】辛集市永华化学公司，试制硫酸成功，现在每天能出四百斤。炭精棒也于最近试制成功。正准备大量制造。
    【又电】冀中运输公司汽车工人于海泉等经过苦心研究，利用废铁制造勾贝、勾贝轴、涨圈、胶布等汽车零件，比外来货质量还好，价钱也较便宜，外来的勾贝每套合边洋一百六十万元，自制品则便宜一倍。
