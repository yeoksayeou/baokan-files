[North Yue News] Yangqu Shipotou Village has a total of forty-nine households, only eight li away from the enemy stronghold, and is frequently robbed by the enemy. On April 26th, the enemy pulled away eight of the village's only twelve donkeys, creating serious difficulties in spring plowing and sowing. However, the masses of the village were not discouraged by this. In addition to organizing the militia to extend the front and bury mines to continue the struggle against the enemy, they also actively organized people to dig the land. With the efforts of the masses in the whole village, manpower replaced animal power. In a few days, two hundred mu were dug and all were sown.

　　阳曲石坡头组织人力克服畜荒
    【北岳讯】阳曲石坡头村共四十九户，离敌据点仅八里，不时被敌抢劫。四月廿六日，敌人又把全村仅有的十二头毛驴拉走八头，因此造成春耕下种中的严重困难。该但是村群众却并不因此而丝毫灰心，除一面组织民兵伸前埋雷，继续对敌斗争外，并积极组织人刨地。在全村群众的努力下，人力代替了畜力，不几天刨了二百亩，全都下了种。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（杨效英、韩银芳）
