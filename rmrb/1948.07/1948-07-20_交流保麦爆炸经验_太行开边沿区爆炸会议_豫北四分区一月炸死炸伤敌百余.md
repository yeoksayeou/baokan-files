    Exchanging Experience in Protecting Wheat with Explosives
    Taihang Opens Border Area Explosives Conference
    Yubei Fourth Military Sub-district Kills and Wounds Over 100 Enemies in One Month
    [Taihang Electric] In order to better carry out the explosive movement to protect grain, Taihang Border Area successively convened explosives conferences in late June. The Yubei Fourth Military Sub-district's Military Commission convened cadres with explosive experience to exchange explosive experiences in the wheat protection battle, conduct landmine exhibitions, and collectively observe and critique. They unanimously recommended the "three-sound mine" and "three-strand fuse mine" as the best. Detailed research and discussion were conducted on various types of mines (pressure mine, surface mine, trip mine, kick mine, three-strand fuse mine, pull mine, winnowing fan mine, drop mine, three-sound mine, etc.) regarding organization, division of labor, required tools, suitable terrain, digging, ignition, and camouflage. After the discussion, tactical exercises were conducted, yielding significant results. Finally, everyone examined that past explosives work was not good enough, mainly due to poor technology and insufficient integration with tactics. The explosives expert meeting held in Yuci County, Jinzhong, examined the obstacles to the failure to universally carry out the explosives movement in the first half of the year: (1) Labor and military were not combined; some militiamen were busy with production and abandoned the struggle against the enemy. (2) Deviations occurred in party rectification, which also produced extreme democratic tendencies; some militiamen and self-defense forces did not obey leadership. (3) Mine-laying technology was not studied and improved, resulting in some losses. (4) Some places were complacent and negligent, intelligence work was unsound, and the development of landmine warfare was abandoned. Finally, it was decided to clear the obstacles and launch a "thousand mine" movement. Taigu County also held an 80-person explosives training class to cultivate explosive talent and carry out the explosives movement.
    [Taihang Electric] The Yubei Fourth Military Sub-district launched a mass explosive movement in the struggle to protect wheat. In one month, a total of 132 enemies were killed and wounded. After the Military Sub-district's wheat protection conference in early May proposed launching a "ten thousand mine" movement, the Military Commission actively rushed to manufacture a large number of landmines and distributed them to various counties. The counties also convened mobilization meetings at all levels, settled accounts with the complacent and negligent thinking of some cadres, and separately opened explosives training classes to train a large number of explosives experts. Jiaozuo, Bo'ai, and other counties also specifically organized forces, delineated minefields, and responsible cadres personally led the mine-laying. At the same time, propaganda was conducted about our army's victory, exposing the enemy's desperate atrocities, and arousing the fighting spirit of the masses. Xiuwu First District launched a "each household x number of watchdog" movement. After seven days of concentrated effort, all villages had stone mines. Thousands of stone mines were manufactured in two or three days. Women in Dongzhuang and Da Xiaozhai in Jiaozuo also learned to assemble stone mines and make explosive tubes. Now every household is making stone mines. On May 27th, the Xiuwu Second District rotation team, in coordination with the district cadre team, used landmine warfare combined with sniper warfare to repel the enemy's invasion of over 700 people to seize wheat, killing and wounding six enemies. On May 6th, the Bo'ai Eighth District West Joint Defense militia also used landmines combined with sparrow warfare to repel the invasion of 500+ Chiang bandits, killing and wounding over 20 bandits. On June 2nd, when the enemy invaded Dong Wanzhen Village in Xiuwu First District, they stepped on a landmine at the ditch in the northwest corner of the village, killing one person; when they pushed open a gate to enter the village, there was a loud bang, wounding two enemies; when they entered the house door, another person was wounded. When three Chiang bandits went to grab the wheat placed in a winnowing fan in the courtyard, the mine buried underneath went off with a loud bang, and all three Chiang bandits were wounded. Since then, the enemy dared not enter the gate, dared not touch anything, and dared not rummage around. On June 3rd, the enemy's 40th Division, 318th Regiment, in coordination with miscellaneous diehards, a total of more than 3,000, invaded the Beiguanzhuang area of Wuzhi to seize wheat. Most of our masses were transferred, leaving the task of guarding the threshing ground and house doors to the landmines. When the enemy came, the three villages of Beiguanzhuang, Da Li Village, and Ma Village detonated 27 landmines, killing 20 enemy company commanders and platoon leaders. In total, from May 10th to June 10th, in one month, according to incomplete statistics, landmines killed and wounded 132 enemies, including Hou Deqing, the deputy head of the puppet Special Commissioner's Office Security Regiment.

　　交流保麦爆炸经验
    太行开边沿区爆炸会议
    豫北四分区一月炸死炸伤敌百余
    【太行电】太行边地为更好开展护粮爆炸运动，曾于六月下旬先后召开爆炸会议。豫北四分区武委会召集有爆炸经验的干部开会，交流保麦战中的爆炸经验，进行地雷展览，集体参观、批评，一致推荐三响雷、三股弦雷等为最好。并把各种雷雷（踏雷、地皮雷、拌雷、踢雷、三股弦雷、拉雷、簸箕雷、坠雷、三响雷等）从组织分工、需用工具、适用地形，及挖洞、接火、伪装，都做了细密的研究讨论。讨论后，又进行战术实习，收效甚大。最后大家检查过去爆炸还不够好，主要是技术太差，和战术结合不够。晋中榆次县召开的爆炸能手会议上，检查了前半年爆炸运动未能普遍开展的障碍是：（一）劳武没结合，有些民兵忙于生产，放弃对敌斗争。（二）整党发生偏差，同时产生极端民主的偏向，有些民兵自卫队不服从领导。（三）埋雷技术不研究，提不高，以致遭受部分损失。（四）有的地方轻敌麻痹，情报工作不健全，放弃开展地雷战。最后决定扫清障碍，开展千雷运动。太谷县并举办八十人的爆炸训练班，培养爆炸人才，开展爆炸运动。
    【太行电】豫北四分区在护麦斗争中，开展了群众性的爆炸运动。一个月中，共炸死炸伤敌一百三十二名。五月初分区保麦会议上提出开展万雷运动后，该分区武委会就积极赶造了大量地雷发与各县，各县也召开了各级动员会，清算了某些干部思想上的轻敌麻痹，分别开办爆炸训练班，训练出大批爆炸手。焦作、博爱等县并具体组织力量，划定雷区，负责干部亲自领导埋设。同时宣传我军胜利，揭发敌人垂死挣扎的暴行，激发了群众斗志。修武一区开展每家×个看门狗运动，经七天突击，各村都有了石雷。两三天内制造石雷×千个。焦作东庄、大小寨妇女也都学会装石雷，造爆炸管，现家家都造了石雷。五月二十七日，修武二区轮战队配合区干队，用地雷战结合冷枪战，击退敌七百余人的抢麦进犯，并毙伤敌六名。五月六日，博爱八区西联防民兵，也以地雷结合麻雀战，击退五百余蒋匪的进犯，毙伤匪二十余名。六月二号，敌人进犯修武一区东万斟村，经村西北角路沟，踏响一个地雷，炸死一名；进村一推大门，轰的一声，炸伤敌二名；进屋门时又炸伤一名。当三个蒋匪去抢放在当院簸箕里的麦子时，底下埋的雷又是轰的一声，三个蒋匪均被炸伤。从此敌人见门不敢进，见物不敢动，更不敢乱刨乱找了。六月三日，焦作敌四十师三一八团配合杂顽共三千余，进犯我武陟北官庄一带抢麦，我群众大部转移，把看守场和家门的任务交给地雷。敌人来时，北官庄、大李村、马村等三个村，爆炸地雷二十七个，炸死敌中队长、分队长以下二十名。总计五月十日至六月十日一个月中，据不完全统计，地雷毙伤敌伪专署保安副团长侯德清以下一百三十二名。
