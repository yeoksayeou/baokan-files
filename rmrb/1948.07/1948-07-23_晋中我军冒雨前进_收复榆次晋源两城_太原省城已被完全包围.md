　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 20th Urgent Dispatch] The People's Liberation Army on the Jinzhong front, advancing in the rain, successively recovered the two county towns of Yuci and Jinyuan (formerly Taiyuan County) south of Taiyuan City on the 19th and 20th. Yan Xishan's lair, Taiyuan Provincial Capital, is now completely surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. Our army liberated Yuci City, the connecting point of the Tongpu and Zhengtai Railways, sixty miles southeast of Taiyuan City, on the 19th. The defending enemy's Eighth Corps took advantage of the rain on the night of the 18th to flee towards Taiyuan, and a part of them were annihilated by our ambushing troops. The remnants are being pursued by our troops. Jinyuan County, thirty miles southwest of Taiyuan City, was occupied by our army on the morning of the 20th. The defending enemy engineers abandoned the city and fled on the 19th. So far, the only cities occupied by the bandit Yan are Taiyuan City and Xinxian to its north. (Picture attached)
