　　U.S. Aid to Chiang Exchanges Privileges and Threatens the Survival of the Chinese Nation
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: TASS Moscow, 18th: The Soviet Labor Daily recently published a commentary on U.S. aid to Chiang Kai-shek. The article stated: The recent new loan granted by the United States to the Kuomintang, like the Marshall Plan for Europe, is attached with conditions that genuinely threaten the survival of Chinese national independence. The first demand made by the United States to Nanjing is to implement "freedom of foreign trade." China has already reduced the tariff rates on some American imports and allowed low tax rates to be maintained on many important imports. The quantity of imports must also be determined according to the opinions of American merchants; goods imported from the United States now account for nearly 80 percent of China's total imports. China's tariff revenue has become one of the means of guaranteeing American loans and is entirely controlled by American officials. Chinese production, trade, and distribution are also entirely controlled by American officials. South China—China's rich region, the world's largest deposit of antimony, tungsten, and lead, has long been coveted by American monopoly capitalists. Since the end of the Pacific War, the United States has almost completely squeezed Britain out of China, especially South China. The defeats of the Kuomintang army in Manchuria, North China, and Central China have forced the United States to concentrate its efforts on accelerating the colonization of South China and Southwest China. The Guangdong authorities have drafted special "regulations" regarding foreign investment, which allow American capitalists to establish many large enterprises in Guangdong, including the construction of Huangpu Port. According to the American plan, the role of the port will be similar to the role that Hong Kong has played in the past. Two hundred American companies have been approved to establish industrial factories in Guangdong. The article emphasized that the United States provides military assistance to the Kuomintang on the condition that all Chinese military institutions below the Ministry of National Defense are controlled by the United States. The so-called American military advisory group not only has the power to organize and train the Kuomintang army but is also responsible for performing the duties of the General Staff. This advisory group has 5,000 people, which is equivalent to a brigade in terms of quantity. In addition, the U.S. Navy also controls the Kuomintang fleet established with U.S. funding. The American economic plan in South China is also inseparable from its military plan. American military activities in South China follow three major guidelines: suppressing the national liberation movement in the provinces of South China; establishing military training centers and supply bases in South China for the Kuomintang to conduct the civil war; and carrying out strategic construction needed by the United States. In granting new loans to the Kuomintang, the United States has obtained new privileges to establish army, navy, and air force bases, a large part of which are already under construction in South China.

  　美帝援蒋换取特权威胁中国民族生存
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日电：苏联劳动报顷载文评论美国对蒋介石的援助。该文称：美国最近给予国民党的新贷款，象马歇尔对欧计划一样，附有真正威胁中国民族独立生存的条件。美国向南京提出的第一个要求就是实施“对外贸易自由”。中国已将一些美国进口货的关税率减低，并允许对许多重要进口货都保持低税率。进口数量也得遵照美国商人的意见决定；现在由美国输入的货物几占中国全部进口的百分之八十。中国的关税收入已变成担保美国贷款的手段之一，全部都为美官员控制。中国生产、贸易与分配也统统为美官员所控制。华南——中国的富庶地区，是世界上最大的锑、钨、铅蕴藏地，久已为美国垄断资本家垂涎。自太平洋战争结束以来，美国几乎已将英国完全排出中国，特别是华南。国民党军在满洲、华北与华中的败仗，使美国只能集中力量使华南和西南加速殖民地化。广东当局已拟出关于外人投资的特别“规章”，这些规章准许美国资本家在广东建立许多个大企业，并包括修建黄埔港。按照美国计划，该港作用将与香港过去所起过的作用相类似。两百家美国公司已获准在广东成立工业厂坊。该文着重指出：美国给国民党以军事援助是以自国防部以下的中国一切军事机构概由美国控制为条件的。所谓美国军事顾问团不仅有组织与训练国民党军队之权，而且负有行使参谋总部职务之责。这个顾问团有五千人，就数量言，等于一个旅。此外美国海军并控制了由美国资助建立起来的国民党舰队。美国在华南的经济计划也是与其军事计划分不开的。美国在华南的军事活动遵循下列三大方针：镇压华南各省的民族解放运动；在华南建立军事训练中心与供应基地以便国民党进行内战；进行美国所需要的战略建设。在给国民党以新贷款时，美国已取得了建立陆海空军基地的新特权，这些基地有很大一部分已在华南建筑中。
