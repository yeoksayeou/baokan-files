　　Laishui, Wanping and Other Places
    Organize Doctors to Eradicate Disease Disasters
    [Chahar News] According to reports from Laishui, Wanping, and other places, epidemics such as smallpox, typhus, malaria, and dysentery have recently been discovered. In the Tahe, Huangta, and other eight villages of Wanping District alone, there are more than 100 patients (11 deaths), and in the Qiulinpu village of the Fourth District, 160 people have fallen ill. More than 30 students at a Laishui elementary school are sick. The Beiyue Third Administrative Office has issued an urgent instruction to all counties, calling for the rapid adoption of effective measures to prevent and eradicate the diseases, so as not to affect production and ensure "prosperity for both people and wealth." It pointed out: (1) Organize doctors to diagnose and treat patients in disease-stricken villages, and increase research and innovation in disease symptoms and medicines. Call on doctors to spread secret recipes to improve their diagnostic and treatment skills and effectiveness. (2) Strengthen publicity and education among the masses. Seek treatment quickly when sick, and do not engage in superstition or seek witch doctors. Witch doctors should be reformed, and the government can punish them. (3) Strengthen disease prevention and carry out sanitation campaigns, such as sprinkling lime on the ground, putting white chess pieces in water tanks, eating less raw and cold food, and isolating the sick. (4) Provide special relief to poor households who are sick. The Administrative Office has allocated 45 million yuan (border currency) in medical loans to be distributed to various counties for the treatment of diseases.
    [Further News] After receiving notification of a disease disaster in the Tahe District, the Wanping County Medical Association immediately held a forum for doctors in the entire district in Tahe Village on June 21 to study ways to eradicate the disease disaster. Doctors Du Yantian and Cui Shi proposed: Everyone should contribute what they have and use all their strength to eliminate the disease disaster. Think of more folk remedies and use cheap medicines instead of expensive ones as much as possible to reduce the financial burden on the masses. Everyone expressed great agreement with their opinions. After the meeting, they were divided into two groups to visit the sick in various households in Tahe Village. During the visits, a consultation method was adopted, with doctors taking turns to examine patients, followed by a discussion of what folk remedies to use and whether medication was needed. This approach not only provided a thorough understanding of the disease but also allowed for mutual learning of techniques and exchange of experience. The masses gratefully said, "The higher authorities are truly concerned about us. As soon as they saw that we were sick, they sent doctors to us."

　　涞水、宛平等地
    组织医生扑灭病灾
    【察哈尔讯】据涞水、宛平等地报告，各地近发现天花、瘟疹、疟痢等流行病，仅宛平一区塔河、黄塔等八村，即有一百多病人（死亡了十一名），四区秋林铺一村即病倒一百六十人；涞水一个高小即有三十多人闹病。北岳三专署特为此紧急指示各县，迅速采取有效措施，预防扑灭，以免影响生产保证“人财两旺”。指出：（一）组织医生到病灾村诊治，对病症、医药，多加研究创造，号召医生流传秘方，以提高医生诊治技术和效果。（二）加强对群众宣传教育，有病要赶快治，不要闹迷信求巫婆，对巫婆要改造，可由政府予以制裁。（三）加强疾病预防，开展清洁卫生运动，如地上洒石灰，水缸着白棋，少吃生冷，有病人就隔离。（四）对有病穷苦户，特予救济。专署拨出医药贷款四千五百万元（边币）分发各县，以为救治疾病之用。
    【又讯】宛平县医联会接到塔河小区发生病灾的通知后，立即于六月二十一日，在塔河村召开全区医生座谈会，研究扑灭病灾的办法。杜砚田、璀石二医生提出：大家应该有什么就献出什么，以全部力量朴灭病灾，要多想一些偏方，要尽可能的用贱药代替贵药，使群众少花钱。大家对于他们的意见都表示非常同意。会后，即分成两个小组，到塔河村各病户中去看病。在看病时，都采用了会诊办法，轮流看过病人后，大家讨论用什么偏方治，是否需要吃药。这样作法，不地病症看的透彻，而且可以互相学习技术，交流经验。群众感激的说：“上级对咱们真关心，一见咱们有病，就给请了医生来了。”
