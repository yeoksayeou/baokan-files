Debate on an Economic Problem
    Yī· Lāfūtiěfū (依·拉甫捷夫)
    Regarding the question of the possibility of a new stage of imperialism, Varga said: "The issue of a new stage of capitalist development has not yet been thoroughly considered." (?!?) He himself answers this question as follows: "It may or may not be possible. But all in all, the question is limited to the name and not its essence." Wrong, Comrade Varga! Whether there may be a new stage of imperialism is not a matter of name but one of the basic and major issues in the socialist Leninist-Stalinist revolutionary theory. This question is one that has long been thoroughly considered and has long been resolved. As for the theory of the decisive significance of the bourgeois state in capitalist economics, eliminating capitalist anarchy, the basis of planned capitalist economy, etc., it is essentially a restoration of the opportunist theory of "organized capitalism."
    　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    Comrade Varga writes at the beginning of his book: "Analyzing the political changes caused by the war is not the purpose of this book." He plans to explore political changes in another work. The debate correctly pointed out the error of this book's separation of economic issues from political issues. How serious errors can occur under this erroneous way of thinking! For example, Comrade Varga regards the establishment of New Democratic countries merely as political changes. In fact, this is not only political but should first of all be a major socio-economic change in the world capitalist structure, one of the most important events in the sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism.

    The most important result of the First World War was the breaking of the unified imperialist front; the victory of the October Socialist Revolution enabled Russia to break away from the world capitalist system. One of the most important results of the Second World War, which defeated fascism, was the liberation of the countries of Central Europe and Southeastern Europe from the imperialist system.

    Comrade Varga does not understand and does not correctly explain the significant socio-economic changes in these countries. When discussing the economy of the New Democratic countries, he believes that "state capitalism is dominant," and he further writes: "The emergence of this new type of economy (an economy that can no longer be called capitalism as understood in the old sense), no matter how important it is in these countries, and no matter how much significance it has, the proportion of these countries in the entire capitalist world economy is relatively small and has not fundamentally changed the general prospects of capitalist development." (Page 291) This is equivalent to him believing that the economies of these countries are capitalist (although no longer in the "old sense"), are a form of state capitalism, and are part of the overall capitalist economy. According to the author, the emergence of New Democratic countries is not of great significance for the future of capitalist development.

    Obviously, these errors of Comrade Varga are not of a local nature. It is closely related to the author's incorrect assessment of the general crisis of capitalism and the balance of power between the two camps of capitalism and socialism—democracy and imperialism.

    In reality, a new form of state—people's republic—has been created in the People's Democratic countries, where power belongs to the people, and the alliance of the working class and all working people, led by the working class, is the dominant force. The nationalization of large industries and banks implemented in these countries means the creation of state ownership by the whole people. These countries have liberated the masses from imperialist enslavement.

    As a result of agricultural reforms, land belongs to the peasants, which eliminates the landlord class. The working people of the New Democratic countries have laid the foundation for the transition to socialist development.

    Comrade Varga said during the debate: "I admit that the wording 'state capitalism is dominant' on page 291 is incorrect." As mentioned above, this is not just an incorrect wording; the assessment of the general crisis of capitalism is also incorrect. During the debate, several speakers correctly criticized Comrade Varga's underestimation of the role played by planned economy in the New Democratic countries, his incorrect understanding of the significance of land reform, and his non-Marxist assessment of the processes occurring between the suzerain states and the colonies.
    　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    During the debate, everyone paid close attention to criticizing Comrade Varga's peculiar theory of the impoverishment of capitalist belligerent countries. Of course, the destruction of productive forces by war, the inability of tax revenues to cover war expenditures, and the reduction of national wealth (except for the United States, which became rich in the war), etc., are undeniable facts. As the criticism pointed out, Varga failed to treat this issue from a class analysis. Therefore, he failed to point out that in capitalist countries, the main burden of the war was shifted to the poor masses, while the bourgeoisie, especially certain classes, became rich because of the war. Therefore, it is strange that Comrade Varga believes that extending working hours and increasing labor intensity, etc., are a counter-trend to resist the process of national impoverishment. Comrade Varga's theory of impoverishment has other meanings. It is well known that in his book "The Exhaustion of Economic Resources of Fascist Germany," it was pointed out that the process of Germany's impoverishment and the continuous consumption of its economic resources had in fact begun in 1941, which was primarily the reason for Germany's demise.

    Although this obviously incorrect argument has been criticized in our publications, Comrade Varga stubbornly sticks to his views during the debate. In fact, the theory of universal impoverishment of capitalist belligerent countries cannot be equated with the law of uneven development of capitalism. Germany, in the period when it began to wage war against the Soviet Union and in 1942-1943, expanded its economic resources by plundering its enslaved European vassal states and exploiting the working class.

    Hitler's Germany failed because the Soviet Union's military, political, and economic strength surpassed it. The Soviet army, commanded by the great Stalin, not only accelerated the economic depletion of Fascist Germany, but was also the cause and the fundamental force for destroying the enemy's economic foundation. Therefore, the theory of attempting to explain Germany's demise through "impoverishment" is not only weak and powerless but also laughable.

    Comrade Varga divides the changes in the capitalist world economy during the war into two categories: temporary and long-term. Temporary changes will mainly determine the development of capitalism in the next ten years; long-term changes will only fully appear after the pre-war production level is fully reached, which, according to Comrade Varga, will take at least ten years. "In the first period, the unevenness of economic development that occurred during the war will have a decisive impact on the capitalist economic process." In the second period, when the "thorough" changes in capitalism caused by the war fully appear, it will manifest itself as "the intensification of the basic contradictions of capitalist society, the opposition between social production and individual ownership, and will first appear in the problem of realizing value, in other words, the market problem." (Page 12)

    These views of Comrade Varga on the future of capitalist development completely incorrectly oppose and separate the law of uneven capitalist development from the basic contradictions of capitalism. In reality, they are taking place simultaneously.

    The claim that the market problem will only occur ten years after the economic recovery of Europe is a serious error.

    For example, the market problem became more serious in the United States after the end of the war. Capitalist monopolies are trying to maintain the foreign markets where they sold their products during the war, because the purchasing power of many countries has declined due to the war, and they are trying to obtain new markets. American monopoly capital is attempting to politically and economically enslave the countries it is expanding into. This is the purpose of the infamous Marshall-Truman Plan.

    The market problem has become more acute as a result of the increasing impoverishment of the working class in capitalist countries after the war. Generally speaking, the growing crisis of overproduction in the United States, while also believing that the basic contradictions of capitalism will only fully occur ten years after the end of the war (as Comrade Varga has done), completely confuses the issue of the future of capitalist development.

    During the debate, it was correctly pointed out that Comrade Varga made the mistake of neglecting the characteristics of the New Democratic countries on the issue of restoring the economies of European countries to pre-war levels after ten years. These countries have already deviated from the normal course of capitalism, and economic revival is proceeding at a high speed and will be basically completed by their own efforts.

    Comrade Varga's views on the future of the class struggle have also been correctly criticized. He wrote in his book: "The role of the state will be more important in the future than before the war. More or less participating in the management of state affairs will become the main content of the political struggle between the two basic classes of capitalist society—the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The increasing polarization of capitalist society, the division between the two basic opposing classes, will further increase the proportion of the proletariat." (Page 318)

    These words sound very strange in modern times when all roads lead to communism. At the same time, when the socialist state of the Soviet Union has existed for thirty years, many European countries have established people's republics, and a higher form of state power has emerged than any democratic bourgeois republic, to say that the main content of the political struggle of the proletariat in capitalist society is to participate in the management of state affairs more or less! Marxists have always considered this limitation of the tasks of the proletariat to be a form of reformism.

    The Second World War caused great changes in the capitalist system and in the balance of power between capitalism and socialism. The most important results of the Second World War were the defeat of Germany and Japan; the detachment of several European countries from the world capitalist system, the establishment of people's republics, and the laying of the foundation for the transition to socialism; the socialist state—the Soviet Union—achieved victory and grew stronger in the war, and two camps were formed—imperialism led by the United States and democracy led by the Soviet Union. The struggle between these two camps is taking place in an environment of increasing aggravation of the general crisis of capitalism, the weakening of imperialist forces, and the strengthening of socialist democratic forces.

    Important changes have taken place in the balance of class forces within capitalist countries. For example, it can be clearly seen that the role of the Communist Party is increasing, and the leftward shift of the broad masses of working people is expanding. One of the important manifestations of the general crisis of capitalism is the upsurge of the colonial national liberation movement. Obviously, any analysis of capitalist economic changes that is detached from the above facts is destined to fail. Comrade Stalin's pointed out the essence of the general crisis of capitalism, the new balance of international forces between socialism and capitalism, is the only correct and truly scientific basis for understanding the changes in the capitalist economy after the Second World War.

    The task of our economists is to deeply study the practical problems of Soviet economic life and capitalist economic life based on the Leninist-Stalinist doctrine, and to expose with Bolshevik partisanship those anti-Marxist-Leninist views that, unfortunately, are still prevalent in our economics.

    There are enough cadres in the science of Soviet economics to complete the tasks facing the Party and the state.

　　关于一个经济学问题的论战
    依·拉甫捷夫
    关于帝国主义新阶段可能性的问题，瓦尔加说：“资本主义发展的新阶段问题尚未考虑成熟。”（？！）他自己答复这问题如下：“可能有，可能没有。但是总而言之，问题仅限于名称而非其本质。”不对，瓦尔加同志！是否可能有帝国主义新阶段的问题，不是名称问题而是社会主义列宁、斯大林革命理论中基本的主要的问题之一。这一问题乃是一个早已被考虑成熟，而且早经解决的了。至于谈到资本主义经济学中的资产阶级国家的决定意义，消除资本主义无政府状态、资本主义经济的计划性的基础等等理论，在本质上是复辟了的机会主义的“组织的资本主义”理论。
    　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    瓦尔加同志在书中的开头写道：“分析为战争所引起的政治上的变化并不是本书的目的。”他准备在另外的著作里探讨政治上的变化。论战时正确地指出了本书著作将经济问题脱离政治问题的错误。在这种错误的思想方法之下，会发生多么严重的错误！例如瓦尔加同志将新民主国家的成立仅当作政治上的变化。实际上这不仅是政治，而首先应当是世界资本主义构成中重大的社会经济变化，是资本主义总危机尖锐化中头等事件之一。
    第一次世界大战的最重要的结果是统一的帝国主义战线的被冲破；十月社会主义革命的胜利使俄国脱离了世界资本主义的体系。击溃法西斯的第二次世界大战的最重要的结果之一，是中欧和南东欧各国从帝国主义体系的解放。
    瓦尔加同志不了解，并且不正确的阐明这些国家的重大社会经济变化。他在论述新民主国家经济时，认为“国家资本主义占优势”，他更写道：“这种新型经济的出现（这种经济已不能称之为旧语意中被了解的那种资本主义），在这些国度中无论如何重要，也无论其具有多少重大的意义，在整个资本主义世界经济中，这些国家的比重比较不大，并且基本上尚未变更整个资本主义发展的一般前途。”（二九一页）这等于他认为这些国家的经济是资本主义的（虽然已不是“旧语义”），是国家资本主义的形式，是整个资本主义经济的构成部分。按照著者的意见，新民主国家的出现对于资本主义的发展前途并无重大意义。
    显然，瓦尔加同志的这些错误并不是局部的性质。它与著者对资本主义总危机、资本主义与社会主义两个阵营——民主与帝国主义的力量对比之不正确估计密切相连。
    实际上，在人民民主国家里创造了新的国家形态——人民的共和国，在那里政权属于民众，以工人阶级为首的人民各劳动阶级的联盟乃是主导的力量。在这些国家里所实行的大工业与银行的国有化，意味着创造了国家的全民的所有制。这些国家把群众从帝国主义的奴役下解放出来。
    由于农业改革的结果，土地归于农民，这就消灭了地主阶级。新民主国家的勤劳人民奠定了过渡到社会主义发展的基础。
    瓦尔加同志在论战时说：“我承认在二九一页里‘国家资本主义占优势’的用语不正确。”正如上述，这并不仅是用语的不正确；关于资本主义总危机的估计也不正确。争论时若干发言正确的批判了瓦尔加同志对于在新民主主义国家计划经济所起的作用的过低的评价，对于土地改革意义不正确的认识，以及对于宗主国与殖民地之间发生着的过程之非马克思主义的估计。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    在论战中，大家很注意对瓦尔加同志的资本主义交战国家贫穷化的奇特的理论加以批判。当然战争使生产力破坏、岁入不足支应战争耗费、使国富减少（除去在战争中致富的美国）等等，皆是不容置辩的事实。正如批判所指摘，瓦尔加未从阶级分析上去对待这一问题。因此他未能指出在资本主义国家，战争的主要负担被转嫁给贫苦大众，同时资产阶级，特别是某些阶层却因战争致富。因此，瓦尔加同志认为延长工作时间，增加劳动强度等乃是抵抗国家贫穷化过程的一种反趋势之这一论点，便成为奇怪的事了。瓦尔加同志的贫穷化理论还另有其他意义。众所周知，在其所编纂的“法西斯德国经济资源的枯竭”一书里，曾指出德国贫穷化过程及其经济资源的不断的消耗，在事实上从一九四一年已经开始，这首先是德国破灭的原因。
    虽然在我们的刊物中曾批判了这种显然不正确的论点，但瓦尔加同志在论战时却固执己见。实际，资本主义交战国家普遍贫穷化的理论与资本主义不平衡发展的法则是不能同日而语的。德国在开始对苏联作战及一九四二至一九四三的期间，曾用掠夺被其奴役的欧洲属国和剥削工人阶级的手段扩大了其经济资源。
    希特勒德国是因为苏联的军事政治经济各方面的力量超越了他而失败。为伟大的斯大林所指挥的苏联军队，不但加速了法西斯德国的经济枯竭，而且又是破坏敌人经济基础的原因和基本力量。因此企图说明德国之败灭于“贫穷化”的理论，不但是贫乏无力而且是可笑的。
    瓦尔加同志将战时资本主义世界经济的变化分为暂时的和长期的二类。暂时的变化将主要地决定今后十年间的资本主义的发展；长期的变化将在完全达到战前生产水平之后才能整个的出现，按照瓦尔加同志的意见，这至少须在十年以后。“在第一期，战时发生的经济发展的不平均性将对资本主义经济过程给以决定的影响。”在第二期，当战争所产生的资本主义的“彻底”的变化完全出现时，它就表现为“资本主义社会基本矛盾的尖锐化，社会的生产与个人的所有间的对立，并且首先出现于实现价值的问题，换句话说就是市场问题上面。”（一二页）
    瓦尔加同志的这些关于资本主义发展前途的见解，完全不正确地把资本主义不平均发展法则和资本主义基本矛盾对立与分割起来。实际上它们是同时进行的。
    市场问题在十年后欧洲经济恢复完成之后才能发生的主张，是严重的错误。
    例如战争结束后市场问题在美国就更严重的发生了资本主义独占设法保持在战时销售其生产品的国外市场，因为战争，许多国家的购买力业已低下，并要设法获得新的市场。美国的独占资本企图在政治上经济上奴役其扩张对象的国家。这就是恶名昭著的马歇尔——杜鲁门计划的目的。
    市场问题因战后资本主义国家日益增长着的工人阶级贫困的结果，更为尖锐化起来。一般地说明美国生产过剩危机的日益增大，同时又认为资本主义基本矛盾将在战争结束十年后才全部发生（正象瓦尔加同志所作的），这就是资本主义发展前途的问题完全混乱。
    论战时正确地指出关于在经过十年后才能恢复欧洲诸国经济到战前水平问题上，瓦尔加同志犯了忽视了新民主国家特质的错误。这些国家业已逸出资本主义的常轨，经济复兴正以高度的速度进行并将基本上以自己的力量完成它。
    瓦尔加同志关于阶级斗争前途的观点也受到正确的批判。他在书中写道：“国家的作用将来会比战前更为重要。或多或少的参加管理国家问题，将成为资本主义社会两基本阶级——资产阶级和无产阶级——间政治斗争的主要内容。资本主义社会两极分化的日益增剧，两个基本对立的阶级分裂，会更为增大无产阶级的比重。”（三一八页）
    当一切道路走向共产主义时，这些话在现代听来是很奇怪的。同时，当苏联社会主义国家业已存在三十年，许多欧洲国家成立了人民的共和国，并出现了较之任何民主的资产阶级共和国更为高度形式的国家政权时，却说什么资本主义社会无产阶级政治斗争的主要内容是或多或少的参加管理国家！马克思主义者从来都认为这种对无产阶级任务的限制乃是一种改良主义。
    第二次世界大战在资本主义体系上、在资本主义和社会主义力量对比上引起了很大的变化。第二次世界大战的最重要结果是德国与日本的败北；从世界资本主义体系里脱落了几个欧洲国家，成立了人民的共和国并奠定了过渡到社会主义的基础；社会主义国家——苏联——获得胜利并在战争中壮大起来，成立了两个阵营——以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联为首的民主国家。这两个阵营的斗争是在资本主义总危机的日益尖锐化，帝国主义力量的削弱和社会主义民主力量的加强的环境下进行者。
    资本主义国家内部阶级力量的对比业已发生了重要的变化。例如明显的可以看出共产党的作用的增大、扩大劳动群众的左倾。资本主义总危机的重要表现之一就是殖民地民族解放运动的高潮。显然，一切资本主义经济变化的分析如果脱离上述事实便命定地要遭受失败。斯大林同志所指出的资本主义总危机的本质，社会主义和资本主义在国际间新的力量的对比，乃是了解第二次世界大战后资本主义经济变化的惟一正确的真正科学的基础。
    我们经济学者的任务乃是根据列宁——斯大林的学说深入地研究苏联经济生活与资本主义经济生活的实际问题，用布尔塞维克的党性去揭发那些可惜尚流布于我们经济学中的敌对马列主义的观点。
    苏联的经济学这一科学部门中，是有足够干部以完成摆在党和国家面前的任务的。
