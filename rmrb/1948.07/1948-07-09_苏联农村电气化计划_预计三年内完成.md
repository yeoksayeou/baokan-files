　　Soviet Rural Electrification Plan
    Expected to be Completed Within Three Years
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th] TASS reports: Work on the new Soviet rural electrification plan has already begun and is expected to be completed within three years. During this period, 38,500 collective farms and 4,300 machine and tractor stations and repair shops will be electrified. In the same period, 1,794 state farms will be electrified, so that all state farms in the Soviet Union will be fully electrified at that time. The rural electrification plan will enable all time-consuming and laborious tasks in agriculture, such as repairing machinery, threshing, hulling, drying, milling, milking, shearing, irrigation, and agricultural production, to use electricity. Electricity will be supplied by small-scale hydroelectric power plants, which will be built on local riverbanks or lakeshores. To this end, approximately 20,000 kilometers of rivers are being surveyed. Vocational schools will train 14,000 electrical engineering personnel to manage rural power plants. Universities and specialized schools will prepare thousands of experts for rural electrification. Since the beginning of this year, 600 power stations have been set up in collective farms. This year alone, 4,000 power stations will be built for collective farms. The power stations are built by the collective farm peasants themselves. The government provides long-term loans to the farmers for this purpose. Urban workers are vigorously helping rural electrification outside of working hours by processing and producing motorcycles and wires, and sending experts for construction consultation.

　　苏联农村电气化计划
    预计三年内完成
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社报导：新的苏联农村电气化计划的工作业已开始进行，预计在三年内完成。在这期间，将有三八五○○座集体农庄与四三○○座机器与拖拉机站和修理厂加以电气化。在同一期间，将有一七九四个国家农场电气化，这样，全苏联的国家农场届时将全部电气化。农村电气化计划将使农业上一切费时费力的工作，如修理机械、打谷、去谷、烘干、磨面、挤牛奶、剪羊毛、灌溉以及农业生产的进行，都使用电力。电力将由小规模水电厂供给，它们将建筑在当地河岸或湖边。为此，约二万公里的河流正被勘察中。各职业学校将训练一万四千名电气工程人员，以管理农村电厂。大学和专门学校将为农村电气化准备数千专家。自今年年初起，集体农庄已设置了六百个电力站。今年一年内，将为集体农庄建筑四千个电力站。电力站是由集体农庄农民自己建立的。政府为此给农民以长期贷款。城市工人则在工作时间之外，以加工生产摩托、电线和派遣专家咨商建筑等，来大力帮助乡村电气化。
