Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st: During the battle to capture Qufu, the People's Liberation Army took strict measures to protect ancient sites and cultural relics such as the Confucius Temple. The personnel in charge of the Confucius Mansion were able to stay at their posts in peace, and all kinds of ancient objects and treasures were preserved intact. The troops attacking the city issued rules for entering the city several days before the attack; after entering the East Gate at midnight on the 11th, they repeatedly ordered all units to pay special attention to protecting ancient sites and cultural relics when advancing deeper into the city. After the remnants of the enemy entrenched in the Confucius Mansion were wiped out, the attacking troops immediately withdrew outside the city, and the garrison troops designated by the headquarters guarded the ancient sites separately. After the battle, the unit immediately sent a team to tidy up the gardens and clean up the bases, post stations, and other places in the Confucius Temple, and officially opened it for visitors. The personnel in charge of the Confucius Mansion said: "The garrison troops issued a bulletin immediately after entering the city, which made us determined to stay at our posts and perform our duties with peace of mind." The Kong Family Cemetery (Kong Lin) north of the city had been severely damaged because several thousand people, including the KMT's "Home Return Corps," had been living there. The KMT troops built bunkers everywhere in the Kong Lin, felled many pine and cypress trees, and defecated everywhere, even on Confucius's tomb. Many doors and windows in the Yan Temple and Yan Mansion in the north gate of Qufu had been dismantled by the KMT troops for firewood. The railings and wisteria trellises of the Lu Pan Pond (Lu Gong), a Zhou Dynasty site in the south gate, were destroyed by the KMT’s Reorganized 11th Division and Reorganized 64th Division last year and used for fortifications and firewood; this spring, the several acres of lotus roots were uprooted and eaten by the Reorganized 12th Division. According to the pond keeper, "It will take at least five years for the pond lotus to recover from this destruction." The Confucius Temple in Qufu has magnificent architecture. The Dacheng Hall is eight zhang high and fourteen zhang wide. The temple contains buildings from various dynasties such as the Kuiwen Pavilion, as well as inscriptions and steles from the Han, Wei, Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties, and more than 100 stone carvings of the Zhou You Lie Guo Tu (Confucius Traveling Around the States) and portraits of Confucius, as well as historical relics such as the Apricot Altar and the cypress planted by Confucius himself. The Kong Lin, three miles north of the city, covers an area of 2,900 mu, with ancient cypress trees lining the roads and steles standing in forests. Confucius and his grandson Zisi are buried here. Inside the city are the Yan Temple and Lu Gong.

　　我军保护曲阜孔庙
    【新华社华东前线一日电】攻克曲阜战斗中，解放军对孔庙等古迹文物严加保护，孔府执事人员皆安心留守原职，留存之各种古物珍藏亦皆安然无损。进攻该城之部队于攻城前数日即颁发入城守则；十一日午夜打进东门后又一再命令各部在向纵深发展时，特别注意保护各古迹文物。当据守孔府之残敌被肃清后，攻击部队立即撤出城外，由指挥部指定之卫戌部队分别卫护各处古迹。战斗结束后该部并即派队整顿园林，将孔庙中的基道、驿亭等处打扫干净，正式开放参观。孔府执事人员说：“卫戌部队入城后马上出了布告，使我们拿定主意，安心各守其职。”城北孔林因原住有蒋军“还乡团”等数千人，已被破坏不堪。蒋军在孔林中到处修筑堡垒，砍伐了许多松柏；随地大便，即孔子墓上亦无幸免。曲阜北门颜庙、颜府内很多门窗已被蒋军拆作柴烧。南门周代遗迹鲁泮池（即鲁宫）的栏杆和紫藤架，在去年即被蒋军整十一师、整六十四师破坏了，作了工事和柴火；今春其几亩地的荷藕，又被整十二师拔光吃了。据看池人谈：“池藕经此摧残，起码五年才能恢复。”按曲阜孔庙建筑壮丽，大成殿高八丈，宽十四丈，庙内有奎文阁等历代建筑，以及汉、魏、隋、唐、宋等朝之赞赋、碑碣，与石刻之周游列国图、孔子像等，共一百余方，并有杏坛、孔子手植之桧等古迹遗物。城北三里的孔林占地二千九百亩，古柏夹道，碑碣林立，孔子及其孙子思墓均在此。城内则有颜庙及鲁宫。
