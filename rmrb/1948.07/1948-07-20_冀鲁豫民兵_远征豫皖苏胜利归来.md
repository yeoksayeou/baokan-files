Until their return on June 23rd of this year, a period of five months and ten days, their morale remained high throughout. Starting from March 15th, they followed the army in battles in fifteen counties including Taihe, Taikang, and Luyi, marching continuously for twenty-four days, covering at least 70 *li* each day, without complaint. Militiamen Hu Zhaofa, Hu Zhi, and others from the Fourth Company often carried loads weighing 70 *jin*. On April 28th, the militiamen participated in breaking the Longhai Railway. The eighty-five men of the Fourth Company alone broke over 20 *li* of road in one day and night. In the lulls between battles, they also helped the masses with weeding and manure spreading. In villages such as Liulou and Laolongce in Taikang, they helped the masses weed over 600 *mu* of sorghum seedlings and spread over twenty large carts of manure, spreading the manure in the sorghum fields. Before returning home this time, commendations were given, and many people received certificates of merit, filled with joy.
