　　【Jizhong Electric】A spokesperson for the Jizhong Military Region Command recently issued a stern warning regarding the criminal acts of the Jiang and Fu bandit gangs in breaching dikes and releasing water, inundating peaceful residents in the Jizhong Liberated Area. The spokesperson stated: Since the beginning of spring, in the wake of disastrous defeats, the Jiang and Fu bandit gangs have continuously breached dikes on the Grand Canal, Daqing River, and Ziya River, releasing water to harm peaceful residents in the Liberated Area. On February 8th this year, Jiang's bandits breached the Grand Canal dike south of Wangjiaying Village, north of Jinghai City. The democratic government fully led the people in rushing to plug the breach, but due to continuous sabotage by Jiang's bandits, it has not been plugged to this day. On March 4th, Jiang's bandits dug several breaches, five zhang wide and eight chi deep, near villages such as Lijiawanzi, Erbao, and Sanbao on the banks of the Ziya River, plotting to inundate over eighty villages in the Jiakouwa area (this area is located south of Duliu, east of the Ziya River, west of the Grand Canal, and north of Zhouzhuangzi and Jiakou in Jinghai). Our democratic government and the People's Liberation Army led and assisted the people in rushing to plug the breaches day and night, finally plugging the breaches in Erbao, Sanbao, and other villages. The breach in Lijiawanzi has not been properly plugged to this day due to constant obstruction by Jiang's bandits. In February of this year, the Jiang and Fu bandits built two water barriers on the Daqing River north of Taitou Village, causing the river water to flow backward, flooding and destroying three thousand qing of wheat fields in Taitou and Huangcha. On April 3rd, Jiang's bandits breached the dike of the Ge Dian (separating the river from a depression) in three locations between @li (south bank of the Daqing River) and Tongshigou (north bank of the Daqing River). In early February, Jiang's bandits breached the Shuishui River mouth in Wen'anwa (this river mouth belongs to Jinghai and was built by the democratic government in 1945; it can divert water from Wen'anwa into the Ziya River). The democratic government led the local people in rushing to repair it three times, but all were sabotaged by Jiang's bandits. As a result, the water in Wen'anwa rose sharply, most of the spring wheat was flooded, and 210,000 mu of land that had been drained could not be cultivated for a time. The democratic government, in coordination with the People's Liberation Army, led the people in rushing to repair it again, and it was finally completed on June 8th.

    The spokesperson stated: The Jiang bandits' conspiracy to breach dikes and release water did not begin this year. On August 6th of last year, under the unified command of Jiang's bandit chief Shangguan Yunxiang, they breached the south dike of the Grand Canal in the village of Liuhezhen (south of Jinghai) with a breach twelve zhang wide and one zhang six chi deep. The river water poured into Jiakouwa, and eighty-three villages and 498,000 mu of autumn fields in that area were flooded. The democratic government led the local masses in rushing to plug the breach four times, but all were sabotaged by Jiang's bandits. Our army liberated Liuhezhen in December of last year and finally repaired the breach. After that, Jiang's bandits blocked the downstream Babao sluice gate, preventing the river water from being discharged, and fifty-two villages in the area continued to suffer from flooding.

    The spokesperson stated: The rainy season is approaching early, and the flood season has arrived. The Jiang and Fu bandit gangs are preparing to breach dikes and release water on a large scale again, flooding hundreds of thousands of people in Jinghai, Wenxin, and other counties. Our army has a responsibility to protect the people, and we issue a stern warning to the Jiang and Fu bandit gangs: "If the Jiang and Fu bandit armies dare to continue breaching dikes and releasing water, harming the people, the Jiang and Fu bandits shall be responsible for the consequences." The spokesperson called on Party, government, military, and civilians in the border areas to be highly vigilant against the Jiang and Fu bandit gangs' conspiracy to breach dikes and release water. Armed forces in various areas should actively operate and strike at the Jiang and Fu bandit armies who dare to invade and breach dikes. All the people should unite to save themselves and wage a resolute struggle against the dike-breaching Jiang bandits.

　　冀中军区发言人
  　严重警告蒋傅匪帮再敢扒堤定予严惩
    【冀中电】冀中军区司令部发言人，顷对蒋、傅匪帮决堤放水，淹没冀中解放区和平居民之阴谋罪行，提出严重警告。发言人称：入春以来，蒋、傅匪帮于惨败之余，竟连续在运河、大清河、子牙河扒堤放水，淹害解放区和平居民。今年二月八日，蒋匪将静海城北王家营村南之运河堤扒开，民主政府全力领导人民抢堵，因蒋匪继续破坏，至今仍未堵住。三月四日，蒋匪在子牙河岸之李家湾子、二堡、三堡等村附近，掘开五丈宽、八尺深的决口数处，阴谋淹没贾口洼（该洼位于独流以南、子牙河以东、运河以西、静海之周庄子、贾口以北）八十余村。我民主政府和解放军领导与帮助人民日夜抢堵，始将二堡、三堡等村决口堵住，李家湾子决口由于蒋匪不断阻扰，迄今仍未堵好。今年二月间，蒋、傅匪在台头村北大清河上修拦水坝两道，使河水倒流，淹毁台头、黄岔麦田三千顷。四月三日，蒋匪又在＠里（大清河南岸）通石沟（大清河北岸）之隔淀堤决口三处。二月初，蒋匪将文安洼之泄水河口（该河口为静海属，为民主政府在民国三十四年所修，可引文安洼水入子牙河。）扒开，民主政府领导当地人民三次抢修，均被蒋匪破坏。结果文安洼水猛涨，春麦大都淹没，已脱水的二十一万亩土地一时亦不能耕种。民主政府配合解放军领导人民再次抢修，在六月八日始告竣工。
    发言人称：蒋匪扒堤放水之阴谋罪行并非自今年始，去年八月六日，蒋匪在罪魁上官云相统一指挥下，将流河镇（静海以南）村南之运河南堤扒开宽十二丈，深丈六的决口，河水灌入贾口洼，该洼八十三个村庄、四十九万八千亩秋田均被淹没。民主政府领导当地群众四次抢堵，均被蒋匪破坏。我军在去年十二月解放流河镇，始将决口修好，其后蒋匪又将下游八堡闸口堵塞，河水不能排泄，该洼五十二个村庄继续遭受水灾。
    发言人称：现雨季早临，汛期已到，蒋傅匪帮又准备大肆决堤放水，淹我静海、文新等县数十万人民。本军卫民有责，特严重警告蒋傅匪帮：“如蒋傅匪军胆敢继续扒堤放水，淹害人民，其后果均应由蒋傅匪负责。”发言人号召边缘区党政军民高度警惕蒋傅匪帮决堤放水之阴谋，各地武装应积极活动，打击胆敢出犯扒堤之蒋傅匪军。全体人民应团结自救，与扒堤蒋匪作坚决斗争。
