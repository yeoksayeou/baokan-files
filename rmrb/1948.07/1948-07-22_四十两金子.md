　　Forty Taels of Gold
    Yang Shuo
    On June 14th, the People's Liberation Army launched a surprise attack on Zhenzi Town, located on the side of the Beining Railway north of Tangshan in eastern Hebei, annihilating the entire First Battalion of the 451st Regiment of the 151st Division of the enemy's 62nd Army. When the People's Liberation Army was inspecting the captured weapons, they felt something hard and bulky wrapped around the waist of Wang Shangbin, the enemy's Major Battalion Commander. Wang Shangbin's face immediately turned pale, and he stammered, "This is a little gold." It wasn't a little, but a full forty taels: gold bars, gold ingots, and gold leaves of various types. This was a private fortune he had painstakingly accumulated during his five years as battalion commander. Actually, it wasn't surprising; according to prisoners, Tao Xiangfu, the commander of the 451st Regiment, had likely amassed four or five hundred taels of gold. These Jiang family officers valued gold as much as their lives. When the artillery fire intensified, Wang Shangbin hadn't forgotten to quickly take out his treasure from the bottom of the box and strap it to his stomach, not expecting that at this moment, he would helplessly watch the People's Liberation Army soldier who was inspecting him find his gold. His heart felt as if it were being cut out, and he assumed that everything was over. However, after the People's Liberation Army soldier finished inspecting, he calmly handed it back to him, saying, "Keep it with you, no one will touch it!" He simply couldn't believe it was true. How could the People's Liberation Army be so indifferent to the gold that Jiang family soldiers coveted? Harboring ulterior motives, he was transferred from the front lines to the rear, but no one ever touched his gold. In early July, just as he had come, he was safely released by the People's Liberation Army with his forty taels of gold, not a bit missing. Only then did he realize with great emotion that while gold was valuable, there was something even more noble than gold in the People's Liberation Army: this was the solemn revolutionary discipline, which included the discipline of treating prisoners of war with leniency, and within the discipline of treating prisoners of war with leniency, there was a rule that "private property of prisoners will not be confiscated."

　　四十两金子
    杨朔
    六月十四日，解放军奇袭冀东唐山北面北宁路侧的榛子镇，守敌六十二军一五一师四五一团一营全部被歼。解放军动手检查俘获的武器时，一摸摸到敌少校营长王尚斌的腰下缠着些硬绑梆的东西，王尚斌立时脸色苍白，嗫嚅着说：“这是一点金子。”不是一点，而是足足有四十两重：金条、金锭、金叶子各色齐全。这是他当五年营长期间用尽心机捞的一笔私财。其实也不稀奇，据俘虏说，四五一团团长陶相甫搜刮的金子怕有四五百两。这些蒋家军官，把金子看得和命一样重。当王尚斌在炮火紧时，还没有忘记从箱子底层赶快拿出他的宝藏，贴身绑到肚皮上，不想此刻竟眼睁睁地望着那个检查他的解放军战士搜出了他的金子，一颗心就象叫人剜去似的伤痛，料定什么都完了。可是那个解放军战士检查完后，神色不动的重新递给他说：“你带着吧，没人动你的！”他简直不敢相信这是真的，怎么蒋家官兵看得眼红的金子，解放军会看得那样淡漠？怀着鬼胎从前线被转送到后方，但始终没人动他的金子。七月初，他象来时一样，带着四十两金子，分毫不缺，安安全全地被解放军释放了，他这才大大感动地看清一件事实：金子虽然值钱，但在解放军里却有比金子更加高贵的东西，这就是庄严的革命纪律，这里包括优待俘虏的纪律，而在优待俘虏纪律里，正有一条是“不没收俘虏的私人财产”。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【冀东电】
