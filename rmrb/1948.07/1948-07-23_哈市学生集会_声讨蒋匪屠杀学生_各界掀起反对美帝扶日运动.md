Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 19th: Following the news of the "July 5th" tragedy in Beiping, students in Harbin were filled with grief and indignation at the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit gang's massacre of their fellow students from the Northeast. The city's Student Union and the Mao Zedong Youth League jointly held a city-wide youth student meeting on the 13th to denounce the Chiang bandits' crimes of slaughtering students from the Northeast. More than 8,000 students from six middle schools in Harbin, as well as Worker's Middle School, Northeast Academy of Sciences, Xingzhi Normal School, Youth Cadre School, Finance and Economics Cadre School, and Postal and Telecommunications School, as well as young workers and staff from various factories, attended the meeting.范桂奇, a student representative from Harbin No. 1 Middle School and chairman of the meeting, reported on the events of the "July 5th" incident, and then proposed that all students in Harbin should intensify their work and study, vowing to avenge the students who died in the "July 5th" tragedy. The meeting then invited Mayor Zhu Qiwen to speak. He emphasized that the disasters suffered by the people of the Northeast for the past 20 years were inseparable from Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek had always treated the people of the Northeast as "uncivilized people," discriminating against, excluding, selling out, and even slaughtering them. The history of 20 years proves that as long as Chiang Kai-shek's rule exists, there will be no democratic, free, and happy life for young people. This time, thousands of students from the Northeast, deceived and coerced by Chiang Kai-shek, traveled from Changchun and Jilin to Shenyang, from Shenyang to Beiping, wandering around and being persecuted everywhere, and finally suffering massacre. This is a loss for the people of the Northeast, and the youth of the Northeast should avenge them and demand blood debts from Chiang Kai-shek. The liberated areas of the Northeast welcome students from the Chiang-controlled areas to come to the liberated areas to study and work, and jointly overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and build a new Northeast. After Mayor Zhu's speech, Chen Guangrui and Liu Guozeng, students who had just escaped from the Chiang-controlled areas to Harbin and are now studying at the Northeast Academy of Sciences and the Youth Cadre School, reported on their personal experiences of being deceived and persecuted by the Northeast Chiang government authorities against young students, arousing uncontrollable anger among the students at the meeting. Slogans such as "Fight to Nanjing! Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" and "Down with Chiang Kai-shek! Establish a New China!" resounded for a long time. The meeting finally sent a telegram to youth and students across the country, declaring: "The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has made the people of the Northeast suffer 14 years of colonial life, and now it is colluding with U.S. imperialism, using American bullets to massacre students from the Northeast. We must resolutely rise up and fight the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to the end. The fresh blood of the 'July 5th' tragedy cannot be shed in vain, and this blood debt must be repaid by the executioners Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi. We, the students in the liberated areas of the Northeast, vow to take practical actions to resolutely support your struggle against persecution until the final victory is achieved."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 17th: People from all walks of life in Harbin have launched a movement against U.S. imperialism's support for Japan. On the morning of the 9th, representatives from 106 industries in Harbin's business community held a special current affairs forum in the auditorium of the Federation of Industry and Commerce to discuss the issue of U.S. imperialism supporting Japan. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely激昂 (激昂: impassioned/aroused). Liu Peizhi, chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance caused the people of the Northeast to suffer 14 years of national subjugation. Today, Chiang Kai-shek is again colluding with U.S. imperialism to support Japan's resurgence, attempting to plunge the people of the Northeast and China into a deep abyss of suffering again. We vow to oppose it to the death." Wang Ming, manager of Taihe Company, said: "We cannot forget the bloody facts of the Japanese invaders' massacre of the people of the Northeast after the September 18th Incident. It has been less than three years since Chairman Mao led us to defeat the Japanese invaders, and now the U.S. and Chiang are supporting Japan's armed resurgence. The Chinese people will never tolerate it." Wu Baizhen, a giant in Harbin's business community, said: "Today, under the leadership of the democratic government, we must improve the quality of our products to resist the economic aggression of U.S. imperialism." The meeting also passed a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters in the liberated areas across the country to express their respect. Large and small schools throughout the city, the Harbin Mao Zedong Youth League, and factory workers also held meetings around the "July 7th" anniversary to oppose the U.S. plot to support Japan's resurgence. More than 50 primary schools in Harbin sent a telegram to children across the country on the "July 7th" memorial day, saying: "We must not, after defeating the evil Japanese imperialism and the puppet Puyi, endure all the oppression and insults imposed on the children of our new China by the U.S. and Chiang. We firmly believe that the power of the people will surely defeat any reactionaries and establish an independent, free, and happy new China under the leadership of the Communist Party!"
