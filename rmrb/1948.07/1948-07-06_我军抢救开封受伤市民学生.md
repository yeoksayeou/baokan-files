Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 3rd – When Chiang's planes indiscriminately bombed Kaifeng, the People's Liberation Army made every effort to rescue the victimized civilians and students. Many citizens said with emotion, "The Kuomintang harmed us, but the People's Liberation Army saved us." The dressing stations of two regiments of a certain unit bandaged, changed dressings, and performed surgery for injured civilians non-stop for two days. Due to the large number of civilians wounded by the bombing, many commanders and soldiers had to perform first aid bandaging on the spot. Before the People's Liberation Army had entered the city on the 18th, Chiang's planes had already begun bombing the city. Many students who had been driven into the city by Liu Maoen in advance were injured by the bombing. On the 19th, dozens of students from Ji-Bian Middle School were injured by the bombing. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army moved into the school that day and rescued them all from danger, sending them to a safe area.

　　我军抢救开封受伤市民学生
    【新华社开封前线三日电】当蒋机滥炸开封时，解放军曾尽最大努力抢救被害之市民学生等。许多市民感动的说：“国民党害了我们，解放军救了我们。”某部两个团的包扎所为受伤市民包扎、换药、开刀两天未停。由于被炸伤的市民众多，许多指战员都不得不就地进行急救包扎。十八日解放军尚未攻入城内前，蒋机即已开始向城内轰炸。被刘茂恩事先驱入城内的学生被炸伤甚多，十九日济汴中学即有数十学生被炸伤。幸解放军当日进驻该校，当将他们全部营救出险，送至安全地带。
