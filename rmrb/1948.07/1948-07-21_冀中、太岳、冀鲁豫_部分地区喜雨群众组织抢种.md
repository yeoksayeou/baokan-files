[Hebei Central Telegram] Most areas of Hebei Central region joyfully received welcomed rainfall. In the Eighth District, from June 29th to July 5th, there were three consecutive rainfalls, which have thoroughly soaked the soil. The Tenth District had a thorough rainfall on the 5th of this month. The Ninth District had three "finger-sized" rainfalls, and the eastern part of Suning County has been thoroughly soaked. In the Eleventh District, Xinji had a three "finger-sized" rainfall, and some areas of Shulu County have been thoroughly soaked. The masses are extremely excited and are rushing to plant crops.

[Taiyue Telegram] Several areas in the Taiyue region began to receive rainfall on the night of July 12th. By the 14th, Yangcheng's third, fourth, and sixth districts received about two inches of rainfall, and some areas have been thoroughly soaked. Qinshui, Jincheng, and Jiyuan received four "finger-sized" rainfalls. Except for some areas in the fourth and fifth districts of Gaoping which were not thoroughly soaked, the remaining districts all received thorough rainfall. Various localities are now organizing the masses to rush planting.

[Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 16th Telegram] In the Eighth District of the Hebei region of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, widespread rainfall occurred in Qingfeng, Nanle, Puyang, Shanghe, Kunwu and other counties, with rainfall sufficient for planting. Neihuang County received a three to four "finger-sized" rainfall on the 7th of this month. Rainfall in the Henan region is not widespread, and the amount of rainfall is uneven. Except for some villages east of Dingtao in the Fifth District which received three to four "finger-sized" rainfalls, the remaining counties are all suffering from drought. In the Second District, many areas have not been able to plant crops. Although there has been light rain recently, it is of no help.

In the Seventh District, Nanhua and Jiaxiang have had three rainfalls since the wheat harvest.

  　部分地区喜雨群众组织抢种
    【冀中电】冀中大部地区庆获喜雨。八分区自六月二十九日至七月五日，连续落雨三次，已经下透。十分区于本月五日落透雨。九分区先后落三指雨，肃宁东部地区已经落透。十一分区辛集落三指雨，束鹿有些地方已经下透。群众兴奋异常，正抢种中。
    【太岳电】太岳若干地区先后于七月十二日夜起开始降雨，截至十四日，阳城三、四、六区降雨约两寸，并有部分地区已经下透。沁水、晋城、济源降雨四指。高平除四、五区部分地区未下透外，其余各区都下了透雨。现各地正组织群众抢种中。
    【冀鲁豫十六日电】冀鲁豫河北地区八分区清丰、南乐、濮阳、尚和、昆吾等县普遍落雨，雨量已能下种。内黄县于本月七日落雨三、四指。河南地区落雨不普遍，雨量亦不平衡。五分区除定陶以东部分村庄下三四指雨外，其余县份均旱。二分区很多地区没耩上庄稼，最近虽下小雨，尚无济于事。三分区钜南南部下透雨，但系急风骤雨，树有被刮断者。七分区南华、嘉祥麦后已下三次雨。
