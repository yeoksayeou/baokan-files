　　Ten Days of Combat Annihilate 4,800 Enemies
　　Ambush 100,000 Enemy Reinforcements
　　Our Army on the Pinghan Line Successfully Completes Ambush Mission
    【Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 22nd】When the East China Liberation Army began to encircle and annihilate the enemy's Qu Shounian and Huang Botao corps in the Yudu area on June 16th, Chiang Kai-shek commanded five and a half divisions, eleven brigades, including Hu Lian's 18th Army, 28th Division, and Zhang Zhen's 10th Division, 85th Division, and 20th Division, totaling about 100,000 troops, attempting to reinforce from Queshan, Suiping, and Runan. However, on the 28th, they were stubbornly ambushed by our Pinghan Line troops on the Suiping-Xiping line. The enemy continuously launched fierce attacks on our positions, vainly attempting to drive our army away and open a path. But after four days of fighting, not only did they make no progress, but they also suffered heavy casualties from our continuous counterattacks. On the night of July 2nd, the enemy, unable to advance from the front, attempted to break away from our ambush and fled to Shangcai and its northeast, planning to detour through Shangshui and Zhoujiakou to advance north. Our army immediately launched a head-on ambush and pursued them, blocking the enemy in the area on both sides of the Shangcai-Shangshui highway after July 5th. On the 6th, the enemy's vanguard, the 11th Division, which had sneaked into Zhoujiakou, was also firmly ambushed by another unit of our army. On the 6th and 7th, the enemy launched continuous fierce attacks on our positions, but were repelled by us one by one, without taking a step forward. On the 8th, the enemy was forced to turn to the area east of Shangcai and west of Xiangcheng. At this time, most of the enemy's Qu Shounian Corps and part of Huang Botao Corps in the Yudu area had been annihilated, and our Pinghan Line troops successfully completed the task of guaranteeing the operations of the Longhai Line troops. In this ten-day battle, a total of more than 4,800 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, more than 319 enemy officers and soldiers were captured, 32 light and heavy machine guns, 33 submachine guns, 11 grenade launchers, 215 rifles and carbines, and 155,000 rounds of various bullets were seized.

　　作战十天歼敌四千八
  　阻击十万敌援兵
  　平汉我军圆满完成阻击任务
    【新华社中原前线二十二日电】当华东解放军六月十六日开始在豫东地区围歼敌区寿年及黄伯韬两兵团时，蒋介石曾以胡琏指挥十八军、二十八师、及张轸指挥第十师、八十五师、二十师等共五个半师、十一个旅，约十余万人兵力，企图由确山遂平汝南一带北援，但二十八日即在遂平、西平之线，遭我平汉线兵团顽强阻击，敌不断向我阵地猛攻，妄想驱逐我军打开道路，但经四天战斗，不仅毫无进展，且遭我连续反击，伤亡重大。七月二日夜敌以正面不能进展，乃企图脱离我之阻击，遂向上蔡及其东北窜犯，拟绕道经商水周家口北进，我军当一面迎头阻击，一面跟踪追击，于七月五日后阻敌于上蔡至商水公路两侧地区，六日窜占周家口之敌先头部队十一师亦遭另部我军坚决阻击，六、七两日敌连续向我阵地猛攻，均被我一一击退，未得前进一步。八日敌被迫转向上蔡以东项城以西地区，此时豫东敌区寿年兵团大部及黄伯韬兵团一部已被歼灭，我平汉线兵团圆满完成保障陇海线兵团作战任务。是役作战十日，共毙伤敌官兵四千八百余人，俘敌官兵三百一十九名，缴轻重机枪三十二挺，手提机枪三十三支，掷弹筒十一个，步马枪二百一十五支，各种子弹十五万五千发。
