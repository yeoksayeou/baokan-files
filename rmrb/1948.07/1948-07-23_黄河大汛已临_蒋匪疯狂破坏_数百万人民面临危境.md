[Urgent telegram from the Jiluyu (combination of Hebei, Shandong and Henan provinces) region on the 19th] The flood season has arrived, and the Yellow River's water level is critically high. The lives and property of millions of people in Henan are in grave danger due to the Chiang bandits' frenzied sabotage of our repair and defense work. In addition to U.S.- Chiang aircraft bombing our river defense works, villages, and repair personnel day and night, the Chiang bandits' 5th and 68th Divisions, in conjunction with local bandits, invaded all river defense works along a 300-mile stretch from Gaocun (under the jurisdiction of Dongming) in the west to Kunshan in the east on the 17th and 18th. They set fire to over 400,000 catties of straw materials for river management in Kunshan, and also looted straw from Jiangsu Dam. All repair workers were dispersed by the enemy, forcing the suspension of emergency repair projects. The water situation is now extremely critical, and if a breach occurs, dozens of counties in Henan will be turned into a watery realm. In order to prevent the Yellow River from breaching, the Jiluyu Yellow River Commission began to fully repair famous dangerous projects on the south bank of the Yellow River, such as Gaocun, Zhukou, Liuzhuang, and Jiangsu Dam, in late June. The dangerous projects above the twelve dams of Gaocun had already been repaired by us. On July 4, dangers arose at the 13th and 14th dams, and U.S.- Chiang aircraft took advantage of the situation to bomb these dangerous projects day and night, starting on the 7th, as many as fifteen times each night, killing and wounding a total of more than 150 repair workers and local people. Three of our large repair ships were also sunk. However, our Yellow River Commission's repair and defense office still led the workers to bravely repair day and night, risking enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, investing 400,000 bricks and 600,000-700,000 catties of willow branches. The 13th dam project was largely completed, and the 14th dam project was also completed to a basic height of 6.3 meters, making the dam 1.5 meters above the water surface, only about 1 meter away from completion. Unexpectedly, the Chiang bandits took advantage of this period to invade our dangerous projects in Gaocun, Kunshan, and other places, destroying our repair and defense work. If breaches occur at various dangerous projects as a result, the Chiang bandits should bear full responsibility for this heinous crime.

　　黄河大汛已临  蒋匪疯狂破坏
  　数百万人民面临危境
    【冀鲁豫十九日急电】大汛已临，黄河水势危急，河南数百万人民的生命财产，已因蒋匪之疯狂破坏我修防工作而面临危境。除美援蒋机昼夜轮番轰炸我沿河险工、村庄及修防员工外，蒋匪整五师、六十八师各一部，结合土顽，竟于十七、十八两日，先后侵占西起东明属高村，东至昆山，长达三百余里沿河所有险工，纵火烧毁我昆山治河秸料四十余万斤，江苏坝秸料也被抢走。所有抢修员工，均被敌打散，抢险工程，因之被迫停工。现水势极度危急，一旦决口，河南数十县份将尽成泽园。我冀鲁豫黄委会为防止黄河决口，自六月下旬开始，即全力抢修黄河南岸高村、朱口、刘庄、江苏坝等著名险工。高村十二坝以上险工本已为我修竣，七月四日，十三、十四两坝又发生危险，而美援蒋机竟趁火打劫，于七日起，日夜狂炸各该险工，多至每夜连续轰炸十五次，死伤抢修员工及当地群众共达一百五十余人，我抢修大船三只，也遭炸沉。但我黄委会修防处，仍率领员工冒着敌机之轰炸扫射，昼夜英勇抢修，投下砖四十万块，柳苫六七十万斤，十三坝工程遂告大体完成，十四坝工程，也已完成基本工程六公尺三，使坝高出水面一公尺半，只相差一公尺左右即可全部完工。不料蒋匪竟趁此时期，侵占我高村、昆山等地险工，破坏我修防工作。各地险工如因而决口，此滔天罪行应由蒋匪负完全责任。
