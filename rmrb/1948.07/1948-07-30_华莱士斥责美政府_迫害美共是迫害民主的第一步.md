　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 27th. According to TASS, Philadelphia, July 22nd: Wallace, the presidential candidate of the US Third Party, recently issued a statement to the press condemning the government's persecution of American Communist leaders, declaring, "Defending the civil rights of Communists is the first line of defense in defending the freedom of democratic people." He continued: "The histories of Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain have taught us that suppressing the Communist Party is only the first step in attacking the democratic rights of labor and national, racial, and political minorities." Wallace, in exposing the US government's purpose in persecuting the American Communist Party, stated: The government and members of both parties in Congress use arbitrary words to create headlines, use headlines to create terror, and use terror to maintain power. Their purpose is to prevent the opposition party from speaking out against the two parties' unanimous "tough" foreign policy. However, millions of Americans have expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's refusal to negotiate with the Soviet Union for a peaceful resolution of the current differences. Wallace predicted that under various fabricated pretexts, the US government would carry out further white terror and attacks on other minorities, as well as continuous attacks on the New Party. Wallace concluded: "I personally am very hostile to the current actions of the government and both parties. The New Party will continue to fight to defend the constitutional freedoms of all Americans."

　　华莱士斥责美政府
  　迫害美共是迫害民主的第一步
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据塔斯社费城二十二日讯：美第三党总统候选人华莱士顷向报界发表声明，谴责政府对美共领袖的迫害时宣称：“保卫共产党人的公民权利，也即是保卫民主人民自由的第一道防线。”他继称：“德、意、日及西班牙的历史教育了我们：镇压共产党只是进攻劳工以及民族、种族、政治上少数派之民主权利的第一步。”华氏于揭露美政府迫害美共的目的时称：政府和国会中的两党议员用武断之词来制造头条新闻，用头条新闻来制造恐怖，用恐怖来保持政权，其目的就是不准反对党对两党一致的“强硬”外交政策说话。但是，千百万美国人对于政府拒绝与苏联谈判以和平解决现在纷歧一事，表示了他们的不满。华氏预料：美政府在各种捏造的借口下，还会有进一步的白色恐怖和对其他少数派的进攻，还会有对新党的不断进攻。华氏结语称：“我个人对政府和两党目前的许多行为，甚为敌视。新党将继续为保卫全体美国人载诸宪法的自由而斗争。”
