　　苏联工业生产率迅速增长
    提前完成上半年计划
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社报导：千百万的苏联工人，在忘我的社会主义竞赛中，已提前完成了今年上半年的生产计划。莫斯科市和州的全部工业，于六月二十三日先期完成了头六个月的总生产计划，生产了大量的煤、泥炭、钢、铜、列车、引擎、轮胎、农业机器、纺织品、食品等等。列宁格勒除一个区外，其他各区都于六月二十七日超过了六个月的生产计划。哈尔科夫、基辅·塔林、里加、沃罗涅兹、顿尼兹盆地、乌拉尔与全国其他工业中心，也都完成或超过了头六个月的生产计划。今年的特点是生产率的迅速增长。乌拉尔的许多钢铁厂，已经达到一九五○年的生产率；南部钢铁厂的铣铁产量，较去年同期增加百分之六十一，钢百分之八十一，卷金属百分之九十；顿尼兹盆地最大的“斯大林哥尔”煤矿托拉斯，今年上半年的产量超过去年同期百分之二十七；在重建中的克里沃罗格盆地，铁苗产额较去年同期增加百分之四十九。以莫斯科、列宁格勒为首的各工业中心的工人，现在正朝着在十月革命三十一周年纪念日完成第三年生产计划的目标前进。
