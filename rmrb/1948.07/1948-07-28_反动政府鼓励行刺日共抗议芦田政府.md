　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 25th: TASS reports: The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) lodged a strong protest with the government on the 20th regarding the assassination attempt on JCP General Secretary Tokuda Kyuichi. The protest was delivered to Cabinet Secretary-General Tomabechi Gizo at the Prime Minister's official residence by House of Representatives member Nosaka Sanzo (i.e., Okano Susumu) and House of Councillors member Hosokawa. The JCP accused the government's policies of encouraging and provoking the assassination attempt on Tokuda and demanded severe punishment for the criminals. The National Railway Workers' Union declared: The assassination attempt on Tokuda is a challenge to the Japanese democratic front. Railway workers expressed their firm determination to fight back against fascist terror. The Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Organizations declared that the assassination attempt on Tokuda is of the same nature as the recent assassination attempt on Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti. The federation believes that this rebellious attack is a fascist offensive against the Japanese democratic movement, and the Ashida government should be held responsible for the assassination attempt on Tokuda. The chairman of the Japan Farmers' Union also condemned the Ashida government for being responsible for this act.

　　反动政府鼓励行刺日共抗议芦田政府
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社报导：日共于二十日就日共总书记德田球一遇剌事向政府提出强烈抗议。抗议系由众院议员野坂参三（即冈野进）及参院议员细川于首相官邸递交内阁书记长苫米地义三。日共指责政府的政策鼓励和挑起了对德田的行刺，并要求严惩罪犯。国营铁道工人工会宣称：对德田行剌即是向日本民主阵线挑战。铁道工人表示：他们有坚定的决心给予法西斯恐怖以反击。日本产业劳动组合联合会宣称，对德田的行刺，是和最近对意共总书记托格里亚蒂的行刺具有同一性质。该联合会认为，这一叛逆的打击，即是法西斯分子对日本民主运动的攻势，芦田政府应对德田遇刺之事负责。日本农民联盟的主席，亦曾谴责芦田政府应对这一行为负责。
