Beiyue News: Dizhuang Village, Fourth District of Guangling, after conducting household-by-household investigations and exposing the village cadres' exaggeration of the disaster situation, overcame the ideological barrier of relying solely on government relief, and launched a mass movement of mutual lending and assistance, thus overcoming the famine. The village has a total of 203 households, with 5,436 mu of irrigated and dry sloping land and 20 head of livestock. Due to the poor harvest last year, a famine occurred, but compared with other disaster-stricken villages in the district, it was not particularly severe. Some cadres, such as the branch secretary, security officer, and brigade cadres, harbored the idea of solely relying on government relief. In order to obtain grain and loans, they led and organized more than 30 people to go to the district to request relief, exaggerating and fabricating the disaster situation, claiming that 50 to 60 households in the village were begging for food. The county sent a working group to the village, on the one hand, to show the government's attitude of being responsible for solving the famine, and on the other hand, to conduct in-depth investigations and register each household. It was found that among the 203 households in the village, 25 households had surplus grain (generally 10 to 15 large dou, and the most 20 to 25 large dou), 54 households had enough to eat, 94 households were short for one to two months (but they had the ability to solve it themselves), and 30 households were short of grain for more than three months. Based on this specific situation, the working group immediately conducted publicity and explanation among the village cadres, criticized their mistake of exaggerating the disaster situation and concealing it from the higher authorities, and decided to remove the brigade cadre who was mainly responsible for this matter from his post. The working group pointed out that to overcome the famine in the village, it should promote mutual assistance and lending, organize the masses to produce and conserve, overcome difficulties, and not simply rely on the government. After discussing these opinions, the cadres understood and said: "We used to think that the government had a lot of things. When we saw that other villages had grain and loans but our village didn't, we were jealous, and we didn't think it was wrong!" Later, after calculation, they unanimously believed that relying on their own village, they had the full strength to solve the famine. Then, a mass meeting of the whole village was held to mobilize production and conservation, mutual assistance and lending to overcome the famine. Slogans such as "A little water flows long" and "Eat less, drink more porridge, mix bran and vegetables to replace grain" were put forward, calling on everyone to help and lend to each other freely and voluntarily. On the spot, the grain and fodder committee member Tang Wen voluntarily took out five small dou of grain, and the squad leader and security officer each took out two small dou. Under the influence of the cadres taking the lead, Tang Yuan took out 60,500 border currency. He Qing said: "I have salt brought back, and I am willing to give out 14 jin to help poor people eat vegetables." A total of 45 households lent out 57 small dou of miscellaneous grains, 14 jin of salt, 60 jin of yam, and 120,500 border currency, which were distributed to the 30 households that lacked grain after everyone's discussion. The masses reflected: "Everyone is satisfied with this. If they don't have anything to eat in the future, everyone will find a way." After the meeting, women and children were mobilized to pick wild vegetables. An average of 160 people went out to pick vegetables every day, and 3,200 jin could be collected every day, which greatly solved the difficulty of grain shortage. Now the masses' emotions are stable, and they are actively producing. The land has been fully sown, and weeding work is in progress. (Du Fa)

Yanggao News: Zhao Shizhuang in Yanggao's Second District is a large village with 371 households and 130 qing of cultivated land. Last year, it suffered from both drought and insect plagues, resulting in a poor harvest. In addition, the bandits of Yan Chuan robbed the village twice, causing a serious disaster. According to statistics, 35 households are currently unable to make ends meet, and a total of 145 households lack food. This spring, after sowing, there was a heavy rain, and most of the sorghum and sesame seeds could not sprout, which made the masses extremely uneasy. After discovering the disaster situation, the government first loaned 768 jin of seeds and organized the masses to rush to replant 400 mu, stabilizing the masses' production emotions. Then, 40 bolts of cloth were loaned to the disaster victims for transportation and sales, and a mass mutual assistance and self-salvation movement was launched. The whole village donated a total of 1.8 shi of miscellaneous grains, 300 jin of yam, and 5 bolts of homemade cloth, which were distributed to the 13 poorest households, and everyone was organized to produce. At present, except for five disabled households who are still in difficulty, the lives of other disaster victims have been initially resolved. (Qi Tingxiu, Li Zhiyuan)

　　打破依赖思想发扬互借互济
    广灵底庄村克服灾荒
    【北岳讯】广灵四区底庄村经逐户调查，揭破村干夸大灾情，克服依赖政府救济的思想障碍后，开展群众互借互助运动，渡过了灾荒。该村共二○三户，有水旱坡地五四三六亩，牲畜二十头。由于去年农业歉收，发生灾荒，但与全区其他受灾村庄比较，并不十分困难。支书、治安员、大队干部等部分干部存有单纯依赖政府救济的思想，为获得贷粮贷款，遂领导组织了三十多人，去区上请求救济，并夸大与伪造灾情，说该村有五、六十户讨饭吃。县里派了工作组到该村一面表明政府负责解决灾荒的态度，一面深入调查，逐户登记，发现全村二○三户中现有余粮的共二十五户（一般余十至十五大斗，最多的二十至二十五大斗），够吃用的五四户，短一两个月的九四户（但自己有力解决），短三个月以上粮食的有三十户。工作组根据这一具体情况，立即在村干中进行宣传解释，批评他们夸大灾情瞒哄上级的错误，并决定将这件事的主要负责者大队干部撤职。工作组指出，该村克服灾荒，应该发扬互济互借组织群众生产节约，克服困难，不要单纯依靠公家。干部讨论了这些意见，想通以后说：“咱们以前认为公家东西多，看别村有贷粮贷款没给咱村，就眼红了，不想是错啦！”以后经过计算，一致认为依靠自己村庄，完全有力量解决灾荒困难。接着召开全村群众大会，动员生产节约，互济互借渡灾荒。提出了“细水长流过光景”，“少吃稠多喝稀，掺糠拌菜顶粮食”等口号，号召大家自由自愿互助互借。当场粮秣委员汤温自动拿出五小斗粮，中队长、治安员各拿出二小斗。在干部带头影响下，汤元拿出边币六万零五百元。何青说：“我有驮回的盐，愿出十四斤帮穷苦人吃菜。”总计四十五户借出杂粮五十七小斗，盐十四斤，山药六十斤，边币十二万零五百元，经大家讨论分借给缺粮的三十户。群众反映说：“照这样办谁都满意，以后他们没吃的，大家再想办法。”会后并发动妇女儿童挑野菜，平均每日有一百六十人外出挑菜，每日可收三千二百斤，大大解决了缺粮的困难。现群众情绪稳定，积极生产，土地已全部播种，锄苗工作正在进行。（杜发）
    【又讯】阳高赵石庄是阳高二区较大村庄，全村三七一户，种地一百三十顷。去年连遭旱虫两灾年景歉收，加上阎传匪两次抢劫，造成严重灾情。据统计眼下开不了锅的有卅五户，缺吃的共一四五户。今春下种后，下了一场大雨，大部高粱胡麻不能出苗，群众情绪极为不安。政府发现灾情后，首先贷给种子七百六十八斤，组织群众突击补种四百亩，稳定了群众的生产情绪。接着贷给灾民四十匹布搞运销，并发起群众互助互救运动，全村共乐捐杂粮一石八斗，山药三百斤，土布五匹，分给十三个最贫户，组织大家生产。现全村除五户残废尚有困难外，其他灾民生活已得初步解决。　　　　　　　（齐廷秀、李志远）
