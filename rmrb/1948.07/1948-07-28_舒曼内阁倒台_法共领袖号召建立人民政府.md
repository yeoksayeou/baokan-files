　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. TASS reports: French Communist leader Maurice Thorez addressed a mass rally of 30,000 working people in Paris on the 16th, calling for the establishment of a truly French government in France. Thorez pointed out: "We Communists will join hands with Socialists, Catholic party members, all working people, and sincere Republicans, and advance along this only correct path, so as to establish a truly French government in our country as soon as possible -- a government of democratic unity. In this government, the working class and its Communist Party will play their due role." At the conclusion of the mass rally, a resolution was unanimously passed demanding the termination of the activities of the internal war provocateur armed groups of de Gaulle's French People's Rally.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Various reports: The French Schuman government, led by the Popular Republican Movement, fell on the 19th. Schuman submitted his resignation after his military budget submitted to the parliament was cut. The original budget totaled 300 billion francs, while the Socialist Party demanded a reduction of 12 billion francs (equivalent to 40 million US dollars). The Schuman government had previously emphasized that it could not accept any reduction beyond 8.5 billion francs (which the cabinet had already decided to cut), and on the 17th, it demanded a vote of confidence in the government. However, on the 19th, the parliament finally passed the Socialist Party's amendment (i.e., a reduction of 12 billion francs) by 297 votes to 214. The 297 votes in favor of the amendment included 183 from the Communist Party, 101 from the Socialist Party, and 13 from the Democratic Socialist Union. Approximately 100 people abstained, including all members of the Liberal Republican Party, who are active supporters of de Gaulle. After the amendment was passed, Schuman resigned on behalf of the cabinet to President Auriol, which was approved by Auriol.

　　舒曼内阁倒台
  　法共领袖号召建立人民政府
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社报导：法共领袖多列士于十六日在三万劳动人民参加的巴黎群众大会上演说，号召在法国建立真正法国人的政府。多列士指出：“我们共产党人将和社会党人、天主教党人、一切劳动人民以及真诚的共和人士携手，沿着这条唯一正确的道路前进，以便尽快地在我国建立真正的法国人的政府——民主团结的政府。在这个政府中，工人阶级及其共产党将起他们应起的作用。”群众大会结束时，一致通过决议，要求终止戴高乐法国人民同盟内战挑拨者武装团体的活动。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：以人民共和运动党为首的法国舒曼政府已于十九日倒台。舒曼系于其提交议会的军事预算被削减后提出辞职，该预算原定总额为三千亿法郎，社会党则要求削减一百二十亿法郎（合四千万美元）。舒曼政府事前曾强调宣布不能接受任何超过八十五亿法郎（内阁已决定削减者）以外之削减，并于十七日要求对政府投信任票。但十九日议会终以二九七票对二一四票通过社会党的修正案（即削减一百二十亿法郎）。在上项修正案通过后，舒曼即代表内阁向总统阿里奥尔辞职，并已由阿里奥尔批准。在表决上项修正案之二九七票中，包括共产党一八三票，社会党一○一票，民主社会同盟十三票。弃权者约共一百票，包括戴高乐的积极拥护者——自由共和党的全部议员。
