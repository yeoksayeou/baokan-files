  　　　　　(I) Militia in the Border Area
    It was midnight on the twelfth, and the moon was about to set. Our troops had just emerged from the mountainous area of eastern Hebei and arrived at a small village at the foot of the mountains when we heard several gunshots, followed by the explosion of a hand grenade. Almost everyone whispered in unison, "It must be the work of special agents. Damn it!" The column did not stop, but moved slowly forward, detouring around some high ground and pools of water. Twenty minutes later, we finally entered a village. The village was extremely quiet, and not a single civilian came out. The courtyard we were assigned to had a gate made of straw and grass blocking the entrance. So everyone went in, woke up the owner, and used flashlights to look around to see if we could clear out a few rooms. Later, we found two rooms and went to sleep. However, no one had bothered to tell the people that we were the People's Liberation Army. The next day, we were still harboring the doubts of the night before. I asked the landlord, "Is this an enemy-occupied area?" She glanced at me and said, "Enemy-occupied area? This is the edge of the liberated area!" To this young woman, my words seemed to be a slander against her and her entire village. At this time, the sun had just risen, and the sound of artillery attacking Fengrun City was already booming. Later, I learned that due to the surprise nature of the troops' actions, no one knew that it was the People's Liberation Army who had come. The militia on sentry duty thought it was Chiang's bandits, so they fired their guns, and as a result, all the young and middle-aged men nearby ran away. A village cadre ran to a courtyard and, seeing vehicles everywhere, became anxious. Later, he heard a voice from the edge of the village saying, "Don't trample on the crops of the villagers!" Only then did he realize, "Could this be our own army?" An old woman in our courtyard said to me with a smile, "They asked me to come out and see if the hats were worn straight or crooked. The hats of the 'recruitment teams' and local bullies are all worn tilted, perched on top of their heads. But when you hit them with the 'electric baton,' I couldn't see anything clearly. Why didn't you say something? It scared them into running more than ten miles out of the village." I said, "The militia fired their guns, why didn't they hit them?" She smiled and said, "What can a few of them do? They can only give us a signal." Several young people in the room laughed. In fact, these militiamen had made heroic defenses. On the Tong(zhou)-Tang(shan) highway, they had captured eleven cars from Chiang's bandits; in Dongmazhuang, they shot down an enemy plane; and they used explosives to repel the invasion of four or five hundred Chiang's bandits and local bullies. The famous militia hero Liu Yong once led a platoon and defeated the attack of a platoon of Chiang's troops. All this happened not long ago. That very afternoon, our landlord's family, a family of "Eighth Route Army" members, all returned. One was a cadre in the village, one was working in the military region in a gray uniform and had returned home for recuperation half a month ago due to illness; one was a soldier in the local military corps, who had escorted prisoners back from Cuimazhuang that day and came home to visit. This family was very kind and amiable. They joined the revolutionary family to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang.
    　　　　(II) The Pride of the People
    The working people of a small village told us that although this is a plain, it is an old liberated area. Only one "big belly" (reactionary landlord) escaped from the whole village, and their work never lags behind. They talked a lot about the countless anecdotes that occurred during the Anti-Japanese War, saying that General Li Yunchang had to come to their village every year to hold a meeting and give a speech. Once again, I passed by a small village and stopped to rest and drink water under the shade of willows outside the village. I chatted casually with two farmers. I asked about the situation of joining the army. They said that there were more than a dozen military families in the whole village. I asked if anyone had joined the "Central Army," and they replied, "No." I asked again if anyone had joined the "big bellies," and they said, "Even less so." Their expressions were proud and reserved. I asked, "Is this an old area or a semi-old area?" He replied without hesitation, "Old liberated area." "How old?" I asked with a smile. "More than twenty years." I realized that this statement was not an exaggeration at all. Our working people will never forget the bloody struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique. These are things they take pride and glory in, and history is being written for the people's liberation.

　　北宁线见闻
    林间
  　　　　　（一）边缘区民兵
    十二日夜半，月亮快西沉了。我们部队从冀东山地走出，刚刚到山边的一个小庄子，就听到几声枪响，接着是一颗手榴弹的爆炸声，大家几乎不约而同的小声说：“准是特务捣鬼。他妈的！”队伍没有停止下来，绕着一些凸地和水池慢慢的前进。二十分钟后，终于走进了一个村子。这村子静极了，没有一个老百姓出来。我们被分配的一家院子门口，是一扇柴草扎成的栅栏挡着。于是大家走进去，叫醒了主人，用手电四处照，看能誊几间房子。后来找好两间房子就睡了。但，谁也忘记告诉老百姓，我们是人民解放军。第二天，我们还抱着昨夜的疑虑。我问房东：“你们这里是不是敌占区？”她瞧了我一眼说：“敌占区？我们这里是解放区的边边！”对于这个年轻的妇女来说，我的话似乎是诬蔑了她和她的全村。这时太阳刚刚出来，进攻丰润城的炮声已在轰隆轰隆的响了。后来我才知道：由于部队的奇袭动作，没有一个人知道来的是解放军。放哨的民兵，以为是蒋匪，于是就鸣了枪，结果四近的青壮年都跑了，一个村干部跑到一座院子，见四外都是车队，他急了，后来他听见村边上一个声音说：“别踏坏老乡的庄稼！”他这才醒悟了：“这会不是自己的军队么？”我们院里一位大娘，笑着向我说：“她们要我出来，看看帽子是正戴还是歪戴，“壮丁队”和地方土顽的帽子都偏戴着，扣在头顶上的。可是，你们用“电棒”一打，我就什么也看不清了。怎么你们不说一声呢？吓的他们一气跑出村外十多里地。”我说：“民兵不是开枪了么，怎么不打呢？”她笑着说：“他们几个人顶什么事，只能给我们个讯。”屋子里几个青年都笑了。其实，这些民兵是曾做过英勇的防卫的。他们在通（州）唐（山）公路上，曾经缴获了蒋匪十一辆汽车；在东马庄，打落了敌人一架飞机；用爆破击退了四五百蒋匪地方土顽的进犯。著名的民兵英雄刘勇，曾率领一个排，打垮蒋军一个排的进攻。这都不过是不久以前的事。就在这天下午，我们房东，一家子“八路军”都回来了。一个是在村里当干部，一个是穿着灰军装的，在军区工作，因为有病，半个月前才回家休养的；一个是在地方兵团当战士的，当天从崔马庄押送俘虏回来，顺便来看家，这一家人，都非常亲切和霭。他们为打倒蒋介石匪帮，走向了革命的大家庭。
    　　　　（二）人民的骄傲
    一个小村的劳动人民告诉我们，虽说这儿是平原，但却是老解放区。全村只有一个“大肚皮”（反动地主）逃了出去，工作从来不落人后。他们大谈其抗日战争时代发生的无数轶事，说李运昌将军每年都要到他们村召开一次会讲话。又一回，我路过一个小村，在村外柳荫下歇下来喝水，和两个农民随便聊天，我问起参军情形，他们说：全村有十几家军属。我问有没有参加“中央军”的，他们回答说：“没有”。我又问有没有参加“大肚皮”的，他们说：“那更没有”。表情骄傲和矜持。我又问：“你们这是老区还是半老区呢？”他不加考虑就回答说：“老解放区”。“多老了？”我笑着发问。“有二十多年”。我领悟了这句话是丝毫也没有夸大的。我们的劳动人民，永远不会忘记和蒋介石统治集团的血的斗争。这些，在他们是引以为光荣和骄傲的，历史是要为在人民的翻身史上。
