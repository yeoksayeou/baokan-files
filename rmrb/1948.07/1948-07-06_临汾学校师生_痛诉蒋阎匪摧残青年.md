Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 4th. Linfen teachers and students bitterly denounced the atrocities of the Chiang and Yan bandits in brutally oppressing intellectual youth. They accused the Chiang and Yan bandits of openly proposing "Rather sacrifice ten students than sacrifice one soldier." Teachers and students from six secondary schools in the city were forced to become soldiers or were driven to the front lines to build fortifications. Of the more than 1,000 teachers and students from Linfen Normal School, Linfen Middle School, and the Sanlian Middle School, 612 were forced into the bandit army's first echelon to charge on the front lines, and many made meaningless sacrifices. Those teachers and students who were not drafted into the bandit army were forced to build fortifications on the front lines day and night under the threat of bayonets; each person was given only two small steamed buns per meal, and the food sent by their families was snatched away by the bandit soldiers. Any slight delay in building the fortifications resulted in severe beatings or stabbings. Many teachers and young students fell ill as a result. Once, the Chiang and Yan bandits forced 100 teachers and students from Sanlian Middle School to carry 50 door panels to Dongguan to build fortifications, and only 50 people returned. Yang Jiechang, a 50-year-old teacher at the school, sacrificed his life on this occasion. These teachers and students, who bitterly accused the Chiang and Yan bandits of persecution to the Liberation Army, said with grief and indignation: "One door panel is worth one life. Yan Xishan propagandizes that the Liberation Army kills people, but it is he himself who is the killer."

　　临汾学校师生
    痛诉蒋阎匪摧残青年
    【新华社晋绥四日电】临汾教员和学生痛斥蒋阎匪摧残知识青年的暴行。他们控诉说：蒋阎匪曾公然提出“宁愿牺牲十个学生，不能牺牲一个士兵”。该城六个中等学校的师生都被强迫当兵，或者被赶上火线修筑工事。临师、临中、三联三个中学共师生千余人，就有六百十二人被迫编入匪军第一梯队在第一线冲锋，许多人作了无谓牺牲。未编入匪军之师生则在刺刀威胁下于最前线修筑工事，日夜不息；每人每顿饭只发两个小馒头，家里送的饭都被匪军抢走。修工事中动作稍有迟缓，即遭毒打或被刺杀。许多教员和青年学生因而病倒。有一次蒋阎匪强迫三联中师生一百人扛五十付门板到东关做工事，回来时只剩了五十人，该校五十余岁的老教员杨杰昌即于此次牺牲。这些向解放军痛诉蒋阎匪迫害的师生悲愤的说：“一块门板抵一条命，阎锡山宣传解放军杀人，而杀人的正是他自己。”
