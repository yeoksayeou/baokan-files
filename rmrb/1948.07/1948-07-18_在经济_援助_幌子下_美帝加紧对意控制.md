Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, Vienna dispatch: According to information obtained here, American infiltration into Italy is constantly increasing under the banner of economic "aid." In Rome, the United States is establishing a special agency to implement the Marshall Plan, which will employ as many as two thousand people. Under American pressure, the Italian government is secretly undermining the trade agreement between Italy and Poland. The delivery of 3,500 freight cars already approved for sale to Poland has been delayed. The United States is also transforming Italy into its military base. The airport outside Rome is being expanded and rebuilt under the supervision of the U.S. Army. The "Lira Fund" obtained from the reckless sale of American goods is being used by the Italian government to build highways and bridges of strategic importance to the U.S. government, as well as other "construction projects" of a similar nature.

　　在经济“援助”幌子下
    美帝加紧对意控制
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社维也纳讯：据此间获得的消息称，美国在经济“援助”的旗帜下面，对意大利的渗入正在不断增加。在罗马，美国正在设立一个实现马歇尔计划的特种机构，要招雇的工作人员竟达两千人。在美国压力下，意政府正在暗中破坏意波之间的贸易协定，已批准售给波兰的三千五百辆货车，已被延宕交付。美国又正在变意大利为其军事基地。罗马郊外的机场，正在美陆军监督下扩大与重建。肆意出售美货所得的“里拉（意币）基金”，正由意政府用来修建美政府认为有重要战略意义的公路与桥梁，及其他同类性质的“建筑计划”。
