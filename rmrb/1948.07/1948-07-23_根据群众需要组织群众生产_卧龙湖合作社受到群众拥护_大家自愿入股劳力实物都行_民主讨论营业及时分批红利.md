[Chahar News] Organizing the masses to engage in production based on local specific conditions and starting from the needs of the masses will win the support of the masses, and one's own business can gradually develop. Conversely, it will certainly cause dissatisfaction and opposition from the masses. The two cooperatives in Ma'an Village, Fangshan, most clearly prove this principle. Ma'an Village is the most scattered village in the Second District, consisting of six natural villages. There are two cooperatives in the village: Wolonghu and Ma'an Village. When the Wolonghu Cooperative was established last year, it faced many difficulties. It had no capital, no houses, and no furniture, and the confidence of cadres and the masses was not high. After slow research, it was decided that without capital, the masses could be absorbed to invest in kind, such as peppercorns, persimmons, chicken eggs, etc. All physical objects would be converted at market prices, ensuring that the common people would not suffer losses; if they could not build houses, they would call on everyone to invest in labor shares, with each work day calculated as 10,000 yuan (border currency, same below) in shares; the poorest households who had nothing could also cut mountain grass for covering persimmons and convert it into shares. Using these methods, the Wolonghu Cooperative began to be established. At that time, there were a total of 72 members, with 127 shares (each share worth 50,000 yuan). At this time, the shares were all in kind and labor, with no cash at all, making it difficult to operate. In order to support them, the state-owned store invested 4 million yuan in the cooperative. In addition, the government-issued loan of 2 million yuan was also placed in the cooperative as shares (it is not clear what kind of loan this 2 million yuan was, or to whom it was lent. If it was lent to the masses, it would be inappropriate to put it all in the cooperative. It should be lent to households in difficulty, allowing them to dispose of it freely, either to invest in shares or to engage in other production—Editor), totaling 6 million yuan. With money, business started. At first, the method of bartering was adopted, exchanging the peppercorns, persimmons, walnuts, cashmere, and wool invested by the masses for coal and jujube branches, and then transporting the coal and jujube branches out of the mountains to exchange for the daily necessities needed by the masses. After earning money, they went to Yi County to buy some cloth and daily necessities, and called on the masses to dig up medicinal materials for exchange, and the prices of these daily necessities were set cheaper than in other places. The collected Bupleurum, Platycodon, Polygala, Saposhnikovia and other medicinal materials were uniformly handed over to the store for consignment sales. From October last year to May this year, a total profit of 10,051,600 yuan was obtained. The cooperative not only supplied the daily necessities of the masses, but more importantly, it drove the production of the masses and solved most of the famine problems. This spring, the income from jujube branches and Bupleurum alone was 25,650,000 yuan, enabling the masses to buy about 90 dan of corn. Gong Defu and Gong Fulin, poor peasants in Dachunhu, could not even afford cotton clothes every winter. After the establishment of this cooperative, they seized every opportunity, getting up early and going to bed late to dig up medicinal materials. Not only did they wear cotton clothes last year, but also solved all the problems of summer clothes this year. Jin Guoquan had no money to invest in shares. When the cooperative built houses, he invested ten work days in labor shares, worth 50,000 ocean, and another 150,000 yuan in persimmons, totaling 200,000 yuan. When dividends were distributed at the end of March, he received a total of 210,000 yuan and bought one dan of corn. He planned to add some wheat of his own and dig up some medicinal materials to solve the living problems of his family of six for two months. Xin Derong, a military dependent, under the promotion of the cooperative, chopped more than 100 catties of firewood every day, and also dug up medicinal materials and weaved baskets for carrying when herding sheep, and automatically declined preferential treatment. Because this cooperative helped everyone solve their living problems, the masses supported it very much. The masses in Dongxi Taiping, Ma'an and Luzishui, Tang'er Shang, Bao'er Shui, Yihe Village, Wuhe Village and other places in the First District all came to this cooperative to buy things, and many masses who had not invested in shares in the past came to invest in shares. There are three main reasons why this cooperative can win the support of the masses: (1) It can organize the masses to engage in production according to actual conditions, solve the difficulties of the masses, and help the masses overcome the famine. (2) The leadership fully promoted democracy, and everyone studied how to conduct business. Since October last year, four shareholders' meetings have been held, and non-shareholding masses have been invited to participate and listen to their opinions. What business should be carried out in each season, and the prices of goods, are all decided at the shareholders' meeting. (3) Dividends are distributed in a timely manner to dispel the ideological concerns of the masses. From October last year to March this year, many people went to the cooperative to borrow salt and cloth. Some people were not sure whether the cooperative would make money, and they doubted the cooperative, asking to withdraw their shares, and some asked to withdraw their shares to pay off debts. At this time, the cooperative promptly settled the accounts and distributed dividends, with each 10,000 yuan earning a dividend of 10,500 yuan. The concerns of the masses were dispelled. Some used the dividends to pay off their debts, and some reinvested the principal and interest. The masses all said that this cooperative is "a cooperative that truly does good things for the people!"

The cooperative in Ma'an Village was set up to cope with the higher authorities by forcibly collecting 5.6 million yuan in physical shares. In addition to selling some cloth, mats, wine, cigarettes and other things, there was no other business. When the accounts were settled this year, 7,000 yuan was also earned for every 10,000 yuan, but the cooperative was afraid that the masses would freely dispose of the dividends, so it ordered that no dividends should be withdrawn. In the spring, the masses were very difficult and needed money most, but they could not withdraw money from the cooperative. The cooperative did not care about the living problems of the masses, nor did it try to organize the masses to engage in production. There are four non-working cadres working in the cooperative, and the masses feel that they can't do much work, and they don't go to work, and they are very dissatisfied that they are divided into three shares when they make money. Many masses asked to withdraw their shares and disband this cooperative.

　　根据群众需要组织群众生产
  　卧龙湖合作社受到群众拥护
  　大家自愿入股劳力实物都行
  　民主讨论营业及时分批红利
    【察哈尔讯】根据当地具体情况，从群众需要出发，组织群众进行生产，就能获得群众拥护，自己的业务也可逐步发展。反之一定引起群众的不满和反对。房山马安村的两个合作社，最明显的证实了这一原则。马安村是二区最分散的一个村庄，由六个自然村组成。村里有卧龙湖马安村两个合作社。去年卧龙湖合作社成立时困难挺多。既没股本又没房屋更没家具，干部群众的信心也不高。经过慢慢的研究，决定没有本钱可以吸收群众以实物如花椒、柿子、鸡子等入股，所有实物统按市价折算，一定不叫老百姓吃了亏；盖不起房则号召大家入劳力股，每个工算一万元（边币、下同）股金，没有劳动力的入些木料也折成股金；个别最穷的户什么也没有，也可割盖柿子用的山草折成股金。用了这些办法，卧龙湖合作社开始成立起来。当时共有社员七十二人，股金一百二十七股（每股合五万元）。这时的股金都是些实物和劳力，没有一个现钱，倒腾不开。公营商店为了扶植他们，向该社投资四百万元。另外还把政府发给的贷款二百万元也放在社里作了股金（这二百万元是什么贷款，贷给谁的，都未说清楚。如系贷给群众的，一律放在合作社就不妥当。应该贷给困难户，由他们自由处理，或入股，或搞其他生产——编者），共达六百万元。有了钱，生意就作开了。开始采用了以货换货的办法，把群众入股的花椒、柿子、核桃、羊绒、羊毛等物换成煤和荆条再把煤和荆条运到山外，换回群众日常必需的物品。赚了钱，又到易县买了一部分布和日用品，号召群众刨药材来掉换，这些日用必需品的价钱都比其他地方定得便宜些。收来的柴胡、桔梗、远志、防风等药材，则统一交商店代销。从去年十月到今年五月，共获利一千○五十一万六千元。合作社不仅供给了群众的日用品，更重要的是带动了群众的生产，解决了大部灾荒问题。今年春天仅条子、柴胡两项，就收了二千五百六十五万元，使群众能买玉米九十大石左右。大春湖贫农宫德甫、宫甫林，每年冬天连棉衣都穿不上，这个合作社成立以后，他们就抓紧一切空隙，起早睡晚的刨药材，不但去年穿上了棉衣，今年的夏服也全解决了。晋国全没钱入股，合作社盖房时入了十个工的劳力股，合洋五万元，另外又入了十五万元的柿子，共凑成二十万元。到三月底分红时，共分得了二十一万元，买了一石玉米，他计划再加上自己的一点小麦和刨些药材，全家六口人两个月的生活问题就解决了。军属辛德荣，在合作社推动下，每天打柴一百多斤，放羊时还刨药材编笼驮，自动谢绝了优待工。因为这个合作社帮助大家解决了生活问题，所以群众对他非常拥护。东西太平、马安和一区芦子水、堂儿上、宝儿水、义合村、五合村等地群众，都到这个合作社来购买东西，许多过去没有入股的群众都纷纷来入股了。这个合作社所以能得到群众的拥护，主要有三个原因：（一）能根据实际情况，组织群众生产，解除群众困难，帮助群众渡过了灾荒。（二）领导上充分的发扬了民主，由大家来研究如何进行营业。从去年十月以来，曾开过四次股东大会，并邀请没有入股的群众参加，听取他们的意见。每一季节应该进行什么业务，以及货物的价格，全是股东大会上讨论决定的。（三）及时分红，解除群众思想顾虑。去年十月到今年三月，群众到合作社赊盐赊布的很多，有的群众摸不清合作社是否会赚钱，对合作社发生了怀疑，要求退股，有的要求抽出股本来还帐。这时合作社及时的算了帐，发了红利，每一万元分得红利一万零五百元，群众的顾虑打破了，有的用红利还了帐，有的连本带利又入了股。群众都说这个合作社是“真正给人民办好事的合作社！”
    马安村的合作社是为了应付上级，硬凑了五百六十万元实物股金办起来的。除了卖些布、席、酒、烟等物外，别的营业什么也没有。今年算帐时一万元也赚了七千元，但合作社怕群众自由处理了红利，就下命令一律不许抽红利。春天群众非常困难，最需要钱，眼看着合作社里有钱抽不出来。合作社对于群众的生活问题并不关心，也不设法组织群众进行生产。该社共有四个免勤干部在里面工作，群众觉得他们干不了多少事，又不出勤务，赚了钱还按三股分，非常不满，许多群众要求抽股，解散这个合作社。
