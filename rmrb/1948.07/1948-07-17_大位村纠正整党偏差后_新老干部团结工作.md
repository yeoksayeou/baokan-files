　　Dawei Village Corrects Deviations in Party Rectification
    New and Veteran Cadres Unite for Work
    [Jizhong News] The CPC Shen County Committee, on the 19th of last month, circulated to the entire county the experience and process of the Dawei Village, Tenth District of the county, in rectifying the Party and resolving the relationship between new and veteran cadres, stating in essence: During the Party rectification, due to a lack of investigation and research, Party members were treated indiscriminately, and two cadres, Zheng Yuzeng and Qi Zhengzhong, who had engaged in minor corruption, confessed at mass meetings. Branch Secretary Zhang Laoyue, security officer Zhang Yiwang, and industrial committee member Zhu Ping, who were active and responsible in their work but had a coercive style, were mistakenly labeled as "stones" and had their Party membership suspended and were detained for over a month. Forty-six Party members and non-Party cadres were dismissed from their positions; two middle-peasant Party members were wrongly classified as rich peasants and had their Party membership suspended; fifteen poor-peasant Party members were wrongly classified as middle peasants and were not allowed to join the Poor Peasants' League. As a result, Party members and cadres were resentful, some fell ill, and others spoke out on behalf of those who had been confessed and detained. Veteran cadres generally felt demoralized, and a divide arose between new and veteran cadres, creating difficulties in the work. After discovering this situation, the leadership promptly took steps to resolve it.
    First, they corrected the wrongly determined class statuses. The Poor Peasants' League held a meeting to discuss this. Initially, poor peasant Qi Erbang mentioned that veteran cadre Zhu Ping was a poor man, and that Ren Laocun had been a beggar for two generations and should join the Poor Peasants' League. Many people disagreed. After the district cadre provided guidance, discussion was initiated, and Qi Xiaoniu said, "We cannot classify his entire family as middle peasants just because someone is critical of him; they are all poor people, and if we do that, everyone will feel embarrassed." Gradually, everyone's opinions became unified, and they exclaimed, "A mistake is a mistake, and what should be done should be done; don't change their class status." At the meeting, the class statuses were re-examined, and twenty-four poor peasant households were found among the middle peasants and were absorbed into the Poor Peasants' League, including fifteen veteran cadres.
    After the new branch was established, it immediately corrected the punishments of the Party members. Huai Yunfang and Gao Dajie, who had been classified as rich peasants from middle peasants, had their class statuses corrected and their Party membership restored. Zhang Laoyue and Zhu Ping, whose Party membership had been suspended pending investigation, had their punishment changed to a warning and dismissal, and Zhang Wanming's punishment was changed to a recommendation for dismissal. After the branch discussed and decided and the district committee approved, a mass meeting was convened. The branch secretary and committee members explained the importance of unity between new and veteran cadres and the reasons for promptly correcting their punishments. The district cadre made a profound self-criticism from the perspective of leadership, highlighted the achievements of the veteran cadres, and also pointed out their shortcomings, such as selfishness, commandism, and detachment from the masses, and explained the harm they caused to the Party and the people, and clarified the future of the Party members. Seeing that their contributions had not been erased and realizing their own shortcomings, the veteran cadres became calm. After these two meetings, the new cadres had a comprehensive understanding of the veteran cadres and saw their work achievements. When Zhang Wanming was transferred to another location, cadres and masses went to see him off. The relationship between new and veteran cadres, Party members, and the masses became closer.
    The branch meeting to discuss the admission of new Party members, attended by representatives of the new cadres, naturally formed a heart-to-heart meeting between new and veteran cadres or a meeting to review work style. Zhang Laoyue, the former branch secretary who had been detained for more than a month, said, "Moving my 'stone' was the opinion of a few people with prejudices, not the mass line." Veteran cadre Wang Kai and new cadre Qi Bei said in unison, "Your work style is not very good, but your intentions are not bad, but it is easy to cause dissatisfaction among the masses, and shortcomings in work style should not be there." Veteran cadre Qi Rong said, "Party members who are gold are gold, and those who are soil are soil, must be able to withstand scrutiny... The work style of the new cadres is better than that of the veteran cadres, fair and democratic, and not for their own benefit." At this time, the topic turned to the achievements of the Party rectification, and everyone agreed that the Party rectification was correct, otherwise the masses could not be mobilized. As far as the Party members themselves are concerned, if bad habits cannot be changed, they will become incurable if they develop. Veteran village chief Sun Cangxi said, "I used to be very timid, afraid of making mistakes, and I didn't work hard. Later, I saw that the work style of the new cadres was much stronger than that of the veteran cadres, and we discussed things together, and we understood each other before doing things. We didn't treat the old cadres as outsiders. If there was anything, we would consult with me and have a discussion at the meeting. Even if there was a small gap, it would be opened up. Now I am not so pessimistic and discouraged by the new cadres taking the lead." New cadre Liu Lanzhi said, "I feel that I have little experience and cannot bear the responsibility. If I have something to do, I will discuss it with Yunfang and Dajie, they have experience. New cadres are anxious and cannot find a clue, and veteran cadres should teach them more. Being together all day long, even small opinions will be resolved." Everyone spoke their minds, exchanged ideas, and the meeting was very happy. Gao Dajie said, "If this meeting had been held earlier, people would have been clearer in their minds." At the meeting, it was decided that new cadre activists Qi Bei and Liu Lanzhi would join the Party. They both had high prestige among the masses, which made the relationship between the Party and the masses and between new and veteran cadres closer. After the meeting, Zhang Laoyue and Zhu Ping, who had been detained, also took the initiative to work and actively provided opinions on preferential treatment for military families and militia management. Most of the good veteran cadres were restored to their positions through mass elections and with the consent of the masses, and production work was carried out smoothly.

### 大位村纠正整党偏差后　新老干部团结工作

　　大位村纠正整党偏差后
    新老干部团结工作
    【冀中讯】中共深县县委于上月十九日，将该县十区大位村整党与解决新老干部关系的经过与经验通报全县，大意称：整党时由于缺乏调查研究，对党员“北瓜茄子”（不分好坏）一齐数，两个有点小贪污的干部郑玉增、齐正中在群众会上坦白了。支部书记张老月、治安员张义旺、实业委员朱平工作积极负责，作风上强迫命令，也误当做“石头”停止了党籍，并扣押了一个多月。党员与非党干部四十六人被撤职；两个中农党员错划成富农，停止了党籍；十五个贫农党员错划成中农，没让加入贫农团。因此，党员与干部都发了＠，有的病了，有的替被坦白被扣押的抱不平。老干部一般是情绪低落，新老干部产生了隔膜，造成工作中的困难。领导上发现这种情况后，便抓紧解决。
    首先改正错订成份。贫农团先开会讨论。起初贫农齐二邦提到老干部朱平是穷人，任老存两辈要饭，应该参加贫农团。许多人不同意。后经区干部进行启发，引起讨论，齐小牛说：“咱不能因为人家挑皮，就把人家大人孩子都划成中农；都是穷人，这么办，大伙脸上都不好看。”大家意见逐渐统一起来，乱嚷道：“错是错，该怎么办怎么办，别给人家变了阶级”。会上重新审查了阶级，从中农里又找出了二十四家贫农，吸收参加了贫农团，其中有十五个是老干部。
    新支部建立后，即修正了党员的处分。由中农划为富农的怀运芳、高大捷，改正了成份，恢复了党籍。停止党籍听候审查的张老月、朱平改为警告撤职，张万明改为劝告撤职。支部讨论决定、区委批准后即召开群众大会，支书支委们说明了新老干部团结的重要与及时改正他们处分的道理，区干部从领导上作了深刻的检讨，提出了老干部的成绩，也提出了他们的缺点，如自私自利，强迫命令，脱离群众等给予党和人民的危害，并说明了党员的前途。老干部看见自己的功劳没有被抹煞，又认识到了自己的毛病，便心平气和了。在这两个会后，新干部对老干部有了全面的认识，看到了他们的工作成绩。在张万明外调时，干部和群众都去给他送行。新老干部、党员与群众的关系密切起来了。
    有新干部派代表参加的讨论新党员入党问题的支部会，很自然的形成了新老干部的谈心会或叫作风检讨会。曾被扣过一个多月的前支书张老月说：“搬我的石头，是几个有成见的人的意见，不是群众路线”。老干部王凯和新干部齐辈同声说：“你在作风上不大好，出心不差，可是容易惹的群众不满，作风上的缺点也不该有”。老干部齐荣说：“党员金就是金，土就是土，要经得住事……新干部作风比老干部好，公正民主，又不为己。”这时话题转到整党的成绩，一致认为整党是对的，不然发动不起群众来，就党员本身来讲，如果坏作风改不了，发展下去，就不可救药了。老村长孙藏玺说：“以前我可胆小了，光怕有了错，工作不上劲。后来看见新干部比老干部作风强多了，有事大伙商量，心通意通了再去做，对旧干部不当外人，有什么事找我商量，在会上扯扯思想，就是有点小隔子，可也就开了，现在叫新干部挂拉的我不那么悲观泄劲了”。新干部刘兰芝说：“我自觉着材料小，负不起责任来，有事就和运芳、大捷他们商量商量，他们有经验。新干部着急，摸不着头，老干部就得多教教。一天价在一块，有点小意见也就磨化了”。大家你一言，我一语，都说了自己心里的话，还互相交换了意见，会开的很高兴。高大捷说：“这个会要早开些日子，人们心里更亮快了”。会上通过新干部积极分子齐辈、刘兰芝参加了党，他们在群众中都很有威信，使党与群众、新老干部的关系更加密切了。会后，被扣过的张老月、朱平也主动的做工作，积极的提供优军和民兵管理上的意见。好的老干部大部分在群众选举和群众同意下恢复了工作，生产工作顺利的开展起来。
