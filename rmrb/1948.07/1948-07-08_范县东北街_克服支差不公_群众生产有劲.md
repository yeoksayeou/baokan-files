From the JiluYu News:

　　Northeast Street in Fan County has a total of 106 households. Only 18 people are assigned to stretcher-bearer duties, and the total number assigned to support the front is less than 40. Many people are not participating in labor drafts. Among the village cadres, nine are exempt from labor drafts, and those related to the village cadres are also exempt. Some who participate in cooperatives, stores, or theatrical troupes also avoid labor drafts. Honest people suffer greatly and are very dissatisfied, causing resentment every time there is a labor draft. On June 3rd, the work team led a cadre meeting, explaining the new regulations for labor drafts. Village cadres made self-criticisms regarding the past unreasonable labor draft practices. The meeting discussed future labor draft methods, followed by a mass meeting to encourage everyone to discuss and offer opinions. Then, all those of age to participate in labor drafts were registered, and the list was posted for the masses to examine. The registration results showed that there were 76 young and middle-aged people aged 18 to 50. Except for four village cadres who were too busy, nine militiamen (militiamen should also participate in labor drafts; too many village cadres are exempt – editor's note), three disabled or seriously ill people, and six military dependents who are exempt from long-term labor drafts, the remaining 54 people are able to participate in long-term labor drafts, which is twice as many as before. Ten people, including the elderly and young, and six military dependents are assigned to short-term labor drafts. The masses are satisfied, and their enthusiasm for production has increased. Li Guangxing, who had consistently been assigned to more labor drafts in the past, reflected, "This way, I can free up some time to work."

　　范县东北街
    克服支差不公群众生产有劲
    【冀鲁豫讯】范县东北街共一百零六户，出担架差的只十八个人，连支后方差的总起来还不到四十人，许多人都不出工。村干中有九个不支差，和村干部有关的人也不支差，有些参加合作社、商店、剧团的也都躲着不支差；老实人吃很大亏，非常不满，每到出差就闹气。六月初三，工作组领导着开了一个干部会，解释了新的支差规定，村干部对过去不合理的支差现象作了检讨。会上讨论了今后的支差办法，接着又召开群众会，发动大家讨论，提意见，然后将够出差年龄的全部登记，贴出榜去，让群众审察。登记结果，十八至五十岁的青壮年共七十六名，除四个太忙的村干、九个民兵（民兵也应该支差，个村干不支差也太多四——编者），三个残废有重病的不支差，六个军属不出长差外，其余能出长差的有五十四名，比过去增加了两倍。出短差的有老少班十名，军属六名。群众满意了，生产情绪高起来。过去一贯多支差的李广兴反映：“这样我就能誊出点空做活了”。
