　　Government Loans Actively Support
    Yuncheng Lu Salt Achieves Development
    [Taiyue News] The Yuncheng Lu Salt Administration in Southern Shanxi is actively supporting the salt industry, implementing the principles of private production, private transportation, private sales, public assistance, mutual benefit for labor and capital, and consideration of both public and private interests. The salt industry has begun to see new development. Salt pond merchants such as Zhang Dunjing and Wu Xiufang, who had fled, have successively returned to resume their businesses. After the liberation of the salt ponds, the democratic government announced the above principles. The Lu Salt Administration compensated salt merchants for losses incurred due to public affairs, initially issuing 90 million yuan (Jicha currency, same below). Subsequently, it organized the restoration of the salt industry. On June 21st, it convened a meeting of all manufacturers, establishing the Hedong Lu Salt Manufacturing Plant Joint Association, democratically electing Wang Mingxian and four others as members, enabling manufacturers to develop production in an organized and planned manner. The democratic government simultaneously issued substantial loans to support manufacturers. Before June, 800 million yuan had been loaned, and in June, an additional 80 million yuan was loaned. In terms of organizing private transportation and sales, it formally announced the abolition of the monopolistic control methods of exclusive sales under the enemy, puppet, and Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan rule in the past, implementing a one-time tax collection at the site. Except for goods transported to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, which are subject to a 5% export tax, free transportation and sales are allowed in the liberated areas without further taxation. The Lu Salt Administration also organized transport and sales merchants in Yuncheng, Anyi, and Dongguo Town. Twelve were organized in Yuncheng, each receiving a loan of 5 million yuan. Currently, 19 firms, including Xiejii and Taiji, have begun transportation and sales. Three firms, including Yumin, were organized in Anyi, each receiving a loan of 1 million yuan, and another three firms were given 180,000 jin of salt to sell and repay the money. In June, the salt industry began to develop, producing 600-700 ming (equivalent to 2.5-2.6 million jin) of salt. This year's plan is to produce 2,000 ming of salt. If the plan is fully realized, the output will exceed three times the output during the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit rule. Some salt merchants who had closed down, or who had been deceived by Kuomintang propaganda and fled to Xi'an, have successively returned to resume their businesses. Ten people, including Zhang Dunjing and Wu Xiufang, have returned from Xi'an, and eight people, including Sun Zhongxian, have returned from their homes. According to salt merchants, many more are preparing to return. They said: "This time we returned because the democratic government announced the principles of private operation, public assistance, and mutual benefit for labor and capital, and provided substantial loans to support manufacturers and develop the salt industry, so we returned." Some who had been closed for a long time also rushed to resume business after hearing about the democratic government's loans and support. Chen Jianzhong, the owner of the Yao Chengqiu Salt Plant, who is already seventy years old, rushed to the Lu Salt Administration on June 17th with crutches to discuss reopening the factory. He said: "My salt plant closed down because during the internal war between Yan Xishan and Chiang Kai-shek in 1929, the capital was suppressed, and the salt was ruined by rain. Today, I know that the democratic government supports the salt industry, provides loans, and can achieve production and sales without suppressing capital, and the future is promising, so I want to resume business." He said with great confidence: "I must work hard in the future."

　　政府贷款积极扶植
    运城潞盐获得发展
    【太岳讯】晋南运城潞盐管理局积极扶植盐业，实行民产、民运、民销、公助、劳资两利、公私兼顾的方针，盐业开始得到新的发展。逃亡在外的盐池厂商张敦敬、武秀芳等陆续返回复业。盐池解放后，民主政府则宣布了以上各种方针，潞盐管理局对盐商因公所受损失作了赔偿，先发了九千万（冀钞，下同）元，接着组织恢复盐业；在六月二十一日召开全体厂商会议，成立河东潞盐制造厂联合会，民主选出王明贤等五人为委员，使厂商得以有组织有计划的发展生产。民主政府同时发出大量贷款扶植厂商；六月份以前贷出八万万元，六月份又贷出八千余万元。在组织民运民销方面，正式宣布废除过去敌伪及蒋阎统治时期包销专卖的统制办法，实行就场征税一次的办法，除运往蒋管区者须征收百分之五的出口税外，在解放区可以自由运销，再不征税。潞盐管理局又分别到运城、安邑、东郭镇组织运销商，运城组织了十二家，各贷款五百万元。现协记、泰记等十九家已开始运销。安邑组织了裕民等三家，各贷款一百万元，又给其他三家贷了十八万斤盐，卖完还钱。六月份盐业开始得到发展，出盐六、七百铭（合两千五、六百万斤），今年计划产盐两千铭。如果计划全部实现，当超过蒋阎匪统治时产量的三倍。有些已停业的盐商，或被国民党欺骗宣传跑到西安的盐商，陆续赶回，纷纷复业。从西安回来的有张敦敬、武秀芳等十人，从家里出来的有孙仲贤等八人。据盐商谈，还有不少人正准备回来。他们说：这次回来，因为民主政府宣布了民办、公助、劳资两利的方针，又大量贷　扶植厂商，发展盐业，所以我们就回来了。有些已停业很久的，也因听到民主政府贷款扶植，赶紧出来复业。姚成邱盐厂的东家陈建忠已七十岁了，六月十七日拄着拐杖赶到潞盐管理局，接洽重新开厂。他说：“我的盐厂是因为民国十八年阎锡山与蒋介石打内战，资本被压住，盐叫雨化了，就倒闭了。今天知道民主政府扶植盐业，发放贷款，能做到随产随销，不压资本，前途有利，所以要复业。”他很有信心的说：“以后可要好好干了。”
