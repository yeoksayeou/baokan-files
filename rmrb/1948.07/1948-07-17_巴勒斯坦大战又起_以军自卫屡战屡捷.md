Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Reports from various sources: When the four-week "truce" in Palestine expired on July 9th, and Count Bernadotte's "federal" plan to abolish Israeli independence was rejected, the Arab invading armies launched another full-scale attack on the State of Israel. Since the 5th, the war has been raging across Palestine, including Jerusalem and Lydda in the center, Beersheba in the south, Galilee in the north, and the coastal Haifa-Tel Aviv highway in the northwest. The heroic Israeli army, acting in self-defense, is in a superior position, and has achieved several major victories in the main battlefield—the center. On the 10th, the Israeli army recaptured the important airport of Lydda (southeast of Tel Aviv) and Wilhelma, which were occupied by the Arab army in the early stages of the war. On the 12th, the Israeli army also occupied Ramle, a key location southwest of Lydda Sea, and its northeastern twin cities, thereby opening a road to the southeast towards Latrun. (Note: Latrun is the center of the Arab blockade of the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway.) Not only that, but the Israeli government issued a public statement on the 11th stating that the Israeli army had entered the territory of Transjordan and launched an encirclement of Mishmar HaYarden, occupied by Arab forces.

　　巴勒斯坦大战又起
    以军自卫屡战屡捷
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方报导：当巴勒斯坦“停战”四周于七月九日宣告期满，而伯纳杜特取消以色列独立的“联邦”计划遭到拒绝之际，阿剌伯侵略军已再次发动对以色列国的全面进攻。自五日迄今，战争已在巴勒斯坦全境包括中部之耶路撒冷、里达，南部之比尔希巴，北部之加里利，西北部沿海之海法至特拉维夫公路一带激烈展开。英勇自卫的以色列军居于优势，它已在主要战场——中部——取得若干重大胜利。十日，以色列军夺回了战争初期即为阿剌伯军所侵占的重要机场里达（特拉维夫东南）及维尔赫尔姆两地；十二日，以色列军又占领里达海西南的要地蓝姆勒及其东北的双子城，从而打开一条向东南进击拉特之隆道路（按：拉特隆为阿剌伯人封锁耶路撒冷至特拉维夫公路之中心）。不仅如此，以色列政府且于十一日发表公报称：以军已进入外约旦国境，并对阿剌伯军队占领下的米施马哈雅敦展开包围战。
