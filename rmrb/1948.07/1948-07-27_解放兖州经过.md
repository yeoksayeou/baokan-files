Xinhua News Agency, Jinpu Front, 21st: A front-line reporter reported the liberation of Yanzhou, stating: The People's Liberation Army completely surrounded Yanzhou City on the night of the 20th of last month. The defending Chiang Kai-shek troops, including the 111th Brigade of the 12th Division of the 12th Army, a regiment of the 112th Brigade, the Independent Brigade, and the 3rd Brigade of the Shandong Provincial Security Force, stubbornly resisted, holding onto outposts like Liulichang outside the city, under the command of Li Yutang, Lieutenant General Commander of the 10th Pacification Zone of Chiang Kai-shek, and Huo Shouyi, Lieutenant General Commander of the 12th Army. Considering that the 12th Division was originally a Northeast Army unit, the People's Liberation Army was reluctant to see them sacrifice their lives for Chiang Kai-shek and repeatedly explained the righteousness to them, urging them to recognize the general trend and turn to the people's side. Unexpectedly, the enemy Huo Shouyi stubbornly refused to come to his senses. The People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the night of the 24th, first occupying Liulichang in the northeast of the city that night. On the 25th, they captured Xiguan. The defending enemy even fired poison gas shells at this time. Fortunately, we were well prepared and suffered no damage. On the 1st of this month, our army continued to capture Zhao Village outside Xiguan. On the 3rd, they captured Doufu (tofu) shop and the outposts of Qianyao and Houyao outside Nanguan. On the 4th, they captured the old pass in the northwest of the city. Under the coercion of the "督战队 (督战队: Dūzhàn duì, literally "supervising battle team", referring to units assigned to ensure troops followed orders during combat, often associated with strict discipline and potential punishment for retreat or failure)" , the defending enemy launched desperate counterattacks against the outposts we occupied, but were all defeated by us. By the 8th, all the important outposts around Yanzhou had fallen into our hands. At 8 p.m. on the 12th, our army launched a fierce attack on the city. Under the cover of powerful and accurate artillery fire, the infantry first crossed several rows of chevaux-de-frise, barbed wire, and outer moats on the western wall, bravely climbed the city walls, and eliminated all enemy resistance. Immediately afterwards, they crossed the inner moat and entered fierce fighting. Other sections of the city walls were also successively breached by us at the same time. Our attacking troops quickly joined forces, smashing the enemy into pieces, and a large part of them were annihilated by us; a part that fled to the vicinity of the southeast of the city was also completely annihilated by us. The battle ended victoriously at dusk on the 13th, only a day and night after the start of the city attack. At this point, the Yanzhou city, which the defeated general Liu Zhi boasted as "absolutely no problem," was captured.

　　解放兖州经过
    【新华社津浦前线二十一日电】前线记者报导解放兖州经过称：解放军于上月二十日夜一举包围兖州城，守城蒋军整十二军整十二师之一一一旅、一一二旅一个团、独立旅及山东省保安第三旅等部，在蒋第十绥区中将司令官李玉堂及整十二军中将军长霍守义指挥下，据守城关外围之琉璃厂等据点负隅顽抗。解放军以十二师系原东北军部队，不忍其为蒋介石送命，曾一再晓以大义，促其认清大势，转向人民方面来。讵料该敌霍守义竟执迷不悟。解放军遂于二十四日夜发起攻击，当夜首先占领城东北的琉璃厂，二十五日攻占西关，守敌竟于此时发射毒气炮弹，幸我准备严密，未受损害。本月一日我军即继攻占西关外之赵家村，三日又攻占豆腐店及南关外之前窑、后窑等据点，四日攻占城西北之旧关。守敌在“督战队”胁迫下，虽曾向我所占各据点作绝望的反扑，但均被我击溃。迄八日止，兖州外围各重要据点均落我手。十二日晚八时，我军发动对城中之猛烈攻击，步兵在强大与准确的炮火掩护下，首先在西垣越过数道鹿砦、铁丝网、外壕，奋勇登城，排除敌人一切抵抗。紧接着又越过内壕，进入激战。其他各面城垣亦同时相继为我突破。我各路攻城部队迅速会师，将敌人打得七零八落，狼奔豕突，大部被我聚歼；其窜至城东南附近之一部，亦被我全部追歼。十三日黄昏，战事胜利结束，距攻城开始时仅历一昼夜。至此，败将刘峙所夸称“决无问题”的兖州城乃告攻克。
