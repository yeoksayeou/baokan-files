Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 8th: The Northeast Daily published an editorial on the 27th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party on July 1st, entitled "Unified Will, Unified Action, Unified Discipline," stating: The recent instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on strengthening the unified will, unified action, and unified discipline of the entire party to strive for national victory are extremely timely and important for the Northeast Liberated Area. Today, East, West, South, and North Manchuria have been united into one, and are also united with Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning. We have 42 million people, control 230 cities, more than 8,000 miles of railways, and many modern light and heavy industries and mines. The enemy is divided and blockaded, with only 34 enemy-occupied cities remaining in the Northeast and Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning area. The combat methods of our army have also developed from relatively small-scale mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare to large-scale siege warfare and mobile warfare. At the same time, land reform has been basically completed in eight or nine tenths of the Northeast Liberated Area. The reactionary rule of landlords, rich peasants, and feudal forces has been overthrown, and their reactionary armed forces and various bandit groups within our basic areas have been eliminated. Various constructions in the Liberated Area have a preliminary foundation. Under this situation, the basic task of the entire Northeast in the future is to further organize all manpower and material resources into a unified force, vigorously develop agricultural and industrial production, increase our material strength, improve the lives of the people in the Liberated Area, and meet all the needs of large-scale troop concentration operations on the front lines. In the past, the various necessary decentralization and permission of more local autonomy to each unit that we had to implement. If we still stick to the old ways and remain unchanged, it will become something that hinders the development of the situation, weakening our own strength and benefiting the enemy.

The editorial pointed out: The Northeast Party, even in the past, was basically centralized and unified. Without this basic condition, it would not have been possible to have today's favorable situation in the Northeast. However, even in the past, there were still many places in the Northeast Party where centralization was lacking where it should have been, and unification was lacking where it should have been. This situation is particularly serious at present. In order to strengthen unified centralization in the future, the first requirement is that the entire party implement strict unification in various policies and strategies. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the centralized unification of organizations and systems. Thirdly, it is necessary to strengthen the concept of law-abiding. The editorial reviewed the various shortcomings that existed in the Northeast in the past based on these three aspects, pointing out that these states of non-centralization and non-unification caused extremely great damage to the interests of the revolution. The editorial proposed: At present, it is necessary to conduct extensive and profound education throughout the Party and the army in the Northeast. Every comrade should carefully and seriously study and learn based on the Central Committee's reprinting of Chapter 2 of "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" and the Propaganda Department's "Preface," based on Chairman Mao's and the Central Committee's instructions on this aspect, and in connection with examining their own thinking and work style, resolutely struggle against localism, departmentalism, empiricism, and guerrillaism that hinder unification and centralization, and resolutely struggle against all disorganization, indiscipline, and anarchy.

The editorial also pointed out: Unifying thinking is still our main method for transforming the old ideas, old work styles, and old habits in many comrades. However, it is not enough to rely solely on the method of unifying thinking. We must also use the Party's discipline and the government's laws to guarantee the unity of will and unity of action of the entire Party and the entire army. Enforcing discipline and law is essentially a kind of education. Today, we must first cultivate a strict discipline and a spirit of public service and law-abiding within the Party. Without this, we will not be able to lead the people's revolution to final victory.

### 统一意志，统一行动，统一纪律。

专栏：东北日报七一社论

　　统一意志，统一行动，统一纪律。
    【新华社东北八日电】东北日报于“七一”中共诞生二十七周年纪念，以“统一意志，统一行动，统一纪律”为题，发表社论称：中共中央最近关于加强全党统一意志，统一行动与统一纪律以争取全国胜利的指示，对东北解放区来说，极为及时，极为重要。今天，东西南北满已经联成一片，与冀察热辽也已联成一片。拥有四千二百万人口，掌握二百三十座城市，八千多里铁路与许多近代化的轻重工业和矿山。而敌人则被分割被封锁，东北与冀察热辽敌占城市仅剩三十四座。我军的作战方法亦由比较小规模的运动战、游击战发展到大规模的攻坚战、运动战。同时东北解放区十分之八九的地区土地改革已经基本完成，地主富农封建势力的反动统治已被打倒，他们在我基本地区内的反动武装，各色各样的土匪队伍已经肃清。解放区的各种建设已经有了初步的基础。在这一形势下，今后全东北的基本任务，就是把一切人力物力进一步组织为统一的力量，努力发展农业生产与工业生产，增加我们的物质力量，改善解放区人民的生活，与满足前线大兵团集中作战的一切需要。过去我们曾不能不实行的各种必要的分散，和允许各单位更多的地方自治权。现在如果仍然墨守成规，一成不变，就会变成阻碍形势发展的东西，以致削弱我们自己力量，有利于敌人。
    社论指出：东北的党即使在过去基本上也是集中的与统一的，没有这个基本条件，就不可能出现有今天东北的有利局面。但东北党即使在过去，应集中而不集中，应统一而未统一的地方也还很多。这种情形到目前就尤其感到严重。今后为加强统一集中，首先就要求全党在各种政策与策略上实行严格的统一。其次要加强组织与制度的集中统一。再其次是加强守法观念。社论根据这三方面检讨了过去东北所存在的各种缺点，指出这些不集中不统一的状态，给予革命利益的损害极为巨大。社论提出：目前需要在东北全党全军进行广泛深刻的教育。每个同志都应根据中央重印“左派幼稚病”第二章和中宣部的“前言”，根据毛主席和中央关于这方面的指示文件，认真严肃地加以研究学习，并联系检查自己的思想作风，坚决与那些妨碍统一与集中的地方主义、本位主义、经验主义、游击主义等作斗争，并坚决与一切无组织、无纪律、无政府状态作斗争。
    社论又指出：打通思想，这仍然是我们转变许多同志中的旧思想、旧作风、旧习惯的主要方法。但仅仅靠打通思想的办法，是不够的。我们还必须以党的纪律与政府的法律，来保证全党全军意志的统一和行动的统一。执行纪律与法律实质上就是一种教育。今天我们必须首先要在党内养成纪律严明的风气，奉公守法的精神。没有这，我们就无法领导人民革命达到最后胜利。
