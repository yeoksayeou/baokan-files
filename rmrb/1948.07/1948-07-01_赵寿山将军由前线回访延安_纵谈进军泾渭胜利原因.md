　　General Zhao Shoushan, Deputy Commander of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, recently returned to the front lines after his first visit to Yan'an since taking office. General Zhao expressed his admiration for the spirit of the people of Yan'an, who are actively rebuilding the new Yan'an while fighting against the famine and enthusiastically supporting the front. He pointed out that the liberation of Yan'an is closely related to the large-scale advance of our army into the Jing and Wei River basin. Regarding this Jing and Wei River operation, General Zhao, after describing our army's victory in annihilating nearly 20,000 enemies and capturing 14 cities, particularly emphasized the following two points: First, our army was completely proactive and planned the enemy's movements. For example, a part of our army besieged Yan'an and Luochuan, attracting the enemy's Pei Changhui Corps to reinforce from western Henan and southeastern Shaanxi, crowding them at the southern end of the Xian-Yu Highway. When we crossed the Jing River in large strides and swept the north bank of the Wei River, the Pei enemy hurriedly moved westward. The enemy's deployment was completely disrupted, while we not only completed the expected tasks of the Jing and Wei River operation, but also liberated Yan'an and Luochuan, consolidating the Guanzhong and Huanglong districts in the southern part of the border region. General Zhao said with a smile: "Hu Zongnan's army also has to listen to Deputy Commander Peng's orders." The other point is the people of Greater Guanzhong's loyalty, support, and love for our army. After listing many moving examples, General Zhao said: "Chairman Mao told us: 'The direction of the people's hearts is the decisive factor that constantly plays a role in victory.' This is truly a profound truth. This Jing and Wei River operation and the visit to Yan'an to observe the people's reconstruction have made us deeply realize the greatness of the people's power."

　　赵寿山将军由前线回访延安
    纵谈进军泾渭胜利原因
    【新华社西北二十九日电】西北人民解放军副司令员赵寿山将军前由战地赴延安作任职以来的首次访问，已于最近返抵前线。赵将军对延安人民一面与灾荒斗争一面热烈支前的情况下，积极重建新延安的精神，极表敬佩。他指出延安的光复与我军向泾渭流域的大进军是密切关联的。关于这次泾渭作战，赵将军于叙述了我军歼敌近两万，克城十四座的胜利战果后，特别强调以下两点：其一是我军完全主动，有计划地调动了敌人。如我军一部围攻延安洛川，吸引了敌裴昌会兵团由豫西和陕东南向北增援，拥挤到咸榆公路南端；当我大踏步渡过泾河席卷渭河北岸时，裴敌又匆忙向西。敌人的部署完全被打乱，而我则不但完成了泾渭作战的预期任务，而且光复了延安和洛川，巩固了边区南部的关中及黄龙分区。赵将军笑着说：“胡宗南军队也要听彭副总司令的调动的”。另一点是大关中人民对我军的忠诚拥护爱戴。赵将军在列举了许多动人的事例以后说：“毛主席告诉我们：‘人心的向背才是决定胜利经常地起作用的因素’，这真是至理。这次泾渭作战及到延安参观人民的恢复建设，都使我们深深体会到人民力量的伟大。”
