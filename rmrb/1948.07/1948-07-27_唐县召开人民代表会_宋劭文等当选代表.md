Chahar Telegram: Tang County convened a county-wide People's Representative Conference on the 17th of this month to elect representatives to the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference. A total of thirty representatives attended: fifteen representatives from various districts, ten representatives from county-level party, government, and people's organizations, one doctor representative, one student representative, one teacher representative, and two shop employee and merchant representatives. Zhao Lorang, a respected local figure hired by the government, also attended. The election was conducted using a secret, multiple-name ballot. Zhao Lorang and two others were publicly selected as ballot supervisors. The election results: Comrade Chen Ze San, a representative of the Communist Party in Tang County, was elected as a regional representative with twenty-seven votes; Song Shaowen, the former Director of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee, was elected as a representative of senior revolutionary cadres with twenty-nine votes; Yan Yiqing, a respected local figure from Tang County (currently working in the Border Region Government's Agriculture and Forestry Department), was also elected as a representative with twenty-seven votes. Attendees presented many proposals to the elected representatives, hoping they would bring them to the North China People's Representative Conference. Summarized, these include the following: 1. The government should vigorously support production. Now that many poor and hired peasants have been allocated land, they cannot produce well because they lack floating capital to buy tools. Technical improvements are also needed, such as eliminating pests and diseases. In particular, organizing labor is even more important, and the government should provide strong leadership. 2. Support-the-frontline services should be vigorously reorganized, organizational leadership strengthened, and civilian labor conserved. Formal regulations should be established for the care of families of militiamen on long expeditions. Grain tax burdens should be promptly promulgated, made fair and reasonable, to encourage production and stabilize production morale. 3. The Communist Party has achieved brilliant results in leading the masses in the People's Revolutionary War and land reform. After party rectification, the relationship between the Party and the people has become even closer, and the Party's popularization has been further enhanced. It is hoped that the Communist Party will continue to implement the spirit of party rectification and transform certain branch members to make the Party more pure and strong. 4. A unified village government organization should be established quickly, a democratic style cultivated, democratic education strengthened, and extreme democratic phenomena overcome. 5. Orphans, widows, and households without labor cannot engage in production and face the greatest difficulties in life, and a solution should be found.

　　唐县召开人民代表会
  　宋劭文等当选代表
    【察哈尔电】唐县于本月十七日召开全县人民代表大会，选举华北临时人民代表大会的代表。共到会代表三十人：计各区代表十五人，县级党政民各机关职员代表十人，医生代表一人，学生代表一人，教师代表一人，商店职员和商人代表二人，政府聘请的社会贤达赵洛让也出席参加。选举采取无记名连记法进行。公推赵洛让等三人监票。选举结果：唐县共产党代表陈泽三同志以二十七票当选为区域代表；原晋察冀边区行政委员会主任宋劭文以二十九票当选为高级革命职员代表；唐县社会贤达阎翼清（现在边府农林处工作）亦以二十七票当选为代表。到会者向当选代表提出许多提案，希望他们带到华北人民代表大会上去。归纳起来，有以下数项：一、政府应用大力扶植生产。现在不少贫雇农分地后，因浮财少，买不上工具，不能很好的生产；在技术上也需要提高，如消除病虫害等；特别是组织劳力更为重要，政府应以大力领导。二、支前勤务应用大力整顿，加强组织领导，节省民力。对远征民兵家属的照顾，应有正式规定。公粮负担应迅速颁布办法，作到公平合理，以奖励生产，稳定生产情绪。三、共产党领导群众进行人民革命战争和土地改革，获得光辉成绩。整党后党和人民的关系，更密切了，党的群众化更提高了一步，希望共产党继续贯彻整党精神，改造某些支部党员，使党内更加纯洁坚强。四、应迅速建立统一的村政权组织，树立民主作风，加强民主教育，克服极端民主现象。五、孤寡无劳力户不能进行生产，生活最困难，应设法解决。
