[JiluYu Telegram] Since the afternoon of the 18th, the area north of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region has experienced rainfall, which cleared up on the 21st. Most areas of the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 9th districts have been thoroughly soaked. Although some areas have not been completely soaked, they are wet to a depth of one plow, allowing for planting. All localities are actively carrying out crash planting after the rain. In Fanxian and Yanggu counties, after the rain fell, a mobilization was carried out during the ongoing conference for electing representatives to the North China People's Congress, requiring the representatives to return and participate in and lead the crash planting effort. The county committee also called on all cadres to go deep into the villages, patiently understand and help the masses solve difficulties such as livestock, farm tools, and seeds. In Puyang County, after the heavy rain, the entire county immediately shifted from spot planting and watering seedlings to crash planting. As soon as the rain stopped, the county committee convened a meeting of cadres from all county-level agencies, mobilizing them to lead and organize the masses to crash plant. It was stipulated that: (1) All county-level agencies, except for a few cadres who remain to maintain work, should be assigned to villages to lead the masses in crash planting; (2) For families of military personnel and martyrs who lack labor, the masses should be mobilized to help them plant together, ensuring that not an acre of land is left uncultivated. On the same afternoon, the cadres of the county agencies went to various districts. On the second day after the rain began (the 19th), the Guancheng County Committee instructed all districts to concentrate all efforts on crash planting. In areas where labor is scarce, people should be organized to pull seed drills, and all semi-laborers, women, children, the elderly, and the weak should be mobilized to plant sweet potatoes and corn, ensuring that no one is idle and striving to complete all planting within three to five days. In the few villages where it did not rain or where the rain was light, and where seed drills cannot be used, the masses should continue to be organized to spot plant, overcoming the phenomenon of waiting and doing nothing until it rains. The village cadre and party member training class (more than 200 people), originally scheduled to begin gathering on the afternoon of the 19th, decided to postpone the start of classes for three days, so that they could lead the masses in taking advantage of the post-rain period for crash planting.

　　冀鲁豫河北地区透雨
  　干部大力领导抢种
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫黄河以北地区自十八日下午开始降雨，迄二十一日始晴。四、六、八、九分区均大部地区下透了，小部地区虽未下透，也有一犁深，可以下种。各地都在积极进行雨后抢种。范（县）阳（谷）两县落雨后，在正开着的选举华北人民代表的会议上作了动员，要求代表们回去即参加与领导突击抢种。县委会并号召所有干部深入到村，耐心了解和帮助群众解决牲口、耕具、种籽等困难。濮县下了透雨，全县即从点种浇苗工作转为抢种。刚住了雨，县委会即召开县一级各机关干部大会，动员领导与组织群众抢种，并规定：（１）县一级机关除留几个干部坚持工作外，一律分到村去领导群众抢种；（２）对无劳力的军工烈属发动群众帮助他们一块种，保证不荒一亩地。当日下午县机关干部即分头到各区去。观城县委会在开始下雨的第二天（十九日），就指示各区，集中全力进行抢种。在劳力缺乏的地方应组织人拉耧，动员一切半劳力，妇女儿童老弱都下手栽红薯、点棒子，作到不闲一人，争取三五天内全部完成抢种。少部分没下雨或雨小的村庄，不能耧地的，则继续组织群众点种，克服等雨不下手的现象。原计划十九日下午开始集合的村干党员训练班（二百余人）决定延期三天开课，使他们能够领导群众，乘雨后突击抢种。
