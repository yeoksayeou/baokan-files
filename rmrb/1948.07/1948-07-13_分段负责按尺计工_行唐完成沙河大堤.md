　　Segmented Responsibility, Piecework by the Foot
    Xingtang Completes the Shahe River Embankment

    [This newspaper’s report] Xingtang repaired the Shahe River embankment, adopting a method of segmented responsibility and piecework by the foot, which was simple, fair, and improved work efficiency. Villages such as Bei@@ completed the embankment ahead of schedule and won a prize banner. Along the Shahe River in the county, from Hecun Village to Beigaolei, there was an original embankment fifteen li long, protecting fifteen villages and more than 15,300 mu of cultivated land. The lower section of this embankment was very low, and it was in danger of breaching whenever there was a major flood. In order to prevent floods and prepare for disasters, the county leadership sent a special person to be responsible for leading the construction, and each village established a river embankment committee to divide the work and responsibilities. The plan was to use 71,445 cubic feet of earth to raise the embankment by one or two feet to four or five feet. Construction officially began on May 11th. On the 13th, county and district cadres went to the county for a meeting, and the project automatically stopped. On the 24th, comrades Cui Shixian and Jia Lanhua from the county's Industry and Commerce Bureau conducted an investigation into the reason for the work stoppage. The masses said, "It's not that we don't want to repair it, it's that the method is unfair and we can't afford to waste time." "This embankment is repaired every year, but the superiors don't pay attention, and the slick people don't do a good job, which affects the good people who are also unwilling to do it." "Five people can't do the work of one person, a lot of effort is wasted, and the results are not great." "This is a wasteful canal." Comrades Cui and Jia discussed a proper solution with the embankment committee and decided to adopt the experience of Dong@@@@@@, stipulating the amount of soil each person should carry per day, assigning responsibility by segment according to the amount of labor in each village, and paying by the foot. First, it was divided to the village, and then from the village to the individual. It was stipulated that work would begin on May 25th and be completed by June 3rd. Whoever completed the plan first could stop working. The embankment committee also made a prize banner to award to the model village recognized by everyone. Everyone unanimously agreed with this fair method, and work efficiency quickly improved. The three villages of Bei@@, Dong, and Xi@@ completed the task two days ahead of schedule, and the four villages of Beigaolei, Jia Village, Huantong, and Nan@@ also completed it one day ahead of schedule. In the entire embankment repair process, many model figures emerged. For example, Wei Laoyuan and Jiang Jinyu of Jia Village carried 615 cubic feet of earth in one day. The old men Fan Luotao and Fan Luoyu in Bei@@, who were more than sixty years old, also carried an average of 110 cubic feet per day. Party member Jin Fu not only completed his own task but also helped others carry. Sun Qinghai, the industrial committee member and river embankment committee member of Bei@@, personally led the work and persevered to the end. Although he delayed a lot of work, he did not complain. The village was assigned 11,532 cubic feet of soil according to labor, and not only completed it ahead of schedule, but also exceeded the original plan. In the final assessment, each village recognized Bei@@ as a model village for embankment repair and won a red prize banner.

　　分段负责按尺计工
    行唐完成沙河大堤
    【本报讯】行唐补修沙河大堤，采取分段负责按尺计工的办法，简易公平，提高了工作效率。北＠＠等村在修堤中提前完工，荣获奖旗。该县沙河沿岸由河合村至北高垒，原有十五里长的大堤一道，保护着十五个村庄及一万五千三百余亩耕地。该堤下段很低，一遇较大洪汛，即有决口的危险。该县领导为了防洪备灾，特派专人负责领导修筑，各村成立了河堤委员会，分工负责。计划以七万一千四百四十五立方尺土，将该堤埂加高一、二尺到四、五尺。五月十一日正式动工。十三日县区干部到县里开会，工程便自动停止了。二十四日县实业科派崔士贤、贾兰虎二同志考查停工原因，群众说：“不是不愿修，是办法不公平，误不起工。”“这堤每年补修，上级不注意，滑头人不好好干，影响好人也不愿干了。”“五个人干不了一个人的活，工夫耗的不少，成绩不大。”“这是道耗工渠”。崔、贾二同志和堤委会研究了妥善的办法，决定采用东＠＠＠＠的经验，规定每人每天抬土数量，按各村劳力多少，分段负责，按尺计工。先分到村，再由村分配到个人。规定五月二十五日开工，六月三日一律完工。谁先完成计划即可歇工。堤委会并作奖旗一面，奖给大家所公认的模范村。大家一致同意这个公平的办法，工作效率很快提高起来，北＠＠、东、西＠＠三村提前两天完成任务，北高垒、贾庄、欢同、南＠＠四村也提前完成一天。在整个修堤过程中，涌现了不少模范人物。如贾庄魏老远、蒋金玉二人，一天抬土六百十五立方尺，北＠＠六十多岁的老汉范洛涛、范洛雨每天平均也抬一百一十立方尺，党员金福除完成自己任务外，还帮助别人抬。北＠＠实业委员兼河堤委员孙清海亲自领工，坚持到底，虽耽误了不少工夫，但没一句怨言。该村按劳力分配一万一千五百三十二立方尺土，不仅提前完成，而且还超过原来计划，最后评工，各村公认北＠＠为修堤模范村，荣获红色奖旗一面。
