[Jizhong Telegram] A red and white dysentery epidemic has broken out in many villages in twelve counties including Gaoyang and Anguo, and treatment is actively underway. In Chu'an Village in Gaoyang County, 182 children have contracted the disease. In Chen Village, 45 people are ill, and 7 have already died. In four villages including Zhangjiaying in Anguo County, 344 people are ill, and 33 have already died. In Nanlianzikou Village in Lixian County, 56 out of 94 children under the age of eight or nine have contracted red dysentery, and 27 have already died. In Yangjizhuang and other villages in Dacheng County, scarlet fever has been discovered in children. In Yangjizhuang, a village of just over 30 households, more than 20 people have become ill in six days, and 8 have already died. Similar epidemics have occurred in Xianxian, Anping, Shenze, Baxian and other places. Statistics from twenty-one villages in twelve counties show that 254 people have died from the aforementioned epidemics, and 840 are currently ill. After the discovery of the epidemic, the county medical associations quickly organized rescue teams, medical teams, and epidemic prevention groups to rush to various villages to provide emergency treatment. The Health Bureau of the Jizhong Administrative Office has specifically notified all localities to report acute infectious diseases in a timely manner and to immediately organize rescue teams for treatment. The Jizhong Daobao published a short commentary to quickly eliminate and prevent epidemics, pointing out that the current mass is putting all effort in the production movement and the occurence of the diseases poses a large obstacle to mass production and the current production movement. The local leading bodies in the areas where the disease has occurred must, in the spirit of "life first," quickly organize Chinese and Western doctors to carry out emergency treatment and implement joint diagnosis and treatment. In areas where the disease has not occurred, medical associations should be the center for absorbing experienced Chinese and Western medical personnel to hold seminars, strengthen research on diseases and medicine, improve technology, and pass on prescriptions for treating diseases. They should also educate the masses to pay attention to family hygiene, prevent illness, and seek medical attention from doctors as soon as possible when they are sick, instead of relying on witches, so as to avoid serious illness and death.
