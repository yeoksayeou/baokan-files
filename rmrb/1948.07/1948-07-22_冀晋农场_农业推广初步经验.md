　　Preliminary Experiences in Agricultural Extension

　　Over the past year, the Ji-Jin Farm has gained some preliminary experience in carrying out agricultural extension work: First, it must proceed from reality; the scientific technologies promoted must possess four conditions: simple methods, significant effectiveness, cheap price, and easy-to-find materials, in order to be welcomed by farmers. For example, petroleum emulsion to control aphids and "PPF" to kill pear weevils have been very effective. However, they cost too much and the materials are not easy to buy, so the masses do not welcome them. Last year, the farm promoted the use of concentrated tobacco water and lime water to control aphids, diluted flour paste to control spider mites, and red alum, stone alkali noodles, and lime water to control pear weevils. The masses welcomed these methods because these things are easy to find and the price is cheap. Second, the promotion of technology must be carried out in coordination with cadres and the masses, and should not be done solely by farm personnel. The farm sent two or three people to Xizhao Factory in Quyang to spray ten pear trees with medicine to control weevils. The method was simple and the effect was very good, so the masses welcomed it. The county work team immediately mobilized the masses to imitate the spraying, and sprayed 10,000 trees in just a few days, saving a lot of labor for the villagers. The farm also sent seven or eight technical workers to Zhongguantou Village. They did not work with cadres and the masses, and sprayed for nearly sixty days on their own, but the masses did not move, and the technology was not popularized. Third, select key points, use bridges, and gradually promote. Key points should be selected based on: (A) the technical problems that local people most need to solve in agricultural production; (B) villages with model heroes; (C) marketplaces on main traffic routes with high traffic and faster dissemination are the most suitable. At the same time, labor heroes, primary school teachers, experienced old farmers, and village cadres with prestige among the masses should be selected as promotion bridges, provided they are willing. All good varieties and new technologies should first be used by these people as examples, and then the masses should be mobilized to learn, which is easier to accept. Last year, five key villages were identified in Quyang, and each key village focused on promoting only one new technology. Demonstration households were found in each village, and after significant results were achieved, promotion was gradually carried out from one household, one area, and one village. A successful initial effort makes promotion easier. Fourth, calculate accounts and make comparisons to get through ideological barriers. "It's good, but we can't afford to spend the money," said the masses in Anxia Village after seeing the promotion team spraying pear weevils with medicine. At that time, in response to the psychology of the masses, a general meeting was convened to calculate the number of workers and the amount of money spent on beating the weevils, and the amount of money spent on red alum, stone alkali noodles, and lime water to control the weevils, and a comparison was made. Everyone understood that the new method was still cheaper, and the next day ten farmers and village cadres organized and started to take action. Fifth, convene informal, unspecified numbers of old farmers' forums to first learn from their rich experience, and then bring out the new methods or good seeds that we plan to promote for everyone to discuss. Let them express their opinions as much as possible. After research, those that can be promoted locally become their opinions, and those that are not suitable can be modified or abandoned. This is much more effective than rigid and simple top-down communication and deployment. Sixth, last year, the Ji-Jin Farm recruited eleven agricultural technology trainees. During the slack season, they collectively learned general agricultural knowledge in the field. After the spring plowing began, they were divided into groups to go to the countryside to help the masses solve problems such as seed soaking, pear insect control, and weevils. The methods in the notebook were transformed into their true knowledge through personal experience. At the same time, it also powerfully helped the promotion work.

　　冀晋农场
  　农业推广初步经验
    冀晋农场一年来举办农业推广工作，开始摸到了几点初步经验：一、必须从现实出发；推行的科学技术必须具备方法简单、效力显著、价钱便宜、材料好找等四个条件，始能得到农民欢迎。如石油乳剂治蚜虫，“ＰＰＦ”杀梨步曲，都收效很大。但花钱太多，材料不易买到，结果群众不欢迎。去年农场所推广的大叶烟水、石灰水治蚜虫，稀面糊水治红蜘蛛，红矾、石咸面、石灰水治梨步曲等办法，群众都很欢迎，因这些东西很容易找，价钱也便宜。二、推广技术必须与干部群众协同一致，不能由农场人员单独去搞。农场派了两三个人到曲阳西赵厂，以药水喷治了十棵梨树的步曲，办法简单，效力很好，群众欢迎。县工作组马上发动群众仿效喷治，在短短的几天内就喷了一万棵，比老乡们打步曲节省了很多劳动力。农场也派了七、八个技术工作者到了中管头村，他们没有协同干部群众一起进行，自己喷治了将近六十天，群众还是不动，技术没有推广开。三、选择重点，通过桥梁，逐步推广。重点选择：（甲）当地群众在农业生产上最需要解决技术问题；（乙）有英模的村庄；（丙）交通要路来往人多，传播较快的集市为最宜。同时应选择群众中有威望的劳动英雄、小学教师、有丰富生产经验的老农和村干部，在其本人自愿的条件下，作为推广桥梁。一切好的品种和新的技术，先发动这些人作个样子，再发动群众学习，较易接受。去年在曲阳确定了五个重点村，一个重点村只着重推广一种新技术。每村找了示范户，作出显著成绩后，再由一户、一片、一村的逐步推广。一炮打响，推广就容易了。四、算帐比较，打通思想。“沾是沾，就是花不起钱”，岸下村群众看了推广小组药杀梨步曲的情形以后这么说。当时便针对着群众这种心理，召开大会，把打步曲用工花钱的数目和红矾、石咸面、石灰水治步曲花钱的数目，算了一笔帐，作了一个对比，大家明白了用新办法还是便宜，第二天就有十个农民和村干部组织起来，开始行动。五、召开不拘形式、不定人数的老农座谈会，先向他们学习丰富的经验，再把我们打算推广的新方法或好种籽拿出来和大家商量。尽量让他们多发表意见，经过研究，可以在当地推行的就变成了他们的意见，不合适的可以修改或放弃，这比生硬简单、由上而下的传达布置要有效的多。六、去年冀晋农场，招收了十一名农业技术练习生，农闲时在场内集体学习一般的农业知识，春耕开始后分组下乡，给群众解决浸种、治梨虫、步曲等问题。把笔记本上的办法经过亲身的体验，变为他们的真知识。同时也有力的帮助了推广工作。
