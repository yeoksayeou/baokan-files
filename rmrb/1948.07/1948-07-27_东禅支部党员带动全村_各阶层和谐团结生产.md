　　Taihang Telegram: After rectification, the Communist Party branch of Dongchan Village in the Fifth District of Ping Shun has undergone significant changes in its style, fully promoting the leading role of the Party, taking the lead in promoting the production movement, and making great achievements. Many party members have been selected as model party members within the branch, and model cadres among the masses. The relationship between the Party and the masses has been improved unprecedentedly. The prestige of the branch among the masses has been greatly enhanced. Since sowing, the village branch first led the masses to reorganize mutual aid teams under the principle of democratic, voluntary, and equivalent exchange, combining 42 groups (373 households, 573 full and semi-laborers of both sexes). The village’s 1,799 mu of grain land, 916 mu of corn, and 740+ mu of miscellaneous fields were all sown according to plan. After sowing, comrades Lu Laixing, a party member, and Huang Huazhang, the deputy village head, organized 15 male full laborers to engage in transportation during the slack farming season, earning 115,000 yuan (Jichao, same below), and personally led 20 laborers to work short-term jobs outside, earning 270,000 yuan. Semi-laborers and women were responsible for weeding (corn, cotton), ensuring that both agricultural and sideline production were not neglected. In late June, weeding and summer harvesting came at the same time. The branch promptly proposed to arrange life well and organized a large number of auxiliary laborers and semi-laborers to participate in weeding and summer harvesting, mobilizing 219 women to work in the fields. Party members took the lead, and summer harvesting and weeding were completed in about 20 days. The masses said: "This year is better and faster than in previous years." One of the reasons for the improvement in speed and quality is that mutual aid is truly based on voluntary association and equivalent exchange, and particularly because after the Party rectification, the whole village is harmonious and united, and everyone is motivated and willing to produce. In the past, the village did not have the habit of going to the fields before dawn, but this year they went to the fields before dawn. Party member cadres and labor heroes led the way more vigorously than in previous years, and women who had never worked in the fields before began to participate in labor. On the 10th of this month, the branch held a summary meeting to summarize this stage of production work and elected model party members. On the 11th, the whole village was divided into five regions to conduct mass summary of experiences, checking of shortcomings, and election of models. Many party members were elected as various models and heroes. Branch Secretary Cheng Baoyu and two other party members were elected as model cadres, Cheng Jiangze and six other party members were elected as labor heroes, Cheng Zhaocai (party member) and 12 others were elected as propaganda models, Niu Huaichun and 80 others were elected as production activists, and Niu Jushui and two other teams were elected as model teams, Guo Fujing and four other groups were elected as model groups. Party members and cadres truly played an exemplary and leading role in this production movement. The mutual aid team of Ma Buren (party member), the director of the production committee, had a total of 17 households, eight of which were poor people and bachelors, and three of which were wrongly criticized households. These people were either poor laborers or lacked agricultural implements and food. No one wanted to join their group when they combined for mutual aid. Comrade Buren organized them, helped them borrow food, and solved the difficulties with agricultural implements. During mutual aid, he gradually educated and transformed the poor people. Not only did they complete the summer harvest and weeding work, but they also took the time to work short-term jobs, earning 75,000 yuan. They are now elected as a model mutual aid team in the whole village. In addition to being responsible for leading the overall work, Branch Secretary Cheng Baoyu constantly and patiently educated in the group, transforming Cheng Shuanghai, Chen Jinshui, and four others who had not worked for many years and loved to eat and be lazy. Chen Jinshui was also elected as a production activist. Cheng Xiurong, a wrongly criticized household, actively led production and enthusiastically did propaganda work after correcting his status. In June, he submitted 10 articles to the newspaper and was elected as a propaganda model. Niu Fquan's team, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, had a Niu Huaifu, who felt that mutual aid was not free and voluntarily withdrew from the team. All those who participated in the mutual aid team weeded their seedlings well, but his seedlings were one foot high and could not be weeded. At this time, Fuquan went to talk to him about his thoughts, using the facts before him as an example, and persuaded him to join the mutual aid team again. At the summary election, labor hero Guo Xinnian (prosperous middle peasant) happily said: "In the past, I was uneasy and afraid of equal division, but now I am not afraid. I must boldly lead everyone to become rich under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and live a good life." Subsequently, the production committee rewarded the heroes and models respectively and reported the good news and merits to their families. The masses loved and supported the cadres and party members even more, and in the actual movement, they believed more in the Party's production and wealth-creation policies, breaking various concerns.

　　东禅支部党员带动全村
  　各阶层和谐团结生产
    【太行电】平顺五区东禅村中共支部经过整党后，作风已有显著转变，充分发扬了党的领导作用，带头推进生产运动，做出很大成绩。许多党员在支部内被选为模范党员，在群众中被选为模范干部，党与群众关系空前改善。支部在群众中的威信大大提高。下种以来，该村支部首先领导群众在民主自愿等价交换的原则下重新整顿了互助组，结合起四十二个小组，（三百七十三户，男女全半劳力五百七十三个）全村一千七百九十九亩谷地、九百一十六亩玉茭、七百四十余亩杂田，按计划全部完成下种。下种后，党员卢来兴和副村长黄花掌二同志，在农忙空隙中又有计划的组织了十五个男全劳力搞运输，赚洋十一万五千元（冀钞，下同），又亲自带领二十个劳力出外打短工，赚洋廿七万元。半劳力和妇女则负责锄杂苗（玉茭、棉花），做到农副生产两不误。六月下旬锄苗夏收一齐挤来，支部及时提出要很好安排生活，并组织大量辅助劳力与半劳力参加锄苗夏收，发动起二百一十九个妇女上地劳作，党员带头领导，二十天左右将夏收拔苗全部完成。群众说：“今年比往年都完成的好，完成的快。”好和快的原因之一，是因为互助真正作到自愿结合，等价交换，特别是由于整党以后，全村空气和谐团结，都有劲有心意生产了。过去该村没有起五更上地的习惯，今年天不明就上地了；党员干部和劳动英雄，比往年领导的都起劲，从来不登地边的妇女也开始参加了劳动。本月十日，支部召开总结会，总结这一段生产工作，选举了模范党员。十一日，全村分五个地区进行群众性的总结经验检查缺点和选举模范，许多党员被选为各种模范和英雄。支书程保玉等三个党员被选为模范干部，程江则等六个党员被选为劳动英雄，程招才（党员）等十二人被选为宣教模范，牛怀春等八十人被选为生产积极分子，牛聚水等两队被选为模范队，郭福景等四组被选为模范组。党员和干部在这段生产运动中，真正起了模范带头与骨干作用。生产委员会主任马布仁同志（党员）的互助组共十七户，其中八户是尖薄人和光棍，还有三户是错斗户。这些人不是劳动差，就是缺少农具吃喝。结合互助时谁也不愿和他们碰组。布仁同志把他们组织起来，帮助借粮食、解决农具困难。在互助中逐渐教育改造了尖薄人，不但完成了夏收锄苗工作，并抽空打短工，赚洋七万五千元，现在被选为全村模范互助组。支书程保玉除负责领导全盘工作外，在组内不断耐心教育，将长年不劳动爱吃懒做的程双孩、陈金水等四人改造过来，陈金水并被选为生产积极分子。错斗户程秀荣订正成份后，积极领导生产，热心作宣传工作，六月份给报上投稿十次，被选为宣教模范。武委会主任牛富全的组里有个牛怀富，觉得互助不自由，自动退了组，参加互助组的都把苗锄好了，他的苗子有一尺高，还锄不出来。富全这时去和他谈心思，以眼前的事实作例子，说服他又参加了互助组。总结选举时，劳动英雄郭辛年（富裕中农）高兴的说：“过去情绪不安，怕平分，现在可不怕了，一定要大胆领导大家发家致富，在共产党毛主席领导下过好时光。”随后，生产委员会即分别奖励各位英雄模范，并向他们的家庭报喜报功。群众对干部党员更加爱戴与拥护，且在实际运动中更加相信党的生产发家政策，打破了各种顾虑。
