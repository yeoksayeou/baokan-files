【Taiyue News】In Kongzhuang Village, Ji'nan Fifth District, cadres led all classes to unite in production for self-salvation, overcoming severe natural disasters. Last year, due to spring drought, 411 mu of land in the village failed to sprout, and the planted crops only yielded 30-40% of the usual harvest. Out of the 138 households in the village, 35 households ran out of food in the autumn, and 34 households "couldn't make ends meet" around the 20th of the first lunar month this year. People were panicking. Kong Lingyuan said, "This year is even more frightening than the famine of 1933!" Kong Fansheng said, "My family doesn't have a single grain of food, what should we do!" Some were preparing to flee the famine, while others were waiting for relief. At this time, the county called on the masses to engage in production for self-salvation. Village Chief Kong Xiangyun convened a village meeting, mobilizing everyone to unite and work hard to solve their own difficulties. He specifically announced that it was forbidden to force loans of grain from middle peasants. The pessimistic mood in the village slowly turned around, and 15 middle peasant households and 56 poor peasant households pooled together a capital of 235,000 yuan (Jizhao currency, same below) to set up an oil pressing cooperative, organizing seven livestock to press oil. In addition to fodder, each livestock earned one jin of oil per day of pressing. One person carried the oil to other villages to exchange for flower seeds, earning three jin of flower seeds for every jin of oil exchanged. Kong Fanli and 12 other middle peasants jointly engaged in long-distance transportation. From February to March 15, Kong Fanli alone earned 300,000 yuan, and even bought a mule in Henan. The other 12 people each earned an average of 100,000 yuan. Many people had no capital for production, and could not sell firewood they gathered in the mountains. Kong Xiangyun thought that oak shells could be picked, and quickly ran to the city to negotiate with the people who collected oak shells, pre-paying 950,000 yuan and agreeing to deliver 7,000 jin within three days, at a price of 190 yuan per jin. Xiangyun returned to the village and organized everyone to pick oak shells. He mobilized landlords and rich peasants, saying, "Whoever produces it owns it." He also said to the primary school students, "You also go pick, so you can eat well and study." Some people were afraid that they would not be able to deliver the goods after spending the money first, and would suffer embarrassment. Xiangyun then mobilized, saying, "Don't be afraid, as long as you work hard, if you can't deliver the goods on time, you can temporarily ask the cooperative to be responsible for paying for it." The whole village was mobilized, some picking and some going out to buy. On the first day, 2,300 jin were completed. At this time, the price of Xichengjin oak shells suddenly rose to 200 yuan per jin. Some people asked the village chief to refund the money, wanting to sell it at a higher price in Xichengjin. The village chief asked the instructor to negotiate in the city, while leading the masses to work hard. 7,500 jin were completed in three days. Coincidentally, at this time, the whole village had to send 30 people to deliver grain. Kong Xiangyun and everyone thought of a way to use ten livestock to replace manpower, freeing up labor to pick oak shells. The cooperative also lent out 50,000 yuan, so that the livestock could buy oak shells along the way when they returned from delivering grain. Both the task of delivering grain was completed and production was carried out. Within 25 days, the whole village picked a total of 27,000 jin of oak shells, earning 2.75 million yuan, equivalent to more than 30 shi of rice, solving the food shortage during the spring plowing and sowing period. The relationship between cadres and the masses became closer. The people said, "The village cadres work day and night, aren't they doing it for us, the people?" Others said, "If it weren't for the responsible leadership of the cadres, we wouldn't have earned so much money." Slowly, the sales of oak shells deteriorated. The village chief then thought of peeling bark to sell gouqi, and went to Qinyang to inquire about the market price of gouqi bark, and pre-paid 300,000 yuan with a buyer. Returning, he organized everyone to peel it. At that time, some people felt that 200 yuan per jin was too little. The village chief patiently explained and calculated the accounts for everyone, which was more profitable than other productions. In order to help everyone, the cooperative purchased in large quantities, and also lent capital to those who were willing to go out to buy. The whole village peeled and bought a total of 14,000 jin, earning 1.12 million yuan. To sum up, during this period, the whole village earned a total of 6.49 million yuan from running errands, selling oak shells, selling gouqi bark, and pressing oil, which could buy 110 shi of rice, overcoming the severe spring famine.

　　孔庄村干领导全村各阶层
    团结生产战胜灾荒
    【太岳讯】济源五区孔庄村，干部领导各阶层团结生产自救，战胜了严重的灾荒。这村去年因春旱，有四百一十一亩地没按住苗，种上的也只收了三、四成。全村一百三十八户，有三十五户秋天就没吃的，有三十四户到今年正月二十左右就“揭不开锅了”。人心惶惶。孔令元说：“今年比三十三年灾荒还怕！”孔凡生说：“我家没一颗粮食，这怎办呀！”有的已准备逃荒，有的等待救济。这时县上号召群众生产自救，村长孔祥运同志召开全村村民大会，动员大家团结起来，好好生产，解决自己的困难。他特别宣布了不能强迫向中农借粮。全村的悲观情绪慢慢扭转过来，就有十五户中农，五十六户贫农凑合了资本二十三万五千元（冀钞，下同），搞起一个榨油合作社，组织了七个牲口榨油。牲口除草料以外，榨一天赚一斤油。一个人担油到外村换花籽，换一斤油赚花籽三斤。孔凡礼等十三家中农合伙出外担贩运输，从二月到三月十五，孔凡礼一个人就赚了三十万元，还在河南买下一个骡子。其他十二个人每人平均都赚了十万元。很多人没本钱生产，上山打下柴火卖不了，孔祥运想到可以拾橡壳，赶忙跑到城里和收橡壳的人商量好，先支定钱九十五万元，约定三天里交货七千斤，每斤价洋一百九十元。祥运回村就组织大家上山拾橡壳，他动员地主富农说：“谁生产下是谁的。”又对小学生们说：“你们也去拾，吃饱饭好念书”。有些人怕先使钱交不了货受难为，祥运又动员说：“不怕，只要好好干，到期交不了货，可暂请合作社负责垫钱”。全村都动起来了，有的拾，有的出去收买，头一天就完成了二千三百斤。这时西承晋橡壳忽然涨了价，每斤涨到二百元，有些人向村长要求退款，要到西承晋去卖大价钱，村长便叫指导员去城里交涉，同时领导群众一股劲干，七千五百斤，三天就完成了。碰巧这时全村要出三十个人送粮，孔祥运就和大家想办法，抽十个牲口去顶人差，誊出人力拾橡壳，合作社又借出五万元，让牲口送粮回来，沿路收买橡壳，既完成送粮任务，又搞了生产，二十五天内全村共拾了橡壳二万七千斤，赚洋二百七十五万元，合米三十多石，解决了春耕下种时期的食粮困难。干部和群众的关系密切了，老百姓说：“村干部白天黑夜干，他们还不是为了咱老百姓？”还有的说：“不是干部负责领导，光咱也赚不下这些钱。”慢慢的，橡壳销路不好了，村长又想起剥树皮卖枸，就到沁阳打听枸树皮的行情，和买客预支了三十万定钱，回来组织大家剥，当时有些人嫌每斤二百元太少，村长就耐心解释，给大家算了一下帐，比其他生产都赚钱。合作社为了帮助大家，大量收买，有人愿出去收买，合作社还借给本钱。全村连剥带买共一万四千斤，得利一百一十二万元。总结全村在这一时期，跑脚、卖橡壳、卖枸皮、榨油等共收入六百四十九万元，能买米一百一十石，战胜了严重的春荒。
