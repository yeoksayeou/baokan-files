　　Taiyue District Party Committee Instruction
  　Study the Resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Party
    【Taiyue Telegraph】The Propaganda Department of the Taiyue District Party Committee issued a notice on July 14, instructing Party committees at all levels and all Party cadres to study the Cominform's "Resolution on the Communist Party of Yugoslavia" and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on this issue. The notice pointed out: This is an extremely important historical document, and all Party cadres must earnestly implement the Central Committee's decision: "Conscientiously study the Cominform meeting's resolution on the issue of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to strengthen education within the Party regarding class, the Party, internationalism, the spirit of self-criticism, and discipline." Regarding study methods, cadres above the county level should mainly repeatedly read and discuss and study, using forms such as seminars, casual talks, small groups, and larger discussion meetings; cadres below the county level should mainly adopt the method of lecturing in class, focusing on the study of cadres above the county level. It is important to know that this is the most basic and practical form of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought study. If the documents can be studied well, one's theoretical and political level can be greatly improved, and one's class consciousness and Party concept can be greatly enhanced.

　　太岳区党委指示
  　学习关于南共决议
    【太岳电】太岳区党委宣传部在七月十四日发出通知，指示各级党委及全党干部学习共产党情报局“关于南斯拉夫共产党的决议”及中共中央关于这一问题的决议。指出：这是极其重要的历史文献，全党干部必须切实执行中央决定：“认真研究共产党情报局会议关于南斯拉夫共产党问题的决议，借以加强党内关于阶级的、党的、国际主义的、自我批评精神和纪律性的教育。”关于学习方法，县以上干部主要应反复阅读与讨论研究，用座谈、漫谈、小组及较大的讨论会等形式；县以下干部主要应采用上课讲解的办法，重点放在县以上干部的学习。要知这是最基本最实际的一种马列主义——毛泽东思想的学习，如能将文件学好，即可将自己的理论政治水平大大提高一步，并把阶级觉悟与党的观念大大提高。
