Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th. The East China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, the Headquarters and Political Department of the East China Military Region, and the Shandong Provincial Government jointly sent a letter of condolence to all honored soldiers in East China on the "July 7th" anniversary. The original letter stated in brief: At the time of preparing to welcome the national revolutionary victory, it makes us more deeply aware of the meritorious servants of the Chinese people—the honored soldiers who, with selfless spirit, shed blood and sacrificed for the people in the cause of people's liberation, and created immortal feats. Although you have suffered physical damage, your achievements are great and your thoughts are healthy. Therefore, after returning to the local areas, you actively participated in production, supporting the front, land reform, and other constructive work, and always stood on the revolutionary front to fight tirelessly. This spirit is worthy of our admiration. Here, we warmly extend our cordial greetings and respect to you. The letter finally encouraged the honored soldiers to say: We should listen to Chairman Mao's words, further play a core exemplary role in production, supporting the front, and other work, organize the masses, raise the awareness of the masses, highly develop revolutionary heroism, and happily complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the Chinese people, do a good job, and welcome victory.

　　　　Dazhong Daily Editorial Calls For
　　Party, Government, Army and People Should All Do a Good Job in Honored Soldiers Work　Honored Soldiers Should Strengthen Discipline, Production and Learning
[Also News] Shandong Dazhong Daily published an editorial on "July 7th" entitled "Salute to Honored Soldiers," pointing out that the work for honored soldiers in the past has been successful, with achievements in guaranteeing the lives of honored soldiers, political and cultural education, placement, and mobilizing them to return to the team. There are also many model deeds among the honored soldiers, such as saving money on food and clothing and donating disability funds to support the front. Many comrades work despite illness. In the past year, nearly 20,000 honored soldiers recovered from their injuries and returned to the front to kill the enemy. This all demonstrates the revolutionary heroism of the honored soldiers. The editorial continued to point out: There are still some shortcomings and errors in the work. For example, some places do not care about the lives of honored soldiers, and individual honored soldiers do not abide by government laws and disciplines, etc., and these errors must be corrected in a timely manner. The editorial put forward two requirements: (1) Party, government, military, and civilian organizations at all levels, Ronggong (Honored Workers) organs, and responsible comrades at all levels should attach importance to this work ideologically and realize that the quality of this work is directly related to the combat effectiveness and morale of the front. It is absolutely impossible to take an attitude of disgust, alienation, or even confrontation toward the honored soldiers because of the temporary poor performance of individual honored soldiers. We should review the work of honored soldiers in the past year, commend the good ones, overcome the bad phenomena, and even criticize and punish them when necessary. (2) Honored soldiers must abide by government laws, love the people, and must not think that they have contributed to the revolution and can destroy government laws and military-civilian relations. You must know that if the people's heroes are separated from the people, or even stand against the people, they will be opposed by the people. I hope that the honored soldiers will manage their bodies despite their glorious injuries and disabilities, but they must maintain ideological health. Always maintain the noble quality of serving the people, and become a model of discipline, learning, production, and all construction work, and always be respected by the people.

　　　　Honored Soldier Comrade Yao Jie
Comrade Yao Jie is a specially honored soldier who is blind in both eyes and is now the political commissar of the Honored Soldiers Rehabilitation Institute. Although he has lost his sight, he has always maintained a high degree of work enthusiasm and a spirit of responsibility for the revolution. In 1944, he asked someone to read him the book "How Steel Was Made?" (Note: This book is a famous work by the Soviet writer Ostrovsky, in which the protagonist Paul is a young worker who contributes all his energy to arduous revolutionary work, resulting in injury and disability. Later, only his ears, mouth, and one hand can be used, but he still insists on working for the party to the end). He was greatly encouraged. He asked someone to read the entire book to him three times, and paragraph 17 was read more than seven times. He most admired the main character Paul's tenacious and unyielding spirit and his selfless work for the party, and asked himself to try his best to learn from Paul. Therefore, whenever he encountered difficulties, he used Paul's work spirit to encourage himself.
His only assistants in his work are a clerk and a literate correspondent. He often asks the clerk to read the instructions of the superiors to him, and then grasp the spirit of the documents, combine them with the actual situation, and then formulate a work plan. To make a summary report, he dictates it and the clerk records it. He used these methods to overcome the difficulties in his work.
The hospital headquarters is about a mile away from the nearest squadron, and three or four miles away from the farthest. Political Commissar Yao asked the correspondent to help him go to the squadrons to understand the situation no matter how far or near; he also went for a walk on rainy days. Many comrades said: "Political Commissar Yao knows the situation more clearly than people with eyes." During the Three Check-Ups, he went to the class to participate in meetings every day, and corrected the bias in the class immediately when he discovered it. He often enlightened everyone with examples of how the work was done well in other teams, and gave instructions to everyone in a patient and persuasive manner.
In July last year, twenty deaf honored soldiers came to the Rehabilitation Institute. There was not enough time to arrange the beds. Political Commissar Yao gave up his bed and slept on the ground. So the comrades in the hospital department voluntarily gave up their beds. Once, two deaf honored soldiers had problems with their lives and were emotionally unstable. He asked someone to lead them to see his living conditions. After seeing it, the two comrades were very moved and rested in the hospital with peace of mind. There are six classes in the whole hospital, and some of the squad leaders are specially disabled. The first time the squad leader meeting was held, it happened to be raining at night, and it was very difficult for the squad leaders to go back. Political Commissar Yao regretted calling them to come. After that, he always went to the bottom to facilitate everyone. No matter whose ideology fluctuated, he patiently persuaded and educated them. Sun Chenglin, a specially honored soldier, was also blind in both eyes and hard of hearing. He went to chat with him every two or three days to comfort him, so that he could recognize a bright and optimistic future, and his emotions turned to stability and happiness. So some comrades said: "Political Commissar Yao is really a mental doctor!" [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th]

　　华东中央局、军区、山东省府
    联函慰问华东荣军
    勉励荣军努力生产支前迎接胜利
    【新华社华东十四日电】中共华东中央局、华东军区司令部、政治部、山东省政府，于“七七”联合致函慰问华东全体荣誉军人同志。原函略称：在准备迎接全国革命胜利的时候，使我们更深切地想到中国人民的功臣——荣誉军人在人民解放事业中，以忘我的精神，流血牺牲，为人民创立了不朽的功绩。你们虽然在肉体上遭受了损伤，但你们的功绩是伟大的，思想是健康的。因此当你们回到地方后，又积极地参加了生产、支前、土改及其他建设性的工作，始终站在革命战线上奋斗不息，这种精神是值得我们钦佩的。我们在这里热烈地向你们致亲切的慰问和敬意。该函最后勉励荣誉军人同志们称：应该听毛主席的话，在生产、支前等工作中进一步地起核心模范作用，组织群众，提高群众的觉悟程度，高度的发扬革命英雄主义，愉快地去完成当前中国人民交给我们的光荣任务，做好工作，迎接胜利。
    　　　　大众日报社论号召
    　　党政军民都要作好荣军工作　荣军应强加遵纪生产学习
    【又讯】山东大众日报于“七七”发表题为“向荣誉军人同志们致敬”的社论，指出过去对于荣誉军人的工作是有成绩的，在荣誉军人生活的保证上，政治文化教育上，安插及动员归队上，都有成就。而荣誉军人中也有很多模范的事迹，如自己省吃节用，将残废金等献出支援前线，许多同志抱病工作，一年来有将近两万个荣军伤愈重返前线杀敌。这都表现出荣誉军人的革命英雄主义气概。社论继又指出：在工作中也还存在着一些缺点、错误。如某些地方对荣誉军人同志生活不关心，个别荣誉军人同志不遵守政府法令及纪律等，必须及时纠正这些错误。社论提出两点要求：（一）各级党政军民团体，各荣工机关，各级负责同志，应从思想上重视这一工作，认识到这一工作的好坏，是直接关系着前方战斗力与部队情绪的。切不可以个别荣誉军人的一时的不良表现，而对荣誉军人采取厌恶、疏远、甚至对抗态度。应该检讨过去一年的荣军工作，对好的予以表扬，对不良的现象加以克服，甚至必要时予以批评处分。（二）荣誉军人要遵守政府法令，爱护人民，切不可自以为对革命有功，便可以破坏政府法令及军民关系。要知道人民功臣如果脱离了人民，甚至与人民对立，那就要被人民反对的。希望荣誉军人管身体因光荣负伤而残废了，但要保持思想上的健康。永远保持为人民服务的高贵品质，成为遵纪、学习、生产及一切建设工作的模范，永远受到人民的尊敬。
    　　　　荣誉军人姚杰同志
    姚杰同志是个双目失明的特等荣誉军人，现在是荣军教养院的政治委员。他虽然已丧失视觉，但是始终保持高度的工作积极性和对革命负责的精神。在一九四四年时，他请人把“钢铁是怎样炼成的？”一书读给他听（按：该书是苏联作家奥斯特洛夫斯基名著，其中主角保尔是一个青年工人，贡献其全部精力于艰巨的革命工作，致因伤残废，后来四肢五官只有两耳一口一手能用，但他仍坚持为党工作到底），受到了很大的鼓励。他共请人把全书向他读了三遍，其中第十七段读了七遍之多。他最钦佩该书主要人物保尔那种顽强不屈及忘我的为党工作的精神，要求自己竭力向保尔学习。因此，每当遇到困难的时候，他就拿保尔的工作精神来勉励自己。
    在他工作中唯一的助手是文书和一个识字的通讯员。他时常叫文书把上级的指示读给他听，然后掌握文件的精神，结合实际情况，再订出工作计划。要做总结报告便由他口述由文书笔录。就用这些办法，他克服了工作中的困难。
    教养院院部离各中队近的有一里路，远的有三、四里。姚政委无论远近都叫通讯员搀扶着他到各中队去了解情况；下雨天也要去走一走。许多同志说：“姚政委比有眼睛的人了解的情况还要清楚。”在三查中，他每天都到班里去参加会议，发现班里有偏向时就即时纠正。他常常把别的队里工作是怎样做好的例子启发大家，循循善诱地给大家指示。
    去年七月里，教养院来了二十个耳聋的荣军同志，一时搞床铺不及，姚政委便让出自己的床位，睡到地上去，于是院部的同志都把床铺自动让了出来。有一次两个耳聋的荣军同志闹生活问题，情绪不安，他便叫人领他们来看看自己的生活状况。这两个同志看后便很受感动地安心院里休养。全院共有六班，有的班长是特等残废。第一次开班长会议时，碰巧晚上下雨，班长们回去都很困难。姚政委很懊悔叫他们来，以后开会他总是到下边去就大家的便。无论那个同志思想发生波动，他都很耐心地进行说服教育，有一个特等荣军孙呈麟也是双目失明，两耳重听。他便三天两头地去和他闲谈，安慰他，使他认识光明乐观的前途，情绪转为安定愉快。所以有的同志说：“姚政委实在是精神医师！”【新华社华东十四日电】
