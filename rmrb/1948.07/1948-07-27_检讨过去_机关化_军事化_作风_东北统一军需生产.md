　　Reviewing Past "Bureaucratic" and "Militarized" Work Styles
　　Northeast Unifies Military Supplies Production
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: In order to adapt to the development of the war situation, the Northeast People's Liberation Army Military Region Headquarters established a Military Supplies Production Department in May to uniformly lead the military supplies production of the entire army and be responsible for supplying all military needs of the Northeast troops. The military supplies production units established by various troops and organizations in the past have been abolished. The department held a joint meeting of bureau chiefs and factory directors in the middle of last month to discuss issues such as improving production organization, factory management, and wages. The meeting reviewed the "bureaucratic" and "militarized" management styles of the military supplies factories in the past. In the past, too many personnel in most factories received supply system treatment; in some factories, non-production personnel accounted for more than 35%. As a result, costs were higher than those of private factories. The management of some factories was completely militarized, with workers going to work, and attending meetings after work, and the management of workers was too restrictive. In terms of production, due to decentralized operations, the styles and quality of products were not uniform, and operations were unplanned, resulting in staggering waste. After careful research by the bureau chiefs, factory directors, and technicians, various production standards were determined. For example, clothing, shoes, hats, etc., were all subject to unified style standards and quality standards based on the principles of durability, practicality, and economy. According to the new clothing standards, 2.3 square feet of cloth can be saved for each set of cotton clothes. After the quality of the shoes is improved, one pair of shoes per person can also be saved each year. Comrade Li Fuchun of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC called on logistics staff at the meeting to always pay attention to saving people's resources, and at the same time, to have a high degree of spirit to complete tasks and obey discipline. He particularly pointed out that in the past, not only was there great waste due to decentralized production, poor planning, and poor management, but also great waste due to poor warehouse management and transportation organization. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen business and improve business, and strive to eliminate waste in production, storage and transportation.
According to the department: Military supplies production in various places has begun to show a new atmosphere after the meeting. Factories have generally begun to move towards enterprise. Personnel who originally received supply system treatment have been changed to a salary system after evaluation, and non-production personnel have been greatly streamlined. For example, the non-production personnel of the Third Clothing Factory have been reduced to 6%. In terms of management methods, the undemocratic phenomena of military management, command-style management, and simple punishment in the past have been corrected. In the past, units without trade unions have generally established trade unions, and outstanding workers have been selected to study in trade union cadre training classes.

　　检讨过去“机关化”“军事化”作风
  　东北统一军需生产
    【新华社东北二十四日电】东北解放军军区司令部为适应战争形势的发展，特于五月间成立军需生产部，统一领导全军军需生产，负责供应东北所有部队军需。过去各部队、机关所设之军需生产单位则一律取消。该部于上月中旬曾召开局长、厂长联席会议，讨论改进生产组织、工厂管理及工资等问题。会议检讨了过去各军需工厂“机关化”、“军事化”的管理作风。过去大部工厂按供给制待遇的人员过多；有的工厂非生产人员竟占百分之三十五以上。因此成本比私营工厂高。某些工厂管理完全军事化，上班做工，下班开会，对工人的管理上限制过严。在生产上，由于分散经营，出品式样和质量不统一，经营无计划，造成惊人的浪费。经各局长、厂长与技工的精密研究，确定了各种生产标准。如衣服、鞋、帽等都按结实、适用、节约的原则划定统一的式样标准与质量标准。按着新的服装标准，每套棉衣即可节省布二点三方尺。鞋的质量提高后，每人每年亦可节省一双鞋。中共东北局李富春同志在会上号召后勤工作人员要时刻注意节省人民资材，同时要有高度完成任务，服从纪律的精神。他特别指出过去不仅因生产分散及计划不精、管理不良有很大浪费，而且由于仓库管理、运输组织不好也有很大浪费。今后必须加强业务提高业务，为消灭生产中、保管中及运输中的浪费现象而斗争。
    据该部称：各地军需生产在会议后已开始呈现新的气象。工厂普遍开始走向企业化。原按供给制待遇的人员一律经过评定改为工薪制，非生产人员大量精简，如第三被服厂非生产人员已减到百分之六。在管理方法上，纠正了过去军事管理，命令包办，单纯惩罚的不民主现象。过去没有工会的单位，普遍成立工会，并选派优秀职工到工会干部训练班学习。
