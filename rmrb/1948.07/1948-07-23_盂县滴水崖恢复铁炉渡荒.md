【North Yue News】Due to drought in Yu County's Drip Cliff, 34 out of 51 households in the entire village had nothing to eat. In order to overcome the famine, Liang Shuanzi, the village branch secretary, and others organized an iron smelting furnace with a total of nine people. To save expenses, all nine people ate at home, each receiving only seven and a half *he* of sorghum per day, mixed with wild vegetables. From the start of work on May 20th to June 20th, within one month, the share capital increased from 320,000 (border currency) to 2.4 million, and the number of shareholders increased from 16 to more than 20. They have already smelted more than 140 batches, producing more than 15,000 *jin* of wrought iron. Each 1,000 *jin* of wrought iron can be sold for one *shi* and seven *dou* of millet (according to the market price at that time). After deducting the principal from the inventory, they made a net profit of four *shi* and eight *dou* (large *shi*) of millet. With the iron smelting furnace restored, the transportation industry has also developed. More than ten households, including poor peasant Han Taili, hoe seedlings on the one hand, and take time to transport iron to the riverbed, and carry grain back on the other. Han Taixiao carries 60 *jin* each time, and his brother's wife, Zhang Sanyun, carries 40 *jin*. Each round trip a day earns about 15,000 yuan. Twenty or so households with nothing to eat have found a way. Everyone is in high spirits and now plans to restore another Mongolian iron furnace. (Tian Fu, Wang Fangming)

　　盂县滴水崖恢复铁炉渡荒
    【北岳讯】盂县滴水崖因年时遭旱灾，全村五十一户，有三十四户没吃的。为了渡过灾荒，该村支书梁拴子等领导组织了一座铁炉共九人。为了节省花销，九人都在家里吃饭；每人每日只支高梁七合半，掺搅野菜吃。从五月二十日开工到六月二十日一个月内，股金即由三十二万（边币）发展到二百四十万，股东由十六家增到二十多家。已炒了一百四十余炉，出熟铁一万五千余斤，每千斤熟铁能卖一石七斗小米（按当时市价）。连存货除了股本，净赚小米四石八斗（大石）。铁炉恢复后，运输业也跟着开展了。贫农韩太力等十多户一面锄苗，一面抽空往河底送铁，回来担粮食。韩太小每次担六十斤，他兄弟媳妇张三云担四十斤，每天一个来回，能赚一万五千元左右。二十来户没饭吃的有了办法。大家情绪很高，现又计划恢复一座蒙铁炉。（田夫、王方明）
