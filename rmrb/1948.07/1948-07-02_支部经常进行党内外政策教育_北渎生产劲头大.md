　　Branch Frequently Conducts Policy Education Inside and Outside the Party
	North Du's Production Enthusiasm is High
　　[This Newspaper’s Report] Recently, this reporter passed through Gaoyi County and heard that the masses in Beidu Village in the Fourth District of the county had a very high production enthusiasm. Therefore, I made a special visit to the village and had talks with Comrade Wang, a district cadre, as well as village cadres, party members, mutual aid team leaders, and more than a dozen middle and poor peasants. After one day and two nights of individual interviews, small-scale discussions, and visits to homes, it was proven that the production enthusiasm of the masses in Beidu was indeed good. For example, during the five months of production and famine relief last winter and this spring, the village engaged in sideline production such as spinning, carrying burdens, burning lime, and moving stones (for house repairs and sales to other villages), earning a net profit of 13.59 million yuan (Jizhong Bank notes, same below), equivalent to 260 shi of millet. Currently, all 1,990 mu of autumn seedlings in the village have been weeded twice, and 305 mu of cotton have been weeded three times. Out of 1,000 mu of wheat stubble land, except for more than 400 mu of sandy land that is not suitable for autumn crops (due to water erosion), the rest has been planted, and some have been weeded once. This year, the village has added 13 large carts, bringing the total to 38. The above facts show that since Gaoyi County proposed democratic party consolidation and replenishment this spring, Beidu Village's production has been even more vigorous than during last year's production for self-salvation; the production enthusiasm of all strata is generally good. Many poor and middle peasants are not only actively engaged in production but have also begun to build houses. The two households building houses that I visited were Liang Huiyin and Liang Qingdan's mother. The latter is a peasant who has turned over and is rushing to repair the house because it is too small. The former is a middle peasant who lacked a place to put his cart and has been actively preparing materials this spring (just the lime requires three kilns), and will start construction after the busy season in the fields. It is said that there are four other middle peasant households building houses with them.
    Why is Beidu Village able to actively produce? After talking with Comrade Wang, the district cadre, the village head, the chairman of the farmers' association, the production director, the cooperative head, and the branch secretary, as well as chatting with farmers such as Liang Huiyin and Liang Chunlan, I understood that this is the result of implementing the Party's policies:
    First of all, the Party branch committee of Beidu uses the Party's policies as a weapon to conduct criticism and self-criticism, educate party members, strengthen internal party unity, and truly play the backbone role of branch party members. The Beidu Village branch was established and strengthened in the struggle against the Japanese. When the Japanese and puppet forces built a blockhouse in the west of the village (before 1944), they supported the masses in carrying out secret struggles in the form of "autumn watching teams" and "secret guerrilla groups." When the War of Resistance Against Japan was won, they actively led the masses in anti-traitor liquidation and land reform to achieve liberation. Last year, during the great famine, branch party members and non-party cadres led the masses in production for self-salvation, enabling all 180 households and 770 people in the village to successfully overcome the serious famine, which was highly supported by the masses. This spring, before the county party committee convened a meeting of the main cadres of all villages in the county to mobilize for party consolidation, the secretary of the branch, the village head, the chairman of the farmers' association, the militia instructor, and the public security officer had fluctuations in their thinking due to insufficient understanding of the party consolidation policy, and production was once not very energetic. Soon after, the county party committee convened a meeting of main village cadres to mobilize for party consolidation, repeatedly explaining to everyone that party consolidation is to further combine the party with the masses, remove all obstacles that isolate the party from the masses, treat illnesses and save people, and improve all party members by an inch in Mao Zedong Thought. It called on everyone to correct mistakes if they have them, encourage those who have no mistakes, and lead production well in order to continue to gain mass support or make up for past mistakes in the production movement. Recalling history, comrades such as Liang Shuhai, the branch secretary, and Liang Guilin, the village head, remembered the pain of being a long-term worker in the past and how they were liberated when the Communist Party came, which awakened their class consciousness. First of all, they affirmed one point: "Listening to the Party is never wrong, and lying down and doing nothing is not right!" Returning to the village, they immediately convened a branch meeting to explain that party consolidation is to transform thinking and work style, not to struggle against party members and cadres. And at the second and third branch meetings (once every ten days), they read the Party newspaper and studied the various instructions of the higher party committee, focusing on this aspect because everyone was very concerned about party consolidation at that time. After the party members listened to the experience of Zhao Zhuang in the Ninth District of Wu'an in party consolidation and the branch secretary conveyed the situation of party consolidation in Xiliangzhuang, Gaoyi, they all said: "Correct mistakes if you have them, return what you have gained too much, and work must be done actively!" At the fourth and fifth branch meetings, they focused on discussing how to lead the masses in production. The enthusiasm for production has increased again.
    At the same time, party members and cadres pay attention to publicizing the Party's policies, so that the policies become the masses' own things and they become active. Old men Liang Laotai and Liang Er'ou get up before dawn to collect manure and desperately apply it to the fields. Liang Laotai's wheat yielded an average of one dou more per mu than others this year, and he regrettedfully said: "If the rain hadn't beat down on my mu of wheat, it would have yielded an extra bag (four dou)!" There are two ways to publicize policies: one is individual talks; the other is reading the newspaper at night school. The reading group reads first, and then questions are raised for discussion and resolution. The masses have become interested in reading the newspaper, and now everyone is concerned about policies because it is inseparable from their lives; Even now, during the busy farming season, the three-day night school newspaper reading system is still maintained.
    In the South and North Bridge villages in the same base area, a district cadre (Qi Xiao, an armed cadre of the Fourth District) suddenly came during the production period and convened a meeting. Regardless of right or wrong, he went on stage and announced: "Those who have a cadre flavor have no right to speak, and all of them must go out!" He kicked the old organization away, making the cadres pessimistic and the masses afraid. Those who were originally going to stand up also lay down, creating a chaotic situation. The work in Beidu Village is based on both the instructions of the higher authorities and the actual situation of the village, so it has not been affected by any external influences.

### 支部经常进行党内外政策教育　北渎生产劲头大

　　支部经常进行党内外政策教育
    北渎生产劲头大
    【本报讯】日前记者路过高邑，听说该县四区北渎村群众生产情绪很高，乃专访该村，和区干部王同志及村干部、党员、互助组长、以及十多个中贫农晤谈，经过一天两夜的个别访问、小型座谈及上门探望结果，证明北渎群众生产情绪果真不错。例如：去冬今春五个月生产渡荒时，该村搞纺织、担挑、烧石灰、搬石头（修房用，销售外村）等副业生产，净赚红利一千三百五十九万元（冀钞，下同），折合小米二百六十石。现全村一九九○亩秋苗已锄二遍，三○五亩棉花已锄够三遍，一○○○亩麦茬地除四百多亩沙地不宜种秋庄稼（水冲）外，其余全按上苗，有的已锄过一遍。今年全村增加十三辆大车，连以前的共有三十八辆。以上的事实说明：今年春天高邑县提出民主整党抽补以来，北渎村生产比去年生产自救时干得还红；各阶层生产情绪普遍好。许多贫农、中农不仅积极生产，而且开始修建房屋，记者访问的两家修房户，一叫梁会银，一是梁青淡娘，后者是个翻身户，嫌房子狭小，正请人赶修；前者是个中农，因缺少个放车的地方，今年春天积极筹备材料（光石灰就得用三窑），待地里活忙过就动手修，据说和他们一起修房的还有四家中农。
    为什么北渎村能积极生产？记者和区干部王同志、村长、农会主任、生产主任合作社长、支部书记交谈，又和梁会银、梁春兰等农民闲谈结果，明白了这是由于贯彻党的政策的结果：
    首先，北渎党的支部委员会，他们是经常用党的政策作武器，进行批评与自我批评，教育党员，加强党内团结，真正发挥了支部党员的骨干党作用。北渎村的支部是在对日斗争中建设与壮大起来的，日伪在村西按炮楼时（一九四四年前），支持曾以“看秋队”、“秘密游击小组”等形式，领导群众进行秘密斗争。抗战胜利时，又积极领导群众反奸清算，进行土地改革闹翻身。去年大灾荒，支部党员和非党干部又带领群众生产自救，使全村一百八十户，七百七十口人，胜利渡过严重的灾荒，颇得群众拥护。今年春天，县委召集全县各村主要干部会，动员整党以前，由于对整党政策不够了解，支部书记、村长、农会主任、民兵指导员、公安员五个人思想都有波动，生产一度曾不起劲。不久县委召开主要村干会，动员整党，向大家一再说明：整党是使党与群众更进一步结合，去掉一切隔绝党与群众的障碍，是治病救人，使所有党员在毛泽东思想上提高一寸。号召大家有错改错，无错加勉，好好领导生产，以便在生产运动中继续取得群众拥护或将功补过。回忆历史时，支书梁书海、村长梁桂林等同志，想起过去当长工的痛苦，共产党来了才得到翻身的情形，唤醒了自己的阶级意识，首先肯定一点：“听党的话永没错，躺倒不干可不对！”回到村里，马上召集支部大会，说明整党是改造思想、改造作风，并不是斗争党员干部。并在第二、第三次支部大会（每十天一次）上朗读党报，研究上级党各种指示，当时大家对整党很关心，便着重念这方面的东西。党员听罢武安九区赵庄整党经验及支书传达高邑西良庄整党情况后，都说：“有错改错，多得要退，工作还要积极干！”第四、第五次支部大会，便着重讨论如何领导群众生产的问题。生产的劲头又大起来了。
    同时，党员干部注意宣传党的政策，使政策成为群众自己的东西，积极起来。老汉梁老台、梁二偶天不明就起来拾粪拼命往地里上，梁老台的麦子今年每亩平均比别人多收一斗，他还很惋惜的说：“要不是雨拍着我那亩麦子，就得多打他一布袋（四斗）！”宣传政策的方式有两个：一是个别谈话；一是在夜校上读报，先由读报小组念，然后再提出问题讨论解决，群众对读报已发生兴趣，现在是人人关心政策，因为这和他们的生活分不开；直到现在农忙时，三天一夜校的读报制度仍保持着。
    在同一基点内的南、北桥等村，生产期间突然来了个区干部（四区武装干事，名齐小），召开大会，不管是非轻重，上台就宣布说：“沾有干部味的，没有发言权，一律出去！”把旧组织一脚踢开，使干部悲观，群众害怕。原来要站起来的也躺倒了，造成一片混乱现象。而北渎村的工作是既从上级指示又从本村情况出发，所以未受什么外来的影响。
