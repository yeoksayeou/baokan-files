　　The Destruction of King Kong Ridge
　　　　Yù Xiù
　　White Lion Ridge is located twenty-five li southeast of Qi County. It is surrounded by gullies on three sides and leans against a mountain on one side. It directly controls the important town of Zihong, the Changyuan River, and the Baijin Road below the ridge. It is located at the throat of Shangdang entering central Shanxi, with a strategically important position. It was the barrier for the Yan bandit [Yan Xishan] to control Tai(yuan) and Qi(xian). The Yan bandits built two large "plum blossom" blockhouses, each over three zhang high, and three "plum blossom" large bunkers on the mountain, surrounded by dense small bunkers, all made of steel and concrete. There were three outer trenches outside the large blockhouses: the first was a five-meter-high sloping cut (i.e., trench) with obstacles like chevaux de frise set up on the trench; the second was a widened communication trench made of accumulated soil; and the third was a seven-meter-wide outer trench. The firepower between the bunkers intersected to form a fire network. The Yan bandits themselves called this White Lion Ridge the impregnable "King Kong Ridge." On the evening of June 30, a unit of the People's Liberation Army attacked White Lion Ridge. The troops were moving tensely day and night, and the artillerymen were carefully correcting their artillery positions on the position. The phone in the command post was busy all night. At five o'clock the next morning, the order to attack was issued from the phone at the command post. One after another, cannonballs heavily hit the Yan bandit's blockhouse complex on the top of the ridge, with bricks, tiles, and wood rising into the air, and obstacles and dust flying everywhere. Two hours passed, and almost all the large and small blockhouses made of steel and concrete had been destroyed, revealing many gaps in the communication trenches. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, the infantry immediately began to charge. Wang Wanshun, the squad leader of the fifth squad of the eighth company of a certain unit, led his assault team, using grenades to defeat the enemy's resistance, broke through the obstacles in six minutes, and occupied the first blockhouse. Comrade Ren Guowang of the second echelon of the squad followed up, and one person set up a ladder weighing more than ninety pounds that required two people to carry. Our subsequent troops continued to charge up and launched a fierce battle for the blockhouses. The sound of artillery fire shook the banks of the Changyuan River, and the smoke of gunpowder covered White Lion Ridge. Despite the enemy's planes constantly circling overhead, dropping bombs, and strafing, under the heroic attack and coordinated actions of our infantry and artillery, after six and a half hours of fierce fighting, the Yan bandits finally could not save the destruction of their "King Kong Ridge." The defending enemy, the Third Battalion of the First Regiment of the Thirty-seventh Division of the Yan bandits, perished with it. [Taihang Telegram]

　　金钢岭的毁灭
    玉秀
    白狮岭位于祁县城东南二十五里，三面是沟，一面靠山，直接控制着岭下的子洪重镇、昌源河及白晋路，正当上党进入晋中的咽喉，地势险要，是阎匪控制太（谷）、祁（县）的屏障。阎匪在山上筑有两个高约三丈多的梅花大碉堡，和三个梅花大地堡，周围密布小碉，全为钢骨水泥建筑。大碉外面有三道外壕：第一道高五公尺劈坡（即壕沟），壕上设有鹿砦；第二道系积土加宽的交通壕；第三道为七公尺宽外壕。各碉堡间火力交叉构成火网。阎匪自称这个白狮岭是攻打不破的“金钢岭”。六月三十日晚，解放军某部进攻白狮岭。部队在日夜里紧张地运动着，炮兵连的战士伏在阵地上细心地修正炮位。指挥所的电话忙碌了一个通宵。第二天早晨五点钟，从指挥所的电话上发出了攻击的命令，连珠似的炮弹一颗一颗地重重击打着岭头上阎匪的碉堡群，砖瓦木材腾空而起，鹿砦尘土到处飞扬。两点钟过去了，所有钢骨水泥的大小碉堡，差不多都被轰毁了，交通沟上显露出不少的缺口。在猛烈炮火掩护下，步兵随即开始冲锋。某部八连五班班长王万顺同志率领着他的突击组，用手榴弹击溃敌人的抵抗，六分钟冲破障碍，占领了第一个碉堡。该班第二梯子组任国旺同志跟着冲上去，一个人把两人抬的九十多斤重的梯子架起来，我后续部队继续冲上，展开了激烈的攻坚争夺战。昌源河畔炮声震天，白狮岭上硝烟浓罩，尽管敌人的飞机不断的在头上盘旋投弹与扫射，但在我步炮兵英勇的攻击与协同动作下，经过六小时半的激烈战斗，阎匪终于不能挽救他的“金钢岭”的毁灭。守敌阎匪暂三十七师一团三营，随之同归于尽。【太行电】
