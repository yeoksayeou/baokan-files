Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 19th. TASS, Paris, July 14th: The strike of French central government employees is expanding, with employees in various counties of forty provinces already on strike. Representatives of the General Confederation of Labor, the Christian Workers' League, and the "Workers' Force" faction unions passed a joint decision stating: The government's approach is unacceptable and cannot improve the situation of many lower-level employees. The above three unions also urged employees of all government departments to participate in the strike movement and urged all workers to take concerted action. (Note: According to a broadcast on July 13th by Baudé, the Secretary of State responsible for civil affairs, the French government has drafted a general plan for reclassifying the salary grades of government employees, which is scheduled to be implemented on August 15th; before this, the government will partially pay the approved wage increases in the plan, but strikers must return to work before the government's deadline.)

　　法政府雇员罢工扩大
  　四十个省各县雇员已参加罢工总工会等三工会拒绝政府建议
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社巴黎十四日电：法国中央行政机关的罢工在扩大中，四十个省的各县雇员已经罢工。总工会、基督教工人联盟及“工人力量”派工会的三方代表通过联合决定称：政府的办法不能接受，它不能改善许多低级雇员的地位。上述三工会又敦促政府各部雇员均参加罢工运动，并敦促全体工人一致行动（按：据负责民政事务的国务员鲍迪于十三日广播称，法政府已拟定重新划分政府雇员工资等级的总计划，定于八月十五日实施；在此以前，政府将部分支付计划中批准的增资，但罢工者必须在政府的限期以前复工）。
