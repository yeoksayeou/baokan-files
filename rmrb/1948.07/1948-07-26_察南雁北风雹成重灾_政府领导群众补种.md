[Chahar Electric Dispatch] Heavy hail disasters have struck various parts of Southern Chahar. In Wei County, the crops in the mountain areas of the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth districts have suffered considerable losses. According to statistics from nine villages, including Qiangfengya and Caozhuangzi in the thirteenth district, a total of 3,910 mu of beans, buckwheat, hemp, and special crops were lost. In Qiangfengya, losses of special crops accounted for seven-tenths of the village's total, and hemp accounted for four-tenths. All miscellaneous grains in Caozhuangzi were destroyed. Zhuolu's ninth, tenth, thirteenth, and fourteenth districts also suffered hail and flood disasters. In Xuanhua, the first, eleventh, and twelfth districts south of the Sanggan River experienced extremely severe hail disasters. According to preliminary investigations, about 5,000 mu of millet, beans, and sorghum were destroyed in thirty-three villages of varying sizes within an area more than ten li wide and sixty li long. In the east-west Jian villages of the first district alone, more than 2,000 mu were destroyed, accounting for one-half of the total land area. The Sixth Special Commissioner's Office of Northern Yue urgently allocated 1,000 shi of grain to relieve the disaster-stricken people. The Xuanhua County convened county and district cadres to study replanting measures, and dispatched special personnel to purchase a large quantity of buckwheat seeds, which were distributed to the disaster areas with a focus. A group of strong county and district cadres personally went to the disaster villages to organize the masses to rush to replant.

[Another Electric Dispatch] Parts of Western Hebei have suffered hail, flood, and wind disasters. According to extremely incomplete statistics, 98 mu of land in five villages, including Tiejiao in Laishui's fourth district, were washed away on the 3rd. In the third district, 400 mu of land were washed away and 300 mu were silted up. In the Damo Ridge area of Wanping, hail fell for more than an hour on the 29th of last month, and had not completely melted by the 30th, and many crops were smashed. In Huailai's second district, hailstones damaged more than 1,000 mu of seedlings in two villages. Liangxiang suffered a hail disaster on the afternoon of the 3rd, with approximately 3,000 mu affected. In Liujiayu Village, Wanping's second district, a wind disaster on the 30th broke 635 cabbage trees, and crops were also damaged significantly. Many areas in Laishui's seventh district were also badly damaged. The masses in the disaster areas are now actively rushing to replant.

[Northern Yue News] Insect and hail damage are very serious in the First Special District of Northern Yue. Recently, a kind of pest has been discovered in Lingqiu, Fanshi, Hunyuan, and Guangling. They are bright green in color, about seven or eight fen long, and specialize in eating leaves and more tender crops. The affected seedlings wither and die within five to seven days. There are more of these insects on special crops, and the damage is even worse. After this type of insect was discovered in the urban area of Fanshi, 914 people from the surrounding masses were immediately organized, under the leadership of 54 cadres, to catch them, and 563 pests were eliminated in one day. The pests near the urban area have been completely eliminated. Other parts of Northern Yanbei are also actively organizing the masses to capture them.

On June 30th, wind and hail disasters struck six counties including Guangling, Fanshi, Hunyuan, Datong, Yingxian, and Lingqiu. According to preliminary statistics, more than 150 villages were affected, and crops were severely damaged. More than 90% of special crops were destroyed, and there is little hope for most of the autumn crops. Leaders at all levels urgently instructed their subordinates to organize the masses to rush to plant and provide disaster relief, distribute loan grain and relief grain, solve seed difficulties, carry out replanting and alternative planting, and mobilize unaffected villages and households to carry out mutual assistance. After the hail disaster occurred in Hunyuan, the county immediately organized working teams to conduct in-depth investigations in the villages with serious disasters. The government provided 1,500 jin of buckwheat as replanting seeds from loan grain, and loaned 10 million yuan to solve the problem of food and bedding for the masses. Livestock was drawn from unaffected villages and organs to assist the masses in rushing to plant.
