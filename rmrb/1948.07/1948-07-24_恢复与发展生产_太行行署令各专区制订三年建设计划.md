　　Restore and Develop Production
  　Taihang Administrative Office Orders Each Region to Formulate a Three-Year Construction Plan
    [Taihang Telegraph] In order to restore and develop production, the Taihang Administrative Office has formulated a three-year (1949-1951) construction plan for the entire region. On the 5th, it ordered all subordinate regional offices to organize forces, collect materials, and first formulate a plan for the region based on the situation. The order stated: "Based on the CCP Central Committee's 1948 instructions on land reform and party consolidation work, the People's Daily inaugural editorial, and the actual situation in our region, fully restoring and developing production has become the central task for our region in the future. To ensure the realization of this task, it is necessary to formulate a relatively precise, scientific, and long-term production and construction plan as a basis for guiding future work and as a goal to strive for. Now, to make the plan precise, each commissioner must be responsible for organizing a certain force, specifically responsible for convening various forums, collecting and researching materials, supervising and inspecting, and submitting them to the Administrative Office before August 24th. They must also propose opinions on the construction plan based on local conditions. The focus of the collected information includes two major parts: agriculture and industry. The agricultural part includes forests, water conservancy, animal husbandry, transportation, special products, cooperation, household sideline occupations (including textiles), historical conditions, and future construction conditions, etc. The industrial part includes the coal industry, iron industry, porcelain industry, bamboo industry, tool manufacturing industry (iron and wood factories, tool factories), stationery manufacturing industry (pens, ink, slates, slate pencils, chalk, ink, etc.), paper making industry (including Qinyang straw paper), cotton textile industry (including knitting industry), silk weaving industry, wool weaving industry, chemical industry, soap, tooth powder, tanned leather industry, straw hat braiding, saltpeter and sulfur industry, medicine manufacturing, and soil pigment improvement. It is encouraged to study the historical development and current production and management situation, as well as policy implementation. Regarding the production situation, it is necessary to understand the distribution area and production volume, the source of raw materials, the size of capital, the number of workers, technical conditions, the sales area and sales volume, the organizational form of production and sales, and their advantages and disadvantages. Regarding policy implementation, the situation of wrong struggles and correction of deviations, wage and burden policies, the relationship between public and private economies, the relationship between industry and agriculture, what ideological obstacles and production requirements exist between cadres and the masses, workers and capitalists, the economic relationship between the government and trade unions and cooperatives, the division of industrial and commercial areas, and what favorable and unfavorable conditions exist in the future."
