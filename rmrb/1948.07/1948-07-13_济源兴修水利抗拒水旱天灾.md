Taiyue News: Jiyuan adopted the method of work-for-relief to construct water conservancy projects, protecting and expanding over 11,000 mu of irrigated land. Jiyuan frequently suffered from waterlogging and drought disasters in the past, resulting in meager harvests. The Zhulong River had not been repaired in the ten years of rule by the Japanese bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Every year during the rainy season, the river water would surge, flooding much of the crops on both banks. In production and disaster relief, the democratic government used work-for-relief to construct water conservancy projects. First, it distributed over 52,000 jin of wages in the form of rice to the sixteen villages along the Zhulong River, mobilizing disaster victims in each village to dredge the river and remove silt by sections. The masses, upon receiving the wage rice, were in high spirits. Women also actively participated. According to statistics, the masses in the sixteen villages contributed a total of 18,690 workdays, dredging 4,362 zhang of the Zhulong River channel, protecting 5,000 mu of crops on both banks, no longer fearing flooding from the river. Nearby villages also dug 24 canals, diverting water to irrigate more than 4,000 mu of land. The Second District also dug two drainage rivers, rescuing 2,400 mu of flooded land.

　　济源兴修水利抗拒水旱天灾
    【太岳讯】济源采用以工代赈的办法兴修水利，保护与扩大水地一万一千余亩。济源过去经常遭受水旱天灾，收成很薄。珠龙河在日寇蒋匪统治的十年中从未修过，每年雨季河水暴涨，两岸田禾多被淹没。民主政府在生产救灾中，以工代赈兴修水利，先对珠龙河沿河十六个村发出工资米五万二千余斤，动员各村灾民按村分段挑河挖淤。群众领到工米，情绪很高，妇女也积极参加了，统计十六村群众共用工一万八千六百九十个，挑通珠龙河道四千三百六十二丈，保护了两岸五千亩田禾，再不怕河涨淹没。附近各村又挑渠二十四条，引水浇地四千多亩。二区又挑涝河两条，救出水淹地二千四百亩。
