　　Resolve Difficulties of Laborer Families
　　Fourth District Committee of Beiyue Issues Instructions
　　[Beiyue News] The Fourth District Committee of Beiyue recently instructed Party committees and branches at the county, district, and village levels to resolve the practical difficulties of laborers heading out for service, dispel their concerns, and allow them to support the front with peace of mind. It pointed out: (1) The biggest ideological concerns of laborers at present are family production, revising class status, and distributing confiscated property. Districts and villages should be responsible for resolving these issues in a timely and appropriate manner, and assistance should be provided according to the specific difficulties of each family. Those lacking labor should be given help with farming. The number of workdays for helping each departing laborer's family should not exceed 20 workdays per month. (2) All noteworthy happy events resolved for the departing laborers by the village (such as rain after a severe drought, revision of class status, distribution of confiscated property, etc.) should be promptly communicated to the front lines through letters. Districts and counties should also maintain regular contact with the front lines to exchange information, encourage, and offer condolences. (3) Labor support for the front is a regular combat task. Leaders at the county and district levels must strengthen their war consciousness and treat this work with caution. Regular work on people's armed forces should be strengthened, grassroots organizations for laborers should be improved, regular political education should be enhanced, a spirit of long-distance expedition should be cultivated, and the task of supporting the front should be completed. (Fourth Branch)
