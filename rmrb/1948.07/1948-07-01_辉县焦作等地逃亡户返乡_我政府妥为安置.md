[Taihang News] Since the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, especially after correcting various policies, according to statistics from nine counties including Huixian and Xiuwu, 15,364 people who fled to the KMT-controlled areas of northern Henan have returned to their hometowns and, under the resettlement of our democratic government, have successively turned to production and the struggle against the enemy. Among the 473 fugitive households returning from Qi County, Ye County, Hui County, and Jiaozuo, there were 55 landlords and rich peasants. Prior to this, all localities had corrected the "leftist" sentiments among district and village cadres and a small number of the masses who were unwilling to win over the return of fugitive households. Then, they went deep into the KMT-controlled areas, combined with armed attacks, launched political offensives, widely publicized the Outline Land Law, publicized the specific facts of our localities compensating wrongly struggled middle peasants, returning industrial and commercial properties, and resettling landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of their homes. They exposed the enemy's deceptive propaganda, so from March to May, the number of fugitive households returning home gradually increased. They also launched the "five calls" movement, secretly colluding with each other to return home. After Sun Libao, a fugitive household in Nanyang Village, Second District of Qi County, was resettled, he actively went to the KMT-controlled area to collude with eight fugitive households in his village to return home. After Song Xiang, a middle peasant from Mazhuang in the county, fled, a pig from his family was slaughtered and eaten by the district office; this time, after he returned, the district compensated him with a large, fat pig. The government and the people have properly resettled those who returned, helping them to restore and develop production. All localities have successively held forums for fugitive households to conduct policy education, further dispelling their doubts and concerns, and stabilizing their emotions. Some villages in the Sixth District of Qi County also held a get-together (middle and poor peasants), talking to each other and expressing condolences, quickly eliminating barriers. Many villages in Ji County mobilized mass resettlement, and some masses who gained more fruits automatically returned land to compensate wrongly struggled fugitive households. The 84 fugitive households who returned from the Third and Fourth Districts of the county have all been resettled. Qi County corrected the class status of wrongly struggled fugitive households and made compensation. Xinxiang gave wrongly struggled fugitive households land equivalent to that of middle peasants. Huixian stipulated that wrongly struggled middle and poor peasants be given various rights to participate in farmers' associations, militia, and self-defense forces. Land and houses were also appropriately adjusted for landlords and rich peasants, and resettlement was carried out using relief loans and other methods. The masses in Jia Village, Ji County, also helped six fugitive households who returned home plow 68 mu of wasteland with livestock and other means. The government also issued relief grain to solve their production difficulties. Li Tingke, who had been a puppet Bao chief, expressed his determination to correct his past mistakes and is now working hard at ginning cotton and engaging in production, earning more than one dou of rice a day. After Qi Xiaoqun's family, a fugitive household in Pang Village, Qi County, returned, the village government adjusted 21 mu of land to him, allowing him to participate in a mutual aid group and work together. It was also decided to provide loans to help him buy livestock. He excitedly said: "The two sides (referring to our area and the KMT-occupied area) are really two different worlds!" After the masses' lives stabilized, everyone's enthusiasm for fighting against the enemy also increased. Li ××, a fugitive household in Guanzi Village, Qi County, in order to defend his newly established good life, took the initiative to find government staff and requested to participate in armed forces, vowing to fight the KMT bandits to the end under the leadership of the democratic government.

　　辉县焦作等地逃亡户返乡
    我政府妥为安置
    【太行讯】自土地法大纲公布后，特别是端正各种政策以来，据辉县、修武等九个县统计，豫北逃亡蒋区者先后有一万五千三百六十四人还乡，并在我民主政府安置下先后转向生产与对敌斗争。淇县、邺县、辉县、焦作返回的四百七十三个逃亡户中，有地主富农五十五人。事先，各地均改正了区村干部与少数群众中不愿争取逃亡户返乡的左倾情绪，接着深入蒋区，结合武装出击，开展政攻，广泛宣传土地法大纲，宣传我各地补偿错斗中农与退还工商业，以及安置扫地出门的地主富农等具体事实，揭发敌人的欺骗宣传，所以从三月到五月，逃亡户还乡者日渐增多。他们并开展了五叫运动，秘密相互串通返乡。淇县二区南阳村逃亡户孙礼保得到安置后，积极去蒋区串通本村八家逃亡户返乡。该县马庄中农宋祥逃亡后，家里一口猪被区公所杀吃了；这次他回来后，区上赔偿他一口大肥猪。对一般逃亡归来者，我政府与人民均妥为安置，扶助其恢复与发展生产。各地先后召开逃亡户座谈会进行政策教育，进一步解除其怀疑与顾虑，安定其情绪。淇县六区有的村并召开联欢会（中、贫农），彼此谈心，进行慰问，很快消除了隔膜。汲县不少村发动群众性的安置，有些多得果实的群众自动退地补偿错斗逃亡户。该县三、四区返回的八十四户逃亡户，均已得到安置。淇县对错斗逃亡户订正了成份，做了补偿。新乡给错斗逃亡户均安置到相当于中农的土地。辉县规定给予错斗中贫农以参加农会、民兵、自卫队等各种权利，对地主富农亦适当调剂给土地、房屋，并用救济借贷等办法进行了安置。汲县贾庄村群众还以牲口等帮助返乡的六户逃亡户犁荒地六十八亩。政府并发给救济粮，解决其生产中的困难。当过伪保长的李庭科表示坚决改正过去错误，现正努力轧花搞生产，一天能赚一斗多米。淇县庞村逃亡户齐小群全家返回后，村政府调剂给他二十一亩地，让他参加互助组，变工耕种，并决定以贷款扶助买牲口。他激动的说：“两头（指我区与蒋占区）真是两个世界！”群众生活安定后，大家对敌斗争的积极性亦提高。淇县贯子村逃亡户李××为保卫其新建立的好光景，主动找到政府工作人员，要求参加武装，宣誓要在民主政府领导下与蒋匪干到底。
