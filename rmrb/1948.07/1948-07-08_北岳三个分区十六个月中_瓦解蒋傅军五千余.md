[Chahar News] In the past sixteen months, from January of last year to April of this year, the Third, Fifth, and Sixth Sub-districts of the Northern Yue Mountains, combined political offensives with military attacks, widely publicized our army's lenient policy and the policy towards prisoners of war, and strived to disintegrate Chiang and Fu’s bandit troops, with great success. A total of 3,392 enemy regular troops and 2,382 local troops were disintegrated, totaling 5,774 people. Sixteen machine guns, fifteen American-style submachine guns, 428 rifles, twenty-two short guns, 15,335 rounds of ammunition, and one 60mm mortar were seized.
[Chahar News] Liu Lianqi, the brave and resourceful captain of the Fourth District of Yangyuan County, Chahar Province, personally persuaded thirty-two scattered soldiers of Fu’s bandits to surrender to our side, seizing thirty guns. On March 23rd, when our army liberated Yangyuan County, a small group of Fu’s bandit troops, not understanding our policy towards prisoners of war, fled to Xinzhang Village in the Fourth District outside the city to hide. Upon hearing this, Comrade Liu Lianqi immediately rushed to the village, changed into civilian clothes, and went with the village cadres to persuade them. After chatting with them for a while, Comrade Liu said to them: "Why haven't you handed over your guns yet? Can you still leave without handing them over?" The scattered soldiers all said, "We are afraid of being killed if we hand them over." At this time, Comrade Liu explained our army's policy towards prisoners of war, explaining that not only would prisoners not be killed, but they would also be treated preferentially, and those willing to work would stay and work, and those willing to return home would be sent home. The scattered soldiers were still dubious and said: "We want to hand over our guns, but we are afraid of being killed. Without a cadre from above to vouch for us, we won't hand them over." Comrade Liu immediately put on his military cap, took out his pistol, explained that he was a district cadre, and firmly guaranteed that they would not be killed. Twenty-four scattered soldiers immediately handed over their guns. At this time, another villager reported that there were still eight scattered soldiers crawling on the river beach south of the village, and no amount of persuasion would make them hand over their guns. Comrade Liu mobilized the squad leader of the scattered soldiers to persuade them. Before long, all eight scattered soldiers came carrying their guns. In total, thirty-two enemy soldiers were captured this time, and thirty guns were seized.

　　北岳三个分区十六个月中
    瓦解蒋傅军五千余
    【察哈尔讯】北岳三、五、六分区从去年一月到今年四月，以政治攻势配合军事出击，广泛宣传我军宽大政策及俘虏政策，争取瓦解蒋傅匪军，成绩很大。计瓦解敌正规军三三九二人，地方军二三八二人，共五七七四人。缴机枪十六挺，美式冲锋枪十五挺，步枪四二八支，短枪廿二支，子弹一五三三五发，六○炮一门。
    【察哈尔讯】察南阳原县四区大队长刘连起机智勇敢，亲口说服傅匪散兵三十二人向我投诚，缴枪三十支。三月二十三日我军解放阳原县城时，有小股傅匪军因不了解我俘虏政策，逃至城外四区辛杖村潜伏隐蔽。刘连起同志闻讯，立即赶往该村，改穿便衣，随同该村干部前去说服。刘同志和他们说了一阵闲话后，就向他们说：“你们为什么还不缴枪？不缴枪还能走吗？”散兵们都表示“缴了怕杀”。这时刘同志就给他们讲解我军的俘虏政策，说明对俘虏不但不杀，而且还优待，愿工作的留下工作，愿回家的遣送回家。散兵们还是半信半疑的说：“我们想缴枪，就是怕杀，没上边干部作保，我们不缴。”刘同志马上戴上军帽，拿出手枪，说明自己就是区干部，坚决保证不杀他们，当场二十四个散兵都缴了枪。这时又有老乡报告，说村南河滩上还爬着八个散兵，怎样劝说也不缴枪。刘同志动员散兵班长去说服，功夫不大，八个散兵都扛着枪来了。总计这次共俘敌三十二人，缴枪三十支。
