　　[Hebei Central News] The Xin Yuan Iron Factory in the old city of Shulu was founded in June 1946 by six ironworkers. At that time, they were empty-handed, without houses or furniture. Later, with the help of friends, they raised 1 million yuan (border currency, same below) in shares, rented eight rooms in the most remote area, bought some scrap iron, borrowed furniture from colleagues, and made tools such as hammers, anvils, pliers, and benches for the furnace, and began to operate as a partnership. The workers worked hard and diligently, using scrap iron to build a lathe in more than two months. Because the capital was too small, they constantly encountered various difficulties during construction. When they didn't have money to buy iron and coal, they赊 (shē: buy on credit), sold the finished products, and then paid in cash. But everyone never lost heart and continued to work hard. Later, with the support of the bank, they made more than 100 kinds of tools necessary for the factory. By September, the textile industry was active, and there was a great shortage of parts for 풍궁 (punggong: a type of bow-shaped tool) and rolling machines. Merchants from Xinji and Botou came to the factory to order goods, and business slowly began to flourish, further boosting everyone's production enthusiasm. After four months of painstaking operation, at the end of the year, the accounting showed that they had earned a set of factory furniture (worth 5 million yuan), and the workers also received a dividend of 1 million yuan. In the spring of the second year, in order to further expand operations, the workers pooled their dividends and borrowed another 2 million yuan from the Dazhong Bank to buy more than a dozen houses with storefronts on East Street. They also recruited several workers, increasing the total number of workers in the factory to eleven.
    The iron industry operated by the factory was seasonal, with March to July being the slack season. At that time, the factory was in the stage of business development and needed a lot of funds. Therefore, new difficulties arose. By May, the coal and iron raw materials had been used up, and they still owed the bank 10 million yuan, and 3,000 catties of wages and rice could not be paid. The factory and the workers were very worried, and the factory was on the verge of closing down. In order to save the factory, the workers voluntarily requested to be exempted from three months' wages. At that time, the factory appropriately reduced the wages of workers without shares, while all workers with shares were exempted from wages. The entire factory shared weal and woe for three months, and in the autumn and winter seasons, business flourished again. At the end of the year, the net profit was 12 million yuan. At this time, the factory paid the workers five months' wages and rice (100 catties for workers, 60-70 catties for trainees), and the profits were divided equally between labor and capital. The highest-paid worker received 1,280 catties, and the trainees also received 600 catties. This year, the factory has added two new apprentices and made a planer, which can now produce轧花轴 (zhá huā zhóu: ginning shafts) and other small parts. They are now actively preparing to add a casting department. This year is also experiencing a slack season, but the factory is not afraid. With capital and experience, some workers have invested last year's wages into factory re-production, and the Bianqu (Border Region) Bank's business department is also preparing to vigorously support them. Now they have saved a lot of raw materials, and are producing finished products according to the season and the needs of the people, while also mass-producing various 풍궁 (punggong: a type of bow-shaped tool) parts.

### 信源铁工厂是怎样发展起来的？

　　信源铁工厂是怎样发展起来的？
    【冀中讯】束鹿旧城信源铁工厂，是在民国三十五年六月由六个铁业工人创办的。当时他们赤手空拳，房子家具都没有，后来得到朋友的帮助，集了一百万元（边币，下同）的股，在最偏僻的地方租了八间房，收买了一部分废铁，借用同事的家具，制成了烘炉上用的锤、案、钳、班子等工具，开始合伙经营起来。工人们热心的苦干硬干，利用废铁，花费了两个多月的时间，造成了一架旋床。本钱太小，在建设当中不断遇到各种困难。买铁买煤没有钱，就凭着信用先赊了来，卖出成品再交付现款。但是大家从不灰心，仍继续努力。后来得到了银号的扶植，制成了工厂所必需的一百多种工具。到了九月，纺织业活跃了，风弓轧车的零件非常缺，辛集、泊头的商人都到工厂来订货，生意才慢慢烘火起来，大家生产热情更高了。经过四个月的苦心经营，到年底结帐时，赚了一套工厂的家具（合五百万元），工人们还批了一百万的红利。第二年春天，工人们为了更进一步的扩大经营，把分得的红利集结起来，又从大众银号贷款二百万元，在东大街上买了十多间有门面的房子，又招收了几个工人，全厂增加到十一个人。
    工厂经营的铁业带有季节性，每年三月到七月是淡月；当时工厂正处在经营发展的阶段，需用大量的资金；于是产生了新的困难，到了五月，煤铁原料已经用完，还欠下银号一千万元，工资米三千斤无法偿付。厂方和工人都很着急，眼看着工厂要倒闭了。工人为了挽救工厂，自动要求免除三个月的工资。当时厂方对没有股金的工人，适当的减低了工资，有股金的工人则全部免除了工资。全厂患难与共三个月，到了秋冬两季，生意又烘火起来。年底结帐，净赚一千二百万元。厂方这时补发给工人五个月的工资米（工人百斤，学员六、七十斤），并将盈利按劳资折半分红，最高的工人批了一千二百八十斤，学员也分得了六百斤。今年该厂又新添了两个学徒，制成了一架刨床，已可出产轧花轴及其他小的机件。现在正积极筹备添设翻砂部。今年同样有淡月，但是工厂不怕了，有了资本，有了经验，有些工人把去年的工资投入工厂再生产，边区银行营业部也准备大力的扶植他们。现在他们存下了不少的原料，一面根据季节和人民的需要出产成品，一面在大量的赶制各种风弓零件。
