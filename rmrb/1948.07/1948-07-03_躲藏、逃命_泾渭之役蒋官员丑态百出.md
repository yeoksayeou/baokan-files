Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th -- During the Northwest People's Liberation Army's advance into the Jingwei region of central Shaanxi in late April, the local Chiang Kai-shek officials were panicked and behaved deplorably. Jin Bingjia, the Kuomintang magistrate of Gouyi County, was ridiculed by the local people as "Chief Jin Bao" because his "government orders" did not extend beyond two miles outside the city. On April 17th, when we attacked Gouyi, "Chief Jin Bao" hid in the seven-story high tower in the east of the city. After our artillery fire broke the staircase in the middle of the tower, "Chief Jin Bao" begged our army to rescue him from the tower. When our soldiers brought a ladder to call him down, the obese "Chief Jin Bao" was so frightened that his legs went weak and he was unable to descend. Our soldiers had to climb the tower and use ropes to lower him down. On April 18th, after our army annihilated the Third Regiment of the Youth Army 203rd Division in Changning Town, Yongshou, Li Tongde, the Kuomintang magistrate of Yongshou, hastily led more than a hundred people to abandon the city and flee for their lives, only to be completely annihilated by our army in Diantou Town, southwest of the county, on the 21st. Wang Xu, the magistrate of Fufeng County, had already tightly closed the city gates before our army arrived. On April 21st, when our army arrived, Wang and his subordinates fled for their lives. Wang Zhonghe, a section chief who hadn't even put on his clothes properly, was captured alive by our army as soon as he jumped off the city wall. The soldiers asked him, "Where is the magistrate?" He said, "I didn't see him. Everyone is escaping on their own, no one can take care of anyone else." A certain magistrate Lan of Qishan County fled outside the city before our army arrived. On the night of April 23rd, it rained, and they thought our army would not come, so they sent a part of the security police team back to the city to guard it. But as soon as our army arrived, the security police team abandoned the city and fled without firing a single shot. Under the shock of our army's offensive, Shu Yaojiang, the magistrate of Chongxin County, forcibly pulled more than ten head of livestock and first sent his wife, children, and plundered property to Pingliang. His finance section chief, Xu, and others followed suit and moved their families one after another. Coincidentally, the People's Liberation Army did not go there for the next few days, so they thought, "Our small county is not on a major road, so they probably won't come." But on the night of May 3rd, when a part of the People's Liberation Army passed through the city, they immediately abandoned the city and fled west overnight. Before the liberation of Baoji, Chiang's personnel were transporting their families and personal belongings to Hanzhong day and night. Commissioner Sun Zongfu had already fled before our army arrived.

　　躲藏、逃命　泾渭之役蒋官员丑态百出
    【新华社西北三十日电】西北人民解放军于四月底挺进陕中泾渭地区作战，该地蒋方官员惊慌万状，丑态百出。蒋记枸邑县长金炳嘉，因其“政令”不出城郊二里，当地群众讥称他为“金保长”。四月十七日我攻枸邑时，“金保长”躲在城东七层高塔上，恰在该塔中层楼梯被我炮兵击断后，“金保长”乃乞求我军援救下塔。我军战士找了梯子前去叫他下来时，肥胖的“金保长”吓的两腿酸软，无力下梯，经我军战士上塔才用绳子将他吊下来。四月十八日我军在永寿常宁镇消灭青年军二○三师第三团后，永寿蒋记县长李同德急率百余人弃城逃命，二十一日被我军在该县西南之店头镇全部消灭。扶风县长王绪于我军到达前即紧闭城门，四月二十一日我军到达后，王及其僚属即各自逃命。衣服都没有穿好的科长王忠和，刚刚跳下城墙，即为我军活捉，战士们问他：“县长在哪里？”他说：“没有见到，各人逃各人的，谁也顾不了谁。”岐山县长兰某在我军到达前即逃往城外。四月二十三日夜雨，他们以为我军不会来，又派一部保警队回城看守。但我军一到，保警队一枪未发，即弃城逃命。崇信县长舒耀江在我军攻势震惊下，强拉牲口十余头，首先将其老婆孩子及搜刮而来的财物送往平凉，其财政科长徐某等亦上行下效，相继搬家。恰巧以后几天，解放军并未去那里，他们即以为：“咱们小县，不通大路，大概不会来了。”但五月三日夜解放军一部路过该城时，他们立即连夜弃城西逃。宝鸡解放前，蒋方人员日夜迁运家眷及私人财物到汉中，专员孙宗复在我军到达前即已逃走。
