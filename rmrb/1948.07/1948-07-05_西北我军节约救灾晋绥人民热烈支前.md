Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd. Under the call of the Northwest Field Army Frontline Headquarters and Political Department, the Northwest Liberation Army units have enthusiastically launched a disaster relief campaign to conserve two liang of wheat per person per day. The movement is tentatively scheduled for one month. The conserved grain will be transported to the disaster area as quickly as possible. The political department of a certain unit said in its instructions on conserving and providing disaster relief: Our past victories have relied on the active support of the border area people; and the future will remain the same. "The border area is our home, and the hunger and famine of the border area people is our hunger and famine." In addition to responding to the call, some troops have also taken the time to cultivate wasteland and plant vegetables in order to conserve more grain for disaster relief.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 1st. The people of Jiaocheng, Wenshui, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Qingyuan, Yangqu, Linxian, Lishi, Zhongyang and other counties enthusiastically support the Jinzhong Frontline Liberation War. As soon as the mobilization orders for participation in the war were issued in various counties, the militia and the masses responded enthusiastically. In Baijiashan Village, Fourth District, Lishi, the original plan was for only 30 people to participate in the war, but before the official notice was even issued, more than 80 people had already signed up. When Yan Shouen, a 50-year-old poor peasant in the village, learned of the news, his son had gone to a relative's house. Fearing that his son would be late in returning home and would not be able to participate, he instructed his wife to prepare clothes earlier and personally ran to find his son to sign him up. Liu Rongkui from Xiaduanduan Village was ginning cotton in Liulin when he heard the news about participating in the war. He ran 50 li overnight to return home to sign up; but his younger brother, Liu Yaokui, had already signed up first. The two then argued over who would go, and unable to resolve the matter, they both went in the end. Women and children in various places also actively participated in supporting the frontline work. Women in Yanjia Mountain and other villages in Linxian voluntarily made bullet bags, grenade bags, and rice bags for the militia participating in the war. As the militia did not have gun oil, the women in the village ground up the apricot kernels they had accumulated over the years, boiled them into oil, and sent them to the militia participating in the war. Women in Xiaoyi made a large number of military shoes to comfort the troops, and many women voluntarily went to the hospital to care for the wounded. Children in Yezihe, Jiaocheng, and other places collectively went up the mountains to collect firewood for the troops to burn. The militia and laborers participating in the war were very welcome by the masses along the way. For example, when the militia participating in the war from the Fourth District of Lishi passed through Xishuba Village, dozens of nearby villages jointly offered comfort. The Women's Committee and the Mao Zedong Youth League of Dawu Village donated eggs and cigarettes to comfort the militia participating in the war, and wrote a warm letter of condolence, which said: "We personally made many flowers and sent them to you to wear, so that everyone knows the glory of your participation in the war. We hope that when you brothers arrive at the front, you will support the troops, win more victories, and liberate our fathers, brothers, sisters, and elders in the Jinzhong Plain as soon as possible. We must produce well to support the frontline; and we guarantee that your families will not feel any difficulties." Note: When the people of all regions are enthusiastically supporting the frontline, the frontline troops and the rear mobilization and service organs must use civilian labor very sparingly. Mobilization should be limited, and surplus laborers and coolies should be returned. Only by constantly paying attention to saving civilian labor can we maintain a high degree of popular enthusiasm for participation in the war. Otherwise, this enthusiasm will decline one day.

　　西北我军节约救灾晋绥人民热烈支前
    【新华社西北二日电】在西北野战军前线司令部、政治部号召下，西北解放军各部已热烈展开每人每日节约麦子二两的救灾运动。该运动暂定期为一个月。节约之粮食将以最快方法运到灾区。某部政治部在节约救灾的指示中说：我军过去的胜利，是依靠边区人民的积极支援；今后也仍然如此。“边区是我们的家，边区人民的饥饿灾荒，就是我们的饥饿灾荒。”有些部队除响应号召外，并抽空开荒种菜，以便能更多节约粮食救灾。
    【新华社晋绥一日电】交城、文水、汾阳、孝义、清源、阳曲、临县、离石、中阳等县人民热烈支援晋中前线解放战争。各县参战动员令刚一发出，民兵、群众即纷纷热烈响应。离石四区白家山村，原只计划三十人参战，但正式通知还未发出，报名参战者已达八十余人。该村五十多岁的贫农严守恩知道参战消息时，他的儿子正到亲戚家去了，他怕儿子回家迟了，轮不上参加，即一面吩咐婆姨早些准备衣裳，一面亲自跑去找儿回家报名。下段段村的刘荣奎正在柳林弹棉花，听到参战消息，连夜跑了五十里路赶回家报名；但他弟弟刘耀奎已先报了名，于是两人争着要去，不得解决，最后是两人都去了。各地妇女儿童也积极参加支援前线的工作。临县阎家山等村妇女，自动为参战民兵赶制子弹袋、手榴弹袋、米袋。民兵没有擦枪油，该村妇女即将历年积蓄下的杏仁子，磨碎熬成油，送给参战民兵。孝义妇女做好大批军鞋慰劳军队，许多妇女自动到医院看护伤员；交城野子河等地儿童则集体上山打柴，供部队烧用。参战民兵民工甚受沿途群众欢迎，如离石四区参战民兵，路经西属巴村时，附近数十村庄联合慰劳。大武村的妇女委员会及毛泽东青年团，捐出鸡蛋、纸烟慰劳参战民兵，并写了一封热烈的慰问信，信中说：“我们亲手做了许多花，送你们戴上，让人人都知道你们参战的光荣。希望兄弟们到了前方，支援部队，多打胜仗，早日解放咱们晋中平川的父老兄弟姐妹们。我们一定要好好生产，支援前线；并保证你们家中不会感到困难”。按：当各地人民踊跃地支援前线的时候，前方部队及后方动员机关与勤务机关，必须十分节省地使用民力。动员应有限度，超出需要的民工民夫应该退回。只有经常注意节省民力，才能经常保持人民参战的高度积极性。否则，这积极性就会有低落的一天。
