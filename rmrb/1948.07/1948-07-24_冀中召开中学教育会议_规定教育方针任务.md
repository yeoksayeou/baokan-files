　　Jizhong Convenes Middle School Education Conference
　　Stipulates Educational Guidelines and Tasks
　　[Jizhong News] The Jizhong Administrative Office convened a middle school education conference, which concluded on June 24th. The conference reviewed past educational work and discussed future middle school education guidelines, school systems, curriculum standards, and other issues. Currently, Jizhong has five middle schools with 2,477 male and female students. Over the past decade, middle schools and equivalent training classes run by agencies above the district level alone have trained over 15,000 cadres of various types. During the war, there was an urgent need for a large number of cadres, and students were recruited and transferred at any time, with the longest study period being no more than a year and a half. Therefore, it was difficult to achieve the goal of cultivating a certain level of cultural literacy and scientific knowledge. In his concluding remarks, Liu @, Director of the Education Department of the Administrative Office, pointed out that in the past, middle school education had to adopt short-term training courses to meet the needs of the war. Currently, based on the development of the North China situation, under the principle of necessary and possible construction, some wartime facilities should be changed and gradually move towards regularization. The current guideline for middle school education should be to cultivate young people with a certain level of cultural literacy and scientific knowledge, who can participate in various construction tasks after a certain amount of professional training. The nature of middle school education is general education, and its task is to improve culture, with cultural education as the primary focus. The school system is temporarily set at three years, and no easy transfer is allowed if the semester is not completed; in order to meet the current needs of work, each middle school is still allowed to run short-term classes at the same time, with a minimum study period of one year. Enrollment requires a primary school graduation or equivalent education, and the entrance examination must be strict. Graduation is only allowed after passing the examination after three years of study. Each middle school is directly managed by the Administrative Office. All matters related to changes in educational plans, school administration, the appointment and removal of main cadres and teachers, and the assignment of students after graduation are directly decided by the Administrative Office. Each special district has the responsibility to supervise the specific implementation of the school.

　　冀中召开中学教育会议
  　规定教育方针任务
    【冀中讯】冀中行署召开的中学教育会议，于六月二十四日结束。会上检讨了过去的教育工作，讨论了今后中学教育方针、学制、课程标准等问题。目前冀中共有五个中学，男女学生二四七七人。十年来，仅分区以上机关主办的中学及相当中学的训练班，培养各种干部一万五千余人。战时迫切需要大量干部，学生随招随调，学习时间最长的不过一年半，因此很难达到培养一定文化程度和科学知识的目的。作结论时，行署教育厅柳＠厅长指出：过去中学教育为了适应战争需要，不得不采取短期训练班的办法。目前根据华北形势的发展，在必要和可能建设的方针下，应改变过去某些战时设施，逐渐走向正规化。目前中学教育的方针，应为培养有一定文化程度和科学知识的青年，毕业后经过一定的专业训练，即能参加各项建设工作。中学教育的性质是普通教育，其任务在于提高文化，应以文化教育为主。学制暂定为三年，凡学期未满不准轻易调动；为解决目前工作之需要，仍允各中学同时开办短期班，学习时间最少一年。入学程度必须具有高小毕业或同等学力者，入学考试必须严格，修学三年考试及格始得毕业。各中学由行署直接管理，凡有关改变教育计划、学校行政、主要干部及教员的任免，以及学生毕业后分配工作等，统由行署直接决定。各专署有督导学校具体执行之责。
