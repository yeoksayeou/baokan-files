Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. TASS reports: The Soviet laboring people are expressing outrage at the heinous crime of murdering Togliatti, the leader of all Italian working people. Moscow newspapers have published letters from Soviet scientists Vavilov, writers Simonov and Sholokhov, workers from the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, and farmers from collective farms across the country, all denouncing the evil acts of the fascist elements. Izvestia, under the large headline "The Soviet People Hate the Evil Scheme of Human Devils Against Togliatti's Life; the Poisonous Arrows of the Bandit Party Cannot Curb the Growth of World Democratic Forces," published many letters from Soviet men and women. Pravda devoted the entire second page to publishing the indignant reactions of the laboring people. In dozens of towns in Romania, mass rallies of laboring people were held to protest the attempt to murder Togliatti. The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Trade Union and the Presidium of the Czechoslovak National Assembly sent telegrams to Togliatti to express their condolences and hoped for his speedy recovery.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. TASS reports: The American Communist Party telegraphed Italian Communist leader Togliatti on the 15th, stating, "The responsibility for the conspiracy to assassinate you lies not only with the fascist who fired the shot. This heinous act is also the result of the US imperialists' policy of interfering in Italian internal affairs and cultivating the revival of fascist forces through its servant, the Gasperi government and the reactionary elements of the Church. The American Communist Party will redouble its efforts to mobilize the American people to oppose the policies of US imperialism."

    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社报导：苏联劳动人民正对谋害意大利全体劳动人民领袖托格里亚蒂的邪恶罪行表示愤慨。莫斯科各报均刊登苏联科学家瓦维洛夫，作家西蒙诺夫、萧洛霍夫等，莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂、斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂等厂职工及各地集体农场农民痛斥法西斯分子之邪恶行为的信件。消息报在“苏维埃人民憎恨人类魔鬼对托格里亚蒂生命的邪恶图谋，匪党恶毒暗箭不能遏止世界民主力量的成长”的大标题下，发表许多苏联男女的来信。真理报以第二版整版篇幅刊登劳动人民愤慨的反应。罗马尼亚的数十处城镇，均举行劳动人民的集会，抗议谋害托格里亚蒂的企图。捷克职工会中央委员会及捷克国民议会主席团，均致电慰问托格里亚蒂，并盼其早日康复。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社报导：美国共产党于十五日致电意共领袖托格里亚蒂称，“阴谋暗杀你的责任，不仅在于开枪的法西斯分子。这一罪恶行动，也是美帝国主义者干涉意大利内政的政策，并通过其仆从——加斯贝利政府和教会反动派培养复活的法西斯主义势力的结果。美国共产党将加倍努力，以动员美国人民来反对美帝国主义的政策。”
