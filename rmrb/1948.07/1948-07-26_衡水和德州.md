　　Hengshui and Dezhou
    [Shijiazhuang News] This reporter recently visited Hengshui City and Dezhou City. I arrived in Hengshui on the 9th, just in time for market day. The West Gate was very lively.

    Hengshui's industry and commerce had a "leftist" deviation during the land reform last year. Seventy-four businesses were struggled against because they were related to the exploitation of landlords, rich peasants, and feudal elements in the countryside (some only had individual shareholders who were struggled against). In order to implement the policy of resolutely protecting industry and commerce, the county government re-investigated from the end of May. Among them, those that should not have been confiscated were returned after persuading the masses. Forty-one households have now been returned, with very detailed procedures. The items to be returned were discussed in advance, and then a meeting of the business owners, shareholders, and managers was convened. Representatives elected by the masses explained in detail, government cadres participated, and documents after the struggle were burned on the spot, hoping that the original owners would work hard to run the business. Jia Fusen, a representative of the poor people's association in Hexi Street, said when returning the Jujihao grocery store: "We respond to Chairman Mao's call to resolutely protect industry and commerce. Take it back and work hard!" The manager of the store was also very happy and said: "The army is fighting old Chiang at the front, and we will run industry and commerce well in the rear." The returned businesses resumed operation as usual, and Hengshui City's industry and commerce completely returned to normal and became increasingly prosperous. By the end of May, there were 639 industrial and commercial households, with 1,858 employees.

    When I arrived in Dezhou City, it was another scene. Boats were parked on the canal in the west of the city. Some boats were more than ten yards long and could carry 200,000 catties. The bedrooms and kitchens in the boats were very exquisite. Three rows of small boats continuously crossed the pedestrians and vehicles. On the streets of Dezhou City, newly hung plaques and bright doors and windows of shops were everywhere. There are two situations for newly opened shops: industrial and commercial households who were struggled against in last year's land reform are now being returned (83 out of 113 households have been returned to their original owners). Inside and outside the South Gate, there are more than 20 connected shops that were all built and opened since the beginning of this spring. Various red and green congratulatory plaques for "New Opening Celebration" are still hung with colored silk. The Huabei Shoe and Hat Shop, right outside the city gate, only opened on the 21st of the fourth lunar month. At the beginning, it could sell 40,000 to 50,000 North Sea currency per day, but now it sells 120,000 to 130,000 per day (the exchange rate between North currency and Border currency is one to ten). Shopkeeper Li said that he is planning to expand his current bedroom into a storefront and build another bedroom in the back. When asked about the construction of this row of new houses, he said: "When the city was liberated two years ago, the enemy in the city—the Kuomintang vanguard army reorganized from Wang Jixiang's unit of puppet troops—burned the houses of civilians and merchants at the base of the city wall for fear that the People's Liberation Army would enter the city. These are only being built now."

    Dezhou City was originally a commercial center for water and land transportation. Now, there are more than 1,600 businesses in 69 industries. Among them, there are 53 industrial enterprises such as textiles and iron, and four private silver firms. The freight business is particularly developed, and recently some merchants from the Chiang area have invested in operations. During the commemoration of "July 7th," just when the wrongly struggled industrial and commercial enterprises were being returned, the merchants and residents of Dezhou City hung lanterns and decorations, which was very lively.

　　衡水和德州
    【石家庄讯】记者日前到衡水城和德州市观光。九号到衡水，正逢集日。西关很热闹。
    衡水工商业，去年土改中有“左”的偏向，曾有七十四家因与乡村地富封建剥削有关的商号被斗（有的只个别股东被斗）。县政府为了执行坚决保护工商业的政策，从五月下旬起，重新调查，其中不该没收的，说服群众退还，现已退还四十一户，手续很细致。应退的东西事前讨论好，再召集该商户股东、经理开会，由群众推出的代表详细交代，政府干部参加，当场焚烧斗争后的文件，希望原主努力经营。河西街贫民团代表贾福森在退还聚记号杂货铺的时候说：“我们响应毛主席的号召，坚决保护工商业，退给你们安心干吧！”该号经理也很高兴说：“军队在前方打老蒋，咱们在后方好好办工商业。”退还的商业照常经营起来了，衡水城工商业完全恢复了常态，日益繁荣。五月底，工商户达六百卅九户，从业人数一千八百五十八人。
    到德州市时，又是一番风光。城西的运河上停泊着船只。有的船长十余丈，能载二十万斤。船中卧室，厨房十分精致。三列并排的小船不停地横渡行人和车辆。德州市大街上，挂着崭新牌匾和门窗鲜亮的店铺到处可见。新开张的店铺有两种情况：去年土改中被斗争的工商户，最近正在发还（一百一十三家中已有八十三家交还给原来东家），在南门的里面和外面，有二十余家相连的店铺都是从今年开春修盖开张的，各式各样“新张之喜”的红绿贺匾上还挂着彩绸。紧靠城门外的华北鞋帽店，阴历四月二十一才开张，两间门面，刚开始每天能卖北海币四、五万，现在每天卖十二、三万（北币与边币兑率为一比十）。李掌柜说他正打算把现在的一间卧室也扩为门面，在后面另盖卧室。问到这一排新房子修盖的情况，他说：“在前年解放时，城里的敌人——伪军王吉祥部改编的国民党先遣军怕解放军入城，把城根的民商房屋都烧了，现在才盖起来的。”
    德市原为一水旱码头商业中心。现在，六十九种行业已有一千六百余家。其中纺织，铁业等工业有五十三家，私营银号四家。货栈业特别发达，最近并有一些从蒋区来的商人投资经营。在纪念“七七”时，正值发还错斗工商业的时候，德市商民悬灯结彩，热闹异常。
