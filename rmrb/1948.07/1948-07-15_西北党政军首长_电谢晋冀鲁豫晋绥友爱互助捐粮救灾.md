Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th: Northwest Party, government, and military leaders Chairman Lin Boqu, Commander He Long, and Secretary Xi Zhongxun recently sent a telegram to former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Party, government, and military leaders Bo Yibo, Xu Xiangqian, Teng Daiyuan, Yang Xiufeng, and Jin-Sui Border Region Party, government, and military leaders Li Jingquan, Zhou Shidi, and Wu Xinyu, expressing gratitude for the great revolutionary friendship shown by the two regions in donating and transporting over 60,000 *da shi* of grain last winter and spring to aid the famine in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The telegram stated in part: "The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region suffered devastation from the Chiang-Hu bandit troops and natural disasters last year, leaving hundreds of thousands of people in famine. We are grateful for your enthusiastic donation of grain and for organizing tens of thousands of people who, braving hardships and fatigue, worked day and night in severe winter rain and snow, handling and completing the transportation of over 60,000 *da shi* of grain in a satisfactory manner in two months. This not only rescued the disaster-stricken people in the border region and enabled them to return to production, but also powerfully shook the Northwest revolutionary war. The people of the border region will never forget this spirit of serving the people with sincerity and revolutionary friendship. In addition to extending our deep gratitude to you on behalf of all the soldiers and civilians in the border region, we will work even harder to thoroughly eliminate the Chiang-Hu bandit troops and liberate the Great Northwest."
