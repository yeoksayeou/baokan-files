　　Check Mutual Aid, Promote Good Experiences
  　Production at the Baojiajiao Base Point Gains Momentum
    [Taihang News] Recently, the Baojiajiao base point in the Second District of Licheng checked the mutual aid in various villages, promoted good practices, corrected bad practices, and made progress in mutual aid production. In the past, Gao Bancao's group in this village only looked at the size of people when assigning work points, and did not consider the quality of work, which was very unfair. Some people worked quickly and well, while others did not work well, but both received ten work points per day, which dissatisfied the skilled workers. Two oxen plowing land for one day were calculated as three mu, earning 12.5 jin of fodder and 72 jin of grass, with labor costs separate; but two good donkeys delivering manure for one day could only earn 8.12 jin of rice, also without grass (and labor costs separate). The mutual aid group determined that oxen should only plow the land and donkeys should only deliver manure. Generally, donkeys were stronger than oxen in this village, so the households raising donkeys were very dissatisfied. Liu Qingren's group's method was the opposite: labor points were assigned according to the quality and speed of work each day, with good and fast workers receiving more points, and bad and slow workers receiving fewer points; livestock points were assigned with oxen plowing land earning 15 points per day, and delivering manure earning 12 points (because oxen were more suitable for plowing land), and donkeys earning 15 points per day for both plowing and delivering manure (because donkeys did both well), and points were assigned flexibly according to the quality and speed of the livestock. In this way, the whole group was satisfied and production was very energetic. After inspection, Baojiajiao village found that there were three problems hindering mutual aid: first, the work accounts from the previous two years had not been settled; second, good and bad laborers were all assigned ten points per day; and third, there were conflicts among cadres: in one group, there were four main cadres, including the branch secretary, village head, militia committee director, and instructor, as well as a former farmers' association chairman, who not only did not actively lead and promote the group, but often caused friction, which affected the entire group and made it worse and worse. The problem in Yushuping village was that they only made calls to action but did not inspect: some time ago, when they called for sowing, a man named Xing Tianxi planted millet without plowing the land because he was afraid of paying the mutual aid equivalent of rice. The cadres did not inspect and praised him greatly that night, saying that he responded to the call and sowed early, and was active in production. The masses were very dissatisfied when they heard this, saying, "The higher-ups called for deep plowing and careful cultivation, but he didn't even plow the land. If that's the case, we can plow earlier than him." Therefore, even criticism and praise had no effect in this village. Songjiazhuang, Hong＠he and other villages only made calls to action but did not make plans and produced blindly; Yan'jing village did not praise good examples or summarize and promote good methods, causing production to fall into spontaneous flow. After the inspection, everyone discussed and decided to use good examples and good methods to promote everyone, and each cadre should lead a good group in production, make short-term plans regularly, check on time, praise achievements in time, and summarize and promote good experiences. Baojiajiao village promoted Liu Qingren's group's method of assigning points according to work, and changed to assigning work flexibly according to fixed points, which quickly improved production enthusiasm. It was originally planned to weed the corn in eight days (each person weeding six points per day), but it was completed in seven days. Wang Jinfa's group originally planned to complete seedling pulling in five days, but because they absorbed three children and five women, and started early and ate breakfast in the fields, each laborer pulled an average of one more point per day, and it was completed in four days. The auxiliary labor of Gao Bancao's group was also paid according to the work, and some women did not rest at noon to prepare dinner in order to do more work. Men went to the fields early in the morning, and women prepared meals and brought them to the fields, so that each person did an average of two more work points per day. The village also paid attention to cultivating women and children: when going to the fields, they first showed them how to do it, let them learn, and then checked after they were done, pointed out the shortcomings, and corrected them immediately. The whole village absorbed twenty-seven women and twenty-two children to participate in seedling pulling, and the women were able to do the same amount of work as full laborers, saving a lot of male labor. Wang Jinfa's group has already extracted two people to open an oil mill, preparing to topdress the corn of the whole group.

　　检查互助发扬好经验
  　暴家脚基点生产有了劲
    【太行讯】黎城二区暴家脚基点最近检查各村互助，发扬好的做法，改正坏的做法，互助生产有了进步。该村高半曹组以前订分光看人的个子大小，不看做活好坏，订的很不公道。有些人做活又快又好，有些人做得很不好，都是每天十分工，好把式都不满意。两头牛耕一天地，按三亩计算，可赚料十二斤半，赚草七十二斤，人工在外；但两头好驴送一天粪只能赚八斤十二两米，还不管草（人工也在外）。互助组确定牛驴分工：牛光耕地，驴光送粪。该村一般是驴比牛强，所以喂驴户很不满意。刘清任组的办法和这些相反：劳力订分，是按每天做活好坏快慢来订，好的快的多订，坏的慢的少订；牲口订分，牛耕地一天十五分，送粪十二分（因牛适于耕地），驴耕地送粪每天都是十五分（因驴两样都干得好），并按牲口好坏快慢死分活计。这样全组都满意，生产很有劲。暴家脚村经过检查，发现有三种问题障碍互助：一是前二年工帐没算清，二是好坏劳力每天一律订十分，三是干部闹矛盾：有一个组里就有支书、村长、武委会主任、指导员等四个主要干部，和一个旧农会主席，在组里不仅不积极领导推动，反而时常闹磨擦，影响整个组越闹越坏。榆树坪村生产上的毛病是光号召，不检查：前些时号召下种，有一个叫邢天喜的，因怕出互助等价米，没耕地就把谷子硬种上了。干部没检查，当晚就大大表扬一顿，说他响应号召，提前下种，生产积极。群众听到非常不满，说“上级叫深耕细作，他连耕也不耕，要这样，咱比他耕能早。”因此该村连批评表扬都不起作用。宋家庄、洪＠河等村是光号召，不做计划，盲目生产；岩井村是有好榜样不表扬，有好办法不总结推广，使生产陷于自流。检查以后，大家讨论确定要用好的例子、好的办法推动大家，每个干部在生产中要领导好一个小组，经常做短期计划，按时检查，有成绩及时表扬，总结推广好的经验。暴家脚村发扬刘清任组按活订分的办法，都改成死分活订，生产情绪很快提高了。玉茭原计划八天锄完（每人每天锄六分），结果七天就锄完了。王金法组原计划五天完成拔苗，因为吸收了三个儿童、五个妇女，又起早吃饭上地，每个劳力一天平均多拔一分，四天就拔完了。高半曹组的辅助劳力也按活计工，有些妇女为了多做活，午间不休息就做好夜饭。男人起早上地，妇女做好饭，去地时把饭捎上，这样每人一天平均多做二分工。该村并注意培养妇女儿童：上地时先给她们做个样子，让她们学着做，做罢就检查，指出缺点，马上改正。全村吸收了二十七个妇女和二十二个儿童参加拔苗，妇女都能顶全劳力，省了不少男工。王金法组已抽出二人开油坊，准备全组玉茭的追肥。
