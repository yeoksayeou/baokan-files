　　Flood Control News in Brief
  　Neihuang Xiao River Dredging Completed
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Dispatch] The Neihuang County Xiao River dredging project was completed on the 7th. The Xiao River in the county is 55 *li* long, stretching from the southwest of the city to Dongyongjian. There was originally a 24-*li* long canal, which had not been dredged for many years, preventing the water from flowing smoothly, and causing the crops along the river to be flooded year after year. Before the start of this project, thorough mobilization was carried out, and specific tasks were assigned, stipulating that whoever completed their task first could return home first. Many people worked day and night, and most villages completed their tasks ahead of schedule. The original plan for the entire county project required 200,932 cubic *fang* of earth, mobilizing 14,015 full laborers, averaging 15 *fang* of earth per person. However, after specific task assignments, each village wanted to complete their task as soon as possible, so they automatically added people, and each person only moved an average of 5.3 *fang* of earth upon completion.
    Hutuo River Flood Control Mostly Prepared
    [Ji-Zhong Dispatch] The Hutuo River Flood Control Headquarters, jointly composed of representatives from the Ji-Zhong Public Works Bureau, the Ninth Special Prefecture, and Raoyang, Anping, Xianxian and other counties, was officially established on July 7.

The cadres leading the flood control work have all gone to the dikes.

　　防汛零讯
  　内黄硝河疏浚完工
    【冀鲁豫电】内黄县硝河疏浚工程于七日竣工。该县境内硝河长达五十五里，自城西南到东永建，原有二十四里长的水渠一道，多年未经疏浚，渠水不能畅流，靠河庄稼连年遭受水淹。此次动工之前，首先作了深入的动员，并具体分工，规定谁先完工谁先回家。许多群众日夜加工，大部村庄都提前完成任务。全县工程原计划需要二十万零九千三百三十二方土，发动整劳力一万四千零十五人，每人合十五方土。但经具体分工后，各村都想争取早日完工，因此都自动添人，每人竣工时只合五点三方土。
