A Small Story of Our Army's Mass Discipline in Jinzhong
Ai Chun

The wheat in Jinzhong was turning yellow, and the people under Yan Xishan's rule saw that the ripe wheat would soon be out of their reach. At this time, a large contingent of the People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared in the vast plains of Jinzhong. A certain unit was assigned to stay in Xujiazhuang, Gaobei, Second District, Qixian County, which had just been liberated.

On June 19th, the unit received orders from its superiors to depart. Comrades living in the west of the village were boarding up doors, sweeping courtyards, tidying up houses, and returning borrowed items to the people, explaining everything clearly to the masses. Then, they gathered the troops and set off.

The orderly ranks had just reached the edge of the village when they heard someone chasing after them, crying and shouting. Everyone thought something had happened and stood there stunned. It turned out that the person chasing them was the old landlord in whose house the unit had stayed. The instructor hurried forward to inquire. "You took more than a foot of my foreign cloth..." the old man stammered, crying as he spoke. The instructor said, "Don't cry, fellow villager. If we took it, we guarantee it won't disappear. Sit down, and I'll ask around." So he immediately ordered the row of people who had stayed in the old man's house to stop, and one by one, they opened their clothes and backpacks, allowing the old man to personally inspect them. At this time, it started to rain. Seeing that the foreign cloth could not be found, the old man helplessly said, "Don't check anymore, you hurry up and leave!" The instructor and the soldiers thought to themselves, this is really strange, how could such a thing happen? The disciplinary education of "not taking a single needle or thread from the masses" comrades would not forget! Everyone was uneasy, feeling that this matter concerned the reputation of the People's Liberation Army, and they were all willing to get to the bottom of it. The instructor first ordered the troops to leave, and then said to the old man, "Fellow villager! Let's go back to your house and search carefully. If we can't find it, we'll compensate you at the price!" Saying that, the two of them went into the village together, heading towards the old man's residence. They conducted a careful inspection in the room where the soldiers had stayed, but the "foreign cloth" was still not found. The old man started crying again. The instructor felt that this place had been severely devastated by Yan Xishan's bandits, the people were very poor, and more than a foot of foreign cloth was a big deal to the old man. He had to get to the bottom of it. Finally, they went to the old man's own north room to search. When the old man personally opened the cabinet, he saw that more than a foot of foreign cloth was lying flat and stable inside. The old man was stunned when he saw the foreign cloth, and became frightened, thinking that he had caused trouble. He was ashamed and afraid, and repeatedly said, "This is my fault. When you came, I was afraid you would take it, so I hid it here, then forgot, and only said that you took it. This is my mistake..." At this time, the instructor was not angry at all, but instead smiled and comforted him, saying, "Fellow villager, don't be afraid, it's good that the thing is found. If it couldn't be found, we would have compensated you. You must know that our People's Liberation Army will not take a single needle or thread from the people..."

Afterwards, the old man praised the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army everywhere. He constantly told the story of "the foreign cloth being found" to the people he knew.

　　“洋布”找着了
    晋中我军群众纪律小故事
    艾纯
    晋中的小麦黄了，阎匪统治下的老百姓眼看熟了的麦子将要吃不到了。在这时候解放军大队人马突然出现在晋中广大平川地带，某部被分配住在新解放了的祁县二区郜北徐家庄上。
    六月十九号，部队接到上级的命令要出发了，住在村西头的同志们有的上门板，有的扫院子，有的收拾屋子，还有的归还借用老百姓的东西，并向群众交代清楚；然后把队伍集合起来，就出发了。
    整齐的队伍刚走到了村外，只听见后边有人连哭带喊的赶着来了，大家以为出了什么事，都楞在那里。原来追来的就是部队住过的那个房东老汉，指导员忙迎上去向老汉问讯。“你们把我一丈多洋布给拿走了……”老汉吞吞吐吐，边哭边说。指导员说：“老乡不要哭了，要是我们拿了保证没不了你的，你坐下我给你问讯问讯。”于是马上叫在老汉家住的那排人停下来，一个一个的解开衣服背包，叫老汉在跟前亲自来清查验看。这时天下起雨来了，老汉见洋布找不着，没奈何的说：“不要检查了，你们快走吧！”指导员和战士们心里想着，事情真奇怪，怎么会有这样的事情发生？“不拿群众一针一线”的纪律教育同志们不会忘记的啊！大家都不放心，觉得这事情关系到解放军的名誉问题，都愿意闹个清楚明白。指导员先叫队伍走了，然后对老汉说：“老乡！咱再到你家里好好找着，如果找不着我们照价赔给你钱好了！”说着两人一齐进了村，向老汉住的地方走去。他俩在战士住的屋子里进行了仔细的检查，但是“洋布”仍然没有找见，老汉又哭起来。指导员感到这地方被阎匪糟踏的十分厉害，老百姓很穷苦，一丈多洋布对老汉来说能顶大事，一定要弄清楚，最后他们又到老汉自己住的北屋去找，当老汉亲手掀开柜一看，一丈多洋布平平稳稳的在柜里放着。老汉一见洋布也就楞住了，并且害怕起来，心想这可惹出祸事来了。他又羞又怕的连说：“这是我不对，你们来时我怕你们给拿走就藏在这里，后来忘了，只说你们给拿走，这是我的错，……”指导员这时不但毫没动气，反而笑嘻嘻的安慰他说：“老乡，你不要害怕，东西找到就是了，如果找不见的话，咱还要赔偿你的，要知道咱人民解放军是不会拿老百姓一针一线的……。”
    事后，老汉到处称赞解放军严明的纪律，他不断的把“洋布找着了”的故事，说给他熟识的人们听。
