Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, Urgent Telegram, 16th: The Jinzhong People's Liberation Army has won a great victory. Yan's bandits in Taiyuan have been completely isolated, and their final annihilation is just around the corner. Our army's important victories in the past few days are as follows:

(1) The headquarters of Yan's 34th Army and its subordinate 73rd Division, Provisional 44th Division, and part of the 10th Column, were completely annihilated by our army after three days and nights of fierce fighting on the 12th in the Dachangzhen and Nanzhuang area southeast of Xugou. The headquarters of Yan's 33rd Army and its subordinate 71st Division, Provisional 46th Division, and the remaining part of the 10th Column, have been surrounded by our army in the Xiaochang and Xifancun area southeast of Xugou and are being annihilated.

(2) Yan's 9th Column in Taigu fled towards Yuci on the 12th, but were surrounded by us in the Jiacun area northeast of Taigu. Except for a few who escaped and scattered, they were annihilated on the evening of the 13th; Taigu was liberated. Our army captured a lot of materials.

(3) Yan's 19th Army headquarters and remnants of the Provisional 40th Division in Pingyao, one regiment of Yan's Provisional 45th Division in Jiexiu, Yan's 43rd Army headquarters and remnants of the 70th Division in Fenyang and Xiaoyi, and Yan's 61st Army headquarters and remnants of the 69th Division in Wenshui, totaling more than 20,000 people, retreated to Wenshui on the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and then abandoned the city and fled north. On the 13th and 14th, they were intercepted by us in the area southwest of Qingyuan, with more than 8,000 people captured and some killed or wounded. The remaining troops fled north and are being pursued and annihilated by us. The five cities of Pingyao, Jiexiu, Xiaoyi, Fenyang, and Wenshui have all been liberated.

(4) Yan's 68th Division north of Taiyuan has also been completely surrounded by our army.

In total, since the Jinzhong Campaign began on June 14th, in just one month, our army has successively liberated eleven county towns including Lingshi, Jiaocheng, Qixian, Qingyuan, Xugou, Pingyao, Taigu, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Jiexiu, and Wenshui, and annihilated Yan's 34th Army, 19th Army, 43rd Army, and 61st Army headquarters, the 70th Division, 72nd Division, Provisional 40th Division, 69th Division, Provisional 37th Division, 73rd Division, and Provisional 44th Division, seven complete divisions, and one and a half columns. The 33rd Army headquarters, 71st Division, Provisional 46th Division, 68th Division, three divisions and half a column are still being encircled and annihilated. Yan's bandits have a total of five army headquarters, all of which have now been annihilated or are being annihilated; they have a total of fifteen divisions and three columns. In addition to the above-mentioned ten divisions and two columns that have been annihilated or are being annihilated, their 66th Division was annihilated in Linfen in May, and the Provisional 49th Division also suffered a devastating blow in Shouyang in May. The Provisional 45th Division, which fled from Xugou to the vicinity of Taiyuan, has only two regiments left (another regiment was annihilated southwest of Qingyuan this time), and the Provisional 39th Division in Xinxian has suffered repeated losses. Including the Provisional 38th Division that is about to be left in Datong, Yan's bandits now only have about three divisions and one column left. Yan's bandits originally controlled fifteen county towns in Jinzhong, and now they are only besieged in the four cities of Taiyuan Provincial Capital (Yangqu), Taiyuan County Town (renamed Jinyuan), Yuci, and Xinxian. Xinxian and Taiyuan Provincial Capital have also been cut off by our army.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, Urgent Telegram, 17th: Yan's 33rd Army and most of the 10th Column, which were surrounded by our Jinzhong Front People's Liberation Army southeast of Xugou, were completely annihilated on the 16th. Bandit leader Zhao Chengshou, commander of the 7th Army Group, and Shen Rui, commander of the 33rd Army, were captured alive. The results of the battle are being investigated.
