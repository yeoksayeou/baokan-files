To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:

　　Regarding the article "The Production Promotion Cooperative of Tang County" published on July 6th, the second paragraph states: "Grain loans and loans should be made as convenient as possible for the masses. The textiles loaned to disaster victims in the first and second districts for transportation and sales were bought with rice by the county promotion cooperative. According to their experience, it is best to lend the masses the physical goods they need." However, according to another report I received: "Tang County's first and second districts have suffered from consecutive years of drought and are the key areas for loans. The county promotion cooperative turned grain loans into textiles, loaning them to the masses for transportation and sales in Chahar and Yanbei, and organized the loan households into groups of six. As a result, Wangzhen Village lost money. Some borrowers even took the textiles to Zhuanlu (a market town not far from Tang County) to sell. Because they exchanged grain for textiles, the price of grain rose, and the county production promotion cooperative lost more than 10 million border currency."

　　Although the principles and experiences of providing grain loans and loans, organizing the masses to produce and overcome famine, making things as convenient as possible for the masses, and lending the masses the physical goods they need are all correct. However, judging from the facts reported by the two sides, the discrepancies are very large. I am writing to request that you continue to investigate and clarify the truth. (The material I based this on is the agricultural loan work report given by the Beiyue branch of the Border Region Bank to the head office in June 1948).

### 唐县生产推进社一稿与事实有出入

　　唐县生产推进社一稿
    与事实有出入人民日报编辑部：
    读七月六日报载“唐县的生产推进社”一文，第二段中称：“贷粮贷款尽量给群众以便利。一、二区贷给灾民运销的布匹，是县推进社了米买来的。根据他们的经验，以贷群众所需要的实物为最好”。但据我所得到的另一反映是：“唐县一、二区连年灾荒，是贷款的重点区，县推进社把贷粮变成了布，贷给群众运销察南、雁北，并把贷款户每组六户编制起来。结果王镇村赔了钱。亦有的贷户把布背到砖路（离唐县城不远的一个集镇）去卖，因变粮买布，粮价上涨，县生产推进社赔了边币一千多万元。”
    虽然贷粮贷款，组织群众生产渡荒，尽量给群众以便利，和把群众所需要的实物贷给群众等原则及经验都是对的。但从两者所报导的事实来看出入很大。特函，尚望继续查明真相。（我所据材料是边区银行北岳分行于一九四八年六月给总行的农贷工作报告）
