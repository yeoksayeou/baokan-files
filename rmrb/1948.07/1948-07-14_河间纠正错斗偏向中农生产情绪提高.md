[Hebei Central News] In the land reform in Hejian, more than half of the villages infringed upon the interests of some middle peasants to varying degrees, causing panic among other middle peasants and affecting their production morale. Since the end of March, when the county party committee convened a county-wide representative joint meeting, clarified the standards for class division, and implemented the policy of resolutely not infringing upon the interests of middle peasants, most villages have corrected or are in the process of correcting these errors.

According to statistics, there were incidents of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants in a total of 160 villages, involving 656 households. Among them, 325 households had their class status raised because people wanted to seize their property; some were wrongly classified because the class determination was traced back too far (about 20 years) from the establishment of the democratic government; some were raised because of slight exploitation; and 98 households had their property seized due to confusion between political and economic factors. The circumstances and extent of the infringements also varied. The doors of 199 households were wrongly sealed, and most or part of their property was seized. 169 households had not their doors sealed, but were forced to hand over part of their property or land. 181 households had their doors sealed but no property seized. 107 households were detained. At the beginning of the land reform, the poor peasant leagues in many villages also seriously excluded middle peasants, such as restricting middle peasants' activities in buying and selling, and only allowing middle peasants to perform wartime service, which caused panic and dissatisfaction among middle peasants. Some middle peasants were afraid of being struggled against and gave gifts to the representatives of the poor peasant leagues. Some, fearing the seizure of their property, fortified their homes. Others ate and drank lavishly, thinking they were getting their money's worth. During the spring plowing season, some middle peasants did not cultivate the land or apply fertilizer, fearing that if they did, it would be distributed to others, expressing great doubt about our party's policy of uniting with middle peasants.

The main reasons for infringing upon the interests of middle peasants were: on the one hand, the standards for class division were not clear at the time, and some leading cadres had "leftist" ideas, or catered to the tailism of the masses, or held purely pro-poor peasant views; on the other hand, some poor peasants and farm laborers harbored the idea of "getting a piece of the pie," and a few hooligans wanted to "get rich by taking advantage of the situation," deliberately raising the class status of middle peasants; some poor peasant league organizations were impure and controlled by landlords and bad elements, diverting the focus of struggle and harming the interests of middle peasants.

At the county-wide representative joint meeting, the central government's documents on class division and class determination were first studied, and then the situation in each village was reviewed in light of the documents. After the county party committee's explanation and guidance, most people understood the ideology and discussed the methods for correction. After the meeting, various localities seized the opportunity to implement policies and correct deviations. In terms of correction methods, most villages clarified the standards for class determination through agricultural association (or poor peasant league) group meetings, re-discussing and reviewing wrongly determined class status; after the majority of the masses agreed, they corrected the wrongly determined class status, and returned all or part of the property according to the actual situation of the infringement. They convened meetings with wrongly struggled households to explain the reasons and explain that they should no longer harbor doubts and dissatisfaction. If some property could not actually be returned in full, they apologized to the wrongly struggled households, and if the person concerned agreed, it would not be returned; if not returning it would affect the wrongly struggled households' lives and production, they tried every means to return it. At present, 123 villages in the county have been corrected, and 480 households have been thoroughly corrected. However, some problems have also occurred in the correction of deviations. Some villages only sent a few representatives and group leaders to study and then returned the property, while others were handled by district cadres who took over the responsibility without persuading the representatives and the masses, adopting the simple method of forced orders such as "returning it, whether you want to or not," which caused dissatisfaction among poor peasants and farm laborers and greatly affected the work. The county party committee has pointed out that in future production movements, it is necessary to continue to vigorously implement the policy of correctly treating middle peasants, thoroughly correct deviations, and further unite middle and poor peasants in production.

After correcting the deviations that infringed upon the interests of middle peasants, most middle peasants clarified our party's policies, stabilized their morale, and improved their production enthusiasm. Middle peasant Sun Shouxin said, "Everyone's eyes are really bright! Everyone knows who is who, and we can't make mistakes." After Cui Zhengyan, a middle peasant in Beidong Village, Fourth District, was wrongly struggled against, his family stopped working, and the weaving machine was also stopped. After the correction of deviations, his family's enthusiasm for work was revived.

### 河间纠正错斗偏向中农生产情绪提高

　　河间纠正错斗偏向中农生产情绪提高
    【冀中讯】河间在土地改革中，有半数以上的村庄，或轻或重的侵犯了一些中农利益，引起其他中农的恐慌，影响了他们的生产情绪。自三月底县委召开全县代表联席会，明确研究了划阶级的标准，贯彻了坚决不侵犯中农利益的政策后，一般村庄已经纠正或正在纠正中。
    根据统计：全县有侵犯中农利益的现象共一百六十个村，侵犯了六百五十六户。其中有三百二十五户是因为想弄东西提高了成份；有的因为定成份时从民主政府成立往前追的太远（追二十年左右）而定错了；有的是因为有点轻微剥削而提高的；因政治、经济分不清而动了东西的有九十八户。侵犯的情形和程度也不一样，有一百九十九户错封了门，弄了大部或一部东西。有一百六十九户未封门而强迫弄了部分东西或土地。有一百八十一户封了门没弄东西。被扣押的有一百零七户。在土改开始时，许多村庄的贫农团排斥中农也很严重，如限制中农活动买卖，光让中农出战勤等，引起中农的恐慌不满。有的中农怕斗，给贫农团代表送礼，有的怕弄东西而坚壁起来，有的大吃大喝，认为吃了是赚头。春耕时有些中农不种地不上粪，怕种上再分给别人，对我党团结中农政策表示了很大的怀疑。
    侵犯中农的主要原因：一方面是当时划阶级的标准不明确，有些领导干部存在着“拔尖思想”，或是迁就群众的尾巴主义，或存在着单纯的贫雇农观点；一方面是有一部分贫雇农抱着“吃肉疙瘩”的想头，还有少数流氓分子想“乘机发财”，故意提高中农成份；有的是贫农团组织不纯，被地主坏分子掌握，转移了斗争目标，损害了中农利益。
    在全县代表联席会上，先学习了中央关于划阶级定成份的文件，接着联系本村情况进行检讨，经过县委解释、诱导，一般的搞通了思想，并讨论了纠正的办法。会后各地抓紧贯彻政策、纠正偏向。在纠正的方法上，一般村庄都通过农会（或贫农团）小组会，反复讲明定成份的标准，重新讨论审查错定的成份；经过多数群众同意后，即改正错定成份，并根据被侵犯的实际情况，退回全部或一部东西。召开错斗户讲明道理，说明他们不该再怀疑和不满。有些东西实际上不能全部退回的，即向错斗户道歉，他本人同意了可不退；如不退而会影响错斗户的、生活和生产的，则想尽一切办法退回。现全县已纠正了一百二十三个村，彻底纠正了四百八十户。但纠偏中也发生了些毛病，有的村仅出少数代表和组长研究一下就退了，有的是区干部包办代替，不说服代表和群众，采取了“退也退、不退也得退”的强迫命令的简单方法，因此引起了贫雇农的不满，使工作受到很大影响。县委已指出在今后生产运动中，继续大力贯彻端正对中农的政策，彻底纠偏，使中贫农更进一步的团结生产。
    经过纠正侵犯中农的偏向后，一般中农都明确了我党的政策，情绪稳定，生产情绪提高，中农孙守信说：“大伙眼光真亮！谁是什么主儿都知道，不能错了。”四区北冬村中农崔正严被错斗后，一家子活也不干，织布机也停了。经过纠偏，一家子干活又起了劲。
