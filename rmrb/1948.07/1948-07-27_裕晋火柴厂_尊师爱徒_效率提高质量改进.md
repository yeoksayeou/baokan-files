Taiyue Electric: The Taiyue Yujin Match Factory, after correcting the "leftist" deviation in worker relations during this year's May Day celebrations, put forward the slogan "Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices." The relationship between masters and apprentices throughout the factory has improved, and both production quantity and quality have significantly increased. The old concept of "keeping a secret when teaching apprentices" has begun to change in the minds of most veteran workers. Zhang Guanwu, the chairman of the labor union, said: In the past, due to a lack of understanding of the correct policy of worker movements, many "leftist" deviations occurred in the relationship between masters and apprentices. Some apprentices demanded extreme democracy. If the master said a few words to the apprentice, the apprentice would not speak to the master for several days, and some would say negative things behind his back, deliberately lowering the master's prestige. Masters were therefore dissatisfied with apprentices and unwilling to teach them their skills, which affected the unity of veteran workers and apprentices and the improvement of production. The labor union and the factory once mistakenly selected apprentices as group leaders on the machines in each department, further causing unrest and dissatisfaction among the veteran workers. This was clearly agricultural socialism, which undermined productivity. After "Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices" was proposed this year on May Day, the relationship between masters and apprentices has improved. Apprentices have begun to respect the master's teachings, and the master has also paid attention to explaining techniques to apprentices and carefully guiding their work. Therefore, both skills and output have improved. In the past, the matchsticks produced by the peeling machines and cutting machines were of poor quality, resulting in a lot of waste. Now most of them can be used. The factory and the labor union have accepted this experience and further clarified that improving the relationship between masters and apprentices is the key to improving production.

The Yujin Match Factory is a relatively large match factory in the Taiyue Liberated Area, with 160 employees, a 15-horsepower gas engine, a 5-kilowatt generator, and small machines such as log peelers, splint peelers, and stick cutting machines. From December of last year to the present, production efficiency has increased from three boxes per day to ten boxes per day. This match factory, like other industrial constructions in the liberated areas, has gradually developed from small to large. Manager Hao said: "The workers demonstrated extraordinary creativity and amazing efforts in building this factory. The factory's 15-horsepower gas engine was originally a gasoline engine, which required one barrel of gasoline (27 catties) per day, worth 200,000 yuan (Jicha, the currency of the time). Worker Hao Dehai painstakingly researched and transformed it into the current gas engine, which burns a maximum of 300 catties of coal per day, costing less than 2,000 yuan, more than 100 times cheaper than before. Worker Yuan Xueli created a small blade machine on the splint peeling machine, which can replace the function of a marking machine. Initially, there was no stick cutting machine, so Zhao Futang came up with a way to replace it with something else. After a lot of repairs and modifications, he finally built this match factory."

　　裕晋火柴厂“尊师爱徒”
  　效率提高质量改进
    【太岳电】太岳裕晋火柴厂，在今年“五一”节纠正职工关系上的左倾偏向，提出“尊师爱徒”的口号后，全厂师徒关系已有改善，生产数量和质量也有显著提高；“教学徒要留一手”的旧观念，在一般老工人的思想上已经有了改变。工会主任张官武说：过去由于没有掌握正确的职工运动的方针，在师徒关系上曾发生过不少左倾偏向，有些学徒要求极端民主，师傅说学徒几句，学徒就几天不和师傅说话，有的背地说些二话，故意降低师傅威信。师傅因此不满学徒，不愿再教给学徒技术，影响到老工人与学徒的团结和生产的提高。工会和厂方曾经错误的把各部机器上的小组长都选给学徒当，更加引起老工人的不安和不满，这明明是农业社会主义，破坏生产力。今年“五一”节提出“尊师爱徒”以后，师徒关系已有改善，学徒开始尊重师傅的教导，师傅也注意给学徒讲解技术，并细心指导学徒工作，困此技术和产量都提高了。过去剥杆机、切杆机制造的火柴杆，因为质量不好，浪费很多，现在大部能够使用了。厂方和工会接受了这一段经验，更加明确了目前改善师徒关系是提高生产的关键。
    裕晋火柴厂是太岳解放区较大的一个火柴厂，全厂有一百六十个职工，有一部十五马力的煤气机和一部五个启罗的发电机，及轴木剥机，盒片剥机，切杆机，盒片切机等小型机。从去年十二月到现在，生产效率已由日出三箱增加到日出十箱。这个火柴厂和解放区的其他工业建设一样，是从小到大，逐步发展起来的。郝经理说：“工友们创建这个工厂，曾经发挥了卓越的创造和惊人的努力。该厂十五马力的煤气机原是一部汽油机，每日需一筒汽油（二十七斤），价值二十万元（冀钞，下同）。工友郝德海苦心研究改造，改成了现在的煤气机，每日最多烧三百斤煤，所费不足两千元，与前相较，价低一百多倍。工友袁学礼在盒片剥机上创造一部小刀机，可以代替一部划印机的功用。起初没有切杆机，赵福堂就想出用别的东西来代替；经过很多的修理改造，终于建设成了这个火柴厂。
