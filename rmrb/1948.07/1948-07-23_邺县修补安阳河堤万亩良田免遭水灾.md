[Taihang Telegram] The democratic government of the Fifth District of Yexian (east of Anyang, newly established county) actively controlled the Anyang River disaster, saving tens of thousands of acres of fertile land from flooding. The district is located close to the Anyang River, which is three to four zhang wide. There is a section of embankment, about half a li long, which has been eroded by the river water over the years, and is now two zhang and five chi lower than the original embankment. Under the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn elements Wang Ziquan and Cheng Daosheng, the local people had neither the leadership nor the will to repair it. Every year when the rainy season came, the river water would surge over the banks, causing serious flooding. In Qicun, Wadian, and other eighteen villages, tens of thousands of acres (a quarter of the total cultivated land) of autumn crops were often flooded, some turning into water pits, some becoming river channels, leading to years of famine. In view of this, our Fifth District Government took advantage of the gap between sowing and weeding this year to convene a meeting of village cadres to mobilize and arrange embankment repairs. Comrade Chen Lianbin, the deputy district chief, personally went to the river embankment to observe and, according to the size of the project and the amount of labor available in each village, divided the project into several sections and assigned them to each village. The original plan was to use four thousand workers and complete it in five days; however, because the masses were very active and motivated, and worked tirelessly, it was all completed in four days.

　　邺县修补安阳河堤万亩良田免遭水灾
    【太行电】邺县（安阳东、新设县）五区民主政府积极治理安阳河患，万亩良田免遭水灾。该区紧靠安阳河，河宽三、四丈，有堤一段，长约半里，经历年河水冲刷，已低于原堤两丈五尺。当地群众在蒋顽王自全、程道生压榨下，既无人倡导，也无心补修，每年一到雨季，河水即暴涨出岸，造成严重水患。奇村、瓦店等十八个村经常有万亩（占总耕地四分之一）秋禾遭水淹没，有的变成水坑，有的成了河渠，酿成连年灾荒。我五区政府有鉴于此，即乘今年下种锄苗的空隙，召开各村干部会议，动员布置修堤事宜。副区长陈联斌同志亲至河堤观测，按工程大小及各村民力多少，将工程分成数段，分给各村。原计划用四千工，五天修成；但因群众非常积极主动，努力不懈，四日即全部修竣。
