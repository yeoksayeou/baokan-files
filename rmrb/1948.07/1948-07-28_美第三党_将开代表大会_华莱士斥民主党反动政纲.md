Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 24th. TASS, New York, July 20th dispatch: The Third Party Congress, to be held in Philadelphia on July 23rd, will be attended by more than 2,500 representatives of workers, farmers, youth, and intellectuals. It is expected that all 48 states will be represented at the congress. According to an announcement to the press by Baldwin, director of Wallace's campaign committee, the congress will not only nominate Wallace and Taylor as the new party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates, but will also formally establish the new party and adopt the new party's official name. It is expected that one-third to one-half of the congress delegates will be workers, trade unionists, scientists, artists, and writers. In addition, there will be hundreds of black delegates, and the number of women delegates will greatly exceed those attending the Republican and Democratic Party conventions. Before the opening of the congress, the platform committee, composed of 53 members, will hold a public hearing to listen to the opinions of various mass organizations and trade unions on the content of the platform. The congress is scheduled to pass the nomination of presidential and vice-presidential candidates on the 24th, and the congress on the 25th will pass the election platform and elect the new party's national committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 22nd. According to a TASS New York dispatch of July 17th, U.S. Third Party presidential candidate Wallace recently issued a statement to the press commenting on Truman's announcement at the Democratic Party convention that a special Congress would be convened on July 26th to discuss price and housing issues. Wallace warned that unless the American people push for the realization of their demands, the special Congress convened by Truman "will not do a single good thing, and may even do a lot of bad things." Wallace said: "The creative power of the new party forces all parties to talk about liberalism in words, even though they are doing reactionary things." Analyzing the Democratic Party's election platform, Wallace said that Truman should be held responsible for abolishing price controls and obstructing the passage of housing plans. He said: "This proves the necessity of establishing a new party, because it is futile to place any hope in the Democratic Party."

  　将开代表大会
  　华莱士斥民主党反动政纲
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社纽约二十日电讯，七月二十三日在费城召开的第三党代表大会，将有工人、农民、青年及知识分子的代表二千五百余人参加。预料四十八州均将有代表出席大会。据华莱士竞选委员会主任鲍尔温向报界宣布，此次大会不仅将提名华莱士与泰勒为新党的正副总统候选人，且将正式成立新党，并通过新党的正式名称。大会代表将有三分之一至二分之一为工人、职工运动者、科学家、艺术家与作家。此外，尚有黑人代表数百名，妇女代表则将大大超过出席共和与民主两党大会的代表。大会开幕前，由五十三人组成的政纲委员会，将举行公开报告会，听取各群众团体及职工会对政纲内容的意见，预定二十四日的大会通过正副总统候选人的提名，二十五日的大会通过竞选政纲及选举新党的全国委员会。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据塔斯社纽约十七日电，美第三党总统候选人华莱士顷向报界发表声明，评论杜鲁门在民主党大会上宣布将于七月二十六日召开特别国会，以讨论物价与房屋问题的举措。华莱士警告称：除非美国人民力促实现他们的要求，否则杜鲁门召集的特别国会，“将做不出一件好事，甚至会做出很大的坏事来。”华氏称：“新党创造性的力量，迫使各政党口头要谈自由主义，纵然他们做的是反动的事情。”华氏于分析民主党的竞选政纲时说，杜鲁门要负取消物价管制和阻挠通过住宅计划的责任。他说：“这证明新党成立的必要，因为把任何希望寄托在民主党身上都是枉然的。”
