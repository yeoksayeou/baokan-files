　　【Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 7th】 Seeking Light and Participating in Revolutionary Work: Over a Thousand Students from Kaifeng Go to Liberated Areas; Many Clerks, Shop Assistants, Engineers, and Teachers Also Sign Up.

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 7th】 After the end of the battle of Kaifeng on the 22nd, large numbers of young students from major middle schools in the Kaifeng urban area went to the rear of the liberated areas to study, reaching over a thousand people before and after. Not long after the battle ended on the 22nd, more than 500 students went to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, requesting to be escorted to North China University to study. The PLA unit gave them a warm reception and held a get-together before their departure. At the meeting, the students all recounted the terrorist persecution by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and expressed their long-cherished desire to study and participate in revolutionary work in the liberated areas. A student from Kaifeng High School said that until the liberation, students at the school were still being arrested. Many of these students were forced onto the front lines as expendable victims by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and suffered persecution from Chiang Kai-shek's indiscriminate bombing. At the same time, they personally witnessed the People's Liberation Army's care for the students, thus strengthening their belief in going to the liberated areas. After the joint enrollment announcement of North China University and other schools in the liberated areas was posted on the 24th, the registration office in front of Drum Tower Street was crowded with young male and female students all day long. They came to register with suitcases and bedrolls on their backs. A water conservancy engineer sent his seventeen-year-old son to register; a civil servant tearfully insisted on sending his daughter, who had been injured in a bombing by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, to the liberated area to study. Many students ran away from home to register. Two students left letters to their loved ones, saying that they were "going to pursue the light" and hoped that they would follow them. Many young professionals, such as post office clerks, shop assistants, engineers, and teachers, also came to register to participate in work and study in the liberated areas. Teachers and students from Luoyang Middle School, Luoyang Normal School, Qinyang Middle School, Yancheng Middle School, and Xuchang Middle School, who had been coerced into moving to Kaifeng, also returned to the western Henan liberated area in large numbers to study and teach. When the People's Liberation Army withdrew from Kaifeng, there were still more than a hundred young students carrying luggage, determined to follow the People's Liberation Army to the liberated areas.

　　追求光明参加革命工作
    开封千余学生到解放区
    很多职员店员工程师教员也纷纷报名
    【新华社开封前线七日电】开封市区各大中学青年学生大批前往解放区后方求学，前后已达一千余人。二十二日战斗结束不久，即有学生五百余人到解放军某部，要求护送至华北大学求学。该部解放军当予热烈招待，临行前并举行联欢会。会上学生都倾诉蒋匪特务的恐怖迫害，和希望到解放区学习与参加革命工作的宿愿。开封高中一学生说，直到解放前，该校尚有学生被捕。这些学生中有不少是因这次亲历蒋匪强迫上火线作牺牲品和遭蒋机滥炸的迫害；同时又亲自看到解放军对学生的爱护，因而坚定了他们前往解放区的信念。二十四日解放区华北大学等校联合招生布告贴出后，鼓楼街报名处门前整日拥塞青年男女学生，他们提着箱子、背着被包，前来报名。有一个水利工程师把自己一个十七岁的儿子送来报名；一个公务员流着眼泪，坚决要把已被蒋机轰炸负伤的女儿送到解放区求学。很多学生瞒着家里跑来报名。有两个学生留信与爱人告别说自己“追求光明去了”，希望她们也跟上来。很多职业青年如邮局职员、店员、工程师、教员也纷纷前来报名，参加解放区工作和学习。被胁迫迁往开封之洛阳中学、洛阳师范、沁阳中学、郾城中学、许昌中学等各校师生，此次亦大批返回豫西解放区求学和任教。当解放军撤离开封时，尚有百余青年学生背负行李，坚随解放军来解放区。
