    Warmly Welcomes New Soldiers Enlisting
    A Certain Commander Calls on Veteran Soldiers to Help New Soldiers
    [North Yue News] After the North Line Campaign, the East Sea Department welcomed a large number of liberated peasants into the army. The entire army launched a "Welcome New Soldiers Movement Week," and the military and political organs organized welcome committees to travel far and wide to extend greetings. On June 12th, the welcome committee arrived at ×× Village. Under the personal guidance of Director Zhang and Deputy Chief of Staff Liu, they swiftly completed various preparations. The streets and alleys were thoroughly cleaned, brand new archways were erected at each intersection, and colorful slogans were posted everywhere. Each dormitory in the reception center was marked with a number and bed assignment (how many people per room). The rooms were thoroughly cleaned, and the kang (sleeping platform) was neatly covered with mats and straw. The kitchen pots, bowls, ladles, and basins had long been put in place, and the water vats were filled to the brim. Supply personnel had prepared grain, firewood, oil, salt, and vegetables. The cultural troupe organized a propaganda shed and a costumed welcome team, and the Children's Corps of ×× Village also joined this welcome movement. At 2:00 PM on the 13th, the first group of new soldiers appeared at the village entrance. The whole village was immediately in an uproar, with gongs and drums, slogans, cheers... all blending into one. People enthusiastically twisted, danced, sang, and shouted. The old people in the village said, "Even during the Spring Festival, it's not as lively as this!" After an eight or nine-day long march, the new comrades, under such a warm welcome, were all so excited that they forgot their fatigue. Several new comrades in the ranks couldn't help but start twisting with the yangge dance team. Some new comrades, upon hearing slogans such as "Defend our homes and fields" and "Avenge the people," couldn't help but shout, "Yes! We must resolutely carry it through to the end!" The next afternoon, a warm welcome meeting was held under the auspices of the welcome committee. Many new comrades voluntarily went on stage to speak. In the evening, the cultural troupe performed newly rehearsed programs such as "Welcome New Soldiers."
    [Further News] On June 11th, a certain commander of the department, at an enlarged cadre meeting, called on all veteran soldiers in the army to help the new soldiers well, to quickly understand and get used to the life in the company. He said: Every veteran soldier should care about and help the new comrades to progress. They should earnestly lead the new comrades to actively learn various military techniques and use opportunities during casual conversations to tell them about the organization and system within the company, the military and political discipline that should be observed, and what should be done every morning after waking up and after eating (daily schedule); they should tell the new comrades how to organize their personal belongings, how to place their clothes after taking them off at night, how to carry things, how to take care of weapons, and how to move quickly... He said: These problems should not only be told once or twice how to do them, but also explain in detail, little by little, why they should be done this way. Only when everyone understands these reasons will they be more motivated and easier to become familiar with.

　　东海部组织欢迎团
    热烈欢迎新战士入伍
    某司令员号召老战士帮助新战士
    【北岳讯】东海部在北线战役结束后，欢迎大批翻身农民入伍，全军开展了欢迎新战士运动周，并由军政机关组织欢迎团远出欢迎。六月十二日，欢迎团到达××村，在张主任、刘副参谋长的亲自指导下，迅速的完成了各种准备工作。大街小巷进行了彻底的打扫，各个街口扎了崭新的牌楼，到处张贴了彩色标语。招待所的每一个宿舍门口，标明着号码与床位（住几个人），屋里打扫的很干净，炕上平平整整的铺好了席子和铺草。伙房里的锅、碗、瓢、盆早就安置好了，水缸里都挑满了水。供给人员们准备好了粮食、柴火、油盐蔬菜。文工团组织了鼓动棚与化装欢迎队，××村的儿童团也卷入这一欢迎运动。十三号下午两点钟，第一队新战士在村头出现了，村里村外顿时闹翻了天，锣鼓声，口号声，欢呼声，……混成一片。人们热情地扭着、跳着、唱着、呼喊着，该村老人们说：“过大年也没有这样烘火过！”经过八九天长途行军的新同志们，在这样热烈的欢迎下，一个个都兴奋的忘去了疲劳，有几个新同志在行列里，也情不自禁地随着秧歌队扭起来了。有的新同志听到“保家保田”、“为老百姓报仇”等口号时，不由的喊出：“对！我们一定要坚决干到底！”第二天下午，在欢迎团主持下，举行了热烈的欢迎大会。好多新同志自动到台上去讲了话，晚上文工团演出了新赶排的“欢迎新战士”等节目。
    【又讯】六月十一日，该部某司令员在扩大干部会上，号召全军的老战士要好好帮助新战士，迅速了解与习惯连队的生活。他说：每个老战士应该关心、帮助新同志的进步。应该认真带领新同志积极学习各种军事技术，并利用平时闲谈的机会，告诉他们连里面的组织和制度，应该遵守的军事纪律与政治纪律，每天早晨起来和吃了饭应干的事情（作息时间）；要告诉新同志们怎样整理内务，晚上脱下衣服应该怎样放置，东西怎样背法，武器怎样保管，怎样动作才能迅速……。他说：这些问题不仅要一次一次告诉人们怎样做，还要详细地、一点一滴的说明为什么要这样做。只有叫大家都明白了这些道理，做起来才会更有劲，更容易熟悉。
