　　【Taiyue News】After Yicheng North Pass compensated for wrongly struggled industry and commerce, 19 shops renovated and built market houses and tidied up their storefronts, and more than 30 were converted from public to private operation. Yicheng North Pass is a distribution center for goods traded between the mountainous areas of southern Shanxi and the plains, known as "Yicheng Pass that can't be filled, Yicheng Pass that can't be carried away." The city's industry and commerce had long been devastated by the plundering and destruction of the Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek, and Yan Xishan. It is gradually recovering and developing after liberation. During the mass movement last autumn, 31 businesses were mistakenly struggled against (15 were struggled against by locals, and 16 were struggled against by masses from Fushan and Qinshui), affecting merchants' willingness to do business boldly, and many large shops became small stalls. Wang Meixuan separated his company name. Ren Shouyi said, "Last winter, I only displayed a few flints and pigments, and I dared not sell yellow silk, let alone put it out. Someone said I was 'capable,' which scared me for days." The North Pass work team resolutely implemented the policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce. On the 15th, they first returned Jia Liyan's mountain goods shop (worth more than 3 million Jicha), which was changed in name but not in substance. On the 16th, they returned the struggled items to Yongji Store and Dongxinglong Tobacco Shop. The merchants were all smiles when they saw the goods being carried back through the streets. They witnessed 54 barrels of pigments (worth more than 2.9 million yuan) being returned to Yongji and other stores. Zhang Mingrui said, "In the past, I dared not put out my inventory, and I only dared to take out one or two dozen out of ten dozen towels, for fear that people would say I had too much; now I want to borrow goods from others to display, only fearing that there are too few goods to attract customers." Now the North Pass market has begun to be active, and the shelves of that store are full of various goods. Nineteen stores are repairing and building houses and tidying up their storefronts, and more than 30 public-owned commercial firms are clearing up organ production and transferring them to private operation according to instructions. Ren Houqing, the shopkeeper of Yongji Store, said, "This is great, with capital, why worry about not making a fortune?"

　　退还错斗工商业后
    翼城市场日渐活跃
    【太岳讯】翼城北关赔偿错斗工商业后，有十九家商店修盖市房，整理门面，有三十多家由公营转入私营。翼城北关是晋南山岳地带与平原通商货物的集散地，人称“填不满的翼城关，担不完的翼城关”。该城工商业经日寇蒋阎的掠夺摧残，早已不象样了。解放后正在逐渐恢复与发展。在去年秋天大运动时误斗了三十一家（十五家本关斗的，十六家浮山、沁水群众去斗的），影响商人不敢大胆做卖买，不少大商店变成了小摊贩。王美轩把字号分开了。任守义说：“去年冬天我只摆了几块火石颜料，不敢卖黄丝，更不敢摆出来，有人说了我一句‘能干’，吓的我心里多日不安。”北关工作组坚决执行保护发展工商业政策，在十五日先退还了换神不换庙的贾立岩的山货铺（值三百多万冀钞），十六日又给永记商店与东兴隆烟房退还被斗的东西。商人们看见从街上走过扛着送还的货物，都喜笑颜开，他们亲眼看到五十四桶颜料（价值二百九十多万元）退还给永记等商店了。张明瑞说：“过去有存货不敢往出摆，有十打手巾只敢往出拿一两打，只怕人说咱有；现在就想借上人家的货摆出来，只怕货少招不来客人。”现在北关市场开始活跃，那家商店的货架上都摆满了各种货物，有十九家修盖房子，整理门面，三十多家公营商号清理机关生产，根据指示转给私人经营。永记商店掌柜任厚卿说：“这可好了，有本钱还愁不发财？”
