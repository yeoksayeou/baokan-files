The North China Industry and Commerce Conference discussed the relationship between public and private industrial and commercial enterprises. Under the general principle of resolutely protecting private industrial and commercial enterprises, and the public sector supporting the private sector, so as to enable the joint development of both, it made clear and specific resolutions.

First, the meeting decided that, with the exception of the munitions industry, all industries are permitted to be privately operated or jointly operated by public and private entities. State-owned industries should concentrate on heavy industry, munitions industry, machine manufacturing industry, and the manufacturing of important industrial raw materials. In light industry, the state will only operate businesses that private capital cannot afford and are urgently needed for the people's livelihood. Many existing handicraft workshops and small machine industries within state-owned industries are all prepared to be transferred to cooperatives, institutional production, and private operation. A clear division of labor between the public and private sectors is to be made, so that private industry has a broad space for development. Businessmen from the Kuomintang-controlled areas are welcome to invest in industry and commerce in the liberated areas, and various assistance and conveniences will be provided.

Second, the meeting pointed out that state-owned commerce should serve the liberation war and people's production, not for profit. The government does not specifically assign financial tasks to state-owned commerce. The task of state-owned commerce is to control and stabilize the prices of major materials related to the people's livelihood, promote the sales of industrial, agricultural, and sideline products, and supply the people with necessary means of production and living. In terms of price policy, state-owned commerce should work with private merchants to stabilize prices and support production. State-owned stores should not exercise control and monopoly, and at the same time, any private commercial hoarding and speculation should be opposed.

Third, the government has granted some privileges to state-owned enterprises, such as the monopoly operation of the munitions industry, the unified procurement of military supplies, the management of the banking industry by the National Bank through the issuance of currency, the management of gold and silver and KMT currency and exchange rates, the monopoly of liquor production, and the unified purchase of saltpeter and sulfur. The meeting unanimously agreed that granting these privileges to state-owned enterprises is reasonable and necessary in terms of the requirements of the war and the economic struggle against the enemy, which in turn is also beneficial to private enterprises. However, apart from these privileges granted by law, state-owned enterprises and institutional production no longer have any other privileges.

Fourth, state-owned enterprises should actively provide assistance to private industrial and commercial enterprises. The meeting decided that banks should provide loans to industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and provide support. They should appropriately provide foreign exchange to private industrial and commercial enterprises to purchase necessary raw materials and tools. State-owned stores should establish material adjustment agencies in major cities to help solve the raw material difficulties of private industry, and establish retail departments in major cities to sell parts of the unified procurement of military supplies that are needed by private industry. Public and private transportation businesses should set freight rates that are conducive to the development of industry, agriculture, and commerce.

Many private industrial and commercial representatives were extremely excited about the discussion of the relationship between public and private sectors at this conference. A Shijiazhuang representative who attended the conference said: "This regulation makes private industrialists and businessmen dare to develop boldly."

　　会议明确规定公营私营关系
  　公营扶助私营  共同发展繁荣
    【本报讯】华北工商业会议对于公营私营工商业间的关系问题，在坚决保护私营工商业，公营扶助私营，以便使公私工商业共同发展的总精神下，进行讨论，作出了明确而具体的决议。
    第一，会议决定除军火工业外，一切工业均准许私人经营或公私合营。公营工业应集中力量举办重工业、军火工业、机器制造工业、重要工业原料材料制造工业等，在轻工业方面，国家则仅经营私人财力所不及而又为国民生计所迫切需要的事业。公营工业中现有的许多手工业作坊与小的机器工业全部准备转让给合作社、机关生产与私人经营。把公营与私营做出明确分工，以便使私营工业有广阔发展的地盘。欢迎蒋管区工商业家到解放区投资于工商业，并给以各种帮助与便利。
    第二，会议指出公营商业应为解放战争与人民生产服务，不以赢利为目的。政府不特别赋予公营商业以财政任务。公营商业的任务在于掌握与稳定与国民生计有关的主要物资的价格，推销工业、农业与副业生产品，供给人民必需的生产资料与生活资料。在物价政策上，公营商业应与私商共同来稳定物价与扶助生产。公营商店不应统制垄断，同时也要反对任何私人商业囤积居奇，投机操纵。
    第三，政府曾给予公营企业以一些特权，如军火工业的垄断经营，军用品的统一采购，国家银行发行货币管理银钱业，管理金银与蒋币蒋汇，酒专烧，硝磺统购等。会议一致认为这些特权授予公营企业，就战争与对敌经济斗争的要求来说，是合理的，必要的，这反回来对私营企业也是有利的。但除了法律授与的这些特权以外，公营企业与机关生产不再有其他任何特权。
    第四，公营企业应对私营工商业积极的给以帮助。会议决定银行应对有利于国计民生的工商业举办贷款，加以扶助，应适当的供给外汇给私营工商业以购买必须的原料与工具，公营商店在各主要城镇设立物资调剂机构以协助解决私营工业的原料困难，在主要城镇设立门市部出售统一采购的军用品中为私营工业所需要的部分，公私交通事业规定运价应有利于工农商业之发展等。
    此次大会讨论公私关系问题，许多私营工商业代表极为兴奋。参加大会的一位石家庄代表说：“这样规定，使私人工商业者敢于大胆发展”。
