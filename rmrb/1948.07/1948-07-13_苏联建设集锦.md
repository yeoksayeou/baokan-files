Soviet Construction Highlights
    △Before the war, the Soviet Union's electricity supply ranked third in the world (tsarist Russia ranked eleventh) and second in Europe. Now it has jumped to second in the world and first in Europe. The Soviet Union's total electricity supply currently exceeds pre-war records by 12 percent. The Soviet Union invented methods for utilizing all kinds of fuel. Currently, the Soviet Union has manufactured 400 types of electric agricultural machines. Experiments with electric tractors have been successful, which will save about 30 percent of labor and a large amount of fuel. The Five-Year Plan proposes to increase the electricity supply to agriculture by 1.8 million kilowatts and build 5,325 kilometers of new electric railways.
    △The Soviet Union has calculated the hydroelectric resources of 1,500 large rivers, with a total power generation capacity of 300 million kilowatts. From 1945 to 1950, the Soviet Union will restore and build 50 large power stations, some of which have been completed and are generating electricity. In addition, 18,000 power stations with a total power of 1 million kilowatts will be built on smaller rivers, of which 4,000 power stations will generate electricity this year.
    △The Soviet government has allocated 540 million rubles for housing construction in Moscow this year, and 415,000 square meters of housing will be built.
    △Leningrad, which suffered losses exceeding 40 billion rubles during the war, is continuing to rebuild. Many important enterprises have greatly exceeded pre-war production levels. The restoration of the hydroelectric station has been completed. Since the lifting of the siege, the city has restored and built 2.5 million square meters of housing.
    △The industry of Stalingrad has been largely restored. 900,000 square meters of housing have been built. Tram lines, water supply, telephone, and radio communications have been restored and are being expanded. The city has opened 79 schools, 86 kindergartens, 15 hospitals, and 20 general hospitals.
    △Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, has restored 500 types of enterprises and built 450,000 square meters of housing. Schools and medical colleges have been almost completely restored.
    △Minsk, the capital of Belarus, is busy with construction from the city center to the distant suburbs. Seventy-five industrial enterprises have started operations in the city. Eleven universities, seventeen industrial schools, and thirty-four schools have been opened or are preparing to open. The city has rebuilt 210,000 square meters of housing.
    △Three large turbines of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the largest in Europe, are in operation, and the fourth is being installed. A huge water gate across the Kura River in Azerbaijan is under construction, which will supply power to the Baku oilfields and irrigate 770 kilometers of land. Twelve consecutive hydroelectric stations on the Bolshaya River near Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, have been completed to the seventh. At the Syr Darya River power station in Uzbekistan, 16 million cubic meters of earth have been moved, and all the skeletons have been erected, and two pulleys have generated electricity.
    △The production of Ukraine's machine-building industry has increased by 70 percent compared to last year. All the factories in Ukraine that were destroyed during the war have been reopened.

　　苏联建设集锦
    △战前，苏联电力供应居世界第三位（沙俄时代居世界第十一位），欧洲第二位，现在它已跃居世界第二位，欧洲第一位。目前苏联电力的总供应量超过战前纪录百分之十二。苏联发明了利用一切种类燃料的方法。现在，苏联制造出了四百种电气农业机器。使用电气的拖拉机的实验已告成功，它将节省百分之三十左右的劳动力和大批燃料。五年计划拟定增加农业的电力供应一百八十万千瓦，建设新的电气铁道五千三百二十五公里。
    △苏联已计算了一千五百条大河的水电资源，全部可发电三亿千瓦。自一九四五年到一九五○年，苏联将修复和新建五十个巨大电力站，其中有一批已经竣工和发电；此外，在各较小的河流上，将建筑一万八千个电力站，共有电力一百万千瓦，其中四千个电力站将于年内发电。
    △苏联政府已拨款五亿四千万卢布，充作今年莫斯科建筑住宅之用；将建造四十一万五千平方公尺的住宅。
    △战争中损失超出四百亿卢布的列宁格勒在继续重建中。许多重要企业已大大超过战前生产水平。水电站的恢复工作已告完成。自从解围以来，列城已修复和建造了二百五十万平方公尺的住宅。
    △斯大林格勒的工业，大体上已告恢复。已建造了九十万平方公尺的住宅。电车线、自来水、电话及无线电报交通业已恢复，并正在扩大中。斯城已开办七十九所学校，八十六所幼稚园、十五所医院及二十所全科医院。
    △乌克兰首都基辅已恢复五百种企业，建造了四十五万平方公尺的住宅。学校和医学研究院几已全部恢复。
    △白俄罗斯首都明斯克，从市中心到遥远的郊外，都忙着建筑。市内已有七十五种工业企业开工。十一所大学、十七所工业学校、三十四所学校已经开办或准备开办。全市重建了二十一万平方公尺的住宅。
    △全欧洲最大的德聂伯水电站，已有三座大涡轮开动，第四座正在装置。阿塞拜疆横跨库拉河的巨大水闸正建筑中，将以动力供给巴库油田，并灌溉七七○公里的土地。哈萨克斯坦首都阿尔马阿塔附近波尔辛亚河上连续十二座水电站，已修到第七座。乌兹别克悉尔达亚河上大电力站工程，已移土一千六百万立方公尺，并竖立起全部骨架，两个滑轮已经发电。
    △乌克兰机器制造工业的生产，比去年增加百分之七十。全部乌克兰在战时被毁的工厂都已重新开工。
