　　Kaifeng Front Two Brotherly Units
    Supporting Each Other to Defeat the Enemy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 4th] Frontline reporters report: In the Kaifeng campaign, two brotherly units of the People's Liberation Army automatically supported each other on the battlefield, demonstrating the great spirit of coordinated action, unity, and fraternity. On the night of June 18th, when a certain unit's assault team bravely broke into the South Gate of Kaifeng first, its follow-up troops failed to keep up. The unit persisted in its captured position and fought alone for seven hours. After learning that a certain battalion of another brotherly unit that had broken in from Songmen, quickly decided to resolutely establish contact with the brotherly unit at all costs. On their way forward, the Huiji River blocked their path, and the bridge was already sealed off by the enemy's intensive artillery fire. But the battalion disregarded everything and forcibly crossed the Huiji River. After crossing the river, they were in a dangerous situation with their backs to the river and facing enemies on three sides. The enemy's fierce artillery fire destroyed their temporary fortifications, and the houses that provided cover were also set on fire. But the steel-like soldiers still rushed through numerous obstacles, risking their lives, to continue their attack forward. Meng Jiqing, the platoon deputy of the sixth company, led the troops at the forefront, holding a hand grenade in one hand and a whistle in the other, blowing the whistle while fighting, to contact the brotherly unit. They searched tirelessly for a long time, and finally heard a answering whistle near a Kuomintang army warehouse. At this time, the soldiers' excitement was beyond description. They pounced on the enemy even more bravely. Finally, the enemy was caught in a pincer attack and collapsed. The two brotherly units then merged together and continued to kill the enemy in the central area of ​​Kaifeng City shoulder to shoulder.

　　开封前线两支兄弟部队
    相互应援打垮敌军
    【新华社开封前线四日电】前线记者报导：开封战役中，解放军某两支兄弟部队在战场上自动相互应援，发扬了协同动作、团结友爱的伟大精神。六月十八日夜，当某部突击队首先英勇突进开封南门时，其后续部队未能紧接跟进。该部坚持既得阵地，孤军奋战达七小时。由宋门突入的另一支兄弟部队某营得悉后，即迅速决定不惜用任何代价坚决与兄弟部队打通联系。在他们前进途中，惠济河挡住了去路，桥也早为敌人密集的炮火所封锁。但该营不顾一切强渡过惠济河。过河后他们又处于一面背河，三面临敌的危境。敌人猛烈的炮火把他们临时筑成的工事摧毁了，赖以隐蔽的房子也着了火。但钢铁般的战士们，仍然奋不顾身冲过重重障碍继续向前进攻。六连一排副孟纪清带领部队走在最前面，他一手握着手榴弹，一手拿着哨子，一面打一面吹，向兄弟部队进行联络。他们毫不灰心的寻找了很久，终于在蒋匪军用仓库附近听到了回答的哨音。这时战士们的兴奋是无法形容的。他们更勇猛的向敌人扑去。终于敌人遭受到两面夹击。纷纷溃退；两支兄弟部队随即汇合在一起，并肩向开封城中心区的敌人继续杀去。
