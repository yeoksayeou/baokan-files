　　Our Army Closely Besieges Changchun
    Continuously Defeating Chiang Bandit Raids
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th] The People's Liberation Army, closely besieging Changchun, has continuously defeated small groups of Chiang's troops attempting to raid, tightly compressing the enemy within their strongholds. On the 3rd, a unit of the enemy's New 38th Division raided Dingjia Wopeng, about five miles south of Changchun. The leading scout squad of five men surrendered to us, and the remaining enemy was beaten back. On the 4th, two battalions of the enemy's Security Brigade raided Songjia Wazi, northeast of Changchun, and were routed. We killed or wounded over sixty enemy soldiers, including company and platoon leaders. On the 6th, the enemy's New 7th Army, New 38th Division, attacked Shihugou and Luyuan, southwest of Changchun, and we killed or wounded 158 enemy soldiers, capturing 16 alive. We seized one 60mm mortar, five light and heavy machine guns, and twenty-eight rifles.
