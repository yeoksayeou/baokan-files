Xinhua News Agency, Jinpu Front, 21st. The People's Liberation Army made full preparations before attacking Yanzhou. On July 7th, the "East China Front" newspaper of the Shandong Corps Political Department published an editorial calling on all units attacking Yanzhou to "be brave and resourceful, integrate military and political affairs, resolutely annihilate the enemy, and capture Yanzhou." The leaders of a certain unit issued a letter to all commanders and fighters, calling on everyone to strive for the glorious titles of "Yanzhou Battle Merit Company" and "Yanzhou Hero." On the 8th, a certain division held a determination meeting of cadres at the battalion level and above, pointing out that all conditions for the liberation of Yanzhou had been met. The division commander also expressed his determination at the meeting. The regimental and battalion commanders of the division personally went to the main attack troops to mobilize, discuss, and guide the siege operations. Many companies asked their superiors to give them the main attack or commando mission, and launched mutual challenges. The Second Company of a certain regiment proposed competition conditions to the Seventh Company, including "Mass discipline should achieve four nos: no wandering thoughts, no wandering eyes, no itchy hands, no greedy mouths," etc. The Seventh Company's letter of challenge added the "four fasts" conditions for military actions, namely: "Fast continuous blasting. Fast bridge and ladder erection. Fast ladder climbing to the city, and fast development upon city entry." In addition, various units and arms scheduled to perform different tasks held joint meetings, or wrote letters and visited each other to ensure coordinated actions. Director Jiang of a certain artillery unit led more than ten cadres to visit the infantry units undertaking the main attack, held a step-artillery coordination meeting, introduced the experience of step-artillery coordination during the liberation of Weixian, the performance and power of various cannons, and how to cooperate with infantry actions, greatly enhancing the infantry's confidence in attacking strongholds. Many commanders and fighters have made personal plans, and cooks and health workers are no exception. Subsequently, various units launched a wave of military learning. The Second Battalion headquarters of a certain unit made a large sand table operation on a 100-square-meter site, and convened various shooters and combat squad leaders and above of the entire battalion to conduct research. Then, each platoon also conducted sand table operations to study tactics. Xie Yucheng, a liberated fighter who had worked on fortifications in Yanzhou, specially introduced to everyone everything he was familiar with. When discussing, the Third Platoon of the Sixth Company first mobilized everyone to raise concerns and difficulties, and then studied ways to overcome them. The entire Eighth Company learned to climb soft ladders and build bridges, and the speed was three times faster than before.

　　军政结合深入动员
  　攻兖战斗前准备充分
    【新华社津浦前线二十一日电】进攻兖州的解放军在战前曾作充分准备。七月七日，山东兵团政治部“华东前线”报即发表社论，号召攻兖各部“勇敢机智，军政结合，坚决歼灭敌人，打下兖州”。某部首长发布了告全体指战员书，号召大家争取“兖州战功连”，“兖州英雄”等光荣称号。某师于八日召开营以上干部的决心大会，指出解放兖州已具备一切条件。师长并在会上表达了自己的决心。该师各团营长则亲自到主攻部队去动员、讨论、指导攻城作业。许多连队都要求上级给予主攻或突击任务，并展开互相挑战。某团二连向七连提出竞赛条件有“群众纪律做到四不：心不想、眼不花、手不痒、嘴不馋”等条。七连的应战书又加上军事动作的“四快”条件，即：“连续爆破快。架桥架梯快。爬梯登城快，登城发展快”。此外，预定担任不同任务的各单位，各兵种又举行联合会议，或互相写信、访问，保证协同动作。某炮兵部队姜主任率领十余干部访问担任主攻的各步兵部队，举行步炮协同会议，介绍了解放潍县时步炮协同的经验，各种炮的性能威力及如何配合步兵动作，大大增强了步兵攻坚的信心。许多指战员都纷纷订出个人计划，炊事员、保健员也无例外。各部接着展开了军事学习热潮。某部二营营部在一百平方公尺的场地上做了一个大沙盘作业，召集全营各种射击手和战斗小组长以上干部进行研究。然后各排也进行了沙盘作业，研究战术。过去曾在兖州做过工事的解放战士谢玉成并专门向大家介绍了他所熟悉的一切情况。六连三排在讨论时，首先发动大家提顾虑、提困难，再研究克服办法。八连全连都学会爬软梯、架桥、速度比过去快三倍。
