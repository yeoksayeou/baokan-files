　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, 25th -- The international espionage case endangering the liberated areas, cracked by our Jizhong District Public Security Bureau at the Zhangjia Village Catholic Church in Xianxian County on October 21st of last year (details in the telegram from this agency on May 7th of this year), has now been tried and formally adjudicated on July 15th. The main culprits in the case, Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Li Shitang, and Mu Qihua, were sentenced to expulsion from China, while Jia Shushan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years. After the criminals were arrested by our public security organs last year, the Jizhong Public Security Bureau transferred all the criminals and evidence to the Jizhong Branch of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Higher Court. After meticulous investigation by Prosecutor Lu Zhiguo, a formal public prosecution was filed on June 29th. The court formally opened the trial on July 1st. Investigative hearings were held for four days from the 1st to the 4th, presided over by Judge Xu Yunhui. Deliberative hearings were held for three days from the 6th to the 8th, presided over by a collegiate bench composed of Presiding Judge Wang Feiran and Judges Xu Yunhui and Zhang Jingshan. Both sessions were held from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM. During the trial, 35 people, including Chinese and foreign clergy and nuns from the Zhangjia Village Catholic Church in Xianxian County, as well as representatives from various regions, were present to observe. The debate concluded at 7:00 PM on the 8th. Because the evidence of the crimes committed by the criminals was conclusive, they all confessed to the crimes. At 5:30 PM on July 15th, Presiding Judge Wang Feiran formally announced the verdict. The original text of the main verdict is as follows: "Shang Jianxun (French), Pan Rulin (French), Li Shitang (Belgian), and Mu Qihua (French) privately established a radio station to provide intelligence to Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S.; moreover, Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, and Mu Qihua colluded with the Chiang bandit army to attack the liberated areas, all are expelled from China. Jia Shushan (from Renqiu, Jizhong) incited soldiers and young adults to desert and provided intelligence to Pan Rulin, sentenced to one year of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years. Liao Ya'er, She Yuren, Shen Zitian, Wu Huaichi, and Du Ande and other accomplices will be investigated separately. A Haller shortwave transmitter and a shortwave receiver, as well as multiple U.S.-made radio parts and seven batteries, are all confiscated." The verdict also stipulates that if the criminals are not satisfied, they may appeal. If no appeal is filed within the deadline, our democratic government will execute the judgment in accordance with the verdict.
    Attached is the original indictment filed by Lu Zhiguo, Deputy Director and Prosecutor of the Jizhong Public Security Bureau, to the Jizhong Branch of the Jin-Cha-Ji Higher Court:
    Indictment by the Deputy Director and Prosecutor of the Public Security Bureau of the Jizhong Administrative Office.

Liao Ya'er, male, 44 years old, French national, Deputy President of the Jesuit Society of the Xianxian District of the Catholic Church, at large.

Wu Huaichi, male, 42 years old, native of Hejian, Hebei, Father of the Bishop's Residence of the Xianxian Diocese of the Catholic Church, at large. The above defendants, on the grounds of acting as spies for Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S., colluding with the Chiang bandit army, and endangering the liberated areas, have been investigated by this prosecutor, who believes that a public prosecution should be filed. The criminal facts and evidence are listed below:
    Criminal Facts:
    The defendant Shang Jianxun and others have long been under the protection of our democratic government, engaging in religious activities. However, they have harbored deep hostility and animosity towards the military and civilians of our liberated areas, willingly acting as spies and special agents for Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S., colluding with the Chiang bandit army to endanger the liberated areas. They have also used the guise of propagating religion to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities, determined to destroy our liberated areas before they would be satisfied. The crimes committed by the defendants are listed below:
    (1) Secretly establishing a radio station and using various methods to supply intelligence to Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. intelligence personnel stationed in Peiping and Tianjin: Since the Japanese surrender, and the arrival of Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. troops in Peiping and Tianjin, the defendant Shen Zitian first established a relationship with U.S. military intelligence personnel stationed in Tianjin in the autumn of 1945. Later, the defendants Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Mu Qihua and others also accepted the intelligence mission of Mao De, a U.S. liaison officer stationed in Tianjin in January 1946. The defendant She Yuren established a relationship with Chiang Kai-shek's special agent Lei Minggeng (also known as Er Lei) in May 1946, and passed the obtained intelligence to Chiang Kai-shek through Er Lei. The defendants Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Mu Qihua, and Li Shitang secretly established a transceiver in December 1945 and January 1946, which was installed and used by Li Shitang, using the call sign "MS" and wavelengths of 40 and 80 meters to communicate with the "GD" call sign of the Tianjin radio station. All intelligence was then transferred by the defendant Liao Ya'er, who was stationed in Peiping and Tianjin, to U.S. intelligence personnel stationed in Peiping and Tianjin (sometimes through U.S. military priests). Since the installation of the radio station, the military and political situation of the liberated areas has been continuously reported. For example, before each battle, the movements of our troops and stretchers, the participation of the people in the army and troop training, as well as the location and direction of the rear agencies, were all telegraphed in a timely manner. When the Jizhong Bank Printing Factory moved its location in November 1946, the defendants immediately telegraphed the report.
    In addition to providing intelligence via radio station, the defendants also continuously provided reports orally or in writing. For example, the defendant Shang Jianxun made several reports to Mao De in person in February of that year after accepting the intelligence mission in January 1946. He also recommended She Yuren, whom he considered to be the most knowledgeable about the liberated areas and the Chinese Communist Party, to Mao De. As a result, the defendant She Yuren went to Tianjin every two or three months under the pretext of buying medicine to give reports in person. In June 1946, Shang Jianxun went to Europe on business, and Pan Rulin was responsible for the intelligence work. After Pan Rulin discussed and strengthened the intelligence work with Liao Ya'er, it was stipulated that intelligence would be sent to Tianjin every half month. In addition to oral intelligence, Shang Jianxun, She Yuren, Shen Zitian, Du Ande, Pan Rulin and others also provided written intelligence. The above intelligence was highly valued by Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. In particular, the intelligence written by Shen Zitian on the location, number, and equipment of the People's Liberation Army was rewarded with 20 U.S. dollars. She Yuren's intelligence written to Chiang Kai-shek also received praise in a reply from Lei Minggeng. The intelligence written by the defendant Pan Rulin, which was more than 30 pages long, was even more detailed and was described by himself as an "encyclopedia of the liberated areas." In addition, the defendant Wu Huaichi wrote a manuscript on the party, government, military, and economic aspects of the liberated areas, which was extremely slanderous and disparaging. The material was written from the winter of 1946 and was completed in the spring of the following year with the help of She Yuren, Jia Shushan, and Pan Rulin. Except for a part that was seized by us, the remaining part was taken to Tianjin by She Yuren.
    (2) Colluding with the Chiang bandit army to harass the liberated areas and inciting soldiers and young people to desert: The defendants Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Mu Qihua, and Liao Ya'er held a meeting on January 4, 1946, and decided that Liao Ya'er would go to Peiping in the name of Zhao Zhensheng, the bishop of the Xianxian Diocese, to invite Sun Lianzhong, commander of the 11th War Zone of the Chiang bandit army, to attack the liberated areas, hoping that they would occupy Xianxian and that the defendants would act as internal respondents. Sun replied: "Units have been dispatched to pursue and suppress." In addition, the defendant Jia Shushan once said to eight new soldiers: "You have a good opportunity to escape." He also gave two soldiers who were instigated by him to escape a note to Tianjin to withdraw money, and advised them to find work there. He also gave a new soldier a letter of introduction so that someone would take care of him in Tianjin after he deserted. In total, the defendants directly or indirectly incited more than 80 soldiers and young people to desert.
    The Xianxian Public Security Bureau discovered the crimes committed by the defendants endangering the liberated areas in October 1947, and then arrested Shang Jianxun and others and sent them to this bureau for investigation.
    Evidence:
    The defendants Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Li Shitang, Mu Qihua, and Jia Shushan not only confessed to the above circumstances without denying them, but also had the following seized: Pan Rulin's letter to She Yuren admitting that his intelligence must be praised by the Americans, She Yuren's letter to Er Lei requesting aerial propaganda, Er Lei's letter to She Yuren acknowledging receipt of his intelligence, Mei Huaiyi's notice to Li Shitang to establish contact with Peiping and Tianjin radio stations, with an attached wavelength call sign schedule, and Sun Lianzhong's Xiangzhi No. 322 telegram. In addition, the second half of Wu Huaichi's manuscript slandering the liberated areas is also attached to the file. In addition, a Haller shortwave transmitter and a shortwave receiver, as well as various U.S.-made radio parts and seven batteries, were also seized. This is sufficient proof that the above facts are indeed true.
    In summary, the actions of the defendants are not only a violation of the laws and regulations of our democratic government, but also prohibited by the laws of any country, and a public prosecution should be filed immediately, and a judgment should be made according to law. Furthermore, the five defendants in custody, Shang Jianxun and others, were relatively candid in their confessions during the interrogation and have provided explanations.

    犯罪事实：
    被告尚建勋等，久在我民主政府保护之下，从事宗教事业。但夙对我解放区军民，深抱敌对仇视态度，竟甘当蒋美间谍特务，勾结蒋匪军，危害解放区。并假宣传宗教之名，而实施种种阴谋破坏活动，必欲摧毁我解放区而后甘心。兹将被告等所为罪行，择要列述于后：
    （一）秘密设立电台，并用各种方法以情报供给蒋匪及驻平津美情报人员：自日本投降，蒋美军到达平、津后，被告申自天，于一九四五年秋，首与驻津美军情报人员发生关系。后被告尚建勋、潘汝霖、穆启华等亦于一九四六年一月接受了驻津美联络人员毛德之情报任务。被告佘裕仁，于一九四六年五月，又与蒋匪特务雷鸣庚（又名二雷）发生关系；将所得情报，通过二雷转交蒋匪。被告尚建勋、潘汝霖、穆启华、李诗堂，于一九四五年十二月与一九四六年一月间起，密设收发报机一部，由李诗堂负责装置使用；以“ＭＳ”呼号，四○及八○米的波长，与天津“ＧＤ”呼号之电台，进行联络。所有情报，即由常驻平津之被告廖迓迩转给驻平津之美情报人员（有时通过美随军神甫）。自该电台安设后，即不断报告解放区的军事与政治情况。如历次战役前，我部队与担架之动向，人民参军与部队训练情形，以及后方机关之住地与转移方向等，无不及时电告。冀中银行印刷厂，于一九四六年十一月转移住地时，该被告等亦即去电报告。
    该被告等，除以电台供给情报外，还不断以口头或书面作报告。如被告尚建勋，自一九四六年一月接受情报任务后，曾于当年二月，数度向毛德面作报告。并将他认为最明了解放区及中国共产党情形之佘裕仁，推荐给毛德。于是该被告佘裕仁，每隔两三月，即以买药为名，赴津面作报告。至一九四六年六月，尚建勋因事赴欧，关于情报工作由潘汝霖负责。经潘汝霖与廖迓迩商议，加强情报工作后，规定每半月送津情报一次。该被告等，除口头情报外，尚建勋、佘裕仁、申自天、杜安德、潘汝霖等，更为有书面情报。以上情报，颇受蒋美之重视。尤以申自天所写的关于解放军驻地，数目及装备之情报，曾得二十元美金之奖励。佘裕仁写给蒋匪之情报，亦得雷鸣庚回信之赞扬。被告潘汝霖所写长三十余页之情报更为详尽，曾自称为“解放区百科全书”。此外被告吴怀赤，曾写关于解放区党政军以及经济各方面之稿件一份，极尽诋毁诬蔑之能事。该材料自一九四六年冬写起，经佘裕仁、贾书善、潘汝霖之帮助，于次年春季，始行完成。除一部被我卡获外，其余部分，由佘裕仁带往天津。
    （二）勾结蒋匪军窜扰解放区，并煽惑战士及青年逃亡：被告尚建勋、潘汝霖、穆启华、廖迓迩，于一九四六年一月四日开会，决定由廖迓迩赴平，以献县教区主教赵振声名义邀请蒋匪军第十一战区司令长官孙连仲进攻解放区，冀其窜踞献县，被告等予以内应。孙匪复称：“已酌派部队前往径剿矣”。又被告贾书善，曾对八个新战士说：“你们有相当机会要逃跑”。又给两个被他鼓动逃跑的战士开给到天津支钱的兑条，并劝他们在那边参加工作。又给一个新战士开介绍信，以便开小差后，到天津有人照顾。总计被告等，前后直接间接煽惑战士及青年逃亡者，共计八十余人。
    被告等危害解放区之罪行，经献县公安局于一九四七年十月察觉后，当将尚建勋等逮捕到案，送由本局进行侦查。
    证据：
    被告尚建勋、潘汝霖、李诗堂、穆启华、贾书善，关于上述等情，不惟供认不讳；且经查获有：潘汝霖致佘裕仁自认其情报必为美国人赞许之信，佘裕仁致二雷请求作空中宣传信，二雷复佘裕仁收到其情报之信，梅怀义通知李诗堂建立与平津电台联络之信，并附波长呼号时间表，及孙连仲相智字第三二二号代电等多件。又吴怀赤诋毁诬蔑解放区之稿件后半部一本均附卷。此外并获有哈特来氏发报机及短波收报机各一部，美制无线电零件多种，电池七块。足证上开事实确属实在。
    总核被告等之所为，实不仅违犯我民主政府之法令，亦为任何国家法令所不许，应即提起公诉，请依法审判。另：在押被告尚建勋等五人，在侦讯中，供述尚属坦白，并予说明。
