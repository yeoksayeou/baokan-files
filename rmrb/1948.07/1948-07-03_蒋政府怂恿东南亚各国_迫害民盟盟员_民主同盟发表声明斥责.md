Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Agence France-Presse reports: The China Democratic League issued a statement in Hong Kong on June 26th, denouncing the Kuomintang for instigating the Dutch government to arrest and deport League members Shao Zonghan (editor of the Medan Democratic Daily) and Fei Qingtong (transliteration; Agence France-Presse reported him as Fei Xiaotong's brother, a professor at Tsinghua University) in Sumatra, and for secretly plotting with the Siamese and Malayan authorities to arrest responsible personnel of the Democratic League. The statement appealed to the governments of Southeast Asian countries to protect members of the Democratic League and all democrats who have sought refuge abroad due to persecution by the Kuomintang, and stated that the League would not interfere in the politics of their place of residence, but while respecting the laws of each government, the League reserves the right to conduct patriotic movements to oppose the dictatorial government of China.
