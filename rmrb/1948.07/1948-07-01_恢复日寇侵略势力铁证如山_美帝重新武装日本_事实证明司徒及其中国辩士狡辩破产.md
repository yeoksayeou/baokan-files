Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th – Contrary to the assertions of the likes of Stuart and his Chinese apologists, American imperialism is still actively re-arming Japan and restoring Japanese militarism. According to an expert familiar with the situation in Japan, who recently returned from Japan to the Shandong liberated area via Qingdao: MacArthur Headquarters has recently established an organization similar to the former Japanese military headquarters, abbreviated as "ZEF," ostensibly to organize the police, but in reality, it is secretly responsible for recruiting, training, and arming the Japanese army. Japanese who are now enlisting under the guise of police are required to serve for five years, and are trained in units of battalions, with 700 to 900 men per battalion. It is expected that 300 battalions will be completed by the end of 1949. Tokyo Japanese rumors say that MacArthur Headquarters plans to use this force to establish several U.S.-Japanese mixed brigades, that is, each brigade consists of five Japanese battalions and one American battalion, plus some artillery, tanks, and other special forces staffed exclusively by American troops. The expert also said that "ZEF" is also implementing a three-year plan to rebuild Japanese military bases, attempting to rebuild Japanese naval bases and construct several heavy bomber airfields, military warehouses, barracks, and military highways within the next three years. Such huge military warehouses have already been established in the Tokyo area and on Kyushu Island. Other work in the plan is being carried out by the U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan, who are forcing Japanese workers, farmers, and intellectuals to build them. However, it is heard that the general Japanese people are not as enthusiastic about this as the United States hopes. Japanese people in Kyushu and Hokkaido often engage in slowdowns and strikes. Japanese engineers and technicians also refuse to participate in such military construction projects.

Note: According to an article titled "The Revival of Militaristic Japan" published in the 12th issue of the 17th volume of "World Knowledge" in Shanghai: According to official figures, Japan currently has 30,000 regular police officers, 95,000 autonomous police officers, and about 8,000 more were added in May of this year, for a total of 133,000. At the same time, under the pretext of "dealing with riots," it is said that they are planning to increase the number to 300,000. Before the war, the Japanese army's standing army was only 230,000. The planned 300,000 armed police are equivalent to the total number of standing army police before the war. The highest institution currently commanding the Japanese police is the "National Security Committee," which is directly under the Prime Minister and is actually a disguised Ministry of the Army. The "police control districts" in various places are disguised "military control districts." The Police Administration University, established on May 1 of this year, is a disguised Army University or Officer Candidate School. Therefore, the Japanese army will soon restore its pre-war troop strength, equipment, and organization. According to a statement issued earlier this month by 291 prominent figures from all walks of life in China protesting the United States' support of Japan: many former Japanese military cadres have now become police officers or are lurking in military-organized development groups. The number of police officers has gradually increased from 65,000 before the war to 125,000, and is actually said to have reached 300,000. The number of firearms was originally one for every five people, but now it is planned to change to one for each person. Ashida has recently used the pretext of preparing for the occurrence of a national emergency to establish a special training unit. These materials can corroborate and supplement the above-mentioned expert's remarks. The "police" of the 300 battalions that MacArthur plans to complete by the end of 1949, as mentioned by a certain expert, will total approximately 210,000 to 270,000 people at that time, which is not far from the number of 300,000 mentioned in these materials.

### 恢复日寇侵略势力铁证如山　美帝重新武装日本  事实证明司徒及其中国辩士狡辩破产

　　恢复日寇侵略势力铁证如山
    美帝重新武装日本
    事实证明司徒及其中国辩士狡辩破产
    【新华社山东二十九日电】与司徒雷登辈及其中国辩护士们的断言相反，美帝国主义仍在积极重新武装日本，恢复日本军国主义。据由青岛来山东解放区的一位新从日本返国，熟悉该国情况的专家谈：麦克阿瑟总部近已设置一类似过去日本军部之机构，简称为“ＺＥＦ”，借口组织警察，实则秘密担任征召、编训、与武装日本陆军的职务。现在以警察名义入伍的日人，规定服役期为五年，以营为单位进行训练，每营七百至九百人，预期一九四九年底将完成三百个营。东京日人传说，麦克阿瑟总部计划将来以此种武力建立若干美日混成旅，即每一旅由五个日本营及一个美国营组成，另附以若干专由美军担任的炮兵、战车及其他特种部队。该专家又称，“ＺＥＦ”还正在实行另一个重建日本军事基地的三年计划，企图在今后三年之内，重建日本各海军基地，并修建若干重轰炸机机场、军事仓库、兵营及适于军用之公路等。此类巨大军事仓库，已在东京一带及九州岛上建立。计划中之其他工作，亦正由美驻日军事当局强迫日本工人农民以及知识分子为其兴建。但闻日本一般人民对此并不如美国所希望的积极，九州与北海道的日人且经常进行怠工、罢工。日本工程师及技师亦有拒绝参加此类军事建筑计划者。
    按：据上海“世界知识”十七卷十二期刊载“军国日本的复活”一文称：日本现有警察依官方数字为正规警察三万名，自治警察九万五千名，本年五月约增八千名，共十三万三千名，同时借口“应付暴动”，据说又要计划增加到三十万名。战前日本陆军常备军不过二十三万名。计划中的三十万名武装警察，即已相当于战前常备军警的总和。现在指挥日警的最高机构，为直辖首相之“国家保安委员会”，实为变相的陆军省。各地的“警管区”，则为变相的“军管区”，本年五月一日成立的警政大学，就是变相的陆军大学或士官学校。故日本陆军不久就要恢复到战前的兵额、装备和组织。又据本月初中国各界名流二百九十一人抗议美国扶植日本的声明称：前日本军事干部，现多变为警察或潜伏于军事编制的开拓团中。警察人数已由战前之六万五千，陆续扩充至十二万五千，实际据说已到三十万。枪支原本五人一支，现拟改为每人一支。芦田近又借口准备国家非常状态发生，将成立特别训练部队。这些材料，与上述某专家谈话可以互相印证补充。某专家所谈麦克阿瑟计划于一九四九年底完成三百个营的“警察”，其总人数届时约为二十一万至二十七万人，与这些材料中所称三十万人之数已相差不远。
