　　【Taiyue Telegraph】On the first day of our march into Jinzhong, we saw streets in a certain town in ×× County filled with rows of lacquered chests, cabinets, and furniture, stretching continuously for more than eighty li to Songshudian. A landlord in Mianshang Village told me that these pieces of furniture were brought by refugees who had fled from Pingyao and Jiexiu in the past. They were forced to flee into the mountains by Yan Xishan, using chests to exchange for food. There were over two hundred refugees living here, and they had been waiting for our troops for a long time. During a night march to a ridge thirty li away from Pingyao, in the clear moonlight, we could clearly see groups of villagers around us, carrying pots, leading donkeys, and pulling their children, happily following the troops home. They shouted along the way, "Make way, let our troops pass first!" They also comforted their children, saying, "Our troops are here, they will drive away the Gouzi troops (referring to Yan's bandits), and we can eat noodles when we go home."
　　When the troops arrived at a large courtyard in Caozigou, two old men came out to complain, saying, "The Gouzi (Yan's bandits) came this morning to rob grain and cotton. Look at what they have done to our homes! It's so good that our troops have arrived." When the troops arrived at Liangjiatan, an old lady, upon seeing the troops, immediately said, "You've finally come! The people have been thinking about the troops so much that they're almost going crazy. The wheat isn't even fully ripe, but the Gouzi township government has already assigned grain quotas. My family can harvest three shi, but the Gouzi has assigned three shi and five." She eagerly wanted the troops to go to her house. Before even entering the gate, she anxiously told her daughter-in-law, "Prepare to harvest the wheat tomorrow, our troops are here!" She then muttered to herself, "We still have to steal to harvest our own wheat, the Gouzi are really killing people." Yan's bandits had issued an order here that anyone who harvested wheat privately would be beheaded. An old man in Yanjinggou was beheaded for harvesting wheat on his own land, and his head was displayed as a warning.
　　When the troops attacked the Duling stronghold, there were four to five hundred villagers inside who had been captured by Yan's bandits. Yan's bandits forced them to be the vanguard, but they risked life and limb to run over to our side. They were all sallow and emaciated, and said to the soldiers as if seeing their own family, "If you had attacked a few days later, we would have starved to death!" After the battle was resolved, the rooms and courtyards were filled with people, all vying to see that "Major General Commander Xu Ziliang." Several old men requested the soldiers, "Give us more victories to vent our hatred!" Villagers from Xialing said, "These guys (Yan's army) have raped all our young women, beaten people, robbed grain, and conscripted soldiers. They have really made people suffer." They insisted on taking the prisoners, but the soldiers explained to them that they should be treated according to the policy on prisoners of war. Only then did they give up.
　　As the troops advanced towards Jiexiu, the roadside was filled with yellow wheat fields as far as the eye could see. Many people are now harvesting wheat in the fields, and they smiled happily as they watched the troops pass.
　　【Beiyue News】On July 9th, the Yan bandit security police brigade stationed in Donghuangshui, Yangqu Third District, was routed by our main force. The bandit battalion commander led fifty men and attempted to flee to Fanzhuang. They were intercepted by our local militia, who wounded two enemies, seized three light cannons, four rifles, and twenty-one grenades. The enemy scattered in a panic.

　　多打胜仗出出恨气！
  　晋中群众热爱我军
    【太岳电】我们向晋中进军的头一天，看见××县某镇街上摆满了一列列的油漆箱柜家具，一直到松树店八十多里的路上，连绵不断。绵上村一位房东告诉我说：这些家具都是过去从平遥、介休逃来的难民带来的。他们叫阎锡山逼得没法，跑上山来拿箱子换粮食，这里就住着二百多难民，他们已经等咱队伍好长时间了。夜行军到离平遥三十里的一个山岭上，清亮的月光下清晰的可以看到我们行列的前后左右都是三五成群的老乡，他们担着锅子，赶着毛驴，拉着孩子，高兴的跟着队伍回家。他们一路上叫喊着：“让开路，让咱的队伍先走。”还不时的安慰自己的孩子道：“咱的队伍来了，把勾子军（指阎匪）打走了，咱回家就能吃面啦”。
    队伍到了草子沟一所大院里，两个老汉出来诉苦，他说：“勾子（阎匪）今天清早还来抢粮食棉花，你看家里被翻腾成个啥啦！咱队伍来的可好。”队伍到了梁家滩，一位老太太见了部队，头一句就说：“你们可来了，老百姓想着队伍都快想疯了。麦子还没黄透，勾子乡公所就派下粮来，我家能收三石，勾子就派了三石五。”她争着要队伍到她家去，还没进大门，她就着急的告诉她媳妇说：“明天准备割麦吧，咱的队伍来啦！”她又自言自语道：“自家的麦还得偷着割，勾子真把人害死啦。”阎匪在这里下过命令，谁家要私自割麦，就要杀头。阎井沟就有个老汉因为上自己地割麦子被砍了头，还号令示众。
    队伍打都岭据点时，里面有被阎匪抓去的四五百老乡，阎匪强迫他们当头阵，但他们却冒着枪林弹雨跑过来了。他们一个个都是面黄饥瘦，象见了亲人似的对战士们说：“你们再迟打几天，我们就饿死了！”战斗解决以后，房里院里都挤满了人，争着要那位“少将司令徐子良”，有几个老汉向战士们要求：“给我们多打几个胜仗，出出恨气！”下岭老乡说：“这些家伙（阎军）把我们年轻女人都强奸遍了，打人、抢粮、抓兵，真把人害苦了。”他们一定要求把俘虏交给他们，但战士们给他们解释了应当按俘虏政策对待。他们才不要了。
    队伍向介休挺进时，沿路上一片黄麦田，一眼看不到边，现在很多人正在地里割麦，他们看着队伍走过，都高兴的笑了。
    【北岳讯】七月九日，驻阳曲三区东黄水之阎匪保警大队。经我主力击溃后，匪营长带领五十余人，企图往范庄逃跑。中途被我当地民兵阻击，计伤敌二名，缴获轻炮三门，步枪四支，手榴弹二十一个，敌仓慌四散。
