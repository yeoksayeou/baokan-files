　　Amidst the June Price Storm
    Rice-grabbing Spree Erupts in Wuxi
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th】Wuxi, known as one of China's four major rice markets, erupted in a rice-grabbing spree on the 25th. According to Reuters and Associated Press dispatches from Shanghai on the 26th: The rice riot occurred on the evening of the same day when the rice price in Wuxi soared to 20 million Jiang coins per dan. "The rioters robbed rice from house to house, so that no rice shop was spared" (Reuters). The Jiang government then ordered armed police and military police to carry out bloody suppression. Two impoverished people were seriously wounded by gunfire; more than 60 others were arrested. As of the morning of the 26th, all rice shops in Wuxi remained tightly closed, and transactions of cotton, cloth, and cotton yarn had also come to a standstill. Note: Wuxi is the fifth city in the Jiang area to experience rice riots amidst the June price storm, following similar disturbances in Wujin, Ningbo, Chongqing, and Taixian.

　　六月物价风暴中
    无锡爆发抢米潮
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】向称中国四大米市之一的无锡，于二十五日爆发抢米风潮。据廿六日路透社及美联社沪电消息：米骚动系于是日晚当无锡米价暴涨至每担蒋币二千万元时发生，“骚动者逐家抢米，以致所有米店无一幸免”（路透社）。蒋政府当命令武装警察、宪兵实行血腥镇压，贫民二人被射击重伤；另有六十余人被捕，迄二十六日晨无锡所有米店仍紧关店门，棉花、布匹、棉纱的交易也告停顿。按：无锡为蒋区六月物价风暴中发生米骚动的第五个城市，前此骚动曾在武进、宁波、重庆、泰县相继发生。
