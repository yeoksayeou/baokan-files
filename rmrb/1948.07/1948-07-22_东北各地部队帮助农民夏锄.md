Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: As the summer weeding season nears its end in Northeast China, second-line corps of the various military regions in North Manchuria have been dispatched to help the local people dig trenches and rush to weed. The Songjiang Military Region mobilized 8,000 soldiers, led by military and political cadres at all levels, to assist the people of Lalin and Shuangcheng counties in urgently digging ditches to prevent summer floods. The trench-digging troops provided their own firewood, grain, vegetables, and some transportation and labor tools. The plan is to first dig a main line in both Lalin and Shuangcheng; it is stipulated that each officer and soldier must dig at least 1.5 cubic meters per day. After 20 days, over 10,000 hectares of good farmland seedlings can be saved. The unit also expects to complete the four main lines in the area, requiring a total of 600,000 workdays, which will enable 60,000 hectares of good farmland to avoid waterlogging disasters for several years. The Nenjiang Military Region Party Committee also issued instructions, mobilizing troops to go to the countryside to help the people rush to weed and plow. A certain unit of the military region has now set off to a certain area to help military families and the poor weed. A company of a certain cavalry regiment, led by the company commander, helped Dagang Village rush to plant more than 300 hectares of flooded land. From the 21st of last month, all units of the Hegang Military Region suspended training and went to the countryside for a week to help the people with summer weeding. A unit of over a thousand people from the military region went to Sujia'an and other areas of Huachuan County, which were severely hit by hail, to help the people weed. The enthusiasm of the troops is as high as when they are training.
