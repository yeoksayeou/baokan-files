　　　　　Our shortcomings and mistakes
    Nevertheless, we are not unaware of our own shortcomings and mistakes. As students of Lenin and Stalin, we engage in self-criticism of our work.
    The Central Committee, at its last meeting, pointed out the shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party, its various departments, and the Party members who hold responsible positions with the trust of the masses.
    The root of these errors lies in the fact that the Central Committee itself recognized the nature and scale of the sudden changes in the international situation too late, especially the nature and scale of the resurgence of imperialist and anti-democratic forces under the leadership of the United States and for the benefit of the United States, and its clear elucidation was also too late.
    Therefore, we did not, from the outset, emphasize with all necessary force that our exclusion from the government was due to the orders of the American reactionaries, and our exposed weaknesses gave Blum and Ramadier an opportunity to exploit. They wanted people to believe that the differences between us were merely on the issue of wages and prices, and we enabled them to present the excuse of merely excluding us from the government as the most important issue.
    On the other hand, we exposed that our exclusion from the government was contrary to the laws of parliamentary democracy (in fact, this is a new symbol of the crisis of bourgeois democracy. When the working class can utilize bourgeois democracy, the capitalists immediately abandon it). This approach was correct, but we gave the impression that it was just a more or less general cabinet crisis. In reality, it was the American imperialists interfering in France's internal affairs.
    Following this initial mistake, we did not relentlessly expose the behavior of the Socialist Party leaders and other parties in the government from the outset, regarding it as a blatant and despicable act, a shameful betrayal of national interests.
    As a result, our delegation in the National Assembly showed hesitation and wavering, which was criticized at the last meeting of the Central Committee. We abstained from voting, instead of firmly voting against, certain government proposals (such as measures for farmers and the status of Algeria). We did not sufficiently criticize the Debré-Barach election law for municipal authorities because we had illusions about certain individuals or certain groups, without considering the new situation in the world and in France.
    There was a time when the Party seemed hesitant in opposing a government that was severely neglecting national interests. We seemed to be influenced by the laments of the Socialist Party and others who blamed us for "undermining the opportunity to obtain American credit, thereby harming the country." In short, they blamed us for not taking actions that patriots should take. In fact, on this issue and others, only we took an attitude that was absolutely in line with the interests of France, and only we took actions that were filled with a patriot's love for our country.
    The hesitation of the Central Committee and the parliamentary delegation, to a certain extent, hindered the rapid mobilization of the working masses and the democratic people to oppose the Ramadier government and its disastrous policies, and contributed to the opportunist tendencies that the Central Committee had criticized last month, which were manifested in underestimating the strength of the working class and fearing mass movements.
    Our September resolution stated: The responsibility of communists "is to firmly lead mass movements, to be bold, and to have a responsible spirit." The Communist Party has the mission of initiating, educating, and leading the movement of the working class and the laboring masses.
    　　　　The experience of the Popular Front
    Here, we should ask ourselves: Have we learned lessons from past experiences, thereby benefiting the Party and the working class, and earnestly educating our cadres? For example, have we fully and clearly pointed out to the Party and the masses the shortcomings of the Popular Front and the reasons for its eventual collapse, in order to avoid repeating them?
    The Popular Front was initiated by us, and it was quite successful and had its positive achievements, but its main shortcoming was that it became a simple agreement between leaders. We proposed establishing democratically elected Popular Front committees in factories and regions, and we proposed convening a national congress, with representatives elected by people's councils at the grassroots level, and with the national congress electing a National Assembly and tasking it with supervising the implementation of the Popular Front program. In many factories and regions, Popular Front committees were elected, but we failed to curb the Socialist Party and our other collaborators from insisting on opposing democratically elected committees and the convening of a national congress with supreme power. The Socialist Party and the Radical Party gradually removed the content of the Popular Front's struggle for bread, freedom, and peace.
    We absorbed certain individuals, such as Daladier and Flandin, into the Popular Front according to the sole formula of "agreement between leaders." Their only purpose was to betray us at the first opportunity. This is why the Popular Front did not have the strength to oppose "non-interventionism," this is why the Popular Front could not prevent the betrayal of Munich. "Non-interventionism" was precisely initiated by Blum and the Socialist Party, and the betrayal of Munich was done by Daladier with the approval of the Socialist Party leaders. This is also why the Popular Front slowly disintegrated and completely collapsed as the war approached.
    　　　　The experience in the Resistance Movement
    We said and repeated these things as early as before 1939. Did we apply these experiences when we organized and led the Resistance? It must be admitted that we did not do so.
    We were the first to resist, and for a considerable period, we were the only ones resisting. As far as we are concerned, the Resistance did not begin on June 18, 1940 (note: the day after France surrendered to Germany in World War II). It began long ago when the working class and republicans (such as the General Confederation of Labor and the League for the Defense of Human Rights) opposed non-interventionism, and later opposed Munich. During the dark period of the "Phony War" (note: referring to the early stages of the European War, when the British and French reactionaries tried to get the German army to attack the Soviet Union to the east, so there were no actual military actions with Germany for a long time, while domestically, the French government declared the French Communist Party illegal.), when Daladier and Bonnet, with the help of the Socialist Party, attacked our Party, split the trade unions, and destroyed our fighters, clearing the way for Hitler's troops, we carried out the French Resistance movement. We were the first to conduct the struggle for the independence and revival of France domestically. At that time, all other parties collapsed in shame and confusion.
    From the first few months of 1941, the French people, regardless of political opinions and beliefs, joined the National Front committees, which were organized in factories or on a regional basis, or on the basis of professional activities, in diverse and flexible forms. Later, they were organized into "French Partisans" and squads of Free Shooters. In the National Front committees or the squads of Partisans, Socialists, Catholics, and Communists did not represent their own parties or beliefs; they participated here as people who were firmly opposed to the German aggressors and the Vichy traitors. This approach was correct, and we can say that the National Front made a great contribution to the cause of liberation. Because the National Front took root among the people, it was the only resistance movement that stood its ground in the struggle.
    Unfortunately, we later agreed to the organization of the "National Council of Resistance," which was not formed from grassroots committees and military organizations, but by direct representation from various parties and groups, as was done in the past with the Popular Front. This was even more serious because all these parties, except our Party, should bear important responsibility for the disaster of France, and they actually did almost nothing in the Resistance. In fact, these parties and groups, and their representatives who participated in the "National Council of Resistance," were more concerned about the situation in France when it was liberated than about organizing effective struggle against the aggressors. They obtained de Gaulle's approval and, under his guidance, busied themselves with planning their resistance plans, which were not aimed at opposing Germany and Vichy, but at opposing the wishes that the French people were sure to express when they were liberated.
    We must admit that tolerating the same shortcomings that led to the collapse of the Popular Front in the organization of the Resistance was a serious mistake. This shortcoming proved to be equally harmful to the national liberation movement.
    　　　　Our Party must be more oriented towards the masses
    Our conclusion must be this: In order to unite all working people and republicans, to defend their direct interests and freedoms, to resist the new offensive of fascism and to defend the independence of France, we must rely more on the masses. We must remember: the united front is action. Consultations and agreements that can be reached between various parties and groups are only valuable if they can strengthen the actions against the enemies of the people's republic as a result.
    The experience of the National Front can help us discover new forms of action to unite and organize the masses. In many factories in the Paris area, workers have elected committees to defend the Republic. Unite all republicans, communists, socialists, free thinkers, and Catholics on a regional basis to organize such committees to oppose the fascist danger and oppose petty dictators. It is also possible to defend the Constitution approved by the people. Workers and republicans understand that "revising" the Constitution means attacking social legislation and freedoms that benefit the working people and all poor people. De Gaulle wants to abolish various nationalizations and enterprise committees, abolish social insurance, monopolize trade unions, and deprive the working class of its rights, as well as the freedoms of the French people who sacrificed countless heroes to resist aggression.
    The struggle against the American plan to enslave our country and eliminate our national enterprises has been launched well. Actors, musicians, and everyone in the film industry have established a "League to Defend French Cinema." It is foreseeable that alliances based on broad committees will gradually be organized, such as a League to Defend the French Automobile Industry, or organize an alliance with the goal of developing a serious construction plan, uniting small construction companies, construction workers, technicians, residents, people who lost their homes in the bombing, and young couples looking for a place to live, etc.
    The question is to unite all French people who are aware of the danger threatening the Republic and harming the economic and political independence of France. The unity of the working class, the unity between communist and socialist workers, must be the foundation of this broad unity of republicans. But this does not mean that the unity of republicans and patriots must be subordinate to pre-arranged agreements between Socialist Party leaders and Socialist Party groups. Recent events have made it clear to many working people the divisive policies of the Socialist Party leaders. The shameful cooperation between the Gaullists and the Socialist Party in the municipal elections made it clear to the people that the so-called left and right wings have only relative meaning for those who openly unite with the reactionaries.
    　　　　The government our country needs
    It can be seen from de Gaulle's recent declaration that the danger is great. This petty dictator, encouraged and supported by the Socialist Party leaders, has made demands and threatened greatly. It is at this time that Ramadier and Blum are carrying out the division of the working class. They pretend to be simultaneously opposing the Gaullist conspirators and the loyal workers who believe in communism. In reality, the Ramadier government, as it has been doing all along, will fuel the flames of Gaullism and adventurism.
    Only a government that is firmly based on the working masses, a government in which the working class and its Communist Party play a decisive role, can defeat the coup and the imperialist warmongers.
    This will be a government that implements a program that meets the demands of the masses. This government will implement genuine reforms, confiscate French property overseas, and make the rich pay. This government will curb inflation and, first of all, strictly reduce military spending to balance the budget, which can be done as long as the army is reorganized according to democratic principles and the criminal war to attack the Vietnamese people is ended.
    This government will implement cuts in capitalists' profits and curb the rampant rise in prices in order to realize the reasonable demands of the working people.
    This government will do its best to defend the Constitution and the Republic against the Gaullists and the small clique of all conspirators who follow de Gaulle. (End)

　　保卫共和——捍卫我们的民族独立
    （法共总书记多列士于一九四七年十月二十九日对法共中央委员会的报告节要）
  　　　　　我们的缺点和错误
    虽然如此，我们对自己的缺点和错误，不是不认识。我们是列宁和斯大林的学生，我们对自己的工作是进行自我批评的。
    中央委员会在上次开会时曾经指出了党、党的各部门及得到群众信任而担任负责工作的党员们的工作中的缺点和错误。
    这些错误的根源，在于中央委员会本身对国际形势的突然变化之性质及规模，特别是对美国领导下、为了美国利益的帝国主义和反民主力量的重新结合之性质和规模，认识得太迟，明确的阐明也太迟。
    因此，我们没有从开始时起，即用一切必要的力量，强调我们被排斥出政府是由于美国反动派的命令，而我们暴露的弱点，给了勃鲁姆及拉马第以可乘之机。他们是要人们相信我们之间的分歧，仅仅是在关于工资和物价的问题上，我们使他们能够把仅仅是排斥我们出政府的借口，作为最主要的问题。
    另方面，我们揭露了我们之被排斥出政府，是和议会民主的法律相违背的（实在说来，这是资产阶级民主的危机的新象征。当工人阶级能利用资产阶级民主时，资本家们就马上把他抛弃了）。这做法是对的，可是我们却给人这样一种印象，即这不过是或多或少的普遍的内阁危机而已。实际上这是美帝国主义者干涉法国的内政。
    继此最初的错误之后，我们没有一开始就无情的揭露社会党领袖，和政府中其他党派的行为，把它看做是明显的卑鄙的行为，是对民族利益的可耻的背叛。
    结果，我们在国民议会中的党团，表现出犹豫和动摇，这点已在中央委员会上次会议中批评过了。我们弃权而不坚决的对政府的若干建议（如对于农民的措施，及阿尔及利亚的地位）投反对票。我们没有充分抨击德拨勒——巴拉查的市政机关选举法，因为我们对某些个人或某些集团的态度存有幻想，而不考虑到世界的和法国的新形势。
    有一个时候，党似乎在反对严重忽视国家利益的政府中，是犹豫的。我们似乎受了社会党的哀鸣和其他责骂我们“破坏获取美国信用贷款的机会，从而损害及国家”的人们的影响。一句话，他们责骂我们没有采取爱国主义者应有的行动。事实上，在这个问题上和其他问题上一样，只有我们才采取了绝对符合法国利益的态度，也只有我们才采取了爱国主义者热情爱护我们国家的行动。
    中央委员会及议会党团的犹豫，在一定限度内，妨碍了迅速动员工人群众和民主人民，起来反对拉马第政府和它的灾难政策，助长了中央委员会在上个月所指斥的机会主义倾向，这一倾向表现在对工人阶级的力量估计过低和害怕群众运动。
    我们的九月决议中说：共产党人的责任“是坚决的领导群众运动，要放手，要有负责的精神”。共产党有发动教育和领导工人阶级与劳动群众运动的使命。
    　　　　人民阵线的经验
    在这里应该问问自己：我们是否已经从过去的经验中学习到教训，从而使党和工人阶级得到益处，并认真的教育我们的干部？例如，我们曾否充分明确的向党和群众指出人民阵线的缺点，和它最后垮台的原因，以便避免重复呢？
    人民阵线是我们发动的，相当成功，也有其肯定的成就，而其主要的缺点，是它成了简单的领导间的协议。我们曾建议在各工厂及各地区建立民主选举的人民阵线委员会，我们曾建议召开全国代表大会，由基层的人民议会选举代表参加，并由全国代表大会选举出国民议会，赋以监督实行人民阵线纲领的任务。在许多工厂中及各区域内人民阵线委员会已经选出，但是我们对社会党及我们的其他合作者坚持反对民选委员会和最高权力的国民代表大会的召开，未能加以遏制，社会党和急进党，就将人民阵线为面包自由与和平而斗争的内容，逐渐的取消了。
    我们依照“领导间的协议”这个唯一公式，把某些个人如达拉第和法劳也吸收到人民阵线中来了。他们唯一的目的就是一有机会便行出卖。这就是为什么人民阵线竟没有力量反对“不干涉主义”的原因，这就是为什么人民阵线不能够制止慕尼黑的背叛的原因。“不干涉主义”正是由勃鲁姆和社会党发动的，慕尼黑的背叛，正是达拉第得到社会党领袖的赞同而去做的，这也就是为什么人民阵线慢慢的解体而在战争接近时，就完全垮台的原因。
    　　　　抵抗运动中的经验
    早在一九三九年以前，我们就说过和重复的说过这些事情了，在我们组织和领导抗战时我们是否将这些经验运用了呢？必须承认我们并没有这样。
    是我们首先抵抗，而且在相当长的时间我们是唯一的抵抗着。从我们说来，抗战并非开始于一九四○年六月十八日（按为第二次大战中法国向德国投降之翌日），早在工人阶级及共和分子（如总工会及人权保障同盟）反对不干涉主义，和后来反对慕尼黑时就开始了。在“奇怪的战争”（按：指欧洲大战初期，英法反动派亟图使德军东向进攻苏联，因此很久和德国没有实际军事行动，而在国内，法国政府则宣布法共非法。）的黑暗时期，当达拉第及庞纳在社会党帮助之下打击我们党，分裂职工会，摧残我们的战士，为希特勒的军队肃清道路时，我们就进行了法国的抵抗运动。是我们首先在国内进行为法兰西的独立和复兴的斗争。当时一切其他党派都在耻辱和混乱之中崩溃着。
    从一九四一年初几个月起，法国人民不分政治意见和信仰，纷纷参加了民族阵线委员会，这些委员会是在工厂中或是以地区为单位，或是以职业性活动为基础，用多样的和灵活的形式组织起来的。后来他们又组织成“法国游击队”与自由射击手的各小队。在民族阵线委员会或游击队的各小队中，社会党、天主教党和共产党不代表他们自己的政党或信仰，他们在这里是以坚决反对德国侵略者和维希卖国贼的人民的姿态参加的。这办法是对的，我们可以说民族阵线对解放事业尽了极大的贡献。因为民族阵线在人民中生了根，所以他是唯一的斗争中站住了的抵抗运动。
    不幸，我们后来同意“全国抵抗会议”的组织，不从基层的委员会和军事组织产生出来，而由各党各派各集团直接派代表构成，象人民阵线以往的做法一样。因为所有这些政党，除了我们的党之外，对法国的灾难之造成，都应负重要责任，而在抗战中他们实际上几乎什么也没有做，情形就更加严重了。事实上，这些政党和集团以及他们参加“全国抵抗会议”的代表们，对于法国在获得解放时的情形，比对于组织反对侵略者的有效斗争更为关切。他们获得戴高乐的同意，并在他的指导下，忙于筹划他们的抵抗计划，这计划不是以反对德国及维希为目的，而是以反对法国人民在获得解放时一定要表现出来的愿望为目的。
    我们必须承认：在抵抗运动的组织中，容忍使人民阵线垮台的同样的缺点是一个严重错误。这种缺点证明了对民族解放运动也是一样有害的。
    　　　　我们的党必须更加面向群众
    我们的结论必须是这样：为了团结一切劳动人民和共和分子，保卫他们的直接利益和自由权利，为了抵抗法西斯主义的新进攻和保卫法兰西的独立，我们必须更加依靠群众。我们必须记得：统一战线就是行动。各党派和集团间能够达成的协商和协议，只有在他们能够使反对人民共和国敌人的行动，因此而加强的条件下，才是有价值的。
    民族阵线的经验能够帮助我们发现团结和组织人民群众的行动的新形式。在巴黎区域的许多工厂中，工人已经选举了保卫共和委员会。以地区为基础联合所有的共和分子、共产党员。社会党员、自由思想者和天主教徒，组织这样的委员会以反对法西斯危险，反对小独裁者。保卫人民所批准的宪法也是可能的。工人和共和分子懂得“修改”宪法，就是意味着向有利于劳动人民和一切穷苦人民的社会立法及自由权利进攻。戴高乐想取消各项国有化与企业委员会，废除社会保险，垄断职工会，剥夺工人阶级的权利，以及为反抗侵略而牺牲了无数英雄的法国人民的自由权利。
    反对美国奴役我国和消灭我们民族企业的计划的斗争，已经发动得很好了。演员们、音乐家们以及电影制片业中的一切人们，已经成立了一个“保卫法国电影联盟”。可以预见，以广大的委员会为基础的联盟将逐渐组织起来，如保卫法国汽车业的联盟，或以发展一个认真的建筑计划目标，而组织联盟，团结起各小规模建筑公司、建筑工人、技师、住户、在轰炸中失去了房屋的人们，和在寻找房子住的年青夫妇等等。
    问题在于团结一切意识到威胁着共和国及危害着法国的经济和政治独立的危险的法国人民，必须以工人阶级的团结，共产党和社会党工人间的团结，为这个广泛的共和分子大团结的基础。但是这不是说，共和分子和爱国分子的团结要从属于和社会党领袖们及社会党团体间事先所订立的协议。最近的事态，使许多劳动人民对于社会党领袖们的分化政策看得很清楚了。在市政机关选举中。戴高乐派和社会党之间可耻的合作，使人民看清楚：对于那样公开和反动派联合的人们，所谓左派及右派的说法只有相对的意义。
    　　　　我国所需要的政府
    从戴高乐最近的一次宣言中可以看出危险是很大的，这位小独裁者在社会党领袖们的鼓励和支持之下，提出了要求，也大施其威胁，正是在这时候，拉马第和勃鲁姆进行着分裂工人阶级。他们装腔作势，象是同时既反对戴高乐派阴谋者，又反对信仰共产主义的忠实工人。实际上，拉马第政府和他一直到现在都做的一样，将煽起戴高乐主义和冒险主义的凶焰。
    只有一个政府能够击败政变和帝国主义战争贩子，那就是坚定地以劳动群众为基础的政府，工人阶级和他的共产党在内起着决定作用的政府。
    这将是一个执行符合人民群众要求的纲领的政府。这个政府将实行真正改革，和征发海外法国财产，使有钱人拿出钱来，这个政府将制止通货膨胀，并首先严格的削减军费以平衡预算，这只要军队依民主的原则加以改编，并且结束进攻越盟人民的罪恶战争，就可以做到了。
    这个政府将实行削减资本家的利润，制止物价的疯狂上涨，以实现劳动人民的合理要求。
    这个政府将尽力保卫宪法和共和国，反对戴高乐派和追随戴高乐派的一切阴谋者结合起来的小集团。（完）
