　　The Party Rectification Movement in Xueta Village
　　Xueta is a market town in the sixth district of Weixian County, Jinnan, with 430 households, 1,450 people, and 6,982 mu of land, equivalent to 8,607 mu of standard land. Our work began here in 1938, but it was devastated by the recalcitrant army of Shi Yousan. The enemy and puppets then occupied it as a stronghold for four years. After liberation in 1945, three major movements were carried out: anti-traitor liquidation, hiring tenants and poverty alleviation, and filling in gaps and making up deficiencies, resulting in the calculation of more than seven qing of land. The hired and poor peasants now cultivate more than three mu of land each, but the quality is poor. More than half of the landlords and rich peasants are families of soldiers and workers. The fruits of several movements were unfairly distributed. A large amount of windfall wealth and houses from last year's filling-in movement have not yet been distributed. In addition, some party members and cadres embezzled, wasted, stole, over-occupied, and sold things, and their work style was undemocratic. Therefore, it cannot be said that the masses have been completely turned over politically and economically.
　　After the work team arrived in the village, it held separate branch meetings and mass meetings, stating its attitude and explaining the spirit of the land reform and party rectification policy. Initially, a preliminary understanding of the overall situation of the village was made from party members, cadres, and visits to the poor and hired laborers. It was found that the masses had concerns about the cadres, and a few cadres with major mistakes were secretly sabotaging the work. Then, two mass meetings were held, with the participation of party members and cadres. The policy of party rectification and supplementation was explained again, and the activities of individual cadres that had been understood were openly criticized in public. The list of party members was made public, and party members and cadres were called upon to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and to accept mass review. The spirit of party rectification was explained. On the other hand, the masses were called upon to rise up, express their opinions, help with party rectification, and conduct ideological struggle with erring party members by reasoning and clarifying the facts. After the meeting, a few party members with major mistakes began to lower their heads, and the morale of the masses also increased, saying, "This time, the cadres are not like before." However, the ideological concerns of the masses were still not completely broken, such as fearing that "it will be all thunder and no rain," and complaining that our investigation took too long, demanding quicker action. Based on the degree of ideological preparation of party members and the demands of the masses, it was decided to immediately begin party rectification and combine it with mobilizing the poor and hired laborers to promote each other's development.
　　Thirty-seven new and old cadres and party members from the entire village participated in the party and cadre rectification, including nine party members. 70 percent were from poor peasant, new middle peasant, and worker backgrounds; none were landlords or rich peasants. Many cadres were newly promoted after joining the army last fall, and these people had few problems. At the beginning of the party rectification, it was clearly proposed that after the branch rectification, cadres would not be dismissed and militiamen would not hand over their guns. It was also publicly announced that there would be no beatings or deductions, and that democratic reasoning would be used.
　　At the beginning of the party rectification, in addition to verbal appeals, blackboard newspapers were also issued, welcoming the masses to participate in branch meetings, speak freely, and leave the meeting freely. The next day when the branch held a meeting, many people came to participate automatically. As criticism and self-criticism unfolded, the masses became more and more interested in participating. Sometimes, before the party rectification meeting even started, some poor and hired laborers would be waiting there early. Branch party members conscientiously reviewed and carried out criticism and self-criticism. This quickly spread throughout the village, and the number of participants increased, from one or two dozen at the beginning to sixty or seventy. Some were mobilized by our work team, some raised opinions and questions face-to-face at the meeting, and some reflected after listening, returned to the poor peasant group to convey and deliberate, and raised new opinions, which they then raised at the branch meeting the next day. This helped and promoted the reflection of party members and cadres, and at the same time broke the concerns of the masses about party members and cadres, and boosted their morale. For example, Zhai Huaifang, after seeing party members reflect and admit their mistakes, said, "They returned the house I wanted, and even if the house can't be returned, I feel happy in my heart that they admitted their mistakes at the meeting this time."
　　This kind of branch meeting with mass participation gave party members a lot of enlightenment and education in examining themselves. It also made them truly understand the spirit of the party rectification of curing diseases and saving people, and the policy of distinguishing right from wrong and treating people differently. They realized that as long as they corrected their mistakes, they would have a bright future. Through these many issues, the awareness of party members and cadres was further improved. In the process, for their respective mistakes, the method of self-deliberation and democratic discussion was adopted, and reasoning struggle was carried out, developing criticism and self-criticism. In the deliberation, the cadres gradually differentiated, and a few with major mistakes began to be isolated, and the criticism struggle between cadres and cadres, and between the masses and cadres, was fiercely unfolded. At this time, the leadership advocated full reasoning, allowing the person being criticized to make a statement at any time. Even if an error has already been admitted, it can be re-submitted to be overturned if the person believes it is unjust. Some party members and cadres had true evidence of their mistakes, but they also tried to quibble or overturn the case, which only further exposed their mistakes. Secondly, after the masses rose up, they sometimes had some extreme retaliatory opinions about a small number of party members and cadres with more mistakes, making light matters heavy and exaggerating the mistakes of cadres and party members. The leadership paid attention to these opinions in a timely manner, pointing out that party rectification is to neither relax mistakes nor wrong good people, so that the movement can get on the right track. Third, when some party members and cadres reflected to a certain extent, but their thinking had not been further cleared, it was necessary to appropriately wait for their ideological consciousness, and not continue to pursue it. Temporarily put it aside for individual talks and investigate evidence, so that he could have room for ideological change. Fourth, party members or cadres who performed well were appropriately praised at any time, and individual talks or small-scale discussions were held with some activists after the meeting to improve their understanding and encourage them to play a backbone role at the meeting. These people were mostly party members or cadres with minor mistakes, and they played a large role in the party rectification.
　　When party members and cadres reflected to a certain extent, the leadership had to raise many issues in this section to the height of ideology, conduct an education, and ask everyone to discuss and distinguish the nature, size, severity of the errors, and how to treat them differently. After self-reporting and public discussion, cadres and party members were divided into three categories: the first category included Zhai Chengyin and others, totaling twenty-one people, who had minor or no errors. The second category included nine people, who had some errors but not serious. The third category included seven people, who had more serious errors. There were also very fierce arguments during the self-reporting and public discussion. For example, Zhai Fuyin reported himself as the second category, and everyone said, "You used to be a party member and village chief. You bit out many Communist Party members in front of the enemy. This is not just a mistake, it is a crime. You should be in the third category." Liu Xitong reported himself as the third category, and everyone said, "You are responsible for safekeeping, so you are responsible for the fruits, but in fact you are not in charge, so you should be in the second category."
　　The reflection of the first category of party members and cadres was repeatedly deliberated at the branch meeting and then assisted by the poor peasant congress in the poor peasant group. The reflection was better, and it was quickly passed in the branch and among the masses. Some immediately joined the poor peasant league.
　　In the first stage of party rectification, while mobilizing the masses to participate, attention was also paid to discovering and cultivating some loyal, reliable, and capable poor and hired laborers, and they were used as the backbone to carry out chain connections, with people introducing and reviewing each other from street to street. The conditions for joining the league were agreed upon, from narrow to wide, and batches of people were absorbed into the league. After participating in the party rectification, they learned about many problems and further improved their confidence. At this time, it was the time when the old and new crops were not yet connected, and the masses urgently demanded a solution to the difficulty of eating and burning. At the same time, the poor peasant groups continued to expand, and some new middle peasants were also absorbed, with twelve male groups of one hundred and ten people and nine female groups of fifty people. Then, an education on uniting the middle peasants was carried out. The poor peasant congress elected ten representatives, and the middle and poor peasant congress elected five middle peasant representatives to jointly form a temporary agricultural representative conference to lead the masses in drawing grain from landlords and old rich peasants with large amounts of grain storage, taking out the existing fruit money from the old peasant associations, and calculating the rent from the two public-owned stores. These grains and money were quickly distributed to solve the urgent difficulties of the masses in eating and burning.
　　The difficulties of eating and burning have been solved, the masses have a relatively sound organization, and they have been tempered by a struggle. The masses have been mobilized, and then the second and third categories of party members and cadres will be discussed, and the party rectification will enter the second stage. The leadership carried out education on reasoning struggle, and the masses said, "Reasoning excludes gentlemen, and the law governs villains. Reasoning is a good method." Everyone was dissatisfied with the bad habit of beating people at the meeting in the past. At this time, a branch meeting was held (non-party cadres also participated). This branch meeting was fully prepared, and preliminary conclusions had been reached on party members and cadres. Mass representatives were invited to participate, and more than 20 temporary groups of middle and poor peasants were organized to sit around the branch in an organized and orderly manner. The meeting was presided over by the branch and the work team, and the cadres and the masses were mobilized again, explaining the purpose of inviting the masses to participate in the party rectification. Then, the party members spoke in turn. When it was mentioned that some mistakes should be the responsibility of the higher authorities, the work team immediately interrupted to explain, and fully assumed the responsibility that should be borne by the higher authorities. When it came to errors such as surrender and corruption, they immediately interjected to explain that our party's policy on dealing with errors such as corruption and surrender is to adhere to the principles of the party, distinguish between the severity of the errors, and deal with them accordingly. After a party member made a statement, the cadres, party members, and the masses immediately turned the meeting into a group meeting to deliberate and discuss, make suggestions to the speaker, and the speaker also reflected or defended according to the opinions of the masses, explaining any discrepancies with the facts, and asking others to testify. When it was considered that there were no more opinions, the general meeting became various group meetings again to discuss the handling of various errors. After deliberation, each group reported on the spot, and finally, based on the reports from inside and outside the party, the nature of the various errors was distinguished. According to the party constitution, the party members, branch members, and masses were re-educated, and conclusions were made on the spot through punishment. Those who were good were praised, and those who could not be concluded continued to deliberate.
　　In this way, the party's internal solution and the masses' solution were combined, so that party members and cadres quickly put down their burdens and immediately felt happy. They quickly showed a positive role in the branch and among the masses. In the process of reflection, the leadership seized the opportunity to educate the masses on the spot, let the masses discuss the handling, punishment and other issues on the spot, and it was easy to understand and grasp the nature of the errors and the principles of punishment. In form, it was a branch meeting and also a middle and poor peasant meeting. The meeting was combined with group meetings at any time, which was lively, flexible, simple and labor-saving. Secondly, at such a meeting, party members were educated and the masses were educated, so that party education and non-party education were combined, and education and practical problem-solving were combined. Some party members returned the embezzled or over-occupied fruits to the masses on the spot, which greatly improved the party's prestige. Thirdly, the method of combining the general meeting with group deliberation allowed everyone to have ample opportunity to speak, and individual radical opinions could be corrected in time during deliberation. Party members could also defend inappropriate opinions at any time. The meeting was filled with the atmosphere of curing diseases and saving people and democratic reasoning.
　　When the branch had been completely reorganized, the number of male and female poor peasant league members had grown to more than 230. At this time, the poor peasant league was formally established, and 19 members were elected to form a committee. Four party members who participated in the poor peasant league, three were elected as chairman and members, and the two people with the most votes were party members. Four other cadres were also elected as members. The reorganization of the party's ranks and the reorganization of the mass ranks, in the steps of appropriate cooperation, so that better party members and cadres can immediately play an active role in the mass ranks. This not only smoothly, but also quickly reorganized the party's ranks, and also reorganized the mass ranks, so that the party's prestige among the masses and the masses' understanding of the party were greatly improved.
　　The democratic party rectification in Xueta officially lasted for about a month, and the next step is to prepare to classify classes and establish a new peasant association.

　　Editor's note: The party rectification movement in Xueta Village was carried out by a work team of the Central Bureau. Its experience is generally successful. However, making conclusions, deciding on punishments and praises on the spot based on the opinions of inside and outside the party may cause problems if there is not sufficient preparation.

　　雪塔村的整党运动
    雪塔是冀南威县六区的一个集镇，有四三○户，一四五○口人，土地六九八二亩，折合标准地八六○七亩。一九三八年开始有我们的工作，后受石友三顽军摧残，敌伪又在这里按据点四年。四五年解放后进行过反奸清算、雇佃贫及填平补齐三大运动，共算出土地七顷多。雇贫农现耕地均在三亩以上，但质量差。地主富农半数以上是军工属。几次运动中果实分配不公，去年填补运动的大批浮财及房屋尚未分配，加以部分党员干部从中贪污浪费、偷窃、多占、变卖以及作风不民主等，因之群众在政治上经济上都不能说已经彻底翻透身。
    工作组到村后分别召开支部会议及群众大会，表明态度，说明土改整党政策的精神。开始从党员干部及访问贫雇中对全村面貌作了初步了解，发现群众对干部有顾虑，个别错误较大的干部暗中破坏。接着召开二次群众大会，党员干部也参加，再次讲明整党抽补方针，并将了解的个别干部活动情况，当众作了公开的批评，公开党员名单，号召党员干部进行批评与自我批评，好好接受群众审查，说明整党精神。另一方面号召群众起来发表意见帮助整党，向犯错误的党员进行说理明事的思想斗争。会后，少数错误较大的党员开始低头，群众情绪也提高，说：“这一回干部可不象以前了。”但群众思想顾虑仍未完全打破，如怕“干打雷不下雨”，又嫌我们调查时间长，要求快些行动。根据党员思想准备的程度及群众要求决定立即开始整党，并与发动贫雇结合进行，使之互相推动发展。
    全村参加整党整干的新老干部和党员三十七人，内有党员九人，成份有百分之七十是贫农、新中农、工人，没一个地主富农。不少干部都是去秋参军后新提拔的，这些人问题不大。整党开始明确提出经过支部整党：干部不赎职，民兵不缴枪，并公开宣传不打不扣，民主讲理。
    整党开始，除口头号召外，还出了黑板报，欢迎群众参加支部会议，自由发言，并可以自由退会。支部第二天开会时，不少群众自动来参加，随着批评与自我批评的开展，群众参加越来越有兴趣，有时整党会还没开，有些贫雇很早就在那里等着。支部党员认真检讨进行批评和自我批评。这样就很快传开了全村，参加的群众也越来越多了，由开始的一二十人到六七十人。有些是我们工作组动员去的，有的在会上当面提出意见与质问，有的听了反省，回到贫农小组传达酝酿提出新的意见，第二天又到支部会上提出。这样帮助和促进了党员干部的反省，同时也打破了群众对党员干部的顾虑，鼓舞了他们的情绪，如翟怀芳见到党员反省认错后，说：“俺要的房子他们倒回去，这次能在会上认了错，就是房子退不了心里也痛快。”
    这种群众参加的支部大会，给党员检讨自己以不少的启发教育，同时也使他们真正了解整党的治病救人的精神和分辨是非分别对待的方针。认识到只要改正错误就有光明前途的。通过这许多问题，进一步提高党员干部的觉悟程度。进行中对他们各人的错误，采取了由他们自己酝酿，民主讨论。说理斗争的办法，开展批评与自我批评。在酝酿中干部间逐渐分化，少数错误较大的开始孤立，干部与干部间，群众与干部间的批评斗争就激烈展开。这时领导上提倡充分说理，允许被批评的本人随时进行申辩，即使是已承认了的错误，如本人认为有冤枉时，还可重新提出推翻。有些党员干部错误有真凭实证，也企图狡辩或翻案，结果反更加暴露了自己错误。其次，当群众起来后，对少数错误较多的党员干部，有时会有些偏激报复的意见，以轻为重，夸大干部和党员的错误，领导上对这些意见及时加以注意说明，指出整党是既不放松错误也不冤枉好人，使运动走入正轨。第三、有些党员干部反省到一定程度，他本人思想还没进一步打通时，要适当等待他的思想自觉，不要一直追下去，暂搁一下进行个别谈话，调查证据，这样能使他思想有转变的余地。第四、对表现好的党员或干部，随时适当表扬，会后对有些积极分子进行个别谈话或小型座谈，提高他们的认识，鼓励他们在会上起骨干带头作用。这些人大部是错误较小的党员或干部，他们在整党中起了很大作用。
    党员干部反省到一定程度，领导上要把这一段的许多问题，提到思想的高度，作一次教育，并要大家讨论，分别错误性质、大小、轻重，及如何进行不同对待，经过自报公议，干部党员分成了三类：计第一类有翟成印等二十一人，错误不大或没什么错误。第二类九人，有些错误但不严重。第三类七人，错误较严重。在自报公议分类时也有很激烈的争论，如翟福印自报是第二类，大家说：“从前你是党员，当过村长，你在敌人面前咬了好些共产党员，这不仅是错误简置是犯罪。应放第三类。”刘西同自报第三类，大家说：“你负责保管，对果实你是有责任的，不过实际你不当家，你在第二类吧。”
    第一类党员干部的反省，在支部会上反复酝酿再经过贫农团小组中贫农大会给以帮助，反省较好，在支部内在群众中都很快被通过了，有些并立即参加了贫农团。
    在这第一阶段整党中，一方面发动群众参加，同时也注意发现培养了一些忠实可靠有能力的贫雇农，由他们作骨干进行串连，人与人街与街，互相介绍审查，议定发展入团条件，由窄到宽，一批一批的吸收进团。他们经过参加整党了解到许多问题，更提高了信心。这时正是青黄不接之时，群众迫切要求解决吃烧困难，同时贫农组也不断扩大，有些新中农也吸收进来，已有男组十二个一百一十人，女组九个五十人。接着进行了团结中农的教育，由贫农大会选出十个代表，中贫农大会上选了五个中农代表，共同组成临时的农代会，领导群众向有大量存粮的地主旧富农进行抽粮，向旧农会拿出现存的果实款，又向两家公营商店算了房租，这些粮款很快分配下去，解决了群众吃烧的迫切困难。
    解决了吃烧困难，群众已有了较健全的组织，且又经过了一次斗争锻炼，群众已发动了起来，接着讨论二三类党员干部，整党即进入第二阶段。领导上进行了说理斗争的教育，群众说“说理排君子，王法治小人，说理是好办法。”大家对过去一开会就打人的坏作风都不满。这时就召开支部大会（非党干部也参加），这次支部大会是经过充分准备，对党员和干部已有初步结论。并邀请群众代表都来参加，并组织了廿多个中贫农临时小组，有组织地有秩序地围坐在支部的周围。会议由支部、工作组主持，对干部群众又作了一次动员，说明邀请群众参加整党的目的；接着即由党员挨次发言，谈到有些错误应由上级负责时，工作组即时公开插话说明，把应由上级负责的东西，完全承担起来。当谈到自首、贪污等错误时，即插话说明我们党对贪污、自首等错误的处理政策是坚持党的原则，分别轻重，加以处理。在一个党员检讨发言后，干部党员与群众即当场将大会转为小组会酝酿讨论，对发言者提意见，本人也根据群众意见反省或申辩，与事实有出入的加以说明，也有请旁人作证的。直至认为没意见时，就又由大会变为各种小组会，讨论对各种错误的处理。酝酿后各组当场汇报，最后根据党内党外的汇报，对各种错误分别性质，根据党章，对犯错本人及支部党员与群众再进行教育，并通过处分，当场作出结论。对好的则加以表扬，不能作出结论者继续酝酿。
    这样党内解决与群众解决结合进行，使党员干部很快放下包袱，马上感到愉快。他们在支部与群众中很快表现了积极作用。在反省过程中，领导上趁热打铁，当场插话教育了群众，让群众当场讨论处理、处分等问题，对错误的性质及处分原则也易认识掌握。形式上是支部大会也是中贫农大会。大会又随时与小组会相结合，活泼灵便，简捷省力。其次，在这样的会上教育了党员也教育了群众，使党内教育与党外教育相结合，教育与实际解决问题相结合。有些党员，当场将贪污或多占的果实退给群众，大大提高了党的威信。第三、大会通过与小组酝酿结合的办法，使每个人有充分发言的机会，有个别偏激的意见，在酝酿时可即时受到纠正，党员对不恰当的意见，也可随时申辩。会上充满治病救人和民主说理的空气。
    当支部完全进行过整编后，男女贫农团员已发展到二百三十多人，这时即正式成立了贫农团，选出十九个委员成立委员会。参加贫农团的四个党员，三个被选为主席和委员，票数最多的头两名都是党员。其他干部也有四个被选为委员。整编党的队伍与整编群众队伍，在步骤上恰当的配合，使较好的党员和干部即刻能到群众队伍中起积极作用，这样不但顺利，而且迅速的整编了党的队伍，同时也整编了群众队伍，使党在群众中的威信以及群众对党的认识都大大提高。
    雪塔民主整党正式进行约一月，下一步准备划阶级成立新农会。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：雪塔村的整党运动，是中央局的一个工作团作的。其经验一般是成功的。但根据党内外意见当场作出结论，决定处分和表扬，如无充分准备则会出毛病。
