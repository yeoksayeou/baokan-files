Forced Organization of Waterwheel Production Results in Losses
Mistakes in the Practices of Guanshang and Xixiu Villages in Xiyang County

[This Newspaper] News: The organization of waterwheels for irrigation in Xixiu Village, Xingtang County, and Guanshang Village, Xinle County, infringed on the ownership and usage rights of waterwheel owners, harmed the interests of middle peasants, and had an adverse impact on the production enthusiasm of other farmers. This deviation is a very noteworthy issue in areas with irrigated land. Xixiu Village originally had fifty-four waterwheels and seventy-three wells, with all 2,245 mu of land in the village irrigated by waterwheels. Since "organizing" in 1946, only eighteen good waterwheels remain; the rest are incomplete, and two of the damaged ones don't even equal one functioning one. In the past, each waterwheel could irrigate four to six mu per day; now it only irrigates one and a half to three mu. The vast majority of waterwheel owners (out of the village’s 197 households, 132 own waterwheels, of which 104 are middle peasants, the others being poor peasants, landlords and rich peasants) are very dissatisfied with this "organized" approach. Originally, the village's "organization" of waterwheels was based on the condition of the waterwheel and the depth of the well. A few cadres forced the past privately owned waterwheels to be fixed at a well, defining the scope of irrigation, and not allowing them to be moved at will. For example, the waterwheel of the new middle peasant Zhao Luorui was fixed in the south of the village the year before last. With only people using it and no one repairing it, it broke down last year. Luorui spent his own money to repair it, but village cadres Lu Yuanwen and others ordered him to fix the waterwheel in the north of the village. Luorui was unwilling to do so, so Lu Yuanwen and others threatened him with the label of "special agent sabotaging production." He had no choice but to swallow his anger and obey. Many waterwheel owners had their good waterwheels fixed to irrigate other people's land, while their own wells were fixed with other people's bad waterwheels. The waterwheel of middle peasant Lu Lai was fixed in the south of the village, unable to irrigate any of his own land; Li Baisui's waterwheel was fixed in the east of the village as soon as it was repaired, and his land in the northeast of the village was damaged by drought. When fixing waterwheels, the scope of irrigation and the number of mu to be irrigated by each waterwheel were not discussed by the masses based on the actual situation, and the decisions were very unreasonable. In the northeast and east of the village, each fixed waterwheel had to irrigate sixty or seventy mu of land. When there was a drought, they could not keep up, and could only plant one season, which was equivalent to turning irrigated land into dry land. Some fixed waterwheels in the west of the village only irrigated thirty or so mu. The uneven workload affected production. In the past, when waterwheels were not "organized," many households without waterwheels tried to borrow from others. If they couldn't irrigate during the day, they could find time to irrigate at night, and all the land in the village could be irrigated. Since the waterwheels were "organized," households without waterwheels thought, "The waterwheels are now public property, and we have the right to use them." Some were even tougher than the waterwheel owners, vying to irrigate during the day. The waterwheel owners said, "Fine! The waterwheels have become official property, we don't care anymore!" Households without waterwheels felt that the waterwheels were not their own, so they didn't take care to maintain them and were unwilling to spend money on repairs. Therefore, many waterwheels in the village have been damaged in the past two years. Sometimes, the original owner's waterwheel was not broken, but they had to contribute money to repair other people's broken waterwheels. As a result, not only were the broken waterwheels not managed, but those who planned to buy waterwheels no longer bought them. Many people reflected, "If we weren't organized, we would sell our pants to buy a coat and repair the waterwheel, and we could even add a few new ones." Households like middle peasant Lu Luoshan had bought all the wood and other materials to repair the waterwheel, but when they heard that they would still be "organized" as before, they returned the purchased items. The reporter interviewed several main cadres of the village and asked, "With your method of organizing, who would be willing to buy a waterwheel?" One village cadre replied, "We can use this method: whoever buys a new waterwheel will be rewarded by not being ‘organized’ for two years."

This year, a similar deviation occurred in Guanshang Village, Xinyao. The village has a total of twenty-one waterwheels, of which eight and a half were confiscated during the anti-black earth campaign and not distributed (originally belonging to landlords, rich peasants, and wealthy downgraded middle peasants), and thirteen and a half belonged to middle peasants (including twenty-three middle peasant households, with varying shares). Regarding these waterwheels, the cadres stipulated, "The whole village will repair and use them uniformly." "In order to prevent the 'selfishness' of the original waterwheel owners," it was stipulated: "No one's waterwheel can be placed in their own irrigation area; they must be deliberately separated." This year, the repair of waterwheels used approximately 30 million yuan worth of undistributed floating wealth, and another three shi and six dou of wages in rice were allocated to middle peasants and above, regardless of whether they owned waterwheels, according to a unified progressive tax scale. The waterwheel owners' ownership and usage rights were restricted and deprived. Nominally, whoever owned the waterwheel still owned it, but in reality, it had become the village's public property. Middle peasant Qiu Luo, who cultivated more than ten mu of land and originally owned a waterwheel independently, told the reporter at this time, "Now what's yours and what's mine! As long as we can irrigate the land! Sooner or later everything belongs to the collective, right?!" His words represented the thinking of the general middle peasants. Therefore, "Everyone is very poor at looking after and caring for the waterwheels," "Although there are rules, damage still occurs frequently."

In late June of this year, Xingtang County used Xixiu Village as a model to rectify the waterwheel organization, proposing to "clearly guarantee the ownership of the waterwheel owners," and preparing to solicit the opinions of the waterwheel owners after the autumn harvest to appropriately adjust the position of the waterwheels and the scope of irrigation. The government has provided loans to assist in repairing waterwheels. From the end of June to the beginning of July, thirty waterwheels have been repaired, of which seven were completely unusable in the past, but are now functional. These measures prove that the local leadership is also attempting to solve the waterwheel problem, which is good. However, the past methods of harming the interests of waterwheel owners (the vast majority of whom are middle peasants) have not been fundamentally changed, such as "organizing a 'Waterwheel Management Committee,' with a group leader for every ten waterwheels," with small groups evaluating irrigation and the group leader in control, implementing "rotational irrigation." During repairs, the owners of eighteen waterwheels independently repaired their own, and still had to allocate repair costs to others. This is still a method of infringing on the waterwheel owners' ownership and usage rights. It must be recognized that organization is good, but the principle of voluntary equivalence must be truly implemented. Departing from this principle, no matter what the motivation, the result will only lead to mistakes.

### 强制组织水车生产受到损失　西秀贯上两村做法错误

　　强制组织水车生产受到损失
  　西秀贯上两村做法错误
    【本报讯】行唐县西秀村、新乐县贯上村组织水车浇地，侵犯水车主的所有权与使用权，侵害中农的利益，对其他农民的生产积极性也产生了不利的影响。这在水浇地地区是一件十分值得注意的偏向。西秀村原有五十四架水车，七十三眼井，全村二二四五亩土地，全是用水车浇。自一九四六年“组织起来”，至今只剩下十八架好水车，其余都残缺不全，两架也顶不上一架用。过去每架水车一天可浇四亩至六亩，现在只浇一亩半至三亩。绝大部分水车主（该村共一九七户，有水车户共一三二户，其中中农占一○四户，其他是贫农与地富的）对这种“组织起来”的办法非常不满意。原来该村“组织”水车是根据水车好坏，水井深浅，由少数干部强迫把过去私人的水车，固定在一个井上，划定浇地范围，不能随便移动。例如新中农赵落瑞一架水车，前年被固定在村南，光有人使，没有人修，去年坏了，洛瑞自己花钱刚修好，村干部卢元文等又命令他把水车固定在村北，洛瑞不愿这么办，卢元文等以“特务破坏生产”的帽子威胁他，他只好忍气吞声的服从了。有许多水车主，自家的好水车被固定出去浇别人的地，自己井上却固定着别人的坏水车。中农卢来的一架水车被固定在村南，浇不上自家一分地；李白岁一架水车刚修好，就被固定在村东，他村东北的地便旱坏了。固定水车时，每个水车的浇地范围及浇地亩数又未根据实际情形由群众讨论，定的很不合理。该村东北和村东，每个固定水车要浇六七十亩地，旱时忙不过来，只能种一季，等于把水地变成旱地。村西固定水车有的才浇三十余亩。忙闲不匀，影响了生产。过去水车未“组织起来”时，许多没有水车户设法借别人的用，白天不能浇，晚上可抽空浇，全村的地都能浇了。自从水车“组织起来”，没有水车的户以为“水车归公了，使水车有权”；有的甚至比水车主还来得硬气，抢着要白天浇，水车主们说：“得了！水车成了官的了，咱不管了！”没水车户觉着水车不是自己的，使用上也不加意爱护，更不愿出钱修理。因此，该村两年来损坏水车甚多，有时原主的水车并没有坏，但得摊款修理别人的坏水车。这么一来，不但坏的无人管理，打算购买水车的也不再购买了。不少群众反映：“要是不组织起来，卖裤子当袄也要修理水车，并且还能增加几架新的。”中农卢洛善等户把修理水车的木料等都买妥了，听说还要照旧“组织”起来，又把买好的东西退回去了。记者曾访问过该村几个主要干部，问：“照你们这种组织起来的办法，谁还肯买水车？”一个村干回答说：“可以用这个办法：谁再买上新水车，两年内不‘组织’来奖励他。”
    新药贯上村今年也发生了类似的偏向。该村共有二十一辆水车，其中八架半是在反黑地时斗出来未分配的（原是地主富农及富降中农的水车），十三架半是中农的（包括二十三户中农，股份多少不等）。对于这些水车，干部规定“全村统一修理，统一使用。”“为了防止原水车主的‘自私性’”，规定：“谁的水车不能按在谁的浇地区，故意插划开。”今年修理水车动用了未分配的约值三千万元的浮财，另由中农以上成份，不论有无水车一律按统一累进税分数摊派了三石六斗工资米。水车主的水车所有权和使用权都被限制和剥夺了，名义上谁的水车还是谁的，实际上已变为村公有了。中农邱洛乐种着十余亩地，原来独自有一架水车，这时他对记者说：“现在什么你的我的呀！咱能浇上地就行了！东西谁的是谁的，早晚还不是归伙？！”他的话代表着一般中农的思想，于是“大家对水车爱护看管上，就很差了”，“虽有纪律，损坏的现象还是时常发生。”
    行唐县今年六月下旬，以西秀村作典型，整顿水车组织，提出“明确保证水车主的所有权”，准备秋后征求水车主的意见，适当调整水车位置与浇地范围。政府曾贷款协助修理水车，自六月底至七月初，已修了三十架，其中七架过去根本不能用，现在能用了。这些措施证明当地领导上也在企图解决水车问题，这是好的。但是过去损害水车主（绝大多数为中农）利益的办法并没有根本的改变，如“组织了‘水车管理委员会’，十架水车一个大组长”，浇地时小组评议，组长掌握，实行“轮浇”。修理时，有十八架水车的车主独立修理了自己的，还给别人的摊了修理费。这还是侵犯水车主所有权与使用权的办法。必须认识：组织起来是好的，但必须真正贯彻自愿等价的原则，离开这个原则，不管从什么动机出发，结果都只会造成错误。
