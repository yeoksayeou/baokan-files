　　Communications Exchange
　　No. 7

　　To Comrades Journalists and Correspondents in Various Regions:
    In the past three or four months, due to the resolute and conscientious implementation of policy correction and the correction of deviations in various regions, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has greatly increased, and social order has gradually stabilized, presenting a new atmosphere of unity and production in rural areas. However, our newspaper has not adequately reflected this change. Please, while reporting on the masses' actively seizing the time to plant late autumn crops and working together to hoe the fields, spend considerable energy and time selecting several villages for systematic and typical reporting. If you can find more material, it would be even better to do comprehensive reporting on the entire district or county. In addition to boldly exposing and criticizing the errors and deviations committed in past work, as well as the resulting bad consequences and lessons, the most important thing is to report on the specific process and experience of correction. Please also specify what problems still exist, or what new problems have been discovered.

　　通讯往来
  　第七号各地记者、通讯员同志：
    近三、四个月来，由于各地坚决认真地进行了端正政策，纠正偏向，群众生产情绪大为提高，社会秩序亦渐趋安定，农村中呈现出团结生产的新兴气象。但我们的报纸，对这种情况的转变，反映得还很不够。请你们能与报导雨后群众积极抢种晚秋，变工抢锄同时，花费相当的精力与时间，选择几个村庄，作系统的典型报导。如果能找到更多的材料，以区或县做全面综合的报导更好。报导的内容除大胆的揭露与批判已往工作中所犯的错误偏向以及引起的恶果和教训外，更重要的是改正的具体过程与经验，目前尚存有哪些问题、或新发现的问题亦望写明。
