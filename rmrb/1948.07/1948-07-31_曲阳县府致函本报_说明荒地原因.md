　　Quyang County Government Sends Letter to This Newspaper Explaining the Reasons for Wasteland
　　To the Editor:

　　Upon receiving your letter inquiring about the reasons for wasteland in Quyang this year, we have conducted investigations, research, analysis, and gathered feedback from the masses. The reasons are as follows:

　　1. Land re-verified was not fully distributed to households. The remaining, poorer land was left uncultivated. For example, more than 90 mu in Shangzhuang, District 1; more than 150 mu in Shanghe, District 2; 98 mu in Nanxiaomu; and 4 mu of gardens in Tianjiakan were all re-verified land that remained undistributed.

　　2. Farmers with little or no land who were allocated land preferred to cultivate the good land and were unwilling to cultivate the poor land (for example, in Nanguan, one household was allocated 7 mu of land but only cultivated 2 mu of paddy fields, leaving the remaining 5 mu of dry land uncultivated). In Zhanli Village, District 2, more than 80 mu were left uncultivated because the land was considered "gagu" (unfavorable) (for three or four years).

　　3. Due to continuous years of natural disasters, there is a shortage of grain and grass, and livestock are not fed adequately. Furthermore, the unfair distribution of labor service burdens in the villages has led to a reduction in livestock, making cultivation difficult.

　　4. Last year, rainfall was too late, and most of the planted buckwheat was affected by early frost, resulting in no grain harvest. In addition, there was a shortage of labor (human and animal power), making it impossible to cultivate all the land.

　　5. In the past, some villages had excessively high tax quotas on land, resulting in heavy burdens. Moreover, the distribution of village burdens was unfair (in the past, some grain levies were based on harvest conditions; more labor and fertilizer resulted in stronger growth and higher taxes, which actually discouraged productive farmers). The masses felt that after paying taxes on the harvested grain, nothing was left. At the same time, the late rainfall led the masses to believe that even if they planted, they would not harvest much, so they were reluctant to plant (such as in Nanxiaomu).

　　6. Land belonging to households with no descendants is not cultivated—for example, in Yangjiasha Hou, District 5, Yang Qiuhai died alone. The head of the family does not care, the cadres do not care, and all 7 mu of land have been left uncultivated.

　　7. Due to continuous years of natural disasters, people are unable to maintain their livelihoods, and they flee to other places or engage in trade, only returning after rainfall. As a result, the land dries up and cannot be planted, such as in Zhuangzi and Niuluodou, where 10 mu have been left uncultivated.

　　8. Some villages divided land equally this year, taking back large amounts of land from landlords and former rich peasants, "and even mobilized some of the middle peasants." During the land distribution, there was blind allocation without considering the farmers' own needs and labor capacity. Even if they had enough land to cultivate, they were forced to cultivate more, which was actually impossible, resulting in both situations being delayed and the land being left uncultivated.

### 曲阳县府致函本报　说明荒地原因

1948-07-31

专栏：读者来信

　　曲阳县府致函本报
  　说明荒地原因编者同志：
    接读来函询问曲阳今年荒地原因，兹经调查研究分析及群众反映，原因有下面几种：
    一、复查出之土地没有全部分配到户。余下的较坏些没人种荒了，一区尚庄九十余亩，二区上河一百五十余亩，南孝墓九十八亩，田家坎园子四亩等，都是复查出的土地没分配完余下的。
    二、分给无地少地的农民的土地，他们只愿种好地，不愿种坏地（如南关分给一户七亩地，只种了二亩水地，其余五亩旱地荒了）。二区占里村，嫌地嘎咕（不好），荒了八十余亩（有三四年）。
    三、由于连年灾荒，谷草缺乏，牲口没有喂的，再加上村里劳役负担不公平，以致影响牲口减少，耕种困难。
    四、去年落雨太迟，大部种的荞麦，降霜更早，没打粮食，再加上劳力缺乏（人力畜力）种不及。
    五、过去有些村地里统累税产量订的高，负担重，再加上村负担不公平（过去有些征粮根据收成情况，费工多、上粪多、长的强，多纳税，实际上打击了生产积极的农民）。群众感到种上所得之粮食纳了税不剩东西；同时雨下的太晚了，群众看到种上亦打不了什么东西，故懒种了（如南孝墓）。
    六、绝户地无人耕种——如五区杨家砂侯，杨秋海一人死了。当家子不管，干部不管，将七亩地全荒了。
    七、连年灾荒，无法维持生活，出外逃荒，或作买卖，下雨后才回来，结果地干了，种不上，如庄子，牛洛斗这样荒十亩。
    八、有些村今年平分土地，由地主旧富农手里拿回大量土地，“还动员了中农一部”。在分配土地时，盲目的分配，没有根据农民自己的要求和劳动力的强弱，本来够种了，硬要叫多种，实际种不过来，结果两耽误未种上荒了。
