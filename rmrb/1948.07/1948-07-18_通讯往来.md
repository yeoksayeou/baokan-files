    Comrades, Correspondents in Various Areas of the North Yue District: The manuscript fees for June will be issued together with the manuscript fees for July after the new standards and systems are determined.
    Comrade Shao Xian of Yu County: What specific methods (such as what content and methods were used for education, their level of acceptance, what difficulties were encountered, and how were they resolved?) did the work team adopt to reverse the chaotic thinking of the cadres in Shangshe Village? What experiences have you gained in the process of rectification? Please provide a more detailed introduction.
    Comrade Liang Xinghua of Yangqu: There are a total of twenty-four mutual aid teams in Nanwencun, but twenty-three of them are not functioning. Please investigate in depth to find out why they are not functioning. You said that Liu Tiedan's team is doing well, but you did not explain what conditions they rely on to do well (such as how they combine their efforts and implement equal pay for equal work in each production season, their leadership methods, and their self-determined systems). Please supplement the specific process.

Please comprehensively organize a report on the details of disaster relief and assistance to the masses in replanting the fields.

How many people are participating? What is the daily output and profit? How much has this industry helped the masses to overcome the famine?

　　通讯往来　第五号
    北岳区各地通讯员同志：六月份的稿费，待新标准与新制度确定后，将与七月份稿费一齐发下。
    盂县少先同志：上社村干部的混乱思想，工作组究竟是采用了那些具体方法（如以什么内容与方式进行教育，他们的接受程度，曾遇到些什么困难问题，怎样解决的？）扭转过来的？你们在整顿过程中，摸索到一些什么经验？请再做详细的介绍。
    阳曲梁兴华同志：南温川共二十四个变工组，但就有二十三个不起作用的，请你深入调查一下，究竟因为什么原因不起作用？你说刘铁旦他们那个组坚持的好，但你没说明他们是靠着那些条件才坚持好（如他们在各个生产季节中，怎样各尽所能相互结合，实行计工等价，他们的领导方法与自定的制度等），请将具体过程再补充一下。
    行唐县委负责同志：据四支社来稿称：你县于上月三十日有八十余村遭受雹灾，请即将救灾及扶助群众整田补种的详情全面组织报导。
    二专署田夫同志：请你再把盂县三区日前已开张的锄业做详细介绍，说明他们是怎样组织恢复的（私人集资与政府发贷多少），现有几座？多少人参加？日产量与获利若干？此业对帮助群众渡荒起了多大作用？现当地政府对发展该业的设施计划等写来。
