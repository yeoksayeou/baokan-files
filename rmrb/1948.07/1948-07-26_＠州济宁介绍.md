Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd. ＠zhou and Jining are two major towns in southwestern Shandong, one known for its strategic location, and the other for its commerce.

　　＠zhou (i.e., Ziyang), is located in the center of the Jinpu Railway's Ji (nan) Xu (zhou) section, with a population of 80,000. Jining is located 50 li southwest of ＠zhou on the south bank of the Grand Canal, with the ＠ji branch line directly connecting ＠zhou and linking to the Grand Canal's shipping. The products of southwestern Shandong are distributed to the north and south through the water and land transportation of these two cities.

　　Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, ＠zhou has been occupied by the Wu Huawen troops, a puppet army incorporated by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. It is currently the largest military stronghold of the Chiang bandits in southwestern Shandong, and has modern, permanent fortifications. Chiang's "Tenth Pacification Zone" is located here, and together with Jinan, Qingdao, and Linyi, it is one of the four command centers of Shandong.

　　Jining is an industrial and commercial city, which was opened as a commercial port in the tenth year of the Republic of China. Before the war, the population was over 150,000, with more than 4,000 large and small industrial and commercial enterprises, known for its iron making, egg processing, bamboo ware, flour, and tobacco industries. After long-term destruction and harassment by the Japanese invaders and Chiang bandits, the city's industry and commerce have been badly damaged, and the population has sharply decreased to 110,000.

　　＠州济宁介绍
    【新华社华东二十三日电】＠州、济宁为山东西南部两大重镇，一以形势著称，一以商业著称。
    ＠州（即滋阳），居津浦路济（南）徐（州）段的中心，人口八万。济宁位于＠州西南五十里之运河南岸，有＠济支线直通＠州，并连接运河航运，鲁西南物产均经该二城的水陆运输行销南北各地。
    自日寇投降，＠州即为蒋匪收编的伪军吴化文部所盘踞，为蒋匪当前鲁西南最大军事据点，并建有现代化、永久性工事，蒋之“第十绥靖区”即设于此，与济南、青岛、临沂为山东四指挥重心。
    济宁为一工商业城，民国十年即自辟为商埠。战前人口在十五万以上，大小工商四千余家，向以制铁、打蛋、竹器、面粉、烟草诸业著称。经日寇与蒋匪长期破坏骚扰，该城工商业遍体鳞伤，人口已锐减至十一万。
