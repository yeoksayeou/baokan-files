Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th: On the 14th of last month, two thousand farmers in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, rose up in anger to resist rent and disarmed the Chiang bandit self-defense force. According to a report in the Shanghai News on June 15th: The rent collection office jointly established by landlords in Donggangjing Town, Guizheng Township of the county, sent people to the countryside to forcibly collect rent grain, savagely beating tenant Chen Jinlin, arousing public outrage among nearby farmers. A crowd of two thousand people, beating gongs, rushed into Donggangjing Town, smashed the houses of local bullies and landlords, and severely beat Chiang's town head Cheng Zhonghua and landlord representative Guan Chunlin. The town's self-defense force actually opened fire on the farmers resisting rent. The rent-resisting masses immediately disarmed the entire force. Note: Previously, in Jiangsu's Wu County (Suzhou), five to six hundred farmers each from Xiangcheng and Huangdai districts had successively resisted rent on May 17th and 18th, smashing the rent collection warehouses of the Chiang government in each district.

　　地主强收租粮凶殴佃户
  　常熟二千农民抗租
    【新华社华中十八日电】上月十四日江苏常熟县二千农民愤起抗租，并将蒋匪自卫队缴械，据六月十五日沪新闻报披露：该县归政乡洞港泾镇地主联合收租处派人下乡强收租粮，凶殴佃户陈金林，激起附近农民公愤，鸣锣群众达二千人，冲入洞港泾镇，捣毁恶霸地主房屋，痛打蒋记镇长程仲华及地主代表管春林。该镇自卫队竟向农民开枪射击，抗租群众立将该队枪械全部缴除。按：前此江苏吴县（苏州）湘城、黄埭两区农民各五、六百人曾先后于五月十七、十八两日抗租，捣毁各该区之蒋政府收租栈。
