　　Protest the Reactionaries' Crime of Murdering Togliatti!
　　Resolutely Counterattack the Reactionaries' Attacks
　　The People's Will Has Been Expressed
　　General Confederation of Labour Decides to End General Strike
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th] TASS reports: The Executive Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labour passed a resolution: The general strike will be suspended from noon on July 16th. The resolution declares: The Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour is satisfied to point out that the working people of Italy, with moving unanimity, participated in the general strike to protest the vicious conspiracy of hired assassins to assassinate Togliatti. This conspiracy is an integral part of the reactionaries' offensive against the masses of the people. The general strike, incited by this vicious conspiracy, clearly demonstrates the supreme will of the people to resolutely counterattack the reactionaries' attacks. After determining that the broad masses have demonstrated an invincible fighting will, the Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour decided to suspend the general strike from noon on the 16th. The Executive Committee believes that the resolute and powerful response of the masses to the reactionaries' crimes has brought the necessity of fundamentally changing government policies to the fore of the nation.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th] TASS reports: The General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, Vittorio, Secretary Bitossi Santi, and Executive Committee member Bari, visited Gasperi on the 15th to inform him of the demands drafted by the working people during the general strike. After meeting with Gasperi, Vittorio issued a statement to the press, saying: "We visited the President of the Council of Ministers to protest the government's communiqué that slandered the General Confederation of Labour for attempting to undermine the constitutional system. We have declared that the General Confederation of Labour believes that the general strike is an expression of the working people's anger at the murder of Togliatti. Vittorio also stated: We have also emphasized that the murder of Togliatti is the result of the government's policy of encouraging reactionary forces. The General Confederation of Labour insists on changing the situation and re-establishing a constitutional democratic regime.

　　抗议反动派谋杀托格里亚蒂罪行！
    坚决反击反动派袭击
  　人民意志已经表达
    总工会决定停止总罢工
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社报导：意大利总工会执委会通过决议：自七月十六日中午起停止总罢工。决议宣称：总工会执委会满意地指出，全意劳动人民令人感动地一致参加了总罢工，以抗议雇佣凶手暗杀托格里亚蒂的毒辣阴谋。这一阴谋，是反动派反对人民大众的攻势之一个组成部分。为这毒辣阴谋所激起的总罢工，明确地证明了人民坚决反击反动派袭击的无上意志。在确定广大群众已表现了不可战胜的斗争意志之后，总工会执委会决定自十六日中午起停止总罢工。执委会认为：群众对反动派罪行的坚决而有力的答复，已把根本改变政府政策的必要提到国家面前。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社报导：意大利总工会总书记维特里奥、书记比托西·杉蒂及执委巴里，十五日往访加斯贝利，以劳动人民在总罢工过程中拟成的要求告知加氏。在会见加斯贝利后，维特里奥向报界发表声明称：“我们曾访问部长会议主席，以便对政府诬蔑总工会企图破坏立宪政体的公报表示抗议。我们已经宣告，总工会认为总罢工是劳动人民对谋杀托格里亚蒂所表示的愤怒。维特里奥又称：我们也曾着重指出，谋杀托格里亚蒂是政府鼓励反动势力政策的结果。总工会坚持改变形势并重建立宪民主政权。
