　　Taihang Third Prefectural Committee

　　Commends Li Shunda and Xiang Tishui for Water Lifting

　　Calls for Learning from Their Implementation of Production and Party Rectification Policies

　　[Taihang News] The Taihang Third Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a circular on "July 1st," commending the correct thinking, exemplary actions, and outstanding achievements in the work of model Party members Li Shunda (Xigou, Pingshun) and Xiang Tishui (Shili Village, Huguan). It stated:

　　Li Shunda's five-year plan for prosperity and construction, established in 1946, is almost fully completed after two and a half years of labor, and some parts have even exceeded the original plan. Now, the granaries are full of grain, with no shortage of food and clothing; wearing new clothes and living in new houses; covered with new quilts and spread with new felt mats; cattle, mules, and donkeys are thriving in the stalls; sheep are in flocks, and wealth fills the pens; this is the Party's production policy. The Party calls on all Party members and masses in the region to implement this production policy of getting rich, and Comrade Shunda carefully plans, works diligently, and resolutely believes in and implements this policy. Under the leadership and influence of Comrade Shunda, the lives of the masses in the whole village have gradually become prosperous. This is why Comrade Shunda is called a model and why everyone needs to learn from him. Comrade Xiang Tishui correctly understands the Party's policy of Party rectification and adheres to the Party's policy of Party rectification. He always believes: "Party rectification is because the Party has problems, and there is a gap between the Party and the masses. If the Party is not rectified, it will fail; Party rectification is for the sake of improvement, and for the sake of improving the relationship between the Party and the masses." When he encounters opinions that are inconsistent with the facts, he also has troubles, but he does not complain or give up, but seeks correct solutions, and quickly understands: "Party rectification is the Party cultivating and educating me, and if I have bad work styles and mistakes, I should correct them. Sometimes when we do work, we make mistakes, just like weeding seedlings, if we are not careful, we will damage the seedlings. We should be careful in the future. It is not right to be afraid of damaging the seedlings and not do anything. It is the same with doing work." He also always believes: "The revolution is to make us rich, not to make us poor." He has these correct thoughts and understandings, and often explains them to cadres and the masses, which turns into the thoughts and understandings of cadres and the masses. Therefore, he can smoothly carry out Party rectification work, and in the land reform and Party rectification, the whole village adheres to active production and achieves great results. Comrade Li Shunda has the same correct understanding in this regard. Comrades Li Shunda and Xiang Tishui can understand and implement the Party's production policy and Party rectification policy in this way, and as a result, they have made great achievements for the Party, the masses, and themselves. We believe that there are also model Party members like Comrades Li and Xiang in each village. As long as they work hard, they will surely be able to prosper themselves, and at the same time lead the masses to prosper, and transform themselves well, and at the same time lead all Party members and cadres to transform well.

　　太行三地委
    表扬李顺达向提水
    号召学习他们执行生产、整党政策
    【太行讯】中共太行三地委在“七一”发出通报，表扬模范党员李顺达（平顺西沟）、向提水（壶关十里村）二同志的正确思想、模范行动与工作中的优秀成绩。内称：
    李顺达同志在一九四六年订的五年发家建设计划，经过二年半的劳动，已快全部完成，部分并超过了原来计划。如今粮食满囤，不缺吃穿；穿新衣住新房；盖新被铺新毡；牛骡毛驴，槽头兴旺；羊子成群，活财满圈；这就是党的生产政策。党号召全区党员，群众实行这个发家致富的生产政策，顺达同志即精心计划、勤劳动弹，坚决的相信与执行这个政策。在顺达同志领导与影响下，全村群众的生活都慢慢富裕起来。这就是顺达同志所以称为模范和大家需要向他学习的地方。向提水同志正确了解党的整党政策，坚持党的整党政策。他始终认为：“整党是党有了毛病，党与群众有了隔膜，不整好党要失败；整党是为整好，是为改善党与群众的关系。”他遇到有些与事实不符的意见时，也有苦恼，但他不瞒怨不躺倒，寻求正确的解决办法，很快就想通了：“整党是党培养教育我，自己作风不好有错误，应该改正。咱做工作有时犯了错误，和上地锄苗一样，一不小心就要把苗锄坏，以后小心就对啦，要是怕锄坏不去动弹也不对，做工作也是一样。”他也始终认为：“革命是叫咱富哩，不是革的叫咱穷。”他有这些正确的思想与认识，又经常向干部、群众解释，变成了干部、群众的思想与认识，因此能够顺利的进行整党工作，并在土改、整党中，全村坚持积极生产，成绩很好。李顺达同志在这方面，也是同样的认识正确。李顺达与向提水二同志，能这样了解与执行党的生产政策与整党政策，结果对党对群众对自己都作出了很大的成绩。我们相信各村也有象李、向二同志的模范党员，只要努力，一定都能自己发家，同时领导群众发家，自己改造好，同时领导全体党员干部改造好。
