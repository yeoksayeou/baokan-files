Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 17th—The Northwest Field Army, along with the local democratic government and the masses, held a grand joint memorial meeting on July 7th to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War. General Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army and Commander of the Northwest Field Army, delivered a speech at the meeting, stating: "Without the Chinese Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, Japanese imperialism would not have been driven out, and China would have been subjugated!" After briefly recounting the history of the development of our Party and our army, he said: "Twenty-seven years is not a long time, but our strength has increased a thousandfold. Our Party has grown from a small group of dozens of people at the beginning to a national mass party with more than three million members today; our army has grown from a few thousand people in 1927 to tens of thousands in 1937 to millions now; the Liberated Areas have grown from tens of thousands of people in the past to more than 160 million people today. This shows that as long as it is in line with the truth, even if it seems small at first, it will become infinitely strong in no time." Deputy Commander Peng recalled the situation in the Northwest theater over the past sixteen months, saying: "We have eliminated 116,000 enemy troops, changing the numerical ratio between the enemy and us from one to thirteen, to the point where the enemy does not have much more than us in number today. This is a major victory. Regionally speaking, in August and September of last year, all the county towns in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region had fallen into enemy hands one after another. Now, except for Qingyang, Dingbian, and other five cities still in enemy hands, not only has the entire Border Region been liberated, but dozens of new cities and vast new liberated areas have also been liberated. Hu Zongnan's capital is getting smaller and smaller. His recent clamoring about the 'Huanglong Mountain Area decisive battle,' etc., is just a bluff. If he really dares to come to the Huanglong Mountain Area, then his doomsday will come even faster." Deputy Commander Peng finally told everyone with excitement: The national victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution is not far off, and the day of attacking Xi'an and capturing Hu Zongnan alive is even closer. Faced with this favorable situation, all comrades of the Northwest Field Army must abandon personal plans and continue to work harder and fight better. He called for continuing to deepen the mass line rectification movement within the Party, examine and approve the large number of Party members and cadres recommended by the masses, so that new forces can grow continuously, and strive for the final victory of the people's revolutionary war to come sooner. Deputy Commander Peng's speech gave great encouragement to the soldiers and civilians present, and the entire venue shouted slogans such as "Down with Hu Zongnan, liberate the Great Northwest!" Finally, the Northwest Art Troupe performed the famous Northwest revolutionary historical drama "Zhou Zishan," and the meeting did not end until late at night.

　　西北野战军驻地纪念“七七”
    彭副总司令发表讲演
    号召全军作好工作打好仗争取胜利更早到来
    【新华社西北十七日电】西北野战军与驻地民主政府及群众于七月七日联合举行盛大的“七七”抗战十一周年纪念大会。人民解放军副总司令兼西北野战军司令员彭德怀将军于会中发表讲演称：“八年抗战，没有中国共产党和八路军、新四军，日本帝国主义就打不出去，中国就会亡国！”他在简单叙述我党及我军的发展历史后，说：“二十七年的时间并不算长，但我们的力量是千百倍地增涨了。我党由开始时的几十个人的小组发展成为现在的三百万人以上的全国的群众性的大党；我们的军队由一九二七年的几千人到一九三七年的几万人发展到现在的几百万人；解放区由过去的几十万人发展到现在的一亿六千余万人。由此可见，只要是合乎真理的，那怕最初看来很小，但时间不会多久，就将无比壮大起来。”彭副总司令回述十六个月来的西北战局说：“我们消灭了敌人十一万六千人，使敌我在数量上由一与十三之比，达到今天敌人在数量上并不比我们多了多少，这是一件重大的胜利。就地区说，去年八、九月时，陕甘宁边区的所有县城，均曾先后沦陷敌手，现在除庆阳、定边等五城尚在敌手外，不仅全边区光复了，且解放了几十个新城市和广大新解放区。胡宗南的本钱是越来越小了，他前些时候吵叫什么‘黄龙山区大会战’等等，那仅是虚张声势而已。如果他真的敢来黄龙山区，那么他的末日就更快了。”彭副总司令最后满怀兴奋的告诉大家：中国人民民主革命的全国胜利，已为期不远，打到西安活捉胡宗南的日子已更迫近。面临这种有利形势，西北野战军全体同志们必须抛弃个人打算，继续努力把工作做得更好，把仗打得更好。他号召继续深入开展群众路线的整党运动，把群众推荐出来的大批党员、干部加以审查批准，使新的力量源源增长，争取人民革命战争的最后胜利更早到来。彭副总司令的讲演给到会军民以极大鼓舞，全场高呼“打倒胡宗南，解放大西北”等口号，末由西北文工团演出西北革命历史名剧“周子山”，直到深夜始散。
