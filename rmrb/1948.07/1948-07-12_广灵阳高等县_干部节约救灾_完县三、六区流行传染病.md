[North Yue News] Cadres of the Guangling and Yanggao county and district organs of the North Yue First District economize on food and clothing to raise funds for disaster relief. Guangling's organs have implemented a call for each person to save one tael of rice per day. County government cadres also donated 175,000 yuan, and the Political Department and village cadre training class each donated 200 jin of millet for disaster relief. A "Handful of Rice Movement" has also been launched among the masses to help each other and overcome the famine together. Dongguan in Guangling alone raised 1,999,500 yuan and 16 jin of millet. Cadres in the first district of Yanggao recognized the severity of the disaster at the district's production meeting and voluntarily donated 97,500 yuan. Twenty-four cadres in the fifth district donated more than 350,000 yuan. Comrade Lu Xiheng took out all of his issued straw hat money and pocket money, totaling 40,000 yuan, for disaster relief.

[North Yue News] Some areas of Wanxian County have suffered hail, insect, and disease disasters. County and district cadres are now organizing the masses to take emergency measures. At noon on June 30, hail fell in the first, second, and fourth districts, lasting for two to three minutes. The disaster was particularly severe in Dabeixiao area of the first district and Daogu and Chaigezhuang villages in the second district. The government has sent personnel to the disaster areas to investigate and express condolences, and is actively planning replanting.

Recently, grasshoppers have been found in the Dahuangyu and Ningjiazhuang areas of the first district of the county, harming autumn seedlings. Sorghum maggots have been found in villages in the southern part of the sixth district, specializing in biting the sorghum tips. The masses are now exterminating and treating them. Aphids have appeared on cotton and cowpea plants in some villages in the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts. The masses are using water to kill insects and rescue the plants, with great effect.

Individual villages in the third and sixth districts have experienced disease disasters. Smallpox is prevalent in Sixin Village in the sixth district, and a dozen children under the age of ten have died, and adults have also contracted smallpox. A type of acute illness has occurred in Xizhuangli in the third district, which the masses call "intestinal torsion sha," and two people have already died. Coughing is prevalent among children, causing them to lose breath and have bloody stools. In addition to instructing the districts to quickly provide treatment and prevention, the county leadership organs, in conjunction with the Medical Association Training Class, are organizing doctors to go to the countryside for treatment.
