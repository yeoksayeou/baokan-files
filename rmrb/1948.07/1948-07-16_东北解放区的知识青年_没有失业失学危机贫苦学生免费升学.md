　　In the Northeast Liberated Areas, due to the correct implementation of the "Decision on Intellectuals" by the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the implementation of the policy of winning over, reforming, and cultivating intellectuals, intellectual youths in various regions have obtained ample opportunities for schooling in the past six months, eliminating the danger of being out of school and unemployed. In terms of secondary schools, according to incomplete statistics from the seven provinces in North Manchuria, there are approximately 120 schools with over 50,000 students. Free student positions or work-study programs are generally available in each middle school, providing broad opportunities for poor youths to advance their education. There are more than ten specialized schools and cadre schools throughout the region, including the Northeast Academy of Sciences, Northeast University, Jilin University, China Medical University, Military and Political University, Railway School, Postal and Telecommunications School, and Siping Street College of Arts and Agriculture, with nearly 20,000 students. Most students receive public funding, with the school providing clothing, food, lodging, and stationery expenses. The Northeast Academy of Sciences, the highest scientific institution in the Northeast, opened on July 6th. Students who have newly arrived from the KMT-controlled areas feel extremely happy in the atmosphere of free research and learning. They say, "The students here are truly like brothers, helping each other in learning and life. It is simply a harmonious big family." The academy has departments of agriculture and forestry, science and engineering, medicine, and education, enrolling students from secondary schools and above. Graduates are assigned to serve in various railways, mines, and factories. The academy also has a Natural Science Research Institute, which attracts experts with university degrees or special technical skills from home and abroad to conduct research. The education in the newly recovered areas also presents a vigorous and developing atmosphere. Jilin University, which was reorganized and opened by merging the "Changbai Normal College" and the "Yongji University Preparatory Class" formerly run by the KMT government, already has nearly a thousand students. Most of the original professors and lecturers have been reappointed by Jilin University. All poor students and those whose families are in the KMT-controlled areas uniformly enjoy preferential treatment with public funding. Most of the teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools in Jilin City have also remained at their posts, with a total of over 28,000 students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools throughout the city. At the beginning of its establishment, Anshan United Middle School had more than 1,600 students, and another 200 intellectual youths were admitted to the elementary school teacher training class. Haicheng United Middle School started classes in May, with more than 1,300 students enrolled.
