　　Jiluyu Regional Party Committee's Emergency Directive
    Combine Production and Flood Control
    [Jiluyu News] With the Yellow River's high-water season approaching, the Jiluyu Regional Party Committee has issued an emergency directive regarding flood control work to "ensure the Yellow River embankment is not breached." The directive calls for combining flood control with production and organizing forces to repair the dikes as much as possible. The directive states: "Completing this year's flood control work is one of the most important tasks for our Party, government, army, and people along the Yellow River. Due to the seesaw battles on the south bank, the enemy has repeatedly damaged the Yellow River dikes, resulting in significant consumption of our manpower and resources, while the dangerous sections and dikes have not been properly repaired. Regarding the water situation, although we have equipment, the fluctuating water levels make it difficult to take the initiative. Moreover, the newly repaired dikes are not yet solid enough, especially in the sections controlled by the enemy, where dangerous sections and dikes have not been restored. Under these circumstances, ensuring that both banks are not breached and protecting the people's interests is a task that our Party, government, and people cannot neglect. The slightest carelessness could lead to a breach. To ensure the completion of the task, it has been decided that this year's flood control policy will be 'phased, sectional, and focused defense,' overcoming formalism and generalization. The Party committees, governments, and repair departments along the Yellow River should conduct meticulous organization based on this spirit and establish strong command organs at all levels, paying particular attention to combining flood control with production. To ensure a reasonable labor burden, it has been decided that flood control villages will not be assigned combat support tasks during the flood season, avoiding the dispersion of forces. In newly liberated areas, necessary armed forces must be dispatched to provide cover based on the situation. The flood season begins on July 7th this year. After receiving this directive, Party committees and governments at all levels must complete all preparatory work before the flood season and must not neglect this. During the flood season, responsible personnel at all levels of the government along the river must personally inspect the dikes. When the water situation is critical, county and district chiefs, and section chiefs must also go to the dikes to supervise and carry out various flood control tasks to ensure the completion of the major task of 'ensuring the Yellow River embankment is not breached.' If any section is lost due to negligence in flood control work, the local leaders along the river will be fully responsible to the people."
    [Jiluyu News] As we are urgently repairing the Yellow River dikes on the south bank, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are dispatching light and heavy bombers to strafe and bomb day and night, destroying the dike restoration project. On the 2nd of this month, three Chiang Kai-shek planes strafed back and forth over Li Jinshi Hall in the Juancheng section, wounding one of our dike restoration workers from the first district. On the 22nd, three Chiang Kai-shek planes dropped bombs all night in Yihezhuang, Eighth District, Shounan section, killing six people and wounding three. The planes also dropped bombs in Yingtang and Guo Nali, wounding seven of our dike restoration workers from the third district. At dawn on the 23rd, they bombed Cheng Nali in the Second District in shifts, killing twelve dike restoration workers from the Ninth District and wounding fourteen.

　　冀鲁豫区党委紧急指示
    生产与防汛结合起来
    【冀鲁豫讯】黄河大汛期将至，冀鲁豫区党委为了“确保临黄不使开口”，特发出关于防汛工作的紧急指示，号召防汛与生产结合，尽可能组织力量抢修堤坝。指示称：“今年完成防汛工作任务，为我沿河党政军民重要工作任务之一。由于南岸拉锯形势，敌人对临黄堤屡加破坏，致使我人力物力虽消耗甚大，而险工堤坝未能修好；在水情方面我们虽有设备，但水势忽涨忽落，亦难掌握主动，并且新修堤坝尚不够巩固，特别在敌人控制的堤段，河堤险工及堤坝均未修复。我们处于这种情况下，确保两岸不准开口，维护人民利益，实我党政民不可忽视的任务，如稍有不慎，即有决口危险。今为保证任务之完成，特决定今年防汛方针为‘分期分段重点防守’，克服形式主义和一般化。各临黄的党委政府和修防处段，应根据这一精神进行严密组织，并建立各级有力指挥机关，特别注意防汛与生产结合。为使劳力负担合理，决定防汛村在防汛期不出战勤任务，毕免分散力量。在新区，根据情况必须派出必要武装予以掩护。今年七月七号即入汛期，各级党委政府接此指示后，必须于汛期前将所有准备工作做好，不得忽视。汛期沿河政府各级负责人员，必须上堤亲自检查，水势危急时县区长、段长亦必须上堤监督，切实进行各种防汛工作，保证完成‘确保临黄不使开口’的重大任务。那段如因防汛工作疏忽失事，由该临河首长对人民负完全责任”。
    【冀鲁豫讯】在我紧急抢修黄河南岸临黄堤之际，蒋匪派遣轻重轰炸机日夜轮番扫射轰炸，破坏复堤工程。本月二日，蒋机三架在鄄城段李进士堂上空往来扫射，打伤我一区复堤民工一人。二十二日蒋机三架整夜在寿南段八区义和庄投弹，炸死群众六人，伤三人。该机并在影塘、郭那里投弹，炸伤我三区复堤民工七人。二十三日拂晓又在二区程那里轮番轰炸，炸死九区复堤民工十二人，伤十四人。
