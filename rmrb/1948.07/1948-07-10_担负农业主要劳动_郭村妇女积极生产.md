[North China News] Guo Village in Meng County is a marginal area. Since the beginning of spring, in order to prevent enemy disruption, the slogan "Start early, rush to cultivate and plant" has been put forward, and both young men and women have enthusiastically invested in agricultural production. Women activists like Qin Linzhuang, Sun Shuangxiu, Wang Efeng, and Zhao Yuting, who emerged during the land reform struggle, led 102 young women in participating in major labor tasks such as breaking up clods, hoeing field edges, spreading manure, sowing seeds, delivering manure, and carrying manure. Currently, they have taken up large hoes to weed the seedlings. Zhang Wuni, Gao Xiaomei, and Yang Guixiang have learned how to use seed drills and stone mills. They said, "Now the women's minds have changed, and they know that labor is the way to succeed. In the past, Er You's wife suffered a lot in the fields, and others laughed at her, but now everyone wants to emulate her." Many women who used to only do light work such as spreading manure and pinching seeds have now taken on heavy work such as driving carts to deliver manure, carrying manure, and hoeing seedlings. Sun Sanxiu, Qin Linzhuang, Liu Fuyu, Liang Meifeng, Guo Wangyu, and more than 20 other women drove carts, delivering a total of 2,275 carts of manure, and 570 mu of land were cleared of clods and tree stumps through mutual aid and labor exchange, and 24 mu were planted with corn. Qin Linzhuang's family of three, with her husband away and her mother-in-law old, cultivated over ten mu of land entirely on her own. She used her labor to exchange for animal labor in the labor exchange group (one and a half units of human labor for one unit of animal labor) without relying on others, and planted all the land. Now, the weeding of the large fields is nearing completion. Sun Sanxiu has been working in the fields every day since the beginning of spring, and Zhang Lianmei leaves her child with her mother-in-law at home to work in the fields. All the land has been planted. When our army annihilated the Yan bandit Zhao Junyi's unit on May 1st, most of the men and livestock in the village followed the army to the front, and the women took on the task of taking care of the stationed troops. Under the active leadership of Qin Linzhuang and others, 64 young women and more than 30 children carried grain to the Zhonglan Village Grain Station, 12 li away, carrying 8,100 jin in three days, ensuring the supply of grain to the troops. Other women helped the troops sew and wash clothes. Many cadres and masses said, "If it weren't for the women's active participation in production this year, the land would have been left barren. And if it weren't for the women's active carrying of grain this time, the troops' meals would have been affected." The village has a total of 41 hectares of land, and thanks to the women's active participation in agricultural production, the call to leave no land uncultivated has been realized.

　　担负农业主要劳动
    郭村妇女积极生产
    【北岳讯】盂县郭村是个边缘区，入春以来，为了防止敌人扰乱，提出“提早下手，抢耕抢种”的口号，男女青壮年均热烈投入农业生产中。在土改斗争中的妇女积极分子秦林状、孙双秀、王俄凤、赵玉亭等，在生产运动中带领了一百零二名青壮妇女参加打圪垃、刨地边、散粪、撒种、送粪、担粪等主要劳动，目前已扛起大锄进行锄苗。张五妮、高小梅、杨贵香已学会了提耧踩磨。她们说：“现在妇女们心眼都转过来了，知道劳动就有办法。二有年老婆过去在地里受的强，别人都笑的不行，现在都想向她看齐了”。不少妇女过去只做散粪、捏种等轻活，今年已担负了赶车送粪、担粪锄苗等重活。孙三秀、秦林状、刘福鱼、梁梅凤、郭王鱼等二十多个妇女赶车，共送粪二千二百七十五车，互助变工打圪垃、刨楂子五百七十亩，种玉茭二十四亩。秦林状全家三口人，男人不在家，婆婆又老了，全家刨十几亩地，由她自己在变工组里以人工换畜工（一个半人工换一个畜工），没有用别人，全部种上，现锄大田已将结束。孙三秀从开春到现在，每天都在地里生产，张连梅把娃子给他婆婆留在家，也下地生产，地都种好了。当我军在五月一日围歼阎匪赵俊义部时，全村的男人和牲口大都随军上了前方，妇女们担负了招呼驻军的任务。在秦林状等积极带领下，六十四名青年妇女，三十多个儿童，到十二里远的中兰村粮站背粮，三天背了八千一百斤，保证了部队粮食的供给。其他妇女则帮助部队缝洗衣服。不少干部和群众说：“今年要不是妇女积极生产，地就得荒了，这次要不是妇女积极背粮，部队吃饭也会受点影响”。该村共有土地四十一顷，由于妇女积极的参加了农业生产，已实现了不荒一亩土地的号召。
