　　July 11th and still haven't received the "July 1st" newspaper.
  　Jin cheng Post Office Should Investigate

    Comrades of the People's Daily:
    The People's Daily that our senior primary school subscribed to in June at the Jin cheng County Post Office was received very incompletely. Here is a list of the missing issues from June, counting from the inaugural issue: issues 4, 6, 7, 8, and 16 were not received.
    From the July 1st newspaper onwards, we have not received a single issue as of July 11th. Our school is located in Ba gong Town, only thirty *li* from Jin cheng, and we don't know why we haven't received the first eleven days' worth of newspapers after eleven days. On July 10th, we saw the July 6th newspaper in the city.
    Please, comrades in charge of delivering newspapers at the Jin cheng Post Office, investigate why we missed five issues of the newspaper in June? Also, why is it that Ba gong Town is only thirty *li* from the city, yet we still haven't seen the newspaper by the 11th? We hope the responsible comrades at the post office will investigate and give us a reply.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Jin cheng Second District Third Senior Primary School, Wang Yi

    Recently, we have received many letters from readers reflecting that they have not received their subscriptions, or that the dates of receipt are reversed. We hope that post offices in various regions will investigate section by section and make improvements. Our newspaper's distribution work should also strive for improvement. ——Editor

### 七月十一还未收到“七一”的报纸　晋城邮局应作检查

　　七月十一还未收到“七一”的报纸
  　晋城邮局应作检查人民日报馆同志：
    我们高小六月份在晋城县邮政局所订的人民日报，收的很不齐。现将六月份没有收到的份数按号写出：从创刊号起计有第四、六、七、八、十六号，均未收到。
    从七月一日的报纸起，到十一日还没有收到一期。我们学校住在巴公镇，离晋城仅三十里，不知为啥十一天还没有收到前十一天的报纸。七月十日在城里已见到七月六日的报纸了。
    请晋城邮政局负责发报纸的同志检查一下，为什么六月份给我们发掉五期报纸？又为什么巴公镇离城才三十里，十一日还看不上报纸？希邮局负责同志检查一下，给我们答复为盼。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　晋城二区第三高小　王毅
    最近我们收到不少读者来信反映订报收不到，或收到日期颠倒，希各地邮局逐段检查，并加改进。本报发行工作也当力求改进。——编者
