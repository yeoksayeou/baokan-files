　　Explaining Policies to Solve Difficulties
    Checking and Eliminating Wasteland in Various Parts of Southern Hebei
    [Southern Hebei News] According to statistics from some villages in Yongzhi, Xiazhen, Jingxian, and Yuanchao counties, there are a total of 29,680 mu of green and white wasteland. The reasons for the wasteland are roughly as follows: (1) Many villages have not distributed the land cleared during the land reform in a timely and reasonable manner. In villages where land has been distributed, many small pieces of land or alkaline depressions remain. Some people are unwilling to cultivate the land because it is poor, thus leaving the land uncultivated. (2) The land of some landlords and rich peasants has not been distributed, and the instruction of "whoever cultivates it, harvests it" has not been earnestly implemented. They are taking a wait-and-see attitude and are not actively engaged in production. Landlords and rich peasants who have been thoroughly liquidated face production difficulties, which have not been properly resolved in a timely manner, and therefore cannot cultivate the land well even if they have it. (3) For the land of elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled individuals, as well as the families of military personnel, workers, and martyrs who lack labor, necessary substitute farming or assistance has not been provided in some cases. (4) The land of famine refugees, or the land reserved for them, has not been distributed to farmers for cultivation in accordance with the principle of "whoever cultivates it, harvests it." Wasteland is also caused by enemy disasters and natural disasters. (5) There is bureaucracy among leaders who thought the masses would produce on their own, relaxing organizational leadership and failing to promptly detect and effectively address various problems in production. After discovering this problem, the leading organs in various regions have now begun to check and eliminate wasteland. According to incomplete statistics from Chengci, Yongzhi, and Linzhang counties, 5,000 mu of wasteland have been eliminated and seedlings have been planted. Yongzhi's third and fifth districts have adopted three methods for eliminating wasteland: (1) After group discussions among the masses, it was proposed that "whoever is willing to cultivate it, whoever can cultivate it, should cultivate it." It was determined that land ownership would remain with the original owner, but in order to rush planting and prevent wasteland, it was stipulated that those with more labor should cultivate more land. Using this method, more than 3 qing of wasteland were distributed in two days. (2) Some villages with fewer livestock divided the wasteland among the farmers' association's groups for collective cultivation and harvesting. Twelve-li Village had a total of 38 mu of wasteland, which was divided and cultivated by the thirtieth group. (3) For individual villages with a large amount of wasteland and difficulty in reclaiming it, the land was collectively cultivated by the farmers' association. The Farmers' Association has collectively reclaimed 30 mu of wasteland in Zhao Fang Village, which had 90 mu of wasteland. The Gucheng County Committee proposed conducting a village-by-village and household-by-household inspection of wasteland, mobilizing the masses to help wasteland households cultivate land through mutual aid and exchange of labor, or using leasing and sub-planting methods to solve the difficulties in eliminating wasteland. The Wuben Village of the sixth district of Linzhang County stipulated methods for eliminating wasteland, mutual assistance, and exchanging land at the meetings of the Farmers' Association members and organization: If you plow one mu of land for me, I will weed two mu of seedlings for you; for plowing wasteland for the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled, the livestock providing households will receive all the grass for the year (the method of equivalent exchange of labor should be determined voluntarily by both parties, and it is inappropriate for the Farmers' Association members and group leaders alone to decide – Editor). In order to quickly and thoroughly eliminate wasteland, the Southern Hebei Daily published a short commentary based on the above situation, calling on "Earnestly Check and Eliminate Wasteland!" It pointed out that it is not too late to sow before the hot weather arrives, and all regions should earnestly check and eliminate wasteland. All land cleared during the land reform that has not yet been distributed should be distributed quickly, fairly, and reasonably. The land reserved for famine refugees should be distributed to farmers for cultivation according to the principle of only paying the burden and not the rental price. With the approval of the district, the burden on sandy alkaline land can be reduced or waived. The policy of "no burden for one year of cultivated wasteland, no burden for three years of raw wasteland, and no inclusion of raw wasteland in equal distribution and supplementary allocation" should be widely publicized to eliminate ideological obstacles among the masses. Village cadres and Party members should take the lead in production and implement exchange of labor and mutual assistance under the principles of voluntary association and equivalent exchange to solve the difficulties of labor and livestock. Appropriate care should be given to the families of military personnel, workers, martyrs, and poor elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled. Mobilize, persuade, and compel landlords and lazy people to participate in labor.

　　说明政策解决困难
    冀南各地查荒灭荒
    【冀南讯】据永智、夏津、景县、元朝等县一部分村庄统计，共有青、白荒地二万九千六百八十亩。荒地原因大约有以下几个：（一）不少村庄清算出的土地未及时合理分配，已经分配的村庄，也剩下许多小块地或硷洼地，有些人嫌地坏不愿种，因而把地荒了。（二）有些地主富农土地，未被分配，亦未认真执行“谁种谁收”指示，而心从观望，不积极生产。已彻底清算的地主富农，因生产有困难，未及时适当解决，有地也不能好好耕种。（三）对缺乏劳力的老弱孤寡及军、工、烈属的地，有的没有进行必要的代耕或帮助。（四）逃荒户的土地，或给逃荒户保留的土地，没有按照“谁种谁收”的原则，分配给农民耕种。也有是因为敌灾、天灾而荒的。（五）领导上存在着官僚作风，以为群众自己会生产，而放松了组织领导，对生产中的各种问题，没有及时发觉和有效的处理。各地领导机关发觉了这个问题后，现已开始着手进行查荒灭荒。据成磁、永智、临漳等县不完全统计，已消灭荒地五千亩，并种上苗。永智三、五区灭荒采取三种方法：（１）经群众分组讨论，提出“谁愿种谁能种谁就种”，确定地权仍归原主，但为了抢种不荒地，规定按劳力多的多种。用这种方法，在两天内分配荒地三顷多。（２）有的村牲口少，便把荒地分到农会各小组伙种伙收。十二里屯共有荒地三十八亩，由第三十组分种起来。（３）个别荒地多而开荒困难的村子，就归农会集体耕种。赵坊村九十亩荒地，农会已集体开荒三十亩。故城县委会提出挨村挨户进行查荒，发动群众以互助换工帮助荒地户种地，或用出租分种的办法，解决灭荒困难。临漳六区务本村在农会委员、组织会议上，定出灭荒互助换地办法，你给我犁一亩地，我给你锄二亩苗；给老弱孤寡犁荒地，出牲口户得全年的草（应由双方自愿定出等价换工办法，光是农会委员和小组长决定不妥当——编者）。为迅速彻底消灭荒地，冀南日报特根据上述情况发表短论，号召“认真查荒灭荒！”指出：伏天未到，播种尚不为晚，各地应认真检查与消灭荒地。凡清算出来尚未分配的土地，应迅速公平合理的分配。给逃荒户留的土地，应按照只交负担，不出租价的原则，有计划的分给农民耕种。沙硷地经区批准可减少负担或不负担。并应普遍宣传“开熟荒一年不负担，生荒三年不负担，开生荒不在平分抽补之列”的政策，消除群众思想障碍。号召村干、党员带头生产，在自愿结合与等价交换的原则下，实行换工互助，以解决劳力畜力困难。对军工烈属及贫苦老弱孤寡，要给以适当照顾。动员说服与强制地主、懒汉参加劳动。
