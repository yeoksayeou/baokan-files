　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS Shanghai, 3rd, reported, citing Viet Minh News Agency sources, that the Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Vo Nguyen Giap, stated in a statement to the press: Viet Minh's arms production is increasing daily, sufficient to continuously supply the armed forces. Despite the lack of industrial equipment, the output of various types of modern weapons is increasing daily.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS Moscow, 2nd, reported: Izvestia recently published an article entitled "Behind the Smoke Screen of the So-Called Franco-Vietnamese Agreement," stating that because the offensive launched by the French colonial army against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ended in failure, and because of the huge military expenditure required by the Vietnam War, France has had to resort to new conspiracies. What the French colonialists are pursuing is to force the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to accept an indenture treaty suitable for French monopoly capitalists. The French colonial group knows very well that the people's government led by Ho Chi Minh will not condescend to sign such a treaty. Therefore, France would rather deal with the puppet government they have already established. But when the French colonialists did this, they failed to estimate the great changes that had taken place in the colonial countries after the defeat of German and Japanese fascism. Nguyen Van Xuan, this French lackey, has no and cannot have any significant political force to support him; while Ho Chi Minh's government has the support of the masses of the Vietnamese people.

　　越盟军火生产增加
    胡志明政府获广大人民支持
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社上海三日电引越盟新闻处消息称：越南民主共和国国防部长武元甲在其向报界发表的声明中说：越盟之军火生产正日益增加中，足够不间断地供应武装部队。尽管工业装备缺乏，但各种式样的现代武器的出品，数量日有增加。
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：消息报顷以“在所谓法越协定的烟幕背后”为题著论称：由于法国殖民军对越南民主共和国发动的攻势归于失败，由于越南战争所需的浩大军费，法国已不得不诉诸新的阴谋。法国殖民者所追求的，就是强迫越南民主共和国接受适合于法国垄断资本家的卖身条约。法国殖民集团熟知，胡志明领导的人民政府是不会屈身签订这样的条约的。因此，法国就宁愿与他们已经成立的走狗政府打交道。但是法国殖民者这样做的时候，却未能估计到德、日法西斯主义战败后在殖民地国家中所发生的大变化。阮文春这个法国的走狗，已没有而且不可能有任何重大的政治力量支持他；而胡志明的政府，则有越南人民大众的支持。
