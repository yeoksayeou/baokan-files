[Ji Lu Yu News] Our Dongming and Kaocheng local armed forces actively annihilated the enemy in coordination with the Kaifeng campaign. When our main force attacked Kaifeng, the Kaocheng County Brigade ambushed a platoon of the enemy's rearguard troops supporting Kaifeng in Matouxi, District 1, on the 24th. None of the enemy's more than 40 soldiers escaped, and all were captured. We seized 35 long and short guns and a batch of ammunition. That night, a certain unit also seized a cart of enemy artillery shells from a transportation team. Our Dongming local armed forces and militia launched a mopping-up campaign against the puppet Dongming county government that had fled into the countryside. On the 19th, more than 10 members of our local armed forces fought the enemy in ×× Village, capturing the puppet Dongming County Magistrate Wen Deheng and 10 others, and seizing seven long and short guns. On the 18th, our county brigade mopped up local bandits at Xu Jiedi, capturing 22 enemies, killing and wounding 33, and seizing 12 rifles, two telephones, and 3.7 billion Chiang currency. On the same day, a militia squad from our Eighth District ambushed scattered bandits near Duan Village, capturing 18 enemies, killing one, and seizing 12 rifles. Another militia unit also captured three enemies in the mopping-up campaign.
