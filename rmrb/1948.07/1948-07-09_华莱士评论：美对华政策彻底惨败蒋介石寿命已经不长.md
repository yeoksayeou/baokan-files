　　Wallace Comments:
    U.S. Policy Toward China a Complete Failure, Chiang Kai-shek's Days are Numbered
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th】According to a June 30th Agence France-Presse dispatch: U.S. Third Party presidential candidate Henry Wallace wrote in the latest issue of "The New Republic" magazine that America's policy toward China is a complete and utter failure. Knowledgeable Chinese all know that Chiang Kai-shek's days are numbered. American-trademarked planes and artillery that help the Kuomintang have turned the Chinese people's hatred of the Kuomintang toward the United States. According to an Associated Press dispatch: Wallace, speaking at the Political Academy in Brunswick, Maine, on June 30th, condemned Republican presidential candidate Dewey for being "willing to support the reactionary group in China." He said, "I don't think he knows anything about China; the masses of China do not support the current regime" (referring to the Chiang regime). "I am certain that the weapons being sent to China will pass through the Kuomintang and fall into the hands of the Communists."

　　华莱士评论：
    美对华政策彻底惨败蒋介石寿命已经不长
    【新华社陕北六日电】据法新社六月三十日电：美第三党总统候选人华莱士在最近一期的“新共和”杂志上撰文称：美国的对华政策是彻底的惨败了。有知识的中国人均知蒋介石的寿命已经不远。帮助国民党的美国商标的飞机和大炮，将中国人民对国民党的仇恨转向了美国。又据美联社电称：华莱士六月三十日在缅因州布伦斯维克的政治学院发表演说时，谴责共和党总统候选人杜威“情愿支持中国的反动集团”。他说，我并不认为他知道中国的任何事情，中国的群众并不拥护现政权（按指蒋政权）。我确信正在送往中国的武器，将经过国民党落入共产党手中。
