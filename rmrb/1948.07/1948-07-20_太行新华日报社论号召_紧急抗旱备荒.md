　　Taihang Xinhua Daily Editorial Calls for
    Emergency Drought Resistance and Famine Preparation
    [Taihang Dispatch] The Xinhua Daily here published an editorial entitled "Take Urgent Action to Launch a Struggle Against Drought and Prepare for Famine," which stated: Since the beginning of summer, there has been a prolonged drought with no rain. Throughout the region, except for some areas in the second and third special districts, drought conditions have already formed. In some areas, autumn crops have not been completely sown after the wheat harvest, and in other areas, although they have been sown, the autumn seedlings are obviously suffering from drought and may even wither. Many counties have also discovered locusts and various insect pests. Initially, the masses were anxious and waited for rain, and then actively took action to carry out drought resistance activities. However, some are still waiting. It continued: Our region had a poor harvest last year, and 700,000 people were plunged into famine this spring. Although the spring famine has passed, the summer famine has not completely passed in areas with low wheat production. If drought causes a poor harvest, these areas will fall into continuous famine. We should not passively wait for rain, nor should we rely on heaven for food. We must take active action to fight to overcome the drought. We have already passed Xiaoshu (the 11th solar term), and the season does not allow us to wait. The editorial stated: In areas where drought has already formed, drought resistance and famine preparation should be immediately regarded as the most central work of the great production movement, and the main strength of cadres should be focused on leading the masses to carry out the struggle against drought and famine preparation. In places where locusts are serious, locust control should be treated as the current central work in the same way as drought resistance and famine preparation. We must oppose complacency and waiting in the face of the fight against drought and locusts. The leadership in Shexian, Neiqiu and other places in the first, fifth and sixth special districts has already made such arrangements. This is a correct, timely and appropriate measure. We call on leading cadres at all levels, all party members, and labor heroes to actively lead and promote the masses with their infinite loyalty to the Party and the people, and to complete this urgent and important task. In the specific work of drought resistance and famine preparation, various places have made some achievements. We must draw on our rich historical experience based on the current situation. We must build small-scale water conservancy projects, repair canals and dig wells, and use all possible water to irrigate and protect seedlings. We must carry water to plant seeds, especially to water melons. Our slogan is "Water as many acres as you can, and keep every plant alive." In areas where the above conditions do not exist, dry planting should be advocated, and late seeds such as sorghum, millet, buckwheat, and rapeseed should be prepared. At the same time, wells, kilns, ponds, and dry canals should be repaired to prepare for water storage after rain. We must advocate more hoeing and shallow hoeing to maintain small seedlings. After rain in various places, we must seize the opportunity to plant seeds in a concentrated manner. In places where locusts or other insect pests are found, they must be immediately eliminated. We must carry forward the experience of Shahe and Cixian: "Come quickly, destroy quickly." In these tasks, mutual aid teams and cooperatives should actively participate and give full play to the power of organization. We must call on women, children, and old men to work together to make up for the shortage of main labor. Especially in the first special district, the two tasks of drought resistance and participation in the war are very urgent, and it is even more necessary to give full play to the power of organization. The border areas should unify the struggle against drought, famine preparation, and locust control with the struggle against the enemy. In the process of drought resistance and famine preparation in various places, it is necessary to develop textiles, transportation, and various kinds of sideline production according to the specific circumstances, to earn money to buy food and bran, and to make up for possible poor harvests. All departments of the Party, government, army, and people, and all the masses, must advocate thrift and oppose waste, and resolutely correct the phenomenon of excessive eating and drinking after the wheat harvest. We should advocate mixing bran with food and eating wild vegetables, and collecting and drying wild vegetables. Neiqiu has stipulated that each staff member should save two ounces of rice per day, and each person in the masses should save one he (a unit of dry measure) of rice per day. This spirit is worth learning from in various places.

　　太行新华日报社论号召
    紧急抗旱备荒
    【太行电】此间新华日报以“紧张行动起来，开展抗旱备荒斗争”为题发表社论，首称：入夏以来，久旱不雨，全区除二、三专区局部地区外，旱象已成。有的地区麦收后秋苗尚未完全下种，有的地区虽已下种，但秋苗显已受旱，甚至将要枯死。不少县份且发现蝗虫以及各种虫害。各地群众起初是心情焦灼，等待下雨，继而积极行动起来，进行抗旱活动。但有的仍在等待。继称：我区去年歉收，今春有七十万群众陷于灾荒。现春荒虽已渡过，但产麦少的地区，夏荒尚未完全渡过。如果因天旱造成歉收，在这些地区就会陷于连续灾荒。我们不要消极等雨，不要靠天吃饭，要积极行动起来，为战胜旱灾而斗争。现在已交小暑，节令已不容我们等待了。社论称：凡旱象已经形成的地区，要立即把抗旱备荒当作大生产运动最中心的工作，并把干部力量主要放在领导群众进行抗旱备荒斗争上。蝗虫严重地方，应将打蝗与抗旱备荒工作同样作为当前的中心工作。反对在抗旱与剿蝗斗争面前麻痹等待。一、五、六专区涉县、内邱等地，领导上都已经这样安排了，这是正确及时的适当措施。我们号召各级领导干部、全体党员及劳动英雄，以自己对党对人民的无限忠心，积极领导推动群众，完成这一紧急而重大的任务。在抗旱备荒的具体工作上，各地已做出了一些成绩，我们要根据现在的情况，发挥过去丰富的历史经验。要兴修小型水利，修渠打井，利用一切可能利用的水来浇苗保苗。要担水点种，特别要担水浇瓜。我们的口号是“能浇几亩浇几亩，浇活一棵是一棵”。凡是没有上述条件的地区，要提倡干种，要准备黍稷、荞麦、菜籽等晚种子；同时也要修井、修窑、修池、修旱渠，准备雨后蓄水。要提倡多锄浅锄，保养小苗。各地下雨后，要抓紧突击下种。在发现蝗虫或其他虫害地方，要马上扑灭。要发扬沙河、磁县的经验：“来的快，灭的快”。在这些工作上，互助组和合作社要积极活动，发挥组织起来的伟力。要号召妇女儿童老汉一齐动手，补救主要劳力之不足。特别在一专区，抗旱与参战两个任务都很紧迫，更要发挥组织起来的力量。边沿地区要把抗备旱荒剿蝗斗争与对敌斗争统一起来进行。各地在抗旱备荒中，要根据具体情况，发展纺织、运输以及各色各样的副业生产，赚钱买粮买糠，弥补可能的歉收。党政军民一切部门、全体群众，更要提倡节约，反对浪费，要坚决纠正麦收后某些大吃大喝现象。提倡掺糠吃野菜，采晒野菜。内邱已订出机关人员每人每日节省米二两、群众每人每日节省米一合，这种精神值得各地学习。
