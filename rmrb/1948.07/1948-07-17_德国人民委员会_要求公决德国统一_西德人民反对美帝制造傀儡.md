　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS reports: The Presidium of the German People's Committee sent a letter on the 8th to the Allied Control Council and the commanders of the occupying forces in Germany, requesting the enactment of laws clearly stipulating the German unification demanded by the national movement, or the promulgation of instructions to hold a national referendum on this issue. The letter points out that among the names in the national signature campaign to strive for German unification, fifteen million are German citizens with the right to vote, accounting for 37% of all German voters, which has reached the statutory quota (Note: The German Weimar Constitution stipulates that if 10% of the voters request a national referendum on certain bills, it must be held). The German People's Committee also requested that the national referendum be held on a Sunday in September this year. Representatives of the German Socialist Unity Party reported to the German People's Congress at the beginning of the month on the results of the nationwide popular referendum, stating that approximately 25 million Germans voted in favor of unification, which is strong evidence in favor of maintaining German national unity.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS reports: U.S. imperialism and its British and French partners are intensifying the creation of a West German puppet state. The international observer of the Soviet newspaper Pravda wrote on the 5th: "Important negotiations have been held in Frankfurt (Note: located in the northwestern part of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany, the headquarters of the U.S. occupying forces). The military governors of the western occupation zones held a secret meeting on June 30. The next day, they held a meeting with the prime ministers of the West German states. The U.S. representatives played the leading role in these talks. The issues discussed included: revising the borders of the West German states, establishing a 'Ruhr State,' establishing the so-called 'Rhine Federal State,' abolishing the Hesse State Constitution (which contains clauses on industrial socialization) and the rights of the industrial committee, which have long been dissatisfied with the U.S. occupying authorities. The American 'protectors,' with the help of their British and French partners, are repeatedly cutting Germany according to their own tastes." According to information obtained by the Pravda reporter in Berlin: At the secret meeting in Frankfurt, Clay announced that Saar was "no longer German territory"; Robertson added that the state borders would be revised "in accordance with tradition." In order to reward Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg for their obedience to the United States, the London Conference decided to cede the Selfkant, Borkum Island, the mouth of the Ems River, and the Venlo area from West Germany to the Netherlands, and Belgium and Luxembourg also received several pieces of land. After the Frankfurt meeting, the prime ministers of the eleven West German states were ordered to discuss in Koblenz the plan submitted by the U.S., British, and French authorities to establish a "West German state."
　　The conspiracy to create a West German puppet state has been strongly opposed by the West German people. The Central Committee of the Socialist People's Party of Germany (West German Communist Party) issued a statement saying: Germany does not need a "West German state," does not need a forced federal system, and does not need occupation laws, but only desires a unified Germany, self-determination, a just peace treaty, and an end to the occupation.

### 德国人民委员会　要求公决德国统一　西德人民反对美帝制造傀儡

　　德国人民委员会
    要求公决德国统一
    西德人民反对美帝制造傀儡
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社报导：德国人民委员会主席团于八日致函盟国管制委员会和德境占领军司令，请求颁布法律，明确规定全国运动所要求的德国统一，或颁布训令，举行关于这一问题的全民公决。该函指出：在争取德国统一的全国签名运动的名单中，有一千五百万人是有选举权的德国公民，即占全德选民的百分之三十七，这已到达法定的名额（按：德国威玛宪法规定：如百分之十的选民要求对某些法案举行全民公决，则必须举行之）。德国人民委员会并要求在今年九月择一星期日举行全民公决。德国统一社会党代表于月初向德国人民会议报告全德范围人民复决投票的结果称：投票赞成统一的德国人约二千五百万，这是赞成保持德国全国统一的有力证明。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社报导：美帝国主义及其英法伙伴，正在加紧制造西德傀儡国家。苏联真理报国际观察家于五日著文称：“重要谈判已在法兰克福（按在德国美占区西北部，美占领军总部所在地）举行。西部占领区军事总督于六月三十日曾举行秘密会议。次日，他们与西德各州总理进行会议。美代表在这些会谈中担任主角。讨论的问题有：修改西德各州边界，设立‘鲁尔州’，建立所谓‘莱茵联邦州’，取消黑森州宪法（这一宪法载有工业社会化的条款）和很久以来就为美占领当局所不满的工业委员会的权利。美国‘保护人’在英法伙伴帮助之下，一再按照他们自己的胃口来切割德国”。又据真理报驻柏林记者获息：在这次法兰克福的秘密会议上，克莱宣布萨尔已“再不是德国的领土”；罗伯逊补充说：州的边界将“依照传统”加以修改。为了酬偿比、荷、卢对美国的顺从，伦敦会议曾决定把德荷交界处的磐史因、伯肯姆岛、埃姆斯河口和文洛城地区自西德割给荷兰，比利时和卢森堡也都得到几块土地。法兰克福会议之后，西德十一州总理奉命在科不林士商讨美英法当局提交的建立“西德国家”的方案。
    制造西德傀儡国家的阴谋，已遭到西德人民的强烈反对。德国社会主义人民党（西德共产党）中央特为此发表声明说：德国不需要“西德国家”，不需要强迫的联邦制，也不需要占领法规，只愿望统一的德国，自决权，公正的和约和结束占领。
