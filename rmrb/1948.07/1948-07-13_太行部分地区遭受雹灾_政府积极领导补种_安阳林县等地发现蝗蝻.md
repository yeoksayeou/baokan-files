Taihang News: Parts of Lucheng, Heshun, Pingshun, and Zhangnan counties were recently struck by hailstorms around the 20th of last month, causing heavy damage to wheat and autumn seedlings. Local democratic governments are dispatching personnel to comfort the affected masses, issue loans to solve seed shortages, and organize the rescue and replanting of seedlings. Statistics from 14 villages in the fourth and fifth districts of Lucheng show that more than 7,100 mu of wheat and more than 15,600 mu of autumn seedlings were destroyed. The wheat harvest was greatly reduced, with severely affected areas yielding only 20% of the crop. In the first and seventh districts of Heshun, 13 villages suffered hailstorms across more than 3,200 mu. Parts of the fifth and sixth districts were also affected. Twelve administrative villages in the second district of Pingshun suffered damage. In Nansai, Chidi and other four villages alone, 226 mu of wheat fields were affected, reducing yields by four-fifths. More than ten villages in the seventh district of Zhangnan suffered hailstorms at noon on the 21st. The next morning, County Head Bai personally went to the affected areas to comfort the masses, and allocated loans of 1.6 million yuan (Jizhao currency, same below) and more than 1,000 jin of jade, water caltrop and bean seeds to solve the difficulties of replanting for the masses. Heshun has sent special personnel to issue loans of 2 million yuan to solve the seed difficulties for the masses and seize the opportunity to carry out replanting. After comforting the masses to understand the disaster situation, the head of the Lucheng County Government Cooperative Section immediately convened a mass meeting to discuss the situation. Everyone came up with methods such as supporting seedlings and replanting. The seed problem was solved by mutual borrowing among the masses and the cooperative section taking responsibility for coordination. Now the masses are actively replanting autumn seedlings and harvesting the damaged wheat. Wang Keze, deputy district head of the second district of Pingshun, went to the villages to comfort the masses, and organized sideline production and replanting as soon as the hailstorm had just stopped. Village cadres in Nansai took the initiative to clearly divide the work and lead the masses to formulate a production and saving plan to overcome the famine, replant autumn fields, eliminate cooked wasteland, plant naked oats, open up wasteland to plant late vegetables, collect wild vegetables, and organize transportation, weaving, and medicinal herb digging to save and overcome the famine.

This newspaper reports: Locust nymphs were discovered in Anyang, Linxian, Shahe, Cixian and other counties in Taihang in late June, damaging more than 7,000 mu of green seedlings. In Xigang Village and Xiaobeigou in the first district of Anyang, the affected area exceeded 100 mu; a single area in the south of Shuiye had more than 600 mu affected; the villages of Beima, Nantongye and others in the second district, the area around Donghuiying in the fourth district, Qugou in the fifth district, Shijian and Fucheng in the sixth district, and Dongxi Shangzhuang and other villages in the eighth district were also successively discovered to be affected. More than 3,000 mu of grain seedlings have been eaten away in Matoujian, Lishigejian, Fen'ao, Baitou and other villages in the ninth district. More than 900 mu of nineteen villages in the seventh district have been eaten up. At the junction of Xinsizhuang, Xizuo Village, Niu'erzhuang, Shangguanzhuang and other villages in the eighth district of Cixian, locust nymphs were discovered and have damaged more than ten qing of green seedlings. Grasshoppers were discovered in the eighth and ninth districts of Linxian, and the ninth district ate more than 1,000 mu of autumn seedlings. Locust nymphs were also discovered in Dalianzhen in the sixth district of Shahe, damaging up to more than 900 mu of small seedlings. According to veteran farmers, the reason for the occurrence of locust nymphs this year is that the wheat fields were not plowed after intercropping last year, and there was no shortage of rain this spring, and the land was wet and the weather was hot, which is suitable for the development of locust nymphs. The counties where locust nymphs have been discovered are actively organizing capture and eradication. The special commissioner's office has also notified the counties to quickly inspect and organize the masses to eliminate the locust plague in the nymph stage. The seventh district of Anyang has organized a locust eradication headquarters, and the joint defense has established a branch headquarters to lead women and children in capture and eradication. More than 1,100 people from thirteen villages in the seventh district of Cixian participated in locust fighting. Since the 23rd of last month, 60% of the locust nymphs have been eliminated in two days.

　　太行部分地区遭受雹灾
    政府积极领导补种
    安阳林县等地发现蝗蝻
    【太行讯】上月二十日前后，潞城、和顺、平顺、漳南等县部分地区突遭雹灾，麦子秋苗损失甚重，各地民主政府正派员安慰受灾群众，发放贷款，解决种子困难，组织救苗补种。潞城四、五两区十四个村统计，打毁麦子七千一百多亩，秋苗一万五千六百多亩，麦子收成大减，灾重者只收十分之二。和顺一、七两区十三个村，被雹灾面积三千二百多亩。五、六两区也有部分村庄受害。平顺二区十二个行政村遭灾。仅南赛、池底等四村被灾麦田二百二十六亩，减收五分之四。漳南七区十余村于二十一日中午遭雹灾，次日上午白县长亲自到受灾区安慰群众，并拨贷款一百六十万元（冀钞，下同），玉菱、豆种千余斤，解决群众补种的困难。和顺已派专人发放二百万元贷款，解决群众种子困难，抓紧时机进行补种。潞城县府合作科长于慰问了解群众的受灾情况后，马上召开群众大会讨论，大家想出扶苗、补种等办法。种子问题，采取群众互借和合作科负责调剂的办法解决。现群众正积极补种秋苗，收割被打毁的麦子。平顺二区副区长王科则等在冰雹刚下罢了，就涉水下乡，到被灾各村去安慰群众，组织副业与补种。南赛村干部亲自动手，明确分工，带领群众订出生产节约渡荒计划，补种秋地，消灭熟荒，种莜麦，开荒种晚菜，采野菜，组织运输、纺织、刨药材等生产，节约渡荒。
    【本报讯】太行安（阳）、林（县）、沙（河）、磁（县）等县在六月下旬发现蝗蝻，吃坏青苗七千余亩。安阳一区西岗村、小背沟受灾面积有百多亩；水冶南关一片即有六百余亩；二区北马、南铜冶等村，四区东灰营一带，五区曲沟，六区石涧、阜城等村，八区东西上庄等村也先后发现。九区马投涧、李史葛涧、坟凹、白塔等村已被吃坏谷苗三千多亩。七区十九个村被吃光的有九百多亩。磁县八区辛寺庄、西佐村、牛二庄、上官庄等村交界处发现蝗蝻，已吃坏青苗十顷多。林县八、九两区发现蚂蚱，九区吃了秋苗一千多亩。沙河六区褡裢镇亦发现蝗蝻，吃坏小苗达九百多亩。据老农谈：今年发生蝗蝻原因，系因去年麦地串种没有犁地，今春雨水不缺，地湿天热，适合蝗蝻发展。发现蝗蝻县份，正积极组织捕打，专署亦通报各县，迅速检查，组织群众把蝗灾消灭在蝗蝻阶段。安阳七区已组织剿蝗指挥部，联防成立分指挥部，领导妇女儿童进行捕打。磁县七区十三个村参加打蝗者有一千一百多人，上月二十三日开始，两天已消灭蝗蝻百分之六十。
