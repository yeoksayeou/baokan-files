　　Mobilizing Auxiliary Labor to Participate in Farming
  　Houshan Village Saves Labor in Weeding
    [Taihang Telegram] In Houshan Village, Fucheng District, Lingchuan, under the active leadership and promotion of cadres and party members, half-auxiliary labor was organized to participate in farming, and a strict work-point system was implemented, saving 724 workdays in weeding. The village originally planned to weed more than 1,380 mu of millet in twelve days, but it was completed in nine and a half days. One hundred women and children participated in weeding (compared to the usual 45 people), helping to weed a total of 547 mu of fields. They also took on all the miscellaneous tasks such as pushing the mill, grinding grain, and carrying water, saving a lot of male labor. In weeding, fixed labor was separated from flexible distribution, and equal value exchange was implemented, which improved labor efficiency. When the elderly were carrying manure and sowing seeds, they generally counted as half a labor force; but when weeding, because of their high skills and good weeding, they were upgraded to the same work-point value as a full labor force. The work-point method was determined through democratic discussion, on-the-spot inspection, and decisions on increasing or decreasing points. The work-point system was very strict: tickets were issued three times a day—early morning, late morning, and afternoon. Settlements were made immediately after the work was completed. Everyone was satisfied and worked hard. The production committee implemented collective leadership for weeding, with responsibility assigned by street, daily inspections, reports, exchanges of experience, and problem-solving. After party rectification, the awareness of branch party members has been raised, and they are now able to promote the masses through their own exemplary leading role. Party members Zhang Hu, Xingxi, and others took the lead in calling people early and leading the weeding in the mutual aid group, and helped the group leader plan work and solve problems, which promoted the entire group and changed some of the past dissatisfaction of the masses with party members, and strengthened the relationship between party members and the masses. During weeding, the production enthusiasm of the groups with party members participating was particularly high.

　　发动辅助劳力参加耕作
  　后山村锄苗省工
    【太行电】陵川附城区后山村在干部与党员积极领导推动下，组织半辅劳力参加耕作，严格实行工票制度，锄苗中省工七百二十四个。该村原计划十二天锄谷一千三百八十余亩，结果九天半就完成了。参加锄苗的妇女儿童有一百人（较经常四十五人），合计帮助锄田五百四十七亩。且把推碾磨、担水等杂活全部担负起来，节省出许多男工。锄苗中实行死工活分，等价交换，提高了劳动效率。老年人在担粪下种时，一般顶半个劳力；但在锄苗时，因为技术高、锄的好，即提高到和全劳力一样记分。记分办法是经过民主讨论，就地检查，决定分数的增减。工票制度很严格：清早、前晌、后晌，一天三开票。生活做完即结算存欠。大家满意，干得有劲。生产委员会对锄苗实行集体领导，分街负责，每日检查汇报交流经验，解决问题。支部党员经过整党，觉悟提高，已能用自己的模范带头作用推动群众。党员张虎、兴喜等，在互助组内起早叫人，领头锄苗，并帮助小组长计划活计，解决问题，推动了全组，转变了过去群众对党员某些不满，密切了党员与群众的关系。锄苗中，凡有党员参加的小组，生产情绪即表现得分外高。
