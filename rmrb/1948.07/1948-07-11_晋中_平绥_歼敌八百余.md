Jinzhong·PingSui
    Annihilating Over Eight Hundred Enemies

    [North Yue News] (Delayed) Two battalions, numbering about five hundred men, of the enemy's Second Security Regiment guarding Datong, sallied forth from Datong on June 16th, attempting to set up strongholds at Julebao (a station on the PingSui Railway). They were ambushed by our unit near Yujia Mountain (east of Zhoushizhuang Station). After two hours of fierce fighting, the majority of the enemy were annihilated or captured. It is estimated that over eighty enemy soldiers, including the regimental commander Gao Kejing, were killed, over sixty bandits were wounded, and one hundred and seventy enemy soldiers were captured. The spoils included one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, fourteen small cannons, one hundred and twenty rifles, two pistols, over ten thousand rounds of ammunition, and one hundred and fifty-nine hand grenades.
