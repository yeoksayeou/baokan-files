Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Comprehensive reports from various sources: Students in Peiping bravely broke through the Chiang government's martial law to hold a solemn demonstration and a memorial service to accuse and protest the monstrous crime of the Chiang and Fu cliques in creating the "July 5th Massacre," which resulted in the deaths and injuries of over a hundred students. On the morning of the 9th of this month, over ten thousand students (according to the Associated Press report) from seventeen universities and middle schools in Peiping and those who had come to Peiping from the Northeast, held "the largest demonstration ever seen here" (United Press). The marching crowd carried wreaths, sang the mournful elegy of the "July 5th" martyrs, and shouted just slogans along the way such as "Arrest and execute the murderer Fu Tso-yi," "Execute Chen Jicheng" (note: Chen is the Peiping Garrison Commander, one of the main culprits in this massacre), "The Bandit Suppression Headquarters is the People Suppression Headquarters," "Oppose the government's policy of suppressing the people," and "Give us back the blood of the fourteen martyrs." The students wrote anti-massacre slogans and cartoons in chalk on the shops and vehicles along the street. The students claimed that the number of students killed in the "July 5th Massacre" had increased to fourteen and pointed out that "the July 5th incident was the result of Fu Tso-yi ordering the army to open fire when necessary" (Associated Press).

At about 9:00 AM, the student march gathered at the residence of the pseudo-Vice President Li Zongren on North Chang Street and sent representatives to petition, putting forward several solemn demands: "Severely punish Fu Tso-yi," "Unconditionally release the students arrested in the July 5th Massacre," "Lift martial law," "Immediately establish Northeastern Provisional University and Northeastern Provisional Middle School to accommodate all Northeastern students in public and private universities and middle schools in Peiping and provide them with public funding," and "Give generous compensation to the families of the deceased students, be responsible for the medical expenses of the injured, and the funeral expenses of the deceased." Li Zongren prevaricated in every possible way, "but did not agree to do anything" (United Press).

After the petition yielded no results, the marching crowd, disregarding the Chiang government's re-implementation of emergency martial law and the encirclement of them by thousands of military police and armored vehicles, marched in formation through the main streets, and accused the Chiang and Fu cliques with slogans, songs, and mutual question-and-answer sessions.

At 5:00 PM, the marching crowd returned to the Democracy Square of Peking University and, regardless of the encirclement by a large number of fully armed military police, held the "Northeast and North China Students' Protest Against the July 5th Massacre Memorial and Accusation Meeting." The entire audience was filled with grief and anger. "One student's speech targeted the Kuomintang authorities. He said, 'You fawn on American imperialism, you hold the constitution in your left hand and an American dagger in your right hand, you are the enemy of the people.' His speech received particularly warm applause." (Associated Press)

In addition: According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 9th, the student unions of thirteen universities in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan have submitted a letter of protest to Fu Tso-yi. The Northeastern Association in Peiping published "The Truth about the Unfortunate July 5th Incident," protesting this massacre and refuting the slanderous rumors fabricated by the Central News Agency and the Peiping Chiang-controlled Municipal Council.

　　控诉蒋傅匪帮屠杀罪行
    北平万余学生大示威
    游行队伍携带花圈高唱悲壮挽歌沿途高呼“枪毙凶手傅作义！”
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合各方消息：北平学生英勇冲破蒋政府戒严令，举行悲壮的示威游行及追悼控诉大会，抗议蒋、傅匪帮制造“七、五惨案”，毙伤学生百余人的滔天罪行。本月九日晨，北平及东北来平的共十七个大中学学生万余人（据美联社报导），举行“此间前所未见的最大示威”（合众社）。游行队伍携带花圈，高唱悲壮的“七、五”烈士挽歌，沿途高呼“逮捕并枪毙凶手傅作义”、“枪毙陈继承”（按陈系北平警备司令，此次惨案主凶之一）、“剿匪总部即剿民总部”、“反对政府剿民政策”、“还我十四烈士血来”等正义口号，在沿街店铺及车辆上以粉笔书写反屠杀标语、漫画。学生们声称“七、五惨案”死亡学生已增至十四名，并指出：“七、五事件是傅作义命令军队于必要时开枪的结果”（美联社）。
    九时许，学生游行队伍群集北长街伪副总统李宗仁住宅，派出代表请愿，提出：“严惩傅作义”、“无条件释放七、五惨案中被捕同学”、“撤消戒严令”、“立即成立东北临大、临中，收容所有东北来平公私立大中学生，并一律给予公费”及“厚恤死难同学家属，负责伤者医药费，死者治丧费”等几项严正要求，李宗仁百般敷衍，“但却没有答应做任何事情”（合众社）。
    请愿未得结果后，游行队伍不顾蒋政府再度实施紧急戒严及成千军警与装甲车对他们的包围，整队经过各主要街道，并以口号、歌声及互相问答方式对蒋、傅匪帮进行控诉。
    下午五时，游行队伍返回北大民主广场，不顾大量全副武装军警的包围，举行“东北、华北学生抗议七、五惨案哀悼控诉大会”，全场情绪悲愤激昂，“一位学生的演说以国民党当局为目标，他说：“你对美帝国主义摇尾乞怜，你左手拿着宪法，右手拿着美国匕首，你是人民的敌人”。他的演说得到特别热烈的掌声。”（美联社）
    又讯：据路透社南京九日电报导，平、津、唐山十三所大学学生自治会，已向傅作义提出抗议书。东北旅平同乡会发表“七、五不幸事件真相”，抗议此一惨案及驳斥谣言工厂中央社及北平蒋记市参议会的诬蔑造谣。
