Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Free Greece Radio broadcast: On the 12th, the Greek Royalist Fascist army, coordinated with artillery and air force, threw all newly formed divisions and auxiliary forces into the battle in the northern region of the Pindus Mountains. The Royalist Fascist army fired more than 30,000 shells, but all offensives were repelled by the Democratic Army. The commander of the 35th Brigade of the Royalist Fascist army, Panao Dou, was killed, and some battalions lost nine-tenths of their strength. Enemy offensives in other areas were also repelled. According to preliminary statistics: The Royalist Fascist army suffered 458 deaths, 723 injuries, and 73 captured in these battles. According to another broadcast from Free Greece Radio: Under the victorious resistance of the Democratic Army, the 9th Division of the Royalist Fascist army, which launched an offensive in the Konitsa area on the 14th, ignored orders from its headquarters and halted its offensive. Royalist Fascist army prisoners confessed that the 528th Battalion, led by Major Sepour Iopopoulos, refused to attack the Democratic Army, resulting in the immediate removal of the entire 43rd Brigade, which is now being reorganized.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: TASS dispatch of the 15th, citing a broadcast from Free Greece Radio: A communiqué from the Greek Democratic Government stated: The Provisional People's Democratic Government of Free Greece has announced its willingness to accept any proposal, from any source, aimed at establishing peace in Greece and bringing about meetings on a sincere and democratic basis. Six weeks have passed, but the Athens government, which has sold itself to the Americans, has interpreted our statement as a sign of weakness of the Democratic Army and, following the orders of its American masters, has rejected our proposal. The Royalist Fascist army thought that, together with their American masters, a resolute offensive would defeat the Democratic Army. Since June 14th, we have launched fierce offensives many times in the northern Pindus Mountains; the developments of the past month have demonstrated the invincible strength of the Democratic Army and the weakness of the Royalist Fascist army. At this critical juncture, the Provisional People's Democratic Government of Free Greece hereby reiterates its previous statement, willing to accept any agreement based on sincerity and democracy that will bring peace to the Greek people. The Democratic Government calls on all Greeks to work together to achieve this goal. We especially urge the deceived officers and soldiers in the "National Guard" to rise up against the crimes of the traitors in Athens and join forces with the Democratic Army to establish a just, independent, and democratic Greece.

　　希民主军粉碎敌进攻
  　击毙敌旅长歼敌共千余
  　民主政府重申和平意愿
    【新华社陕北廿三日电】自由希腊电台广播：十二日希保皇法西斯军，在炮兵与空军配合下，把一切新编的师和辅助部队都投入平都斯山北部地区的战斗中。保皇法西斯军发射了三万余发炮弹，但所有进攻都被民主军击退，保皇法西斯军第三十五旅旅长潘纳奥杜被击毙，若干营的兵力损失了十分之九。敌人在其他地方的进攻也都被击退。据初步统计：保皇法西斯军在这些战斗中死四百五十八名，伤七百二十三名，被俘七十三名。另据自由希腊电台广播：在民主军胜利阻击下，十四日在科尼柴地区发动攻势的保皇法西斯军第九师，不顾其总部的命令，已停止进攻。保皇法西斯军俘虏供称：以塞泡尔约泡洛斯少校为首的第五百二十八营，拒绝进攻民主军，结果第四十三旅全部立即被调走，现正改编中。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社十五日电引自由希腊电台广播：希腊民主政府公报称：自由希腊临时人民民主政府宣布，愿意接受不论来自何方只要是旨在建立希腊和平，并带来在诚恳与民主基础上的会议的任何建议以来，已为时六周了，然而卖身投靠美国人的雅典政府，却把我们的声明解释为民主军软弱的标志，并遵从其美国主子的命令，拒绝了我们的建议。保皇法西斯军以为和他们的美国主子一起用坚决的攻势会击败民主军。自六月十四日以来，我们已在平都斯山北部多次发动猛烈进攻；一月来的发展，已说明民主军不可征服的力量与保皇法西斯军的软弱。际此决定关头，自由希腊临时人民民主政府，兹特重申前言，愿意接受会给希腊人民带来和平的任何以诚恳与民主为基础的协议，民主政府号召一切希腊人协力达成这一目标。特地促请“国民警卫队”中受骗的军官与士兵，起来反对雅典卖国贼的罪恶，会同民主军建立公正独立民主的希腊。
