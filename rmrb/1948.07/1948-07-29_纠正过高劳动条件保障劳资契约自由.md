　　Correcting Overly High Labor Condition Guarantees and Labor-Management Freedom of Contract
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China Industry and Commerce Conference, regarding the issues of labor-management, owner-employee, and master-apprentice relationships in private industry and commerce, launched discussions based on the principle of mutual benefit for both labor and capital. Addressing past shortcomings and existing problems, the following principles were established: First, guarantee the freedom of contract for both labor-management, owner-employee, and master-apprentice parties. Create new contracts based on the equality of both parties in personality and mutual benefit, replacing old contracts that created inequality in personality for workers and shop assistants. Upon the expiration of the contract, either party has the right to terminate the contract in accordance with the law. Correct the phenomenon of violating freedom of contract that has occurred in some places in the past, such as prohibiting dismissal according to contract, forcing employment, and unilaterally stipulating wages by any party. Second, basically recognize the old wage system and labor-capital profit-sharing system, but make appropriate and necessary modifications to correct errors such as excessively high wages, excessively high labor profit-sharing, and excessively high labor conditions implemented in some places in the past. Third, recognize the old working hour system, but the working hours of workers employed by some private industrial and mining enterprises are too long, and those whose regular working hours exceed twelve hours should be corrected. Correct the phenomenon in some places of stipulating too many holidays, and workers and shop assistants attending meetings occupying production time and delaying production and business. However, factories should provide workers, shop assistants, and apprentices with necessary rest and sleep time to recover from fatigue and maintain health. Factories should agree that workers, shop assistants, and apprentices use their spare time to participate in various meetings and extracurricular studies organized by the trade union. Fourth, recognize the old master-apprentice relationship and improve it. Abolish the system of corporal punishment for apprentices. The apprenticeship period is generally still three years, but if the apprentice's technical ability has reached the level of a craftsman or shop assistant before the term expires, the term should be shortened. The original system of compensating the master in handicrafts is allowed to be preserved, and its term should be appropriately shortened. Fifth, in larger factories, it is encouraged to establish a factory affairs committee under the leadership of the manager (subject to the factory's consent), and absorb representatives of workers, staff, and technicians to participate, and democratically discuss various issues related to production plans and labor treatment, work, and living systems, and absorb their correct opinions, but the final decision-making power on production plans rests with the manager. Workers and shop assistants should abide by factory and shop rules and respect the manager's leadership in business.

　　纠正过高劳动条件保障劳资契约自由
    【本报讯】华北工商业会议，对于私营工商业中劳资、东伙、师徒关系问题，根据劳资两利的方针，展开讨论，针对着过去的缺点及现存的问题，确定了以下几条原则。第一、保障劳资、东伙、师徒双方的契约自由，制造旧的对工人店员在人格上不平等的契约，实行在双方人格平等与两利基础之上的新的契约。契约期满，任何一方皆有依法解约之权。纠正过去某些地方曾经发生过的禁止依约解雇、强迫雇佣、及任何方面片面规定工资等违反契约自由的现象。第二、基本上承认旧有的工资制度与劳资分红制度，但作适当的必要的修改，纠正过去某些地方实行过高工资，过高的劳力分红与过高的劳动条件等错误。第三、承认旧有的工时制度，但有些民营工矿雇用工人工时过长，经常劳动时间超过十二小时以上者，应予纠正。纠正某些地方曾规定过多的假日，工人店员开会侵占生产时间，耽误生产与营业的现象。但厂方应给工人、店员、学徒以必要的休息睡眠时间，使能恢复疲劳，保持健康。厂方应同意工人店员学徒利用业余时间参加工会组织的各种会议与业余学习。第四、承认旧有的师徒关系，并加以改进。废除对学徒的体罚制度。学徒期限一般仍为三年，但年限未满，其技术能力已到达工匠或店员水平者，年限应当缩短。在手工业中原有的酬师制度准予保存，其年限应适当缩短。第五、在较大工厂中，提倡在经理领导下成立厂务委员会（须经厂方同意），吸收工人、职员、技师代表参加，民主讨论有关生产计划及劳动待遇、工作、生活制度的各项问题，吸收他们的正确意见，但关于生产计划之最后决定权在经理。工人与店员应当遵守厂规铺规，尊重经理在业务上的领导。
