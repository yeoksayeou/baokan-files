　　Soviet Construction Snippets

　　△ Soviet machine manufacturing factories have recently produced many new types of machines. The Sverdlovsk factory produced a type of motorcycle for railway work, each capable of towing six flatbed platforms with a load of 120 tons. An improved automatic unloading truck can replace 200 laborers. Large electric excavators capable of digging one million tons of coal or iron per year are being widely adopted. There is also a large excavator whose work is equivalent to that of 1,200 earth-digging tools. More than 150 new types of agricultural machines are being manufactured, including self-propelled grain combines, beet combines, and hay mowers.

　　△ The Soviet timber industry is undergoing thorough mechanization. Sawmills are widely using electric saws that can fell trees in 20-30 seconds. More than 13,000 kilometers of narrow-gauge railways are being laid around various mechanical timber factories. As a result of mechanization, work can be done in the boundless forests from the Urals and Siberia to the Far East, regardless of the season. [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th]

　　苏联建设零讯
    △苏联机器制造工厂最近出产许多新式机器。斯维德洛夫斯克工厂出产一种铁路工作用的摩托车，每辆可以拖载重一百二十吨的平板台六个，有一种改良的自动卸货车能抵二百个人工。每年能挖一百万吨煤或铁的大电力掘挖机，被广泛采用着。又有一种大挖土机，其所作的工程等于一千二百个掘土器。一百五十多种新式农业机器正在制造中，其中有自动推进的谷类联合收割机，甜菜联合收割机和刹草机。
    △苏联木材工业正在彻底机械化中。木材厂广泛采用二三十秒钟内伐倒树木的电锯。一万三千多公里的窄轨铁路，正围绕着各机械木材厂铺设。机械化的结果，从乌拉尔、西伯利亚到远东的无边的森林中不论季节，都可以工作。【新华社陕北十四日电】
