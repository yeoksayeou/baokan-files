Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Reports from various sources: 40,000 coal miners belonging to U.S. Steel Corporation began a strike on the 6th. The strike includes the company's mines in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Utah, and Colorado, and is "progressing steadily" (TASS). Thousands of miners from other commercial coal mines, disregarding the dissuasion of upper-level union members, are also staging sympathy strikes. All seventeen coal mines owned by the Pittsburgh Coal Company have been closed, and coal production in all mines in western Pennsylvania has sharply decreased by 70 percent in the first day of the strike. The reason for the strike is that the capitalists demanded the cancellation of the provision in the contract that "workers must join the union within a certain period of time after being hired," while the miners insisted on defending this right of the union, otherwise they would refuse to work. In other news: More than 30,000 workers of the United Farm Equipment Workers Union, affiliated with the CIO, went on strike on June 29 at twelve factories of International Harvester Company to oppose the company's unreasonable proposals to amend the contract.

　　保卫工人加入工会权利
    美矿工四万罢工
    农具工人三万余亦举行罢工
    【新华社陕北十二日电】各方报导：美国钢公司所属的煤矿矿工四万人，已于六日开始罢工。罢工包括该公司在宾夕凡尼亚、西佛吉尼亚、肯塔基、阿拉巴马、犹他及科罗拉多等州的各个矿井，并“正有增无减地进行中”（塔斯社）。其他商业煤矿的成千矿工，不顾工会上层分子的劝阻，亦纷纷举行同情罢工。匹兹堡煤业公司所有的十七个煤矿，已全部关闭，宾州西部全部矿井的煤产量，在罢工后第一日中已锐减百分之七十。罢工原因为资方要求取消合同中关于“工人受雇后一定时间内须加入工会”的规定，而矿工则坚持保卫工会此项权利，否则即拒绝工作。又讯：产联所属的联合农具工会工人三万余名，已于六月二十九日在万国农具公司的十二个工厂内举行罢工，以反对公司方面修改合同的无理建议。
