Notice from the Propaganda Department of the CCP Jilu Yu Region Committee:
    Strengthening Cadre Policy Study
    [Jilu Yu News] The Propaganda Department of the CCP Jilu Yu Region Committee issued a notice on organizing study for cadres within the Party. The notice pointed out: The reason why our Jilu Yu Region has seen the emergence of "leftist" adventurist deviations during land reform is mainly due to unclear leadership thinking and undefined policy boundaries. In implementing certain specific Party policies, the overall line and general policies of the Party are sometimes forgotten. In order to resolutely, correctly, and unreservedly implement all the lines and policies of our Party Central Committee, and to raise awareness and improve work, organizing and leading Party cadres in study should become one of the current political tasks. In the future, work reports from higher and lower levels should include information on cadre study, and the quality of each cadre's study should be listed as one of the criteria for evaluating work performance. It is stipulated that the following four documents should be the central documents for study by cadres at all levels: "Central Committee's 1948 Instructions on Land Reform and Party Rectification," the *North China People's Daily* editorial "The Current Tasks of the North China Liberated Area," "Preface to the Reprint of *Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder*," and "*Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder*, Chapter Two," and "Lenin on How Soviet Officials Should Work." The study period will be one month to one and a half months. The study method mainly involves understanding the spirit and essence of the documents, connecting with reality, connecting with oneself, and conducting work and ideological self-criticism. The Hebei Construction Region will adhere to and restore the two-hour study system, with most studying collectively. Henan and border regions will adopt a study day system or a rotating study system, where part of the staff works and part studies. Cadres above the district level will focus on self-study, while those below the district level will adopt the method of large lectures. Village-level and individual small-area cadres will undergo short-term rotational training, organized by the county. Responsible comrades of Party committees at all levels and administrative heads of all departments must lead by example and take the lead personally. Party committees' directly affiliated organs will establish study committees based on general branches or branches, and study groups will be combined with Party life groups. A first report will be made half a month after the start of the study, and a summary report will be made at the end of the month.

　　冀鲁豫区党委宣传部通知
    加强干部政策学习
    【冀鲁豫讯】冀鲁豫区党委宣传部发出关于组织党内干部学习的通知。指出：我冀鲁豫区在土改中所以发生左倾冒险主义的偏向，主要是由于领导思想不明确，政策界限划不清，在执行党的某种具体政策时，有时忘记党的总路线和总政策。为了坚决的、正确的、毫无保留的执行我党中央的全部路线政策，并提高觉悟、改进工作，今后组织与领导党内干部学习，应成为当前政治任务之一。今后上下级工作汇报应有干部学习情况，并将每一干部学习好坏列为考核工作成绩的标准之一。并规定：“中央一九四八年土改工作与整党工作指示”，华北人民日报“华北解放区的当前任务”社论，“重印左派幼稚病前言”及“左派幼稚病第二章”、“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”四文件为各级干部学习的中心文件。学习时间为一个月至一个半月。学习方法主要是领会文件精神实质，联系实际，联系自己，进行工作及思想检查。河北建设区坚持与恢复两小时学习制，大部集体学习。河南和边沿区采取学习日制或一部工作一部学习的轮番学习制。区以上干部着重自学，区以下采取上大课的方式。村级及个别小区干部，以县为单位，实行短期轮训。各级党委负责同志及各部门行政首长，必须以身作则亲自领导。各级党委直属机关，以总支或支部为单位建立学委会，学习小组与党的生活小组合而为一。学习开始半月后作第一次报告，月终作学习总结报告。
