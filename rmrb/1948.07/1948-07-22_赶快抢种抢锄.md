　　It has rained thoroughly in various places. Seizing the time for planting and replanting is the most important thing right now. Those who haven't planted must hurry to plant, those with uneven seedlings must fill in the gaps, and weeds that have grown must be quickly removed... There can be no relaxation. Some villages in Yangcheng County, Taiyue District, seized the time to prepare for planting when it was raining. Mutual aid teams discussed planting methods, prepared farm tools, adjusted seeds, and organized labor. As soon as the rain stopped, they started working immediately without delay. We should also learn from this approach, planting quickly and well, and weeding in a timely manner. After the rain, weeds grow fiercely like tigers, so we must not be careless and let the land go to waste.

    各地已落透雨，抢种补种，是当前顶重要的事情。没种的要抢种，苗不齐的要补齐，草长起来了也要快锄……一点不能放松。太岳区阳城有些村在下雨时，就抓紧抢种准备，各互助组讨论了抢种办法，准备农具调剂种子，组织劳力，雨一停止，马上干，一点不误事。咱们也应学习这个作法，种得快种得好，锄草也及时，雨后草长猛似虎，可不敢马虎荒了地。
