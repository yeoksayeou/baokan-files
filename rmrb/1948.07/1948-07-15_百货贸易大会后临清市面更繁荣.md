(Jinan News) Since the commodity trade conference in April, the market in Linqing City has become more prosperous. Many industrial and commercial businesses have established new storefronts in the streets and alleys. Many residences in Yushi Lane, Houying Lane, Nianzi Lane, and Zhima Lane have opened warehouses and pharmacies. Some residents in Daning Lane have even converted the back walls of their houses into storefronts and opened shops. The Dasi Temple Bazaar and the Dongjia Courtyard Bazaar have become a continuous area. Some businesses cannot find market space and are requesting the municipal government to find solutions. In order to expand the market in a planned way and promote economic prosperity, the Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request to the municipal government to open new streets and new markets. The municipal government is actively planning this. In order to expand operations, various industrial and commercial households have recently added 177 apprentices and shop assistants. Managers of companies like Tongxingde Tea House, who previously fled to the Jiang-occupied areas, have also returned one after another to resume business. Many merchants from the Jiang-occupied areas, having personally witnessed the concrete situation of our Party's protection and development of industry and commerce at the April trade conference, have come to the city to do business.
