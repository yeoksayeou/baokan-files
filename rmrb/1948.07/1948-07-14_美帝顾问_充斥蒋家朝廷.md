Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 11th - According to news from newspapers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the number of American advisors in the Chiang Kai-shek government is constantly increasing. Dade, the former head of the Textile Group at the US military headquarters in Japan, flew to Shanghai on May 27th to take up the post of advisor to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee of the Kuomintang's Ministry of Economic Affairs. An American named Colonel Ike has become an advisor to the Police General Administration of the Kuomintang's Ministry of Interior. Ike accompanied the head of the administration, the Kuomintang secret service chief Tang Zong, to Fuzhou and Xiamen in the middle of last month for inspection. An American named Bailey has become an advisor to the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Communications. Furthermore, according to a Taiwan dispatch published in the Qingdao Civilian Daily on April 14th, "all departments of the Kuomintang-run 'Taiwan Sugar Factory' have American advisors." American advisors have great power in the Chiang Kai-shek government, can move around at will, and enjoy the highest待遇. A man named Pond, who is currently an advisor to the Kuomintang's Ministry of Judicial Administration, led a judicial inspection group from the Chiang Kai-shek government to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places for investigation last month. As revealed by the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on June 15th, Pond's monthly salary is 2,500 US dollars (equivalent to approximately 11.75 billion Chiang Kai-shek currency at the current black market exchange rate for the US dollar), equal to the total salary of 200 Chinese judges or 400 Chinese judicial police officers. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, Dade's monthly salary also reaches 1,500 US dollars. Their待遇 is higher than the salary income of the US Vice President and cabinet ministers. According to the 1945 American Yearbook, the monthly salary of the US Vice President and cabinet ministers is 1,250 US dollars.
