　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Reports from various sources: The news of the assassination attempt on Communist leader Togliatti immediately aroused anger and excitement among the Italian people, and demonstrations and strikes protesting this assassination plot broke out in various places. Workers in Italy's largest cities—Rome, Milan, Genoa, and Turin—immediately held a general strike upon hearing of the incident. In the capital, Rome, shops closed quickly after receiving orders from the General Confederation of Labor. Except for left-wing newspapers, which continued to publish as usual, printing workers at other newspaper offices left their posts without notifying the factory. Buses stopped running midway. Laboring people everywhere held demonstrations. Attempts by the military police and fascists to interfere provoked the demonstrators, leading to bloody clashes. In Pisa, the masses beat to death fascists who opened fire on demonstrators; in Naples, angry crowds attacked the headquarters of the fascist organization "Italian Social Movement" and clashed with the police; in Turin, workers occupied factories. The Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor passed a resolution calling for a nationwide general strike starting on the night of the 14th to protest the vicious plot to assassinate the leader of the laboring people. Unità (the Italian Communist Party's newspaper) and Avanti! (the Socialist Party's newspaper) issued extra editions. Unità declared: "This is the bloody result of the anti-communist movement launched by the Gasperi government." According to a TASS report, the reactionary Gasperi government has ordered all counties to take strict measures and resolutely prohibit any demonstrations.
