In the appendix of the eleventh issue of the magazine "World Economy and World Politics," which was published not long ago, was published a stenographic record of a debate on F. Varga's book "Changes in the Capitalist Economy Caused by the Second World War." This debate was held at a joint meeting of the Political Economy Department of the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Political Economy Department of Moscow State Lomonosov University.

The goal of the discussion was to determine the correctness of the various issues concerning modern capitalism and its development prospects as expounded in Comrade Varga's book.

During the debate, Comrade Varga said in his address: "If you ask me whether I think it is necessary to correct some theoretical viewpoints one and a half years later (referring to the time after the publication of Varga's book – translator's note), (apart from the issue of the characteristics of people's democracy) I should answer, comrades, no need."

Many speeches by well-known economists correctly criticized many basic arguments in Comrade Varga's book, exposing the serious political and theoretical errors contained in the book. However, some speeches attempted to defend the obvious non-Marxist viewpoints in Comrade Varga's book. It should be noted that Comrade Varga still believed that it was unnecessary to criticize these fundamental errors when the discussion record was published half a year later.

What conclusions did Comrade Varga draw when examining the current stage of the general crisis of capitalism? According to his opinion, what is the most essential change in the capitalist economy after the Second World War?

Comrade Varga's book unexpectedly starts from the question of the role of the state in the economies of capitalist countries. It is unexpected because readers reasonably believe that it is first necessary to analyze the wartime economy of capitalist countries, the laws of its development, the internal contradictions of monopoly capitalism and their forms of expression. Only after this can we understand the role of the bourgeois state in the economy.

Marxists do not deny the reactive effect of the bourgeois state on the economy. Marxists believe that the capitalist economy does not rely on the state, but develops according to spontaneous laws. Under no circumstances can the bourgeois state play a decisive role in the development of the capitalist economy.

Comrade Varga, however, draws a different conclusion: "One of the main phenomena of the Second World War is that in all bourgeois countries—belligerent and neutral—the state acquired a decisive significance in the wartime economy." (Page 15)

During the debate, Comrade Varga not only insisted on this view, but also gave a broader explanation. He said: "My statement about the reduction of the state's role after the war may not be entirely correct." From his speech, it can be interpreted that the bourgeois state acquired a decisive significance not only in the wartime economy, but also in the post-war economy.

For any Marxist, as long as he is a true Marxist, he will understand that the theory of the decisive role of the bourgeois state (i.e., only in terms of the wartime economy) is equivalent to denying the role of the spontaneous economic development laws of capitalism; it is equivalent to saying that the capitalist wartime economy does not develop according to this law, but according to the omnipotent will of the state, and will continue to develop in this way for a long time to come. Starting from this point, one can reach the following conclusion: the bourgeois state can overcome the spontaneous action of the law of value, the general law of capital accumulation, the law of proletarian impoverishment, crises and unemployment, and may even become planned.

Comrade Varga stated in his address that the theory that economic planning under capitalist conditions is impossible is outdated, and attempted to prove the opposite argument. He said: "Let me discuss the issue of planning under capitalist conditions. On this issue, we are often dominated by old theories: believing that we can achieve a planned economy, but in capitalism, the anarchy of production permanently and indiscriminately dominates everything. I think this way of looking at the problem is wrong." According to Comrade Varga, the economy of capitalist countries is advancing on some kind of "planned basis," and organizations similar to our unique "State Planning Commission" have also appeared in some capitalist countries.

The fundamental error that Comrade Varga made in estimating the role of the bourgeois state in the economy lies in the fact that he observes this issue by separating it from monopoly capitalism, and even opposes the state to the monopoly. Comrade Varga wrote: "The bourgeois state represents the interests of the entire bourgeoisie. Its goal is to try to properly utilize the state's entire resources for the purpose of war, and therefore it is constantly in conflict with the partial interests of individual capital enterprises and their pursuit of high profits." (Page 10)

The book repeatedly emphasizes the existence of contradictions between the state and the monopoly during the war. The debate correctly pointed out that this view would lead to the conclusion of recognizing the supra-class nature of the bourgeois state.

The modern state in imperialist countries manifests as the dictatorship of capitalists—monopolists and financial oligarchies. When examining state-controlled economies, one must not forget that it is for the purpose of maximizing profits, realized by monopolists through the state. Comrade Stalin said: "Although there is a 'democratic' parliament, many capitalist governments are ruled by big banks. Parliament wants to make people believe that they supervise the government, but in fact, the government officials themselves and their actions are ruled by big financial groups." (Collected Works of Leninism, 10th edition, page 174)

The essential characteristic of monopoly capitalism is manifested in the integration of state institutions and capital monopolies, giants of finance capital, and the plunderers of monopoly capital using state institutions to obtain high extra profits.

The essence of the economic changes in capitalist countries during the Second World War is manifested in the extremely increased role of capitalist monopolies using state institutions to seize new sales markets and raw materials to divide the world. The main driving force of the wartime economy is capitalist monopolies, and the policies of the bourgeois state are subordinate to its interests, and the latter has no ability to slightly oppose the interests of capitalist monopolies and financial oligarchies. If the bourgeois state slightly exceeds the scope of monopoly interests when formulating plans, it will inevitably be doomed to failure.

Comrade Varga explained during the debate: "The state had to try to impose some restrictions on profits during the war" and the state's regulation of prices "was not for the benefit of the monopoly." These statements are inconsistent with the facts. In fact, the profits of capitalist monopolies during the war were far greater than usual. What kind of state restrictions on capitalists are there when American monopoly capitalists increased their profits from 6.4 billion US dollars in 1939 to 24.5 billion US dollars in 1943, and earned 87 billion US dollars under the counteraction of the government during the four years of the war!

Furthermore, the leaders of the American wartime economy themselves denied the "decisive role of the state in the economy." The debate cited a section from the book "Arsenal of Democracy: The History of U.S. Munitions Production" by Donald Nelson, the head of the U.S. War Production Board. Nelson wrote: "Industry tells us its needs and when it needs them. We can only formulate the kind of regulations that industry wants. This proposition is the decisive factor."

The speeches in the debate concerning the role of the state under monopoly capitalism cannot be ignored. The speech by Tuolaha Tianbeierge (脱拉哈·天培尔戈) was completely wrong. He had previously overestimated the role of the bourgeois state in the economy. In this debate, he supported Comrade Varga's erroneous arguments. For example, he said: "It must be admitted the principle of state intervention in the economy." In fact, Tuolaha Tianbeierge (脱拉哈·天培尔戈) fell into the position of bourgeois apologist with this view, deviating from the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the role of the bourgeois state.

When Evuntov (埃闻托夫) participated in the debate to defend Varga's views, he completely fell into extremely obvious bourgeois theories. He believes that "the state does not directly interfere in the issue of exploitation of the proletariat." His understanding is unconditional. He repeated this view, which is completely supported by the servants of the bourgeoisie—reformists, twice during his speech. With this view, Evuntov (埃闻托夫) distorted the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the bourgeois state. As is well known, the bourgeois state is a tool for exploiters to oppress the laboring masses.

When Smid (斯米德) talked about the combination process of huge monopoly capital and the state, he believed that this process means that a certain movement is constantly being completed that is moving towards a new stage or a new stage of development. Is a new stage of monopoly capitalism possible? This is not a new question. Lenin gave a very detailed answer in the struggle against Kautsky's theory of ultra-imperialism. Monopoly capitalism is the latest and final stage of capitalist development, the eve of the socialist revolution. The trend of creating state monopoly capitalism and military state monopoly capitalism forms between wars is the manifestation of the basic contradictions and essence of monopoly capitalism. It does not form a special new stage of capitalist development.

Monopoly capitalism in this form is the highest stage of production socialization that can be achieved under capitalist conditions. Lenin wrote: "The imperialist war is the eve of the socialist revolution. This is not only because the disasters caused by the war produce proletarian uprisings—if socialism is not economically mature, then no uprising will create socialism—but because state monopoly capitalism is the most perfect material preparation for socialism, the threshold for entering socialism, a stage on the historical ladder such that there are no intermediate stages between this stage and the one called socialism." (Collected Works of Lenin, Vol. 21, p. 187) Capitalism has reached a mature stage in the time of the general crisis of capitalism.

　　关于一个经济学问题的论战
    依·拉甫捷夫
    不久以前出版的“世界经济与世界政治”杂志第十一期的附录，曾发表了争论Ｆ·瓦尔加的著书“第二次世界大战所引起的资本主义经济的变化”的速记记录。这个争论是在苏联科学院经济研究院政治经济部、和莫斯科国立罗姆诺索夫大学的政治经济系的联席会上举行的。
    讨论的目标是为了判明瓦尔加同志书中所阐述的现代资本主义及其发展前途的各种问题之正确程度如何。
    争论时瓦尔加同志在致辞中曾说：“如果你们问我在一年半以后（指瓦氏著书出版后——译者注）是否认为必须改正某种理论上的观点，（除了论述人民民主特质的问题以外）我应该答道，同志们，不需要。”
    许多著名的经济学者的发言都对瓦尔加同志书中的很多基本论点加以正确的批判，揭露了该书中含有的政治上理论上的严重错误。但是一部分的发言却企图辩护瓦尔加同志书中的明显的非马克思主义的观点。应当注意：瓦尔加同志在半年后出版讨论记录时，仍然认为批评这些原则上的错误是不必要的。
    瓦尔加同志检讨资本主义总危机的现阶段时曾得出何种结论呢？按照他的意见，第二次世界大战后资本主义经济变化中最本质的又是什么呢？
    瓦尔加同志的著书完全出乎意料地从国家在资本主义各国经济中的作用的问题出发。它是出乎意料的。因为读者合理的认为首先需要分析资本主义国家的战时经济、它的发展的规律，独占资本主义的内在矛盾及其表现的形式。只有如此之后，才能了解资产阶级国家在经济中的作用。
    马克思主义者不否认资产阶级国家对经济的反作用。马克思主义者认为资本主义经济并不依靠国家，乃是根据自发法则而发展的。资产阶级国家在任何条件下也不能在资本主义经济发展上起决定的意义。
    瓦尔加同志却得出另外的结论：“第二次世界大战的主要现象之一，便是在一切资产阶级国家内——交战国与屯立国，国家在战时经济上获得了决定的意义。”（一五页）
    在争论时瓦尔加同志不仅坚持这个主张，而且加以更广泛的解释。他说：“我的关于战争结束后国家的作用将会减少的论述或者不完全正确。”从他的发言可以解释为：资产阶级国家不但在战时经济里，而且在战后经济里也获得了决定的意义。
    对于任何马克思主义者，只要他是真正的马克思主义者，便会了解资产阶级国家的决定作用的理论（即仅就战时经济而言）就等于否认资本主义自发经济发展规律的作用；等于说资本主义战时经济不根据这规律，而是按照万能的国家意志而发展的，并且今后也要长久如此地发展。从这点出发，便能够到达了如下的结论：资产阶级国家可以克服价值法则的自发作用、资本蓄积的总法则、无产阶级贫困化的法则、危机和失业，甚至可能变成计划性。
    瓦尔加同志在致辞中说明资本主义经济计划化不可能的理论业已陈旧，并企图证明相反的论据。他说：“让我来讨论在资本主义条件下计划性的问题。关于这问题，我们时常被旧理论所支配：认为我们能实现计划经济，但在资本主义则生产的无政府状态永久而无差别的支配一切。我认为这样看问题是不对的。”照瓦尔加同志的意见，资本主义国家的经济正在某种“计划性的基础上”前进着，在若干资本主义国家，类似我们独特的“国家计划委员会”的组织也出现了。
    瓦尔加同志在估计资产阶级国家在经济中的作用时所犯的基本错误，在于他离开资本主义独占而观察这一问题，甚至把国家和独占对立起来。瓦尔加同志写道：“资产阶级国家代表整个资产阶级的利益。他的目标是在战争目的之下，尽力适当地利用国家的全资源，因此便不断地与个别资本企业的局部利益，和他们追求高额利润的利害关系相冲突。”（一○页）
    书中更屡次强调在战时国家与独占间存在着矛盾。论战的发言中正确地指出这种见解会得出承认资产阶级国家的超阶级性的结论。
    现代国家在帝国主义的国度里表现为资本家——独占者和金融寡头制的专政。检讨国家统制经济时，不可忘记它是为了尽可能地追求高额利润，被独占者通过国家而实现的。斯大林同志说：“虽然存在着‘民主的’国会，但很多的资本主义政府被大银行统治。国会想使人们相信他们监督政府，而实际上政府的官员本身及其行动却被大的金融集团所统治。”（列宁主义问题第十版一七四页）
    独占资本主义的本质的特征表现于国家机构和资本独占，金融资本巨头的一体化，独占资本的掠夺者利用国家机构去获得高度额外利润。
    第二次世界大战资本主义国家的经济变化的本质，表现于为了攫取新销售市场和原料以分割世界，利用国家机构的资本主义独占的作用极为增大。战时经济的主要动力乃是资本主义独占，资产阶级国家的政策服从于它的利益，后者没有任何能力去稍有抵触于资本主义独占与金融寡头的利益。资产阶级国家在拟定计划时若稍微越过独占利益的范围，它就不可避免的要注定失败。
    瓦尔加同志在争论时说明：“国家在战时不得不设法对利润加以某种限制”及国家调节物价“不是为了独占的利益”。这些说法皆与事实不符。实际上，资本主义独占在战时的利润较之平时远为增大。当美国独占资本家增大其利润，从一九三九年的六十四亿美金到一九四三年的二百四十五亿美金，当四年战争之间在政府的反作用一下赚了八百七十亿美金的时候，还有什么国家对资本家的限制！
    并且，美国战时经济的领导者们本身就否认了“国家在经济上的决定作用”。论战时引用了美国军需生产管理局的负责人道纳尔·纳尔逊的“民主国家的兵工厂——美国军需生产的历史”书中的一节。纳尔逊写道：“工业告诉我们它的需要及其需要的时期。我们只能制定使工业所欲的那种法规。这个命题乃是决定的因素。”
    　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    不可忽视在论战里论及独占资本主义下国家的作用问题的发言。脱拉哈天培尔戈的发言完全是错误的。他以前就过高估计资产阶级国家在经济上的作用。这次论战他又支持了瓦尔加同志的错误论点。例如他说：“必须承认国家干涉经济的原则。”实际上脱拉哈天培尔戈就以这种观点堕落到资产阶级辩护人的立场，脱离了马列主义关于资产阶级国家作用的学说。
    参加论战的埃闻托夫辩护瓦尔加的观点时，完全陷于极其明显的资产阶级的理论。他认为“国家不直接干涉对无产阶级的剥削问题”。他这种认识是无条件的。发言时他又二次的重述这种完全为资产阶级的奴仆——改良主义者所拥护的观点。埃闻托夫以其这种观点曲解了马列主义关于资产阶级国家的学说。如众所周知，资产阶级国家乃是剥削者压迫劳动大众的工具。
    斯米德谈及巨大独占资本与国家的结合过程时，认为这过程意味着时刻在完成着趋向于新阶段或发展的新阶段的某种运动。独占资本主义发展的新阶段是否可能？这不是新问题。列宁在反对考茨基的超帝国主义理论的斗争里曾给以极为详尽的回答。独占资本主义是资本主义发展的最新而最后的阶段，是社会主义革命的前夜。在战争之间创设国家独占资本主义和军事国家独占资本主义形式的趋势，是独占资本主义的基本矛盾与本质的表现。它并不形成资本主义发展的特别新阶段。
    独占资本主义在这形式内，是在资本主义条件下所可能达到的生产社会化的最高阶段。列宁写道：“帝国主义战争是社会主义革命的前夜。这不只是因为战争所造成的惨祸产生出无产阶级的起义，——如果社会主义在经济上尚未成熟，那么任何起义也不会创造出社会主义，——而是因为国家垄断资本主义是社会主义最完满的物质准备，是进到社会主义的门阶，是历史梯子上这样的一级，即从这一级到称为社会主义的那一级之间是没有任何中间阶段的。”（列宁全集二十一卷一八七页）资本主义在资本主义总危机的时候已经到达了成熟的阶段。
