　　Circular of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Commemorating "July 1st" and "July 7th"
    This year's July 1st is the 27th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and July 7th is the 11th anniversary of the national war of resistance against Japanese imperialist aggression. The following are the regulations for the entire Party to commemorate these two anniversaries:
    (1) On July 1st, Party committees at all levels should convene meetings of Party cadres, general meetings of Party members, or commemorative meetings of activists. At this meeting, a brief report should be given on the 27-year history of the Party, explaining that the Communist Party of China, through its struggles in the period of the Great Revolution, the period of the Ten-Year Civil War, the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and this People's Liberation War, has developed from a small group of dozens of people into a fully mass-based party of over three million people. It has won the support of the broad masses of the people and is uniting workers, farmers, independent laborers, intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese across the country, consolidating the anti-Chiang national united front, carrying out the victorious People's Liberation War, and striving for the national victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution. The entire Party should be told: This historical development proves that the New Democratic Revolution advocated and implemented by the Communist Party of China, that is, the revolution led by the proletariat, of the masses of the people, and against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, is completely correct; it proves that the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms over this revolution is completely correct. The task of the entire Party today is to resolutely, correctly, and unreservedly implement all the lines and policies of our Party Central Committee, overcome all tendencies to deviate from the central line and policies, and tendencies of indiscipline, in order to achieve the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution as quickly as possible. To this end, Party committees at all levels should, in the coming period, use available time to focus on organizing Party cadres to study the central line and policies, especially various important documents published by the Party Central Committee and central comrades in recent times, and, in light of the actual conditions and specific work of various localities and departments, launch discussions to raise awareness and improve work.
    (2) On July 7th, Party committees at all levels should propose to the government and people's organizations to hold mass commemorations in appropriate forms and on an appropriate scale. In this commemoration, Communists should tell the people: how Japanese imperialism once invaded China; how the Chinese people united to resist and achieve victory; how American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek usurped the fruits of the Chinese people's victory and plunged the Chinese people into an unprecedented civil war; how American imperialism is actively invading China and supporting the revival of Japanese imperialism; and how the traitor Chiang Kai-shek is selling out China's national interests to American imperialism and Japanese imperialism. The people should be told that the main methods to restore China's national interests and resist the aggression of American and Japanese imperialism are to develop the national united front and the people's liberation struggle, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous regime, and establish a democratic coalition government; only in this way can the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation be guaranteed, and truly equal relations be established with all foreign countries.
    (3) Other methods of commemorating these two anniversaries may be decided by various localities according to specific circumstances. When conditions are appropriate and required by the masses, the two commemorations may also be held jointly.

　　中国共产党中央宣传部关于纪念“七一”和“七七”的通知
    今年的七月一日是中国共产党成立的二十七周年纪念日，七月七日是中国民族反抗日本帝国主义侵略的爱国战争十一周年纪念日。兹规定全党对于这两个纪念日的纪念办法如下：
    （一）在七月一日，各级党委应该召集党的干部会议或党员大会或活动分子的纪念会。在这个会上，应该简要地报告党的二十七年的历史，说明中国共产党经过大革命时期、十年内战时期、抗日战争时期、和这一次人民解放战争中的奋斗，已经由几十个人的小组发展为现在业已超过三百万人的完全群众化的大党，得到了广大人民的拥护，并正在团结着全国的工人、农民、独立劳动者、知识分子、自由资产阶级、开明绅士、少数民族和海外华侨，巩固反蒋的民族统一战线，进行胜利的人民解放战争，争取中国人民民主革命的全国胜利。应该告诉全党：这个历史的发展，证明中国共产党所主张和实行的新民主主义革命，即无产阶级领导的、人民大众的、反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的革命，是完全正确的；证明毛泽东同志及其战友们对于这个革命的领导，是完全正确的；全党今天的任务，就是坚决地、正确地、毫无保留地执行我党中央的全部路线和政策，克服一切离开中央路线政策的倾向和无纪律的倾向，以便尽可能迅速地达到中国人民民主革命的胜利。为此目的，各级党委应该在今后一个时期内，利用可能的时间，着重地组织党内干部对于中央的路线、政策的学习，特别是学习最近时期内党中央和中央同志所发表的各种重要文件，联系各地方各部门的实际情况和具体工作，展开讨论，提高觉悟，改进工作。
    （二）在七月七日，各级党委应该向政府和人民团体提议，举行适当形式和适当范围的群众纪念。在这个纪念中，共产党员应该告诉人民：日本帝国主义曾经怎样侵略中国；中国人民怎样团结抵抗并取得胜利；美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石怎样窃取中国人民的胜利果实，并把中国人民投入空前的内战；美帝国主义怎样积极侵略中国，并扶植日本帝国主义复活；以及卖国贼蒋介石怎样向美帝国主义和日本帝国主义出卖中国的民族利益。应该告诉人民：恢复中国民族利益，抵抗美日两帝国主义侵略的主要方法，就是发展民族统一战线和人民解放战斗，推翻蒋介石的卖国政权，成立民主联合政府；只有这样，才能保障中国民族的独立自由，并与一切外国建立真正平等的关系。
    （三）纪念这两个纪念日的其他方法，可由各地按照具体情况，自行决定。在条件适当并为群众所要求的时候，也可以将两个纪念合并举行。
