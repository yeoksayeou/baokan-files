    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th] TASS, Rome, 21st: The Presidium and Executive Committee of the Italian People's Democratic Front held a joint meeting to discuss the domestic situation caused by the Italian government's retaliatory and provocative actions following the general strike. They decided to launch a new movement, calling on all Italian democrats to "rise up to defend the infringed freedom of the Republic and support the persecuted." The People's Democratic Front has decided to establish a "National People's Solidarity Committee" to protect the interests of working people who have been arrested and interrogated for participating in the general strike. At the same time, it will organize a fundraising campaign to aid those persecuted by police terror and their families. The "National People's Solidarity Committee" will have broad participation from people of all social strata, and branches of the committee will be established throughout the country. The movement to support the victims is sweeping the nation. Newspapers report that democratic parties and organizations have donated more than one hundred million lira to aid the victims.
