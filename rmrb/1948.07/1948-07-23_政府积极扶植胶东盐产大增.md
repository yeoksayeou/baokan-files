Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: With government support, salt production in the Jiaodong coastal area has greatly increased. The Shidao Salt Industry Company pre-lent over 530,000 catties of grain and 80 million North Sea currency to salt farmers this spring to solve their living and production difficulties, and actively carry out production. The salt fields have now increased from 22,895 mu last year to 26,191 mu; the number of salt farmers has increased from 1,874 to 2,361. The salt production from March to the first half of June, a period of three and a half months, exceeded last year's total output (700,000 dan) by more than 76,000 dan (each dan being 100 catties). The five salt stations directly under the Weibei (newly established county, northern part of Weixian) Salt Office have a total of 188 salt flats and 1,024 salt farmers. After receiving 200,000 catties of grain loans from the democratic government, a large quantity of new salt has recently been harvested. The five stations can produce 250,000 dan of salt this year. The Rushan County (newly established county, eastern Haiyang, southern Muping) democratic government distributed over 400,000 catties of grain loans to salt farmers in Anjiagang Village. The village produced over 2,000 dan of salt in May, which can be exchanged for 18,000 catties of grain. The local democratic government, in order to encourage production, increased the price of salt purchased exclusively from five catties of corn per dan to seven catties. In Rongcheng, Xie Kou Island and other seven villages, there were originally 80 salt flats, and now 12 new ones have been added. The monthly salt production reached 76,772 dan, exceeding the total output of last year by 26.17 percent. The local salt industry company, in order to take care of foreign sales and make merchants profitable, not only does not increase any expenses for merchants, but also tries its best to reduce transportation costs. Now, purchases and sales in various places are showing improvement. In the first half of June, Shidao sold a total of over 37,000 dan of salt. The Hailidao Gong Shengxiang Trading Company recently transported 20,000 catties of salt to the outside, exchanging it for 120 catties of bean cake and 1,900 catties of corn, making a great profit. At the moment, other trading companies are also actively transporting and selling salt to the outside.

　　政府积极扶植胶东盐产大增
    【新华社华东十九日电】胶东沿海盐业在政府扶助下，盐产大增。石岛盐业公司今春预借该市盐民粮五十三万余斤，北海币八千余万元，解决盐民生活及生产困难，积极进行生产。现盐田已由去年二二、八九五亩，增至二六、一九一亩；盐民则由一、八七四人增至二、三六一人。从三月至六月上半月三个半月的盐产，即超过去年总产量（七十万担）达七万六千余担（每担百斤）。潍北（新设县，潍县北部）盐所的直属五个盐站共有盐滩一八八付，盐民一、○二四人，得到民主政府二十万斤贷粮后，日前新盐已大批出滩。五个站今年可产盐二十五万担。乳山县（新设县，海阳东部牟平南部）民主政府发放给安家港村盐民贷粮四十余万斤，该村五月份产盐二千余担，可换粮一万八千斤。当地民主政府为奖励生产，并将专买盐价由过去每担苞米五斤增至七斤。荣成斜口岛等七个村，原有盐滩八十付，现新增十二付，一个月产盐达七万六千七百七十二担，超过去年全年产量百分之二十六点一七。当地盐业公司为照顾外销，使商人有利可图，除对商人不增加任何费用外，并尽量设法将运费减低。现各地购销日见起色。六月上半月石岛已共销盐三万七千余担。海里岛公生祥商号日前向外运盐二万斤，换回豆饼一百二十斤，苞米一千九百斤，获利甚大。刻其他商号也纷纷向外运销。
