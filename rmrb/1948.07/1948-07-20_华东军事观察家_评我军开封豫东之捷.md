Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, July 17th: A military observer from the East China People's Liberation Army commented on the great victory in Kaifeng and the Eastern Henan Campaign. He pointed out that the PLA's capture of Kaifeng, annihilating 39,000 enemy troops, and the annihilation of over 50,000 troops from the Kuomintang bandit Qu Shounian, Huang Botao, and Qiu Qingquan corps in the Sui County area of Eastern Henan, capturing corps commander Qu Shounian and the 75th Division Commander Shen Chengnian alive, will play a significant role in continuing to eliminate the enemy's active forces in the Central Plains in large numbers, changing the Central Plains war situation, and further consolidating the construction of the Central Plains Liberated Area. The enemy, having suffered a painful blow, and facing the PLA's future, even more powerful offensive, will inevitably continue to abandon certain points and lines, and use the method of "patching up the east wall to mend the west," sending troops wherever there is an emergency, to barely support themselves. However, strategically, they will become even more passive, and their troop strength will inevitably be even more insufficient. Their attempt to concentrate a portion of their troops for a strategic defense-based tactical offensive, to engage in a seesaw struggle with us in the Central Plains, will also gradually decrease, and they will eventually be exhausted and unable to cope, leading to a fundamental change in the Central Plains war situation. At the same time, as a result of the enemy being forced to transfer troops from the Central China and Shandong battlefields to reinforce the Central Plains, it will be even more convenient for the PLA to conduct offensives smoothly on those battlefields. The observer went on to analyze the great significance of the PLA's capture of Kaifeng, which is not only military but also political, especially a great victory in policy. The observer stated: As the capital of Henan Province, a major military stronghold and the reactionary ruling nerve center of the Kuomintang bandits in the Central Plains, Kaifeng is a city that has been fortified for a long time. Chiang Kai-shek himself personally guaranteed to the puppet National Assembly representatives of Henan during his "Piglet National Congress" that it could not be lost. However, just as the Kuomintang bandits were gathering their large forces in southwestern Shandong, boasting about their so-called "mobile warfare," the PLA suddenly appeared under the walls of Kaifeng and captured it in one fell swoop, proving that no city heavily fortified by the Kuomintang bandits is impregnable. And the PLA's strategic initiative completely disrupted the Kuomintang bandits' troop deployment, forcing them to hastily transfer troops from various places to reinforce it. In addition to mobilizing almost all of the Kuomintang bandits' mobile forces in the Central Plains, even the 83rd Division, 72nd Division, 25th Division, and 63rd Division from central Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, Huainan, and Shandong were scraped together; however, they were all hundreds of miles away and were subjected to effective interception and annihilation by the PLA's fraternal corps. By the time they arrived under the walls of Kaifeng, it was already too late. On the contrary, they formed a posture of being beaten, creating a good opportunity for the PLA to continue to annihilate the Qu Shounian corps in the Sui County area of Eastern Henan.

The observer continued: The capture of Kaifeng most vividly demonstrated the political support of the people: on the one hand, due to the Kuomintang bandits' criminal dictatorial rule, especially the wanton bombing and looting of the Kaifeng urban area, disregarding the lives and property of millions of people, it aroused the people of Kaifeng's hatred for the Kuomintang bandits. On the other hand, the PLA's lenient policy, the policy of protecting national industry and commerce, the cultural and educational policy, the religious policy, and strict urban discipline were wholeheartedly and warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people of Kaifeng. Although the PLA only stayed in Kaifeng for a short four days, the PLA's political views and various democratic policies have taken root in the hearts of the people. Many university professors and thousands of young students participated in work and study in the liberated areas, and many people from all walks of life voluntarily cooperated with the PLA to jointly maintain social order. The PLA has brought unlimited courage to the suffering people of Kaifeng, and the PLA has become a symbol of future happiness in the hearts of the people of Kaifeng. The people of Kaifeng's clear political support is something the Kuomintang bandits can no longer reverse. The Kuomintang bandits not only cannot defeat the PLA militarily, but also cannot defeat the PLA politically. The Kuomintang bandits have alienated themselves from the people of Kaifeng, and from now on, Kaifeng will forever become a city of the people. When the PLA temporarily withdrew from Kaifeng in order to continue to annihilate the enemy's active forces, the people of Kaifeng were deeply convinced that the PLA would soon return in triumph. The great victory in Sui County, Eastern Henan, will undoubtedly give the people of Kaifeng the greatest excitement first. They will count the days, and the PLA's re-liberation of Kaifeng will not be too long.

The observer then pointed out: The PLA's swift launch of an offensive operation against the Kuomintang bandit Qu Shounian corps in the Sui County area of Eastern Henan immediately after the victory in Kaifeng was completely unexpected by the Kuomintang bandits. Chiang Kai-shek mistakenly estimated that the PLA had been wounded after the Kaifeng campaign and had to carry out rest and replenishment. He never expected that the PLA would have such a surprising and winning move. The observer stated: The PLA's continuous offensive in the Sui County area came suddenly and was fought fiercely, causing the Qu Shounian corps, which had entered the Sui County area, to have no time to shrink back, and could not wait for the "east-west pincer movement" rescue, and was quickly surrounded, divided, and annihilated. Huang Botao's corps was willing to disregard the encirclement of Yanzhou and rushed from the Jinpu Railway line at a long distance. Not only could it not save Qu's corps, but it also lost half of itself.

The observer praised the PLA's continuous fighting as the main reason for winning this victory in Eastern Henan, and an important symbol of the PLA's unprecedented strength after the new-style reorganization and training. All commanders and fighters of the PLA unanimously demonstrated a high degree of conscious spirit of fighting for the people in this campaign, overcoming sweltering heat, hunger, fatigue, and all difficulties, and fought continuously and tenaciously. Thanks to the strong leadership of the Communist Party and the guarantee of political work, and also making a large number of Kuomintang soldiers just liberated from Kaifeng immediately join the PLA in combat; a large number of weapons and ammunition newly captured from Kaifeng were immediately used to fight back against the enemy; one task after another was successfully completed. The PLA's tactical and technical level has also greatly improved, and the fraternal units closely coordinated in combat. The firepower was unprecedentedly fierce. From siege, field battles to blocking battles, they all demonstrated countless examples of the combination of bravery and resourcefulness. Especially in the battle to block the Kuomintang bandit's elite Fifth Army, the PLA used fewer troops to fight more, and stubbornly defended its position with strong counterattacks, repelling the enemy's fierce attacks with aircraft, tanks, and so-called "human bomb" tactics. In the blocking battle, they also captured guns and prisoners. For the past ten days, they have kept tens of thousands of Kuomintang bandits from the Fifth Division, the Seventieth Division, and the Eighty-third Division stagnant in the vicinity of Sui County, unable to move forward, watching as they were only twenty miles away from Qu's corps, and finally unable to save its fate of being annihilated. The PLA not only thoroughly and cleanly annihilated the three reorganized brigades of Qu's corps and nearly half of Huang Botao's corps, but also subjected every Kuomintang bandit invading our Sui County area to devastating blows.

According to Shen Chengnian, the captured commander of the Kuomintang bandit's 75th Division, they have completely failed in the first round of the "Eastern Henan Decisive Battle." This is something that no amount of deceptive propaganda by the Kuomintang bandits can cover up. If the so-called "Eastern Henan War has achieved a decisive victory" recently boasted by the Kuomintang bandits is indeed a little bit true, then may I ask where their corps commander Qu Shounian and division commander Shen Chengnian and all of his 75th Division, all of the New 21st Brigade, and a part of Huang Botao's corps have gone? Can you please ask him to come out and talk about the specific situation of the "victory"? Originally, the Kuomintang bandits' so-called "great victory" is nothing more than saying that some of their troops temporarily escaped the fate of being completely annihilated, and can Chiang Kai-shek, who is now in his twilight years, still not issue an extra "celebratory" edition for this?

The observer finally pointed out: The victories in Kaifeng and Eastern Henan have caused the Kuomintang bandits to lose a total of 100,000 men in one month (including the annihilation of the enemy by various fraternal corps in blocking actions). Therefore, it has caused extreme chaos and anxiety within the Kuomintang bandits' reactionary ruling camp, and will to a large extent cause the Kuomintang bandits' reactionary rule in the Central Plains to collapse. Especially the remaining local Kuomintang bandits in Henan, because Kaifeng cannot be secured, will lose their last bit of confidence. It is no wonder that Chiang Kai-shek himself had to fly to the skies over Eastern Henan again and again to personally direct; but it is precisely this personal direction that demonstrates the greatest incompetence, and it is destined that the Kuomintang bandits will inevitably suffer the fate of being completely annihilated. In order to try to rescue his failure, Chiang Kai-shek wantonly bombed the urban area of Kaifeng and the countryside with a large number of American-made aircraft, turning the beautiful ancient capital and the lives and property of millions of people into ashes. Chiang Kai-shek and his master, American imperialism, should bear full responsibility for this inhumane fascist bloody crime, and they will suffer even more severe punishment from the people.

　　华东军事观察家　评我军开封豫东之捷
    【新华社豫东前线十七日电】华东人民解放军军事观察家评论开封及豫东大捷。指出解放军攻克开封，歼敌三万九千人及在豫东睢＠地区歼灭蒋匪区寿年、黄伯韬、邱清泉三兵团各一部共五万余人，活捉兵团司令区寿年整七十五师师长沈澄年的伟大胜利，对于今后继续在中原大量歼灭敌人有生力量，改变中原战局及进一步巩固中原解放区的建设，将起重大作用。遭受惨痛打击的敌人，而对着解放军未来更加强大的攻势，势将继续以放弃某些点线，并用拆东补西，那里告急那里去兵的办法，来勉强支持。但在战略上将更加被动，兵力亦必更为不足，其企图集中一部分部队作战略防御下的战役进攻，以与我对中原进行拉锯争夺的可能也将逐渐减少，终必穷于应付而使中原战局将发生根本的变化。同时，由于敌被迫自华中与山东等战场抽调兵力增援中原的结果，也就更加便利于各该战场解放军顺利的进行进攻。观察家继分析解放军攻克开封的重大意义，不仅是军事上的、而且是在政治上的，特别是在政策上打了一个大胜仗。观察家称：作为蒋匪中原军事重镇和反动统治神经中枢的河南省会开封，是一个长期设防的城市，蒋贼在其猪仔国大上，曾亲自向河南伪国大代表保证不能丢失了的。可是正当蒋匪纠集其大量兵力于鲁西南吹嘘着所谓“机动作战”的时候，解放军突然兵临开封城下，并一举攻克之，这证明任何蒋匪紧固设防的城市都不是不可攻破的。而解放军的这种战略上的主动，就完全错乱了蒋匪的兵力部署，迫使其不得不仓惶自各地抽兵增援，除调动了几乎是全部中原蒋匪的机动兵力而外，连在苏中、苏北、淮南、山东的八十三师、七十二师、二十五师、六十三师也都拼凑来了；但都远在百里和数百里路以外，便遭到解放军各兄弟兵团有力的阻击与歼灭性打击，待其赶到开封城下，已经为时太晚了。相反，却摆成了一个挨打的态势，为解放军继续在豫东睢＠县地区歼灭区寿年兵团，创造了良好的战机。
    观察家继称：开封的攻克，最鲜明的显现了政治上人心的向背：一方面由于蒋匪罪恶的独裁统治，特别是对开封市区的滥肆轰炸，与纵火抢掠，置千万人民的生命财产于不顾，因而激起了开封人民对蒋匪的千仇万恨。另一方面则是解放军的宽大政策，保护民族工商业政策，文化教育政策，宗教政策与严明的城市纪律，受到开封广大人民衷心热烈的欢迎。解放军在开封虽只短短的停留了四天，但解放军的政治主张及各项民主政策已深入人心，许多大学教授及成千的青年学生参加解放区工作和学习，许多社会人士自动起来与解放军合作，共同维持社会秩序，解放军已为苦难的开封人民带来了无限斗争的勇气，解放军在开封人民的心目中，已成为未来的幸福的象征。开封人民在政治上这种明白的向背，是蒋匪再也无法挽回的了。蒋匪不仅在军事上打不过解放军，而且在政治上更打不过解放军，蒋匪已自绝于开封人民，从此开封将永远成为人民的城市。当解放军为着继续歼灭敌人有生力量而暂时撤离开封时，开封人民已深信解放军不久就会凯旋。豫东睢ｚｈī＠①大捷无疑的将首先给开封人民以最大的兴奋，他们会屈指计算，解放军之再度解放开封并不会为时过久的。
    观察家接着指出：解放军继开封大捷迅即在豫东睢＠地区又发起对蒋匪区寿年兵团的攻势作战，是完全出于蒋匪的意料以外的，蒋贼错误的估计，以为解放军经过开封战役后已经打伤了，必须进行休整补充，万万也料想不到解放军会有这么出奇制胜的一着棋。观察家称：解放军在睢＠地区的连续攻势来得突然，打得勇猛，使进到睢＠地区的区寿年兵团来不及收缩，也等不及“东西对进”的援救，便迅速被包围分割而歼灭了。黄伯韬兵团宁愿置兖州的被围于不顾，从津浦线上远程赶来，不但救不了区兵团，连自己也赔上了一半。
    观察家至此盛赞解放军的连续战斗乃是赢得此次豫东大捷的主要原因，是解放军经过新式整训后空前强大的重要标志。解放军全体指战员在此次战役中均一致表现了为人民而战的高度自觉精神，克服溽暑，饥饿、疲困和一切困难，连续顽强作战。由于共产党的坚强的领导和政治工作的保证，并使大批刚自开封解放的国民党军士兵立即加入解放军作战；大量甫山开封缴获的武器、弹药，立即又被用来打回敌人方面去，一个任务紧接着一个任务，均胜利的完成。解放军的战术技术水平也大为提高，各兄弟部队密切协同作战，炮火空前猛烈，从攻坚、野战到阻击战斗，均表现了无数英勇与机智结合的范例。特别是在阻击蒋匪精锐第五军的战斗中，解放军以少敌众，以强力的反击固守阵地，打退敌人飞机坦克和所谓“肉弹”战术猛烈的进攻。在阻击战斗中，同样缴枪捉俘虏，十天以来使蒋匪第五师、七十师、八十三师等数万之众，始终停滞于＠县近郊，未能前进一步，眼看着与区兵团相距不过二十余里，终于无法挽救其被歼的命运。解放军不仅彻底干净的歼灭了区兵团的三个整旅，和黄伯韬兵团的几乎近半的兵力，而且使进犯我睢＠地区的每一个蒋匪都遭到歼灭性的打击。
    据被俘的蒋匪整七十五师师长沈澄年承认在“豫东决战”的第一回合中，他们已完全失败，这是蒋匪任何欺骗宣传都无法掩饰的。如果蒋匪近来吹嘘的所谓“豫东大战已获决定性胜利”果然是有一点点真实性，那么请问他们的兵团司令区寿年和师长沈澄年及其所属的七十五师全部、新二十一旅全部和黄伯韬兵团的一部又到哪里去了呢？能不能请他出来说一说“胜利”的具体情形呢？原来蒋匪的所谓“伟大胜利”，不是别的，只是说他还有一些部队暂时逃脱了完全被歼灭的下场罢了，而这一点对于今天的风烛残年的蒋介石，难道还能不大出其“庆祝”的号外吗？
    观察家最后指出：开封和豫东大捷使蒋匪在一个月之内足足损失了十万之众（连各兄弟兵团阻击歼敌在内）。因此已引起蒋匪反动统治阵营内部极度的混乱与不安，在很大程度上将使蒋匪在中原的反动统治陷于土崩瓦解。尤以目前在河南尚残存的一些土著蒋匪，由于开封也无法确保，将丧失其最后的一点信心，这也就难怪蒋贼自己不得不惊慌万状的一再飞临豫东上空亲自指挥；但正是这种亲自指挥，才表现了最大的无能，才注定了蒋匪不可避免的要遭到全部被歼的命运。蒋贼为了企图援救其失败，曾以大批美制飞机向开封市区及乡村滥肆轰炸，使美丽的古都和千万人民的生命财产化成灰尽，对于这种灭绝人性的法西斯血腥罪行，蒋贼及其主子美国帝国主义应负完全责任，他们将遭受到人民更严重惩罚。
