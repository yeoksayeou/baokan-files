　　Strictly Investigate Counterfeit Currency
  　Chiang Kai-shek's Clique Conspires to Disrupt Finances, Shamelessly Manufacturing Fake Southern Hebei Currency
    [Taihang Telegraph] The Taihang Branch of the Southern Hebei Bank has received reports from various locations in the past month that Chiang Kai-shek's clique in Anyang and Tianjin-Beijing areas are now forging 100, 500, and 1000-yuan denominations of Southern Hebei currency in large quantities to infiltrate our region, steal our resources, and disrupt our financial trade. Recently, the enemy transported approximately 1 billion yuan of fake 1000-yuan Southern Hebei currency from Beiping to Baoding. On May 28th, a shop in Anyang discovered 10 million yuan in fake 1000-yuan Southern Hebei currency. Large quantities of counterfeit currency have been discovered in the Taihang Third and Fifth Sub-districts and the Taiyue area. In Jinzhuang Village, Huguan, the masses captured nine counterfeit currency peddlers within ten days, seizing 2.95 million yuan in fake currency and a large sheet of fake tobacco tax stamps. The local armed forces in Zhangnan, northern Henan, captured a counterfeit currency criminal – Li Jinxiu, the uncle of the stubborn puppet leader Wang Ziquan – and found over 100,000 yuan in fake currency. According to Li's confession, he was specifically responsible for selling fake currency in the Guangping, Feixiang, and Daming areas. He also stated that the stubborn bandit leaders Wang Ziquan and Liu Lexian had established six or seven counterfeit currency printing locations in the urban area of Anyang, issuing them in large quantities. Various types of counterfeit currency have been discovered, including the 1000-yuan red edition, the 500-yuan green edition, the single-numbered 500-yuan yellow background green edition, the large 500-yuan blue edition, the light pink edition, and six types of 200-yuan currency. Their method of promotion involves using armed force to coerce exchanges, utilizing border merchants, hooligans, spies, and ordinary women and children to sell the currency in our interior. They mix new and old currency, real and fake currency, and large and small denominations, or use large denomination fake currency to buy small items and exchange for real currency. Or, when buying something, they first give a fake note to see if you can recognize it; if you can't, they use a large amount of fake currency to purchase goods. The Taihang Branch of the Southern Hebei Bank has specifically instructed all localities to quickly organize a mass anti-counterfeit currency campaign, teach the masses to identify real and fake currency, and widely publicize the issue to the masses, urging everyone to pay attention, everyone to inspect, not to let go of a single counterfeit currency criminal, and not to let a single grain of food or a single thread of material fall into the hands of the enemy.
