Xinhua News Agency, North China, July 10th: According to various sources, Northeastern students stranded in Beiping and Tianjin are living inhumane lives. According to a Central News Agency Beiping dispatch on the 6th, more than 8,000 Northeastern students from the KMT-controlled areas, deceived by the Chiang government, have arrived in Beiping. In Tianjin, according to the Dagong Bao on the 17th of last month, there are "at least five or six hundred people." They have endured hardships to enter the interior for more than three months, but the Chiang government's promise to set up "Temporary Northeastern University" and "Temporary Northeastern Middle School" to accommodate them has not been fulfilled. A reporter from the Tianjin Yishi Bao reported on June 8th that the students who arrived in Tianjin, hungry and full of hope, first went to the Counseling Office (an agency established by the KMT Ministry of Education in name to "relieve" students) to register, but the Counseling Office said that the registration forms and relief funds were all used up, and told them to go to the Education Bureau to find a solution. So they went to the Education Bureau collectively, but neither the director nor the section chief was there. An employee said: "The Education Bureau is powerless. Go to the Counseling Office!" They were extremely saddened by this runaround. They waited in front of the Education Bureau with disappointment and anxiety. When the reporter left them at 6:00 p.m., they still had not eaten a grain of rice or a drop of water. Everyone's face was yellow and thin, and they spoke weakly. The situation for students in Beiping was even worse. The Dagong Bao said on the 17th of last month: "Taking Beiping as an example, some large houses are left idle, while many Northeastern students sleep under the eaves of guild halls and live in the holes of city walls."

In contrast to the cold treatment of the Chiang government, the students, teachers, and workers of major middle schools in Beiping and Tianjin are enthusiastically helping them with brotherly affection and are actively raising donations for them. In Tianjin, students from Nankai University, Beiyang University, Hebei Institute of Technology, and Women's Normal College had raised more than 164 million KMT currency (hereinafter the same) for them by June 6th, which was first distributed to more than 150 students with the most economic difficulties, and they continued to expand fundraising for them. Many school teachers also donated money to them despite their own difficult living conditions. Teachers and students of Tianjin Municipal Normal School cut back on food and donated money for them. Twenty-five workers from Beiyang University donated more than 4 million. Workers from Renli Factory donated more than 2 million. Students from Women's Normal College, Nankai Girls' High School, and other schools gave them blankets, clothes, shoes, socks, stationery, and newspapers, and prepared to tutor middle school students. In addition to launching fundraising campaigns, students from Hebei Institute of Technology also fasted for one meal to help Northeastern students, and sent the remaining 500 steamed buns through four representatives to the Education Bureau to distribute to the dozens of students staying there. Several representatives also spoke to the Northeastern students, advising them to "Don't be sad, don't be disappointed, show the appearance of young people." Students from the Institute of Physical Education, in addition to donating money and clothing, also sent representatives with letters to express their condolences and encourage them to "Don't be pessimistic because of this. On the contrary, stand up more bravely and strongly!" When batches of items saved or raised by the students of various schools were sent, "These precious friendships moved the wanderers to tears."

　　在平津的东北籍学生
    过着悲惨非人的生活
    平津学生教师工友节食捐款援助慰问
    【新华社华北十日电】据各方消息：流落平津的东北学生在过着非人的生活。受蒋政府欺骗抵达北平的东北蒋管区学生，据六日中央社北平电称已达八千余人，在天津的据上月十七日大公报说“至少也有五六百人”。他们千辛万苦进入关内三个多月，蒋政府所谓要筹办“东北临大”、“东北临中”收容他们的诺言一项也没有实现。六月八日天津益世报记者报导，抵达天津的学生饿着肚皮，满怀着希望，先去辅导处（按系蒋记教育部所设的挂名为“救济”学生的机关）登记，但辅导处说登记表和救济金都已用完了，叫他们到教育局去想办法。于是他们又集体前往教育局，找局长和科长都不在。某职员说：“教育局无能为力，你们到辅导处去吧！”戏弄得他们伤心之极。他们怀着失望而焦急的心情候在教育局门前，直到下午六时记者离开他们时，仍未进粒米滴水，每个人的脸色既黄且瘦，说话也是有气无力。到北平的学生情况更惨。上月十七日大公报说：“以北平为例，若干大房子让它空闲着，而许多东北学生却睡会馆檐下，住城墙洞中。”
    与蒋政府的冷酷对待相反的是平津各大中学学生，教师及工友，他们以兄弟般的情谊热烈的援助他们，纷纷为他们进行募捐。在天津方面，南开、北洋、冀工、女师学院四校学生，至六月六日已为他们募得一亿六千四百多万元蒋币（下同），先分配给经济最困难的一百五十多个同学，并继续为他们扩大募捐。许多学校的教师在生活困难中还捐款给他们。天津市立师范师生，为他们而节食捐款。北洋二十五位工友捐了四百多万。仁立工厂的工友们捐了二百多万。女师学院、南开女中等校学生纷纷以毯子、衣服、鞋袜、纸笔、书报等物品送给他们，并准备为中学生补习功课。河北工学院的学生为援助东北同学，除发动募捐外，且曾断食一餐，把剩下的五百个馒头，由四个代表送到教育局，分发给停留在那里的几十个学生，几个代表还向东北学生讲话，劝他们“不要伤心，不要失望，拿出青年人的样子来”。体专学生除捐赠款项衣物外，也派代表持函前往慰问鼓励他们“千万别因此消极悲观，相反的，要更勇敢、更坚强的站起来！”当各校同学把节约或募集得来的物品一批一批送来时，“这些珍贵的友情，使那些流浪者都感动得流下了眼泪”。（以上见六月五日至八日天津益世报及六月六日天津民国日报）
