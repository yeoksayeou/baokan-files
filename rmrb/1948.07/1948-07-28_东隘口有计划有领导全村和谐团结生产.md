　　[Taihang News] In Dongaikou, the third district of Zuoquan, party members and cadres lead the masses to precisely arrange their lives, absorb semi-able-bodied laborers to participate in weeding seedlings, complete agricultural work ahead of schedule, and also seize the remaining labor force to develop sideline occupations. Before weeding, the production committee made a precise calculation: the whole village has a total of 661.7 mu of small seedlings, with 60 male full laborers. Calculated at an average of 0.8 mu of weeding and millet pulling per work day, it will take half a month to complete. In order to complete the weeding ahead of schedule and free up time for supporting the front, the production committee asked village cadres to go to various mutual aid groups to carry out propaganda and mobilization, and organized 35 women and 42 children to participate in temporary mutual aid to start weeding. Some group members had the idea of emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture. When the group leader asked Liu Jinkui to weed, he said: "Weeding is important, but you can't stop the livestock and tie them to the trough without earning a living." He only wanted to go out and transport coal. The group leader said to him: "Our main way to get rich is through agriculture. If we don't weed the seedlings now and can't harvest grain, it won't work to just rely on sideline production to earn a few dollars. Farming has seasons, transportation doesn't. If you farm the land well, you can do sideline occupations at any time." Liu Jinkui thought it made sense, so he went to the field. This good point of his was praised, and his enthusiasm for production was increased. Other groups also had the idea of emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture. Village chief Zhang Tong and branch secretary Huangfu Ji convened a meeting to explain the importance of weeding, "Raising crops is the lifeblood. If you don't weed the seedlings, the land will be barren and you won't be able to harvest grain, which won't work no matter what." At the meeting, everyone discussed the method of combining weeding and sideline occupations, and decided to implement a collective coal carrying system of "no barren land, no idle donkeys," with good livestock handlers concentrating on driving the livestock. Huangfu Zhen could drive four animals alone. Huangfu Shan was 63 years old, and could only earn 7 points working in the fields, but driving livestock was his specialty. The group let him drive two mules and he could earn 10 points a day. He happily said: "Don't worry! I guarantee I will drive the livestock well and have fewer illnesses." Some livestock-raising households reflected that they didn't have fodder. Huangfu Zhen quickly bought back two dan of black beans, 500 jin of wheat bran, and more than 1,000 jin of dry grass for everyone, solving everyone's difficulties. Huangfu Mishan happily said: "When everyone works together, you don't have to worry too much. Just do what you can!" With the sideline occupation problem solved, everyone went to the fields with peace of mind, starting early and working late. The weeding, which was originally estimated to take half a month, was completed in seven days. During this period of production, many activists emerged. Cao Jinxiang, an old woman of 77, actively participated when she heard that the mutual aid group was mobilizing women to weed in the fields. Her group had a total of seven male and female members, and they pulled six mu of millet a day, earning her nine points. The old woman's actions influenced others, and Jia Yuying, who never went to the fields, also joined the weeding group. Zhao Guihua, a military family member, earned 93 points in the mutual aid group after weeding her own land. Branch Secretary Huangfu Ji, who was chronically ill, also led six children and pulled two mu of millet in one day.
    After weeding the first time, they used three days to pull the wheat and planted autumn seedlings. Now, the groups are applying top dressing to increase production. Huangfu Lanzhu said: "My seedlings are growing better this year than in previous years, but there is too little fertilizer. I only applied 15 loads per mu." He and his second child, Huangfu Qingheng, swept sheep manure with woolen bags on Wolingyan, sweeping eight bags a day, adding five dan of sheep manure per mu. Huo Yinchang led the whole group to grow milk pumpkins and corn, and has already grown more than 100 mu. (Compiled by Hao Shimin from the Joint Office)

　　东隘口有计划有领导全村和谐团结生产
    【太行讯】左权三区东隘口，党员干部领导群众精确的按排生活，吸收半辅劳力参加锄苗，提前完成农活，还抓紧剩余劳力开展了副业，锄苗以前，生产委员会就精确的计算了一下，全村小苗共六百六十一亩七，实有男全劳力六十个，每工以平均锄苗拔谷八分计，需半个月才能锄完。生产委员会为了提前完成锄苗，誊出支前时间，便让村干分头深入各互助组进行宣传动员，组织起三十五个妇女，四十二个儿童参加临时互助，开始锄苗。个别组员存在着重副轻农的思想，刘进奎在组长叫他锄苗时说：“锄苗是重要，但不能把牲口停停拴在槽上不去赚个活钱”，他光想出去＠煤赶脚。组长和他说：“咱们发家致富主要是靠农业，现在不锄出小苗，打不下粮食，光靠搞副业生产赚几个钱也不行。种地有节令，运输没节令，把地种好，副业啥时也能搞。”刘进奎听着很对，于是也上开地了。他这点好处受到了表扬，生产劲头提高了。其他组也先后发生重副业轻农业的思想，村长张通、支书皇甫＠即召开会议，说明锄苗重要，“养种是命根，锄不出苗来，荒了地，打不下粮食，怎么都不行。”在会上发动大家讨论了锄苗与副业结合的办法，决定实行“地不荒、驴不闲”的集体驮煤制，由赶牲口的好把式集中赶牲口。皇甫镇一个人能赶四头，皇甫善六十三岁了，到地受只能赚七分，赶牲口是把式，组里让他赶二条骡一天能赚到十分。他高兴的说：“你们放心吧！我保证把牲口赶好，少出病。”有些养牲口户反映没草料，皇甫镇很快的替大家购回黑豆二石，面麸五百斤，干草千余斤，解决了大家的困难，皇甫米山高兴的说：“组织起来大伙办，不用多费心，能办啥就办啦！”副业问题解决了，大家安心上地，起早搭黑，原来计算半个月才能完成的锄苗，七天时间就锄完了。在这段生产中，涌现出许多积极分子。曹金香老婆婆今年七十七岁，一听说互助组动员妇女上地锄苗，自己也积极的参加，她组男女组员共七人，一天拔谷六亩，她能赚到九分。老婆婆的行动影响了别人，永不上地的贾玉英也参加了拔苗组。军属赵桂花拔完了自己的，在互助组里还赚了九十三分。支书皇甫＠同志常年有病，也带领六个儿童，一天拔了二亩谷。
    锄完第一遍小苗，用三天时间拔完麦子，种了秋苗，现在各组正在增产上追肥。皇甫兰柱说：“我今年的苗比往年长的好，就是粪少，每亩才上了十五担。”他和他二小皇甫庆恒到卧羊岩用毛口袋扫羊粪，一天扫八口袋，每亩多增加了五担羊粪。霍银昌领导全组奶南瓜和玉茭，已经奶了一百多亩。（联合办公室郝世民整理）
