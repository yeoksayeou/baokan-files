　　【Beiyue News】The Yangquan Municipal Government has organized a textile training class to specifically train poor men and women from the city and villages, teaching them textile technology. The class used a loan of grain to purchase six cloth looms, twelve 14-yarn machines (machines that produce 14 yarns), four 72-yarn machines (machines that produce 72 yarns), and one wind bow. A total of forty-four trainees, all of whom are poor, are being trained. After several months of training, thirty-three people have learned basic techniques. In a very short period recently, they have produced 4,962 jin of yarn and 186 bolts of homespun cloth.
　　In order to quickly promote technology and expand production, in addition to sending technical instructors from the textile training class to provide technical guidance to various streets, 19,166 jin of millet were used to repair 15 cloth looms, five 74-yarn machines, twenty-six 14-yarn small machines, one towel machine, two wind bows, and a set of textile machine parts. These were distributed to various counties for promotion through the Beiyue Second Special District Textile Technology Promotion Agency.
