[Taihang News] The Huaxing Factory in Changzhi City has successfully trial-produced glycerin, machine oil, kerosene, and gasoline from agricultural products. The factory was originally a small soap factory organized by several technicians, including Shang Ruke and Ping Menglin, with a total capital of 2,275,000 yuan (冀钞, Ji currency) and ten workers. In addition to making soap, they carefully selected high-quality raw materials and used scientific methods. After half a month of painstaking research, they produced glycerin, machine oil, gasoline, and kerosene on June 19th. The raw materials are agricultural products, and the cost is very low. They supply the needs of industry and the vast rural areas, and sales are wide. After testing, the quality is very good. Customers reflected: "The kerosene is very clear, the lamp wick is very bright, there is no black smoke, and it can compare with American kerosene." Currently, one pot produces 100 jin per day, and there are plans to gradually expand to add five more pots and an oil press by the end of the year, which will further reduce costs. The government, to reward this kind of industrial creation, has issued loans to support and encourage its continued development.

　　长治华兴工厂试制煤油成功
    【太行讯】长治市华兴工厂以农产品试制甘油机器油及煤油、汽油，已获成功。该厂原来是尚如科、平孟林等几个技术工人组织的小型肥皂厂，集有资本二百二十七万五千元（冀钞），共有工人十人。除了制造肥皂外，并精选上等原料，用科学方法，经半月的苦心研究，在六月十九日制出甘油、机器油、汽油、煤油等四种产品。原料是农产物，成本甚低。供给工业与广大农村需用，销路很广。经过试验质量很好。顾客反映：“煤油汤很清，灯花很明亮，没黑烟，能比上美国煤油。”现在一口锅日产百斤，计划逐渐扩大，到年底增加五口锅和榨油机一架，当更能减低成本。政府为奖励此种工业创造，特发贷款扶植，鼓励其继续发展。
