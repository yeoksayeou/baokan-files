[Chahar News] When Tahe Village, Wanping First District, distributed agricultural loans, it fully promoted democracy, held various meetings for repeated study, mobilized the masses for household-by-household review, and provided specific assistance to borrowing households in formulating production plans, achieving good results and satisfying the masses. Before the distribution, village branch committees, Party member meetings, and village cadre meetings were held separately to discuss the distribution targets and methods. Many people revealed dependent thoughts, complaining that the agricultural loans were too small, and exhibited a "component-only" viewpoint. When discussing Zhang Fuquan and Zhang Fuxing, some people suggested, "They were originally landlords and rich peasants, and although they have difficulties, they should not be given loans." Some people raised different opinions: "Zhang Fuxing was indeed a landlord and rich peasant, but after the land reform, he has actively engaged in production and has done a good job in supporting corvee labor and standing guard. Now that he does have difficulties, we should help him solve them, or he will be a burden to our village." Others said: "The purpose of loans is to promote production. If they can produce well, they should be given loans." As a result, the latter opinion was adopted. The question of whether lazy man Du Bao should be given a loan caused heated debate. Finally, it was decided to lend to him in the spirit of transforming and educating him on the one hand, and solving his difficulties on the other. At the village cadre meeting, Production Committee member Fu Jingwen suggested that the amount of grain loans was not much, and he himself could forgo the loan. Everyone knew that he was the most impoverished household in the village and repeatedly persuaded and explained, but it was still decided to give him a loan. At these meetings, eighteen borrowing households were initially decided upon. Then, a mass meeting was held to review and decide on each household. Wang Chaohuan still had more than one shi of grain in storage, and he was not a very impoverished household, so everyone removed him from the list. Someone suggested adding Wang Yongqing and Wang Ji, and everyone approved. After the meeting, cadres summoned the grain-borrowing households to discuss production methods and immediately helped Cheng Jingchao, Zhang Fuxing, and Han Jufu formulate production plans. Other grain-borrowing households will also make plans one after another to make the most effective use of the grain loans. The masses have commented, "This time the grain loan is truly fair and reasonable, with no favoritism." "Although the grain loan is not much, it solves many problems." Everyone is very satisfied.

　　塔河村民主发放贷款
    解决各阶层生产困难
    【察哈尔讯】宛平一区塔河村发放农贷时，充分发扬民主，召开各种会议反复研究，发动群众逐户审查，并具体帮助借贷户订生产计划，效果良好，群众满意。在发放以前，分别召开村支部委员会、党员大会、村干部会，讨论发放的对象与办法，不少人暴露出嫌农贷太少的依赖思想和唯成份论的观点，讨论到张甫全和张甫兴时，有人提出：“他们原来是地主富农，虽有困难，也不应贷给他们。”有人提出不同意见：“张甫兴原来确系地富，但土改后他也积极搞生产，支差站岗也挺好，现在确是有困难，就应给他解决，要不也是咱村的累赘。”还有的说：“贷款为的是促进生产，他们能够好好生产，就该贷给他们。”结果后面的意见被通过。懒汉杜宝是否该贷款的问题引起热烈的争论，最后确定本着一面改造教育，一面解决困难的精神贷给他。在村干部会上，生产委员傅景文提出贷粮贷款数量不多，自己可以不贷。大家知道他是本村最困难的一户，一再劝说解释，还是决定要贷给他。在这些会上，初步决定了十八户借贷对象。接着召开群众会议，逐户审查决定。王朝焕还存着一石多粮食，他不是很困难户，大家把他从名单里减下来，有人提出添上王永庆和王继两户，大家都通过了。会后干部召集贷粮户讨论生产办法，当场先帮助程景朝、张甫兴、韩巨福三户作了生产计划，其他贷粮户也将陆续作出，以便最有效的使用贷粮。群众纷纷反映说：“这回贷粮可真公平合理，一点私情也没有。”“贷粮虽不多，解决的问题可不少。”大家都很满意。
