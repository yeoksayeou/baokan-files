　　Pingshan Relaxes Production Leadership, Drought Relief Work Falls into Drift
    [This newspaper dispatch] Our reporter's exclusive interview: Pingshan County, which suffered a poor harvest last year, has experienced a month without rain since a heavy rain in early June this year. The drought is gradually forming and becoming more serious. According to Yu Conglong, a 72-year-old man working in the Industry Department of the Pingshan County Government, who has lived such a long life and repaired canals for most of his life, he has never seen the Ye River run out of water. The ten canals along the river always maintain a full water supply. The situation has changed this year. The water level in the Heguangtan and Gongsuntan canals has dropped by two-thirds. Sixty-one hectares of land in the ten villages along the river are difficult to irrigate, and 36 hectares of paddy fields are even more threatened. The Hutuo River, which runs sixty miles across the county, still had one or two feet of water at its driest last year, but this year there is only residual water in some places. Before the water rose on the 6th and 7th of this month (due to rain in other counties), some rice seedlings in Zhuhe Village, Sixth District, which is adjacent to the river, had already died from drought. In Tianxing Village, Second District, more than 30 mu of land were left unplanted after the wheat harvest due to lack of water. Of the 132,200 mu of paddy fields in the county, about one-tenth are irrigated by wells. This year, the water level in the wells has plummeted, and watering has often been forced to stop. The masses are extremely anxious and at a loss.
    In order to understand the overall situation, the reporter recently visited County Magistrate Zhang and asked about the county's measures for drought resistance and famine preparation. According to County Magistrate Zhang, they initially underestimated the severity of the drought. It was not until he went to the Hutuo River to resolve water disputes and personally saw the severity of the drought that he issued instructions for an "emergency mobilization to resist drought and prepare for famine." He also sent special personnel to the Hutuo River and Ye River canals to help the masses adjust water volume, which was quite effective. In order to urgently save the 36 hectares of paddy fields in the Gongsuntan and Heguangtan basins, the county government's Industry Department and Production Promotion Society twice sent people to convene the canal affairs committee members of Yuanquan, Minsheng, Shimen, Xingsheng and other canals to discuss water volume adjustment. After mobilization and persuasion, the above canals agreed to release 20% of their water volume to the Gongshun and Heguang canals, and the 36 hectares of paddy fields were finally saved. He said that there are no specific measures for drought resistance in the dry land, which accounts for more than 72% of the county's cultivated land. He said that the main difficulty is the lack of personnel (at present, all county, district and work team cadres, except for a very small number of secretaries, assistants and other cadres who are left to handle wheat requisition and other matters, are concentrated in the county to engage in ideology and have been in meetings for more than a month, and are currently still in the leadership inspection stage), which has caused the entire drought resistance and production work to fall into a state of drift. The masses are very anxious and cannot get strong leadership. Many villages and townships have to ask the "Dragon King" for rain, and some are waiting for relief. County Magistrate Zhang said that he has proposed to the relevant responsible parties more than once to send cadres to the countryside to engage in production and drought resistance work, but there have been no results for half a month. Some cadres are sporadically dispatched to the countryside during the study, and the focus is only on summer requisition. The reporter also visited Comrade Zhang Shilin, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee. Comrade Zhang said that he had studied it a few days ago, issued an instruction, and planned to study this work specifically in a few days. The reporter also visited Comrade Hu Kaiming, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee. Comrade Hu said that he had mentioned it to the County Party Committee, but there was not much improvement. The reporter believes that facing such a serious drought, the Pingshan County Party Committee's initial lack of attention to drought resistance has caused some losses. Although some work was later done (such as adjusting water conservancy, issuing drought prevention and famine preparation instructions, etc.), there was a lack of strong leadership and organizational guarantees. The main reason is that some comrades in the County Party Committee have subjectively relaxed production leadership, believing that the masses will engage in production themselves. Therefore, under the circumstances that the drought is developing more and more, the masses are ideologically confused, and they universally demand leadership in drought resistance and famine preparation, they are still divorced from the masses' current biggest demand and concentrate cadres to hold meetings to engage in ideology. This is a practice divorced from the masses. If this continues, it will cause the disaster to spread further and cause greater difficulties in people's lives. It is recommended that the Pingshan County Party Committee and the government quickly organize all forces to lead the masses to vigorously resist drought and prepare for famine.

　　平山放松生产领导抗旱工作陷于自流
    【本报讯】总分社记者专访：去年曾是歉年的平山县，今年自六月初旬下过一次大雨后，一月无雨，旱象逐渐形成，日趋严重。据平山县政府实业科工作的一位七二老人于从龙谈他活了这么大岁数，修了多半辈子渠，从未见冶河缺过水，沿河十条渠总是经常保持饱满水。今年的情况变了。和公滩与公顺滩两渠现下水位降落三分之二，沿河十个村庄有六十一顷地已难灌溉，其中三十六顷稻田更受威胁。横贯县境六十里的滹沱河，去年最旱时仍有一、二尺水，今年最旱时有些地方已仅余碛水。本月六、七日水涨（其他县份得雨）前，挨着河的六区朱河村，有些稻苗已旱死。二区田兴村麦收后，因缺水未种的白地有三十多亩。全县十三万二千余亩水地中，约有十分之一是井浇地，今年井水水位暴降，浇地时常常被迫中止。群众异常焦急，束手无策。
    记者日前为了解全面情况，走访该县张县长，询问县上对于抗旱备荒的措施。据张县长谈：他们开始对旱情严重程度估计不足，直到日前他去滹沱河边解决水利纠纷，亲自看到旱象十分严重，方才发出“紧急动员起来抗旱备荒”的指示。并派专人至滹沱河、冶河各渠，帮助群众调剂水量，颇获成效。为急救公顺滩与和公滩流域三十六顷稻田，县府实业科、生产推进社曾两次派人召集源泉、民生、石门、兴胜等渠的渠务委员，商讨调剂水量。经过动员说服，以上几渠同意各让十分之二的水量给公顺、和公两渠，三十六顷稻田终得救活。他说：占全县可耕地面积百分之七十二还多的旱地如何抗旱，尚无具体措施。他说：主要的困难是没有人（现各区除留极少数秘书、助理员等干部处理麦征等事外，全体县区及工作团干部都集中在县里搞思想，开会已经月余，目前仍停留在检查领导阶段），致使整个抗旱生产工作陷于自流。群众很急焦又得不到有力的领导，不少村乡只好向“龙王”去求雨，有的人则等待救济。张县长说：他曾不止一次向有关负责方面提议：抽派干部下乡搞生产抗旱工作，至今半月尚无结果，在学习中零星抽派一些干部下乡，重点也只是为了夏征。记者又访问该县县委副书记张士林同志，张同志说：几天前研究过，发了个指示，准备过几天专门研究这个工作。记者又走访地委副书记胡开明同志，胡同志说：他曾向县委提过，但也没有多少改进。记者认为面临这么严重的旱灾，平山县委会开始对抗旱重视不足，已造成某些损失，后来虽然作了部分工作（如调剂水利、发出防旱备荒指示等），但缺乏强有力领导和组织保证。主要原因是县委会中某些同志，主观上放松了生产领导，认为群众自己会搞生产，因而在旱灾日益发展、群众思想迷惘、普遍要求领导抗旱备荒的情况下，仍然脱离群众当前最大要求，集中干部开会去搞思想，这是一种脱离群众的做法，长此下去，将使灾害更加蔓延，造成人民生活中更大的困难。建议平山县委和政府迅速组织一切力量领导群众大力抗旱备荒。
