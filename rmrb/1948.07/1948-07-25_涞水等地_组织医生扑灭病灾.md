Laishui and other places
Organize doctors to extinguish disease disasters
    [Chahar Electric] Laishui organized doctors to treat disease disasters. Since the beginning of spring this year, sporadic cases of children suffering from nosebleeds, smallpox, and measles have occurred in various districts of Laishui. By the second half of May, the situation had seriously developed in eleven villages in the first, fourth, third, fifth, and seventh districts. Statistics from ten villages showed that 630 people suffered from smallpox and chickenpox, and 296 people suffered from measles. In order to extinguish the disease disasters, the county leadership issued a call to organize doctors from various districts to rush to the villages for emergency treatment. As a result, only a little less than 3% of the 926 patients died, and the disease disasters have now been basically extinguished.
    [Another dispatch] In order to unite medical personnel, the Fourth District of Wanping specially convened a symposium of doctors from the entire district, which determined: (1) To restore the Medical Association, divided into four groups, to organize all the doctors in the district. (2) Doctors should elect representatives to participate in the People's Representative Conference and boldly put forward their opinions. (3) Put aside the past airs of doctors and be available whenever needed for consultations. (4) Use more folk remedies and less herbal medicine to reduce the expenses of the masses. (5) Conduct health education for the masses. After the meeting, all the doctors actively returned to their villages to treat the masses.
    [Another dispatch] In order to strengthen medical work and protect the health of the people, the Wanxian Medical Research Association opened the first medical training class on the 17th of last month. Twenty-eight trainees graduated from the school on the 3rd of this month. Five of them from the fifth and sixth districts have already rushed to the front lines with stretcher teams. The remaining trainees from various districts have also gone to the countryside for internships or are awaiting orders to support the front.
    [Another dispatch] Some villages in Yangyuan have discovered a rash disease. In the Shoushan Village of the First District, fourteen people were ill, and seven died within three days. After the government discovered this, it organized doctors to carry out treatment. The disease disaster has now been relatively alleviated.

  　组织医生扑灭病灾
    【察哈尔电】涞水组织医生救治病灾。今年开春以来，涞水各区即有个别村庄小孩发生流鼻血、天花、麻疹等病，至五月后半月，一、四、三、五、七区有十一个村严重发展。十个村统计，患天花、水痘的六百三十人，患麻疹的二百九十六人。县领导上为扑灭病灾，特号召组织各区医生赴各村急治。使九百二十六个病人只死亡百分之三弱，目前病灾已基本扑灭。
    【又讯】宛平四区为团结医务人材，特召开全区医生座谈会，确定：（一）恢复医联会，分四个小组，把全区所有医生都组织起来。（二）医生选代表参加人民代表会，有意见大胆提出。（三）放下过去医生的架子，有病随请随到。（四）多用偏方、少吃草药，减少群众开支。（五）对群众进行卫生教育。会后各医生都积极回村给群众治病。
    【又讯】完县为加强医务工作，保障人民健康，县医务研究会于上月十七日开办了第一期医训班。受训者二十八名，本月三日毕业出校后，五六区已有五人随担架队赶赴前线。其余各区学员也分头下乡实习或待命支前。
    【又讯】阳原有些村发现疹子病，一区兽山村就病了十四人，三天内死七人。政府发现后，组织医生进行治疗，现病灾已较减轻。
