　　Government Workers Forced to Do Corvée Labor, Changzi County Government Should Investigate the Truth
Editor:
    The government has long stipulated that civil servants participating in government work should not be assigned compulsory labor in villages. Comrade Zhang Guixing, a cook in our school, is from Nanxiaohe Village, Second District, Changzi County, Taiyue. The village asked him to contribute corvée labor grain. Our school has issued a certificate for him, but it was ineffective. This March, the Third Special District Office sent an official letter, but the Changzi County government still has not corrected this, resulting in him having to pay 120 jin of millet. On May 10th, this comrade took leave to go home. On the 15th, he wrote a letter saying: Although he requested a leave of absence for more than a month, the village did not let him return, but made him go to do corvée labor. Returning to the school after doing corvée labor will affect both work and the morale of other staff members. I think there is no difference in policy between Taihang and Taiyue. I hope the Changzi County government will investigate and reply, and quickly correct this deviation.

### 机关工作人员被迫支差长子县府应检查真相

专栏：询问与答复

　　机关工作人员被迫支差长子县府应检查真相编辑同志：
    政府早已规定参加机关工作的公务人员，在村不摊勤工。我校炊事员张贵兴同志是太岳长子县二区南小河村人，村上叫他摊勤工米，我校已给他去过证明，但不顶事。今年三月又让三专署去过公函，但长子县政府仍没有纠正这点，结果出小米一百二十斤。五月十号该同志请假回家，十五号他来信谈：请假一月多，村上不叫回来，让去支差，支差回来再来学校，这样既影响工作又影响其他工作人员情绪。我想太行和太岳在政策上是没有什么分别的，希望长子县政府检查答复，希很快纠正这种偏向。
