　　【Taiyue News】On the afternoon of June 20th, Tunliu's second, third, and fourth districts were struck by hail, causing significant damage to wheat and autumn crops. In Cuimeng Village, all 400 mu of wheat were destroyed, while Wangjiazhuang Village only had one-tenth of its wheat remaining. Many rice seedlings were also severely damaged. The democratic government immediately instructed cadres at all levels to lead the masses in rushing to plant late-season crops and to take real responsibility for solving the seed shortage. Cadres were dispatched specifically to help lead and inspect the work in each village.
