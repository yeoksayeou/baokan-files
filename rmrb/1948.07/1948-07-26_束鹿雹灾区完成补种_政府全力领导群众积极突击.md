[Jizhong Telegram] In the Shukou hail disaster area, with the full leadership of cadres at all levels of the Party and government organs and the active crash work of the masses, replanting has been completed. On June 5th, a hail disaster occurred in 17 villages including Nanzhi Qiu, completely destroying 8,534 mu of crops and partially destroying 26,942 mu of crops. Many of the men in this area are away doing business, and there are many livestock, but there is a lack of manpower, and there are many difficulties in planting, and people's morale is very low. In order to solve the difficulty of planting in the disaster area and quickly complete planting, the Prefectural Committee transferred 120 people and 85 livestock from various organs and groups at the district level to assist county and district cadres in assisting the masses in planting. They convened village cadres and veteran farmers for discussions to discuss planting methods, and instructed the village production committee to investigate and register, plan for livestock and seeds, organize manpower, and devote all efforts to replanting. Due to the leadership and problem-solving of the district and county cadres, the masses are now actively engaged in production. Geng Lao Ji, a production model from Nanzhi Qiu, took the lead in organizing with others to help each other in planting. Heng Qiu Village organized 22 mutual aid groups, including 162 households. On the 11th, they planted 400 mu in one day. On the 12th, all 193 households in the village participated in mutual aid to rush planting. Yangjia Zhuang Village, which lacked manpower and livestock, temporarily implemented a method of exchanging labor for labor and returning labor in the future to carry out planting. In order to regulate seeds, Yuhua and Hengxing stores and the Shukou Promotion Agency transported more than 7,400 jin of various seeds such as late corn, mobilized the masses to exchange them for wheat, or loaned them to the masses. After such a crash effort, more than 20,000 mu of replanting had been completed in the three days from the 11th to the 13th. By the 15th, the earliest planted seedlings had already emerged from the ground. The local farmers were very happy.

　　束鹿雹灾区完成补种
  　政府全力领导群众积极突击
    【冀中电】束鹿雹灾区，在党政机关各级干部全力领导与群众积极突击下，已完成再播种。六月五日，南智邱等十七个村发生雹灾，完全毁了的庄稼达八千五百三十四亩，半毁的庄稼二万六千九百四十二亩。这一带的男人多在外经商，牲口不少，但人力缺乏，播种有很多困难，人们情绪很低。地委为解决灾区播种困难，很快完成播种，便抽调分区级各机关团体一百二十人，牲口八十五头，协助该县县区干部到灾区协助群众播种，召开村干、老农座谈会，商量种地办法，并指示村生产委员会调查登记，筹划牲口种子，组织人力，全力补种。由于分区、县区干部的领导与解决困难，群众乃积极生产。南智邱生产模范耿老纪，首先和别人组织起来，领头互助耩种。恒邱村组织起来二十二个互助组，包括一百六十二户。十一日一天就耩了四百亩。十二日，全村一百九十三户都参加互助抢种。杨家庄村缺人力和没牲口的，以暂时实行工换工、日后还工的办法进行播种。为调剂种子，裕华、恒兴商店和束鹿推进社运来晚玉黍等各种种子七千四百余斤，发动群众用麦子换，或贷给群众。经过这样突击，十一日到十三日三天中，已完成二万余亩的再播种。到十五日，最先耩的小苗，已经出地皮了。当地农民非常欢喜。
