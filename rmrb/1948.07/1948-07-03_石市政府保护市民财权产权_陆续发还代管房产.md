　　Shijiazhuang Municipal Government Protects Citizens' Property Rights; Successively Returns Confiscated Properties
　　[Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Municipal Democratic Government has consistently implemented the policy of effectively protecting the property rights of citizens. After investigation, properties belonging to minor puppets or clerks of the enemy and puppets, or those who had to work under the enemy and puppet rule due to livelihood constraints, or those who, although working under the enemy and puppet rule, operated legitimate businesses and did not seize people's property by force, have been successively returned. Recently, three confiscated theaters and all the properties of Ge Jiantang, the former puppet district chief, were returned. Ge is from Hejia Village, Huolu County, and engaged in the coal business in Shijiazhuang. After the "July 7th Incident," he colluded with the Japanese and puppet regime to establish Liu Da Company. After the Japanese surrender, in the 34th year of the Republic of China, he served as the chief of the First District and a member of the参议员 under the Kuomintang, and was one of the major landlords in Shijiazhuang. Before and after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, Ge and others, fearing punishment, fled to Peiping and Tianjin one after another. Their abandoned properties were left unattended, and the municipal government temporarily took custody of all his properties. Later, his relative Zhang Zongyong saw the municipal government's announcement regarding property issues and understood the policies of the democratic government. He immediately applied to the government for assistance in reclaiming the properties. The government, considering that he was not a die-hard traitor but only a minor puppet of the enemy, decided to handle the matter leniently and approved the application. On the 14th of this month, 44 houses, the Shengguang Theater, and three plots of land belonging to Ge Jiantang were returned. The People's Theater originally belonged to the Xingshang Construction Group formed by merchants Zhu Yinzhi and others. The group built the Tongle Theater in the second year of the Republic of China and leased it to Li Wenbing in the 29th year, renaming it Yong'an Cinema. In the 30th year, Li subleased it to the Japanese Shiratsu Jo, renaming it North China Cinema. After the Japanese surrender, Yao Bingfu of the Kuomintang Central Committee forcibly seized it under the pretext of enemy property, renaming it Central Cinema. After several negotiations by the construction group, Yao admitted their property rights but still refused to return it. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, Zhu Yinzhi, unaware of the laws of the democratic government, did not dare to come forward to claim it, so the government took it under management. After the municipal government issued an announcement protecting citizens' property rights, Zhu, representing the construction group, applied to the government in early April for the return of the property. After investigation and confirmation, the government immediately approved the return. The China Cinema was also returned at the same time.

　　石市政府保护市民财权产权
    陆续发还代管房产
    【石家庄讯】石市民主政府一贯贯彻切实保护市民财权产权的政策，业经查明确系敌伪小爪牙小职员或只为生活所迫不得不在敌伪统治下工作，或虽在敌伪统治下工作，但其经营均系合法营业，并未依势强占人民财产等行为者，其财产均已陆续发还。近又发还代管之三座剧院及前伪区长葛鉴堂全部房产。葛系获鹿县贺家庄人，在石市经营煤，“七七”事变后，与日伪勾结开办柳大公司，日寇投降后，于民国三十四年任国民党第一区区长和参议员等职，为石市大房主之一。石庄解放前后，葛等畏罪先后逃往平津，所遗房产无人照管，市府将其全部房产暂行代管。后其亲属张宗咏见到市府有关财产问题的布告，了解了民主政府的政策，当即申请政府代为具领，政府因其并非死心踏地的汉奸，仅为敌伪小爪牙，决定从宽处理，已予批准，于本月十四日发还葛鉴堂房产四十四所，声光剧院一所及地皮三段。人民剧院原属商民朱吟芝等所组之兴商建筑团，该团于民国二年建成同乐戏院，二十九年出租给李文炳，改名永安影院，三十年由李转租给日本人白津让，改名为华北影院。日寇投降后，蒋党中部姚炳绂以敌产为借口强行接收，改名中央影院。经建筑团几次交涉，姚某虽承认其产权，但仍强占不还。石庄解放后，朱吟芝不明民主政府法令，未敢出面请领，政府乃代为管理，市府发出保护市民产权的布告后，朱即代表建筑团于四月初向政府申请发还该项产业，经调查确实，政府当即批准发还。同时发还者尚有中华电影院。
