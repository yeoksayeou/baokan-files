Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London on the 26th: The British Labour Party magazine "New Statesman and Nation" wrote: "Qualified non-communist Western observers who have lived in the Communist areas of North China for many years unanimously believe that the Chinese people are being governed honestly for almost the first time in history; land reform has greatly benefited the peasants. Although this regime is inevitably strict, it is efficient and truly progressive." When the magazine mentioned the victory of the People's Liberation Army, which "has firmly grasped Manchuria and controlled one-third of other places," it pointed out: "American money and weapons have not been able to turn unwilling-to-fight troops into victorious armies."

    赞扬我解放区
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据法新社伦敦廿六日讯：英国工党杂志“新政治家与民族”周刊著文称：“曾在华北共产党地区住过多年的有资格的非共产党的西方观察家一致认为：中国人几乎是在历史上第一次被廉洁地治理了；土地改革促使农民得到莫大的利益。这一政权虽然不可免地是严厉的，但却是有效率的而且是真正进步的。”该杂志于述及人民解放军“已结实的掌握了满洲，并已控制了其他地方的三分之一”的胜利时，指出：“美国的金钱与武器并未能使不愿作战的军队变为打胜仗的军队”。
