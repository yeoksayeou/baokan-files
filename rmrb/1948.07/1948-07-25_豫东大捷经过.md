　　Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, 22nd: Frontline reporters report the following account of the victory in the Eastern Henan Campaign: The day after the People's Liberation Army proactively withdrew from Kaifeng in search of battle opportunities—on the night of June 27th—it launched a large-scale attack on the District Shou Nian Corps, which was reinforcing Kaifeng from southwestern Shandong, with lightning speed along the Sui County-Qi County line. By dusk on the 28th, the corps headquarters and the entire 75th Division were surrounded in the Longwangdian, Changlangtun, Yuxiangpu, Hezhentun, Yangguai, Qiutun and other areas northwest of Sui County. The enemy's New 21st Brigade was surrounded in Lulunji and Chenxiaolou north of Sui County, and the enemy's entire 72nd Division was surrounded in and around Tiefo Temple (north of Sui County), completing the entire encirclement of the corps. The enemy panicked and dug fortifications, attempting to resist stubbornly. The all-out annihilation battle began on the 28th. By July 1st, the entire 6th Brigade of the 75th Division and the entire New 21st Brigade had been annihilated. On the evening of the 1st, the heroic People's Liberation Army offered the most brilliant gift for the birthday of the Chinese Communist Party—a joint assault on the District Shou Nian Corps headquarters, where the 75th Division headquarters was located, in Longwangdian. Amid the deafening roar of artillery, the PLA assault troops bravely broke through the enemy's barricades, trenches, walls, and fortifications, rushing into the enemy's positions, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, destroying the enemy's tanks and flamethrowers, and resolutely completing the task of crushing the enemy's multiple counterattacks. After eight hours of fierce fighting, the battle was resolved by dawn on the 2nd, and the entire District Shou Nian Corps headquarters and the 75th Division headquarters were annihilated, capturing over 5,000 officers and soldiers, including District Shou Nian and Shen Chengnian. On the night of the 3rd, the PLA again attacked the 16th Brigade of the 75th Division, which remained in Yuxiangpu and other places. By the 4th, all the enemies in that area were eliminated. By this point, excluding the 72nd Division, approximately 20,000 troops of the District Shou Nian Corps had been completely annihilated. The PLA had achieved a decisive victory in this campaign. On the afternoon of the 1st, the Nationalist army's eastern route reinforcements, the Huang Botao Corps' entire 25th Division and the 3rd Rapid Column, and the 2nd Traffic Police Corps arrived in the northeastern area of Sui County, only a dozen miles away from the besieged 71st Division at Tiefo Temple. The PLA, moving with great speed, surrounded the entire Huang Corps in Changqiudian (over 20 miles northeast of Sui County) and the surrounding villages from the evening of the 2nd to dawn on the 3rd, and launched an offensive against the area with thunderous force. By the 5th, four regiments, one company, and part of the Traffic Police Corps had been annihilated, with over 3,500 enemy troops captured.
    From the first day of this campaign, another powerful unit of the PLA was blocking the Nationalist army's western route reinforcements, the Qiu Qingquan Corps' entire 5th Army and the entire 83rd Division, in the Qi County area, killing and wounding over 8,000 enemy soldiers in ten days. By the afternoon of the 6th, when the PLA proactively withdrew from the battle, the enemy reinforcements were still blocked along the Xugang-Sumugang line east, west, and south of Qi County, over 40 miles away from Tiefo Temple, the besieged location of the enemy's entire 72nd Division.
    During this campaign, in addition to the aforementioned enemy reinforcements from the east and west, Chiang Kai-shek also transferred the 41st Division of the 47th Army and the 1st Cavalry Brigade of the Sun Zhen Corps from Zhengzhou to the east, and transferred the entire 18th Army, the entire 11th Division, the entire 3rd Division, the entire 28th Division, and the entire 20th Division of the Hu Lian Corps from southern Henan, crossing the Sha River via Shangcai and other places to reinforce the north. The enemy's eastern, western, and southern route reinforcements totaled over 270,000 troops, but all were subjected to annihilation and severe casualties by the PLA blocking forces. Although Chiang Kai-shek dispatched a large number of aircraft to bomb and strafe day and night, and personally flew over the eastern Shandong battlefield to supervise the battle, the result was a loss of over 50,000 troops within ten days. From the PLA's commencement of the offensive on Kaifeng on June 16th to the end of the Eastern Henan Campaign, in just half a month, approximately 90,000 Nationalist troops were annihilated, creating an unprecedented victory since the PLA entered the Central Plains.

　　豫东大捷经过
    【新华社豫东前线二十二日电】前线记者报导豫东大捷经过称：解放军为寻求战机主动撤出开封的次日——六月二十七日夜，即以迅雷不及掩耳的行动，在睢县祀县一线，向自鲁西南增援开封的区寿年兵团大举出击。二十八日黄昏，即将区兵团部与整七十五师分别包围于睢县西北龙王店、常郎屯、榆厢铺、何祯屯、杨拐、邱屯等地区，将敌新二十一旅包围于睢县北卤仑集、陈小楼，将敌整七十二师包围于铁佛寺（睢县北）及其周围地区，完成了对该兵团的全部大包围，敌人慌做一团，挖掘工事，企图顽抗。二十八日大歼灭战即宣告展开，至七月一日止，先后歼灭七十五师第六旅全部，及新二十一旅全部。一日晚英勇的人民解放军，给中国共产党的生日贡献了最精采的礼物——会攻敌区寿年兵团部，即七十五师师部所在地的龙王店。在震耳欲聋的大炮怒吼声中，解放军攻击部队奋勇突破敌人鹿砦、壕沟、围墙、工事，冲入敌人阵地，展开白刃肉搏，摧毁敌坦克、火焰喷射器的顽抗，坚决完成打垮敌人多次反冲锋，经八小时激战，至二日拂晓解决战斗，全部歼灭区寿年兵团司令部及整七十五师师部，生俘区寿年、沈澄年等以下官兵五千余人。三日夜，解放军又对残存在榆厢铺等地的七十五师十六旅进行攻击，四日将该地之敌全部解决，至此区寿年兵团所部除七十二师外，约二万人均被干净彻底消灭，解放军已取得这一战役中的决定性胜利。一日下午，蒋军东路援兵黄伯韬兵团之整二十五师、第三快速纵队，交通警察第二总队到达睢县东北地区，与被围铁佛寺之整七十一师相距只十余里。运动神速的解放军，乃于二日晚到三日拂晓，又将黄兵团全部包围于常邱店（睢县东北二十余里）及其附近各村，并以雷霆之势，进攻该地。至五日止，先后歼其四个团一个连及交警总队一部，共生俘敌三千五百余人。
    此次战役从开始第一天起，解放军另部强大部队就在祀县地区阻击蒋军西路援兵邱清泉兵团之整五军与整八十三师，十日内毙伤该敌八千余名。至六日下午，解放军主动撤出战斗时，援敌仍被阻于祀县东西及南面许岗苏木岗一线，距敌整七十二师被围攻地点铁佛寺尚有四十余里。
    在此次战役中，除上述蒋敌东西两路援兵外，蒋介石还从郑州抽调孙震兵团之四十七军第四十一师及骑一旅东援，自豫南抽调胡琏兵团之整十八军、整十一师、整三师、及整二十八师、整二十师等部经上蔡等地渡沙河北援。敌东、西、南各路援兵，共达二十七万余众，但均遭解放军阻击部队的歼灭与严重杀伤。蒋介石虽派大批飞机日夜轰炸扫射，并亲自乘机飞鲁东战场上空督战，结果十天内损兵折将达五万余人。自解放军六月十六日开始进攻开封至豫东战役结束，前后仅半个月，即共歼蒋军约九万人，造成解放军进入中原地区作战以来的空前最大胜利。
