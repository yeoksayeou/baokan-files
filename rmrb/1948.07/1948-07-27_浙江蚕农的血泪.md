　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st. According to an article "Speaking of the Tears of Silkworm Farmers" published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao in early last month: In the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area of Zhejiang, a famous silkworm production area, silkworm farmers are suffering from the exploitation of the Kuomintang authorities and local despots. Half of the income of farmers in this area depends on silkworm raising every year. This year, as the cocoon harvest just came on the market, the Chiang government's "National Economic Commission" has already lowered the price of cocoon collection to 20 million yuan per dan (note: this figure is based on Central News Agency reports), and stipulated that "the purchase price of green cocoons will not be changed during the purchase period." However, the cost of silkworm farmers, just for mulberry leaves, requires 45 million yuan for each dan of silkworm cocoons produced (calculated as 15 dan of mulberry leaves required per dan of silkworm cocoons, with each dan priced at 3 million yuan), not including labor costs. The officially set price is already less than half of the cost. Bureaucratic capital colludes with local despots to form cocoon firms, forcibly purchasing cocoons at a low price of 15 million to 18 million yuan by relying on their power. They also specially made large scales, with each 100 jin weighing 2 jin more than ordinary scales. When silkworm farmers are unwilling to sell, they are threatened with armed violence. The provincial Department of Field Grain is also stepping up the collection of field taxes while the people are facing a shortage of food, ordering them to pay with silkworm cocoons. Under layers of plunder, the silkworm cocoons of many farmers are all looted, and they immediately fall into poverty and hunger.

　　浙江蚕农的血泪
    【新华社华中二十一日电】据上月上旬沪大公报刊载“挥泪话蚕农”一文报导：著名蚕丝出产地的浙江杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）地区，蚕农正惨受国民党当局及地方土劣的剥夺。该地农民每年收入的一半系依靠养蚕，今年茧花刚刚上市，蒋政府“全国经济委员会”即已将收茧价格低压至每担二千万元（按：此数字系根据中央社报导），并规定“青茧收购期内不再更动”，而蚕农血本，仅桑叶一项每生产一担蚕茧即需付出四千五百万元（计每担蚕茧需桑叶十五担，每担价格为三百万元），人工劳力尚未计算在内。官定价格本已不及成本之半，官僚资本又与地方土劣勾结，合组茧行，以一千五百万至一千八百万的低价，仗势强行收购，并特制大秤，每百斤又较普通秤大出二斤，当蚕农不愿出售时，即以武装暴力相威胁。该省田粮处亦趁民间粮食青黄不接，加紧催收田赋，勒令以蚕茧抵偿，不少农民在层层掠夺下，蚕茧全被搜刮，而立即陷于贫困与饥饿中。
