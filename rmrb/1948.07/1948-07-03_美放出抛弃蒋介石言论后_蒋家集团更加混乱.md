Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. After the US New York Herald Tribune published an editorial calling for "replacing" Chiang Kai-shek as "leader," the Chiang Kai-shek clique was very flustered. Because the situation was urgent, Dong Xian Guang had to hold a press conference in Nanjing on the 24th, trying hard to argue that the New York Herald Tribune's claim that Chiang Kai-shek's "prestige has declined day by day" was a "misunderstanding." However, Dong Xian Guang failed to convince the American reporters, nor did he convince Chiang Kai-shek's own "officials." On the same day as Dong Xian Guang's speech, the Associated Press sent a message from Nanjing saying: "Despite Dong's argument, the vast majority of observers, including many Chinese officials, believe that the mass support for Chiang Kai-shek's government has been weakened by the unanimous attacks of its party members, especially members of the Legislative Yuan. Some officials describe this attack as a serious damage to the Kuomintang's unity during a critical period." According to American news agency reports: In the pseudo-Legislative Yuan meeting on the 14th of this month, Huang Yuren, a member of the Kuomintang's Fuxing faction, openly attacked Chiang Kai-shek for "one person, one family monopolizing" the Kuomintang government's military, foreign affairs, and politics, and shouted for Chiang to hand over "government power." Another Kuomintang legislator named Liu Butong attacked Chiang Kai-shek for having "turned the Kuomintang into a party controlled by dictatorship," claiming: "Kuomintang members are increasingly dissatisfied with the few people headed by Chiang Kai-shek who rule the Kuomintang." This shows that the Chiang family court is approaching the day of collapse under the powerful hammer blows of the People's Liberation Army. Its American masters have repeatedly released remarks about abandoning the Chiang Kai-shek clique, making the Chiang Kai-shek clique even more chaotic internally.

　　美放出抛弃蒋介石言论后
    蒋家集团更加混乱
    【新华社陕北三十日电】美国纽约先驱论坛报发表要“换”蒋介石这个“领导”的社论后，蒋介石集团内部甚为慌张。因为情势紧迫董显光乃不得不于廿四日在南京举行记者招待会，极力辩解纽约先驱论坛报所称蒋介石“威信已与日俱减”为一种“误解”。但董显光并未能说服美国记者，也未能说服蒋介石自己的“官员”。就在董显光谈话的当天，美联社从南京发出消息说：“尽管董有此论调，但绝大多数观察家包括许多中国官员在内都相信，蒋介石政府的群众支持已因其党员尤其是立法院中的党员的一致攻击而削弱，若干官员形容这种攻击为严重危机期间国民党统一的严重损毁”。按据美国通讯社消息：在本月十四日的伪立法院会议中，国民党复兴系分子黄宇人曾公开攻击蒋介石“一个人，一个家族垄断”了国民党政府的事军、外交、政治，高呼要蒋交出“政府权力”。另一叫刘不同的国民党立委则攻击蒋介石已把国民党“变为一个被独裁控制的党”，声称：“国民党员们已愈来愈不满意以蒋介石为首的统治国民党的少数人”。这表示蒋家朝廷在人民解放军的有力捶击之下，已接近树倒猢狲散的日子，其美国主子一再放出抛弃蒋介石集团的言论，使蒋介石集团内部更加混乱。
