  　No. 6
    To Comrades Correspondents in Various Regions:
    Recently, many areas have had thorough rains, and the masses are rushing to plant, weed, and replant. Please quickly report on the specific progress of these tasks. When writing, please pay attention to explaining the solutions to various specific problems: such as how to organize all manpower and animal power to carry out voluntary and mutually beneficial labor exchange and shock work; how the government is adjusting war mobilization and curbing waste to adapt to the current rush to plant and weed; many people lack buckwheat, bitter buckwheat, vegetable, late millet and other late autumn crop seeds, how the government and the promotion societies and cooperatives are purchasing, coordinating, and mobilizing the masses to help each other solve the problem. How governments at all levels are assigning cadres to lead this work and the specific achievements received are all important contents to be reported.
