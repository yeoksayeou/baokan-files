　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 6th: The Jianghan People's Liberation Army fiercely attacked the Kuomintang's 52nd Division in the Panjiaji and Longwangji areas west of Yingcheng on June 26th, killing and capturing over a thousand enemy soldiers. The results of the battle are still being verified.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 8th: Delayed news: Local armed forces in a certain sub-district of the Yu-Wan-Su region, in coordination with the Kaifeng campaign, swiftly inserted themselves into the area north of Lanfeng on the Longhai Railway on the night of June 16th. They encountered a portion of local troops fleeing from Kaifeng towards Lanfeng, Kaocheng, Caoxian, Dongming, and other places. After a brief engagement, the enemy fled in disarray to the west. Our army pursued them to the northern suburbs of Kaifeng, where the enemy scattered and fled. We captured over 200 enemy soldiers alive and seized seven light machine guns and over 140 rifles. We suffered no casualties.
