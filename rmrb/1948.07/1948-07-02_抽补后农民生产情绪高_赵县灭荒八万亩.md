　　After Land Redistribution and Replenishment, Farmers' Production Enthusiasm is High
    Zhao County Eliminates 80,000 Mu of Wasteland
    [Report from this newspaper] A reporter from the North China General Branch, based on a report from the Hebei-Central Hebei District Party Committee to the North China Central Bureau, reported on the situation of wasteland elimination in Zhao County, Hebei-Central Hebei, stating: This spring, Zhao County had a total of 97,363 mu of wasteland, of which 82,025 mu have now been eliminated. More than 15,000 mu of wasteland remain. The District Party Committee analyzed the reasons for the wasteland in the report as fourfold: First, years of destruction and looting by enemies and bandits have led to continuous escapes from rural areas, resulting in the abandonment of some land, which has not yet fully recovered after liberation. Second, disasters are a factor. During the severe drought in 1943, the village of Tingzhutou had 900 mu of wasteland. It only rained in June of last year, resulting in one-third of the land in Tangjiazhai village (a total of 20 qing) being abandoned. Third, there is a large amount of unregistered land in rural areas, causing unfair burdens. Some villages have insufficient and unreasonable adjustments in war support and substitute farming, leading to a decrease in livestock, which affects farming. Fourth, after the anti-traitor liquidation and land reform/review struggles, farmers obtained land from landlords, but because Yuanshi and Shijiazhuang were not liberated last year and were very close to the enemy, some farmers who obtained land dared not cultivate it. The report stated: After this year's land redistribution and replenishment movement, farmers obtained livestock, farm tools, and movable property. In addition, with the liberation of Shijiazhuang and Yuanshi, farmers' enthusiasm for production is higher than it has been in more than a decade. The number of livestock is also increasing, with one small area in the third district increasing livestock by 129 head. Government loans and support have also played a significant role. 1.7 billion yuan (border currency) out of 2.2 billion yuan in loans had already been issued by early June. Farmers in the western small area of the sixth district obtained loans and added more than 100 head of livestock. Repeatedly clarifying the policy of not infringing on middle peasants and advocating getting rich also played a certain role in the land reclamation effort. The report also mentioned that landlords and rich peasants have a lot of wasteland. In seven villages in the second small area of the second district, there are 1,237 mu of wasteland, of which 960 mu are owned by landlords and rich peasants. The solution adopted at the county cadre conference for this situation was: lend livestock to those who have difficulties in cultivating the land, urge them to work, and force them to plant.

    (Editor's note: Zhao County's achievements in eliminating wasteland are significant. However, how were the 80,000 mu of wasteland eliminated? The specific methods and complex organizational work have not been clearly explained. Another situation is worth noting, that is, according to the statistics of the second small area of the second district, 77 percent of the wasteland is owned by landlords and rich peasants. It is not known whether this situation can represent the general situation. Is this because landlords and rich peasants were allocated land but they are unwilling to plant, or because they were only allocated bad land? Or are there other reasons? Can the method of simply forcing planting solve the problem? Can it be guaranteed that the land will not be abandoned after planting? It is hoped that the responsible comrades in Zhao County can examine and report.)

### 抽补后农民生产情绪高　赵县灭荒八万亩

　　抽补后农民生产情绪高
    赵县灭荒八万亩
    【本报讯】华北总分社记者依据冀中区党委给华北中央局的报告，报导冀中赵县消灭荒地的情况称：赵县今春共有荒地九万七千三百六十三亩，现已消灭八万二千零廿五亩。未消灭荒地尚有一万五千余亩。区党委在报告中分析荒地的原因有四：第一是历年来敌人、土匪破坏、抢掠，农村中不断有逃亡户外出，使得某些土地荒了，解放后尚未完全恢复。第二是灾荒原因。民国卅二年大旱灾，亭竹头一村，荒地达九百亩。去年六月才下雨，唐家寨一村因而荒地三分之一（共廿顷）。第三、农村中有大量黑地，造成负担不公，有些村庄战勤代耕等调剂不够合理，牲口因而减少，影响了种地。第四、反奸清算与土改、复查斗争后，农民从地主手中取得了土地，但因元氏石门去年尚未解放，距敌近在咫尺，有些得地农民不敢耕种。报告中称：经过今年的抽补运动，农民获得了牲口、农具、浮财，加以石门、元氏解放，农民生产情绪之高为十几年来所未有。牲口数目亦在添加中，三区一个小区增加牲口一百廿九头。政府贷款扶植，也起了不小的作用，二十二亿（边币、下同）贷款在六月初已贷下十七亿，六区西小区农民获得贷款，增添牲口一百多头。抽补中反复说明不侵犯中农政策并提倡发家致富，亦起了一定的作用。报告中还说到，地主富农的荒地很多，二区二小区七个村荒地一千二百三十七亩，其中地主富农荒地即占九百六十亩，县的干部大会上对于这种情况所采取的办法是：有困难的借给牲口耕地，督促劳动，强制他们种上。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （编者按：赵县消灭荒地的成绩是很大的，但八万亩荒地如何消灭的？具体办法及复杂的组织工作都未交待明白，还有一个情况是值得注意的，即依据二区二小区的统计，荒地中有百分之七十七是地主富农的，这种情况不知是否能代表一般情况。这是因为给地主富农分了地他不愿种，还是因为只分了坏田？还是有其他原因？仅采取强制下种的办法是否能解决问题？是否能保证下种之后不再荒了？希望赵县负责同志能够检查报导。）
