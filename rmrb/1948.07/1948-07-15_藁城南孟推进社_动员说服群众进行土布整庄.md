　　Nanzhang Promotion Society in Wucheng
    Mobilizes and Persuades the Masses to Carry Out Soil Cloth Rectification
    [This News] In the vast area north of the Hutuo River in Wucheng County, there is a traditional base for weaving. However, the quality of cloth produced varies. Some people are accustomed to weaving bad cloth, known as "top peeling and bottom ring" (bad overlaps, good front), selling it to deceive people. Users often go to many markets without buying good cloth, wasting a lot of work back and forth. Weavers also feel that it is difficult to sell finished products. According to the needs of the masses, the Nanzhang Branch of the County Promotion Society decided to use Bird Brand and Tiger Brand as standards to carry out rectification, and was responsible for selling finished products. At the beginning, they publicized the benefits of rectification in the market, explained the standard size and weight, and the society bought the qualified cloths at a higher price. Seeing the benefits, weavers gradually increased the number of people who changed their cloths, and users would not be fooled. The society can collect more than 8,600 pieces of cloth per market. The local habit is to weave more water-line cloth, which must be dried before it can be branded. Bundling and weighing take a lot of time and are prone to mildew. Therefore, experiments were carried out to change the collection of dry-line cloth. After two markets of brewing, the masses were still afraid of being hurt. The society appropriately increased the price of dry cloth, and for those who handed in wet cloth, they were gently persuaded to dry it before handing it in. For dry cloth that was slightly wet, it was accepted and dried by the society itself. While collecting cloth, they publicized it at the same time, and the rectification work has been remarkable in two months. The old habit of weaving bad cloth for decades has gradually changed. The Promotion Society listened to the opinions of the masses and set up stalls in Zhao Village, Nandong, and Xiaoguozhuang to collect cloth, which further reduced the round-trip journey for the masses and was well received. They all said, "In this way, you can sell cloth early and late, which saves more work than going to the market." In the past six months, the society has collected more than 200,000 pieces of soil cloth, and the masses have benefited more than 450,000,000 yuan (border currency). (Reporters Huai Yu, Yao Fu)
    (Soil Cloth Rectification - Many counties in Beiyue and Central Hebei take weaving soil cloth as the main household sideline. However, the length and width of the cloth woven by each household vary, the quality varies greatly, and the prices are different. It is difficult to establish a fixed reputation in the market, which affects sales. Rectification is to stipulate a certain quality and price standard to achieve honesty and integrity and facilitate export.)

　　藁城南孟推进社
    动员说服群众进行土布整庄
    【本报讯】藁城县滹沱河北广大地区，素有纺织基矗但产布好坏不一，有些人惯织坏布，名为“上扒下环”（重叠处坏，正面好），售卖骗人。用户常常赶许多集买不到好布，往返费工很多。织户也感到成品推销困难。县推进社南孟一分社根据群众需要，决定以鸟牌、虎牌两种为标准，进行整庄，负责推销成品。开始先在集市宣传整庄的好处，讲明标准尺寸重量，合格者布价提高一些由社收买。织户看到有利，改庄者逐渐增加，用户也不会上当了。该社每集可收布八千六百余匹。当地习惯多织水线布，社里收了，必须晒干后才能打牌。打捆、过秤，费时很多，且易霉烂，于是进行改收干线布的试验。经过两集酝酿，群众仍怕被伤，该社即适当提高干布价格，对于交湿布户，婉言劝解使其晒干了再交，对于干布稍湿的便收下自晒。一面收布一面宣传，两月工夫整庄工作显著。几十年来织坏布的旧习气逐渐改变了。推进社听取群众意见，又在赵庄、南董、小郭庄等三处设摊收布，更减少了群众往返路程，反映很好，都说：“这样一早一晚就可卖布，比赶集省工。”半年来该社共收土布二十余万匹，约计群众得利四十五万万元（边币）以上。（记者槐玉、药夫）
    （土布整庄——北岳、冀中不少县份，以织土布为家庭主要副业。但各户织出的布，长宽尺寸不一，好坏悬殊，价格不等，很难在市场树立固定威信，影响了销路。整庄是规定一定的质量及价格标准，作到童叟无欺，便于外销。）
