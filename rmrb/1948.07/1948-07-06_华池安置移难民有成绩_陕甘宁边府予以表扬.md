Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th. Huachi County (newly established county in the Yuelezhen area north of Qingyang) in the Longdong Sub-region of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has achieved remarkable results in resettling migrants and refugees, and has been commended by the Border Region Government. From last winter to May of this year, in just over half a year, the county resettled 892 migrant and refugee households, totaling 3,209 people. It has successively provided disaster-stricken refugees with 145 *shi* of grain for sustenance, 11 *shi* of seeds, 14,685 *mu* of land, and 48 head of cattle. In addition, it distributed 100 *shi* of relief grain, 240 million yuan in agricultural loans, and over 80 pieces of farm tools and cooking utensils. Among them, 834 migrant households (accounting for more than 96% of the disaster victims migrating to the county) have transitioned to production and are in high spirits. According to statistics from four townships in Baima District, migrant refugees have reclaimed a total of over 1,100 *mu* of wasteland. The reasons for the county's success in resettling migrants and refugees are, first of all, that responsible cadres at all levels personally took action. For example, Bai Wanjin, the district chief of Rouyuan District, and Cui Shengyun, the township chief of the second township of Baima District, and Cui Hongshan, the village chief, personally helped 25 migrant and refugee households with their own farming, cooperative planting, etc., to enable them to participate in production. Pan Junhui, the secretary of the Yuele District Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others also personally went to various villages to find suitable jobs for the migrants and refugees. Secondly, cadres took the lead in helping to solve the difficulties of migrants and refugees, conducting extensive propaganda, and organizing mass mutual assistance. Yang Maoxing, the township chief of the first township of Rouyuan District, has helped refugees with a total of 2 *shi* and 2 *dou* of grain since last winter. Cui Shengyun, the township chief of the second township of Baima District, voluntarily provided 1 *shi* and 5 *dou*, and Cui Hongshan, the village chief, provided 1 *shi* and 2 *dou*. Influenced by the friendly spirit of cadres at all levels, the masses also actively helped. Li Changsheng, a farmer in the third township of Rouyuan, voluntarily donated 1 *shi* and 3 *dou* of grain to help Wang Zhangao and other four migrant households settle down. Cadres also held meetings of old residents and migrant refugees in the countryside, widely publicizing the suffering caused to the people by natural disasters and the principle that "farmers all over the world are one family," which greatly strengthened the unity and mutual assistance among the working people. The county government also distributed the 240 million yuan in agricultural loans allocated by the special commissioner in a timely manner, and extracted 2.85 million yuan of agricultural loans from the Wentai, Yuele, and Rouyuan districts to establish eight blacksmith shops to manufacture farm tools, directly helping migrants and refugees solve the difficulties of farm tools.

In the letter of commendation from Lin Boqu, Yang Mingxuan, and Liu Jingfan, the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Border Region Government, to Zhang Jiantang, the county magistrate of the county, it said: "Your county has achieved success in resettling migrants and refugees. The reason is that you have jumped out of the circle of empty talk (but indeed have not jumped out in some other areas) and have done the work in a down-to-earth and responsible manner. This responsible spirit of serving the people should be maintained and is worth promoting. It is hoped that you will continue to work hard and do all your work with the same spirit."

However, there are still areas for improvement in the county's resettlement of migrants and refugees, such as the failure of some districts (such as Wentai and Yuele districts) to distribute agricultural loans in a timely manner or to assist immigrants in purchasing essential production materials with agricultural loans; and in some places, there is still a phenomenon of excessive adherence to procedures in resettling migrants and refugees.

　　华池安置移难民有成绩
    陕甘宁边府予以表扬
    【新华社西北四日电】陕甘宁陇东分区华池县（庆阳以北悦乐镇地区新设县）安置移民难民工作，成绩卓著，获得边府之表扬。该县从去冬至今年五月半年多内，安置移难民八百九十二户，共三千二百零九人；先后共给灾难民调剂口粮一百四十五石，种子十一石，土地一万四千六百八十五亩，耕牛四十八头；此外并发放救济粮一百石，农贷二万万四千万元及农具、炊具八十余件。其中八百卅四户移民（占移往该县灾民户百分之九十六强）已转入生产，情绪很高。据白马区四个乡的统计，移民难民已开荒共一千一百余亩。该县安置移难民工作获得成绩之原因，首先是各级负责干部亲自动手。如柔远区区长白万金，白马区二乡乡长崔生云，该乡村长崔红山等人，亲自帮助廿五户移民难民自耕、伙种等，使他们参加生产。悦乐区中共区委书记潘均会等，也亲到各村为移难民找适当工作。其次是干部带头，帮助解决移民难民困难，进行广泛宣传与组织群众互助。柔远区一乡乡长杨茂兴，自去年冬至今共帮助难民粮食二石二斗。白马区二乡乡长崔生云自动救助一石五斗，该乡村长崔红山拿出了一石二斗。群众受各级干部此种友爱精神影响，也纷纷踊跃帮助。柔远三乡农民李长胜即自动捐粮一石三斗，帮助移民王占皋等四户安家。干部并在农村召开老户与移民难民会议，广泛宣传胡祸天灾给人民造成的痛苦和“天下农民是一家”的道理，大大加强了劳动人民间的团结互助。县府发放专署拨予之两万万四千万元农贷也很及时，并在温台、悦乐、柔远三区抽出农贷二百八十五万元，设铁匠炉八处制造农具，直接帮移民难民解决农具困难。
    在边府正副主席林伯渠、杨明轩、刘景范给该县县长张建堂的表扬信中说：你县在安置移难民方面是有成绩。原因是由于你们已经跳出了说空话的圈子（但确实在其他好些地区未曾跳出），踏实负责的做了工作。这种为人民服务的负责精神，是应该保持并值得发扬的。尚望继续努力，用同一精神做好一切工作”。
    但该县安置移难民工作尚有待改进之处，如有些区（如温台、悦乐两区）农贷尚未能及时发放或未以农贷协助移民购进生产必需品；有的地方安置移难民尚有过分拘泥手续的现象。
