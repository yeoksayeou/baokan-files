Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. The bloody crimes of traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who used American-supplied bombers to cruelly massacre peaceful residents of Kaifeng, have aroused unanimous righteous indignation among teachers and students of universities in Beiping. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 29th: "Professors from universities in Beiping have initiated a movement against bombing cities in the civil war." One hundred and twenty-two professors from Tsinghua University and other universities have issued a protest declaration for this purpose. Robert Winter, an American professor at the university, also signed the declaration. At the same time, students from nine universities in Beiping have sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek opposing the use of aircraft to bomb cities, and have issued an open letter calling on the people of the whole country to support their just demands. These nine universities include students from Fu Jen Catholic University, which is subject to strict controls.

According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 28th, citing the Xinmin Daily News: Students from Kaifeng in Nanjing accused the Chiang government of massacring the people of Kaifeng. They pointed out that the result of Chiang's planes constantly bombing the city after the People's Liberation Army occupied the city has caused "60,000 to 70,000" casualties among peaceful residents. Among the seven hundred students of the Kaifeng Women's Normal School alone, four hundred were killed by American-made Chiang planes.
