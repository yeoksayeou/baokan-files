　　Jinnan Administrative Office Calls for Crash Planting, Weeding, and Flood Prevention
　　[Another Telegram] The Jinnan Administrative Office issued an urgent directive on the 22nd, calling on cadres at all levels to seize the opportunity and actively lead the masses in crash planting, replanting, crash weeding, and flood prevention. (1) Conscientiously check barren land, uncultivated land, and fields where early seedlings have been killed by drought; mobilize the masses to rush to plant late seedlings, and replant where seedlings are insufficient. Call on the masses to make full use of village edges, field corners, and small plots of wasteland to grow large quantities of vegetables. State-owned stores and cooperatives should appropriately adjust vegetable seed supplies to ensure that the masses plant all cultivatable land. (2) Mobilize the masses to seize the time to weed late seedlings to avoid weed growth caused by continuous rain. (3) Call on the masses to retain more wheat fields and deepen the soil of the retained wheat fields, striving to plow three times, in preparation for planting large amounts of wheat after autumn to increase wheat harvest; mobilize the masses to cut large amounts of grass for green manure to fertilize the land and increase yields. (4) Intensify flood prevention and repair work; promptly block any breaches that have already occurred, and reinforce dangerous areas. The river committees of each county should quickly organize the masses to guard the dikes to avoid more serious flooding.
