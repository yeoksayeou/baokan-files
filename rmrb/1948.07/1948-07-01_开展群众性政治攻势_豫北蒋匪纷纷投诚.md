[Taihang News] Besieged in isolated strongholds in northern Henan such as Anyang and Jiaozuo, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops and local bandits have surrendered to us one after another in recent months under the impact of our mass political offensives, bringing with them a considerable number of machine guns, rifles, and other weapons. They have been welcomed by our democratic government. During this period of political offensive, our military and civilians in various areas have implemented the correct policy of our Party and our army in winning over the broad masses of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet soldiers and lower-ranking officers, publicizing the lenient policy that "those who return will not only not be killed, but those whose homes are in the liberated areas will also be given a share of land, and those whose homes are not in the liberated areas will be given travel expenses if they wish to return, and those who bring weapons will be rewarded." A soldier of Chiang’s 40th Division, whose home was in a village in the Third District of Ye County, did not initially believe in our policy. After secretly returning to his village to inquire, he was happy to find that it was indeed the case, and he ran back to his original unit and colluded with several other soldiers to return together. During the wheat protection campaign, the soldiers within the Jiangjun stronghold, which is part of Bo'ai, understood our policy and spread the word: "The Communist Party's policy is even better." Within seven days, nine local Chiang Kai-shek soldiers returned. A company commander of the Chiang army, whose home was in Chu Wang Village, Zhangnan, also defected to our side with more than eight hundred rounds of ammunition. In terms of methods for disintegrating the enemy army, various localities have created experience in launching mass political offensives, namely, armed penetration into the heart of Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn areas to carry out propaganda and launch mass "calling for husbands and sons" movements. A certain unit and the Zhangnan, Ye County, and Tangyin counties of the Fifth Military District used the above method to launch a political offensive against Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops in the isolated city of Anyang. From April 8th to 25th, in half a month, they disintegrated and brought back one hundred and eighty-three Chiang Kai-shek stubborn soldiers. In a village in the Second District of Ye County, forty-one Chiang Kai-shek stubborn soldiers were called back to their hometowns. The father of a puppet soldier in a village in the Fourth District personally went to Anyang City to call his son back after hearing about the Land Law. His son then won over four puppet soldiers to return together. Huangtun Village in Bo'ai warmly settled a Chiang Kai-shek soldier ××× who returned and allocated two acres of wheat land to him. He excitedly said: "I have finally seen the light of day." In addition, large numbers of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army soldiers deserted. In the Liu Shoushan unit of the puppet Anyang Security Regiment, which had more than three hundred and forty people, more than one hundred took the opportunity to escape during our army's victorious strikes in the first half of June. The broad masses of soldiers under the strict surveillance and control of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are all looking forward to the People's Liberation Army liberating them soon. Chiang Kai-shek's puppet soldiers in ×× city secretly discussed: "If the Liberation Army comes, which turtle won't surrender!"

    【太行讯】困守豫北安阳、焦作等孤立据点的蒋伪土顽，数月来在我群众性的政治进攻下，纷纷向我投诚，并带来不少机枪、步枪等武器，受到我民主政府的欢迎，这一段政攻中，我各地军民都执行了我党我军争取蒋伪广大士兵及下级军官的正确政策，宣传了“归来者不但不杀，家乡在解放区的，还分给一份土地，家不在解放区的，愿回者发给路费，携械归来者并给予奖励”等宽大政策。家在我邺县三区某村的蒋四十师一士兵，开头对我政策不大相信，经过秘密回村打探，如道果真如此，高兴的跑回原部，又串通了几个士兵，集体归来。护麦战中，博爱属将军据点内的士兵了解了我们的政策，纷纷传说：“共产党的政策更好了。”七天内即有九个土蒋士兵归来。家在我漳南楚旺庄的蒋军某连长，亦携带八百余粒子弹投奔我方。在争取瓦解敌军的方式上，各地创造了开展群众性政治进攻的经验，即是武装深入蒋顽心脏区，展开宣传，发动群众性的“叫夫索子”运动。某部与五分区漳南、邺县、汤阴等县，即是用上述办法对安阳孤城蒋伪展开政治攻势，从四月八日到二十五日半月中，即瓦解回一百八十三名蒋顽土兵。邺县二区某村就有四十一个蒋顽士兵被叫回乡。四区某村一个伪军的父亲听了土地法后，亲至安阳城叫他儿子回来。他儿子又争取了四个伪军一块归来。博爱黄屯村对归来的蒋军士兵×××热情安置，并分给二亩麦地。他兴奋的说：“我算是见到青天啦。”另外，蒋顽匪军士兵大批逃亡。伪安阳保安团刘寿山部，三百四十余人，六月上半月在我军胜利打击下，乘机逃跑者百余人。在蒋匪严密监视看管下的广大士兵，都盼着人民解放军早日解放他们。××城蒋伪士兵暗暗谈论：“要是解放军打来，那个鳖才不投降哩！”
