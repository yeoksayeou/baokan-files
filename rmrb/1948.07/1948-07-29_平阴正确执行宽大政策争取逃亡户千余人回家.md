(Jilu Yu News) The Pingyin recovered area has correctly implemented a lenient policy and carried out a political offensive, attracting 1,873 fugitive households to return home, accounting for one-half of the total number of fugitives. The returnees also brought back 119 rifles and 26 pistols.
    (Taihang Telegraph) Since July, the democratic governments and local armed forces of various counties in northern Henan have launched political offensives against the isolated strongholds of the enemy in Xiuwu, Jiaozuo, and other places. Local bullies and soldiers have surrendered to us one after another, and fleeing masses have returned home in an endless stream. After the political offensive meeting in Xiuwu on June 26, a political offensive blitz week was launched, during which 26 die-hard soldiers were won over to surrender to us within seven days. Under the influence of our military victories and political offensives, the Chiang Kai-shek clique was in chaos and unease, filled with pessimistic and wavering sentiments. Many villages in the Chiang-occupied areas that were forced to organize suicide squads were automatically disbanded under the influence of our political offensives. Fugitive households returned one after another. According to statistics from 13 villages in 4 districts, 116 people returned within 7 days, bringing back 23 head of livestock. The returning fugitive households were given relief and resettlement by the government, and the villagers helped by lending food and distributing land. From July 2nd to 5th, the third district of Jiaozuo won over 9 people, including the puppet self-defense corps. Four women from Nanxie and Xiaobaizhuang personally went to the puppet areas to call their husbands home. In the one-and-a-half-month wheat protection struggle in Bo'ai, 103 Chiang Kai-shek regular army soldiers and local bullies were won over to surrender, and 1,065 fugitive masses returned to their hometowns from the Chiang-occupied areas and were properly resettled.
