[Chahar Telegram] Pingxi (Western Hebei) and other places have overcome various difficulties and are rushing to hoe for the second time. The fifth district of Wanping is very close to Mentougou, a stronghold of the Chiang bandits. At the end of May, it suffered from bandit burning, killing, and looting, and the masses faced many difficulties, which greatly affected their production enthusiasm. The democratic government immediately allocated 20,000 jin of millet to help more than 460 disaster-stricken households, and the emotions of the masses began to stabilize. It also rectified the militia joint defense to provide armed cover for the masses' summer hoeing. Now, villages such as Dongxiaoqu and Nanxiaoqu have completed the second hoeing in fifteen or sixteen days, and some are hoeing for the third time. Households lacking food in Xixiaoqu are combining sales and transportation with weeding to solve their difficulties. Zhuanghu Village sends five or six people out for transportation and sales every day, with old men, children, and women hoeing the land. In the second district, five households including Li Zhenghou from Huangtutai Village organized a medicinal material collection team to transport and sell to Changwan (Changping and Wanping), generating a total income of more than 2.1 million yuan for the village, solving the summer hoeing grain and salt problems for households lacking food. In Liulinshui Village in the fourth district, more than 300 men and women in the village were organized to support the front, and the labor allocation team hoed the land for those who went to support the front, and the war service workers recorded work points for the allocated workers. Ninety percent of the village's land has been hoeed. In Gougezhuang, the fifth district of Laishui, military dependent Ma Xiuying and men exchanged labor, overcoming the difficulty of lacking labor, and the first two hoeings were completed through labor exchange, saving a lot of substitute labor. In Shipian Village, the second district of Huailai, labor allocation for weeding has been implemented, and production efficiency has doubled. In the past, one person hoeed one mu to one and a half mu of seedlings a day, but after labor allocation, everyone exceeded one and a half mu per day, so labor allocation production is very enthusiastic. The village militia is also divided into seven labor allocation teams, responsible for weeding and guarding at the same time, hoeing 260 mu of land in four days. In Shangshipu Village, Fangshan, most of the male laborers went out to sell labor, and the second hoeing was done by people at home and women and children, and now more than half of the village's land has been hoeed.

　　克服各种困难平西普锄二遍
    【察哈尔电】平西各地克服种种困难，突击锄二遍。宛平五区距蒋匪据点门头沟很近，五月底遭匪烧杀抢掠，群众困难重重，生产情绪受到很大影响。民主政府当即拨出二万斤小米，救济受灾户四百六十多家，群众情绪开始安定。又整顿了民兵联防，武装掩护群众夏锄。现东小区、南小区等村，在十五、六天当中，都把二遍锄完，有的正在锄三遍。西小区缺吃户在锄苗中结合运销解决困难。庄户村每天都出去五、六个人作运销，由老头、小孩、妇女锄地。二区黄土台村李正厚等五户，组织了收药材小组，往昌宛运销出口，全村共收入二百一十多万元，解决了缺吃户的夏锄粮食和吃盐问题。四区柳林水村，在支前中组织起全村男女三百多人，由拨工组给出去支前的人锄地，再由战勤工内给拨工人记工，全村土地已锄完了百分之九十。涞水五区勾各庄军属马秀英，和男子变工，克服了缺乏劳力的困难，变工锄完头二遍，节省下不少代耕工。怀来二区石片村实行拨工锄苗，生产效率提高一倍。过去一人一天锄苗一亩到亩半，拨工后每天每人都超过一亩半，因此拨工生产很热烈。该村民兵也分成七个拨工组，一面拨工锄地，一面负责警戒，四天内锄地二百六十亩。房山上石铺村大部分男劳动力都出去卖工，即由在家的人和妇女儿童们锄二遍，现在已锄了全村土地的一半以上。
