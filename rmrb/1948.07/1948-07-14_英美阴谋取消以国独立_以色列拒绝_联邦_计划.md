Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 11th: Comprehensive reports: Since June 11th, the situation in Palestine during the four weeks of the armistice has further revealed that British and American imperialism, after making compromises, are trying to abolish Israel's independence in order to maintain their rule over Palestine. During this period, they have engaged in two conspiracies: First, through the so-called United Nations "mediator" Bernadotte, during "peace negotiations" with the Arabs and Israelis, they set a trap of a so-called "federation" plan to undermine the UN General Assembly's decision on the partition of Palestine and forcibly incorporate Israel into the system of British and American puppet states in the Middle East. According to Agence France-Presse: On the 3rd of this month, Bernadotte announced his "peace proposal" submitted to both the Arab and Israeli sides on June 28th, which stipulated that the Palestinian Arab area in the UN General Assembly's partition decision, the Negev area belonging to Israel, and Jerusalem and other places that should be under UN trusteeship should be incorporated into Transjordan; the port of Haifa in Israel and the Lydda Airport near the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv should be set up as free ports and free air stations; and that Transjordan, after expanding its territory, and Israel, which had been stripped of its independence, should jointly form a "federation" under the jurisdiction of a so-called "Central Committee." Behind this so-called "federation" plan, according to former Haganah commander Sneh: "The British and Americans may have divided the real control as follows: Britain continues to rule Transjordan, while the United States rules Israel." Second, Britain and the United States used the so-called "armistice" to give the Arab armies a respite and enable them to invade convenient and strategically important positions in preparation for continuing to indulge the Arab armies in the war of conquest against the State of Israel once the conspiracy to abolish Israel's independence through "peace" failed, using threats to achieve their imperialist goals. Throughout the armistice period, Arab armies have continuously attacked Israeli-occupied areas. On June 12th, Arab armies attacked villages near the important airbase of Lydda; on the 24th, Arab armies attacked the village of El-Burj near the northern stronghold of Yakir; on the 25th, Egyptian aircraft not only bombed Israeli territory, but also openly shot at United Nations inspection aircraft; on the 3rd of this month, Arab armies in Jerusalem and many other places opened fire on Israelis. Despite facing these conspiracies and threats by American and British imperialism, Israel's determination to fight for national independence has not wavered. The Israeli government officially rejected Bernadotte's "federation" plan on the 6th. A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said: "The Israeli government cannot accept any encroachment on its territory or restrictions on its sovereignty" (Agence France-Presse). Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion also declared when British troops withdrew from Haifa at the end of June: "We are stronger on land, sea, and air than we were on the day we declared independence. Although we desire peace, if our enemies choose the path of war, we are prepared for war" (TASS).
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 11th: TASS, June 6th: British Communist Member of Parliament Piratin told a reporter from the Czech Telegraph Agency in London that the main purpose of the plan proposed by Bernadotte, the United Nations mediator in Palestine, to establish an Arab and Jewish federation is to divide the Middle East for British and American imperialists. The plan, on the one hand, aims to make Transjordan stronger than Israel, and on the other hand, places both Israel and Transjordan under permanent British and American rule. As a result, it neither conforms to the interests of the Jewish people nor to the interests of the Arab people, but only reflects the interests of British and American oil companies.

### 英美阴谋取消以国独立　以色列拒绝“联邦”计划

　　英美阴谋取消以国独立
    以色列拒绝“联邦”计划
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：自六月十一日迄今，停战四周期间的巴勒斯坦局势，已更加显示英、美帝国主义在作了妥协之后，正力图取消以色列的独立，以保持他们对巴勒斯坦的统治。在此期间，他们玩弄了两种阴谋：第一、他们经由所谓联合国“调停人”伯纳杜特在与阿拉伯、以色列进行“和平谈判”时，布置一个所谓“联邦”计划的陷阱，以破坏联大对巴勒斯坦分治的决定，并强使以色列并入英、美在中东傀儡国家的体系中。据法新社消息：本月三日，伯纳杜特公布其在六月二十八日送交阿以双方的“和平建议”，其中规定：将联大分治决定中的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人区域、属于以色列的内革布区域，以及应由联合国托管的耶路撒冷等地并入外约旦；将以色列的海法港及以色列首都特拉维夫附近的里达机场，设为自由港及自由航空站；又将扩大领土以后的外约旦和被取消了独立的以色列合组“联邦”，由一个所谓“中央委员会”管辖。在这个所谓“联邦”计划的背后，据前犹太自卫军总司令斯奈说：“英、美或许曾将真正的控制权划分如下：英国继续统治外约旦，而美国则统治以色列。”第二，英美利用所谓“停战”给阿拉伯军队以喘息机会，并使他们能够侵入便利而有战略意义的阵地以准备一旦“和平”取消以色列独立的阴谋失败后，继续放纵阿拉伯军实行对以色列国的战争征服，借威胁手法以实现其帝国主义的目的。在整个停战期间，阿拉伯军队曾不断地进袭以色列占领地区。六月十二日，阿军进攻重要航空基地里达附近的村庄；二十四日，阿军进攻北部要地亚克附近的埃尔伯村；二十五日，埃及飞机不仅轰炸以色列领土，而且公然射击联合国的视察飞机；本月三日，耶路撒冷及其他许多地方的阿军，均开枪射击以色列人。虽然面对着美英帝国主义所玩弄的这些阴谋与威胁，但是，以色列争取民族独立的意志并未动摇。以色列政府已于六日正式拒绝了伯纳杜特的“联邦”方案，该国外交部发表的公报称：“以色列政府不能接受任何对其领土的蚕食或对其主权的限制”（法新社）。以色列总理本古利安于六月底英军撤出海法之时亦宣称：“我们在陆上、海上和空中，都比宣布独立之日更为强大了。虽然我们愿望和平，但是如果我们的敌人选择战争的途径，我们就准备战争”（塔斯社）。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社六日讯：英共下院议员皮拉丁于接见捷克电报通讯社驻伦敦记者时称：联合国巴勒斯坦调停人伯纳杜特所提成立阿拉伯及犹太联邦的计划，其主要目的是为英美帝国主义者分割中东。该计划一方面要使外约旦比以色列更强，另一方面将以色列及外约旦均置于英美永久统治之下。其结果，既不符合于犹太人民的利益，也不符合于阿拉伯人民的利益，只是特别反映了英美石油公司的利益。
