    　　　　Refunds for Wrongfully Accused Industrial and Commercial Entities Should Be Handled According to Actual Circumstances.
    Comrade Editor:
    Regarding the matter of refunds and compensation for wrongly accused industrial and commercial entities mentioned in our newspaper, I have a question. I am Li Desheng from Lishui Village, Seventh District of Xingtai. In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), I rented a water mill from the landlord Zhang Linjian in Yingtou Village, paying an annual rent of forty yuan. In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the river washed away nine sections of the mill shed, and the remaining thirteen sections were silted with over four feet of sand, rendering it unusable. I was going to return home and suffer! But when I went to inform the landlord Zhang Linjian, he told me not to leave yet, and that he would repair it after autumn. When I went to ask him to repair the house in the autumn, he was ill and had no money. He told me to repair it myself and he would pay for it after it was done. At the time, I was very worried. I had no money to repair it, but if I didn't, there would still be a debt. So I sold one and a third mu of land and borrowed money from all sides, spending over nine hundred workdays, using completely new lumber. When the water mill was repaired, I went to settle the account with him, but he had already died, and I received nothing. The water mill was unusable, and his son, Zhang Taiyuan, came to the mill, not mentioning the repair, and even wanted to increase the rent, resulting in another expenditure of seventeen hundred yuan. During the land reform the winter before last, the former Yingtou Village struggled against this mill without my involvement, but during the movement, after research by the district government, the water mill was allocated to me. Now the house is leaking a bit, and last winter I bought a beam and over two hundred jin of lime to repair it, but I heard that wrongly accused industrial and commercial entities are being refunded, so I haven't proceeded with the repairs. Should this be refunded or not? Please provide an answer.
    　　　　　　　　　　　Asked by Li Desheng, written by teacher Shen Wanzhao
    Comrade Shen Wanzhao, forwarded to Comrade Li Desheng: It is the Party's policy that wrongly accused industrial and commercial entities should be refunded. However, in the specific implementation, it is necessary to distinguish the specific circumstances, and not simply refund across the board. As you mentioned, the water mill you operate belongs to the landlord Zhang Linjian, but after it was damaged, you spent your own money to repair it, and the original owner did not pay you the repair costs as agreed. In principle, it should not be simply returned, but should be handled according to the actual situation. The repair costs you added, etc., converted into capital, should belong to you. We believe that the leading organs can work with both parties to resolve this through consultation.

    　　　　Should the Masses Still Receive Dividends from Returned Factories?
    Comrade Editor:
    There is a Yuxing Iron Factory in Nanmenli, Handan City. During the land reform, because it had shares held by a traitor, it was confiscated jointly by the masses of Nanmenli in this city and Xidatun in Handan County. After the confiscation, it was simply converted into mass shares, without distribution, and continued to operate. After the correction work, we believe that this factory, except for the shares of the traitor which should be confiscated, should be returned to the original owners.
    Xidatun heard the news and wants to distribute the factory's profits. Moreover, the militia captain of Xidatun, relying on his power, often borrows money from the factory for private transactions, and recently wanted to borrow money again. An accountant sent by his village was unwilling to lend it to him (because more than 40,000 yuan borrowed previously had not been returned), so he used the power of the peasant association to criticize the accountant, saying: "I am a cadre, and also a poor peasant, how dare you not lend me money?!" This frightened the accountant. The accountant said, "I am just an ordinary person, and he is a cadre, I dare not argue with him in the future." Recently, the director of the peasant association was sent to settle accounts and distribute profits. There are also reports saying that the cadres of Xidatun are unwilling to return wrongly accused households, and the masses want to return them, but the militia captain insists on not returning them. The masses of Xidatun dare not speak up, for fear of trouble. In this situation, I feel that the militia captain of Xidatun should conduct a deep self-criticism, and the county leaders should pay attention to education and transformation. Furthermore, should the masses still receive dividends from merchants who are to be returned? Please answer this question from the newspaper (I don't think they should). Yue Qifeng, Handan City Bureau of Industry and Commerce.
    Comrade Yue Qifeng: According to the instructions of the former Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region of the Chinese Communist Party on the industrial and commercial policy: "Strictly prohibit the liquidation and struggle of industrial and commercial entities, and protect all industrial and commercial entities (including landlord and rich peasant industrial and commercial entities)." Therefore, this Yuxing Iron Factory, except for the traitor's shares which should be confiscated by the government, the private shares of the factory should be returned to the original owners. The newly invested capital during the period of mass operation should be converted into capital and established as mass shares. As for the issue of profit distribution, we believe that the profits during the period of mass operation can be settled by the masses, according to the general labor-capital profit distribution ratio, the capital's share should be given to the original owners, and the labor's share should belong to the masses. If new shares have been added after the mass operation, the capital's share of the profits can be distributed according to the share ratio. The militia captain's act of borrowing money by virtue of his power is wrong regardless of who operates the factory, and his superiors should persuade, educate, and supervise him to correct it.

    　　　　If Furniture Deposited by Foreign Merchants is Sold, the Money Should Be Returned.
    Comrade Editor:
    I am currently working on the return of industrial and commercial entities in Pengcheng according to policy. I have encountered a difficult problem and would like you to answer it in the newspaper:
    In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), there was a businessman from Ji County in Pengcheng's Xinhua Street. He came to Pengcheng at the age of fifteen to learn business, working as a shop assistant. With the salary he earned, he bought some shelves and furniture, and partnered with another person to open a business. In the 29th year (1940), fearing harassment by the Japanese Gendarmerie, he closed down the business, consolidated and stored the furniture, and went elsewhere to work as a shop assistant to make a living. However, during the "Three Checks" and the clearing of village finances last July and August, the furniture he stored was cleared and sold for money, which was used as village financial income.
    But the person came yesterday to ask for the return of his furniture, saying that he wanted to open a business again. Our opinion is that it should be returned to the original owner, but the furniture has already been sold, and the money is still stored in the cooperative. There are several other foreign merchants in the same situation. How should it be handled and compensated? Please reply. Li Fengtai, Pengcheng Market Administrator.
    Comrade Li Fengtai: As you described the situation, the furniture and shelves of this merchant from Ji County should be returned. Although the furniture has been sold, the money is still stored in the cooperative, so the proceeds from the sale should be returned to him so that he can resume business. Other foreign merchants in the same situation should be treated the same way. What do you think? If there are any problems in the implementation, please raise them again for discussion.

专栏：询问与答复

　　询问与答复
    为帮助读者研究与解决工作中的疑难问题，本报特辟“询问与答复”一栏，以便共同研究，推进工作。
    　　　　退还错斗工商业应按实际情形处理编辑同志：
    咱报上说的过去斗争了工商业要退还补偿，我有个圪＠。我是邢台七区梨水村人，我叫李德生。民国二十五年赁下本区营头村地主张林建一座水磨，每年出赁价四十元。民国二十八年被河水冲了磨棚共九间，其余十三间也淤了四尺多深的沙，这样就不能干了。回家受苦吧！但去交代房主张林建时，他说叫我暂时不要走，等到秋后他给修盖。到秋后去找他修房时，他病了，也没钱。他叫我修吧，修起后，用多少他给拿。当时我很发愁，修吧没钱，不修吧还有笔帐，于是便卖了一亩三分地，东抓西借，修好共用了九百多工，完全是新买的木材。水磨修好了去找他算帐时他已死了，分文没给。水磨不能干了，他儿张太员找到磨上，修房的事一字没提，还要增加赁价，结果又花了一千七百元。前年冬土改，前营头村把这磨没我经手即斗争了，而到运动时，经区府研究，又把这座水磨批给我了。现在这房有些漏，去冬买下一架梁，二百多斤石灰，准备修补，但听说斗争了工商业退还哩，就不待修补了。象这还退不退，请解答。
    　　　　　　　　　　　李德生问、教员申万兆代笔
    申万兆同志转李德生同志：错斗工商业应予退还，这是党的政策。但具体执行起来，就要分别具体情况，不能笼统一声退还了事。如你所说，你所经营的水磨虽系地主张林建所有，但在损坏后，你自己曾经出钱修建，原主又未依约付给你修建用过的钱，按理这不应简单退回，应按实际情况处理。你所加进去的修建费等折成资本均应归你所有。我们认为可由领导机关协同你们双方以协商办法解决。

    　　　　应退还的工厂群众是否还应分红？编辑同志：
    邯郸市南门里有个裕兴铁工厂，在土改中因有汉奸的股子，被本市南门里和邯郸县西大屯的群众共同没收啦，没收后仅仅转作群众股份，没有分配，继续营业。纠偏工作下来后，我们认为这个工厂除汉奸股子没收外，其他应退还原主。
    西大屯听说这个消息，就要把这个工厂的红分了。并且西大屯的民兵队长仗着势力，在工厂经常借钱，作私人买卖，最近又要借钱，他本村派来的一个会计不愿借给他（因以前借的四万多元还没还），他就借用农会的势力，给这个会计提意见，说：我是个干部，也是贫雇，你敢不借给我！？这样一来把会计吓坏啦，会计说咱是个百姓，他是个干部，今后可不敢给人家上劲。最近又派农会主任来，叫结帐分红，并有反映说：西大屯的干部不愿退错斗户，群众思想愿退，但民兵队长主张不退。西大屯的群众不敢吭声，怕出差。象这样的情形，我觉着西大屯民兵队长应作深刻的检查，县的领导上应注意教育改造。再者，决定退的商户，群众是否还应分红？请报社答复一下（我觉着不应分）。邯市工商局岳歧峰。
    岳歧峰同志：根据前中共晋冀鲁豫中央局关于工商业政策的指示中：“严格禁止清算斗争工商业，保护一切工商业（包括地主富农工商业在内）”的决定，这个裕兴铁工厂除了汉奸股份应由政府没收外，该工厂私人股份应该退还原主。而在群众经营期间所新投入的资本，则应转成资本，订成群众股本。至于分红问题，我们认为在群众经营时期的红利可由群众结算，按一般劳资分红比例，资方所得给原业主，劳方所得归群众，若群众经营后又增添新股，则可按股份比例分配资方所得红利。民兵队长仗势借钱问题，不管工厂由谁经营都是不对的，应由其上级说服教育监督改正。　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    　　　　外商寄存家具如被变卖，应将款项退回编者同志：
    我现在彭城作依政策退还工商业工作，发现一件难事请在报上答一下：
    在民国二十五年，彭城新华街有一个冀县商人，十五岁来到彭城学生意，当店员，以自己挣的薪津，买了些货架子与家具等，与另外一个人合伙开了一个生意，二十九年因日本宪兵队欺讹，害怕收拾停业了，把家具归并寄存起来，就到别处给人家当店员为生。但在去年七八月中三查与清理村财政时，就把他存的家具等清理变卖成钱了，作为村上财政收入。
    但本人昨天来要求退还他的家具，并说他自己要开门再干。我们的意见是应该退还原主的，可是家具已经变卖了，钱还在合作社存着，象这样的外商还有好几户，究应如何处理和赔偿，请答复为盼。　　　　彭城市场管理员李凤台
    李凤台同志：如你所说情况，这个冀县商人的家具货架是该退还的，家具虽已变卖，但钱仍存合作社，则应将变卖款项退回，以便他恢复营业。其他同样情况的外商也应同样处理，不知你们意见如何？执行中有什么问题，望再提出研究。
