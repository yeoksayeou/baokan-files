　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS, Pyongyang, 10th: Leaders of political parties and public organizations from North and South Korea held their second joint conference in Pyongyang from June 29th to July 5th. Attendees included representatives from the South Korean Democratic People's Front, the South Korean Workers' Party, the People's Republican Party, the Democratic Independence Party, the Labor People's Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Korean Independence Party, the Korean Labor Federation, the Korean Farmers' Alliance, and the North Korean Democratic People's United Front, the Labor Party (i.e., the Communist Party), the Democratic Party, the North Korean Federation of Trade Unions, and other organizations. The conference discussed the Korean political situation after the South Korean sham election and further strategies for striving for Korean reunification. The conference passed a resolution summarizing the struggle of the country's democratic forces against the South Korean sham election and politically analyzed this sham election. The resolution pointed out that the vast majority of the Korean people had conducted widespread demonstrations, worker strikes, and popular uprisings in areas such as Jeju Island to oppose the measures taken by the US military authorities to force the implementation of the sham election through terror and violence. The resolution emphasized that the Korean people refuse to recognize the "National Assembly" formed by violence (which includes eighty-four large landlords, thirty-two capitalists, twenty-three pro-Japanese officials, and the leaders of the most reactionary right-wing parties, with not a single worker or farmer) and the reactionary, anti-democratic "draft constitution" it passed. The resolution called on all democratic parties in Korea to fight for the establishment of a truly democratic and unified legislative body and a unified national government. To this end, the conference decided to establish a Supreme People's Assembly of Korea elected by election and a single Korean government composed of representatives from North and South Korea. The conference reiterated the Korean people's firm support for the Soviet proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and called on the Korean people to fight for the establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state.
    Note: Representatives of various parties and organizations from North and South Korea held their first joint conference in Pyongyang from April 19th to 27th, resolving to launch a nationwide boycott movement against the May 10th election unilaterally implemented by the US occupying authorities in South Korea; and adopted a statement to the Soviet and American governments, announcing their approval of and request for the implementation of the Soviet proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea. The Soviet Union replied expressing its agreement with this request, but the United States refused.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Seoul dispatch: US imperialism is intensifying the creation of a divided puppet government in South Korea, according to its pre-planned conspiracy. The South Korean pseudo-National Assembly, held in Seoul on May 31st, passed an extremely reactionary and anti-democratic "constitution" on July 11th and "scheduled to start organizing a new government on the 14th" (Associated Press). A Central News Agency dispatch from Seoul on June 30th revealed the overall process and purpose of the US imperialists in creating a puppet government in South Korea; according to this procedure, the pseudo-"National Assembly" is scheduled to formulate a "constitution" on August 14th and establish a government on September 15th, so as to "establish a de facto government before the UN General Assembly convenes in Paris on September 21st," attempting to obtain recognition from the UN General Assembly.

　　争取建立全国统一的人民政府
    南北鲜领袖二次集议
    美在南鲜加紧制造傀儡政府
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社平壤十日电，南北鲜各政党及公共团体领袖，六月二十九至七月五日在平壤举行第二次联席会议。出席会议者有南鲜的民主人民阵线、南鲜劳工党、人民共和党、民主独立党、劳动人民党、社会民主党、朝鲜独立党、朝鲜劳工联合会、朝鲜农民同盟及北鲜的民主人民统一阵线、劳动党（按即共产党）。民主党、北鲜职工联合会等团体的代表多人。会议讨论了南鲜伪选后的朝鲜政治情势及争取朝鲜统一斗争的进一步方策。大会通过决议一件，总结了该国民主力量反对南鲜伪选的斗争，并从政治上分析了这一伪选。决议指出，绝大多数朝鲜人民曾进行广泛示威、工人罢工与济州岛等地的人民起义，以反对美军当局以恐怖与暴力强迫实行伪选的措施。决议着重声明，朝鲜人民拒绝承认以暴力组成的“国民议会”（它包括八十四个大地主，三十二个资本家，二十三个亲日官员和最反动的右翼党派领袖，没有一个工人或农民）及其所通过的反动的反民主的“宪法草案”。决议呼吁朝鲜一切民主党派为建立真正民主的统一立法机关及统一的全国政府而斗争。为此，大会决定设立由选举产生的朝鲜最高人民议会及由南北鲜代表组成的单一朝鲜政府。会议重申朝鲜人民坚主苏联所提外国军队同时撤离朝鲜的建议，并号召朝鲜人民为建立统一、独立与民主的朝鲜国家而斗争。
    按：南北鲜各党派各团体的代表，曾于四月十九至二十七日在平壤举行第一次联席会议，决议对美占领当局在南鲜片面实行的五月十日选举，进行全国性抵制运动；并通过致苏美两国政府的声明，宣布赞同并要求实行苏联所提关于外国军队同时撤离朝鲜的建议。苏联曾复文表示同意此一要求，但美国则表拒绝。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】汉城消息：美帝国主义正按照其预定阴谋，加紧在南鲜制造分裂的傀儡政府。五月三十一日在汉城举行的南鲜伪国会，已于七月十一日通过极反动的反民主“宪法”，并“订于十四日开始筹组新政府”（合众社）。中央社六月三十日的汉城电讯，透露出美帝在南鲜制造傀儡政府的全国程序及其目的；按照此一程序，伪“国会”订于八月十四日制订“宪法”，于九月十五日成立政府，以便“九月二十一日联大在巴黎开会之前成立一事实上之政府”，企图获得联大之认可。
