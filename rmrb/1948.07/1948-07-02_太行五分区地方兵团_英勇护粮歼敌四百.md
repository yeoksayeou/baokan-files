　　Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district Local Troops
    Valiantly Protect Grain, Annihilate 400 Enemies
    [Taihang News] A certain unit of the local troops of the Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district, in the Huangshui Estuary and Shimeng Estuary areas of Huixian County, blocked a large-scale, key grain-grabbing offensive by Chiang bandits, annihilating more than 440 enemies. At the end of May, in preparation for large-scale grain grabbing, the enemy concentrated nearly eight battalions of troops in Xinxiang, including the entire 317th Regiment of the Chiang Bandit's 40th Division, two battalions of the 312th Regiment, a supply battalion directly under the division, and two companies of the 9th Artillery Regiment, and arrived in Huixian County. On the 12th, in conjunction with a local bandit unit, they began to invade the Huangshui Estuary area of Huixian County, covering and coercing a large number of laborers they had brought to grab grain. A unit of our certain troops immediately blocked them, killing and wounding more than 40 enemies. On the 16th, the enemy continued to invade Shimeng Estuary, and a certain unit launched a fierce counterattack, repelling seven enemy assaults in a row, preventing the enemy, which outnumbered us by one and a half times, from entering our inner lines. More than 400 enemies were killed and wounded, gloriously completing the task of protecting the grain. On the 18th, the enemy hastily retreated to Huixian County.
    [Taihang News] A certain unit of our People's Liberation Army ambushed local bandits grabbing grain in Anyang, and won another victory, annihilating more than 100 enemies. At dawn on the 15th, Wang Zi's entire Third Battalion of bandits from Anyang departed from Liusi, passed through Xiaoyucun and Liangggongcun, and invaded Lijia Mountain. Our pre-ambushed troops launched a three-pronged attack on the enemy, wiping out most of the enemy in one hour of combat, capturing 73 enemies alive, killing more than 50 enemies including the company commander, and seizing five light and heavy machine guns, 57 rifles and carbines, and a batch of other military supplies. In this Lijiazhuang ambush, the bandits were extremely embarrassed. According to Jiang Bandit Tian Heizi, who was captured alive in this battle, "If we don't set out, we starve, but if we do, we're finished." One day, the Third Battalion Commander summoned Wang Ning, the Bao chief, and asked him to deliver grain. The Bao chief said, "If you don't set out, I won't dare to deliver it." The Battalion Commander said, "Go back and urge the grain, I'll go tomorrow." Sure enough, he set out the next day, but when he arrived in Hanling, the Battalion Commander, who was carrying light and heavy machine guns and a lot of men, dared not go forward. He ordered the soldiers to attack Lijia Mountain. When they realized they were being ambushed by the People's Liberation Army, the rear was cut off, and the People's Liberation Army's shells hit the heavy machine guns accurately, the officers and soldiers panicked. Seeing the situation was bad, the Battalion Commander rode off in a rickshaw to escape. Two company commanders were killed.

　　太行五分区地方兵团
    英勇护粮歼敌四百
    【太行讯】我太行五分区地方兵团某部，在辉县黄水口、石门口两地阻击蒋匪大规模的重点抢粮进犯，歼敌四百四十余名。五月底，敌为准备大抢粮，集结于新乡的蒋匪四十师三一七团全部、三一二团两个营、师直属队一个辎重营、炮兵第九团两个连等将近八个营兵力，先后到达辉县城。十二日，结合土顽一部，开始进犯我辉县黄水口一带，掩护胁迫带来的大批民夫抢粮。我某部一部当即予以阻击，毙伤敌四十余名。十六日敌继续向我石门口进犯，某部展开猛烈反击，连续打退敌人七次冲锋，使一倍半于我之敌始终未能进入我内线。毙伤敌四百余人，光荣完成了保粮任务。十八日敌便慌忙撤回辉县城。
    【太行讯】我解放军某部伏击安阳抢粮土顽，又获歼敌百余的胜利。十五日拂晓，安阳匪王自全部第三营从六寺出发，经小于屯、梁公村向李家山进犯。我预伏部队分三路夹攻敌人，战斗一点钟，将敌大部消灭，共活捉敌七十三名，毙敌连长以下五十多名，缴获轻重机枪五挺，步马枪五十七支，其他军用品一部。此次李家庄伏击战中，顽匪极为狼狈。据此役被我生俘的蒋匪田黑子谈：“不出发是饿得慌，一出发就完蛋。”一天，三营长将王宁保长找来叫送粮，保长说：“你们不出发俺不敢送”。营长说：“你回去催粮吧，我明天就去。”第二天果然出发来，赶到韩陵时，带着轻重机枪及好多人马的营长不敢前进了。他指挥当兵的向李家山进攻。当发觉遭受解放军埋伏时，后路已被打断，解放军炮弹打准了重机枪，官兵们慌作一团。营长看势不好，骑上洋车偷跑了。两个连长被打死。
