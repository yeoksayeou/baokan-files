[Taiyue Telegraph] The Yangcheng County government recently sent people to various villages to inspect the spring plowing and crop conditions, and found that the drought was very serious. 180,000 mu of replanted land in the county has not yet been sown. On the 12th, it dispatched cadres to six districts to organize the masses to carry out spot sowing, dry sowing, and rush sowing. When they arrived in the villages, they first patiently mobilized the cadres and the masses ideologically, and promoted the valuable experience of overcoming drought last year. Those who have not yet spot sown should seize the time to spot sow, and those who have already spot sown should continue to spot sow more. In places with rivers, canals, and wells, irrigate and sow underground. Where water is scarce, organize to carry water for spot sowing and dry sowing. Last year, the county spot sowed a total of 5,393 mu of corn, with an average yield of eight dou and eight sheng of corn per mu. Those who waited for rain to replant only harvested an average of two dou and three sheng per mu. Those who waited for rain suffered losses, while those who rushed to plant in advance benefited. Educating the masses with last year's practical examples has achieved great results.
[Taiyue Telegraph] On the 10th, the Fifth District of Yangcheng convened a meeting of production committee members from twelve villages including Mazhai to discuss the repair of canals, the diversion of water for irrigation, and the fight against drought. These twelve villages have 1,800 mu of dry land that can be turned into paddy fields, but because many problems have not been resolved, water conservancy has not been well utilized: (1) There is no leadership or organization during canal repairs. Some people go, some people don't, and everyone is not of one mind. (2) In the past, after canals were repaired, water was used unfairly for irrigation. Those upstream watered two or three times, while those downstream could not water even once. Everyone was afraid of getting angry and fighting, and no one wanted to repair the canal and divert water. (3) In the past, every canal repair lacked a unified plan. People only started repairing when the seedlings were about to die from drought. After the repairs, no one kept track of how much labor was wasted, and whoever took the lead would suffer. After discussing the above problems, everyone agreed that to overcome the drought, canals should be repaired and water diverted immediately. The following methods were decided on the spot: (1) Unified leadership. Villages with 50 mu of water land should establish a water conservancy committee, with the production committee member primarily responsible. Solve various problems that arise during canal repair. (2) The labor used for canal repair should be shared equally according to the number of mu of water land. Households with water land cannot provide labor but can pay wages. (3) When irrigating, the upstream and downstream should take turns, watering each place once before starting over from the beginning, overcoming the past unfair phenomenon. At present, except for Mazhai, Beitoumiao and other villages where the project is relatively difficult and work has not started, most of the other villages have started work. Dingdian Village has repaired a section, which can irrigate more than 200 mu of land. The district base point work team has extracted cadres to various villages to conduct inspections and supervision, and to help various villages solve problems.

　　组织群众修渠点种阳城抓紧领导抗旱
    【太岳电】阳城县政府最近派人到各村检查春耕与青苗情形，发现荒旱十分严重，全县回茬地尚有十八万亩未曾下种。即于十二日派出干部，分赴六个区组织群众进行点种、干种、抢种。他们到了村里，首先从思想上耐心动员干部和群众，发扬去年战胜旱灾的各种宝贵经验，没点种的抓紧点种，已点种的继续多点，有河、有渠、有井的地方灌地下种，水缺的地方组织起来担水点种及干种。去年全县共点种玉茭五千三百九十三亩，每亩平均收玉茭八斗八升，等雨回茬的每亩平均只收了二斗三升。等雨的吃了亏，预先抢种的沾了光，用去年的现实例子教育群众，收到很大效果。
    【太岳电】阳城五区于十日召开马寨等十二村的生产委员开会，讨论修理水渠，引水浇地，战胜旱灾问题。这十二个村有一千八百亩旱地可以变成水田，因为有许多问题没解决，水利就没有很好的利用起来：（一）修渠时没人领导，没有组织。这个去那个不去，大家不齐心。（二）过去修了渠，浇地使水不公，在上水的两遍三遍的浇，在下水的一遍也浇不上。大家怕生气打架，谁也不想修渠引水。（三）过去每次修渠都没有统一计划，苗子快旱死了才去修，修了以后，谁误了多少工也不上帐，谁出头谁吃亏。讨论了上面这些问题，大家都认为要战胜旱灾，应该立刻修渠引水。当场决定了以下几个办法：（一）统一领导，凡有水地五十亩的村子，都成立水利委员会，由生产委员负主要责任。解决修渠中发生的各种问题。（二）修渠用的工，按水地亩数平均负担，水地户不能出工，可以出工资。（三）浇地时上下水轮流浇，都浇过一遍以后，再从头轮，克服过去不公现象。现在除马寨，北头庙等村因工程比较困难没有动工外，其余村大部已开了工。町店村已修通一段，能浇地二百多亩。区基点工作组抽出干部，到各村进行检查督促，帮助各村解决问题。
