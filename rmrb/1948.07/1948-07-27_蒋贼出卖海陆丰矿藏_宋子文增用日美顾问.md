　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 19th, quoting Hong Kong's "Chinese Business News," the Chiang Kai-shek government has again signed a secret agreement with the United States to sell tungsten, iron, and other mineral deposits in the Hailufeng area of Guangdong Province (i.e., Haifeng and Lufeng counties, located on the southeastern coast of Guangdong Province) to the United States. Sources connected to the Nanjing government admit that American surveyors frequently visit Lufeng to survey terrain and mineral deposits, with plans for mining. It is also widely reported that the United States is planning to begin port construction in Shanwei, adjacent to Haifeng, and to build railways in the area. "Chinese Business News" claims that all of this indicates that the United States is taking various measures to turn Hailufeng into an American mining center and strategic base.
　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, 23rd. According to the Tianjin "Republic Daily" of the 3rd of this month, the traitor Soong Tzu-wen is increasing his employment of Japanese as advisors in Guangdong. Horiuchi Kanjo, a Japanese war criminal who invaded China and arrived in Guangdong in mid-March to serve as a senior advisor to Soong Tzu-wen, has now returned to Japan from Guangdong and will hire a large number of Japanese agricultural, mining, and mechanical personnel to come to Guangdong to help the American-Chiang gang develop Hainan Island. According to Jinan newspapers, Ling Weisoo, a pseudo-councilor of Guangdong Province, recently revealed in a speech at the council that there are many foreigners, Japanese war criminals, and traitors among the advisors to the Guangdong provincial government, some paid in US dollars and some in Hong Kong dollars. Shanghai's "Shen Bao" reported on April 14 that, in addition to Japanese advisors, there are also American advisors such as Johnson in Hainan Island.
