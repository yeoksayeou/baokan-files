　　Students in Chiang-Controlled Northeast and North China Establish Support Association for the July 5th Bloodshed Incident
    Xinhua News Agency, North China, 22nd – Students from the Northeast and North China in Peiping have established a Joint Support Association to Protest the July 5th Massacre, sending a telegram to compatriots nationwide to denounce the Chiang and Fu bandit gangs for their crimes of massacring Northeast students. According to a report in the Peiping "New Life Daily" on the 10th: Over 10,000 students participated in the "July 9th" anti-massacre demonstration, including 35 universities and middle schools, 22 units from the Northeast and Rehe, and 13 units from Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan (the Associated Press previously mistakenly reported a total of 17 units). In addition to presenting ten solemn demands to the pseudo-Vice President Li Zongren, including "severely punish Fu Zuoyi" and "unconditionally release the students arrested in the July 5th massacre," they also demanded the return of the bodies of the killed students. In the afternoon, during the "Northeast and North China Students Protest the July 5th Massacre Mourning and Accusation Rally" held by the demonstrating students at Peking University, representatives of the Northeast students tearfully recounted how they were deceived into coming to Peiping, only to be met with machine gun fire, corpses exposed in the streets, tears shed in desolate temples in the wilderness, and even food and lodging problems left unresolved. Amidst grief and indignation, the assembly announced the establishment of the "Northeast and North China Students Joint Support Association to Protest the July 5th Massacre," issued a declaration and a telegram to compatriots nationwide, exposing the truth of the "July 5th Massacre" distorted by the Central News Agency, and denouncing the Chiang government's crimes of massacring Northeast students. They also initiated fundraising inside and outside the schools to aid the Northeast students. Surrounded by military police, all the students recited the oath in unison: "In order to demand to live and fight for survival, we, the students of Northeast and North China, resolutely stand up, unite our hearts and minds to defend our basic human rights. We are determined to adhere to our struggle with iron will and firm confidence."
