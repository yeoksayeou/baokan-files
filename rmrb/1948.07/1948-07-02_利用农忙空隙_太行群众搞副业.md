Utilizing Agricultural Off-Seasons
Taihang Masses Engage in Sideline Occupations

[Taihang News] Comprehensive Report: Many areas in Taihang have achieved great success by engaging in sideline production such as transportation and weaving during agricultural off-seasons. According to incomplete statistics from 84 villages in 10 counties, including Pingshun, Lucheng, Wuxiang, Lingchuan, Licheng, Yuanshi, Heshun, Huguan, Xiyang, and Xiangyuan, the profits from sideline occupations reached 63,949,900+ yuan (Jibi currency, same below). In Aozhi and 16 other villages in the fourth district of Pingshun alone, they earned 37,600,000 yuan from sideline occupations in four months this spring, overcoming the spring famine, supplementing the daily expenses of the masses, and also buying 79 head of livestock. After understanding the Party's policy of rectification and stabilizing their emotions, cadres and Party members in the first district of Heshun led the masses to seize the agricultural slack season to carry out various sideline productions, earning 11,000,000+ yuan in two months and overcoming the spring famine. Zhao Maohai, the production team leader of Liugou Village in the second district of Wuxiang, after leading the completion of spring plowing, immediately seized the gap and led eight groups to pull coal, boil saltpeter, and burn lime, earning 3,192,900 yuan and 33 dan and 6 dou of rice in one month. Zhao Linyuan, a middle peasant, understood our Party's policy towards middle peasants and went to carry coal whenever he had free time, earning more than 100,000 yuan by himself. In many areas with more serious spring famines, the enthusiasm of the masses for sideline production is even higher. Ma Yueshan, a labor hero in Xichuan Village in the third district of Huguan, led the mutual aid team to squeeze out labor and animal power to engage in sideline occupations while sowing and hoeing wheat, selling grain, used clothes, and mountain goods. Ma Demao, the director of the cooperative, led women to go up the mountain to cut small leaves and boil them to dye black cloth. Agricultural work was not delayed at all, and they earned 1,545,500+ yuan and 13,000 jin of coal, solving the difficulty of burning coal during the summer busy season. Under the slogan of "organizing mutual assistance, combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and self-salvation through production," ten villages including Lujiayu, Zhaobi, and Mengbi in Xiyang meticulously organized the surplus labor force and sought various production avenues. For example, selling eggs, transporting pig iron, carrying coal, boiling saltpeter, selling paper, opening iron furnaces, opening coal kilns, cutting mountain goods, and digging medicinal materials, earning a total of 5,600,000+ yuan, as well as 7 shi and 1 dou of corn and 1 shi and 6 dou of millet. The land was not barren, the stomachs were not hungry, and four donkeys and mules were bought back. Sideline production in Mengbi Village solved the problem of no food for 26 households with 104 people. Others, such as Pianliangtou in the fifth district of Xiangyuan, all 12 households in the village "work in the fields during the busy season and do brush-making during the slack season." Feng Ergou and two others alone squeezed out time to make 180 brushes in 70 days, earning 5,216,000+ yuan, enough to buy 7 shi and 8 dou of rice. At present, the summer harvest is coming to an end in various places. Many villages are combining hoeing seedlings, adjusting labor and animal power, and squeezing out labor and time to engage in sideline occupations to increase income.

[Taiyue News] Dahe and Yue Village in the second district of Yicheng have gained great profits by digging medicinal materials and transporting charcoal during agricultural off-seasons. After the spring plowing and sowing were completed, Li Pinyuan and Hou Sheng, the managers of the Dahe Cooperative, organized the masses to squeeze out time to go up the mountain to dig Atractylodes lancea. The cooperative's drugstore first organized more than 20 people to take the lead in going up the mountain, and they dug three to four hundred jin in ten days, which could be sold for more than 500,000 yuan. Seeing that they gained a lot of profit, the masses, both men and women, young and old, went up the mountain to dig medicine, and they dug more than 5,000 jin in less than 20 days. Just as the Handan medicine merchants came here to buy, they sold 6,000,000 yuan at once, enough to cover the whole village's annual expenses for salt and cotton. Ma Liji and Ma You of Yue Village also squeezed out time to organize the masses in Nanma, Lengquan, and Laowanggou villages to burn and transport charcoal, with a total of 98 people and more than 20 livestock participating. They transported more than 32,400 jin of charcoal in 25 days, earning 3,888,000 yuan. An old man in his sixties also earned 30,000 yuan. Only two or three households in the entire Yue Village did not participate, and each household earned an average of 30,000 to 60,000 yuan, which not only solved the spring famine in the whole village, but also bought two livestock.

　　利用农忙空隙
    太行群众搞副业
    【太行讯】综合报导：太行许多地区利用农忙空隙进行运输、纺织等副业生产获得很大成绩。据平顺、潞城、武乡、陵川、黎城、元氏、和顺、壶关、昔阳、襄垣等十个县八十四个村庄不完全统计，副业获利达六千三百九十四万九千九百余元（冀钞，下同）。仅平顺四区奥治等十七个村，在今春四个月中，副业赚洋三千七百六十万元，克服了春荒，添补了群众日常零用，还买进牲口七十九头。和顺一区各村干部党员了解整党政策、稳定情绪后，领导群众抓紧农闲进行多方面的副业生产，两个月赚洋一千一百余万元，渡过了春荒。武乡二区柳沟村生产队长赵毛孩领导着完成春耕后，即抓紧空隙，领导八个组，拉煤、熬硝、烧石灰等，一个月赚洋三百一十九万二千九百元，赚米三十三石六斗。中农赵林元了解了我党对中农的政策，一有空闲就去驮煤，一个人就赚洋十万余元。不少春荒较严重地区，群众进行副业生产的情绪更高。壶关三区西川村劳动英雄马月山领导互助大队，在下种锄麦中，挤出劳畜力搞副业，贩卖粮食、估衣、山货。合作社长马德茂领导妇女上山割小里叶，煮染黑布，农事一点没耽误，还赚洋一百五十四万五千余元，拉煤一万三千斤，解决了夏忙中烧煤的困难。昔阳路家峪、赵壁、孟壁等十个村在“组织互助、农副业结合，生产自救”的口号下，细密地组织了剩余劳力，寻找各种生产门路。如贩卖鸡蛋、运生铁、担煤、熬硝、卖纸、开铁炉、开煤窑、砍山货、刨药材，共获利五百六十余万元，另玉茭七石一斗，小米一石六斗。地没荒，肚没饿，还买回驴骡四头。孟壁村的副业生产解决了二十六户一百零四口人没饭吃的困难。其他如襄垣五区偏梁头，全村十二户扎刷布刷，“农忙上地农闲干”。仅冯二苟等三个人，七十天内抽空扎了一百八十个，即赚五百二十一万六千余元，可买米七石八斗。目前各地夏收快要结束，不少村庄结合锄苗，调剂劳畜力，挤出劳力与时间搞副业，以增加收入。
    【太岳讯】翼城二区大河、岳庄等村，利用农忙空隙挖药材运木炭，得利很大。春耕下种完了，大河合作社经理李丕元、侯升同志即组织群众，抽空上山挖苍术。合作社药铺先组织了二十多个人带头上山，十天工夫就挖了三四百斤，能卖五十多万元，群众看到得利很多，男女老少都上山挖药，不到二十天就挖了五千多斤。正好邯郸药商来此收买，一下卖了六百万元，足够全村全年食盐、棉花的开销。岳庄村马立吉、马有等也抽空组织南马、冷泉、老王沟等村群众烧运木炭，共有九十八个人，二十多个牲口参加，二十五天运炭三万二千四百多斤，赚洋三百八十八万八千元，有个六十多岁的老汉也赚了三万元。岳庄全村只两三户没参加，每户平均赚到三万元至六万元，除解决了全村春荒外，还买了两个牲口。
