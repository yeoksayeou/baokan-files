　　Our Army Implements Lenient Policy
    Restores Freedom to Officials of the Puppet Henan Provincial Government
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Frontline, 1st] Over a hundred officials and staff members of various levels of government organs of the Kuomintang Henan Provincial Government, including Secretary-General of the Henan Provincial Government Ma Lingfu, Director of the Education Department Wang Haihan, Director of the Taxation Office Li Yongji, and personnel from the Kuomintang Henan Provincial Party Headquarters' newspaper, "Minguo Daily," were identified among the prisoners of war during the liberation of Kaifeng by the frontline headquarters and political department of the People's Liberation Army and have been granted their freedom. They were captured along with a large number of Chiang's troops during the PLA's capture of the Kuomintang provincial government's fortified positions and in other battles. Upon their release, in addition to expressing their gratitude to the People's Liberation Army, they unanimously praised the PLA's lenient policy. Ma Lingfu said, "The PLA's leniency is something I have only seen in my thirty years in politics, and the hearts of the people across the country will turn to you." Based on his personal experience, Mr. Ma also praised the PLA's bravery in combat and its wise implementation of various policies. He expressed his indignation at Chiang's aircraft indiscriminately bombing Kaifeng, saying, "The war ended two days ago, and they are still bombing and strafing day and night, killing the old people of Kaifeng and destroying the city of Kaifeng, bombing Kaifeng into this state." He also expressed his resentment towards the arrogance of Kuomintang officers, especially Chiang's direct line officers, who often insulted government officials. Wang Haihan expressed his intention to work hard to reform himself in the future. After the end of the battle in the city, Mr. Ma, Mr. Wang, and others separately contacted the original staff members of various agencies and people from all walks of life to assist the PLA in restoring order in the city. It is reported that Ma Lingfu is sixty-five years old, from Xianyang, Shaanxi, and a graduate of Meiji University in Japan. He served as Speaker of the Shaanxi Provincial Council of the Kuomintang, representative of Yan Xishan, member of the Anhui Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, and member of the Shaanxi Provincial Assembly. After the surrender of Japan, he served as a member and concurrently secretary-general of the Henan Provincial Government. Wang Haihan, courtesy name Gongdu, is forty-seven years old, from Mengjin, Henan, a graduate of Beijing Normal University, and a graduate of the second session of the Kuomintang Central Training Corps' Party and Government Senior Class. He served as the principal of Henan Provincial High School, professor at Henan Training and Political Academy, and a member of the second and third National Political Councils. He currently serves as the Director of the Education Department of Henan Province of the Kuomintang, a member of the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters, and a standing supervisor of the Henan branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League.
