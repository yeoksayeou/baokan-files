　　[Northern Yue News] Since the 19th, the entire Northern Yue District has received welcome rain, which has not stopped as of the evening of the 20th. The soil is thoroughly soaked. The peasants are overjoyed and are preparing to replant and rush-plant late autumn crops. According to experienced old farmers: this rain is very even and gentle. He said: This area has been severely dry, and this rain will guarantee the planting of late autumn crops. He also said: There is a lot of rain in the dog days of summer, and the leadership must not become complacent because of this one rain, thinking that everything is fine. They should seize the time to lead the masses to rush-plant and help solve various difficulties, such as adjusting late autumn crop seeds. "Planting one day earlier means harvesting one day earlier," and time cannot be delayed any longer.
　　[Chahar Electric] From June 29th to July 10th, rain fell successively in various parts of Western Hebei, and most areas have been thoroughly soaked. The drought-stricken seedlings in areas that were not soaked have also recovered. From the 11th, the five special districts of Northern Yue also received widespread and thorough rain.
　　[Our Newspaper News] Exclusive interview with the General Branch: "People are worried when it doesn't rain!" A reporter recently visited the Pingshan First District Government, hoping to get some good news to relieve the worries of the masses. The district party secretary and district head, along with other responsible cadres, went to the county for a meeting to summarize land reform and rectify their thinking, and have not returned for a month. The district committee is empty, and the industrial assistant of the district government has gone to the countryside to supervise the summer grain requisition. Besides the financial assistant organizing accounts, only Secretary Hao is left in the district to be responsible for everything. Secretary Hao said that he is so busy with "affairs" that he cannot even take a nap at noon. Indeed, during the one hour that the reporter spoke with him, the courtyard was filled with people waiting to solve problems—land disputes, food and lodging for passing soldiers, approving medical expenses for cadres, water conservancy conflicts, marriages, and divorces... During the conversation, Secretary Hao expressed his hardship due to the lack of cadres. He said: After the land conference last October, the cadres went to the countryside to engage in land reform. On the 18th of last month, they did not return to the district and went to the county for a meeting. Production has not been done well. The position of industrial assistant was only established half a month ago, and the organization is very unsound. Regarding the county government's leadership of production, at first he only thought about the numbers the county wanted—sown area, tree planting and afforestation figures, labor force figures, livestock increase and decrease figures, etc. He said: I can't go down there alone, and I can't get the numbers from the villages, so I haven't completely compiled them. I asked Secretary Hao to find the county's instructions on production. Although there was nothing about drought resistance and famine preparedness (it was heard that the county government's drought resistance instructions had been issued when this article was being written, but they had not been seen), from the county government's instructions on April 12, it seems that the county was paying attention to leading production. After reviewing the inadequacy of production leadership, the instructions pointed out: "At present, the leadership should seize this busy farming season and quickly turn to production, putting in full effort, especially the district heads should focus on leading production and put most of their energy into leading production work." Regarding the content of production work, it briefly stated: "In-depth education on policies to stabilize and improve the masses' production enthusiasm." The method is to "grasp the key points and drive the general." A month later, the county government issued another notice to check production, with the main items being to check whether substitute farming, grain loans, and land reform floating wealth were used for production. Mutual aid and labor allocation should be organized for households lacking labor, and whether land certificates have been issued, etc. On June 7, another emergency notice was issued to concentrate efforts on wheat harvesting, sowing, weeding, and not leaving an inch of land uncultivated. Based on these instructions, the reporter planned to go to key villages to understand the implementation. Secretary Hao said that all villages are the same, with nothing good or bad. The reporter still visited several villages and found that the problem of substitute farming had been preliminarily resolved. When planting in the spring, the fruits of land reform—grain was lent to poor peasants and landlords and rich peasants who had no seeds, which was well done. However, on the other hand, a serious distance was also found between instructions and reality. For example, a lot of irrigated land was abandoned, more than 20 mu in Mengling, 30 mu in Yongle, and 20 mu in Yiyang. Due to the drought, how much dry land was abandoned could not be calculated for a while. According to village cadres: these were all taken away from landlords and rich peasants, and some middle and poor peasants also abandoned them because there was no one at home or a lack of labor. The masses in waterless areas automatically requested to plant the abandoned irrigated land. Two households in Dongjiao planted 4 mu of the Yanbao village, willing to pay the burden themselves. There are still 4 mu in this village that no one has planted. The masses in Yanbao planted 20 mu of irrigated land in Mengling and Qudi. In order to stabilize and improve production enthusiasm, it is urgently necessary to determine land rights. The county government's May production inspection notice listed the issuance of land certificates as an item, but a village branch secretary said: The superiors always say to issue land certificates, they have said it three times, but they have not been issued, and they don't know why. The issue of organizing the masses for mutual aid in production seems to be still in the debate stage. The county government's instructions on April 12 did not mention this at all. Secretary Hao of the district government said: Irrigated land has a lot of scattered occupations, and it is often busy, so mutual aid is inconvenient. The county government has instructed to organize mutual aid and labor allocation for households lacking labor. The reporter asked village cadres in many ways, and the answers were either that the masses naturally helped each other solve the problem, or that the land of households lacking labor was not much and there was no problem. The reporter felt that although some problems had been solved in rural production in Pingshan First District, it had not formed an organized mass movement. Drought resistance and famine preparedness have not created a mass upsurge. Although the county's leadership has a policy for production, there is no specific organization for implementation, and there are instructions, but no inspection or supervision. As a result, the policies and instructions cannot be well realized. The masses in a certain village said that to resist drought and prepare for famine, they should now plant more vegetables, yams, radishes, and turnips, which can be harvested a lot and can last for half a year. If it rains in the second heat, they can plant buckwheat, but they can't buy buckwheat seeds. Some of the masses have dry land sandwiched in the middle of irrigated land and demand to irrigate it like last year; some poor peasants lack fertilizer too much... Regarding these demands, the leadership has not yet timely organized the masses to help them realize them to the greatest extent possible within the limits of possibility. Some cadres have relaxed their leadership of production in their thinking. Secretary Hao of the district government said: "The masses' production enthusiasm is still high, and they can do it without leadership." This is a laissez-faire attitude towards production leadership, and this idea must be overcome, and the leadership should earnestly check it.

### 北岳区喜雨赶快抢种　平山一区生产自流应立即改变

　　北岳区喜雨赶快抢种
  　平山一区生产自流应立即改变
    【北岳讯】北岳全区从十九日起降喜雨，迄二十日晚未停。地里都已下透。农民们喜形于色，纷纷准备补种和抢种晚秋。据有经验的老农民谈：这雨阴的甚匀，下的很缓，他说：这一带旱的太厉害了，有这一场雨，能保证种上晚秋。又说：伏天用雨很多，领导上绝不能因为下了这一场雨，思想上就麻痹起来，认为已经万事大吉。应该抓紧时间，领导群众抢种，帮助解决各种困难问题，如调剂晚秋作物种子等。“早种一天早收一天”，时间已经不能再拖延了。
    【察哈尔电】自上月二十九号至本月十号，平西各地相继落雨，大部地区已下透，未透地区受旱禾苗也已转缓过来。北岳五专各地从十一日起亦普降透雨。
    【本报讯】总分社专访：“不下雨人们可愁了！”记者日前走访平山一区区政府，希望得到一些为群众解愁的好消息。该区区委书记及区长等负责干部到县里开会总结土改、整顿思想，为时一月尚未归来。区委会空无一人，区政府实业助理员下乡督促夏征，区上除财政助理员在整理帐目外，只留郝秘书一人负责一切。郝秘书说光“事务”就忙得连午睡都不能歇。真的，记者与他谈话的一点钟内，院里挤满群众，等候解决问题——土地纠纷，过路军人的食宿问题，批干部医药费，水利矛盾，结婚离婚…………。谈话中间，郝秘书表示很以干部缺乏为苦。他说：从去年十月土地会议后，干部都下乡搞土改，上月十八日他们没有回区，就都到县上开会去了。生产没有好好搞，实业助理员这个职位才确定了半个月，机构很不健全。关于县政府对生产的领导，开始他只想到县上要数目字的事——播种面积，植树造林数字，劳动力数字，牲畜增减数字等等。他说：我一个人也下不去，往村里要不上来，我也没有完全统计好。我请郝秘书找出县上有关生产的指示，其中虽然没有关于抗旱备荒的东西（写稿时闻县府抗旱指示下来了，但未见到），但从四月十二日县政府的指示看来，县上是注意领导生产的。该指示在检讨生产领导不够之后，即指出：“目前领导上应抓紧这一农忙季节，很快转入生产，把劲头使足，尤其是各区长应以领导生产为主，把绝大部分力量放在生产工作领导上”。关于生产工作的内容，略称：“深入政策的教育，稳定与提高群众生产情绪”。方法是“抓紧重点，带动一般。”隔了一个月，县政府又发出一个检查生产的通告，主要项目为检查代耕、贷粮贷款及土改浮财是否用于生产。缺乏劳力户应组织互助拨工，并问发下土地证没有等。六月七日，又发了集中力量进行麦收、播种、锄苗、不荒一分地的紧急通告。根据这些指示，记者打算到重点村了解一下执行情形。郝秘书说各村都一样，没有什么好坏。记者还是访问了几个村庄，发现代耕问题已获得初步解决。春季下种时，土改果实——粮食借给无种子的贫农及地主富农，办的也不错。但是另一方面，也发现指示与实际中间存在着严重的距离。譬如水浇地荒芜了不少，孟岭有二十余亩，永乐三十来亩，义羊二十余亩，旱地因为天旱，究竟荒了多少，一时统计不出来。据村干部谈：这些都是抽换给地主富农的，也有个别中贫农因家里没人或缺乏劳力而荒的。无水地的群众，自动要求种荒芜的水地，东焦两户群众就种了烟堡村四亩，自己情愿出负担。该村还有四亩尚无人种。烟堡群众则种了孟岭、曲堤二十来亩水地。为稳定与提高生产情绪，目前亟需应该确定地权。县府五月生产检查通告曾把发土地证列为一项，但是某村支部书记说：上边老说发土地证，说了三次了，还没有发下来，不知道为什么？关于组织群众生产互助问题，似乎还停留在争论阶段，县政府四月十二日的指示根本未提此事，区政府郝秘书说：水地零碎营生多，经常忙，互助起来倒不方便。县府曾指示对缺乏劳力户要组织互助拨工，记者多方问村干部，所得回答不是说群众自然的就互相帮忙解决了，就是说缺乏劳力户的地都为数不多，没有问题。记者觉得平山一区农村生产中虽有若干问题已经解决，但还没有形成有组织的群众运动。抗旱备荒也没有造成群众热潮。县的领导上对于生产虽有方针，但没有具体组织执行，有指示，没有检查督促。结果方针指示都不能很好实现。某村群众说要抗旱备荒，现在就要多种菜、山药、萝卜、蔓菁。收的很多，可顶半年粮。二伏下了雨，可以种荞麦，但是买不到荞麦种子。有的群众有夹在水地中间的旱地，要求象去年一样浇水；有的贫农肥料太缺乏………对于这些要求，还未见领导上及时的组织群众，在可能范围内，以最大的努力助其实现。有些干部思想上放松了生产领导，区政府郝秘书说：“群众生产情绪还高，不用领导，也一样的干得起来”。这就是对生产领导的放任自流思想，这种思想必须加以克服，领导上应切实加以检查。
