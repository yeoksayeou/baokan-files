Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd: Qingdao News: Qingdao has now become a complete American colony. Most of the city is under the direct control of the US military: the Dagang Wharf in the west is entirely under US military control, guarded by US soldiers; the south bank of the Zhanqiao Pier and Tuandao Island are US military garrison areas, with US military arsenals and airports on Tuandao Island; in the east, several important mountains east of the original site of Shandong University (such as the entire Qingdao Mountain and Zhanshan Mountain) are completely off-limits to Chinese people; the Taitung Dengzhou Road area to the north is a US military semi-controlled area, and citizens must have US military passes to travel there; the Cangku Airport is controlled by the US Air Force; several large buildings in the city, such as the former Japanese naval club on Taiping Road, the Donghai Hotel on Nanhai Road, and the original site of Shandong University, are all occupied by the US military. Currently, only the Baisha River water source in the north of the city is not yet under US military control, but the US military has notified Chiang Kai-shek's side that if the situation becomes "urgent," the US military will send sailors to defend it. The US military has stationed in Qingdao the Naval Base Command, Marine Corps, Marine Corps Military Police, Naval Patrol Team, and other eleven military units, as well as the Intelligence Office directly under the US Military Operations Department, the Intelligence Office of the Pacific Fleet, and the Intelligence Group of the Port Transportation Office, and eight intelligence agencies in total, in addition to the US Consulate, the American YMCA, and the US Military Officers' Club. US troops stationed in Qingdao frequently conduct live ammunition exercises in the city, wantonly abuse and kill Chinese residents, arbitrarily inspect Chinese shops and residences, rape Chinese women, force barmaids to submit photos to the US military, run over people with cars at will, shoot and kill people for no reason, arrest Chinese people and torture them with electricity for fun, and even detain Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers for forced labor, committing all kinds of evil. According to Chiang Kai-shek's official statistics, in the past year alone, there have been more than 260 incidents of atrocities committed by US troops stationed in Qingdao, resulting in more than 400 casualties among citizens. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities in Qingdao have adopted a policy of covering up US military atrocities and have allowed the US military to handle incidents caused by the US military unilaterally. However, the people of Qingdao are increasingly launching strong resistance to US military atrocities. After rickshaw puller Lian Mingcheng was stabbed to death by a US soldier on March 31 last year, rickshaw pullers went on strike for a day, and students from Shandong University also held a rally in support, demanding that the US military withdraw from China immediately. On April 1 this year, two US soldiers beat a small stallholder with sticks, arousing the anger of the stallholders, who rose up in resistance, resulting in a three-hour melee, resulting in minor casualties on the US side. On the same day, a US soldier shot and wounded a bar accountant for no reason, and all the staff in the counter came out and beat the US soldier severely. According to the Qingdao Military and Civilian Daily on June 9, on June 3 and 4, the US fleet conducted a landing exercise on the Shazikou sea off Qingdao, and the fishing grounds and fishing gear of the local villages were mostly destroyed, causing heavy losses to the fishermen. On May 25, five fishermen, including Xu Qianyi, were fishing in Qianwan (one and a half nautical miles east of Tuandao Island) when their boat was overturned by a US landing craft No. 12, injuring one person and causing losses of 850 million Chiang Kai-shek currency in materials. The fishermen were angry and negotiated with the US Military Police Command, but the US side ignored them.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, via TASS, Shanghai, 16th of last month, quoting news from the Kuomintang CC-affiliated newspaper Shen Bao, reported that American imperialism is preparing to occupy Qingdao indefinitely. The term of the "lease contract" for the houses used by the US military in Qingdao has been extended to July 1, 1950. The US military authorities stationed in Qingdao have purchased the Donghai Hotel for 700,000 US dollars and are still purchasing two other large houses to serve as dormitories for US military officers and their families. Not long ago, the American magazine "World Report" published an article revealing that the number of US troops stationed in Qingdao was 2,700 ground troops and 3,300 naval personnel. Truman signed a legislative bill on March 8, approving the indefinite extension of the term of stationing of US troops in Asia, China, and other places.

　　蒋贼媚美卖国政策下青岛成了美帝殖民地
    【新华社山东三日电】青岛消息：青岛现已变成十足的美国殖民地。该市全市大部地区为美军直接控制：西边的大港码头全由美军管制，由美军站岗警戒；南岸栈桥和团岛为美军驻防区，团岛并设有美军火库和飞机场；东边从山东大学原址往东几个重要山地（如整个青岛山、湛山），根本不准中国人接近；往北台东登镇州路一带，为美军半控制区，市民来往该处，须持有美军通行证；沧口飞机场为美空军控制；市内几个大建筑物如太平路原日本人建筑的海军俱乐部、南海路的东海饭店及山东大学原处，皆为美军占据。目前仅市北白沙河水源地尚未为美军控制，但美军已向蒋方通知：情况一“紧急”，美军即派水兵防守。美军在青岛驻有海军基地司令部、海军陆战队、海军陆战宪兵队、海军巡逻队等十一军事单位，和美军作战部直属情报处、西太平洋舰队所属情报处、港口运输处情报组等八个情报机关，此外尚有美领事馆、美国青年会、美军官俱乐部等。驻青美军经常在市内举行实弹演习，恣意虐杀中国居民，任意检查中国商号、住宅，强奸中国妇女，强迫酒吧间女招待向美军呈缴照片，汽车随便撞死人，无故开枪打死人，将中国人捕去施以电刑取乐，甚至扣押蒋军士兵作苦工，无恶不作。据蒋官方统计，仅去年一年间，驻青美军暴行事件即达二百六十多件，伤亡市民四百多人。青市蒋当局对美军暴行皆采包庇态度，并允美军肇事由美方单方处理。但青市人民对美军暴行则日益掀起强烈反抗，去年三月卅一日人力车夫廉明诚被美军刺伤致死后，人力车夫曾全体罢工一天，山东大学学生亦举行集会声援，要求美军迅速退出中国去。今年四月一日，二美兵棒打小摊贩，激起摊贩众怒。群起反抗。造成三小时之混战，结果美方略有死伤。同日一美兵无故开枪打伤酒吧间帐房，柜内伙计全体出动，将该美兵痛打一顿。另据六月九日青岛军民日报透露：六月三、四两日，美舰队在青岛沙子口海面举行登陆演习，当地适村渔场，渔具、网绳多被毁坏，渔民损失惨重。五月二十五日有徐谦益等渔民五人，驾船捕鱼，在前湾（在团岛东一海里半）遭美十二号登陆艇一艘撞翻，一人受伤，物资损失达蒋币八万万五千万元，渔民愤激，向美宪兵司令部交涉，美方竟置之不理。
    【新华社陕北电】据塔斯社上海上月十六日电引国民党ＣＣ系报纸申报的消息透露，美帝国主义是准备无限期地盘踞在青岛了。美军在青所用房屋的“租赁合同”的期限已延至一九五○年七月一日。驻青美国军事当局已以七十万美元购得东海大旅馆，且还在购买其他两幢大房子，作为美国军官和家属的宿舍。不久前美杂志“世界报导”曾载文披露美在青驻军数目为地面部队二千七百名，海军三千三百名。杜鲁门曾于三月八日签署一项立法案，核准将驻在亚洲、中国等地的美军驻扎期限无限期延长。
