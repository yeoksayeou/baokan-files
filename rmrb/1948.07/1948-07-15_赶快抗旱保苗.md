　　Hurry to Fight Drought and Protect Seedlings
    For use on public blackboards and rooftop broadcasts

    Since the beginning of summer, most areas in our region haven't had a thorough rain, and the seedlings are suffering from severe drought. In some places, due to the drought, wheat stubble fields haven't even been sown yet. The Administrative Committees of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region, the Taihang Administrative Office, the Northern Yue Third Prefectural Committee, and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office have all instructed governments and Party cadres at all levels to organize all available labor, both men and women, old and young, to quickly protect seedlings and rush planting, and to fight against the drought. Everyone knows that it's crucial to seize the time for planting seedlings; delaying it by even one day will cause the seedlings to wither from drought, potentially leading to famine. Our masses have experience in overcoming disasters. Now, we must draw on past experiences and take action quickly. Dig canals where needed, dig wells where possible, and dig water cellars where you can. Hoe and water more to protect the seedlings. Those who haven't sown yet should hurry to spot-plant and interplant; saving one more seedling means one more harvest. The Agricultural and Forestry Department's experiences in drought-resistant planting and seedling protection can be used for reference in various places. In addition, we must quickly prepare for the lean season, save food, and save a little now so we can suffer less in the future.

　　赶快抗旱保苗
    供大众黑板和屋顶广播用
    入夏以来，咱区大部地方没下透雨，小苗旱得不行，有些地方，因为天旱，麦茬地还没种上。晋冀鲁豫边和晋察冀边区行政委员会，太行行署、北岳三地委、冀鲁豫行署都批示各级政府和党员干部，组织男女老少全半劳力，赶快保苗抢种，和旱灾斗争。大家都知道，上苗要抓紧时间，耽误一天，就要旱坏小苗，有造成灾荒的危险。我群众都有战胜灾荒的经验，现在，就要发挥过去的经验，赶快行动起来，该开渠的开渠，能打井的打井，能挖水窑的挖水窑，多锄多浇，保住小苗。没下种的赶快点种寄种，多活一棵，就能多收一棵。农林厅抗旱播种和保苗经验，可供各地参考。另外，还要快做渡荒准备，节约粮食，眼下省一点，将来就可少受制。
