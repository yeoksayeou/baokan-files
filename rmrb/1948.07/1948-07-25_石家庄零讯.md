Based on the recipients' contributions to production and the award regulations, awards were given in six grades.

　　304 Department Renovation Factory Increases Production Efficiency
　　△Since its reorganization, the 304 Department Renovation Factory has seen a steady increase in production efficiency. In the past, the numerous units and lack of unified leadership led to lax discipline and scattered work. Since the reorganization, leadership has been unified, the division of labor is clear, specific production plans have been established, and workers' enthusiasm for production has surged. Ironworkers' production has more than doubled compared to before; in a certain project, bricklayers completed an eight-day project in only four days, saving more than 50 million yuan (border currency); carpenters also saved one-third of the labor in completing a certain task.
　　Yumin Flour Mill Increases Production by Implementing Over-Quota Award System
　　△The output of Yumin Flour Mill No. 2 in June exceeded the previous monthly average output by 88.9 percent. After the workers actively repaired and improved the machines, the factory implemented an over-quota award system, stipulating that for production exceeding the original standard by up to 1,000 bags, each bag would be awarded 2,000 yuan (border currency, same below), and for production exceeding 1,000 bags, each bag would be awarded one catty of millet. The workers' enthusiasm for production is increasing daily. In June, production exceeded the original estimated work standard by 19.8 percent, and the workers received more than 1,700 catties of award-winning millet.
