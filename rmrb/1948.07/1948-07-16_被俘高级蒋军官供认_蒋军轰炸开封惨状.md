Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, July 12th:

　　Captured senior Chiang Kai-shek army officer, You Lingyun, Chief of Staff of the 66th Division, and others, confessed to the various brutal facts of the Chiang Kai-shek army's indiscriminate bombing and destruction of Kaifeng during the Kaifeng Campaign, powerfully exposing the Chiang gang's continuous cover-up of this crime in recent days. You said: Chiang Kai-shek had ordered Liu Maoen, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, and Li Zhongxin, Commander of the 66th Division, to "spare no sacrifice" to defend Kaifeng to the end, and then immediately sent a large number of American-made aircraft to bomb indiscriminately and aimlessly, even killing and wounding many Kuomintang troops. The 18th Regiment of the 13th Brigade, which was guarding the south city, suffered heavy casualties from the bombing. Cheng Kaijun, Major General and Deputy Commander of the Chiang regime's Henan Air Defense Command, said: "Our planes (referring to Chiang's planes), in order to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing, recklessly dropped bombs and incendiary bombs in places such as the South Gate and East Gate, causing a large fire. Even the officers and soldiers of our anti-aircraft artillery battalion in the southwest of the city were killed and wounded by the bombing." Wang Zhongfu, Deputy Brigade Commander of the First Security Brigade of Henan Province under Chiang's regime, pointed out that Chiang's planes were bombing indiscriminately without any target, saying: "When I led my troops to fight on Freedom Road, the planes were bombing nearby; the area around Xiaonanmen and Nanguan was bombed into a sea of fire, a tragic sight. Xiangguo Temple had no fighting at the time and no People's Liberation Army, but it was also bombed and caught fire." Sun Xitang, Deputy Brigade Commander of the Second Security Brigade of Henan Province, also said: "As a result of the indiscriminate bombing by the planes, many civilians were killed near the provincial government, and even the provincial government building, which was still being defended by us (referring to the Chiang army) at the time, was hit by two large bombs." Zhang Jie, Brigade Commander of the 13th Brigade of the 66th Division, confessed that the large-scale arson and burning of civilian houses by the unit was also one of the causes of the major fire in Kaifeng.

　　被俘高级蒋军官供认
    蒋军轰炸开封惨状
    【新华社开封前线十二日电】开封战役被俘的蒋军高级军官六十六师参谋长游凌云等，供认此次蒋军狂炸及破坏开封之种种残暴事实，有力地揭穿了蒋匪连日对于这一罪行的掩饰。游说：蒋介石曾命令河南省府主席刘茂恩及六十六师师长李仲辛，对开封应“不惜一切牺牲”，坚守到底，并随即派来大批美造飞机，毫无目的地乱肆轰炸，连国民党部队也被炸死伤很多，守南城十三旅十八团就被炸伤亡很大。蒋记河南防空指挥部少将副指挥官程开俊说：“我机（指蒋机）为阻挡解放军前进，不顾一切在南门及东门等地乱投炸弹及燃烧弹，引起了大火。连我们在城西南的高射炮营官兵也有被炸死炸伤的。”蒋记河南省保安第一旅副旅长王忠辅指明蒋机漫无目标的滥炸时称：“我带部队在自由路作战时，飞机就在附近轰炸；小南门及南关一带炸成一片火海，惨不忍睹。相国寺当时并无战事，也无解放军，亦被炸起火。”河南保安二旅副旅长孙喜堂亦称：“由于飞机乱炸的结果，在省府附近炸死了许多平民，连当时尚为我们（指蒋军）据守的省府大楼也中了两颗大炸弹。”六十六师十三旅旅长张洁供认：该部大肆纵火燃烧民房，亦为酿成开封城大火原因之一。
