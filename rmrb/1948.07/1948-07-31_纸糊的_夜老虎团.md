　　Paper-Made "Night Tiger Regiment"
　　Tian Xing, Xing Xing
　　Yan Xishan, afraid of the People's Liberation Army's night battles, specially trained some troops to prepare for night combat. These troops were called the "Night Tiger Regiment." The following is a story about annihilating a Night Tiger Regiment.

　　At 3:00 PM on July 3rd, the People's Liberation Army attacked the city of Qi County. The Yan bandit "Night Tiger Regiment" was in the North Gate. With a cannon blast, the People's Liberation Army soldiers, following the breach opened in the city wall, quickly rushed in. Then, with another blast, they charged into the courtyard. The courtyard was silent. They were surprised: "Why can't we see a single Night Tiger? What do we do if we can't catch any Night Tigers?" So they asked the captured soldier to shout a message. That soldier shouted, "Second Battalion, Eighth Company!" But it was still silent, with no response. "Eighth Company, where is Eighth Company?" the captured soldier shouted again. "Eighth Company is here." Suddenly, someone answered from the bushes fifty meters to their right. Before the words were finished, several People's Liberation Army soldiers pounced over there. The enemy was waiting for their commanding officer, not expecting bayonets already pointed at their chests. "Lay down your weapons and you won't be killed," the People's Liberation Army soldiers shouted. "Lay down our weapons, lay down our weapons," the Eighth Company of the Yan bandit "Night Tiger Regiment" emerged from the bushes one by one like sheep, kneeling on the ground, handing over their guns, begging for mercy. The People's Liberation Army soldiers returned with the newly captured rifles and small cannons, happily saying: "The Night Tigers are actually made of paper!" (Jinzhong Frontline Communication)

　　纸糊的“夜老虎团”
    天星、行型
    阎锡山害怕解放军夜战，专门训练了一些部队准备打夜战，这些部队叫“夜老虎团”，下边就是歼灭夜老虎团的一个故事。
    　七月三日下午三时，人民解放军攻打祁县城，阎匪“夜老虎团”就在北关，一声炮响，人民解放军的战士，随着城墙上打开的缺口，迅速钻了进去，接着，又是一声，他们就冲到院里，院里静悄悄的，他们惊异了：“怎么不见一个夜老虎，捉不住夜老虎怎么办呢？”他们便叫带彩的俘虏喊话。那俘虏喊了一声：“二营八连！”但还是静悄悄的没有回声。“八连，八连在什么地方？”那俘虏又喊了一声。“八连在这里。”忽然在他们右面五十公尺的草丛中有人这样答道。话音未落，几个解放军战士即猛扑过去。敌人正等待着他们的指挥官，不提防刺刀已对准他们的胸脯，“缴枪不杀”，解放军战士呼喊。“缴枪，缴枪，”阎匪“夜老虎团”的第八连一个个从草丛里钻了出来，绵羊似的跪在地上，把枪缴出来，哀求饶命。解放军战士，带着刚缴获的步枪和小炮回来了，高兴的说着：“夜老虎原来是纸糊的！”（晋中前线通讯）
