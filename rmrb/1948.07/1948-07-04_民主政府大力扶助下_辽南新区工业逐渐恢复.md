Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st. Under the strong support of the democratic government, industry in the newly liberated Liaonan area has gradually recovered, and the workers' enthusiasm for production has also increased day by day. A certain textile factory has already put × million spindles into operation in May, and the workers have guaranteed to complete the task of increasing to × million × thousand spindles before July 10th. During the installation process, the workers showed a high degree of enthusiasm. For example, in the puppet Manchukuo era, it took six days to install a spinning machine, but now the same manpower can install it in one and a half days. In the puppet Manchukuo era, a carding machine took seven days to install, but now the same manpower only needs two days. Due to the increase in machines and the expansion of business, the factory added 1,000 new workers in May. In order to help the newly arrived workers settle down, the factory lent out 63,000 jin of grain and 3.2 million yuan. The General Labor Union also cooperated with the factory to organize cooperatives to supply workers with daily necessities at low prices and to organize production for workers' families. Workers in a certain machine factory have launched competition campaigns between work groups and individuals. Worker Nie Zhencai modified the mandrel of the spinning machine, increasing output by 30 percent. When the Liaonan Administrative Office shoe factory was first established in January of this year, each person made an average of two pairs of shoes per day. At the end of April, after streamlining unskilled and idle personnel, each person completed the task of three pairs of shoes per day in May. The output of the day shift of a certain flax spinning factory has exceeded twice the productivity of the puppet Manchukuo era, and three times that of the Chiang occupation period.

　　民主政府大力扶助下
    辽南新区工业逐渐恢复
    【新华社东北一日电】辽南新收复区工业在民主政府大力扶助下已逐渐恢复，工人生产热情亦日益提高。某纺织厂五月份已开动锭子×万枚，工人并保证七月十日前完成增按至×万×千锭子的任务。在按装中，工人都表现了高度的积极性，如伪满时按装一架精纺机需时六天，现在同样的人力一天半即可按好。粗纺机伪满时七天按一架，同样的人力现在只需要两天，该厂因机器增加和业务的扩大，五月份新添工人达一千人。厂方为帮助新来工人安家，借出六万三千斤粮食和三百廿万元。总工会亦协同厂方组织合作社，低价供应工人日用品及组织工人家属生产。某机器工厂工人在各工作组和各人间均互相展开竞赛运动。工友聂振才改造了精纺机锭子的胎，使产量提高百分之三十。辽南行署鞋厂今年一月刚成立时，平均每人每日做鞋两双，四月末精简没有技术的和闲杂人员后，五月份每人每天都完成了三双鞋的任务。某纺麻工厂白日班产量已超过伪满时生产率两倍，蒋占时三倍。
