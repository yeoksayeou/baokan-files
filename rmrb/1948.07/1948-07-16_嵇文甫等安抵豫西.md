Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 14th: Ji Wenfu, head of the History Department of Henan University; Wang Yizhai, former head of the Economics Department and responsible person of the Democratic League in Henan Province; Li Junfu, head of the Chemistry Department and responsible person of the Democratic League in Kaifeng City; writer Su Jinshan; Guo Shouchang, president of the China Times; Liu Guoming, editor-in-chief; and 79 other famous figures from the cultural and educational circles of Kaifeng and their families have safely arrived in a certain area of the liberated area of western Henan. The Western Henan Administrative Office, various organizations and groups in Western Henan, the Western Henan Daily, and the Xinhua Branch Office all sent representatives to welcome them. Ji and the others all expressed great pleasure with this trip. Ji humorously said, "Now let the Kuomintang 'invite' us to 'talk' again!" Ji also praised the correct policies and strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army, saying, "When the People's Liberation Army entered the city on the evening of the 22nd to search for remaining enemies, they knocked lightly on the doors of the common people. Two soldiers came to knock on my door, and my son went out to tell them that students lived there. The two soldiers turned around and left without saying a second word. As soon as the battle ended, some citizens wanted to divide up the spoils, but they were immediately dissuaded by comrades of the People's Liberation Army." Wang Yizhai excitedly said, "In the KMT-controlled area, I was like a small boat in a storm. Now that I have arrived in the liberated area, it is like arriving in a harbor." Ji and the others were extremely indignant about the indiscriminate bombing of Kaifeng by Chiang's planes. They expressed particular grief and indignation at the destruction and casualties suffered by various schools and a large number of students. They said that when Chiang's planes bombed indiscriminately and caused a fire, the Chiang's army locked the students in the houses and did not allow them to escape. When Chiang's planes bombed the Wu Chao Men and Zhongshan Road area on the 20th, many students from Kaifeng Normal School and Kaifeng Women's Normal School were killed and injured, many of whom were burned to death because they were locked in the houses.

　　嵇文甫等安抵豫西
    【新华社中原十四日电】河南大学历史系主任嵇文甫、前经济系主任民主同盟河南省负责人王毅斋、化学系主任民主同盟开封市负责人李俊甫、作家苏金伞、中国时报社长郭寿长、总编辑刘国明等开封文化教育界名流及其家属七十九人，已安抵豫西解放区某地。豫西行政公署、豫西各机关团体，豫西日报社及新华分社皆派代表前往欢迎。嵇氏等对此行皆表十分愉快。嵇氏幽默的说：“现在让国民党再‘请’我们去‘谈话’吧！”嵇氏并盛赞解放军政策正确和纪律严明，他说：“二十二日晚上解放军进城搜索残余敌人时，都是轻轻的敲老百姓的门。有两个战士来叫我家的门，我的儿子出去告诉他们住的是学生，两个战士没有说第二句话就转身走了。战斗刚结束，有几个市民想分东西，都立即被解放军的同志劝止了。”王毅斋兴奋的说：“我在蒋管区就象在暴风雨中的一只小船，现在到了解放区，就象到了港口了。”嵇氏等对蒋机滥炸开封，极为愤慨。对各学校及大批学生遭受毁坏和死伤，尤表悲愤。他们说：当蒋机滥炸并引起大火时，蒋军都把学生关在屋里不准逃出。二十日蒋机轰炸五朝门及中山路一带时，开封师范及开封女师学生死伤很多，其中不少是因被关在屋里而烧死的。
