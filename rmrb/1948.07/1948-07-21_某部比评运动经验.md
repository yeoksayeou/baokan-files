[Frontline News] A certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army recently conducted a comprehensive inspection of the comparison and appraisal movement over twenty days, and summarized four basic experiences:

    First, the comparison and appraisal movement took the new-style military consolidation movement of "Three Check-ups," "Three Rectifications," and "Speaking Bitterness" a step further, making it a collective progress movement on the basis of increased class consciousness. Since the comparison and appraisal movement, the unit's ideological leadership and work style have made considerable progress. The vast majority of cadres have enhanced their political responsibility, can promptly discover and solve problems in their work, focus on their work, and strengthen their concept of cherishing soldiers. A generally widespread hard-working style has been established in the troops, with cadres setting an example, working together with soldiers to overcome difficulties. Policy thinking and discipline have also been greatly strengthened, and violations of policies and discipline have been greatly reduced. The concentrated manifestation of achievements is that righteousness is high in the troops, the atmosphere of learning and the enterprising spirit of revolutionary heroism are gradually rising in the troops, solving some problems that were not solved during the "Three Check-ups" and "Speaking Bitterness," and ensuring and accelerating the smooth completion of various tasks. A large number of comrades were commended for meritorious service in the comparison and appraisal. In a certain unit, more than 400 people were awarded meritorious service in the comparison and appraisal, accounting for 18% of the unit's total number. In a certain combat company, as many as 50% of the people were awarded meritorious service in the comparison and appraisal. Relatively backward comrades have also undergone changes in the collective progress.

    Second, in the revolutionary competition of three comparisons and four comparisons, it is necessary to grasp the three basic principles of seeking truth from facts, being conscious and voluntary, and uniting and helping each other to achieve the goal of common progress, and to oppose forced comparisons and hard comparisons, otherwise, tendencies such as formalism, coercion, individual heroism, and trophy-ism will arise. In the process, emphasize self-comparison (better than the present in the future, better than the past in the present) to realize individual progress plans. And advocate comparisons between units with the same establishment to stimulate the collective progress thinking of each mutually comparing unit and each comrade.

    Third, combine the evaluation of merits and demerits, timely comparison and appraisal, and summarize segment by segment. However, it is necessary to grasp the two principles of democracy and merit-reward education as the main focus to achieve fairness and reasonableness, and clear rewards and punishments. In summarizing the mountain march, a certain company focused on merit-reward education, and after democratic evaluation, summarized the results of comparing two soldiers, and the two soldiers were very satisfied. This also had a good impact on other soldiers. After this summary, the number of people comparing increased from 15 pairs of 30 people to 30 pairs of 60 people, ensuring and accelerating the smooth completion of the company's mountain march task.

    Fourth, in the comparison and appraisal movement, the promotion of new heroism must be combined with serious self-criticism, and encouragement and commendation must be more than criticism, and meritorious service must be more than punishment. Criticism and punishment are aimed at educating and transforming them to consciously participate in the competition for meritorious service. Some units mistakenly regarded self-criticism as a negative thing, and regarded strict discipline as pure punishment, comparing too much about shortcomings and faults, recording too many demerits and punishments, which made everyone feel low and unwilling to compare again. Some units also erroneously opposed multiple commendations and multiple meritorious records to strict self-criticism in promoting revolutionary heroism, making the comrades and units who won meritorious service in the comparison and appraisal proud, complacent, and divorced from the masses. The reason why the heroes, models, and typicals in these units often fail to persevere is this reason.

### 某部比评运动经验

　　某部比评运动经验
    【前线讯】华北解放军某部近对比评运动作了二十天的普遍检查，研究总结出四项基本经验：
    第一、比评运动把“三查”、“三整”、“诉苦”的新式整军运动向前更进了一步，使之成为阶级觉悟提高基础上的集体进步运动。自比评运动以来，该部思想领导与工作作风均有较大进步。极多数干部提高了政治责任心，在工作中能及时发现与解决问题，安心工作，并加强了爱兵观念。部队中相当普遍的树立了艰苦作风，干部以身作则，与战士同策同力，克服困难。政策思想、纪律观念也大大加强，违犯政策、纪律的现象大为减少。成绩的集中表现，是部队中正气昂扬，学习空气与革命英雄主义的进取心在部队中逐步上升，解决了一些“三查”及“诉苦”时都没有解决的问题，保证和加速了各项任务的顺利完成。比评中大批同志立功受奖。某单位在比评中立功者四百余人，占该单位总人数百分之十八。某战斗连比评中立功者竟达百分之五十。较落后的同志在集体进步中也都有了转变。
    第二、在三比、四比的革命竞赛中，必须掌握实事求是、自觉自愿、团结互助三个基本原则，以达到共同进步的目的，反对强比硬比，否则便会产生形式、强迫、个人英雄主义、锦标主义等偏向。在进行中强调自比（今后要比现在好，现在要比过去好），实现个人进步计划。并提倡同一建制的单位比，激发各互比单位及各个同志的集体进步思想。
    第三、结合评功论过，及时比评，逐段总结。但必须掌握民主及功赏教育为主的两个原则，达到公平合理，赏罚严明。某连在总结山地行军中，以功赏教育为主，经过民主评判，总结两个战士相比的结果，这两个战士非常满意，在其它战士中也发生了很好的影响，这次总结后，比的人数由十五对三十人增到三十对六十人，保证和加速了这个连队山地行军任务的顺利完成。
    第四、在比评运动中发扬新英雄主义，必须与严肃的自我批评相结合，鼓励表扬必须多于批评，立功必须多于惩罚，批评与惩罚又是以教育改造使其自觉参加竞赛立功为目的。某些单位错误的把自我批评当做消极的东西，把严格纪律当成单纯的惩罚，过多的比缺点、比过失，多记过、多惩罚，弄得大家情绪不高，不愿再比。也有某些单位在发扬革命英雄主义中，把多表扬、多记功，错误的与严格自我批评对立起来，使得比评中立功获胜的同志与单位骄傲自满，脱离群众。这些单位中的功臣、模范、典型常常坚持不下来，就是这个原因。
