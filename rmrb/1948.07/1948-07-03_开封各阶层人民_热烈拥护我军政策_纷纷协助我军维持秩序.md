Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 2nd: The people of all social strata in Kaifeng warmly support the People's Liberation Army's various democratic policies and decrees, and are automatically cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to maintain social order. The day after Kaifeng was liberated (the 24th), more than 30 industrialists and businessmen in the city gathered to discuss how to quickly resume business. At the meeting, representatives of the People's Liberation Army explained the CCP's industrial and commercial policies of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and management, which were unanimously supported by the participants. The next day, large and small shops in Gulou Street, Madao Street, and Bookstore Street in the central area of the city successively began business. On the 25th, the people of Nanguan also automatically contacted the People's Liberation Army to assist in maintaining order in Nanguan. The People's Liberation Army's call for personnel from various public institutions, public banks, and enterprises to return to their original positions, work with peace of mind, and await instructions, was met with enthusiastic response. On the 24th, more than ten employees of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications returned to their respective banks and contacted the People's Liberation Army personnel to continue their service. The post office, which was set on fire and destroyed by the Chiang bandits, also had its employees send representatives to request the People's Liberation Army to designate a new location to resume operations. The Yellow River Conservancy Engineering Bureau suffered damage from the Chiang bandits during the battle, and the bureau's personnel requested protection, which the People's Liberation Army resolved one by one. The joint enrollment advertisements of various universities in the liberated areas within Kaifeng City aroused the yearning of a large number of young men and women. The two rooms of the enrollment registration office were crowded with people requesting to take the exams. By the 24th, more than 270 people had registered and had already set off to study at various universities in the liberated areas.
