Small Stories of Eliminating the "Pro-Training Teachers"

(I) The artillery fire had already disrupted the marching order of the pro-training teachers. Combat team leader Qiao Lianke led Qin Yulin and Wang Changfa in charging towards the enemy at the forefront. Three enemies rushed towards Lianke with bayonets. Lianke first stabbed and killed the first enemy in front. At this moment, the second enemy's bayonet had already injured Comrade Qiao Lianke's head, but he immediately turned his gun and shot down the second enemy. Seeing the situation was bad, the third enemy was about to turn tail and run when he was shot down by another shot. At this time, Comrades Wang Changxu and Qin Yulin caught up and annihilated all the enemies who rushed over. At the end of the battle, they seized two pistols and six rifles. Although Qiao Lianke was injured, he carried two guns and a telephone set back victoriously.

(II) In the battle to eliminate the pro-training teachers, the sixth squad of the seventh company was tasked with attacking the enemy. The warriors of the sixth squad rushed towards the enemy with swift and courageous combat actions. Second Platoon Leader and Wang Shengde, a disabled soldier of the sixth squad with only one arm, threw two hand grenades at the enemy crowd, scaring more than a hundred enemies into not daring to move. The deputy leader of the second platoon rushed forward fearlessly and took a machine gun from the enemy. Holding an unlit hand grenade in his left hand, he shouted: Brothers, those who surrender will not be killed, come over and we are one family. Comrade Wang Shengde also went up and seized five rifles from the enemy. At this time, the enemies, terrified out of their wits, quickly kowtowed and said: We surrender, we surrender. The deputy leader of the second platoon wanted to continue the pursuit mission, so he had Wang Shengde guard these prisoners with a machine gun. More than ten minutes later, the follow-up troops arrived, and Wang Shengde carried five rifles and two walkie-talkies to follow the troops.

(III) The bandits of Yan's pro-training teachers were scattered by our brave and ferocious People's Liberation Army. A group of bandits of about a hundred people drilled around everywhere, running west when attacked from the east, and running east when attacked from the west. It happened to run to the aid station of the second company of our sixth detachment. Comrade Yao Taibao, the deputy political instructor of the sixth company, was unarmed at the time, but this was meat delivered to his mouth, so he couldn't miss the opportunity. He picked up a colored signal gun and shouted that those who surrender would not be killed. The enemy saw that he was alone and refused to surrender. Comrade Taibao became angry and shot one enemy dead. At this time, Huang Xingcai and three other comrades also arrived. The enemy became frightened and respectfully surrendered their weapons, capturing a total of fifty-six enemies, seizing two small cannons, one heavy machine gun, one light machine gun, six rifles, and one eight-tone box.

    （一）炮火已经把亲训师的行军序列打乱了，战斗小组长乔连科带着秦玉林、王昌发在最前边向敌展开冲锋，迎面三个敌人端着刺刀向连科扑来，连科便先将前边第一个敌人刺死，这时，第二个敌人的刺刀已刺伤乔连科同志的脑部，但他一下扭转枪口，就把第二个敌人打倒了。第三个敌人见势不妙，正想调转屁股逃命时，被他又一枪也干倒了。这时王昌许、秦玉林两同志赶上来又把冲过来的一股敌人全部歼灭，战斗结束时，他们组织获了手枪两支，步枪六支。乔连科虽然负伤，还扛着两支枪一架电话机子胜利而归。

    （三）阎匪亲训师的匪徒们，被我勇猛如虎的解放军冲得七零八散了，一股匪徒约百余人到处乱钻，东面打来住西面跑，西面打来又往东面窜，恰巧窜到我六分队二中队的救护所，六连副政指姚太保同志，当时手无寸铁，但是这是送到嘴边的肉，可不能错过机会，就随手拿起彩号的一支枪，喊着缴枪不杀，敌人见他是一个人，就不缴枪，太保同志愤怒了，“叭”的一枪一个敌人送了命，这时黄兴才等三个同志也赶来了，敌人害了怕，就恭恭敬敬地缴了枪，共俘敌五十六名，缴小炮两门，重机枪一挺，轻机枪一挺，步枪六支，八音一支。
