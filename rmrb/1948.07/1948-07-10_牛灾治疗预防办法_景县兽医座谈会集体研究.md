[Hebei South News] Many villages in Jing County have experienced cattle plagues. The county government convened a county-wide veterinary symposium on June 11 to study methods for treating and preventing cattle plagues. After three days of discussion, it was generally agreed that the main causes of cattle plagues were dry weather, malnutrition, and drinking cold water immediately after work, which would trap heat inside, leading to a damp-heat syndrome that would then develop into dysentery, making treatment difficult. Based on this etiology and practical treatment experience, the following treatment and prevention methods for cattle plagues are proposed:

(1) Symptoms and Treatment of Cattle Plague

1.  Mental fatigue, ruffled hair on the front half of the body, sunken waist, dry stool, and dry omasum.
    Treatment: Eight qian of tangerine peel, eight qian of green tangerine peel, one liang of Eucommia ulmoides fruit, two and a half qian of rhubarb, four qian of hemp seed, nine qian of betel nut, six qian of Akebia trifoliata, seven qian of Scutellaria baicalensis, and ten liang of lard as an excipient, all ground into fine powder and administered orally.

2.  Mental fatigue, looking back at the abdomen, loose stool, false heat in the front part of the body, and damp heat in the rear part.
    Treatment: Two and a half liang of Atractylodes lancea soaked in rice water, two and a half liang of Aconitum carmichaelii roasted in white bread, one liang of apricot kernels, two liang of rhubarb (half fried), one liang of licorice root fried with alkaline soil, all ground into fine powder and administered orally three times with rice soup.
