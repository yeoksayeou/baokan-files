Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. TASS, Paris: L'Humanité, organ of the French Communist Party, published an article on June 28th denouncing the Franco-American bilateral agreement, stating that this agreement would make France an appendage of American millionaires, with the aim of destroying French industry, commerce and agriculture. It paves the way for the legalization of American spies and the subjection of France and its territories to the United States. If the Council of Ministers (i.e., the French government) were to approve this agreement, it would bear the historical responsibility similar to consenting to participate in the Marshall Plan, the Brussels Five-Power Military Alliance, and approving the London Agreement, which made France an appendage of the United States. L'Humanité pointed out that the terms of the agreement endanger our financial system and effectively allow the United States to freely dispose of French resources. The Economic Research Department of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), in its communiqué published on the 26th, in addition to exposing the criminal clauses of the Franco-American bilateral agreement, also lodged a solemn protest, saying: The CGT protests against this policy aimed at depriving France of its sovereignty and independence.

　　法美协定毁灭法国工商农业将使法国成为美国富翁附庸         
    法共人道报抨击法美双边协定
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法共机关报人道报于六月二十八日发表抨击法美双边协定的论文称：这一协定将使法国成为美国富翁的附庸，其目的则是在毁灭法国的工商业和农业。它为美国间谍的合法化以及使法国和法国的属地受制于美国铺平道路。部长会议（即法国政府）要批准这一协定，它就将担负类似同意参加马歇尔计划，布鲁塞尔五国军事同盟，以及批准使法国成为美国附庸的伦敦协议的历史性责任。人道报指出，协定的条款，危及我们的财政系统，并且实际上使美国自由处理法国的资源。法国总工会经济研究处在其二十六日发表的公报中，除揭露法美双边协定的罪恶条款以外，并提出郑重的抗议说：总工会抗议这种目的在剥夺法国主权与独立的政策。
