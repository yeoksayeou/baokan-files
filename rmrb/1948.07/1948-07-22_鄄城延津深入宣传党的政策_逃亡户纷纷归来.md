(Jilu Yu News) In the past two or three months, various parts of Jilu Yu have corrected left-leaning deviations, rectified policies, and widely publicized our Party's land policy and production policy in practical work. Some middle peasants, landlords, and rich peasants who had fled to other villages in the past have returned one after another. Juancheng launched a publicity campaign in early April, using markets, various gatherings, and individual conversations to explain policies. As of now, 900 people, including former puppet soldiers and fugitive households, have returned. After returning home, landlord Lü Qinxiu from Lü Miao made a self-criticism to the masses, saying that he should not have fled, and the Farmers' Association provided him with good resettlement. After landlord Li Mengtang from Lizhuang returned home, the masses also distributed land to him and resettled him. Yanjin is a marginal area in the southwest of the Fourth District. During the extensive re-examination movement last summer, it committed serious errors of left-leaning adventurism. Some landlords, rich peasants, and some middle peasants who did not understand the policies fled. Since the implementation of production and disaster relief in April, fugitive households have gradually recognized our Party's policies and have returned home one after another. Thirteen fugitive households have returned to Xichen Village in the county, and all have received appropriate compensation and resettlement, obtaining the same amount of land as the masses. Rich peasant Zhao Jian'san is a doctor. His pharmacy was confiscated during the land reform. After he returned, all the tools of the pharmacy were returned to him, and a sum of cash was loaned to him to help him purchase medicinal materials and open for business.

(Another dispatch) After Taixi recovered large areas, it held mass meetings, puppet family meetings, and individual propaganda to explain our Party's land policy and lenient policy, dispelling the concerns of puppet families, who called on their husbands, sons, relatives, and friends to return home. After the head of Dayu Village, Fifth District, held a meeting, he called back 21 members of the security team. From May 30th to June 15th, in half a month, the entire county persuaded a total of 625 people to return, bringing with them six machine guns, 175 rifles, more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and four telephones.

　　鄄城延津深入宣传党的政策
  　逃亡户纷纷归来
    【冀鲁豫讯】冀鲁豫各地两三个月以来，在实际工作中，做到了纠正左偏，端正政策，广泛宣传我党土地政策及生产政策，过去逃亡外乡的某些中农及地主富农纷纷归来。鄄城自四月初展开宣传运动，利用集市、各种集会和个别谈话等方式讲解政策，截至目前，已有伪军人员及逃亡户九百人归来。吕庙地主吕钦修回家后，向群众检讨过去不该外逃，农会很好的安置了他。李庄地主李梦堂回家后，群众也给他分了地，安置了他。延津为四分区西南部的边沿区，去夏大复查运动中，犯了严重的左倾冒险主义错误。有些地主富农和一部分不了解政策的中农逃亡了。自四月份进行生产救灾以来，逃亡户逐渐认识我党政策，陆续回家。该县西陈村逃亡户已回来十三户，均得到适当补偿和安置，获得和群众同样数量的土地。富农赵建三是个医生，土改中把他的药铺没收了，他回来后，药铺的一切工具都还了他，并贷给一部现款，帮助他置买药材开张营业。
    【又讯】泰西收复大块地区后，召开群众会、伪属会及个别宣传，讲解我党土地政策及宽大政策，解除了伪属顾虑，纷纷叫丈夫、儿子、亲友回家。五区大虞村保长开罢会，就叫回保队人员二十一名。由五月三十日起、到六月十五日止，半月中全县共争取回来六百二十五人，带来机枪六挺，长短枪一百七十五支，子弹一万余发，电话机四部。
