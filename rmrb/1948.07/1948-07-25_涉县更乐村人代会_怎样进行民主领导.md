The People's Congress of Gengle Village, Shexian County
How to Conduct Democratic Leadership
	Wang Chaojin
	The People's Congress of Gengle Village, Shexian County, was established in January of this year. Over the past few months, it has established a system of democratic centralism and implemented a new style of leadership, achieving preliminary results and experience. The following is an introduction:
	1. Everyone Cares About the People's Congress
	Major issues concerning all strata of the village's population must be discussed and resolved by the People's Congress before they can be implemented. The resolutions of each People's Congress are of great concern to the masses of all strata. During the rectification campaign, poor peasants paid close attention to how the People's Congress would decide on compensating middle peasants who had been wrongly labeled, whether they would have to return the fruits entirely from their own pockets, or whether other methods would be considered. When re-examining and correcting class designations, many households that had been struggled against sought out middle and poor peasant representatives with whom they had connections, asking, "You must bring it up at the People's Congress, no matter what. My class status really doesn't qualify me as a landlord or rich peasant." When allocating land, middle peasant Zhang Fubang told the representative in his alley, "I don't know how the People's Congress will decide on the land allocation method! Will it involve moving middle peasant land? When you representatives go to the meeting, suggest to everyone that we shouldn't use the old rigid method of dividing it equally based on the number of people in each household and whether they have enough grain and land. This time, it should be more flexible, and taking land should be truly voluntary." On issues such as resolving production difficulties, issuing loans, providing relief from spring famine, rectifying corvée labor, substitute cultivation, and organizing rectification mutual aid teams, the masses of all strata had many opinions, asking representatives to bring them up for discussion at the People's Congress. The resolutions of the People's Congress are based on policies and the opinions of the masses, and are made through everyone's discussion, so the masses implement them very conscientiously. They said, "The People's Congress is truly a place where we, the masses, are the masters," and "Many of the resolutions made by the People's Congress are the same as what we were thinking." Village cadres feel that they have a basis to rely on when dealing with problems. They said, "For all the major issues in the village concerning all strata of the population, we convene a representative meeting for democratic consultation, and the resolutions made must be followed. We just handle problems based on the resolutions, which is much more thorough than having just a few cadres decide on the problems. It's true that with more people, there are more ideas, and everything can be taken care of. It's much easier for us to handle. We don't need to order the masses; the masses themselves implement their own resolutions. We just need to take the lead and guide them."
	2. How Does the People's Congress Conduct Correct Democratic Leadership?
	The People's Congress should not be convened lightly. Only when there are principled and universal issues affecting the entire village should the representative meeting be convened for discussion and resolution, which is then handed over to the village government for implementation. Daily individual problems are resolved by the village government, which reports to the People's Congress periodically.
	Before convening the People's Congress, the Party branch first convenes a meeting to discuss major issues arising among the masses and the tasks for each period, making resolutions that the branch committee suggests to the presidium of the People's Congress. After accepting the suggestions, the presidium then discusses how to convene the representative meeting in light of the actual situation in the village, what issues need to be resolved, and how to resolve these issues, making preliminary plans. The agricultural association committee members and People's Congress representatives then carry out activities among the agricultural association members and the masses, soliciting opinions from the masses, listening to the voices of the masses, and convening agricultural association groups for extensive deliberation, so that the representatives can collect the opinions of the broad masses and bring them to the representative meeting for discussion. If the presidium of the People's Congress does not accept the branch's suggestions, all Party members must implement the decisions of the People's Congress and must not engage in coercion or divisive actions, but may continue to strive to persuade the masses to agree.
	When the People's Congress is formally convened, the presidium reports to all the representatives on the implementation of the resolutions of the previous People's Congress, and proposes the issues that need to be resolved by this representative meeting. The village government also reports on the work of the government to the representative meeting. All the representatives deliberate and discuss in groups based on alleys, and then convene a general meeting to review the implementation of the resolutions of the previous People's Congress and the work of the government, and to discuss the principles and methods for resolving the newly raised issues. After debate, a resolution is made, and finally it is voted on and passed.
	During the representatives' discussion, democracy is fully promoted. There are criticisms and debates; sometimes the opinions of the poor peasant representatives and the middle peasant representatives are inconsistent, and sometimes the opinions of the Party member representatives and the mass representatives are inconsistent, but everyone is allowed to state their reasons. The leadership encourages correct opinions based on the spirit of the policies, explains the advantages and disadvantages, gradually opens up thinking, and finally uses the principle of the minority submitting to the majority to vote and pass a formal resolution.
	After the People's Congress adjourns, the presidium is responsible for promoting and inspecting the implementation of the People's Congress resolutions by the village government and the masses, studying whether the resolutions themselves are correct, what the reactions are among the masses, and accepting temporary opinions and issues raised by the masses. When it is not necessary to convene a representative meeting, the presidium convenes a meeting to make temporary resolutions and hand them over to the village government for implementation, but must report to the next representative meeting to obtain ratification.
	After the People's Congress adjourns, the representatives are responsible for conveying the resolutions in an organized manner. They also use various methods such as writing, mass blackboards, radio stations, and oral publicity to inform the masses of the entire village so that the masses can discuss and consciously implement them. Party members and cadres use various opportunities to explain the People's Congress resolutions to the masses and widely collect opinions from the masses. If there are inappropriate parts of the resolutions, or if the majority of the masses are dissatisfied, they are promptly reported to the presidium of the People's Congress for research and discussion, or the People's Congress is convened again to discuss and revise them.
	Each representative meeting reviews the presidium's and the village government's reports on the implementation of the resolutions, makes criticisms of those that have not been implemented, and makes commendations and criticisms of the village cadres. At the Fifth People's Congress, the representatives criticized Wang Donglin, the chairman of the alley agricultural association, for being irresponsible in his work, only finding it troublesome when the masses asked him to solve problems. He also made a personal self-criticism, and now he is very responsible in his work. He said, "I must do my work well, otherwise, how can I be worthy of the masses?" At each representative meeting, the implementation of the People's Congress resolutions and the work of the village government must be reviewed.
	In the implementation of the People's Congress resolutions, we often encounter individual extremely bad democratic elements who have no regard for discipline and defy the People's Congress resolutions without good reason. The village government puts forward criticisms of these people and orders them to implement the resolutions.

　　涉县更乐村人代会
  　怎样进行民主领导
    王朝进
    涉县更乐村人民代表会是今年一月成立的。几个月来，建立民主集中制，实行新的领导作风，获得初步成绩与经验，现介绍于下：
    一、人人关心人代会
    有关全村各阶层群众的大事，都要经过人民代表会讨论，作出决议才能执行。每次人代会的决议，各阶层群众都很关心。在纠偏时，贫农很注意人代会怎样决定补偿错斗中农，是不是要完全从自己身上往出退果实，还是另外想些办法。在重新审查订正成份时，许多被斗户找与他们有联系的中贫农代表，要求“你去代表会无论如何给咱提一下，我的成份实在够不上地主富农。”在抽补土地时，中农张福邦给他同巷的代表说：“不知道人代会怎么决定抽补办法呀！是不是要动中农土地？你们代表去开会时，给大家提个意见，不要象以前按每户人数、粮齐地齐的死办法打乱平分。这次应活便一些，拿地要让大家真正自愿。”在解决生产困难、发放贷款、救济春荒、整顿差务、代耕、组织整顿互助组等问题上，各阶层群众都有许多意见，要求代表替自己提到人代会去讨论。人代会的决议是根据政策与群众的意见经过大家讨论做出来的，群众都很认真执行。他们说：“人代会真是咱群众当家做主的地方”，“人代会作的决议有许多与咱想的意见是一个样”。村干部处理问题，这时感到有了依靠。他们说：“全村有关各阶层群众的大事，召开代表会民主商讨，作出决议都得照办，咱就根据决议处理问题，这比过去几个干部决定问题周到得多。真是人多意见广，处处都能照顾到，咱这就好办的多了。不用咱去命令群众，群众自己去执行自己的决议，咱只带头领领就行了。”
    二、人代会怎样进行正确的民主领导？
    人代会不能轻易召开。全村带有原则性的、普遍性的问题，才召开代表会讨论。作出解决问题的决议，交村政府执行。日常的个别的问题，则由村政府解决，并定期向人代会做报告。
    在开人代会之前，党的支部即召开会议，讨论群众中发生的重大问题，与各时期的工作任务，作出决议，由支委会建议人代会主席团，主席团接受建议后，即结合村中实际情况讨论代表会如何召开，要解决那些问题，及如何解决这些问题，作出初步方案，由农会委员、人代会代表分别在农会会员中及群众中活动，征求群众意见，倾听群众呼声，召开农会小组广泛酝酿，使代表能收集广大群众的意见带到代表会上讨论，如果人代会主席团不接受支部建议时，支部党员皆须执行人代会决定，不得有强迫或分裂行动，但可继续争取说服群众同意。
    正式召开人代会时，主席团向全体代表报告前届人代会决议执行情况，提出这次代表会需要解决的问题。村政府也向代表会报告政府工作。全体代表以巷为单位，分小组酝酿讨论，然后召开大会，检查前届人代会决议的执行情形与政府的工作，讨论解决新提问题的原则与办法。经过争论作出决议，最后表决通过。
    在代表讨论中，充分发扬民主。有批评有争论；有时贫农代表与中农代表意见不一致，有时党员代表与群众代表意见不一致，但允许各说各的理由。领导上以政策的精神鼓励正确的意见，说明厉害，逐步打通思想，最后用少数服从多数的原则表决通过，作出正式决议。
    人代会闭会后，主席团负责推动检查村政府与群众对人代会决议的执行，研究决议本身正确与否，在群众中有何反映，接受群众临时性的意见及提出的问题。不需召开代表会时，即召开主席团会议，作出临时决议，交村政府执行，但须向下届代表会作报告，取得追认。
    人代会闭会后，代表负责把决议有组织的传达下去。并用文字、大众黑板、广播台、口头宣传等各种方式，告给全村群众，让群众讨论自觉执行。党员、干部运用各种机会向群众讲解人代会决议，广泛搜集群众意见。如决议有不妥当处，或大多数群众不满意，就及时反映给人代会主席团研究讨论，或召开人代会重新讨论修改。
    每次代表会都检查主席团与村政府所作决议执行情况的报告，对执行不到的提出批评，对村干部提出表扬和批评。在第五次人代会上，代表批评巷农会主席王东林工作不负责，群众找他解决问题只嫌麻烦，他个人也作了检讨，现在工作很负责。他说：“工作可得好好干才行，不然，怎能对得起群众？”在每次代表会上，要检查人代会决议执行与村政府工作。
    在执行人代会决议中，常遇到个别目无纪律的极坏民主分子，无正当理由，违抗人代会决议。村政府对这些人即提出批评意见，令其执行。
