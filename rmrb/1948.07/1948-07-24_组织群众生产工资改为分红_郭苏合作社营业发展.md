　　Organizing Mass Production by Changing Wages to Dividends
　　Guo Su Cooperative's Business Development

　　[North Yue News] The Pingshan Guo Su Town People's Cooperative was established in March 1947. It was organized by Comrade Han Shaobai, the current head of the Industrial Section of the North Yue Fourth Special District Office, at the request of the masses. Initially, more than ninety shareholders voluntarily raised 2,687,000 yuan (border currency, same below). Later, with substantial investment and support from public stores and other sources, the capital grew to 44,940,000 yuan. Gradually, it developed to employ twenty-six workers and nine cadres and purchasing agents. The cooperative has agricultural tools, blacksmithing, felt-making, sheep-raising, ironware, and dyeing sections.

　　The People's Cooperative has broken out of the circle of ordinary stores. In fourteen months, it manufactured 858 items such as single-wheeled carts, bellows, spinning wheels, and harrows; more than 4,200 pieces of ironware such as pot lids, hoes, sickles, iron shovels, kitchen knives, and weaving knives; felted 1,178 pieces of felt; and made 11,372.5 jin of hemp rope, but it still could not meet the demand. The masses are willing to "patronize" the People's Cooperative, mainly because the materials are good and the prices are low. The prices of the People's Cooperative are generally 10 to 20 percent lower than market prices. Purchasing raw materials from afar is naturally one of the reasons for the low prices; but without the business philosophy of Director Han Qingming, who said, "We don't seek anything else, only to solve the difficulties of the masses," it would not be possible. The People's Cooperative not only produces itself, but also promotes household sideline production and organ production. The hemp rope section organized 18 households to spin hemp in batches of more than 5,400 jin, earning wages of 4,996,000 yuan. A portion of the shares were used to collect sheep, and a sheep-raising section was established. In fourteen months, the sheep fertilized 229 mu of land in nearby villages. The fertilization was free, only requiring feeding. Since its establishment, the cooperative's total turnover has been 618,930,000 yuan, with a total profit of more than 86,060,000 yuan, accounting for 13.8 percent of the turnover.

　　The development of the People's Cooperative was not smooth sailing in the past nine or ten months. It went from failure to success. The key lies in "changing the wage system to a dividend system." At the beginning of its establishment, the cooperative used a "guaranteed wage" system for workers. Skilled workers earned 100 to 120 jin of millet per month, and semi-skilled workers earned 70 jin. Food and clothing were provided by the cooperative. Although it was said at the time that "if the cooperative earns more, there will be additional dividends," the workers lost confidence in the cooperative's ability to make money because they emphasized that the prices should be lower than those of private businesses. The "guaranteed wage" system actually became a "wage system." The workers believed that the wages were the same whether they worked hard or not, so they were unwilling to work hard. It usually took eight workdays to make a single-wheeled cart, but they would take nine or even ten workdays. Some of the bellows made were completely immovable, and some could not be pushed back after being pulled out. Zhao Laozi of the agricultural tools section had better skills, but he complained that 120 jin of rice was too little, and he argued with the cooperative and made strange remarks: "The cooperative is for the people, not for making money, so we'll just wait to work for nothing!" He brought his wife and children to the cooperative, and they stayed for ten or twenty days at a time. The masses reflected: "The price is not high, but the goods are not good." Therefore, the cooperative almost collapsed. Xu Tingzhang invested two shi of rice and wheat, and requested "give me half in kind and be done with it." Based on the above situation, after joint research by the cooperative's cadres and Comrade Han Shaobai, they found that the reason for the workers' low morale was the guaranteed wage issue, and they immediately convened everyone for review and discussion. At the meeting, some said: "Working like this, we can't even withstand one-third of the effort. We're watching and working, but we're not putting in the effort." Some said: "We don't earn more by working harder, so there's no motivation." Finally, everyone unanimously agreed to change to a dividend system. All profits: skilled workers receive 40 percent (the dividend ratio between skilled and semi-skilled workers is two to one), and the remaining 60 percent is the total profit. Cadres are all on a supply system and are paid from the total profit. Another 15 percent of the total profit is allocated to the public welfare fund. In this way, everyone's morale was high. Only Zhao Kaozi still believed that "selling too cheaply doesn't make money." Under his influence, four workers in the agricultural tools section voluntarily left the cooperative. However, through hard work, the number of workers slowly increased. A cart now only takes seven workdays; the materials that used to make three cart handles can now make four. Han Jiji of the blacksmithing section and Zhang Ruyi of the hemp rope section, as well as Jia Menghu and You Shangwu of the agricultural tools section, all voluntarily processed more when there was a lot of work. Han Jiji, the blacksmith, used to earn 100 jin of millet per month. In the second five-month period, he received a dividend of 996,100 yuan, which was equivalent to more than 660 jin of rice at that time. Zhang Ruyi of the hemp rope section received a dividend of 1,550,000 yuan in the third five-month period, equivalent to 620 jin of rice. The workers' incomes increased, and in addition, a study system was established (reading newspapers and learning to read for one hour every night). The cadres also took time to plant half a mu of vegetable garden, which improved the food. Everyone's morale was very high, and the four people who left the cooperative wanted to come back. Shu Shu said: "We can work and understand national affairs, which is better than working for private individuals." The masses came to inquire whether they could invest shares. Currently, the agricultural tools section and the blacksmithing section of the cooperative are preparing to expand. Only the dyeing workshop was cancelled in the end because the technology was not strong, the masses were not satisfied, and there were already two or three dyeing workshops in the town.

　　组织群众生产工资改为分红
  　郭苏合作社营业发展
    【北岳讯】平山郭苏镇人民合作社成立于一九四七年三月，是现任北岳四专署实业科长韩少白同志在群众要求下组织起来的。开始由九十多个股东自愿集资二百六十八万七千元（边币，下同），后经公营商店等大量投资扶植，资金发展到四千四百九十四万。逐渐发展工人二十六人，干部、采买等九人；合作社设有农具、铁匠、毡坊、养羊、铁货、染坊等股。
    人民合作社跳出了一般商店性质的圈子。十四个月来，制造了单轮小车、风箱、纺车、耠子等八百五十八件；锅头、锄、镰、铁锹、菜刀、织布刀等铁货四千二百余件；赶毡一千一百七十八条；打麻绳一万一千三百七十二斤半，但仍供不应求。群众愿意“照顾”人民合作社，主要原因是材料好，价钱少。人民合作社的物价，一般低于市价百分之十至二十。采购原料走的远，自然是物价低的原因之一；但如果没有主任韩庆明所说：“不图别的，只为给群众解决困难”的经营方针，也不可能。人民合作社不但自己生产，还带动家庭副业与机关生产。麻绳股组织群众十八家纺麻批五千四百余斤，赚工资四百九十九万六千元。股金内集了一部分羊，设了养羊股，十四个月卧地，解决了附近村二百二十九亩地的肥料，卧地不要钱，只吃饭。该社成立以来，总营业额六亿一千八百九十三万元，共得红利八千六百零六万余，占营业额的百分之十三点八。
    人民合作社的发展过去用九个、十个工作，并不是一帆风顺的，它是从挫败走上成功。关键在“改工资制为分红制”。该社成立之初，对工人是用“保证金”制。每月技术工人赚小米一百至一百二十斤，半技术工人七十斤，吃穿由社内供给，虽然当时也说“社里多赚了，另外还要分红”，但因当时强调了货价要比私人低，工人对社里赚钱便没了信心。“保证金”制实际上成了“工资制”。工人们认为干好干坏工资是一样多，因此不肯好好干。打一个单轮车，一般需要八个工，他们就得九个甚至十个工。做出的风箱，有的根本拉不动，有的拉出来又推不回去。农具股赵老子技术较好，但嫌一百二十斤米少，和社里闹意见、说怪话：“社里是为人民，不为赚钱，咱就等着白干吧！”把老婆孩子接到社里，一住就是一二十天。群众反映：“价钱不大，就是货不好。”因此该社几乎垮了台。许亭章入了两石米麦的股，要求“按实物给我一半完事”。根据以上情形，经社里干部与韩少白同志共同研究，找到了工人情绪不高的原因在保证金问题上，随即召集大家检讨研究。会上有的说：“这样做工三下也顶不住一下。看着也干哩，就是不使劲”。有的说：“多干不多赚，干着没有劲”。最后一致同意改为分红制。全部红利，技工分百分之四十（技工与半技工分红为二比一），其余百分之六十为总红利。干部均为供给制，从总红利中开支。另在总红利中抽百分之十五公益金。这样，大家情绪都高了。只有赵考子仍认为“卖贱了不赚钱”，在他影响下，农具股的四个工人自愿出了社。但经努力经营，工人就慢慢加多了，一辆小车，现在只用七个工；过去三辆车把的材料，现在能作四辆。铁匠股与麻绳股全体，农具股的贾猛虎、尤尚武，都在活多时自动加工。铁匠韩吉吉过去月赚小米百斤，第二期五个月分红九十九万六千一百元，当时折米六百六十多斤。麻绳股张如一第三期五个月分红一百五十五万，折米六百二十斤。工人们收入增多，再加上建立了学习制度（每晚读报、识字一小时），干部又抽暇种了半亩菜园地，改善了伙食，大家情绪很高，出社的四个人又想回来。书书说：“作了活又能明白国家大事，比给私人干强”。群众纷纷来询问是否吸收股金。现该社农具股、铁匠股都准备扩大。只有染坊因技术不强，群众不满意，同时本镇已有两三家染坊，所以最后取消了。
