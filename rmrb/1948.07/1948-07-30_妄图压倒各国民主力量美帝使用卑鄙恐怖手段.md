　　U.S. Imperialism Resorts to Despicable Terrorist Tactics in a Futile Attempt to Suppress Democratic Forces in Various Countries

In Italy, Japan, and the United States, a series of conspiracies to assassinate or arrest prominent Communist leaders have occurred recently. On the 14th, there was a shooting of Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti; on the 19th, Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Tokuda Kyuichi was injured in a bombing; and on the 20th, the U.S. government arrested seven Communist leaders. The Czech government also announced on the 17th that it had uncovered a foreign spy's assassination plot. International democratic public opinion believes that all these conspiracies and terrorist incidents, whether occurring in the United States or other countries, are instigated by U.S. imperialist elements. U.S. Communist leaders Foster and Dennis, in their telegram to the Italian Communist Party, said that the assassination in Rome was the result of American policy, and in their telegram to the Japanese Communist Party, they pointed out that U.S. imperialism was the real instigator of the crime against Tokuda. In addition, according to leaks from American magazines, American reactionaries have a so-called "Bridge Project" engaged in espionage in various countries, and its projects include "assassinating the lives of Communist leaders." This heinous conspiracy of the U.S., Italian, and Japanese reactionaries has aroused great indignation among the people of those countries. In particular, the protest against the assassination of Togliatti has turned into a mass movement of worldwide condemnation of the reactionaries.

Other more important international events recently include: (1) The French Schuman government fell on the 19th; French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez called for the establishment of a truly French government at a mass rally in Paris on the 16th; the strike of French government employees has expanded to 1.5 million people on the 13th, and workers from unions affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor, "Workers' Force," and the Christian Workers' League have formed a mass united front in the struggle for wage increases. (2) The World Peace Conference organized by the British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, opened in London on the 17th. (3) The Greek Democratic Army once again defeated the fascist army's offensive in the northern region of the Pindus Mountains. (4) The U.S. Democratic Party held its convention in Philadelphia from the 12th to the 14th, passing essentially the same reactionary domestic and foreign policy platforms as the Republican Party, and nominated Truman and Senator Barkley as the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates this year; Truman has decided to convene a special Congress on July 26th. (5) Leaders of political parties and public organizations from both North and South Korea held a second joint conference in Pyongyang, deciding to establish a Korean Supreme People's Assembly elected by elections and a unified Korean government composed of representatives from North and South Korea.

　　妄图压倒各国民主力量美帝使用卑鄙恐怖手段
    在意日美诸国，最近时期接连发生了阴谋暗杀或逮捕著名共产党领袖的事件。十四日发生了枪击意共总书记托格里亚蒂的事件；十九日发生了炸伤日共总书记德田球一的事件；二十日发生了美国政府逮捕共产党领袖七人的事件。捷克政府亦于十七日宣布破获外国间谍的谋杀案。国际民主舆论相信：所有这些阴谋恐怖事件，无论是发生于美国或其他国家，均出于美帝国主义分子的策动。美共领袖福斯特和但尼斯在其致意共电中说罗马的暗杀是美国政策的结果，在其致日共电中则指明美帝国主义是对德田罪行的真正唆使者。此外，据美国杂志泄露，美国反动派有一个在各国从事间谍工作的所谓“布里奇计划”，其计划的项目中即包括“谋刺共产党领袖的生命”。美意日反动派的这种万恶阴谋，已激起各该国人民的巨大义愤，特别是对行刺托格里亚蒂事件的抗议，已变成一个世界性的声讨反动派的群众运动。
    最近时期国际上的其他较重要事件有：（一）法国舒曼政府已于十九日倒台；法共总书记多列士于十六日在巴黎的群众大会上号召建立真正法国人的政府；法国政府雇员的罢工，十三日已扩大为一百五十万人，总工会、“工人力量”与基督教工人联盟所属工会的工人，已在斗争中结成了群众性的要求增资的统一战线。（二）英共机关报工人日报所组织的世界和平会议，十七日在伦敦开幕。（三）希腊民主军在平都斯山北部地区再次击溃法西斯军的进攻。（四）美国民主党大会已于十二日至十四日在费城举行，通过了基本上和共和党相同的反动内外政纲，提出了杜鲁门和参议员巴克莱为该党今年的正副总统候选人；杜鲁门已决定于七月二十六日召开特别国会。（五）南北朝鲜各政党及公共团体领袖，在平壤举行了第二次联席会议，决定设立由选举产生的朝鲜最高人民议会及由南北朝鲜代表组成的单一朝鲜政府。
