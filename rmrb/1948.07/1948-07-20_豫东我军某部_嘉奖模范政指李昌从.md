Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, July 17th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army recently commended Li Changcong, the political instructor of the fourth company, a model political worker during the Kaifeng and Eastern Henan campaigns. Li was wounded in the head and cheek during the Kaifeng campaign, but when the company commander was killed and the deputy company commander was wounded, he took over the leadership of the entire company. After the battle ended, he immediately cleaned up weapons on the battlefield, reorganized the unit, and held meetings to prepare for continued combat. During the continuous and urgent marches, his cheek was swollen, but he continued to carry out mobilization and explanation work. He also used the suffering of the common people under the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army to educate the soldiers, so the company always maintained high morale. Immediately following the Kaifeng campaign, the company was thrown into the blocking action in Sui (County) and Qi (County) in Eastern Henan, to block the enemy's Qiu Qingquan Corps from reinforcing the Qu Shounian Corps. Li Changcong's wound became inflamed and festered, and he could not eat. However, he only rested in the rear for half a day before rushing back to the front line. On July 1st, the newly appointed company commander was killed in battle. Li Changcong immediately ran around the position, reading party newspapers to the soldiers in the trenches, conveying the Party Committee's call to commemorate "July 1st." He said, "The Communist Party is born to fight for the people. The bloodshed and sacrifice of revolutionary soldiers are all for the people." He called on all party members in the company to commemorate the Party's birthday with a spirit of tenacity, indomitable courage, and heroic fighting, and to avenge the company commander and the sacrificed soldiers. On July 2nd, the enemy's 5th Corps, eager to provide eastern reinforcements, launched an attack on the company's position with superior forces. The company's soldiers continuously inflicted casualties on the enemy. In the heat of battle, by dusk, only a few soldiers remained in the first squad, and six soldiers remained in the second squad. Li Changcong merged the two squads on the battlefield, appointing Wang Jichun, the original second squad leader, as the squad leader, and continued to fight the enemy. He said to Wang Jichun in a serious and passionate tone, "Remember, you are a Communist Party member. In the most urgent moments of battle, you must resolutely complete the task." When the soldiers of the whole company were running out of bullets, Li Changcong immediately ordered: "Take down the machine guns without bullets, everyone fix bayonets, and annihilate the enemy in front of the position!" Inspired by his heroic and fearless spirit, the soldiers responded enthusiastically and unanimously, saying, "Yes! We must hold the position and never retreat a step." They persisted until they received the order from their superiors to transfer to rest. After receiving the order, the first squad of the company immediately convened a squad meeting, requesting that they be given the task of continuing to fight.

　　豫东我军某部
    嘉奖模范政指李昌从
    【新华社豫东前线十七日电】解放军某部顷嘉奖在开封、豫东两次战役中模范政工干部四连政治指导员李昌从。李在开封战役中头部及腮部负伤，但当该连连长牺牲、副连长负伤时，他即担任领导全连的工作。战斗告一段落，立即在战地清理武器，整理组织，召开会议，准备继续战斗。在紧急连续的行军中，他的腮已肿起来了，但仍不断地进行动员解释工作。并以眼前所见老百姓遭受蒋匪军的灾害教育战士，所以该连始终保持着高涨的战斗情绪。紧接着开封战役该连又投入豫东睢（县）杞（县）阻击战阻击敌邱清泉兵团东援区寿年兵团时，李昌从的伤口发炎流脓，不能吃饭。但他仅在后方休息了半天，就又奔上火线。七月一日，该连新任连长在战斗中又牺牲了，李昌从即跑遍阵地，在工事里念党报给战士们听，传达党委纪念“七一”的号召，他说：“共产党生来就是为人民战斗的。革命战士们的流血牺牲，都是为了人民。”他号召全连党员，要以顽强不屈、英勇作战的精神来纪念党的生日，为连长及牺牲战士复仇。七月二日，敌整五军为急于东援，以优势兵力向该连阵地进攻，该连战士不断予敌杀伤。激战至黄昏，一班只剩下几个战士，二班剩下六个战士，李昌从就在战地上把两个班合并起来，以原二班长王季春任班长，继续与敌作战。他对王季春严肃而热情的说：“记着，你是共产党员，在战斗最紧急的时候，必须坚决完成任务。”当全连战士们的子弹快打完的时候，李昌从即下令：“把没有子弹的机枪拉下去，每个人上好刺刀，把敌人消灭在阵地前沿！”战士们在他的英勇不怕牺牲的感召下，都热烈的一致响应说：“对！我们要坚守阵地，决不后退一步。”他们一致坚持到接到上级调防休息的命令时止。该连一班在接到命令后立即召开班务会，要求给与继续战斗的任务。
