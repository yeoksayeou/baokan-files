　　Jilu Yu Farm Promotes Youzi Wheat Seeds
　　The Jilu Yu Administrative Office Farm is currently widely collecting Youzi wheat seeds in preparation for large-scale planting this year. This wheat variety was discovered in Qingfeng in 1945, and the Administrative Office Agricultural Experiment Station began trial planting. It yields a quarter more than other wheat varieties, produces more flour, and the flour is whiter. Yu Daoxing of Dongyuzhuang, Fan County, planted Youzi wheat and harvested 122 jin per mu, while the same land quality planted with other wheat yielded 90 jin. Successful trials have been conducted in Puyang, Guancheng, and Zhuxian counties. Due to proper cultivation methods, the Administrative Office Farm harvested 420 jin per mu. The Administrative Office has now issued a notice to the construction departments of all counties to exchange all the Youzi wheat stored last year for public grain to be kept as this year's wheat seeds. It has also been decided that if farmers use Youzi wheat seeds to plant in comparison with other wheat varieties and discover better seeds, the government will also provide commendations or material rewards.

　　冀鲁豫农场推广蚰子麦种
    冀鲁豫行署农场现正广收蚰子麦种，以备今年大量种植。该麦种自一九四五年在清丰发现，行署农业试验场便着手试种，比其他麦种多产四分之一，能多出面，面也白。范县东于庄于道兴种蚰子麦，每亩收一百二十二斤，同样地质种其他麦，则收九十斤。濮县、观城、筑先各县均试验成功。行署农场因种植得法，每亩收到四百二十斤。现行署已通令各县建设科将去年积存的蚰子麦都用公粮换出，留做今年麦种。并决定农民凡用蚰子麦种与其他各种麦种比较下种而发现更好的种籽者，政府亦予以表扬或物资奖励。
