　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: TASS reports: The leadership of the Italian Communist Party issued an appeal to the Italian people on July 16th, stating that the heinous plot to assassinate Togliatti has aroused a wave of anger and protest throughout Italy and the world. This wave has forced the politicians responsible for the current political situation in Italy and the assassination plot to feign regret. However, the united work stoppage of all sectors and all working people across the country, as well as the angry protest demonstrations—which are anti-government in nature—reflect the general belief that the responsibility for this despicable act ultimately lies with the reactionary forces' policy of conflict and provocation. The Italian General Confederation of Labor, which received the immediate, full, and heartfelt support of the People's Democratic Front, organized and led a massive mass movement, comparable only to the victorious uprisings of our country's working class in past years. Although the government threatened to use force, millions of working people—workers, office workers, farmers, and shopkeepers—rose up to warn the war-mongers, to warn those who would stop at nothing and at any cost to prevent the realization of new principles of people's democracy. Now, these destructive and brutal forces have heard the strong voice of working Italy, a voice that has been clearly expressed since the liberation of Italy: how great is the power of working Italy. The statement continued that, at this critical moment, the position taken by the government of church reactionaries, and its blatant desire to act with retaliation and assassination—as a result of which the people's blood has flowed in the streets and squares—has proven to the world more clearly than ever the correctness of the Communist Party's position, and because of this position, the Communist Party intends to intensify preparations to defend democratic freedom, the laws of the republic, and the rights of working people. The statement emphasized that all sincere democrats are convinced of the need for greater unity in order to meet the demands of the people across the country for a new political direction in our country, in order to prevent and thwart any attempts by the government to further incite any provocative and retaliatory actions due to the instigation of its reactionary plans. The statement concluded by saying that the Communist Party leadership extends its fraternal condolences to Comrade Togliatti, the leader of the Italian Communist Party, and we sincerely hope for his speedy recovery.

    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社报导：意共领导机关于七月十六日发表告意大利人民书称：谋害托格里亚蒂的罪恶阴谋，在全意大利和全世界激起了愤怒与抗议的浪潮。这一浪潮，使得那些应对意大利目前政治形势及谋害阴谋负责的政治家们，不得不伪装遗憾。但是，全国一切部门所有劳动人民的一致停止工作以及愤怒的抗议示威游行——它具有反政府性质——，反映了总的信念，即这一卑鄙行为的责任，归根在于反动派冲突与挑衅的政策。受到人民民主阵线立即、全部和衷心支持的意大利总工会，组织并领导了巨大的群众运动，这种情形只有我国劳动阶级在过去年代中胜利的起义堪与伦比。虽然政府威胁着要采用武力，但是成百万的劳动人民——工人、职员、农民和店主——都起来警告战争挑拨者，警告那些不惜采用一切办法和不惜任何代价以阻止新的人民民主原则之实现的人们。现在，这些破坏性的凶残的势力，已经听到了劳动的意大利底强有力的声音，这一声音自意大利解放之日起就十分明晰地表现了：劳动的意大利的力量是多么伟大。该文告继称，在这一严重的时刻，教会反动派的政府所采取的立场以及它借报复和暗杀以行动的露骨欲望——其结果，人民的血液已流在街头和广场——已向全世界较任何时候更清晰地证明了共产党立场的正确，而由于这一立场，共产党打算加紧准备活动，以保卫民主自由、共和国法律和劳动人民的权利。该文告着重指出，一切真诚的民主分子确信有更大的团结的必要，以便适应全国人民对我国新的政治方向的要求，以便防止并阻遏政府因其反动计划的鼓动而可能进一步发动的任何挑拨与报复行动的企图。该文告结语称，共产党领导机关对意共领袖托格里亚蒂同志致以兄弟的慰问，我们衷心祈望他早日康复。
