(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th) The spokesperson of the CCP Central Committee recently issued an urgent appeal regarding the Yellow River issue, stating:

　　The revetment works on the Yellow River's southern bank in the Dongming to Juancheng section at the junction of Hebei and Shandong provinces are facing the danger of breaching due to the sabotage by Kuomintang troops of the local residents' flood control efforts during the current flood season. If emergency action is not taken to immediately repair them, the risk of breaching is extremely serious. Once a breach occurs, millions of people in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and parts of Hebei provinces south of the lower reaches of the Yellow River will suffer a disaster even more severe than the Yellow River breach in 1938. Since the Yellow River returned to its original course, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government has established a special Yellow River Committee to guide local governments along the river to be responsible for annual dike repairs and flood prevention. Last year, in order to repair the revetment works on the north bank, we mobilized local people to contribute more than 86,000 cubic meters of stone, and despite the shooting and bombing by the Kuomintang army and air force, the project was completed. This year, although the dike repair work on the north bank has been hampered even more severely by the bombing of the Kuomintang army and air force, resulting in many civilian casualties, it was completed in May thanks to the concerted efforts and arduous struggle of the people. However, the situation on the south bank is far more dangerous due to frequent intrusions by Kuomintang troops. In particular, the four major revetment works in Gaocun, Liuzhuang, Zhukou, and Linpuji between Dongming and Juancheng have been repeatedly damaged since February of this year. Wooden stakes were removed to build bunkers, and iron ropes were cut and thrown into the river, causing many dams to experience slippage and water overflow. Large quantities of materials for repairing the revetment works have been burned, looted, and thrown into the river. Most seriously, the civilians repairing the revetment works have not only been bombed and strafed by Kuomintang aircraft, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries, but have also been directly attacked by Kuomintang troops, causing the project to be frequently interrupted. On June 16th, after our troops recovered Dongming, the Yellow River Committee and the local democratic government mobilized more than 45,000 civilians and more than 8,000 head of livestock to start repairing the major hazard at Gaocun, and within seven days, nine dams were raised to one to one and a half meters above the water surface. However, on the 4th and 6th of this month, the river's flow suddenly changed, and the facing dams of the 13th and 14th dams were washed away. Since the 7th of this month, Kuomintang aircraft have taken advantage of the situation to bomb wildly, and by the 11th, the number of our staff casualties had reached more than 100, causing the work to be interrupted, which is extremely regrettable. Subsequently, the Kuomintang Reorganized 55th Division, the 81st Brigade of the Reorganized 68th Division, and the Reorganized 47th Army, Reorganized 5th Army and other units reoccupied various points along the river from Dongming to Juancheng, making it even more impossible for us to continue the repairs. Therefore, the risk of a breach on the south bank of the Yellow River has reached an extremely critical juncture. The CCP Central Committee deeply feels that this matter concerns the lives and property of millions of people. If the Yellow River breaches and changes its course to the southeast into the sea, not only will the people in our Hebei-Shandong-Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu liberated areas bear the brunt, but the military and civilians in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially the Kuomintang troops on the south bank of the Yellow River, will be hard pressed to escape calamity. Therefore, we make the following urgent appeals to all parties concerned: (1) It is hoped that the Kuomintang troops on the south bank of the Yellow River will immediately stop obstructing the local residents from continuing to repair the river dikes and stop the acts of burning, looting, and sabotage. (2) It is hoped that the Kuomintang Air Force will immediately stop bombing and strafing the dike repair workers. (3) It is hoped that the Kuomintang water conservancy agencies will provide emergency assistance to the dike repair workers in terms of materials and technology. (4) It is hoped that all domestic and foreign relief, charity, and engineering organizations will provide emergency assistance to the dike repair workers in terms of materials and technology. (5) Whether now or in the future, the liberated area government will sincerely cooperate with any party that is sincerely willing to cooperate with the liberated area government in repairing the Yellow River dikes and jointly plan for progress. We believe that, due to the concerns for the lives and property of millions of people, our sincere appeals should be able to expect a good response. If the Kuomintang government and its troops treat the lives of millions of people as child's play and continue to sabotage the last efforts of the local people to seek survival, then the Kuomintang government shall bear full responsibility for all the disastrous consequences of the Yellow River breach.

　　中共中央发言人呼吁各方
  　紧急援助黄河抢险
  　国民党政府军队如不停止破坏将对一切灾难后果负完全责任
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】中共中央发言人，顷为黄河问题，发表紧急呼吁称：
    黄河南岸冀鲁两省交界处之东明至鄄城段险工，因当地居民的抢修工作，被国民党军队所破坏，在目前的伏泛中已面临决口的危险。如不采取紧急行动，立即抢修，则决口危险，极为严重。一旦决口，黄河下游以南之山东、河南、安徽、江苏各省及河北省一部的千百万人民，即将遭受较一九三八年黄河决口惨剧更严重的灾难。自黄河归故以后，我晋冀鲁豫边区政府即专设黄河委员会，指导沿岸地方政府负责每年修堤护堤，实行防汛。去年为修复北岸险工，曾动员当地人民献石八万六千余方，不顾国民党陆空军射击轰炸，卒告竣工。今年北岸修堤工作，虽因国民党陆空军轰击更甚，致民工死伤甚多，惟赖上下同心协力，艰苦奋斗，也已于五月间完成。独南岸则因国民党军队经常侵扰，情况远较险恶。尤以东明至鄄城间之高村、刘庄、朱口、临濮集四大险工，自今年二月以来，即迭遭破坏，木桩被拆去筑碉，铁绳被割断投河，致各坝多发生掉蛰漫水险象。人民修险工料，已被大批焚掠投河。其最严重者，则为修险民工，不但遭国民党飞机轰炸扫射，死伤累累，而且时遭国民党军队直接奔袭，致工程经常被迫停顿。上月十六日我军收复东明，黄河委员会及当地民主政府即动员民工四万五千余人，牲口八千余头，首先动工抢修高村大险，并已于七天内将九个坝修出水面一公尺至一公尺半。乃本月四日及六日河势突变，该处十三、十四两坝的镶头坝均被冲走；而本月七日以后，国民党飞机竟乘危狂炸，至十一日我员工伤亡人数已达一百余人，致工作顿告中断，极堪痛惜。其后，国民党整编五十五师，整编六十八师之八十一旅，及整编四十七军、整编五军等部，先后分别重占东明至鄄城沿河各点，我方继续抢修，更为势所难能。因此黄河南岸决口危险，已至异常严重关头。中共中央深感此事关系千百万人民生命财产；如果黄水奔决，改道向东南入海，则不独我冀鲁豫皖苏解放区人民首当其冲，即国民党统治区军民，首先是黄河南岸的国民党军队，亦绝难幸免。为此，特向有关各方作如下紧急呼吁：（一）希望黄河南岸国民党军队立即停止阻挠当地居民继续抢修河堤险工，并停止焚掠破坏行为。（二）希望国民党空军立即停止对修堤民工的轰炸扫射。（三）希望国民党水利机关在物质上、技术上对修堤民工予以紧急援助。（四）希望中外一切救济、慈善和工程团体在物质上、技术上对修堤民工予以紧急援助。（五）不论在目前或今后，凡任何方面诚意与解放区政府合作修复黄河堤岸者，解放区政府当必推诚合作，共策进行。我们相信：由于千百万人民生命财产所关，我们这些恳切的呼吁，应当可以期待良好的反应。如果国民党政府及其军队视千百万人命为儿戏，仍旧破坏当地人民的救死求生的最后努力，则黄河决口的一切灾难后果，应由国民党政府负其全责。
