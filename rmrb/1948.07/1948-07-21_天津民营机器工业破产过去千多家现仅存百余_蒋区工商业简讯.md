Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Brief News on Industry and Commerce in the Chiang Area:
    △ Tianjin Dagongbao reported: Tianjin's private machine industry originally had over a thousand firms, but due to poor business, by April of this year, only about a hundred remained, and most of them were in a state of shutdown. The city's private rubber industry had a total of sixty-two factories, and production generally declined sharply. Taking the larger Yuhua and Zhenzhong factories as examples, the two factories had a total of four hundred workers and could each produce 1,200 sets of inner and outer tires per day, not to mention other rubber shoes, etc., and had an attached iron factory. However, from the summer of last year to May of this year, the two factories, due to business difficulties, successively reduced their business scope and merged into one factory, with only one hundred workers left. The daily output plummeted to 300-400 sets of inner and outer tires each, and the attached iron factory was completely shut down.
    △ According to Jinan's "North China News" on May 16th: In Jinan, more than 300 businesses closed down voluntarily in April due to heavy taxes and poor business, including more than 100 grain businesses, more than 100 oil businesses, and more than 100 flour businesses.
    △ Shanghai Dagongbao reported on May 24th: Under the assault of the economic storm, Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company declared bankruptcy on May 24th due to sluggish business. It is reported that the company is one of the top ten shipping companies in the Chiang area, with more than 10,000 tons of ocean-going vessels.
    △ Tianjin Xin Xing Bao continuously disclosed on June 10th and 11th: The Tianjin East Railway Station authorities recently used the excuse of "unified inspection" to force all transported goods to pay a "transfer fee" starting from the 8th. It is calculated that each item of goods weighing 60 kilograms or less would be charged 25,000 yuan, and the amount would increase up to 100,000 yuan. The city's contracting and transportation industry, unable to withstand the exploitation, has protested to the Chiang authorities for days. The railway bureau was forced to slightly reduce the amount to be paid. The industry is still continuing to protest, demanding the complete cancellation of this unreasonable exploitation.

  　蒋区工商业简讯
    【新华社陕北十八日电】蒋区工商业简讯：
    △天津大公报载：天津民营机器工业原有一千余家，因营业不振，至本年四月间已仅剩百余家，且其中多陷停工状态。该市民营橡胶业共有六十二家工厂，产量亦普遍锐减，以较大的钰华、震中为例，两厂共有工人四百人，每天各能生产内外胎各一千二百付，其他胶鞋等尚不计在内，并附设有一铁工厂；但自去年夏季直到今年五月间，该二厂即因营业困难，先后缩减业务范围，合并为一厂，工人只剩一百人，每天产量激降至内外胎各三、四百付，附设之铁工厂则完全停业。
    △据济南“华北新闻”五月十六日披露：济南商号于四月份因苛捐繁重，营业不振而自动歇业者达三百余家之多，内包括粮业、油业各百余家，面粉等百余家。
    △沪大公报五月二十四日讯：在经济风暴袭击下，上海华商轮船公司因营业清淡，已于五月二十四日宣告倒闭。按该公司为蒋区十大轮船公司之一，拥有海轮万余吨。
    △天津新星报六月十、十一日连续披露：天津东火车站当局近假借“统一检查”借口，于八日起，强迫所有运输货物缴纳“转搬费”，计每件货物六十公斤以下者勒收二万五千元，以次增加至十万元不等。该市承揽运输业以不堪榨取，连日向蒋记当局提出抗议，将记铁路局被迫将缴额稍稍减低，该业现仍继续抗争，要求完全取消此项无理剥削。
