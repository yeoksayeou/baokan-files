　　Using New Working Methods and Improved Technology
  　Completing a Fifteen-Year Plan in Thirty Months
  　Two New Labor Heroes Emerge in the Soviet Union
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th】 TASS reports: Two Soviet workers created a new record at the beginning of the month by completing a fifteen-year production plan, that is, completing three five-year plans. One is Bykov, a lathe worker at the Moscow Machine Manufacturing Plant, and the other is Akopov, a lathe worker at the Baku Machine Manufacturing Plant. They both organized their work with the new constitution and improved their technology, enabling them to cut 850 meters of metal per minute. As a result, they steadily completed six months of their production plan in one month, and completed the equivalent of three five-year plans or one hundred and eighty months of production in the past thirty months. Akopov not only increased the number of revolutions of the lathe, but also enabled the lathe to manufacture four ball bearings in thirty to thirty-five minutes, compared to the original plan of manufacturing one ball bearing in forty-five to fifty minutes.

  　苏联出现两个新劳动英雄
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联有两个工人于月初创造了完成十五年生产计划，也就是完成三个五年计划的新纪录。一个是莫斯科机器制造厂旋盘工人比柯夫，另一个是巴库机器制造厂旋盘工人阿柯波夫。他们都是以新的宪法组织工作，改善技术，因而在一分钟内能够裁切八百五十公尺金属；结果他们在一个月内就稳稳地完成了六个月的生产计划，在过去三十个月内就完成了相当于三个五年计划的一百八十个月的生产计划。阿柯波夫不仅增加了车床的旋转次数，而且使车床在三十到三十五分钟内能制造四个球轴承，原定计划是四十五分钟到五十分钟内制造一个球轴承。
