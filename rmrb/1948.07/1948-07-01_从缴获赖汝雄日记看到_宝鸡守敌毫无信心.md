Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th. From the diary of Lai Ruxiong, Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang 76th Division, seized during the Northwest People's Liberation Army's liberation of Baoji, one can see that the enemy had no confidence in defending Baoji. On April 18th, Lai met with Liu, the Baoji Garrison Commander, who boasted to him, "If the bandits attack, I will immediately lead my troops to the suburbs to join local armed forces and fight a guerrilla war." When the 29th Army was annihilated in Yichuan, Lai was training at the Central Training Corps in Nanjing. His diary reads: "Army Commander Liu (Kan) led the 27th and 90th Divisions to reinforce Yichuan, and was annihilated by the Communist army on March 1st. The Army Commander and Division Commander Yan (Ming) died in battle, shocking the entire nation. On March 2nd, I went to the Ministry of National Defense to inquire about the truth. I couldn't sleep for two days, and I felt extremely fearful about the situation in the Northwest." On March 23rd, Hu Zongnan summoned him in Xi'an. The Yichuan battle was originally Hu Zongnan's responsibility, but Hu pushed it onto the dead Liu Kan. Lai's diary recorded Hu Zongnan's words: "In the Qingjian battle, I (Hu referring to himself) told him (referring to Liu Kan) to take two divisions to relieve the siege, but he failed to attack fiercely and decisively, delaying for four hours, resulting in the 76th Division suffering losses. This time, he has already died in the Yichuan battle. I won't even mention that we didn't have any rewards or punishments for such a large war. After the Qingjian and Zhenchuanbao (referring to the Shajiadian battle) battles, I didn't even hold a review meeting. Why didn't I hold one? Because once I did, Army Commander Liu would have to take responsibility."

### 从缴获赖汝雄日记看到　宝鸡守敌毫无信心

　　从缴获赖汝雄日记看到
    宝鸡守敌毫无信心
    【新华社西北廿九日电】西北解放军解放宝鸡之役，曾缴获蒋匪整七六师参谋长赖汝雄日记一册，从那个日记可以看到敌人对宝鸡防守毫无信心。四月十八日赖去见宝鸡警备司令刘某，刘对他吹牛说：“匪如来犯，当即率领所部到郊外联络地方武装去打游击。”整二十九军在宜川被歼时，赖正在南京中央训练团受训，日记中这样写着：“刘（戡）军长率二十七、九十两师增援宜川，三月一日被共军歼灭，军长及严（明）师长殉职，全国震动。余于三月二日往国防部询探真情，两日未曾入睡，对西北局面实觉惶恐之至也。”三月二十三日，胡宗南在西安召见他。宜川战役本来是胡宗南的责任，可是胡却推在死了的刘戡头上。赖日记中记胡宗南的话说：“清涧之役，我（胡自称）叫他（指刘戡）带两个师去解围，他不能猛烈果敢的攻击，迟了四个钟头，结果使七十六师吃了亏。这次宜川战役他已死了。我且不说这样大的战争我们一点奖罚都没有。当清涧、镇川堡（按指沙家店战役）两次战役后，我连检讨会都没有开。为什么不开呢？因为一开就要刘军长负责。”
