Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: Although this report by Thorez is eight or nine months old, it remains an important material for understanding the current political situation in France, especially the political line and lessons of the French Communist Party since World War II. It is published for readers in various regions to study international issues and the tactics in the united front.

　　　　The Communist Party is Still the Largest Party
Our Party has every reason to be proud and to face the future with confidence, because despite de Gaulle's exemplary anti-communist movement, and the fact that all other parties, from the Socialist Party to the most despicable reactionaries, have included anti-communism in their platforms, and despite the arbitrary election laws that are unfavorable to us and allow the Socialist Party and the de Gaulle faction to collude in the appointment of municipal organs, we have still won the strong support of one-third of the men and women of France.

Official statistics, as usual, distort the elections to favor the reactionaries, but the result is that we are still the largest party.

In towns with more than 9,000 people, the number of seats won is as follows:
	Party				Number of Seats			Percentage
	Communist Party			3,993				30.64
	Socialist Party			2,107				16.12
	Radical Party			531
	Popular Republican Movement	1,682				12.91
	De Gaulle faction		3,762				28.86
	Republican Liberty Party	257

In these towns, our vote rate reached 30 percent. In medium-sized areas, the rate is not low, and there has generally been some progress in these areas.

Since the liberation of France, our progress has been continuous. 26 percent in October 1945; 26.2 percent in June 1946; 28.6 percent in October 1946; and 29.2 percent in November 1946.

De Gaulle boasted that he would give our Communist Party a major blow. This little dictator rightly sees our Party as the main obstacle to his establishment of personal power. But the election results show that the efforts of all our enemies have failed to weaken the strong position of our Communist Party. Our Party is deeply rooted in our country. There have been local setbacks, and we will examine the reasons for them, but in many places, we have made new gains. On a national scale, we have done more than just maintain our original position.

　　　　Wall Street and France
Former U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, recently said that it is necessary to intensify what he calls "the struggle for France." American capitalists are trying to enslave our country, they want to end our economic and political independence, to end our national sovereignty, and they want to turn our country into a semi-colony, like Portugal or Chile.

The American plan to give priority to the restoration of German industry is completely contrary to the interests of France. The Brown report (Note: Advisor to General Clay, Commander of the U.S. Forces in Germany) aims to completely deprive us of coal from the Ruhr, which is the inevitable result of the surrender policies successively adopted by Léon Blum and Bidault on the issue of reparations and coal.

It is now clear that the British and American governments, which prevent us from obtaining German coal through reparations, have only one purpose: to make us dependent on them. They are hindering our recovery. They do not want a strong, prosperous France that can resist their pressure, either in the past or now. They do not tolerate a highly industrialized France with high steel production. These productions are the guarantee of our economic and political independence.

　　　　The Colonialization of the French Economy
What the United States needs is to eliminate some of our industries, or to control them to obtain profits.

Ford and General Motors are trying to gain control of our automobile industry. Through its connection with International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (another American trust), the American trust Thomson-Houston Alstom has become the boss of our production of electrical and telephone equipment. American banks have significant shares in many French enterprises.

The situation is the same in our overseas territories. American shares account for a significant portion of companies in Guinea, Togo (both on the Atlantic coast of French West Africa), Guyana (on the northeast Atlantic coast of South America), and Madagascar (in the Indian Ocean southeast of Africa).

The French aircraft manufacturing industry has been sacrificed. Contrary to the selfish assertions slandered by the reactionaries, all aircraft manufacturing companies in the country, except for one, have lost money. The French government has not repaid the 9 billion francs owed to them, which has put them in difficulty.

American financiers are naturally interested in French overseas territories. They are determined to seize the sources of those raw materials. They want to open up the markets of North Africa and Vietnam to increase their exports.

At our Party's Tenth National Congress, we formulated a plan to develop power, coal and electricity resources. The "Monnet Plan" specifically stipulates the necessary investment to renovate and modernize the machinery and equipment of our coal mines and to build large hydropower stations. The Americans are now about to invest the first 30 billion francs of capital in the Ruhr coal mines, thus eliminating the Monnet Plan.

Our coal, electricity, and gas companies have to wait for the (American) capitalists to be happy before they can continue to operate.

The same is true for construction. While many people are waiting for houses to live in, land is left vacant, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. In September of this year, 27 medium-sized construction companies had to close down. The whole of France, from Dunkirk to Marseille, from Brest to Strasbourg, is a scene of ruins and rubble. "French films are in trouble, they will soon be finished." Dr. Mabire-Barnor of the Institute warned. This is the sad result of the Blum-Byrnes agreement. L'Humanité published figures showing the re-destruction of our industry and the victory of American competitors: In the first half of 1946, 38 American films and 35 French films obtained permits, in the second half the figures were 145 and 46, and in the first half of 1947 they were 338 and 35.

But the problem is not just that the Americans are making a lot of money, and the poverty and unemployment of workers, musicians, and artists working in the French film industry. We must see another side to this fact, namely the ideological preparation that the United States is carrying out on the French people it is trying to enslave. This is a measure to disintegrate the French nation. This is a way for the United States to try to corrupt and seduce French youth through these films. Because in American films, it is either love or superstition, or robbers becoming emperors. These films cannot help cultivate a generation of French citizens who understand their responsibilities to France and the Republic, but can only cultivate a group of slaves who kowtow under oppression. How can the United States make good films when many of the best artists are oppressed for being accused of being communist sympathizers?

As for the essence of American expansionist economics, it is inevitably supplemented by the establishment of military and strategic bases in countries under the control of the Gold Standard imperialism. On September 9, 1947, Le Figaro (Note: de Gaulle's newspaper - editor) unreservedly admitted: "Because France is at the tip of Western Europe, close to England, and because she owns land in Africa, she is within the American security zone."

　　　　American Interference in Our Internal Affairs
The United States is fiercely interfering in our internal affairs. American rulers and other congressmen, all merchants and tourists who trade in corned beef and chewing gum, simply do not hide this point. They arrogantly give orders. American imperialism supports all the reactionary forces in France. The American New York Post wrote: "De Gaulle is using our anti-communist fever, hoping to rely on this to get our help, just like we give help to the reactionaries in China and Greece. We have reached such a situation that only those who are furthest away from the interests of their own people welcome our interference."

The United States has spent millions of dollars trying to give the French General Confederation of Labor a blow. They have set up offices in Paris, specializing in organizing the struggle against the French General Confederation of Labor. In this regard, the United States is using some Socialist Party leaders, who have done their best to split the trade union organizations of the post office, the Paris transport industry, and other enterprises.

　　　　Léon Blum is a Supporter of American Imperialism
It is obvious that the American plan to enslave our country would not have succeeded without the support of the Socialist Party leaders, especially Léon Blum and Ramadier. American imperialism and the "Marshall Plan": "France has no better supporter than Léon Blum. He not only pushed France down this unfortunate road in negotiations with the United States and Britain in Washington and London, but he also tried his best to satisfy the cruel demands of American policy, which appeared generous and unambitious. He is the only person in France who dares to say that American capitalists do not need to export. This attitude did not prevent him from facilitating the screening of American films in France, nor did it prevent him from helping the United States to replace Ruhr coal with its expensive coal. And the Ruhr coal was precisely what he (Blum) gave up. We said at our Party's Eleventh National Congress: Blum "idealizes the expansion policy of American monopoly capitalists, the result of which can only be to disarm the French working class and the people ideologically and politically, so that they cannot resist the infringement of international financial forces that endanger our national independence."

Léon Blum believes that the term "national sovereignty" is a "nationalist term," and that this concept is outdated. He put forward his theory of "supranational international communes" to oppose national sovereignty. He wants to blur the understanding of workers who believe in internationalism. He disguises his abandonment of independence and national sovereignty with democracy and progress, which only benefits American imperialism. However, workers will not confuse proletarian internationalism with the globalism of trusts.

　　　　Blum and Mollet are Against the Soviet Union and Against Peace
Léon Blum and Guy Mollet (Note: Secretary-General of the French Socialist Party - editor) have always been sophists who deceive the working class and those who truly love peace. Workers and peace-loving people criticize the aggressive aims of the imperialist camp and oppose the danger of war. They also believe that these are threats to the whole world. The Socialist Party leaders say that this is to agree to divide the world into two, to recognize that conflict is inevitable, and to accept war.

The Socialist Party leaders stubbornly say two blocs, the purpose of which is only to try to obscure the masses' correct understanding of the real situation. It should be noted that the imperialist camp has been formed under the guidance of the United States for the benefit of the United States. Blum and de Gaulle want to put France in this imperialist camp. As for the opposing camp, it is not a group of several countries, but a great unity of all the working-class democratic and anti-imperialist forces in the world, fighting for freedom and peace. This anti-imperialist camp has the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries as its strong foundation.

　　　　"The Third Force" is to Split the Working Class
The Socialist Party leaders play the role of the "third force." Some people may ask, isn't it important to unite all workers and all Republicans to prevent de Gaulleism, and to unite them into a single force against the reactionaries and imperialist war?

In reality, "the third force" means splitting the working class and helping the reactionaries. Isn't it noteworthy that the extreme left-wing Mollet, the ultra-left-wing Biver, this authentic Trotskyist agitator, has become the vanguard of the Socialist Party and the reactionaries' united activities against the towns dominated by the Communist Party? The Socialist Party leaders collude to support the de Gaulle faction. They are either elected by accepting the support of the reactionaries, or they help the reactionaries to be elected.

Obviously, we cannot unite all workers and Republicans to fight against imperialism and its running dogs and win victory unless we severely criticize the Socialist Party leaders. The Socialist Party leaders play the role of accomplices and executors in the US policy of enslaving our country. This policy as a whole is against the working masses and only benefits international reactionaries.

Our sacred task of the French Communist Party is to hold high the banner of fighting for national independence and sovereignty more firmly than ever before.

We have shown that our Communist Party, this French political party, is indeed capable of uniting and organizing all the forces in France who are determined to defend national glory and independence to fight against the forces of oppression. (To be continued)

　　保卫共和——捍卫我们的民族独立
    （法共总书记多列士于一九四七年十月二十九日对法共中央委员会的报告节要）
    新华社编者按：多烈士的这篇报告，时间距现在虽已有八九个月，但仍是了解法国目前政局特别是了解法共在第二次世界大战以来政治路线及其教训的重要材料，特为发表，以供各地读者研究国际问题和统一战线中的策略问题之参考。
    　　　　共产党还是第一大政党
    我们的党完全有理由可以自豪，并且可以充满着信心面向将来，因为尽管戴高乐以身作则进行了猛烈的反共运动，以及一切其他政党，从社会党到最卑劣的反动派，都把反共列入政纲，尽管独断的选举法对我们不利，而使社会党和戴高乐派在任命市政机关时，得以狼狈为奸，我们还是获得了全法国男女人民中三分之一的坚强支持。
    官方统计照例对选举作对反动派有利的歪曲报导，但是结果我们还是第一大党。
    在有九千人以上的市镇中，当选席数如下：政党　　　　　　　席数　　　　　　　　　　　　百分比共产党　　　　　三、九九三　　
　　　　　　　三○点六四社会党　　　　　二、一○七　　　　　　
　　　一六点一二急进党　　　　　五三一人民共和党　　　一、六八二　　　　　　　　一二点九一戴高乐派　　　三、七六二　　　　　
　　　　二八点八六自由共和党　　二五七
    在这些市镇，我们的选票比率达百分之三十。在中等地区，比率也不低，大体上在这些地区还有若干进步。
    法国解放以来，我们的进步是不断的。一九四五年十月占百分之二十六；一九四六年六月百分之二十六点二；一九四六年十月百分之二十八点六；一九四六年十一月百分之二十九点二。
    戴高乐吹牛说：他要给我们共产党一个重大打击，这位小独裁者把我们党看做他建立个人权力的主要障碍，是有道理的。但是选举的结果，表现我们的所有的敌人们的努力，都没有能够削弱我们共产党的坚强地位。我们的党在我国是根深蒂固的。地方性的挫折是有的，我们将检讨其原因，但是在许多地方，我们有了新的收获。以全国而论，我们不止维持了原有的地位而已。
    　　　　华尔街和法国
    前美国驻法大使布立特最近说，加紧他称为“争取法国的斗争”，是必要的，美国的大资本家正想奴役我国，他们要结束我们的经济和政治的独立，要结束我们国家的主权，他们要把我国变成半殖民地，象葡萄牙或智利一样。
    美国计划优先恢复德国工业，这是和法国的利益完全相违背的。布朗（按为德境美军司令克莱的顾问）报告以完全剥夺我们从鲁尔取得煤为目的，这是莱翁·勃鲁姆和比道尔对赔偿和煤的问题先后采取了投降政策的必然结果。
    现在很清楚，不使我们经过赔偿以获得德国煤的英美政府，其唯一的目的，就是叫我们依赖他们，他们阻碍了我们的复兴，他们在以前和现在都不要有一个能够抵抗他们压力的、强大的、繁荣的法国，他们不容忍一个高度工业化的、钢铁生产很高的法国，这些生产正是我们经济和政治上独立的保障。
    　　　　法国经济的殖民地化
    美国所需要的是消灭我们的若干工业，或加以控制获得利润。
    福特和通用汽车公司正设法取得对我国汽车工业的控制，美国的托拉斯，汤姆生——胡斯顿·阿尔斯多姆通过国际电话电报公司（这是另一美国托拉斯）之联系，成了我国电机和电话设备的生产老板。美国银行在许多法国企业中有重要的股份。
    在我国海外地区中，情形也一样，在几内亚、多哥（按上两地在法属西非大西洋岸）、圭亚那（按在南美东北大西洋岸）和马达加斯加（按在非洲东南印度洋）的若干公司中，美国股份占了重要部分。
    法国飞机制造业是被牺牲了。和反动派所污蔑的、自私的断言相反，全国所有制造飞机的公司，除一家外，都赔了钱。法国政府不将所欠的九十亿法郎还给他们，使他们遇到了困难。
    美国金融界自然对法国海外地区表示兴趣，他们决心攫取那些原料的来源，他们要北非和越南的市场开放，增加他们的输出。
    在我们党第十次全国代表大会，我们拟定了发展动力、煤和电力资源的计划。“孟纳计划”具体规定了使我国煤矿的机器及设备革新与现代化，及建设大水电站的必要的投资数目。美国人却正要对鲁尔煤矿投入第一笔资本的三百亿法郎，这样他们就消除了孟纳计划。
    我国煤矿电力和煤气公司，不得不等待（美国）资本家们高兴时才能工作下去。
    建设事业也一样，当许多人都在等着房子住的时候，地皮却空在那里，失业的人一天天增加，今年九月，二十七家中等建筑公司不得不关门。整个法国从敦刻尔克到马赛、从布勒斯特到斯特拉斯堡，一片废墟瓦砾。“法国电影不得了，不久就要完蛋了。”研究院的马宾·巴诺尔博士这样警告着。这是勃鲁姆——贝纳斯协定的可悲结果。人道报发表数字，显示我国工业的再次破坏和美国竞争者们的胜利：一九四六年上半年，三十八部美国电影，三十五部法国电影取得检讫准演执照，下半年中数字是一百四十五部和四十六部，而一九四七年上半年则是三百三十八部和卅五部。
    但是问题还不止是美国人赚了许多钱，而法国电影业中工作的工人、音乐师和艺术家的贫困和失业而已。我们必须在这件事实中，看到另一面，即美国对她企图奴役的法国人民所进行的思想准备。这是瓦解法兰西民族的一项措施，这是美国企图经过这些影片，来腐化和诱惑法国青年的一种办法。因为在美国电影中，不是恋爱就是迷信，再不就是强盗当皇帝。这些影片，不能帮助培养一代懂得自己对法国对共和国的责任的法国公民，而只能培养出一批在压迫之下叩头的奴隶。当许多最优秀的艺术家，被控为共产党的同情者而遭受压迫时，美国怎么制造得出好影片来呢？
    论到美国扩张主义经济的实质，乃不可避免的辅之以在金元帝国主义控制下的国家中，实现建立起军事的和战略的基地。一九四七年九月九日费加罗报（按为戴高乐的报纸——编者）毫不掩饰地承认：“因为法国处在西欧的尖端，靠近英国，并因为她在非洲拥有土地，她就处在美国安全区域之内”。
    　　　　美国干涉我们的内政
    美国正凶猛的干涉我们的内政。美国统治者及其他国会议员、所有作腌牛肉和口香糖生意的商人和游客们，干脆毫不掩饰这点。他们傲慢地下命令。美帝国主义支持着法国的一切反动势力，美国的纽约邮报写道：“戴高乐利用我们的反共热，希望这样就靠得住得到我们对他的帮助，好象我们给中国和希腊反动派帮助一样。我们已经到了这样的情形，只有那些和他们本国人民的利益离得最远的人们才欢迎我们的干涉”。
    美国花了千百万美元，企图借此给法国总工会一个打击。他们在巴黎设立了办事处，专门负责组织反对法国总工会的斗争。在这方面，美国正利用若干社会党领袖，他们已经尽力分裂邮政、巴黎运输业及其他企业的工会组织。
    　　　　莱翁·勃鲁姆是美帝国主义的拥护者
    如果不是社会党领袖，特别是莱翁·勃鲁姆和拉马第，给以支持，美国奴役我国的计划便没有成功的机会，这是明显的。美帝国主义和“马歇尔计划”“法国再没有比莱翁·勃鲁姆更好的拥护者了。他不仅在华盛顿和伦敦与美英办交涉中把法国推进这条倒霉的道路，并且他还尽力满足以慷慨、无野心姿态出现的美国政策的残酷要求。法国只有他一个人敢说美国资本家用不着输出。他的这种态度，却并没有阻止他不给美国影片在法国放映以方便，也没有阻止他帮助美国以其价格高昂的煤代替鲁尔的煤。而鲁尔的煤正是他（勃鲁姆）放弃了的。我们在我党十一次全国代表大会上说：勃鲁姆“把美国独占资本家的扩张政策理想化，其结果只能是在思想上和政治上，解除法国工人阶级及人民的武装，使其不能抵抗那种危害我们民族独立的国际金融势力之侵害”。
    莱翁·勃鲁姆认为“国家主权”的名词是“国家主义的名词”，他认为这个概念已经过时了。他提出了他的“超主权的国际公社”的理论，来反对国家主权。他想模糊信仰国际主义的工人的认识，他以伪装的民主和进步，掩饰其放弃独立和国家主权，这只对美帝国主义有好处。然而，工人是不会把无产阶级的国际主义和托拉斯的全球主义混淆起来的。
    　　　　勃鲁姆和摩勒是反对苏联、反对和平的
    莱翁·勃鲁姆和盖·摩勒（按为法社会党总书记——编者）一向是欺骗工人阶级和真正爱好和平的人们的诡辩老手。工人和爱好和平的人们，抨击帝国主义营垒的侵略的目的，反对战争危险，他们又认为这些是对整个世界的威胁。社会党领袖却说，这就是同意把世界分裂为二，承认冲突不可避免，接受战争。
    社会党领袖顽固地说两个集团，其目的只有企图模糊群众对真实情形的正确的认识。须知帝国主义营垒已经在美国的指导之下，为了美国的利益而形成了。勃鲁姆和戴高乐要把法国放在这个帝国主义营垒之内。至于与此相反的营垒，那不是若干国家的集团，而是全世界所有的工人阶级民主的反帝国主义的力量的大团结，是为自由与和平而奋斗的。这个反帝国主义的营垒，是以苏联和新民主主义国家为其强有力的基础的。
    　　　　“第三种力量”就是分裂工人阶级
    社会党领袖担任“第三种力量”的角色，有人会问为了阻止戴高乐主义而做到团结一切工人和一切共和分子，把他们团结成为一个单一的力量，反对反动派和帝国主义战争，难道不重要吗？
    实际上，“第三种力量”意思就是分裂工人阶级和帮助反动派。极左派摩勒、超左派比佛，这种道地的托洛茨基派煽动家，成了社会党及反动派联合起来反对共产党占优势的市镇的活动的先锋，该是值得注意的吧？社会党的领袖而狼狈为奸地支持戴高乐派，他们不是接受反动派的支持而当选，就是帮助反动派当选。
    显然的，我们若不严厉斥责社会党领袖，就不能团结一切工人和共和分子进行反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，并获得胜利。社会党领袖对美国奴役我国的政策起着共谋与执行者的作用。这政策整个是反对劳动群众而只是对国际反动派有利的。
    我们法国共产党的神圣任务，是要比任何时候更坚定的、高举为民族独立和主权而斗争的旗帜。
    我们已经表现出我们的共产党，这个法兰西政党，是的确能够团结、和组织领导法国一切决心保卫民族光荣独立的力量来与压迫势力进行斗争的。（未完）
