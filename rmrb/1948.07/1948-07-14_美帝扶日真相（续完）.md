　　　　　IX. Helping the Japanese Bandits Re-Invade China

All the above-mentioned measures taken by the United States to support Japan have resulted, in part, in Japan re-invading China. In fact, the re-invasion of China by Japanese aggressors with the help of the United States is not just a possibility; in many respects, it is already happening.

Under MacArthur's orders, the Chiang government decided on August 1st of last year to formally resume Sino-Japanese trade, agreeing to supply Japan with raw materials such as salt, iron, coal, soybeans, and tung oil. In January of this year, the Chiang government's delegation to Japan signed a contract with the Japanese government to export 20,000 tons of soybeans to Japan. At the same time, another batch of 30,000 tons is being negotiated. The number of Chinese salt exports to Japan was 500,000 tons the year before last, 200,000 tons last year, and is planned to be 500,000 tons this year. The amount of ore was 200,000 tons the year before last, the number for last year is unknown, but 250,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island, which was ordered at the end of last year, is currently being shipped. Relying mainly on Hainan Island's iron ore, the production volume of Japan's largest steel factory – Yawata Steel Works – is increasing monthly, and its second rolling mill has now reopened. Fearing that the supply of Hainan Island iron ore would be insufficient, MacArthur introduced Takeda Kengo, president of Asahi Industries, and Keiichi Iriye and Genkura Okada, key members of Taihei Industries, to Song Ziwen in April this year to expand iron ore mining on Hainan Island. In the same month, a delegation led by North, director of the Civil Affairs Division of the US Army Department, passed through Tokyo to Nanjing and Shanghai to draft plans on how to expand Sino-Japanese trade and implement the plan of "American capital, Japanese industry, and Chinese raw materials."

As for goods imported from Japan, in addition to machinery, sleepers, locomotives, vehicles, rails, explosives, and other war-related materials needed by Chiang's bandits for the civil war, there are also cotton textiles, rayon, paper, dyes, bicycles, and seafood. According to the Tianjin Dagong Daily on July 22nd of last year, "Japan's planned exports this year are primarily yarn and textiles, accounting for slightly less than half of the total. Raw silk and rayon account for about a quarter. Machinery accounts for one-tenth. The rest are ceramics, glass, aquatic products, and medicines. Looking at these tables, it is an epitome of Japan's export items before the war. It is a weapon for a light industrial country to carry out economic aggression against colonies and semi-colonies. … (China) will still be bound in this typical colonial trade network, at a loss."

Reports on the smuggling of Japanese goods are occasionally published in the Chiang-controlled areas. South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have become three transshipment points for Japanese goods, flowing into North China from South Korea and into Guangzhou and Shanghai from Hong Kong and Taiwan, dumping goods in central and southern China. Japanese-made daily necessities and cotton textiles often imitate American trademarks. Genuine and fake American goods flood the major coastal cities of our country.

In May 1946, after MacArthur allowed Japan to hunt whales in the Antarctic, he also ordered Chiang Kai-shek to conclude an agreement with the US occupation headquarters, allowing 40 Japanese fishing vessels to enter the high seas between China and Japan to fish. As a result, Japanese fishing boats further intruded into our territorial waters. In recent years, such acts of aggression have occurred frequently. In just one recent instance in late May, nearly 20 fishing vessels were discovered by the Chiang government's warship Zhongjian, penetrating 150 nautical miles into our territorial waters. According to the "Record of Japanese Fishing Vessels Fishing Beyond the Border" written by Harada Seiichi, a Japanese fishing boat crew member, translated by the Tianjin Xin Xing Daily on May 3rd, and the Central News Agency's Shanghai report on June 1st about the Chiang government seizing Japanese fishing boats, these fishing boats were converted from gunboats, equipped with weapons or even gun emplacements, and the crew members were former Japanese naval personnel, not only wearing military uniforms but also bearing "China Incident" commemorative badges. However, the Chiang government's Ministry of Navy stipulates that fishing vessels caught intruding into our territorial waters will only have their fishing gear confiscated, and the personnel will be returned to the Allied Headquarters for handling, but the Allied Headquarters has never handled a single case. The Beiping Xinmin Daily stated on May 26th: "If we hand over the Japanese who specialize in undermining China's territorial sovereignty to the Allied Headquarters, and the Allied Headquarters give them special training, these Japanese will be able to easily become vanguards for coastal landings with real weapons."

As for our compatriots residing in Japan, they still do not have the status of citizens of a victorious nation and are regarded as "third-country people." Under US indulgence, the reactionary Japanese government has canceled the same food rations that our overseas Chinese should enjoy as British, American, and other foreign overseas Chinese, closed 3,000 overseas Chinese restaurants, and frozen 2 billion Japanese yen in pre-war deposits of overseas Chinese, making it impossible for unemployed overseas Chinese to return to China. Japanese police arbitrarily search the homes and shops of overseas Chinese and confiscate goods. All these heartbreaking facts have received the support of the American authorities. In July 1946, police officers from the Shibuya Japanese Police Station in Tokyo unreasonably drove out Taiwanese overseas Chinese vendors in the area and massacred them with machine guns, causing dozens of casualties. The US occupation authorities not only refused to punish the perpetrators but ordered the Taiwanese to be deported. Afterward, the Japanese government expressed gratitude to MacArthur's headquarters for supporting the illegal atrocities of the Japanese bandits and decided to strengthen the "crackdown" on "non-Japanese."

As the arrogance of the Japanese bandits' re-invasion of China is constantly encouraged, Japanese parliamentarians have openly demanded in parliament that referendums be held in the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and Northeast China to determine their status; Ashida has demanded that the United States return the Ryukyu Islands and requested special immigration rights for Taiwan. On May 11th, the Chinese-language "China-Japan Daily" in Tokyo even clamored for "the merger of China and Japan," and the Japanese who retreated from the Northeast also repeatedly shouted: "We will be back in twenty years." If the United States' actions to support Japan are not stopped, the Japanese bandits will eventually launch another war of aggression against China.

The policy of US imperialism to support the Japanese bandits at the expense of China did not begin today. At the time of the September 18th Incident, US Secretary of State Stimson touted the so-called "non-recognition doctrine," but in fact, secret documents released by the US State Department the year before last proved that the US policy at the time was to "prevent international action against Japan from being too extreme" and to "oppose the use of economic sanctions." (According to the Dagong Daily on June 26th of the year before last) Throughout the period from the September 18th Incident to shortly before the Pacific War, the United States supplied Japan with large quantities of materials. During the July 7th War of Aggression against China, Japanese planes used American gasoline and American scrap iron to make bombs and bombed peaceful Chinese cities and residents.

　　　　　X. Preparing for a New War of Aggression

In addition to turning Japan into an "Asian factory" for American monopoly capital, the above-mentioned US support for Japan is also preparing to use Japan as a base for a new war of aggression. In order to realize its expansionist policy of dominating the world, American imperialists are rebuilding two reactionary strongholds of aggression in the eastern and western hemispheres, one is Germany, and the other is Japan. Just as they did in Germany, they are preserving and preparing to expand Japan's war industry, rebuild Japan's armed forces, and build Japanese military bases, all in preparation for when they launch their envisioned future Third World War, "the Japanese will put on American uniforms and fight alongside the American army." (Quoted from US Congressman Short)

McGowan, the so-called Far East problem authority appointed by the US House Foreign Affairs Committee to investigate the economic situation in the Far East, pointed out in his report on February 29th that Japan is today the fortress of American sympathy and thought in the Far East, and if Japan continues to maintain "reasonable prosperity," it will naturally be a "fortress against communism." Recently, George Kennan, chairman of the US State Department's Policy Planning Committee, openly declared that the United States wants to "build Japan into an anti-Soviet industrial and military base" (according to the March 22nd issue of US Newsweek). This is not a new thing. As early as a year after Japan's surrender, the six members of the US House Military Committee inspection team, "influenced by the soldiers under MacArthur" (according to US Democratic Congressman Sabath), deliberately spread the rumor of a "second Pearl Harbor incident imminent" in Tokyo as an excuse for the United States to make military preparations in the Pacific again. Shortly thereafter, in his speech on September 2nd commemorating the first anniversary of Japan's surrender, MacArthur clamored that "the conflict between Western democracy and 'Soviet imperialism' currently underway in various parts of Asia will directly lead to a new and open undeclared war in Asia," and he hinted that this conflict was intensifying in Japan, China, Korea, as well as the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, Singapore, Burma, Vietnam, India, and other parts of Asia. Therefore, he paid special attention to "Japan's strategic position in this conflict."

Japan has become the vanguard of American reactionaries in suppressing the national democratic movements of Eastern countries and preparing to launch a new world war. The Chinese people remember that, based on fifty years of experience, the first target of Japan's war of aggression was China. American imperialists currently have this intention: to arm and command the Japanese army to come to China to participate in the Chinese civil war, assist Chiang Kai-shek, oppose the People's Liberation Army, and attempt to prevent the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war. To keep China in a semi-colonial state of American imperialism, and to become a semi-colony of Japanese imperialism again. Precisely because of this, the American imperialist's reactionary policy of supporting Japan has been strongly opposed by peace-loving people all over the world and has isolated itself; our people, in this just movement against the American policy of supporting Japan, stand at the forefront of the people of the world.

　　美帝扶日真相（续完）
  　　　　　九、扶助日寇重新侵华
    上述一切美国扶日的措施，其主要结果之一，就是使日本从新侵略中国。事实上日本侵略者在美国帮助下从新侵略中国，已经不仅是一种可能性，在许多方面，是已经见诸行动了。
    在麦克阿瑟的命令之下，蒋政府去年八月一日决定正式恢复中日贸易，允将盐、铁、煤、大豆、桐油等原料供给日本。今年一月间蒋政府驻日代表团与日政府签订了二万吨大豆输日的合同。同时，另一批三万吨的合同也正在商订。我国食盐输日的数字，前年为五十万吨，去年为二十万吨，今年则计划为五十万吨。矿砂的数字，前年为二十万吨，去年数字不明，但去年年底所订之二十五万吨海南岛铁砂，现正在赶运中。依靠着海南岛铁砂为主要原料，日本全国最大的钢铁工厂——八幡钢铁厂——的生产量，逐月提高，而且现在又重开了其第二辗钢厂。麦克阿瑟惟恐海南岛铁砂供应不够，今年四月又给宋子文介绍了朝日工业社社长竹田建吾和太平工业社要员进来要一和冈田源仓，前往海南岛去扩大铁矿的开采。同月，美陆军部民政司长诺斯率领的代表团，经过东京到南京和上海，来拟订如何扩大中日贸易，如何实行“资本美国、工业日本、原料中国”的计划。
    至于由日本的进口货物，除了蒋匪需要的机器、枕木、火车头、车辆、铁轨、炸药等供作内战的与军事有关的物资外，便是棉毛织物、人造丝、纸张、染料、脚踏车、海味等物。据去年七月二十二日天津大公报披露：“日本今年计划输出的第一位纱布及纤维品，占全数之半弱。其次生丝及人造丝，约占四分之一。机器占十分之一。其余便是些陶瓷、玻璃、水产物及药品等。看这些表，正是战前日本输出项目的缩影。是一个轻工业国家对殖民地半殖民地实施经济侵略的武器。……（中国）今后仍将被捆在这个殖民地典型的贸易网里，一筹莫展。”
    关于日货走私的报导，蒋区报纸时有登载，南鲜、台湾、及香港已成为日货走私的三个转运地，由南鲜流入华北，由香港、台湾流入广州、上海，倾销华中、华南各地。日造日用品及棉毛织物多假冒美货商标。真假美货，一同泛滥于我国沿海各大城市。
    一九四六年五月，麦克阿瑟继允许日本南极捕鲸之后，又叫蒋介石与美占领军总部缔结协定，准许日本渔轮四十艘进入中日间的公海捕鱼；于是日本渔船就进一步侵入我领海，年来此种侵略行为层出不穷，仅在最近五月下旬，被蒋政府兵舰中建号发现的一次即有渔轮近二十艘，其深入我领海已有一百五十海里。据五月三日天津新星报译载日本渔船船员原田清一所写的“日本渔船越界捕鱼记”和中央社上海六月一日报导蒋政府缉获日渔轮的消息透露，该项渔轮系炮艇改装，且拥有武器或甚至有炮位，船员则有前日本海军人员，不仅身着军服，且配有“支那事变”的纪念章。但蒋政府的海军部规定，捕获侵入我领海的渔轮仅没收其渔具，人员送还盟总办理，而盟总则从未办理过一次。五月二十六日北平新民报说道：“我们若把专门破坏中国领土主权的日人交给盟总，盟总加以特殊训练，未来这批日人正可以驾轻就熟，成为真刀真枪的海岸登陆先锋。”
    至于我国留日侨胞，仍然没有战胜国国民的地位，被看作是“第三国人”。美国骄纵之下，日本反动政府，取消了我国侨民所应享有的与英美以及其他外国侨民同等的食粮配量给，封闭了三千华侨餐馆，冻结了华侨战前二十亿日圆的存款，使失业侨胞无法回国。日警随意搜查华侨家宅和商店，没收货物之事，且有所闻。所有这一切令人痛心的事实，都得到了美国当局的支持。一九四六年七月，东京涩谷日本警察署的警察，无理驱逐该地台湾侨胞摊贩，并以机枪屠杀，伤亡台胞数十人。美国占领当局不但拒绝惩凶，反令驱逐台胞出境。事后日政府曾对麦克阿瑟总部支持日寇非法暴行的态度，表示谢忱，并决定要加强“非日本人”之“取缔”。
    由于日寇从新侵华的气焰不断受到鼓励，日本议员曾在议会公开要求在琉球、台湾和东北举行公民投票，以决定它们的地位；芦田除向美国要求收回琉球外，并要求台湾之特别移民权。五月十一日东京华文“中日日报”竟然叫嚣“中日两国应当合并”，而自东北撤退之日侨，亦曾口口声声喊道：“二十年后再来”。如果美国扶助日本的行为不被制止，则日寇终有一天将重新发动侵华战争。
    美国帝国主义者扶助日寇牺牲中国的政策，并非自今日始。九一八事变当时美国国务卿史汀生曾标榜所谓“不承认主义”，但事实上，前年美国国务院发表的秘密文件证明，当时美国的政策是“阻止国际对日行动切勿操之过激”，是“反对施用经济制裁”。（据前年六月二十六日大公报）从九一八到太平洋战争前不久的整个时期，美国都以大量物资供给了日本。七七侵华战争中，日本飞机就用美国的汽油和美国废铁制成炸弹，轰炸了中国和平的城市居民。
    　　　　十、准备新的侵略战争
    上述美国扶助日本的种种作为，除了把日本变成美国独占资本的“亚洲工厂”之外，就是准备用日本作为新的侵略战争的基地。为着实现其独霸世界的扩张政策，美国帝国主义者正在东西两半球重建两个侵略的反动堡垒，一是德国，另一个就是日本。象他们在德国所作的一样，他们保存并准备扩大日本的战争工业，重建日本的武装，修建日本的军事基地，为的就是准备当他们发动其心目中的未来第三次世界大战的时候，“日本人将穿起美国军装，与美军并肩作战”。（美众议员萧特语）
    美众院外交委员会所任命的调查远东经济情况之所谓远东问题权威人士麦克格文，二月二十九日在其报告中指出：日本为今日美国在远东之同情心及思想之堡垒，若日本继续保持“合理之繁荣”，则当然为“对抗共产主义之堡垒”。最近美国国务院政策设计委员会主席凯南公然声称美国要“把日本建成反苏的工业和军事基地”（据三月二十二日美国新闻周刊）。这并不是新鲜的事情，早在日本投降还不过一年的时候，美国众院军事委员会考察团的六位委员，因“受麦克阿瑟麾下军人之影响”（美民主党议员萨巴斯语），便故意在东京发出了“第二珍珠港事变一触即发”的谣言，以为美国在太平洋重作军事准备的借口。接着不久，麦克阿瑟在九月二日纪念日本投降一周年的演说中，就叫嚣“目前亚洲各地已在进行中的西方民主主义及‘苏联帝国主义’的冲突，将直接引致亚洲新而公开的未宣布的战争”，并且暗示这种冲突在日本、中国、朝鲜、以及菲律宾、印尼、马来亚、新加坡、缅甸、越南、印度以及亚洲其他地方正在日益加剧，因而他特别提起注意“在此冲突中之日本战略地位”。
    日本是变成美国反动派镇压东方各国民族民主运动和准备发动新的世界大战的先锋了。中国人民都记得，五十年来的经验，日本侵略战争的第一个目标，就是中国。美国帝国主义者目前即已有这种打算，就是武装并指挥日本军队到中国来参加中国内战，援助蒋介石，反对人民解放军，企图阻止中国人民革命战争的胜利。使中国继续保持为美国帝国主义的半殖民地状态，并从新成为日本帝国主义的半殖民地。正因为如此，美国帝国主义的反动的扶日政策，遭到全世界爱好和平的人民的强烈反对而把自己孤立起来；我国人民，在这个反对美国扶日政策的正义运动中，则站在世界人民的前列。（完）
