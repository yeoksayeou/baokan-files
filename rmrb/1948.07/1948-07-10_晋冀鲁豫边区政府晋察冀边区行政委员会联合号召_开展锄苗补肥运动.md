　　Joint Appeal by the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee to Launch a Seedling Weeding and Fertilizer Application Campaign

　　[Our Newspaper's Report] Currently, it is the good time for seedling weeding and fertilizer application. To increase grain production, the two regional governments have jointly issued a notice to all areas to carry out the campaign of weeding three times, applying supplementary fertilizer (milky green manure), and covering green manure. The summary is published as follows:

　　(1) Although the weather was favorable in early spring this year, and the seedlings were growing vigorously, since the beginning of summer, there has been a drought. Because less fertilizer was applied, and most of it was quick-acting fertilizer, the fertilizer effect will have passed by the time of heading, which will affect the harvest and reduce production. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out the campaign of weeding three times and applying supplementary fertilizer (milky green manure). This is the most effective way to increase production. All areas must seize the opportunity, make specific arrangements, and fully utilize various fertilizers. If necessary, agricultural loans can be issued to solve the difficulties of poor farmers in purchasing fertilizers.

　　(2) Last year, due to drought and short grass, less green manure was covered in various areas, with many places reducing by about one-third. This year, the grass is thick, and all areas must do their utmost to mobilize and organize farmers to dig pits at the edge of fields, roadsides, and in pens to ferment manure. If some areas cannot dig pits, they can stack the various weeds into layers of grass and soil on sloping land to turn them into fertilizer. In mountainous areas with a foundation, the amount of green manure covered this year should exceed the achievements of 1944. In plain areas, the green grass used as fuel should be used for covering fertilizer to prepare fertilizer for wheat planting this autumn and next spring. Currently, it is the best season for covering fertilizer, and all areas must give this work an important position, organize and lead it, so as to achieve greater results. The masses should also be vigorously mobilized and organized to help military families who are poor and lack labor to cover fertilizer.

　　(3) If there is any remaining uncultivated land in various areas, the masses should be mobilized to eliminate it under the principle of "whoever plants it, harvests it."

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会联合号召
    开展锄苗补肥运动
    【本报讯】目前正是锄苗、压肥的好时候，两区政府为增产粮食，顷特联合通知各地开展锄三遍、上补肥、压绿肥运动，兹摘要刊载于下：
    （一）今年虽春初风调雨顺，青苗茂盛，入夏以来，则感亢旱，普遍因施肥较少，且多为速效肥料，至抽穗时肥效已过，势将影响丰收，减低产量，故有开展锄三遍、上补肥（奶青）运动之必要。这是增加产量最有效的办法。各地须抓紧时机，具体组织，充分使用各种肥料。于必要时并可发放一部农贷，以解决贫苦农民购买肥料的困难。
    （二）去年因天旱草短，各地压绿肥较少，有许多地方约减少了三分之一。今年草厚，各地要尽大力动员组织农民，于地头、道边、圈里挖坑沤粪。如有的地区不能挖坑，可以就坡地一层草一层土垛起来，使各种杂草变成肥料。山地有基础之地区，今年压绿肥数量要超过一九四四年之成绩；平原地区应将作燃料用之青草，用于压肥，准备好今秋种麦及明春之肥料。目前正是压肥最好的季节，各地须把这一工作提到重要地位，加以组织与领导，务使能获得较大之成绩。对贫苦无劳力之军属，并应大力动员与组织群众，帮助他们压肥。
    （三）各地如尚有残存之熟荒，应在谁种谁收的原则下，发动群众消灭。
