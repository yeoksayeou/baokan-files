North Yue Agricultural and Forestry Department Proposes:
Pay Attention to Protecting Livestock

[This newspaper reported] The North Yue Agricultural and Forestry Department pointed out that in some areas of North Yue, the number of draught cattle is declining rapidly, which should be taken seriously. Livestock is very scarce in various parts of North Yue, and in order to increase production, a large number of purchases need to be added. However, in many areas, the number of livestock has not only not increased, but has decreased instead. There are several reasons for this: (1) During the land reform, some draught animals were transferred from the hands of landlords and rich peasants to the hands of peasants, and peasants bought some more with extra income. Some of these draught animals were not distributed in time and were raised collectively by farmers' associations or draught animal cooperatives. Because individual ownership was not finally determined, some people did not care for and cherish the livestock very much, only caring about using them and not feeding them. Many livestock became thin and sick. Many died as well. According to incomplete statistics, in Changzhen Village, Wutai, one cow, one mule, and eight donkeys died in this way. As for the sick and thin ones, there were still more. In Youzhai, Yujiazhai, Jiren, and Emao villages in Yanggao, one mule, one horse, two cows, and two donkeys also died. (2) In Dingxiang in recent years, the leadership has emphasized large-scale water and dry land mutual aid (villages with water fields plant early and use the livestock from dry lands to help with planting, and when it is time to plant in dry lands, the livestock from water fields come to help). Because the wages for draught animals fixed by the public are very low, the livestock owners are not satisfied and have little interest in raising livestock. Some people rely solely on large-scale water and dry land mutual aid to solve the livestock problem and do not try to add to the numbers by buying (all those that do not adhere to the principles of equal exchange and voluntary combination will inevitably fail – Editor). At the production conference in Lingqiu this April, when discussing the issue of regulating animal power, it was advocated to use the method of “borrowing in spring and returning in autumn” to "mobilize" middle peasants to sell their labor, and if necessary, to use the method of assigning chores to help households solve the problem of spring plowing. In Liujia Village, Yu County, during the spring plowing, middle peasants were forced to organize their livestock into groups, causing some middle peasants to say: "Whoever has grass and fodder can take them to use." (3) Some cooperatives are established by the masses through pooled shares to buy some draught animals, which are hired by poor households and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who are poor and lack labor (the price may be lower). Poor management also affects the preservation and increase of livestock. The Gengniu (耕牛) cooperative in Shanyao Village, Hunyuan County, uses the method of selling cattle to feed cattle (that is, using the money from selling livestock to pay for the food for people and animals), and out of a total of twenty-eight livestock, less than ten are left. The Agricultural and Forestry Department pointed out that the above-mentioned phenomena deserve serious attention and hopes to attract the attention of all parties, immediately take effective steps, and study ways to overcome and solve the problems.

### 北岳农林厅提出  注意保护牲口

　　北岳农林厅提出
    注意保护牲口
    【本报讯】北岳农林厅提出：北岳有些地区，耕牛在迅速灭退，应引起严重注意。北岳各地牲畜很缺，为了增加生产，需要大批增添购买。但不少地区的牲口不但没增加，反而减少了，考察原因有几个：（一）在土改中，有一部耕畜从地主富农手中转移到农民手中，农民们用浮财又购买了一部分。这些耕畜有些没有及时分配，由农会或耕畜合作社集体喂起来。因为个人的所有权没有最后确定，有些人对牲口关心爱护很差，只管使用，不管喂养。有不少牲口瘦了，病了。死的也不少，据不完全的统计，五台长畛村就这样死了牛一头，骡一头，驴八头。至于病的瘦的还有。阳高尤宅、于家寨、集仁、鹅毛等村，也死了骡一头，马一匹，牛两头，驴两头。（二）定襄几年来，领导上强调水旱大变工（水地村庄种的早，把旱地的牲口拉去帮助下种，到旱地下种时，水地的牲口又来帮助），因公定的耕畜工资很低，畜主便不满意，对养牲畜兴趣不大。有些人专靠水旱大变工来解放牲畜问题，也不设法添买（凡属不遵守等价交换，自愿结合原则的，没有不失败的——编者）。灵今年四月生产会议上，谈到调剂畜力的问题，主张用春借秋还的办法“动员”中农出卖畜工，必要时可用派勤务的办法帮管户解决春耕问题。盂县刘家村春耕时，强制中农的牲畜编组，使得有些中农说：“谁有草料谁拉去使吧”。（三）有些社的性质，由群众集股设立，买一部耕畜，由贫苦户及贫苦无劳力军工烈属雇用，价钱可能低些。）管理不善，也影响了牲口的保存与增加。浑源山尧村耕牛社靠卖牛喂牛（就是以卖牲口的款，开支人畜的食用）的办法开支，总共二十八头牲口现已卖的不到十头了。农林厅提出上述这些值得严重注意的现象，希望引起各方面的注意，立即采取有效步骤，研究克服解决的办法。
