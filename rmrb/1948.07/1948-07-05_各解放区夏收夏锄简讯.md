Brief News on Summer Harvest and Summer Hoeing in Various Liberated Areas
    In Jinan, Hejin, Jishan, Xinjiang, Fencheng and other counties, 900,000 mu of wheat fields have been successfully harvested and stored. This year's harvest is better than in previous years. The flatlands can yield five or six "da dou" (each "dou" is 26 jin) per mu, with some yielding as much as one "shi"; even the mountainous areas can yield three or four "dou" per mu. During the wheat harvest, the Jishan County Government transferred more than 120 staff members and 36 mules and horses to the countryside to help military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and widowers and orphans with the harvest.
    During breaks from fighting, a certain artillery company of the East China Liberation Army helped the masses with the wheat harvest, reaping 34 mu in one day. The sickles and other farm tools of the masses in the suburbs of Chengwu County, Luxinan, were looted by the Chiang bandits. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Liberation Army, who were helping with the harvest, pulled the wheat by hand. The medical team and stretcher platoon of a certain unit harvested 20 mu in three hours. The political department of a certain unit stipulated that cadres and odd-job men should help the masses with production for two hours each day. In one afternoon, they threshed the wheat of eight military families in the village and delivered it to their homes.
    This spring, Shandong had sufficient rainfall, and the seedlings were strong and weeds were plentiful. Farmers actively engaged in mutual aid and labor exchange to seize the time for summer hoeing. In the fifth district of Cangshan (new county, southwest of Linyi), Lunnan, most of the 40,000 mu of sorghum had been hoed for the first time by mid-May. In order to solve the problem of food shortages during the summer hoeing season, the Cangshan Democratic Government specially distributed 59,000 jin of river work relief and relief grain; the Dayu district of Mengyin, Luzhong, invested 4.5 million yuan from the government's purchase of firewood and grass into sideline production.
    This year, Jin Sui also has sufficient rainfall, and various places are mobilizing farmers to hoe early, hoe deeply, and hoe often. The local government has prioritized issuing loans of grain to solve the problem of food shortages for farmers during the summer hoeing season. In Ermaying, Beitun, Mafang and other places in Ningwu, farmers have adopted a relay transportation method to solve the problem of food shortages. Each village transports a section, departing before dawn and returning at breakfast, which does not delay weeding and saves travel expenses.

　　各解放区夏收夏锄简讯
    晋南河津、稷山、新绛、汾城等县九十万亩麦田已胜利完成收割入仓。今年收成比往年好，平地每亩可收五、六大斗（每斗二十六斤），多的收到一石；山地每亩也可收三、四斗。麦收时，稷山县政府曾抽调机关人员一百二十多名、骡马三十六头下乡帮助军、烈属和鳏寡孤独收割。
    华东解放军某炮兵连在战斗间隙中，帮助群众麦收，一天收了三十四亩。鲁西南城武县城郊群众的镰刀等农具被蒋匪抢光，帮助收割的解放军某部指战员就用手拔麦。某部卫生队和担架排两个单位三小时就拔了二十亩。某部政治部规定机关干部和杂勤人员每天每人帮助群众生产两小时，他们在一个下午便将驻村八户军属麦子打好，送到家里。
    山东今春雨水充足，苗旺草多，农民纷纷变工互助抓紧夏锄。鲁南苍山（新县，临沂西南）五区四万亩高粱到五月中大部已锄完头遍。为了解决夏锄中的口粮困难，苍山民主政府特发放河工代赈和救济粮五万九千斤；鲁中蒙阴大崮区将政府收购柴草款四百五十万元投入副业生产。
    晋绥今年雨水也很充足，各地正发动农民早锄、深锄、多锄。当地政府已有重点的发放贷粮，解决农民夏锄口粮困难。宁武二马营北屯马坊等地农民为解决口粮，采用接力运输办法，每村运输一段，天不明出发，早饭时返回，既不耽误锄草，又节省路费。
