　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: The Greek Democratic Army is victoriously repelling the largest offensive launched by the royalist fascist army since the start of the civil war. According to a broadcast from the Free Greece Radio on June 23rd, an order issued by the Democratic Army headquarters for operations in the northern Pindus Mountains in western Greece stated: "The royalist fascist army, under the direct command of the American and British aggressors and the head of the American military mission in Greece, General Flournoy, has launched a large-scale offensive in the Grammos Mountains with six divisions. A total of 70,000 enemy troops have been committed to this theater of operations against the Democratic Army. Fierce fighting has continued for eight days. The royalist fascist army has suffered heavy casualties. The heroic soldiers of the Democratic Army, worthy sons of the Greek people fighting for national independence and people's democracy, have demonstrated supreme heroism and self-sacrifice." The order emphasized: This time, the Democratic Army will again shatter the enemy's so-called boast of inevitably destroying the Democratic Army.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: According to a broadcast from the Free Greece Radio on June 26th: In April and May, the Greek Democratic Army killed, wounded, or captured a total of 8,746 enemy troops in eastern, central, and western Macedonia, Thrace, Epirus, Thessaly, Roumelia, and the Morea Peninsula. Furthermore, according to TASS, Truman acknowledged in a report to the US Congress on June 19th that "the situation in Greece remains serious," even though the United States had provided the Athens government with 15,000 tons of military supplies, 2,800 vehicles, 75,000 weapons, and many aircraft. The report also acknowledged that since the start of US "aid," prices in the Athens government-controlled area have actually doubled; "the level of industrial production is now lower than it was at the end of last year."
