Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: According to a United Press dispatch on the 22nd, after a week-long general strike, members of the General Confederation of Labor in Clermont-Ferrand, a city in central France, have reached an agreement with the factory management. According to TASS: 1,100 metalworkers in the port of Marseille, southern France, announced a strike on the 21st and occupied the factory after their demand for wage increases was rejected.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: United Press, Brussels: The Belgian steelworkers' union announced at noon on the 21st that "the six-day general strike has been resolved." The union has ordered the striking workers to return to work. The temporary solution is that workers will receive "merit-based bonuses," which are approximately equal to 3% of the workers' original wages. The original demand of the striking workers was a 5% wage increase. The Belgian General Confederation of Labor held an extraordinary congress on the 20th. The congress passed a resolution with 669,000 votes against 120,000 votes, demanding that the minimum wage for all industries should be increased to the equivalent of 33 US cents per hour, and demanding that the government abolish the "non-military mobilization law" used to force workers to return to work. As for the scheduled national general strike of workers in all industries, the congress decided not to hold it because the steelworkers could obtain satisfactory understanding.

　　法比两国工人罢工获得胜利
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据合众社二十二日电称：在总罢工一星期之后，法国中部城市克勒蒙腓隆总工会的会员，已与厂方获得协议。又据塔斯社消息：法国南部马赛港之金属工人一千一百人，在他们的增资要求被拒绝以后，已于二十一日宣布罢工并占领工厂。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】合众社布鲁塞尔讯：比利时钢铁工人工会于二十一日午后宣布：“六天的总罢工已获解决”，工会已下令罢工工人复工，解决之临时办法为工人将获得“计勤奖金”，此项奖金约等于工人原有工资的百分之三，罢工工人原来的要求是增资百分之五，比利时总工会于二十日曾召开非常代表大会。大会以六十六万九千票对十二万票通过决议，要求各工业部门最低工资应增至每小时相当于美金三角三分之水平，并要求政府取消用以强迫工人复工的“非军事动员法”。至于预定之全国各业工人总罢工，因钢铁工人可获得满意之谅解，代表大会决议不再举行。
