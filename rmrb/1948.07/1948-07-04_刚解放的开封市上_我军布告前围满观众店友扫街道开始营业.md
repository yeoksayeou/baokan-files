　　Newly Liberated Kaifeng City
    Crowds Surround Our Army's Proclamations; Shopkeepers Sweep Streets and Reopen for Business
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 24th Dispatch] (Delayed) A frontline reporter reports on the situation during the liberation of Kaifeng, stating: The reporter entered the southern gate of Kaifeng city from the airport. On the broad, flat airfield stood a transport plane, and nearby were many wrecked fuselages. Looking north from the airport towards Kaifeng city, dense green forests were still emitting plumes of black smoke. The Flour Company building was burned down to its tall skeleton; most of South Gate Street was destroyed; residual smoke remained in the fire zone inside and outside the South Gate. Liberation Army soldiers were assisting groups of residents in pouring water to put out the fire. Red Cross personnel, with towels covering their mouths and cotton stuffed in their nostrils, followed Liberation Army soldiers as they carried the corpses of Chiang's soldiers from the rubble. The area from Zhongshan Road to Madao Street, Gulou Street, and Bookstore Street was originally the city's commercial center, with tall Western-style buildings lining the wide roads, and lush green trees planted along the sidewalks. But now it is a scene of devastation. The Gulou and Madao Street areas were looted and set on fire by the defeated Chiang's troops. The top of the Gulou was burned down by incendiary bombs, and the Commercial Press building was bombed by Chiang's planes, leaving only a shell. And the original most lively place in the city – the Xiangguo Temple, a Song Dynasty building – was bombed, leaving only two stone lions and half a mud Buddha. The continuous frantic bombing by Chiang's planes and the arson and looting by Chiang's bandits before their annihilation in the past few days have caused terrible disasters for the people of Kaifeng.
    On the same day the battle ended, the Liberation Army withdrew to the outskirts of the city, and the city was maintained by pickets wearing red cloth armbands at street corners. Some shops had notices posted outside by the Political Department of the Liberation Army Headquarters: "Owner Absent, Entry Prohibited." Outside, pickets were guarding these unmanned shops. Many merchants had already returned from outside the city with their bags, and their faces showed surprise and joy when they saw this situation. Throughout the major streets and alleys of the city, proclamations of peace and various policy proclamations of the Political Department of the Liberation Army Headquarters were posted, and crowds gathered everywhere. In the evening, the streets became lively, and groups of uniformed male and female students, professors in suits, and merchants flocked to the Weixin Middle School and the two Xinhua bookstores at the south end of Madao Street to buy books and newspapers from the liberated areas and visit the photo exhibition of the People's Revolutionary War. Some shops on Zhongshan Road had already begun to operate. Liberation Army soldiers were carrying water to sprinkle on the dry and sandy roads, and shop assistants were also out sweeping the streets. Streamlined sedans captured by the Liberation Army and American-made ten-wheeled trucks drove continuously across the damp roads, and the crowds coming and going were endless. Although the enemy was still bombing and destroying, order was quickly being restored.

　　刚解放的开封市上
    我军布告前围满观众店友扫街道开始营业
    【新华社开封前线二十四日电】（迟到）前线记者报导开封解放期间的情形称：记者由飞机场进入开封城南关。在广阔平坦的机场上，停着一架运输机，旁边还有很多打烂了的机身。从飞机场北望开封城，密密的绿林中仍在冒起一团团的黑烟。面粉公司大楼已烧得只剩了高大的骨架；南关大街大部被毁；南门内外的火灾区仍有残烟，解放军战士正协助成群居民在泼水施救，红十字会人员嘴巴上包着毛巾、鼻孔里塞上棉花，随着解放军战士从瓦砾堆旁抬走蒋军的尸体。由中山路至马道街、鼓楼街、书店街一带原是全市商业的中心区，宽阔的马路两侧排列着高大的西式建筑，人行道旁栽着青葱的树木。但如今却是疮痍满目。鼓楼和马道街一带横遭溃败的蒋军放火洗劫了，鼓楼顶被燃烧弹烧毁了，商务印书馆大楼被蒋机炸得只剩下了一付残骸。而原来全市最热闹的所在——宋代建筑相国寺，则被炸只剩了两个石狮子和半截泥菩萨。几天来蒋机的连续疯狂。轰炸和蒋匪被歼前的纵火抢劫，已造成了开封人民可怕的灾难。
    解放军在战斗结束的当天，就撤到城外去了，市内由臂上戴着红布的纠察队在街口维持秩序。有些商店门外贴着解放军司令部政治部的告示：“主人不在，禁止入内。”外边并有纠察队员看管着这些无人的店铺，很多商人已背着包袱陆续从城外归来，看见这种情形，脸上都露出惊喜的神色。全城各大街头巷口，遍贴着解放军司令部政治部的安民布告和各项政策的布告，到处都围满了观众。傍晚，马路上喧闹起来，成群的穿着制服的男女学生、穿西装的教授和商人们都涌向维新中学和马道街南头的两处新华书店，购买解放区的书报，参观人民革命战争的照片展览。中山路上有些商店已开始营业，解放军战士挑着水在洒泼干燥多沙的马路，商店伙计也出来打扫街道，被解放军俘获的流线型轿车和美造的十轮大卡车不绝地驶过潮湿的马路，来往的人群川流不息。尽管敌人还在轰炸破坏，秩序却迅速恢复着。
