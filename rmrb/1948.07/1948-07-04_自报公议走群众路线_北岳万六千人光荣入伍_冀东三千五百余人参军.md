[North Yue News] The emancipated peasants and Communist Party members of the North Yue District enthusiastically signed up to join the army. As of the end of April, the number of new soldiers who enlisted has reached more than 16,000. The biggest feature of this conscription movement is the adoption of a self-reporting and public discussion approach, following the mass line for mobilization, which has achieved good results. There have been few instances of coercion or disguised hiring. The quality of the new soldiers is higher than in previous campaigns. Among the 3,064 new soldiers from Wutai, Mengxian, and Yixian counties, 1,073 were Party members, accounting for approximately 32% of the total. When the Xiji Village branch in the first district of Mengxian County held a meeting to discuss joining the army, branch secretary Yang Xiucheng and female Party member Zhao Huani volunteered to sign up their son. On the day of the mass meeting, Yang Xiaolv (Xiucheng's son), Zhang Chenghuai, Zhang Mingquan, and other nine young adults signed up, guaranteeing to the villagers that they would "eliminate the Chiang-Yan army and thoroughly liberate all of China" and requesting to join the Communist Party. After review by the higher-level Party committee, those who were qualified have been approved. Han Yinshuang, a comrade and Party member from Shangshe in the fifth district of Mengxian County, said when he signed up: "The Party led us to liberation, and this Party rectification has further raised our political consciousness. I want to be the first to respond to the Party's call and help the unliberated people to achieve emancipation." When Liu Fengxi, a peasant from Xiabei Tou in Yixian County, sent his son Liu Changyou to join the army, he repeatedly told him: "We come from the old common people, so when you are outside, you must treat the elderly as you would treat your own parents. Every family has men, women, old and young. Don't make mistakes, and learn from the veteran cadres and veteran comrades. This way, you will be worthy of Chairman Mao, and your family will be at ease."

[Report from this newspaper] "Expand the People's Liberation Army, fight to Nanjing, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" The emancipated peasants of Pingding County launched an enthusiastic conscription movement under such magnificent slogans. In three or four days, more than 500 people poured into the People's Liberation Army. Communist Party members and cadres took the lead everywhere, setting an example. At the cadre mobilization meeting, more than 70 Party members and cadres from ten districts signed up to join the army. On the 13th of this month, more than 3,000 men, women, old and young people gathered in the city to give a festive send-off to the heroes who were formally enlisting. Rong Defa, the representative of the new soldiers, addressed the gathering: "The Communist Party has come, and I have risen from a poor man to a new middle peasant. I know clearly who is the savior of the people and who is the enemy of the people. This time I join the army to fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and liberate all the oppressed people in China."

[Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei, 30th] A mass conscription upsurge has swept through areas south of the Beining Railway in Eastern Hebei in the middle of this month. In Leting and Luannan (newly established county, south of Luanxian) counties alone, more than 3,500 people signed up for the army in just over ten days. In Jiatan Village in Leting, 138 people signed up at the same time, and 21 militiamen from Dadian Village collectively enlisted. × Jiang, from Jiangjiaying, said at the send-off meeting for the new soldiers: "My brother was killed by the 'Huo Hui' reactionary landlord. This time, I'm sending my son and second younger brother to join the army to avenge my elder brother." At the conscription meeting in the eighth district of Leting, 900 new soldiers took an oath to bravely and tenaciously annihilate the enemy and fight to liberate the starving and persecuted compatriots in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.
