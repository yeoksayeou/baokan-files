Emergency Mobilization to Combat Drought and Prepare for Famine!

　　Instructions from the North Yue Third Prefectural Committee
    Intensify Seedling Thinning, Prepare for Late Planting, Practice Strict Economy, and Eliminate Pests
    [Zhangjiakou News] The North Yue Third Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued urgent instructions on June 25 regarding combating drought and overcoming famine. Recently, there has been no thorough rain in various areas, and the crops in most dryland areas are showing signs of withering, especially in thin slopes and sandy land, where the drought is becoming serious. Some areas have also suffered from insect, wind, and hail disasters. Apart from the wheat-harvesting areas, the food shortage is still very serious. In order to overcome the current natural disasters, the Prefectural Committee specifically instructs: (1) Intensify seedling thinning. The agricultural proverb says, "A hoe can bring three points of rain." More hoeing can withstand drought. All areas should vigorously organize the masses to quickly finish the first and second rounds of hoeing. The food shortage problem of disaster-stricken households should be solved by mobilizing the masses to help each other, and the government should also quickly issue loans to solve production difficulties. (2) Utilize all possible water conservancy facilities, quickly repair all possible large and small canals, and build water ponds, ensuring that every possible acre is irrigated and every possible plant is watered. (3) Prepare seeds for late-planting crops (buckwheat, sixty-day corn, millet, rapeseed, etc.) to be replanted and rushed after rainfall. (4) Actively develop sideline occupations to increase people's income. Seize the gaps in hoeing to organize women and children to dig medicinal herbs, engage in textile and other sideline production. The leadership should solve the supply of raw materials and the sales of finished products. (5) Practice strict economy, starting with government agencies, organizations, and troops. Call on all staff and commanders and fighters to promote the spirit of sharing weal and woe with the masses, save food to relieve disasters; at the same time, widely publicize among the masses and carry out mass-based economy campaigns. (6) Once there is thorough rain, immediately organize all forces to rush to hoe seedlings and replant. (7) Eliminate insect pests: Drought is prone to insect pests. Currently, insect pests have been found in fruit trees in Laiyuan and Zhuozhou, and in valleys in Wanping. All counties, districts, and villages should conduct thorough inspections and eliminate them immediately upon discovery. (8) After a severe drought, there is bound to be a severe flood. All agricultural gaps must be used to build embankments, repair dams, and dredge ditches to prevent rain from damaging fields and autumn seedlings.
