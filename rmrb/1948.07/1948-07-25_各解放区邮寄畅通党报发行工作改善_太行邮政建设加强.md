【Taihang Electric】 Since the implementation of enterprise management in the Taihang postal service in the autumn of 1946, business has gradually become standardized and developed, and technology has been newly improved through the labor emulation campaign and technical grand competition of last year. The region now has a total of 38 county bureaus, 7 branches and simple bureaus, and 12 postal stations. In addition, 203 agency offices and stamp sales offices have been established in major villages and towns, as well as 35 district postal offices, directly handling mail, parcels, remittances, subscription to newspapers and magazines, and other businesses. The postal trunk lines, branch lines, and county-district lines connecting all parts of the region have reached more than 11,000 li. In order to develop postal services to remote mountain villages and small villages, and to make postal services serve the broad masses of people, a widespread campaign to build rural postal services has been launched this year. In the past few months, with the assistance of the Party, government, and people, more than 65,000 li of rural postal routes have been established, and villagers can directly mail letters in their villages, greatly facilitating farmers' mailing of letters. In order to train specialized postal personnel, a postal vocational school was established, and nearly 400 students have enrolled in the past three years. With the development of transportation, postal tools are also gradually being improved. More than 4,000 li of postal trunk and branch lines are delivered by train, horse-drawn carriage, bicycle, etc., except for a part that is transported by human labor. In handling mail, parcels, remittances, and other businesses, gradually achieve speed, accuracy, and insurance. Recently, in order to adapt to the gradually prosperous industrial and commercial requirements and meet social needs, the remittance limit has been increased to 150,000 yuan to 1,000,000 yuan, and the weight of parcels has been expanded to 40 jin. In terms of postal and remittance services with other liberated areas, in addition to the exchange of remittances and mutual mailing of letters and parcels with the Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji'nan, Taiyue, Beiyue, and Ji'zhong areas last year, registered mail can now also be mutually mailed with the Jin-Sui, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and Ji-Cha-Re areas. Ordinary mail delivery is available in the Northeast, North China, East China, Northwest, and Central Plains regions, except for the liberated areas south of the Yangtze River.

【Another dispatch】Due to the progress of rural postal construction, the distribution of Party newspapers in the rural areas of Taihang has also been improved and developed. In the past, rural postal services in the Taihang area were generally handled by three or five people hired by the district office, and the wages of the postal workers were borne by the masses. Because there was no fixed system, they did not run to the villages regularly. Although the villages subscribed to Party newspapers, they could not see them regularly. Sometimes they received several issues at once, and sometimes they did not receive one for several days. In the past few months, through the efforts of all postal workers and the assistance of the Party, government, and people, the method of hiring people in the district has been abolished, and a number of rural postal routes from the district to the village have been established, and rural postal workers who do not break away from production have been fixed. Each 60 li run earns 5 jin to 6 jin of rice in wages. Each village hires a postal worker to be responsible for receiving, sending, and registering all letters in the village. The establishment and improvement of rural postal routes that run through large and small villages in the region not only greatly saves manpower and reduces the burden on the people, but also speeds up the time by one time compared with before. Books and newspapers from the county to the district in Wu'an can reach the villages on the same day. Rural postal workers are mostly turned-over farmers who voluntarily take on the job. These comrades have high political enthusiasm, automatically expand the distribution of Party newspapers, ensure that every village has newspapers, and ensure that they are distributed as soon as they arrive, without loss or damage, and regularly receive feedback from the masses to improve their work, so that they do not stop in wind or rain. Comrade Song Shousi, a rural postal worker in Huixian, expanded the number of subscribers to the Xinhua Daily and Dazhong Daily by more than 100 in May alone. Some postal workers, in order to overcome the difficulties of illiteracy and fear of sending the wrong items, created a method of stringing and bundling the mail in the order of the delivery villages with a long rope, and unbinding one village at a time. This reduces a lot of errors, and as a result, the distribution volume has greatly increased. In April, more than 39,800 copies of various newspapers were distributed, more than 50% more than in January. The broad masses of people reflected: "It is more convenient than before. In the past, we had to run dozens of li to mail a letter, but now we can do things in our own village, and we can see the newspapers every day."

　　各解放区邮寄畅通党报发行工作改善
  　太行邮政建设加强
    【太行电】太行邮政业务，自一九四六年秋实行企业化以来，经过去年的立功运动及技术大竞赛，业务逐渐走向正规与发展，技术亦有新的提高。全区现共有县局三十八个，支局、简易局七个，邮站十二个，并在各大村镇建立了二百零三个代办所和邮票代售处，及三十五个区邮务所，直接办理邮寄信件、包裹、汇兑、代订书报等业务。贯通全区各地的邮政干线、支线及县区线已达一万一千余里。为使邮务工作发展到偏僻山庄小村，做到邮务为广大人民服务，又于今年开展了普遍的建设乡邮运动。几个月来在党政民协助下，已建立起乡邮六万五千余里，村民在本村可直接寄信，大大便利了农民邮寄信件。为造就邮政业务专门人材而开创邮政职业学校，三年来将近四百多学生入学。随着交通的发展，邮政工具也在逐渐改进。四千余里的邮政干支线，除一部系由人力担运外，余皆由火车、马车、自行车等转递。在办理邮寄信件、包裹、汇兑等业务上，逐渐做到迅速、准确和保险。最近为适应逐渐繁荣的工商业要求，满足社会需要，汇款限额已增至十五万元至一百万元，包裹扩大重量到四十斤。与其他解放区通邮通汇上，除去年已与冀鲁豫、冀南、太岳、北岳、冀中等区通汇并互寄信件、包裹外，现与晋绥、陕甘宁、冀察热等区也能互寄挂号邮件。平件投递除长江以南解放区外，东北、华北、华东、西北、中原等区均已通邮。
    【又电】由于乡邮建设的进步，党报在太行农村的发行也得到改善与发展。太行区过去乡邮一般均由区公所雇三、五人代办，邮工工资由群众负担。因无一定制度，往乡村跑的不经常，各村虽然订了党报，也不能经常看到。有时一下收到好几期，有时好几天收不到一份。最近几个月来，经过邮局全体职工努力与党政民各界协助，取消了区上雇人办法，创立了从区到村的若干乡邮线，固定了不脱离生产的乡村邮工。每跑六十里得工资米五斤到六斤。每村雇一邮务员，负责收发登记全村信件。贯串全区大小村庄的乡村邮线的建立与健全，除大大节省民力，减轻民负外，时间上也比以前加快一倍。武安由县到区的书报，可当天到达各村。乡村邮工多是翻身农民自报担任。这些同志的政治积极性很高，自动扩大党报发行，保证村村有报，并保证随到随发，不遗失、不损坏，经常接收群众意见，改进工作，作到风雨不停。辉县乡邮工宋守思同志，一个人在五月份扩大新华日报与新大众报订户一百多。某些邮工为克服不识字、怕送错的困难，创造出按投递村次序，用一条长绳把邮件串捆起来，到一村解一村的办法。这样减少了很多差错，因之发行数量大大增加。四月份发行各种报纸三万九千八百余份，较一月份超过百分之五十多。广大人民反映说：“可比过去方便了。以前邮信还得跑好几十里，现在本村就能办事，报也能天天看到。”
