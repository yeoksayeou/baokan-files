Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Reports from various sources: The 27th National Congress of the Italian Socialist Party opened in Genoa on June 27th. At this congress, the progressive and conservative factions of the Socialist Party engaged in fierce debate over the issue of an alliance with the Communist Party. Nanni, the party leader, delivered a speech to the congress on the 29th, stating that the policy of the People's Democratic Front is the logical consequence of the entire policy of proletarian unity followed by the Socialist Party since 1943. Nanni pointed out that the congress faced only two paths – either to be with the working class or to oppose the working class. He said that the policy of the International Socialist Conference (Note: This right-wing Socialist conference was held in Vienna last month) completely echoes the US policy of establishing an anti-Soviet Western European alliance, and the result will inevitably lead to war. Nanni emphasized that the Socialist Party must not have anything in common with this policy, because the Socialist Party knows that the existence and security of the Soviet Union is the main and most reliable guarantee of the interests of the working people and the cause of peace. At the congress on the 27th, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party, Basunanni, asked the 600 delegates of the National Congress to vote in favor of continuing the alliance with the Communist Party. He said: We must seriously consider not rashly seeking new solutions. The other path would be to join the reactionary Saragat group (Note: The Saragat faction is a reactionary group that split off from the Socialist Party).

　　巴苏南尼在意社会党全代会上
    主张社共继续合作
    【新华社陕北四日电】各方报导：意大利社会党第二十七届全国代表大会，于六月二十七日在热那亚开幕。在这次大会上，社会党的进步派与保守派围绕着与共产党联盟的问题展开激烈斗争。该党领袖南尼二十九日对大会发表演说称：人民民主阵线的政策，是社会党一九四三年以来所遵循的无产阶级团结的整个政策的逻辑后果。南尼指出，代表大会所面对着的路线只有两条——要就是和工人阶级在一起，要就是反对工人阶级。他说，国际社会党大会（按：这一右翼社会党大会于上月在维也纳举行）的政策，完全是附和美国建立反苏西欧联盟的政策，其结果将是不可避免地要导向战争。南尼着重指出，社会党决不能和这个政策有任何相同之处。因为社会党知道，苏联的存在和安全是劳动人民利益与和平事业的主要和最可靠的保证。社会党总书记巴苏在二十七日的大会上，要求全国大会的六百名代表投票拥护继续和共产党联盟。他说：我们千万要郑重考虑，不要冒昧找寻新方案。另一条道路将是参加反动的萨拉盖特集团（按：萨拉盖特派是社会党里面分裂出去的反动集团）。
