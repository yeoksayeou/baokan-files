Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Amidst the soaring prices in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas in June, the rice-grabbing tide has expanded to Zhenjiang and Hefei, the provincial capitals of Jiangsu and Anhui. Wuxi and Wujin have also experienced second waves of rice riots. According to available information, rice riots have occurred in seven cities in succession in the past half-month. According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 26th: more than ten rice shops in Zhenjiang were looted. A Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 28th reported: hungry people in Hefei seized two rice boats, seizing 300 dan of rice. Rice riots broke out again in Wuxi, and more than 500 dan of rice were looted from rice shops in the suburbs. In Wujin, a rice-producing area, following the riot on the 15th of last month, "poor people gathered to cause disturbances in the rice shops within the county."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. The people in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces have fallen into a desperate situation where they cannot survive under the tyranny of Fu Zuoyi. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao: since the beginning of spring this year, people in the three western counties (referring to areas ruled by Dongsheng County, the Hulimin Office, and the Dalate Training Office) of the Suiyuan Chiang Kai-shek controlled area have been eating grass roots, bone meal, and a local weed called "panglanglang" to stave off hunger, resulting in facial swelling. Being able to eat grass seeds is considered a privilege. Many people have starved to death. The report also stated that residents along the Yellow River near Baotou often sell their daughters for a few liters of rice due to the pressure of life. According to the report: in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas of Chahar Province, "the military grain provided by the peasants, including requisitioned and borrowed grain, has far exceeded the total output, and they even sell livestock, farm tools, and land to pay."
