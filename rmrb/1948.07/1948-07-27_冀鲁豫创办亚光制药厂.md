(Ji-Lu-Yu Electric Dispatch) To supply the pharmaceutical needs of the Party, government, military, and people in this region, the Health Department of the Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region and the Health Bureau of the Administrative Office have jointly established the Yaguang Pharmaceutical Factory. This factory is based on the production section of the former Materials Section of the Health Department, which already has nine years of pharmaceutical experience. In the past, it manufactured native Chinese medicines to replace imported goods, supplying the needs of the war and making a significant contribution to military medicine in this region. Now, it is jointly operated by the Health Department and the Health Bureau, expanding from solely supplying military use to supplying the people of the entire region. The factory has a Chinese and Western Medicine Research Association to study the improvement of product quality. The Research Association held its first meeting on the 7th of this month, studying the preliminary production plan and resolving to additionally hire well-known Chinese and Western medicine doctors to participate as members of the Research Association.

　　冀鲁豫创办亚光制药厂
    【冀鲁豫电】为供应本区党政军民的医药需要，冀鲁豫军区卫生部及行署卫生局合办亚光制药厂。该厂以原卫生部材料科生产股为基础，该生产股已有九年制药经验。过去制造土产中药，代替泊来品，供给了战争的需要，对本区军用医药有很大贡献。现归卫生部与卫生局合办经营，由单纯供给军用扩大为供给全区人民。该厂设有中西医药研究会，研究出品质量的改进。研究会于本月七日召开第一次会议，研究了初步生产计划，议决增聘素著声誉之中西医生参加为该研究会会员。
