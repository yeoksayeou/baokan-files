Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 10th: Another large-scale treasonous and criminal transaction, involving the auctioning of China's sovereignty, has been completed between U.S. imperialism and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government. This transaction is the "Bilateral Agreement" signed in Nanjing on July 3rd by U.S. Ambassador Stuart and Wang Shijie on behalf of the U.S.-Chiang governments, regarding the so-called $275 million "economic aid" portion of the $400 million in U.S. "aid". For a mere $275 million, U.S. imperialists, through the hands of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, have seized supervisory and monopoly power over the financial economy of the Chiang-controlled areas and expanded extraterritorial rights. The U.S.-Chiang agreement includes the following criminal transactions:
	First, the United States has supreme supervisory and decision-making power over U.S. aid funds, materials, and "Chinese currency" (i.e., Chiang currency) equivalent to the value of the U.S. aid goods, thereby supervising and controlling the Chiang side's finances, currency, foreign exchange, trade, and industrial and agricultural production. The agreement stipulates that the Chiang government's "various programs, plans, and measures formulated or adopted to implement the provisions of this agreement" must be decided upon in "consultation" with the U.S. government; the Chiang government must report the usage of U.S. aid to the U.S. government every quarter; the Chiang government must establish a "special account" in the Central Bank and deposit into that "account" an amount of "Chinese currency" equal to the "dollar expenses specified for goods, services, and technical information (including any expenses for processing, storage, transportation, repair, or other services performed as a result)", as well as the net balance after the end of the "relief" funds allocated by the U.S. Congress last October. This currency "may only be disposed of for purposes agreed upon with the government of the United States of America from time to time", thereby controlling the Chiang side's "construction programs or plans", "development" of resources, and "currency and finance"; the "exchange rate" between Chinese currency and the U.S. dollar is to be "agreed upon by the Chinese government and the government of the United States of America" (a U.S. State Department spokesman admitted that this is "a joint decision by China and the United States on the exchange rate"); the "prices" at which U.S. aid goods are sold in the United States must also be "agreed upon" with the U.S. government; even the allocation and price controls of "similar goods purchased and transported to China or produced locally with other funds" are subject to U.S. supervision; the Chiang government must provide the U.S. government with "information on China's economic situation" and "other relevant information required" by the United States government on a regular basis.
	Second, the United States monopolizes and plunders China's industrial and strategic resources with aggressive privileges. "The Chinese government shall facilitate the transfer to the United States of America of materials produced in China which the United States of America requires because of lack or possible lack in its own resources, whether for storage or other purposes"; the Chiang government must also provide the U.S. government with "necessary information" regarding these materials on a regular basis; in order to encourage the "production activities" and "development of new resources" of these materials, it is stipulated that Chinese currency under the "special account" can be used.
	Third, in order to further facilitate the large-scale dumping and blood-sucking of commodities from the United States and various U.S.-occupied areas, as well as South American countries controlled by U.S. capital, the agreement completely deprives China of its tariff sovereignty. The Chiang government "undertakes to exert all practicable efforts to improve commercial relations with other countries" and "reduce public and private barriers to trade with other countries". At the time of the signing of the agreement, a U.S. State Department spokesman blatantly stated: "China must abolish commercial restrictions that American merchants in China are not satisfied with." In another U.S.-Chiang "exchange of letters" published simultaneously with the bilateral agreement, it was specifically stipulated that the Chiang government must grant West Germany and the U.S.-occupied area of Trieste "most-favored-nation treatment" in accordance with the Havana "International Tariff and Trade Agreement". Although the U.S. proposed during the negotiations that the Chiang government should also grant Japan and South Korea "most-favored-nation treatment", it was not explicitly included in the agreement. However, according to a Central News Agency report from Washington on the 3rd, a U.S. State Department spokesman has clearly announced: "China allows the U.S.-occupied areas and Uruguay to receive most-favored-nation treatment," and China's "abolition of commercial restrictions" on the U.S. "also applies" to other countries that have commercial relations with China. From this, it seems that a secret resolution has been reached between the U.S. and Chiang on this matter.
	Fourth, the scope of the U.S. extraterritorial rights in China is further expanded, and China's judicial administration or any other measures are made subservient to the interests of the Americans. The agreement stipulates that the special mission of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration stationed in China, which carries out direct supervision, and its staff members, shall be "deemed to be a part of the Embassy of the United States of America in China and shall enjoy the same privileges and immunities (i.e., inviolability of person and property, tax exemption, and extraterritoriality, etc.) as are enjoyed by the Embassy and its equivalent staff members"; the members and staff of the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation of the U.S. Congress shall also enjoy "corresponding courtesies". There is no limit to the number of such American personnel directly engaged in the invasion of China in the agreement. In addition, it is further stipulated that if any future "measures" by the Chinese side affect the "property or interests" of the American "people", the Americans have the right to submit them to the "International Court of Justice" (established in The Hague, Netherlands in 1922 in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations, now under the United Nations, but actually controlled by the United States) or "any arbitral tribunal agreed upon by both parties (the 'China-U.S. Commercial Arbitration Association', which infringes upon China's judicial sovereignty and serves the interests of American merchants in China, is being actively prepared for establishment)" for adjudication or resolution.
	The "Bilateral Agreement" is valid until June 30, 1950, and the "exchange of letters" is valid until January 1, 1951, both of which far exceed the one-year term of U.S. aid to Chiang. The above facts fully prove that this is an aggressive treaty by U.S. imperialists attempting to enslave China economically for a long time.
	Since Bei Zuyi went to the United States in January this year to conduct "U.S. Aid" negotiations, the Chinese sovereignty expended by the Chiang bandit gang in order to obtain assistance from its American master far exceeds the contents stipulated in the agreement. Chiang Kai-shek has sold China's inland navigation rights, tariff sovereignty, and all industrial, mining, transportation, and port sovereignty in South China to U.S. imperialism. The United States has also acquired increasingly more rights in training the Chiang army and controlling the Chiang navy and air force, as well as the right to arbitrarily send American "advisers" to any department of the Chiang government.
	In addition, negotiations on the establishment of the "China-U.S. Rural Reconstruction Commission" to comprehensively control China's agriculture, and negotiations on the 125 million so-called "military aid" portion, are also underway.

　　又一项大规模卖国罪恶交易
    蒋美签订“双边协定”
    美帝攫取了蒋区财政经济监督垄断权
    【新华社陕北十日电】美帝国主义与卖国贼蒋介石政府之间又完成了一项大规模拍卖中国主权的罪恶交易。这项买卖，即是七月三日在南京山司徒雷登与王世杰代表美蒋政府签订了的，关于美“援”四亿美元中所谓二亿七千五百万美元的“经济援助”部分的“双边协定”。美帝国主义者以区区二亿七千五百万美元的代价，经卖国贼蒋介石之手攫取了蒋管区财政经济的监督垄断权，扩大了治外法权。美蒋协定包括下列各项罪恶买卖条款：第一、美国对于美援款项、物资以及与该项美援货物价值相等之“中国货币”（即蒋币）有最高监督权和决定权，并借以监督和控制蒋方财政、金融、外汇、贸易以及工农业生产。协定规定蒋政府“为实施本协定之规定所拟定或采取之各项方案、计划及措施”须与美政府“协商”决定之；蒋政府须将美援运用情形每季向美政府报告一次；蒋政府须在中央银行立一“特别帐户”，将等于美援“货物、服务及技术情报（包括加工、储藏、运输、修理或因此所为其他服务之任何费用）所指明之美元费用同等数额”之“中国货币”、以及去年十月美国会所拨“救济”款项结束后之纯净结余存入该“帐户”内，该项货币“仅得依其与美利坚合众国政府随时商定之目的予以处置”，借以控制蒋方“建设方案或计划”、资源之“开发”和“币制及财政”；中国货币与美元之“折合率由中国政府与美利坚合众国政府商定之”（美国务院发言人承认这就是“中美双方共同决定外汇率”）；美援货物在美出售之“价格”亦须与美政府“商定”之；甚至对“以其他款项购运中国或当地生产之类似货物”的分配和物价管制，美国亦有参与监督之权利；蒋政府须将“关于中国经济状况之情报”以及美国“所需要之其他有关情报”按时提供美国政府。第二、美国垄断和掠夺中国工业和战略资源的侵略特权。“中国政府对美利坚合众国因其本国资源中缺乏或可能缺乏而需要之中国所产物资移转于美利坚合众国，无论系为储蓄或其他目的，将予以便利”；蒋政府并须按时向美政府提供关于此项物资“所必要之情报”；为鼓励此项物资之“生产活动”及“开发新富源”，规定可动用“特别帐户”下之中国货币。第三、为更便于美国和各美占领区，以及美国资本控制下之南美各国商品大规模来华倾销吸血，协定完全剥夺了中国的关税主权。蒋政府“承允从事一切可行之努力以改善与他国间之商务关系”，“减少与他国间贸易之公私障碍”。协定签订时，美国务院发言人更露骨声称：“在华美商人所不满意之商务限制，中国须予废止”。与双边协定同时发表之另一蒋美“换文”中，特别规定蒋政府须按照哈瓦那“国际关税及贸易协定”给西德和的里雅斯特尔美占区以“最惠国待遇”。美国在谈判中提出之蒋政府对日本及南韩亦须给以“最惠国待遇”一点，虽未明白列入条文中，但据中央社华盛顿三日讯：美国务院发言人已明白宣布：“中国允许予美各占区及乌拉圭以最惠国待遇”，中国对美“商务限制之废止”“亦适用”于与中国有商务关系之其他国家。由此看来，美蒋之间对此似已秘密解决。第四、将美国人在华所享“治外法权”的侵华特权范围更予扩大，并使中国司法行政或任何其他措施都服从于美国人的利益。协定规定驻华执行直接监督的美国经济合作局特别代表团及所属职员须“视为美利坚合众国驻中国大使馆之一部分，俾得享受该大使馆及其同等职员所享受之优例及豁免（按即身体财产不可侵权，免税权及治外法权等）”；美国国会对外经济合作联合委员会之委员及职员，亦享受“相当的礼遇”。而此类直接从事侵略中国的美国人员，协定中并无人数限制。此外，更规定中国方面今后任何“措施”影响美国“人民”之“财产或利益”时，美人有权提交“国际法院”（一九二二年依据国际联盟规约成立于荷兰海牙，现转属联合国，实际上由美国控制）或“经双方相互约定之任何公断法庭（按侵害中国司法主权的服务于在华美国商人利益的‘中美商务公断会’正积极筹建中）裁判或解决”。
    “双边协定”所规定之有效时间为至一九五○年六月三十日止，“换文”之有效时间则系至一九五一年一月一为止，皆远超过美国对蒋援助之一年期限。根据上述事实充分证明：这是美帝国主义者企图在经济上长期奴役中国的一个侵略条约。
    按自今年一月贝祖诒赴美进行“美援”谈判以来，蒋匪帮为了获得美国主子的援助，所支出的中国主权，已远不止于该协定所规定的内容。蒋介石已将中国的内河航行权、关税主权、和华南全部工矿、交通、港口主权出卖给了美帝国主义。美国并已在训练蒋军和控制蒋记海、空军方面取得了日益增多的权利，以及向蒋政府任何部门任意派遣美国“顾问”的权利。
    此外，关于设立用以全面控制中国农业的“中美农村复兴委员会”的谈判，和关于一亿二千五百万所谓“军事援助”部分的谈判，亦在进行中。
