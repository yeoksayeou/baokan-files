　　[This Newspaper] General Branch Reporters' Comprehensive Report on Several Aspects of Production Mutual Aid in the Taihang Region This Year States: Since the Border Region Government's Proclamation Announced That Land in Our Region Has Been Basically Equally Distributed, Feudalism Has Been Eliminated, and in the Future Only Small-Scale Adjustments Will Be Made, the People's Production Enthusiasm Has Increased a Step; and Since the Regional Party Committee Summarized the Region-wide Work of Supplementing, Rectifying, and Democratizing the Party, Emphasizing That: Land Has Been Thoroughly Equally Distributed, Feudalism Has Been Thoroughly Eliminated, and Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Have Obtained Land Equivalent to the Average Amount, the Future Tasks Are to Recuperate and Multiply, Maintain Stability and Unity, and Develop Production, Since the Wheat Harvest, Sowing, and Weeding, Various Regions Have Paid Attention to the Organization and Leadership of Production: Such as Adjusting and Lending Seeds, Farm Tools, and Food Grain, Which Has Resolved Many Difficulties for the Masses; Organizing People to Pull Plows and Seed Drills to Solve Labor Shortages; Mobilizing Women and Other Auxiliary Labor to Solve Manpower Shortages (Such as in Yuanshi and Neiqiu); In Terms of Leadership Style, Many Districts and Villages Have Reviewed and Corrected the Compulsory Commandist Style, Making Production Organization More Solid (Such as in Bazhen Town, Changzhi), and Some Have Begun to Pay Attention to Combining Technical Guidance with the Demands of the Masses (Such as in Pingshun). The Production Enthusiasm of the Masses Has Indeed Increased. These Are All Good Phenomena. However, According to the Production Materials from Various County Offices, There Are Still Some Issues That Need to Be Raised: First, Some Regions Still Focus on Plans and Calls Such As "Complete Wheat Harvesting in Five Days," "Complete Sowing in Six Days," and "Complete Weeding in Ten Days," Etc.; As For How Well It Is Done, How the Masses React, and What Problems Exist, Little Attention Is Paid. Mutual Aid and Labor Exchange Organizations Only Say That Groups Have Been Re-established Voluntarily, How Many Have Been Organized, But Little Is Seen About What Problems Have Been Raised and Solved. Therefore, the Old Compulsory Commandist Style Still Exists in Many Places; For Example, The Issue of Households Without Labor Participating in Mutual Aid in the Issue of Equivalent Value Was Not Completely Resolved for a Long Time, Causing Many Mutual Aid Groups to Collapse. How Was It Resolved This Year? It Is Hardly Mentioned. Gaoyi Says That Households With Labor Were Persuaded To Accept Households Without Labor Into the Group. This One-Sided "Persuasion" Can Easily Lead to Coercion. Pingshun Beiliutan Village Cadres Recently Led the Masses in "Democratic" Discussion and Formulated Seventeen "Democratic" Rules, The First of Which Is: Anyone Who Goes Out to Visit Relatives, Do Odd Jobs, or Conduct Business, Etc., Although Not Using the Road Pass System (The Border Government Has Explicitly Ordered the Abolition of This System), Must Also Inform the Mutual Aid Group, and Violators Will Be Dealt With by All the Peasants in the Village. That Is To Say, If People Think the Money Is Too Little and Are Unwilling to Work in the Group, Want to Go Out to Do Odd Jobs and Earn High Wages, The Group and the Village Can Restrict Them. The Production Newsletter Issued by the Shahe Office Criticized the Leader of the Second Group of Pengnao Village, Saying: "One of His Three Brothers Enlisted in the Army, and There Are Still Two Laborers and One Animal. He Didn't Give Anyone Mutual Aid for a Day." The Comrades in the Office Intentionally or Unintentionally Believe That Anyone With Animals and Labor Must "Help" Others. This Kind of Thinking Is Very Popular Among Many Cadres. The Licheng Office Newsletter Reported That Ren Zhuang, A Labor Hero, Saw an Old Man Without Labor Wasting More Than Four Mu of Land (The Old Man Was Running a Small Shop in the City), So He "Organized a Mutual Aid Team to Plant It For Him." How the Wage Price Was, Not a Word Was Mentioned. Some Cadres Played an Exemplary Role, Afraid That Households Without Labor Would Not Be Able to Plant Their Land, So They Drove Their Own Animals to Plant For Households Without Labor First. The Wage Was Also Not Mentioned. Mutual Aid Has Become Relief, and Not for Relatives or Friends, How Can It Be Voluntary and Lasting? Therefore, In General, Those Who Are Willing to Help Each Other Are Households Without Labor; Those With Labor and Animals Are Unwilling to Help Each Other. How to Solve This Problem? No Successful Experience Has Been Seen This Year. Secondly, The Issue of the Order of Cultivation of Mutual Aid Groups Has Still Not Been Completely Resolved. Peasants in Bazhen Town, Changzhi, Reflect: "The Group Is Too Big, It Can't Rotate, And They Can't Weed Their Own Land." Li Xianshun, A New Middle Peasant in Song Village, Lucheng, Said: "Last Year, The Four Mu of Millet I Planted, I Weeded Half of It and Then Weeded For Others Every Day. The Millet Was Overgrown With Weeds, and No One Weeded For Me. I Moved Around in the Group For Half a Year, And I Couldn't Even Get an Animal; I Wanted To Drive Four Mu of Wheat, and I Told the Group Leader Several Times, But It Was Blindly Planted When the Ground Was Frozen. This Year, The Wheat Is Growing One Hugao (Thumb and Index Finger Open, About Three or Four Inches) High. I Will Never Help Each Other in My Life. This Year, Everyone Takes Care of Themselves, and The Land Was Planted Early." This Year, Some Villages Adopted the Method of Dividing Large Groups Into Small Groups, But Because the Organizational Method Was Not Good, Many People Still Felt That It Was Better to Take Care of Themselves. Some People Believe: "In Those Years of Mutual Aid, The Land Was Not Planted Well, and It Was Not Planted in Time; This Year, Without Mutual Aid, The Land Was Planted Well, and It Was Also Planted In Time, And No Land Was Wasted." These Are Naturally Mostly Reflections of Households With Labor and Cannot Represent Everything. If Mutual Aid Production Is Organized Well, It Will Naturally Be Much More Efficient Than Individual Production. Taihang Has Had Many Villages That Have Proved This Point. However, How to Promote Past Experience, Further Improve and Popularize It, So That All Households Without Labor and With Labor Are Benefited, How Can All Peasants Not Miss the Farming Season, And Do Better and Faster Than Individual Production? Instead of Relying on Compulsory Orders to Maintain Mutual Aid, Experience in This Area Does Need to Be Explored by Various Regions. Finally, Regarding the Methods of "Blitz" and "Competition," Various Regions Combined With Party Rectification This Year to Expose the Mistakes Made in Many Places Last Year. For Example, In Pingshun, a Core Area With No Enemy Concerns, Green Crops Were Harvested Last Year Due to a Blitz Harvest; In Order to Complete the Plan on Time, The Masses Were Forced to Harvest at Night, Wasting a Lot of Grain; Some Even Carried Out Two or Three Weeding Operations in Quick Succession in Order to Compete for Three Weeding Operations, Which Was Actually Equal to One Operation. After Digging Over the Stubble, The Stubble Was Still There; After Weeding, The Weeds Were Still There, All in Order to Let the Cadres Get锦旗(brocade banners). Last Year in Wu'an, In the Competition to Expand Wheat Planting, A Poor Peasant in Zhao Village Could Not Afford to Plant (Could Not Find Animals, And Also Felt That Planting Wheat Would Reduce the Autumn Harvest Next Year, Affecting His Livelihood), And He Did Not Dare Not to Plant, So He Blindly Sowed Some Wheat on Several Mu of Remote Slope Land, And Did Not Apply Manure, Barely Coping With the Cadres. These Mistakes Have Been Reviewed and Corrected in Many Regions This Year, Which Is Good; However, Judging From the Materials of Some Regions, Few New Methods Have Been Seen, And Some Have Even Brought Out the Old Ones Again. These Should Be Checked at Any Time in the Process of Moving Forward, To Correct the Mutual Aid Policy, Resolutely Implement Equivalent Value and Voluntariness, And the Leadership Must Resolutely Abandon the Old Bad Style, And the Production Movement Will Be Promoted Further.

　　总分社记者总述太行互助情况
    各地生产组织领导加强命令作风还须继续肃清
    【本报讯】总分社记者综合报导太行区今年的生产互助存在的几个情况称：自边区政府布告宣布，我区土地已大体平分，封建已经消灭，今后只是较小范围的进行调剂，人民生产情绪即提高一步；而自区党委总结了全区抽补民主整党工作，强调指出：土地已经彻底平分、封建已经彻底消灭、贫雇已得到相当于平均数的土地，今后任务为休养生息，安定团结，发展生产后，麦收下种与锄苗以来，各地则均注意了对生产的组织领导：如调剂借贷种子、农具与食粮解放了群众的不少困难；组织人拉犁耧解决劳力困难；发动妇女及其他辅助劳力解决人力困难（如元氏、内邱等地）；领导作风上，不少区村检讨改正了强迫命令的作风，使生产组织走向巩固（如长治八义镇），有的已开始注意技术指导与群众要求相结合（如平顺），群众生产情绪确已提高，这都是好的现象。但从各县办公室的生产材料看，还有些问题需要提出：第一是若干地区还仍是集中注意于“五天完成麦收”，“六天完成下种”，“十天完成锄苗”等等计划和号召；至于做的好坏，群众反映如何，有些什么问题，反而很少注意。互助变工组织，只是说重新自愿结了组，组织起来多少多少，却很少看见提出来与解决了什么问题。因而不少地方旧的强迫命令作风仍然存在；比如，等价问题中的无劳力户参加互助问题，曾经很长时期没彻底解决，扯得许多互助组垮了台，今年怎样解决的呢？几乎很少提到。高邑说是说服有劳力户，吸收了无劳力户入组，这种单方面的“说服”很容易流于强制。平顺北流滩村干部最近领导群众“民主”讨论，订出十七条“民主”规约，第一条就是：凡出外走亲戚、打忙工、商事等，虽不用路条制度（边府曾明令取消该项制度），也得经过互助组知道，犯者由全村农民处理之。这就是说，人家如果嫌钱少，不愿意在组里做工，想出外打忙工，赚大工钱，组里及村里就能限制。沙河办公室出的生产小报批评彭瑙村二组组长说：“他弟兄三个参军走了一个，还有二个劳力，一个牲口，并没给人家互助一天。”办公室的同志有意无意的认为有牲口有劳力就必须“互助”人家一下。这种思想在不少干部中是很流行的。黎城办公室小报载仁庄劳动英雄看见一个无劳力的老汉荒了四亩多地（老汉在城内开小铺），就“组织互助队给他种上了”。工资代价如何，一字未提。有的干部起模范作用，害怕无劳力户土地种不上，自己就赶着家里牲口先给无劳力户种上。工资也未提。互助成了救济，又非亲友，怎能自愿持久？所以，一般愿互助的都是无劳力户；有劳力、有牲口的则不愿互助。这问题如何解决，今年仍未看到成功的经验。其次，是互助组耕作的次序先后问题，也仍然没有得到彻底解决。长治八义镇农民反映：“组太大，轮不过来，锄不了自己地。”潞城宋村新中农李先顺说：“去年我种的四亩谷，锄了一半就天天给人家锄，谷荒了没人给我锄。在组里动弹了半年，连个牲口也拨不上；想赶四亩麦子，给组长说了好几回，到地冻了才瞎种上，今年麦子长的一虎口（姆指食指撑开，约三、四寸）高。我是一辈子也不再互助啦。今年各顾各，地都早种上了。”今年有些村庄采取大组划小组办法，但由于组织方法不好，仍有许多人觉得不如各顾各好。有些地方群众认为：“那几年互助，种不好地，种不到时节；今年没互助，地种好了，也种到圪节了，又没荒了地。”这些自然大部分都是有劳力户的反映，不能代表全部。互助生产如果组织得好，比个人单独生产当然效率大得多，太行曾经有许多村庄证明此点。但是，如何发扬过去的经验，更加提高，普及，使所有无劳力有劳力户都有利，怎样能使所有农民都不失农时，比个体生产搞得又好又快呢？而不是靠强迫命令来维持互助，这方面的经验确还需要各地发掘。最后是关于“突击”、“竞赛”的方法，今年各地结合整党揭发了去年许多地方的错误作法。比如在毫无敌情顾虑的腹心地区平顺，去年竟有因突击收秋而将青庄稼割了的；为了按期完成计划，逼者群众黑夜割，糟踏许多粮食；有的因竞赛锄三遍而将二、三遍紧接进行，实际还是等于一遍。掘过茬，茬还在；锄过草，草还在，都为了让干部得锦旗。武安去年竞赛扩大种麦，赵庄一个贫农种不起（觅不起牲口，又觉得种了麦明年少收秋，影响生计），又不敢不种，就把好几亩远坡地瞎撒了些麦子，也没上粪，勉强应付干部。这些错误，今年已经有许多地区做了检讨纠正，这是好的；但从若干地区的材料看，新的办法还很少看到，甚至有的又把旧的搬了出来。这些都应在前进中随时检查，端正互助政策，坚决贯彻等价与自愿，领导上一定要坚决抛弃旧的不良作风，生产运动才会推进一步。
