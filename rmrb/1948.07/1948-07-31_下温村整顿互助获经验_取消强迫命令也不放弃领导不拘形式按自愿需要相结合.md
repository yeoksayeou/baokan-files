【Taihang News】After more than a month of rectifying mutual aid since mid-June, Xiawen Village in She County has gained preliminary experience. Since the Great Production Movement in 1944, each street in the village has had mutual aid groups and labor exchange teams. Each street also has a production team leader to uniformly lead the entire street. The village has a production director who uniformly leads the entire village. On the surface, the mutual aid organization and production leadership seem complete and sound, but after careful inspection, it was found that most of them were organized under administrative orders in pursuit of form, which violated the voluntary, equal, and democratic mutual aid policy. This time, under the leadership of the work team in the village, rectification was carried out in accordance with the principles of voluntarism, equality, and democracy.

During the rectification, the work team paid attention to studying the demands of the masses, resolutely changed the complex and troublesome organizational forms that were difficult for the masses to accept in the past, as well as the commanding style of forcing the masses to accept such forms, and criticized the erroneous understanding of some comrades who believed that mutual aid based on kinship was feudal relations. In this way, the masses were truly relied upon for their voluntarism and needs, and they were led to carry out rectification. As a result, the majority of the masses voluntarily joined or withdrew based on the original groups, and thus various forms of mutual aid appeared: there were regular agricultural mutual aid groups; there were temporary mutual aid groups of several people combined for labor exchange; some were combined with certain people during wheat harvesting, and then combined with other people for tobacco and indigo planting in temporary mobile labor exchanges; there were a few more advanced mutual aid groups combining agriculture and sideline occupations, these groups worked the hardest, saving labor in all aspects, squeezing out surplus labor, and collectively renting and planting tobacco and indigo, pressing oil, milling flour, contracting work, etc., so the labor efficiency was the highest, the labor achievements were the greatest, and the masses also felt that "others have methods, they can make money." Some were combined with livestock as the center, mostly poor and newly emerging middle peasants, but also some old middle peasants. Some were a combination of households with labor and livestock, mainly old and newly emerging middle peasants, but also some poor peasants. From the perspective of mutual aid relations, most of the above various forms were formed on the basis of kinship and friendship. Some of them have been exchanging labor since before the War of Resistance against Japan. Under the production mutual aid policy of "organizing" by our party after the war, they have consciously made many improvements and enhancements. Now they also have democratic discussions, arrange life, generally implement equal exchange, have elected team leaders, and are no longer the more primitive mutual aid forms of each minding their own business. The work team and the masses treated the above various forms with the principle that all those organized on the basis of voluntarism and equality, which are conducive to everyone's joint production, are considered good. At the same time, special respect was given to the spontaneous small-scale temporary labor exchange mutual aid organizations of the masses.

Regarding the issues of labor scoring and conversion, equal exchange, and rational organization of labor, judging from the twelve mutual aid groups and labor exchange teams in Xiawen Village, the vast majority of the masses demanded labor mutual aid, labor exchange for labor, and labor repayment for labor; wage exchange was to facilitate the exchange and settlement of labor. Therefore, the masses paid special attention to the scoring of labor. In this regard, in the past, they were afraid of trouble, talked about generosity, did not pay attention to precise calculation, and generally stipulated that male laborers would be worth ten points, and half laborers would be worth five points, which resulted in those with strong labor and good skills suffering losses, reduced labor efficiency, and made it difficult for mutual aid groups to last. However, the conversion methods stipulated by individual groups were too complex and detailed, and the masses disliked the trouble, so they could not last. In general, the masses' demand for conversion is both fair and simple. In terms of labor accounting, the masses also demanded flexibility and rationality; for example, when pulling seedlings, the morning was counted as three "xiangs" (a unit of time), and the afternoon was counted as two "xiangs"; when harvesting wheat, in order to squeeze time to thresh in the morning, some groups changed it to one "xiang" in the early morning, two "xiangs" in the morning, two "xiangs" in the afternoon, and threshing wheat at noon. In terms of democratic leadership and arrangement of life and labor, Zhao Dahuan's group: Li Xiaosan brought two laborers from his family, pulled small seedlings in his own field in the morning, and everyone helped him plant indigo in the afternoon. Li Hanggeng threshed his own grain in the morning and helped plant indigo in the afternoon. The village chief also helped plant indigo in the afternoon after finishing his official business in the morning. Team leaders, Lai Suo, Lan Geng and others, brought the team leader's donkey, the village chief's donkey, Lai Suo's donkey, Lan Geng's donkey, and Xiao San's ox, pulled three plows together, helped plow the land in the morning, and helped Xiao San plant indigo in the afternoon. Such an arrangement of labor and life allowed individuals' small plots of land and scattered work to be completed on time, without delaying collective indigo planting. It was both labor-saving, convenient, and fast, and everyone was satisfied. This kind of practice of combining unified leadership, decentralization, and collective activities according to terrain, labor, living conditions, etc., is the best. Blindly thinking that the more collective activities the better, using many laborers in a small plot of land, wasting labor and not doing a good job of living, is what the masses oppose most. After the rectification, a small number of people did not participate in the mutual aid group; some had already joined the group but then withdrew. They were willing to occasionally exchange labor, feeling that it was easier this way, and that regular mutual aid was too heavy and they couldn't bear it (most of these people were weak in labor); there were also a few households with labor and livestock who were afraid of suffering losses in mutual aid; and there were also some orphans without labor and people who were too selfish and self-interested that everyone was unwilling to accept. The work team followed the principle of voluntarism for these people and allowed them to find their own production methods. The work team believes that in the future, with the correct mutual aid policy and the gradual combination of sideline occupations, those who are afraid of suffering losses and those who are weak in labor may gradually voluntarily join the mutual aid with conditions.

The work team experienced in this period of work that the important issue in rectifying mutual aid in the old liberated areas is to earnestly understand the demands of the masses and grasp the mutual aid policy of voluntarism, equality, and democracy. If one blindly overestimates the organizational foundation of the old liberated areas and attempts to fully establish mutual aid groups all at once, one will inevitably repeat the mistake of coercive orders, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and harming the production enthusiasm of the masses. But it is not to abandon leadership and let it flow freely, but to be good at promoting the benefits of mutual aid in the past in the old liberated areas, and to carry out rectification and even improve mutual aid groups through the farmers' own experience, retaining the good and removing unreasonable methods and rules.

### 下温村整顿互助获经验　取消强迫命令也不放弃领导不拘形式按自愿需要相结合

　　下温村整顿互助获经验
  　取消强迫命令也不放弃领导不拘形式按自愿需要相结合
    【太行讯】涉县下温村经过六月中旬以来一月多的整顿互助，已取得初步经验。该村自一九四四年大生产运动以来，各街均有互助组变工队的组织。每街并设有生产大组长，统一领导全街。村内有生产主任，统一领导全村。表面看来，互助组织与生产领导很完整健全，但经细密检查，发现大部分是在追求形式下用行政命令组织的，是违反自愿等价民主的互助政策的。此次在该村工作组领导下，按照自愿、等价、民主的原则进行了整顿。
    整顿中，工作组注意研究群众要求，坚决改变过去为群众所难于接受的复杂麻烦的组织形式，以及强迫群众接受这种形式的命令作风，并批判了某些同志认为以亲朋关系为基础的互助就是封建关系的错误认识。这样真正依照了群众的自愿与需要，领导群众来进行整顿。结果，群众大多数以原组为基础，纷纷自愿加入或退出，这样互助出现了多种形式：有经常的农业互助组；有临时几个人结合变工的互助组；有的是在割麦时与某些人结合，栽烟栽蓝时又和其他人结合的临时流动变工的互助组；有少数农副业结合的较高级的互助组，这类组起早搭黑干得最有劲，从各方面省工，挤出剩余劳力，集体租栽烟、栽蓝、榨油、磨面、包工做活等，所以劳动效率最高，劳动成绩最大，群众也觉得“人家有办法，能赚钱”。有以牲口为中心结合的，这以贫雇与新中农为多，也有部分老中农。有的是有劳力牲口户互相结合，这以老中农及新中农为主，也有部分贫雇农。从互助关系上看，上述各种形式，大部是以亲戚朋友关系为基础组成的。其中还有从抗战前就变工一直变到现在的。这些组在战后我党“组织起来”的生产互助政策下，已自觉的有了很多改进与提高，现在也民主讨论，安排生活，一般的执行了等价交换，有选举的组长，已经不是各顾各的较原始的互助形式了。工作组和群众对待上述各种形式的方针，是凡按自愿等价组织的，有利大家共同生产的，就都认为是好的。同时特别尊重了群众自发的小型的临时变工性的互助组织。
    关于计工折工、等价交换、合理组织劳力等问题，从下温村十二个互助组、变工队来看，群众绝大部分要求劳力互助，工变工，工还工；工资交换是为便利劳力的交换与结算。因此群众对劳力的评分特别注意。在这方面，过去怕麻烦，讲涵厚，不注意精确计算，笼统的规定男劳力一律顶十分，半劳力顶五分，结果使劳力强、技术好的人吃亏，降低了劳动效率，互助组也难于持久。但有个别组规定的折工办法又太复杂细致，群众都嫌麻烦，结果也不能持久。总的说，群众对折工的要求是既公道，又简便。计工方面，群众也要求灵活又合理；例如拔苗是上午算三晌，下午算二晌；割麦时为要上午挤时间打场，有些组便改为早上一晌，上午二晌，下午二晌，正午碾麦。在民主领导与按排生活劳力上，赵大换组是：李小三带家内两个劳力，上午拔自己地里小苗，下午大家给他互助栽蓝。李恒庚上午自己打场，下午互助种蓝。村长上午办完公，下午也互助种蓝。组长、来锁、兰庚等三人，带上组长驴、村长驴、来锁驴、兰庚驴、和小三牛，合拉三张犁，上午互助突击犁地，下午互助给小三栽蓝。这样的安排劳力与生活，使个人的小块地和零星活均可按时做完，而又不误集体栽蓝。既省工，又方便，又轮的快，大家都满意。这种按照地形、劳力、生活等条件，统一领导，分散与集体活动相结合的做法是最好的。盲目地以为越集体活动越好，一块小地内用上许多劳力，既浪费了劳力，又做不好生活，是群众最反对的。整顿后，有少部分人未参加互助组；有的是已经参加了组而又退出的。他们愿意偶尔变工，觉着这样轻松些，嫌经常互助生活重，受不了（这些人大部是劳力弱）；还有少数是有劳力牲口的户，怕互助起来吃亏；还有一些是无劳力的孤寡和大家不愿要的太自私自利的人。工作组对这些人，均本自愿原则，听其自找生产方式。工作组认为今后在端正互助政策和逐渐结合副业的情况下，怕吃亏的，劳力弱的，都可能有条件的逐渐自愿加入互助。
    工作组在这段工作中体验到，在老区整顿互助的重要问题，是要认真体会群众的要求，掌握自愿等价民主的互助政策。如果盲目的过高估计老区的组织基础，企图一来就全面地把互助组搞起来，必然重复强迫命令的错误，引起群众不满，损害群众的生产情绪。但也不是放弃领导，任其自流，而是要善于发扬老区过去互助的好处，通过农民自身经验，保留好的，去掉不合理的办法规矩，来进行整顿以至提高互助组。
