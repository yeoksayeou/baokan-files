Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 3rd: After the People's Liberation Army announced its temporary withdrawal from Kaifeng, the entire city's residents reluctantly bid them farewell. On Drum Tower Street, countless citizens gathered in front of the announcements with melancholy expressions. To the left of the former Chiang Kai-shek's Central Bank, a group of citizens who were pushed to the back requested those standing in front of the announcements to read them aloud. Everywhere on the streets, PLA cadres and soldiers were saying goodbye to the citizens and asking for their opinions of the PLA. Everywhere, similar answers were heard: "You are truly a good army. No one believes those past propagandas (referring to the Kuomintang's rumors and slanders) anymore. Who has ever seen an army retreat like you?" More than a hundred students, staff members, and shop assistants, covered in sweat, carried their luggage and hurried towards the joint admissions office of various universities in the liberated areas, preparing to move with the People's Liberation Army. The headquarters' political department constantly received letters of thanks. A certain professor from Henan University sent a letter thanking the People's Liberation Army for its relief to him. Two other young people sent letters to Generals Chen Shiqu and Tang Liang, praising and expressing gratitude for the lenient policy adopted by the People's Liberation Army towards their father, who worked in a Kuomintang organization. The letter concluded with: "We believe that the People's Liberation Army will soon return in triumph." With the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the public order patrol team organized by the Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce on the evening of the 25th maintained order in the streets. That night at ten o'clock, when a part of the People's Liberation Army began to withdraw, various colored lanterns were hung on Drum Tower Street, East Gate, and other places, and many shops set out tea in front of their houses. Citizens stood outside in groups cheering and seeing them off, continuously and enthusiastically shouting slogans supporting the People's Liberation Army. Until 8:00 AM on the 26th, when the last of the People's Liberation Army withdrew from the Kaifeng urban area, the city remained orderly.

　　开封市民惜别解放军
    高挂灯火摆着茶水结队欢送相信解放军不久将再度凯旋
    【新华社开封前线三日电】开封解放军布告暂时撤出该城后，全城市民都依依惜别。在鼓楼街，无数市民都以抑郁的神情群集在布告栏前。前蒋记中央银行左旁，有一群被挤落在后面的市民，要求站在布告前的人们大声将布告念给他们听。街头上到处有解放军干部及战士们和市民话别，并征求对解放军的意见。到处都听到相似的回答：“你们真是好队伍，过去那些宣传（按指国民党的造谣污蔑）已经没有人相信了。谁见过象你们这样撤退的军队呢。”百余个学生和机关职员店员，满头大汗，背着行李匆忙的奔向解放区各大学联合招生处，准备随同解放军一起行动。司令部政治部不断收到致谢的信件。河南大学某教授致函感谢解放军对他的救济。另有两个青年致函陈士渠唐亮两将军，颂扬并感激解放军对他们在国民党机关里供职的父亲所采取的宽大政策。该函最后并写着：“我们相信解放军不久就要再度凯旋回来”。在解放军协助下，二十五日晚，开封市商会所组织维持治安的纠察队即在街头维持秩序。当夜十时，解放军一部开始撤退时，鼓楼街、东关等地均高挂着各色灯火，许多商店往宅门前摆着茶水。市民们成群结队的站在门外欢送，人群中连续热烈的高呼着拥护解放军的口号。直至二十六日晨八时，解放军最后撤离开封市区时，市区仍井然有序。
