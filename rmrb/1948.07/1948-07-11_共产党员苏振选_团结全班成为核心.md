　　Communist Party Member Su Zhenxuan
    Unites the Whole Class to Become the Core
    [Frontline News] Comrade Su Zhenxuan, a soldier and Party member of the Third Machine Gun Company of the Asian Department, has become the core of unity for the entire class. When the unit was training in a certain area, two liberated soldiers were added to his class. One of them, named Luo Chengxiang, couldn't endure the hardships when he first arrived and didn't want to work hard. Su would often explain and educate him, clarifying the noble essence and glorious tradition of our army, and clearly pointing out that the Kuomintang had reached its end. At the same time, he showed concern for his life in many ways. Luo said with emotion, "If I don't work hard now, I'll really be letting down Lao Su." Comrade Su Zhenxuan also used this method to transform Liu Peixing, who had attempted to escape, into an activist. After his class leader, Du Furong, fell ill after fighting in Tianzhen, he also had to march. In order to take care of him, Su ran back and forth along the road and stayed up all night, finding doctors and stretchers. Once, he even carried the class leader for two or three li on his back. In every battle, he would always rush to the front to transform the terrain before calling his comrades up. Standing from the standpoint of a Party member, in addition to patiently educating, uniting, and caring for his comrades, he also took the initiative to talk to the deputy class leader, Liu Wengui, in a timely manner regarding mistakes such as making strange remarks and cursing in the street during training, pointing out that continuing like this would affect the whole class. This made the deputy class leader realize his error and become a good cadre. (Han Hua)

　　共产党员苏振选
    团结全班成为核心
    【前线讯】亚洲部机枪三连战士党员苏振选同志，成为全班团结的核心。部队在某地练兵时，他班补充了两名解放战士，内有一名叫罗成祥的，才来时吃不下苦，不想干。苏就经常向他进行解释教育，说明我军高尚本质及光荣传统，明确指出国民党已走到末路。同时多方关心他的生活，罗感动的说：“我要再不好好干，可真对不起老苏。”苏振选同志并用此法转变企图逃亡的刘培兴成为积极分子。他班班长杜福荣打天镇下来后病了，又赶上行军。苏为了照顾他，在路上跑前跑后，整宿整宿不睡，找医生找担架。有次他还背了班长二、三里地。每次战斗中，他都是先跑到前边去改造地形，然后再叫同志们上去。他站在一个党员的立场上，除了对同志耐心教育和团结关心外，对副班长刘文桂在某次练兵时所犯讲怪话骂大街等错误，也及时主动的找副班长谈话，指出他的不对，这样闹下去会影响全班。使副班长觉悟过来，成了一个好干部。（寒华）
