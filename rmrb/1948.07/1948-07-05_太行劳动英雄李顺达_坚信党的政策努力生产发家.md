　　Taihang Labor Hero Li Shunda
    Firmly Believes in the Party's Policies and Strives for Production and Prosperity
    [Taihang News] Taihang Labor Hero Li Shunda (Secretary of the Shadi Zhan Branch in the Second District of Pingshun, from Xigou Natural Village) firmly believes that the Party's policy of developing production will not change. Since the beginning of spring, while many people have experienced ideological turmoil and confusion, he has steadfastly implemented the Party's slogan of "getting rich" and has actively worked to build his household. As a result, his five-year construction plan has been largely completed after two and a half years of effort. Li Shunda originally turned over a new leaf through rent and interest reduction in 1942 and became prosperous during the Great Production Movement in 1944, living a relatively affluent life. By 1946, his family owned two cave dwellings, three earthen houses, fifty mu of land (twenty mu of flat land and thirty mu of hillside land), one donkey, two pigs, and forty sheep. In order to improve his life further, he formulated a five-year construction plan that year, planning to build three western-style houses in 1946, three eastern-style houses in 1947, two sheds in 1948, repair three cave dwellings in 1949, and dig a well and build a millstone in 1950. Within five years, he planned to sew a new quilt for each person, have a full set of clothing, a felt rug for each kang (platform bed), raise eighty sheep, feed a mule, and make two hand-pulled shuttle looms and five double-wheeled spinning wheels. After the plan was formulated, he actively worked towards its implementation. According to a recent inspection, significant progress has been made in two and a half years (from 1946 to June 1948), including the construction of two eastern-style houses, two sheds, a millstone, a well, three hand-pulled shuttle looms, nine double-wheeled spinning wheels, an additional forty sheep, a new quilt for each person, a full set of clothing, and six felt rugs. His construction plan is nearing completion. In agriculture, due to his constant research into techniques, his entire family has purchased improved varieties, engaged in deep plowing and careful cultivation, hoeing and applying manure frequently. As a result, the annual hoeing always exceeds the required amount by several times. In 1946, he achieved a surplus of one after plowing two, and in 1947, he had already achieved a surplus of one after plowing one. In addition to continuing to complete the five-year plan, he has now formulated a new plan to build three more threshing grounds, increase the number of sheep to one hundred, expand agricultural investment, build more embankments, and further increase production. Shunda often says to people, "We are not satisfied with just having enough to eat; we want to have everything we need!" Comrade Li Shunda is also a model for implementing the Party's policies. In leading the entire village in production, in addition to influencing everyone with his own exemplary actions, he often patiently persuades the masses and solves their ideological and practical problems. After the Land Law Outline was issued, the masses were unsure of what to do, which once caused ideological confusion and affected production. Shunda quickly convened a meeting of Party members to explain the Party's policies. He said, "We Party members must believe in the Party's policies and publicize them to the masses, explaining that the Land Law Outline only aims to eliminate feudalism and develop production, and it does not target middle peasants." He also said, "We in Pingshun have already eliminated feudalism, and the poor peasants and hired laborers have turned over a new leaf. There will be no more struggle, so everyone should focus on production." After the Party members separately publicized this policy of the Party, they first stabilized the emotions of the middle peasants. Later, they also publicized the "whoever sows, reaps" announcement in the newspapers, boosting everyone's enthusiasm for production. In rectifying mutual aid, he led everyone to improve the past unreasonable phenomenon of exchanging labor between people and animals, disbanded the large mutual aid groups that were inconvenient to operate, and re-formed small groups under the principle of true democracy and voluntarism, which increased everyone's enthusiasm for mutual aid production. Now, no household in the entire village does not participate in mutual aid. Under the influence of his active engagement in production and continuous publicity and explanation of the Party's policies, the ideological confusion of the masses was quickly overcome, and the enthusiasm for production never slackened, enabling the entire village to sow on time this year, and also to reclaim twenty-one mu of wasteland, earning a lot of money from sideline production during the gaps in agricultural production. He is now leading the masses in hoeing seedlings and harvesting wheat.

　　太行劳动英雄李顺达
    坚信党的政策努力生产发家
    【太行讯】太行劳动英雄李顺达（平顺二区沙地栈支部书记，西沟自然村人），坚信党的发展生产政策不会变更，入春以来，许多群众思想动荡混乱，他仍非常坚定的贯彻执行党所提出的发家致富的口号，积极努力建设家务，使他的五年建设计划，经过两年半的努力，已大部完成。李顺达原是经过一九四二年减租减息翻了身，一九四四年大生产运动中发了家，过着比较富裕的生活，到四六年时，全家有窑二孔、土房三间、土地五十亩（平地二十亩，坡地三十亩），养驴一头，猪两头，羊四十只。为了把时光过的更好，当年他又订出了五年建设计划，准备在一九四六年要盖西平房三间，一九四七年盖东平房三间，一九四八年修厦棚两间，一九四九年修补窑三孔，一九五○年打水井一眼，建碾子一盘，在五年内每人缝新被子一条，有一身长余衣服，每一个炕上铺毡子一领，养羊八十只，再喂骡子一头、做手拉梭织布机两架，双轮纺车五辆。自订出计划后，即积极努力进行建设。据最近检查，二年半时间（一九四六年至四八年六月）已做出了很大成绩，计修起东楼二间，厦棚两间，碾子一盘，水井一眼，手拉梭机三架，双轮纺车九辆，新发展羊四十只，每人做新被子一条，长余衣服一身，毛毡六领，他的建设计划将近全部完成。在农业上由于他经常研究技术，全家已购置改良品种，进行深耕细作，多锄多上粪，结果每年总是超过应锄量几倍以上，一九四六年达到耕二余一，一九四七年则已达到耕一余一了。他除要继续完成五年计划外，现又订出了新的计划，准备再修场房三间，羊发展到一百只，扩大农业投资，多修边垒堰，更增加产量。顺达常常对人说：“我们不光闹的够吃就满足了，要闹的用甚有甚就好了”。李顺达同志又是执行党的政策的模范，他在领导全村生产上，除用自己的模范行动影响大家外，并经常耐心的说服群众，解决群众的思想与实际问题；土地法大纲下来后，群众不摸底，曾一度引起思想混乱，影响着生产，顺达便迅速召开了党员大会，说明党的政策。他说：“我们党员一定要相信党的政策，并向群众宣传党的政策，说明土地法大纲只是消灭封建，目的在于发展生产，是不斗争中农的。”他并说：“我们平顺早已消灭了封建，贫雇都已翻身，不会再来一个斗争，大家应安心生产。”党员分头宣传了党的这一政策后，首先稳定了中农的情绪。后来并宣传了报纸上的“谁种谁收”，发展生产的布告，更鼓起了大家的生产劲头。在整顿互助中，他领导大家改进了过去人畜变工的不合理现象，解散了活动不便的大互助组，在真正民主自愿原则下，又重新结合成小组，提高了大家互助生产的积极性，现在全村无一户不参加互助。在他积极经营生产及不断宣传解释党的政策的影响下，群众的思想混乱很快即被克服下去，生产劲头从未松懈，使全村今年按时下了种，并开荒廿一亩，在农业生产的空隙中搞副业生产赚钱很多。他现在正领导群众进行锄苗麦收。
