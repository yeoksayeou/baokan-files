[Chahar Dispatch] In the vast border areas of western Hebei, the militia armed forces are universally organizing joint defense and implementing the combination of labor and military affairs to smash the Kuomintang-Fu Zuoyi bandit army's burning, killing, and looting, and to protect the masses so they can engage in production with peace of mind. During the enemy's "mopping-up" operation in the Panchiao area of the Fifth District of Wanping in May, the militia of villages such as Wujiapo and Qianjuntai covered the masses' transfer to the mountains, continuing to hoe seedlings without delaying the farming season. The militia also actively laid mines to block the enemy. The militia in the Seventh District once blew up four enemies. In Junyao Village, Fifth District of Liangxiang, the militia and the masses carried out mutual assistance, with the militia responsible for guarding, and the land was all planted by the masses. The masses in Cijia Valley (Front Village) in the Third District did not dare to go back to cultivate the land, so it was all planted by the armed militia. The North and South Shangluo militia in the Third District of Fangshan organized a combat production team, which both guarded and produced, hoeing 150 mu of wheat, 54 mu of corn, irrigating 10 mu of land, planting 21 mu of rice, 5 mu of sweet potatoes, carrying 172 loads of manure, and hauling more than 900 loads of manure. With the militia's protection, the masses in the district largely completed the summer hoeing, and the masses helped with the militia's land and various tasks. Tianjiazhuang, Weizishui, Songgao, and Yubai four villages in the First District of Changping and Wanping formed a joint defense area, using landmines to deter the enemy, so that the masses could engage in production with peace of mind. ×× Village in the Fifth District of Huailai, near the enemy's stronghold, with a total of 73 households, used to support the enemy, spending more than ten dan of millet every month; later, they organized a militia, persisted in armed struggle, implemented the combination of labor and military affairs, protected the masses' production, and eliminated the "maintenance association." The militia joint defense area of Chitu Village in Laiyuan and Zhuozhou, during the wheat protection struggle, took turns on guard duty and production, and immediately fought when there was a situation. In addition to protecting the masses to complete the wheat harvest, the militia of Chitu Village, Bancheng and other four villages, pulled 142 mu of wheat, hoeed 9 mu of land, irrigated 6 mu of land, and contracted to pull 5.5 mu of wheat. During sowing, the militia of Weicun, Xuejiazhuang, East and West Shuibei in the Third District went to the front to be on guard, and the masses who had fled to the mountains rushed back to production. In ten days, they protected the masses to hoe more than 500 mu of land, irrigate more than 2,000 mu of land, sow more than 1,000 mu of land, cultivate more than 1,000 mu of land, fought four times, and wounded and captured six enemies.
