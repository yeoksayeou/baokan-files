[Jidong Frontline, 3rd Dispatch] A frontline reporter reports on the capture of Tang Yisheng, lieutenant general and commander of the police force: At 10:00 AM on June 25th, the People's Liberation Army, attacking Changli, compressed the defending Chiang Kai-shek troops into the southwest corner of the city. Tang Yisheng, commander of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit police force, in desperation, led over a hundred remnant soldiers and his chief of staff, Xue Dichou, in a blind breakout. As soon as they left the city, they were scattered. This 43-year-old, medium-sized, dark and thin "general," gritting his teeth, ran for two "li" (Chinese mile), then could no longer hold on. He completely lost contact with his subordinates, and crawled into a sorghum field, half his head exposed, covered in mud, panting heavily. The second squad of the seventh company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was chasing after them, and squad leader Lan Gongjian approached him with a bayonet, shouting, "Surrender your weapon!" Tang Yisheng immediately turned pale, trembled all over, and curled up on the ground, afraid to move. Squad leader Lan then asked, "Where is your gun?" Tang couldn't speak, and instinctively took out a brand-new American pistol from his waist, and handed it over with a trembling hand. Squad leader Lan, seeing that he didn't look like an ordinary officer, asked, "What is your rank?" Tang didn't answer. He saw that the insignia on his body had been thrown away, and mumbled vaguely, "I am a quartermaster." At this time, the People's Liberation Army soldiers found a lot of silver dollars, opium, and valuable medicines on him, and returned them to him on the spot. Tang Yisheng had a flash of inspiration, and pretending to smile, said, "I have a lot of money here, do you want it?" Our soldiers gave him a stern refusal, and immediately escorted him away from the front line. Arriving at the temporary prisoner of war camp, this "general" was not like his soldiers. In the midst of shock, he didn't forget his status. He didn't sit with his soldiers, but sulked alone, sighing, his eyes red, and he even sadly shed tears. Our instructor, Yu Jinhai, cleverly asked this "quartermaster," "Why did you break out? Was it ordered by your superiors?" Tang carelessly replied, "It was requested by the subordinates. The breakout was a complete mess." As soon as he finished speaking, his face turned red, and he realized that he had revealed his true colors. Instructor Yu pressed him, "What position do you hold?" Tang Yisheng finally admitted his title in a panic. (Jiong)

　　敌交警支队中将司令
    汤毅生被俘经过
    【冀东前线三日电】前线记者报导交警支队中将司令官汤毅生被俘经过称：六月二十五日上午十时，攻击昌黎的人民解放军，将守城蒋军压缩到城西南角，蒋匪交警支队司令官汤毅生，在绝望中带着一百多残兵，和他的参谋长薛涤愁，盲目突围。他们一出城便被打得四零五散。这个四十三岁、中等身材、又黑又瘦的“将军”，咬着牙跑了二里路，便再也不能支持了。他和他的部下完全失去联络，一个人爬在高粱地里，露出半个脑袋，滚了满身泥土，在吁吁地喘气。解放军某部七连二班，这时正越过铁道追上来，班长兰功建端着刺刀向他逼近，喊道：“缴枪！”汤毅生立刻满脸发青，浑身抖索，蜷伏地上，不敢动弹。兰班长又问：“你的枪呢？”汤说不出话，本能的从腰里解下一支崭新的美式手枪，抖着手送了过来。兰班长看他不象一个普通官佐，就问：“你当什么官？”汤不语，他看了看身上的符号已经扔掉，含糊的吱唔道：“我当司务长。”这时，解放军战士从他身上搜出了不少白洋，大烟土和贵重的药品，当场又一一发还他。汤毅生灵机一动，装着笑脸说：“我这里有不少的钱，你们要不要？”我战士给以严正的拒绝，并立即将他押解离开火线。到了临时俘虏收容所，这位“将军”究竟不象他的士兵那样，他在惊魂未定之际仍不忘他的身份，他不和他的士兵们坐在一起，独自闷着头唉声叹气，眼圈发红，竟悲哀的掉下泪来。我教导员于金海巧妙的向这位“司务长”发问：“你为什么突围？是上级叫突围的么？”汤不介意的回答道：“是下边的要求。一突围就突了个乱七八糟。”话音刚落，当即脸色飞红，才知道自己露出马脚。于教导员追问：“你担任什么官职？”汤毅生终于在神情惶惑中承认了他的职衔。（炯）
