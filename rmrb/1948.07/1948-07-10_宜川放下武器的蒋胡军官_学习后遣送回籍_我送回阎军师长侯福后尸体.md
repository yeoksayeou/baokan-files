Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 6th: The 163 Jiang-Hu army officers at the rank of school officer or lieutenant who laid down their weapons in the Yichuan campaign concluded their three-month study on June 11th. Except for those who voluntarily joined the work in the Liberated Areas, the rest were sent back to their hometowns. Shanxi officers received travel expenses on the same day and went home; officers from other provinces were gathered in a certain place and then set off separately.

Furthermore, the corpse of Hou Fujun, commander of the Yan Army's 70th Division, who was killed by our army on the 16th in the southwest of Wenshui, Jinzhong, was placed in a coffin by the People's Liberation Army after the battle and transferred to Fenyang City by residents of Yancun on the 23rd. At the same time, more than 20 wounded Yan army officers who voluntarily returned to Fenyang City were also sent there. However, the Fenyang Yan bandits only accepted Hou Fujun's corpse, and the remaining wounded officers were abandoned outside the city and refused to be received.

    【新华社晋绥六日电】宜川战役放下武器的蒋胡军校尉级军官一百六十三人已于六月十一日结束他们三个月的学习生活，除自愿参加解放区工作者外，其余均送回原籍。山西籍的军官当天即领到旅费回家；外省籍的军官，则集中某地后，分别起程。
    又：六日十六日在晋中文水西南被我击毙的阎军七十师师长侯福俊的尸体，解放军于战斗结束后，即将其装殓，并于二十三日由沿村居民转送汾阳城。同时送去的尚有负伤后自愿回汾阳城的阎军官员二十余人。但汾阳阎匪仅接收侯福俊尸体，其余负伤官员皆被抛弃城外，拒绝接收。
