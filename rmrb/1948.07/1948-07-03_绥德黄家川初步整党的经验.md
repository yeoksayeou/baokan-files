Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: The party rectification experience in Huangjiachuan Village, Suide, the party rectification experience in Pingshan County broadcast on February 27th, and the party rectification experience in the ninth district of Wu'an, Taihang broadcast on April 20th, are all successful party rectification experiences and worthy of learning from. The experience of Huangjiachuan Village in adjusting land was also reported on February 28th and has received attention from various regions. According to a report from our Northwest Branch, after the village's farmers' association completed the land adjustment work, it found during the land boundary survey and determination of land rights that the previous investigation of certain situations was not accurate enough, and the handling of certain land was not appropriate enough. As reported on February 28th, before the adjustment, there were three landlords, 31 poor and hired peasants, five well-to-do middle peasants, and 36 middle peasants in the village. After this investigation, it should be changed to two landlords, one rich peasant, five well-to-do middle peasants, and 33 middle peasants. Also, after the adjustment, one middle peasant privately exchanged two *mu* of land that should have been left for the landlord with one and a half *mu* of middle-grade land that was allocated to him; a landlord's family had three people who fled and did not return, so no land was left for them; individual single men and disabled people were given too much consideration when allocating land; and one middle peasant voluntarily contributed five *mu* of land at the time, but later his family expressed regret. Based on these situations, the village farmers' association made some necessary corrections after discussion with the masses. The per capita output of each class in February was 6.84 *dou* for landlords and rich peasants, 7 to 7.03 *dou* for middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, and 7.6 *dou* for poor and hired peasants. After this correction, it was: 7 *dou* for landlords and rich peasants, 7.25 *dou* to 7.57 *dou* for middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, and 7.04 *dou* for poor and hired peasants. This reduced the amount of land taken from the middle peasants and made it easier for landlords and rich peasants to maintain their livelihoods. After this correction, the farmers' association, in coordination with the township government, issued land certificates, announcing that the land distribution in the village would no longer be changed. Thus, the land reform in the village was finally completed. The party rectification work in the village mentioned in this newsletter was carried out on this basis.

    Since Huangjiachuan Village in Yihe District, Suide, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, completed its preliminary party rectification work, the relationship between party members and the masses has become closer, and a leadership position at the core of the masses has been formed. In the preliminary party rectification process, the village first did three things well: (1) It made the branch public, breaking the mystery of the Party. (2) It promoted inner-party and extra-party democracy, combining party meetings with mass meetings to create better communication between party members and the masses. (3) The number of party members more than doubled, breaking through the narrow circle of the past and strengthening the forces (for many years in the rural areas of northern Shaanxi, very few party members have been developed; some branches have not accepted a new party member for ten years, and all party members have more than ten years of party membership, so it is now very necessary to develop a group of new party members). In this way, the entire old set of coercive orders and monopolistic practices was negated. However, new problems then arose: First, party members did not know how to lead the masses and what to lead the masses to do. Some party members with problems, seeing the strength of the masses in the review process, said: "It will be difficult to be a party member in the future." Some, because their bad styles were negated and they had not learned the new mass style, doubted: "How can we monitor bad people when the masses know every move of the party members?" Second, the masses, just after the end of land reform, had a tendency towards extreme democracy, often requiring even very small things to be resolved by the general assembly. Third, the new party members were relatively serious and cautious in their work and very energetic, but some individual party members were secretly unconvinced. For example, when the old party member Huang Xianghai heard that nearby villages were implementing corrections because they had moved the land and property of middle peasants, he wanted to restore the party in his village to a secret state.

    Based on these situations, the work team immediately helped the branch to start with education, improve them ideologically and politically, strengthen inner-party unity, and help them form a core force. For example, after the victory in Yichuan, they reported the news of our army's victory, talked about the overall situation of the country, the strength of the Party, and the future of the revolution, and then talked about the conditions for being a party member, and even linked it to organizational principles. This kind of party class was sometimes taught by comrades from the work team and sometimes by the branch secretary. The way of teaching sometimes started with reporting the news, sometimes with problems occurring in the township and village, and sometimes by first mobilizing everyone to discuss and solve practical problems, and then linking it to some principles. When a dispute occurred between the old party member Huang Shaoju and the new party member Huang Malu, the group leader first led them to communicate their opinions and clarify the rights and wrongs, and then inspired everyone to discuss the unity of new and old cadres and the unity of the entire Party. When the party member Huang Pengming had a quarrel with the non-party village head, the group leader led them to carry out self-examination, with the individuals making self-criticisms, and finally discussed the relationship between the Party and the masses. With this kind of teaching method, the party members were very enthusiastic about learning, and the masses also loved to listen. In addition to party members, there were always ten or twenty non-party masses participating in each meeting. These non-party masses often helped the party members put forward methods suitable for the village. For example, after completing the lesson on party and mass unity, everyone agreed on three specific measures: (1) When discussing issues related to the masses within the Party, be sure to invite the masses to participate in Party meetings to gather ideas and jointly consult. (2) Party members should adopt the method of making friends, naturally making friends with a group of people around them, listening to their "voices" regularly, leading them in production, and influencing and educating them to follow the Party. Most of the thirteen mutual aid groups in the village are now led by party members. As a result of party members uniting the masses in this way, the factional opposition that originally existed among the masses has also been eliminated invisibly. (3) Each party member is assigned to help with an administrative task and is responsible for doing it well, and regularly reports to the Party. For example, Huang Weihua and Huang Xianqing are responsible for doing a good job in the farmers' association; Huang Xiangui and Huang Xian help with production and disaster relief; Hao Peilian is responsible for women's work; Huang Genzhen is in charge of water conservancy matters; the forces of the Party's activities are distributed in every work link in the village.

    Secondly, the work team guided the branch to specifically help the masses solve difficulties, and thereby established the branch's prestige among the masses. During the spring plowing, the township instructed the village to send seven people to the Yellow River to transport grain. The Party first studied how to successfully complete the task without affecting the production of the masses. As a result, it was agreed to encourage voluntary registration by means of mutual aid and substitute plowing. However, the masses were not used to going out, and some were still worried about life on the road. The Party then decided to send a party member to take the lead and take care of everyone's life on the road. The party member Huang Dengbao had surplus labor and also needed mutual aid, so he volunteered at the mass meeting, which then influenced and promoted the masses to complete the task. After they left, the Party led the mutual aid group to plant summer crops for those who went to transport grain. When they returned, they exceeded the scheduled time on the road, and the Party launched the farmers' association to implement condolences, and mobilized the masses to pay some compensation according to the exceeded date to encourage them. To develop sideline occupations, the Party first mobilized the masses to discuss and promote it, creating a fever. Huang Erwang wanted to make tofu but did not have the capital, so the group discussed and decided that the party member Huang Shaoju would assist him. Huang Chengwen did not have a millstone, so the party member Huang Congsheng lent it to him. In order to encourage everyone to transport coal and salt, the party member Huang Malu went to try it out first, and earned nearly 150,000 yuan in agricultural currency on the first trip, which immediately spread throughout the village. Therefore, the village transported coal thirty times during the spring plowing gap, earning nearly 3.5 million yuan in agricultural currency. The middle peasant Xue Shangtai knew how to dye cloth, and the group decided to help him open a dyeing workshop in the village. So the group divided the work to encourage the individual and persuade the masses to assist. Some people disliked his bad temper and initially disagreed very much, but party members explained the benefits of opening a dyeing workshop to the township and district, and slowly gained the support of the entire village, borrowing more than 3 million agricultural currency of public property, and the dyeing workshop opened. Xue Shangtai and other masses recognized the Communist Party's policy from these concrete facts that helped them, and the party members also had confidence in the mass work.

    In addition, the Party took the initiative to study and solve many problems in the work of the farmers' association and administrative work, so that the Party was closely integrated with the farmers' association and the government. The village is located on the main road, with many errands. The village head and village councilors (i.e., village representatives) were most troubled by the disorder and unfairness of stretcher errands and donkey errands, which affected production. The Party coordinated with the farmers' association to organize everyone to study solutions, and finally agreed to implement work and errand recording, reward the good, criticize the bad, and improve the system. The Party mobilized party members to support this system, and as a result, it was effective and convenient for everyone. After the land reform, the masses' biggest ideological concern was that there were too many malpractices in the previous public grain burden and the disorder and irrationality of the work of giving preferential treatment to military families. The Party proposed to the masses to study and discuss these two issues since last winter. Because the amount of land in the village has not varied greatly since the land reform the year before last, the masses unanimously decided to levy public grain based on the annual output of the land after repeated discussions. The preferential treatment for military families was also studied and decided to be contracted by the substitute farmers according to the annual output of the land, that is, the contractors would hand over grain to the military families according to the annual output, and the excess of the annual output would be owned by the contractors, and the shortfall would be paid by the contractors. This not only guaranteed the lives of the military families but also encouraged the contractors to work hard to produce. These methods and systems were first researched and proposed by the Party organization, which not only enriched the content of Party meetings and gave play to the enthusiasm of party members but also increased the faith of the Party among the masses. Because the Party constantly studies and solves various problems in the masses and in administration, a very close form of cooperation has been established between the Party and administrative organs and mass organizations. Now the best party member in the village, Huang Weihua, is the leader of the Party group and has been elected as the director of the farmers' association. The non-party labor hero Ma Chaofan is the village head and the director of the farmers' association's production and disaster relief committee. Hao Peilian, a production model, is the director of women and the deputy village head. In their actual work, they have naturally established a good coordination system. For example, when the Party holds a meeting to discuss village affairs, it invites the non-party village head to participate, and the village head automatically consults the farmers' association or the Party when there is something to do. In daily activities, the steps of Party cadres and non-Party cadres are coordinated, and mutual examinations are carried out in their work, so the work is very energetic, and a unified leadership core has been formed. The problem of convening a general meeting for very small matters in the past has been corrected. All the Party's propositions and resolutions can be implemented through this core.

　　绥德黄家川初步整党的经验
    新华社编者按：绥德黄家川村的整党经验，与二月廿七日广播的平山县整党经验，及四月二十日广播的太行武安九区整党经验，都是成功的整党经验，值得各地借鉴。黄家川村调剂土地的经验，亦曾于二月二十八日报导，并受到各地的注意。现据本社西北总分社报导，该村农会在调剂土地工作结束不久后进行勘划地界确定地权时，发现前此对于某些情况的调查，还不够确切，某些土地的处理，也还不够适当。如二月二十八日报导，该村在调剂前全村地主三户，贫雇农三十一户，富裕中农五户，中农三十六户。经过这次调查，应改为地主两户，富农一户，富裕中农五户，中农三十三户。又在调剂后有一户中农将应留给地主的两垧土地私自与分给自己的一垧半中地换了；一户地主家中有三人逃亡未归，没有留地；个别光身汉与残废分地时照顾太多；一户中农当时自愿抽地五垧，后来其家人又表后悔。该村农会根据这些情况经过群众讨论后，做了一些必要的修正。各阶层每人所得产量，二月间是地主富农六·八四斗，中农和富裕中农七至七·○三斗，贫雇农七·六斗。这次修正以后是：地主富农七斗，中农和富裕中农七·二五斗至七·五七斗，贫雇农七·○四斗。这样就减少了抽动中农的土地，并使地主富农的生活也容易维持。在此次修正后，农会即协同乡政府颁发了土地证，宣布该村土地分配不再变动。至此该村土地改革乃告最后结束。这篇通讯所说的该村整党工作，就是在这个基础上进行的。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    陕甘宁绥德义合区黄家川村，自完成初步整党工作之后，党员与群众关系已趋密切，并形成了群众核心的领导地位。该村在初步整党过程中，首先做好了三件事：（一）把支部公开，打破了党的神秘状态。（二）发扬了党内外民主，把党的会议与群众会议结合起来，使党员与群众之间通了气。（三）党员发展了一倍以上，冲破了过去狭小的圈子，增强了力量（陕北农村中多年来很少发展党员，有些支部十年来没有接收一个新党员，所有党员都有十年以上的党龄，故现在发展一批新党员，是十分必要）。这样，整个旧的一套强迫命令、包办代替的作风被否定了。但接着产生了新的问题：第一、党员不知道如何领导群众和领导群众作什么。有些有毛病的党员，在审查过程中看见了群众的力量，便说：“今后党员难当了。”有的因为不好的作风被否定，新的群众的作风未学会，怀疑说：“党员一举一动群众都知道，怎能监视坏人呢？”第二、群众在土改刚结束之后，有极端民主的倾向，往往连很小的事都要经由大会解决。第三、新党员工作都比较认真谨慎，很有朝气，但个别党员暗中有点不服。例如老党员黄向海当听说附近村庄因动了中农的土地财产而实行纠偏时，就还想把本村的党恢复秘密状态。
    根据这些情况，工作组即帮助支部从教育着手，从思想上政治上提高他们，加强党内团结，帮助他们形成核心力量。例如宜川大捷后，便从报告我军胜利消息，讲到全国局面、党的力量、革命的前途，继而谈到作党员的条件、乃至联系讲到组织原则等。这种党课，有时由工作组的同志来讲，有时通过支书去讲。上课的方式有时由报告新闻讲起，有时由本乡本村发生的问题讲起，也有时先发动大家讨论，解决实际问题，然后联系到一些原则问题。老党员黄绍举和新党员黄马六发生纠纷，小组长先领导他们沟通意见，弄清是非，然后启发大家讨论新老干部团结问题和全党团结问题。党员黄朋明和非党员的村长闹架，小组长领导他们实行检讨，本人作自我批评，最后讨论到党和群众的关系问题。这样的上课方式，党员学习情绪很高，群众也很爱听。每次开会，除了党员以外，总有一二十个党外群众参加。这些党外群众还常常帮助党员提些适合本村的办法。例如上完党和群众团结这一课后，大家就商定了三项具体办法：（一）党内讨论有关群众的问题一定请群众参加党的会议，集思广益，共同协商。（二）党员采用交朋友的办法，每人自然地在自己周围结交一部分群众，经常听取他们的“呼声”，领导他们生产，影响和教育他们跟着党走。全村十三个变工小组，现在多数由党员带头。党员这样分头团结群众的结果，原来群众中存有派别对立的情形，也无形消除了。（三）每个党员分工帮助一件行政工作，并负责做好，经常向党内汇报。如黄维华、黄宪青负责搞好农会工作；黄宪贵、黄贤帮助生产救灾；郝培莲负责妇女工作；黄跟珍掌管水利事情；全村每一个工作环节上，都分布有党的活动力量。
    其次工作组又引导支部具体帮助群众解决困难，并由此建立了支部在群众中的威信。春耕中，乡上指示要本村派七个人去黄河边运粮食，党内即先研究如何胜利完成任务，同时又不致影响群众生产，结果商定以变工和代耕的办法鼓励自愿报名。但群众没有外出习惯，有的对路上的生活还有顾虑，党内又决定派一个党员去带头，并在路上关照大家生活。党员黄登保劳动力有长余，也需要变工，即由他在群众大会上自告奋勇，接着影响推动群众，完成了任务。他们走后，党又领导变工小组分别把去运粮者的夏田种上了。他们返回时路上超过了预定时间，党又发动农会实行慰劳，按超过日期，发动群众付给一些代价，以资鼓励。发展副业，产时，党先发动群众酝酿座谈，宣传解说，造成热潮。黄二旺想做豆腐，没有本钱，小组商议由党员黄绍举资助他。黄成文没有磨子，由党员黄从圣借给他。为了鼓励大家运炭、运盐、由党员黄马六先去试运，第一回就赚到将及农币十五万元，全村人立即都传开了。因此该村在春耕空隙中，单是炭就贩了三十回，挣农币将及三百五十多万元。中农薛尚台会染布，小组会决定要帮助他在本村开染坊，于是小组分工去鼓励本人、劝说群众资助，一部分人嫌他脾气不好，开头很不同意，党员则分别解释开染坊对本乡本区的好处，慢慢地取得了全村群众拥护，借出三百多万农币的公共财物，染坊便开张了。薛尚台和其他群众从这些具体扶助他们的事实中，认识了共产党的政策，党员对群众工作也有了信心。
    此外，党又主动研究解决农会工作和行政工作的许多问题，使党与农会和政府密切地结合了起来。该村位居大路，差务繁多，村长和村议员（即村代表）最感头痛的事是担架支差和毛驴支差的零乱和不公，以致影响生产。党内即协同农会组织大家研究办法，最后商定实行记工记差，奖励好的，批评坏的，健全制度。党内又动员党员支持这一制度，结果行之有效，人人称便。土改之后，群众在思想上最顾虑的，是以往公粮负担弊端太多，和优待军属工作的紊乱不合理。对于这两个问题，党从去冬即在群众中提出酝酿研究。因为该村自前年土改后土地数量悬殊不大，群众在反复讨论后，一致决定按土地常年产量计征公粮。对军属优待，亦经过研究，决定按土地常年产量由代耕人实行包耕，即由包耕者按常年产量交粮给军属，收粮超过常年产量时归包耕者所得，不足时由包工者垫给。这样既保证了军属生活，且鼓励了包耕者努力生产。这些办法和制度，都先由党内组织研究提出，不仅充实了党的会议内容，发挥了党员积极性，而且提高了党在群众中的信仰。由于党不断地研究解决群众中和行政中的各种问题，党与行政机关和群众团体之间，建立了一种很密切的合作形式。现在该村最好的党员黄维华是党的小组长，又被选为农会主任，非党劳动英雄马超凡是村长，又是农会生产救灾委员会主任；生产模范郝培莲是妇女主任，又是副村长。他们在实际工作中，很自然地树立了一种良好的配合制度。例如党内开会讨论村内事情，即请非党村长参加，村长有事自动找农会或党商量。在日常的活动中，党的干部与非党的干部步骤协调，加以在工作中相互检讨，因而工作都很起劲，已形成一个统一的领导核心。过去遇着很小的事情都要召开大会的毛病纠正了。党的一切主张、决议，经过这个核心都可以贯彻下去。
