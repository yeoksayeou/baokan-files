　　Celebrating the Five-Route Great Victory
    Amid a series of exciting victories, the People's Liberation Army is marching forward victoriously into the third year of the Liberation War. Our army has won great victories in the Central Plains, North China, and East China battlefields.
    The Kaifeng and Suiqi victories in Henan, Central Plains, are strategically significant victories for our army in the Central Plains Liberated Area in recent times. These two campaigns lasted a month, eliminating nearly 100,000 enemy troops, briefly liberating Kaifeng, the capital of Henan Province, and capturing alive Chiang Kai-shek's army corps commander Qu Shounian and Shen Chengnian, commander of the reorganized 75th Division.
    The Xiangfan victory eliminated more than 20,000 enemy troops, captured alive the notorious special agent bandit leader Kang Ze, commander of the 15th Pacification Zone, and deputy commander Guo Xunqi, and controlled the central section of the Han River. This is another brilliant victory for our army in the Central Plains recently.
    In the Jinzhong area, our North China People's Liberation Army attacked the Taiyuan area. Over the past month, it has annihilated a group army headquarters, five army headquarters, more than nine divisions, and two brigades of Yan Xishan's bandit army, liberating all areas outside Taiyuan, and capturing alive group army commander Zhao Chengshou, 33rd Army commander Shen Rui, and many division commanders. Our army's progress is as swift as autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. Now the remnants of Yan's bandits have shrunk to the isolated city of Taiyuan, and the liberation of Shanxi's capital and the complete annihilation of Yan Xishan's bandit army are not far away.
    In the areas surrounding Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding, another corps of our North China People's Liberation Army and a part of the Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning People's Liberation Army have conducted continuous operations for fifty days. First, in the eastern Hebei area, they attacked and occupied Fengrun, destroyed the Pinggu line, captured Changli, and annihilated the 8th and 5th Brigades of the traffic police, totaling 13,000 enemy troops. Then another part of our army fought between Beiping and Baoding, annihilating the Provisional 31st Division, sweeping away the bandit Wang Fenggang's lair, and cutting off the transportation between Beiping and Baoding, isolating Baoding, the capital of Hebei Province.
    Our East China army, starting from the Changtan campaign, carried out continuous operations on the Jiaoji and Jinpu lines and in northern Jiangsu for more than two months, eliminating over 100,000 enemy troops and liberating eighteen cities. In the battle to capture the strategic location of Yanzhou, Huo Shouyi, commander of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 12th Army, was captured alive, and the reorganized 84th Division of the traitor Wu Huawen's army was largely annihilated in the Dawenkou battle. Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, has been completely isolated. Xuzhou, one of Chiang Kai-shek's important military bases, has become one of the foremost front-line cities.
    This series of great victories has undoubtedly dealt another extremely serious blow to the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang, further placing its overall strategy in a passive position and creating more favorable conditions for the People's Liberation Army's future victories on all battlefields.
    This series of great victories tells us that Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic guidance is completely correct and the only victorious strategic policy. All reactionaries, whether it is Chiang Kai-shek's "overall offensive" or "key offensive," or his "overall defense" or "key defense," whether it is Fu Zuoyi's "main force against main force," "penetrating tactics," or Bai Chongxi's "offensive defense," are inevitably doomed to failure. After suffering multiple defeats, the Kuomintang reactionaries' last trump card to deal with the People's Liberation Army is to rely on their solid defense zones and fortified cities to protect themselves, believing that the People's Liberation Army could not possibly capture their solid defense zones and cities. However, after the People's Liberation Army seized thousands of enemy cannons in the war, it established a powerful people's artillery force. From then on, the People's Liberation Army is not only invincible in mobile field warfare, but also invincible in positional warfare. Over the past year, we have captured solid defense zones and fortified cities such as Shijiazhuang, Yuncheng, Linfen, Baoji, Weixian, Yanzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xiangyang, Liaoyang, Anshan, and Sipingjie. This shows that the People's Liberation Army's tactics, especially siege tactics, have made significant progress. Therefore, there are no more Kuomintang fortified cities that cannot be opened. This will naturally shock American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang, because their last trump card for self-preservation is also completely useless. However, this new situation only emerged after American imperialism supplied the People's Liberation Army with a large number of cannons. Now, American imperialism is still supplying the Kuomintang reactionaries with guns and cannons in large quantities, showing that it is willing to continue to serve as our army's transportation team.
    Our army has not only won great victories militarily, but also continued to win great victories politically. That is, the correct policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have been truly implemented consistently from top to bottom in the People's Liberation Army. The excellent discipline and correct policy implementation demonstrated by our army in Kaifeng this time is one example. This shows that the political quality of our army has further improved. Our army has deeply won the hearts of the people and received the sincere support of all anti-American and anti-Chiang people. Chiang's bandits have lost the hearts of the people and are hated by all the people. This is the fundamental reason why Chiang's army is bound to be defeated and our army is bound to win. It is of extreme importance to correctly continue carrying out the new-style military rectification, and to constantly improve the political consciousness of our army's officers and soldiers, rectify discipline, and implement policy education.
    As the Liberation War enters its third year, north of the Yellow River, the enemy has only a few scattered strongholds besides the PingSui and PingJin railways and the towns on these two lines, such as Shenyang, Changchun, Chengde, Baoding, Taiyuan, Anyang, Xinxiang, and Jiaozuo. In this vast and rich area, the day of completely and thoroughly eliminating the Kuomintang bandit army is not far away. The situation in which the four major liberated areas of Northeast, North China, Northwest, and East China are completely connected will be realized. South of the Yellow River, the strength of the People's Liberation Army has grown greatly in the past year. The Shandong and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Areas have exceeded their pre-war scale; the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, Western Henan, Southern Shaanxi, Tongbai, Jianghan, Northern Jiangsu, and Central Jiangsu Liberated Areas are all developing or recovering; the Jianghuai Military Region has been established, and the Dabie Mountain guerrilla warfare is persisting. The situation on the Central Plains battlefield has long been unfavorable to Chiang Kai-shek.
    In this battle of Henan, Chiang Kai-shek guaranteed to the puppet Legislative Yuan that Kaifeng would never be lost and personally directed the battle in the skies over Kaifeng. However, Kaifeng was liberated by our army. When Chiang's bandit troops rushed to Kaifeng, before they could catch their breath, our army captured his corps commander alive in the Sui County and Qi County area, captured Yanzhou in the east, and captured Xiangyang in the south. Now, Jinan and Xuzhou are again in critical condition. Two days before Chiang Kai-shek became the puppet president, on April 9th, he made a promise to his group of lackeys, the so-called National Assembly representatives, saying that he would definitely be able to eliminate the Central Plains People's Liberation Army within three to six months. Three months have already passed, and we see that those who have been eliminated are Chiang Kai-shek's beloved special agent bandit leader Kang Ze, his corps commander Qu Shounian, and so on. There are less than three months left until the six months are up, and we will see who eliminates whom.
    The great victory at the beginning of the third year of the war and its heavy blow to the Kuomintang reactionary rule and American imperialism have led the American imperialists to once again address Chiang Kai-shek, this slave, by name, reprimanding him and threatening to kick him out; they are even willing to risk having Chiang Kai-shek step down and go abroad, allowing other military politicians who pretend to be anti-Chiang, anti-civil war, and anti-dictatorship to carry out a sham peace conspiracy, in order to gain a chance to breathe, reorganize their forces, and make a comeback. But the People's Liberation Army is advancing victoriously, and the Chinese people have realized that without thoroughly overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary rule and driving out the aggressive forces of American imperialism, there will be no real and lasting peace in China. Those who do not truly oppose American imperialism's aggression against China will not truly oppose Chiang, oppose the civil war, or oppose dictatorship, and there will be no true democracy or true peace. Therefore, the conspiracy of American imperialism will still not be able to save the precarious fate of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Now, the Kuomintang reactionaries inside are like a group of pirates on a sinking ship, cursing each other, fighting each other, and desperately grabbing what they think can save their lives. In the Henan campaign, Chiang Kai-shek fabricated so-called "great victory" news to his master and subordinates in an attempt to deceive them. Chiang Kai-shek has always talked about the "joint responsibility system." This time in the Henan campaign, Chiang Kai-shek personally directed the battle, losing 100,000 troops, failing to defend Kaifeng, and causing the fall of Yanzhou and Xiangyang. The person directly responsible is Chiang Kai-shek himself, so he can only talk about "victory" and can only call the 75th Division, which was completely and thoroughly annihilated, the most meritorious unit. He cannot talk about the "joint responsibility system." Chiang Kai-shek has to adopt such deceptive means towards his master and subordinates, which shows that Chiang Kai-shek's evil rule has reached the brink of final collapse.
    The People's Liberation Army has unveiled the prelude to the third year of the Liberation War with a great victory. We warmly celebrate these victories and wish for even greater victories in the future. All anti-communist and anti-people reactionary forces are bound to fail, and the people's power is bound to win. Let the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries know that China will be China of the Chinese people and will never allow any aggressors and reactionaries to hide filth and commit crimes on this land.

　　祝五路大捷
    在一连串兴奋人心的大捷声中，人民解放军迈着雄壮的步伐，胜利地跨进解放战争的第三年。在中原、华北和华东战场上，我军都打了大胜仗。
    豫东开封、睢杞两次大捷，是最近时期我军在中原解放区内的具有战略意义的大胜利。这两个战役经过一个月，歼灭敌人有生力量近十万人，一度解放河南省会开封，活捉蒋匪兵团司令区寿年及整编七十五师师长沈澄年。
    襄樊之捷，歼敌两万余人，活捉著名的特务匪首第十五绥靖区司令康泽及副司令郭勋祺，控制了汉水中段。这是中原我军最近又一辉煌的胜利。
    晋中地区我华北人民解放军进攻太原区，一个多月来，歼灭阎锡山匪军一个集团军司令部、五个军司令部、九个多师、两个总队，解放了太原以外的一切地方，活捉集团军总司令赵承绶、第三十三军军长沈瑞及许多师长，我军进展之速，有如秋风扫落叶。现阎匪残余，已缩守太原孤城，山西省会的解放，与阎锡山匪军的彻底消灭，已经不远了。
    在平津保周围地区，我华北人民解放军另一兵团与冀察热辽人民解放军一部，五十天来进行了连续的作战，先在冀东地区，袭占丰润，破击平古线，攻克昌黎，歼敌交警第八总队第五总队等部一万三千人，然后我另一部又在北平保定之间作战，歼敌暂编三十一师，扫荡土匪王凤岗的巢穴，切断了北平与保定间的交通，使河北省会保定陷于孤立。
    华东我军，从昌滩战役起，在胶济津浦两线及在苏北进行了两个多月的连续作战，歼敌十万以上，解放城市十八座。在攻克战略要地兖州之战中，活捉蒋匪整编第十二军军长霍守义，并在大汶口战斗中大部歼灭汉奸吴化文部整编八十四师，山东省会济南城已经完全孤立。蒋匪重要军事基地之一的徐州，则已变为最前线的城市之一。
    这一连串的大胜利，无疑的，又给了美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党的反动统治以极为严重的打击，使它的全盘战略更加陷于被动，并为人民解放军今后在一切战场上的胜利创造了更有利的条件。
    这一连串的大胜利，告诉我们：毛泽东同志的战略指导，是完全正确的，是唯一的胜利的战略方针。一切反动派，不论是蒋介石的“全面进攻”或“重点进攻”，也不论是他的“全面防御”或“重点防御”，不论是傅作义的“主力对主力”、“穿心战术”，不论是白崇禧的“攻势防御”，都是不可避免地要失败的。国民党反动派在受到多次的失败之后，赖以对付人民解放军的最后一张王牌，就是依靠他们坚固的设防地带与设防城市以自保，他们以为人民解放军无论如何也不能攻克他们坚固的设防地带和城市。然而，人民解放军在战争中夺取了敌人成千门的大炮之后，就建立了具有强大威力的人民的炮兵，从此，人民解放军不独在运动的野战中是无敌的，就是在阵地战中也是无敌的了。一年来我们攻克了石家庄、运城、临汾、宝鸡、潍县、兖州、洛阳、开封、襄阳、辽阳、鞍山、四平街等坚固的设防地带与设防城市。这就表现了人民解放军的战术，特别是攻坚战术，有了长足的进步。因此，已经没有什么国民党的设防城市打不开的了。这自然要使美国帝国主义及国民党匪帮震惊失色，因为他们最后赖以自保的一张王牌也完全无用了。然而，这只是美国帝国主义及国民党反动派供给了人民解放军大批大炮之后，才出现了这一新的情况的。现在，美帝国主义仍在大批供给国民党反动派以枪炮，可见它是愿意继续担任我军运输队的任务了。
    我军不仅在军事上打了大胜仗，并且在政治上也继续地打了大胜仗，这就是，中共中央的正确政策，真正在人民解放军中上下一致地贯彻执行了。此次我军在开封所表现的优良纪律与正确的政策实施，就是一个例子。这说明了我军政治质量有更进一步的提高。我军深得民心，受到一切反美反蒋人民的衷心拥护，蒋匪失了民心，受到所有人民的痛恨，这是蒋军必败我军必胜的根本原因。正确地继续进行新式整军，时刻不懈地提高我军将士的政治觉悟，整饬纪律，贯彻政策教育，是有极重要意义的工作。
    解放战争进入第三年的时候，敌人在黄河以北，除了平绥、平锦两条铁路及在这两条路上的城镇外，只有沈阳、长春、承德、保定、太原、安阳、新乡、焦作等稀稀落落的几个据点了。在这个广大而富庶的地区内，干净彻底全部消灭国民党匪军的日子，已经不远。东北、华北、西北、华东四个大解放区之间完全打成一片的局面，将要实现了。黄河以南，人民解放军的力量一年来有很大的生长。山东和陕甘宁解放区超过了战前的规模；豫皖苏、豫西、陕南、桐柏、江汉、苏北、苏中各解放区都在发展或恢复之中；江淮军区已经建立，大别山游击战争正在坚持。中原战场上的形势，早已不利于蒋介石了。
    此次豫东大战，蒋介石对伪立法院保证开封决不会丢，亲自到开封上空指挥作战，然而开封竟被我军解放。蒋匪军队赶到开封，喘息未定，我军又在睢县杞县地区活捉他的兵团司令，在东边打下兖州，在南边打下襄阳，现在，济南与徐州又在告急。蒋介石充当伪总统的前两天即四月九日，曾经对他的一群猪仔所谓国大代表发出诺言，说他一定可以在三个月到六个月的时间内肃清中原人民解放军。三个月早已过去了，我们看见被肃清的是蒋介石所宠爱的特务匪首康泽，是他的兵团司令区寿年等等。还有不到三个月的时间就要满六个月，我们倒要看一看究竟谁肃清谁。
    战争第三年开始时的巨大胜利及其对于国民党反动统治与美国帝国主义的沉重打击，使美国帝国主义者，对于蒋介石这个奴才，再次直呼其名，加以呵斥，并威吓着要他滚蛋；甚至不惜冒险地准备要蒋介石下野出洋，让其他伪装反蒋反内战反独裁的军人政客，来进行假和平的阴谋，以图能取得喘息机会，重整兵力，卷土重来。但人民解放军正在胜利前进，中国人民已经觉悟到不彻底推翻国民党反动统治，不赶走美帝国主义的侵略势力，中国是没有真正的永久的和平可言的。凡不真正反对美帝国主义侵略中国的，就不会真正反蒋，反内战反独裁，也不会有真民主，真和平。故美帝国主义的阴谋，仍将不能挽救国民党反动统治垂危的命运。现在国民党反动派内部，好象一群海盗，在将要沉没的破船上，互相咒骂，互相厮打，穷凶极恶地抢夺他们认为可以救命的东西。豫东之战，蒋介石对他的主子和部下，伪造所谓“大捷”的消息，以图欺骗。蒋介石是向来讲什么“连坐法”的，这次豫东作战，蒋介石亲自指挥，丧师十万，开封不保，并使兖州襄阳失陷，直接负责者就是蒋介石自己，所以他只能讲“胜利”，只能把被全部干净彻底歼灭的七十五师，称为最有功劳的部队，不能讲“连坐法”了。蒋介石对其主子和部下，不能不采取这样的欺骗手段，这就表示，蒋介石的万恶统治，已经到了最后崩溃的边沿了。
    人民解放军以伟大的胜利，揭开了解放战争第三年的序幕。我们热烈庆祝这些胜利，并预祝今后更大的胜利。一切反共反人民的反动势力必定失败，人民的力量必定胜利。让美国帝国主义者和国民党反动派知道，中国将是中国人民的中国，将永远不允许任何侵略者与反动派在这块土地上藏垢纳污，为非作歹。
