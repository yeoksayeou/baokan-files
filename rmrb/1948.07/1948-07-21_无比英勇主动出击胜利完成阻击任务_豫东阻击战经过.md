Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, July 17th: The People's Liberation Army, with unparalleled heroism, tenacity, and proactive attacks, fiercely struck at the Chiang bandit Fifth Army and the 83rd Division, which attempted to reinforce the besieged Qu Shounian army group between ＠ (county) and Sui (county). They killed, wounded, and captured over 5,000 men from the Fifth Army and 3,000 men from the 83rd Division, totaling over 8,000 men, ensuring the glorious victory of annihilating the entire enemy Qu Shounian army group headquarters, the 75th Division, the entire New 21st Brigade, and part of the 25th Division. The course of the interception battle is as follows: When the enemy Qu Shounian army group was divided and surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, the enemy Fifth Army and 83rd Division hastily moved east from ＠ county to reinforce. From June 27th to July 6th, the enemy used aircraft, heavy artillery, and tanks to cover their eastward advance, but they were consistently blocked by the iron walls of the People's Liberation Army at predetermined positions such as Banzhuang, Xugang, Taolinggang, and Gaoyangji between ＠ county and Sui county. In those ten days, the enemy's furthest advance did not exceed ten *li*. On June 29th, the enemy Fifth Army's 96th Brigade and 139th Brigade launched a fierce attack on the positions around Gaoyangji and Sunzhai. The 415th Regiment of their 139th Brigade attempted to seize Chenzhuang, east of Gaoyangji, with superior forces. The 2nd Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, which was defending Chenzhuang, repelled six enemy attacks in eight hours, killing and wounding two companies of enemy troops. They held their position firmly and remained immovable, preventing the enemy from seizing a springboard for attacking Gaoyangji. From June 30th, the enemy Fifth Army again attempted to break through eastward in the Taolinggang area. Our army first killed and wounded over 200 enemies at Chengzhai, west of Taolinggang, and then launched counterattacks in villages such as Tu (west of Taolinggang). When the enemy approached our army's position with a battalion-sized force, combat hero Dai Xianyun led a platoon to leap out of the fortifications and attack the enemy fiercely. At the same time, the 5th Company inserted itself into the enemy's left rear flank in several directions, causing the enemy to fall like paper horses in the wind. The next day, the enemy used its elite 600th Regiment of the 200th Brigade, under the cover of aircraft, heavy artillery, and tanks, to attack our Taolinggang position. When the attacking enemy was still 300 meters away from our position, artilleryman A Sheng had already destroyed two enemy tanks in succession, and groups of enemies were killed. Then, they repelled the enemy's second attack and damaged two more of their tanks. At this point, our army took advantage of the victory to launch counterattacks on Zhangge, Quzhai, and other places near Taolinggang, capturing Quzhai and routing an enemy battalion headquarters and a company of the 599th Regiment, killing the enemy battalion commander Wu Fuen. On the third day, they tried their best to attack Taolinggang, using aircraft and heavy artillery for destructive bombardment. A battalion of the enemy's 600th Regiment was forced to launch a human-wave assault under the muzzles of supervising officers. We then launched a flanking counterattack, annihilating all of their second company. The enemy collapsed in disarray. In these three days alone, we killed and wounded over 2,000 enemy troops.

　　The enemy's 83rd Division, on the north bank of the Huiji River, attempted to seize our Xugang position, suffered heavy casualties, and was surrounded by us in Banzhuang and other places. Finally, they abandoned over 200 bodies and fled. Our army then pursued them, capturing over 20 alive. On the morning of July 3rd, the enemy Fifth Army replaced the enemy 83rd Division, throwing in all of its 45th Brigade and some attached tanks, and launched another fierce attack on Xugang, using twelve howitzers and more than ten aircraft to frantically bombard and strafe our positions. The commanders and fighters of a certain battalion of our army leaped out of the smoke-filled fortifications and engaged the enemy in fierce hand-to-hand combat, refusing to yield an inch of ground and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On the same day, the enemy Qu Shounian army group headquarters and the 75th Division were completely annihilated at Yuxiangpu, more than ten *li* east of Xugang. The enemy Fifth Army and 83rd Division, in addition to losing 8,000 men, gained nothing. A certain unit of our army successfully completed the interception mission.

　　无比英勇主动出击胜利完成阻击任务
  　豫东阻击战经过
    【新华社豫东前线十七日电】解放军在＠（县）睢（县）之间，以无比的英勇顽强与主动出击，痛击企图东援区寿年兵团的蒋匪第五军及八十三师，毙伤俘第五军五千余人，八十三师三千人共八千余人，保证了歼灭敌区寿年兵团部、七十五师及新二十一旅全部与二十五师一部的光辉胜利。阻击战经过如下：当敌区寿年兵团被解放军分割包围时，敌第五军及八十三师即仓惶自＠县东援。六月二十七日至七月六日，敌以飞机、重炮、战车掩护东犯，但始终被解放军的铜墙铁壁阻截于＠县、睢县间的班庄、许岗、桃林岗、高阳集等预定阵地之前，十天中敌人前进最远的不超过十里左右。六月二十九日，敌第五军九十六旅及一三九旅向高阳集、孙砦一带阵地猛扑，其一三九旅之四一五团妄图以优势兵力夺取高阳集以东之陈庄。坚守陈庄的解放军某部二连，在八小时内击退敌六次进攻，毙伤敌两个连的兵力。坚持阵地，屹然不动，使敌无法夺取进犯高阳集的跳板。六月三十日起，敌第五军又企图在桃林岗一带夺路东窜，我军首先在桃林岗以西之程砦杀伤敌二百余名，复于土（桃林岗西）等村展开反击。当敌人以一个营的兵力逼近我军阵地时，战斗英雄戴先运率一排跃出工事向敌人猛击，同时五连又突分数路插入敌左后侧，敌当如风吹纸马，纷纷倒地。次日，敌以其精锐的二百旅第六百团，在飞机、重炮与坦克掩护下，向我桃林岗阵地进犯。当进攻的敌人距我阵地尚有三百米时，炮手阿声已连续击毁敌两辆坦克，成群的敌人被击毙。接着又击溃敌第二次的进攻，并击伤其坦克两辆。至此我军乃乘胜对桃林岗附近之张阁、屈砦等地展开反击，并夺下屈砦，击溃敌五九九团一个营部及一个连，毙敌营长吴福恩。第三天又拼全力进犯桃林岗，并以飞机重炮作毁灭性轰击，敌六百团一营在督战枪口下，被迫作肉弹冲锋。我乃迂回反击，歼其二连全部，敌狼狈溃退，仅这三日之中我即毙伤敌二千余名。
    在惠济河北岸之敌八十三师企图夺我许岗阵地，遭受了重大杀伤后，被我包围于班庄等地，最后遗尸二百余具夺路逃窜。我军乃跟踪追击，生俘二十余名。七月三日上午，敌第五军接替敌八十三师，倾其四十五旅全部及配属战车一部，又向许岗猛犯，以十二门榴弹炮及十余架飞机向我疯狂轰击扫射。我军某营指战员自烟硝弥漫的工事里跃出与敌撕杀，寸土不让，予敌以重大杀伤。当日，敌区寿年兵团部及七十五师，即在许岗以东十余里的榆厢铺被全部歼灭。敌第五军及八十三师除损失八千人外，毫无所获。我某部胜利完成阻击任务。
