　　Break the Idea of Relying on Heaven for Food: Organize to Conquer Drought
  　　　　　Yuanzhao, Weixian County, Jinnan: Temporary Mutual Aid to Plant Late Seedlings
    [Jinnan News] The Weixian County Party Committee in Yuanzhao called on the masses to mobilize urgently to dig earth wells in large numbers, carry water to plant late seedlings, develop sideline production such as leaching salt and weaving, and practice strict economy to prevent famine. After various forms of publicity and mobilization, the masses in various villages gradually turned the call of the County Party Committee into action. Li Xinzhen, an activist from Li Maling Village in the Fifth District, introduced the specific experience of his group in planting sweet potatoes at the production team leaders' joint meeting, which increased the confidence of each group in planting. He said, "You can't be impatient when planting sweet potatoes in dry weather. Water them more, and they won't die from drought even in twenty days. If you want to plant quickly, you must mobilize both men and women, and assign specific tasks: men carry water, and women, children, and old men water, spread seedlings, and seal soil mounds. Our group rushed for seven days and planted twenty-one mu.” Under the practical influence of his group and the active leadership of village cadres and party members, the masses in the village planted a total of ninety-one mu of sweet potatoes in five days. Thirteen households in Dongtianzhuang in the Seventh District organized a temporary mutual aid group and carried water to plant eleven and a half mu. In order to save the fast-ripening pumpkins, party members and the masses in Huazhuang Village launched a pumpkin-watering competition. Some dug earth wells, and some carried water. In two days, they watered thirty-nine mu. The masses of Yangcun Temple put forward the slogan of "saving for famine" and "saving the bottom of the granary rather than the top." Eighty households completely switched from eating wheat to coarse grains.
    [Another News] Wang Gaozhai Village in the Second District of Weixian County failed to seize the opportunity to plant late seedlings and sweet potatoes after the last thorough rain. Many people had the idea of relying on heaven for food and were unwilling to carry water for planting; some middle peasants were afraid of being drawn on again if they had too much land and were unwilling to produce actively. Middle peasant Wang Jinshan didn't put manure on his land, and two people had already eaten more than a bag of newly harvested wheat. Xin Zhongnong Wang Jinshan had more land and felt uneasy because he was afraid of being drawn on. In view of this situation, the work team convened a mass meeting, clarifying that the land problem in the village had been resolved, and that individual households with less than the average amount could be filled in with temple land and land accumulated by the farmers' association. It called on everyone to plant late seedlings, accumulate fertilizer, and save with peace of mind. The masses felt relieved and began to discuss production. Some said, "If you plant sweet potatoes late, they will only grow hairy roots!" Others said, "It will be too late to plant after entering the dog days. You can't just wait for rain." Breaking the idea of relying on heaven for food, the entire village voluntarily formed nine temporary mutual aid groups. Strong young men carried water, and children and women watered and built mounds. In five days, they planted more than eighty mu of sweet potatoes. In order to plant more and harvest more, every household actively accumulated fertilizer. Middle peasant Wang Laoying plans to plant seven mu of wheat this year, and each mu needs three large carts of fertilizer. At present, he has mixed soil wheat, chaff, and green grass together and composted seven or eight large carts of fertilizer. Wang Laofeng applied a lot of fertilizer last year, and the wheat harvest was good. Now he has dug a large manure pit and is preparing to compost six or seven more carts than last year. The masses said, "Prevent drought every year, and prevent thieves every night. You can't just eat wheat!" At present, many households have begun to eat coarse grains instead of just wheat.
    　　　　Yangcheng and Other Counties Carry Water to Plant
    [Taiyue News] Yangcheng, Jincheng, Gaoping, and Qinshui counties have not had rain for a long time, and most of the stubble land has not been planted yet. The leaders of the counties have respectively called on the masses to carry water for planting, speed up weeding, and overcome the disaster. In most areas of the four counties, people have begun to carry water for planting. Dianyao in Yangcheng is a small village that accepted the experience of "preventing drought every year." It dug thirty thatched ponds on the edge of the fields and roads early on, which can store rainwater and compost fertilizer, and this time they were used for planting. During planting, forces were closely organized, and both men and women were assigned specific tasks. Some plowed the land, some dug pits, and some scooped fertilizer for planting. Everyone was busy. People had been at the village well for seven or eight consecutive days. The entire village planted more than seven hundred mu in ten days and weeded the millet twice. Hotels, Yiyi, Liuchang, Yuezhuang, Nandie, Yinjiagou and other villages carried more than 40,000 dan of water, plus composted fertilizer, and planted more than 2,000 mu. In Jincheng's Seventh District, carrying water and fertilizer for planting late autumn crops has resulted in over 3,000 mu of planted corn, according to incomplete statistics. Lilichuan Village had the best labor organization, with more than 800 people working in the fields. They planted 200 mu in seven days. Zhongcun and other twenty villages in Qinshui also organized all their forces and invested in carrying water for planting. However, individual villages in the above four counties are still waiting and praying for rain, and are not actively fighting the drought. On June 28th, cadres and masses in Dingyan Village, Yangcheng, set up an altar to chant scriptures and pray for rain for seven days, wasting 171,000 yuan (Jibi currency), 29 jin of white flour, and 12 jin of lamp oil.
    　　　　Breakthrough Key Points to Promote Overall Progress: Suning's Sixth District Actively Digs Wells
    [Jizhong News] Suning's Sixth District used the method of breaking through key points to promote overall progress, changing the masses' habit of being unwilling to dig wells. At the beginning of this year, the Hebei-Central Water Conservancy Work Team arrived in Suning's Sixth District and determined that Dawangzhuang was the key village for well digging. At the beginning of the work, the masses were read newspapers and enlightened, saying, "Land reform is for developing production and living a good life. How can we live a good life?" At that time, Zhang Guangyi said, "To live a good life, we must dig wells." (In 1942, when there was a drought, Zhang Guangyi harvested three bags of corn per mu because he dug a well and watered the land. Others who did not have wells to water the land only harvested one or two dou. Therefore, he had great confidence in digging wells.) The leadership found several activists through him, and each person then colluded with six or seven households, and convened a meeting to discuss how to dig wells. Each household reported how much private money they could contribute, and the insufficient part was helped with loans. Through the leading influence of these backbone members and the continuous publicity of the benefits of digging wells, the masses' concerns about digging wells were gradually broken, and a well-digging movement was launched. Six wells have now been dug, two have been repaired, and five new wells and two old wells are starting to be built. After Dawangzhuang created a fever, the relatives and friends of the well-digging households in the village were used to publicize the benefits of digging wells in many ways. Sun Yanchi from Licun came to the well-digging team and asked for a loan to dig a well, and the work team seized him to organize and promote well-digging in Licun. Later, Licun and Wobei were organized to dig wells together. On this basis, the leadership called on the entire district to carry out the well-digging movement. However, deviations occurred in the mastery, such as squeezing the masses to take private money, and failing to issue the loans that should have been issued in a timely manner, so some farmers who wanted to dig wells were still unwilling to do so. After the review and correction, the enthusiasm of the masses increased again. Dawangzhuang established a "Water Conservancy Section" under the village production committee to specifically lead well digging. Dawangzhuang and Songzhuang lent the bricks from the fruits of the village struggle to the masses at a combined price. Through these efforts, Dawangzhuang formed eight new large wells and three old large wells in one day, and some started construction the next day. The village plans to dig 20 wells. As of the end of June, 14 new wells had been dug and 7 old wells had been repaired in 15 villages in the district; 41 new and old wells were under construction or about to begin construction. The capital used included 34.25 million yuan (border currency), 3,800 yuan of floating property, 79.9 million yuan in loans, and 450 jin of loaned grain.

　　打破靠天吃饭思想组织起来战胜旱灾
  　　　　　冀南元朝威县　临时互助点种晚苗
    【冀南讯】元朝县委号召群众紧急动员起来，大量挖土井、挑水点种晚苗；开展淋盐、编织等副业生产；并厉行节约防备灾荒。各村群众经过各种形式的宣传动员，逐步把县委号召变成行动。五区李马陵村积极分子李新贞在生产组长联席会上，介绍了本组栽红薯的具体经验，提高了各组点种的信心。他说：“旱天种红薯不能心急，多浇点水，二十天也旱不死。要想种的快，必须把男女都动员起来，具体分工，男子挑水，妇女儿童老头浇水、散秧、封土堆。俺组这样突击了七天，种上二十一亩。”该村群众在他这个组的实际影响和村干、党员的积极领导下，五天内共栽红薯九十一亩。七区东田庄十三户组织了临时互助组，挑水栽了十一亩半。化庄党员群众为了把快熟的南瓜救住，全村掀起了浇瓜竞赛，有的挖土井，有的挑水，两天内浇了三十九亩。杨村寺群众提出“节约备荒”“能省囤尖不省囤底”的口号，有八十户由光吃麦子完全换上粗粮。
    【又讯】威县二区王高砦村，在上次落透雨后，没抓紧抢种晚苗和红薯，不少群众存在靠天吃饭思想，不愿担水点种；有些中农怕地多了再抽，不愿积极生产。中农王金善有粪不往地里拉，新收的麦子两口人已经吃了一布袋多。新中农王金山土地多一点，怕抽他的，心里不安。根据这种情况，工作组便召开群众大会，讲明这村土地问题已经解决，个别户不足平均数，可由庙地和农会积存的土地填平。号召大家安心点种晚苗，积肥，节约。群众安下心来酝酿生产，有的说：“种红薯种晚了光长毛根！”有的说：“等入了伏再种就晚了，光等雨可不行。”打破了靠天吃饭的思想，全村自愿结合了九个临时互助组，青壮年担水，儿童妇女点水、培墩，五天内种红薯八十余亩。群众为了多种多收，家家积极积肥，中农王老营今年计划种麦七亩，每亩要上粪三大车。现时他把土麦、糠和青草拌在一起，已沤成了七八大车粪。王老凤去年上粪多，麦子收的好。现在他又挖了一个大粪坑，准备比去年再多沤粪六、七车。群众说：“年年防旱，夜夜防贼，不能光吃麦子！”现时已有不少户从光吃麦子开始吃粗粮。
    　　　　阳城等县担水点种
    【太岳讯】阳城、晋城、高平、沁水四县久未落雨，大部茬地还没种上。各县领导上分别号召群众担水点种，加紧锄苗，战胜灾荒。四县大部地区，纷纷开始担水点种。阳城殿腰是个小村，接受过去“年年防旱”的经验，早在地边路边挖了三十个茅池，既可存储雨水，又可沤粪，这次点种就用上了。点种时严密的组织了力量，男女全半劳力具体分工，有的犁地，有的挖坑，有的舀粪点种，人人不闲。村里水井上一连七、八天没断过人。全村十天点种了七百多亩，又把谷子赶锄了二遍。酒店、阳邑、留昌、岳庄、南底、尹家沟等村担水四万多担，加上沤粪，共点种了二千多亩。晋城七区担水担粪点种晚秋，据不完全统计，已点种玉茭三千亩。犁川村组织劳力最好，全村有八百多人上地，七天就点种了二百亩。沁水中村等二十村也组织了全部力量，投入担水点。但以上四县仍有个别村庄还在等雨求雨，没有积极的与旱灾作斗争。阳城町岩村干部和群众在六月二十八日设坛念经，求神求雨，闹了七天，浪费了十七万一千元（冀钞），白面二十九斤，灯油十二斤。
    　　　　突破重点推动全面　肃宁六区积极打井
    【冀中讯】肃宁六区运用突破重点、推动全面的方法，转变了群众不愿打井的习惯。今年一开春，冀中水利工作组到了肃宁六区，确定以大王庄为打井重点村。工作开始首先给群众念报，启发群众说：“土改是为了发展生产，过好日子，怎么才能过好日子呢？”当时张广义说：“要过好日子就得打井。”（民国三十一年天旱时，因张广义打了井浇了地，每亩棒子收了三口袋，别人没井浇地，只收了一、二斗。因此，他对打井信心很大。）领导上便通过他找了几个积极分子，每人再串通六、七户，召开会议，讨论如何打井的办法。每户都自报了能出多少私资，不足部分就用贷款帮助。经过这些骨干分子的带头影响，和不断宣传打井的好处，逐渐打破了群众对打井的顾虑，掀起了打井运动，现在已打成六眼，修成了两眼，还有五个新井两个旧井正在开始动工。大王庄造成热潮后又通过，该村打井户的亲戚朋友，多方宣传打井的好处。李村孙砚池便来找打井组，要求贷款打井，工作组就抓紧他在李村组织推动。后来又组织李村、窝北合伙打井。在这个基础上，领导上便号召全区开展打井运动。但在掌握上发生了挤着群众拿私资，该发的贷款没有及时发下去等偏向，有些要求打井的农民仍不愿打了。检讨纠正后，群众情绪再次提高。大王庄在村生产委员会下面设了“水利股”，专门领导打井。大王庄、宋庄把村里斗争果实中的砖合成价贷给群众。经这些努力，大王庄一天就组成了八眼新大井，三眼旧大井，有的第二天就动起工来。该村计划可打井二十眼。截至六月底，该区十五个村已打成新井十四眼，修理旧井七眼；正在动工和即将动工的有新旧井四十一眼。动用的资本包括私资三千四百二十五万元（边币，下同），浮财三千八百元，贷款七千九百九十万元和贷粮四百五十斤。
