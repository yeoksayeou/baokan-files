　　Not Waiting for Rain, Not Relying on Heaven
    Nanfeng, Yuanchao and Other Counties are Planting and Watering Seedlings
    [Ji-Lu-Yu News] The masses in Kongzhuang and other villages in the Second District of Nanfeng are breaking with the idea of waiting for rain, with men and women, young and old, all pitching in to water and plant seedlings. Most of the old women, women, and children are also going to the fields to carry water to plant sweet potatoes. The village head, Zhang Fanjiang's, mother is eighty-three years old but is still vying to go to the fields, not willing to be idle for a moment. In four days, the whole village carried water to plant thirty-seven and a half mu of sweet potatoes. Based on the Administrative Office's urgent call for planting and fighting drought, the comrades stationed in the village convened a mass meeting on the evening of the 7th of this month, mobilizing everyone to carry water to plant corn. After everyone discussed it, Zeng Zhong said: "My sweet potatoes are all planted, I will plant corn first thing tomorrow. If it doesn't rain, we still have to eat, relying on heaven is not as good as relying on ourselves." After a long discussion, most people agreed to speed up planting and started to take action the next day. The Liuzhuang work team convened a meeting of party members of the branch in groups on the 8th of this month to discuss ways to fight drought, water, and plant. They discussed several specific suggestions: (1) Plant more sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes are drought-resistant and have a high yield. One load of water can water ten sweet potato plants, and they don't need to be watered again for half a month. (2) Sow radishes, which have a high yield and ensure a harvest. (3) Plant corn. Rake the land, dig a pit, pour some water in it, and plant it. When the seedlings come out, dig a ditch and water it again, and it won't matter if it doesn't rain for twenty days. Everyone agreed with these methods and said: Go back and mobilize the neighbors to water and plant, start immediately, and we can't rely on heaven for food.
    [Ji'nan News] The masses in many villages in Yuanchao, Qiu County, and Linzhang are fighting drought and preventing disasters by carrying water to plant seedlings. At a meeting of village cadres in the Shalu sub-district of the Fourth District of Yuanchao, the methods of fighting drought and preparing for famine were specifically discussed. Qian Shalu Village is preparing to mobilize the masses to dig a large number of earth wells; Cao Kun Village is preparing to repair the broken wells and use the pit water to water melons, seedlings, and plant sweet potatoes. After the meeting, Bei Wangfeng Village immediately took action, carrying water to plant eighteen and a half mu of corn in two days. Wang Guo'an, the production director of Menggu in the Third District of Qiu County, said at the production committee meeting: "Dog days are coming soon, and now is the time to plant sweet potatoes. It may be too late to wait for the rain." At the meeting of production team leaders, he called on the masses to carry water to plant, and the whole village has already started. The men in Wang Yuewang's family carry water, three children water the ground, and two women plant seedlings, planting two mu in one morning. The whole village carried two thousand two hundred loads of water in three days, planting a total of forty-six mu of sweet potatoes. Wang Yuecong, the village head of Gutian Village in Linzhang, immediately held a meeting of cadres above the team leader level after returning to the village from the sub-district meeting to study the "organizational leadership for drought resistance and famine preparedness." Under the leadership of all village cadres and team leaders, nine waterwheels were erected and repaired within five or six days, which can water twenty-seven mu of land every day. Many women also participated in weeding. Li Xiaogen's mother is over forty years old and hoes more than one mu of land a day; Zhao Xiaoqing also led his wife to hoe the ground. The whole village has now weeded three times, and the wheat stubble has also been hoeed twice.

　　不等雨不靠天
    南峰元朝等县点种浇苗
    【冀鲁豫讯】南峰二区孔庄等村群众打破等雨思想，男女老幼下手灌水栽苗。多数老婆婆、妇女、小孩也都下地担水抬水栽种红薯。村长张繁江的母亲八十三岁了，还争着上地，一会不肯闲着。四天工夫，全村担水栽红薯三十七亩半。驻村工作同志根据行署点种抗旱的紧急号召，又于本月七日晚间，召开群众大会，动员大家担水种棒子，大家酝酿起来，曾仲说：“我的红薯栽完啦，明天一早就点种玉蜀黍去，天不下雨也不能不吃饭，靠天吃饭不如靠自己。”讨论了很长时间，多数人都同意加紧点种，第二天就行动起来。刘庄工作组于本月八日召集支部党员分组开会，商量抗旱浇地点种办法，讨论出几个具体意见：（一）多栽红薯。红薯耐旱，收成又多。种红薯一挑水能浇十棵，可以半月不再浇。（二）撒萝卜，收的多，还保险收。（三）点棒子。耙好地，挖个坑，浇点水点下去，出了苗再挖个沟浇一下，二十天不下雨也不碍事。大家同意这些办法，都说：回去动员邻居都浇地栽种，马上干，不能靠天吃饭。
    【冀南讯】元朝、邱县、临漳不少村庄群众抗旱防灾，担水点苗。元朝四区沙路小区村干联席会上，专门讨论抗旱备荒办法。前沙路村准备发动群众大量挖土井；曹坤村准备把坏井修理好，并利用坑水浇瓜、浇苗、点种红薯。北王奉村会后立即行动，两天内担水点种玉茭十八亩半。邱县三区孟固生产主任王国安，在召开生产委员会时说：“伏天快到，现在正是栽红薯的时候，等着天下雨再栽恐怕晚了。”在开生产小组长会时，又号召群众担水栽种，现全村已经开始。王月望家男的担水，三个小孩浇地，两个妇女插种，一晌栽了二亩。全村在三天内担了二千二百担水，共栽红薯四十六亩。临漳谷天村村长王月从，在小区开会回村后，立即开组长以上干部会，研究“抗早备荒的组织领导。”在全村干部组长领导下，五六天内按起和修理好水车九辆，每天能浇田二十七亩。锄苗中很多妇女也参加了，李小根娘四十多岁，一天锄地一亩多；赵小庆也领着他媳妇去锄地。现全村锄苗已过三遍，麦茬也锄了两遍。
