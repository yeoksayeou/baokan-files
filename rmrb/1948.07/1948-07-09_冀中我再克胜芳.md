　　[Jizhong 5th dispatch] The Jizhong People's Liberation Army once again captured Shengfang City, an important commercial town west of Tianjin, on the 1st. Most of the defending enemies were wiped out. A remnant of the enemy fled to areas north of Xinzhang, CeCheng (more than ten miles northeast of Shengfang) and Taitou (about ten miles east of Shengfang), where they were met head-on by our ambushing troops. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 509 enemy soldiers were annihilated, including one battalion of the puppet defense second regiment, parts of the puppet Wen'an police force, and the third brigade of Zhu ZhanKui's bandit troops (including 469 captured alive); one heavy machine gun, fourteen light machine guns, two small cannons, 232 rifles and pistols, 12,127 rounds of ammunition of various types, 35 artillery shells, and a portion of other military supplies were seized. In addition, three days before the capture of Shengfang (June 28th), a unit of our army seized three American-style trucks and captured 18 puppet bandits in Xinzhang. Shengfang City was recovered by us on May 31st and we voluntarily withdrew on June 7th. After more than 20 days, it has now returned to our hands.
