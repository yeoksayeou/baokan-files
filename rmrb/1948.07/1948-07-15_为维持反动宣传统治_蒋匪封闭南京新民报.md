　　To Maintain Reactionary Propaganda Rule
    Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Close Down Nanjing Xinmin Daily

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th] Nanjing News: The Chiang Kai-shek government issued an order on the 8th to close down the Nanjing edition of Xinmin Daily. The Ministry of Interior of the Chiang government announced that the newspaper was ordered to be "permanently suspended" on the grounds of "spreading rumors, inciting people, and demoralizing morale." The facts it cited were due to the newspaper's past fragmentary disclosure in news reports of some truths about Chiang Kai-shek's military defeats and the brutal massacre of peaceful people. For example, the article "Looking at the Northwest War Situation" published on April 14 reported that Chiang's army was short of troops and "controlled by others." The June 26 issue carried a conversation with students in Kaifeng, saying that "large and small buildings in the commercial district of Kaifeng were bombed by the air force, and 60,000 to 70,000 people were killed or injured." The newspaper has five editions in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Chongqing, and Chengdu. Its general manager is Chen Mingde, a member of the Kuomintang, and the manager of its Nanjing edition is Chen Mingde's wife and a legislator of the puppet government, Deng Jixing. It is widely believed that the Chiang government's closure of Xinmin Daily at this time, in addition to generally maintaining its rule of rumors and reactionary propaganda, is related to its exaggerating the fabricated Yudong victory and prohibiting the disclosure of the truth about the Yudong fiasco. However, an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 8th stated: This move instead "made Nanjing's journalists less calm about the war situation than before."

　　为维持反动宣传统治
    蒋匪封闭南京新民报
    【新华社陕北十三日电】南京消息：蒋介石政府于八日下令封闭新民报南京版。蒋政府内政部宣布勒令该报“永久停刊”的罪名是“散布谣言，煽惑人心，沮丧士气”。而其所列举的事实，则系因该报过去曾在新闻报导中片断地泄露过蒋介石军事惨败与残暴屠杀和平人民的若干真相，如该报四月十四日刊载“看西北战局”一文，曾报导蒋军兵力空虚，“受制于人”，六月二十六日刊载开封学生谈话，谓“开封商业区大小建筑都被空军炸平，被炸死伤者六、七万人”等等。该报共有南京、上海、北平、重庆及成都五个版，其总经理为国民党党员陈铭德，其南京版经理为陈铭德之妻且系伪政府之立法委员邓季惺。众信蒋政府这个时候来封闭新民报，除为了一般地维持其谣言与反动宣传的统治外，与它大吹其捏造的豫东大捷，禁止泄漏其豫东惨败的真相有关。但美联社南京八日电称：此举反而“使得南京的报人对战局没有以前那样镇静”。
