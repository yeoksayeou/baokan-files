　　Introduction to Xiangfan
    Xiangyang is located on the south bank of the middle reaches of the Han River, facing Fancheng across the river. Therefore, it is commonly called Xiangfan. The two places are located at the passage of Tongbai Mountain and Wudang Mountain, controlling the middle reaches of the Han River. It connects Guan (Zhong) and Luo (Yang) in the north, Sha (Shi) and Yi (Chang) in the south, the three towns of Wuhan in the east, and controls the Sichuan-Shaanxi Avenue in the west. It has always been a key military location and a major commercial town in northern Hubei. Products from Shaanxi, Gansu, and western Henan are exported from here. The total population of Xiangfan is about 80,000.
