　　【Taiyue Telegram】The Yangcheng Women's Federation meeting held from July 5th to 10th identified the following problems in the past organization of women's mutual aid in various villages: (1) Lack of leading cadres. Some villages organized women's mutual aid groups, but because no one led them, the organizations collapsed after being formed. (2) Failure to combine women's demands with family demands. Some women are still restricted in their labor. Parents and husbands do not sympathize with their daughters-in-law going to the fields to work. If they participate in mutual aid, they are bullied by their families. The money earned by women from production is all handed over to the family. They can't even afford to buy a handkerchief, and they are not motivated to work. (3) The phenomenon of non-voluntary and unequal exchange also exists in women's mutual aid. The mutual aid group has become a muddled group, which greatly affects women's participation in mutual aid. In response to the above shortcomings, the Women's Federation determined: (1) Women's mutual aid must implement the three major principles of voluntary combination, equivalent exchange, and democratic leadership. (2) Women's earned wages can be distributed between the women and the family according to the actual situation. Some places have adopted an 20/80 split (family gets 80%, women get 20%), which greatly encourages women's labor. (3) Systematically cultivate key personnel and establish a leadership core. (4) In terms of organizational form, don't demand too much at once. It should develop gradually from small to large. In weaving, pay attention to improving women's skills and the quality of cloth, so that it can not only be self-sufficient, but also be sold.

　　阳城检查妇女生产
    【太岳电】在七月五日到十日召开的阳城妇联会上，检查出过去各村组织妇女互助中存在以下几个问题：（一）缺乏领导骨干，有些村组织起妇女互助组，因没人领导，组织起来就垮了。（二）没有把妇女的要求和家庭的要求结合起来。有些妇女在劳动上还受束缚。父母和丈夫不同情自己的媳妇下地劳动，她们参加了互助，就受家里人的气。妇女们生产赚下的钱全交了家里，自己想买块手巾也没个钱，动弹的不起劲。（三）妇女互助中不自愿不等价的现象同样存在，互助组成了糊涂组，大大影响了妇女参加互助。妇联会针对以上缺点，确定：（一）妇女互助必须贯彻自愿结合、等价交换、民主领导的三大原则。（二）妇女赚的工资，可以根据实际情况，实行与家庭分红制度。有些地方已采用了二八分红（家庭八分、妇女二分），颇能鼓励妇女劳动。（三）有计划培养骨干，建立领导核心。（四）组织形式上不要一下要求过高，应由小而大，逐渐发展。在纺织上注意提高妇女技术，提高布的质量，要做到不但能自给，而且能够出卖。
