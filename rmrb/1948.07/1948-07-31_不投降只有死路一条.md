　　No Surrender Only Leads to Death
　　Yang Ming
　　After the victory in the Dachangzhen annihilation battle, the People's Liberation Army found a handwritten order on the battlefield from Duan @, commander of the 217th Regiment of the 73rd Division, to his battalion commander Wang Linxiang, ordering Wang Linxiang to "defend the position to the death, even if only one soldier is left, or face court-martial." This order was found on Wang Linxiang's corpse. On the battlefield, the People's Liberation Army saw enemy soldiers' corpses with ropes tied to their backs. These soldiers were probably unable to withstand the PLA's artillery fire and were "court-martialed" by Yan's "iron-blooded core troops." But what use was that? Soldiers (and even many field-grade officers) still surrendered to the People's Liberation Army in large numbers. Wang Linxiang himself died, arms outstretched, in the rubble of Dachangzhen. This proves that if you don't surrender, you only face death. Wang Linxiang could only guarantee that he himself faithfully executed Duan's order. The soldiers were not willing to walk the path to death. Moreover, when they were liberated, they would turn their guns and fire at those who had oppressed them. A soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army personally witnessed a Yan army soldier, after being liberated by us in Xifan Village, immediately ask us for a rifle and shoot down more than a dozen of his commanders who were still resisting. This soldier said that these guys had beheaded many soldiers, and they deserved revenge even in death. Originally, after Xifan Village was surrounded by us, soldiers complained about not having enough to eat, and they were labeled as "fake elements" by the officers and "beheaded and displayed to the public."
　　Yan Xishan's most severe bloody rule cannot save him from death. All of Yan Xishan's loyal followers should wake up. [Jinzhong Frontline Communication]

　　不投降只有死路一条
    杨明
    大常镇歼灭战结束后，解放军在战场上，拣到七十三师二一七团团长段＠给他的营长王麟翔的亲笔命令，叫王麟翔“虽剩一兵一卒，也要死守阵地，违者军法从事”，这个命令，是从王麟翔的尸身上搜出来的，解放军在战场上，看到敌人一些士兵的死尸背上，还捆着绳子，这些士兵，大概就是因为受不了解放军的炮火，被阎匪的“铁军基干”“军法从事”了的，这有什么用处呢？士兵们（甚至许多校级军官们）还是大批大批的当了解放军的俘虏，王麟翔本人也伸开两臂，死在大常镇的乱瓦堆里。这证明，若不投降，只有死路一条，王麟翔只能保证他自己忠实执行段＠的命令，士兵们是不会往死路上走的，而且，当他们被解放以后，他们就会调转枪口，对准曾经压迫过他们的人开枪，解放军某部战士，曾亲眼看到一个阎匪士兵，在西范村被我解放后，马上向我们要一支步枪，把他的还在顽抗的指挥官打倒十余个，这个士兵说，这些家伙，砍过很多当兵的，死也要报报仇。原来，西范村被我包围后，士兵吃不饱饭讲怪话，就被当官的按上个“伪装分子”的罪名，“枭首示众”了。
    阎匪锡山再严重的血腥统治，也挽救不了他的死亡，一切阎锡山的忠实信徒，应该清醒了。【晋中前线通讯】
