[Chahar News] Through the vigorous leadership and education of county and district cadres, the masses in the Fourth District of Laishui have broken with certain conservative habits in agricultural production and have gradually improved their techniques. The district has thirty villages, with a total of 18,538 mu of land. In the past, due to a lack of attention to improving agricultural techniques, the production volume was very low. Generally, dry land only yielded six or seven dou per mu annually (each dou being eighteen jin). The farming methods of the local farmers had the following shortcomings: (1) They were not accustomed to autumn plowing, fearing that the soil would be blown away by the wind if the land was plowed in the autumn, and they also disliked that autumn plowing would mean they had to plow again in the spring, which they found troublesome and laborious. (2) They were unwilling to plow and sow early in the spring, often sowing without plowing, or plowing and sowing at the same time. (3) Except for planting millet on flat land, corn, beans, and other crops were mostly sown randomly, scattering the seeds on the ground, plowing it once, and considering it finished. (4) They had no habit of accumulating fertilizer. Households did not have toilets, did not cut artemisia, or press green manure. Pigs were not kept in pens, and cow and sheep pens were not lined with soil, so the land could not be fertilized much. (5) Stubble was left in the fields after the autumn harvest. Last winter and this spring, through vigorous education and leadership, some old habits have been initially improved. Half of the villages in the district implemented autumn plowing, accounting for about 20 percent of the total land. This spring, during plowing and sowing, the leadership again emphasized early plowing, drilling, or dibbling, calling for no planting on stubble land and no random sowing. Around the Qingming Festival, they promptly organized livestock teams and manpower to pull plows, mobilizing men, women, and children to complete plowing and sowing in half a month. According to incomplete statistics for the district, 2,930 mu of corn were drilled and 5,805 mu were dibbled, accounting for about 40 percent of the total land. Currently, the first weeding has been completed in the entire district, and the second weeding in most villages is one-sixth complete. According to the masses, drilling and dibbling are easier to weed and save labor, but some new shortcomings have also emerged, namely, the seedlings from drilling are too dense, and some people who dibble do not know how to thin the seedlings. There has also been considerable progress in accumulating fertilizer. According to incomplete statistics, 931 toilets have been dug in the entire district. Currently, during the artemisia cutting season, a vigorous green manure pressing campaign has been launched to lay the foundation for fertilization next year. In the autumn harvest, they also plan to vigorously lead autumn plowing to transform the conservative farming habits of the local masses.

　　涞水四区群众逐渐打破旧习
  　农业技术初步提高
    【察哈尔讯】经县区干部大力领导教育，涞水四区群众打破农业生产上某些保守习惯，逐步提高了技术。该区三十个村，共有地一万八千五百三十八亩，过去因不注意改进农业技术，致生产量很低，一般旱地每亩常年产量仅六、七斗（每斗十八斤）。当地农民的耕作方法有以下几个缺点：（一）不习惯秋耕地，怕秋天耕了地被风刮去了土，并嫌秋耕了春天还要耕，麻烦费事。（二）春天不愿早耕早种，常常不耕就种，或现种现耕。（三）除平地谷耩种外，棒子豆类大都是乱撒种，把籽乱撒到地里，一耕就算完事。（四）没有积肥习惯，住户没有厕所，不打蒿不压绿肥，养猪没有圈，牛羊圈里不垫土，地里不能多上粪。（五）秋收时地里留禾楂。去冬与今春，经过领导上大力教育与领导，当地某些旧习惯已有初步改进。全区有半数村庄实行了秋耕，约占总土地的百分之二十。今年春耕播种时，领导上又有重点的提倡早耕、耩种或点种，号召不种楂地、不乱撒田。在清明前后，就抓紧组织牲口犋及人拉犁，动员男女老少，在半月中完成耕种。据全区不完全的统计，玉米耩种二千九百三十亩、点种五千八百零五亩，约占总土地百分之四十。现全区已锄完头遍，大部村庄的二遍已锄完了六分之一。据群众反映，点种和耩种的又好锄又省工，但又产生了些新缺点，即耩种的苗儿留的密，还有点种的不知间苗。积肥也有相当成绩，据不完全统计，全区已挖厕所九百三十一个。目前正在打蒿期间，大力开展了压绿肥运动，打下明年施肥的基础。到秋收时还准备大力领导秋耕，改造当地群众保守的农作习惯。
