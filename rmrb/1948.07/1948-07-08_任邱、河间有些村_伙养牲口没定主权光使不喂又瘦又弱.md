[Hebei Central News] In Renqiu First District, 48 head of livestock have died since the Lunar New Year, greatly affecting production. According to investigations, there are two reasons for the deaths: one is that the livestock was the result of struggle and was not properly distributed or managed. Watering and feeding were irregular, resulting in some starving to death. The other is that the livestock was distributed to teams for raising, but there were no definite systems or methods. Some people only used the livestock but didn't feed them well, resulting in illness and death. Some died from carelessness while using the livestock, causing injuries or strokes. In some villages in Hejian, confiscated and requisitioned livestock are also becoming thin and weak due to lack of proper distribution and management, and some have died. In Feng Village, Third District, livestock obtained through struggle are raised together, but are not well cared for. The livestock are very thin from hunger, and one has already died. In Xishawa, Fifth District, one animal is so hungry that it has collapsed and cannot get up.

　　任邱、河间有些村
    伙养牲口没定主权光使不喂又瘦又弱
    【冀中讯】任邱一区从旧历年到现在，死了牲口四十八头，影响生产很大。死亡的原因，根据检查有两个：一种是斗争果牲口，因没有很好分配，又未很好管理，饮水喂草都没准，结果有的饿死了。另一种是斗争果实牲口，分到小组里养着，没有一定的制度和办法，有些人光使不好好喂，生病而死。有些是使牲口时不小心，牲口身上磨碰受伤，中风病死的。河间有些村庄没收与征收的牲口，也因为没有很好分配和管理，饿的又瘦又弱，有的死了。三区冯村把斗出的牲口在一块养着，没很好保管，牲口饿的很瘦，已死了一个。五区西沙洼，一个牲口饿的倒下起不来。
