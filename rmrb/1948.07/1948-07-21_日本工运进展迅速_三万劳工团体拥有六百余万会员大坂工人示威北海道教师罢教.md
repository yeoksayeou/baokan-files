Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. TASS, 12th, quoting Tokyo newspapers: The labor movement in Japan is rapidly advancing. The "National Federation of Industrial Labor Unions" has decided to lead a joint struggle with the civil servant unions and municipal worker unions, proving that there is a tendency in Japan to establish a united front of working people. The coal miners' union, which recently protested the coal mine accident, has warned that unless labor safety facilities are improved, countermeasures will be taken. The Federation of Silk Workers' Unions, with 80,000 members, has requested the "Central Labor Problem Committee" to mediate on the issue of wage increase demands. Railway workers in Aomori Prefecture are now preparing for a strike. The "Tokyo Minpo" predicts that the upcoming "workers' offensive will be a broad, powerful, and lasting one." The Jiji Shinpo was also forced to admit that trade unions are now much stronger than they were in March. According to Kyodo News: Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida recently threatened that the government will take "forceful measures" to deal with the trade union offensive. Note: At the time of Japan's surrender, there were only 450,000 trade union members in Japan, which increased to more than 2 million at the beginning of 1946, and suddenly increased to 4.45 million at the end of the same year. In May 1947, there were 19,000 trade unions in Japan, uniting 5.5 million workers, half of whom were members of the left-wing trade union organization - the National Federation of Industrial Labor Unions. According to a survey by MacArthur Headquarters on June 28: At present, the number of Japanese labor groups, including local unions, has reached 30,000, with a total of 6.5 million members.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. Tokyo News: Two thousand members of the "National Federation of Industrial Labor Unions" and Korean youths marched and demonstrated in Osaka on the 13th, protesting against the police's oppression of the people, and held a mass rally, demanding the immediate dissolution of the parliament. Teachers and staff in various schools in Hokkaido went on a 24-hour strike on the 13th, demanding a salary increase. Japanese newspaper reports pointed out that this was the prelude to the "All-Japan Teachers' Union's" nationwide 24-hour strike on July 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. TASS Tokyo News: Since the 11th, the Ashida government has increased the prices of the people's main foods, such as rice, wheat, barley, potatoes, and soybeans, by an average of 50% to 100%. According to the "Japan Economy": The Japanese working class is deeply angered by the rise in the prices of necessities. Kokumi Kikitani, chairman of the "National Federation of Industrial Labor Unions" of Japan, criticized the government for formulating a plan to revise prices with some businessmen before an agreement was reached on the budget issue, and for raising prices without submitting the issue to the parliament.

　　日本工运进展迅速
  　三万劳工团体拥有六百余万会员大坂工人示威北海道教师罢教
    【新华社陕北十九日电】据塔斯社十二日电引东京报纸消息称：日本的劳工运动正急速前进中。“全国产业劳动组合联合会”决定领导与公务员工会及市政人员工会共同进行的联合斗争，证明在日本已存在建立劳动人民统一战线的趋势。最近曾抗议煤矿出事的矿工工会已发出警告称：除非劳工安全设施得到改善，否则即将采取对策。拥有会员八万的丝业工人工会联合会，要求“中央劳工问题委员会”进行调解关于增资要求的问题。青森县的铁道工人，现正准备罢工。“东京民报”预言：即将到来的“工人攻势，将是一个广泛的、有力的及持久的攻势。”时事新报也被迫承认，职工会现均较三月份时强大得多。据协同社讯：日首相芦田均最近扬言，政府将采取“有力措施”以对付职工会的攻势。按：在日本投降时，全日职工会会员只有四十五万人，至一九四六年初增至二百余万人，同年年底突增至四百四十五万人。一九四七年五月，日本已有一万九千个职工会，团结了五百五十万工人，其中半数是左翼职工组织——全国产业劳动组合联合会的会员。又据麦克阿瑟总部于六月二十八日统计：在目前包括地方工会在内之日本劳工团体数达三万，共拥有六百五十万名会员。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】东京消息：“全国产业劳动组合联合会”属下之两千会员及朝鲜青年，于十三日在大坂游行示威，抗议警察对人民之压迫，并举行群众大会，提出立即解散议会的要求。北海道各校的教职员，曾于十三日进行二十四小时罢教，要求增薪。日本报纸消息指出：这是“全日教师联盟”七月十五日举行全国性二十四小时罢教之序幕。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社东京讯：自十一日起，芦田政府已将人民主要食物如大米、小麦、大麦、洋芋及大豆等之价格，平均提高百分之五十至一百。据“日本经济”称：日本工人阶级对必需品价格之上涨深表愤怒。日本“全国产业劳动组合联合会”主席听涛克已抨击政府在预算问题达成协议以前，即与若干商人制定改订物价的计划，并且未将此问题提交议会即行提高物价。
