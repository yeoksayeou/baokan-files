Xinhua News Agency, Jinsui, 3rd. The directly subordinate organs and troops of the Jinsui Military Region began to study the Party's policies in a planned and step-by-step manner last month. First, study Chairman Mao's "Speech at the Cadre Conference in Shanxi-Suiyuan," in order to understand the Party's general line and general policy. Later, they will study Comrade Ren Bishi's report "Several Issues in Land Reform," "Two Documents of 1933," and urban policies, etc., and finally study the Central Committee's "Instructions on Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948," Chapter 2 of "Left-Wing Infantilism." During the study, they will connect with the inspection of the work and thoughts of the agency and themselves. According to the person in charge of the Military Region's Political Department, the study of the Party's policies in the troops has been in a state of laissez-faire for a long time in the past, especially since the "Three Check-ups." The atmosphere of policy study is weak, and whether to read the documents, or read more or less, depends entirely on personal interests. At the political work meeting held in May, representatives of various troops also reflected that when reading Party newspapers in the troops, they only read domestic and foreign military and political news, but rarely read news about land reform and party consolidation, believing that it had little to do with the troops. The result of this neglect of policy study and neglect of Party newspapers has led to serious ideological errors in some comrades on certain specific policies of the Party; some troops in the new areas have directly violated the Party's policies in their actions, damaging the interests of the people and the prestige of the Party. After severely criticizing this phenomenon, the military region leaders pointed out that this purely military viewpoint that does not understand the Party's policies directly violates the Party's army-building principles, and if it continues to exist and develop, it will inevitably cause greater danger. The organization of this study movement is to overcome the above-mentioned thoughts and actions that violate the Party's policies. In the study, two hours of study are guaranteed every day. Among soldiers and miscellaneous personnel, lectures are given on specific issues such as the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention." All departments strictly implement regular daily life and study, overcome the free and undisciplined style of work, and ensure the completion of the study tasks.

　　晋绥军区机关部队
    学习党的政策
    【新华社晋绥三日电】晋绥军区直属机关部队于上月起开始有计划有步骤的学习党的政策。第一、学习毛主席“在晋绥干部会议上的讲话”，以便了解党的总路线和总政策。以后将学习任弼时同志的报告“土地改革中的几个问题”，“一九三三年的两个文件”及城市政策等，最后学习中央“关于一九四八年土改和整党工作指示”，“左派幼稚病”第二章。学习中联系检查本机关和本人的工作和思想。据军区政治部负责人谈，部队中学习党的政策，在过去很长一个时期，特别是“三查”以来，即处于自流状态，学习政策空气淡薄，看不看文件，或看多看少，全凭各人兴趣。在五月举行的政工会议上，各部队代表也都反映部队中阅读党报时只看国内外军事政治新闻，而对土改整党消息则很少阅读，认为与部队关系不大。此种忽视政策学习和忽视党报的结果，已使部分同志在某些党的具体政策上发生严重的思想错误；某些部队在新区更直接在行动上违反了党的政策，损害人民的利益和党的威信。军区首长于严厉批评此种现象后，指出这种不懂得党的政策的单纯军事观点，是直接违背了我党的建军原则，如继续存在和发展，必将造成更大的危险。这次学习运动的组织，就是为了克服上述各种违反党的政策的思想和行动。在学习中，每天保证学习两小时。在战士及杂务人员中，则上课讲解“三大纪律、八项注意”等具体问题。各部均严格实行按时起居习作，克服自由散漫作风，保证学习任务完成。
