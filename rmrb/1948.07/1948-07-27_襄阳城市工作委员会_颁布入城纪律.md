Xinhua News Agency, Xiangyang Front, 24th. The Xiangyang City Work Committee, in order to guarantee the implementation of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Plains Bureau of the Communist Party of China regarding the protection of cities and industrial and commercial policies, promulgated the following entry discipline for organs and troops before the capture of Xiangyang City on the 14th: (1) Organize discipline inspection teams in units of regiments or battalions to enter the city with the attacking troops and be responsible for maintaining discipline. This inspection team is part of the City Work Committee. (2) Troops are only allowed to collect military supplies such as weapons and ammunition abandoned by the enemy. Other public and private materials, as well as unarmed Kuomintang government personnel and police, must not be confiscated or arrested. People should be sent to protect all public and private institutions (prefectural offices, county governments, banks, schools, hospitals, churches, parks, farms, civil education centers, libraries, etc.) and larger stores to prevent sabotage by bad elements. (3) After the battle, all troops should withdraw outside the city, leaving only a small number of troops in the battle area to maintain order until the city defense troops take over. The respective departments will be responsible for any damage or confusion. (4) Each unit will assign appropriate cadres to form a material collection department, which will uniformly collect enemy military supplies under the leadership of the City Work Committee and hand them over to the committee for processing. All transportation vehicles will be managed and used by the material collection department, and troops must not arbitrarily detain or destroy them. (5) Procurement personnel from various troop organs are not allowed to enter the city during the curfew. If necessary, they must obtain a letter of certification from the brigade-level or higher organs and obtain approval from the City Defense Command. Otherwise, the city defense troops may detain and punish them. (6) Units or individuals who do a good job in implementing the policy of protecting the city will be rewarded, and those who do poorly will be punished. Cadres of each unit are responsible for stopping behaviors that violate the city policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Xiangyang Front, 24th. While the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive on the city walls of Xiangyang on the 15th, it surrounded more than 800 enemies entrenched at Baoxinpo, 70 miles south of Nanzhang, including the Nanzhang County Government, the Police Brigade, the Self-Defense Brigade, the Guanghua County Security Police Brigade, and the Yun County Regiment Management District Headquarters. After an hour of battle, the entire enemy was defeated. It is estimated that more than 30 enemies were killed or wounded, and more than 150 people, including Liu Mingli, the head of the pseudo-Nanzhang County Self-Defense Brigade, were captured alive, and 94 various guns were seized.
