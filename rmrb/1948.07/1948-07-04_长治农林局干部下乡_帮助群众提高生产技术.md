　　Taihang News: The Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's agricultural and forestry team, after summarizing the spring plowing and sowing technical work, immediately formulated a work plan for the next stage. On June 3rd, all ten members of the agricultural and forestry team went to the countryside, separately to Li (cheng), Lu (cheng), Xiang (yuan), Chang (zhi) and other counties to help the masses improve production techniques. According to understanding during the sowing period, the "811" millet has been widely promoted in the three special districts and the Xiangyuan, Yushe, and Wuxiang counties of the second special district. In the Xia Village base point of Licheng, the "811" millet planted in eight villages accounted for 22% of the total millet land. In order to enable the masses to master the technology of planting "811" millet, increase yields, and avoid losses, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has made unified arrangements with party and government leaders at all levels, deciding to go deep into the base points, guide the masses, and summarize and exchange experiences. At each base point village, one to three specially invited farmers are planned to be established to set an example, and through them to connect with the masses, so that everyone believes in technology and improves technology. They also organize the masses to topdress. According to actual inspections, this year's previous stage of cultivation was very rough, some places sowed without plowing, and fertilizers were generally not applied as much as last year. In order to make up for this shortcoming, in addition to publicizing and organizing the masses to topdress, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau also worked with the masses to study how to obtain fertilizer more and faster, and how to apply it well and effectively, based on local actual conditions and conditions. They also help the masses to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and test local agents. Since the beginning of spring, due to unfavorable climate, rough work, and unscientific application of manure, insect pests have developed. In Anju Village, Lucheng, more than 300 mu of jade corn was bitten to death by insects. After replanting, there are still insect pests. The Agricultural and Forestry Bureau decided to concentrate some forces, cooperate with the local government, go to the pest-stricken area to establish temporary base points, and organize the masses to fight against insect pests. And make several kinds of local agents: such as Yangtao root,椿tree bark root, tobacco stem water,藜芦, Pinellia and other single agents and mixed agents, first do experiments, get experience and then gradually improve. They also organize the masses to select wheat seeds and promote them locally. This year, "169" wheat has generally developed jaundice, and in some areas the seeds are not pure. In places where jaundice is severe year after year and the masses are unwilling to plant, do not emphasize replanting, and organize the masses to select other local excellent varieties. If they are willing to plant, they will organize seed selection, pull out the miscellaneous ears, and harvest them separately. Choose local excellent wheat varieties, and adopt the seed selection method of Lao Ying and Li Shun last autumn: take the village as a unit, let the masses visit the fields, and after everyone agrees, organize the masses to select seeds and promote them locally.

　　长治农林局干部下乡
    帮助群众提高生产技术
    【太行讯】长治农林局农林组，总结了春耕下种技术工作后，立即订出下一段工作计划。六月三日，农林组十人全部下乡，分别到黎（城）、潞（城）、襄（垣）、长（治）等县帮助群众改进生产技术。据下种期间的了解，三专各县及二专襄垣、榆社、武乡等县，“八一一”谷已普遍推广。黎城霞庄基点八个村所种“八一一”谷占谷地总数百分之二十二。为了使群众掌握种植“八一一”谷的技术，增加产量，避免损失，农林局已和各级党政领导作了统一布置，决定深入基点，指导群众，总结交流经验。在各基点村有计划的建立一至三户特约农家，做出榜样来，通过他们去连系群众，使大家相信技术，提高技术。他们同时组织群众上追肥。根据实际检查，今年前一段的耕作很不精细，部分地方没犁地就下了种，肥料普遍没有去年上的多。为弥补这个缺点，农林局除了宣传组织群众上追肥外，并和群众根据当地实际情况和条件，研究如何做到肥料来的又多又快，上的好，起作用。他们也帮助群众防除病虫害，试验土药剂。入春以来，因气候不和，工作粗糙，上粪不科学，致虫害发展。潞城安居一村，即有三百多亩玉茭被虫咬死，重种后仍有虫害。农林局决集中一部分力量，配合当地政府，到虫害区建立临时基点，组织群众向虫害作斗争。并作出几种土药剂：如杨桃根、椿树皮根、烟茎水、藜卢、半夏等单剂与混合剂，先作试验，取得经验再逐步提高。他们也组织群众进行小麦选种，就地推广。“一六九”小麦今年普遍发生黄疸，有些地区种子不纯了。在连年黄疸严重，群众不愿种的地方，不强调再种，组织群众另选本地优良品种。愿种地的则组织选种，拔掉杂穗，单割单打。选择本地小麦优良品种，采用劳英李顺去年秋天的选种办法：以村为单位，让群众田间参观，大家同意后，再组织群众选种，就地推广。
