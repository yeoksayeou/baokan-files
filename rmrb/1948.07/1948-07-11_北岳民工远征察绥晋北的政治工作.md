　　Political Work of Beiyue Laborers on the Expedition to Chahar, Suiyuan, and Northern Shanxi
　　　　Jie Bing, Yu Fu
　　[Beiyue News] During the Chahar South, Suiyuan East, and Northern Shanxi campaigns this spring, cadres from various counties in the Beiyue District leading the laborers, carried out propaganda, mobilization, and education work at all times. Coupled with the exemplary role of Communist Party members, they successfully consolidated the troops and completed the enormous task of supporting the front.
　　　　Mobilization Work Before Departure
　　After the laborers from various counties were assembled, the county and district cadres conducted political mobilization, explaining the current situation and tasks, departure time, and matters requiring attention. They also guaranteed that the villages would ensure production and cultivation on behalf of the laborers, and fairly and reasonably distribute land and the fruits of victory. This dispelled the laborers' concerns ideologically and consolidated the troops. After the Baobei Campaign, Tang County laborers established a echelon organization, equipped with personnel for rotation expeditions. Every stretcher team had a Communist Party member as a backbone. The establishment of branch organizations ensured the consolidation of the support-the-front teams. Before departure, the masses of Tang County and the departing laborers held a joint celebration, where the support-the-front laborers proposed: 1. No desertion, no returning home without completing the task; 2. Guarantee mutual assistance and friendship, and unity of purpose after departure; 3. No violation of mass discipline; 4. Deserters are willing to be punished by the masses and compensate for cultivation work. Subsequently, the masses also proposed: Guarantee to cultivate the land well for the support-the-front laborers, deliver manure, and solve all family difficulties, dispelling the laborers' ideological concerns and enhancing their confidence in completing the task. However, the leadership of Pingshan lacked ideological preparation for the support-the-front work, lacked pre-organization education for the laborers, and lacked in-depth political mobilization when the task arrived. They were temporarily assembled, neither sending strong cadres to lead nor establishing sound branch organizations, resulting in desertions among the laborers.
　　　　Political Work During the March
　　This time, the laborers' expedition covered more than two thousand li. It went through the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. They crossed grasslands, rivers, climbed high mountains, coupled with enemy aircraft harassment, the laborers were very arduous. However, the vast majority of laborers' marching order was always in order, emotions often full, the reason is that there is a strong political work and party members' backbone guarantee. When the main force advanced to Tianzhen, they climbed a very high mountain, the cold wind made breathing difficult. Zhang Chun, a Pingshan stretcher team member, was frozen because of his thin clothes. The fifth company commander and deputy company commander immediately took action, carrying him on a stretcher; and mobilized everyone to say: "Grit your teeth, through the coldest place, the bottom of the hill is the campsite." The brigade cadres also encouraged: "Walking on the snow mountain is really hard. Talking about hardship after suffering is also a person" (person means happy). When crossing the Sanggan River, the river was not long after the thaw, the water was turbulent. Thirty-five laborers from Lingshou and Lingqiu counties fell into the water due to the damage of the pontoon bridge. The leadership immediately mobilized to rescue them, proposing: "Crossing the Sanggan River is like fighting a battle, saving a person is a merit." Comrades such as Kang Sheng, Kang Er'ao, Liu Bu Lai, Zhao Tangji, Zhao Zhengfa... and others bravely rescued the drowning people. On the night of March 28, the Pingshan militia marched from Machishi to Shuang Gucheng, it began to rain as soon as they set off, the wind was cold and the sky was dark, the gullies were deep and the road was slippery, and some team members were in low spirits. At this time, the leadership proposed: "Today's heavy rain, enjoy peace in the future." After arriving at the village, they told everyone stories of heroes suffering, stabilizing everyone's emotions. Some laborers did not want to march at night, complaining: "Why not walk during the day." At that time, they explained: "Airplanes bomb during the day, the target is small at night, and it is easy to keep military secrets." After the laborers understood, the complaints decreased. During the march, the slogan of promoting mutual assistance and friendship was put forward, many cadres carried luggage for the laborers (such as the Huolu Labor Brigade Captain, Political Commissar, etc.), and the laborers also took things for each other, improving the laborers' emotions. During enemy air raids, An Xiyun, the squad leader of Huolu, who made great contributions, immediately shouted to his class: "Disperse and lie down on the spot, running around is a big loss, running away and losing contact is even more dangerous, we came out together, go back together." In this way, they were not bombed several times.
　　　　Political Work in Camps
　　Before the camp, it is necessary to explain the situation of the house every time, explain that when the distribution is not good, do not go in casually, explain that respect the local customs, resolutely implement the three major disciplines and eight points for attention. Make the laborers ideologically prepared. Once, due to housing difficulties, 60 Pingshan laborers lived in three rooms. Everyone not only had no complaints, but also proposed three major guarantees for the camp: 1. Don't let the landlord say no after leaving; 2. Guarantee that the landlord's things will not be lost; 3. Guarantee that the landlord has water to drink. Huolu laborers cleaned the yards and streets wherever they went, and fetched water for the landlords. Many laborers also publicized the policies of the liberated areas to the masses, the land reform of farmers turning over, and the democratic life of the people. When leaving, they proposed "Three Clean" (house clean, yard clean, street clean), "Three Full" (water tank full, landlord satisfied, village cadres satisfied), "Three Checks" (check whether the team members have taken things, check whether the landlord has lost things, check whether the quartermaster has settled accounts with the village). When the third company of Jingxing was camping in Shizhangfang, west of Ying County City, a landlord poured water on the kang, unwilling to let the laborers live, after the laborers lived in, they helped him produce and fetch water, and talked to them about the life of the people in the liberated areas, the relationship gradually improved. When leaving, the landlord sent them out and said: "Come to my house again in the future; you are really good!" Sure enough, the second time they went, the landlord pulled them in. In combat situations, it is often necessary to camp in the open, at this time, it is necessary to make timely mobilization work. When the first and second troops of Lingqiu laborers were camping in Lige Pagoda area of Fengzhen, the weather was very cold, and the emotions of the team members fluctuated slightly. The leadership immediately explained: "Distributed housing may be lost, collective camping suffers a little, but it will not be lost, you see, the troop leaders are not camping like us?" After the explanation, the team members' emotions stabilized. When the Lingqiu laborers were camping in Tuanbao, there were many people and few houses, many cadres and party members were willing to camp outside, letting the laborers live in the house, which moved many laborers. When the Tang County laborers were camping in Dongwafang, they proposed the slogan of "mutual assistance and friendship", some in the house gave their leather jackets to the laborers camping outside, and the second row automatically let the first row live in the house, and they lived in the yard.
　　　　Rescuing the Wounded Under Fire
　　After our army engaged the enemy, many laborers often rushed to the front line to rescue the wounded. The Tang County Labor Corps convened a meeting of activists before the war, organized the backbone to take the lead. At the beginning of the battle, it loudly proposed: "The army is fighting in front, we are following behind, the wounded must be rescued." The Lingshou laborers were surrounded by the enemy on three sides in Ying County. The squad leader Xin Quanlai carried a wounded soldier and never let go, and told the wounded soldier: "If I am here, you are here." When the enemy approached, he took the wounded soldier's gun and retreated while fighting, finally escaping. Their heroic and courageous spirit won the commendation and praise of the troop leaders.

　　北岳民工远征察绥晋北的政治工作
    捷兵　玉夫
    【北岳讯】今春察南绥东晋北战役队，北岳区各县领导民工的干部，随时展开宣传鼓动教育工作，再加上共产党员的模范作用，胜利的巩固了部队，完成了支前的巨大任务。
    　　　　出发前的动员工作
    各县民工集中后，县区干部都进行了政治动员，说明目前形势和任务，出征时间及应注意的事项。并提出村里保证生产代耕，公平合理的分配土地和胜利果实。从思想上解除了民工的顾虑，巩固了部队。唐县民工在保北战役后，就建立了梯队组织配备人员，轮流出征。每付担架都有党员作骨干。建立了支部组织，保证了支前队伍的巩固。出发前，唐县群众和出征民工召开联欢大会，支前民工提出：一、不开小差，不完成任务不回家；二、出发后，保证互助友爱，团结一心；三、不违犯群众纪律；四、开小差愿受群众处分，并补还代耕工。接着群众也提出：保证给支前民工种好地，送上粪，并解决家庭的一切困难，解除了民工的思想顾虑，提高了民工完成任务的信心。但平山领导上对支前工作思想准备不够，对民工事前没有组织教育，任务到来又缺乏深入的政治动员，临时调凑，既未派出坚强干部领导，又未建立健全的支部组织，于是出现了民工逃亡的现象。
    　　　　行军中的政治工作
    此次民工远征，行程两千多里。历经冀、晋、察、绥四省。过草原，渡大河，爬高山，再加上敌机的骚扰，民工是很艰苦的。但绝大多数民工的行军秩序始终不乱，情绪经常饱满，原因就是有坚强的政治工作和党员的骨干保证。主力进军天镇的时候，爬过一个很高的山，冷风吹得呼吸都很困难。平山担架队张春因衣服单薄冻坏了，五连正副连长，立即亲自动手，用担架抬着走；并动员大家说：“咬紧牙关，通过最冷的地方，下岭就是宿营地。”大队干部也鼓动说：“走雪山，真是苦。苦后谈苦也是人”（人是愉快的意思）。渡桑乾河时，解冻不久，水势凶猛，灵寿，灵邱两县民工三十五名因浮桥损坏，失足落水。领导上立即动员下水抢救，提出：“过桑乾河好比打一仗，救下人的记一功”。康生、康二熬、刘簿来、赵堂吉、赵正发……等同志奋不顾身，将落水者救起。三月二十八日黑夜，平山民兵从马池石向双古城进军，一出发就下起大雨来，风寒天黑，沟深路滑，有些队员情绪很低。这时领导上提出：“今天大雨淋，今后享太平”。到村之后，又给大家讲英雄受苦的故事，安定了大家的情绪。有些民工不愿夜行军，埋怨：“为什么白天不走”。当时又给解释：“白天飞机炸，黑夜目标小，又容易保守军事秘密”。民工们闹清后，怨言减少了。行军中提出发扬互助友爱的口号，不少干部替民工背行李（如获鹿民工大队长、政委等），民工也互相拿东西，提高了民工的情绪。在敌机袭扰的时候，获鹿立了大功的班长安喜云，立即向他班的人喊出：“就地分散卧倒，乱跑要吃大亏，跑散失掉连系更危险，咱们一块出来，一块回。”这样几次都没被炸着。
    　　　　宿营中的政治工作
    宿营前，每次都要说明房子的情况，说明没有分配好的时候，不要随便进去，说明要尊重当地的民情风俗，坚决执行三大纪律八项注意。使民工思想上有所准备。一次因房子困难，平山民工六十人住了三间，大家不但毫无怨言，并提出宿营的三大保证：一、走后不让房东说不是；二、保证房东东西不受损失；三、保证房东有水吃。获鹿民工每到一处，即打扫院子和街道，给房东挑水。不少的民工并向群众宣传解放区的政策，土地改革农民翻身及老百姓的民主生活等。临走时提出“三净”（屋净、院净、街道净），“三满”（水缸挑满、房东满意、村干部满意），“三查”（查队员是否拿了东西、查房东是否丢了东西、查司务长是否和村里算清帐）。井陉三连在应县城西师长坊宿营时，一家房东在炕上泼了水，不愿叫民工住，民工们住下后，帮他生产挑水，和他们谈解放区人民的生活，关系逐渐搞好了。走时房东送出门来说：“以后来了还到咱家住；你们真好！”果然第二次一去，房东便把他们拉进去了。在战斗情况下常常需要露营，这时又须要及时作动员工作。灵邱民工一二部队在丰镇里圪塔一带露营时，天气很冷，队员情绪稍有波动。领导上立即解释：“分散有房住，可能受损失，集体露营受点罪，但是不会受损失，你们看，部队首长不是和咱一样露营吗？”解释后队员情绪安定了。灵邱民工在团堡宿营时，人多房少，不少干部、党员情愿在外面露营，让民工们住在家里，感动了好多民工。唐县民工在东瓦房宿营时，提出了“互助友爱”的口号，有些在房子里的，便将皮袄给外面露营的民工穿，二排自动让一排住在房里，自己住在院里。
    　　　　炮火下抢救伤员
    当我军和敌人接火后，不少民工往往冲到最前线抢救伤员。唐县的民工团在战前就召开了积极分子会，组织骨干起带头作用。在战斗一开始又响亮的提出：“军队前面打，咱们后面跟，伤员一定要抢下来”。灵寿民工在应县曾被敌人三面包围，班长辛全来背着一个伤员始终不放，并告伤员说：“有我就有你。”当敌人迫近时，他拿了伤员的枪边打边退，终于脱险了。他们这种英勇果敢的精神，获得了部队首长的嘉奖和表扬。
