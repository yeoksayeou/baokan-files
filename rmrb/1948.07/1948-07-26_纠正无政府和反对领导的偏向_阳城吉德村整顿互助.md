[Taiyue Dispatch] Jide Village, Yangcheng, held a joint meeting on the 9th of this month, including 78 village cadres and mutual aid team leaders, to review the two reasons for the loose organization of mutual aid teams: First, after the cadres corrected deviations, they thought that "serving the masses" and "promoting democracy and freedom" meant "the masses can do whatever they want" and "do whatever the masses tell them to do," making them feel constrained and afraid to lead boldly. Liu Wang originally didn't participate in mutual aid with anyone. This year, when planting corn, he asked the team leader to send people to help. When everyone didn't go, the team leader and squad leader, in order to "serve the masses," took the lead in helping, which caused dissatisfaction among the whole team. Second, a few people thought they had "democracy and freedom" and could "do whatever they want" in the team and didn't obey leadership. Cadre Li Huaiquan said: "When we went to inspect mutual aid, we saw everyone doing their own thing, and when we asked a question, someone immediately retorted: This is 'freedom,' can you force me? We dare not say anything afterward, dare not lead." Based on these situations, everyone discussed in groups and decided on the following methods to overcome this laissez-faire tendency in the future. First, everyone has the freedom to participate in the mutual aid team. Joining or leaving the team is at each person's discretion, but once participating, they should abide by the team's rules, equal exchange, reasonable exchange of labor, democratic discussion, and joint implementation. Second, the difficulties of team members should be solved together, but they must be solved reasonably, exchanging labor for labor, and not harming the interests of others, to "serve" a few people. That night, each team held a meeting and re-established voluntary combinations. A total of 59 small mutual aid teams were reorganized in the village. Everyone freely joined or left the teams, and some opportunistic people were "isolated" by everyone. After the rectification, it happened to rain. The next morning, when they went to the fields, all 546 mu of stubble soybeans in the village were planted before lunch. The masses said: If we hadn't rectified the mutual aid, the replanting would have been delayed.

　　纠正无政府和反对领导的偏向
  　阳城吉德村整顿互助
    【太岳电】阳城吉德村在本月九日召开包括七十八个村干部和互助组小组长的联席会上，检讨互助组散漫的两个原因：第一是干部纠偏以后，思想上认为“为群众服务”“发扬民主自由”就是“群众想干啥就干啥”“群众叫干啥就干啥”，弄的束手束脚，不敢大胆领导。刘旺本来就不和人互助，今年种玉茭时，要求组长派人帮助，大家不去，组长和分队长为了“为群众服务”，就带头去帮助，引起了全组不满。第二、有少数人以为“民主自由”，在组内“想怎样就怎样”，不服从领导。干部李怀全说：“咱去检查互助，看见大家各干各的，就问了一句，立刻有人顶嘴说：这是‘自由’，你还能强迫？咱以后就不敢吭气，不敢领导。”根据这些情况，大家分组讨论决定了今后克服这种散漫自流的办法。一、参加互助组，人人有自由，入组退组由各人自便，但参加了就应遵守组里的制度，等价交换，合理变工，民主讨论，共同执行。二、组员的困难共同设法解决，但须合理解决，变工还工，不能损害别人的利益，为少数人“服务”。当天夜里，各组都开了会，重新自愿结合。全村计重新结合了五十九个小型互助组。大家自由出组进组，有些讨巧的人被大家“孤立”出去了。整顿后刚巧下了雨，第二天一早上地，赶午饭时全村五百四十六亩回茬豆子就全部种完了。群众说：要不整顿互助，回茬还要误事哩。
