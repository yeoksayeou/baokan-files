Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS reports: On July 15th, Rome held a mass rally organized by the Rome Federation of Trade Unions and the People's Democratic Front to protest the conspiracy to assassinate Togliatti. Approximately 50,000 working people attended. Italian Communist Party Deputy Secretary Longo stated in his speech that the life of a Communist leader is a treasure not only for the nation but also internationally, and the working class and all working people must unite to protect it. The attempt on Togliatti's life proves that Gasperi's slogan of "winning at any cost" has led the government and its accomplices down the path of physically eliminating the opposition party. Now, the working people are demanding an end to the policies against the people. The only guarantee for changing this policy is the resignation of the Gasperi government, to be replaced by a government capable of protecting the interests of the nation and the working people. The audience enthusiastically applauded Longo's speech and demanded the government's resignation. Socialist Senator Bertini (formerly translated as Fei Dingni) delivered a speech stating that the responsibility for the crime lies with the government of Gasperi, Scelba (Minister of Interior), and Saragat. If the government insists on staying in power, the day will come when it will be swept away by the people. Bertini shouted: We have fought alongside our Communist comrades in the past for freedom, and in the future, we will continue to work hand in hand with them forever. After the rally, the masses marched to the hospital where Togliatti was recovering to express their concern for the Communist leader.

　　抗议反动派谋杀托格里亚蒂罪行！
    罗马五万群众举行抗议大会
  　要求反动政府辞职
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社报导：七月十五日，罗马举行了由罗马工会委员会及人民民主阵线所召集的抗议谋杀托格里亚蒂阴谋的群众大会，到会劳动人民约五万人。意共副书记隆哥在大会上演说称，共产党领袖的生命，不仅是国家的而且是国际的财宝，工人阶级和一切劳动人民，必须联合起来加以保卫。对托格里亚蒂生命的谋害，证明了加斯贝利的“不惜以任何代价取胜”的口号，已使政府及其同谋者，走上从肉体上消灭反对党的道路。现在，劳动人民正要求结束反对人民的政策。改变这一政策的唯一保证，是加斯贝利政府的辞职，而代以能够保护国家利益和劳动人民利益的政府。听众对隆哥的演说热烈欢呼，并要求政府辞职。社会党参议员柏蒂尼（前译为斐丁尼）发表演说称，罪行的责任在于加斯贝利、谢尔巴（内政部长）和萨拉盖特的政府。如果政府欲坚持执政，则总有一天，它将会被人民所扫除。柏蒂尼高呼：我们过去曾与共产党同志为争取自由而共同斗争，今后，我们仍将与他们永远携手并进。大会结束后，群众即列队前往托格里亚蒂疗伤的医院，表示他们对共产党领袖的关切。
