　　Xinhua News Agency, Xiangyang Front, July 28th: A front-line reporter reports the detailed process of capturing Kang Ze alive. At five o'clock on the morning of the 16th, the street fighting in Xiangyang City developed to the core fortress of the Kang bandit headquarters on the city wall. When the People's Liberation Army's artillery shells destroyed a bunker, the soldiers broke into the courtyard, and after fighting for more than ten minutes in the yard, the enemy surrendered. Then, the entire army began to search for the special agent leader Kang Ze.

　　In the first layer of the middle bunker, the soldiers captured a large fat man and asked him if he was Kang Ze. He replied: Commander Kang just ran away, I am Deputy Commander Guo Xunqi.

　　It was already afternoon, and Kang Ze had not been found yet, everyone was very anxious. A certain regiment commander ordered Deputy Instructor An Bingren to take a few communications soldiers, led by Fu Qirong, a captured lieutenant follower of Kang Ze, to search again. Fu Qirong led them to a tunnel below the entrance of the Kang bandit headquarters. It was damp and narrow, and nothing could be seen; the stuffy and bloody smell made people nauseous. Corpses were lying horizontally and vertically. They turned on flashlights and groped forward step by step. Following the tunnel, they turned to the right, and it was still full of dead bodies. They walked further and felt strange. There was no fierce battle here, so why were there so many dead bodies!

　　Walking forward, there was a stone staircase. Climbing up the stone staircase, they went down into a very deep pit. Everyone bent over and continued to move forward. The cave was so suffocating that they could not breathe. At this time, they suddenly saw a hole, with a dead body stuffed in the opening, and brains and blood were still dripping. They dragged the corpse away and saw five dead bodies inside. Suddenly, one of the corpses stood up, and everyone was startled. Kang Ze's follower turned around and ran out, but the communication soldier grabbed him. He gasped and said, "I dare not see him, that is Kang Ze." An Bingren shone a flashlight on him, and the guy fell down again, motionless. An Bingren asked, "Quick, tell me if you are Kang Ze?" After waiting for a long time, he uttered a weak voice: "I am an officer, take me out first!" The communication soldier dragged him out. As soon as he came out of the tunnel, some of the captives were saying, "The commander is captured." As soon as this guy heard this, he lay down again and refused to get up. The soldiers gathered around, some said: "You big special agent leader, how many people have you killed? You must pay back the blood debt." Some said: "You released poison gas and poisoned people to death, you must pay for your life." Everyone looked at the appearance of this big special agent in the twilight. His face, head, hands, and feet were covered with mud, and some dead people's blood was smeared on him. The grass-green American military uniform was covered with blood and mud and no longer looked like anything. Lying on the ground, he looked like a dead pig. No matter how everyone dragged him, he remained motionless. Everyone was extremely angry, and one soldier said: "Don't play dead, if you don't get up, I will beat you!" The dead Kang Ze heard that he was going to be beaten, and obediently got up. The soldiers escorted him to the front-line headquarters, changed his clothes, and washed his face. Everyone could see his ugly appearance with a high forehead, thick eyebrows, square face, and big ears. A little skin was scratched on both arms by shrapnel, and the injury was not serious, but his first sentence was: "Does your department have a doctor? Will my arms be disabled?"

　　活捉康泽详情
    【新华社襄阳前线二十八日电】前线记者报导：活捉康泽的详细经过。十六日上午五点钟，襄阳城的巷战发展到城墙康匪司令部的核心堡垒。当解放军的炮弹摧毁了一个碉堡，战士们突入围墙，在院子里打了十几分钟，敌人就缴了械。于是，全军开始搜捕特务头子康泽。
    在中间大碉堡的第一层，战士们捉住了一个大胖子，问他是不是康泽？他回答说：康司令刚跑不久，我是副司令郭勋祺。
    时间已是下午，康泽还没找到，大家都很着急。某团团长命令副教导员安秉仁带几个通讯员，由被俘的康泽的少尉随从傅起戎作向导再去搜索。傅起戎领着他们在康匪司令部门口下面，找到一条地道，阴湿而狭窄，什么也看不见；闷热和血腥臭味，使人发呕。尸体横一个竖一个的躺着，他们打着电筒一步一步摸索前进。顺着地道向右侧一拐，死尸还是堆的满满的，他们越走越奇怪，这地方并没有激烈的战斗，为什么有这么多死尸呢！
    再向前走有一个石梯，爬上石梯，接着又往下走到一个很深的大坑里，大家弯着腰继续前进，洞里窒息得他们都透不过气来。这时他们忽然看见一洞，洞口上塞着一个死尸，脑浆和血水还在一滴一滴地流着。他们把尸体拖开，看见里面有五具死尸，猛的有一具尸体爬了起来，大家都吓了一跳，康泽的那个随从，却转身就往外跑，通讯员一把抓住他，他喘喘的说：“我不敢见他，那就是康泽。”安秉仁用电筒一照，那家伙又猛地倒下去，一动也不动了。安秉仁问：“快说你是不是康泽？”等了许久，他才发出微弱的声音来：“我是一个军官，把我弄出去再说吧！”通讯员把他拖出来，刚出地道，俘虏中就有人在说：“司令捉住了。”这家伙一听，又猛地躺下，死也不起来了。战士们围拢起来，有的说：“你这个大特务头子，你杀死了多少老百姓，要你还血债。”有的说：“你放毒气，毒死的人你要偿命。”大家在黄昏中看了看这个大特务的样子，满脸满头满手满脚都用污泥抹遍了，还抹了些死人的血，草绿色的美国军衣，被血和污泥涂得已不象样子，躺在地下活象一条死猪，大家怎样拖他也始终不动。大家气极了，有一个战士说：“不要装死，再不起来老子就揍你！”装死的康泽听说要揍，乖乖的爬了起来。战士们把他押到前线司令部，给他换了衣服，洗了脸，大家才看清他那高额头，粗眉毛，方脸大耳那副丑样。两膀被炮弹片檫破了一点皮，本来伤得并不厉害，但他第一句话就问：“贵部有医生没有？我的膀子该不会残废吧。”
