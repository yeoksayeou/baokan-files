[Hebei-Henan News] Various social strata in Wuyi ChengGuan (town within the walls) are boiling salt and leaching saltpeter, making significant profits. In order to support the masses in developing the saltpeter industry, the Nitre and Sulphur Bureau invited a group of experienced workers from Ji County to Wuyi in December last year to start leaching. The leaching was abundant and of high quality, generating considerable income. Seeing the clear profitability of saltpeter leaching, the masses began to engage in it themselves. Cao Lanling and Zhang Menggeng from South Street organized six people, producing over a hundred catties of saltpeter per month, earning 84,000 yuan (Hebei-Henan currency). This concrete fact further solidified the masses' confidence in saltpeter leaching. In just a few days, forty households in East Street started leaching. Women in North Street also organized themselves to learn leaching. They were highly motivated, often scraping soil all night and preparing the pools early in the morning. During the busy farming season, men did the heavy work of pushing soil, filling pools, and draining water early in the morning and late at night, while women and children scraped soil, watched the pools, and added water at home. All social strata participated in this beneficial sideline. The landlord Li Shigen from North Street, with his entire family of ten, leached a total of 350 catties of saltpeter and 1,200 catties of salt from December last year to the present, earning 77,000 yuan and over 600 catties of wheat, enabling the whole family to have enough to eat and wear. The rich peasant Yang Yuting from East Street earned 1,200 catties of wheat and 52,800 yuan in fifty days, equivalent to the harvest of more than ten mu of wheat fields. Small merchant Xu Guozheng said, "I truly regret not leaching saltpeter earlier. Now, after leaching two pots, I have yielded more than forty catties, which can earn more than 200 catties of wheat, equivalent to a spring's worth of trading." The lazy men Zhang Zhentao and Wei Peifen (female) also participated in saltpeter leaching and earned a lot of money. According to incomplete statistics, out of 482 households in ChengGuan, 282 households were leaching saltpeter. According to the Nitre and Sulphur Bureau's statistics from January to May, a total of over 27,300 catties of saltpeter were collected, expending over 62,000 catties of wheat and over 21 million yuan.
