Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. According to a report in the Tianjin New Star newspaper on the 9th of last month, describing the miserable lives of people in the Chiang-controlled areas around Haizhou, northern Jiangsu: In and out of Haizhou and Guanyun cities, starving people are collapsing on the roads every day; even more are starving to death at home. A teacher surnamed Wu in Haizhou, along with his family of six, committed suicide by taking poison because they could not bear the hunger. Selling children is happening everywhere, especially in Xinpu. A child around ten years old is priced at 100,000 to 150,000 Chiang currency, which is equivalent to the price of a few pounds of corn (at that time, corn sold for 5 million per shi), with straw markers stuck in their hair, led by their parents while crying and shouting, but there are many sellers and very few buyers. It is also learned that since shortly after the autumn harvest last year, riots of rice looting have continuously broken out in Xinpu, Haizhou, Guanyun, and Lianyungang and other places. According to the newspaper: Dozens or hundreds of starving people have repeatedly robbed grain shops in Xinpu; in Banpu and other places, starving people are grabbing food on the streets and alleys every day, saying, "If we don't rob, we will starve to death anyway!" Even the Chiang's police are helpless. According to the newspaper, the Chiang bandit gang, in its narrow-controlled area, has stationed an entire 44th Division, a salt affairs tax police regiment of about 6,000 people, and the Home Return Corps and other local troops, demanding grain and grass from the starving people on their last breath. "As soon as the township and village chiefs' apportionment list comes out, men and women cry, and even if they don't have money, they have to pay." The burden is heavy, and the area planted with wheat is less than half. Now that the new wheat has not yet come on the market, the Chiang government has already decided on the first wheat levy, uniformly collecting 14 catties per mu. In addition, there are office expenses for the district, township, and bao, and countless apportionments, making the people's only hope (the wheat harvest) vanish before their eyes.

　　在蒋匪残酷搜刮下
  　海州人民奄奄待毙
    【新华社陕北十九日电】据上月九日天津新星报报导在国民党统治下的苏北海州一带蒋区人民生活的惨状称：海州、灌云城内外，每天都有饥民倒毙路途；饿死在家中者更多。海州一位姓吴的教师，一家六口因不堪饥饿，竟全家服毒而死。卖儿鬻女的到处都是，尤以新浦为最多。一个十岁左右的小孩标价蒋币十万元至十五万元，即相当于几斤苞米的价钱（当时苞米每市石卖五百万元），头插草标，由父母牵着且喊且哭，但卖者甚多，买者极少。另悉：自去年秋收后不久，新浦、海州、灌云及连云港等地即不断爆发抢米骚动。据该报称：新浦地方已屡次发生数十数百饥民抢粮行米店的事件，在板浦等地，大街小巷每天都有饥民抢食事件发生，他们说：“不抢也是饿死，反正都是死！”弄得蒋记警察也无可奈何。据该报透露：蒋匪在其狭小的统治地区中，驻着整四十四师一个师、盐务税警团约六千人及还乡队与其他地方部队，向奄奄一息的饥民要粮要草，“乡镇保长的摊派名单一出，民间男哭女号，没有钱，也要出”。负担苛重，种麦面积不足半数，现在新麦尚未登场，蒋政府便已决定第一次麦征，按每亩十四斤一律征收，此外还有区、乡、保的办公费及不可胜计的种种摊派；使人民唯一的希望（麦收）眼见又归于乌有了。
