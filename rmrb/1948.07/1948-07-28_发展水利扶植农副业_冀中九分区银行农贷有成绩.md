[Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong Ninth Sub-district Branch of the Border Region Bank has achieved great success in issuing agricultural loans over the past four months. As of the end of June, a total of 8,254,150,000 yuan (border currency) has been issued, along with over 630,000 catties of grain. This has supported the masses in digging 3,920 new wells, repairing 14,300 old wells, purchasing 1,498 waterwheels, repairing 1,404 waterwheels, and purchasing 1,571 head of livestock (the above figures do not include purchases and repairs made independently using floating assets). 6,292 various production teams have been organized. This round of agricultural loans has the following characteristics: (1) It implemented the spirit of prioritizing water conservancy. Water conservancy loans accounted for 47% of the total agricultural loans, agriculture accounted for 29.5%, and sideline production accounted for 23.5%. In counties where water conservancy work was carried out relatively well (such as Anguo), the water conservancy portion accounted for 80.5%. Xinle, Anping, and Shenze were all around 50% or 60%. (2) When issuing agricultural loans, attention was paid to organizing private capital and floating assets. In April, 311,340,000 yuan of private capital and floating assets were organized, and in May, 1,139,450,000 yuan were organized. In June, Anguo issued a total of 1,946,610,000 yuan in loans and organized 2,798,120,000 yuan in private capital and floating assets, exceeding the loan amount. (3) There was a shift away from the simple perspective of only lending to poor peasants and hired laborers without lending to middle peasants and other classes, instead of focusing on non-productive relief, with the goal of lending to help peasants of all classes with production. In Anguo in April and May, there were 3,496 loan recipients, of which 2,476 were poor peasants (accounting for over 70% of the total), and 1,020 were middle peasants (over 29%); loans to poor peasants accounted for 76%, and loans to middle peasants accounted for 24%. (4) The spirit of lending actual goods at actual value was implemented. In sideline production, loans were provided for cotton and saltpeter pots; in agriculture, loans were provided for grain; in water conservancy, the Anguo Promotion Society lent out 60 waterwheels. The Shenze Promotion Society supported the establishment of eight kilns, which produced more than 300,000 bricks in May, solving the problem of bricks for well digging. Since the district party committee called for loans to be based on actual value in May, by the end of June, according to statistics from four counties, over 900 million yuan had been converted to actual value, and 299,909 catties of grain. The sub-district also faces some urgent problems in its lending work. In the issuance of loans, some cadres still hold non-productive relief views and have not fully grasped that loans are for the development of production and should mainly be given to poor and middle peasants who are actively producing but have more difficulties, while also lending to landlords and rich peasants who are willing to engage in production. In Anguo's Fourth District, water conservancy loans were not given to middle peasants; in a well-digging team in the Fifth District, two members were originally rich peasants, and the entire team was therefore unable to obtain a loan. Many agricultural loan cadres have not distinguished between loans and relief, and have the idea of using loans to "fill poverty pits." Some villages have few floating assets, so they use loans to fill the gap, and agricultural loans cannot truly play a role in supporting production. Some cadres do not understand that loans should be continuous and frequently rotated in order to play their due role in supporting production, and do not pay enough attention to the inspection and recovery of agricultural loans; some people have used water conservancy loans to build houses, and a few have even used loans for gambling. Regarding the development of mass credit cooperation, many agricultural loan cadres are still unclear. They do not understand that the fundamental way to truly and universally solve the financial difficulties of the masses is to use loans to help establish new borrowing and lending relationships among the masses and to carry out mass credit cooperation movements. They only complain that the agricultural loans distributed from above are too few, and do not pay attention to organizing village cooperatives, or to trying out mass credit cooperative organizations in a planned and focused manner.

　　发展水利扶植农副业
  　冀中九分区银行农贷有成绩
    【冀中电】边区银行冀中九分区支行，四个月来发放农贷收到很大成绩。截至六月底，共发出八十二亿五千四百一十五万元（边币，下同）。贷出粮食六十三万余斤。扶植群众打新井三千九百二十眼，修旧井一万四千三百眼；买水车一千四百九十八辆，修理水车一千四百零四辆，买牲口一千五百七十一头。（以上未包括单独用浮财购买及修理数），组织各种生产小组六千二百九十二个。这次发放农贷有以下几个特点：（一）贯彻了以水利为重点的精神。水利贷款占农贷总数百分之四十七，农业占百分之二十九点五，副业占百分之二三点五。水利工作开展较好的县份（如安国），水利部分占百分之八十点五。新乐、安平、深泽均在百分之五、六十左右。（二）发放农贷时，注意了组织私资与浮财。四月份组织私资浮财三亿一千一百三十四万元，五月份组织私资浮财达十一亿三千九百四十五万元。六月份安国共贷款十九亿四千六百六十一万元，组织私资浮财二十七亿九千八百一十二万元，超过了贷款数。（三）开始转变了单纯贫雇观点，只贷款给贫雇不贷给中农及其他阶层的非生产的救济，作到贷款帮助各阶层农民生产。安国四、五月份贷款户为三四九六户，其中贫农二四七六户（占总户数百分之七十强），中农一零二零户（百分之二十九强）；贫农贷款占百分之七十六，中农贷款占百分之二十四。（四）贯彻了贷实折实的精神。在副业上贷棉、贷硝锅，在农业上贷粮食；在水利上，安国推进社贷出水车六十辆。深泽推进社扶植起八个窑，五月份制成三十余万砖，解决了打井用砖的问题。贷款自五月份区党委号召贷款折实后，至六月底，据四个县统计，已折实九亿余元，折粮二九九九零九斤。该分区在贷款工作上，同时还存在一些急待解决的问题。发放贷款中，某些干部仍然存在非生产的救济观点，没有很好掌握贷款是为了发展生产，主要是贷给积极生产困难较多的贫雇中农，同时也贷给愿意生产的地主富农的原则。安国四区在水利贷款时不贷给中农；五区一村打井组，其中有两个原富农成份，全组因此未贷到款。有许多农贷干部未分清贷款和救济的区别，存在着用贷款“填穷坑”的想法。有些村庄浮财少，就以贷款填补，农贷不能真正发挥扶持生产的作用。有些干部不懂得贷款应川流不息，经常周转，才能起扶值生产的应有作用，对农贷的检查与收回工作重视不够，有人借了水利贷款盖了房子，少数人甚至以贷款赌钱。关于开展群众信用合作问题，许多农贷干部还认识不清。不懂得真正普遍解决群众资金的困难，基本方法是以贷款帮助建立群众新的借贷关系，开展群众信用合作运动，只是抱怨上面分下来的农贷太少，对村社却不注意整理，或有计划，有重点的试办群众信用合作组织。
