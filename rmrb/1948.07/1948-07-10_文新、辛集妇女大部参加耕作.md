(Jizhong News) Women in Wenxin and Xinji cities actively participate in agricultural and sideline production. Some villages in Wenxin often suffer from floods, making life difficult for the masses. Most people rely on transportation, sales, fishing, and other sideline occupations to maintain their livelihoods. This year, after the floodwaters receded, in order to make a concentrated effort in the paddy fields, the majority of women participated in farming in response to the government's call. Huang Xiuying and her family of three from Zhangzhuang in the Fifth District cultivated five rice paddies, providing their own seedlings and transplanting them themselves, completing the transplanting of fifteen mu in five days. They also worked together to pull plows, roll the soil, and carry water to loosen the soil, helping the men sow seeds, planting 120 mu of rice in thirteen days. In Chen Huangfu and Yang Song villages in the First District, forty-seven women were organized, with twelve of them pulling plows and compacting the soil just like the men. With their efforts and assistance, the entire village completed the sowing of 617 mu of loosened soil in ten days. In Mengjiawu, in addition to participating in making bamboo mats, nets, and spinning thread in the groups, women also pulled seeders, plows, and provided rice seedlings. Relying on the participation of women, the entire village had completely finished sowing the 17 qing of loosened soil in May.

Previously, women in Xinji City, except for a small number who engaged in needlework due to financial difficulties, mostly did not participate in production. After the land reform, through the advocacy and education of the democratic government, women gradually began to work, participating in various productions such as spinning thread, spinning hemp, rolling cigarettes, and pasting boxes. Older women also inspected wool and cotton in felt workshops and mills. Currently, there are 1,700 people (including some outside the city) spinning thread by hand for the burlap bag factory, and more than thirty women working as net makers and bag sewers. More than 2,140 households (including some villages outside the city) are spinning thread for the Yonghe Towel Factory. In total, the number of women participating in labor in the city accounts for more than 80 percent of the female population. Song Duan, a woman from the First Street, earns a living for three people by spinning thread for the Yongsheng Factory. Li Da Ma from the Eighth Street supports her entire family of five by spinning thread.

　　文新、辛集妇女大部参加耕作
    【冀中讯】文新、辛集市妇女积极参加农副业生产。文新有些村庄经常有水患，群众生活困难。大部要靠运销、捕鱼和其他副业来维持生活。今年水落后，为了突击水田，在政府的号召下，大部妇女都参加了耕作。五区张庄黄秀英等三家伙打了五个稻池，自己出秧自己栽，五天栽完十五亩；并合着拉耠子，挑耩水脱地，帮助男人下种，十三天种稻一百二十亩。一区陈黄甫、杨宋村组织起四十七个妇女，有十二人和男子一样的拉耠子砘地。在她们努力参加帮助下，十天种好全村水脱地六百一十七亩。孟家务的妇女除了参加组里打箔、网、纺线，并一样拉耧，拉耠子、出稻秧子。全村依靠妇女参加，在五月里已全部完成十七顷水脱地的下种。
    辛集市妇女以前除一部分生活困难的做些针工外，大部不参加生产。土改后，经过民主政府的提倡和教育，妇女逐渐劳动起来，参加纺线、纺麻、卷烟、糊盒等各种生产。年纪大的也在毡坊、轧坊检毛检花。现在给麻袋工厂纺手工的就有一千七百人（内有市外一部），打络、缝袋的女工三十多人。给永和毛巾工厂纺线的有二千一百四十多户（包括市外村一部）。总计全市参加劳动的妇女占妇女人口百分之八十以上。一街妇女宋端给永生厂打线，能供养三个人。八街李大马靠打线养活全家五口。
