　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 23rd: TASS, Rome, July 18th: Xie Jie, Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, wrote in Unità that Togliatti's recent speech in parliament raised the banner of peace, freedom, and national independence. Friends and enemies of Italy, both at home and abroad, heard Togliatti's voice. The enemies wanted to stifle this voice. This was not an isolated crime committed by a madman; behind the murderer stood the forces of war instigators and supporters of reactionary dictatorship. This force will never gain the upper hand, as demonstrated by the spontaneous and resolute demonstrations of the Italian working people, not only for the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. Four bullets opened the eyes of many people. Today, millions more Italians realize that their country's peace, freedom, and independence are in danger. The forces of war will never gain the upper hand because the forces of peace around the world outweigh the forces of war instigators, and this is also true in Italy. The general strike marked the beginning of a new great battle, and millions of Italians are filled with the determination to defend peace, freedom, and national independence. The general strike not only proved that Togliatti is the leader of democratic Italy, but also that the Communist Party is the largest party in the country. It is the Party's duty to consolidate and strengthen the Party's ranks. Comrade Stalin's warning concerns us Communists first and foremost, but it also concerns all democrats in Italy. We fully feel our responsibility. The life of Comrade Togliatti, the life of the leader of the People's Democratic Front, cannot be protected solely by security measures; we must also strengthen the struggle against the resurgence of fascism and strengthen the struggle against imperialist war plans.

  　谢杰论意大利局势
  　和平自由独立在危险中新的伟大战斗正在开始
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社罗马十八日讯：意共副总书记谢杰在团结报上撰文称，托格里亚蒂最近在议会的一次演说，高举起和平、自由与民族独立的大旗。意大利国内与国外的朋友和敌人，都听到了托格里亚蒂的声音。敌人想窒息这一声音。这并不是疯人所犯的孤立罪行，站在凶手背后的是战争挑拨者和反动独裁拥护者的势力。这一势力绝不会赢得优势，现在，这不仅为共产党和社会党，而且为意大利劳动人民自发而坚决的力量示威所证明。四粒子弹打开了很多人的眼睛。今天，又有数百万意大利人认识到他们国家的和平、自由和独立在危险中。战争势力绝不会赢得优势，因为全世界的和平力量超过了战争挑拨者的力量，在意大利也是如此。总罢工标志着新的伟大战斗的开始，成百万的意大利人充满了保卫和平、自由与国家独立的决心。总罢工不仅证明了托格里亚蒂是民主意大利的领袖，而且也证明了共产党是全国最大的政党，巩固与坚强党的队伍，这是党的职责。斯大林同志的警告，首先关涉到我们共产党人，但是，它也关涉到意大利的一切民主人士。我们充分感到我们的责任。托格里亚蒂同志的生命，人民民主阵线领袖的生命，不能仅由安全措施来护卫，我们还必须加强反对法西斯死灰复燃的斗争，加强反对帝国主义战争计划的斗争。
