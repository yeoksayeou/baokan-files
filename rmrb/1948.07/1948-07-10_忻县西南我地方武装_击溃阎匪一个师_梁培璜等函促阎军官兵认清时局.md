Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 8th. On June 29th, the entire 39th Division of the Yan Army in Xin County advanced on Yancun (southwest of Xin County) and was decisively defeated by a unit of our local corps. More than 500 enemy soldiers were killed or captured, including enemy regiment commander Zhu Xuefan (killed). The amount of captured materials is still being inventoried.

[This Newspaper Reports] Liang Peihuang, Xu Qichang, and other senior Yan army officers who were liberated, issued a letter to all officers and soldiers of the Jin Sui Army. The full text is as follows: Respected senior officers, old colleagues, old subordinates, and all officers and soldiers of the Jin Sui Army:

We were fortunate to escape disaster during the Linfen and Shouyang campaigns. After liberation, our daily life was sincerely and considerately cared for by the military and political leaders of the People's Liberation Army. After a short rest, we were sent to the PLA Officers' Education Corps to study Chinese issues. After arriving at the corps, we were treated as cadres, focusing on self-study with guidance. We could freely raise questions and discuss them to clarify right and wrong. Our personalities were not insulted in any way, so we were enlightened and felt happy. We are not made of wood or stone, how could we not be grateful? It was a blessing in disguise.

Recalling our past, living in the mountains, we were ignorant and ill-informed. Mr. Yan (referring to Yan Xishan) rose in Jin Sui, initially advocating "governing Jin by the people of Jin", lingering in the era of the Northern Warlords. Later, he used the National Revolution as a banner to amass wealth from the people. Especially around the time of the July 7th Incident, he became arrogant and ignorant, unaware that there was a world outside of Shanxi. Therefore, he closed the door to build his own cart, advocating heresies, attempting to turn back the wheels of history and consolidate his bloody rule. Everything from "material securities" to "distribution according to labor", "advocating fairness", and "integrating soldiers and farmers" was nothing more than using pleasant words to cover up the counter-revolutionary essence of harming the people. Especially around the time of the December coup (i.e., December 1939), he fabricated the so-called slave philosophy of "existence is truth, need is legitimate", confusing the enemy and ourselves, deceiving the world, and even failing to distinguish between loyalty and treachery, killing meritorious people, colluding with Japanese invaders, and attacking the New Fourth Army. This was the epitome of outrageous and shameless behavior.

Not only that, Mr. Yan's butcher knife was not only aimed at the people, but also at us, large and small military and political personnel, exhausting his brains to control us. Such as "Iron Army", "Comrade Association", "Loyalty Guarantee", all kinds of tricks and ugly performances, the intention is nothing more than knowing that his crimes are heinous, fearing that we will despise him, so a pair of bloody hands are pinching our throats. Everyone is in danger. In his eyes, there are no reliable subordinates, and among us, there are no trustworthy colleagues. Such a one-handed, self-disturbing behavior is only intended to make others bow their heads and be an earthen emperor opening a door from the roof.

Although we have not yet seen the full picture of the specific implementation of the CCP's proposals and various policies in the liberated areas shortly after our liberation, the entire region, from the Party, government, military, and down to the people, are united as one. The military and civilians, officers and soldiers are united. The people have land to cultivate, food to eat, clothes to wear, work to do, and books to read. There are no thieves, no beggars, doors are not closed at night, and lost items are not picked up. The world of Yao and Shun has reappeared today! All landlords also receive the same share of land as farmers. Military and political cadres, veterans, and families of soldiers on expeditions are guaranteed their lives by law, without family concerns, without foreign privileges. Industry and commerce are developing upward. It is foreseeable that a poor and backward agricultural China will leap into a strong and wealthy industrialized country in the East.

Today's situation in China is that the liberated areas, from Heilongjiang to the Yangtze River, are connected as one. The Chiang army in the Northeast only has isolated strongholds in Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinzhou. Rehe only has the dead city of Chengde. Hebei and Shandong only maintain a few isolated islands in Pingjin, Jinan, and Qingdao. South of the Yangtze River, people's uprisings are springing up, and people's hearts are changing. Chiang Kai-shek's rule, which has always been proud of unifying China, is disintegrating and morale is low. After the failure of the "consolidate points, connect lines, expand the surface" defensive strategy, he is preparing to "retreat to Liangguang" and relies on Chennault's airlift as the only savior, relying on luck. Mr. Yan, who is about to die and is in a small place, is still reciting Chiang's myth of "military occupation, people's consolidation, army defeat, people's elimination" in Taiyuan shamelessly. His lack of self-knowledge is so great. Now that Linfen has fallen, what will happen to Taiyuan is self-evident to those who know the situation. Thus, it is self-evident to those who know the situation that the people will win and Chiang and Yan will lose.

We have received the cultivation of the people but do not know how to repay their kindness, instead helping Yan to do evil. Our hometown elders have been ravaged. Our towering crimes are countless. After liberation, we deeply realized that the present is right and the past is wrong. Looking back on the past, we feel ashamed. However, our old comrades are still lost and not awake. If we do not plan for them early, once the army approaches the city, there will be no complete eggs under the overturned nest. Every time we think about this, we can't help but feel sad. We offer our lessons and hopes to be able to turn back to good, make a decisive decision, and believe that the People's Liberation Army will certainly adhere to the broad policy and will not blame the past. We can be a lesson for the past, do not wait and see to mislead ourselves. The general trend is so, these words come from the heart. Where to go and what to do, choose wisely. Looking forward to your success!

Liang Peihuang, former Lieutenant General Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth Army Group, Xu Qichang, former Major General Division Commander of the 66th Division, Yi, former Lieutenant General Division Commander of the 49th Division, Liu Guangdou, former Lieutenant General Commander of the Jinan Garrison Area, Xi Anren, former Major General Senior Counselor of the 34th Army, Zhao Junyi, former Major General Deputy Division Commander of the 49th Division, Tang Jiamo, former Major General Deputy Division Commander of the 66th Division, Du Xuandao, former Colonel Chief of Staff of the 66th Division, Meng Changwei, former Colonel Political Director of the 66th Division, Su Fengji, former Colonel Branch Chief of the 37th Branch of the Supply Station, Gao Haifu, former Colonel Deputy Commander of the Linfen Garrison Area, Jia Zhengnai, former Director of the 12th Branch of the National Revolutionary Comrades Association, respectfully.

### 忻县西南我地方武装　击溃阎匪一个师  梁培璜等函促阎军官兵认清时局

　　忻县西南我地方武装
    击溃阎匪一个师
    梁培璜等函促阎军官兵认清时局
    【新华社晋绥八日电】六月二十九日忻县阎军三十九师全部向我晏村（忻县西南）进犯，被我地方兵团某部击溃，毙俘敌团长朱学范（毙）以下五百余名，缴获正清查中。
    【本报讯】被解放的阎军高级军官梁培璜、徐其昌等发出致晋绥军全体官兵书，全文如下：晋绥军老长官、老同僚、老部下与全体官兵钧鉴：
    临汾与寿阳两次战役，我等幸免于难。解放以后，生活起居，均蒙人民解放军军政首长诚恳相待，关怀备至，稍事喘息。即先后送至解放军官教导团，从事研究中国问题。到团以后，生活按干部待遇，以自学为主，加以辅导，对疑难问题，均能自由提出讨论，辨明是非。对我等人格，丝毫未加侮辱，因而茅塞顿开，精神愉快，人非木石，能不感戴？因祸得福，此之谓也。
    回忆我等过去居处山隅，孤陋寡闻，加以阎先生（指阎锡山）崛起晋绥，始则揭药晋人治晋，悠然于北洋之世，继以国民革命为标榜，囊括民脂民膏。而在七七事变前后，尤复夜郎自大，坐井观天，不知山西之外别有天地，因而闭门造车，倡为邪说，企图倒转历史车辆，巩固血腥统治。举凡“物产证券”也，“按劳分配”也，“主张公道”也，“兵农合一”也，无一不是以好听词句，掩盖其残民以误之反革命实质。特别在十二月政变（即一九三九年十二月）前后，捏造所谓“存在就是真理，需要就是合法”的奴隶哲学，敌我不分，玩世欺人，甚至不辨忠奸，残杀有功，勾结日寇，打击新军，此丧天害理，不知人间有羞耻事之尤者也。
    不仅此也，阎先生之屠刀，不但砍在人民头上，而且对我等大小军政人员，亦绞尽脑汁，谋所以控制之道，如“铁军”也，“同志会”也，“忠贞保证”也，五花八门，丑态百出，揆其用心，无非自知罪大恶极，虑为我等所不齿，因而一双血手，捏着我等咽喉。谈虎色变，人人自危。在彼耳目中无一可靠之部属，而在我等相互间亦无一可信之同僚，似此一手遮天，庸人自扰之所为，不过企图别人俯首贴耳，做一个从房顶开门的土皇帝而已。
    我等解放不久，对中共主张与解放区各种政策之具体实施，虽然尚未窥其全貌，但全区党政军上下团结一致，军民、官兵一致、人民有地耕、有饭吃、有衣穿、有工作、有书读，无盗贼、无乞丐，夜不闭户，道不拾遗，唐虞之世，复见于今日矣！所有地主亦分得农民同样一份土地，军政干部、荣誉军人、出征军人家属均有法律保证其生活，无家庭顾虑，无外国人特权，工商业向上发展，行见一个贫困落后的农业中国，将一跃而为东方工业化的强富之国。
    今日中国局势，解放区由黑龙江到杨子江，连成一片。东北蒋军只剩沈、长、锦孤立据点。热河只有一个承德死城。河北、山东不过保持平、津、济、青几个孤岛。长江以南，民变蜂起，人心思变。素以统一中国自负的蒋贼统治尚且分崩离析、士气不振，在“固点、联线、扩面”的防御方针失败以后，又布置所谓“退守两广”的退却准备，而以陈纳德空运为唯一救星，靠天吃饭。行将就木、伏处弹丸的阎先生，还在太原大言不惭的背诵此人“军事占领、民众巩固、军队击溃、民众肃清”的神话，其不自量也如此。目前临汾已失，太原又将如何，不待识者而自知。如此，人民必胜，蒋阎必败亦不待识者而知之矣。
    我等身受人民培养，不知怀德报本，反而助阎为恶，桑梓父老，蹂躏备至，滔天之罪，擢发难数。解放之后，深知今是而昨非，抚今思昔，惶愧莫名。然旧日袍泽，犹在沉迷不醒，倘不早为之图，一旦大军临城，复巢之下，必无完卵，每一念及，不禁惆然，爰本身受教训，略贡区区，望能回心向善，当机立断，相信人民解放军必然一本宽大政策，不咎既往，我等可为前车之鉴，勿再观望以自误。大势所趋，言出肺腑，何去何从，善为择之，临颖神驰，恭候勋祺！
    前第六集团军中将副总司令梁培璜、前第六十六师少将师长徐其昌、前第四十九师中将师长翼、前晋南师管区中将司令刘光斗、前第三十四军少将高级参议席安仁、前第四十九师少将副师长赵俊义、前第六十六师少将副师长汤嘉谟，前第六十六师上校参谋长杜宣道、前第六十六师上校政治主任孟常威，前兵站三十七支部上校支部长苏逢吉、前临汾团管区上校副司令高海富、前民族革命同志会第十二分会主任贾正鼐合叩。
