　　The Annihilation of Yan's Bandit Elite Training Division
　　Bo Zhuang, Jian Guang
　　On June 21st, Yan Xishan's "Elite Training Division" 72nd Division in Xishan, along with the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the "Elite Training" Mountain Artillery Regiment, personally led by Division Commander Chen Zhendong, advanced from Zhujiabao in Jiexiu along the Tongpu Railway towards Caocun in Pingyao. They were constantly on edge, fearing annihilation by the People's Liberation Army. "Each regiment advanced in three columns abreast, with intervals of 200 to 300 meters between columns, and each column had to contact its superior every half hour, stipulating that the left, right, and directly subordinate central columns should all take the north side of the railway as the standard." (Chen Zhendong's diary from the front) Finally, they were as careful as could be.

　　This "Elite Training Division" was a so-called elite division that Yan Xishan had carefully selected from his various subordinate units. Compared to Yan's other troops, it was particularly well-manned and equipped. In addition to being personally trained by Yan Xishan, it had also been trained for a long time by Japanese prisoners of war retained by him. Since its official formation in July of last year, the division had been stationed in Taiyuan without being deployed. Ten days ago, it was dispatched from Taiyuan for the first time, heading to Jiexiu, supposedly to "defend" central Shanxi and "defend" Taiyuan. But as soon as it arrived in Jiexiu, it encountered the People's Liberation Army launching a powerful offensive towards central Shanxi, and quickly recovered Lingshi City, making Chen Zhendong uneasy, and he hurriedly ordered the entire division to retreat towards Pingyao, attempting to escape annihilation by the People's Liberation Army.

　　Things did not go smoothly. As soon as Yan's bandits departed from Dafu Village, they discovered a unit of the People's Liberation Army. Yan's mountain artillery hurriedly opened fire, but the People's Liberation Army ignored them and retreated. Yan's bandits breathed a sigh of relief and continued to move forward, steeling themselves. But not far ahead, an unknown number of People's Liberation Army troops suddenly appeared on the left side of Yan's bandits. Shells rained down on the ranks of Yan's bandits, creating deafening explosions. Yan's bandits fled forward in panic, only to encounter another unit of the People's Liberation Army head-on, blocking their way. Those who turned to flee west were also surrounded and annihilated by the People's Liberation Army, crying out in vain. At this point, Yan's bandits finally awoke as if from a dream, realizing that they had fallen into the dragnet set by the People's Liberation Army.

　　The cannons and machine guns of the People's Liberation Army roared non-stop, and the formation of Yan's bandits had long been disrupted. Some scattered and fled, while others shrank into a ball like foul mud. Before the sound of the bugle call for the charge had faded, the courageous People's Liberation Army had already stormed into the positions of Yan's bandits from all directions. Sun Shiliu, a special-class merit recipient of a certain unit, killed an enemy with a single bayonet thrust. He Guisheng, the squad leader of the Third Squad, who was wounded, even grappled with an enemy, and Zhang Mingkuan, another soldier, seeing this, raised his gun and shot the enemy down. The machine gunner of the First Platoon, holding his machine gun, swept towards the enemy like a whirlwind. More than a dozen enemies fled into a wheat field, but a burst of machine-gun fire brought them all down. Zhu Zuocheng, the squad leader of the Ninth Squad of the Sixth Company of a certain unit, closely followed and rushed into the wheat field. Four enemies rose from the ground and engaged him in bayonet fighting. He had no bayonet, so he raised his gun and shot one enemy dead. While ejecting the cartridge, the second enemy rushed up, and he used the muzzle of his gun to push the enemy down again. The third enemy stabbed him in the arm with a knife. He retreated backward, and with a bang, shot the enemy down again. The fourth enemy had not yet approached when he was shot in the back and fell to the ground, unable to move. The brave soldiers of the Fourth Company of a certain unit charged towards an enemy artillery position, and more than thirty enemy artillerymen were so frightened that they automatically gathered and surrendered their cannons.

　　Under the repeated assaults of the People's Liberation Army, Yan's bandits, like a swarm of bees, were driven by the People's Liberation Army from east to north, and from north to south, on the open ground along the Fen River, less than five li long from Dafu to Caocun; after fighting in the south, they fled to the north again; hiding in the trenches, they were driven out by cannons; scurrying onto the flat ground, they were shot by machine guns and could not raise their heads. In this way, thousands upon thousands of Yan's bandits were captured. A group of Yan's bandits tried to cross the Fen River to escape, but as soon as they reached the riverbank or the center of the river, they were all annihilated. In just three hours, this Yan's "Elite Training Division" and "Elite Training Mountain Artillery Regiment," having engaged the People's Liberation Army for the first time, were completely annihilated.

　　In July of last year, Yan Xishan said at the founding ceremony of the "Elite Training Division": "The Elite Training Division must coexist and succeed with me. Where there is the Elite Training Division, there is me; where there is the Elite Training Division, there is Taiyuan." Now that this "Elite Training Division" has reached its final resting place, one wonders if Yan Xishan will "co-exist" and "achieve benevolence" with it?!

　　阎匪亲训师的覆灭
    伯庄　剑光
    六月二十一日，阎匪锡山的“亲训师”七十二师全部，附“亲训”山炮团第一、第三营，由师长陈震东亲自率领，从介休朱家堡沿着同蒲路经大甫向平遥的曹村前进。一路上提心吊胆，恐怕被解放军歼灭。“各团以三个纵队齐头并进，纵队间隔二百米至三百米，每半小时得与上级连系一次，并规定左右及直属中央纵队，皆以铁路北为准。”（陈匪震东的阵中日记）终算小心透顶了。
    这个“亲训师”，是阎锡山从他所属各个部队里七挑八选组成的所谓精锐师，比起阎匪的其他部队，人员特别充足，装备也特别优良。除了经过阎匪亲自训练外，还经过他留用的日本战俘长期训练。该师从去年七月正式组成以来，一直放在太原没有动用过。十天前，它才从太原初次出师，开到介休，据说是为了“保卫”晋中，“保卫”太原。但是刚到介休，就碰上解放军向晋中发动强大攻势，一举收复灵石城，弄得陈匪震东坐卧不安，急忙又令全师向平遥回窜，企图逃脱被解放军歼灭的厄运。
    事情并不很顺利，阎匪刚从大甫村出发，就发现一部解放军。阎匪的山炮慌忙开炮轰击，但解放军毫不理睬的掉头后撤。阎匪透了一口气，硬着头皮继续前进。但走不多远，不知多少的解放军，又突然出现在阎匪的左侧。炮弹猛烈的打向阎匪的行列，发出震天的爆炸声。阎匪仓惶前窜，又碰到另一部解放军迎头痛击，挡住去路。掉头西逃的，亦遭解放军包围聚歼，叫天不应。这时阎匪才如梦初醒，知道自己已经钻入解放军布下的天罗地网里了。
    解放军的大炮、机枪在不停地怒吼，阎匪的队形早已乱了。一部分四散逃窜，一部分象臭泥似的缩成一团。冲锋号的尾声未落，勇猛的解放军已从四面八方突入阎匪的阵地。某部特等功臣孙世流，一刺刀就解决了一个敌人。负了伤的三班长贺贵生，还扭住一个敌人摔跤，另一战士张明宽见状，端起枪，一枪就把那个敌人撩倒。一排的机枪手，端着机枪狂风似的向敌人扫射。有十几个敌人逃进一块麦地里，一梭子机枪打过去，敌人全部倒下了。某部六连九班长朱作成紧跟着冲进麦地，四个敌人从地上爬起和他拼刺刀，他没有刺刀，端起枪打死一个。在推子弹的当儿，第二个敌人冲上来，他用枪口又把敌顶倒。第三个敌人一刀刺在他的臂上，他向后一退，砰的一枪，又把敌打倒。第四个敌人未得接近，即被背后一枪，打倒在地，不能动弹了。某部四连的勇士们，向敌人一个山炮阵地冲过去，三十多个敌炮兵吓得自动集合起来缴炮投降了。
    在解放军反复冲杀下，阎匪象一窝蜂样的在大甫到曹村不满五里长的汾河畔开阔地上，被解放军从东赶到北，北又赶向南；南边打一阵，又逃到北边来；躲到壕沟里，又被大炮撵出来；窜到平地上，又遭机枪打得抬不起头来。就是这样，阎匪成千成百的被俘了。一股阎匪想越过汾河逃命，但刚到河边或河中心亦被全部消灭。只经过三小时，这个阎日的“亲训师”和“亲训山炮团”，才和解放军初次交手，就被全部歼灭了。
    去年七月，阎锡山曾在“亲训师”成立典礼大会上说：“亲训师要与我共存亡共成功，有亲训师就有我，有亲训师就有太原。”现在，这个“亲训师”已告寿终正寝，不知阎锡山要否“共亡”“成仁”？！（晋中前线十三日电）
