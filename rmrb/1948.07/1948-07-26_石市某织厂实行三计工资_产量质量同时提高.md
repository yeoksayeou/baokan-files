Shijiazhuang News: A certain weaving factory is tentatively implementing a three-calculation wage system, resulting in a doubling of output compared to when production started, with a significant improvement in quality. Based on surveys and experimental calculations, and according to specific circumstances, the factory stipulated a three-calculation wage system (i.e., calculation by yardage, quality, and work attitude). After discussion by workers in each group of the trade union and approval by the factory leadership, it was implemented on May 1st. The specific measures are as follows: (1) Machine weavers have a fixed basic monthly wage. Each person oversees one loom, receiving the equivalent of 60 to 80 jin of millet; overseeing two looms earns 70 to 100 jin of millet. At the end of the month, the specific amount of the basic wage is determined based on the individual's production quantity, quality, and work attitude (such as protecting public property), after evaluation by the group and approval by the factory. (2) In addition to the basic wage, weavers overseeing one loom receive 1.7 liang of rice per yard of cloth woven, and those overseeing two looms receive 1.4 liang of rice per yard of cloth woven. (3) At the beginning of each month, looms are reassigned once according to the individual's production performance in the previous month. Workers overseeing two looms with the worst performance are reassigned to oversee one loom, while workers overseeing one loom with the best performance are reassigned to oversee two or even three looms. (4) Machine weavers, finishing workers, and general workers inside and outside the workshop are evaluated and rated within a certain period, based on their production performance and work attitude, within the established maximum wage limit. Since the implementation of this method, the previous problem of weavers only focusing on quantity and neglecting quality under the piece-rate wage system has been overcome. Not only has the quality improved, but the output has also increased. At the end of May, statistics showed that the highest daily output per loom had reached 48 yards (each bolt of cotton cloth being 40 yards). By the end of June, the output per loom had doubled compared to when production started.

　　石市某织厂实行三计工资
  　产量质量同时提高
    【石家庄讯】某织布厂，暂行三计工资，产量较开工时增加一倍，质量也有显著提高，该厂根据调查和实验计算，按照具体情况，规定三计工资（即计码、计质量、计劳动态度），经职工分会各小组工人讨论及厂部批准，于五月一日开始实行，具体办法为：（一）机织工每月有固定的基本工资，每人看一台布机，六十斤至八十斤小米，看二台布机七十斤至一百斤小米。以上基本工资数于月终时，根据本人本月生产数量、质量及劳动态度（如爱护公物等），经小组评议，厂部审核批准发给。（二）除基本工资外，看一台布机的每织一码布得米一两七钱，看二台布机的每织一码布，得米一两四钱。（三）每月初按照上月个人生产成绩好坏调机一次。看二台布机的工人成绩最差的调看一台布机，看一台布机成绩最好的调看二台或至三台布机。（四）机织工、整理工以及车间内外的杂工，在既定的最高额工资内，根据本人生产成绩及劳动态度，在一定期内评定。这一办法实行以来，克服了过去按件工资制时织布工人只顾数量不顾质量的毛病，不但提高了质量，也同时提高了产量。五月终统计每日每台布机产量最高的已达到四十八码（每匹棉布为四十码），六月终每台布机产量已比开工时增加一倍。
