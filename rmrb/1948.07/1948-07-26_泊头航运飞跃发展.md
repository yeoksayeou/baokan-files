(JiZhong Electricity) BoTou shipping has developed rapidly. From March to July, the number of ships has increased from 9 to 186. In March of this year, the BoTou Public Security Bureau's Water Police Station, in conjunction with the BoTou City Shipping Industry Union, held a forum for more than a dozen shipowners docked in the city, explaining in detail our party's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, and explained that the shipping industry is regarded the same as industry and commerce. This news quickly spread, and shipowners from all over came to the city to engage in the shipping business, which was very profitable. Zhu DeCai loaded goods three times and earned a net profit of more than two million yuan. Chang BaoYin and Wu JinShan both received government loan assistance to solve their difficulties in life and business.

　　泊头航运飞跃发展
    【冀中电】泊头航运飞跃发展，从三月至七月，已由大小船九只发展到一百八十六只。今年三月间，泊头公安局水上派出所结合泊头市船业工会，召开了停泊该市的十几户船户座谈会，详细讲明了我党保护与发展工商业的政策；说明航运输业与工商业同样看待。这些消息很快的传播出去，各地船户纷纷来该市经营航业，非常赚钱。朱德才连装了三次货，赚纯利达二百多万元；常保印、吴金山都得到政府贷款帮助，解决了生活和经营上的困难。
