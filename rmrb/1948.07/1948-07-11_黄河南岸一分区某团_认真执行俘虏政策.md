(Dispatch from JiluYu on the 7th) A certain regiment of the First Sub-district on the south bank of the Yellow River seriously implemented the policy on prisoners of war during the offensive against the Jinpu Railway at the beginning of last month, in coordination with the main force. After each battle, political workers immediately conducted investigations and comforted the prisoners of war, tracking down anything they had lost. Political Commissar Gao Lin often personally talked with the prisoners of war to examine the implementation of the policy. For the wounded soldiers, he instructed the medical staff to apply medicine carefully. He especially told the troops guarding the prisoners of war to be kind in their attitude and to provide good food and drink. Due to the importance attached by the leadership, everyone automatically implemented the policy. The machine gun and artillery company took care of the prisoners of war, providing the same food, drink, and sleeping arrangements as their own, and actively promoted and explained the Party's policy and the current situation to the prisoners of war. Zhao Lian (currently a military instructor), who was liberated from Yangshanji, educated the prisoners of war with his own experience of the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army, which had a great impact. Warrior Wen Gan of the Seventh Company took two Gold Star pens from a wounded enemy squad leader at Liulizhuang. Realizing that this violated the policy, he put the pens back into the squad leader's pocket. Among the ninety-two prisoners of war reviewed by the regimental political office, none were subjected to insults, and nine wounded prisoners were well cared for.

　　黄河南岸一分区某团
    认真执行俘虏政策
    【冀鲁豫七日电】黄河南岸一分区某团，上月初旬，配合主力向津浦线出击战中，认真执行俘虏政策。每次战斗后，政工人员立即调查。慰问俘虏，丢了东西的马上追查。政委高林常亲自和俘虏谈话，考查政策执行情形。对伤兵，则嘱咐卫生员好好上药。对看管俘虏部队，特别告诉他们态度要和气，搞好吃喝。由于领导上的重视，大家都自动执行政策。机炮连照顾俘虏，吃、喝、睡全和自己一样，还积极向俘虏宣传解释党的政策和目前形势。羊山集解放过来的赵链（现任军事教员），并以对解放军宽大政策的亲身体验教育俘虏，影响很大。七连战士文干，在六里庄拿了敌负伤班长两支金星笔，他想到这是违犯政策的，于是又将笔插进该班长的口袋里。在团政所审查过的九十二个俘虏中，无一受到侮辱。并有九个伤俘被很好救护。
