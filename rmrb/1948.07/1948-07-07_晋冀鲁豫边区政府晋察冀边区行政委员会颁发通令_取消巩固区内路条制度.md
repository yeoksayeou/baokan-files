　　The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee Issue Circular
    Abolishing the Road Pass System in Consolidated Areas
    [Our Newspaper] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee issued a circular on June 24th, abolishing the road pass system in consolidated areas. The original text is as follows: Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to prevent enemy agents and spies from infiltrating the Liberated Areas to carry out sabotage, a road pass system has been implemented for travelers. This played a significant role in ensuring the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and protecting the safety of the people at that time. Now, the armed enemies in the hinterland of our North China Liberated Areas have been basically eliminated, and the war has been directed towards the border areas or enemy-occupied areas. The vast hinterland has been completely connected into one piece. Continuing this road pass system is no longer necessary, but instead restricts people's travel and commercial activities, hindering economic development. For this reason, it is hereby ordered that the road pass system be abolished in all consolidated areas, and that merchants and people are free to move to and fro. No troops, organizations, or groups may obstruct them unless according to law. However, border areas should still pay close attention to preventing the activities of enemy agents and spies. Those leaving the Liberated Areas to go to enemy-occupied areas and those coming to the Liberated Areas from enemy-occupied areas must still be inspected according to law and complete entry and exit registration procedures and obtain entry and exit permits. All those who have already obtained exit or entry permits are allowed to freely exit or enter the country without further restrictions. Except for the Measures for the Administration of Entry and Exit of Civilians and Merchants, which shall be handled in accordance with the current system for the time being, and unified measures will be announced separately thereafter, this is hereby ordered to be followed uniformly throughout the region.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会颁发通令
    取消巩固区内路条制度
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府暨晋察冀边区行政委员会于六月二十四日颁发通令，取消巩固区内路条制度，原文如下：抗战以来，为防止敌探奸细混入解放区进行破坏，曾对来往行人实行路条制度。这对当时保障抗日战争胜利和保障人民安全，都起了很大的作用。现在我华北解放区内地的武装敌人都已基本肃清，战争已引向边缘地区或敌占区，广大内地已完全联成一片，再继续这种路条制度已无必要，反使人民来往及商旅活动受到限制，妨碍经济发展。为此特通令在一切巩固区内取消路条制度，商旅人民迁徙往来，一律自由，任何部队、机关、团体非依法律，不得阻碍。但边缘地区仍应严密注意防止敌探奸细的活动。自解放区出境到敌占区及从敌占区来解放区者仍须依法受检查，并履行出入境登记手续，领取出入境证。凡一切已领有出境或入境证件者，均允许其自由出境或入境，不再加以限制。除民商出入境管理办法暂依现行制度办理，随后并即另行公布统一办法外，特通令全区一律遵行。
