　　Jinnan Administrative Office Issues Notice
    Protect Public Property and Collect Industrial Equipment
    [Jinnan News] The Jinnan Administrative Office issued a notice to the governments of all counties and districts under its jurisdiction, stating "Collect industrial equipment from various places and take extra care to protect public land and public houses." The notice stated: (1) In order to collect industrial equipment scattered in various places and strengthen industrial construction, the following measures are specifically stipulated: 1. All enemy and puppet industrial equipment, hardware materials, electrical materials, small machines, machine parts, various measuring, surveying and chemical instruments, industrial books, etc., confiscated and preserved by governments at all levels since the counter-offensive, shall be inventoried and handed over to the public. 2. All unused industrial equipment stored in production units of various departments should be fully inventoried and handed over to the public, and must not be sold or destroyed in secret. 3. Industrial equipment privately owned by the masses may be donated to the public or purchased by the public at a price. Those who use it themselves and do not want to sell it may do so. (2) Because public housing in various places has been unattended, it has been discovered that the masses have demolished, damaged, stolen wood, bricks, and tiles, or collapsed on their own. Some cadres, on the other hand, emphasize the poverty of the masses and stand by and watch their stealing. In order to protect public property and public houses, the governments of various places in our region should instruct special personnel to take extra care to protect public property and public houses, so as to avoid further damage. From now on, we must oppose the charitable view of ignoring the theft of public property by poor people and the phenomenon of condoning it. It must be understood that it is right for us to solve the difficulties of the poor masses in a timely and proper manner, while stealing and destroying public property is a crime. (3) The excavation of public land, public property, and ruins of public houses in various counties is prohibited, in order to facilitate the construction of public undertakings or organs in the future.

　　冀南行署发出通知
    保护公产公物搜集工业器材
    【冀南讯】冀南行署向所属各县市区政府发出通知，“搜集各地工业器材及加意保护公地公房”，内称：（一）为搜集散在各地的工业器材，加强工业建设，特规定如下办法：一、各级政府自反攻后没收保存之敌伪工业器材、五金材料、电料、小型机器、机器零件、各种测量绘图及化学仪器、工业书籍等一律造具清册交公解上。二、各单位之机关生产所存工业器材凡未用者，应全部造具清册交公解上，不得暗中卖掉及破坏。三、群众手中私有之工业器材或献给公家或由公家出价收买，如自用不愿出卖者听便。（二）各地公房因无人过问，发现有被群众拆掉、破坏、偷窃木材砖瓦，或自行倒毁等现象。而某些干部则强调群众贫苦，对其偷盗袖手旁观。为使保护公产公房，我区各地政府应责成专人对公产公房加意保护，以免再行损坏。今后要反对对于贫苦群众偷盗公物不管的恩赐观点和纵容现象。要了解我们及时的正当的解决贫苦群众的困难是对的，偷盗破坏公物则是犯罪。（三）各县公地公产及公共房屋遗址禁止挖掘，以利将来建筑公共事业或机关之用。
