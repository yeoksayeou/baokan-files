Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: Education in the areas of Dongtai, Rugao, Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong in the Suzhong region is developing rapidly. To meet the cultural demands of the emancipated peasants, the democratic governments of Rugao-Dong and Haimen-Qidong counties, in addition to gathering and training 451 original primary school teachers and assigning them back to their hometowns to teach, also established short-term teacher training classes in counties and districts to train rural intellectuals to serve the village primary schools. In Haimen-Qidong alone, five districts trained 120 primary school teachers. Currently, Haimen-Qidong county has 336 primary schools, 409 primary school teachers, and 23,590 students. Tongru County (a newly established county, composed of parts of Rudong and Nantong) had only 20 primary schools with 900 students before the Liberation War. Now, it has developed to 107 primary schools with 3,897 students. Adult education is also developing rapidly in various places. Each district in Haimen-Qidong county has organized a mass education work team. The county now has 337 adult literacy classes with 3,352 students. In Dongtai County, 14,829 children are enrolled in school. The county has 409 privately-run primary schools, a sharp increase of about seven times compared to the 53 schools last year. This year, the spring famine in the area is severe, and the education leading organs, in response to this special situation, advocate combining teaching with production to overcome the famine. All schools organize children to dig wild garlic and vegetables, and teachers personally lead them to carry salt to exchange for food. When teachers and students are engaged in decentralized labor, they still use "labor literacy cards" and other methods for teaching. Students paste new characters on baskets or sickle handles and learn during labor intervals. The county is now striving to achieve "every village has a school, and everyone receives education." In addition, the counties are also training middle school teachers in preparation for increasing the number of secondary schools.

　　培养师资增设学校苏中教育事业发展
    【新华社华东十三日电】苏中东台、如皋、南通、海门、启东地区教育事业迅速发展。如（皋）东、海（门）启（东）两县民主政府为适应翻身农民文化要求，除集训原有小学教师四百五十一人分派回乡教学外，另在县区开办短期师资训练班，训练农村知识分子，为乡村小学服务，仅海启五个区即培养了小学教师一百二十人。现海启全县已有小学三百三十六所，小学教师四百零九人，学生达二万三千五百九十人。通如县（新设县，如东、南通各一部）在解放战争以前只有二十所小学，九百个学生，现在已发展到一百零七所小学，三千八百九十七名学生。各地成人教育也发展很快。海启县各区都组织有民教工作队，现该县已有成人识字班三百三十七个，学员三千三百五十二名。东台县有一万四千八百二十九个儿童入学。全县有民办小学四百零九所，比去年的五十三所激增约七倍。今年该地春荒严重，教育领导机关针对着这种特殊情况，提倡教学与生产渡荒结合。各校都组织儿童挖小蒜、野菜，教师并亲自带领挑盐换粮。师生在分散劳动时，仍用“劳动识字牌”等方式进行教学。学生把生字贴在篮子或镰刀柄上，利用劳动间隙学习。现该县正为达到“村村有学校，人人受教育”而努力。此外，各县并在培养中学教师，准备增设中等学校。
