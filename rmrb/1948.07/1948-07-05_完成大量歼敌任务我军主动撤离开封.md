　　Our Army Actively Withdraws from Kaifeng After Completing a Large Number of Enemy Elimination Missions

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, June 27th dispatch】(Delayed) The People's Liberation Army actively withdrew from Kaifeng on June 26th. Before withdrawing from Kaifeng, the Political Department of the PLA Front Headquarters issued a proclamation to people from all walks of life in Kaifeng, thanking the people of Kaifeng for their enthusiastic support of the PLA's operations and for cooperating with the PLA in restoring order in the city, expressing condolences to the compatriots who were victimized by enemy bombing and looting, and explaining that the final victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war is not far away. This withdrawal is for the purpose of facilitating the search for opportunities to annihilate the enemy on a larger scale, so as to finally liberate Kaifeng.

　　Note: One of the military principles of the People's Liberation Army proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China in his report last December is to take the annihilation of the enemy's effective strength as the main goal of operations. Conserving or capturing cities is the result of annihilating the enemy's effective strength, and it often takes repeated attempts to finally conserve or capture them. In the past, the PLA quickly and actively withdrew from major cities such as Luoyang and Yuncheng after the first liberation, and soon occupied them again.

　　完成大量歼敌任务我军主动撤离开封
    【新华社开封前线六月二十七日电】（迟到）人民解放军于六月二十六日主动撤离开封。解放军前线司令部政治部于撤离开封前曾发布告开封各界人士的文告，感谢热烈支援解放军作战及协同解放军恢复市内秩序的开封人民，慰问在敌人轰炸、焚掠下被难的同胞，并说明中国人民革命战争最后胜利已为期不远，此次撤离，是为了便于寻找战机，更大量地歼灭敌人，以便最后解放开封。
    按：中共毛泽东主席在去年十二月报告中所提出的人民解放军军事原则之一，即为以歼灭敌有生力量为作战主要目标，保守或夺取城市，是歼灭敌人有生力量的结果，往往须要反复多次才能最后的保守或夺取之。解放军过去对于洛阳、运城等大城市，均曾于第一次解放后迅即主动撤离，而不久即再度占领。
