Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd—The counties of Dongtai and Taipei (newly established county in northern Dongtai) in Subei have overcome the severe spring famine through three months of active production and self-salvation. These two counties suffered severe losses due to the Kuomintang army's brutal "mopping-up" operations, coupled with a poor harvest last autumn, resulting in a widespread and severe spring famine this year. According to March statistics, 200,000 people were short of food, 30 percent of whom were completely out of food and largely subsisted on wild vegetables and shallots, making spring plowing even more difficult. In addition to calling on the masses to work hard in production and self-salvation, the local democratic government issued loans totaling 427.7 million Hua Zhong currency units to help the masses with spring plowing and develop sideline production. It also issued fishery loans of more than 53 million yuan to solve the difficulties of fishermen. Due to the increased enthusiasm of the masses for production, Dongtai County immediately eliminated 18,500 mu of wasteland, built 24 new salt fields, and restored 64 oil mills. Taipei County widely developed the textile industry. In the cotton reclamation areas of Kennan, Kenbei, and Dazhong, the masses in various townships restored more than 6,000 spinning wheels and more than 1,500 looms. Within 40 days, they spun more than 60,000 catties of cotton yarn and wove more than 17,000 bolts of cloth, which were exchanged for more than 5,200 dan of grain (100 catties per dan by market weight), solving the livelihood of more than 30,000 people. With the help of loans, the masses in the salt reclamation area also repaired 70 salt stoves, producing more than 2,600 dan of salt in more than 20 days, earning 700 dan of grain. All districts also widely carried out mass mutual assistance; government agencies and troops also tightened their belts to relieve the disaster. Taipei alone transferred more than 1,600 dan of grain, solving the food problem for more than 20,000 disaster victims who were out of food. In addition, various localities also sorted out floating wealth and distributed it to disaster victims for production. The two counties sorted out a total of more than 2,200 dan of grain, more than 33.3 million Hua Zhong currency units, more than 18,000 catties of raw cotton, and 17 catties of silver. The government also provided work relief, organizing more than 10,000 people to participate in transportation, and distributing 260,000 catties of wages in grain. Through the above efforts, the lives of the disaster victims were maintained. At present, the wheat is being harvested, and the spring famine this year has basically been overcome.

　　苏中东台、台北灾民
    生产自救渡过春荒
    【新华社华东二日电】苏中东台、台北（东台北部新设县）两县经三个月积极生产自救，已克服严重春荒。该两县因连遭蒋军残酷“扫荡”，群众损失惨重，加之去秋歉收，故今年春荒普遍严重。据三月份统计，缺粮者达二十万人，其中断炊者占百分之三十，大部靠野菜、小蒜度日，春耕更为困难。当地民主政府除号召群众努力生产自救外，并发放贷款华中币四亿二千七百七十万元帮助群众春耕及发展副业生产；又发放渔贷五千三百余万元，解决渔民困难。由于群众生产热情提高，东台县当即消灭了荒田一万八千五百余亩，新建盐场二十四块，恢复油坊六十四家。台北县则普遍开展纺织业。垦南、垦北、大中等棉垦区各乡群众恢复了纺车六千余架，织布机一千五百余架，四十天内共纺棉纱六万余斤，织布一万七千余匹，换回粮食五千二百余担（每担市秤百斤），解决了三万余人的生活。盐垦区群众亦在贷款帮助下修好盐灶七十付，廿余天内烧盐二千六百余担，赚粮七百担。各区并广泛开展群众性的互助；机关、部队亦节衣缩食救灾。仅台北即调剂出粮食一千六百余担，解决了两万余断炊灾民的口粮。此外各地又整理浮财，分配灾民生产，两县共整理出粮食二千二百余担，华中币三千三百余万元，皮花一万八千余斤，白银十七斤。政府又以工代赈，组织万余群众参加运输，发下工资粮二十六万斤。经上述各方面的努力，灾民生活得以维持。目前麦子登场，今年春荒基本上已经渡过。
