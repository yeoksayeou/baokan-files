　　Tang County's Production Promotion Cooperative
　　　　　I
　　The Tang County Production Promotion Cooperative was established by merging the former County United Cooperative and the Industry and Commerce Section. It consists of the Production Guidance Department, the Credit Department, and the Business Department, with a total of thirty-two cadres. In addition to general cadres, the Production Guidance Department has also established some specialized cadres, including a well-digging and waterwheel installation team, two cadres specifically in charge of滩地 [滩地 are flat areas of land alongside a river, typically sandy or muddy and often used for farming] (i.e., the director and a member of the Tang River 滩地 Management Committee), a livestock team (specifically in charge of livestock breeding in the mountainous areas of the First, Second, and Third Districts), and a team leading textile production. There are plans to establish a forestry team as well. If the Diligent Service Cooperative and the Superior Resistance Cooperative develop, more specialized cadres will be added. In the future, these specialized cadres must be combined with mass production organizations such as the 滩地 Representatives' Meeting, the Textile Representatives' Meeting, and active afforestation members, and devote themselves specifically to these production endeavors.
　　Branch cooperatives are established entirely based on the production needs of the masses. In order to solve the livelihood problems of disaster victims in the First and Second Districts, a branch cooperative was established in these districts. Its task is to combine grain loans with production to solve the livelihood difficulties of the disaster victims—currently, this mainly involves lending cloth to the masses for running and selling, establishing shoe factories, and organizing women to make shoes. In order to develop the textile industry in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Districts, a branch cooperative specializing in textile business was established there. The branch cooperatives are not established evenly across districts, nor do they operate behind closed doors without regard for the production of the masses, as some cooperatives did in the past. They are established entirely to develop specific production undertakings and solve the production demands of the masses.
　　　　II
　　Currently, the Tang County Production Promotion Cooperative and its branch cooperatives are engaged in the following businesses: First, directly organizing grain and loan provisions. At present, the Promotion Cooperative has directly organized loans of 9,627 catties of agricultural grain, and 1,277,000 yuan (边币 [border region currency], mainly used for well-digging, buying livestock, and buying small carts), to 54 poor peasant households and 23 middle peasant households in nine villages. Textile loans of 10,394 catties of grain and 14 catties of thread have been provided to 97 poor peasant households and 18 middle peasant households in seven villages. Marketing and sales loans of 427 catties of grain, 2,400,000 yuan, and 1,840 bolts of cloth have been provided to 155 poor peasant households in sixteen villages. Industrial workshop loans of 666 catties of grain and 30,000,000 yuan (for making small carts, weaving machines, and hatching chicks) have been provided to a total of 310 poor peasant households and 41 middle peasant households.
　　Grain and loans are provided to the masses as conveniently as possible, giving rice to those who want it and money to those who prefer it. The cloth lent to the disaster areas in the First and Second Districts for marketing was purchased by the Promotion Cooperative with rice. According to their experience, it is best to lend the masses the supplies they need. The Promotion Cooperative collected thread in the Fourth District to lend to weaving households, and commissioned the wood factory of the United Cooperative in the Sixth District to make fifty small carts to lend to households in need, ensuring that the borrowers used the grain and money for the intended purposes. Second, in agriculture, the main task of the Promotion Cooperative is to help the masses dig wells, install waterwheels, buy livestock, buy farm implements, and regulate seeds through grain loans. Seeds have already been regulated, and two teams have been dispatched to install waterwheels. Third, in sideline occupations, the Promotion Cooperative plans to turn the First and Second Districts into general shoe-making and marketing areas. It has already lent out 1,840 bolts of cloth and is currently working to establish shoe factories in the First and Second Districts. Adding to the two existing factories in the Second District, this could solve the livelihood problems of six to eight hundred people.
　　　　III
　　To accomplish the above tasks, the Production Promotion Cooperative needs to set up a large number of specialized cadres. It has already exceeded its staffing quota by thirteen people, and may exceed it by twenty or thirty people in the future. How will their living expenses be resolved? The County Promotion Cooperative purchases native cloth in Tang County City and the Nan Diantou market, which not only develops the textile industry but also generates legitimate handling fees from its operations, with an annual net profit of over 60 million yuan. Solving the expenses of twenty to thirty cadres should not be a problem. (Editor's note: Is such a large organization necessary? It is worth considering.)
　　　　IV
　　The old County Cooperative was taken over by the Promotion Cooperative. The United Village Cooperatives in each district (except the Seventh District, which did not have one) used to operate supply and marketing, weaving factories, shoe factories, pharmacies, wood factories, and flower rooms. Some did quite well. The Promotion Cooperative did not uniformly withdraw shares, cancel, or take over these organizations. Instead, it preserved and supported those that were beneficial to the masses and eliminated those that were not. After research, it was decided to abolish all weaving factories (one in each of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Districts) and lend or sell the machines to the masses because it is more beneficial to treat weaving as a sideline occupation in rural areas. Running factories is prone to losses, and many have collapsed. The supply and marketing business was also generally terminated. In the past, when the enemy blockaded the area, it was beneficial for mountain areas to set up offices to purchase necessities from enemy-occupied areas and supply them to the village cooperatives. Now that transportation in the liberated areas is convenient, village cooperatives can freely go to the market to buy, so the supply and marketing function of the United Village Cooperatives is no longer necessary. Shoe factories, pharmacies, wood factories, and flower rooms are all preserved and developed, with the focus on improving management methods and overcoming bureaucratization. (Editor's note: Overcoming bureaucratization and improving management methods are both very necessary, but to achieve this, many incorrect views must be overcome, such as the relief viewpoint, egalitarianism, dispersing machines, and using people mainly based not on production needs but on abstract political qualifications and poor peasant composition, etc.) This will allow them to provide more benefits to the masses. After the United Village Cooperatives are closed, the funds will be used to solicit the opinions of the masses to decide whether to return them or use them for other production businesses that are beneficial to the masses.

### 唐县的生产推进社

　　唐县的生产推进社
  　　　　　一
    唐县生产推进社是由原县联社与实业科合并成立的，下设生产指导部、信用部及业务部，共有干部三十二人。生产指导部除一般干部外，又设立了一些专业干部，有一个打井按水车小组，两个专管滩地的干部（即唐河滩地管理委员会的主任及委员），一个畜牧小组（专管一、二、三区山地繁殖牲畜事业），一个领导纺织的小组，还计划再设一个造林组。如果勤务社、优抗社发展起来，再增专门干部。这些专业干部，以后得与群众性的生产组织如滩地代表会、纺织代表会、造林积极分子等相结合，专门致力于这些生产事业。
    分社是完全根据群众生产的需要建立起来的。为了解决一、二区灾民的生活问题，他们在一、二区建立了一个分社，它的任务是结合贷粮，通过生产，解决灾民的生活困难，——目前主要是贷给群众布匹跑运销，与建立鞋厂，组织妇女做鞋。为了发展四、五、六、七区的纺织事业，在那里设立了一个专门经营纺织业务的分社。分社不是按区平均设立，也不象过去有些合作社关门经营而不问群众生产，它是完全为了发展一定的生产事业，解决群众生产上的要求建立的。
    　　　　二
    目前唐县生产推进社及其分社所经营的业务有以下几种：第一、直接举办贷粮贷款。目前经推进社直接组织出贷的，计有农业贷粮九六二七斤，贷款边币一、二七七、○○○元（主要用于打井、买牲口、买小车），贷给九个村的贫农五四户，中农二三户。纺织贷粮一○三九四斤，线子十四斤，贷给七个村贫农九十七户，中农十八户。运销贷粮四二七斤，款二、四○○、○○○元，布一八四○匹，贷给十六村贫农一五五户。工业作坊贷粮六六六斤，款三○、○○○、○○○元（作小车，织布机与孵小鸡），共贷给贫农三一○户，中农四一户。
    贷粮贷款尽量给群众以便利，愿要米者给米，愿要款者给款。一、二区贷给灾区运销的布匹，是推进社了米买来的。根据他们的经验，以贷群众所需要的实物为最好。推进社在四区收了线贷给织布户，在六区联合社木工厂定作五十辆小车，贷给需车户，保证了借贷户把所贷粮款用于正途。第二、在农业上，推进社主要的任务是通过贷粮，帮助群众打井、置水车、买牲口、买农具、调剂种子。目前已调剂了种子，并派了两个组去做水车。第三、在副业上，推进社拟把一、二区变成普遍的做鞋区和运销区。现已贷出一八四○匹布，正着手在一、二区再建立鞋厂，加上二区原有的二个，可解决六百至八百人的生活问题。
    　　　　三
    为完成以上的任务，生产推进社要设大量专业干部，现已超过编制十三个人，将来再发展可能超过二、三十人，他们的生活如何解决？县推进社在唐县城内与南店头集上收买土布，既发展了纺织事业，又从经营中取得一部正当的手续费，每年约收入纯利六千余万元，解决二十至三十个干部的开支是不会成问题的。（编者按：机构是否需要如此庞大？值得考虑。）
    　　　　四
    旧县社由推进社接收了。各区的联村社（只七区没有）过去经营供销、织布工厂、鞋厂、药社、木工厂、花房等业务，有的作得不错。推进社对于他们不是一律退股取消或接收，而是保存并扶植对群众有利的，取消对群众没有好处的。经研究结果，把织布工厂（一、二、三、四区各一个）一律取消，机子贷卖给群众，因为在农村中，把织布作为副业比较更有利，搞成工厂容易赔钱，很多都垮了台。供销业务一般也结束了，过去敌人封锁，山区办处到敌区统一采买必需品供给村社，对群众是有利的；现解放区交通便利，各村社可自由到市场去买，联村社供销即不必要了。鞋厂、药社、木工厂、花房，全部保存并加以发展，中心是改进经营方式，克服机关化，（编者按：克服机关化和改善经营方式两点，十分必要，但要做到此点，就必须克服许多不正确的观点，如救济观点、平均主义、分散机器、用人主要不是按照生产需要而是按照抽象的政治资格、贫雇成份等。）使能对群众有更多好处。联村社结束后，其资金征求群众意见，决定退回或用于其他对群众有利的生产业务。
