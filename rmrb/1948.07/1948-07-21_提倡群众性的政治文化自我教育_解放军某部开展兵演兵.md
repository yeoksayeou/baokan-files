Huabei Frontline, 17th Telegraph: A unit of the People's Liberation Army in North China is currently conducting a widespread "Soldier Acting as Soldier" movement. Under the planned organization of the leadership, soldiers themselves are arranging and performing, to achieve self-education, self-improvement. This has become one of the working methods of the mass line in military and political work, creating a new direction for mass literary and artistic activities in the troops.

Around the time of the Qingfengdian Campaign last year, individual companies spontaneously adapted and performed the model deeds of their company. These performances were realistic, concise, and lively, and were very popular among the soldiers. However, they were limited to praising models. During the troop training at the end of the year, a unit began to perform "Soldier Acting as Soldier" in close coordination with the central work, which had a significant effect on troop education and the completion of the central work at that time.

In February, the unit's leadership summarized this situation and clearly pointed out that it is a very good form of mass political work, as well as mass self-education, political and cultural education, and literary and artistic activities. Over the past four months, through the attention and advocacy of leaders at all levels, summarizing experiences, publicizing commendations, conducting grand competitions, and organizing visits, most companies have now launched "Soldier Acting as Soldier," and are continuously improving it in terms of content and form. It has progressed from simply praising models and transforming the backward to promoting work and enlivening the troops, and now to completing policy and tactical education and completing the central work through "Soldier Acting as Soldier." When a unit studied policies in May, some companies performed "Fair Trade" and "Mutual Aid Teams" (policy study mutual aid), which greatly helped policy education. When a unit conducted training on Chairman Mao's Ten Military Principles, they turned the situation of various battles over the past year into a large sand table. Everyone participated and performed in the form of "Soldier Acting as Soldier" for everyone to learn, which was very easy for everyone to understand. Because the soldiers themselves adapted and performed their own real events in their own words and in the form they liked best, it was particularly realistic, skillful, easy to perform, and enjoyable to perform. Everyone also found it particularly easy to understand and enjoy watching.

At one evening event, soldiers performed sixteen programs. In May, a unit performed fifty-four programs, with more than two hundred soldiers serving as actors. When a unit conducted grievance education last winter, a company adapted and performed the history and model deeds of Luo Kunhua, a great meritorious person in their company, who suffered from childhood in the landlord's family, was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek army to serve as a soldier, and bravely killed enemies and made great contributions after being liberated into our army. Many people cried after watching it. Many people said, "This is better than class. I understand the two classes of the poor and the rich!" The liberated soldiers Guo Yongde and others cried the most. They said, "The deep hatred of blood can only be avenged in the People's Liberation Army. We swear not to go home until we capture Chiang Kai-shek!" This sparked a wave of "learning from Luo Kunhua." Luo Kunhua was commended and worked even harder himself. During troop training last winter, after the soldiers of the seventh squad of a unit watched the performance of "Tian Jiachen's meritorious service in throwing grenades," Shi Zhuzi went to throw grenades outside the village whenever he had time. He said, "I must surpass Tian Jiachen and have myself adapted into a play!" In a certain operation, a unit had once developed a mood of complaining about hardships and fearing fatigue, and discipline was lax in individual units. Of the twenty-five programs performed by the unit at that time, ten were aimed at promoting a hard-working style. This played a great role in overcoming the then-existing bad tendencies. After a company performed "Hardship Model Zhang Dexiang," many soldiers challenged Zhang Dexiang to compete in hardship. Companies learned from Zhang Dexiang one after another. Now, such public opinion is popular among the soldiers: "Whoever has made a contribution, we will put on a play for him and learn from him; whoever has made a mistake and refuses to correct it, we will put on a play for him and let him correct it!" It is felt to be very convenient to mobilize the masses through "Soldier Acting as Soldier" after the leadership has deployed a task and issued a call.

As a result of "Soldier Acting as Soldier," the soldiers play games and rehearse programs with gongs and drums during their spare time. The obscene and vulgar tunes that individual soldiers brought into the army from the old society have been replaced by this new form of recreational activities. It has also promoted cultural learning in the troops. Many soldiers have learned culture during rehearsals. The actors in the fifth company of a unit who rehearsed "Zhang Lengxiao Believes in the Party Newspaper" took the initiative to study culture because they were interested in the clapper talk.

### 提倡群众性的政治文化自我教育　解放军某部开展兵演兵

　　提倡群众性的政治文化自我教育
  　解放军某部开展兵演兵
    【华北前线十七日电】华北解放军某部，现正普遍开展一种兵演兵运动，由领导上有计划的组织战士自己编排，自己演出，达到自己教育自己、提高自己，并已成为军政工作走群众路线的工作方法之一，创造了部队群众性文艺活动的新方向。
    去年清风店战役前后，该部个别连队自发的把本连的模范事迹自编自演，真实、简短、活泼，很受战士欢迎。但还只限于表扬模范。年底练兵时，某部开始以兵演兵密切配合中心工作演出，对部队教育和完成当时中心工作，收到很大效果。
    二月，该部领导上总结了这种情况，明确指出：它是群众性政治工作，也是群众性自我教育、政治文化教育、文艺活动很好的一种形式。四个月来，经各级领导的重视提倡，总结经验，通报表扬，大竞赛，参观，现在大部分连队都已开展了兵演兵，并在内容与形式上使它日益提高。开始只是从表扬模范，转变落后，以推动工作，活跃部队，现已进到以兵演兵完成政策、战术教育，完成中心工作。某部五月间学习政策时，有的连队演出“买卖公平”、“互助组”（政策学习互助），对政策教育帮助很大；某部进行毛主席十大军事原则训练时，又把我军一年来各战役情况成大砂盘，大家都参加，以兵演兵形式表演出来让大家学习，大家很易明白。由于战士自己把自己的实事，以自己的话，自己最喜爱的形式编演成剧，所以特别逼真、熟练，特别易演、爱演，大家也特别易懂爱看。
    某部在一次晚会上，战士一下演出十六个节目。某部五月份演出五十四个节目，有二百多战士担任演员。某部去冬进行诉苦教育时，某连把他连里的大功臣罗坤华自小在财主家受苦，被蒋军抓去当兵，解放到我军后，英勇杀敌立大功的历史及模范事迹编剧演出，许多人都看哭了，不少人说：“这比上课还强，我闹清穷富两阶级了！”解放战士郭永德等哭得最厉害，他们说：“血海深仇，只有在解放军里才能报，捉不住蒋介石誓不回家！”因此掀起“学习罗坤华”的热潮。罗坤华受到表扬，自己更努力了。去冬练兵时，某部二连演出“田介臣投弹立功”，七班战士石柱子看后，每天有空都到村外投弹，他说：“我一定要超过田介臣，把我也编成剧！”某部在××作战，一度滋长了叫苦怕累情绪，个别单位纪律松懈，该部当时演出的二十五个节目中，就有十个是发扬艰苦作风的。对克服当时不良倾向，起了很大的作用。某连演出“艰苦模范张德祥”后，许多战士就和张德祥挑战比艰苦。各连纷纷向张德祥学习。现在战士中流行着这样的舆论：“谁立了功就给人家上上戏，学习人家；谁犯了错误老不改，就给谁演一演，让他改正！”领导上布置一个工作，发出一个号召，经过兵演兵去发动群众，感到很大的方便。
    由于兵演兵的结果，该部平时课余游戏时，就锣鼓喧天，排演节目。个别战士从旧社会里带来部队的淫词滥调，已为这种新的文娱活动所代替了。并且推动了部队的文化学习，许多战士都在排演中学习了文化。某部五连排演“张楞小相信了党报”的演员们，因对快板感到兴趣，而主动的学习文化。
