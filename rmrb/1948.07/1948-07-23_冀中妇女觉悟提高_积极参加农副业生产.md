　　[News from Central Hebei] Comrade Tian Xiujuan, Director of the Women's Federation of Central Hebei, reported on women's work since the land reform movement at a meeting of women cadres from six counties and cities in the 8th, 9th, and 11th districts of Central Hebei on June 28th. She pointed out that since the land reform movement, women's work has achieved unprecedented depth and development due to the implementation of the Party's policy on women's work by Party committees at all levels and all comrades. The proportion of women who have been mobilized and organized (referring to women who have joined the farmers' association and youth league organizations) generally accounts for about 50% of the total number of women who should be mobilized (referring to poor peasants, farm laborers, middle peasants, and other laboring women who meet the conditions to join the farmers' association and youth league). In better villages, this reaches 80% of the total number of women in the village. According to statistics from 3,606 villages in 15 counties and cities in the 8th and 11th districts, there are 276,647 male members and 277,902 female members in the poor peasant leagues. Women account for more than 50% of the total membership. There are 482,940 male members and 453,588 female members in the new farmers' associations, with women accounting for more than 48% of the total membership. In Shen County, a total of 95,304 women have been mobilized, accounting for approximately 71% of the total number of women who should be mobilized. Through the tempering of struggle, a large number of female activists have been elected as cadres. According to statistics from 19 counties including Xian County, Ding County, and Shen County, there are 26,185 male representatives and 12,818 female representatives in the poor peasant leagues, with women accounting for slightly more than 32% of the total number of representatives. There are 25,582 male representatives and 9,811 female representatives in the new farmers' associations, with women accounting for 27% of the total number of representatives. Women's political awareness has greatly improved and has played a significant role in the military service movement. In six counties and 618 villages in the 11th district, there were 216 glorious mothers, glorious wives, and glorious sisters who sent their children and husbands to join the army. The broad masses of women have changed or are changing their old view that "labor is a shame" and are establishing a new view that labor is glorious. Especially since the land reform, women have been allocated a share of land, and their enthusiasm for production has increased even more. According to a survey in Nanbei Xusima, Raoyang, 60 households have women participating in major labor. In Xinji City and Gaoyang Chengguan, women rarely participated in labor in the past. Now, according to incomplete statistics, more than 5,000 women are participating in labor. After the democratic government's promotion and education, 80% of the women in Xinji City have gradually participated in various handicraft productions. Shi Ruixiang, a woman in Erjie, earns more than 200 jin of rice per month by reeling thread for a factory. Song Rui Duan supports a family of three by reeling thread. Li Dama's family of five completely relies on her to reel thread to maintain their livelihood. This year, women in various regions universally participated in the wheat harvest. In general villages in Lixian County, more than 50% of the women went to the fields to harvest wheat, while in Linbao, the figure was 70%. Women cadres themselves have also been tempered and improved in the land reform, and have made progress in their thinking and work style, and are more united than before. Comrade Tian further pointed out that it is necessary to further mobilize women to produce, and for women's production, specific slogans should be put forward based on the actual local conditions. For example, in the 9th and 11th districts, women already have the habit and foundation of field labor, and agricultural production technology should be improved. In areas with developed sideline industries (such as the Hejian shoe industry), it is necessary to propose strengthening product quality.

　　冀中妇女觉悟提高
  　积极参加农副业生产
    【冀中讯】冀中妇联会主任田秀娟同志在六月二十八日召开的冀中八、九、十一分区六个县市的妇女干部会议上，报告土改运动以来的妇女工作。指出：土改运动以来，由于各级党委和全体同志贯彻了全党作妇女工作的方针，使妇女工作得到了空前的深入和发展。已经发动和组织起来的妇女（指已参加农会及青年团组织的妇女），一般的占应发动妇女（指全村贫雇中农及其他够参加农会及青年团条件之劳动妇女）总数的百分之五十左右。较好的村则达到全村妇女总数的百分之八十。据八、十一分区十五个县市、三千六百零六个村的统计，贫农团男团员二十七万六千六百四十七人，女团员二十七万七千九百零二人。妇女占团员总数的百分之五十以上。新农会男会员四十八万二千九百四十人，女会员四十五万三千五百八十八人，妇女占会员总数百分之四十八以上。深县发动起来的妇女共九万五千三百零四人，约占应发动妇女总数百分之七十一。经过斗争的锻炼，大批妇女积极分子当选了干部；据献县、定县、深县等十九县的统计，贫农团男代表有二万六千一百八十五人，女代表有一万二千八百一十八人，妇女占代表总数的百分之三十二强。新农会男代表二万五千五百八十二人，女代表九千八百一十一人，妇女占代表总数百分之二十七。妇女们的政治觉悟大大提高，在参军运动中起了很大作用。十一分区六个县、六百一十八个村庄，出现了送自己子弟丈夫参军的光荣娘、光荣妻、光荣姐妹等二百一十六人。广大妇女在思想上转变了或正在转变着“劳动为耻辱”的旧观点树立着劳动光荣的新观点，特别自土改以后，妇女分得了一份土地，生产情绪更加高涨。据饶阳南北许司马的调查，有六十户妇女参加主要劳动。辛集市、高阳城关过去妇女很少参加劳动，现在据不完全统计，参加劳动的妇女达五千余人。辛集市经过民主政府的提倡教育，百分之八十的妇女逐渐参加了各种手工业生产。二街妇女石瑞祥给工厂打线，每月赚米二百多斤。宋瑞端靠打线养活了三口人。李大妈全家五口，完全依靠她打线维持生活。今年各地妇女普遍参加麦收，蠡县一般村百分之五十以上的妇女下地收麦。林堡间占百分之七十。妇女干部本身在土改中，也得到了锻炼和提高，在思想作风上前进了一步，比以前团结得多了。田同志继指出：今后要进一步发动妇女生产，而对于妇女生产，要根据当地实际情况，提出具体口号，如在九、十一分区，妇女已有田间劳动的习惯和基础，应提高农业生产技术；在副业发达的地区（如河间鞋业）应提出加强产品质量。
