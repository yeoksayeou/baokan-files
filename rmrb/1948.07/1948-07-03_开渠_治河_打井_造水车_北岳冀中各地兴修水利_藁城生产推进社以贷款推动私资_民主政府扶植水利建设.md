    Democratic Government Supports Water Conservancy Construction
    [Northern Yue News] In Northern Yue, emancipated peasants are actively building water conservancy projects to increase production. The democratic government is using great effort to help them. In Qu Yang's fifth district, there are forty-eight administrative villages. After land reform, they received 58,672 jin of grain in water conservancy loans and 35,420,000 yuan (border currency, same below) in loans from the government. With the help of these grain and money loans, the peasants in eleven villages along the Sha River, including Nanbeishuiyu, Zhifang, and Chande, dug twelve large and small canals, using 4,750 workdays. They created 1,735 mu of beach land, of which 1,068 mu have already been sown this year. Nine villages in the Lulugou area, including Hechian, used 1,080 workdays to dig 226 ponds (small-scale reservoirs), which can irrigate 243 mu of land. The Mengxian United Canal and Saigou Canal have been completed, and three new canals—Jingui She Canal, Xia Hua Canal, and Huili Canal—have been opened, which can irrigate 166 mu of land. Wutai has completed projects such as the Liujiazhuang and Xiufeng Canals. Near Dongye, in villages like Yongxing and Yong'an, the management methods for the canals have been improved, increasing irrigated land by more than 90 mu. The peasants of Dajian'an silted 200 mu of land and organized a land reclamation team, improving 130 mu, all of which have now been sown. The newly opened Beishe East-West Canals in Dingxiang can irrigate 600 mu of land. In the past, more than 1,300 mu of land on both sides of the Puji Canal could not be irrigated. This year, it was decided to release water half a month earlier in the fall specifically to supply irrigation to the downstream areas, which will allow an additional 2,300 mu to be irrigated. The Shunshui Canal being built in Hengqiangwan can protect 12,160 mu of land. The Miaotou village in Pingshan has a total of 115 households. Except for 13 elderly and widowed families, all men, women, and children participated in the canal construction and land reclamation, starting at the end of February, using 32,540 workdays to reclaim more than 440 mu of beach land, which is now planted with 100 mu of black beans and 200 mu of rice. Hujiazhuang village in Lingshou, with the help of the democratic government, reclaimed 120 mu of beach land, which can increase production by 20 dan of miscellaneous grains each year. Recently, at the request of the masses and under the active leadership of Li Yongcheng, director of the New Peasants' Association, thirteen teams have been organized to reclaim another 70 mu of wasteland. The masses are in high spirits. From 1939 onwards, 52,908 mu of land in the twenty-two villages from Baidian to Zhuhe in Zhengding were gradually washed away by the river. The river channel has approached the edges of villages such as Hucun, Taipingzhuang, and Guojiazhuang, which is very dangerous. In order to protect the people's land and lives and property, the government has provided a loan of 300 dan of grain. The county, district, and village have organized river management committees to lead the people in building dikes, preparing to complete them before the rainy season. Diaoqiao Village has already completed a dike four li long, using 1,600 workdays, which can protect 63,000 mu of land from further erosion.

    [Central Hebei News] The Gaocheng County Production Promotion Cooperative convened a meeting of district agricultural loan officers on June 20 to summarize the loan work of the past six months. In the past six months, the county has used loans to drive private capital to develop water conservancy, achieving considerable success. At the beginning, the county promotion cooperative, on the one hand, went to districts and villages to understand the situation and organize, and on the other hand, invested 100 million yuan (border currency, same below) in waterwheel factories, ordering 200 waterwheels. At the same time, it bought 250,000 jin of coal and invested it in four brick kilns, preparing 150,000 bricks, and invested 20 million yuan in lumber yards, anticipating more than 1,000 water buckets. It spent 5 million yuan to buy bamboo tubes, palm fiber, iron wire and other well-drilling equipment. It was distributed according to the needs of the masses, and tried to drive private capital and use floating wealth as much as possible. All loan households, after being approved by the county, could open a loan slip in the cooperative and get the actual goods. Feng Village in the first district, with more than 100 households, borrowed 13.2 million yuan, driving 5 million yuan of private capital. 46 households bought agricultural tools, more than 30 households bought bone meal, and they also repaired six wells, expanding the irrigated land by 120 mu. As of June 20, 34 wells had been drilled in the county, with loans of 48.24 million yuan and use of floating capital of 33.9 million yuan. 142 wells were repaired. Loans totaled 77.28 million yuan, driving 40.99 million yuan of private capital. 19 waterwheels were purchased, with loans of 46.61 million yuan, driving 18.1 million yuan of private capital (not including those completely purchased and repaired by private individuals). 101 waterwheels were repaired, with loans of 72.61 million yuan, driving 19.15 million yuan of private capital. In the past six months, the county has also issued 166.671 million yuan in loans for agricultural tools and livestock, driving 4.193 million yuan of private capital, and buying 165 head of livestock and a set of agricultural tools. In order to solve the fertilizer problem, the county promotion cooperative also sent special personnel to manufacture bone fertilizer and sell it to the masses at low prices. In order to facilitate the purchase of the masses, the bone-steaming boilers were rotated and moved. This decentralized sales method was very popular among the masses.

    [Central Hebei News] Water conservancy construction in Gaocheng County has been greatly developed under the support of the democratic government. The county originally planned to open 14 branch canals throughout the year, and one-half, with a total length of 62 li, had been completed in the spring. Two-fifths of the small branch canals have also been completed. The main canal project has basically been completed. The county newly dug a 420-meter-long diversion river, diverting all the Hutuo River water into the diversion river. The canals cover 50 villages, and 90% of the wheat fields (more than 470,000 mu) have been universally watered once, and one-fourth of the villages have been watered twice. Each village established a water conservancy committee during canal construction to lead the construction. After completion, the water usage methods were stipulated through democratic discussion by the masses, which greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the masses. Last year, there were seven laborers participating in canal digging in Chi Fan Village. This year, there were more than 1,000 participants. Farmers in villages near the branch canals voluntarily contributed more than 20,000 bricks and built 42 new sluice gates, expanding the original irrigated area by two-thirds, enabling irrigation of 8,000 mu of land. Last year, each worker could only dig one to four cubic meters per day, but this year they can dig four to eight cubic meters. Women also actively participated in canal construction. The branch canal project was originally planned to be completed in eight days, but it was completed in five days.

The original manuscript lacks reports on the process and experience. Please continue to report on the construction situation and experience of important projects. The manuscript on Gaocheng's loans to help farmers develop water conservancy should also choose key points to continue to report with specific processes and experience lessons. - Editor)
