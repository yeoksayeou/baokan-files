【Jizhong News】Renqiu Second District's Dongligezhuang has reduced the burden on the masses after overcoming wasteful spending in village finances. The village has a total of 202 households and 3,037 mu of land, with a total burden score of 3,539 points last year. The previous village finance director was a landlord who did not serve the people well. Other village cadres also spent village funds casually, and the leadership did not supervise adequately, resulting in serious waste in village financial expenditures. From January to November of last year, according to incomplete statistics, the village cadres' meeting meal expenses (at restaurants) amounted to 3.81 million yuan (border currency, same below). Seven support-the-front trips (each with four or five people) cost 3.8 million yuan in pocket money alone. During the army expansion, soldiers were hired in disguise, costing eight shi of corn per person, plus 50,000 yuan. Before leaving, they also spent 2.3 million yuan in the village. Including other village burdens, each point was assessed 41 jin of corn. This not only increased the difficulties in the people's lives but also greatly affected their enthusiasm for production. Since the start of the land reform, bad cadres have been replaced, and the masses' awareness has been raised. Systems have been established, and village financial expenditures have been greatly reduced. From November of last year to February of this year, the total expenditure for office expenses and teachers' salaries in four months was 3,942,960 yuan, with each point equivalent to 1,500 yuan. In the management of village finances, the masses publicly elected the Farmers' Association Director as the finance director, with five committee members. All expenditures in the village must be approved by them. A list is posted monthly and announced at mass meetings, allowing the masses to check at any time. Waste has been reduced, the people's burden has been lightened, and the broad masses are very supportive. Middle peasant Liu Zhenquan said, "This is great, and we have more energy to work. The money saved on dispatching can be used to hoe the fields more thoroughly and pedal the loom more diligently."

　　任邱东李各庄
    清理村财政
    【冀中讯】任邱二区东李各庄克服村财政开支的浪费现象后，减轻群众许多负担。该村共二百零二户，三千零卅七亩地，去年全年负担分数为三千五百三十九分。该村过去的村财政主任是个地主，不好好给群众办事，其他村干也随便动用村款，领导上又检查不够，弄得该村在财政开支上发生严重的浪费现象。从去年一月份至十一月份，据不完全统计，村干开会饭费（下饭铺）开支三百八十一万元（边币，下同）·支前七次（每次四、五人），光零花就开支了三百八十万元。扩军时变相雇兵，每人玉米八石，外加五万元。临走前还在村里花了二百三十万元。连上其他村负担，每分摊派玉米四十一斤。不但群众生活上增加了困难，生产情绪也受到很大影响。自土改开始后，撤换了坏干部，提高了群众觉悟，规定了制度，村财政开支立时节省了许多。自去年十一月到今年二月，四个月内办公费、教员薪金共开支三百九十四万二千九百六，十元每分合一千五百元。在村财政的管理上，群众公选农会主任为财政主任，下设五个委员，村中一切开支，都要经过他们许可。每月贴一次清单，在群众大会公布，让群众随时检查。浪费现象减少了，人民负担减轻了，广大群众非常拥护。中农刘振圈说：“这样可不错，干活也有劲了，咱派差钱，把地多锄一遍，织布机多蹬两下就够了。”
