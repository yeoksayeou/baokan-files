　　Voluntary Group Formation and Flexible Labor
    Eight Virtues Weeding is Good and Fast
    [Taihang News] In Changzhi's Fifth District, Eight Virtues Township has changed its leadership style in production, moving away from pursuing formalities and coercive commands. This year's autumn weeding is more meticulous and cleaner than in previous years, which has greatly satisfied the masses. Weeding began in early June, and by the 15th, most of it was completed. Before the weeding began, the village took advantage of the rainy downtime to hold meetings in each street, explaining the Taihang District Party Committee's letter to farmers, cadres, and party members, dispelling various ideological concerns, and mobilizing people to compensate for the rough spring plowing and insufficient fertilization by doing a good job of weeding the autumn seedlings. The village chief first apologized to the masses for his work style: "It was wrong of me to force the masses to dig the land at night last year. This year, we will definitely change this approach when organizing mutual aid production." Some cadres apologized for forcibly merging small groups of four or five households into large groups last year, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some said, "There are too many people in the large mutual aid groups, and there is no chance to work for oneself. Some people still haven't received their wages from last year." Some cadres apologized for focusing on speed rather than quality in leading production last year, saying that if it was said to be completed in half a month, they always had to rush to finish it in ten days. After many autumn stubble fields were dug, the stubble was still there. Someone said: Last year, when mutual aid was expanded, people with children could not go to the fields with adults and could not learn how to cultivate seeds, and the children were all spoiled. Women had to pay more wages if they couldn't go to the fields, so they felt that mutual aid was not worthwhile. After the self-criticism, the village cleared last year's wages in each group, and at the same time, let the masses reorganize mutual aid voluntarily, with cadres and active elements in production as the core, forming groups at will, regardless of size. During weeding, each group worked according to the specific situation, and there was no longer any forced deadline, which greatly satisfied the masses. Most of the mutual aid groups in Zhongnan Street had collapsed in the past, but this time they voluntarily reunited, and the weeding was very good and fast. Many children (semi-laborers) and women in the village participated in weeding and seedling pulling, and the masses felt that "the whole family is working hard." Even the old widow Ge Dui, who is over fifty years old, has weeded her more than three mu of land. The masses said, "This year, no one is giving us a deadline, so we can weed properly."

　　自愿结组按具体情况做活
    八义锄苗又好又快
    【太行讯】长治五区八义镇改变了领导生产中追求形式与强迫命令作风，今年秋苗锄得比往年精细、干净，群众都很满意。锄苗从六月初开始，至十五日，大部都已锄完。该村在锄苗开始前即乘下雨的闲暇时候，分街开会，讲解太行区党委告农民、干部、党员书，解除各种思想顾虑，发动以好好锄苗来弥补春耕粗糙与上粪不足的缺陷。村长首先向群众检讨自己的作风：“去年强迫群众黑夜掘地，就是咱的不对，今年组织互助生产，一定改变这种作法。”有的干部检讨去年把四、五户以下的小组强制合并成大组，引起群众不满。有的说：“大互助人太多，轮不上给自己做活。有的去年工资，今年还要不了。”有的干部检讨去年领导生产光图快，不图好，说的半月完成，总要十天赶完。好多秋茬地掘过以后，茬子还在。有人说：去年扩大互助，人家有孩子不能跟着大人上地，学不会养种，孩子都荒唐坏啦。妇女不能上地得多出工资，所以觉得互助不上算。检讨后，一面在各组清理去年工资，一面放手由群众自愿重整互助，以干部及生产中的积极分子为核心，随意结组，大小不拘。锄苗时各组按情况做活，不再强迫限期完成，群众都很满意。中南街大部互助组过去都已垮台，这次又自愿结合起来，锄得很好也很快。村里有很多小孩（半劳力）和妇女都参加了锄苗、拔苗，群众觉得“全家满吃劲。”连五十多岁的老寡妇圪堆老婆也把自己三亩多地锄好了。群众说：“今年没人给咱限期，咱就能好好锄了。”
