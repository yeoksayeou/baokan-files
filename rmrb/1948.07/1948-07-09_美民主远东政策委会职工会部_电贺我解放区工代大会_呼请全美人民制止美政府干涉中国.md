Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: According to a Prague dispatch from TASS on the 2nd, quoting the Czech Telegraph Agency: The Trade Union Department of the American "Democratic Far East Policy Committee," representing twenty-four national trade unions, has cabled congratulations to the All-China Liberated Area Workers' Congress to be held in Harbin in July. The congratulatory telegram stated: "This congratulation expresses the American people's traditional and profound friendship with the Chinese people." The telegram sternly denounced the US reactionary authorities' imperialist policy towards China of enslaving the Chinese people, stating: "The US government is pursuing a policy in China of intervening on the side of the reactionary forces, prolonging the suffering of the Chinese people. This is part of the overall foreign policy of the American reactionaries in pursuit of military goals. This policy has brought the shackles of enslavement to the working people of China; and for American workers, it means today's shockingly high cost of living and tomorrow's threat of war. We call on all American people to demand an end to all interference in China's internal affairs."

　　美民主远东政策委会职工会部
    电贺我解放区工代大会
    呼请全美人民制止美政府干涉中国
    【新华社陕北七日电】据塔斯社二日布拉格电引捷克电报通讯社消息：美国“民主远东政策委员会”职工会部代表二十四个全国性的职工会，顷电贺将于七月间在哈尔滨召开的全中国解放区工人代表大会。该贺电称：“这祝贺表示出美国人民对中国人民传统的深挚的友谊。”该电对美国反动当局奴役中国人民的帝国主义的对华政策，加以严正斥责称：“美国政府在中国奉行着站在拖延中国人民苦难的反动派方面进行干涉的政策。这是美国反动派追求军事目的之整个对外政策的一部分。这一政策，给中国劳动人民带来了奴役的桎梏；而对美国工人，它意味着今日的生活费用惊人高涨及明日的战争威胁。我们吁请全体美国人民要求停止对中国国内事务的一切干涉。”
