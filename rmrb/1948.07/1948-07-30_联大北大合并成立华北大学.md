　　United University and Peking University Merged to Form North China University
    [This Newspaper News] The former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region's United University of North China and the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region's Northern University have formally merged to form North China University. Wu Yuzhang serves as the president, and Fan Wenlan and Cheng Fangwu serve as vice presidents. The school's main task is to absorb a large number of college and middle school students from the KMT-controlled areas, train them in a short period, and cultivate them into construction cadres in various fields. It is now decided to establish three departments: a short-term political training class, a College of Education, and a College of Arts, as well as a Research Department, which is further divided into research offices for history, philosophy, and other subjects. The preparatory work for the merger of the two schools is now largely completed, and it is reported that a formal founding ceremony will be held in mid-August.
