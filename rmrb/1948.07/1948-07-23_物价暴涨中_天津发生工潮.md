Xinhua News Agency, North China, 20th: According to a July 2nd report in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, amidst rampant inflation, workers at the Tianjin branch of the British-owned Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Company's lighterage department, as well as cinema workers throughout Tianjin, initiated strikes and slowdowns respectively, demanding higher wages. Workers at the Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Company's lighterage department, protesting that their June salary index only doubled, demanded a two-and-a-half-fold increase in accordance with the price index, and when this was not met, began a slowdown at the end of June. At that time, 6,000 tons of cargo awaiting transport at Tanggu were completely stalled. Employees in other departments of the company successively signed on in support, with workers in the shipping and warehouse departments also planning slowdowns. All cinemas in Tianjin were forced to close on the afternoon of July 1st due to strikes by the workers. According to representatives from the cinema workers, the workers' lives had reached the point of unsustainability. In June, prices soared several times over (on June 26th, rice in the city had already risen to 360,000 yuan per catty, and flour to 16 million yuan per bag), while workers' average salaries were only 3.5 million yuan per month (not even enough to buy ten catties of rice or flour), and they had to provide for their own meals. Workers demanded a three-fold increase in wages, but the capitalists only agreed to add 70-80%, forcing the workers to strike. Furthermore, according to a July 2nd report in the Tianjin Xin Xing Bao: On July 7th, the Jiang-affiliated New Harbor Engineering Bureau in Tanggu colluded with a company of Jiang's bandit troops, setting up machine guns and using "suppression of the rebellion" and the need to cover "emergency expenditures" as pretexts to forcibly lay off approximately 870 employees, after first arresting more than ten workers.

　　物价暴涨中
  　天津发生工潮
    【新华社华北二十日电】据天津大公报七月二日消息：在物价狂烈上涨中，天津英商太古轮船公司轮驳部职工及津市全市电影院工人，均因要求提高待遇，而先后罢工、怠工。英商太古轮船公司轮驳部职工因为抗议六月薪金指数仅增一倍，要求按照物价指数增加两倍半未获结果，遂于六月底举行怠工。当时塘沽六千吨待运货物，全部停滞。该公司其他各部职员亦相继签名响应，其中轮船、仓库部职员正酝酿怠工。津市各电影院则于本月一日下午已由于职工举行罢工而全部被迫停演，据该业职工方面谈称：该业工人生活实已至无法维持境地，六月份物价跳了好几倍（按六月二十六日该市大米每斤已涨至三十六万元，面粉每袋一千六百万元），而工人待遇平均每人每月仅得三百五十万元（即还买不到十斤大米或面粉），并且伙食须尚自理。工人要求增资三倍，资方仅允加七、八成，致工人被迫举行罢工。另据天津新星报本月二日讯：塘沽蒋记新港工程局于七月七日串同蒋匪军一连人，架起机关枪，以“戡乱”和须应付“紧急开支”为借口，强迫裁掉职工约八百七十余人，事先并逮捕职工十余人。
