　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 2nd: During the liberation of Kaifeng, the people of the Yu-Wan-Su Fifth Military Sub-district (which governs nine counties including Xihua, Fugou, Xuchang, and Tongxu) enthusiastically supported the front lines. The area was originally only supposed to mobilize 900 stretchers and 600 carts, but within five days, the locals had automatically gathered 1,500 stretchers; Tongxu and Kaichen (a newly established county between Kaifeng and Chenliu) alone dispatched 600 carts. The concentration of stretchers was very rapid. Tongxu County issued a mobilization notice in the second half of the first day, and by the night of the next day, it had gathered 196 stretchers. The newly liberated Kaichen County gathered 116 stretchers and 113 carts in just one and a half days. The civilian laborers everywhere were extremely enthusiastic and determined to complete their tasks. Of the 250 stretchers supporting a certain unit, only one was lost along the way. Zhao Hui Village in Tongxu sent three stretchers and sixteen people. Except for one person who was sent to the hospital due to illness, the rest completed their tasks and had no complaints despite the day and night transportation. When Kaifeng was indiscriminately bombed by enemy planes, the civilian laborers who had been evacuated to avoid the air raids were able to quickly regroup and continue working after the all-clear signal. An old man over sixty years old, Ma Fuchen, also automatically drove his cart to deliver grain to the People's Liberation Army. When the PLA logistics personnel thanked him for his enthusiasm, the old man said, "You must drive away Chiang Kai-shek! Chiang Kai-shek robs people, takes livestock, and conscripts young men, making life impossible! The People's Liberation Army is of one mind and has righteousness; the Central Army is evil, and collapses as soon as they see the People's Liberation Army!"

　　开封战役中豫皖苏新区人民热烈支前
    【新华社开封前线二日电】解放开封战役中，豫皖苏五分区（五分区辖西华、扶沟、许昌、通许等九个县）新解放区人民热烈支援前线。该区原仅拨动员九百付担架、六百辆大车，但五天内各地即自动集中了一千五百付担架；仅通许、开陈（新设县，开封陈留之间）两县就出动大车六百辆。担架集中非常迅速，通许县于一日下半夜发出集中通知，至第二天夜里就集中了一百九十六付。刚解放了的开陈县，仅一夜又半天的时间就集中了一百一十六付担架，一百一十三辆大车。各地民工都热情极高，坚决完成任务。支援某部的二百五十付担架中，只有一付中途失散。通许赵辉村出了三付担架、十六个人中除一人因病送医院外，其余都完成了任务，虽日夜转运，都毫无怨言。当开封遭敌机滥肆轰炸时，疏散防空的民工在解除警报后，都能很快的又集合起来继续工作。一位年逾六十的老人马傅臣，也自动赶着大车赶来给解放军送粮食。当解放军后勤负责人员对他这种热心表示感谢时，这位老人说：“可要赶走蒋介石啊！蒋介石抢东西，牵牲口，抓壮丁，日子无法过啦！解放军都是一条心，是正气；中央军是邪气，一见解放军就完蛋啦！”
