　　[Hebei Central News] The oil pressing industry in Old Shulu City was well-known before the Incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War). The city had a total of 13 oil mills, 115 empty oil presses, 11 oil vats, 78 oil rollers, 5 diesel engines, and 4 electric rollers, employing 150 oil workers. Calculating for 10 months of work per year, it could press 3 million jin of soybean oil, cottonseed oil, and peanut oil, and around 22 million jin of oil cake. The products were sold as far as Tianjin, Beijing, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and Shandong. The self-made sanitary oil (made from cottonseed oil) was sold to Guangdong and Guangxi, and Yunnan and Guizhou through Tianjin. Oil cakes were supplied to nearby counties for fertilizer or for feeding pigs and cattle. After the Incident, the oil industry was devastated by the Japanese invaders and completely collapsed. After liberation, with the support of our democratic government, it gradually recovered. Oil mills such as Guangcheng and Huaxing have started operations one after another. When industrial and commercial taxes were collected last year, in-depth investigation and research were lacking, and some burdens were unfairly distributed. Most oil mills had small capital and a shortage of raw materials. When the review was conducted last year, the manager of the Sihe Oil Mill was detained. Some other industrial and commercial sectors were encroached upon during this land reform, which affected the peace of mind of some oil mill managers or employees. These subjective and objective reasons greatly affected the development of the oil industry. Since the correction of errors began this year, the manager of Sihe Oil Mill was first released to help him resume business. The bank established overdraft transactions with the oil mills to solve their capital difficulties. Many oil mills have resumed operations one after another. In order to expand operations, eight oil mills recently discussed organizing themselves to go out to purchase raw materials and sell finished products in a unified manner to open up sales channels. The bank also provided 100 million yuan (border currency) to help them purchase raw materials. With the support of the government and the strengthening of the leadership of the trade union over the employees, the labor-capital relationship was properly resolved, and the workers' production enthusiasm was greatly improved. According to the general practice, each person processed 4 shi and 4 dou of raw materials per day. Workers in factories such as Jugong and Huaxing increased it to 5 shi and 4 dou per person per day. Now, 12 oil mills have been restored in the town, with 45 empty oil presses, 8 oil vats, 48 oil rollers, 2 diesel engines, and 1 electric roller. The daily output is 4,500 jin of oil and nearly 50,000 jin of oil cake. The oil production has recovered to 40% of the pre-war level.

　　束鹿旧城油业逐渐恢复
    每日产油四千余斤
    【冀中讯】束鹿旧城的榨油业，事变前就很有名。全市共十三家油坊，有一百一十五空油榨，十一个油槽，七十八盘油碾，并有五部柴油机，四个电滚子，打油工人有一百五十人。一年以工作十个月计算，能榨豆油、棉花籽油、花生油三百万斤，油饼二千二百万斤上下。产品远销于平津、开封、太原、山东等地。自制的卫生油（棉子油制），经过天津，销到两广和云贵。油饼供销附近各县，做肥料或喂猪、喂牛。事变后，油业遭日寇摧残，完全倒闭。解放后在我民主政府扶植下逐渐恢复，先后有广成、华兴等油坊开工。去年征收工商税时，未能深入调查研究，有的负担不公；大部油坊资本小、原料缺；去年复查时，四合油坊经理被扣，此次土改中侵犯了一些其他工商业，因此影响了一些油坊经理或职员不安心经营；这些主观客观的原因使油业发展受到很大影响。自今年开始纠偏后，首先将四合油坊的经理放回，帮助他恢复营业。银行与油坊建立了透支来往，解决他们的资本困难。许多油坊先后复业。为了扩大经营，最近八座油坊商议着组织起来外出统一购买原料，推销成品，开辟销路；银行并以一亿元（边币）扶助他们采购原料。油坊得到政府的扶植，职工会加强了对职工的领导，正确解决了劳资关系，工人生产情绪大大提高了。一般旧例每日每人打四石四斗原料，聚公、华兴等厂工人增到每人每日打五石四斗。现全镇已恢复油坊十二座，油榨四十五空，油槽八个。油碾四十八盘，柴油机两个，电滚子一个；每天出油四千五百斤，油饼近五万斤，产油量已恢复到战前百分之四十。
