　　Taiyue Rewards More Livestock Feeding
　　Jiyuan Increases Livestock by More Than 2,000 Head in Half a Year
    [Taiyue Electric] The Taiyue Democratic Government rewards and helps the masses increase livestock and develop rural productivity. The Administrative Office promulgated measures on June 1st to reward livestock feeding, stipulating that for livestock purchased before bearing burdens this year, one-third of the purchase price will be deducted when bearing burdens. A portion of the animal feed will also be deducted. Many counties stipulate that if working livestock suffer losses, the government will provide compensation and treatment. The government has also issued large loans to help farmers purchase and breed. Many villages have compensated the losses of middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, and they have begun to purchase livestock and engage in business with peace of mind. In Xiajiao Village, Er District, Yicheng, the day after compensating the losses of wrongly struggled against middle peasants, someone bought three head of livestock. After compensating the losses of middle peasants in Pang Village, Gaoping, middle peasant Wu Jizhou said: "Now there's nothing to be afraid of, we must engage in production well in the future!" and immediately went to buy an ox. Tan Renyan and others from Yang Village, Jiang County, after receiving grain from the government as compensation for livestock losses in the war effort, said: "Now we don't have to be afraid, if livestock are requisitioned and something goes wrong, the government will still compensate!" and immediately partnered with others to buy livestock. Jiyuan County has increased its livestock by more than 2,000 head this year, and Qin County has increased by more than 1,000 head. Jincheng Sixth District alone increased by 119 head, seven villages in Gaoping First District increased by 220 head, and sixteen villages in Fushan Third District increased by 215 head. Currently, the leadership in various regions is also promptly emphasizing that in mutual aid teams, labor exchange must be carried out at equal value, overcoming the past mistakes of unilaterally taking care of households without livestock and not implementing the principle of equal value exchange. This further encourages households with livestock to feed and breed with peace of mind.
　　[Taiyue News] The Jiyuan Democratic Government has promoted the raising of more livestock in various ways, and the county has increased its livestock by more than 2,000 head in the past six months. In order to reward livestock breeding, the regulations on exemption from labor service for breeding male animals, pregnant female animals, and young animals with two pairs of teeth are resolutely implemented in war service, and compensation and medical treatment are given for those injured or killed in service. In March, the government spent 2.07 million (Ji banknotes) on medical and compensation expenses, thereby dispelling the masses' concerns about being afraid of labor service and unwilling to raise more livestock. After the outbreak of livestock plague this spring, a forum of veterinarians was immediately convened, and ten veterinarians were organized to go to the countryside to treat livestock, saving more than 500 sick livestock from death. The method of encouraging veterinarians to take on more apprentices was promoted to develop the business. In addition, a forum of livestock breeding experts from the county was convened to overcome the misconception that breeding is an "ugly thing" and the neglect of breeding, and a banner was awarded to breeding expert Huang Cunkai. Currently, there are four or five people in the county who specialize in this business, which greatly facilitates livestock breeding. In the mutual aid production movement, the county party committee and government repeatedly emphasized to cadres at all levels that "livestock mutual aid must be equal and voluntary," overcoming the erroneous view of cadres unilaterally "taking care of households without livestock," and gradually dispelling the masses' concerns about suffering losses from mutual aid in raising livestock. The government's stipulated deduction of one-third of the purchase price and reward measures are resolutely implemented in terms of burdens. After the masses' various concerns were eliminated, they all tried to add to the purchase of livestock. In the Seventh District, there were 3,840 head of livestock last winter, and by the end of June this year, there were 4,345 head, an increase of 505 head. In Taixing Village, First District, more than 20 new livestock were bought, and 13 good ones were exchanged. Now, the entire village of 250 households has an average of one head of livestock per household. Wu Yan and Huang Zhuang villages in the Seventh District worked hard on transportation this spring and bought 30 head of livestock with the money they earned. The county has increased its livestock by a total of 2,114 head in the past six months. Last year, each livestock in the county had to cultivate an average of 49 mu, 5 fen and 7 li of land. This year, it has been reduced to 33 mu, which is a considerable guarantee for intensive cultivation.
　　[Another Dispatch] The Shiqiu Donkey Breeding Cooperative in Yicheng has bred 54 donkeys in the past six months. During the production conference held in the county last December, it was discovered that the shortage of livestock was a major difficulty in production in various places. According to calculations in the Second and Third Districts, if each livestock could cultivate 35 mu of land, there would be a shortage of 2,005 head of livestock. At that time, Manager Ma of the Cooperative Committee called on everyone to organize the masses to establish donkey breeding cooperatives and develop livestock breeding on a large scale. The democratic government stipulated that donkeys and those in charge of breeding could be exempted from labor service, and loans were provided to help. The cadres of Shiqiu returned to the village and studied with all the cadres, borrowed 210,000 yuan (Ji banknotes), bought a donkey, established a breeding cooperative, and welcomed everyone to join. More than four months have passed and 54 breeds have been bred, guaranteeing that 40 small donkeys can be born. The county government commended this cooperative.

　　太岳奖励多喂牲口
  　济源半年增畜两千余头
    【太岳电】太岳民主政府奖励与帮助群众增加牲畜，发展农村生产力。行署于六月一日颁布奖励喂牲口的办法，规定凡在本年出负担以前买上的牲口，出负担时扣除买价三分之一。并扣除畜料一部分。许多县份规定服勤牲口受到损失时，政府给以赔偿和治疗。政府又发放大批贷款，帮助农民购买与繁殖。不少村庄补偿了错斗中农的损失，他们开始购买牲口，安心经营。翼城二区下交村头一天补偿错斗中农的损失，第二天就有人买了三头牲口。高平庞村补偿中农损失后，中农吴继周说：“这可不害怕了，以后要好好闹生产哩！”马上去买了一条牛。绛县杨村谭人彦等在政府领了参战损失牲口的赔偿麦子后说：“这可不怕了，牲口支差出了岔子，政府还管赔呢！”立刻和别人合伙买了牲口。济源全县今年增加牲口两千多头，沁县增加一千多头。晋城只六区就增加了一百一十九头，高平一区七个村增加了二百二十头，浮山三区十六个村增加了二百十五头。现各地领导上又及时强调提出在互助组里变工，必须进行等价交换，克服过去片面的照顾没牲口户、不执行等价交换原则的错误。更鼓励了有牲口户安心喂养与繁殖。
    【太岳讯】济源民主政府从各方面提倡群众多养牲口，半年来全县增加牲口两千多头。为了奖励牲口繁殖，在战勤上坚决执行配种公畜、怀胎母畜、二对牙小畜免勤的规定，并对服勤伤亡的给予赔偿和医药治疗，三月份政府支出医药费与赔偿费二百零七万（冀钞），因此解除了群众怕支差不愿多养牲口的顾虑。在今春发现牲口瘟疫后，立即召集了兽医座谈会，组织十个兽医下乡给牲口看病，使五百多个得病牲口免于死亡。在兽医中提倡多带徒弟的办法，发展业务。另外又召集了全县牲口配种能手座谈会，克服了一般人认为配种是“丑事”，轻视配种的错误看法，并奖励配种能手黄存凯一面锦旗。现全县已有四五个人专门经营这种业务，大大便利了牲口的繁殖。在互助生产运动中，县委与政府向各级干部反复强调“牲口互助，必须等价自愿”，克服了干部片面的“照顾没牲口户”的错误观点，逐渐解除了群众养牲口怕互助吃亏的顾虑。在负担上坚决执行政府所规定扣除买价的三分之一，奖励办法。群众的各种顾虑消除以后，都设法添买牲口。七区去冬有牲口三千八百四十头，迄今年六月底，已有四千三百四十五头，增加了五百零五头。一区太行村新买牲口二十多个，又换了十三个好的，现在全村二百五十户，已平均到每户有一头牲口。七区吴彦、黄庄两村，今春努力搞运输，用赚的钱买了牲口三十头。全县半年来共增加了牲口二千一百十四头。去年全县每个牲口平均要耕地四十九亩五分七。今年已减为三十三亩，相当的保证了精耕细作。
    【又讯】翼城石丘牡驴配种合作社，半年来配种五十四个。去年十二月全县开生产会议时，各地发现牲口缺少是生产上的大困难。据二、三两区计算，如能作到每个牲口耕种三十五亩地，就短少二千零五头牲口。当时合作委员会马经理，号召大家组织群众成立牡驴配种合作社，大量配种发展牲口。民主政府规定牡驴和管配种的人可以免差，并予贷款帮助。石丘干部回村和全体干部研究，贷款二十一万元（冀钞），买了一个牡驴，成立配种合作社，并欢迎大家入股，四个多月已配了五十四个种，保证可下四十个小驴。县政府表扬了这个合作社。
