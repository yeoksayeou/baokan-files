Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Reports from various sources: The staged general strike of workers in various industries across Italy, led by the Italian General Confederation of Labour and of a "symbolic demonstration" nature, has been held successively from the 6th to the 12th as scheduled, following the 2nd. The national chemical workers' strike was on the 6th, the national electricity workers' strike was on the 7th, the national steel workers' strike was on the 8th, the national glass, pottery, and sugar workers' strike was on the 9th, and the national gas workers' strike was on the 12th. A total of approximately three million people participated in the staged general strike from the 6th to the 12th, with the largest being the steel workers' strike, involving 850,000 people. The direct purpose of the strike is to demand wage increases, but it also has significant political implications. The Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour issued a public statement on the 7th stating that if the employers (Federation of Industrialists) remain stubborn, the Executive Committee will consider a national general strike if necessary. The public statement of the Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour also stated that the trade union committees of the northern Italian states are scheduled to meet in Milan on the 11th, and the trade union committees of the central and southern states will also hold consultations in Naples. The General Confederation of Labour will base its further actions on the opinions of these state trade unions.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS reports: The Italian government has taken a series of reactionary measures to suppress the strike movement that has surged in Italy in recent weeks. According to "The People's Paper," the organ of Gasperi, the Council of Ministers has reiterated its intention to enact legislation restricting the right of the working people to strike. Interior Minister Scelba has drafted a plan to immediately militarize the railways, post offices, telecommunications, and many other departments when workers in these departments demand wage increases and call for strikes. In addition to military and political measures, the government is planning to establish strike-breaking teams to counter trade unions and the strike movement. The Italian government has decided to adopt the so-called "Fanfani (Minister of Labour) Plan," attempting to place the entire burden of the crisis and the resumption of work in the country on the shoulders of the working people. The Italian government has also promulgated another "Labor Service" decree drafted by Fanfani regarding the establishment of the obligations of the unemployed, as a means of organized strike-breaking. These measures of the Italian government have aroused widespread anger among the working people. Various democratic newspapers have strongly protested the "Fanfani Plan," which is only supported by the Christian Democratic Party, and the newspapers demand that this plan be amended during parliamentary debate.

　　意各业工人行动一致
    分期罢工按期举行
    反动政府阴谋进行破坏
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方报导：具有“象征示威”性质的意大利总工会所领导的全国各业工人分期总罢工，继二日之后，已于六日至十二日按期陆续举行。六日为全国化学工人的罢工，七日为全国电力工人的罢工，八日为全国钢铁工人的罢工，九日为全国玻璃、陶器和制糖工人的罢工，十二日为全国煤气工人的罢工。总计约有三百万人参加自六日至十二日的分期总罢工，其中最大的一次是钢铁工人的罢工，计有八十五万人参加。罢工的直接目的是要求增资，同时亦具有重大的政治意义。总工会执委会于七日发表公报称，如雇主们（工业家联合会）的态度顽固不变，在必要时，执委会将考虑全国总罢工。总工会执委会之公报又称，意北之各州之工会委员会定于十一日在米兰集会，中部及南部各州之工会委员会亦于那不勒斯举行会商。总工会将根据这些州工会的意见，以决定其进一步的行动。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社报导：意大利政府已采取一连串反动措施，以镇压最近数周在意大利风起云涌的罢工运动。据加斯贝利的机关报“人民报”称，部长会议已再度表明欲制定限制劳动人民罢工权利的立法。内政部长谢尔巴已拟就当铁路、邮局、电讯及其他许多部门之工人要求增资而号召罢工时立即将这些部门军事化的计划。除军事和政治的措施外，政府正计划建立罢工破坏队，以对付职工会和罢工运动。意政府已决定采取所谓“法凡尼（劳工部长）计划”，企图将危机及国内恢复工作的全部负担，放在劳动人民的肩上。意政府又颁布由法凡尼起草的另一关于确立失业者义务的“劳动服务”法令，作为有组织的破坏罢工的手段。意政府的这些措施，已激起劳动人民的普遍愤怒。各民主报纸严重抗议只受到基督教民主党支持的“法凡尼计划”，各报要求在国会辩论中修改这一计划。
