　　Taihang News: During the wheat protection battle in Lijia Mountain, Northern Henan, a certain unit strictly implemented the battlefield discipline. Not a single person took anything from the prisoners or beat or scolded them. Soldiers of the Fourth and Fifth Companies, after capturing the enemy, saw that the prisoners were emaciated from hunger, so they gave them the dry rations they had brought for combat. The medical personnel of our army immediately applied medicine and bandages to most of the wounded Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers on the battlefield. A squad from the Sixth Company escorted prisoners to the rear. Along the way, they explained the policies to them. When a wounded prisoner couldn't walk, the soldiers helped him. When they arrived at Cuqiao Village, the prisoners were hungry and wanted to drink water, so the soldiers tried to find rice soup for them to drink. The prisoners were so moved that they shed tears.

　　豫北我军某部严格执行俘虏政策
    【太行讯】豫北李家山保麦战中，某部严格执行了战场纪律，没有一人拿俘虏的东西或打骂他们。四、五连战士在俘敌后、看见俘虏饿的面黄饥瘦，便把自己带的作战干粮送给他们吃。战场上负伤的蒋顽匪军，我卫生员大部立即给他们敷了药、上了绷带。六连一个班往后方送俘虏，一路走一路给他们解释政策，一个负了伤的俘虏走不动，战士即扶他走。到了崔桥村，俘虏肚饿了，又想喝水，战士即设法给他们找米汤喝。俘虏感动的落下泪来。　　　　　　　（杜明）
