(Jilu Yu Electric) Under the leadership and assistance of the working group of the prefectural committee, Chalu Village in the Fourth District of Nanfeng has launched a surge of planting. Initially, the Chalu working group did not adopt the method of first having a few households set an example, gain experience, and then promote it throughout the village, but only made general calls for planting and watering seedlings, which resulted in failure. The comrades of the working group were very anxious and conducted self-criticism, deciding to start with the branch. They held a branch meeting, educating and calling on party members to take the lead in guiding the masses to plant and water seedlings. Party members recognized the importance and benefits of planting and responded unanimously to the call to "work at the forefront." The next day, Wu Mingyun and Wu Qiyun started working. Wu Mingyun dug holes and spread fertilizer while planting seedlings, with one person digging holes and two people carrying water, planting 400 sweet potato seedlings in half a day. That evening, a farmers' meeting was held, using Wu Mingyun's example to publicize to the masses, and the masses calculated the benefits in groups: one mu of sweet potatoes can produce 1,000 jin, which can replace two mu of grain. As long as the sweet potatoes are harvested, there will be no fear in the second half of the year. Through this typical demonstration and accounting method, the masses' thinking was cleared, and they all felt that it would be impossible to plant if it was too late. The next day, the old village chief Wu Dongyun also carried water and planted seedlings. Activist Bai Junqi and his seventh uncle helped each other to plant. His ten-year-old son scattered seedlings and watered them, and his fifteen-year-old daughter spread fertilizer. He and his seventh uncle dug holes. The whole family, young and old, planted 500 seedlings in one day. In the evening, the couple sealed the soil one by one while it was cool, which greatly influenced the masses. The next day, they continued to plant 800 seedlings, which had a great impact on the masses. In the evening, the Junqi couple was praised by the loudspeaker, explaining how much they had planted and what the benefits were, which enlightened the masses throughout the village. By June 5th, a planting boom had formed throughout the village. Ma Jifu planted 1,400 seedlings in two nights. Some people regretted and said, "It would have been so good to plant a few days earlier!" Others said, "It's not too late to start now, it won't work if it's any later."

　　党员带头推动全村岔楼积极抗旱点种
    【冀鲁豫电】南峰四区岔楼村在地委工作组的领导帮助下，掀起点种热潮。最初岔楼工作组没有采用先由几户作出样子，取得经验，推动全村的办法，只是一般的号召点种浇苗，结果落了空。工作组同志很着急，自己作了检讨，决定先从支部作起。开了支部大会，教育、号召党员先作起来，带头引导群众点种浇苗。党员认识到点种的重要和好处，一致响应“干到头里”的号召。第二天吴明云、吴其云就下了手，吴明云一面挖坑撒粪，一面栽秧，一个人捣坑，两个人担水，一晌就栽了四百棵红薯。当晚召开农民大会，用吴明云的事实当样子向群众宣传，群众分伙算起帐来：一亩红薯能出一千斤，能顶二亩粮食吃，只要收了红薯，下半年就不怕了。经过这种典型示范和算帐的方法，打通了群众的思想，都感觉再晚了想栽也栽不成了。第二天，老村长吴东云也挑水栽起来。积极分子白俊起和他七叔互助栽，十岁的儿子散秧浇水，十五岁的女儿撒粪，他和七叔捣坑，一家男女老少，一天栽了五百棵，晚上，俩口子又趁凉一棵一棵封上土。第二天接着又栽了八百棵，影响群众很大。晚上用广播筒表扬了俊起夫妇，说明他们栽了多少，有啥好处，启发了全村群众。到六月五日，全村形成了栽种热潮。马吉服两晚上就栽了一千四百棵。有的人后悔说：“早几天栽了有多好？”有的说：“这时下手还不晚，再晚就不行了。”
