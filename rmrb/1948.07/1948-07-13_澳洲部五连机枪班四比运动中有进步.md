[Frontline News] The Machine Gun Squad of the Fifth Company of the Australian Unit has made significant progress through the Four-Comparison (comparing bravery, comparing skills, comparing discipline, comparing hardship) movement. Since advancing into Chahar South, in the past three months, the squad has been supplemented with three new soldiers and three liberated soldiers, and has participated in three battles without any desertions or casualties. The squad leader, Zhang Shazi (Zhang the Fool), used to have serious remnants of warlordism; he would glare when he spoke, and the soldiers in the squad never dared to offer opinions. The deputy squad leader, Geng Gouba, was consistently lax and indifferent to the problems in the squad. When the Four-Comparison movement was launched, everyone offered them many opinions, and the squad leader and deputy squad leader immediately resolved to overcome their past shortcomings. At the same time, everyone also conducted a deep self-examination and resolved to correct their shortcomings. They found comparison targets for each other and handed the comparison conditions to the squad leader for safekeeping. When problems arose, the squad would raise them for examination of their resolve. After the Four-Comparison, Squad Leader Zhang never lost his temper and always led by example. In one battle, the liberated soldier Sun Caixiao's clothes were soaked by the rain, and Zhang Shazi exchanged his own clothes and bedding for him, moving Sun to the point of speechlessness. In the later stages of the march, Zhang also carried seven shells for the small artillery group in addition to his machine gun. Deputy Squad Leader Geng Gouba's feet were blistered and ulcerated, but he did not fall behind, influencing soldier Zhang Lengxiao to persevere as well. Problems that the squad could solve on its own were resolved in squad meetings. Once, when the soldiers were too tired during a march, soldier Zhang Jinfu cursed in the street. After arriving at the encampment, the squad leader conducted kind criticism at the squad meeting, and after the meeting, he solicited opinions from the soldiers on whether he had any problems in his attitude. The liberated soldier Zhang Lengxiao thought about escaping after entering Chahar South, but with the active help and patient education of the squad leader, deputy squad leader, and the entire squad, he has transformed into an activist. Currently, five people in the squad have been credited with minor merits. (Gu Ping)

　　澳洲部五连机枪班四比运动中有进步
    【前线讯】澳洲部五连机枪班，经过四比（比勇敢、比技术、比纪律、比艰苦）运动，有了显著进步。该班自挺进察南以来，三个多月中，补了三个新战士，三个解放战士，参加三次战斗，无一逃亡和伤亡。该班班长张傻子，过去军阀残余很严重，一说话就瞪眼，班里战士从来不敢提意见。副班长耿勾巴一贯散漫，对班里问题不闻不问。开展四比时，大家给他们提了许多意见，正副班长即决心克服过去缺点，同时大家也做了深刻检查，并决心改正缺点，相互找了比的对象，把比的条件交班长保存，发生问题时，班里就提出检查决心。四比以后，张班长从未发过脾气，处处以身作则。某次战斗时，解放战士孙才小衣裳被雨淋湿，张傻子就把自己的衣裳被子给他换上盖上，使孙感动得说不出话来。行军到后半段，张又替小炮组拿七个炮弹还扛机枪。副班长耿勾巴的脚打的泡都溃了也不掉队，影响战士张楞小也坚持下来。班里自己能够解决的问题，都在班务会上解决。有一次行军走的太累的时候，战士张进福骂大街，到宿营地后，班长在班务会上进行善意的批评，会后又向战士们征求对自己在态度上有没有毛病。解放战士张楞小进入察南后，想着逃跑，但在正副班长及全班的积极帮助耐心教育下，已转变成为积极分子。现全班已有五个人立了小功。　　　　　　　 　（谷平）
