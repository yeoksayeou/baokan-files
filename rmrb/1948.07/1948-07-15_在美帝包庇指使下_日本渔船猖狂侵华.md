Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Comprehensive reports from various sources indicate that the fishing and aggressive activities of Japanese fishing boats in China's territorial waters are becoming increasingly rampant. According to Central News Agency dispatches: From May 19th to mid-June of this year, in less than a month, more than 20 Japanese fishing vessels were discovered in Chinese waters. The intrusion of Japanese fishing boats into Chinese territorial waters for fishing is a planned action by the Japanese authorities and is directly instigated by MacArthur. According to the Tianjin Yishibao: Crew members of the Japanese fishing vessels "Unzen Maru" No. 21 and No. 22, belonging to the Japanese "Kawaminami Fisheries Industry Co., Ltd.," which were fishing in Zhejiang waters on May 19th, confessed: "The fishing boats came to China under the orders of Kawaminami Co., Ltd., and will report the longitude, latitude, and measured seawater depth to the Japanese authorities every so often." Furthermore, on May 3rd, the Tianjin Xin Xing Daily translated and published an article from the Japanese press openly recounting the story of a Japanese fishing boat, the "Akashi Maru," crossing the border to fish a year earlier. The article wrote: "April 7, 1947, was the eve of our maiden voyage. Captain Ko-han presided over a gathering ceremony for all crew members. He announced that our ship would sail directly to China tomorrow, because the fishing work in that sea area has been permitted by headquarters (referring to MacArthur's headquarters)."

What is particularly noteworthy is that many of the Japanese fishing vessels that come to China for fishing are converted from Japanese naval ships. For example, the aforementioned Japanese fishing vessel "Akashi Maru" was repaired and converted from a small Japanese warship that was damaged during the war of aggression against China. The Xin Xing Daily translation stated: After a detailed inspection by American inspectors, they "believed that this was simply a gunboat, with thickened steel plates in the engine room, and the seven torpedo guns were considered military ordnance for combat," but MacArthur's headquarters "finally signed a permit" for the ship. Furthermore, according to a Central News Agency dispatch, the 25 crew members of the two Japanese fishing boats fishing in Zhejiang waters on May 19th stated: "The Japanese crew members are all wearing military uniforms, are skilled in military movements, and a commemorative badge was found on their bodies, with the words 'Japan-China Incident Commemoration 1937 Ishimatsu Team'. Unzen Maru No. 22 may have been converted from a gunboat." The Beiping News reported on May 26th: "In the future, this group of people can easily become the vanguard of a real-gun, real-knife landing."

The Jiang government, with the breath of MacArthur, does everything possible to cover up and give preferential treatment to the Japanese aggressors. The Beiping Xinmin Daily revealed: The Jiang government's policy towards Japanese fishing boats that intrude into our territorial waters is "only to confiscate their fishing gear, and the personnel are sent to MacArthur's headquarters for handling. What is the value of the fishing gear? Can it compensate for the loss of a country's sovereignty?" A Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on June 3rd even admitted: The Jiang government authorities adopt a so-called "lenient treatment" attitude towards Japanese fishing boats that violate Chinese sovereignty. In fact, in May 1946, the Jiang government and MacArthur reached an agreement to sell China's fishing rights to Japan, allowing 40 Japanese fishing boats to fish in the so-called "high seas" (the waters beyond three nautical miles from the coast are called "high seas", so it is actually the Chinese coast) between China and Japan for one year, which has already opened up a "legal" path for Japanese fishing boats to invade China.

Many signs indicate that Japan's aggression against China's fishing rights will intensify in the future. At the Shanghai "Japan Issues" symposium convened by the Shanghai Dagongbao on June 10th, Lu Yanghao of the Southeast Fisheries Company pointed out: "Before the war, Japanese fishing boats had squeezed the Chinese fishing industry to the point of suffocation." "MacArthur has recently allowed Japan to retain more than 150,000 tons of fishing boats and has ordered a fishing industry plan from 1948 to 1952, preparing to build another 2.7 million tons of motorized fishing boats. Won't so many ships all come to China to fish in the future?!"

### 在美帝包庇指使下　日本渔船猖狂侵华

　　在美帝包庇指使下
    日本渔船猖狂侵华
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合各方消息：日本渔船在中国领海的捕鱼侵略活动日益猖獗。据中央社电讯连续披露：从今年五月十九日至六月中旬不到一个月的时间中，在中国海面发现之日本渔轮即达二十余艘。日本渔船侵越中国领海捕鱼系日本当局有计划之行动，且为麦克阿瑟所直接指使。据天津益世报载：五月十九日在浙江海面捕鱼的属于日本“川南水产工业株式会社”之“云仙丸”第二十一号和第二十二号两日本渔轮船员供认：“渔轮来华系奉川南株式会社之命，每行若干时即将经纬度和所测海水深度报告日当局”。另五月三日天津新星报曾从日本报刊译载过一篇公开记述一年以前一只日本渔船“明石丸”号越界捕鱼故事的文章，该文写道：一九四七年“四月七日，是我们举行处女航的前夕，船长小藩先生主持了全体船员的集会典礼，他在席上宣布明天我们的船将直驶中国。因为该处海面的捕鱼工作已经得总部（指麦克阿瑟总部）的许可”。
    尤可注意者，来华捕鱼之日本渔轮不少且系日本海军舰只改装而成，例如上述日渔轮“明石丸”即系侵华战争期间被炸伤的一艘小型日本军舰修装而成的。新星报译文记载：美国检验官详细勘查之后亦“认为这简直是一艘炮舰，机关室加厚着钢板，七门鱼炮被认为是作战用的军械”，但麦克阿瑟总部对该船却“终于签署了许可证”。另据中央社电讯描述五月十九日在浙江海面捕鱼之两日本渔船二十五名船员称：“日船员均着军服，娴习军事动作，自彼等身上搜出一纪念章，有‘日支事变纪念一九三七石松队’字样，云仙丸第二十二号可能为炮艇所改装。”五月二十六日北平新闻报载文指出：“未来这批人正可以驾轻就熟，成为真枪真刀的登陆先锋。”
    蒋政府对于日人之侵略行动，则仰承麦克阿瑟鼻息，极尽包庇优容之能事。北平新民报揭露：蒋政府对侵入我领海的日本渔船，“只是没收它的渔具，人员则解送麦克阿瑟总部办理。渔具所值几何？是不是能抵偿一国主权的损失？”中央社上海六月三日电更承认：蒋政府当局对侵犯中国主权的日渔船皆采所谓“宽大待遇”的优容态度。事实上，一九四六年五月间蒋政府与麦克阿瑟成立协定，将中国渔权出卖给日本允许日本渔船四十艘在中日间所谓“公海”（海岸三海里以外即称“公海”，故实即中国沿海）捕渔一年，即已为日本渔船打开了“合法”侵华的路子。
    不少迹象表明日本对中国渔权之侵略，今后将会变本加厉。六月十日上海大公报召开之上海各界人士“日本问题”座谈会中，东南渔业公司陆养浩指出：“战前日本渔船曾把中国渔业压得透不过气来”。“麦帅最近更许日本保留渔轮十五万多顿，并订一九四八年至一九五二年渔业计划，准备再造二百七十万吨机器渔轮。那么多的船，将来还不是都开来中国捕鱼吗！？”
