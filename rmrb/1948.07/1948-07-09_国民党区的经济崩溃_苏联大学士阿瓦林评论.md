Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 6th: Soviet Academician Avarin published an article in the Soviet "New Times" magazine on April 7th this year, commenting on the economic collapse in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The article stated that the economic collapse in the Kuomintang-controlled areas serves as a tragic example of the consequences of pursuing American "aid." This economic collapse has now reached an unprecedented scale, and the disasters and poverty suffered by the people due to the collapse of the national economy are indescribable. Avarin cited numerous facts to point out that more than four billion US dollars in "aid" has only brought about a monthly increase in industrial recession, disruption of the transportation system, and deterioration of agriculture. Inflation is spiraling out of control; the only industry in Kuomintang China that is still operating at full capacity is printing banknotes. The aim of the American financial oligarchy is to save their expenses by paying the Kuomintang reactionaries at the lowest cost, hoping to build an American colonial rule over China on the ruins of China's national economy and the graves of hundreds of thousands of Chinese people. Rockefeller, Mellon, and other American financial giants are intensifying their strangulation of China's national economy. The Rockefeller Group has long controlled many important enterprises in Shanghai, including Chase Bank, Radio Corporation, and Shanghai Power Company. The commentary concluded by pointing out that the Chinese people have awakened and are yearning for a new life. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is liberating provinces and cities, cutting off the imperialist tentacles that are trying to devour their country. From the ashes, disasters, and struggles, a new anti-imperialist and democratic China is growing.

　　国民党区的经济崩溃
    苏联大学士阿瓦林评论
    【新华社陕北六日电】苏联大学士阿瓦林于今年四月七日苏联“新时代”杂志上撰文评论国民党统治区的经济崩溃。该文称：国民党统治区的经济崩溃是追求美国“援助”的悲惨后果的榜样。这个经济崩溃现在已达空前的规模，国家经济生活的崩溃所引起的人民的灾难与贫困是难以形容的。阿瓦林列宁各项事实指出：四十多亿美元的“援助”，只是逐月带来更甚的工业萎缩、运输系统的紊乱和农业的恶化。通货飞速地膨胀，在国民党中国唯一仍然在全力开动的工业就是印刷钞票。美国财政寡头的目的是节省他们的开支，以最低的代价付与国民党反动派，而希望在中国国民经济的废墟上和数十万中国人的坟墓上，建立起美国对中国的殖民地统治。洛克菲勒、梅隆及其他美国金融巨头正加紧绞杀中国的国民经济。洛克菲勒集团早已控制了上海许多重要企业，包括大通银行、无线电公司及上海电力公司。评论最后指出：但中国人民已经觉醒并响往新的生活，中国人民解放军正解放各省份各城市，斩掉力图吞噬他们国家的帝国主义触手；从灰烬、灾难和斗争中，一个反帝的民主新中国正生长起来。
