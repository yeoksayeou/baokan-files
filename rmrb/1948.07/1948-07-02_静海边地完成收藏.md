　　[Report from Central Hebei] The local armed forces and militia of Jinghai protected the wheat harvest, actively engaging and proactively striking against Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were seizing wheat. On June 2nd, our local armed forces and militia suddenly captured Taitou and Huangcha, and then captured the enemy stronghold of Balizhuang. From the 10th to the 15th, Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Chen Guantun and other places dispatched troops to seize wheat every day, and were killed or wounded more than a hundred times. Our local armed forces also took the initiative to advance into the enemy's rear, attacking strongholds such as Gaozhuangzi and Wulizhuang, destroying four watchtowers. The militia actively laid landmines to blockade the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, killing and wounding five Chiang Kai-shek bandits and one horse in villages such as Yuan Mengkou. Thanks to the active efforts of the local armed forces and militia in attacking the wheat-snatching enemy, more than 90% of the wheat in the border area of the county has been harvested and fortified.
