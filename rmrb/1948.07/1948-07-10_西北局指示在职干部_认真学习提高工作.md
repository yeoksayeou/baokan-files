Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th: The Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on "July 1st" regarding the study of on-the-job cadres, instructing Party committees at all levels to conscientiously organize on-the-job cadres to study and master Mao Zedong Thought, study the Party Central Committee's lines and policies, summarize work experience, and improve cadres' awareness and work quality. The aim is to resolutely eliminate blindness in work and certain serious undisciplined and anarchic malpractices, in order to adapt to the victorious development of the Liberation War nationwide. The instructions pointed out: "In the actual work of war, land reform, and production for disaster relief, it has been revealed that a considerable number of our cadres, and even some leading cadres, have a very low theoretical level, a poor grasp of policy, lack a sense of new things, and lack analysis and research on actual movements, simply and isolatedly implementing policies, with serious blindness, thus causing considerable losses in work." The instructions criticized the phenomenon of leading cadres neglecting the leadership of study, saying: "Even now, many leading comrades do not pay enough attention to leading and organizing the study of on-the-job cadres, fail to regularly pay attention to leading cadres' research on policies, summarizing work, and solving the ideological and work problems of their subordinate cadres, but rather emphasize what is less important and neglect what is more important, placing the most important leadership of study, namely ideological leadership, in a secondary and incidental position, pushing it to the支部 [zhī bù - branch] or general cadres, and becoming mired in the quagmire of事務主義 [shì wù zhǔ yì - bureaucraticism] from which they cannot extricate themselves." Therefore, the instructions require that "every leading comrade should regard leading and organizing cadres' study as their important responsibility, putting it in the first place of leadership work. Only in this way can they continuously improve cadres' awareness, solve the difficulties in leadership work, improve work quality, overcome the shortcomings of bureaucraticism, and make their work departments like a good clock, coordinated and accurate." Regarding the method of study, the instructions said: "Combining theory with practice is the only correct study policy. The erroneous phenomenon of neglecting theoretical study, not paying attention to reading Chairman Mao's works, not reading the Party's directives and documents, and not reading newspapers must be changed. All designated study documents must be read in detail to understand their spirit and essence. At the same time, the weapon of criticism and self-criticism must be used to examine ideology, work, and work style, and to prevent the tendency to deviate from reality." The instructions stipulate: According to the existing on-the-job cadres' cultural level, comprehension ability, and needs, study is divided into three categories: A. Cadres with general cultural level and work experience should focus on studying policies, with the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party rectification work in 1948, the two documents analyzing classes in 1933, and Comrade Ren Bishi's report on several issues in land reform as the center, in connection with the relevant documents of the Northwest Bureau. The study will be conducted by the leading cadres of each department. B. Senior cadres at or above the county level with considerable cultural level and rich work experience, in addition to studying relevant policy documents, should also study Chapter 2 of "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" and the foreword to the reprint by the Central Propaganda Department, refer to "Chairman Mao's Speech at the Conference of Cadres in Shanxi and Suiyuan" and "Lenin on How Soviet Workers Should Work", and the seven documents on party rectification mentioned in the foreword to the reprint of Chapter 2 of "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" by the Central Propaganda Department (namely, the Resolution of the Gutian Conference, Opposition to Liberalism, Rectification of the Style of Study, Party Work Style, and Literary Style, Decision to Strengthen Party Spirit, Decision on Centralized Leadership, New Party Constitution, Report on the Amendment of the Party Constitution). The study method is mainly self-study, supplemented by collective discussion. C. All cadres with too low a cultural level in various departments below the county level must be organized to study culture in addition to business and general current affairs policy education. The content should focus on Chinese, and courses such as arithmetic, history, geography, and nature should be selected according to work needs, and reading newspapers, writing diaries, and writing news reports should be encouraged. Cultural refresher schools should be opened as much as possible, either by one department alone, by several departments jointly, or by designating a special person to provide individual tutoring. In addition to winter training, district and township cadres should regularly read newspapers and study party member textbooks, and write diaries and news reports in connection with their work. Depending on the situation, classes, collective discussions, and individual assistance should be adopted." The instructions also stipulated that the study plan for the above documents should be completed within this year.

　　西北局指示在职干部
    认真学习提高工作
    【新华社西北八日电】中共中央西北局于“七一”发出关于在职干部学习的指示，责成各级党委认真负责组织在职干部，学习掌握毛泽东思想，学习党中央的路线、政策，总结工作经验、提高干部觉悟与工作质量，坚决消灭工作中的盲目性和某些严重的无纪律、无政府的不良现象，以适应解放战争在全国范围内胜利发展的形势。指示指出：“在战争、土改及生产救灾等实际工作中，暴露了我们有相当数量的干部甚至某些领导干部理论水平很低，政策观点很差，对新鲜事物缺乏感觉，对实际运动缺乏分析研究，简单孤立的执行政策，存在着严重的盲目性，因而造成工作中的不少损失。”指示批评领导干部忽视领导学习的现象说：“现在仍有不少领导同志，对领导与组织在职干部的学习极不重视，未能经常的注意领导干部研究政策，总结工作，解决其所属干部中的思想和工作问题，而是重其所轻，轻其所重，把最重要的学习领导即思想领导摆在次要的附带地位，推给支部或一般干部去作，陷自己于事务主义的泥坑不能自拔。”因此，指示要求“每个领导同志，应该把领导与组织干部学习当作自己的重要职责，把它放到领导工作的第一位，只有如此才能不断的提高干部觉悟，解决领导工作中的困难，提高工作质量，克服事务主义的毛病，使自己的工作部门象一个好时钟一样，合拍而且准确。”关于学习的方法，指示说：“理论与实际结合是唯一正确的学习方针，忽视理论学习、不注意阅读毛主席的著作、不看党的指示文件、不看报纸的错误现象必须改变。凡属指定的学习文件，尤须详细阅读，领会其精神实质，同时必须运用批评与自我批评的武器，检查思想、工作、作风，防止脱离实际的倾向。”指示规定：依现有在职干部的文化程度、理解能力与需要分为三类学习：甲、具有一般文化程度与工作经验的干部，应以学习政策为主，以中央关于一九四八年土改与整党工作的指示、一九三三年分析阶级的两个文件及任弼时同志关于土改中的几个问题的报告为中心，联系学习西北局的有关文件。学习的进行，由各部门领导干部负责。乙、具有相当文化程度与工作经验较丰富的县级以上高级干部，除学习有关政策的文件外，并应学习“左派幼稚病”第二章与中宣部的重印前言，参看“毛主席在晋绥干部会上的讲话”与“列宁论苏维埃工作人员应如何工作”、中宣部重印“左派幼稚病”第二章前言所说到的七个关于整党的文件（按为古田会议决议案，反对自由主义，整顿学风党风文风，增强党性决定，领导一元化决定，新党章，关于修改党章的报告）。学习方法以自修为主，配合集体讨论。丙、县以下各部门中一切文化水平太低的干部，除业务与一般时事政策教育外，必须组织学习文化，内容以国文为主，依工作需要选举算术、史地、自然等课，并提倡看报纸、写日记、写通讯。应尽可能开办文化补习学校，或一部门独办，或数部门合办，或指定专人个别补习。区乡干部除进行冬训外，应经常进行读报与学习党员课本，并联系写日记，写通讯。依情况采用上课，集体讨论与个别帮助。”该指示并规定上述文件学习计划应在今年内完成。
