Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: The Kuomintang's propaganda is confused and contradictory.

    It once admitted to the fact of American support for Japan, but now slanders the student patriotic movement according to its master's orders.

    Shortly before the Kuomintang Central Daily News, acting on the orders of its American masters, began constantly slandering and intimidating the student patriotic movement "Opposing American Support for Japan," it published an article entitled "How Does America Support Japan?" on May 14th. The article began with a special note: "America's unreserved support for Japan's recovery is not only a cause of anxiety and opposition for countries in the Far East, but also for many people in the United States who have expressed doubts. This article is a selective translation of reports from the recently published 'Newsweek' and 'World Report' regarding America's support for Japan. From these accounts, we can vaguely see a powerful Japan gradually taking shape, which is truly terrifying for the Chinese people!" When the Central Daily News, in its editorial on June 2nd, wantonly slandered patriotic students and people's opposition to American support for Japan as "hearsay" and "thoughtless," it forgot that only nineteen days earlier, its own newspaper had published such an article "recording the facts of American support for Japan." The article published by the Central Daily News not only exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' vain and shameless slander of the student patriotic movement, but also exposed the vain and shameless denials of American support for Japan by American Ambassador Stuart and the American Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, because "Newsweek" and "World Report" are both mouthpieces of Wall Street, but even they cannot deny the fact of American support for Japan. The article acknowledged the following facts: First, the United States wants to bring Japan's industry above pre-war levels. The article stated: "The Overseas Affairs Advisory Group led by Straker has drafted a comprehensive report stating that Japan's industry must be raised above pre-war levels in several respects. The Drapers agree with this argument. Taking shipping as an example, Straker's advisory group believes that Japan should have at least four million tons of merchant ships, and should also build 400,000 tons of new ships each year as a supplement; Japan should be allowed to retain 27 shipyards from Hakone in the north to Shimonoseki in the west, and the Maizuru Naval Shipyard should be reserved for ship repair." The Central Daily News specifically marked this in its sub-headline: "Who can guarantee that raising a tiger will not cause trouble?" Second, the United States is prepared to provide Japan with large loans, "According to precise estimates from Washington and Tokyo in recent weeks, the United States will use 1.5 billion US dollars to implement Japan's recovery plan. American officials try to avoid using the easily offensive name 'Japan Recovery Plan,' but the goal they are actually working towards is to support Japan and make it a stronghold in the Far East." Third, preserve the Japanese Zaibatsu organizations. "On May 1st, MacArthur announced that 194 companies had been removed from the list of 325 companies (referring to Zaibatsu companies that should be dispersed according to the 'Economic Decentralization Law'), and others will be gradually removed. They demanded to amend this method (referring to the 'Economic Decentralization Law') because they believed that industrial decentralization would undermine Japan's production." Fourth, reduce Japanese reparations and retain Japanese war industry. "In order to promote Japan's economic recovery, the reparations policy has been revised to some extent. The initial plan to transfer all military industries as reparations has now been greatly reduced. The work of dismantling Japanese factories has now largely stopped, and the American military strongly advocates retaining secondary military industries for 'peaceful production' under appropriate supervision... As a result, Japan has retained many light and heavy industries." Fifth, delay the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. "The undeclared state of peace will be extended indefinitely. Japan is currently enjoying preferential treatment that other defeated countries cannot enjoy during the armistice. With American support, Japan is striding towards recovery." "America's treatment of Japan is as if Japan had never been the main culprit in a war, and is still a defeated and occupied country." "The convening of a peace conference with Japan is nowhere in sight, and the United States is in no hurry to sign a peace treaty with Japan and give up the power it now exercises in Japan. On the contrary, she hopes to maintain the current informal state of peace in order to 'transform' Japan into a reliable ally in troubled Asia." The Central Daily News specifically pointed out in its sub-headline: This "delaying situation is extremely beneficial to Japan," "Under this ridiculous situation, Japan receives a series of benefits." The article finally admitted that the "main purpose" of all these American measures is to "regenerate Japan and make it stand up again."

　　国民党宣传上混乱矛盾
    曾招认美国扶日事实
    依照其主子命令又诬蔑学生爱国运动
    【新华社陕北七日电】国民党中央日报在这次依照其美国主子命令，以不断的诬蔑、恫吓来反对学生“反对美国扶日”的爱国运动前不久即五月十四日，会刊载一篇题为“美国怎样扶植日本？”的文章，文首并特别注明了：“美国不遗余力支助日本复兴，不仅为远东国家所焦虑与反对，即美国也有不少人表示怀疑的态度。本文是根据纽约最近出版的“新闻周刊”与“世界报告周刊”所载关于美国如何扶植日本的情形择要移译而成。从这些记述里，我们隐约可以看出一个强大的日本正在逐渐形成，对于中国人民真不胜惧栗之至！”当中央日报在其六月二日社论中，大肆诬蔑爱国的学生和人民反对美国扶日为“道听途说”和“不加思索”的时候，却忘记了仅仅在十九天之前，自己的报纸上就曾发表过这样一篇“记述美国扶植日本”的事实的文章。中央日报所载的这篇文章不但戳穿了国民党反动派诬蔑学生爱国运动的虚妄与无耻。而且同样戳穿了美国大使司徒雷登和美驻上海总领事卡波特否认美国扶日的虚妄与无耻，因为“新闻周刊”与“世界报告周刊”都是华尔街的喉舌，但它们也不能否认美国扶植日本的事实。该文承认下列各项事实：第一，美国要使日本工业超过战前水平。该文称：“斯揣克领导的海外事务咨询团曾拟定一个综合报告书，说明日本的工业在若干方面都必须提高到超过战前的水平。德雷柏们同意这种论调。以航业为例，斯揣克的咨询团相信日本至少应有四百万吨商船，并且每年尚应制造新船四十万吨以为补充；日本应获准保有北起箱根西迄下关的造船厂二十七所，舞鹤海军造船厂应保留专供修船之用”。中央日报对此特别在其小标题中标明：“谁能担保养虎不贻患？”第二，美国准备给日本以大量贷款，“依据华盛顿和东京方面数星期以来的精确估计，美国将以十五亿美元作为实施日本复兴计划之用。美国官方尽量避免采用“日本复兴计划”这一容易招致反感的名称，但他们实际上所努力的目标，却正是把日本扶植起来，使之成为远东的堡垒”。第三，保存日本财阀组织。“五月一日麦帅宣布，在三百廿五家公司（指按照“经济分散法”应予分散的财阀公司）名单中剔除一百九十四家，其他亦将陆续删除。他们之所以要求修改这种办法（指“经济分散法”），是因为他们认为工业分散足以打击日本的生产”。第四，减低日本赔偿，保留日本战争工业。“为促成日本经济复员故，赔偿政策已作若干修正。最初计划迁移全部军需工业作为赔偿，现在已打了很大的折扣。拆卸日本工厂的工作现已在大半停顿，美国军部力主保留次要的军需工业，在适当监督之下改作“和平生产”之用，……这一来日本保留下不少轻重工业。”第五，拖延对日和约的签订。“未经明白宣布的和平状态将无限期延长。日本刻正享受其他战败国在休战期间不能享受的优待。在美国扶植之下，日本正大步走向复兴之路。”“美国之对待日本，全未当日本曾经是一个战争的祸首，和现在尚是一个战败而被占领的国家。”“对日和会的召开乃遥遥无期，美国亦并不急于签订对日和约，放弃她现在日本行使的权力。相反地，她希望维持目前的非正式和平状态，以便“改造”日本成为她在多事的亚洲的可靠的友邦。”中央日报并特别在其小标题中指明：这种“拖的局面极有利于日本”，“在这种滑稽局面下，日本受到一连串好处”。该文最后承认：美国这一切措施的“主要目的，是使日本再生，重新站立起来”。
