[Ji-Lu-Yu News] With the imminent arrival of the Yellow River flood season, the Yellow River Committee has recently made emergency arrangements for flood prevention work. It was pointed out that the general spirit of this year's flood prevention is to defend key areas in phases and sections, overcoming last year's general formalism. Flood prevention must be closely integrated with production to ensure a reasonable labor burden. Each county and section must achieve unified leadership and joint responsibility. The county head must take the lead personally and not relax for a moment, to effectively complete the important task of ensuring that the Yellow River embankment does not breach. The county head and section chief of the area where negligence occurs and an accident happens will bear full responsibility. Regarding the organization of flood prevention, it is stipulated that county and district levels will set up command headquarters, and a key command point will be set up every ten li in key sections, with adjustments made as appropriate depending on special circumstances. Each key point will have a warning bell. A flood prevention hut will be set up every 500 meters in key sections, and a flood prevention hut will be set up every 1,000 meters in ordinary work sections. Each hut will be equipped with a copper gong and fifteen kinds of tools and materials for emergency rescue and embankment protection. Usually, each hut will have a flood prevention worker, with shifts changing once a month. When the water reaches about one meter from the embankment, the number of workers will increase to seven, and when the water rises further, it will increase to ten, with shifts changing about every five days. Villages within ten li of the river will be flood prevention areas. Villages within five li will mainly use self-defense forces to organize emergency rescue and embankment protection teams. Team members will usually engage in production at home, but they must prepare tools and materials for emergency rescue, such as grass bundles, cloth bags, hoes, and baskets. In case of danger, a bell or gong will be used as a warning signal. When the gong is sounded, the rescue teams within five li of the river must immediately go to the embankment for rescue and protection, and when the bell is sounded, all able-bodied men within ten li must immediately go to the embankment for rescue and protection.

　　黄河大汛即将到来我黄委会紧急布防
    【冀鲁豫讯】黄河大汛即将到来，我黄委会于日前紧急布置防汛工作。指出今年防汛，总的精神是分期分段，重点防守，克服去年一般化的形式主义作法。防汛要和生产密切结合起来，确实做到劳力负担的合理。各县和段必须做到领导统一、共同负责。县长要亲自带头，一时一刻也不能放松，切实完成确保临黄不准开口的重大任务。何处疏忽失事，何处的县长、段长要负完全责任。关于防汛的组织，规定县、区级设指挥部，重点段每十华里设一重点指挥点，特殊情形可酌情增减，每个重点设一警钟。重点段每五百公尺设一防汛屋，平工段每千公尺设一防汛屋。每屋备铜锣一面，和十五种抢险护堤的工具工料。平时每屋设一防汛员，每月换班一次。水至大堤一公尺左右时增至七人，水再大时，增至十人，五天左右换班一次。沿河十里内的村庄为防汛区。五里内的村庄以自卫队为主，组织抢险护堤队。队员平时在家生产，但须准备好抢险的草捆、布袋、铣、筐等工具工料。出险时以敲钟鸣锣为警号，敲锣时沿河五里内的抢护队立即上堤抢护，敲钟时十里内的壮丁都要立即上堤抢护。
