　　Overcoming Empty Return Trips and Arbitrary Mobilization Phenomena
　　Jin-Sui Military Station Saves Civilian Labor
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 22nd】 During the arduous task of supporting the front lines, the Jin-Sui Border Region Military Station makes every effort to reduce the burden on the masses and strengthen production. A system of mutual assistance and freight forwarding has been established between the military transport system and the government's finance department and the industrial and commercial bureau's transportation department, reducing the waste of transport capacity caused by empty return trips and improving transport efficiency. Strengthening education on mass discipline for transport personnel, with unified management and command by local military stations upon arrival at any location, has greatly reduced violations of mass discipline. Visiting wounded soldiers, sick personnel, cadres, and military personnel are also uniformly received and transferred by the military station, overcoming the past phenomenon of visiting personnel arbitrarily mobilizing the labor of the masses, animal power, and food. Between Xing County and Lin County, a distance of 160 li, this has saved the manpower of six reception stations for the masses, as well as the monthly consumption of wages, oil, salt, firewood, and rice. The military station also constantly checks the stretchers and livestock needed by visiting personnel. Under conditions that do not hinder health, those sitting on stretchers are persuaded to ride livestock, and those riding livestock are persuaded to walk. In March alone, the general military station reception station saved ten stretchers and one hundred and twenty man-days.

　　克服回头放空脚及随意动员现象
  　晋绥兵站节约民力
    【新华社晋绥二十二日电】晋绥边区兵站在艰巨的支前军勤任务中，尽量设法减轻群众负担，加强生产。军运系统与政府财政处、工商局运输部门间，都建立了相互帮助、代运物资的制度，减少了回头放空脚浪费运输力的现象，并提高了运输效率。对运输员加强群要纪律教育，每到一地受当地兵站统一管理指挥，大大减少了违犯群众纪律的现象。各地过往伤病员和干部军人亦由兵站统一招待转送，克服过去过往人员随意动员群众人力畜力和吃饭等现象。从兴县到临县一百六十里间，因此节省群众六个招待所人员的人力，每月工资及其他油、盐、柴、米的消耗。兵站并随时检查过往人员所需之担架和牲口。在不妨碍健康的条件下，说服坐担架的改骑牲口，骑牲口的步行。仅总兵站招待所三月份即因而节省十付担架，一百二十个人工。
