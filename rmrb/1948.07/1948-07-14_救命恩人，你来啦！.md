　　“Savior, you've come!”
    “Wheat, wheat, grow slowly, wait for the life-saving troops to come before you turn yellow!” This folk song expresses the feelings of the people of Jinzhong, who feared that Yan's troops would steal their wheat and eagerly awaited the arrival of the People's Liberation Army to protect it. Now, our army has penetrated deep into Jinzhong to fight, and in every village we pass or are stationed in, groups of men, women, and children surround our soldiers, weeping and recounting the atrocities of Yan's bandits. When the masses of Changze Village in Pingyao stopped our army, they began by saying, "Savior, you've come!" and then choked up, unable to speak. An old woman hugged Wang Dingguo, the commander of a certain regiment of our army, and cried loudly, "Child, I recognize you. You led troops here last year. You have finally come back!" In a certain village, an old woman heard someone knocking on the door in the middle of the night and thought it was the "Gouzi Army" (as the people of Jinzhong called Yan's bandits), so she ignored it. The next day, when she opened the door, she saw PLA soldiers sleeping outside her door, and she couldn't help but burst into tears.

    Since Yan's bandits reoccupied Wenxi, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, and Pingyao last spring, the local people have been subjected to slaughter and endless plunder, resulting in ruined families, separated wives and children, and abandoned fields. The once-rich Jinzhong plain has been transformed into a living hell.

    Changze Village in Pingyao has 105 households, a population of over 680, and 3,400 mu of land. Last year, they only harvested 680 shi of various grains, equivalent to 1,326 shi of mixed grains. Who knew that these few grains would become the source of disaster? After the wheat harvest last year, Yan's bandits began to "levy" grain. In October, 50 villagers were forced to flee due to unbearable oppression. Yan's bandits burned down more than 40 houses of the fleeing households to threaten the farmers. Then, they came to "levy" grain again and again, beating, binding, and dispatching police teams to search every household, digging cellars, overturning chests and cabinets, and openly plundering. On one occasion, the bandits slammed a large guillotine on the table and said, "Whoever doesn't hand over grain will see this!" On another occasion, they stripped the clothes off the peasants who could not hand over the grain and froze them to death. From August of last year to March of this year, the village was forced to provide grain under dozens of names, including "regular grain," "provincial public grain," "county public grain," "military purchase grain," "village grain," "food ration grain," "grain for comforting wounded soldiers," "cooperative shareholding grain," "militia training grain," "construction project grain," as well as grain demanded privately by the puppet township chiefs and captains to redeem captured villagers, totaling 1,043.5 shi of coarse grain, accounting for six-fifths of the village's total annual harvest. This spring, the people of the village generally filled their stomachs with wild vegetables, bran, and tree bark. Farmers Zhao Juhai, Wen Ying, Wen Qinyuan, and others starved to death.

    The people of Jinzhong not only went hungry but also suffered the massacre by Yan's bandits. Last winter, Yan's bandits gathered local despots and hooligans for "three self-training" (self-examination, self-defense, self-governance), requiring each person to "suddenly report" (meaning secretly report) three "camouflage elements" (a false accusation against those who opposed Yan's bandits' tyranny), and then arrested people on a large scale based on the list. On the evening of December 2nd, over 700 people were arrested in Pingyao County alone. On the 3rd, they were distributed to various villages and executed. In Xiang Le Town alone, more than 30 people were killed. At the same time, Yan's bandits launched a so-called "self-confession and rebirth movement" in various villages, forcing every villager to "confess" "their relationship with the Eighth Route Army." Those who did not "confess" were not released. Yan's bandits used the following brutal and absurd scenes to intimidate the people: coffins and clubs were placed on the field, and slogans of "beat to death with乱棍" were posted everywhere. Everyone was required to cry and slap themselves in the face with their own hands. Yan's bandits asked, "Have you been reborn?" The answer had to be, "I have been reborn." They asked, "How old are you?" The answer had to be, "One year old." If the masses did not hit themselves or cry, Yan's bandits would grab them, put them in coffins, and beat them severely. Finally, they threatened the masses, saying that if they approached the Eighth Route Army again, they would be "beaten to death with乱棍." In Taoyuan Fort, Pingyao, a widow was forced to "confess" that she had boiled water for the Liberation Army. Yan's bandits then forced her whole family to pronounce her guilty of death, then hanged her, and announced, "This is what her family all agree she deserves!"

    Many masses who had been subjected to torture told these tragic stories while taking off their clothes to show the soldiers their scars, and the soldiers and civilians were filled with grief and indignation. The troops immediately composed a song: "Yan's bandits kill without blinking an eye, self-confession and rebirth are cruel, on the small ground of Pingyao, seven hundred and three were killed in one night." The masses who heard it quietly shed tears. Inspired by the people's tragic experience, the soldiers wrote to their leaders one after another, requesting to be given the main attack task, to eliminate Yan's bandits as soon as possible, and to avenge the people of Jinzhong.

### “救命恩人，你来啦！”

　　“救命恩人，你来啦！”
    “麦子，麦子，你慢慢长，救命的队伍来了你再黄!”这首歌谣，是晋中人民害怕阎匪抢麦，热盼解放军前往护麦的心情的流露。现在，我军已深入晋中作战，路过或驻宿每一个村庄，成群的男女老少都围住战士们哭诉阎匪暴行。平遥长则村群众拦住我军刚开口说：“救命恩人，你来啦！”以后便哽咽不能成声。一位老太太抱住我军某营长王定国同志号啕大哭的说：“孩儿，我认识你，你去年带队伍住过这里，你们到底回来啦！”某村一位老太太半夜听见有人叫门，以为是“勾子军”（晋中人民以此称呼阎匪），她不理睬；第二天开门一看，解放军战士睡在她的门外，她情不自禁地痛哭起来。
    自去春阎匪再度侵踞文水、汾阳、孝义、平遥一带后，当地人民便在屠杀和无止境的掠夺下，家败人亡，妻离子散，田园荒芜，富足的晋中平川，变成了人间地狱。
    平遥长则村有一百零五户，人口六百八十余，土地三千四百亩，去年只打了各种粮六百八十石，折合杂粮一千三百二十六石。谁知这几颗粮食竟成了祸根。去年麦收后，阎匪便开始“征”粮，十月间，五十户村民因不堪压榨被迫逃亡，阎匪竟将逃亡户的房子烧毁了四十多间，以此威胁农民。接着便一次又一次的来“征”粮吊打捆绑并派保警队挨户搜查，掘地窖，翻箱柜，进行公开的抢掠。有一次，匪徒们拿了一把大铡刀在桌上一拍说：“谁不交，就看这个！”另一次，则将交不出粮的老百姓剥光了衣服活活冻死。从去年八月到今年三月该村被迫出粮的名目有“正粮”、“省公粮”、“县公粮”、“军购粮”、“乡村粮”、“派饭粮”、“慰劳伤兵粮”、“合作社入股粮”、“民卫军整训粮”、“修工事粮”及伪乡长队长私人要粮和赎回被抓村民粮等几十种，折合粗粮一千零四十三石五斗，占该村农民全年收获物的六分之五。今春该村人民普遍以野菜、糠秕和树皮充饥，农民赵巨孩、温英、温钦元等都活活饿死。
    晋中人民不仅挨饿，更惨遭阎匪的屠杀，去年冬季，阎匪集训恶霸流氓分子进行“三自传训”（自清、自卫、自治），要每人（突击）（密报之意）三个“伪装分子”（对反对阎匪暴政者的诬称），然后根据名单大肆捕人，十二月二日晚，平遥一县逮捕了七百多人，三日分发到各村处死，仅香乐镇殉难人民即达三十余人。与此同时，阎匪更在各村举行所谓“自白转生运动”，强迫每个村民“自白”“和八路军的关系”。不“自白”就不放回去。阎匪以下面这些残暴荒诞的场面来慑服人民：场上摆了棺材和棍棒，到处贴着“乱棍打死”的标语。要每个人哭着用自己的手打自己的耳光，阎匪问：“转生没有？”必须答：“转生了。”又问：“几岁了？”必答：“一岁了。”如果群众不打不哭，阎匪就抓过去放在棺材里痛打。最后并威胁群众说，以后再接近八路军，就“乱棍打死”。平遥桃园堡一个寡妇被迫“自白”了曾给解放军烧过开水，阎匪于是强迫她全家给她定为死罪，然后绞死；并宣传说：“这是她一家人公认该杀的！”
    许多曾遭酷刑的群众一边诉说这些悲痛的故事，一面脱了衣服把伤痕给战士们看，军民悲愤交集。部队上当场就编了一首歌：“阎贼杀人不眨眼，自白转生闹得惨，平遥一块小地面，一夜杀了七百三”。听到的群众悄悄流下了眼泪。为人民的惨痛经历所激动的战士们纷纷上书首长，要求给予主攻任务，早日消灭阎匪，为晋中人民复仇。
