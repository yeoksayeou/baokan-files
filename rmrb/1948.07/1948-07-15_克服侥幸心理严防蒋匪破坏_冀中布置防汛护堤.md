Jizhong News: With the rainy season approaching and the flood season imminent, the Jizhong Administrative Office convened a flood prevention meeting on June 13th to review last year's flood prevention work and study future flood prevention measures. Director Hao of the Public Works Bureau gave a report at the meeting, pointing out that last year, in addition to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breaching the dikes of the Daqing River and the Grand Canal to create floods, no other rivers breached. Cadres and the masses worked day and night to intensify flood prevention. Commissioners of the eighth, ninth, and tenth districts and county magistrates of Raoyang and other counties personally went to the dikes to inspect and check, leading the flood prevention work. The county magistrate of Jiaocheng County, the county party committee personally went into the water, leading the workers to rush to plug the breach in the Grand Canal overnight. Strong cadres were assigned to all flood prevention command organizations. Flood prevention preparations were also relatively thorough and serious. Generally, work such as signing tests, finding water seepage points, blocking road openings, repairing defects, and building earth levees was carried out. In the marginal areas, armed forces actively operated to protect the dikes and foiled the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' conspiracy to breach the dikes and release water on a large scale. There were still many shortcomings in last year's flood prevention work, such as the publicity work was not widespread and in-depth enough, and many people did not realize the importance of flood prevention, and thus failed to consciously defend; the permanent flood workers were not all in place until the end of July; the work of the permanent flood workers during the defense period lacked organized arrangements, supervision, and inspection; and the integration of flood prevention and production was also very poor. Because there were no major floods last year, some cadres developed a sense of complacency. If this sense of complacency is not completely eliminated, it will affect this year's flood prevention work and even suffer unnecessary losses. He said: This year, after the land reform, the crops are better than last year. The Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits are constantly plotting to breach the dikes and release water, and the hidden reactionaries in the interior may also carry out various sabotage activities. In order to protect the interests of the people, we must never paralyze ourselves with last year's situation. In certain areas and at certain times, flood prevention work should become the most important work. This year, the dikes of the rivers in the central area have not undergone major projects, so we must make strong defenses during the flood season. Due to the disturbance of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, some river works in the marginal areas have not been repaired at all or have not been repaired well. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been constantly breaching the dikes and releasing water. In places such as Mazhuang in Qing County, they closed the Jiuxuan Sluice of the Grand Canal and built dams across the river in an attempt to flood our upstream villages. In the Yibao area of Jinghai, they breached the Ziya River fort and closed the Babao (Jinghai) Sluice, plotting to flood the Maikouwa and Taifengwa areas. These all show that this year's flood prevention work, in addition to fighting against nature, must also fight against the floods created by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Therefore, all localities must mobilize the masses and actively carry out flood prevention work. The main thing is to mobilize cadres and the masses to jointly defend, and strictly enforce organization and discipline, emphasize responsibility at each level, and hold those who neglect flood prevention and cause disasters accountable. During the flood season, upstream and downstream, left bank and right bank are most likely to have conflicts of interest. We must educate the masses to proceed from the overall situation, with small interests subordinate to large interests, immediate interests subordinate to long-term interests, and partial interests subordinate to the whole. We must correct departmentalism and minimize the disaster area as much as possible. For the convenience of command, a flood prevention headquarters will be set up for each river system to be responsible for leading the flood prevention work of the river system; a county flood prevention headquarters and office will be set up below, and a village will organize a rescue team. During the defense period, we must organize the flood workers and dike patrolmen well, constantly carry out signing tests, inspections, earthwork reinforcement, and repair tools at any time. While not affecting the defense work, we must also organize flood workers to produce themselves and the masses to produce. In the future, we must carry out the flood prevention and field protection campaign, regularly evaluate merits, record merits, and reward those who actively defend and criticize or punish those who neglect defense.

Jizhong News: After the closing of the Jizhong flood prevention meeting, the eighth district convened a flood prevention meeting on the 26th to study the instructions of the Jizhong flood prevention meeting. It was proposed that the marginal areas should focus on armed dike protection, carry out political offensive, expose the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in destroying the dikes, and mobilize the masses to arm themselves for flood prevention. It was also decided to establish flood prevention headquarters in the Ziya River, the Grand Canal, and the Daqing River, with offices set up in each district along the river, and five to six dike patrol posts set up below. In addition to the local armed forces being equipped for dike protection, a large number of militiamen were also organized to prepare for armed dike protection.

　　克服侥幸心理严防蒋匪破坏
    冀中布置防汛护堤
    【冀中讯】雨季将到，伏汛即来，冀中行署特于六月十三日召开防汛会议，检讨去年防汛工作，研究今后防汛办法。工务局郝局长在会上作了报告，指出：去年除蒋匪在大清河、运河决堤制造水灾外，其他各河都没决口干部群众曾日夜加紧防汛、八、九、十等区专员及饶阳等县县长，亲自上堤巡视检查，领导防汛工作。交河县长，县委亲自下水，领导民工星夜抢堵运河决口。各防汛指挥机构中，都配备了坚强干部。防汛准备也较确实认真，一般的均进行了签试、水眼、填堵道口、修补残缺、增筑土牛等工作。在边缘地区，武装积极活动，保护堤防，粉碎了蒋匪大举决堤放水的阴谋。在去年防汛工作上，仍有不少缺点，如宣传工作不够普遍深入，不少群众没认识到防汛的重要，因而未能自觉的防守；常备汛工直到七月底还没上齐；对常备汛工防守期间的工作，缺乏有组织的布置、督促与检查；防汛与生产结合也很差。由于去年未发大水，某些干部发生了侥幸心理，这种侥幸心理如不彻底去掉，将影响今年的防汛工作，甚至遭到不应有的损失。他说：今年土改后，庄稼比去年好，蒋傅匪时刻阴谋扒堤放水，内地潜藏的反动分子也可能进行各种破坏。为保护人民利益，绝不能拿去年情况麻痹自己。在一定地区，一定时间，防汛工作应成为第一件重要工作。今年中心区各河堤防都未做大的工程，因此必须在汛期做有力的防守。边缘区河工因蒋匪扰乱，有的根本未修或修的不好。蒋匪不断决堤放水，在青县马庄等地，关闭了运河的九宣闸，并拦河打坝，企图泛滥我上游村庄。在静海一堡一带扒开子牙河堡、关闭八堡（静海）闸，阴谋水淹买口洼、台凤洼等地。这些都说明今年的防汛工作，除与自然斗争外，还要与蒋匪制造的泛滥作斗争。因此，各地必须发动群众，积极进行防汛工作。主要的还是发动干部、群众共同防守，并严格组织性、纪律性、强调逐级负责，对因忽视防汛发生灾害者，要追究责任。防汛期间，上游与下游，左岸与右岸最易发生利害矛盾，必须教育群众，从整体出发，小利服从大利，目前利益服从长远利益，局部服从全体。要纠正本位主义思想，尽量缩小受灾面积。为便于指挥，各河系设防汛期指挥部，负责领导本河系的防汛工作；下设县防汛指挥部、办事处，村组织抢险队。防守期间，要很好把汛工及巡堤员组织起来，不断的进行签试、检查、、培土牛等工作，并随时修理工具。在不影响防守工作下，还要组织汛工自己生产及群众生产，今后要开展防汛保田立功运动，定期评功、记功，对积极防守者予以奖励，对疏忽防守者予以批评或处分。
    【又讯】冀中防汛会议闭幕后，八分区于二十六日召开防汛会议，研究冀中防汛会议上的指示。提出：边缘区应以武装护堤为主，开展政攻，揭露蒋匪破坏堤防罪行，发动群众武装防汛。并决定在子牙河、运河、大清河建立防汛指挥部，沿河各区设办事处，下设五个至六个看堤巡铺。除地方武装配备护堤外，并组织了大批民兵准备武装护堤。
