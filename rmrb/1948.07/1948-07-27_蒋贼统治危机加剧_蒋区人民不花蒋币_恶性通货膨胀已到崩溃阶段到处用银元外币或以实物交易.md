Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st – Comprehensive reports from various sources indicate that due to the intensifying ruling crisis of Chiang Kai-shek and hyperinflation, the Chiang-issued “legal tender” is increasingly losing credibility among the people. The phenomenon of people in Chiang-controlled areas refusing to use Chiang currency has spread from the vast rural areas to major cities since this spring. Chiang currency is increasingly being replaced by silver dollars, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, which have relatively fixed value or credibility. The phenomenon of rejecting Chiang currency and engaging in barter trade in rural areas is also becoming increasingly common. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on June 27th, the buying and selling of silver dollars has been prevalent in Nanjing, the capital of Chiang Kai-shek's government, for three months, especially recently. The Central News Agency also admitted: "Nanjing merchants have openly set up stalls to buy silver dollars at high prices" (Central News Agency, Nanjing, June 21st). In Peiping (now Beijing), according to the aforementioned newspaper on June 1st, since Chiang Kai-shek announced the adoption of "legal tender" in 1935, silver dollars, which had been "retired" for more than ten years, have now "resumed their official duties, performing the work of exchange media." Everywhere you can see "people carrying silver dollars" and hear "the sound of silver dollars." "Silver dollars buried in the ground and hidden in the walls are pouring out." Xiaoshi in Deshengmen, Mashi Bridge in Fuchengmen, Xiaoshi in Xuanwumen, Xiaoshi in Andingmen, Xiaoshi in Dongdan Market, and Wupailou outside Qianmen have now become famous silver dollar markets in Peiping. In addition, peddlers who buy cameras, antique shops, and jewelry stores also engage in silver dollar transactions. As soon as people get Chiang currency, they quickly exchange it for silver dollars to avoid being deprived in the face of soaring prices. Besides Peiping, the buying and selling of silver dollars is becoming increasingly common in cities such as Qingdao, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, and Taiyuan. As for inland cities, silver dollars are already directly in circulation. According to a report by the Tianjin Yishibao's traveling reporter on June 27th: From Anqing via Wuhan, Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, to Liuzhou, "silver dollars have replaced legal tender and circulate without hindrance" all the way. Whether it is a restaurant, a gold store, or a hotel, everywhere you hear "the crisp sound of silver dollars." In addition to buying and selling "ordinary silver coins," deposits, gifts, and gatherings are generally made in "silver dollar units," and interest is also "calculated in silver dollars." In some areas, such as Changsha, Hengyang, and Xiangtan, "legal tender" has "almost completely retreated to the status of 'subsidiary currency.'"

In major cities, the price of silver dollars rises along with the prices of goods and foreign exchange rates. On the 25th and 26th of last month, each silver dollar could be exchanged for 2.25 million Chiang currency in Qingdao, 2.6 million in Nanjing, and 2.7 million in Taiyuan. The exchange rate between silver dollars and US dollars is approximately one dollar for seven or eight jiao. In Hunan cities, the exchange rate between silver dollars and Hong Kong dollars is approximately one to three.

In the rural areas of Chiang-controlled areas, the phenomenon of people refusing to use Chiang currency has long been widespread. Yu Hongjun, the president of Chiang's Central Bank, also had to admit that as a result of the widespread spontaneous use of silver coins by the people, a serious phenomenon of "paper money (referring to Chiang currency) concentrating in cities" has been created (according to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on June 19th). According to a report in the Shanghai Economic Weekly on April 29th, citing Xinmin Bao news: The Chiang authorities planned to build a 500-kilometer-long Milening (from Mile to Ninglang) highway in Yunnan. Because the local area uses "silver dollars as the unit and legal tender does not work," Chiang's Yunnan Provincial Government has been forced to allocate 200,000 silver dollars for construction costs. According to a report in the Shanghai Economic Weekly on September 25th of last year: As early as the autumn of last year, rural areas in Jiangnan had generally used specific objects as price calculation units instead of Chiang currency. The most common was rice, and in yarn-producing areas, it was yarn. All loans, operations, and payments were calculated in yarn or rice, and Chiang currency was only used for sporadic payments or when both parties agreed.

In Shanghai and Guangzhou, the international trade centers of China, the market has gradually excluded Chiang currency and switched to using the more stable US dollars and Hong Kong dollars as the standard for calculating commodity prices. In Shanghai, initially only renting houses and leasing shops were directly calculated in gold bars and US dollars, but since this spring, "some retailers have also started asking for US dollars" (according to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on May 27th). By the end of last month, when the economic storm in June reached its peak, Shanghai stores sold goods "demanding US dollars whenever possible" (according to an Associated Press report on June 25th). In Guangzhou, according to a report in the Shanghai Economic Weekly on April 29th, citing the Dagong Bao: Since the price increase in April, most of the units of account for all transactions have been Hong Kong dollars. Guangzhou newspapers also report commercial conditions in Hong Kong dollars. All imported and non-imported goods are priced in Hong Kong dollars, and then the selling price in Chiang currency is calculated based on the current price of Hong Kong dollars. The report also stated: "Not only in Guangzhou, but even in county towns and villages, Western paper (i.e., Hong Kong dollars) is universally accepted. Corrupt officials naturally use Western paper as the unit for discussing cases, and robbers and bandits also use Western paper as the unit for kidnapping and extortion."

The increasingly significant loss of credibility of Chiang currency marks a new stage in Chiang Kai-shek's inflation crisis—the beginning of the complete collapse stage of currency. It also marks the further monopolization of the economic lifeline of Chiang-controlled areas by American and British imperialism through the deep circulation of US dollars and Hong Kong dollars in China. Because the rural areas of Chiang-controlled areas have universally established "bastions to prevent the intrusion of legal tender" (Shanghai Economic Weekly), returning to barter trade or automatically switching to silver dollars; in cities, not only is the role of Chiang currency as a price standard and means of payment disappearing, but its last function, that is, its role as a means of circulation, is also increasingly being replaced by silver dollars and US dollars and Hong Kong dollars. As a result, "the scope of legal tender circulation has been greatly reduced" (ibid.); on the other hand, because of the prevalence of gold, US dollar, and Hong Kong dollar trading, people are unwilling to store Chiang currency and are competing to dump Chiang currency, which greatly increases the speed of Chiang currency circulation, and prices calculated in Chiang currency rise even faster. Both of these aspects are promoting the more rapid collapse of Chiang currency's credibility.

　　蒋贼统治危机加剧
  　蒋区人民不花蒋币
  　恶性通货膨胀已到崩溃阶段到处用银元外币或以实物交易
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合各方消息：由于蒋介石统治危机与恶性通货膨胀的加剧，蒋记“法币”在人民中已日益失去信用。蒋区人民拒用蒋币的现象，自今春以来，已由广大农村扩展至各大城市。蒋币已日益被较有固定价值或信用的银元、美钞、港币所代替，而农村中排拒蒋币，进行物物交换的现象也日见普遍。据天津益世报六月二十七日披露：蒋介石政府首都南京，三个月以来，已盛行银元的买卖，尤以最近为烈。中央社亦承认：“南京商人已公开设摊高价收买银元”（该社南京六月二十一日电）。在北平，据前引报纸六月一日载：从民国二十四年蒋介石宣布改用“法币”起“退位”了十几年的银元，现又“官复旧职，执行它交换媒介的工作”，到处可以看到“带银元的人”和听到“银元的声音”。“埋在地里和藏在墙里的银元都涌出来”了。德胜门晓市、阜城门里的马市桥、宣武门小市、安定门小市、东单市场小市及前门外五牌楼等处，现在都成了北平著名的银元市场。此外，如收买照相机的小贩、古玩店、金珠店等也都经营银元交易。人们一拿到蒋币，就赶快把它换成银元，以避免在物价飞涨中被剥夺。除了北平以外，青岛、徐州、开封、太原等城市，银元的买卖均日见普遍。至于内地各城市，银元则已直接通行。据六月二十七日天津益世报所登载之该报旅行记者通讯报导：从安庆经武汉、长沙、衡阳、桂林，到柳州，一路上“银元已代替法币而通行无阻”。无论饭店、金店或旅社，在在都闻“银元的清脆响声”，除买卖“普通用银币”之外，普遍存放款、送礼和集会，也完全用“银元作单位”，而利息也随着“按银元计算”；在若干地区，如长沙、衡阳、湘潭一带，“法币”且“几乎已完全退至‘辅币’的地位”。
    在各大城市中，银元均随着物价、外汇的上涨而上涨，上月二十五及二十六两日，每个银元在青岛可兑蒋币二百二十五万元，在南京是二百六十万元，在太原是二百七十万元。银元与美钞之间，大约维持着一元七、八角合一美元的比值。而在湖南各城市，银元与港币大约维持着一与三之比。
    在蒋区农村中，人民拒用蒋币的现象早已遍见各地。蒋记中央银行总裁俞鸿钧亦不得不承认：由于各地人民普遍自动使用银币的结果，已造成“纸币（指蒋币）向都市集中”的严重现象（据中央社六月十九日南京电）。据四月二十九日上海经济周报缓引新民报消息：蒋当局拟在云南修一条五百公里长的弥宁（从弥勒至宁蒗）公路，因当地使用“银元作单位，法币行不通”，蒋记云南省府已被迫拨给银元二十万元作为兴建费用。另据去年九月二十五日上海经济周报披露：江南农村早在去年秋天，即已普遍以特定的实物作为价格的计算单位，代替蒋币，最普通的是稻米，产纱区则为纱，一切借贷、经营、支付都以纱或米来计算，只在零星支付或双方同意时，才用蒋币。
    在中国的国际贸易中心的上海及广州，市场上亦已逐渐排除蒋币，而改用比较稳定的美钞及港币作为计算商品价格的标准。上海最初只是租房子、顶铺子系以金条美元直接计算，而自今春以来，“一些零售商也开始索取美元”了（据美联社上海五月二十七日电）。至上月底，当六月经济风暴达到顶点时，上海商店出售货物“只要可能就索取美元”（据该社六月二十五日电）。在广州，据今年四月二十九日上海经济周报援引大公报消息称：自四月涨风后，一切交易的计算单位，大部分都是用港币了，广州各报亦均以港币为单位报导商情，一切舶来品非舶来品，均以港币标价，再以港币时价伸算出蒋币售价来。该报又称：“不独广州，连县城、乡下，西纸（即港币）亦无所不通。贪官污吏之讲案件，固然以西纸为单位，强盗绑匪之掳人勒索，亦均以西纸为单位。”
    蒋币日益显著地丧失信用，标志着蒋介石通货膨胀危机的新阶段——则通货完全崩溃阶段的开始。同时也标志着美英帝国主义利用美钞港币的深入中国流通而进一步垄断蒋区经济命脉。而由于蒋区农村普遍树立起“阻遏法币侵入的堡垒”（上海经济周报语），回复到物物交换或自动改用银元；在城市中蒋币不仅作为价格标准和支付手段的作用正在消失，而且它的最后的一个机能，即作为流通手段的作用亦日益为银元及美元、港币所代替。其结果，是使“法币流通范围大为缩小”（同前）；另一方面因为黄金、美钞、港币买卖的盛行，人们不愿收存蒋币，竞将蒋币抛出，又使蒋币流通的速度大为增加，以蒋币计算的物价更涨得快。这两方面都在推动蒋币信用更加迅速崩溃。
