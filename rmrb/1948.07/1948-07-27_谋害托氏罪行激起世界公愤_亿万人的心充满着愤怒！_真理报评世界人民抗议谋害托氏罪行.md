Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. TASS News Agency reported: The Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article on the 18th entitled "The Anger of Billions." The article began by stating that the entire democratic world is protesting the evil conspiracy to murder Togliatti; the hearts of billions are filled with anger; letters and telegrams expressing workers' unity and love for anti-fascist fighters are being sent to Rome from every corner of the world; a wave of strikes and demonstrations protesting the heinous crime has swept across Italy; motions of no confidence in the government and demands for its resignation have been put forward in the Lower and Upper Houses. The article continued by stating that the Italian reactionaries' murder of Togliatti's life and their current actions are proof of their weakness, not proof of their strength. The unparalleled and sweeping momentum of the Italian people's movement in recent days proves how absurd the ruling parties' excited cries of victory after the April elections were. The article concluded by stating that the vicious murder of the leader of the Italian working people proves that international reactionaries do not hesitate to adopt the most hateful means in their anti-democratic movement. The democratic forces of the world must further unite and wage a tenacious and irreconcilable struggle against the reactionaries to respond to the assassination in Rome. The democratic people of the world cannot allow such acts of terror to happen again. The Italian working people, who are rising to defend their democratic rights, will unite more closely under the banner of the Communist Party and the People's Democratic Front and fight for their freedom, independence, and against the dark forces of reaction.

　　谋害托氏罪行激起世界公愤
  　亿万人的心充满着愤怒！
  　真理报评世界人民抗议谋害托氏罪行
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联真理报于十八日发表题为“亿万人的愤怒”的论文。论文首称，整个民主世界都在抗议谋害托格里亚蒂的邪恶阴谋；亿万人的心里充满着愤怒；表示工人团结一致和热爱反法西斯主义战士的函电，从世界上的每一个角落送往罗马；抗议恶毒罪行的罢工和游行示威浪潮席卷了全意大利；下院和上院已经提出要对政府投不信任票和要求其辞职的议案。论文继称，意大利反动派对托格里亚蒂生命的谋害及目前的作为，是他们软弱的明证，不是他们强大的明证。近日来意大利人民运动的无与伦比的横扫一切的声势，证明了四月选举后统治政党们那样兴奋高呼的胜利是何等荒诞无稽。论文末称，对意大利劳动人民领袖生命的凶恶谋害，证明了国际反动派在其反民主运动中不惜采取最令人痛恨的手段。全世界民主势力必须进一步团结，对反动派作顽强的不可调和的斗争，以回答罗马的暗杀。全世界的民主人民不能允许这种恐怖行动再行发生。正在奋起保卫其民主权利的意大利劳动人民，将在共产党和人民民主阵线的旗帜下，更密切的联合起来，为他们的自由、独立和反对反动的黑暗势力而斗争。
