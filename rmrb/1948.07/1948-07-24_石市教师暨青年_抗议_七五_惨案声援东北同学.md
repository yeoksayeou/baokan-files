Shijiazhuang Teachers and Youth
　　Protest the "July 5th" Massacre and Support Northeast Students
    [Shijiazhuang News] On the morning of the 15th, at 10:00 AM, representatives from the Shijiazhuang Youth Preparatory Committee, the Middle School Teachers' Union Preparatory Committee, and the Elementary School Teachers' Union, totaling seventeen people, held a symposium at the Girls' High School to protest the towering crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs in creating the "July 5th Massacre" and to support the Northeast students in Beiping who suffered. Resolutions: (1) Send a telegram to the World Student Association to accuse the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs of their atrocities and to support the heroic Northeast students fighting in Beiping. (2) Expand propaganda. Starting from the 25th of this month, hold an exhibition of historical serial comics depicting the massacres of students by warlords and fascist bandits since the "March 18th Incident" at the People's Education Center. On the evening of the 17th, various units went to entertainment venues to conduct propaganda, and promotional cards were added to cinemas. The full text of the telegram is now disclosed as follows:
    (1) Accusation by the educational circles and youths of Shijiazhuang City to the World Student Association regarding the "July 5th" Massacre.
    World Student Association: Under the dual oppression of feudalism and imperialism, Chinese students have consistently fought, even at the cost of bloodshed and sacrifice, to realize a new China that is independent, peaceful, and democratic since the May Fourth Movement. Precisely because of this, every patriotic and democratic movement has paid a heavy price in hot blood. On July 5th, in Beiping, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, students from the Northeast who had been threatened and deceived into coming to Beiping by Chiang Kai-shek, because they resisted Chiang Kai-shek's policy of oppression and starvation, and his plot to drive them to become cannon fodder for the Four Big Families' anti-people civil war, were subjected to a great massacre by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs using American-made bullets to destroy humanity, resulting in over a hundred deaths and injuries and thirty-seven arrests, creating the largest massacre of students since the "March 18th Incident" in 1926. The educational circles and youths of Shijiazhuang City express boundless indignation at the July 5th bloodbath, have a clearer understanding of the ferocious face of Chiang Kai-shek, the historically great butcher and traitor, and vow to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, the great butcher and traitor, as an action to protest the bloodbath. We hope that all peace-loving, democratic, and just youths around the world will unite to oppose American imperialism's support of Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, and give just assistance to the students who died and the people who are fighting unyieldingly in the Chiang-controlled areas.

    (2) Letter of Condolence to Northeast Students in Beiping
    Dear Northeast Students in Beiping:
    First of all, we express our condolences with infinite grief to the students who were killed and extend our brotherly sympathy to those who were injured and are still imprisoned.
    According to reports from various sources: those crazy bandits "used good bullets and the speed of gunfire to pursue you," resulting in over a hundred deaths and injuries on the spot. Afterwards, they falsely accused you, who were unarmed, of being the "violent thugs" who opened fire first! We, and the people of the entire liberated area, will never believe such vile lies. Bloody experience has repeatedly told us: for twenty years, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has had no better treatment for patriotic students in China than deception, threats, beatings, massacres, and spewing blood and making rumors.
    Dear Northeast students in Beiping, we all grow up on the same Chinese land, but we have different destinies: on one side is the reactionary rule of American imperialist aggressors and the Chiang bandit gang, and on the other side is the democratic and happy life of the people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This contrast becomes especially clear to us every time we hear that students in the Chiang-controlled areas are being persecuted again.
    Today, although we cannot provide you with the loving material assistance that the students in Beiping and Tianjin can, given the inhuman treatment and urgent economic difficulties you are suffering in the Chiang-controlled areas, we will launch an effective support movement here, and telegraph the World Student Association to accuse the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs of their atrocities in massacring you with American-made bullets to all mankind. We must also step up production, work, and study to support the people's revolutionary war, in order to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs as soon as possible and avenge you.
    Dear Northeast students in Beiping, stand up even stronger! The destruction of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is not far away, and the realization of a new China is just around the corner. Democracy, freedom, and happiness ultimately belong to us, to all the Chinese people.
    Finally, on behalf of all educational figures and youths in Shijiazhuang, we extend our highest respect to your heroic struggle against persecution and famine.

　　石市教师暨青年
  　抗议“七五”惨案声援东北同学
    【石家庄讯】十五日上午十时，石市青年筹委会，中学教联筹备会及小学教联等单位代表十七人，在女中举行座谈会，抗议蒋傅匪帮制造“七五惨案”的滔天罪行，声援北平东北受难同学。决议：（一）通电世界学联，控诉蒋傅匪帮的暴行，声援在平英勇奋斗的东北同学。（二）扩大宣传。自本月二十五日起，在民教馆举行自“三·一八”以来，军阀及法西斯匪徒屠杀学生的历史连环漫画展览。十七日晚各单位分赴各娱乐场所进行宣传，并在影院加放宣传卡片。现将通电原文披露如下：
    （一）石家庄市教育界及各界青年为“七五”惨案给世界学联的控诉书。
    世界学联：中国学生在封建、帝国主义的双重迫害下，从五四以来，始终不惜流血牺牲坚决为实现独立和平民主的新中国而奋斗。正因为如此，每次爱国民主运动莫不付出大量赤热的鲜血。七月五日在蒋介石匪帮统治下的北平，从东北被蒋介石威胁欺骗到平的学生，因为反抗蒋介石的压迫和饥饿政策和进而驱迫他们充当四大家族反人民内战的炮灰的阴谋，受到蒋傅匪帮用美制子弹毁灭人性的大屠杀，死伤百余人被捕三十七人，造成自一九二六年“三、一八事件”之后最大一次屠杀学生的惨案。石家庄教育界及各界青年对七五血案表示无比的愤慨，更清楚的认识了历史上大刽子手大卖国贼蒋介石的穷凶面目，而且誓以消灭大刽子手大卖国贼蒋介石作为抗议血案的行动，我们希望全世界爱好和平民主正义的青年，一致起来反对美帝扶日援蒋，给蒋区死难同学及坚强斗争不屈的人民以正义的援助。

    （二）致北平东北籍同学的慰问信
    亲爱的北平东北籍的同学们：
    首先，我们谨以无限的沉痛，对被难的同学表示悼念，并向受伤的，仍被禁闭的你们遥寄我们兄弟的慰意。
    据各方报导：那些疯狂的匪徒们：“以上好子弹就开枪的速度追击你们，”当场死伤百余人。事后，反污蔑赤手空拳的你们为先开枪的“暴徒”！这种卑劣的谎言，我们，和全解放区的人民，是永远不会相信的。血的经验一再告诉我们：二十年来蒋介石匪帮对中国的爱国学生，除了欺骗，威胁毒打，屠杀和含血喷人的造谣外，是再没有其他更好的待遇了。
    亲爱的北平东北籍同学们，我们都是生长在同一块中国的土地上，可是我们却有着不同的命运：一方面是美帝侵略者与蒋匪的反动统治，另一方面是中国共产党领导下人民大众民主幸福的生活。这一个对比，每当我们听到蒋管区同学们又一次被迫害时，就分外地看得明显了。
    今天，你们在蒋管区所遭受到非人的待遇和迫切的经济困难，我们虽不能象平津同学那样给你们以友爱的物质援助，但我们将在这里展开有效的声援运动，并电告世界学联向全人类控诉蒋傅匪帮以美制子弹残杀你们的暴行。我们更要加紧生产、工作和学习，支援人民革命战争，以期早日消灭蒋傅匪帮为你们报仇雪恨。
    亲爱的北平东北籍同学们，更坚强地站立起来吧！蒋介石匪帮的毁灭已为期不远，新中国的实现就在眼前。民主自由与幸福终归是属于我们，属于全中国人民的。
    最后，我们谨代表全石家庄教育界人士及各界青年，对你们英勇的反迫害反饥饿斗争，谨致崇高的敬意。
