Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th. The Harbin Railway Bureau's Locomotive Depot is currently conducting focused inspections of its operations to rectify labor organization and production management. Preliminary inspections have revealed that the past emphasis on completing crash tasks has severely affected regular production efficiency. First, the division of labor among cadres is unclear, leading to lax work by foremen in various departments, while the主任 (zhǔrèn - director/chief) is constantly busy, bogged down in事务主义 (shìwùzhǔyì -事務主義; routinism/engrossed in administrative trifles), unable to understand the situation below, and unable to achieve results despite their busyness. The Transportation Office of the depot has eleven locomotive engineers and instructor drivers. The tasks of the locomotive engineers and instructor drivers are not clearly defined. When problems arise, they are pushed upwards, or everyone is busy together, "busy without producing results." Second, labor organization and utilization are inappropriate. For example, the repair factory has seven teams for A, B, and C level overhaul, with too many teams and too few locomotives. Sometimes there are no locomotives to "inspect," and the workload is uneven. A total of 330 people are directly involved in overhaul. If each person works 25 days per month, they should produce a total of 8,250 work-days. However, according to March statistics, only 4,010 work-days were completed. Third, there is no strict inspection of product quality. In early June, two locomotives developed problems during trial runs. One malfunctioned due to careless installation of the axle, and the other had incorrectly installed parts. An inspection of the mechanical equipment revealed that 21 out of 51 large machines had problems, and five were damaged. Given the depot's existing conditions, the vast majority of these 26 machines could be repaired. These problems are the result of the工务室 (gōngwùshì - engineering office) not inspecting finished products, with even defective products being used. Fourth, the statistical and registration system is unsound. In the factory's work-hour records, there are many omissions and errors. There are no detailed records of how much material the warehouse issues or how many finished products the factory produces. The reporting system is unsound, affecting the inaccurate statistics of train mileage. Other shortcomings exist in technical leadership. For example, the technical office has not truly functioned as the technical assistant to the depot chief. After discovering these problems, the locomotive depot is further conducting in-depth inspections and organizing employee tour groups to visit other depots. It is also organizing grassroots cadres, activists, and heroes to lead and motivate all employees to develop improvement plans based on the identified shortcomings.

　　哈市铁路局机务段
    检查业务改进管理
    过去偏重突击损害经常生产工日浪费成品缺乏严格检查
    【新华社东北九日电】哈尔滨铁路局机务段为整顿劳动组织与生产管理工作，现正有重点的检查业务。在初步检查中，已发现由于过去偏重完成突击任务，严重地影响了经常的生产效率。第一是干部分工不明确，因此各部门工长的工作松懈，而主任则整日忙碌不堪，陷于事务主义，不了解下情，忙不出成绩来。该段运转室有机务员与指导司机十一人。机务员与指导司机的任务都不明确，遇事往上推，或者大家乱忙一起，“忙不出活来”，第二是劳动力组织与使用上不恰当。如修理工厂有甲、乙、丙三种检组修共七个组，组多车少，有时无车可“检”，工作也忙闲不一致。全厂用于直接检修的共三百三十人，如每人每月以工作二十五日计，应共作八千二百五十个工日，但据三月份统计，只作了四千零十个工日。第三是成品质量没有严格的检查。六月初有两辆机车在试验行驶中出了毛病，一辆是因车轴安装得不够仔细而发生故障，一辆把车上的零件安装错了。在检查机械装置中发现五十一部大型机器中有毛病的就占了二十一部，破损了的有五部。根据该机务段的现有条件，这二十六部机器绝大部分是可以修好的。这些都是由于工务室对成品没有检查的结果，甚至有些坏的成品也照样拿去使用。第四是统计、登记制度不健全。工厂的工时登记中，漏记和误写的不少。仓库发出多少材料，交工厂做出多少成品也没有详细帐目。报告制度不健全，影响火车行驶里程统计不精确。其他如技术领导上，也有若干缺点。如技术室没有真正发挥作为段长的技术助手的作用。该机务段发现这些问题后，正进一步作深入检查，并组织员工参观团到其他段参观；组织基层干部、积极分子、功臣等带领推动全体员工，根据已检查出的缺点订出改进计划。
