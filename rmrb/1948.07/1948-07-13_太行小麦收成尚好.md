(Taihang News) The Taihang wheat harvest this year is quite good, with the general yield averaging over 60% to 70%. The summer wheat in the vast areas along the Pinghan and Daoqing lines has now been harvested and stored. The counties in eastern Jin, where the wheat matured latest, are also harvesting. Due to the heavy snowfall last winter and the even distribution of rainfall this spring, the counties in northern Henan, the wheat-producing area, mostly had yields of 70% to 80% this year, with an average yield of over 1.3 shi (market units) per mu, nearly double that of last year. According to a survey in the fourth special district of Qin, the area planted more wheat this year, and the harvest is good, so there should be no problem eating until autumn, alleviating the threat of hunger to the masses. The masses in Xiaozuo Village are even using wheat to buy livestock. They have bought four head in the past month and plan to buy five or six more. In some places in Ci County, the average yield per mu reached 1.6 shi (market units); although the geological conditions near Wu'an City are not good, the average yield per mu was still 7 to 8 dou. In Xiangyuan, Licheng, She County and other places where wheat production has historically been low, the wheat also grew very well this year, with an average yield of about 1 shi per mu. Li Shuangkui of Dongga Village, in the third district of She County, said: "Listening to the government is never wrong. Last year, we were called upon to plant more, and this year we were told to hoe early. I planted 5.3 mu of wheat on my 6 mu of land, and I deep-hoed it early. Each ear has as many as fifty grains, and one mu yielded four big dou (each dou equals two market dou)." The masses were all overjoyed, praising the wheat harvest as one of the "three great things" in production this year (the others being good cotton seedlings and good spring vegetables). Last year, the Taihang area suffered from drought, hail, and other disasters, and the summer and autumn harvests were generally poor. In order to make up for this loss and help the masses tide over this year's spring famine, leading organs at all levels repeatedly called on the masses to expand wheat fields and tried every means (such as loans, adjusting seeds, and organizing the masses to plant in series and early planting, etc.) to organize the masses to plant wheat. Shahe, Xingtai, Wu'an, Lin County and more than a dozen other counties expanded their wheat fields by 20% to 30% compared with the year before, accounting for 50% to 70% of the total land area. Zuoquan, Yushe, Wuxiang and other ten counties expanded their wheat fields by 200,000 mu, an increase of 33% compared with the year before, accounting for 30% to 40% of the total land area. Xiyang County, which has always rarely planted wheat, also expanded its wheat area by three and a half times compared with last year, with an average of 0.5 mu of wheat land per person.

　　太行小麦收成尚好
    【太行讯】太行今年小麦收成尚好，一般收成平均在六、七成以上。现平汉、道清沿线广大地区夏麦已收好入仓。成熟最迟的晋东各县亦在收割。因去年冬雪较多，今春雨水调匀，产麦区豫北的诸县，今年多是七、八成收，每亩平均打一石三斗（市斗）以上，比去年超过将近一倍。据四专区沁调查，该地今年麦子种的多，收成又好，吃到秋天不成问题，解除了饥饿对群众的威胁。肖作村群众并拿上麦子买牲口。最近一月内已买了四头，还计划买五、六头。磁县有些地方每亩平均收到一石六斗（市斗）；武安城附近地质虽然不好，每亩也平均收七、八斗。产麦历来较少的襄垣、黎城、涉县等地，今年麦子长的也很好，每亩收到一石左右。涉县三区东戛村李双魁说：“听政府话就是没错。去年号召多种，今年让早锄，我六亩地种了五亩三分麦子，早早深锄了一遍，每个穗子足有五十多颗，一亩就打了四大斗（每斗合二市斗）。”群众都喜形于色，将麦收誉为今年生产上的“三大好”之一（余为棉苗好，春菜好）。按去年太行区因旱雹等灾，夏秋普遍歉收，各级领导机关为弥补这一损失，帮助群众渡过今年春荒，曾多次号召群众扩大麦田；并想尽各种办法（如借贷、调剂种子，组织群众串种、早种等）组织群众种麦。沙河、邢台、武安、林县等十余县，比前年扩大麦田百分之二十至三十，占土地总面积百分之五十至七十。左权、榆社、武乡等十县扩大麦田二十万亩，较前年增加百分之三十三，占总土地面积百分之三十到四十。向来很少种麦的昔阳县，也比去年扩大了三倍半，平均每人有五分麦地。
