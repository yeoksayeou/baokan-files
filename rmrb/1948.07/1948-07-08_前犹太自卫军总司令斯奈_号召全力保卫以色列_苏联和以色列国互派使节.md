　　Former Haganah Commander Sneh
    Calls for All-Out Defense of Israel
    Soviet Union and State of Israel Exchange Envoys
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] TASS dispatch of June 25th: Former Haganah commander Sneh, in an interview with the American Communist Party organ, the Daily Worker, in Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel, stated that he urged the State of Israel to immediately mobilize all forces to defend the country and had suggested establishing the closest ties "with Israel's true friends, first and foremost the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies." Regarding Bernadotte's so-called "mediation," Sneh first condemned Bernadotte's injustice: First, he gave the Arabs more than two days to improve their positions in the Galilee region (in northeastern Israel); second, he misinterpreted the Security Council's decision on immigration during the truce; third, he only invited representatives from the three imperialist "powers" of the US, France, and Belgium to participate in the truce supervision mechanism. Sneh then predicted that Bernadotte would conduct political negotiations between the Arabs and Israel in the spirit of a new Anglo-American compromise.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th] TASS dispatch: The Soviet government announced on June 25th that it would exchange envoys with the State of Israel. The Soviet Union has appointed Yershov as Minister Plenipotentiary to the State of Israel, and the State of Israel has appointed Mrs. Meyerson as Minister to the Soviet Union. According to the US News Service: Truman announced on June 22nd that the US and Israeli governments had reached an agreement on the exchange of diplomatic missions. The US has appointed McDonald (former US member of the Anglo-American Palestine Inquiry Committee, former chief writer for the New York Times) as head of the US mission to Israel, and Epstein has been announced as head of the Israeli mission to the US.

　　前犹太自卫军总司令斯奈
    号召全力保卫以色列
    苏联和以色列国互派使节
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社六月二十五日消息：前犹太自卫军（即哈根纳）总司令斯奈，在以色列首都特拉维夫对美国共产党机关报工人日报记者发表谈话称：他敦促以色列国立即动员一切力量以保卫国家，并已建议“与以色列的真正朋友，首先与苏联及人民民主国家”建立最密切的邦交。论及伯纳杜特的所谓“调停”时，斯奈首先斥责伯纳杜特的不公正：第一、他给阿剌伯两天多的时间，以改善在加利里区（在以色列东北部）的阵地；第二、他曲解安理会对停战时移民入境问题的决定；第三、他只邀请美、法、比三个帝国主义“强国”的代表参加停战监督的机构。斯奈继而预测称：伯纳杜特将本着新的英美妥协的精神来进行阿剌伯与以色列间的政治谈判。
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联政府于六月二十五日公布与以色列国互派使节的消息，苏联已任命耶德夫为驻以色列国特命全权公使，以色列国则任命梅耶逊夫人为驻苏公使。又据美新闻处讯：杜鲁门于六月二十二日宣布，美以两国政府已就交换外交代表团一事获致协议。美方已任命麦唐纳（前英美巴勒斯坦调查委员会美方委员，原纽约时报主笔）为美驻以色列代表团团长，埃普斯坦则被宣布为以色列驻美代表团团长。
