　　Nanku Hancun Military Dependents' Women Rely on Their Own Labor, No Need for Substitute Labor
    Guo Latao and four other military dependents' women in Nanku Hancun, Shouyang District, Taihang, took "Men fight the enemy in the front, women engage in farming at home" as their slogan. This year, during sowing and weeding, they organized themselves to go to the fields for farming, without needing the village to provide substitute labor. They have already finished the first weeding of their own seedlings. Another military dependent, Zhang Fenghua (new middle peasant), is exchanging labor with others (female labor for male labor), and has not asked the village to allocate any work points since spring. She said, "This year's famine is very serious, and everyone is facing difficulties. We can still work ourselves, so we can save some work points for the substitute labor households, so they can work for other families and earn some money to get through the famine. As long as our men win more battles and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan sooner, it will be better than anything else." Disregarding the difficulties, she and her sister went to the fields for six days (a total of twelve work points) and weeded seventeen mu of millet.

　　南库韩村军属妇女自己劳动不用代耕
    太行寿阳一区南库韩村军属妇女郭拉桃等五人，以“男人前方打敌人，女人在家闹养种”为口号，今年在下种和锄苗中，都自己组织起来下地耕作，不用村里代耕。现已将自家小苗锄完头遍。另一军属张粉花（新中农）是和别人变工互助（女工换男工），从春天到现在没让村里给拨过一个工。她说：“今年灾荒很厉害，大家都困难。咱现在自己还能劳动，给代耕户省下些工，叫他们给别人家做活，赚些钱渡灾荒吧。只要俺男人多打胜仗，把蒋介石、阎锡山早些消灭了，比啥也强。”她不顾困难，和她妹妹二人下地锄了六天（共十二个工），锄谷十七亩。
