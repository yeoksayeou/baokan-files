　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 28th: Reports from various sources: The first national congress of the U.S. Third Party opened in Philadelphia on the 23rd amidst enthusiastic excitement. The congress was attended by 3,000 delegates from various states of the United States, and together with guests from all walks of life, the opening meeting was attended by more than 10,000 people. The congress was held in the same venue where the Republican and Democratic parties held their congresses not long ago. Despite the fact that the reactionary press and radio had copied Hitler's old tricks, launching a "red scare" campaign to slander the new party, the enthusiastic atmosphere in the venue was completely different from the previous congresses of the Democratic and Republican parties. Every seat in the delegate section was filled. The first day of the congress was devoted to listening to speeches by the main leaders of the new party movement, and their speeches were often interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience. Wallace, a candidate for chairman of the national committee, and former Minnesota Governor Benson declared in their speeches that the new party would stop the rule of the two parties, which had become servants of the wealthy, and return the government to the people. Baldwin, the director of Wallace's campaign, campaigned for the success of the new party movement in his speech. Baldwin said that there were already various organizations belonging to the new party in all states of the United States. The new party can run in at least 44 states. Baldwin finally suggested that the new party be named the Progressive Party. The congress then listened to the central speaker, the famous black leader Howard. In his speech, which fiercely criticized the current foreign policy of the American reactionaries, Howard said that American foreign policy was the product of banker diplomats and banker militarists. American cannons are currently slaughtering innocent civilians in at least three places in the world. Howard emphasized that the new party would fight for peace and Soviet-American friendship, and condemned the United States for using the threat of the Soviet Union as an excuse to establish a huge military program; condemned the Truman government for twice "slamming the door on the peace plan" after the exchange of letters between the United States and the Soviet Union and Stalin's reply to Wallace's letter, and is now "reaping the bitter fruit it has sown" on the Berlin issue. Howard continued to point out that the two parties have strangled civil rights and price controls in their domestic policies, and have formulated the reactionary Taft-Hartley Labor Act. Howard advocated the abolition of the conscription law and the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, and stipulated that the minimum wage for workers should be one U.S. dollar per hour. Howard's speech won enthusiastic cheers from the delegates. Following Howard's speech, there were 11 other leaders of the new party. The speakers all attacked the Republican and Democratic parties in unison. At the end of the day, the congress officially passed the permanent name of the new party as the "Progressive Party."

　　为和平与美苏友谊而斗争
  　美第三党召开代表大会
  　讨论政纲通过永久名称为“进步党”
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】各方报导：美第三党第一次全国代表大会，二十三日于热烈兴奋情绪中在费城揭幕。大会到有美国各州代表三千名，连同各界来宾在内，参加大会开幕会议者，共达万人以上。大会系于不久前共和与民主两党举行大会之同一会场中举行。尽管反动报界及广播曾抄袭希特勒故技，发动“赤色妖魔”运动以诬蔑新党，但会场中的热烈情形，则与上两次民主共和两党的大会，迥然不同。代表席中，座无虚位。大会第一日为听取新党运动各主要负责人的演说，他们的演说不时为会场中热烈的掌声所打断。华莱士竞选全国委员会主席及前明尼苏达州州长宾生在其演说中宣称：新党将阻止被已变成富豪奴仆的两党统治，并将政府交还给人民。华莱士竞选运动主任鲍尔温于其演说中竞选新党运动的成功。鲍氏称，美国所有各州中均已有属于新党的各种组织。新党至少在四十四州内可以进行竞选。鲍氏最后建议新党定名为进步党。大会继即听取中心发言人，著名黑人领袖郝瓦德的演说。郝氏在其猛烈抨击美国反动派现行对外政策的演说中称：美国外交政策乃是银行团外交家与银行团军国主义者的产儿。美国大炮目前至少正在世界上三个地方，屠杀无辜平民。郝氏强调新党将为和平与美苏友谊而斗争，并斥责美国借口苏联的威胁以建立庞大的军备计划；斥责杜鲁门政府在美苏换文及斯大林答复华莱士信件以后，两度“砰然关上和平计划之门”，而现在则正在柏林问题上，“自食其所种下的苦果”。郝氏继指出：两党在对内政策上绞杀了公民权利与物价管制，并制定了反动的塔夫脱——哈特莱劳工法。郝氏主张废除征兵法与塔夫脱——哈特莱劳工法，并规定工人每小时的最低工资为美金一元。郝氏演说赢得了代表们的热烈喝彩。继郝氏演说者，尚有新党其他领袖十一人。演说者均异口同声地攻击共和与民主两党。当天大会最后正式通过新党的永久名称为“进步党”。
