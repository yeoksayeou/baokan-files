[Jidong Frontline, 3rd dispatch] When the People's Liberation Army cleared the periphery of Changli and advanced on the city's four gates on the 25th of last month, the defending Chiang bandits and the puppet county government, under the guise of "protecting student safety," deceived approximately 1,000 faculty and students from Huiwen Middle School, Yuzhen Girls' Middle School, the Women's Normal School, and the Agricultural Vocational School outside the city into entering the city. They were concentrated together with the teachers and students of the county middle school, forcibly organized into squads and platoons, and forced to build core fortifications on the side of the county middle school under heavy fire for the Chiang bandits. They also carried stretchers and transported ammunition, resulting in many students being injured by artillery fire. At 10:00 AM, when the People's Liberation Army attacked the enemy's碉堡 (diāobǎo - bunker, pillbox) on the west side of the county middle school, the Chiang bandits inside the碉堡 continued to use intense firepower to block the retreat, making it impossible for these faculty and students to escape the dangerous situation. Later, under the full cover of our assault troops, they were finally transferred out of the enemy's firepower blockade and escorted to a safe area outside the west gate. Injured students Tao Guocheng and Wang Wanqing, among others, were bandaged and given medicine, and those seriously injured were sent to the hospital for treatment. After the battle, the People's Liberation Army immediately consulted with the faculty of each school and asked them to take all the students back to their original schools. The People's Liberation Army's correct policy of caring for faculty and young students deeply moved the teachers and students of all the schools, who said in unison: "Comrades are so good, we are truly indescribably grateful."

　　攻克昌黎我军
    保护学校教员学生
    【冀东前线三日电】人民解放军于上月二十五日扫清昌黎外围进逼该城四关时，守城蒋匪及伪县政府，竟以“保护学生安全”为名，将城外之汇文中学，育贞女中、女师及农职等校教职员学生共约一千余人骗入城内，与县立中学之师生集中一起，强迫他们编成班、排，在炮火下为蒋匪修筑县立中学校侧之核心堡垒，并抬担架，运输弹药，致使不少学生为炮弹击伤。上午十时，人民解放军击迫县立中学西侧，向该处碉堡敌人攻击时，碉堡内蒋匪仍以密集火力封锁退路，使这批教职员学生，无法脱离险境。后在我突击部队全力掩护下，终于从敌火力封锁下将他们全部转移出来，护送至西关外安全地带，并给受伤学生陶国成、王完庆等人包裹上药，伤重者送院治疗。战斗结束后，解放军马上和各校教职员商妥，请他们将全体学生带返原校。解放军此种爱护教职员及青年学生的正确政策，各校师生均深受感动，异口同声的说：“同志们太好了，我们真是说不出来的感激。”
