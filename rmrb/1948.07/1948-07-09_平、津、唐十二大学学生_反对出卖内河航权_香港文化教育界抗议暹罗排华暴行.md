Xinhua News Agency, North China, July 7th: According to the Tianjin Yishi Daily, students in Peiping, Tientsin, and Tangshan unanimously oppose the Chiang government's selling of China's inland waterway rights to the United States. Student unions from twelve universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Teachers College, Sino-French University, Chaoyang University, North China College, Railway Management College, and Art Academy in Peiping, and Nankai University, Peiyang University, and Tangshan Institute of Technology in Tientsin, issued a joint declaration on June 25th. The declaration stated: At a time when the entire country is opposing the U.S. support for Japan and rescuing the national crisis, the U.S. is intensifying its plunder of China's sovereignty, and the government, for the sake of U.S. aid, is sacrificing national interests by selling inland waterway rights. The declaration pointed out that this treasonous deal by the Chiang government has aroused "opposition from the National Navigation Association and people in various regions." After refuting Wang Shijie's fallacy that "opening inland waterway rights does not hinder China's sovereignty," the declaration firmly stated: In order to oppose the opening of inland waterway rights, to protect national industry and commerce, to rescue the national crisis, and to protect the integrity of sovereignty, we are determined to promote unity among all classes, overcome all difficulties, and brave all dangers to jointly defend the independence of the Chinese nation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 3rd, 59 prominent figures in Hong Kong's cultural and educational circles signed a declaration protesting the Siamese fascist Luang Phibuns government's瘋狂狂狂 anti-Chinese atrocities and the Chiang government's shameful "silent" attitude towards this matter. The declaration described the Siamese government's order on May 5th to close more than 30 overseas Chinese schools, depriving 100,000 Chinese children of the opportunity to receive education, and the arrest of more than 50 overseas Chinese on June 12th (this arrest was carried out with the direct cooperation of Chiang Kai-shek's special service organs stationed in Siam), and questioned why the Chiang government "remains silent" about this. The dispatch pointed out that those arrested included Zhu Qun, the principal of Nanyang Middle School, and Chen Cangbo (both transliterations) of the Overseas Chinese Association.
