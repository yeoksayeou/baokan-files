Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 7th: During the recent Kaifeng campaign, the cultural institutions within the city suffered terribly from the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' looting. Henan University, the highest institution of learning in Henan Province, was occupied by the enemy's 66th Division on the 17th, which converted the campus into defensive fortifications and artillery positions. Students were driven out of the school, and most of the school's books and equipment were destroyed, with students' clothing looted. After Chiang's bandit troops retreated to Longting on the 18th, they coordinated with U.S.-made Chiang aircraft to launch continuous and frenzied bombings against Henan University. The school's student dormitory, New East Study Hall, was reduced to ashes by incendiary bombs, and the medical school and auditorium also suffered extensive damage. Many students were killed and wounded in the bombings. Those who have been identified include Zhang Qin, a second-year student in the Economics Department, and Liu Shushan and Liu Shixie of the Education Department, who were killed in the bombing. Other injured students have received emergency treatment from the People's Liberation Army. When Chiang's troops retreated into the city from the South Gate on the 18th, they set fires everywhere in the South Gate. Coupled with the bombings by Chiang's aircraft, the main building of Zhenguang Middle School in the South Gate was left with only its frame, and China Middle School, adjacent to the South City, was completely destroyed. From the 20th to the 21st, when Chiang's bandits gathered at the pseudo-Henan Provincial Government to resist stubbornly, they set fire to Northwest Middle School, Lianghe Middle School, Kaifeng Women's Normal School, Provincial Fourth Elementary School, and Kaifeng Radio Station in the surrounding area. When Chiang's bandits set fire to the Women's Normal School, they neither notified the students in advance nor allowed them to leave the dormitory while the fire was raging. The cries for help from the female students in the raging flames were unbearable to hear. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army arrived at this time and rushed into the school. The students of the Women's Normal School shouted, "The students are downstairs!" The People's Liberation Army pursued and annihilated the fleeing enemy while rescuing the students, and all the female students were saved from the disaster. In addition, the Kaifeng Museum was partially destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits stationed in Longting. The Central China Institute of Technology was also bombed by U.S.-made Chiang aircraft. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, it repaired a ambulance for the Henan University Hospital and subsidized the Catholic Church Hospital in the South Gate for the treatment of wounded students. The People's Liberation Army also allocated a large amount of rice and flour from Chiang's army warehouse to provide relief to students of various schools, and marked and protected various cultural and educational institutions.

　　开封文教机关惨遭蒋匪洗劫我军在炮火中尽力营救保护
    【新华社开封前线七日电】此次开封战役中，城内各文化机关，惨遭蒋匪洗劫。河南最高学府河南大学校舍，十七日被敌六十六师侵占，改设防御工事及炮兵阵地，学生被驱逐出校，学校图书仪器大部被毁，学生衣物被抢劫一空。十八日蒋匪军退守龙亭后，即配合美制蒋机向河南大学连续疯狂轰击，该校学生宿舍新东斋被燃烧弹毁为灰烬，医学院及大礼堂亦毁损极巨。学生多人被炸死炸伤。据已查明者有经济系二年级学生张钦、教育系刘书善、刘士燮等被炸死，其他负伤学生均经解放军予以紧急治疗。蒋军于十八日自南关溃退城内时，曾在南关到处纵火，加以蒋机轰炸，南关之真光中学大楼仅存骨架，接南城的中国中学则荡然无存。二十日至二十一日蒋匪集结伪河南省政府顽抗时，即将周围的西北中学、两河中学、开封女师、省立四小与开封广播电台等纵火焚烧。蒋匪焚烧女师时，事先既不通知，放火时又不准女学生离开宿舍，在熊熊火焰中女学生哀号求救声，惨不忍闻。幸解放军于此时赶到，冲入该校，女师同学大呼“楼下是学生”，解放军乃一面追歼溃敌，一面营救学生，全部女同学始免于难。此外，开封博物馆被据守龙亭之蒋匪炮轰摧毁一部，中原工学院亦被美制蒋机轰炸。解放军入城后，当为河南大学医院修好救护车一辆，并补助南关天主堂医院治疗受伤同学之费用。解放军并由蒋军仓库中拨出大量米面，救济各校同学，并分别牌示保护各文化教育机关。
