[Changzhi News] After the implementation of "Land to the Tiller" in Nanbei Great Cooperative, Wu'an Third District, each person had an average of six mu of land. Because of the small labor force, they could not cultivate all of it, so they donated 200 mu to the peasant brothers in the neighboring Wuhe Township.

Wuhe Township has barren land, with an average of just over two mu of land per person, and often has to sell labor in other villages to make a living. The two big landlords in Nanbei Great Cooperative occupied more than 50 qing of land, and were the main villages where Wuhe Township sold its labor. Now these lands have been taken back by the peasants, but due to the lack of labor, they cannot be fully cultivated. The village leadership proposed: "Now that we have turned the tables, we must also help the neighboring villages to turn the tables." After discussion and deliberation by the masses, it was decided to donate 200 mu of land to the poor brothers in Wuhe Township. The villagers of Wuhe Township were extremely excited when they heard the news, and immediately sent a reply to express their gratitude, saying: Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao could such a thing be possible. They also said: Although we are poor, we do not lack labor. In the future, we will actively help you with some things, just as you help us. (Shi Hong)

[Changzhi News] Many landlords in Wu'an Third District, after the mass movement, have realized the boredom and shame of parasitic exploitation and have generally become involved in productive labor. When the peasants were carrying out the "Land to the Tiller" grievances and settling accounts, they gave the landlords' lives the necessary care. The landlords, feeling grateful, expressed one after another that they would rebuild their families in future production just like the peasants. They said: The family started with one's own labor is the most solid and promising. Landlords from the same association said when requesting to join mutual aid groups, I don't know how to farm, let the villagers teach me! Landlord Yang Peilong, when the work in the fields was slack, would pick up a vegetable basket and sell it everywhere. He said: As long as you participate in production properly, there is no problem with life. Yang Tixian, who is over fifty years old, used to have two wives and employed several long-term workers. Now he and his wife and children are working very hard. He smiled and said to the reporter: I can carry, pick, and plant now, look how good! As women in the new district are generally participating in production, the daughters-in-law and daughters of landlord families are also freely jumping out of the door and heading to the fields. Cheng Shuxian and Zhai Lucong from Boyan are both young women in their twenties, and now they can carry water and manure, and also harvest and hoe seedlings. The villagers unanimously praised them as good women, and the radio station also called on women to learn from them.

　　南北大社农民帮助邻村翻身
    赠田二百余亩给五和乡
    武安地主纷纷参加劳动
    【长治讯】武安三区南北大社在推行“耕者有其田”后，每人平均有六亩土地，因劳力较少，不能全部耕种，乃以二百亩赠给邻村五和乡的农民弟兄。
    五和乡地瘠土薄，每人平均土地不过二亩多，经常到外村卖工度日。南北大社两家大地主就占有土地五十多顷，为五和乡卖工主要村庄。现在这些土地已由农民收回，但因劳力缺乏，不能全部耕种，该村领导上即提出“咱们翻了身，还须帮助邻村翻身。”经群众酝酿讨论后，乃决定以二百亩地赠给五和乡的贫苦弟兄们，五和乡村民闻讯，感奋异常，当即复函申谢，并说：只有在共产党毛主席领导下，这样的事情才会成为可能。又称：我们虽穷，但劳力不缺，以后我们将主动的帮助你们作一些事情，如同你们帮助我们一样。（史洪）
    【长治讯】武安三区许多地主，经过群众运动，认识了寄生剥削生活的无聊与可耻，已普遍的卷入生产劳动中，农民们进行“耕者有其田”的诉苦清算时，对于地主的生活都给以必要的照顾，地主们感激之余，纷纷表示，要在今后的生产中和农民一样把自己的家再发起来。他们说：用自己劳动发起的家是最巩固的，是最有前途的。同会地主在请求参加互助组时说，我不会种地，乡亲们让我学学吧！地主杨培龙，在地里活闲时，就挑起菜担四外出卖，他说：只要好好参加生产，生活是没有问题的。五十多岁的杨体现，过去有两个老婆用着几个长工，现在他和他老婆孩子劳动的很起劲，他笑着对记者说：我现在会担会挑会种，您看有多好！由于新区妇女普遍的参加生产，地主家的媳妇闺女也自由的跳出门限走向田园。伯延程书贤、翟路从，都是二十多岁的青年妇女，现在能担水担粪，还能收割锄苗，村里人一致称赞她们是好妇女，广播台上也号召妇女们向她们学习。
