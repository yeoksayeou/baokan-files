Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: A Kuling dispatch reports that the *Lihsing Daily* here published an editorial entitled "Correcting the Cowardly, Selfish Mentality and Absurd Arguments of *Ta Kung Pao*," publicly announcing that the Kuomintang government "has no intention of recognizing" the communique of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference last December. This demonstrates its determination to disregard opposition from domestic and international public opinion, persist in the civil war dictatorship, and defend Chiang Kai-shek, saying he is not Franco. The *Lihsing Daily* editorial claimed: "China did not participate in the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference last December, and is therefore not bound by the communique of this conference. After the communique of this conference was published, China had neither the intention of accepting it nor the intention of recognizing it." It slandered the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference communique as "international interference," "power politics," and "aggression," indicating its unwillingness to abide by the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference communique to stop the civil war and reorganize government institutions, so that China could become an independent, peaceful, and democratic country. Chiang Kai-shek, fearing sanctions from the United Nations and international public opinion, used the *Lihsing Daily* to repeatedly say: "Since the establishment of the National Government, international interference has followed one after another, but the National Government has no fear." But at the same time, he allows American imperialists to interfere in China's internal affairs and tortuously defends the continued presence of American troops in China, saying that this is "based on the treaty of 1942," is "repaying kindness with kindness," and is "a righteous act of Commander-in-Chief Chiang of the China war zone," willingly selling China's territorial sovereignty to American imperialism.

After Chiang Kai-shek read *Ta Kung Pao*'s warning not to become the second Spain, he immediately thought that he was the second Franco, and deeply feared falling into Franco's fate in diplomacy. Therefore, he ordered the *Lihsing Daily* to quickly issue a statement denying the obvious, saying, "You regard the anti-aggression and anti-hegemony National Government as the aggressive Franco, which only proves that there is no justice in your mind."

Finally, Chiang Kai-shek instructed the *Lihsing Daily* to warn *Ta Kung Pao* that "those who fear punishment will inevitably be washed away by the tide of revolutionary China." This is because Chiang Kai-shek and others are very afraid that *Ta Kung Pao*'s article will affect his camp and make many people lose confidence in the civil war.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: In order to coordinate the launch of a nationwide civil war, Chiang Kai-shek recently personally presided over a national propaganda conference of the Kuomintang in Kuling to carry out anti-people and anti-communist deception and mobilization. According to a Central News Agency dispatch: The conference opened in Kuling on the morning of the 1st, convened by Deng Wenyi, director of the News Bureau of Chiang Kai-shek's government's Ministry of National Defense and one of the "Thirteen Taibao of Revival." Chiang Kai-shek personally presided over the meeting and gave a one-hour "instruction." Participants included more than 60 senior political officers from various headquarters (formerly known as "Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters," now renamed "Chairman's Headquarters" after the establishment of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense), various Pacification Commissioner's Offices, and various armies and divisions. Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang, and foreign propaganda advisors to the Kuomintang government, Bell and Lu Qixin, also rushed to Kuling from Nanjing on the same day to participate. The conference is scheduled to close on the 5th. The Central News Agency stated: "This conference will summarize and review the army's political work system and its achievements over the past 20 years, and determine a new style for future cultural and educational work in the military." Since Chiang Kai-shek abandoned the Nanjing peace talks and stepped onto this historically famous civil war command post—Mount Lu—he has convened a series of military and political conferences to carry out comprehensive civil war deployment and mobilization. On the 24th, Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech at the Lushan Summer Camp, openly reviewing the history of the Ten-Year Civil War and examining the role of the Lushan Training Corps in 1933 during the tense military suppression of the Communists. He urged officers and students of the Summer Camp to recognize the "great importance of the current mission" and to engage in a "final showdown" with all democratic forces. At the same time, he used the official propaganda organ, the Central News Agency, and the newly established Kuling edition of the *Central Daily News* to widely fabricate rumors. In addition to issuing fabricated war reports every day, he repeatedly "denied" the facts that Division Commander Pan Shuoduan and Air Force Captain Liu Shanben resolutely withdrew from the civil war, as well as the loss of 20,000 people in northern Jiangsu, in order to stabilize the wavering and war-weary morale within the Chiang army.

　　牯岭力行日报著文
    辩护蒋介石不是佛朗哥
    却又公开表示坚持内战独裁，诋毁莫斯科三国外长决议。
    【新华社延安三日电】牯岭讯：此间力行日报以“纠正大公报卑怯自私心理与荒唐论调”为题，发表社论，公开宣布国民党政府对去年十二月莫斯科三外长会议公报“没有承认的意思”，表明决心不顾国内外舆论的反对，坚持内战独裁，并替蒋介石辩获，说他不是佛朗哥。力行日报社论声称：“中国没有参加去年十二月莫斯科外长会议，当然不受这个会议公报的拘束，中国于这个会议公报发表之后，既没有接受的意思，也没有承认的意思”。污蔑三外长会议公报为“国际干涉”、“强权政治”与“侵略主义”，表明不愿遵照三外长会议公报停止内战与改组政府机构，使中国成为一独立和平民主的国家。蒋介石害怕联合国和国际舆论制裁，通过力行日报，口口声声说：“自国民政府成立后，国际干涉接踵而来，国民政府毫无畏惧”。但同时却又让美帝国主义者干涉中国内政，并曲意为美军留驻中国辩护，说这是“根据一九四二年的条约”，是“以德报德”，是“中国战区统帅蒋委员长义所予的”，甘心情愿把中国的领土主权出卖给美帝国主义。
    蒋介石看了大公报警告不要做西班牙第二之后，立刻想到自己就是佛朗哥第二，并深惧在外交上会陷于佛朗哥的命运，于是命令力行日报赶快声明此地无银三百两，“你把反侵略强权的国民政府看做侵略主义的佛朗哥，这只是证明你的心目里面没有正义”。
    最后蒋介石授意力行日报警告大公报说：“畏罪之徒是必为革命中国的潮流所冲洗”。这是因为蒋介石等十分害怕大公报那篇文章会影响他的营垒，使许多人失去内战的信心。
    【新华社延安三日电】为配合全国规模内战之展开，蒋介石顷在牯岭亲自主持国民党全国性宣传会议，以进行反人民反共的欺骗和动员。据中央社讯：该会议一日晨在牯岭开幕，由蒋介石政府国防部新闻局长、复兴十三太保之一邓文仪召集，名称为“业务检讨会”，蒋介石亲临主持，并作一小时之“训话”，参加者有各行辕（按即前之“委员长行营”，蒋介石国防部成立后，现已改称“主席行辕”、各绥靖公署、各军师之高级政工人员等六十余人。国民党中宣部长彭学沛，国民党政府外人宣传顾问贝尔及卢祺新等，亦于是日由京赶到牯岭参加，会议定五日闭幕。中央社称：“此会将对二十余年来之军队政工制度及其成果作一总结检讨。并确定今后军中文化教育工作之新的作风”。自蒋介石抛开南京和平谈判，踏上这座历史上有名的内战司令台——庐山后，即召开一连串的军事政治会议，进行全面内战的布置和动员。二十四日，蒋在庐山夏令营训话，公然回溯十年内战历史，检讨民国二十二年剿共军事紧张时庐山训练团之作用，要夏令营官长、学生认识当前“使命的重大”，与一切民主势力“总决斗”。同时，即通过御用宣传机关中央社与新近特办之牯岭版中央日报，广泛制造谣言，除每日颁布捏造的战报外，并一再“否认”潘朔端师长和刘善本空军上尉毅然退出内战，以及苏北丧失二万人的事实，以安定蒋军内部动摇厌战的军心。
