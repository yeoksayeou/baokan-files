Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 17th. Shanghai Wenhui Daily reporter Zhao Zecheng and Zhenbao reporter Li Chunyi visited Pengjiashigou, Liangdian, Yanbin and other villages and towns in the Binhai Liberated Area on July 25th. They spoke highly of the happy life of the people in the liberated area, who were developing their production, becoming wealthy, well-fed, and enjoying democracy and freedom. When the two reporters witnessed the young children in the literacy class and the women in the literacy group in Pengjiashigou diligently studying, each having already learned 500 to 1,000 characters, and the teachers leading the students in practical teaching of cotton cultivation in their spare time, they considered it one of the best methods of popularizing education and applying what is learned. The two reporters paid particular attention to the fact that the farmers in Dongyan Village automatically held meetings to arrange production and discuss how to help military families, and praised it as a concrete manifestation of the people's enthusiasm after they had turned over economically. Zhao said with emotion: "In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, there are no such meetings at all, because the people there do not have a democratic government elected by themselves." When he went to Village × to visit the masses' production, he saw that the crops along the way were particularly luxuriant. After the farmers introduced that the village had realized "the tillers have their land", and implemented mutual aid by exchanging labor to save labor and increase production, the two reporters praised this method of planned use of labor to organize production. One day, the two reporters went to Dalvqian Village to interview the labor hero Zheng Xin. They inquired in detail about Zheng Xin's journey from starting a wasteland reclamation to becoming a wealthy middle peasant owning more than 30 mu of land, earning two and saving one this year, and being elected as a labor hero and receiving the government's award of耕牛 (draft cattle), agricultural tools, etc. That evening, they also attended the village's literacy class and saw a meeting where everyone checked their production plans and reviewed their labor concepts. They were amazed by the enthusiastic and orderly speeches of the rural women at the meeting, and said that although the mountains and rivers remained the same, the people's thinking and social atmosphere were world apart compared to the past. Based on their observations in various places, the two reporters expressed their impressions, saying: "The people in the liberated areas have developed democratic living habits. Seeing is believing, and the impression now is a thousand times better than what I heard about the liberated areas before. Visiting and understanding the democratic construction of the liberated areas has increased our confidence in winning peace and democracy."

    【新华社临沂十七日电】沪文汇报记者赵则诚、真报记者李纯一两氏，于上月二十五日来滨海解放区参观莒县彭家仕沟、良店、筵宾等村镇，对解放区人民生产发家、丰衣足食、民主自由的幸福生活，备加赞扬。当两氏目睹彭家仕沟青年儿童识字班妇女识字组学员，均努力学习，每人已识五百至一千字，教员在课余领导学生修棉的实用教学，他们认为是普及教育与学以致用的最好方法之一。两氏对东筵村农民自动开会布置生产，并讨论如何帮助军属等问题尤为注意，誉之为人民在经济上翻身后热情的具体表现。赵氏感慨地说：“在国民党统治区，根本没有这样的会，因为那里老百姓没有自己选举的民主政府。”当他到×村参观群众生产时，见沿途庄禾特别茂盛，经农民介绍该村已实现“耕者有其田”，且实行变工互助、以节省劳力提高产量等情后，两氏对此种有计划运用劳力组织生产的办法，颇为称赞。一日两氏继赴大履前村访问劳动英雄郑信，对郑信由开荒起家现已成为拥有土地三十余亩之富裕中农，今年已走到耕二余一及当选为劳动英雄后获得政府奖予耕牛、农具等的经过，询问甚详。是晚复参加该村识字班，见各人检查生产计划、检讨劳动观念的会议，对农村妇女在会上踊跃而有条理的发言甚为惊异，咸谓山川依旧而人民思想及社会风气，今昔相较已有天壤之别。两氏以各地观察所得，发表印象称：“解放区人民，已养成民主生活习惯，百闻不如一见，此刻印象较诸以前所听到的解放区，要好千百倍。参观了解放区民主建设后，增加了我们争取和平民主的胜利信心。”
