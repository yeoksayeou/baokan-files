　  Two Hundred Thousand People Swept Up in the Tidal Wave of Emancipation
    The Mass Movement in Anyang Spreads Like Wildfire
    Rationally Distributing the Fruits of Struggle, Everyone in Xijishan Has Land to Cultivate
    [Report from Our Newspaper in Anyang] The liquidation and emancipation movement of the masses in the new district of Anyang is continuing to develop vigorously and deeply. Because the cadres at all levels resolutely implemented the county party committee's resolution, mobilized the vast middle peasants, and united the entire peasant masses to advance towards the feudal forces, the scale of the movement is unprecedentedly grand. The leadership seized upon the current urgent demands of the masses and re-rationally distributed the fruits, starting from the liquidation of the burdens shifted onto the peasants by the feudal clique under the eight years of enemy and puppet rule. This opened up the situation for the movement, and the movement spread universally like a prairie fire. In the first half of July, among the 420 natural villages in the new district (excluding those who stubbornly resisted), 300 had already launched heated struggles. The movement in villages such as Xijishan, Fucheng, Xiqingliu, Qingyu, and Dongzhangwu developed best. Even Xizizhen Village and Shuangquan Village, where the reactionary forces were strongest during the previous riot of secret societies, opened up the situation. The number of households participating in the movement in the county reached 80% to 90%, with more than 200,000 people. Many masses locked their doors and participated in the accusations with their whole families. Under the storm of the masses' emancipation, the lackeys and henchmen disintegrated and broke apart, and the previously powerful feudal ruling clique and special agents were isolated and forced to lower their heads, quickly spitting out their spoils. Many villages set up sheds and held struggle meetings, with shouts and arguments filling the air, extremely tense and lively. In the movement, the poor peasants were particularly active. Some rich peasants and workers from the Guantai Coal Mine also participated in the struggle. The daughter-in-law of the local tyrant and landlord Li Xiaofeng from Shuiye also went to accuse him of his crimes. In Fucheng, 840 out of 932 households made accusations at the meetings. The masses forgot their hunger and fatigue. The Tongyeqiao Village spoke for a whole day and night, and the meeting did not end until dawn. The Shijian Village spoke for three consecutive days and still hadn't finished. Many "honest peasants" rushed to pour out their grievances. The more "honest" they were, the more grievances they poured out. Many villages accused as a whole family. Old women beat the local tyrants and traitors with crutches as they accused them. Little children cried loudly as they accused them, demanding the mother who had been forced to death. The emotions of the masses were exceptionally indignant and high. The results of the movement were extremely good. The peasants of Xijishan had legally recovered more than 1,700 mu of land, eliminating poverty and extreme poverty. The ideological consciousness of the masses has been universally improved. When they went to recover the spoils, they all said in unison: "Let's go, let's get our things back!" The masses in Fucheng wore the clothes returned by the landlords and local tyrants and danced the Yangko everywhere with excitement, singing the emancipation song: "After settling the accounts of eight years of blood and tears, we will not forget the Communist Party when we are emancipated." Qingyu immediately adapted the struggle stories into an emancipation opera and performed it on stage. The masses said: "This is truly a complete emancipation!"
    In the large-scale liquidation movement, the leadership strongly supported the masses and made decisions for them, replacing the speculative elements and dog-leg cadres, while a large number of activists who truly served the masses were elected by the masses as struggle heroes, replacing the bad elements and taking up leadership positions; Fucheng, with more than 900 households, elected more than 130 struggle heroes. The dog-leg bad elements were also purged from the peasant association and militia, and new blood was absorbed. A large number of middle peasants, honest peasants, and women poured into the peasant association. The number of male and female members of the peasant association in Fucheng surged to more than 1,500, accounting for 40% of the village's population. In seven villages in the Third District, the number of peasant association members accounted for 66% of the total population, and in 45 villages in the Second District, it accounted for more than 40%. The militia in Fucheng surged from 50 to more than 150, almost accounting for 4% of the village's population. In the Second District, 150 people were purged and 321 were added, bringing the total to 948, accounting for 2% of the district's population.
    The masses, remembering the source of their good fortune, unanimously said: "Good times only came after the Eighth Route Army came." When distributing the fruits of struggle, some listed the families of revolutionary martyrs as the first priority, and some raised them by one level. Some paid special attention to taking care of honorably discharged soldiers. An honorably discharged soldier in Tongye Village was allocated six mu of land. (He Gaomin)

　  二十万人卷入翻身巨浪            
    安阳群运如火燎原        
    合理分配斗争果实西积善人人有地种
    【本报安阳讯】安阳新区群众的清算翻身运动，正继续猛烈的深入展开。由于各级干部坚决执行了县委决议，发动了广大中农，团结整个农民群众向封建势力进军，运动规模宏伟空前。领导上抓紧当前群众迫切要求，重新合理分配果实，从清算封建集团在八年敌伪统治下所转嫁给农民的负担，打开了运动的局面，运动如燎原烈火普遍展开。在七月一月中，新区四百二十个自然村中（对顽斗争者除外）已有三百个展开了热烈的斗争。西积善、阜城、西清流、清峪、东彰武等村运动开展得最好，连过去会门暴动时反动势力最强大的西子针村双全村都打开了局面。全县参加运动户数达百分之八十到九十，人数在二十万以上，不少群众锁了大门全家参加诉苦。在群众翻身的暴风雨冲击下，狗腿爪牙纷纷分化瓦解，过去强大的封建统治集团与特务分子遂陷于孤立，不得不被迫低头，迅速吐出赃物。许多村庄搭起凉棚开斗争大会，一片呼喊说理之声，极为紧张热烈。在运动中，贫农特别活跃，部分富农及观台煤矿工人也参加了斗争，水冶恶霸地主李晓峰的儿媳妇也去控诉他的罪行。阜城九百三十二户就有八百四十户在会上诉苦。群众忘记了饥饿和疲劳，同冶桥村一口气诉了一天一夜，天明鸡叫才散会。石涧村一连诉了三天还没有诉完，许多“老实农民”抢着倒苦水，愈“老实”倒的苦水愈多，许多村全家一齐诉，老婆婆诉着诉着就用拐杖打那些恶霸汉奸，小娃娃诉着诉着就大哭起来，向斗争对象要被逼死了的娘，群众情绪异常激愤高昂。运动结果极为良好，西积善农民已依法收回土地一千七百多亩，消灭了贫农与赤贫。群众思想觉悟已普遍提高，在去追讨赃物时都异口同声的说：“走，要咱的东西去！”阜城群众穿着地主恶霸退还的衣裳兴奋地到处扭秧歌，唱着“清算了八年血泪账，翻身不忘共产党”的翻身歌。清峪把斗争故事立即编成翻身戏登台演唱，群众说：“这才真是彻底翻了身啊！”
    在大规模清算运动中，领导上强力给群众撑腰作主，撤换了投机分子和狗腿干部，而真正为群众服务的大批积极分子，则被群众选为斗争英雄，代替坏分子站上了领导岗位；九百余户的阜城选出了斗争英雄一百三十余人。农会和民兵中也清洗了狗腿坏分子，吸收了新血液，大批中农、老实农民、妇女涌入农会。阜城男女农会员激增到一千五百余人，占全村人口百分之四十，三区七个村农会人数占全人口百分之六十六，二区四十五个村占百分之四十强。阜城民兵从五十人激增到一百五十余人，差不多占全村人口百分之四，二区清洗了一百五十名，增加了三百二十一名，连从前好的共九百四十八名，占全区人口百分之二。
    群众饮水思源，一致说：“来了八路军才来了好光景”。他们在分配斗争果实时，有的把抗属列为头等，有的提高一等。有的特别注意照顾荣退军人，同冶一荣退军人即分得了六亩地。  （何高民）
