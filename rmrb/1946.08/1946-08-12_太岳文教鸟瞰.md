　　A Bird's-Eye View of Taiyue Culture and Education
　　With the development of the Taiyue area and the deepening of the mass emancipation movement, the cultural movement in the Taiyue area has greatly developed in the past year. The emerging culture of the masses themselves has begun and is seizing the position of feudal culture, and the face of the countryside has gradually changed.
    (1) Newspapers: The circulation of the Taiyue Xinhua Daily has increased from 7,000 to 11,000 copies in the past year, of which nearly 60% are distributed to districts and villages. There are 3,200 administrative villages in the entire district, with an average of two copies of the Xinhua Daily per village. There are 2,100 newspaper reading groups in the district, and they adopt the method of mutual teaching and learning to collectively study the newspapers. Because the newspaper is more closely integrated with reality and promotes work (such as the newsletter about the emancipation of Tianshuiling, which has been discussed throughout the district and promoted the further development of the mass movement), the masses also cherish their own newspaper more. At the same time, small newspapers throughout the district have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain in the past year. Almost every county has a regular or irregular small newspaper. These are popular newspapers that reflect the struggle life of the masses, so they can gradually take root among village cadres and the masses.
    In addition, a total of 1,759 blackboards have been established in the district (that is, more than half of the administrative villages have blackboards). It is not only a "red list" for commending models and a "command platform" for promoting work, but also a question and answer office for the masses and a learning garden for the masses.
    (2) Publishing Industry: In the past year, the Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore has published and distributed a total of 324,526 copies of various books and magazines, with an average of one new book for every ten people in the district. Among them, 210,000 copies are mass reading materials, accounting for two-thirds of the total publications, and "Rural Applied Writing," "Daily Magazine," and "Literacy Textbook" sell best, with each selling 10,000 to 20,000 copies. Among the cadres' reading materials, "On the Coalition Government" is the most widely sold.
    Regular publications include the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Monthly, New Literature and Art Monthly, New Education Monthly, Digest Monthly, Economic Monthly, and Taiyue Political Report, each with a circulation of 3,000 to 7,000 copies. In addition, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sub-districts all have small lithographic printing factories. The 1st and 2nd sub-districts can each print 5,000 books per month, and the 4th sub-district can print 20,000 books per month.
    However, due to the increasing needs of the masses, the publishing industry is still in short supply. We are now trying to continue to expand it.
    (3) School Education: School education has greatly developed in the past year. There are currently 5,120 elementary schools, with an average of 1.6 per administrative village, an increase of 66% compared with 3,000 a year ago. The number of children enrolled in school is 200,000, an increase of 66% compared with 120,000 a year ago. There are currently 138 higher elementary schools, an increase of 70% compared with 80 a year ago. There are currently 13,277 students, an increase of 160% compared with 500 a year ago. There are a total of 300,000 school-age children in the district, and the number of children enrolled in school accounts for two-thirds of all school-age children.
    There are currently six middle schools in the district, an increase of two compared with a year ago. There are currently 900 students, an increase of nearly one time compared with 480 a year ago.
    The development of school education in the past year has the following characteristics:
    First, it is gradually developing in the direction of public assistance through private management. There are currently 441 private elementary schools in the district. Due to the urgent demand for children to attend school after the masses have been emancipated, or through parent meetings, or promoted by labor heroes, or promoted by model teachers, they are moving in the direction of public assistance through private management. Especially in sparsely populated areas, privately run schools are increasing day by day.
    Second, the new education policy has been implemented, the content of teaching has been changed, and whatever the masses need is taught. Generally, schools have added courses such as abacus calculation, bookkeeping, writing contracts, and opening road passes.
    Third, learning is combined with production, so a large number of out-of-school children are organized to study, and many cowherds and other poor children are organized to work and study part-time. Flexible production leave and half-day or every-other-day systems are also implemented for children in school to take care of children's family production.
    Fourth, cooperate with the central work to serve the society. For example, Li Guangjian, a model teacher in Hongtong, used the school as the center to promote production, preferential treatment for resistance against Japan, and returning to school, and transformed a backward village into a model village.
    Fifth, the number of women enrolled in school has increased. Generally, girls in schools account for one-third to one-half. There are also eight part-time women's textile schools in the district.
    (4) Rural Drama Movement Under the slogan of "mass emancipation, self-entertainment and self-singing," the rural drama movement in the Taiyue area has been unprecedentedly universally launched, and many drama troupes that are famous throughout the district have emerged. There are currently 722 rural drama troupes in the district, with 13,719 actors, 2,191 Yangko teams with 100,000 actors, and 19 drum book teams, with almost every administrative village having a mass entertainment organization. These drama troupes were mostly established during the mass emancipation movement, and they have powerfully cooperated in promoting the mass movement against traitors, evil gentry, rent reduction and debt clearing. Therefore, the rural drama movement has played an unparalleled role in promoting the peasant emancipation movement, and the vivid facts of the mass emancipation movement have provided unlimited valuable materials for the drama movement.
    The above is a bird's-eye view of the cultural movement in the Taiyue area in the past year. It has now been decided to hold a district-wide cultural work conference on August 15 to summarize past experience, determine future tasks, and establish a leading organization of the cultural circles in the district, preparing to launch a large-scale mass cultural movement this winter.

　　太岳文教鸟瞰
　　随着太岳区局面的开展，群众翻身运动的深入，一年来太岳区的文化运动已大大发展，新兴的群众自己的文化已开始并正在夺取封建文化的阵地，农村的面貌已逐渐改观。
    （一）报纸：太岳新华日报一年来由七千份增至一万一千份，其中将近百分之六十发行到区村。全区三千二百个行政村。每村平均有两份新华日报。全区有二千一百个读报组，他们采取互教互学的办法集体学习报纸。由于报纸更加结合实际，推动了工作（如天水岭翻身记的通讯，已在全区范围内展开讨论，推动了群众运动进一步深入开展）。因之群众也更加爱护自己的报纸。同时全区的小型报纸，一年来如雨后春笋般的产生，差不多每个县都有一个定期的或不定期的小报。这些都是反映群众斗争生活的通俗报，故能在村干部及群众中逐渐生根。
    另外全区共建立了一七五九块黑板报（即过半数的行政村有黑板报），它不仅是表扬模范的“红榜”，是推动工作的“点将台”，而且是群众的问事处，是群众的学习园地。
    （二）出版事业：太岳新华书店一年来出版及发行各种图书杂志共三十二万四千五百二十六册，平均全区每十个人有一本新书。其中群众读物二十一万册，占全部出版量三分之二，而以“农村应用文”“日用杂志”“识字课本”销路最好，每种销行一万至二万份。干部读物中以“论联合政府”为销行最广者。
    定期刊物现有工农兵月刊、新文艺月刊、新教育月刊、文摘月刊、经济月刊、太岳政报等种，每种发行三千至七千份。另外一、二、三、四分区都有小型的石印工厂，一、二分区每月各能印书五千册，四分区每月能印二万册。
    但由于群众需要增加，目前出版事业还是供不应求。现正设法继续扩大之。
    （三）学校教育：一年来的学校教育有很大发展，现有初小五一二○处，每个行政村平均有一·六处，较一年前的三千处增加百分之六十六。入学儿童二十万，较一年前的十二万亦增加百分之六十六。高小现有一三八所，较一年前的八十所增加百分之七十。学生现有一三二七七人，较一年前的五百人增加百分之一百六十。全区共有学龄儿童三十万，入学儿童占全部学龄儿童的三分之二。
    全区现有中学六所，较一年前增加两所。现有学生九百人，较一年前的四百八十人增加将近一倍。
    一年来学校教育的发展有这样几个特点：
    第一是逐渐向民办公助方向发展。现全区已有民办小学四百四十一处。由于群众翻身后要求子弟入学的迫切，或通过家长会议，或由劳动英雄的提倡，或由模范教员的推动而走向民办公助的方向。尤其是在人烟稀少的地区民办的学校正日益增加。
    第二是执行了新的教育方针，改变了教学的内容，作到群众需要啥就教啥。一般学校都增加了珠算、记账、写契约、开路条等课程。
    第三是学习与生产结合，从而组织了广大的校外儿童读书，将许多放牛娃及其他贫苦儿童组织起来半工半读。对校内儿童亦灵活实解放生产假，半日内隔日制，以照顾儿童家庭生产。
    第四是配合中心工作为社会服务。如洪洞模范教员李光艰以学校为中心，推动了生产、优抗、回学等工作，变落后村为模范村。
    第五是妇女入学的增多。一般学校的女生占三分之一到二分之一。全区还有八个半工半读的妇女纺织学校。
    （四）农村剧运在“群众翻身，自乐自唱”的口号下，太岳区的农村戏剧运动空前普遍开展，并已出现许多誉满全区的剧团。现全区共有农村剧团七二二个，演员一三七一九人，有秧歌队二一九一队，演员达十万人，有鼓书队十九队，将近每一个行政村有一个群众的娱乐组织。这些剧团大都是在群众翻身运动中建立的，它有力的配合推动了反奸反恶霸及减租清债的群众运动。因之农村剧运对农民翻身运动起了不可比拟的推动作用，而群众翻身运动生动的事实，又给剧运提供了无限的宝贵材料。
    以上便是太岳区一年来文化运动的鸟瞰。现已决定于八月十五日开全区文化工作会议，总结过去经验，确定今后的任务，并建立全区的文化界领导机构，准备展开今冬大规模的群众文化运动。
