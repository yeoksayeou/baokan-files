　　Jiang's Troops in Southern Shanxi Cruelly Abandon Wounded Soldiers
　　Over 300 Officers and Soldiers Rescued by Us
    Order in Hongdong City Quickly Restored
    [Telegram from the Tongpu Front, 21st] Chiang Kai-shek, apart from using lower-ranking officers and soldiers in his army for internal warfare, shows no regard for their lives and health. Recently, our Eighth Route Army rescued over 300 wounded officers and soldiers, including battalion commanders from the 91st and 92nd Regiments, who had been abandoned by the Kuomintang on the Southern Shanxi battlefield. After careful treatment by our front-line hospitals, most have now recovered. Yang Qingyun, a first-class private in the first platoon of the fourth company of the 91st Regiment of the 31st Division of the Kuomintang (from Xucheng County, Henan, wounded in the Weiqi battle in Xia County, Southern Shanxi), was so grateful when he was discharged from the hospital that he could not speak. He voluntarily initiated writing letters to his comrades remaining in the Jiang army, telling them about his feelings after arriving in the liberated area. The letter said: "I was wounded in the Weiqi battle in Xia County, and the Eighth Route Army carried me to the hospital, providing food, clothing, and bedding. The doctors treated me, and the nurses took care of me as if I were their own brothers in the Eighth Route Army. The Central Army says the Eighth Route Army kills people indiscriminately, but now I know that is false. There are also over 300 wounded battalion commanders and soldiers from our 91st and 92nd Regiments who are recovering well in the Eighth Route Army hospital. Our Central Army is fighting for Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, while the Eighth Route Army is working for the people. I think the brothers in our Central Army should revolt together and cooperate with the Eighth Route Army; only then will we have a way out."
    [Telegram from Yangcheng, 21st] Order has been quickly restored in Hongdong County after liberation, earning unanimous praise from residents, merchants, and foreign friends in the city. After our army liberated the city, a patrol team composed of cadres was immediately formed to maintain order in the city. They can stop anyone from violating discipline. Belgian Bishop Wendel and Father Ge Mulin praised our army's bravery and strict discipline. Mr. Zhang Bingxin, vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, repeatedly praised the Eighth Route Army's strict discipline, saying, "With you here, our merchants can resume business as usual." Mr. Han of Guangyuxing Western Medicine Store said, "You did not forget to protect my pharmacy during the most intense fighting; you are truly a 'benevolent army'." A resident named Zhang in Twelve Lanes borrowed a mast lamp when the Eighth Route Army entered the city and returned it the next morning. Mr. Zhang said, "How can there be such an army in the world that returns what they use?" Currently, all 120 stores in the city have resumed business. The government has allocated 3,000 piculs of grain to relieve the refugees in the city, which will be distributed soon.

　　晋南蒋军残忍抛弃伤员
　　官兵三百余被我救护       
    洪洞城内秩序迅速恢复
    【同蒲前线二十一日电】蒋介石对其军队中下级官兵，除供其内战驱使外，毫不顾惜其生命与健康。我八路军某部日前在晋南战场救护被国民党遗弃之九一、九二团营长以下三百余名伤员，经我前线医院悉心治疗，现大部均已痊愈，伤员中国民党三十一师九十一团四连一排一等兵杨清云（河南徐城县人，在晋南夏县未柒战斗中负伤），在出院时感激得说不出话来，他自动发起向留在蒋军的伙伴写信，告以到解放区后的感觉，信中说：“夏县未柒战斗时我带彩了，后经八路军把我抬到医院里，供给饮食、衣被，医生疗治，看护照料和八路军自己的弟兄一样对待。在咱中央军说八路军杀人长短，这一下可知道是假的了。还有我们九一团、九二团带彩的营长士兵三百余号人，都在八路军医院里好好的养伤。咱们中央军为蒋介石和美国打天下，八路军是为了老百姓干，我想，咱中央军的弟兄们，应该一齐起义，和八路军合作，才有咱们的活路。”
    【阳城二十一日电】解放后的洪洞县城内，秩序迅速恢复，博得城内居民商户及外国友人一致赞扬。我军解放城市后，随即由干部组成的纠察队维持城内秩序，他们可以制止任何人违犯纪律的行为。比利时籍主教文德尔，神甫葛慕霖盛赞我军英勇与纪律严明，商会副会长张炳鑫先生对八路军纪律严明再三称赞说：“你们来了，我们商户才能照常营业。”光裕兴西药房的韩先生说：“你们在战争最激烈的场合中，不忘保护我的药房，真是“仁义之师。”十二闾有个张姓居民，当八路军进城时，曾借走了一盏桅灯，天明把桅灯还来了，姓张的说：“天下那有这样的军队，用了还送回来。”现城内一百二十家商店，已全部恢复营业。政府为救济城内难民已拨粮三千石，不日即可分发。
