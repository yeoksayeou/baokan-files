　　Labor Model Zhang Jinsheng
    ——Communication from Limin Coal Mine
    Liu Zhao
    Zhang Jinsheng, with a coal-blackened, rectangular face and a bushy beard, was a tall, forty-something-year-old who, four months ago, was the living committee member of the fourth joint branch of miners in the Tongshun well of the Limin Coal Mine Company. At that time, the fourth joint branch was a very poor branch. In addition to the administrator (the old foreman), the union chairman, the production committee member, the “dagulou” (the small boss of the coal basket), and he himself, as the living committee member, still had the exploitative consciousness that was left over from being infected by the bourgeoisie. They didn't want to move themselves, didn't participate in production, and even wanted the workers to carry them, acting as parasites. Therefore, they didn't care about the organization and distribution of labor or the lives of the workers. When they went down the pit, they just wandered around and finished with a grunt or two. In the words of the production committee member, their minds were twisted, thinking, "Whether I produce more or less, I'll split a chicken leg, and I'm not afraid of not getting my share!" Although Zhang Jinsheng had worked in the Modeng coal kiln in Wuxiang in the old liberated area and knew a little about the wrongness of exploiting people, he always felt that it was an ancient rule for workers to carry the leaders, so he just followed along. Moreover, not moving and eating other people's labor made him happy. With the cadres like this, the workers below were burdened too heavily, felt uncomfortable, and lacked energy to work, so they all became passively resistant. The small boss said, "If you don't want to move, who else wants to move? We can't carry this much, we earn less, and he won't earn much more." Sometimes they would deliberately break the basket and ask the big boss to repair it for him so he could secretly loaf around.

    Those who were mining would stop if they saw hard coal, and sometimes deliberately hacked at the hard coal, breaking the pickaxe tip in a couple of strokes. This was good: "You rest, let's rest too!"

    Those pushing the carts would rest even if there were no carts to push and wouldn't look for them. If you didn't urge him, he wouldn't come down after going up to find a cart.

    Therefore, in April, both coal production and wages lagged far behind other branches.

    At the beginning of April, the trade union started a training class in preparation for the Red May Great Production Campaign. Zhang Jinsheng was also transferred to receive training. After studying for more than ten days, Zhang Jinsheng came back with a new mindset. He understood that the poverty and suffering of workers and peasants were due to the bad system of the old society, with the oppression and exploitation of landlords and capitalists. He no longer believed in "poverty and wealth are determined by fate, if you have fate, you will have good fortune.” He completely agreed with, "Only labor can provide food; no labor, no food.” In particular, the speech of the union’s director Duo reminded him: "Chairman Mao's slogan is 'Serve the people,' and the trade union is to serve the workers, to be a logistics worker for the workers."

    At the same time, the school also proposed to ensure the Great Production Campaign in May and play a leading role in the Great Production Campaign. This touched him deeply, and he decided to transform himself, work hard on production when he returned, and strive to become a model.

    As soon as he came back, he stopped asking the workers to carry him and participated in production himself. He also automatically returned the fire fee that he had misappropriated. This influenced the other cadres. Seeing that he was different from before, everyone supported him. During the branch re-election, he was elected as the director of the fourth joint branch. He was a "white collar" and afraid that others would look down on him, thinking he couldn't push. Therefore, he decided to unite with the workers, humbly learn from the "black collars," and lead everyone to work. First, he talked to the cadres individually: "To respond to the company's call and do a good job in the Great Production Campaign in May, the cadres must play a model role, participate in labor, and not ask the workers to carry them in order to make everyone have the energy to work." Then he held a cadres' meeting to review and deploy the Great Production Campaign in Red May. They reviewed that the main reasons for the poor production in the past were: First, the cadres were irresponsible and did not participate in labor themselves, only asking the workers to carry them, which greatly affected the workers' enthusiasm for production. Therefore, it was decided that all cadres should participate in labor and not allow carrying. Second, the labor allocation was inappropriate, and a lot of manpower was wasted in many places, such as the hauling of coal baskets. In the past, they were not distributed according to needs, with as many people hauling as needed. Therefore, they decided to allocate them according to the labor intensity of coal mining and the distance. For example, for distances as far as sixty or seventy meters, strong laborers could be equipped with one and a half coal baskets per person. For distances as close as twenty or thirty meters, two people could be equipped with one basket. The loading of the carts originally required two people, plus one person to handle the dustpan. They studied the possibility of pouring the coal baskets directly into the carts without using the dustpan, which would save one person to mine coal. Originally, there were three people pushing the carts. It was decided to have the pusher coordinate well with the cart carrier and the hooker to reduce one pusher and increase coal production. After this opinion was conveyed to all members of the joint branch, everyone was enthusiastic after seeing that the cadres did not ask to be carried and were willing to work in the same way, and they unanimously passed the plan and discipline for the Great Production Campaign in May: "Everyone must improve, and anyone who slacks off will be fined one day's work. The coal miners, coal haulers, loaders, and pushers must all ensure the coal is extracted."

    Some people in the third branch still held the old idea that "whether you move or not, you still earn the same two coins." At the same time, they were afraid of change. Some were afraid that if production was increased, the Eighth Route Army would keep asking for that much and not lower it, and they would suffer. This thinking hindered production. Zhang Jinsheng seized on this harmful idea and timely explained and persuaded everyone. He used the workers' own eyes on the Ping-Han Campaign as an analogy to make everyone believe in the strength of the Eighth Route Army and the people, that the situation would only get better, not worse. He also contrasted the lives of workers under the rule of the Kuomintang and the enemy with the lives of workers in the liberated areas now. In the past, they were beaten and scolded every day, and they couldn't even eat their fill of soybean cakes. Now, they eat white flour every day, showing that the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the democratic government truly work for the people and for the interests of the working class. If the Kuomintang comes to attack, we can only work harder to help the army defend the liberated areas, which is also defending ourselves. In this way, he eliminated doubts and boosted everyone's enthusiasm for production. Later, it was discovered that the person spreading such bad words was You Junde, who was secretly working hard at coal mining, and his output was much higher than in April. Zhang Jinsheng asked him well, and he said, "I was afraid that others would mine too much, and I wouldn't become a model, so I wanted others to mine less!" Zhang Jinsheng immediately told him: "If everyone produces more coal, the company earns money, and everyone's lives will improve. If everyone produces less coal, the company loses money, and everyone will have no food to eat. If everyone is doing badly, one person can't do well. What good is it for you to produce a few more tons of coal alone?!" In this way, he cleared You Junde's thinking and made everyone's production enthusiasm fiery.

    But then he encountered another unpleasant incident: Cao Luo, the production committee member who had been voted out, had not yet changed his mind. He didn't want to work himself, and he wasn't willing to participate in coal mining. He was always lazy and sleeping, affecting others. Zhang Jinsheng talked to him and criticized him, but he ignored him. Finally, he held a branch meeting to review, and everyone said, "According to the discipline, fine him one day's work." But Zhang Jinsheng disagreed. He believed that to encourage labor, there should only be "more work, more pay, less work, less pay." He tried his best to persuade everyone that as long as he accepted his mistakes and changed, that would be enough. In the future, it should be implemented that whoever works more gets more, and whoever works less gets less. From this, he came up with the method of scoring labor every day.

    Every shift records the amount of coal mined by each miner, as well as the performance of hauling coal baskets, pushing carts, and the carpenter using wood. It is settled every half month, and the wages are combined and scored according to the average amount of coal produced by each person. In this way, everyone is willing to produce more coal and get more points and wages. No one wants to slack off and delay coal production, and everyone supervises each other, which invisibly improves the enthusiasm for production competition.

    Zhang Jinsheng goes down to the pit half an hour early every day to check the location, allocate labor, and supervise at any time. He also directly leads the third branch and participates in labor himself. Although he is a "white collar," he mines one to one and a half carts every day, no less than the average "black collar," and he goes to work wherever there is a shortage of people. Half an hour before the end of work, he tells the coal miners to repair the mined tunnels in preparation for handing over the shift. When work is over, he gathers everyone together below to calculate the scores. First, he calculates how much coal has been loaded (one cart per ton), then the coal baskets, and then the coal miners, to get the total amount of coal produced, and then goes up to the wellhead to reconcile the accounts.

    Because Zhang Jinsheng changed his own mind, promoted the transformation of general cadres, appropriately organized labor, created a scoring method, improved production enthusiasm, grasped and solved the ideological problems of the masses, and completed the Great Production Campaign in May, he was elected as a special-class labor model at the Heroes Conference of the entire Limin mining area in June. The fourth joint branch he led became the model joint branch of Tongshun Well.

　　劳动模范张金生
    ——利民煤矿通讯
    刘昭
    煤黑的长方脸上长着络腮胡子，四十来岁，高个儿的张金生，四月前是利民煤矿公司通顺井矿工第四联合支部的生活委员，那时候，四联支是很不好的支部，除了管理员（旧的包工头）外，当干部的工会主任、生产委员、大鼓篓（拉煤篓的小头），以及当生活委员的他自己，受资产阶级传染的剥削意识，还残留在他们脑子里作怪，自己不想动，不参加生产，还要工人给他们抬工，当寄生虫，因此对劳力的组织分配和工友的生活不关心，下坑去只是游逛游逛，唔叫唔叫就完了。照生产委员的话，他们的脑子是扭着一股筋“出多出少我劈一个鸡腿，还怕没有我一份？”张金生虽然曾在老解放区武乡的墨灯煤窑里干过，多少知道点剥削人有些不对，但总觉得工人给当领头的抬工是古来的规矩，跟着走就得了；而且不动弹，吃别人，心里也是乐意的。干部是这样，下面工友们背工太大，心里不痛快，干活没劲头，都消极怠工起来。小鼓篓说：“你不想动弹，谁还想动弹？背这样多工，咱背不起，咱赚少了，他也多不了”，有时故意把鼓篓弄坏，要大鼓篓给他修理，他好在一旁偷偷懒。
    刨镢看的到煤硬便不想刨，有时故意在硬煤上乱掘，一两下把镐尖给你搞断了，这就好：“你歇着，咱也歇歇吧！”
    推罐的没罐也歇着不去找，你唔叫他，他上去找罐就不再下来。
    因此在四月份出炭和工资都远远的落在别的支部后面。
    四月头上，工会因为准备红五月大生产，开办了训练班。张金生也被调去受训，学习了十多天，张金生回来就换了一个新脑筋。他明白了工人农人受穷受苦是旧社会的制度不好，有地主资本家的压迫和剥削，他再不相信什么“穷富由命，有命就有福”，他完全赞成：“劳动才有饭吃，不劳动就没饭吃”，特别是职工会多主任的讲话提醒了他：“毛主席的口号是‘为群众服务’，工会就是为工人服务的，要给工人当勤务员”。
    同时，学校还提出要保证五月大生产，在大生产中起领头作用，这很打动了他，他决心转变，回来好好搞生产，争取模范。
    他一回来就不教工人抬工，自己下窑参加生产，还把分吞的火夫费，自动退出来，这影响到其它的干部。大家看到他和以前不同了，都赞成他，在分会改选时，他被选为第四联合支部的主任。他是个“白脖”怕别人瞧不起，推不动，于是决心团结工友，向“黑脖”虚心学习，领着大家干。首先他找干部个别谈：“要响应公司号召，把五月大生产搞好，干部就得起模范作用，参加劳动，不教工人抬工，才能使大伙有劲头干活”，然后开干部会来检讨布置红五月的大生产。他们检讨出：过去生产搞不好的原因主要的是：第一、干部不负责任，不亲自参加劳动，只教工人抬工，大大地影响了工友们的生产热忱；于是决定干部全体参加劳动，不许抬工。第二、劳动配备不适当，好多地方浪费了劳力，如像拉鼓篓的以前不按需要分配，下几个就拉几个；于是他们决定要按刨煤的劳动强度和距离远近来分配，如像远到六七十米达，劳动力强的就可以一个＠配上一个到一个半鼓篓；近到二三十米达的，两个＠配一个鼓篓就行了。装罐的原来是两个人，还有一个拨落簸箕的；他们研究出可以将拉煤的鼓篓直接向罐里倒，不用簸箕，就可以节省一人去创煤，推罐的原来三人，决定让推罐带罐与登钩的很好联系互助，减少一个推罐的去刨＠，增加出煤，这个意见传给了全联支的成员之后，大家看到干部不教抬工，要一样劳动，还提出了好办法，都热烈赞成，并一致通过了五月大生产的计划和纪律：“大家都要变好，谁要偷懒，罚一个工，刨＠的刨多少，拉鼓篓，装推罐的保证都要拉出来。”
    三支部有些人还抱着，“动弹不动弹还不是一样的赚你这两个钱”的旧脑筋，同时，还怕变天，有些怕提高了生产，八路军就一直向你要这样多，降不下来，自己吃亏，这思想障碍了生产。张金生抓紧这种有害的想法，及时向大家解释说服，拿工人亲眼看到的平汉战役来比喻，让大家相信八路军和人民的力量，天只有变好，不会变坏，又把国民党与敌人统治时的工人生活和解放区工人现在的生活来对比，以前每天挨打挨骂，吃豆饼吃不饱，现在每天吃白面，说明共产党八路军与民主政府真正是一切为着人民，也为着工人阶级谋利益，国民党要来进攻，我们只有更努力生产来帮助军队保卫解放区，也就是保卫自己。这样才消除怀疑鼓起了大家的生产热情。以后发现说这样坏话的正是背地努力刨煤，产量比四月份增高很多的犹俊德。张金生很好地问他，他才说：“怕别人刨多了自己当不成模范，所以我要别人少刨！”张金生马上告诉他：“大家出煤多，公司赚了钱，大家生活改善才有办法；大家出煤少，公司赔了本，大家也会没饭吃，大家坏了，一人好不了，光你一人多出几吨煤顶啥用！？”这样打通了犹俊德的思想，把大家的生产情绪也搞得火热起来。
    可是又遇到了一件不顺当的事：被选掉了的生产委员曹珞脑筋还没转过来，要自己劳动，心里不愿意，参加刨＠，总是不好好刨，偷懒睡睡觉，影响别人，张金生和他谈，批评他，都不理会，最后开支部大会检讨，大家说：“按照纪律，罚他一个工”。但是张金生不同意，他认为，要鼓励劳动只有“多劳多得，少劳少得”，他尽力说服大家，只要他接受错误转变就行了。今后应该实行谁劳动得多多得，谁劳动得少少得，从这里他就想出了每天按劳动记分的办法。
    每一班都记上各个老＠的创煤数，以及拉鼓篓，推罐和木匠使木头的成绩，每半月结算一次，按每个人出煤的平均数计分合工资，这样谁也愿意多出煤，多得分，多得工资，谁偷懒耽误了出煤，大伙儿都不愿意，互相督促，无形中就提高了生产竞赛的热忱。
    张金生每天早半点下坑看地点，分配劳力，随时检查督促，还直接领导三支部，亲自参加劳动。他虽是个“白脖”但他每天刨一罐到一罐半，并不比一般“黑脖”少，还要那儿紧缺人，就那儿干，到收工前半点就告刨＠的修好刨的坑道，准备交班，收工时就在下面集合大家在一起算分，先算装罐多少（一罐一吨），后算鼓篓，再算刨＠的，得出出煤总数，上来再到井口对赈。
    因为张金生自己换了脑筋，推动了一般干部的转变，适当的组织了劳动，创造了记分的办法，提高了生产热情，掌握与解决了群众的思想问题，完成了五月大生产任务，六月在利民全矿区的群英大会上被选为特等劳动模范，他领导的第四联合支部成了通顺井的模范联合支部。
