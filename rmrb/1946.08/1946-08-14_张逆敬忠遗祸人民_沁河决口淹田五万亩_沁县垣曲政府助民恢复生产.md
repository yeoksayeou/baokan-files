　　Traitor Zhang Jingzhong's Legacy Harms the People
　　Qin River Breach Floods 50,000 Mu of Farmland
　　Qin County and Yuanqu County Governments Help People Restore Production
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Jiaozuo] In mid-July, continuous rain caused the Qin River to breach at Wuchekou in Wuzhi County, flooding over 50,000 mu of fertile land between the Qin River and the Yellow River. Over fifty towns and villages were turned into a watery expanse. Although the floodwaters have receded, the autumn harvest is entirely lost. The Fourth Administrative Office of the Taihang Region and the Wuzhi County Government have dispatched personnel with grain to the disaster area for emergency relief and to survey the damage at Wuchekou. It is reported that Wuchekou was deliberately breached by Kuomintang's Fourth District Commissioner, traitor Zhang Jingzhong, on June 22nd of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), causing floods to overflow from this point every year. Since this spring, our government has been planning to repair the Wuchekou project for several months, starting construction several times, but all were halted midway due to harassment by stubborn enemy troops on the opposite bank. In May, the county requested the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to assist in the damming project. UNRRA sent personnel to survey the area, but they were also met with gunfire from the Kuomintang troops on the opposite bank and were prevented from proceeding, leading to this calamity for the people of Qinnan. The local people deeply hate Zhang's breaching of the dyke and the enemy's sabotage of the damming efforts. They have issued a circular telegram, appealing to the entire country to denounce the crimes of traitor Zhang Jingzhong, requesting support from all areas, and demanding that the Kuomintang troops withdraw from the Wuchekou sentry posts to facilitate the repair of the river embankment. In view of the severe disaster caused by the Qin River breach, the Fourth Administrative Office has telegraphed the Administrative Office of the Border Region, requesting full regional cooperation in providing relief. In addition to allocating 100 shi of grain for emergency relief, the County Government is actively seeking loans and organizing production for self-salvation, ensuring that no one starves to death. Production self-salvation committees have been established in various districts, and they are studying various specific methods for production self-salvation. The masses in the disaster area are deeply grateful for this benefit and are extremely moved, believing that "under the leadership of the democratic government, we will definitely be able to overcome the disaster."
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Yangcheng] Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yuanqu County had six coal mines in Shigou, Wulongmiao, Wenjiawan, Yanweigou, Jieyu, and Dundixia, which could have supplied five-thirds of the county's fuel. However, they were all shut down due to the brutal destruction by the enemy and puppet regimes for several years, leading to extreme fuel shortages among the people. As a result, 90% of the trees and most of the houses in the county were felled and destroyed to be used as fuel. After our army recovered Yuanqu, the democratic government immediately supported the people in restoring the coal industry. Currently, the Limin, Minli, and Minxing coal mines have been restored, with a daily output of 53,000 catties, solving part of the fuel problem. Restoration efforts are continuing.
　　[Yangcheng, 10th] After the liberation of Qin County, the democratic government is actively carrying out post-disaster recovery work. The Taiyue Administrative Office has allocated 12,000 catties of grain for emergency relief. The people in the old liberated areas of the county have spontaneously launched a mutual assistance and mutual relief campaign. The liberated villages and towns are brewing struggles to overturn the old order, denounce grievances, and combat traitors. All farmers are seizing the time to rush to sow seeds, and young and middle-aged men are demolishing enemy and puppet fortifications, tidying up their homes, and restoring cultivated land.
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Changzhi] After the second liberation of Changning Town in Yuci on June 17th, after more than a month of efforts by the local government and the masses, more than 30 hectares of wasteland have been transformed into fertile fields with flourishing seedlings. The town is mostly wetland, rich in cotton and tobacco, but because the Yan Xishan puppet army forced the masses to transport bricks to the Yuanwo Station on the Zhengtai Railway every day during their occupation, they missed the farming season, and no planting had been done by the time of liberation. After our army liberated the town for the second time, it fully organized the masses to replant. In addition to all the full and semi-labor force of the entire village being put into production, 200 head of livestock were drawn from the old liberated areas to sell their labor to support the effort. It rained heavily on the 20th of last month, and another batch of late crops was rushed to be planted, completely eliminating the wasteland. The masses reflected that without the leadership of the democratic government, they would only starve to death after the autumn harvest this year.

　　张逆敬忠遗祸人民            
    沁河决口淹田五万亩           
    沁县垣曲政府助民恢复生产
    【本报焦作讯】七月中旬连日阴雨，沁河于武陟县之五车口决口，沁河与黄河之间五万余亩良田全被淹没，五十余个镇尽成泽国。现洪水虽退，秋禾已全部无望。太行四专署与武陟县府已派员携带粮食赶赴灾区急赈，并勘察五车口冲决情况。按五车口于民国三十二年六月二十二日为国民党第四专员张逆敬忠所决开，年年洪水必由此处漫流。今春以来我政府为修复五车口工程筹划数月，几次兴工，均为对岸顽军袭扰中途停止。五月该县要求联总协助堵口工程，联总派员勘察，亦遭对岸国民党军开枪射击，被阻未果，致使沁南人民遭此奇祸。当地人民对张逆决堤与顽军破坏堵口极为痛恨，已发出通电，向全国控诉张逆敬忠的罪恶，要求各地声援，要求国民党军队撤退五车口岗哨，以利修堵河堤。四专署鉴于此次沁河灾情惨重，特电行署边府，要求全区协力救济。该县府除拨粮一百石急赈救济外，并积极设法贷款，组织生产自救，不让饿死一个人。各区建立了生产自救委员会，正研究各种具体生产自救办法。灾区群众躬受此惠，感愤异常，认为“在民主政府领导下，一定能胜利的渡过灾荒”。
    【本报阳城讯】抗战前垣曲县有柿沟、五龙庙、文家湾、燕尾沟、解峪、墩底下等六座煤窑，本可供全县五分之三的燃料。但在敌伪的数年残酷摧残下全部停工，民间燃料极度恐慌，因此全县百分之九十的树木及大部民房被砍伐、折毁充当燃料。我军收复垣曲后，民主政府立即扶植民众恢复煤业，现已恢复利民，民立、民兴三座煤窑，日产量五万三千斤，解决了一部分燃料问题。现仍在继续恢复中。
    【阳城十日电】沁县解放后，民主政府正积极进行善后恢复工作，太岳行署已拨粮一万二千斤，施行急赈，全县老解放区人民自动发起互助互济运动，解放了的村庄城镇正酝酿翻身诉苦反奸斗争，全体农民争取时间突击播种，青壮丁纷纷平毁敌伪工事，整理自己家园，恢复耕地。
    【本报长治讯】榆次长凝镇在六月十七日二次解放后，经过当地政府群众一个多月的努力，已将三十多顷荒地变为绿苗繁茂的良田，该镇多为水地，盛产棉花烟叶，但因阎伪军盘踞时每日强迫群众至正太路源涡车站运砖，误了农时，至解放时仍未下种。我军二次解放该镇后，即全力组织群众补种。除全村全半劳力全部投入生产外，并由老区抽二百犋牲口前往卖工支援，上月二十日落了透雨，又抢种晚庄稼一批，荒地始完全消灭。群众反映不是民主政府领导，则今年秋后只有饿死。
