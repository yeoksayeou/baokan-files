[Yangcheng, 6th dispatch] After our troops recovered Yanzhang, Ru Yi Shang Chao, Xia Chao and other villages in Wenxi, local people wept and complained to the democratic government about the atrocities of Chiang's troops, saying that their rape, looting, and killing were several times more vicious than the Japanese devils. In Xia Chao village, Chiang's troops falsely accused villagers Zhang Tianshe and his mother as "bandits" and sentenced them to execution by firing squad. Eighteen-year-old woman Han Luanxin was raped and then had her abdomen pierced with a bayonet, and her fetus was removed. Fortunately, she did not die. While complaining, Han Luanxin's wounds were covered with flies. She painfully requested that justice be served and revenge be taken for her. A pregnant woman in Dabang village suffered the same misfortune as Han Luanxin and also had her ears and breasts cut off. In Yaocun, Jilu, the 233rd Regiment of Chiang's troops locked all the women in the village in one place and raped them wantonly. The men were locked in a cave, and bombs were dropped from the chimney, killing eight people and injuring more than twenty. They also lied and said that the shells were fired by the Eighth Route Army. In addition to killing people, they also looted materials. In Yanzhang town alone, they robbed more than 100 large carts of goods worth more than 100 million yuan.

    奸后剖腹挖胎少妇抚伤控诉
    【阳城六日电】闻喜堰掌、如意上晁、下晁等村，被我军恢复后，当地百姓痛哭流涕向民主政府控诉蒋军暴行，说他们奸淫抢杀实在比日本鬼子还凶狠几倍。蒋军在下晁村，诬赖村民张天赦母子为“匪军”而判处枪决。十八岁的妇女韩鸾新被强奸后又用枪刺穿破肚皮挖出胎儿，幸未致死，韩鸾新控诉时苍蝇还爬满伤口，她痛苦地请求替她伸冤复仇。大磅村的一个孕妇也遭到和韩鸾新同样的不幸，还被割去两耳两乳。在稷麓姚村，蒋军二三三团，把全村女人关在一处大肆奸淫，男人另关在一个窑洞内，从烟囱中丢下炸弹，结果炸死八人，伤二十余人，还撒谎说是八路军打来的炮弹。除了杀人外他们还抢掠物资，仅在堰掌镇，就抢去了一百多辆大车价值一万万元以上的东西。
