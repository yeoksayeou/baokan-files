　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 14th: Cotton fields in the liberated areas on both sides of the Pinghan Railway are lush, and a bumper harvest is expected. The cotton planting area this year exceeds previous years. This year, 3 million mu of cotton were planted in central Hebei, doubling the amount from last year. In ten counties in western Hebei, including Yi County and Mancheng, a total of 400,000 mu of cotton were planted; Mancheng County alone planted over 10,000 mu, accounting for 20% of the county's cultivated land. Yi County has over 66,000 mu of cotton fields, accounting for 13% of the cultivated land. In addition, the rainfall has been suitable this year in various places, and the cotton bolls have already bloomed vigorously, providing sufficient raw materials for the folk textile industry.
    Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 15th: Kedong, Baiquan, and Keshan counties in Heilongjiang Province, known as the granary of northern Manchuria, are expected to have a bumper harvest this year due to favorable weather conditions. Taking Qianfeng District in Kedong as an example, it has recently received continuous rain, the wheat ears are plump, the wheat grains are firm, and harvesting is imminent. According to experienced farmers, each qing (equivalent to 10 mu) of wheat can yield more than four shi this year; millet and broomcorn millet yielded about one shi per qing last year, and this year at least three shi can be harvested; corn can yield five shi even on ordinary land this year; potatoes yielded no harvest last year, and this year each qing can yield 12,000 jin (20 shi). In the vast fields of northern Manchuria, which were liberated not long ago, the wheat ears are plump, soybeans have partially blossomed, corn has grown red tassels, and broomcorn millet is also more than two chi tall. Looking around, there is a scene of joy. The farmers are all delighted and say: "Since the establishment of the democratic government, all exorbitant taxes and levies have been abolished, and the bandits within the territory have been completely eliminated by the Democratic Allied Army. We have all been allocated the land of the enemy and puppets, and it is also a bumper year. We can have a 90% harvest, and every family can have surplus grain. We can have a good life this year."

　　平汉两侧棉桃怒放黑龙江克东兆丰收
    【新华社张家口十四日电】平汉路两侧解放区棉田茂盛，丰收可望，今年植棉面积超过往年。冀中今年植棉三百万亩，较去年增加一倍。冀西易县、满城等十县植棉共四十万亩；满城一县万余亩，占全县耕地面积百分之二十。易县有棉田六万六千余亩，占耕地面积百分之十三。加以今年各地雨水适调，棉桃均已怒放，民间纺织业将有足够之原料供给。
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十五日电】被称为北满谷仓之黑龙江省的克东、拜泉、克山三县，今年风调雨顺可望丰收。以克东乾丰区为例，最近连获甘霖，麦穗肥大，麦粒结实即将收割。据一般有经验农民估计：今年每垧（合十亩）麦子可收四石以上；谷子和糜子去年每垧收一石左右，今年最少可收三石，包谷今年平常地亦可收五石；土豆子去年颗粒未收，今年每垧可收一万二千斤（二十石）。解放不久的北满广阔田野，麦子穗肥大，大豆已部分开花，包谷出红须，糜子亦有二尺多高，展目四望一片喜色。农民都欣喜的说：“民主政府建立以来，就取消了一切苛捐杂税，境内胡匪已被民主联军全部肃清，我们都分得了敌伪土地，又是丰年，可有九成收成，家家能有余粮，今年日子可过好了。”
