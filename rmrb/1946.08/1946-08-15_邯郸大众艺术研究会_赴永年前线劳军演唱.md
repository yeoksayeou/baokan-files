　　Handan Mass Art Research Association
　　Performs to Comfort Troops at the Yongnian Frontline
　　[Our Correspondent in Handan] Mr. Wang Taixiang, vice president of the Handan Mass Art Research Association, along with a group of nine men and women, departed from Handan City on July 20th to perform for the troops at the Yongnian front. Braving the danger of bombing and strafing by Kuomintang planes, they toured the villages of Nanyan, Jiema Zhuang, and two other villages on the south, east, and north sides of Yongnian City, performing for eleven days. They returned to Handan on the 30th. In those eleven days, they performed more than twenty times, each time with two to three hundred soldiers and civilians in the audience, sometimes as many as six to seven hundred. During the performance at Jiema Zhuang, it happened that the Second Battalion of a certain regiment was withdrawn from the front line for rest. All the soldiers participated in listening to the storytelling. After listening, the soldiers' spirits were greatly uplifted. They all voluntarily gave up the opportunity to rest, shouting that they wanted to return to the front line to eliminate the puppet troops.

    赴永年前线劳军演唱
    【本报邯郸讯】本市大众艺术研究会副会长王太祥男女一行等九人，于七月二十日自邯市出发，赴永年前线举行劳军演唱。他们冒着国民党飞机轰炸扫射的危险，先后在永年城南、东、北三面的南沿村，借马庄等四个村庄巡回表演了十一天。于三十日返回邯郸，十一天中共演唱了二十余次，每次都有军民听众二三百，有时多至六七百人，在借马庄演唱时，适有某团第二营从前线调回休息，全体战士参加听书，听过后，战士们精神大为振奋，全体自愿放弃休息机会，高喊着要回到前线消灭伪军去。
