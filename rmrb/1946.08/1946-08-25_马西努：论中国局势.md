　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Moscow Radio commentator Masinu, in a commentary on the situation in China, stated: The victory of the Anti-Japanese War did not bring peace to the Chinese people. The past year has been one in which Chinese reactionaries, with the help of the United States, provoked civil war and opposed democratic forces. Chinese democrats point out that Chiang Kai-shek's recent speech is a final ultimatum for peace. He shifts all responsibility to the Communist Party and deliberately raises various unreasonable demands in order to push the situation to a breaking point. Regarding the opinions of Chinese democrats on disarming the Communist armed forces, Luo Longji, a leader of the Democratic League, said, "Disarming the CCP is impossible, because without armed forces there is no guarantee for the existence of democratic parties. Under these circumstances, two members of the Democratic League have already been assassinated, and one has been kidnapped in Beiping. But if the reactionaries run rampant, then the matter will not be limited to assassinations but will completely eliminate all democratic forces. If there were no People's Revolutionary Army, then the entire democratic force would have been completely extinguished a year ago. Therefore, the existence of the People's Revolutionary Army is a guarantee for the existence and development of democratic forces in China." Masinu stated: In the past year, the reactionaries have tried more than once to realize their plan to eliminate democratic forces. Only the victory of the People's Revolutionary Army's self-defense war and the uprising of Kuomintang troops such as Gao Shuxun and Hao Pengju forced the reactionaries to sign the ceasefire order and resume negotiations. But this was only the reactionaries buying time to prepare for a new offensive. Masinu continued: The failure of the reactionaries in the civil war has caused anxiety among international reactionaries, so the United States is very concerned about the Chinese civil war. Last October, the US Marines landed in North China with the help of the Japanese army, and the US military began to join the Chinese civil war. The US military, taking advantage of the People's Revolutionary Army's attitude of avoiding conflict with the US military, entered the liberated areas and continuously shipped Kuomintang troops and weapons by ships and airplanes to attack the People's Revolutionary Army. And after each time the Kuomintang army suffered a serious defeat, Marshall would come to carry out their so-called "mediation" activities. During the "mediation," the United States continued to transport Kuomintang troops to the front line to prepare for a new offensive. But just like in the national liberation war, a movement to strive for unity with the People's Revolutionary Army to resist Japan unfolded in the Kuomintang army, thus giving rise to the anti-Japanese allied forces. Now, during the civil war, a force to strive for unity with the People's Revolutionary Army to oppose the civil war and fight for peace and democracy has unfolded in the Kuomintang army. A patriotic movement of national unity was generated on a democratic basis. This democratic national united front was further consolidated and expanded in July. In the entire month of July, the Kuomintang army lost 53,000 men (Note: Actually 70,000 men). Not only did it not achieve the goal of eliminating the New Fourth Army, but the People's Revolutionary Army's strength was further supplemented and developed due to the defection of Kuomintang officers and soldiers. And the speeches of Soong Ching Ling, He Xiangning, and other progressive figures of the Kuomintang show the expansion of this force against the civil war and demanding democracy. But with the support of the American reactionaries, the reactionaries continue to provoke civil war. After bombing Yan'an, Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech ten days later. Chinese democrats believe that this speech is preparing public opinion for a full-scale civil war. The day after Chiang's speech, Kuomintang planes bombed Zhangjiakou and Yanggao stations. Soong Ching Ling declared that the Chinese and American reactionaries are cooperating and encouraging each other in provoking civil war; this encouragement has been particularly strengthened in late July and early August. On the eve of the bombing of Yan'an, there was a conflict between the US military and the People's Army in North China (Note: namely the Anping Incident). On the eve of Chiang Kai-shek's speech, Marshall and Stuart issued a joint statement stating that "mediation" had failed. The US State Department also stated that the US policy towards China remains unchanged. The US military is still stationed in China, although the work of sending back Japanese troops was completed on July 15. Masinu concluded that: In the past year, the reactionaries have not realized their plan for a full-scale civil war. Chinese democrats believe that this is mainly due to the strong strength of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Army it leads. The continued unity of democratic forces in China and the continued consolidation and expansion of the national united front make it possible for the Chinese people to overcome the long-delayed full-scale civil war.

　　马西努：论中国局势
    【新华社延安二十二日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努论中国局势称：抗日胜利没有给中国人民带来和平，过去一年是中国反动分子在美国帮助之下挑起内战，反对民主力量的一年。中国民主人士指出蒋介石最近的讲演是对和平的最后通牒。他把一切应负的责任都推到共产党身上，故意提出种种无理的要求，以使局势达到决裂。中国民主人士关于解除共产党武装力量的意见，民盟领袖罗隆基关于这点说：“解除中共武装是不可能的，因为没有武装就没有民主政党的存在保障。在这种情形下，民盟即已有两位委员被暗杀，一位在北平被绑架。可是如果反动分子横行起来，那末事情就不仅限于暗杀而是会完全消灭一切民主力量。如果没有人民革命军，那末整个民主力量还在一年前就被完全扑灭了。因此人民革命军的存在是中国民主力量存在与发展的保障。”马西努称：过去一年间反动派不止一次企图实现其消灭民主力量的计划，只是由于人民革命军自卫战的胜利与国民党军队如高树勋、郝鹏举等的起义，才迫使反动派签字于停战令与恢复谈判。可是这只是反动派争取时间准备新的进攻而已。马西努继称：在内战中反动派的失败引起国际反动派的不安，因此美国对于中国内战就非常关心。去年十月美国海军陆战队在日军帮助下在华北登陆，美军便开始加入了中国的内战。美军利用人民革命军避免与美军冲突的态度进入解放区，用舰只与飞机不断装运国民党军队与武器去进攻人民革命军，而在每次国民党军遭受到严重失败之后，马歇尔就来干他们所谓“调停”的活动了。在“调停”中，美国又继续运国民党军到前线，准备新的进攻。可是正像在民族解放战争中，在国民党军队中曾展开争取与人民革命军联合抗日的运动，因而产生了民族抗日的联军。现在在内战时期，在国民党军队中又展开了争取与人民革命军联合反对内战建立为和平民主而奋斗的力量。在民主基础上产生了民族团结的爱国运动。这种民主民族统一战线在七月份是更加巩固与扩大了，七月整月的战争中，国民党军队损失了五万三千人（按：实际为七万人）。它不但没有达到消灭新四军的目的，反而由于国民党军队官兵的投诚，更加补充与发展了人民革命军的力量。而宋庆龄、何香凝及国民党其他进步人士的言论，更可以看出这种反对内战要求民主力量的扩大。可是在美国反动派支持之下，反动派继续挑拨内战，轰炸延安之后，经过十天，蒋介石便发表了演说。中国民主人士认为：这种演说是准备社会舆论以便进行全国内战。蒋演说的第二天，国民党飞机就轰炸了张家口与阳高车站。宋庆龄声明说，中美反动派在挑拨内战上互相合作彼此鼓励；这种鼓励在七月底八月初已特别加强。轰炸延安的前夜发生了美军在华北与人民军的冲突事件（按：即安平事件）。蒋介石演说前夜，马、司发表了联合声明，说明“调停”失败。美国务院也声明说美对华政策不变。美军仍驻在中国，虽然遣送日军的工作已在七月十五日完成了。马西努结论称：过去的一年，反动派并没有实现其全面内战的计划，中国民主人士认为这主要应归功于中国共产党及其领导的人民军具有强大的力量。中国民主力量的继续团结，民族统一战线继续巩固与扩大，使得中国人民有可能克服拖延很久的全面内战。
