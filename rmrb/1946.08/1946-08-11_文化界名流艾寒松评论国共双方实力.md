Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Ai Hansong, a famous figure in Shanghai's cultural circles (the author of the article "Idle Talk About the Emperor" in the "New Life" weekly magazine incident in 1935), recently wrote an article commenting on the strengths of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, stating: "The National Army is said to have four million men, which is more than the Communist Army, but the National Army is openly paid, and the actual number is often seventy percent, or even half. The Communist Army had 1.2 million regular troops and 2 million militia six months ago, which is the actual number, and is no less than the National Army. The National Army generals are too corrupt, mostly greedy for life and afraid of death, and the soldiers are too miserable and want to retire and return home. With such morale, if they are driven to fight a civil war, they will inevitably follow the 184th Division and oppose the war." Ai also said: "The National Army is most proud of its new weapons equipped by the United States and a large number of officers trained by the United States, but in the Battle of Siping Street, the Democratic Allied Army was able to persist for 34 days, which shows that weapons and trained officers are not overwhelming."

　　文化界名流艾寒松评论国共双方实力
　　【新华社延安七日电】沪文化界名流艾寒松（一九三五年《新生》周刊事件中《闲话皇帝》一文的作者）近著文评论国共双方的实力称：“国军号称四百几十万人，虽较共军为多，然国军向系公开吃饷，实数多则对七成，少则对折。共军在半年前已有正规军一百二十万人，民兵二百万人，是其实数，并不少于国军。国军将官实则太腐败，多是贪生怕死，士兵实在太苦，均欲退伍回乡。如此士气，如再驱之打内战，势必纷纷继一八四师而反战。”艾氏又说：“国军最骄傲的是有美国装备的新式武器，和经美国训练的大批军官，然在四平街之战民主联军仍能坚持三十四天之久，足见武器和训练的军官亦非压倒一切的”。
