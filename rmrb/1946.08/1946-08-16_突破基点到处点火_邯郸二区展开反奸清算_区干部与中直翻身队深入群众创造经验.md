Breaking Through Key Points, Lighting Fires Everywhere
Handan's Second District Launches Anti-Traitor Liquidation
District Cadres and Central Government Turn-Over Teams Deepen into the Masses to Create Experience

[This newspaper Handan News] The Handan County Second District cadres and the Central Government's peasant turn-over team, in a month of exploration, discovered a way to open up the situation and carry out work: that is, it is necessary to launch a universal mass anti-traitor accusation upsurge, liquidate the blood debts of the enemy and puppets over the past eight years, overwhelm the evil forces, promote national righteousness, in order to break the remaining rule of traitors, spies, bullies, and stubborn landlords who are combined in the countryside, inspire the enthusiasm of the masses, rectify mass organizations, and lay the foundation for peasants to further reduce rent and liquidate, solve the land problem, achieve land to the tiller, and completely turn over. After the team went to the countryside at the end of June, after breaking through key points, gaining experience, and understanding the situation, and after a short period of training village cadres, they implemented the policy of lighting fires everywhere. Recently, the masses throughout the district have begun to move towards a universal mass anti-traitor liquidation struggle.

After the comrades of the team went to the countryside, they and the district cadres were scattered in eight key villages. They led more than 20 struggles against traitors and bullies, with more than 30,000 people participating. They patiently carried out persuasive education for backward village cadres. Some comrades even accompanied the villagers to hoe the fields, water the fields, watch melon sheds, and rescue from floods. Finally, they realized the many complex problems left over in this area after the increased assets, rent reduction, and land redemption movements. After the liberation of Handan, anti-traitors were not carried out first, the traitor and puppet elements were not sanctioned, and they still ran rampant in the countryside, and took the opportunity to drill into mass organizations, militia organizations, and even village political power, secretly manipulating their leadership. Landlords and peasants were prematurely stimulated by the movement to increase assets and reduce rent. As a result, stubborn landlords, bullies, and traitorous elements combined to counterattack tenants by various means and sabotage the peasant turn-over movement. The interests of middle peasants and poor peasants (such as enemy and puppet extortion, debts, burdens, etc.) have not been properly resolved, so they have become wait-and-see and hesitant to participate enthusiastically in the movement, and tenants have fallen into isolation. At the same time, the leaders who emerged in the tenant movement also led the struggle to reduce rent and increase assets, but due to the leadership's inappropriately raising the status of tenants in the past, only giving them leadership powers but lacking correct ideological education, coupled with the influence and indoctrination of individual district cadres' bad work styles, many tenant cadres became arrogant, indulgent, dictatorial, corrupt, and alienated from the masses, which not only aroused dissatisfaction among middle peasants and poor peasants, but most tenant masses also developed a sense of revulsion towards them. Traitors, spies, bullies, and stubborn landlords used these contradictions to create opposition between trade unions, farmers' associations, and militias, disputes between front and back streets, clans, and factions in a village, and disunity between villages by various despicable methods such as rumor-mongering, instigation, threats, and enticements. In addition, they used both hard and soft tactics to sandwich and attack, turning some tenant cadres into prisoners of the rural reactionary camp in order to suppress the masses' turn-over struggle. In another type of village, our work had a considerable foundation during the War of Resistance. Some old village cadres made some contributions to the War of Resistance. Since the liberation of Handan, they also led the masses to struggle against increased assets, reduced rent, redeemed land, and fought against traitors and bullies. However, due to lack of leadership, lack of ideological education, undemocratic practices, self-importance, unfair distribution of fruits, and undertaking everything on behalf of the masses without fully mobilizing them, they also became alienated from the masses. There were many cries of dissatisfaction from below, "cadres have turned over, but the masses have not turned over." This type of village cadre also made the masses afraid, afraid to speak, afraid to reflect problems, becoming a great difficulty in mobilizing the masses. Although organizational cleansing and struggle against individual important traitorous elements had been carried out in the previous stage of the anti-traitor struggle, the masses were still not fully mobilized, and the above-mentioned complex problems were not resolved, and the foundation of the rural reactionary camp was not shaken.

Two Hundred and Eighty-Five Village Cadres Go to Ninety-Two Villages to Light Fires

After the district cadres and the turn-over team comrades understood the essence of the above-mentioned situation in each key village and created some experience in transforming old village cadres, cultivating new activists, and transforming mass organizations manipulated by traitors, bullies, and stubborn landlords, they decided at the July 15th meeting to train village cadres in large numbers, implement the policy of lighting fires everywhere, and universally launch the anti-traitor liquidation movement. The training classes were held in eight locations. A total of 285 trainees came from 92 administrative villages. Among these people, there were relatively pure old village cadres and new activists, as well as old village cadres with mistakes. The training class did not instill any articles to the masses, but the masses educated themselves with their own and their villages' experience. Everyone very kindly told about the suffering they had suffered throughout their lives, and accused the enemy and puppets of their crimes over the past eight years. Many kind farmers recalled the tragic past and wept.

Further, everyone traced the root of these sufferings. After careful accounting, everyone understood that they should be the masters, but their blood and sweat fed a group of parasites. Everyone also reviewed why the masses had not been completely turned over after Handan was liberated for ten months. Activists revealed the crimes of traitors, spies, bullies, and illegal landlords in oppressing the masses and bribing village cadres, and also criticized some village cadres for corruption, degeneration, and taking the landlord line. Cadres who had made mistakes in villages such as Jia Village and Jia Village made confessions. A trade union representative painfully recounted how the landlord gave him cigarettes to smoke, cooked good food for him, and used his daughter-in-law to seduce him and instigate him to assassinate good cadres. Many trade union representatives, farmer association directors, and militia captains made similar confessions and reflections. Everyone warmly welcomed their repentance and progress. Finally, in the training class, the activists and the repented village cadres unanimously and solemnly took an oath to get rid of the old work styles of corruption, degeneration, and taking the landlord line in the past, establish new work styles of integrity, putting the public before private interests, and taking the mass line, and vowed to work hard for the complete turn-over of the masses. In this training class, the old cadres received preliminary transformation, the new cadres received ideological education, reviewed the past work, and arranged for future struggles. Everyone gained sufficient confidence and courage for their own turn-over. At the same time, the district cadres and the turn-over team comrades roughly recognized the true face of each village in the district through this training class and discovered many new activists. These have become the foundation for lighting fires everywhere and opening up the situation in the entire district. This is exactly the case. Not many days after the end of the training class, the trainees lit fires in their own villages, and the comrades of the turn-over team also dispersed from the eight key villages to more than 30 small key points to "refuel and turn on the lights" everywhere. The fire of the peasant masses' turn-over burned most of the villages in the district.

Where is this flame burning? What are the masses doing after they are mobilized? The answer is very clear: organize a universal mass anti-traitor accusation upsurge.

Organize the Masses to Accuse Traitors and the Fire of Turn-Over Burns

The 14 villages with Qichadao Village as the core are at the forefront of the entire district. Not only was their training class the most practical and best, but they also created some experience for the entire district in the anti-traitor accusation struggle. This anti-traitor struggle is a broad united front movement of all classes of people in the countryside. The purpose is to liquidate the big traitors who have committed heinous crimes, and at the same time wash the faces of the traitor and puppet personnel, let them reflect and confess, reform themselves, and be good people again. In Qichadao Village and its surrounding villages, the masses have been organized into many "accusation groups" under the leadership of trained activists, and the traitor and puppet personnel have been organized into many "confession groups." The two groups are working tensely at the same time. The time for the meeting is during the cool-off time and after dinner, because these masses are free when they come back from hoeing the fields. In the "accusation group," the masses complained about the crimes of the traitors over the past eight years: killing, beating, scolding, pulling out old cotton from the masses' cotton clothes and quilts, searching for the little remaining grain of the masses, and offering it to the Japanese invaders. The masses scolded traitors and puppet troops for selling the country and selling their ancestors. They automatically proposed to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's serving as a "puppet army" for the United States, because the Chiang army used American guns and cannons, was trained by the United States, and fought a civil war in order to sell China to the United States. Its shameful role was similar to that of the Japanese puppet army. The traitor and puppet personnel in the "confession group" have all found guarantors, and each person has a notebook. Any criminal facts that come to mind are recorded in the notebook by themselves or by others for confession at the meeting. They have all reported some of their crimes more or less, and realized that "without them, four Japanese people could not rule the Second District." They said: "They sold the East Second District, and Chiang Kai-shek sold the entire China." They hoped that Chiang Kai-shek would also confess to the people of the whole country. A few traitorous elements who have committed serious crimes are still unwilling to bow their heads to the masses. Now the accusing masses and the personnel who have confessed and reformed themselves are jointly preparing to carry out a serious struggle against them. In the mass anti-traitor accusation struggle that combines the two trends of accusation and confession, it is full of combat voices against Chiang Kai-shek's serving as a "puppet army" for the United States, against the civil war, defending the hometown, and defending the People's Liberation Army.

　　突破基点到处点火
    邯郸二区展开反奸清算         
    区干部与中直翻身队深入群众创造经验
    【本报邯郸讯】邯郸县第二区区干部与中直农民翻身队，在一个月来的摸索中，发现了一条打开局面、开展工作的道路：就是必须掀起一个普遍的群众性的反奸控诉高潮，清算敌伪八年来的血债，压倒邪气，伸张民族正气，才能打破汉奸、特务、恶霸、顽固地主互相结合的在农村的残余统治，启发群众的热情，整顿群众的组织，为农民进一步减租清算、解决土地问题、达到耕者有其田、彻底翻身打下基础。该队六月底下乡后，经过突破基点，取得经验，了解情况，又经过短期训练村干，实行到处点火，最近全区群众正开始走向普遍的群众性的反奸清算斗争。
    该队同志们下乡之后与区干部分散在八个基点村，他们领导过二十几次反对汉奸恶霸的斗争，有三万多群众参加。他们耐心地进行过对于落后村干的说服教育，有的同志还陪老乡们在田里锄地、浇水、看瓜棚，抢救水灾，终于认识了这个地区经过增资、减租、赎地运动后所遗留下来的许多复杂问题。邯郸解放之后，首先没有进行反奸，奸伪分子没有受到制裁，依然在农村中横行霸道，并乘机钻进群众团体，民兵组织甚至村政权中，部分窃取其领导，暗中操纵。地主和农民过早受到了增资减租的刺激，结果，顽固地主、恶霸和奸伪分子相结合，用种种办法向雇佃反攻，并破坏农民翻身运动。中农和贫农的利益（如敌伪讹诈、债务、负担等等）没有得到适当解决，因此他们走向观望徘徊没有热烈参加运动，雇佃陷于孤立。同时，在雇佃运动中涌现出来的领袖，他们也领导过减租增资斗争，但由于过去领导上不适当地抬高雇佃的地位，只给以领导的职权而缺乏正确的思想教育，再加上个别区干不良作风的影响和熏染，以致不少雇佃干部骄傲、放纵、独断专行、贪污、受贿、脱离群众，不仅引起中农、贫农的不满，而多数雇佃群众也对他们发生反感。汉奸、特务、恶霸和顽固地主就利用这些矛盾，用种种鄙卑方法如造谣、挑拨、威胁、利诱等等，造成工会、农会、民兵之间的对立，一村中前街、后街、宗族、派别的纠纷以及村与村之间的不团结。此外，他们更软硬兼施，两面夹击，把一部分雇佃干部变成农村反动阵营的俘虏，以压制群众的翻身斗争。在另一类型的村庄中，我们的工作在抗战中曾有相当基础，有些老村干对抗战有些贡献，邯郸解放以来，也曾领导群众增资、减租、赎地、反奸反恶霸的斗争，但由于缺乏领导，缺乏思想教育，不民主，自高自满，分果实不公，包办代替，没充分发动群众，因此也形成他们脱离群众，下面很多“干部翻了身，群众没翻身”的不满呼声。这一类的村干，也使群众害怕，不敢说话，不敢反映问题，成为发动群众的很大困难。虽然在前一阶段反奸斗争中实行过清洗组织并斗争过个别重要奸伪分子，但依然没有充分发动群众，以上这些复杂问题并未得到解决，更没有动摇农村反动阵营的基础。
            二百八十五个村干部到九十二个村去点火
    区干部与翻身队的同志们在各基点村了解了上述情况的实质并创造了若干改造老村干，培养新积极分子，改造奸伪、恶霸、顽固地主所操纵的群众团体的经验之后，就在七月十五日的会议上决定大量训练村干，实行到处点火，普遍开展反奸清算运动的方针。训练班分八处举行。九十二个行政村共来了二百八十五个受训者。这些人中，有比较纯洁的老村干与新积极分子，也有带着错误的老村干。训练班不是给群众灌输什么条文，而是群众用自身和本村的经验教育自己。大家很亲切地诉说了一辈子所遭受的苦难，控诉了敌伪八年来的罪恶。有许多良善的农民回忆起惨痛的过去，泣不成声。
    进一步大家又追寻了这些苦难的根源。经过细密的算账，大家懂得了自己应当是主人，而自己的血汗却喂养了一批寄生虫。大家又检讨了邯郸解放已十个月，为什么群众没能彻底翻身。积极分子们揭发了汉奸、特务、恶霸、不法地主欺压群众与贿买村干的罪恶，同时也批评了一部分村干贪污、腐化、走地主路线等错误。贾庄、夹地等村犯过错误的干部，做了坦白。一个工会代表沉痛地诉说了地主如何给他烟吸，给他做好饭吃，并用自己的儿媳勾引他，唆使他暗杀好干部等丑恶行为，有不少工会代表，农会主任，民兵队长作了类似的坦白反省。大家热忱地欢迎他们的改悔和进步。最后，在训练班里，积极分子们与改悔了的村干们又一致庄严地举行宣誓，革除过去贪污、腐化、走地主路线的旧作风，建立廉洁、先公后私、走群众路线的新作风，誓愿为群众的彻底翻身而努力。在这个训练班里，旧干部得到了初步改造，新干部得到了思想教育，检讨了过去的工作，布置了以后的斗争，大家对于自己的翻身，获得了足够的信心和勇气。同时区干部和翻身队的同志们经过了这个训练班，大致认识了全区各村的真面貌，发现了许多新的积极分子。这些都成为到处点火，全区打开局面的基础。事实也正是这样。训练班结束不几天，受训者都在自己的村里点起火来，翻身队的同志们也从八个基点村分散到三十多个小基点，到处去“加油拨灯”。农民群众的翻身之火把全区大部分村庄燃烧起来了。
    这个火焰往那里烧呢？群众发动起来干什么呢？答案是很明确的：组织普遍的群众性的反奸控诉高潮。
            组织群众反奸控诉  翻身烈火燃烧起来
    以七岔道村为核心的十四个村庄走在全区的最前面。不仅他们的训练班办的最实际最好，就是在反奸控诉斗争中他们也给全区创造了一些经验。这个反奸斗争是农村各阶层人民联合的广泛统一战线的运动，其目的是清算罪大恶极的大汉奸，同时给奸伪人员洗脸，让他们反省坦白，改过自新，重做好人。在七岔道村及其周围各村，群众已在受过训的积极分子们领导之下，编成许多“控诉小组”，而奸伪人员们则被编成许多“坦白小组”。两种小组同时紧张工作着。开会的时间是歇凉时和晚饭后，因为这些群众们锄地回来的空闲时候。在“控诉小组”里，群众申诉汉奸们八年来的罪恶：杀人、打人、骂人、扯出群众棉衣棉被中的旧棉花，搜出群众仅余的一点粮食，供俸日寇等等。群众斥骂汉奸、皇协军，卖国家、卖祖宗。他们自动提出反对蒋介石给美国当“皇协军”，因为蒋军用美国枪炮，受美国训练，为了把中国卖给美国而打内战，其可耻的作用，是和当日寇皇协军差不多的。“坦白小组”里的奸伪人员们，都找了保人，每人还有一个笔记本，随时想到的罪恶事实，就由自己或请人在笔记本上记下来以备在会上坦白。他们都或多或少报告了自己一些罪恶，并且认识了“如果没有他们，四个日本人是不能统治二区的。”他们说：“他们卖的是东二区，蒋介石卖的是全中国。”他们希望蒋介石也向全国人民坦白。少数罪恶重大的奸伪分子，还不愿向群众低头，现在控诉的群众们和已经坦白自新的人员们正联合准备对他们进行严重的斗争。在控诉与坦白两股潮流相结合的群众性反奸控诉斗争里，充满着反对蒋介石给美国当“皇协军”，反对内战，保卫家乡，保卫解放军的战斗声音。
