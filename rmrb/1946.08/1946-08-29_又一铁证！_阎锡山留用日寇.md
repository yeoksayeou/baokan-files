　　Another Ironclad Proof!
    Yan Xishan Retains Japanese Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 24th] The nine captured Japanese officers and soldiers of the enemy who were captured by the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army in the counter-attack self-defense battles in Guoxian and Yuanping in northern Shanxi have arrived here. The ironclad fact has completely shattered Yan Xishan's lie that "there are no Japanese troops in Shanxi." These nine people originally belonged to the enemy's Independent Third Mixed Brigade. Now they have been renamed and promoted by Yan Xishan and retained in a certain unit. For example, Kinji Saburo, the former lieutenant deputy of the artillery squadron of the enemy's Independent Third Mixed Brigade, has now changed his name to Yin Weiman and nominally serves as the deputy director of the military supply department of the 2nd Security Brigade of Yan's army, but is actually the major commander of the team. In addition, Kiyonaga Tazawa, Nobuyuki Kawada, Saburo Matsumoto, and Mibō Matsumoto all serve as instructors in the team. According to Kiyonaga Tazawa, "The training content includes rifle, machine gun, and grenade launcher shooting, bayonet fighting techniques, fortifications, as well as tactics for attacking the Eighth Route Army and other subjects." According to Nagai Mahide, an enemy soldier who was incorporated into the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the 40th Division of Yan's army as a heavy machine gun shooter, they were never disarmed until they were disarmed by the Eighth Route Army this time. In order to expand the civil war, Yan Xishan adopted various means to retain Japanese troops, in addition to promotion and reuse, and marrying Chinese wives for Japanese soldiers. Motada Yukio married Jie Cuihua, a 17-year-old from Dai County this year. Sato Yushio, a Japanese soldier who was a sergeant in the communications company of the 2nd Regiment of the 40th Division of Yan's army, married Jin Lian from Sairi Village in Dai County. Nagai Mahide also confessed: "Until I was captured on July 11, I did not know that Japan had surrendered, I only knew that there was a temporary truce." This is because Yan Xishan has been deceiving and concealing them for a long time.

　　又一铁证！
    阎锡山留用日寇
    【新华社兴县二十四日电】晋绥八路军在晋北崞县、原平等地反击自卫战中俘护之九名日军官兵已抵达此间，铁的事实已完全粉碎了阎锡山“山西已无日军”的谎话。彼等九人原属敌独立第三混成旅团，今被阎锡山易名晋级留用于某部队中，如原任敌独立第三混成旅团炮兵中队少尉队副近自三郎，今已改名为尹维满，名义上任阎军保安第二大队军需处副处长，实为该队之少校指挥官。又加龙泽静男、川田延以、松本三郎、松本昧芳等均任该队教官。据龙泽静男称：“教练内容除步枪、机枪、掷弹筒射击等、白刃战动作，筑城学外，并有袭击八路军战术等科目”。又据被编入阎军十九军四十师二团三营充任重机枪射手之敌军永井真秀称：他们始终未被缴收过武器，直至此次始被八路军解除武装。阎锡山为了扩大内战竟采用种种手段留用日军，除晋级重用外，并为日本士兵娶中国妻子。茂田之雄今年娶了代县城内十七岁的解翠花为妻，在阎军十九军四十师二团通讯连担任上士之日军佐藤之男曾娶代县塞里村之金莲为妻，永井真秀又供称：“直至七月十一日被俘前，尚不知日本投降，只知为暂时休战”。这是因为阎锡山长期欺骗蒙蔽着他们。
