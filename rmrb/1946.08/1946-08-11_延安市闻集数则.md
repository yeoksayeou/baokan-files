　　Yan'an City News Items

　　Rosinger Visits Liu Shanben
　　American reporter K. Rosinger, after arriving in Yan'an on the 21st of last month, stayed at the Foreign Affairs Group. On the 25th, he visited Liu Shanben, Zhang Shouyi, and other air force friends at the Reception Office. When Rosinger asked Captain Liu what he planned to do after coming to Yan'an, Liu said, "I want to publicize opposition to the civil war among Kuomintang air force personnel, because the civil war hinders China's independence and peace." When talking about the comparison between Yan'an and the Kuomintang areas, Captain Liu said, "In Hunan alone, millions of victims have starved to death, but there is not a single beggar in Yan'an. Democrats are subject to terrorist assassinations by fascist secret agents in the Kuomintang areas, but they are protected in Yan'an - the refuge of Mr. Li Furen of the Democratic League in the border area is an example. Kuomintang personnel are also well received - yesterday I personally saw a team of Kuomintang troops safely passing through Yan'an to Guilin."

　　Labor Hero Sends New Wheat to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
　　Yang Buhao, a labor hero from Yan'an County, drove three donkeys to send one *shi* of wheat each to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu as payment for cultivation. Chairman Mao warmly shook Old Yang's hand and said, "Thank you!" Afterwards, they sat down together to talk about crops. Old Yang said, "This year's wheat is a bumper harvest, yielding more than one *shi* per *hectare*, a total of more than forty *shi*. The autumn seedlings are also growing very well, and the people are very happy." Chairman Mao smiled with satisfaction as he listened to him. When Old Yang was about to leave, Chairman Mao gave him some noodles, rice, biscuits, and sugar... Old Yang delivered the wheat to Wangjiaping, smiling and saying to the Commander-in-Chief, "I've been wanting to see you for a long time!" When the Commander-in-Chief heard that Old Yang's wife was ill, he repeatedly advised him, "If your wife's illness cannot be cured, you can send her here. There are good doctors and good medicine here." The Commander-in-Chief also gave him more than a hundred red and large tomatoes that he had grown himself, instructing Old Yang to cultivate the crops even better.

　　延安市闻集数则
    罗辛格访刘善本
    美记者Ｋ·罗辛格，于上月二十一日抵延后，下榻外事组，二十五日赴交际处访刘善本、张受益等空军朋友。当罗辛格问到刘上尉来延后打算做些什么时，刘说：“我要向国民党空军人员宣传反对内战，因为内战防碍中国的独立与和平”。在谈到延安与国民党区域的比较时，刘上尉说：“仅仅湖南一地就有数百万灾民饿死，但延安没有一个乞丐。民主人士在国民党区受到法西斯特务的恐怖暗杀，在延安则受到保护——民盟李敷仁先生来边区避难就是一个例子。对于国民党人士也是很好的招待——昨天我亲眼看到一队国民党军队安全地经过延安到桂林去。”
