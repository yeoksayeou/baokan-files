　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th: Shanghai report: "Soviet New Life," a Russian-language newspaper run by Soviet citizens in this city, published an editorial on July 25th entitled "Not What, But How," commenting on the U.S. State Department's reaction to Madame Sun Yat-sen's recent statement on the current situation. The editorial stated: The U.S. State Department used the formula of U.S. policy toward China to oppose Madame Sun's opinion, saying, "Our policy toward China, as we have always said, is to seek China's unity." However, the issue is not about flaunting abstract principles and good intentions, but about seeking the best paths and methods to realize good principles and good intentions. Naturally, no one has ever hoped or does hope that the U.S. State Department would issue a statement saying that the U.S. wants to divide China, to make the conflicting parties more contentious, and to incite a greater civil war. First, in any case, the American people do not and will not have such intentions; second, even if some ruling figures in the U.S. have such a desire, they would never openly and shamelessly express this meaning in our era of striving for democracy and opposing fascism. However, the State Department's repetition of this bare, abstract formula in response to Madame Sun's statement, which earnestly requests the concrete realization of America's good intentions, is even more perplexing. The editorial continued: The natural response of the United States to Madame Sun's statement should be to re-examine the actual U.S. policy toward China. This policy has been in place for almost a year, and it has neither established a democratic government in China, nor been able to reconcile the hostile parties, nor has it weakened the danger of a long-term, bloody civil war. Chinese newspapers often point out in alarm the decline of American prestige in China. This decline in prestige is due to Marshall's failure to complete and resolve his mission, because the U.S. military is not withdrawing from China, and the U.S. only provides unilateral assistance. U.S. State Department officials should really pay more attention to the opinions expressed by Madame Sun, because, as the United Press said, they at least reflect the opinions of ninety-nine percent of the Chinese people. It is not possible to unilaterally announce good-sounding intentions without changing concrete political actions, actions that have caused the Chinese people to suffer for many months and have lowered American prestige.

　　沪苏联新生活报著文
    批评美固执助蒋政策
    美国务院应更多的注意孙夫人声明
    【新华社南京七日电】沪讯：本市苏联公民主办之俄文新生活报，于七月二十五日发表社论，题为“不是什么而是怎样”，评美国国务院对宋庆龄女士最近所发表对当前时局意见的反映。该社论称：美国务院用美国对华政策的公式来反对孙夫人的意见说，“我们对华政策正如我们一向所说的那样，是求中国的团结”，但是问题不在于标榜抽象的原则，善良的打算，而在寻求最好的道路和方法实现良好的原则和善良的打算。自然，谁也没有盼望过也并不盼望着美国务院发出这样声明说美国是要分裂中国，是要使争执的双方更加争执，并煽起更大的内战。第一、无论如何，美国的人民没有并且也不会有这样的意图；第二、即使美国某些统治人物有这样的意愿，他也无论如何不会在我们争民主和反法西斯的时代公开的不知羞愧的把这意思说出来。但是，国务院重述这赤裸裸抽象的公式来答复孙夫人坚请具体实现美国善良打算的声明，那就更加的百思不解了。该社论继称：美国对孙夫人声明的自然反映，应该重新审查美国对华的实际政策，这政策已快一年了，既没有在华建立民主政府，也没有能够使敌对的双方和解，更没有削弱长期流血内战的危险。中国报纸时常惊慌地指出美国在华威信的降低，此威信的降低，是由于马歇尔未能完成和解决的使命失败的原因，是因为美国武装不运出中国，美国只对单方协助。美国的国务院人士实在应多多注意孙夫人所表示的意见，因为他正如联合社所说，至少反映出中国人民百分之九十九的意见。不能单方面宣布善良的好听的打算，同时又不改变具体的政治行动，由于那种行动，中国人民已身受了好多个月的痛苦，降低了美国的威信。
