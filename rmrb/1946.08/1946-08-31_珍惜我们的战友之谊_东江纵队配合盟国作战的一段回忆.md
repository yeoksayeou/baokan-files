　　Cherish Our Comradeship-in-Arms
　　——A Recollection of the Dongjiang Column Coordinating with Allied Forces in Combat
Editor's Note: This article is written by a member of the Dongjiang Column, recalling how they risked their lives to rescue American pilots and assisted American intelligence work while persisting in the anti-Japanese war in Guangdong. At a time when American imperialist elements are helping Chiang Kai-shek expand the civil war, he loudly appeals to people from all walks of life in America: "Cherish our comradeship-in-arms." The original text is as follows:
　　On February 10th of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), when Lieutenant Kerr of the U.S. 14th Air Force attacked Hong Kong Airport, his plane was set on fire by enemy bullets. Kerr bailed out and escaped, but was closely pursued by Japanese soldiers. However, he was rescued by a young orderly of the Dongjiang Column and, under the strict protection of the local people, survived three weeks of enemy searches before being transferred to the rear. On May 26th, near Daya Bay, they rescued Lieutenant Lovejoy and five other pilots. On January 16th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), they also rescued Lieutenant Iger of the 14th Air Force and Ensign Kerr Han of the U.S. Third Fleet, all of whom were safely returned to the rear. In October of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), the U.S. Military Headquarters in China dispatched Mr. Qu Daiyi, a technical representative of the U.S. Land Technical Resources Committee, with a radio and a radio operator to establish an intelligence group at the Dongjiang Column Headquarters. This group did not leave until September of last year. To assist the U.S. intelligence group, the Dongjiang Column established a special intelligence work department, staffed by more than 200 people. The intelligence station stretched from Hong Kong in the south to Guangzhou in the north, from Hailufeng in the east to the east bank of the Pearl River in the west. After the fall of northern Guangdong and the West River area, it expanded to the West River and North River areas, and the Dongjiang Column specially dispatched carefully selected cadres to develop the work. All expenses were raised independently, and many outstanding cadres sacrificed heroically for this common cause of the Allies. In March of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), U.S. Navy Major Ganshaw led a working group to the Dongjiang liberated area to conduct coastal surveys in preparation for the Allied forces to land there. The Dongjiang Column immediately sent cadres to assist in the on-the-spot investigation and collect relevant materials. Due to the efficient efforts of the Dongjiang Column staff and the direct supply of much valuable intelligence to the U.S. military and the 14th Air Force, the U.S. Military Headquarters in Washington and the 14th Air Force repeatedly praised the Dongjiang Column intelligence station as "the most important intelligence station for the U.S. military in central Southeast China." They praised the intelligence it obtained as being "consistently superior in quality and quantity," making "a decisive contribution to the success of the U.S. Strategic Service in China," and helping the U.S. military command organs "reach better conclusions and plans." In no time, American warmongers have abandoned the friendship between the Chinese and American people, and driven the armed forces composed of the American people to flagrantly help Chiang Kai-shek slaughter the Chinese people in the North China Liberated Areas and undermine the friendship between the Chinese and American people. The American people should unite to urge the U.S. government to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China and stop all aid to Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government in the civil war.

### 珍惜我们的战友之谊——东江纵队配合盟国作战的一段回忆

　　珍惜我们的战友之谊
    ——东江纵队配合盟国作战的一段回忆
    编者按：此文是东江纵队一队员所作，回忆过去坚持广东抗战时，如何奋不顾身营救美飞行员，并协助美军情报工作等事迹。当此美帝国主义分子正助蒋扩大内战之际，他特向美国朝野人士大声疾呼：“珍惜我们的战友之谊”。原文如下：
    当三十三年二月十日时，美十四航空队克尔中尉，驾机袭击香港机场时，飞机中敌弹焚毁，克尔跳伞逃生，紧遭日寇索捕，但为东江纵队一小勤务员救护，并在当地人民严密保护下渡过敌人三周搜查，旋被辗转护送至大后方。五月二十六日，复在大亚湾救护勒夫哥中尉以下五名飞行员。三十四年一月十六日，又救出十四航空队伊格中尉及美第三舰队飞行员克尔汉少尉，均经安全送回大后方。在华美军总部，特于三十三年十月，派遣美陆上技术资源委员会技术代表区戴义西，携电台及报务员至东江纵队司令部设立情报组，该组直至去年九月始行离开。东江纵队为协助美情报组工作，曾建立一特别情报工作部门，配备工作人员两百余名。情报站南起香港，北迄广州，东自海陆×，西至珠江东岸。粤北与西江沦陷后，复扩展至西江与北江，东江纵队特加派精选的干部开辟工作，一切经费均自筹，不少优秀干部曾为此盟国共同事业而英勇牺牲。三十四年三月，美海军甘萧少校率一工作组至东江解放区进行沿海测量工作，以准备盟军在该处登陆作战，东江纵队立派干部协助实地调查，搜集有关材料。由于东江纵队工作人员的精干努力，与直接供给美军及十四航空队以许多宝贵的情报，华盛顿在华美军总部及十四航空队曾倍加赞扬，誉东江纵队情报站为“美军在东南中部最重要的情报站。”评奖其所获情报“质与量都经常优越”，“对美国战略部在中国工作的成功有着决定的贡献”，帮助了美军指挥机关“取得更好的结论和计划”。曾几何时，美国野心家已抛弃中美人民友谊，而驱使美国人民组成之武装，悍然帮助蒋介石在华北解放区屠杀中国人民，及其武装破坏中美人民友谊。美国人民亟应团结起来，督促美国政府撤退驻华美军，停止对蒋介石内战独裁政府的一切援助。（新华社烟台二十六日电）
