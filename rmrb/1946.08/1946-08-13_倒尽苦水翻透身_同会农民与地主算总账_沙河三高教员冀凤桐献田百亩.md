　　Pouring Out Grievances and Turning Themselves Inside Out
	Peasants and Landlords Gather to Settle Accounts
	Ji Fengtong, Teacher at Shahe No. 3 High School, Donates 100 Mu of Land

　　[Report from this newspaper in Wu'an] Tonghui Village was an advanced village during the rent reduction campaign last winter and this spring. In late June, the county committee, in order to deepen the movement, again used Tonghui as a model village for investigation. It was found that although Tonghui Village had experienced a vigorous struggle in the past, the feudal economy still accounted for a large proportion. For example, the land rented out still accounted for 41% (before the rent reduction last winter it accounted for 60%), and the 79 landlords had an average of about seven mu of land each. There were 156 tenant households in the village, renting 2,447 mu of land, accounting for 46% of the cultivated land of the tenant households. There were still 39 extremely poor peasants who had not obtained land, and the average amount of land obtained by peasants was less than 1.7 mu per person. Many backward peasants did not participate in the movement, and their emancipation was not thorough. The arrogance of the evil landlords was still rampant. In June, the heinous landlord Yang Binggong brutally strangled Yang Shunyi's wife, who was actively settling accounts and struggling against him, and threw her body into a well. This massacre further angered and alerted the villagers, who shouted, "Since the emancipation movement last winter, although we have removed 'Living Yama' Yang Xichang and 'Pale Face' Song Yuming from Tonghui Street, there are still many evil bullies, local despots, and landlords who have not been thoroughly struggled against. Today, they have colluded again to harm our emancipated masses. We must unite tightly and resolutely avenge the death of Shunyi's family! We are not afraid of being slapped by fans, and we are not afraid of being drowned when crossing the river! The struggle must be thorough, and the emancipation must be complete!" They were brewing within the streets, and activists launched a persuasion movement to mobilize the vast majority of backward peasants. The struggle to thoroughly pour out grievances and settle accounts was universally ignited in Tonghui Village.

　　On July 26, a general meeting was held, and all the peasants poured out their grievances and settled accounts with the 13 large households. Yang Shaoxian, the "King of the Southwest" who had been powerful for a lifetime, stood before the masses with his head down, trembling all over as he confessed the details of Yang Binggong, Si Lou, and Qi Lou's families murdering Shunyi's wife. Yang Si Lou and others initially quibbled, but because the evidence was conclusive, they had to admit that they had committed the murder and should bear the responsibility for wearing mourning clothes and handling all the funeral affairs for the deceased. The audience shouted angrily and押(yā)把(bǎ)杀(shā)人(rén)犯(fàn)押(yā)下(xià)去(qù) the murderers were taken away, and the settlement of accounts continued. Liu Longshan, an old man in his sixties, jumped up and said, "My mind couldn't be opened with a stone before, but now it's like a lock with a key, and it opens with a click!" The old man's face turned red and green with anger, and he pointed at Qi Lou's face and said, "In the old society, poor people had no reason, but now the world has changed. Tell everyone, why did you treat us so harshly!" Old man Yang Heshang squeezed onto the table, saying that he had suffered for most of his life and saw everything clearly. Only when the Eighth Route Army came did the poor have a chance to speak up and have reason.

　　One person followed another, and even the most honest people were eager to speak. One by one, accounts of exploitation and sweat were brought up: Tenant Lao Wangdian was falsely accused by landlord Yang Si Lou of stealing his pumpkins, fined 20 yuan, and his house was searched. Yang Si Lou said, "It would have been cheaper for you if I had sent you to the blockhouse to be picked by the Japanese."

　　Li Mancang, Qiao Erlou, and others caressed the scars burned by the Japanese after being sent there by landlord Song Qinggeng, and cried out their grievances. Widow Liu Quanhe's family said that she had complained that her husband had planted the land for ten years (i.e., half-cropping) and had been exploited for ten years. As soon as her husband died, landlord Hu Xiufeng took back the land! He also confiscated the livestock and carts, and drove her and her four children out of the house. As she spoke, tears streamed down her face. Xing Wenlin, the director of the peasant association, tearfully recounted his past suffering: In famine years, when there was nothing to eat, he went to the fields to find some wild vegetables to eat, but the landlord Song Quanxin said that he had pulled the millet from his field. When he picked some elm leaves from other people's trees, Song Quanxin insisted that he should be punished and said, "You poor bastards, you live under the sky of Tonghui and stand on the land of Tonghui, how dare you do evil?" He was driven out of the village. When Xing Wenlin said this, he and his wife couldn't help but cry bitterly. The peasants all recalled their past tragic experiences, and a sob echoed through the meeting place. The peasants asked about each item of grievance, "Is this true?" The landlords lowered their heads and said, "This is true, please forgive us, raise your hands and let us get by." The peasants poured out their grievances, letting the sun scorch them mercilessly, without taking a break. Everyone excitedly shouted, "Let's strike while the iron is hot!" The meeting continued vigorously until noon the next day, and the peasants resolved to thoroughly pour out their grievances and completely emancipate themselves through this struggle.

　　[Report from this newspaper in Shahe] Ji Fengtong (female), a teacher at Shahe No. 3 High School, was deeply moved after seeing news reports about land donations from various places. In order to promote the rapid realization of "land to the tiller," she specially donated more than 100 mu of her own land to the poor peasants of her village for cultivation, which was deeply welcomed by the villagers.

　　倒尽苦水翻透身            
    同会农民与地主算总账            
    沙河三高教员冀凤桐献田百亩
　　【本报武安讯】同会村在去冬今春减租时，是先进的村庄，六月下旬，县委为深入运动，又以同会为典型村之一，进行了调查，发现原来过去曾进行过轰轰烈烈斗争的同会村，封建经济仍占很大比重，如租出地仍占百分之四十一（去冬减租前占百分之六十），七十九户地主，每人平均地约七亩以上。全村有佃户一百五十六户，租入土地二千四百四十七亩，占佃户耕地面积百分之四十六，未获得土地的赤贫农尚有三十九户，农民得到土地的平均数每人不到一亩七分地。许多落后农民没参加运动，翻身极不彻底，恶霸地主凶焰仍炽。六月，万恶的地主杨炳功竟下毒手把积极和他算账斗争的杨顺义媳妇用绳勒死投尸井内，这个惨杀更激怒和警惕了全村农民，纷纷喊着说：“去冬闹翻身到现在，咱同会街虽说去掉了“活阎王”杨锡昌，“大白脸”宋玉明，但还有许多恶霸、土劣、地主还没有斗透，他们今天竟又勾起手来害咱翻身群众，咱们一定要团结紧，坚决为算账死了的顺义家报仇！打破头皮不怕扇子扇，过河不怕大水淹！斗争要斗透，翻身要翻彻底！”他们分街酝酿着，积极分子开展了劝说运动，把广大落后农民都发动了起来。彻底诉苦算账的斗争即在同会村普遍燃烧起来。
    七月二十六号开大会，全体农民向十三大户诉苦算总账。威风一世的“西南王”杨绍先，低垂着头站在群众面前，全身战抖地供出杨炳功、四楼、七楼家害死顺义媳妇的经过。杨四楼等先是狡辩，后因证据确凿，不得不承认人是他害死的，并应承担为死者披麻带孝办理一切后事。全场愤怒的呼叫着，把杀人犯押下去，又继续算账。六十多岁老汉刘龙山跳起来说：“我早先脑筋拿石头砸也砸不开，现在就好象锁子有了钥匙，咯巴一下就开了！”老汉气得脸上红一阵青一阵，指着七楼家的脸说：“早先社会穷人有理也没理，现在世道变啦，你给大家说说，你为啥要刻薄咱！”老汉杨和尚挤着跳上桌子，他说他受了多半辈子苦，啥事都看得清清格格的，只有八路军过来穷人才有天，才能讲理。
    下面一个紧接着一个，最老实的人都争着发言了，一笔一笔剥削血汗账都提出来了：佃户老王殿被地主杨四楼诬赖偷了他南瓜，罚了二十元又到家翻搜，并说：“没把你送到炮楼叫日本挑了，算是便宜了你。”
    李满仓乔二楼等抚着被地主宋庆耕送到日本那里，被火烙的伤痕哭诉。寡妇刘全河家说她诉男人大种地（即半种地）十来年被剥削了十来年，男人刚死，地主胡秀峰便把地下了！把牲口、车子也没收了，又把她母子四口赶出门，说着不禁眼泪滚滚。农会主任邢文林一字一泪地诉说着过去的痛苦：荒年没啥吃，到地里找点野菜吃，地主宋全新说是拔了他地里的谷子，到别人树上摘些榆叶吃，他又非叫按上去不行，还说：“你们这些穷蛋，头顶咱同会的天，脚立咱同会的地，胆敢为非作乱？”这样就被赶出村去。邢文林说到这里两口子不由得痛哭起来，农民们都想起过去悲惨的遭遇，会场里响起一片啜泣的声音。农民们诉说一件问一件，“有没有这回事”？地主们低着头说：“有这回事，请大家原谅，抬抬手我们就过得去”。农民们倾吐着满腔的苦水，任太阳恶毒的晒着，一歇也不歇，大家兴奋的嚷着“咱们趁热干吧”！大会一股劲开到第二天晌午，农民们决心要经过这次斗争，把苦诉彻底把身翻透。
