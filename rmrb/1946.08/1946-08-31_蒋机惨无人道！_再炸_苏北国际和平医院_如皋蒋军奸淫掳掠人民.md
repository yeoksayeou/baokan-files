Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, August 28th: Following the attack on the "Northern Jiangsu International Peace Hospital" (located at the Lakeside Temple, seven miles northwest of Huai'an City) by four American-made Jiang Kai-shek planes on the afternoon of the 25th, two more American-made Jiang Kai-shek planes attacked the hospital again at 3:00 p.m. the next day (the 26th), making low-altitude continuous strafing runs for as long as 30 minutes. Thirty-three patients in the wards were hit by bullets, and two critically ill patients were further endangered due to excessive shock. Peng Baozhu, a farmer from Yulan Village, was wounded. When the Jiang planes were strafing at low altitude, American doctors at the hospital, Dr. Shelley, Dr. Gammany, and Dr. Muriel, witnessed bullets flying everywhere in the hospital and patients fleeing in terror. They were filled with indignation. It is said that since the establishment of the hospital, the location of the hospital and the process of its establishment have been telegraphed to the UNRRA offices in Peiping and Zhenjiang, and have been reported many times by the New China News Agency. The hospital is a purely medical relief organization founded by the China Welfare Fund Committee, hosted by Madame Soong Ching Ling, and assisted by UNRRA. It is already known to both Chinese and foreigners. Jiang Kai-shek's planes repeatedly use it as a target for attack, which is truly inhuman. Acting Deputy Director Ji Zhonghuan has now jointly requested the UNRRA office in Zhenjiang to lodge a serious protest with the Jiang Kai-shek side.

Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Front, August 27th: After Jiang Kai-shek's troops invaded Rugao on July 23rd, they immediately guarded the four gates and stipulated that the common people were only allowed to enter and not allowed to leave. They also ordered merchants to open their businesses within three days, and those who violated the order would have their doors sealed and houses demolished. However, the merchants who were forced to open their doors, such as the Xia Yongxing shoe store in front of the former county government, had all 300 pairs of shoes looted as soon as they opened, in the name of "comforting the refugees." Zhu He, who had served as the puppet town mayor, Zhang Conghou, the former puppet intelligence director, Huang Zhenghua, the puppet chamber of commerce director, and Qian Guoxun, who had served as a puppet soldier, were all appointed as township chiefs. After gaining power, they falsely accused Zhang Jingyu and five other residents of Liuyu Town in the west gate of fabricated crimes and "beheaded them as a warning to others." More than 30 innocent people have been imprisoned in the black jail of Dinggan Temple. The people are arbitrarily arrested to build fortifications. Along the street of Laoba in the east gate, which is 30 li long, more than 20 large and small bunkers have been built. After the conscripted laborers complete the fortifications, they are ordered to supplement the troop strength. Dozens of villages in the suburbs, such as Matou Village, Wawutou, and Wangjia Alley, have been looted. All the crops are regarded as obstacles and are forcibly ordered to be cut down. On the evening of the 25th, Jiang Kai-shek's troops were catching chickens in a house in Wawutou. A child guarding the house held on and refused to let go, saying, "The New Fourth Army has been here for so long and has never plucked a single chicken feather, but as soon as you come, you catch chickens." The Jiang Kai-shek soldiers became enraged and drew out their bayonets, stabbing the child in the chest more than a dozen times before forcibly taking the chicken away. Zhan's wife was tied up and raped, and hanged herself that night.

　　蒋机惨无人道！
    再炸“苏北国际和平医院”
    如皋蒋军奸淫掳掠人民
    【新华社淮阴二十八日电】继廿五日下午美制蒋机四架袭击“苏北国际和平医院”院址（设淮安城西北七里之湖心寺）之后，次日（二十六）下午三时，又有美制蒋机两架，再度袭击该院，低飞连续扫射达三十分钟之久，病房三十三人中弹，重病人两名因过度惊骇，致病势益危，玉兰村农民彭保珠被击伤。当蒋机低空扫射时，该院美国医生薛利支、甘曼尼、慕美佩三人目睹院内流弹四飞，病人惊相奔避，愤恨万分。据说自该院成立后，即曾将院址及成立经过电告北平及镇江联总机关，并已由新华社报导多次。该院为中国福利基金委员会主持人宋庆龄氏募捐及联总协助所创立之纯粹医务救济机关，已属中外共知，蒋机竟再三以其为袭击目标，实属惨无人道。现已联名由代副院长济仲桓氏，请镇江联总办事处向蒋方提出严重抗议。
    【新华社苏中前线廿七日电】蒋军于七月二十三日侵占如皋后，当即守住四门，规定老百姓只许进不准出，并限令商民于三日内一律开门营业，违者封门拆屋。但被迫开门的商家，原县政府门口夏永兴鞋店，满满三百双鞋子，刚开门就被一抢而空，所谓“慰劳难民”。如曾任伪镇长的祝贺、前伪情报主任张从厚、伪商会主任黄正华及当过伪军的钱国逊等，均被委为乡镇长。彼等得势后，诬西门六榆镇居民张敬余等六人莫须有的罪名“斩首示众”。定感寺黑牢中，已囚有无辜群众三十余人。民众被任意抓去修筑工事，仅东门老坝三十里路长一条街，即筑有大小碉堡二十余座。抓来民夫筑完工事后，即命令补充兵额。城郊数里之马头庄、瓦屋头、汪家巷等数十村庄，悉遭洗劫，所有庄稼均被视为障碍，强令一律砍光。二十五日傍晚，蒋军在瓦屋头某家捉鸡，一守家小孩拿住不放，他说：“新四军到这里，多少时候不曾拔一根鸡毛，你们一来就捉鸡。”蒋军恼羞成怒，拔出刺刀，对小孩胸部猛刺十数刀后，强夺鸡而去。詹氏才之妻被捆绑后，加以奸淫，当晚即悬梁自尽。
