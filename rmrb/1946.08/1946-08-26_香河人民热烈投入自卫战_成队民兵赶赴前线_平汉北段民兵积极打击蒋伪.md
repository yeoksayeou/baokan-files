　　Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 23rd: Our front-line reporter reports: The people of every village and town in Xianghe are enthusiastically engaged in the just war of self-defense. In recent days, the reporter has witnessed teams of militia coming from all over to participate in the war on the front lines of the North Canal. Shouldering rifles and carrying landmines, driving dozens of mule carts loaded with supplies, they marched to the self-defense positions, singing military songs with great enthusiasm. Men and women, old and young, along the river are calmly convinced that no matter how much the reactionaries rely on American guns and equipment, their sons and daughters will resolutely defend the North Canal. Although the artillery fire is continuous along the canal, villages such as Qianmazhuang, three or four miles from the embankment, are still working as usual. At a grand mass meeting, the old ladies waved their cattail leaf fans and nodded to the reporter, saying, "With you young lads (referring to the Eighth Route Army), folks are not afraid of American cannons and machine guns. Didn't the Japanese have these before? Weren't they all defeated by the Eighth Route Army?" The people warmly care for the soldiers defending their homeland. The reporter personally came into contact with the comfort groups, including five from the First District, two from the Fifth District, one from the Second District, and one organized by merchants from the city. In Koutou Village, Fifth District, more than forty women, each carrying two fat chickens and a basket of eggs, braved the sun to rush to the front lines to comfort the troops. During the fiercest fighting at the beginning of the month, the masses in more than forty villages in the Sixth District were fully mobilized to deliver food and water to the Eighth Route Army day and night and transfer the wounded soldiers. On August 5th, during the heavy rain in the Hutuo River, the shops in the city were afraid that the Eighth Route Army soldiers would catch a cold, so they raised 100 kilograms of white wine and a lot of ginger and pepper overnight and sent them to the front lines.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 23rd: Since July, the militia in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway have killed and wounded more than 250 Chiang and puppet troops in resisting the harassment and ravages of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. On June 25th, Chiang's 94th Division in Changxindian, in conjunction with puppet troops from Liulihe, Fangshan and other places, occupied Cijiawu, where the Liangxiang democratic government was located, and then sent a large number of armed secret agents to search and loot in various villages. The local masses could not bear it, so on July 7th, they cooperated with the Eighth Route Army to recover Cijiawu, annihilating more than 150 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and capturing more than 130 rifles. On July 13th, Yang Shouyan, the Kuomintang county magistrate of Xushui, led a part of the Chiang and puppet troops to break the dikes in Xiguan Huocun and other places, taking advantage of the rising river water, flooding more than ten villages including Dalizhuang and Liuzhuang, destroying more than 200 hectares of fertile land. When the masses beat gongs and gathered to rush to block the breach, they were again subjected to the Chiang and puppet troops' strafing. The nearby militia heard the news and gathered to repel the puppet troops who broke the dike, killing six of them. On July 18th, a battalion of Chiang's army in Caohe, Xushui, surrounded a certain village and used artillery and machine guns to cover nine assaults on the village, all of which were repelled by the militia. At 11:00 a.m., an armored car from Chiang's army in Xushui City came to reinforce. The militia immediately withdrew to the high houses in the village. When Chiang's army entered the center of the street, a dozen landmines exploded together, killing more than ten Chiang's soldiers, and the rest fled. On July 28th, more than 500 Chiang and puppet troops who occupied Chang @ (northwest of Fangshan) were also repelled by the local militia, and they were blocked by the militia along the way.
