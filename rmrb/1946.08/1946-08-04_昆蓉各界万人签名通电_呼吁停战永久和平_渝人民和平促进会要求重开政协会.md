    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] Chongqing News: Nearly ten thousand people from all walks of life in Kunming and Chengdu launched a large-scale signature campaign in early July, sending telegrams to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, calling for a permanent truce and the realization of long-term peace.

In addition, foreign goods flooded the market, production stagnated, and the economic crisis was on the verge of collapse. They pointed out that if the civil war continues to expand, it will once again lead to the tragic fate of being a colony, calling on the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to immediately announce a long-term truce, quickly provide relief to disaster areas, and discuss matters more quickly, and the plan should not be changed again, and its implementation should be most sincere.
