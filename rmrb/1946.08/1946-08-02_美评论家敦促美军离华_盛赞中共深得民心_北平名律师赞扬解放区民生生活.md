　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. San Francisco Broadcasting: American commentator Swin stated: The rise of Chinese reactionaries has caused many disturbances. They even assassinated leaders of the intellectual community. Those participating in democratic organizations and advocating democratic movements have been subjected to their destruction. Now the warmongers are launching a larger civil war. Swin continued: If a coalition government is not formed with the Communist Party and other political parties, a larger civil war will brew. He advocated that once a formal civil war breaks out, US troops must immediately leave China. Swin concluded: The CCP has gained the approval of the broad masses of the people, and the CCP will surely win.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 30th. Mr. Ya Fu (pseudonym), a famous lawyer from Beiping, recently traveled to the Hebei-Shanxi Liberated Area. Before leaving, he specially wrote an article for the Hebei-Shanxi Daily to express his impressions: What is absolutely unseen and has disappeared in the liberated area are "corrupt officials, local bullies," "escaped traitors," "foreign goods filling the market," "idle loafers," "prostitutes, gamblers," "illiterate people under the age of thirty," "barren fields," "torture and abuse," "adulterous daughters-in-law, beggars," "wandering monks and heretical religions," "people in strange costumes parading the streets," and more than a dozen other items. What exists can be summarized as "politics being simple, convenient, and fair, promoting civil rights," "officials and soldiers being gentle and considerate to people," "daily necessities being manufactured locally," "nothing being picked up from the road, doors not being closed at night," "newspapers being popular, freedom of speech," "men plowing and women weaving, having work to do," "the military and the people being one, officials and the people joining hands, truly becoming one," "every village having primary schools and cooperatives," and "publicizing finances from top to bottom," etc. Mr. "Ya Fu" used the example of Xiaoxiguan Village in Fuping, which he inspected, to prove this. Although the more than one hundred farm households in the village suffered heavy losses in the war, they have all risen to the level of middle peasants. Last winter, during the Lunar New Year, the whole village slaughtered a total of fifty to sixty large pigs, an average of one for every two households. Besides paying a small unified tax once a year, there are no other expenses. Men, women, old and young are dressed neatly. After organizing themselves every day, they go to the people's school together to study, and there are also musical instruments for performing operas and singing. In this village, the word "poverty" in the Kangxi Dictionary has been deleted.

    【新华社延安三十日电】旧金山广播：美评论家史温称：中国反动派的抬头，惹起了许多风波，他们甚至暗杀知识界领袖，参加民主组织及主张民主运动的人都遭受过他们的摧残，现在好战派展开更大的内战。史温继称：如果不与共产党及其他政党组成联合政府，就要酿成更大内战。渠主张一旦正式内战，美军须马上离开中国。史温结语称：中共取得了广大人民的赞同，中共一定能胜利。
    【新华社阜平三十日电】北平名律师亚夫（化名）先生日前来冀晋解放区游历，临离去时，特为冀晋日报撰文畅谈观感称：解放区绝对见不到和已绝迹的是“贪官、劣绅”、“漏网汉奸”、“充塞市场的外来品”、“游手好闲的二流子”、“娼妓、赌徒”、“三十岁以下不识字的人”、“荒芜的田园”、“非刑打骂”、“奸媳、乞丐”、“游僧邪教”、“奇装异服招摇过市者”等十几项，而有的可简括为“政治简便公允，发挥民权”、“官吏军人对人温和体贴”，“凡属日用品均可自造”，“路不失遗，夜不闭户”，“报纸风行，言论自由”，“男耕女织有工作”，“军民一体，官民携手，切实打成一片”，“各乡村皆有小学和合作社”，“上下财政公开”等。“亚夫”先生并以其所考察的阜平小西管村为例，予以证明，该村一百多户农家，虽在战争中遭受惨重损失，却都已上升为中农。去冬旧历年节，全村共宰了五六十口大猪，平均两家一口。负担除一年纳一次少许的统一税外，其余无丝毫花费。男女老幼穿着整洁，每日组织完毕相偕入民校学习，并有演戏歌唱等器乐。在此村，康熙字典中之“穷”字已被删除。
