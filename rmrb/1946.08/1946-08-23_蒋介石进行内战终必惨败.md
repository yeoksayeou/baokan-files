　　Chiang Kai-shek's Inevitable Defeat in the Civil War

[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] A Xinhua News Agency military reporter stated: Apart from all the political and economic difficulties, Chiang Kai-shek has the following insurmountable weaknesses in military terms alone, which will inevitably lead to his disastrous defeat in the civil war: (1) The contradiction between strategic intentions and military strength. Chiang Kai-shek has great ambitions. He wants the Central Plains, northern Jiangsu, Chengde, Andong, Harbin, to open up the Jiaoji Railway and the Tongpu Railway, and also to open up the land military transportation line from Nanjing via Jinan and Tianjin directly to Changchun. However, his total military strength is only 91 armies, 253 divisions. Now, 204 divisions (85% of his total military strength) are投入into the civil war, leaving only 49 divisions to guard the homeland. These 49 divisions include 14 divisions against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, as well as the Sichuan Army, Yunnan Army, and Ma Bufang's army in Qinghai, etc. Therefore, the actual military strength left to defend the fifteen or sixteen provinces in the rear is only 29 divisions. Chiang's forces are short of troops and exhausted of reserves. Even under the circumstances of his complete主动 advancement, he is already overwhelmed and stretched thin. Once he encounters the self-defense counterattacks of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, he becomes even more at a loss. The situation on the Longhai Front and the Tongpu Front recently fully proves this point. (2) The contradiction between tactical requirements and strategic intentions. Chiang Kai-shek has set this tactical operational principle for himself: concentrated maneuver. But he wants so many places, his targets are so dispersed, and the time is limited so short, while the capital in hand is very limited. Even if he can temporarily concentrate a considerable superior force on a certain area, at this time, many other areas will be full of flaws, creating conditions for the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to maneuver and gain advantages, creating victories in self-defense counterattacks. When Chiang's troops enter the Liberated Areas to fight, not only are they unfamiliar with the geography, but they also face the resistance of the entire people. Taking the Yangtze River coast in central Jiangsu and the Jinzhong plain area as examples: In the areas occupied by Chiang's troops, guerrillas and militiamen cooperate with our regular army to attack and harass everywhere, making Chiang's troops surrounded by enemies on all sides, struggling to cope, and the military strength is becoming more dispersed, and the maneuverability of operations is also reduced. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "concentrating forces" can only become a worthless dogma. (3) The contradiction between the Central Army and the "miscellaneous troops." Whether in the War of Resistance or the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek has always put the non-direct troops, which he regards as "miscellaneous," on the front line as cannon fodder to achieve his goal of eliminating dissidents. The experience of the Seventeenth Division in Henan is a typical example. In this so-called "reorganization," Chiang Kai-shek dismantled the organizational structure of the "miscellaneous troops" so thoroughly that the division commander could not find the brigade commander, and the commander could not control the troops. And the so-called "miscellaneous troops," whether the Northeast Army, the Northwest Army, the Yunnan Army, or the Sichuan Army, all have a glorious revolutionary history and fought bravely in the War of Resistance, which is much stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's direct troops who fled at the sight of the enemy in the Henan-Hunan campaign two years ago. Remembering the past and thinking about the present, who among the officers and soldiers of these "miscellaneous troops" is willing to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek, this dictator and traitor? (Number missing in original text). Chiang Kai-shek issued a series of three subjectivist orders. At the end of June, he wanted to annihilate Li Xiannian's troops within 48 hours. At the beginning of July, he decided (number missing in original text) to open up the Jiaoji Railway by August 15 and to open up the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Xuzhou to Jinan within two weeks... His subordinates knew that they could not achieve the tasks specified in the order in actual actions, so they had to adopt passive and怠工 methods to delay and搪塞 by claiming that the railway was not open and the enemy situation was unclear. However, once there is a setback, Chiang Kai-shek never knows how to "blame himself," but instead shifts the blame to his subordinates, issuing reprimands in general orders at best, and dismissing and investigating at worst, and if it goes wrong, he ends up with his head in a different place. In the Central Plains War, Fu Yan, commander of the 72nd Army, and Song Ruihe, commander of the 66th Army, were both reprimanded in general orders for "poor combat performance." Recently, Liang Hanming, commander of the 99th Army, and Ai Di, commander of the 92nd Division, were dismissed and investigated for the loss of the fishermen in northern Jiangsu. Even very senior commanders, such as commanders of war zones, cannot escape criticism. But if the "leader" himself comes to direct the battle, he will be even worse than those who have been reprimanded by him. There had already been a performance in the later stages of the Central Plains War. These situations naturally increased the dissatisfaction of his subordinates. Recently, war-weariness and anti-war sentiments are very high, and they have begun to渗透 from middle and lower-level officers to senior commanders. Xi Shengkai, deputy commander of the 92nd Division and major general, said: "In this Yugou battle, participating in the civil war, as soon as the gunshots rang, my mood dropped to zero... When the order was chaotic, the guards asked me how to deal with it, and I ordered them to lay down their weapons." Despite Chiang Kai-shek's repeated appeals: "Clarify responsibility and abide by discipline," the righteous actions of people like Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, Hao Pengju, Xi Shengkai, Liu Shanben, and Wang Haiqing, who either launched uprisings against the civil war or led soldiers to lay down their weapons, are increasing day by day. Even the first battalion of the 15th Transportation Column, which carries systematic transportation, also raised the banner of righteousness on the Jiaoji Railway. In addition, there are many tactical weaknesses. Because the division lacks justification and the soldiers lack morale, Chiang's troops are not good at bayonet fighting and night fighting, a point that even Bai Chongxi cannot deny. As far as American-equipped equipment is concerned, it should be an advantage, but in the hands of Chiang's army, it also produces weaknesses. The greater the degree of mechanization of weapons, the more ammunition is consumed, and the more necessary it is to have good transportation lines for mass supply. However, China has a vast territory and convenient transportation. When Chiang's troops enter the Liberated Areas to fight, Chiang's troops cannot use railways and highways due to the widespread destruction by the local people. And in Chiang Kai-shek's ruling area, although he has been calling for the restoration of transportation for a year, the transportation situation is still terrible. In addition, the weaknesses of unified command and internal strife are countless. The Xinhua News Agency military reporter concluded: Chiang Kai-shek knows neither the enemy nor himself. His desperate冒险 actions will inevitably lead to a tragic ending, which is predictable.

### 蒋介石进行内战终必惨败

　　蒋介石进行内战终必惨败
    【新华社延安十九日电】新华社军事记者称：蒋介石除了一切政治经济困难以外，单在军事上就有如下无法克服的弱点，使他所进行的内战终必惨遭失败：（一）战略意图与兵力的矛盾。蒋介石的野心很大，他要中原、要苏北、要承德、要安东、要哈尔滨、要打通胶济路、同蒲路，还要打通南京经济南天津直达长春的陆上军事交通线。然而他的全部兵力不过九十一个军，二百五十三个师，现在以二百○四个师（即全部兵力的百分之八十五）投入内战，只留下四十九个师看管老家，这四十九个师包括在新疆对少数民族十四个师，也包括川军、滇军、青海的马步芳军等等在内，所以留防守后方十五六省中的实际兵力，只有二十九个师。蒋方兵力短缺，后备枯竭，即在他完全主动进兵的情形下，已经顾此失彼，捉襟见肘，一碰到八路军新四军自卫反击，便更加手足无措。近日陇海前线与同蒲前线的情况，就充分证明此点（二）战术要求与战略意图的矛盾。蒋介石给他自己定出这么一条战术作战原则：集中机动。但他想要的地方这么多，目标这么分散，时间又限得这么短促，而手中的资本却有限得很，即或能暂时对某一地区集中相当优势的兵力，但此时在其他许多地区就破绽百出，造成八路军新四军机动地取得优势条件，造成自卫反击的胜利。蒋军进入解放区里面作战，不仅地理不熟，而且所面临的是全民的反抗。以苏中长江沿岸和晋中平川地区为例：在蒋军侵占地区，游击队、民兵配合我正规军到处袭击困扰，使蒋军四面受敌，穷于应付，兵力愈加分散，作战的机动性也愈减少。蒋介石所谓“集中兵力”，只能变成一文不值的教条。（三）中央军和“杂牌军”的矛盾。无论抗战、内战，蒋介石都把他目为“杂牌”的非嫡系部队放在第一线当炮灰，以达到其消灭异己的目的。十七师在河南的遭遇，就是一个标本例子。在这次所谓“整编”中，蒋介石把“杂牌军”的编制拆得稀烂，东一团，西一旅，弄得师长找不到旅长，指挥官不能掌握部队。而所谓“杂牌军”，无论东北军、西北军、滇军、川军，都有光荣的革命历史，在抗战中曾英勇作战，较诸在前年豫湘战役中望风而逃的蒋介石嫡系部队要强的多，抚今思昔，这些“杂牌军”官兵谁又甘心为蒋介石这个独夫卖国贼作内战的炮灰（中缺数字）。蒋介石下了一连三的主观主义的命令，六月末是四十八小时内歼灭李先念部，七月初决定（中缺数字）又要限期八月十五打通胶济路，二周内贯通徐州到济南的津浦路……他的部下在实际行动中明知无法达到命令所指定的任务，只有采取消极怠工办法，以铁路不通敌情不明等等拖延搪塞。可是，一遇失利，蒋介石从来不知道“罪己”，反把罪责诿诸部属，轻则通令训斥，重则撤职查办，闹得不好落一个身首异处。中原之战，七十二军军长傅言，六十六军军长宋瑞河均被以“作战不力”罪名通令训斥。最近苏北渔民失利九十九军军长梁汉溟，九十二师师长艾地，均遭撤职查办，甚至很高级的指挥员如战区司令长官者之流，亦无法免受斥骂。但要“领袖”自己来直接指挥一下看，却要比那些受他训斥的人更加不行。中原战事的后期，已经有过表演，这些情形，自然更增加了部下的不满。最近厌战反战情绪很高，开始由中下级军官渗透到高级指挥官身上，九十二师副师长洗盛楷少将说：“此次渔沟战役中，参加内战，枪声一响，我心绪即降到零点……当秩序紊乱时，卫士问我如何处理，我即下令放下武器。”尽管蒋介石一再大声疾呼：“明责任，守纪律”，但如高树勋、潘朔端、郝鹏举、洗盛楷、刘善本、王海清等那样，或举行反内战的起义，或领导士兵放下武器的正义行动，正在一天天增多，甚至连载的系统的交通第十五纵队第一大队，亦在胶济路上高举义旗。加之战术上弱点很多，由于师出无名，士无斗志，蒋军不善白刃战和夜战，这一点连白崇禧都不能不承认。就美械装备说来，应该是个优点，但在蒋军手中，同时产生了弱点。武器机械化程度愈大，弹药的消耗愈多，愈须有良好的交通线来大量供应，但是，中国幅员辽阔，交通方便，蒋军进入解放区作战，在当地人民广泛破击之下，蒋军无法使用铁路公路，而在蒋介石的统治区，虽然他喊了一年恢复交通，交通情形还是糟得不堪。此外为指挥不统一，内部互相倾轧其弱点，可谓不胜枚举。新华社军事记者最后称：蒋介石既不知彼，又不知己，他的孤注一掷的冒险行动，必然遭到悲惨的结局，是可以预卜的。
