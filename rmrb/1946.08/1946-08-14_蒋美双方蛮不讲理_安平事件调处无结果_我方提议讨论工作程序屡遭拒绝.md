　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Beiping dispatch: The special team that departed on the 8th to investigate the Anping Incident has returned to Beiping without any results. On the morning of the 9th, the team held a meeting at the Beiping Executive Headquarters. The Chiang and US sides continued to reject discussions on the team's investigation and the Chinese Communist side's proposed procedural issues with an arrogant and unreasonable attitude, preventing the team from truly beginning consultations. The investigation procedure proposed by the Chinese Communist side was exceptionally straightforward: First, listen to the report from the representative of the US Marine Corps Headquarters. Second, go to the Communist-controlled areas to listen to the reports from the local military authorities of the Communist side. Third, listen to the reports from the local military authorities of the government. Fourth, determine the speakers for the three parties to be heard. Fifth, other necessary measures. Sixth, summarize the investigation and write a report, and the three committee members will release the news. However, the US chairman and the Chiang side's representatives fundamentally refused to discuss this suggestion. Their purpose was to force the Chinese Communist representatives to blindly act without procedure or plan, and to listen to their unreasonable dictates in everything. They also attempted to use the report of a person unilaterally designated by the US side as material for the 25-member team to conduct deceptive propaganda to the world. This conspiracy has been exposed by the Chinese Communist representatives on the spot. The Chinese Communist representative, Committee Member Ye, and the US representative, Committee Member Rao, had agreed that the team should first agree on the working procedures, and that the report from the US Marine Corps representative could be heard first when the procedures were being determined. However, by the afternoon of the 8th, when the 25th team continued to meet, the US representative still unreasonably refused to discuss the working procedures and tried to immediately begin listening to the report of the person unilaterally decided by the US side, according to the trap predetermined by the US side of the team. Therefore, the afternoon team meeting still had no results.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Beiping dispatch: The special team formed to investigate the Anping conflict held its third team meeting on the morning of the 6th. The Chinese Communist representative, Major General Huang Yifeng, proposed an investigation procedure, including the following four locations: namely, the US Marine Corps Headquarters in Tianjin, the Tianjin Government Army Headquarters, the Chinese Communist Army Headquarters, and the location of the incident. In addition to immediately departing for Tianjin, the team should immediately dispatch a liaison group to the area where the incident occurred to establish contact with the Chinese Communist Army Headquarters. According to the purpose of this proposal, it was to enable the team to depart quickly and take care of the US side's request for security guarantees, but Davis did not consider it at all. At the meeting on the 6th, when the Chinese Communist representative raised the investigation procedure for the fourth time, the US representative, Davis, adopted a completely unreasonable and arrogant attitude, insisting on the so-called chairman's prerogative to summon witnesses he himself designated to the meeting to listen to reports. When discussing the team's action plan, after repeated explanations and multiple protests by the Chinese Communist representative, Davis ignored them due to his autocratic arrogance and lack of the spirit of equality and democracy, resulting in the special team meeting on the morning of the 6th ending without results.

　　蒋美双方蛮不讲理            
    安平事件调处无结果           
    我方提议讨论工作程序屡遭拒绝
　　【新华社延安十一日电】北平讯：八日下午出发调查安平事件的特别小组，无任何结果，已返回北平。九日上午，小组在北平执行部开会，蒋美双方继续以蛮横无理的态度拒绝讨论小组调查及中共方面提议讨论程序问题，以使小组真正开始协商。中共方面所提议的调查程序异常简明：第一，听取美海军陆战队司令部之代表的报告。第二，往中共地区听取中共地方军事当局的报告。第三，听取政府地方军事当局报告。第四，确定三方之听取人报告。第五，其他必要之措施。第六，总结调查做报告，三委员公布新闻。然而这个建议美方主席及蒋方代表根本拒绝讨论，其目的在于压迫中共代表在无程序无计划的盲目行动下，一切听其无理支配，并且企图以美方片面指定的人报告，作为二十五小组的材料，向全世界进行欺骗宣传，这个阴谋已经中共代表当场揭露。中共叶委员与美方饶委员，曾商定小组应先商定工作程序，在规定程序时，可以先听取美陆战队代表报告。但至八日下午，第二十五小组继续开会时，美代表依然无理拒绝讨论工作程序，力图依照小组美方事先确定好的圈套，立刻开始听取美方片面决定的人之报告，因此下午小组会议仍未有任何结果。
    【新华社延安十一日电】北平讯：为调查安平冲突而组成的特别小组，六日晨举行第三次小组会议，中共代表黄逸峰少将提议调查程序，包括下述四处：即天津美陆战队司令部，天津政府军司令部，中共军司令部及出事地点。小组除立即出发天津外，应即时派遣一连络组前往出事地区，与中共军司令部建立联络。按此次提议目的，在使小组迅速出发及照顾美方安全保证之要求，戴维斯始终不加考虑。六日会上，当中共代表第四次提出调查程序时，美代表戴维斯采取完全无理蛮横态度，坚持所谓主席特权，召集其自行指定之证明人到会，听取报告。谈商小组行动计划时，经中共代表再三说明，多次抗议，因戴维斯独断横蛮及毫无平等民主之精神置之不理，致六日晨特别小组会议无结果。
