　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. Moscow Radio commentator Massinu, citing Chinese and foreign commentary on the current situation in China, pointed out that the Marshall-Stuart joint statement added fuel to the fire of the Chinese civil war and marked the beginning of the second stage of US armed intervention in China. Massinu stated: The Chinese civil war is rapidly spreading throughout the country. Chinese democrats have repeatedly pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionaries are the culprits behind the expansion of the civil war. They also emphasized that the CCP's resolute implementation of self-defense actually demonstrates its intention to strive for peace and make sufficient concessions. A broadcast from the New York radio station on August 11th pointed out the opinions of some well-informed sources in China that the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have reached a stalemate, which is the result of the Kuomintang's decision to use force to crush the Communists. However, Chinese democrats have pointed out that the targets of the Kuomintang reactionaries' offensive are not only the Communist Party, but also the implementation of terror tactics against all Chinese democrats, which is progressing simultaneously with the expansion of the civil war. Chinese democrats believe that the Marshall-Stuart joint statement that "a complete cessation of military action throughout China is no longer possible" has significant meaning. The role played by American peaceful mediation has not surprised Chinese democrats. Soong Ching Ling stated that "American reactionaries and Chinese reactionaries cooperate and encourage each other." According to the opinion published by US Congressman Patterson in Congress on July 26th, the main method of this encouragement is the so-called "mediation." The Kuomintang government used Marshall's mediation and the conclusion of a truce agreement to redeploy and replenish its forces, launching offensives against the Communist Party and democratic forces opposed to Chiang Kai-shek. Patterson stated: The so-called truce agreement was also used to strengthen and improve American assistance to the Nanjing government. He concluded: After gaining all the benefits during the truce, the Kuomintang army resumed its frantic civil war. Chinese democrats pointed out that, in this situation, the Marshall-Stuart joint statement not only continued to expose the US policy of interfering in China, but also encouraged the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch new offensives. Therefore, Chinese democrats pointed out the importance of the Kuomintang bombing Yan'an with American-made aircraft. In North China, conflicts occurred between Chinese and US Marines, and new military operations occurred in North and Central China immediately after the US State Department issued a statement that it would not change its China policy. Therefore, the Marshall-Stuart joint statement added fuel to the fire of the Chinese civil war.
    Chinese democrats also summarized the domestic situation, saying: Since the Japanese surrender a year ago, the Chinese reactionaries immediately attempted to use force to resolve the issue of dictatorship or democracy, but encountered strong resistance from democratic forces. This is the real reason why the US Marines landed in North China last November. The first stage of American intervention in China began in this way. Chinese democrats pointed out that the Marshall-Stuart joint statement caused new and huge conflicts in North and Central China, proving that it was the beginning of the second stage of US armed intervention in China.
    The Overseas Chinese Daily wrote: We must warn these war instigators with a saying once said by Sun Yat-sen: "The armed forces created by the collusion between warlords and imperialism will surely fail!" The newspaper continued: "If the Kuomintang warlords insist on carrying out their evil conspiracy, then they will be wiped out by the huge force of the Chinese people, just like Chinese warlords such as Yuan Shikai, Duan Qirui, and Wu Peifu."

　　马西努指出
    马歇尔、司徒雷登的联合声明，是美国武装干涉中国第二阶段的开始。
    【新华社延安十四日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努引证中外舆论对中国现状的评论，指出马歇尔与司徒雷登的联合声明，使中国内战火上加油，并且是美国武装干涉中国第二阶段的开始。马氏称：中国内战正在迅速普遍全国，中国民主人士再三指出国民党反动派是扩大内战的祸首，他们并着重指出中共坚决实行自卫，实际上表示力谋达成和平的意图，实行足够的让步。纽约无线电台八月十一日广播指出驻中国的某些消息灵通人士的意见，国共二党的谈判已陷僵局，这是国民党决定用武力粉碎共产党人的结果。但中国民主人士都指出国民党反动派进攻的对象不只是共产党，而且与扩大内战同时并进的是实行恐怖手段，反对中国全体民主分子。中国民主人士认为马歇尔与司徒雷登的“在中国全境完全停止军事行动已不可能”的联合声明有重大的意义，美国和平调解所起的作用并没有使中国民主人士发生惊异。宋庆龄声明说“美国反动派与中国反动派相互合作彼此鼓励”，据美国众议员柏德逊七月二十六日在国会公布的意见，此种鼓励的主要方法就是所谓“调停”。国民党政府利用马歇尔调停与缔结停战协定以便重新配置与补充自己的兵力，向共产党及反对蒋介石的民主力量，举行进攻。柏德逊称：所谓停战协定，还被利用加强改进美国对于南京政府的帮助。他结论称：在停战时期取得全部利益之后，国民党军队又重新开始疯狂的内战。中国民主人士指出，在这种情况下，马、司联合声明不仅是继续暴露了美国干涉中国的政策，而且是鼓励国民党反动派进行新的进攻。因此中国民主人士指出国民党用美制飞机轰炸延安的重要性。在华北，中国与美海军陆战队发生冲突，以及在美国务院发表不改变对华政策声明后，马上在华北华中发生新的军事行动。因此马、司联合声明对于中国内战是火上加油。
    中国民主人士并总结国内局势说：从日本投降一年以来，中国反动派马上企图用武力解决专政或民主的问题，但是遇到了民主力量的强大反抗，这就是去年十一月美海军陆战队在华北登陆的真正原因，美国干涉中国的第一阶段就是这样开始的。中国民主人士指出马、司联合声明使华北与华中发生新的巨大冲突，证明是美国武装干涉中国第二阶段的开始。
    华侨日报对此写道：我们必须警告这些战争挑拨者以孙中山曾说过的一句话：“军阀与帝国主义阴谋合作所造成的武装力量一定会失败的！”该报继称：“假使国民党军阀坚持实行自己罪恶的阴谋，那末它将会像袁世凯、段祺瑞，吴佩孚等中国军阀一样，会被中国人民的庞大力量铲除净尽。”
