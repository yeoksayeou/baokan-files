Representatives from various newspaper distribution and publishing units then spoke one after another, discussing countermeasures. More than 30 units attended the symposium, including Wuzhou Bookstore, Era Publishing House, China Book Company, Zhoubao News Agency, Wencui Society, and Democracy Weekly.
