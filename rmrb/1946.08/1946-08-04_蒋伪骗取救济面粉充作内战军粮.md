【Heze, 30th Dispatch】 The Kuomintang authorities in Northern Jiangsu, in collaboration with puppet troops, fraudulently obtained relief flour and used it as military rations for the civil war. Wu Pinshan's puppet troops, entrenched in Jing'anji (50 li northwest of Xuzhou) in Northern Jiangsu, have ravaged the area bordering Pei County and Yutai in Jiangsu and Shandong for many years, causing severe famine. After Wu, a traitor, was incorporated into the Chiang Kai-shek army, he actively engaged in the civil war. Recently, he attacked Feng County and Pei County in Northern Jiangsu. In order to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek army, this traitor shamelessly defrauded relief flour by falsely claiming the famine he himself had created and applying to the relief administration for aid. The Kuomintang authorities simultaneously carried out deception, and the relief administration approved a large amount of supplies to relieve the refugees in Northern Jiangsu. On the 11th, 14th, and 15th of this month, 9,000 bags of flour were transported from Xuzhou to Jing'anji on the front lines of the civil war. Wu and Kuomintang officials temporarily drove tens of thousands of civilians within dozens of li around the area who were building fortifications, pretending that they were refugees to receive the relief flour, which was then moved into military granaries. Furthermore, they selected fleeing local bullies from the "Refugee Repatriation Corps" organized by special agents, posing them as refugee representatives to deceive foreign personnel from UNRRA distributing relief supplies with flowery words. After this shameful farce of defrauding grain was staged, the vast disaster-stricken people in the local area who were crying out for food were extremely indignant.

　　蒋伪骗取救济面粉充作内战军粮
    【荷泽三十日电】苏北国民党当局协同伪军骗取救济面粉充作内战军粮。盘据苏北敬安集（徐州西北五十里）之伪军吴品山部，蹂躏苏鲁边沛县鱼台一带多年，造成严重灾荒。吴逆自被蒋军收编后，积极从事内战，最近，进攻我苏北丰县沛县。该逆竟为配合蒋军，无耻骗取救济面粉，乃以其一手造成之灾荒，向救济总署声请救济。国民党当局同时进行瞒哄，救济总署乃批准大量物资救济苏北难民，于本月十一、十四、十五三日由徐州运送面粉九千袋至内战前线的敬安集，吴逆及国民党官员临时驱使周围数十里内正在修筑工事之数万民夫，冒充难民领取救济面粉，旋即搬入军粮仓库，又由特务组织的“难民还乡团”中抽选逃亡恶霸，冒充难民代表，以花言巧语蒙蔽发放救济粮之联总外籍人员。在此项骗粮丑剧演出后，当地嗷嗷待哺之广大灾民愤恨异常。
