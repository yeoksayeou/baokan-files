Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. On June 24th, a mutiny of several hundred Kuomintang cavalry soldiers broke out in Qinghai. According to the Xikang Daily of June 26th: In Yushu County, Qinghai, there were originally more than 800 garrisoned troops. Because they had been deducted from by superiors over the years and received meager treatment, they were unable to make a living. They thus launched a mutiny on the 24th, led by Battalion Commander Yang Rongxu, first killing the local garrison commander Sun Burong, County Magistrate Wei, Commissioner Lin, and four others. Immediately, they led all their men to transfer to the Xikang border. On the 25th, when they were only 120 li away from Dengke County in Xikang, they were blocked by Kuomintang troops, so they turned into Gansu. Currently, the unit is still stationed in Tao County. It is reported that the Kuomintang authorities have now sent two more battalions of troops to "suppress" them.

    青海蒋军一部兵变
    【新华社延安一日电】六月二十四日，青海爆发数百国民党骑兵之兵变。据六月二十六日西康日报载：青海玉树县，原有驻军八百余名，因历年受上级克扣，待遇菲薄，无法生活，乃于二十四日发生兵变，由营长杨荣绪率领，先将当地警备司令官孙步荣、县长魏某、专员林某等七人枪杀。随即率领全部人马向西康境转移，二十五日抵距西康邓科县仅一百二十里时，因遭国民党部队堵击，遂折入甘肃，刻该部仍驻扎洮县境内。闻国民党当局现又派军两营“进剿”。
