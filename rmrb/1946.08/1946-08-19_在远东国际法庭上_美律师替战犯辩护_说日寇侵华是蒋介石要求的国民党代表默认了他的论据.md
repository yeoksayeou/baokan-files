Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: At the Far East International Tribunal on the 13th, during the trial of Japanese war criminals for their invasion of China in the "July 7th Incident," Smith, the American lawyer defending the war criminals, argued that the Japanese invasion of China was "legal" and had the consent of the Nationalist government. He said, "Chiang Kai-shek had requested cooperation from Japan, even after the 'July 7th Incident.'" The Nationalist representatives present at the court did not speak, tacitly approving Smith's argument, which caused the war criminals to burst into laughter.

Chief Prosecutor Kote, as a witness to the Japanese invasion of North China, was questioned by Smith, the defense lawyer for the war criminals, who asked, "Are you proving that Japan was legal in North China, or are you proving that Japan was an aggressor?" Kote said, "Japan's actions in North China were wrong." Smith then made a brazenly fabricated statement, "Then why did you tell me at my lodging three weeks ago that there were many reasons for Japan's occupation of Manchuria and North China?" The war criminals laughed again at this point. Kote firmly denied that this had ever happened, saying, "I have never met you."

In a moment of overbearing arrogance, Smith said, "The Jidong Autonomous Government was to protect the lives of Japanese residents from the Communists who were spreading throughout North China..." Chief Prosecutor Keenan immediately stood up to stop him. But Smith wanted to continue speaking, and Keenan refuted him sternly again. However, Webb, the chief judge of the court that day, actually aided the evildoers, protesting Keenan's actions in stopping the war criminal's defense lawyer. A dispute immediately arose between Keenan and Webb, and Webb adjourned the meeting.

　　在远东国际法庭上
    美律师替战犯辩护
    说日寇侵华是蒋介石要求的国民党代表默认了他的论据
    【新华社延安十六日电】东京讯：十三日远东国际法庭上审讯“七七事变”日寇侵略我国罪行，战犯的美籍辩护律师史密斯振振有词，认为日寇侵略我国是“合法”的，是得到国民党政府的同意。他说：“蒋介石曾要求日本合作，即在‘七七事变’后亦然。”出席法庭的国民党代表竟未发言，默认史密斯的论据，一时战犯们哄然大笑。法庭首席检查官高特做为日寇侵略我华北的见证人，发言时战犯辩护律师史密斯竟又诘问高特道：“你是证明日本在华北是合法呢，抑是证明日本是侵略呢？”高特道：“日本在华北的行为是不对的。”史密斯更无赖地造谣道：“那么在三星期前你到我旅舍找我时，又为什么说日本占满洲和华北是有许多理由的？”战犯于此时又哈哈大笑，高特坚决否认有此事，他说：“我从未见过你。”史密斯在得意忘形时竟说：“冀更自治政府是为了从蔓延华北的中共手里保护日侨生命。……”检查长吉楠当即起来制止。但史密斯却又要继续发言，吉楠便又严予驳斥。可是法庭当天的首席法官韦勃竟助纣为虐，对吉楠制止战犯辩护律师的行动提出抗议，顿时发生吉楠与韦勃的争论，韦勃即宣告休会。
