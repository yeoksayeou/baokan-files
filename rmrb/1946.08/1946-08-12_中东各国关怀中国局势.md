　　Middle Eastern Countries Concerned About the China Situation
　　Report by British Journalist Gan Bei'er
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th】 Reuters correspondent Gan Bei'er reported on July 16th: Foreigners are extraordinarily concerned about the situation in China. Recently, when I passed through Iran, Egypt, Palestine, Iraq, India, and other places, people inquired about the situation in China. The King of Transjordan, less than two days after his enthronement, inquired of me about the situation in China. A confidant of the Iranian Prime Minister Sultani also asked me whether the situation in China was as bad as generally reported. I dare say that the Arab world and other Middle Eastern and Far Eastern nations feel surprised and disappointed about the situation in China. They do not want to hear words like "secret police" and "Gestapo" from the Hitler era again. They hope that journalists will bring them good news of peaceful reform and revival in China.

　　中东各国关怀中国局势
　　英记者甘贝尔报导            
    【新华社延安九日电】路透社特派员甘贝尔七月十六日报导：国外人士对中国局势异常关切，记者最近经过伊朗、埃及、巴勒斯坦、伊拉克、印度等地时，都有人向我探询中国的情形。外约旦王登基后不到两天，就向记者打听中国情形。伊总理苏尔丹尼的亲信，也向我询问中国局势是否如一般报导之劣。我敢说，阿拉伯世界和其他中东、远东的诸民族，他们对于中国的局势，都感到奇突和失望。他们不愿再听到“秘密警察”、“盖斯塔波”等希特勒时代的名词，他们希望记者们带给他们中国已有和平改革复兴的好消息。
