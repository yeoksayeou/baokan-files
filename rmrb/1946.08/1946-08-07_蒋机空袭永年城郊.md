　　【Handan, 3rd Dispatch】On the 30th of last month, fifteen Chiang Kai-shek planes, from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM, bombed peaceful villages in the outskirts of Yongnian City in seven waves. Each time, one to five planes indiscriminately bombed and strafed, and dropped a large number of incendiary bombs, resulting in the destruction of more than 200 houses in villages within ten li of the city, causing numerous casualties among residents. On the same day, the Yongnian group, upon receiving the report, had American representative Major McKee, accompanied by representatives from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, travel by car to Nanjiao Village near Yongnian at 11:00 AM to investigate. They witnessed the disaster suffered by the peaceful residents who were bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. At 12:30 PM, as they were about to go to other villages to investigate, Chiang Kai-shek's planes launched a fifth bombing raid, with more than ten bombs, half of which were incendiary bombs, landing near the location where the group members and their cars were parked. Major McKee and others were almost in danger. The planes then bombed and strafed villages along the route, lasting about 40 minutes. At 2:00 PM, the group intended to go to other villages to investigate, but due to the continuous bombing by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, and especially because Kuomintang representative Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaozheng resolutely refused to investigate further, the group hastily returned to Handan before the sixth bombing raid. However, Kuomintang representative Zhang Zhongxiao denied this fact, and sophistically argued that "it was because our side shot at the Kuomintang planes that they launched a major bombing raid." After a stern rebuttal by our representative, the American representative also said that they should have a conscience towards the people of Yongnian. It is reported that the group has decided to report to the Executive Headquarters for resolution.

　　蒋机空袭永年城郊
    【邯郸三日电】上月三十日蒋机十五架，自早晨六时至下午二时，分七次空袭我永年城郊和平村庄。每次一架至五架不等，滥施轰炸扫射，且投下大量燃烧弹，以致距城十余里内各村民房，被炸毁者达二百余座之多，居民死伤甚众。当日上午永年小组据报后，即由美方代表麦奇少校会同国共两代表乘汽车于上午十一时赶到永年附近之南桥村调查，目睹和平居民遭蒋机轰炸所受灾难情形，至十二时半，正拟前往其他各村调查，又值蒋机第五次轰炸，小组人员及汽车停息处亦落弹十余枚，半数为燃烧弹，麦奇少校等亦几遭危险。该机复于沿村等村轮番轰炸扫射，历时约四十分钟。下午二时余，小组拟再赴他村调查，但因蒋机轮番轰炸，特别因国方代表张朝正中校坚决拒绝再调查，小组始于第六次轰炸前遄返邯郸。但国方代表张中校却抹煞此种事实，仍诡辩“因我方射击国机才来大施轰炸”，经我方代表严正驳斥后，美方代表亦说对永年人民应有良心。闻小组已决定具报执行部解决云。
