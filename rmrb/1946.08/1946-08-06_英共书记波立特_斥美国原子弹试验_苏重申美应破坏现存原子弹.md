　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: London News: British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt, in a speech in Newcastle on the 28th, pointed out that during the entire period of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' meeting preparing for the Paris Peace Conference, the United States had been striving to perfect its atomic bombs. The purpose of these experiments was to remind Britain and the Soviet Union: "We have succeeded, and you have not." This is clearly an American policy of intimidation that is consistent with that country's attitude towards its own working class and its pursuit of aggressive imperialist goals. The Paris Conference needs to remember the power of the working class, and ask American businessmen like Byrnes to remember. In the final analysis, only the working class has the deciding voice on the question of peace or war, and the workers' answer will undoubtedly be peace. If the Labour government's foreign policy were determined by socialist principles rather than imperialist principles, if our country had truly tried to cooperate with the Soviet Union and the new Europe, and truly cooperate with labor and democratic forces, then the current serious international situation would not have arisen. It would have reached a point where Byrnes could not implement his current policy.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: New York News: Soviet representative Gromyko declared at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission on the 1st that the Soviet Union believes that the international inspection system proposed by the United States to determine whether any country is attempting to use atomic bombs for war would be an "infringement on national independence." Gromyko explained in detail that the Soviet Union believes that this phenomenon cannot guarantee peace and security. Gromyko said: The Soviet Union proposed that it would support international action against any country being destroyed by an atomic energy convention, but the Soviet Union believes that the success or failure of any convention prohibiting atomic warfare will depend on the sincerity and willingness of the countries concerned to cooperate. Gromyko then reiterated that the United States should destroy all existing atomic bombs, without waiting for an international decision on control measures.

    斥美国原子弹试验
    苏重申美应破坏现存原子弹
    【新华社延安二日电】伦敦讯：英共总书记波立特，于二十八日在新堡演说，提示在四强外长集会准备巴黎和会的整个期间美国曾竭力使其原子炸弹更臻完备，这些实验的目的，在新提醒英国和苏联说：“我们已经得手了而你们还没有”。这很清楚是美国的恫吓政策是与该国对其本国的工人阶级的态度与其对侵略的帝国主义目标的追求的传统符合一致的。巴黎会议需要记取工人阶级的力量，请贝纳斯之流的美国商人记取。归根说来，关于和平还是战争问题，只有工人阶级才有决定的发言权，工人的回答将是和平，这一点是毫无疑问的。如果工党政府的外交政策是由社会主义原则而非以帝国主义原则所决定的话，如果我国真正曾试图与苏联及新的欧洲真正合作，与劳工和民主势力真正合作的话，那么目前严重的国际形势不可能发生的。这样就会达到这样的地步，即贝纳斯不可能执行其现行政策。
    【新华社延安二日电】纽约讯：苏代表葛罗米柯于一日在联合国原子能委员会上宣称：苏联认为美国所建议之国际视察制度以决是否有任何国家企图利用原子弹进行战争一点，将是“侵犯国家之独立”。葛氏详细解释称：苏联认为这种现象不能保障和平与安全。葛氏说：苏联提出它将支持反对任何国家被破坏原子能公约之国际行动，但苏联认为禁止原子战争任何公约之成败，将决于有关各国合作之诚意与愿望。葛氏继即重申美国应毁坏一切现存原子弹，而不要等待国际关于管制办法之决定。
