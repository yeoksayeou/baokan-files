Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th – The Shanghai Millard's Review on July 27th exposed a farce directed by Kuomintang secret service chief Gu Zhenggang, who played the role of "Northern Jiangsu Refugee." It stated: The "Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Center" in Zhenjiang, presided over by Minister Gu Zhenggang, requested 500,000 bags of flour from UNRRA and convened a meeting of upper-class figures from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang. UNRRA personnel were not invited to participate in the "discussion" of the distribution of relief supplies. The Baojia chiefs submitted a list of those who should be "relieved." On the first day of distributing relief supplies, many people wearing fine clothes and gold jewelry came and hired laborers to carry the flour. The first was a woman, particularly beautifully dressed, who said she had left Northern Jiangsu a year ago and had lived in Huaiyin. She is now married to a patrol officer and wants to collect relief grain for her family of seven. The second woman, wearing silk clothes and gold jewelry, is the mistress of a businessman in Zhenjiang. A relative of hers is from Huaiyin, so she also received a relief certificate.

    阔人称难民搬运救济面
    【新华社延安六日电】七月廿七日上海密勒氏评论报揭发国民党特务头子谷正纲扮演“苏北难民”的一幕丑剧称：谷正纲部长所主持的镇江“苏北难民救济处”，向联总要求五十万袋面粉，召集京沪镇江上层人士开会，联总人员未被邀请参加“讨论”救济物资分配问题，由保甲长提出了应“救济”的名单。在分配救济物资的第一天来了很多穿的很阔气的戴着金首饰的人，雇了苦力来搬运面粉。第一个是女人，穿得特别漂亮，他说在一年前离开苏北，曾经住过淮阴，他现在嫁了一个巡官，要领他一家七口的救济粮。第二个女人穿着绸衣戴着金首饰，是镇江某商人的姘妇，他有一个亲戚是淮阴人，所以也得到了救济证。
