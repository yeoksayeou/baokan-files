Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. Shenyang Correspondence: The people on the streets of Shenyang are scarce, but the "orders" posted on the walls are numerous and lively. "Orders," "orders," everywhere are "orders" from the "Shenyang Garrison Headquarters." "Shenyang Can Zi No. 54" order states: "1. Hereafter, without permission, the people are not allowed to assemble or form groups. 2. Without permission, parades and demonstrations are not allowed." Not far away is the "Shenyang Garrison Headquarters' Measures for Registration and Guidance of Mass Organizations," which stipulates that all mass organizations must submit their constitutions and detailed resumes of their responsible persons to the headquarters within one week. Failure to report within the deadline or inaccurate reporting will result in the headquarters taking action to ban them. Groups that have been approved and registered by the headquarters must apply to the headquarters for approval before holding any gatherings or activities. Farmers are not even allowed to hold temple fairs. "Shen Bei Can Zi No. 20" order states: "Burning incense and gathering crowds, roads congested with vehicles and horses, and merchants gathering are extremely disruptive to public order." Therefore, "all temples are prohibited from holding temple fairs." What they prefer is "public order" with merchants and travelers hesitating to set foot in the area, and what they hate is "roads congested with vehicles and horses, and merchants gathering." Bulletin No. 169 of the She Zi says: "According to the telegram order from the Northeast Headquarters and the Commander-in-Chief of the Security Forces, it is forbidden to plant tall crops (sorghum and corn) within ten li on both sides of the railway. If anyone neglects this and plants them arbitrarily, once discovered, in addition to ordering their removal, they will be severely punished." The Northeast railway transportation network covers the entire territory. The order prohibits planting the main food crops of sorghum and corn within twenty li along the railway. It is unknown how millions of farmers will survive. Not allowing the people to assemble or form groups, not allowing free exchange of products, and not allowing free cultivation of crops - this is the "benevolent governance" of the Chiang Kai-shek group after "taking over" the Northeast and exercising "sovereignty."

　　请看今日之沈阳
　　不准人民集会结社不准自由交换生产品不准农民自由种庄稼
    【新华社延安十九日电】沈阳通讯：沈阳市上人民是稀少了，但是墙上贴着的“命令”却很热闹。“命令”，“命令”，到处都是“沈阳警备司令部”的“命令”。在“沈阳参字第五四号”的命令上写着：“一、今后非经许可，人民不准集会结社。二、非经许可不准游行示威。”走不多远又是“警备司令部举办民众团体登记指导办法”的“命令”，其中规定：所有民众团体须在一周内把组织章程和负责人的详细经历送交司令部，如逾期不报或呈报不准确的，本司令部得予取缔。凡经本司令部核准登记的团体，如有集会活动，应当事先报请本司令部核准后，方得进行。农民要举行庙会也不行，“沈备参字第二○号”的命令中说：“焚香聚众，车马塞途，商贩麇集，极感紊乱治安”，因此“各庙一律禁办庙会。”他们喜欢的是商旅裹足的“治安”，憎恨的是“车马塞途，商贩麇集”。社字第一六九号布告说：“奉东北行营及保安司令长官部电令，铁路两侧各十华里内不准种植高杆作物（高粱和玉米），倘着玩忽，任意种植，一经发觉，除令铲除外，当严惩不贷。”东北铁路交通纵横布满全境，命令沿铁路二十里内不准种主要食粮的高粱玉米，不知千百万的农民怎么活。不准人民集会结社，不准自由交换生产品，不准自由种庄稼，这就是蒋介石集团“接收”东北，行使“主权”后的“德政”。
