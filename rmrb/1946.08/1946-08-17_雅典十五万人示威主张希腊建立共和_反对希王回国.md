　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Comprehensive report: Greece will hold a so-called "national referendum" on September 1st to decide on the issue of the Greek King's return. It is reported that this was decided by Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris after visiting Bevin last month. In order to achieve the expected result, the Tsaldaris government has carried out a series of provocative actions against Republican leftists and the National Liberation Front. The most prominent incident was the search of the Greek General Confederation of Labor and the arrest of four leaders of the trade union. The Greek government has recently ordered the dismissal, before September 1st, of all civil servants who participated in the December 1944 incident and supported the National Liberation Front.
