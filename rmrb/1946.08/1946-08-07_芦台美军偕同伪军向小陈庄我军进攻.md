Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 4th. Two days before the "Anping Incident" on July 29th, when US troops and Chiang's troops jointly provoked the military and civilians in the Jidong Liberated Area, US troops stationed in Lutai on the Beining Railway also unreasonably invaded the Jidong Liberated Area. At 8:00 AM on July 27th, more than ten US troops from Lutai Station, seventy miles north of Tanggu, along with more than thirty puppet troops from the area, carrying one mortar, two light machine guns, and one heavy machine gun, attacked a certain detachment of the Eighth Route Army in Xiaochen Village, northeast of Lutai Station, in four armored vehicles. They fired nine shells, wounding two soldiers of the Eighth Route Army and destroying one civilian house. In order to promote the awareness of the US troops, the detachment painfully retreated and urgently telegraphed its superiors, requesting that a warning be issued to the US military authorities. If similar incidents occur again, the Eighth Route Army will be forced to implement resolute self-defense to protect the safety of the people's lives and property.

　　芦台美军偕同伪军向小陈庄我军进攻
    【新华社遵化四日电】在七月二十九日美军与蒋军联合向冀东解放区军民挑衅发生“安平事件”之前两日，驻北宁路芦台美军亦直接向冀东解放区无理进犯。七月二十七日上午八时，塘沽北七十里芦台车站美军十余人，偕同该地伪军三十余名，携迫击炮一门、轻机枪两挺、重机枪一挺，乘装甲车四辆，向芦台车站东北方小陈庄之八路军某支队进攻。发炮九发，八路军两战士受伤，民房一间被毁。该支队为促美军觉悟，忍痛退避，并急电上级要求向美军当局提出警告，如再发生类此事件，八路军为保卫人民生命财产安全将被迫实行坚决自卫。
