Jiang's Tyranny is More Ferocious than Tigers and Wolves
    ——People in the Kuomintang Areas of Ji and Qi Groan on the Brink of Starvation
    Li Ziru
    "As soon as the sun shows its face, it's covered by clouds again. Damn it, it's still a dark world." This is a very apt judgment of the Kuomintang's rule by a citizen of Jixian County.

    After the Japanese surrender, the most distinct and painful feeling given to people by all the measures of the Kuomintang government can be expressed in two popular rhyming phrases: "Building bunkers, digging trenches, heavy labor; demanding grain and firewood, unclear burdens." The Kuomintang army's construction of fortifications has never stopped, especially since Du Xiyao (Kuomintang Magistrate of Jixian County) and Sun Dianying attended the "Security Conference" in Zhengzhou in May. The Kuomintang authorities have been conscripting labor and materials on a large scale, planning to build 277 large bunkers throughout Jixian County. City walls, street intersections, and important market towns are all woven into a dense network of bunkers. On transportation lines, three bunkers were added to each interval in the bunker lines left by the Japanese. The most interesting thing is the Wangjing Tower in Jixian City, a historical site left by Prince Lu of the Ming Dynasty, which is about twice as high as the city wall. However, the mixed Japanese-Jiang army (the New Fifth Army) forcibly assigned the task of building a bunker on it to the northeast township. According to ancient legends, many craftsmen died to build the Wangjing Tower. Unexpectedly, this story is being repeated today. How can the township head not be anxious? As a result, he sent 300,000 silver dollars to "smooth things over."

    During the wheat harvest season, which farmers call the "golden period," each bao (a unit of local administration) still had to send twenty or thirty people to work every day. Therefore, in these days, most villages were hiring people to work with one dou of wheat per day. The completion of each bunker is a crystallization of the people's blood, sweat, and tears. According to the people's calculations, the materials needed for a bunker, such as wood, stone, bricks, tiles, labor, and entertainment expenses, amount to about 200 shi of wheat. In order to ensure that their workers suffer less and do less unjust work, each bao regards entertainment as an indispensable means, and it is a considerable sum of money. Liangcun Village in Qixian County was ordered to dig a railway ditch for the 30th Army, one zhang and five chi deep (originally one zhang deep), and fifteen zhang long. After three days, because the deadline was exceeded, the thirty-two workers were kept there to work day and night and were not allowed to go back. Later, the bao head sent two baskets of eggs (six to seven hundred), three bottles of wine (nine jin), five jin of pork, a large basket of foreign cigarettes (ten large packs), and two large baskets of white flour and ten pairs of shoes before they were allowed to stop digging.

    The people are forced to perform this kind of hard labor. In their hearts, they have long understood what the Kuomintang army wants to do and foresee its future. The old people of Jixian County said: "In the past, the Japanese also asked them to build bunkers and dig trenches. When the bunkers were built and the trenches were dug, Japan also lost. Now the Central Army is doing the same!" Some people said: "Let them build it. They want to fight the Eighth Route Army, but they can't withstand the Eighth Route Army's artillery."

    The amount of burden on the people under the Kuomintang rule is even more appalling. The Kuomintang's exorbitant taxes and levies are levied everywhere and exist in every industry. A person selling zongzi in Jixian City paid more than 50,000 yuan in taxes in three months in the spring. The poorest citizens without houses or land had to pay at least three to four thousand yuan per month for the door tax (also called the pot bottom tax). After the wheat harvest this year, Zhang Guqing, the president of the Jixian Chamber of Commerce, convened a meeting of various businesses and announced that each business would be assessed 300,000 yuan. Even the smallest shop would be assessed two or three shares, and each payment would be tens of thousands to one million yuan. Most small and medium-sized businesses could not support it and closed down one after another. The stores that have closed down include Qingfenglong (owner Song Junqing), a sundry shop on the east side of Nanma Market Street, and a foreign goods store (owner Zhou Shanping) on the east side of the same street, a sundry shop (owner Mr. Zhang) behind the Yuandi Temple on the east side of Beima Market Street, and a sundry shop (owner Zhang Jinrong) behind the theater on Yanshou Palace Street. In addition, the news of continued business closures is heard every day.

    The burden on Yantun Bao in the northeast township of Jixian County (the bao is 20 miles away from the city, has five natural villages, and has 60 mu of land) in the six months from the first month of the lunar calendar to the present is as follows:

    Wheat 3.8 dou (calculated per mu, the same below), firewood 80 jin, grass 60 jin. The above 80 jin of firewood is equivalent to 5330 yuan in legal tender, and 60 jin of grass is equivalent to 4000 yuan in legal tender. Wheat is calculated at the market price of 2700 yuan per dou at the time, and firewood and grass are converted into 3.45 dou of wheat. Adding the 3.8 dou of wheat levied per mu, the actual burden per mu is 7.25 dou of wheat (including the 2 dou of wheat levied per mu after the wheat harvest this year), equivalent to 217.5 jin in the market scale (30 jin per dou). However, the highest yield per mu this wheat season was only 3 dou. However, after the masses paid such a large amount of burden, they still could not clear the Kuomintang's most recent levy. After the wheat harvest, the Kuomintang levied the following on the bao at one time:

    80,000 jin of wheat, 800,000 yuan for the commissioner's clothing expenses, 7 telegraph poles (2 dou of wheat per pole), 50 pairs of shoes (1 dou of wheat per pair), building a pillbox (equivalent to about 200 shi of wheat), and building a barrack room.

    The amount that the bao has already borne after the wheat harvest this year (2 dou of wheat per mu) can only pay for half of this levy. Most of the rest is used to repay old debts and miscellaneous entertainment expenses. Landlords, local bullies, and bao officials deposit money in the bao before the wheat harvest (most of the money comes from corruption), and convert it into wheat at a low price. Now they want to get it back with a double profit (one becomes two).

    However, under the Kuomintang's predatory policy of taking whatever they want, some people are embarking on the road to wealth, namely local bullies, bao ruffians, usurers, and those who work in Kuomintang military and political organs. They work diligently and make money on paper, trying to transfer the burden to the vast number of honest farmers, and they also seize huge profits from it. They add five sheng of wheat in other places (that is, five sheng of profit per dou), and put it in the bao to get a profit of two and a half times (that is, two and a half dou per dou). Bao officials get four dou of wheat per month as salary, but they do not donate money themselves, and deposit it in the bao to get two and a half times the wheat. The money they put in the bao is converted into one dou of wheat at 1,500 yuan (the market price at the time was 2,000 yuan per dou), and after the wheat harvest, they get two and a half times the wheat (the market price after the wheat harvest was 2,700 yuan per dou). Large usurers are mostly concentrated in Qixian County, such as Lianghang Dachang, F茂, Hongchang, Hongqingyuan, Zhonghexing (the money lending shop opened by Beiyang's rich man in the city, his accounts are mostly in the southeast township of Qixian County), as well as Wang Laohan, Sun Yanxiu (from Wangzhuang), etc. are all big nests of usurers. This year, in the rural areas of Qixian County, in addition to the plunder by the Kuomintang authorities, they also plundered a large part. During the wheat threshing season, 32 carts of usurers gathered in Huangdui Village one day to collect wheat debts.

    The fruits of the masses' hard work throughout the year are plundered away before they even see them, and they can hardly live. The farmers in Huangdui Liangxiang area eat oatmeal paste every day to fill their stomachs in this hot and busy summer season (when they should eat white flour and good food), and they have no money to buy even the vegetables and salt for seasoning. In order to avoid and reduce further burdens, they are selling their land to the government and public organizations. They have also created a strange example of selling land that has never been heard of before, that is, they hand over the land to government agencies, etc., and pay back three sheng of wheat or 200 yuan in legal tender per mu. Farmers in Liangxiang sold 12 qing of land in this situation (the land can yield 200 jin of grain per mu per year), which can reduce the Ding Yin (poll tax) by about 60 liang. Now the Qixian County Government, the National Corps, Xigang Middle School, Nanguan Primary School and other institutions are buying such land on a large scale. According to people from the National Corps, the organs and groups have now purchased about 20,000 mu of such land (equivalent to 1,000 taels of silver), and the most realistic thing is that 600 shi of wheat have already reached their pockets.

    On the other hand, local ruffians, hooligans, combined with marauding soldiers and defeated troops, constantly rise up to rob and disturb the people. A soldier of the New Fifth Army in Jixian County stalked a farmer (near Liyuan Town, Jixian County) who had 50,000 yuan with him, chasing him for more than ten miles, but failed to rob him due to bad luck. In the Huangdui Liangxiang area, the quilts and clothes taken off by farmers watching the wheat fields at night are often stolen by robbers when they fall asleep. A man surnamed Wang in Liangxiang lost two sets of clothes in this way. When robbers do such things, they cover the eyes of the victims with mud.

    In this world of hunger, poverty, corruption, exploitation, and banditry, people have developed a strong hatred for the Kuomintang rulers.

    "The Japanese are teachers, and the Central Army is their apprentices. Now the Central Army has surpassed the teachers."

    "The Japanese left behind bad seeds, and the Central Army came out, which is even more fierce than the Japanese." The old people in Huangdui area of Qixian County said.

    "Bastards! You have to squeeze the people dry even if they don't eat or drink." The women in Chengguan, Jixian County said.

    The poor citizens of Jixian County said: "Let the Eighth Route Army come over, we can only survive if the Eighth Route Army comes over!"

                                                          End

　　蒋家暴政赛虎狼
    ——汲、淇国民党区人民呻吟在饥饿线上
    李自如
    “太阳刚一露头，又被云彩遮住了。他妈个屄，还是黑暗世界”。这是汲县城的一个市民，对国民党的统治，下的很恰当的断语。
    日寇投降后，国民党政府的一切措施，给予人最明确最痛苦的感触，可以用老百姓说的两句谐语表达出来：“修碉堡，挖战沟，差事繁重；要粮款，和柴草，负担不清。”国民党军修筑工事，根本没有间歇过，特别是自五月间杜希尧（汲县国民党县长）及孙殿英到郑州开过“治安会议”以后，国民党当局征工征料，大兴土工，计划汲县全境修筑二百七十七个大碉堡，城垣周围，街衢要口，重要集镇，都被围织在稠密的碉堡网里。交通线上在日寇留下的碉堡线的每一个间隔里，又增添三个碉堡。最有趣的是汲县城里有个望京楼，这是明朝潞王遗留下来的古迹，比城墙高出约两倍，可是蒋日混合造的四路军（即新五军），却硬分派给东北乡在那上面修碉堡。在古人传说里，为了修建望京楼不知死了多少工匠，不意这个故事却又在今日重演，这怎能叫乡长不着急？结果送了三十万礼洋把这件事情“疏通”了。
    庄稼汉称为“黄金时期”的麦收季节，各保每天仍得派二三十人去做工，所以在这几天，大多数的乡村，是每天出一斗麦子雇人去做工的。每一个碉堡的完成，都是人民的血泪汗的结晶，据群众的计算，一个碉堡所需的木、石、砖、瓦、工等料及应酬送礼等费，约合二百石麦子，各保为了使自己的工人少受气，少做冤工，应酬送礼成了必不可少的手段，而且是数目相当大的一笔款子。淇县梁乡村给三十军挖铁路沟，叫挖一丈五尺深（原有一丈深），十五丈长，三天到头，因逾了期限未完工，三十二个工人，留在那里昼夜做工，不放回去，后来保长送去鸡蛋两篮（六七百），酒三瓶（九斤），猪肉五斤，洋烟一大篮（十大包），白面两大篮，鞋十双，才算不叫挖了。
    人民被迫服这种苦役，心里边早就明白了国民党军要干什么，并预示着他的前途，汲县的老百姓说：“从前日本人就是叫给他修碉堡，挖战沟，等到碉堡修好了，战沟挖齐了，日本也败了，现在中央军又是这样！”又有人说：“叫他修吧，他要打八路，可吃不住八路军的大炮一炮敲”。
    人民在国民党统治下的负担数目，更是惊人，国民党的苛捐杂税，是无处不征，无行不有。汲县城一个卖粽子的在春天三个月中即出捐五万多元；无房无地最贫苦的市民每月出门头捐（也叫锅底捐）至少也得三四千元。今年麦后，汲县商务会长张谷青召集各商号开会，宣布了商号每分派款三十万元，而商人最小的铺面起码也够上二三分，一次出款即须数十万至一百万，一般中小商号不能支持纷纷闭门歇业。已停业的有南马市街路东碎货铺庆丰隆（掌柜宋俊卿）及同街路东的一个洋货庄（掌柜周善平），北马市街元帝庙后路东的一个碎货铺（掌柜张某），延寿宫街戏楼后路东的一个碎货铺（掌柜张金熔）等，此外继续停业的正日有所闻。
    汲县东北乡阎屯保（该保距城二十里，共辖五个自然村，有土地六十顷）从旧历正月到现在的六个月中，负担数目如下：
    麦子三斗八升（以每亩计算，下同），木柴八十斤，草六十斤。以上木柴八十斤，合法币五三三○元，草六十斤，合法币四○○○元，麦子以当时市价每斗二七○○元计算，柴草共折麦子三斗四升五合，加上每亩派麦三斗八升，实际每亩共负担麦子七斗二升五合（内有今年麦后派的每亩二斗麦子），合市秤二一七斤半（每斗三十斤），而今年麦季最高的收成，每亩不过三斗。可是群众支付了如此数目的负担以后，并不能将国民党最近一次的征派偿清，麦后国民党对该保一次的征派就有：
    麦子八○○○○斤，专署服装费八○○○○○元，电线杆七根（每根二斗麦子），鞋五○双（每双一斗麦子），修建炮楼一个（约合二百石麦子），修建兵房一间。
    该保今年麦后已经负担的数目（每亩派麦二斗），只能偿付这次征派的半数，其余大部分都用于偿还旧欠，及杂化应酬上了，地主、土劣、及保办事人，麦前存到保中的款子（款子大都由贪污得来），以贱价折成麦子，现在要以二倍的利得回去（一个得两个）。
    但在国民党这种予取予求的掠夺政策下，有些人却走上发财大道，那就是土劣、保棍、高利贷主及在国民党军政机关作事的人，他们心眼里做事，笔头上生财，设法把负担转到广大的老实农民身上，自己又从中攫取大利，他们在别处加五揭麦（即一斗加五升的利），放到保中以二倍半得利（即一斗得二斗半），保办事人，每月薪麦四斗，自己捐款不出，存到保中，也以二倍半得麦，他们放到保中的款子，以一千五百元折一斗麦子（当时市价每斗二千元），麦后又以二倍半得麦子（麦后每斗市价二千七百元），大的高利贷主多集中在淇县城，如粮行大昌、福茂、宏昌、宏庆源，中和祥（北杨财主在城内开的放账铺，他的账大都在淇县东南乡）以及王老汉，孙延秀（王庄人）等都是高利贷的大窝主，今年淇县农村的麦子，除国民党当局掠夺外，他们也掠夺一大部分，打麦场时，黄堆村一天曾聚集高利贷主们三十二辆大车讨麦债。
    群众一年辛苦得来的果实，不见影即被人家掠夺了去，他们很难生活下去了。黄堆梁乡一带的农民，在这酷热和农忙的大暑天（照例应当吃白面好饭的季节），每天喝大麦面糊糊来充饥，连就饭的菜，调味的盐，也无钱购买，他们为着避免和减轻再负担，把地纷纷出卖给政府和公共团体。他们卖地的方法，也开了亘古未闻的奇例，即把地交给政府等机关，每亩倒贴三升麦子或二百元法币。梁乡农民就在这样的情况下卖掉土地十二顷（该地每亩每年能收粮二百斤），约可卸下丁银六十两，现在淇县县政府，国民兵团，西岗中学，南关小学等机关，正大肆收买此种土地，出卖者有贫农、中农、地主等，以中农为最多。地区上以淇县南部为最多，淇东、东南、东北各乡也有一部分，据国民兵团的人谈称，各机关团体现已收买此种土地约二万亩（合一千两银），这些官僚阔绅，不费吹毛之力，即夺得如此巨数的土地，而且最现实的是已经有六百石麦子到了他们的荷包里。
    另一方面，地痞、流氓，结合着乱兵残勇，不断起来打路打劫，搅扰人民，汲县新五军的一个士兵，曾对一个带有五万元的农民（汲县李源镇附近的）盯梢，一直追了十几里，因机遇不好，打劫未成。黄堆梁乡一带，夜间看麦场的农民，当他们睡熟以后，身上盖的被子及脱下的衣服，常被劫徒们偷走，梁乡一个姓王的就这样连丢了两身衣服。劫徒们行这种事情时，用污泥污住被劫者的眼睛。
    在这个饥饿贫困，贪污剥削，盗匪抢劫，交织起来的世界里，人们对国民党统治者发生了强烈的憎恶。
    “日本人是老师，中央军是徒弟，现在中央军已经淤师了。”
    “日本人丢下了坏种子，出了个中央军，比日本还厉害”。淇县黄堆一带的老百姓说。
    “王八孙！老百姓，不吃不喝也得给恁弄。”汲县城关的妇女们说。
    汲县的贫苦市民说：“八路军过来吧，八路军过来才能活下去！”
                                                          完
