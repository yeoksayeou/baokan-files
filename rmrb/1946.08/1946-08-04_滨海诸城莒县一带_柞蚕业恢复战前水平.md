Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 31st - The famous tussah silk industry in Zhucheng, Ju County, and Rizhao areas of the coastal liberated zone has rapidly recovered to pre-war levels with the support of the democratic government. Before the War of Resistance, the area produced 160,000 "kuai" (each kuai weighing 40 taels) of silk annually, worth approximately 4 million taels of silver. After the area fell under enemy occupation, silk cocoons could not be exported, Northeast cocoon seeds could not be purchased, and silk producers faced extremely heavy burdens. By the spring of 1933, the silk industry had come to a complete standstill. In the autumn of 1943, after the Eighth Route Army liberated the area, annual silk production jumped to over 10,000 "kuai" that same year. In the spring of 1945, the government provided loans and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce took responsibility for resolving difficulties for silkworm farmers and purchasing cocoons and silk. That year, silk production surged again to over 36,000 "kuai". This spring, a Sericulture Guidance Center was established, setting up breeding farms and reeling and weaving factories, along with a group of technicians, extension workers, and trainees. The breeding farms specialize in providing silkworm farmers with high-quality silkworm eggs and researching silkworm rearing methods and preventing diseases. The reeling and weaving factories are improving reeling and weaving methods, increasing silk production quality, and researching the weaving of serge and twill. Extension workers provide demonstrations and guidance, organize production and sales cooperatives, and oversee loan matters. This spring, the center has already issued 500,000 yuan in loans. If the oak leaves are not damaged by pests this autumn, it is possible that 160,000 "kuai" of silk will be produced. With each "kuai" valued at 700 yuan, it is estimated that income may exceed 100 million yuan. Currently, the silk reeling factory is busy increasing its machinery to welcome the arrival of autumn cocoons.

　　滨海诸城莒县一带
    柞蚕业恢复战前水平
    【新华社临沂三十一日电】滨海解放区诸城、莒县、日照一带著名的榨蚕丝业，在民主政府扶助下已迅速恢复战前水平。该区在抗战前年产丝十六万块（每块四十两），价值约四百余万两银子。自沦陷以后，丝茧不能出口，东北茧种无法购运，丝户负担奇重。二十二年春，丝业即完全陷入停顿状态。三十二年秋，八路军解放该区后，当年产丝量即一跃上升至一万余块。三十四年春政府予以贷款，并由工商管理局负责替蚕民解决困难，收买茧丝，是年丝产量复激增至三万六千余块。今春复成立蚕业指导所，设置育种场与缫织场，及一批技术员推广员与练习生。育种场专供蚕民以优良蚕种，并研究育蚕法及预防病害等事宜。缫织场则改良缫织方法，提高丝产质量，研究织哔叽与斜纹呢。推广员作示范指导，组织产销合作社，主持贷款事宜。该所今春已发放贷款五十万元，今秋如红叶不遭虫害，即可能产丝十六万块，每块以七百元计算，预计可收入一万万余元。现缫丝场正忙着增加机件，迎接秋茧上市。
