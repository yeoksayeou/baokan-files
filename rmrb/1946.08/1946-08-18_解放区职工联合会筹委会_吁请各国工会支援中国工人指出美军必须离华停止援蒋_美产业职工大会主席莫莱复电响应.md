　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 15th: Liu Ningyi, alternate council member of the World Federation of Trade Unions and director of the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Area Federation of Trade Unions of China, telegraphed Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, on the 3rd of this month, and forwarded it to the trade unions and workers of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Romania, Czechoslovakia, India, South America, Yugoslavia, and countries around the world, calling on the World Federation of Trade Unions to "promptly draw the attention of trade unions of all countries and take effective steps to assist Chinese workers so as to promote peace in China as soon as possible." After describing the current severe civil war and economic crisis in China, the telegram pointed out: "The stationing of U.S. troops in China and the military assistance to the Kuomintang government are direct factors for the further expansion of the Chinese civil war and the aggravation of the economic crisis. Not only is China's peace being unprecedentedly undermined, but world peace is also being seriously threatened." It solemnly stated that "the U.S. government's erroneous policy of assisting China must be changed in order for the World Federation of Trade Unions' resolution to ensure human peace to be realized."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 15th: Liu Ningyi, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Area Federation of Trade Unions, telegraphed Murray, President of the U.S. Congress of Industrial Organizations, calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China. A reply has now been received as follows: "Your telegram has been received. The U.S. Congress of Industrial Organizations opposes any illegal use of American troops. In view of the development of the situation in China, we are negotiating with our government. Murray, President of the U.S. Congress of Industrial Organizations, July 31st."

    吁请各国工会支援中国工人指出美军必须离华停止援蒋
    美产业职工大会主席莫莱复电响应
    【新华社延安十五日电】世界职工会联合会候补理事、中国解放区职工联合会筹备会主任刘宁一氏，于本月三日致电世界工联会秘书长赛扬，并转英、法、苏、罗、捷、印、南美、南斯拉夫及世界各国工会及工友、呼吁世界工联“迅速提起世界各国工会注意，采取有效步骤，援助中国工人，以促使中国能早日和平”。该电在叙述目前中国严重的内战与经济危机后，指出：“美国政府在华驻军与对国民党政府的军事援助，实为中国内战更加扩大、经济危机更加严重的直接因索。不仅中国和平遭到空前破坏，世界和平也受到严重威胁。”并严重表示“美国政府错误的援华政策必须改变，世界工联确保人类和平的决议方能实现”。
    【新华社延安十五日电】解放区职工联合会筹备会主任刘宁一氏，曾致电美国产业职工大会会长莫莱，呼吁撤退在华美军，顷已接到复电如下：“来电收到，美国产业职工大会反对任何非法使用美国军队之举，鉴于中国局势之发展，我们正和我们的政府交涉。美国产业职工大会主席莫莱，七月三十一日”。
