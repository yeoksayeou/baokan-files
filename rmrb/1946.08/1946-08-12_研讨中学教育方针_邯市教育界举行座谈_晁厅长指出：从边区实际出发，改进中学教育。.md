Discussing Middle School Education Policy
Handan Education Circles Hold Symposium
Director Chao Points Out: Improve Middle School Education Based on the Actual Situation of the Border Region.

[Handan, 4th dispatch] Yesterday, the Handan education circle held an education symposium at the People's Education Center to discuss the middle school education policy and reform plan. More than 20 representatives from the Border Region Government Education Department, Handan Education Section, Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, Handan Middle School, People's Education Center and other units attended. Directors Chao and Cui from the Education Department both participated. At the meeting, Principal Zhang of Handan Middle School reported on the school's development process, the ideological trends of students, and preliminary opinions on the school's vocationalization.

In the afternoon, Director Chao expressed his opinions. He first described the development of education in our border region, saying: Primary schools are the closest to the masses, and the masses have risen up to transform schools after their liberation. The number of schools and students has increased sharply, and the results are the best. Higher primary schools are farther away from the masses, and the transformation is worse. Middle schools are the farthest away from the masses, and most of them still retain the old set of college-oriented education that is divorced from practical needs. Since the "middle school education cultivates cadres" policy was promulgated, those who transformed according to this policy have also created a "dual task" approach, that is, training older and less intelligent students to become cadres, while still allowing younger and more intelligent students to go to college. Today, the transformation of middle schools should be aimed at the practical needs of our border region's backward rural areas and underdeveloped industries, cultivating "production cadres" and "small and medium-sized entrepreneurs" for production and construction, that is, small and medium-sized cadres with "a specific skill," so that each student must possess: "production technology; production knowledge; and the spirit of serving the masses." He said: "In order to achieve this quickly and thoroughly, we must clear our minds and attach farms and factories to schools so that teachers and students have the opportunity to practice. At the same time, we can also engage in production for profit to supplement the school's insufficient funding and solve the difficulties of teachers and students."

In order to enable everyone to further study this new policy and its implementation methods, it is specifically stipulated that discussions and work inspections should be carried out in groups by school. In addition to using this report as the center for discussing documents, the "Base Area Education Reform Plan," "On the Construction of Chinese Normal Education," "Middle School Education Policy of Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region," and "Provisional Program for Secondary School Education in Taihang" are designated as required reference documents. Finally, it was decided to hold a general symposium on the tenth of this month. (Qi Zhi)

　　研讨中学教育方针            
    邯市教育界举行座谈            
    晁厅长指出：从边区实际出发，改进中学教育。
    【邯郸四日讯】本市教育界昨日假民教馆举行教育座谈会，研讨中学教育方针及改革方案。到边府教育厅、邯市教育科、市委宣传部、邯中、民众教育馆等单位代表二十余人。教育厅晁、崔两厅长均参加，会上邯中张校长曾报告该校发展过程，学生思想动态及对该校走上职业化之初步意见。
    下午由晁厅长发表意见。渠首述我边区教育发展情况谓：初小最接近群众，群众翻身后已起而改造学校，学校与学生骤增，成绩最好；高小离群众较远，改造较差；而中学离群众最远，大部尚保留着旧一套的脱离现实需要之升学教育。自“中学教育培养干部”的方针颁布后，依此改造者又产生了“双重任务”的办法，即将年长愚笨者培养为干部，而年少聪慧者仍令升学。今天改造中学应针对我边区农村落后，工业不发达的现实需要，培养生产建设之“生产干部”与“中小事业家”即具有“一技之长”的中小干部，使每一学员必须具备：“生产技术；生产知识，与为群众服务之事业精神”。他说：“为迅速彻底的作到这一点，要打通思想，要在学校中附设农场及工厂使师生均有实习之机会。同时并可以生产营利补学校经费之不足，解决师生困难。”
    为使大家进一步研究此新方针及其实施办法，特规定以校为单位，分组研讨，检查工作。除以此报告为中心研讨文件外，并指定“根据地教育改革方案”、“中国师范教育建设论”、“晋冀察中学教育方针”、“太行中等学校教育暂行方案”等为必读之参考文件。最后商定于本月十日举行大会座谈。  （奇之）
