The People of Lanfeng City
    Accuse Jiang's Army of War Crimes
    Jiang's Army Regiment Commander Xu Zhiqing Speaks Emotionally About the Pain of Civil War
    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 16th Dispatch] After our army liberated Lanfeng along the Longhai Railway, the people in the city cried out to our army about the great disasters brought to them by Jiang's army fighting the civil war, unanimously requesting our army to continue to advance and liberate the entire line. The public servants of the Yellow River Commission's Hebei Repair and Defense Office stationed in the city jointly accused Jiang's army of being rude and unreasonable, forcibly occupying the Yellow River Commission's residence as a battlefield, and imprisoning the survey team and technician Zhang Senrong and more than 20 others, fearing that they would "collude with the bandits" and leak information. They said, "We only gained freedom after you came." One of the staff members was wounded by Jiang's army, and our medical team immediately treated him. All the staff of the Yellow River Commission expressed their heartfelt gratitude to our army for protecting their safety. Zhang Yingjun, the warehouse director of the Executive Yuan's Henan Branch, and more than 20 others also expressed their gratitude to our army for protecting their safety.
    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 17th Dispatch] On the 14th, this reporter visited Xu Zhiqing, the regimental commander of the 220th Regiment of the 74th Brigade of the 55th Division of the 38th Army of the former Northwest Army, and five other officers, who were among the first to lay down their weapons in Lanfeng and arrive at the reception center of the Political Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region. Regiment Commander Xu said painfully, "For eight years of the War of Resistance, we always fought against the enemy on the front line. After the victory, we hoped for the emergence of a new China that was independent, peaceful, and democratic. As a result, we were deceived by Chiang Kai-shek to come north to conduct a traitorous and anti-communist civil war, violating our own conscience and fighting our own compatriots, so we laid down our weapons as soon as the battle started." He continued that while stationed in Lanfeng City, he witnessed the people's complaints everywhere, even believing that it was not as good as the days of Japanese rule. Everywhere in the streets and alleys were cries of unwillingness to fight the civil war. In this situation, the morale of the troops was extremely depressed. Finally, Regiment Commander Xu said, "Laying down our weapons is something we had expected long ago, and it is also our only way out. From now on, we will break away from the bitter sea of civil war, start anew with the people, and I am sincerely relieved."

　　兰封城内人民
    控诉蒋军内战罪行
    蒋军许支庆团长慨谈内战痛苦
    【本报荷泽十六日电】陇海沿线我军解放兰封后，城内人民纷向我军哭诉蒋军打内战带给人民的巨大灾难，一致要求我军继续前进解放全线。驻于该城之黄委会河北修防处公务人员，向我军联名控诉蒋军横蛮无理，强迫占领黄委会驻地，作为战场，把测量队及技师张森荣等二十余人，囚禁起来，怕他们“通匪”走漏消息。他们说：“你们来了，我们才有了自由”。其中有一位职员被蒋军击伤，我卫生队立即予以医治，黄委会全体人员对我军保护了他们的安全，表示衷心的感谢。又行总河南分署仓库主任张英俊等二十余人，亦以我军保护他们安全表示谢意。
    【本报荷泽十七日电】十四日，记者走访在兰封放下武器首批到达冀鲁豫军区政治部招待所之原西北军三十八军五十五师七十四旅二百二十团团长许支庆等五位军官，许团长沉痛地说：“抗战八年，始终在第一线与敌作战，胜利之后盼有一独立、和平、民主之新中国出现，结果被蒋介石欺骗北来，进行卖国反共内战，违背自己良心，打自己同胞，故一经战斗即行放下武器”。继谈渠驻兰封城内，目睹人民怨声载道，甚至以为不如往日日寇统治时期，街头巷尾到处是不愿打内战的呼声，在此情况下，部队士气沮丧到达极点。末后，许团长说：“放下武器，是我们早已预料的事，也是我们唯一生路，从此脱离内战苦海，与民更始，个人衷心欣慰无已。”
