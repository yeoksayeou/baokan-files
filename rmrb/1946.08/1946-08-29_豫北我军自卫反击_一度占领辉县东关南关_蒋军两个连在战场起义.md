　　Our Army in Northern Henan Launches Self-Defense Counterattack
    Once Occupying the East and South Gates of Hui County
    Two Companies of Chiang's Army Uprising on the Battlefield
    [This dispatch from Changzhi, 25th] The Chiang Kai-shek's troops launched a large-scale offensive against our Northern Henan, and our army was forced to defend itself. Following the recovery of Yancun, east of Hui County, on the evening of the 11th, a self-defense counterattack was launched on the evening of the 20th. After fierce fighting, the Chiang Kai-shek troops and puppet army's more than ten strongholds around Hui County, including Gaozhuang Town, Changcun, Yangzhuang, Guzhang, Beichenmai, Huangtu, and East and West Gengcun, were completely wiped out that night. On the 21st, they forced their way into the suburbs of the city. On the 22nd, a part of our army captured Xinzhuang, a stronghold of the puppet army southwest of Hui County, annihilating more than 100 puppet soldiers. Taking advantage of the victory, they occupied the East Gate and South Gate. In the battle on the East Gate, two companies and two additional squads of the 177th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek's 38th Division, deeply moved by our battlefield appeals and understanding of righteousness, were unwilling to be used by Chiang Kai-shek as tools for the civil war and make unnecessary sacrifices. They launched an anti-civil war uprising on the front line and entered our army's position. After our army annihilated the die-hard remnants of Chiang's army, it moved into the East Gate. On the 23rd, Chiang's army in Xinxiang came to reinforce with air and ground coordination. Our army has now moved to a stand-off in the suburbs of the city.
    [This dispatch from Jiaozuo, 23rd] Our correspondent at the front learned that before Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale offensive against the Northern Henan liberated area, Bai Chongxi was specially dispatched to Xinxiang three times to carry out civil war deployments. At a meeting of Kuomintang army officers above the battalion level, Bai Chongxi arrogantly incited his subordinates, saying, "Chairman Chiang has made the greatest determination to eliminate the CCP by force, and we have no room for compromise with the CCP." He also said, "Our army has excellent American weapons, and we are much better equipped than we were in the early days of the War of Resistance, while the CCP's current weapons are not as good as those used by our army in the early days of the War of Resistance." The Chiang Kai-shek's war faction only knows that war is determined by American weapons, but does not know that war is more importantly determined by the soldiers who hold the weapons and the people who support the soldiers. Therefore, Bai Chongxi's mobilization is only a kind of anesthetic for the war faction to its subordinates.

　　豫北我军自卫反击
    一度占领辉县东关南关
    蒋军两个连在战场起义
    【本报长治二十五日电】蒋伪军大举向我豫北进攻，我军被迫自卫，继十一日晚恢复辉县城东之沿村后，二十日晚举行自卫反击，经激战后，当夜即将辉县城四周之高庄镇、常村、杨庄、古章、北陈麦、黄土、东西耿村等蒋伪十余据点完全扫除，二十一日迫进城郊，二十二日我军一部攻克辉县城西南之伪军据点新庄，歼伪军百余，当即乘胜占领东关与南关。在东关方面的战斗中，蒋军三八师一七七旅两个连及另外两个班，经我战场喊话，晓以大义，深受感动，不愿为蒋介石充作内战工具，作无谓之牺牲，乃于火线上举行反内战起义，开入我军阵地，我军于歼灭顽抗之蒋军残部后，进驻东关。二十三日新乡蒋军以陆空配合来援，现我军转入城郊对峙。
    【本报焦作二十三日电】本社前线记者获悉：此次蒋介石大举进攻豫北解放区前，曾专派白崇禧三赴新乡，进行内战部署，动员在一次国民党军营级以上干部会议上，白崇禧曾狂妄的煽动其部下说：“蒋主席已下最大决心，要以武力消灭中共，我们与中共决无妥协的余地”。又说：“我军有优良的美国武器，我们已比抗战初期的武器好得多，而中共现在的武器，还不如抗战初期我军所使用者。”蒋介石好战集团，只知战争决定于美式武器，而不知战争更重要的决定于拿武器的士兵和供养士兵的人民，因此白崇禧此种动员，只是好战集团对其部下的一种麻醉剂而已。
