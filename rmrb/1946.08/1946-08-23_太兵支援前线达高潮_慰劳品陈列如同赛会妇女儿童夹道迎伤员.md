[This dispatch from our newspaper in Yangcheng] As the Chiang-Yan troops launch a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas along the Tongpu Railway, the people of the entire Taiyue region are organizing a strong logistical effort with unparalleled enthusiasm to support the front lines and strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war. More than 30,000 people and a large number of militiamen from Anze, Wenxi, Xiaxian, Pinglu, Xinjiang, Quwo, Jiangxian, Yicheng, Qinshui, Yuanqu, Yangcheng and other places bravely rushed to the front lines to participate in the war, transporting wounded soldiers, ammunition, and spoils of war. They rescued the wounded amidst gunfire and delivered food to them. Children and women from Beiguo and Xiguo in Wenxi, as well as male and female students from Jinnan Middle School, enthusiastically cared for the wounded day and night in field hospitals. From Xiguo, Beiguo, Weicun, Hedi, Hougong, all the way to Hengshui, comfort items such as watermelons, fresh fruits, meats, vegetables, eggs, fried dough twists, Rendan pills, towels, and soap were displayed as if it were a fair. In the hot sun, women and children waited by the roadside. As soon as stretchers arrived, they rushed to pour tea and water for the wounded, feed them food, and change their blood-stained clothes. In Wenxi County alone, comfort items included more than 200 fat pigs, more than 2,000 catties of watermelons and sweet melons, and more than 2,000 catties of dry cakes. Wang Qinxue, a blind man, and Yang Donghuang, a cripple, from Nanbu Village in the Third District of Yuanqu, helped each other make 60 stone mines. The masses in Zhangcun Village, Second District of Qinshui, competed to transport grain for the army to the front, with a total of 97 people and 22 donkeys participating. Li Songlin, who is 60 years old, drove a donkey carrying more than 100 catties and carried more than 20 catties himself. After they left, the women and children at home carried coal, fetched water, and hoed corn. Ma Li Tao, a woman, proposed, "If men can carry 80 catties of grain to the front, women can hoe one mu of corn in the rear." Gao Fengying and Wang Yue'e from Beishan Village, First District of Qinshui, not only participated in mutual aid teams to hoe the seedlings twice, but also braved the rain to carry more than 100 pieces of stone to make stone mines in preparation for war. In order to support the front line, Ergao of Yicheng is working hard to help more than 20 military families and families of transport teams in Beigan, hoeing a total of 94 and a half mu of millet, corn, and beans. On August 4th, Yangcheng Liugao organized 95 students into six groups to help military families and families of war support teams in villages such as Hujia and Yanshan with production tasks such as hoeing seedlings, weeding, and topping cotton plants.
