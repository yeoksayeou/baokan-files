　　The "Persuasion Movement" in Tonghui Village
　　Mu Yue, Zhan Chao

　　I. Active Elements Propose a "Persuasion Movement"

　　In late June, Wu Yun, a leading cadre from Wu'an County, went to the countryside to inspect the mass movement. Comrade Wu arrived at Tonghui Village in the Third District. This village was one of the most advanced villages in the entire county. The village cadres told Comrade Wu, "The masses in our village have basically turned themselves over!" They also cited many examples of wasteland in the village that no one wanted, proving that the emancipation movement was going well. While listening to the cadres' opinions, Comrade Wu began to conduct a detailed investigation. The results showed that out of the 310 peasant households in the village, 39 still had no land, and more than 50 peasant households had only one or two mu of bad land per person, which was not enough to maintain their livelihoods. One-third of the peasants had not been truly mobilized, and organized peasants accounted for only 40% of the total. Comrade Wu used these concrete facts to get the cadres and activists to see the situation clearly. Everyone said, "No wonder the masses are dissatisfied with us. We thought that the masses had turned themselves over just because we had. That's not right!" They also examined the past and found that it was wrong to say that all those who did not want land were the lonely and widowed. In fact, as long as the backward masses were helped to understand, some of the lonely and widowed would still be willing to take land. During this period, it was also discovered that landlords Yang Binggong, Yang Silou, Yang Qilou, etc., had strangled the wife of Yang Shunyi, who was settling accounts, and thrown her into a well. This greatly shocked all the cadres and activists, who realized that only when everyone had turned themselves over could it be considered a true emancipation. They were determined to bring all the masses along and launched a "persuasion movement" targeting the backward elements.

　　II. Running into Walls

　　At the beginning, the tenth street leader and group leader raised difficulties, saying that there were particularly many backward elements in his street, and they were all old men and women who could not be persuaded. They themselves also still had "nice guy" ideas and were unwilling to offend people. Everyone first helped them to understand the situation, and then went separately to mobilize and persuade the backward masses.

　　Old man Liu Longshan said, "Alas! 'A small man's fate is determined by the Heavenly Official, no matter how hard you try, it's useless!' (meaning: even if you move, it won't work). When I was helpless for the first two years, I wasn't sick. Later, after I had just made a few business trips, I was sick for half a year, and even lost all my capital!" The cadres and activists gave him an example, saying that Du Heting's wife was dying of sweating sickness, and Heting settled accounts and got back two strings of courtyards and twenty-four mu of land, and his wife's illness was also cured. But Liu Longshan shook his head and said, "Alas, it's just that people were not supposed to die! ... I'm not a three-year-old child, why do I need you to tell me to turn myself over!" The village chief went to persuade the old man Yang Wenqing, who sold malt sugar. The old man said, "Baoshan, I know that you are doing this for me to have land to cultivate, a house to live in, and to live a good life. But, you see, what you said is all in vain. I have been a good person all my life, and I am not going to offend people at the end of my life! It's okay for you to tell me this, but don't tell it to others. People will say: 'The village cadres are just causing trouble,' that wouldn't be good!" ...

　　The cadres and activists did not lose heart when they encountered this situation. They came up with a way to break through a few typical cases first.

　　III. Old Granny Yang Complains

　　In the past, there were more than 500 households in Tonghui Village, and the Yang family accounted for more than 300 of them. Among them, Yang Qide's wife was the oldest. She complained at the meeting of backward elements in the eighth and ninth street base points, saying, "The Yang family is the oldest, and I have suffered the most oppression! I am a lonely old woman, with no land to cultivate, no firewood to burn. I went to the Yang family ancestral hall to take two pieces of firewood to burn, and Yang Xichang and Yang Yuchang drove me out like pigs and dogs, and even scolded me! An old woman in her seventies or eighties was still sent to Boyan to build a factory for the Japanese! ... This is what my good grandsons did!" "In the past, I always felt that they were all young people, so let it be! Who would pay attention to you! Today I thought about it, and I can't not settle the accounts." These words struck the hearts of a group of old men and women. Yang Wenqing, the old man who sold malt sugar, said, "Seventh Granny is right. A rich man's grandson becomes a grandpa, and a poor man's grandpa becomes a grandson!" Seventh Granny continued, "At first, when I saw the traitors Yang Xichang (nicknamed 'Living Yama') and Song Yumin (nicknamed 'Big White Face') being shot, I felt a little pitiful. Now I think they should have been shot long ago. Keeping them sitting at home, eating and drinking well, all day long planning to be mean to us helpless households?! If the Eighth Route Army hadn't come, and Yang Xichang and his gang were still in charge, the poor people in Tonghui Street would have died almost all! This time, I must settle accounts and turn myself over thoroughly!" Everyone listened and praised: Seventh Granny is right.

　　Yang Wenxi, the old man who never opened his mouth, poured out the suffering of being oppressed by the Yang family landlords in a thorough and satisfying manner, and said, "We are still afraid of offending people? The rich man cursed the farmers' association and cursed us along with it! Their boundaries are clearly defined, and we must also draw them clearly. When two countries are at war, the Yellow River is the boundary! We didn't provoke him, but he provoked us first!" He also said, "I've figured it out, it's useless to be afraid of 'the sky changing' and not settling accounts. Chiang Kai-shek still cares whether you settle accounts or not. If you don't settle accounts, he will still kill you." Militia member Zhang Shuanghuo, seeing that the old people were more understanding than himself, stood up anxiously and embarrassedly, and after examining his own backward thinking caused by "sentimentality," he said, "I'm not afraid of being fanned by a fan even if I break my head! I'm not afraid of being drowned in a flood when crossing the river! This time, I can't give them one less account." At this time, twenty or thirty people all shouted. Later, when talking about active and backward elements, some people were envious and unfair: "The more Yue Wuchang turns himself over, the better he lives and the more he is praised. The more we don't want to turn ourselves over, the poorer we get, and we also end up as 'backward elements'. We'll turn ourselves over this time and show them." After hearing what militia member Zhang Shuanghuo said, an old man still hesitated a little, but old Liu Longshan said, "Have the village cadres been saying all along that we can't listen to anything? In fact, settling accounts is not for ourselves!" The old man nodded and said, "That's right. Our brains are not as firm as young people's, let's wait and see!" The village chief said, "You just wait and see. Whenever you feel that you should make suggestions or settle accounts, just do it, don't miss the opportunity."

　　IV. Backward Elements Take the Lead

　　The next day (July 26), a meeting was held to struggle against the thirteen major households, and everyone was very energetic. The hegemonic landlords such as "Southwest King" Yang Shaoxian were so frightened that they trembled. Many of the people who said "let's wait and see" the night before spoke up, and even took the lead. Even Yang Heshang, who had gone crazy with grief over the death of his son, was back in action. "Wait, I want to settle accounts with the Qilou family!" He said, jumping onto the table and waving his arms, "I started working as a hired hand when I was thirteen, and I'm sixty-four this year, and I still don't have a clod of land or a room! The suffering I've suffered from the landlord Yang Qilou's family alone is endless. I have to grind grain, carry water, and carry coal for them even when I'm farming for them. That new courtyard of the landlord's family was also built by me for free. I've suffered for most of my life, what am I waiting for if I don't turn myself over now?" Old Yang Longxi gesticulated and said, "I couldn't open my mind with a stone before, but now it's like a lock with a key, and it opens with a click!" ... According to statistics after the meeting, more than 30 of the 80-plus complainants were past backward elements.

　　V. "Who Doesn't Have a Problem!"

　　After holding big meetings and small meetings, and settling big accounts and small accounts, even on the day before the end of the accounting, near the end of the meeting, tenant Du Fulai raised a question. Everyone asked him why he hadn't raised his opinion earlier, and he said that it had never been his turn to speak. It was extremely difficult for him to raise this opinion. He thought about it again and again, not knowing how to say it appropriately? He also didn't know whether to settle accounts with the landlords who were not at home? Several times he almost figured it out, but the meeting was over! Today, seeing that the accounting was coming to an end, he mustered up the courage to raise it, and the cadres immediately encouraged him, and Du Fulai brought up all his opinions about the four landlords. Even when it came to distributing the fruits of the struggle, some people still raised the issue of settling accounts. For example, Xue Laoju's wife didn't participate in the accounting at night, and only arrived when the fruits of the landlord Yang Laokui were being distributed. After being persuaded by the cadres and the masses, she also got some things. Gao Fugui, who was the most backward in the past, also wanted to settle accounts. Others asked him, "Didn't you say you didn't have a problem?" He said, "Who doesn't have a problem in the old society!" The cadres said, "Raise it if you have a problem," and the masses said, "Raise it." In this way, the place where the fruits were distributed often naturally turned into a temporary complaining meeting, and many old men and women spoke freely in this kind of occasion.

　　VI. The Vagrant Wants Land

　　In order to achieve "the tiller has his own land," the fruits of this struggle were first distributed to the masses in the form of land and houses. On August 4, after the "Turnover and Account Settlement Committee" of the village checked the results, it was found that except for a few elderly people who had no labor force and wanted to find other ways, there was still one household without land, not because it had not been allocated, but because he did not want it. This man was called Hu Fuke, and he was very poor, but he didn't want land. Because he used to be a vagrant son, and he had squandered his family property by gambling! Later, he made a living by carrying water and begging for food. He drank a few cups of wine when he had some money, and went to beg for food when he woke up and had nothing to eat. Moreover, he also knew that "the Eighth Route Army won't let anyone starve to death," so he was very satisfied with his current life. After studying the reasons why Hu Fuke didn't want land, at the end of the accounting, he was invited to the meeting place, and everyone helped him to understand the situation and persuaded him: "You can't just rely on others for food in the future, you have to produce and get rich and live a good life." He admitted on the spot that he wanted five mu of land, but he didn't want it again after he went down. When the meeting was held at night to clear the accounts, Hu Fuke came again. He said, "It's not a solution to just rely on others for food." He also understood, but he had never cultivated land before. The cadres and activists knew that he was afraid that he would be caught as a lazy man if he couldn't cultivate it later, so they reduced it by two mu, leaving him with three mu of land, which he wanted. Everyone said, "Even Hu Fuke knows to want land, this time our Tonghui Street has turned over well."

　　VII. Everyone is Happy

　　The past backward elements were all involved in the complaining and accounting movement this time. Even four or five old people who could not move compared the past with the present. Yang Chenshi's wife, who was eighty-four years old, said, "I know it in my heart! The bailiffs in the past only knew how to collect grain and money, but our Eighth Route Army's bailiffs only know how to let everyone live a good life. When we old people can't move, they carry rice and flour to our house. ... I am really satisfied with this time, and I will say a good word to the King of Hell when I die." Yang Jinzhou's wife, who was the same age as her, couldn't get up when she sat down. When fighting against the thirteen major households, she had to be helped to listen to the meeting. Yang Chongcai, the oldest old man in the village, had to personally receive the fruits of the struggle. When he was walking back, his toothless mouth laughed and said, "I'm eighty-six this year, and I've been oppressed by others, I don't know if there is today." He waved the package in his hand and said, "Is this our thing? This time we got it back." Others asked him why he was still carrying a broom, she said, "Sweep it all away! Sweep away all the injustices of the past," which made everyone laugh.

　　同会村的“劝说运动”
    慕岳　展潮
    一、积极分子提出“劝说运动”
    六月下旬，武安县领导干部下乡检查群众运动，吴云同志到了三区同会村。这村是全县几个先进村之一，村干部们向吴同志说：“俺村群众翻身都翻得差不多了！”还举了全村很多荒地没人要的例子，证明翻身运动搞得不错。吴同志一面听取干部意见，一面着手进行细密的调查研究，结果发现全村三百一十户农民里面，还有三十九户没有地，五十多户农民每人只有一二亩坏地，不够维持生活；三分之一的农民还没有真正发动起来，有组织的农民只占全体百分之四十。吴同志以这些具体事实打通了干部积极分子的思想。都说：“怨不得群众不满意咱，咱自己翻了身就以为群众也翻了身，这可不对！”并检讨出过去说不要地的全是孤寡户是不对的，其实只要帮助落后群众打通思想，有些孤寡也还是愿意要地。在这时期又发现了地主杨炳功、杨四楼、杨七楼等，把算账群众杨顺义老婆勒死投井的事，更大大地震动了全体干部和积极分子，认识到只有大伙都翻了身，才算是真翻身。决心把全体群众都带起来。便开展了一个对落后分子的“劝说运动”。
    二、碰钉子
    一开头十街街长、组长就提出困难，说他街的落后分子特别多，而且都是些老汉和娘们，怎也说不动。他们自己也还有“老好人”想法，不愿得罪人，大伙便首先帮助他们打通了思想，然后分头去动员劝说落后群众。
    老汉刘龙山说：“唉！‘小人命，天官定，刚巴叉，不管用’！（大意：就是动一动，也不中用），头二年俺没法的时候也没病，后来刚倒腾了几趟生意就病了半年，连老本都赔净啦！”干部、积极分子便举了个例子跟他说，杜河廷老婆害汗病快死了，河廷算账要回两串院子、二十四亩地，老婆病也好了。刘龙山却摇摇头说：“唉，人家命里不该死嘛！………俺又不是三岁小孩，要翻身还用得着你们说啦！”村长去劝说卖麻糖的老汉杨文庆，老汉说：“保山，你们为着俺有地种、有房子住，过好时光，俺都知道。不过呀，你讲的话都白搭了。俺当了一辈子好人，临死还去惹人落后赖！？你这话跟俺说说还没关系，可不要再跟旁人说啦。叫人家都说：‘村干部净惹事生非’，多不好！”………
    干部积极分子遇到这种情形，并没有灰心，他们想了个办法，先突破几个典型。
    三、杨家老奶奶诉苦
    全同会村过去共有五百多户，光杨家就占了三百多户，其中数杨七德老婆辈数最大，她在八九十街基点的落后分子会上诉苦说：“杨家数俺辈数大，也数俺最受苛制！俺孤寡老婆一个人，没地种，没柴烧，到杨家祠堂里拿两片柴烧，叫杨锡昌、杨育昌赶猪赶狗一样赶出来，还骂了一顿！七八十的老婆子还要派去伯延给日本修工！……这就是俺好孙子们办的事呀！”“过去俺总觉得都是小辈，算了吧！人家谁还搭理你这个哩！今天想了想，可不能不算算账了。”这些话都打到一帮老汉老婆们的心坎上。卖麻糖老汉杨文庆说：“七奶奶说得对，有钱人孙子变成爷，没钱人爷爷堕成孙子啦！”七奶奶接着说：“俺起先看见枪毙汉奸杨锡昌（外号‘活阎王’）、宋裕民（外号‘大白脸’），还觉得有点可怜。现在想早就该蹦他了，留着他们坐在家里，吃好喝好，成天盘算刻薄咱没法户？！要不是八路军过来，还叫杨锡昌那伙人当家，咱同会街穷人早死的差不多啦！这回俺一定要算账翻透身！”大伙听了，都称赞：七奶奶理说的到。
    永不张嘴的杨文喜老头子，痛快淋漓的诉完杨家地主压迫他的苦，又说：“咱还怕惹人吗，老财骂农会就捎带骂了咱！人家界限划得清格格的，咱也要划清楚些，两国交兵黄河为界！咱没惹他，他先惹咱！”还说：“我可想通了，怕‘变天’不算账也不中用，老蒋还管你算账不算账，你不算账，他也要杀你。”民兵张双货看到老人们比自己都通达，又羞又急地抢着站起来，检讨了自己因“情面”而产生的落后思想以后说：“打破头皮不怕扇子扇！过河不怕大水淹！这回算账少给一个都不行。”这时候，二、三十个人就都嚷嚷起来了。后来谈到积极和落后分子问题，有人又羡慕又不平：“人家岳武昌越翻身越好过越受表扬，咱越不想翻身越受穷，还落个‘落后分子’，咱这次翻身给他们看看。”一个老汉听罢民兵张双货的话，还觉得有点迟疑，老刘龙山却说：“村干部一直说咱们就一点听不进去？其实，算算还不是为了咱自己！”那个老汉点头表示：“说起来也就是。咱脑筋总没有年青人坚决，走着瞧吧！”村长说：“你们就走着瞧吧，啥时候觉得该提意见、该算账，就提就算，不要错过了机会。”
    四、落后分子打头阵
    第二天（七月二十六日），开会斗争十三大户，大伙劲头很足。吓得“西南王”杨绍先等恶霸地主直抖擞。头天黑夜说“走着瞧吧”的人，很多都讲话了，并且还打了头阵，连死了儿子急疯了的杨和尚，也重新上阵了。“等等，俺要跟七楼家算账”！他说着便跳到桌子上，摆动着手臂说：“我十三岁开始当小长工，今年六十四岁了，还是地无一垅、房无一间！光受地主杨七楼家的苦，就诉也诉不尽，大种地还得给人家推磨、挑水、担炭，地主那串新院子也都是俺白出工修起的。受了多半辈子苦，现在不翻身还等到啥时候？”老杨龙喜指手划脚说：“我早先脑筋用石头也砸不开，现在就跟锁子有了钥匙，咯巴一下就开了！”。……会后统计，八十多诉苦人中，有三十多个是过去的落后分子。
    五、“谁还没有个问题咧！”
    开罢大会、开小会，算罢大账、算小账，一直到算账结束的前一天，快散会的时候，佃户杜福来才提问题，大伙问他为啥有意见早不提，他说一直轮不上自己说话。他提这意见实在困难极了，想了又想，不知道该怎个说法才合适？又不知道叫不叫向不在家的地主算账？好几次都是想得差不多，又散会了！今天眼看算账快要结束，才鼓着勇气提，干部们马上鼓励他，杜福来便把对四家地主的意见，全提出来了。一直到分配斗争果实的时候，还有人提出来要算账，例如薛老巨老婆吧，夜里没参加算账，分配地主杨老奎果实才赶到，经过干部和群众说通，也分了些东西。过去最落后的高富贵也要算账了，旁人问他：“你不是说没有问题？”他说：“在旧社会里谁还没有个问题咧！”干部说：“既有问题提吧”，群众说：“提吧”，这样子，分配果实的地方，往往很自然便变成临时的诉苦会，许多老汉老婆们都在这种场合里无拘束地讲话。
    六、浪荡汉要地了
    为了达到“耕者有其田”，这次分配斗争果实，首先分配土地和房子给群众。八月四日经村里“翻身算账委员会”检查结果，除几家毫无劳力另想办法的老人外，还有一户没有土地，并不是没有分配到，而是他不要。这人叫胡福科，家很穷，却不要地。因为他过去是个浪荡公子出身，抽料面把家产都踢踏光了！后来就靠挑水要饭为生，有了几个钱就饱喝几杯酒，醒来没吃的便去讨饭，而且他还知道“八路军不让饿死一个人”，所以便很满足于现在这样的生活。研究了胡福科不要地的原因，算账到最后，便把他请到会场上来，大伙一起帮助他打通思想，劝说道：“以后不能光靠别人吃饭，要生产发家过好时光”，他当场承认要五亩地，下去却又不要了。晚间开会清账的时候，胡福科又来了，他说：“光靠别人吃饭不是办法”，他也是想通了，就是早先没有种过地，干部积极分子知道他怕过后种不了捉他懒汉，便减少二亩给他留下三亩地，他要了。大伙说：“连胡福科都知道要地，咱同会街这回翻身可算是翻好了。”
    七、皆大欢喜
    过去的落后分子这次全卷入诉苦算账运动里来了。就连四五个不能动弹的老人，都把时光作了个对比，八十四岁的杨辰时老婆说：“我心肝眼里知道！早先当保长的光知道要粮要款，咱八路军的保长，光知道叫大家过好时光。咱老得不能动弹，到时候又是米又是面扛到俺家。………这时光俺真是心满意足了，死了也要跟阎王爷说个好。”与她同岁的杨金州老婆，坐下起不来，斗争十三大户时，还要人搀她去听会；全村年纪最大的老汉杨重财，非亲自去领斗争果实不可，他往回走时，他那张无牙的嘴，笑哈哈地说：“俺今年八十六啦，受人家苛刻，不知道还有今天”，他舞着手里的包袱说：“这是咱的东西？这回要回来了”，旁人问他为什么还拿把扫帚，她说：“一扫光！把过去不公的事一扫光”，引得大伙都笑了。
