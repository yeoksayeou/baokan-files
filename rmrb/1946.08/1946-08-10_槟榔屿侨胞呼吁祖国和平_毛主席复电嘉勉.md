Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th—The Penang General Federation of Trade Unions and the Representative Assembly of Labor Groups, etc., sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, calling for an end to the civil war, the establishment of a democratic coalition government, and the end of one-party dictatorship, in order to achieve lasting peace for the country, and urging the United States to withdraw its troops stationed in China as soon as possible and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.

Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, replied as follows:

Your esteemed association's abhorrence of civil war and call for peace, and the various proposals you have put forward, are all pertinent to the current situation and can be described as insightful. Striving for independence, democracy, and peace is the basic policy of our party for national construction after the war, and to resolve the current crisis, the civil war should be stopped, political consultations should be reopened, and all disputes should be resolved through political means; however, warmongers do not seek this, resulting in the continued expansion of the civil war and the increasingly serious situation. Our party will work together with overseas Chinese and the people of the whole country to reverse this dangerous situation and strive to the end in accordance with the principles of peace and democracy.

　　槟榔屿侨胞呼吁祖国和平
    毛主席复电嘉勉
    【新华社延安七日电】槟榔屿各业总工会暨工团代表大会等，致电毛主席，呼吁制止内战，建立民主联合政府，结束一党专政，以期国家之永远和平，并促美国早日撤退在华驻军，停止干涉中国内政。
    中共中央主席毛泽东同志复电如下：
    贵会厌恶内战，呼吁和平，所提各项主张，均切中时弊，堪称卓识。谋独立民主和平，为敝党战后建国之基本方针，而解决当前危机局面，则应停止内战，重开政治协商，一切争端均以政治方式解决；而好战分子不此之图，致内战继续扩大，时局日趋严重。敞党将与海外侨胞与全国人民一致努力，挽此危局，并本和平民主方针奋斗到底。
