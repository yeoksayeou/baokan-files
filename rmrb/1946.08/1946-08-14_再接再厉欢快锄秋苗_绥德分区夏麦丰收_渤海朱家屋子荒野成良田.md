Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: In the Suide District of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, all 200,000 *mu* of wheat fields have yielded a bumper harvest this year. The average harvest is estimated at seven *dou* per *mu*, totaling about 140,000 *shi*. Adding spring wheat, peas, and other early grains, the minimum total harvest is 200,000 *shi*. With a population of 550,000 in the entire district, each person can obtain about 3.6 *dou* of new wheat. It is said to be the first year of bumper harvest since 1930. The people of Haojiaqiao, Tianzhuang, Xizhisazui, Fanjiazhen, and other places in Suide are celebrating the harvest with unparalleled joy in village meetings. At the same time, they continue to organize labor exchange for summer weeding to strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn. Jingxiang Township, Tianzhuang District, Suide, held a harvest celebration meeting on July 17th and awarded Ma Yinhe and model cadre He Yinghua, and six others who actively organized mass production. In Haojiaqiao Village, a sandy area, the masses' mood is even higher. The meeting on the 18th lasted from after dinner until late at night, and the masses were unwilling to disperse, eagerly discussing weeding labor exchange. Hao Yongfeng's labor exchange team challenged Liu Yuhou's labor exchange team, guaranteeing to finish turning over the wheat fields before the end of the summer heat and weeding four times. Liu Yuhou immediately accepted the challenge and proposed organizing children to pull weeds and weed seedlings, and read the newspaper every half month.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: The wheat harvest in the counties of the Yan'an Special District in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was completed successively from the beginning to around the 20th of last month. The total harvest from over 910,000 *mu* of wheat fields in the entire district is approximately 170,000 *shi*, more than double the yield of 75,000 *shi* last year. Lucheng County has the best harvest in the Yan'an area. The wheat in the county contains more than 60 grains per ear, and one *mu* can yield six *dou* (in previous years, each *mu* could only yield three or four *dou*). Labor hero Yang Buting planted a total of 28 *mu* of wheat, harvesting over 30 *shi*, an average of more than one *shi* per *mu*. Among them, the best six *mu* of wheat fields yielded a total of 15 *shi*, an average of 2.5 *shi* per *mu*. In various places, many women went up the mountains to participate in the harvest. In Yanchuan County, in the Huosheng District alone, over 500 women participated in the wheat harvest.

Huimin, 6th: In the Bohai District, in Kenli County (a new county, the northeastern part of the original Lijin County), a once desolate and uninhabited area, there is a Zhu Jia Wu Zi Village. Before the War of Resistance, poor and destitute farmers came to this wasteland to reclaim land many times, but they were forced to flee due to the extreme exploitation of the Kuomintang authorities, bandit disturbances, and Yellow River floods. After the Eighth Route Army liberated the area in 1941, farmers flocked to the area to reclaim land under the encouragement of the democratic government. Over the years, they have established the area into a prosperous village of 230 households. Starting from scratch, the economic status of the farmers has continuously improved. There are now eleven rich peasant households, over 180 middle peasant households, and over 50 poor people who have established their own families. The entire village of over 900 people has over 3,500 *mu* of land and over 100 head of livestock. Merchants gather at every market, and the scenery inside and outside the village is beautiful. Every time the sun sets, herds of cattle and horses return from the riverbank, and fishermen carry fish ashore from small boats. The entire village is filled with an atmosphere of abundance and joy.

　　再接再厉欢快锄秋苗            
    绥德分区夏麦丰收           
    渤海朱家屋子荒野成良田
    【新华社延安十一日电】陕甘宁边区绥德分区，今年二十万垧麦地全部丰收。平均收获量每垧以大斗七斗计算，共约收十四万石，加上春麦、碗豆等早粮最低共可收二十万石。全分区五十五万人口，一个人约可得新麦三斗六升，据说为民国十九年以来的第一个丰收年。绥德郝家桥、田庄、西直沙、范家圳等地人民，一面以无比欢快的心情分开村民大会庆祝丰收，一面再接再厉继续组织变工夏锄，以争取秋天丰收。绥德田庄区井乡，于七月十七日举行丰收庆祝会大会，奖励了积极组织群众生产的马银合和模范干部贺英华等六人。沙区郝家桥村，群众情绪更高，十八日大会从晚饭后一直开到深夜，群众还不肯散，热烈讨论锄草变工。郝永丰变工队向刘玉厚变工队提出竞赛，保证赶伏尽翻完麦地、锄四次草。刘玉厚即起应战，并提出组织娃娃拔草锄苗，半月读一次报。
    【新华社延安六日电】陕甘宁边区延安专区各县，麦收已于上月初至二十日左右先后完毕。全分区九十一万余亩麦田，共约收麦十七万石，产量较去年之七万五千石超过一倍。鹿县丰收为延属之冠，该县的麦子每穗包藏着六十余粒，一亩可收六斗（往年每亩只能收三四斗）。劳动英雄杨步挺，共种了二十八亩麦子，收麦三十余石，平均每垧一石多，其中有六垧最好的麦田，共收麦十五石，平均每垧收麦二石五斗。各地在收割中很多妇女上山参加，仅延川县或胜区三乡，即有五百余妇女参加麦收。
    【惠民六日电】渤海区过去荒无人烟的垦利县（新县，原利津县东北部）有一个朱家屋子村，抗战前穷苦无依的农民，曾多次来到这荒原上开垦，但均因国民党当局极度压榨，土匪扰乱，黄河水灾等原因，被迫逃散。民国三十年八路军解放后，农民在民主政府奖励下纷至该地拓荒，几年来将该地建立成一所二百三十户的繁荣村庄。垦民白手起家，经济地位不断上升，现有富农十一户，中农一百八十余户，五十多个贫民都已成家立业，全庄九百余人，有地三千五百余亩，有牲口百余头，每集商贩云集，庄内外风景秀丽，每当夕阳西下时，成群牛马从河畔归来，渔夫从小船上担鱼上岸，全村充满丰裕欢乐的景象。
