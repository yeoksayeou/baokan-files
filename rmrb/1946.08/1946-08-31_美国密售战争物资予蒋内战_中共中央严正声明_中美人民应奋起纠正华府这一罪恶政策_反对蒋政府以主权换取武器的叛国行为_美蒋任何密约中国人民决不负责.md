　　US Secretly Sells War Materials for Chiang's Civil War
    CPC Central Committee Issues Solemn Statement
    Chinese and American People Should Rise Up to Correct This Sinister Policy of Washington
    Oppose Chiang Government's Treasonous Act of Exchanging Sovereignty for Weapons
    Chinese People Will Not Be Responsible for Any Secret Agreements Between the US and Chiang
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 28th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China declares: According to reliable sources, the representatives of the US Liquidation Materials Committee recently arrived in China, including Assistant Secretary of the Army Petersen and other American military personnel, are negotiating with the Chiang Kai-shek government to sell a huge amount of surplus American war materials in the Western Pacific. The total value of these materials reaches hundreds of millions of US dollars (far exceeding the total value of US aid to Chiang's lend-lease materials since Japan's surrender, estimated to be sufficient for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war for two years), which will be supplied to Chiang Kai-shek at a low price of 50 million US dollars, in order to prevent the full-scale civil war that Chiang is currently waging with American support from ending one day due to insufficient ammunition; on that day, the "Chinese peace" verbally requested by the US government will truly be realized. The only issue not yet resolved in this negotiation is transportation. Chiang Kai-shek is prepared to cede China's airspace rights in exchange for the shipment of these materials from the United States to China. The success of this negotiation will further demonstrate the hypocrisy, imperialism, and cruelty of the US government's policy toward China. The Washington authorities, who are full of talk of peace, seem to feel a strange pleasure in seeing their allied people bombarded to death by American artillery fire, just like the nobles of the late Roman Empire enjoying Roman slaves being devoured by beasts in the arena. Therefore, they are determined to "assist" dear China so that the Chinese nation will perish in a long-term barbaric performance that entertains their "one person" in the White House. The Communist Party of China calls on all the Chinese people, all the American people, and all the people of the United Nations to rise up together to oppose and stop this sinful transaction, to oppose and correct the US authorities' sinister policy of insisting on creating civil war in China, and to oppose and not recognize the Chiang Kai-shek government's treasonous act of selling out sovereignty in exchange for foreign weapons to slaughter compatriots. The Communist Party of China believes that any secret agreements and protocols between the US and Chiang in this and similar negotiations are illegal, and the Chinese people will not bear any responsibility for this.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 28th: The Shanghai Office of the Communist Party of China held a reception for the press at 10 Massenet Road, Shanghai, at 3:00 PM on the 27th. More than 50 Chinese and foreign reporters attended. According to a report by the Associated Press, "The CCP reiterated at the meeting its condemnation of the United States' secret sale of surplus military supplies to the Kuomintang government and demanded that the United States cease the current secret negotiations." Spokesman Chen Jiakang said, "If Marshall's mission is to succeed, the United States must stop aiding China." Chen condemned the Foreign Liquidation Commission's recent agreement to lend China between 150 million and 200 million US dollars to purchase American military surplus supplies in the Pacific. He said: The negotiations are currently being conducted by Song Ziwen with US Secretary of the Army Patterson and Foreign Liquidation Commission Director McCabe.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 28th: According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 26th, "It has been learned here that the Shanghai office of the US Liquidation Commission has handed over ten American Mitchell medium bombers suitable for flight to the Chinese-operated China National Aviation Corporation. This move appears to be in direct violation of US federal regulations, which stipulate that no combat equipment may be sold without the approval of the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff."
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Central News Agency reported: Former commander of the US 14th Air Force in China, Major General Chennault, arrived in Shanghai by air from the United States on the 26th. It is reported that Chen's visit will still help the Kuomintang government in its aviation construction work.

　　美国密售战争物资予蒋内战
    中共中央严正声明
    中美人民应奋起纠正华府这一罪恶政策
    反对蒋政府以主权换取武器的叛国行为
    美蒋任何密约中国人民决不负责
    【新华社延安二十八日电】中共中央委员会声明：据可靠消息：最近来华的美国清算物资委员会代表陆军部助理彼得生和其他美国军事人员，正与蒋介石政府谈判出卖美国在西部太平洋的巨量剩余战争物资。此项物资的总值达到了万万美元（远远超过日本投降以来美国助蒋租借物资的总值，据估计足供蒋介石内战两年之用），将以五万万美元的低价供给蒋介石，以免蒋现在依靠美国支持而进行的全面内战在某一天将因军火不足而终止；在那一天，美国政府所口头要求的“中国和平”将真正实现。这个谈判现仅有运输问题尚未解决，蒋介石准备出让中国的领空权，以换取美国这批物资运来中国。这个谈判结果成功，将进一步表示美国政府对华政策的虚伪性、帝国主义性与残酷性。满口和平的华盛顿当局，似乎因为看到其盟国人民被美国炮火所轰毙而感觉奇异的快乐，好像罗马末日的贵族欣赏罗马奴隶在竞技场上被野兽所吞食时一样。所以决心“援助”亲爱的中国，以便中国民族在长期娱乐其白宫“一人”的野蛮表演中归于灭亡。中国共产党要求全中国人民、全美国人民和一切联合国人民，一致奋起，反对和制止这个罪恶的买卖，反对和纠正美国当局坚持制造中国内战的罪恶政策，反对和不承认蒋介石政府出卖主权、以换取外国武器屠杀同胞的叛国行为。中国共产党认为美蒋在此项和同类谈判中的任何密约、协议都是非法的，中国人民对此决不负任何责任。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】中共驻沪办事处，二十七日下午三时在上海马斯南路十号招待新闻界，到中外记者五十余人。据美联社电称：“中共在会上重新谴责美国将剩余的军事供应品秘密售予国民党政府，并要求美国停止目前秘密谈判。”发言人陈家康称：“若要使马歇尔的任务成功，则美国必须停止援华。”陈某谴责外国清算委员会最近同意借与中国一万万五千万到二万万美元之间的一笔借款，以购买美国在太平洋上的军事剩余供应品。他说：该谈判现正由宋子文与美国陆军部长柏德逊及国外清算委员会负责人麦克比进行协商中。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据合众社上海二十六日电称：“此间获悉美国清理委员会上海办事处，已将适于飞行的美国米舍尔中型轰炸机十架交给中国人经营的中央航空公司。此举看来直接违反美国联邦条例，该条例规定未经国务院及联合参谋长之批准，不得出卖任何作战装备”。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】中央社讯：前美国驻华十四航空队司令陈纳德少将，已于二十六日由美飞抵沪。闻陈氏此来，仍将帮助国民党政府致力于航空建设工作。
