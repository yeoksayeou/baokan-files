　　A War of the Masses
　　Su Jiao
　　Hongtong County is a famous cotton, rice, and wheat producing area in Shanxi. Before the War of Resistance, the people's lives were exceptionally wealthy. After Yan Xishan abandoned it to the enemy, it suffered great destruction in the eight years that followed. After the Japanese surrender, the traitorous county magistrate of Anze, Zhang Conglong, was not only not punished, but was even more heavily relied upon by Yan Xishan, serving as the chairman of the Tongchou Committee of Hongtong, and later concurrently as the county magistrate. He occupied the county seat and nine other strongholds with a regiment of puppet troops. He was a notorious murderer. No less than three thousand anti-Japanese personnel and civilians died at his hands. After he killed Comrade Ma Yuting of the 19th Sub-district Public Security Supervision Office in Subao, he even cut out his heart and stir-fried it to eat. He was the most cannibalistic beast. Under his burning, killing, and looting, the people of eleven villages within five miles of the county seat all fled, turning the area into a "no-man's land."
　　When I and my unit arrived at Fengcun, we encountered an emaciated sixty-one-year-old woman carrying a white cloth bag, hurrying past me, constantly repeating, as if chanting a scripture, "Truly a savior, truly a savior...". Later, she turned back and told me that her old man had been forced by Zhang Conglong to run to the eastern mountains, and she, her widowed daughter-in-law, and the children had been so hungry at home that they had thought of suicide several times. Yan Xishan had ordered the formation of units, but because there was not a single man of eligible age in her family, all the land in her home was to be confiscated. Just then, the Eighth Route Army arrived. As she spoke, she patted the cloth bag on her back and said, "The unit came at night, and I wanted to cook for you, but there was nothing. Today, I have to borrow some flour to make some food for you." These words moved me to tears. I calculated that she had already walked ten miles to borrow the flour.
　　As soon as the unit stepped into the territory of Hongtong, everyone was extremely surprised. Because the usually steep mountain roads had been transformed into flat, wide avenues. Along the way, we saw that every village had prepared tea. The villagers of Jicun, Wangtou, Baicun, and Subi had even prepared watermelon and fruit. As we passed by, they swarmed over and stuffed the fruit into our hands. Our soldiers were all moved and said, "How should we repay the people?"
　　The people made thirty cloud ladders and dozens of springboards for the troops, as well as fly swatters for pulling landmines. On the march, the villagers crowded on both sides shouting slogans such as "Welcome the Eighth Route Army to liberate Hongtong City" and "The Eighth Route Army is the savior of the people of Hongtong!" They wrote a letter to the troops saying, "Whoever, whichever unit, captures or kills Zhang Conglong, we will specially reward them with ten fat pigs weighing over seventy catties each."
　　The villagers themselves organized casualty transit stations. Because they were afraid of air raids, they had all the wounded stay in cave dwellings. Each cave dwelling housed five people, with someone to care for them, someone to cook, and someone to wash clothes. The children swatted flies, the women helped carry stretchers, and militiamen escorted them to ensure safety. ... There were four large battalions of militiamen automatically cooperating with the army in combat, as well as hundreds of stretcher teams. Originally, they did not have frontline rescue duties, but they automatically rushed to the front to rescue the wounded.
　　Before the battle began, I saw a political commissar standing in the middle of the troops, loudly saying, "We are the people's army. The people are so eager for us to eliminate the traitor Zhang Conglong, what else can we say...".
　　Our main force was in the east, and Zhang Conglong's puppet troops were also concentrated in the east city. We had to enter from the east gate, and the enemy was determined to defend the east gate. Under the cover of our intense artillery fire, the heroes of the grenade throwing team bravely stood on the edge of the outer moat, throwing grenades into the fortifications on the city. An enemy grenade exploded in our crowd, but more grenade throwers surged to the edge of the moat. The first ladder was erected on the east city wall, and the enemy threw large rocks from the city. The second ladder was immediately erected, and the enemy knocked it down with force. But the third ladder was finally erected on the left side of the east gate. The soldiers swarmed up the city wall. Many people were knocked down by poison gas, but even more people rushed up. A bullet swept one down, and someone immediately replaced him. Many people were injured, but none wanted to leave the front line. Dust covered the entire gate tower and bunker, and the shell broke the stone plaque on the gate. Zhang Conglong panicked and was writing orders at home, telling the troops on the city to retreat to Liujia Courtyard. But halfway through writing the order, the troops from the west gate rushed into the city. He hurriedly dropped the unfinished order and fled with his wife. But it was already too late, he had just escaped down the wall when he was killed. At dusk, the troops all entered the city. The ten major strongholds composed of more than a hundred bunkers were completely liberated by the people on August 16th.
　　After the battle, the people of Hongtong, with boundless joy, presented the troops with two large banners, one reading: "Savior of the People of Hongtong," and the other reading: "Not to violate the people's property".

　　群众性的战争
    苏茭
    洪洞县是山西著名的棉、稻、小麦产地。抗战以前人民生活异常富裕，自阎锡山丢给敌人以后，八年间遭受很大的破坏。日本投降后，安泽汉奸县长张从龙不但没有得到惩办，反而被阎锡山更加重用，担任了洪洞的统委会长，后又兼县长。他带着一个团的伪军，盘踞着县城和其他九个据点。他是个有名的杀人魔王。死在他手下的抗日人员和群众不下三千人。他在苏堡将我十九分区公安督察处的马玉亭同志杀死后，把心也剜出炒着吃。他是最能吃人心的野兽。在他烧杀抢劫下，城关附近五里的十一个村庄人民都逃避一空，变成“无人区”。
    我和队伍到冯村时，碰见了一个六十一岁骨瘦如柴的老太太，扛着一个白布口袋急急的从我身边走过，嘴里像念经一样，不断重复的喃喃说着：“真是救命恩人，真是救命恩人……………”。后来她翻回身来告诉我，她老汉被张从龙逼的跑到东山，她和寡妇媳妇小孩子在家里饿的几次想寻死。阎锡山叫编组，因为她家里没有一个合乎年龄的男人，家里地全要充公。正在这时候八路军来了。说着她拍着背上的布袋告我说：“夜黑了队伍来，我想给你们做饭吃，可是什也没什。今天我怎样也得借点面给你们做点饭吃。”这话使我感动的几乎哭出来，我算了算，她老人家为了借面，已走了十里地了。
    队伍一踏上洪洞的境界，都异常惊讶起来。因为平日险峻的山路都变成了坦平的大道了。一路上看到每个村庄都预备了茶水在吉村、王头、柏村、苏壁的老乡们且预备了西瓜和水果。当我们经过时，他们就蜂拥地跑来，把水果塞进我们的手中。我们战士们都感动的说：“咱们该怎样报答老百姓呢？”
    老百姓给部队做下了三十付云梯和几十付跳板，还有拉地雷的蝇子。在行军的路上，老乡们挤在两边呼口号“欢迎八路军解放洪洞城”、“八路军是洪洞人民的救星！”他们写了一封信给部队说：“不管那个人，那个单位，捉住或打死张从龙，我们特慰劳十口七十斤以上的肥猪。”
    老乡们自己组织了伤兵转运站。因为怕飞机捣乱，他们让伤员全部住在窑洞里。每个窑洞五个人，有人照护，有人作饭，有人洗衣服。小孩们打蝇子，女人们帮着抬担架，还有民兵护送，保证安全。……他们自动配合军队作战的民兵有四个大营，还有几百付担架队。本来他们没有火线抢救任务，可是他们自动涌上火线抢救伤员。
    在战斗开始以前，我看见一个政委站在队伍中间高声讲着：“我们是人民的军队，老百姓这样迫切地要求我们消灭汉奸张从龙，我们还有什么说………………”。
    我们主力在东面，张从龙的伪军也都集中在东城。我们要从东门进去，敌人要死守东门。在我们猛烈的炮火掩护下，投弹组的英雄们，勇敢的站在外壕一边，把一个个手榴弹投在城上的工事里。敌人一颗手榴弹在我们人群中爆炸了，可是更多的投弹手涌到壕边。第一个梯子在东城墙上立起来了，敌人从城上投下大块石头。第二个梯子又马上立起来了，敌人又把他用力掀倒了。可是第三个梯子终于在东门左边立起来。战士们蜂拥似地冲上城墙。许多人被毒气冲倒了，更多的人又拥了上去。子弹扫倒了一个，马上就又有人补上。许多人挂了彩，但都不愿下火线。灰尘把整个的城门楼和碉堡都遮住了，炮弹把门上的石匾额都打破了。张从龙惊慌的在家里写着命令，叫城上的部队退守刘家院。可是命令写了一半，西门的队伍冲进城了。他慌忙丢下那半张命令，带着老婆逃走。可是已经晚了，他刚逃下墙。就被打死了。在暮色苍茫的时候，部队全进了城。由一百多碉堡构成的十个大据点，在八月十六日这一天完全为人民解放了。
    洪洞人民在战后带着无限的喜悦，送给部队两面大旗，一面写着：“洪洞人民救星”：一面写着：“秋毫无犯”。
