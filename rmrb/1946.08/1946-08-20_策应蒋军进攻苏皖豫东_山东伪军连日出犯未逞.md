　　To coordinate with Chiang's troops in attacking eastern Suwan and Yuyu, Shandong puppet troops have launched attacks for days to contain our army. They have now been crushed by the Eighth Route Army in various places. On the 7th, Wu Huawen's puppet troops, stationed in Yanzhou, with more than 300 men, invaded Daogou area in our liberated area. They were defeated and retreated on the same day, with 40 captured alive. On the 9th, Li Lianxiang's puppet troops, stationed in Wei Village northwest of Qihe, with more than 70 men, invaded Zuo Village and Zhao Wanzhuang area southeast of Qihe in our area. They were repelled after our army bravely resisted, and fled in panic. On the 10th, more than 400 puppet troops from Liaocheng invaded the liberated areas north and southwest of the city in several directions. After a day of fierce fighting, the puppet troops suffered more than 50 casualties.
    【This newspaper, Handan, 16th】In response to Chiang's troops on the Longhai Front, Nationalist airplanes have continuously bombed our Yongnian peaceful residents for four days. On the 12th of this month, the areas of Nanqiao and Xitatidi in Yongnian suffered two bombings and strafings. The Kuomintang dispatched as many as ten airplanes. The next morning, five Chiang planes flew again to bomb and strafe repeatedly the areas of Jiadi, Qiuquan, and Yancun outside Yongnian city, killing three residents. In the afternoon, Chiang's planes came in two batches, one of five and one of three. On the 14th and 15th, thirteen Chiang planes bombed the Nanqiao and Yancun areas again, causing extremely heavy losses to the residents. A young child in Hantun was also killed in the bombing. This bombing occurred while the Yongnian group of the Beiping Executive Headquarters was convening representatives of the three parties in Ping to discuss the Yongnian issue. The Kuomintang, relying on American planes, brazenly bombed peaceful residents, which has aroused extreme indignation among the people of Yongnian. Second Lieutenant Lei, a member of the U.S. team of the group stationed in Handan, has reported to the Beiping Executive Headquarters.
