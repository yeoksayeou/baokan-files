Xinhua News Agency, Southern Jiangsu Front, 26th: On the morning of the 22nd, the New Fourth Army on the southern front of central Jiangsu launched a self-defense counterattack against the Chiang troops occupying the important towns of Dingyan and Linzi (both occupied simultaneously on July 17th) southeast of Rugao, annihilating two regiments, totaling seven battalions, of the Chiang army's Transportation Column, composed of Dai Li's special agents, and the remnants of the 26th Brigade of the 49th Division (formerly the 26th Division of the 49th Army), totaling over 5,000 men. All were equipped with American weaponry, and the captured materials are currently being inventoried. This marks the fourth crushing defeat inflicted on the Chiang troops invading central Jiangsu since their large-scale offensive in mid-July, following the previous annihilating blows at Taixing, southern Rugao, and east of Haian. To date, the Chiang troops have lost over 36,000 officers and soldiers on the southern front of central Jiangsu alone, not including the losses inflicted on the Chiang troops by local militia and guerrillas. The Rugao line is the main direction of the Chiang army's offensive on the southern front. Since the Chiang army occupied Rugao City on the 23rd of last month, they have only advanced north to Haian Town, over 20 kilometers from Rugao City, in the past month. Dingyan and Linzi are both located on the transportation line from Nantong to Rugao. As of now, the eastern and southeastern parts of Rugao occupied by the Chiang army have been threatened.

This newspaper, Yangcheng, 25th: In the victorious self-defense operation in Huo County, a total of over 2,000 Yan-puppet troops, including the 3rd Regiment of the 44th Division and the "Love the Homeland Corps," were completely disarmed by the Eighth Route Army. We captured five mortars, six heavy machine guns, 150 light machine guns, and two radio stations. The surrounding strongholds of the city, including Zhangjiabao, Bailong Village, Tandiqi, Dazhang, Xizhang, Shima, Tuisha, Wangzhuang, Yangjiashan, and Baishan, more than ten locations in all, have been completely cleared by the Eighth Route Army.

This newspaper, Changzhi, 25th: On the morning of the 22nd, over 1,200 Yan-puppet troops, including Shen Rui of the 71st Division of the Yan army, from Yangquan and Langyu stations (both under Pinding County) on the Zhengtai Line, attacked the Nangouzhang area in the western liberated area of Pinding County. Our army rose up in self-defense and, after four hours of fierce fighting, killed and wounded over 200 Yan-puppet troops, captured over ten, and seized one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, and dozens of rifles. The remaining Yan-puppet troops, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and retreated.

　　苏中南线我军四次自卫获捷
    美式蒋军五千被歼
    霍县之战阎伪军二千余被解除武装
    【新华社苏中前线二十六日电】苏中前线新四军于二十二日上午向侵占如皋东南之重镇丁堰、林梓（七月十七日同时被占）地区蒋军举行自卫反击，歼灭蒋军由戴系特务组成之交通纵队两个总队共七个大队，与四十九师二十六旅（原四十九军二十六师）残余，全部共五千余人，全系美械装备，缴获正清查中。按此为侵犯苏中蒋军自七月中旬大举进攻以来，继泰兴、如皋南部、海安以东三次遭受歼灭打击后之第四次惨败。至此，仅苏中南线蒋军损失官兵即在三万六千人以上，当地民兵与游击队给予蒋军之损失尚未计算在内。如皋一线为南线蒋军进攻之主要方向，自上月二十三日蒋军侵占如皋城后，一月来仅向北进展至距如城二十余公里之海安镇。丁堰、林梓两地均处于南通至如皋之交通线上。至此，蒋军侵占下之如皋东部及东南部，均已受到威胁。
    【本报阳城二十五日电】霍县自卫胜利作战中，阎伪军四十四师第三团及“爱乡团”，共两千余人，全部为八路军解除武装。我缴获迫击炮五门、重机枪六挺、轻机枪一百五十挺、电台两部。城周据点张家堡、白龙村、坛底、大张、西张、什茫、退沙、王庄、杨家山、白山等十余处，当为八路军完全扫除。
    【本报长治二十五日电】二十二日上午正太线阳泉及狼峪车站（均平定县属）阎伪军七十一师沈瑞等共一千二百余，犯我平定县西部解放区南沟掌一带，我军奋起自卫，激战四小时，毙伤阎伪二百余、俘十余人、缴重机枪一挺、送葬轻机枪四挺、步枪数十支。阎伪残部不支溃退。
