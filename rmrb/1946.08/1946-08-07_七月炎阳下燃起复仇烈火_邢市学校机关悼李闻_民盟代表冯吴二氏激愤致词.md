Fueled by the Fiery Sun of July, Revengeful Flames Ignite

Xingtai City Schools and Organizations Mourn Li and Wen

China Democratic League Representatives Feng and Wu Deliver Incensed Speeches

[Report from our Northern University Correspondent] A memorial meeting for the two martyrs, Li and Wen, organized by various schools, organizations, and groups in Xingtai City, primarily led by Peking University (Beida), was held at the Beida sports ground at 8:00 AM on the 30th. The venue was arranged with extreme solemnity and tranquility. Passing through a filial archway made of cypress branches, alongside the green, shaded path, long white banners filled the scene, bearing elegies and memorial couplets. On the stage were placed the memorial tablets of the martyrs, draped with purplish-red and grayish-blue curtains. Below the stage, various wreaths, handmade by organizations, schools, and the faculty and students of Beida, were displayed, alongside various "wall newspapers" specially published in memory of the two martyrs, as well as "newspaper clippings" reflecting the current democratic and anti-democratic struggle. All these items dedicated to mourning the dead fully represented everyone's inner grief and anger!

The meeting commenced at 8:30 AM, attended by representatives from the Municipal Government, district offices, the Federation of Commerce, Xinhua Bookstore, Xingtai Normal School, Agricultural Vocational School, Yide Middle School, the Elementary and Middle School Teachers' Weekly Training Class, the Catholic Church, the Christian Church, as well as faculty and students of Beida staying on campus during the summer vacation, numbering five to six hundred people. Also present were Ms. Feng Wei and Mr. Wu Jinglüe, representatives of the China Democratic League, who were recently passing through from Beiping.

Chairman Luo Qing's few simple and mournful opening remarks struck a chord in the heart of every attendee. Indeed, "This is a memorial meeting, but also a revenge meeting, a self-defense meeting! Revenge against whom? Self-defense against whom? Revenge against the fascist Chiang Kai-shek who murdered our democratic comrades and attacked our liberated areas, and a self-defense!" Under the fiery July sun, everyone sweated, but also burned with grief and revenge, commemorating the dead with a dual sentiment.

Following the solemn public memorial ceremony, Peking University President Fan Wenlan first pointed out that the assassination of the two martyrs was, on the one hand, our loss, but on the other hand, we must also see that Chiang Kai-shek is at his wit's end, and has had to resort to gangster assassination tactics. Now, in various places, Kuomintang troops are constantly rebelling and withdrawing from the civil war. Chiang Kai-shek has reached the point of the Xinhai Revolution, the Wuchang Uprising, the responses from various places, and the collapse of the Manchu Qing Dynasty.

China Democratic League representative Mr. Wu, after narrating the biographies of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen, said: "Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were both leaders of the China Democratic League. We are also preparing to hold a memorial meeting in Beiping, but there we cannot find a public place to hold the memorial meeting, because there is no freedom for us there. Mr. Wen Yiduo was assassinated when he was walking out of Mr. Li Gongpu's memorial meeting venue. Those of us who are preparing to hold the memorial meeting must be prepared to take the third bullet..."

Ms. Feng Wei said very excitedly: "The Kuomintang killed our leaders, and they don't even allow us to cry there, don't allow us to mourn. Is there any country in the world that is so reactionary?" "All of our cultural workers are living half-starved lives. All of our China Democratic League workers are included in the secret agents' blacklist. Young students are being arrested everywhere. Everyone is in danger of being murdered and imprisoned in concentration camps. How can we be like you, freely breathing, freely studying, working, and researching in a free paradise?" "The Kuomintang keeps saying that no party in any country has an army, and that if the CCP does not lay down its arms, it must be eliminated. The facts are most obvious. Our China Democratic League is not armed. We demand peace and democracy. Isn't that very reasonable? However, we have suffered massacres. If the Communist Party lays down its weapons today, I dare to guarantee that the Communist Party would not be able to exist for long, and you would never get such a peaceful, democratic, and free paradise. This is an iron fact, this is a lesson learned from blood!" When Ms. Feng said this, applause thundered throughout the venue. The shouts of "We must repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive! We must help the people in the Kuomintang areas!" echoed through the clouds. Finally, Mr. Feng Wei firmly said: "We have resolute confidence that Chiang Kai-shek cannot kill all of the millions of peace-loving and democratic people in the country! The cause of peace and democracy will surely be victorious."

Finally, after speeches by Xingtai Normal School Principal Wang Yonglie, Federation of Commerce Chairman Zhang, and other representatives, the meeting passed two telegrams: one protesting the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary secret agent group, and one expressing condolences to the families of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen.

　　七月炎阳下燃起复仇烈火
    邢市学校机关悼李闻
    民盟代表冯吴二氏激愤致词
    【本报北方大学讯】以北大为主的邢市各学校机关团体追悼李闻二烈士大会于三十日上午八时在北大操场举行，会场布置极为庄严静穆，通过柏枝搭成的孝坊，绿树荫翳的甬道旁，张满了长幅的白布标语，与挽词挽联，台上置着烈士的灵位，绛紫和青灰色的幔幕垂挂着，台下更陈列着各机关学校及北大师生亲手制备的各种形状的花圈，以及专为追悼两烈士而刊出的多种《壁报》、反映目前民主与反民主斗争情况的《剪报》，这许许多多祭挽死者的东西，充分的代表着大家内心的悲痛与怒火！
    八时半开会，到会有市政府、各区署、商联会、新华书店、邢台师范、农职学校、义德中学、中小教员星期讲习班、天主堂、基督教会等代表与北大暑假留校师生五六百人，另有最近从北平路过此地的民盟代表冯伟女士与吴景略先生。
    主席罗青先生几句简短沉痛的开幕词，打中在每个与会者的心坎上。是的，“这是追悼大会，也是复仇大会，自卫大会！对谁复仇？对谁自卫？对杀死我们的民主战友和进攻我们解放区的法西斯蒋介石复仇和举行自卫！”大家在七月的烈日下，挥着汗，也燃着悲痛与复仇的烈火，以双重的心情来祭奠死者。
    隆重的公祭礼成，北大校长范文澜先生，首先指出二烈士的被暗杀，一方面是我们的损失，另一方面我们也要看到蒋介石已经毫无办法，不得不用流氓暗杀政策。现在各处国民党的部队不断起义退出内战，蒋介石已经到了辛亥革命、武昌起义、各地响应、满清垮台时的地步。
    民盟代表吴先生叙述了李闻二先生简历之后说：“李闻二先生都是民盟的领导人，我们在北平也正筹备开追悼会，但是在那里我们找不到一个能开追悼会的公共场所，因为那里没有我们的自由，闻一多先生就是在走出李公朴先生追悼会会场时被暗杀的，我们准备开追悼会的人，都必须抱着吃第三颗子弹的决心……”
    冯伟女士非常激动的说：“国民党杀了我们的领导者，在他们那里还不许我们哭，不许我们追悼，世界上还有没有像这样反动的国家？”“我们所有的文化工作者，没有不是过着半饥饿的生活，我们所有的民盟工作者，都列入了特务的黑名单，青年学生普遍的被捕，人人都有遭残杀被关入集中营去的危险，那能像你们这样在自由的乐园里，自由呼吸，自由研究学习和工作？”“国民党口口声声说任何国家的党派都没有军队，中共若不放下武器非消灭中共不可。事实最明显，我们民盟是没有武装的，我们要求和平与民主，这不是很合理的吗？但是，我们却遭受了屠杀，假如今天共产党放下了武器，我敢保证共产党早也存在不住，你们也绝得不到这样和平民主自由的乐园，这是铁的事实，这是血的教训！”冯女士讲至此，全场的掌声雷动，“我们要击退蒋介石的进攻！我们要援助国民党区的老百姓。”的口号声响彻了云霄，最后冯伟先生坚决的说：“我们有坚决的自信，全国千千万万的和平民主人士，蒋介石是杀不完的！和平民主事业一定能得到胜利。”
    最后在邢师校长王永烈先生、商联会张主席等代表陆续讲话之后，大会通过抗议蒋介石反动特务集团罪行与慰问李闻二先生家属的两个通电。
