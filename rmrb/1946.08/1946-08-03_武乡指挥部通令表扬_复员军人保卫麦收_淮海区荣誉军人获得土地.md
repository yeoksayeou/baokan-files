　　【Benbao Changzhi Xun】More than 40 demobilized soldiers resettled in the seventh district of Wu Xiang, in order to avenge the compatriots who were killed in the Qingxiu massacre and protect the masses' wheat harvest, voluntarily formed a temporary guerrilla team. Led by Cheng Erwang, they went to the vicinity of Nangou in Wu Xiang, on the eastern Qin line, to cover the wheat harvest in the area. The stubborn puppets harassed them twice, but were repelled.
