The people of the old liberated areas of Wushe, tempered by eight or nine years of revolution and possessing a habit of mutual assistance, are promoting the spirit of mutual aid that "laboring people are one family" and going to the new districts to support production. After weeding the first and second crops, the people of She County and Wuxi (now merged with Wu'an) formed groups and went to the new Wu'an district to help with weeding, receiving a warm welcome from the local people. They said, "It's still good under the leadership of the Eighth Route Army; who would have cared about this in the past!" When the Fifth District of Wuxi merged with the Second District of Wu'an, the cadres of the new district asked the comrades of the old district to provide more help in their work. The comrades of the old district said, "This is our duty. The new district lacks labor, and we will also help you with production." After returning, villages such as Hedi, Baiguan, Shierzhuang, and Tanling drew some militiamen and self-defense forces to help weed in villages such as Yuquanling, Shangbaishi, Xiabaishi, Yuanloubaishi, and Shangquan. They were divided into squads and platoons, led by buglers, with established discipline, and acted very consistently. They all weeded patiently and actively, and even slight carelessness would be criticized by the squad. The people of the new district also treated them with enthusiasm. In the past, workers lived in temples, but now they live in the homes of those they help. In the past, those who didn't work a full day because of rain were not given food or full wages, but today everyone eats the same, and the food is good. During breaks, they talked very intimately, with the masses of the old district talking about their experience of becoming rich through mutual aid in production, and the new district talking about their deeds of emancipation struggle. A team of fewer than a hundred people weeded more than one qing of land clean every day. When they left a week later, the villagers sent them off as if they were saying goodbye to relatives, sending them a long way and paying them wages. They refused, but the newly emancipated people felt bad and insisted on giving everyone between one hundred, two hundred, and three hundred yuan per day. An old self-defense team member told the reporter: "This is different from those two years. In the past, we worked for the landlords, and it was terrible in the fields. Whoever went ahead would be hit with clods of earth, and whoever weeded deeply would be said to have 'silver underneath'? Now we are helping our newly emancipated people, and if we don't weed well, we feel bad."

　　武涉老区人民支援新区锄苗
    【本报讯】经八九年革命洗礼具有互助习惯的老解放区人民，发扬“劳动人民是一家”的互助精神，到新区支援生产。涉县、武西（已与武安合并）人民，于锄完头二遍苗后，便成群结队的开赴武安新区帮助锄苗，受到当地人民热烈欢迎。他们说：“还是八路军领导的好，过去谁管这事呢！”武西五区与武安二区合并时，新区干部要求老区同志在工作上多帮助，老区同志说：“这是我们的义务。新区劳力缺，我们还要帮助你们生产。”回去后，河底、白官、史儿庄、坦岭等村便抽了些民兵与自卫队，到玉泉岭、上白石、下白石、园楼白石、上泉等村帮助锄苗。他们分班排队，带着号兵，订有纪律，行动非常一致，都是耐心又积极的赶锄，稍马虎些就会受到班里批评。新区人民也以热诚相待，以前工人住庙，现在给谁家帮助就在谁家住，过去破工（因雨不够全工者）不给饭吃，不给全工钱，今日吃饭完全一样，吃得也好。休息时，他们便很亲热的交谈着，老区群众谈他互助生产由穷变富的经验，新区则谈他们的翻身斗争事迹，不到一百人的队伍，每天有一顷多地锄的精光。当他们在一礼拜以后离开的时候，村里人如别亲人一样，送的很远，并付给他们工资，他们推辞不要，新翻身了的人民过意不去，硬给了每个人每天一百、二百、三百元不等。有一老自卫队员语记者：“这和那二年不同，以前是给地主受，在地里可糟蛋来，谁往头里上，就拿土疙瘩打他，谁锄的深了，就说他‘底下有银子’？现在是帮助咱们刚翻转身的人，锄的不好，心里就过意不去”。
