　　After the eleven landlords and usurers in Tianshuiling, Jincheng were liquidated, they all returned the land to the peasants according to law, but they still retained the conditions necessary for life. Of the original ninety-three poor peasant households, six rose to become rich peasants, six rose to become well-to-do middle peasants, and seventy-seven rose to become middle peasants. Only four households remained unchanged. Two hired laborers rose to become middle peasants.

　　The lives of the masses gradually improved. The days of "pillowing bricks, drying bodies, and sleeping bent over the fire" are gone forever. Now all the masses in the village wear new or semi-new clothes, and everyone has shoes to wear (in the past, many peasants had no shoes to wear, such as Guo Gelian, who often carried loads barefooted). The whole village no longer eats chaff (in the past, half of the year was spent eating chaff and vegetables). Especially during the spring plowing, all the labor force of the 132 households in the whole village were organized to carry out mutual aid. After the wheat harvest, each household harvested from 1.5 to 15 shi of wheat, and everyone had enough to eat and wear. Their ideological emotions also changed. Therefore, it became a symbol of a new type of village in the liberated area.

　　Before the wheat harvest, Comrade Zheng Siyuan of the Jincheng County Party Committee came to Tianshuiling and chatted with Guo Gelian, a hero of the emancipation. Comrade Siyuan asked, "Have you been thoroughly emancipated?" Guo replied, "I'm overflowing with emancipation!" (meaning completely turned over). Then he humorously cited the fact of "giving birth to a stone monkey at the age of fifty" to explain the reason why he was "overflowing with emancipation." He said with a smile: "I am fifty-one years old this year, and my wife is also fifty-one years old. We haven't had a child for many years, but this year we had a son. Isn't this 'giving birth to a stone monkey at the age of fifty'?"

　　Amidst everyone's laughter, Ge Lian suddenly asked seriously:

　　"Whose child do you say this is?"

　　Everyone naturally answered in unison: "Your own." Ge Lian disagreed. He solemnly said, "It's Chairman Mao's." His reason was: "Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I would have starved to death last year, so how could I have a son?" Ge Lian laughed and said, "Chairman Mao has taken root in Tianshuiling, so my son's nickname is called Zha Gen (Rooted)."

　　Then, Kong You's mother (the old lady who used a hoe to dig a hole to bury the landlord's shoes at the Dou Zheng Tongtai meeting) invited Comrade Siyuan to her home, brought out a bowl of vermicelli and a bowl of fried dough pieces, and asked her long-awaited guest to eat, saying: "This bowl of vermicelli is nothing! But it is what I dried after worshipping my ancestors during the Qingming Festival and kept until now when there is nothing to eat." Indeed, "a small gift conveys great affection." This bowl of home-cooked vegetarian dish—vermicelli—expresses a supreme and intimate emotion, reflecting the flesh-and-blood connection between the Communist Party and the people. The old lady was obviously overly excited about the arrival of her guest and asked like a child: "Can I sing you a song?" So an old lady nearly sixty years old danced and sang:

　　The autumn wind blows, the weather is getting cold, thinking of winter makes my heart break, landlords wear fur coats and sit by the fire, poor people wear rags and face the sun.

　　When noon passes, my heart is in a mess, thinking of eating is really difficult, landlords eat endless sesame oil and white flour, poor people drink half a bowl of vegetable soup until it's dry.

　　The sun sets in the west, it's getting late, thinking of sleeping is really difficult, landlords have two quilts, one mattress, and one felt, poor people spread a mat and a thin sheet.

　　When the rooster crows, it's dawn, I have to move without washing my face, landlords bask their buttocks with their hands behind their backs, poor people are covered in sweat and their clothes are wet.

　　Poor people are not poor because of fate, nor because their ancestors didn't accumulate merit, it's all because the landlords exploited us, we must unite and fight against them.

　　The Communist Party's proposal is really good, reducing rent and clearing debts has saved us, the lives of peasants have greatly improved, Chairman Mao calls for great production.

　　The old lady finished singing this self-made folk tune in one breath. A cadre asked, "The song is good, but the last sentence of the fifth paragraph is not in rhyme. Can I change the last two words 'struggle'?" The old lady immediately protested: "Don't you dare change it! How can you turn over without struggle?"

　　This is exactly what everyone said: "In the liberated areas, there are only old people, but no withered hearts!"

### 朱襄：快乐的心  群众翻身后

　　朱襄：
    快乐的心
    群众翻身后
    晋城天水岭十一户地主及高利贷者被清算以后，都依法退出了农民的土地，但都还保有生活所必须的条件。原九十三户贫农中，六户上升为富农，六户上升为富裕中农，七十七户上升为中农，只四户未动。二户雇工均上升为中农。
    群众生活逐渐改善，过去“枕砖头、晾身体、弯火睡”的日子，已一去不复返了。现全村群众都穿上新衣或半新衣，都有鞋穿（过去许多农民没鞋穿，如郭葛联经常赤脚“担山”），全村已没有吃糠的（过去是糠菜半年粮），尤其在春耕时，全村一百三十二户的所有劳力都组织起来实行互助。麦收后，每户收麦一石五斗到十五石不等，大家都有吃有穿，思想情绪也起了变化。因之成为解放区新型村庄的标帜。
    麦收前，晋城县委会郑思远同志到了天水岭，同翻身英雄郭葛联闲谈。思远同志问：“你身翻透了吗？”郭答：“翻涨了！”（翻过了的意思），接着他诙谐的举出“五十出头，生个石猴”的事实，来说明他“翻涨了”的缘由。他含笑的说：“我今年五十一岁了，我老婆也五十一岁了，好多年没生姓，偏偏今年就生了个儿，这不是‘五十出头生个石猴吗？’”
    在大家欢笑声中，葛联忽然严肃的问：
    “你说这个儿是谁的？”
    大家自然一致的答：“你自己的。”葛联可不同意，他郑重的说：“是毛主席的。”他的理由是：“没有毛主席共产党，我去年早就饿死了，那里还会生儿？”葛联大笑起来说：“毛主席在天水岭扎根了，所以我这个儿的小名便唤扎根。”
    接着孔友他娘（即斗争同泰会的大会上，用镢头刨窝埋地主鞋子的老太太），请思远同志到他家里，端出一碗粉条，一碗油炸面圪垛，请她盼望了好久的客人吃，并说：“这碗粉条不值什！但它是我清明祭祖后晒干放到现在没啥得吃的。”诚然，“礼轻仁义重”，这一碗家常素菜——粉条表达了一种无上的亲切的情感，体现了共产党与人民之间的骨肉般的联系。老太太显然为她客人的来临而过度的兴奋，孩子似的问：“我给你唱个歌好吗？”于是一个将近六十岁的老太太手舞足蹈的唱起来了：
    秋风吹来天气凉，想起过冬愁断肠，地主们身穿皮袄火边坐，穷人们身挂破衣向太阳。
    日过午时心中乱，想起吃饭实是困难，地主们香油白面吃不尽，穷人们半碗菜汤喝个干。
    日落西山天晚了，想起睡觉实是困难，地主们两床被子一褥一毡，穷人们铺张席片一卧单。
    鸡叫一声天明了，顾不得洗脸就要动弹，地主们背着两手晒屁股，穷人们满头大汗湿衣衫。
    穷人们穷来不是命穷，也不是祖上没积功，都是地主们剥削了咱，咱要团结起来和他斗争。
    共产党主张真正好，减租清债救活了咱，农民生活大改善，毛主席号召大生产。
    老太太一口气唱完了这首农民自作小调，有个干部问：“这首歌好是好，就是第五段最后一句不抑韵，我将最后‘斗争’两个字改一下好么？”老太太马上提出了抗议：“可不敢改！不斗争还能翻身？”
    这正合着大家所说的：“在解放区只有年老的人，却没有枯老的心！”
