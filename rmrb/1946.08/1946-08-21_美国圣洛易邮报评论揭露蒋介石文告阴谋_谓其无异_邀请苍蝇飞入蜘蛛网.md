Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. Washington, 16th (US News Service dispatch): The St. Louis Post-Dispatch commented on Chiang Kai-shek's proclamation on the anniversary of the victory over Japan on the 15th, stating: "As far as the Chinese Communists are concerned, Chairman Chiang's proclamation is no different from 'inviting flies into a spider's web.'" The newspaper stated: "Chairman Chiang's proclamation is actually not directed at the Chinese Communists, but at the United States, hoping to blame the Chinese Communists and thereby continue to obtain financial and military support from the U.S. government." The newspaper stated: "If the Communists accept Chairman Chiang's proposal and lay down their arms, the consequences are imaginable, for this gentleman (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) has been waiting for nearly * years, intending to take advantage of their unpreparedness to eliminate them."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. According to various reports, after Chiang Kai-shek issued a proclamation on the eve of the anniversary of Japan's surrender, he will soon convene widespread meetings to mobilize for civil war. The Shanghai Youth Party's "China Times" once suggested that Chiang Kai-shek convene a "Lushan Talk Conference." Zhu Jiahua, the CC special agent head and Minister of Education, admitted in a written conversation in Gu Ling on the 16th that Chiang Kai-shek would summon university presidents and professors from across the country to go up the mountain to "inquire about everything." According to the Associated Press, citing a report from the Nanjing Xinmin Daily, the meeting will be held on August 25th to "discuss ways to resolve China's internal strife." It is widely rumored in Nanjing and Shanghai that before Chiang Kai-shek issued the civil war proclamation, he ordered various localities to hold "current affairs seminars" to absorb respected local figures to participate, with the clear intention of creating public opinion for the civil war.

　　美国圣洛易邮报评论揭露蒋介石文告阴谋
    谓其无异“邀请苍蝇飞入蜘蛛网”
    【新华社延安十八日电】美新闻处华盛顿十六日电：圣洛易邮报十五日评论蒋介石对日胜利纪念日之文告，全称：“就其对中共而言，蒋主席之文告无异‘邀请苍蝇飞入蜘蛛网’。该报称：‘蒋主席之文告，实际上并非对中共而发，而为对美国而发，希望归罪于中共，而借此继续获得美国政府财政上与军事上之支援。’该报称：‘共产党如果接受蒋主席的建议而放下武器，其后果可想而知，盖此公（按指蒋介石）等候几达×年之久，拟乘其无备而加以消灭之。”
    【新华社延安十七日电】据各方报导，蒋介石于日本投降周年纪念日前夕发表文告后，即将普遍召开内战动员会议。沪青年党《中华时报》曾建议蒋介石召开“庐山谈话会”，ＣＣ特务头子教育部长朱家骅于十六日在牯书面谈话，承认蒋介石将召见全国各大学校长教授上山“垂询一切”。据美联社引南京新民报报导，是项会谈将于八月二十五日举行，“商讨解决中国内争的办法”。京沪各地盛传蒋介石于发表内战文告之前，曾令各地举行“时事座谈会”，吸收当地有威望人士参加，其意显系作内战舆论动员。
