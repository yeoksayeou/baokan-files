　　The People of Anyang Under Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Oppression
    Han Hua
    Of the 700,000 people in Anyang, half of the vast population, excluding the liberated areas, are still struggling under the Kuomintang's tyranny. In the eastern and northeastern parts of Anyang, covering an area of approximately 2,200 square miles, the puppet army of Wang Ziquan and Cheng Daosheng, two bandit and traitor leaders whom the people have long hated to the bone, are entrenched. The Kuomintang uses them to carry out疯狂extortion and barbaric suppression of the people.

    The three stubborn puppet strongholds—Anyang City, Cuijiaqiao, and Cheng Taibao—gather thousands upon thousands of peasants every day. They abandon their fields and spend their days building houses and fortifications for the stubborn puppets. The puppet army leader Cheng Daosheng, in order to build his private residence, forcibly requisitions from each bao a large beam of 24 feet in length, as well as a large amount of wood, bricks, and stones, to build a magnificent courtyard and a palatial building in Taibao Village. He also dug five large circular pits, each about ten feet deep and covering an area of one mu, with wheat straw padded around the pits and at the bottom. He then filled them with wheat forcibly requisitioned from various villages, which was transported by carts and carried on shoulders. Three pits are already full and piled more than ten feet above the ground. It is said that more than ten thousand dan of wheat have already been delivered, and the carts continuously transporting wheat to Taibao are still increasing!

    Another puppet army leader, Wang Ziquan, in order to defend his old lair—Cuijiaqiao, which he has occupied for more than ten years, still feels that the earth stronghold, blockhouses, moats, and electric fences built with the people's blood and sweat are not secure enough. Therefore, starting in late June, he began to conscript laborers to widen the original earth stronghold by five feet and to cover the entire寨wall with two layers of wooden planks, so that even if炮弹 landed on the寨wall, it would not harm anyone. He wants to turn Cuijiaqiao into an eternal魔窟.

    Anyang City and Weishang Village (Yuanzhai), where the 40th Army is stationed, have been digging ditches since the beginning of June. They dug环城blockade ditches and城河. They don't care if there is a drought that prevents sowing or if the land is荒废and cannot be hoed. They ordered each bao to provide 100 laborers every day. If one person is missing, they will be fined 6,000 yuan. Many places have already dug water up to their knees, but it is still not considered complete, and they declared that the work would not stop until August 15th (Mid-Autumn Festival).

    Thousands upon thousands of peasant masses are working tirelessly under the scorching sun. The sweat on their heads flows into the mud at their feet, and everyone is drenched as if they had just taken a bath.

    Every three or four feet away, there is a supervisor holding a wooden stick, smoking洋烟, and wearing a military uniform. He constantly yells: "Damn it, work faster! Work faster!"

    In addition to manual labor, livestock and vehicles are also constantly being requisitioned.

    "Exemption from one year of grain tax and suspension of one year of military service" have all been clearly stipulated by the National Government. However, in the face of the people of Anyang, it is just like Chiang Kai-shek's four promises, not only slapping himself in the face but also doubling the endless levy. The puppet troops of Wang and Cheng can directly levy grain and demand money without going through the government or local乡公所, and they can ask for whatever amount they want, and no one dares to bargain.

    From the first month of the lunar calendar to half a year after the wheat harvest, puppet army leader Cheng Daosheng has collected rice, wheat, firewood, money, bran, etc., equivalent to five dou of wheat per mu. The masses are impoverished in the spring when the new crops are not yet ripe. Nine out of ten families are empty. Selling庄田 is useless. The官兵 urge payment like wildfire, so they have to borrow money publicly in the village. For every shi of wheat borrowed, one shi and five dou (five dou of interest) must be repaid after the wheat harvest. They hope to repay the principal and interest after a good harvest in May, but who knew that the harvest in May was only 50%. The highest yield per mu was six dou, and the lowest was two dou, but the levy by the stubborn puppet troops became even more outrageous. As of June, Fengsu and Lücun had already collected the equivalent of eight dou and five sheng of wheat per mu (including interest), and Pangjiawan and Qicun seven dou. An old man from ×× village told me哭着: "I planted sixty mu of land and harvested eight shi of wheat, and selling two mules to pay the burden was not enough. My family of four had nothing to eat just after May." Finally, in a懇乞tone, he said to me: "I don't know if I can go to the west (referring to the liberated area)? I really plan to sell the materials and waterwheels in my house and move to the Shuiye area in Fuxi." There are too many people with the same fate as this old man. The vast peasant masses really cannot live on, and they are brewing "letting the land and leaving their hometowns."

    In the area of puppet army Wang Ziquan, this spring, every dingyang (equivalent to six mu of land) has already paid 145 jin of fine grain (rice and wheat), two jin of cotton, two jin of pig iron, a pair of shoes, more than 2,000 jin of firewood, and bran, etc. After May (after the wheat harvest), every dingyang paid another 360 jin of wheat. In late June, every 100 yuan of dingyang was conscripted for one soldier. Generally, villages pay from one million to 1.4 million yuan to buy a壮丁, and after signing a contract guaranteeing that they will not desert, they send them off. The cost of buying soldiers alone is another 10,000 yuan or tens of thousands of yuan per dingyang. According to the settlement of general villages for half a year, the burden per mu is more than five dou (23 jin per dou) of wheat (including stubborn puppet burden). I met a farmer named Li in Guocun who sighed and said: "Alas! This year,命is required in any case."

    Since Japan surrendered last year, the people of Anyang, like other regions of the country, celebrated the victory of the anti-Japanese war with狂欢 and thought that they could be free from the bloody rule of traitors and puppets for the past eight years. People waited with wide eyes to see the execution of the traitorous heads—Li Ying, Wang Ziquan, and Cheng Daosheng—who recognized thieves as their fathers. Who knew that after the victory, these extremely sinful puppet army heads would not only not be executed in front of the people but would instead become the darlings of today's Kuomintang reactionaries. Thus, Anyang's traitorous group and the Kuomintang's powerful figures, Zhao Zhichen (专员), Yao Anzhi (县长), and Sun Ziqing (党部书记长), became even closer and launched a two-pronged attack on the people.

    In the rural areas of the stubborn puppet region, no matter which corner you go to, you can see soldiers holding clubs in groups of three or five, or small armed forces in班s and排s. Sometimes, there are as many as five or six units simultaneously催粮款or firewood in one village. They are like wild beasts that eat people, chasing after the保长 to collect them in the streets. If they speak improperly or are slow to get the money, the wet willow sticks will be狠狠ly added to them. Often, many villages cannot find a man. Four grain-collecting soldiers under the puppet Cheng Daosheng, while beating people in Pangjiawan in mid-June, shouted: "This is the order of Commissioner Zhao. Beating is the consequence of taking the payment slowly"! A platoon leader under the puppet Wang Ziquan led more than a dozen armed soldiers and went to Xiyangdian to collect grain. The 甲长, Sun Yuming,懇乞ed the platoon leader, saying: "If you ask for more, you will force the people to death." One sentence angered the platoon leader's dignity. With a shout, the soldiers knocked Sun Yuming to the ground, and five or six wet willow sticks扑嗤, 扑嗤! Instantly, he was beaten until he was covered in blood and unconscious. After being carried home, he died in a few days. This matter spread throughout the area, and the保甲长 in various villages were惶恐不安 as soon as they heard: "The grain-collecting soldiers are here"! The 保长 of Baode and four or five other villages fled for their lives because of this.

    In short, the people of Anyang, groaning under the iron fist of Chiang Kai-shek's puppets, can no longer live on. They are calling for救命!

　　蒋伪奴役下的安阳人民
    韩华
    安阳七十万人口中，除解放区以外，尚有二分之一的广大人民，正在国民党暴政下喘息着。在安阳的东部和东北部，面积约两千二百余方里的地面上，盘踞着伪军王自全和程道生两个人民早已恨之入骨的土匪汉奸头子，国民党通过他们对人民进行疯狂的榨取与野蛮的镇压。
    三个顽伪大据点——安阳城、崔家桥、和程太保，每天都集结着成千成万的农民。他们荒废了自己的田园，整日替顽伪修房造屋建筑工事。伪军头子程道生，为了建筑私人的住宅，每保强征两丈四尺长的大梁一根，及大量的木料砖石等物，要在太保寨内盖一所华丽的庭院，堂皇的大楼。并挖了五个深约一丈，面积一亩的圆形大土坑，土坑的周围及坑底垫上麦糠，装进大小车辆推推挑挑从各村暴征的麦子，现有三个坑已经装满，并堆出地面一丈多高。据说：已送到的麦子，已有一万几千石了，而且连续不绝向太保送麦的车辆还正多着呢！
    另一伪军头子王自全为了坚守盘踞十年以上的老窝——崔家桥，除了已经为人民血汗所筑成的土寨、炮楼、寨壕、电网外，还嫌不大保险，所以从六月下旬开始，便又征集民夫将原来的土寨，再向外加修五尺宽，并将整个寨墙用木板棚作两层，使炮弹落到寨墙上也不会伤人，要想把崔家桥变成万世魔窟。
    安阳城以及四十军驻守的渭上村（袁宅）等据点，从六月初开始，便一直没有停止挖沟，挖了环城封锁沟又挖城河，他们那管你天旱不能下种，地荒不能锄刨，下令每保每日出夫一百名，少了一名罚洋六千元。许多地方已经挖出膝盖深的水，还不能算完，并且他们声言：到八月十五（中秋节）也不能停工。
    成千累万的农民群众，在酷热的烈日下无休息的劳作，头上的汗流到脚下的泥水里，个个都是湿淋淋的好似刚洗过澡一样。
    每隔三四丈远的距离，便有一个手提木棍，口衔洋烟身穿着军服的监工，他不时吆喝着：“他妈的，快干！快干！”
    除了人工劳役外，牲口车辆，也整年不停的支差。
    “免征一年粮赋，停止一年兵役”，都经过国民政府的明令规定，可是它在安阳人民面前也和蒋介石的四项诺言一样，不仅是自己打自己的嘴巴，而且是加倍的无止境的征收，王、程两部的伪军可以不经过政府及地方乡公所，就直接摊粮要款，而且说多少就是多少，谁也不敢还价钱。
    伪军程道生，从旧历正月至麦后半年为止，所征米、麦、烧柴、款项、麸料等，每亩折合小麦五斗，群众在春天青黄不接之时，十室九空，变卖庄田无有受主，而官兵催款又如星火，便只有经村中公伙揭债，每批（揭债）麦一石到麦收后即还一石五斗（利息五斗），指望着五月丰收以后偿还本利，岂知五月的收成只有五成，每亩收额，最高六斗、低者二斗，而且顽伪军的征收却更变本加厉，截至六月份为止冯宿、吕村每亩已合小麦八斗五升（利息在内），庞家湾、奇村七斗，××村一个老汉哭着告诉我说：“我种着六十亩地，打了八石麦子，卖了两个骡子填到负担里还不够，全家四口人刚过了五月就没啥吃。”最后以恳乞的态度向我说：“西边（指解放区）不知能去不能？我真打算把家里的物料、水车卖掉，搬到府西水冶一带去住。”像这老汉一样命运的人实在太多了，广大的农民群众确已不能生活下去，他们正酝酿着“让地离乡”。
    伪军王自全地区，今春每丁洋（合地六亩）已出细粮（米麦）一百四十五斤，棉花二斤，生铁二斤，鞋一双，烧柴两千余斤以及麸草等，五月后（麦后）又每丁洋出小麦三百六十斤，六月下旬每一百元丁洋征兵一个，一般村子都是以百万至一百四十万元买一个壮丁，并经过立约担保（保证不开小差）送去的。单买兵费每丁洋即又摊一万元或一万几千元，据一般村子半年的结算，每亩负担均在五斗（每斗二十三斤）小麦以上（顽伪负担均在内）。我曾遇到郭村一个姓李的农民长叹了一口气对我说：“唉！这年头横竖是要命”。
    自去年日本投降以后，安阳人民也和全国其他地区一样：在狂欢的颂扬抗战胜利，以为从此便可以解脱八年来奸伪的血腥统治，人们张大了双眼等待着看看认贼作父的汉奸头子——李英、王自全、程道生的伏法，岂知胜利了，这些罪大恶极的伪军头子，非但不能在人民面前伏法，反而却成为今天国民党反动派的宠儿，于是安阳的汉奸集团和国民党的当权者赵质宸（专员）、姚安之（县长）、孙子青（党部书记长）却益形亲密起来，双管齐下的向人民进攻了。
    在顽伪区的农村，不管你走到那一个角落，都可以看见三五成群，手持棍棒的军人，或成班成排的小型武装。有时一个村同时坐催粮款或烧柴的军人，竟有五六个单位之多。他们都像吃人的野兽一样，追迫着保长绕街催讨，一时说话不当或拿款迟慢，湿柳棍便会狠狠的加到他们身上，往往打得许多村竟找不到一个男人。伪程道生部下四个催粮兵，六月中的一日在庞家湾打人时，还高喊着：“这是赵专员的命令，拿款慢了就是打”！伪王自全部下的一个排长带领了十几个武装士兵，在西羊店催粮时，甲长孙玉明以求乞的态度向该排长说：“再要就把老百姓都逼死了”。一句话触怒了排长的尊严，一声吆喝：士兵们便将孙玉明放倒在地，五六条湿柳棍扑嗤，扑嗤！顿时打的鲜血淋漓不省人事，后经抬至家中，数日即死。此事传遍了各地，各村保甲长一听说：“来了催粮兵”！便都惶恐不安。鲍德等四五个村的保长，便都因此外出逃命。
    总之，呻吟在蒋伪铁缔下的安阳人民，已经不能生活下去，他们在呼唤救命！
