Taihang Mobilizes the Entire Region's Military and Civilians
Resolutely Implement the Central Bureau's Call
Wu'an Decides to Continue Implementing Mass Movement to Support the Front Lines

[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] After seeing the Liberation Daily's urgent mobilization editorial and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau's call, the responsible comrades of the Taihang Party, government, military, and civilian leading organs immediately gathered at the district party committee's offices on the 22nd to discuss and decided to mobilize all the military and civilians in the Taihang region with the utmost speed, turn indignation into action, and resolutely implement the Central Bureau's urgent call. Subsequently, they conducted in-depth inspections and new arrangements for work in the areas of troops, finance and economy, the emancipation movement, production and thrift, and culture, putting forward the slogan of "everything for the victory of the front line." It was decided to first carry out a major ideological mobilization, immediately notify all special districts, counties, and troops to discuss the Liberation Daily editorial and the Central Bureau's call. On the 24th, a cadre conference was held for all agencies at the administrative office level, with Political Commissar Li Xuefeng and Director Li Yiqing personally mobilizing.

[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] In response to the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau's call to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and strive for victory in the patriotic war, and to implement the mass emancipation movement, the Wu'an County Government, Bank, Public Security Bureau, Post Office and other agencies convened a cadre mobilization meeting on the 19th to prepare to dispatch a large number of cadres to the countryside to help deepen the mass movement. At the meeting, County Chief Cheng proposed that launching the masses with a free hand is a powerful guarantee for winning the patriotic war, and every cadre should resolutely eliminate landlord sentiments and the incorrect understanding of fearing "excesses." Any thoughts, emotions, and actions that hinder the mass movement will cause immense losses to the work. He called on all cadres to give full play to their high work efficiency, take time out, and participate in the mass movement in the urban areas. He also called on cadres from landlord families to respond to the call of the Taihang District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, mobilize their families to launch a land donation movement, seize the time, continue to implement the mass movement, and prepare to support the front lines. The emancipation teams participating in the mass movement in the urban areas have already begun their work actively. (Yi Fan)

[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The newly emancipated people of the Third District of Wu'an are doing their utmost to strengthen their self-defense armed forces in order to repel enemy invasions and protect their hard-won interests. After 270 capable militiamen joined the People's Liberation Army, young people successively poured into the militia. According to incomplete statistics, there are already more than 700 people. Farmers bought guns and weapons for the militia with a large number of struggle gains. Daluoyuan bought eight rifles and two pistols at once, Tonghui bought a machine gun, and Boyan bought twenty-six rifles, two machine guns, and two hand cannons. Most of the militiamen practice shooting and throwing grenades during the tense production gaps, preparing for self-defense operations. The Boyan militia has gone to the front line to participate in the war. At the time of departure, they vowed to the villagers: We will definitely win glory for our village, not desert, and also exchange for good rifles. (Shi Hong)
