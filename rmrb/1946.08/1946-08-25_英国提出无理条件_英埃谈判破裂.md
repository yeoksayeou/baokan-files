　　British-Egyptian Talks Break Down
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] According to news agency reports: British-Egyptian talks broke down on the 20th, and the Egyptian delegation has rejected Britain's final plan. The Associated Press stated that the main points of disagreement were: (1) The time limit for British troops to withdraw from Egypt. Egypt believes that one year is sufficient, while Britain sets it at three years. (2) The issue of the British-Egyptian alliance. Egypt believes that it should only assist Britain if Britain is attacked, while Britain requires Egypt to assist Britain when Middle Eastern countries are attacked. (3) The Sudan issue. Egypt demands that Sudan merge with Egypt, while Britain wants to maintain the Anglo-Egyptian condominium. According to Reuters: Sidky is making a final effort to salvage the deadlock. When asked by reporters on the 20th, Sidky said: "The Egyptian side's decision is not final." Sidky's newspaper stated on the evening of the 20th: "The door to negotiations has not yet been closed."

　　英国提出无理条件
　　英埃谈判破裂
    【新华社延安二十二电】据各通讯社报导：英埃谈判于二十日宣告破裂，埃及代表团已拒绝了英国的最后计划。合众社谓主要分歧点为：（一）英军自埃及撤退的时限问题。埃及认为一年足够，英国则定为三年。（二）英埃同盟问题。埃及认为唯有英国被攻，才援助英国，而英国则要求在中东国家遭受攻击时，埃及即须援英。（三）苏丹问题。埃及要求苏丹与埃及合并，而英国则欲保持英埃共管。据路透社称：席德基正作最后努力，以图挽救僵局。二十日席氏回答记者时称：埃及方面的决定尚非最后的。席德基的机关报二十日晚称：“谈判之门仍未关闭”。
