Who is Destroying Transportation in North China?

The third article of the January 10th Ceasefire Order stipulates: "Actions that damage and obstruct all transportation lines must cease, and all obstacles obstructing these transportation lines should be immediately removed." The so-called obstacles here primarily refer to pillboxes (碉堡). Regarding the leveling of pillboxes, the No. 4 Order of Reconciliation, issued by the Peiping (Beiping) Executive Headquarters on February 21st, contained even clearer regulations. This order was signed not only by the three members of the Executive Headquarters but also by General Zhou Enlai, General Zhang Zhizhong, and Marshal George Marshall of the Chongqing Three-Person Conference. Order No. 4 of Reconciliation requires "the immediate removal and demolition of all landmines, pillboxes, and fortifications along transportation lines, and the cancellation and prohibition of compulsory inspections, illegal and unreasonable damage to people's travel, cargo transportation, and postal and telegraph services." However, Chiang Kai-shek neither changed the compulsory inspections and illegal and unreasonable damage to travel, transportation, postal and telegraph services, nor did he level pillboxes and other blockade fortifications. The pillbox policy was already extensively used by the Kuomintang army during the ten-year civil war from 1927 to 1937 as strongholds for military offensives and to blockade and cut off transportation to the then Red Army. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders learned from the Kuomintang army's old tricks and built even more pillboxes. After Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang army retained the Japanese pillboxes and added many new ones. Therefore, all major transportation routes around the Liberated Areas, wherever the Japanese and Kuomintang armies had passed, were riddled with pillboxes. Since the issuance of the Ceasefire Order, the release of Order No. 4 of Reconciliation was achieved through the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party. Subsequently, the Executive Headquarters dispatched transportation teams to supervise the implementation of this order along various railway lines. However, due to the Kuomintang's fundamental lack of sincerity in compliance, this order remains a dead letter to this day. The fundamental reason for the failure to restore transportation in North China is naturally the Kuomintang's insistence on civil war, but one of the direct causes is also the Kuomintang's preservation and expansion of a large number of pillboxes on various transportation lines for the purpose of civil war. The Kuomintang deliberately misinterpreted the content of Order No. 4 of Reconciliation, saying that "the pillboxes referred to in the order to be demolished are only those built on the railway lines, and not generally those on the side of the transportation lines or general pillboxes," and that "the pillboxes that must be demolished are specifically those that 'hinder' transportation, and those that do not hinder transportation and have the effect of protecting transportation are exceptions," and also said that "demolishing pillboxes is a secondary issue, and repairing railways is the top priority," and finally simply said "pillboxes are national defense fortifications and cannot be demolished," and "demolishing pillboxes only refers to the CCP-controlled areas and not the Kuomintang-controlled areas," etc., using this as an excuse to refuse demolition "and attempting to have the CCP unilaterally comply with the order (in fact, there are no pillboxes to demolish in the Liberated Areas), while they remain at large." This attitude of the Kuomintang is not surprising. As early as after the issuance of the Ceasefire Order, their highest authorities secretly ordered the war zones to actively build pillbox fortifications, stating: "Important points north of the Yangtze River, including Peiping, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Liaozhong, Tieling, Cangzhou, Baoding, Qingdao, Jiaozhou, Southern Hebei, Xuzhou, Haimen, Shijiazhuang, Nantong, etc., as well as the major railway lines in North China—the Tianjin-Cangzhou section of the Jinpu Railway, the Xuzhou-Pukou section, the Peiping-Yuanshi section of the Pinghan Railway, the Xinyang-Xinxiang section, the Datong-Taiyuan section of the Tongpu Railway, and the Xuzhou-Kaifeng section of the Longhai Railway—should immediately construct pillbox fortifications, to be completed by the end of April this year, and store enough food and ammunition for two months in each important point." In addition, according to the CCP's seizure of the No. 26706 telegram from the Eleventh War Zone on February 8th, relayed by Chiang Kai-shek, "Unnecessary pillbox fortifications in various places can be decided by the commanders of each war zone to be built or demolished, but the pillbox fortifications along the railway lines cannot be demolished." The Kuomintang's firm refusal to demolish pillboxes can also be fully demonstrated by the following example: In March, the CCP in the Gaomi team proposed that the Kuomintang demolish pillboxes within 300 meters on both sides of the railway. They disagreed, openly saying, "Following Chairman Chiang's order, pillboxes are not allowed to be demolished." The CCP retreated a step, only asking them to demolish pillboxes along the railway line within 100 meters. They still refused. Finally, the CCP even asked them to demolish a portion at random to show sincerity. When implementing the order, the other party still insisted on not demolishing.

Secondly, the large-scale expansion of new pillboxes further undermined the order to restore transportation. According to incomplete statistics from the short three months from the issuance of the order to May, the number of newly built pillboxes is:

(1) The Tongpu Railway originally had 2,066 pillboxes, with 491 newly built in violation of the order, totaling 2,597. The number of new constructions accounted for 19% of the original number of pillboxes. The center of construction was along the railway line in the southern Shanxi triangle area and between Datong and Taiyuan (there are 1,250 new and old pillboxes between Datong and Taiyuan, one every mile). The Tongpu Railway was the earliest to build pillboxes, and its "achievements are particularly great."

(2) The Pinghan Railway originally had 904, with 120 newly built, totaling 1,024. The new construction accounted for 12% of the existing pillboxes. The center was in the Anyang-Xinxiang section (96 pillboxes in 210 miles) and the Queshan-Xiaogan section, with the aim of isolating the connection between the east and west sides of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army. In addition, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Xincheng were also the focus of their pillbox construction. In Shijiazhuang, new pillboxes were built in all important city streets and entertainment venues, one every five steps. There are four blockade lines in the suburbs, connected by communication trenches, and the trenches are densely covered with booby traps. There are 610 in total.

(3) The Jinpu Railway originally had 457, with 168 newly built, totaling 625. The new construction accounted for 27% of the existing pillboxes. The center was in the Xuzhou-Pukou section (190 on both sides of the line between Xuzhou and Suxian, five every two miles from Suxian to Caocun). The connection between Huaibei and Subei and between Huainan and Subei has now been cut off. The areas around Cangzhou, Jinan, Yanzhou, and Lincheng are also the focus of their pillbox construction. In Lincheng, Chen Daqing ordered his subordinates to cut down more than a hundred trees and demolish more than twenty civilian houses to build pillboxes. There are now 230 new and old ones, with an average of one pillbox every 0.4 miles on the entire line.

(4) The Jiaoji Railway originally had 88, with 48 newly built, totaling 136. The new construction accounted for 35% of the existing pillboxes. The focus was around Gaomi, in addition to the railway line, they occupied our villages and towns on both sides. There are 83 from Qingdao to Weixian, and it is planned to build one every mile. Ditches more than a zhang deep and wide were dug on the side of the road, and wire mesh was set up. There is an average of one every 1.2 miles on the entire line.

(5) The Daoqing Railway originally had 127, with 122 newly built, totaling 247, accounting for 47% of the existing pillboxes. The focus was around Xiuwu, with an average of one every 1.2 miles.

(6) The Zhengtai Railway originally had 183, with 25 newly built, totaling 208, accounting for 12% of the original number. There are 120 new and old ones from Niangziguan to Yangquan, an average of one every 1.4 miles.

(7) The Baijin Railway originally had 81, with 12 newly built, totaling 93, accounting for 13% of the existing pillboxes. There is an average of one every 1.1 miles. Since there were already many old pillboxes on this line, there was no need for major expansion.

(8) The Beining Railway originally had 32, with 13 newly built, totaling 45, accounting for 29% of the existing pillboxes. Most of this line is guarded by the U.S. military, so there is no need to build many pillboxes.

(9) The Pingsui Railway originally had 27, with 30 newly built, totaling 57, accounting for 52% of the existing pillboxes. The focus was on the Nankou-Qinglongqiao section and the Qixiaying-Taobuqi section, which greatly threatened our Zhangjiakou.

(10) The Beikou Railway originally had 5, with 5 newly built, totaling 10, accounting for 50% of the existing pillboxes. The center was along the line between Shunyi and Miyun. There were fewer pillboxes built because it was very close to the Peiping Executive Headquarters, for fear of criticism.

The total number of pillboxes on all railway lines was originally 3,880, with 1,032 newly built, totaling 4,912. The construction time was 104 before February, the most in March, reaching 558, and 370 in April, less than in March, because the pillbox construction plan had been largely completed. The Kuomintang's highest authorities ordered completion by the end of April (an average of 344 pillboxes were built per month, more than eight times faster than the Japanese invaders. The Japanese invaders began building pillboxes in 1939, averaging only 46 per month). In addition to building new pillboxes, the Kuomintang army also renovated many old pillboxes. For example, in the Xinxiang area, several layers were added to the one-story pillboxes built by the enemy for the purpose of expanding the civil war. This is also where they are "bluer than blue." During the Nanjing negotiations in early June, CCP representative Zhou Enlai and Kuomintang Minister of Communications Yu Dajun reached an agreement on the issue of restoring transportation. However, due to the Kuomintang's unreasonable demand that our army withdraw from Subei, Rehe, and other places, and insisting that other issues would not be resolved until this issue was resolved, the talks on restoring transportation failed to yield any results.

### 是谁破坏华北交通？

　　是谁破坏华北交通？
    本年一月十日停战令第三条规定：“破坏与阻碍一切交通线之行动必须停止，所有阻碍该项交通线之障碍物应即撤除”，这里所谓障碍物，首先就是碉堡。关于碉堡的平毁，在二月二十一日北平执行部发布的和字第四号命令中曾有更明确的规定，这个命令除由执行部三委员署名外，还有重庆三人会议周恩来将军、张治中将军、马歇尔元帅的签名。和字第四号命令要求“立即撤去和平毁沿交通线之一切地雷、碉堡以及防御工事，取消及禁止对人民旅行货物转运及邮件电报之强制检查非法无理损害行为，但是蒋介石既没有改变对旅行、运输、邮电等的强制检查和非法无理损害，也没有平毁碉堡和其他封锁工事。碉堡政策在一九二七年至一九三七年的十年内战时期，蒋军即已大量使用作为对当时红军军事进攻的据点和封锁断绝交通之用。抗战时期，日寇学习蒋军的故智，更大量筑碉堡，日本投降后，蒋军保留了日寇的碉堡，而且添作了很多新的，因此解放区周围的一切交通要道只要是日军蒋军曾经经过之处，都是碉堡林立。自停战令颁布后，在中共力争下始得有和字第四号命令的发布，以后执行部虽曾派遣交通小组到各铁路沿线监督该项命令的执行，但由于蒋方根本无诚意遵守，致使该项命令至今等于空文。华北交通的不能恢复根本上自然由于蒋方的坚持内战，而其直接原因之一还由于蒋方为了内战的目的在各交通线保存和增筑巨量碉堡。蒋方故意曲解和字第四号命令的内容，说什么“命令中所指平毁之碉堡系仅指筑于铁路线上者言，而不是泛指交通线侧或一般碉堡”，“须拆毁之碉堡系专指‘妨害’交通者，其不妨害交通且有保护交通之作用者例外”，又说“拆碉堡是次要问题，修复铁路才是当务之急”，最后干脆说“碉堡是国防工事，不能拆毁”，“拆碉仅指中共控制区而不指国方控制区”等等，以此作为他们拒拆之借口“并企图要中共单方遵守命令（其实解放区根本无碉堡可拆），而他们则逍遥法外。蒋方这种态度并不奇怪，早在停战命令发布后，他们的最高当局曾密令各战区绥署积极修筑碉堡工事内称：“长江以北北平、天津、秦皇岛、辽中、铁岭、沧州、保定、青岛、胶州、冀南、徐州、海门、石庄、南通等要点以及华北各铁路线——津浦路天津沧州段、徐州浦口段、平汉路北平元氏段、信阳新乡段、同蒲路大同太原段、陇海路徐州开封段各要线，应即修碉堡工事，限于本年四月底完工，并在各要点中储足两个月粮弹。”另外据中共缴获第十一战区二月八日转蒋介石所发渝字第二六七○六号代电称：“各地无必要之碉堡工事可由各战区长官自行决定修建或平毁，但铁路沿线的碉堡工事不可拆除。”蒋方坚决不拆碉堡的顽固态度，还可从下面的例子充分表明：三月间，高密小组中共提出要蒋方拆除铁路两侧三百公尺内碉堡，他们不同意，公然说“奉蒋委员长命令不准拆碉”。中共退一步只要他们拆除一百公尺内铁路沿线碉堡，他们依然不答应，最后中共甚至只要其随便拆毁一部份，借表诚意，执行命令时对方仍坚持不拆的主张。
    其次是大肆扩建新碉，这就更进一步破坏了恢复交通命令。据自该项命令发布后至五月份短短三个月中不完全统计，其新建碉堡的数目是：
    （１）同蒲路原有碉堡二○六六个，违令新建四九一个，共有二五九七个，新建数占原有碉数比例百分之十九，其筑碉的中心在晋南三角地带的铁路沿线及大同太原间（大同太原间新旧碉堡共有一二五○个，每里一个），全线平均一·六里有一个。按同蒲路筑碉时间最早，“成绩亦特大”。
    （２）平汉路原有九○四个，新建一二○个，共有一○二四个，新建占现有碉数百分之十二，其中心在安阳新乡段（全线二一○里间有碉九六个）及确山孝感段，其目的在隔断新四军五师路东西之联系。另外石庄、保定、新城亦为其筑碉重点，在石庄各重要市街娱乐场所均筑有新碉，每隔五步耸立一个，市郊有四道封锁线，有交通沟相连，沿封锁线密布子母雷，沟内并有暗碉，计共有六一○个。
    （３）津浦路原有四五七个，新建一六八个，共有六二五个，新建占现碉数百分之二十七，其中心在徐州浦口段（徐州到宿县间沿线两侧有一九○个，宿县至曹村每二里五个）现已将我们淮北苏北间淮南苏中间的联系打断。沧州、济南、兖州、临城诸点周围，亦为其筑碉重点。在临城，陈大庆手令所属砍伐树木百余株，拆毁民房二十余间，用以修碉，现新旧已有二三○个，全线平均○·四里筑碉一座。
    （４）胶济线原有八八个，新建四八个，共一三六个，新建占现碉数百分之三十五，重心在高密四周，除在铁路线外，即在两侧占我之村镇。青岛至潍县有八三个，计划每里修一个，路侧挖沟深宽各丈余，并设有铁丝网，全线平均一·二里有一个。
    （５）道清路原有一二七个，新建一二二个，共二四七个，占现碉数比例达百分之四十七，重点在修武周围，平均一·二里有一个。
    （６）正太路原有一八三座，新建二五座，共二○八座，占原数百分之十二。娘子关到阳泉，新旧共有一二○个，平均一·四里有一座。
    （７）白晋路原有八一座，新建一二座，共九三座，占现碉数百分之十三，平均一·一里有一个，因该线旧碉已不少，故不须大事扩修。
    （８）北宁路原有三二，新建一三，共四五，占现碉数百分之二十九，该线大部为美军守备，无须多修碉堡。
    （９）平绥路原有二七，新建三○，共五七，占现碉数百分之五十二，重点在南口青龙桥段，及旗下营陶卜齐段，威胁我张家口甚大。
    （１０）北口路原有五，新建五，共十个，占现碉数百分之五十，重心在顺义密云间沿线筑碉较少，因离北平执行部很近，恐费口实。
    各条铁路总计原有碉堡三八八○个，新建一○三二个，共四九一二个，其修建时间，二月前为一○四个，三月份最多，达五五八个，四月份三七○个，较三月份少，因为筑碉的计划已经大体完成了。蒋方最高当局命令限四月底完成（平均每月建碉三四四座，较日寇快八倍之多。日寇自一九三九年回师敌后开始建碉，平均每月只建四十六座），蒋军除新建碉堡外，还改造了许多旧碉堡，如在新乡一带，在敌人所建的一层碉堡上，再筑几层，以为扩大内战之用，这也是“青胜于蓝”的地方。在六月上旬南京谈判时，中共代表周恩来与国民党交通部长俞大钧，曾对恢复交通问题达成协议，但由于蒋方无理要求我军退出苏北热河等地，并坚持这一问题不解决，其他问题都不解决，致使恢复交通的会谈无法得到任何结果。（延安新华社）
