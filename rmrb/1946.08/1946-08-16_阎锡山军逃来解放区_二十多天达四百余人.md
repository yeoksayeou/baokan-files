Yan Xishan's Troops Flee to Liberated Areas
    Over 400 in Twenty-Odd Days
    [Our paper, Yangcheng, 11th] Yan army soldiers, unwilling to fight in the civil war, are now deserting in large numbers. At the beginning of last month, Yan Xishan once again issued a "handwritten order" to his subordinates, saying: "The desertion of our officers and soldiers is the greatest disgrace to our cadres at all levels and the root of our troops' demise. The number of recent desertions is truly alarming." On July 9th, over 20 soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment, 44th Division of the Yan army stationed in Dayin, Huo County, fled to our liberated area overnight. On July 14th, four scouts from the 1st Battalion, 205th Regiment of the Yan army stationed in Xiaohuma, Zhaocheng, defected to us while out on reconnaissance. In July, of the conscripts forcibly drafted by Yan Xishan in the areas of Shicun, Zhaoqu, and Zhangli in Xiangling, 240 had fled to our liberated area by the end of the month. Besides some returning home, some also joined the local people's self-defense struggle to protect their homes. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in the twenty-odd days from June 16th to July 14th, over 400 Yan army soldiers fled to our liberated area. The phenomenon of desertion in the Yan army is increasing daily.

　　阎锡山军逃来解放区
    二十多天达四百余人
    【本报阳城十一日电】不愿内战的阎军士兵，现正大批相率逃亡。上月初，阎锡山再次“手谕”其部下说：“查我官兵之潜逃，实我各级干部之最大耻辱，亦为我部队灭亡之祸根。近来潜逃之多，为数实堪惊人”。七月九日，驻霍县大阴之阎军四十四师三团第一营，一夜即向我解放区逃跑二十余人。十四日，驻赵城小胡麻阎军二○五团一营侦察员四名，于外出侦察时，全部向我投诚。七月内阎锡山在襄陵史村赵曲张里一带强征之壮丁，至月底即有二百四十人逃向我解放区，除一部回家外，且有一部参加了当地群众保卫家乡的自卫斗争。据极不完全的统计，从六月十六日到七月十四日的二十几天中，阎军逃来我解放区者达四百余人。阎军部队逃亡现象正逐日增加中。
