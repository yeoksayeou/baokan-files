Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, August 24th: The No. 1 Battalion of the 15th Traffic Police Regiment of the Kuomintang Traffic Police, which staged an anti-civil war uprising at Nanquan Station, was formally reorganized into the Independent Detachment of the Democratic National Salvation Army. A grand establishment meeting was held on the afternoon of the 18th, attended by more than 20,000 people from all walks of life. After the chairman announced the significance of the meeting, Wang Yifan, commander of the Independent Detachment of the Democratic National Salvation Army, led all officers and soldiers in a swearing-in ceremony under the supervision of Wang Yiting, speaker of the Jiaodong District Council, representing the 10 million people of the entire district. The oath roughly stated: "Our officers and soldiers, in order to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's policy of selling out the country and engaging in civil war, launched an uprising in Nanquan. Now, after discussion by all officers and soldiers, we are named the Independent Detachment of the Democratic National Salvation Army, vowing to join hands with the military and civilians of the liberated areas to struggle for the establishment of a new China. We will not hesitate to sacrifice ourselves. If there is any behavior that violates this oath, we are willing to be punished by the people." Then, Commander Wang Yifan gave a speech saying: "A week ago, we and all the advanced friends present were still in a state of hostility, but now we have embarked on a common path. Since entering the liberated areas, we have received warm welcome and condolences from all walks of life, and we are truly grateful beyond words. In the future, we will only stand on the side of the people and fight to the end to express our gratitude. This is the world of the people, and only here dare I speak the truth in my heart. Chiang Kai-shek wants to control the troops with secret agents, but he will never succeed. In the past, we were trained by Dai Li, Chiang's trusted direct line, but we are unwilling to use American weapons to slaughter our own compatriots. After this blow, Chiang Kai-shek should realize something, otherwise we will use the weapons he issued to strike him!" Wang Yiting, speaker of the Jiaodong Council, and Cao Manzhi, director of the Jiaodong Administrative Office, delivered speeches successively, paying their respects and congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the Independent Detachment of the Democratic National Salvation Army. After representatives of the masses from all walks of life presented flags, the Victory Theater performed the Peking opera "Driven to Join Liangshan" to add to the festivities.

Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, August 24th: Wang Yifan (previously mistakenly reported as Wang Yifang), the battalion commander of the No. 1 Battalion of the 15th Traffic Police Regiment of the Kuomintang Traffic Police, who led the armed anti-civil war uprising in Nanquan, recently wrote an article elaborating on the reasons for this uprising. The original article roughly stated: We are the armed forces of Chiang Kai-shek's trusted subordinates led by the secret agent leader Dai Li. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, under the instruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries' fallacy of "saving the country through a tortuous path," some were ordered to surrender to the Japanese invaders and engage in "underground work" against the Communist Party and the people in conjunction with the Japanese invaders. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, they were reorganized into the Traffic Police of the Ministry of Transportation of the Kuomintang government, with a total of 18 regiments. Our salaries and allowances were higher than those of other Chiang's troops in some places because we were Chiang's trusted troops, such as exemption from mixing coarse grains in staple food. In addition, there were some special agents who were particularly loyal and trusted by Chiang, who secretly received private subsidies from Chiang. Our uprising in Nanquan on the Jiaoji Railway this time was beyond Chiang's expectation. I think he would think: "That's strange, how come even my trusted troops don't listen to me?!" The reason for this uprising is very simple: we are unwilling to risk our lives for Chiang's personal gain and do things that violate the will of the people. After eight years of bloody war, our country made the Japanese invaders surrender unconditionally, recovered the lost territories, and restored sovereignty. The compatriots across the country were celebrating the arrival of peace and were preparing to build the country together. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek harbored evil intentions and launched a nationwide civil war, driving countless young people away from their homes to serve as cannon fodder, intending to eliminate democratic forces in order to consolidate his personal throne. In order to obtain the assistance of American imperialist elements, Chiang did not hesitate to sell out national sovereignty, allowing foreign ships to freely navigate inland rivers, and turning military ports and airports into US naval and air force bases. All measures were taken to cater to the reactionary elements of the United States, disregarding the country's position as a colony. In addition, Kuomintang officials at all levels engaged in corruption and embezzled the people everywhere, such as grain fund fraud, large-scale fraud involving accepting enemy and puppet materials, relief material fraud, and large-scale fraud in the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus, seeking profit at every turn, causing a tragic situation of industrial and commercial depression and people's hardship. If this continues, the country will no longer be a country. We sincerely hope that patriotic compatriots and people of justice will immediately oppose the civil war, embark on the path of truth, and work together to build an independent, peaceful, and democratic new China.

　　胶东起义交通警察大队
    成立民主救国军独立总队
    独立总队司令王一藩率全体官兵举行宣誓典礼
    誓与解放区军民携手合作为建立新中国而奋斗
    【新华社临沂二十四日电】在南泉车站举行反内战起义之国民党交通警察十五总队第一大队正式整编为民主救国军独立总队，已于十八日下午举行隆重的成立大会，到会各界群众两万余人。主席宣布开会意义后，即在胶东区参议长王一亭代表全区一千万人民监誓下，由民主救国军独立总队司令王一藩率领全体官兵举行宣誓典礼。誓词略称：“本军官兵为反对蒋介石卖国内战政策，由南泉起义。现经全体官兵公议，定名为民主救国军独立总队，誓与解放区军民携手合作，为建立新中国而奋斗。虽粉身碎骨，亦在所不辞。如有违反誓言行为，愿受人民之制裁。”接着王一藩司令致词谓：“一周前我们和所有到会的先进朋友们还处在敌对状态，现在则已走上共同的道路。进入解放区以来，备受各界热诚欢迎与慰劳，实感激得说不出话来。今后唯有站在在人民方面奋斗到底，以表答谢。这里是人民的天下，我才敢说出结合在心里的真话。蒋介石想以特务控制部队，但决不能成功。过去我们就是戴笠一手培养的蒋的亲信嫡系，但我们都不愿以美国武器残杀自己同胞。经过这次打击，蒋介石该有所觉悟，否则我们要用他发给的武器来打击他！”胶东参议会王一亭议长及胶东行署曹漫之主任相继致词，向民主救国军独立总队全体官兵致敬与祝贺。各界群众代表献旗后，即由胜利剧团上演平剧“逼上梁山”助兴。
    【新华社莱阳二十四日电】领导南泉反内战武装起义的国民党交通警察第十五总队第一大队王一藩（前误为王一芳）大队长，顷特撰文阐述此次举义缘由，原文略称：我们是特务头子戴笠所统率的蒋介石亲信的武装部队。在抗战期间，在国民党反动派“曲线救国”谬论指示下，一部分奉命投降日寇，结合日寇从事反共反人民的“地下工作”。抗战胜利后，又合编为国民党政府交通部交通警察，共十八个总队，我们的薪券饷因系蒋的亲信部队，故在某些地方超过其他蒋军，如主粮免配杂粮等即是。另外还有一些对蒋特别忠实亲信的特务干部，密领蒋私人津贴。我们这次在胶济线南泉举义，实出乎蒋的意料。我想他会这样想：“怪了，怎么连我亲信的部队也不听我的话了？！”这次起义的理由原很简单，就是不愿再以热血头颅为蒋个人拚命，而干违背老百姓意志的勾当。我国经八年浴血抗战，使日寇无条件投降，光复了失地，恢复了主权，全国同胞方庆和平到来，正拟共同建设国家之际，不料蒋介石包藏祸心，发动全国性内战，驱使无数青年背乡离井，充当炮灰，意在消灭民主力量，以巩固其个人的宝座。为换得美帝国主义分子之援助，蒋更不惜出卖国家主权，允外轮自由航行内河，军港飞机场都变成美海空军基地，一切措施唯美国反动派鼻息是仰，置国家于殖民地地位而不顾。再加以国民党官僚层层舞弊，到处贪民，如粮款舞弊、接受敌伪物资大舞弊案、救济物资舞弊案、京沪京杭两铁路管理局大舞弊案等，唯利是图，上下其手，致造成国内工商凋弊民不聊生之惨祸，长此以往，国将不国。深望爱国同胞正义人士，即时反对内战，踏上真理的大道，同心协力，建设独立和平民主的新中国。
