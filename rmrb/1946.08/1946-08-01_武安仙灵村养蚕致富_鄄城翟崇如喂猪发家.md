　　Wu'an Xianling Village Prospering Through Silkworm Rearing
    Juancheng Zhai Chongru Getting Rich by Raising Pigs
    [Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] The Sixth District of Wu'an County recently held an enlarged cadre meeting, calling on the entire district to universally plant mulberry trees and develop silkworm rearing, truly achieving "cultivating three parts of land and having a surplus of one." Xianling Village in the Mendao River valley is a small mountain village. Before the War of Resistance, a few households raised silkworms, but this stopped after the war. This year, after the government called for the development of sideline production, all sixty households in the village raised a surprising eighty-five silkworm beds, greatly exceeding the pre-war number. In the first half of this year, they harvested a total of 5,500 jin of cocoons, which were spun into silk and sold for 900,000 yuan in foreign currency. After deducting labor costs (650 yuan per worker), each household had an average income of 15,000 yuan. Now, the newly added thirty-five piglets, five donkeys, and one cow in Xianling Village were all bought with only a portion of the profits from silkworm rearing. This fact has greatly encouraged cadres and the masses throughout the district to have confidence in developing sideline production such as silkworm rearing.
    [Report from Heze by this newspaper] Zhai Chongru, a villager of Wangqing Village in Juancheng County, relied on raising pigs to survive several years of famine and became wealthy. Zhai Chongru's family of seven had only 2.7 mu of land. During the famine of 1943, they did not have enough to eat, so he began experimenting with raising pigs. That year, two sows gave birth to twenty-five piglets, earning him a total of 25,000 yuan. Since then, he has had several litters of piglets every year and has also accumulated fifteen or sixteen large cartloads of pig manure. To date, in four years, he has earned more than 152,000 yuan just from selling piglets. He now has 42.7 mu of land. Besides the 11.7 mu he mortgaged in, the remaining 27.3 mu were bought with half of the money from selling piglets—74,800 yuan. His life has improved, and he tells everyone about the democratic government's policy of preventing disasters, preparing for famine, developing sideline occupations, and saving themselves through production. According to Zhai Chongru's experience, raising pigs is laborious, but even feeding as many pigs as he does only requires one full labor unit and does not delay other production.

　　武安仙灵村养蚕致富
    鄄城翟崇如喂猪发家
    【本报长治讯】武安六区日前在扩大干部会上，号召全区普遍植桑发展养蚕业，确实做到耕三余一。该区仙灵村，是门道川里一个小山庄，抗战前有个别户养蚕，战后停顿，今年经政府号召发展副业生产后，全村六十户人家竟养了八十五席蚕，大大超过战前数量。今年上半年共收茧五千五百斤，抽成丝共卖洋九十万元，除去工价（每工六百五十元）外，每户平均收入一万五千元。现在仙灵村新增加的三十五口小猪、五头驴、一头牛，都只是用养蚕利钱的一部分买来的。这个事实，大大鼓舞了全区干部群众发展养蚕等副业生产的信心。
    【本报荷泽讯】鄄城王清庄村民翟崇如靠养猪渡过几年的灾荒，并且发了家。翟崇如家里七口人，只种二亩七分地，四三年闹灾荒不够吃，他便开始试验喂猪，那一年两口母猪下了二十五个小猪，共赚二万五千元。以后每年都产几窝小猪，还可以积十五六大车猪粪，到现在为止，四年间光卖小猪就赚了十五万二千多块钱。他现有四十二亩七分地，除典入的十一亩七分，其余二十七亩三分是用卖小猪钱的一半——七万四千八百元买来的。他的生活改善了，见人便宣传民主政府防灾备荒、发展副业、生产自救的方针。据翟崇如的经验：养猪虽费事，像他喂那样多猪也只要一个整工便够了，一点也不耽误别的生产。
