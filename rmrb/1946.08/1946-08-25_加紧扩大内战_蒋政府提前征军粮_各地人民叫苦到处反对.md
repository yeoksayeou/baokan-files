　　Stepping Up the Expansion of the Civil War
　　The Chiang Government Advances Military Grain徴收
　　People Everywhere Complain and Oppose
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st—Shanghai News: The Nationalist government originally stipulated that agricultural tax in kind and requisition would begin in September, but now the need for military grain for the civil war is very urgent. Various provinces have started徴收 in advance, and the people are complaining about it. The Zhejiang Provincial Government ordered last month: "In counties and cities with early harvests,徴收 should be started in mid-July." Zhejiang Province was originally a grain-deficient province. This year, it needs to produce about six million shi of grain. For 20 million people, including young children and old people, the average person has to produce two hu of "agricultural tax," not including local apportionments and extortion. Recently, a popular saying among the people is: "We have resisted the white terror!" Shaanxi's agricultural tax of more than two million shi has also been started in mid-month. Before the徴收, the people were already in a state of panic, as if a catastrophe was imminent. Hunan, which has suffered an unprecedented drought, has an agricultural tax quota of four million shi this year, a requisition of 1.2 million shi, and a surtax of 1 million shi, for a total of 6.2 million shi. It was also proposed to start徴收 in mid-month.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st—According to Shanghai reports: People in various places continue to oppose extortion of military grain and agricultural tax徴收 in kind. The Sichuan native student associations of four schools, National Jiaotong University, Shanghai Law College, Shanghai Taxation College, and National Tongji University, sent a telegram to the whole country at the beginning of this month, opposing continued徴收 in kind, stating: The rural economy of Sichuan Province is on the verge of bankruptcy. This year, there was a spring drought, followed by floods. Warehouses are empty and resources are exhausted, and disaster victims are everywhere, displaced and begging in all directions. Try closing your eyes and thinking about it, isn't the situation tragic!? If the government continues徴收 in kind, it will plunge our Shu people into a deep abyss! Ninety-four students from Sichuan Province at the National Southwestern Associated University also jointly sent a telegram, recounting that during the War of Resistance, Sichuan Province provided 16 million conscripts and 60 million shi of grain. After the end of the War of Resistance, the government ordered a one-year exemption from agricultural tax, but who knew that the order would be changed in the morning and the promise broken in the evening, deceiving the people. This is intolerable! The Henan Disaster Appeal Group, after arriving in Beijing last month, petitioned the Ministry of Food on the 16th. Xu Kan was out, and Vice Minister Pang Songzhou received them. The representatives recounted the suffering of the Henan people, with tears in their eyes. After Xu returned, he excused himself as "tired" and refused to meet them. The representatives were very angry and said that Xu must come out. They would not leave without meeting him. Xu was forced to come out, but he did not listen to the representatives' statements and said, "I am clear about the situation in Henan. I will tell Chairman Chiang and Dean Song when I get back," and then left the meeting. The representatives were forced to withdraw, grumbling repeatedly. In addition, the Guangdong Province's agricultural purchase徴收 in kind this year has a purchase quota of six dou and five sheng per liang. The province徴收 a total of 4.5 million shi and sought back old debts from the 34th year of the Republic to supply military grain. However, according to the exaggerated estimates of the Field Grain Office, this year's upper season harvest in Guangdong Province was only 50%, producing about 38.41 million shi of grain. The half-year food shortage for the people is still 20.19 million shi, and the food problem is extremely serious. People from all walks of life in Guangdong Province are calling out and opposing grain徴收 and徴收 in kind.

　　加紧扩大内战
　　蒋政府提前征军粮
　　各地人民叫苦到处反对
    【新华社延安二十一日电】沪讯：国民党政府原规定于九月起开始田赋征实及征借，现已内战军粮需要甚急，各省已纷纷提前开征，人民对此叫苦连声。浙江省府于上月命令：“在有早种收获的各县市提前于七月中开征”。浙省原为缺米省份，今年须出粮米约六百万石，二千万人连小娃娃老头子，平均每人要出“田赋”两斛，而地方摊派勒索还不在内。最近民间流行一句话：“抗来了白色恐怖！”陕西田赋二百多万石，亦提前于本月中旬开征，在开征前，人民即惶惶然，若大难临头。遭逢空前旱灾的湖南，今年田赋额达四百万石，征借一百二十万石，带征公粮一百万石，共六百二十万石，亦提出于本月中旬开征。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据沪报载：各地人民继续反对勒索军粮及田赋征实，国立交大、上海法学院、上海税专、国立同济大学四校川籍同学会，于本月初通电全国，反对继续征实，略谓：川省农村经济已濒破产，今年春旱见于前，水灾继于后，仓空匮乏，灾黎遍野，流离辗转，行乞四方，试闭目以思，状宁不惨！？政府若复继续征实，是重陷吾蜀人民于水深火热之中矣！国立西南联大川籍学生九十四人，亦联名通电，历述抗战中川省出丁千六百万，出粮六千万石，抗战结束后，政府令免田赋一年，孰知竟朝令夕改，食言欺民，是可忍孰不可忍？！豫灾哭诉团于上月抵京后，于十六日至粮食部请愿，适徐堪外出由次长庞松舟接见，各代表历陈豫民痛苦，声泪俱下。徐归来后，又借口“疲乏”不见，各代表大愤，咸谓一定要徐出来，不见面不走，徐被迫出见后，竟不听各代表陈诉完毕，即谓“河南情形我清楚，回头告诉蒋主席宋院长”，即行离席。各代表被迫退出，忿忿连声。又粤省今年田购征实，购额每两征六斗五升，全省共征四百五十万石，并追索三十四年旧欠供应军粮，但即据田粮处的夸大估计，今年上季广东全省收成亦仅有五成，约产谷三千八百四十一万石，半年民食尚缺二千零十九万石，粮食问题极为严重。粤省各界人民正纷纷呼吁，并反对征粮征实。
