Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Moscow on July 25th, the cost of living for Soviet people has gradually decreased since the war, and consumer goods are becoming more abundant. After the Ministry of Commerce ordered price reductions in commercial stores at the beginning of this month, prices have been reduced by an average of 40%. Some goods have been further discounted by 25% after the price reduction, resulting in crowded stores, indicating that Soviet people can now purchase items that are somewhat more expensive than rationed goods. The monthly salary of Soviet technicians has increased from 800 rubles before the war to 3,000 rubles. Many farmers visit towns during holidays to shop in commercial stores. Three months ago, farmers purchased a large number of public bonds with cash, indicating their substantial income. The income of workers and professionals is more than enough to purchase rationed goods. In ration stores, a pair of leather shoes costs only 150 to 190 rubles, and a cloth jacket costs only 300 rubles. The Soviet government is now striving to abolish all rationing, which is a feature of the post-war five-year plan. The recent price reductions in commercial stores are intended to gradually lower the prices of goods in non-rationed stores until they are equal to those of rationed goods.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Washington dispatch: The White House recently released a statement from the Department of Commerce stating that in the sixteen days following the abolition of price controls on June 30th, the prices of twenty-eight major commodities rose by more than 25%. The prices of grains, beef, butter, lead, and copper are already higher than after the end of World War I in 1919. The details of the recent overall price increase have not yet been fully clarified, and the price surge has not yet subsided. If the Office of Price Administration is not restored, the surge may be even worse than it is today. However, according to officials from the former Office of Price Administration, although price controls will be restored, price limits will be based on new standards, many of which will be higher than on June 30th.

　　苏联物价低落美国物价飞涨
    【新华社延安十六日电】据美联社莫斯科七月二十五日讯：战后苏联人民生活费已逐渐低落，消费品亦渐见充盈，商部自本月初下令营业商店减价后，已平均减低四成。有些货物于减价后更打七五折，因此各店顾客云集，足见苏联人民已能购买若干较配给品价高昂之物。苏联技术人员之月薪从战前八百卢布增至三千卢布，假日农民至镇上营业商店购物者颇多。三月前农民曾以现款购买大批公债，足见其收入之不菲。工人及职业人员之收入用以购买配给品绰绰有余。在配给商店中，一双皮鞋只需一百五十至一百九十卢布，一件布褂只需三百卢布。苏联政府现力谋取消一切配给，此为战后五年计划之特点。最近营业商店之减价即拟使非配给商店之货价逐渐降低，至与配给品相等。
    【新华社延安十六日电】华盛顿讯：白宫于日前公布商务部之文告称：物价管制机关于六月三十日撤废后，在七月份十六天内，二十八种主要商品涨价百分之二十五以上。谷类、牛肉、牛油、铅、铜之价格已较一九一九年第一次世界大战结束后为高，最近物价全面上涨，详情迄未全部明了，物价涨风仍未稍戢。若物价管制处不恢复，涨风恐较今日尤甚。然据原物价管制处官员称，物价管制虽将恢复，唯物价限价将按照新标准，多较六月三十日为高。
