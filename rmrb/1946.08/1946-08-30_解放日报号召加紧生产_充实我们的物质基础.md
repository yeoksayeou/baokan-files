Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: Today, the Liberation Daily published an editorial entitled "Enriching Our Material Foundation." The editorial first mentioned the bumper harvest of summer wheat in various liberated areas this year. Wheat production on the mountains increased by 900 million jin. In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region, Jicheng County alone increased production by 93,000 shi compared to last year. In the Su-Wan border region, Huaiyin County's yield per mu was 150 to 300 jin. This bumper harvest is of great significance for winning the self-defense war, enabling the military and civilians in the liberated areas not only to have enough to eat but also to live a better life. The editorial then discussed the reasons for the bumper harvest in the liberated areas: Favorable weather conditions were indeed an important factor, but the more important factors were: (1) Farmers' enthusiasm for production was increased after the anti-traitor liquidation and rent reduction and interest reduction movement. (2) The governments of the liberated areas not only abolished exorbitant taxes and eliminated bandits, but also issued large amounts of agricultural loans (such as 370,000,000 yuan issued in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region) to solve farmers' difficulties with plowing cattle, seeds, and farm implements, and led the people to build water conservancy projects, dig wells, and repair canals, benefiting approximately 30 million mu of land throughout the liberated areas. On the occasion of celebrating the summer wheat harvest, the editorial specifically put forward the following tasks: (1) Protect the harvested grain and prevent the reactionaries from snatching a single grain. (2) Organize the labor force in a planned way and speed up the preparation for all autumn harvest work in order to strive for a full-year harvest. In Su-Wan, Ji-Zhong, and other places, it is necessary to prevent floods. (3) Ensure a bumper harvest of cotton fields and promote spinning yarn in every household and weaving cloth in every village. Finally, the editorial emphasized that in order to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, we must enrich our material foundation, strive for production, and achieve complete self-sufficiency in all daily necessities; at the same time, we must make long-term plans, save manpower and material resources, and avoid waste, so that the 140 million people in the liberated areas can still improve productivity and improve their lives in the self-defense war, in order to win the final victory of the self-defense war.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: This year, the wheat harvest in various liberated areas is generally abundant, and the autumn harvest is also expected to be abundant. Wheat production in the Shandong Liberated Area increased by 900 million jin. The average yield per mu in the Bohai and Binhai areas was 140 jin. The harvest in the Jiaodong and Luzhong areas also increased by 200 million jin compared to last year. Jizhong Plain, a famous wheat warehouse in Hebei, planted 8.95 million mu of wheat this year. If the average harvest per mu is 7 dou, its 8 million people can get 7 dou per person. In 13 counties including Leting and Fengrun in eastern Hebei, wheat fields reached more than 1 million mu, with some yielding more than 1 shi per mu. As for the autumn crops in the liberated areas, they are also generally thriving. The ears of autumn crops in various parts of Shandong are full and plump, and the harvest scene is unprecedented in the past decade. On the Tai (an) Lai (wu) Plain, a famous millet producing area, the grain is five to six feet tall, and the ears are more than a foot long. It is estimated that each large mu (960 square steps) can harvest 2,000 jin of millet; corn and sorghum can also produce 1,000 jin. In Yishan District and various parts of Bohai, the ears of grain are three fingers longer than last year, and the ears of sorghum are also two fingers longer. In Kedong, Baiquan, Keshan and other counties in Beihai, Northeast, experienced veteran farmers said that this year, the minimum yield of millet per hectare is 3 shi, an increase of two times compared to last year's 1 shi per hectare; corn can also yield 5 shi normally this year, and potatoes can yield 12,000 jin (20 shi). Now, in the vast fields of Beigou, which has not been liberated for long, soybeans have partially bloomed, corn has produced red tassels, and millet is also more than two feet tall, all presenting a scene of bumper harvest. Now farmers in various places are full of joy, preparing farm tools to welcome the autumn harvest. In the Taiyue area of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu border region, the average yield of more than 10 million mu of wheat fields is 8 dou to 1 shi per mu (14 jin per dou). Yicheng County increased production by 93,000 shi compared to last year. In the newly liberated areas of southern Hebei, Xiajin, Qinghe, Enxian, Gucheng and the eight counties of Pingyuan, a total of more than 870,000 mu of wheat fields were planted, harvesting more than 87 million dou, an increase of more than 30 million jin compared to last year. In the Su-Wan area, taking Huaiyin as an example, the yield per mu was 150 to 300 jin, and the total output of the county was 64 million jin, more than double that of last year.

　　解放日报号召加紧生产
    充实我们的物质基础
    【新华社延安二十七日电】本日解放日报发表社论题为“充实我们的物质基础”。社论中首述各解放区今年夏麦丰收，山上小麦增产九万万斤，晋冀鲁豫仅冀城一县比去年增产九万三千石，苏皖边区淮阴县每亩产量为一百五十斤到三百斤。这一丰收对于争取自卫战的胜利实有重大的意义，并使解放区军民在自卫战争中不仅人人有饭吃，而且还能过更好的光景。继述及解放区丰收的原因：风调雨顺的自然条件固不失为一个重要原因，但更重要的条件则是：（一）农民经过了反奸清算减租减息运动，生产情绪因而提高。（二）解放区政府不仅取消苛杂，消灭盗匪，并且发放大量农贷（如晋察冀边区即发三十七万万元），解决农民耕牛、籽种、农具等困难，并领导人民兴修水利打井修渠，全解放区受益地亩约在三千万亩以上。在目前庆祝夏麦丰收之际，社论中特提出下列任务：（１）保卫已收获的粮食，不让反动派抢走一颗。（２）有计划的组织劳动力，加紧准备一切秋收工作，以争取全年的丰收。在苏皖冀中等地，要防止水灾。（３）保证棉田丰收，提倡家家纺纱，村村织布。最后社论中着重指出为了粉碎蒋介石的进攻，必须充实我们的物质基础，必须努力生产，使一切日用必须品达到完全自给；同时必须作持久打算，节省使用人力物力，力戒浪费，使解放区一万万四千万人民，在自卫战争中，仍能提高生产力与改善生活，以赢得自卫战争的最后胜利。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】各解放区今年麦子普遍丰收，秋禾亦丰收有望。山东解放区小麦增产九万万斤。渤海、滨海两区每亩平均产量一百四十斤。胶东、鲁中两区收获量亦较去年增加二万万斤。河北著名小麦仓库——冀中平原，今年播种小麦即达八百九十五万亩，如果平均每亩收获七斗计，其八百万人口每人可得七斗。冀东乐亭、丰润等十三县，麦田则达一百余万亩，其中每亩产量有逾一石者。至于解放区的秋禾亦普遍的茁壮茂盛。山东各地之秋禾穗粒饱满，丰收景象为近十年来所未有。著名之小米产区泰（安）莱（芜）平原上，谷高五六尺，谷穗长达尺余，预计谷子每大亩（九百六十方步）可收二千斤；玉蜀黍高粱亦产一千斤。沂山区及渤海各地，谷穗较去年长出三指，高粱穗亦长二指。东北北海之克东、拜泉、克山等县，据有经验之老农谈，今年谷子每垧最少可打三石，较之去年每垧收一石增产两倍；包谷今年平常亦可收五石，土豆子可收一万二千斤（二十石）。现在此解放不久的北沟广阔田野中，大豆已部分开花，包米已出红须，糜子亦有二尺多，一切呈现着丰收景象。现各地农民均喜气洋洋，准备农具迎接秋季丰收。晋冀鲁豫边区太岳全区，一千余万亩麦田平均每亩八斗至一石（每斗十四斤）。翼城一县比去年增产九万三千石。冀南新解放区夏津、清河、恩县、故城及平原八县，共种麦田八十七万余亩，收获八千七百余万斗，较去年增产三千×百余万斤。苏皖两淮地区，以淮阴为例，每亩产量为一百五十斤到三百斤，全县产量为六千四百万斤，超过去年一倍。
