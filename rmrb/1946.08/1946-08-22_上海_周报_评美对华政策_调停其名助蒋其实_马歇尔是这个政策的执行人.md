Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: A report from Shanghai: The "Weekly Review," issue 47, published here at the end of July, carried an article by Fan Hui entitled "Four Stages of American Policy Towards China," analyzing the US policy towards China after Marshall was appointed US Special Envoy to China. It said: "The main focus of the US policy towards China in this stage was to limit the military situation within the pass to a certain foundation, while on the other hand, condoning and helping the Kuomintang and its government to develop towards outside the pass."

Fan said: In order to implement this policy, Marshall urged the Kuomintang and its government to convene the Political Consultative Conference and issued a ceasefire order, but specifically excluded the Northeast. During this period, US naval vessels were used to transport the Kuomintang's US-equipped troops to the Northeast. Furthermore, US Marines constantly guarded the only supply line from Beiping to outside the pass for the Kuomintang – the Beining Railway. When these political and military deployments were completed, Marshall suddenly flew back to the United States. Then, the Kuomintang government launched anti-Soviet movements in Shanghai, Chongqing, Beiping, Tianjin and other places, and the US State Department also issued statements in a timely manner, echoing each other. Until the Soviet army announced its withdrawal from the Northeast, Marshall returned to China. At that time, during the tense and fierce Northeast War, Marshall "adopted a hands-off attitude," and focused on "intensifying assistance in transporting Kuomintang troops to reinforce the Northeast" and "making every effort to suppress the spread of the war outside the pass to inside the pass." It was not until the 184th Division launched an anti-civil war uprising and the Kuomintang army attacking Harbin was contained that "this old general resumed his activities and became active again." Fan stated that the outbreak of the wars in the Central Plains, Northern Jiangsu, and Southern Shanxi was the result of the US policy condoning the Kuomintang reactionaries' expansion of the civil war.

It also exposed the false face of American "mediation," saying: When Xuanhua Store was in imminent danger, Marshall did not say a word, but when Li Xiannian's army broke through to the west and might enter Sichuan and Shaanxi, Marshall hurriedly sent an executive group to mediate and stop them. Marshall would not speak out if a Communist base area was cut off, but if it took too much time to cut off this base area, or if it caused other problems, or if it caused the Kuomintang to suffer losses, then Marshall would immediately "mediate." "We should also view the ongoing Northern Jiangsu war in the same way." The author pointed out the current state of the Kuomintang, which does not declare the existence of a full-scale civil war, but in essence fights in this regionally separated state, saying: "If the Kuomintang fights well, then the United States may simply let it continue to fight; if it does not fight well, the United States will immediately come out to mediate."

　　上海“周报”评美对华政策
　  调停其名助蒋其实
　　马歇尔是这个政策的执行人
    【新华社延安十九日电】沪讯：此间七月底出版之“周报”四十七期载范蕙作“美国对华政策的四个阶段”一文，分析马歇尔受任美驻华特使后的美国对华政策说：“这一阶段的美国对华政策，主要的是想把关内的军事形势限制在一定的基础之上，而在另一方面则纵容并且帮助国民党及其政府向关外发展”。范氏说：马歇尔为了执行这个政策，所以督促国民党及其政府召开了政治协商会议，并颁布了停战命令，但是特别把东北除外，且在此期间，用美海军舰船运送国民党美械化部队去东北，更不断以美海军陆战队为国民党守卫从北平到关外唯一补给线——北宁路。当这些政治军事部署完成、马歇尔突飞返美国，接着国民党政府即发动沪渝平津各地的反苏运动，美国务院亦适时发表声明，互相呼应。迄苏军宣布自东北撤退，马歇尔就回到中国，当时紧张激烈的东北战争，马歇尔“却采取袖手旁观的态度”，而专心致力于“加紧帮助运送国民党军增援东北”和“竭力压制防止关外的战火蔓延及于关内”。直到一八四师举行反内战起义，向哈尔滨进攻的国民党军被遏阻，“这位老将军才又恢复活动，重新积极起来”。范氏陈述中原、苏北和晋南战事的爆发，即美国政策纵容国民党反动派扩大内战所致。并揭露美国“调停”的假面目称：当宣化店岌岌可危之时，马歇尔没有说一句话，但当李先念军突围西进，可能入川入陕之际，马歇尔赶忙派执行小组来调处阻止了。割掉一块中共基地，马歇尔不会出面说话，但倘若因割这块基地而花了太多的时间，或会引起别的问题，或会叫国民党反而吃亏，那马歇尔是立刻便要“调停”的。对正在开展中的苏北战争，我们也当作如是观”。作者指出目前国民党里面不宣布全面内战的存在，而骨子里却这样地区分别的打的状态说：“国民党打的好，那美国就可能索性让它打下去；打得不好，美国是会马上出来调停的”。
