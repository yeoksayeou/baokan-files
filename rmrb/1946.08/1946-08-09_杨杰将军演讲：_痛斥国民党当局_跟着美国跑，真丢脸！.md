　　Yang Jie's Speech:
    Denouncing the Kuomintang Authorities
    "Following America, Truly Shameful!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: The Chongqing Minzhu Bao (Democratic News) reported on July 4th that former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, General Yang Jie, at the invitation of the Kunming Student Union, gave a speech at Yunnan University, vehemently denouncing the Kuomintang authorities for various measures of national betrayal and humiliation. Yang said: Now they are simply "following America's lead" and running after the United States. Due to America's intentions, defeated nation Japan is even allowed to fish in our territorial waters, and foreign customs commissioners have also been invited. It is truly shameful! When talking about the Soviet Union, General Yang praised the Soviet Union as a continental military power, relying on its strong army, it defeated both Western and Eastern fascists. Some attribute Japan's surrender to the atomic bomb, but this is ridiculous. Without the Soviet Union's powerful army, Japanese fascism could not have been defeated.

　　杨杰将军演讲：
    痛斥国民党当局
    “跟着美国跑，真丢脸！”
    【新华社延安六日电】渝民主报七月四日载：前驻苏大使杨杰将军日前应昆明学联邀请，在云大演讲，痛斥国民党当局种种丧权辱国的措施。杨氏说：现在惟“马首是瞻”的跟着美国跑，由于美国的意旨，战败国日本竟可至我领海内捕鱼，海关税务司也请外国来了，真是丢脸！谈及苏联时，杨将军盛赞苏联为大陆军国，凭着她的强大陆军，她打垮了西方东方两个法西斯。有人把日本投降归功于原子弹，其实这是可笑的。没有苏联强大的陆军，日本法西斯是打不倒的。
