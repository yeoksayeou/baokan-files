　　Chiang Kai-shek Shields the Traitor Chu Minyi

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 18th: The case of the traitor Chu Minyi, who collaborated with the enemy and betrayed the country, which has been pending for a long time without a verdict, has been obstructed again due to Chiang Kai-shek's handwritten order for "leniency." According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on August 3rd, Chu Minyi's wife, Chu Chen Shunzhen, submitted "new evidence" and filed a petition for retrial with the Jiangsu Higher Court on the 2nd, attaching Chiang Kai-shek's handwritten order. The handwritten order stated: "Although Chu Minyi deserves his punishment, considering that he followed the Father of the Nation in revolutionary activities for many years, and that upon the enemy's announcement of surrender, he was able to shift his heart and mind, prepare for handover, and maintain social order, he should be treated with leniency."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 18th: According to a special dispatch from the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao in Taiyuan: The Shanxi Higher Court publicly tried the pseudo-provincial governor Feng Siyi on the 3rd of this month. Feng confessed to the fact that he "protected" the "underground workers" "sent back" by Yan Xishan and appointed them as pseudo-county magistrates, and begged for lenient punishment.
