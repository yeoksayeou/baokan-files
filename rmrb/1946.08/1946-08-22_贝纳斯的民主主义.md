　　"Bevin's Democracy"
　　*Pravda* Article Commentary
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] TASS reports: Lyapov wrote an article in *Pravda* entitled "Bevin's Democracy." He wrote: What happened at the August 12th meeting (referring to Bevin's attempt to prevent the Soviet representative from speaking, which was refuted by Vyshinsky based on reason) was that this American chief representative appointed himself as the boss of the meeting and believed that everything had to be approved by him. He openly tried to put the former enemy countries in a privileged position. The Soviet representative Vyshinsky had to use the shorthand record in hand to call on Bevin to abide by the rules. Only in this situation did Bevin have to back down. Bevin ignored the fact that he was acting as the chairman of an international conference, not as the chairman of a State Department meeting on Panama and Honduras issues. In the latter case, they can take off their coats, put their feet on the table, and feel very much at home. Bevin ignored the fact that the meeting he was chairing was attended by representatives of independent and free countries, not just servants who often become part of the Anglo-American bloc. He thought that his position as chairman was like a petty king in some places. This is Bevin's democracy. Bevin suffered a crushing defeat. The same passionate but clumsy support from the British side did not help him. The democratic principles fought for by the Soviet delegation prevailed. It is said that Bevin was very unhappy at the meeting that day. This was truly self-inflicted!

　　“贝纳斯的民主主义”
　　真理报撰文评论
    【新华社延安十八日电】塔斯社报导：李雅波夫在真理报上撰文，题为“贝纳斯的民主主义”，他写道：八月十二日和会所发生的事情（按系指贝纳斯企图阻止苏联代表发言，但为维辛斯基据理驳倒），是这位美国的首席代表自定为会议的老板，并且认为一切事情都要经他允许才行，他公开试图把过去的敌国放在特权地位，苏联代表维辛斯基不得不以手头速记的记录叫贝纳斯遵守规则，只是在这种情况之下，贝纳斯才不得不退让了。贝纳斯忽视了如下的事实：即他是在当一个国际会议的主席，而不是在当国务院关于巴拿马和洪都拉斯问题会议的主席。在后一场合，他们可以脱掉大衣，把双脚搁在桌子上，觉得很像在家里一样的。贝纳斯忽视如下的事实，即他在当主席的会议乃由独立自由的各国代表所参加，而不仅仅是由经常成为美英集团的仆从参加而已。他以为他当主席的地位，有如某些地方的小王一样，这是贝纳斯的民主主义。贝纳斯遭到了惨败，同样的激情而笨拙的英国方面的支持也帮助不了他，苏联代表团所力争的民主原则胜利了。据说在当天的会议上，贝纳斯很不愉快，这真是自作自受！
