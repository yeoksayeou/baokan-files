　　Masinu's Talk:
    The Kuomintang Reactionaries' Attack on the Liberated Areas is an Attack on Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th] Moscow's 5th radio broadcast a commentary by commentator Masinu, pointing out that the Kuomintang reactionaries' attack on the liberated areas is aimed at eliminating Sun Yat-sen's just advocacy of the Three Principles of the People, preventing the Three Principles of the People from being implemented throughout China. Soong Ching-ling recently issued a statement pointing out that the path of establishing a coalition government, implementing a democratic system and land reform is the path to the liberation of the Chinese people, and it is also the path to implementing Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Soong Ching-ling compared the situation in the Communist areas with that in the Kuomintang areas, pointing out that the reason why there is no famine in the Communist areas is because the Communists have implemented the political program of Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime, which was the foundation of the Kuomintang-Communist alliance. Therefore, foreign observers have praised the great achievements made by the CPC due to the implementation of this system. July 24th Reuters: The Manchester Guardian published an article pointing out many facts proving that credible administrative organs have been established in the CPC areas, which are much better than the organs established in the Kuomintang areas. July 26th Reuters reported: Anyone who has been to the CPC areas points out that these areas are the opposite of the Kuomintang areas. The Kuomintang's corruption and violence have reached such a point that the UNRRA recently stopped supplying materials because these materials were pocketed by senior Kuomintang officials. Chinese democrats have realized that the liberated areas are the basic base for implementing Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Therefore, they call the reactionaries' attack on these areas an attack on Sun Yat-sen's democracy.

　　马西努谈话：
    国民党反动派进攻解放区是进攻孙中山的三民主义
    【新华社延安六日电】莫斯科五日广播评论员马西努时事谈话，指出国民党反动派向解放区进攻是消灭孙中山三民主义正义主张，使三民主义不能在中国全国内实行。宋庆龄不久前发表声明，指出成立联合政府实行民主制度与土地改革的道路，是中国人民解放的道路，也就是实行孙中山三民主义的道路。宋庆龄以共产党区域的情形与国民党区域相比较，指出共产党的区域没有饥荒现象的原因，由于共产党人实行了孙中山先生在世时的政纲，这曾是国共联盟的基础。因此外国观察家无不称道中共由于实行这种制度而达到的巨大成绩。七月二十四日路透社讯：曼彻斯特导报发表论文指出许多事实，证明在中共区域内已建立了有威信的行政机关，比起国民党区域内所建立的机关要好的多。七月二十六日路透社报导：凡到过中共各地区的人，都指出这些地区与国民党区域相反。而国民党腐败与强暴的手段已达到如此地步，以致联总于不久前停止供给物资。因为这些物资都被国民党大官装入私囊。中国民主人士已认识到解放区是实行孙中山三民主义的基本根据地。因此，他们把反动派向这些区域的进攻叫做反对孙中山民主主义的进攻。
