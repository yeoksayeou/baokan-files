    ——The Mighty Power of the Fourth and Fifth Regimental Artillery

    On the way to departure, the artillerymen of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments, upon hearing that they would be cooperating with the 304th Regiment, said one after another, "We must fight well and win glory for our Fourth and Fifth Regiments."

    On the night of the 4th, the attack on Yezhucun, held by the 51st Regiment of the stubborn enemy, an elite regiment of the 17th Brigade, the mission of the Fourth and Fifth Regimental Artillery Company was to cooperate with the 304th Regiment in attacking the most vicious battalion that had been robbing the common people. The soldiers were all eager to fight, saying, "Damn it, you've occupied our territory for six and a half months and attacked us countless times. Today, we'll give it back to you!"

    Before dawn, the troops approached the east end of the village. Under the dense fire of bullets, the artillerymen fearlessly pushed the cannons to the place closest to the enemy's blockhouse. The enemy's blockhouse was more than two zhang high, and even the sheer earthen cliff was four zhang high. The two blockhouses were fifty or sixty meters apart, with an open space in front, and the blockhouses were sealed off layer by layer. Light and heavy machine guns on the blockhouses weaved a fire net in all directions.

    The artillerymen of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments set up their cannons in the fire net. The first shell landed squarely on top of the blockhouse, and cheers erupted on the front line. The enemy's machine guns frantically concentrated their fire, sparks flying in front of them, but the artillerymen seemed not to see it. With successive booming shots, the blockhouse burst open, and the enemy's machine guns went silent. Amidst the unanimous cheers of the infantry, a sharp charge bugle sounded, and the enemy rolled down from the blockhouse like rats, then burrowed into the outer trenches to resist stubbornly, throwing grenades one after another, but they couldn't stop the heroes of the 304th Regiment. In the blink of an eye, they had rushed to the edge of the outer trench... The enemy's first line of blockhouses was thus disintegrated.

    The sky was already bright, and the advance continued step by step. The artillery of the Fifth Regiment was the pioneer, and also the signal of victory. Every blockhouse, without a few shells, had its bricks and tiles flying and a skylight opened. In a series of seven or eight blockhouse lines, not a single blockhouse escaped the punishment of the shells.

    Comrade Jiang Tianrun, the squad leader of the fourth artillery squad, performed excellently in the attack that day.

    Although the enemy launched counterattacks, they were beaten into a disarray by the soldiers of the 304th Regiment, and the remaining ones fled to the final position of their regimental headquarters.

    The regimental headquarters was located in the Taishan Temple in Qianliren Village to the west, surrounded by 300 meters of open space, layered fortifications, small blockhouses in front and behind, and a large blockhouse standing in the courtyard. The machine gun and artillery company of the regimental headquarters alone had six heavy machine guns and five cannons. Concentrated here were three battalions of the 51st Regiment, a stubborn component, the regimental direct unit, one battalion of the 49th Regiment, and one company of the 55th Brigade.

    Out of consideration for the unnecessary sacrifices of the stubborn enemy soldiers, it was decided that an appeal would be made that night, hoping to peacefully persuade them to lay down their weapons. Before the appeal, our artillery first blasted a hole in the large blockhouse to let them know that there was no safe place to defend.

    However, the special agents of the stubborn enemy controlled their soldiers, and the appeal failed. The general attack began on the 6th. Comrade Chen Zhenglie, the artillery platoon leader (artillery hero), and Comrade Jiang Shengjun, the second squad leader, showed great prowess, accurately dropping every shell on the enemy's blockhouses. At this time, the artillery of the 301st Regiment also concentrated and bombarded together. Although the enemy also retaliated fiercely, they could not reverse their doom. In an instant, half of the blockhouse had collapsed. Suddenly, an enemy shell exploded near our gun emplacement, and platoon leader Chen Zhenglie was wounded, and second squad leader Jiang Shengjun also bled from his ears from the shock, but they did not relax their firing.

    The enemy's blockhouse went silent. Our infantry launched a charge, and an enemy company commander led seventy or eighty men to surrender first. Then, the infantry rushed into the temple courtyard.

    The temple courtyard was filled with dead and wounded. Lightly wounded by artillery shells were fifty or sixty, and more than a hundred were killed. The enemy regimental commander led soldiers to charge out at the risk of their lives, but in the end, they obediently laid down their weapons, and more than 500 officers and soldiers were all eliminated. By this time, it was noon.

    After the battle, the × regimental commander of the 304th Regiment said to the artillerymen of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments with a satisfied smile, "You guys shot very accurately."

    When we returned, our soldiers' grenade pouches were full of American bombs.

    They said, "We should cherish the honor of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments and win glory for the Fourth and Fifth Regiments!"

　　孟县自卫战
    ——四五部炮兵大显神威
    雁心
    四五部队的炮兵在出发途中，提到是和三○四部配合作战，大家便纷纷的说：“去了一定得打好，要给咱们四五部队争光。”
    四日晚，围攻冶戍村顽五十一团，这是十七旅的精锐团，四五部队炮兵连的任务是配合三○四部打那抢劫老百姓最凶恶的一营，战士们都磨拳擦掌的说：“妈的，你们占我们地方六个半月了，进攻我们不知多少次了，今天还你一下试试！”
    拂晓前，部队接近了村东头，在子弹扑扑的密射下，炮兵们毫不畏怯的把炮推到离敌人碉堡最近的地方。敌人的碉堡有二丈多高，连削立的土崖就有四丈高，两碉堡相距五六十米，正面一片开阔地，而碉堡周围却层层封锁，碉堡上轻重机枪把四面八方织成火网。
    四五部的炮兵就在火网中架起了炮，第一发炮弹就不偏不移的落在碉堡顶上，战线上掀起了喝采声。敌人机枪着急地集中打过来，面前火星乱跳，但是炮兵们好象没有看见似的，接连着轰轰几炮，碉堡开了花，敌人的机枪哑了。在步兵们一致的喝采声中，吹起了尖厉的冲锋号，敌人象老鼠一般从碉堡上滚下来，又钻到外壕里顽抗，手榴弹接二连三的抛掷着，但挡不住三○四部队的英雄。一转眼，他们已冲到外壕边，…………敌人的第一线碉堡就此瓦解。
    天已大亮，接着逐步推进，五四部的炮是开路先锋，也是胜利的信号。每一座碉堡不消几发炮弹便砖飞瓦裂开了天窗，一连七八道碉堡线，没有一个碉堡逃出了炮弹的惩罚。
    在这一天进攻中炮兵四班长姜天润同志顶呱呱。
    敌人虽然进行反扑，都被三○四部战士们打得东倒西歪，剩下的逃到他们团部的最后阵地去。
    团部在西面前里仁村的泰山庙内，周围三百米都是开阔地，层层工事，前后小碉堡，院中矗立一座大碉堡，光团部机炮连就有六挺重机枪，五门炮。集中在这的有五十一团三个营的顽强部分，团直属队、四十九团一个营和五十五旅一个连。
    为了顾念顽军士兵无谓的牺牲，当晚决定先进行喊话，希望能做到和平的争取他们放下武器。在喊话前我们的炮兵先照着大碉堡轰个窟窿，让他们知道已无险可守。
    可是顽军特务们控制着他们的兵士，喊话失效了，六日开始总攻。炮兵一排长陈正烈同志（炮兵英雄）和二班长蒋胜军同志大显威风，把每一颗炮弹准确地落在敌人碉堡上。这时，三○一部队的炮也集中过来，一齐轰击着，敌人虽然也猛烈的还击，但已挽不回厄运。顷刻间碉堡已塌了一半。忽然敌人一个炮弹在我们炮座附近炸开，排长陈正烈挂了彩，二班长蒋胜军也震得耳内出血，但他们并不放松射击。
    敌人的碉堡哑了。我们的步兵发起了冲锋，敌人一个连长带着七八十人先投过来，接着，步兵冲进大庙院。
    庙院内死伤枕籍，光炮弹炸伤的就有五六十个，死的有一百多，敌团长带士兵冒死冲出来，最后还是乖乖的放下武器，五百余官兵全被解决，这时天才交午。
    战后，三○四部×团长便带着满意的笑容对四五部的炮兵们讲：“你们打得真准。”
    回来时我们战士的手榴弹袋满满的装着美国炸弹。
    他们说：“我们应当爱护四五部的荣誉，为四五部队争光！”
