Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 14th: News reports: Chiang Kai-shek's faction is playing tricks with the Central Plains ceasefire agreement, continuing to attack Li Xiannian's troops, and refusing to allow General Li Xiannian's representatives to safely go to Xi'an for mediation. The Beiping Executive Headquarters issued a public statement, once again stipulating a ceasefire from the 6th, but as of the time of this dispatch, Chiang's troops are still continuing to attack the various breakout forces of Li Xiannian's troops. In southern Shaanxi, in addition to the original pursuing Chiang's troops, approximately five more divisions have been added, under the personal command of Hu Zongnan. In Zhushan, western Hubei, An Ruihe is organizing a new "encirclement and suppression" campaign in the Fangxian area; the main force of the 14th Army, originally responsible for guarding and transferred here, has also moved east to this area to implement blocking. In Taihu, southern Anhui, Chiang's troops have again launched a fierce offensive with four divisions since the 6th. According to Chiang's troops who have laid down their weapons, they are still under orders to annihilate the Communist army within a deadline. Zheng Jiemin, a government member of the Executive Headquarters, secretly ordered the armies not to be restricted by the agreement signed by the Ninth and Thirty-second Groups, otherwise the division and army commanders would be subject to military law. While Chiang's troops are attacking, the Chiang faction representatives of the Executive Headquarters' Ninth and Thirty-second Groups, who are negotiating the specific implementation of the ceasefire order in Xi'an, are also hindering the progress of the negotiations, repeatedly prohibiting Zhou Zijian, the representative formally entrusted by General Li Xiannian, from contacting the group. Although General Li has telegraphed the group agreeing to send representatives to Xi'an again, requesting the Chiang faction to guarantee their safety, the Chiang faction has consistently refused. The above facts show that the Chiang faction is systematically and practically overturning the ceasefire agreement, insisting on the goal of annihilating Li Xiannian's troops, and attempting to shift the responsibility for the conflict to the Communist army.

　　蒋方玩弄停战协议
    继续进攻李先念部
    【新华社延安十四日电】军息：蒋方玩弄中原停战协议继续向李先念部进攻，并不许李先念将军的代表安全到西安进行调处工作。北平执行部发表公报，再一次的规定自六日起停战，但截至发电时止，蒋军仍再向李先念部各路突围部队继续进攻。陕南方面除原有追击蒋军外，新增加约五个师的兵力，由胡宗南亲自指挥。鄂西竹山方面，安瑞河正在房县一带组织新的“围剿”；原来担任警卫调来的十四军主力也已东开到这个地区实行堵击。皖南太湖方面，蒋军又有四个师的力于六日兵又开始猛烈进攻。据放下武器的蒋军人员说，他仍奉命限期歼灭中共军。执行部政府委员郑介民并密令各军勿为第九第三十二小组签订之协议限制，否则各师长军长就要受到军法处分。与蒋军进攻的同时，于西安谈判停战命令具体实施办法的执行部第九第三十二小组的蒋方代表也尽是阻扰谈判进行，再三禁阻李先念将军所正式委托的代表周子健与小组联络。李将军虽已向小组复电同意即再派代表赴西安，要求蒋方保障安全，蒋方亦始终拒绝。上述事实显示蒋方有计划的在实际上推翻停战协议，坚持歼灭李先念部的目的，并妄图将冲突责任加到中共军方面。
