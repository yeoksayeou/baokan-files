Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. United Press, Washington, 6th: Republican Senator Brewster of Nebraska is strongly advocating the immediate withdrawal of the US Marines stationed in China and the reduction of the US military to only a basic cadre. He stated at a press conference that senior US military officers stationed in China told him that they did not understand why US troops could not withdraw from China earlier, and they sincerely feared that distributing the remaining weapons to the Chiang army might lead to American intervention in the Chinese civil war. He said that the tension between American soldiers and Marines and the Chinese people had so far caused 30 conflicts, resulting in casualties. Mr. Brewster also stated that UNRRA materials were being handled very improperly in China. Ships transporting supplies were moored in Chinese ports for many weeks without unloading, and once the supplies were ashore, they disappeared without a trace. It is reported that Mr. Brewster has just returned to the country after a global trip, visiting 28 countries, and traveling 35,000 miles.

    主张撤退驻华美军
    【新华社延安七日电】合众社华府六日讯：美内布拉斯加州共和党参议员布特威力主立即撤退驻华美国海军陆战队，并裁减美国军队至仅留下基本干部。他于记者招待会上称：驻在中国的美国高级军官告他说，他们不了解为何美军不能早自中国撤退，并且他们诚恐将剩余武器分与蒋军，可能造成美国干涉中国内战，并谓美国士兵海军陆战队与中国人民间的紧张状态，迄今已造成三十次冲突事件，招致了伤亡。布氏并称：联总物资在中国处理至为不当，运输物资船只在中国海港停泊许多星期不起，而一旦物资上岸以后，便都不翼而飞了。按布氏曾作环球旅行，经历二十八个国家，行程三万五千里，近飞返国。
