Observations on the Liberated Area
    郝鹏举

　　The giant wheel of the times is advancing rapidly in the torrent of democracy, and fascist rule has become the dregs of modern political systems. Because we recognized the needs of the times, we resolutely raised the banner of "Withdraw from the civil war, support democracy," and moved from the reactionary sphere of influence to the liberated area—the home of the people.

    Since we moved to the liberated area, after five months of rigorous training, the troops have made great progress in essence. All of our soldiers have begun a learning competition. Learning from the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army has resulted in: improved soldiers' lives, advanced management methods, strengthened unity within our army, and improved combat skills. We have not only become the people's armed forces, but also a powerful armed force. This is the most valuable gain our army has made since arriving in the liberated area.

    In the liberated area, we have received warm love and help from the military and civilians, especially when they often send us provisions and firewood from hundreds of miles away, which makes us extremely grateful and excited. Therefore, on the one hand, we conserve consumption to reduce the burden on the people, and on the other hand, we help the people with spring plowing and summer harvesting to increase the people's productive power, and implement the spirit of serving the people. The relationship between the military and civilians here is very harmonious, and we and the people of the liberated area have become one family.

    Since we are the people's armed forces, our thoughts and actions must be completely integrated with the interests of the people. We will sweat when the people want us to sweat; we will bleed when the people want us to bleed. Since the ceasefire agreement was issued, we thought the threat of civil war had been eliminated, and the people could enter a smooth path of peaceful construction. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed their faith, tore up all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, secret agent thugs committed crimes everywhere, and mobilized millions of troops to launch a frenzied offensive against the liberated area. From Central China, North China to the Northeast, the flames of civil war are everywhere, and the people have already suffered the planned massacre by the reactionaries.

    Our original intention in launching the uprising was to "withdraw from the civil war and support democracy." Now that the reactionaries, with the support of foreign imperialist elements, are once again creating civil war and destroying democracy, we must resolutely stand on the position of safeguarding the interests of the people, and are willing to join hands with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, with the determination to die and the belief in victory, to launch a sacred war of self-defense against the reactionaries attacking the liberated area in order to stop the civil war and defend peace and democracy.

　　解放区观感
    郝鹏举
    时代的巨轮已经在民主的洪流中激进，法西斯的统治已成为现代政治制度的残渣。我们因为认清了时代的需要，坚决的高举“退出内战，拥护民主”的义旗，从反动派的势力范围走向了解放区——人民的家乡。
    我们自移驻解放区以来，经过五个月的严格训练，部队已在本质上有了很大的进步。我们全体将士开始发动一种学习的竞赛运动。向八路军新四军学习结果：战士生活改善了，管理的方法进步了，本军的团结加强了，战斗的技术提高了；我们不仅成为人民的武装，而且成为一支有力的武装，这是本军开到解放区以来，所得到的最宝贵的收获。
    我们在解放区曾得到军民热烈的爱护与帮助，尤其他们常从百里以外送给我们给养柴草，真使我们万分的感激与兴奋。所以我们一方面节约消费减轻人民的负担，另一方面就帮助人民春耕夏收，以增加人民的生产力量，贯彻为人民服务的精神。在此军民关系非常融洽，我们和解放区的老百姓成了一家人。
    我们既然是人民的武装，那么我们思想上行动上就要完全和人民的利害结合起来，人民要我们流汗我们就流汗；人民要我们流血我们就流血。自从停战协定颁发后，我们以为内战的威胁已除，从此人民可进入和平建设的坦途。不料国民党反动派背信弃义，撕毁政治协商会议一切决议，特务暴徒到处行凶，并且调集百万大军向解放区疯狂进攻，从华中、华北到东北，到处都弥漫着内战的火焰，人民业已遭受着反动派有计划的屠杀。
    我们起义初衷原为“退出内战拥护民主”，现在反动派既在外国帝国主义分子支援下，再度制造内战破坏民主，我们当义不容辞的坚决站在保卫人民利益的立场，愿与八路军新四军携手并肩，以必死的决心，必胜的信念，为制止内战保卫和平与民主，向进攻解放区的反动派展开神圣的自卫战。
