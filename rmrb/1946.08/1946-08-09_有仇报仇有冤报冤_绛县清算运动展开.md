　　Paying Back Debts of Blood and Settling Grievances
    The Unfolding of the Liquidation Movement in Jiang County
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng News] Before the liberation of Jiang County seat, the people of Jiang County had engaged in a long and arduous struggle against the enemy, puppets, traitors, bullies and landlords. After the county seat was liberated, the mass movement unfolded like a raging fire. When the Japanese bandits surrendered last year, the traitor Chen Ziwen refused to surrender his weapons and intensified his espionage activities, dispatching armed plainclothes agents in groups of two or three every night to carry out assassinations everywhere. At that time, our leading comrades, in this difficult environment, organized the masses to persist in the struggle and assured the masses, "We will share life and death, and we will never retreat!" The morale of the masses was consolidated, and they expressed their determination to fight to the death. In the past year of struggle, they created many self-defense methods, such as: 1. Defending the fortresses: Militiamen and activists would gather in sturdy, good courtyards at night, and weapons would be prepared before sleep. If anything happened, they would go to the roof and throw grenades down. Chen's armed agents were repelled by the masses in this way many times. 2. Repairing walls: Many villages automatically repaired and strengthened their walls, making it impossible for agents to sneak in at night. 3. Organizing joint village defense and combining with the troops to carry out tenacious armed battles. This greatly strengthened the masses' will to fight and confidence in victory, and at the same time gave the cadres great encouragement. On June 20th, we liberated Jiang County seat. The leadership then put forward the slogan "Sow seeds everywhere, grow crops everywhere," "Pay back debts of blood, settle grievances," so that the masses' anger of revenge immediately burned fiercely on a county-wide scale. On the 5th of last month, a mass meeting of ten thousand people in the urban area denounced the heinous crimes of five major traitors, including Cao Tianxiang, and executed them by firing squad on the spot. In the half month since then, ninety villages (half of all the villages in the county) have quickly launched struggles against traitors and bullies, and for rent reduction and debt liquidation. Many village-level regimes controlled by traitors and bullies have been transformed. The land that landlords and local tyrants had mortgaged to farmers at low prices during the enemy and puppet period in order to transfer burdens, with the intention of taking it back at any time, has now been re-established with lease terms of more than five years. For those who farmed to pay grain (ostensibly renting, but in reality all the grain collected was plundered in the name of burden), in addition to some tenants calculating their wages with the landlords as hired laborers, most adopted the method of "rent calculated as rent (according to rent reduction standards), grain payments calculated as grain payments," and settled accounts separately. In villages where the issue of rent and interest has been resolved, the lives of farmers have been improved, their class status is rapidly rising, extreme poverty is tending to be eliminated, the number of poor peasants is decreasing, and the number of middle peasants is rapidly increasing. In Zhengchai, Chaquan, and Fancun villages, the original thirty-one extremely poor households have been reduced to only one; the original ten tenant farmer households have become self-cultivating farmers. The number of middle peasants has increased from the original one hundred and sixty-two to two hundred and thirty-five. The county-wide mass movement is now developing in a comprehensive and in-depth manner.

　　有仇报仇有冤报冤
    绛县清算运动展开
    【本报阳城讯】绛县人民在县城解放之前，曾与敌伪奸霸地主进行了长期的苦斗，县城解放后，群运即如烈火一般的展开。去年日寇投降，汉奸陈子文不肯缴枪，并加紧特务活动，每黑夜三三两两派出武装便衣，到处进行暗杀活动。当时我领导同志在这艰苦环境里组织群众坚持斗争，并向群众保证“同生死、共患难，决不退走！”群众情绪巩固了，表示要誓死奋斗到底。在一年来的斗争中，创造了很多自卫办法，如：一、守堡子：民兵与积极分子晚间集中睡在坚固的好院里，武器都在睡前准备好。一有事就上房往下打手榴弹。陈逆的武装特务，曾多次被群众这样打退。二、修围墙：不少村庄自动把围墙修好，修结实，使特务无法夜间窜入。三、组织联村联防，与部队结合，进行了顽强的武装战斗。大大坚定了群众的斗争意志与胜利信心，同时给了干部以极大鼓舞。六月二十日我解放了绛县城，领导上即提出“到处撒种子、到处长庄稼”、“有仇报仇、有冤报冤”的口号，使群众复仇的怒火立即以全县的规模猛烈燃烧起来。上月五日城关万人大会控诉曹天祥等五个大汉奸的滔天罪行，并当场执行枪决后，半月多来，很快即有九十个村庄（占全县村庄之半）掀起反汉奸、反恶霸与减租清债的斗争。许多汉奸恶霸把持的村级政权被改造了。敌伪时期地主豪绅们为转嫁负担而低价当给农民准备随时夺回的土地，现在都重订了五年以上的典期。以前种地顶粮（表面是租种，实际所收粮食全被以负担名义掠去）的，除部分佃户作为雇工向地主算回工价外，大部采取“租算租（按减租标准）、粮款算粮款”的办法，分头算了账。租息问题已获解决的村庄，农民生活都得到改善，成分在很快上升，赤贫趋向消灭，贫农在减少，中农在迅速增加。郑柴、槎泉、范村等三村，原来三十一户赤贫，现在只剩了一户；原来十户佃农，现在成了自耕农。中农由原来的一百六十二户增至二百三十五户。全县群运，现正向普遍与深入发展中。
