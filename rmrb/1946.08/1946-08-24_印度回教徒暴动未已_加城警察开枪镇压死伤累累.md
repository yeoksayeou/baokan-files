　　加城警察开枪镇压死伤累累
    【新华社延安二十日电】据各通讯社报导：加尔各答回教徒为抗议英国计划而举行的暴动，迄十八日仍未停止，加城已进入戒严并与印度其他各城隔绝。警察奉命向一切出现于街道的人开枪，截至十八日晚已有一千人死亡，四千人受伤。据悉回教徒于十六日的暴动中，曾捣毁英国及印教徒的商店，并在加城与印教徒发生对阵战，街道尸体累累。军警为镇压暴动，曾出动大批装甲车向暴动者开枪。
    【新华社延安十九日电】加尔各答十八日讯：此间英当局十八日发布命令，禁止印度人民五人以上聚会。当此命令尚未向市民宣布前，英军警即向通衢大道上五人同行之市民开枪，顿时秩序大乱。印度人民为制止英军警不法暴行，即采取自卫行动，因而十七日加市格斗至为激烈，死亡二百七十人，受伤一千六百人。
