　　Chiang Kai-shek's forces defy mediation orders
　　Communist representatives of the Xinxiang team remain unfree
　　Chiang's army bombards Xianghe, obstructing team investigation
　　[Our newspaper, Jiaozuo, 22nd] Around the 10th of this month, representatives of the three parties of the Xinxiang team formally received instructions from the Beiping Executive Headquarters to go to the Xiuwu front line to inspect and supervise the restoration of the positions of the Kuomintang and Communist armies as of January 13th. The Communist representative immediately stated that the Kuomintang must lift the restrictions on the freedom of our representatives before the team could exercise its functions. After several days of dispute, the American representative, Brigadier General Barrett, personally met with Wang Zhonglian to discuss the matter. Wang agreed in writing, and at the team meeting on the 13th, the Kuomintang representative also formally agreed to lift the restrictions on the freedom of our representatives. Therefore, the team resolved to order the commanders of both sides to first restore the boundary line as of April 10th at midnight on the 17th, and then restore the positions as of January 13th, and scheduled the team to depart for inspection on the 18th and 19th. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 15th, Wang Zhonglian brazenly refused to fulfill his promise. In a public letter to American representative Brigadier General Barrett, he not only refused to lift all restrictions on our representatives, but also wanted to continue to strengthen the restrictions. Barrett was very indignant about this and immediately reported to the Beiping Executive Headquarters, pointing out: "Chiang's army openly violated Order No. 7 reiterated by the Executive Headquarters, the conflict in northern Henan cannot be stopped, the team cannot exercise its functions, and the Kuomintang government should be fully responsible."
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Xianghe, 22nd] (Delayed) Before the 25th team departed for Xianghe, the agreement on "ceasefire between the two sides during the investigation of the Anping incident" had been shattered by the Kuomintang shells that exploded in Xianghe city. On the 21st, the team arrived in Xianghe. After a day of turbulence, just as they were preparing to rest, the 424th Regiment of the 142nd Division of Chiang's army, which occupied Wangmiao, suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Eighth Route Army's defense area in Mahetun at 11:00 p.m. that night, with gunfire and artillery fire continuing all night. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 22nd, while the team was holding a meeting to question witnesses to the Anping incident, Chiang's army, which occupied the Wangjia Bai area west of Xianghe, suddenly fired artillery shells at Xianghe city, and two shells exploded in the city. The chairman of the meeting, Communist representative Major General Huang Yifeng, immediately suggested stopping the questioning in order to protect the safety of the team members. American representative Major O'Malley also agreed, but Kuomintang representative Zhang Shuheng opposed the proposal. Major General Huang stated that the artillery fire endangered the safety of the team members and hindered the team's work, and the Kuomintang should be fully responsible for it. As of the time of this dispatch, the artillery fire from Chiang's army's attack was still continuing.

　　蒋方违抗调处命令
    新乡小组中共代表仍无自由
    蒋军炮轰香河阻碍小组调查
    【本报焦作二十二日电】本月十日前后，新乡小组三方代表，正式接获北平执行部指令饬赴修武前线视察，监督恢复元月十三日国共两军位置，中共代表当即提出必须国方解除对我方代表自由之限制，始能谈到小组行使其职权。小组经数日之争议，美代表白瑞格亦亲与王仲廉面商，王并已书面答应，十三日小组开会时，国方代表亦正式答应允许解除对我代表自由之限制。因此小组决议命令双方指挥官于十七日午夜先恢复夏四月十日界线，而后恢复元月十三日位置，并定十八、十九两日小组出发视察。孰料十五日晚，王仲廉又悍然不执行诺言，在波致美代表白瑞格之公函中，不但不解除对我代表一切限制，反要继续加强其限制，白对此甚为愤懑，当即报告北平执行部，指出：“蒋军公然违反执行部重申之和字第七号命令，豫北冲突不能制止，小组不能行使职权，应由国民党政府方面完全负责。”
    【新华社香河二十二日电】（迟到）二十五小组出发香河前，关于“在调查安平事件中双方停战”的协议，已为在香河城内爆炸之蒋军炮弹所粉碎。二十一日小组抵香河，经一日颠波，正拟休息，不料侵占王庙之蒋军一四二师四二四团，突于当晚十一时起向马合屯八路军防地猛攻，枪炮彻夜未停。二十二日下午五时许，当小组开会询问安平事件见证人之际，侵占香河西王家摆蒋军，突向香河城发炮，炮弹两枚在城内爆炸。会议主席中共代表黄逸峰少将为维护小组人员安全，当即建议停止询问，美代表马上校亦表赞同，惟蒋方代表张叔衡反对此议，黄少将当表示此项炮火危及小组人员安全及妨碍小组工作之进行，当由国民党方面负其全责。迄发电时为止，蒋军攻击的炮火，仍在继续中。
