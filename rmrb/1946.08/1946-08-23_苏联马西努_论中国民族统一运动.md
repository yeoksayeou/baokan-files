　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th—Moscow Radio commentator Masinu, commenting on China's national unification movement, stated: The Chinese reactionaries have always declared that their policy is to pursue China's unification and "resolve political disputes through political means," but in reality, they are doing everything possible to wage a civil war, deliberately putting forward various unrealizable demands, and shifting their responsibilities onto the Communist Party. After detailing how the Kuomintang reactionaries undermined the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, Masinu pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionaries provoked a civil war even before the War of Resistance Against Japan had ended. However, this time, the Chinese people have the experience of two united fronts and the experience of ten years of civil war and eight years of resistance against Japan. Therefore, the reactionaries' activities have been opposed by the broad masses from the beginning, and the idea of national unity has penetrated deeply into the masses. Masinu stated: Now, the situation of 1935 and 1937 has occurred again. To deceive public opinion at home and abroad, the Kuomintang reactionaries have again declared that their policy principle seems to be "to continue to resolve political disputes through political means." To this end, they have engaged in various tricks, shifting all responsibility onto the Chinese Communist Party and making unrealizable demands on the CCP. Chinese democrats have pointed out that the CCP has made great concessions each time for the sake of peace and unity, but the reactionaries' demands are limitless and would undermine the cause of national construction. Chinese democrats believe that in the War of Resistance Against Japan and National Liberation, the CCP and its People's Revolutionary Army and the Liberated Areas were the main force in the war and the reliable pillar of the nation. Similarly, in the current period of national construction and the implementation of the Three People's Principles, they will also become the reliable pillar of the nation. Masinu concluded: After a year of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people have entered a critical juncture of changing circumstances. The current issues are those of war and peace, democracy and dictatorship, national rejuvenation and colonial oppression. The rise of the movement against civil war and for national unity to strive for peace proves that the Chinese people have chosen their own path.

　　论中国民族统一运动
    【新华社延安廿日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努论中国民族统一运动称：中国反动派一向宣布说他们的政策是追求中国的统一，并“以政治方式解决政治纠纷”，但是在实际上他们却尽一切力量进行内战，故意提出种种不能实现的要求，把自己应负的责任推到共产党的身上。马氏详述了国民党反动派如何破坏了第一次国共合作的史实后，指出抗战尚未结束国民党反动派即挑起了内战，可是在这一次中国人民已有了两次统一战线的经验，有了十年内战八年抗战的经验，因此反动派的活动一开始就遭到了广大群众的反对，民族团结的思想已深入到群众中。马氏称：现在又发生了一九三五、一九三七年的情况，国民党反动派为欺骗中外舆论，又声明说他们的政策原则似乎是“继续用政治方式解决政治纠纷”，他们为此作了各种狡计，将全部责任推到中共身上去，对中共又提出不能实现的要求。中国民主人士指出中共为和平与团结的利益，每次都作了很大让步，可是反动派的要求是远没有限度的，是会使建国事业受到破坏。中国民主人士认为在抗日解放战争中，中共及其人民革命军与解放区是抗战的主力，民族可靠的柱石，同样的，在现在建国时期实行三民主义的事业中，也将成民族可靠的柱石。马氏结论称：经过抗日胜利一年之后，中国人民又进入了时局转变的关头，现在的问题是战争与和平、民主与专政、民族复兴与殖民地压迫的问题，反对内战争取和平的民族统一的运动的兴起，证明中国人民已选定了自己的道路。
