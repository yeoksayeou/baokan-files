　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: London - The British United Nations Association held its first plenary session here starting June 22nd, opposing the international control of atomic energy plan proposed by the United States (Note: The U.S. plan is to establish a committee with full power to control the manufacture and storage of atomic bombs by all countries, and considers the use of atomic energy for industrial production illegal, and removes the veto power in the committee), and supports the Soviet proposal (Note: The Soviet proposal includes two items: one is to prohibit the use, production, and storage of atomic weapons under any circumstances, and to destroy all atomic weapons that have been made or partially made within three months; the other is to establish two committees as subordinate bodies to the Atomic Energy Control Committee to exchange scientific knowledge and prevent the use of atomic energy to harm mankind). The conference expressed regret at the United States' unwillingness to disclose atomic secrets. The chairman of the association is Viscount Cecil, former chairman of the British League of Nations Association. In his speech at the conference, he said: "In today's world, if countries cannot establish an international agreement with the Soviet Union, and establish such an agreement outside the Soviet Union, it would be the greatest misfortune. I hope and believe that this misfortune will not happen. I do not claim to fully understand the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union has many reasons to expect peace."

　　英国联合国组织同志会反对美管制原子能计划
    【新华社延安三日电】伦敦讯：六月二十二日起，英国联合国组织同志会在此间举行第一届全会，反对美国所提国际管制原子能计划（按：美国计划为设立一委员会，不仅有全权管制一切国家之原子弹的制造与保藏，而且认为利用原子能为工业生产之用亦为违法，并在该委员会中取消否决权），赞成苏联提案（按：苏联提案计有两项，其一是在任何情况下，禁止使用生产及保存原子能武器，在三个月内将一切已制成或制成一部分之原子武器全部予以破坏；其二是设立两委员会，作为原子能管制委员会的附属机关，以交换科学知识，并防止利用原子能伤害人类）。大会对美国不愿公开原子秘密表示遗憾。该会主席为前英国国联同志会主席薛西尔子爵，他在大会发表演说称：处今日之世，各国若不能与苏联成立国际协定，而在苏联之外成立此协定，实乃最大不幸之事。我希望并相信此种不幸之事，不致发生，我不自认完全了解苏联，但苏联实有许多理由期望和平。
