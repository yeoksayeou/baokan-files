[Changzhi News] Zhang Yaozhong, a cadre of the Fifth District Cooperative of Pingshun, and Zhang Tingfang, a silversmith, have successfully imitated double-strand steel heddles by hand. These heddles can replace foreign steel heddles (a type of steel needle used on looms to separate warp threads into upper and lower layers, about six or seven inches long, with a hole in the middle, each threaded with a warp thread), and are more suitable for native yarn than imported products, being durable, rust-resistant, and cheaper. They have been widely adopted throughout Pingshun County. Under conditions where purchasing steel heddles is difficult, they have greatly helped the development of the local textile industry. The Administrative Office has specially issued a certificate of merit and a reward of 10,000 yuan, and called on other regions to imitate them. Last winter, due to the difficulty in purchasing steel heddles, Zhang Yaozhong approached Zhang Tingxiu to imitate them. Initially, Tingxiu used four liang of iron and manually drew it into iron wire to try to make them, but failed because the iron wire was too hard and there was no welding lathe. Later, copper wire was used to solve the welding problem, but because the copper wire was difficult to make the same length and not straight, it was difficult to keep the middle hole straight. After many studies, single-strand heddles were made, with a price only a little more than one-third of that of foreign steel heddles. After successful trial use, they were welcomed by the masses and sales were brisk, which further encouraged their determination to make double-strand heddles. After another fifty days of research and a loss of more than 3,700 yuan, not only was the double-strand heddle successfully trial-produced, but a complete set of heddle-making tools was created, including a wire drawing lathe, a welding lathe, a drilling machine, and a heading machine. The technology has also gradually improved, and the middle hole of the heddle is smooth and will never snag the yarn. A small factory has now been set up to manufacture them, producing 1,500 heddles per day. The manufacturing process is as follows: first, thick steel wire or iron wire is drawn into thin wire, and after being burned three or four times, it is immersed in yellow alum liquid to remove rust. Then, the two strands of wire are joined and wound on a welding lathe wheel, and the two wires are tinned and welded at the hole to complete the process.

　　平顺张耀中张廷秀  仿制钢＠成功
    行署特发万元奖励
    【长治讯】平顺五区区联社干部张耀中及银匠张廷芳，手工仿制之双股＠已告成功。此＠可代替外来钢＠（织布机上用以分经线为上下两层之一种钢针，约六、七寸长，中有孔，每根绾经线一条），用于土纱且较舶来品为宜，耐用不锈，价钱便宜，平顺全县已普遍采用。在购买钢＠困难的条件下，对本区纺织业发展帮助很大。行署特颁发奖状及奖金万元，并号召各地仿制。去冬因钢＠购买困难，张耀中即约同张廷秀仿制，最初廷秀以四两铁用手工拔成铁丝试造，结果因铁丝太硬与没有焊车而失败。后改用铜丝，解决了焊结问题，但因铜丝长短难齐和不直。中孔很难留正，又经多次研究始造成单股＠，价格仅及外来钢＠的三分之一强。经试用成功，群众欢迎，销路畅旺，这更鼓励了他们造双股＠的决心。又经五十天的研究，赔本三千七百余元，不仅双股＠试造成功，并创造了一全套造＠工具，包括拔丝车、焊丝车、钻孔机、上头机等，技术亦逐渐提高，＠中孔光滑，绝不挂纱。现已设有小型工厂制造，日出一千五百根。制造过程为：先将粗钢丝或铁丝拔成细丝，经火烧三、四次后浸入黄矾液中去锈，然后将两股丝并缠于焊车轮上将两丝留孔上锡焊好即成。
