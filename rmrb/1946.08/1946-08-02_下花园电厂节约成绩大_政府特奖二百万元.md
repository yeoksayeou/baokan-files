    [Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 28th] The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee recently decided to award two million yuan to all workers of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant in recognition of their achievements in conserving fuel and using substitutes. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, the average annual coal waste per person in the power plant was more than 70 or 80 tons. Since liberation, due to improved living standards and enhanced social status, workers have also come to love the liberated areas and care about the factory. Technicians in the plant have researched with great enthusiasm, saving fuel expenses and trying out substitutes from all aspects. The phenomenon of waste has been greatly reduced. In June alone, more than 23 million yuan in fuel expenses was saved.
