    If the three hundred million U.S. dollars that the heads of the Kuomintang reactionaries have deposited in American banks were brought back, they would be worth 600,000,000,000 yuan in legal tender (here, it is temporarily calculated at 2,000 yuan of national currency per U.S. dollar, which is already more than this amount). If they were all one-yuan legal tender notes, then its measures would be as follows:
    1. Length: If all the one-yuan banknotes were connected, they would be 60,000,000 kilometers long, enough to pave all the railways and highways in our country (highways calculated at 5 meters wide) into railways and highways paved with banknotes. If they were stacked up, they would be 400,000 kilometers high, requiring 13,333 airplanes to hold a relay ascending flight, and only the highest plane could exceed their height.
    2. Volume: Every 500,000 yuan in banknotes occupies one cubic meter of space, so 600,000,000,000 yuan would occupy 1,200,000 cubic meters; to store them in a building, it would take thirteen large rooms to hold them.
    3. Weight: At one kilogram per thousand yuan, the total weight is 600,000,000 kilograms. If the world's most heavily loaded four-ton trucks were used to transport them, it would take 133,333 trucks to move them all. If people were to carry them, it would take 13,333,333 young and strong people. (calculated at 45 kilograms per person)
    Furthermore, if a single person were dedicated to counting the number of bills, it would take 317,091 years, and they would have to work non-stop 24 hours a day. If all the young bank employees in China (all young men around twenty years old), a total of 17,838 people, were mobilized to work eight hours a day (but during the extraordinary period of counting banknotes, of course, even commemorative days, holidays, and any vacations, sick leave... would all be waived), counting the banknotes one by one, by the time this amount was counted, these twenty thousand young men would all have become old men over sixty years old.
    Not far from here, in Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi, the famine is now severe. The number of famine victims in Henan has increased from 8.2 million in May to over 14.2 million recently; the total number of disaster victims in Hunan Province has reached 30 million; Jiangxi has 13 million disaster victims; out of the 14 million people in Guangxi Province, 13 million have no food to eat! The Kuomintang reactionaries have not used a single yuan of their deposits in the United States to relieve these people who have endured eight years of war against Japan, let alone that, but now, on the contrary, they are stepping up the collection of grain and money in these areas, using the grain that the people have exchanged for selling their children to support the army fighting the civil war.

　　度量衡
    老田
    如果把国民党反动派的几个头子存在美国银行的三万万美金提回来，共值法币六○○、○○○、○○○、○○○元（这里暂以每元美金折合国币二千元计，现在已不止这个数目）。倘若都是一元法币的话，那么它的度量衡是这样的：
    一、度：将全部一元钞票连接起来，可长达六○、○○○、○○○公里，可以将我国所有的铁路和公路（公路以五公尺宽计算）都铺成钞票铺起来的铁路和公路。如果把它叠起来，可高达四○○、○○○公里，这样就需要一万三千三百三十三架飞机，举行接力升高飞行，到最高一架，才可以超过它们的高度呢。
    二、量：每五○○、○○○元钞票可占一立方公尺的面积，六○○、○○○、○○○、○○○元则共占一、二○○、○○○立方公尺；要往大楼里装，要十三大间才可以装得下。
    三、衡：以每千元一公斤计，全重是六○○、○○○、○○○公斤，假如用世界上最能载重的四吨载重汽车来运，要一三三、三三三辆车才能把它运走。倘若用人去担，那非要动员年轻力壮的一三、三三三，三三三人不行。（以每人能担九十斤算）
    再呢，假如专门用一个人去点清他的数目，那么要花三一七、○九一年，而且还得每天不停的工作二十四小时。如果动员全中国各银行的青年行员（都是二十岁左右的年轻小伙子）共一七、八三八人，每日工作八小时（但当点数钞票的非常时期，当然连纪念日，例假以及什么休假，病假……也一概从免），一元一元的数去，等到点清这个数目时，这两万个年轻小伙子都已变成六十岁以上的老头儿了。
    离我们这里不远的河南、江西、湖南、广西这些地方，如今灾荒正严重。河南的饥民数目，已经从五月间的八百二十万，增加到最近的一千四百二十多万；湖南全省灾民，到了三千万；江西灾民一千三百万；广西全省人口一千四百万当中，就有一千三百万人没有饭吃！国民党反动派没有动用一元在美国的存款，来救济这些抗战八年的老百姓，这且不讲，现在，反转在这些地方，加紧催粮催款，拿老百姓卖儿卖女换来的粮食，供养打内战的军队。
