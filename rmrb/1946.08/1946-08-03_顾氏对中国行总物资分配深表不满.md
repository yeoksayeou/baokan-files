　　Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 31st — UNRRA agricultural specialist Gu Xibo and social welfare specialist Lai Hengli, along with three doctors from the UNRRA health team including Ding Jiexing, arrived in Huimin, in the Bohai Liberated Area, on the afternoon of the 13th, carrying a portion of relief supplies. This reporter visited Mr. Gu and Mr. Lai. According to them, this trip was to transport UNRRA materials, establish contact between UNRRA and the Bohai region, and investigate agriculture and disaster conditions. The materials they carried included 2,500 tons of white flour, 27 boxes of medicine, 20 barrels of gasoline, 50 iron shovels, and 227 sacks. A portion has already been transported to Yangjiaolu (under the jurisdiction of Shouguang County) for unloading. These materials are specifically for Yellow River conservancy relief. Mr. Gu expressed deep dissatisfaction with the poor organization of UNRRA's distribution of materials. He cited an example: "I saw twelve starving disaster victims on a highway in Guangxi, while the warehouses there were filled with UNRRA flour that had not been distributed." Mr. Gu believes that UNRRA's allocation of materials to the Liberated Areas is extremely unfair. He said, "In the Communist areas of Shandong, the population accounts for 80 to 85 percent of the province, while the Kuomintang areas account for 15 to 20 percent, but the distribution of materials is in inverse proportion. UNRRA has protested to the Kuomintang authorities several times regarding this unreasonable distribution." Mr. Lai continued, saying that the main reason why materials cannot be transported to the Liberated Areas is the military blockade by the Kuomintang authorities. Mr. Gu and Mr. Lai were greatly impressed by the active and diligent production of men and women along the way during their trip to the Liberated Areas, and the harmonious and close relationship between the government and the people. Both believe that this is rare in other parts of China.

　　顾氏对中国行总物资分配深表不满
    【新华社惠民三十一日电】联总农业整理员顾希伯、社会福利专员赖恒立两氏，偕同行总卫生组丁节祥等三大夫携带救济物资一部，于十三日下午抵渤海解放区的惠民。记者趋访顾赖二氏，据称：此行为运送联总物资，与建立联总与渤海区的联系与调查农业及受灾等情况，所携物资计白面二千五百吨，药品廿七箱，汽油二十桶，铁铲五十把及麻袋二百二十七个，一部已运至羊角路（寿光县属）卸运中。此项物资专作黄河河工救济之用。顾氏对行总散发物资机构之不良，深表不满，他举例说：“我曾在广西的公路上，看到饿死的灾民十二人，而那里仓库中却堆满了联总面粉没有发。”顾氏认为行总对解放区物资的分配极不公平，他说：“在山东中共地区人口占全省百分之八十到八十五，国民党地区占百分之十五到廿，而物资的分配却成反比例，联总对此种不合理分配，曾数次向国民党当局提出抗议。”赖氏继称：物资之所以不能运来解放区，主要原因是国民党当局的军事封锁所致。顾赖二氏此次来解放区以沿途所见男女积极勤劳生产，政府与人民关系和谐密切，印象极佳，两氏认为此为中国其他地区所罕见。
