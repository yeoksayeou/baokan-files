Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: According to comprehensive reports from Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao: The people's uprising in the Tongjiang, Nanbu, and Bazhong areas of northern Sichuan Province, which began in May, has now become a prairie fire. Most villages and towns in Tong, Nan, and Ba have been occupied by armed uprising forces. Tongjiang city was also surrounded in early July, and transportation was cut off. As of late July, the situation in the city was unclear. The Wangcang uprising forces engaged in battle with the security team and have occupied the entire forest area. There are many rebels in Chong Qing and Gu Lin counties, and they have a large number of weapons such as machine guns. Although heavy troops are stationed in Zhongjiang city to suppress the situation, the situation remains extremely unstable. Alarms are also frequently reported in the four rural areas of Leshan, Anyue, Lezhi, Emei, Luxian, Xinfan, and Pengxian. The Kuomintang authorities are attempting to suppress the uprising and have issued orders to all counties to implement "joint defense and suppression."
