The People Who Turned Over
　　Cheng Fang

　　In the height of summer, I arrived at Qingyan Temple, a remote village in the northwest corner of Wu'an County.

　　The village's chest is adorned with shady green orchards and lush vegetable gardens, with a perennial stream flowing through it. Its back is closely nestled against layers of green fields. The pleasant mood and cheerful smiles of the villagers present a youthful scene of Qingyan Temple!

　　During the busy farming season, the enthusiasm of the emancipated people for production is very high. They go to the fields to weed before dawn and do not return from the fields in groups of three or five, singing songs, until the sun rolls down the western mountains. As soon as they put down their rice bowls, they review the day's production. Although they are so busy, they do not show any signs of fatigue.

　　One evening, I met the newly appointed village chief, Li Guorui. He has a very good understanding of the tragic lives of the peasants. During the rent reduction and debt liquidation movement in February of this year, he actively led the masses to settle accounts with the local tyrants and landlords, removing the thousand-pound stone slab that was pressing on the masses. At the village government re-election meeting in April, the whole village unanimously elected him as the village chief, supporting him to work for them. Now he happily sings about the great emancipation of the people:

　　"On the thirteenth of February,
　　The rent reduction movement was in full swing,
　　The tenants, held a meeting,
　　Complained of their sufferings and aired their grievances,
　　Overthrowing feudal heavy exploitation,
　　And lifting this big stone slab!
　　Redeemed the estates and took back the land,
　　Then harvested a good May crop,
　　Improving the lives of every household;
　　Mutual aid production is not difficult,
　　Organized together to work with one heart!"

　　Indeed, the thirteenth of February, this day of emancipation, is forever unforgettable in the hearts of the folks in Qingyan Temple. On this day, Worker Wang from the district led the tenants to hold an emancipation meeting. At the meeting, Old Lady Wang tearfully recounted the tragic situation of her husband being forced to death by the landlord Wang Xingde. She said, "Our family was forced to beg for food by Wang Xingde. His father wanted an ear of sorghum, but Wang Xingde insisted that he stole it from him, fined us in the village, and sent him to Wu'an City to be imprisoned. His father died in prison like that...." She suffered a relapse of her long-standing heartache while recounting, and lost her voice and fell to the ground. "How many good people like this have been killed by man-eating evil landlords!" Angry voices and tears of sympathy were heard throughout the venue, igniting the flames of revenge. After this rent reduction and grievance meeting, the tenants lifted the stone slab, turned over, had land to cultivate, had good houses to live in, and spent this good May of this year. Really, thinking about the past and looking at the present, how could they not be happy!

　　Liu Shouxiang, the vice chairman of the farmers' association, was a long-term worker for more than thirty years who had suffered greatly. In his past life, he had experienced the hardships of the world and suffered all kinds of sorrows and pains. Since the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, he has been freed from his life as a long-term worker and established his own family. After this year's rent reduction movement, he truly turned over, acquired an estate, and bought land. In May, he harvested more than four stones of wheat, leaping from extreme poverty to being a middle peasant. This is the first time in his life. His enthusiasm for production is particularly high this year, and he works in the fields all day, not returning until dark.

　　When I met him again, he opened his toothless mouth and said bluntly, "We have good houses to live in now! Come and sit at home!" Yes, the two small houses he used to live in were dark and gloomy, like a prison. As soon as you entered the door, you felt like you were entering a prison. Now let him sing for his new times! "I've lived for more than forty years, and I haven't lived through this year's time yet. I have an estate, I have land, and I've harvested the May crop, and I've eaten new wheat white flour!" He warmly shook my hand, talking and laughing, laughing so hard that he couldn't close his toothless mouth.

　　"The production in this street is very vigorous this year!" He went on to say: "The men have joined the mutual aid groups, and the enthusiasm for production organized together is particularly great. One person can hoe more than one mu a day. We have hoeed our own land, and we have also mobilized the mutual aid group to sell labor to hoe the land of poor, widowed families and families of soldiers. We know the suffering of the poor, and we also know the difficulty of not having manpower, so we don't teach people to run around looking for people to make trouble. There is not a single person who doesn't move in this street this year, and there is not a single mu of wasteland." He is so diligent, busy all day long and unwilling to be idle; he is so sincere to others, knowing his own difficulties, and also being able to empathize with the difficulties of others. He always remembers that he is the leader of the masses and wants to work for the masses!

　　The scorching sun is overhead. I walked north along the edge of the garden in front of the village, following the murmuring stream, winding and winding, and happened to walk to the land of the emancipated peasant Wang Heiyi. Old Wang was watering the land with a seventeen or eighteen-year-old youth in this garden that grows onions, garlic, chives... I saw his shiny back, his bronze-like arms, forgetting the heat and fatigue, and couldn't help saying, "Old Wang, you are going to be a labor hero!"

　　"Since I turned over in the spring, I have been busy in the field," he said happily. "This is the land of Wang Gaoqiu that I bought for five thousand yuan. In those days when it was dry, I was afraid that the garlic seedlings would die of drought, so I watered the land all night long. Look at this red-skinned garlic that grows like an apple!" He pulled one out and showed it to me. Turning his face, he put his hand with five fingers together on his waist, making gestures and said: "The wheat in May grew to waist-deep, and I was looking forward to eating good wheat after fertilizing, but it rained for several days in a row, and it was all jaundiced, and I harvested more than half less. But even so, I harvested more than five stones this year, including dry land and paddy field, and two people can't finish eating it." Since Old Wang turned over, he no longer has to worry about eating one meal and not having the next.

　　The people who turned over in Qingyan Temple all participated in production, and many people are organized in mutual aid groups. The men's hoes make a loud noise in the fields, and the women's spinning wheels hum at home. It is truly "men plowing and women weaving," a scene of production!

　　They turned over and became wealthy, and lived a good life. They have not forgotten who gave them this time. They are always talking about: Chairman Mao called us to live a good time, to live a happy life, and we want to thank Chairman Mao. The Eighth Route Army drove away the devils and protected our homes. We must support the Eighth Route Army. The people who have turned over are all singing for their free and happy lives. In their songs of emancipation, we can often hear:

　　"The Communist Party, for the people,
　　Rent reduction and interest reduction turned us over,
　　Making our time beautiful,
　　Even more caring than our parents;
　　Support Chairman Mao,
　　Support the Eighth Route Army,
　　Turning over and not forgetting the Communist Party,
　　Drinking water and not forgetting the well-digger!"

　　Si Liu·Ba·Yi·

　　翻了身的人们
　　成坊
    盛夏，我到了武安县西北角的偏僻村庄——青烟寺。
    这个村的胸前，是荫绿的果树林，青葱的菜园地；常年不断的溪流。脊背紧靠着层层叠叠碧绿的田野。村人的愉快心情和欢悦的笑脸，呈现着青烟寺的青春景象！
    农忙时节，翻身人们的生产劲头是很大的，他们天不亮就上地锄苗，直到太阳滚下西山，才三五一伙的，唱着歌子，从地里回来，刚一放下饭碗，便又检讨一天的生产。虽然这样忙碌，可是他们并没表现出疲倦的神色。
    一个傍晚，我会见了新任村长李国瑞。他对农民的悲惨生活是十分了解的，今年二月的减租清债运动中，他积极领导群众向恶霸地主算账，揭掉了压在群众身上的千斤石板。在四月的村政改选大会上，全村人一致选举他当村长，拥护他替自己办事，现在他高兴的歌唱着人民的大翻身：
    “二月十三那一天，
    减租运动大开展，
    佃户们，开大会，
    诉了苦，伸了冤，
    打倒了封建重剥削，
    掀了这块大石板！
    赎了庄子抽回地，
    接着收了个好五月，
    家家生活都改善；
    互助生产不费难，
    组织起来齐心干！”
    的确，二月十三这个翻身的日子，在青烟寺老乡们的心里，是永远难忘的。这天，区上的王工作员领导佃户开了翻身大会。在会上，王老太太痛哭流涕的诉说着她男人叫地主王兴德逼死的惨痛情形，她说：“俺一家人叫王兴德逼的讨吃要饭，他爹要了一穗高粱，王兴德硬说是偷的他的，在村上把俺罚了，还送到武安城叫坐监，他爹就这样生生的死在监牢里………。”她诉着久积的心痛病就发作了，一时失声倒地。“这样的好人，不知叫吃人的恶地主害死了多少！”全场的人发出了愤怒的声音，落下了同情的眼泪，燃起了复仇烈火。经过这天的减租诉苦大会，佃户们才掀了石板，翻了身，有了地种，有了好房子住，才过上今年的好五月。真是，想过去，看现在，该不高兴哩！
    农会副主席刘守祥是住了三十多年长工的受苦人。在他那过去的生涯里，饱尝世路风霜，尽受辛酸痛苦。自从八路军来了以后，他才摆脱了常年的长工生活，建立起自己的家务来。经过今年的减租运动，他真正翻身了，置了庄子，买了地。五月收了四石多麦子，由赤贫而一跃为中农了。这是他半辈子的第一遭。他的生产劲头比往年特别大，一天在地里做活，不到天黑不回来。
    当我和他重逢时，他张着缺齿的嘴，劈头第一句就说：“咱可有好房子住啦！快去家坐坐吧！”是的，他过去住的那两间小屋，又暗又黑，真像一座监房，人一进门，就有进了囹圄的感觉。现在让他为他的新时光而歌唱吧！“咱活了四十多岁，还没过过今年的时光哩，有了庄子，有了地，又收了五月，新麦白面也吃上啦！”他亲热的握着我的手，说着笑着，笑的他闭不上他那缺齿的嘴巴。
    “这街今年的生产可有劲啦！”他紧接着说：“男人们参加了互助组，组织起来的生产劲头特别大，一个人一天能锄一亩多。俺们自己的地锄了，还动员互助组卖工，把贫苦孤寡人家和抗属的地也给锄过了。咱知道穷人的苦，也知道没人手的难处，就不教人家东跑西跑觅人作难。这街今年没有一个不动弹的人，没有一亩荒地。”他是那样的勤劳，一天忙忙碌碌不肯闲；是那样的诚恳对人，知道自己的难处，也能体贴到别人的困难。他时时刻刻记着是群众的领袖，要为群众办事啊！
    炎日正中，我沿着村前的园圃地边，顺着潺潺溪岸，湾湾曲曲地往北走去，可恰走到翻身农民王黑义的地边。老王正在这块长着葱、蒜，韭菜……的园地里，同一个十七八岁的青年绞着辘辘浇地哩！我看到他那油润发光的脊背，青铜似的臂膀，忘了热和疲惫的神情，不由得说：“老王，要当劳动英雄啦！”
    “春天翻身后，咱在地里一直受的没闲，”他高兴的说：“这是五千块钱买的王高秋的地。正在天旱的那几天，光怕旱死蒜苗，咱连夜浇地。你看咱这红皮蒜长的跟苹果一样！”他随手拔了一头给我看。转过脸，他五指并拢的把手摆在腰间，做着手势说：“五月麦子长的拦腰深，眼看着养罢花就要吃好麦子啦，一连下了几天雨，都给黄疸啦，少收一半还多。就这吧，咱今年连旱地带水地一共收了五石多，两个人可吃不清。”老王自翻身后，再不愁吃了上顿没下顿啦。
    青烟寺翻了身的人们，个个都参加了生产，许多人组织在互助组里。男人的锄头在地里吃喇喇响，女人的纺车在家里嗡嗡叫，真是“男耕女织”，一片生产景象！
    他们翻身发了家，过了好时光，他们没有忘了这种时光是谁给的。他们时刻在谈论：毛主席叫咱的时光过好，过快活日子，咱们要感谢毛主席。八路军把鬼子打走了，才保住咱的家，咱要拥护八路军。翻了身的人们都在为自己的自由幸福的生活而歌唱着。在他们翻身的歌声里，我们常常可以听到：
    “共产党，为人民，
    减租减息翻了身，
    叫咱时光过的美，
    倒比父母对咱还关心；
    拥护毛主席，
    拥护八路军，
    翻身不忘共产党，
    吃水不忘掏井人！”
                                    四六·八·一·
