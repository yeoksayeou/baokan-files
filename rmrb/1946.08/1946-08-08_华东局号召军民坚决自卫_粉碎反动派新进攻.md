　　Xinhua News Agency, LinYi, 5th: The East China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, in view of the fact that the Kuomintang reactionaries are launching a nationwide civil war and expanding their offensive against the Su-Wan and Shandong liberated areas, issued the "Letter to Compatriots and Comrades on Thoroughly Crushing the Offensive of the Kuomintang Reactionaries and Striving for Victory in the Second Self-Defense War" on August 1st, calling on the military and civilians in the entire East China liberated area to mobilize and crush the reactionaries' offensive. The document first pointed out that in order to achieve the happiness of the people in the liberated areas, the survival of compatriots in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, and to defend China's independence, peace, and democracy, it is necessary to resolutely defend ourselves and crush the reactionaries' offensive. It then put forward the current urgent tasks to the military and civilians in the entire East China liberated area: (1) Expand the patriotic united front, unite all peace-loving and democratic friendly army officers and soldiers, democratic figures, and compatriots across the country to fight against Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and traitorous policies! (2) Call on the vast number of officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang army to refuse internal war orders and stand on the side of the people; learn from the example of Generals Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, Liu Shanben and others! (3) All commanders and fighters of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army! Fight bravely, create combat heroes, and seize the Chiang army's American-equipped equipment to arm yourselves. Treat Kuomintang officers and soldiers who lay down their weapons with leniency, and warmly welcome and assist friendly troops who revolt. (4) Local armed forces should assist the main force in combat, and the main force should lead the militia to launch extensive guerrilla warfare. (5) All 1.5 million militiamen in East China should go to the front line to cooperate with the regular army in combat, and go to areas occupied by the Chiang army to help the people launch guerrilla warfare and sparrow warfare, capture armed Kuomintang secret agents, crack down on Chiang army troops who rob grain, protect the people's lives and property, protect the fruits of the people's liberation, and cooperate with the army to recapture towns, villages, railways, and mines occupied by the Chiang army. Those remaining in the rear should help self-defense forces stand guard, arrest spies, and consolidate the rear. (6) All the masses, working cadres, members of workers', peasants', youth, and women's organizations, and staff members of governments at all levels should help the people in the newly liberated areas quickly turn over, carry out large-scale production movements, further improve the people's lives, and ensure support for the front lines; personnel working in the war zone should organize the people to assist the army in a planned way. (7) Logistics personnel, technicians, and nurses should improve work efficiency and ensure various needs on the self-defense war front. (8) All cultural workers should go to the front lines! Go to the masses! Use pens, songs, and dramas to expose the crimes of the reactionaries, inspire the people's will to defend themselves, and promote the people's art of struggle. Finally, it called on all Communist Party members in the East China liberated area to become models in completing the above tasks and to carry forward revolutionary heroism!
