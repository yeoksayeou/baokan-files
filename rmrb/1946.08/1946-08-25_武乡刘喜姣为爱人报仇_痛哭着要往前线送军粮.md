　　Wu Xiang Liu Xijiao Seeks Revenge for Her Lover, Weeping and Insisting on Sending Military Provisions to the Front Lines

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Liu Xijiao, a female student from the Fourth High School in Wu Xiang, was too weak to join the other students in transporting grain to the front lines. She insisted on going, but the headmaster dissuaded her. She cried, weeping sadly, and said, "My lover sacrificed his life on the Baijin Line to defend peace. Am I not even allowed to send grain to the front lines?" Public hatred and personal vengeance stabbed at her heart like sharp blades, causing hot tears to stream down her face uncontrollably. She felt that not being able to send grain was a failure to fulfill her responsibility, a source of deep shame. Her lover was a political instructor in the 500th Regiment. After the ceasefire order, he was stationed in Lucun on the Baijin Line. The Yan army violated the order and attacked them in breach of the agreement. He restrained his troops, forbidding them from firing, and braved the rain of bullets to step forward, shouting to reason with the Yan army and negotiate. The brutal and unscrupulous Yan army shot and killed him, and after his death, they stabbed him several times with bayonets. Before leaving, the Yan army even cut off his ears.

　　武乡刘喜姣为爱人报仇  痛哭着要往前线送军粮
    【本报讯】武乡四高校女生刘喜姣，在学生们给前线运粮时，她身子软，不能去，但她硬要挣扎去，校长劝了她一顿，没让她去，她哭了，哭的很伤心说：“我的爱人，在白晋线为了保卫和平，牺牲了自己的生命，我连粮也不能给前线送吗？”公仇私恨，像利刃一样的，直刺中她的心头，使热泪止不住的夺眶奔流着，她觉得不能去送粮，是自己未尽到责任，简直是一种羞愧。按她的爱人，是五○○部队的一个指导员，停战令后，他在白晋线的鲁村住，阎军违令毁约向他们进攻，他约束部队，不准开枪，自己冒枪林弹雨，上前喊叫，与阎军说理、交涉，残暴无耻的阎军把他枪杀了，死后，还被通了几刺刀，阎军临走，还割掉他的耳朵。
