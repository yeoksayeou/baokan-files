Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Shanghai dispatch: Prominent figures in cultural circles in Shanghai, including Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Hong Shen, Ye Shengtao, Zhou Jianren, Xu Guangping, Zheng Zhenduo, Tian Han, Hu Feng, Ba Jin and others, jointly wrote to the United Nations Human Rights Commission on July 19, requesting that an investigation team be sent to China to investigate the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo by Nationalist secret agents. The letter pointed out that under the Kuomintang authorities' reign of terror, freedom of thought and speech in China is facing the threat of being wiped out by violence. It also stated: the leaders of the Democratic League were killed by "silent pistols," which in China, were only given to the Chinese government's secret service by the U.S. War Operations Department during the war.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Nanjing dispatch: The Democratic League's request to the Nationalist government to send representatives to Kunming to investigate the Li and Wen assassination case has been unreasonably rejected by the Nationalist authorities.
