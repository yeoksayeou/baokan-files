　　The First Medical Team of the Health Bureau
    Achieves Remarkable Results in Serving the People
    [Handan News] The First Medical Team of the Health Bureau of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, led by Dr. Li Youlin, went to work in the Second District of Handan with the emancipation work team two days ago. In the past fifty days, in addition to ensuring the health of the comrades in the emancipation work team, they have also treated the masses. To date, they have treated more than 380 people. Once, an old man in Nanwenzhuang was injured by a grenade. It was raining, and Dr. Li went to treat him in the rain. They are all good at acupuncture, and many old villagers' chronic diseases, such as hemiplegia, have been quickly cured by acupuncture. Yang Chunren of Jia Dyke’s only son accidentally detonated a grenade while playing, and all five fingers of his left hand were broken. After their treatment, the child was able to work in less than ten days. Yang Chunren was as happy as the other recovered villagers, and gratefully told everyone he met, "The public hospital is truly a life-saving benefactor! They treat us without asking for money. Where can you find such a good thing!" Recently, the medical team received a large batch of mixed vaccine against cholera, typhoid, and dysentery from the Health Bureau and has been giving free injections to the masses and primary school students. In one week, they have injected 567 people. In addition, the medical team also gives hygiene knowledge lessons to the Hesha Town Primary School, conducts social hygiene surveys, studies folk hygiene habits, investigates the types of rural diseases and infant mortality rates, and the activities of witch doctors in rural areas. Preliminary materials have been sent back to the Health Bureau. (Leng Bing)

　　卫生局第一医疗队
    服务群众成绩卓著
    【邯郸讯】晋冀鲁豫边区卫生局第一医疗队，在李友林医生率领下，于两日前随翻身队赴邯郸二区工作。五十天来，除保证翻身队同志健康外，他们还为群众治病，迄今经他们治疗者已有三百八十余人。有一次，南文庄一老乡被手榴弹炸伤，正值下雨，李医生冒雨前去诊治。他们都善长针灸，不少老乡多年来的痼疾如半身不遂等都很快地针灸好了。夹堤杨春仁的独子因玩手榴弹不慎爆炸，左手五指全部破裂，经他们治疗，不到十天，小孩子已能劳动。杨春仁高兴得和其他病愈的老乡一样，逢人就感激的说：“公家医院真是救命恩人！给我们治病也不要钱。那里有这样的好事呀！”最近，医疗队又从卫生局领取了大批霍乱、伤寒、赤痢混合液防疫苗，大量为群众以及小学生免费注射，计一礼拜来，已注射五百六十七人。除此，该医疗队并给河沙镇小学上卫生常识课，作社会卫生调查，研究民间卫生习惯，调查农村疾病种类及婴儿死亡率，巫神在农村的活动等等，初步材料已寄回卫生局。（冷冰）
