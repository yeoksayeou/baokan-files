　　Broad Middle Peasants Participate in Struggle
    Anyang Mass Movement Re-Launched
    Over 100,000 People Involved, Traitorous Landlords and Local Bullies Bow Their Heads in Admission
    [This newspaper Anyang News] The Anyang mass movement had achieved considerable success in the past six months, but due to some errors in the policy towards middle peasants, the interests of middle peasants were harmed in the movement, which prevented the movement from developing more deeply and universally. At the end of June, the county held a county-wide meeting of activists and made a deep self-criticism, explicitly proposing the policy of uniting the entire peasant class to attack the feudal groups, and a large-scale liquidation movement was re-launched. In just fifteen days to mid-July, a total of 69 villages had been mobilized, and 102 villages were in the process of taking action or brewing. Because the issue of unity between middle and poor peasants was resolved, the broad middle peasants participated in the movement, and in many villages, more than 80% of households participated in the struggle, involving more than 100,000 people. In Fucheng, 840 out of 932 households participated in complaining and liquidation. The peasant associations have been universally expanded in the movement, and the broad middle peasants have actively participated. According to statistics from 32 villages, the peasant association members have newly developed 3,377 households, and 943 new activists have emerged. Under the powerful strength of the unity of middle and poor peasants, the feudal groups that were not completely crushed in the previous movement were crushed, and many traitors, secret agents, and landlord bullies bowed their heads and admitted their past exploitation crimes in the face of the mighty peasant masses, saying that they were "dark-hearted" and "enriched themselves by killing poor people." In Fucheng, seven or eight hundred people demanded all 16,000 shi of grain that should be returned in two days and one night. The peasants excitedly said everywhere, "This is true liberation."

　　广大中农参加斗争
    安阳群运重新展开
    十余万人卷入运动汉奸恶霸低头认错
    【本报安阳讯】安阳群众运动，半年以来，曾取得相当成绩，但因对中农政策上犯了一些错误，运动中损害了中农利益，致使运动未能更深入普遍的开展。六月底县里召开全县积极分子会议作了深刻检讨，明确提出团结整个农民阶级向封建集团进攻的方针，大规模的清算运动即又重新展开。至七月中旬短短的十五天之内，计已有六十九村运动起来，有一百零二村正在行动与酝酿中。由于中贫农团结问题得到解决，广大中农参加运动，好多村庄百分之八十以上户数都参加斗争，卷入运动的共十几万人。阜城九百三十二户中，即有八百四十户参加了诉苦和清算。运动中农会普遍扩大，广大中农积极参加，据三十二村统计，农会会员即新发展三千三百七十七户，并涌现出新积极分子九百四十三人。在中贫农团结的强大力量下，上次运动未完全摧垮的封建集团被摧垮了，许多汉奸、特务、恶霸地主都在声势浩大的农民群众面前低头认错，承认自己过去的剥削罪恶，说自己是“按的黑心”“杀害穷人富了自己”。阜城群众七八百人在两天一夜中将应退的一万六千石粮食全部要出。农民们到处兴奋的说：“这才是真翻了身”。
