Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Paris - The Paris Peace Conference plenary session resumed yesterday. The first speaker at the morning session was the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Manuilsky, who condemned the British delegation's attempt to force the Paris Conference to act; and criticized Benes' reserved attitude on the issue of procedural rules. Manuilsky strongly stated that Benes' reservation was unfounded because there was no insertion of reservation language by the American side in the full text of the rules suggested by the Council of Foreign Ministers, which was distributed before the Paris Conference convened. The representative of Byelorussia supported the Soviet Union's position in his speech, demanding that the British reservation be dispelled, calling it a "mistake that must be corrected." Subsequently, Benes and others delivered speeches. After the speeches, the plenary session held a vote. The Soviet Union's proposal to adhere to the voting rules proposed by the Council of Foreign Ministers was rejected by fifteen votes to six. Last night, Foreign Minister Molotov hosted a reception for the delegations to the Paris Peace Conference at the Soviet Embassy. British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived in Paris on the same evening, taking over as the head of the British delegation to the conference.

    关于程序规则问题            
    曼努意斯基批评贝纳斯立场
    【新华社延安十日电】巴黎讯：巴黎和会全体大会于昨日续开，上午的会议中第一个发言人为乌克兰首席代表曼努意斯基，曼氏谴责英国代表团企图强制巴黎会议行事；并批评贝纳斯在程序规则问题上采取保留态度的立场。曼氏力称：贝纳斯的保留是毫无根据的。因为在巴黎会议开会之前所分发的外长会议所建议的规则的全文中，美国方面并无插入保留的语句。白俄罗斯代表在发言中支持苏联的主张，要求打消英国的保留案，称之为“必须纠正的错误”。其后贝纳斯等发表演说，在演说之后全会举行表决，苏联关于坚持外长会议所提表决规则的主张，以十五票对六票遭否决。昨日晚外长莫洛托夫于苏联大使馆招待巴黎和会各代表团。英外相贝文于同晚到达巴黎，接任英国出席和会代表团团长。
