Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th. Following the breakdown of negotiations between the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army and the government on the 17th, according to an Associated Press reporter on the 22nd from Central Luzon, the People's Anti-Japanese Army is resisting the attacks of the Philippine Constabulary and regular army in three provinces in Central Luzon. The Philippine Constabulary is using American-made artillery, and the fighting is extremely fierce. The village of San Julian in Cabiao was bombarded by artillery for one hour and twenty minutes. In a village in Nueva Ecija province, the People's Anti-Japanese Army repelled over seventy attacks by the Constabulary. In other areas, the People's Anti-Japanese Army is conducting flexible guerrilla warfare, repeatedly inflicting casualties on the invaders. The peasant masses, relying on mountains and swamps, are assisting the People's Anti-Japanese Army in guerrilla warfare. It is reported that since the liberation of the Philippines, the People's Anti-Japanese Army, despite being heavily encircled, suppressed and persecuted by the American and Philippine armies, has continued to grow in strength. This is because their leadership in the struggle against landlords restoring oppression has won the support of the broad masses of the people.

    【新华社延安廿四日电】菲人民抗日军十七日与政府的谈判破裂后，据美联社记者二十二日自中吕宋报导，民抗军正在吕宋中部三个省内反抗菲宪兵与正规军的进攻。菲宪兵使用美制大炮，战事极为激烈。卡彼欧的山朱里安村遭受大炮的猛击达一小时又二十分钟，蕊瓜伊西哈省的一个村庄民抗军击退宪兵的七十余次进攻。其他地区民抗军进行着灵活的游击战，屡予进犯者以伤亡。农民群众依靠山岳沼泽，协助民抗军游击。据悉：民抗军自菲岛解放以来，虽受美菲军的重重包剿与迫害，但力量仍有增长。此乃由于领导反对地主恢复压迫的斗争获得了广大人民的拥护。
