　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Reports from various sources: The 21-nation peace conference is scheduled to begin today in Paris. The day before the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated that he hoped the treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland could be signed immediately after the Paris Peace Conference, and that the U.S. position on the treaties was to support the results negotiated by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Byrnes also said: "The U.S. Government reserves the right to consider any supplementary or new proposals on their own merits." He also declared: "The U.S. Government reserves the right to change its position on matters where the Four Powers have not reached agreement." Byrnes summarized his views on the peace conference, saying: "The method of drafting treaties is not as I had hoped in London, but it is still far superior to the method after the last World War." British Foreign Secretary Bevin, suffering from a minor illness, has been advised by doctors to rest completely for at least a week, so the British delegation will be led by Prime Minister Attlee. The French government has announced the list of its delegation to the peace conference, headed by Bidault, with representatives including Deputy Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, Ambassador to the Soviet Union Catroux, Ambassador to Spain Massigli, Ambassador to the United States Bonnet, senior Foreign Ministry officials Lévi, Alphand, Seydoux, and thirteen technical advisors. Additionally, representatives of the foreign ministers of the four powers (Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union) met in the Luxembourg Palace on the 27th to discuss the issue of publishing the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and decided to publish the agreed-upon clauses on the 28th.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: The task of the 21-nation peace conference is to consider the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland proposed by the Council of Foreign Ministers and to make recommendations. The final formulation of the treaties is the responsibility of the four powers: the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. The issue of signing treaties with the five countries was first raised at the Soviet-American-British Potsdam Conference held last July, and the heads of state of the three countries instructed the Council of Foreign Ministers, established according to the Potsdam Conference, to resolve this issue as its "current important task."
　　Since then, the foreign ministers have held four meetings to discuss the issue. The first meeting was held in London from September 11th to October 2nd last year, convening 30 times and achieving considerable progress. Although the Soviet Union proposed signing agreements on the issues that had been agreed upon, it was not accepted by Britain and the United States, and the meeting adjourned without result. The second meeting was held in Moscow from December 16th to 26th last year, and an agreement was reached on the procedure for signing the five-nation treaties, but it did not involve specific issues. The third meeting was held in Paris from April 25th to May 16th this year. This meeting was the most contentious, and the differences of opinion among the governments on the draft treaties became more apparent. The fourth meeting was held in Paris from June 15th to July 12th this year. This meeting reached agreement on the important issues in the draft treaties of the five countries and determined the date of the 21-nation peace conference. The 21 countries participating in the peace conference are as follows: the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, China, Australia, Belgium, Byelorussia, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia, Greece, India, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, the Union of South Africa, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: Moscow News: The Soviet Cabinet Committee appointed the members of the Soviet delegation to the Paris Peace Conference on the 26th. The head of the delegation is Molotov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet Cabinet Committee, Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Gusev, Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Nikolai Novikov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic Rotovskis, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic Valéskalns, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic Rooks, and member of the Soviet Foreign Ministry Committee Perilnovikov.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Washington News: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes issued a statement on the 27th, outlining the U.S. plan for the Paris Peace Conference. Byrnes stated: The main task of the four foreign ministers in the peace conference will be to explain the various treaties that have been drafted to the other seventeen governments. Byrnes stated: After the peace conference submits suggestions on amendments and additions to the treaties, the four foreign ministers must meet to consider these suggestions and agree on the final content of the treaties. The rules of procedure of the conference stipulate that each government sends one representative, and Byrnes will serve as the U.S. representative. There are two subcommittees in the conference dedicated to studying the economic issues in the treaties. Byrnes will send Clayton and Thorp to attend the two subcommittees. Dunn will represent Nabes at the political subcommittee considering the treaty with Italy. Harriman, Smith, and Caffery will individually represent Byrnes at the subcommittees. Pauley will also assist in handling the compensation issues in the treaties. Byrnes stated that Senators Connally and Vandenberg will not attend the opening of the conference with him, but when the conference considers the final draft, they will be in Paris to provide Byrnes with advice. State Department Counselor Cohen will accompany Byrnes to Paris.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Associated Press, Paris: UN Secretary-General Lie has arrived here from Moscow. Lie said that Stalin and Molotov were very optimistic about protecting future peace. He continued, saying that he had talked with Stalin for an hour and had several meetings with Molotov, discussing issues related to the organization of the United Nations and political issues.

　　巴黎和会开始举行
    贝纳斯表示希望会后和约即能签字         
    联合国秘书长莱氏由莫斯科抵巴黎
    【新华社延安二十九日电】各方报导：二十一国和平会议，定今日起在巴黎开始举行，在开会的前一天，美国务卿贝纳斯表示，希望对意、罗、保、匈、芬的五国和约能在巴黎和会之后即行签字，美国对和约之立场，为支持外长会议所协商的结果。贝氏又谓：“美国政府保留对任何补充建议或新建议考虑其本身价值的权利。”同时宣称：“四强未获协议事项，美政府保有改变其立场的权利。”贝纳斯归纳其对于和会之观感称：“制订和约的方式虽不如我在伦敦所希望者，但犹远胜于上次大战后的方式。”英外相贝文因患微恙，医生嘱其至少须完全休息一周，因此英代表团由首相艾德礼率领出席。法政府已宣布其出席和会之代表团名单，团长为比道尔，代表为外交部次长薄尔特，驻苏大使贾德鲁，驻西大使马西格里，驻美大使庞纳，外交部高级官员梁维尔、艾尔蓬、赛都等，尚有十三名技术顾问。又息：英美法苏四国外长之代表，于二十七日在卢森堡宫开会，讨论公布对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案问题，决定于二十八日公布所已同意之条文。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】二十一国和会的任务，为考虑四外长会议所提对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国的和约草案，并提出建议。和约的最后制定，由苏、美、英、法四国负责。去年七月举行的苏、美、英波茨顿会议上，首次提出了对五国签定和约的问题，三国元首并授命根据波茨顿会议设立的外长会议，解决这一问题作为它的“当前重要任务”。
    此后各外长先后举行四次会议，进行讨论。第一次会议于去年九月十一日至十月二日在伦敦举行，集会三十次，曾达到相当成就，苏联虽提议在已同意的问题上签字，未被英美接受，这次会议遂无结果而散。第二次会议于去年十二月十六日至二十六日在莫斯科举行，曾就签订五国和约的程序问题达到协议，但未牵涉具体问题。第三次于今年四月二十五日至五月十六日在巴黎举行，这次会议争论最多，各国政府对和草中的意见分歧也更形明确。第四次会于今年六月十五日至七月十二日在巴黎举行，这次会议曾就五国和约草案中的各重要问题达到协议，并确定了二十一国和会的召开日期，参加和会的二十一国如下：苏联、英国、美国、法国、中国、澳大利亚、比利时、白俄罗斯、巴西、加拿大、捷克、阿比西尼亚、希腊、印度、新西兰、挪威、波兰、南菲联邦、南斯拉夫、乌克兰等。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联内阁委员会于二十六日任命苏联出席巴黎和平会议代表团成员，代表团团长苏联内阁委员会外委会委员长莫洛托夫，副外长维辛斯基，苏联驻英大使古赛夫，苏联驻法大使鲍哥莫洛夫，苏联驻美大使尼古拉·诺维科夫，立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长罗托夫斯基，拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长瓦莱斯卡鲁，爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长鲁克斯，苏维埃外交部委员会委员培里尔诺维科夫。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】华府讯：美国务卿贝纳斯于二十七日发表声明，概述美国对巴黎和会之计划。贝氏称：和平会议中四外长之主要任务，将为向其他十七国政府解释已经拟定之各种条约。贝氏称：和平会议提出关于各条约修正案及附加案之建议后，四国外长必须集合考虑此等建议，并协议各条约之最后内容。会议章程规定每一政府各派代表一人，贝氏将任美国之代表。会议中有两个小组会，专为研究条约中之经济问题，贝氏将派克莱敦及陶尔普出席该两小组会。邓恩将代表纳贝斯出席考虑对意条约政治小组会，哈立曼、史密斯、卡佛利将个别代表贝氏出席各小组会，鲍莱亦将在会中协助处理条约中之赔偿问题。贝氏称：参议员康纳利与范登堡在会议开幕时，将不随他出席，但当会议考虑最后草案时，彼等将在巴黎向贝氏提供意见。国务院参事柯恩将陪同贝氏联袂赴巴黎。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】美联社巴黎讯：联合国秘书长莱氏已自莫斯科抵此。莱氏称：斯大林与莫洛托夫对于保护未来之和平问题，甚为乐观。继称：曾与斯大林谈话一小时，并与莫洛托夫会谈数次，所谈者，系有关联合国之组织问题及政治问题。
