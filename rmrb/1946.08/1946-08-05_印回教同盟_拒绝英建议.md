　　Indian Muslim League
    Rejects British Proposal
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st - New Delhi dispatch: The Indian Muslim League has rescinded its acceptance of the British Cabinet Mission's White Paper of May 16th. League President Jinnah, in his opening speech to the League Committee on the 27th, condemned Britain for failing to fulfill its promises to the League. Jinnah said: The British Cabinet Mission went back on its word within ten days, making excessive concessions to the Congress Party. On the 28th, Jinnah, in continuing his speech, again condemned the Indian Viceroy Wavell for making the interim government plan a dead letter. Most speakers at the meeting supported Jinnah. Aral Sperby claimed that Britain's long-term proposal had fundamentally overturned the significance of Indian-Muslim partition. On the 29th, the committee passed a resolution rescinding its acceptance of the British Cabinet Mission's White Paper and the long-term and short-term plans for the formation of a government in India, and refusing to accept all official positions granted to Muslims.
