Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th (Delayed Dispatch) The 25th Group convened on the 17th to hear the report of a witness designated by the US side. All three parties questioned the report extensively. Several points have been affirmed by the US witness, Fritz (staff of the US Supply Office of the Executive Headquarters), namely: (1) About four or five miles from the scene of the incident, a unit of Chinese troops wearing khaki uniforms and holding the Blue Sky White Sun flag encountered US Marines. The unit headed east towards the scene of the incident. (2) The US Marines who went from Tianjin to Beiping on July 29 had only the small English letters "WSA" on their vehicles and no flags or other identification marks. Mr. Fritz also directly admitted that he was the commander of the conflict. He claimed that he was only notified to take command one and a half hours after the battle began. In the afternoon, Duke of the Beiping Military Police reported that on the 28th, he went from Beiping to Tianjin. After the car passed Anping for several miles, he saw a government army garrison and an officer who told Duke that Anping was garrisoned by the Eighth Route Army and hoped that the US military would send a team to Anping.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th (Delayed Dispatch) Although today is Sunday, the 25th Special Group still held a meeting for four hours. The meeting was chaired by the Kuomintang representative Zhang Shuheng. Starting at 9:00 AM, representatives from all three parties questioned Lieutenant Colonel Belcher, commander of the 1st Battalion, 11th Regiment, 1st Marine Division of the US Marine Corps. When answering a question from Major General Huang Yifeng, the CCP representative, Belcher clearly pointed out that when the US patrol team departed from Tianjin on July 29, it was expected that an accident might occur near Anping on that day, because the headquarters of the 1st Marine Division had learned that the convoy was ordered to go from Pingjin on July 26, and it had a conflict with the garrison in the area. Therefore, the organization of the patrol team was different from usual. Not only were some soldiers and weapons equipped, but also special communication equipment was available. Before the patrol team set off, Lieutenant Colonel Belcher also conveyed the order to deal with the incident, that is, if they encountered obstacles on the way, they should try their best to eliminate them. Secondly, the patrol team on that day was organized by the division headquarters, and its members included some combat personnel from the 1st Regiment and the 11th Regiment. More importantly, Belcher was even more certain that the ten-mile-wide area near Anping did not belong to the jurisdiction of the government army, because he had traveled back and forth between Pingjin many times and had never seen any trace of the government army in the area. Belcher believed that there were CCP troops there. Belcher also said that among the vehicles escorted by the patrol team on that day, there was a UNRRA car, and it was not clear what it was carrying, but it was known that there were four Chinese people in it. The CCP representative then asked whether Duke’s claim yesterday that this car was a customs car was true? Belcher replied that it was indeed a UNRRA vehicle, and said that Duke was a passenger in the car and did not know the truth about the patrol team, so his words were not credible.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th The liaison group of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, which departed for Xianghe on the 17th, has established contact with the CCP headquarters in the area and met with Commander Zeng Yongya. Commander Zeng expressed a warm welcome to the upcoming investigation by the 25th Special Group, and agreed to meet the investigation team at the address of Xianghe Middle School on the 21st, and stipulate the route of the liaison group entering the CCP area. Due to difficult roads, the liaison group arrived in Xianghe late in the evening of the 18th, and the group returned to Beiping at 3:00 pm on the 19th.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 20th (Delayed Dispatch) Today, the 25th Special Group decided to depart for Xianghe at 7:00 am on the 21st to listen to the testimony of witnesses from the CCP side. A special correspondent of this agency and two reporters from the Kuomintang and the US side will also accompany them. When the group met today, Major General Huang Yifeng, the CCP representative, presided over the meeting and first listened to the report and answered questions from Lieutenant Kennard of the US Military Police. The dispute caused in today's meeting was due to the fact that the translator of the Kuomintang side changed the content of his representative's speech without authorization. After the chairman pointed out the error, the translator admired it, and the Kuomintang representative tried hard to defend it, and threatened to refuse to continue questioning the witness. Chairman Huang Yifeng then explained that every translator must faithfully translate the accurate words of their representative, which is not only the chairman's wish, but also the hope of the Kuomintang representative. US Representative Colonel Madden also agreed with the chairman's explanation. After the three parties finished questioning Lieutenant Kennard, they discussed the letter from General Zeng Yongya to the group brought back from Xianghe by the liaison group. The letter said that the Chiang-puppet army has been constantly attacking Xianghe since August 3, and no less than hundreds of shells have fallen outside the city. In order to ensure the safety of the 25th Group's investigation in the area, the group must be requested to make effective prevention. To this end, the three parties agreed to hand over the original letter to the 25th Group for group processing, and the representatives of the KMT and the CCP in the meeting each notified the KMT and the CCP troops to immediately stop the conflict so that the investigation work of the 25th Special Group could proceed smoothly.

　　安平镇事件连日进行调查
    肇事者显为蒋美两方
    贝尔查证明安平原为中共军管辖
    美军巡逻队出发前曾作战斗准备
    【新华社北平十八日电】（迟到）第二十五小组于十七日集会听取美方所指定证人之报告，三方对该报告询问甚广，有数点已为美方证人傅瑞兹（执行部美方供给处人员）所肯定，即：（一）离肇事地点四五英里处，有穿卡机布之中国军队一部，持青天白日旗与美海军陆战队相遇，该部队向肇事地点东开。（二）七月二十九日由津赴平之美海军陆战队，除汽车上书有英文“ＷＳＡ”数小字外，并无任何旗帜或其他识别记号。傅氏并直认渠为冲突指挥者，渠称于战斗开始一时半后，始接获通知担任指挥。下午由北平美宪兵队丢克报告，据称：渠于二十八日由平赴津，当汽车越过安平数英里后，见有政府军队驻军一军官，曾语丢克称：安平系八路军驻守，希美军派队伍去安平云云。
    【新华社北平十八日电】（迟到）本日虽为星期日，二十五特别小组仍举行会议达四小时，由国方代表张叔衡任主席，上午九时起，三方代表对美海军陆战队第一师十一团第一营营长贝尔查中校提出询问，贝氏于回答中共代表黄逸峰少将之问题时，曾明白指出七月二十九日美方巡逻队自津出发时，已预计当日在安平附近可能发生事故，因陆战队第一师师部曾获悉七月二十六日训令运输队自平赴津途中曾在该地与驻军发生冲突之情报，故巡逻队之组织有异于平时，不仅增加若干兵员、武器配备，且备有特殊通讯设备。而在巡逻队出发前，贝尔查中校并曾传达应付事变之命令，即途中倘遇阻碍时，应尽力排除之。其次，当日之巡逻队系由师部编组，其成员包括第一团及十一团之若干战斗人员。更重要者，贝氏更确知安平附近十里宽之地段不属于政府军之管辖区，因彼往返平津多次，迄未见该地有政府军踪迹，贝氏相信该处有中共部队。贝氏又称：当日巡逻队所护送之车辆中，曾有行总汽车一辆，所载何物不明，但知其中乘坐华人四名。中共代表继询以昨日丢克曾称此车为海关车是否确实？贝氏答称确为行总车辆，并称丢克为一乘车之旅客，对巡逻队之实情不明，其言未足凭信云云。
    【新华社北平十九日电】十七日出发香河之北平执行部联络小组已与该地中共司令部取得联络，并曾会见曾雍雅司令。曾司令对二十五特别小组行将前往调查极表欢迎，并约定于二十一日在香河中学地址接见调查小组，及规定进入中共地区之联络小组之路线。因道路难行，联络小组十八日傍晚始达香河，该小组已于十九日午三时返抵北平。
    【新华社北平二十日电】（迟到）本日二十五特别小组决定于二十一日晨七时出发香河，以听取中共方面证人的证言。本社特派记者及国民党与美方两方记者各二人亦将随同前往。本日小组集会时，由中共代表黄逸峰少将任主席，首听取美军宪兵队坎拿特中尉报告和答复询问。今日会中引起的争论，是由于国民党方面译员的译其代表的发言时，擅自改变内容，经主席指出其错误后，该译员佩服，国方代表亦力加袒护，并以拒绝继续向证人发问相威胁。主席黄逸峰少将乃解释称：每一译员必须忠实译出自方代表的准确言词，这不仅是主席的愿望，也是国民党方面代表所希望的。美代表马丹上校亦同意主席的解说。三方于坎拿特中尉询问完毕后，即讨论联络小组从香河带回的曾雍雅将军给小组的信件，该信说：蒋伪军自八月三日以来，即不断进攻香河，该城郊外所落炮弹，不下数百发。为保障二十五小组在该地调查的安全，须请小组作有效的制止。对此三方同意将原信交二十五小组分组处理，而由会中的国共双方代表各自通知国共双方军队，立即停止冲突，使二十五特别小组的调查工作得以顺利进行。
