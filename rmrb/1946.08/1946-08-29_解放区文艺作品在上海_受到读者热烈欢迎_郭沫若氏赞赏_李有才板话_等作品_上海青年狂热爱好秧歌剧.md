Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 26th: Shanghai dispatch: Literary works from the liberated areas are receiving an enthusiastic welcome from readers here. After reading "The Ballad of Li Youcai" (by Zhao Shuli) and "Selected Works," Guo Moruo, an authority in cultural circles, published a commentary in the Wenhui Daily on August 16th. Regarding "The Ballad of Li Youcai," he wrote: "I am completely intoxicated by its fresh, healthy, and simple content and techniques; here there is a new world, new characters, new meanings, new style, new culture, whoever reads it, I believe, will feel interested." Regarding the twelve short stories in "Selected Works," Guo said: "I like Kang Tuo's 'My Two Landlords' the most, its technique has reached perfection; Sheng Shaozinan's 'Landmine Warfare' is a ballad-style eulogy; 'The Story of a Woman's Emancipation' writes very vividly about a female hero, Zhe Juying, it is more flavorful than reading a long novel." Guo concluded: "In short: I have recently read these two unexpectedly satisfying good books, and I am willing to recommend these two good books as outstanding literary works since the War of Resistance; I hope that these two books can be reprinted in Shanghai (note: three editions of six thousand copies have already been sold) so that they can be closer to the sun-facing readers." In addition, Ai Qing's long poem "Wu Manyou" is also very popular. The Yangko opera popular in the liberated areas is enthusiastically loved by Shanghai youth. Many schools and student groups have added Yangko programs to their evening parties. Famous playwright Liu Xiwei (Li Jianwu) called the reformers of Yangko in a short article "unsung heroes," and said: "The Yangko opera depicting peasants shows the infinite hope of literary life."

    【新华社南京二十六日电】沪讯：解放区的文艺作品，在此间受到读者热烈欢迎。文化界权威郭沫若氏在读完“李有才板话”（赵树理书）和“创作选辑”之后，在八月十六日文汇报上发表评论，关于“李有才板话”写道：“我完全陶醉了被那新鲜、健康、简朴的内容与手法；这儿有新的天地，新的人物，新的意义，新的作风，新的文化，谁读了我相信都会感着兴趣的。”关于“创作选辑”中十二个短篇小说，郭氏称：“我最喜欢的是康濯的《我的两个房东》，它的技巧是达到了完善的地步；生邵子南的《地雷阵》是板话式的歌颂；《一个女人翻身的故事》把一位女英雄折聚英的一写得很灵活，比读了一部长篇还要有味。”郭氏结语称：“总之：我最近读了这两本意外令人满意的好书，我愿意把这两本好书推荐为抗战以来文艺作品的杰出者，这两本书我希望能在上海重版（按：已销了三版六千册）。使它们更能够与向阳的读者接近。”此外艾青的长诗《吴满有》，也很受欢迎，解放区流行的秧歌剧则为上海青年们所狂热爱好，许多学校里学生团体的晚会新添了秧歌的节目，名剧作家刘西渭（李健吾）在一篇短文中把秧歌的改良者们称为“无名英雄”，并且说：“在描写农民的秧歌剧中表现着文学生命的无穷希望”。
