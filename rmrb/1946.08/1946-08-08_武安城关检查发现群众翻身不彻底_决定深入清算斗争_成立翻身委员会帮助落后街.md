(Changzhi News) The Chengguan District of Wuan is actively preparing to comprehensively and deeply launch the anti-traitor revenge and rent reduction liquidation struggle. On July 28th and 29th, the district leaders went deep into the area to conduct inspections. Although the 24 streets of Chengguan have undergone many vigorous joint struggles, the development of the movement is still very unbalanced and incomplete. The following serious problems still exist: First, in the streets with poor or newly initiated movements, all kinds of complex and unclear bad elements take the opportunity to infiltrate the leading groups of each street. Among the government cadres of the Eighth Street, the deputy street chief, the anti-conscription committee member, and the secretary are all landlords owning more than 80 to 150 mu of land. The father of the chairman of the People's Federation served as a secretary for the great traitor Li Maozhai. The landlord secretly retorted to him: "You, the leader, are fighting me, who will fight your father?" Therefore, he never dared to raise his head. The street held meetings with guards, blocking the work personnel. Anyone who leaked information would face confession, punishment, and beatings. The Sixteenth Street, which was pseudo-ized and poisoned in the past, was the old nest of great traitors and drug dealers such as Han Leran, Bai Huan, Dong Laowu, and Qi Zhanmei. The cadres of this street shielded landlords by pretending to be enlightened and engaging in false struggles. Other streets, such as the Fifteenth, Eleventh, Fourth, and Fifth Streets, also belong to this type. The masses do not believe that they can lead the turning over, saying that they are "welcoming to anyone." Secondly, in the better mobilized streets, such as the Thirteenth and First Streets, although a group of reliable cadres and activists have emerged, and some mass organizations have been improved, and the masses have gained considerable benefits, they are also very incomplete. For example, in the First Street, out of 150 households, 18 households have obtained fruits, and 15 households have not turned over. The landlords in the 24 streets generally still control a large number of houses and retain a large amount of land, and have not yet been liquidated. After such an inspection, it was decided that the mass movement in Chengguan still needs to be further deepened and comprehensively and vigorously launched. The leadership concentrated its efforts and focused on backward streets to help backward people. First, break through the blockade circle of bad cadres, resolutely eliminate special agents and landlords from the leading groups, and mobilize a wider range of the masses from the continued telling of grievances to discover problems. By solving individual problems, we will then organize large-scale joint struggles to completely defeat feudal rule. Transform hooligans, smokers, prostitutes, and lower-level personnel and families of puppet troops and puppet organizations, and carry out the "hat removal movement," proposing: "The poor are one family, and they should be treated the same after removing their hats," so that 80% of the masses can obtain fruits and achieve the elimination of extreme poverty.

On the 30th and 31st, a meeting of active cadres and activists in the entire Chengguan turning-over process was held to conduct specific inspections and discussions. It was unanimously agreed that in order to thoroughly turn over, it is necessary to achieve "having the capital to do business, and daring to make decisions when speaking as masters." Now, all streets have launched mass turning-over inspections, and turning-over committees have been established in the four cardinal points of east, west, north, and south. People with real turning-over experience and supported by the masses are elected as members to uniformly mobilize forces and solve disputes between streets. Turning-over assault groups will also be formed to help backward streets launch a vigorous turning-over movement. (Yi Fan)

　　武安城关检查发现群众翻身不彻底
    决定深入清算斗争
    成立翻身委员会帮助落后街
    【长治讯】武安城关区正积极准备全面深入的开展反奸复仇，减租清算斗争。七月二十八、二十九两日该区领导上曾深入进行检查。全城关二十四街，虽经过多次轰轰烈烈的联合斗争，但运动发展还十分不平衡与不彻底，目前还存在如下严重问题：首先是发动差的或刚发动的街，各种复杂的面目不清的坏分子乘机钻进各街的领导集团中来。八街政权干部中，副街长、抗勤委员、书记，都是拥有八十亩以上到一百五十亩地的地主，平联会主席的父亲给大汉奸李茂斋当过书记，地主暗中反问他：“你领导人斗俺，谁斗你父亲哩？”因此他始终不敢抬起头来，该街开会站着岗，封锁工作员，谁要透了风，一坦白、二处分、三吊打。过去伪化、毒化了的十六街，是大汉奸、毒犯韩乐然、白寰、董老五、齐占梅等的老巢，该街干部在斗争中包庇地主假开明、假斗争等，其他如十五、十一、四、五等街，都属这种类型，群众不相信他们会领导翻身，说他们是“谁来也吃得开”。其次发动较好的如十三街、一街等，虽然涌现了一批可靠的干部和积极分子，部分群团已健全起来，群众已获得不少利益，但也十分不彻底。如一街百五十户，得到果实的十八户，还有十五户没翻身。廿四街地主几普遍还掌握大批房子，保有大量土地，还未进行清算。经过这样检查，决定城关群运还需要进一步深入与全面猛烈地展开。领导上集中力量，有重点地放在落后街，帮助落后人，首先突破坏干部的封锁圈，坚决把特务和地主从领导集团中清除出去，从继续诉苦中，发动更广泛的群众，发现问题。由解决个别问题，进而组织大的联合斗争，彻底打垮封建统治。改造二流子、烟民、妓女及伪军伪组织下层人员及家属，开展“摘帽运动”，提出：“穷人是一家，摘下帽子一样看待他”，使百分之八十群众得到果实，达到消灭赤贫。
    三十、三十一两日召开全城关翻身的积极干部及积极分子会议进行具体检查与讨论，一致认为要彻底翻身，必须达到“有本钱做生意，当家说话敢作主。”现各街都纷纷举行群众性的翻身检查，分东西南北四个基点成立翻身委员会，选举真正富有翻身经验，为群众所拥护的人当委员，统一调动力量，解决各街间纠纷问题，并将分组翻身突击组，帮助落后街开展猛烈的翻身运动。（一帆）
