【Benbao Weixian News】On the 16th of last month, more than two thousand citizens of Linqing City gathered, struggling against the great despotic landlord Ji Xiaofan with angry emotions. Ji has always colluded with the government to oppress the common people. After the incident, he intensified his actions, relying on the pseudo-county chief Zhao Wentao and the pseudo-captain Luan Ziyu to rape women, seize people's wealth, and kill a total of fifteen people, extorting and seizing countless farmers' land and property. At the meeting, the victims competed to accuse him of his inhuman crimes. Han Yushi cried and said: "My daughter was forced to sell to Ji Xiaofan as a maid when she was eleven years old. She was raped by him when she was fifteen. At seventeen, she was pregnant and driven out. Her father went to the yamen to sue, but he was falsely accused of selling white flour and shot dead by the yamen. My daughter was so ashamed and angry that she hanged herself!" She gritted her teeth and shouted: "Now I want to avenge my daughter and my old man!" Ji bought a seventeen-year-old maid from Ni Zhuang. She was raped as soon as she entered the door. After Ji raped her, he watched his wife beat her violently and used a burning opium stick to pierce her to death from her vagina. A total of five people were raped to death by the tyrant Ji Xiaofan in this way, all of them girls aged eleven to seventeen. When a fellow villager ×× accused Ji of残害(cánhài: brutally killing or harming) all five members of the family of his clansman Liu Dianchen, he burst into tears and fainted. He indignantly stated that Ji Xiaofan seized Liu's wife and then seized his three daughters, and finally seized all of his family's forty-odd acres of good land. Liu saw that his wife, daughters, and property had been robbed, and he was so angry that he could not seek justice anywhere, and he died of anger. Liu's wife also died of shame and hatred because she herself had been defiled and all three of her daughters had been raped. The masses shouted angrily: "Down with this inhuman beast!" and raised their fists to pull Ji Xiaofan down and beat him to death to vent their anger. Finally, they unanimously decided to hand him over to the government for punishment according to the law.
