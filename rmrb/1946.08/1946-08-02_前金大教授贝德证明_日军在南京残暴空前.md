Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. Tokyo dispatch: Former Jinling University history professor, Mr. Bates, detailed to the International War Crimes Tribunal on the 28th the various atrocities committed by the Japanese army in Nanjing, including rape, massacre, arson, and plunder. Bates stated: The Japanese army raped women day and night, sometimes even doing so in the streets. One woman was gang-raped by seventeen Japanese soldiers in a cemetery. A girl of only nine years old and her seventy-six-year-old grandmother were both raped in Nanjing city. The Japanese army, in teams of fifteen to twenty, often entered civilian areas day and night to search for women, and even the wives of university professors were not spared from being violated. When Bates returned to Nanjing, he witnessed the most cunning and vicious schemes for slaughtering the people. At that time, Matsui, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, issued a proclamation saying that Japan treated the Chinese with goodwill, stating in the proclamation that if Chinese soldiers joined labor teams, everything could be forgiven; however, when some Chinese soldiers admitted their past identities, they were immediately lined up and machine-gunned by the Japanese soldiers. In addition, two hundred Chinese civilians were shot and killed by Japanese soldiers the night after they left Jinling University. Bates described the Japanese looting as organized and consistent behavior. He also stated that the Japanese army burned and plundered the property of Americans who respected neutrality. Bates also mentioned the Japanese army's arson atrocities, saying that the burning in Nanjing after its fall continued for as long as six weeks.

    日军在南京残暴空前
    【新华社延安三十日电】东京讯：前金大史学教授贝德氏，二十八日在国际战犯法庭详述日军在南京所犯各种奸淫屠杀及焚掠等暴行。贝氏称：日军奸淫妇女，不分昼夜，有时竟在街上为之，有一妇女在某墓地内，遭日兵十七人轮奸。有一年仅九岁的女孩及她的七十六岁的祖母，竟在南京城内同被奸淫。日军每以十五至二十人为一队，常不分日夜进入平民区搜罗妇女，甚至大学教授的夫人亦不免遭受蹂躏。贝氏回南京时，见到最奸诈毒辣屠杀人民的诡计，当时日军总司令松井曾出一布告，谓日本以善意待中国人，布告中谓中国兵如参加劳动队，则一切可以不计；但俟若干中国兵承认其过去之身份时，即被日兵排行用机关枪扫射。另有中国平民二百人，于离开金陵大学校以后，当晚即被日兵射杀。贝氏叙述日本之劫掠为有组织及一贯之行为。又称：日军焚毁并劫掠尊重中立的美人财产。贝氏并述及日军之焚毁暴行，据谓：南京沦陷后长时间的焚烧，继续达六星期之久。
