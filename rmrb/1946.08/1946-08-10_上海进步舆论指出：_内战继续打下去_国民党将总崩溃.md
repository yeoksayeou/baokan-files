Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Shanghai Dispatch: If the civil war continues, it will cause the overall collapse of the Kuomintang. This is the general opinion of progressive public opinion circles here. Mr. Pi Qiang said: "Many people, even some of the Kuomintang reactionaries, can see that the Kuomintang will collapse in the civil war, but the Communist Party will not, because the Kuomintang today is an almost completely rotten, top-down empty shell." Mr. Li Keming said: "The Kuomintang itself already has too many problems. Is it possible to face such a profound crisis with such an unbearable institution and fight for a long time?" Mr. Li Nanshan said: "The troops are so bad, the famine is so serious, the economy is so panicked, and the people are so tired of war. Even if the warmongers are keen on war, if the other side is not weak and the people's hearts are with them, how can this civil war be fought?" Ai Hansong said: "As a result of the war, the people will be poor and their wealth exhausted, the people will have no means of livelihood, the people's grievances will boil, and the people's uprisings will arise. At that time, the whole country may be in chaos. Although the party suppressing the chaos has 'American equipment,' what can it do if its soldiers are unwilling to fight and the people are tired of war?" The Democratic National Construction Association specifically pointed out that for the sake of the civil war, monthly military spending of more than 200 billion yuan cannot be reduced, but can only increase, and inflation will naturally fall into an uncontrollable situation. On the other hand, in addition to destroying a large amount of materials, military operations also shrink industrial and agricultural production and disrupt transportation. Under the double attack of daily inflation and daily elimination of materials, how can the economy not collapse? The collapse of the economy may also be the collapse of the entire political and military system at the same time. Moreover, the disaster has spread across the country, tens of millions of famine victims are waiting to be fed, and the tide of strikes and work slowdowns has spread to public school teachers. The situation can be said to be extremely serious. Can we still fight? Can we still delay because of the war? Therefore, the association believes that war is equal to delay, and delay is still a dead end. There is only one way out, which is to stop the war.

### 上海进步舆论指出：  内战继续打下去  国民党将总崩溃

　　上海进步舆论指出：
    内战继续打下去
    国民党将总崩溃
    【新华社延安七日电】沪汛：内战打下去，将引起国民党的总崩溃，这是此间进步舆论界的一般意见。丕强氏称：“许多人就连国民党反动派中的一部分，都看得出国民党在内战中会自趋崩溃，共产党则不会，因为国民党今天是一个几乎将要完全腐烂的、自上而下的空架子。”李克明氏说：“国民党本身问题已经多得不能再多，以如此不堪的机构面临如此深刻的危机，长期打下去，将是可能的吗？”李南山氏说：“部队如此不行，饥荒这样严重，经济这样恐慌，民心这样厌战，好战分子纵使好战，如果对方并不弱，而且民心归之，这个内战如何打法？”艾寒松氏称：“战争结果，民穷财尽，民不聊生，民怨沸腾，民变蜂起，到那时候就可能弄得全国大乱。制乱的一方虽然拥有‘美式配备’，其奈士不用命，人民厌战何？”民主建国会更具体指出：为着内战，每月二千亿元以上的军费不但无法减少，而且只有增加，通货膨胀自然就更要陷于无法收拾的地步。另一面，军事行动除了大量毁灭物资以外，还使工农生产萎缩，交通停顿，在通货逐日膨胀和物资逐日消灭的面面夹攻之下，经济那得不崩溃？！经济的崩溃，可能同时就是整个政治军事的崩溃。且看灾荒已经遍满全国，数千万的饥民嗷嗷待哺，罢工怠工的风潮已经蔓延到公教人员，形势也可说是严重到极点了，还能战吗？还能因战而拖吗？因此该会认为战就等于拖，拖依然是死路，活路只有一条，就是停战。
