    The news of Mr. Xingzhi's death from illness has come as a great shock! Mr. Xingzhi was the standard-bearer of education for the Chinese people and a giant star of the democratic movement. At a time when the nation is facing multiple difficulties and the people are suffering, just when we were relying on Mr. to lead the struggle, he suddenly passed away. This is a major loss for our nation and people. While mourning, we are determined to inherit and continue the unfinished cause of his life. We hope you will restrain your grief, uphold his aspirations, and work together. We hereby send our condolences.

    To Shanghai Teacher Tao, and Messrs. Tao Hong and Xiaoguang:
    We are deeply saddened beyond words to hear of Teacher Xingzhi's death! For thirty years, our teacher fought arduously and unyieldingly for the education of the Chinese people and the national democratic movement. Now that he has suddenly passed away, the people's guide, we have suddenly lost a good teacher. Zong Lin and others vow to follow our teacher's will and continue the struggle to comfort his spirit. We earnestly hope that the teacher and all the brothers will restrain your grief and take care of yourselves. We send this telegram of condolences.
    Zong Zhanglin, Ning Yue, Ding Hua, Xu Mingqing, Cao Jianpei, Xu Ganru, Chen Fujun, Fu Zhaoling, Liu Cunjjiu.
