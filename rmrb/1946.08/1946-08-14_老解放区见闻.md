　　What I Saw in the Old Liberated Areas
    Zhang Lizhi
    This is an excerpt from a letter written by Mr. Zhang Lizhi, the vice principal of Taihang No. 8 Middle School (in Jiaozuo City), to his fellow villager Mr. Feng. Mr. Zhang went to the administrative office in mid-July to attend a meeting of secondary school principals. It was his first time in the heartland of the liberated area, and he was deeply touched by what he saw and heard along the way. In his letter to Mr. Feng, Mr. Zhang said: "The scenery along the way is very different from our place, it's really enviable." The following are excerpts from the letter:
    Nothing Lost: We were traveling by car to the river滩 north of Gaoping when we lost a large leather bag, only realizing it after traveling seven or eight 里. A comrade was extremely anxious because his official documents and important items were stored inside, so he returned to the original location to search for it. We had not traveled two 里 further when a person came running from a small path south of the road, shouting loudly, "Comrade, you dropped your bag!" We looked and were overjoyed. We never expected the original item to be returned, it was truly an unprecedented sight.
    Well-Organized Guest Houses: We generally stay in inns when traveling, but sometimes we can't reach an inn due to rain. In that case, the village guest houses provide food and lodging, and the hospitality is extremely attentive, so military and government travelers do not feel the hardships of travel. This is also an unprecedented fact.
    Doors Unlocked at Night: It was cloudy and heavily raining, and the Zhang River was overflowing. Travelers were gathered and staying in Zhao Shatun Village (north bank of the Zhang River). We also stayed in the village. Late at night, we could still hear constant laughter and talking on the main street. Upon asking, we learned that they don't lock their doors at night, living in peacetime, so that is why.
    Fruit and Vegetables Everywhere: The fruit trees on both sides of the road are laden with fruit, hanging no more than two or three 尺 from the ground. Melons and vegetables are all over the ground and are very conspicuous, but passersby never steal them. Other peaches and apricots are ripe, colorful to look at, and fragrant to smell. Old and young people pass by, acting as if they don't see them. Are the people here all of the Xu Heng type? How honest they are!
    Children's Teams Take Things Seriously: Large and small villages all have children or women standing guard, checking pedestrians, and taking things very seriously. Even high-ranking military and government officials riding horses or in cars are not spared. In the past, children and women were useless people, but now they are organized and responsible for self-defense. The scale of this force is unheard of.

### 老解放区见闻

　　老解放区见闻
    张励之
    这是太行八中（在焦作市）副校长张励之先生给他乡亲冯某信中之一段。张先生七月中旬由焦作到行署参加中等学校校长会议，系第一次到解放区腹地，沿路所见所闻，感触殊深。张先生在与他乡亲冯某信中说：“来时路上风光，与咱处大不相同，真是令人羡慕。”兹将该信摘记于后：
    路不失遗：我们坐车到高平以北之河滩，将大皮包失掉，走七八里始为发觉。有一同志，异常着急，因他的公文及重要物品，均在内保存，故仍返原地找寻。我们前行不到二里，乃有一人从汽路南之小道，飞跑奔来，大声高呼“同志，把皮包掉了”。我们接着一看，喜出望外，想不到原物送来，真是空前未有之奇见。
    招待所组织完备：我们行路以住店为原则，然有时因雨赶不到店时，而村中之招待所，备吃备住，招待极其周到，使军政行人，不感旅行之苦，亦为空前未有之事实。
    夜不闭户：天阴大雨，漳河暴涨，旅客均集住赵苫村（漳河北沿）。我们亦在该村留宿，夜深仍闻大街上说笑声不断。问之，乃知夜不闭户，过升平时光，故如此也。
    瓜果满目：汽路两旁之果木，果实满挂，距地不过二三尺，瓜菜满地，非常醒目，而行人从未偷盗。其他桃杏已熟，望之有色，嗅之有香，老少经过，置若罔见。抑此地之人皆许衡之流耶，何诚实若是？
    儿童队认真：大小村庄，均有儿童，或妇女站岗，检查行人，异常认真，虽军政要职，骑马坐车者，亦不能幸免。过去儿童妇女，乃无用之人，今则组织起来，负责自卫，力量之大，闻所未闻。
