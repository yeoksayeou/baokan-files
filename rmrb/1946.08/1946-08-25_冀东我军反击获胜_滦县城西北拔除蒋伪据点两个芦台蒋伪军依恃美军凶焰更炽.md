Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 22nd -- (1) On the night of August 15th, the Eighth Route Army on the Xianghe front launched a counterattack with a portion of its forces against the 168th Regiment of the 56th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army and the 425th and 426th Regiments of the 142nd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which had invaded Yinjiahe (southeast of Xiji) and Yongmiao. The Chiang Kai-shek troops were terrified and blindly fired with machine guns all night. The assault teams organized by the Eighth Route Army soldiers took the opportunity to attack, seizing one light machine gun, one 60mm mortar, three submachine guns, and thirty-six rifles. (2) Anggezhuang and Xiaoying, important strongholds of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops invading the Liberated Area, more than twenty li northwest of Luan County, were successively removed by the Eighth Route Army on the 25th of this month. Most of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops stationed there were annihilated, with more than forty killed and captured, and one light machine gun and forty rifles seized. Since the American military cooperated with puppet troops to invade and shell Xiaochenzhuang (east of Lutai) in the Liberated Area from Lutai station on the 27th of last month, our army has endured the pain and retreated in order to avoid escalating the situation. The Chiang Kai-shek army's 363rd Regiment of the 121st Division and Guo Zhensheng's puppet troops in Lutai, relying on the ferocity of the American military, have become even more rampant. Since this month, their invasions and harassments of the Liberated Area have become more frequent. On the 2nd, they invaded Gao@zhuang and Nanhuzhuang northwest of Lutai. On the 4th, they invaded Daxiaofangzhuang northeast of Lutai. On the 9th, they invaded Caozhuang near Lutai. On the 10th, they invaded Renzhuangzi northeast of Lutai. On the 14th, they dispatched more than 400 people to encircle Nanjian’gu, the residence of the Fifth District Office of the Ninghe Democratic Government, brutally killing three district cadres, including Lan Xiang, and abducting four workers. The district head, Li Jian, also heroically sacrificed himself during the breakthrough.
