[This article transmitted from] Yangcheng, August 5th: The Taiyue Military Region summarized the situation of the self-defense war in the region since July, stating that the Southern Shanxi Self-Defense War has achieved preliminary victory. After Dong Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the 38th Group Army of the Kuomintang, and Luo Lie, Commander of the First Army, went to Nanjing for a meeting in late June, they mobilized a total of seven divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's troops. At the beginning of July, they fiercely attacked our Southern Shanxi Liberated Area. By the 11th, the Chiang Kai-shek troops successively occupied Maojin Ferry, Zhangdian, and the entire Yuncheng-Maojin Highway, and continued northward along the Anyi-Yuncheng-Datong Railway, successively occupying towns such as Shuitou, Yanzhang, Huzhang, Guodian, and Wenxi, as well as more than 460 large and small villages. In the occupied areas, Chiang Kai-shek's troops universally forced "maintenance" and carried out rape, massacre, and terror. The vast military and civilians in Southern Shanxi were forced to rise up in self-defense. It is reported that hundreds of thousands of militiamen in Xia County bravely cooperated with the Eighth Route Army in continuously annihilating most of the 31st Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, as well as parts of the 167th Division and the 78th Division, totaling more than 3,500 people, in the several days of the 13th and 16th, capturing 38 various cannons, more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 1,000 rifles. The vast occupied areas east of the Wenxi-Shuitou line were completely restored. On the 28th, after Zhangdian and Maojin were recovered, the entire Zhangdian-Maojin Highway was also liberated. The Chiang Kai-shek troops' attempt to open the Datong Railway between Yuncheng and Linfen has not yet been realized. South of Taiyuan, Yan Xishan's troops on the northern Datong line, in order to echo the Chiang Kai-shek troops' attack on Southern Shanxi, also concentrated superior forces and carried out key advances towards Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, and Huoxian, launching a total of 57 attacks on us, invading more than a dozen important villages and towns such as Dongquan, Jingdao, Baohe, and Jinbi. The local Eighth Route Army resolutely counterattacked, and all the occupied villages and towns were immediately restored. On the 19th, more than 900 Yan Xishan troops who invaded Shangguan, south of Quwo, were largely annihilated by us. The puppet troops of Duan Bingchang in Qin County, in the Baijin area, echoing the attack of Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's troops, were disarmed on the 21st under the siege of local military and civilians, and Qin County and Wuxiang were completely liberated. At this point, the Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and puppet troops who invaded this area have all been compressed into a narrow area along the Zhengtai and Datong lines. However, the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan troops, whose ambitions have not died, are now preparing for a second offensive. According to reports, the area south of Linfen (some say south of Hanxinling in Lingshi) has been assigned to the Chiang Kai-shek troops for takeover, while the area north and the Zhengtai line have been assigned to the Yan Xishan troops, in order to concentrate forces and launch a coordinated offensive from the north and south. It is now reported that four divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops (47th, 78th, 167th, and New 1st) have been assembled between Wenxi and Shuitou. The 53rd Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, originally stationed in Meng County, has also been increased to Anyi, preparing to move out at any time. On the southern section of the Datong Railway, most of the 39th Division and 66th Division of Yan Xishan's troops stationed in Linfen have been transferred to Hongdong and Zhaocheng, and the headquarters of the 61st Army has moved to Huoxian. The 69th Division was transferred to Huoxian on the 29th, and the 72nd Division originally stationed in Xinjiang is also continuing to move north. Fierce battles are currently taking place in the Lingshi and Huoxian areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, August 8th: Huairen and Kouquan in northern Shanxi were liberated on the 2nd. According to incomplete statistics, the battle results are as follows: Huairen: More than 1,000 puppet troops of Zhang Zuohuang's unit were annihilated and captured, and one cannon, six heavy machine guns, sixteen light machine guns, more than 300 long and short guns, a large cart of mortar shells, more than 30 mules and horses, and one radio station were captured. Kouquan: When defeating more than 800 Yan Xishan puppet troops of Wang Linhou who came from Datong to reinforce, two trains and two cars were captured. There are now no traces of Yan Xishan puppet troops west of Xiguan in Datong.

　　【本报阳城五日电】太岳军区总结该区七月以来自卫战争情形称：晋南自卫战我军已获初步胜利，六月下旬国民党三十八集团军总司令董剑、第一军军长罗列至南京开会后，即调动蒋阎军共七师兵力，于七月初，猛犯我晋南解放区，至十一日，蒋军先后占我矛津渡张店及运（城）茅（津）公路全线，并沿安邑运城同蒲路北上，继续占我水头、堰掌、胡张、郭店、闻喜等城镇，及大小村庄四百六十余处。在侵占区蒋军普遍强迫“维持”，并实行奸淫屠杀恐怖，晋南广大军民被迫奋起自卫。闻知夏县十余万民兵群众，于十三、十六数日中英勇配合八路军连续歼灭蒋军三十一师大部，一六七师、七十八师各一部，共三千五百余人，缴获各种炮三十八门，轻重机枪百余挺，步枪一千余支，闻喜水头线以东广大被侵占地区，即全部恢复。二十八日，张（店）茅（津）收复后，张（店）茅（津）公路全线亦同获解放。蒋军打通运城、临汾间同蒲路的企图，迄未实现。太原以南，同蒲北线阎军，为呼应晋南蒋军进攻，亦同时集中优势兵力，向我平遥、介休、灵石、霍县等地实行重点突进，先后向我进攻达五十七次，侵我东泉、静岛、保和、靳壁等重要村镇数十余处，当地八路军坚决反击，被占村镇当即全部恢复。十九日，侵占曲沃南上官之阎军九百余人，更大部为我歼灭。白晋方面与蒋阎军进攻相呼应之沁县伪军段炳昌部，在当地军民围困下，亦于二十一日解除武装，沁县、武乡全获解放。至此侵犯本区之蒋阎伪军，已全被压缩于正太、同蒲沿线狭小地带内。但野心未死的蒋阎军，现又准备第二次进攻，据息：临汾以南（一说为灵石韩信岭以南）已划归蒋军接防，以北及正太线则划归阎军，以便集中兵力，南北呼应进攻。现闻喜水头间，蒋军已集结四师兵力（四七、七八、一六七、新一），原驻孟县之蒋军五十三师，亦增至安邑，准备随时出动。同蒲南段，阎军驻临汾之三九师、六十六师大部调至洪洞赵城六十一军军部转移驻霍县，六十九师于二十九日调集霍县，原驻新绛之七十二师亦正继续北调，现激战正在灵石、霍县一带进行中。
    【新华社张家口八日电】晋北怀仁、口泉于二日解放，据不完全统计，所获战果如下：怀仁方面：歼俘伪张佐煌部千余人，缴获大炮一门，重机枪六挺，轻机枪十六挺，长短枪三百余支，迫击炮弹一大车，骡马三十余匹，电台一座。口泉方面：于击溃自大同出援王林厚之阎伪军八百余人时，缴获火车两列，汽车两辆，现大同西关以西已无阎伪军踪迹。
