Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. Seoul dispatch: The General League of Korean Cultural Organizations, established here in March of this year, has recently grown into a broadly influential organization with 18,000 members. According to Huo Yali (transliteration), vice chairman of the League and member of the Central Committee of the Korean Cultural Association, reactionary elements and pro-Japanese elements in the American-occupied southern Korea are granted all kinds of privileges and freedoms, while democratic elements are subjected to violent repression. However, even the people of southern Korea are closely united under the banner of the National Democratic Front. The Korean Writers Association, the Korean Scientific and Technical Workers Association, and twenty-four other cultural associations uniting Korean literature, film, drama, fine arts, music, dance, natural sciences, sports, education, and journalism workers, established the General League of Korean Cultural Organizations in March. This league unites all prominent figures in the scientific and artistic fields. At a meeting held in Japan, a demand was made for the restoration of the Soviet-American Joint Commission in Seoul. At the same time, more than 500 professors and other experts in the scientific and artistic fields have established the Korean-Soviet Cultural Association.
