Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to the Shanghai Wen Hui Bao on the 2nd, Li Jinsheng of Aiteng Village, Hanlu Township, Anyang County, harvested 70 *shi* of wheat this year but was assessed 90 *shi*. After paying the full amount, his family had no food left, and he died crying. Zhang Jinran of the same village handed over six *dou* of wheat, but had only harvested three; paying it all left him only half of what he needed. He hanged himself. Ji Shengqing Zhang Muqiao, a member of the fourth household of the fifth *jia*, handed over all the wheat she harvested but it wasn't enough, so she threw herself into a well and died. The *baozhang*, Chang Shun, also committed suicide by jumping into a well because he was forced to collect grain. This "grain requisition" was only the "regimental grain" of Wang Zizai's puppet army, which had been reorganized by the Kuomintang; it was not even the formal "grain levy" or "grain borrowing" of the Kuomintang government.

Of the 120 counties in Henan, over 90 have been affected by yellow locusts, wind, hail, drought, locust plagues, and harassment by stationed troops. The province's wheat harvest this year is less than 30% of normal, but there are 780,000 stationed troops (not including reorganized puppet troops and local militias). The Kuomintang government only provides food for 380,000 people, leaving the rest to "fend for themselves." As a result, the entire province is subsidizing military rations and "non-staple food expenses" amounting to 760,000,000 yuan per month. According to official statistics, 7,800,000,000 yuan has been paid in subsidies in the ten months since "liberation." This does not include local extortion and assessments. As for the Yellow River works and dike-building projects, there were original budget estimates, but the commissioners are even assessing the local population for willow branches, materials, and wooden stakes. It is estimated that the "purchasing" of materials and wooden stakes in the first and fourth districts alone is worth 500,000,000 yuan; the first, second, fourth, fifth, tenth, and twelfth districts each sent 20,000 laborers, with a monthly "advance" of 180,000,000 yuan for labor costs. After four months of construction, this amounts to over 7,000,000,000 yuan. The above military rations and Yellow River works have already squeezed over 15,000,000,000 yuan from the people. On July 13, the people of various counties organized "disaster appeal groups" and went to the provincial capital to petition, demanding a reduction in this year's "actual levy" and "borrowing levy." The representatives said, "The amount is so huge that it wouldn't be enough even if the people gave all their grain to the government." However, the Kuomintang authorities ignored the appeals of the petition groups.

### 沪文汇报报导：蒋军横征成大灾  河南人民上吊投井

　　沪文汇报报导：
    蒋军横征成大灾
    河南人民上吊投井
    【新华社延安十九日电】据二日沪文汇报载称：安阳县韩陆乡艾停村李金声本年收麦七十石，应摊派九十石，全数缴纳，家中断炊，大哭而死。同村张金然因出麦子六斗，但仅收了三斗，全数缴出只够半数，自缢而死。济生卿张慕桥五甲四户张李氏收麦全数缴出不够，投井自尽。保长常顺因被迫派粮，亦投井自杀。这些“派粮”仅仅是被国民党改编的伪军王自全部的“团粮”，还不是国民党政府的正式的“征粮”“征借”。
    河南一百二十县中受黄苍、风雹、旱灾、蝗灾，及被驻军骚扰的灾区共达九十余县，全省今年麦收不足三成，而驻军（改编伪军，及地方团队不计在内）达七十八万，国民党政府只发三十八万人的粮食，其余均听其“自由谋食”。因此全省赔垫军粮及“副食费”等每月达七十六万万元。以上据官方有统计的数字，“光复”后至今十个月已赔垫七八百万万元。地方的勒索摊派还不在内。至于黄工、堵口工程，原有工程费预算，但委员老爷却连柳枝，材料，木桩都向地方摊派，估计一、四两区“代购”材料木桩约值五十万万元；一、二、四、五、十、十二等六个区各派民夫两万人，每月“垫支”工费一百八十万万元。开工到现在以四个月计即须七百余万万元。上面军粮黄工两项即已榨取了人民一千五百万万元以上。七月十三日，各县人民纷纷组织“灾情哭诉团”赴省请愿，要求将本年度的“征实”“征借”数量予以减少。代表们说：“此数之巨，叫老百姓把粮食全部给了政府还是不够。”然而，国民党当局对哭诉团的呼吁置诸不问。
