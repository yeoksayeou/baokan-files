　　Modernized Giant Water Conservancy Project
　　Completion of the Rongzhen Canal in Quyang
　　Over 4.2 Million Mu of Irrigated Land Added in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in Half a Year of Water Conservancy Construction
    [Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 15th] The main engineering component of the Rongzhen Canal in Quyang, which has been under construction for five summers, was completed in July of this year. This marks the first large-scale modernized water conservancy construction in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. The canal originates at the Diaoyutai Ditch Bank in the Fourth District of Quyang, meandering for more than ten *li* between the mountains of Mushan and Huishan, then running east, cutting through the Yuan Tan Mountain, a mass of chaotic rocks, and flowing straight into the main canal of the Mengliang River. The canal is 85 *li* long, and its branch canals are as dense as spider webs, spreading across the fields. The completed main and branch canals are already able to release water, irrigating a total area of over 40,000 *mu*. The downstream project is expected to be completed by next spring, with the benefited land increasing to over 30,000 *mu*. As early as the 14th year of the Republic of China, the people of Quyang, suffering from drought, had proposed using the Shahe River's water flow for irrigation, but were stymied by the long distance. After the Anti-Japanese War, with the assistance of the democratic government, construction began in the spring of the 28th year amidst frequent warfare. At that time, thousands of laborers participated daily, and all county and district cadres implemented a full-day work assistance system. Construction was interrupted by Japanese invaders, but the construction of dangerous upstream sections was completed within half a year. In October of that year, the Fourth District of Quyang was subjected to a "nibbling" campaign by the Japanese invaders, but canal construction continued in some areas. After the victory of the anti-"nibbling" struggle in the 32nd year, the democratic government provided substantial financial assistance, and construction was continued in sections throughout the county, with earth excavation alone requiring over 500,000 workdays. In order to commemorate General Nie Rongzhen's outstanding contributions to leading and creating the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area, the masses unanimously requested that the canal be named the Rongzhen Canal.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 3rd] The people of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area have successfully completed the massive water conservancy construction project for the first half of this year, adding and restoring 4,229,444 *mu* of irrigated land. According to incomplete statistics from the Jizhong, Jidong, Jinji, and Chahar districts, a total of 557 canals were repaired, 1,061,103 *mu* of land were irrigated, 122 dikes were built (not including the 236 *li* of new dikes in Jizhong), protecting 133,092 *mu* of farmland, and 20 new rivers over 80 *li* long were opened. 2,553,296 *mu* of land were protected and drained from waterlogging, 32 beaches were repaired, and 26,733 *mu* of good farmland were added. According to statistics, the water conservancy projects built in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War can irrigate and protect a total land area of 13,023,537 *mu*. Although the first half of this year encountered severe difficulties such as a lack of construction materials and frequent sabotage and obstruction by Chiang's puppet troops, water conservancy construction was completed, amounting to about one-third of all projects during the Anti-Japanese War.

　　现代化巨大水利建筑
　　曲阳荣臻渠落成
　　晋察冀半年水利建设增水田四百余万亩
    【新华社阜平十五日电】兴修已五度塞暑的曲阳荣臻渠，主要工程部分，于今夏七月落成，此为晋察冀边区内地首次出现的浩大近代化水利建筑。该渠溯源于曲阳四区钓鱼台大沟畔，自穆山麾山山麓间回烧穿行凡十数里，然后东向凿通乱石垒垒的元坦山长流直泻归入孟良河干渠。该渠全长达八十五里，支渠更稠如蛛网，四布于田垄间，全部竣工的干渠支渠，业已先可放水，灌溉面积共四万余亩。下游工程可望于明春竣工，受惠土地可增至三万余亩。溯自民国十四年初，曲阳人民苦旱，曾有利用沙河水流灌溉的提议，困困于路程遥远未果。抗战后经民主政府扶助，于二十八年春在频繁的战争间隙中开始动工，当时每日都有数千民工参加，全县县区干部亦实行整日助工制。中间曾经过日寇阻扰，但仍于半年内完成上游险工多处。是年十月曲阳四区遭日寇“蚕食”，但部分地区的开渠工程，仍在进行。卅二年反“蚕食”斗争胜利后，民主政府以巨额资金扶助，在全县分段续修，仅挖土工程即用工五十余万个。群众为纪念聂荣臻将军领导创造晋察冀解放区的卓越功勋，一致请求命名该渠为荣臻渠。
    【新华社张家口三日电】晋察冀解放区人民，业已胜利完成本年前半年度巨大的水利建设工程，新增及恢复水田四百廿九万四千二百四十四亩。据冀中、冀东、冀晋、察哈尔等区不完全统计，共修整渠道五百五十七条，浇地一百零六万一千一百零三亩，修筑堤坝一百廿二道（不包括冀中新坝二百三十六里在内）护田十三万三千零九十二亩，开辟长八十余里的新河廿道。屏护及脱出水浸地二百五十五万三千二百九十六亩，修滩三十二处，增加良田二万六千七百三十三亩。按晋察冀边区在抗战八年中兴修之水利，可灌溉及屏护土地面积共达一千三百零二万三千五百三十七亩。今年上半年虽遇建筑器材缺乏，蒋伪军频繁的破坏阻挠等严重困难，却完成了约合抗战中全部工程三分之一左右的水利建设。
