Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. Due to the resolute self-defense of the military and civilians in various liberated areas, the Kuomintang army's offensives in Suwan, Central Plains, Shandong, Shanxi and other places have continued to suffer setbacks in the past ten days. Since July, the invaders have lost approximately 100,000 in manpower. The Kuomintang army's reserves have been almost exhausted, and they are now using parachute troops and youth armies to fill the gaps near the front lines. However, the Chiang Kai-shek war group has not yet learned an appropriate lesson from this large-scale civil war that has lasted for more than a month. Chen Cheng publicly declared that he would take the "last resort" and engage in a "military showdown" with the CCP. Chiang ordered all troops to "attack and annihilate the CCP troops with all their strength without waiting for orders" (this order was captured by the Eighth Route Army in a battle near Wenxi). They are expanding the war to more areas. At the end of June and the beginning of July, they took advantage of the Shang'anping incident to launch offensives against Xianghe and Sanhe, opening up the Jidong battlefield, and planned to attack Rehe. At the same time, they bombed Yan'an with eight planes, further provoking the CCP and the people of the whole country.

Suwan Area: Kuomintang army casualties and prisoners of war have reached more than 28,000, equivalent to the entire strength of four divisions of the Kuomintang army. The weapons captured by the New Fourth Army in the area can equip three American-equipped divisions. The Kuomintang army advancing northward along the river has made no progress along the Yangzhou-Taizhou line. On the Taixing-Rugao line, the Kuomintang army's offensive stagnated for a time due to serious losses of 20,000 men. After adjustments and replenishment, they concentrated seven divisions from Rugao to the north and Jiangyan to the east on the 30th of last month, and pounced on Haian Town. After inflicting more than 3,000 casualties on the invaders, the New Fourth Army withdrew from the town on the 2nd of this month. The Kuomintang army is continuing to invade Dongtai. The Fifth Army, which occupied Tianchang in the west, made little progress in attacking Xuyi. The New Fourth Army on the west line of Huaibei launched a powerful counterattack, restoring Baishan Town on the Su (County)-Yong (Cheng) highway and Baiyiji, northwest of Su County. On the east line of Huaibei, Lutuan Town east of Jiagou was restored, and the Kuomintang army that had invaded southeastward from Jiagou was defeated in the Shuanggou area. On the north line of Suwan, the 92nd Division (now renamed the 92nd Brigade) of the Kuomintang army was completely wiped out in Yugou. The Kuomintang army, which invaded along the Longhai Railway, attempted to join forces from Xuzhou and Haizhou in the east and west, cutting off the connection between the Suwan and Shandong liberated areas, but ultimately failed. The New Fourth Army also recovered dozens of villages and towns between Xinpu and Haizhou. At the moment Chiang is again increasing troops from the west line of Longhai to Xuzhou, determined to invade, fierce battles are expected soon on the north line of Suwan. In the rear of the Kuomintang army-occupied areas, local militias and local armed forces have launched guerrilla warfare, closely cooperating with the main forces, attacking, harassing, and killing the invaders, and have recovered many villages and towns. One day, the Rugao local armed forces intercepted 400 boxes of ammunition in a surprise attack.

Shandong Area: The Kuomintang army's attempt to open the Jiaoji Railway has made no progress. The 54th Army, which invaded west of Jiaoxian in the east, retreated to its original position after two battalions were annihilated in Zhilanzhuang. The 73rd Army of the Kuomintang army, which invaded the Zibo area in the central section, is building strongholds in Xipo Town and was attacked by the Eighth Route Army, annihilating one of its battalions and recovering the town. In the west section, after the 12th Army of the Kuomintang army occupied Jiyang City, sixty miles northeast of Jinan, it was strongly counterattacked by the Bohai Eighth Route Army. After changing hands twice, the Eighth Route Army finally recovered the city again on the 25th of last month. The Kuomintang army deeply felt the lack of troops in Shandong and recently transported more than a thousand unarmed soldiers from the youth army who were to be demobilized in the Central Plains to Qingdao. They will be equipped by the United States and put into battle.

Jinchaji and Rehe Areas: Since the Chiang-American army created the Anping Town incident on the 29th of last month, at the beginning of this month the Kuomintang army has invaded the Xianghe and Sanhe liberated areas from three directions: Tongzhou, Anping, and Hexiwu. The 94th Army of the Kuomintang army in the northern route of the eastern line has also been dispatched frequently, attempting to attack Ninghe. The Kuomintang armies of various routes have been effectively resisted by the Jidong Eighth Route Army and the militia, and are currently in a standoff. Rehe, which is closely related to Jidong, since the American army sent the 53rd Army of the Kuomintang army to the Qinhuangdao-Jinzhou line, the Kuomintang army is now planning to attack Gubeikou, Chengde, and Chifeng. There has already been fierce fighting along the Ye (Baishou)-Chi (Feng) line.

Shanxi Area: The important towns of Huairen and Kouquan on the Tongpu Railway in northern Jin have been liberated by the Eighth Route Army in self-defense counterattacks, annihilating more than 1,000 puppet troops. So far, nearly 600 miles of the Tongpu north line from north of Xinxian to south of Huairen has no trace of the enemy or puppets. In the areas of the Jinzhong Plain occupied by Yan's army, mass guerrillas and militia actively cooperated in the battle, and successively removed many newly built important strongholds of Yan's puppet army in Xiaqu, Jicheng, Boyong, Sanquan, Luocheng, and Kangning Fort under the jurisdiction of Fenyang and Wenshui counties. In the southern section of the Tongpu line, the Kuomintang army concentrated four divisions and continued to reinforce two divisions, preparing to continue their northward offensive. After a month of heroic self-defense by the military and civilians in southern Jin, most of the occupied areas have been recovered. The entire line and more than 100 villages and towns on both sides from Maojindu to Zhangdian have been restored, except for Zhangdian. In the southern section of the Tongpu line, the 60-mile line from Dongzhen via Houma to Gaoxian is still being defended by the Eighth Route Army.

Li Xiannian's Breakthrough Troops in the Central Plains: The Pi Dingjun Brigade, which advanced eastward, has safely arrived in the Suwan liberated area. The people's armed forces stationed in western Anhui and eastern Hubei will continue to adhere to self-defense and resistance, and continue to fight bloody battles with those who are encircling and annihilating them. The main force advancing westward shattered the Kuomintang army's nine encirclements and blockades along the way, and has arrived in the mountainous border area of Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei. Due to the iron unity and heroic combat of the people's armed forces, coupled with the care and assistance of the people along the way, despite long marches and multiple battles, they still maintain their original equipment and numbers, with very few losses. The unjust pursuers – the Kuomintang army – have suffered many deserters due to war-weariness, exhaustion, hunger, and popular opposition. Chiang Kai-shek deeply feels that Li Xiannian's troops after the breakthrough have restrained many of his civil war forces, and has transferred forces from other places to continue the "encirclement and annihilation," and fierce battles are about to unfold.

In addition, the Eighth Route Army in the Jiluyu area eliminated the 15,000-strong puppet army of Pang Changzhong and others, who were entrenched in Gaotang. Gaotang County and its entire territory were liberated. At the same time, the Kuomintang puppet army, which occupied the Meng County area in northern Henan after the ceasefire order, launched an offensive against the liberated area with aircraft cover at the beginning of this month. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, annihilating more than 3,000 people. The Kuomintang army's bridgehead fortresses on the north bank of the Yellow River – Qiaotou, Dongzhai, Dianshang, and Zhishu and other important towns – have been removed by the Eighth Route Army, lifting the threat to Mengcheng and Jiyuan, which is also a major victory in the self-defense war during this period.

　　各解放区我军民坚决自卫七月以来进犯军损失十万
    【新华社延安十日电】由于各解放区军民坚决自卫，过去十日中蒋军在苏皖、中原、山东、山西等地之进攻，继续遭受顿挫。自七月以来，进犯者已损失有生力量十万人左右。蒋军后备罗掘殆尽，现正动用降落伞部队及青年军以补接近前线的空虚。但蒋介石好战集团，尚不能在这一个多月的大规模内战中，求得适当的教训。陈诚公开宣称：要走“下策”与中共进行“武力决赛”，蒋命令各部队“对中共部队，应不待命令乘机以全力攻击而歼灭之”（该命令已在闻喜附近战斗中被八路军缴获）。他们正将战争扩展至更多地区。六月底七月初，借上安平事件，向香河、三河进攻，开辟冀东战场，并布置进攻热河。同时以飞机八架轰炸延安，向中共和全国人民进一步挑衅。
    苏皖方面：蒋军伤亡与被俘官兵已达二万八千余人，约等于蒋军四个师的全部兵力。该地新四军所缴获武器，可装备三个美械师。沿江向北进犯之蒋军，其扬州、泰州一线始终无进展，泰兴如皋一线，蒋军因受二万人的严重损耗，攻势一度停滞。经过调整补充后，上月三十日起又集中七个师，自如皋向北，姜堰向东，猛扑海安镇，新四军予进犯者以三千余人之杀伤后，于本月二日撤离该镇。蒋军正继续进犯东台。其西面侵占天长之第五军，图攻盱眙进展甚微。苏皖西线新四军施行有力反击，淮北路西恢复宿（县）永（城）公路上的百善镇，与宿县西北之白义集。淮北路东恢复夹沟以东之路疃镇，击溃由夹沟向东南出犯之蒋军于双沟地区。苏皖北线，蒋军九十二师（现改称九十二旅）于渔沟全部覆没。其沿陇海路出犯之蒋军，企图由徐州、海州东西会合，切断苏皖与山东两大解放区的联络，终未得逞，新四军并收复新浦、海州间村镇数十处，刻蒋又从陇海西线增兵徐州，坚心进犯，苏皖北线不日激战。在蒋军侵占区后方，各地民兵与地方武装已展开游击战争，与主力部队密切配合，袭击困扰杀伤进犯者，并已收复村镇多处。一日如皋地方武装以奇袭截获弹药四百箱。
    山东方面：蒋军企图打通胶济路无进展，东段至胶县西犯之五十四军，在芝兰庄被歼两营后退回原地，中段侵入淄博区之蒋军七十三军，正在西坡镇修筑据点，遭八路军奇袭，歼灭其一个营，并收复该镇。西段蒋军十二军，自侵占济南东北六十里之济阳城后，即遭渤海八路军有力反击，经过两度易手，八路军终于上月二十五日再度恢复该城。蒋军深感山东兵力不足，近又续运青年军两个师之中原拟复员之千余徒手兵抵青，将由美方装备投入战斗。
    晋察冀与热河方面：自上月二十九日蒋美军制造安平镇事件后，本月初蒋军即从通州、安平、河西务三方面，进犯香河、三河解放区，东线北路蒋军九十四军亦纷纷出动，图攻宁河。各路蒋军已遭冀东八路军与民兵有力阻击，正对峙中。与冀东密切关联之热河，自美军将蒋军五十三军送至秦皇岛锦州一线后，现蒋军正在布置进攻古北口、承德、赤峰，叶（柏寿）赤（峰）沿线已有激战。
    山西方面：晋北同蒲路重要城镇怀仁、口泉两地，已为该地八路军在自卫反击中解放，歼灭伪军千余人，至此忻县以北怀仁以南近六百里之同蒲北线，已无敌伪踪迹。晋中平川被阎军侵占地区，群众游击队和民兵积极配合作战，先后拔除汾阳文水等县属之下曲、冀城、渤永、三泉、罗城、康宁堡等阎伪军新建重要据点多处。同蒲线南段，蒋军集中四个师并续增援两个师，准备继续北犯，晋南军民经一月来英勇自卫，已恢复大部被占地区。其由茅津渡至张店一线，除张店以外，全线及两旁村镇百余处均已恢复。同蒲南段，从东镇经侯马至高县六十里一线，仍在八路军坚守中。
    中原李先念突围部队：其东进之皮定钧旅已安全抵达苏皖解放区，留守皖西及鄂东之人民武装，仍将坚持自卫抗击，与围歼者继续血战。其西进主力沿途粉碎蒋军九次围歼与堵击，业已抵达多山之陕豫鄂边。由于人民武装铁的团结与英勇善战，加之沿途人民的爱护帮助，虽经长途行军与多次战斗，仍保持原有之装备与人数，损失甚微。而不义之追击者——蒋军，因厌战疲惫饥饿与人民反对，逃亡甚众。蒋介石深感突围后之李先念部牵制了他的许多内战兵力，已从其他地方上抽调兵力继续“围歼”，即将展开激战。
    此外，冀鲁豫地区八路军铲除盘踞高唐伪军庞长中等部万五千人，高唐县城及其全境获得解放。同时，停战令后侵占豫北孟县地区之蒋伪军，于本月初以飞机掩护向解放区进攻，八路军被迫自卫，将其歼灭三千余人。蒋军黄河北岸之桥头堡垒——桥头、东寨、店上、治戍等重镇，已经被八路军拔除，解除了对孟城、济源的威胁，亦为此一时期自卫战中之一大胜利。
