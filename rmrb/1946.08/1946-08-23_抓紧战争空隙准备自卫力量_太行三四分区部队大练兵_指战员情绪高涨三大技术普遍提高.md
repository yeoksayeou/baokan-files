　　Seize the War Gap to Prepare Self-Defense Forces
　　Taihang Third and Fourth Military Sub-district Troops Conduct Extensive Military Training
　　Commanders and Fighters are in High Spirits; Three Major Techniques are Universally Improved
    [Our newspaper Changzhi News] Under the slogan of "Defending Northern Henan and Preparing for Self-Defense," the various units of the Taihang Third and Fourth Military Sub-districts launched a vigorous military training movement at the end of last month. The directly subordinate teams of the Fourth Military Sub-district began in late July, with all political work and administrative personnel participating in this movement. When the Fourth Military Sub-district carried out military training mobilization in late July, it conducted tests and mobilization of cadres on three major techniques. Every soldier has realized that hard training on the drill ground is also an effort to strive for peace. The civil war launched by the reactionaries has increasingly expanded. We should seize every gap, improve combat effectiveness, and be ready to give the attacking die-hard elements and puppet troops a painful blow at any time. Every soldier of the 44th and 43rd Regiments has put forward the four major guarantees of "no asking for leave, no getting sick, studying with an open mind, and obeying orders." In order to quickly form a upsurge in the movement, the 45th Regiment also held a forum for the 44th Regiment's military training heroes and learning models to exchange experience and call on them to take the lead and help backward elements. The various units of the Third Military Sub-district started earlier, and the officers and soldiers have been working hard together, which has now formed a upsurge. The old heroes of the 44th Regiment's large-scale military training are playing a exemplary backbone role. The old soldiers of the 49th Regiment have all become little teachers. Old soldier Wang Hong practices bayonet fighting with new soldiers under the starlight every day, patiently correcting every movement for them. New soldier Liu Yongxian practices bayonet fighting against the grass target in the moonlight every night. Many military training models have emerged in various units. Wang Honglin, a 19-year-old top-notch sharpshooter of the 50th Regiment, has become a small teacher loved by the masses. Soldier Song Jinglu of the 49th Regiment insisted on going to the training ground even when he was sick. All units are working hard to strive for being a model. According to the winter of 1944 and the spring of last year, the Taihang troops held the first large-scale military training movement, which guaranteed the victory of the large-scale advancement in the summer of last year and the successive self-defense operations. During the large-scale advancement last year, the people enthusiastically joined the army, and the new soldiers in various units increased, which required extensive training. Since the ceasefire, the Taihang Military Region has been preparing for training while demobilizing, but the die-hard army's offensive has never stopped, which has greatly affected the training. Now that the civil war launched by the reactionaries has increasingly expanded, the military region has issued a training order, calling on the entire army to improve its combat effectiveness, defend the liberated areas, and strive for peace.
