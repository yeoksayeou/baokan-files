　　Militia Actively Cooperate with Local Armed Forces
　　Capture Pan Tuo, a Stronghold of the Bai Jin Yan Puppet Regime
    Qi County Women Rise Up to Support the Front Lines
    [This newspaper, Changzhi, 21st dispatch] (Delayed) The local armed forces of Qi County, in coordination with the militia, recovered Pan Tuo Village on the 8th, the only outpost south of Zihongkou of the Yan puppet regime. It is reported that when the Yan puppet troops along the Bai Jin Road fled north at the end of last month, they completely removed the railway tracks south of Zihongkou, strengthened the fortifications of Pan Tuo, and attempted to hold Zihongkou. However, under the siege and harassment of our local armed forces and militia, they finally retreated in defeat on the 8th.
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] Yan Xishan, in violation of the truce agreement, colluded with Japanese puppets to launch a frantic offensive against our liberated areas along the Bai Jin Line. Qi County bore the brunt, and the disasters suffered are beyond words. Driven by an intense desire for survival, the people of the entire county actively cooperated with our army in combat. The women also resolutely fought to defend peace. They said, "To overthrow the reactionaries and achieve peace, we are not afraid of any hardships." In the battle of Zuojiatan, Liu Zhilan and Liu Sinu, women from Nanping, called on the women of the entire village to organize reception stations. As soon as the sound of cannons was heard, they immediately mobilized eggs, some chopping firewood, some carrying water, busy all night without sleep, feeding the soldiers soup and eggs, leading the way for the soldiers, and offering heartfelt comfort to the soldiers as if they were their own brothers. Xue Jialian, a woman from Zhongzhuang, led the women of the village to transport grain and military supplies for the army. He Shuangying, a woman from Bailiangou, had been transporting firewood and military grain with a donkey ever since the Yan army began its offensive. Once, when she was transporting yams from Dongnao to Banyan, the donkey slipped and couldn't walk while climbing the mountain at Quanyu. She carried more than 70 kilograms of yams from the ravine to the top of the mountain, working even harder than a man. Wang Ernu, a woman from Shenling, led the women in boiling water, cooking, and caring for the wounded. She stayed by the soldiers' side, and although her feet were swollen from running, she insisted on not resting. Ma Airong, the wife of Xue Erwa, a representative of Xiaozhuang Village, took on all the work of sending meals, allocating errands, gathering firewood, buying vegetables, boiling water, and making soup after Xue left to support the front line. She worked very energetically. The women of Nanyangquan automatically went to Shenling to comfort the soldiers, carrying 25 kilograms of pears and 68 kilograms of pancakes. They said to the soldiers, "We are sending goose feathers from a thousand miles away, the gift is light but the intention is heavy. This is a token of our women's hearts, please accept it, comrades!" The women of Nanfenggou worked for several nights without sleep. They said, "We are serving to defend peace, and we will be happy even if we die. It is better than anything to drive away the reactionaries." (Cun Tian)
