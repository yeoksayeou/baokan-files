Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. Shanghai Dispatch: After the Chongqing Labor Association case on August 6th, Liu Ningyi, head of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in the Liberated Areas of China and alternate director of the World Federation of Trade Unions, made the following statement to reporters here:

The China Labor Association is a nationwide unified organization of Chinese workers. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it led workers across the country in anti-Japanese work. After the Japanese surrender, it formulated 23 proposals for China's peace and democracy, workers' welfare, and China's industrial construction. It established offices in Chongqing, as well as worker welfare centers, Labor Association hospitals, worker schools, nurseries, and so on. Our liberated areas have 880,000 workers and staff (Note: now there are 1.5 million). For the sake of national peace, democracy, unity, and industrialization, we joined the China Labor Association as a group member. The unified labor movement of Chinese workers, regardless of region, industry, or gender, united under this unified organization to work together, and it was welcomed and praised by the World Federation of Trade Unions. Only Chinese fascist, dictatorial, and war-mongering elements, in order to expand the civil war and maintain their enslavement and exploitation of workers for civil war capital, have intensified their sabotage of workers' unity and have harbored hatred and constant oppression of this organization, finally leading to the illegal and forced "takeover" action of the Chongqing "Federation of Trade Unions" on August 6th. This incident exposed the hideous face of the Chinese fascists. In their view, only their oppression of workers is "legal." Everything else that is beneficial to workers is considered "guilty" and must be "taken over." We believe that the unfortunate incident suffered by the Labor Association this time will arouse the indignation of workers and people of justice across the country and actively support the four demands put forward by the Labor Association: (1) Release the arrested personnel of the Association; (2) Investigate and deal with the instigators of this incident; (3) Demand that the government guarantee human rights, protect the safety of laborers, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future; (4) Demand that the occupiers immediately withdraw from the occupied institutions. Now, people from all walks of life generally believe that the Kuomintang government's so-called "Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions'" brutality is precisely to coordinate with the full-scale civil war and suppress workers. This behavior of the Kuomintang government will endanger other democrats and groups. Therefore, workers and peace-loving democrats across the country must unite more closely and fight for the realization of the four demands!

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. Shanghai Dispatch: After the Chongqing Labor Association was forcibly occupied, Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Labor Association's General Council, in addition to receiving the Shanghai press on the 8th and appealing to all sectors of society, also issued a letter to trade union colleagues and workers on the 12th. The letter stated: "The Labor Association is fighting to organize a strong and independent labor movement for Chinese workers to defend their human rights and social status. It has already sown the seeds of a genuine democratic movement and has been recognized and supported by trade unions around the world. But now we are encountering a crisis, the same crisis faced today by every democrat and liberal in China. The freedom movement is being destroyed, and liberal leaders are facing fears for their lives." Zhu stated in the letter: "Who is the instigator of this attack? It is the person who has uttered his absurd lies, claiming that he will lead China into an era of democratic reform." The letter finally appealed: "Workers, at this moment of life and death, I hope you will give your sympathy. For a just life, we demand justice, we ask you to take action!"

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. Shanghai Dispatch: After the Labor Association incident, letters of condolence from people from all walks of life continued to pour in like snowflakes. Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao, Xiong Foxi, and 63 other people from the cultural circles jointly expressed their condolences on the 16th. More than 20 units of trade unions, such as China Textile, Tongyi, Shenxin, and Yongsheng in the textile industry, and condolence letters from trade unions of hydropower, postal service bureaus, and others, came in one after another. The Chengdu trade unions of various industries also sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Justice, the Central Organization Department of the Kuomintang, and other relevant agencies and organizations of the Kuomintang government regarding the Labor Association case, calling for the protection of labor organizations and the punishment of illegal occupiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. Shanghai Dispatch: On the 12th, the General Council of the Labor Association published in the newspapers here a "Call to the Society Regarding the Forcible Occupation of Affiliated Institutions in Chongqing." After detailing the beginning and end of the Labor Association case and refuting the slanders against the Labor Association, the document stated: "The Association expresses its infinite grief and indignation at this illegal incident! In order to safeguard national dignity, to fight for the freedom of worker organizations, to protect the rights of the people, and for the sake of justice and righteousness, we put forward the following demands: (1) Immediately release the arrested service personnel of the Association; (2) Immediately return all the affiliated institutions of the Association that have been forcibly occupied; (3) Thoroughly investigate and severely punish this illegal incident and its instigators; (4) Request the government to protect the safety of the staff of the Association in accordance with the law and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. Finally, the Association requests the society to pay attention to this illegal incident, accept our appeal, and give us righteous assistance!"

　　刘宁一氏为渝劳协案发表谈话
    当局破坏工运乃配合全面内战
    国人应力争实现劳协四项要求
    朱学范氏吁请全国工人以行动支援
    【新华社南京二十六日电】沪讯：八、六渝劳协案发生后，中国解放区工联筹备会负责人，世界职工会联合会候补理事刘宁一氏，在此间对记者发表谈话如下：
    中国劳动协会是中国工人全国性的统一组织，它在抗战时期即领导全国工人从事抗战工作，日寇投降之后，它又为了中国的和平民主、工人的福利和中国的工业建设制订了二十三条主张，它在重庆设办事处及工人福利社、劳协医院、工人学校、托儿所等。我们解放区有八十八万职工（按：现已有一百五十万），为了国家的和平民主团结和工业化的大计，以团体会员资格参加了中国劳动协会，中国工人的统一运动，从此不分地区、不分产业、不分男女，在这一统一的组织下面团结起来共同努力，并得到了世界职工会联合会的欢迎与赞扬。只有中国法西斯独裁好战分子，为了扩大内战，为了维持他们对工人的奴役与榨取内战资本，才加紧破坏工人的团结，才对于这一组织加以仇视和不断的压迫，终于发生了八月六日重庆“总工会”的非法强迫“接收”行动。这一事件，暴露了中国法西斯分子的狰狞面目。在他们看来，只有他们的压迫工人是“合法”的，此外一切对工人有利的事业，都认为“有罪”，都要“接收”。我们相信此次劳协所遭的不幸事件，将会引起全国工人和正义人士的愤慨，而积极支持劳协所提出的四项要求：（一）释放该会被捕人员；（二）查办此次事件主使人；（三）要求政府保障人权，保障劳工的安全，保证今后不再发生同类事件；（四）要求强占者即行退出被占机构。现在社会人士普遍的认为国民党政府的所谓“渝市总工会”的暴行，正是为了配合全面内战，进行对工人镇压。国民党政府这种行为，将危及其他的民主人士与团体，因此全国工人、全国和平民主人士更不能不紧紧团结，为实现四项要求而斗争！
    【新华社南京二十六日电】沪讯：渝劳协被强占后，劳协总会理事长朱学范氏除于八日招待上海新闻界，向各界呼吁外，并于十二日发表致工会同人暨工友函，该函中称：“劳协为中国工人组织一个强大独立之劳工运动，以保卫其人权及社会地位而奋斗，它已经播下一种真正民主运动的种子，并得到各国工会的承认和支持。而现在我们遭遇了一个危机，和中国每一民主人士及自由主义人士今天所遭遇的危机一样，自由运动被破坏了，自由主义的领袖受到生命的恐惧。”朱氏在函中称：“此种攻击之主使者为谁？其人即系曾经发表其荒诞之谎言，谓将使中国走入一民主改良之时代者也。”该函最后呼吁：“工友们在此生死存亡之际，我希望你们给予同情，为了正当之生活，我们要求正义，我们请求你们行动！”
    【新华社南京二十六日电】沪讯：劳协事件发生后，各界人士慰问劳协函件，续如雪片飞来。文化界郭沫若、茅盾、叶圣陶、熊佛西等六十七人，十六日联名慰问。纺织业中纺、统益、申新、永生等工会二十余单位，水电、邮政局等工会的慰问函，纷至沓来。成都各业工会顷亦以劳协案通电国民党政府行政院、司法部、国民党中央组织部及其他有关机关团体，呼吁保障劳工组织，惩办非法强占人员。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】沪讯：十二日劳协总会在此间报章发表“为重庆附属机构被武力强占事向社会呼吁书”，该件在详述劳协案始末，驳斥对于劳协的诬蔑之后称：“本会对此非法事件表示无限沉痛与愤慨！为了维护国家的尊严，为了争取工人组织的自由，为了维护人民的权利，为了公理与正义，我们提出下列的要求：（一）立即释放本会被捕服务人员；（二）立即退还本会被强占的各附属机构；（三）彻查严惩此次不法事件及其主使者；（四）请政府依法保障本会工作人员之安全，并保证今后不再发生同样之事件。最后，本会要求社会重视此非法事件，接受我们的呼吁，并给我们正义的援助！”
