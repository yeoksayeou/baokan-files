Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th: Shanghai News: The Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference, including more than fifty people's organizations from all walks of life, and the National Peace Movement Conference, recently issued a "Declaration of Freedom Guarantee," stating first: Our victorious country, listed in the democratic camp, does not even have the basic freedom that people in ordinary democratic countries should have. Even groups and individuals engaged in the democratic movement are being subjected to unreasonable and illegal oppression, humiliation, and massacre. Since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, there have been constant atrocities and tragedies against the Political Consultative Conference, against peace, and against democracy, which have negated the promises announced by the Kuomintang authorities themselves with facts, and violated the agreements they themselves agreed to. It is tantamount to announcing the bankruptcy of its own political credibility in front of the people. Anyone without prejudice can see clearly that the series of atrocities and tragedies from the Jiaochangkou Incident to the murder of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were all instructed (explicitly or implicitly) by the Kuomintang authorities, or at least encouraged or condoned by the Kuomintang authorities. The Kuomintang and its government cannot escape their due responsibilities. The declaration pointed out: The basic content of democratic politics is that the people must have the basic freedoms of body, speech, publication, assembly, and association. Without these freedoms, the people are slaves. The declaration strongly stated: The reason why the Chinese people have continued the revolution for fifty years and the War of Resistance Against Japan for eight years, advancing wave upon wave, without hesitation, is to be masters and not slaves anymore. The Chinese people are unwilling to be slaves of the Qing Empire and the Northern Warlords, and they are unwilling to be slaves of Japanese imperialism, and naturally, they are unwilling to be slaves of today's reactionary groups. Whoever wants to force the Chinese people to be slaves again, the Chinese people must fight to the end with them. The declaration finally called on to mobilize the power of the people of the whole country to unanimously demand that the government immediately implement the following matters: (1) Stop the all-out civil war and restore peace; (2) Fulfill the four promises and earnestly guarantee the people's freedom; (3) Implement the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the military reorganization plan, establish a democratic coalition government, convene a democratic National Assembly, and formulate a democratic constitution; (4) Abolish all secret service organizations; (5) All parties jointly organize an investigation committee to thoroughly investigate the truth of all atrocities and tragedies since the Jiaochangkou Incident, severely punish the culprits or murderers, and punish the responsible public security authorities; (6) Comfort all the dead and compensate all the injured for medical expenses and other losses; (7) Release all political prisoners.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: According to the Associated Press, one year after Japan's surrender, China is still marked as a conquered country. The people are panicked, disappointed, and scattered. The economic situation is chaotic, the national treasury is empty, the country continues to suffer from war devastation and division, and the people cannot travel freely within a vast territory. Large areas are still tightly blocked, and floods, famines, and fear permeate the entire country. Although countries have generally recovered, China still maintains a huge standing army. Two-thirds of the country's expenditure belongs to military expenses, and millions of haggard people are struggling with death, without any protection. In this dark scene, the only bright spot is that all parties are calling for the need to achieve democracy, peace and prosperity. However, so far there are only empty words and no reality. According to experts, the main steps to solve China's long-standing problems are: (1) unconditional permanent peace; (2) restoration of transportation; (3) stabilization of the currency system; (4) reduction of donations and taxes; (5) subsidizing domestic industry; (6) strict control of housing and prices; (7) well-organized army. China today spends billions of national currency to maintain a large army engaged in civil war, and even the capital does not have sufficient funds to repair houses. The situation is also quite urgent, and there are no first-class inns for temporary accommodation. The only Western-style hotel in Beijing is occupied by American officers and their secretaries, and non-military personnel are not allowed to enter. The annual rent of the new site of the Nanjing Foreign Correspondents Club is 50 million national currency, which is about 20,000 US dollars, which shows the situation. Although prices are stable, they have not fallen. The cost of an ordinary meal is about 3 US dollars or more. A plain sun hat sells for 25 cents in the United States, but here it costs about 4 US dollars. A bottle of wine costs 1 US dollar, an orange costs 31 cents, and a newspaper costs 12 cents. There are very few brand-new or nearly brand-new cars in Nanjing, mostly Jeeps, military vehicles, delivery trucks of unknown age, and rickshaws. The high price of food has led many civil servants to resign. What will happen to China's economy? This is the most popular guess in Beijing now.

　　上海五十个人民团体呼号
    要做主人不做奴隶
    国民党区弥漫恐惧失望涣散和饥馑
    【新华社南京廿八日电】沪讯：包括五十个以上各界人民团体的上海人民团体联合会与全国和平运动大会，顷发表“自由保障宣言”，首称：我们这个名列民主阵营的战胜国，连普通民主国家人民所应有的起码自由也还没有保障，甚至从事民主运动的团体和人士，正在受着无理非法的压迫、凌辱和惨杀。政治协商会议闭幕以来，不断发生反政协、反和平、反民主的暴行和惨案，以事实否定了国民党当局自己所宣布的诺言，破坏了自己所同意的协议，无异在人民面前宣布自己政治信用的破产。每一个没有成见的人都会看得明白：从较场口事件起直到李公朴、闻一多被害止一连串的暴行和惨案，都是国民党当局所授意（明示或暗示），至少也是国民党当局鼓励或纵容的结果，国民党及其政府，决不能逃避其应负的责任。宣言中指出：民主政治的起码内容，就是人民必须有身体、言论、出版、集会、结社的基本自由，得不到这些自由，人民就是奴隶。宣言力称：中国人民继续五十年的革命和八年的抗战，前仆后继，义无反顾的原因，就是要做主人，不要再做奴隶。中国人民既不愿做满清帝国和北洋军阀的奴隶，又不愿意做日本帝国主义的奴隶，自然也不愿做今日反动集团的奴隶。谁要强迫中国人民再做奴隶，中国人民一定要跟谁斗争到底。宣言中最后号召发动全国人民的力量，一致要求政府立即实行以下诸事：（一）停止全面内战，恢复和平；（二）履行四项诺言，切实保障人民自由；（三）执行政协五项决议及整军方案，成立民主的联合政府，召开民主的国民大会，制定民主的宪法；（四）取消一切特务组织；（五）各党派共同组织调查委员会，彻查较场口事件以来一切暴行惨案的真相，严办祸手或凶手，并惩办负责的治安当局；（六）抚恤一切死者，赔偿一切伤者的医药费及其他损失；（七）释放一切政治犯。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据联合社报导：日本投降后一年，中国仍为被征服国家之记号，人民惶惑、失望、涣散、经济情形混乱、国库空虚，国家继续遭受战争摧残与分裂，人民在广大的幅员内不能自由往来，大片地方仍遭紧密封锁，洪水、饥馑与恐惧弥漫全境。各国虽然相率复员，而中国仍维持庞大的常备军，国家支出三分之二属于军费，数百万面目憔悴之人民则与死亡挣扎，一无保护。在此黑暗景象中，其唯一光明之点，殆为各方面皆在高呼必须达到民主和平与繁荣。惟迄今只有空言，并无实际。如欲解决中国积弊，据专家意见，其主要步骤为：（一）无条件永久和平；（二）恢复交通；（三）稳定币制；（四）减轻捐税；（五）补助本国工业；（六）房屋、物价严行管制；（七）所编军队。中国今日不惜以数十亿国币，维持大军从事内战，而于首都亦无充分款项修理房屋，情形亦颇紧急，且无头等客寓可供假宿，京中唯一西式旅馆，由美国军官及其秘书占住，不准非军人入内。南京外国记者俱乐部新址，其全年租金为国币五千万元，约合美金二万元，即此可见一斑。物价虽平，但未降落，平常一餐之费，约需美金三元以上，便服太阳帽一顶，在美国售两角五分，此间须合到美金四元左右。一瓶酒需美金一元，一只橘子三角一分，报纸需一角二分，南京全新汽车或近乎全新之汽车甚少，大多数为吉普车，兵器车，不知年龄之运货车与人力车。食物价昂，致公务员多愿去职。中国经济将于何为底里尽露，此为现在京中最风行之猜测。
