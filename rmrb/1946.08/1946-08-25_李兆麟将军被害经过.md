The Harbin authorities have recently released details of the assassination of Northeast anti-Japanese hero General Li Zhaolin (Zhang Shoujian). Since the arrest of the perpetrators Ma Jianchen, Gao Qingsan, and others, repeated interrogations have proven that this case was entirely a planned and organized conspiracy by the Kuomintang secret service. The main culprits who directly commanded and arranged this assassination were Yu Xiuhou, the Kuomintang Harbin Police Chief, He Shiying, the chief of the Kuomintang Military Statistics Bureau’s Binjiang Organization Section, Yan Zhongzhang, the leader of the commando unit, and the special agent Sun Geling. Those who participated in the assassination were their secret service henchmen, the remnants of the puppet army, traitors, and bandits Ma Jianchen, Gao Qingsan, Yan Dawei, Liu Xixian, Liu Wensheng, Sun Haijing, and many others.

When the Kuomintang "took over" Harbin, General Li Zhaolin, with the utmost sincerity, resigned from his position as Deputy Chairman of the Songjiang Provisional Provincial Government and served exclusively as the Chairman of the Harbin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in order to cooperate with the Kuomintang in Harbin and jointly seek peace in the Northeast. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries regarded him as their greatest enemy and were determined to kill him. He had long been listed as the number one target on the Kuomintang Military Statistics Bureau's "Bin Group" (Binjiang Organization Section) blacklist. After Yu Xiuhou took office as Police Chief, he took on the dual role of executing this conspiracy plan. Lin Zaichun, the head of the Harbin Military Statistics Bureau's secret service, introduced Yu Xiuhou as a Major General of the Military Statistics Bureau, the highest responsible person for Chiang Kai-shek's secret service in Harbin, at the swearing-in ceremony of the commando unit. Yu told his secret service henchmen in his speech, "In the future, what the police station cannot do, you must do...". Later, after Lin Zaichun left, Yu Xiuhou directly led and organized this assassination. Under Yu Xiuhou's orders, the special agent He Shiying established secret service organs all around the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and General Li Zhaolin's residence. They once attempted to assassinate General Li Zhaolin at a rally at the Modern Hotel, but the plot failed due to the strict Soviet military guards. Therefore, the secret service bandits set up an assassination mechanism at No. 9 Shuidao Street – the residence of commando member Sun Haijing. First, Yang Chuoan, the Kuomintang Mayor of Harbin, repeatedly invited Li Zhaolin to walk from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to the Huafenglou Restaurant, passing in front of the assassination mechanism, thereby exposing Li Zhaolin's face for the secret agents to recognize. At the same time, in order to make General Li habitually take walks, a special agent Sun Geling – an employee of Yang Chuoan's municipal government, who was introduced to Li Zhaolin by Yang – infiltrated the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, gaining the opportunity to interact with General Li Zhaolin.

On March 7th, the special agents gathered at the Balas Hotel and agreed to assassinate General Li Zhaolin at Sun Haijing's house on the 8th. That day, Sun Geling went to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to report important matters to General Li Zhaolin, and said that he wanted to arrange a secret talk with ××× at No. 9 Shuidao Street. At that time, General Zhaolin did not go due to some matters, so the special service bandits changed the assassination plan to the next day. On the 9th, the murder was arranged more meticulously. At noon, the special agents first gathered at ×××'s place, and then went to Sun's house. Sun Xixian contacted the × platoon leader of the Tieshi unit of the opposite garrison for mutual cooperation. The special agent Liu Wensheng put poison in the kettle. He Shiying directed the wiping of footprints on the floor on the spot, leaving Sun Geling in the room, while the murderers Yan Zhongzhang, Gao Qingsan, and Meng Qingyun hid in the corridor room next door. In addition, bandits such as Ma Jianchen, Liu Xixian, and Liu Wensheng were arranged to patrol outside, responsible for capturing General Li Zhaolin's guards. Just then, General Li Zhaolin came out of Comrade Zhong Ziyun's place. He had said that he was going to an appointment with an important person ×××. On the way, due to a car malfunction, he left the guards to watch the car being repaired. He took a horse-drawn carriage back to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and hurriedly told his secretary, "I'm going to No. 9 Shuidao Street," and left alone. At about half-past four, General Li was first poisoned. The special agents agreed to use shouting "Have another bowl!" and knocking on the table as a signal. Yan Zhongzhang led bandits Meng Qingyun and Gao Qingsan out of the corridor room, first searched General Zhaolin for his pistol, and then took a sharp knife and stabbed him seven times (eight holes). This national hero, who persisted in the Northeast Anti-Japanese War for fourteen years and did not die in the enemy's hail of bullets, was deprived of his life in the vile assassination by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents.

After the thugs committed the crime, they planned to chop up the body, put it in sacks, transport it away, and throw it into the river to eliminate traces. The Soviet military originally notified Yu Xiuhou to send a detective team to No. 9 Shuidao Street to search at 9:00 a.m. the next day, entirely to cover up the plan to move the body, but delayed the notification to the detective team until 2:00 p.m. the next day. The next morning, the special agent Liu Xixian openly wore a police uniform, carrying two pistols, and took a horse-drawn carriage to Shuidao Street to move the body. On the way, the Soviet military on alert searched out the guns, and the bandit Liu was sent to Yu Xiuhou's place, but Yu Xiuhou released him. At the same time, during this period, Yu Xiuhou maintained close contact with the murderous special agents, so most of the special agent bandits escaped. Despite their actions being so secretive, their criminal behavior could not be hidden. When Sun Haijing's house was initially searched, He Shiying's diary was discovered, which provided important clues about the situation of the secret service organ and the main persons responsible for the assassination. In addition, the special agents had promised to use 100,000 yuan to buy off Gao Qingsan, but only gave 4,000 yuan, so secrets were constantly leaked. Under the observation of the public, the Democratic Allied Forces finally captured the criminals not long after entering Harbin. Ma Jianchen, Gao Qingsan, and others confessed all the details of the case. Now that the criminals have been captured and the truth has been revealed, the Northeast public opinion is continuing to accuse the Kuomintang secret service organs of their heinous crimes to the people of the country and the world, and demands that the Kuomintang authorities repay this blood debt!

　　李兆麟将军被害经过
    哈尔滨当局顷发表东北抗日英雄李兆麟（张寿篯）将军被暗杀案的详情。自凶犯马建臣、高庆三等就捕后，经多次侦讯，已证明此案是完全出于国民党特务机关有计划有组织的阴谋，直接指挥和布置这一暗杀的主凶，乃是国民党哈尔滨警察局长余秀豪，以及国民党军统局滨江组织科科长何士英、别动队长阎钟璋、特务孙格玲等，参加暗杀的则有他们的特务爪牙伪军余孽汉奸土匪马建臣、高庆三、阎大维、刘希贤、刘文升、孙海镜等多人。
    当国民党“接收”哈市时，李兆麟将军不惜以最大诚意辞去松江临时省政府副主席职务，专任哈市中苏友好协会会长，以便在哈与国民党合作，共谋东北的和平。然而国民党反动派却把他看作最大仇人，一定要杀之而后快。在国民党军统局“滨组”（滨江组织科）的黑名单上早就将他列为第一名。当余秀豪出任警察局长后，他更一身而二任的执行这个阴谋计划。哈市军统局特务头子林再春，曾在别动队的宣誓典礼上介绍余秀豪是军统局的少将，哈尔滨的蒋介石特务最高负责人。而余氏则在训话中告诉特务爪牙说：“今后警察局不能作的事，要靠你们来作………”。以后林再春离去，余秀豪便直接领导组织这一暗杀。由于余秀豪的授命，特务何士英在中苏友好协会及李兆麟将军的住宅附近遍设特务机关，他们曾企图在马迭尔饭店的一次集会上刺杀李兆麟将军，当时由于苏军警戒森严，阴谋未逞。于是特务匪徒便在水道街九号——别动队员孙海镜的住所布置好暗杀机关。先是国民党哈尔滨市长杨绰庵几次邀李兆麟徒步由中苏友好协会走到华丰楼饭馆去吃饭，道经暗杀机关门前，借此暴露李兆麟面目，给特务认识。同时为了麻痹李将军常作徒步行动，并用一个由他介绍李兆麟相识的特务孙格玲——杨绰庵市府的职员，混进中苏友好协会，取得与李兆麟将军来往的机会。
    三月七日，特务们就在巴拉斯旅馆集合，约定八日在孙海镜家谋杀李兆麟将军。那天孙格玲曾往中苏友好协会向李兆麟将军报告重要事项，并谓要和×××约李去水道街九号密谈，当时兆麟将军因事未去，特务匪徒乃将暗杀计划改为翌日。九日的谋杀布置得更加周密，正午时特务们先在×××处集合，然后到了孙家，由孙希贤和对面驻军铁石部队×连长取的联络，互相策应。特务刘文升在水壶中放下了毒药，当场由何士英指挥擦去地板上的脚印，将孙格玲留在房内，杀人犯阎钟璋、高庆三、孟庆云则隐藏在邻室的廊房里。另外布置马建臣、刘希贤、刘文升等匪徒在外巡风，担任捉拿李兆麟将军的警卫员。这正是李兆麟将军由钟子云同志处出来，他曾说：自己赴要员×××处约会。途中由于汽车损坏，留下警卫员看着修理车子，他坐了马车回到中苏友好协会后，匆匆的仅交待他的秘书一句：“我到水道街九号。”就只身而去，约在四时半左右，李将军先被毒药毒倒，特务约定以喊“再喝一碗吧”，和敲桌为记，阎钟璋率领孟庆云、高庆三等匪徒由廊房出来，先搜了兆麟将军的手枪，拿起利刀在他身上连刺七刀（八孔），这位坚持十四年东北抗战没有死在敌人枪林弹雨中的一代民族英雄，就在蒋介石特务卑劣的暗杀中被夺去了生命。
    暴徒行凶以后，计划将尸体砍断以麻袋装上运走掷于江中，以消灭痕迹。苏军本通知余秀豪于次日晨九时派侦缉队到水道街九号搜查，全为掩饰移尸计划，竟拖延至次日下午二时始通知侦缉队。第二天的早晨，特务刘希贤公然穿着警察制服，带两支手枪，坐着马车到水道街去移尸，途中被警戒的苏军搜出枪支，刘匪被送到余秀豪处，而余秀豪竟将他放走。同时在此期间，余秀豪和行凶的特务一直保持着密切的联系，因此特务匪徒遂大部漏网。尽管他们的行动如此诡密，他们的罪恶行为依然掩藏不住。当最初搜查孙海镜家时就发现何士英遗留的日记，关于特务机关的情况以及参加暗杀的主要负责人等都提供了重要的线索。此外特务们曾经答应用十万元收买高庆三，结果却只给了四千元，于是秘密便不断泄露。在众目昭彰之下，民主联军终于在进驻哈市后不久，就先将凶犯捕获了。马建臣、高庆三等均供出全部案情。现在凶犯就擒，真相大白，东北舆论界正在继续向全国及全世界人士控诉国民党特务机关的滔天罪行，并要求国民党当局偿还这一笔血债！
