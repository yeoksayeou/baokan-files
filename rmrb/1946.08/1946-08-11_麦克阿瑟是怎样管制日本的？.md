　　How MacArthur Controlled Japan
    Mo Ye

　　It has been a full year since the Soviet Union declared war, and the Japanese bandits surrendered. The signing ceremony of Japan's surrender was held on the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on September 2 last year. This "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof" empire can be said to have reached "the setting sun." However, international democrats concerned with peace have proposed that they must be vigilant and prevent its "Fusang resurgence." The Potsdam Proclamation and the decisions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference regarding the basic principles for dealing with the Japanese issue are: it is essential to permanently eradicate the militarism that deceives and misleads the Japanese people into their desire to conquer the world, and to establish a responsible and democratic government that is inclined towards peace based on the freely expressed will of the Japanese people.

    Based on this basic principle, examining MacArthur's policies and measures for controlling Japan over the past year, it is evident that they distort and violate the basic principles of the Potsdam Declaration and the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference decisions. To put it more solemnly, it is a kind of sabotage and betrayal. MacArthur not only did not devote himself to thoroughly destroying Japanese militarism and supporting the democratic movement of the Japanese people, but on the contrary, consciously protected and even condoned the revival of Japanese fascist militarism, while suppressing and destroying the democratic movement of the Japanese people to a high degree.

    Facts are the most eloquent witness.

    First, let's take a look at how MacArthur supported the Japanese sham election in April this year. When the Far Eastern Commission discussed the Japanese general election at the end of March, New Zealand representative Berendsen advocated postponing it, arguing that "in order for left-wing parties to have the opportunity to educate the Japanese people in a democratic spirit, the election should be postponed for at least six months. Democrats are completely unprepared for the campaign, while parties representing the old system are well-organized, financially well-off, and supported by the current government." The Soviet representative also agreed with this view, but in the end, due to MacArthur's insistence on opposition and the passage by a majority of the attending representatives, this "dissent" was virtually eliminated. In the April election, politicians from the Progressive Party, the Liberal Party, and the Socialist Party used more than 30 million yuan in activity funds provided by the zaibatsu to conduct large-scale bribery, create a large number of puppet organizations, form an anti-democratic front, and launch an anti-communist and anti-democratic movement throughout the country, using threats and inducements, with heavy shadows. MacArthur, who had the power to stop it, turned a blind eye and allowed Japanese monopoly capital and its agents to do whatever they wanted. When Japanese democratic forces and international public opinion condemned and opposed this sham election, MacArthur even issued a statement saying that "such condemnations will not be allowed." Under his vigorous support, about a hundred notoriously fascist militarists became members of parliament, and the reactionary Shidehara government was legalized.

    Although Shidehara has been forced out, his successor, Yoshida, is still a war criminal cabinet representing the interests of the zaibatsu. He had helped the Japanese warlord group invade China, and he had participated in the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Yoshida came to power due to Shidehara's recommendation and with MacArthur's approval, but the broad masses of the Japanese people did not approve of him. In order to demand the establishment of a democratic government and solve the serious food problem, the Japanese people held a mass rally of 250,000 people in front of the Imperial Palace on May 19 and marched in demonstration. At that time, the US military mechanized units near the Imperial Palace removed their gun covers and were ready for battle, suppressing the demonstrators. How "distinct" is MacArthur's "love and hate" for the reactionary rulers of Japan and the Japanese people who demand democracy and bread!

    Emperor-centrism is the "unique theory" of the Japanese fascist movement. The so-called "clarification of the national polity" has been the basis of the political programs of many fascist groups. That is to say, the Emperor once existed as the "living god" of Japanese militarism, which carried out aggression. Understanding this, it is not difficult to understand why the Japanese bandits still "attached the condition of maintaining the Emperor as the supreme ruler" when they finally surrendered; on the other hand, it can be seen how important the insistence of the Japanese Communist Party on abolishing the Emperor system is to completely eradicate the future resurgence of Japanese militarism.

    The American National Lawyers Association once sent a letter to Truman, advocating the arrest of Emperor Hirohito and his trial as a war criminal. The righteousness was awe-inspiring and attracted worldwide attention. However, the chief prosecutor of the Far East International Tribunal publicly stated that the Emperor need not be considered a war criminal and brought to trial. MacArthur's "care" for the Emperor can be described as "meticulous"!

    This is not inconceivable. MacArthur's intention is to control Japan "through the Emperor," and the Japanese reactionary ruling clique, whose ambition has not died and is plotting a comeback, must preserve the Emperor as a banner for enslaving the people and rebuilding the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Therefore, at this moment when the Emperor system is at stake, they unanimously need to affirm the Emperor's position. This common requirement is embodied in the new Japanese constitution drafted by Shidehara and approved by MacArthur. In the Japanese constitution, which is modeled on the Prussian constitution, the Emperor's power is extremely broad. The Emperor is of an unbroken line and is supreme. The political privileges of the Emperor stipulated by the constitution are basically untouched in the new constitution, stipulating that the Emperor is hereditary and considering him "the symbol of Japanese integration." The House of Peers was renamed the House of Councillors, but it is still the same old wine in a new bottle. The so-called House of Councillors is just a new type of House of Peers that reduces the authority of the House of Representatives. Despite the use of some ambiguous and flickering words, it ultimately cannot conceal the reactionary essence of the new constitution, which is to preserve the dictatorship of the zaibatsu landlords and bureaucrats. The Far Eastern Commission issued a statement in May: "The implementation of the new Japanese constitution must guarantee that the finally promulgated constitution is indeed an expression of the free will of the Japanese people." Regarding the issue of reforming the Japanese constitution, MacArthur neither consulted with the Far Eastern Commission nor discussed it with representatives of the Allied powers. Such a unilateral action is completely contrary to the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference.

    Regarding the handling of Japanese war criminals, MacArthur also tried his best to be lenient, repeatedly postponing the trial. The director of the "Greater East Asia Holy War" - war criminal Tojo - was even able to eat delicacies and read pictorials sent by air from San Francisco in prison. War criminal Doihara, who is well-known to Chinese women and children, was able to rant and quibble in the Far East International Tribunal, turning the war criminal trial court into a forum for propagating Japanese fascist militarism. Moreover, several zaibatsu who had been included in the list of war criminals, such as Mitsui's Ikeda, Fujiwara, and textile and shipping tycoons Ida, have all been removed from the list of war criminals.

    In addition to supporting the reactionary ruling clique of Japan politically, MacArthur also made every effort to help the revival of the old forces economically. For example, American investment in the textile industry, the supply of American cotton, assistance in silk exports, handing over the merchant fleet to private companies, opposing the Soviet representative's suggestion to revise the Japanese labor law, rejecting the workers' demand for production management rights, and allowing Japanese fishing boats to fish in Chinese territorial waters, all indicate that he is planning for the Japanese zaibatsu. According to a report by a Chicago Sun reporter: "Professor Edward, during his visit to Japan, drafted a plan advocating the dissolution of the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda zaibatsu, as well as the monopolistic industries of other zaibatsu, and preventing them from rising again after the end of the United Nations occupation. MacArthur submitted a report to Washington in early July, criticizing Edward's opinion of dissolving the zaibatsu, opposing any drastic measures against the zaibatsu at present, because any directive to deal with the zaibatsu would put the Yoshida cabinet in a difficult situation." (⑴⑵)

    At present, the situation of land concentration in Japan remains the same. Taking the Emperor alone, he has 54,000 cho of cultivated land and 1.3 million cho of forest (1 cho is equivalent to more than 10 Chinese mu). Land reform is an indispensable part of the democratization process, which is one of the most important terms of the Allied powers' acceptance of Japan's unconditional surrender. Without land reform, it would not be possible to solve the serious food problem well. When the Allied Council for Japan discussed the issue of Japanese land reform in June, the Soviet representative suggested that the Japanese government confiscate the land of "absentee landlords" (that is, parasitic landlords who live in cities indulging in pleasure) and establish a land fund to provide loans to farmers to purchase land from local landlords, stipulating that landlords should not own more than 3 cho of land, and the remaining land should be transferred to farmers with compensation. This fair and reasonable proposal was rejected by the US representative Acheson as "violating the sacred right to private property" (?). As a result, the compromise plan of the British representative was adopted - stipulating that the state should buy tenant-cultivated land and sell it to farmers. This plan is just "drawing cakes to satisfy hunger." It is more difficult to implement land reform with it than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.

    Regarding the work of eradicating Japanese fascist militarist ideology, MacArthur also feigned compliance. Although he once issued an order to abolish Shintoism in a seemingly serious manner, when the Soviet representative proposed at the Allied Council for Japan to ban fascist books (especially Hitler's *Mein Kampf*), the US occupation authorities came out to protect the "freedom of thought and speech" of Japanese reactionary elements. US Communist leader Foster once said: "MacArthur is a reactionary with fascist tendencies."

    Since the reactionary ruling clique of Japan is so protected, accommodated, supported, and promoted, then the broad masses of the Japanese people who demand democracy must inevitably and in fact have been intimidated, suppressed, attacked, and destroyed. The American army protects the Imperial Palace and the Prime Minister's official residence, not allowing the masses to petition; when the masses carry out hunger marches, the American army will threaten and interfere, with tanks and cavalry dispatched together, removing their gun covers as if facing a formidable enemy. Three days after the large demonstration of 250,000 people in Tokyo on May 18, MacArthur issued a reactionary statement: "The overt threats now being employed by lawless elements (?) will not be allowed to continue for long. If a minority (?) in Japanese society no longer exercises self-restraint and self-respect, I will have no choice but to take necessary steps to control them." On June 18, the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Yoshida Cabinet issued an imperial order saying: "According to the directive of MacArthur Headquarters on rectifying bad organizations, all political organizations that have not registered with the relevant government agencies will be dissolved." The mutual use and collusion between MacArthur and the Emperor can be seen from this.

    Why, after the Japanese bandits attacked Pearl Harbor, did the United States "share the same hatred" against Japan, determined to "destroy this enemy," but now that MacArthur has firmly occupied the three islands of Sakura, he can "not remember the old grievances" and be so "magnanimous" to Japanese war criminals and the entire reactionary ruling clique? The answer to this question is very simple. MacArthur's personal inclinations cannot completely determine the US policy towards Japan. All of MacArthur's measures to control Japan are the concrete manifestations of the US reactionary imperialist group's policy towards Japan. What is the current policy of the American imperialist group towards Japan? In simple terms, it is: to control Japan through the Emperor, to support a comprador government, to suppress the democratic movement of the people, to turn Japan into a US vassal, and to use it as a vanguard and base for anti-Sovietism. According to Brigadier General Thorpe, head of the counterintelligence group at MacArthur Headquarters: "The Allied occupation must last for up to 20 years to achieve the expected results." Its far-sightedness is not difficult to imagine. Only by clearly understanding the strategic intention of the American imperialists can all of MacArthur's measures to control Japan be answered.

    However, subjective wishes are often ridiculed and shattered by developing objective facts. After the First World War, reactionary British rulers such as Chamberlain insisted on the reactionary policy of supporting Germany and suppressing France to oppose the Soviet Union. Later, with the addition of Daladier, they jointly directed a tragedy of Munich, which ultimately led to the defeat of Dunkirk and the fall of France. If it were not for the heroic Soviet Red Army giving the Hitler bandits a powerful blow, the British Isles would probably have raised the "＠①" flag long ago. Not only have the reactionary "appeasers" reaped their own evil consequences, but also countless millions of peaceful people in Europe and even the world have suffered the scourge of war! Under the "appeasement policy," Germany could produce Hitler. Under MacArthur's policy towards Japan, is it impossible to produce a second Tojo? The American authorities should remember this painful historical lesson.

    Although the inevitable collapse of Japanese fascist imperialism is a historical destiny, it announced its surrender only two days after the Soviet Union sent troops, and did not make every effort to make a "last-ditch fight" to prolong its life. This originally contained a huge conspiracy. This conspiracy is to retain some strength and prepare to take the opportunity to rise again. The reactionary forces in Japan were indeed panicked at the beginning of the surrender because they did not know what kind of fate they would suffer under American control. After seeing the intentions of the United States, they calmed down and increased their confidence. Konoe has contributed greatly to this transformation. From Shidehara to Yoshida, they all adopted Konoe's political line, which is to "falsely cooperate" with MacArthur, deliberately showing obedience, using MacArthur's use of them while using MacArthur; on the other hand, "disintegrating into parts" and "secretly advancing troops from Chencang." This war did not reach the Japanese mainland, and the damage to Japanese production institutions and industrial equipment is far less than what the newspapers and magazines publicized and exaggerated. American Pauley recently went to Japan for inspection. According to his statistics, the Japanese textile industry can now start operating immediately and can reach one-fifth of its pre-war level. All other industrial equipment can have a production volume of one-quarter of its pre-war level. It is already considerable to have recovered to such an extent in less than a year, not to mention that a large amount of wealth, munitions, and means of production must have been hidden. As for the various underground conspiracy activities of the Japanese fascist militarist forces, it is also an open secret. At the Allied Council for Japan, US officials had to admit that "this is a fact." Under the guise of democracy, many "extremely patriotic" political parties and social groups have been established one after another. Recently, Omura, the Minister of Home Affairs of the Yoshida Cabinet, declared in the parliament: "15 million yuan will be used in the government budget to expand the police force and improve the treatment of the police." Omura admitted that the current number of police is greater than that of the occupation forces, but he still insisted that the police organization must be expanded. At the same time, it has recently been discovered in various parts of Japan that some schools are implementing compulsory military training. The ambition of Japanese fascist militarism to "make a comeback" is as clear as fire.

    The greater the pressure, the greater the resistance. Despite the fact that MacArthur and the reactionary ruling clique of Japan are working together to put high pressure on the Japanese democratic movement, the broad masses of the Japanese people who are fighting for democracy and food, under the leadership of the democratic front with the Japanese Communist Party as the backbone, are fighting unyieldingly. Since May, a series of marches and demonstrations have fully demonstrated the strength and growth of the democratic forces of the Japanese people. The labor group organized by the Japanese Socialist Party - the General Federation of Labor - has recently expanded into a national organization with a total membership of 855,000 people due to the participation and leadership of the party's left-wing leader Kanji Kato and others, accepting the Japanese Communist Party's proposal to establish a unified labor front. This is not only a new milestone in the history of the Japanese labor movement, but also a signal that the current Japanese democratic movement will therefore become increasingly high! In the future, the struggle between democracy and anti-democracy in Japan will inevitably become increasingly acute, and the struggle tasks of the Japanese people are very complex and arduous. But it is certain that those who will ultimately determine the fate of Japan will not be the reactionary MacArthur, Hirohito, Shidehara, and Yoshida, but the Japanese people themselves!

　　麦克阿瑟是怎样管制日本的？
    漠野
　　苏联宣战，日寇投降，转眼是整整一年了。去年九月二日在东京湾的密苏里旗舰上举行了日本投降的签字典礼，这个“八弦一宇”的帝国可谓“日落崦嵫”了，然而，关心和平的国际民主人士们却曾提出必须警惕与防范其“扶桑再起”。波茨顿会议的公告，莫斯科三强外长会议的决议，关于处理日本问题的基本原则，就是：必须永久铲除欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界的军国主义，依据日本人民自由表示的意志成立一个倾向和平的负责的民主政府。
    根据这个基本原则，来检验一下麦克阿瑟一年来的对日管制政策及其措施，显而易见的是歪曲与违反了波茨顿宣言与莫斯科外长会议决定的基本原则，说得更郑重一点，就是一种破坏与背叛。麦克阿瑟不但没有致力于彻底摧毁日本军国主义，赞助日本人民的民主运动，相反的是意识的地庇护甚至纵容着日本法西斯军国主义的复活，而对于日本人民的民主运动却加以高度的抑制与摧残。
    事实是最雄辩的见证者。
    首先，看一看麦克阿瑟是怎样支持了今年四月间的日本伪选。在三月底远东委员会讨论日本大选问题的时候，纽西兰代表贝伦特逊曾主张从缓举行，他认为：“为使左翼各党得有机会以民主精神教育日本人民起见，选举至少须展期六个月。民主份子对于竞选毫无准备，而代表旧制度的政党则组织良好，经济充足，并得现政府之支持”，苏联代表也同意这个意见，但结果终于因麦克阿瑟的坚持反对和出席代表多数的通过，这个“异议”无形打消了。在四月的大选中，进步党、自由党、与社会党的政客们，借财阀供给的三千多万元活动费，大规模进行贿选，大批制造御用团体，结成反民主阵线，在全国各地展开反共反民主运动，威胁利诱，黑幕重重；而具有权力予以制止的麦帅竟熟视无睹，放任日本独占资本及其代理人为所欲为。当日本民主力量与国际舆论纷纷谴责与反对这个伪选的时候，麦克阿瑟竟然发表谈话，说“决不允许发生这种谴责”。在他这样的大力支持之下，一百个左右的劣迹昭著的法西斯军国主义分子当了议员，而反动的币原政府也就得以合法化了。
    币原虽然已经被迫滚蛋了，但继之而起的吉田，却仍然是一个代表财阀利益的战犯内阁。他曾帮助过日本军阀集团侵略中国，他曾参加了反共公约的签订。吉田登台是由于币原的推荐，经过了麦克阿瑟的批准，可是，广大的日本人民是并没有批准他的。日本人民为了要求建立民主政府和解决严重的粮食问题，于五月十九日在日皇宫前举行了二十五万人的群众大会，并游行示威，当时皇宫附近的美军机械化部队，卸去炮衣，如临大敌，对示威群众予以镇压。麦帅对于日本反动的统治者和要求民主与面包的日本人民，是多么“爱憎分明”呵！
    天皇中心主义，是日本法西斯运动的“独特的理论”，所谓“国体明征”，曾为许多法西斯团体政治纲领的基本。这就是说，天皇是曾经作为侵略的日本军国主义之“活的神灵”而存在的。明乎此，就不难了解为什么日寇当最后乞降的时候还要“附有保持天皇为最高统治者之条件”；另一方面，也就可以看出日本共产党之所以坚持主张废除天皇制，是如何重大地攸关着彻底根绝日本军国主义今后的再起。
    美国全国律师协会曾经致函杜鲁门，主张逮捕日皇裕仁，并以战犯付审。义正词严，举世瞩目。可是，远东国际法庭首席检查官却公开声明，天皇不必视同战犯到庭受审。麦帅之于天皇，可谓“爱护备至”矣！
    这是并非不可思议的，麦克阿瑟的意图是“通过天皇”控制日本，而野心未死图谋卷土重来的日本反动统治集团，更须保存天皇作为奴役人民与再建“大东亚帝国”的旗帜，从而，在目前这个天皇制度安危所系的当儿，他们便一致地需要将天皇的地位予以肯定，这个共同的要求，在币原起草业经麦克阿瑟批准的日本新宪法中体现出来了。在以普鲁士宪法为蓝本的日本宪法中，天皇的权力是极为广大的，天皇是万世一系的，是至尊无上的。被宪法所规定的天皇的政治特权，在新宪法中基本上是原封未动，明定天皇世袭，并认为“日本统合的象征”。贵族院改名为参议院，换汤不换药，所谓参议院只不过是缩小众议院权限的新式贵族院而已。尽管运用一些暧昧闪烁的词句，但终于掩盖不了新宪法之反动的实质，它的实质就是保存财阀地主和官僚的专政。远东委员会于五月间曾发表声明：“规定日本新宪法之施行，必须能保证最后颁布之宪法确系日本人民自由意志的表现。”关于改革日本宪法的问题，麦克阿瑟既未同远东委员会磋商，也没有与盟国代表研讨，这样一意孤行，是完全违背了莫斯科外长会议之决议的。
    关于日本战犯的处理，麦克阿瑟亦系尽优容之能事，一再延期审判。“大东亚圣战”的导演者--战犯东条，在监狱中居然得能饱食珍馐，阅览的画报都是由旧金山航寄来的。中国妇孺皆知的战犯土肥原，竟能在远东国际法庭格猖狂狡辩，将审讯战犯的法庭当作了宣传大和法西斯军国主义的讲坛。并且，若干已被列入战犯名单中的财阀如三井的池田、藤原，纺织业航业的巨子井田等等，均已从战犯名单中被剔出来了。
    麦克阿瑟除了在政治上支持日本反动的统治集团以外，在经济方面亦复竭力帮助着旧势力的复活。例如对纺织业的美国投资，美棉的供给，生丝出口的协助，将商船队交给私营公司，反对苏联代表修改日本劳工法的建议，否决工人生产管理权的要求，还有让日本渔船在中国领海捕鱼等等，无一不是表示他在为日本的财阀们打算。顷据芝加哥太阳报记者报导：“爱德华教授于访问日本的期间，曾草拟了一个计划，主张解散三井、三菱、住友、安田四大财阀，以及其他财阀的独占性工业，并防其在联合国占领工作结束之后再行抬头。麦克阿瑟于七月初向华盛顿提出一个报告，批评爱德华解散财阀的意见，反对在目前对财阀采取任何激烈之措施，因任何对付财阀之指令，将使吉田内阁处于困境。”（⑴⑵）
    目前日本土地集中的情形，依然如故，单拿天皇一个人来说，他就有熟田五万四千町，森林一百卅万町（一町合华亩十亩多）。土地改革是盟国接受日本无条件投降的最重要条款之一的民主化程序中不可缺少的一部份，而且没有土地改革，也就不可能很好的解决严重的粮食问题。盟国对日委员会于六月间讨论日本土地改革问题的时候，苏联代表建议要日本政府没收“不在地主”（即住在都市纵欲享乐的寄生地主）的土地。和建立土地基金，以便贷款给农民购置在乡地主的土地。规定地主拥有土地不得超过三町步，其余土地有代价的交给农民。这个公平合理的建议，竟被美代表艾契森认为是“侵犯神圣的私有财产权”（？）而被否决了。结果是通过了英代表的折衷方案--规定由国家收买佃耕的土地，并卖给农民。这个方案只不过是“画饼充饥”而已，以之实行土地改革，那是比骆驼穿过针眼还要难的。
    关于肃清日本法西斯军国主义思想的工作，麦克阿瑟也是阳奉阴违，他虽然也曾像煞有介事的下令废除神道教，但当苏联代表在盟国对日委员会上提议禁绝法西斯书籍（特别是希特勒的《我的奋斗》）的时候，美国占领当局便出来要保护日本反动分子的“思想与言论自由”了。美共领袖福斯特曾经说过：“麦克阿瑟是有法西斯倾向的反动分子”呵。
    对于日本的反动统治集团既然是如此的庇护、优容、支持、与助长，那么，对于要求民主的日本广大人民，也就必然而且事实上已经是加以恫吓、镇压、打击，与摧残，美国军队保卫着日皇皇宫及首相官邸，不让群众前去请愿；当群众作饥饿游行的时候，美军便予以威胁干涉，坦克骑兵一齐出动，卸去炮衣如临大敌。五月十八日东京二十五万人大示威以后的第三天，麦克阿瑟就发表一个反动的声明：“目无法纪分子（？）现在开始采用之有形威胁行为，不许其长此继续。如果日本社会少数分子（？）不再自制自重，我将不得不采必要步骤加以管制。”吉田内阁内务省于六月十八日颁布日皇命令说：“根据麦克阿瑟总部关于整顿不良组织的指令，凡一切未在相当政府机关登记的政治组织将被解散。”麦帅与天皇之相互利用，狼狈为奸，于此可见一斑。
    为什么在日寇偷袭珍珠港以后，美国对日“同仇敌忾”，势必“灭此朝食”，而当麦克阿瑟已然雄踞了樱花三岛的今天，却能“不念旧恶”对日本战犯以及整个的反动统治集团如此的“宽大”呢？这个问题的解答，是非常简单的。麦克阿瑟个人的倾向，并不能完全决定美国的对日政策，麦克阿瑟管制日本的一切措施，也就是美国反动的帝国主义集团之对日政策的具体表现。当前美国帝国主义集团的对日政策是什么呢？简单一句话就是：通过天皇控制日本，扶植一个买办性的政府、压制人民的民主运动，变日本为美国的附庸，并以之作为反苏的先锋与基地。据麦克阿瑟总部反间组组长索普准将的估计：“盟军占领时日得持续至二十年始能获得预期的收获。”其深谋远虑，是不难想见的。也只有明确地洞悉了美国帝国主义者这个战略的意图，麦克阿瑟对日管制的一切措施才能够得到解答。
    然而，主观的愿望，往往为发展着的客观事实所嘲弄与粉碎。在第一次大战以后，反动的英国统治者如张伯伦之流，坚持扶德抑法以反苏的反动政策，后来加上了一个达拉第，共同导演了一幕慕尼黑的悲剧，到头来是顿克尔刻的溃败，法国的沦亡，倘使没有英勇的苏联红军予希特勒匪徒以强有力的打击，则英伦三岛恐亦早已悬起“＠①”字旗了。不仅是反动的“绥靖主义”者们已自食其恶果，而且使欧洲乃至全世界无数千万的和平人民遭受了战争的浩劫！在“绥靖政策”之下，德国既可产生希特勒，在麦克阿瑟的对日政策之下，难道就不可能产生东条第二吗？这个苦痛的历史教训，美国当局是应当记取的。
    虽然日本法西斯帝国主义之必然溃灭是一个历史的宿命，但是，苏联出兵两天，它就宣布投降，并未尽最后一切努力以作“困兽之斗”而苟延时日，这其间原来是包含着一个巨大阴谋的。这个阴谋就是保留一点力量，准备乘机而再起。日本的反动势力在投降之初，确曾一度恐慌，因为不晓得在美国管制下将遭受到怎样的命运。后来看出了美国的用心，方才安定了下来，并且提高了自信。这一转变，近卫与有力焉。自币原以至吉田都是采取近卫的政治路线，就是一方面对麦克阿瑟“虚与委蛇”，故示恭顺，利用麦克阿瑟对他们的利用而利用麦克阿瑟；一方面“化整为零”，“陈仓暗渡”。这次的战争并没有打到日本本土，日本生产机构工业设备之破坏远不如报章杂志宣传渲染之甚。美国鲍莱最近赴日考察，据他统计日本纺织工业现在立刻可开工的可及战前的五分之一，一切其他工业设备可有战前四分之一的生产量，不到一年已恢复到如此程度，已属可观，更何况一定还有大量的资财、军火、与生产手段被隐藏起来了呢。至于日本法西斯军国主义力量之各种地下的阴谋活动，也是公开的秘密，在盟国对日委员会上，美方官员也不得不承认“有此事实”。在民主的伪装之下，许多“极端爱国主义”的政党与社团都相继成立起来了。最近吉田内阁内务大臣大村在议会中宣称：“政府预算中，有一千五百万元将用来扩充警察和改善警察的待遇。”大村承认目前警察数目大于占领军，但他仍主张非扩充警察组织不可。同时，在日本各地最近发现有若干学校实行强迫军训。日本法西斯军国主义之“卷土重来”的野心，是了如观火呵。
    压力大反抗力愈大。尽管麦克阿瑟与日本的反动统治集团协同地予日本民主运动以高压，然而，为民主与粮食而斗争的日本广大人民，在以日共为主干的民主阵线的领导之下，不屈不挠地战斗着自五月以来，一连串的游行示威，充分地显示了日本人民之民主力量的强大与生长。日本社会党所组织的职工团体--劳动总同盟，最近由于该党左翼领袖加藤勘十等参加领导，接受了日共建立职工统一战线的建议，扩大为全国性的组织，会员总数已增至八十五万五千人了。这不但是日本职工运动史上的一个新的里程碑，同时，也是目前日本民主运动之行将因此而愈益高涨的信号！今后日本民主与反民主的斗争必然会日趋尖锐，日本人民的斗争任务是非常复杂而艰巨的。但可确信，最后决定日本命运的将不是反动的麦克阿瑟、裕仁、币原、吉田之流，而是日本人民自己！
