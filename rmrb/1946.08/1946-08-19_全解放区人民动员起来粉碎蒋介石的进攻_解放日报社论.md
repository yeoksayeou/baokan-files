Liberation Daily Editorial

　　Encouraged by the erroneous policies of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek completely tore up the truce agreement, the Four Pledges, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the troop reorganization plan, and the Northeast truce agreement. After fighting fiercely in the Northeast, he extended the war to within the borders, repeatedly demanding the occupation of northern Jiangsu, the Jiaoji Railway, Jehol, and most of the Northeast. His troops have already occupied all of the Central Plains Liberated Area, most of the eastern Henan Liberated Area, a portion of the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Area, many towns along the Jiaoji Railway, and many places in southern Shanxi, central Hebei, eastern Hebei, Jehol, and the Northeast, and are launching large-scale offensives against various Liberated Areas. The troops that Chiang Kai-shek has deployed to attack the Liberated Areas account for 85 percent of his total military strength. From Xinjiang in the west to the East China Sea in the east, from Guangdong in the south to the Yangtze River in the north, Chiang Kai-shek has only left 15 percent of his troops in this vast region. Chiang Kai-shek's air force is entirely devoted to the civil war and has even bombed Yan'an. Judging from the deployment of troops, Chiang Kai-shek is using every last drop of his strength in a desperate gamble. No one can deny that the Chinese people have once again been plunged into a full-scale civil war by Chiang Kai-shek, on a scale unprecedented in decades. Precisely because this civil war is so large-scale and because Chiang Kai-shek continues to receive assistance from the reactionary faction in the United States, the Chinese people must not underestimate Chiang Kai-shek's offensive this time. We must unite, work hard, and crush this offensive!

　　When the truce order was issued on January 10th and the Political Consultative Conference closed on January 31st this year, we Communists believed that China had begun to enter a new stage of peace and democracy. Current events show that we members of the Chinese Communist Party were too eager for peace and democracy, overestimated the reliability of the U.S. government in adhering to the Moscow Three-Power Conference resolutions, and thus overestimated Chiang Kai-shek's promises. In order to salvage peace, even after Chiang Kai-shek had already begun to tear up his various promises, the CCP still made multiple concessions and put forward multiple peace proposals, but all were rejected by Chiang Kai-shek. Now the historical facts are very clear: the charter of peace and democracy has been fundamentally overturned by Chiang Kai-shek, the flames of all-out war have been ignited by Chiang Kai-shek, and the one who is helping Chiang Kai-shek equip, transport, and even cooperate in the fighting of his civil war troops is none other than the U.S. government, which loudly proclaims "mediation" and "aid to China." Therefore, all the hopes of the people of the country must be placed on the victory of the just self-defense war of the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas. The people of the whole country have learned from countless painful experiences that only if the people's self-defense war in the Liberated Areas is victorious can there be hope for peace and democracy in the whole country, can everyone have food to eat, can secret agents and corruption disappear, and can national independence be guaranteed. This truth remains true today, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, in order to protect the lives, property, rights, and happiness of the people in all Liberated Areas, in order to resolve the great disaster and crisis of the people of the country, and in order to restore peace and implement the solemn resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the military and civilians in all Liberated Areas today face their historical task: to mobilize all forces to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!

　　Why does Chiang Kai-shek dare to attack the Liberated Areas? This is because the reactionary faction in the United States has given him various kinds of military aid, which has made him dizzy and made him think that he has the "upper hand" militarily. Chiang Kai-shek and a small group of warmongering warlords and party hacks have uttered countless wild words, saying that they can eliminate the people's army in the Liberated Areas within a year, half a year, or even three months. But Chiang Kai-shek is wrong! He only knows that war is determined by weapons, but he does not know that war is even more importantly determined by the soldiers who wield the weapons and the people who support the soldiers. The soldiers and the people are the foundation of victory. Chiang Kai-shek only has one advantage militarily, which is the weapons supplied to him by the United States. In addition, all are weaknesses: First, Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers are weary of war, because this war is fought too unreasonably. Even if Chiang Kai-shek repeats the old tune he sang at Lushan on "August 13th" a thousand times, he cannot convince a Chinese soldier to give his life for him. This weakness alone is more than enough to offset his advantage. All his sophisticated weapons can be "laid down" by his soldiers. In the one month of war in the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, Chiang Kai-shek's side lost 10,000 people their weapons and lives, and 30,000 people preserved their lives, but laid down their weapons, including several divisions famous for their combat in the War of Resistance. Second, the people on Chiang Kai-shek's side are even more opposed to the war, to the extent that Chiang Kai-shek has to fight against his own unarmed people while waging war against the Liberated Areas. For example, the Xiaguan massacre and the Kunming assassination case are examples of this. The people who oppose the war include not only workers, peasants, students, and staff, but also landlords, capitalists, and senior officials. The number of people who really want to fight a civil war is very small. Third, even the people who demand war themselves have no confidence. A very important financier and administrator in the National Government once frankly admitted that the Kuomintang's "neither reconciliation nor war" will drag it down, and war will defeat it, although he still chooses the latter path. From Soong Tzu-wen and Hsu Kan to Marshall and Stuart, all admit that the Kuomintang's financial and economic situation is facing total collapse, and this is still the case with the relatively small scale of war in the past six months. If the war continues to be fought on a large scale, the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will be even more plundered to the point of having no place to bury themselves, the rural areas in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will be even more bankrupt, the industry will be even more destroyed, and the Kuomintang's financial and economic situation will be even more of a dead end. No matter how Chiang Kai-shek suppresses it, the war-weary and anti-war hearts and minds of the soldiers and people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will turn into a great fire that will burn Chiang Kai-shek's own fascist group! Therefore, various Chinese and foreign newspapers, including some newspapers that have always supported Chiang Kai-shek, have warned that continuing to fight will only give the Communist Party more advantages militarily and politically. Their observations are reasonable, because the situation in the Liberated Areas is exactly the opposite of that of Chiang Kai-shek: First, the Liberated Areas oppose war, but Chiang Kai-shek launched the war and forced the Liberated Areas to rise up in self-defense. The war is for the interests of the people, for the interests of the nation, it is just, indignant, sacred, and related to the life, death, safety, and well-being of the people of all Liberated Areas and the people of the country. Therefore, the warriors who give the reactionary faction a crushing blow in the self-defense war are supported and worshiped by the people of all Liberated Areas and the people of the country, just as they were in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Second, the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas are a close, free, and equal family. This family does not have the wealthy nobles, warlords, and secret agents that are unique to Chiang Kai-shek's side, so there will be no "collapse." Third, this family is not only firmly rooted, but it is also really big. It already includes one-third of the country's population, equal to the entire population of the United States. It has such a large area, such a large army and militia. If Chiang Kai-shek has not been able to fight out a result with it in the past ten years of civil war, it is even more impossible for him to fight out a result today. Chiang Kai-shek and his fascist oligarchic group, who are enemies of the people of the whole country, will not live long if they continue to be reactionary. The current Liberated Areas have rich experience to cope with any serious offensive. The army of the Liberated Areas sometimes temporarily withdraws from some land and some cities in order to easily eliminate the invading enemy's vital forces. This is inevitable and necessary, but it rarely loses its own vital forces. In fact, since the Southern Anhui Incident, the reactionary faction has not annihilated a single battalion or regiment of the Eighth Route Army or the New Fourth Army. On the contrary, Chiang Kai-shek's army, which is attacking the Liberated Areas, was, is, and will always be a constant source of replenishment of personnel and weapons for the army of the Liberated Areas. Since Chiang Kai-shek is determined not to have peace, let him choose war. Sooner or later, he will have to be convinced that history develops according to the demands of the people, not according to the demands of reactionary factions in China and abroad, and is not determined by foreign weapons.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's war plan must be crushed, and it will inevitably be crushed, but this does not mean that the victory of the people's self-defense war will come easily, and it does not mean that we should be arrogant and careless because of the victories we have already achieved. Because of the assistance of the United States, the reactionary faction still has certain, even temporary and one-sided, superior weapon conditions militarily. We must be vigilant and cautious. The safety of all Liberated Areas, the happiness and misfortune of the people of the country, and the future of the country and the nation are all on our shoulders. Any arrogance or carelessness is a serious crime. All the forces in all Liberated Areas must be fully mobilized to serve the self-defense war. All soldiers and people must fully understand the nature, situation, and future of the war; the regular army must correctly understand the guiding principles of the war, carefully organize each battle, ensure the victory of each battle, must earnestly examine and strengthen the political work of the troops, continue to improve the awareness and discipline of the cadres and soldiers of the troops, personal model of military-civilian relations, and timely eliminate any bad tendencies in the troops; guerrillas and militia should closely cooperate with the main force in combat, and learn from the example of the First Division of Jiangsu-Anhui, persist in guerrilla warfare in the areas where the main force has withdrawn, contain the reactionary faction's offensive, attack the reactionary faction's rear, and protect the interests of the people there, so that they will not be destroyed by the reactionary faction. The supply of the troops, the care of the wounded, and all other rear work and battlefield service work should be carried out jointly by the army, the government, and the people's organizations, so that the fighting troops can fight with peace of mind. The self-defense war is supported by the people. The people are willing to contribute their manpower and material resources to achieve victory, but the army and the government must still pay great attention to cherishing the people's strength, pay great attention to thrift, strictly prohibit extravagance and waste, so as to reduce the burden on the people as much as possible. In short, only by mobilizing all the military and civilians in all Liberated Areas and carrying out tense and arduous struggle can we crush the reactionary faction's offensive! Our struggle is just, our victory is what the people of the whole country rely on, we are supported by justice and will receive abundant assistance, Chiang Kai-shek is unpopular and will receive little assistance, our future is bright, and we will definitely win!

　　全解放区人民动员起来粉碎蒋介石的进攻
    解放日报社论
    由于蒋介石在美国错误政策鼓励之下，完全撕毁了停战协定、四项诺言、政协决议、整军方案、和东北停战协议，在东北大打之后，又把战火烧进关内，再三要求占领苏北、胶济线、热河、和东北绝大部分，他的军队已经侵占了中原解放区全部，豫东解放区大部，苏皖解放区的一部，胶济线许多城镇，晋南冀中冀东热河和东北的许多地方，并正在向各解放区大举进攻。蒋介石调来进攻各解放区的军队，已达其全部兵力百分之八十五。西至新疆，东至东海，南至广东，北至长江，这一个广大地区中，蒋介石只留下百分之十五的兵力。蒋介石的空军都用来进行内战，并轰炸了延安。从兵力的部署上看，蒋介石是用尽了最后一滴力量来孤注一掷。谁也不能否认，中国人民已被蒋介石再一次抛入全面内战，规模之大是数十年来所未有的。正因为此次内战规模巨大，而且蒋介石又有美国反动派继续援助，因此中国人民决不能轻视此次蒋介石的进攻，必须团结起来，努力奋斗，将这次进攻予以粉碎！
    在今年一月十日停战令发布，一月三十一日政协会闭幕的时候，我们共产党人曾经认为中国已经开始进入和平民主的新阶段。现在的事变，表明我们中共党人是太热望和平与民主，过高的估计了美国政府遵守莫斯科三国会议决议的可靠性，以至过高的相信了蒋介石的诺言。为了挽救和平，就在蒋介石已经开始撕毁他的各项诺言以后，中共仍然作了多次的忍让，提出了多次的和平建议，但是都受到了蒋介石的拒绝。现在历史的事实，已经非常清楚：和平与民主的宪章已经被蒋介石从根本上推翻了，全面战争的火焰已经被蒋介石点起了，而帮助蒋介石装备运输其内战军队甚至配合其作战的不是别人，恰恰就是高唱“调处”和“援华”的美国政府。因此全国人民的一切希望，就不得不寄托于解放区军民正义的自卫战争的胜利。全国人民已经从无数的惨痛经验中知道，只有解放区人民自卫战争胜利了，全国才有和平民主的希望，才能使人人有饭吃，特务和贪污才会敛迹，民族的独立才有保障。这一真理，在抗日战争胜利后的今天，依然是真理。因此，为了保卫全解放区人民的生命财产权利幸福，为了解救全国人民的大灾难大危机，为了恢复和平实行政协的庄严决议，全解放区军民今天面对着自己的历史任务：动员一切力量粉碎蒋介石的进攻！
    蒋介石为什么敢于进攻解放区？这是因为美国反动派给了他各种军事援助，使他冲昏头脑，以为他在军事上“占上风”了，蒋介石及其一小群内战狂的军阀党棍，曾经发出无数狂言，说在一年内、半年内、甚至三个月内，就可以消灭解放区的人民军队。但是蒋介石错了！他只知道战争决定于武器，而不知道战争更重要的是决定于拿武器的士兵和供养士兵的人民，兵民才是胜利之本。蒋介石在军事上仅仅有一个优点，就是美国供给他的武器。此外都是弱点：第一、蒋介石的兵心厌战，因为这个仗打得太没有道理，那怕蒋介石把“八一三”在庐山所讲的老调再讲一千遍，也不能说服一个中国士兵去为他舍命，仅仅这个弱点，就已经抵消了他的优点而有余。他的一切高妙的武器，都可以被他的士兵“放下”的。在苏皖边区一个月的战争中，蒋介石方面就有一万人丧失了武器和生命，有三万人保存了生命，但是放下了武器，其中包括在抗战中以作战著名的几个师。第二、蒋介石那边的民心尤其反战，以至蒋介石在向解放区作战的同时，不得不向自己所统治的徒手人民作战，例如下关惨案和昆明的暗杀案，就是如此。反战的人民不仅包括工人农民学生职员，而且包括地主资本家和高级官员。真正想打内战的人，数目很少。第三、甚至要求战争的人自己也没有信心，国民政府的一个很重要的财主兼行政官，曾经坦白承认国民党“不和不战”是拖垮，战是打垮，虽然他还是选择最后一条路。从宋子文、徐堪、到马歇尔、司徒雷登，都承认国民党的财政经济状况是面临着总崩溃，而这还是过去半年战争规模比较小的情形，战争继续大规模的打下去，国民党统治区的人民将更加被掠夺得死无葬身之地，国民党统治区的农村将更加破产，工业将更加毁灭，国民党的财政经济将更加是死路一条，不管蒋介石怎样镇压，那时国民党统治区厌战反战的兵心与民心，就会变成烧死蒋介石自己法西斯集团的一团大火！所以中外各报，包括素来拥护蒋介石的若干报纸，都警告说打下去只有使共产党在军事上政治上更得势。他们的观察是有理由的，因为解放区的情形恰恰和蒋介石相反：第一，解放区反对战争，但是蒋介石发起了战争，强迫解放区起而自卫战争是为了恢复和平和实现政协决议，这个自卫战争是为人民的利益，是为民族的利益，是正义的、悲愤的、神圣的，是与全解放区人民和全国人民的生死安危相关联的。因此，在自卫战争中给反动派以粉碎打击的勇士们，受到全解放区和全国人民的拥护顶礼膜拜，如同在抗日战争中一样。第二，解放区的军民是一个亲密的自由平等的大家庭，这个家庭没有蒋介石那边所特有的吸尽民脂民膏的豪富贵族军阀特务，因此也不会有“崩溃”。第三，这个家庭不但根基巩固，而且也着实是大了，它已经包括全国人口的三分之一，等于美国全国的人口，它有这样大的面积，这样大的军队和民兵，如果蒋介石过去经过十年内战也没有和它打出个结果，今天他想打出结果是更加不可能了。与全国人民为敌的蒋介石和他的法西斯寡头集团继续反动下去，是一定没有多久生命的。现在的解放区已经有了丰富的经验足以应付任何严重的进攻，解放区的军队为了便于消灭入侵敌人的有生力量，有时暂时的退出一些土地一些城市，这是不可免的，而且是必要的，但是却很少损失自己的有生力量。事实上从皖南事变以来，反动派就没有消灭过八路军、新四军一营一团，相反的，进攻解放区的蒋介石军队，过去是现在是将来也还是解放区军队的人员武器的经常补充来源。既然蒋介石坚决不愿意和平，那么就让他选择战争吧，迟早总要叫他信服：历史是按着人民的要求发展，而不是按着中外反动派的要求发展的，也不是决定于外国的武器。
    蒋介石战争计划必须被粉碎，也必然被粉碎，但是这决不是说人民自卫战争的胜利会容易的到来，这决不是说我们应当以已有的胜利而骄傲轻率。反动派因为美国的援助，在军事上既然还占有某种即使是暂时的和片面的比较优越的武器条件，我们就必须警惕戒慎，全解放区的安危、全国人民的祸福、国家民族前途的吉凶都担在我们的肩上，任何骄傲轻率都是严重的罪恶。全解放区的一切力量必须充分动员起来，服务于自卫战争，所有的战士和人民都必须充分了解战争的性质形势和前途；正规军必须正确了解战争的指导方针，细心的组织每一个战役，保证每一个战役的胜利，必须切实检查和加强部队的政治工作，继续提高部队干部和战士的觉悟性和纪律性，个人模范的军民关系，及时消灭部队中的任何不良倾向；游击队和民兵要密切配合主力作战，并学习苏皖一分区的榜样，在主力撤退的地区坚持游击战争，箝制反动派的进攻，打击反动派的后方，保护那里的人民利益，使不受反动派所摧残。部队的补给，伤兵的料理，以及其他一切后方工作和战地服务工作，应当由军队政府和人民团体共同努力，使战斗的部队得以安心作战。自卫战争是人民所拥护的，人民意愿贡献自己的人力物力来取得胜利，但是军队和政府仍然必须十分注意爱惜民力，十分注意节约，严禁铺张浪费，借以尽一切可能来减轻人民的负担。总之，只有全解放区军民一致动员，进行紧张的艰苦的奋斗，才能粉碎反动派的进攻！我们的奋斗是正义的，我们的胜利是全国人民所寄托的，我们是得道多助，蒋介石是失道寡助，我们的前途是光明的，我们一定要胜利！
