(A dispatch from Handan) The students of the Democratic Nation-Building School, sponsored by the Democratic Nation-Building Army, recently used all of their living allowance of over 19,000 yuan and a large quantity of daily necessities to comfort the wounded and sick soldiers and their families from the Central Plains Liberated Area who are recuperating here. In their letter of sympathy, they wrote: "When we heard that Chiang Kai-shek mobilized two to three hundred thousand troops with American weapons to 'encircle and annihilate' and 'pursue' the Central Plains troops who had contributed to the war effort, and attacked the people's autonomous Central Plains Liberated Area, every one of us students shed tears of indignation. You are glorious for bravely resisting the attacks of the reactionaries. We pledge to be your backup."
