　　Kuomintang Blocks Canal Dams Leading to the Yangtze River
    Canal Water Level Continuously Rises
    Our Party and Government Personnel Along the Dike Personally Lead the Masses to Intensify Defenses
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 15th] The Kuomintang authorities in Yangzhou continue to block the dams along the canal that lead to the Yangtze River, stubbornly refusing to open them, causing the canal water level to rise continuously due to the flooding of the Huai and Yi rivers, making it impossible to discharge the water. As of the 4th of this month, the water level in the southern section of the canal had risen to one zhang, four chi, and one cun, which is one cun higher than the level requiring defense, and there is concern that continuous heavy rains will cause it to rise further. Therefore, the Construction Department of the Suwan Border Government and the Southern Canal Project Office have been carrying out full-scale defense work since August 1st; the Second Special District Office has also issued "Emergency Dike Protection Measures"; and the Party committees and governments at all levels along the dike are personally leading the masses to defend with all their strength. In the Jieshou to Shaobo section alone, there are thirteen work sheds and felt sheds, staffed by three people with rich experience in canal engineering, cooperating with the Jiangdu-Gaoyou Dike Protection Brigade, patrolling and guarding day and night. The section south of Shaobo, because it is often harassed by Chiang's troops, is guarded by the New Fourth Army stationed in Shaobo. Furthermore, on the 30th of last month, more than 2,000 people in the Huhe district of Suqian-Zhuang county, seeing that the water level of the Yi River within their territory was high and almost level with the dike, rushed to reinforce the dike, digging more than a thousand cubic meters of soil overnight, until the river water stopped rising.

　　国民党堵塞运河归江各坝
    运河水势不断上涨       
    我沿堤党政人员亲率群众加紧设防
    【新华社淮阴十五日电】扬州国民党当局，仍继续阻塞运河归江各坝，坚不开启，致使运河水势因淮沂伏泛上涨不已，无法宣泄。截至本月四日，运河南段水位已涨达一丈四尺一寸，比应防设水位犹高出一寸，且连日大雨尚有续涨之虑。为此，苏皖边府建设厅、运河南段工程事务所，自八月一日起即进行全线设防；二专署并颁布“紧急护堤办法”；沿堤各级党委政府，均亲自领导群众全力防守。仅界首至邵伯一段，即设有十三个工防棚毡棚，由三名富有运河工程经验人员配合江（都）高（邮）护堤大队，不分昼夜巡逻守卫。邵伯以南一段，因常受蒋军袭扰，由驻邵伯新四军担任护卫。又上月三十日，宿（迁）壮县护河区群众二千余，以境内沂水水位高涨，几与河堤相平，抢着增修河堤，一夜间扒土千余方，直至河水停涨。
