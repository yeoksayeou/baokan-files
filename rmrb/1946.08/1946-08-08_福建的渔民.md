Title: Fishermen of Fujian

　　The coast of Fujian, stretching over 1,800 li, is one of China's most important fishing grounds, supporting the livelihoods of no fewer than one million people. Before the war, annual production exceeded one million piculs, valued at seven million yuan. However, they never received assistance from the Kuomintang government. During the war, they suffered planned destruction by the Japanese invaders. The four major fishing areas of Anxi, Lianjiang, Dongshan, and Pingtan are currently in the fishing season, but the 210,000 fishermen directly engaged in fishing and the 800,000 people involved in fish curing and equipment are living extremely difficult lives under the "official harassment" of pirates, puppet troops, and the Kuomintang's harsh government.

　　The pirates and puppet troops turned into pirates, scattered soldiers, and vagrants are a major disaster for the fishermen. From November of last year to March of this year, fishermen hardly went a day without encountering pirates. There was even a week when 23 robbery cases occurred. Kunshan in Zhenpu Road and Dongyong in Lianjiang County are havens for bandits.

　　The Kuomintang's military police treat fishermen as ignorant people, demanding "dry goods" and "grease money" from them in the name of inspection. There was a time when the journey of less than 100 li from the mouth of the Min River to the Taijiang district required passing through 18 "inspections."

　　Another form of "official harassment" is tax on tax (or fee), which has become a disguised form of customs duty. In late June, fishing boats passing through Qianjiang were detained because of a handling fee, which involved fish worth ten million yuan. The handling fee is a blessing bestowed on the fishermen by the Kuomintang's loyal organ—the Senate. It is said to be used as a "national education fund."

　　There is a "fish broker" between the fishermen and the market. Fujian's "fish brokers" come in two types: market "fish brokers" and island "fish brokers." Market "fish brokers" are fishing brokers, while island "fish brokers" are even more unreasonable exploiters, relying on a scale to extract an additional 10%. Now, they are using the beautiful name of cooperatives to carry out this exploitation, and fishermen cannot escape this circle of exploitation whether they enter the market or trade in the district.

　　Under these layers of extraction, fishermen have no way to develop. In the past, they had 10,800 fishing boats, but now they only have 6,000, and all of them are small. As for the larger "diao boats," they have now disappeared.

### 福建的渔民

　　福建的渔民
    长约一千八百余里的福建沿海为我国重要渔场之一，依之为生者不下百万人。战前每年生产在一百万市担以上，获值七百万元，但从来没有得到国民党政府的帮助。战时又遭受日寇有计划的破坏。安×、连江、东山、平潭四大渔区正是渔汛期，但直接捕鱼的二十一万渔民和从事腌制渔具的八十万人，却在海盗、伪军、国民党苛政的“官扰”之下，度着极艰难的日子。
    原来的海盗、伪军变成的海盗、散兵、游勇是渔民的大灾星。自去年十一月至今年三月，渔民几乎没有一天不遇到海盗的光顾，曾经有一个星期发生了二十三件劫案。阵浦路的昆山与连江县的东勇，更是匪盗之汇。
    国民党的军警把渔民看作愚民，以检查之名向渔民要“干子”“油水”。曾有一个时期，自闽江口至台江区，这未及百里的归程竟要经过十八次“检查”。
    另一种“官扰”是税上加税（或费），成为变相的关卡厘金。六月下旬，渔船路过前江，曾发生因手续费而要扣押价值千万元的渔货的事。手续费乃是国民党御用机关——参议会所通过的对渔民的恩赐。据说作为“国教基金”。
    渔民与市场之间有一种“鱼牙”。福建的“鱼牙”，有市场“鱼牙”与岛屿“鱼牙”两种。市场“鱼牙”是渔的掮客，而岛屿“鱼牙”则是更无理的剥削者，他们凭一根秤加一成的抽用。现在更用了合作社的美名干这压榨的勾当，渔民进市场或在区成交都逃不出这一剥削圈子。
    在这层层的榨取下，渔民没有办法发展，过去他们有一万八百艘渔船，现在只剩了六千艘，而且都是小型的。至于较大型的“吊船”现在绝迹了。
