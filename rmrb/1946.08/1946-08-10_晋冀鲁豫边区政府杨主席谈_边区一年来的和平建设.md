Chairman Yang of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government Discusses Peaceful Construction in the Border Region Over the Past Year

The anniversary of the Japanese surrender is approaching. The reporter interviewed Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government about the peaceful construction of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region in the past year. Chairman Yang responded as follows:

On August 8th of last year, we launched a counteroffensive in coordination with the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan. During this period, due to the Red Army's invincibility and the active operations of our Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, and South China Column and other anti-Japanese forces, the Japanese fascists were forced to announce their unconditional surrender on the 10th. Thereupon, the people of the entire border region immediately took action, cooperating with their sons and brothers in the Eighth Route Army to launch a larger-scale counteroffensive. Able-bodied men directly participated in carrying the wounded, transporting ammunition, and transporting military grain, while the elderly, women, and children maintained law and order in the rear and completed various production and construction tasks. Therefore, we were able to quickly complete the counteroffensive, connecting the four regions of Taihang, Taiyue, Jinnan, and Ji-Lu-Yu into one, increasing the original eighty-two county towns to one hundred and fourteen, with a total of one hundred and seventy-five counties including those without county towns but with county-level political power.

Simultaneous with the start of the counteroffensive, peaceful construction began throughout the border region. Since the ceasefire order came into effect on January 13th, the border region has further carried out peaceful construction with all its strength in a planned and step-by-step manner.

First, on democratic reform, we continued the work during the War of Resistance. After the people's emancipation movement, over 90% of the village administrations in the old liberated areas had undergone general elections, and the village administrations in the newly liberated areas had also been largely transformed. After eight years of training and transformation during the War of Resistance, the democratic political power in the border region, from villages to districts to counties, has become very sound and powerful. After a year of peaceful construction, the political power at all levels has become more sound and stronger.

In this year, the people of the entire border region have conducted universal representative elections for National Assembly representatives. Farmers, workers, merchants, students, soldiers, and women have all elected their own representatives to participate in the election, electing a total of fifty National Assembly representatives. If the Kuomintang completely implements the Three Major Agreements without modification, we are prepared to participate in the National Assembly.

In order to thoroughly implement the Three Major Agreements, our border region convened the largest-scale参议会 (Consultative Assembly) in March, with over 470参议员 (Consultative Assembly members) attending. These参议员 (Consultative Assembly members) had all undergone general elections before the meeting. At this参议会 (Consultative Assembly), peaceful construction plans for the entire border region, including 整军复员 (military reorganization and demobilization), finance, economy, education, and mobilizing the people to consolidate peace, were passed. After the meeting, they were gradually implemented. The 整军复员 (military reorganization and demobilization) has reached 70,500 people.

The support of the people's self-initiated emancipation movement has made the greatest progress since peaceful construction. Almost two-thirds of the cadres of political organs participated in supporting the people's 反奸清算 (anti-traitor liquidation) and rent and interest reduction work. In the old liberated areas, over 90% of the rent reduction work has been completed, and 60% to 70% of this work has been carried out in the newly liberated areas. On average, farmers throughout the border region have received almost two to three acres of land, and in most areas of our border region, the elimination of extreme poverty has been achieved, gradually realizing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition of "land to the tillers."

Another important task in peaceful construction is disaster relief. Aside from the Yellow River diversion relief, which is national in scope, relief for the disaster caused by the enemy and puppets in Mafang, Qin County, water disasters in Daming and other places, and relief funds for recovered towns and mines have amounted to 9 million catties of millet and 50,000,000冀钞 (Ji banknotes) to date. In order to solve the diseases of the people in the entire border region, the Border Government has established five large-scale peace hospitals in Xingtai, Linqing, Puyang, Changzhi, and Handan to carry out extensive medical work.

However, because our border region has suffered severely from the devastation of the enemy and puppets for eight years, the loss of manpower, material resources, and financial resources is extremely heavy (our Border Region Government Relief Association has reported detailed statistical materials on various specific losses to the Executive Headquarters), and relief is urgently needed at present. However, we have received very few relief materials from the Executive Headquarters in the past. A batch sent by the Executive Headquarters from Taiyuan was not only seized by Yan Xishan's troops under the command of puppet army Duan Bingchang in Qin County, but also resulted in the killing of many old people in Qin County and the arrest of more than 600 people. Recently, Jiang Tingfu of the Executive Headquarters even said, "The liberated areas do not need grain relief," which is completely unreasonable denial. We want to make a solemn appeal to the whole country and the world.

Secondly, on production and construction: (1) Agricultural production: Although after the counteroffensive began last year, we were faced with serious difficulties created by the enemy and puppets, our entire border region still carried out the vigorous wheat planting movement and various productions in a more orderly and planned manner than in any previous year. According to the investigation, the autumn wheat planting last year in Ji-Lu-Yu and Jinnan generally accounted for 70% to 80% of the total land. Some reached 90%. Because of the cold weather in Taihang and Taiyue, many areas also planted 70%, and generally planted 30% to 50%.

Over the past year, 70% to 90% of the total labor force in the old liberated areas of the border region have participated in mutual aid groups and cooperatives. In the newly liberated areas where the people's emancipation movement has been more thorough, such as Changzhi, Changzi, and Jincheng, the participation rate in mutual aid groups and cooperatives has also reached 50% to 70%.

In this year's agricultural production, the entire border region has made efforts to 多耕多锄 (plow and hoe more), 精耕细作 (cultivate intensively). In some areas of Taihang and Taiyue, 耕三余一 (plowing three times and leaving one) has been achieved. Taking the meticulous cotton planting as an example, the Taihang region, which was not accustomed to planting cotton in the past, planned to plant one million mu this spring, but planted 1.5 million mu. This year, the entire Taiyue region also planted over 700,000 mu of cotton. Ji-Lu-Yu, especially Jinnan, has an even larger number. According to preliminary statistics, the cotton planting area in the entire border region has reached over 8 million mu.

(2) Industry and Mining: After the end of the War of Resistance, due to the puppet and stubborn elements inheriting the enemy's blockade policy and continuing to implement a blockade against our border region, the Border Government led the people to be self-sufficient and further developed self-reliant handicrafts in the entire border region. Woolen textiles, cloth, papermaking, oil pressing, etc., have not only reached self-sufficiency, but also have some exports. According to the investigation, only 土布 (homespun cloth) has 50 million catties for export each year, and there is also a large amount of oil for export. Other industries such as leather, flour, and matches are also gradually recovering.

All the large mines and factories before the War of Resistance were fully restored shortly after the counteroffensive. Small coal mines, iron industries, and porcelain industries have also largely resumed operation.

Because of inconvenient transportation, small factories and mines have developed very commonly in various places. Moreover, small factories and mines make the most money.

Due to the development of industry and mining and the prosperity of commerce, two large-scale transportation companies have been formed.

The lives of workers have also been improved. The highest wage is equivalent to 400 catties of millet per month, and the lowest is 200 catties per month, which is a great improvement compared to the life before the War of Resistance.

(3) Commerce: Since the beginning of the counteroffensive and the recovery of towns, we have proposed "developing the economy and prospering the market" according to the inland trade freedom policy. Therefore, every town has prospered immediately after being recovered. Over the past year, every market in the border region has been greatly developed. Taking Handan City as an example, according to the recent talk of the 商联筹委会 (Commercial Federation Preparatory Committee): the number of seated merchants and stall vendors in the city has increased to 2,500 to 2,600 (of which small stall vendors account for slightly less than half). The import and export tax rates are also not high. In the past six months, although market prices have fluctuated twice due to misjudgment of peace and poor management of import and export goods, the prices in various markets have fallen back and gradually stabilized after emergency measures.

(4) Transportation Construction: In order to facilitate the exchange of goods and economic information in various places, the border region started to restore transportation since the beginning of the counteroffensive. Over the past year, not only have the roads within the entire border region been restored, but the roads leading to neighboring areas such as Linyi, Kaifeng, Anyang, and Shijiazhuang have also been repaired. In order to rationally manage these roads, a Highway Administration Bureau has been established. We have also started planning railways. Since the end of February, we have established a Railway Administration Bureau to carry out restoration preparations. Not only have various railway projects been surveyed and measured long ago, and several sections of the roadbed have been completed, but because the Kuomintang has no sincerity in restoring transportation and wants to use it as a means to attack the border region, the railway has not been fully completed so far.

Another important task in transportation construction is the universal adjustment and expansion of post offices and postal routes. Over the past year, the postal routes in the entire border region have become more rationalized, and the delivery time has been greatly shortened. Recently, the border region has also negotiated with the Kuomintang authorities through Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party of China, to prepare to open up with the national postal service.

(5) Water Conservancy Construction: Ji-Lu-Yu launched a large-scale Yellow River management project on an unprecedented scale, with 230,000 civilian laborers regularly engaged in levee restoration work along the 400-mile-long Yellow River. We are preparing to complete the Yellow River management project that has not been completed for decades. In Jinnan, the river management project this year has also achieved significant results.

In order to ensure this year's production and construction, 150 million yuan of production loans have been announced from January to July in the first half of the year, and 50 million yuan has been issued but not announced, totaling 200 million yuan.

Third, education construction can be divided into social education and school cadre education.

In school cadre education, the border region has established Northern University in the past year, with Mr. Fan Wenlan, a famous professor and scholar from Beiping before the War of Resistance, as the president. There are now more than 1,500 staff and students. The number of secondary schools in the entire border region has increased from more than 20 during the War of Resistance to 47. The number of students has also more than doubled.

During the War of Resistance, there were more than 60 高小校 (higher primary schools) with 8,760 students in Taihang, and now there are 134 with the number of students increasing to 13,400; during the War of Resistance, there were 129 in Jinnan with more than 20,000 students, and now there are 164 with 32,800 students; during the War of Resistance, there were 82 in Ji-Lu-Yu with 26,000 students, and now there are 160 with 39,000 students; during the War of Resistance, there were 80 in Taiyue, and now there are 138 with 13,277 students.

The number of 初小校 (junior primary schools) in the entire border region: there were 4,680 in Taihang before the counteroffensive, and now there are 6,201; the number of students is only a partial statistic of 122,579; there were 4,185 in Jinnan before the counteroffensive, and now there are 9,099 with 6,100,000 students; there were 5,887 in Ji-Lu-Yu before the counteroffensive, and now there are 23,000 with 1,250,000 students; there were 300 in Taiyue before the counteroffensive, and now there are 5,120 with 230,000 students.

Among them, there are 15,000 public-funded students in the universities, middle schools, 高小校 (higher primary schools), and 初小校 (junior primary schools).

In many counties in the border region, the number of enrolled children accounts for more than 80% of school-age children. According to the survey in Zuoquan: there are 11,993 school-age children, and 10,111 children are enrolled. The national education in the entire border region is moving in the direction of 民办公助 (people-run schools with government assistance). Taihang has increased from one-third before the counteroffensive to the current one-half.

Whether in universities, middle schools, 高小校 (higher primary schools), or 初小校 (junior primary schools), the new democratic education is implemented to inspire students' free thinking. From educational practice, it has been explored that running schools must be combined with practice and serve the people and production. Therefore, schools throughout the border region call on students to participate in practical work whenever there is an opportunity. For example, during the production season, they take production leave to help the people produce, and participate in helping the masses in the people's rent and interest reduction movement. From this learning combined with practice, they cultivate talents who serve the people.

Social education: On average, every administrative village in the entire border region has one to one and a half people's schools, and some administrative villages have two or three. According to statistics from 40 counties in Taihang, there are 15,000 people's schools with 1,050,000 male and female students. Almost all the masses of men and women in the entire border region have generally entered schools. In the people's schools, three kinds of education are carried out: current affairs, production, and literacy. After studying in the people's schools, the people's political and cultural level has been greatly improved, and the enthusiasm for production has also been developed. Any ordinary people can correctly discuss current affairs issues, and the people's thinking has been completely liberated. And some areas have achieved the elimination of illiteracy.

In addition to this, in social education, every village in the entire border region has a public blackboard, and many towns have public education centers and public broadcasting stations. Every town and many villages also have rural theater troupes; according to statistics from ten counties in Taihang, there are 998 rural theater troupes. No matter which village you walk into, you will feel an atmosphere of peace, tension, and joy.

Fourth, financial construction: First, after the realization of peace, we started to reduce the people's burden by 350 million yuan and implemented the method of calculating the price of supporting labor, which greatly reduced the people's labor force.

On rural burdens, a unified progressive tax and fair burden are implemented, and an industrial and commercial business tax is implemented in cities. Necessary industries are rewarded with tax exemption or reduction, and industry is reduced by one-quarter to one-third compared to commerce. More than 120 kinds of extortionate taxes and levies before the War of Resistance and during the enemy's rule have been completely abolished.

At the same time, the military, government, and civilian personnel of the entire border region have practiced frugality and used their own hands to produce themselves to make up for the shortage of funds and living expenses for organs and troops.

The entire border region has implemented free remittance, and people can freely remit their money.

In short, in the entire financial and economic construction, we not only focus on developing new sources of income, but also pay attention to节流 (reducing expenditure) in order to quickly restore the people's vitality.

Fifth, judicial work: In this year, the entire border region summarized and improved the experience of judicial work in the past eight years of the War of Resistance. For civil cases, the emphasis is on mediation. In this year, 80% of civil cases were resolved through mediation.

For criminal cases, the policy of education is adopted, and the perpetrators are required to focus on confession and self-reflection.

In litigation procedures, oral statements are mostly adopted to reduce troublesome procedures such as writing petitions.

Since ancient times, the laws of reactionary forces have been shackles to suppress the common people. And today, the laws of the democratic government are powerful weapons for the common people to suppress reactionary forces, maintain social order, and protect the people's production. Therefore, the current social order in the border region has reached an extraordinarily good state.

The above is only an overview of the peaceful construction in the border region in the past year. Many more specific and rich materials are still to be investigated and statistically analyzed. In a word, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region has been carrying out universal peaceful construction at all times since the Japanese surrender. After this year's efforts, the strength of the people in the border region has been many times greater than when they defeated the Japanese invaders. More than 30 million people in the entire border region have deeply realized their responsibility to defend peace, making the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region a strong fortress for defending the cause of independent, peaceful, and democratic construction. It is simply impossible for the reactionaries to divide us like the Japanese invaders.

From this year's peaceful construction, a general experience of the past few years has been further proved, that is, first of all, a united three-thirds democratic government should be established from top to bottom to lead the people, so that politics can serve the people at all times and in all matters, and first of all, politically, the people should be thoroughly liberated, allowing the people to fully enjoy their freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and residence, and carrying out 反奸清算 (anti-traitor liquidation) and thoroughly implementing rent and interest reduction, so that the traitors can be eliminated and the feudal reactionary rule can be overthrown, and then the improvement of the people's lives can be achieved satisfactorily.

In the current situation, the direction of future efforts should be to mobilize all forces to defend peace, defend the border region, repel the attacks of the Kuomintang fascist reactionaries, and implement the 反奸清算 (anti-traitor liquidation) and rent and interest reduction policies, thoroughly mobilize the masses, and then launch a large-scale production movement. Around this central task, the various peaceful constructions in the border region should be carried out even better. (Rong Yinong)

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府杨主席谈
    边区一年来的和平建设
    日寇投降周年已届，记者以晋冀鲁豫边区一年来和平建设的情形，叩访边府杨主席。承杨主席答复如下：
    去年八月八日，我们配合着苏联对日寇的宣战，开始了反攻。这期间，由于红军之不可敌御，以及我八路军、新四军、华南纵队等抗日部队的积极行动，迫使日本法西斯在十日宣布了无条件投降。于此，全边区人民立刻行动起来，配合子弟兵八路军进入更大规模的反攻。壮年人直接参加抬伤兵、运子弹、运军粮，老年和妇女儿童在后方维持治安，并完成各种生产建设任务。因此，我们能很快的完成反攻，使太行、太岳、冀南、冀鲁豫四个地区连成一片，使原来八十二座县城，增加到一百一十四座，连没有县城而有县政权的共达一百七十五县。
    与反攻开始同时，全边区就开始了和平建设。自停战命令于一月十三日生效后，边区更以全力有计划有步骤的进一步和平建设。
    首先在民主改革上，继续抗战中的工作。经过人民翻身运动，在老解放区的村政权已有百分之九十以上经过了普选，新解放区的村政权，也都大部经过改造。县政权经过普选的已有二十四县。边区的民主政权经过抗战八年的锻炼改造，自村而区而县已经很健全而有力了，经过一年来的和平建设，各级政权益加健全和坚强了。
    在这一年中，全边区人民已进行了普遍的代议性的国大代表选举，农、工、商、学、兵及妇女都推选了自己的代表参加选举，一共选出国大代表五十人。如果国民党毫无修改的彻底执行三大协议，我们是准备参加国民大会的。
    我们边区为了彻底执行三大协议，于三月间，召开了最大规模的一次参议会，到会参议员四百七十余人。这些参议员，在会前都经过了普选。在这次参议会上，通过了全边区的整军复员、财政、经济、教育、发动人民巩固和平等和平建设计划。会后均逐步付诸实施。整军复员已达七万零五百人。
    扶植人民自下而上的翻身运动，和平建设以来进步最大。政权机关几乎以三分之二的干部参加了扶持人民反奸清算、减租减息工作。在老解放区已有百分之九十以上完成了减租工作，新解放区也有百分之六十到七十进行了这一工作。全边区的农民平均差不多得到二三亩土地，在我们边区大部地区已经作到消灭赤贫，逐渐实现孙中山先生“耕者有其田”的主张。
    在和平建设中，另一个重要工作——就是救济灾荒。黄河改道救济因带有全国性的除外，仅救济沁县马坊等地敌伪灾，大名等地的水灾及收复各城镇矿山等救济费，截至目前统计，已用小米九百万斤，冀钞五万万元。为了解决全边区人民的疾病，边府在邢台、临清、濮阳、长治、邯郸等地设立了五个大规模的和平医院，开展广泛的医疗工作。
    但是由于我们边区八年来受敌伪的摧残，人力、物力、财力损失奇重（我们边区政府救济分会已将各种具体损失统计材料报告行总），目前急需救济。可是我们过去接到行总的救济物资很少。行总从太原发来的一批，不仅为阎锡山部指使伪军段炳昌部在沁县扣去，而且因此事杀死沁县武乡很多老百姓，并捕去六百多人。近来行总蒋廷黻竟说：“解放区不需要粮食救济”，这完全是无理的抵赖。我们要向全国与全世界提出郑重声诉。
    其次在生产建设上：（一）农业生产：去年反攻开始后虽然在敌伪造成的严重困难下，我们全边区仍然是较过去任何一年更有秩序有计划的进行了蓬蓬勃勃的种麦运动和各种生产。据调查去年秋季种麦，冀鲁豫、冀南一般占全土地的百分之七十到八十。有的达到百分之九十。太行太岳因为天气寒冷，很多地区也种到百分之七十，一般都种到百分之三十到五十。
    一年来，边区老解放区参加互助组与合作社的占全劳力的百分之七十到九十。而新解放区人民翻身运动较彻底的地区，如长治、长子、晋城等地，参加互助组合作社的亦达百分之五十到七十。
    在这一年的农业生产中，全边区都作到多耕多锄，精耕细作。在太行、太岳某些地区已作到耕三余一。就以耕作细致的种棉来说，过去种棉不习惯的太行全区，今春计划种一百万亩，结果种到一百五十万亩。太岳全区今年也种棉七十余万亩。冀鲁豫特别是冀南为数更大。据初步材料统计，全边区种棉业达八百余万亩。
    （二）工矿业：抗战结束后，由于伪顽承继了敌寇的封锁政策，继续对我边区实行封锁，边府领导人民自给自足，在全边区进一步普遍的展开了自力更生的手工业。毛织品、布匹、造纸、榨油等，不仅达到了可以自给自足，而且还有一部分可以出口。据调查仅土布每年有五千万斤可以出口，油类也有很大数量出口，其他皮革、面粉、火柴诸业亦逐渐恢复。
    抗战前的大矿厂均于反攻后不久全部恢复。小煤窑、铁业、磁业等均大部复业。
    因为交通不方便，所以各地小型工厂、矿厂发展的很普遍。而且也以小型工厂、矿厂赚钱最多。
    由于工业、矿业的发展，商业的繁荣，已有两个大规模的运输公司组成。
    工人生活也得到改善，工资最高者每月合小米四百斤，最低者每月也有二百斤，较抗战前的生活是大大的改善了。
    （三）商业：自反攻开始，城镇收复，我们根据内地贸易自由政策，提出“发展经济，繁荣市场”，所以各个城镇一收复，马上就繁荣起来。一年来，边区每一个市场都得到很大的发展，就以邯郸市来说，据商联筹委会最近谈：现在全市坐商与摊贩已增加到二千五六百座（其中小摊贩占二分之一弱）。出入口税率也不高。近半年来，虽然由于对和平估计有错，对出入口货管理较差，市场物价有两度波动，但近经紧急措施，各市场物价均已回落，逐渐走向平稳。
    （四）交通建设：为了便利各地商品的交流和经济情报的交换，边区自反攻开始，就着手恢复交通。一年来不仅全边区内的公路都已恢复，且已把通邻区临沂、开封、安阳、石家庄等公路均已修复。为了合理管理这些公路，并成立了公路管理局。铁路我们也着手筹划，自二月底起，我们就成立了铁路管理局，进行修复筹备工作。不仅铁路上各种工程早已勘察测量完竣，路基已有几段修成，只因国民党对修复交通毫无诚意，且欲以为进攻边区之手段，致使铁路迄今没有全部修成。
    在交通建设上另一个重要工作就是邮政局、邮路的普遍调整扩充。一年来全边区邮路更加合理化，邮递时间大大缩短。最近边区又通过中共代表周恩来将军与国民党当局交涉，准备与全国邮政打通。
    （五）水利建设：冀鲁豫以空前巨大的规模展开了治黄河工程，经常有二十三万民力，在四百多里长的黄河沿岸从事复堤工作。准备完成数十年来没有完成的治黄工程。而在冀南这一年的治河工程亦有显著成绩。
    为了保证今年的生产建设，上半年一月到七月发放生产贷款已宣布的有十五万万元，已发放尚未宣布的五万万元，共计二十万万元。
    第三、教育建设，可分社会教育和学校干部教育两方面。
    在学校干部教育上，一年来，边区创立了北方大学，由抗战前北平名教授、学者范文澜先生任校长，现在职员学生已达一千五百余人。中学教育全边区由抗战中已有的二十几处增加到四十七处。学生亦较前增加一倍以上。
    高小学校在抗战期间太行是六○余处，学生八七六○人，现在是一三四处，学生增加到一三、四○○人；冀南抗战期间一二九处，学生二○、○○○余人，现在一六四处，学生三二、八○○人；冀鲁豫抗战期间八二处，学生二六、○○○人，现在是一六○处，学生三九、○○○人；太岳抗战期间八十处，现有一三八处，现有学生已达一三、二七七人。
    全边区的初小校：太行在反攻前是四六八○处，现在是六、二○一处；学生仅一小部分统计是一二二、五七九人；冀南反攻前四、一八五处，现在九、○九九处，学生六一○、○○○万；冀鲁豫反攻前五、八八七处，现在是二三、○○○处，学生一、二五○、○○○人；太岳初小反攻前三○○处，现有五、一二○处，学生已达二三○、○○○人。
    其中干属在大学、中学、高小校、初小校的公费生有一五、○○○人。
    在边区内，很多县份入学儿童占到学龄儿童的百分之八十以上，如左权的调查：学龄儿童一一、九九三人，入学儿童即达一○、一一一人。全边区的国民教育正走向民办公助的方向，太行已由反攻前的三分之一，达到现在的二分之一。
    不论在大学、中学、高小、初小，都施行的是新民主主义的教育，启发学生的自由思想。从教育实践中摸索到办学校必须与实际结合，为人民为生产服务。因此全边区的学校，一有机会，就叫学生参加实际工作。例如在生产季节，放生产假帮助人民生产，在人民减租减息运动中，参加帮助群众翻身工作。从这种与实际结合的学习中，培养为人民服务的人材。
    社会教育方面：全边区平均每一个行政村都有一个到一个半民众学校，有的行政村有两三个。据太行四十个县的统计，共有民众学校一五、○○○处，男女学生一百零五万人。全边区男女群众几乎都已普遍入校。在民众学校里进行时事、生产、识字三种教育。人民经过在民众学校里学习，政治文化水准大大提高后，生产情绪也发扬起来。任何一个老百姓都可以正确谈论时事问题，人民的思想已获得彻底解放。并有部分地区，已作到消灭文盲。
    除此而外，在社会教育上，全边区村村有大众黑板，很多城镇都有民教馆、大众广播台。每个城镇和很多乡村还有农村剧团；据太行十个县的统计就有农村剧团九九八个。不管走进那个乡村，你都会感到一种和平、紧张、愉快的空气。
    第四、财政建设：首先在和平实现后，着手减轻人民负担三十五万万元，实行了支差计价办法，减轻了民力很多。
    在农村负担上，实行统一累进税与公平负担，在城市又实行了工商营业税。奖励必需的工业免税或减税，工业比商业减轻四分之一到三分之一。彻底废除了抗战前与敌寇统治时期的苛捐杂税一百二十多种。
    同时，全边区的军政民学工作人员实行了节衣缩食，从亲自动手自己生产，来弥补机关部队经费及生活费用之不足。
    全边区已实行自由通汇，人民可以自由汇兑自己的金钱。
    总之我们在整个财政经济建设上，不仅要着手开源，而且还注意节流，以迅速恢复人民的元气。
    第五、司法工作：在这一年间，全边区总结和提高了过去抗战八年中司法工作的经验，对民事案件，着重于调解。这一年中，百分之八十的民事案件，是以调解方式解决的。
    对刑事案件，则采取以教育为主，令犯罪者着重坦白自省。
    在诉讼手续上，多采取口诉方式，减少写状子等麻烦手续。
    自古以来，反动势力的法律都是压制老百姓的锁镣。而今天民主政府的法律则是老百姓用以镇压反动势力，维持社会治安，保护人民生产的有力武器。因之目前边区的社会秩序已达到异常良好的境地。
    以上这只是边区一年来和平建设的一个概况。许多更具体丰富的材料，尚待调查统计。总之一句话，晋冀鲁豫边区自日本投降以来，时时刻刻都在进行着普遍的和平建设。经过这一年的努力，边区人民的力量已较战胜日寇时，壮大了许多倍。全边区三千多万人民已深刻认识到自己保卫和平的责任，使晋冀鲁豫边区成了保卫独立和平民主建设事业的一个坚强堡垒，反动派要再像日寇一样的来分割我们，简直是不可能的。
    从这一年的和平建设中，更证明了几年来一个总的经验，这就是自上而下的首先成立一个联合的三三制的民主政府，领导人民，使政治时时刻刻、随事随地为人民服务，首先政治上使人民彻底解放，叫人民充分享受自己的言论、出版、集会、居住等自由，展开反奸清算，彻底实行减租减息，才能把汉奸肃清，把封建反动统治推翻，然后始能达到圆满的改善人民生活。
    在目前形势下，今后努力的方向，应该是动员一切力量保卫和平，保卫边区，打退国民党法西斯反动派的进攻，并贯彻反奸清算减租减息政策，彻底发动群众，进而展开大生产运动。围绕着这一中心任务，把边区各种和平建设开展的更好。（荣一农）
