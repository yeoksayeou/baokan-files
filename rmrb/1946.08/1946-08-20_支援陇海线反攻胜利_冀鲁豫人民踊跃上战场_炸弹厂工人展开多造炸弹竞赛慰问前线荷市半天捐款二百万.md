　　Supporting the Victory of the Counter-offensive on the Longhai Line
    People of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Actively Join the Battlefield
    Workers in Bomb Factories Launch a Competition to Produce More Bombs to Comfort the Front Lines; Heze City Donates Two Million in Half a Day
    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 14th Dispatch] The people along the Longhai Line are extremely angry at the large-scale civil war launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Masses, militia, and honorary soldiers from counties such as Peixian, Jinxiang, Yutai, Peitong, and Fengle have successively gone to the front lines to defend themselves with arms. Shao Miao, the director of the peasant association and village head of Jinxiang, said indignantly at a village cadre meeting: "If Chiang's army wants to fight a civil war, I will use this gun to fight him to the death." Fang Chongyou, an honorary soldier from Fangzhuang Village in Yutai County, was wounded last October in the self-defense battle against the Chiang army's attack on the liberated areas and returned to his hometown after being demobilized. Now, seeing the Chiang army relying on American aid to launch a large-scale attack on the liberated areas, he is extremely angry and has once again shouldered the rifle that accompanied him in the fight against the enemy for eight years, to go to the front lines again. In Peixian County, village cadres took the initiative to join the army last month, and recently, a conscription movement has been launched. Within five days, 320 young men from the county, armed with guns, rushed to the front lines, determined to resist the Chiang army's offensive.
    [Another Dispatch] The workers in the border area are supporting the front lines with high production enthusiasm. Wang Chuangao, a worker in a bomb factory, had already asked for leave to go home and marry his wife. Hearing that Chiang Kai-shek was determined to expand the civil war, he tore up his leave slip, saying: "I will go home and marry my wife after Chiang Kai-shek's invading army is driven away." The workers have automatically organized a competition. The output of bombs from the bomb factory has broken past records for many years. Each person averages more than 20 bombs per day. The workers proposed "Make a few more molds and kill a few more reactionaries." In the past, each sand-turning worker cast more than a dozen molds per day, but now it has increased fourteen-fold. One worker cast 1,400 molds in one breath, creating the highest record. The number of sawed targets has also increased from 2,000 to more than 6,000, with the most exceeding 8,000. Pharmaceutical workers also automatically requested to increase working hours, and 200,000 packages of Renzhou have already been manufactured. The masses and militia stationed in the factory area have proposed to protect the factory and strictly prevent special agents from sabotage. Clothing and shoe factories have completed more than 100,000 sets of clothes and shoes for the troops. The wave of rear support for the front lines has excited all the soldiers on the front lines. Their unanimous response is: We will definitely smash the reactionaries' offensive.
    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 16th Dispatch] News of the great victory of our army's counter-offensive on the Longhai Front has spread, and a wave of army support has been set off in Heze City. On August 14th, in just half a day, the people automatically donated 2 million yuan (equivalent to 10 million legal currency). Mr. Mao Boxuan, manager of Jiaotong Pai Cigarette Factory, donated 100,000 yuan. An eighty-year-old white-haired old woman on Huoshenmiao Street, upon hearing that the Eighth Route Army had won a victory, took 2,000 yuan early in the morning, leaning on her crutches, to see the local garrison, saying: "You are shedding blood for the common people. I am donating some money. Comrades, please don't laugh at me." Workers in various factories have donated several hundred yuan of their daily wages. Fang Anbang, a young apprentice from Sanma Pai Cigarette Factory, eagerly donated one month's salary of 1,000 yuan. More than 40 representatives from the Heze Municipal Government, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Commercial Federation, Women's Federation, Student Federation, Children's Corps, etc., entrusted by the people, formed a comfort team, carrying dozens of cartloads of pigs, sheep, watermelons, grapes, cigarettes, towels, socks, and other gifts, and rushed to the battlefield on the 14th to comfort the patriotic soldiers on the front lines.
