    [Our newspaper, Handan, 17th dispatch] More than 1,500 cadres from directly subordinate organs of the Border Region held a "Oppose National Betrayal and Persist in Independence, Oppose Civil War and Defend Peace" patriotic self-defense war mobilization meeting at the Border Government Auditorium on the afternoon of the 17th. Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Government personally attended and gave a report on war mobilization and organization. After analyzing the current civil war situation being frantically carried out by the traitorous bandits, Vice Chairman Rong pointed out: In the area surrounding our region, the Kuomintang's attacking forces have increased to 350,000 people. Kuomintang American-style aircraft are also carrying out brutal bombings against peaceful residents in Yongnian, Wenxi, Dongming, Jining and other places, and the flames of civil war of the traitorous bandits have rapidly expanded in our border area. Then, Vice Chairman Rong pointed out: In the Jinan and eastern Henan areas, the Eighth Route Army, forced to defend itself, has achieved brilliant victories. Comrades in the rear should recognize the seriousness of the current situation. The victory or defeat of this war is the key to determining China's destiny. Therefore, we must shatter the idea of complacency and carry out work and combat preparations intensively to support the front lines. We must know that only by organizing the manpower and material resources of the rear well and fully supporting the front lines can we smash the attacks of the traitorous bandits and reactionaries and realize the desire for independence, peace and democracy. At this point, Vice Chairman Rong loudly called on all cadres and 30 million people in the region to resolutely support the call of the CCP Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Central Bureau to "Oppose National Betrayal, Oppose Civil War, and Defend Peace" and resolutely implement this call. He said: All sectors of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants in the region should be mobilized intensively and actively participate in the anti-national betrayal and anti-civil war patriotic self-defense war. The people and cadres of the entire border region should unite more closely, and expand this patriotic united front to the Kuomintang-controlled areas and Kuomintang soldiers engaged in the civil war in order to win over all forces opposing the civil war and jointly extinguish the flames of civil war. Secondly, we should mobilize young people to join the Eighth Route Army. All militia self-defense forces should learn from the heroic fighting spirit of the Pinglu militia in attacking the enemy and recovering the Zhang (Dian) Mao (Jin) highway, and widely carry out guerrilla warfare and sabotage warfare in the enemy-occupied areas and border areas of our region. Third, we should organize strong logistical work, improve the supply lines, ensure that the front-line troops have sufficient food and ammunition, rescue wounded and sick soldiers, strengthen the maintenance of rear order, and strictly prevent sabotage by traitors and spies. Fourth, continue to carry out liberation and production during the war. All work should be combined with the war, and everything should be subordinate to the front lines. Vice Chairman Rong finally called on the people of the entire region to immediately launch a warm movement to transport troops and comfort the army, and be responsible for solving all the difficulties of military families in order to relieve the front-line fighters of their worries.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 20th dispatch] The Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government's Vice Chairman Ji Fang, Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Provisional Assembly Vice Chairman Zhu Lvxian, and other representatives from organs, schools, and groups formed the Central Jiangsu Frontline慰問團 to go to various front-line areas to慰問 the brave self-defense New Fourth Army and the local people. After returning, they issued a report to all sectors in the rear, praising the rising morale, the people's spirits, the unity of the army and people, and the brilliant achievements of resolutely defending themselves, expressing full confidence in the final victory of the self-defense war. Finally, they called on all sectors in the rear to mobilize all forces to support the front lines in order to accelerate the arrival of victory.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 18th dispatch] The Frontline慰問團 led by Liu Shaobai, Vice Chairman of the Border Region参议会, and Sun Liangcheng, President of the Higher Court, carrying a large number of慰問品 and慰問 letters, set off a few days ago to the Lüliang and northern Shanxi front lines. This time, in addition to慰問ing the wounded and sick soldiers of the Eighth Route Army and the front-line fighters in the self-defense war, the慰問團 will also inspect the wartime medical care work, check the local work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, and the relationship between the army and the people in the area, and mobilize the masses to support the front lines to defend their homes.
