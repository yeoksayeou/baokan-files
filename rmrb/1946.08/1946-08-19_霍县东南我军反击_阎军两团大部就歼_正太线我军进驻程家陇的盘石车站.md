[This dispatch was] transmitted by our Yangcheng [office] on the 15th: The Taiyue Eighth Route Army, in a counter-encirclement battle at Liujiazhuang, 20 miles southeast of Huoxian on the Tongpu Railway on the 13th, annihilated the entire 207th Regiment of the 69th Division of the Yan [Xishan] army and part of the 206th Regiment. More than 500 people, including the deputy regimental commander, laid down their weapons. On the morning of the 13th, more than 5,000 Yan army soldiers of the 69th Division, assembled in Huoxian, divided into three routes and tightly encircled the area of Qinglangping, Shangleping, Chengzhuang, and Xinzhuang, 20 miles southeast of Huoxian, attempting to wipe out the Eighth Route Army stationed in the Liujiazhuang area in one fell swoop. Our army detected this, immediately broke through bravely, and launched a self-defense counterattack, counter-encircling the division. After four hours of fierce fighting, the entire 207th Regiment and part of the 206th Regiment were annihilated, and the remnants of the 205th Regiment and others fled back to Huoxian city in panic. More than 400 officers and soldiers, including Shi Liquan, the commander of the 207th Regiment, suffered unnecessary sacrifices, and more than 500 people, including the deputy regimental commander, laid down their weapons. Zhou Jianli, the commander of the 69th Division, was wounded. In this battle, a total of 2 mountain guns, light and heavy mortars, 44 small cannons, 154 light and heavy machine guns, more than 300 rifles, 39 livestock, a radio station, and a large number of bullets and shells were seized. Note: This division was transferred from Linfen to Huoxian in early July and is an elite unit equipped by Yan Xishan.

[This dispatch was] transmitted by our Changzhi [office] on the 15th: On the 12th and 13th, our army successively entered the Chengjialong station southwest of Niangziguan and the Panshi station east of Yangquan on the Zhengtai Railway (both belonging to Pingding County). All bunkers and fortifications were completely destroyed by the masses. All the puppet troops of the 10th Column of Jing Yi's [troops] stationed at the two stations were captured. Now, the entire 40-mile railway line west of Niangziguan and east of Yangquan is under our army's control. Furthermore, in the western section of the Zhengtai Railway, our army entered stations such as Mashou, Shanghu, and Duanting at the beginning of the month. Under the counterattack of more than 2,000 Yan and puppet troops reinforced from Yuci, our army destroyed the Yan and puppet fortifications on the 10th and then maneuvered and transferred to both sides of the railway, and is currently continuing the battle.
