[From Our Correspondent in Weixian] This autumn, the Zhangwei Rivers breached their banks, causing severe flooding in over three hundred villages in seven counties of Southern Hebei: Daming, Weixian, Yongnian, Chengci, Linqing, Xiajin, and Wucheng. The administrative office has urgently appealed to UNRRA and CNRRA for prompt relief to save the 140,000 affected people. Weixian is the most severely affected. Except for some sorghum that may be salvaged, the crops have been completely destroyed. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 314 villages in the seven counties have been flooded, affecting 145,981 people, inundating over one million mu of land, and destroying 9,451 houses. In addition, YuanCheng and Fudong, in the First and Fifth Administrative Regions, have also experienced flooding. These large numbers of disaster victims urgently need relief. The Southern Hebei Administrative Office is conducting investigations and providing emergency relief while appealing to UNRRA and CNRRA to send personnel to the disaster areas for inspection and to provide reasonable relief based on the severity of the situation. According to investigations, the relief effort requires approximately 530 million yuan, over 2 million jin of rice, and over 5 million jin of wheat.

[From Our Correspondent in Heze] Since the beginning of the fu period, continuous heavy rains have caused flooding in the eastern part of Kunshan (a newly established county between Dongping and ShouZhang). Half of the county's fields and crops have been submerged. On July 20th, a surge of rainwater from the Dongping Lake area turned over twenty villages, including Jinshan Dam, into a watery expanse, completely submerging the fields and crops, and collapsing many houses. On July 23rd, three more surges of rainwater flooded many fields and gardens. The local democratic government is currently working to provide emergency relief.
