[From Our Correspondent in Changzhi] When our army entered Laiyuan Town, Qixian County, after the retreat of the Zhao Yan Regiment of the Yan Army's 37th Division, our military reporter found the streets deserted, every store looted, and broken debris scattered all over the place. The few remaining old and weak people in the town slowly emerged from the empty alleys, weeping and appealing to us as if we were their own relatives. After comforting and questioning them, we learned that before the Yan army retreated, they spread rumors saying: After they retreated, the central government's planes would use atomic bombs to flatten Laiyuan, and ordered the people to evacuate completely, otherwise they would be considered "traitors." On July 25th, they began arresting young men and sending them to Xiang Zihong, and in a few days, more than 200 people were arrested from Laiyuan Town and Nanshan Tou village. Civilian livestock and carts were also seized. The first thing they looted was grain, searching every household, confiscating even a single liter or a single scoop. The second step was to loot the goods in the stores, and finally, they searched every house for farm tools and furniture, transporting them to Xiang Zihong day and night, even large pots were robbed. Those items that could not be transported were destroyed. Three days before the Yan army retreated (that is, on the 28th), they ordered the people to evacuate, whipping them to get them on the road. The cries shook the sky, the terror was tragic, rarely seen in ancient and modern times. In addition to allocating grain for emergency relief to the remaining old and weak in Laiyuan, our Qixian Command has ordered the entire county's armed forces to strengthen their siege of the Yan puppet regime in order to rescue the forced masses. At the same time, a large number of leaflets were distributed to expose the Yan puppet's rumors, publicize our policies, and call on those who were driven away to find ways to escape back. Currently, the county's independent battalion and militia joint defense team have been deployed near Zihong and are actively engaged. The Yushe militia company, led by Director Li of the county's Armed Forces Committee, has also rushed to reinforce them. Some of those who were arrested and forced to leave have already escaped back, and the county government has set up a reception center to temporarily accommodate them.

　　阎军临逃抢劫物资裹胁青壮
    来远镇老弱沉痛申诉
    我祁县政府拨粮急赈
    【本报长治讯】随军记者随我军进入阎军三十七师赵衍团退出之祁县来远镇时，街市空无一人，商店家家被抢，破碎杂物，狼籍满街。镇内仅存的少数老弱，慢慢从空巷中走出，向我们痛哭申诉，如见亲人。经安慰询问后，始知阎军撤退前即放出谣言谓：彼等撤退后中央飞机就用原子弹炸平来远，并下令人民必须全部撤退，否则以“通叛”论罪。七月二十五日即开始抓捕壮丁向子洪押送，数日间来远本镇及南山头等村被抓去二百余人。民间牲口，大车亦全被抓去。开始抢掠首为粮食，挨户搜查，虽一升一合亦被没收。第二步即抢掠商店货物，最后挨门搜抢农具及家具，日夜向子洪运送，连大锅均被抢光，运不走的即被破坏，阎军撤退前三日（即二十八日）即下令人民撤退，鞭策就道，哭声震天，恐怖凄惨，古今少见。我祁县指挥部除拨粮急赈来远孑余老弱外，并下令全县武装加强对阎伪围攻，以解救被迫群众。同时大批散发宣传品，揭破阎伪谣言，宣传我们政策，号召被驱走者设法逃回。现该县独立营及民兵联防队，已布置于子洪附近积极活动。榆社民兵连亦在该县武委会李主任带领下赶往增援，被抓与被迫走群众已有逃回者，县府特设招待所一处临时收容。
