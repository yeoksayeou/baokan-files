　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan on the 9th] The Eighth Route Army in northern Henan's Meng County, forced into self-defensive counterattacks, is continuing to expand its victories. On August 3rd, after the Eighth Route Army recovered Potou, Dianshang, Quanyi, Hengjian, and other places, the puppet 17th Division's 51st Regiment and Wei Ansheng's troops regrouped in Baipo, Yezhu, and the east and west Yangshu areas. On the morning of the 4th, under the cover of two aircraft, they launched a fierce attack on us. After a day and night of intense fighting, the invading army was annihilated by our forces, and Yezhu, North Chen, South Chen, and the east and west Yangshu areas were recovered by us. On the 5th and 6th, three battalions of the 17th Division successively crossed the Yellow River from Tiexie in Henan to reinforce them, but they were all annihilated by us, and Jili was recovered by us. In four days of fighting, we captured one mortar, fourteen heavy machine guns, thirty-eight light machine guns, over nine hundred rifles, and sixteen thousand bags of flour. We killed and wounded over one thousand five hundred officers and soldiers of the puppet 17th Division's 51st Regiment, including the deputy commander Su Youshan, and over one thousand officers and soldiers of the 17th Division, including the division commander Wang Guodong, laid down their weapons. On the evening of the 7th, over two thousand Chiang Kai-shek soldiers from Henan continued to reinforce Baipo from Tiexie, launching a fierce attack on us. Intense fighting is still ongoing.
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan on the 6th] The Kuomintang 90th Army, which crossed the Yellow River and invaded Potou, Baipo, Yezhu, and other areas of our Meng County on January 14th (after the ceasefire order took effect), has used this as a springboard to attack the Henan-North Liberation Area for the past half year, building over two hundred bunkers and attacking us over sixty times, brutally killing over five hundred cadres and civilians. After the Kuomintang's 53rd Division reinforced the Jin-South civil war battlefield in early July, the defense of Meng County was taken over by the Kuomintang-reorganized puppet 17th Division. This puppet division, together with the Kuomintang security forces on the south bank of the Yellow River, formed the Luo (Yang) Meng (Jin) Heng (Shui) Command, unifying the command of local teams and organizing Henan-North fugitive traitors and special agents to expand their attacks on our Henan-North area. Our army was forced to launch a self-defensive counterattack on the evening of August 3rd, recovering Potou, Dongzhai, Baipo, Quanyi, Dianshang, and other places in Meng County occupied by the Chiang and puppet troops, capturing fifteen machine guns and over a hundred rifles, and over two hundred Chiang and puppet troops laid down their weapons.
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan on the 7th] From January 13th, after the ceasefire order, to the end of June, our Eighth Route Army in the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu area was forced into self-defense. According to very incomplete statistics, there were over one thousand three hundred battles, large and small, recovering five county towns, including Dongming, Jiang County, Wenxi (occupied again by the Chiang army on July 11th), Fushan, and Meng County, and over four hundred and ten villages and towns. We eliminated and wounded fifteen thousand nine hundred and four Chiang and puppet troops, captured thirty-six thousand six hundred and seventy-one, and six thousand four hundred and fifty surrendered or revolted. We captured twenty-four thousand one hundred and forty-three rifles and carbines, one thousand and seventy-one light and heavy machine guns, nine hundred and fifty-five pistols, six mobile machine guns, one hundred and one submachine guns, forty-four mortars, seven mountain guns, two hundred and ninety grenade launchers, fifteen small cannons, four hundred and twenty-five thousand and forty-five rounds of rifle ammunition, fifty-two thousand eight hundred and fifty-two grenades, four hundred and forty-one mules and horses, two hundred and fifty-eight telephones, twenty radios, eleven radios, one hundred and twenty textile machines, and many other spoils of victory. About one thousand and six hundred of our soldiers also died for the cause of defending independence, peace, and democracy.
