　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th. The 79th US Congress officially adjourned on the 1st of this month and will not reconvene until the new Congress is formed on January 3rd of next year. Before the adjournment, bills regarding peacetime military training, army unification, military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, extensive plans for establishing military cooperation with other American countries (to beautify the military equipment of Latin American countries and place them under US military control), and allowing the US to send military delegations to certain countries (including China. Note: The US military delegation currently stationed in Chiang's army is based on the President's wartime powers act, but the President's wartime powers have long since terminated on June 30th) were not passed. The New York Times deeply regretted this.

　　美国会正式休会
    军事援蒋案未予通过
    【新华社延安五日电】美七十九届国会已于本月一日正式休会，直至明年一月三日新国会成立时始行复会。在休会前，对承平时期军事训练，军队统一，军事援蒋，建立与其他美洲国家军事合作之广泛计划（为美化拉丁美洲各国军备并使之处于美军事控制之下），准美派遣军事代表团至若干国家（包括中国在内。按：目前美国派驻蒋军之军事代表团，系根据总统战时权力法案而来，现总统战时权力久已于六月三十日终止）等法案均未予通过，纽约时报对此深表痛惜。
