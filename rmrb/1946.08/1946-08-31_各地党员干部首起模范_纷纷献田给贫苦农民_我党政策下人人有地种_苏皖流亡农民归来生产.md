　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] To assist poor farmers in achieving liberation and to quickly realize the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's (CPPCC) resolution of "Land to the Tiller," Party cadres in various border regions have been persuading their families to donate land for poor farmers to cultivate, amounting to over two thousand mu so far. Comrade Wang Tangwen, Secretary of the Yicheng County Committee of the Taiyue Region, whose family was a well-known landlord in Yuanqu, wrote to his father at the beginning of the rent reduction and interest rate reduction campaign, stating: "As a revolutionary cadre, my family should become a model in implementing government decrees and realizing our Party's advocacy of 'Land to the Tiller.' I hope that we can proactively implement thorough rent reduction and interest rate reduction for tenant farmers." He also proposed to the Yuanqu Farmers' Association that "rent reduction in the Third District can start with my family." At Comrade Wang's request, over two hundred Farmers' Association cadres, village cadres, and tenant farmers conducted a detailed five-day accounting at his home. Wang returned eight manor estates totaling over 500 mu of land, 30 cave dwellings, 20 oxen, over 50 shi of grain, and 300 yuan in cash to over 30 tenant families, including Wang Zikang and Fan Maobai, and wrote and delivered the documents on the spot. The farmers also, recognizing Comrade Wang Tangwen's dedication to the revolution and his contributions to the people, specially retained 38 mu of land and six houses to take care of his family's livelihood. Comrade Wen Zhongliu, Director of the Yuanqu Economic Bureau, also persuaded his father, Mr. Wen Boxue, to donate three manor estates totaling over 200 mu, two oxen, three thatched sheds, and twelve cave dwellings to several farmers, including Che Dashun, leaving only eight mu to maintain their livelihood. Mr. Wen Boxue also politely declined the farmers' offers of more assistance.
　　Comrade Gao Muhong, a member of the Border Region Cultural Circle and Director of the Taihang Literary Federation, donated over 50 mu of land in mid-August. Comrade Gao personally returned to his hometown (Wu乡 - Wu Xiang) to handle the formalities, inviting farmers like Mi Haiqing to the county government to draw up a land donation agreement, and repeatedly instructed the farmers to engage in production and build their families. Comrade Liu Longju of the Third Sub-district Command of the Jinnan Military Region has once again donated 70 mu of land to the people of his village. Including the 70 mu returned to tenant farmers when Handan was liberated last year, Comrade Liu has donated 140 mu of land, leaving 60 mu for his family to maintain their livelihood. Comrade Liu said to the masses at the meeting: "The landlord class has occupied land and exploited farmers for thousands of years. This exploitation should have been abolished long ago, and the land should be returned to the farmers who cultivate it." Comrade Mu Jianhua of the Wuan Sub-committee also recently sent a letter to the Wuan County Committee, forwarding the Zanhuang County Committee's decision to donate all of his personal 17 mu of land to poor farmers and wrote a letter to persuade his father to donate land. The Zanhuang County Committee replied to Comrade Mu, stating: "Your donation of your only 17 mu of land demonstrates your commitment to the Party's land policy and the class character of a Communist Party member who loves the farmers." Following Comrade Mu, Mr. Wang Yu, a teacher at the Xituyu Elementary School, also donated 100 mu of irrigated and dry land, 120 rooms, three mules, and furniture to the farmers. In addition, Comrade Hao Guozhen, a correspondent for the Taihang Xinhua Daily in Heshun, also recently donated his 20 mu of land to the farmers. Comrades Shen Yulin, Gao Fengzhen, and Wang Jingpu from Zuoquan have also donated land and houses to the farmers.
　　The exemplary actions of the above Party members and cadres have been praised by all sectors of society. The farmers who have acquired land also deeply feel the sincere love of the Communist Party members and cadres for the masses and have all expressed that they will respond to Chairman Mao's call to engage in production and build a prosperous liberated area.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Huai'an, 28th - After the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government implemented the CPPCC's resolution of "Land to the Tiller," many farmers who had been exiled to Beijing and Shanghai to pull rickshaws and work as peddlers under the rule of the enemy, puppets, and feudal lords have returned. In the three villages of the Eqian Township in Shitou District, Huai'an alone, more than 20 people have returned to engage in production on the land they have obtained. Xu Xiangcheng from Zhengang Village, because he could not pay the public grass tax, had his house demolished by the puppet army and was forced to pull a rickshaw in Nanjing. His wife and children fled to relatives for shelter. After the establishment of the democratic government, his wife returned home, and the government helped rebuild the house and distributed land to him. He joyfully returned to his hometown after receiving a letter from his wife. Chen Ziyin from Zhao Village used to gamble, drink, and indulge in prostitution. Once, he lost money and even sold his wife. Someone advised him to work in the fields, but he said, "What's the point of working in the fields? The grain grown still belongs to the officials." Then his family drove him out, and he had to take one of his children to Nanjing to pull a rickshaw. As a result, he couldn't earn money pulling a rickshaw after a year, and his child died. Now he has also returned and is working hard in production. Xu Kaisan from E Shang Village, his family of eight cultivated five mu of land belonging to the landlord. After paying rent and taxes, there was no grain left. He got angry and joined the 117th Division of the Chiang army. Once, a battalion commander was robbed by bandits near his home and accused him of being the mastermind, and he was severely beaten. So he fled to Nanjing to pull a rickshaw at night. Not long ago, he returned from Nanjing and received five mu of land and three mu of paddy fields. Every day he also catches fish in the river and pickles them with salt. Now he enjoys the cool air and plays the huqin every night, and his family no longer worries about hunger. He requested to join the army to defend his hometown, but the government advised him to concentrate on production and do a good job in the rear service because his eyesight was poor at night.

　　各地党员干部首起模范
    纷纷献田给贫苦农民
    我党政策下人人有地种
    苏皖流亡农民归来生产
    【本报特讯】为帮助贫苦农民翻身，迅速实现政协“耕者有其田”决议，边区各地党员干部纷纷说服自己家庭，献田给贫苦农民耕种，前后已达两千余亩。太岳翼城县委书记王唐文同志，家庭为垣曲著明地主，减租减息开始时，王即致书其父称：“我身为革命干部，我家应成为执行政府法令的模范，实现我党“耕者有其田”主张，望能主动向佃户进行彻底减租减息”，并向垣曲农会提出“三区减租可先从我家开始”。在王同志要求下，农会干部村干部佃户二百余人到他家进行了五天的详细清算，王将庄田八处共土地五百余亩，窑房三十座，耕牛二十头，粮食五十余石，现洋三百元，退还佃户王自康、樊茂白等三十余家，并当场书写文书，交付农民。农民亦以王唐文同志献身革命，有功人民，特留土地三十八亩，房子六座照顾其家庭生活。垣曲经济局长文中流同志，亦说服其父文博学先生将三处庄田二百余亩、耕牛两头、草棚三座、窑十二孔，献给农民车大顺等数家，只留下八亩维持生活，文博学先生并婉言谢绝了农民更多的照顾。
    边区文化界参议员太行文联主任高沐鸿同志于八月中旬献出土地五十余亩。高同志亲自返里（武乡）办理手续，将农民米海清等请至县府缮写献田文约，并再三嘱咐农民好好生产发家。冀南三分区司令部刘龙驹同志，又一次将土地七十亩献给本村人民，连同去年邯郸刚解放时退还佃户之七十亩，刘同志已献田百四十亩，家中留下六十亩维持生活。刘同志在大会上对群众说：“地主阶级占有土地剥削农民已经几千年了，早就应该把这种剥削取消，将土地归还耕种的农民了”。武安分委穆建华同志亦于日前致函武安县委转达赞皇县委，将其个人所有之全部土地十七亩献给贫苦农民，并写信劝其父献田。赞皇县委复函穆同志称：“你将仅有的十七亩土地献出，表现了你执行党的土地政策及热爱农民的共产党员阶级品质。”继穆同志之后，以西土域小学教员王瑜先生亦将其水旱地百亩，房百二十间，骡子三头及家具等件献给农民。此外，和顺太行新华日报通讯员郝国珍同志亦已于日前将自己土地二十亩献给农民。左权干部申玉林、高凤振、王镜普等同志亦纷纷献田产房屋给农民。
    以上党员、干部之模范行动，深得各界赞扬；获得土地之农民亦深感共产党员、干部对群众真诚热爱，均表示将响应毛主席号召好好生产，建设繁荣的解放区。
    【新华社淮安二十八日电】苏皖边区政府，实行政协“耕者有其田”的决议后，过去在敌伪和封建统治下流亡京沪拉黄包车做小贩的农民，仅淮安石塘区鹅钱乡三个庄就回来了二十多人，在已得的土地上从事生产。该乡阵岗庄徐香成，因缴不出公草被伪军拆了房子逼到南京拉车，老婆孩子逃到亲戚家避难。民主政府成立后，老婆回了家，政府帮助把房盖好又分得了地，他接到老婆的信欣喜的回到了家乡。赵庄陈子银，以前吃喝嫖赌，有一次输了钱把老婆也卖了。有人劝他下田，他说：“下田干什么呢？长的粮食还不是老官的。”接着家里人把他赶出去，他只好带着一个孩子跑到南京拉车。结果混了一年，拉车挣不了钱，孩子又死了，现在也回到家努力生产。鹅尚庄徐凯三，全家八口种了地主五亩田，除了缴租和捐税之外就剩不下粮食了。一生气就去蒋军一一七师当兵，一次有个营长走到他家附近被土匪抢劫，诬他是主谋，将他毒打一顿，于是他就在夜里逃跑到南京拉车。不久以前，从南京回来分得五亩田和三亩秧田，每天又到河里捉鱼用盐腌起，现在他每天晚上乘乘凉拉拉胡琴，一家老小也不愁饥饿。他要求参加军队保卫家乡，政府因他眼睛夜盲，劝他好好生产把后方勤务做好。
