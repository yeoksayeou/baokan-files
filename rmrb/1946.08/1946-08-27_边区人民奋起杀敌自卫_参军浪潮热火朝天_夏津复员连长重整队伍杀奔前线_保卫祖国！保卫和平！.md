　　[Handan, 21st dispatch] The people of various border regions, in order to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, defend the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance, and protect the benefits gained in the emancipation movement, have launched an enthusiastic enlistment campaign. In addition to fully supporting the Jinan Front in July, the people of the Taiyue Liberated Area, in coordination with our main forces, dealt a great blow to the invading Chiang's troops. In mid-month, outstanding young people from various counties enthusiastically poured into the Eighth Route Army. In Gaoping, Jincheng, Changzi, Tunliu, Yicheng and other counties alone, more than 10,200 people joined the army. Gaoping originally estimated that 1,000 people could join the army, but encouraged by the patriotic enthusiasm for self-defense, the young people launched an enrollment competition, resulting in 2,500 young people from the county joining the army within seven or eight days. In Jincheng, at a mass meeting, as many as 500 people collectively signed up to join the army. In some counties in southern Hebei, the youth enlistment movement is equally enthusiastic. Mr. Dong Chengkui, an old man from the fifth district of Quzhou, only achieved emancipation after the Eighth Route Army liberated the area, and is now living a free and happy life. When he heard that Chiang Kai-shek was launching a large-scale attack on our border area, he angrily sent his son to the Eighth Route Army, and repeatedly told him: "If Chiang Kai-shek comes, our common people will not be able to live. After you go to the front line, you must remember: don't come back if you don't drive away the stubborn army." This kind of enthusiastic hatred of the enemy made the enlistment achievements in Quzhou and Feixiang counties in southern Hebei far exceed the expected number. In the Taihang area, the enthusiasm of the masses in the new area to join the army is as active as the emancipation. In many villages, entire platoons and squads of militia poured into the Eighth Route Army. In the entire Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, in addition to supporting the Longhai Self-Defense Front day and night, 20,000 young men have also joined the people’s army. Currently, a mass enlistment upsurge is continuing to expand throughout the region.

　　[Special dispatch from Weixian] In southern Hebei, enlisting in the army for self-defense has become a hot trend, and those who enlist are enthusiastically supported by men, women, old and young. Village-level cadres pull horses and lower stirrups, women and children vie to offer flowers, and the elderly bring fat wine and meat for farewell. Every village is filled with gongs and drums, holding farewells with slogans such as "Fathers send their sons to the battlefield, mothers send their sons to fight Chiang Kai-shek", which are overflowing in the clear sky of southern Hebei. Liu Zhixin from the sixth district of Quzhou is a poor peasant who used to rely on renting land for a living. After last year's rent reduction movement, the family's life has improved. His son, Shutong, is 25 years old this year and is currently the leader of the militia squad. When he heard that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking the liberated areas and that the old Americans were helping, he became angry. He said, "Now Chiang Kai-shek has become the second Wang Jingwei, and the United States has become the second Japan. Anyway, poor boys can't live." He discussed joining the army with his father. Zhixin had long known that Chiang Kai-shek would not let the poor people turn over, so he encouraged his son to join the army. On this day, the whole village held a meeting to bid farewell. He stood on the platform in the middle of the street and shouted: "The devils are gone, and the old Chiang is here to make trouble again, not letting us live in peace. Shutong, don't come back if you don't drive them back." Four or five hundred people saw them off, cheered in unison, and applauded thunderously. Cao Liyan, an old man in his sixties from Dazhai Village in the third district of Qinghe, heard that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking the liberated areas, glared his eyes and stomped his feet, saying: "Chiang Kai-shek is really hateful, I will also join the army and fight him." The whole village persuaded him, saying: "You are too old, it won't work." Cao Liyan said: "My youngest son is only fourteen years old, what should I do?" Everyone persuaded him: "Fighting Chiang Kai-shek doesn't necessarily mean going to the front line, you can do some work for the families of those fighting the war at home." Hou Guangling from the fifth district of Xiajin used to be a company commander in the 20th Regiment, and Zhang Weisheng and Zhang Shixian were instructors. After the announcement of the Three Great Agreements this spring, they were demobilized and returned home to farm. Hearing that Chiang Kai-shek was destroying the liberated areas, it aroused common indignation. The three of them couldn't even bother to eat, so they went to gather the old soldiers of their company. Now they have reorganized their troops and set off for the front line.

　　边区人民奋起杀敌自卫
    参军浪潮热火朝天
    夏津复员连长重整队伍杀奔前线
    保卫祖国！保卫和平！
    【邯郸二十一日讯】边区各地人民为粉碎蒋介石的进攻，保卫抗战胜利果实，以及翻身运动中所得的利益，展开了热烈的参军运动。太岳解放区人民，除七月即全力支援晋南前线，配合我军主力，给进犯蒋军以极大打击外，本月中旬，各县优秀青年，又热烈的涌进了八路军，仅高平、晋城、长子、屯留、翼城等县，即有一万零二百余人参军。高平原估计可有一千人参军，但因自卫爱国热情的鼓励，青年们展开了报名竞赛，致七八天内，全县从军青年达二千五百余人。晋城在一次群众大会上，集体报名参军者，竟达五百人之多。冀南有些县分青年参军运动亦同样热烈。曲周五区董成魁老先生，在八路军解放后，才翻了身，现在正过着自由幸福的生活，这次听到蒋介石大举进攻我边区，遂气愤的将自己儿子送入八路军，并再三嘱咐说：“蒋介石来了，咱们老百姓就不能活了，你去前线后，一定要记住：不打走顽固军，不要回来。”此种同仇敌忾的热情，使冀南曲周肥乡等县参军成绩，远远超过了预期的数目。在太行区，新区群众参军的热情，也同翻身一样的积极，许多村庄，民兵整排整班涌入八路军。在冀鲁豫全区群众除星夜支援陇海自卫前线外，亦有两万青壮参加子弟兵，现全区群众性的参军热潮正在继续扩展中。
    【本报威县讯】冀南各地参军自卫已成热潮，参军者受到男女老少的热烈拥护。村级干部拉马坠蹬，妇女儿童争着献花，老人们则拿来了肥美的酒肉饯行。每个乡村都在锣鼓喧天，举行欢送“父亲送子上战场，母亲送儿打老蒋”的口号，洋溢在冀南原野的晴空中。曲周六区刘知新是个贫苦农民，过去专靠租地过活，去年减租运动后全家生活得到改善，他儿书同今年二十五岁，现任民兵班长，听说老蒋进攻解放区，还有老美帮忙，便气胀了肚子，他说：“现在老蒋成了二号汪精卫，美国成了二号日本，反正穷小子不能过。”随和父亲商量参军，知新早就知道老蒋不让穷人翻身，便鼓励儿子参军。这天全村开会欢送，他站在街中的地台上大声高呼：“鬼子完了，老蒋又来捣乱，不叫过安生日子，书同你打不退他们别回来。”四五百送别者齐声欢呼，掌声雷动。清河三区大寨村六十多岁的老头曹立言听说老蒋进攻解放区，把眼一瞪，脚一跺说：“蒋介石这小子真可恶，我也参军和他拚命去。”全村群众都劝他说：“你岁数太大了，不行。”曹立言说：“我小儿才十四岁这怎么办？”大伙劝说：“打老蒋不见得非上前线，你在家给抗属做点活就算。”夏津五区侯光岭过去在二十团当连长，张为生、张士贤当指导员，今春三大协定公布后复员回家务农，听到蒋介石摧残解放区，引起共愤，他们三人连饭也顾不得吃，就去召集自己连队的旧战士，现已重整队伍开赴前线。
