　　Strong Protest!
    Kuomintang Reactionaries Plot to Attack Jiaozuo, Threatening the Safety of My Representative in the Xinxiang Group
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th] In the middle of this month, the Kuomintang authorities in Xinxiang and the Kuomintang representatives in the Xinxiang Group suddenly subjected the CCP representatives in the group to unreasonable intimidation. Using the Guo Ziqi incident as a pretext (Note: This incident occurred on June 18th, entirely due to a misunderstanding, and the matter has not been resolved.), they refused to guarantee the safety of the CCP representatives, including Major General Huang Zhen, and forcibly: (1) Restricted Major General Huang Zhen and others from moving freely, confining them to the group's compound at all times and forbidding them from going out. (2) Moved Huang and others to the headquarters of the 31st Army Group, effectively placing them under surveillance. The CCP representatives in the Beiping Executive Headquarters, upon receiving the above information, lodged a protest, arguing that the Kuomintang's manipulation of the Guo Ziqi incident and its threat to the safety of the CCP representatives in the Xinxiang Group were preparations for its planned attack on Jiaozuo and the Liberated Areas of northern Henan, attempting to prevent the group from monitoring and stopping such acts of aggression.

    国民党反动派图进攻焦作  威胁新乡小组我代表安全
    【新华社延安二十九日电】本月中旬，新乡国民党当局及新乡小组国民党代表，突对该小组中共代表施行无理恫吓，于借口郭子祺事件（按该事件发生于六月十八日，完全出于误会，且此事件未解决。）对中共代表黄镇少将等之安全拒绝保证，并强迫：（一）黄镇少将等不得自由行动，任何时间皆限于小组院内，不得外出。（二）将黄等移至三十一集团军总司令部，实行变相的看守。北平执行部中共代表接获上述消息，提出抗议，认为国民党玩弄郭子祺事件，威胁新乡小组中共代表安全，乃为其谁攻焦作及豫北解放区的准备，企图使该小组无法监视及制止此种侵犯行动。
