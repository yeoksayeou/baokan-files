Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 24th: According to a Nanjing dispatch from the Ta Kung Pao: Regarding the Li and Wen case, the headquarters of the Democratic League here has formally requested the government to move the trial to Nanjing for a public hearing, with participation from all parties. According to a spokesperson for the Democratic League: This case has attracted worldwide attention, and since the perpetrator is an officer of the garrison headquarters, it cannot be resolved hastily in Yunnan. The Democratic League hopes for a cautious and swift handling of the matter.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 23rd: Chongqing Report: After Liang Shuming and Zhou Shimin of the Democratic League arrived in Kunming on the 6th, they held a talk with the Kunming press on the 8th, stating: Regarding the assassinations of Li and Wen, the Democratic League demands that the government, the Democratic League, and impartial legal experts organize a special court for a public trial in Nanjing, to reassure the people. If the government handles it single-handedly, the Democratic League cannot recognize it. It is reported that after Liang and Zhou observed the trial in Kunming on the 15th, they sent a letter to Gu Zhutong (note: Gu was sent to Kunming by Chiang Kai-shek to handle the Li and Wen case) stating: "After observing the Li and Wen case, we found many doubts in the case. Please do not make a final decision." The two men have obtained results from their investigation of the Li and Wen case in Kunming and flew to Shanghai by plane on the 22nd. Before leaving, Liang told reporters that after returning to Nanjing, he would announce the investigation process and the information obtained at an appropriate time to let the people understand the truth of the case.
