　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th. The CCP Yan'an Headquarters has entrusted Zhou Zijian, Director of the Eighth Route Army Xi'an Office, to represent General Li Xiannian in negotiations with the Executive Headquarters' 32nd Group, which recently arrived in Xi'an. The negotiations aim to demand that the Kuomintang army cease its attacks on the CCP Central Plains Military Region's break-out troops and to adopt all effective measures to quickly resolve the issue of food supply for the CCP troops. After the Kuomintang army launched an attack on the CCP Central Plains troops on the 26th of last month, General Li Xiannian issued a statement demanding a ceasefire and prompt mediation. Although the Kuomintang side had to send a mediation group, it actually mobilized more troops and insisted on "annihilating" our break-out troops, making mediation impossible. The 32nd Executive Group, which recently arrived in the Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei triangle area, also sent a letter by airplane to Li Xiannian's troops, requesting him to send representatives to Longjuzhai, west of Shangnan County in southern Shaanxi, for talks before the 26th. However, Li's troops were under heavy siege by the Kuomintang army, and their location was far from Longjuzhai. Furthermore, there were no necessary means of transportation at the time, meaning that even if representatives were sent immediately upon receipt of the letter under normal conditions, it would be impossible for them to reach Longjuzhai on time. The CCP hopes that these negotiations can be concluded in Xi'an.

　　延安总部委托西安办事处长代表李先念与执行小组谈判
    【新华社延安二十八日电】中共延安总部，业已委托八路军西安办事处处长周子健氏，代表李先念将军，与日前飞抵西安之执行部第三十二小组进行谈判，要求国民党军停止对中共中原军区突围部队的攻击，并采取一切有效办法，迅速解决中共部队粮食供给等问题。按自国民党军于上月二十六日向中共中原部队开始进攻后，李先念将军即发表谈话，要求停攻，迅行调处。国民党方面虽不得不派出调处小组，但实际则调动更多兵力，坚持“围歼”我突围部队，以致调处无法进行。日前到达豫陕鄂三角地区之第三十二执行小组，又以飞机投函李先念部，限其于二十六日以前派代表至陕南商南县西之龙驹寨会谈，惟李部正被国民党军猛烈围攻，其位置离开龙驹寨很远，当时又无必要的交通工具，即依平时条件自收到公函时起，派代表按日赶到龙驹寨，也不可能。中共方面希望此项谈判能在西安得到结果。
