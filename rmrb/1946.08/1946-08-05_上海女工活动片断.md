Snippets of Shanghai Women Workers' Activities

Nearly 200,000 women workers in Shanghai play an extremely important role in the labor movement. In industrial trade unions with women workers, women workers serve as members of the council and supervisors. Taking the trade unions in the three districts as an example, women workers account for seven-tenths of the council and supervisors in the textile industry trade union, one-fifth in the dyeing and weaving industry trade union, one-sixth in the wool textile industry trade union, and one-tenth in the silk weaving industry trade union. Due to the increasing awareness and activities of women workers, outstanding women worker leaders have emerged in the trade unions. For example, in the Hudong District, the well-known ones include Lu Jingfen, Chairperson of the Trade Union of Shenxin Factory No. 6; Gu Lianying, Chairperson of the Trade Union of Weitong Yarn Factory (automatically elected as a National Assembly representative by Shanghai women); Tang Shiying (National Assembly representative), Standing Committee Member of the Trade Union of China Textile Factory No. 14; Xu Weifang (National Assembly representative), Standing Committee Member of the Trade Union of Yizhong Factory No. 3; He Xiufeng, Standing Committee Member of the Trade Union of Dakang Yarn Factory; Fan Cuiyun, Council Member of the Shenxin Trade Union; and Xu Xujun, Council Member of the Armed Pharmaceutical Factory Trade Union. In addition, Pan Yueying, a woman worker from Huxi who was elected as a National Assembly representative with the second-highest number of votes, and Tang Guifen (a woman worker from a yarn factory), also a National Assembly representative, are also famous women worker leaders in Shanghai. Their work in the trade unions often surpasses that of male workers, earning the support and love of the majority of workers.

In order to improve their cultural level, they squeeze time out of their heavy housework of washing clothes, cooking, and taking care of children, and from their sleep time, to attend night schools and literacy classes after twelve or thirteen hours of work every day. For example, in Shenxin Factory No. 9 and Shen Erzhong Factory…the majority or all of the students in the night schools are women workers. Many female employees serve as their teachers. Women workers from chemical and pharmaceutical factories with higher cultural levels, and female telephone operators from telephone companies, actively participate in cultural activities such as dramas, singing, and wall newspapers. The women workers also raised funds through "flower selling" and other means to establish maternity clinics, organize nurseries, and build civilian obstetrical hospitals. This spring, under the unified action of the "Lianyi Association," they resolutely elected their own National Assembly representatives (a total of five women workers were elected, as mentioned earlier) and bravely participated in the recent 100,000-person anti-civil war parade. In an undemocratic tradition and a discriminatory environment against women, and in the face of insults and enticements from labor scabs and secret agents, they still strive to continuously raise their awareness, unite their strength, and fight together with male workers and the people of the whole country for China's peace and democracy.

　　上海女工活动片断
    上海将近二十万的女工，在工运中起着极重要的作用。在有女工的产业工会中，都有女工担任理监事，以三区各工会来说，纺织业产业工会理监事女工占十分之七，染织业工会占五分之一，毛织业工会占六分之一，丝织业工会占十分之一。由于女工觉悟的提高和活动的增加，在工会中产生了出色的女工领袖，如在沪东区著名的有申新六厂工会理事长陆静芬，纬通纱厂工会理事长顾莲英（上海妇女界自动选出的国大代表），中纺十四厂工会常务理事汤世英（国大代表）颐中三厂工会常务理事徐伟芳（国大代表），大康纱厂工会常务理事何秀凤，申新工会理事范翠云及武装药厂工会理事徐蓄君等，此外以第二位最多票数当选国大代表的沪西女工潘月英，国大代表汤桂芬（纱厂女工）等，也都是上海的著名女工领袖，她们在工会工作，成绩往往超过男工，得到广大工友的拥护和爱戴。
    为了提高文化，她们每天在十二三小时的工作之外，从洗衣烧饭带孩子的繁重家务和睡眠时间里，挤出时间进夜校识字班，如申新九厂和申二中厂……夜校，求学的大部或全部是女工。许多女职员担任他们的教员，文化较高的化学厂药厂的女工和电话公司的女接线生，都积极参加戏剧歌咏壁报等文化活动。女工们并以“卖花”等款创办产妇诊疗所，筹办托儿所，和平民产科医院。今年春天在“联谊会”的统一行动下，毅然选出了自己的国大代表（女工共选出五名见前），和勇敢地参加最近一次的十万人反内战大游行。她们在不民主的传统和歧视女性的环境下，在工贼特务的侮辱和利诱的困难条件中，仍努力不断的提高觉悟，团结力量，与男工及全国人民一起为中国的和平民主而奋斗。
