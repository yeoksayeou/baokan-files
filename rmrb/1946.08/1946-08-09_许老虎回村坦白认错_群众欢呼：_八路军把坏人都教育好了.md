　　Xu "Tiger" Returns to Village to Confess Mistakes
    Masses Cheer: "The Eighth Route Army Has Educated the Bad Guys Well!"
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] As the mass movement deepens, in the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district, soldiers who had previously eaten the enemy's or puppet's grain, and who had harmed the interests of the masses in the past, have been actively asking for leave to return to their villages to confess their wrongdoings to the masses. Through concessions by the masses and mediation by cadres, many outstanding issues in the villages have been resolved. The progress of this work has further united the military and the people, and further consolidated the troops. The report regarding Xu "Tiger," a soldier in the Xiuwu Independent Battalion, returning to his village to confess is as follows: Xu is from Henghe Bian Village in Xiuwu. Due to difficult living conditions, he joined the puppet bandit Liu Mingde's unit and participated in several acts of plunder and murder against the village. This spring, during the "anti-奸" (anti-traitor) and "speak bitterness" campaign in the village, his problem was also raised. After hearing about this, Xu felt deeply uneasy. However, he had also received education for a long time, his awareness had increased, and he believed that as long as he confessed his mistakes, he would definitely be forgiven. Therefore, he voluntarily asked for leave to return to his village to resolve the issue. After discussing with the village cadres, he requested a meeting to confess. When the meeting was announced by the cadres, the atmosphere was silent, and the masses did not raise any opinions. Xu then handed over his weapon to the cadres and declared to the masses: In the past, because I was in the bandit troops, I did things that wronged the masses, but now I have joined the Eighth Route Army and have received education. The weapon I am carrying now is to protect the masses, and I hope everyone will not be afraid. Only then did the masses raise their opinions about him. Xu then thoroughly confessed one by one, admitting his mistakes and denouncing Liu Mingde's many crimes. Seeing that he confessed thoroughly, the village cadres stepped forward to mediate, explaining that after joining the Eighth Route Army, he had abandoned evil and returned to good, and was determined to serve the people wholeheartedly. The meeting immediately broke into discussions: The Eighth Route Army is good; it educates the bad guys into good people. The masses then shouted: "Forgive him, forgive him!" Cui Changjing (Cui Changgong's younger brother), the victim, jumped up and said: "Xu 'Tiger,' it's nothing. You killed my brother, but I know you were forced by others. We are now one family; whatever is said is over." At this time, Xu "Tiger," the cadres, and the masses were all moved to tears. Xu repeatedly saluted and apologized to Cui. Finally, a unanimous decision was made: Forgive Xu "Tiger" and let him work hard in the army in the future. After the meeting, Xu, accompanied by the cadres, went to the deputy village of Henghe Bian Village to confess his mistakes to the masses. (Zhao Ming)

　　许老虎回村坦白认错
    群众欢呼：“八路军把坏人都教育好了”
    【本报长治讯】随着群运深入，太行四分区各部队中，曾在顽、伪吃过粮，过去对群众利益有过损害的战士，均纷纷主动请假回家向群众坦白悔过。经群众让步、干部调解，解决不少村中遗留的问题，这一工作的进行，使军民更加团结，部队也更加巩固。兹将修武独立营战士许老虎回村坦白报导如后：许是修武横河编村人，曾因生活所迫参加伪匪刘明德部，参加过几次匪部对该村的掠杀罪行。今春该村反奸诉苦时也提他的问题。许闻知后，内心深觉不安，但他也受了多时教育，觉悟提高，相信只要坦白认错，一定能得到原谅，即自动请假回村解决，经与村干部商议，要求开会坦白。开会时，干部宣布后，会场沉寂，群众不提意见，许即将武器交给干部，向群众声明说：过去因在土匪部队，对群众有对不起的地方，但现在已经参加八路军，受过教育，现在带的武器，是保护群众，希望大家不要害怕。这样群众才提出对他的意见，许即一一彻底坦白，承认了自己错误，并控诉了刘明德许多罪恶。村干部见他坦白彻底，即出面调解，说明他参加八路军后，改邪归正，要坚决为人民服务的决心，会场当即纷纷议论：八路军就是好，把坏人都教育成好人了。群众即高喊：“原谅他，原谅他！”苦主崔长敬（崔长功弟）跳起来说：“许老虎，没有啥，你打死了我哥哥，我知道你也只是受人逼迫，咱现在是一家人，有话说了就算。”这时，许老虎、干部、群众都感动得说不出话来，许即向崔连连敬礼认错。最后一致决议：原谅许老虎，让他今后在部队里好好干。会后，许又随干部到横河编村的副村向群众坦白认错。（赵明）
