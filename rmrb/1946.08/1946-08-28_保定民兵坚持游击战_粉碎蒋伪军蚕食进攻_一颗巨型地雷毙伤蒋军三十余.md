　　Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 25th—The Baoding liberated area militia, with tenacious guerrilla warfare, has crushed over 200 piecemeal offensives launched by Chiang's troops with a force of over 17,000 since April, killing and wounding over 200 Chiang and puppet soldiers. They successively recovered strongholds such as Wanxin, Lamadi, and Liuxu, and liberated over 20 surrounding villages. In mid-April, when over a thousand Chiang soldiers forcibly crossed the Jinxian River, attempting to invade Zhongdaza and Nandaza (southeast of Baoding), the militia detonated a series of linked landmines, killing 78 Chiang soldiers. Due to the disparity in numbers, they actively withdrew from their positions. They encircled the two villages with a network of landmines, and at the same time, dispatched small groups of militia to cross the river and infiltrate areas occupied by Chiang's troops, such as Goutou, Balizhuang, Beidaza, and the outskirts of Baoding, actively carrying out activities. They destroyed a Chiang military transport vehicle and killed and wounded three Chiang officers and soldiers. The arrogance of Chiang's and puppet troops was greatly reduced, and small units dared not move freely, eventually forcing the main force stationed in Nandaza to withdraw north of the river (Jinxian River). In the past two months, the militia on the east side of the Pinghan Railway have also crushed over 20 offensives by Chiang's and puppet troops against the liberated area of Diaoxianzhuang. A certain village single-handedly repelled eleven Chiang troop offensives and recovered over 20 carts of wheat. A dense array of landmines once killed 18 Chiang soldiers. On July 13th, when Chiang's and puppet troops set out for Dahuaqiao, they triggered a giant landmine, resulting in over 30 Chiang soldiers being killed or wounded, and an American-made machine gun was also blown to scrap metal.

　　保定民兵坚持游击战
    粉碎蒋伪军蚕食进攻
    一颗巨型地雷毙伤蒋军三十余
    【新华社河间二十五日电】保定解放区民兵，曾以顽强的游击战争，粉碎蒋军从四月以来以一万七千余兵力的二百余次蚕食进攻，毙伤蒋伪军二百余人，先后恢复宛新、喇嘛地、刘叙等据点，解放周围村庄二十余处。四月中旬蒋军千余人，强渡金线河，进窥中大再、南大再（保定东南）时，民兵拉响连环地雷阵，炸毙蒋军七十八名后，以众寡悬殊，主动撤离阵地。以地雷网将该二村团团封锁，同时派遣小股民兵渡河潜入蒋军侵占的沟头、八里庄、北大再和保定城郊积极活动，曾炸毁蒋军运输汽车一辆，毙伤蒋军官兵三名，蒋伪凶焰乃大大收敛，小股兵力不敢自由行动，最后被迫将驻南大再的主力，撤回河（金线河）北。近二月来，平汉路东侧的民兵，亦粉碎了蒋伪军二十余次向解放区雕贤庄的进攻。某村并单独击退蒋军十一次进攻，夺回小麦二十余车，以密布的地雷阵一次炸毙蒋军十八名。七月十三日蒋伪出发至打花桥时，触发一枚巨型地雷，蒋军伤亡三十余名，一挺美式机枪也被炸成废铁。
