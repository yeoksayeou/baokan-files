Go Fight the Enemy, Don't Mind Me!
    In Memory of Comrade Wu Baolin
    On February 25th, the sky was very gloomy, and it was snowing lightly. More than two hundred Yan [Xishan] troops attacked our Zhengtai Team's Third Squad again. The troops quickly entered their positions, because no one believed that any "agreements," "accords," or "ceasefire orders" could restrain the Yan troops and the Japanese anymore.
    The enemy quickly outflanked us from the left wing. Captain Cai pointed to the mountain top on the left with the signal flag pole, and said to Wu Baolin: "Squad Leader Wu! Take men to seize this mountain top, run quickly! Hold the position, don't let the enemy come up."
    Habit made him reply "Yes!"
    The enemy's artillery and machine guns launched a fierce attack, obviously this was the main attack direction.
    Under the bombardment of artillery and the roar of machine guns, five or six enemies began to charge, once, twice... they were all repelled. Then the enemy's reserves also joined in, heavy machine guns fired continuously, everyone was particularly nervous, some said: "Watch this one!" When they attacked the front line, Baolin commanded the whole squad to throw more than two hundred hand grenades, scattering the enemies in all directions, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
    The infantry retreated, and the artillery began to bombard us again. Where the shells landed, thick smoke rose up, and the dust sprinkled on the soldiers was patted off by everyone. The strong smell of gunpowder choked our noses, but we acted as if nothing had happened.
    Unfortunately, a shell flew over and blew off both of Baolin's feet. Fresh blood gushed out, staining the blue stone red, and splashing all over his legs, but Comrade Baolin still did not leave the front line. He couldn't stand to throw grenades, so he crawled to the front of the fortifications and gritted his teeth to throw three more grenades. Finally, after Captain Cai's repeated persuasion, he left the fighting post of defending peace. The deputy platoon leader was very touched and personally escorted him for half a mile. Comrade Baolin raised his head from the stretcher and said: "Deputy Platoon Leader! Go back! Tell the comrades: strive to defend peace, eliminate the enemies who destroy peace, don't mind me, I'm fine."
    But when the stretcher reached Black Peak Village, he gloriously sacrificed himself due to severe injuries and excessive blood loss. The comrades who followed the stretcher brought the news of Comrade Baolin's sacrifice to the company. Immediately, the company's clamor and singing turned into silence, and from silence into anger. The instructor clenched his fists and said: "We must defend peace! Avenge Comrade Baolin!"
    The comrades shouted together, "Yes, wipe out the reactionaries and avenge Comrade Wu Baolin!" (Liu Zhi).

　　去打敌人，不要管我！
    追念武保林同志
    二月廿五日，天阴霾的很，而且下着小雪。阎日军二百多人，又向我们正太队三分队进攻来了，部队很快进入阵地，因为谁也不再相信什么“协议”“协定”“停战命令”能约束住阎军和日本人。
    敌人急急的从左翼迂回过来，蔡队长用联络旗杆指着左边山头，向武保林说：“六班长！带人抢占这个山头，快跑！坚持阵地，不让敌人上来”。
    习惯使他答了声“是”！
    敌人的炮机枪猛烈进攻起来，显然这是主攻方向了。
    炮轰和机枪的怒吼下，五六个敌人开始冲锋，一次二次………都被打退了。接着敌人预备队也参加了，重机枪不停的连放，大家精神特别紧张，有的说：“看这一下吧！”攻到前沿时，保林指挥全班打了二百多个手榴弹，打的敌人东跑西窜，大家才松了口气。
    步兵败回去了，炮兵又向我们轰起来，炮弹落处，浓烟突起，撒到战士身上的尘土，大家顺手拍一拍，强烈的硝烟味，窒息着我们的鼻子，我们若无其事。
    不幸，一颗炮弹飞来，将保林的两脚炸没了，鲜血涌流，染红了青石，也溅满了两腿，但保林同志仍不下火线。他不能立着拚手榴弹，他爬到工事前沿，又咬着牙拚了三个手榴弹，最后经蔡连长再三劝说，他才脱离了保卫和平的战斗岗位。排副很受感动，亲自送他半里地。保林同志从担架上抬起头来说：“排副！你们回去吧！告同志们说：努力保卫和平，消灭破坏和平的敌人，不要管我，我不要紧。”
    但，担架走到黑峰村，终因伤重流血过多，他光荣牺牲了。跟担架的同志，把保林同志牺牲了的消息带到连上，立刻全连的喧哗、歌唱变成了寂静，由寂静变成了愤怒，指导员捏紧拳头说：“我们要保卫和平！为保林同志复仇！”
    同志们一齐高喊着“对，把反动派消灭干净，为武保林同志报仇！”（刘志）。
