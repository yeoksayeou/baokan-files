Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: Beiping dispatch: The 25th Special Team of the Military Mediation Department investigating the Anping incident held a meeting on the 5th. The Kuomintang representative, Wu Ningting, used the fact that the Chinese Communist Party representative, Huang Yifeng, was the Director of the Transportation Department of the Executive Headquarters as an excuse, attempting to cancel Huang's qualification to attend. The Chinese Communist Party representative, Huang Yifeng, refuted this based on reason, pointing out that all three parties of the Executive Headquarters had the right to appoint their own representatives, and no party had the right to cancel this right of other parties. Huang also presented a certificate stamped by the three members of the Executive Headquarters to prove his completely legal status. The American representative, Davis, also believed that the issue raised by the Kuomintang representative was too unreasonable and should not be discussed at the meeting. However, the Kuomintang representative continued to make trouble unreasonably, claiming that if this issue was not resolved, he would refuse to participate in the meeting. This went on for a whole day, resulting in no outcome from the meeting. While the Kuomintang representatives are doing their best to obstruct the 25th Special Team from going to Anping for investigation, Chiang Kai-shek's side is fabricating "evidence" to frame the Chinese Communist Party, and Chiang's troops have launched a large-scale offensive against Xianghe and Baodi.

　　军调部调查安平事件  国民党代表无理阻挠
    【新华社延安八日电】北平讯：军调部调查安平事件之第二十五特别小组于五日开会，国民党方面代表吴宁庭，竟以中共方面代表黄逸峰为执行部交通处长为借口，妄图取消黄氏之出席资格。中共方面代表黄逸峰据理驳斥，指出执行部三方面皆有委任自己代表之权，任何方面无权取消其他方面这一权利。黄氏并取出执行部三委员盖章之证，借以证明他的完全合法的地位。美方代表戴维斯亦认为国民党方面代表所提问题太不合理，会议不应加以讨论。但国民党方面代表，仍无理取闹，声称此问题若不解决，即将拒绝参加会议。这样闹了一天，致会议无结果。在国民党代表尽力阻挠第二十五特别小组赴安平调查之际，蒋方正在伪造嫁祸于中共的“证据”，蒋军并已大举向香河、宝坻进攻。
