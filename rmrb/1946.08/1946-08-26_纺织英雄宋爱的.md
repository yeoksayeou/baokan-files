　　Textile Hero Song Ai's
    Lin Li
    "She was a hero in her own family, and she's a hero in her husband's family. She's been a hero for three years now. She's truly an outstanding figure in Southern Hebei!" – When Commissar Han of Jize and the people talked about Song Ai, they always said this repeatedly.
            Leading Textile Production to Overcome Disaster
    In the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], Southern Hebei experienced a major famine, which was even more severe in Jize. Families fled famine, and people died in every village. Song Ai's two elder brothers took their wives and nephews to Shanxi, leaving behind their old mother and her. Her husband's family had no food either. Everyone said that she would starve to death. The anti-Japanese government distributed cotton, calling on people to spin and weave to save themselves, weaving a bolt of cloth in exchange for twenty-one jin of grain. But the people, who had been deceived by the old government, doubted that they could get grain in return. It was at this time that Song Ai stepped forward: "As long as there's food, I dare to do it." She took the cotton and went door-to-door to persuade people, but she only found four people. Later, when people saw her constantly bringing back grain, they changed their tune: "The anti-Japanese government doesn't deceive people." At this time, the number of people participating in textile production increased to twenty, and they formed three groups. Everyone weaved cloth in exchange for grain, and they all had food and drink. But as time went on, disagreements arose in the group, with those who worked faster feeling that they were at a disadvantage. Song Ai persuaded and advised them and discussed a solution with everyone: set fifteen work points for each bolt of cloth from spinning to weaving (each bolt of cloth requires three jin of thread), spinning six liang of thread counts as one work point, weaving counts as three work points, reeling counts as half a work point, warping and dressing count as one work point, beaming and threading count as one work point, and beating counts as half a work point, and then distribute the profits according to work points. This motivated everyone. In less than two months, Song Ai's group wove forty-seven bolts of cloth, earning nine hundred and seventy-eight jin of grain.
            Elected as a Labor Hero
    During the spring plowing season, the government called on people to pull plows, but the villagers said, "This is not something that humans are born to do!" They especially looked down on women. But the starving women responded to Song Ai's call to "start with textiles" and implemented an exchange of labor. Women with large feet did fieldwork, while women with small feet spun yarn at home, stipulating that plowing one mu of land was equivalent to spinning nine liang of thread.
    Since Song Ai led the textile production, not a single person starved to death in Song Village. Song Ai and her mother not only did not starve to death, but also bought two mu of land. That year, the county held a labor hero conference, and she was elected as a textile labor hero.
            A Thorn in the Side of Feudal Landlords
    After the disaster passed, her elder brother and sister-in-law returned. They saw that Song Ai had completely changed, running around busily with work every day. People from the village, district, and county all came to talk to her about work. Her brother and sister-in-law were a bit unhappy, secretly saying, "This girl is going crazy." The feudal landlord Song Guozhen in the west of the village took the opportunity to add fuel to the fire, sowing discord: "Since the Eighth Route Army came, they've liked coming to your house." "What kind of family is this? It's ruining the family reputation." Her brother, unable to think for himself, fell for the landlord's trick and pointed out three paths to his sister: (1) Stay at home and never go out. (2) Return to her husband's family and cut off contact. (3) If she continued to "go crazy," it would be a matter of life and death. The women in the village were worried about Song Ai and told the district government about the situation. The district government had long known that Song Guozhen was a KMT [Kuomintang] spy. Later, her brother also realized that he had fallen for the landlord's trick. After she arrived at her husband's home, the corrupt landlords, like Song Guozhen, insulted her, saying, "A respectable family has produced such a daughter-in-law." Under the landlord's instigation, her parents-in-law also revoked her freedom to go out.
            A Hero in Her Own Family, and a Hero in Her Husband's Family
    After Song Ai arrived at her husband's home, the district government was calling on Fengguanying to make military shoes, stipulating that seventeen jin of grain would be issued for each pair of shoes. Again, no one in the village wanted to do it. Later, Song Ai mobilized her husband's cousin, Dong Lingniang, asking her to mobilize others and teaching her how to organize women. Soon, the peasant movement in this village toppled the feudal system with great fanfare. Song Ai told Dong Lingniang: "If there's a stumbling block, women cannot progress." So they joined forces with the workers' and peasants' association to launch a struggle against Bao Eniang, who was hated by the entire village for abusing poor women. From then on, the women raised their heads, and Song Ai, like in her own family, led a textile group five or six times larger than the one in Song Village. A new legend was once again praising her: "With Song Ai in Fengguanying, we can wear new clothes every year."
            Everyone in the Village Spins Yarn and Every Family Weaves Cloth
    In Song Village, girls in their teens and old ladies in their sixties could spin yarn, and young and middle-aged women could weave cloth. It truly achieved the goal of everyone spinning yarn and every family weaving cloth. The seventeen textile groups under Song Ai's leadership had ninety-seven textile women who "could weave and spin." There were a total of fifty-four looms and ninety-seven spinning wheels. In the first half of the year, they had woven five hundred and thirty bolts of cloth, purchasing a total of one thousand five hundred and ninety jin of cotton, equivalent to four hundred and seventy-seven thousand yuan.
            The People of Jize Praise Song Ai
    In Jize, everyone, young and old, knows about Song Ai. She not only leads women in production, but also leads women in emancipation. She is a female leader who is both cultured and martial. Under her long-term influence, families have also been transformed. Now, when she attends meetings and works, her mother-in-law happily takes care of her children, and her backward father-in-law has even been elected as the director of the preferential treatment for soldiers' families. The people of Jize are all praising her. She is a twenty-four-year-old young woman of medium height. She has a special kind of wisdom, and when she talks about work, she shows great魄力 [pòlì - boldness] and courage. She is now a representative of the women's association and is leading the broad masses of women in their emancipation.

　　纺织英雄宋爱的
    林里
    “在娘家是英雄，到了婆家也是英雄，英雄的称号已三年了。她真是冀南的出色人物！”——鸡泽韩政委和人们谈到宋爱的时候，总是再三的这样谈。
            领导纺织渡灾荒
    三十三年冀南大灾荒，在鸡泽更厉害，真是家家逃荒，村村死人。宋爱的两个哥哥带着嫂侄上了山西，留下老娘和她。婆家也没吃的，谁不说她两会饿死呢？抗日政府发下棉花，号召纺织自救，织一个布，换二十一斤谷子。但被旧政府骗怕了的人民，都怀疑不能换回粮食。宋爱的就在这时出了头：“只要有吃，我就敢”。她接了棉花，并挨家去劝说，可是只找到了四个人。后来人们见她不断领来粮食，便都改了话头：“抗日政府不哄人”。这时参加纺织的就增加了二十个，编了三个组，大家织布换谷子，都有了吃喝。但日久天长组里又起意见，做活快的嫌吃亏。宋爱的就左说右劝和大家商量了个办法，把一个布从纺到织定为十五个工，纺线六两顶一个工，（每个布三斤线）织布顶三个工，缠缠顶个半工，浆浆络络顶一个工，经经条条掏掏顶一个工，打打顶半个工，然后按工分红。这样大家都起了劲，不到两个月，宋爱的小组就织了四十七个布，赚谷子九百七十八斤。
            被选为劳动英雄
    春耕时政府号召人拉犁，村里都说：“这活天生不是人干的！”对妇女更是看不起。但饥饿中的妇女却响应了宋爱的“纺织先去”的号召，并实行了换工。脚大的做地里活，脚小的在家纺花，规定锄一亩地，顶纺九两线。
    自从宋爱的领导纺织后，宋庄再没有饿死一个人。宋爱的和她娘不但没有饿死，而且还买了二亩地。这年县里召开劳英大会，她被选为纺织劳动英雄。
            封建地主们的眼中钉
    灾渡过后，哥嫂回来了。他们看到宋爱的完全变了，天天东跑西跑忙于工作。不论村里区里县里都有人找她谈工作。哥嫂有点看不惯，暗地说：“小妮要疯了”。村西头封建地主宋国桢便趁机火上加油，大施挑拨：“八路军一来，就喜欢到你家。”“这算个什么人家，败坏门风”。哥哥脑筋不开，上了地主的当，向他妹妹指出三条路：（一）在家做活永不出门。（二）回婆家断绝来往。（三）要是再“疯”下去，就是你死我活。村里妇女们都替宋爱的担忧，把这情况都告诉区上。区上早知道宋国祯是国特。后来哥哥也知道上了地主的当。她到了婆家，逢官营的地主和宋国祯一样污辱她说：“老老实实的人家出了这么个媳妇”。公婆在地主挑拨下，也取消了她的出门自由。
            在娘家是英雄在婆家也是英雄
    宋爱的到婆家后，区里正叫逢官营做军鞋，规定每双鞋发谷子十七斤。这村同样也是没人愿做。后来宋爱的就动员本家嫂子东领娘，叫她去发动，并教给她组织妇女的办法。不久这村农民轰轰烈烈的闹翻身运动，宋爱的便告诉东领娘：“有了绊脚石，妇女便不能进步。”于是她们便联合工农会，向虐待贫苦妇女为全村痛恨的保娥娘开展斗争。从此妇女们抬起了头，宋爱的又像在娘家一样，她率领了一个比宋庄大五六倍的纺织组。一种新的传说又在替她歌颂着：“逢官营有了宋爱的，年年就能穿新衣”。
            全村人人纺花家家织布
    在宋庄，十来岁的小姑娘和六十岁的老太太都能纺花，青壮年妇女都会织布，真正做到了人人纺线，家家织布。在宋爱的领导下的十七个纺织组，就有九十七个纺织娘“能织能纺”。共有五十四架织布机，九十七辆纺花车。前半年已织出了五百三十个布，共购棉花一千五百九十斤，合洋四十七万七千元。
            鸡泽人民赞颂着宋爱的
    在鸡泽，提起宋爱的，男女老少人人皆知。她不但领导着妇女生产，而且领导了妇女翻身。她是一个文武双全的妇女领袖。在她的长期影响下，家庭也得到改造。现在她开会工作时，婆婆愉快的给她看孩子，落后的公公居然也被选为优抗主任。鸡泽的人民都在赞颂着她。她是一个二十四岁的青年人，中等身材。她有一种特有智慧，一说起工作，就显示出很大的魄力和勇气。她现在当看妇女会的代表，正领导着广大的妇女闹翻身。
