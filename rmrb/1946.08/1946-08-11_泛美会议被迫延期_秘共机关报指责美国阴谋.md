Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: Due to opposition from democratic individuals and groups in Pan-American countries, the Pan-American Conference, promoted by the United States, has been forced to postpone its meeting repeatedly. The conference was originally scheduled for July but failed to take place. Later, Brazil (the host country) suggested holding it in November, but Benes stated in Paris on the 7th that the timing was "not yet ripe." The purpose of this conference was to discuss how to implement the Chapultepec Act, which was passed in Chapultepec, Mexico. This act stipulates that the Western Hemisphere will implement joint defense under the control of the United States. The people of Latin American countries unanimously oppose the plan of American imperialists to control the military and defense of Pan-American countries under the guise of joint defense. U.S. congressmen, also mindful of the upcoming elections, have not dared to rashly pass the Pan-American countries' extensive military cooperation plan (i.e., arming and training the armies of these countries to suit U.S. standards for easy control). These reasons have forced the Pan-American Conference to be postponed again and again. However, it is worth noting that U.S. Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower has arrived in Brazil to engage in activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: TASS, Washington dispatch: Mexico's "El Demócrata" newspaper reported that Latin American protests against the U.S. plan to "defend" the Western Hemisphere are growing. The Peruvian Communist Party's newspaper "La Voz del Trabajo" stated that accepting this plan would subordinate Latin American countries to the U.S. military, thereby strangling their sovereignty. The United States, under the guise of modernizing the armaments of the republican nations, is concealing its imperialist monopolistic conspiracy to sell us weapons and increase their profits, and these weapons can be used to incite civil war when it is in their interests. "La Voz del Trabajo" condemned the United States for continuing to occupy the Peruvian base of Iquitos.

　　泛美会议被迫延期  
    秘共机关报指责美国阴谋
　　【新华社延安八日电】在泛美各国民主人士与团体的反对下，美国主催的泛美会议被迫一再延期举行，此一会议之会期曾定为七月，然未能举行，后巴西（东道口）建议十一月举行，而贝纳斯于七日在巴黎表示，认为时机“尚未成熟”。按此次会议之目的，为讨论如何实行曾在墨西哥洽普特匹克城通过之洽普特匹克法案，此一法案，规定西半球在美国支配下实行共同防卫。对于美国帝国主义分子企图借共同防卫之名以行控制泛美各国军事与国防之实的计划，拉丁美洲各国人民一致反对。美国会议员对于泛美各国广泛军事合作计划（即武装与训练各该国军队以适合美国标准便于控制），亦鉴于改选在即，未敢贸然通过。这些原因遂使泛美会议一再被迫延期。惟美陆军参谋总长艾森豪威尔已抵巴西活动，值得注意。
    【新华社延安八日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：墨西哥“拉开的密斯”报报导：拉丁美洲对美国“防御”西半球计划的抗议，正日益增长。秘鲁共产党机关报“劳工”报称：接受此计划，即将使拉丁美洲各国从属于美国军队，因而绞死他们的主权。美国借使共和国家武装近代化的名义，掩盖自己帝国主义垄断的阴谋，以售给我们武器，增强他们的利润，而此种武器在有利于他们的利益时，可以作为煽起内战之用。“劳工”报谴责美国继续占领秘鲁基地伊巴托。
