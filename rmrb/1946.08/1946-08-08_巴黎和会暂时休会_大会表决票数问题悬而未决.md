Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 5th: The Paris Peace Conference has concluded its first week of work. During this week, representatives from 21 nations have delivered speeches at the general assembly, generally outlining their respective countries' policies toward the Paris Peace Conference. The plenary session must be temporarily adjourned pending the completion of work by the Rules of Procedure Committee, which will then submit a report on the rules of procedure to the assembly. The meetings of the Rules of Procedure Committee play a crucial role at the beginning of the conference. In their general resolutions, the Council of Foreign Ministers presented six recommendations regarding the rules of procedure to the conference. The discussions of the Rules of Procedure Committee last week were based on these recommendations. Five points have been passed, three of which are relatively important: firstly, the procedure for establishing a motion. The decision was: "Regarding any issue related to the draft treaty, the General Assembly may include it in the agenda upon the request of any delegation." Secondly, the organizational law of the political and economic committees for reviewing the draft treaties. The decision was: "Representatives from the 21 nations can participate in the review committee of the five-nation treaties. However, countries that did not declare war on the respective countries will not have the right to vote." Thirdly, the chairman of the General Assembly. The decision was: "The four powers will take turns chairing." An important point in the rules of procedure that has not yet been decided is the number of votes required to pass a motion. This is the most debated issue in the Rules of Procedure Committee. The crux of this issue lies in the opposition of the Australian and Dutch representatives to the Foreign Ministers' decision to pass a motion with a two-thirds vote, and their insistence on a simple majority. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes made a special statement the day before the meeting: the U.S. position at the conference would be to support the results negotiated by the Council of Foreign Ministers. However, in the specific discussion, Byrnes abstained from voting on the aforementioned second issue (i.e., the organizational law of the political and economic committees for reviewing the draft treaties). This is why he did not take a consistent step with the four powers on this issue. TASS Paris reported: "Although some members of the Council of Foreign Ministers have a two-faced attitude at the conference, the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers cannot be shaken." Moscow Radio commentator Heffman also pointed out at the same time: "The consistency of the four powers is extremely important for the success or failure of the conference."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 5th: The Paris Peace Conference adjourned yesterday. Observers of the conference expect that the committees of the assembly will discuss the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland one by one. The only remaining issue in the Rules of Procedure Committee, namely the number of votes required to pass a motion, may be decided in one or two days. Bidault will issue formal invitations in the name of the 21 nations to the five smaller countries, inviting them to send representatives to Paris to state their opinions on the draft treaties. The conference has not yet determined the requests of Albania, Egypt, Luxembourg, Mexico, and Cuba that "they have the right to attend the conference." In addition, British Prime Minister Attlee returned to London during the adjournment. The British government announced on the evening of the 4th: After Attlee's meeting with Bevin, it was decided that the British delegation to the conference would be led by First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander. It is reported that Bevin may go to Paris in a few days to lead the British delegation.

### 巴黎和会暂时休会  大会表决票数问题悬而未决

　　巴黎和会暂时休会
    大会表决票数问题悬而未决
    【新华社延安五日电】巴黎和会已结束其第一周的工作。在第一周中，二十一国代表已在大会先后发表演说，一般的阐述各该国对巴黎和会的政策。全体大会须暂时休会，以待程序规则委员会完成其工作，届时程委会将向大会提出程序规则报告。程委会的集会，在和会初开时，起最重要的作用。巴黎外长会议在其一般的决议中，曾对和会提出六点关于程序规则的建议。上周程委会所讨论者，即根据此种建议。目前已通过五点，其中三点比较重要：其一为议案的成立手续。其决定为：“关于和约草案之任何问题，倘经任何代表团之申请时，大会得将其列入会议程序”。其二为审查和约草案之政治经济委员会的组织法。其决定为：“二十一国的代表均可以参加五国和约的审查委员会。但除对各该国宣战的国家外，其余国家无表决权”。其三为大会的主席。其决定为：“由四强轮流担任”。程序规则中重要的一点尚未作出决定，即关于通过议案时所需要的票数。这是程委会中争论最烈的问题。这一问题的症结，在于澳荷代表反对外长会议三分之二票通过议案的决定，并坚持过半数即可。美国务卿贝纳斯在开会的前一天，曾特别声明：美国在和会中的立场，将为支持外长会议所协商的结果。但在具体讨论时，贝纳斯曾在上述第二个问题（即审查和约草案之政治经济委员会的组织法）进行表决中弃权。这就是他在这个问题上没有采取四强一致的步骤。塔斯社巴黎电讯曾称：“虽然外长委员会的某些委员在和会上带着两面派的态度，但外长委员会的决定是不能动摇的。”莫斯科广播评论员赫夫曼亦同时指出：“四强之一致性，对于和会之成功与否极为重要。”
    【新华社延安五日电】巴黎和会昨日休会。和会观察家预料大会各委员会将逐一研讨对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案。程委会中留下的唯一问题，即通过议案时所需之票数问题，可能有一二日内即行决定。比道尔将以二十一国名义向前五小国发出正式请柬，请其派代表赴巴黎申述他们对和约草案的意见。对阿尔巴尼亚、埃及、卢森堡、墨西哥与古巴之“他们有权出席和会”的要求，和会尚未确定。此外英首相艾德礼于休会时返回伦敦，英政府于四日晚宣布：艾德礼在与贝文会谈之后，决定英国出席和会的代表团，由海相亚历山大率领。据悉，贝文或将于数日内赴巴黎领导英国代表团。
