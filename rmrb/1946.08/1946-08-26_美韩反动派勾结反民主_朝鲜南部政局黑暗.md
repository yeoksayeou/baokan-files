　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Seoul Dispatch: The US military occupation authorities in southern Korea have begun large-scale crackdowns on democratic figures in Seoul since the 14th. The Seoul garrison searched the private residence of Kim Seo-ryong, the political director of the People's Party, falsely claiming to have "discovered a large amount of intelligence related to the US military." A spokesperson for the Korean Communist Party said: This is the act of a rogue spewing venomous lies, and it clearly demonstrates the darkness of the political situation in southern Korea. They also pointed out that this action is the beginning of an anti-democratic and anti-people atrocity colluded in by US and Korean reactionaries.
