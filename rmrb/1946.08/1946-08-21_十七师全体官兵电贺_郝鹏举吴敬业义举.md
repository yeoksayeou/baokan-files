(From our newspaper in Handan) The Seventeenth Division of the National Revolutionary Army recently sent a telegram congratulating General Hao Pengju's righteous action. The original text reads:

　　To Brother Pengju and forwarded to all officers and soldiers of the Central China Democratic Allied Army:

　　Upon receiving your telegram of the eighth regarding opposition to dictatorship and civil war, all officers and soldiers cheered with excitement. We are all former subordinates of the Northwest Army and have always regarded loving the country and the people as our duty. However, the reactionary authorities of the Kuomintang not only do not reward these meritorious troops but are also bent on excluding dissidents and forcing attacks on the Eighth Route Army, which had made meritorious contributions in the war against Japan, with the aim of eliminating the miscellaneous troops in one fell swoop in the anti-communist civil war. All officers and soldiers of our division, unwilling for this Northwest people's armed force to be driven by the reactionaries to slaughter their own compatriots, revolted in Luoning, Henan Province, on July 17th last year. Brother, you share this sentiment and resolutely raised the banner of righteousness. This is not only the glory of the officers and soldiers of our Northwest Army but also a head-on blow to the dictators who insist on civil war and betray the country. It is our hope that we can jointly carry forward the glorious tradition of the Northwest Army in the future, cooperate with the Eighth Route Army side by side, and resolutely fight to the end for the independence, democracy, and peace of the motherland. We send this telegram in congratulation and extend our fraternal greetings!

　　Zhang Fuzhen, Liu Weicheng, Liang Lisheng, and all officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army 17th Division respectfully offer their regards. August 15th.

　　[Another dispatch:] All officers and soldiers of the Seventeenth Division recently sent a telegram to Battalion Commander Wu Jingye to congratulate him. The original telegram is as follows:

　　To Comrade Wu Jingye, Battalion Commander of the Second Battalion, Fifty-First Regiment, Seventeenth Brigade, Thirty-Eighth Division, forwarded by the Taiyue Branch of Xinhua News Agency:

　　Upon hearing the news of your glorious uprising against Chiang Kai-shek's selling out the country and engaging in civil war, and your arrival in the liberated area, the entire army was overjoyed. Your uprising proves once again that patriotic soldiers who demand independence, peace, and democracy, and who wish to oppose selling out the country and engaging in civil war, and seek survival, have no choice but to come to the liberated area as soon as possible. This action points out a bright path for soldiers across the country who are unwilling to sell out the country and engage in civil war, and is worthy of learning by patriotic soldiers across the country.
　　
　　We offer our regards and wish you good health!

　　Zhang Fuzhen, Liu Weicheng, Liang Lisheng, Zhang Xiding, Li Muyu, You Jixian, Lei Zhanru, Liu Xiaseng, Hao Shirong, Chen Jiamou, Zhu Manqing, Liu Ruhe, Chen Juxin, Xu Youbin, leading all officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army 17th Division, respectfully offer their regards. August 14th.

　　十七师全体官兵电贺
　　郝鹏举吴敬业义举
    【本报邯郸讯】国民革命军十七师顷电贺郝鹏举将军义举，原文称：
    鹏举兄并转华中民主联军全体将士勋鉴：
    接谈八日反对独裁内战通电，全体官兵，欢呼雀跃。吾等同系西北军旧部，素以爱国爱民为天职，乃国民党反动当局，对此有功部队，不惟不赏，反一心排斥异已，强迫进攻抗日有功部队八路军，以期在反共内战中，将杂牌部队一举消灭。本师全体官兵，不忍这支西北人民武装，再供反动派驱使，残杀自己同胞，遂于去年七月十七日在河南洛宁起义。吾兄同具此心，毅然揭起义旗，此不独为我西北军将士之光荣，亦对坚持内战出卖祖国的独裁者以当头棒喝。甚望今后共同发扬西北军之光荣传统，与八路军并肩合作，坚决为争取祖国的独立民主和平而奋斗到底。谨电驰贺，并致兄弟之敬礼！
