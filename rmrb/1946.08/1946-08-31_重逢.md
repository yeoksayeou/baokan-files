　　Reunion
    Lang Qiao
    After three days and four nights of fierce fighting – at three o'clock in the morning on the 18th – the heroic soldiers of the Eighth Route Army finally ascended the Zhao City wall, which was fortified with numerous bunkers. The Yan puppet troops hastily abandoned the city, wading across the Fen River in a disheveled state, like drowned chickens, leaving behind guns, mules, warhorses, and backpacks marked with "Iron Army Group" signs. American-style helmets, hats, leather boots, worn-out shoes… were floating on the water, sinking in the river, and thrown on the shore, scattered everywhere. However, they still could not escape being annihilated on the banks of the Fen River.

    When the loud bugle call sounded from the city wall, the people of Zhao City, who had been hiding in their homes with trepidation, burrowing in wheat stacks, and hiding in earthen caves, emerged, excitedly shouting: "Ah! Our troops are back, thank heavens, thank the earth, thank the spirits..." Some were visiting, some were hurrying to boil water and soup, and some, hearing bullets whizzing overhead, retreated back under the eaves to wait quietly...

    The troops went in turn to search the courtyards where the Yan puppet troops had resided. Citizens opened their doors, bringing out basins of boiled water. Some timid families had not yet opened their doors, but the troops did not force their way in. Instead, the people beside the doors called out: "Our own people are back, quickly open the door!" Some doors then opened with a "creak." A thief took the opportunity to sneak into the Medicine King Temple, steal a package, and carry it out, but he was caught by the discipline team. After being persuaded, he returned the package. A monk who had been hiding in the grass outside the temple from the shelling saw this and told people the next day: "This small matter shows how good the Eighth Route Army is!"

    Early in the morning, before the curfew was lifted, villagers were already waiting outside the city to enter. They had not been in the city for several years, and now they couldn't wait to fly in. Some, impatient, went around to the west city wall and crawled in through a water hole.

    Many men, women, and children were vying to pick up shell casings, shouting and calling to each other, running back and forth. Men and women in the streets and alleys were talking and laughing happily, staring at the passing troops. Some were playing chess and competing to win at their doorsteps, and some young people were wrestling and playing. It was truly rare. Some people pasted red couplets on the walls, and the whole city seemed to be in a joyful New Year atmosphere, truly a delight for everyone.

    An old woman was walking in the alley when she was approached by a comrade from the troops who asked her: "Old lady, were you frightened?" She smacked her lips and said loudly: "I still want to scold you! Why didn't you come back after you left?!" Then she smiled again, "This time you can't leave, if you leave, we'll have to leave together!"

    When the political workers in the troops spoke in the streets and alleys, the people gathered around, endlessly recounting the pain Yan Xishan had inflicted on them. A middle-aged farmer surnamed Jia sighed and said: "Alas! Yan Xishan is truly wicked. He'd rather waste ten old people to death than let one soldier die. When the troops entered, they took whatever they saw, and you didn't dare to ask a question. If something didn't please him, he'd kick and punch you, saying you were colluding with the 'rebellious Eighth'! The harvest from the fields wasn't enough for others, and they said Yan Xishan would 'reorganize' on the thirteenth, which worried people to death! No one was weeding the fields or applying fertilizer, wondering who would get their land. Fortunately, you came and saved everyone's lives. These days, they were forced to work day and night, making people's eyes bloodshot! Their whole bodies felt like the tendons had been pulled out. If you hadn't come in, people couldn't escape and would have all died."

    The troops dispatched many comrades to visit the masses door-to-door to offer comfort, and every common person said with satisfaction: "Our troops are really good!"

    Mr. Yao, a refined old gentleman from the carpentry shop on North Street, said: "The army doesn't enter civilian houses. I've lived for decades, and this is the first time I've seen it with my own eyes. You can truly be called a 'benevolent and righteous army' that 'doesn't take a single needle or thread' from the people. You used your sincerity to win over the people, while Yan's army used bayonets to win over the people. You use politics to win people's hearts, which is why you can win battles."

    The poor people in the northeastern corner of the city who made a living by carrying burdens couldn't do so these days and were forced to work all night. They had no food at home and had to provide meals for Yan's army. Hunger, fatigue, and worry were intertwined, and they were all sick in bed! Wang Guanzhu, an old man in his fifties, had been sick in bed for three days. When a comrade from our troops visited him, he suddenly jumped off the bed, grabbed the comrade's hand, and said excitedly: "You came at the right time, this has cured my illness!" He spoke and laughed, dancing and gesticulating in the room. "My illness is cured, look, my illness is really cured."

　　重逢
    朗樵
    经过三天四夜的激战——十八日早晨三点钟——英勇的八路健儿，终于登上碉堡林立的赵城城墙，阎伪军慌忙弃城，狼狈涉过汾河，像落汤鸡一样的把枪炮、驮骡、战马和挂有“铁军组”牌的背包，美式大圆盖、帽、皮靴、破鞋、……………丢的水上漂的，河里沈的，岸上扔的，到处都是。可是，他们仍逃跑不了被消灭在汾河畔上。
    当城墙上嘹亮的号声一响，提心吊胆藏在家里的，钻在麦秸堆里的，躲在土窟窿里的赵城城内的老百姓，都钻出来兴奋的喊着：“呵呀！咱们队伍回来了，谢天、谢地、谢神灵…………”他们有的在看望，有的急忙烧水烧汤，有的听着子弹从头上掠过又躲回屋檐下静待…………。
    队伍挨次到阎伪军曾住过的院子去搜查，市民们把门开开，将开水一盆盆端出来，胆小的人家还没有把门敞开，队伍也没人去推敲，门旁的老百姓却喊叫：“自己人回来了，快把门开开吧！”有的门就“吱呀”一声开开了。有一个小偷趁机钻进药王庙里偷了一包东西背出来，正碰见纠察队，经说服他又把东西送回了。在庙外草丛里躲炮弹的和尚看见了，天明便告人说：“这件小事情就知道八路军有多好！”
    清早戒严令还未解除，城外已经有等着要进城的乡下人，他们有几年没有进城了，现在他们恨不得一下子飞进去，有的等得不耐烦就绕到西城墙，从一个水洞里钻进来。
    许多男女小孩在争拾弹壳，你喊我叫，跑来跑去，街巷里男人女人都在愉快的说笑着，盯视过往的军队，有些人在门口下象棋斗胜负，有些青年人也在扭打闹玩，实在希罕，有人在门壁上贴上红对联，满城好像处在一个安乐的新年，真是皆大欢喜。
    一个老婆正在巷子里走，迎面一个部队同志问她：“老太太可受惊了吧？”她咂一下嘴大声说：“我还要骂你们哩！为什你们一走就不回来了呢？！”接着她又笑了，“这回可不能走了，要走，咱们非一齐走不行！”
    部队里的政工人员在街巷里一开口，老百姓就围拢上来，不停的不尽的给诉说阎锡山给他们的痛苦。一个姓贾的中年农民，叹气说：“唉！阎锡山真是坏透了，他＠肯糟塌死十个老百姓，也不肯死一个当兵的，军队进门见甚拿甚，问都不敢问一声。有一点不顺他的眼，就脚踢拳打，说你通“叛八”！地里打的还不够人家的，原说十三号阎锡山要“编组”，听了把人愁死啦！草也没人锄了，粪也没人上了，谁晓得把自己的地分给谁家呢？幸而你们又打来救了大家的命。这几天日夜支差，把人眼都熬红啦！浑身像抽了筋一样，你们不进来，人逃不出去，都要死完了。”
    部队派了许多同志挨门挨户向群众慰问，每个老百姓都满意的说：“咱们队伍好着哩！”
    北街板店一个文雅的姚老先生说：“军队不入民房，我活了几十年这是头一次，亲眼见到，你们真可谓“秋毫无犯”的“仁义之师”。你们拿出赤心换得老百姓，阎军拿刺刀换得老百姓，以政治服人心，所以你们能打胜仗。”
    城东北角一带凭担挑谋生的穷人，这几天不能担挑谋生，还要整夜支差，家无宿夜粮，还要管阎军饭，饥饿、疲困、忧愁三者交加，都病倒床上了！五十多岁的王官柱老汉，已病在炕上三天，当我们一个部队同志慰问他时，忽地从炕上跳下来，就拉着这位同志的手，兴奋若狂的说：“你来的好，这一下把我的病问好了！……”他又说又笑就在屋里手舞足蹈起来。“我的病好了，你看我的病真好了。”
