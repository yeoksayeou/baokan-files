　　Against British Cabinet's Plan for India
　  All-India Muslim League Launches Demonstrations
　  Demanding Partition of India and Independence for Muslims
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th—Reports from various sources: August 15th was the All-India Muslim League's "Direct Action Day" against the British Cabinet's plan for India. Anti-British demonstrations occurred yesterday in major Indian cities and London. In Bombay, all Muslim shops were closed that day, and demonstrating Muslim crowds shouted: "Britain is perfidious!" "Partition India!" No beef was available in Bombay because the city's butchers and beef vendors were all Muslims. Transportation was also paralyzed because most of the car drivers were also Muslims. The British government had previously mobilized hundreds of armed troops to patrol the streets of Bombay, but this did not intimidate the demonstrating Muslim masses. Demonstrations also broke out in Calcutta to protest the British plan for India. British troops opened fire, reportedly killing 80 demonstrators and injuring more than 800. Muslims in Delhi, Lahore, Lucknow, and other northern Indian towns followed the League's call and staged demonstrations. Muhid, a standing committee member of the Muslim League, said in a speech to a student conference: "We want to declare our independence and are prepared to fight for independence!" In London, members of the Muslim League gathered from various parts of Britain held a demonstration on the afternoon of the 15th. The procession marched through the city's main streets for two hours, led by Mohammed, chairman of the Muslim League's London branch. Demonstrators held high the Muslim League flag and banners with slogans such as "The British government goes back on its word," "Rather die than not have Pakistan," and "Take direct action."

　　反对英内阁对印方案
　  全印回盟发动示威
　  要求印回分治回民独立
    【新华社延安十七日电】各方报导：八月十五日为全印回教同盟反对英内阁对印方案的“直接行动日”，印度各大城市及伦敦于昨日发生反英示威。在孟买，当日所有回教商店均已停闭，示威的回教群众高喊：“英国背信弃义”！“印回分治”！孟买全市皆无牛肉可食，因该城之屠夫与牛肉贩皆为回教徒，交通亦陷于麻痹，因大部汽车司机亦为回教徒。事先英政府曾调集数百名武装部队巡逻孟买大街，但并不能将示威的回教群众吓倒。在加尔各答亦爆发示威游行，抗议英国对印方案，英军竟开枪射击，示威群众已知有八十人被打死，八百余人受伤。在德里、拉哈尔、勒克瑙及印度北方诸城镇的回教人士，均遵守回盟之号召，进行示威。回盟常委摩黑德于××学生大会上演说称：“我们要宣布我们的独立，并准备为独立而战！”在伦敦区英国各地汇集而来的回盟员盟于十五日下午举行示威，游行队伍通过该城各主要街道达两小时之久，领导者为回盟伦敦支部主席穆罕默德，示威群众高举回盟盟旗及写着“英政府自食其言”“不是巴基斯坦毋宁死”“直接行动起来”等口号的旗子。
