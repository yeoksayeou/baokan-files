Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: According to news received by the Overseas Chinese Federation here from the Philippines: Overseas Chinese throughout the Philippines have launched an enthusiastic homeland relief movement. Eye-catching slogans are plastered all over the Overseas Chinese districts, reading: "Relieving the homeland is like fighting a fire," "Millions of compatriots in the country are waiting to die," "Donate more money to save more lives," etc. The Women's慰劳(Comfort) Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, various guild hometown associations, and all democratic organizations have been mobilized to carry out organized fundraising campaigns. Democratic Overseas Chinese newspapers have opened long columns to report on the progress of the homeland relief movement. It is reported that a large number of relief grains and medicines have been successively shipped to the country.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Manila News: Overseas Chinese in the Philippines are expressing dissatisfaction with the Chiang Kai-shek government agencies' arbitrary theft and detention of Overseas Chinese homeland relief supplies. The Chamber of Commerce's official newspaper, the "Chinese Business News," published a message stating that the relief supplies shipped by Overseas Chinese to Xiamen were "stored" in the warehouse of the Xiamen Office of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration and left unissued. It continued: On July 20, it was discovered that the seals on the door had been torn open... Oatmeal, canned food, milk, biscuits, etc., were all poured out and messed up, and were damaged and in a terrible state, and many empty cans were found. Sardine soup was spilled all over the floor, and a large number of medicines shipped by the Women's Comfort Association were missing. When asked of the responsible personnel, they all said: "I don't know." Mr. Shi Xing-shui, one of the leaders of the Overseas Chinese in Manila, reported to the Overseas Chinese Homeland Relief Committee here that the anti-epidemic medicines sent back to the country by the Overseas Chinese, although accompanied by a certificate from the Consulate General proving that they were relief supplies, were detained by the Xiamen Customs. After repeated dredging, taxes still had to be paid before they could be released. He said excitedly: "The hometown urgently needs medicines, but the customs detain them. It's simply outrageous! We will not allow the same incident to happen again in the future!"
