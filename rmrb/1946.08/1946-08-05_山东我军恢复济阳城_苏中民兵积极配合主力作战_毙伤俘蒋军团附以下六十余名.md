　　Shandong Our Army Recovers Jiyang City
    Suzhong Militia Actively Cooperates with Main Force in Combat
    Killing, Wounding, and Capturing Over Sixty Chiang Soldiers of Regiment Level and Below
    Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 2nd: Jiyang City, 60 miles northeast of Jinan, has been recovered by the Eighth Route Army after fierce fighting. The city was invaded twice by the Chiang Kai-shek army's 12th Army New 36th Division, which attacked from Jinan on the 5th and 18th of last month. After invading Jiyang, the division demolished civilian houses to build fortifications, attempting to occupy it for a long period. It also cooperated with special agents and thugs dispatched by the Kuomintang authorities in Jinan to sabotage the Yellow River repair project in the Bohai Liberated Area, assassinating 27 river workers and civilians, and threatening the masses, saying, "Whoever goes to repair the river, we will kill their entire family," causing the levee repair project below Qingcheng to be forced to stop. With the cooperation of the broad masses of the militia, the Eighth Route Army launched a heroic counterattack on the night of the 24th of last month and recovered the city at dawn on the 25th, with the invading army fleeing towards Jinan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 1st: As the Chiang army invades Jiangsu and Anhui, the masses in the liberated areas, in coordination with the main force, rose up to defend themselves. The militia in the Suzhong Jing (Jiang) Tai (Xing) Nan (Tong) Ru (Gao) area, from the 15th to the 23rd, successively recovered Xiaohai Town, Daxiaopiegang (both 20 miles southeast of Nantong), Baimuqiao (10 miles east of Jingjiang), Mianshan Town (10 miles northeast of Jingjiang), and other places. The Jiangjing local militia severely damaged the invading Chiang army, capturing 35 Chiang soldiers including regimental adjutants, battalion commanders, and battalion adjutants, as well as one Japanese soldier. They also killed and wounded over 30 Chiang soldiers including battalion commanders. They once stormed into Jijiashi, a major town northeast of Jingjiang, and rescued over 1,000 civilians kidnapped and imprisoned there by the Chiang army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: On July 27th, the Jidong Eighth Route Army recovered Yanjiao, Maqifa, Banbidian, Baigedian and other villages and towns (all belonging to Sanhe) on the Tang (Shan) Tong (County) highway, more than 40 miles east of Beiping, capturing 150 puppet soldiers of the traitor Jiang Ziting's unit and wounding 40. Yanjiao and Maqifa were liberated by the Eighth Route Army after the Japanese surrendered last year. On January 14th this year, they were invaded and occupied by the traitor Jiang Ziting's unit of the former puppet Sanhe County Garrison, who then encroached upon 72 square li of land in 35 villages and towns including Banbidian, Daliuzhuang, and Zhongxinzhuang. They also rounded up traitors and special agents to establish a puppet Sanhe government-in-exile, with Liu Jianxun, a former translator from Sanhe, as the county magistrate, and Liu Peiya, the special agent group leader, as the head of the political group. The local people suffered from massacres and extortion. Recently, the Chiang army in Tongxian City transported a large amount of munitions, preparing to support the puppet army in launching a large-scale invasion. The local Eighth Route Army launched a counterattack against the puppet army on the 27th, removing the above four puppet military strongholds, allowing the people of dozens of villages and towns in the area to see the light of day again.

　　山东我军恢复济阳城
    苏中民兵积极配合主力作战
    毙伤俘蒋军团附以下六十余名
    【新华社惠民二日电】济南东北六十里的济阳城，经激战后已重为八路军恢复。该城曾于上月五日及十八两度遭由济南出犯之蒋军第十二军新三十六师侵占。该师于侵陷济阳后，即在城内拆毁民房修筑工事，企图长期盘居，并配合由济南国民党当局派出之特务暴徒，破坏渤海解放区的修黄工程，暗杀河工人员及群众二十七人，并威胁群众说：“谁去修河，杀他全家”，致青城以下之修堤工程被迫停顿。八路军在广大民兵配合下，于上月二十四日夜间展开英勇反击，于二十五日拂晓恢复该城，进犯军向济南逃窜。
    【新华社淮阴一日电】蒋军侵犯苏皖，所到之处，解放区群众配合主力奋起自卫，苏中靖（江）泰（兴）南（通）如（皋）地区民兵，自十五日至二十三日间，曾先后收复小海镇、大小撇港（均在南通东南二十里）、柏木桥（靖江东十里）、面山镇（靖江东北十里）等地，江靖地方民兵曾重创出犯蒋军，生俘蒋军团附、营长、营附以下三十五名及日兵一名，毙伤蒋军营长以下三十余名，并曾一度攻入靖江东北重镇季家市，救出被蒋军绑架囚禁该市之群众千余人。
    【新华社延安二日电】冀东八路军于七月二十七日恢复北平东四十余里唐（山）通（县）公路上之燕郊、马起垡、半壁店、白各店等村镇（均三河属），俘伪军姜逆子廷部一百五十名，伤四十名。按燕郊及马起垡。去年日寇投降后即为八路军解放，今年一月十四日被原伪三河县警备队姜逆子廷部侵占后，又将半壁店、大刘庄、中心庄等卅五个村镇面积七十二平方华里土地蚕食，并收罗汉奸特务成立伪三河流亡县政府，由原三河的翻译官刘建勋任县长，特务组长刘赔亚任政治组长，当地人民备遭屠杀勒索之苦。最近通县城蒋军更运来大批军火，准备支援伪军大举出犯，当地八路军乃于二十七日向该伪实行反击，拔除上述四个伪军据点后，该地数十村镇人民得以重见天日。
