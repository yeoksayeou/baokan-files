　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Youth Federation in the Liberated Areas recently sent a telegram congratulating the International Student Conference in Prague, Czechoslovakia, stating: Just as students around the world are emerging from the fires of war to concentrate on their studies, students and youth in the Chinese Liberated Areas are not only being prevented by Chiang Kai-shek from sending their representatives to attend the conference, but are also undergoing another slaughter following the Japanese occupation. The United States, while "mediating," is supplying Chiang Kai-shek's government with artillery, making it difficult to quell the flames of the Chinese civil war. In the Kuomintang-controlled cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Chongqing, Kunming and other cities, more than a thousand young students have been slaughtered and arrested by Chiang Kai-shek in July and August alone for opposing the civil war. The telegram calls on the conference to pay attention to the threat of the Chinese civil war to world peace, to provide possible assistance to the suffering of Chinese youth, and to welcome the conference to send a delegation to visit and investigate the Chinese Liberated Areas.

    电贺国际学生大会
    控诉蒋介石屠杀中国青年
    【新华社延安二十五日电】中国解放区青年联合会筹委会，顷致电祝贺捷京布拉格国际学生大会，略称：正当全世界学生走出了战争之火专心读书的时候，中国解放区的学生青年不仅被蒋介石阻挠，不能派遣自己的代表出席大会，而且正继日本宰割后的又一次屠杀。美国一面“调停”，一面大炮接济蒋介石政府，于是中国内战之火便难以收拾了。在国民党统治区的南京、上海、北平、重庆、昆明等城市，青年学生因反对内战而被蒋介石屠杀逮捕者仅七八两月份就在千人以上。该电要求大会对中国内战对全世界和平的威胁予以注意，对中国青年所受灾难予以可能的援助，并欢迎大会派遣参观团到中国解放区来参观考察。
