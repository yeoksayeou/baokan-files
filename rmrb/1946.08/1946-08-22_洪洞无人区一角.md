　　A Corner of the Uninhabited Zone in Hongdong
　　Since Yan Xishan reorganized the puppet troops in Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and Huoxian, implementing policies such as "integration of soldiers and farmers" and "credit grain purchase," countless "uninhabited zones" have been created. This is just a corner of the uninhabited zone in Hongdong.
　　Yan Xishan first appointed Zhang Conglong, the notorious and heinous puppet county chief of Anze who deserved to be cut into pieces, as the head of the Hongdong "United Committee," and then appointed him as the county chief and commander of the "Hongdong Corps." The so-called Hongdong Corps was Zhang Conglong's confidant troops. Zhang Conglong was a famous "man-eating county chief" in Hongdong. People in Subao personally saw him kill a village head in Baicun and eat his heart. People here turn pale at the mention of Zhang Conglong. Under Zhang Conglong's rule in Hongdong, coupled with Yan Xishan's various policies—"integration of soldiers and farmers," "credit grain purchase," and the civil war—"uninhabited zones" were first created in Hexi, and then in nine villages near the city, including Dongxi Fengbao, Dongxi Yongning, Sanyangbao, Sanzhoubi, and Guxian. Doors and windows were sealed with cobwebs, weeds filled the courtyards, the population fled, the land was barren, and there was no sign of human habitation within ten miles.
　　The uninhabited zones of Sanyangbao, Dongxi Yongning, etc., began to form in March of this year. At that time, although the villagers of Yongning knew that the county chief in the city was the former traitor county chief Zhang Conglong, and the troops were Zhang Conglong's traitorous troops, they had to maintain the status quo as before under the butcher knife of the man-eating Zhang Conglong. Zhang Conglong was a ruthless traitor who killed without blinking an eye, coupled with Yan Xishan's insatiable plundering policies—"integration of soldiers and farmers," "credit grain purchase," and the civil war. Regarding the "credit grain purchase," one tael of silver was used to requisition six shi of grain, and later there were assignments of meals and cloth. For example, in Yongning, Du Baode's eight mu of land yielded a total of sixteen shi last autumn, but he had to bear fourteen shi of corn, two shi of rice, fifty jin of cotton, four zhang and five chi of cloth, and over a hundred meals. If he did not hand over the grain, he would be tied up and imprisoned, and if he still could not pay, he would be sentenced to death. There were countless such incidents. After March, the common people could no longer maintain their livelihoods, but Zhang Conglong's slogan was "Rather die in battle than starve to death." What could the villagers of Yongning and other villages do? They could only flee, fleeing to villages such as Nanqin, Shiji, and Podui, and some rose up in resistance, killing the uncle of village chief Li Juru, because he colluded with Li Juru. Zhang Conglong and Li Juru then threatened Yongning village, saying they would "burn Yongning village and kill everyone, big and small," and they also opened the weir of the water channel for the villagers of Sanyangbao, wanting to starve the people of Sanyangbao to death. From then on, the common people completely fled.
　　The villages of Sanzhoubi and others were originally anti-Japanese base areas, but Zhang Conglong's evil hand also extended here, demanding grain, money, and manpower. The people of Sanzhoubi ignored him, especially when Zhang Conglong put forward "May is the month of bloodshed!" This was the final warning to Sanzhoubi, if you do not maintain the status quo, you will all be killed in May. At this time, Li Zhenxin, an old man in his seventies, was stabbed to death by Yan's soldiers in the field. Li Baocai was picking firewood in the field when he was shot to death by more than ten guns. Tragic cases occurred one after another. The common people who had struggled, especially the people of Hongdong, were not intimidated. On the contrary, it made them launch a "life-saving battle." They put forward the slogan—"Never let Zhang Conglong snatch a single grain of food, if he snatches one, he will bleed!" The fierce struggle to defend their own lives began. Zhang Conglong again threatened the masses, "All people under forty and over sixteen are militiamen, kill them all!" Under this bloody slaughter, batches of people fled to even more distant places. At first, they fled to Fengcun, Shiqiao, and Nanqin, five miles away, but Zhang Conglong chased them to Shiqiao, and they fled again to villages such as Santiaogou, more than ten miles away. But a farmer cannot forget his own land. Every morning, they secretly brought dry food back to their land to farm, and countless people were killed! Yin Zhu of Xifengbao went back to farm and was stabbed to death in the field with bayonets. These lands flowed with their sweat and were drained of their blood. Later, because they could only work four or five hours a day, and the weeds in the fields grew taller than the crops, the farmers were anxious and the whole family went to the fields. At that time, the land was dry, there were many weeds, the weather was hot, and people were hungry. They pulled weeds while shedding tears. They sighed, "What sins have we committed in generations to suffer such great torment?" Later, because of the hot weather, hunger, heavy work, they also contracted cholera and dysentery. Many people got sick, and many people died. When they saw a staff member of a democratic government, or a few Eighth Route Army soldiers, they cried out their suffering, asking the army to come and save them quickly. They could no longer wait. They were suffering from hunger, disease, and being shot to death. They had homes but could not return!!

　　洪洞无人区一角
    自从阎锡山将洪洞、赵城、霍县等伪军改编，实行“兵农合一”、“赊购粮”等政策以来，造成了无数的“无人区”。这里仅是洪洞无人区的一角。
    阎锡山在洪洞首先把罪恶昭彰、应该千刀万剐的安泽伪县长张从龙，委为洪洞“统委会”长后，又委为县长兼“洪洞兵团”团长，所谓洪洞兵团就是张从龙的亲信部队。张从龙在洪洞是出名的“吃人心县长”，苏堡的人亲眼见他杀了白村一个闾长，并吃了他的心。这里的人谈起张从龙来是谈虎变色的。洪洞在张从龙的统治下加上阎锡山的“兵农合一”、“赊购粮”……首先是在河西，其次即在城附近东西冯堡、东西永凝、三阳堡、三周壁、古县等九个村子造成了“无人区”，门窗蛛封，蒿草满院，人口逃亡，土地荒芜，十里地内无人烟。
    三阳堡、东西永凝等无人区是今年三月开始形成的。当时永凝村虽然明知城内县长是以前的汉奸县长张从龙，部队是张从龙的汉奸部队，可是在吃人心的张从龙的屠刀之下，他们不得不像从前一样的维持了。张从龙是个杀人不眨眼的汉奸，又加上掠夺无厌的阎锡山的各种政策——“兵农合一”、“赊购粮”及内战，关于“赊购粮”一项一两银子征六石粮食，以后还有派饭派布。如永凝杜宝德去年秋季八亩地共打十六石，即负担玉茭十四石，大米二石，棉花五十斤，布四丈五尺，饭一百余顿。如果不交粮食就捆去坐牢，再无法缴纳，最后处以死刑，此类事件不知有多少。从三月以后老百姓已经无法维持，可是张从龙的口号“宁愿战死，不愿饿死”。永凝等村老百姓有什办法？只有逃亡，逃到南秦、石机、坡堆等村子，也有的起来反抗，这时打死了编村村长李九如的舅父，因他与李九如狼狈为奸。张从龙、李九如这时威胁永凝村，要“火烧永凝村，大小人都劈死”，并且又把三阳堡老百姓的吃水渠的堰放开。要干死三阳堡的人，从此起老百姓完全逃亡外出。
    在三周壁等村子原来就是抗日根据地，可是张从龙的魔手也伸到这里要粮、要款、要人，三周壁的人置之不理，特别是到了五月，张从龙提出来“五月流血月！”这就是对三周壁下的最后警告，如果你们再不维持，将在五月里杀尽你们。这时就有七十多岁的老汉李振新，在地里被阎军刺死，李保才在地里拾柴，被十多条枪瞄准打死，惨案接连的发生。斗争出来的老百姓，特别是洪洞人没有被吓倒，相反地使他们展开“保命战”，他们提出了口号——“决不让张从龙抢走一颗粮食，抢走一颗也要他流血！”保卫自己生命的激烈斗争开始了。张从龙又威胁群众“凡是四十岁以下十六岁以上的人，都是民兵，统统杀死！”在这血腥屠杀之下，老百姓一批一批的逃亡流浪到更远的地方去。起先他们流亡到五里外的封村、石桥、南秦，但张从龙赶到石桥，又逃到十余里以外的三条沟等村子。可是一个庄稼人忘不了自己的土地的，每天早上偷偷的带上干粮回到自己的土地上去种地，不知被杀死了多少！西冯堡的银柱回去做庄稼，被他们用刺刀刺杀在地里，这些土地上流过他们的汗，又流尽了他们的血。到后来因为一天只能做四五小时的活，又加地里的草长得比庄稼还高，庄稼人着急了，全家下地。那时地干草多，天热人饥，他们一面拔草，一面落下泪来，他们叹息着：“几辈子作了孽，受这样大的罪？”后来又因为天热、人饥、活重，又犯了霍乱痢疾，好多人病了，好多人死了。他们见到一个民主政府的工作人员，或几个八路军，他们就哭诉着自己的痛苦，要军队快来救他们。他们已经不能等待，他们在受着饥饿、疾病、枪杀的迫害，他们有家归不得！！
