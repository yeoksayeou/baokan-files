    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. The Xi'an Zheng Bao reported on July 27th, citing a Nanjing air dispatch, that Yunnan Province Chairman Lu Han, in a conversation with visiting reporters, admitted that the Yunnan army "soldiers have been fighting away from home for a long time and feel very war-weary, so the Yunnan army in the Northeast misses their hometowns very much." When a reporter asked if "it is true that the Yunnan army has collectively requested to be discharged," Mr. Lu replied, "That did happen." According to a Shanghai special dispatch in the Chongqing Southwest Daily on July 27th, Lu Han himself is also "tired of military life and politics, and intends to retire to his hometown." The dispatch also stated that Shanghai "widely rumored that the Yunnan provincial government will be reorganized."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. Chongqing News: Since Chiang Kai-shek specially dispatched the special agent chief Tang Zong to Kunming to "hunt down the murderers" in the Wen Li blood case, local Yunnan figures, including Yang Lihua (also known as Lide), former adjutant of former Yunnan Province Chairman Long Yun, Zhang Minnian, former head of the provincial government's detective team, Wang Xigao, deputy head of the team, as well as middle and upper-level officers of the 24th Division of the Yunnan Army, and more than 100 students from the Southwestern Associated University remaining in Kunming, have been arrested and imprisoned in the Kuomintang Garrison Headquarters Special Prison (located at the foot of Taihua Mountain, where the number of "prisoners" has reached several thousand). It is reported that Kunming special agents are attempting to round up all local Yunnan figures.
