Chiang's 73rd Army, entrenched in the Zibo mining area, whose 193rd Division, after invading the Xihe coal mine, ten miles east of Boshan, then invaded Xipozhen, eight miles east of Xihe, attempting to build strongholds. The Eighth Route Army launched a defensive counter-attack on the 29th of last month, completely annihilating one battalion of the 577th Regiment of that division which had invaded the town, and recovered the town, capturing more than 60 prisoners, and seizing four artillery pieces and more than 80 rifles and machine guns. In addition, the remnants of the 22nd and 23rd Regiments of the 8th Division of Chiang’s 54th Army, which had invaded the Yilanzhuang station (25 miles west of Jiaoxian city) along the railway, after being attacked and heavily damaged by the Eighth Route Army on the 25th of last month, fled Zhilan. More than 1,000 of their remnants had sneaked into Jiaoxian city on the 29th. When the division fled in panic, an American-style Chiang Kai-shek plane flew to Zhilanzhuang Station for a low-altitude strafing, was hit by the Eighth Route Army, caught fire, and crashed in the southern suburbs of Jiaoxian city, and two pilots were burned to death.
