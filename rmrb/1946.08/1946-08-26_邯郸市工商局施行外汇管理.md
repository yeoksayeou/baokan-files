　　Handan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce
    Implements Foreign Exchange Control
    [Report from this newspaper, Handan] Since the establishment of the exchange, due to the actions of certain speculators, the prices of Customs Gold Units and legal tender have been rising continuously, affecting the interests of legitimate merchants. Therefore, on the 11th, the Handan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce implemented import/export and foreign exchange controls, stipulating that merchants engaged in import/export are not allowed to purchase foreign exchange. All Customs Gold Units and legal tender without import/export cargo lists from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and special currency carrying permits from the bank are considered illegal if traded privately in the market or carried without authorization. However, the currency trading prices at the exchange are not restricted and remain freely negotiable. This method, which benefits legitimate import/export merchants, leaves no opportunity for speculators to exploit. From the start of the controls until now, approximately the 20th, the exchange rate has rapidly declined. The legal tender has fallen from 415 Jichaopiao per 100 yuan to 300 yuan, the Customs Gold Unit has fallen from 825 yuan to 630 yuan, the silver dollar has fallen from 485 Jichaopiao per dollar to 400 yuan, and gold has fallen from 88,000 yuan to 81,000 yuan. And the downward trend continues. (Gong Xian)

　　邯郸市工商局
    施行外汇管理
    【本报邯郸讯】本市自交易所成立后，由于某些投机商人的作祟，致关金法币价格陆续上涨，影响正当商人的利益，本市工商局乃于十一日施行出入口及外汇管理，规定办理出入口之商人，不准购买外汇，一切无工商局出入口货单及银行特种货币携带证之关金法币，在市场上私自交易或擅行携带均属非法；但交易所之货币买卖价格，并不限制，仍由其自由成交。此种便利于正当出入口商人的办法，使投机商人完全无机可乘。从开始管理，到现在二十日左右，比价即迅速下跌。法币由每百元冀钞比四一五元下跌到三百元，关金由八二五元跌到六三○元，银元由每元比冀钞四八五元跌至四百元，金子由八万八千元下跌到八万一千元。且续有下跌之势。（贡贤）
