　　Stepped Up Anti-Smuggling Measures, Strict Prohibition of Grain, Cloth, and Other Exports
    Wu'an County Government Stabilizes Commodity Prices
    [Our Dispatch] In order to stabilize commodity prices, the Wu'an County Government has implemented various emergency measures. A notice was issued throughout the county strictly prohibiting the export of grain, cotton, and cloth, and restricting large-scale purchases. To this end, village militias have intensified anti-smuggling efforts. Of the 15 million yuan in commercial loans issued by the Jinnan Bank, 12 million yuan has been recovered. Publicly-owned and government agency stores have also released goods to regulate commodity prices.
    As a result, current commodity prices have gradually stabilized or fallen. Millet has fallen from 43 yuan to 32 yuan per jin, wheat has fallen from 47 yuan to 34 yuan, and white flour has fallen from 60 yuan to 50 yuan per jin (all prices per jin). Other commodities have also slightly decreased, with native cloth falling from 150 yuan to 120 yuan per chi. The government is currently holding a cooperative society meeting to conduct specific research on stabilizing and controlling future market prices. (Yifan)

　　加紧缉私严禁粮布等出口
    武安县府平抑物价
    【本报讯】武安县政府为平抑物价，曾施以各种紧急措施。通令全县严禁粮、棉、布出口，限制大批购货，各村民兵为此特加紧缉私。冀南银行发放之千五百万元商业贷款，已收回千二百万元；公营及机关商店均纷纷抛出物资，调剂物价。
    由此目前物价得渐趋平稳或下跌。小米每斤已由四十三元落至三十二，小麦由四十七元落至三十四元，白面六十元落至五十元（以上均以斤计）。其他百货均稍下落，土布每尺由百五十元已落至百二十元。现政府正召开合作社会议，对稳定与掌握今后市价，当有具体研究。（一帆）
