　　Actively Help Peasants to Overthrow Landlords
    Zhai Shixian Donates Most of His Land
    Wu'an County Party Committee Calls on Cadres to Be the First to Respond to This Action
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 30th] Zhai Shixian, a teacher at North China University, persuaded his family to donate part of their land, houses, clothing, and belongings to the village farmers' association, requesting that they be distributed to poor peasants in order to accelerate the implementation of the Chinese Communist Party's and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition of "land to the tillers." The donated property included more than 200 mu of land, more than 200 houses, and clothing and utensils worth several million yuan. Zhai's family is one of the three major landlords in Boyan Town, Wu'an County. He himself is a Communist Party member, a graduate of Waseda University in Japan, and formerly served as the propaganda section chief of the Taiyue Column of the Eighth Route Army. He is currently a teacher at North China University. In a letter to the Wu'an County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, he said: "In order to realize the great ideal of our Party of 'land to the tillers', I am willing to donate my land and houses to the hardworking peasants, so that every peasant in the liberated areas can quickly obtain the necessary conditions for production and accelerate the great leap forward of Chinese society." The Wu'an County Party Committee immediately replied with a warm welcome and called on cadres to be the first to respond to this action. The peasants of Boyan Town praised him in their conversations, saying, "He donated his land to help us to overthrow the landlords and gain liberation, he is truly worthy of being a Communist Party member."
