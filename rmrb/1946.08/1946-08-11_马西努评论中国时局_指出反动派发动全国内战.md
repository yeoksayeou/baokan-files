　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Commentator Massey of Moscow Radio commented on the Chinese situation today, pointing out that Chinese reactionaries have launched a nationwide civil war. He said: On August 2nd, the Kuomintang used eight planes obtained from the United States to bomb Yan'an. It is known that the bombs landed near the headquarters of General Zhu De, commander-in-chief of the People's Revolutionary Army, which was the target of the pilots' bombing.
    Chinese democrats point out that this move by the Kuomintang reactionaries attempts to shatter the Chinese people's hope of establishing peace and preventing civil war in various places. Massey listed facts to prove that this act was premeditated. He pointed out that in the days before the bombing of Yan'an, newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai spread news about the construction of new concentration camps and the implementation of peaceful control. In Shanghai, the state of emergency has been restored and activities against democratic newspapers have begun. In Nanjing, reactionary newspapers launched a frenzied campaign demanding the complete suppression of Communists throughout the country. Under these circumstances, Peng Xuepei, the Kuomintang Minister of Propaganda, directly declared in a speech on July 28th that the country is currently facing a long-term civil war, and the civil war is unfolding very rapidly. On July 30th, Ta Kung Pao reported that a meeting of generals was convened in Guling, attended by Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, and other military leaders. On August 1st, an order for air defense and light control in Nanjing was announced, but the next day (August 2nd), Kuomintang planes bombed Yan'an. Massey continued: Chinese democrats believe that this incident is a stage in the reactionary forces' widespread offensive against democratic forces.
    Now the Chinese reactionaries have ignited a nationwide civil war. Chinese democrats point out that this is not only a war against the Chinese Communist Party, but also a war against all democratic forces, against Sun Yat-sen's thought and Sun Yat-senism. Massey pointed out: Chinese democrats believe that the bombing of Yan'an and the expansion of the civil war are encouraged and aided by American reactionaries. Chinese democrats believe that the continued presence of U.S. troops in China can only be seen as directly helping the Chinese civil war by standing on the side of Chinese reaction. Massey finally quoted Soong Ching-ling's warning that the Kuomintang cannot win in such a war.

　　马西努评论中国时局  
    指出反动派发动全国内战
　　【新华社延安八日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努评论中国时局，指出中国反动分子已发动全国的内战。他说：八月二日国民党以从美国得到的八架飞机轰炸了延安，据悉炸弹落于人民革命军总司令朱德将军总部附近的地方，这就是飞行员轰炸的目标。
    中国民主人士指出，国民党反动分子此举企图打破中国人民想树立和平与阻止各地内战的希望。马西努列举事实证明这一勾当是预先准备了的。他指出在轰炸延安前几天，南京上海报纸传出关于建筑新的集中营，实施和平控制等消息，在上海已恢复了非常的情况，开始反对民主报纸的活动。在南京反动报纸展开疯狂的运动，要求完全压迫全国各地的共产党员。在这种情况下，国民党宣传部长彭学沛在七月二十八日的演说中，直接宣称目前是处在长期内战的前面，内战已非常迅速的展开了。七月三十日大公报传出在牯岭召集将领会议，有白崇禧、陈诚，及其他军事首领参加。八月一日公布在南京防空与灯火管制的命令，可是第二天（八月二日），国民党飞机就轰炸了延安。马氏继称：中国民主人士认为这个事件是反动势力向民主力量实行广泛的进攻的阶段。
    现在中国反动分子已燃烧起全国的内战，中国民主人士指出这不仅是反对中国共产党的战争，而且是反对一切的民主力量反对孙中山思想与孙中山主义的战争。马氏指出：中国民主人士认为轰炸延安与内战的扩大乃是美国反动派所鼓励与助长的。中国民主人士认为美军继续驻在中国，只能认为站在中国反动方面直接帮助中国内战。马氏最后引证宋庆龄的警告说：国民党在这种战争中，是不能取得胜利的。
