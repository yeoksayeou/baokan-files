　　Seventeenth Division All Officers and Soldiers Send Telegram to Comfort Mr. Li Furen
[This newspaper dispatch] All officers and soldiers of the Seventeenth Division were delighted to learn that Mr. Li Furen had escaped danger and arrived in Yan'an, and specially sent a telegram of condolences. The original telegram is as follows: To Mr. Li Furen, transferred through the New China News Agency:
　　In mid-May, we were shocked to hear that you, sir, were kidnapped by Kuomintang secret agents in broad daylight in Xi'an and taken to Xianyang to be murdered. For a time, the entire army was filled with indignation and hometown sentiments arose spontaneously. For twenty years, you, sir, have struggled arduously for the democratic education cause of the Northwest people, but unexpectedly suffered such a tragic end. In late July, upon reading the Yan'an telegram, we were pleasantly surprised that you, sir, were not killed by the secret agents, but escaped danger and arrived in Yan'an. The entire army was delighted and celebrated your rebirth, and celebrated the rebirth of our Northwest people's democratic fighter.
　　We deeply consider your persecution, which, as you, sir, stated at the Yan'an memorial meeting for Comrades Li and Wen, was a political assassination organized and planned by Kuomintang secret agents. However, the Kuomintang reactionary group did not achieve its goal. The democratic direction that you, sir, have been striving for is precisely the truth supported by the people of the whole country. Therefore, behind you, sir, not only do we support you, but there are also thousands upon thousands of people backing you. We pledge to make our utmost efforts to encourage and advance together with you, sir, to promote the heroic revolutionary tradition of our Northwest people, and to fight to the end for the realization of independence, peace, and democracy for the people of the whole country.
　　The feelings of our hometown are difficult to express fully in words. We wish to specially comfort you, sir, and pray that you take good care of yourself!
　　Zhang Fuzhen, Liu Weicheng, Liang Lisheng, and all officers and soldiers of the Seventeenth Division,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　July 29th

　　十七师全体官兵电慰李敷仁先生
    【本报讯】十七师全体官兵欣闻李敷仁先生脱险莅延，顷特致电慰问，原电如下：新华通讯社转李敷仁先生：
    五月中旬惊闻先生在西安被国民党特务大天白日劫赴咸阳杀害，一时全军愤怒填膺，乡情油然。先生二十年来为西北人民民主教育事业坚苦奋斗，不意竟遭到了如此凄惨的下场。七月下旬，读延安电，惊喜先生被特务杀害未死，脱险到延，全军欣奋，庆祝先生重生，庆祝我们西北人民的民主战士重生。
    我们深思先生的被害，确如先生在延安追悼李闻二氏大会所讲，是国民党特务有组织有计划的政治暗杀，但国民党反动集团却没达到他的目的。先生所努力的民主方向，正是全国人民拥护的真理，因此在先生的背后不但有我们支援，并且有千千万万的人民为先生作后盾，我们誓愿以最大的努力与先生共励共进，发挥我西北人民英勇革命传统，为全国人民的独立和平民主实现奋斗到底。
    曲衷乡情，实难一一言尽，愿特告慰先生，祈多保重！
    张复振刘威诚梁励生暨十七师全体官兵上
                                        七月二十九日
