　　Following the victorious unfolding of the self-defense counter-attack on the Longhai Railway line, the people of the Southwestern Shandong Liberated Area have launched an enthusiastic movement to support the troops. On the evening of August 15th, the Cao County Frontline慰问队(comforting team) , led by Comrade Wang Shaojiang, Propaganda Section Chief of the Political Department of the Fifth Sub-district, and Li Heting, principal of Cao County Complete Primary School, a group of eighteen people went to the front line to comfort the troops. They carried thirty-seven carts, fully loaded with fat pigs, sheep, chickens, eggs, biscuits, pickles, and all kinds of慰劳品(comforting goods). Qibin County alone慰劳(consoled) the troops with one thousand and eighty-seven watermelons and ten fat pigs. When they亲切(cordially) delivered the慰劳品(comforting goods) to the soldiers, and read them all kinds of small tunes that encouraged morale and letters of慰问(condolences) from the broad masses of the people, the wounded forgot their pain and happily said, "It is truly glorious to be wounded for the people, it is worth dying for."
　　
    【本报荷泽讯】(Report from our newspaper in Heze) After the liberation of Minquan Station, order was quickly restored near the station. The Kuomintang's 55th Brigade's proclamation strictly prohibiting passage through the railway was torn to shreds, and slogans such as "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's Dictatorial and Traitorous Country and Fight the Civil War" appeared on the walls. Children enthusiastically helped the battlefield work team post the CCP Central Committee's "July 7th" Declaration. Many people voluntarily acted as guides for our army and staff, and handed over bullets left behind by the Chiang army. Vendors, road workers, and women rushed to stuff watermelons, cigarettes, and other慰劳品(comforting goods) into the hands of the comrades of the work team, and said enthusiastically, "We have been looking forward to you for a long time, you have finally arrived." An old lady said, "The Chiang army is even worse than the Japanese, if you hadn't come, we wouldn't have been able to survive." When the work team rescued six thousand 石(dàn, unit of dry measure for grain) of wheat and sorghum that the Kuomintang's 74th Brigade had forcibly requisitioned from various villages and hid in warehouses to provide relief to the poor, they all shed tears of gratitude. Gao Xingzhou, who used to be an officer in the Northeast Army and later became a refugee, said happily, "When I was in Kaifeng, I didn't receive even half a 两(Liang, traditional Chinese unit of weight) of all that relief flour. Now that the Eighth Route Army has come, my family of three has received two and a half 斗(dǒu, unit of dry measure) each." An office has now been established at Minquan Station to handle various after-care tasks. The masses are excitedly spreading the victorious news of our army's liberation of Lanfeng, Liuheji, Yejigang and other places, and are inquiring about the battle situation of our army's counterattack on Minquan City amidst the sound of artillery fire. They all said in unison, "What American weapons, they can't stand up to the Eighth Route Army."

　　陇海前线自卫获胜
    鲁西南群众热烈劳军
    民权车站附近迅速恢复秩序
    【本报荷泽讯】自从陇海线自卫反击战胜利展开后，鲁西南解放区的人民掀起热烈的劳军运动。八月十五日晚，曹县前线慰劳队在五分区政治部宣教科长王少江同志及曹县完小校长李和亭的率领下，一行十八人赴前线劳军。他们携带大车三十七辆，满装肥猪、羊、鸡、鸡蛋、饼干、酱菜等各种各样应有尽有的慰劳品。仅齐滨一县，即慰劳西瓜一千零八十七个，肥猪十口。当他们把慰劳品亲切的送到战士们手里，把各种各样鼓励士气的小调及广大人民的慰问信，读给他们听时，伤员们都忘掉了伤痛，而高兴地说：“为人民负伤真光荣，死了也值得。”
    【本报荷泽讯】民权车站解放后，车站附近迅速恢复秩序。国民党五五旅严禁通过铁路的布告被撕碎了，墙头上出现了“反对蒋介石独裁卖国打内战”的标语儿童们热烈的帮助战地工作队张贴中共中央“七七”宣言。许多人自动为我军及工作人员做向导，并交出蒋军遗留下的子弹。小贩、路工和妇女们纷纷跑来，把西瓜、纸烟等慰劳品，塞进工作队同志们的手中，且热情的说：“我们早就盼着你们，你们总算来了。”一个老太太说：“蒋军简直比日本人还厉害，你们再不来，我们就活不下去了。”当工作队把国民党七四旅从各村强迫征来藏在仓库中的麦子和高粱六千石救济贫民时，他们都感激的流着眼泪。一位过去曾任东北军军官，后来成为难民的高兴周说：“在开封时，那么多救济面没有给过我半两。这会八路军来，我一家三口，每人就领了二斗半。”现民权车站已成立了办事处，处理各种善后工作。群众兴奋的传播着我军解放兰封、柳河集、野鸡岗等地的胜利消息，并在炮火声中探询我军反击民权城的战况。他们异口同声的说：“什么美国武器遇见八路军也就吃不开了。”
