　　Resolutely Defending the Border Region, 30,000 Young and Strong Men Voluntarily Enlisted
[Our Newspaper Heze, 18th Dispatch] The people's armed forces in our Eastern Henan District have recently cooperated with our counter-offensive operations along the Lanfeng, Minquan, Dangshan, and Qi County lines, actively carrying out guerrilla warfare. On the night of the 11th, they attacked the Southern Gate of Kaifeng and the airport, the center of Liu Zhi's civil war command, capturing more than ten defending soldiers. The whole city of Kaifeng was shaken and placed under emergency curfew. On the night of the 13th, they also occupied Zhuxian Town, an important town more than 30 miles south of Kaifeng, capturing two Chiang soldiers, wounding three, and seizing five rifles, with no casualties on our side. On the same day, our armed work team captured more than ten advancing cars and horse-drawn carts on the Kaifeng-Zhuxian Town road, seizing a large amount of supplies. The Chiang troops are panic-stricken by the elusive and surprise attacks of our guerrillas and militiamen.
[Our Newspaper Handan, 19th Dispatch] Young and strong men in the border region have voluntarily enlisted in the army and rushed to the front lines to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. In the past ten days, the Ji-Lu-Yu area has reached more than 20,000 people, while the Taihang area has reached 12,000 people.
　　Since the anti-civil war conference was held in Yuncheng, Ji-Lu-Yu, the masses have automatically launched a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army. In Xiao and Liang Zhuang alone, 11 model squad members collectively enlisted in the army. 183 demobilized soldiers in Junan County returned to the front line. In Yutai County's Chengguan District, after hearing the news of the Chiang troops' offensive against the border region, 12 young people enlisted and 17 soldiers returned to their units within half a day. 3,000 people in the whole district formed teams to send off the new soldiers. Bu Xianhui's father said when he sent his son to the front line: "We only turned ourselves around since the Communist Party came. Chiang Kai-shek wants to come and fight again, we have to fight him to the death." Young woman Wei Yulian said: "If the government calls, I will also take a gun to the front." Mr. Zhou, from Li Tang Village, Haozhai District, Peixian County, sent his eldest son to the Old Ninth Regiment on the first day that the Chiang troops began their offensive against the Eastern Henan District, and after the victory of the Longhai Campaign, he sent his second son to the main force. When Yang Xianting sent his son to join the army, he said: "Fight to the end, don't come home until you defeat the reactionaries." The chairman of the Farmers' Association of Wanglou, the village head of Liwa House, and the militia captain of Xuge all led the masses to join the army.
　　In Wu'an Chengguan, 47 heroes signed up for the army in two days. Li Heixiao and Yin Renxiao, Communist Party members in Neiqiu, took the lead in signing up and led 288 people to join the People's Liberation Army. In Changzhi, 120 people signed up in the first district and more than 300 people signed up in the third district in two days. Mothers sending off their sons, wives sending off their husbands, lanterns and decorations everywhere, celebrating and sending off the brave men who voluntarily enlisted in the army.
