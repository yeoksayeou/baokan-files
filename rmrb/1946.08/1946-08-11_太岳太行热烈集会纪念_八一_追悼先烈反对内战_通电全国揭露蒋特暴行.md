　　[This newspaper Yangcheng news] On the afternoon of the 3rd, over 2,000 people from all walks of life in Taiyue gathered in Yangcheng to mourn Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, as well as the comrades who sacrificed themselves in the direct organs over the past year. Director Niu solemnly narrated the life and death of the martyred comrades, pointing out that they all sacrificed themselves for the independence, peace, and democracy of the country. Comrade Gui Shaobin, representative of the District Party Committee, said: "Chiang Kai-shek is launching a nationwide civil war. In addition to military offensives, he is also stepping up his secret service policies. Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were shot to death in broad daylight by armed secret agents. Our comrades from the Administrative Office Cadre School, Zhang Yaobu and others, were assassinated by secret agents while leading the masses to stand up. We must avenge these martyred comrades." Deputy Commander Sun said with great grief and indignation: "Today is a memorial service, and also a rally against civil war and against secret agents. These forty-one comrades sacrificed themselves for the people. Some are Communist Party members, and some, though not Communist Party members, are also good students of Chairman Mao and good children of the people. They did their best and sacrificed themselves for the people. We resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's secret service policy and eliminate armed secret agents." Mr. Gao Yanliu, an old gentleman from the Henan Democratic National Construction Association, shouted with grief and indignation: "The sacrifice of these martyrs was caused by secret agents. Under Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, even a professor, writer, or scholar cannot survive. His brutality exceeds that of the worst tyrants in history, and it is a collection of all the abuses and atrocities of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. However, Chiang Kai-shek's arrogance is just a dying struggle, outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Relying on the assistance of his foreign ancestors to attack the people of all of China will surely be submerged by the democratic tide of the world." Yangcheng Councilor Wang Yuan said with a simple peasant demeanor and in a solemn voice: "Chiang Kai-shek wants to harm the country and the people and sell out the country. This is impossible. Because our farmers have been mobilized and united, and this is an invincible force forever." Mr. Zhang Wenxuan, a family member of a martyr, said very sadly: "My child, Zhang Zhanyun, was a student at the Administrative Office Cadre School. He went to Jiang County to mobilize the masses and was surrounded by armed secret agents at night. His hand was cut three times, but he did not throw away the gun he was carrying, but fought desperately with the secret agents until he was killed. It is glorious to die for the people, and everyone will avenge him." The conference also telegraphed the whole country, opposing civil war and opposing secret agents, stating:
　　Our Taiyue Liberated Area is one of the front lines of the civil war, and also an area where Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's secret agents are rampant. Since the beginning of July, 20,000 Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan troops have frantically attacked our Southern Fen Liberated Area, occupying Wenxi City and more than 400 large and small villages and towns within ten days. Wherever the iron hooves go, houses are turned into ruins. And the activities of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan secret agents and bandits are even more ubiquitous, poisoning and assassinating, doing everything possible to inflict human misery. In the Wufujian tragedy in Yuanqu, 57 militiamen died at one time, and recently a shocking incident of poisoning by secret agents occurred in Jiyuan, with more than 300 people poisoned at one time, and more than 40 people died without rescue. What crime have the people committed to suffer such poisonous hands? This is tolerable, what is intolerable? The telegram continued: The people of our Taiyue District deeply know from their own experience that only self-defense and only struggle can protect the lives of the people and protect China's independence, peace, and democracy.
　　[This newspaper Changzhi news] Over a thousand cadres from the Taihang Military Region and the same level of Party, government, military, and civilian organs held a "Commemoration of August 1st, Mourning Martyrs, Anti-Civil War, and Anti-Secret Agent Rally" on August 1st. The meeting place was decorated with huge banners that read "Commemorate the Birthday of the Eighth Route Army and Always Maintain the Glorious Tradition of the People's Army" and "To Live for the People and Die for the People is the True Color of a Hero, Forever Immortal." At the beginning of the meeting, everyone bowed to pay tribute to Comrades Guan Xiangying and Luo Binghui, who died for the cause of people's democracy, and Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo. Director Yuan Ziqin of the Military Region's Political Department pointed out in his speech: Our troops still have remnants of warlordism. Comrades in the troops should pay special attention to overcoming this bad style. Party, government, and civilian comrades should provide more help and supervision to the troops. He called on everyone to learn from the spirit of Comrades Guan and Luo, who were loyal to the Party and the country and wholeheartedly served the people. Political Commissar Li Xuefeng took the stage amidst applause. After elaborating on the experience of building the army, he called on everyone to cherish the masses, help the masses to stand up, and guard against arrogance and impatience to unite well, defeat the attacks of the Kuomintang fascists, and fight for the independence, peace, and democracy of the whole country.

　　太岳太行热烈集会纪念“八一”            
    追悼先烈反对内战 
    通电全国揭露蒋特暴行
    【本报阳城讯】三日下午，太岳各界二千余人在阳城集会，追悼李公朴、闻一多先生暨直属机关一年来牺牲的同志。牛主任首先沉痛叙述了死难烈士的生平和遇害的经过，指出他们都是为求国家之独立、和平、民主而牺牲的。区党委代表桂绍彬同志说：“蒋介石正在发动全国规模的内战，他除了军事进攻外，又加紧特务政策，李、闻二先生是在光天化日下被武装特务用乱枪打死的。我们行署干校张耀步等同志，是在领导群众翻身时被特务暗杀的。我们要为这些死难烈士复仇”。孙副司令员满怀悲愤的说：“今天是追悼会，同时也是反内战反特务大会。我们这四十一位同志是为人民牺牲的，有的是共产党员，有的虽不是共产党员，也是毛主席的好学生，人民的好子弟。他们鞠躬尽瘁，为人民牺牲了，我们坚决反对蒋介石的特务政策，消灭武装特务。”河南民主建国协会高延柳老先生发出了悲愤的喊声：“这些烈士的牺牲是被特务打死的，在蒋介石的专政下，就是一个教授文人学者也无法生存，其残暴超过历史上最坏的暴君，集古今中外虐政暴行之大成，但是蒋介石这样横行霸道不过是没落的挣扎，外强中干。仗凭他洋祖宗的援助来向全中国的人民开刀，必为世界的民主潮流所淹没。”阳城参议员王源以朴实的农民姿态，悲壮地说：“蒋介石要祸国殃民，出卖国家，这是办不到的。因为我们农民已经发动起来了，团结起来了，这便是永远打不垮的力量”。烈士家属张文选老先生很沉痛的说：“我的孩子张占云是行署干校的学生，到绛县发动群众，晚上被武装特务包围，手上被砍了三刀，但他没有把他带的枪扔了，还是和特务拚命，最后才被杀了。为人民而死是光荣的，大家会给他报仇的。”大会并通电全国，反对内战、反对特务，略称：
    我太岳解放区是内战前线之一，也是蒋阎特务逞凶活动的一个地区，自七月初开始，蒋阎军两万之众疯狂向我汾南解放区进攻，十日之内占我闻喜城及大小村镇四百余处，铁蹄所至，庐舍为墟。而蒋阎特务土匪的活动更无孔不入，放毒暗杀。极尽人间之惨毒。垣曲五福涧惨案一次死民兵五十七人，而最近济源更发生特务放毒的惊人事件，一次中毒者三百余人，四十余人不救而死，人民何辜遭此毒手？此而可忍，孰不可忍？继称：我太岳区人民从切身经历中，深知只有自卫、只有奋斗、才能保卫人民的生命，保卫中国的独立和平与民主。
    【本报长治讯】太行军区暨同级党政军民机关干部千余人，于八月一日举行“纪念八一追悼先烈反内战反特务大会”。会场张挂“纪念八路军生日始终保持人民军队光荣传统”、“为人民而生，为人民而死，是英雄本色，永垂不朽”的巨幅标语。会议开始，首向为人民民主事业而死的关向应、罗炳辉二同志，李公朴、闻一多两先生鞠躬致哀。军区政治部袁主任子钦讲话时指出：我区部队目前还有着军阀主义作风的残余，部队同志要特别注意克服此种不良的作风，党政民同志要更多帮助监督部队。他号召大家学习关罗二同志忠心党国、全心全意为人民服务的精神。李政委雪峰在掌声中登台讲话，在详述建军经验之后，他号召爱护群众，帮助群众翻身，并戒骄戒燥好好团结，击退国民党法西斯派的进攻，为全国的独立和平民主而奋斗。
