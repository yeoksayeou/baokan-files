　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 5th. During the recent Suzhong Self-Defense War, there were many heroic and moving deeds that demonstrated the high degree of mutual love and self-sacrifice among the military and civilians in the liberated areas. One day, on the southern front of Rugao, when two Chiang Kai-shek planes suddenly emerged from the clouds, their sharp engines roaring overhead, Wang Debiao, a soldier of a certain New Fourth Army unit, quickly directed the masses to take cover. A logistics team member lay down on the nearby low ground. Wang Debiao plucked a large handful of weeds to cover him up as camouflage, and repeatedly advised him not to be afraid. However, Wang Debiao himself did not have time to hide and was shot and killed. After the planes flew away, the logistics team member climbed up from the low ground and saw that Wang had fallen in a pool of blood. He threw himself on Wang's body, wanting to cry out loud, but at that moment, the Chiang Kai-shek planes flew back again. Forgetting the danger, he carried Wang Debiao's bloody remains on his back and took them to the rear in one breath.

　　王得标舍己救人            
    后勤队员冒险抢尸
    【新华社淮阴五日电】此次苏中自卫战争中，有许多英勇壮烈的事例，表现了解放区军民互救舍己为人的高度友爱精神。有一天，在如皋南部前线，当两架蒋机突然从云隙中发出来马达尖利的在头顶上震响时，新四军某部战士王得标敏捷地指挥群众隐蔽。一个后勤队员卧倒在附近的低地上，王得标扯了一大把杂草盖在他身上伪装起来，并且频频相劝不要害怕；但是王得标自己却来不及隐蔽了，被扫射中弹而死。飞机飞远了，那个后勤队员从低地爬起来，看见王已倒卧在血泊中，他纵身扑上去，抱着王的尸体，正想放声大哭，这时蒋机又飞来了，他忘记了危险，背起王得标血淋淋的遗体一口气送到了后方。
