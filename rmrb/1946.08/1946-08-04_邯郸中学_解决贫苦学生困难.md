　　Handan Middle School
    Solves Difficulties for Impoverished Students
    [Our Dispatch] To solve the difficulties of impoverished students, Handan Middle School allows impoverished students to work as laborers during school building construction. They can earn ten catties of rice in wages per day, and the working time for each person cannot exceed three days. This method has solved the food expenses problem for twenty-five students, totaling more than 1,200 catties of rice. Working as a laborer for three days can solve two-thirds of the monthly food expenses. Missed classes are made up on Sundays, and the labor concept is strengthened, playing a leading role among the workers. Worker representative Old Li said: "The students are really active! They are much better than the outside laborers!" Students who had dropped out of school due to difficulties all wanted to return to school after hearing about this method.

　　邯郸中学
    解决贫苦学生困难
    【本报讯】邯中为解决贫苦学生困难，在校舍修建中让贫苦的学生作小工，每天可得工资米十斤，作工时间每人不能超过三日。用这个办法共解决了二十五名学生的膳费问题，共得米一千二百多斤。作三天的小工，就可解决每月三分之二的伙食费，缺课利用星期日补上，且加强了劳动观念，在工人当中起了带头作用。工人代表老李说：“学生们干的真积极呀！比外面小工干的强得多！”因困难已经退学的学生，一听说这个办法，都想复学。
