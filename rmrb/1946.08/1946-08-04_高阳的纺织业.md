　　Gaoyang's Textile Industry
    Chu Yuan
    The nationally renowned Gaoyang textile industry has revived from its difficulties amidst the wave of peaceful construction by the people of central Hebei. Walking through each village, one hears the clatter of looms. Cloth, thread, and cotton ceaselessly flow from the countryside towards the towns. Large groups of bicycles whiz by from the fields – these are the mobile merchants selling cloth. Even more numerous are the elderly and young women, wearing indigo-dyed Gaoyang cloth, carrying baskets to the market to sell their products. Approaching the suburbs, one sees many large chimneys emitting black smoke. Factory whistles sound constantly, and the roar of motors and machines can be faintly heard from afar. Since leaving Zhangjiakou, we have once again witnessed the unique prosperity of a liberated area city.

    The recovery and development of Gaoyang's textile industry in the six to seven months since liberation has exceeded ten times that of the enemy-occupied period, and the prosperity of the markets has surpassed even that. According to the county Federation of Industry and Commerce, less than one hundred bolts of cloth and three to four hundred jin of thread were traded at each market in Gaoyang city during the enemy occupation. However, by late April, each market traded eight to ten thousand bolts of cloth and over twelve thousand jin of thread. The number of people trading at the large market held every five days was over twenty thousand. Currently, there are more than thirty markets scattered in various townships throughout the county, with five or six markets operating every day. The largest commodity is the wide Gaoyang cloth, actively sold by mobile merchants to various towns and cities in the central Hebei, southern Hebei, western Hebei, Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan liberated areas.

    The prosperity of the markets demonstrates the rapid development of rural handicrafts. According to materials from the Farmers' Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, in late April, over seventy percent of the county's 108 villages saw most farmers and women participating extensively in mutual aid groups and cooperatives for spinning, weaving, and selling cloth. They have been universally organized in the integration of agricultural production and textile marketing. Already, twenty thousand women are engaged in spinning, each spinning one jin of thread every five days, producing 120,000 jin of thread per month. The number of looms has doubled from three thousand after liberation to six thousand, and the number of weavers has reached over eighteen thousand. They weave three thousand bolts of "foreign warp and native weft" (native thread) wide cloth, eighty feet long, per day, producing ninety thousand bolts per month. Currently, with Gaoyang as the center, extending to Qingyuan, Li County, Renqiu, Anxin, and other neighboring areas, a vast rural textile boom has swept across the area, with every household spinning and every village weaving, forming the largest textile center on the central Hebei plain.

    During the period of Japanese occupation, cotton became a military supply. Of the county's sixty thousand looms, some were destroyed and others were seized, leaving only three thousand. Besides weaving for the "combination" in the city, no one in the countryside wove cloth anymore. The people lost their source of wealth and lived the most difficult lives. It wasn't until liberation last year that both people and machines came back to life. To recover the vitality lost in eight years, the village chief of Weijiazhuang Village, fifteen li east of Gaoyang city, told us that his village had sixty machines before the war of resistance. After eight years of Japanese occupation, only two remained. After liberation, three more were added, and this April, the number had increased to nine. Now they are organized to buy twenty more, and they plan to strive to restore the pre-war level by the end of this year.

    Before the war of resistance, Gaoyang's textile industry was once extremely prosperous. During its peak in the sixth and seventh years of the Republic of China (1917-1918), it had sixty thousand iron looms and fourteen modern machine dyeing and rolling factories, producing 1.7 million bolts annually, which were sold in Gansu, Suiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, the Northeast, Shanxi, Henan, and major cities in China. Hong Kong, Yangon, and Singapore also saw its presence. However, its development was extremely incomplete. As a result of the enemy's rule, the supply of yarn completely depended on enemy yarn factories in Shanghai and Tianjin. The production of cloth came from farmers' household handicrafts, while the machine production in factories was only the processing part of bleaching, rolling, dyeing, and calendering the finished products. Farmers grew cotton only to produce raw materials for Japanese yarn factories. They had to rely on enemy yarn factories for the thread they used to weave cloth themselves. They engaged in individual, backward manual production in their earthen houses and had actually become the cheapest labor force scattered in the Chinese countryside by Japanese imperialism, sharing the same fate as the workers concentrated in the factories. Industrial capitalists were squeezed and suppressed and could not control the entire production process, only grasping at the tail end and competing for profits from the cloth woven by the farmers. For decades, they had not shaken off their status as economic vassals of Japan. In 1927, with the rise of Japanese rayon, Gaoyang cotton products plummeted, and farmers reorganized over seventy percent of their business to produce hemp and silk products to eke out a living. In 1937-38, with the large-scale dumping of Japanese silk fabrics, Gaoyang's textile industry was once again severely hit, and many large cloth and thread shops closed down. With the fall of Gaoyang city after the war of resistance, it died a complete death.

    However, today, although the Gaoyang textile industry rebuilt by the people themselves is still far from the pre-war level, it has undergone fundamental changes. The shackles of imperialist economic constraints have been completely shattered, and feudal exploitation after rent and interest reduction has also been greatly weakened. The productive forces of farmers have been organized and are developing forward at an unprecedented speed, which is the main reason for the rapid development of handicrafts today. A large number of handcrafted products have poured out of the countryside. They need dyeing and processing, and merchants are needed to promote sales. Because the hand-spun thread cannot keep up with the needs of weaving, they still rely on the import of more than half of the foreign yarn from Tianjin and Beijing. They not only need capital and looms, but also spinning machines, and need technical guidance and improvement. Here, it provides the most favorable political and economic conditions for industrial and commercial capitalists to develop their enterprises.

    We visited the relatively large private Heji Electric Dyeing and Rolling Factory, which was one of the first to start operations after liberation and has therefore profited greatly. Manager Mr. Zhang Xiangting was hired as a county councilor. He described the current business situation, saying: in April, they could dye five hundred bolts and roll three hundred bolts of cloth per market (five days). The charge for dyeing one bolt is three thousand yuan, and the charge for rolling one bolt is three hundred yuan, totaling an income of 1.59 million yuan. After deducting labor, coal, and pigment costs of 600,000 yuan, the net profit is over 980,000 yuan. Manager Zhang announced in January that he wanted to make a profit of six million yuan this year, and the income from the current four months has already completed this plan. Therefore, he said happily: "Making money is a small matter. I am willing to work together with the democratic government to develop Gaoyang's textile industry."

    Here, there is no monopoly of bureaucratic capital to compete with the people for profits. For factories that were severely damaged by the Japanese invaders and unable to resume operations, the democratic government supported them with huge loans. The Jizhong Bank specially allocated 11 million yuan, of which 7 million has been loaned out, to reward private management, but also promoted public-private joint ventures. Hongji Dyeing and Rolling Factory, Yuanfeng Flour Company, Sanyi Electric Light Company, and Tonghe Dyeing and Pressing Factory are all partnerships between private capitalists and the democratic government. Because of the eight years of loss, their vitality was greatly damaged, and private capital was difficult to operate independently. However, the democratic government still aimed to support private development of industry and commerce. Manager Chen of Hongji Dyeing and Rolling Factory cooperated with the Seventh Military Sub-district and was very satisfied with the 20 percent dividend on machinery: "The public sector is needed to help with the eight years of losses. The public sector is really not working with us to make money, but to develop the people's cause."

    Due to the support of the democratic government and the favorable economic conditions in the liberated area, industry and commerce in Gaoyang city are booming. Heji, Enji, Tonghe, and Hongji, the four large dyeing and rolling factories, have already started operations. Yuanfeng's flour mill has produced flour. Sanyi Electric Light Company has installed bright electric lights throughout the city. Fifteen small weaving factories, such as Democratic, Happiness, and Tongju, have sprung up. In April, the number of printing factories increased sharply from one or two to ten. Nine handicraft dyeing shops have resumed operations. Thirty-one shops operating in the cloth business have also opened. Surrounding the development of the textile industry, more than one hundred shops and stalls, workshops of various industries such as daily necessities, food, drink, bicycles, iron shops, and pharmacies, have obtained development opportunities in this emerging city that they have not had in the past eight years.

    However, urban industry and commerce are still not catching up with the development of markets and handicrafts, mainly because they are affected by the Kuomintang's destruction of peaceful transportation and freedom of trade. Merchants buying cloth from Beiping and Tianjin were unreasonably detained and confiscated, and the transportation of cloth on trains was prohibited. Heavy taxes were levied on machinery and foreign yarn imported into our area, and their value was increased without limit, imposing a strict blockade on us. All these measures will actually further drive the people of Beiping and Tianjin, who urgently expect the assistance of materials from the liberated areas, to a more painful and impoverished life. Today, the people of the liberated areas have unanimously risen up and poured into peaceful construction. They have the confidence to overcome the new difficulties given by the reactionaries, and they are determined to persist in the struggle for defending the liberated areas and building the liberated areas until complete victory.

　　高阳的纺织业
    初原
    驰名全国的高阳纺织业，在冀中人民和平建设的浪潮中，已从艰难中复兴了。走过每一个村庄，都听到轧轧的织布机声，从四乡通往城镇的路上，布、线、棉花络绎不绝的向集市拥进。大群的自行车从田野里疾驰而过，那是推销布匹的流动商人，更有许许多多年老和年青的妇女，穿着阴丹士林色的高阳布，提着篮子赶集，出卖她们的生产品。一到城郊，就可见到好多大烟囱冒着黑烟，工厂的汽笛，不断叫着，马达和机器的轰鸣声更远远的隐约可闻。从离开张家口以后，我们又一次看到解放区城市及特有的繁荣气象了。
    高阳纺织业从解放后六、七个月的恢复发展，已超过敌占期间十倍以上，集市的繁荣超过更远，据县工商联合会谈：高阳城内敌占时每集上布不到一百匹，上线三、四百斤，而在四月下旬每集上布已达八千到一万匹，上线一万二千余斤，每五天一大集的交易人数，均在两万以上，目前全县分散在各乡镇共有三十多个集市，每天总有五、六个集。最大宗的物品，就是宽面的高阳布，经过活跃的流动商人推销于冀中、冀南、冀西、张家口、承德、热、察、绥解放区各大小城镇。
    集市的繁荣，表现了农村手工业的飞速发展，根据农会与工商联合会的材料，全县一○八个村庄中，在四月下旬已有百分之七十以上的村庄，大部分的农民与妇女都普遍的参加了纺线、织布和卖布的互助组与合作社。在农业生产与纺织运销结合中已普遍的组织起来了，已有两万妇女投入纺织，每人五天纺出一斤线，一月出线十二万斤。织布机解放后三千张，现已六千张，剧增一倍，织布人数已到一万八千以上，每天织成“经洋纬柴”（柴即土线）八十尺长的宽面布三千匹，月产九万匹。目前以高阳为中心，推及清苑，蠡县、任邱、安新等邻边地区，广大农村已卷入纺织热潮中，家家纺线，村村织布，形成了冀中平原上规模最大的纺织中心。
    日寇统治时期，棉花成了军用品，全县六万张织布机毁的毁抢的抢，只剩下三千张了，除了城内替“组合”织布外，乡村里再没人织布了，人民失掉了富源，过着最苦的日子，直到去年解放以后人和机子都复活起来，要恢复八年损失的元气，高阳城东十五里魏家庄村长告诉我们说：抗战前他村里有六十张机子，鬼子占了八年只剩下两张了，解放后增加了三张，今年四月已增至九张，现在又组织起来买二十张，计划今年底争取恢复战前水平。
    抗战前高阳纺织业曾盛极一时，民国六、七年鼎盛时代，拥有铁机六万张，近代机器染轧工厂十四家，年产一百七十万匹，畅销于甘肃、绥远、张家口、外蒙、新疆、东北、山西、河南及国内各大城市；香港、仰光、新嘉坡亦有其踪迹。但是，它的发展，是异常残缺不全的，敌寇统治的结果，线纱的供给，完全依赖于沪、津敌人纱厂，布的生产则出于农民家庭手工业，而工厂的机器生产，仅是织成品的漂白、轧宽、染色、轧光等加工部分；农民种植棉花，只是为了东洋纱厂生产原料，自己织布用线，反求敌人纱厂供给，他们坐在土屋里进行个人落后的手工生产，实际上已变成日本帝国主义分散在中国农村中最廉价的劳动力，和集中在工厂里的工人是同样命运的。工业资本家们受到排挤和打击，不能掌握全部生产过程，只是抓住了一条尾巴，从农民织成的布匹上争求利润，数十年来他们没有摆脱掉日寇经济上的附庸地位，民国十六年，日本人造丝兴起，高阳棉品一落千丈，农民遂改组百分之七十以上的麻丝品，以苟延挣扎，民国二十六、七年日寇丝织品大倾销，高阳纺织业又一次被惨重打击，许多大布线庄纷纷倒闭，抗战后随着高阳城的陷落，也就一命鸣呼了。
    可是今天为人民亲手重建的高阳纺织业虽离战前水平相距尚远，但在根本上已起了新的变化，帝国主义经济束缚的枷锁，已被彻底粉碎，减租减息后封建剥削也大大剥弱，农民生产力已组织起来，并以空前未有的速度向前发展，这就是目前手工业飞速发展的主要原因。大量的手工生产品从农村中涌出来了，它们需要染色加工，需要商人推销，因为手工纺线赶不上织布的需要，仍依赖平、津输入一半以上的洋纱，他们不但需要资本和织布机，更需要纺纱机，需要技术上指导和改进，在这里，它给工商业资本家准备下了发展企业最有利的政治和经济条件。
    我们参观此间规模较大的私营合记电力染轧工厂，它是解放后开工最早的一个，因此获利很大，经理张香亭先生被聘为县议员，他述及目前营业情况说：四月份每集（五天）已能染五百匹，轧三百匹布，染一匹收费三千元，轧一匹三百元。共收入一百五十九万元，除了人力、煤、颜料成本消耗六十万元外，可获净利九十八万余元，张经理在一月份曾宣布今年要求获利六百万元，仅目前四个月的收入，已经完成这个计划了。因此他很高兴的说：“挣钱还是小事，愿与民主政府共同努力，发展高阳纺织业”。
    这里没有官僚资本的垄断，来与民争利，对于被日寇破坏很重无力复业的工厂，民主政府以巨大贷款扶植之，冀中银行特拨一千一百万元，现已贷下七百万，奖励私人经营，但也提倡公私合营。鸿记染轧工厂，元丰面粉公司，三益电灯公司，同合染压工厂均系私人资本家与民主政府合作，因为八年的损失，元气大伤，私人资本很难独力经营，但是民主政府仍以扶植私人发展工商业为目的。鸿记染轧工厂陈经理与七分区合作，他对机器分红百分之二十很觉满意：“八年的损失，需要公家帮助，公家真不是为赚钱而是为发展人民事业来和我们合作的。”
    由于民主政府的扶植与解放区有利的经济条件，高阳城内工商业日益蓬勃发展，合记、恩记、同合、鸿记四家大的染轧工厂已经开工了，元丰的火磨已出产面粉，三益电灯公司为全城按上明亮的电灯，民主、幸福、同聚等小型织布工厂兴起了十五家，四月内印花厂从一、两家剧增至十家，有九家手工业染房复业了，三十一家经营布业的店也开张了，围绕着纺织业的发达，从日用品吃、喝、自行车、铁铺、药房一百余家的各业店铺摊贩，作坊都在这新兴的城市里获得了八年来未有的发展机会。
    但是，城市工商业仍赶不上集市与手工业的发展，主要原因是受了国民党破坏和平交通与贸易自由的影响，从北平、天津出来买布的商人，被无理的扣押没收，火车上禁止贩运布匹，对输入我区的机器与洋线，抽以重税，无限制提高价值，对我实行严格的封锁，这一切措施，实际上将更驱使迫切期待解放区物资援助的平津人民走向更加痛苦和贫困的生活。今天解放区人民已一致奋起涌入和平建设，他们有信心克服反动派所给予的新困难，他们已决心为着保卫解放区与建设解放区坚持斗争到彻底胜利。
