　　The Agony of Atomic Bomb Diplomacy
　　Dù Bō

According to the decision of the Potsdam Big Three to cooperate after the war to guarantee world peace and security, the United States had the obligation to publicly announce the secret of the atomic bomb to the world, in order to show its sincerity in guaranteeing world peace after the war. But unfortunately, the rulers of the gold-standard empire, after the end of the war, violated the friendly cooperation of the allied countries during the war, and disregarded the great contribution of the Red Army to the anti-fascist war of aggression. Before the Soviet Union had mastered atomic energy, they not only refused to place atomic energy under international control, but instead used it as a "magic weapon" in diplomacy, using it as a tool to bargain with the Soviet Union in international negotiations.

On August 7 last year, a U.S. aircraft dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan. At that time, the United States mobilized almost all newspapers and radio stations across the country, and even President Truman personally issued a statement to publicize the power of the atomic bomb. At that time, some reactionary elements in the United States, such as Vandenberg and the Hearst newspapers, took the opportunity to hype up the invention and practical application of the atomic bomb, describing it as the arrival of "the end of the world" and the "only reason" for forcing Japan to surrender. They deliberately exaggerated its power and erased the iron fact that the Red Army's defeat of the Kwantung Army was the decisive factor in forcing Japan to surrender quickly, vainly attempting to create atomic bomb terror to threaten the Soviet Union to make concessions on various post-war issues.

Precisely because of this, over the past year, in coordination with the international situation of alternating tension and relaxation, the United States has conducted two atomic bomb tests, one after the United Nations General Assembly last year, which was dropped in New Mexico in the southern United States, and the other on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands on the first of last month. This test was held during the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, not long before the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference.

What is particularly noteworthy is that for this test, the United States mobilized more publicity personnel to visit. A month before the test, news was released and hyped up, such as "the atomic bomb to be dropped this time will emit the heat and light of a thousand suns" and "Bikini will sink," which was sensationalizing. However, the results of the July 1 test not only failed to achieve the expected results, but on the contrary, gave people the feeling that the atomic bomb was "nothing more than that." Bikini did not "sink," and even the seventy-seven ships that served as the target of the atomic bomb were not destroyed. Goats were still chewing grass on the bombed warships, and fish were still swimming in the water. Commander Brandt, the commander-in-chief of the atomic bomb test, had to admit: "The atomic bomb test was not as moving as the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. The loss of ships was far less than expected, and some of the pigs and sheep used for the experiment did not die." This test failed beyond the expectations of the U.S. authorities.

42,000 people participated in this test, including naval personnel, scientists, technicians, and journalists, at a cost of more than 500 million US dollars. Although the test failed, U.S. officials have vowed to conduct another deep-water test soon. It can be seen that the American imperialists have not only not given up the sincerity of atomic bomb manufacturing, but are seeking to further improve it. When the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, President Truman once stated: "We have engaged in this unprecedented scientific gamble with Germany, spending 2 billion US dollars and employing 120,000 people to engage in this work." But today, when German and Japanese fascism has collapsed, the US gamble has not stopped, and the "bet" seems to be even more generous. What is it for? As British Communist Party Secretary Pollitt said, this is still the United States' "intimidation policy" in diplomacy. This "intimidation policy" is consistent with the "World Base Network Plan" and "Dollar Diplomacy" that the United States is gradually implementing, and is an attempt to realize its ambition to dominate the world. However, the "World Base Network Plan" and "Dollar Diplomacy" are used to deal with the whole world, while the main target of the atomic bomb "intimidation policy" is the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union has always maintained a calm and rational attitude towards the United States' "intimidation policy" of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union sincerely and firmly believes that the post-war world should be guided towards peace and security by the major powers, rather than towards mutual suspicion and war. Therefore, after this large-scale US test, Izakov, an observer for Pravda, only said with a regretful tone: "Although the atomic bomb test did not bring the world to the end, the things it destroyed are more important than one or two old ships, namely, our trust." Obviously, the Soviet Union did not feel uneasy because of the United States' "intimidation policy."

In order to safeguard world peace and security, the Soviet Union put forward a proposal in the Atomic Energy Joint Control Committee of the United Nations organization this spring, advocating that the United States make the secret of atomic energy public, jointly controlled by the United Nations, and destroy existing atomic bombs in order to end international competition for atomic energy and effectively prevent atomic weapons from being used in war. However, the U.S. authorities only agreed to announce the principles of atomic bomb manufacturing, but were unwilling to publish some engineering details of the manufacturing. The American reactionaries openly stated that the atomic bomb has "such a huge destructive power that it cannot but become a factor in our foreign policy." Therefore, the Atomic Energy Commission held several negotiations, but to no avail. In June and July, the Atomic Energy Commission held several meetings in succession, and the Soviet representative Koromyko put forward more specific proposals. The proposal is divided into two parts. The first is to prohibit the use, production and storage of atomic energy weapons under any circumstances, and to destroy all atomic energy weapons that have been manufactured or partially manufactured within three months. The second is to establish two committees under the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Committee to exchange scientific knowledge and information on atomic energy research in various countries, have the right to prevent countries from using atomic energy weapons to harm human beings without authorization, and maintain the veto power of various countries in the Atomic Energy Committee. Under duress, the U.S. representative Baruch also put forward a joint control plan, that is, to establish a committee in the Atomic Energy Control Committee, which not only has full power to control the manufacture and storage of atomic bombs in all countries, but also considers it illegal to use atomic energy for industrial production purposes, and cancels the veto power of various countries in the committee. These two proposals are far apart. According to the U.S. proposal, as long as it is under the supervision of the Atomic Energy Committee, it can continue to be manufactured, and there is no need to destroy the existing ones. Its advocacy of canceling the veto power of various countries in the Atomic Energy Committee is tantamount to saying, "I want to use it, and you can't control me." As a result, the United Nations' decision to guarantee world peace and security after the war has become a dead letter, and the Atomic Energy Control Committee has become a figurehead organization that does not play any role. Therefore, only the implementation of the Soviet proposal can effectively prohibit the use of atomic energy weapons in war, which is in line with the interests of mankind in the world and is also what the American people hope for.

As far as the Soviet Union itself is concerned, it has strong power, and atomic energy weapons are not terrible. Although the Soviet Union has not yet invented effective weapons to defend against atomic bombs, it has a vast territory in Eurasia, with mountains crisscrossing the country, industry is relatively dispersed, and the population is mainly not concentrated in a few large cities, so the effectiveness of atomic bombs cannot be fully exerted in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet Union has a very strong aviation industry and technology. At present, the most effective method of defending against atomic bomb attacks is to actively send aircraft to find the opponent's aircraft carrying atomic bombs to fight to the death, or to find the base where atomic bombs are stored and completely destroy it. The number of atomic bombs manufactured is limited, so it has no decisive effect on the war at all, which is already unanimously recognized by strategists from various countries. Moreover, the Soviet Union is a country that advocates science and has countless outstanding scientists, as well as rich mineral deposits indispensable for manufacturing atomic bombs. Take uranium (a rare metal in the world) used to split atoms as an example. As far as we know now, the main producing areas of uranium mines in the world are only the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Belgium and Canada. Other countries either have very low output or have none at all. Another favorable condition for the Soviet Union is that it has made new important discoveries in the study of atomic energy. According to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Soviet scientists have achieved achievements that exceed those of any other country in the study of "cosmic rays" in the Caucasus Mountains, and they use "cosmic rays" to split atoms, which is much more effective than uranium. Once the research is successful, it will be the most outstanding development in the contribution of atomic energy science. Even American scientists admit that, with the Soviet Union's current scientific level, it will be able to manufacture atomic bombs within two to five years, and they will be better than the existing atomic bombs. The famous French scientist Levy estimates that the Soviet Union will master atomic energy weapons within two years. These scientists' estimates are by no means without basis.

Since the United States is unwilling to make the secret of atomic energy public, of course it has no right to prevent other countries from conducting atomic bomb research and manufacturing for national defense security. The United States is the country with the most concentrated population and economy and industry, and it cannot withstand atomic bomb attacks. Therefore, those American reactionaries who continue to advocate keeping the secret of atomic bombs are increasingly feeling the terror of this threat, advocating dispersing the population and industry of major American cities, but the dispersion of industry will cause serious economic dislocations and economic chaos in the country, which is actually impossible in the United States. Far-sighted people in the United States, such as Wallace, advocate making the secret of atomic bombs public and placing them under the joint control of the United Nations. The scientists who study atomic bombs in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, believe that only by seeking an international control method can the world avoid going down the road of suicide, and condemn those who advocate keeping the secret of atomic bombs for misleading the American people.

In addition, regarding the issue of atomic energy, the U.S. monopoly capitalists have another "unspeakable" distress.

The United States invented atomic energy, the United States used atomic bombs as diplomatic weapons, and the United States is most afraid of atomic energy. why? Because the invention of atomic energy is a leap in the development of human social productivity. Once applied to production, its productivity will be much greater than steam and electricity, and it will produce more goods for human society. However, to fully utilize the productivity of atomic energy, there is a major premise, that is, the change of social relations of production, which requires the complete collectivization and nationalization of the social economy of various countries. This is "not what I want" in capitalist countries, especially in the United States under the dictatorship of financial oligarchs, because that will completely disintegrate the private economic system of the existing capitalist society in the United States. And the only country in the world that has the conditions to use atomic energy for social construction is still the Soviet Union today. The Soviet Union is currently studying atomic energy and has made important achievements. Once the Soviet Union masters atomic energy, it will of course be applied to production first, which is a major super-war threat to the bosses on Wall Street.

This is the reason why the U.S. representative on the Atomic Energy Commission proposed that "the use of atomic energy for industrial production purposes is also illegal."

　　原子弹外交的苦恼
    杜波
    根据波茨顿三大强国战后合作保证世界和平安全的决定，美国有义务将原子弹秘密公开向世人宣布，以表示其对战后世界和平保证的诚意。但是可惜得很，金元帝国的统治者们，在战争结束以后，却违背了同盟国家在战争中的和谐合作的友谊，不顾红军对反法西斯侵略战争的伟大贡献，乘苏联还没有掌握原子能以前，不仅不愿把原子能置于国际共管之下，反而当做外交上的“法宝”，在国际谈判中作为向苏联讨价还价的工具。
    去年八月七日，美机在日本濑户内海的广岛，投掷了第一颗原子弹，当时美国几乎动员了全国所有报纸与广播电台，甚至杜鲁门总统也亲自发表声明，扩大宣传原子弹的威力。当时美国一部份反动派，如范登堡之流及赫斯特系报纸，更借此大事吹嘘，把原子弹的发明与实际运用，描写为“世界末日”降临和迫使日本投降的“唯一原因”，故意夸大其威力，而抹煞红军击败关东军为迫使日本迅速投降之决定因素的这一铁的事实，妄图造成原子弹的恐怖，威胁苏联对战后各种问题的让步。
    正因为如此，一年来，配合着国际间一张一弛的情势，美国曾举行了两次原子弹的试验，一次是在去年联合国大会以后，投掷在美国南部的新墨西哥州，另一次就是上月一日在马群岛中的比基尼珊瑚礁。这次试验举行这巴黎四国外长会议期间，二十一国和会之前不久。
    特别值得注意的，是这次试验，美国动员了更多的宣传人员去参观。在试验之前一个月就发出消息，大事吹嘘，什么“这次所投掷的原子弹，将发出一千个太阳之热与光”呀，“比基尼将陆沉”呀，耸人听闻，不一而足。但是七月一日试验的结果，不仅未达到预期的效果，相反的却给人们以原子弹“不过如此”的感觉，比基尼并未“陆沉”，即作为原子弹鹄的的七十七艘船舰，也未能摧毁；炸后的军舰上，山羊还在站着嚼草，鱼儿依然悠游在水中。原子弹试验总指挥官勃兰第海军中将也只得承认：“原子弹试验，并不如日军偷袭珍珠港一幕之动人，船舶之损失，远不如预期之大，供实验之猪羊，亦有未死者”。这次试验是出乎美国当局的意料而失败了。
    参加这次试验的有四万二千人，其中包括海军、科学家、技术人员及新闻记者，耗资在五万万美元以上。试验虽然失败了，美国官方却扬言在不久将再作一次深水试验。可见美国帝国主义者不仅没有放弃原子弹制造的诚意，却正在企求进一步的加以改良。当第一颗原子弹在广岛投下时，杜鲁门总统就曾经声明：“吾人曾与德国进行此史无前例的科学上的赌博，用费达二十万万元，十二万人从事此项工作”。但在德日法西斯业已垮台的今天，美国这种赌博并未停止，所下的“赌注”似乎更加豪爽了，究竟是为的什么呢？诚如英共书记波立特所说，这仍然是美国在外交上的“恫吓政策”。这种“恫吓政策”，是与美国正在逐步推行的“世界基地网计划”、“金元外交”相一致的，是企图实现其独霸世界的野心。不过“世界基地网计划”及“金元外交”，是用以对付全世界的，而原子弹“恫吓政策”的主要对象却是苏联。
    苏联对于美国这种原子武器的“恫吓政策”，一直保持着冷静与理智的态度。苏联诚恳而坚定的认为战后的世界，各大强国应导向和平安全，而不应导向互相猜疑和战争。因此，在这次美国大规模试验之后，真理报观察家伊萨科夫仅带着惋惜的口吻说：“原子弹试验虽未使世界临于末日，但所破坏之事物，有较一二艘旧舰更为重要者，即吾人之信任心是也”。很显然的，苏联并未因美国这种“恫吓政策”而感觉不安。
    苏联为了保卫世界的和平与安全，在今年春天，曾在联合国组织机构中的原子能共同管制委员会提出建议，主张美国把原子能秘密公开，由联合国共同管制，并破坏现存的原子弹，以结束国际间原子能的竞争，有效制止原子武器用于战争。但是美国当局仅答应宣布原子弹制造的原理，对制造上的若干工程细则却不愿公布，美国反动派并公开声言，原子弹具有“如此巨大的毁灭性，不能不成为我们外交政策中的一个因素”，因此原子能委员会几经谈判，终无结果。六七月间，原子能委员会又曾连续举行了几次会谈，苏联代表柯罗米科提出了更具体的建议，这个建议共分两部份，一是在任何情况下，禁止使用、生产及保存原子能武器，在三个月内将一切已经制成或制成一部份的原子能武器全部予以破坏；二是在联合国原子能管制委员会之下设立两个委员会，以交换有关各国原子能研究的科学知识和情报，有权防止各国擅自利用原子能武器伤害人类，并保持原子能委员会中各国的否决权。美国代表巴鲁区在被迫的情况下，也提出了一个共同管制的方案，就是在原子能管制委员会中设立一个委员会，不仅有全权管制一切国家之原子弹的制造与保藏，而且认为利用原子能为工业生产上的用途亦为违法，并在该委员会中，取消各国的否决权。这两个提案是相距很远的，根据美国的提案，只要在原子能委员会监督之下，还是可以继续制造，现存的也不必破坏，而其所主张取消原子能委员会中各国的否决权，又无异是“我要使用，你管不着我”的说法，结果还是使联合国保证战后世界和平安全的决定，成为一纸空文，原子能管制委员会成为不起任何作用的空头机关。因此，只有实行苏联的提案，才能有效的禁止原子能武器用于战争，才是合乎世界人类利益的，也是美国人民所希望的。
    对于苏联本身来讲，它具有强大力量，原子能武器并不是可怕的东西。苏联虽然还没发明有效防御原子弹的武器，但它却有广袤欧亚大陆的领土，国内山脉纵横，工业比较分散，人口主要不是集中在几个大城市里，原子弹的效能在苏联并不能充分发挥。同时，苏联有很强大的航空工业和技术，目前最有效的防御原子弹袭击的方法，便是主动派遣飞机寻找对方载有原子弹的飞机作战而同归于尽，或者寻找保藏原子弹的基地予以彻底摧毁。原子弹制造的数量是有限的，因此对战争完全没有什么决定作用，这已经是各国战略家所一致公认的。况且，苏联是一个科学倡明的国家，拥有无数优秀的科学家，也有丰富的制造原子弹不可缺少的矿藏。就拿用以分裂原子的铀（世界上稀有的金属）来说，就目前所知，世界铀矿的主要产地仅有苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、比利时和加拿大，其他各国不是产量很少，就是完全没有。苏联的另外一个有利条件，是它在研究原子能上，已经有了新的重要的发现。据苏联科学院宣布，苏联科学家在高加索山中研究“宇宙线”，已经获得超过任何国家的成就，并且用“宇宙线”来分裂原子，比铀的效能大得多，一旦研究成功，在原子能科学的贡献上，将是最卓越的发展。即使美国的科学家们也承认，以苏联今天的科学水平，在二年到五年的期间，必能制造原子弹，且将较现有的原子弹更为优良。而法国的著名科学家李维估计，苏联在两年之内，便将掌握原子能武器。这些科学家的估计决不是没有根据的。
    美国既然不愿将原子能秘密公开，当然它没有权力阻止别的国家为了国防安全而进行原子弹的研究与制造。美国是一个人口和经济工业最集中的国家，最经受不起原子弹的袭击。因此，目前那些继续主张保守原子弹秘密的美国反动派们，正日益感受这种威胁的可怕，主张将美国各大城市的人口与工业分散，但工业分散，又将引起国内严重的经济脱节与经济紊乱，事实上在美国是办不到的。美国有远见的人士如华莱士等，便主张把原子弹秘密公开，置于联合国共同管制之下。在美国田纳西州象岭研究原子弹的科学家们，更认为只有寻求一个国际管制的方法，才能避免世界走上自杀的道路，并谴责那些主张保持原子弹秘密的人，是把美国人民导入歧途。
    此外，关于原子能的问题，美国独占资本的大亨们还有一个“难言之隐”的苦恼。
    发明原子能的是美国，利用原子弹为外交武器的是美国，对原子能最为恐惧的也是美国。为什么？因为原子能的发明，是人类社会生产力的一个飞跃的发展，一旦应用到生产上去，它的生产力将较蒸气和电力大得多，将给人类社会生产更多的物品。但是，要充分利用原子能的生产力，有一个重大的前提，那便是社会生产关系的变革，要求各国社会经济完全集体化和国家化，而这在资本主义国家，尤其是金融寡头专政的美国，是“非吾所愿”的，因为那将使美国现存的资本主义社会的私有经济制度完全解体。而世界唯一具备以原子能用于社会建设事业之条件的国家，在今天还只有苏联。苏联目前正在研究原子能，并且获得了重要的成就，苏联一旦掌握了原子能，当然会首先应用到生产上去，这对于华尔街的老板们是一个重大的超战争的威胁。
    在原子能委员会上，美国代表之所以提出“利用原子能为工业生产上的用途亦为违法”，原因就在这里。
