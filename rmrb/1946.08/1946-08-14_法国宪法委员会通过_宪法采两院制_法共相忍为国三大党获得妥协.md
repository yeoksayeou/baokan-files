Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Paris Airmail: On July 4th, the French Constitutional Committee passed the principle of adopting a two-chamber system for the French Fourth Republic. According to this principle, the new France will have a House of Representatives (lower house) and a Senate (upper house) with limited powers. The government will not be responsible to the upper house, and the upper house's power will be limited to reviewing bills passed by the House of Representatives and sending them back for reconsideration. Regarding the president, the Constitutional Committee decided that he will be elected by the two houses and given considerable power, including the right to propose a candidate for prime minister. However, the latter must be approved by a majority in the House of Representatives before forming a cabinet. Other issues are still under discussion. The Constitutional Committee's decision is the result of a compromise among the three major parties, especially the French Communist Party's endurance for the sake of the nation. Originally, the French Communist Party insisted on the previous democratic constitution.

    法共相忍为国三大党获得妥协
　　【新华社延安十日电】巴黎航讯：法国宪法委员会七月四日通过了法兰西第四共和国采取两院制的原则，按照该原则，新法国将设一众院（下院）与一权力有限的参院（上院）。政府不对上院负责，上院之权力仅限于审查众院所通过之法案，及送回复议。关于总统，宪委会决定：他将由二院会选，并给他以相当权力，使其有权提出总理人选。唯后者须经众院多数之核准后始能组织内阁。至于其他问题，正在讨论中。此次宪委会之上述决定，乃三大党妥协的结果，尤其是共产党相忍为国的结果。原来法共是坚持前次的民主宪法的。
