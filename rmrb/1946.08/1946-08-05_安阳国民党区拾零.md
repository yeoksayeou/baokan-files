Due to the extraordinarily heavy burdens, 30-40% of the shops in Anyang city have closed down, especially the larger businesses. Those that haven't closed have transformed from merchants with fixed locations to traveling merchants, traveling merchants to small stalls, and small stalls to peddlers, all concentrated in the less than two-acre Gao Ge Temple. This has formed a distorted prosperity. In this single location, the Kuomintang collects 1.6 million yuan in land rent from the stallholders in a single day, which is imaginable. Public opinion says, "The desolation on the main streets is unprecedented, and the prosperity of Gao Ge Market is unprecedented." Rents have soared, and generally, the poor have been driven out.

The die-hard troops borrow things and don't return them, and when they borrow doors, they take one leaf from each door, so that every family can't close their doors, making it easy to wander around and rape women. The masses deeply hate this. When the die-hard troops go to the Bao Public Office, they demand good food; if they don't eat, they demand money instead, and then they go to other villages to demand again. The masses feel they are just like the "puppet troops" and dare to be angry but dare not speak out.

The students in Anyang's middle schools have a very bad life; they can't get enough congee and steamed buns, and there are no vegetables. Students generally lean towards peace and democracy and are not interested in the Three People's Principles Youth League. They can read newspapers like *Ta Kung Pao*, and when they see reports of the Red Army capturing a certain place, they go outside and cheer: "Welcome the Eighth Route Army!" A thought test for students in various schools: "Is it better to strive for peace through cultural democracy or through military force?" More than 90% answered the former. A student at one school asked a teacher what materialism and idealism were. The teacher couldn't answer and finally said: "A thousand good words are not as good as a piece of bread."

　　安阳国民党区拾零
    因负担奇重，安阳城内商店关门者达百分之三四十，特别是几家大生意。没有关门者是坐商变行商，行商变小摊，小摊变小贩，都集中在不及二亩大的高阁寺。形成一种畸形繁荣，单此一地国民党向摊贩一天即收地皮税一百六十万元，可想而知。社会上舆论说：“大街上萧条是空前，高阁市繁荣是空前”。房租高涨，一般穷苦人民都被赶出。
    顽军借东西不还，借门板是每个门上摘一扇，叫你家家不能关门，好乱串门，奸淫妇女，群众对痛此恨已极。顽军到保公所就要好饭吃，不吃饭折成钱也行，然后再到别村要，群众感觉与“皇协军”一样，敢怒而不敢言。
    安阳各中学学生生活很坏，稀饭，馍吃不饱，没菜。学生思想一般倾向和平，民主，对三青团不感兴趣。看报能看大公报，看了报上登出红军攻下某地，便出外欢呼：“欢迎八路军”。各校学生思想测验：“以文化民主争取和平，还是以武力争取和平”，百分之九十以上答是前者。某校学生问教员，什么叫唯物论与唯心论，教员无法答，最后说：你给我说一千句好话，不如给我一块面包。
