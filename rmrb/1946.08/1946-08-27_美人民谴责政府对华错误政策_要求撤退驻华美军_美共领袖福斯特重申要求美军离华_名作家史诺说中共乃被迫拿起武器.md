　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: Following the publication of the Marshall statement, the movement of the American people demanding that the U.S. government correct its erroneous China policy and withdraw U.S. troops from China has expanded more widely. The Committee to Secure Peace led nine mass meetings, with over 4,000 participants, who sent letters to Truman demanding the withdrawal of U.S. Marines from China and requesting that assistance to China be halted until a democratic government is established. The Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) wrote to Truman on the 15th of this month, demanding the complete withdrawal of American troops from China. The letter condemned the U.S. government authorities for using military and financial power to encourage Chinese reactionaries to fight against the people striving for democracy and peace while Marshall was "mediating," stating that this measure was contradictory. It also strongly advocated that "the political destiny of a country should be determined by its people and parties." Thirty-six professors from the City University of New York sent a joint telegram to Truman on the 16th, requesting the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from China and the cessation of financial and military aid to China, pending the establishment of a democratic coalition government. Foster, Chairman of the American Communist Party, who is currently visiting San Francisco, recently reiterated the American Communist Party's policy of demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. At a press conference, Foster asserted: "In China, our government is supporting the fascist government of Chiang Kai-shek in destroying democratic forces and is preparing a base to attack the Soviet Union with the assistance of the Chinese army." Foster listed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China as one of the elements of world peace. General Carlson, Chairman of the Committee to Secure Peace, delivered a speech to veterans on the 19th, demanding the immediate recall of U.S. Marines from China. Senator Ellender, who had traveled to the Far East, stated during a broadcast that U.S. Marines could not continue to remain in China, and that if they continued to stay, it would cause great tragedy. He also said that the quicker the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, the more beneficial it would be to the United States; if the Chinese civil war continues, the United Nations should intervene. Black representative Cripps said that black people demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China and the cessation of American colonial policies. American writer Snow stated that the Chinese Communist Party was compelled to take up arms, and that it did so to prevent the corrupt and dictatorial Kuomintang government from eliminating its supporters. He said: "We are 16,000 kilometers away from China and are using the excuses used by Japan to invade China and the Nazis in Europe to establish a unilateral alliance, which is fundamentally a denial of the autonomy and independence of the Chinese people." The New York Times published a letter from reader Keel on the 20th, criticizing the newspaper's incorrect statement that it seemed the Communist Party was undermining the ceasefire agreement. Keel stated: "Marshall's mediation work is a farce; comforting people with one hand while helping the other side." Keel requested the recall of U.S. troops from the Chinese side, so that the Chinese people could establish a coalition government according to their own will.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: According to a New York dispatch by the Associated Press carried in the Tianjin Yishibao on August 17, thirty-six professors from New York University, Columbia University, and Queens College recently sent a telegram to President Truman, requesting the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China and expressing their shock and dismay at the assassination of Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu in Kunming. Similar requests were also sent to Acting Secretary of State Acheson and Congress, stating: "The American academic community is shocked and dismayed by the news that Professors Li and Wen were recently assassinated in Kunming for freely expressing their opinions. Professor Wen was a famous Chinese writer and a graduate of the University of Chicago. After Li Gongpu was assassinated, Wen delivered a passionate speech at the memorial service, and unexpectedly, he was also assassinated four hours later. As university professors in New York City, in view of this serious incident and the original intention of establishing a united and democratic China, we demand that the U.S. military immediately withdraw from China and cease all financial and military aid to China until a democratic coalition government is established, and then resume it."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: According to the U.S. Information Service, Washington, 21st: The recent serious situation in China has aroused greater attention from American public opinion. American radio commentator Schilling declared on the exchange radio station on the 20th that the situation in China is a problem that the United Nations should consider.

　　美人民谴责政府对华错误政策
    要求撤退驻华美军
    美共领袖福斯特重申要求美军离华
    名作家史诺说中共乃被迫拿起武器
    【新华社延安廿四日电】马司声明发表后，美国人民要求美国政府改正对华错误政策撤退驻华美军的运动更广泛展开。争取和平委员会领导举行了九个群众大会，大会参加者四千余人，致函杜鲁门要求从中国撤退美国海军陆战队，并要求在中国尚未建立民主政府之前停止帮助中国。美国产业工会联合会所属政治行动委员会于本月十五日上书杜鲁门，要求美国军队全部自中国撤退。该函谴责美政府当局在马歇尔方在“调停”之同时，利用军事及财政力量鼓励中国反动分子对争取民主与和平的人民作战，此种措施实属矛盾。并力主“一国之政治命运应由其人民及政党自行决定”。纽约市大学教授三十六人十六日联名电请杜鲁门立刻撤退在华美军，停止对华金融与军事援助，以待民主联合政府成立。现正访问旧金山之美共主席福斯特顷重申美共要求美军撤离中国之方针。福斯特在招待记者席上力称：“在中国我们的政府是在支持蒋介石法西斯政府摧毁民主势力，是在中国陆军协助之下准备进攻苏联的基地。”福斯特把美军撤离中国列为世界和平要素之一。争取和平委员会主席卡尔逊将军十九日对参战军人发表演说，要求从中国立即召回美国海军陆战队。游历远东回来的参议员艾伦德广播时主张美海军陆战队不能继续留在中国，如果继续留华，将引起很大的惨剧。并称：驻华美军撤退迅速，则越有利于美国；中国内战如继续不停，联合国应加以干涉。黑人代表克利浦斯说：黑人要求美军撤出中国，停止美国的殖民地政策。美国著名作家史诺声明：中国共产党是迫不得已拿起武器的，其所以这样作，是不让国民党腐败独裁的政府消灭自己的拥护者。他说：“我们与中国相距一万六千公里，采用日本侵略中国及纳粹在欧洲所使用过的借口建立单方面的联盟，基本是否认中国人民的自主与独立。”纽约时报二十日公布读者基尔一封信，指责该报不正确的声明：似乎是共产党破坏停战协定。基氏声明说：“马歇尔的调停工作是一出滑稽戏；以一只手在安慰人，而另一只手又在帮助其中之另一方面。”基氏要求从中国方面召回美驻军，使中国人民有可能按照自己的意志建立联合政府。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】据天津益世报八月十七日载美联社纽约讯：纽约大学、哥伦比亚大学、及皇后学院等校教授三十六人，顷致电杜鲁门总统，要求撤退驻华美军，并对闻一多、李公朴在昆明被刺事件，表示不胜惊震。同时并有类似请求送致代理国务卿亚泽逊及国会称：李、闻两名教授因自由发表意见而于最近在昆明被着消息传来，美学术界人士不胜惊震，闻教授乃著名之中国文学家，且为芝加哥大学之毕业生。李公朴被刺之后，闻氏乃于追悼会上悲愤陈词，不意四小时后，亦被暗杀。吾人身为纽约城之大学教授，鉴于此种严重事件与建立联合民主中国之初衷，要求美军立即退出中国，并停止一切对华金钱与军事上之援助，直至民主之联合政府成立时，再行恢复。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】据美新闻处华盛顿二十一日讯：最近中国之严重形势已引起美舆论更大注意，美无线电评论家希霖，二十日在交换广播电台宣称：中国之情势为联合国应予考虑之问题。
