　　The Chengcí County Leadership Unleashes
    Over a Hundred Villages Launch Purge Movement
    [Our newspaper, Weixian News] Chengcí County corrected its "not letting go" work style, and over a hundred villages launched a purge movement. The anti-traitor movement in the county began in late April, but because the leadership had a "fear of leftism" mentality, cadres were constrained and acted as substitutes, and the masses never truly mobilized. In mid-July, after the peasant turnaround team arrived in the county, they cooperated with the county to jointly hold meetings for district and village cadres in three districts, re-emphasizing the need to boldly let go and let the masses grasp the policies. They emphasized taking care of the interests of middle peasants, uniting the majority of peasants to participate in the turnaround movement, controlling peasant armed forces, and cracking down on traitorous and special agent sabotage activities, thoroughly resolving the cadres' thinking. The turnaround team was divided into groups to create experiences in various base villages. In less than a month, most villages had launched a vigorous movement to speak out about grievances. In Shangcheng Town, peasants and those who had turned themselves around, under the slogan of "first pull out the tough nails," overthrew local bullies and landlords Wang Shiqing, Zheng Zuchang, and others, greatly delighting the people. Merchants and middle peasants widely joined the movement. Landlord lackey Wang Lantong and the militia captain who had been bought off by the landlord both confessed to the masses and exposed the landlord's conspiracy. A broad-based movement for peasants to speak out about grievances is about to unfold. Although Dongbao Village had undergone joint struggles, because the cadres were controlled by local bullies and landlords and separated from the masses, the masses had no confidence in turning themselves around. After the turnaround team understood the situation, they secretly contacted activists while educating the village chiefs who were taking the landlord's line. Lian Zhuang, Tailian Zhuang, and six other villages have formed a large alliance. Changquan Village appropriately distributed the fruits of struggle, strengthened internal unity, and Wang Hengcheng and other seven villages, with thousands of peasants, formed a large alliance, struggling against local bullies and landlords Wang Yongliang and four others. Zhao Jia Zhuang transformed the village government controlled by the landlord, and the masses gradually became active. The Chengcí mass movement is developing vigorously.

　　成磁县领导上放开了手
    百余村掀起清算运动
    【本报威县讯】成磁县纠正不放手作风，百余村庄掀起清算运动，该县反奸运动，四月底即已开始，但因领导上存在“怕左”思想，干部束手束脚，包办代替，群众始终没有真正行动起来。七月中旬农民翻身队到达该县后，与县里配合，共同召开了三个区的区村干部会议，重新强调提出大胆放手，把政策交给群众掌握。强调照顾中农利益，团结大多数农民参加翻身运动，掌握农民武装，打击奸特破坏活动等，彻底打通干部思想。翻身队分组到各基点村创造经验。不到一月，大部村庄已掀起了轰轰烈烈的诉苦运动。商城镇农民和翻身者在“先拔硬钉子”的口号下，斗倒了恶霸地主王士清、郑祖昌等，人心大快。商人与中农普遍投入运动。地主狗腿王兰桐，和被地主收买的民兵队长，均相继向群众坦白，并揭露地主阴谋。广大农民诉苦运动即将展开。东保庄虽进行过联合斗争，因干部被恶霸地主掌握，脱离群众，群众对翻身没有信心。翻身组了解情况后，一面抓紧积极分子进行秘密串连，一面教育走地主路线的村长，连庄、泰连庄等六村，已组成大联合。长券村适当的分配了斗争果实，加强了内部团结，王横城等七村，数千农民组成了大联合，斗争了恶霸地主王永亮等五人，赵家庄经翻身改造了地主掌握的村政权，群众才逐渐活跃，成磁群运正猛烈开展中。
