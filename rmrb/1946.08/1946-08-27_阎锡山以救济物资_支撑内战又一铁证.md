　　Yan Xishan Using Relief Supplies
    to Support the Civil War: Another Ironclad Proof
    [Tongpu Frontline, 24th Dispatch] Yan Xishan's use of UNRRA relief supplies for the civil war has once again been proven in the recent Hongzhao campaign. The Eighth Route Army discovered a large quantity of canned milk in many Yan puppet army barracks and bunkers, with the words (USA) (Luak) (Milk) printed on the cans, which immediately aroused suspicion from all parties here. The reporter visited various businesses throughout the city, and according to them, none of them had sold this type of canned milk. According to captured Yan army soldiers, this was UNRRA relief material, and Yan Xishan distributed this milk to officers above the rank of platoon leader to encourage their enthusiasm for the civil war.

　　阎锡山以救济物资
    支撑内战又一铁证
    【同蒲前线二十四日电】阎锡山以联总救济物资用于内战，已在此次洪赵战役中再次获得证明。八路军在许多阎伪军营房碉堡中，发现大批罐头牛乳，桶上印有（USA）（Luak）（Milk）字样，当即引起此间各方怀疑。记者曾向全城各商号访问，据云：均未出售此项罐头。另据被俘阎军士兵称：此系联总救济物资，凡排长以上军官，阎锡山均发给此项牛乳，以鼓励内战情绪。
