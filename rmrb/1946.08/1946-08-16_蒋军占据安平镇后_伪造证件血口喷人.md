Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, August 11th: Since forcibly occupying Anping Town, the Kuomintang side has been massively fabricating false evidence regarding the Anping Incident. The Kuomintang troops and special agent organs occupying the area have been conducting intense activities, intimidating and coercing local residents to testify to the various facts regarding the Anping Incident as alleged by the Kuomintang and the U.S. Navy. Although the Kuomintang side is doing its utmost to keep it secret, it still cannot conceal the traces of fabrication. Huang Rencai, Commissioner of the Fifth Administrative Region of Hebei Province of the Kuomintang, told an Yishibao reporter on the 7th: "Sufficient evidence has been obtained to prove that the Anping Incident was an ambush set by the Communist army." Huang described his so-called experience of "obtaining evidence" in Anping Town, saying: "The local residents initially seemed very frightened and did not explain the course of the battle. After the U.S. troops arrived, the National Army gathered, and senior officials came to the town, they were informed of the great righteousness, and finally told the situation at that time. The most prominent evidence at present is that the original owner of the ox cart blocking the road has been found, and there are signed documents in the villages in the area where the incident occurred." Based on the methods used by the Kuomintang warlords and special agent organs to rule the people and handle the Kunming Massacre, the Xiaguan Massacre, and other incidents, it is not difficult to understand the nature of these so-called "evidences." Reliable sources confirm that the joint U.S.-Chiang military occupation of Anping Town and the repeated delays in the investigation time are precisely for the purpose of manufacturing these so-called "evidences." After these "evidences" are fabricated, they suddenly change their attitude and demand immediate "on-site investigation." Neutral observers believe that only by withdrawing the occupying forces of the U.S. and Chiang from Anping Town and completely restoring the area to its original state before July 29th can the on-site investigation have correct results. They also said that if the U.S. refuses to implement this only reasonable step, then people cannot but believe that the Anping Incident contains inside information that is very unfavorable to the U.S. and Chiang.

　　蒋军占据安平镇后
    伪造证件血口喷人
    【新华社北平十一日电】国民党方面在武力占领安平镇以后，已大量伪造关于安平事件的假证据。占领该地的国民党军与国民党特务机关，已进行了猛烈活动，恐吓与强迫当地居民，证实国民党方面与美海军方面关于安平事件的各种事实。国民党方面虽然竭力保守秘密，但仍不能掩盖假造的形迹。国民党河北省第五区专员黄任材七日向益世报记者称：“已获得充足证据证明安平事件为共军设伏”。黄氏叙述其所谓在安平镇“获得证据”的经过说：“该地居民初似甚恐惧，对战事经过未有说明。俟美军开到，国军云集，大员莅临时，晓以大义，终于说出当时情况。目前之显著证据为拦路牛车已寻到原主，肇事地区各村已有签名之文件”。根据国民党军阀与特务机关统治人民以及处理昆明惨案、下关惨案等事件的方法，不难明了这些所谓“证据”的性质。可靠方面证实，美方与蒋方共同武力占领安平镇，并再三拖延调查时间，正是为了制造这些所谓“证据”。而在这些“证据”造好以后，他们就突然改变态度，要求立即实行所谓“实地调查”。中立的观察家认为只有从安平镇撤退美蒋两方的占领军，完全恢复该地在七月廿九日以前的原状，实地调查才能有其正确的结果。并称，美方如果拒绝实行这个唯一合理的步骤，那么人们就不能不相信安平事件包含着对于美方与蒋方十分不利的内幕。
