Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 4th: Over two thousand cadres in the Jin-Sui Border Region gathered at the Jin-Sui Sub-bureau of the Chinese Communist Party at 4:00 PM on the 31st of last month to mourn the passing of Comrade Guan Xiangying, one of the founders of the Jin-Sui Liberated Area. Commander He Long was already in tears as he presented flowers on behalf of everyone, and many of the cadres present were also weeping with grief. Li Jingquan, Political Commissar of the Military Region, delivered a eulogy, calling on all Party and military cadres in the Jin-Sui region to learn from Political Commissar Guan's excellent proletarian qualities, turn grief into strength, and victoriously fight the enemy. He also stated that in the past, "He and Guan" were our banner of victory, just like the hammer and sickle on the Party flag, and that in the future, under the leadership of Comrade He Long, we must complete Political Commissar Guan's unfinished tasks. Mr. Liu Shaobai, Deputy Speaker of the Border Region Assembly, said: "Political Commissar Guan paid for the people with his life, and he will always live in the hearts of the people." The memorial service lasted for three hours, and a "Memorial Album of Comrade Guan Xiangying" will be compiled for cadres to study Political Commissar Guan's thoughts and style.
