　　Everyone Happily Rushes to Pay Public Grain
    People's Burden Greatly Reduced in Xinxiang New District
    Zhang Taixiao's Labor Exchange Team Achieves Good Results
    [Our newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The people's burden in Xiuwu County has been greatly reduced this summer. In the newly liberated Xidaiwang Village, the total amount of burden is 152,200 jin less than the amount of grain requisitioned by the stubborn puppet army last year. Moreover, because the village administration has been reformed, the assessment and distribution are fair and serious. The masses are very satisfied and paid all of it on the 17th and 18th of this month. The general reaction is: "It's not even as much as the temporary meals that the Central Team used to dispatch in the village!" The rich peasant Cheng Huirong said: "My family paid seventeen dan last year, but only one dan and three dou this year; the Eighth Route Army worked hard to protect us in harvesting wheat, and I am willing to support another dan!" Middle peasant Fan Chenggong also automatically paid fifty jin more, his reason being "to let our Eighth Route Army eat their fill and beat the bad troops attacking the liberated areas far away!" Everyone feels that since the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came, the common people have enjoyed happiness, so the wheat is delivered quickly and well. When the leadership called on them to oppose the civil war, the masses said: "Whoever wants to fight a civil war will be eliminated!" "With strong soldiers and sufficient grain, we will surely be victorious!"
    [Another dispatch] Xiatun in the Second District of Anyang completed it very quickly. In Lijia Village in the district, the grain was all delivered in just two days. A folk song is circulating in the village saying: "The public grain is light, and the assessment is fair and serious. We have all been liberated, and paying a little public grain expresses our gratitude!"
    [Changzhi, 28th dispatch] Zhang Taixiao, a labor hero from Sanjiaohe Village, Xiyang, has actively helped the masses become prosperous in this year's great production movement, and is even more loved by the masses in the village. The labor exchange team led by Zhang Taixiao is united and consolidated, and is a model labor exchange team in the county. Every farmer who participates can recognize the benefits of organizing mutual assistance and actively engages in production. The labor exchange team has become everyone's reliance. The team has forty-four households and one hundred and eighty-two people. Before planting this spring, Zhang Taixiao led everyone to cut trees on the mountain for three days and transported them to Nanzuo Town, Yuanshi, to exchange for 2,000 jin of salt, which solved the problem of salt consumption for the whole team this year. Over the past two years, most of the team has become prosperous. There are only six poor households left in the team. Zhang Taixiao immediately mobilized the whole team to help them become prosperous, ensuring that they will all completely rise to the level of middle peasants this year. They reclaimed five mu of wasteland for Zheng Cungui, and helped Sui Chengxi cut and transport mountain goods together, earning 5,000 yuan to buy eight mu of hillside land. Zhang Taixiao also lent out 6,000 yuan earned from selling cattle this spring to help the remaining households buy land, and also helped them raise pigs. The masses in the village said: "We were liberated thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, but Zhang Taixiao is the one who directly led us to liberation."

　　人人高兴抢缴公粮
    修武新区民负大减
    张太小拨工队成绩好
    【本报长治讯】修武县今年夏季人民负担大大减轻。新解放的西待王村，全部负担数目比去年顽伪军统治时的派粮一项还少十五万二千二百斤，且因村政得到改革，评议分派都很公道认真。群众非常满意，在本月十七、十八两日内就全部交齐了。一般的反映是：“还没有中央队到村上临时派饭吃的多哩！”富农程会荣老汉说：“我家去年出十七石，今年才一石三；八路军辛辛苦苦保卫咱收麦，我情愿多拥护一石！”中农范承功也自动多交五十斤，他的理由是“叫咱八路军吃得饱饱的，把进攻解放区的坏军队打得远远的！”大家都觉得共产党、八路军来了以后，老百姓享了福，所以交的麦子又快又好。当领导上号召反内战时，群众说：“谁要打内战就把他消灭！”“兵又强，粮又足，一定能够胜利！”
    【又讯】安阳二区夏屯完成得很快。该区李家岗，只两天就交齐了。村里流传着一只歌谣说：“公粮公粮轻，评议又公又认真。咱们大家翻了身，交点公粮表表心！”
    【长治二十八日电】昔阳三教河村劳动英雄张太小，在今年大生产运动中，积极帮助群众发家，更为该村群众所爱戴。张太小所领导的拨工大队，团结巩固，是该县的模范拨工队，参加的每一农户均能认识组织互助的好处，积极生产。拨工队成为大家的依靠。该队四十四户，一百八十二人，今春下种前，张太小领导大家每人上山砍树把三天，运往元氏南佐镇即换回食盐二千斤，解决了全队今年吃盐的问题。两年来该队大部生产发家，全队仅余六户贫农，张太小今年即发动全队帮助他们发家，保证在今年内使他们完全上升为中农。他们为郑存贵开荒五亩，为眭成喜互助砍山货，运输赚洋五千元买坡地八亩，张太小并将今春贩牛所赚六千元借出为其余几户买地，另外还帮助他们养猪。该村群众说：“咱们翻身是有了共产党和毛主席，但直接领导咱翻身的是张太小。”
