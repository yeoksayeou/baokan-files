Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. August 14th is Chinese Air Force Day. Liu Shanben, former captain of the Eighth Air Force Squadron, Zhang Shouyi, captain, and air force personnel Tang Shihui, Tang Yuwen, He Huiting, Jiang Huanzhang, and Li Rongchen, who flew to Yan'an to oppose the civil war, are preparing for a commemoration and issuing an "Air Force Day Declaration." The declaration recounts the heroic deeds of Chinese Air Force personnel in the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and denounces the Kuomintang reactionaries for launching a civil war to slaughter the people and sell out national sovereignty by relying on aircraft and weapons supplied by the United States. They tell the air force personnel across the country: "We have been ordered by these warlords and bureaucrats to use American planes to transport military supplies and troops, and use American plane bombs, machine guns to directly bomb and strafe our own compatriots, and many air force colleagues have already sacrificed silently and ingloriously." "Now is the time for us to use our actions to show our knowledge! ... Be brave! We are waiting for you here!" The declaration concludes with a resounding call: Air Force friends across the country resolutely withdraw from the civil war! Demand that the United States respect Chinese sovereignty! Oppose the Kuomintang authorities' betrayal of national interests! The Air Force will not be the running dogs of bureaucrats and warlords! We are the armed forces of the country and the people! Defend our country's airspace! Oppose the use of American planes to bomb and strafe our own compatriots!
