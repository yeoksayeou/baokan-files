Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 27th—Education in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region has developed substantially. There are now 134 secondary and higher education institutions, with 26,100 students. During the Anti-Japanese War, the border region created the North China United University, the Anti-Japanese National Construction College, the Bethune Health School, and more than 20 middle schools, cultivating and supplying more than 46,000 outstanding cadres for the military, administrative, economic, literary, educational, and other fronts. After the victory against Japan, in order to meet the needs of democratic construction, democratic governments at all levels established more secondary and higher education institutions. To date, there are a total of 67 secondary and higher education institutions in the entire border region, with more than 13,000 students; universities and specialized schools have reached 14, with 3,840 students; vocational schools number 5, with 913 students; middle schools number 30, with 6,225 students; and normal schools number 18, with 2,123 students. Advanced schools such as North China United University, Bethune Medical University (established by merging Bethune School and China Medical University), Military Region Military and Political Cadre School, Border Region Administrative Cadre School, Railway College, Inner Mongolia College, Border Region Institute of Technology, Agricultural College, Commercial College, Jin-Dong National Construction College, Rehe Inner Mongolia College, Military and Political Cadre School, etc., mostly absorb various cadres with rich practical experience for further study. At the same time, young students from the Kuomintang-controlled areas such as Tianjin, Chongqing, and Shanghai are also very enthusiastic to enroll. Secondary education is generally divided into two types: cadre training and preparatory schooling. In addition to the government providing all expenses for the children of anti-Japanese soldiers and martyrs whose families are poor, or for young students from outside the liberated areas, a large number of self-funded students are also recruited. Normal education is generally divided into simple normal schools and ordinary normal schools. The former is run by each county to specialize in training primary school teachers; the latter is run by special commissioner's offices and above to train senior elementary school teachers and lower-level educational administrative cadres. In addition, each county uses teacher holidays to conduct short-term teacher training courses. In the Jin-Ji area, more than 5,500 teachers have been trained in half a year.
