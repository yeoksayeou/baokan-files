　　Regulations on Protecting National Industry
    Deeply Welcomed by Zhangjiakou Industrialists
    [Zhangjiakou, 11th Dispatch] Industrialists in Zhangjiakou are extremely pleased with the "Regulations on Protecting and Developing National Industry" promulgated by the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Government. On the evening of the 7th, over a hundred factory managers, technicians, and others from various industries in Zhangjiakou gathered at the Municipal Government Club to discuss issues related to industrial development and construction. Mayor Yang Chunpu and others were present to listen. Shan Yongmao, manager of Deshenghua Fur Company, cited facts to illustrate that, with the support of loans and marketing assistance from the democratic government, the number of wool and leather manufacturers in Zhangjiakou had rapidly recovered from over twenty to over one hundred in the past six months. He suggested that, in order to rationally utilize the abundant local wool production, a large-scale mechanized wool weaving factory should be jointly established by both public and private sectors. Zhang Ji, manager of the Peace Construction Company, stated that, because the liberated areas' market was not flooded with foreign goods and people's purchasing power was very strong, the development of national industry became possible. The factory had successfully trial-produced a battery, producing 500 barrels of dry cell batteries, 200 cylinders of communication batteries, and 20 large barrels of radio batteries daily, which still could not meet the demand. In contrast, the few battery factories in cities like Peiping and Tianjin had almost all closed down due to the dumping of American goods. Manager Li of Yu@ Flour Company reported that the factory's monthly machine-milled flour production had now increased to over 12,000 bags, and they planned to expand operations to over 20,000 bags soon. He felt greatly encouraged by the various excellent measures taken by the democratic government to protect and develop national industry. Other textile, hardware, and other industry representatives offered insightful suggestions on how industry could serve the vast rural areas and achieve prosperity and development.

　　保护民族工业条例            
    深受张市实业界欢迎
    【张家口十一日电】张市实业界人士，对晋察冀边区政府公布的保护与发展民族工业条例均极欢迎。七日晚，张市各界工厂经理技师等一百余人齐集市府俱乐部，座谈有关发展工业建设诸问题，杨春圃市长等均列席旁听，皮裘业德盛华号经理单永茂，引证事实说明在民主政府贷款供销等扶助下，半年来张市毛革制造业已由二十余家迅速恢复至一百余家，并建设为合理使用当地盛产的羊毛，应由公私共同筹办一大规模的机器毛织工厂。和平建设公司张吉经理称：由于解放区市场没有外货充斥，人民购买力极旺，使民族工业发展成为可能，该厂试验制造一电池已经成功，日产手电池五百桶、通讯用圆电池二百筒、无线电用方电池二十大桶，仍供不应求，反观平津等城市仅有的几家电池制造厂，在美货倾销下，几已全部倒闭。钰＠面粉公司李经理，报告该厂每月机器面产量现已增加至一万二千余袋，最近拟扩大经营提高至二万余袋。因为民主政府保护与发展民族工业的种种优良措施，给了他极大鼓励。其他纺织五金等工业界人士，对工业如何为广大农村服务，以获得繁荣发展等，均有精辟建议。
