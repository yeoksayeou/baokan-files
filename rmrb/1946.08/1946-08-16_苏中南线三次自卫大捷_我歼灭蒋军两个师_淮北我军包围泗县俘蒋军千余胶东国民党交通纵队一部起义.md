Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Front, 13th: The New Fourth Army in central Jiangsu has annihilated two more divisions of Chiang's invading army in the self-defense battle east of Hai'an. After Chiang's army occupied Hai'an on the night of the 2nd of this month (referring to Chen Cheng's so-called "change of defense" and "adjustment" of the Yangzhou-Hai'an line), they further increased their troops and continued to invade eastward, dragging the New 7th Division (now reorganized as a brigade) of the Songhu Garrison into the battle. From the 6th to the 8th, they successively occupied Xichang, Dingjiashuo, Libao, Jiaoxie, and other towns east and northeast of Hai'an, ravaging the near-sea area of more than eighty li east-west and more than twenty li north-south from Hai'an town. A part of the New Fourth Army launched a counterattack at 12:00 PM on the 10th, and the battle ended at 6:00 PM on the 11th. It is estimated that the entire New 7th Division of the 11th Army (now renamed as a division) and most of the 105th Division (now renamed as a brigade) of the 49th Army (now renamed as a division) were annihilated (lacking one regiment). According to preliminary statistics, more than 5,000 Chiang's troops were captured, more than 3,000 were killed or wounded, and the seized items are being inventoried. The New Fourth Army immediately recovered Lifaqiao (nine li east of Hai'an) and all the occupied towns east of it. This is the third annihilating blow to the invading Chiang's army by the New Fourth Army guarding the southern line of central Jiangsu. The previous two times were the Taixing Campaign and the southern suburb of Rugao campaign in the middle and late last month. In these two campaigns, a total of approximately 20,000 Chiang's troops were annihilated, including the direct subordinate team of the 49th Army headquarters and the entire 26th Division, one regiment of the 79th Division, the entire 19th Division of the 100th Army, and one battalion of the 99th Division of the 99th Army (after the "reorganization" of Chiang's army, the armies were renamed divisions, and the divisions were renamed brigades). When invading Hai'an, Chiang's army also suffered more than 3,000 casualties. So far, the invading Chiang's army in Jiangsu and Anhui has lost more than 31,000 officers and soldiers on the southern line of central Jiangsu alone, and the three divisions of the 49th Army under Wang Tiehan have almost been completely destroyed. However, the Central News Agency has remained silent about the above three major setbacks of Chiang's army in the offensive and has tried its best to cover them up to prevent military morale from shaking.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Huaihai Front, 11th: The Central China New Fourth Army recovered Pingshan, Laoshan, Changzhigou, and other places in Si County yesterday, eliminating three battalions of Chiang's army. The 7th Army of Chiang's army, which invaded eastward along the Jinpu Railway, occupied Lingbi, Wuhe, Si County, and other places in the Huaihai liberated area in late last month and continued to invade. A unit of the New Fourth Army launched a self-defense counterattack on the 7th, and after four days of combat, by the 10th, the three battalions of Chiang's army occupying Pingshanji (20 li north of Si County, occupied on July 29th), Laoshanji, and Changzhigou (more than 20 li northwest of Si County, occupied on July 26th) were completely annihilated, and a part of the Chiang's army reinforcements south of Si County were eliminated. In this battle, more than 1,000 Chiang's troops were captured, and the results are being inventoried. So far, the Chiang's army, which occupied Si County on the 27th of last month, has been heavily surrounded, and the New Fourth Army is urging it to lay down its arms voluntarily.

Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 13th: More than 400 men of the 1st Battalion of the 15th Transportation Column of the Kuomintang at Nanquan Station (40 li west of Jimo City) on the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, led by Battalion Commander Wang Yifen, staged an anti-civil war uprising on the afternoon of the 10th of this month due to their dislike of the civil war. They have entered the Eighth Route Army's garrison amidst the warm welcome of the military and civilians in the liberated area. The 13th and 15th Transportation Columns were shipped to Qingdao successively on July 2nd and 15th under the command of Chiang Kai-shek (each column had more than 1,000 men, all equipped with American weapons) to cooperate with the 54th Army of Chiang's army in invading westward along the Jiaoji Railway, controlling transportation, and attacking the liberated area. However, many conscious lower-level officers and the vast majority of soldiers were unwilling to be meaningless victims of the civil war.

　　苏中南线三次自卫大捷
    我歼灭蒋军两个师
    淮北我军包围泗县俘蒋军千余胶东国民党交通纵队一部起义
    【新华社苏中前线十三日电】苏中新四军在海安以东自卫战中，又歼灭进犯蒋军两个师。本月二日夜，蒋军侵占海安（即陈诚所谓“改守”“调整”后之扬州海安一线）后，复增调大军继续东犯，将淞沪警备部队二十一军新七师（现改成旅）亦拖入战斗，于六日至八日连续侵占海安以东与东北之西场、丁家所、李堡、角斜等镇，几使海安镇东西八十余里、南北二十余里之近海地区遭受蹂躏。新四军一部乃于十日晚十二时开始反击，激战至十一日午后六时结束战斗。计歼灭蒋军第十一军（现改称师）新七师全部及四十九军（现改称师）一○五师（现改称旅）大部（缺一个团）。据初步统计，共俘蒋军五千余人，毙伤约三千余人，缴获正清查中。新四军当即收复立发桥（海安东九里）及其以东全部被占市镇。按此为守卫苏中南线新四军对进犯蒋军之第三次歼灭打击。前二次为上月中旬至下旬之泰兴战役与如皋南郊战役，该两役共计歼灭蒋军四十九军军部直属队及二十六师全部、七十九师的一个团、一百军十九师全部及九九军九九师（以上蒋军在“整编”后，军改称师、师改称旅）一个营，共约二万人。在侵夺海安时，蒋军伤亡亦在三千人以上。至此进攻苏皖蒋军，仅苏中南线损失官兵即在三万一千人以上，而四十九军王铁汉部之三个师几已全军覆没，但中央社对上述三次蒋军在进攻中之重大挫折，始终默不作声，并尽力掩饰以防军心动摇。
    【新华社淮北前线十一日电】华中新四军于昨日收复泗县之屏山、姥山、长直沟等地，消灭蒋军三个营。沿津浦路东犯之蒋军第七军，于上月下旬分路侵占淮北解放区灵壁、五河、泗县等地后，仍继续进犯不已，新四军某部于七日起举行自卫反击，经四日作战，至十日将侵占屏山集（泗县北二十里，七月二十九日被占）姥山集、长直沟（泗县西北二十余里，七月二十六日被占）等地蒋军三个营全部歼灭，并于泗县城南歼灭增援之蒋军一部。是役共俘蒋军千余名，战果正清查中。至此于上月二十七日占据泗县城内之蒋军，已陷入重围，新四军正促其自动放下武器。
    【新华社莱阳十三日电】胶济路东段南泉车站（即墨城西四十里）之国民党交通第十五纵队第一大队四百余人，厌弃内战，在大队长王一芬率领下，于本月十日下午举行反内战起义，已在解放区军民热烈欢迎声中开入八路军驻地。交通第十三、十五两纵队系在蒋介石驱使下于七月二日十五日先后海运至青岛（每纵队千余人全系美械装备），以配合蒋军五十四军沿胶济线西犯，控制交通，对解放区之进攻。但其中部分有觉悟的下级军官及广大士兵多不愿作内战的无谓牺牲品。
