Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 23rd: According to a Reuters dispatch from London on August 20th: British whaling industrialists have lodged a serious protest regarding MacArthur's arbitrary agreement allowing a large Japanese whaling fleet to operate in the Arctic. An industry leader stated, "If the Japanese whaling fleet goes out, it will mean the transfer of thousands of tons of whale oil to Japan. Whale oil is extremely important in European food, and especially for Britain in its fat and artificial cheese rations." This protest was submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Foreign Office, and it is expected that a note will be sent to Washington. United Press, in reporting the same event, stated: MacArthur's permission for the Japanese whaling fleet to operate will not only be opposed by Britain, but also by Norway and other whaling nations. It also said: At the last Allied Council for Japan meeting, British representative Ball asked why the committee was not consulted in advance regarding allowing Japan to fish? He fundamentally did not understand and pointed out that the committee only discussed allowing Japan to expand its fishing activities in certain seas, but did not discuss allowing Japan to make whaling expeditions thousands of miles from its homeland.

　　麦克阿瑟擅允日本北极猎鲸
    英国向美提出抗议
    【新华社延安二十三日电】据路透社伦敦二十日电：英国猎鲸业家就麦克阿瑟擅自答应日本巨大猎鲸船队出动北极事提出严重抗议，工业界某领袖称：“如果日本猎鲸队出动，将意味着成千吨鲸油的转运日本。鲸油在欧洲的食物中极为重要，对于英国在其脂肪与人造乳酪的配给中尤为重要”。此一抗议系由农业与渔业部提交外交部，预料将向华盛顿提出照会。合众社在报导同一事件时称：麦克阿瑟的允许日捕鲸队出动，不仅引起英国反对，也将遭到挪威及其他捕鲸国家的反对。又称：上次盟国对日委员会上英代表波尔曾称允许日本捕鱼事，事前为什么不与委员会磋商？他根本不了解并指出委员会上仅讨论过在某些海面上允许日本扩大其捕鱼活动，但未讨论允许日本在其本土数千英里外作捕鲸远征。
