Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, August 14th: The people along the northern section of the Tongpu Railway are enthusiastically assisting the Eighth Route Army in the self-defense war. During the liberation of Dai and Guo counties, every day there were groups of 300 to 400 stretchers spontaneously gathered by the masses moving along with the troops, and at most, more than 1,000 stretchers were concentrated. During the liberation of Fanshi, more than 1,500 militiamen from the newly liberated areas rushed to the front line overnight, climbing up the city walls on cloud ladders together with the main force, personally capturing the traitors who had oppressed and ravaged them. Transportation stations were set up every fifty li in various places, and as soon as the wounded arrived, they were transferred in relays day and night. Countless temporary comfort stations were also established in various large and small villages and towns. When the stretchers arrived, women and children waiting by the village would scramble to stuff eggs, pancakes, and cigarettes to the wounded soldiers, and deliver soup and water to wash their faces and hands. Little girl Han Fengxiang's father was captured and buried alive in the city by the puppet bandit Qiao Richeng in May of this year. She used her private money to buy many cigarettes and eggs and put them in her pockets, waiting all day long by the village to comfort the passing wounded soldiers, and automatically changing medicine for them.

　　同蒲路北段人民热烈协助自卫战
    【新华社张家口十四日电】同蒲路北段人民，热情协助八路军进行自卫战，解放代、崞两县时，每日均有群众自动集拢起的三四百付担架随车移动，最多时曾集中到一千多付。解放繁峙时，新解放区民兵一千五百余名，彻夜赶赴前线，和主力一同攀登云梯上城，亲手捕捉欺压蹂躏他们的奸逆。各地每隔五十里均设有交通站，伤兵一到立刻不分昼夜递次转送。各大小村镇，更成立了无数的临时慰劳站，当担架到时，聚集在村边等候的妇女儿童，便争先将鸡蛋、烙饼、纸烟塞给伤兵们，并递汤喂水给伤兵洗脸洗手。小姑娘韩凤祥的父，是今年五月被伪匪乔日成捕入城内活埋的，他用体己钱买了许多纸烟、鸡蛋放在口袋里，终日在村边上等候着慰劳过路伤员，并自动为伤兵换药。
