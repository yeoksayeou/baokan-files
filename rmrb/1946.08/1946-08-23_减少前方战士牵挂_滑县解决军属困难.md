Reducing Worries of Frontline Soldiers
Huaxian Solves Difficulties of Military Families
[Heze News from this Newspaper] Huaxian County has launched a campaign to solve the difficulties of poor military families to support the patriotic war. Many landlords and rich peasants have voluntarily donated land, houses, etc., to poor military families. Many village cadres, militiamen, and members of farmers' associations have reflected on their past insufficient care for military families and apologized to the military families. In Xizhong and Liangcun villages in the Sixth District, there are 180 households, including 32 military families (with 184 people and 689 mu of land). Ten landlord and rich peasant households in the village voluntarily donated 185 mu of land, over 70,000 bricks and tiles, 1,500 square rafters, and 150 timbers, increasing the average land per military family member to over 4 mu and resolving the difficulty of repairing houses after the autumn harvest. In addition, over 300 mu of land belonging to military families lacking labor needs to be cultivated on their behalf. The whole village organized labor and livestock into shifts and groups for cultivation, ensuring that the grain harvest of military families is no less than that of the general population. Some villages have too many military families, and their difficulties cannot be fully resolved within the village. Neighboring villages have launched a loving mutual assistance movement. The × village landlords donated 447 mu of land, 16 shi of autumn grain, 34 high houses, and 74 tile houses to military families, increasing the average land per military family member to over 7 mu, allowing them to live in good houses. The soldiers are also very excited. A soldier from Nantun in the Sixth District who returned home to visit his family said: "This time, I will not return home until I defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive because I don't need to worry about my family anymore."
