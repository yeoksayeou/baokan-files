　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 24th: Chongqing report: Following the illegal seizure of the Labor Association here by the Kuomintang authorities, protests from Chinese and foreign figures have erupted. The chairman of the British Trades Union Congress, Mr. Citrine, recently sent a telegram to the Labor Association expressing concern and sympathy. Mr. Green, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the American Federation of Labor, recently announced the details of this incident to the Executive Committee and, on the 15th, requested the US State Department to investigate the truth of the Kuomintang government's ban on labor organizations' activities. Mr. Xiong Foxi, a famous Chinese playwright, stated: "The illegal seizure of the Labor Association is a great disgrace to China. The people of the whole country must unite to protest!" Chongqing literary critic Feng Naichao said: "This is not accidental. In the Jiaochangkou incident, members of the Labor Association were also beaten. Obviously, in the struggle between democracy and anti-democracy, the Labor Association is engaged in the labor movement from a democratic standpoint, and the cultural circles should support it."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Shanghai report: After the incident of the Kuomintang authorities forcibly occupying the Chongqing Labor Association, Shanghai workers rose up to express their support. On the 10th and 11th alone, more than 100 units, including the Electric Power Company Union, the Waterworks Union, and the Bakery Union, sent letters to the Labor Association headquarters to express their condolences. The Third District Machinery Industry Union of Shanghai and the Shanghai West Workers' Welfare Committee sent letters to Zhu Xuefan on behalf of tens of thousands of members to express their condolences and stated their willingness to support the Labor Association and fight for the freedom of workers' organizations. Upon learning that the Shanghai Labor Association representatives were going to Beijing to petition, the trade unions in various districts and the trade unions of major newspaper enterprises jointly sent letters to the association on the 14th to express their support. Unemployed workers' representatives from various places coming to Shanghai and the China Workers' Weekly also hosted journalists and cultural figures on the 10th and 14th respectively, calling on the cultural circles to unite with the workers and strive for democracy and freedom. After learning that the Chongqing Labor Association had been forcibly occupied, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions also sent five representatives to express their condolences to the Labor Association. Dozens of journalists jointly sent a letter to the Labor Association, expressing their serious protest against the special agents' destruction of the labor movement.
