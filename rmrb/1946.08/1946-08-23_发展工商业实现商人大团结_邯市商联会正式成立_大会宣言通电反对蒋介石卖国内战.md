　　Develop Industry and Commerce, Achieve Great Unity of Merchants
　　Handan City Federation of Commerce Formally Established
　　General Assembly Declaration Cables Opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's Selling-Out and Civil War

　　[Report from this newspaper in Handan] The Federation of Commerce of Handan City, representing 37 trades, more than 1,700 businesses, and over a thousand vendors in Handan's commercial sector, was formally established on the 18th after three months of preparation and free, unconstrained democratic elections. Mr. Wang Gengwu, manager of Yu Sheng He, a general merchandise store in Nanguan, praised this bottom-up, free election as the first of its kind in Handan's commercial sector. The inaugural meeting was held at the Handan Theater. On that day, businesses throughout Handan commonly hung national flags, and merchants at the crossroads of the assembly site voluntarily erected arches conspicuously displaying slogans like "Great Unity of Merchants." The 165 representatives in attendance included small merchants, small vendors, large capitalists, public stores, and private stores from all commercial sectors. Despite their different businesses and varying capital sizes, they all stood united on equal footing, electing their common leadership group—the Federation of Commerce—by secret ballot. Mr. Li Jirui, Mr. Wang Gengwu, and Mr. Zhang Jutian, the most reputable merchants, were elected as the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Federation. At the meeting, Mayor Wang, representing the government, congratulated the establishment of the Handan City Federation of Commerce, praising it as a new flower added to Handan's democratic construction. The shop employees' union also specially dispatched its representative, Gao Jinglu, to offer congratulations, hoping that the Federation of Commerce and the shop employees' union could unite and develop together in the future. Mr. Wang Mingke, representing all the merchants of the city, delivered a very emotional speech, saying: Today, we merchants can obtain democracy and freedom because of the support and leadership of the democratic government. He expressed his hope that the Federation of Commerce would lead the merchants to resolutely implement the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies. Finally, the General Assembly unanimously passed a declaration and telegram against the civil war, calling on all merchants in the border region to unite, resolutely oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' selling-out and civil war, actively support the patriotic self-defense war, develop industry and commerce in the liberated areas, resist comprador-bureaucrat capital and imperialist economic aggression, boycott American goods, advocate the use of local goods, develop handicrafts, organize transportation cooperative enterprises, stabilize prices, and welcome industrialists, business people, and unemployed merchants from the Kuomintang-controlled areas to operate and invest in the liberated areas.
