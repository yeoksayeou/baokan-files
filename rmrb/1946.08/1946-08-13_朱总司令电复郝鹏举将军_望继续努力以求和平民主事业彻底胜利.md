Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. Commander-in-Chief Zhu telegraphed yesterday in reply to General Hao Pengju of the Democratic Allied Army of Jiangsu and Shandong. The original telegram is as follows:

General Pengju,
I was deeply impressed after reading your public announcement against dictatorship and civil war! Peace and democracy are the common path for the whole world and all of China, and also the common path for all armies and all soldiers in China. The general trend is inevitable, and the people's hearts are what we aim for. All who support peace and democracy will surely win, and all who insist on dictatorship and civil war will surely fail. Your courageous action in speaking out is a beacon of light for the armies forced into civil war today. I hope you will continue to work hard to achieve the complete victory of the cause of peace and democracy!

Zhu De, August 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi County, 8th. The uprising of General Hao Pengju's Sixth Route Army of the Kuomintang, consisting of more than 20,000 people, is as follows:

In January of this year, on the eve of the Political Consultative Conference held by the Kuomintang reactionaries in Chongqing, they gathered the 33rd Army Group of Feng Zhi'an, the 6th Route Army of Hao Pengju, and the 117th Division, the 8th Division, and the Weng Wenqing Column under the command of Chen Daqing, a total of ten divisions, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, and advanced northwards into the liberated areas of southern Shandong in three routes, occupying Hanzhuang and other places liberated by the Eighth Route Army from the enemy and puppet forces. The Eighth Route Army endured for the sake of the country, retreated step by step, and advised all officers and soldiers of the attacking forces, requesting them to consider the importance of national peace, democracy, and unity, and to immediately refuse the orders for civil war. On January 9th, General Hao Pengju of the Sixth Route Army, on the left flank of the Kuomintang attacking army, deeply understood righteousness and responded to the call of the military and civilians of the liberated areas, leading all of his officers and soldiers, more than 20,000 people, to stage an uprising on the front line of Taierzhuang, withdraw from the civil war, and stand on the side of the people. The entire army, through public discussion by all officers and soldiers, changed its name to the Democratic Allied Army, and unanimously elected General Hao Pengju as the commander-in-chief. On the same day, they issued a declaration withdrawing from the civil war and supporting democracy, denouncing the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to launch a civil war to eliminate dissidents, and the entire army vowed to fight to the end to achieve peace and democracy.

On January 21st, General Hao Pengju issued his thoughts on the uprising to reporters, elaborating on the purpose and course of the uprising, saying: "I served in the Kuomintang army at the beginning of the War of Resistance, participated in military affairs, and was ordered to lead troops in and out of the Central Plains front line of the War of Resistance, advocating to attack the enemy with all our strength to reverse the defeat. However, it was contrary to the authorities' policy of eliminating dissidents, the so-called 'two wars, one fight', so I was not tolerated by those in power, and was forced to leave and go into the enemy's rear alone, wanting to make some achievements. Unexpectedly, things went against my wishes, and I became a prisoner of the enemy. At that time, my heart was torn and my five internal organs were burning. I wanted to kill myself to end my life, but then I thought that the national hatred had not been avenged, and it would be useless to die. Moreover, I did not realize the fallacy of the Kuomintang authorities' so-called 'curved line of saving the country in the enemy's rear' which was raging at the time, and I endured humiliation, superficially dealing with the enemy, waiting for the opportunity to avenge the country. Unexpectedly, Japan surrendered and there was no time to explain. I intended to strictly supervise my troops, awaiting punishment from the country, and waiting for a public decision. Who knew that I would receive orders from the Kuomintang authorities to reorganize my troops into the Sixth Route Army and conduct a civil war, which is the most painful thing in the world! The entire army and soldiers were unwilling to make another mistake, so they resolutely held an uprising on January 9th at the Taierzhuang military camp."

General Hao then bitterly denounced the fact that the Kuomintang reactionaries used and forced miscellaneous troops to conduct civil war, saying: "The Kuomintang reactionaries' forcing miscellaneous troops to conduct civil war has been obvious to all. Taking this army as an example, on August 10th last year, the day after Japan announced its surrender, it received an order from the Kuomintang authorities to be reorganized into the Sixth Route Army, forcing the army to maintain local security and not allowing it to disarm the troops behind enemy lines; at the same time, the Japanese army also received an order from the Kuomintang authorities to be responsible for assisting in maintaining local security. This was the first step of the Kuomintang reactionaries in launching a civil war. Then we received the so-called 'suppression of the Communists' order. The military reorganization conference held by the Kuomintang authorities was actually a conference to launch a civil war. At the meeting, the Kuomintang reactionaries conspired to provoke a third world war, singing high praises for anti-Sovietism. In foreign policy, a small number of reactionaries colluded with each other to threaten the Soviet Union with American atomic bombs; domestically, they gathered all armed forces and carried out a full-scale civil war, attempting to eliminate the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which had made meritorious contributions in the War of Resistance, and using all miscellaneous troops as tools and victims for their civil war. Therefore, this army was also forced to attack the liberated areas of southern Shandong. Every attack by this army had received a formal order from the Kuomintang authorities in advance. All these facts can be found as ironclad evidence in the orders given to this army by the Kuomintang authorities."

　　朱总司令电复郝鹏举将军            
    望继续努力以求和平民主事业彻底胜利
    【新华社延安十日电】朱总司令于昨日复电苏鲁民主联军郝鹏举将军，原电如下：
    鹏举将军勋鉴：接读反对独裁内战通电，至深钦佩！和平民主为全世界全中国之同一道路，亦为全中国一切军队一切军人之同一道路，大势所趋，人心所向。凡拥护和平民主者必然胜利，凡坚持独裁内战者必然失败。将军见义勇为，振臂高呼，实为今日被迫内战之军队指一光明前途，尚望继续努力，以求和平民主事业之彻底胜利！朱德，八月九日。
    【新华社临沂县八日电】国民党第六路军郝鹏举将军所部二万余人起义经过如下：
    今年一月国民党反动派于重庆召开政协会前夕，曾纠集三十三集团军冯治安部、第六路军郝鹏举部、及陈大庆所指挥之一一七师、八师、翁文庆纵队，共十师兵力，在飞机大炮掩护下，分三路北犯鲁南解放区，侵占八路军从敌伪手中解放之韩庄等地，八路军相忍为国，步步退让，并向进攻之各官兵进行劝告，请其体念国家和平民主团结之重要，立即拒绝内战命令。一月九日国民党进攻军之左翼第六路军郝鹏举将军，深明大义，响应解放区军民之号召，率所属全体官兵二万余人，于台儿庄前线举行起义，退出内战，站到人民方面来。并由全体将士公议，易名为民主联军，公推郝鹏举将军为总司令，当于是日发表退出内战拥护民主宣言，痛斥国民党反动派发动内战消灭异己之阴谋，全军并誓为实现和平民主奋斗到底。
    一月二十一日，郝鹏举将军向记者发表起义感想，阐述起义宗旨及经过称：本人在抗战开始，曾服务于国民党军，参予军机，又受命统率部队出入中原抗战前线，力主以全力击敌，挽回败局，但与当局消灭异己之所谓“两次战争一次打”之政策相违，以致不见容于当道，被迫出走，孤身奔走敌后，欲有所建树，不意事与愿违，身为敌俘，当时椎心泣血，五脏如焚，每欲自戕以了此生，继思国仇未报，纵死无益。又不察鼎沸一时之国民党当局敌后曲线救国谬论之非，含垢忍辱，虚与敌寇委曲周旋，以待时机，得有以雪耻报国，不料日本投降，表白不及。自拟严督所部，待罪国家，听候公决，讵料又接获国民党当局命令，将本人部队编为第六路军，进行内战，天下痛心疾首之事，莫此为甚！全军将士不愿一误再误，乃决然于一月九日在台儿庄军次举行起义。
    郝将军继即痛陈国民党反动派利用与迫令杂牌军进行内战之事实称：国民党反动派迫令杂牌军进行内战，已为有目共睹之事，即以本军而论，去年八月十日日本宣布投降次日，即接获国民党当局命令，编为第六路军，迫令本军维持地方治安，不准向敌后部队缴械投降；同时日军亦接获国民党当局命令，负责协助维持地方治安。此为国民党反动派发动内战之第一步。接着我们又接到所谓“剿共”命令，国民党当局召开之整军会议，实际为发动内战的会议，在会议上国民党反动派曾阴谋挑起第三次世界大战，高唱反苏。在对外政策上，少数反动派勾通一气以美国原子炸弹威胁苏联；对内则集结一切武装力量，全力进行内战，企图消灭抗日有功之八路军新四军，并以一切杂牌部队为其进行内战之工具与牺牲品，因此本军亦被迫令向鲁南解放区进攻。本军的每次进攻，事先均曾接到国民党当局的正式命令，所有这些事实，均可从国民党当局给本军的命令中找到铁证。
