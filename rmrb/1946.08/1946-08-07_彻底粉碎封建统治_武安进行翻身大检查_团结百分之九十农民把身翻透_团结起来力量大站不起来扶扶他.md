　　Thoroughly Smash Feudal Rule
    Wu'an Conducts a Thorough Overhaul Examination
    Uniting Ninety Percent of Farmers to Thoroughly Turn Themselves Over
    "Unity is Strength, Help Those Who Can't Stand Up"
    [Reported by this newspaper] More than a thousand land reform heroes, activists, and model cadres from 109 villages in Wu'an County's seven new districts gathered in late July in the county town and various districts to hold meetings. Based on Chairman Mao's spirit in "On Coalition Government" regarding land reform and Sun Yat-sen's "Land to the Tiller" ideal, they conducted a county-wide thorough overhaul examination. Since the beginning of summer, mass movements throughout the county have achieved significant results in the comprehensive and in-depth movement. However, due to insufficient leadership in guiding activists to lead the masses, and in enabling intermediate and backward elements to consciously take action, a complacent attitude of "good enough" arose, believing that no further large-scale struggles were possible. Furthermore, the county was preparing for self-defense, leading to the stagnation or interruption of mass movements in many villages. In the ten villages of Boyan, Tonghui, and Longquan in the Third District, which were said to have deep movements, the farmers' accounting and struggle against 48 large and medium landlords were not thorough. The large landlord in Tonghui still possessed a lot of land, while more than 40 poor farmers had not yet obtained any. In Cuilu Village in the Tenth District, more than 90 farmer households had only an average of one or two mu of land per household. In Wuji Village in the Second District, the vice chairman of the Farmers' Association who led the farmers to turn themselves over had not yet fully expressed his suffering or received any land. Many masses groaning under the oppression of landlords, bullies, and traitorous spies had not yet been fully mobilized. In Yuquanling Village, which was holding a meeting to discuss turning themselves over, farmer Wang Kaitai, whose house collapsed due to heavy rain, anxiously ran home after being called by his children. These facts reminded many activists that after eight months of the land reform movement, they still did not have a house or were living in dilapidated houses. Meanwhile, landlords like Wang Damaizi, a large landlord in Chengguan First Street, still possessed more than two hundred or hundreds of good houses. After the examination, everyone became clear-headed and began to investigate why they hadn't thoroughly turned themselves over. They then discovered that many village cadres and masses had the idea of "not wanting land," mistakenly believing the rumors spread by spies: fearing that they would be struggled against again if they had land, not understanding the democratic government's burden policies, fearing burdens, fearing a change of regime, and even developing lazy thoughts, saying, "The Communist Party won't let anyone starve to death, what do we need land for," waiting for grain after the autumn harvest. Some cadres were threatened, lured, and deceived by spies and landlords, and protected landlords. The militia captain of Chewangkou in the Third District was controlled by the landlord, and the militiamen he developed were all small landlords. When the Farmers' Association held meetings, he would lead the militia to disband the association. Due to inappropriate distribution of the fruits of struggle, troublemakers and bad elements provoked disunity among cadres and the masses, among cadres themselves, and among various organizational systems. The funds from the struggle in Longquan are still piled up in the Farmers' Association. All these stumbling blocks hindering the land reform were examined. Immediately, a heated discussion was held on how to thoroughly turn themselves over. Liu Ronghe, the more than fifty-year-old chairman of the Farmers' Association in Nanyingjing in the Fifth District, recalled his years of suffering as a hired laborer, saying: "We shouldn't forget the pain once the knife is put away. We worked hard all our lives in the past, wasn't it all for two mu of land? But I suffered for one or two decades, sweating and crying, year after year, from the fields to carrying water and sweeping the yard, suffering to death and still being a pauper! Now that the Communist Party is leading us to turn ourselves over, if we don't want to thoroughly turn ourselves over, if we don't want to farm, we'll still end up with nothing in the end. The land is clean but the clothes are torn, and we'll still be hungry after working as a day laborer!" These words stirred up the more than three hundred people present, who resolved to go back and thoroughly turn themselves over. A primary school teacher from Shangzhuang in the Fourth District, who actively helped farmers to turn themselves over, said: "The landlords in our village all say they have been overthrown, but they are still running coal mines, secretly inviting bad cadres to eat eggs and drink wine at night, spreading rumors about a change of regime, and preparing to counterattack. We must thoroughly settle accounts with them, and after overturning the 'stone slab,' we must smash it, otherwise it will press down on us again!" Each district proposed that the standard for turning themselves over was: "Having a house and land, having food and clothing, everything from head to toe belonging to oneself." To expand the Farmers' Association organization, leaving no backward villages or backward people, they proposed: "Hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants are one family. We have neither horses nor sedans to ride. Unity is strength for turning ourselves over." "Help the backward villages, and help those who can't stand up." Truly "everyone opens their mouths, and everyone benefits." The distribution of the fruits of struggle should take into account various different situations, help orphans, widows, and the helpless poor to establish cooperatives and build homes, and cadres and the masses should unite well and support and love each other. "Don't stab yourselves in the leg with a knife," help cadres change their work style, and "share blessings and gain both fame and fortune," clearly recognizing: "Corruption, bribery, and being deceived leads to losing face, wealth, and power." "Exploitation and getting rich is not a long-term solution, but the poor turning themselves over will last for ten thousand years." Land reform is a life-and-death struggle, and should be "merciless towards the enemy, and treating diseases and saving people internally." Go back to each village and launch a thorough overhaul examination, immediately expand the farmers' camp and launch a fierce and comprehensive advance against the feudal rulers, launch a land reform competition, unite ninety percent of the farmers to thoroughly turn themselves over, and follow Chairman Mao! They also proposed four things to not be afraid of: first, not being afraid of being sorry to the landlords; second, not being afraid of landlords pretending to be poor and scolding; third, not being afraid of a change of regime and being struggled against again; and fourth, not being afraid of middle peasants lagging behind. The meeting successfully concluded on the afternoon of the first of this month. Encouraged by the unity and victory, everyone braved the torrential rain and embarked on their journey home. When parting, everyone cheered, "The sooner we do it thoroughly, the sooner we benefit, land reform and self-defense is a good time!" (Yifan)

　　彻底粉碎封建统治
    武安进行翻身大检查
    团结百分之九十农民把身翻透
    “团结起来力量大站不起来扶扶他”
    【本报讯】武安县七个新区一百零九村的翻身英雄、积极分子与模范干部等千余人，七月下旬分别在县城及各区举行集会，根据毛主席“论联合政府”中土地改革及孙中山先生“耕者有其田”的精神，进行全县翻身大检查。入夏以来，全县群运在全面深入运动中，虽然获得显著成绩，但由于领导上对于积极分子领导群众运动到中间分子与落后分子自觉起来行动认识不足，认为不可能再有更大规模的斗争，产生了“差不多”的自满思想，加以全县准备自卫，不少村庄群运消沉或中断。三区伯延、同会、龙泉等十个号称运动深入的村庄，农民对四十八个大、中地主的算账斗争亦并不彻底。同会大地主仍拥有很多土地，而未获得土地的贫苦农民，则仍有四十多户。十区崔炉村有九十余户农民，平均每户只有一、二亩地。二区午汲村领导农民翻身的农会副主席，自己还没有诉尽痛苦，没有得到土地。许多呻吟在地主恶霸与汉奸特务压抑下的群众，还未充分发动起来。正在开会讨论翻身的玉泉岭村，农民王开太，因大雨淋塌房子被孩子召唤非常不安的跑回家去，这些事实引起许多积极分子回忆起自己翻身运动了八个月，连房子还没有，或住的破房子。而城关一街大地主王大麻子等拥有二百多间或百数十间好房子的地主，还到处存在着。经过检查，大家清醒了，纷纷追究为什么没有翻透身，于是发现不少村干部和群众存在“不愿要土地”的思想，误信特务造谣：怕有了土地再挨斗，不了解民主政府的负担政策，怕负担，怕变天，甚至产生懒汉思想，说“共产党不让饿死一个人，要土地干啥”，等着秋后要粮食。有的干部被特务地主威胁、利诱、欺骗，包庇地主。三区车辋口民兵队长被地主掌握在手里，发展民兵都是小地主，农会开会，他即带领民兵解散农会。由于分配果实不适当而被特务坏蛋挑拨，引起干部群众间、干部相互间、各组织系统间的不团结现象。龙泉斗争出来的款，现在还堆在农会里。凡此种种阻碍翻身的绊脚石，都被检讨出来。随即热烈进行如何才能翻透身的大讨论。五区南营井五十多岁的老农会主席刘荣和回忆自己多年当长工的痛苦说：“咱不要拔了刀子忘了痛，过去辛辛苦苦受一辈子，还不是为了二亩土，可是俺受了一二十年，汗一把、泪一把，一年到头，秋收冬藏，地里回来担水扫院，受死也还是一个穷光蛋！如今共产党领导咱翻身，还不想翻透，不想种地，赶后还是一场空，地净衣衫破，打罢短工还挨饿！”这一席话把三百多到会的人激动起来，决心回去翻个透身。四区上庄积极帮助农民翻身的小学教员说：“俺村地主，都说斗垮了，可是人家还开着大煤窑，黑夜偷请坏干部吃鸡蛋、喝酒，造谣变天，准备反攻，咱一定要和他彻底算账，掀了“石板”还要打碎它，不然会再压到头上来！”各区都纷纷提出翻身标准是：“有房有地，有吃有穿，头顶脚蹬都是自己。”要扩大农会组织，不留落后村，不留落后人，提出：“雇贫中农是一家，骑马坐轿都没有咱，团结翻身力量大。”“落后村帮一把，站不起来的，扶扶他。”真正“要大家张嘴，大家得利”。分配斗争果实要照顾各种不同情况，帮助孤寡无劳力的穷人成立合作社，建立家务，干部和群众团结好、拥干爱民，“不要拿起刀子往自己腿上扎”，帮助干部转变作风，要“有福同享，名利双全”，明确认识：“贪污受贿受欺骗，丢脸丢财又丢权。”“剥削发财不长远，穷人翻身万万年。”翻身是个生死斗争，应该是“对外你死我活，对内治病救人”，回去各村展开一个翻身大检查，立即扩大农民阵营猛烈地向封建统治者全面进军，发动翻身竞赛，团结百分之九十农民翻身翻透，跟上毛主席走！又提出四不怕：一不怕对不起地主，二不怕地主装穷叫骂，三不怕变天、再挨斗，四不怕中农落后。本月一日下午会议胜利结束，在团结胜利信心鼓舞下，大家冒着倾盆大雨，踏上归途，分别时，大家欢呼着“早搞彻底早沾光，翻身自卫好时光！”（一帆）
