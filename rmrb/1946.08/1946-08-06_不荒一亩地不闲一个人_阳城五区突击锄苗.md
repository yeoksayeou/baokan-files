　　Not an Acre Idle, Not a Person Unoccupied
    Yangcheng Fifth District Launches Emergency Weeding Campaign
    [Our Newspaper, Yangcheng News] This summer in Yangcheng, there has been continuous rain. In addition, the masses have gone to the front lines to participate in the war. In the Fifth District, out of the entire district's 100,000 mu of crops, more than 10,000 mu of cotton still needs weeding. At the production committee symposium on the 22nd of this month, everyone unanimously agreed that if the land cannot be weeded, and each mu yields one dou less, then more than 10,000 shi of grain will be lost; if each mu yields one jin less of cotton, then more than 10,000 jin will be lost. The district headquarters committee believes that this work is not simply a production task, but a concrete mission to support the front lines against the civil war. It specifically calls on all district cadres, male and female labor heroes, mutual aid group members, students, teachers, workers, merchants, and all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women to urgently mobilize and participate in the production front line of emergency weeding, implementing challenge competitions between villages, neighborhoods, groups, and individuals, and launching a large-scale emergency weeding campaign throughout the district. The district headquarters organized inspection teams to help mobilize in various villages. In order to boost production morale, they proposed: whichever village first completes weeding, guarantees no idle land, and punches the card, the district headquarters will present a large plaque of "Production Model Village," publish praise in the newspaper, and request the county government to issue a commendation. Their slogan is "Not an acre idle, not a person unoccupied, not a moment wasted, weeding one more seedling is better than weeding none." The production committee members of each village, after hearing this call, studied organizational mobilization methods and urgently returned to their villages to organize. Cadres in the Fifth District punched the card for weeding three mu of cotton during their lunch break. The masses in Liu Village said: "District cadres are not even resting at noon, so we should work even harder. We must respond to the call of the district headquarters and get the land weeded well in a short period of time." All villages are enthusiastically organizing and carrying out this work.

　　不荒一亩地不闲一个人
    阳城五区突击锄苗
    【本报阳城讯】阳城今夏雨水连绵，加以群众到前方参战，五区全区十万亩庄稼，一万多亩棉花尚有一部未锄。本月二十二日生产委员座谈会上大家都一致认为，如果不能把地锄了，以每亩地少收一斗计，就要少收一万多石粮食；一亩少收一斤花，就要少收一万多斤。区指挥部委员会认为这一工作不是单纯的生产工作，是支援前线反内战的具体任务。特号召全区干部、男女劳动英雄、互助组组员、学生教员、工人、商人、男女全半劳力，紧急动员起来一致参加到突击锄苗的生产战线上，实行村与村、闾与闾、组与组、人与人的挑战竞赛，掀起全区大规模的突击锄苗运动。并由区指挥部组织检查组，到各村帮助动员。为了提高生产情绪，提出：如那个村首先完成锄苗打卡保证一亩不荒者，区指挥部赠给“生产模范村”大匾一面，并登报表扬，呈请县府传令嘉奖。他们的口号是“不荒一亩地，不闲一个人，不误一点钟，多锄一苗顶一苗。”各村生产委员听了这个号召，研究了组织动员等办法，紧急的回村去组织。五区各干部在午睡时打卡棉花三亩。刘村群众说：“区干部都不歇晌午，咱们更要好好干。一定要响应区指挥部号召，在短期内把地锄好。”各村都在热烈组织进行这一工作。
