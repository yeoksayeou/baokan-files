　　The Soviet Union Shifts to Peaceful Production
    By William Mandel, USA
    During the war, Soviet doctors had to develop a sixth sense—a sense of temperature—because there were absolutely no thermometers outside of military hospitals. Now doctors can rely on science instead of instinct again. In the last three months of 1945, Soviet aircraft factories manufactured two million clinical thermometers. They also manufactured the same number of spoons, four million plates, 30,000 meat grinders, 30,000 children's sleds, 25,000 bicycles, 40,000 metal beds, 40,000 door locks, 25,000 teapots and coffee pots, and 200 cooking stoves—for housewives in cities without gas.

    If the Soviet Union's aircraft industry is smaller than that of the United States—although not as much smaller as generally believed—then their tank industry is much larger than that of the United States. The United States produced 17,000 tanks in 1944. The Soviet Union has not yet revealed its production figures, but one factory alone, moved to the Urals in the early years of the war, manufactured 18,000 sixty-ton tanks during the four years of the war. The United States did not produce this type of tank until the war was almost over. Another factory manufactured 35,000 medium tanks. Now it is manufacturing wheels and axles for railway cars. While the aircraft industry will continue to manufacture military and civilian aircraft, the tank industry has completely converted, even changing its name. It is now called the People's Commissariat of Transport Equipment. One large factory only produces passenger cars, while others will produce 250,000 freight cars this year.

    After the Five-Year Plan, when the factory in Gorky (on the Volga River) reaches 90,000 workers, it will then produce 300,000 vehicles per year, mainly trucks, 10% more than the total output of all Soviet factories in 1937.

    No industry is easy to convert, but textile factories only need to adjust from military to civilian requirements. But in southern Ukraine, the Soviet Union faces another major problem—reconstruction. The areas occupied by the German army, comprising 88 million people, had half of their power plants. In addition to carrying away about 14,000 furnaces, 1,400 turbines, and 11,300 generators, the Germans set fire to what remained. Finally, they effectively destroyed the Dnieper Dam, so that it will not be able to generate electricity until 1946, and it will take another three years to reach full production.

    Most of the equipment for the Dnieper Dam was made in the United States, but the power plant's output only reaches one-tenth of what was destroyed. What about the rest? During the war years, the Soviet Union installed new generating capacity equal to that of the entire Five-Year Plan period.

    Most of this energy comes from a factory called "Elektrosila." Its recovery represents the characteristic spirit of the Soviet Union today. It is a generator factory in Leningrad. For thirty months, from August 1941 to January 1944, its huge building, visible from the front lines, mocked the German besiegers in the trenches around the city. They knew it was being used for military production and repeatedly bombed and shelled it every day. Official reports indicated that the factory had been hit by hundreds of bombs and "thousands" of shells. It has only been two years since it was last shelled, but in 1945, it produced generating equipment with energy equal to the entire Dnieper Dam—the largest in Europe.

    Other factories in Leningrad also created similar miracles. The microscope is one of the most precise instruments. Its lenses, focus, and micrometers cannot have the slightest deviation. Its manufacturing requires the highest technical standards and precision. In 1945—one year after liberation from the siege—Leningrad manufactured 12,000 microscopes, enough to re-equip dozens of destroyed universities, and 1,500 movie projectors to bring a little entertainment to the lives of people in the devastated areas. Leningrad also has equipment for manufacturing radar, which was even a first for the Soviet Union.

    The manufacture of linotype machines is another of the most complex and sophisticated industries, including 6,500 parts, and requiring 20 special tools. One factory in Leningrad planned to manufacture 230 linotype machines in 1946, several times the equipment needed for the world's largest newspapers.

    Leningrad endured hunger and bombardment for two and a half years and was never actually occupied. Ukraine, however, was occupied. A small area of Ukraine, the Soviet Ruhr region, is a solid fortress of coal mines, steel mills, and factories. This is the Donbas. A large part of it is within the Stalin Oblast, which, with one-sixtieth of the Soviet population, produces 40% of the Soviet Union's coking coal, 40% of its salt, 30% of its coal and pig iron, and 23% of its steel. German demolition teams paid special attention to leaving nothing that could be used, and this area bore the brunt of it. When Soviet industrial experts followed the advancing troops into this area in September 1943 to conduct a survey, they were shocked. Ninety-nine and a half percent of the region's productive capacity had been destroyed or rendered inoperable.

    In July 1945—22 months after the region was liberated—the Soviet Union conducted another survey in Stalin Oblast. Machines were running all day, workers were pushing handcarts between the continuing bomb craters, and total production had reached 57% of pre-war levels. Heavy industry, requiring huge equipment, had not yet reached this level, but was also recovering. The production of pig iron and steel was slightly more than a quarter of normal levels. Factory engineers had accomplished an unprecedented feat: they raised entire blast furnaces and put them back on their foundations. Work in the coal mines was even better. Daily excavation was already two-fifths of pre-war levels because the Soviets knew how to drain the mines without using pumps.

    The full figures for Donbas coal mine production in the second half of 1945 are not yet available, but we know that from 1933 to 1937, over those five years, Soviet heavy machinery factories manufactured 64 mining cranes, giant heavy-tonnage elevators, and equipment with excavators capable of digging thousands of feet deep. And in 1945, in one hundred days—from August to November—23 were built.

    This accelerated work in the heavy machinery industry is not limited to coal mining equipment. Everyone, from Stalin to railway workers, recognizes that the faster they help the country recover, the sooner they will benefit themselves. To a Soviet person, a new record is not just a number, it means a better life. He is willing to use all his energy to make production faster. He knows that if agriculture is given more machines, there will be more bread on his table.

    The most massive of the steel rolling equipment is the steel rolling mill, which requires the output of two large blast furnaces and thirty open-hearth furnaces to supply it. Before the war, the United States took ten years to build thirteen, while now the Soviet Union is building six or seven in three years.

    The reconstruction record to date—mainly while the country was still at war—clearly shows that the Soviet Union is capable of self-reliance when necessary. (Originally published in the American New Republic magazine on January 28th this year)

　　苏联转入和平生产
    美国威廉·曼台尔
    在战争期间，苏联的医生曾不得不发展一种第六感觉——温度的感觉，因为除了军医院以外，就完全没有体温表。现在医生们又可以不再凭本能，而凭科学了。一九四五年最后三个月内，苏联的飞机工厂装造了二百万个体温表，他们还制造了同样数量的匙子，四百万个碟子，三万架切肉机，三万辆孩子用的雪车，二万五千辆自行车，四万座金属床，四万把门锁，二万五千个茶壶及咖啡壶，以及二百个烹调用的火炉——供给尚未有煤气的城市里的主妇用。
    如果说苏联的飞机工业比美国的小一些，——虽然并不如一般所认为的小得那么多——那末他们的坦克工业就比美国的大得多，美国在一九四四年出产了一万七千辆坦克，苏联还未曾透露过他们生产的数字，但是仅在战争初期搬到乌拉尔的某一工厂，在战争的四年间，就制造了一万八千辆六十吨重的坦克。这种坦克，美国直到战争快要结束时才有出产。另一工厂则制造了三万五千辆中型坦克，现在它已制造铁路车轴用的轮子与车轴。飞机工业虽还要继续制造军用及民用的飞机，坦克工业则已完全转变，甚至连名称都改了。现在它叫作运输设备人民委员部。一个大工厂只出产客车，其他的则将在今年内出产二十五万辆货车……。
    经过五年计划后，苏联在高尔基（伏尔加河上）的工厂达到九万工人的时候，这个工厂那时将每年出产三十万辆车子，主要是卡车，较苏联一切工厂一九三七年经产量多百分之一十。
    没有一种工业是转变得很容易的，但纺织工厂只须从军用调整一下，到适合民用的要求就可以了。但是在南部乌克兰，苏联面对着另一个大问题——重建问题。被德军占领的区域，包括八千八百万人口，有着其动力工厂的一半，德国人除了运走约一万四千座熔炉，一千四百个涡轮，和一万一千三百个发电机，还把剩下的之一炬，最后他们还有效地炸毁了德聂泊水闸，以至在一九四六年以前，它将不能产生电力，而且要再过三年，才能达到充分的生产。
    德聂伯水闸的大部设备已在美国做，但该动力厂生产量，仅达被毁的十分之一，其余的怎么样呢？在战争的年头内，苏联设置了等于那整个五年计划期间的新发电能量。
    这能量大部份来自一个工厂，这个工厂名叫“电力”，其恢复，代表了今天苏联的特色，它是列宁格勒的一个制造发电机的工厂，从一九四一年八月到一九四四年一月三十个月的时间，它的那座从前线就看得清楚的巨大建筑，嘲笑着在该城周围战壕里的德国包围者。他们知道了它是用作军事生产的，就反复的轰炸和每天的轰击它。官方的公报指出，这个工厂曾受到了成百的炸弹及“成千的”炮弹的轰击，从它受最后一排炮以来，还只够二个年头，但是在一九四五年，就生产了其能量等于全部德聂伯水闸——欧洲最大的——发电装备。
    列宁格勒的其他工厂，也创造了同样的奇迹，显微镜是最精确的仪器之一，它的透镜及焦点、测微计不能有一线之差，它的制造要求最高的技术水准及精确度位。在一九四五年——解脱保卫后一年，列宁格勒制造了一万二千座足够重新恢复几十个被破坏的大学的设备，并且还有一千五百架电影放映机，以带给被蹂躏地区人民的生活以一点点娱乐。列宁格勒也有制造雷达的设备，这甚至苏联还是第一次。
    植字铸造机的制造又是一种最复杂的最精细工业，包括零件六千五百，制造它需要二十种特别的工具。列宁格勒的某一工厂，一九四六年计划制造二百三十座植字铸造机，足够世界上最大的报纸设备所需的若干倍。
    列宁城饿困及炮轰达二年有半，还未实际被占领过，乌克兰则被占领过，乌克兰有一小块区域，那是苏联的鲁尔区，是一个煤矿、炼钢厂及制造厂的坚固的堡垒，这就是顿巴斯。它的一大半在斯大林诺州的范围之内，斯大林诺以苏联人口的六十分之一，生产苏联百分之四十的焦煤，百分之四十的盐，百分之卅的煤及铣铁，以及百分之廿三的钢。德国的爆炸队是特别注意不留一点可资利用的东西，在这个区域的首当其冲。苏联的工业专家在一九四三年九月随着前进中的军队，跑进这个地区作了一次调查时，他们都吓住了，该地生产力的百分之九十九点五已被毁或失去了作用。
    一九四五年七月——该地解放后二十二个月——苏联在斯大林诺作了另一次的调查。机器在整天被发动着，工人们在继续的弹穴之间推着手车，而全部的生产已达战前的百分之五十七，重工业因需要巨大的设备，还没有达到这样，但也在恢复中，铣铁及钢的生产略多于正常时期的四分之一。工厂的工程师们完成了一种空前的业迹，他们起起来整个的鼓风炉，并且把它放回到它们的基础上。煤矿的工作甚至还要好些，每天的挖掘量，已有战前的五分之二，因为苏联人知道怎样不必用抽水机而把矿井汲干。
    顿巴斯煤矿出产的一九四五年下半年的全部数字还没有，但是我们是认识的，从一九三三年到一九三七年这五年间，苏联的重机器工厂制造了六十四座开矿起重机，巨型的任重吨升降机，有挖坑机的装备，能深入地底数千英尺。而在一九四五年的一百天中间——自八月到十一月——就建立了二十三座。
    这种重机器工业中的加速工作，不只限于煤矿设备。每一个人，从斯大林到铁路工人，都确认他们帮助国家恢复得愈快，他们自己得益愈早。对于一个苏联人说来，新记录不只是一个数字，它更意味着更好的生活。他愿以其全副精力来使生产更快，他知道如果给农业以更多的机器，他的案上将有更多的面包。
    碾钢设备中最巨大的是钢碾机，该机一座要二座大鼓风炉和三十座开心炉的出产才够供应。在战前，美国以十年的时间，制造了十三座，而现在苏联在三年内，就制造六七座。
    迄今的重建记录——主要的是当该国还在战争的时候——清楚的指出，必要的时候，苏联是能自力更生的。（原文载今年一月二十八日美国新共和杂志）
