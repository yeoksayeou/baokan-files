[From the Tongpu Front, 24th dispatch] Dong Zhao, Commander-in-Chief of Chiang’s 38th Army Group, arrived in Wenxi on the 16th to directly command the Chiang troops continuing their northward advance along the Tongpu Railway line in Houma and other areas. Three regiments of Chiang's troops are currently assembled inside Quwo city on the east side of Houma. On the 21st, in coordination with more than 1,300 men from the Yan Army Security Regiment in the county, they invaded Sucun and other areas of Yicheng, immediately encountering a strong counterattack from our troops, and they fled back to the city in a panic. They launched another attack on the 22nd, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the aforementioned areas.

[Our newspaper, Handan, 21st dispatch] Hu Zongnan's troops in southern Shanxi, with a force of three armies, totaling five divisions and ten regiments, under the cover of airplanes and tanks, moved north along the Tongpu Road in Wenxi in four columns on the 18th, and have occupied Houma and other places, attacking the Tongpu line and the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area under the control of the Eighth Route Army. Hu Zongnan flew to Yuncheng on the 17th under the order of Chiang Kai-shek to personally command the operation. A Xinhua News Agency reporter pointed out: After Chiang Kai-shek's attack on southern Shanxi failed last month, he redeployed his forces and launched a second attack on us, echoing the Chiang troops' attacks on the Suwan-Jinpuhuai area, attempting to further organize the Chiang-Yan allied forces to seize the Tongpu Railway under the control of the Eighth Route Army, and move north along Houma-Linfen, coordinating with the troops of the 11th War Zone of the Kuomintang advancing westward along the Zhengtai Railway to encircle and attack our liberated areas, and finally converge in Taiyuan, cutting off our liberated areas in Shanxi, as a springboard for Chiang's troops to attack the North China liberated areas, and becoming a fortress for Chiang Kai-shek to directly command the civil war in Shanxi. The reporter continued: This conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek's internal war clique is not going smoothly. During the last attack on southern Shanxi, the Chiang-Yan allied forces dispatched a total of seven divisions, but under the heroic self-defense and counterattack of the army and people in the liberated areas, five regiments of Chiang's direct line troops were completely annihilated by us, resulting in the Chiang army's occupation of the area for less than a month before most of it was recovered by us. The southern section of Tongpu is still in our hands, and Chiang's attempt to open the Tongpu Road was completely shattered by us. In the self-defense counterattack battles in Tongpu and Zhengtai in the first and middle of this month, Hongdong and Zhaocheng, important towns in Tongpu, were recovered by us again, and more than a hundred miles of railway line between Hongdong and Zhaocheng was controlled by us. The Zhengtai Road was also cut into several sections by the local Eighth Route Army, and the Chiang-Yan allied forces were cut off from north to south, without contact with each other. Therefore, the reporter finally pointed out: This new offensive by the Chiang-Yan allied forces will inevitably encounter serious difficulties and meet with a more powerful blow from the army and people in the liberated areas!

　　晋南蒋阎军进犯
    激战在翼城苏村等地进行中
    【同蒲前线二十四日电】蒋军三十八集团军总司令董钊，已于十六日由运城抵达闻喜，直接指挥沿同蒲线侯马等地继续北犯之蒋军。侯马东侧曲沃城内现集结蒋军三个团，二十一日配合该县阎军保安团共一千三百余人侵我翼城苏村等地，当即遭我军有力反击，狼狈窜回城内。二十二日再度出犯，现激战正在上述地区进行中。
    【本报邯郸二十一日电】晋南胡宗南军，十八日以三个军共五个师十个团的兵力，在飞机坦克掩护下，沿闻喜同蒲路四路北上，已占我侯马等地，进攻八路军控制下的同蒲沿线及晋南解放区。胡宗南奉蒋介石命令于十七日飞赴运城亲自指挥。新华社记者指出：蒋介石上月进攻晋南失败后，重新部署兵力，向我进行的第二次进攻已经开始了，将与苏皖津浦陇海蒋军进攻遥相呼应，企图进一步组织蒋阎联军夺取八路军控制下的同蒲线，并沿侯马临汾北上，与沿正太路西进之国民党十一战区部队夹击我解放区，最后会师太原，割裂我山西各解放区，作为蒋军进攻华北解放区的一道跳板，成为蒋介石直接指挥山西内战的堡垒。该记者继称：蒋介石内战集团此一阴谋并不是得心应手的。上次进攻晋南时，蒋阎联军共出动了七个师的兵力，但在解放区军民的英勇自卫反击下，蒋军嫡系部队五个团，即全部被我歼灭，致蒋军侵占地区不及一月，即大部为我收复。同蒲南段仍在我军手中，蒋军打通同蒲路企图乃彻底被我粉碎。本月上中旬在同蒲正太自卫反击战中，同蒲重镇之洪洞、赵城又为我收复，洪赵间百余里铁道线为我控制，正太路亦为当地八路军切为数段，蒋阎联军已南北隔断互不联系。因此该记者最后指出：此次蒋阎联军的新进攻必将遭受严重的困难，遇到解放区军民更有力的打击！
