　　Strange Drama in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East
　　Liberation Daily Editorial, 30th
　　Yesterday's newspaper reported on the trial of Doihara in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Doihara was an expert in the Japanese invasion of China, serving as the head of Japanese intelligence agencies in the Northeast and North China. He was one of the main instigators of the September 18th Incident, the North China Incident, and the Lugouqiao Incident. When mentioning this heinous war criminal, the Chinese people gnash their teeth in hatred. Logically, our representative in the tribunal for judging Japanese warlords should righteously accuse the Japanese of their atrocities, enumerate the war crimes, seek justice for our millions of victims, and urge the court to impose severe sentences as a clear warning. However, the representative of the Kuomintang government, Vice Minister of National Defense Qin Dechun, who testified in court, not only failed to present a powerful accusation but was intimidated by Doihara's arrogance, turning the war criminal trial into a strange drama of a witness being cowed by the accused. China is a victorious nation, Japan is a defeated nation, yet the representative of the victorious nation showed timidity and incompetence before a war criminal of the defeated nation who was already bound and awaiting sentencing. This is truly a shameful phenomenon unprecedented in history!
　　However, the strange drama in the Tokyo Tribunal is not accidental. The appearance of this strange drama reflects, on the one hand, the attitude of the American authorities today, which is not to severely punish Japanese fascist war criminals but to adopt an attitude of appeasement and indulgence; on the other hand, it also illustrates how corrupt and incompetent the Kuomintang government is. Among the bureaucratic warlords of the Kuomintang government, Qin Dechun is not the most typical figure. Qin Dechun's disgrace in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East is a minor case compared to the power-grabbing, humiliating, corrupt, incompetent, and people-harming behavior of the main leaders of the Kuomintang government. It is well known that before the "July 7th" Incident, the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented a policy of non-resistance, abandoning the Northeast, signing the Shanghai, Tanggu, and He-Ume agreements, and conspiring with figures like Doihara to suppress the Chinese people's anti-Japanese national salvation movement. During the War of Resistance, the reactionaries were passive in resisting Japan on the one hand, and maintained constant contact with Japanese emissaries on the other, and implemented the so-called "curved-line national salvation theory," dispatching a large number of generals to surrender to the Japanese, colluding with the enemy to carry out the conspiracy to eliminate the Liberated Areas. After the victory of the War of Resistance, in his speech on August 15th, Chiang Kai-shek declared: "We must be able to love the enemy" and "not dwell on old grievances." Under this absurd policy, Chiang Kai-shek used Japanese troops, incorporated puppet troops, and alongside the American-equipped Kuomintang army, attacked the Liberated Areas, slaughtering their own compatriots. Even today, the top war criminal Okamura Neiji still resides in Nanjing, unpunished. Based solely on these facts, it is not difficult to understand why Japanese warlords do not take the representatives of the Kuomintang government seriously at all. In the past, the Chiang Kai-shek government had bowed down to the Japanese warlords countless times, and the Japanese warlords had manipulated the Chiang Kai-shek government at will. Today, the Chinese fascist reactionaries still maintain contact with the remnants of Japanese fascism, colluding with each other. Precisely because of this, when several ordinary Chinese citizens testified about the atrocities of the Japanese army in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, war criminals such as Tojo and Doihara "looked down and remained silent," but when the official representative of the Chinese government, the Kuomintang government, came out to testify, the war criminals became animated, and the chief war criminal Tojo even "laughed heartily."
　　The strange drama in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East symbolizes the Kuomintang government's loss of sovereignty and humiliation, and its corruption. On the international stage, it not only cannot represent the will of the Chinese people, but is constantly losing the dignity of our country. If this situation continues, the glorious status of being one of the four great powers, which the Chinese people won through blood and sacrifice, is in danger of being completely lost.
　　The Chinese people suffered the most from the Japanese invasion and sacrificed the most in the anti-Japanese war. The democratization of Japan after the war is closely related to China's independence, peace, and democratic cause. Therefore, the Chinese people are extremely concerned about the Allied powers' control of Japan. The Chinese people cannot allow the American authorities to continue their policy of condoning war criminals, and especially cannot allow the Kuomintang government authorities to be indifferent to this policy, so that Japanese fascist war criminals still dare to show contempt for the Chinese nation today. As one of the major countries that defeated Japan, China has the right and the obligation to actively participate in the work of controlling Japan. The current Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government has repeatedly proven its incompetence in fulfilling this historical task. In order to guarantee China's prestige in the international community, the Chinese people can no longer allow the Chiang Kai-shek government to send representatives to international conferences alone. In order to enable the true representatives of the Chinese people to actively participate in the work of controlling Japan, and to ensure the thorough elimination of Japanese war criminals and militarism and the democratization of the Japanese state, so as to guarantee lasting peace in the Far East, we believe that the Allied Council for Japan, the Far Eastern Commission, and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East should not only have representatives of the Kuomintang government participating, but should also allow the Chinese people, especially the representatives of the Liberated Areas who fought most heroically and contributed the most to the anti-Japanese war, to participate.

### 远东国际法庭上的怪剧  解放日报三十日社论

　　远东国际法庭上的怪剧
    解放日报三十日社论
    昨天报上登载远东国际法庭审判土肥原的消息，土肥原是日寇侵华阴谋专家，历任日寇在东北和华北的特务机关长，为九一八事变、华北事变、芦沟桥事变的主要策动者之一，一提起这一罪恶滔天的战犯，我们中国人民莫不切齿痕恨。照理，我国代表在审判日本军阀的法庭上，自应理直气壮控告日寇暴行，列数战犯罪恶，为我千百万被难同胞伸冤，督促法庭严加判决，明证典刑。可是出庭作证的国民党政府代表国防部次长秦德纯，既不能提出有力的控诉，反而慑于土肥原狂妄的气焰，演成战犯审判证人的怪剧。中国是战胜国，日本是战败国，战胜国的代表竟然在已经束手就缚等待判罪的战败国战犯的前面表现畏缩无能，这真是古今中外未有的可耻现象！
    但是，东京法庭上的怪剧，并不是偶然的。这一怪剧的出现，一方面反映美国当局今天对日本法西斯战犯不是给以严厉的惩罚，而是采取姑息和纵容的态度；另一方面，又说明国民党政府当局是如何腐朽无能。在国民党政府的官僚军阀中间，秦德纯并不是最典型的人物，秦德纯在远东国际法庭出丑，较诸国民党政府的主要负责人丧权辱国，腐朽无能，残害人民的行为，可以说是小巫见大巫。尽人皆知，“七七”以前，国民党反动派实行不抵抗主义，抛送东北，签订上海、塘沽、何梅等协定，并与土肥原之流，同谋镇压中国人民的抗日救国运动。在抗战中，反动派一方面消极抗战，另方面与日寇密使不断往来，并实行所谓“曲线救国论”，派遣大批将领投降日寇，勾结敌人进行消灭解放区的阴谋。在抗战胜利以后，蒋介石八月十五日演讲中，即宣称：“要能爱敌”，要“不念旧恶”。在这种荒谬方针之下，蒋介石就使用日军，收编伪军，与美械化的国民党军队并肩进攻解放区，屠杀本国同胞。直到今天，头号战犯冈村宁次还是安居南京，没有受到审判。仅仅根据以上这些事实，就不难了解为什么日本军阀对国民党政府的代表根本不放在眼内。在过去，蒋介石政府曾对日本军阀作无数次的屈膝，日本军阀曾把蒋介石政府玩弄于掌股之上。在今天，中国法西斯反动派也还和日本法西斯残余保持联系，狼狈为奸。正因为如此，当几个中国普通公民在远东国际法庭上证明日军暴行时，东条、土肥原等战争罪犯，都“眼睛望下，沉默不语”，而当中国政府国民党政府的正式代表出来作证时，战犯们反而眉飞色舞，战犯首条甚至“哈哈大笑”。
    远东国际法庭上的怪剧，象征着蒋介石政府的丧权辱国和腐朽，它在国际舞台上，不但不能代表中国人民的意志，反而在天天丧失我们国家的尊严，这种情况如果继续下去，中国人民流血牺牲所争来的四强之一的光荣地位，有被完全丧失的危险。
    中国人民受日寇侵略的祸害最为深重，在反日战争中牺牲最大，而战后日本的民主化，对于中国的独立、和平与民主事业有密切的关系，因此中国人民对盟国管制日本的工作，是异常关切的，中国人民不能允许美国当局继续纵容战犯的政策，尤其不能允许国民党政府当局对这种政策的漠不关心，以致使得日本法西斯战犯到今天还敢于对中华民族表示轻侮。中国作为战胜日本的主要国家之一，有权利也有义务积极参加管制日本的工作，今天的蒋介石独裁政府对于这一历史任务，已再三证明其不能胜任。为了保证中国在国际上的威信，中国人民再不能允许蒋介石政府独自派遣代表出席国际会议，为了使中国人民的真正代表积极参加管制日本的工作，并保证日本战犯与军国主义的彻底肃清与日本国家的民主化，以保证远东的持久和平，我们认为盟国对日本委员会、远东委员会和远东国际法庭，决不应仅仅有国民党政府的代表参加，而应当允许中国人民，特别是对日抗战最英勇、贡献特大的解放区人民代表参加。
