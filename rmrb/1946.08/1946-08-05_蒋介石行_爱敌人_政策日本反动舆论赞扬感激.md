Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek's "love the enemy" "lenient policy" has been praised by Japanese reactionary public opinion. The Yomiuri Shimbun, now a mouthpiece for Japanese reactionaries, published an editorial on the 31st of last month, following Yoshida's statement, stating that while the Japanese army performed an unprecedented massacre in Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek was still able to demand that the Chinese people treat the Japanese in China with leniency, which is the "most benevolent and civilized" act in modern history. The editorial specifically expressed gratitude to Chiang.

　　蒋介石行“爱敌人”政策日本反动舆论赞扬感激
    【新华社延安二日电】东京讯：蒋介石“爱敌人”的“宽大政策”，获得日本反动舆论的赞扬，现为日本反动派喉舌的读卖新闻，于上月三十一日继吉田声明后发表社评，认为日军在南京表演了史无前例的大屠杀，而蒋介石尚能要求中国人民宽待在华日人，乃为现代史上“最仁爱及最文明”之举。该社评特对蒋表示谢意。
