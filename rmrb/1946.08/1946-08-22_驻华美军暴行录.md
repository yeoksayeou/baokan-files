Record of Atrocities by U.S. Troops Stationed in China
　　Jian Sheng
　　Due to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and obsequious behavior towards foreign powers, U.S. troops stationed in Kuomintang-controlled areas such as Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, and Chongqing have acted with impunity, wantonly killing people, plundering property, raping women, and engaging in armed smuggling. The incidents of people being killed by jeeps and U.S. warships are too numerous to count. Taking Shanghai as an example, according to incomplete statistics, from September of last year to July of this year, over eleven months, such atrocities occurred almost daily. The number of people killed or injured by these atrocities reached 1,500, not including those who suffered losses from fraud, robbery, insult, and rape.

　　According to an official Kuomintang material, it tells us that in the 126 days from September 12th of last year to January 10th of this year, as many as 495 jeep-related killings occurred in Shanghai alone, averaging four such tragedies every day. 236 of our compatriots were run over (including serious injuries and those who would become disabled), with 18 deaths, averaging two deaths or injuries per day (the actual number of casualties was even higher). (See Frontline Daily, January 12th). According to incomplete statistics of jeep-related tragedies published in six newspapers, in 78 jeep-related tragedies from December 8th of last year to July 28th of this year, 115 people were injured, with 34 deaths from serious injuries. Combining the above two statistics, U.S. military jeeps in Shanghai injured 380 of our compatriots. If we calculate based on the official statistic of an average of two deaths or injuries per day, approximately 600 people were injured or killed by jeeps over the eleven months.

　　The largest of these tragedies was the "Avenue Albert Bloodbath." According to the Associated Press, at 8 p.m. on December 8th of last year, a U.S. military 2.5-ton truck sped wildly along "Avenue Albert," immediately crashing into a private car, killing one person and seriously injuring three (two of whom died after being sent to the hospital). The truck then crashed into a pedicab, killing the driver and seriously injuring the passenger. The vehicle still did not stop, speeding towards the intersection of Avenue Joffre, injuring two pedestrians, destroying several rickshaws, running over a dog, and knocking down several trees and a utility pole. The vehicle caused four incidents in total, running over and killing four people, seriously injuring three, and slightly injuring one. In another incident on April 7th, a 15-year-old girl, Zi Jufang, was knocked down by a speeding jeep, her brains splattered and her chest bleeding profusely. On the same day, a 59-year-old woman was hit from behind by a jeep, her head split open in a horrific scene (Zhengyan Daily). On June 29th, a middle-aged woman was traveling to Chengdu Road on a Route 1 tram when her arm extended out of the window and was crushed by a speeding jeep, causing severe bleeding (Zhonghua Times). The well-known Chinese playwright Xia Yan and poet Ge Baoquan were also injured by jeeps driven by U.S. troops, with Xia injuring his right hand and right leg, and Ge suffering more serious injuries (Xinbao, March 16th). Since January of this year, the tragedies have not decreased. According to a short commentary in Shanghai Xinbao, jeep-related tragedies have become "commonplace," so reporters include them in the brief news column, or even omit them altogether. However, browsing through various newspapers, many tragedies are still reported.

　　U.S. warships docked in the Huangpu River, like jeeps on land, frequently damaged ships and injured dockworkers. According to a statistic from the United Evening News on June 28th, an average of two dockworkers were injured every day, meaning that over the eleven months, over 600 dockworkers became victims of U.S. warships. The safety of sailors was also extremely precarious. For example, on February 16th, a barge was sunk by a U.S. landing craft, killing one person and injuring two.

　　Incidents of U.S. sailors in Shanghai beating or shooting our compatriots for no reason occurred almost daily. According to statistics from a relevant authority regarding U.S. military-related injuries, damages, and losses in Shanghai, quoted in the Frontline Daily on January 21st, there were six incidents in October of last year, fourteen in November, and thirty-one in December. This means that there was an average of one incident every five days in October, which increased to one incident every two days in November, and further increased to one incident every day in December. According to incomplete statistics from six newspapers, in the thirty cases of U.S. military harm to Chinese people that occurred between December of last year and July 30th of this year, 44 people were injured, including 15 with serious injuries. If we calculate based on the average of one injury case per day in December according to official statistics, U.S. troops in Shanghai have harmed at least 300 Chinese people without reason over the past ten months. The brutality of U.S. troops is fully demonstrated in the above-mentioned injury cases. For example, on July 8th, a U.S. soldier fired a gun from a pedicab at a passerby on Chengdu Road. On the afternoon of July 30th, a U.S. soldier hired a rickshaw, and when the driver hesitated slightly because he did not understand English, the U.S. soldier cut off five of the driver's fingers with a knife. On March 30th, two U.S. sailors took a rickshaw, refused to pay, and when the driver asked for payment, the two sailors gathered a group of sailors and beat the driver, Lu Guiyin, until his head was bleeding and his bones were broken. On January 22nd, when 20,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai marched to petition outside the Bund on Beijing Road, a group of U.S. soldiers threw beer bottles at the workers from the upper floors of a building, injuring five workers, including two seriously injured. On January 12th, three U.S. sailors injured four students from Changzhou Middle School with stones at the entrance of Xieqiao Alley.

　　In addition, robbery and rape also occurred frequently among U.S. troops. According to official statistics, the incidents of U.S. troops stationed in Shanghai robbing or defrauding Chinese people occurred 31 times in the 100 days from October of last year to January 10th of this year, almost once every three days. On January 12th, more than ten U.S. soldiers robbed pedestrians of their coats and watches near the Dashing Company on Nanjing Road, the busiest street in Shanghai. On March 10th, Wang Jiahua, the Chinese editor of Reuters, was robbed of several thousand yuan and beaten by four or five U.S. soldiers near Hankou Road. On December 22nd of last year, four U.S. soldiers openly robbed street vendors of cigarettes from a jeep on the Bund of Nanjing Road. On March 22nd, three U.S. sailors drank at the Sameli Bar on Nanjing Road, refused to pay, and beat the waiter.

　　Incidents of U.S. troops insulting decent women also occurred frequently. According to the Shanghai Daily on April 10th, two female students from a certain school walked past Xieqiao Alley, where the U.S. military club was located, and two U.S. sailors jumped off a rickshaw and "grabbed a petite female student like an eagle catching a chick, jumped back into the car, and the two sailors hugged her wildly." On June 28th, four U.S. soldiers in Chongqing openly broke into the women's bathroom of the Dasha Hotel, insulted the women who were bathing, and then gathered more than twenty U.S. soldiers to destroy the hotel. According to Zhengyan Daily, on the night of March 15th, a woman surnamed Deng on Xinchang Road was followed home by four U.S. soldiers and forcibly raped. In short, the various atrocities of U.S. troops listed above occurred frequently wherever U.S. troops were stationed, such as Qingdao, Beiping, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Even Admiral Cooke, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in China, had to admit at a press conference in Shanghai in late March that U.S. troops stationed in China "did have overstepping actions" (U.S. News Service telegram, March 22nd).

　　Chiang Kai-shek's government never made any protests against these atrocities by U.S. troops. On the contrary, the Kuomintang's official newspaper, Peace Daily, published a speech by U.S. Navy Patrol Commander House on March 30th, claiming that U.S. military "illegal acts were not many." The Kuomintang authorities "supplied all the most beautiful buildings in Shanghai to the U.S. military for their use" (Shanghai Times, April 19th). Regarding the atrocities of U.S. troops, such as drunkenness and raping women, they even said that they were "using fine wine and women to cure the 'homesickness' of their allies" (Xinbao, March 17th).

　　驻华美军暴行录
　　简生
    由于蒋介石的卖国媚外，美军在上海、青岛、天津、北平、汉口、重庆等国民党统治区横行无忌，肆意枪杀人民，劫掠财物，奸淫妇女，武装走私，吉普车和美舰杀人事件尤不可胜数。以上海为例，根据不完全的统计，自去年九月到今年七月的十一个月中，这种暴行日必数起，在暴行下死伤的人民达一千五百人，被欺诈、抢劫和侮辱奸淫而遭受损失者，尚不在内。
    仅据国民党官方发表的一个材料，它告诉我们：在去年九月十二日起至本年一月十日止的一百二十六天中，上海一地就发生了吉普杀人事件四百九十五人之多，平均每天就有四件惨案。辗伤（包括重伤和将成残废）我同胞二百三十六人，内辗死十八人，平均每天死伤二人（实际伤亡还不只此数）。（见一月十二日前线日报）另据六个报纸所载吉普惨案的不完全统计，自去年十二月八日起至本年七月二十八日止的七十八件吉普惨案中，即有一百十五人受伤，内三十四人伤重死亡。以上两个统计，合计美军吉普车在沪辗伤我同胞即达三百八十人。如以官方统计平均每日死伤两人计，十一个月约有六百余人为吉普所伤亡。
    惨案中最大一次为“亚尔培路血案”，据合众社称：去年十二月八日夜八时，有美军用二吨半巨型卡车一辆，沿“亚尔培路”狂驰，当即撞毁私人汽车一辆，死一人，重伤三人（内二人送医院后殒命）。该车又撞毁三轮车一辆，撞死车夫一人，乘客重伤。讵该车仍不停止，驰向巨籁达路口，又伤两路人，毁人力车数辆，并辗死一犬，且撞倒树木数枝，电线钢杆一根。该车共肇祸四起，前后辗死四人，重伤三人，轻伤一人。他如四月七日，十五岁少女紫菊芳被疾驰之吉普一辆辗倒，脑浆迸裂，胸膛血流如注。同日，一五十九岁老妇被吉普从背后撞倒，头部裂开，惨不忍睹（正言报）。六月二十九日，一中年女子乘一路电车往成都路时，手臂伸出窗外，为一疾驰之吉普轧断，鲜血淋漓（中华时报）。我国著名剧作家夏衍及诗人戈宝权，也被美军因吉普车撞伤，夏右手及右腿受伤，戈受伤甚重（三月十六日辛报）。从本年一月以来，惨案并未减少，据上海辛报短评中称：因吉普惨案已成“司空见惯”之事，故报人将其编入简讯栏，甚至不用，但翻阅各报，仍见有不少惨案登出。
    停泊在黄浦江口中的美舰，也像陆上的吉普车一样，时常撞坏船只与小工。据六月二十八日联合晚报统计，每天总有两个小工挂彩，即是说，十一个月来，已有小工六百余人成了美舰的牺牲品。水手的生命安全亦极可虑，如二月十六日驳船一只为美登陆艇撞沉，死一人，伤二人。
    美海军在沪无端殴打或枪杀我同胞的事件，几乎每天发生。据一月二十一日前线日报征引某主管机关关于美军在沪发生之伤害、毁坏、损害之统计中称：去年十月份共犯案六起，十一月份十四起，十二月份三十一起；亦即十月份中平均五天一起，十一月份就增为二天一起，到十二月份更激增至一天犯案一起。另据六个报纸的不完全统计：自去年十二月至今年七月三十日间发生的三十起美军伤害华人案中，受伤的人数达四十四人，内重伤十五人，若以官方统计中十二月份的伤害案为平均数、即每天犯伤害案一起死伤一人计算，十个月来美军在沪至少已无故伤害中国人民三百人。以上在这些伤害案中，充分表现美军的凶残。例如七月八日，美兵一名乘三轮车经成都路，见有路人就在车中开枪射击。七月三十日下午，美兵一人雇洋车，车夫因不懂美国话，拉车稍加迟疑，美兵即用刀砍掉车夫五指。三月三十日，美水兵两名乘三轮车，不给车资，车夫向其索取，该两兵即集合水兵一群，将车夫吕贵银打得头破血流，筋骨折断方去。又如一月二十二日，上海两万失业工人游行请愿经过北京路外滩，一群美兵竟在某大厦高层用啤酒瓶猛掷工人，击伤工人五名，内二人重伤。一日十二日，有美水兵三人在斜桥弄口，用石块殴伤常州中学学生四人。
    此外，抢劫财物与强奸妇女，在美军中亦不断发生。据官方统计，驻沪美军抢劫或欺诈华人的事件，在去年十月至今年一月十日的一百天中，共发生三十一起，几乎平均每三日一起。一月十二日，竟有美军十余人在上海最热闹的南京路大新公司附近，结伙抢去行人的大衣手表等物。三月十日，路透社中文编辑王家骅，在汉口路附近被美兵四五人劫去数千元，复遭殴伤。去年十二月二十二日，南京路外滩一带，美军四人乘吉普车公然抢劫小贩所售香烟。三月二十二日，美海军三人在南京路沙梅利酒吧间饮酒后，不付酒资，并殴伤侍者。
    美军侮辱良家妇女事件，亦不断发生。据四月十日上海日报载，某校两个女学生走过美国军人俱乐部所在地的斜桥弄，二个美国水兵从三轮车上跳下，“老鹰抓小鸡般地抓住一个娇小的女学生跳回车上，两个水兵狂搂着她”。六月二十八日，重庆美兵四名竟公然闯入大厦旅社女浴室，对正在沐浴的妇女百般侮辱，复纠集美兵二十余人将该旅社大肆捣毁。又据正言报载：三月十五日夜，新昌路邓姓之女，由外归家，竟被四美兵跟踪闯入，强行奸淫。总之，上面列举美军的种种暴行，举凡美军足迹所至，如青岛、北平、汉口、广州等地，均层出不穷，甚至连美驻华海军最高统帅柯克上将三月下旬在沪记者招待会上，也不得不承认驻华美军“确有越轨行动”了（三月二十二日美新闻处电）。
    对于美军这些暴行，蒋介石政府从未提出任何抗议；相反的，国民党机关报——和平日报并于三月三十日刊载美海军巡逻司令侯斯的谈话，认为美军“不法行为，实不为多”。国民党当局将“全上海最漂亮的建筑物，全部供给美军应用”（四月十九日上海时事新报）。对于美军酗酒奸淫妇女等暴行，还说是“以醇酒妇人疗治盟友的‘思乡病’”。（三月十七日辛报）
