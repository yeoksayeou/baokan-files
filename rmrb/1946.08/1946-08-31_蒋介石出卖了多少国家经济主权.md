　　How Much National Economic Sovereignty Did Chiang Kai-shek Sell Out?
    Liao Gailong

    From 1938 until the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the United States extended nine loans to China, totaling $1,247,800,000. Adding the cotton loan after the war ($33,000,000), the total was $1,280,800,000. The long-negotiated but not yet officially established new loan of $500,000,000 is not included.

    Under the Lend-Lease Act, the United States lent Chiang Kai-shek's government armaments and other war materials worth over $1,500,000,000 to date (see the Associated Press dispatch from Washington on July 21), of which more than two-thirds were supplied after the end of the Anti-Japanese War. In fact, this is an investment by the US authorities in Chiang Kai-shek's civil war gamble.

    Adding the above two items to the pre-war US investment in China of $340,000,000 (these assets have mostly returned to their original state after Japan's surrender), the total amounts to over $3,000,000,000, excluding other economic investments after the war.

    As a result, the balance of power of various imperialist countries controlling China has been completely changed: According to reliable statistics, before the war in 1934, Japanese imperialist investment in China totaled $2,540,000,000, accounting for 53% of the total investment by the powers; British investment was $1,160,000,000, accounting for 24%; while the United States had only $340,000,000 in investment, accounting for only 7%. Now Japan's investment has been confiscated, and British investment in China is less than one-third of US capital in comparison, and cannot even maintain its original position. US capital monopolizes China under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and the joint domination of several major powers before the war has now become the monopoly of the United States alone.

    Through the above huge loans, the US monopoly capital group has placed the financial power of Chiang Kai-shek's government under its control. For example, since 1944, they have replaced Britain in controlling the entire Chinese customs; since the Pacific War, British control over Chinese currency has also been completely eliminated by the United States. Before the war, in 1934-35, the equilibrium between the pound and the dollar, which was determined by the Anglo-American struggle for Chinese currency power, has, since the Pacific War, completely divorced the Chinese currency exchange rate from the pound and entered the dollar group. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the United States and Chinese reactionaries colluded, using their control over China's foreign exchange to stipulate a low exchange rate that facilitated the dumping of American goods (Chinese prices have risen more than 7,000 times, that is, the legal currency has depreciated to less than one-seven-thousandth, but the US exchange rate is set at 690 times the pre-war level, so the price of American goods within China is extremely low), forcing the Chinese people to bear a loss of more than 60 million US dollars per month in the national treasury, and the Kuomintang comprador bureaucrat capital group makes several times more profit than this by trafficking in American goods. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, US banks in China, with the help of US loans to Chiang Kai-shek, also obtained the right to operate in US dollars, completely restoring the pre-war situation in which Chinese currency circulation was divided by imperialism.

    US monopoly capital is actively investing in and monopolizing various sectors of China's national economy. As early as the end of 1944, the United States sent a large number of technical advisors to carry out activities under the guise of assisting Chiang Kai-shek's government in establishing a "Wartime Production Board." Last February, the US Foreign Economic Administration also published a "Guide to China's Industrialization," which formulated a broad investment plan for China's mining, industry, and transportation, stipulating that in five years, it would "assist" in establishing 953 industrial and mining units, investing $972,430,000, and investing $897,630,000 in railway, highway, and river transportation, totaling $1,870,060,000. The implementation of this plan will allow all sectors of China's national economy to be completely and directly controlled by US monopoly capital. At the same time, British capital, which originally held a major advantage, will be excluded. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to the existing US enterprises in China - such as the China National Aviation Corporation, which is directed behind the scenes by Pan American Airlines, the Shanghai Electric and Gas Company and the telephone company of the Rockefeller system, etc. - having been restored to their original state, the aforementioned US investment plans and various investment activities are being actively carried out. The US trust Global Production Company has obtained the right to explore and extract oil beds in Northwest China, and there are already twenty-five oil wells working in the Gobi Desert, producing 4,000 barrels of oil per day. A group of American oil companies is forming a special enterprise combination (TASS dispatch on July 5), and Westinghouse Electric Corporation is signing a contract with the Kuomintang government to establish a large-scale factory in China. China's largest joint state-private shipping company, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (now owning more than 400,000 tons of ships), had already established ties with American capital before the war. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the company is, in fact, controlled by American capital, and a large number of management and technical personnel are Americans. The China Water Transport Team, owned by UNRRA (more than 75% of UNRRA's assets are owned by the United States), has been established and currently has more than 20,000 tons of ships, with plans to reach more than 200,000 tons. US Air Force General Chennault recently organized an air cargo company and, in conjunction with more than 30 agents of Chinese comprador bureaucrat capital, initiated the organization of the "China Industrial Company," with capital of 100 million legal tender, which will monopolize the procurement and transportation of all important import and export commodities in China. The China Industrial Company will also establish branches in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, and other places, with its own vehicles and ships for transporting goods. Investment in railway and highway transportation is also being actively planned. In addition, US yarn mills, weaving, shipbuilding, chemical, cement, and flour factories will also appear in China.

    Through the forms of sand, tin, and tung oil loans, US capital has gradually penetrated the Chinese countryside, directly grasping and seizing China's raw materials - agricultural products. In November last year, the "International Trade Conference Recommendations" drafted by the US State Department and adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in February this year stipulated that China should be an exporter of "primary commodities" (note: i.e., raw materials, mainly agricultural products) in international market relations, while the industrial products China needs should be imported from foreign countries. At the end of June this year, the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" was formally established; When the head of the group, Shi Zhisheng, talked about the purpose of the group, he said: It will "specially focus on studying the improvement and increased production methods of China's four agricultural products for export: silk, tea, wool, and tung oil." China is becoming a raw material supply factory monopolized by US monopoly capital.

    As mentioned above, the reactionary financial capitalists and plutocrats of the United States are turning China into a country like Latin America, transforming China from a semi-colony jointly controlled by the monopolistic capital of the powers before the war into a vassal state and colony exclusively occupied by one country.

    One hundred and five years ago, China failed in the Opium War and signed the Treaty of Nanjing, which guaranteed the export of imperialist goods to China and caused China to lose its customs barriers. Fifty years ago, we failed again in the Sino-Japanese War. In the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the Qing emperor recognized the privilege of imperialism to establish factories in China, allowing the powers to smoothly carry out the export of capital to China and thus jeopardizing the development prospects of Chinese national capital. Thirty years ago, the traitor Yuan Shikai recognized Japan's Twenty-One Demands, stipulating a broad plan for Japanese investment in China, but Yuan Shikai was still wary of the fifth clause, which stipulated that China should hire Japanese as military, political, and economic advisors and that China and Japan should jointly run arsenals and police, and did not dare to recognize it. Now that China has won victory in the war against Japan, and the opportunity for China to lift the economic shackles of the imperialist powers for a century and independently and smoothly develop its national productive forces has arrived, the reactionary financial capital groups of the United States have obtained privileges exceeding the Treaty of Nanjing, the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and the Twenty-One Demands. What does this rely on? This relies on the "cooperation" of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. In order to exchange the military intervention of the reactionary financial capital of the United States as the only reliance for maintaining dictatorship and carrying out civil war, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries do not hesitate to auction off the future destiny of the entire nation, and the scale of its auction far exceeds the entire Qing Dynasty and Yuan Shikai.

　　蒋介石出卖了多少国家经济主权
    廖盖隆
    自一九三八年至抗战结束时为止，美国对华贷款九次，金额共为十二万万四千七百八十万美元，加上抗战结束后的一次棉花借款（三千三百万美元），共为十二万万八千零八十万美元，洽商已久、迄未正式成立的五万万美元新借款还未计入。
    在租借法案项下，美国借给蒋介石政府之军火及其他战争物资，迄最近为止，计值已达十五万万美元以上（见美联社七月二十一日华盛顿电），其中三分之二以上为抗战结束后所供给，实际上这乃是美国当局对蒋介石内战赌博的投资。
    上述两项再加美国战前对华投资额三万万四千万美元（这些资产在日本投降后，已纷纷恢复旧观），总数已达三十万万美金以上，而抗战后的其他经济事业投资还未计入。
    结果，各帝国主义国家控制中国的力量对比便整个改观：据可靠的统计，战前一九三四年，日本帝国主义在华投资共为二十五万万四千万美元，占列强投资额百分之五十三；英国投资十一万万六千万美元，占百分之二十四；而美国则仅有三万万四千万美元的投资，仅占百分之七。现在日本的投资被没收，英国在华投资，相形之下，已不及美国资本的三分之一，而且甚至不能保持其原有地位。美国资本独占了蒋介石统治下的中国，战前几个大列强的共同支配，现在已变为美国一国的独占。
    美国垄断资本集团，通过上述巨大的借款，已把蒋介石政府的财政金融大权置于股掌之上。举例说：他们自一九四四年后，已取代英国而控制了整个中国的海关；自太平洋战争之后，英国对中国货币上的控制权，亦为美国所完全排除。战前一九三四——三五年，英美争夺中国货币权结果所确定的英镑与美元的均势，自太平洋战争后，中国货币汇率已完全脱离英镑而投入美元集团。抗战结束后，美国和中国的反动派勾结起来，利用其对中国外汇的控制，规定了一种便于美货倾销的低外汇（中国物价已涨七千多倍，亦即法币已跌值为七千分之一以下，但美汇被规定为战前的六百九十倍，因此美货在中国以内的价格极端低廉），使中国人民每月须负担美金六千万元以上的国库损失，而国民党买办官僚资本集团借贩运美货获利尤数倍于此。在抗战结束后，美国在华银行借美国对蒋介石借款之助，又取得了经营美钞的权利，完全恢复了战前中国货币流通被帝国主义所割裂的原状。
    美国垄断资本正积极进行对中国国民经济各部门的投资与垄断活动。早在一九四四年底，美国即在协助蒋介石政府设立“战时生产局”名义下，派遣了大批的技术顾问进行活动。去年二月，美国对外经济供应局并发表了“中国工业化指南”一书，拟定一个对中国矿业、工业及运输交通的广泛投资计划，规定五年中“协助”建立工矿业九百五十三个单位，投资九万万七千二百四十三万美金，对铁路、公路、河流交通投资八万万九千七百六十三万美金，两项合计为十八万万七千零零六万美金。这一计划的实现，将使中国国民经济的各部门为美国垄断资本所完全直接支配。同时，原来占有主要优势的英国资本，将被排除出去。在抗战结束后，除了美国原有的在华企业——如在背后由泛美航空公司所指挥的中国航空公司、洛克菲尔系的上海电汽公司、电话公司等等已经恢复旧观之外，上述美国的投资计划与各种投资活动，正在积极进行。美国的大托拉斯环球生产公司，已获得在中国西北探测与采掘油床的权利，戈壁沙漠已有二十五个油井在工作，每天出油四千桶。美国石油公司的一群人，正在成立特别企业组合（七月五日塔斯社电），美威斯汀好斯电气公司正与国民党政府订合同，在华设立大规模之工厂。中国最大的官商合办的轮船公司——招商局（现在拥有四十多万吨船舶），在战前即已与美国资本发生联系，在抗战结束后，该公司事实上乃为美国资本所支配，大批的管理人员与技术人员均使用美国人。所有权属于联总（联总的财产百分之七十五以上为美国所有）的中国水运大队已经成立起来，现有轮船二万多吨，计划达到二十多万吨。美国空军将领陈纳德最近组织了一个航空运货公司，并联合了中国买办官僚资本的三十多个代理人，发起组织“中国实业公司”，资本达十万万法币，两者将垄断中国一切重要进出口的商货采办与运输。中国实业公司并将在南京、芜湖、九江、汉口、长沙、衡阳等地设立分公司，自备车船运输商货。铁路与公路的运输事业投资，也在积极策划。此外，美国的纱厂、织造、造船、化学、水泥、麦粉等工厂，亦将在中国出现。
    通过了砂、锡、桐油等项借款的形式，美国资本已渐渐深入中国农村，直接掌握与攫取中国的原料——农产品。去年十一月，美国国务院所起草而在今年二月联合国经济社会理事会所通过的“国际贸易会议建议书”中，规定要中国在国际市场关系上，作为一个“原始商品”（按：即原料主要是农业品）的输出国，而中国所需的工业品则从外国输入。今年六月底，“中美农业技术合作团”已正式成立；团长此时生在谈到该团目的时说：将“特别着重研究中国出口之丝、茶、羊毛与桐油四种农产品之改良及增产方法”。中国正在成为美国垄断资本独占的原料供应厂。
    如上所述，美国反动的金融资本财阀，正在把中国变成为像拉丁美洲那样的国家，把中国从战前列强垄断资本共同支配的半殖民地，更变成其一国所独占的附庸国和殖民地。
    一百零五年以前，中国在鸦片战争中失败，订立了保证帝国主义对华输出商品的南京条约，使中国丧失了海关的壁垒。五十年前，中日战争我们又失败，在马关条约中，满清皇帝承认了帝国主义在华设厂的特权，使列强顺利遂行对华输出资本，并因此断送了中国民族资本的发展前途。三十年以前，卖国贼袁世凯承认日本帝国主义的二十一条，规定日本在华投资的广泛计划，但对其中规定中国须聘用日人为军事、政治、经济顾问，中日合办兵工厂及警察等的第五号条约，袁世凯也还有所顾忌，而不敢进行承认。现在中国在对日战争中赢得了胜利，中国解除百年来帝国主义列强的经济羁绊，独立地与顺畅地发展民族生产力的时机已经到来，但美国反动金融资本集团却获得了超过了南京条约、马关条约、二十一条的特权，这是依靠什么？这是依靠蒋介石反动派的“合作”。蒋介石反动派为着换得美国反动金融资本的军事干涉，作为维持独裁进行内战唯一的依靠，不惜拍卖整个民族的未来命运，而其拍卖的规模，大大超出了整个满清皇朝与袁世凯。
