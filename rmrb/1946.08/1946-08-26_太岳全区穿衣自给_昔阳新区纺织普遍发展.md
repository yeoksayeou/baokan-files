[Reported by this newspaper from Yangcheng] The Taiyue Liberated Area's military and civilians will be completely self-sufficient in clothing fabric this year. This year, the entire region planted a total of 300,000 mu of cotton. Since the start of the hot season, there has been ample rainfall, and the cotton seedlings are growing vigorously. It is estimated that each mu of mountain land can yield 20 jin of clean cotton, while each mu of plain land can yield 40 jin of clean cotton, for a total yield of 9 million jin of clean cotton. Due to the large-scale cotton planting throughout the region, the textile industry has also developed rapidly. Currently, there are 330,000 organized women spinners and 30,000 weavers in the region. The annual output is estimated at 8.25 million jin of spun cotton and 4.12 million bolts of cloth. For the region's 3 million population, this averages 4.5 zhang per person. The region will be largely self-sufficient in cloth this winter.

[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi] It has been a year since the complete liberation of Xiyang County. Both the county's cooperatives and women's spinning have experienced leaps in development. The old liberated areas have already achieved "cooperatives in every village, spinning in every household." The development in the new liberated areas is also extremely rapid. Even the women in the Chengguan district, who were formerly considered idle and degenerate after eight years of enemy and puppet rule, have joined the enthusiastic spinning movement.

Currently, there are 225 cooperatives in the county. Most cooperatives have developed from organizing transportation for profit to then developing spinning and weaving. Cooperatives in the old liberated areas have played a significant role in organizing mass production. For example, the Dongfengren Cooperative has not only developed rural sideline occupations but also increased livestock power and solved fertilizer problems for agriculture. As a result, it has been warmly supported by the masses, who call it "the overall manager of the village." Women in Xiyang did not traditionally spin or weave. Spinning and weaving in the old liberated areas began during the famine in 1932. After the county was liberated, the women's spinning and weaving work in both the new and old liberated areas developed rapidly under the call of our democratic government. Chengguan and the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 9th districts have all successively established spinning and weaving training classes. The trained women then return to their villages to hold small-scale village trainings. In the 1st district, the total number of women is 4,566, and 2,657 have learned to spin and weave, accounting for 56 percent. The number of spinning wheels and looms has doubled. Small-scale textile factories have been established in West Street in the city, Southeast Guan, and Haojia Village in Dongfengren. In order to study how to improve quality and technology, efforts are being made this year to achieve "self-sufficiency in clothing" in the old liberated areas and semi-self-sufficiency in the new liberated areas.

　　太岳全区穿衣自给
    昔阳新区纺织普遍发展
    【本报阳城讯】太岳解放区军民衣布，今年可完全自给。今年全区共植棉三十万亩，入伏以来雨水充足，棉苗茂盛，估计山地每亩可摘净花二十斤，平川地区每亩可摘净花四十斤，共可产净花九百万斤，由于全区大量植棉，纺织业亦迅速发展，现全区有组织的纺妇达三十三万人，织妇三万人，全年可纺花八百二十五万斤，织布四百一十二万匹，全区三百万人口，每人平均四丈五尺，全区今冬布匹即可大部自给。
    【本报长治讯】昔阳全境解放已一年，全县合作社与妇纺均有飞跃的发展。老区已是“村村合作社，户户纺花”，新区发展亦极迅速。连经敌伪八年统治，向称游堕的城关区妇女，也卷入了热烈的纺织运动。
    现全县合作社已达二百二十五个，大部合作社均系于组织运输获利后，继即开展纺织而发展的。老区合作社在组织群众生产上作用甚大，如东丰稔合作社不仅发展了农村副业，并为农业增加畜力，解决肥料，因之受到群众的热烈拥护，群众呼之为“村里的总当家”。昔阳妇女向不纺织，老区纺织开始于三十二年渡荒时。全县解放后，新老区妇纺工作在我民主政府的号召下，均一日千里的发展起来。城关及一、三、四、九等区均先后开办纺织训练班，再由受训妇女回村举办村的小型训练，一区妇女总人数为四千五百六十六人，学会纺织的就有二千六百五十七人，占百分之五十六。纺车、织布机倍增。城内西街，东南关及东丰稔郝家等村，均开办有小型纺织工厂。为研究提高质量与改进技术，今年完成老区“穿衣自给”，新区半自给而努力。（增誉、新颖）
