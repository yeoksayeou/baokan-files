Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 27th. The Kunming Student Union, representing over 30,000 middle school and university students in Kunming, has issued a "Declaration on the Current Situation," calling for an "immediate, comprehensive, and unconditional ceasefire to achieve lasting peace." The declaration pointed out that American aid "encouraged the war-mongering elements in China's civil war to have wild ambitions," and "in order to strengthen preparations for the civil war, the government did not hesitate to hand over China's sovereignty to foreigners, plunging the Chinese nation back into a colonial situation." The declaration stated: "We, the 30,000 students of Kunming, will never forget the 'December 1st' strike when we declared 'Oppose Civil War, Fight for Democracy to the End.'" We firmly believe that the power of the people can overcome everything. The anti-civil war parade of 100,000 citizens in Shanghai and the anti-civil war demonstration of 7,000 people in Hangzhou will become factors in reversing the situation. Let us unite and use all possible actions to save the country from its critical fate. Finally, we put forward firm demands: "(1) An immediate and unconditional ceasefire throughout the country to achieve lasting peace. (2) Implement the four promises and five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference to resolve national affairs through consultation. (3) Reduce the size of the army in accordance with the military reorganization plan to reduce the burden on the people. (4) Withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China and oppose U.S. military interference in China's internal affairs. (5) Increase education funding, stabilize the lives of teachers, and provide relief to unemployed youth. (6) Abolish student military training, abolish party-based education, and oppose teacher qualification. (7) Provide relief to disaster victims nationwide, stop the collection of land taxes in kind and the requisition of military grain. (8) Protect national industry and commerce, reduce taxes, and oppose the monopoly of the market by bureaucratic capital. (9) Safeguard national tariff sovereignty and oppose foreign ships navigating inland waterways. (10) Oppose the police district system and oppose the implementation of 'National Identity Cards.'"
