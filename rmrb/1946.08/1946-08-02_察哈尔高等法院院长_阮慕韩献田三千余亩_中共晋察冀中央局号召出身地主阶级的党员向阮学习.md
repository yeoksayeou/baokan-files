Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 29th: Comrade Ruan Muhan, President of the Chahar Provincial Higher People's Court and a member of the Chinese Communist Party, recently voluntarily donated more than 3,200 mu of his ancestral land in Huai'an to poor farmers for cultivation. Comrade Muhan comes from a prominent family in southern Chahar and is currently 45 years old. In his early years, he graduated from the潞河中学 (Luhe Middle School) in Tongzhou. Witnessing the poverty and bankruptcy of farmers in his hometown, he left in anger to study in Japan, hoping to find a way to save the country from danger. After returning to China in 1931, he served as a professor at universities such as Peking, Northeast, and Franco-Chinese University. At that time, he deeply felt that the CCP's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary cause was in line with justice, and he resolutely participated in revolutionary work, regardless of danger. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, he has felt even more deeply the extreme suffering and enormous contributions of the peasants, and he sincerely supports Chairman Mao's land reform policy proposed in the Report on the Coalition Government. Since this spring, he has repeatedly written to his friend, Mr. Ruan Baozhen, to discuss the donation of land. Mr. Baozhen, deeply understanding the great righteousness, is willing to contribute to this righteous cause. Comrade Muhan then went to his hometown in the latter half of this month and, together with his uncle, convened a mass meeting in Chaigoubu on July 23rd. At the meeting, he generously announced that, in addition to retaining a small portion for self-cultivation, he was willing to distribute all of his land to poor farmers for cultivation without compensation, and earnestly urged the villagers to step up production and live frugally. The farmers in the audience burst into thunderous applause, warmly welcoming this righteous act. The enlightened gentry present at the meeting were also moved and expressed their willingness to follow suit. After the meeting, Comrade Muhan immediately reported his land to the Sixth Commissioner's Office for distribution in conjunction with the local farmers' association. After receiving the report from the local Party committee, the CCP Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau sent a letter to Comrade Ruan Muhan to congratulate him, stating: "This further proves your revolutionary personality of serving the people wholeheartedly and sacrificing everything for the people since you dedicated yourself to the revolution and joined our Party. We will call on this part of the Party members who have moved from the landlord class to the proletarian position to learn from you." The Border Region Farmers' Association also issued instructions, representing the 30 million farmers in the entire Border Region, expressing warm support for this exemplary action, and calling on farmers to provide more economic care to political and civilian cadres and enlightened landlords who voluntarily donate land, so that the people of the Border Region can be more closely united and work together to develop the economy of the liberated areas.

    阮慕韩献田三千余亩         
    中共晋察冀中央局号召出身地主阶级的党员向阮学习
    【新华社宣化二十九日电】察哈尔省高等法院院长中共党员阮慕韩同志，顷自动将怀安原籍田产三千二百余亩，献交贫苦农民耕种。慕韩同志出身察南望族，现年四十五岁，早年曾毕业于通州潞河中学，因目睹家乡农民贫困破产的苦况，愤然出走赴日本留学，期望专求挽救祖国危亡的道路。一九三一年回国后，历任北平东北中法等大学教授，因当时深切体验中共反帝反封建革命事业合于正义，不避危难毅然参加革命工作。抗战以来，更深感农民所受痛苦至剧，所做贡献至巨，对毛主席论联合政府报告中提出的土地改革政策，更竭诚拥护。今春以来，曾屡函乃友阮葆忱先生商议献田之事，葆忱先生深明大义，愿共襄义举。慕韩同志遂于本月下旬到乡，协同叔父于七月二十三日在柴沟堡召集群众大会，当场慷慨宣布除留少部自耕外，愿将全部土地无代价分给贫苦农民耕种，且殷切嘱咐乡亲们加紧生产，勤俭持家。全场农民掌声雷动，热烈欢迎这一义举。与会各开明士绅亦受感动，表示愿追随其后。会后幕韩同志即将其土地报请第六专员公署会同当地农会分配。中共晋察冀中央局接获当地党委报告后，即致函阮慕韩同志奖贺内称：“这是进一步证明了你献身革命加入我党以来一贯为人民服务不惜牺牲自己一切的革命人格，我们将号召由地主阶级转到无产阶级立场上的这一部分党员向你学习”。边区农会也发表指示，代表全边区三千万农民对这一模范行动表示热烈拥护，并号召农民对自动献田的政民干部、开明地主等，应在经济上多加照顾，使边区人民更臻于亲密团结，合力发展解放区经济。
