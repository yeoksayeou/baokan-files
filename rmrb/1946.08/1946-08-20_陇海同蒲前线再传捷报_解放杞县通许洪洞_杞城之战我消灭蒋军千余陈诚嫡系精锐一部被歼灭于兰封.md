　　Another Victory Reported on the Longhai-Tongpu Front
    Liberation of Qi County, Tongxu, and Hongdong
    Over 1,000 Chiang Troops Eliminated in the Battle of Qi County; Part of Chen Cheng's Elite Direct Lineage Troops Annihilated in Lanfeng
    [Reported from Heze on the 17th by this newspaper] Our Eighth Route Army units, in coordination with local armed forces in eastern Henan, victoriously recovered Qi County town, the central county of the eastern Henan liberated area, in one fell swoop on the night of the 14th. Over 1,000 troops of the Chiang military's 81st Division of the 55th Army and the Kuomintang Qi County Security Regiment were completely annihilated, with numerous spoils captured. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. Note: Qi County was liberated by the Eighth Route Army, which persisted in the anti-Japanese resistance behind enemy lines in eastern Henan, last August, and was re-occupied by Liu Ruzhen's troops of the Kuomintang army in mid-October. The Chiang army constructed a moat around the city, with exceptionally solid defensive fortifications, but these were ultimately destroyed by the heroic Eighth Route Army soldiers, and the people of the entire city have regained their liberation.
    [Reported from Heze on the 17th by this newspaper] Our Eighth Route Army units recaptured Tongxu City at 11:00 AM on the 16th. The battle began at dawn, and of the Chiang army's security regiment of over 300 men, most were annihilated by our forces, with only a small number escaping. In this battle, 500 rifles, 3,000 rounds of ammunition, and countless other spoils were captured. Note: This city was liberated from the Japanese invaders by our eastern Henan Eighth Route Army on August 17th last year, and re-occupied by Liu Ruzhen's Chiang army on October 9th. The vast populace of the occupied area, who had suffered from the trampling and devastation of the Chiang army, are all celebrating the recapture. Order in the city is currently being restored.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 17th] Our correspondent on the Longhai Front reports: At 10:00 PM on the 11th, during the fierce battle between the Jilu Yu Eighth Route Army in self-defense and the Chiang army in Lanfeng City, a column of armored vehicles suddenly arrived from Kaifeng, carrying the direct unit of the 18th Brigade (formerly the 18th Division) of the 18th Division (formerly the 18th Army) of the Chiang army. This Chen Cheng's elite force, entirely equipped with American weapons, was largely annihilated near the station within minutes of engaging in fierce fighting. Note: This unit was personally commanded and trained by Chen Cheng during the ten years of civil war, and was a notorious anti-communist and anti-people armed force. It was originally responsible for guarding Wuhan, and recently, under Chen Cheng's cry for a "military showdown" with the Communist Party, was transferred from Hankou to attack the liberated areas of eastern Henan and northern Anhui. According to a captured officer of this unit, "Our mission in coming north was to attack the liberated areas and to monitor the miscellaneous troops. Unexpectedly, we were annihilated within minutes of engaging in battle."
    [Urgent telegram from Yangcheng on the 17th by this newspaper] After defeating the attack of the puppet troops under Zhang Conglong in Hongdong City, the Taiyue Eighth Route Army pointed its sharp edge westward and continued to liberate Hongdong County, a famous cotton and wheat producing area in southern Shanxi, on the 16th. Note: After the Japanese surrender, Hongdong City was still occupied by the notoriously sinful traitorous county magistrate Zhang Conglong. Later, Yan Xishan appointed him as county magistrate and reorganized Zhang's puppet troops into the Hongdong Corps. Since Zhang Conglong occupied Hongdong, he committed all kinds of evils against the people of the county, including arson, murder, and plunder, creating a "no-man's land" of several dozen li in Hexi and east and west Fengbao. This time, Zhang Conglong actually coordinated with the Chiang army offensive in southern Shanxi, attacking the Fengli area, fifteen li east of the county seat, on the 14th. The local military and civilians immediately launched a self-defensive counterattack that night, destroying strongholds such as Jiacun, captured Yufeng Mountain on the 15th, and entered the city at about 7:00 PM on the 16th. After two and a half hours of street fighting, Hongdong City was liberated by our Eighth Route Army. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. At the same time, our Taiyue Eighth Route Army launched an attack on the Yan puppet troops in Huoxian, capturing Xingzhi Station, twenty li south of Huoxian, on the 14th. In the battle, five blockhouses were captured successively, and two locomotives were seized. By 13:00 on the 15th, we had completely controlled the railway line for more than ten li north and south of the station. The results of the battle are still expanding. At this point, Zhaocheng is completely isolated.
    [Reported from Yangcheng on the 16th by this newspaper] Zhang Faquan, deputy platoon leader of the First Company of the First Battalion of Yan Jun's "Love the Hometown Corps" in Xiangling, unwilling to participate in the civil war, led his entire platoon in an uprising on the 5th of this month to oppose the civil war. However, because the matter was not kept secret, it was discovered by Yan's special agents, and the uprising failed. The entire platoon was disarmed. Platoon Leader Zhang Faquan seized the opportunity to escape with two squad leaders, carrying a machine gun, a rifle, and a grenade launcher, and defected to the nearby Eighth Route Army defense area to participate in the patriotic movement. Our local military and civilians warmly welcomed them.

　　陇海同蒲前线再传捷报
    解放杞县通许洪洞
    杞城之战我消灭蒋军千余陈诚嫡系精锐一部被歼灭于兰封
    【本报荷泽十七日电】我八路军某部配合豫东地方武装，于十四日夜乘胜一举恢复豫东解放区中心县份杞县县城，蒋军五十五军八十一师部队及国民党杞县保安团一千余人全部就歼，缴获甚多，战果正清查中。按：杞县去年八月为我坚持豫东敌后抗战的八路军所解放，十月中旬复为国民党军刘汝珍部所侵占，蒋军在该城构筑环城水濠，防御工事异常坚固，但终为英勇的八路军健儿所摧毁，全城人民重获解放。
    【本报荷泽十七日电】我八路军一部于十六日上午十一时光复通许城。战斗于拂晓开始，蒋军之保安团共三百余人，除少数突围逃走，大部为我歼灭。此役缴获步枪五百支，子弹三千发，其他胜利品无算。按：该城于去年八月十七日为我豫东八路军自日寇手中解放，十月九日为蒋军刘汝珍所侵占。此次光复，被占区之广大人民因受蒋军蹂躏摧残，莫不称庆，现该城秩序正在恢复中。
    【新华社荷泽十七日电】本社陇海前线记者报导：十一日晚十时，在冀鲁豫八路军自卫反击与蒋军激战于兰封城时，突从开封开来装甲车一列，载有蒋军十八师（原十八军）十八旅（原十八师）直属队。这支全部美械装备的陈诚嫡系部队，于展开激战数分钟后，即被大部歼灭于车站附近。按：该部为陈诚在十年内战中所亲手指挥训练者，为有名的反共反人民武装，原负责警备武汉，近在陈诚叫嚣要与共产党“武力决赛”的口号下，由汉口调来，向豫东淮北解放区进攻。据俘获之该部某军官称：“我们此次北来，一方面为进攻解放区，同时还有监视杂牌军之任务，不料在交战数分钟内就被歼灭了”。
    【本报阳城十七日急电】太岳八路军于击溃洪洞城内伪军张从龙部进攻后，锐锋西指，十六日继续解放晋南著名棉麦产区之洪洞县城。按：日本投降以后，洪洞城仍为罪恶昭彰之汉奸县长张逆从龙盘踞，后经阎锡山加委为县长，又将张逆伪部编为洪洞兵团。张逆自盘踞洪洞后，对该县人民烧杀掠夺，无恶不作，造成河西以及东西冯堡数十里之“无人区”。此次张逆竟配合晋南蒋军攻势，于十四日向县城以东十五里的封里地区进攻，当地军民即于是夜实行自卫反击，摧毁贾村等据点，十五日攻克玉峰山，十六日下午七时许攻入城内，巷战两小时半，洪洞城即为我八路军解放，战果现正清查中。与此同时，我太岳八路军分向霍县阎伪进击，于十四日攻占霍县以南二十里之幸置车站，在战斗中，先后攻下碉堡五座，缴获火车头两个。至十五日十三时，我已将该车站南北十余里之铁路线全部控制，战果仍在继续扩大中。至此，赵城已完全陷于孤立。
    【本报阳城十六日电】阎军襄陵“爱乡团”第一营第一连副排长张发全，不愿内战，于本月五日率领全排起义，反对内战，但因事机不密，为阎特发觉，致起义未遂，全排被缴械。张发全排长乘机随偕班长二人，携机枪一挺，步枪一支，掷弹筒一个，投奔附近八路军防地参加爱国运动，我当地军民予以热烈欢迎。
