Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Paris dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered his fifth speech at the Paris Peace Conference yesterday, condemning certain major powers for attempting to gain a monopoly position in the Mediterranean and trying to push Germany and Italy behind. Molotov said that this method is not beneficial to lasting peace in Europe, and both Germany and Italy should feel their responsibility as Mediterranean countries. Molotov was the first speaker at the plenary session, which resumed at 10:00 am yesterday. The agenda of the plenary session was to continue the debate on Italian Prime Minister Gasperi's statement. Molotov stated: Gasperi's statement did not denounce Mussolini and Italian Fascism, and the current Italian government has not implemented a genuine democratic policy, and the task of eradicating the last vestiges of Fascism is far from complete. Molotov continued: Gasperi wants to find a "reasonable" excuse for Italy's demands, especially for the demands including Trieste and the Julian region. The Soviet Union refuses to recognize any attempt to seize foreign territory, for the benefit of the Italian people. This kind of attempt is only a symbol of the expansionist tendency of certain narrow-minded people, and the Soviet Union refuses to postpone the decision on the relevant Italian reparations issue for another year. Gasperi's request is intended to create some differences of opinion among the Allies. Molotov finally pointed out: The Soviet Union has tried to limit the excessive demands of foreign capital on Italy, so as not to undermine the Italian economy, and the result of those demands will make Italy an economic slave of foreign trusts and cartels. As for the Soviet Union's reasonable reparations demands on Italy, they must never be regarded as equivalent to the former. Southern representative Biade continued to speak, expressing that the Southern government would never accept any of the three proposals put forward by the United States, Britain, and France on the Trieste Autonomous Region, because these proposals cannot give the people of Trieste any autonomous government. And if the decrees of those proposals are included as the laws of the autonomous region, this is the greatest irony. Biade declared: The Soviet proposal, which is very different from the other three drafts, is the only democratic plan; the Southern government is willing to use the Soviet proposal as the basis for negotiations.

　　莫洛托夫和会演说
    抨击意总理声明
    谴责某些大国垄断地中海企图
    【新华社延安十四日电】巴黎讯：苏外长莫洛托夫昨日在巴黎和会上发表第五次演说，谴责某些大国企图在地中海取得垄断的地位，并企图将德国和意大利推到后面去。莫洛托夫说这种方法对欧洲持久和平没有裨益，而德、意两国都应该感到自己作为地中海国家的责任。莫洛托夫是昨日上午十时续开的全会上第一个发言者。全会的日程是继续辩论意总理加斯贝利的声明。莫氏称：加氏的声明并没有痛斥墨索里尼与意大利法西斯主义，意大利现政府并没有实行真正的民主政策，根绝法西斯最后残余的任务远未完成。莫氏继称：加斯贝利想为意大利的要求，特别是对包括的里雅斯特与朱里亚区的要求找寻“合理”的借口。苏联拒绝承认任何想攫取外国领土的企图，是为了意人民的利益。这一类企图只是某些偏窄人士扩张趋向的象征，苏联拒绝将有关的意国赔款问题延迟一年再行决定的要求。加氏这种要求是想造成盟国间某些意见的分歧。莫洛托夫最后指出：苏联曾试图限制外国资本对意大利的过分要求，以免破坏意大利的经济，而那些要求的结果，将使意大利成为外国托辣斯与卡特尔的经济奴隶。至于苏联对意的合理赔款要求，则是绝不能与前者同等看待的。南代表彼亚德继续发言，表示南政府将绝不接受美英法对的里雅斯特自治区所提出之三个建议中的任何一个。因为这些建议不能给予的里雅斯特人民以任何自治政府。而如果把那些建议的法令包容做自治区的法律，这真是最大的讽刺。彼氏宣称：和其他三个草案差异极大的苏联草案，是唯一的民主方案；南政府愿以苏联建议案作为谈判的基础。
