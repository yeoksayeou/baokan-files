Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th. Democratic figures in Nanjing and Shanghai are deeply saddened by the death of Tao Xingzhi, a leader of the Chinese democratic movement and a people's educator. When Mr. Tao was dying, Shen Junru, Standing Committee member of the China Democratic League and leader of the National Salvation Association, and several old friends of Mr. Tao were at his side. Upon hearing the news, CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao immediately drove to his residence at 11:00 a.m. that day (the 25th). However, Mr. Tao had already stopped breathing, though his palms were still warm. Because of the sudden onset of the illness, he did not have time to leave a single word of testament. Zhou and Deng mourned deeply, and in the afternoon, they accompanied the body back to Nanjing. Overwhelmed by grief, they were unable to meet with General Marshall that day. Mr. Tao struggled throughout his life for the cause of people's democratic education, which had already damaged his health. Furthermore, the recent Lower Guan tragedy and the political assassinations of Li and Wen in Kunming occurred one after another, causing him excessive stimulation. In the days before his death, KMT secret agents suddenly went to his home to investigate his whereabouts, forcing him to live in a friend's house. On the eve of his death, he still disregarded his fatigue and talked to friends about the current situation. He eventually died of cerebral hemorrhage on the 25th due to excessive stimulation and fatigue.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th. It is reported that this spring, the Beiping authorities fully took over the puppet secret service. When Chen Lifu, Chen Cheng, and Dai Li successively arrived in Peiping for "official business," a certain publication said: "It is said that the mere mention of the Gendarmerie Headquarters terrifies the common people. After the recovery of the occupied areas, the people's terror is the same as it was under the Japanese Gendarmerie." When Chen Lifu arrived in Peiping to convene a meeting of senior personnel for instruction, a certain university professor stood up and recited a poem: "If this place does not keep me, there is always a place to keep me; if no place keeps me, I'll join the Eighth Route Army." Chen angrily said, "Do you also say that?" The professor looked calm and repeated the last two lines. On another occasion when Chen Cheng was giving instructions, the same professor recited as before. Chen took out a small notebook and threatened, "I've written it down!" The professor replied, "Write it down, it was said by so-and-so."

　　陶行知怎样死的？
    【新华社南京二十九日电】京沪民主人士对中国民主运动领袖之一及人民教育家陶行知氏病逝，莫不非常悲痛。在陶氏弥留之际，民盟常委、人民救国会领袖沈钧儒及陶氏生前老友数人在侧，中共代表周恩来、邓颖超两氏闻讯，立即于当日（二十五日）上午十一时驱车赶到时，陶氏已停止呼吸，惟手心尚有余温，因病发仓促，致未及留下片纸遗言。周、邓痛吊之余，于午后偕返南京，因悲恸过甚，致未克于当日与马歇尔将军会晤。陶氏奋斗一生，为人民民主教育工作，健康早已受损，复以最近下关惨案，昆明李闻政治暗杀案接踵发生，受刺激过甚，临逝前数日，又突有国民党特务前往氏宅调查其行踪，乃被迫寄居友人处。弥留前夕，氏犹不计辛劳，对友人侃谈时局，卒以过度刺激与疲劳，遂于二十五日以脑出血不治。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】据悉：今春北平当局，全套接收了伪特务机关，陈立夫、陈诚、戴笠相继到平“公干”时，某刊物说：“听说宪兵司令部，老百姓就吓破了胆，沦陷区收复后，老百姓的恐怖和日本宪兵在时一样”。当陈立夫到平召集高级人员训话时，某大学教授站起来朗诵一首诗道：“此处不留爷，自有留爷处；处处不留爷，只有投八路。”陈勃然道：“你也这么说么？”某神色自若，且重复后二句。另一次陈诚训话时，某朗诵如前，陈掏出小本子威吓说：“我记下了！”某答道：“记下吧，是我某某说的。”
