　　Kuomintang Plots to Strangle the Cultural Sphere
　　Poet Wang Yaping Flees to the Border Region
　　Recounts the Political Darkness and People's Suffering in the Great Rear Area
　　[Our newspaper, Heze, 14th dispatch] Progressive poet Mr. Wang Yaping, deeply angered by the Kuomintang's special agent oppression, arrived in Heze on the 9th of August after traveling from Chongqing. When this reporter visited him, I saw Mr. Wang's joy shining through his thin and haggard appearance, his eyes gleaming. He said: "The Kuomintang-controlled area has become a world of demons. Especially for cultural figures being tracked and persecuted, since the murders of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, the atmosphere is tense everywhere. Many cultural friends have nowhere to hide. The Kuomintang special agents registered the names of cultural figures, dividing them into four categories: The first category consists of those with higher status, greater prestige, and slightly older age, such as Guo Moruo and Zhang Shenfu; the second category consists of those who are younger, ideologically progressive, and have strong activity capabilities; the late Tao Xingzhi was the top name in this category, and the murdered Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo also belonged to this category; the third category consists of those with wavering thoughts and unclear understanding; the fourth category consists of those with muddled thoughts. The special agents believe that the first category is old and will not be active for long, so they are temporarily spared. The second category must be completely eliminated, leaving none alive. Li and Wen were the first two to be sacrificed. The third category is bought off with money and official positions. The fourth category is allowed to live. Chongqing has now practically implemented fascist police control, with three investigations a day. The special agents' blacklists are divided into red cards, black cards, and white cards. Those registered on the red cards are killed without exception, those on the black cards are subject to further investigation, and those on the white cards are temporarily spared. In early July, Chongqing Mayor Zhang Dulun hosted a meeting with special agent leaders, calling it a 'Rectification of Chongqing Morale' meeting. Wang Zanxu, Commander of the Chongqing Garrison, believed that only 'killing' could achieve rectification. Thus, after the murders of Li and Wen, a large number of progressive young students in Chongqing were killed and arrested. Now, more than forty magazines and newspapers in Kunming, such as the Democratic Weekly, have been shut down, and many magazines and newspapers in Shanghai have also been suspended because the authorities secretly ordered the printing houses not to publish them."
　　After a pause, Mr. Wang spoke angrily about his own situation. He said: "Even when I edited some poetry journals and wrote a few poems in Chongqing newspapers, special agents tracked me day and night. When I was about to leave Chongqing, Mr. Guo Moruo went to Shanghai, and I lived in Mr. Guo's house. On the 'July 7th' anniversary, the special agents planned a major disruption. On the 6th, a policeman in yellow uniform came to my house to 'visit.' He clearly knew I lived there, but he insisted on asking who lived there, what they did, and forced me to fill out a form, even asking which school I taught at. The next day was 'July 7th,' so I avoided it. On the evening of the 8th, the same policeman in yellow uniform came again, bringing two plainclothes men with short guns. They looked around and searched my house, asking this and that. One special agent said: 'Mr. Wang, your house is very nice. How about letting me live here?' I said: 'Where would I live?' The special agent said fiercely: 'Is it any of my business?' I knew the situation was serious, so I hurriedly packed my bags that night, and on the morning of the 9th, I had no choice but to leave." Mr. Wang said indignantly: "The special agents use terror to persecute writers and cultural figures, trying to destroy culture. However, Chinese culture will never be destroyed and regress; it is bound to move forward. The more it is destroyed and suppressed, the more it will develop forward. Even if all the bookstores and newspaper offices in the Great Rear Area are closed by the rulers, and all the writers and cultural figures are killed by the rulers, the culture of the Liberated Areas, the pioneer of this new Chinese culture, will continue to lead the culture of the Great Rear Area forward." Talking about the lives of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, Mr. Wang said with infinite emotion: "Everywhere there are wars and plagues, and the people have eaten up even the bark and roots of trees. I saw that most of the land in Sichuan was barren, and the young men were all drafted. The fields have long been uncultivated. If I met Sichuan brothers who were deceived into fighting the civil war, I would tell them: 'Your fields are covered with thatch, and your mothers and wives are crying their eyes out, waiting for you to return!'" Finally, when the reporter asked Mr. Wang what he thought after coming to the Liberated Areas, he said: "The Liberated Areas are paradise, which I have long admired. Although I have just arrived, and have not yet personally experienced the lives of the people, seeing the people smiling everywhere along the way, my heart has already been liberated."

　　国民党阴谋绞杀文化界
    诗人王亚平逃来边区
    备述大后方政治黑暗民不聊生
    【本报荷泽十四日电】进步诗人王亚平先生痛愤国民党的特务压迫，于八月九日由重庆辗转抵荷。记者往访时，见王先生在消瘦憔悴中显露喜悦之色，两目放光。他说：“国民党统治区已成鬼蜮世界。尤其是被追踪迫害的文化界人士，自从李公朴、闻一多先生被害后，到处风声鹤唳，许多文化界朋友无处藏身，国民党特务登记文化界之名单，分为四等：第一等地位较高，威望较大，年纪略老者，如郭沫若、张申府等；第二等为年纪较青，思想进步，活动能力强者，已死的陶行知为此等头名，被杀的李公朴、闻一多亦属此类；第三为思想动摇认识不清者；第四等为思想糊涂者。第一等特务认为年纪已老，活动时间不长，暂且留着。第二等则必须杀尽，不留一个。李闻就是被开刀的两位。第三等用金钱与官位收买。第四等让他活下去。现在重庆实际上已实行法西斯警管制，一日三查，特务登记之黑名单分为红卡片，黑卡片和白卡片，红卡片登记的仅杀无赦，黑卡片者待再考查，白卡片者暂时保留，七月初重庆市长张笃伦招待特务头子，开了一次所谓‘整顿重庆风纪’会议，重庆卫戍总司令王赞绪认为只有‘杀’字才能谈整顿，于是李闻被杀以后，重庆大批进步青年学生又遭杀害逮捕，现在昆明四十多杂志、报纸如民主周刊等，都被查封，上海也有许多杂志报纸，因当局密令印刷局不许出版而停刊。”
    停了一会王先生激怒的说到他自己身上来，他说：“就连我在重庆报纸上编些诗刊，作几句诗，特务也日夜来追踪着我，在将离开重庆的时候，郭沫若先生去了上海，我住在郭先生的房子里，‘七七’纪念那天，特务布置大捣乱，在六号，一个黄衣警察来我家‘访问’，明明知道是我住的，他偏偏要问是谁住、干什么的？硬要我填表，连在那个学校教书，也要填上去。第二天是‘七七’，我避开了。八日晚上又是那位黄衣警察，还带来两位夹着短枪的便衣，在我家里左看右翻，问这问那，一个特务说：‘王先生你房子可好，让给我来住好不好？’我说：‘我住到那里去呢？特务凶凶的说：‘老子管你？’我知道情势严重，当天晚上急急收拾行李，九号早上只好被迫出走了。”王先生愤慨的说：“特务用恐怖手段迫害作家文化人，想摧残文化，但是，中国文化决不会被摧残而倒退，她是必然向前推进的。愈是破坏摧残，愈是向前发展，就算大后方的书店报馆完全被统治者关闭，作家文化人完全挨统治者杀害，但是解放区的文化，这个中国新文化的开辟者，她将继续领导着大后方的文化向前推进”。谈到国民党统治区老百姓的生活，王先生无限感慨的说：“到处兵灾瘟疫，老百姓连树皮草根都吃净了，我看见四川的土地大部荒芜了，年青的都被抽了丁，田地早没有人耕，要是我遇见被骗来打内战的四川兄弟，我会告诉他：‘你的田都长着茅草了，你的母亲老婆望着你回来，都哭得没有眼泪了！’最后记者问王先生到解放区后有何感想，他说：‘解放区是天堂，已羡慕久了，虽然刚来，老百姓的生活还未亲身体验，但一路来看见老百姓个个笑逐颜开，我的心灵已经解放了。’”
