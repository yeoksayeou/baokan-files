Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 5th: American newspapers are criticizing the current US government policy towards China, advocating the withdrawal of US troops stationed in China, and the cessation of plans to arm and train the Kuomintang army. An Associated Press dispatch from July 23rd: The Philadelphia Inquirer commented on the Chinese situation on the 23rd, stating: "The renewed conflict between the Kuomintang and Communist armies is both dangerous and disappointing. We must continue our efforts to salvage the Chinese civil war. If materials under the US Lend-Lease Act are sufficient to fuel the war effort, they should be stopped, and efforts should be made to withdraw American troops. The Chinese people have suffered greatly, and the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists will only make this dire situation more hopeless. It is meaningless for the US Army and Navy to be involved." The St. Louis Post-Dispatch also criticized US policy towards China on the 22nd, stating: "If the United States immediately implements a ban on supplying arms and weapons to the Chinese Nationalist government, it will definitely be greatly beneficial." The Chicago Sun commented on the 23rd, advocating that the United States withdraw its troops in China, and that the plan to arm and train new Chinese armies should also be terminated.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 6th: TASS reported on the 5th: The Tianjin correspondent of the New York Herald Tribune reported: The US Marines stationed in China feel bewildered and troubled by interfering in the Chinese civil war; and deeply hope to receive orders from the US Navy to withdraw the Marines from China.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 5th: New York News: Following Soong Ching Ling's declaration on July 22nd, Carlson, Secretary-General of the American Committee for Peace, issued a statement to the press on July 27th, calling on Americans to pay attention to Soong Ching Ling's statement. Carlson also pointed out: It is a pity that the United States is encouraging the Chinese civil war, using American ammunition and weapons to eliminate organized political groups in China.

　　美各报抨击政府对华政策主张撤退驻华美军
    停止对蒋介石军事援助
    【新华社延安五日电】美各报抨击美政府现行对华政策，主张撤退驻华美军，停止武装及训练国民党军队计划。美联社七月廿三日电：费城通问报二十三日评论中国形势称：“国共两军又起冲突，此种转变既属危险且令人失望，吾人须继续努力，以挽救中国内战。美国军备租借法项下之物资，如足以助长战意，则应加以停止，并设法撤退美国军队。中国人民苦难已极，国共冲突必使此种水深火热情形更无希望解脱。美国海陆军置身其间，实无意义。”圣路易邮报二十二日亦抨击美国对华政策称：“美国禁止军火军器接济中国国民党政府，如果立即实行，必定有益甚大。”芝加哥太阳报二十三日评论，主张美国撤退在华军队，武装及训练中国新军计划亦应宣告终结。
    【新华社延安六日电】塔斯社五日讯：纽约前锋论坛报天津记者报导：美国驻华海军陆战队，因干涉中国内战而感觉惶惑困恼；并深盼接获美国海军陆战队自中国撤退之命令。
    【新华社延安五日电】纽约讯：宋庆龄于七月二十二日宣言发表后，美国争取和平委员会总书记卡尔逊七月二十七日对报界声明，号召美人注意宋庆龄的声明。卡尔逊并指出：很可惜，美国在鼓励中国内战，利用美国弹药武器去消灭中国有组织的政治集团。
