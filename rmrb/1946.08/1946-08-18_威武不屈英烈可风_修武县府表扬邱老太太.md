　　Unyielding and Upright, a Model of Heroism
    Xiuwu County Government Commends Old Mrs. Qiu
    [Our newspaper in Changzhi] The Xiuwu County Government recently issued an order to commend Old Mrs. Qiu of Ji Meng Village. On July 23rd, the Chiang troops stationed on the border of Xiuwu and Wuzhi launched a large-scale encirclement of Ji Meng Village in Xiuwu at night, blocking all passages into the village with six machine guns. The village militia and self-defense force fought bravely, but were eventually forced to disperse and hide due to overwhelming odds. At that time, three militiamen and five self-defense members sought refuge in the home of Old Mrs. Qiu. The Chiang troops discovered this, chased them into the Qiu house to search, and severely tortured Old Mrs. Qiu, demanding information. However, this old woman, over sixty years old, though covered in wounds, did not utter a single word. The Chiang troops, enraged with shame, shot and killed Old Mrs. Qiu, then looted and howled away. The entire village was moved to tears by the heroic death of Old Mrs. Qiu. On the 25th, the entire village held a funeral and public memorial service for Old Mrs. Qiu, with utmost sorrow and honor. All the militiamen and self-defense members swore an oath at Old Mrs. Qiu's grave: to defend their homes to the death, to strike at the Chiang puppets, and to avenge Old Mrs. Qiu.

　　威武不屈英烈可风
    修武县府表扬邱老太太
    【本报长治讯】修武县政府，顷明令表扬姬孟村邱老太太。七月二十三日，驻修武、武陟边境蒋军，于夜间大举包围修武之姬孟村，并以六挺机枪封锁村庄所有通路。该村民兵自卫队奋勇抵御，终因众寡悬殊，被迫分散隐蔽。当时有民兵三人，自卫队员五人，避入邱老太太家中，为蒋军发觉追入邱家搜索，并严刑拷打逼问邱老太太，而此六十余高龄的老人，虽遍体鳞伤，卒未吐一词。蒋军脑羞成怒，当将邱老太太击毙，抢掠呼啸而去。全村群众对邱老太太英勇的惨死，感激流泪，二十五日全村为邱老太太发丧，举行公祭公葬，备极哀荣。全体民兵、自卫队员，在邱老太太坟前宣誓：誓死保卫家乡，打击蒋伪，为邱老太太复仇。
