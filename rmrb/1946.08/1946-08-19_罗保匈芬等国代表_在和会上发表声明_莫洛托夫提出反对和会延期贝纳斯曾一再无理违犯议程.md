　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Paris dispatch: After the debate on Italian Prime Minister Gasperi's statement concluded, representatives of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland successively issued statements at the internal meeting of the Peace Conference. Romanian Foreign Minister Tatarescu delivered a speech on the afternoon of the 13th, expressing Romania's determination to implement the draft peace treaty. Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgiev delivered a speech on the morning of the 11th, declaring that Bulgaria's traitors had been severely punished by the People's Court; Georgiev believed that Bulgaria, like Italy, should have the same right to be regarded as a country at war with Germany. Regarding Greece's territorial claims against Bulgaria, Georgiev declared: Greece is attempting to invade Bulgaria and demand Bulgarian territory. Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyöngyösi spoke on the afternoon of the 14th, and Finnish Prime Minister Pekkala spoke on the morning of the 15th. The focus of both speeches was on territorial border issues and relations with neighboring countries. After the statements by the representatives of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, the plenary session proceeded with general speeches. Representatives of South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union all spoke yesterday afternoon. In his speech, Molotov formally raised his opposition to postponing the Peace Conference. Since yesterday, Wang Shijie, the representative of the Kuomintang government, has served as chairman of the plenary session (Note: The chairman of the plenary session is rotated among the representatives of France, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, each serving for four days).
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: TASS reported: The characteristic of the Paris Peace Conference on the morning of the 13th was that Benaš, acting as chairman, again violated the conference procedure without reason. On the 12th, after the US and British delegations failed to prevent the Soviet representative from speaking, Benaš declared that anyone wishing to speak would be put on the list. The Soviet representative was the first to request to speak. Benaš said: "I am very happy to put Mr. Molotov on the list of speakers for tomorrow morning," but when the meeting opened on the morning of the 13th, Benaš did not announce the agenda or the list of speakers, but suddenly said that he would not let the Soviet representative speak, but let the Abyssinian representative speak. It is said that the Abyssinian representative requested it earlier, although this was not mentioned on the 12th. Benaš's words were very strange, because the Abyssinian representative was absent at the beginning of the meeting and could not speak. Soviet representative Vyshinsky requested that the chairman should lead the plenary session in accordance with the procedure. He said that recent meeting experience showed that many misunderstandings arose because some representatives did not know what the agenda for the day was. Benaš replied with an unfounded statement that he had not yet received the agenda from the secretariat. Since the Abyssinian representative was still absent, Benaš had to invite Molotov to speak. The audience listened attentively to Molotov's speech and applauded from time to time.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Paris dispatch: The two subcommittees of the Italian Peace Treaty held their first meetings on the evening of the 13th. At the meeting of the Italian Political and Territorial Committee (First Committee), the United States and the Soviet Union again disputed over procedural issues. A few minutes after the meeting began, American representative Dunn suddenly proposed that the committee approve a motion not to elect any representative of a major power as the rapporteur of the committee. Soviet representative Vyshinsky said: We have no right to change the rules passed by the General Assembly. The dispute was inconclusive, and the election of the rapporteur was postponed. The committee has elected South African representative Egeland as chairman and Ukrainian representative Manuilsky as vice chairman. At its opening meeting, the Italian Economic and Financial Committee (Second Committee) also elected Indian representative Paul as chairman and South African Deputy Foreign Minister Biel as vice chairman.

　　罗保匈芬等国代表
    在和会上发表声明
    莫洛托夫提出反对和会延期贝纳斯曾一再无理违犯议程
    【新华社延安十六日电】巴黎讯：辩论意总理加斯贝利的声明结束之后，罗、保、匈、芬代表在和会内会上先后发表声明。罗外长塔塔列斯哥于十三日下午发表演说，表示罗国实行和约草案的决心。保加利亚总理乔吉也夫于十一日上午发表演说，宣称保国的卖国贼已为人民法庭严重惩处；乔氏认为保国一如意大利应同样有权被视为对德交战国。关于希腊对保的领土要求，乔吉也夫宣称：希腊企图向保加利亚侵略，要求保加利亚的领土。匈牙利外长吉恩约西马十四日下午演说，芬总理彼卡拉于十五日上午演说，两人之演说具以领土边疆问题及与邻国关系为中心。在罗、保、匈、芬代表声明之后，全会即进行一般发言。南菲、英国、法国、苏联代表具于昨日下午演说，莫洛托夫在演说中正式提出反对和会延期的意见。自昨日起，国民党政府代表王世杰担任全会主席（按：全会主席由法、美、中、苏、英五国代表轮流担任，每次四天）。
    【新华社延安十五日电】塔斯社报导：十三日上午巴黎和会的特点，是充当主席的贝纳斯再次无理的违犯会议程序。在十二日，当美英代表团阻止苏联代表发言的失败后，贝纳斯曾宣称凡愿发言者即将列入名单。苏代表第一个要求发言，贝纳斯说：“我很高兴的把莫落托夫先生列入明晨的发言人名单中”，然而在十三日上午开会时，贝纳斯并没有宣布议事日程或发言人的名单，却突如其来的说他不让苏联代表讲话，而让阿比西尼亚代表讲话。据说阿代表要求的更早，虽然此事十二日并未提到。贝纳斯的话是很奇怪的，因为会议开始时阿代表缺席，并不能发言，苏代表维辛斯基乃要求主席应有程序的领导全会，他说最近开会的经验，表明许多误会之产生，是因为一些代表因不知道当天的议事日程是什么。贝纳斯以毫无理由的声明回答说，他尚未从秘书处接获议事日程。由于阿代表仍告缺席，贝纳斯于是不得不请莫洛托夫发言，听众侧耳倾听莫洛托夫的讲话，并不时报以掌声。
    【新华社延安十五日电】巴黎讯：对意大利和约的两个小组委员会，于十三日晚首次集会。在意大利政治与领土委员会（第一委员会）的会议上，美苏两国又因程序的问题再起争辩。开会后数分钟，美国代表邓恩忽然提议请委员会赞同不选举任何大国代表担任该委员会的议案说明人，苏代表维辛斯基称：我们无权改变大会通过的规则。争辩无结果，议案说明人之选举于是展期举行。委员会已选出南菲代表厄吉兰任主席，乌克兰代表曼努意斯基任副主席。意大利经济与财政委员会（第二委员会）在其开幕会议上，亦推选印代表波尔为主席，南副外长比勒为副主席。
