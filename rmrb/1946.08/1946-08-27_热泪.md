　　Hot Tears
    Jin Sha
    The weeds in the courtyard were taller than Old Lady Zhang's neck. She painstakingly pushed them aside with her hands as she walked, and sometimes the weeds brushed her eyes, but her tear-dried eyes were like a dry well, without a trace of tears. She pushed open the tightly closed door, and a gloomy, pungent odor rushed out. The tables and chairs inside were overturned, missing legs and feet, and covered with a thick layer of dust, at least three inches thick, imprinted with several large handprints. This was the place where Zhang Conglong's subordinates' bloody hands had touched. These bloody hands killed the old men Li Caixin and Li Baotao in our village... drove away the people and livestock in our village... Old Lady Zhang trembled with anger and began to curse Zhang Conglong as she sat on the threshold.
    A burst of hurried footsteps outside startled Old Lady Zhang. Of course, it wasn't Zhang Conglong's troops from three days ago. Hmph! Zhang Conglong's troops could never come again. Old Lady Zhang knew that these were our troops. She quickly brought out a pile of peaches from her house and gave each of our soldiers one. The first soldier couldn't refuse and accepted it, and Old Lady Zhang couldn't close her mouth. But the second, third, and fourth soldiers smiled, shook their heads, and slipped past her. Old Lady Zhang became anxious, thinking: "Peaches are fuzzy, and our people are hygienic..." Old Lady Zhang hurried back to her house and went to her neighbor's house to wash them with water, but they still shook their heads and slipped past her. Old Lady Zhang became anxious and stammered, "You... you..."
    The troops didn't seem to notice. On the contrary, the word was passed from front to back, "Keep up," "Keep up," as if deliberately trying to make things difficult for Old Lady Zhang. Old Lady Zhang became really anxious. She jumped up and rushed into the ranks of the troops, shouting.
    "You must eat my peaches, you must eat my peaches..." She shouted frantically, but the troops continued to slip past her one after another. Old Lady Zhang couldn't stop them. She suddenly thought that our people were probably going to chase after Zhang Conglong! She thought: Drown Zhang Conglong in the Fen River, let him die stiff and straight! It would be even better to capture him alive and stab him to death inch by inch! Old Lady Zhang busied herself, frantically stuffing the peaches into the soldiers' hands. Suddenly, a rider passed by, and Old Lady Zhang had an idea. She grabbed the horse's reins and asked, "Why don't you let our people eat my peaches? This is my heart's desire..."
    The rider dismounted. He discovered two bright, crystal-clear teardrops in Old Lady Zhang's eyes, shining brightly. The teardrops fell from her old, wrinkled eyes onto the back of his hand, warm. Where could one buy this warmth with money? The rider felt as if he were in front of his own loving mother and was too moved to speak.
    "We must, we must eat them."
    The rider tightly grasped the old lady's hand, his own eyes also feeling warm. "Old Lady, our troops are rushing down to fight the enemy. We'll eat them when we come back!"
    Old Lady Zhang shook her head, stuffed two peaches into the rider's hand, turned and walked away, muttering to herself on the other side, "Eat them when you come back, there will be better ones..."

　　热泪
    金沙
    院子里的蒿子没过张老太太的脖子。她吃力地用手拔开走过去，有时蒿子稍碰着眼睛，但淌干了泪水的眼睛好像一口枯井，已经没有半点泪花了。她把紧闭的门推开，房里阴森森的，直冲出一股刺鼻的臭味，桌子椅子断腿少脚的东倒西歪，上面的尘土足足有三寸厚，印着几个粗大的手印。这是张从龙部下血手摸过的地方，这血手杀了咱村老汉李才新、李保桃……赶走咱村里的人、牲口……。张老太太气得发抖，坐在门坎上骂起张从龙来。
    门外一阵紧促的脚步声，熟悉的把张老太太惊动起来，当然这不是前三天张从龙的部队，哼！张从龙的部队永远不能再来了。张老太太知道这是咱们的部队，她赶忙从家中捧出一堆桃儿，给咱们的战士们一人一颗。第一个战士情不可却的接过去，张老太太的嘴合不拢来。可是第二个、第三个、第四个都笑了笑，摇摇头，从她身边溜过去，张老太太着急起来。心想：桃儿有毛，咱的人讲卫生……，张老太太急促促的走回去，走到邻家找水洗过后，可是他们还是摇摇头，从身旁溜过去。张老太太着急了，呐呐的说“你们……你们……”
    队伍好像没有发觉，相反的前面往后传：“跟上”“跟上”，好像故意和张老太太为难，张老太太真急了，她跳起来往队伍里冲过去，叫着。
    “你要吃我的桃儿，你要吃我的桃儿……”她发疯似的叫着，但是队伍还是一个跟一个的溜过去，张老太太是拦不住的。她忽然想到，咱们的人大概是去追赶张从龙吧！她想：把张从龙淹死在汾河里，死的直挺挺的吧，要是活捉住更好，一针一针的刺死有多好啊！张老太太忙碌起来，手忙脚乱的把桃儿塞在战士们的手里，忽然有个骑马的过去，张老太太计上心来，一把拉住马缰，问道：“你们怎么不叫咱们的人吃我的桃儿？这是我的心意呀……”
    骑马的人跳下马来，他从张老太太的眼里发现两颗亮晶晶的泪花，闪闪的发着光彩，泪花从枯老的眼眶上掉下来，掉在自己手背上，热热的这里有着无限的温暖，谁能用钱买到这温暖呢？骑马的像在自己的慈母面前，激动的说不出话来。
    “不能，一定要吃”。
    骑马的紧紧的握着老太太的手，自己的眼里也热热的：“老太太咱队伍赶下去打敌人，回来时再吃吧”！
    张老太太摇摇头，拿出两颗桃儿往骑马的手里一塞，转身走开，又在另一边自言自语说：“回来再吃，还有好的……”
