Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th - According to a special dispatch from the Ta Kung Pao correspondent in Paris on July 31st, Kuomintang Foreign Minister Wang Shijie delivered a speech at the Paris Peace Conference, emphasizing support for the Atlantic Charter. However, Wang's speech immediately drew criticism from some commentators. When Wang stated that "the victorious nations should not deprive the defeated nations of the opportunity to survive and consolidate their domestic democratic forces," some commentators asked, "Does the Chinese government also adopt the same liberal policy domestically?" Wang also said, "The victorious nations must strive for the peace of the people, not the peace of government representatives." Level-headed observers said, "China itself should abide by these resounding principles, and China itself is most in need of the peace of the people, not the peace of party representatives." Some observers even sarcastically said, "China is actually waging a civil war and still advocating world peace." It can be seen that it is very difficult for a diplomat representing a government that promotes dictatorial internal warfare to make a beautiful speech.

　　王世杰和会发表演说引起观察家批评讽刺
    【新华社延安十四日电】据大公报巴黎特派员七月三十一日专电中称，国民党外交部长王世杰此次出席巴黎和会发表了一篇演说，强调拥护大西洋宪章的宣言。但当王氏演说时立即受到若干评论家之批评。当王氏说到“战胜国不应该剥夺战败国国内民主力量生存和巩固的机会”，有些评论家就问：“中国政府对国内是否也采取了同样的自由政策？”王氏又谓：“战胜国必须争取人民的和平不是政府代表的和平。”头脑冷静的观察家说：“中国自己也应该遵守这种响亮的原则，中国自己才最为需要人民的和平，而不是各党代表的和平。”有些观察家甚至讽刺地说：“中国自己打着内战竟还倡什么世界和平。”可见代表推行独裁内战政策的政府之外交官欲作一篇漂亮的演说，也是很困难的。
