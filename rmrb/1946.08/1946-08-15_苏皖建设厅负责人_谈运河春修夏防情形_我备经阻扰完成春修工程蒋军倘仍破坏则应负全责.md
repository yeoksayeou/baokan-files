Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 11th: Recently, the water level of the Grand Canal has risen. Our correspondent, concerned about the safety of life and property of the people in the 25 counties along the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu, interviewed the responsible authorities of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Construction Department to inquire about the situation of the Grand Canal's spring repairs and summer defenses. We are pleased to publish their remarks as follows:

The Grand Canal, which stretches 600 *li* within the Border Region, underwent spring repairs under extremely difficult circumstances this spring, amidst severe drought and without any external assistance. During this period, it suffered from the Kuomintang reactionaries' rumor-mongering, sabotage, aircraft strafing, and economic blockade, but was finally completed on June 8th. A total of nearly 40,000 people were mobilized, with expenses amounting to 80 million legal tender. A total of 247 damaged embankments were repaired, 21 soil and willow revetment projects were built, 7 sluice gates and dams were repaired, and in the central section, dredging and beach restoration projects were carried out, involving a total of 482,865 cubic meters of earthwork. Due to the completion of the above projects, the Grand Canal embankment, which had been wantonly destroyed by the enemy puppets and Kuomintang troops during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and was in a fragmented state, has been completely transformed and restored to its pre-war flood control capacity. By adopting the policy of "work as relief," 150,000 disaster victims (including the families of the laborers) in 13 counties along the river were able to safely overcome the disaster. The excellence of the repair work has won praise from people from all walks of life both inside and outside the Border Region. Mr. Wu Xiangzai, a member of the Gaoyou County Council, said: "The Grand Canal donation that the Kuomintang government used to collect should be handed over to the current democratic government for use, and even iron embankments could be built." UNRRA experts Yan Feide and Bi Shufu, and TRA Ningxia-Suiyuan Branch Director Yao Tuda, all unanimously praised the project, saying that contrary to outside rumors, they did not expect such a huge project to be constructed under such difficult conditions.

Regarding summer defense projects, the Border Region Government has allocated a large amount of grain and funds to carry out repairs. On the other hand, the Kuomintang's loudly touted Grand Canal project has achieved nothing to date. In mid-March, when we were already organizing engineering, disposing of materials, and preparing to start construction, XXX shamelessly said at the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session: "The government has long been prepared to repair the Grand Canal, but the area north of Shaobo is controlled by the Communist army, causing much obstruction, while the area south of Shaobo is a national army area, where progress can be made without problems." By the end of April, when our earthworks in various sections had been completed and the rock filling project had begun, the project planned by the Kuomintang authorities had not yet started. And the Kuomintang reactionaries spared no effort to sabotage our repair work. During the spring repair period, Chiang's troops opened fire on our laborers working south of Shaobo and used aircraft to strafe our laborers working in Baoying. Since July, they have been continuously bombing and strafing the Grand Canal embankments in various places. Recently, Chiang's troops in Shaobo have also been constantly harassing, making it impossible for us to carry out summer defense work in the Shaobo area. The Kuomintang propaganda machine has been fabricating rumors and distorting the facts in every possible way. The Ta Kung Pao reported on June 21st: "The water level of the Grand Canal has been rising continuously in recent days, making it impossible to carry out repairs in the entire area. Whether northern Jiangsu can avoid the catastrophe of the inundation of the 20th year of the Republic of China can only be left to fate." This was a deliberate attempt to obliterate our spring repair work. A few days ago, Chiang's planes even dropped leaflets over Gaoyou, claiming: "The Communist army is destroying the Grand Canal embankment, causing flooding in the surrounding areas." They are trying to frame us and cover up their consistent sabotage conspiracy. If the repair project completed by our Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government after all kinds of hardships is hindered by the sabotage of Chiang's aircraft and troops, causing difficulties in summer defense and endangering the Grand Canal embankment, causing suffering to millions of people in northern Jiangsu, then the Kuomintang authorities should bear full responsibility.

　　苏皖建设厅负责人            
    谈运河春修夏防情形           
    我备经阻扰完成春修工程蒋军倘仍破坏则应负全责
    【新华社淮阴十一日电】近日运河水涨，本社记者以运河有关江北二十五县人民生命财产安全，特走访苏皖边区建设厅负责当局询问运河春修夏防情形。承发表谈话如次：
    边区境内全长六百里的运河，春修工程系在今春严重灾荒绝无外援的困苦情况下进行。其间备受国民党反动派造谣破坏飞机扫射及经济封锁之阻扰，但终于六月八日全部完成。计动员群众近四万人，用费合法币八万万元。共修复残破堤岸二百四十七处，修筑埽土护岸工程二十一处，修治闸坝七处，中段并进行拆坝修滩工程共计用土四十八万二千八百六十五公方。由于以上工程的完成，已使八年抗战中为敌伪及国民党部队姿意毁坏，陷于支离破碎的运河堤顿然改观，恢复到抗战前的防水强度。由于采取了以工代赈的方针，并使沿河十三县十五万灾民（连民夫家属在内）得以安渡灾荒。运修工程的精坚，博得边区内外各界人士的赞誉。高邮县参议员吴襄哉先生说：“要把过去国民党政府办的运河捐，交给现在民主政府使用，修铁堤也修起来了。”联总专家严斐德、毕叔甫，行总苏宁分署遥屠达诸先生，都一致赞许，认为与外间传闻相反，想不到在这种艰苦条件下能建设这样巨大的工程。
    关于夏防工程，边府已拨出大量粮款从事兴修。反观国民党方面，大肆叫嚣的运河工程迄今毫无所成。三月中旬，当我们已在组织工程处置办材料筹备兴工时，×××就在国民党二中全会上大言不惭的说：“修治运河，政府早已准备，但邵伯以北为共军所控制阻扰颇多，邵伯以南为国军地区进行可无问题。”到四月底，当我们各段土工均已完成开始填石工程时，国民党当局计划的工程还没有动手。而国民党反动派对我修复工作之破坏，则不遗余力。当今春兴修时期，蒋军对我在邵伯以南做工的民夫开枪射击，并用飞机对我宝应做工的民夫扫射。七月以来更对各地运河堤岸作连续性的轰炸扫射。近来邵伯蒋军亦不断出扰，使我们在邵伯一带夏防工作无法进行。国民党宣传机关反百般造谣颠倒黑白，六月二十一日大公报载：“运河连日水涨，全区无法兴修，苏北能否避免民二十年之陆沉浩劫唯有听诸一命。”有意将我春修工作一笔抹煞。日前蒋机更到高邮上空散发传单宣称：“共军破坏运堤，沿河一带受淹。”妄图嫁祸于我，借以掩盖其一贯破坏阴谋。我苏皖边区政府经历千辛万苦完成之运修工程，倘因蒋机蒋军之破坏阻扰，使夏防困难而致运堤发生危险，使苏北千百万人民受难，则国民党当局应负其全责。
