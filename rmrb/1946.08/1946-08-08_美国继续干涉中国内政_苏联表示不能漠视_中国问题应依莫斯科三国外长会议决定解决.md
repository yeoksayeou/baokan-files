Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: United Press, London, July 22nd: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 27th a lengthy article from "New Times" magazine reviewing American policy toward China, stating: The United States is fostering civil war in China in order to ensure its economic and political dominance in the Far East. The Soviet Republic cannot remain indifferent to such a policy of the United States in China. The United States regards its economic advantages in China as legitimate compensation for its war effort and views China as its new economic frontier. The main factor causing the Chinese civil war is the United States' assistance to reactionary figures within the Kuomintang in fighting the democratic movement. This is even more evident when observing the situation in China. The current American policy in China is drastically different from that adopted by the Roosevelt administration, which during the war, strived to promote Chinese unity. Now, the efforts of the United States are aimed at strengthening Chiang Kai-shek's power to counter the Communist forces. As a result, thousands of American soldiers are being forced to engage in an undeclared war for a reactionary and oppressive regime. Judging by the actions of the American military in China, it appears that the army is engaged in large-scale operations. The U.S. Seventh Fleet has concentrated in Qingdao, where military clashes are expected to occur. The commander of the U.S. Marines in Qingdao has even announced his intention to assist the Chinese government forces. A squadron of American warships in South China travels back and forth along the Yangtze River, using the pretext of maintaining order to assist the Chinese government in reinforcement efforts. This leads one to conclude that the United States has no intention of changing its policy of interfering in China's internal affairs. The ultimate goal of this policy is to promote American ambitions to not only establish economic and political bases in China but also to create strategic bases so that the United States can dominate the Far East. There is no doubt about this. The unanimous opinion of the Soviet Republic is that it is time to earnestly implement the decisions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference on China. These decisions established the minimum prerequisites for a satisfactory resolution of China's internal problems and the safeguarding of lasting peace in the Far East. Editor's note: This broadcast from Moscow Radio has attracted great attention in Chinese public opinion circles. On July 29th, the Dagongbao published an editorial entitled "The Harm of International Interference," which stated: "If the Chinese civil war does not stop, then another foreign ministers conference or similar international conference to discuss the China question and prevent American interference in China is not impossible." The editorial called for "quickly laying down the guns of civil war." Unexpectedly, this editorial in the Dagongbao incurred the displeasure of the Kuomintang authorities. Under the personal guidance of Chiang Kai-shek, the Guling Lixing Daily, in its third-day editorial, vehemently attacked the Dagongbao as "fugitives from justice" who needed to be "cleansed" and expressed its rejection of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference's decision on China's realization of peace and democracy, while also welcoming the presence of American troops in China.

　　美国继续干涉中国内政
    苏联表示不能漠视
    中国问题应依莫斯科三国外长会议决定解决
    【新华社延安五日电】联合社伦敦七月二十二日电：莫斯科电台廿七日广播“新时代”杂志检讨美国对华政策之长文称：美国正在培植中国之内战，俾确保其远东之经济及政治支配权。苏维埃共和国对于美国此种在华政策，殊不能漠然视之。美国已视在华经济优势为其作战之合法报酬，更视中国为其新的经济边陲。引起中国内战之主要因素，乃为美国协助国民党中反动人物与民主运动交战，此点就中国之事态观之，更为明显。美国现行在华政策，实与罗斯福政府所采行者迥然不同，盖在战时曾努力促成中国团结，现在美国之努力乃在加强蒋介石实力对抗中共军。其结果，美军盈千被迫为反动压迫政权从事不宣而战之战争。就在华美军之行动判断，若军正在大举行动，美国第七舰队已集中青岛，该区将发生军事冲突，青岛美陆战队司令且已宣布其协助中国政府军之意向。华南美舰一队往返长江，借口维持治安，协助中国政府增援事宜，令人不得不推断美国无意改变其干涉中国内政之政策。而此种政策之远大目的，乃为促进美国野心，在华不但建立经济与政治根据地，更拟造成战略根据地，以便美国得以支配远东，实无疑问。苏维埃共和国之一致意见，认为切实实现莫斯科外长会议对华各项决议，此其时也。盖是项决议曾有圆满解决中国国内问题及保障远东持久和平之最低限度先决条件。编者按：莫斯科电台这一广播，引起了中国舆论界的极大注意。七月二十九日，大公报曾为此发表社论，题为“国际干涉之害”，内称：“若中国内战不停，则再来外长会议或类似的国际会议讨论中国问题，阻止美国干涉中国问题也不是不可能的”。该社论呼吁“快放下内战的枪”。不料大公报这篇社论竟遭了国民党当局之忌，在蒋介石亲自指导之下，牯岭力行日报于其三日社论中，大骂大公报为“畏罪之徒”，有“冲洗”之必要，并表示不承认莫斯科三外长会议关于中国实现和平民主的决定，和表示欢迎美军驻华。
