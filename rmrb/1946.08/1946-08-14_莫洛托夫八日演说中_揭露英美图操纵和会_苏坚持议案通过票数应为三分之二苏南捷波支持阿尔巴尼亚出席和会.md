Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 10th: The following is a summary of Molotov's speech at the plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference on August 8th: The Soviet delegation disagrees with the decision of the Rules of Procedure Committee. According to this decision, the conference should vote on its motions by a simple majority, rather than by a two-thirds majority as suggested by the Council of Foreign Ministers. We disagree that the conference can pass important motions by a simple majority, i.e., eleven delegations forcing ten delegations to accept important motions. The Soviet delegation believes that this decision is wrong and firmly insists that the committee's erroneous decision must be corrected. The rules of procedure are very important issues at international conferences. This conference must express its views on many serious issues. Seeking unity among all participants at international conferences is a guiding principle, of course, this is not a simple matter. But since we are gathered here, we should seek unity, seek mutual understanding, and seek reasonable compromises; and we must understand that any other method will not produce good results when solving international problems. The principle of seeking consensus in passing all resolutions has been repeatedly adopted by international organizations in the past and now. All decisions at the conferences of major powers during the war were passed after mutual agreement. The Council of Foreign Ministers, established by the Berlin Conference, also carried out all its work on the basis of complete unanimity. Only those with very short sight would think that useful results can be obtained in dealing with international affairs without seeking the consensus of the countries concerned.

The Council of Foreign Ministers submitted to the conference a proposal on the rules of procedure for voting in the plenary sessions and committees of the conference. The proposal reads as follows: "Decisions of the conference on procedural matters shall be passed by a simple majority vote, and decisions and recommendations on all other matters shall be passed by a two-thirds majority vote." The Council of Foreign Ministers spent some time to reach a consensus on this point. I must admit that the Soviet Union particularly insisted on this point. However, the British delegation submitted an amendment to the Rules of Procedure Committee. This proposal was opposed by several delegations, but it has been passed by the committee. The original text is as follows: "The conference's recommendations can be divided into two parts: (1) those passed by a two-thirds majority; (2) those approved by a simple majority but less than a two-thirds majority. Both types of recommendations will be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for consideration." This proposal cancels the Council of Foreign Ministers' proposal on the voting rules of the conference. Everyone knows that the conference's recommendations cannot order the Council of Foreign Ministers; on the other hand, we all admit that it is beneficial to allow the conference to make certain recommendations, which will help the final peace. Our insistence that motions must be passed by at least a two-thirds vote is not concerned with the number of votes, but with the hope of seeking consensus for the conference through this voting method. The political significance of the Council of Foreign Ministers' proposal that important issues must be passed by two-thirds is precisely this. The decision of the Rules of Procedure Committee overturns this proposal, it ignores the need to strive for unanimous decisions, which will disrupt the entire work of the conference. The responsibility for why the Rules of Procedure Committee allowed this error lies with the British delegation that moved this proposal and the American delegation that actively supported this proposal in the Rules of Procedure Committee, hoping that they can ensure that the conference passes the proposals they want. After a long discussion, the Council of Foreign Ministers passed an agreed resolution, but at the conference, the US and British delegations abandoned this agreed resolution and returned to their original proposal, that is, the conference passes recommendations by a simple majority.

Everyone knows that when it was necessary to fight our common enemy, the Soviet Union did not stand in the last row among the Allies. The Soviet Union is proud of the fact that it has saved European civilization from the fascist beast. In this struggle, the Soviet Union has made unprecedented sacrifices. We have lost seven million people. The merits of the Red Army and the inestimable losses of the Soviet Union make it our responsibility to remind everyone here that the voices of the Soviet Union and other democratic countries have urged a consistent procedure on international issues, and this voice is worthy of everyone's attention.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: The conference continued at 10:00 am on the 11th to discuss the issue of Albania's participation in the conference. Albania's request to attend the plenary session and the committees related to the peace treaty with Italy was supported by the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The Soviet Union supported Albania's request to participate in the conference, because Albania helped the Allies with its resistance movement. Benes suggested on the evening of the 10th that this issue be submitted to the Steering Committee of the conference. Alexander (acting head of the British delegation) expressed his agreement. Benes said: The chairman claimed last night that he had received applications from Mexico, Egypt, and Cuba. If the invitation includes these countries, he is willing to accept the Czech proposal (Note: The Czech proposal is that Albania, as an ally and a neighbor of Italy, expresses its views at the plenary session of the conference and the Committee on the Italian Peace Treaty). Benes' proposal was immediately accepted by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, but this issue was still postponed to the 12th for formal discussion and voting. During the discussion, because the Greek representative unreasonably opposed Albania's participation, the Yugoslav representative, Bijedic, immediately denounced: Since the conference, Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris had privately suggested to him in Paris that "Yugoslavia and Greece jointly divide Albania", and accused Greece of constantly pursuing a policy of creating wars in the Balkans, and that the Greek government had not abandoned this policy. He said that after all the historical lessons, it was shocking that Greece still intended to destroy Albania, and this was the motive for preventing Albania from participating in the conference. When the Yugoslav representative was about to finish his speech, Tsaldaris immediately stood up to try to quibble, but Chairman Bidault pointed out that Greece had violated the procedure, but Tsaldaris still did not stop speaking, and Bidault recognized it. Soviet representative Vyshinsky and Czech representative Kader formally proposed a motion in favor of Albania's request to interrupt Tsaldaris' speech. The plenary session on the 11th also discussed the draft of the Four Powers' Peace Treaty with Italy.

### 莫洛托夫八日演说中  揭露英美图操纵和会  苏坚持议案通过票数应为三分之二苏南捷波支持阿尔巴尼亚出席和会

　　莫洛托夫八日演说中            
    揭露英美图操纵和会         
    苏坚持议案通过票数应为三分之二苏南捷波支持阿尔巴尼亚出席和会
　　【新华社延安十日电】八月八日莫洛托夫在巴黎和会全体大会的演说，摘要如下：苏联代表团不同意程序规则委员会的决定。按这一决定，和会应以过半数票表决其议案，而不是按外长会议的建议应有三分之二多数通过。我们不同意和会可以一票的多数就通过其议案，即十一个代表团迫使十个代表团接受重要的议案。苏联代表团认为这一决定是错误的，并坚决主张该委员会的错误决定必须改正，表决规则在国际会议上是很重要的问题。本次会议必欲对许多严重问题表明其观点，在国际会议上求取全体与会者的团结一致，是一个指导原则，当然这并不是一件简单的事。可是我们既然集于一堂，我们就应该求得一致，求得互相谅解，求得互相合理的让步；而且必须了解解决国际问题时，用别的任何办法是得不到好结果的。在通过一切决议时求取一致的原则，过去和现在都为国际组织所屡屡采用，战争期间一切强国会议上的一切决定，都是经过互相同意之后才通过的。柏林会议所创立的外长会议，其全部工作也是在完全一致的基础上实行的，惟有目光十分短浅的人，才会以为在处理国际事务时，不用求得有关各国的意见一致也可以得到有用的结果。
    外长会议向和会提出了关于和会全体会议和委员会上表决规则的建议，该建议内容如下：“和会关于程序性质问题的决定，应以过半数票通过之，关于其他一切问题的决定及建议，则应以三分之二票通过之”。为对这点求得一致意见，外长会议很费了一些时间。我应该承认，对于这一点苏联特别坚持，可是英国代表团却在程委会上提出了修正案，这提案曾引起若干代表团的反对，但业由该委会通过，其原文如下：“和会的建议案可分为两部：（一）经三分之二多数通过者，（二）经过半数、但在三分之二以下票数赞同者。两种建议都将交给外长会议审议”。这一建议，取消了外长会议关于和会表决规则的建议。我们每一个人都知道，和会的建议案，对于外长会议并不能下命令；另一方面，我们大家都承认，让和会提出某些建议案是有好处的，有助于最后和平的。我们之坚持议案必须至少三分之二票数通过，它所关心的不重投票的数目，而是希望以此表决方法来为和会求得一致。外长会议之建议重要问题必须三分之二通过的政治意义正在于此。程委会的决定，推翻了这一建议，它忽略了争取一致决定的必要性，这将会搅乱整个会议的工作。程委会为什么允许这种错误，其责任在于动议这一建议的英国代表团及在程委会中积极支持这一建议的美国代表团，希望他们能够保证会议通过他们所希望的建议。外长会议在长期讨论之后，通过了协议的决议，可是在会议上，美英代表团都抛弃了这一协议的决议，回至他们原来的建议，即会议以过半数通过建议。
    大家知道，当必须和我们的共同敌人作战的时候，苏联在盟国中并没有站在最后一排，苏联因为它曾从法西斯野兽手中拯救过欧洲文明的事实而感到骄傲。在这次斗争中，苏联曾经作了前所未闻的牺牲，我们曾经损失了七百万人，红军的功勋以及苏联不可估计的损失，使得我们有责任在这里提醒大家，苏联以及其他民主国家的呼声，曾敦促在国际问题上采取一致的程序，这种呼声是值得大家听取的。
    【新华社延安十一日电】和会十一日上午十时续开，讨论阿尔巴尼亚参加和会问题。阿尔巴尼亚要求出席全会及与对意和约有关的各委员会之声请，获得苏、南、捷、波的支持，苏联以阿国曾以其抵抗运动帮助盟国，故支持该国参加和会要求。贝纳斯十日晚建议将此问题提交和会指导委员会，亚历山大（英代表团代团长）对此表示赞同。贝纳斯称：前晚主席声称曾接到墨西哥、埃及、古巴之申请，倘邀请中包括这些国家在内，则愿意接受捷克之建议（按：捷克建议为阿国以盟国与意大利邻国的资格在和会全会及对意和约委员会上发表其意见）。贝纳斯之提议旋为苏、捷两国所接受，但此一问题仍延至十二日正式讨论表决。在讨论过程中，因希腊代表无理反对阿国参加，南代表彼犹德即席指斥：自和会以来，希腊总理曹德利斯曾在巴黎私自向他建议，“由南国与希腊共同瓜分阿国”，并指斥希腊经常奉行在巴尔干制造战争之政策，而希腊的政府也未放弃这种政策。并谓经过一切历史教训后，希腊仍蓄意灭亡阿国，实令人震惊，而这就是阻止阿国参加和会的动机。南代表发言将毕时，曹德利斯立即起立拟施狡辩，主席比道尔乃指出希腊违反程序，然曹德利斯仍不中止发言，比道尔遂认可。苏代表维辛斯基及捷代表卡德尔正式提出赞同阿国要求之提案，以打断曹德利斯发言。十一日全会并讨论四强对意和约草案。
