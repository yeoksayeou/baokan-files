　　Anyang County Party Committee Instructs All Districts: Persist in Production During Mass Movements

　　[This newspaper, Anyang News] The Anyang County Party Committee recently issued an urgent directive calling for persisting in production during mass movements. The directive praised the practice in some areas of arranging for airing grievances while engaging in production during the day, holding meetings at night to resolve problems, and promptly distributing unmanaged land to poor farmers to boost the masses' enthusiasm for production and deepen the land reform movement. At the same time, it pointed out that the serious phenomena of neglecting production in favor of mass movements, ignoring the distribution of barren land, and failing to quickly achieve the fruits of struggle, thereby hindering production, should be overcome immediately. (1) Grasp the policy of combining mass movements with production and the principle of not violating the farming season. (2) Organize temporary mutual aid to rush weeding and replanting, organize women and children to participate in production to make up for the shortage of male labor, and solve the production difficulties of cadres, activists, and militia members participating in the war. (3) Quickly replant barren land with autumn vegetables. Finally, it called on all districts and villages to create new experiences and good methods for "combining mass movements with production," conduct specific inspections in some typical villages, and quickly seek improvements.

　　安阳县委指示各区            
    群运中坚持生产
　　【本报安阳讯】安阳县委顷发出紧急指示，号召在群运中坚持生产。该指示表扬有些地区白天生产酝酿诉苦，黑夜开会解决问题，并及时分配无人经营的土地给贫苦农民，以提高群众生产情绪深入土地改革运动的作法。同时指出应立即克服顾群运不顾生产，忽视分配荒芜土地，及未能迅速取得斗争果实，因而妨碍生产的严重现象。（一）掌握群运与生产结合的方针及不违农时的原则。（二）组织临时性互助，突击锄苗补种，组织妇女儿童参加生产，补足男劳力之不足，并解决干部、积极分子及参战民兵的生产困难。（三）已荒土地迅速改种秋菜。最后号召各区、村创造“群运与生产结合”的新经验和好办法，并在一些典型村中进行具体检查，迅速求得改进。
