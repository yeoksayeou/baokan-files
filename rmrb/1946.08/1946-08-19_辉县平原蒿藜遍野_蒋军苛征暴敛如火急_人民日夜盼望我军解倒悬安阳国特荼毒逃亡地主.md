　　The plains of Huixian County are Covered with Wormwood
　　 Chiang's Army's Harsh Taxes and Levies are as Urgent as Fire
　　 The People Yearn Day and Night for Our Army to Rescue Them from Their Plight; Kuomintang Special Agents in Anyang Poison and Harm Refugees and Landlords
　　[This Dispatch from Changzhi] The people in the Huixian plain area, which serves as the reactionary faction's forward position for attacking the liberated areas, have suffered unprecedented war disasters. Nine out of ten homes are empty, and the area is covered with wormwood. According to the Kaifeng China Times, "Large armies (referring to Chiang's army) are gathered in the area, and the supplies are enormous, and the people's cries of suffering are endless." Due to military service occupying farmland, this year's summer wheat yield is only four dou per mu at most. However, before the wheat is even dried, the Baozhang (village head) is already going door to door urging the payment of military grain, amounting to three and a half dou per mu. The issue of wheat seeds for this autumn has become a major problem. There are more than thirty types of apportionments in the villages. In Guzhang Village, which has more than 200 households, more than 7,000 jin of wheat, more than 20,700 jin of millet, 1,000 jin of cotton yarn, 650 zhang of homespun cloth, 280 jin of cotton, 40 pairs of military shoes, 100 bullets, and 130,000 yuan (legal tender) were collected in just over three months. Other requisitions such as bricks, tiles, wood, and adobe for building bunkers, as well as the requisition of vegetables and firewood, etc., amount to more than 1.15 million yuan (legal tender). Items such as tables, chairs, basins, bowls, clothing, and bedding that were requisitioned are not included. Many strong men have been forcibly conscripted, and the old and weak must also serve in the labor force. Most of the twenty qing of land in Guzhang is barren. The local people live in hardship, robberies are increasing daily, and they yearn day and night for our army to rescue them. (Zhou Zhenshan, Jun)
　　[Dispatch from Handan, 15th] Refugees and fleeing landlords returning to the liberated areas via Anyang are often detained and obstructed by Kuomintang special agents. Kuomintang special agents use all sorts of despicable means such as threats, inducements, rumors, and intimidation to prevent them from returning to their hometowns. When their plots fail, they use counterfeit Hebei currency to forcibly exchange the legal tender they carry. The Kuomintang special agents have two aims: first, to defraud them of their money and prevent them from returning home; second, to promote counterfeit currency through them and disrupt the financial market in our liberated areas.

　　辉县平原蒿藜遍野
    蒋军苛征暴敛如火急           
    人民日夜盼望我军解倒悬安阳国特荼毒逃亡地主
    【本报长治讯】作为反动派进攻解放区前进阵地的辉县平原地区，人民遭受了空前的兵灾，十室九空，蒿藜遍野。据开封中国时报载称：“该地大军（指蒋军）云集，供应浩繁，人民叫苦之声不绝于耳”。由于军差荒地，今年夏麦每亩最高仅收四斗，但麦子尚未晒干，保长即沿门催缴军粮，每亩达三斗半，今秋麦种已成大问题。村中各种摊派有名目者达三十余种。二百多户的古章村，三个多月即征麦子七千余斤，小米二万零七百多斤，花料千斤，土布六百五十丈，棉花二百八十斤，军鞋四十双，子弹一百发，款十三万元（法币），其他征派建筑碉堡之砖瓦，木料，土坯以及征发菜蔬、柴草等物折合法币达一百一十五万余元之巨。而被征发之桌椅，盆碗，衣被等物尚不在内。壮丁多被强征，老弱还须应差，古章二十顷土地大部荒芜。当地人民生活困苦，劫案日多，日夜盼望我军去解救他们。（周振山、军）
    【邯郸十五日电】经安阳回解放区之难民及逃亡地主，经常为国民党特务扣留阻难。国民党特务以威胁、利诱、造谣、恐吓等种种卑鄙手段阻碍彼等还乡，奸计不售时即以伪造之冀钞强换彼等所带之法币。国特之企图有二：一为诈骗钱财，使彼等不得返乡；一为通过彼等推行假钞，扰乱我解放区金融市场。
