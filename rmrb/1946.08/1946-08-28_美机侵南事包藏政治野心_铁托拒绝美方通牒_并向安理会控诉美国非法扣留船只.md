　　U.S. Planes Intrusion into Southern Incident Conceals Political Ambitions;
　　Tito Rejects U.S. Ultimatum
　　and Accuses the U.S. to the Security Council of Illegally Detaining Ships
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] Comprehensive reports: The U.S. authorities have recently taken a series of actions threatening the People's Republic of Yugoslavia. According to two notes from Yugoslavia to the U.S. on August 14th and August 20th, "Since July 16th (that is, the fourth day after the end of the Second Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, at which the four foreign ministers accepted the French proposal on the Italian-Yugoslav border), U.S. aircraft have systematically intruded into Yugoslav airspace 216 times in 35 days." At 1:00 PM on August 9th, U.S. "BA" No. 47 aircraft appeared again over the Yugoslav Ubuna Airport at an altitude of 1,000 feet and was forced to land by Yugoslav fighter planes. However, on the night of the 21st, Azerson delivered an ultimatum to the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires in the U.S., Makido, demanding in extremely rude terms that Yugoslavia release the U.S. aircrew detained on August 9th within 48 hours of receiving it, and threatening Yugoslavia with a request for "sanctions" from the Security Council.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th] Belgrade News: Yugoslavia has refused to accept the U.S. ultimatum. Belgrade Radio quoted a statement from the Secretariat of the People's Republic of Yugoslavia on the 23rd, saying that Marshal Tito refused to accept the U.S. ultimatum, because the U.S. pilots who were forced to land on August 9th after intruding into Yugoslav airspace had already been released almost as soon as the U.S. ultimatum arrived in Belgrade, and Yugoslavia had agreed that the U.S. could come to Yugoslavia to repair its second crashed aircraft on August 19th themselves. Marshal Tito made the following statement to a Yugoslav interviewer from the London Daily Telegraph on the 23rd: "I believe that the U.S. aircraft deliberately violated our airspace in order to create the impression that the U.S. power is so overwhelming that the Yugoslav government will be forced to endure everything. When entire teams of aircraft circle our airspace, this is a very obvious fact." Marshal Tito also rebuked U.S. military aircraft for intentionally scouting Yugoslav military equipment on the Italian border when answering reporters from the Associated Press on the 24th. Tito declared: One of the purposes of this illegal flight over Yugoslavia is to scout our garrison defense zones and borders.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] New York News: The Chairman of the National Peace Conference announced that retired Marine Corps Colonel Carlson issued a statement to the press on the 3rd, saying that the U.S. ultimatum to Yugoslavia was imitating the methods used to deal with Greece, Palestine, and Transjordan. The threat of force is being used to support the sharp words published in Paris and Washington, which not only order the defeated countries of World War II, but also order the victorious countries to submit to Anglo-American peace.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th] It is reported that Yugoslavia has submitted the matter of the U.S. illegally detaining Yugoslav ships to the Security Council on the 23rd. The Yugoslav representative to the Vice-Chairman of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, Sformel, sent a letter to Secretary-General Lai Shi on the 23rd, requesting that the agenda of the next meeting of the Security Council should include the issue of the U.S. illegally detaining Yugoslav ships. There are a total of 171 ships mentioned above, most of which are ordinary mail ships, which were detained by the U.S. authorities in the U.S. occupied areas of Germany and Austria when they occupied Germany. On the same day, U.S. officials claimed that if Yugoslavia agrees to the international co-management of the Danube River plan proposed by the U.S. at the peace conference, the U.S. will release these ships. Regarding this statement, the Belgrade "Glas" newspaper called it a political conspiracy and an unprecedented threat.

　　美机侵南事包藏政治野心
    铁托拒绝美方通牒
    并向安理会控诉美国非法扣留船只
    【新华社延安二十四日电】综合报导：美国当局日前采取一连串的威胁南斯拉夫人民共和国的行动。据八月十四日与八月二十日南致美国两次照会称：“七月十六日（按即第二次巴黎外长会议结束后第四日，在这次会议上，四外长曾接受法国关于意南边界的建议）以来，三十五天之内，美国飞机有组织的擅自侵入南国领空者达二百十六架。”八月九日下午一时，美“ＢＡ”四七号机又出现在南国乌布那机场一千英尺高空，被南国战斗机迫使着陆，讵二十一日夜间，亚泽逊即以最后通牒交南驻美代办马基多，以极其蛮横的措词要南国于接到后四十八小时之内释放八月九日被扣之美机人员，并以提请安理会“制裁”南国相恫吓。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫已拒绝接受美国的最后通牒。贝尔格莱德电台于二十三日引证南斯拉夫人民共和国秘书处声明称：铁托元帅拒绝接受美国最后通牒，因八月九日侵入南国领空而被强迫降落之美飞行员，几与美方最后通牒交到贝尔格莱德拉时即已释放，且南国已允美国得来南国将其八月十九日第二架坠毁之飞机自行装修。铁托元帅于二十三日对伦敦每日电讯报驻南访员发表声明如下：“我认为美机故意破坏我国领空，系造成这样一种现象，即美国力量是如此的压倒优势，以致南国政府将被迫忍受一切事情。当整队飞机盘旋我国领空时，这是非常明显的事实。”铁托元帅于二十四日答复美联社记者时，亦斥责美国军用机有意侦察意在边界上的南国军事设备。铁托宣称：这种非法的在南国上空飞行，其目的之一为侦察我们驻军之防区和边界。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】纽约讯：全国争取和平大会主席宣布：退伍的海军陆战队上校卡尔逊三日向报界发表声明称：美国致南最后通牒事，乃系摹仿对付希腊巴勒斯坦与外约旦的手法。武力的威胁竟被用以支持在巴黎和华盛顿发表的尖刻的言词，这些言词不仅命令第二次世界大战的战败国，而且命令战胜国服从英美的和平。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据悉：南国已于二十三日向安理会提出美国非法扣留南国船只事，联合国经济社会理事会副主席南国代表斯佛美尔于二十三日致函秘书长莱氏，要求安理会下次会议的议程，应包括美国非法扣留南国船只问题。上述船只共达一百七十一艘，多系一般邮船，被美当局占领德国时扣留在德奥美国领区内。同日美官方人士声称：如果南斯拉夫同意美国在和会上所提国际共管多瑙河计划，美将释放这些船只。对这一声明，贝尔格莱德“格拉斯”报称之为政治阴谋与空前的威胁。
