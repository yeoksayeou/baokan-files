　　Wu'an After the Liquidation Movement
　　The Principle of "Land to the Tiller" is Initially Realized
　　Peasants Who Have Overturned Their Lives Buy Livestock in Succession to Prepare for Large-Scale Production
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] According to a report from Comrade Wang Tingdong of the Wu'an County Party Committee: After the large-scale inspection in Wu'an, 160,000 people in 243 villages in the new district launched a fierce and widespread liquidation movement in the first half of August. As a result of the movement, Sun Yat-sen's great ideal of "land to the tiller" has been initially realized. Of the 300,000 mu of land (approximately half of the total land) plundered by landlords in the past, approximately 50,000 mu were left to the landlords to maintain their livelihoods, while the remaining 250,000 mu (including the 200,000 mu cleared out last winter and this spring) have been returned to the peasants. In villages with a lot of land, such as Nan and Bei An'erzhuang, Shang and Xia Baishi, each person received five or six mu of land. In villages with less land, such as Dahezhuang, each person also received more than two and a half mu. In general villages, such as Boyan, Tonghui, and Shaozhuang, each person received three to four mu. Single men received especially more because everyone prepared for them to marry and start a family. Now the extremely poor stratum has been completely eliminated. The vast majority have become owner-farmers, while a few who are unwilling to farm use the money and goods recovered during the liquidation to engage in other production or run cooperatives.
    During this liquidation movement, the peasants' slogan was "Settle the general account with the landlords and thoroughly overturn our lives." Chengnan (South of the city) focused on settling accounts for labor and sweat (extra exploitation), while Chengbei (North of the city) focused on settling accounts for burdens to the enemy and puppets, and the liquidation was carried out universally. However, some cunning landlords pretended to be poor and desperately hid their property. Although the peasants repeatedly pleaded and reasoned, the landlords unreasonably delayed payment, which aroused the peasants' debt collection movement. Villages successively established committees for overturning lives and settling accounts, with 30,000 members of peasant associations (including female peasant association members) as the backbone, uniting all peasants to attack the feudal rulers. Before the action, more than a thousand cadres and activists conducted ideological self-examination, firming up their determination to eliminate feudalism, eliminate extreme poverty, and eliminate backwardness. Therefore, the broad masses of the backward stratum were drawn into the movement. Catholics in the Fourth District also participated in the movement, saying, "The Communist Party is the true savior, Catholicism is not!" Women poured into the ranks of debt collection, and children vigilantly guarded against stubborn elements who attempted to smuggle out supplies. Under the strong pressure of the peasants, many large landlords have taken out property to compensate the peasants. After receiving compensation, the peasants immediately used it to buy livestock (more than 20 households in the Xiwannian Village bought 22 head of livestock), establish cooperatives, and organize cotton ginning, oil pressing, dyeing workshops, and pharmacies. During the movement, some middle and small landlords voluntarily offered and returned accounts. The peasant associations adopted the attitude of "If you are enlightened, we will take care of you" towards those who were truly enlightened, and the method of "Grasp the fake enlightened to expose his true stubbornness" towards those who were falsely enlightened. With the consent of all middle peasants, struggles were also launched against individual traitors from the middle peasant class, and their lives were taken care of according to their degree of repentance. Chengguan (City gate area) launched a "de-hatting" movement for personnel of puppet organizations. Old servants and hired workers who had been oppressed in the homes of landlords and despots were also won over and joined the peasant ranks, helping to collect debts. Maids got rid of the abuse of the landlords' families and sought to marry peasants who had turned over a new leaf. Many poor dependents of martyrs, honored soldiers, and poor people in the old district also moved to the new district to settle down (more than 30 households were settled in Shangbaishi Village). The peasants excitedly said, "We have completely overturned our lives!" "We will never live in leaky houses, with broken pots, and sick wives again!" Now the county's militia has completed preparations for participating in the war, and some have already set off to support Anyang.
    The main problems of the current movement are:
    1. Rational distribution of fruits and realization of the "leveling" requirement. In the distribution of fruits, there are still deviations such as the masses being inferior to cadres, outsiders being inferior to villagers, the backward being inferior to the active, non-members being inferior to peasant association members, new members being inferior to old members, and individual accounting being inferior to collective struggle. Some villages also distribute according to the amount of work missed, or distribute equally regardless of poor and middle peasants. Some cadres even randomly draw, borrow, eat, drink, and waste the fruits of the struggle, which violates the interests of the masses. The broad masses demand leveling, "leveling" according to the degree of poverty, the amount of past gains, and current actual needs (distributing what is lacking), taking care of each other, democratic evaluation, and everyone comparing. This line is in line with the interests of the broad masses. Tonghui and Xiaohezhuang have created successful typical experiences. After the distribution of fruits in Tonghui Village, more than 40 poor, widowed, and orphaned households who could not work and produce established an old-age cooperative, with 900,000 shares already invested, and the peasant association allocated another 100,000 yuan as a subsidy fund, giving them long-term livelihood support. More than 20 widowed and orphaned households in the first street of Boyan have also collected 500,000 yuan in shares. This practice is being emulated in various villages. The Pingmin (common people's) Association in Chengguan put forward the slogan "The fruits of struggle are blood and sweat, don't sit and eat, don't sit and wear, use it as a capital for large-scale production," which has been responded to by the whole county.
    2. Overcome new complacency and carry out the movement of heroes of turning over a new leaf. Some cadres lost their specific direction in the heated movement and did not fully understand the complexity and arduousness of the movement. The Chengbei district prematurely shifted the focus of work to production, and the Chengnan district also wanted to take a breather. Reactionary landlords are plotting revenge. Yang Silou, a landlord in Tonghui, assassinated Shunyi's wife, an activist woman, and threw her into a well. Sun Caitang, a large landlord in Nanzhuang, fearing that hired workers would expose his darkness, threw the hired worker who had worked in his family for three generations into a well and killed him. In Shimen, Bate, Liuquan, Chegangkou and other villages, landlords and secret agents were found to have taken control of the militia, disbanded the peasant association, beat peasant association cadres, and plotted to riot. The county party committee has called for vigilance and a long-term struggle against feudal forces.
    In fact, there are still some backward masses in various villages who have not been sufficiently mobilized. Although they have been involved in the movement, they are not conscious enough. It is necessary to advocate that cadres should be honest and patient, and check and help the masses to turn over a new leaf without leaving a single household. Do not only look at emotions, but sit down and want numbers. The county party committee has called on cadres to welcome the autumn heroes conference, strive to be heroes of turning over a new leaf, and the Eighth District has discussed specific standards and plans to carry out the movement of supporting cadres, loving the people, turning over a new leaf, and uniting during the Mid-Autumn Festival.
    [Changzhi News] The people of the Third District of Wu'an, who have just turned over a new leaf, are now actively preparing for the large-scale production movement next year. In the movement of turning over a new leaf, they recovered more than 1,500 livestock from the exploiters. According to statistics from 40 villages (out of 42 villages in the whole district) in July, there were a total of 2,632 mules, donkeys, and cattle, almost 100% of which belonged to the peasants. In August, more than 300 head were added to the whole district. Xiwannian Village, with 110 households, bought 20 head in half a month. Nangang also bought six at a time, and other villages bought three, five, ten, or eight. A newly turned over household surnamed Zhang in Xiwannian said excitedly: "Now I have land and a village house, and if I buy another animal, I can produce well next year, and my life will be better."

　　武安经过清算运动
　　初步实现耕者有其田
　　翻身农民纷纷买牲口准备大生产
    【本报特讯】据武安县委王庭栋同志报导：武安自翻身大检查后，新区二百四十三村十六万群众，于八月上半月掀起猛烈而普遍的清算运动。运动结果，已使孙中山的伟大理想“耕者有其田”获得初步实现。过去为地主所掠夺的三十万亩土地（约占土地总数之半），除五万亩左右留给地主维持生活外，其余二十五万亩（包括去冬今春清算出来的二十万亩），均已复归农民所有。地多的如南、北安儿庄、上、下白石等村，每人均获得五、六亩土地。地少的如大贺庄等村，每人也获得二亩半以上。一般村庄如伯延、同会、邵庄等，每人均获得三至四亩。光棍汉分得特别多，因为大家准备叫他们娶妻成家，现在赤贫层已完全消灭。其中除绝大部分变为自耕农外，有少数不愿种地的，以清算中收回之钱物进行其他生产或办合作社。
    这次清算运动中，农民的口号是“和地主算总账，彻底翻身。”城南以算劳役血汗账（额外剥削）为主，城北以算对敌伪负担账为主，普遍展开清算。但有些狡猾的地主，一面装穷，一面拚命的隐藏财产；农民虽再三诉苦说理，地主却无理拖欠，于是激起农民的要账运动。各村纷纷成立翻身算账委员会，以三万农会会员（包括女农会会员）为骨干，团结全体农民，向封建统治者冲击。在行动前千余干部积极分子作了思想反省，坚定了消灭封建、消灭赤贫、消灭落后的决心。因此，广大的落后层都卷入运动。四区有天主教徒也参加了运动，他们说：“共产党才是真正的救世主，天主教不行！”妇女们都涌入要账的行列，儿童们认真地警戒着企图私运物资出走的顽固分子。在农民强大压力下，不少的大地主，已拿出财物偿还农民，农民获得赔偿后，当即用以买牲口（百余户的西万年村，已买牲口二十二头）、成立合作社、组织弹花、榨花、染坊、药房等。在运动中一些中小地主自动献出与清还账目，农会对真开明的，采取“你开明我照顾”的态度，对假开明的则采取“抓住假开明暴露他真顽固”的办法。个别中农成分的奸伪分子在全体中农同意下，也开展了斗争，并按他改悔程度照顾他的生活。城关开展了伪组织人员的“摘帽”运动。地主恶霸家里受压迫的老佣人、雇工等，也经过争取，纷纷投向农民阵营，帮助进行要账。使女们都摆脱地主家的虐待，找下翻身农民做结婚对象。老区不少贫苦抗属、荣誉军人、与贫民也搬到新区来安家（上白石一村安置三十余户）。农民兴奋的说：“翻身翻透啦！”“再不过漏房子、破锅、病老婆的时光啦！”现在全县民兵已完成参战准备，一部且已出发支援安阳。
    目前运动的主要问题是：
    一、合理分配果实，实现“填平”要求。在分配果实中还存在着群众不如干部，外来户不如本村户，落后的不如积极的，非会员不如农会员，新会员不如老会员，集体斗争不如个别算账的偏向。有的村还按误工多少来分，或不论贫中农平分。部分干部且乱抽乱借吃喝浪费斗争果实，这些都是违反群众利益的。广大群众要求填平，按贫苦程度、按过去得利多少、按现在实际需要（缺什么就分什么）来“填平”，互相照顾，民主评议，大家比较。这种路线是符合广大群众利益的。同会，小贺庄已创造了成功的典型经验。同会村在分配果实后，不能劳动生产的四十多家贫苦孤寡户，成立了养老合作社，已入股九十万，农会又拨出十万元作补助基金，使他们有了长期生活依靠。伯延一街二十多户孤寡也已集股五十万元。这种作法各村正在仿效。城关区平民会提出“斗争果实是血汗，不坐吃、不坐穿、作为生产大本钱”的口号已为全县所响应。
    二、克服新的满足情绪开展翻身英雄运动。有些干部在热烈的运动中迷失了具体方向，对运动的复杂性艰苦性认识不够，城北区过早的转变工作中心为生产，城南区也想松一口气。反动地主正在阴谋报复，同会地主杨四楼将妇女积极分子顺义妻暗杀投井，南庄大地主孙才唐，怕雇工暴露他的黑暗，竟将三辈子在他家作活的雇工投井处死，石门、八特、流泉、车纲口等村发现地主特务掌握民兵、解散农会、打农会干部、企图暴动的阴谋，县委已号召提高警惕，与封建势力作长期斗争。
    各村实际上都还有一部分发动不够的落后群众，他们虽卷入了运动，但自觉不够。必须提倡干部要老实耐心，一户不留的检查扶助群众翻身，不要只看情绪，坐要数字。县委已号召干部迎接秋后群英大会，争取翻身英雄，八区并已讨论出具体标准，拟于中秋节开展拥干爱民翻身团结运动。
    【长治讯】新翻身的武安三区人民，现正为来年的大生产运动作积极的准备。在翻身运动中，他们向剥削者要回了一千五百多个牲口，据七月份四十个村（全区共四十二村）统计，共有骡、驴、牛二千六百三十二头，这些牲口几乎百分之百属于农民。在八月份，全区又增加了三百多头，百十户的西万年村，半个月就买了二十头。南岗一次也买了六个，其它各村，三个、五个、十个、八个不等。西万年一个姓张的新翻身户很兴奋的说：“如今我有地也有庄子了，再买一个牲口，明年就可好好生产，生活就好了”。（史洪）
