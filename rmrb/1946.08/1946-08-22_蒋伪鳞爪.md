　　Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Regime's Claws and Scales
　　The Li Tongxiu camp of the New Fourth Route Army, on the first day, gave wheat to the Qingshuihe village headman, instructing him to grind it into flour. The next day, they demanded the flour, but the village headman said there was none. Two "soldiers" went straight into the village headman's inner room, frightening the young woman into hiding. The village headman, Li Xianghong, couldn't bear it and shouted, "You are truly unreasonable!" He got into a scuffle with them. In the afternoon, Li Xianghong's brother was arrested and only returned after paying 100,000 yuan. They also ordered two large landlords, Pan Yu'an and Pan Guozhang, to grind flour for them for free, but then falsely accused them of mixing white clay into the flour, extorting 30 shi of wheat from them.

　　Two soldiers from a certain company of the New Fourth Route Army stationed in Yanshougong Street, Jixian County, went to Jiaozhuang to demand firewood, scowling and shouting orders to the village heads, leaving them bewildered. A man named Li Yueqin in the village, filled with righteous indignation, scolded them: "You are a traitorous army and should be disbanded. What right do you have to act tough with the people!" The two soldiers immediately slapped him twice. He shouted angrily, "Hit them!" The masses rose up and beat the two soldiers. The next day, a platoon of soldiers went and arrested his grandfather, Li Lu, and took him to Daguanzhuang. The platoon leader defended the legality of his "official" traitorous status, saying, "Our being traitors is Chairman Chiang's order. How dare your family oppose it?" Old man Li took out the business card of his son, who was a division commander in the Central Army, but the platoon leader didn't acknowledge the connection. After mediation by the Daguanzhuang village headman, they settled the matter for 120,000 yuan.

　　The peaches are turning red, and the peach growers are very happy. But soldiers from the New Fourth Route Army stationed in Nantun, East Township, Jixian County, often sneak into the Luozhuang peach orchard at night to steal peaches. At midnight on July 5th, five or six soldiers quietly spread a woolen blanket under the tree. One by one, they climbed up the tree like monkeys and began to pluck the peaches. The old man watching the peaches, Yang Rongxuan, couldn't help but shout "Who's there?" The response was a few slaps in the face and the curse of being an old thing, and a threat to shoot him if he "barked" again! The woolen blanket was filled with peaches, and the monkeys left triumphantly. The old man cried inconsolably and became seriously ill from the anger.

　　Xu Wangniu, from Heshengtun, South Township, Jixian County, had promised her daughter to a company commander of the local New Fourth Route Army as his wife for 200,000 yuan. On the morning of July 20th, both sides kept their word, and the money and the person were exchanged. Unexpectedly, that night, the company commander sent four soldiers to Xu's house to demand the 200,000 yuan back. Xu Wangniu said, "I don't have it!" The soldiers pointed their guns at his chest and said, "Where's the 200,000 yuan that was delivered to you this morning? If you don't take it out, we'll shoot you!" Seeing the situation was bad, Xu Wangniu said, "That's right, it's still in the cabinet. Take it as you please!" Xu Wangniu ended up losing both her daughter and being frightened.
