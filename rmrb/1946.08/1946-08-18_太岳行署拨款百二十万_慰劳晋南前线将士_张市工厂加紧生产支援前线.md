　　[This newspaper Yangcheng News] Niu Peicong, Director of the Taiyue Administrative Office, and Pei Lisheng, Deputy Director, on behalf of the two million people in the entire region, sent a telegram to pay their respects to the Eighth Route Army for their meritorious service in the Jinan battle. They also allocated 1.2 million yuan, sending personnel to the front line to comfort the heroic soldiers.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 15th] Workers in various factories in Zhangjiakou, upon learning that Chiang's troops in eastern Hebei and Rehe had begun a large-scale offensive, were extremely indignant. They unanimously and spontaneously resolved to launch a production and frugality movement to support the front line. Wang Ruirong, a veteran worker and chairman of the trade union at the Zhangjiakou Leather Factory, took the lead in requesting to dedicate ten days of work, which was immediately met with enthusiastic response from workers in various workshops and studios in the factory. People flocked to the trade union to sign up. In less than five minutes, all the factory's employees had dedicated a total of 190 workdays, with wages totaling 342,000 border currency, which has been transferred to the Political Department of the Military Region to comfort the Eighth Route Army commanders and fighters on the front line. The Victory Match Company, through labor-management cooperation, had the factory provide raw materials and the workers process them in their spare time, rushing to produce 45,000 boxes of high-quality matches for the army. Many matchboxes also contained handwritten messages of comfort from the workers. A fifteen-year-old female worker wrote: "Thank you for your heroic fighting, which has protected the free and happy border area. We are a group of children in the production force, and in the future we will increase production to help you defeat the reactionaries." In addition, the Zhangjiakou Tobacco Company donated 50 boxes of cigarettes; the workers of the Desert Soap Company processed and manufactured more than 200 boxes of soap, which were sent to the front line. The total value of the above items reached more than 70 million yuan (equivalent to more than 14 million yuan in legal tender). The factories under the Xinghua Industrial Company Preparatory Office, the trade unions of the Military Region Logistics Department, the postal and electrical trade unions, etc., are currently forming comfort groups, which will depart for the front line soon.
