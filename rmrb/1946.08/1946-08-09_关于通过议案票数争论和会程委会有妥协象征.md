　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Paris - The debate within the Peace Conference's procedural committee regarding the number of votes required to pass resolutions is showing signs of compromise. During discussions, the British representative proposed an amendment to the original proposal from the Council of Foreign Ministers. This amendment stipulated that recommendations from the Peace Conference to the Council of Foreign Ministers concerning the drafting of peace treaties for the five nations should be divided into two categories: one category requiring a two-thirds majority vote for passage, and the other requiring a simple majority vote. The British amendment stated: "Both types of recommendations shall be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for consideration." Benes supported the British amendment, while the representatives of the Netherlands and Brazil insisted on the original proposal, demanding that all resolutions could be passed with a simple majority. The representatives of the two countries also appealed to Benes to support their demands. Molotov then proposed another amendment: arguing that if a recommendation cannot obtain a two-thirds majority, then the countries that support the recommendation can independently submit it to the Council of Foreign Ministers for consideration. The French representative generally agreed with Molotov's amendment.

　　关于通过议案票数争论和会程委会有妥协象征
    【新华社延安六日电】巴黎讯：和会程序委员会关于通过议案所需票数的争论，已有妥协的象征。在讨论中，英国代表提出对于外长会议原定建议的修正案。该修正案规定和会向外长会议提出关于拟制五国和约的建议应分为两类：一类是三分之二票数通过的，另一类是以过半数票通过的。英国修正案称：“两种建议都交由外长会议审议”。贝纳斯支持英国的修正案；荷兰与巴西代表则坚持原议，要求一切议案有过半数票赞成即可通过。两国代表并吁请贝纳斯支持他们的要求。莫洛托夫则提出另一修正案：主张建议案如不能获得三分之二的大多数票，则赞成该建议的国家可自行将该建议提交外长会议考虑之。法国代表大致同意莫氏之修正案。
