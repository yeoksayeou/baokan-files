Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 20th: After the Marshall-Stuart joint statement declared the mediation a failure, Chiang Kai-shek immediately issued a declaration of all-out civil war on the first anniversary of Japan's surrender. He deployed 85% of his total force of 253 divisions, or 204 divisions, into the civil war battlefield, intensifying the conflict.

	Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui) Battlefield: In addition to the original attacking forces, Chiang's army has successively增来 reinforced eight divisions since mid-July and is actively attacking along the north, south, and west three fronts. On the southern front: On the 2nd of this month, after Chiang's army occupied Haian Town at the cost of 3,000 casualties, it continued to attack east and northeast of Haian with seven divisions, occupying several villages and towns such as Libao and Zhongxiachang east of Haian, extending to the coastal area near 栟茶镇. After the Eighth Route Army launched a counterattack starting on the 10th, it wiped out the entire New 7th Brigade (formerly the New 7th Division) and most of the 105th Brigade (formerly the 105th Division), capturing the New 7th Brigade Deputy Commander Tian Yuncong and 5,000 officers and soldiers, including 105th Brigade Commander Jin Ya, and killing over 3,000. After suffering this blow, Chiang's army is reorganizing, preparing to attack again. On the northern front: Chiang's army, centered on Xuzhou, is advancing on the liberated areas in multiple directions, in accordance with Chiang's orders. One route north is coordinating with the 97th Army in 临城 to attack Zaozhuang. Western front: Although the Chiang army that occupied Sixian was wiped out团 outside Sixian, it is still plotting a fierce attack.

	Shandong Battlefield: The situation in southern Shandong is becoming increasingly fierce. After Chiang's army's 77th Army主力 occupied Hanzhuang, it is fiercely attacking Yixian in conjunction with aircraft, attempting to connect the 临城-Hanzhuang section with the 临城 garrison. Chiang's army's 37th Division, advancing east from Du'an (20余里 north of Jiawang), occupied the important town of Jiantou on the south bank of the canal and is now pressing towards Taierzhuang. Chiang's army's 8th Army主力, gathered on the Jiaoji Railway line, occupied the cities of Linzi and Guangrao and is planning to attack eastward along the Jiaoji Railway line (Guangrao city was retaken by us on the 13th).

	冀热 (Hebei-Rehe) Battlefield: In addition to the bulk of Chiang's army's 66th, 92nd, and 94th Armies, the 53rd Army, newly transferred from Guangdong, and a portion of the 62nd Army, transferred from as far away as Taiwan, have been增至 added to the Beining Railway area. Chiang's army, citing the 安平 Incident, is actively attacking Xianghe, Sanhe, and Baodi, intending to seize the above-mentioned areas as a preparatory deployment for attacking Chengde. After being阻击 blocked by the local Eighth Route Army, they are fighting across the Bei Canal. At the same time, Chiang's army's 13th Army on the 锦(州)平(泉) Road occupied Tianyi Station and other places and made probing attacks along the 叶(柏寿)-赤(峰) line. After being hit by the Eighth Route Army, they have retreated to Tianyi Station.

	晋南 (Southern Shanxi) Battlefield: Chiang Kai-shek has recently transferred troops from Henan and Shaanxi to cross the river to the front lines. Chiang's army's eight divisions are deployed and are attacking Houma from Wenxi, having already occupied Dongzhen.

	In豫陕鄂 (Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei): The Chiang army besieging Li Xiannian's troops continues to intensify its encirclement and interception, disregarding the three-week ceasefire agreement by the Executive Headquarters. Chiang Kai-shek is simultaneously transferring troops from the forces encircling and殲滅 wiping out Li Xiannian's troops to reinforce the陇海 (Longhai Railway) front line. He is also transferring Hu Zongnan's troops and the original 14th Army stationed in Chongqing to encircle and attack the Central Plains troops.

Since the middle of last month, Chiang's army has successively invaded and occupied eleven county towns and hundreds of villages and towns in the liberated areas, including Xiaoxian, Lingbi, Rugao, Tianchang, Sixian, Wuhe, and Haian in Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui), and Jiyang, Yidu, Linzi, and Guangrao on the Jiaoji Railway line (Jiyang and Guangrao have been restored by us).

Due to Chiang Kai-shek's insatiable greed, after invading and occupying many places in Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui), the central Shanxi plains, and several cities on the Jiaoji Railway line, he continues to attack, the military and civilians in the liberated areas have launched a righteous self-defense counterattack, inflicting great losses on the attacking Chiang army. In the陇海 (Longhai Railway), southern Tongpu section, and Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui) lines alone, 30,000 Chiang troops have been歼灭 annihilated, captured, or spontaneously laid down their weapons in the past ten days, and seven liberated county towns. If calculated since mid-July, Chiang's army has suffered a total of 130,000 casualties, accounting for one-fifteenth of its total strength. The Eighth Route Army on the陇海 (Longhai Railway) launched a counterattack starting on the evening of the 10th, successively liberating the five county towns of Dangshan, Lanfeng, Yucheng, Qixian, and Tongxu on the陇海 (Longhai Railway) and on both sides of it, as well as more than ten important towns such as Huangkou, Yejigang railway stations, and Zhuxian Town. More than 15,000 Chiang troops (including a part of Chen Cheng's嫡系 direct line部队 units with American equipment) were歼 annihilated and laid down their weapons. The central section of the陇海 (Longhai Railway) between 60里 west of Xuzhou and 20里 west of Lanfeng, a distance of more than 300里, is completely controlled by the Eighth Route Army. This battle delivered a punch to the vital points of Chiang Kai-shek's offensive system, causing Chiang Kai-shek to panic and transfer troops from other battlefields to reinforce the陇海 (Longhai Railway) front line. This greatly assisted the self-defense of the Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui) military and civilians and effectively weakened Chiang's army's encirclement of Li Xiannian's troops. The Eighth Route Army in the central Tongpu section also coordinated with the militia to implement self-defense counterattacks, successively liberating the famous cotton and wheat producing area in southern Shanxi and the two county towns of Hongdong and Zhaocheng on the Tongpu Railway from the hands of the puppet army. By this time, the 110里 section of the Tongpu Railway from the bottom of Tan in Huoxian to Zhangbao north of Linfen is entirely controlled by the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army on the Zhengtai Railway also coordinated its attack in the middle of this month, liberating Chengjialongdi southwest of Niangziguan and Panshi West Station east of Yangquan from the hands of the Yan puppet army.

The people's militia and guerrillas in the entire liberated area are making every effort to defend themselves. After our army on the陇海 (Longhai Railway) launched a counterattack, the local militia actively cooperated in the battle, liberating Zhuxian Town on the 13th, and once raided the southern gate and airport of Kaifeng at night, shocking the Chiang army in Kaifeng. The militia and guerrilla warfare movement in various parts of Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui) has been widely launched. The three main Chiang army transportation routes of 苏中南 (Nantong)如 (Rugao), 如 (Rugao)泰 (Taixing), and 黄 (Qiao)靖 (Jiang) have all been destroyed by the militia. The Jingjiang column and the militia intercepted the invading Chiang army 20里 north of Jingjiang City, killing and capturing more than 200 people and seizing 17 ships. There are 10,000 militiamen in Xin County cooperating with the regular army in combat. In the Linfen-Quwo area of the Taiyue Second Military Sub-district, 5,000 militiamen automatically organized rotation teams to conduct independent guerrilla warfare on the 250里 battle line from Xiaxian to Hongdong. Conversely, the anti-war and厌战 war-weariness of officers and soldiers driven by Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war is increasing daily. In the past ten days, there have been many anti-civil war uprisings by Chiang's army. Jiang Jiabin, the commander-in-chief of the joint command of Xiayi, Yucheng, and Yongcheng on the陇海 (Longhai Railway) front line, led 5,000 troops in an uprising in Yucheng, sided with the people, and cooperated with the Eighth Route Army in combat. The first battalion of the 15th Traffic Police Corps of the Dai Li system in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, with 400 people, revolted against the civil war under the leadership of Battalion Commander Wang Yifang. Desertion and escape due to 厌战 war-weariness by Chiang's army soldiers are also occurring everywhere.

　　七月中旬大举进犯解放区以来
　　蒋军损兵折将达十三万
　　解放区军民自卫作战情绪极高蒋军师出无名厌战起义者日增
    【新华社延安二十日电】马、司联合声明宣告调停失败，蒋介石紧接着于日本投降一周年发表宣布全面内战文告，采取总兵力二五三个师的百分之八十五，即二○四个师投入内战战场，战火愈演愈大。
    苏皖战场：蒋军除原有进攻部队外，自七月中旬，又先后增来八个师，正积极向南北西三线出犯。在南线：本月二日，蒋军以三千人之损失侵占海安镇后，继以七个师之兵力，向海安东及东北进攻，侵占海安东之李堡、中下场等村镇数处，伸至栟茶镇近海一带。经八路军于十日起反击，歼灭其新七旅全部（原为新七师）及一○五旅（原一○五师）大部，新七旅副旅长田云从一○五旅长金亚以下五千官兵被俘，三千余人被击毙。蒋军遭此打击后，正重新整顿，准备再犯。在北线：蒋军以徐州为中心，遵照蒋之手令，分路向解放区进攻。其北进一路，正配合临城九十七军进攻枣庄。西线：攻占泗县之蒋军，虽在泗县外围被我歼灭一团，但仍阴谋猛犯。
    山东战场：鲁南战况日趋激烈，蒋军七十七军主力于侵占韩庄后，正以飞机联合猛犯峄县，并图与临城驻军打通临城韩庄段。由杜安（贾汪北二十余里）东犯之蒋军三十七师，于侵占运河南岸重镇涧头后，正向台儿庄进逼。集结于胶济线之蒋军第八军主力，于侵占临淄、广饶两城后，正图沿胶济线向东进攻（现广饶城已于十三日为我克复）。
    冀热战场：蒋军六十六、九十二、九十四三个军之大部外，新由广东调来五十三军，及远从台湾调来之六十二军一部，增至北宁路一带。蒋军借口安平事件，正积极向香河、三河、宝坻进攻，图夺取上述各地，以为进攻承德之准备部署。经当地八路军阻击，正在北运河对战中。同时锦（州）平（泉）路蒋军十三军侵占天义车站等地，并沿叶（柏寿）赤（峰）线作试探性进攻，在遭受八路军打击后，已退守天义车站。
    晋南战场：蒋介石近从豫、陕各地抽调军队渡河开赴前线，该地蒋军八个师部署就绪，正由闻喜向侯马进攻，已侵占东镇。
    在豫陕鄂：围攻李先念部之蒋军，不顾执行部中原停战三周的协议，仍继续加紧包围和截击；蒋介石一面从围歼李先念之部队中抽调一部增援陇海前线，一面又将胡宗南部队及原驻重庆之十四军增调包围进攻中原部队。
    自上月中旬以来，蒋军已先后侵占解放区十一座县城及大小村镇数百处，其中包括苏皖之萧县、灵壁、如皋、天长、泗县、五河、海安及胶济线之济阳、益都、临淄、广饶（济阳、广饶为我光复）。
    解放区军民由于蒋介石贪得无餍在侵占苏皖许多地方、晋中平川与胶济线数城市后，仍继续进攻不已，乃举行正义的自卫反击，使进攻之蒋军遭到极大损失。仅陇海、同蒲南段及苏皖各线，十日来即有三万蒋军被歼灭俘获或自动放下武器，解放县城七座。如以七月中旬以来计，则蒋军共损耗十三万人，占其总兵力十五分之一。陇海八路军自十日晚起举行反攻，先后解放陇海线上及其两侧之砀山、兰封、虞城、杞县、通许五座县城，及黄口、野鸡岗等车站与朱仙镇等重镇十余处。蒋军被歼与放下武器者共一万五千余人（包括一部分美械化之陈诚嫡系部队）。徐州以西六十里至兰封西廿里间三百余里之陇海中段完全为八路军所控制。这一战役对蒋介石进攻体系的要害上还击了一拳，使蒋介石手忙脚乱，从其他战场上抽调兵力增援陇海路前线。这样既大大帮助了苏皖军民的自卫、又有效的削弱了蒋军对于李先念部的围攻。同蒲中段八路军亦配合民兵实行自卫反击，先后从伪军手中解放晋南著名棉麦产区，同蒲路上之洪洞、赵城两县城。至此，霍县坛底以南至临汾张堡以北一百一十里之同蒲线全为八路军所控制。正太线八路军亦于本月中旬配合出击，从阎伪军手中解放娘子关西南之程家陇底及阳泉以东之盘石西车站。
    全解放区的人民民兵和游击队正以全力进行自卫，陇海线我军实行反攻后，当地民兵即积极配合作战，于十三日解放朱仙镇，并曾一度夜袭开封南关及机场，开封城内蒋军为之震惊。苏皖各地民兵与游击队参战运动已普遍开展，苏中南（通）如（皋）、如（皋）泰（兴）、黄（桥）靖（江）三条蒋军主要交通公路线均被民兵破坏，靖江纵队与民兵曾在靖江城北二十里处截击出犯之蒋军，毙俘二百余，缴获船只十七艘。忻县有一万民兵配合正规军作战，太岳二分区临汾曲沃等九县有五千民兵自动组织轮战队，在夏县至洪洞二五○里战线上独立进行游击战。相反，为蒋介石驱作内战之官兵厌战与反战情绪日增。过去十日内曾有蒋军反内战起义多起，陇海前线夏邑、虞城、永城联合指挥部总指挥蒋嘉宾氏于虞城率部五千起义，站到人民方面与八路军配合作战。胶济路东段戴笠系之交通警察第十五总队第一大队，有四百人在大队长王一芳领导下反内战起义。蒋军士兵之厌战逃跑者亦到处发生。
