Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 21st: The Northeast Provinces Representative Joint Conference recently sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Mao Zedong in Yan'an, Mr. Zhang Lan of the Democratic League, various political parties, democratic personages, and compatriots across the country, demanding that the Chiang government immediately release Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng. The telegram initially stated that Generals Zhang and Yang have been imprisoned for ten years, pointing out that this is an action "without any legal basis, only relying on personal likes and dislikes to trample on patriotic people and trample on human rights," which has aroused sighs from Chinese and foreign people and indignation from the elders of the Northeast. The telegram strongly stated: "In order to enhance national integrity and win over people's hearts, it is hoped that the Double Tenth Agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference will be implemented immediately, and Generals Zhang and Yang and other political prisoners will be released immediately!"

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 22nd: News from Nanjing: Mr. Feng Yuxiang retired at the end of last month and will go to South America early next month to inspect water conservancy. Mrs. Feng Li Dequan, one daughter, one private secretary, and writer Wu Zuxiang will accompany him. Mr. Feng is rushing to write the sequel to his autobiography before his departure. The first volume of the autobiography is titled "My Life," and the English translation will be published soon.
