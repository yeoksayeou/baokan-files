Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese General Federation of Labor officially expanded into a nationwide organization on the 1st, with a total membership of 855,000. This federation was originally a trade union organization formed by the Japanese Socialist Party. Its chairman is Komakichi Matsuoka, a right-wing leader of the Socialist Party, who in the past had vehemently opposed the Japanese Communist Party's proposal for a united workers' front. Later, left-wing leaders of the Socialist Party such as Kanji Kato joined the leadership of the federation, causing Matsuoka to become increasingly isolated and accept the JCP's proposal. (This federation is a united front organization of Japanese workers, and with the support of the JCP, it has developed rapidly, with membership nearly doubling since June, making it the largest workers' organization in Japan).

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Tokyo dispatch: The Kanto area (i.e., the Tokyo-Yokohama area) trade union federation members have scheduled a demonstration for tomorrow (the 5th) to protest the anti-strike bill submitted to the Diet by the reactionary Yoshida government. National railway employees across the country will also participate at that time.

　　日共职工统战主张实现
    劳动总同盟扩大
    会员总数已达八十万余人
    【新华社延安三日电】东京讯：日本劳动总同盟于一日正式扩大为全国性组织，会员总数达八十五万五千人，该同盟原为日本社会党所组织的职工团体。主席为社会党右翼领袖松冈驹吉，过去曾竭力反对日共的职工统一战线的主张，后来社会党左翼领袖加藤勘士等参加该盟的领导，使松冈日趋孤立，并接受日共建议（该同盟为日本职工的统一战线组织，今在日共支持下发展迅速，会员几较六月间增加两倍，已成为日本最大的职工组织）。
    【新华社延安四日电】东京讯：关东区（即东京横滨一带）各工会联盟会员，定明（五）日游行示威，以抗议吉田反动政府提交议会的反罢工法案。届时全国国营铁路员工亦将参加。
