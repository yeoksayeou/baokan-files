Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: Moscow today broadcast: Commentator Masinu commented: In the year since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, China's civil war has developed to an unprecedented scale, the war in Indonesia has intensified, and the civil war in the Philippines has also been increasing. The reason for all this is, as Marshal Tito said at the Metallurgical Workers' Congress on August 19: "In this great war, some countries that fought alongside us are unwilling for us to obtain a just peace, but want us to accept an imperialist peace." It was emphasized during the war that the last remnants of fascism and militarism must be eliminated, but in the past year, the policy implemented in Japan has been a policy of reviving Japanese reactionary forces. Under MacArthur's instigation, Japanese democratic forces have been destroyed. If this continues, in ten or twenty years, aggressive forces will undoubtedly raise their heads and become a threat to universal peace. However, consolidating peace in the Far East depends not only on the control of Japan, but also on giving freedom and independence to colonial countries and carrying out democratic reforms. The oppression of colonial independence movements is creating favorable conditions for the revival of Japanese aggressive forces. All the promises made by the Allies during the war regarding allowing colonies to achieve national liberation and democratization have not been fulfilled. In Indonesia, British and Dutch troops, with the help of the Japanese army, destroyed all people's organizations; in the Philippines, the United States is carrying out armed intervention, helping reactionaries and traitors against patriotic people. American artillery is bombarding the Filipino people. The United States is also adopting the methods used in the Philippines in China, carrying out armed intervention. A British magazine reporter said: If democracy triumphs in China, then democratic forces will also triumph in Annam, Siam, Malaya, India, and even in Japan. This shows that it is natural for fascism and imperialism to try to hinder this development. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the struggle of people of all countries for national independence, peace and democracy has just begun. Therefore, the Potsdam Declaration on the elimination of Japanese imperialism and the Moscow Conference resolution on the China issue are of particularly important significance. The Moscow Conference resolution on China stipulates the establishment of a coalition government, cessation of civil war, implementation of democratic reforms, and a tripartite agreement not to interfere in China's internal affairs. The Soviet Union has been and is faithful to this resolution. Undoubtedly, other countries, especially the United States, have not yet implemented this resolution. The withdrawal of US troops from China will promote the establishment of peace in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: TASS, New York: Editor Baddovi of the afternoon newspaper criticized the foreign policy of the United States in an editorial he wrote. Baddovi wrote: China is one of the regions that must be adjusted. Our China policy has made a huge mistake. Our representatives in China, General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, have admitted their failure. In order to support a corrupt and autocratic regime in China that cannot gain national support and cannot maintain order, we are transporting troops, money, and supplies to China. But all this is a waste of effort. Not only do many Chinese wish Americans to leave China, but even our own sailors, miners, and railroad employees are also tired of the domestic political situation in China and wonder what is keeping them in China. The failure of our China policy shows that our unchanging anti-Soviet policy in some regions is completely impractical. We must remember that the border between the Soviet Union and China stretches for thousands of miles, so the Soviet Union naturally pays attention to the events that occur on the other side of this border, just as we pay attention to Canada. We support Chiang Kai-shek because we want to turn China into an anti-Soviet base for the United States. Baddovi criticized the guiding principles of American foreign policy, saying: "Our recent note to Poland and the Soviet Union, coupled with our interference in China and the continued creation of chaos there, have clearly demonstrated the nature of our foreign policy. This policy can be judged in the current situation and is clearly based on the following guiding principles: on all issues, in all important regions, adopt a tough policy towards the Soviet Union. The tripartite unity that Roosevelt strived to achieve for long-term cooperation is being split. In order to achieve international stability, we must re-examine our current 'should be tougher' policy and the 'toughness' of what we call policy."

　　马西努批评美国外交政策
    纵容反动派威胁和平
    应依莫斯科决议撤退驻华美军
    【新华社延安廿七日电】莫斯科今日广播：评论员马西努评论：日寇投降以来的一年中，中国的内战已发展到空前未有的规模，印尼的战争在激烈化，菲律宾内战也日益加强起来。这一切的原因，正如八月十九日铁托元帅在冶金工人大会上所说的：“在此次大战中，有些与我们并肩作战的国家不愿意我们获得正义和平，而要我们接受帝国主义和平。”还在战时就已着重指出，必须消灭法西斯主义与军国主义的最后残余，但最近一年来，在日本实行的政策，是使日本反动势力复活的政策。在麦克阿瑟怂恿之下，日本民主力量已受到摧残，假使这样继续下去，经过十年二十年，无疑地侵略势力会抬起头来，成为普遍和平的威胁。但是，巩固远东和平不仅依赖对日的管制，而且依赖给予各殖民地国家以自由独立，并进行民主改革。对殖民地独立运动的压迫，正是替日本侵略势力的复活造成良好的条件。战时盟国关于准许殖民地获得民族解放与民主化的一切诺言都未实现。在印尼，英荷军在日军帮助下，摧毁一切人民的组织；在菲律宾，美国正实行武装干涉，帮助反动派与叛徒反对爱国志士。美国的大炮轰击菲律宾人民，美国在中国也是采用在菲岛的方法，实行武装干涉。英国一杂志记者说：假使民主在中国胜利，那末民主势力在安南、暹逻、马来亚、印度，甚至在日本也会取得胜利。这就说明法西斯主义与帝国主义企图妨碍此种发展是很自然的。日寇投降后，各国人民争取民族独立与和平民主的斗争才刚刚开始，因此波茨顿会议关于消灭日本帝国主义的宣言，莫斯科会议关于中国问题的决议，是有特别重要的意义。莫斯科会议关于中国的决议，规定建立联合政府，停止内战，实行民主改革，及三国相约不干涉中国内政。苏联在过去与现在，都是忠实于这个决议，无疑其他国家、首先是美国还未执行这一决议，美军从中国撤退，将会促进建立远东和平。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】塔斯社纽约讯：下午报编辑巴多维在其所撰社论中，批评美国的对外政策。巴氏写道：中国是必须调整的地区之一，我们的对华政策犯了绝大的错误，我们的驻华代表马歇尔将军与司徒雷登大使，已承认他们的失败。为了支持中国一个不能得到全国拥护、不能维持秩序的腐败专制的政权，我们正把军队、金钱与供应品运往中国。但是这一切都是白费气力，不仅许多中国人愿望美国人离开中国，而且甚至我们自己的水兵、矿工与铁路员工对于中国国内政治局势也表示厌烦，并且诧异什么事情使他们留在中国？我们对华政策的失败，表明我们在某些区域不变的反苏政策是毫不实际的。我们必须记得，苏联与中国的边界绵延数千里，因此苏联很自然地注意这一边界彼方所发生的事变，亦如我们注意加拿大的同样现象那样。我们支持蒋介石，是因为我们想把中国变为美国的反苏基地。巴氏批评美国对外政策的领导原则说：“我们最近致波兰及苏联的通牒，加上我们干涉中国及在那儿继续造成混乱状态，已清楚表明了我们对外政策的性质，这一政策在目前情况下可加以判断，很明显的是基于下述指导原则：在一切问题上，在一切重要地区，对苏联采取强硬政策，罗斯福力谋取得长期合作的三强团结，正在被分裂。为了达到国际稳定，我们必须重新审查我们现在“应该更强硬的”政策及我们所称为政策的“强硬”。
