According to a Taiwan dispatch in Tianjin's Yi Shi Bao: The folk song "Five Days, Five Places" is a very apt description of the political situation in Taiwan. Before the Japanese surrendered, American planes heavily bombed Taiwan, which was "shocking the heavens and shaking the earth." When Japan surrendered, the Taiwanese people welcomed the Kuomintang's receiving officials with "joyful delight." And the receiving officials responded to the people's welcome by filling their pockets, so the teahouses, restaurants, and brothels became lively, "indulging in pleasure." Immediately following this was the decline of all industries and soaring prices, "people living in misery," a "dark and chaotic world." As a result, the Taiwanese people were completely disappointed, and anger and resentment grew in their hearts, reaching the final stage: "blaming heaven and earth."

In the past, the Taiwanese people called Japanese imperialism dogs; now, they call the Kuomintang officials pigs, or "pig liver" (in Taiwanese, "pig official"). Recently, when Taiwanese people go to the market to buy vegetables, some call out "buying Chen Yi's stagnant money," meaning they want to buy a yuan's worth of pig liver. Now, Kuomintang government officials in Taiwan dare not show their faces in public as they did when they first arrived, nor do they dare to wear uniforms, otherwise, they risk being beaten by the people. Someone used a dog and a pig to darkly compare the Kuomintang and Japan, saying: "Dogs can guard the door, pigs only know how to eat. The dogs left, and the pigs came; what use are pigs?" With the public sentiment like this, some officials who have already amassed fortunes feel that their time is running out, and "of the thirty-six stratagems, running away is the best," and they are leaving Taiwan one after another.

　　五天五地
    据天津益世报载台湾通讯称：民谣中的“五天五地”是台湾政治情形的很恰当描写。日寇投降前，美国飞机大炸台湾，这是“惊天动地”。日本投降了，台湾老百姓迎接国民党的接收大员“欢天喜地”。而接收大员回答老百姓的欢迎，钱袋装得饱饱的，于是茶楼、酒馆、妓院就热闹起来了，“花天酒地”。紧接着就是百业萧条，物价飞涨，“民不聊生”，“昏天黑地”，结果台湾老百姓完全失望了，在他们的心中滋长着愤怒和怨恨，这就到了最末一个时期：“怨天怨地”。
    台湾人过去把日本帝国主义称为狗，现在他们把国民党官僚称为猪，或“猪肝”（台湾人读“猪官”）。近来台湾人上市买菜，有呼“买陈仪闭塞钱”者，其意即欲买猪肝一元。现在在台湾的国民党政府官员，已不敢如初来时那样抛头露面出门，也不敢穿着制服，否则便有被老百姓痛打一顿的危险。有人用一只狗，一条猪来暗比国民党和日本道：“狗可守门、猪一味吃，狗走猪来，要猪何用”？民情如此，有些已经腰缠万贯的官员，亦感之日将届，“三十六计，走为上计”，纷纷离台他去。
