Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 30th: Chiang Kai-shek has deployed 71 of his 91 army corps (78% of his total military force) to the front lines of the civil war. The civil war has expanded from the Central Plains to Jiangsu, Anhui, and the entirety of North China. Additionally, Chiang's troops in the Northeast are poised to take action. The Chinese civil war has begun to take on a national scale. In July alone, Chiang's troops successively occupied 14 county towns and over 300 villages in the liberated areas. These 14 county towns are Rugao, Tianchang, Xiaoxian, Lingbi, and Sixian in Jiangsu and Anhui; Wenxi in Shanxi; and Jimo, Jiaoxian, Yidu, Zichuan, Boshan, Zhangqiu, Zouping, and Jiyang in Shandong. Who is attacking whom is plainly evident. However, in the one month of offensives, Chiang Kai-shek has paid the price of 53,000 casualties, at least one-fiftieth of his total army strength. It is generally accepted that towns and cities can change hands, but the massive attrition of manpower, the most crucial factor in war, is a loss that is difficult to replenish. The more Chiang Kai-shek expands his offensives against the liberated areas, the more his forces will be stretched thin. Under the strong counter-attacks of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, Chiang's troops will continue to lose more of their manpower, and their morale will inevitably decline. The forces defending Chiang's rear in fifteen provinces have been reduced to twenty corps a month ago, and recently, three more corps have been drawn into the civil war. Insufficient troop strength and low morale will be an insurmountable difficulty for Chiang Kai-shek in the military aspect. The war situation of the past ten days is summarized by region as follows:

	(1) Jiangsu and Anhui Front: Chiang's troops besieging the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated areas total 500,000, of which 250,000 have launched offensives from the south, west, and north. The fighting began on the southern front, launched under the command of Tang Enbo, extending over a hundred miles from Laian to Nantong along the Yangtze River and deep into the liberated areas. Chiang's troops suffered a devastating blow from the New Fourth Army in the Rugao and Taixing areas, losing over 20,000 men. He urgently transferred the 65th and 3rd Corps from Hangzhou and other places as reinforcements. Tianchang, Rugao, and Jiangyan town east of Taizhou have been captured, and offensives continue in an attempt to seize Xuyi, Shaobo, Qutang, and Haian. Chiang's troops, deployed along the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, from Xuzhou to Bengbu over a 500-li stretch, are launching offensives east and west of the railway, extending 50 to 100 li in each direction. The main force of the offensive against Huaibei east of the railway, consisting of the 7th, 48th, and 58th Corps, captured Lingbi City on the 22nd and continued their attacks, occupying Sixian City, the seat of the Seventh Administrative Region of Jiangsu and Anhui, on the 28th. Chiang's troops, attacking Huaibei west of the railway, captured Xiaoxian again on the 18th and Suixikou on the 19th, with one target being Yongcheng in the easternmost part of Henan Province. Chiang's troops, advancing southeast from Xuzhou along the coastal highway, after capturing Shuanggou and Chulan on the Ban Gu line, are attempting to invade Suining City. Simultaneously with the land offensive, Chiang's troops have seven U.S.-supplied warships and over 50 aircraft from the Sixth Air Force Group cooperating in the operation. In this offensive operation, Chiang Kai-shek has staked all the troops from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. Kuomintang propaganda organs have clamored about the "Communist threat to Nanjing and Shanghai" and even fabricated rumors of attempted riots, but the 74th Corps, which attacked Tianchang, was originally the guard force of Nanjing under Tang Enbo, and the 11th Corps, stationed in Chongming and Kunshan, was originally responsible for the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) line's defense but has now been used as a mobile corps to attack central Jiangsu. Even so, Chiang's front-line commanders still feel that this battle is not very promising, especially since the main force of the 49th Corps was annihilated in the Rugao area, which has greatly affected the morale of Chiang's troops.

	(2) Central Plains Front: After the breakout of the Central Plains Communist troops, one unit personally led by Li Xiannian west of the Pinghan Railway has crossed the Dan River and entered the Shangnan and Shanyang areas of southern Shaanxi. Chiang Kai-shek dispatched six divisions to pursue them for thousands of miles and transferred four divisions of Hu Zongnan's troops to block them in Jingziguan and Mancheng Pass. On the 17th, he telegraphed all armies three times, ordering them to encircle and annihilate Li's unit south of Jingziguan, making the fighting exceptionally fierce. From the 19th to the 21st, Chiang's troops formed five encirclements, but Li Xiannian's unit broke through them one by one, successfully breaking out of the encirclement. Ironically, Chiang Kai-shek offered a reward of three million to capture Li Xiannian, while simultaneously requesting Commander Li to attend a meeting in Longjuzhai to discuss mediation. Another unit led by Wang Shusheng, breaking out to the west, has advanced to the Wudang Mountain area on the border of Hubei, Henan, and Shaanxi. Chiang's troops are pursuing with three divisions and transferring Sichuan troops from northeastern Sichuan to block them. In a battle north of Baokang on the 22nd, over 400 enemy soldiers were annihilated. As for the units breaking out to the east, one unit has entered a safe zone, while two other units are engaged in counter-"encirclement and suppression" operations with Chiang's troops in the Guangshan and Xuanhuaidian areas of eastern Henan and the Taihu and Qianshan areas of western Anhui. It is reported that Chiang's troops are transferring two divisions of the Fourth Corps under Wu Qisheng from Jiangxi to reinforce the north, and a fierce battle is expected. In this pursuit and blockade of the Central Plains breakout troops, Chiang's troops are in a state of confusion. Not only do middle and lower-ranking officers and soldiers feel weary, but a certain high-ranking officer also believes that the failure to "encircle and annihilate" the Central Plains troops is a major failure. However, Chiang Kai-shek is still punishing "ineffective" subordinates and strictly ordering them to continue the pursuit and blockade.

	(3) Shanxi Front: In the Fen River Delta of southern Shanxi, since the reinforcement of Hu Zongnan's First and Twenty-seventh Corps, the fighting has intensified again, with fierce battles unfolding simultaneously along the Tongpu Railway. After capturing the Zhang (dian)-Mao (jin) Highway, they also captured Wenxi City. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, successively annihilating five regiments of Chiang-Yan troops in the area west of Wenxi. Currently, the Chiang-Yan troops are continuing their offensive, attempting to clear the railway line between Wenxi and Linfen to the north. Qinxian City, the midpoint of the second railway in southern Shanxi, the Baijin Line, is a small knife inserted into the southeastern Shanxi liberated area by Duan Bingchang's puppet troops incorporated by Yan Xishan. Local people, with the support of the Eighth Route Army, disarmed the puppet troops on the evening of the 21st and liberated Qinxian City and several puppet military strongholds to the north. Currently, the entire Baijin Line south of Nanguan is controlled by the Eighth Route Army, and the Qinxian and Wuxiang areas have been liberated. In central Shanxi, after Yan Xishan, in conjunction with Japanese and puppet troops, invaded large areas of plains in Fenyang, Wenshui, and Jiaocheng, they continued their offensive towards the Lüliang Mountains. At the same time, Yan Xishan's troops in Datong also ventured south and east along the Tongpu and PingSui Railways in response. The JinSui and JiJin Eighth Route Armies took defensive actions, successively disarming Yan's and puppet troops in Shuoxian, Ningwu, Shanyin, Fanshi, Daixian, Guoxian, Wutai, Dingxiang, Yuanping, and Xinkou. By this point, there were no traces of puppet troops on the 500-li section of the northern Tongpu Railway, and the Wutai and Lüliang Mountains were connected as one.

	(4) Shandong Front: The Shandong war is continuing along the Jiaoji Railway. Chiang Kai-shek has concentrated five corps, with Jinan, Weixian, and Qingdao as bases, supporting each other and launching fierce attacks in separate directions. After invading Zouping, Zhangqiu, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Zichuan, Boshan, and Jiaoxian, they reoccupied Yidu on the 23rd and will attack Gaomi City and other stations still defended by the New Fourth Army, in an attempt to clear the entire Jiaoji line. At the same time, a fierce battle is also unfolding for Jiyang City northeast of Jinan. After 36 hours of bloody fighting, the Bohai Eighth Route Army recovered the city on the 18th, annihilating over a thousand of Chiang's troops, but the city was again invaded by attacking troops.

	In addition, the 53rd Corps of Chiang's troops newly arrived in Qinhuangdao is deploying along the Beining Railway, plotting to join the nine corps already in the Jidong and Redong areas to attack the JiReLiao area along the Jincheng, Pinggu, and Beining Railways in order to cut off the defensive links between the Northeast and North China liberated areas.

	In the Northeast, Chiang's troops are using mediation as a cover to consolidate the areas they have already invaded, arresting large numbers of young men to replenish their casualties. They are also preparing to attack Andong from the central, southern, and northern fronts at any time.

　　蒋军倾全力进犯解放区
    内战渐具全国性规模
    一个月战斗蒋军损失五万余
    【新华社延安三十日电】蒋介石已将其全国陆军九十一个军中的七十一个军（即百分之七十八的兵力）加入内战前线，内战已由中原扩大到苏皖以及整个华北，而东北蒋军亦正待机行动，中国内战已开始具有全国规模性质。七月份一个月中，蒋军连续侵占了解放区十四座县城与三百余个村镇。此十四座县城即苏皖的如皋、天长、萧县、灵壁、泗县，山西的闻喜与山东的即墨、胶县、益都、淄川、博山、章邱、邹平、济阳，谁进攻谁，已昭然若揭。但蒋介石在进攻的一月中，已付出了五万三千人的代价，至少占其陆军兵力的五十分之一。一般认为城镇可以互易其手，而决定战争的最主要因素——有生力量的庞大消耗，却是难能补充的损失。蒋介石对解放区的进攻愈扩大，他的兵力也就愈分散，在解放区军民的坚强反击下，蒋军将继续耗损它的更多有生力量，士气亦必然日益低落。月前防守蒋军后方十五个省份的兵力已减至二十个军，最近又抽出三个军投入内战，兵力不敷，士气低落，这将是军事方面蒋介石所遇到的一个不可克服的困难。兹将十日战况按地区分别综合报导如下：
    （１）苏皖方面：蒋军包围苏皖解放区的兵力，共达五十万之众，其已由南、西、北三面出动进攻者，即有二十五万人。战事首在南线，由汤恩伯指挥下发动，沿长江由来安至南通一线，向解放区深入百余里。当在如皋、泰兴一带遭受新四军歼灭打击，蒋军损失两万人以上，乃急由杭州等地调来六十五等三个军增援，侵陷之天长城、如皋城及泰州以东之姜堰镇，现正继续进攻，企图夺取盱眙、邵伯、曲塘、海安等地。沿津浦线南段徐州至蚌埠五百里线上出动之蒋军，正分向路东路西进攻，已各扩展五十里至百里不等。进攻淮北路东蒋军，以第七、四十八、五十八等军为主力，于二十二日侵陷灵壁城，并继续余犯，于二十八日占领苏皖七专署所在地的泗县城。进攻淮北路西蒋军，于十八日再度陷萧县，十九日陷濉溪口后，其一目标为河南省极东之永城。自徐州向东南沿线海公路进犯之蒋军，于侵占双沟、褚兰之半孤线后，企图进窥睢宁城。与陆上进攻同时，蒋军有七艘美国赠与之军舰及空军第六大队五十多架飞机，配合行动。蒋介石在这一进攻作战中，已将江浙地区部队全部移作赌注。国民党宣传机关人命叫嚣“共军威胁京沪”，甚至造作图谋暴动谣言，但其进攻天长的七十四军，却正是原来南京的警卫部队汤恩伯部，而布防崇明、昆山的十一军，原任京沪沿线警备，现已被充作进攻苏中的机动兵团。纵然如此，蒋军前线指挥官犹然感到这一仗并无多大把握，尤其是四十九军主力在如皋地区被歼，对蒋军士气影响甚大。
    （２）中原方面：中共中原部队分路突围后，平汉路西李先念亲率之一部，已横过丹江，进入陕南商南、山阳一带，蒋介石派遣六个师尾追数千里，并调胡宗南军四个师在荆紫关、漫川关等地堵击”，复于十七日三次电令各军，务于荆金关以南地区将李部包围歼灭，以是战况异常激烈。十九日至二十一日三天中，蒋军曾形成五个包围圈，但均为他先念部所一一冲破，胜利突出重围。可笑的是蒋介石一面悬赏三百万缉拿李先念，同时却要李司令员到龙驹寨会谈调处。向西突围之另一部王树声部，已进至鄂豫陕边境武当山地区，蒋军以三个师追击，并调川军出川东北堵击，二十二日在保康北一战，被我歼灭四百余人。至于向东突围部队一部已进入安全地带，另两部正在豫东之光山、宣化店与皖西之太湖、潜山一带，与蒋军进行反“围剿”战争中，闻蒋军正由江西抽调第四军吴奇伟部两个师增援北上，将当有一场激战。在此次追击与堵击中原各路突围部队中，蒋军手忙足乱，不仅中下级军官与士兵感觉厌倦，而且某高级军官也认为未能将中原部队“围歼”是一大失败，但蒋介石仍在惩办“作战不力”之部属，严令继续追堵。
    （３）山西方面：晋南汾河三角洲，自胡宗南之第一军及二十七军增援后，战事复趋激烈，同蒲路沿线同时展开激战。于侵占张（店）茅（津）公路后，复攻陷闻喜城，八路军被迫自卫，在闻喜以西地区将蒋阎军先后歼灭五个团。现蒋阎军正继续进攻，企图向北打通闻喜至临汾间的铁路线。晋南第二条铁路——白晋线的中点沁县城，是阎锡山收编的伪军段炳昌部插进晋东南解放区的一把小刀，当地民众在八路军支援下，于二十一日晚解除该伪武装，并解放沁县城及其以北的伪军据点数处，现白晋线南关以南全部为八路军控制，沁县、武乡地区都获解放，山西中部，阎锡山联合日伪军侵陷汾阳、文水、交城大片平川地区后，并向吕梁山地带继续进攻。同时，大同阎军亦沿同蒲、平绥两路向南、向东窜犯，以相呼应。晋绥及冀晋八路军采取自卫行动，相继解除朔县、宁武、山阴、繁峙、代县、崞县、五台、定襄、原平、忻口等地阎伪军武装。至此，同蒲北段五百里铁路线上，已无伪军踪迹，五台与吕梁两大山麓连成一片。
    （４）山东方面：山东战事正沿胶济线继续进行中，蒋介石集中五个军，以济南、潍县、青岛为基点，相互接应，分头猛攻，侵陷邹平、章邱、张店、周村淄川、博山、胶县后，二十三日再度侵占益都，并将进攻高密城，及尚在新四军保卫中的其他车站，以图打通胶济全线。同时，济南东北之济阳城，亦展开激烈争夺战，渤海八路军经过三十六小时的血战，于十八日恢复该城，蒋军被歼千余，又被进犯军再度侵陷。
    此外秦皇岛新开到蒋军五十三军，正沿北宁路布防，图联合即在冀东、热东地区的九个军，沿锦承、平古、北宁等路进攻冀热辽地区，以隔断东北与华北解放区的自卫联系。
    在东北，蒋军利用调处的掩盖，巩固已侵占地区，大批抓捕壮丁，补其伤亡缺额。并随时准备从中、南、北三面进攻安东。
