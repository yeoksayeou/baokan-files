　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. Some senior officials in the U.S. government are considering halting military aid to Chiang Kai-shek. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 21st, senior U.S. officials are considering completely ceasing the shipment of military supplies and arms to the Chinese government. The Associated Press stated: According to news from Washington, the majority of weapons under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act have made the Kuomintang extremists even more arrogant, which will transform the scattered battles in various places into a full-scale civil war in China, and U.S. policy will inevitably fail as a result. Washington officials are generally considering the issue of prohibiting the shipment of military supplies and arms to China in a situation of despair. The value of the U.S. Lend-Lease materials, including military supplies, received by the Kuomintang government is more than $1.5 billion. "Certain authorities in Washington firmly believe that if the Kuomintang army were not so well-equipped, it might be more amenable to calls for cooperation with the Communist Party." The dispatch concluded: "A full-scale civil war in China will raise some extremely delicate issues for U.S. foreign policy, namely, if the U.S. aids Chiang, will the Soviet Union aid the Communists? Can the UN organization do anything about a civil war in one of the five major powers?" A United Press report on July 24th stated: "As news of escalating military actions between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party floods in, some authoritative officials have begun to discuss: If the Chinese side publicly announces a civil war, what actions can the United States take? The discussion seems to follow two main lines: First, if the situation is beyond repair, can the United States continue to aid Chiang? And should the United States adopt other attitudes? Such as possibly recognizing the CCP as a legitimate belligerent party." The dispatch also stated: "Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching Ling's declaration that reactionary elements in China and the United States seem eager for war and calling on the United States to stop aiding the Kuomintang government seems to have further agitated the situation in Washington."
    
    Another dispatch from the Ta Kung Pao's New York correspondent on July 24th stated: "The reporter spoke with a senior U.S. official on the 23rd, who said: 'Hoping for a peaceful, democratic, and unified China is not only beneficial to the United States politically and economically, but also beneficial to the entire Far East and the world. It is impossible for the United States to help one party in China eliminate another party.'"

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. Chongqing, Associated Press, Washington, July 22nd: Leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives indicated in an off-the-record statement that with the Congressional adjournment approaching, there is virtually no opportunity to pass a bill to aid China in training a million troops (i.e., the military aid to Chiang bill). Note: The U.S. Congress adjourned on August 1st and will reconvene when the new Congress is formed on January 3rd of next year.

　　美政府若干高级人员
    考虑停止军事援蒋
    【新华社延安六日电】美国政府有若干高级人员，正在考虑停止军事援蒋。据美联社华盛顿二十一日电报导：美高级官员正在考虑完全停止军火军器运给中国政府。美联社称：据华盛顿方面消息，美国军备租借法项下大部武器，已使国民党极端派更为嚣张，将使现在各处之零星战事集零为整，演成中国全面内战，美国政策必因之失败。华府官方，大致系在绝望情势中始考虑禁止军火军器运华问题。国民党政府所接获美国租借物资，包括军火在内，约值十五万万美元以上。“华府某某当局深信，国民党军配备如不如此充分，则对吁请其与共产党合作或更能听从。”该电讯最后称：“中国全面内战，对于美国外交政策更将引起若干极其微妙之问题，即美国助蒋则苏联是否将助共。联合国机构对于五强之一国发生内战，能有所作为吗？”七月二十四日美联社报导：“日来国共军事行动转剧之消息如雪片飞来，若干权威官员已开始议论：如果中国方面竟公然宣布内战，则美国能有何种行动？议论似循两大路线进行：一，如情势不堪收拾，美国能否继续援蒋？而美国应否采取他种态度？如可能承认中共为合法的交战方面。”该电讯又称：“孙夫人宋庆龄宣言谓中美两国反动分子，似急于求战，并吁请美国停止援助国民党政府，似已使华府方面情况更为激动”。
    另据大公报纽约特派员七月二十四日专电称：“记者二十三日与一美高级官吏谈话，该高级官吏表示：‘希望和平民主统一的中国，这不但在政治与经济上对美国有利，对整个远东与全世界也是有利的。美国要帮助中国这一党消灭另一党，决不可能。’”
    【新华社延安六日电】渝美联社华府七月二十二日讯：参众两院领袖在会外表示，国会闭会之期已近，实际上殆无通过援助中国训练百万军队的法案之机会（即军事援蒋法案）。按：美国国会已于八月一日休会，至明年一月三日新国会成立时复会。
