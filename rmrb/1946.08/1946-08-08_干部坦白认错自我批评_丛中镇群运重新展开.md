　　Cadres Frankly Confess Mistakes and Make Self-Criticisms
    Congzhong Town Mass Movement Restarted
    [This Newspaper, Handan News] Recently, Congzhong Town in this county resolved the issue of unity between cadres and the masses, and restarted the mass movement. The village had undergone struggle sessions this spring, but they were extremely incomplete. Illegal landlords and usurers were only fined, and that was the end of it. Many problems were not resolved, and the fines were reduced privately by the cadres. The distribution of the remaining portion was also extremely inappropriate. Apart from a small amount given to the "victims," the majority was taken by the cadres, and the masses received very little. In addition, the cadres also received land from the landlords as "support," which led to their gradual degeneration and disregard for the masses. All of this caused dissatisfaction among the masses towards the cadres, leading to the stagnation of the movement. After the Reversal Team × Group from the Military and Political University arrived in the village, they quickly understood the situation. They allowed the masses to offer suggestions to the cadres, and worked with the cadres to settle the accounts of the struggle sessions, enlightening the cadres to frankly reflect on their mistakes to the masses. After three days of fermentation and three days of mass meetings, the grievances in the masses' hearts were all vented, and the cadres also frankly confessed their mistakes and made self-criticisms to the masses. At this time, the leadership also explained to the masses the past contributions of the cadres. The masses also unanimously recognized that the cadres were all poor people and were on their side. As long as they corrected their mistakes, they should be forgiven. Therefore, the excess fruits that the cadres had taken and the land they had received as "support" from the landlords were forgiven by the masses, and they were not asked to return them. The cadres also expressed that they would resolutely correct their mistakes in the future. Following this, the peasant association was rectified, and peasant association members were re-elected. The new members publicly swore that they would resolutely lead the masses to thoroughly stand up, not be greedy, not be corrupt, not be bought or exploited by the landlords, unite with each other, etc., and led all the peasant association members to swear: "Cadres and the masses must unite together!" After this resolution, the masses' enthusiasm for struggle was greatly enhanced, and a new struggle is brewing. (Jiang Feng, Li Yiyong)

　　干部坦白认错自我批评
    丛中镇群运重新展开
    【本报邯郸讯】本县丛中镇最近解决了干部与群众的团结问题，重新开展了群运。该村今春曾经过斗争，但极不彻底，对违法的地主高利贷者，只罚了一些款就完了。许多问题并未解决，而罚款又被干部私自减轻。剩余部分的分配亦极为不当，除给“苦主”一部外，大部为干部所得，群众分得很少。此外，干部又得到地主“拥护”给他们的地，以致逐渐蜕化，不管群众了。这些都引起群众对干部不满，使运动陷于停滞。军政大学翻身队×小组到达该村后，很快了解了这一情况，即一面让群众给干部提意见，一面会同干部清算斗争果实账目，启发干部向群众坦白反省。经过三天酝酿、三天大会后，群众肚里的气都吐出来了，干部也分别向群众坦白认错自我批评。此时，领导上又向群众解释干部过去的功劳，群众也一致认识干部都是穷人，都是自己人。只要改过，就应原谅他们。于是过去干部多分的果实和接受地主“拥护”的地，都得到群众的原谅而没有让他们退出来。干部也表示自己以后要坚决改正错误。接着整顿农会组织，改选农会委员，新委员当众宣誓：要坚决领导群众彻底翻身，不贪污，不腐化，不受地主收买利用，互相团结等，并领导全体农会会员宣誓：“干部和群众要全体团结起来！”这样解决以后，群众斗争情绪大大提高，新的斗争已在酝酿中。（姜峰、李一庸）
