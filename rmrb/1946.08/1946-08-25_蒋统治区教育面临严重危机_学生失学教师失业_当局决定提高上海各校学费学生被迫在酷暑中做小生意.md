Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 22nd: According to the Central News Agency and the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, education in major cities under Kuomintang rule faces a major crisis. In the four cities of Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan alone, more than 670,000 young people and children are out of school. In Beiping, known as the national education center, 480,000 children are currently out of school. Some schools have no equipment at all, using bricks as chairs and boards as tables. Tianjin has more than 90,000 children out of school, and Qingdao has more than 42,700. Shanghai schools have decided that the number of young people and children dropping out due to lack of tuition fees will increase significantly this semester. The campus of Nanjing Central University is still occupied by the military, and there is no date set for the start of the next semester. Guangzhou has a total of 100,000 primary school students, but the existing primary schools only accommodate more than 40,000, less than half of those seeking education. Ren Huapeng, the principal of Guangzhou Municipal Normal School, recently wrote an article in the Ta Kung Pao entitled "Difficulty in Studying," pointing out that school fees are extremely high, costing each student more than 300,000 yuan per semester, which most parents cannot afford. Even if they have the money, the complicated procedures such as transfer certificates make enrollment very difficult. Seeking education is as difficult as seeking a job, involving endless efforts to curry favor and seek advice. Ren also mentioned that as the principal of a normal school, he could not get his own son into primary school despite many attempts.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 22nd: More than a thousand primary school teachers in Shanghai have not received contracts for the next semester. According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao: On the 23rd of last month, the Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Job Security Association and the Primary School Teachers' Job Security Promotion Association jointly hosted reporters, stating that schools have already dismissed teachers in more than a dozen cases. Out of more than 1,900 primary school teachers in the city, only 480 have received contracts, accounting for only one-fifth of the total. They stated: "This is not just a personal career problem for teachers, but a problem of the entire education construction." Finally, they made four demands to the education authorities, including guaranteeing teachers' jobs, and appealed to society for support.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 22nd: According to the Shanghai United Evening News, the Kuomintang authorities have decided to increase tuition fees for all schools in Shanghai next semester. University tuition fees are approximately between 150,000 and 300,000 yuan. As a result, many university and middle school students have to engage in various small businesses in the scorching heat to cope with the soaring tuition fees. Science students at Nantong College have created a "selling vegetables to help with tuition" method. Participating students are divided into groups by region to inquire with residents about their daily vegetable needs, then purchase vegetables in bulk at the market and deliver them to households throughout the day. Some students at Yuying Middle School sell popsicles or cigarettes on the streets, while students at Zhijiang University make and sell oil and paper fans, with advertisements for stores printed on the paper fans. Female students at Zhijiang University make candy and mooncakes. Students at Nanping Girls' Middle School collectively sew and sell women's bras. Students at Jiancheng Middle School have organized a consumer cooperative to sell candles, and the practice of making and selling handkerchief paper flowers is even more common.

　　蒋统治区教育面临严重危机
　　学生失学教师失业
　　当局决定提高上海各校学费学生被迫在酷暑中做小生意
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据中央社及上海大公报透露，国民党统治下之各大城市教育面临极大危机，仅平、津、青、济四地失学的青年儿童，即达六十七万余名。素称全国教育中心的北平市，现有失学儿童四十八万名，某些学校设备全无，以砖头当椅子，板子当桌子。天津失学儿童有九万余名，青岛失学儿童也达四万二千七百余人，上海各校决定于本年上学期因无学费失学的青年儿童将大量增加。南京中大校舍至今仍被军队占用，下学期开学无期。广州共有小学生十万，现有之小学一共仅有小学生四万余人，与求学人数相差一半以上。广州市立师范学校校长任华朋近以“读书难”为题，在大公报著论指出各校收费奇昂，每生每学期需费三十余万元，一般家长无力负担，即使有钱，也因转学证等手续繁杂，入学亦甚困难。求学难如求职，钻营请教，无所不用其极。任氏并称他身为师范校长，有一子竟无法进小学，诸多设法，仍被摒校外。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】沪市小学教师已有千余人未接到下学期聘书。据沪大公报载：上月二十三日，沪中学教师职业保障会及小学教师职业保障促进会联合招待记者称：校方解聘教师已达十数起，全市小学教师一千九百余人，其中接到聘书者仅四百八十人，占全数五分之一。并称：这不仅是教师个人职业问题，而是整个教育建设问题。最后向教育当局提出保障教师职业等四项要求，并吁请社会声援。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据沪联合晚报称：国民党当局决定提高沪市各校下学期学费，大学学费约在十五万至三十万之间。以致一般大中学生不能不在酷暑中经营各种小生意，以应付高涨之学费。南通学院里科学生创造“卖菜助学”办法，参加同学按地区分组换户探询居民每日所需要菜，再至市场批购，全天一批按户分送。育英中学一部分同学则往街头叫卖冰棒或贩卖香烟，之江大学同学制发油及纸扇出卖，在纸扇上则登商店广告。之江女生则制糖果月饼。南屏女中同学集体缝制女用胸围推销。建成同学则组织消费合作社售制蜡烛出售，至制售手巾纸花者更为普遍。
