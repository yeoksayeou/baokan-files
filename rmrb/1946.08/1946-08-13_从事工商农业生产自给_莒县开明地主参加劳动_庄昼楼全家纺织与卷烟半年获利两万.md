(Linyi, 9th) In Ju County, Shandong Province, enlightened landlords support the democratic government's policy of self-sufficiency through production and actively engage in industrial, commercial, and agricultural production. Datian Town, more than 30 li from the county seat, is the hometown of the Zhuang family, a well-known landlord family in Shandong. The story of the masses overturning the "Eagle Tomb" of Zhuang the Devil in a vigorous campaign occurred in this town the year before last. There are currently 57 landlord families in the town, engaged in various businesses such as commerce, weaving, spinning, and cigarette rolling. For example, Zhuang Jinggen raised capital to establish a cooperative and served as its manager. In just over a year, his personal shares have increased from 500 yuan (each yuan worth 20 legal currency) to more than 17,000 yuan, and his annual salary has reached more than 10,000 yuan. He said, "The commerce in our liberated area is developed, and doing business has a bright future." Zhuang Shelin opened Yongsheng Pharmacy, and his daughter is engaged in cigarette rolling. The income, in addition to covering the family's food and clothing, has a surplus. Zhuang Zhoulou's family engages in spinning, weaving, and cigarette rolling, earning more than 20,000 yuan in six months. He happily said, "My family is self-sufficient through production, and life is very comfortable. I can even drink two liang of wine with every meal." Liu Chengheng runs a mill, earning 28 or 29 jin for every 100 jin of wheat ground. His family of five also has a monthly surplus after covering living expenses. He told people, "As long as landlords work hard, they will definitely be wealthy."
