　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: TASS, New York, 2nd: Soong Ching Ling's recent statement opposing American interference in China's internal affairs has been endorsed by a wide range of progressive people in the United States. Progressive members of the US House of Representatives have also risen up to oppose the US's policy of military aid to China. Representative Savage, a Democrat from Washington state (a supporter of the New Deal), strongly stated that the US government continues to supply military goods to China after the end of the Lend-Lease Act, without informing the American people. He pointed out that the surplus materials on Okinawa and other islands in the Pacific are enough to equip one million American troops. The US government is currently negotiating to sell these weapons to the Kuomintang government, as part of a new plan to lend China $500 million. He further pointed out that during the war, Chinese officials had deposits of $1 billion to $2 billion in the United States. He questioned why the Chinese government did not use these private deposits before the new plan to lend money to China was implemented. Savage accused some people of being responsible for the crime of helping China's civil war and threatening peace and security. Savage demanded that the US authorities stop this hypocritical policy. Mrs. Roosevelt agreed with Soong Ching Ling's statement, believing that giving up military intervention to promote peace is welcomed by the American people. Washington Post reporter Barnaby said: The United States speaks of peace, but it helps the Kuomintang government with economy and weapons.

　　美国广大进步人士谴责当局军事援华
    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社纽约二日电：不久前宋庆龄夫人反对美国干涉中国内政的声明，获得美国广大进步人士的赞成，美国进步的众议员亦纷起反对美国军事援华政策。华盛顿州民主党众议员沙瓦治（按系新政拥护者）力称：美政府在租借法案完结后，仍继续供应中国军事物品，而并没有将此事通知美国人民。他指出在冲绳岛及太平洋其他岛屿上的剩余物资，足以装备一百万美军，美国政府现时正进行谈判，将这些武器出卖给国民党政府，为作借予中国五亿美元的新计划。他继指出：在战时，中国官场要人在美的存款达十亿至二十亿美元，他质向在美国予中国贷款的新计划实现前，中国政府为什样不利用这些私人存款？沙氏指责某些人说，它们应对帮助中国内战，威胁和平与安全的罪恶负责。沙氏要求美国当局停止这一虚伪的政策。罗斯福夫人赞成宋庆龄夫人的声明，认为为促进和平，放弃军事干涉，这是美国人民所欢迎的。华盛顿邮报记者巴纳威说：美国在口头上讲和平，可是在经济与武器上帮助国民党政府。
