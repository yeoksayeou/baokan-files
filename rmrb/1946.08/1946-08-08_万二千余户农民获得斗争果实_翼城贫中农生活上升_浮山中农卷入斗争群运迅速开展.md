　　[By Our Correspondent in Yangcheng] Since February, Yicheng County has undergone an earth-shaking peasant emancipation movement. Except for eighteen small mountain villages accounting for 0.5% of the population, the entire county has launched struggles against traitors and bullies or rent reduction and debt liquidation campaigns, destroying the feudal landlord and tyrant rule. The class composition of the rural areas has undergone drastic changes. According to statistics from early June, peasant households that have gained the fruits of struggle account for more than 83% of the total number of households in the second and fourth districts. Although the third district is an old liberated area, it also accounts for 50.2%. In total, 12,493 households in the county have gained from the struggle. All extreme poverty has been eliminated in the second district, with 315 of the 494 tenant farmers rising to the level of middle peasants, and 120 rising to the level of poor peasants. 944 poor peasant households have risen to the level of middle peasants, and 36 have risen to the level of rich peasants. 51 middle peasant households have also risen to the level of rich peasants. In Shangwu Village in the district, out of 37 tenant farmer households, 15 have risen to poor peasants, 20 have risen to middle peasants, and 1 has risen to rich peasants; only 1 household remained unchanged. The original 95 poor peasant households saw 42 rise to middle peasants and 6 rise to rich peasants. The number of rich peasants has surged from 16 to 42. In the third district, of the original 201 tenant farmer households, 105 have now obtained land, and 96 are farming public land, no longer subject to exploitation by landlords. Of the 7,546 poor peasant households, 1,809 have risen in status. The number of middle peasants has surged from the original 6,534 to 10,163. All 67 extremely poor households in Pengsi Village in the district have been eliminated: 51 have risen to poor peasants, and 16 have risen to middle peasants. The number of middle peasants has increased from 43 to 100. In the fourth district, of the original 1,523 extremely poor households, only 83 now remain. This change has brought infinite joy to the vast number of peasants. Everyone says, "The world has changed!" The masses in Shangwu Village often recall the tragic history of the "Four Heavenly Kings" and "Eight Great Vajras" (referring to the village's ruling clique) and their bloody rule, during which 55 people died unnaturally, and most peasant families suffered from cold, hunger, or fled from famine. They unanimously celebrated today's new life, saying, "I never thought we could have this day!" "This is truly emancipation!" The village has now established a strong peasant association of more than 1,300 people, and held a grand demonstration parade during its founding.
    [By Our Correspondent in Yangcheng] The movement of speaking out about suffering and seeking revenge, and of rent reduction and debt liquidation, in Fushan County, has been widely developed to all administrative villages and 85% of natural villages. Among them, 20% of the villages have already shifted to production. This movement began after clearing up the unfavorable situation since mid-March, in which the direction was unclear, the style of monopolizing everything and not letting go was apparent, resulting in the stagnation of the movement, the isolation of a few advanced masses, and the landlords taking the opportunity to counterattack. At that time, it was clearly proposed to vigorously carry out speaking out about suffering and seeking revenge, and quickly transition to rent and interest reduction. It is necessary to let go and mobilize the majority of the masses and strike at the worst rulers. This has made cadres and the masses active from being depressed. The county-wide, vigorous struggle quickly unfolded. The phenomenon of indiscriminate struggle against all objects in the past has been automatically stopped by the masses. The vast number of middle peasants have consciously joined the wave of struggle and played an active role, many of whom have already joined the peasant association, accounting for more than a quarter of the new members of the peasant association. One-third of middle peasant families (approximately 3,340 households) have received one-tenth of all the fruits of struggle: totaling 2,600 mu of land, 4,100 shi of grain, 155 head of cattle and donkeys, etc. This has greatly improved the mood of the vast number of middle peasants, who have realized the truth that "working peasants are one family."

　　万二千余户农民获得斗争果实
    翼城贫中农生活上升
    浮山中农卷入斗争群运迅速开展
    【本报阳城讯】翼城经过二月份以来翻天覆地的农民翻身运动，全县除了占人口百分之○·五的十八个小山庄外，全部掀起反奸霸或减租清债斗争，摧垮了封建地主恶霸统治，农村的阶级成份已起了急剧变化。据六月初统计，获得斗争果实的农家，在二、四区各占总户数百分之八十三以上。三区虽为老区，也占百分之五十点二，全县合计获得斗争者共有一万二千四百九十三户。二区赤贫全部消灭，四百九十四户佃农有三百一十五户上升为中农，一百二十户上升为贫农。贫农有九百四十四户升为中农，三十六户升为富农。中农也有五十一户升为富农。该区上吴村三十七户佃农，十五户升为贫农，二十户升为中农，一户升为富农，只有一户没动。贫农原有九十五户，四十二户升为中农，六户升为富农。富农由十六户激增到四十二户。三区原有佃农二百零一户，现在一百零五户获得土地，九十六户种着公田，都不再受地主的盘剥了。贫农七千五百四十六户，有一千八百零九户上升。中农由原来的六千五百三十四户激增至一万零一百六十三户。该区蓬司村原有六十七户赤贫全部消灭：五十一户升为贫农，十六户升为中农。中农由四十三户增至一百户。四区原有赤贫一千五百二十三户，现亦只剩八十三户了。这个变化给广大农民带来无穷的欢喜。人人都说：“世界变了样。”上吴村群众常常回忆着以前“四大天王”、“八大金刚”（均为该村统治集团）的血手魔刀统治时代，五十五人死于非命，大部农家冻饿或逃荒的悲惨史实，异口同声庆祝着今天的新生说：“真想不到能有今天！”“这可真是翻身了！”该村现已成立了一千三百余人的强大农会，并在成立时举行盛大示威游行。
    【本报阳城讯】浮山县的诉苦复仇与减租清债运动，已经普遍发展到所有行政村与百分之八十五的自然村。其中有十分之二的村庄已转入生产。这次运动，是从三月中旬清算了过去的方向不明确、包办代替不放手作风，以及由此造成的运动停滞，少数先进群众孤立，地主趁机反攻的不利形势以后开始的。当时明确提出大力开展诉苦复仇，并很快转入减租减息。要放手发动群众的大多数，打击最坏的统治者。这使干部与群众都由苦闷而活跃起来。全县规模的轰轰烈烈的斗争，很快就展开了。过去的不择对象乱斗争现象，群众自动停止了。广大中农都自觉地卷入斗争浪潮，并起了积极作用，其中有很多已经加入农会，占农会新会员四分之一以上。有三分之一的中农家庭（约三三四○户），分得全部斗争果实的十分之一：计土地二千六百亩，粮食四千一百石，牛驴一百五十五头等。这使广大中农的情绪大大提高，都认识到“劳动农民是一家”的真理。
