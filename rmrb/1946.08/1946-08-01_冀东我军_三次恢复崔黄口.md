　　Jidong Our Army
    Recovers Cuihuangkou for the Third Time
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 29th] Cuihuangkou, an important location in Wuqing County, 60 miles north of Tianjin, was recovered for the third time by the Jidong Eighth Route Army on the 18th of this month. It is reported that the town was liberated by the Eighth Route Army in October last year, but was subsequently seized by the Kuomintang army in collaboration with puppet troops. On June 11th of this year, it was recovered again, but on the 15th, it was once more occupied by the Bai Xiaowu unit and Zhang Shiming's battalion of the Wuqing puppet army's security regiment, who continued to advance to Xishizi Village, attempting to seize Dakoutun (an important town northeast of Cuihuangkou). The long-term occupation of the town by the Chiang and puppet troops turned more than one hundred square miles from Yingjiashan to Dabai Village and west of Cuihuangkou into a "no-man's land." Of the six districts in Wuqing County, a total of 131 villages and towns were occupied by the puppet troops in the town. In April alone, 35 cadres from the liberated areas were captured and killed by them, more than 200 people were killed or wounded, and hundreds of thousands of catties of grain were looted. The recovery of the town this time has strengthened the barrier south of Baodi, giving tens of thousands of people a new lease on life, and everyone is full of praise and celebration.

　　冀东我军
    三次恢复崔黄口
    【新华社遵化二十九日电】天津北六十里武清县境重地崔黄口，已于本月十八日为冀东八路军三次恢复。按该镇于去年十月间为八路军解放，旋为国民党军协同伪军夺取，今年六月十一日再度恢复后，十五日复为武清伪军保安团柏小五部张士明大队所侵占，并继续进至西十字村，图夺取大口屯（崔黄口东北重镇）。该镇在蒋伪军长期盘据下，使附近营家山至大白庄及崔黄口以西百余平方里成为“无人区”。武清县六个区共有一三一个村镇为该镇伪军侵占，解放区干部为其捕杀者，四月份即达三十五人，群众被杀伤者二百余人，粮食被抢数十万斤。此次该镇恢复，加强了宝坻南面的屏障，数万群众获得生机，莫不额首称庆。
