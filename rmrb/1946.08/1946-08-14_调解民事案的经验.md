　　Experiences in Mediating Civil Cases
    Suo Lin

    "Mediation is the mass line in judicial work for civil cases (and individual criminal cases)."

    In the first half of last year, the Cixian County Judicial Section received and concluded 76 civil cases, of which 75 were settled through mediation. In the second half of the year, a total of 174 cases were received, and with the exception of 27 unresolved cases, only 2 cases were appealed (and even these appeals were settled through mediation by the Special Commissioner's Office). This illustrates that the mediation policy is entirely correct. "Mediation" is a delicate and arduous work of persuasion and education, so mediation is no easier than adjudication. Writing a judgment only requires following the interrogation, arguments, case details, and laws, and a judgment can be issued regardless of whether both parties accept it or not; while mediation aims to strengthen mass unity, so it is necessary to eliminate contradictions based on the principle of voluntary participation by both parties. This requires understanding the psychology of the parties, exposing their intentions, and paying attention to political and educational methods in order to convince both parties sincerely. Therefore, the following points should be noted when conducting mediation:

    (1) Adequate Preparation in Advance

    A thorough investigation of the temperament, demands, family circumstances, and the entire case of both parties should be conducted in advance to allow for refutation and explanation based on laws and facts during mediation, preventing demands from being too high or too low. This is the key to determining the success or failure of mediation. For example, in the land dispute between Gong Xingzheng of Gongjia Village and his sister-in-law, Gong Zhou, it was discovered through investigation that some village cadres were biased towards Gong Xingzheng's localism, fearing that the land would be lost. In addition, Gong Zhou was a foul-mouthed woman, and the neighbors were dissatisfied with her. Gong Xingzheng was also from a "large and prosperous family," so everyone "supported the bamboo pole and not the well rope" (supported those with power). Gong Zhou's backing was her maternal brother, Zhou Yougui. Therefore, in understanding the case, one must first understand these factors in order to accurately examine and analyze the materials, otherwise it is easy to be deceived and wronged. Another example is the case of small businessman Qiao Liye and Wang Rongjin et al. concerning business account differences. Recognizing that the general characteristic of this group of people was "fondness of petty advantages," this point was seized upon, and both parties were persuaded. Afterward, not only was there no resentment, but an order for goods was immediately placed to continue doing business.

    (2) Democratic Discussion Should Be Used to Discover the Focus of Dispute

    In individual interrogations or conversations, the focus of the dispute between the two parties should be identified. At this time, our attitude must be calm and amiable. A farmer or worker who has never been involved in a lawsuit will speak tediously. In particular, women will bring up even the smallest details, and sometimes they may stray far from the topic. We can interrupt and guide them, but we must never put on a stern face, otherwise they will "not dare to speak," and it will be difficult for you to understand their suffering and even harder to find the center of the dispute. Mediation will fail if you lose control of the center. For example, the aforementioned land case in Gongjia Village was actually an inheritance issue, but it appeared as a dispute over seven fen of land at the entrance, which led to lawsuits for more than a year, five mediations (one by the head of the family, two by village cadres, and two by the district office), and involved twelve administrators. After the mediation, instead of "turning small things into nothing," the initial dispute over seven fen of land "turned small things into big things," and even affected more than two mu of land on the eastern mountain. In the end, a re-division of the family property was proposed. This was entirely due to the bias of the original administrators (village cadres) and the failure of the district office to discover the focus of the dispute, which incited both parties to raise even bigger issues. However, after discovering the above situation, and after individual talks with the administrators and Zhou Yougui (Gong Zhou's backer), a democratic discussion was launched. Good and bad people were recognized, and the center of the intention to raise issues was exposed. As a result, both parties calmly accepted the mediation.

    Failing to find the center of the issue can turn small things into big things. It is common to file a lawsuit "to fight for a breath of air." Last summer, Sun Damei of Sun Village (which was then an enemy-occupied area), an influential person in the village, had a case of land pawn with his nephew. The village chief, in handling the case, said that his contract was "bullshit." So he seized on this point and said, "Private matters are based on contracts, official matters are based on seals." You say mine is "bullshit," I must have the county magistrate take a look at it." So, after going through the district office, all the way to the county, he insisted on this point. After we explained that his contract could be used as evidence, he deflated. Then we explained to him, "Village cadres are workers and peasants, our own people, who speaks without thinking!" After explaining the reasoning, he accepted the mediation. If we do not calmly allow the parties to vent what they consider to be grievances in such lawsuits arising from resentment, where people are "willing to sell two mu of land to fight for a breath of air" and "would rather have less things than have their name unmentioned," we will not only fail to find the center of the problem, but even extend it to other parts. As the saying goes, "When your Qi is smooth, you can cross mountains and seas," which means that one cannot convince the parties unless the reasoning is clear.

    (3) Issues of Methods and Approaches in Mediation

    "Even if you have a good heart, it's useless if your methods are bad." So methods and approaches are shortcuts to help us succeed in mediation. In the process of mediation, it is best to talk individually first, and encourage the parties to make requests and solutions. In explaining or refuting, avoid having both parties present at the same time (if necessary, it is possible), because "people have faces, trees have bark," and some places cannot stand criticism. Before the government comes forward to mediate, others should do it first. If the mediation fails, then participate in the mediation. Sometimes others can be effective. For example, in the matter of divorce and alimony, the woman often asks for a lot and the man pays less. We must explain the actual difficulties, specific examples, and educate both parties, persuade her to reduce it as much as possible, and encourage her to remarry as soon as possible. As long as we grasp the spirit of policies and laws, the problem will be resolved harmoniously.

    Methods are not rigid dogmas, and should be used flexibly. For example, in the land dispute between Han Zhang and Chen Yuquan, due to stubborn adherence to the old methods (believing that money is omnipotent and can solve everything), although Chen Yuquan was reasonable and from a wealthy family, the mediator mobilized Chen Yuquan to give 3,000 yuan to Han Zhang in order to resolve the problem without going to court, and the case was closed. Afterwards, Han Zhang and some people reflected and said, "Chen Yuquan was still unreasonable! He is not stupid, why would he give money if he was in the right!?" We should abandon this kind of superficial style of "solving the problem for the sake of solving the problem" without solving ideological problems and without education.

    The mediator is best recommended by the parties themselves (they only believe in the people they find themselves). Based on our experience, marriage issues are handled by cadres from the Youth League and Women's Federation, family inheritance is handled by parents, land disputes are handled by neighbors and peasant association chairmen, and cases involving the military are handled by military leaders. It is not necessary for cadres to handle everything (because some ordinary people do not believe in village cadres). "All impartial persons who are familiar with the incident, are eager to do good, and are relatives and friends are acceptable" (see Border Region Government Order). The appearance that emerges should be public if it is public, and private if it is private. Do not adhere to conventions. As for the number of people, it can be determined according to the complexity of the case and the opinions of the parties.

    After mediation, it is necessary to write three or four copies of the mediation agreement (one each for the original and defendant parties, the mediator, and the file), because the masses believe that "this piece of paper (referring to the mediation agreement) is more important than a contract." This is an indispensable procedure. The content should be written in their own words, but it must state the cause of the dispute, the process and method of resolution, the opinions of both parties on the mediation, the time and place of the mediation, and the signatures and seals (or fingerprints) of the mediator and the parties to be appropriate.

    (4) Listen to Feedback After Mediation

    "Mediation" is a good way for us to solve problems for the masses, but with a little carelessness, it is easy to misunderstand public opinion. Therefore, it is necessary to listen to the feedback of the masses after mediation as a lesson for the future. For example, when the land pawn case in Sun Village was concluded, Sun Damei said, "I will never do anything for the enemy again." His nephew also expressed his intention to join the guerrilla group. After the democratic discussion of the land dispute in Gongjia Village, the head of the family said, "Our village is like one person, everyone knows who is good and who is bad!" Last winter, in dealing with marriage issues during the disaster year, we had to take care of the difficulty of poor peasants getting married and also take care of the woman's willingness. Based on this principle, in the second half of last year alone, out of the 96 cases we handled, 28 women returned to their former husbands, 51 women remained with their later husbands, and 17 women found other partners. These were all mediated after educating both parties. As the masses reflected, "The government is just capable, and always makes both sides happy." But we also have failed lessons. Last July, we mediated the business dispute between Xi Yinsheng and Kong Fanshu. The district and village both said that Xi Yinsheng was "unreasonable," and we also said that he was unreasonable. Later, it was reluctantly mediated. Although Xi Yinsheng got another sum of money, he still looked sad and did not smile. Soon, a local worker wrote a letter saying, "The handling was inappropriate." Who was wronged? It is still not clear, and this is worth examining.

    In short, our mediation has already gained the praise of the masses: "In the past, a lawsuit meant ten years of hatred, but now the more lawsuits are fought, the more harmonious they become."

    These are just some fragmented experiences, which are far from our requirements. We hope to offer a humble opinion and discuss further. (June 1, 1946, at the Cixian County Judicial Section)

　　调解民事案的经验
    索麟
    “调解是司法工作中民事案件（个别刑案）的群众路线”。
    磁县司法科，去年前半年收结七十六个民事案件，即有七十五个调解结案。后半年共收一百七十四案，除二十七案未结外，只有二案上诉（上诉后也经专署调解结案）。由此说明调解方针是完全正确的。“调解”是一种细致的坚苦的说服教育工作，所以调解并不比判决容易，写判决只要根据讯问、辩论、及案情和法令，不管双方接受与否迳可下判；而调解的话是为了加强群众团结，所以要在双方自愿的原则下消除矛盾，就必需摸中当事人的心理，揭发他的企图，在政治上，教育方式上注意，才会使双方心悦诚服。所以在进行调解时要注意下面事项：
    （一）事前要有充分准备
    对双方当事人的性情、要求、家庭状况及整个案情，事前要有精密的调查，方能在调解中依据法令和事实，进行驳斥与解释，防止要求过高或过低，这是决定调解成败的关键。如巩家庄巩兴正与其弟媳巩周氏的土地纠纷，经过调查，发觉某些村干部偏擅巩兴正本位主义，怕土地跑出去，再加巩周氏是个好骂街的婆娘，邻舍对他不满，巩兴正又是“人齐家旺”，所以大家“扶竹竿不扶井绳）（扶有势之人）。巩周氏的后台，是她娘家兄弟周有贵，所以在了解案情中，就应先了解这些，才能正确的审识与分析材料，否则易受蒙蔽怨屈一方。再如小商人乔立业与王荣晋等，因营业账差一案，认识到这伙人的一般特性是“爱沾便宜”，就抓紧这点，劝道双方，事后不但没有记仇，反能当即订立货单，继续搞买卖。
    （二）发现争执焦点应用民主讨论
    在个别讯问或谈话中，应找出双方争执的焦点。这时我们的态度一定要冷静和蔼，一个没有打过官司的农民或工人，他说话是会累赘的，尤其是妇女“麻包”“线蛋”也要说出来，有时离题会远，我们可以从中插问诱导，万不可板起面孔，否则他们“有话不敢说”，你就不易了解他的苦楚，更难找见争执之中心，调解就会因失去掌握中心而遭破裂。例如上述巩家庄土地案，实系一继承问题，而出现的面貌却是争执大门口七分地，经年余累讼，先后经过五次调解（家长一次、村干二次、区上二次），牵连十二位管理人，由开始的争执七分地小事，经过调解后，不是“小事化没事”，而是“小事化大事”，更波及到东山上的二亩多地，最后还提出重新分家。这完全是由原管人（一二村干部）的偏擅，和区署未发见争执焦点，激起双方提出更大问题。但在发现上边情况之后，将有所管理人及巩周氏的后台周有贵，在个别谈话后展开民主讨论，认识了好赖人，揭穿别人企图提出问题的中心，结果双方心平气静的接受了调解。
    找不出问题中心是会把小事弄成大事的，“为争一口气”而打起官司来是常有的。去年夏天，孙庄（当时是敌占区）孙大美（村上有头脸的人），与其侄儿因典当土地一案就是村长在处理时，说了一句他的文约是“狗屁”，于是他就抓住这点说：“私凭文约、官凭印信”，你说我这是“狗屁”，我非叫县长看看不行”，所以经过区署，一直闹到县里，他就坚持这一点。在我们说明他的文约可以为凭后，他就泄气了，再向他解释“村干部是工农人，自己人，谁说话还下着线呢！”讲清道理之后，他才接受调解。这种“为争一口气，卖上二亩地”，“宁叫东西少，不叫名不在”的因负气而起的诉讼，我们如果不平心静气的让当事人把他认为的怨屈，倾吐出来，不仅找不到问题的中心，甚至扩大及于其他部分。俗语说“气顺山海过”，他的意思就是说，非将道理讲清，不足以说服当事人。
    （三）调解中的方式方法问题
    “纵然你有好心肠，方法不好也枉然”。所以方法方式是辅助我们调解成功的捷径。在调解过程中，最好先个别谈话，启发当事人提出要求和解决办法，在解释或驳斥中，忌讳双方同在（必要时也可以），因为“人有脸、树有皮”某些地方是受不起批评的。在政府出面调解之前，应先由别人进行，调解不成时，再参与调解，有时别人是会有作用的。比如离婚包赡养费一事，往往女方要求高男方出的少，我们就要把实际困难、具体例子、教育双方，说服她尽量减少，劝她及早改嫁都是可以的，只要我们掌握政策法令的精神，问题就会和美解决。
    方法不是呆板的教条，应灵活运用，如韩张氏与陈玉川的土地纠纷，由于固执旧法（认为银钱万能包钱了事），虽陈玉川有理而家境优越，所以调解人动员陈玉川，为了解决问题不打官司，拿出三千元给韩张氏而结案，事后韩张氏和一部分人反映说：“还是陈玉川没理！他又不呆、有理为啥又出钱！？”这种不解决思想问题，不加以教育的“为解决问题，而解决问题”的虚浮作风应该戒除。
    调解人最好由当事人自己荐举（只有他自己找出来的人，他才相信），根据我们经验婚姻问题由青、妇会干部，家庭继承由家长，土地纠葛由地邻、农会长，涉及部队的由部队首长，什么案件，什么人调解，不一定非干部不行（因为有些老百姓不大相信村干部），“凡熟悉事件急公好义的公正人士，亲戚邻友都可”（见边府令）。出现的面貌，该公就公、该私就私、不要墨守成规，至于人数的多寡，可视案件的复杂与当事人的意见而定。
    在调解后一定要缮写调解书三份或四份（原被双方、调解人、存卷应各一张），因群众认为：“这张纸（指调解书而言）比文约还要紧”，这是必不可少的手续。内容就用他们自己的话，写出来就行了，但必须载明争执之事由、解决的经过和办法，双方对调解的意见，调解的时间、地点，调解人及当事人签名盖章（或盖指印）才为妥贴。
    （四）调解后要听取反映
    “调解”是我们为群众排难解纷的好办法，但少有不慎，容易误会民意，所以调解之后倾听群众反映，作为以后借镜，大有必要。如孙庄土地典当一案，结案时，孙大美即说：“回去决不做敌人的事”。其侄亦表示参加游击小组。巩家庄的土地纠纷在民主讨论之后，家长说：“俺村像一个人一样，谁好谁坏，他都知道！”在去冬处理灾荒年婚姻问题，既要照顾贫农结婚困难，又要照顾女方自愿。我们用这个原则，光去年后半年，处理的九十六件中，有二十八个女人返回前夫，五十一个女人仍归后夫，十七个女人另找了对象，这都是经过对双方教育后才调解的。诚如群众反映：“政府就是有办法，总要叫两头都如意。”但我们也有失败的教训，去年七月调解席银生与孔凡枢的营商纠葛一案，区、村都说席银生“没理”，我们也说他没理，后来勉强调解了，虽然席银生又得了一部款子，可是他仍苦丧着脸，没有笑色，不久当地工作员写来一封信说：“处理不适当”。究竟谁冤？到底还不清楚，这是很值得检查的。
    总之我们的调解，在群众中已经获得：“以前一场官司，十年仇，如今越打官司越和气”的好评。
    这仅是一些片断的经验，离我们的要求还远，希望能抛砖引玉，再作磋商。（一九四六、六、一、于磁县司法科）
