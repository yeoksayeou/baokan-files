　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: The New Fourth Army seized Chiang's secret orders and other important documents during the self-defense campaign in the Taixing and Rugao areas last month, which revealed his conspiracy to attack and attempt to eliminate the New Fourth Army. A summary report is as follows:
    Secret order for attacking Huangqiao, Jiangyan, and Hai'an: First, Tang Enbo, Commander of the Pacification Zone, Operation Order No. 2162 at 14:00 on July 6th, excerpt: (Top Secret) (1) All armies in this zone should immediately assemble their forces...launch an attack to annihilate them and respond to the friendly forces operating in the Tianchang and Xuyi areas. (2) A portion of the 100th Army should secure key points at the Taixing port, with the main force assembling in the eastern area of Taixian before the 9th of this month... A portion of Taixing should assist the 99th Army in capturing Huangqiao, with the main force launching an eastward assault from Taixing, capturing Jiangyan and Qutang within a week, and potentially seizing Hai'an by taking advantage of the victory.
    Order to the newly formed 49th Division (formerly the 49th Army) for attacking Rugao: "(1) Omitted. (2) The two battalions of the 78th Regiment of the 12th Brigade, as the right column of the division, should assemble near Baibu Town before tomorrow (14th), complete preparations for the attack, and advance north along the Tongru Highway at dawn on the 15th... After occupying Dingyan, Songjiaqiao, and Gaochangtai, prepare for subsequent attacks. (3) The 79th Brigade, as the left column of the division, should assemble near Yaojiayuan and Yangjiayuan before July 14th, complete preparations for the attack, and advance north along the Tongru Highway at dawn on July 15th, occupying the Dengjiaqiao and Nanmatang lines, and prepare for subsequent attacks. (4) The 105th Brigade should dispatch one battalion each to defend Xiaohai in Haimen, and one battalion to take over the defenses of Tangjiazhai, Pingchao, and Tianshenggang on July 14th, with the main force assembling in Nantong to consolidate the defenses of Nantong City and advance on Xingren Town... (5) The first battalion of the 782nd Brigade, as the right reserve force, should assemble in Baibu Town before July 14th, and then follow the actions of the Li unit."

    Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Frontline, 9th: Zhang Yisheng, a major propaganda and education officer of the political department of the 187th Division of the 65th Army of the Chiang army, which was heading to Jingjiang to participate in the attack on the Suwan liberated area, defected to the liberated area of his own accord because he was tired of the civil war. According to Zhang, the 65th Army belonged to Yu Hanmou's system in Guangdong and had long been discriminated against and divided by the Kuomintang authorities, receiving only "partial equipment" (the Chiang army treated its direct and indirect lines differently with full equipment, half equipment, and partial equipment). After being transferred to Ganzhou under the guise of reorganization, they continued to head north. Many officers and soldiers deserted along the way after hearing the news of the civil war. The 580th Regiment alone had sixty or seventy deserters. When they marched north from Wujin to Jingjiang on the 12th of last month, Kuang Guangpei, the political instructor of the 7th Company of the regiment, and Xu Jinji, the political instructor of the company of the 59th Regiment, also ran away. The mid-level officers of the 65th Army had realized that the combat effectiveness of the New Fourth Army should not be underestimated; the lower-level officers were even more depressed and only worried about how to save their lives in the civil war. Zhang had long been disgusted with the civil war but had no opportunity to escape. When the army arrived in Jingjiang, he heard that the countryside was under the jurisdiction of the New Fourth Army, so he resolutely came to the liberated area he had long yearned for. Zhang said that after coming to the liberated area, everything he saw was peaceful and free, completely consistent with what he had seen in progressive pictorials, which made him extremely gratified. In the future, he is willing to participate in the construction work that is beneficial to the people in the liberated area.

    【新华社苏中前线九日电】上月十三日，开往靖江参加进攻苏皖解放区的蒋军六十五军一八七师政治部少校宣教干事张易生氏，因厌弃内战自动投奔解放区。据张氏谈：六十五军属广东余汉谋系统，久受国民党当局岐视分化，仅给予“部分配备”（蒋军按嫡系与非嫡系分全配备、半配备和部分配备三种不同待遇）。用整编名义调到赣州后继续北开，官兵听到内战消息后沿途逃亡者甚众，仅五八零团一团就有六七十个开了小差。上月十二日由武进北开靖江时，该团七连指导员邝光培、五九团连指导员许金基也逃跑了，六十五军的中级官佐已认识了新四军战斗力不可轻视；下级官佐更感苦闷，只担心如何在内战中保存一条性命。张氏早已厌恶内战，但苦无法脱离机会，当该军开抵靖江后，听说乡下都是新四军管辖范围，他便毅然来到了他向往已久的解放区。张氏表示来解放区后，所见一切和平自由景象与平日从进步画报中所见者完全一致，极感欣慰。今后愿在解放区参加有益人民的建设工作。
