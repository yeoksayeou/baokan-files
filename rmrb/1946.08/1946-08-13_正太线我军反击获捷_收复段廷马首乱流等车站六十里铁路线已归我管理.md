　　【This dispatch from our newspaper’s Changzhi office on the 7th】The Yan Xishan-puppet troops along the Zhengtai Railway line have recently coordinated with the Yan Xishan troops on the Datong-Puzhou Railway line to invade our liberated areas of Shouyang and Pingding. Our Eighth Route Army, having endured to the point of intolerability, launched a heroic counterattack on the 4th, successively recovering stations on the Zhengtai Railway in Shouyang, including Shanghu, Mashou, and Duanting. The Baiyangshe station (under the jurisdiction of Pingding) west of Niangziguan was also liberated. The stubborn puppet troops were completely disarmed, and the victories are continuing to expand.
　　【This dispatch from our newspaper’s Changzhi office on the 10th】Our army, conducting a self-defense counterattack along the Zhengtai Railway line, continued to recover stations such as Lujiazhuang, Ranliu, and Qinquan, as well as areas like Zhangjingzhen, on the 8th, and also captured the important stronghold of Longhua Mountain south of Shouyang. By this point, sixty miles of the Zhengtai Railway line were completely under the management of our democratic government. The 213th Regiment of the 71st Division of Yan Xishan's army and the puppet Yang Cheng's troops, entrenched in the area, fled to Yuci in a panic on the night of the 7th. In this battle, over 200 puppet soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured, and nine light machine guns, three small cannons, over a hundred rifles, and sixteen telephones were seized. These places recovered by our army along the Zhengtai Railway line this time were all liberated by our army from the enemy and puppet forces during the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Lishi, 10th】Jucheng Town (20 li northeast of Fenyang), an important location on the Pingchuan Fen (Yang)-Wen (Shui) Highway in central Shanxi, and villages such as Mujiazhuang, Xigucun, and Dongcundui east of Qingyuan (all 10 to 25 li southeast of Qingyuan) were successively recovered by the Luliang Eighth Route Army on the 1st of this month and the 28th of last month. A part of the 209th Regiment of the 70th Division of Yan Xishan's army, numbering over 200 men, was annihilated. The aforementioned villages and towns, as well as the vast areas of the Pingchuan region in central Shanxi, were illegally occupied by Yan Xishan's army in early June.
　　【This dispatch from our newspaper’s Heze office on the 7th】The 85th Army of the Kuomintang in northern Henan has recently been concentrating in the Liyuantun area east of the Pinghan Railway in Jixian County. The puppet Provisional 4th Column of Sun Dianying's troops has also been transferred north from Xinxiang to Tangyin, preparing to coordinate from the north and south to attack Daokou City in Hua County, Jilu Yu. On the 1st, three Kuomintang reconnaissance planes also flew to Daokou to conduct reconnaissance, leading to a tense situation east of the road.
