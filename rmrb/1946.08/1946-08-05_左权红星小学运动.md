　　Zuoquan Red Star Primary School Movement

　　(I) The Proposal of the Movement

　　Last May, during the county's training of teachers, it was discovered that the teachers had many opinions regarding the leadership, such as feeling like they were "without a wife" and that "being a teacher has no future." Coupled with the developing situation of cadres being transferred elsewhere, this further destabilized the teachers' emotions. In light of this situation, in addition to organizing the teachers to examine the leadership and exchange experiences, the leadership immediately called on everyone to settle down and work, serving the masses' cultural and educational endeavors, and resoundingly proposed launching the county-wide Red Star Primary School (i.e., model primary school) movement. The standards at the time were: 1. Strive for an enrollment rate of 80% of children both inside and outside the school. 2. Closely integrate with society, production, family, and war. 3. Create experiences and exchange experiences. The leadership clearly announced that whoever achieved these standards would be a model; teachers who became Red Star Primary School teachers would receive a merit citation.

　　The majority of teachers expressed enthusiastic support for this movement. It encouraged a new heroism among the teachers, stabilized their wavering emotions, and every teacher was swept up in the Red Star Primary School movement.

　　(II) The Teachers' Determination

　　After the meeting, the teachers had great enthusiasm, but the masses' understanding of the school still had a distance to go. At this time, the teachers held parent-teacher conferences to conduct ideological mobilization, ensuring that children would learn skills and periodically inviting parents to the school for face-to-face examinations, initially smoothing out the masses' thinking. Another difficulty was that the busy farming season affected children's enrollment. At this time, the teachers tried their best to combine learning with production. For example, they mobilized children to work with mutual aid teams, organizing children to contract work, exchange labor, and cut firewood. Because the teachers actively came up with solutions, the number of students in each school surged, which gave the teachers even more enthusiasm and allowed them to display creativity, laying a preliminary foundation for the development of cultural and educational work in Zuoquan.

　　(III) The Key to the Movement

　　During the Mid-Autumn Festival, each school held an achievement exhibition and a forum for parents, reporting on the school's work and allowing parents to see their children's achievements firsthand. At the meeting, they proposed an educational policy of "learn whatever you want to learn, teach whatever you want to be taught." Many people who visited the exhibition understood that the students' achievements were the result of the teachers' hard work, and at the forum, they all reflected on how their past assistance to the teachers had been insufficient, and that they would pay attention in the future. Some villages even automatically raised the teachers' salaries by one level, and some were even willing to sell land to let their children study.

　　At the same time, the leadership launched a county-wide movement to support teachers. Each village sent many fruits, mooncakes, and other gifts to the teachers, which greatly encouraged the teachers' morale. Some "sojourner teachers" who wanted to leave the education profession also settled down to work.

　　After the exhibition, the parent-teacher conference, and the movement to support teachers, the Red Star Primary School movement was universally launched, penetrating into every village, child, and mass.

　　(IV) Preliminary Selection

　　After the Mid-Autumn Festival's movement to support teachers, the goals of stabilizing teachers' emotions and developing cultural and educational work had been initially achieved. In October, a county-wide primary school teacher conference was held to conduct a preliminary selection of Red Star Primary Schools, exchange experiences, and study experiences. At this time, in addition to the nineteen candidate Red Star Primary Schools selected by the administrative district, there were also three primary schools that voluntarily participated in the election, and the leadership also encouraged this spirit. After democratic discussion, the ten Red Star Primary Schools of Pan'nao, Tongtan, Jianmiao, Xiazhuang, Donghuangzhang, Sipingqian, Shilidian, Shangzhuang, and Liangyu were finally selected through anonymous voting combined with the discussion of the evaluation committee. All teachers and principals of the Red Star Primary Schools were given a merit citation by the county government, and these ten primary schools were named the first batch of Red Star Primary Schools in ×× village. This spirit of doing what was said established the leadership's prestige; this practice of timely summarizing and studying experiences enlightened the teachers' work direction. At the same time, after research, the standards of the Red Star Primary School were raised again, calling on everyone to continue their efforts to conduct a re-election in the county during the April 4th Children's Day this year. The standards are: 1. Regular enrollment of 80% of children, with significant achievements in organizing out-of-school children and teaching management. 2. Good implementation of the new education policy and integration with all aspects. 3. Integration with social education, enabling winter schools and primary schools to promote each other. 4. Close relationship between teachers and the masses (including cadres) in educating the masses.

　　After this preliminary selection, various types of model villages were established. For example, Pan'nao is a dispersed village with more than two hundred households in thirteen small mountain villages scattered over forty-five miles, with distances of more than ten miles between them. Tongtan, Siping, and Xiazhuang are larger towns with enrollment rates of over 85%. Shilidian was just liberated from the enemy's iron hooves. Qiancun is a typical example of a model winter school transformed into a private primary school. Jianmiao crawled out of the famine, achieving a situation where only one of the village's thirty-nine children was out of school. Donghuangzhang and Liangyu are representatives of general villages. The villages that were selected as Red Star Primary Schools all held victory celebrations. The teachers' morale was raised, and the masses' morale was also high. The Red Star Primary School movement was widely and deeply developed throughout the county.

　　Because there were new goals to strive for, significant achievements were made in integrating with social education and mass relations during the winter and around the Spring Festival. For example, the characters on the literacy boards in Shilidian were the same as the farmers' literacy lessons, allowing students to go home and teach adults, achieving mutual promotion between winter schools and primary schools. During the busy spring season, Lianbi organized children to deliver manure, help the village deliver letters, and carry water for the families of soldiers to sow seeds, which was supported by the masses and aroused the concern of cadres and the masses for the school.

　　Because there were achievements that the masses could see and things were truly done for the masses, the masses actively took action to pay attention to and care about the school. This spring, 80% of the villages in Zuoquan repaired classrooms. Labor hero Liu Xirong of Matian and political commissar Ma of the Fourth District actively promoted the establishment of private complete primary schools. New shops, Xiazhuang, and other places, under the active promotion of district chiefs, political commissars, village cadres, and the masses, developed three private senior classes. This shows that the masses recognize the benefits of "the school is their own and should be run by themselves." This is a concrete manifestation of the masses' demand to be liberated culturally after being economically and politically liberated, and it is also the achievement of half a year of the Red Star Primary School movement.

　　(V) A Victorious Summary

　　To coincide with this year's "April 4th" Children's Day, the county loudly proposed the "Love Children" movement, mobilizing teachers and parents to care for children, especially helping poor children solve difficulties such as books, stationery, and clothing. This call was immediately met with enthusiastic response. Some donated money, some donated grain, some shops and cooperatives offered large discounts for children for three days, and some teachers even donated foreign currency to have a feast for the children. This raised the social status and learning enthusiasm of children, making the relationship between children and teachers, the masses, and the school closer, and pushing the county's education work a step further.

　　As the county was about to summarize the Red Star Primary School, it used great efforts to prepare for the cultural and educational conference, creating public opinion throughout the county, so that everyone paid attention to summarizing the work of the Red Star Primary School. Therefore, when the county cultural and educational conference was held on June 1st, as soon as you entered Zuoquan, if you asked any of the masses, they would all know that the county was holding a cultural and educational conference.

　　During the meeting, County Chief Huang and the Minister of Propaganda of the County Party Committee personally participated in the group and presided over the entire process of the conference. After listening to the reports of the model teachers and the opinions of the representatives of the Red Star Primary Schools, the presidium and the education assistant jointly selected nineteen Red Star Primary Schools. The first prize included Qiancun, Xiazhuang, Jianmiao, and Pan'nao; the second prize included Shilidian, Tongtan, Xiguan, Lianbi, Zhuangshang, Xihetou, Donghuangzhang, Siping, and Shangwu; the third prize included Matian, Baiyu, Hanwang, Majiu, Changcheng, and Sucheng. All first and second prize primary schools were given a beautifully crafted wooden plaque by the county's cultural and educational conference, with the inscription "Presented to ×× Village Red Star Primary School." From then on, the masses saw the importance of education work. At this point, the Red Star Primary School movement, which had been developing for a year, came to an end.

　　In order to consolidate existing achievements and bring the Red Star Primary School movement into a new stage of improvement and balance, after everyone's brewing and discussion, new standards were formulated: (1) Organize more than 90% of children to attend school, and make significant achievements for children outside the school. (2) Achieve mass self-management and mass management, establish school housekeeping, and reduce the burden on the people. (3) Implement democratic management methods, closely connect teacher-student relationships, cultivate activists, and transform naughty children. (4) Create experiences, spread experiences, and assist nearby primary schools in balanced development. (5) The school is closely integrated with social education, promoting each other.

　　(VI) A Few Experiences

　　The Zuoquan Red Star Primary School movement was a victory, and the main reason was the leadership's responsibility and implementation of the spirit. The leaders attached importance to this work ideologically, placing it in a primary position, issuing timely calls (supporting teachers, exhibitions, loving children), clearly putting forward goals, and conducting timely inspections and summaries. Through the work of each period, the Red Star Primary School movement penetrated into every teacher, every child, and every mass and cadre. Moreover, the leadership was able to correctly inspire the teachers' new heroism, so that primary school education in the past year made significant achievements, and the teachers' dedication was developed. On this basis, the enthusiasm of the masses to run schools themselves was inspired, and some budding but very valuable experiences in mass self-run schools were created. And able to run schools according to the opinions of the masses, implement the new education policy of "what to learn and what to do."

　　After the Red Star Primary School movement, education work has made new progress and promoted the cultural and educational work of the entire county.

### 左权红星小学运动

　　左权红星小学运动
    （一）运动的提出
    去年五月县里集训教员时，发现教员们对领导上有许多意见，如认为自己是“没媳孩”，“当教员没有前途”等。加之形势发展干部纷纷外调，更使教员情绪动荡。根据这种情况，领导上除组织教员们对领导进行检查交流经验外，随即号召大家安心工作，为群众文教工作服务，响亮提出开展全县范围的红星小学（即模范小学）运动。当时的标准是：一、争取校内外百分之八十儿童就学。二、和社会、生产、家庭、战争密切结合。三、创造经验交流经验。领导上明确的宣布，谁争取到这个标准就是模范；成为红星小学的教员，一律记功一次。
    对于这一运动，大部份教员表示热烈响应。它鼓励了教员的新英雄主义，安定了教员的动荡情绪，每个教员都卷入红星小学运动的浪潮里。
    （二）教员的决心
    会议后，教员劲头很大，但群众对学校的认识还有一个距离。这时教员们召开家长会进行思想动员，保证儿童学会本事，定期请家长来校当面考试，初步疏通了群众思想。另一个困难是农忙时节影响儿童入学。这时教员们想尽办法，使学习与生产结合。如动员儿童与互助组结合，组织儿童包工、换工、割柴等。由于教员们积极想办法，各校学生激增，因之，教员劲头更大，且能发挥创造性，初步打下了开展左权文教工作的基础。
    （三）运动的关键
    中秋节，各校举行了成绩展览会，和家长座谈会，报告学校工作，使家长们亲眼看到自己子女的成绩，且在会上提出想怎念就怎念，要学啥就教啥的教育方针。许多群众参观展览会都知道学生的成绩是教员们努力辛苦得来的，且在座谈会上都检讨过去对教员的帮助不够，今后要注意，且有些村自动把教员的待遇提高一级，有的还愿卖地让孩子念书。
    同时领导上发动了全县的拥师运动，各村给教员送了许多水果、月饼等礼物，对教员情绪鼓舞很大，有些想脱离教育工作的“作客教员”，也安心了工作。
    经过展览会，家长会和拥师运动，红星小学运动普遍开展起来，它深入到每个村庄的儿童和群众中。
    （四）初选
    经过中秋节的拥师运动，已初步达到安定教员情绪与开展文教工作的目的。十月间召开全县小学教员会议，进行红星小学初选，彼此交流经验，研究经验。这时除由行政区选出的十九个候选红星小学外，还有三个小学自动参加竞选，领导上也鼓励了这种精神。经过民主讨论，最后以不记名投票配合评委会的讨论，选出了盘垴、桐滩、尖庙、下庄、东黄漳、寺坪前＠、十里店、上庄、梁峪十个红星小学。凡是红星小学的教员与校长，由县府各记功一次，并将这十个小学命名为××村初选红星小学。这种说到做到的精神，树立了领导上的威信；这种及时总结和研究经验的作法，启示了教员的工作方向。同时经过研究，又提高了红星小学的标准，号召大家继续努力，于今年四四节在县进行复选，其标准是：一、经常有百分之八十儿童入学，适当的组织校外儿童，教学管理上有显著成绩者。二、贯彻新教育方针，与各方面结合的好者。三、与社会教育结合，能使冬学与小学相互影响下共同推进者。四、在教育群众中，教员与群众（包括干部）关系密切者。
    经过这次初选，树立了各种类型的模范村，如盘垴，是一个周围四十五里，相距十余里，十三个小山庄共二百余户的分散村庄；桐滩、寺坪、下庄系较大村镇，入学儿童均在百分之八十五以上；十里店为刚从敌人铁蹄下解放出来的；前＠村为模范冬学转成民办小学的典型；尖庙是从灾荒中爬出来，做到全村三十九个儿童，只有一人失学的村子；东黄漳和梁峪为一般村的代表。当选红星小学的村庄，都召开了祝捷大会，教员情绪提高了，群众情绪也高了，红星小学运动便在全县范围内广泛深入的开展起来。
    因为有了新的奋斗目标，在冬季和年关前后对结合社会教育及群众关系上，就做出了显著成绩。如十里店识字牌上的字与农民的识字课相同，让学生回家教大人，做到了冬学与小学互相推进；连壁在春忙时，组织儿童送粪，帮村上送信，给抗属抬水下种等，得到群众拥护，引起了干部与群众对学校的关心。
    因为有了群众看得见的成绩，又真正为群众办了事情，群众就积极行动起来，注意和关心学校，今春左权有百分之八十的村子修教室。麻田劳动英雄刘锡荣和四区马政委积极推动民办完小的成立；新店、下庄等都在区长政委村干部和群众的积极推动下，发展了三个民办高级班。这说明群众认识到了“学校是自己的，应该自己来办”的好处。这是群众在经济上政治上翻身后，又要求在文化上翻身的具体表现，也是半年红星小学运动的成绩。
    （五）胜利的总结
    配合今年“四四”儿童节，县里又响亮的提出“爱儿”运动，发动教员与家长爱护儿童，特别是帮助贫苦儿童解决书籍文具衣服等困难。这号召马上得到了热烈的响应，有的献钱，有的献粮，有的商店及合作社为儿童大减价三天，有的教员还捐洋为儿童会餐，这样提高了儿童的社会地位和学习情绪，使儿童与教员、群众与学校的关系更密切，把全县教育工作又推进了一步。
    快到总结全县红星小学时，县里用了很大力量准备文教大会，造成全县舆论，使大家都注意总结红星小学这一工作，所以在六月一日举行县文教大会时，一入左权境，随便问到一个群众，他都知道县里正开文教大会。
    在开会时，黄县长和县委宣传部长亲自参加小组，主持了大会的全部过程，听取了模范教员的报告与红星小学代表的意见后，主席团和教育助理员等共同评选了十九个红星小学。计一等有前＠、下庄、尖庙，盘垴；二等有十里店、桐滩、西关、连壁、庄上、西河头、东黄漳、寺坪、上武；三等有麻田、柏峪、寒王、马厩、长城、粟城。所有一二等小学，统由县文教大会名义，各赠给精制木匾一块，上书“赠给××村红星小学”。从此群众看到了教育工作的重要。至此，一年来发展的红星小学运动告一段落。
    为巩固已有成绩，使红星小学运动进入提高与平衡的新阶段，经过大家的酝酿讨论，又订出了新的标准：（一）组织百分之九十以上的儿童就学，对校外的儿童做出显著的成绩。（二）做到群众自办，群众管理，建立学校家务，减轻人民负担。（三）贯彻民主管理方式，密切师生关系，培养积极份子，改造顽皮儿童。（四）创造经验，传播经验，辅助附近的小学平衡发展。（五）学校与社会教育密切结合，互相推动。
    （六）几点经验
    左权红星小学运动胜利了，其主要原因是由于领导上的负责和贯彻精神。领导者在思想上重视了这一工作，把这个工作放在首要的位置，适时提出号召（拥师、展览、爱儿），明确提出奋斗目标，及时进行检查与总结，通过各个时期的工作，使红星小学运动深入到每个教员每个儿童以后每个群众与干部中去。且领导上能正确的启发教员们的新英雄主义，使一年来的小学教育有了显著的成绩，教员们的事业精神得到了发扬。在这样的基础上，启发了群众自己办学的积极性，且创造了一些萌芽的却十分宝贵的群众自办学校的经验。而且能够根据群众意见办学校，实行“要学啥就做啥”的新教育方针。
    经过红星小学运动，教育工作有了新的开展，且推动了全县的文教工作。
