　　Kuomintang Opens the Door to Robbers, American Goods Flood the Market
    Wu'an Merchants Advocate Self-Reliance with Local Goods
    Chiang Kai-shek's Puppets Manufacture Fake Hebei Currency to Disrupt Our Area's Finances
    [Our Newspaper Reports] The Kuomintang reactionaries have opened the door to robbers, and American goods are flooding major markets in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The entire national economy faces a total collapse. Merchants in the liberated areas, recognizing this situation, have launched a movement to advocate the use of local goods for self-reliance. In Wu'an city, 24 streets, and across more than 2,700 large and small businesses and vendors in the eight major towns and villages of the county, as well as citizens in the city, are launching a patriotic campaign to buy and sell domestic goods with high patriotic enthusiasm. Under the leadership of the Commercial Association, merchants gathered to discuss how to purify the market, strengthen the exchange of various products from the liberated areas, and restrict the import of foreign goods. They unanimously resolved to establish a Foreign Goods Registration Committee to register existing foreign goods on the market and set a deadline for their sale. Any unsold goods after August 15th will be centrally sold. In the future, they guarantee they will never smuggle in prohibited foreign goods. The government sympathizes with the patriotic enthusiasm of the merchants and firmly supports and approves it, guaranteeing to provide merchants with various conveniences to increase their profits. Currently, shops are enthusiastically registering. On July 29th and 30th alone, more than 340 businesses, including silk shops, porcelain shops, foreign cloth shops, and various cosmetics shops, registered. Many shops are planning to change their business. The silk shop on Nanguan Street will be reorganized into a small textile factory, purchasing various cotton gins, spinning machines, weaving machines, and sock knitting machines. Other foreign porcelain shops will switch to selling local porcelain, and luxury goods shops will switch to selling daily necessities and agricultural tools made of iron that are needed by the masses. This patriotic movement has now spread to major towns and villages such as Yangyi, Hecun, Jicheng, and Paihuai. Wu'an women, who used to be very particular about clothing, are now mostly wearing homespun cloth and not using cosmetics. The People's Education Center is also putting up blackboards on various streets and calling on the people of the city to oppose the dumping of American goods and use domestic goods on the radio.

    [Our Newspaper Reports] The Kuomintang reactionaries are plotting to disrupt our area's finances and undermine the credibility of the Hebei currency. Recently, they have printed a large number of counterfeit notes and dispatched special agents to infiltrate the markets in various parts of northern Henan. A large number of counterfeit notes printed by the puppet Wang Ziquan in Anyang have now been discovered, including five types: green-backed 1,000-yuan notes, 500-yuan notes, blue-backed 500-yuan notes, vertical 500-yuan notes, and Pingyuan blue-backed 500-yuan notes. The Third Branch of the Jinnan Bank has urgently instructed county branches to immediately organize a mass anti-counterfeit currency campaign. The Wu'an County Branch has specifically convened the Commercial Association to study how to identify counterfeit notes and will distribute notices, propaganda materials, and identification methods to various places. The county government plans to issue instructions to the militia in each district to strictly investigate special agents and unscrupulous merchants who carry counterfeit currency into our liberated areas, calling on the masses to defend the Hebei currency and formulate reward measures for catching them.
