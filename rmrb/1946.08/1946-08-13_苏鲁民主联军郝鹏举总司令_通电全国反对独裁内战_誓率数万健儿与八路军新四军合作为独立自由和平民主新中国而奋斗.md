　　Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 8th. Commander-in-Chief Hao Pengju of the Su Lu Democratic Allied Army recently sent a telegram to the entire country on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the army, opposing dictatorship and civil war, and supporting peace and democracy. The original telegram stated:

　　Chairman Chiang of Guling, Chairman Mao of Yan'an, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Mr. Feng Yuxiang of Guling, Gentlemen of the Democratic League, Commander Chen of Shandong:

　　Since Pengju and others revolted on the front line in Taierzhuang on January 9th of this year, opposing civil war and supporting democracy, we have telegraphed all sectors of the country, appealing for peace and the realization of democracy, and stopping civil war. Our loyalty is clear to heaven and earth! At a time when the Kuomintang reactionaries are relying on foreign forces to undermine peace and launch a large-scale civil war, we are determined to maintain our original intention and are willing to express our sincere words to all peace-loving and democratic military, civilian, business, and academic circles in the country: Pengju and others once belonged to the Northwest Army under Mr. Feng Yuxiang, and have always taken defending the country and loving the people as our duty. When the War of Resistance broke out, we led our troops into the Jin-Lu-Yu battlefield, bravely fought the enemy, risked our lives, repeatedly frustrated the enemy's advance, and advocated full-scale offensives to reverse the defeat. Who knew that this was contrary to the Kuomintang authorities' capitulationist policy of eliminating miscellaneous troops and destroying the CCP's military force "two wars at once," which angered those in power, and we almost faced death. Later, having survived by chance, we secretly entered the occupied areas, intending to kill the enemy. Unfortunately, we were captured by the enemy, incurring dishonor. However, our conscience was not extinguished, and our hot blood still remained. We endured humiliation, buried ourselves in building an army, thinking of taking the opportunity to avenge our shame and repay the country. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese surrender, we were unable to explain ourselves in time, and were then reorganized by the Kuomintang authorities into the Sixth Route Army, entered both sides of the Grand Canal, and were forced to attack the people's armed forces. Pengju and others, witnessing the peaceful and innocent soldiers and civilians who had already been brutally poisoned by the enemy, could not bear to deploy troops and engage in fratricidal strife again. Therefore, on January 9th, we refused the order to engage in civil war and supported peace and democracy in Taierzhuang. Since then, our army has become the people's armed force, and we follow the people's orders. We entered the liberated areas and have been training our troops for the past six months. Pengju and others only seek the hope of peace and democracy, and we will disarm and return to our fields, and be good citizens. This would be a great blessing. Who knew that the Kuomintang reactionaries would repeatedly tear up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, persecute democratic figures, suppress public opinion, and, with the support of foreign money and weapons, launch a large-scale civil war to massacre the people, attempting to realize their dream of dictatorship and autocracy, and plunging the motherland into a state of utter ruin! Violating laws and regulations, disregarding national disasters and the people's lives to such an extent! Today, Pengju and others should not only save the people from suffering, but also save the motherland from danger. We swear to lead tens of thousands of brave soldiers to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, as the backing of peace-loving and democratic people, and to fight for national independence and freedom, for peace and democracy, and for the establishment of a New Democratic China! We still remember that our military colleagues across the country, whether they are longtime comrades-in-arms or comrades who have shared hardships, although they are being held hostage and deceived by warmongers, there are still many heroes who love the country and cherish peace. We hope that they will jointly raise the banner of opposing civil war and supporting democracy, in order to save the century-long disaster and determine the fate of the motherland. Merits, sins, blessings, and misfortunes all depend on this one action! Urgent telegram, waiting with weapons at the ready!

　　Commander-in-Chief of the Su Lu Democratic Allied Army, Hao Pengju, and all officers and soldiers together kowtow.

　　August 8th

　　苏鲁民主联军郝鹏举总司令  
    通电全国反对独裁内战
    誓率数万健儿与八路军新四军合作为独立自由和平民主新中国而奋斗
    【新华社临沂八日电】苏鲁民主联军郝鹏举总司令率该军全体官兵顷通电全国，反对独裁内战，拥护和平民主，原电称：
    牯岭蒋主席、延安毛主席、朱总司令、牯岭冯玉祥先生、民主同盟诸先生、山东陈军长钧鉴：
    鹏举等自今年一月九日在台儿庄前线起义、反对内战拥护民主以来，曾电全国各界呼吁和平，实现民主，制止内战，赤胆忠心，可质天日！值此国民党反动派凭借外力、破坏和平、发动大规模内战之际，决一本初衷，愿为全国爱好和平民主之军民商学各界披沥陈词：溯鹏举等曾隶西北军冯玉祥先生麾下，素以卫国爱民为天职。迨抗战军兴，即统率所部进入晋鲁豫战场，英勇杀敌，出生入死，屡挫寇锋，并力主全力出击，挽回败局。孰知恰与国民党当局排除杂牌军队消灭中共武力“两次战争一次打”之投降政策相悖，致触怒权贵，几遭置于死地。后以虎口余生，潜人沦陷地区，计欲杀敌，不幸身为敌俘，致蒙不洁。然良心未灭，热血犹存，忍辱含垢，埋头建军，思有以乘机雪耻，报国于万一。不料日寇投降，表白不及，旋经国民党当局编为第六路军，开入运河两岸，强令向人民武装进攻。鹏举等目睹和平无辜军民已惨遭敌寇荼毒，何忍再陈兵列马，同室操戈，遂有一月九日在台儿庄拒绝内战乱命拥护和平民主之义举。此后本军即为人民之武力，唯人民之命是从，开入解放区。六阅月以来，即本此旨，整训部队。鹏举等惟求和平民主有望，即当解甲归田，得为良好公民，斯亦大幸矣。讵知国民党反动派一再撕毁政协决议，迫害民主人士，摧残舆论，又在外国金钱武器支持下，掀起大规模屠杀人民之内战，妄图实现独裁专制之迷梦，欲陷祖国于万劫不复之地！败法乱纪，不顾国难民命一至于此！时至今日，鹏举等不但应解人民于倒悬，亦且应救祖国于危难，誓率数万健儿，与八路军、新四军并肩合作，作和平民主人士之后盾，为民族独立自由、为和平民主、为建立新民主主义中国而奋斗！犹念我全国军界，或为多年战友，或为患难袍泽，虽受好战分子之挟持与欺蒙，但实不乏爱护祖国酷爱和平之英雄，尚希共举反对内战拥护民主之义旗，以冀挽百年之大难，决祖国之命运，功罪祸福，在此一举！临电迫切，枕戈以待！
    苏鲁民主联军总司令郝鹏举率全体官兵同叩
    八月八日
