　　[Report from this newspaper in Weixian] Responding to the call from the District Party Committee and Administrative Office to prepare for drought and famine, Guangzong and Xinhe are vigorously promoting production and thrift. In Guangzong's Fifth District, the villages of Hegu and Jiudian, among others, are actively engaged in production. According to reports, they have already leached 7,718 catties of salt, stored 320 carts of salt-rich soil, stored 191 loads of salt water, and added 10 new salt ponds. Women have earned 29,800 yuan from spinning and weaving. Recent rains have been thorough in each village, and they are actively rushing to plant red millet, rapeseed, yams, and radishes, as well as intensifying soil turning and hoeing the seedlings four times. Xinhe County held a meeting to discuss thrift and dispatched cadres to the countryside to help the masses make household plans. They called for collecting tree leaves and wild vegetables, adding more melons, fruits, beans, and the like to meals, and put forward thrift slogans such as "eat one less handful of rice a day," "a small stream flows steadily," and "go home for meals after going to the market." Each village also held "thinking meetings" to recall the famine of 1943. On the part of government cadres, they called for collecting firewood to save fuel, adding vegetables to meals, saving one or two taels of rice per day, not smoking cigarettes, and not eating in restaurants. Government organs have stipulated a system of storing bran and husks when milling rice and flour, and launched a signature campaign for cadres to save.
    [Report from this newspaper in Weixian] Due to continuous rains, the Wei River surged, and on the 26th, it suddenly breached the dike at Lizhuang, east of Linqing City, and the floodwaters flowed directly into Xiajin, threatening Wu cheng, Enxian, Pingyuan and Laoling with inundation. Commissioner Bei and Deputy Political Commissar Zhang personally led all cadres and the masses to the dike to rescue the situation day and night. The First and Second Special Districts are also mobilizing all forces to actively prevent and block the breaches. There are still eight dangerous sections near Linqing City. On the 26th, the dike near the electric light room suddenly overflowed, threatening the entire city with submersion. Thanks to the joint efforts of our Party, government, army, and people, along with the citizens of the entire city, disaster was fortunately averted. Currently, cadres and citizens are still building sheds on the dike, guarding it day and night. Some of the flood-stricken masses in Xiajin and other counties fled to the surrounding villages, while others were trapped on rooftops and trees. The Special District is requisitioning all ships to actively rescue the flood victims. Linqing City has also established refugee reception centers, providing extensive shelter and resettlement.
