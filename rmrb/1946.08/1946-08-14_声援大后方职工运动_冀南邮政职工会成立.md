　　Supporting the Labor Movement in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas
    Establishment of the Jinnan Postal Workers' Union
    [Our newspaper, Weixian News] The Jinnan Postal Workers' Union was officially established on July 26th. More than 40 representatives from various sub-districts and counties attended. In the three days before the meeting, proposals and streamlining issues were discussed. The workers unanimously expressed their gratitude for the democratic government's special care for workers' interests and for resolving various difficulties. Model workers were elected during the meeting, including Luo Runian and eight others. In order to build and develop the people's postal service, the meeting determined: (1) to consolidate and develop the organization, and strengthen member education; (2) to improve the quality of workers, launch the Luo Runian movement, promote Luo Runian's spirit of hard work, and ensure prompt delivery without losing a single piece of mail; to promote individual special creations and summarize experiences in a timely manner; (3) to develop business. Later, Director Wang gave a summary, emphasizing that with the support of the democratic government, the lives of workers have improved and their political status has been elevated. However, the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are still living the lives of slaves, worse than animals. He said: "We must use our work achievements to support the labor movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, oppose the civil war, and strive for peace." Secondly, he mentioned strengthening the unity of new and old postal workers. He said: "New postal workers should learn the skills of old postal workers, and old postal workers should learn the spirit of hard struggle of new postal workers." Finally, all the representatives unanimously decided to send a telegram to the whole country to support the labor movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, oppose the civil war, and strive for peace and the liberation of the workers. The meeting then came to a close.
