　　[This dispatch comes from Changzhi] The production movement in Chuandi Village, Pingshun, is currently developing in depth. After the village cadres and masses clarified their thinking on getting rich, they then discussed "how to get rich." The leadership summarized the typical example of Guo Yu'en's efforts to get rich through precise production planning, mobilized everyone to discuss it, and after clearing their minds, the villagers formulated prosperity plans from household to the entire village. Thus, the Chuandi production movement was launched in depth.

　　Guo Yu'en was originally very poor. He only bought four mu and eight fen of land during the rent reduction in 1942. In 1943, he harvested eleven shi of grain including hillside land, but after paying off his debts, he had only five shi left, which was not enough to eat. Yu'en responded to the government's call to organize for production in order to survive the famine. He first organized a mutual aid team, tried to survive the famine, worked actively, the whole group opened up eighteen mu of wasteland, fertilized each mu with one hundred dan of manure, and cultivated and weeded twice. Under the encouragement of his group, the whole village was organized. Yu'en opened up five mu of wasteland through mutual aid, and harvested eighteen shi of grain in 1944, which was enough to eat. In 1945, he paid special attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation, harvesting twenty-eight shi of grain, and achieved "cultivate two, reserve one." In these two years, he was selected as the second-ranked labor hero in the entire county. This year, in agriculture, he is implementing warm water seed soaking, fertilizing each mu with 101 dan of manure (and applying top dressing to two mu), plowing, harrowing, and weeding three times each, planted one mu of cotton and two and a half mu of Golden Queen corn. He plans to harvest thirty shi of grain, and after eating, have half left over. In sideline occupations, he wants to weave cloth for clothing self-sufficiency, plant five mu of medicinal materials, seven mu of tree seedlings, extensively raise cattle, pigs, chickens, and sheep, invest two thousand yuan in cooperative shares, and plans to buy a weaving machine. Yu'en became rich gradually through rent reduction and organized production, and through household planning. He himself became rich, and he tried his best to help the poor, winning the support of the entire village.

　　The leadership helped Yu'en summarize his prosperity plan and methods, invited him to report at the people's school, and widely publicized and discussed it among the masses. People said: "Yu'en is the best off in our village. He responded to the government's call, organized mutual aid, and became successful through deep plowing and careful cultivation." "The old saying goes: eating doesn't make you poor, dressing doesn't make you poor, but without planning, you'll be poor for life. Yu'en's planning is good, he has plans every year, but we do whatever comes our way, we don't prepare early, and we delay everything." Finally, it was unanimously agreed that: to get rich, we must think of various ways to produce.

　　When the masses had the need to accurately calculate their own family affairs, the cadres then specifically divided the work, determined the targets, and helped everyone to order them separately. Every household in the village made their plans, and the production direction of the entire village was also clarified. The village cadres then checked the village plan made in the first month according to these plans, looked at what had been done and what had not been done in agriculture, sideline occupations, and all aspects, and what were the reasons? Mobilized all households in the village to discuss how to ensure "cultivate two, reserve one." Finally, with reference to the plans of each household, the village's plan was revised and reordered: in agriculture: 3,245 mu of hillside land, which can produce 1,000 bags of potatoes, 48,000 jin of vegetables, and 67 shi and 3 dou of miscellaneous grains; 683 mu of flat land, which can produce 1,475 shi and 6 dou of grain and 480 jin of cotton after top dressing. In sideline occupations, raising chickens can produce more than 24,000 eggs, raising silkworms can produce 18 jin of cocoons, spinning 1,495 jin of yarn, weaving 800 jin of cloth, plus beekeeping, weaving straw hats, mountain goods, and cooperative income can earn a total of 464,985 yuan. Including agricultural income, it is equivalent to 2,333 shi and 7 dou of grain (large dou). The village has 344 people, large and small, and needs a total of 1,559 shi of grain for food, clothing, expenses, public grain, public funds, and livestock feed. After deducting expenses, there is a net surplus of 774 shi and 8 dou. Together with the surplus grain next year, "cultivate two, reserve one" can be achieved.

　　After revising the plan, the masses' production enthusiasm was extremely high, and they unanimously wanted to fight for "cultivate two, reserve one." The mutual aid teams challenged each other, and after discussion by the masses, four conditions were created for Chuandi to be a model village: 1. Guarantee that the village plan is at least 80% completed. 2. Organize comprehensively, carry out comprehensive production, exceeding any previous year. 3. Focus on agriculture and concurrently engage in handicrafts, extract all surplus labor, and implement it throughout the year. 4. Help poor peasants get rich, so that every household has enough to eat and wear. The whole village is now striving for this goal of "cultivate two, reserve one."

　　平顺川底村争取耕二余一
    精确计划发家致富
    各互助组展开竞赛争取创造模范村
    【本报长治讯】平顺川底村的生产运动，现正深入发展中。该村干部及群众明确了发家思想后，接着讨论“怎样发家”，领导上总结了郭玉恩按照精确生产计划努力生产发家致富的典型，发动大家讨论，打通思想后，由户到全村制定发家计划，川底生产运动遂深入开展起来。
    郭玉恩本来很穷，四二年减租时才买了四亩八分地，四三年连坡地共收了十一石粮食，还了债剩下五石还不够吃。玉恩响应政府组织起来生产的号召，首先组织了个互助组，设法渡荒，积极劳动，全组开了十八亩荒地，每亩上粪一百担，并作到耕二锄二。在他这个组的鼓动下，全村都组织起来了。玉恩由于互助开了五亩荒地，四四年收粮十八石，已经够吃。四五年特别注意深耕细作，收粮二十八石，作到了耕二余一。在这两年中被选为全县劳动英雄第二名。他今年在农业上实行温汤浸种，每亩上粪一○一担（并上二亩追肥），耙犁锄各三遍，种了一亩棉花二亩半金皇后，计划收粮三十石，除了吃可剩一半。副业上要纺织穿衣自给，种五亩药材，七亩树秧，广养牛、猪、鸡、羊，入两千元合作社股，并计划买一架织布机。玉恩是经过减租和组织起来生产，并经过按家计划逐步富裕了的。他自己富了，并且尽力帮助穷人，深得全村拥护。
    领导上帮助玉恩把他的发家计划及发家办法总结出来，请他在民校报告，并在群众中广泛宣传讨论。人们都说：“咱村数玉恩过的好，他是响应政府号召，组织互助，深耕细作闹好了的。”“古话说：吃不穷穿不穷，打算不到一辈穷。人家玉恩打算的好，年年有计划，咱是碰到甚作甚，不早准备，把事情都耽误了。”最后一致认为：要想富必须想各种方法生产才行。
    群众有了精确计算自己家务的要求，干部于是具体分工，确定对象，分别帮助大家去订。村里每一户都订出来了，全村的生产方向也明确了。村干部又根据这些计划检查正月间订出的全村计划，从农业、副业、各方面看那样作到了，那样没有作到，原因是什么？发动全村各户讨论，怎样保证耕二余一。最后参照各户的计划修改重订了全村的计划：要作到农业上：坡地三千二百四十五亩，可收山药蛋一千袋，菜四万八千斤，杂粮六十七石三斗，平地六百八十三亩，上追肥后可收粮食一千四百七十五石六斗及棉花四百八十斤。副业上养鸡下蛋二万四千多个，养蚕收茧十八斤，纺线一千四百九十五斤，织布八百斤，再加上养蜂、编草帽、山货、合作社收入共可赚四十六万四千九百八十五元。连上农业收入共折粮食二千三百三十三石七斗（大斗）。全村大小三百四十四口，吃穿零用、公粮公款，连上牲畜饲料共需粮食一千五百五十九石，除去开支净余七百七十四石八斗，加上明年余粮可得耕二余一。
    修改了计划，群众生产情绪极高，一致要为耕二余一而奋斗。各互助组间纷纷挑战，并经群众讨论创造川底为模范村的四个条件：一、保证全村计划至少完成百分之八十。二、全面组织起来，进行全面生产，超过已往任何一年。三、以农业为主兼营手工业，抽出所有剩余劳力，贯彻全年。四、帮助贫农发家，作到户户够吃够穿。现全村都在为这个耕二余一的目标而奋斗。
