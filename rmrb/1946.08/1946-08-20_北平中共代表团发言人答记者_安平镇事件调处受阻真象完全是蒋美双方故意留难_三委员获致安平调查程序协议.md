　　Spokesperson of the Beiping CCP Delegation Answers Reporters
    Truth of Obstructed Mediation of Anping Town Incident is Entirely Intentional Obstruction by Both Jiang and U.S. Sides
    Three Commissioners Reach Agreement on Anping Investigation Procedures
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 14th] (Delayed) Our agency’s special correspondent visited the spokesperson of the Beiping CCP Delegation on the morning of the 12th to inquire about the truth behind the failure of Special Group 25 to carry out its work smoothly after the Anping incident. The questions and answers are as follows: Question: When was Special Group 25 formed? Answer: After the Anping incident on July 29, the CCP immediately proposed to the U.S. side to send a group to investigate. The decision to send a group was made on August 1. Question: If the group was dispatched on the 1st, why did it not start working until the 5th? Answer: According to the practice of the Executive Headquarters, the group should be convened by the U.S. chairman. The U.S. representative of Group 25 did not notify until the 3rd, and a meeting was scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on the 4th. However, when the meeting convened on the 4th, the U.S. representative Davis again refused to hold the meeting, citing being busy collecting materials. Question: When did the group start working? Answer: It started on the morning of the 5th. However, in the afternoon of that day, the government representative Wu Dingneng suddenly opposed the participation of the CCP representative, Major General Huang Yifeng, in the group due to the issue of representative qualifications, resulting in no results from that day’s meeting. Question: What was the progress of the work in the following days? Answer: On the 6th and 7th, due to the U.S. representative's attempt to force the group to listen solely to the reports of personnel designated by the U.S. side and refusal of the CCP representative's proposal to determine work procedures, the work was fruitless for several days. Question: Did the group go out for inspection? Answer: The three commissioners originally scheduled the group to depart on the morning of the 8th, but the U.S. representative suddenly wanted to limit the number of group members, saying that each group should not exceed three people. After the CCP representative refuted this with reason, Davis threatened by not providing vehicles, and at the same time insisted on checking the identity cards of the CCP members, which delayed the departure until 2:00 p.m. Question: What was the situation during the Anping inspection? Answer: The terrain of Anping is a flat plain, all open ground. An ambush during the day is absolutely impossible, and the so-called engineering obstacles are all fabricated. What can be proven is that the government army occupied the area after coordinating with the U.S. military in the attack on July 29. The situation in the area has changed, and the people are unable to freely express the actual military situation under the threat of the Kuomintang army. Question: Have you contacted the local CCP military headquarters? Answer: The government representative firmly opposed going to the CCP area, so it could not be achieved. The liaison officer designated by the CCP has not been able to depart until now because the government refused to guarantee safety. General Xiao Ke has again telegraphed the group to go, because the commander there has been waiting for nine days. Question: Why has the procedural issue become the focus of the dispute? Answer: The Kuomintang and the U.S. sides attempted to only allow the group to listen to reports from the U.S. Marine Corps and witnesses designated by the U.S. side, and were not prepared to investigate in the CCP area. They also used the excuse of not guaranteeing safety to prevent CCP personnel from coming to Beiping, and then have a "judgment in absentia" by the Jiang and U.S. sides, and publish a one-sided report. Therefore, they refused to have procedures, while the CCP believed that there must be procedures, and that the execution of procedures should be guaranteed in order to have the opportunity to explain the true facts. Question: Is it true that the CCP is delaying the investigation? Answer: Anping has now been occupied by the Kuomintang army, and the conflict in Xianghe is expanding day by day, while the Jiang and U.S. sides are making absurd propaganda, causing some people to be unclear about the truth. Therefore, our side is more eager than the Jiang and U.S. sides to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to get to the bottom of the matter.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Regarding the Anping group investigation procedures, the three commissioners of the Executive Headquarters reached the following agreement yesterday: (1) Questioning and recording the testimonies of U.S. witnesses Major Fretz and two others, who were personnel of the Executive Headquarters traveling in vehicles of a transportation convoy escorted by an armed patrol of the U.S. Marine Corps. (2) Questioning and recording the testimonies of U.S. Marine Corps Captain Belcher and U.S. Marine Corps personnel who participated in the conflict. (3) Visiting, questioning, and recording the testimonies of CCP military commanders and soldiers who participated in the conflict. (4) Inspecting the conflict area and visiting and recording the testimonies of other witnesses. (5) Questioning and recording the testimonies of Lieutenant General Locke, commander of the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Marine Corps in Tianjin, General Sun Lianzhong, commander of the 11th War Zone, and senior CCP military commanders in the area where the incident occurred. (6) Questioning and recording the testimonies of other witnesses deemed necessary by each party to ascertain the truth of the incident. (7) Visiting, questioning, and recording whether the Kuomintang troops claimed by the CCP to have participated in the conflict are facts recognized by the government and the U.S. Marine Corps. (8) Convening group meetings to prepare a report to be submitted to the three commissioners. The chairman of the group meetings will be rotated among the three parties. It is further agreed that there should be no distinction between the various types of witnesses. Regardless of whether they were in the area during the conflict, witnesses are not notaries. Anyone who testifies before the group is a witness, and the reliability of all witness testimony is determined by the group. The group should execute this procedure in its entirety and cannot be changed without the unanimous agreement of the three commissioners, nor can its implementation be hindered by any excuse. This directive is signed by CCP representative Ye Jianying, government representative Zheng Jiemin, and U.S. representative Robertson.

　　北平中共代表团发言人答记者
    安平镇事件调处受阻真象完全是蒋美双方故意留难
    三委员获致安平调查程序协议
    【新华社北平十四日电】（迟到）本社特派记者十二日晨访问北平中共代表团发言人，叩询安平事件发生后二十五特别小组未能顺利进行工作之真相。问答如次：问：二十五特别小组何时组成？答：于七月二十九日安平事件后，中共方面即向美方提议派小组调查，至八月一日始决定派遣小组。问：一日已派遣小组，何以五日才开始工作？答：照执行部向例，小组应由美方主席召集，二十五小组美方代表三日始通知，四日上午九时开会，但至四日开会时，美代表戴维斯又借口忙于搜集材料未允开会。问：小组何时开始工作？答：五日上午开始，惟该日下午政府代表吴定能突又以代表资格问题，反对中共代表黄逸峰少将参加小组，致该日会议毫无结果。问：以后数日工作进程如何？答：六、七两日，由于美代表企图强制小组单独听取美方指定人员之报告，拒绝中共代表确定工作程序的提议，致数日工作毫无成绩。问：小组出发视察否？答：三委员原定小组于八日上午出发，但临时美代表忽欲限制小组人数，谓每组不得超过三人，当中共代表据理驳斥后，戴维斯又以不供给车辆威胁，同时又坚持检查中共组员身份证，以致延至下午二时始出发。问：安平视察情形如何？答：安平地形一片平原，全系开阔地，白日打伏击绝不可能，且所称工事阻碍物等均属捏造，可证明者，为政府军于七月二十九日配合美军进攻后，即已占领该地，该地情势变动，民众受国民党军威胁不能自由表明军事实际真象。问：曾与当地中共军司令部联络否？答：政府代表坚决反对去中共地区，因之未能成行，中共派定之联络官亦因政府拒绝保证安全，至今未能出发，现萧克将军已再次电催小组前往，因该处指挥官已等待九日了。问：程序问题何以成为争执之焦点？答：国美双方企图仅让小组听取美海军陆战队及美方指定之证人的报告，不准备到中共地区调查，并以不保证安全，使中共人员不能来北平，而由蒋美双方来一个“缺席裁判”，将片面报告公布，因此他们就不肯要程序，而中共方面认为必须有程序，且应保证执行程序始能有说明真实事迹的机会。问：有人谓中共拖延调查确否？答：现安平已被国民党军占领，香河冲突又日形扩大，而蒋美双方作荒诞的宣传，致使若干人均不明真象，故我方要求彻查真象，以期水落石出，远较蒋美双方更为迫切。
    【新华社北平十五日电】关于安平小组调查程序，执行部三委员于昨日已获致协议如下：（１）询问及记录美方证人傅瑞慈少校等二人之证言，此二人系执行部人员搭乘美陆战队武装巡逻队护送之运输队车辆者。（２）询问及记录美陆战队队长贝尔查中校及美陆战队参加冲突之人员。（３）访问、询问及记录参加冲突之中共军指挥官及士兵证言。（４）视察冲突之地区并访问及记录其他证人之证言。（５）询问及记录天津美陆战队第一师司令官骆基中将及十一战区长官孙连仲将军及事件发生地区中共军高级指挥官之证言。（６）询问及记录若干其他证言人证言，此等证人为每一方面所认为求得事件真象所必须征询者。（７）访问、询问及记录中共所称曾参加冲突而为政府及美陆战队方面所承认之国民党军队是否事实。（８）召集小组会议，准备向三委员提出报告，小组会议主席由三方面轮流担任。兹更协定各类证人之间不应有所差别，无论彼等在冲突期间是否在该地，证人并非公证人，凡在小组前作证之人即为证人，所有证人证言的可靠程度由小组决定之。由此程序小组应全部执行，非经三人委员一致同意不得变更，更不能得以任何借口阻碍其实行。本指令由中共代表叶剑英、政府代表郑介民、美代表饶伯森签字。
