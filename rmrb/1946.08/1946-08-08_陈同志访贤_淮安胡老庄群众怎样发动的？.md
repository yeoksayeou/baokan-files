　　Comrade Chen Visits the Wise
    ——How were the masses of Hulaozhuang, Huai'an mobilized?
    Hulaozhuang was a "blank village"
    Hulaozhuang is a small village in Yuezhuang Village, Eqian Township, Shitou District, Huai'an. All fourteen families in the village were tenant farmers who suffered cruel exploitation by feudal forces year-round, living worse than animals. When the work team first organized the masses in Eqian Township to fight against traitors, Hulaozhuang also organized a farmers' association and a women's association, but all the participants from each family were children, old men, and old women. Not a single young person participated, and the two female leaders in their forties and fifties did not manage things. When the work team summarized its work, it found that although this village had the framework of mass organizations, it was a "blank village." The second time the work team went to Eqian Township, all the villages in the township were very active, but Hulaozhuang remained like a stagnant pond, and the village and township cadres felt helpless.
    Comrade Chen's first "visit to the wise"
    Later, Hulaozhuang was assigned to Dongzhuang Village. Comrade Chen of Dongzhuang Village carefully studied the situation in Hulaozhuang and found that the reason for not mobilizing the masses was mainly "no one taking the lead." Therefore, he decided to first find activists to enlighten and organize the masses.
    Hu Lianhai was a young man who had suffered in the past, so Comrade Chen decided to target him. One day, Comrade Chen met Hu Lianhai, talked to him about his past suffering, and mobilized him to work for the people. When he heard this, he blushed and was about to leave, saying, "I don't have time to do it." Comrade Chen asked him who in the village could work for the people because he was eager to get away. He said, "We are uneducated people and cannot handle things. You can talk to Third Master in the west and Erquan in my family." Then he left.
    The search for Hu Lianhai failed in this way. Comrade Chen reviewed the reasons for the failure and concluded that he was too impatient, mobilizing him to work for the people at the first meeting, which made things awkward.
    Comrade Chen's second "visit to the wise"
    What kind of person was Third Master? After inquiring from all sides, he learned that he was an old man named Hu Biyou, over sixty years old, skilled in farming, and had prestige in the village. The farmers in the village all trusted him, so Comrade Chen decided to find him.
    The first time Comrade Chen went to Hu Biyou's house for a casual chat, Hu Biyou was very restrained. Comrade Chen thought that if he immediately talked about the exploitation of landlords, he would definitely not be willing to talk about it, so he started with "Er Huang." Comrade Chen said, "In the past, how did the 'Er Huang' treat the people here?" Hu Biyou replied, "Alas! We suffered a lot!" The conversation started in this way, from "Er Huang" to the old Central Government, from the old Central Government to the New Fourth Army, gradually shaking Hu Biyou's "changing the world" ideology. But Hu Biyou was still just evasively responding without expressing his attitude, so Comrade Chen bid farewell and left. Before leaving, he encouraged him, saying, "You are the senior elder in this village. Whether the village is doing well or not depends on you, old man, taking the lead!"
    Enlightening the masses from all aspects
    The day after the conversation, Comrade Chen went to Hulaozhuang again to convene a village meeting, but did not raise the issue of calculating rent accounts. Instead, he generally unblocked ideas and talked about many examples of other villages actively calculating rent accounts. After this, activists in Huzhuang, such as Shen Yuzhen, also came over to discuss with the tenant farmers during their free time in the morning and evening. Shen Yuzhen asked, "Isn't this strange? You farm Liu Hetai's land, and I also farm Liu Hetai's land. You don't pay pre-borrowed wheat, soy sauce wheat, or puppet fees, but we suffer. Does he treat you especially well?" The people of Hulaozhuang were all silent and didn't speak, but they gradually became active inside. Two or three days later, he met Hu Biyou again. Hu Biyou was much more polite than last time, inviting Comrade Chen to sit in a house. He talked freely about the suffering under "Er Huang," saying, "When repairing the ghost dike, our village provided more labor than others, and the puppet fees were also more than others. We poor people provided money and labor, and they still scolded us as stubborn fools!" Seeing that the conversation was gradually becoming congenial, Comrade Chen explained to him the government's rules (referring to policies and laws) and the fact that the democratic government worked for the people, and further inspired him to come out and take the lead, saying, "In the past, you suffered from others. Now you have something to say and a reason to speak. You won't be bullied anymore." After talking for a long time, Comrade Chen remembered that he believed in Township Head Zhao Biwen and Zhao Zeng, and said to Hu, "Third Master! You have to take the lead in calculating the rent accounts in your village!" He first used Township Head Zhao's words as a lead to talk to him, linking it to the rent accounts of Hulaozhuang. However, he did not immediately mobilize them to take action. Instead, he changed the subject and cited many examples of calculating rent accounts, such as the land of Shen Yuzhen's family in Houhuzhuang, which had been forcibly taken away by the village head, but now it has been calculated back! He talked while watching his reaction.
    Breaking concerns, Hu Biyou dares to come forward
    At this time, Hu Biyou did not mention that there was no account to calculate, and his heart was gradually moving. But at the same time, new doubts arose. Liu Hetai has fields in Qiudong Township and Bodian Township. It's not worth leading the trouble in one village. If he can mobilize three townships, this village can also be counted. On the one hand, he thought that Liu Hetai's village head, Yu Bingrong, was good at speaking and writing, and he couldn't outtalk him. Seeing this, Comrade Chen immediately told him in response to these two points: (1) Whichever township can calculate first and take advantage of it, calculate it first. If you are afraid of offending people, he is also afraid of offending people. Who will come forward first? (2) Only with reason can you win people over. Relying solely on being able to speak is useless.
    Considering that their concerns could not be eliminated for a while, Comrade Chen bid farewell and left again. After this conversation, Hu Biyou was invited to participate in several village and township meetings related to calculating rent accounts. At these meetings, Hu Biyou saw many practical examples and gained a lot of knowledge, which greatly changed his thinking, abandoning his concerns about "not worth it" and "offending people." In particular, other villages had already calculated their accounts in a lively manner, and no one was willing to lag behind, which greatly changed his "changing the world" ideology.
    The third time, Comrade Chen found Hu Biyou again and directly raised the issue of calculating rent accounts in Hulaozhuang. Comrade Chen said, "Whether the accounts in this village are calculated well or not depends entirely on you, old man, taking the lead!" At this time, Hu Biyou's thinking on calculating accounts was almost mature. Remembering the suffering he had endured from the owner in the past, he patted his chest and resolutely said, "Our village has also decided to calculate!"
    The masses act
    During the transformation of their thinking, the farmers in the village often chatted with the activists in the village, and Shen Yuzhen of Huzhuang often went to the village to resolutely enlighten them, so their thinking had changed. The accumulated hatred over the years aroused the urgent demand to calculate rent accounts with the owner. Several activists were discovered among the farmers in the village, such as Hu Dianyang, Hu Diancui, and Hu Dianbang.
    After Hu Biyou made his decision, he immediately acted and convened a village meeting of all villagers. Hu Biyou asked, "The whole Houzhuang has calculated their accounts. What should we do in our village?" Then he pressed, "Regardless of whether you calculate or not, I'm going to calculate!" At this time, Hu Dianyang and Hu Diancui then said, "When will we have to suffer? My family has also decided to calculate." So all the tenant farmers in the village demanded to calculate accounts with the owner. In the afternoon of the meeting, Comrade Chen went to Hulaozhuang again. The people in the village all gathered around and asked, "Comrade Chen! How should we calculate the rent accounts in our village? Other families have already calculated them." Comrade Chen said, "That depends on yourselves; do you have accounts to calculate?" Everyone said in a hubbub, "How can there be no accounts to calculate! Pre-borrowed wheat, soy sauce wheat, puppet fees, meals, which one is missing! The rent is twelve dou, and we suffered a lot in the past!" The next day, the farmers of Hulaozhuang began to calculate rent accounts with the owner, poured out their bitterness of many years, and achieved a glorious victory.

### 陈同志访贤——淮安胡老庄群众怎样发动的？

　　陈同志访贤
    ——淮安胡老庄群众怎样发动的？
    胡老庄是个“空白村”
    胡老庄是淮安石塘区鹅钱乡岳庄村的一个小庄。全庄十四家全是佃农，一年四季受着封建势力的残酷剥削，过着牛马不如的生活。工作队第一次在鹅钱乡组织群众反汉奸进行斗争时，胡老庄也组织了农会和妇女会，但每家所参加的尽是小孩老头和老妈妈，少年人没有一个参加，组长是两个四五十岁的妇女并不管事。工作队总结工作时，发现这个庄虽然有了群众团体架子却是个“空白庄”。第二次工作队又到鹅钱乡工作，这时全乡各庄都闹的很热火，而胡老庄却仍像一池死水不动，村乡工作的干部感到没有办法。
    陈同志第一次“访贤”
    后来胡老庄划给董庄村了。董庄村的陈同志仔细研究了胡老庄的情况发现没有发动起来的原因，主要是“没有人带头”，因此决定首先找出积极分子来进行启发和组织群众的工作。
    胡连海是过去受过罪的小伙子，陈同志便确定以他为对象。有一天陈同志和胡连海碰到了，和他谈起他过去受的罪便动员他去替老百姓做事。他听到急得红着脸就要走，他说：“我没有功夫做。”陈同志问他庄上谁能替老百姓做事，因为他要急于脱身便说：“我们粗人不能办事，西头三老爷和我们家二全，你可和他谈谈。”说完就走了。
    找胡连海就这样失败了。陈同志检讨失败的原因是太性急，初次见面就动员他为老百姓做事，以致把事情弄僵了。
    陈同志第二次“访贤”
    三老爷是个什么样的人呢？经过各方面了解是一个叫胡必友的老头子，已六十多岁，种田精明，在庄上有威信，庄上的农民都相信他，于是陈同志便决定去找他。
    第一次陈同志到胡必友家去闲谈，胡必友非常拘束。陈同志想马上就谈地主剥削，他必然不肯谈，于是先从“二皇”谈起。陈同志说：“过去‘二皇’在这里老百姓怎么样呀？”胡必友回答说：“唉！受的罪大呢！”谈话就这样开始了，由“二皇”进到老中央，由老中央谈到新四军，就渐渐地动摇了胡必友的“变天”思想。但是胡必友还只是吞吞吐吐的应付着不表示态度，陈同志便告辞走了。临走时鼓励他说：“你是这一庄的老长辈，庄上闹得好不好，就在乎你老人家领头呀！”
    各方面启发群众觉悟
    谈话后一天，陈同志又到胡老庄召开村民会，但未提出算租账问题，而是一般的打通思想讲了许多别的庄积极算租账的例子。这以后，胡庄的积极分子沈玉贞等也在早晚空闲时过来和佃户们商谈。沈玉贞问道：“这个怪呢？你们种刘和太家的田我也种刘和太家的田，你们不交预借麦、酱麦、伪费，我们却受罪，他待你们特别好吗？”胡老庄的人都是默默地嘴里不讲，但内心却渐渐动起来。隔了两三天和胡必友又见面，胡必友比上次客气得多，让陈同志到一家里去坐，他畅谈起受“二皇”的罪说：“修鬼圩子时，我们庄上出夫比人家多出，伪费也比人家多，出钱出夫都是我们穷人，还开口骂我们是死顽固肉头！”陈同志见话渐渐投机，便向他解释政府的规矩（指政策法令）及民主政府为老百姓办事等事实，更进一步启发他出来带头说：“过去受人家的罪，现在有话可说，有理可讲，你就不再受气了。”谈了好久，陈同志想起他相信乡长赵必文、赵曾，对胡说：“三老爷呀！你的庄上你要带头把租账算好呀！”首先用赵乡长的话作引线和他谈，联系到胡老庄的租账。但却未立即发动他们起来行动，即掉转话锋举出许多算租账的例子，如后胡庄沈玉贞家的田，曾被庄头强迫拿去，现在不是已经算回来了吗！一面谈一面看他的反应。
    打破顾虑胡必友敢出头
    这时胡必友已不提没账算，心里渐渐活动了。但同时却又发生新的疑问。刘和太在邱东乡、博甸都有田，一个庄上犯不着带头恼人，如能动员三个乡这个庄也可算。一面想刘和太家的庄头禺秉荣，会说会写说不过他。陈同志看出后，马上针对这两点告诉他：（一）那乡可以单独先算那乡先讨巧，如你怕恼人他也怕恼人，那个先出头呢？（二）有理才能赢人，单靠会说是没有用的。
    因为考虑到他们的顾虑一时未能去掉，陈同志便又告辞走了。在这一次谈话以后，胡必友又被请去参加了好几次村和乡有关算租账的会议。在这些会议上胡必友见到许多实际例子，增长了许多见识，因之思想上起了很大变化，抛去了“犯不着”“恼人”的顾虑，特别是别村都已轰轰烈烈算过账谁也不肯落后，大大的变了他的“变天”思想。
    第三次陈同志又找到胡必友直接提出胡老庄算租账问题，陈同志说：“这个庄的账算得好不好，全在你老人家领头了！”这时胡必友的算账思想已将近成熟，他想起过去受主人的罪，便拍着胸脯毅然说：“我们这个庄也决定算了！”
    群众行动起来了
    庄上的农民在思想转变中，常跟村中的积极分子闲谈，胡庄沈玉贞又常到庄上决心启发，因此思想上都有了变化。过去多年积下的仇恨激起向主人算租账的迫切要求。在全庄农民中发现了好几个积极分子，如胡殿扬、胡殿翠、胡殿邦等。
    胡必友在下了决心以后，便立即行动起来召开全庄庄民会。胡必友问道：“后庄全算过账了，我们庄上怎么办？”接着又逼一句说：“不管你们算不算，反正我要算！这时胡殿扬、胡殿翠便接着说：“罪还要受到什么时候？我家也决定算了。”于是全庄佃户都要求向主人算账了。开会的下午，陈同志又到胡老庄去，庄上的人都围过来纷纷问：“陈同志！我们庄上的租账怎么算呀？别人家都算过了。”陈同志说：“这在乎你们自己；你们有账算吗？”大家七嘴八舌的说：“那里没账算呢！预借麦、酱麦、伪费、供饭那一样没有呀！租子是十二斗的，过去受的罪大呢！”第二天胡老庄的农民便开始向主人算租账，倾吐了多年来的苦水，得到了光荣的胜利。（新华社淮阴通讯）。
