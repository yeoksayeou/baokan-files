　　Local Militia Rotate for Self-Defense
    Coordinating with Main Forces to Launch Guerrilla Offensives
    Militia in Nine Counties Including Linfen Eliminate and Capture Over 300 Stubborn Enemies and Puppets in Two Months
    [Report from this newspaper] Chiang Kai-shek, relying on American-style equipment, is expanding the civil war. Our liberated area's military and civilians are forced to defend themselves. A widespread guerrilla movement has now been launched in various border areas. In the Taiyue Second Military Sub-district, 5,000 militia members from nine counties, including Linfen and Quwo, are organized for rotational combat, conducting independent guerrilla activities on a 250-li long front from Jiang County in the south to Hongdong in the north, and undertaking rear area security work. Qin Qichang, a militia hero from Hongdong, using sniper fire combined with explosives, killed and wounded 27 Yan army soldiers in one instance. It is estimated that the militia in these nine counties conducted 283 self-defense battles in June and July, killing and wounding 298 Chiang, Yan, and puppet troops, capturing over 200 alive, and capturing 15 Chiang-Yan secret agents, seizing one machine gun and 13 rifles. Over a hundred militiamen in Jun County, Fourth Military Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, launched a fierce guerrilla offensive to commemorate "August 1st," completely eliminating a unit of over 30 puppet troops under Niu Yingde stationed at Daokou, and seizing one machine gun, 45 rifles, and five pistols. The masses in the border areas of Anyang, Qingfeng, and other places, unable to bear the devastation of the Chiang and puppet troops, spontaneously organized stretcher teams, transport teams, and combat teams to participate in the war at any time. The masses in the rear also automatically cultivate land on behalf of the militia who are persisting in guerrilla warfare at the front. In the Yan-puppet occupied area of ​​Taihang Taigu, five youths from Huian and Xinzhuang risked escape while the Yan army's Houcheng Township political defense regiment was conscripting men. They captured alive a plainclothes member of the Yan army escorting them, along with a rifle and over 50 rounds of ammunition, and victoriously arrived in a certain area of ​​our liberated area.
    [Report from this newspaper, Changzhi] The Shahe militia, in order to support the border struggle on the front lines of Yuan (shi) Huo (lu) Jing (xing) and to avenge the Yuan Shi Nan Su massacre, a strong militia detachment of over a hundred people was specially drawn by the county armed forces committee to form an expeditionary company, which set off for the northern front on July 20. When they departed, the villages gave them a warm send-off. The village chiefs and mutual aid team leaders all guaranteed to cultivate the land well for the families of the militia going on the expedition. The morale of the expeditionary militia was extremely high. When passing through Nanxingguo Village in Zanhuang, they received a notice that a heroes' meeting would be held in the whole region after the autumn harvest, which further encouraged their fighting enthusiasm. Everyone made their own plans. Old hero Hao Xiaosan proposed launching a sniper warfare campaign, vowing to kill eight stubborn enemies and puppets who dared to invade in the self-defense war. Chen Heqing then competed with Hao Xiaosan, and everyone actively considered how to strive to be a combat hero.
    [Report from this newspaper, Changzhi] The Taigu County Headquarters issued an emergency instruction at the end of last month, calling on the local armed forces and militia of the entire county to launch a fierce guerrilla war and landmine explosion campaign, thoroughly blocking the stubborn enemy and puppet strongholds, in order to smash the Yan stubborn enemy’s attempt to divide our Taigu Liberated Area's plain areas. It was decided: 1. The County Armed Forces Committee will draw ten old area explosive experts to train militia in various new area villages, universally launching the landmine explosion campaign. 2. Quickly rectify the village militias, form guerrilla groups, take advantage of the rising green gauze curtains to carry out sparrow warfare, and attack small groups of stubborn enemies and puppet troops who come out to harass and plainclothes secret agents. And strengthen joint defense, with close contact between villages, supporting each other. 3. The militia in villages surrounding each stronghold will strictly surround the stronghold. The militia in old area mountain villages will organize rotation defense, guarding mountain passes and assisting in the siege of nearby stubborn enemy and puppet strongholds. 4. When the local backbone armed forces are on guard in each district by company, the company commander and political instructor will participate in the district headquarters to lead the local militia to act in unison. 5. Rectify the intelligence network, ensuring it is swift and accurate.
