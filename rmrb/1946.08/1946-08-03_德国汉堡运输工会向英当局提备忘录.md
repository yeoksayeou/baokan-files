Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 30th: Hamburg Dispatch: The Transport Workers' Union here submitted a memorandum to the British military occupation authorities on the 28th, declaring: Hamburg workers cannot endure another winter like last year. The memorandum stated: "The nearby trees were all cut down last winter, and there will be no firewood to burn this winter. We must be provided with sufficient coal. If the workers' families have no hot water to drink, and they themselves are freezing in the workshops, and return home to find their families shivering with cold, then they will be unable to work and produce. In addition to the rationed food, the prices of necessities have risen a lot, and wages cannot even buy the rationed food." Furthermore, according to a Reuter's dispatch: Mr. Shingler, an administrator in the British-occupied zone of Germany, told the British House of Commons on the 2nd of this month that the daily caloric intake of Germans in the British-occupied zone is only 1,050 calories, which is half of the normal human minimum requirement. He also stated: Since the reduction of German food rations in March, the people have been suffering from malnutrition. The American New Republic magazine stated: One of Britain's policies in its occupied territories is to first starve and freeze the people in the area, making them unable to engage in political activities, and then provide a small amount of relief to seek the latter's "gratitude" and pro-British sentiment.

　　德国汉堡运输工会向英当局提备忘录
    【新华社延安三十日电】汉堡讯：此间运输工会二十八日向英军占领当局提出一备忘录宣称：汉堡工人不能再忍受一个像去年一样的冬天。备忘录称：“附近的树，去冬都砍光了，今冬将无柴可烧，必须供给我们以足够的煤，假如工人们的家庭没有热水喝，他们自己在工作间也要受冻，回到家里一家人冻得发抖，那末他们是无法工作与生产的。除了配给食物之外，必需品的价格涨了很多，工资甚至连配给食物都买不起”。又据路透社电讯：德境英占领区行政人员辛特尔，曾于本月二日告英下院称：英占领区德人每日所得热量仅一千零五十卡洛里，为平常人类最低需要量之半。又称：自三月份减低德人粮食配给量以来，人民均患营养不良症。美国新共和杂志称：英国对其占领区政策之一，即先使该区人民频于冻饿，使其无力从事政治活动，然后施以少量救济，求取后者之“感激”与亲英。
