Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 16th: According to TASS, New York, August 12th: Many American democrats have written articles condemning the U.S. authorities for fostering a dictatorial regime in the Philippines and helping reactionaries conduct a civil war. Former U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes, in the New York Sun, condemned the American press for failing to publish the true news from the Philippines. After announcing that a civil war was underway there, Ickes pointed out that Roxas was not only using American weapons to suppress the People's Anti-Japanese Army, but was also attempting to eliminate all opposition through a series of anti-democratic measures. Undoubtedly, someone will demand the mobilization of U.S. troops stationed in the Philippines to "suppress the riots" and protect the Roxas government they have established. What a beautiful action this is! American troops are defending the Philippine dictatorial regime behind an iron curtain. There are now 90,000 American troops in the Philippines and 25,000 Filipino indigenous soldiers have been recruited. What reason does the United States have to maintain 115,000 troops in the Philippines? In 1935, the total number of U.S. standing army troops was only 138,000. Radio commentator Volger sternly criticized the U.S. policy of maintaining Roxas, saying: The reason the United States prefers Roxas is because Roxas is a conservative. Mr. Alba, in "Far Eastern Review," wrote an article criticizing the United States for participating in the suppression of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, pointing out that just before the declaration of "independence," the U.S. military had provided Roxas with $50 million worth of military equipment.

　　美当局在菲扶植独裁政权
    帮助反动派打内战
    美国民主人士著文谴责
    【新华社延安十六日电】据塔斯社纽约十二日电：美国民主人士多人撰文谴责美国当局在菲律滨扶植独裁政权帮助反动派进行内战。美国前内长伊克斯在纽约太阳报上谴责美国报界未登载菲律滨的真实消息，伊克斯在宣布那里内战在进行中之后，指出罗哈斯不但利用美国的武器镇压人民抗日军，而且经过一连串的反民主措施，企图消灭一切反对派。无疑的，有人会要求动员驻防菲岛的美国军队来“镇压骚乱”，保护被他们建立起来的罗哈斯政府。这是多么漂亮的一种行动呀！美国军队在保卫着铁幕后面的菲独裁政权。现在菲律滨有九万美军，并已征幕了二万五千菲土著兵。什么理由美国要在菲维持十一万五千军队呢？一九三五年，美国常备军通共不过十三万八千人。无线电评论家伏德格严斥美国维护罗哈斯的政策，他说：美国所以宁愿要罗哈斯，乃因为罗哈斯是保守分子。阿尔巴拉氏在“远东评论”撰文斥责美国参加了对人民抗日军的镇压，指出恰在宣布“独立”之前，美军曾增罗哈斯以价值五千万美元的军事装备。
