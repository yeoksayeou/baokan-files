　　[Reported by this newspaper from Handan on the 20th] General Liu Bocheng and others of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, upon learning that Jiang Jiabin, Commander of the 18th Column of the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Border Region, had led his troops in holding high the banner of anti-civil war righteousness, sent a telegram to congratulate him. The original telegram is as follows:
　　Commander Jiang Jiabin,
　　Having read your telegram, we are filled with admiration! Your troops defended the country and protected the people during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Kuomintang authorities not only failed to commend and cherish you but instead ordered you to participate in the traitorous civil war, making you enemies of the people. The so-called "atonement for crimes through meritorious service" is in reality a mad and unheard-of act of harming the country and the people and eliminating dissidents. This time, Your Excellency has led all the officers and soldiers of the 18th Column in holding high the banner of righteousness for democracy and national salvation, resolutely withdrawing from the traitorous civil war. This is not only a head-on blow to the instigators of the civil war but also a powerful support for the national democratic and patriotic movement, greatly benefiting the nation and the country. The national crisis is worsening. Saving the country and defending the people is our duty. Let us encourage each other! We send this telegram to express our congratulations and to salute the war of patriotic self-defense!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Teng Daiyuan, Bo Yibo, Wang Hongkun, Zhang Jichun, Li Da

    [Reported by this newspaper from Handan on the 22nd] General Gao Shuxun sent a telegram to Hao Pengju, Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Democratic Allied Army, to congratulate him. The original telegram is as follows:
    Commander-in-Chief Hao Pengju, my dear brother Tengxiao: I was extremely excited when I heard about your uprising in southern Shandong. Now, having read your public telegram of August 8, denouncing the dictatorial civil war and upholding peace and democracy, your righteousness and forceful words are deeply admired! At a time when the reactionaries are relying on foreign forces to undermine peace and the crisis of civil war is worsening, your call to action will be echoed by the people of the whole country. Our army is determined to work together and advance side by side to achieve the complete victory of the cause of peace and democracy. This is a brief expression of my thoughts. I hope you will take it into consideration.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Gao Shuxun

    蒋嘉宾司令勋鉴：删电诵悉，不胜钦佩！贵部八年抗战，保国卫民，国民党当局不但不予表扬爱护，反而勒令参加卖国内战，与民为敌，所谓“戴罪立功”，实则祸国殃民、消除异己，丧心病狂，世所鲜闻。贵司令此次率十八纵队全体将士高举民主救国之义旗，毅然退出卖国内战，不仅予内战卖国祸首以当头棒喝，益且给予全国民主爱国运动以有力声援，造福民族国家甚巨。民族危机，有加无已，救国卫民，吾辈天职，愿共勉之！特电申贺，并致爱国自卫战争之礼！
