Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 5th. The CCP Central Jin-Sui Sub-Bureau Senior Cadre Meeting successfully concluded a few days ago. The central task of the meeting was to review mass movements, troop work, and financial work. During the discussion, Shuoxian County's report on boldly mobilizing the masses and Linxian County's report on the leadership style of the mass line served as typical examples. Zhang Chuyuan, the creator of the Jin-Sui Border Region's combination of labor and military affairs, reported on his work in one village, providing the conference with a highly educational demonstration. After analyzing the current international and domestic situation, Comrade He Long clearly pointed out two central tasks: First, to mobilize the masses to thoroughly reduce rent and interest rates, so that farmers can become masters of their own destiny, have land to cultivate, expand production, and increase grain and cloth production to solve the clothing and food problems of five million people. Second, to build a people's army, protect the fruits of victory, defend the border region, stop the civil war, and safeguard peace and democracy. In the discussion on mobilizing the masses, the meeting believed that the rent and interest reduction movement in the border region over the past nine years, especially since 1943, had achieved great results. After the great counter-offensive against the Japanese invaders last year, the newly recovered areas had largely carried out the work of anti-traitor liquidation, and some areas had launched rent reduction movements. Comrade Zhang Jiafu pointed out in his report that there were and still are many shortcomings in the work. In the interior, the main problem was the lack of clarity in policy and ideology, which damaged the interests of some middle peasants and excessively damaged the interests of some rich peasants, thus affecting the development of production. Another problem was the work style of taking over and forcing orders, which still seriously existed in some areas, also hindering the masses' genuine conscious movement. In the new areas, the main problem was the failure to seize the opportunity and lead the mass movement according to the needs of the masses, so that the development of the movement was not rapid, continuous, and universal enough.

Comrades He Long and Zhu Jingquan pointed out when reviewing the relationship between the army and the masses that the army violated the interests of the masses and should admit its mistakes to the masses and compensate for the losses suffered. When reviewing financial work, they criticized the purely financial viewpoint as a viewpoint of the old regime that was divorced from the masses. The conference especially pointed out that the correct financial work policy should be to develop production, first of all to develop the production of five million people, and at the same time to develop the production of organs, troops, and personnel. The conference decided to recommend to the government that the public grain for national construction must be reduced to at least one-third of the amount collected last year, and all old public grain debts that the poor are unable to pay should be completely exempted. Loaned grain and loans that cannot be repaid should also be reduced or exempted as appropriate, and agricultural loans, seedling loans, and textile loans should be issued in large quantities, using all methods and the greatest efforts to help the broad masses of people develop production and improve their lives. In terms of organs and troops, equal emphasis should be placed on production and thrift, advocating that everyone does their best, developing production in both aspects, carrying forward the tradition of hard work and arduous struggle, opposing speculation and taking shortcuts, and opposing corruption and waste, practicing strict economy, and cherishing manpower and materials. Comrade He Long especially called on all comrades to fight against all corrupt and wasteful elements, work hard to produce, practice thrift, and reduce the burden on the people.

Regarding the issue of army work, Comrade Gan Siqi emphasized in his report the opposition to purely military viewpoints, and proposed that at present, the training of the army should be strengthened, the army should universally participate in mass movements, the construction of the militia should be strengthened, and preferential treatment for military dependents should be strengthened so that families can obtain land. He also called on local comrades in various places to take the same responsibility for this work. All the reports and discussions of the conference were permeated with the idea of serving the people, the style of the mass line, and the spirit of self-criticism. Many comrades conducted profound introspection. The conference especially called on the spirit of the senior cadre meeting to be brought to all parts of the country. Comrade He Long finally earnestly urged everyone to go deep into the rural areas and companies, carry out meticulous and arduous work, and truly mobilize the five million people.

　　中共中央晋绥分局高干会议
    检讨群运部队财经工作
    贺龙同志谆谆叮嘱深入农村与连队艰苦工作
    【新华社兴县五日电】中共中央晋绥分局高级干部会议已于日前胜利闭幕，会议的中心任务为检讨群众运动、部队工作与财经工作。在讨论中，朔县关于大胆放手发动群众、临县关于群众路线的领导作风，曾作了典型报告，晋绥边区劳武结合的创造者张初元，报告了自己所做的一个村的工作。给大会以极富教育意义的示范。贺龙同志于分析国际国内目前形势后，即明确的指出两个中心工作：一是发动群众彻底减租减息，使农民翻身，有田可种，扩大生产增产粮食布匹，解决五百万人民的穿衣吃饭问题。二是建设人民的军队，保卫胜利果实，保卫边区，制止内战，保卫和平民主。在关于发动群众的讨论中，会议认为九年来特别是从四三年以来边区减租减息运动获得了很大成绩，在去年对日寇大反攻后，新收复的地区，大部分已经普遍进行了反奸清算工作，其中一部分地区已展开了减租运动。张稼夫同志在报告中指出工作中存在过而且尚存在着不少缺点，在内地则主要为政策思想不明确，损伤了一部分中农的利益，与过分的损伤了有些富农利益，因此影响了生产的发展。另一为包办代替强迫命令的作风，在某些地区尚严重存在，这也阻碍了群众真正的自觉运动。在新区主要是没有掌握时机，没按群众需要领导群众运动，使运动的发展不够迅速、连续与普遍。
    贺龙同志和朱井泉同志在检讨军队与群众关系时，指出军队违犯了群众利益，应向群众承认错误及赔偿其所受损失。于检讨财经工作时，批评了单纯的财政观点是脱离群众的旧政权的观点。大会特别指出正确的财政工作的方针，应为发展生产，首先是发展五百万人民的生产，同时亦要发展机关部队人员的生产。大会决定向政府建议，建国公粮至少须减低至去年征收的三分之一，所有贫苦无力完纳的旧欠公粮，应一律豁免。旧欠而无力偿还之贷粮贷款亦应酌情免收，并大量发放农贷、青苗与纺织贷款，以一切方法用最大力量帮助广大人民发展生产，改善生活。在机关部队方面，以生产节约并重，提倡各尽其能，发展双方面的生产，发挥吃苦耐劳艰苦奋斗的传统，反对投机取巧，和借口生产侵犯群众利益，反对贪污浪费，厉行节约爱惜人力物力。贺龙同志特别号召所有同志与一切贪污浪费分子作斗争，努力生产节衣缩食，减轻人民负担。
    关于军队工作问题，甘泗淇同志在报告中强调的反对了单纯的军事观点，并提出目前应加强军队的训练，军队普遍参加群众运动，加强民兵建设，加强优抗工作，使家属获得土地。并号召各地地方同志对这一工作必须同样负起责任来。大会全部报告和讨论是贯穿着为人民服务的思想、与群众路线的作风、与自我批评的精神，许多同志都进行了深刻的反省，大会特别号召把高干会的精神带到各地去。贺龙同志最后更谆谆叮嘱深入农村与连队，进行细密的艰苦工作，把五百万人民真正发动起来。
