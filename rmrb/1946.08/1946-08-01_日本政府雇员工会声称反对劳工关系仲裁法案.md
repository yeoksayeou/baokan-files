　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th—According to a United Press report from Tokyo, the Government Employees Union has declared that if the Diet passes the government's proposed Labor Relations Arbitration Bill, they will seize control of government offices, because the bill does not recognize the rights of employees to strike and collectively bargain. The union strongly opposed the bill at a meeting on the 26th, and stated that it would petition the government and the Diet to demand amendments. At the same time, the Government Railway Workers Union is also discussing taking measures to oppose the Ministry of Transportation's plan, which stipulates a large-scale reduction of railway employees. The ministry calculates that there are currently 550,000 railway personnel, and with the addition of Japanese repatriated from overseas railways, the number will soon increase to 640,000. A union spokesperson revealed that the ministry intends to dismiss nearly 129,000 railway personnel. The Labor Relations Arbitration Bill stipulates that labor disputes will be arbitrated by the government, abolishing workers' right to strike. The bill was once proposed in the Japanese parliament at the end of last year but was not passed due to worker opposition. This time, the old tune is being replayed.

　　日本政府雇员工会声称反对劳工关系仲裁法案
    【新华社延安二十九日电】据合众社东京讯，政府雇员工会声称：假如国会通过政府提出之劳工关系仲裁法案，则他们即将夺取对政府办公所之控制，因该法案不承认雇员罢工及集体议价之权利，工会于二十六日会议上，强力反对此一法案。并称将向政府及国会请愿，要求修改。同时，政府铁路工人工会也正在讨论采取措施，反对传递省之计划，该计划规定大批裁减铁路员工，该省计算现有铁路人员五十五万人，加上遣送回国服务于海外铁路之日人，即将增至六十四万人。工会发言人揭发该省企图开除将近十二万九千铁路人员。按劳工关系仲裁法案，规定劳资纠纷由政府仲裁，取缔工人罢工权利，该法案去年年底曾一度在日议会提出，因遭工人反对而未通过，此次又被旧调重弹。
