Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Reuters, Washington, reports: The U.S. national budget for this year (July 1st of this year to June 30th of next year) cannot be balanced. Expenditures for this year are estimated at 41.5 billion U.S. dollars, while income is only 39.6 billion U.S. dollars (note: *U.S. News* magazine estimates it at 35.2 billion U.S. dollars), a difference of 1.9 billion. If the estimate of *U.S. News* magazine is used, the shortfall is 6.3 billion U.S. dollars. Truman himself admitted that the reason for the deficit was "maintaining a large army," etc.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Associated Press reports: Since the suspension of price controls, the prices of all goods in the United States have soared, so that some imported goods, even with freight and tariffs added, are still priced the same as those produced in the United States. According to the New York Journal of Commerce, in July, American companies were ordering machines from European countries because some European machines were cheaper. A large company has ordered various special equipment from Switzerland, the price of which is much lower than in the United States. Price controls in the U.S. were suspended on July 1st and will not be restored until August 20th, but the items subject to restored controls will be fewer than before June, and many goods have already increased in price during the period of suspended controls.

　　美国家预算入不敷出
    物价腾贵后外货大量涌入
    【新华社延安七日电】据路透社华府讯：美本年度（今年七月一日至明年六月三十日）国家预算无法平衡，本年度支出估计四百一十五亿美元，而收入仅三百九十六亿美元（按：《美国新闻》周刊估计则为三百五十二亿美元），相差十九亿，如以《美国新闻》周刊估计，则不足六十三亿美元。关于透支原因，杜鲁门自承为“维持庞大军队”等。
    【新华社延安七日电】美联社讯：自物价管制中止后，目前美国百物腾贵，以致一部分进口货虽加上运费及关税而售价仍与美国本国出产者相等。据纽约商务日报载称：七月间美国各公司以欧洲一部分机器价格较廉正向欧洲各国订购机器，某大公司已向瑞士订购各种特别的设备，其价格远较美国为低。按美物价管制系七月一日中止，八月二十日始可恢复，但其恢复管制之项目，将不如六月以前之多，而且许多货物在中止管制时期业已涨价。
