　　Cheng Guang Persuades Family
    Voluntarily Compensates the Masses for Losses

　　[Changzhi News] Cheng Shuquan (rich peasant), former finance committee member of Lingnan Village, Zuoquan, caused uncleared accounts and losses of public property. Currently, the masses are demanding compensation, but this has been delayed because Cheng is deceased. Cheng was a family member of a cadre, and his son, Cheng Guang, now works at the Taihang Xinhua Daily. Upon learning of this matter, he immediately requested leave to return home and persuade his family to actively resolve it. After Comrade Cheng Guang returned to the village and understood the situation, he adopted the principle of supporting the demands of the masses, earnestly persuading his mother on the one hand, and immediately settling accounts and negotiating solutions with cadres and the masses on the other hand. He voluntarily gave up more than ten mu of leased land and a portion of self-cultivated land, along with dozens of walnut trees, to the masses for cultivation, in order to offset the losses of public funds and public property in the village. The masses also gave appropriate consideration to his family's living situation. The process was extremely harmonious. Afterwards, Comrade Cheng also did his best to persuade and educate his family, strengthening their relationship with the masses. (Lin)

　　程光同志说服家庭
    主动赔偿群众损失
    【长治讯】左权岭南村前财政委员程树泉（富农）因账目不清与损失公物，目前群众要求赔偿，但因程已去世致迁延未决。程为干部家属，其子程光现在太行新华日报社工作。闻知此事，立即请假回家说服家庭主动解决。程光同志回村了解情况后，一面采取对群众要求撑腰的原则向其母亲苦口劝说，一面即与干部群众算账协商解决，自动以出租土地十余亩，自种土地一部连同核桃树数十棵让给群众耕种，以抵消村中公款与公物的损失。群众对其家庭生活亦作了适当的照顾，经过情形极为融洽。事后程同志又多方对其家庭进行说服教育，密切与群众关系。（林）
