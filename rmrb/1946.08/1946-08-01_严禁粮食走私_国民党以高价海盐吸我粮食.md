　　Strictly Prohibit Grain Smuggling
    The Kuomintang Uses High-Priced Sea Salt to Absorb Our Grain
    [This Newspaper] It is reported that the Kuomintang-controlled areas are experiencing a severe grain shortage and want to intensify the plundering of grain from our liberated areas. It is understood that their preliminary plan is to plunder two million shi of wheat from our area. Their method of plunder is mainly to exchange sea salt for grain from our area. In Shijiazhuang, every large dou of wheat is exchanged for 120 jin of salt; in Yuanshi, the enemy has coal and salt factories to plunder wheat, exchanging every jin of wheat for 7 jin of salt. Recently, the price of salt has risen sharply. In early July, 40 jin cost 1,000 yuan, but around July 20, it rose to 15 jin per 1,000 yuan. The reason for the price increase is an attempt to exchange sea salt for grain, cotton, and furs from our area.
    Currently, our border areas are stepping up strict management of imports and exports, strengthening anti-smuggling efforts, preventing hoarding and speculation, and prohibiting grain smuggling.

　　严禁粮食走私
    国民党以高价海盐吸我粮食
    【本报讯】国民党统治区因发生严重粮荒，欲加紧掠夺我解放区粮食。据悉：其初步计划，要在我区掠夺二百万石小麦；其掠夺办法主要是以海盐换取我区粮食。在石门，每大斗麦子换盐一百二十斤；在元氏，敌人设有掠夺麦子之煤盐厂，每斤麦子换盐七斤。最近盐价大涨，七月初每千元四十斤，至七月二十日左右则涨至每千元十五斤。其涨价原因乃是企图以海盐换取我区粮食、棉花和皮毛。
    现我边沿地区正加紧严格管理出入口，加强缉私，制止囤积投机，禁止粮食走私。
