Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: United Press, Calcutta reports: On the 29th, nearly one million people participated in the largest parade in Indian history. Striking factories, government offices, and shops were completely shut down. During the morning demonstration, workers marched along the streets for miles. They marched in formation to attend a meeting led by the Indian Communist Party and trade unions, shouting slogans along the way. Police everywhere had abandoned their duties and did not interfere with the progress of the marching队伍.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: New Delhi dispatch: India’s most despised "untouchables" for thousands of years have recently launched a movement against the British Cabinet Mission's White Paper. The "untouchables" condemned the British Cabinet Mission's plan for not taking care of their interests and therefore opposed the implementation of the White Paper in India. The "untouchables" movement began two weeks ago and was immediately met with brutal suppression by the British authorities. 1,100 people have been arrested and sentenced to various penalties, including 100 women, but the opposition movement has not stopped. The "Untouchables" Movement Committee announced that they are prepared to launch a large-scale resistance movement.

    【新华社延安三十一日电】新德里讯：数千年来最被鄙视的印度“贱民”，最近展开了反对英阁使团白皮书的运动，“贱民”谴责英阁使团计划并未照顾到他们的利益，因而反对白皮书在印实行。“贱民”运动开始在两周前，一开始便遭到英当局的残酷镇压，已有一千一百名被拘捕及判决各种刑罚，其中有妇女一百名，但反对运动迄今并未停止。“贱民”运动委员会宣布：他们准备发动规模宏大的反抗运动。
