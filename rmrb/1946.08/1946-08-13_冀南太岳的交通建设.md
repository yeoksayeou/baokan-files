　　Transportation Construction in Southern Hebei and Taiyue
　　[This newspaper, Weixian News] With the active efforts of the Party, government, army, and people, Southern Hebei's transportation construction has achieved great success. The total length of highways is 1,615 li. The north-south trunk line runs from Hengshui through Jixian, Nangong, Weixian, Quzhou, Guangping, Daming to Longwangmiao, with a total length of 430 li; the east-west trunk line runs from Gaotang through Xiazhen, Weixian, Wangguantun, Zhangxiaolu, Nanhe to Xingtai, with a total length of 300 li. Secondary branch lines include the section from Handan through Feixiang to Guangping, the section from Handan through Yongnian to Quzhou, the section from Xiazhen to Linqing, the section from Linqing to Wangguantun, the section from @Jin to Xinhe, the section from Baixiang through Yaoshan, Longping, Xingjiawan, Julu to Nangong, the section from Pingxiang through Jize to Quzhou, and the section from Jixian to Zaoqiang, all of which are open to traffic. The central cities of each district, such as Linqing, Weixian, Nangong, Feixiang, and Hengshui, are all well-connected. The Handan Dahua Company's automobile repair factory has set up a bus station in Weixian, the center of Southern Hebei. Civilian passenger cars have been running there since March, and merchants come and go in an endless stream, all praising its convenience. The entire district's telephone system, centered in Weixian, has six trunk lines connecting to each district, with a total length of 890 li. Each district has also repaired many branch lines, totaling 1,853 li, with a total of seven main switchboards and twenty sub-switchboards. At present, mutual contact between various places is becoming increasingly close, which will help the smooth development of the entire region's peaceful construction.
    Regarding postal services: Postal work has been established in all 43 counties in the region, the trunk lines have been improved, a postal network has been established, the lower levels have been strengthened, the shortcomings of slow service in rural areas compared to cities in the past have been overcome, truly serving the people and ensuring the rapid and accurate distribution of newspapers. Regarding the restoration of the Deshi Railway, since our Southern Hebei Fifth Special Administrative Region and the Central Hebei Sixth Special Administrative Region jointly formed the Deshi Railway Administration Bureau, education of the masses to love and protect the railway has achieved great results, and is currently continuing.
    The Weihe and Fuhe Rivers in Southern Hebei have always had developed shipping, with tens of thousands of boatmen relying on transportation to maintain their livelihoods. However, in recent years, due to the enemy's division and blockade, and the organization of so-called "river transportation" to levy "commodity taxes" and "landing taxes," boatmen have lost their jobs. After peace, the democratic government actively restored water conservancy, organized boat loans (Handan loaned out more than 300,000 yuan), and repaired damaged ships. On the Fuyang River, 32 boats have been repaired in Handan, 4 in Hengshui, and 30 in Zhangqiao, all of which are now navigable. Now, from Handan in the south, through Xingjiawan and Hengshui in the middle, to Zhangqiao in the north, a distance of 500 li, boats come and go in an endless stream. The lower reaches of the Fuhe River mostly transport coal, and as of now, the amount transported has reached 300,000 catties. The Grand Canal mainly transports cotton to the north. Many boatmen have not only resumed their livelihoods, but their lives have also improved. According to surveys, each boat takes seven days to travel upstream, carrying at least 30,000 catties; it takes three days to travel downstream, carrying at least 70,000 catties. After deducting the expenses of six or seven people, each boat can earn at least 100,000 yuan. Currently, preparations are being made to enter Tianjin, but there are puppet troops obstructing passage along the way. To protect the safety of transportation, the puppet troops must be disarmed immediately.
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng News] The Taiyue District has achieved remarkable results in the restoration and construction of highways, railways, and postal services in the past six months: (1) Highway construction. The five major highways of Linfen-Tunliu, Quwo-Gaoping, Jincheng-Yicheng, Jiyuan-Yuanqu, and Yicheng-Jiangxian, with a total length of more than 980 li, have been repaired. The roadbeds of the Lintun Highway (144 kilometers) and the Jinyi Highway (139 kilometers) were repaired in 66 days, and 47 bridges were erected. Due to the lack of transportation, only the Qugao, Jinyi, and Yijiang highways are open to traffic.
    (2) Railway construction. The Tongpu Railway, from Mengcheng to Shuitou, is 180 li long. Under the unified leadership of the "Transportation Restoration Committee" in southern Shanxi and the efforts of the Mengshui section of the Railway Administration Bureau, the entire line has been surveyed and a repair plan has been drafted. However, due to enemy and puppet sabotage, insufficient rails, serious equipment losses, and the vast amount of work required, coupled with the impact of the Kuomintang's expansion of the civil war, work has not yet begun.
    (3) Postal construction. The Taiyue Postal Administration Bureau has several branch bureaus, 35 county bureaus, and 28 trunk line stations, with five postal trunk lines and 16 branch lines, with a total length of 3,505 li. Significant progress has been made, especially in rural postal work. There are 416 rural postal trunk and branch lines, with a length of approximately 18,855 li, with 135 rural postal stations, 44 agency offices, and 2,511 relay stations distributed along the trunk and branch lines as connecting points, ensuring that postal work has not been hindered in any way in the past six months.

　　冀南太岳的交通建设
　　【本报威县讯】我冀南交通建设，在党政军民的积极努力下，已获巨大成绩。公路全长一千六百一十五华里，南北干线由衡水经冀县、南宫、威县、曲周、广平、大名至龙王庙，全长四百三十华里；东西干线由高唐经夏津、威县、王官屯、张销鹿、南和至邢台，全长三百华里。其次各支路由邯郸经肥乡至广平段，由邯郸经永年至曲周段，由夏津至临清段，由临清至王官屯段，由＠晋至新河段，由柏乡经尧山、隆平、邢家湾、巨鹿至南宫段，由平乡经鸡泽至曲周段，由冀县至枣强段均已通车。各分区中心城市临清、威县、南宫、肥乡、衡水等均四通八达。邯郸大华公司汽车修理厂，已于冀南中心威县设立汽车站，该处民用客车早于三月间通行，客商来往不绝，莫不称便。全区电话以威县为中心有六条干线通各分区，全长八百九十华里。各个区亦各修好很多支线，共长一千八百五十三华里，共设总机七部，分电机二十部。目前各地互相联系日益密切，这将有助于全区和平建设事业的顺利发展。
    邮政方面：邮务工作现全区四十三县均建立，改进了干线，设立了邮线网，加强了下层，克服了过去城市快农村慢的缺点，真正作到为人民服务并保证了报纸发行迅速准确。关于德石铁路的恢复，自我冀南五专署与冀中六专署联合组成德石路管理局，教育群众爱路护路等工作已获得很大成绩，现仍继续开展中。
    冀南卫河、滏河历来航运发达，多少万船夫依靠运输维持生活，但这几年来由于敌人的分割封锁，又组织所谓“河运”抽征“百货税”“落地税”等，以至船夫失业。和平后民主政府积极恢复水利组织船贷款（邯郸贷出三十余万元），修理残破船只，滏阳河上现已修好船只邯郸有三十二只，衡水有四只，张桥有三十只，均已通航。现南起邯郸，中经邢家湾、衡水，北至张桥、五百里的滏阳河面上，船只上下络绎不绝。滏河下运多是煤炭，截至目前运数已达卅万斤。运河北运棉花为主，许多船夫不但复业，生活也得到改善，据调查每只船上水七天走到，载重最少三万斤；下水三天走到，载重最少七万斤，除去六、七天人的开消，每船至少可赚十余万元。目下准备入津，惟中途有伪军阻碍通行，为保护运输安全，必须立即解除伪军武装。
    【本报阳城讯】太岳区半年来在公路、铁路、邮政三大工作的恢复与建设上成绩显著：（一）公路建设。修复了共长九百八十余华里的临汾屯留、曲沃高平、晋城翼城、济源垣曲、翼城绛县等五大公路。临屯公路（一百四十四公里）与晋翼公路（一百三十九公里）的路基，于六十六天内修复，并架设桥梁四十七座。因交通工具缺乏，只有曲高、晋翼、翼绛三条公路通车。
    （二）铁路建设。同蒲线蒙城至水头段全长一百八十华里。由在晋南“恢复交通委员会”统一领导及蒙水段铁路管理局努力下，已全部勘察完竣，并拟就修复计划，只因敌伪破坏，路轨不足，器材损失严重，需工浩大，加以国民党扩大内战行为影响兴修，至今未能动工。
    （三）邮政建设。太岳邮务管理局下设几个分局，三十五个县局，二十八个干线站，邮寄干线五条，支线十六条，全长三千五百零五里。特别在乡村邮寄工作上成绩显著。乡邮干支线共有四百一十六条，长约一万八千八百五十五里，其间有乡邮站一百三十五个，代办所四十四个，转递站二千五百一十一个，分布在干支线上，作为连络点，使半年来邮寄工作未受任何阻碍。
