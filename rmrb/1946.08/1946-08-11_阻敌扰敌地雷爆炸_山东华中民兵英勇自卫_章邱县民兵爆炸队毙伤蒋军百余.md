Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 6th: Militias in various parts of the Shandong Liberated Area are cooperating with the main forces to block the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops in order to defend their peaceful and democratic happy life. In the Lucentral District, tens of thousands of militias in Boshan and Shou Counties, more than 1,800 miners in the Zibo mining area, and more than 700 employees of the Shentou Electric Power Company are actively展开ing activities near the mining area. The Zhangqiu County militia Li Yuquan explosives team has killed and wounded more than 130 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in several explosions. On the 16th of last month, Li Yuquan led his team to set up a minefield on the road where Chiang Kai-shek's troops were advancing north of Shilipu Village (west of Longzhuang Station on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway). When a company of the 12th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops passed nearby that day, the militia immediately used firepower to force the Chiang Kai-shek troops into the minefield. Suddenly, a series of mines exploded, killing all 30-plus Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. In the Qiunan District, when Chiang Kai-shek's ×× Army attacked Yixian and other places in the Liberated Area on the 19th of last month, the militia formed a self-defense joint defense team and carried out elusive guerrilla warfare day and night, fighting 12 times in three days. On the 21st of last month, when a company of the 37th Division of the said army invaded Zhangzhuang, more than ten li north of ××, the Zhangzhuang militia laid mines on one side and fired volleys suddenly, and then blocked the enemy separately, forcing the invading army to flee back. The militias in various places said with great confidence: "This time we have the opportunity to go to the front line to exchange for better guns."
Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 5th: Militias in the Central Jiangsu and Northern Anhui Liberated Areas are bravely participating in the self-defense war. On July 17, the Jingjiang militia in the First Sub-district attacked Qianjiashi, an important town northeast of Jingcheng occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and rescued more than 1,000 citizens detained by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Four thousand militias on the Yang (zhou) Tai (zhou) line in the Second Sub-district launched assaults on the Yi (Zhou northeast fifty li) to Zhutou (Zhou northeast sixty-five li) line, destroying 25 li of roads, two bridgeheads, and one blockhouse, delaying the advance of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. On the 15th of last month, the Kuomintang township chiefs of Sunjiazhuang, Qianjiazhuang and other places in Qintong County of the district led "self-defense teams" to harass the edge of the Liberated Area. They were severely attacked by the local militia. After 20 minutes of fierce fighting, four rifles were seized, two of which were American-made. The militia in the Shitou District of Binghui County (renamed from Tianchang) in the Third Sub-district organized combat platoons to the front line, and defended the three Litou more than ten li south of Binghui, blocking the fierce attack of Chiang Kai-shek's troops for a whole day and night. Since Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied the entire Liberated Area west of the Huainan Road in the Fourth Sub-district, the local militia has persisted in the self-defense struggle, and has recovered Hongxinfu, Xiaoxihe Station in Fengyang County, and Caojiadian and other places in Dingyuan County, seizing dozens of guns and eliminating more than 70 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. The Central China Military Region specially issued an order to commend the heroic self-defense actions of the people in various places.
