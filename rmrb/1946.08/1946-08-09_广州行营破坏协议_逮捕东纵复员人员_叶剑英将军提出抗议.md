　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Communist Party Committee Member Ye Jianying of the Beiping Military Mediation Department recently protested to the Kuomintang authorities regarding the unreasonable forced "training" of demobilized personnel from the East River Column by the Kuomintang Guangzhou Headquarters. It is understood that the Guangzhou Headquarters ordered demobilized personnel from the East River Column to report to the Political Department of the Headquarters within a specified date, otherwise they would be charged with violating government orders, and dispatched a large number of police and constables to arrest them according to the demobilization roster and addresses. Committee Member Ye believes that this action is a concrete manifestation of the Kuomintang authorities' deliberate sabotage of the agreement on guaranteeing the safety of demobilized personnel when the East River Column withdrew north.

　　广州行营破坏协议
    逮捕东纵复员人员
    叶剑英将军提出抗议
    【新华社延安三日电】北平军调部中共委员叶剑英近为国民党广州行营无理强迫东江纵队复员人员“集训”事，向国民党当局提出抗议。据悉：广州行营于指定日期内限令东江纵队复员人员向行营政治处报到，否则以违犯政府命令论罪，并出动大批警宪，按照复员名册及地址加以逮捕。叶委员认为此举系国民党当局有意破坏东江纵队北撤时关于保障复员人员安全等项协议的具体明证。
