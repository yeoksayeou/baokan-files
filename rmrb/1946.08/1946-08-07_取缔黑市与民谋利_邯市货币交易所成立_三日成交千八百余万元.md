　　Suppressing the Black Market to Benefit the People
    Handan Currency Exchange Opens
    Transactions Totaling Over 18 Million Yuan in Three Days
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 30th] The Handan Currency Exchange held its opening ceremony yesterday (29th) at 9:00 AM, officially opening for business at No. 122, west end of Heping Road, east of the main street (the former site of the Jinnan Bank). The venue was filled with representatives from various industry associations and banks, as well as brokers. Citizens were also densely packed outside the counter. After the opening, Director Ma Yourong of the Exchange explained, "Under the leadership of the democratic government, all trade that benefits the broad masses of the people is free. Under the government's policy of controlling foreign exchange, gold, silver, Customs Gold Units, and French currency, through brokers, prices are made transparent at the Currency Exchange. Trading currencies is completely free in the Currency Exchange. You can sell for whatever price you want, as long as someone buys it. The Exchange does not restrict prices." When Vice Mayor Feng of Handan was invited to speak, he emphasized, "The establishment of the Exchange is to eliminate the black market. The black market is illegal and not transparent. This kind of black market not only affects merchants but also affects the lives of the broad masses of the people. For example, in the black market, those who want to buy cannot buy, and those who want to sell cannot sell. Through those rogue 'runners,' buyers pay high prices, and sellers get low prices, with significant exploitation in between, which leads to high prices and affects the lives of the broad masses of the people. To take care of the interests of all merchants and the lives of the broad masses of the people, the Currency Exchange was established. In the Currency Exchange, currencies can be freely traded, and the government will never restrict it. If you do not trade in the Exchange and engage in the black market, you are violating policy, and the government will severely crack down on it." After Chairman Wang Jingran of the Exchange reported on the establishment process following Vice Mayor Feng's speech, he explained the rules of the Currency Exchange: "The Exchange also posts prices, but not in advance. There is a morning session and an afternoon session. The prices of transactions in the morning are posted at 12:00 PM, and the prices of transactions in the afternoon are posted the next morning, indicating the highest and lowest amounts. Brokers usually operate, but do not set prices privately below. At the opening of the session, prices can be raised or lowered according to the market. Transactions are made in the Exchange market. The Exchange welcomes transactions, welcomes visitors, and welcomes listening to market prices. If the market is right, sell; if not, don't. Brokers are only allowed to charge a 1% commission, with 30% of that 1% going to the public and 70% going to private. Those who do not want to be named in the transaction can entrust it to a broker. Brokers must implement policies and must not engage in secret market deals. If they do, they will be dealt with according to the law." Chairman Wang finally hoped that the people of the city would supervise the brokers, and the brokers would supervise each other, to ensure the benefit of all merchants and citizens. After the representative of the Commercial Federation spoke, trading began immediately. People inside and outside the counter stopped their fans and listened to the announced prices. Some made deals on the spot if the prices matched, and some didn't if they didn't match. As a result, each broker completed at least one transaction. Even after the time was up, everyone was still competing to make deals. (Farmer)
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 1st] Since its establishment, the total transaction value of the Handan Currency Exchange has been increasing day by day. The total value of the past three days is announced as follows: The first day (29th), the total value at the end of the morning and afternoon sessions was 2,901,048 Jicha Yuan. The second day (30th), the morning session was extended from the stopping time of 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and the afternoon session was extended from the stopping time of 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM, with a total value of 9,251,909 Jicha Yuan. The third day, the morning session was the same as the first day. In the afternoon, to take care of the staff's energy, it was only extended to 7:30 PM, but it still reached a total of 7,849,930 Yuan. (Farmer)

　　取缔黑市与民谋利
    邯市货币交易所成立
    三日成交千八百余万元
    【本报邯郸三十日讯】邯郸市货币交易所于昨日（二十九）上午九时，在和平马路西大街东头路南门牌一二二号（冀南银行旧址）举行开幕仪式，并正式开张营业。席间，坐满了各业公会、各银行的代表及经纪人，柜台外边参观市民亦十分拥挤。开幕后，该所马主任幼龙首先说明：“在民主政府领导下，一切于广大人民有利的贸易都是自由的，在政府管制外汇的政策下，赤金、白银、关金、法币等，经过经纪人，使价格在货币交易所明朗化，在货币交易所中，交易货币完全自由，卖多大价都可以，只要有人买就算成交。交易所不限制价格。”邯郸市冯副市长被邀讲话时，着重说明：“贸易所的成立，就是为了取消黑市。黑市是不合法的，不公开的，这种黑市不仅影响了商人，也影响了广大人民生活。例如在黑市中，愿买的买不到，愿卖的卖不出。经过那些流氓“跑合”的，买的出个大价钱，卖的得个小价钱，中间被他们剥削很大，于是使物价高涨，影响了广大人民的生活。为了照顾所有商人的利益和广大人民生活，所以有货币交易所的成立。在货币交易所中，货币可以自由成交，政府绝不限制，如果不在交易所交易，实行黑市，就是违犯政策，政府一定严加取缔。”该所王静然理事长继冯副市长报告了成立经过后，说明货币交易所的规矩：“交贸所也挂牌，但不是先挂牌，而是上午一场，下午一场。上午成交的价格，到十二点挂出牌，下午成交的第二天早晨挂出。并标明最高额和最低额。经纪人平常活动，但是在下边不要说定价格，到开场时，再按行情愿提高就提高，愿降低就降低。在交易所的市场上成交。交易所欢迎成交，欢迎参观，欢迎听行情。行情对了就卖，不对作罢。如你出三五，他出三六，而他出三四，卖家就可以卖给三六的。经纪人只准抽百分之一的手续费，这百分之一的手续费的十分之三交公，十分之七归私。不愿出名买卖者可委托经纪人代办。经纪人必须执行政策，绝不能吃暗行市，如果吃了暗行市，就依法办理。”王理事长最后希望全市人民监督经纪人，经纪人也互相监督，以保证有利全体商人和市民。在商联会代表讲话后，立刻进行交贸。柜台里外的人们都把驱热的蒲扇停下来，倾听着他们宣布价格。有的双方合适了就当场成交，不合适就不成交，结果每个经纪人最少都成交了一件以上。直到时间过了，大家还都在争着成交。（农）
    【本报邯郸一日电】邯郸市货币贸易所自成立以来，成交总值一天比一天多，兹将三天来总值公布如下：第一天（二十九）上下午按时结束总值冀钞二九○一○四八元，第二天（三十日）上午由停止时间十一时延长至十二时，下午由停止时间六时延长至九时总值冀钞九二五一九○九元，第三天上午与第一天同，下午为了照顾工作人员精力，仅延长至七时半，亦达总七八四九九三○元。（农）
