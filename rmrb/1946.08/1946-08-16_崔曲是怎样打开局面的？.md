How Did Cuiqu Open Up the Situation?

Cuiqu is a village in the second district of Handan that has done relatively well in its work. As early as 1941, we had secret anti-Japanese work there. In May of last year, a struggle was launched to settle accounts with An Yugui, the local tyrant landlord and pseudo-cooperative director. After the liberation of Handan, land was returned and capital was increased. The well-digging expenses of several landlords were settled. Various village organizations were established, and most of the cadres had been engaged in underground struggle for several years. However, the masses had not been mobilized.

When the comrades of the Turn-Over Team first arrived in this village, the cadres generally expressed complacency, believing that there were no major issues in the village, that the main landlords had already been struggled against, that the land had been obtained, and that various organizations were in place, and that everyone had been emancipated. As for whether they were thoroughly emancipated, everyone felt that there was no definite standard. Some cadres said: "It's like drinking water. We were very thirsty in the past, and now we've drunk a bowl and feel settled. It's hard to say whether we're still thirsty or not." Others, although they felt dissatisfied, didn't dare to mention it, doubting whether they could struggle again, or whether it would be excessive. The masses generally expressed dissatisfaction, believing that they were far from being emancipated, and had only "flexed a muscle" without really stretching out. Further struggle was not possible, as the landlords were still better off, and they didn't dare to turn over without orders from above.

The reasons for this phenomenon are mainly that the leadership in the past was too restrictive, setting many boundaries for the masses: such as retaining components, retaining landlords as rich peasants, and rich peasants as middle peasants, on the grounds that landlords don't know how to work and should have enough property to hire long-term laborers; not thoroughly settling accounts, as thorough settlement is equal to egalitarianism (i.e., compensating with all property); not completely overthrowing them in one struggle, leaving some opinions for future struggles; not struggling too fiercely, so as not to frighten the landlords in other villages; if the struggle is excessive, the fruits should be returned, so it's better to struggle less at first. Due to these many restrictions, six landlords were struggled against, and the original compensation of 5.25 million was reduced to 1.33 million under orders from above. On one occasion, the masses had already reduced the amount as ordered, but the comrades of the special commissioner's office still felt it was too much and wanted the masses to reduce it further. When reducing, the landlord's total property was not taken into account, only the landlord's land. As a result, the landlord took out money without selling much land. The six landlords who were struggled against originally had 1,184 mu of land, but only 324 mu were sold, and some were still retained as landlords. Secondly, under the influence of the restrictions imposed by the higher-level leadership, the village cadres monopolized everything, and only struggled at cadre meetings. After calculating and reducing everything, they would announce it to the masses and pass it as usual. The struggled against not only did not bow their heads and admit their mistakes in front of the masses, but the masses also did not see their own strength. Thirdly, in the distribution of the fruits of struggle, those who were wronged and offered opinions only received a small reward, while the village cadres received the most; when buying land, the cadres also rushed to the front. Therefore, many people complained: "It's the same to get money without giving opinions as everyone else, and we don't offend anyone. Why should we give opinions?" The money used to establish cooperatives from the struggle funds was not used for production, but only solved the difficulties of a few people. The fruits of past struggles were still delayed in distribution, and the accounts were never made public. In addition, the cadres did not approach the masses and had a bad attitude, which created a gap between the cadres and the masses.

Based on the above situation, the comrades of the Turn-Over Team decided to strengthen the education of cadres, review past work, break the shackles, and inspire the spirit of struggle; to clean up the fruits of struggle, improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, and continue to go deep into the masses, understand the situation, and inspire struggle. In reviewing the past work, the general village cadres easily accepted it, but when proposing to clean up the accounts and improve relations with the masses, some cadres resisted. At that time, some cadres in nearby villages were dismissed and detained for corruption and degeneration, and some bad elements in this village were also using various excuses to provoke the masses. Therefore, they believed that cleaning up the accounts was mainly to find their mistakes, that the bad elements had succeeded in provoking, and that they would lose face. Therefore, they launched complaints, worked negatively, and were emotionally opposed to the comrades of the Turn-Over Team, and it was difficult to explain it at the time.

At this time, An Yugui, the object of struggle who had fled in the past, returned. The comrades of the Turn-Over Team realized that it was easy to cause internal disputes by only cleaning up internal problems, and that internal problems could only be solved in the struggle against the outside. Therefore, they decided to detain An Yugui and focus on arranging the struggle. The first step was to review the ideology of change of dynasty, which seriously affected everyone at that time, among the cadres and the masses, and then mobilize everyone to tell their grievances. In the middle of this process, the village cadres found that some good people were following the bad elements, not only could they not be mobilized, but they also gave opinions to the cadres, and everyone felt very distressed and had no way out. Therefore, the comrades of the Turn-Over Team once again proposed that the cadres review themselves, clean up the accounts, eliminate the rumors and provocations of the bad elements, and win over the good people. At this time, the cadres had personal experience and quickly accepted this opinion. Everyone realized that if one is not righteous oneself, one cannot correct others, and that reviewing and correcting oneself is not bowing one's head to the bad elements, but fighting against the bad elements. Therefore, the fruits that had not yet been processed were quickly distributed, and special compensation was given to the wronged households. The fruits obtained by the cadres were the same as those of the masses, and the accounts of the cooperative were also cleared. After such internal reorganization, the eyes of the masses had turned to the fighters, and everyone quickly reunited around the cadres. Later, after small grievance meetings and continuous networking, on the 28th of last month, the unprecedented mass grievance struggle meeting in Cuiqu Village was finally launched. From the detention of An Yugui to the opening of the meeting, it took thirteen days of preparation.

At the struggle meeting, twenty or thirty people told their grievances, and many people were unable to tell their grievances due to time constraints. Everyone jointly accused An Yugui of killing five people, including one of our militia captains, informing the enemy and arresting thirteen militiamen and anti-Japanese masses. One person who used to be An Yugui's pack mule was eventually sent to the enemy's prison. When everyone was telling their grievances, there was a burst of crying, which caused everyone in the audience to shed tears. When talking about An Yugui's meanness and oppression of the poor, everyone immediately took down the plaque "Charitable and Kind" on his door and threw it on the ground. Finally, the government responded to everyone's request and sentenced An Yugui to death and confiscated his property.

After the meeting, when asked if the cadres had any opinions in the village, they all excitedly said, "There are so many!" The masses said that they can now really stretch their grievances. During the meeting, many cadres and masses from other villages automatically rushed to participate. After the meeting, they all asked the comrades of the Turn-Over Team to quickly go to their villages to help with the work. Some villages, such as Beizhai Haozhuang, which was a relatively backward village, the cadres immediately and automatically detained the local tyrant landlord after returning and launched a struggle. Now, the nearby villages are generally surging into the struggle.

In opening up the work in Cuiqu Village, the main experience gained by the comrades of the Turn-Over Team is that in villages like Cuiqu, where we have had long-term work under the rule of the enemy and puppets, due to the lack of education in the past, coupled with the restrictions imposed by the leadership in the past, many problems will inevitably remain among the cadres, but they are basically good. Today, they should be encouraged to immediately lead the turn-over movement, and in the movement, they should be gradually educated and transformed through their own experience. Do not first clean up internal problems, as internal problems are not easy to solve at one time, but instead prevent the work from being carried out quickly.

### 崔曲是怎样打开局面的？

　　崔曲是怎样打开局面的？
    崔曲是邯郸二区工作较好的村庄，在一九四一年时就有我们的抗日秘密工作。去年五月间曾发动过斗争，向本村恶霸地主伪合作社长安玉贵算账。邯郸解放后，进行了回地增资，并向几户地主清算了敌人的打井款，村里各种组织建立了起来，干部大多是在地下斗争了好几年的，但是群众并未发动起来。
    当翻身队的同志刚到这村的时候，干部一般表示自满，认为村里没有啥大事了，几户主要地主已斗争过了，地也得了，各种组织也有了，大家已经翻身了。至于是否翻透，大家觉得没有一定的标准，有的干部说：好比喝水，过去渴得很，现在已喝了一碗心定了，一时说不上还渴不渴。有的虽然也觉得不满足，但不敢提，怀疑能否再斗，是否过火。至于群众则普遍表示不满，认为离翻身还远，只骨隆一下，还没有欠一欠身呢；再翻也不行，还是人家好过，没有上级命令不敢翻。
    造成这种现象的原因，主要是过去领导上束手束脚，给群众划定了许多范围：如保留成分，地主保留为富农，富农保留为中农，理由是地主不会劳动，应该让他有足够财产雇得起长工；不应彻底清算，彻底清算是均产（即将全部家产赔偿出来）；不应一次斗倒，留下几个意见以后好再斗；不要斗得太凶，把别的村庄的地主吓咆了；斗得过火了，要把果实倒回去，不如先斗得小一些。由于这许多限制，斗争了六户地主，原该包赔五百二十五万，在上级命令之下，减为一百三十三万。有一次群众已遵令减了，专署工作队的同志，还嫌多，又要群众减。减的时候，不以地主全部财产计算在内，只计算地主的土地，结果地主拿出了钱，并未卖去多少土地。被斗争的六户地主原有一千一百八十四亩，只卖去三百二十四亩，有的依然保留为地主。其次，在上级领导处处限制的影响之下，村干部包办一切，村干部只在干部会上来斗。算和减，一切弄好以后，才向群众宣布一下，照例通过。被斗争者既不到群众面前低头认过，群众也看不到自己的力量。第三，在分配斗争果实时，被屈而提意见的人只得少数奖励，村干部反分得最多；买土地时，干部也抢在前面。因此有许多群众抱怨说：“不提意见和大家一样分钱，又不得罪人，咱提意见干啥”。在斗争款里提出成立合作社的款，未进行生产，只给少数人解决了困难。过去斗争果实还有拖延未分的，账目都从未公布过。再加干部不接近群众，态度不好，因此造成了干部与群众间的隔阂。
    根据上面情形，翻身队的同志决定加强教育干部，检讨过去工作，打破束缚，启发斗争情绪；清理斗争果实，改善干部与群众关系，并继续深入群众，了解情况，启发斗争。在检讨过去工作中，一般村干部容易接受，但在提出清理账目，改善与群众关系时，有些干部就发生抵拒。当时附近村庄有些干部因贪污蜕化被撤职扣押，本村有一些坏分子也正在利用种种借口挑拨群众，因此他们认为清理账目，主要是找他们的错，坏分子挑拨成功了，自己要丢人，因此发起牢骚，工作消极，情绪上与翻身队的同志对立起来，一时解释不开。
    这时正好过去逃跑的斗争对象安玉贵回来了，翻身队的同志认识到仅只是清理内部问题，反容易造成内部纠纷，只有在大家一致对外的斗争中，才容易解决内部问题，因此决定把安玉贵扣起来，并把工作重点放在布置斗争上。首先是在干部与群众中检讨当时严重影响大家的变天思想，进一步再发动大家诉苦，在这中间，村干部发现有些好群众跟随着坏分子走，不仅动员不起来，反而对干部提意见，大家感到很苦恼，没有办法。于是翻身队的同志再度提出干部检讨自己，清理账目，消灭坏分子造谣挑拨借口，争取好群众。这时干部有了切身体验，很快接受了这个意见，大家认识到己不正不能正人，检讨与改正自己，不是向坏分子低头，正是向坏分子作斗争。于是迅速分配尚未处理的果实，对被屈户特别予以包赔，干部所得果实与群众一样，又清算合作社账目等，经过了这样内部的一些整理，群众眼光已转到斗争者身上，大家迅速团聚到干部周围了。以后经过诉苦人小会，以及不断的串连，终于在上月二十八日展开了崔曲村前所未有的群众的诉苦斗争大会。从扣起安玉贵到开大会，前后经过了十三天的酝酿时间。
    在斗争大会上，诉苦的有二三十人，有许多人因时间关系未能诉。大家共诉出安玉贵害死五条人命，内有我民兵队长一人，向敌人告密捕去民兵及抗日群众十三人，有一个原是一贯给安玉贵当驮脚驴的，最后不免也被送进了敌人的牢狱。大家在诉苦时，一片哭声，引起全场落泪，在诉及安玉贵刻薄欺压穷人时，大家当场把他门上“乐善好施”的匾撤在地下。最后政府答复大家要求，对安玉贵处以死刑并没收财产。
    会后，当问及干部村里还有啥意见时，都兴奋的说，“可多哩”！群众则表示，现在可以好好伸伸冤了。开会时，有许多自动从外村赶来参加的干部及群众，会后都要翻身队同志赶快到他村去帮助工作，有的村子，如北寨郝庄，原是较落后的村子，干部回去后立即自动将恶霸地主扣起来，进行了斗争。现在附近村庄，正普遍涌进斗争中去。
    在打开崔曲村的工作中，翻身队的同志获得的主要经验是像崔曲这样在敌伪统治下即有我们长期工作的村庄，由于过去缺乏教育，再加过去领导上束手束脚，必然在干部中会存留很多问题，但基本上是好的，今天应该鼓励他们立即领导翻身运动，在运动中再以他们自身的经验逐步加以教育改造，不要首先来清理内部问题，那样内部问题既一时不易解决，反使工作不能迅速展开。
