Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd. The Kuomintang secret agents, in plain clothes, numbering many, suddenly broke into the guard unit of General Feng Yuxiang in Xiaguan in mid-last month, shouting aggressively, "To arrest communists." Feng's guard battalion commander immediately assembled the troops and said to the agents, "Please search, and see who is a communist." The agents, seeing the situation was not good for them, then repeatedly said "misunderstanding, misunderstanding," and left swaggeringly. The citizens discussed it in the streets, and a atmosphere of terror enveloped the whole city.
