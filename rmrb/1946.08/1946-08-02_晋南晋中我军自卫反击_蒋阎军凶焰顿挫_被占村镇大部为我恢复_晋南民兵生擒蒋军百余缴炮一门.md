Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng, 29th: In recent days, the Chiang-Yan troops attacking southern Shanxi and along the Tongpu Railway have suffered setbacks due to the local Eighth Route Army's self-defense counterattacks. Many important market towns and villages have been recovered, and the invading troops' ferocious advance has been halted. They have now retreated to a narrow area along the railway. In southern Shanxi: On the 21st, a regiment of the Chiang army's 78th Division, which had occupied Songdian Station southwest of Wenxi, attacked the Eighth Route Army in Songcun village south of Wenxi under the cover of five aircraft. The 47th Division, stationed at Guodian Station, also attacked the Eighth Route Army defenses in Zhongjin and Xijin southwest of Wenxi. After fierce fighting, both attacking forces were completely defeated. On the 22nd, the Yan army, which had occupied Dongcheng in Quwo, continued to advance southwest, attempting to capture Gaoxian Station. They were repelled by the Eighth Route Army, which then seized the opportunity to recover Dongcheng and the surrounding areas of Bei＠ and Anding to the southeast. That afternoon, the Eighth Route Army continued to recover Donggao Village, Xigao Village, Zhangwang Village and other places east of Quwo that had been occupied by the Yan army. Along the Tongpu Railway in Jiexiu and Pingyao: On the 16th, more than 1,500 men of the Yan army's 44th Division, who had re-occupied Baohe and Wangguo in Jiexiu County, continued to invade Zhangbi and other places on the 20th. The Eighth Route Army rose up in self-defense and completely defeated them, and Baohe, Wangguo and other places were subsequently recovered. On the 23rd, the defeated Yan army's 44th Division, after receiving reinforcements, launched a fierce attack on Hongshan, Liujiashan, Songbi and other places (all northeast of Jiexiu). The Eighth Route Army counterattacked village by village, inflicting heavy losses on the Yan army. That night, they fled back to Jiexiu city in a panic. At the same time, the Yan army occupying Dongquan Town and Yuebi in Pingyao were also repelled by the local masses and the Eighth Route Army in self-defense, and these areas have also been recovered. On the 17th, the Yan army's 207th Regiment of the 69th Division and the 3rd Regiment of the 44th Division attacked Jinzhen and Xiasanjiao in Huoxian County. On the 19th, they continued to attack Songzhuang and Beibi, but were met head-on and repelled by the local Eighth Route Army.

This newspaper Yangcheng, 29th: The Eighth Route Army in southern Shanxi, in conjunction with the local people, has recovered most of the areas occupied by the Kuomintang army after more than 20 days of heroic self-defense operations. In addition to 47 villages and towns along the Wenxi-Shuitou line, including Shuitou, Caozhang, Songdian, Yimen, Hancun, Songcun, Wulitou, Wenxi city, Xiangshan Temple and Guanzhuang east of Wenxi city, and Qilitou northwest of the city, we have completely recovered the area east of this line. Along the Zhangmao Highway, our local troops and militia have carried out self-defense counterattacks, and we have recovered more than 100 villages on both sides of the line. Ducun, Macun, Dongpingtou and other places in Pinglu, which were occupied by the Chiang army in March, have also been liberated. In this self-defense operation in southern Shanxi, the militia of Wenxi and Xiaxian demonstrated infinite bravery in defending their homes and cooperating with the Eighth Route Army. In 20 days, the militia captured more than 100 invading Chiang soldiers alive, seized 110 rifles, one mortar, and a large amount of ammunition and livestock.
