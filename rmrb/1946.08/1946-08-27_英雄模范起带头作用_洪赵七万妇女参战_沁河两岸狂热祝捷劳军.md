　　Heroic Models Take the Lead
    Hong Zhao 70,000 Women Participate in the War
    Frenzied Celebrations and Troop Support on Both Banks of the Qin River
    [Our Yangcheng Dispatch] In this self-defense war, 70,000 women in Hongdong and Zhaocheng contributed tremendous strength, undertaking various logistical tasks. They formed stretcher teams, nursing teams, transportation teams, and propaganda teams, creating many heroic and exemplary deeds. Li Kejian, a model female teacher from Hongdong, and others ran to the battlefield and under artillery fire to work during the war, carrying wounded soldiers from the front lines. She often cared about whether the wounded soldiers' stretchers were comfortable and whether their pillows were properly placed, dedicating the enthusiasm she would have given to her husband and children entirely to the heroes of the patriotic war. One wounded soldier excitedly said, "To die for the people of Hongdong is the most valuable and glorious thing." Many women from Cao Sheng Village in Subao voluntarily joined the stretcher team. They said, "Now is wartime, not a time for family." Zhao Zhenying, a military dependent from Cao Sheng Village, whose father-in-law had a minor illness, said to people before leaving, "My father-in-law is sick, but the villagers can take care of him. I want to go to the front to serve those wounded soldiers." She led the female stretcher team from Cao Sheng Village quickly into the rear hospitals and transfer stations. The transfer stations in Zhoubi, Subao, Hongdong, and Hetou, Zhaocheng, were entirely staffed by women. Two women took care of each wounded soldier, providing water, food, laundry, and so on. Medical staff only handled medical work. The women's enthusiasm and care deeply moved the wounded soldiers, who said, "After recovering from our injuries, we will return to the front line and kill more enemies to repay your enthusiastic work." Some wounded soldiers were originally groaning in pain, but later, moved by their patient care and enthusiastic慰问, they turned from suffering to singing and laughter. An old lady named Fan Zongde from Cao Sheng Village had three of her four family members at the front. She stayed at home alone, making dry rations and boiling water for the front-line troops. Even the girls knew how much the patriotic war needed them. Li Anfei, seven years old, and Li Lanhua, eight years old, from Houhetou, also voluntarily sent firewood to the transfer station. Every day, many women brought eggs, noodles, and other items to the hospitals or transfer stations to comfort the wounded soldiers. Now, along with the men, they are carrying hoes and sweating to level the massive fortifications built by the Yan puppet troops.
    [Our Changzhi Dispatch] The people on both banks of the Qin River gathered to celebrate the great victory in the Meng County self-defense war in northern Henan, setting off a frenzied wave of support for the army and preparing for another self-defense war. Reception stations for marching troops, wounded soldier stations, and wounded soldier hospitals were set up on all the streets of Qinyang City, and women were competing to be volunteer nurses. Representatives of the county council, the county head, and the district chiefs formed a慰问团, carrying a large number of慰问品 and over 10,000 yuan in慰问金 donated by all sectors of society, to visit the hospitals on behalf of the people of the county. At the celebration meeting in Dahongqiao Village, Wuzhi, farmers, merchants, and women all spoke. The village chief said, "We were liberated when the Eighth Route Army came. The reactionaries want to harm us again. We must resolutely drive them back." The militia captain called on everyone to take up arms and fight the "wolves" (the local people's usual term for Chiang and his puppet troops), saying, "Only by driving away this group of 'wolves' can the people live in peace."
    [Our Handan Dispatch] The No. 1 Complete Primary School in Handan City responded to Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government's call to support the troops, and the whole school has launched a surge of troop support. Teachers, service staff, cooks, and orphaned and impoverished children left behind at school have all donated their accumulated salaries and wages to the soldiers fighting at the front. The female students are also rushing to make new clothes for the soldiers at the front overnight. In one day, the entire school donated a total of 717.5 jin of wheat, 100 jin of rice, 6.5 zhang of cloth, 2,452 yuan of Jicha, and a set of shoes and socks, and is preparing to launch a larger-scale troop support campaign after the start of the school year.

    【本报长治讯】沁河两岸人民纷纷集会，庆祝豫北孟县自卫战大捷，掀起狂烈的拥军热潮，并准备再次的自卫战争。沁阳城内各条大街均设立了行军招待所，伤兵站和伤兵医院，妇女们争做义务看护。该县县议会代表、县长及各区长，组成慰劳团，携各界捐赠之大批慰劳品和慰劳金万余元，代表全县人民奔赴医院慰问。在武陟大虹桥村的庆祝大会上，农民商人妇女都纷纷讲话，村长说：“八路军来了，咱们才翻了身，反动派又想来遭害咱，咱一定坚决把他打回去。”民兵队长号召大家拿起武器打“狼”（当地人民平时对蒋伪的称呼），他说：“只有把这群‘狼’赶走后，老百姓才能安心过日子。”
    【本报邯郸讯】邯郸市立第一完小响应边府戎副主席的劳军号召，全校已掀起了劳军热潮。教员、勤务员、炊事员和留校的孤贫儿童们，都把自己积蓄的薪金和工资，捐献给前方作战的将士。女同学更连夜为前方战士赶制新衣。一天内全校共献出麦子七百一十七斤半，米一百斤，布六丈五尺，冀钞二千四百五十二元，鞋袜一部，并准备开学后，掀起更大规模的劳军热潮。（赵寒）
