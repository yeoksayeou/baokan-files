　　Facilitating Military Personnel and Reducing Civilian Burden
    Wu'an City Establishes Unified Reception Center
    Implementation Should Be Studied and Implemented in Towns and Villages Along Major Roads

    [Reported by this newspaper] In view of the large number of military personnel passing through the city every day, the Wu'an County Government, in conjunction with the District Office, has decided to establish a unified reception center. This will facilitate the food and lodging of military personnel and reduce the burden on the people. Funds have now been allocated for the construction of housing, and 15,000 jin of wheat and 5,000 jin of millet have been allocated. In addition to receiving grain coupons and vegetable money, the shortfall will be covered by county funds and joint contributions from the streets of the urban area. According to research by the district, this approach should be implemented in major towns and cities along major roads. (Yifan)

　　便利来往军人减轻民负
    武安城设统一招待所
    沿大路村镇亟应研究实行
    【本报讯】武安县府鉴于城市每日来往军人很多，特协同区署商定成立统一招待所。既便于来往军人之食宿，又可减轻人民负担。现已拨款建筑住舍，并拨麦子万五千斤、小米五千斤，除收受粮票菜金外，不足之数，将来由县地方款及城关各街共同负担，据区上研究，此种做法亟应在沿大路之大乡镇及城内实行。（一帆）
