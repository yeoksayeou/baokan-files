　　Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 19th: Thanks to the conscientious effort to unite with middle peasants, the mass movement in Zhangbei County is vigorously unfolding. In Yiliang Village, Seventh District, there are a total of 191 households with over 900 people, of which middle peasants account for more than 60 percent. In the past, they were not united very well. Since July, the county leadership has reviewed this deviation and made practical corrections in the ongoing rent reduction and interest rate reduction campaign. When settling accounts with local despots Guo Yu and Liu Wanzhen, over 90 percent of the peasants participated, and the number of peasant association members expanded from 48 to 146. Furthermore, in Zhanghanyingzi Village, Fourth District, out of 118 households, 48 were middle peasants and 50 were poor peasants. During the liquidation of local tyrant Li Mingjiang, 104 households participated in the movement and received the fruits of victory, accounting for 96 percent of the village population. In Huangshiya, Seventh District, when settling accounts with local despots Luo Xikui and Jiao Jin'san, the participation of the masses reached over 95 percent of the total population. All 86 middle peasant households and 87 poor peasant households joined the peasant association, and the membership expanded by 205 people. After the victory of the liquidation, elderly, middle-aged, and women enthusiastically requested to join the peasant association, and the membership expanded to 210 people in one day, of which 86 percent were middle and poor peasant members.
