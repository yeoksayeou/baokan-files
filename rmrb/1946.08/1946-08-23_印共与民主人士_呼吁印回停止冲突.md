With the active support of Communist Party members, a moving "peace parade" was held by a large number of Hindu and Muslim party members in Calcutta on the 18th. A long procession paraded through the most violent areas, carrying the flags of both the National Congress and Muslim League at the front, often shouting: "Hindus and Muslims, protect the spirit of peace and friendship!" It is reported that the Muslim League leader has ordered the Muslims in Calcutta to stop the bloodshed.
