　　Tens of Thousands of Demobilized Soldiers from Jin-Cha-Ji
    Indignantly Defend Their Homes Against Chiang's Offensive
    Zhangjiakou Celebrates First Anniversary of Liberation with Enthusiasm
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 24th] The border region resolutely implements the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the troop reduction plan. More than 100,000 border region soldiers who gloriously returned to their hometowns, in light of the increasingly urgent attacks by Chiang's troops, are rising up to defend their homes. An Pang×, a demobilized soldier from Anzhuang, returned to his village in April. When his village was occupied by Chiang's troops, he immediately gathered a dozen village cadres and civilians to form a small armed force, conducting propaganda and organizing the masses for self-defense in nearby villages. He once led militiamen to destroy a Chiang's army bunker at a local farm and captured fifteen armed secret agents and smugglers. Li Gongzhan, a demobilized soldier, actively organized local mass armed forces to combat Chiang's and puppet troops' harassment and defend the masses after returning to his hometown in March. Zhang Xiuji, a 40-year-old veteran from Xiazhijing, Fanshi, followed the troops in fighting under the rain of bullets from the Yan's puppet army when the Eighth Route Army disarmed the puppet troops in Fanshi city a month ago, and successively seized two rifles and one Mauser pistol. He also actively helped train the village militia and encouraged young people to bravely join the war. Chen Xi, Ren Mingliang, and other demobilized soldiers from Shacheng, led fifteen young partners to the democratic government to request to go to the front line, and told their fellow villagers: "We originally hoped for peace, but now Chiang Kai-shek is attacking again, forcing us to no longer live in peace. You must intensify production and consolidate the rear as you did during the Anti-Japanese War, and we will go to the front." Wei Shoushan, a demobilized soldier from Peishan Village, joined the militia joint defense operations command, preparing to organize widespread mass guerrilla movements once Chiang's troops invade.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 25th] "August 23rd" is the first anniversary of the liberation of Zhangjiakou. On this day, all city agencies, factories, and schools broke with the usual holiday tradition and worked hard all day long. Mobilization rallies in each district to defend the liberated areas and support the front lines were held separately in the evening. In the Fourth District alone, more than 20,000 people attended, and at least 100,000 of the city's 170,000 residents participated in these rallies on this day. The news that Chiang's side openly and shamelessly declared that it would attack Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde universally aroused the people's indignation in all meeting places, factories, workshops, shops, streets, and alleys. A primary school teacher in the Third District said: "Last year on this day, the Eighth Route Army removed the shackles from our bodies. Under the leadership of the democratic government, we have united as one and built a free and prosperous city. Chiang Kai-shek is guilty of losing Zhangjiakou and has not contributed to the liberation and construction of Zhangjiakou. On what basis does he want to extinguish this beacon of peace? The people of Zhangjiakou resolutely will not allow the reactionaries' snouts to reach in." At the meeting in the Fourth District, many people requested on the spot to join the Eighth Route Army and go to the battlefield for self-defense. This righteous act immediately spread throughout the district. Merchants and residents of Wu Bao Street immediately elected representatives to raise a large number of comfort goods and sent them to the homes of soldiers and workers who joined the army amidst the sound of gongs and drums. At night, workers' self-defense teams, citizen patrol teams, and others from various factories carried weapons and conducted torch parades. Residents along the way set off firecrackers and fireworks to celebrate their liberation and welcome the marching columns. Radio broadcasts of speeches by Mayor Yang Chunpu and Chairman Xiao Ming of the General Labor Union called on all workers and citizens to urgently mobilize and defend this people's city. At 10 o'clock late at night, the crowds gathered in the streets had not yet dispersed.

    【新华社张家口廿四日电】边区坚决执行政协决议与整军方案，光荣复员还乡的十余万边区子弟兵战士，鉴于蒋军进攻日亟，纷起保卫乡里。安庄复员战士安滂×，今年四月返乡时，他村被蒋军侵占，他当即集合十几个村干群众，组成一支小型武装，在附近村庄宣传组织群众进行自卫。他曾领导民兵摧毁部农庄蒋军碉堡一座，捕捉武装特务和走私贩十五人。复员军人李公占，于三月份返乡后，即积极组织当地群众武装，打击蒋伪袭扰，保卫群众。繁峙下只井四十岁的退伍老战士张秀忌，在八路军月前解除繁峙城伪军武装时，随同部队在阎伪军弹雨下作战，先后缴到两支步枪和一支盒子枪，他并积极帮助训练村中民兵，鼓励青年勇敢参战。沙城复员军人陈喜、任明亮等，带领十五个青年伙伴，找到民主政府要上前线，并告乡亲们说：“原来指望和平，现在蒋介石又进攻来了，逼得我们不能再安乐生活下去，你们要和抗战时一样加紧生产巩固后方，我们到前方。”裴山村复员战士魏寿山参加了民兵联防作战指挥部，准备蒋军一旦进犯时，即组织广泛的群众游击运动。
