Taiyue Daily Publishes Editorial
Saluting the Military and Civilians on the Tongpu Front
[This newspaper, Yangcheng, 27th dispatch] Today, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily published an editorial titled "Saluting the Military and Civilians on the Tongpu Front." The editorial began by stating: Following the preliminary victory in southern Shanxi, our army in the central section of Tongpu launched a counterattack in mid-month, liberating Hongdong in the first battle, recovering Zhaocheng in the second, and recapturing Huoxian in the third. We now control over 170 miles of the central Tongpu line. Although the Chiang army had American planes for cover and was equipped with American weapons, once surrounded, they laid down their arms one after another. In the past month or so, the Chiang-Yan puppet troops annihilated and forced to lay down their weapons on the Tongpu front amounted to 11,000. The good news has boosted morale tremendously. It continued: The victory on the Tongpu front has significant meaning. Chiang Kai-shek successively transferred eight divisions of his army across the Yellow River, attempting to echo Yan Xishan from the north and south, to break through the Tongpu Road in one fell swoop, using it as a "blood transfusion line" for the civil war, and as a foundation for further large-scale invasions of the Liberated Areas to expand the civil war in Shanxi. After our repeated counterattacks, their fierce flames were initially thwarted. Now, more than two months later, not only has the railway south of Linfen failed to be opened, but the railway north of Linfen has been controlled by us for more than 170 miles, cutting off Chiang Kai-shek's "civil war blood transfusion line" and severing the direct connection between Chiang and Yan. Now, on the southern front, the areas temporarily occupied by the Chiang army are ablaze with guerrilla warfare everywhere. The Chiang army's situation is no different from the predicament of the Japanese who were trapped in bunkers in those years. On the northern front, our army is approaching the county of Lingshi, nearing the military stronghold of "Hanshin Ridge," dealing a head-on blow to Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to expand the civil war in Shanxi! The editorial pointed out that the Chiang army's expedition was unjustifiable, and the soldiers were weary of war and low in morale. Our troops, on the other hand, fight with grief and anger, and patriotic sentiment is at an all-time high, greatly improving combat effectiveness. In the Battle of Zhucun, Xia County, a single squad annihilated 170 Chiang soldiers in ten minutes. In addition, Chiang's army is rampant with secret agents everywhere, engaging in arson, murder, rape, and all kinds of evil deeds, including cutting open pregnant women and ripping out infants, which is utterly inhumane! Wherever their beastly hooves reach, the people flee, rising up in resistance. Now, the Chiang army in southern Shanxi is holding on to strongholds in units of regiments, and thirty to fifty people dare not come out at all. Our army, however, receives abundant support, and everyone supports the front. During the Hongzhao battle, 120,000 people were fully mobilized, launching a participation competition, with 70,000 women rushing to the front to carry stretchers, transport supplies, and care for the wounded, truly forming a patriotic national mobilization. In contrast, the Chiang army is deep in enemy territory, with difficulty in supply. Relying solely on robbery is a drop in the bucket and does not help the situation. Chiang's soldiers complain to each other about not having enough to eat, and anti-war and war-weary sentiments are overflowing in the army. This is a major crisis facing the Chiang army in southern Shanxi!
    The editorial concluded by pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek is continuing to increase troops crossing north, and the situation in southern Shanxi is still very tense. We should firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "guarding against arrogance and rashness," respond to the recent call of the Central Bureau, be neither arrogant nor slack, make persistent efforts, carry forward the glorious example of the Tongpu campaign, strive for greater victories, defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, and fight for the independence, peace, and democracy of the whole country!

    向同蒲前线军民致敬
    【本报阳城廿七日电】今日太岳新华日报以“向同蒲前线军民致敬”为题，发表社论，该社论首称：继晋南初步胜利之后，同蒲中段我军，于本月中旬，展开反击，一战解放洪洞，再战恢复赵城，三战光复霍县。控制同蒲中段一百七十余里。蒋军虽有美机掩护，美械装备，但一经包围，则纷纷放下武器，月余来，同蒲前线蒋阎伪军被歼灭及被迫放下武器者，达一万一千之众，捷报传来，万众振奋。继称：同蒲前线的胜利，具有重大的意义，蒋介石先后抽调八师大军北渡黄河，企图与阎锡山南北呼应，一鼓打通同蒲路，将它作为内战的“输血管”，作为向解放区进一步大举进犯的依托，来扩大山西内战；经我一再反击，凶焰始挫，迄今时逾两月，不仅临汾以南铁路迟迟未能打通，而临汾以北的铁路，又被我控制一百七十余里，斩断了蒋介石的“内战输血管”，切断蒋阎南北的直接连系。现在南线方面，蒋军暂时侵占的地区，到处燃起游击烽火，蒋军的处境，与当年日本人困守碉堡的窘况，并无两样。在北线，我军兵临灵石的县，逼近军事要冲“韩信岭”予蒋介石扩大山西内战的阴谋，当头一棒！该社论指出蒋军师出无名，士兵压战，士气低落；我们哀兵善战，爱国情绪空前高涨，战斗力大大提高，夏县朱村战斗中，十分钟内，一个班即消灭一百七十个蒋军。加以蒋军到处特务横行，烧杀奸淫，无所不为，剖胎割乳，惨绝人寰！兽蹄所至，人民逃避一空，群起反抗，现晋南蒋军，均以一团为单位，困守据点，三五十人根本不敢出来；而我军得道多助，人人支援前线，洪赵战役中，十二万人民，全体总动员，展开参战竞赛，七万妇女奔赴前线，抬担架、运输、照护伤兵、真正形成爱国主义的全民动员。反观蒋军孤军深入，接济困难，光靠抢劫，杯水车薪，无济于事，蒋军士兵相互埋怨吃不饱饭，反战厌战之情溢于军中，这是面临晋南蒋军的重大危机！
    社论最后指出蒋介石正在继续增兵北渡，晋南形势仍十分紧张，我们应紧紧记住毛主席“戒骄戒燥”的教训，响应中央局最近的号召，不傲不懈，再接再厉，发扬同蒲作战的光荣范例，争取更大的胜利，打垮蒋介石的进攻，为全国的独立、和平、民主而奋斗！
