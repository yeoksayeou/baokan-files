Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. Reuters, New York: Black people from forty-eight American states yesterday set up picket lines around the White House to protest the massacre of two black people in Georgia, and posted slogans everywhere, accusing the local government of violating Christian doctrine and being undemocratic. According to Ehrenburg's article "In America" (carried in Izvestia), white people in the southern states of the United States mostly have discriminatory ideas against black people, and some union leaders are even inciting workers to oppose black people. The most vehemently anti-black group is the American fascist terrorist group the Ku Klux Klan, whose members regularly abuse and persecute black people.
