　　Taiyue Our Army Liberates Huo County Town
　　Hongzhao Campaign Eliminates Over 5,000 Yan Puppet Troops
　　Jiang Army Occupies Empty City After People of Jiang County Evacuate

　　[This newspaper's Tongpu Front, 24th dispatch] The Taiyue Eighth Route Army, after recovering the cities of Hongdong and Zhaocheng, liberated Huo County town at 8:00 PM on the 23rd. Since the occupation of Huo County by the Yan puppet army's 44th Division (whose main force, the 3rd Regiment, was purely formed from puppet security forces), they implemented their so-called "soldiers and farmers as one," "credit grain purchases," and "apportioned grain purchases" policies, levying exorbitant taxes and levies, making the people unable to bear it. Recently, they even expanded their burning, killing, and looting to villages more than twenty miles away, causing extreme suffering to the masses. Responding to the demands of the county's 72,000 people, the Eighth Route Army, after capturing the outer strongholds such as Xinzhai Station in the county on the 14th, launched a general offensive on Huo County town at 8:00 PM on the 23rd, ending the battle in just 30 minutes, and Huo County town was liberated.

　　[This newspaper's Tongpu Front, 22nd dispatch] Xinhua News Agency Frontline Reporters Group comprehensive report: The battle results of Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and the battles of Liujiazhuang and Xinzhai Station in Huo County, and Wan'anzhen in Hongdong are as follows: (1) The Hongdong battle resulted in the capture of 330 rifles and carbines, 4 light machine guns, 1 heavy machine gun, more than 10 pistols, 26 train cars, 8 telephones, the capture of more than 700 Yan puppet soldiers, 20,000 shi of grain, 20,000 jin of edible salt, and the killing and wounding of more than 100 people, including the big traitor Zhang Niconglong. (2) The Zhaocheng battle resulted in the capture of 2 mountain guns, 4 light and heavy mortars, 4 heavy machine guns, more than 70 light machine guns, more than 60 pistols, more than 600 rifles and carbines, more than 20 telephones, more than 60 li of insulated wire, 4 radio stations, 1 locomotive, 8 train cars, more than 6,000 shi of grain, 2 cars, and the capture of more than 2,000 people (the previous report of more than 700 people was only those captured in the city), and the killing and wounding of more than 600 people. (3) The battles of Liujiazhuang and Xinzhai in Huo County resulted in the capture of 4 mountain guns (two of which were destroyed by the Yan army), 6 mortars, 4 heavy machine guns, more than a dozen pistols, more than 300 rifles and carbines, 20 grenade launchers and small cannons each, 1 telephone switchboard, more than 30 li of insulated wire, 39 mules and horses, 2 locomotives, the killing and wounding of more than 500 people, including Zhou Jianxiang, commander of the 69th Division, and Shi Liquan, commander of the 207th Regiment, and the capture of more than 600 people, including Pan Weizhou, deputy commander of the 207th Regiment. (4) In the pursuit battle west of the Hong and Zhao Rivers, Wan'anzhen (20 li northwest of Hongdong) and its surrounding strongholds were liberated victoriously on the 18th, capturing more than 400 people, including the chief of staff of the 39th Division, killing and wounding more than 400 people, and capturing more than 4,000 shi of grain. The Yan puppet strongholds along the Tongpu Road south from Gousancun in Linfen to Nanguan Town in Lingshi (excluding the Nanguan stronghold), a distance of more than 170 li, have been completely cleared.

　　[This newspaper's Tongpu Front, 22nd dispatch] The Jiang army, which occupied Hengshui, invaded our Jiang County town again at 1:00 PM on the 21st. Currently, they are coordinating with the Jiang army occupying Houma and the Quwo Yan security regiment to continue their invasion of the Qujiangyi Liberated Area. More than 1,300 Yan puppet troops from Quwo, on the 20th, launched an attack in three directions, advancing to Dongmazhuang, Sucun, Nanyang and other villages. After being surrounded by our army and having most of them wiped out, they fled back into the city in panic. At 1:00 PM on the 21st, two regiments of the Jiang army entered Quwo city from Aikou (35 li southwest of Quwo). The war in southern Shanxi is continuing to escalate. Note: Jiang County town was liberated by our army from the hands of the puppet army's Chen Niziwen on June 20th. This time, when the Jiang army invaded, all the people of the city unanimously evacuated outside the city, strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, forming a guerrilla group, and continuing the siege. Jiang County has become a dead city.

    【本报同蒲前线二十四日电】太岳八路军继收复洪洞、赵城两城后，复于二十三日午后八时解放霍县县城。霍县自阎伪军四十四师盘据后（该师主力第三团纯系伪保安队编成），实行其所谓“兵农合一”、“赊购粮”、“摊购粮”等政策，横征暴敛，民不堪命，近更扩张至二十里以外的村庄烧杀抢掠，群众痛苦异常。八路军接受全县七万二千人民之要求，于十四日攻克该县属辛置车站等外围据点后，二十三日下午八时向霍县城总攻，仅三十分钟即结束战斗，霍县城遂告解放。

    【本报同蒲前线二十二日电】侵占横水蒋军，二十一日下午一时又侵占我绛县城。现正配合侵占侯马蒋军及曲沃阎保安团，向我曲绛翼解放区继续进犯。曲沃阎伪军一千三百余人，于二十日分三路出犯，进占东马庄、苏村、南阳等村被我军包围消灭其大部后，仓慌逃窜城内。二十一日下午，蒋军两个团由隘口（曲沃西南三十五里）进入曲沃城内。刻晋南战争继续扩大中。按：绛县城系我军于六月二十日自伪军陈逆子文手中解放。此次蒋军进犯，全城人民一致转移城外，坚壁清野，组成游击集团，继续围困，绛县已成一座死城。
