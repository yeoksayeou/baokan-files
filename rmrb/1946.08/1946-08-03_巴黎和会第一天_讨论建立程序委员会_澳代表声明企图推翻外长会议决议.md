Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st - Moscow Radio reports: During the first day of the Paris Peace Conference, when discussing the establishment of a committee on rules of procedure for the conference, the Australian representative, Evatt, made an unfavorable statement attempting to overturn the resolution on rules of procedure prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Evatt's statement created a bad impression because he was playing rude tricks and was close to the main representatives of the Anglo-American group. (Note: Evatt, appearing as a representative of "small countries," demanded that the seventeen countries "should have the same rights as the four powers to finally decide on the treaty," and argued that this was a matter of principle of "great importance.") According to a United Press report: "Some other small countries' delegations take a not very important attitude towards the Australian representative's efforts. People close to Canadian Prime Minister King say that King is indifferent to Evatt's tactics. The Rules of Procedure Committee adopted at the first meeting consisted of one representative from each of the twenty-one countries. When discussing the committee's work on the 29th, Benes suggested that its first meeting should determine its own working procedures and meeting times. This suggestion was adopted. Benes has decided to send a representative to the first meeting of the Rules of Procedure Committee on the morning of the 30th. It is heard that Benes believes that the principle should be that motions in the peace conference should be passed by a two-thirds vote, but he also stated that he could change his mind at any time if the Rules of Procedure Committee could come up with a better suggestion. Evatt is still trying hard to win the principle of majority vote, rather than a two-thirds vote."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st - Various reports: On the second day of the Paris Peace Conference, the chief representatives of the United States, Britain, and China successively delivered speeches. In his speech, Benes particularly emphasized two points: first, the victors must strictly abide by the principles of guarantees and declarations they gave during the war. For example, when dealing with disputes over territorial claims, they must not forget the wording of the Atlantic Charter or try to limit their application; second, the victors should not impose such clauses that would only give reactionary elements in the defeated countries an opportunity to raise their heads, while depriving democratic forces of any opportunity to exist or consolidate. Benes also elaborated on the views of the US delegation on the military, territorial, political, and economic clauses of the draft treaty submitted to the conference for deliberation, as well as the issue of Italian colonies. British Prime Minister Attlee then spoke, stating: "Most of the tasks before you have been completed by the four powers. They have reached the greatest degree of agreement. We will voluntarily support them at this meeting." After Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's speech, the meeting approved the work of the Credentials Committee, reporting that all delegates' credentials were qualified. The meeting on the 31st will continue to discuss general issues, with speeches by representatives from Evatt, Brazil, and Belarus.

　　巴黎和会第一天
    讨论建立程序委员会
    澳代表声明企图推翻外长会议决议
    【新华社延安三十一日电】莫斯科广播称：当巴黎和会在第一天讨论关于建立会议程序规则委员会时，澳代表伊瓦特曾发表不好的声明，企图推翻外长会议所准备的会议程序规则决议。伊瓦特的声明发生了不好的印象，因为他在玩弄粗鲁的把戏，而是亲近依赖英美集团的主要代表（按伊瓦特以代表“小国”的面貌，要求十七国“应与四强同样权利以最后决定和约”，并辩称这是一个原则问题，有“极大重要性”。）据合众社报导：“其他一些小国的代表团，对于澳洲代表之努力，持不很重要的态度。接近加总理金氏之人士称：金氏对伊瓦特的策略冷淡。首次大会所通过之程序规则委员会，系由二十一国各派代表一人组成，当二十九日讨论该委员会工作时，贝纳斯建议其首次会议应决定其本身之工作程序及会议时间，此一建议获得通过，贝纳斯已决定于三十日晨派代表出席程序规则委员会的第一次会议。闻贝氏认为和会中议案应以三分之二的票数通过为原则，但是又表示程序规则委员会如能有更好之建议，他随时可以改变意见。伊瓦特则仍在极力争取大多数通过之原则，而非以三分之二通过为原则。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】各方报导：巴黎和会第二日，美英中首席代表相继发表演说。贝纳斯在演说时，特别强调两点：即第一、胜利者必须严格遵守战时他们给予的保证和声明的原则，譬如在处理领土要求的纠纷时，必须不能忘记大西洋宪章的辞句，或是设法限制他们的应用；第二，胜利者不应强加诸此种条款，即仅仅给予战败国家反动分子以抬头机会，而剥夺民主力量以任何存在或巩固之机会。贝纳斯并就提交大会研讨之和约草案的军事条款、领土、政治及经济条款及意大利殖民地问题，阐述美国代表团的意见。英首相艾德礼继起发言，艾氏声称：“诸位面前的大部任务已由四强完成了，他们已达到了最大程度的协议，我们在这一会议上将自愿地支持他们。”在中国外长王世杰演说之后，会议通过了代表资格审查委员会的工作，报告全体代表证书皆属合格。三十一日的会议，仍将讨论一般问题，将由伊瓦特，巴西与白俄罗斯的代表讲演。
