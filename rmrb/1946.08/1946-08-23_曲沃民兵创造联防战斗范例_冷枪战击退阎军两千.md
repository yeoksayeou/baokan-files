　　Quwo Militia Creates Model for Joint Defense Combat
　　Sniper Warfare Repels 2,000 Yan Troops
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng 19th dispatch] (Late Dispatch) The Quwo militia repelled 2,000 Yan troops, creating a model for joint militia defense combat. On August 1st, the Yan army's "Home Guard Regiment" in Quwo City, numbering over 2,000, surrounded the villages of Mazhuang, Changcun, and Xiyang in our Second District. When over a hundred Yan soldiers rushed into Changcun and surrounded the village militia, seven or eight militiamen, while firing their guns, escaped over the wall. After leaving the village, they organized sniper fire along the eastern ditch, less than a hundred steps away, preventing the enemy from pursuing. At this time, the militias of Xiyang and Ying villages, as well as the rotation combat teams, also discovered the enemy situation. Upon leaving the village, they engaged the Yan army. Our district cadres, comrades Yang Yuxiu and Liu Zhenhui, led everyone to break through the encirclement and occupy the high ground south of Balizhuang. The enemy concentrated their firepower and fiercely attacked our position. When the enemy approached within 30 to 40 meters, the militiamen's volley guns rang out, instantly killing two and wounding two Yan soldiers. The militias of Yimen, Beidong, and Jibi villages all automatically went to assist, setting up north-south battle lines and launching eight charges. Because the enemy outnumbered us, they switched to sniper warfare tactics, attacking the enemy, shouting slogans, and holding on until 3:00 PM, at which point the Yan army collapsed and retreated. It is estimated that five Yan soldiers were killed and over thirty were wounded. The militias of Upper and Lower Peizhuang also killed two and wounded one Yan soldier in another battleground.

　　曲沃民兵创造联防战斗范例
　　冷枪战击退阎军两千
    【本报阳城十九日电】（迟到）曲沃民兵击退阎军两千，创造了民兵联防战斗的范例。八月一日曲沃城阎军“保乡团”约两千余人，包围了我二区马庄、常村、西阳等村，当阎军百余人冲入常村包围了该村民兵时，七八个民兵，一面开枪射击，一面越墙脱险，出村以后，则在不足百十步远的东沟沿上组织冷枪射击，阻止了敌人的追击，这时我西阳、盈村民兵及轮战队，也发现敌情，出村便与阎军接触。我区干部杨玉秀、刘振惠等同志，带领着大家冲出了包围，占领了八里庄南的高地，敌人集中火力向我阵地猛攻，在敌接近我至三四十公尺时，民兵的排子枪猛响，一下打死了阎军两个，打伤两个。义门、北董、吉必村民兵都自动前去援助，摆了南北阵线，进行了八次冲锋。因敌众我寡，于是他们改用冷枪战法，打击敌人，进行喊话，坚持到下午三点钟，阎军遂溃退。计打死阎军五人，打伤三十余人。上下裴庄民兵在另一个战地还打死了阎军二人伤一人。
