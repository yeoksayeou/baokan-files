Chiang Kai-shek's Puppets Hou Ruyong and Wei Yonghe Bloodily Looted
Massacred Peaceful Residents of Yuanshi
Taihang District Party Committee Calls:
Turn Grief and Indignation into Courage to Avenge the Dead

[Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] (Delayed) Following the Qingxiu massacre in Wuxiang, on July 18th, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, led by the traitors Hou Ruyong and Wei Yonghe, committed another shocking massacre and frenzied looting in fifteen villages and towns in the Nansu and Wuzhuang areas of Yuanshi. At dawn on July 18th, the traitor Wei Yonghe, under the direction of the traitor Hou Ruyong, personally led more than 500 puppet troops from Yuanshi, combined with over 1,000 special agents and returning landlords, who were led by special agents from Wuzhuang and Wangcun, to surround fifteen villages and towns including Wuzhuang and Nansu in Yuanshi, which our army liberated last summer. They carried out wanton burning and killing, resulting in the sacrifice of seventeen cadres, masses, and militiamen, with three wounded and forty-eight cadres and militiamen captured. According to incomplete statistics, nine militiamen's rifles, sixty-four cattle, donkeys, and mules, eighty sheep, seventy-eight carts, and six carts of cloth and clothing were looted. Most of the pots, pans, furniture, and other items in the villages that were inconvenient to carry away were destroyed. In the Nansu militia captain Han Zhilu's family, six out of nine members were brutally killed. Han's wife was injured by a cart but survived. Han's younger sisters were terrified and collapsed in the pool of blood, Han's father hid upon hearing the sound, and was able to prevent his entire family from being harmed.

The traitor Wei Yonghe surrendered to the enemy in 1940, committing numerous evils. After the Japanese surrender, he was commissioned by Hu Zongnan as the 7th Brigade of the 1st Vanguard Column of the First War Area. He was commended by Chiang Kai-shek in February for his merits in the civil war's burning and killing. After the ceasefire agreement, he received ample ammunition supplies from Chiang Kai-shek and became even more intensified in his attacks, invading more than 200 times and occupying more than ten of our villages and towns. Recently, under the command of the traitor Hou Ruyong, he carried out this shocking massacre.

This heinous crime has aroused unparalleled anger among the military and civilians in the entire Taihang region. The First Sub-district of Taihang has issued an urgent call to the militiamen and masses of the sub-district, urging them to mobilize and resolutely oppose the massacre's perpetrator, Wei Yonghe, and avenge the dead fathers and brothers. They are also calling on the military and civilians of the entire region to express condolences and provide relief to the affected villages with cloth, cotton, and grain. The Taihang District Party Committee has also sent letters of condolence to the victimized people, pointing out that the massacre committed by the traitors Hou and Wei is closely linked to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war. At the same time, it pointed out that this is a sign of the last days of the fascist reactionaries, who, in the face of their doom, can only use special agent policies and fascist armed forces to brutally kill the people and suppress the patriotic movement of the people across the country to maintain their traitorous and dictatorial rule. The District Party Committee further called on the people of the entire region to turn grief and indignation into courage, raise vigilance, strictly investigate special agents and traitors, organize to defend the border areas, and avenge the dead.

　　蒋伪侯如墉魏永和血腥劫掠            
    屠杀我元氏和平居民   
    太行区党委号召：
    把悲愤变成勇敢为死者复仇
    【本报长治讯】（迟到）继武乡青修惨案之后，七月十八日蒋伪军侯如墉、魏永和两逆又在元氏南苏、武庄一带十五村镇制造了惊人的血腥屠杀疯狂掠夺的巨大惨案。七月十八日拂晓魏逆永和在侯逆如墉指使下，亲率元氏伪军五百余，结合特务还乡团共千余人，由武庄、王村特务带路，将我军于去夏解放之元氏武庄、南苏等十五村镇包围，大肆烧杀，干部群众民兵牺牲十七人，负伤三人，被俘去干部及民兵四十八人；据不完全统计，并被劫去民兵步枪九支，牛驴骡六十四头，羊八十只，大车七十八辆，布匹衣服六大车，各村不便拉走之锅碗家具等件大部被捣毁。南苏民兵队长韩之禄家九口人即被惨杀六口，韩妻负车伤未死，韩之小姊妹被吓倒在血泊中，韩父闻声秘藏，始免于全家被害。
    按魏逆永和系一九四○年投敌，作恶多端，日寇投降后，被胡宗南委编为第一战区先遣第一纵队第七旅，曾因内战烧杀有功，于二月间博得蒋介石传令嘉奖。停战协定后得到蒋介石充分的枪弹补给，乃更变本加厉，进犯益猛，先后出犯二百多次，占我村镇十余处，近更在侯逆如墉指挥下制造了此次惊人惨案。
    这一滔天罪行已引起我太行全区军民的无比愤怒。太行一分区特向该分区民兵、群众发出紧急号召，号召他们动员起来，坚决反对制造惨案刽子手魏永和，为死难父兄报仇；号召全区军民以布匹、棉花、粮食等慰问及救济被难村庄。太行区党委亦致函慰问被害人民；并指出侯、魏两奸制造此次惨案是与蒋介石卖国内战紧密联系着的，同时，指出这是法西斯反动派末日的表征，他们在死的厄运面前，只有用特务政策、法西斯武装残杀人民镇压全国人民的爱国运动，维持他们卖国独裁的统治。区党委继号召全区人民把悲愤变成勇敢，提高警惕性，严密清查特务奸细，有组织的保卫边地，为死者复仇。
