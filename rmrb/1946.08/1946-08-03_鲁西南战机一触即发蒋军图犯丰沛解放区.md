　　[Heze, 31st Dispatch] Chiang's army's deployment for a large-scale offensive against the Feng (County) Pei (County) liberated area north of the Longhai Railway has been fully completed as of the 30th. Our frontline reporter reports: This offensive is under the unified command of the Kuomintang Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and is divided into three routes: one directly attacks our Pei County from Xuzhou, one attacks our Feng County from Huangkou west of Xuzhou, and the third attacks Weiji, west of Feng County town, from Dangshan on the Longhai Railway. The advancing troops are deployed with local teams as the vanguard, followed by Chiang's army, attempting to use local teams to contain and exhaust our army, and then Chiang's army takes the opportunity to drive straight in. At the same time, Chiang's army is also collecting puppet troops and puppet organization personnel in Dangshan to organize a "Refugee Homecoming Corps" of more than 2,000 people, nominally organized into three groups: armed, stretcher-bearing, and transport. In reality, part of them are used as a source of replenishment for the army, and part of them are armed and infiltrate the liberated area to carry out assassinations and espionage. On the 27th, Wu Dongyi, Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, personally inspected the above-mentioned civil war deployment in Dangshan and expressed great satisfaction afterward.
    [Heze, 30th Dispatch] The Kuomintang army in northern Jiangsu is actively deploying to attack our Feng (County) Pei (County) liberated area in southwestern Shandong. On the morning of the 22nd, Feng Ziguo, Commissioner of the Ninth Special District of the Kuomintang in northern Jiangsu, arrived in Dangshan from Xuzhou and convened a meeting of the heads of the security teams of nearby provinces and counties to conduct civil war mobilization, proposing the slogan of "Northward Advance". The next day, more than 100 people from the "Xuzhou Refugee Homecoming Corps" organized by the Kuomintang also arrived at Jing'anji in southern Pei (County) from Xu, preparing to serve as the civil war vanguard for Chiang's army, which is about to invade Feng (County) Pei (County). In order to facilitate combat transportation, the Kuomintang army in northern Jiangsu began to build a highway between Xu (Zhou) and Jing (Anji) on the 22nd. All the summer crops, such as sorghum, on both sides of the highway were destroyed, resulting in a vast area of more than fifty miles from north to south and one mile from east to west, with no greenery at all. On the 23rd, the 88th Division of Chiang's army marched along the newly built highway to Jing'anji, Daxuzhuang, Xinweizi, and other places in the Feng (County) Pei (County) civil war battlefield. Wu Pinshan's unit of the First Column of the Pseudo-Jiangsu Advance Army was also transferred from Xinweizi to Chenzhuang, west of Xu. The Fourth Regiment of Geng Panxun's Fifth Sub-district Command of the Kuomintang Northern Jiangsu Suppression is also transferred from Chenzhuang to the Sanzilou area in the southeast of Feng County. The situation in Feng and Pei areas of northern Jiangsu is becoming increasingly tense.
    [Jiaozuo, 30th Dispatch] According to information obtained by our reporter: In the past few days, Chiang's army has increased its P47 air force units to 14 in Xinxiang and established an air force base in the suburbs of Xinxiang. A large number of aircraft bombs have also been gathered at the Xinxiang arsenal. The air force has been carrying out demonstrations and exercises for days, preparing to cooperate with ground troops to wait for an opportunity to attack our northern Henan liberated area. According to people from Xinxiang: Eight days ago, they witnessed Chiang's army using countless vehicles to rush through the streets to the arsenal. At that time, American personnel from the Xinxiang team happened to pass by the vehicles and immediately followed them to the gunpowder depot to check. They found that a large number of American-made bombs had been stored inside, and vehicles were loading bombs to the airport. Chiang's army's blatant violation of the Executive Headquarters' ceasefire order has been confirmed once again. The American personnel expressed great dissatisfaction, and Chiang's army could no longer quibble. According to other information: Chiang's army has transported a large amount of military supplies to Xinxiang from various places. Military vehicles transporting ammunition are frequent. Now, a large number of civilians are being forcibly conscripted. It is estimated that this is a new symbol of the offensive against our northern Henan liberated area.

　　鲁西南战机一触即发蒋军图犯丰沛解放区
    【荷泽三十一日电】大举进攻陇海线北丰（县）沛（县）解放区的蒋军部署，已于三十日全部完成。本社前线记者报导称：此次进攻，系由国民党江苏省保安司令部统一指挥，共分三路：一由徐州直攻我沛县，一由徐州以西之黄口攻我丰县，第三路由陇海线上之砀山攻我丰县城西之未集。进犯军兵力配署以地方团队作先头部队，蒋军尾随其后，企图以地方团队牵制疲惫我军，然后蒋军始乘机长驱直入。同时蒋军又于砀山大肆收集伪军伪组织人员，组织两千余人的“难民还乡团”，名义上编为武装、担架、运输等三组，实则一部除作为兵源补充外，一部则武装潜入解放区进行暗杀侦探。二十七日，国民党江苏省保安副司令吴东义亲至砀山检阅上述内战部署，事后并表示十分满意。
    【荷泽卅日电】苏北国民党军，正积极部署向我鲁西南之丰（县）沛（县）解放区进攻。二十二日上午，国民党苏北第九专区专员冯子固由徐州抵达砀山，召开附近省县保安团队长会议，进行内战动员，提出“北进”口号。次日国民党组织的“徐州难民还乡团”百余人，亦由徐到达沛（县）南敬安集，准备作为即将北犯丰（县）沛（县）蒋军的内战先导。苏北蒋军为便利作战运输，已于二十二日开始修筑徐（州）敬（安集）之间的公路，公路沿线两侧之高粱等夏苗全部被毁，致南北五十余里东西一里的广大土地上，已无一点绿色。二十三日，蒋军八十八师即沿新修公路，北开丰（县）沛（县）内战战场之敬安集，大徐庄、新围子等地，伪江苏挺进第一纵队吴品山部，亦由新围子调至徐西之陈庄。国民党苏北清剿第五分区指挥部耿盘勋之第四团，亦由陈庄调至丰县东南的三字楼一带，现苏北丰、沛一带形势已日趋紧张。
    【焦作卅日电】据本社记者获息：几日以来蒋军又增至新乡十四架Ｐ４７型空军部队，并在新乡城郊建立空军基地，新乡军火库亦结集大量飞机炸弹。空军连日示威演习，准备配合地面部队待机进攻我豫北解放区。另据新乡来人谈：前八天曾目睹蒋军以无数汽车，经大街驰往军火库，当时新乡小组美方人员适在汽车旁经过，立即跟踪追至火药库查看，发现里边已贮有大量美国制造之炸弹，并有汽车正装运炸弹至飞机场。蒋军如此公然违犯执行部停战命令之行动，再一次被证实。美方人员表示非常不满，蒋军亦无法再诡辩。另据信息：蒋军由各地运集新乡军火甚多，装运弹药之军用车，往来频繁，现又强征大批民夫。据估计：此乃对我豫北解放区进攻的新象征。
