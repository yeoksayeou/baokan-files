Border Region Actively Builds Transportation: Adding Ferryboats to the Clear and Turbid Zhang Rivers
[Report from Handan] The Border Region authorities have allocated huge sums of money to actively build roads, and several main lines have been connected with neighboring areas: (1) The Shi (Jiazhuang) An (yang) highway, which runs through the hinterland of Jin, Hebei, Lu, and Yu, is about 500 li long. Seventeen bridges have been repaired, costing 80 million yuan. (2) The Han (dan) Lin (yi) highway is more than 1,300 li long, of which the Han (dan) He (ze) section alone cost more than 20 million yuan and 300,000 jin of grain. (3) The He (ze) Kai (feng) highway is about 400 li long. Since the completion of these roads, the border area can have smooth transportation with these areas, and the exchange of goods is uninterrupted. (Farmer)
[Report from Changzhi] Since its establishment, the Taihang Highway Administration has been actively preparing surveying tools, cement, machinery, and various road construction materials for highway construction. Two large ferryboats have now been built on the Clear and Turbid Zhang Rivers (they have already been launched and started working in the first ten days of this month). A ferry management committee has also been established to reform old sailors to ensure transportation during mountain floods. The Handan-Changzhi road expansion plan is being carried out in cooperation with the construction departments of various counties. More than 30 technicians and road workers have been dispatched to various sections for surveying. The section from Shexian to Piandian is planned to be rerouted to the river bank. All the projects will start after the masses finish hoeing seedlings.
[Report from Xingtai] The Border Region Highway Administration has recently allocated 450,000 yuan to build two large brick bridges at Gutuo Village and the north bank of the Qili River on the Pinghan Highway, which will be completed in the near future. By then, highway transportation will not be interrupted due to rising water in the rainy season. (Guo Yunjang)

　　边区积极建设交通清漳浊漳添设渡船
    【本报邯郸讯】边区当局筹拨巨款积极修筑公路，已有数条干线与各邻区修通：（一）贯穿晋冀鲁豫腹地的石（家庄）安（阳）公路，长约五百余里，修复桥梁十七座，用经费八千万元。（二）邯（郸）临（沂）公路长一千三百余里，其中仅邯（郸）荷（泽）一段即开支两千余万元及三十万斤粮食。（三）荷（泽）开（封）公路，长约四百里。自此等公路修通后，边区可与各该区的交通畅达，货物交流不息。（农）
    【长治讯】太行公路管理局自成立以来，积极准备测量工具、洋灰、机器及各种筑路器材，从事公路建设，现已造成清浊两漳大渡船两只（本月上旬已下水开始工作）。又成立了渡口管理委员会，改造旧水手以保证山洪暴发时的交通运输。邯长路展修计划正与各县建设科协同进行，三十余个技师及路工已分赴各段进行测量，涉县至偏店段拟改道于河岸之上，全部工程将在群众锄苗结束后兴工。
    【邢台讯】边区公路管理局，顷拨款四十五万元，兴修平汉公路古坨村及七里河北岸两大砖桥，短期内即可落成。届时公路交通，将无因雨季水涨断绝之虞。（郭韵江）
