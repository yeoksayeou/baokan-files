    Criticizes US Policy Toward Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th] TASS, Moscow, 28th: The News Bulletin's diplomatic observer criticized US policy toward Japan, stating: The Potsdam Declaration, regarding the section on Japan, stipulated that the Allied powers should provide all assistance to Japanese organizations attempting to democratize the country. Based on this promise, the Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan proposed the implementation of labor legislation in Japan (which advocated for the basic rights of Japanese laborers). The US representative, Acheson, completely illogically stated that there was "communist propaganda" in the Soviet proposal. To prove Acheson's shallowness, the Soviet delegation to the Allied Council for Japan held a press conference to explain the Soviet proposal on labor legislation in detail to Allied and Japanese journalists in order to eliminate any attempts to distort the proposal, which was an absolutely legitimate attitude. However, according to the Tokyo correspondent of the New York Times, General MacArthur was extremely angry about the recent reception held by the Soviet mission because the occupation authorities' policies regarding labor legislation were criticized at the meeting. It is strange that MacArthur's anger was only directed at the representative of an Allied power with equal control rights, while certain other facts that clearly violate the Potsdam Declaration and the terms of Japan's surrender did not arouse the anger of the US occupation authorities. The meeting of the Allied Council on July 10th elicited lively commentary from Japanese newspapers under US control, such as the Yomiuri Shimbun, which even suggested that the rights of members of the Allied Council might be discussed. It also pointed out that Prime Minister Yoshida and his colleagues were using this session of the Japanese Diet to attempt to revise the basic principles of Japan's surrender. It is strange that the Japanese militarists did not arouse the anger of the US occupation authorities. Furthermore, at the Allied Council on July 24th, the Soviet Union urged that fascist books, especially Hitler's "Mein Kampf," should be banned, but the US occupation authorities came out to protect the so-called "freedom of thought and speech" of Japanese reactionaries.

    抨击美国对日政策
    【新华社延安二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：消息报外交观察家抨击美国对日政策称：波茨顿宣言关于日本部分，曾规定盟国关于企图使日本民主化的该国社团予以一切援助，盟国对日委员会苏联代表曾根据这种诺言，提出在日本实行劳工立法的提案（该提案主张规定日本劳工的基本权利），美国代表艾契森完全违反逻辑，说在苏联的提案中“有共产主义的宣传”。为了证明艾契森的浅薄，盟国对日委员会苏联代表曾举行记者招待会，向盟国及日本记者详细解释苏联关于劳工立法的提案，以便消除一切对该提案曲解的企图，这是绝对正当的态度。但是，据纽约时报东京记者称：麦克阿瑟将军对于苏联使团最近举行的招待会，极为愤怒，因为在这次会上，占领当局关于劳工立法方面的政策，曾受到批评。很奇怪的是麦氏的这种愤怒，仅仅是针对着与美国有同等管制权的盟国代表而发，然而另外某些显然违反波茨顿宣言及日本投降条款的事实，却没有激起美国占领当局的愤怒。盟国委员会七月十日的会议，引起了美国控制下的日本报纸的生动评论，如读卖新闻甚至认为可能要讨论对日委员会委员的权利，同时也指出首相吉田以及他的同僚，正利用这一届日本议会，企图修改日本投降的基本原则。很奇怪的，是日本的军阀们并没有引起美国占领当局的愤怒。此外，在七月二十四日的盟国委员会上，苏联曾敦促法西斯书籍、特别是希特勒的“我的奋斗”应加禁绝，而美国占领当局却又出来保护日本反动分子的所谓“思想与言论自由”了。
