[From Our Correspondent in Heze, 20th] Following the donation of 2 million yuan by the citizens of Heze to comfort the troops, Jining City has also launched a wave of support for the military. All citizens voluntarily donated 3 million yuan and sent a letter to Commander Liu and Deng of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, forwarding it to the frontline commanders and soldiers, stating: We, the 140,000 people of Jining, vow to be your rearguard. In addition to completing our assigned work with great enthusiasm, stabilizing the rear area order, and striving for production, we express our condolences with the greatest enthusiasm by donating 3 million yuan!
Note: Since Jining City was liberated, the Kuomintang has frequently dispatched armed agents to sneak in and sabotage, and has continuously sent planes to bomb, causing great indignation among the citizens. The victory of the Longhai Campaign has greatly inspired the people, who have all volunteered to support the military and resolutely counterattack the reactionaries.

[From Our Correspondent in Yangcheng] Under the surge of patriotic enthusiasm, more than 130 teachers and students of the Taiyue Middle School Hongzhao Branch voluntarily left the school to participate in the self-defense war. On the first day of the Hongzhao battle (14th), Teaching Affairs Officer Guo Wangcai and Grade Teacher Zhao Yimin led more than 40 students to participate in the front-line work teams of Huo and Zhao counties. During the Baoyan Temple battle, when stretchers were temporarily in short supply, students voluntarily formed ten stretchers, led by Deputy Teaching Affairs Director Nan Chuan, and rushed to the front line overnight. More than 30 younger students in the school also formed five groups, led by teachers, some of whom helped women in villages along the wounded transport line prepare boiled water and food; others served as nurses at the wounded transfer station. During their breaks, they also went to the liberated villages and towns west of the road to do propaganda and condolences work, helping them organize stretchers. After the recovery of Zhaocheng, they entered the city to conduct propaganda, appeasement, and theatrical performances. The self-defense battlefield became their great university.

　　誓为前线作战后盾
    济宁献金三百万劳军
    太岳中学洪赵分校师生奔赴前线
    【本报荷泽二十日电】继荷泽市民二百万元劳军之后，济宁市亦掀起劳军热潮。全体市民自动献金三百万元，并致书晋冀鲁豫军区刘、邓首长转前线指战员，略谓：我济宁十四万人民誓作后盾，除以高度积极性完成份内工作，安定后方秩序，努力生产外，仅以最大热忱，献金三百万元以表慰问之忱！
    按：济宁市自我光复以来，国民党经常遣派武装特务潜行破坏，并不断派遣飞机轰炸，市民万分愤慨。陇海告捷，万众欣奋，均纷纷自动劳军支援前线，予反动派以坚决反击。
    【本报阳城讯】在爱国热情的激荡下，太岳中学洪赵分校师生一百三十余人，自动走出校门，参加了自卫战争。洪赵战役开始的第一天（十四日），教务员郭旺才、级任教员赵益民，率领四十余个学生，分头参加霍、赵两县前方工作队。在宝严寺战斗中，担架一时不敷分配，学生自动组成十付担架，由副教务主任南川率领，连夜奔赴前线。在校的三十多个年幼学生，亦组成五个小组，由教员分别领导，有的在伤兵运输线上帮助沿村妇女准备开水、食品；有的到伤员转送站担任看护。他们在休息时间，还到路西旁解放村镇做宣传慰问工作，帮助他们组织担架。收复赵城后，又进城做宣传安抚演剧工作，自卫战场成了他们的大学校。
