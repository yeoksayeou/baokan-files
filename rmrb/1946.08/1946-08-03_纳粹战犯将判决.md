　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Nuremberg - The trial of Nazi war criminals is nearing sentencing. On the 25th, after U.S. prosecutor Jackson delivered his summation of the eight-month trial, British prosecutor Shawcross and French Assistant Prosecutor, among others, also delivered their summations. Shawcross demanded that the court find all defendants guilty, as only this could demonstrate international justice and truth. When Shawcross denounced Ribbentrop as a "common murderer," the accused turned pale and collapsed forward. Dubost demanded the execution of the Nazi defendants, saying that if those who ordered the killings were not given the maximum penalty, then those who obeyed orders to kill could not be executed. In their final statement, the Soviet prosecutors declared: "On behalf of the Soviet people, I demand that the most severe sentence be imposed on all defendants." It is said that the final verdict may be held in mid-August.

　　纳粹战犯将判决
    【新华社延安三十一日电】努连堡讯：纳粹战犯之审判已将判决。二十五日，美检查官杰克逊发表其对审判八个月来之总结后，英检查官肖克劳斯、法国助理起诉官等人亦先后发表其总结。肖克劳斯要求法庭判定一切被告均有罪，如此始能显示出国际间正义与真理。肖氏斥里宾特洛甫为“普通杀人犯”时，该犯即面色惨白，向前扑倒。杜波斯要求处死纳粹被告，他说：如果对下令杀人者不给以最高处罚，即不能处死那些奉命杀人者。苏联起诉人在其最后声明中声称：“我代表苏联人民要求对所有被告处以最严厉的判决。”据称：最后判决可能在八月中旬举行。
