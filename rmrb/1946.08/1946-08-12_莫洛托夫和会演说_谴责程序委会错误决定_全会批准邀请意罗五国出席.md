Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th Dispatch: Paris News: The Peace Conference's plenary session reconvened at 4 PM on the 8th. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech to the assembly, declaring that the Soviet delegation believes the Procedural Rules Committee's decision to adopt the British Foreign Ministers' Council's proposed amendment to the Peace Conference's voting rules was an erroneous decision. Molotov reiterated that the Soviet delegation insists on revising this decision by the Procedural Committee. The plenary session adjourned without making any decision on this matter. The plenary session formally approved the invitation to the five enemy states yesterday and invited them to attend the meeting on Saturday. Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi will speak first at that time. De Gasperi arrived in Paris on the 31st from Rome. The Italian delegation submitted a memorandum to the Peace Conference on the 7th containing three points: a protest against the modification of the Franco-Italian border and the economic terms for Italy. The economic memorandum focuses on opposition to occupation fees by the British and Americans. Also, news: On the morning of the 7th, US Secretary of State Byrnes stated that he had reported to Truman via a transatlantic long-distance telephone call regarding his argument with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 6th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th Dispatch: Paris News: The Peace Conference's Procedural Rules Committee continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 7th. Fewer representatives attended this meeting than any previous session. The committee passed the following proposal: All procedural issues not favored by the Procedural Committee shall be determined based on the principles of the United Nations' rules of procedure. A proposed amendment by Byrnes in the Procedural Committee was also passed by the meeting. This amendment stipulates that member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council shall not serve as chairmen of any treaty draft committee. Also, if a member of a country's delegation is elected as chairman of a committee, other members of that country's delegation may not be appointed as chairmen of another committee. The committee also unanimously agreed without a vote to Yugoslavia's proposal, namely, after the treaty draft is adopted by the Peace Conference, any allied country bordering the former five enemy states may directly appeal to the Foreign Ministers' Council. Australian representative Evatt also requested that the documents and reports on which the four powers base their resolutions on the treaty draft be made public to the General Assembly and various committees. This request was not opposed. The committee adjourned at 7:30 PM.

    谴责程序委会错误决定         
    全会批准邀请意罗五国出席
    【新华社延安九日电】巴黎讯：和会全体大会于八日下午四时重开，苏外长莫洛托夫对大会发表演说，宣称苏联代表团认为程序规则委员会采纳英国对外长会议所提和会表决规则之修正案的决定是错误的决定。莫氏复称：苏联代表团坚持修改程序委员会的这一决定。关于这一问题，全会未作任何决定即代休会。全会已于昨日正式批准将邀五敌国之请柬，并邀请他们于星期六出席会议。届时意总理加斯贝利将首先发言，加氏于三十一日自罗马抵巴黎，意大利代表团已于七日向和会提了包含三点意见的备忘录，要点是抗议法意边界的修改，及对意经济条款，经济备忘录着重于反对英美占领费等。又讯：七日晨，美国务卿贝纳斯曾说他于六日与苏外长莫洛托夫争论情形，经横越大西洋之长途电话向杜鲁门作报告。
    【新华社延安九日电】巴黎讯：和会程序规则委员会于七日下午继续集会，出席此次会议之代表较任何一次为少。委员会通过下列提议：凡程委会所未获利之一切程序问题，俱根据联合国程序规则的原则确定。贝纳斯在程委会提出一项修正建议亦经会议通过，此修正建议规定外长会议之会员国，不得担任任何和约草案委员会之主席，同时如一国家之代表团团员当选为某一委员会主席时，该国代表团其他团员亦不得再被任为另一委员会主席。委员会又未经表决一致同意南斯拉夫之提议，即在条约草案被和会采纳之后，允许与前五敌国接壤之任何一盟国可向外长会议直接提出吁请。澳代表伊瓦特又要求四强对和约草案作决议时所依据之文件与报告公诸大会及各个委员会，此一要求未遇反对。委员会于下午七点半休会。
