　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Paris dispatch: Manuilsky, the chief representative of the Ukrainian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, announced on the evening of the 24th that he had, in the name of the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council in New York, accusing the Greek government of causing a "serious danger to peace" in the Balkans. The letter, telegraphed on the evening of the 23rd, stated: As a result of the irresponsible policies of the current Greek government, a certain situation has arisen in the Balkans. Numerous border conflicts between Greece and Albania were instigated by the Greek army with the connivance and encouragement of the Greek government. The Greek army systematically fired at Albanian border guards and farmers. Foreign troops are still stationed in Greece, supporting collaborators and suppressing patriotic fighters. Under these circumstances, holding a plebiscite on the restoration of the monarchy is contrary to the war aims of the Allied powers. The Ukrainian government requests the Security Council to place this issue on the agenda of its next meeting in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and to consider taking steps without further delay to eliminate this threat to peace.

　　曼努伊斯基函安全理事会
    控诉希腊威胁巴尔干和平
    【新华社延安二十五日电】巴黎讯：出席巴黎和会的乌克兰代表团首席代表曼努伊斯基，于二十四日晚宣布：他已以乌克兰外长名义代表其政府致函纽约联合国安全理事会，控诉希腊政府在巴尔干引起“对和平严重的危险”。该函是于廿三日晚用电报拍出，内称：由于目前希腊政府不负责任的政策的结果，巴尔干已发生了某种局势，希腊与阿尔巴尼亚边境上无数次冲突事件，都是在希腊政府的纵容与鼓励下由希军挑起的，希军有系统的向阿国边境的卫兵及农民开枪，外国军队还驻在希腊支持通敌分子，打击爱国志士。在这种情形下，举行王朝复决投票是违背盟国作战目的的，乌克兰政府要求安理会按照联合国宪章将这一问题置于下次会议的议程上，并应不再延迟地考虑采取步骤，以消除这一对和平的威胁。
