　　Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 12th (Delayed Dispatch) The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Eighth Route Army launched a counter-offensive on the Longhai Railway on the night of the 10th and liberated Lanfeng, more than 40 kilometers east of Kaifeng on the Longhai Line, Lizhuang Station, more than 60 kilometers west of Xuzhou, and many towns and stations between Lanfeng and Lizhuang. A spokesperson for the military region stated: "In view of the fact that Chiang's troops, after attacking most of our Yuduong region, have also occupied the entire Hubei-Henan border region and are still pursuing the Central Plains Military Region troops. On the Jiangsu-Anhui front, they have occupied areas such as Dingyuan, Tianchang, Sixian, Xiaoxian, and Rugao, and are now continuing to attack Dongtai and Gaoyou. At the same time, they are colluding with puppet troops to launch offensives from the central section of the Longhai Railway towards the Fengpei region to the north and the Xiayi, Yongcheng, Shangqiu, Ju county, and Zhe county regions to the south. In order to stop the fierce flames of Chiang's army's civil war, we had no choice but to launch a counter-offensive on the Longhai Railway on the night of the 10th, and have now liberated Lanfeng, Yejigang, Liba, Liuheji, Yangji, Dangshan, Lizhuang and other towns and stations. More than 100 kilometers of this section of the Longhai Railway is now under our control. According to preliminary statistics, in the Lanfeng campaign, we annihilated more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, forced more than 2,500 to lay down their weapons, and captured 11 tanks, several mortars, more than 200 small cannons, more than 50 heavy machine guns, more than 200 light machine guns, and more than 3,000 rifles."
　　
　　(Delayed Dispatch) Our newspaper, Heze, 14th The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in the central section of the Longhai Railway, who are attacking the Yuduong, Huaibei, and Sulu border liberated areas, continue to suffer powerful counterattacks from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Eighth Route Army. According to supplementary war reports from the front lines: The Eighth Route Army launched a counter-offensive on the night of the 10th, and by the 13th, it had liberated many stations between Huangkou, more than 60 miles west of Xuzhou, and Luowang, 20 miles west of Lanfeng, including Huangkou, Lizhuang, Dangshan, Yangji, Liudi Quan, Liuheji, Liba, Yejigang, Lanfeng, and Luowang. As a result, nearly 300 miles of the central section of the Longhai Railway are now under the control of the Eighth Route Army. In this campaign, more than 8,000 men of the Kuomintang's Cao Fulin's 55th Army, 74th Division, and the puppet Zhang Lan's Provisional Fourth Column were annihilated or laid down their weapons. According to preliminary investigations, we captured a total of 11 tanks, more than 4,000 rifles, more than 350 light and heavy machine guns, more than 200 large and small cannons, three radio stations, 30 telephones, more than 100 war horses, eight trucks, four jeeps, and many other military supplies. Chiang's troops are still sending large reinforcements to the line, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 15th The Chiang's troops in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, and between the Jinpu Longhai railways and the Grand Canal triangle area, continue to attack the Shandong liberated area, and have occupied the two county towns of Linzi and Guangrao. The main force of the Chiang Kai-shek's 8th Army, which was assembled at Zhangdian in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, invaded eastward along the railway on the 26th of last month, occupied the two stations of Xindian and Putong, and then turned to invade northward. The military and civilians in the Bohai area resolutely defended themselves, and the Linzi militia captured many Chiang's soldiers alive within two days. After suffering considerable damage, Chiang's troops occupied the two county towns of Linzi and Guangrao on the 8th and 10th of this month. Guangrao City was liberated by the Eighth Route Army from the hands of the enemy puppets on August 23rd of last year. Linzi City was recaptured twice from the hands of the enemy puppets on August 21st and October 1st of last year after bloody battles. It was once invaded by Chiang's troops on the 3rd of last month and was recovered by the Eighth Route Army on the 5th. On the southern Shandong front, the 37th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 77th Army, which invaded from Jiawang North to Duan East, occupied Jiantou (northeast of Jiawang), an important town on the south bank of the Grand Canal, on the 29th of last month, and continued to expand outwards on the 9th of this month, encountering a strong counterattack from the Eighth Route Army, leaving behind more than 70 corpses and fleeing back to their original location. As of the 7th, the main force of Chiang's 77th Army, which had invaded from Hanzhuang and Jiawang on the Jinpu Railway, had occupied a line of about 40 li on the north bank of the Grand Canal from Hanzhuang to Julianqiong (a ferry crossing on the Grand Canal, 32 li east of Hanzhuang), and is now confronting our army. Chiang Kai-shek's 97th Army, which is entrenched in the isolated stronghold of Lincheng on the Jinpu Line, is gathering its 33rd Division and waiting for orders to go south, in an attempt to cooperate with Chiang's troops, who are invading north from Hanzhuang, to open up the Lin (cheng) - Han (zhuang) section of the Jinpu Railway.
　　
　　Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 15th A certain unit of the Eighth Route Army in central Shanxi, on the 10th of this month, defeated more than 4,500 Yan's troops advancing in two directions and recovered important villages and towns such as Hongshan and Zhangliang. On the 10th, the 44th Division of Yan's army, in order to coordinate with the Chiang Kai-shek's army's offensive in southern Shanxi, launched an attack on our central Shanxi area in two directions at the same time. One route, with more than 2,500 men, advanced from Hongshan and Zhangliang in Jiexiu to the northeast 30-li area; the other route, with more than 2,000 men, advanced from Yuebi and Liji in Pingyao to the southwest area, attempting to encircle our garrison troops in the Mabi and Duncun areas. Our military learned of this in advance, maneuvered to the outer line, and combined with the local militia, fought bravely all day, and at dusk, defeated the Yan's troops advancing in two directions, and took the opportunity to recover all the villages and towns of Hongshan, Zhangliang, Aoziling, Yuebi, and Liji, which had fallen into the hands of Yan's troops on the 9th.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 15th News from Chifeng Military: The Chiang's troops, who invaded along the Ye-Chi Line on the 30th of last month, were defeated and fled back to Dayi Station under the heroic counterattack of the military and civilians in the liberated area. In this battle, more than 60 of Chiang's soldiers were killed, including one commander, one captain, and one major company commander. More than 120 of Chiang's soldiers were wounded, and 40 officers and soldiers were captured. The defending army captured 50 war horses, more than 30 long and short guns, and one machine gun. Chiang's troops are currently repairing the railway in the Tianyi area and are sending out bandits who have been incorporated to harass the area, seemingly intending to commit another crime.
