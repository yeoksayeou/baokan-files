　　The Border Region Government Decides to Further Develop Production and Construction
    Issuing 1.5 Billion in Loans to Workers and Farmers
    Pengcheng Public-Private Jointly Establish Porcelain Industry Sales Cooperative
    [Handan, 26th Dispatch] In order to further develop large-scale production and construction throughout the entire Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, the Border Region Government has decided to issue 100 to 150 billion yuan in low-interest loans to workers and farmers in the second half of this year. The main targets of these loans are rural handicrafts, industry, and the coal, iron, porcelain, and water conservancy industries. The specific allocation figures for the Taihang, Taiyue, Ji'nan, and Ji-Lu-Yu regions are currently being discussed with the administrative offices of each region. Furthermore, in order to improve and expand the Pengcheng porcelain industry, the Border Region Government has decided to lend 20 million yuan, which will be discussed and distributed democratically by Pengcheng potters and workers to industrialists and the porcelain industry sales cooperative. The interest rate on this porcelain industry loan is extremely low. It is reported that the most pressing problem for the Pengcheng porcelain industry is opening up sales channels. In order to prevent private manipulation and affect industrial development, the government has organized a public-private joint venture sales cooperative to transport goods in a timely manner and ensure that industrialists are profitable.

    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng News] Industry in Jincheng, Yangcheng and other counties in the Taiyue region is developing actively under the support of the democratic government. In the past six months, the Ji'nan Bank has issued more than 7,111,900 yuan in loans in Jincheng County alone. As of now, a total of 15 new factories have been built in the county, and the Yongyu Iron Industry Company, which has been in preparation for more than a month, has also started construction recently. The potassium nitrate (saltpeter) industry in Xizhi, Yangcheng County, which was severely damaged by the enemy, has now exceeded three times its pre-war production with the strong help of the democratic government. In addition, the egg industry has also seen new developments. Recently, a large-scale egg factory, initiated and prepared by Mr. Chen Ruitang of Jincheng and others, is actively building houses and will be able to start construction in the autumn. The chicken farm attached to the factory has already produced 150,000 chicks.
    [Weixian News] The leather and hat industry in Daying Town, Zaoqiang County, Ji'nan, which was once prosperous, almost completely collapsed after the enemy's invasion. Although the democratic government has made every effort to promote it after the victory, most of the owners of the industry have adopted a wait-and-see attitude because they failed to understand the development of industry and commerce policies in the liberated areas for a while. After repeated explanations and practical support, 39 new leather workshops and 34 hat workshops have been established in the villages around Daying Town. Both workshops have more than 100 workers and have received a total of 2.37 million yuan in low-interest industrial loans from the government. In addition, there are now more than 20 leather workshops in Daying Town alone. In addition, supporting industries and commerce have also emerged, including 54 grocery stores, grain stores, and bicycle shops, all of which have received various low-interest industrial and commercial loans from the government and have made substantial profits. Therefore, Daying Town today is not what it used to be, and everyone is radiant and beaming.

　　边府决定进一步开展生产建设
    发放工农贷款十五亿
    彭城公私合组磁业运销合作社
    【邯郸二十六日电】晋冀鲁豫边区政府为了进一步开展全边区大规模生产建设，决定今年下半年发放低利工农贷款十万万至十五万万元。此项贷款主要对象是农村手工业、工业以及煤、铁、磁水利各业。太行、太岳、冀南、冀鲁豫各区具体分配数字，正与各行署商洽中。又为改进与扩大彭城磁业，边府已决定贷予两千万元，由彭城窑业家工人民主讨论分配用途，分别贷予工业家、及磁业运销合作社。此项磁工业贷款，利息极低。据悉彭城磁业目前最迫切的问题是打开销路，政府为了防止私人操纵，影响工业发展，已组织公私合营运销合作社，及时把货物运出，保证工业家有利可图。（农）
    【本报阳城讯】太岳区晋城、阳城等县工业，在民主政府扶植下积极发展。半年来冀南银行仅在晋城一县所发放之贷款即达七百一十一万九千余元。截至目前为止，该县新建工厂共十五座，筹备月余之永裕铁业公司，亦于日前开工。备受敌人摧残之阳城县西之硝酸钾（火硝）业，在民主政府大力帮助下，现已超过战前生产三倍。此外，蛋业亦有新的发展，近由晋城陈瑞堂先生等所发起筹备一规模较大之蛋厂，正积极修筑房屋，秋后即可开工，该厂所附设之鸡厂现已出小鸡十五万只。
    【威县讯】冀南枣强县大营镇一带曾繁盛一时之皮、帽工业，自敌人入侵后几至全部垮台，胜利后民主政府虽竭力提倡，因该业业主对解放区发展工商政策一时未能了解，多抱观望态度，后经多次解释及实际扶植结果，大营镇周围村庄现已新建立皮作坊三十九家，帽头作坊三十四家，该两项作坊均拥有百名以上的工人，并共得到政府低利工业贷款二百三十七万元。又，仅大营镇内现已有二十余家皮作坊，此外还有与此相适应的工商业亦应运而生，计有杂货店、粮行、自行车行等共五十四家，均得到政府各种工商业低利贷款，并获厚利，故今天之大营镇已非昔日可比，人人都红光满面，喜形于色。
