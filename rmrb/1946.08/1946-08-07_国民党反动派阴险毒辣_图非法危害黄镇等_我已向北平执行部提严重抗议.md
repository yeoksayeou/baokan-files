　　The Kuomintang Reactionaries Are Sinister and Vicious
    Plotting to Illegally Harm Huang Zhen and Others
    I Have Lodged a Serious Protest with the Beiping Executive Headquarters
    [This newspaper, Handan, 3rd dispatch] According to information obtained by our reporter: The Kuomintang reactionaries are using sinister and vicious means to prepare to further implement cruel methods against General Huang Zhen, the Chinese Communist representative of the Xinxiang group, and others. For more than a month, the Chinese Communist representative Major General Huang Zhen and his party have been deprived of their freedom, never being able to leave the Xinxiang group's premises, causing the group's work to cease. Recently, a certain high-ranking special agent of the Kuomintang telegraphed his subordinates in Xinxiang to fabricate slanderous incidents against our representative Huang, preparing to take even more ferocious and illegal actions against Huang and others. At the same time, they are also attempting to take similar illegal actions against Chinese Communist personnel in other groups, with the aim of disrupting the Executive Headquarters' work in order to launch a nationwide civil war. It is reported that our representative has lodged a serious protest with the Beiping Executive Headquarters, demanding the immediate restoration of freedom to Huang Zhen and other group personnel, guaranteeing their safety, and restoring the work of the Xinxiang group.

    【本报邯郸三日电】据记者获息：国民党反动派正以阴险恶毒手段，对新乡小组中共代表黄镇将军等准备进一步实行狠毒手段，迄今月余，中共代表黄镇少将一行等失去自由，从未能出新乡小组之门，致使小组工作停止。最近国方特务头子某要员又曾电示其新乡所属多方制造对我黄代表等之诬蔑事件，准备对黄等实行更凶恶之非法行动。同时亦企图在其他小组对中共人员采取同样违法行动，目的为破坏执行部工作以发动全国普遍的内战。闻我方代表为此已向北平执行部提出严重抗议，要求立即恢复黄镇等小组人员自由，保证其安全，并恢复新乡小组工作。
