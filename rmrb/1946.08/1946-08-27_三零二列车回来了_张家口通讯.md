　　Train No. 302 Returns
　　Zhangjiakou Communication

　　On the morning of the 13th, Train No. 302 on the Ping-Sui Railway, which was destroyed by American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes near Yanggao Station, arrived safely at Zhangjiakou Main Station at 5:00 AM on the 15th after being repaired overnight by the station and the railway employees on the train. Nearly a hundred representatives from the General Trade Union of the Jin-Cha-Ji Railway, the Zhangjiakou Branch of the Ping-Sui Railway, standing committee members, and workers' self-defense team members from various repair factories gathered on the platform to welcome them. When the train entered the platform, the representatives swarmed forward. The first to jump off the train engine and greet everyone was the driver, Li Fengchao, who was injured by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. With a tight bandage, he shook hands and embraced everyone, overwhelmed. Many workers were speechless with emotion upon seeing their brave comrades return. Next to get off was the train conductor, Lin Xiu, and other workers. Although Conductor Lin had been up all night leading the employees in repairing the train cars, he showed no signs of fatigue. After thanking everyone, he quickly directed the employees to carefully carry the seriously injured passengers and workers onto ambulances headed for the hospital. All the workers of Train No. 302 were welcomed into the waiting room hall, where the tables were piled high with cakes, fruits, cigarettes, and other gifts from the workers. A solemn welcoming ceremony and a rally to denounce Chiang Kai-shek's fascist massacre of peaceful people began. After Train Conductor Lin Xiu reported on the eight consecutive attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's planes on Train No. 302 in a single day and the repair efforts, he resolutely swore on behalf of all the train's employees: "Neither American planes nor dumdum bullets can scare us; on the contrary, they only strengthen our hatred for the reactionaries and our determination to fight. In addition to denouncing Chiang Kai-shek to the world, especially to the American people, for using American-aided killing weapons to massacre innocent civilians, we are determined to maintain the smooth and unimpeded railway transportation in the liberated areas day and night to answer the reactionaries' sabotage." The injured driver, Li Fengchao, said: "The first time I was strafed by planes was during the 'July 7th' Incident that year. Those were Japanese planes, and I didn't say a word. But this time, I was strafed by American planes flown by Chinese people, which is the most hateful thing. This time, when the people on the train ran into the sorghum fields, Chiang Kai-shek's American-made planes chased after them and strafed the sorghum fields. When the people ran into the woods, they strafed the woods again. What law did the people break? The most tragic thing was a 19-year-old woman in the fifth district of Yanggao, who died on the train and was burned to ashes along with the train car before she could be carried off. The machine gun bullets were all thick, American-made things (the collected shell casings were all marked as American-made dumdum bullets). We workers cannot remain silent and acquiesce to the reactionaries' heinous crimes!" All the workers were extremely indignant and vowed to intensify their work to defend the border area and smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive.

　　三零二列车回来了
    张家口通讯
    十三日晨，在阳高车站附近被美制蒋机击毁的平绥路第三零二列车，经该站及随车铁路员工连夜修理后，已于十五日黎明五时安抵张家口总站。晋察冀铁路总工会，平绥路张市分会各常委及各修理厂职工工人自卫队代表等百余人，已齐集月台迎候。当列车进入月台时，各代表即蜂涌而上。首先从列车机头上跳下来与大家相见的是被蒋机射伤的司机李凤潮，他缚紧绷带应接不暇的和大家握手拥抱，许多工人看见了回来的自己的勇敢伙伴，感动的说不出话来。接着下车的是列车长林修和其他工人们。林车长虽然彻夜未眠领导员工们修理车辆，但没有一点疲劳的神色。他向大家致谢后，即迅速指挥职工们将重伤的旅客、工人一一抬上救护车驶去医院。三零二次列车的全体工人都被欢迎到候车室大厅，桌上堆满工人们送来的蛋糕、水果、香烟等礼物。一场庄严的欢迎会，和控诉蒋介石法西斯屠杀和平人民的大会开始了。列车长林修报告了三零二次列车一日间连续遭到蒋机八次袭击及抢修的经过后，即代表该车全体员工坚决宣誓称：“随便美式飞机或者达姆弹都吓不倒我们，反更增强了我们对反动派的仇恨和斗争决心。我们除向全世界特别向美国人民控诉蒋介石拿上美国援助的杀人武器屠杀无辜老百姓外，我们决以日夜保持解放区铁路运输的顺利畅通，来回答反动派们的破坏。”受伤的司机李凤潮说：“我第一次受到飞机射扫是‘七七’事变那一年，那是日本飞机，我一句话也没有说。这回我却被中国人驾的美国飞机扫射了，这就最可恨不过了。这一次老百姓从车上跑到高粱地，蒋介石的美造飞机就追逐着扫射高粱地，老百姓跑到树林，他们又扫射到树林，究竟老百姓犯了什么法呢？最惨的是阳高五区一位十九岁的妇女，死在车上未及抬下来就跟车厢一块烧成灰了。机枪子弹都是指头粗的美国货（按拾到的弹壳均有记号系美制达姆弹）。我们工人们对反动派这种滔天罪行决不能沉默和甘休！”全体工友情绪极均激愤，誓为保卫边区粉碎蒋介石进攻而加紧工作。
