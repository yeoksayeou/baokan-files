　　【Linzhang News from this newspaper】Coordinating with the Kuomintang reactionaries' military offensive, the Anyang National Special Agents, combined with the traitor Guo Qing, Wang Ziquan and other plainclothes special agent bandits, frequently crossed the Zhang River, lurking in the border areas of Linzhang, carrying out sabotage activities such as looting, assassination, kidnapping, and extortion. Under the slogan of "Preventing Bandits and Defending Themselves" issued by our democratic government, the masses in various districts of the Third and Fifth Districts have organized militia to arm themselves for self-defense. In the riverine areas, the militia actively operated to protect the masses' wheat harvest and oppose the plainclothes teams' demands for payment and extortion, which won the support of the masses. In various areas of the First and Third Districts, mobilizing the masses was closely integrated with armed struggle against the enemy, directly protecting the fruits of the masses' emancipation. The local militia joint defense and joint security system has begun to be established, restricting the activities of plainclothes bandits.
    However, in some villages, the armed forces were divorced from the mass struggle, and the militia was controlled by local bullies and landlords and a few hooligans. Special agents used threats and inducements to buy off militia cadres, disintegrate the militia, and surrender to the enemy. In the riverine villages of the Fifth District, traitorous landlords colluded with Guo Qing's plainclothes agents, staging a militia rebellion conspiracy, which has aroused serious vigilance among our military and civilians. On July 4th and 5th, the plainclothes teams were repeatedly intercepted by our militia joint defense teams when they crossed the river. The struggle against the enemy in the border areas is becoming increasingly tense. The county headquarters is drawing up a joint defense force of the militia, establishing unified command, and taking advantage of the rising water of the Zhang River to actively eliminate and combat plainclothes special agent activities.
    According to what this reporter has learned: the people of Linzhang are brave and have experience in the struggle against Guo Qing. In the future, in the struggle against stubborn and puppet special agents, we should further grasp the universal demand of the masses to oppose traitors and enemies and oppose extortion, and mobilize the masses to arm themselves for self-defense. We should combine the mobilization of the masses with the armed self-defense struggle, and transform the armed forces in the struggle, and strengthen the unified command of the Party, government, army and people, so as to achieve the goal of protecting the masses' emancipation and supporting the front.

　　临漳边地斗争紧张群众武装保卫翻身
　　【本报临漳讯】配合国民党反动派的军事进攻，安阳国特结合汉奸郭清、王自全等部便衣特务土匪，经常偷渡漳河，潜伏临漳边地，进行抢劫、暗杀绑、票勒索等破坏活动，三五区各地群众在我民主政府“防匪自卫”口号下，纷纷组织民兵武装自卫。在沿河地区，民兵积极活动，保卫群众麦收，反对便衣队催款勒索，得到了群众的拥护。一三区各地，发动群众与武装对敌斗争紧密结合，直接保护了群众翻身成果。各地民兵联防和联环保制度开始成立，限制了便衣土匪活动。
    但有的村庄，武装与发动群众斗争脱节，民兵为恶霸地主与少数流氓分子掌握。特务分子以威胁利诱方式，收买民兵干部，瓦解民兵投敌。五区沿河村庄汉奸地主勾结郭清便衣，串演民兵叛变阴谋，已引起我军民严重警惕。七月四五两日便衣队渡河时，曾接连遭我民兵联防队阻击，边沿地区对敌斗争，日趋紧张。县指挥部正抽组民兵联防武装，建立统一指挥，乘漳河水涨之际，积极清剿打击便衣特务活动。
    据记者所悉：临漳民性强悍，具有反郭清斗争经验，今后在对顽伪特务斗争中，应更抓紧群众反资敌反勒索的普遍要求，发动群众武装自卫。把发动群众与武装自卫斗争结合起来，并在斗争中改造武装，加强党政军民的统一指挥，以便达成保卫群众翻身，支援前线之目的。
