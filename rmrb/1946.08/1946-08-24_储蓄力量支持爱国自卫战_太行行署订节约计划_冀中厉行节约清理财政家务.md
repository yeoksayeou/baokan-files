　　Saving Strength to Support the Patriotic Self-Defense War
　　Taihang Administrative Office Orders Thrift Plan
　　Jizhong Implements Thrift and Cleans Up Financial Affairs
    [Reported from Changzhi by this newspaper] The Taihang Administrative Office, in order to promote the thrift movement, has formulated measures for thrift in the office, which will be implemented starting in the second half of August. The measures are: 1. Office expenses will be based on August as the standard, and efforts will be made to save half. Each department and section should make specific plans to minimize the amount of office supplies received and maximize the use of waste materials. 2. Food expenses will be reduced by 30%, and each person will save two liang of grain per day as stipulated. 3. Allowances for cadres will be suspended. 4. A reward and punishment system will be implemented, and public property savings will be shared according to the Teng Yang plan. In order to thoroughly implement this decision, the administrative office held a thrift mobilization meeting on the 13th of this month. Secretary-General Wu stated that the purpose of thrift is to reduce the burden on the people and save strength to support the self-defense war. He called for establishing a revolutionary household and developing a thrifty style. In addition, the Taihang Xinhua Daily is also practicing thrift, with the number of service personnel being reduced by half, the promotion of the use of waste materials, and the implementation of a savings sharing system.
    [Reported from Changzhi by this newspaper] The Taihang Administrative Office held a financial meeting on the 7th, attended by the finance directors of the administrative office and the special districts, as well as the finance chiefs of Changzhi and Xingtai cities. The main content of the meeting was to review the financial work of the first half of the year and determine the work方針 for the second half of the year. The discussion focused on how to implement long-term planning and increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Director Li Yiqing pointed out in his opening speech that the achievement of Taihang's financial work was supporting the War of Resistance Against Japan for eight years, especially implementing Chairman Mao's "give more, take less," organizing the masses to produce with 90% of the strength, enabling them to become prosperous, and then using 10% of the strength to do collection work, which made the collection work easy. He continued by pointing out that today we are in a tense period, and in order to support the self-defense war, in addition to increasing revenue, we should also plan for the long term, streamline and save, and called on financial cadres to strengthen their sense of responsibility and overall concept, consolidate finances, and overcome chaos.
    [Telegram from Hejian, 19th] In order to fulfill the task of thrift and reduce the burden on the people, party, government, military, and civilian organizations at all levels in Jizhong, as well as village governments, have begun to universally carry out financial settlements and clean up household affairs. The cleaning items include savings, arrears, and public funds for organ production. The Eighth Commissioner's Office, district party committees, and other organs have cleaned out more than 25.34 million yuan in grain and funds. The cooperative of the Commissioner's Office has returned 4 million yuan in production funds and grain owed to the Commissioner's Office in one lump sum, and the Jizhong Administrative Office has also cleaned out more than 1.4 million yuan borrowed by the organ's production cooperative. Party and government organs in various counties generally start by cleaning up their own household affairs, followed by leading and supervising the cleaning up of public grain and property in various villages. After several repeated inspections, the Shenze County Government has cleaned out 1.69 million yuan in public funds from various departments and saved more than 6,700 jin of grain in food expenses. The key to the success or failure of the general cleanup of financial affairs lies in: 1. The responsibility of the leaders and the creation of a broad mass movement are extremely important, and the cleanup cannot rely solely on the general affairs department. 2. The registration and cleanup work should be based on mass opinions, starting with the most wasteful parts of the household affairs, so as not to form a decentralized focus and "avoid the important and dwell on the trivial."

　　储蓄力量支持爱国自卫战
　　太行行署订节约计划
　　冀中厉行节约清理财政家务
    【本报长治讯】太行行署为推进节约运动，已订出行署机关节约办法，自八月下半月开始执行。办法为：一、办公费以八月为标准，争取节约一半，各处、科应作出具体计划，尽量少领办公用具，尽量利用废物。二、菜金节约百分之三十，粮食每人每日按规定节约二两。三、干部津贴一律停发。四、实行奖惩制，节约公物按滕杨方案分红。为彻底执行这一决定，行署于本月十三日召开节约动员大会，武秘书长称：节约目的在于减轻人民负担，储蓄力量支援自卫战争。号召建立革命家务，养成廉朴作风。又太行新华日报亦厉行节约，勤务员已精简一半，提倡利用废物，并实行节约分红制。
    【本报长治讯】太行行署于七日召开财政会议，参加者有行署财政处及各专署与长治、邢台两市财政科长。会议主要内容为检查上半年财政工作，确定下半年工作方针。讨论集中于如何贯彻长远打算与开源节流。李主任一清在开幕词中指出：太行财政工作的成绩是八年来支持了抗战，特别是执行了毛主席“多给少要”，以百分之九十的力量组织群众生产，使其发家致富，以百分之十的力量去做征收工作以后，征收工作即成为轻而易举的事。继指出：今天我们处在紧张时期，为支持自卫战争，除开源外，还应长期打算，精简节约，并号召财政干部加强负责精神与整体观念，整理财政，克服混乱。
    【河间十九日电】为履行节约减轻人民负担，冀中各级党政军民机关及村政权，已开始普遍进行结算财政清理家务工作。清理项目包括节约，积欠及机关生产公款等。第八专员公署，分区等机关，已清理出粮款二千五百三十四万余元。专署机关合作社，归还专署一次拖欠的生产款粮四百万元，冀中行署亦清理出机关生产合作社借的款一百四十余万元。各县党政机关，一般先从清理机关家务着手，紧接着即领导督促清理各村公粮、财物。深泽县府，经几次反复检查，清理出各部门公款一百六十九万元，节约伙食开支合粮六千七百余斤。现初步进行清理的各机关，正深入动员全体干部，进行检查检举，以期彻底肃清财政开支中的浪费现象。一般清理财政家务的成败关键在于：一、首长负责，造成广泛的群众性运动极为重要，不能单靠总务部门负责清理。二、登记清理工作，应根据群众意见，先自家务中最浪费的部分做起，不要形成重点分散和“避重就轻”。
