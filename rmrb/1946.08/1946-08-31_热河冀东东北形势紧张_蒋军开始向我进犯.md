Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 24th (delayed dispatch): Chiang Kai-shek's long-planned military action to attack the Rehe Liberated Area has now fully begun, and battles are taking place in central and eastern Rehe. In central Rehe, one division of the 13th Army, which was increased from Yeboshou to Tianyi and Dujia Wopu (north of Yeboshou), began crossing the Laodian River on the 21st, via Malichengzi, occupying Taohuashan, Bajiazi, Liangkushu, Majiazi, and other places (all northwest of Tianyi). On the 22nd, they continued westward, invading Ningcheng County, and advancing southwest to the vicinity of Balizhong (north of Pingquan), attempting to cooperate with Chiang's troops advancing westward from Pingquan towards Chengde, with the aim of attacking Longhua. In coordination with this offensive by Chiang's troops, bandits organized by Chiang's troops in Weichang, Chifeng, and other places, known as the "Nanyang" forces, are constantly stirring up trouble. These bandits are fleeing from the Chaoyang direction. On the 24th, Chiang's planes also flew to Chengde, Weichang, Chifeng, and other places for strafing and reconnaissance. In eastern Rehe, the 18th Division of the 93rd Army of Chiang's troops, which is assembled in Jinxi, Suizhong, Xingcheng, and other places, has begun to invade the eastern Rehe Liberated Area in multiple directions, and has now invaded Yaowangmiao and Linglongta in eastern Jianchang. Currently, 3,000 Chiang's troops and more than 30 carts are assembled in Yaowangmiao, preparing to continue their westward invasion, joining the Chiang's troops in Xingpingquan to attack Chengde. Fierce battles are currently underway on all fronts.

Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 27th: The Chiang's troops surrounding the eastern Hebei Liberated Area are taking advantage of the Xianghe Incident to actively launch a large-scale offensive. Their adjusted deployment is now complete, and they are beginning to stir along the Great Wall. A portion of Huo Shouyi's 12th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, which has been successively arriving in Qinhuangdao from Shandong, and the 346th Regiment of the 116th Division of the 53rd Army have invaded north, occupying the Yiyuankou pass of the Great Wall in the Linyu Liberated Area. On the 24th, they continued to attack Shanshenmiao and Caozhuang (both under Linyu), and also dispatched more than 100 political bandits led by Li Dingjiao, who were transferred from outside the customs and equipped with light weapons, to operate in the Leting Liberated Area. A portion of the 62nd Army stationed in Tangshan (this army arrived from Taiwan last month) advanced along the Tangshan-Fengrun Highway to Longwangmiao on the 22nd, and continued to Baigezhuang (northeast of Fengrun) on the 24th. They are now forcibly driving local people to build roads on a large scale. The 30th Regiment of the 5th Division of the 94th Army of Chiang's troops in Fengrun has been busy preparing for war for days. The Chiang's troops in this area seem to have the intention of advancing west along the Fengrun-Yutian Highway to attack Yutian. Military transport along the Pinggu line is also extremely frequent. On the 21st, it increased to two divisions in Huairou, one regiment in Miyun, and two battalions of the Yamashita unit of the Japanese army in Shunyi, which has further intensified the situation in the Gubeikou area. On the 18th, a train of Chiang's troops also arrived in Tongxian from Ping, including a unit of American troops. A large-scale war in the Xianghe and Sanhe areas seems likely to break out again within days.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 27th: Chiang Kai-shek has launched a new offensive in the Northeast, causing the Northeast war, which had been slightly eased, to become tense again. More than 2,000 troops of the 87th Division of Chiang's army stationed in Liaoyuan (Zhengjiatun), in coordination with the 6th Division stationed in France, attacked Kangping in two routes, north and south, and invaded the county seat at 8:00 am on the 25th. Kangping County is located on the northern border of Liaoning Province. Liaoyuan to its north, Faku to its south, and Zhangwu to its southwest have all been invaded by Chiang's troops. This invasion of Heping by Chiang's troops clearly aims to expand its occupied area, consolidate and strengthen its occupation and rule, in preparation for launching a further large-scale offensive. Recently, the Central News Agency has been heavily publicizing the Democratic Allied Army's siege of Tieling, with the aim of covering up its own invasion of Kangping.

　　热河冀东东北形势紧张
    蒋军开始向我进犯
    【新华社承德二十四日电】（迟到）蒋介石布置已久的进攻热河解放区的军事行动，业已全面开始，战事正在热中、热东进行中。热中方面，本月二十日十三军一个师，由叶柏寿增至天义及杜家窝铺（叶柏寿北）后，于二十一日开始渡过老店河，经马力城子，占领桃花山、八家子、两棵树、马家子等地（均在天义西北）。二十二日继续西进，侵陷宁城县城，并向西南进攻，进至八里钟（平泉北）一带，有与由平泉向西进犯承德之蒋军相配合，以进攻隆化之势。配合蒋军这一进攻，围场、赤峰等地由蒋军组织的土匪所谓“南洋”部队，不时蠢动。该匪系由朝阳方向窜去者。二十四日，蒋机并出动到承德围场、赤峰等地扫射侦察。热东方面，集结于锦西、绥中、兴城等地蒋军九十三军十八师，已开始分路向热东解放区进犯，现已侵至建昌东药王庙、玲珑塔等地。药王庙现集结蒋军三千余，大车三十余辆，准备继续向西进犯，兴平泉蒋军合犯承德。现各线均激战中。
    【新华社遵化二十七日电】冀东解放区周围蒋军，利用香河事件，积极发动大规模进攻，现调整布署，业已完毕，正在长城沿线开始蠢动。由山东陆续开抵秦皇岛之蒋介石十二军霍守义部一部，及五十三军一一六师三四六团等已北犯，侵占临榆解放区长城隘口义院口。二十四日续犯山神庙、操状（均临榆属）、并由关外征调装备有轻型武器的政治土匪李丁角部百余人派至乐亭解放区活动。驻唐山之六十二军（该军于上月由台湾开来）一部，于二十二日沿唐（山）丰（润）公路进抵龙王庙，二十四日续抵白各庄（丰润东北），现正强驱沿线民众，大事修路。丰润蒋军九十四军五师三十团，连日备战忙碌，该线蒋军似有沿丰润玉田公路西犯玉田模样。平古线蒋军军运亦极频繁，廿一日即增至怀柔两个师，密云一个团，顺义日军山下部队两个大队，古北口方面形势，已因之益趋紧张。通县亦于十八日由平开到蒋军一列车，其中并有美军一部。香河、三河地区大规模战事，日内似将再起。
    【新华社哈尔滨二十七日电】蒋介石在东北已发动新的进攻，致使一度稍息的东北战事复趋紧张。驻辽源（郑家屯）之蒋军八十七师二千余人，配合其驻法国之第六师，以北两路向我康平进攻，并于二十五日上午八时将该县城侵占。按康平县位于辽宁省北部边境，其北面之辽源，南面之法库，西南之彰武，已先后为蒋军侵占。蒋军此次侵入和平，显图扩大其占领范围，巩固与加强其占领与统治，以为进一步发动大规模进攻之准备。近日中央社大事宣传民主联军围攻铁岭，目的即在为其自身之侵陷康平掩护。
