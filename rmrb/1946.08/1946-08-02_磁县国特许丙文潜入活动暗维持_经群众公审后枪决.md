　　Cixian County National Party Agent Xu Bingwen Infiltrates and Secretly Maintains Activities; Executed by Firing Squad After Public Trial by the Masses
　　[Our Newspaper] On the morning of the 21st of last month, 6,000 people in Cixian County gathered in the County Temple of Literature for a public trial of the traitors and special agents Xu Bingwen and Zhang Risheng, who were secretly maintaining activities and sabotaging the liberated areas. After the plaintiff, Jin Zuo, presented conclusive evidence and the masses conducted lengthy questioning and verification, the two traitors confessed to all their criminal activities. Xu Bingwen was from the South Gate of the county and had served the enemy as a military policeman and secret agent, framing many anti-Japanese masses and cadres. After Cixian County was liberated last year, he fled to Anyang, colluded with the special agent leader Wu Jinren, and organized the "Vanguard of Revenge," sneaking back to Cixian County to carry out activities. He once impersonated the Eighth Route Army, robbing and kidnapping, and capturing our personnel. However, his main conspiracy was to threaten villages with rumors of a change of regime, demanding "connections" and "maintenance," and extorting money from them. Last month, he extorted 8,000 yuan (customs gold) in Wanzi Village. Zhang Risheng, the former puppet township chief of the village, also assisted in the activities. In addition to being the first to pay Wanzi's "maintenance fee," he also assigned 10,000 yuan each to villages such as Nanguan, Moli, Shitougou, and Balizhong. Xu and his gang of traitors stayed at Zhang's house every time they came to collect the money. Sometimes, Zhang would bring in "connections" from other villages to urge payment. These criminal activities were captured by us on the 17th of last month.
　　At the end of the public trial, the secretary of the county government called on the masses to organize, be highly vigilant, and smash the encroachment and secret maintenance activities of the traitors and National Party special agents, and defend the liberated area of Cixian County. After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration. Xu and Zhang were executed by firing squad on the outskirts of Nanguan when the demonstrating masses arrived, amidst the thunderous slogans of "Eliminate special agents!"

　　磁县国特许丙文潜入活动暗维持
    经群众公审后枪决
    【本报讯】磁县群众六千人于上月二十一日上午集会县文庙内，公审活动暗维持、破坏解放区的汉奸特务许丙文、张日生。大会经过原告由金佐证据确凿的起诉与群众长时间的质问与对证，二逆乃承认其全部罪恶活动，许丙文是该县南关人，曾给敌人当过宪兵、密探，陷害过许多抗日群众与干部，去年磁县解放后，逃到安阳，与特务头子武金仁勾结，组织“雪耻先锋队”，潜回磁县活动。曾冒充八路军，劫路绑票，捕捉我工作人员。但其主要阴谋计划，则是以变天谣言威胁各村“接头”、“维持”，给他们出款，上月份即在湾子村勒索八千元（关金）。该村前伪乡长张日生也帮助活动，除首先出清湾子的“维持款”外，并向南关、磨里、石头沟、八里冢等村各派一万元。许逆与其奸群每次来催款，都住在张家。有时由张将外村特务“关系”找来催索，这些罪恶活动于上月十七日为我捕获。
    公审大会结束时，县政府秘书号召群众组织起来，严重警惕并击碎汉奸国特的蚕食与暗维持活动，保卫磁县解放区。会后，群众举行示威游行。许、张二逆在示威群众到达南关郊外时，被枪决于震天的“肃清特务”口号声中。
