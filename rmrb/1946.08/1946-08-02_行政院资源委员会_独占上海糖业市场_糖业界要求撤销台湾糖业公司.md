　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Shanghai Report: The Taiwan Sugar Corporation, a sugar trust jointly operated by the Executive Yuan Resources Committee and the Taiwan Provincial Government, has been purchasing large quantities of sugarcane from Taiwan at extremely low prices, exploiting sugarcane farmers since its establishment on May 22. It also ships and dumps large quantities of sugar produced in Taiwan to Shanghai, taking advantage of the sugar shortage to manipulate and raise sugar prices. At the end of April, the sugar price in Shanghai was over 50,000 yuan per picul. After the company's manipulation, the sugar price rose to 140,000 yuan this month, an increase of more than doubled. According to the company, the cost plus freight is only 50,000 yuan, and the original profit is divided between the Resources Committee and Taiwan with four parts going to the "Provincial Government" and six to the "Resources Committee", feeding the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital. The company has a huge amount of US dollars as capital for speculation and profiteering, and the person in charge claimed that 100,000 bags of Taiwan sugar will be shipped to Shanghai for dumping. According to people in the sugar industry, under the circumstances of the company's dumping and the large-scale import of sugar from Cuba, the Netherlands, and other countries, the future of private sugar industries such as Sichuan sugar and Jiangnan sugar production is worrying.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Shanghai Report: The local Sugar Industry Association, in view of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's monopoly of the market, manipulation of sugar prices, and exploitation of sugar merchants' operating rights, held a meeting at the beginning of this month and decided to submit a document to the government authorities requesting the abolition of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. They will organize a sugar industry petition delegation to go to Nanjing to petition and appeal to the National Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and various trade associations for support.

    独占上海糖业市场
    糖业界要求撤销台湾糖业公司
    【新华社延安二十日电】沪讯：行政院资源委员会与台湾公署合办的糖业托拉斯——台湾糖业公司，自五月二十二日成立以来，即大量以极低价格收购台蔗，剥削蔗农，并大量以其产糖运沪倾销，乘糖荒之机，操纵抬高糖价。四月底沪市糖价市担值五万余元，经该公司操纵后，本月中糖价涨至十四万元，上涨到过一倍。按该公司成本连运费不过五万元，所得原利悉由资委会与台湾以四“署方”六“资委”折账，喂肥了国民党官僚资本。该公司拥有巨额美金作投机发财的本钱，且负责人声称将有十万包台湾糖陆续至沪倾销。据糖业界人士谈：在该公司的倾销及古巴、荷兰等国的食糖大量进口的形势下，民营糖业如川糖及江南糖产的前途至堪忧虑。
    【新华社延安三十日电】沪讯：此间糖业公会，以台湾糖业公司独占市场，操纵糖价，剥削糖商经营权利，于本月初集会，决定呈文要求政府当局撤销台糖公司，组织糖业请愿团赴京请愿，吁请全国商联筹备会、沪市商会及各同业公会声援。
