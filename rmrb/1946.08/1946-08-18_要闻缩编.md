    Moscow, August 14th broadcast: The Chicago Daily Tribune's reporter in Beiping reported: When he spoke with U.S. Marines, the American soldiers said: The CCP's just demand for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China is not recognized by them as a continuation of Roosevelt's policy of interfering in China's internal affairs. The reporter stated: Some U.S. Marines believe that there is no reason to continue stationing troops in China, and the U.S. military presence in China is just like the situation of British troops stationed in the United States during the American Civil War.
