　　Victory Breakout
    Interview with General Fang Shengpu
    At noon on the 29th, we visited Deputy Brigade Commander Fang Shengpu with feelings warmer than the July sun. He, along with Brigade Commander Pi Dingjun, led thousands of brave soldiers, broke through the heavy blockade of the Chiang army from the Dabie Mountains, crossed the Hefei-Yeji Highway, Huainan Highway, and Jinpu Railway, and marched over a thousand miles to reach the Suwan Liberated Area.

    Although he had gone through more than twenty days of fighting and marching, Deputy Brigade Commander Fang was full of energy and showed no signs of fatigue. After understanding our purpose, he warmly shook hands with us, led us to his room, and invited us to sit at a rectangular table. He readily opened a tattered pocket map on the table and began to speak frankly.

    "Before the breakout, the Central Plains troops were active in the Dabie Mountains. This area is about two hundred miles long from east to west and fifty to sixty miles wide from north to south, and is strictly blockaded on all sides. The Chiang army besieging us numbered 400,000, all commanded by Liu Zhi. The reactionaries deployed three lines of blockade east of the Dabie Mountains: the first was a fortress line, with their sentries facing our sentries across the mountains. The second was the line of Huangchuan, Gushi, and Lihuang, and the third was the Huainan Highway and the Hefei-Yeji Highway. The main force of the Chiang army pressed against our army from the northeast, attempting to force our main force to withdraw from the mountains and annihilate it in the plains. The reactionaries made a wishful calculation and launched a general offensive on June 26. However, we saw through the reactionaries' conspiracy and poisonous plan, and our Central Plains troops unexpectedly and decisively broke through in separate directions. Our brigade was ordered to transfer south of Shangcheng and Guangshan, and was immediately attacked fiercely by the Chiang army. After fierce fighting, we broke through the first line of defense of the Chiang army, and then fought against the Chiang army blocking us near Macheng. Then we walked and fought, intermittently and never stopped. After crossing the natural danger of Songziguan on the border of Hubei and Anhui, we entered Dahua Township via Wujiadian, east of Huangchuan River. We smashed the encirclement of the 4th Regiment of the Anhui Security Force, crossed the Mozi Pool, which was as deep as our necks. Although enemy bullets were flying on the surface of the water, they could not stop us from advancing. Later, we went north from Mao Yuanchang and Henggutan between Shucheng and Huoshan, and crossed the Hefei-Yeji Highway at Guanting on July 10. When we reached the Huainan Highway, we were again blocked by a part of the 138th Division of the Gui system troops in Xiatangji. In Zhujiawan and Shajian in Dingyuan, we smashed the blockade of the puppet army Sun Liangcheng. At dawn on July 20, we rushed across the Jinpu Road and fought against the 138th Division of the Gui army intercepting us near Jiashanbian Station. This battle was the largest and most fierce. The Chiang army used armored vehicles to cover the train, and continuously reinforced it. We fought while covering the rearguard troops. By sunrise, all of us had safely crossed the road. A particularly heroic scene was our soldiers climbing the moving Chiang army armored train regardless of their own safety." Deputy Brigade Commander Fang said with a smile, "We threw grenades like a storm into the carriages, and the Chiang army inside screamed incessantly. Although their casualties could not be counted, it is estimated that few could survive."

    How was this unit commanded? Deputy Brigade Commander Fang said: "In order to travel lightly and facilitate marching, we didn't bring anything, not even a military map. We only relied on two things to determine the breakout route: this only pocket map and a compass. In order to grasp the direction and command the battle, Brigade Commander Pi and I walked at the forefront of the troops for more than twenty days and nights. Fortunately, we didn't take a wrong turn once." Deputy Brigade Commander Fang said: "The weather was hot and there was a lot of rain along the way, and some difficulties occurred. But due to the iron revolutionary will of officers and soldiers seeking peace and survival, we finally overcame everything. In every 24 hours, there can only be one or two hours of rest in the middle of the night. The brutal Chiang army was ready to attack us from all directions at any time. As soon as there was enemy information, as soon as the gunfire rang, everyone was energetic and excited. The soldiers said, "When fighting, we are full of energy, and we don't feel sleepy!" We passed through many high mountains, dense forests and narrow passes. From Songziguan to Dahua Township, life was the most difficult. The mountains are big and the villages are small, and there is a shortage of food. For a few days, we could only eat one meal a day. Sometimes the vanguard can eat a meal, but the rearguard has nothing to eat. Sometimes we can only buy some melons and corn from the common people and eat them raw. Sometimes there is nothing, so we can only drink some cold water to satisfy our hunger. ...In short, the hardships are endless, even a night of sleep and a full meal are rare. However, we did not bow our heads to difficulties, we conquered all difficulties, just as we defeated the reactionaries who attacked us along the way."

    Deputy Brigade Commander Fang said excitedly: "Along the way, the Chiang army collapsed at the first touch, and their combat effectiveness was weak. Our army suffered more than 30 casualties, but the Chiang army suffered at least 30 times more casualties than our army. Our brigade has completed the task assigned to us by our superiors. Now Zhang Tixue's East Hubei Independent Brigade and our brigade's guerrilla troops are still fighting for peace and democracy in Lihuang, Yingru, Yuexi, Qianshan, Taihu and other places under the Dabie Mountains. The troops that broke out to the west are advancing victoriously. We want to tell the enemy: the Communist army cannot be wiped out or surrounded. It will create history and create miracles. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, victory will surely belong to us."

    Deputy Brigade Commander Fang's forceful tone stopped abruptly here. Two hours of conversation, a great historical trace was engraved on the reporter's heart. I silently pay my highest respect to thousands of combat heroes!

　　胜利突围
    方升普将军访问记
    二十九日正午，我们怀着比七月的阳光更热的感情，去访问刚从中原突围出来胜利到达苏皖解放区的方副旅长升普将军。他是和旅长皮定钧将军一同率领数千健儿，从大别山冲破蒋军重重封锁，穿过合叶公路、淮南公路、津浦铁路，徒步长征千余里而到达此间的。
    虽然经过二十余天战斗行军，但方副旅长精神饱满，毫无倦容。当他了解我们的来意后，亲切地和我们紧握着手，把我们引到他的房间，请我们在一张长方桌边坐下。他顺手在桌上翻开一本破烂的袖珍地图，就开始侃侃而谈了。
    “中原部队在突围前，都在大别山上活动。这个地区东西长约二百里，南北宽五六十里，四面八方都被严密封锁。围攻我们的蒋军有四十万，都由刘峙指挥。反动派在大别山以东就布置三道封锁线：第一道是堡垒线，其哨兵与我们哨兵隔山相望。第二道为潢川、固始、立煌一线，第三道是淮南公路与合叶公路。蒋军主力从东北方向我军压迫，企图迫使我主力退出山地，在平原地区一举歼灭。反动派打好了如意算盘，便于六月二十六日开始总攻。可是我们窥破了反动派的阴谋毒计，我中原部队乃出其不意，毅然决然分路突围，我们这一旅受命向商城、光山以南转移，当日即遭蒋军猛烈攻击，经激战后突破蒋军第一道防线，继在麻城附近和堵击的蒋军打起来。接着边打边走，断断续续从未休止。越过鄂皖边界松子关天险之后，经吴家店潢川河东，进入大化坪。我们打垮了皖保安第四团的包围，渡过深及头颈的磨子潭，敌人子弹虽在水面上飞舞，但亦无法阻止我们前进。后由舒城、霍山之间的毛垣厂、恒古潭向北，七月十日于官亭穿过合（肥）叶（家集）公路，到了淮南公路，在下塘集又遭桂系部队一三八师一部堵击。在定远之朱家湾、沙涧等地，打垮伪军孙良诚的堵击。七月二十日拂晓，冲过津浦路，在嘉山边站附近和截击的桂军一三八师作战，这一仗规模最大也最激烈。蒋军用装甲车掩护火车，不断增援。我们一面作战，一面掩护后卫部队。至日出时，全部安然过路。特别英勇的一幕是我们的战士奋不顾身攀登开动中的蒋军装甲火车。”方副旅长带着微笑说：“把手榴弹像暴风雨一般的投向车厢，里面的蒋军嚎叫不已。他们的伤亡虽无法统计，但估计能够生还的不多”。
    这一支部队是怎样指挥的呢？方副旅长说：“我们为了轻装便于行军，什么都没有带，连一张军用地图都没有。我们只靠两件东西确定突围路线，便是这唯一的一本袖珍的地图和一部指南针。为了掌握方针，指挥战斗，二十几昼夜我与皮旅长都是走在部队的最前头。幸而我们没走过一次错路。”方副旅长说：“一路上天气热，雨水多，曾发生一些困难。但由于官兵一致的求和平求生存的铁的革命意志，终于战胜了一切。在每天二十四小时中，只能有夜半一两个钟头的休息。残暴的蒋军，就在四面八方随时都准备打击我们。只要一有敌情，枪声一响，便个个精神百倍，兴奋起来。战士们说：“一打仗浑身都是劲儿，瞌睡就不来了！”我们经过不少高山密林隘道。从松子关到大化坪，生活最苦，山大村小，粮食缺少，有几天一天只能吃一顿。有时前卫能吃到一顿，后卫就没得吃。有时只能向老百姓买点瓜和玉米之类生吃。有时不论啥都没有，只能喝点冷水充饥。……总之，困苦是谈不尽的，即便是一夜的安眠，一顿饱饭都是不可多得的。但是，我们没有向困难低头，我们征服了一切困难，也正如打垮沿途攻击我们的反动派一样。”
    方副旅长兴奋的说：“一路上打仗，蒋军都是一触即垮，战斗力低弱。我军共伤亡三十余人，但蒋军伤亡至少三十倍于我军。我们这一旅已经完成了上级给我们的任务，现在我鄂东独立旅张体学部及我旅的游击部队，仍在大别山下立煌、英如、岳西、潜山、太湖等地为和平民主而坚持斗争。向西突围部队正胜利的前进。我们要告诉敌人：共产党部队是消灭不了包围不了的，他会创造历史，创造奇迹。在毛泽东的旗帜下，胜利必然是属于我们的。”
    方副旅长有力的语调到这里截然停止了。两个钟头的谈话，一段伟大的史迹刻上了记者的心头。我在默默中向数千个战斗英雄们致以崇高的敬意！
