Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 23rd: The Kuomintang reactionaries, using the Guo Ziqi incident as a pretext to detain General Huang Zhen, the Communist representative of the Xinxiang group, and Lieutenant Colonel Guo Jin, have been confirmed to be acting on the orders of Zheng Jiemin, a Kuomintang commissioner of the Executive Headquarters, and Liu Zhi, the director of Zhengzhou. According to a report from the American side of the Executive Headquarters, Wang Zhonglian, Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang 11th Army Group, stated: "He guarantees that General Huang and others have nothing to do with Guo Ziqi's death and guarantees the safety of the Communist members of the group, but he cannot lift their 'restrictions' because these 'restrictions' were ordered by Commissioner Zheng Jiemin and Director Liu Zhi." Therefore, the lives and safety of General Huang Zhen and others are now in an extremely dangerous state, and they have been deprived of their freedom for more than a month. Zheng Jiemin, as the highest Kuomintang official in the Executive Headquarters, issuing such absurd orders is a typical example of disobeying Order No. 7 and sabotaging mediation work. Note: Incidents of the Kuomintang persecuting Communist personnel in the executive groups have been common. From February to August, there have been 40 instances of deliberate obstruction and searching, 5 instances of beating and insulting Communist representatives and members, 18 instances of imprisonment and robbery, 5 instances of shooting and shelling, and 5 instances of kidnapping and assassination. Xin Guanwu and Ma Jinyuan, among others, have lost their lives as a result, while Gan Chongdou, Wu Wuhan, and Wang Tinglan, among others, have been injured. Wang Baoyu and Hu Yuzhong, among others, remain missing.

　　郑介民破坏调处
    黄镇少将竟遭扣押新乡
    【新华社延安二十三日电】国民党反动派借口郭子祺事件扣押新乡小组中共代表黄镇将军与郭瑾中校，证实系执行部蒋方委员郑介民及郑州所指主任刘峙之命令。据执行部美方报告：国民党十一集团军总司令王仲廉称：“担保黄将军等与郭子祺之死无关，并担保小组共方组员之安全，但不能解除彼等之‘限制’，因该项‘限制’系郑介民委员及刘峙主任所下之命令。”因此黄镇将军等之生命安全现处于极端危险状态，彼等失去自由已月余。郑介民身为执行部国民党方面最高负责人，而下如此荒谬之命令，实为违抗和字七号命令破坏调处工作的典型。按：蒋方迫害执行组中共人员事件已屡见不鲜，从二月至八月计故意留难阻挠搜查达四十次，殴打辱骂中共代表及组员五次，监禁抢劫十八次，枪击炮轰五次，绑架暗杀五次，为此而丧失生命者有辛冠五、马金元等人，受伤者有甘重斗、吴武汉、王廷兰等人，迄今生死不明者有王保愚、胡舆中等人。
