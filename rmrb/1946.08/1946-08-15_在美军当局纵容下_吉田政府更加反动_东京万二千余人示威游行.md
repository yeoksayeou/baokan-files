    The Yoshida Government Becomes More Reactionary
    Over 12,000 People Demonstrate in Tokyo
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: Moscow dispatch: The Soviet "Red Fleet" newspaper published an article on the 7th stating that the Japanese government still does not fulfill the basic conditions of surrender. The Yoshida government has not only continued the policies of the Shidehara government, but also carried out fierce struggles to oppose democratic forces. The article expressed dissatisfaction with the US military occupation authorities' neglect of this matter. The article concluded by stating that for the sake of peace in the Far East, it is necessary to implement the Potsdam Declaration, eradicate Japanese militarism, and establish a democratic country.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: Tokyo dispatch: On the afternoon of the 9th, over 12,000 Japanese people held two demonstrations in the streets of Tokyo. One was in sympathy with the Yomiuri Shimbun strikers, with an estimated 10,000 participants; the other was by movie theater workers protesting against government tax increases. Thousands of sympathizers from more than forty labor unions surrounded the area near Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo's third-largest newspaper, blocking the road.
