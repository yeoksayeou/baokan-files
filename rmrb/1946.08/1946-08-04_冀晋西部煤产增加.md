Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 28th—The western Hebei-Shanxi region, with its continuous Taihang and Wutai Mountains, is rich in coal and iron ore deposits. In the past year, thanks to the encouragement and support of the democratic government, more than 500 new and restored small and medium-sized coal mines have emerged. With changes in business practices, improved worker treatment, and improved labor-management relations, production has soared. Annual production can reach more than 120 million catties. There are 175 coal mines in Pingtung, producing 2.8 million catties of coal per day; 24 in Yuci, producing 650,000 catties per day; 89 in Meng County, producing 600,000 catties per day; 36 in Wutai, producing 590,000 catties per day; 17 in Quyang, producing 200,000 catties per day; and one in Fuping, producing 150,000 catties per day. Other counties such as Yangqu, Shouyang, and Lingqiu also produce more than 5 million catties of coal per day. In addition to supplying the needs of the masses in this region, more than 60% of this coal production can be exported in exchange for other daily necessities.
