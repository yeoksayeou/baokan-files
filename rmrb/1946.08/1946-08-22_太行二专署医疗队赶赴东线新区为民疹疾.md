　　The Taihang Second Special District Medical Team Rushes to Eastern New District to Treat People's Diseases
    [This newspaper's Changzhi, 15th dispatch] After the Yan puppet troops fled from the Dongqin Line, our Second Special District Office and Wuxiang County Government dispatched personnel to the newly liberated areas along the Wu-Qi Line to investigate the disaster situation and provide relief. It was discovered that the local epidemic was extremely serious, with 90% of the population suffering from diseases, mostly typhoid fever, malaria, dysentery, syphilis, scabies, etc. They immediately telegraphed the Second Special District Medical Team to provide treatment. The Jindong Hospital of the Second Special District and the Wuxiang Dazhong Hospital immediately formed a medical team to rush to the disaster area for free treatment. In the villages along the line of the Eighth District of Wuxiang alone, 94 people have been cured. The local people expressed their gratitude, saying: "The Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the democratic government have cured our diseases and saved our lives." Because there are too many patients, Dazhong Hospital has organized two more medical teams to cooperate in the work.

　　太行二专署医疗队赶赴东线新区为民疹疾
    【本报长治十五日讯】东沁线阎伪军逃窜后，我二专署及武乡县府即分别派员驰赴武、祁沿线新解放区调查灾情，抚恤救济，发现当地时疫极为严重，患病者占人口百分之九十，多为伤寒，疟疾、痢疾、梅毒、疥疮等病，当即电请二专署医疗队前往施诊，二专区晋东医院与武乡大众医院立即合组一医疗队，赶赴灾区免费治疗。仅武乡八区所属沿线村庄，已被治愈九十四人，当地人民都同声感激地说：“共产党八路军和民主政府治了我们的病，救了我们的命。”现因患病者太多，大众医院特再组织两个医疗队配合工作。
