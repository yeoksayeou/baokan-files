Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. A Chiang Kai-shek plane harassed the skies over Yan'an city at 11:00 am today. The plane flew in from the direction of Ganquan. This is the second time Chiang's planes have harassed Yan'an city since bombing the Yan'an headquarters on August 2nd. The first time was at 4:00 pm on the 13th. The lies of the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense spokesman and Peng Xuepei, who claimed it was solely to bomb the plane flown by Liu Shanben after bombing the Yan'an headquarters, have been exposed by these two consecutive harassments of Yan'an.

　　蒋机袭扰延安
    【新华社延安十九日电】蒋机一架于今日上午十一时袭扰延市上空。该机自甘泉方向飞来，此系蒋机于八月二日轰炸延安总部后继续袭扰延安市之第二次。第一次为十三日午后四时，国民党国防部发言人与彭学沛等于轰炸延安总部后声称系专炸刘善本驾来之飞机的谎言，已为其连续二次袭扰延安所揭穿。
