　　The Story of Little Shandong's Transformation
    ——An Example of Reforming Prisoners at Zhangjiakou Prison

    Twenty-two-year-old Zhu Yuancai had already been a thief for thirteen years. He was from Penglai, Shandong. He lost his father at six and his mother at seven, leaving this orphan without any affection in the world, drifting into beggary. At the age of nine, he stole two silver dollars from a paternal relative and secretly jumped onto a sailboat crossing the Bohai Bay, escaping to Dalian, thus beginning his thieving career. Here, he found a group of companions. During the day, they stole things to fill their bellies; at night, they slept on the streets, hunger forcing them to steal even more. During his first winter in Dalian, they began stealing from the courtyards of wealthy people. Although young, Zhu Yuancai was bold. He would always sneak deep into the inner rooms late at night, carrying out large packages from the window and handing them to his companions. However, he didn’t demand a larger share of the loot despite doing the most dangerous work. Therefore, his companions respected him and gave him a friendly nickname, "Little Shandong."

    When "Little Shandong" was eleven years old, he became addicted to opium. It quickly ruined his health. His sworn brother, Ma Bikan, advised him to quit. He agreed and asked his friends to tie him to a tree, not allowing anyone to untie him for three whole days, thus breaking his opium addiction. At fourteen, he was imprisoned in Dalian once. Afterwards, he fled to Beijing and then to Datong. At seventeen, he escaped to Zhangjiakou and stayed between there and Beijing, making a living as a thief.

    Shortly after the liberation of Zhangjiakou, Zhu Yuancai was reported and sentenced to one year of imprisonment. As in the past, he thought that as long as he spent some money in prison and stayed for a few months, he could get out and resume his "divine hand" career. But this time, Zhu Yuancai encountered new problems. First, no one put shackles or handcuffs on him; no one beat or scolded him; and no one asked him for money. The millet he ate was clean and fragrant. The prison cells were painted snow-white, much cleaner than the places he had lived outside. Many prisoners happily went to work after eating. They were given lessons every day, discussing national affairs, the darkness of the old society, and the benefits of labor. The prison had loudspeakers broadcasting news all day long… All of this confused Zhu Yuancai. What was going on? A few days later, Director Liu of the prison guards had a long talk with him, telling him that the democratic government's prison was a place to heal and save people. He explained that being a thief was mainly caused by the oppression of the old society, and that as long as he could reform, he could still be a good person… Zhu Yuancai listened very carefully. Director Liu's sincere and caring attitude deeply moved him. He felt that since his parents died, no one had cared for him so warmly. He felt that these words were all for his own good. He didn't sleep all night, thinking that it was indeed time for him to reform.

    When Zhu Yuancai arrived at the construction team, Director Liu saw that his shoes were almost worn out and immediately issued him a new pair. The captain of the construction team was Director Liu himself. He often talked to Zhu Yuancai, caring about his life. Zhu Yuancai felt that Director Liu was like a relative to him. He told him everything about his past deeds. Director Liu also told him many stories about the liberated areas. Zhu Yuancai then resolved to change.

    When carrying white soil, others carried one basket, but he discussed with his partner to carry two baskets. While others returned with empty baskets, Zhu Yuancai carried yellow soil back to "mix the mud." Later, others followed Zhu Yuancai and carried two baskets, but he added another basket, running out and running back. Zhu Yuancai developed a large boil on his arm and his hands were blistered. Director Liu advised him to rest, but he said, "It's okay, it will be fine in a few days." Sure enough, it was all healed in half a month. His arm didn't hurt anymore, a layer of calluses grew on his hands, and he felt particularly strong. Everyone in the construction team admired him and elected him as the group leader. This spring, Zhu Yuancai led a construction team of nearly twenty people to work on Xuanhua Avenue, Yi'an Street, and other places. These places were six *li* away from the prison, and no one from the prison followed them. They went out in the morning and returned in the evening, and no one ever ran away. Because Zhu Yuancai reformed well, the local court decided to release him early, but Zhu Yuancai did not want to leave. He asked the government for a job. Thus, Zhu Yuancai officially became a prison guard in May of this year. Zhu Yuancai's work involved mainly dealing with petty thieves, and of course, all the tricks of the trade could not be hidden from him. Now, many of the petty thieves in Zhangjiakou Prison are Zhu Yuancai's former companions. Recently, in order to more effectively reform petty thieves, the prison specially established a transformation team, led by Zhu Yuancai. This transformation team lives in a separate room with freedom of movement. The walls are covered with slogans such as "Learn from Zhu Yuancai." Dai Gongfeng, a well-known thief leader in Zhangjiakou, has also transformed. He is a junior high school graduate. At a confession meeting of more than a hundred people, Dai Gongfeng was so moved that tears streamed down his face. He said, "Think about it, who would care for us like this except for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army!?"

　　小山东转变的故事
    ——张市监狱改造犯人的范例
    二十二岁的朱元才，已是做过十三年小偷的人了。他是山东蓬莱人，六岁失父，六岁丧母，于是这个孤儿就失去了人间的一切爱抚，流落为乞儿了。九岁时他偷了同族伯父的两块大洋，偷偷的跳上了一只横渡渤海湾的帆船，逃到大连，从此开始了他的偷盗生涯。在这里他找到了一群伙伴，白天他们偷东西满肚子；夜间睡在大街上，饥寒迫使他们去偷更多的东西。当他到大连市的第一个冬天，他们就开始到大财主们的院子里去偷了。朱元才年龄虽小胆子可大，他总是在深更半夜里深入内室，把老大的包袱从窗户背出递给他的伙伴，但他并不因为自己干的事情最危险，就把偷的东西多分给自己，因此同伴们都很看起他，给他起了一个亲切的外号“小山东”。
    “小山东”十一岁那年就学上了白面瘾，很快就把身体搞坏了。他的把哥马闭堪劝他戒白面，他答应了，就叫朋友们把他缚在一棵树上，整整三天不让别人给他解绳子，这样把白面瘾戒掉了。十四岁他在大连坐了一次牢，以后就逃到了北平，又到了大同。十七岁时逃到了张家口，就一直在这里和北平两地，当小偷糊口。
    张家口解放不久，朱元才被告发了，判一年徒刑。他和过去一样，心里想着只要到监里花几个钱，住几个月就可以出来，好重过“神手”生涯。但是朱元才这一次却碰见了新问题。首先没有人给他带脚镣和手铐，没有人打骂他，更没有人向他要钱。吃的小米又干净，又香，监房内刷的雪白，比自己在外面住的地方卫生的多，很多犯人吃过饭就很愉快的去劳动，每天给上课，讲国家大事和旧社会的黑暗，以及劳动的好处等，监内整天有播音机放送新闻，……这一切使朱元才迷糊了。这是怎么一回事呢？不几天，刘看守主任找他长长的谈了一次，告诉他现在民主政府的监狱，就是一个治病救人的场所，并且向他解释了过去当小偷主要是旧社会逼迫的，只要今后能够改过，还仍然是一个好人，……朱元才非常用心的听着，刘主任那种诚恳而关心的态度深深的感动了他，他感到从父母死后，还没有人这样亲切地关心过他，他感到这些话都是为他自己着想的。这样他有一整夜不睡觉，他想着自己确是已经到了改过的时候。
    朱元才到了建筑队，刘主任看见他的鞋子快坏了，立刻给他发了一对新鞋。建筑队的队长就是刘主任，他常找朱元才谈话，关心他的生活，朱元才感到刘主任简直就是自己的亲人，把过去干的事一五一十的都说了出来，刘主任又给他讲了许多解放区的故事给他听，朱元才才下决心转变了。
    抬白土别人抬一筐，他同对手商量抬两筐，别的回来是空筐，朱元才回来的时候抬上黄土准备“和泥”。后来别人也跟着朱元才抬两筐，他就又加上一筐，跑着出去跑着回来。朱元才膀子上起了一个大疸，手上磨出了血，刘主任劝他休息，他说：“不要紧，过几天就会好的。”果然半个月以后全好了，膀子也不痛了，手上磨起了一层硬皮，身上也特别有劲起来，全建筑队的人都佩服他，选他为小组长。今年春天，朱元才领导一个将近二十人的建筑队，到宣化大道，怡安街等处去做工，这些地方离监狱六里地远，监狱里没有一个人跟着他们，早上出去，晚上回来，从来没有人逃跑过。由于朱元才转变的好，地方法院决定提前释放他，可是朱元才不出去，他要求政府给职业。这样朱元才便从今年五月起正式成为监狱看守员了。朱元才的工作对象主要是小偷犯，这一行要的一切鬼把戏当然都瞒不过他。现在张家口市监狱小偷犯当中，很多都是朱元才过去的同伴。最近监狱为了更有效的改造小偷，特别成立一个转变队，由朱元才当队长。这个转变队另住一室，出入自由，墙壁上贴满了“向朱元才学习”等标语，张家口著名小偷头子戴工风，也转变了。他是一个初中毕业生，在一百多人的坦白大会上，戴工风感动得热泪横流，他说：“想一想，除了共产党、八路军，谁这样关心过我们呢！？”
