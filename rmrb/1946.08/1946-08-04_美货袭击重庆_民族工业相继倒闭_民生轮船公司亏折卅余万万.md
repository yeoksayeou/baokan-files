Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: American goods are pouring into the interior from Shanghai, and Chongqing's national industry and commerce are in dire straits. After the dumping of American cigarettes, 80% of the local cigarette factories have closed down. With the arrival of daily-use cosmetics, the chemical industry has also collapsed one after another. Due to the large number of glass and silk products shipped from Shanghai, the silk and cloth industry is in a state of panic. According to the statistics of the Chongqing Direct Taxation Bureau, 137 private factories and 107 large companies and firms closed down in May and June. Market transactions of more than 100 million yuan in May and June were very rare. From Qingnian Road to Xiaoshizi Road, 13 foreign sundry goods and clothing companies announced their closure or transfer in the second half of June alone. Tax revenue decreased by two-fifths, reflecting the extremely serious depression of industry and commerce. Furthermore, it is reported that Peiping (now Beijing), the ancient capital, has begun to be attacked by American goods. Cheap goods such as American Cream of Wheat have appeared in Bao'an Market and Wangfudajie. The windows of department stores are full of glass products, called "Glass World."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: It is reported that Mr. Lu Zuofu, General Manager of Minsheng Company, rushed to Nanjing on July 9th to make an urgent appeal to all parties for relief. This is because the company has been operating on the Yichang-Chongqing section recently, with very little transportation of local goods, all dispatched by the Kuomintang authorities. On July 7th, Chiang Kai-shek sent another urgent telegram to Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Kuomintang military and political organs stationed in Chongqing, "ordering Minsheng Company to stop all commercial cargo and passenger transportation and to devote all its efforts to transporting Sichuan grain out of Sichuan." The company has already lost more than 3 billion yuan due to military service in the five months from January to June this year. If this appeal does not receive concrete relief measures, it will inevitably close down and suspend business.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Kaifeng News: The Kuomintang garrison in Henan Province numbers 870,000, with extensive requisitions. The Kuomintang Central Government only allocated military grain for 380,000 people, leaving the remaining 490,000 to disturb the people on their own, placing a heavy burden on military grain. According to a public report by the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs in early July, supplementary food expenses and horse fodder expenses alone amounted to more than 630,000 yuan per month. In addition to the salaries and grain of the provincial and county teams, the people of Henan, suffering from wind, rain, hail, insects, fog, water, and locust plagues, could not bear it. Some provincial assembly members organized a crying delegation in late June to petition the authorities in Nanjing to reduce the burden on the people, but no results have been seen so far.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Shanghai News: More than 500 civil servants from over ten units directly under the Kuomintang Central Government, including the Cargo Direct Depot and the Tax Bureau, have repeatedly telegraphed the authorities to improve their living conditions due to high living pressure, but have not received a reply. They are preparing to start a general leave of absence and will hold a press conference on the 12th to report on their difficult living conditions. Furthermore, it is reported that accounting personnel from various units under the Xiamen Municipal Government jointly signed a petition to the mayor on the 10th, requesting ten days of leave in order to beg from door to door due to rising prices. After receiving the petition, the mayor, Hong Da, opposed the initiative and dismissed and reported him, which has caused widespread dissatisfaction.

　　美货袭击重庆
    民族工业相继倒闭
    民生轮船公司亏折卅余万万
    【新华社延安一日电】美货源源由沪倾销内地，重庆民族工商业一蹶不振。美国香烟倾销后，当地纸烟厂百分之八十已告关门，日用化妆品到达后，化学工业也纷纷倒闭，而由于玻璃、绸类大量由沪运来，绸布业已大起恐慌。据重庆直接税局统计：五六两月份倒闭民营工厂达一百三十七家，大公司行号共达一百零七家。五六两月一亿元以上之市场交易已甚少，由青年路到小什子路，仅六月下半月就有十三家洋杂百货服装公司宣布歇业或招顶，税收减少竟达五分之二，反映出工商业之凋敝，极为严重。又讯：故都北平已开始受到美货袭击，美国克宁奴粉等廉价货，已出现保安市场、王府大街，百货店窗槛放满玻璃制品，号曰“玻璃世界”。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】据讯：民生公司总经理卢作孚氏，于七月九日匆匆赴南京向各方作紧急呼吁，请求救济。因该公司最近在宜渝段行驶，绝少运输土货，全由国民党当局调派。于上月七日，蒋介石复急电国民党军政机关驻渝办事处主任朱绍良，“责成民生公司停止一切商货人客载运，全力启运川粮出川。该公司自今年一月至六月五个月内，已因军差亏折三十余亿元之巨。此次呼吁若得不到具体救济办法，势必关门停业。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】开封讯：河南国民党驻军达八十七万，征用浩繁，国民党中央只按三十八万人配给军粮，余四十余万人任其自行扰民，军粮负担至重。据省民政厅于七月上旬公开报告称：仅副食费及马干费，每月赔出即达六十三万余元，加以省县团队的饷粮，使在风雨雹虫雾水蝗等灾之下的河南人民，不堪忍受。该省一部参议员于六月下旬为此组织哭诉团，至宁请求当局减轻民负，至今未见结果。
    【新华社延安一日电】沪讯：国民党中央直属机关货物直栈税局等十余单位公务员五百余名，因受生活高压，屡次电请当局改善生活待遇未获答复，已准备开始总请假，并于十二日招待新闻界，报告生活艰困情形。另讯：厦门市府所属各单位会计人员因物价高涨，于十日联名签呈市长给假十天，以便沿门求乞，市长接呈后，反对主动人洪达，撤职检举，已引起普遍不满。
