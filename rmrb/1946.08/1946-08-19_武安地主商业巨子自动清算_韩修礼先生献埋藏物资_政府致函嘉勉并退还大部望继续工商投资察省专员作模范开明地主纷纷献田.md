[Handan, 16th Dispatch] Mr. Han Xiuli, a landlord and business tycoon in Wu'an City, recently donated a large quantity of materials worth 130 million yuan (legal tender), which he had buried underground for eight years during the enemy and puppet regime period. The materials included 400 barrels of kerosene, more than 160 bolts of foreign cloth, more than 100 bolts of homespun cloth, 68 barrels of block indigo and water indigo, more than 8,000 silver yuan, 20,000 catties of copper coins, 3,000 catties of alum, and 3,000 catties of alkali. He requested the government to transfer these items to the masses to settle the feudal exploitation accounts of his family in the past. Han's family had been in business for three generations and was a well-known landlord and commercial capitalist in Wu'an City, having run foreign cloth stores and money shops for many years. Since the launch of the mass movement of "Land to the Tillers," Han deeply understood the various facts of his family's past exploitation of the masses. He voluntarily liquidated his assets and resolutely donated all the materials to repay the masses' blood and sweat debts, causing a sensation throughout the city, with people talking about it and spreading the news. The Wu'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County Government, after careful discussion and extensive solicitation of opinions from the masses, immediately sent a letter to Mr. Han expressing their commendation, stating: "Welcoming private investment in the development of industry and commerce is a consistent policy of the democratic government. With the consent of the masses, apart from using a very small portion of the materials donated by Mr. Han to compensate the masses, the vast majority will be returned to Mr. Han, with the hope that he can use them to establish industrial and commercial enterprises and promote the development of the New Democratic economy." At the same time, it called on all businessmen in the county to learn from Han and invest all frozen assets in industry and commerce to generate profits. Mr. Han stated to the people afterwards: "I deeply feel the authenticity of the democratic government's policies and the rationality of the mass movement. Therefore, I handed over these items to the masses to compensate for past losses. The government's leniency and the masses' forgiveness have deeply moved me. I am determined to use this batch of materials to open a machine spinning mill and, with the help of the government and the masses, jointly benefit society."

[Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 14th Dispatch] Many enlightened landlords in Chahar Province have successively donated land. Chai Shulin, Commissioner of the Seventh Administrative Office of Chahar North and a member of the Chinese Communist Party, persuaded his grandfather to distribute 3,800 mu of ancestral land in Zhangbei and Kangbao to farmers for cultivation. Together with the 500 mu of land donated this spring to help disaster victims, he has donated a total of 4,200 mu of land. In Xidaimei Village, Zhangbei, 150 tenant households received an average of more than seven mu of land. Chai's relatives, Song Yujin and Song Yurui, and three other enlightened gentry members of the Song family, a prominent family in Chahar North, also promoted this glorious family tradition. After retaining sufficient land for their own cultivation, they successively donated more than 4,900 mu of land. When farmers in various places received land, they held enthusiastic gatherings to celebrate and sent letters to Commissioner Chai, expressing their great gratitude to him for his heroic dedication to the cause of national liberation over the past eight years and for now donating land to help farmers to stand up. They all believed that the Communist Party is truly the savior of the peasants. Dong Defeng, an enlightened landlord in Zhuolu Xin'anbao, happily told his friends after donating 278 mu of fertile land and 68 houses: "The landlord class relies on farmers to live a life of extravagance and pleasure, which is a great injustice in history. Now, living by my own management is much more pleasant." Liu Shengzhuan, a government supervisor, retained 15 mu of land for his family of six to cultivate themselves, and distributed all the remaining 110 mu of rented land to poor farmers for cultivation.

　　武安地主商业巨子自动清算
    韩修礼先生献埋藏物资
    政府致函嘉勉并退还大部望继续工商投资察省专员作模范开明地主纷纷献田
    【邯郸十六日电】武安城地主兼商业界巨子韩修礼先生，于日前将其在敌伪统治时期埋藏地下八年的价值一万万三千万元（法币）的大批物资，计煤油四百桶，洋布百六十余匹，土布百余匹，块靛及水靛六十八桶，银洋八千余元，铜元二万斤，白矾三千斤，碱三千斤等献出，请政府转给群众，清算其家庭过去的封建剥削账目。韩三代营商，为武安城内著名的地主兼商业资本家，开设洋布庄、钱庄多年。自耕者有其田的群众翻身运动开展以来，韩深明自己的家庭过去对群众剥削的种种事实，自动清算，毅然献出全部物资，偿还群众的血汗债，一时轰动全城，街谈巷议纷纷传颂。中共武安县委及县府于经过慎重讨论，并广泛征求群众意见，当即致函韩先生表示嘉勉，并称：“欢迎私人投资发展工商业，乃民主政府一贯政策。现经群众同意，除以先生所献物资之极小部分偿还群众外，其余绝大部分仍退还先生，望能以之兴办工商实业，推进新民主主义经济发展。”同时并号召全县商人向韩学习，把冻结资财都投入工商业中生利。韩先生事后向人民表示：“我深感民主政府政策的真实与群众运动的合理，故以此物交还群众以偿往日损失。政府之宽大与群众的原宥使我深深感动。我决心以这批物资开办一机器纺纱，在政府与群众帮助下共同造福于社会。”
    【新华社宣化十四日电】察省许多开明地主纷纷献田。察北七专署专员，中共党员柴书林说服乃爷，将张北康保两地祖田三千八百余亩，分配给农民耕种，连同今春捐助灾民土地五百亩共已献田四千二百余亩。张北西大每村一百五十户佃农，平均获得七亩多地。柴专员亲属察北望族宋玉金、宋玉瑞等五位开明士绅，亦发挥此一光荣族风，除留足够之自耕地外，相继献田四千九百余亩。各地农民获得土地时，均热烈集会庆祝，纷纷致函柴专员，对他八年来英勇献身民族解放事业，今又捐献田产帮助农民翻身表示极大谢忱，咸认共产党才真是农民的救星。涿鹿新保安开明地主董德峰，献出良田二百七十八亩，房屋六十八间后，愉快的对朋友说：“地主阶级依靠农民而驱侈逸乐的过活，这是历史上的大不公平。现在靠自己经营来过生活，心境可畅快多了。”政府督学刘盛转，全家六口人留地十五亩自耕，其余一百一十亩租田全部分给贫苦农民耕种。
