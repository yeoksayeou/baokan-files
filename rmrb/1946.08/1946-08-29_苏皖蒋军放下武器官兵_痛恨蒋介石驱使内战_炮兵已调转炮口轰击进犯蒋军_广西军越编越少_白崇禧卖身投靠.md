Xinhua News Agency, August 25th. Comprehensive reports from various places in Jiangsu and Anhui: After the anti-war and strike-breaking officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army came to the liberated areas, their lives and thoughts have made significant progress in a short period of time. Their daily remarks show their consistent hatred for the civil war and dictatorship, and their desire for peace and democracy. The officers and soldiers of the 92nd Brigade and the 172nd Brigade of the Kuomintang army, who went on strike in Yugou and Sixian, lived a free and happy life in some reception centers. During the day, they read newspapers, read books, and chatted about current affairs. In the evening, they sang and entertained collectively. They could eat eggs every day, and eat meat once every two days. They gratefully said: "In the past, when we were soldiers, we couldn't see any meat for half a year." When it came to fighting the civil war, they all said: "We were deceived and forced to come." Xu, the platoon leader of the 188th company of the 276th Regiment, said: "Only those officials are willing to fight the civil war, they can be promoted and make a fortune, and our fate will be poor all our lives. We are unwilling for Chinese people to fight Chinese people." They believed that striking in the battlefield was the best way to oppose the civil war. Guo Yunlong, the squad leader of the fifth squad of the first company of the first battalion of the 276th Regiment, excitedly described how he and the platoon leader put up four machine guns and sixteen rifles and handed them over to the New Fourth Army. He went on to say: "I think the only good way to save the country, the people, and ourselves in the civil war is to lay down our arms." A Kuomintang army officer of the 92nd Division, when he was in Nanjing, heard that he was going to the north to fight the civil war. He wrote two sentences on the wall to express his attitude: "This road will not work, go to Mao Zedong." The officers and soldiers from non-direct line troops were even more indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's unequal treatment of the so-called "miscellaneous brands." Hu Shusheng, the company commander of the fifth company of the second battalion of the 514th Regiment of the Guizhou Army, said: "Our Guangxi army is being reduced more and more, while Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops are being increased more and more. The only one who has a way out in the Guangxi army is Bai Chongxi, who sells himself out, and the rest are only demoted and not promoted. I have been a company commander for five or six years, and I have long been unwilling to do it. When your guns fired, I said to my brothers: 'It is better for us to go to the New Fourth Army, I heard that the New Fourth Army is very good, let's all go there!' All the brothers of the fifth company immediately followed me." Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader Qin Desheng said: "Chiang Kai-shek is determined to eliminate dissidents. Many old men in their fifties and sixties in our Guangxi army are forced to fight the civil war and die." When I arrived at Da Zhouzhuang (near Sixian), I reported to the battalion commander that I was hungry and couldn't walk, and he scolded me for rebelling, pulled out his box cannon and wanted to shoot me. When your guns fired, he slipped away. I said to my brothers, lie down and don't fight. The brothers all agreed, and we came over." Luo Xinxi, the major battalion deputy of the 19th Regiment of the New 7th Brigade of the 21st Division of the Kuomintang Army, who went on strike in the war east of Hai'an, said: "In the 30th year of the Republic of China, I was stationed in Fanchang, southern Anhui, with the 50th Army. At that time, under the order of Chiang Kai-shek and Gu Zhutong, I participated in the encirclement and suppression of the headquarters of the New Fourth Army. I immediately understood their intention to eliminate dissidents. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, many puppet troops joined. The internal factions were complicated, and the central puppet central army was indistinguishable. The country bumpkins from Sichuan and the foreign devils who graduated from the Army University fought endlessly. The latter had just come out of school and held real power, doing whatever they wanted. We natives were not from the direct line, so we were not popular." Colonel Regiment Commander Liu Quanmin said: "I used to be forced to participate in the evil civil war. Today, I can still participate in the democratic front to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship. It is the greatest luck in my life." In addition to some who wanted to go home, the New Fourth Army gave them travel expenses to send them home (on July 28, a certain place in central Jiangsu happily sent 107 Kuomintang soldiers who laid down their arms in the Taixing Rugao battle home). Most of them were willing to stay in the liberated area to participate in democratic construction. Some of them have also taken up weapons again to avenge the reactionaries who have oppressed them for many years. Zhu Yide, a Kuomintang soldier who came over in the Taixing battle last month, captured three rifles and one prisoner in the Chenqiao battle. Yang Guisheng of the machine gun and artillery company hit six out of eight shots when shelling the Kuomintang army's bunkers. Hu Liangyu was injured in the Fenjie battle. The commander personally comforted him and gave him recuperation expenses. He said with emotion: "There has never been such a thing in the Central Army. When the wound is slightly healed, I will ask to go to the front line again."

　　苏皖蒋军放下武器官兵
    痛恨蒋介石驱使内战
    炮兵已调转炮口轰击进犯蒋军
    广西军越编越少
    白崇禧卖身投靠
    【新华社二十五日电】综合苏皖各地报导：蒋军各部反战罢战官兵来到解放区后，不久生活思想都有很显著的进展，从他们日常言论中表现出对内战独裁一致的仇恨和对和平民主的渴望。先后在渔沟泗县两地罢战的蒋军九十二旅与一七二旅官兵，在某些招待所过着自由愉快的生活，白天看报、看书、漫谈时事，晚上集体娱乐拉拉唱唱，每天能吃到鸡蛋，每两天能吃到一次肉。他们感激的说：“过去当士兵半年也看不到一点肉。”说到打内战一致表示：“我们是被骗来的被逼来的。”二七六团一八八连徐排长说：“打内战只有当官的那些小子愿意，他们可以升官发财，而我们一辈子命运是穷光蛋，我们是不愿中国人打中国人的。”他们认为在战场上罢战是反对内战最好的办法。二七六团一营一连五班上的班长郭云龙，兴奋地叙述他和排长把四挺机枪和十六枝步枪架起来交给新四军的经过。接着说：“我认为在内战中只有自己放下武器是救国救民救自己的好办法。”九十二师一个军官在南京时，听说要到北方打内战，他在墙上题了两句话来表示态度：“此路行不通，去奔毛泽东。”来自非嫡系部队官兵，更愤慨蒋介石对所谓“杂牌”的不平等待遇。桂军一七二旅五一四团二营五连连长胡树生说：“我们广西军越编越少，蒋介石嫡系部队则越编越多。广西军队里有出路的只有卖身投靠的白崇禧一个，其余的只有降级没有升级。我干了五六年还是个连长，我早就不愿干了，当着你们的枪一响，我就向兄弟们说：‘内战打死我们，不如我们都过新四军那边，听说新四军那边很好，我们都过去吧！’一呼百应五连兄弟马上跟着过来了。”少尉排长秦德胜说：“蒋介石一心想消灭异己，我们广西军里很多五六十岁的老头子逼着他们打内战送死。”我走到大周庄（按在泗县附近）就报告营长说：“我肚子饿了走不动，他骂我想造反，掏出盒子枪要枪毙我。等到你们枪一响他就溜之大吉，我对弟兄们说卧倒不打了，弟兄们都同意，我们就过来了。”在海安以东战争中，罢战的蒋军二十一师新七旅十九团少校营副罗心喜说：“民国三十年我在五十军驻皖南繁昌，当时在蒋介石顾祝同命令下参加围歼新四军军部。即明了他们居心消灭异己。抗战胜利后，加入许多伪军，内部派系复杂，中央伪中央军不分，四川行伍出身的土包子和陆军大学毕业生的洋鬼子斗争不休。后者刚从学校出来掌握实权，为所欲为，我们土棍子因为不是嫡系就吃不开。”上校团长刘权民说：“过去被迫参加罪恶内战的我，今天还能参加民主阵线反对蒋介石的独裁。是一生中的大幸。”他们除一部分希望回家的由新四军发给路费遣送回家（七月二十八日苏中某地即曾欢送泰兴如皋战役中放下武器之蒋军一部一百零七人回家），另外大多数都愿留在解放区参加民主建设，一部分并已重握武器向多年欺压他们的反动派复仇。上月泰兴战役中过来的蒋军士兵朱一德，在陈桥战斗中一次缴到三枝步枪，捉到一个俘虏；机炮连杨贵生，炮击蒋军碉堡连放八炮命中六炮。胡良玉在分界战斗中挂了彩，指挥员亲自慰问他并发给疗养费，他感动的说：“在中央军里从来没有这样的事，等伤口稍好我要求再上前线。”
