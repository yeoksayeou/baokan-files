Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 18th. Mr. Zhang Yisheng, a major propaganda officer of the 65th Division (formerly renamed from the 65th Army) of the Chiang army, who defected from Jingjiang military sub-district to the liberated area to oppose the civil war last month, recently wrote a letter to all officers and soldiers of the division who are still being forced to serve as cannon fodder in the front line of the Hai'an area, pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek's purpose in transferring the Guangdong army's 65th Division away from Guangdong and into the civil war is nothing more than to eliminate dissidents. He earnestly advises all officers and soldiers of the division: "They should maintain the honor they gained in the War of Resistance with resolute actions, and not let it be stained by the evils of the civil war. They should immediately reject the reactionaries' orders for civil war, and join hands with the people's army, the New Fourth Army, to smash the reactionaries' conspiracy to eliminate dissidents and persist in dictatorial civil war, and strive for the realization of national peace and democracy."
    
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. Captain Liu Shanben, Captain Zhang Shouyi, and others, recently sent a telegram congratulating General Hao Pengju on his righteous actions against the civil war, saying: "When the General led the entire army to revolt on the Taierzhuang front line and stood on the side of the people, the good news spread, and the whole country cheered. We hereby send a telegram to express our congratulations, and we are willing to work together to fight to the end for China's independence, peace, and democracy!"
