The Taihang People's Armed Forces are Unprecedentedly Strong
	Yang Diankui

In the counter-offensive and the subsequent vigorous mass movement, the militia in our region has experienced an unprecedented and rapid development in the past year. Currently, the total number of militia in the region has reached 200,000, with new developments accounting for 72 percent of the number at the start of the counter-offensive. If we add the self-defense forces, the total number of people's armed forces in the region has reached one million. The fastest development has been in northern Henan, exceeding more than four times the number during the counter-offensive. This development is mainly in the newly liberated areas.

The number of militia weapons has also increased significantly, with the number of rifles and horses increasing by 163 percent compared to the time of the counter-offensive. The sources include those captured during the counter-offensive and self-defense operations, and the remainder are weapons confiscated from reactionary landlords, despots, bandits, and secret agents during the mass movement, or purchased with the fruits of the struggle. Explosive weapons, homemade guns, and cannons are also being developed in the newly liberated areas. To defend the fruits of their liberation, the masses are taking up various weapons to arm themselves. For example, in northern Henan, where "steel gun-ism" has always prevailed, some liberated farmers have also taken up homemade guns and cannons that have been buried for many years.

The development of the militia can generally be divided into the following three situations:

The first type is the transformation and expansion of underground armies: Before the counter-offensive, Xingtai, Shahe, Zuoquan, Xiyang, Lucheng, Changzhi, Cixian and other places had underground army organizations. Under the bloody rule of enemy and puppet secret agents, they persisted in underground struggles for a long time and created countless moving deeds. For example, the underground army in Cixian once forced an enemy driver to destroy a locomotive in broad daylight, and once captured and killed more than 30 traitors and secret agents in one month. The underground army in Lucheng independently recovered the Japanese stronghold of Wulihou during the counter-offensive. Enemy and puppet secret agents spared no effort in terrorizing and destroying them due to their fear and hatred. In Cixian, more than 110 people were once captured by the enemy, and only 20 or 30 survived. When the counter-offensive arrived, these underground armies, in coordination with our army and the militia in the old areas, cooperated internally and externally. After recovering large areas of territory, they immediately and automatically transformed into open militia, established an anti-Japanese order, and launched anti-traitor liquidation struggles. They have made great achievements for the nation and the people. Because they were organized during the anti-Japanese struggle and have long been in a state of secrecy and dispersion, they lack education and their class consciousness is not high. There are also some hooligan elements. After being tortured by long-term underground struggles, they inevitably consider themselves meritorious, acting arbitrarily, and despise other cadres and work, such as competing for leadership in the rent reduction and interest reduction struggle. However, after the commendation and grievance campaigns awakened their class consciousness, most of them actively participated in the liberation movement. Many of them became activists, and the movement also absorbed new activists to participate and expand the organization. Only a few degenerates who were bought and used by landlords and secret agents were eliminated in the movement.

The second type is the masses in the newly liberated areas, inspired by the counter-offensive situation and the demands of participating in the war, organized from top to bottom after simple anti-Japanese mobilization work. They temporarily assumed the task of assisting the army and maintaining order in the village. However, because the masses have not been seriously mobilized, there are many speculators, and many are hired by the village with money, with complex components. A considerable number are local ruffians, hooligans, and soldiers of fortune, especially the leadership components, which are mostly controlled by landlords and despots, and some are even transferred from puppet self-government cadres. These elements doubt our militia policy, and are seriously afraid of change, afraid of participating in the war, and afraid of being incorporated into the army. These militia, except for those completely controlled by landlords and secret agents, were resolutely disarmed by the masses. Generally, they were transformed through the test and review of the mass movement struggle, absorbing new activists and changing the leadership components. In some places, they were first subjected to political rectification of the militia, and then transformed through mass struggle.

The third type is completely newly established from the mass movement.

Regardless of the situation, their common feature is that they have been developed and strengthened through close integration with the mass movement and the masses, constituting the main component of the peasant liberation movement. Arming the masses is an important link in the mass movement, especially in the northern Henan area and the border areas, where the armed rule of landlords, despots, secret agents, stubborn puppets, and bandits in one, black guns and assassinations, and armed attacks seriously threaten the masses.

This process of arming the masses can also be divided into: 1. First, there are armed activists: Before there are peasant association militia organizations, several activists secretly take up weapons, or with the support of foreign militia and troops, seize the landlord's armed forces, and then collude with the masses to brew struggles. 2. Gradually form armed peasant associations: Because there are armed forces, the masses dare to follow, the peasant association is organized, and the number of people carrying guns increases. Almost all cadres and activists have guns, forming a situation where the peasant association carries guns. 3. Finally, it develops into the armed forces of the peasant association: When there is a peasant association in the village, the movement is increasingly carried out, and more and more people carry guns. Gradually, from the armed liberation group, armed members, and home self-defense team of the peasant association, a formal militia is formed, which is still under the direct control and leadership of the peasant association. They are responsible for suppressing black gun assassinations, armed attacks and riots, correcting the activities of illegal landlords, despots and secret agents, protecting cadres, activists, protecting the peasant association, and protecting the liberation struggle and liberation interests.

The militia in the old areas supported the struggles in the border areas and directly supported the liberation movement in the new areas. In this period of mass movement alone, Bo'ai has repelled more than 40 attacks by armed secret agents and bandits, and captured 66 bandits, secret agents and traitors alive.

In the Shanxi area, the threat of black gun assassinations is not as serious as in northern Henan, but due to the result of the masses going through eight years of armed rule by enemies, puppets, stubborn elements, and secret agents, coupled with the constant attacks by Yan and puppets in the border areas, and the influence of the militia in the old areas, the masses also generally demanded armed forces and organized militia during the movement. However, it generally developed in large numbers after the establishment of peasant associations and the rent reduction and interest reduction movement. In short, the new feature is that the organization is generally combined with the peasant association, directly under the control and leadership of the peasant association, serving the interests of peasant liberation, completely correcting the past purely armed viewpoint that was separated from the mass movement and the premature emphasis on the independent establishment of the militia.

In the future, the main tasks of the militia work in the new areas are to absorb more peasant association members to participate under the call of combining the deepening of the mass movement and the preparation for self-defense war and protecting the interests of liberation, to use the most loyal and reliable pure peasant backbone as militia cadres, and to conduct general review and education in the militia, to carry out anti-traitor struggles, to continue to rectify the organization, to eliminate the traitors and secret agents who have infiltrated, to improve their class consciousness and armed consciousness, to draw a clear line between the old and new armed forces, so that they will not degenerate, not be usurped, and become more consolidated.

　　太行人民武装空前强大
    杨殿魁
    在反攻和以后轰轰烈烈的群运中，一年来我区民兵，有空前猛烈的发展。现全区民兵已达二十万，新发展数为反攻开始的百分之七十二。如加上自卫队，则全区人民武装已达百万。发展最快的为豫北，超过反攻时的四倍多。这个发展主要在新区。
    民兵的武器增加也很多，步马枪增加数为反攻时的百分之一百六十三。其来源除在反攻与自卫作战中缴获者外，余均为群运中解除之反动地主、恶霸、土匪、特务的武器，或用斗争果实购买的。新区的爆炸武器和土枪、土炮，也正在发展，群众为保卫翻身果实，拿起各种武器来武装自己。如一向盛行“钢枪主义”的豫北，翻身的农民有的也拿起了多年埋藏的土枪、土炮。
    民兵的发展，一般可以分为下述三种情况：
    第一种是地下军转化扩大的：反攻之前，邢台、沙河、左权、昔阳、潞城、长治、磁县等地均有地下军之组织，他们在敌伪特务血腥统治下，长期坚持了地下斗争，创造无数可歌可泣的事迹。如磁县地下军，曾于白天强迫敌司机将火车头炸坏，曾在一个月中捕杀过汉奸特务三十余人。潞城地下军，曾于反攻时，单独收复了五里堠日军据点。敌伪特务对他们的恐怖仇恨，摧残也不遗余力。磁县曾有一次被敌捕去一百一十多人，只有二、三十人生还。这些地下军反攻到来，配合我军与老区民兵，里应外合，收复大块国土后，立即自动转化为公开民兵，建立起抗日秩序，展开反奸清算斗争。他们于民族于人民有其丰功伟绩。由于是抗日斗争中组织起来的，长期处于秘密分散的状态，缺乏教育工作，阶级觉悟不高，还有一些流氓成份，经长期地下斗争的折磨，一旦解放，不免自居有功，独断独行，轻视其他干部与工作，如在减租减息斗争中争领导权等现象。但经过表功和诉苦运动，唤醒其阶级自觉后，他们大部便积极参加了翻身运动。许多并成为积极分子，运动中又吸取了新的积极分子参加，组织扩大。只有个别被地主特务收买利用的蜕化分子，在运动中被淘汰了。
    第二种是新解放区群众在反攻形势鼓舞与参战任务要求之下，经过简单的抗日发动工作，自上而下组织起来的。临时担负协助军队与维持村内秩序。但因群众尚未认真发动，投机者多，不少是村中出钱雇的，成份复杂，相当大的数量为地痞、流氓、兵油子，特别是领导成份，大部为地主恶霸所掌握，有的甚至是伪自卫国干部转任的。这些分子，怀疑我民兵政策，严重的怕变天、怕参战、怕编兵。这些民兵在群运中，除完全为地主特务掌握者，经过群众坚决解除其武装外，一般是经过群运斗争的考验审查加以改造，吸收新的积极分子，改换领导成份。有的地方则是先经过民兵的政治整训，再经过群众斗争改造的。
    第三种是完全从群运中新建立的。
    不论那种情况，其共同的特点，都是经过群运与群众紧密结合发展壮大起来的，构成农民翻身运动的主要组成部分，武装群众为群运的重要环节，特别是豫北地区与边沿地区，在地主、恶霸、特务、顽伪、土匪数位一体的武装统治之下，黑枪暗杀，武装袭击，严重的威胁着群众。
    这种武装群众的过程也可分为：一、首先有武装的积极分子：在没有农会民兵组织以前，先由几个积极分子秘密拿起武器，或在外来民兵、军队支援下，夺取地主武装，再串通群众酝酿斗争。二、逐渐形成武装的农会：由于有了武装，群众敢跟着走，农会组织起来了，背枪的人增多，差不多干部、积极分子都枪不离身，形成农会带枪的局面。三、最后发展为农会的武装：村中有了农会，运动日益开展，带枪的也越来越多，逐渐由农会的武装翻身组、武装会员、保家自卫队等名称，组成正式的民兵，仍在农会的直接掌握领导下，担负镇压黑枪暗杀，武装袭击暴动，纠察非法地主恶霸特务的活动，保卫干部，积极分子，保卫农会，保卫翻身斗争与翻身利益。
    老区民兵，支援边地斗争，直接支援新区的翻身运动。仅博爱在这一段群运中，便打退武装特务土匪的袭击在四十多次以上，活捉土匪特务汉奸达六十六名。
    在山西地区，黑枪暗杀威胁虽不如豫北严重，但由于群众经过八年敌、伪、顽、特武装统治的结果，加上阎、伪在边地的不断袭击，及老区的民兵影响，群众在运动中，也普遍要求武装，组织民兵。不过一般是在有了农会与减租减息运动中才大量发展的。总之，新的特点，是在组织上普遍与农会结合在一起，直接由农会掌握领导，为农民翻身利益而服务，完全纠正了过去离开群运的单纯武装观点与过早的强调民兵单独成立的。
    今后新区民兵工作的主要任务，在结合群运的深入与自卫战准备、保卫翻身利益的号召下，更大批的吸收农会会员参加，以最忠实可靠的纯洁农民骨干当民兵干部，并在民兵中普遍进行审查和教育，开展反奸斗争，继续整顿组织，为清除混入的奸特分子，提高其阶级自觉与武装自觉，划清新旧武装界限，使其不致蜕化，不致被篡夺，更加巩固起来。
