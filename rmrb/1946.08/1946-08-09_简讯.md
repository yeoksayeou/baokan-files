Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 5th. Mr. Geng Yide, a private representative of the British Consul-General in Qingdao, came to Yantai on the 26th of last month to inspect British properties in Yantai and discuss trade issues. Cao Manzhi, Director of the Jiaodong Liberated Area Administrative Office, received him. Mr. Geng first thanked the Liberated Area government on behalf of the Consul-General for its comprehensive protection of the British Consulate and its properties in Yantai, noting the stark contrast to the heavy losses incurred during the takeover in Hankou, Jiujiang, Hong Kong, and other areas under Kuomintang rule. Subsequently, Director Cao elaborated on the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies, welcoming Allied nationals to do business in the Liberated Area, where they would have full freedom and the right to government protection, under the premise of respecting Chinese sovereignty and laws.
