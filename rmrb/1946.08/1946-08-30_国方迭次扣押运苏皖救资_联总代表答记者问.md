Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 25th. Our reporter visited Mr. Rivington, the UNRRA representative, at the Bianfu (Border Government) Foreign Affairs Office on the evening of the 11th of this month. Mr. Rivington was chatting and relaxing with Mr. Roderick, UNRRA Special Inspector, and Mr. Li Jiaobin, representative of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration. Mr. Rivington spoke fluent Mandarin. The reporter's questions and Mr. Rivington's answers are as follows:
    Question: "UNRRA's relief work is often disrupted. What measures will UNRRA take?" Answer: "Three methods: (1) Make a sign for transportation to the Liberated Areas and (unclear code). (2) Report the bombing and strafing incidents to the Peiping Military Mediation Department, the National Government, and President Truman, requesting effective prevention. (3) If the above two methods are ineffective, and UNRRA is unable to work in the Communist areas as a result, then UNRRA's relief work in the Nationalist areas should also be temporarily withdrawn."
    Question: "The Nationalist Party detained the second batch of UNRRA relief supplies destined for the Liberated Areas in Yangzhou. What attitude has UNRRA expressed, and what remedial measures have been taken?" Answer: "UNRRA has reported this to Washington. However, the supplies detained in Yangzhou this time are not counted as part of the supplies due to the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Government. There are still more than 1,000 tons of supplies in Zhenjiang, ready to be transported to the Liberated Areas, but transportation is difficult and cannot be done quickly. This time I entered the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Areas, I also brought 350 tons."
    Question: "Who are the people to whom the Nationalist authorities are distributing the relief supplies, does the gentleman know?" Answer: "I have seen those political refugees receiving the supplies (reporter's note: i.e., the 'North Jiangsu refugees' propagandized by the Nationalists). They were well-dressed when they received the relief supplies, hired rickshaws to send people to receive them. They are not the people UNRRA wants to help. Gu Zhenggang even privately took 1,000 tons of supplies and gave them to these political refugees without going through anyone. We oppose this behavior, which violates the basic principles of the agreement between the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the National Government. This matter has been reported to Washington to oppose Gu Zhenggang's use of UN relief supplies as a weapon for political struggle. Because Mr. Gu's approach violates the principles of UNRRA's distribution of relief supplies."

　　国方迭次扣押运苏皖救资
    联总代表答记者问
    【新华社淮阴二十五日电】本社记者于本月十一日晚赴边府交际处访问联总代表瑞维廉氏，适瑞氏正与联总特派视察员罗德华、行总代表李绞缤诸氏纳凉漫谈，瑞氏操普通华语颇为流利，记者所提问题经瑞氏一一答复如下：问“联总救济工作常遭破坏，联总将有何措施？”答：“三个办法：（１）作一标志，向解放区运输及（电码不明）（２）将飞机轰炸扫射事件，告北平军调部、国民政府及杜鲁门总统请予有效制止。（３）如采用上列两种办法均无效果，联总将因此而不能在共产党区进行工作，则联总在国民党区救济工作亦应暂时撤回”。问：“国民党在扬州扣押联总运来解放区之第二批救济物资，联总曾表示过何种态度，采取何种补救办法？”答：“联总已报告华盛顿去了。不过此次扬州被扣押物资已不计算在应给苏皖边府物资之内，镇江现尚有一千余吨物资，准备运来解放区，因交通困难不能迅速运此，此次我进入苏皖解放区，亦带来三百五十吨。”问：“国民党当局将救济物资发给那些人，先生知道否？”答：“我曾看到那些领取物资的政治难民（记者按：即国民党宣传之“苏北难民”），他们领取救济物资的时候穿得很好，坐着黄包车派人来领取，他们不是联总所要救济的对象，而谷正纲居然私自拿去一千吨物资放给这些政治难民，没有通过任何人。我们反对这种违反联合国救济总署与国民政府协议的基本原则的行为。此事已经告给华盛顿，反对谷正纲用联合国救济物资来作政治斗争的武器。因为谷氏那种做法，是违反联总分配救济物资的原则”。
