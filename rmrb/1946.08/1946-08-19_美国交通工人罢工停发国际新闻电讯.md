　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: New York dispatch: Two thousand workers from the Transportation Workers Union of the Congress of Industrial Organizations halted the sending of international news telegrams on the evening of the 12th. American newspapers and news agencies have only a weak connection with the outside world, with only the transatlantic radiotelephone available as a substitute. The transportation workers' strike turned into a strike by three hundred employees of intelligence paper radio on the 13th. This strike by three hundred employees is in opposition to the unfair dismissal of workers. It is reported that Washington officials are very concerned about the transportation workers' strike because they are eager to obtain full information during the current peace conference and the Palestine crisis.

　　美国交通工人罢工停发国际新闻电讯
    【新华社延安十五日电】纽约讯：美产业工会联合会交通工会工人二千名，十二日晚停发国际新闻电讯，美国报纸与新闻社与外部世界只能维持薄弱之关系，仅有大西洋无线电话可代用。交通工人罢工至十三日，已变为同情报纸无线电职工三百名之罢工。而此三百职工之罢工则为反对不公平开除工人。据悉华府官方因目前正值和会及巴勒斯坦危机过程中，切盼能获得充分消息，故对交通工人之罢工甚为关切。
