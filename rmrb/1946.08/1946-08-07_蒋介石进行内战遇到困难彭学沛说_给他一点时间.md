Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. While Jiang Jieshi was sitting in Guling directing the nationwide civil war, his Minister of Propaganda, Peng Xuepei, made a brief statement at a press banquet in Guling on the 2nd, asking the Chinese people to "give him (referring to Jiang Jieshi) a little time." (Central News Agency, 2nd). The reporter commented that Peng Xuepei's statement indicated that Jiang Jieshi had encountered insurmountable difficulties in conducting a large-scale civil war, and was unable to realize his dream of "victory." Jiang Jieshi had expected to eliminate the Central Plains troops of the Chinese Communist Party in a short period of time and achieve a "stunning victory." However, what was stunning was not only the breakthrough of Jiang's encirclement and annihilation troops, but also the fact that in just over a month, Jiang's army had lost more than 70,000 people and a lot of American weapons, which is also a stunning figure. Under these circumstances, Peng Xuepei could not help but shout, "No one is more anxious than the government, no one is more anxious than Chairman Jiang." However, since Jiang Jieshi and his followers are so "anxious," do they have any remorse? Peng Xuepei's remarks gave a negative answer: "But it always takes a little time," "Chinese affairs have to be slower due to conditional relations." The "little time" Jiang Jieshi needs is not for peace negotiations, but for a military solution, that is to say: "It won't work to fight quickly, let me have more time to fight slowly!" The Chinese people will undoubtedly give the most accurate answer to such a request from the Jiang Jieshi ruling clique: The Chinese people have given you too much time! Your perverse acts over the past nineteen years have only increased, and your dark rule far exceeds that of Empress Dowager Cixi and Yuan Shikai, unprecedented in Chinese history. The truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have given you opportunities to repent and reform, but you have torn them up. The Chinese people have given you too much time, and today, whether you fight quickly or slowly, the Chinese people will absolutely not allow it! You should immediately pull back from the brink! At the very least, immediately stop the attacks on the Liberated Areas and the terrorist assassinations of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

　　蒋介石进行内战遇到困难彭学沛说“给他一点时间”
    【新华社延安四日电】正当蒋介石坐在牯岭指挥全国内战的时候，他的宣传部长彭学沛于二日在牯岭记者公宴会中发表简短谈话，要中国人民“给他（指蒋介石）一点时间”。（中央社二日电）记者评称：彭学沛这一谈话，系蒋介石在进行大规模内战中已遇到了不可克服的困难，无法实现他“胜利”的梦想，蒋介石预期在短期间消灭中共中原部队，获得“惊人胜利”。然而，惊人的不仅是对蒋的围歼部队的突围，在短短一个多月的时间中，蒋家军已经损失七万多人和许多美国武器，这也是一个惊人的数字。在这种情况下，彭学沛就不能不喊出“没有人比政府还急，没有人比蒋主席还急”。但是，蒋介石及其随从者既然这样“着急”，他们是不是有悔祸之心呢？彭学沛的谈话给了否定的答复：“但是总需要一点时间”，“中国事情因条件关系事情得要慢一点”。蒋介石所需要的“一点时间”不是为了和平谈判，而是为了武力解决，就是说：“快快打不行，让你再给我时间慢慢打下去吧！”中国人民对于蒋介石统治集团这样的要求，也无疑的要给予最确的答复：中国人民给你们的时间已太多了！十九年来你们的倒行逆施，有增无已，你们的黑暗统治，远过西太后、袁世凯，为中国历史上所未有。停战协定和政协决议都给了你们以悔过迁善的机会，但是你们又偏偏把它撕毁。中国人民给你们的时间已经太多了，今天不管你快快打也好，慢慢打也好，中国人民都绝对不能容许！你们应当立即悬崖勒马！最低限度，立即停止对解放区的进攻和对国民党统治区人民的恐怖暗杀。
