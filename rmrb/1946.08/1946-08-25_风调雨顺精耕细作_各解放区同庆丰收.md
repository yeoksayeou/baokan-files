    Favorable Weather and Careful Farming, All Liberated Areas Celebrate a Bumper Harvest
        Taiyue Area
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, reports] This year, the Taiyue area has enjoyed favorable weather, promising a bumper harvest for both seasons. The entire area has over ten million mu of cultivated land, with wheat fields accounting for five million mu. The summer wheat harvest totaled 390 million jin, exceeding the average summer wheat harvest by 50%, the largest harvest in ten years. The summer rains were particularly well-distributed, and the eight million mu of autumn crops are growing very lushly, with full ears of grain extending a foot long. According to experienced old farmers, the average autumn harvest is expected to be 140 jin of millet per mu, for a total of 1.12 billion jin of autumn grain across the area. If the total yield of the summer and autumn seasons is combined, this year each person can harvest 503 jin of fine grains, greatly improving the lives of the peasants. Two million mu of wheat fields have already been plowed. As the saying goes, "Rain in June is good for planting wheat," and a good wheat harvest next year is also expected.
        Taihang Area
    [Our newspaper, Changzhi, reports] The Shangdang Basin stretches for hundreds of miles, and the autumn crops are very lush. The "Golden Queen" corn plants are over ten feet tall, each with two ears. The kernels on the ears of grain are extremely full. People on the road are saying, "Good crops, good crops." It is said that "this year could be a ten-out-of-ten year, with each mu of land yielding two shi." Also, new autumn produce has already hit the market in Changzhi, with green corn costing three or four yuan per ear and yams costing five yuan per jin. In the vegetable market, eggplants, cabbage, and radishes are piled high like mountains. A vegetable seller from Zifang Village in the west of the city told the reporter that this year there has been ample rainfall, and there are many vegetables. Those who grow vegetables are making money, and it is convenient for those who eat them. This year, the area planted with special crops in Changzhi has greatly increased compared to last year. More than 1,000 mu of indigo were planted this year, a fifteen-fold increase over last year. 6,500 mu of tobacco were planted, a doubling compared to last year. Hemp, a famous product of Shangdang, was planted on more than 7,000 mu last year, and this year a total of more than 23,000 mu were planted. The new hemp plants are over ten feet tall and have already been cut down. It is estimated that each mu can yield 70-80 jin of hemp, and planting one mu of hemp is equivalent to seven or eight mu of autumn crops.
            Luzhong Area
    [Xinhua News Agency, LinYi, 22nd] The autumn crops in the Luzhong Liberated Area are growing strongly, and the prospect of a bumper harvest is unlike anything seen in the past decade. On the Tai'an Laiwu Plain, a famous wheat-producing area, the ears of grain are up to a foot long and reach five or six feet high. Corn and sorghum are also plump and lovely. It is estimated that each mu (960 square steps per large mu) can yield 2,000 jin of millet, and corn and sorghum can produce 1,000 jin. In Li Guizhang Village in Laiwu, a labor hero known for pottery, the average autumn harvest yield for the entire village is 750 jin of grain per person, enough to eat for two years. In the Yi Mountain area, each mu (720 square steps per large mu) can yield 900 jin of millet, and each cotton plant has more than 70 bolls, all of which are plump and solid. Currently, the masses throughout the area are formulating autumn harvest plans, and women will also join in the autumn harvest upsurge.
            Jin-Cha-Ji Area
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 22nd] The summer harvest in the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area was quite abundant, with the total area planted with wheat expanding to more than 12 million mu. With an average yield of seven dou of wheat per mu, the total wheat production is more than 8.4 million shi. In the famous "wheat warehouse" of Hebei, the Central Hebei Plain, 8.95 million mu of wheat were sown, accounting for more than 30% of its total cultivated area. In most areas, the wheat is growing very well, with heavy ears of wheat reaching waist-high. According to statistics from Leting, Fengrun, Yutian, Ninghe, and Baodi counties in Eastern Hebei, there are more than 1.12 million mu of wheat fields, with some areas yielding more than one shi per mu, and usually six or seven dou or more. In the four special districts of Western Hebei, including Yi County, Xushui, Mancheng, and Laishui, more than one million mu of wheat were planted. In Xushui County alone, more than 300,000 mu were planted. In the three special districts of Zhengding, wheat fields accounted for about 26% of the total cultivated land, with an average yield of more than eight dou per mu.
            Suimeng Area
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jining, 15th] A good autumn harvest is expected in the newly liberated Suimeng area this year. The wheat, millet, and grain in various places, as well as the wheat in the plains, are more robust than in previous years. The "small sun and moon" crops, hastily planted after the rain, are also growing rapidly. In the Dafangdian Village area of the fifth district of Jining, the seedlings are already waist-high, unseen in recent years. According to old farmers, the main reason for this year's bumper harvest is that, under the leadership of the democratic government, the planting of opium poppies has been banned, and a large amount of labor that used to be devoted to opium poppy cultivation has been invested in cultivating millet and wheat fields. Secondly, the expansion of water conservancy projects has greatly reduced flooding compared to previous years, allowing the masses to focus on production. Furthermore, government agencies and troops in various places have conscientiously implemented the Suimeng government's decision to stop mobilizing manpower and animal power. After the labor exchange, the number of weeding times has generally increased, and most of the millet, grain, and wheat have been weeded two to three times. Currently, in Jining, Taoji, and other places, the wheat ears are two inches long and very full, and harvesting will begin soon. In the Hezhi Liangcheng plain area, harvesting has already begun. In previous years, laborers from inside the pass (northwestern Shanxi) came to this area to find work or do short-term jobs. This year, because the people in the liberated areas inside the pass have gained large amounts of land, and the Kuomintang areas are obstructing them, there will be a shortage of labor during the autumn harvest here. The democratic government is studying ways to organize labor exchange and mutual assistance.

　　风调雨顺精耕细作  各解放区同庆丰收
          太岳区
    【本报阳城讯】太岳今年风调雨顺，可望两季丰收，全区共耕地一千余万亩，麦田即占五百万亩，夏季共收获小麦三万万九千万斤，超过往年夏麦收获量百分之五十，为十年来所未有之丰收。夏季特别雨水调匀，八百万亩秋禾非常茂盛，谷穗盈尺。据有经验老农说：秋季每亩平均可收获小米一百四十斤，全区共可产秋粮十一万万二千万斤。若以夏秋两季总产量合计，今年每人可收获细粮五百零三斤，农民生活因之将大加改善。现有麦田二百万亩已经耕过。语云“六月有雨好种麦”，明年麦收有望亦可预期。
        太行区
    【本报长治讯】上党盆地纵横数百里，秋禾甚为繁茂。金皇后玉茭身高丈许，均秀两穗。谷穗颗粒极为饱满。路上行人都说“好庄稼，好庄稼”。据称：“今年可有十分年景，每亩地平常可收两石。”又长治街上新秋已上市，青玉茭三、四元钱一穗，山药蛋五元一斤。菜市上茄子、白菜、萝卜堆积如山，城西紫坊村一个卖菜的向记者说：今年雨水不缺，菜蔬很多，种菜的发财，吃菜的方便。今年长治特种作物较去年大为增加，蓝今年种一千多亩，比去年增十五倍，烟叶种六千五百亩，比去年增加一倍。上党名产之麻，去年种七千多亩，今年共种二万三千多亩。新麻身高丈余，均已割倒，据估计每亩可下麻七八十斤，种一亩麻可顶七、八亩秋。
            鲁中区
    【新华社临沂二十二日电】鲁中解放区秋禾苗壮，丰收之象为近十年所未有，著名小麦产区泰安莱芜平原上，谷穗长可盈尺，高及五六尺。玉蜀黍与高粱均肥硕可爱。预计谷子每亩（九百六十方步大亩）可收二千斤，玉蜀黍及高粱可产一千斤，莱芜陶磁劳动英雄李贵章村，全村今年秋收产量平均每人可得粮七百五十斤，足够二年食用。沂山区谷子每亩（七百二十方步大亩）可收九百斤，棉花每株结桃七十余，且均丰满结实。现全区群众正纷纷拟订秋收计划，妇女亦将投入秋收热潮。
            晋察冀
    【新华社张家口二十二日电】晋察冀解放区今年夏收尚称丰盈，计小麦种植总面积扩大至一千二百余万亩，平均每亩以产麦七斗计，共产麦八百四十余万石。河北著名的“小麦仓库”冀中平原，播种小麦即达八百九十五万余亩，约占其总耕地面积百分之三十以上。大部地区麦子成长极佳，沉重的麦穗高达腰际。冀东据乐亭、丰润、玉田、宁河、宝坻县统计，麦田即达一百一十二万二千余亩，每亩产量有逾一石者，通常亦在六、七斗以上，冀西四专区易县、徐水、满城、涞水等十县，种麦一百余万亩，徐水一县即达三十余万亩，三专区正定麦田达总耕地百分之二十六左右，每亩平均产量为八斗余。
            绥蒙区
    【新华社集宁十五日电】今年绥蒙新解放区秋收有望，各地麦、粟、谷及平川地区麦子均较往年茁壮，雨后抢种之小日月庄稼，亦迅速生长。集＠①五区大房店村一带禾苗高及半人，为数年来所未有。据老农说：今年所以丰收，主要是在民主政府领导下禁种洋烟（鸦片），以过去经营洋烟的大量劳动力投入耕种粟麦地。其次为水利事业增加，水患较往年大减，群众能安心生产，以及各地机关部队均切实执行绥蒙政府停止动员人力畜力的决定。变工后，锄地次数普遍增加，粟谷及麦子大部锄过两次至三次。现在集宁陶集等地，麦穗长二寸许，十分饱满，不日即可收割，和枝凉城平川地区，已开始收割。往年口内（晋西北）区劳动力多来此地揽工或打短工，今年因为口内解放区人民大量获得土地，而国民党地区又受当局阻拦，故此间秋收将感劳力缺乏。民主政府正研究组织劳力变工互助。
