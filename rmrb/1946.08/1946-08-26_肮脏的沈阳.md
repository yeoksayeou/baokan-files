　　Dirty Shenyang
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Chongqing News: The "New Generation" weekly here published a correspondence titled "Dirty Shenyang," stating: Shenyang at night is a scene of deathly silence, with occasional gunfire and commands that make people's hearts race. Young people aged twelve to twenty-six are all conscripted into the army by Du Yuming. Many villagers have come to the city to escape conscription, and the strange phenomenon of buying "substitutes" has reappeared in the Northeast. The author visited a village where both the Eighth Route Army and the Chiang troops had stayed. He said: "The Eighth Route Army gave the impression to the common people of being polite and orderly. They swept the courtyard when they entered, and addressed the elderly as 'Grandpa' and 'Grandma' when they entered the house. As for the Central Army, when they came, they cut down the villagers' apricot, plum, and peach trees, saying they were obstacles and used them for trenches. They ate chickens and pigs, eating whatever they could find. They asked the women for needles, thread, and scissors. When the women hid, they opened the boxes themselves and took them. When they left, every family was short of something." When he asked the local people if the "Central Army" was good, the people all pursed their lips and said: "What's good about them? I think they are really not as good as the Eighth Route Army. Those barbarians are terrible!" The author also said: "The Chiang troops are busy getting married when they arrive in the Northeast, but Jinzhou was taken from them after they got to Shenyang. This has caused widespread dissatisfaction among the people of the Northeast. Du Yuming has now become the dictator of the Northeast, levying donations and taxes, and even competing to appoint county magistrates. Xu Zhen has appointed a county magistrate, and Du Yuming has also sent a county magistrate there. Two 'parent officials,' one a military officer leading troops, and the other a civil official waiting for orders, are fighting for the county town, but the county town belongs to the military officer. Today, the people of Shenyang are generally saying, 'This is terrible! These barbarians have completely ruined the Northeast! It wasn't even this bad during the time of the little devils!'"

　　肮脏的沈阳
    【新华社延安二十三日电】渝讯：此间《新生代》周刊第十三期上发表题为《肮脏的沈阳》的通讯中称：沈阳夜晚是一片死寂，枪声时作，口令声吓人心跳。十二岁到廿六岁的青年，一律被杜聿明征用入伍了，许多乡下人都到城里来逃役，买入“代役”的怪事，又出现在东北。作者曾到过一个八路军与蒋军都住过的一个乡村，他说：“八路军给老百姓的印象是有礼貌有秩序，进院子扫院子，进屋遇老人称‘大爷’，‘大娘’。中央军呢，来了时把乡下人的杏树、李树、桃树都砍了，说这是障碍，用做壕沟用了；吃鸡吃猪，见啥吃啥；他们向女人要针要线要剪刀，女人躲开了，他们就自己打开箱子拿，走时每家都短了东西。”当他问当地老百姓“中央军”好不好？老百姓都呶着嘴说：“好啥呢，我看真不如八路，那蛮子可坏透了！”作者又说：“蒋军到东北大事结婚忙，可是锦州弄上到沈阳就丢了，这事引起东北老百姓普遍的不满。杜聿明现在成了东北的独裁者，派捐派税，还争着派县长：徐箴派了县长，杜聿明亦派一个县长去了，两个父母官，一个带兵的武官，一个等因奉此的文官，争得县城的还是武官。今天沈阳的老百姓普遍的都说“不得了呵！这一下子蛮子可算把东北弄完了！小鬼子时候也不过这样惨呵！”
