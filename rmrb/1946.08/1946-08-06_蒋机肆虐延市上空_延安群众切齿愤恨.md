Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Yesterday, Yan'an City was bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft. The masses here expressed extreme indignation. Liu Hancheng, a farmer from Heilonggou in the Eastern District, complained to District Chief Wang that Chiang Kai-shek had destroyed his crops. He said: Three sets of bombs fell on his field, destroying more than half a mu of sorghum seedlings that were over four feet tall. Carpenter Liu Jiangong expressed his anger and determination, saying: "Chiang Kai-shek is so unreasonable, we must fight him to the end!" Rope maker Luo Laosheng angrily questioned Chiang Kai-shek: "The people of Yan'an live and work in peace under the leadership of the Communist Party, what crime have they committed?" The people of Yan'an are not afraid of Japanese bombs, and they are even less afraid of the bombs that Chiang Kai-shek gets from the United States, and they warn the reactionaries to immediately stop this crime. When Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft raided the city's skies yesterday, the masses' air defense was orderly and they suffered no losses. District Chief Wang of the Eastern District and Wang Zhiqing, the platoon leader of the militia, both told reporters: "Our mountain valley cannot be frightened by airplanes. Ten bombs were wasted, only a few crops were damaged." Li Jiaowa, a soldier guarding the airport, said: "I personally saw Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft strafe four times, firing many bullets and dropping twelve bombs, all of which missed." He continued: "Chiang Kai-shek wants to scare us with bombing, that's a dream. We want to protest and accuse this unreasonable atrocity to the people of the whole country." Lao Wei, a staff member of this agency and a veteran of the Long March, said: "In the past, during the ten years of civil war, we were not afraid of Chiang Kai-shek's bombing, and during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we were not afraid of Japanese bombing. Are we still afraid of it now?"

　　蒋机肆虐延市上空
    延安群众切齿愤恨
    【新华社延安三日电】昨日延市遭蒋机轰炸，此间群众表示极大愤恨，东区黑龙沟农民刘汉成向王区长控告蒋介石炸坏了他的庄稼，他说：他地里落了三伙炸弹，把四尺多高的谷苗炸了大半亩。木匠刘建功十分气愤而又坚决的表示：“蒋介石这样无理，我们一定要和他拚一下”。麻绳工人罗老胜痛恨的质问蒋介石：“延安老百姓在共产党领导下安居乐业，究竟犯了什么罪”？延安老百姓不怕日本的炸弹，更不怕蒋介石从美国拿来的炸弹，并警告反动派立即停止这种罪行。当昨日蒋机袭入本市上空时，群众防空秩序井然，未受丝毫损失。东区王区长和基干自卫军排长王志清同志都对记者说：“咱们这个山沟沟，飞机也骇唬不了人，费了十颗炸弹，仅炸坏几株庄稼”。我守卫机场的战士李交娃说：“我亲眼看见蒋机扫射共四次，发射了许多发子弹，投弹十二枚，都落空了”。他继说：“蒋介石想用轰炸来吓我们，那是做梦，我们要提出抗议，要向全国人民控诉这种无理的暴行”。本社事务人员老魏是长征老战士，他说：“过去在十年内战中，我们并不怕蒋机轰炸，在八年抗战中也不怕日机轰炸，现在还怕它么这？
