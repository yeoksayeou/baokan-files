　　Financial Market Since Currency Contraction
    Wang Jingran
    Since the Border Region Government ordered all levels of public and private banks to contract currency on July 15th, various branches of the Jinnan Bank have promptly deployed this work in order to quickly stabilize prices and benefit the people's livelihood. This action has been relatively swift. Except for the Jilu豫 (Jilu-Henan-Shandong) and Taiyue regions, which have not yet reported, the Jinnan and Taihang regions alone took action consistently across nine districts within eight days. Apart from Handan, which began deploying the contraction on the same day the Border Region Government issued the order (July 15th), the deployment times in other areas were: Feixiang, Xingtai, and Shexian on the 16th; Gaoyi on the 18th; Changzhi and Zuoquan on the 19th; Linxian on the 20th; Jiaozuo, Nangong, and Weixian on the 21st; and Xiajin, Linqing, and Hengshui on the 23rd (the above locations are where the bank's district branch offices are located). The first emergency measure for currency contraction was to freeze various deposits of all institutions in public and private banks and credit shops. All fixed deposits, current deposits, temporary deposits, and current account deposits that were not immediately needed were temporarily managed by the government and not allowed to be withdrawn. According to statistics from only nine locations, including Handan, Xingtai, Gaoyi, and Jiaozuo, the total was more than 20,000 million yuan, of which deposits in Jinnan Bank accounted for 56.6 percent, deposits in Ruihua Bank accounted for 17.15 percent, and deposits in various credit shops (only Handan and Xingtai included credit shops in the statistics) accounted for 25.25 percent. Regionally, Handan had the largest proportion at 60.63 percent, followed by Xingtai at 26.75 percent, and other locations accounted for 12.62 percent. What does this indicate? It indicates that finance is more concentrated in Handan.
    The second method of currency contraction was to recover matured commercial loans. At that time, Handan, Xingtai, and other places had the following regulations: (1) Focus on recovering current loans first (especially those involving speculation), followed by term loans. (2) Recover from large merchants first, then small merchants (small merchants have a smaller role in the market). (3) Focus on recovering loans that have matured, and酌情 (zhuóqíng - use discretion) recover loans that have not yet matured. (4) For industries, handicrafts, cooperatives, agriculture, water conservancy, and transportation, loans would be recovered and issued simultaneously, while for commerce, loans would only be recovered and not issued. Based on these principles, many business cadres were assigned to urge repayments. The result was a considerable amount of repayments. According to preliminary statistics, the amounts of commercial loans recovered by Jinnan Bank in various places were: Handan recovered 152.75 million yuan within one month, accounting for 88 percent of the actual amount lent as of July 16th (same below); Xingtai recovered 19.8 million yuan within six days, accounting for more than 48 percent of the actual amount lent; Gaoyi recovered 6.8 million yuan within ten days, accounting for more than 97 percent of the actual amount lent; Changzhi recovered 13 million yuan within five days, accounting for 86.67 percent of the actual amount lent; Wu'an recovered 10 million yuan within 23 days, accounting for 83.33 percent of the actual amount lent; Jiaozuo (including counties in the Fourth District) recovered more than 16 million yuan within 14 days, accounting for 64 percent of the actual amount lent; and Weixian recovered 3 million yuan within 15 days, accounting for 75 percent of the actual amount lent. Other places such as Feixiang, Nangong, and Hengshui recovered a total of 3 million yuan, all of which was 100 percent of the amount they had actually lent. On average, within 13 days, for this commercial loan item alone, preliminary and extremely incomplete statistics from ten locations show that more than 122.03 million yuan was recovered, with 70 percent of the places completing more than 80 percent of the recovery task. In Handan alone, for nearly half the days between July 16th and July 31st, more than one million yuan of commercial loans were recovered daily, and during this time, loans were only issued to industry, handicrafts, and transportation, not to commerce. This demonstrates the concrete implementation of the policy of shifting commercial loans to production.
    The third method of currency contraction was to not purchase and store large quantities of goods and to sell goods instead: (1) Major commercial firms and institutions producing goods sold off large quantities of goods, such as grain, salt, cotton, homespun cloth, and foreign cloth. This was carried out simultaneously in Handan, Xingtai, Wu'an, and other places, forcing prices down. (2) Public and private commercial firms stopped or reduced the purchase of goods. With major needs already resolved, public procurement tasks no longer involved large purchases, and private commercial firms also temporarily maintained the status quo due to their capacity being full and insufficient capital turnover. Furthermore, due to natural conditions (clear skies and abundant harvests) and news of military victories, the general supply of goods increased, further discouraging those who wanted to buy goods from acting. (3) In the past, merchants bought goods because of the severe imbalances in various regions, and they transported them back and forth. However, this time the contraction was a consistent effort. It was impossible to borrow money from banks, regardless of the location. Even if some money was available, they did not dare to act aggressively because the difference was not significant. In Handan, for example, funds were not only quite abundant in the past, but the scope of activities was also unusually broad. If goods bought from elsewhere could not be sold temporarily (they would not sell if the price was low), they could borrow from banks and credit shops. If they could not borrow from one bank, they could borrow from another. But now this is no longer possible. If the goods they bought could not be sold, they could not continue their activities. If they could not borrow from one bank, they would face the same situation at another. Therefore, for speculative merchants, this was undoubtedly a head-on blow.
    Currency contraction has been in effect for a month now. In this month, significant progress has been made in stabilizing market prices in various parts of the border region. The prices of general goods have fallen sharply, and people's hearts have gradually settled down, saying that the government is truly working for the masses and truly has the power to do so. In the Taihang region, for example, comparing July 23rd with August 8th in Gaoyi, wheat fell from 1,200 yuan per斗 (dǒu - a unit of dry volume, about 10 liters) to 800-900 yuan, and cotton fell from 450 yuan per斤 (jīn - a unit of weight, about 500 grams) to 260 yuan. In Xingtai, comparing July 16th with July 20th, millet fell from 1,500 yuan per斗 to 1,230 yuan, wheat fell from 1,700 yuan per斗 to 1,500 yuan, and Sunshine brand cloth fell from 34,000 yuan per匹 (pǐ - a unit of length, about 5 meters) to 28,500 yuan. In Wu'an, comparing August 6th with August 7th, wheat fell from 31 yuan per斤 to 28 yuan, millet fell from 30 yuan per斤 to 26 yuan, salt fell from 100 yuan per斤 to 70 yuan, and homespun cloth fell from 1,000 yuan per斤 to 900 yuan. Similarly, in the Jinnan region, comparing July 16th with August 7th in Weixian, cotton fell from 500 yuan per斤 to 400 yuan, wheat fell from 1,000 yuan per斗 to 700 yuan, and homespun cloth fell from 150 yuan per double市尺 (shìchǐ - a unit of length, about 33.3 cm) to 100 yuan. Comparing July 16th with August 8th in Feixiang, homespun cloth fell from 130 yuan per double市尺 to 90 yuan, cotton fell from 550 yuan per斤 (plus three秤 - chèng, a traditional Chinese balance scale) to 480 yuan, wheat fell from 1,500 yuan per double市斗 to 1,200 yuan, and the degree of decline in millet was similar to that of wheat. Comparing July 20th with August 7th in Nangong, cotton fell from 700 yuan per斤 to 400 yuan, homespun cloth fell from 150 yuan per double市尺 to 110 yuan, millet fell from 70 yuan per斤 to 40 yuan, and wheat fell from 90 yuan per斤 to 70 yuan. Foreign exchange drafts fell from 4,100 yuan per 10,000 yuan to 3,340 yuan, and there were no buyers. Comparing before July 16th with August 6th in Hengshui, wheat fell from 850 yuan per斗 (15斤) to 750 yuan, the price of millet was slightly lower than wheat, but the degree of decline was the same, and salt fell from 72 yuan per斤 to 54 yuan. From the above materials, we can see the following issues: (1) Looking at several locations such as Gaoyi, Nangong, Feixiang, Weixian, and Hengshui, if we take the period around July 16th as the base of 100, then in the twenty days or so until around August 7th-8th, the average index of millet in three locations fell to 75.12, the average index of wheat in five locations fell to 77.37, the average index of homespun cloth in three locations fell to 76.41, and the average index of cotton in four locations fell to 70.55. Comparing these four prices, the downward trend is almost the same. If we had to find differences, the rate of decline in cotton and millet could be considered greater, and wheat and homespun cloth slightly less. (2) The price decreases were quite widespread geographically. There is currently no material to report from the Jilu豫 and Taiyue regions, but in the Jinnan and Taihang regions alone, prices fell uniformly within hundreds of miles from Hengshui and Nangong in the east to Changzhi in the west. This shows the organization in our efforts to stabilize prices. As long as we take appropriate countermeasures in a timely manner, prices will never rise as wildly as in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. (3) The price decreases were consistent for both industrial and agricultural products, but the degree of decrease was gradually decreasing. In the past, agricultural product prices often fell, but industrial product prices did not necessarily fall. Today is different: agricultural product prices fall, and industrial product prices fall as well, and the speed is not too drastic. On the one hand, this can avoid excessively large scissors differences between industrial and agricultural product prices and prevent farmers from suffering losses. On the other hand, it prevents industrial and handicraft workers from suffering losses when they purchase and store certain food and raw materials at high prices. That is to say, the consistent decline and gradual price decrease in industrial and agricultural products not only takes care of the farmers but also the industrial and handicraft workers, which is beneficial to the vast majority of the masses.
    What can be seen from this currency contraction? (1) Public finance dominates urban financial activities. This can be seen from deposits and loans and from the supply and distribution of materials. To properly handle urban financial problems, we must carefully and meticulously handle public finance (i.e., public capital). This is the central key to financial problems and an important factor determining the development of industry and commerce. If not handled well, it will not only affect the development and prosperity of industry and commerce but also the people's lives. (2) The currency contraction work must have a core backbone, but it must not be carried out in isolation. It is difficult for one department to take action first, and it is difficult for a few locations acting alone to achieve the expected goals. In addition to considering mature internal and external conditions, there must also be arduous and detailed organizational work. Internal and external conditions include the situation of military and political struggles and the demands of the masses. Organizational work includes the consistent pace of various departments and regions, as well as rapid and timely communication and contact.

　　收缩通货以来的金融市场
    王静然
    自七月十五日边府令各级公私银行收缩通货以后，各地冀南银行即及时布置这一工作，以求得物价很快稳定下来而利民生。这次的动作是比较迅速的。除冀鲁豫、太岳两区尚没有报告外，单就冀南、太行两区来说，前后不出八天功夫，冀南太行两行署区共九个分区，都一致动作起来。除邯郸于边府下令的当天（十五日）即布置紧缩外，其他各地布置紧缩的时间是：十六日肥乡、邢台、涉县，十八日高邑，十九日长治、左权，二十日林县，二十一日焦作、南宫、威县，二十三日夏津、临清、衡水（以上地点都系银行区分支行所住地）。收缩通货的第一个紧急措施是冻结各机关在公私银行银号的各种存款，凡属一时用不着而存入的定存、活存、暂存、往来存款等，统统由政府暂管不许提取。只根据邯郸、邢台、高邑、焦作等九个地方的统计有二万万元之多，其中存入冀南银行者占百分之五十六点六，存入瑞华银行的占十七点一五，存入各银号（只邯郸、邢台统计银号在内）的占百分之二十五点二五。如以地区来说，邯郸比例最大占百分六十点六三，邢台其次占百分之二十六点七五，其他地点占百分之十二点六二。这说明了一个什么问题呢？说明了邯郸的金融是较集中的。
    收缩通货的第二个办法是收回到期商业放款，当时邯郸、邢台等地都有这样规定：（一）着重先收回活期放款（投机特别多），其次才是定期放款。（二）先收大商人后收小商人（小商人在市场起的作用究竟还小）。（三）着重收已到期者，酌情收不到期者。（四）其他工业、手工业、合作、农业、水利、运输是一面收一面放，惟商业是只收不放。根据这样原则，分配许多业务干部出去催收，结果催收数目是相当可观的。据初步统计各地冀南银行催收商贷的数目是：邯郸在一个月内催收一万万五千二百七十五万元占截止七月十六日实放数（以下同）的百分之八十八，邢台六天以内催收一千九百八十万元占实放数的百分之四十八强，高邑十天以内催收六百八十万，占实放数的百分之九十七强，长治五天以内催收一千三百万元，占实放数的百分之八十六点六七，武安二十三天以内催收了一千万元，占实放数的百分之八十三点三三，焦作（包括四分区各县在内）十四天内催收了一千六百余万，占实放数的百分之六十四，威县十五天内催收了三百万占实放数的百分之七十五。其他如肥乡、南宫、衡水三地共催收了三百万元，都是他们自己实放数的百分之百。总平均起来是十三天功夫，就这商业放款一项初步极不完全统计，十个地点即有一万万二千二百零三万余元之多，十分之七的地方催收任务完成了百分之八十以上。如以邯郸一地来说，自七月十六至七月三十一日的半月中，有将近一半的时间，每天收回一百万元以上的商贷，而在这个时间以内，是只放工业、手工业、运输业等而不放商业的。这说明收缩商贷转入生产政策的具体执行。
    收缩通货的第三个办法是不大批购贮物资而且出售物资：（一）各大商号，机关生产大批抛售物资，如粮食、食盐、棉花、土布、洋布等，在邯郸、邢台、武安等地都同时进行，迫使物价下降。（二）公私商号停购少购货物。重大需用既已解决，公营采购任务便不大量购买，私营商号也因容纳量已满，资金周转不太充裕，而暂维持现状，再加上自然条件（天透雨丰收）及军事上的胜利消息，一般出手物资日益增多的情况下，更增加了要买货物者的裹足不前了。（三）过去商人买货，还因为各地严重的不平衡而捣来捣去，而这次的紧缩却是一致步调，到银行贷不出款，无论何地皆如此，即使有些款，也由于差额不太大而不敢放手去干了。以邯郸来说，过去一个时期，资金不仅相当充裕，而且活动范围异常之广，到别处买来货一时卖不了，（价低就不卖）即可到银行银号去贷款，甚至甲家贷不出到乙家去贷，而今不行了。买来货如不出手的话，即不能继续活动，甲家贷不出款，到乙家也同样，因此对投机商人来说，不啻是一个迎头打击。
    收缩通货到现在已经一个月了，在这一个月内，对边区各地市场物价的平稳上有了显著的成效，一般物品之价格，都纷纷下跌下来，人心渐渐安定下来，说政府真正为群众办事，而且也真正有这个力量，如以太行区来说，高邑七月二十三日与八月八日相比，麦子每斗由一千二百元跌至八百至九百元，棉花每斤由四百五十元跌至二百六十元。邢台七月十六与七月二十相比小米每斗由一千五百元跌至一千二百卅元，麦子每斗由一千七百元跌至一千五百元，阳光市布每匹由三万四千元跌至二万八千五百元。武安八月六日与八月七日两天相比，麦子每斤由三十一元跌至二十八元，小米每斤由卅元跌至廿六元，食盐每斤由一百元跌至七十元，土布每斤由一千元跌至九百元。长治七月十九与七月二十五日相比，麦子由每斗一千五百元跌至五百元，小米由每斗一千元跌至四百元。另外在冀南区也同样，威县七月十六与八月七日相比，棉花由每斤五百元跌至四百元，麦子由每斗一千元跌至七百元，土布由每双市尺一百五十元跌至一百元。肥乡七月十六日与八月八日相比，土布每双市尺由一百三十元跌至九十元，棉花由每斤（加三秤）五百五十元跌至四百八十元，麦子每双市斗由一千五百元跌至一千二百元，小米跌的程度与小麦相差无几。南宫七月二十与八月七日相比，棉花每斤由七百元跌至四百元，土布每双市尺由一百五十元跌至一百十元，小米每斤由七十元跌至四十元，麦子每斤由九十元跌至七十元。外汇汇票每万元由四千一百元跌至三千三百四十元无人要。衡水七月十六日以前与八月六日相比，麦子每斗（十五斤）由八百五十元跌至七百五十元，小米之价比小麦略低，但跌的程度相同，盐每斤由七十二元跌至五十四元。从以上材料中可以看到以下几个问题：（一）从高邑、南宫、肥乡、威县、衡水等几个地点看起来，以七月十六前后相差不远的时间都作为一百基数计算的话，到八月七至八日前后二十来天，三个地点小米的平均指数下降至七五·一二，五个地点麦子的平均指数下降至七七·三七，三个地点土布的平均指数下降至七六·四一，四个地点棉花平均指数下降至七○·五五。就以这四种物价相比，下降指数差不多是一样趋势，勉强找差额的话，算以棉花小米下降速率较大，麦子土布略次。（二）各物跌价在地区上说是相当普遍的，冀鲁豫、太岳一时尚无材料报告，但就冀南、太行两区来说，东至衡水南宫，西至长治数百里之内，在一个时间一致下跌，这说明我们在平抑物价上的组织性，只要我们及时采取适当对策，物价是决不会如同国民党区汹汹上涨的。（三）物价跌价在工农业品上说是一致跌价的，而在程度上却又是渐趋下降趋势。过去往往是农产品跌价，工业品不一定跌价；今天不同了，农产品跌价，工业品也一样跌价，而且在速度上说都不是太猛烈。这一方面可以避免工农业产品剪刀差额过大，不使农民吃亏，另一方面，又不使在物价高时，工业手工业者购存一定食料原料而亏本。这就是说，工农业品一致下落并渐渐跌价，不仅照顾了农民，而且又照顾了工业手工业者，对广大群众是有利的。
    从这次收缩通货中看出些什么问题呢？（一）城市金融活动是以公营金融占主要地位的，这从存放款中可以看出来，从吞吐物资中也可以看出来。要想很好处理城市金融问题，必须慎重详密的处理公营金融（即公营资本）问题，这是金融问题的中心关键，也是决定工商业发达与否的重要因素，处理不好，不仅会影响工商业的发达与繁荣，而且也有关人民生活。（二）收缩通货工作必须有核心骨干，但决不可孤立进行，一个部门先下手难以收效，少数地点单独进行也很难达到预期目的。除考虑内外各方面条件成熟之外，还须有艰苦详密的组织工作。内外条件包括军事政治斗争形势，及群众的要求等，组织工作上包括各部门各地区步调一致交通通讯连系的迅速与及时等。
