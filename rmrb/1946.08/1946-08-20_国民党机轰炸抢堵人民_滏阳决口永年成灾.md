(From our newspaper's Handan dispatch) The Fuyang River water, which breached at Nanyan Village in Yongnian, is now flooding towards the city. Our local military and civilians are working together to block the breach. In late July, due to continuous summer rains, the Fuyang River rose sharply and finally breached on the 26th in Nanyan Village. When our local military and civilians were providing relief, they were suddenly subjected to continuous bombing and strafing by Kuomintang planes. The masses scattered to take cover, and the breach grew to an unmanageable size. Nine villages, including Luozhuang and Nanzhangzhuang, were flooded, and 5,000 mu of farmland were destroyed. Local people are extremely resentful of this atrocity by the Kuomintang.
    (From our newspaper's Heze dispatch) Our correspondent here refutes the rumor company Central News Agency's slanderous claim that the Eighth Route Army dug the canal dikes, causing the flooding of Liaocheng, stating: "Liaocheng is occupied by the notorious pro-Japanese traitors Wang Jinxiang and Zhao Zhenhua. The local Eighth Route Army liberated the four gates of the city before the January 13th ceasefire order. After the ceasefire order, the Eighth Route Army consistently defended its positions, while the traitors Wang and Zhao, with the support of He Siyuan, chairman of the Kuomintang Shandong Provincial Government, frequently invaded the liberated areas and engaged in looting. The Grand Canal, from Changgou, forty miles northwest of Jining, to Linqing, has long been dry during the War of Resistance. Recently, due to heavy rains, water has accumulated in the riverbed. The eastern gate of Liaocheng, through which the river flows, is the Eighth Route Army's position, while the city is held by puppet troops. There is absolutely no reason for the Eighth Route Army to divert water to drown themselves."

　　国民党机轰炸抢堵人民
    滏阳决口永年成灾
    【本报邯郸讯】在永年南沿村决口的滏阳河水，正向城关漫流，我当地军民正协力抢堵中。上月下旬因连绵夏雨，滏河陡涨，终于二十六日在南沿村决口，我当地军民正施救时，突遭国民党飞机连续轰炸扫射，群众纷纷躲避，决口处遂坐大至不可收拾、洛庄、南张庄等九村被淹，田禾被毁五千亩，当地群众对国民党此种暴行极为痛恨。
    【本报荷泽讯】此间记者驳斥谣言公司中央社污蔑八路军挖掘运堤水淹聊城之造谣称：“聊城为鲁西著名汉奸王金祥、赵振华所盘踞，当地八路军在一月十三日停战命令前即将该城四关解放，旋停战令下，八路军始终坚守自己阵地，而王赵二逆，则在国民党山东省主席何思源支援下，经常向解放区进犯，出外抢掠。运河自济宁西北四十里之长沟直至临清一段，在抗战中早就干涸，近因大雨，河身积水，该河流经之聊城东关为八路军阵地，城内则为伪军，八路军决无引水自溺之理。”
