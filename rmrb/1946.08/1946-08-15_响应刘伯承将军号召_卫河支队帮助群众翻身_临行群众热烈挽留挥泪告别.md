　　Responding to General Liu Bocheng's Call
	Weihe Detachment Helps the Masses to Overthrow Landlords
	Masses Enthusiastically Retain Them and Tearfully Bid Farewell Upon Departure
	[Our newspaper's report from Heze] The First Battalion of the Weihe Detachment, responding to General Liu Bocheng's call, is now actively helping the masses to overthrow landlords and realize "land to the tiller." In addition to ordering all officers and soldiers to strictly abide by mass discipline, disseminate propaganda, and help the masses, the responsible leaders have also selected 21 lower-level cadres and veteran liberated area soldiers from the battalion to form four civil affairs work groups to go to the sixth and seventh districts of Daokou and Yanjin to help the masses overthrow landlords, aiming to create experience by breaking through at one point. At the beginning, everyone raised difficulties such as "illiteracy," "lack of experience," and "wearing two-and-a-half chi [unit of measure] uniforms makes it difficult to approach the masses." The leaders said: "As long as you patiently approach the masses, rely on the masses, and work for the masses, these difficulties can be overcome." After arriving at their work posts, these comrades quickly integrated with the masses. The majority of the work group comrades were of peasant origin, and although they were illiterate, they highly demonstrated their class sentiments. They closely integrated with the members of the peasant association and the militia. Precisely because they were wearing two-and-a-half chi uniforms and carrying guns, in this border area (separated from the puppet and stubborn elements by only the Weihe River), they supported the masses, and the masses' courage was emboldened. They talked "heart-to-heart" with the masses, taught the militia to drill and sing, joined the masses in attacking special agents and guerrilla groups of the puppet and stubborn elements, and led the masses in carrying out the struggle to overthrow landlords. In just twenty-five days from June 12th to July 6th, they helped develop 303 peasant association members, organized 95 militiamen, mobilized 8 guns (for the militia), organized 245 children's corps members, organized women in two villages, reformed two peasant associations, and organized eleven struggles. ... In the struggle against the guerrilla groups of the puppet and stubborn elements, three people were captured, and the special agent activities of the puppet and stubborn elements were suppressed. Due to urgent tasks for the troops, the work team had to withdraw immediately. Before leaving, they said to the masses and village cadres: "We are going back for a meeting." But the masses blocked the road to retain them, and the village cadres of Xiaopu Village locked the door to prevent them from leaving. The masses of the North Small District said: "Comrades, help us to overthrow landlords to the end!" In the end, they could not be retained and tearfully bid farewell. When the civil affairs group comrades returned to report on their work, they talked about the situation when they parted with the masses, and tears welled up in their eyes. Their unanimous opinion was that the time was too short and they had not helped the masses to completely overthrow landlords. From this, they saw that helping the masses to get rid of their suffering in the movement to overthrow landlords also greatly enlightened the army's class consciousness. Therefore, the people's army directly helping the masses to overthrow landlords is also a very effective method of troop education. The battalion has decided that once the task is completed, they will be sent back to mass work to help the masses completely overthrow landlords.

　  响应刘伯承将军号召            
    卫河支队帮助群众翻身       
    临行群众热烈挽留挥泪告别
    【本报荷泽讯】卫河支队一大队，响应刘伯承将军的号召，现正积极帮助群众翻身，实现耕者有其田。负责首长除命令全体指战员严格遵守群众纪律宣传与帮助群众外，更在大队中抽调下级干部及老解放区战士二十一人组成四个民运工作组，分赴道口、延津的六七区帮助群众翻身，以突破一点创造经验。开始时大家提出，“不识字”。“没经验”。“穿上二尺半不好接近群众”等困难，领导上说：“只要耐心的接近群众，依靠群众，为群众办事，这些困难都可克服的”。到了工作岗位以后，这些同志很快的就与群众打成一片了。工作组绝大部分同志是农民出身，虽然不识字，但高度的表现出阶级情绪，他们与农会会员、民兵密切地结合起来。正因为穿着二尺半拿着枪，在这个边沿区（与伪顽仅隔一条卫河）给群众撑腰，群众的胆子放大了。他们和群众谈“知心话”教民兵上操、唱歌和群众一起打击特务与伪顽的游击小组，领导群众进行翻身斗争。仅从六月十二到七月六日的二十五天当中，帮助发展农会会员三百零三人，组织民兵九十五人，动员枪八枝（给民兵），组织儿童团二百四十五人，组织两村妇女，改造农会两个，组织斗争十一次。………在与伪顽的游击小组斗争中，捕获了三人，伪顽的特务活动被压下去了。由于部队有紧急任务，工作队不得不马上撤回，临走时对群众与村干部说：“我们回去开会”但群众纷纷拦路挽留，小铺村干部把门锁起不让走，北小区群众说：“同志们帮我们翻身就帮到底呀”。最后挽留不住洒泪而别。民运组同志回去在汇报工作时，谈到与群众分别时的情形，眼泪夺眶而出，一致意见是时间太短了，没帮群众彻底翻身。从此看到了帮助群众解除痛苦的翻身运动当中，也大大启发了军队的阶级自觉，所以人民的军队直接去帮助群众翻身，也是一种极有效的部队教育方法。大队已决定一旦任务完成，还是让他们再回到群运中去，帮助群众彻底翻身。
