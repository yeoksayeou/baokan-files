　　Fourteen Years of First Joy
　　Qiqihar People Commemorate "August 15th"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 15th] (Delayed dispatch) Today, the people of Qiqihar held an unprecedented "August 15th" anniversary celebration in the square in front of the "September 18th" National Humiliation Monument. This "September 18th" National Humiliation Monument was transformed from the so-called "Spirit Pagoda" built by the Japanese invaders by forcing the people of Qiqihar during the puppet Manchukuo regime. Today, in front of this building, the people of Qiqihar rejoiced for washing away fourteen years of national humiliation, and at the same time, they made impassioned speeches against another new national humiliation. The conference was held at 3 pm. Before the meeting, Yangko dances throughout the city began to promote the event. Trucks and more than 60,000 people from all walks of life crowded the streets, and every household was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. Men and women from within 20 miles of Qiqihar took cars to attend the meeting. On the field, red-tasseled spears of the Self-Defense Forces stood densely in a sea of people. After paying tribute to the martyrs of the Anti-Japanese War, Wang Shengrong, director of the Qiqihar All-Circles Federation, delivered the opening speech. In his free speech, Mr. Liu Chunqiao, an elementary school teacher, said: "August 15th" is the happiest day for us spiritually, but we have not forgotten those painful years of the past fourteen years. On the one hand, we thank the Democratic Allied Forces for cooperating with the Soviet Red Army to liberate the Northeast. At the same time, we must resolutely oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' betrayal of the country and dictatorial creation of a second "September 18th." Shi Jianhan, a worker at Qiqihar's largest flour mill, said: "Fourteen years ago, the Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed us. The Democratic Allied Forces and the Soviet Red Army rescued us from the fire pit. Now the Kuomintang reactionaries are trying to push us into the clutches of American imperialist elements. We resolutely oppose this shameless betrayal!" The conference ended and the parade began, with the procession stretching for five miles.

　　齐市人民纪念“八一五”
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十五日电】（迟到）齐市人民今日在“九一八”国耻纪念碑前广场，召开盛况空前的“八一五”一周年庆祝大会。此“九一八”国耻纪念碑，系伪满时日寇强迫齐市人民修筑的所谓“灵塔”改造而成。齐市人民今日在此建筑物前，为洗清了十四年的国耻而欢欣，同时为反对另一个新的国耻而激昂陈词。大会于下午三时举行，会前全市秧歌开始宣传，卡车及六万人以上的各界各业群众拥塞街道，家家张灯结彩，齐市周围二十里以内之男女群众，皆乘车赶来开会。全场上自卫队的红缨枪，林立在一片人海中，大会在向抗战烈士致哀后，由齐市各界联合会主任王盛荣致开会词。在自由讲话中，小学教员刘纯诮先生说：“八一五”是我们精神上最欢乐的日子，但是我们也没有忘掉过去十四年那些苦痛的岁月，我们一方面感谢民主联军配合苏联红军解放东北，同时要坚决反对国民党反动派卖国独裁制造第二个“九一八”。齐市最大的火磨工厂工人石健韩说：“十四年前，国民党反动派出卖过我们，民主联军及苏联红军将我们从火坑中救出来，现在国民党反动派又要把我们推到美国帝国主义分子的统治魔爪下，我们坚决反对这种无耻的出卖”！大会结束即开始游行，行列长达五里。
