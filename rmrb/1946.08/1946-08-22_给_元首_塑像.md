Sculpting a Statue for the "Leader"
    Lù Dīng
            I am a skilled craftsman in China.

    I heard that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War is thanks to the "Leader's" "merit"!
    The "Leader" equipped the army with American guns and cannons,
    He is now sparing no effort for the cause of "nation-building";
    I decided to sculpt a great statue for the "Leader."
    ×              ×            ×               ×
    A country's "leader" always needs a statue,
    It should be extraordinary,
    The statue I sculpt must befit the "Leader's" status;
    I brought out the statues of past Chinese emperors,
    Carefully referring to them will help me sculpt it better!
    ×              ×              ×              ×
    But I was finally surprised and disappointed,
    Nothing is as uniquely "magnificent" as the "Leader"!
    Although Qin Shi Huang and Qin Hui still have some similar figures to him,
    They cannot match the "Leader's" abilities today!
    ×              ×              ×              ×
    Oh,
    I forgot:
    The "Leader" has concentrated the traditional experience of the "special" character from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign.
    The "Leader's" career is "special" and "beautiful"!
    ×              ×              ×              ×
    Alas! Where can I find statues from past Chinese dynasties?
    Where can I find such complex and diverse materials in China today?
    Seeing that I, a skilled craftsman, cannot sculpt it,
    Alas!
    I suppose it will have to be made in America in the future!

　　给“元首”塑像
    路丁
            我是中国一个精细的工匠。
　
    听说抗战胜利是“元首”的“功劳”！
    “元首”用美国的枪炮武装着军队，
    他现在为“建国”的事业不遗余力；
    我决定要给“元首”塑个大好的像。
    ×              ×            ×               ×
    一个国的“元首”总须要一副塑像呀，
    它应该是不平凡的，
    我塑出来不能不适合“元首”的身份；
    我搬出中国历代的塑像来，
    仔细参看着是会塑得更好些！
    ×              ×              ×              ×
    但我终于失望的惊讶起来，
    什么都不及“元首”那样特有的“雄伟”！？
    秦始皇、秦桧虽然还有些类似他的形影，
    但却都抵不上今天的“元首”的本领！
    ×              ×              ×              ×
    哦，
    我倒忘记了：
    “元首”是集中了古今中外“特”字的传统经验的。
    “元首”的事业是“特”别又“美”化的呀！
    ×              ×              ×              ×
    唉！中国历代的塑像那里找得到？
    中国现在那来这样复杂多样的材料？
    眼看我这精细的工匠也塑不成，
    唉！
    大约只好留待将来美国造！
