　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th: Changchun dispatch: Since the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters of the Kuomintang suddenly announced the ban on 100-yuan Red Army currency notes, it has caused great chaos in the market here. This 9.725 billion yuan of Red Army currency was originally issued by the Soviet military authorities stationed in Northeast China with the consent of the Kuomintang government to be used as military expenses. This sudden announcement of the ban, allowing only one-tenth of the face value for exchange and limiting registration and redemption to within ten days, has caused public anxiety. The day before the ban was the end-of-month payday, and the salaries issued to civil servants and others were all in Red Army currency, which became waste paper the next day. After the ban was announced, the entire city was in panic. Gao Chengye, who made a living by collecting scraps and sundries, recently sold his collected items for 23,000 yuan and was planning to repay his debts. He suffered this blow and committed suicide because he could not make a living. However, Chiang's troops and police still forced people to buy goods at the original value with this currency, forcing many shops to close. Near Dongda Bridge, Kuomintang military police even caused a conflict when they forcibly bought pork with Red Army currency. Kuomintang agencies took the opportunity to make money and commit fraud, underreporting the amount of Red Army currency they held and smuggling large amounts of Red Army currency to the Liberated Areas to steal materials, causing prices to rise everywhere. The Kuomintang authorities in Northeast China not only did not try to remedy this situation, but adopted high-pressure measures. On August 3rd, Wang Wenjia, the special commissioner of the Central Bank in Northeast China, openly threatened citizens and vendors, saying, "Those who attempt to disrupt the market with rumors and vendors who refuse to use it will be severely punished," but the public's dissatisfaction has only increased. The Huasheng Daily commented on the matter, saying, "This method has created a huge wave in people's lives, making people feel pain and disappointment," because this matter "is really too important to the economic life of the people in Northeast China." Even the Northeast Kuomintang newspaper, the Xinsheng Daily, had to admit that this matter had caused "great commotion among the people in Changchun, Shenyang, and other parts of Northeast China," and admitted that "in the past two or three days, what we have seen and heard is nothing but sad faces and resentful voices." The newspaper also said: A year ago, when the Red Army currency was first circulated, the authorities issued a notice allowing the public to use it at a one-to-one ratio. Five months ago, the authorities issued another notice advising the public not to panic themselves. When the news of this ban on the Red Army currency was released, the authorities even stated that they would never allow the public to suffer excessive losses. Unexpectedly, this time the notice is such a method, how can it not make the public lose confidence in the government?
　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 20th: Chiang Kai-shek's Northeast Headquarters announced on the 1st that the use of 100-yuan Red Army currency notes would be stopped, and a large number of Red Army currency notes were squeezed into the Liberated Areas to plunder materials. Democratic governments in Northeast China had no choice but to take countermeasures, announcing on the 8th that the currency would be suspended from use and taking appropriate measures to relieve the people's hardships. The Nenjiang Provincial Government stipulated the following measures: (1) First register the 100-yuan Red Army currency in Qiqihar, count the total amount of currency in the city, the currency will be temporarily kept by private individuals, and grain will be transported to Qiqihar to regulate the grain supply. (2) Northeast Bank local circulating notes of ten, fifty, and one hundred yuan are allowed to circulate at marked prices. (3) Grain loans will be provided to the urban poor, commercial loans to small and medium-sized merchants, and agricultural loans to farmers. The provincial government has now allocated 1.1 million yuan to issue temporary interest-free loans, with 1 million yuan to relieve the poor in Qiqihar.

　　东北国民党当局禁用红军票
    市面紊乱民众不满
    民主政府设法解民困
    【新华社哈尔滨二十日电】长春讯：自国民党东北行营经济委员会突然宣布禁用红军票百元券后，引起此间市面大紊乱。此项九十七亿二千五百万元的红军钞票，原为苏联驻东北军事当局取得国民党政府同意而发行充作军费者。此次突然宣布停用，并只准兑换币值十分之一，限十日内登记收兑。停用前一日为月底发薪期，公务员等所发之薪悉系红军票，次日顿成废纸。宣布停用后，全市人心惶惶。以收买破烂杂物为业的高承业，日前将其所收买的物品卖得二万三千元，正拟偿还欠债，突遭此打击，因无法生活，乃自杀而死。但蒋方军警犹持该票强迫以原值购物，致使许多商店被迫停业。东大桥一带，国民党军警于持红军票强买猪肉时竟酿成冲突；国民党各机关并乘机发财舞弊，将现存之红军票以少报多，将大量红军票偷运至解放区盗买物资，致使各地物价高涨。国民党东北当局对此非但不设法补救，却采用高压手段。八月三日，中央银行东北特派员王文笳竟公然恫吓市民商贩称：“对企图扰乱市面造谣之徒及拒绝使用之商贩将予以严厉处分”，而群众之不满却愈益增加。华声报于评论此事时称：“这个办法给人民生活掀起了巨波，使人民感觉痛苦失望”，因此事“关系东北人民经济生活实在太大”。甚至连东北国民党机关报新生报亦不得不承认此事在“长春沈阳两市及东北各地民众都起了莫大骚动”，承认“两三日来眼里所见到的耳里所听到的，无非愁苦之容和悲愤之声”。该报并称：一年以前，当红军票最初流通时，当局曾出布告让民众一比一的使用，五个月前，当局又布告劝民众勿自惊扰。而当此次禁用红军票之消息传出时，当局更曾表示决不使民众过度损失。想不到现在这一次的布告竟是这样一个办法，怎能不使民众对于政府失去了信心？
    【新华社齐齐哈尔二十日电】蒋介石东北行辕于一日宣布停止红军票百元券使用，并将大批红军票挤向解放区，掠夺物资。东北各地民主政府不得不采取抵制办法，于八日宣布该票暂停使用，并采取适当措施以解民困。嫩江省府规定了下列办法：（一）先于齐市登记百元红军票，统计全市票额，该票暂由私人保存，并运粮至齐市调剂粮食。（二）东北银行地方流通券十元、五十元、一百元三种准予标价流通。（三）将对城市贫民举行粮贷，对中小商人举行商贷，对农民举行农贷。省府现已拨款一百一十万元发放临时的无息贷款，以一百万元救济齐市贫民。
