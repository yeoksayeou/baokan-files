Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 18th: Paris dispatch: The Bulgarian and Hungarian Political Territorial Committees held meetings on the afternoon of the 17th to conduct elections. The Byelorussian representative Kiselev and the Yugoslav representative Stanković were elected as chairmen respectively. At the Bulgarian Political Territorial Committee meeting, the Byelorussian representative Kiselev was unanimously elected as chairman upon the suggestion of the British representative Zinin, and the New Zealand representative Young was unanimously elected as vice-chairman upon the suggestion of the Ukrainian representative Manuilsky. The Soviet representative Novikov raised the same argument that had been put forward in other committees, advocating that only those countries that had effectively waged war against Bulgaria should have the right to vote (thus France only retains the right to be consulted without the right to vote). The French representative Mouville, supported by Britain and the United States, expressed opposition, and the meeting was adjourned. At the Hungarian Political Territorial Committee meeting, the Yugoslav representative Stanković was unanimously elected as chairman upon the suggestion of Canada, and the Czechoslovak representative was unanimously elected as rapporteur upon the suggestion of Australia. The Soviet representative Gusev stated that only those countries that had effectively waged war against Hungary should have the right to vote. The French representative Mouville disagreed, and the British and American representatives supported the French representative's opinion, and the meeting adjourned. Further news: The conference passed a motion by fifteen votes to six (those opposed were Byelorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union) to invite Austria to express its views on the Italian peace treaty issue. After the Austrian attendance proposal was passed, the Soviet Union immediately moved that a similar invitation should be extended to Iran. The representative of the Kuomintang government expressed approval, and the United States agreed. The proposal was finally unanimously passed.

　　保、匈两国政治领土委员会
　  主席已经分别选出
　　关于对意和约将邀请奥、伊参加表示意见
    【新华社延安十八日电】巴黎讯：十七日下午保加利亚政治领土委员会与匈牙利政治领土委员会开会进行选举，白俄罗斯代表吉塞勒夫及南斯拉夫代表斯坦科维赤分别被选为主席。保加利亚政治领土委员会会议上，白俄罗斯代表吉塞勒夫由英代表泽宁建议被一致选为主席，新西兰代表约昂由乌克兰代表曼奴意斯基建议被一致选为副主席。苏代表诺维科夫提出在其他委员会上所提出的同样论点，主张只给那些曾经有效的对保加利亚作过战的国家以投票权（因而法国仅保有被谘询之权无投票权）。慕维尔代表法国，在英美支持下表示反对，会议即行结束。匈牙利政治领土委员会上，南斯拉夫代表斯坦科维赤由加拿大建议被一致选为主席，捷代表经澳代表建议被一致选为报告人。苏代表古赛夫发言称：只有那些曾经有效地对匈牙利作过战的国家才有权出席投票，法代表慕维尔不同意，英美代表支持法代表意见，会议即告散会。又讯：和会以十五票对六票（反对者为白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克、乌克兰、南斯拉夫及苏联）通过邀请奥国出席表示其关于对意和约问题的意见。在通过奥国出席之提案后，苏联立即动议对伊朗应有相似的邀请，国民党政府代表表示赞成，美国表示同意，该提议终于一致通过。
