　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. Paris Dispatch: The Plenary Session of the Peace Conference and the Program Rules Committee continued to meet separately on the 1st. Representatives of various countries continued to make general speeches at the Plenary Session. Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Pötzel, Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Mr. Kardelj, Representative of New Zealand, Mr. Nashan, and Representative of Norway, Mr. Lange, all delivered speeches on the day. The Program Rules Committee continued its debate on the 1st. The issue of the number of votes required to pass resolutions in the Plenary Session and various subcommittees remains unresolved. According to American participants: Mr. Byrnes is prepared to propose a compromise between the two opinions, namely, important proposals that fail to obtain a two-thirds vote may still be submitted to the Four Powers for consideration, but can only be sent as "proposals" without the full force of formal "recommendations" from the meeting. According to a United Press reporter's analysis: Judging from the current situation, nine countries are certain to support a two-thirds majority vote: the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. Abyssinia, New Zealand, Norway, and Brazil may also vote in favor. The confirmed opponents are currently Australia, the Netherlands, and Greece. When the Program Rules Committee met yesterday, the Greek representative, Mr. Sindaris, suggested that provisions should be made to allow free discussion of any issue "concerning a just and lasting peace." The Yugoslavian representative opposed the Greek representative's amendment, arguing that this would cause the meeting to fall into lengthy debates beyond the time allotted for the issue of drafting the Five-Power peace treaty. If the Greek proposal is adopted, any delegation will effectively be able to place any item on the agenda. Mr. Molotov put forward a compromise proposal, suggesting that the rules of procedure of the meeting could be amended to add the following sentence: "On any issue concerning the draft peace treaty, the Plenary Session may include it in the meeting agenda upon the application of any delegation." Mr. ×× Dovate advised all small countries to accept this proposal, and it was declared passed. Afterwards, the committee encountered difficulties again. The Dutch representative demanded that all twenty-one countries should be represented not only on the Steering Committee but also on all committees, while the original decision of the Four Powers was that all committees except the Steering Committee should be handed over to the countries that had actually acted against each relevant defeated country. Mr. Molotov put forward a new compromise proposal, namely, to allow all twenty-one countries to attend any committee meeting, but other countries would have no voting rights except for those that had actually fought against the respective defeated countries. The outcome of the discussion is unknown.

　　程序规则委员会继续辩论通过决议票数问题未解决
    【新华社延安二日电】巴黎讯：和会之大会与程序规则委员会于一日仍在分别举行，各国代表继续在大会上作一般发言，荷外长波茨雷、南副总理卡德尔、新西兰代表纳森、挪威代表兰吉均于是日发表演说。程序规则委员会于一日继续辩论，会中关于大会与各小组委员会通过决议所需票数问题仍未解决。据美国与会人士宣称：贝纳斯准备在两种意见之间提出一种妥协办法，即未能获得三分之二票数之重要提案仍可提交四强考虑，但仅能当作“提议”送交，而无会议正式“建议”的充分力量。据合众社记者分析：就现势看来，有九个国家一定赞成三分之二多数表决的，有美、英、苏、法、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、南斯拉夫与捷克，而阿比西尼亚、新西兰、挪威及巴西亦可能投赞成票，确定反对者，现为澳洲、荷兰及希腊。程序规则委员会于昨日开会时，希腊代表新达利斯建议应规定允许对任何“有关公正持久和平”的问题进行自由的讨论，南代表反对希代表的修正案，认为此将使会议陷于超过制定五国和约问题时间之外的长时争论，如果希腊之建议通过，则任何代表团实际上均将能在议事日程上安置任何项目。莫洛托夫提出妥协案，建议会议规则程序可以修改，其中增加下述语句：“关于和约草案之任何问题，倘经任何代表团之申请时，大会得将其列入会议程序”。××多瓦特劝告所有小国接受此一提议，于是宣告通过。此后委员会又遇到困难，荷代表要求二十一国不仅在指导委员会而且在一切委员会应有代表参加，而四强原来的决定是除指导委员会之外，一切委员会均应交诸对每个有关战败国实际作用的国家。莫洛托夫又提出新的妥协案，即准许所有二十一国参加任何委员会的会议，但除了对各该战败国实际作战之国家外，其他国家无表决权。讨论结果未悉。
