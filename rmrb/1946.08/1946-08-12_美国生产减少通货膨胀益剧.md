Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. New York Dispatch: The American automobile industry, one of the major industries, has only produced 1.25 million cars from January 1st to August 1st this year. In the same period of 1941 before the Pearl Harbor Incident, 3.5 million cars were produced, a reduction of 2.5 million cars. General Motors (whose output accounts for 51% of the total U.S. output) alone reduced production by one million cars. Due to the reduction in production, inflation is intensifying, and it is estimated that each car will increase in price by one U.S. dollar when the Office of Price Administration is restored this time. Furthermore, U.S. steel production has also been greatly reduced. To date, due to steelworkers' strikes, coal miners' strikes, etc., more than 7 million tons have been reduced, accounting for more than one-ninth of the total output. Republican Senators Wheeler (a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee) and Capehart stated on the 4th that if the United States cannot increase steel production, it will suffer a serious crisis.

　　美国生产减少通货膨胀益剧
    【新华社延安七日电】纽约讯：美国主要工业之一的汽车业，自今年元旦以迄八月一日，仅生产汽车一百二十五万辆。在珍珠港事变前，一九四一年同一时期中，则生产三百五十万辆，计减产二百五十万辆。仅通用汽车公司（该公司产量为美国总量的百分之五十一）亦即减产一百万辆。由于生产减少，通货膨胀益剧，而此次物价管制局恢复时，估计汽车每辆将增价一个美元。又美国钢的产量亦大为减少，截至目前为止，因钢铁工人罢工，煤业工人罢工等原因，已减少七百余万吨，减少总产量九分之一以上。共和党参议员维勒（外委会委员之一）及开普尔四日声称：美国如不能增加钢产，则将遭受严重危机。
