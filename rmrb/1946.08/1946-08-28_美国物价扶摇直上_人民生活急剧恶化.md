　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: Reports from various sources indicate that prices in the United States are constantly rising, the people's lives are deteriorating, and strikes are about to follow one after another. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics declared that the selling price of food in the United States has risen by 31.3 percent since June 30 (when price controls were suspended), and more than 40 percent since the victory over Japan. In the week ending August 17 (before price restrictions were reimposed on the 20th), food rose by 3.4 percent, and grain products by 4.2 percent. The selling prices of meat, dairy products, butter, milk powder, and molded butter continued to rise. According to the Price Administration, the retail price limit for lamb will be increased by five or six cents per pound compared to June 30, and various solid fuels such as coal will increase by 18 cents per ton (having already increased by 50 cents before June 30). The price of white coal and coke will increase by 30 cents, and some women's underwear will also be allowed to increase in price. However, during the same period, the income of more than 50 million consumers who rely on wages has not increased, and it can be foreseen that the people's lives will inevitably deteriorate. The United Automobile Workers Union launched a wage increase movement in the automobile industry on the 21st, representing 80,000 workers demanding to reopen negotiations with the Chrysler Corporation.

　　美国物价扶摇直上
    人民生活急剧恶化
    【新华社延安二十五日电】各方报导：美物价不断上涨，人民生活恶化，罢工又将接踵而来。美劳工统计局宣称：美国粮食售价自六月三十日（物价管制中止）以来，已上涨百分之三十一点三，而自对日胜利以来则增高百分之四十以上，截至八月十七日为止之一星期内（二十日物价重新限制），粮食涨百分之三点四，谷类产物百分之四点二，肉类、乳类、牛酪、奶粉与模造牛酪之售价继续上涨不已。另据物价管理局称：羊肉零售，限价将较六月三十日每磅提高五、六分，其他煤炭及各种固体燃料每吨均上涨一角八分（按六月卅日以前即曾提高五角），白煤焦炭等则上涨三角，妇女所用之若干内衣亦准许涨价。但在此同一时期中五千余万靠工资生活之消费者的收入又并未提高，可以预见人民生活必将恶化。联合汽车工人工会于二十一日已发动汽车工业之增资运动，代表八万工人要求与克利斯劳公司重开谈判。
