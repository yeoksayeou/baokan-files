　　Socialist Competition Widely Carried Out
    Soviet Production Increased Sharply in July
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st] Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Union has entered the second half of the first year of the post-war five-year plan. Since the beginning of July, many large enterprises have exceeded their plans. The Yelyuf Machine Manufacturing Plant plans to exceed the production of the first half of the year by more than 50% in the second half of this year. The Ural Machine Manufacturing Plant, the Stalin Metal Plant, and many other plants are taking the lead in July production. Thanks to the implementation of a wide-ranging socialist competition to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule, the efforts of the Soviet people have achieved remarkable success. In the Donets Basin, as a result of the competition, production in the first five months of this year exceeded the plan by 180 trains of coal, 400 tons of pig iron, 46,000 tons of steel, and 31,000 tons of rolled metal. The Stakhanovite movement to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule has spread throughout Leningrad. Leningrad has become a birthplace of advanced production technology. For example, 62 Stakhanovites at the Kirov Factory have exceeded their annual production volume.
