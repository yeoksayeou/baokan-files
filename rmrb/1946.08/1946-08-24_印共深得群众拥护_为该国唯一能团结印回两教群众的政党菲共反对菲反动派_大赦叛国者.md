Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. Dutt, a leader of the British Communist Party, wrote in the British "Labour Monthly" in May: The Communist Party of India has become an indispensable leader of the Indian working class and organized farmers. Today it has 30,000 members (only 5,000 in 1942). It is the third largest party in India. It is the only party that has achieved success in uniting Indian and Muslim masses in various political party organizations. It has a majority of seats in the Trade Union Congress and its main leadership organizations. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Trade Union Congress has grown from 196,000 members in early 1943 to 600,000 today, while the number of peasant association members has grown from 226,000 in 1942 to 830,000 in 1944.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. Manila dispatch: Progressive people from the Philippine Communist Party, the Democratic Alliance, and other democratic groups are preparing for a mass rally to oppose the "amnesty for political traitors," because recently some Philippine reactionaries and Filipino traitors have been advocating their so-called amnesty movement for political traitors, attempting to exempt all Filipino traitors from punishment and restore their anti-people activities. On the 18th, the reactionaries held a so-called mass rally in Manila to support the amnesty movement, attempting to create "public opinion." The reactionaries attempted to mobilize 30,000 people to participate, but less than 2,000 people attended.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. Manila dispatch: Felio, one of the leaders of the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army, sternly refused to hand over the weapons of the People's Anti-Japanese Army at the "peace conference" arranged by Interior Minister Sulute on the 17th. He solemnly stated: It is impossible for the People's Anti-Japanese Army to surrender its weapons; the victors should be the final winners. Since the liberation of the Philippines, the US-Philippine army and the Philippine constabulary have launched countless sweeps against the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army in central Luzon, all of which have failed. The Philippine authorities are still setting traps, wanting the People's Anti-Japanese Army to hand over their weapons and then allow farmers to participate in local councils; however, the People's Anti-Japanese Army pointed out that the reactionaries are stepping up their arms buildup in an attempt to eliminate the People's Anti-Japanese Army and seize the fruits won by the peasants in the anti-Japanese war. Therefore, the latter has no reason to surrender their weapons. The Philippine Interior Minister then invited the governors of the provinces in central Luzon (mostly representatives of landlords) and the leaders of the People's Anti-Japanese Army to hold this meeting in Malacañang, attempting to threaten the People's Anti-Japanese Army into unconditional surrender.

　　为该国唯一能团结印回两教群众的政党菲共反对菲反动派“大赦叛国者”
    【新华社延安廿一日电】英共领袖之一杜德，在五月份的英国“劳工月刊”上著文称：印度共产党已成为印度工人阶级及有组织农民的不可忽视的领袖，今天它有三万党员（一九四二年只五千人），它是印度的第三大党，它是在各政党组织内团结印回两教的第三大党，它是在各政党组织内团结印回两教群众唯一有成绩的政党，它在职工大会及其主要的领袖组织中获有多数席位。职工大会在共产党的领导下，已由一九四三年初的十九万六千人发展到今天的六十万人，农民协会会员则已由一九四二年的二十二万六千人发展成为一九四四年的八十三万人。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】马尼拉讯：菲律滨共产党、民主大同盟及其他民主团体的进步人士，刻正筹备反对“大赦政治叛国者”的群众大会，因最近有一部分菲反动分子及菲奸，正在大倡其所谓大赦政治叛国者运动，图使一切菲奸免却惩处，并恢复其反人民活动。十八日，反动派曾在马尼拉召开所谓赞同大赦运动的群众大会，企图制造“民意”。反动派曾为此企图动员三万人前去参加，结果到会者不及二千人。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】马尼拉讯：菲人民抗日军领袖之一斐利奥，十七日在内长苏鲁泰布置的“和平会议”上，严词拒绝缴出民抗军的枪械。他严重声言：欲人民抗日军缴械乃不可能之事，应使战胜者为最后胜利者。按自菲律滨解放以来，美菲军及菲宪兵曾对吕宋岛中部的菲律滨人民抗日军展开无数次扫荡，结果均告失败。菲当局仍布置圈套，要民抗军缴枪后允许农民参加地方议会；但民抗军指出：反动派正加紧武装，企图消灭民抗军，套取农民在抗日中争得的果实。故后者决无缴械理由。菲内长乃约请吕宋中部各省省长（多数为地主代表）及民抗军领袖三人在马拉干举行这次会议，企图威胁民抗军无条件降服。
