　　Defend the Homeland, Defend Peace
    Shandong People Enthusiastically Join the Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 25th] To defend their homeland, the people of Shandong are sending their sons and urging their husbands to rush to the front lines of self-defense. The first batch of 12,000 militia rotation teams in the Luzhong District have already gone to the battlefield, and another 140,000 militia are wiping their guns and preparing to depart. At the "August 19th" anti-civil war mobilization meeting in the Lunan District, 3,500 young people voluntarily signed up to join the army that day. In the Binhai District, more than 1,700 militiamen have gone to the front lines. Within three days, 54 residents of various towns in Zaozhuang enthusiastically joined the picket team to protect the mining area with arms. On the 7th, over ten thousand people in Zhucheng gathered to send off 348 war heroes to the front lines, shouting: "Chiang Kai-shek wants to be a son of American imperialism and oppress our people!" The crowd below was filled with excitement, and unanimously roared: "Swear to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!" Then a woman stepped onto the stage and said: "Chiang Kai-shek is jealous of our liberation and wants to ruin us. I've told my two sons and five adopted sons to go to the self-defense front lines. Don't come back until you've driven away those bad guys!" Li Dama and Wang Dama from Li Village Four in Hedong District, Lin Yi County, personally sent their sons to the front lines, repeatedly urging them: "Good sons, go! Don't come back without peace!" Xiangban Gao Yuya personally sent her fiancé to the front lines, encouraging him at parting: "We'll reunite after we drive away the reactionaries!"
