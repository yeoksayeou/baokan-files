(This article was transmitted by our newspaper from Yangcheng on the 31st) Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops attacked along the Tongpu Railway line from both north and south, and on the 28th, they once again captured important towns such as Lingshi Jingsheng and Huoxian Jinbi. In order to prevent Yan's troops from continuing to reinforce and invade along the railway, the local Eighth Route Army resolutely counterattacked and captured Nanguan Station and Yangjiashan, two important locations on the Lingshi-Tongpu Railway, which our army liberated from the enemy and puppet forces on October 28th last year and were occupied by Yan's troops in December. Wangzhuang, an important town north of Huoxian City, was also liberated at the same time, and the Linghuo line has been cut off by our army. In the afternoon of the same day, more than 300 Yan's troops, under the cover of Kuomintang aircraft, launched another fierce attack on our positions, but were repelled.

(This article was transmitted by our newspaper from Changzhi on the 31st) Fancun Town in Taigu, which was once again occupied by Yan's troops at the end of last month, has been liberated under the firm self-defense of the military and civilians in the county. The previous re-occupation of Fancun by Yan's troops was intended to control the Taigu Plain area in order to achieve their plan of plundering 100,000 dan of wheat. However, in the past month, the military and civilians of Taigu have carried out a heroic struggle of self-defense and encirclement, so that Yan's attempt ultimately failed.

(This article was transmitted by our newspaper from Yangcheng on the 31st) Chiang Kai-shek's invading army, which has been severely hit by the Eighth Route Army in southern Shanxi, is now gathering between Wenxi and Shuitou. So far, the Chiang's army gathered in the area has reached four divisions, including the 47th Division, the 78th Division, the 167th Division, and the New 1st Division. The 53rd Division of Chiang's army, originally stationed in Potou and Yezhu areas of Meng County in northern Henan, was also transferred to Anyi on the evening of the 19th. Currently, Chiang's army on that line is rushing to build fortifications overnight, preparing to wait for an opportunity to invade us.

(Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 1st) In the fierce battles in the eastern and central sections of the Jiaoji Railway, the Eighth Route Army recovered Zhilanzhuang Station and inflicted heavy damage on the invading army. The 8th Division of the 74th Army of Chiang's troops, which attacked from the west of Jiaoxian City, occupied Zhilanzhuang Station on the Jiaoji Railway, 25 miles west of Jiaoxian City, on the 25th of last month, and continued to expand outwards. The Eighth Route Army fought bravely in self-defense and recovered the station on the 28th, advancing to a location 10 miles west of Jiaoxian City. In the battle, two battalions of the 8th Division of Chiang's army were completely annihilated, and two other battalions suffered heavy losses. More than 200 people, including the commander of the 22nd Regiment of the division, laid down their weapons. In addition, the main force of the Honor 1st Division and the 166th Division of the 8th Army of Chiang's troops, concentrated in Zhangdian, had begun to invade eastward along the railway on the 25th of last month. On the 26th, they sneaked past Jinling Town and invaded Xindian Station (more than ten miles east of Zhangdian). The Eighth Route Army fought bravely in self-defense and is currently engaged in fierce battles.
