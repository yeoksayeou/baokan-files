　　Army and Government University Overturn Team Goes Deep into the Masses
    Huangliangmeng and Other Villages Launch Class Struggle

    Cooperating with Mass Movements to Establish Rural Clinics
    [Our Newspaper, Handan News] The mass movement in the first district of Handan is unfolding. After the Army and Government University Overturn Team arrived and spent many days understanding the situation and deeply mobilizing the masses, the movement gradually began in various villages. Huangliangmeng, Guilonggang, Congzhong, Dongxitaili, Sucao, Suli, and others have successively launched fierce struggles against traitors, village bullies, conducting class struggle， settling accounts and venting grievances. Individual, small group, and even mass rallies to pour out grievances followed one after another, and the masses' fighting spirit was unprecedentedly high. Children's, women's, labor unions, farmers' associations, and militia organizations have all been established. Although hidden Kuomintang special agents are doing their best to carry out sabotage activities, the masses have realized that "overturning requires struggle" and must achieve the goal of "land to the tiller," and are pushing the movement to a climax.

    [Another Dispatch] The Army and Government University Overturn Team, in order to cooperate with the mass movement in the first district, serve the people, promote rural health and medical work, and eliminate diseases and disasters, has specially established a mass clinic in Huangliangmeng Village. After a week of preparation and obtaining a large number of drugs, it has begun providing medical treatment. According to Dr. Cao of the clinic: Since the advertisements were posted, many people have come for treatment every day. The masses receiving treatment all said, "The Eighth Route Army really considers everything for the people, even thinking about us when we are sick. The Eighth Route Army is truly a blessing for the people." The clinic is also preparing to launch a large-scale hygiene campaign throughout the district after the masses have overturned, which will greatly help reduce the incidence of diseases among the masses.

　　军政大学翻身队深入群众
    黄梁梦等村展开清算     
    配合群运设立乡村医疗所
    【本报邯郸讯】邯郸一区群运在开展中。军政大学翻身队到达后，经过多日的了解与深入的发动，运动逐渐在各村开展起来。黄梁梦、贵龙岗、丛冢、东西台里、苏曹、苏里等都先后展开了反奸、反村恶霸、清算诉苦的激烈斗争，由个人、小组、直到大会诉苦相继不断，群众斗争情绪空前高涨。儿童妇女工会农会民兵各种组织都已建立起来，虽暗藏国特分子尽力进行破坏活动，但群众已觉悟到“翻身就得斗争”，一定要达到“耕者有其田”的目的，正把运动推向高潮。（寒风）
    【又讯】军政大学翻身队，为着配合一区的群众运动，为人民服务，推广乡村卫生医疗工作，消灭病灾，特在黄梁梦村设一群众诊疗所。经过一周的筹备与构到大批药物后已开始诊疗，据该所曹医生谈：自广告贴出后，每日就诊者甚多，受诊群众都说：“八路军真是什么都为老百姓打算，就连害病也在想着，八路军真是老百姓的福星。”该所并还准备在群众翻了身以后在全区发动一个大卫生运动，这对群众疾病之减少，将大有帮助。（寒风）
