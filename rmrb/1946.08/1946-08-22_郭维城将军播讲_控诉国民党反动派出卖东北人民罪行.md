　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 15th (delayed dispatch): General Guo Weicheng, former confidential secretary to General Zhang Xueliang and commander of the 110th Division of the Northeast Army, delivered a speech on the eve of "August 15th" at the Xinhua Broadcasting Station here, denouncing the Kuomintang reactionaries' crimes of betraying the people of Northeast China fourteen years ago. Guo stated: At the time of the "September 18th" Incident, General Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing more than ten times in one night from Beiping for instructions, but Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly telegraphed back, forbidding resistance and ordering that the guns be collected, the warehouses locked up, and everything handed over to the Japanese army. These telegrams are still preserved to this day, and Chiang Kai-shek cannot deny them. Guo continued in a sorrowful tone, describing the tragic situation of the Northeast compatriots who fled to Guannei (areas south of the Great Wall), where they were oppressed and discriminated against, stating: After the "September 18th" Incident, tens of millions of Northeast compatriots, with tears in their eyes and full of enthusiasm, hoped to receive the government's support and return to the Northeast as soon as possible. However, the compatriots who fled to Guannei were branded as "slaves of a fallen country" by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Three hundred thousand Northeast Army soldiers were first thrown into the anti-communist war and eventually completely disintegrated and eliminated. We want to ask Chiang Kai-shek: What crime did General Zhang Xueliang and Commander Huang Xiansheng commit for loving their country and resisting Japan that they are still being arrested and detained to this day? Why were patriotic military leaders like Army Commander Wang Yizhe and Brigade Commander Gao Fuyuan put to death? All patriotic and progressive people of Northeast China have become thorns in Chiang Kai-shek's side. Zhou ×× (unclear in the telegram), Secretary-General of the Fuxing Society and Director of the Political Department of the Lu Su War Zone, even said to General Yu Xuezhong: "The Northeast Army soldiers are all sinners of the nation and the race; killing one is one less." The Northeast Army soldiers who fled to Guannei, under the Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of excluding dissidents, either died or were mostly unemployed if they survived. The families of some middle and lower-ranking officers were left unattended, leading to old and young becoming beggars and women becoming prostitutes. Guo concluded by saying: "Now that the Northeast has been liberated, the Kuomintang reactionaries have sent hundreds of thousands of troops to 'receive sovereignty' and still want to stand on the heads of the Northeast people to enslave them again. But today's Northeast people are no longer the Northeast people of fourteen years ago! The Northeast people have the determination and confidence to defend the fruits of victory won with blood and sweat. The Northeast people will fight the Kuomintang reactionaries to the end!" Note: General Guo Weicheng is from Zhendong County, Nenjiang Province. He served as confidential secretary and director of the political department to General Zhang Xueliang. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as Secretary-General of the Lu Su Provincial Government and Deputy Commander of the 111th Division. After "August 15th" last year, he returned to the Northeast and served as Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Nenjiang Province, Director of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau, and Commander of the Railway Protection Army. In June, he was elected as Chairman of the Qiqihar Provisional Consultative Conference and a member of the Nenjiang Provincial Government. Recently, he was appointed as the Commander of the West Manchuria Railway of the Democratic Allied Army.

　　郭维城将军播讲
　  控诉国民党反动派出卖东北人民罪行
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十五日电】（迟到）前任张学良将军机要秘书东北军一百一十师师长郭维城将军，顷于“八一五”前夜在此间新华广播电台发表演说，控诉国民党反动派十四年前出卖东北人民之罪行。郭氏称：“九一八”事变当时，张学良将军在北平一夜之间十几次电南京蒋介石请示，而蒋介石却十几次复电不准抵抗，叫把枪收起来，把仓库锁起来，一律点交日军。这些电文一直到现在还保存着，蒋介石是无法抵赖的。郭氏继以沉痛语调叙述东北同胞流亡关内被压迫岐视之惨状称：“九一八”事变，几千万东北同胞含着泪抱着满腔热情，希望得到政府的支持，早日打回东北来，而结果流亡在关内同胞却被国民党反动派斥为“亡国奴”，三十万东北军始而被投入反共战争，终于完全被分化瓦解与消灭。我们要问蒋介石：究竟张学良将军、黄显声师长爱国抗日有什么罪，一直到现在还被捕押？爱国军人王以哲军长、高福源旅长又为什么要被置之死地？一切爱国的进步东北人民都成了蒋介石的眼中钉，复兴社秘书长鲁苏战区政治部主任周××（电文不清）甚至向于学忠将军说：“东北军人都是国家民族的罪人，杀掉一个少一个。”流亡在关内的东北军人，在国民党反动派排斥异己政策下，死的死了，没有死的差不多都失了业，一些中下级军官的家属无人过问，以致老少流为乞丐，妇女沦为娼妓。郭氏最后说：“现在东北解放了，国民党反动派开来几十万军队接收主权，还想再来站在东北人民头上奴役东北人民，可是今天的东北人民已经不是十四年前的东北人民了！东北人民有决心和信心来保卫用血汗换来的胜利果实，东北人民将同国民党反动派奋斗到底！”按：郭维城将军系嫩江省镇东县人，曾任张学良将军机要秘书、政治处长，抗战后任鲁苏省府秘书长、一百十一师副师长，去年“八一五”后回东北，曾任嫩江省民政厅长、齐齐哈尔铁路局局长兼护路军司令员等职。六月间，被选为齐市临参会议长及嫩江省政府委员，最近又被任为民主联军西满铁路司令。
