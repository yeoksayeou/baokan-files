Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: At noon on the 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft bombed Yan'an headquarters. At about 12 o'clock, six "P47" fighter planes and one "B24" bomber intruded into the airspace over Yan'an City from the southeast, strafing the suburbs for more than 20 minutes, firing more than 10,000 machine gun bullets. Immediately afterwards, they flew to a place about 500 meters away from the Wangjiaping Yan'an headquarters and dropped 11 bombs. Fragments of bombs and shell casings were found, and it was confirmed that the bombs were American-made deep-penetration bombs, and the bullets were American-made "BM43" machine gun bullets of about half an inch in diameter. Captain Liu Shanben, who flew a "B24" aircraft to Yan'an against the civil war, was also hit and burned. After the incident, U.S. military observers Lieutenant Colonel Yang and Major Boertuo drove to the bombed and strafed area for inspection. Yan'an City was first bombed by Japanese aircraft on December 20, 1938, and was bombed many times until the last bombing in 1941. It has not been attacked by air since then. Today, the invaders have been surrendering for almost a year, and Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft have come to wreak havoc. People from all walks of life in Yan'an are extremely indignant.

This newspaper, Heze, 1st: On the 13th of last month, two Kuomintang bombers from Jinan, in response to the Kuomintang army in Xuzhou attacking the Peixian and Fengxian liberated areas north of our Longhai Railway, suddenly bombed Jining City, the central city of our Jilu-Yu liberated area, at 11 am that day. A total of eight bombs were dropped, and low-altitude strafing lasted for one hour. The Jining City Bus Station and part of the Jining Daily Office were destroyed. In addition to material losses, eight people were seriously injured.

Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 2nd: Zhang Huatang's troops of the Chiang army stationed in Cangxian County and the puppet troops of Li Jingwen and Wang Yongsheng dug up the river embankment on the 23rd of last month, taking advantage of the rising tide of the Jiedi River, causing breaches everywhere. Starting from Lujiaqiao, more than 30 miles north of Huangtu County (formerly Xinhua County), the flood rolled southward, with a water volume of about 50 miles and a length of more than 100 miles. Within two days, 54 villages in Cangxian and Huanghua counties in the liberated area were turned into swamps. More than 1,000 hectares of fertile land were flooded, houses collapsed, livestock were washed away, and the autumn crops that the people had worked hard to plant, which were about to be harvested, were now all in vain. The masses in the disaster area are extremely heartbroken and have sent representatives to the Eighth Route Army驻地 to demand the disbandment of the puppet army and the severe punishment of the culprit Zhang Huatang.

　　蒋机肆虐延安济宁各界人士万分愤慨
    【新华社延安二日电】二日中午，蒋介石飞机轰炸延安总部，十二时许，“Ｐ４７”式驱逐机六架，“Ｂ２４”式轰炸机一架，自东南方向窜入延安市上空，扫射城郊，达二十余分钟，发射机枪子弹万余发。旋即飞至离王家坪延安总部所在地约五百米处投弹十一枚。拾获炸弹片及子弹弹壳，查明炸弹为美制深入延性式炸弹，子弹为约半英寸口径大小的美制“ＢＭ４３”号机关枪弹。在扫射与轰炸中，刘善本上尉为反内战驾驶来延的“Ｂ２４”飞机一架，亦中弹焚毁。事后美军观察组杨中校与勃尔脱少校曾驾车至被轰炸扫射地点视察。按延安市于一九三八年十二月二十日第一次遭日机轰炸后，陆续被炸多次，至四一年最后一次被炸后，即未再遭空袭，今日寇投降将届一年，而蒋机竟来肆虐。延安各界人士，莫不愤慨万分。
    【本报荷泽一日电】上月十三日，济南国民党轰炸机两架，为呼应徐州国民党军向我陇海线北沛县、丰县解放区进攻，于该日上午十一时突轰炸我冀鲁豫解放区中心城市济宁市，计投弹八枚，低空扫射历一小时，济宁市汽车站及济宁日报社一部均被炸毁，除物资损失外，群众八人受重伤。
    【新华社惠民二日电】驻沧县城蒋军张华堂部及伪军李景文、王永升等部，于上月二十三日乘捷地河水势飞涨之际，竟挖开河堤，决口四处，自黄土县（原新海县）北三十余里吕家桥起，洪流滚滚南下，水量约五十余里，长达百余里，两日内解放区沧县、黄骅两县已有五十四个村庄沦为泽国，良田千余顷遭淹没，房屋倾塌，牲畜被冲走，人民辛勤种植之秋禾，眼见即可丰收，而今悉成泡影。灾区群众极为痛心，纷纷推派代表至八路军驻地，要求解散伪军严惩祸首张华堂。
