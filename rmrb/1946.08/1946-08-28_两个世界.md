　　Two Worlds
    Wang Yaping
    The Kuomintang-controlled areas and our liberated areas, ostensibly both under the same blue sky of China, have formed two worlds in terms of politics, military affairs, economics, culture, education, and people's lives. I have just stepped into this free place, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area, where the masses are rising up. Naturally, I have not seen or heard much, and my understanding is limited, so I cannot offer profound impressions. However, just based on my shallow observations and a comparison with the poor and filthy Kuomintang-controlled areas, one immediately feels the contrast between the two worlds, creating two different forces: one is vigorously rising, while the other is declining. This time, I left Chongqing—that garbage city—went through the Three Gorges, passing through Yichang, Shashi, Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, and then to Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, before returning here. I traveled through most of the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and the impression it left on me is that the countryside is filled with disasters, hunger, disease, and death. The broad masses of the people auction off their eggs, chickens, ducks, cotton yarn, crops, and even their blood, sweat, and lives, but still cannot get enough to eat. As a result, some eat all the grass roots and tree bark and starve to death, while others flee to the cities in groups. Women become hired laborers, helping people cook and wash clothes, while men are dragged away by the Kuomintang army, forced to dig trenches and build碉堡 [diaobao, pillboxes] in preparation for the civil war. What about the cities? They are filled with terror, theft, debauchery, and corruption. Prices rise wildly without end, business is sluggish, factories close down, workers are unemployed, and American goods flood the market. Those with money become wealthier, living a "Americanized" and "scientific" life, while the majority of citizens head towards death under hunger and hardship. An old man once told me with emotion, "Now it is a world of ghosts, not a world of people, it is not as good as the Qing Dynasty." This is the Kuomintang-controlled area in the mouths of the people. In such a dark area, I fought hard for eight years. I longed for the day I could dedicate myself to the liberated area, to study, to fight, and to dedicate everything to the cause of people's liberation. When I first stepped into this green and youthful land, I saw majestic militiamen, carrying guns and walking on the main roads beside the growing fields. From their expressions, you could tell that they had the courage and confidence to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army to defend the liberated land. Rural women are spinning and doing women's work, while men are working in the fields and learning to shoot. The merchants in the cities are all living in peace and working happily. Here, military, government, cultural, and educational personnel all wear the same coarse cloth clothes as the people, eat the same simple food, and walk all over the streets without finding a single gorgeously dressed figure. Even someone as shabbily dressed as me, wearing only a starlight shirt and a pair of Chinese gabardine pants, would be considered strange in the eyes of the people, which made me feel very ashamed. Prices in the market are five times cheaper than in Chongqing and ten times cheaper than in Nanjing and Shanghai. Walking through the stores, I couldn't find a single trace of foreign goods, which made me feel that this was a real place for Chinese people. I heard that the people here are carrying out a great turnaround movement, and they have already settled the blood debts owed to the people by landlords, traitors, and war criminals. It is a pity that I have not yet seen these great and magnificent scenes with my own eyes. The cultural and educational work here is also actively promoted in coordination with this "great turnaround" movement. Although it is only preliminary sowing work, it will surely sprout, grow leaves, bloom, and bear fruit. I really want to congratulate myself for stepping from a corrupt, dark, and terrifying zone into this newly born, bright, and free zone. "The people will transform history." Today, this sentence has been better proven in the facts I have seen.

　　两个世界
    王亚平
    国民党的统治地区和我们解放区，按说同样在中国的蓝色天空下面，但无论从政治、军事、经济、文化、教育以及人民生活任何方面来看，都形成了两个世界。我是刚刚踏进了这一块自由的地方，人民群众正在翻身起来的冀鲁豫解放区，自然看到的听到的不多，认识的不多，不能说出深刻的印象，但只就我实浅的观感和那贫困的龌龊的国民党统治地区一作比较，就立刻叫人感到两个世界的对比，造成了两种不同的力量，一边正在蓬勃的上升，一边正在没落下降。这次我离开重庆——那个垃圾都市，出三峡、经宜昌、沙市、汉口、九江、芜湖、到了京、沪、杭州，再折回又到了这里，把国民党统治的地区走了一个大半，它给我的印象，是乡村里走满了灾害，饥饿、疾病、死亡，广大人民把自己的鸡蛋、鸡、鸭、棉线、农作物、甚至血汗、生命，都拍卖了贡献出来，还得不到温饱，于是有的把草根树皮吃尽了，就活活的饿死，有的成群的流亡到都市，女的充雇工，帮人烧饭、洗衣服，男的被国民党的军队拉走，迫使他们挖战沟、筑碉堡，准备打内战。都市里呢？充满了恐怖、偷盗、荒淫、贪污，物价无止境的狂涨，商场萧条，工厂倒闭，工人失业，美国货充斥于市场，有钱的越有钱，过着“美国化”，“科学人”的生活，大多数市民则在饥寒困苦下走向死亡，一个老百姓曾感慨地告诉我说：“现在是鬼世界，不是人世界，还不如清朝好。”这就是人民口中的国民党统治地区。在那样黑暗的地区，我坚苦地抗斗了八年，我渴望有一天投身到解放区，学习、战斗，把一切献给人民解放事业，当我第一天踏进这样绿色的青春的土地，我就看见了雄壮的民兵，背着枪走在田禾生长的地边大路上，从他们的神色上可以告诉你，他们有勇气有信心协同八路军保卫解放的土地。乡村的妇女在纺织做女工，男子们出力下田学习打枪，城市里的商民，都安居乐业，喜形于色的生活着，在这里军政文教人员都和人民穿一样的粗布衣裳，吃一样的粗陋饮食，走遍四条大街，找不到一个衣装华丽的人物，就像我这个衣着最蹩脚的人，只穿一件星光衬衫，一条中国哔叽裤子，在老百姓眼睛里，能够奇异了，这叫我感到十分惭愧。街市上物价比重庆便宜五倍，比京沪便宜十倍，走遍各家商店找不到一星星洋货，使我感到这才是真正的中国人的地方。听说这里的人民正做着大翻身运动，他们业已清算了地主、汉奸、战争罪犯欠下人民的血债，可惜这些伟大壮烈的场面，我还没有亲眼看到。这里的文化教育工作也正配合这个“大翻身”运动，积极地推进开展着，虽然还只是初步的播种工作，但它一定会生芽，长叶，开花结实的。我真要为自己庆幸，我从一个腐败的，黑暗的，恐怖的地带，走进了这个新生的，光明的，自由的地带。“人民会改造历史的”，今天这句话更在我所看到的事实中得到更好的证明了。
