The Seventeenth Division Organizes a慰问团 to Comfort Uprising Officers and Soldiers in Huixian County
[This Dispatch from Handan] The 17th Division of the Army organized a 慰问团 (comfort group) on the 15th, carrying numerous慰问 flags and letters of慰问, to comfort Company Commanders Xue, Lü, and Ding of the 177th Division, who led their troops in an uprising against Chiang Kai-shek's policy of selling out the country and starting a civil war. They went to the stationed locations of Company Commander Xue and others to express their慰问 to Company Commanders Xue, Lü, and Ding and all the officers and soldiers. The慰问 letters from the 17th Division Commander Zhang Fuzhen, Liu Weicheng, and Liang Lisheng stated: "We deeply admire you for leading your troops in a glorious uprising against selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war. Peace and democracy are the common path for the whole world and China, as well as for all patriotic troops and soldiers in the country. The general trend and the will of the people dictate that those who support peace and democracy will surely win, and those who insist on selling out the country and dictatorship will surely fail. Your courageous act is a bright future for the troops forced into a civil war of selling out the country today. Especially our Northwest Army, which has always strived for democracy, freedom, and peace for the people, we are willing to continue our efforts alongside you company commanders and all officers and soldiers to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of our Northwest Army and strive for the complete victory of the cause of independence, peace, and democracy." The慰问 flag from the headquarters and political department of the division read: "Your righteous act is a model for patriotic troops and the glory of the people of the Northwest" and "You have fulfilled the people's wishes and struck a blow to the reactionary clique's conspiracy of selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war. A glorious uprising. We are willing to work together to strive for independence, peace, and democracy." The慰问 letter from all the officers and soldiers of the Chen Regiment, in addition to expressing sincere慰问 and respect to the officers and soldiers who carried out the glorious uprising, also recounted the Northwest Army's resistance against Japan: "We fought side by side in Zhongtiao Mountain, Rong(yang), Guang(wu), Si(shui), and various places in western Henan, fiercely attacking the enemy, supporting each other, and cooperating with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which persisted in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines, defeating the Japanese invaders' ambition to destroy China. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries not only did not reward our merits but instead implemented their consistent policy of annexing miscellaneous troops... Your foresight saw through their reactionary conspiracy and resolutely raised the banner of uprising, which is worthy of admiration and praise from the people of the whole country, the people of the Northwest, and the 140 million people in the liberated areas. We hope that you and we will work together under the leadership of the democratic government in the liberated areas and strive to the end for China's independence, peace, and democracy." The other letters also recalled the dark and painful life in the reactionary army of Chiang Kai-shek, described the happiness of the bright and democratic liberated areas, and expressed their willingness to work together in the liberated areas for peace and democracy.
