　　【Further News】During this bloodbath, most of the militia of Nansu and Wangcun, as well as the Nansu militia captain Han Zhilu, the Wangcun Military Committee Director Yao Lianchun, and others, demonstrated the unparalleled heroic spirit of self-defense of the masses who had overturned their fate, resolutely resisting the invasion of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops. After the Wangcun militia and village cadres discovered that their houses were surrounded by the enemy (the sentry on the roof was leading the enemy in, by a local traitor, Yao Jinrui), Military Committee Director Yao Lianchun immediately led everyone to fight bravely against the enemy amidst the dense grenades and bullets, holding out for a long time, and then fought their way out of the encirclement with great effort. The enemy was trapped and never dared to enter the house. The enemy invading Nansu originally planned to capture Han Zhilu alive, but as soon as the enemy entered the village, the militia who were sleeping collectively were awakened by the sentry's horn. They immediately rushed out in two directions. The group led by Han Zhilu ran head-on into the enemy. When Han heard the enemy calling out his name, he immediately turned around and broke through the enemy's weak side. When Comrade Han Zhilu saw his family members being brutally murdered, he was not frightened or pessimistic, but became even more determined. Looking at the blood-stained corpses, he said sadly: "Kill! The more fiercely the reactionaries kill, the more resolute I will be! I swear to avenge you!" And he said to the militia: "In the future, we must work hard to learn military skills and fight to the end with those sons of bitches!"

　　翻身群众奋勇抗击蒋伪韩之禄姚连春杀出重围
    【又讯】在此次血案中，南苏、王村大部民兵及南苏民兵队长韩之禄、王村武委会主任姚连春等，都表现了翻身群众坚决抗击蒋伪军进犯的无比英勇自卫精神。王村民兵、村干部发觉住房被敌包围后（房上哨兵为本村特务姚金瑞所带敌人摸人），武委会主任姚连春立即领导大家在敌人浓密的手榴弹、枪弹中勇敢抗击、坚持良久，后奋力冲出重围，敌人困得始终未敢进房子。进犯南苏敌人原拟活捉韩之禄，但敌人刚一进村，集体睡觉的民兵们已被哨兵的号声惊醒，于是立即分两路冲出，韩之禄带的一路迎头碰上敌人，韩听见敌人高呼自己名字，立即掉转方向，从敌人薄弱的一面冲出去了。当韩之禄同志见到家人被惨杀后，他没有吓倒，也没有悲观，反而更加坚定起来。他看着血迹模糊的尸体沉痛的说：“杀吧，反动派杀得愈厉害我愈坚决！我誓死要为你们报仇！”并向民兵说：“以后咱们可要努力学习军事，非和狗肉的干到底不可！”
