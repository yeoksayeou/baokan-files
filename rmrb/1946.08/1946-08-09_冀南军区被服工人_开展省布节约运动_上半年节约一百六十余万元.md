　　Jinnan Military Region Clothing Workers
    Launch Cloth-Saving Campaign
    More Than 1.6 Million Yuan Saved in the First Half of the Year
    [This newspaper, Weixian News] The cloth-saving campaign launched by the clothing section workers of the Jinnan Military Region has achieved great results. The clothing section workers actively responded to the call of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region to "implement joint public-private management, 20-80 profit sharing, and launch a conservation campaign." They carefully studied clothing cutting techniques and put forward the slogan "Don't waste a single scrap of cloth." Initially, the goal of making large clothes while saving cloth was achieved. Each set of clothing saves more than one square foot of cloth, totaling 33,000 square feet of cloth (including 20,000 square feet of foreign cloth) saved in the first half of the year. Calculating based on the August market price of 50 yuan per square foot of plain coarse cloth, a total of 1.65 million yuan was saved. The public share was 1.48 million yuan, and the workers' share was 170,000 yuan. If calculated based on the saved foreign cloth, the amount would be even higher. After a recent summary, the workers' enthusiasm has increased further. Under the leadership and promotion of the General Labor Union, even greater achievements can be expected in the second half of the year.

　　冀南军区被服工人
    开展省布节约运动
    上半年节约一百六十余万元
    【本报威县讯】冀南军区被服科工人开展的省布节约运动，已获很大成绩。该科被服工人曾积极响应晋冀鲁豫军区“实行公私兼顾、二八分红、开展节约运动”的号召，细心研究裁衣技术，并提出“不浪费一块零布”的口号，初步达到了衣服大、省布匹的目的。每套衣服省布一方尺多，计上半年共节约布三万三千方尺（内洋布二万方尺）。如按八月份白粗布市价每方尺值洋五十元计算，共节约一百六十五万元。公家分红一百四十八万元，工人分红十七万元，如按所节省之洋布计算，尚不只此数。经过最近总结后，工人情绪更加高涨，在总工会领导推动下，后半年节约当能获得更大成绩。
