　　[Urgent Telegram from the Longhai Front, 22nd] The Chiang Army troops under Liu Ruming, Cao Fulin, Liu Ruzhen, and others, relying on their American-style light and heavy weapons and with air support, have been counterattacking our Yuedong Liberated Area in the Minquan area for days. A portion of our army immediately launched a self-defense counterattack against the invading troops in the Kongji, Luzhuang, and Denzhai areas between Shangqiu and Minquan. As a result of fierce fighting, at 10:00 PM on the 20th, our army captured Luzhuang between Minquan and Liuheji. Another unit also captured Denzhai Village, northwest of Ningling County, at the same time. In total, one engineering and one artillery company of the 181st Division of the Chiang Army were annihilated, and more than 400 people were forced to lay down their arms. Five mountain guns, three mortars, five heavy machine guns, ten light machine guns, and one radio station were captured. As of the moment before this telegram was sent, our army had completely annihilated the entire 181st Division of Mi Wenhe and one regiment of the 29th Division. Mi Wenhe himself only escaped in disguise with a few orderlies and followers.
　　[Our Newspaper, Handan, 24th] The Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region has sent a telegram to commend the soldiers and civilians on the Longhai Front who won the self-defense counterattack. The original telegram is as follows: To all corps, guerrilla units, combat heroes, and participating militia and self-defense team members on the Longhai Front:
　　In the past ten days, you have achieved brilliant victories in the self-defense campaign on the Longhai Front to defend the liberated areas, strive for peace, independence, and democracy, and smash the offensive of the Kuomintang reactionaries, especially on the 20th and 21st, annihilating one and a half divisions of the Chiang Army! We are extremely gratified! We hereby send our commendation and condolences! We hope that you will continue your efforts, fully expand the battle results, annihilate a large number of enemies, and thoroughly smash the offensive of the Kuomintang reactionaries!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　The Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region, August 22nd
