　　Preliminary Breakthrough in Mass Movement in the Suburbs of Linzhang
　　Combining Rent Reduction with Anti-Traitor Activities; Middle Peasants Participate in the Struggle, Expanding the Mass Ranks
　　[Report from Our Newspaper in Linzhang] The second rent reduction movement by farmers in the suburbs of Linzhang County is being carried out in conjunction with the anti-traitor liquidation campaign by the poor in the urban area, and has achieved a preliminary breakthrough. This spring, more than a hundred tenant farmers in villages around the city, such as Luocun, launched a struggle against the big landlord Wang Guide, recovering a season's worth of grain. However, because they did not vent the pain inflicted on them by the local tyrant who relied on enemy power, their thinking was not conscious enough, and some tenant farmers secretly returned the grain to the landlord afterwards, causing the movement to decline. Recently, the masses in the urban area launched an anti-traitor complaint movement. Influenced by this, tenant farmers in Luocun contacted more than a hundred tenant farmers in three villages and petitioned the government, demanding to settle accounts with the local tyrant Wang Guide and the traitor Wang Laobuzi. The leadership combined the anti-traitor campaign with rent reduction, and the masses' fighting spirit suddenly surged. In late last month, more than 6,000 tenant farmers from five villages around the city, united with poor people from nine villages in the urban area, launched a struggle against Wang Laobuzi, the first traitor in Linzhang to surrender to the enemy, and the big landlord Wang Guide. At the meeting, more than 20 people accused the traitor Wang Laobuzi of offering the silver and grain ledgers to the enemy with both hands after the Japanese occupied Linzhang, betraying the people of the entire county, and conspiring with the local tyrant Wang Guide to allocate money and grain specifically meant for the poor. Impartial gentry from the urban area questioned Wang Laobuzi,责备责备 criticizing him for handing over the silver and grain stubs to the enemy.
　　The masses were even more resentful of the local tyrant Wang Guide. An old lady, holding a medicine pot, complained in public, scolding Wang Guide for seizing eighteen mu of her family's good land through high-interest loans, making her family live in misery, and even now she still needs her medicine pot. The masses complained one after another. Faced with the masses' righteous accusations, the traitor and local tyrant bowed their heads and confessed their guilt. A liquidation committee was formed at the meeting, and according to law, it liquidated 720 mu of land, 18 cotton gins, 42 poplar trees, 110,000 yuan of flower business money, and two courtyards.
　　[Another Report] After the liberation of Linzhang, there was a rent reduction and grain recovery movement in the urban area. Only about 20 tenant farmer families in the entire city achieved victory. The vast majority of urban poor people were excluded from the tenant farmer movement, and the traitors and local tyrants remained at large, not having been eliminated. In order to break through this narrow circle of the tenant farmer movement, the leadership paid attention to taking care of the interests of the middle peasants in the recent liquidation struggle against the local tyrant Yang Zaitian in the southeast corner of the city. One middle peasant who had served as a 保长 (baozhang) and running dog was willing to repent to the masses. The leadership immediately mobilized the masses to discuss the matter. After he thoroughly confessed, not only was he not punished, but he was also greatly encouraged. Seeing this situation, some middle peasants' morale suddenly soared. When complaining about the local tyrant Yang Zaitian, 16 middle peasant households immediately participated. Out of more than 60 households in the entire street, 40 to 50 households spoke. The ranks of the masses grew, and the local tyrant had no choice but to bow his head to the masses. This time, a total of 1,200 jin of cotton batting and 250,000 yuan were seized from Yang Zaitian's embezzlement. The victory of the struggle in the southeast corner of the city prompted the masses in the four gates and nine villages to rise up and complain, accusing the traitor 保长 (baozhang) of forcing the masses to tear off their cotton batting during the famine years to supply the enemy, forming a mass anti-traitor liquidation movement.

　　临漳城郊群运初步打开局面
    减租与反奸结合进行   
    中农参加斗争群众阵容壮大
    【本报临漳讯】本县城郊农民第二次减租运动与城关贫民反奸清算结合进行，已初步打开局面。今年春天，城周洛村等地百余佃户曾向大地主王贵德发动过一次斗争，倒回一季粮食，但因没有吐出恶霸地主依仗敌势给予自己的痛苦，思想上未能自觉，事后有部分雇佃又把粮食悄悄给地主送回去，运动陷入消沉。最近城关群众反奸诉苦运动起来了，洛村佃户在他影响下，串联了三个村的百余佃户向政府请愿，要求和恶霸地主王贵德和汉奸王老步子算账，领导上把反奸与减租结合起来，群众斗争情绪突趋高涨。上月下旬城周五村雇佃联合城关九村贫民六千余人，向临漳第一个投敌汉奸王老步子及大地主王贵德展开斗争，会上有二十余人控诉汉奸王老步子在日本侵占临漳后，把银粮簿子双手拱献给敌人，出卖全县人民，并与恶霸地主王贵德合谋，把钱粮专拨在穷人身上的罪恶。城关公正士绅向王老步子提出质问，责备他不该把银粮存根拱送敌人。
    对于恶霸地主王贵德，群众更加愤恨。一位老太太拿着药罐子当众诉苦，痛骂王贵德用大利钱夺去了她家十八亩好地，弄得她一家人气的死去活来，直到如今药罐子还不离身。群众纷纷诉苦，汉奸恶霸在群众的正义控诉之前低头服罪，一个清算委员会在大会上产生了，依法清算出土地七百二十亩，轧花车十八辆，杨树四十二棵，花行钱十一万元，院二座。
    【又讯】临漳解放后，城关曾经过一度减租倒粮运动。全城只二十余家佃户得到胜利果实，广大城市贫民关在雇佃运动之外，汉奸恶霸仍逍遥法外未能清除，领导上为冲破这个雇佃运动的狭小圈子，乃在日前东南城角反恶霸杨在田的清算斗争中注意照顾中农利益，有一家中农当过保长狗腿，愿意向群众悔过，领导上当即发动群众讨论，在他彻底坦白后，不但没有处罚他，而且给了他很大鼓励。一些中农看见这种情形，情绪顿然高涨，在向恶霸杨在田诉苦时，马上有十六户中农参加，全街六十余户有四五十户发言，群众的阵容壮大了，恶霸不得不向群众低头，这一次共清算出杨在田贪污的一千二百斤棉花套子和二十五万块钱。东南城角斗争胜利，推动四关九个村群众，纷纷起来诉苦，控诉汉奸保长灾荒年间逼迫群众撕下棉套供给敌人的罪行，形成了群众性反奸清算运动。（冰如）
