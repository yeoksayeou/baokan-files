　　Zhangyuan Tobacco Factory Becomes a Children's Paradise
　　[Zhangjiakou, 9th Dispatch] The Zhangyuan Tobacco Company's factory workshops have become a paradise for over a hundred child laborers. Since October of last year, the factory has implemented a six-hour workday for child laborers. Under the principle of equal pay for equal work, wages have more than doubled compared to the enemy puppet regime. The factory has also helped them organize welfare organizations such as child labor schools and clubs. This summer, considering that the family lives of many child laborers have improved and they no longer need to rely on their children's labor to make a living, the factory conducted a thorough investigation and consulted with the parents of the child laborers. It was decided to help six child laborers under the age of fifteen to completely leave work and go to school to study. For child laborers from families with relatively difficult economic situations, the factory recruited their older siblings to replace them at work, allowing them to take some time off to study. Forty-nine child laborers have implemented a part-work, part-study system. The expenses and stationery for the child laborers' half-day school are all covered by the factory. The curriculum includes Chinese language, arithmetic, general knowledge, and song lyrics. Child laborers from families with economic difficulties still receive full wages. In addition, child laborers who are over sixteen years old and in good physical condition still work six hours. The public factory's considerate care and responsible attitude towards child laborers have made all parents very happy and moved.

　　张垣烟草工厂成为童工乐园
　  【张家口九日电】张垣烟草公司，工厂机器间已成为一百多个童工的乐园。自去年十月份以来，该厂童工即已实行六小时劳动制，在同工同酬原则下，工资较敌伪统治时增加一倍有余，厂方并帮助他们举办了童工学校、俱乐部等福利组织。今夏厂方鉴于许多童工的家庭生活已经改善，不需要再依靠自己子弟做工维持生计，经过缜密调查并与童工家长商洽后，决定帮助六个十五岁以下的童工完全退工，送到学校里去学习。个别家庭经济比较困难的童工，厂方吸收他们的哥姐来代替他们做工，使其可以抽出一部分时间学习。有四十九个童工实行了半工半读制。童工半日学校的经费、文具等，全部由厂方解决。课程有国语、算术、常识、歌词等。家庭经济困难的童工，仍发予全工资。另外，年龄在十六岁以上发育状况很好的童工，仍担负六小时劳动。公家厂方对童工这种体贴关心及负责的态度，各家长都很高兴感动。
