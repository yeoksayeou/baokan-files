　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 21st—The editorial in the *Yan'an Liberation Daily* on the 18th, calling for "All liberated areas to mobilize and crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive," has already met with action here. Xiao Ming, Director of the Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions, told reporters: In order to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, a vigorous movement to practice economy, increase production, and support the front lines has been widely launched among the more than 20,000 workers in Zhangjiakou. Workers in various factories and industries are voluntarily requesting to contribute labor and funds to慰劳 the Eighth Route Army commanders and fighters who are fighting bloody battles on the front lines. The Federation of Trade Unions has received more than 56.4 million yuan in donations from 16 factories, water carriers in the 6th district, shop assistants in the 2nd district, and others. Wang Zhenquan, a worker at the Xuanhua Xinhua Machine Factory, achieved the outstanding result of completing 52 hours of production tasks in 36 hours. Workers at the Jianguo Smelting Factory are voluntarily processing for one hour every day. Comrades such as Wang Fengshan and Feng Lianheng have all done five hours of work in one hour. The call in the editorial to "pay close attention to developing people's power and pay close attention to thrift" has attracted the attention of all cadres of the Border Region Administrative Committee. A unanimous resolution has now been made to save one or two liang of millet per person per day to aid the front lines, and to reduce financial expenditures through savings in various aspects. The document section plans to use accumulated waste paper for more than three months, which can save one million yuan. The Finance Department has decided not to collect paper and stationery within half a year, and will immediately launch a movement to clean up materials in various departments. Mr. Hong Ziliang, a Zhangjiakou city councilor and famous doctor, has suggested to the government that he is willing to voluntarily train rescue personnel. Major public hospitals in Xuanhua City have prepared the first batch of more than 500 beds to serve the self-defense war. Mr. Yun Ziqiang, a councilor from the Zhangjiakou education sector, suggested that current primary and secondary schools in Zhangjiakou should appropriately strengthen anti-fascist education, improve students' and the broad masses' understanding of the self-defense war, and cooperate in carrying out various wartime services in the rear. Party, government, military, and civilians from all walks of life in Chahar Province have jointly established a Self-Defense War Mobilization Committee, and decided to carry out in-depth self-defense war mobilization throughout the province, strengthen anti-espionage and air defense work, consolidate the rear area's public security, practice economy, eliminate all waste and extravagance, and fully support the front lines. More than 1,000 citizens in Xuanhua's streets and cities have organized a public security patrol brigade to assist the military and police in air defense and anti-espionage.
