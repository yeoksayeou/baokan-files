(Huaiyin, 9th) A surge of support for the army and the front lines is sweeping through Jiangsu and Anhui. Various agencies and organizations in the border region established慰劳(comfort) committees in late last month. Organized慰劳(comfort) groups went to the front lines to慰劳(comfort) the self-defense soldiers. The Experimental Theater Troupe, under the auspices of the Chinese Cultural Association, is touring the war zone. The Border Region Government donated 500,000 yuan (equivalent to 8,000,000 legal currency) to慰劳(comfort) the troops. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Huai'an City Federation of Trade Unions, the textile industry, and Huaqun Tobacco Company, representing more than 200 people, organized a large慰劳(comfort) team, carrying food, watermelons, eggs, and other gifts to慰劳(comfort) the troops in a certain area. Countless people along the way spontaneously joined the effort. More than 1,000 people from Wuhedui organized a慰劳(comfort) group procession that stretched for miles, with banners flying and drums and gongs sounding, in a highly spirited mood. Workers at the Political Department Printing Factory of the Central China Military Region donated more than 21,000 yuan in wages (equivalent to more than 300,000 legal currency) in one day to慰劳(comfort) the troops, and sent letters to the commanders and fighters at the front, vowing to resolutely defend themselves and demonstrate a high degree of work initiative to support the front. People everywhere are particularly enthusiastic about rescuing the wounded. In a certain area on the Central Jiangsu front, a stretcher team led by Wang Guangsheng braved artillery fire to cross the river to rescue the wounded. Fearing that the river water would be harmful to the wounds, they carried the wounded on their backs and climbed down from a bridge. The Li family of three in Huoxian ×× town all rushed to serve the wounded soldiers. Their mother said, "They were wounded for us, if we don't serve them, who will?" All teachers and students of the Central China Medical College requested to participate in the work of the field hospital. When the wounded were transported from the front to a certain place in the rear, the cultural association, teachers, students, and people from all walks of life in various departments of the military region went to慰问(express sympathy) and care for them, vying to set up beds, hang curtains, bathe, wash clothes, and provide nutritious food. Cadres of the Central China Bureau of the CPC heard that the wounded soldiers lacked beds and immediately gave up 150 beds, willing to sleep on the floor themselves. Deputy Director Zhao of the Propaganda Department and Deputy Director Liu of the Political Department personally bathed the wounded soldiers. Soldier Zhou Guizhang was unable to lean on the bed because his leg was injured by an explosion. Wang Youping and two other members of the art troupe took turns supporting him all night, and their hands were swollen. But they said, "We don't feel tired, we only deeply appreciate the joy of serving our brothers." From the president to every staff member of the hospital, they are working day and night. The wounded soldiers happily said: "There is a saying that 'a long illness has no filial son.' We now have too many 'filial sons.' Under everyone's loving care, we only feel honored and forget the pain. Because we are in good spirits, our wounds will heal quickly."

    热烈劳军支援前线
　　【淮阴九日电】苏皖各地掀起劳军与支持前线的热潮。边区各机关团体于上月下旬先后成立慰劳委员会，组织慰劳团分赴各前线慰劳自卫将士。华中文协主持之实验剧团前往战地作巡回公演。边区政府捐款五十万元（合法币八百万元）劳军。华中总工联、淮安市工联、纺织业、华群烟草公司等，代表二百余人组织慰劳大队，携带食品，西瓜、鸡蛋等礼物至某地劳军，沿途无数群众临时自动参加。五河堆市民一千余人，组织之慰劳团行列长达里许，锦旗飘扬，锣鼓喧天，情绪极为昂奋。华中军区政治部印刷厂工友，一天中捐献工资二万一千余元（合三十余万元法币）劳军，并致函前线指战员誓以竭力自卫决心与发挥高度工作积极性支援前线。各地人民对于救护伤员尤为热烈。苏中前线某地王广生领头的一组担架队，冒着炮火渡河去抢救伤员，因怕河水对伤口不利，背着伤员从＠桥上爬下。火线××镇李姓一家三人，全都赶去服侍伤兵。其母亲说：“他们为我们受伤，我们不服侍谁去服侍？”华中医科学，校师生全体请求参加野战医院工作。当伤员由前线运到后方某地时，军区各部门文协、教员、学生及各界群众均纷纷前往慰问看护，争着为他们搭床铺、挂帐子、洗澡、洗衣服，供应富有营养的食物。中共华中分局干部听说伤兵同志缺乏床铺，立即让出床铺一百五十张，情愿自己睡地板。宣教部赵副部长、政治处刘副主任都亲自给伤兵洗澡。伤兵周贵章因腿被炸伤了不能靠床，文工团王幼萍等三人轮流为他扶了一整夜，手都扶肿了。但他们说：“并不感到疲倦，只深深体味到为自己的弟兄服务的愉快”。医院上自院长下至每个工作人员，都是不分昼夜地工作着。伤兵们高兴的说：“俗语说‘久病床头无孝子。’我们现在是‘孝子’太多了。在大家友爱照护之下只感到光荣，忘记了病苦。因为精神愉快，伤口很快就会痊愈的。”
