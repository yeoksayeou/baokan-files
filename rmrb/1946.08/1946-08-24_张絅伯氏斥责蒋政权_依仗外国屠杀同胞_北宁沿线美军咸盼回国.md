Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Shanghai dispatch: Mr. Zhang Junbo, a director of the Shanghai People's Delegation for Peace Appeal to the Capital and director of the Zhongyu Industrial Company, published an article in the Wenhui Daily on August 1st, pointing out: "The Kuomintang authorities rely on foreign military supplies to maintain their 'orthodoxy' and vainly attempt to eliminate the CCP within eight weeks. This is just the dream of warmongers." Mr. Zhang said, "The people are not afraid of death, so how can they be frightened by death?! When the people are not afraid of death, let alone guns and cannons, even atomic bombs cannot scare people... They only end up ruining their appetite and being unable to live in peace." Mr. Zhang said, "The Kuomintang authorities regard the people as conquered prisoners, openly extorting and swindling, and selectively devouring the fat, making everyone gnash their teeth. In addition, they have suppressed democratic publications and assassinated democratic fighters, reaching the point of political corruption, incompetence, chaos, darkness, where superiors lack moral principles and subordinates lack moral integrity."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: US News Agency, New York, 15th: Walter Lippmann, a special correspondent for the New York Times, wrote an article in the Times' Sunday Trends supplement entitled "Madame Sun, the Conscience of China," stating: Many people regard Madame Sun as "China's First Lady," and say that "Madame Sun is known for her faithful adherence to the opinions and ideals of her late husband, Mr. Sun Yat-sen. She tirelessly and courageously strives to realize Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. The recent statement issued by the Madame is an example of her strict adherence to independence. Madame recently decided to retire and concentrate her efforts on relief work, which makes her statement even more shocking. Madame feels that the Kuomintang, founded by Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime, has failed to fulfill its obligations. Madame Sun is indeed a left-wing democrat, but not a communist. She is the first believer in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's party principles, and believes in thorough land reform and a coalition government with the Communist Party and other parties as the current remedy for China."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: TASS News Agency, New York, 20th: The New York Times correspondent in Tianjin, Mr. Weil, reported: He traveled for three days on a 160-mile section of the Beining Railway and is convinced that American Marines, from senior officers to lower-ranking soldiers, are equally willing to withdraw from China and do not understand why they are staying in China. Although the Marines are still effectively performing their duties, all Marines express their disgust with the Chiang Kai-shek government and sympathize with the CCP. The Marines are not communists, but they believe that any change can improve China's situation and that the CCP's participation in the government can stimulate industrial recovery and eliminate the danger of civil war.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to United Press, Washington, 16th: The US Army Department announced that the United States has no intention of withdrawing US troops stationed in China at present. Also, the US News Agency, Shanghai, 17th: The first batch of family members of US military personnel stationed in China will depart from Seattle on the Answorth on September 3rd to come to China.

　　张絅伯氏斥责蒋政权
　　依仗外国屠杀同胞
    北宁沿线美军咸盼回国
    【新华社延安十九日电】沪讯：上海人民赴京吁和代表之一中与实业公司董事张絅伯氏，在八月一日文汇报发表论文，指出：“国民党当局依靠外国军火维持其‘正统’，妄图在八星期之内消灭中共，这只是好战分子的梦想。”张氏说：“民不畏死，奈何以死惧之？！等到人民不怕死，不用说枪炮，即用原子炸弹也不能吓人…………自己反弄得饮食俱废，不可终日。”张氏说：“国民党当局视人民为被征服的俘虏，明敲暗诈，择肥而噬，使得人人切齿。加以摧残民主刊物，暗杀民主战士，已经到了政治贪污、低能、混乱、黑暗、上无道揆，下无德守的地步。”
    【新华社延安二十一日电】美新闻处纽约十五日讯：纽约时报特派员李普曼，在时报星期潮流专刊中撰文，题为“孙夫人中国之良心”，略称：不少人认为孙夫人为“中国之第一夫人”，并谓“孙夫人以忠实坚守其先夫孙中山先生之意见与理想著称。夫人不辞劳苦，勇敢奋斗，以求实现中山先生之三民主义。夫人最近发表之声明，为其严守独立之例子。夫人不久前曾决定退休，而集中力量于救济工作，因此她所发表之声明，更令人惊震。夫人感觉孙中山先生生前手创之国民党未能履行其义务。孙夫人诚为一左翼之民主党，但并非共产党。她为中山先生党义之第一个信徒，信仰彻底之土地改革及共产党与其他党派参加之联合政府作为目前中国之对症良药”。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：纽约时报驻天津记者威尔报导：他曾在北宁路一六○英里长的一段铁路上游历三日，深信美国海军陆战队自高级军官至下级士兵都同样愿意自中国撤退，而不了解他们为什么留在中国。虽然陆战队仍在有效的执行职务，但所有的陆战队员都表示厌恶蒋介石政府而同情中共。陆战队员并非共产党员，但他们认为任何改变都可以改善中国的情势，而且相信中共参加政府可以刺激工业之恢复，免除内战的危险。
    【新华社延安十九日电】据合众社华府十六日讯：美陆军部宣称：美国现尚无意撤回驻华美军。又美新闻处上海十七日讯：美驻华军人之第一批家属将于九月三日自西雅图乘安斯华斯号轮船起程来华。
