Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 31st -- After the liberation of Ningwu, the democratic government, accepting the demands of the masses, confiscated all of the more than 10,000 mu of land and 2,500 rooms of housing belonging to the extremely wicked traitors Nan Guixin, Zhao Tingying, and Yang Dayi, and distributed them without compensation to poor peasants for cultivation and residence. Nan Guixin was the economic manager for the Japanese in Shanxi, Zhao was the director of the puppet Shanxi Police Department, and Yang was the former puppet Ningwu County Chief, all of whom were famous traitors in Shanxi. This time, the families of martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, the families of cadres, those who made contributions to the War of Resistance, the masses who suffered the most, and tenant farmers enjoy priority in the distribution, which will enable twenty poor peasant households in Ningwu to turn over from poverty. In the seven villages of Mi Cha Zui, Zhou Jia Bao, Jiang Zhuang Zi, and Shi Ji in Ningwu, more than seventy-eight of the one hundred and seventy households have already received land. During the distribution of the traitorous property, the masses in each village conducted democratic discussions and decided on specific distribution methods. Zhao Maoquan, a tenant farmer in Mi Cha Zui, received 15 *qing* of traitorous land and five houses. The county government immediately issued land certificates and written contracts, making him so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. After Shan Yin Si Fen got five *qing* of good land, he said to everyone he met: "This time, we have bones with meat on them! As long as we increase production, we will definitely be able to turn ourselves over next year!" The families of martyrs in Shi Ji and other villages, such as Zhou Fushou and twenty-six other households, received more than one hundred *qing* of land. They actively organized labor exchange teams to weed and plow the land, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly increased. They all said: "Those who have made contributions are rewarded, and those who have done evil are punished. This is how the world is turned around!"

　　晋绥宁武没收汉奸田产
    分给贫苦农民耕种
    【新华社兴县卅一日电】宁武解放后，民主政府即接受群众要求，已将罪大恶极之卖国贼南桂馨、赵庭英、杨达一，土地一万余亩、房院二千五百余间全部没收，并无代价的分配给贫苦农民耕种与居住。按南桂馨为日本在山西之经济经理人，赵为伪山西警察所长，杨为前伪宁武县长，均属山西著名汉奸。此次分配贫困之抗属、干属死难烈士家属，抗战有功及受害最大之群众，以及雇佃贫农享有分配优先权，这将使宁武廿户贫苦农民从贫困中翻身。宁武之麋查咀、周家堡、姜庄子、石级等七个村庄一百七十户余居民中，已有七十八户贫苦佃户得到土地。分配逆产时，各村群众都进行了民主讨论，并决定具体分配办法。麋查咀佃户赵毛铨分得逆产地十五垧，房屋五间，县政府立即发给地证和文约，喜得它合不拢嘴。山银四分得了五垧好地以后，逢人便说：“这一下有了带肉的骨头，只要加油生产，明年就一定能翻身过来！”石级等村抗属，周福寿等二十六户，得地一百余垧，均积极组织变工、锄草、翻地，生产情绪大为提高，都说：“有功的得奖，恶害的得罚，这才把世界变过来啊！”
