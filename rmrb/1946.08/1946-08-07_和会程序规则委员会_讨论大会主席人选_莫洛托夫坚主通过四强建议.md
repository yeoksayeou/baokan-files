Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. Paris dispatch: The Rules Committee of the Peace Conference continued its meeting on the 3rd to discuss the candidates for the Chairman of the General Assembly. At the meeting, the Dutch representative withdrew his proposal to appoint Beel as the permanent chairman of the General Assembly, but put forward a new plan to select the chairman of the General Assembly from the chief representatives of the twenty-one countries, instead of just having the four powers rotate. Molotov warned the Netherlands against this move, saying that small countries should not attempt to overturn the decisions of the four powers, as this would inevitably cause panic and confusion in world opinion. Molotov stated that he would clearly oppose any attempt to change the decisions already passed by the four countries, especially the new plan of the Netherlands, and insisted that the committee pass the four-power recommendation, that is, Molotov, Byrnes, Attlee, and Beel should take turns as chairman. The Czechoslovak delegation requested the committee to accept the four-power decision to speed up the work, and said, "If we cannot agree on such a simple issue, then how will we solve bigger problems?" Beel also notified the Dutch representative on the evening of the 2nd that he would not accept the position of permanent chairman unless there was a unanimous vote. But he also proposed a method, that is, "the conference elects the chairman," so that the vast majority can control the election. After debate, the Dutch new plan was rejected by twelve votes (including the four powers, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia and Ukraine, etc.) to eight votes (one abstention). Supporters of the Netherlands included Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Belgium.
    Furthermore, the plenary session of the Peace Conference also continued on the 3rd, with representatives continuing to deliver speeches. The Ukrainian representative, Manuilsky, delivered a speech, warning against repeating the mistakes of 1919. He declared his readiness to support the proposal for the internationalization of Trieste and its neighboring areas, but believed that some consideration must be given. Sir Leonard, the chief representative of India, called for an end to "any form of colonial exploitation" in the former Italian East African and North African colonies. He called for the establishment of a "system leading to the earliest possible self-government of these peoples," saying that the true stability and security of North Africa and East Africa could only be guaranteed under this system.

    讨论大会主席人选
    莫洛托夫坚主通过四强建议
    【新华社延安四日电】巴黎讯：和会的程序规则委员会，于三日继续开会，讨论大会主席人选问题。会上荷兰代表撤回其建议比道尔任大会永久主席的提议，但又提出大会主席在二十一国首席代表中选出而非仅仅由四强轮流担任之新计划。莫洛托夫对荷兰此举提出警告称：小国切勿企图推翻四强的决定，因为这样势将在世界舆论中造成惊慌与混乱。莫洛托夫表示将明白反对任何欲变更四国所已通过的决定之企图，特别反对荷兰之新计划，并坚持主张该会通过四强建议，即由莫洛托夫、贝纳斯、艾德礼及比道尔轮流担任。捷克代表团要求该会接受四强决定，以加速工作，并称：“如果我们连这样简单的问题也不能协议，那末我们将怎样去解决更大的问题呢？”比道尔亦于二日晚通知荷兰代表，除非全体一致表决，将不接受永久主席之职。但他又提出一办法，即由“会议选举主席”，这样有绝大多数即可控制选举。经辩论后，以十二票（包括四强与波、捷、白俄罗斯与乌克兰等）对八票（一票弃权）否决荷兰新计划，支持荷兰者有墨西哥、澳大利亚、纽西兰及比利时。
    又讯：和会之全体大会在三日亦继续举行，仍为各代表相继发表演说。乌克兰代表曼努意斯基发表演说，警告不要重复一九一九年的错误，他宣称准备支持的里雅斯特及邻近地区国际化的建议，但认为必须予以某种考察。印度首席代表伦纳德爵士要求在前意属东菲及北菲殖民地中结束“任何形式的殖民地剥削”，他要求建立一种“引导至尽早允许这些民族自治的制度”，他说北菲与东菲的真正稳定与安全，只有在此制度下才有保证。
