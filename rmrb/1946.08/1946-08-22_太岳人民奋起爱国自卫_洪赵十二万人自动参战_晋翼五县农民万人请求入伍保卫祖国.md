【Yangcheng, 19th Dispatch】During our army's counter-offensive operations in Hong Zhao, 120,000 people were mobilized to participate in the patriotic war. Eight hundred stretchers from the two counties automatically rushed to the transportation station to assemble after the first shot was fired. Women from the mountains and valleys around the front line, over forty li, formed women's stretcher teams. In Zhuru Zhi Village alone, more than 300 women voluntarily participated. Various heroic model figures played a leading role in the self-defense war. Li Yugui, a labor hero from Fengli, led the villagers to make twelve springboards day and night during the city assault battle. Model teacher Li Kejian led his students and joined the labor school and the First High School to form a comfort team, permanently stationed in the hospital serving. All the carts and livestock in Hongdong County were mobilized, and the elderly excitedly drove the carts to deliver ammunition and dry food. More than sixty old men in the first district were grinding flour for the troops day and night on twenty-two water mills. Many villages set up colored sign transfer stations, which were managed by dedicated personnel, and women fed the colored signs soup, food, and washed clothes day and night. At these transfer stations, men and women, young and old, from various villages often went to comfort them day and night, sending eggs, rice, and fruit. Liu Junying, a women's representative from Dong Yongning, a deserted area, brought eggs and rice to the hospital to comfort the soldiers after the self-defense war began, requesting to take care of the colored signs in the hospital. They said excitedly: "This is our heart." Yes, they have a deeper feeling for this self-defense war because they have suffered too much persecution and massacre from Yan's puppets. Two little girls, Zhao Zhiming and Zhao Ruijin, from Santiao Gou, brought sesame candy and eggs from more than ten miles away to the hospital to comfort the soldiers. After the news of the capture of Hongdong City spread, countless comfort teams rushed to the city at midnight to help clean up the battlefield. Matou Village sent twelve carts, more than one hundred men and women, and each village sent loads of watermelons, peaches, and grapes to the city. They smiled and said along the way: "We have won."

　　　　People in Border Areas Organize Guerrilla Units, Want to Exchange Native Guns for American Weapons
【Yangcheng, 18th Dispatch】The Chiang-Yan army continues to expand the civil war along the Tongpu Line, deeply invading the liberated areas. The broad masses are extremely resentful and have requested the democratic government to allow them to enlist in the army, go to the front line to repel the Chiang-Yan army's attack, and defend a peaceful and democratic life. It is reported that in the five counties of Jincheng, Yicheng, Gaoping, Changzi, and Tunliu alone, there are 10,000 farmers who voluntarily request to join the army to defend the motherland. Li Fuhai, a farmer from Dong Dayang Village in Jincheng, said when he requested to enlist: "The Kuomintang reactionaries and the American reactionaries collude together to massacre the Chinese people. If they come, we will have no way to survive. I am willing to go to the front line to resist the attack of the reactionaries. Even if I personally sacrifice, it is glorious to protect the people's peace and democracy and protect the country's independence." People in the border areas have spontaneously organized guerrilla units. The local gun company of the Wangwu Sanyuan Joint Defense Village has one hundred and five people and is equipped with heavy fire weapons such as machine guns and grenade launchers. The People's Security Team was established in Xiangling. The militiamen took out old weapons such as raised guns, "pulaji" cannons (also called chicken coop cannons), hand-held cannons, bird guns, and machetes for use. They said: "When the stubborn army comes, we must get rid of them and must exchange them for American weapons."
