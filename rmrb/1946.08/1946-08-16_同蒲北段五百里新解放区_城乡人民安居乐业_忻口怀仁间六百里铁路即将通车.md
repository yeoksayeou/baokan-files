Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 6th. In the new liberated area of 500 li in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, stretching from Daiyue in the north to north of Xinxian city in the south, social order is being rapidly established, and the people are living and working in peace. In the counties of Shanyin, Ningwu, Guo County, Fanshi, and other important towns along the railway line such as Daiyue, Yangfangkou, Daniu Store, Yuanping, and Xinkou, the town public offices, street chiefs, and hundreds of village administrations along the line have all been established through democratic elections by the people. Workers, farmers, women, and merchants in Shuoxian, Ningwu city and other places have successively held meetings to pour out the sufferings they endured during the occupation by the puppet troops. In order to relieve the people's suffering, the democratic government distributed the seized grain and cloth to poor families of martyrs, disaster-stricken masses, and workers. In Ningwu and Daiyue, over 40,000 jin of grain were distributed to over 500 workers. Railway and electric light workers along the line are stepping up repairs to stations and factories, with some employees participating in trade unions and self-defense forces. Chambers of commerce in various towns have also been established one after another. Shops have transported over 10,000 bolts of cloth, 100,000 jin of salt, and about 10,000 shi of grain from the interior, selling them at low prices to small and medium-sized merchants and the masses.

Zhangjiakou, 10th. The 600-li railway between Xinkou and Huairen in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway has been actively restored and the railway administration is being reorganized since it came under the management of the democratic government. The entire line is expected to be officially opened to traffic soon. After the establishment of the Tongpu Railway Northern Section Office in mid-July, the first step was to mobilize workers, organize railway trade unions, and provide relief and resolve the problems of unemployment and re-employment for unemployed workers. More than 530 railway workers in Shuoxian, Ningwu, Xuan Gang, and Daiyue have been formally organized. After being liberated, the road workers at each station are extremely enthusiastic in their work, repairing equipment, nailing rails, and building bridges with a spirit of shock work. The existing train cars and locomotives along the line have been completely repaired. When the puppet troops fled, the original station workers automatically repaired a bridge car destroyed by the puppet rebels in just three or four days. Currently, the projects from Daiyue to Shuoxian and from Xinkou to Xuangang are nearing completion. In order to meet the urgent needs of merchants and civilians, it is planned to open the line in sections first.
