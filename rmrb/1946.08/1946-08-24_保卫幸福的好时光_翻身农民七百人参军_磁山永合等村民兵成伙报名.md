　　Defending the Good Times of Happiness
　　Seven Hundred Liberated Peasants Enlist
　　Militia Members from Cishan, Yonghe, and Other Villages Enlist in Groups
    [Report from This Newspaper] Under the call of the Central Bureau that "all young and middle-aged people in the entire region should enthusiastically join the People's Liberation Army to ensure that the main forces are continuously replenished," seven hundred liberated peasants in Wu'an, with high enthusiasm, voluntarily requested to join the army. An old farmer in Sanxiaohe, over sixty years old, said, "My family has just been liberated, we lack nothing now, we have land to cultivate, the cotton has been weeded five times, I can work, you go join the army," sending his only twenty-four-year-old son to the front lines. When Yang Tanbao from Hequ Village left to join the army, his wife saw him off, saying, "Come back after defeating Chiang Kai-shek." Women in Fengdian Village mobilized men to join the army, saying, "In the old days, you couldn't even sleep at home; this is going out to be a watchman, to protect us." Peasant Association member Su Yin, who threshed five shi of wheat this year after liberation, sent his son to join the army as soon as he heard about the civil war. The slogan of the youth in Baifu Village is: "Young and strong, quickly join the army, don't delay a good future." At the anti-civil war rally of the people in Yicheng, they recalled that on July 14th of last year, the traitor Yang Sizi took away 143 people from the village, killing one, beating three to death, starving eight to death, and three went missing. It cost 3 million yuan and a lot of copper, iron, and tin to redeem 128 people. Everyone said, "Yang Sizi is Chiang Kai-shek's man!" Thus, a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army was ignited. Hao Ru from Beianle, who had just returned from Anyang, introduced that local bandits were everywhere in Anyang, and the exorbitant taxes were even worse than Yang Sizi, which angered everyone. Militia members from Cishan, Hecun, Nandashe, Taixian, Yonghe, Xiyangfan, Guaitoushan, and other villages all signed up in groups. More than twenty young women from Chengnan Township were determined to join the army, but were persuaded by the government to stay and work in the rear. The masses in Kangsu Village guaranteed that the families of those fighting the war would not have three difficulties: plowing the land, carrying coal, and fetching water. The Wu'an County Party Committee recently held a meeting to welcome and encourage Communist Party members who joined the army, to fight to the end to defend the people and defend the liberation. The leading experience of this enlistment movement is mainly: combining the liberation struggle with joining the army, combining current affairs mobilization with resolving ideological issues, creating a mass upsurge in joining the army. Practice has proven that the liberated peasants have a high degree of enthusiasm and determination to defend their happy life and to defend the border region by participating in the patriotic self-defense war.

    【本报讯】武安翻身农民在中央局“全区一切青壮年要踊跃参加子弟兵，保证主力军不断满员”的号召下，有七百人以高度的热情，自动要求参军。三小河一个六十多岁的老农说：“我家才翻了身，什么也不缺了，有地种，棉花锄了五遍，我能劳动，你去参军”，送他仅有的一个二十四岁的儿子上了前线。河渠村杨谭保参军走时，他老婆送他说：“打垮蒋介石再回来”。峰店村妇女动员男人参军说：“老日子在时，你也不能在家睡，这是出去看门的，是去保护我们的。”农会员苏银，今年翻身打五石麦子，一听内战就送子参军。白府村青年的口号是：“年青力壮快参军，不能耽误好前程”。邑城群众反内战大会上想起去年七月十四那一天汉奸杨四子拉走村上一百四十三人，杀死一个、打死三个、饿死八个、失踪三个，花了三百万元，送了许多铜铁锡才赎回一百二十八个，大家都说：“杨四子就是蒋介石的人呀”！于是掀起参军热潮。北安乐郝如，才从安阳回来，介绍了安阳地方土匪遍地，苛捐杂税比杨四子还利害，激愤了大家。磁山、和村、南大社、抬贤、永合、西阳范、拐头山等村民兵都成伙报名。城南乡二十多个青年妇女决心参军，经政府劝说留后方工作。康宿村群众，保证抗属三不难，种地、驮煤、把水担。武安县委日前开会欢送与鼓励参军的共产党员，为保卫人民保卫翻身干到底。此次参军运动的领导经验，主要是：翻身斗争与参军结合，时事大动员与解决思想问题结合，造成群众参军热潮。实际证明翻了身的农民，对保卫自己幸福生活，保卫边区参加爱国自卫战，是具有高度的热情和决心的。（王庭栋）
