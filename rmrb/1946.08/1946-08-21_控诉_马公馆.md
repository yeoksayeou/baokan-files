Accusations Against "Ma Mansion"
　　Zhì Fèn, Xiǎo Nián
　　Stepping out of Jincheng East Gate, walking fifty or sixty steps past the East Great Bridge, eight imposing Western-style houses stand facing each other, flanking the road. This is the residence of the notorious chief traitor and chief Hui traitor, Ma Jun (now deceased). Before May, the oppressed people, just like they called the traitor Ma "Director Ma" or "Councilor Ma," referred to this residence as "Ma Mansion." Ma's family members were called "Old Madam Ma," "Eldest Young Master," "Third Young Master," etc. When talking about the rise of the Ma family, people would say, "The Ma family's graves have good feng shui; they have great fortune." Those slightly more aware of "external affairs" only dared to talk about the "glorious" history of Ma Jun himself: "Back when Yuan Shikai was trying to become emperor, he became a prominent figure, serving as the Hedong Observer; later, he followed Military Governor Yan, becoming the Chief of the Shanxi Military Police Enforcement Office, Hedong Dao Yin, Director of the Industry Department, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Director of the Education Department, and Chairman of the Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Association, as well as a senior councilor." Although people didn't know much about his activities after he defected to the enemy in 1943, there was a common saying: "No matter how he changes, he's always a big shot!"
　　In May, earth-shaking changes occurred in Jincheng East Gate. Laboring people, who hadn't dared to say a "no" to the Ma family for thirty years, spent over twenty days conducting individual, group, and large-scale accusations, exposing the Ma family's thirty years of dark and oppressive rule and their towering crimes. The Ma family's noble and beautiful exterior and facade were torn apart, and the ugly original form, filled with pus and blood, was exposed before everyone's eyes. According to the strong demands in their hearts for many years, the people changed the name "Ma Mansion" to "Hall of the King of Hell," and "Director Ma" to "Old King of Hell" or "Dead King of Hell." The Ma family members were renamed "Big King of Hell," "Second King of Hell," "Mother King of Hell," "Little Ghosts" (servants), and "Judges" (housekeepers).
　　How was "Ma Mansion" built? Ma's neighbors, Hui people Chen Jinhai, Chen Yīngou, Chen Qidan, and Han people Yang Songnv, Liu Gengen, Zhang Qundan, Meng Taiyi, etc., knew the details well. With tears in their eyes, they publicly recounted how their ancestors and themselves had saved money frugally for many years to build their houses, only to have them unreasonably seized by the Ma family, forcing them and their entire families to the Dragon King Temple, Grandmother's Temple, and Three Officials Temple, and then seizing all these temples as well, driving them out into the open air, suffering from hunger and cold. They said, "Ma Mansion, oh Ma Mansion, you were built on the bones of the poor!" To build his Western-style "Mansion," steel factory, and egg-beating factory (these two factories belonged to the "Eldest Young Master"), the traitor Ma forcibly occupied more than three hundred rooms of civilian houses and temples. During construction, the craftsmen were not paid, and those who transported bricks were not paid for their labor. × Xiaodan, an oil craftsman from Zhonghou River, angrily accused: "We oiled his house for a whole winter, and our hands and feet were so frozen that they cracked open, but he didn't give us a single penny! That's not all; once, when we were so cold that we couldn't bear it, we secretly went to warm ourselves by the fire, and the Eldest Young Master happened to see us! He beat us badly! After beating us, he made us kneel in the snow for a whole day, which caused us to become seriously ill and almost die!" At that time, there was a folk song in East Gate that said, "I'd rather have a donkey as a neighbor than hope for a neighbor to pass the imperial examination!" which reflected these countless grievances. (Note: Ma Jun was a student who studied in England, and the people of East Gate called him a "foreign successful candidate in the imperial examination.")
　　Let the people also accuse what happened after "Ma Mansion" was built. The "Eldest Young Master's" steel factory (i.e., his mansion) located on the south side of Lower East Gate even occupied the main road, forbidding pedestrians from passing. Li Weitu from Niujiang Village, because he didn't want to take a detour, secretly passed through, and the "Eldest Young Master" saw him, saying that he had disturbed his afternoon nap, and immediately ordered four "Little Ghosts" to grab his legs and arms and start "touring" him. After "touring" him to the point of near-death, he was finally thrown more than ten feet away, causing Li Weitu's chest to rupture and his lungs to collapse, and he died. Li Xiaosi from Gaodu was beaten severely and thrown into the mud for taking shelter from a rainstorm in front of someone's door for a few minutes, and his belongings were confiscated. He climbed to Qilingdian with his injuries that night, hired someone to carry him home, spent three strings of six hundred coins, and sold his only three mu of land to get treatment. His father died of anger, and his family broke up! Ma Gadou from Zhonghou River was "toured" into a cripple due to a similar incident and became disabled. There are countless people who have been "toured," and seventeen people have died from being "toured" alone.
　　Chen Guiying, the daughter of old man Chen Huamin from East Gate, was fancied by the "Eldest Young Master," who insisted on taking her as a concubine. The old man and his daughter were unwilling, so he sent the old man to the county government, detained him for half a month, and beat him half to death, finally giving the daughter to him. However, after only half a year, the daughter was thrown out, and she was not allowed to find a husband's family in Jincheng. In the end, she was forced to marry in Lucheng. The "Third Young Master" took a fancy to a seventeen-year-old girl named Da Yin, forcing her to marry his child. Yin felt that the family was too high-ranking and she couldn't match them, and his child was too young, so she was unwilling. The Third Young Master immediately sent her grandmother to the county government and detained her for seven days. Helpless, she also submitted with tears in her eyes. Liu Xiaofa, a young shop assistant, because he was clever and alert, was asked by the "Third Young Master" to be his attendant, but he was unwilling. The "Third Young Master" immediately notified his family: "If Xiaofa doesn't come, your family will not have peace!" Xiaofa's mother cried as she sent Xiaofa away, saying, "Child! We can't afford to offend them! Go! Serve them well!" Xiaofa lived in the Ma family for half a year and suffered countless grievances. Later, the "Third Young Master" asked him to buy Jindan pills. Xiaofa said, "It's too tight these days, I'm afraid something will happen!" The "Third Young Master" glared at him and said, "If you don't go, I'll beat you to death! If something happens, just say you bought them for me, Third Young Master!" Xiaofa was indeed caught and sent to the county government. The "Third Young Master" sent someone to threaten him, saying, "You can't mention a single word about the Ma family, even if you're beaten to death! If you mention it, I'll take your head!" Xiaofa was afraid, so he took the blame entirely on himself. He went through several trials, was beaten several times to the point of near-death, but never changed his story. Who knew that people don't eat wolves, but wolves eat people. Ma Jun, in order to protect his reputation as the chairman of the Anti-Drug Association, secretly ordered County Magistrate Zhang Honghui to find a way to shoot Xiaofa, "to uphold the law."
　　The dozens of maids and old women in the Ma family lived an even more inhuman life. Dan Maoshi served the "Old Madam." Because she combed the Old Madam's hair and one strand fell out, she was beaten three or four times to the point of near death. Ma Funv looked after a child, and because the child cried once, she was beaten to the ground by the "Old Madam" with a horsewhip. She was also locked up and starved for two days and forced to kneel in a snowdrift for a day. She wasn't allowed to drink a drop of water for three days. Because the "Old Madam" was tired from beating Funv, Funv had to rub her legs and massage her back. Another maid was mistreated to the point of committing suicide by jumping into a urine pit.
　　The masses recounted more than one hundred cases of murder and bloodshed caused by "Ma Mansion" and countless cases of beatings, "touring," forced occupation, and extortion, causing grief and resentment. People were crying in the courtyards and rooms, crying at the meetings, and crying on the streets of East Gate. At the meeting on the 10th, Liu Xiaofa's mother cried until she passed out, and the wife of Hui person Guo Yahong cried until she died. Liu Zhanyuan and his child Liu Xiaosheng also cried themselves to death one after another. The masses shed the tears of brothers of the same fate, rescuing their brothers. When the rescued people, gasping for breath, shouted "Revenge! Revenge!" the masses' iron fists immediately and violently swung towards the Kings of Hell and the Judges.
　　The democratic government, completely in accordance with the public will of the oppressed people, announced the confiscation of all the traitor Ma's property, compensation for the victims, the return of the more than three hundred rooms forcibly occupied from the masses, the three hundred mu of land and two thousand two hundred shi of grain extorted and plundered from the masses. The masses immediately shouted with wild joy, "Long live the democratic government!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and bowed and saluted the huge statue of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in the center of the meeting place, vowing, "We ordinary people will follow you to the end!" Old man Chen Xihai, who was over seventy years old, squeezed to the front with his cane, bowed deeply, and said to himself, "It's only right to kowtow to you!"
　　On the last day of the accusation movement—the afternoon of May 28th—the masses carried the spiritual tablets of more than one hundred wronged dead people who had been vindicated, along with six tables of sacrificial offerings, and held a grand funeral procession. At the front of the demonstration was a large horizontal plaque with the words "Seek Justice and Avenge Wrongs," followed by the militia self-defense team carrying rifles and knives, and women and children all covered with white towels, waving various small flags. On them were written: "The Ma family is a nest of turtles, drinking people's blood!" "The Ma family is a pack of wolves, hurting people every day!" The Ma family's "Kings of Hell" and "Judges," according to the orders of the masses, wore hemp and filial piety, carried mourning sticks, and shouted "Father!" "Mother!" while pulling the spirits. But this could not reduce the sadness of the relatives of the wronged dead. These relatives were carried on ten or so large carts, crying loudly all the way, and the entire demonstration procession shed tears upon hearing the sound. The group proceeded to the intersection of the city and held a sacrifice, then turned to South Gate and proceeded via Little Character Street and Horizontal Street, holding another sacrifice and a re-sacrifice. The entire urban and rural residents and villagers who came to town participated. The streets, five or six zhang wide, were filled with a dark mass of people, shrouded in the sound of bitter tears and sobs. An old man wiped away his tears and snot and said, "Fresh blood accumulates into a thousand years of hatred, when will this revenge be repaid? There are more than just these one hundred people killed by Ma Jun! Not to mention Shanxi Province, but in Jincheng County alone, they are countless!"
　　When the procession finally arrived at the South Teaching Field to hold the "Spirit Burning," even more sacrificers gathered. The sound of drums and music, the sound of crying, and the slogans of seeking justice and revenge, mixed into a deafening roar that shook the mountains. (Taiyue Communications)

　　控诉“马公馆”
　　志奋　小年
    步出晋城东关，走过东大桥五六十步远，八座巍峨的大洋房，南北对峙，夹道而立，这就是著名的大汉奸、大回奸马骏（己死）的住宅。五月份以前，被压迫的人民，如像称马逆为“马厅长”、“马参议”一样，把这宅子称做“马公馆”。马家的人，被称为“马老太太”、“大少爷”、“三少爷”等。谈到马家的发迹，便说“马家坟里有脉气，福份大”。稍知“外事”的，关于马逆本人，也只敢谈谈人家的“光荣”史迹：“人家在袁世凯坐皇帝那时候，就成了红人，当了河东观察使；后来跟着阎督军，当山西军警执法处长、河东道尹、实业厅长、民政厅长、教育厅长、禁烟拒毒会长，高级参议。”关于他在民国三十二年投敌以后的事情，虽然人们知道的并不多，但也有个共同的说法：“变来变去，反正总是大头儿吧！”
    五月，晋城东关起了翻天覆地的大变化。三十年来没敢说过马家一个“不”字的劳动人民。连续二十余日地进行个别的、小组的与大会的控诉，把马家三十年来暗无天日的统治与滔天的罪恶统统揭发出来。马家的高贵华美的外长与面幕被撕裂了，包脓里血的丑恶原形，毕露于睽睽万目之前。人民依照着多年来内心的强烈要求，将“马公馆”改称“阎王殿”，“马厅长”改称“老阎王”、“死阎王”。马家的人，则改称“大阎王”、“二阎王”、“母阎王”、“小鬼”（用人）、“判官”（管家）。
    “马公馆”是怎样建造起来的呢？马家的邻居回民陈进孩、陈银狗、陈其蛋、汉民杨松女、刘根根、张群旦、孟泰义等是深知底细的。他们流着泪，当众诉说出自己祖上和自己好多年省吃俭用，修盖了房院，而被马家无理霸占，把自己和全家老小撵到龙王庙、奶奶堂、三官庙，以及又连这些庙宇统统霸占，把他们撵到露天，啼饥号寒的全部冤苦史实。他们说：“马公馆呀马公馆，你是从穷人的骨头上架起来的呀！”马逆为建造自己的洋式“公馆”、炼钢厂、打蛋厂（这二厂归“大少”），强霸民房庙宇竟达三百间以上。修盖时，匠人不给工钱，拉砖不给脚价。中后河油匠×小旦激愤的控诉：“咱给人家油了整整一冬天房子，冻得手上脚上都张了嘴（裂了缝），可是人家一个工钱都不给！这还不算；有一回咱冻得实在吃不住啦，偷去烤了烤火，偏叫大少爷碰见啦，好打！打了还不行，罚咱跪在雪地整冻了一天，害了一场大病，差一点没病死！”当时东关有句民谣说：“宁愿邻居买条驴，不盼邻居中个举！”即是反映这数不清的冤苦的。（按马逆是留英学生，东关人民称之为“洋举人”。）
    “马公馆”建成以后的事，也让人民控诉吧。位于下东关南头大路边的“大少爷”的炼钢厂（即其公馆）竟连大路也据为己有，不许行人通行了。牛匠村李唯土因为不想绕路，偷着由此通过，被“大少爷”碰上了，说是惊了他的午睡，立即喝令四个“小鬼”捉着两腿两臂打起“游”来。“游”了个七死八活，最后一摔丈多远，摔得唯土胸开肺裂，不治而死。高都李小四因在人家门前避了几分钟暴雨，被推在泥里饱打一顿，东西也没收了。他连夜带伤爬到七岭店，雇人抬回家去，花了三串六百钱、卖了仅有的三亩地才治好。父亲气死了，一家人散啦！中后河马疙瘩因类似事故，被“游”成拐子，残废了。被“游”过的不知有多少，光“游”死的就有十七人。
    东关陈化民老汉的闺女陈桂英被“大少爷”看上了，立逼着要她当小老婆，老汉、闺女都不愿意，结果把老汉送到县府，押了半个月，打了个半死，终于把闺女给了人家。不过半年，这闺女又被扔出门来，还不准在晋城找婆家，最后被逼得嫁到潞城去了。“三少爷”看中了十七岁的姑娘达银的，逼着叫嫁给他孩子，银的觉得人家官大门楼高，攀配不起，他孩子又太小，不愿意去。三少即将她奶奶送到县府，扣了七天。无可奈何，也饮泪屈服了。做买卖的小伙计刘小法，因为聪明机警，“三少”要他当勤务，他不愿意，“三少”即通知他家：“若是小法不来，你家全不得安生！”小法的母亲哭着把小法送走时说：“孩呀！咱惹不起人家！去吧！好好伺候人家！”小法在马家住了半年，受了不知多少气；后来“三少”叫他去买金丹，小法说：“这几天太紧，怕出事！”“三少”把眼一瞪：“不去我就打死你！出了事你就说给我三少爷买的！”小法果然被查获，送到了县政府。“三少”却着人去威吓他说：“打死也不能提我姓马的一个字！提了就要你脑袋！”小法害怕，便一手包在自己身上。连过几堂，打了几个死，始终没变。谁知人不吃狼，狼要吃人，马骏为维护自己禁毒会长的名誉，竟密令县长张鸿惠设法将小法枪毙，“以正国法”。
    马家的几十个丫环和老妈子，更是过着非人的生活。丹毛氏侍候“老太太”，因为给人家梳头发梳掉一根，被打得死了三四次。马富女看小孩，因小孩哭了一声，被“老太太用马鞭子打得满地滚，还被锁起来饿了两天，在雪堆里跪了一天。三天连水都不准喝一口。“老太太”因打富女累了，富女还得去搓腿捶背。另外有个丫环，被虐待到投尿坑自尽。
    群众诉说着一百多件“马公馆”制造的人命血案和无数件被打、被“游”、被霸占、被敲诈的伤心冤事，院里屋里在哭，会场在哭，东关的街道上也在哭。十号的大会上，刘小法妈哭的量过去了，回民郭亚红老婆哭断了气，刘占元和他的孩子刘小升，也一先一后哭死过去。全场群众流着同命运的兄弟之泪，抢救着自己的兄弟。当被救活的人上气不接下气地连声喊着“报仇呀！报仇呀！”的时候，群众的铁拳立即暴烈地挥向阎王和判官们。
    民主政府完全依照被压迫人民公意，宣布了没收马逆全部财产，抚恤被害者，偿还群众被强占的三百多间房子，被敲诈掠夺的三百亩土地和二千二百石粮食时，群众立即狂欢地喊出“民主政府万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”并纷纷向会场正中间的毛主席、朱总司令巨像鞠躬行礼，发誓说：“俺们老百姓跟着你老人家干到底！”七十多岁的陈喜孩老汉拄着拐杖挤到跟前，深深地鞠了一躬，自言自语说：“给你老人家磕头也应该！”
    控诉运动的最后一天——五月二十八日下午，群众抬着一百多个昭雪了的冤死者的灵位，和六桌祭礼供食，举行送葬大游行。示威行列的前面是“申冤复仇”的大横匾，后面民兵自卫队背着步枪和刀矛，妇女儿童都罩着白手巾，摇动着各色小旗。上面写着：“马家一窝鳖，天大喝人血！”“马家一群狼，每天把人伤！”马家的“阎王”、“判官”们，依照着群众的命令，披麻带孝、拄着哭丧棒、“爹呀！”“娘呀！”的在扯灵。但这完全不能减少冤死者亲属们的悲伤。这些亲属被载在十来辆大车上，一路放声痛哭，整个示威行列闻声落泪。大队进至城内十字街行祭毕，转向南关进发，路经小字街、横街，举行又祭、再祭。整个城关居民与乡下进城来的老乡都参加了。五六丈宽的街道上，塞满了黑魆魆的人群里，笼罩着酸泪与唏嘘啜泣之声。一个老者擦着眼泪和鼻涕说：“鲜血积成千年恨，此仇不报待何时？被马骏害死的，何只这一百多人呀！不说山西省，光咱晋城县也数不清！”
    游行的行列最后行抵南教场举行“化灵”时，祭者集结得更多了。鼓乐声、哭声、申冤报仇的口号声，搅成一片震撼出岳的轰响。（太岳通讯）
