Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 22nd: The textile industry in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region has gradually become self-sufficient, and some areas are already able to export in large quantities. With Gaoyang in central Hebei as the center, it has developed to Qingyuan, Lixian, Suning, Anxin and other places. In addition to meeting local needs, it exports a large amount to the provinces of Rehe and Ningxia. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Gaoyang had 60,000 looms, with an annual output of 1.7 million bolts of cloth. During the occupation, only 3,000 looms remained. Since its liberation last year, the Jizhong Bank has provided 15 million yuan in loans to support it. By June of this year, the scale has exceeded ten times that of the occupation period. 74% of the villages in the county, the majority of farmers and women have participated in textile production. The number of women spinners united in cooperatives and mutual aid groups alone has reached more than 20,000, spinning 120,000 catties of yarn per month. More than 18,000 people in the county weave 90,000 bolts of cloth per month. According to incomplete statistics, more than 50,000 women in seven counties including Yixian, Mancheng, and Xushui have participated in textile production. Yixian alone has more than 38,000 spinning wheels and more than 4,200 looms, and has woven more than 240,000 bolts of cloth in the past six months. With the new cotton on the market in the second half of the year and the winter slack season, it is estimated that the output will exceed the first half of the year. In the three special districts of Ji-Jin, according to statistics from Pingshan County and one district of Jianping County alone, the number of spinning wheels has increased from more than 20,000 last year to more than 30,000. Wanxian weaves 1,000 bolts of cloth and 1,000 dozens of towels every day, and can export 150,000 bolts of cotton cloth and 200,000 dozens of towels throughout the year. In the northeast of Shanxi, north of Yanmen Pass and parts of Chahar, where there was no textile industry before, the textile industry is also gradually developing. In one district of Lingqiu alone, 1,000 spinning wheels have been added this year. In the three districts of Yu and Guo counties, more than 1,300 people have participated in textile production, weaving more than 2,400 bolts of cloth and spinning 12,600 catties of yarn in the past six months.

　　晋察冀纺织渐足自给
    部分地区已大量输出
    【新华社张家口二十二日电】晋察冀边区纺织业已逐渐走向自给，部分地区已能大量输出。冀中以高阳为中心，发展到清苑、蠡县、肃宁、安新等地，出产除自给外，大量输出热、宁各省。高阳抗战前，曾拥有布机六万架，年产布一百七十万匹。沦陷时仅剩下三千张织布机。去年解放后，冀中银行贷款一千五百万元扶助，至今六月规模已超过沦陷时十倍以上。全县百分之七十四村庄，大部农民与妇女参加了纺织。仅团结于合作社互助组周围的纺妇，即达二万余人，每月纺纱十二万斤。全县一万八千余人织布月产布九万匹。易县、满城、徐水等七个县，据不完全统计，已有五万余妇女参加了纺织。仅易县即有纺车三万八千余架，织机四千二百余架，半年来织布二十四万余匹。后半年新花上市，冬季农闲估计出产将超过上半年。冀晋三专区纺织业，仅据平山县与建屏县一个区的统计，纺车已由去年的二万余辆增至三万余辆，完县每日织布千匹，手巾千打，全年可输出棉布十五万匹，手巾二十万打。素无纺织基础的晋东北、雁北与察哈尔部分地区，纺织业也在逐渐发展。灵邱一个区，今年即增加纺车一千辆。盂、崞两县的三个区，也有一千三百余人参加了纺织，半年来已织布二千四百余匹，纺纱一万二千六百余斤。
