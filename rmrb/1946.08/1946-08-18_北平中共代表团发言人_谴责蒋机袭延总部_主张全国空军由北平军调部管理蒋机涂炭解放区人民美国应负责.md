Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 15th -- The spokesperson of the CCP Delegation in Beiping Military Mediation Department, regarding Chiang Kai-shek's use of American aircraft to continuously bomb various liberated areas, particularly the bombing of the Yan'an Headquarters on August 2nd, issued another statement on the 10th. It pointed out: "Whether it admits it or not, the US government should be responsible for the Kuomintang air force's atrocities across the country." The spokesperson recounted that from the January ceasefire agreement to July 28th, Kuomintang aircraft intruded into various liberated areas 731 times, attacked liberated area towns and cities 268 times, causing 1,400 civilian casualties and destroying over 1,200 houses. The spokesperson pointed out: It is evident that when China's dictator and war maniac, Chiang Kai-shek, holds these offensive weapons, he will undoubtedly use them without restraint to destroy production and slaughter the people, further worsening the situation in China. Moreover, the bombing of the Yan'an Headquarters by eight Kuomintang American-made aircraft on August 2nd sent a signal of full-scale civil war. The spokesperson pointed out: Regarding this matter, the CCP delegations in Nanjing and Beiping have both received instructions and conclusive evidence from Yan'an and have lodged the most serious protests with the Kuomintang government, but have not yet received a reply. If the government wishes to deny that this is a signal for its full-scale civil war, the government should immediately take the following measures: (1) Order an investigation into this atrocity and severely punish the officers responsible for the atrocity. (2) The entire Chinese air force should be placed under the management and supervision of the Beiping Executive Headquarters to limit its deepening of the Chinese civil war and the slaughter of the Chinese people. The spokesperson then explained the relationship between the Kuomintang aircraft's atrocities and the United States: "The whole world knows that these airplanes, airplane gasoline, weapons, and ammunition used to slaughter the Chinese people are all made in the United States. The US government has achieved peace throughout the world and has stopped the Lend-Lease Act to other countries, but it has extended the Lend-Lease Act to China alone, handing over a large number of murderous weapons to the Kuomintang government. All of Chiang Kai-shek's aviation personnel have also been trained by American officers in the United States, India, or China. The Kuomintang air force is essentially fostered by the United States. The US government has done everything for them, except actually pulling the trigger of the machine gun themselves." The spokesperson finally firmly stated: "All peace-loving and democratic people in China unanimously condemn the US government's two-faced policy of, on the one hand, claiming to be a neutral mediator in China, and on the other hand, actually helping the Kuomintang to launch a civil war. We firmly demand that the US government promptly withdraw all military aircraft and military parts it has given to the Kuomintang government from China, so as not to deepen the Chinese civil war and inflict suffering on the Chinese people, in order to show the US government's neutral position."

　　北平中共代表团发言人
    谴责蒋机袭延总部
    主张全国空军由北平军调部管理蒋机涂炭解放区人民美国应负责
    【新华社北平十五日电】北平军调部中共代表团发言人，为蒋介石使用美国飞机连续轰炸各解放区，特别是八月二日轰炸延安总部事，又于十日发表谈话。指出：“无论其承认与否，美国政府对国民党空军在全国的暴行应负其责”。发言人历述自一月停战协议以来，至七月二十八日，国民党飞机窜扰各解放区达七百三十一次，袭击解放区市镇二百六十八次，平民一千四百人被炸伤亡，房屋一千二百余间被炸毁。发言人指出：显而易见的，当中国独裁者战争狂的蒋介石手中握有这些进攻性的武器，就一定会无限制的用来破坏生产与屠杀人民，使中国局势益形恶化。而八月二日八架国民党美造飞机的轰炸延安总部，更发出了全面内战的信号。发言人指出：关于此事，南京和北平的中共代表团均接获延安指示及确凿的证据，已向国民党政府提出最严重的抗议，但至今未获答复。如果政府欲否认此举为其全面内战信号，政府应立即采取下述措施：（一）下令调查此次暴行，严厉处罚暴行负责军官。（二）全部中国空军应置于北平执行部管理监督之下，以限止其加深中国内战及屠杀中国人民。发言人继而说明国民党飞机的暴行和美国的关系：“举世皆知，用于屠杀中国人民的这些飞机、飞机的汽油、武器、弹药，全部是美国制造的。美国政府在全世界已获得和平，并对其他国家都停止了租借法案，而恰恰单独延长对中国的租借，将一切杀人武器大量交给国民党政府。蒋介石所有的航空人员，也都是由美国军官在美国、印度或中国训练出来的，国民党空军实质上是美国一手扶植起来的。美国政府已帮他们做尽了一切，只差没有亲手去搬动机枪的机柄罢了。”发言人最后坚称：“全中国一切爱好和平、民主的人民，一致谴责美国政府在中国一面表示自己是中立的调处人，一面又实际上帮助国民党发动内战的两面政策。我们坚决要求美国政府将它给国民党政府的一切军用飞机及其军火零件迅速从中国收回，以免加深中国内战，涂炭中国人民，以表示美国政府之中立地位。”
