Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 14th: The Kuomintang authorities recently organized a Chinese and foreign journalist inspection group to fly over the flood area in northern Jiangsu for aerial inspection, attempting to cover up their conspiracy of using flooding caused by bombing river embankments to aid military offensives and to verify the fabricated rumors that the Communist Party "breached the dikes" in northern Jiangsu, in order to shift the blame onto others. The flood area inspected by the group was caused by the Yangzhou Kuomintang authorities preventing the Yangtze River from receiving water from the Grand Canal since June of this year. Many foreign reporters from France, Britain, and Canada who participated in the inspection reported that this trip yielded no results. The Kuomintang authorities' habitual trick of distorting the truth through propaganda organs has once again been declared a failure. It has been a long-standing practice for the Kuomintang authorities to use dike breaching and flooding as a tool for political and military struggle. (1) As early as June of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Kuomintang authorities sent troops to breach the dikes at Huayuankou in Henan, diverting the Yellow River, drowning more than 300,000 innocent people and impoverishing more than 1.7 million. (2) In the spring of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), Yin Kaizhi, the Kuomintang magistrate of Taikang County, was ordered to breach the dikes in the area south of Cuiqiao in the county. (3) In May of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the Twelfth Commissioner's Office of the Henan Provincial Government of the Kuomintang breached the dikes at Qizi Xu again. (4) In June of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), Zhang Jingzhong, the county magistrate of Wuzhi County, and Meng Yunwu, the district chief, dug open the Mian River dike between Donghongqiao and Wuchekou within the county. (5) After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, on September 10th of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), Cao Shiyi's Kuomintang Weishi Security Regiment breached three openings in the Yellow River dike south of Zhuxian Town. (6) In September of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the Xu Tieying and Wang Zemin troops, incorporated by the Kuomintang, breached the Puyang River east of Yongnian County. (7) In September of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the Xu Chunlin troops, formerly puppet troops incorporated by the Kuomintang stationed in Botou Town, breached the Grand Canal dike at the Dawangmiao section south of Bonan; in January of this year, the troops breached the Grand Canal dike again. (8) In March of this year, the Kuomintang obstructed the construction of the Grand Canal, using airplanes to wantonly strafe the river construction workers in the Liubao area of Baoying; on April 8th, at the Liujiao section of Shaobo, the 118th Regiment of the Kuomintang stationed troops strafed the river construction workers with machine guns. (9) In May of this year, the Kuomintang did everything possible to obstruct the Feihe dredging project. (10) Since June of this year, the Kuomintang authorities in Yangzhou have blocked all dams leading to the Yangtze River, preventing the Grand Canal from flowing into the river, creating an artificial flood in Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua and other places in the liberated areas of Jiangsu and Anhui (this is what the Kuomintang propaganda organs are clamoring about). (11) Since July, they have continuously bombed various sections of the embankments of the Grand Canal and Shu River in Jiangsu and Anhui, and strafed the canal repair workers everywhere. On July 21st, canal repair workers in Zaohe Town were strafed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, resulting in nine deaths and injuries; on July 29th, a UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) ship carrying summer flood prevention supplies for the Grand Canal, docked at Wangying, Huaiyin, was sunk by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, resulting in 32 deaths and injuries. (12) In July of this year, Kuomintang troops and the puppet troops incorporated by them in Jing'an, Jinghai, and Dacheng and other places destroyed the Jia Kou and Zhan Wa diversion works which had just been completed. (13) In July of this year, the Kuomintang army and puppet bandits in Shijiazhuang destroyed the Haojin Canal, a large-scale project along the Tuo River. (14) On July 27th of this year, the Jiang army Zhang Huatang's troops stationed in Cang County and the puppet troops Li Jingwen and Wang Yongsheng's troops dispatched troops to Zhao Chengzi for the third time to breach the dikes, opening a breach of more than fifty feet twice, as of May 10th and July 23rd.
