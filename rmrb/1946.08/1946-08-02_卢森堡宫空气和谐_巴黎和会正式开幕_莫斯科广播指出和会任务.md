Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Paris dispatch: The twenty-one nation peace conference officially opened at 4 PM yesterday in the Luxembourg Palace. French Prime Minister Bidault delivered the opening speech, representing France in welcoming the participating delegates. Bidault stated: that he deeply believed that the delegates from all countries could work together for peace in a good atmosphere. After Bidault's speech, U.S. representative Byrnes proposed electing Bidault as interim chairman and Dubal as secretary-general. Byrnes' proposal was adopted. Bidault proposed establishing a proposal review committee composed of seven countries: Australia, the Soviet Union, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia, and the Netherlands, which was also approved by the conference. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt then offered opinions regarding the establishment of an agenda committee and explained in detail. Afterwards, Bidault proposed that the committee convene at 10 AM. The next conference is scheduled for 4 PM today to discuss general issues.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Moscow Radio stated: The Council of Foreign Ministers completed preparations for the peace conference on July 19th. Consensus agreements have been reached on the majority of the draft treaties and the most important provisions. Therefore, the five-nation treaty has completed the first stage of its work. This conference is of great significance. Although consensus has been reached on the majority of issues, some issues remain to be resolved. The task of the conference participants is to participate in the review of the draft treaties and specifically formulate provisions regarding the various unresolved issues. These unresolved issues are some economic issues, such as issues concerning compensation for losses suffered by the United Nations. Because the conference participants should not only participate in the discussion of the provisions on which the conference has reached unanimous agreement, but should also make suggestions regarding the various unresolved issues. The twenty-one countries participating in the conference have every possibility to complete the second stage of the preparatory treaties, and to overcome newly encountered difficulties. Parisian newspapers are paying great attention to the conference, pointing out that disagreements seem likely to occur between large and small powers regarding the formulation of the final provisions of the treaties. However, those with far-sighted vision believe that the consensus agreement already reached by the Four Great Powers cannot but influence the conference, because the recommendations made by the Council of Foreign Ministers to the conference represent the interests of both large and small powers.

　　卢森堡宫空气和谐
    巴黎和会正式开幕
    莫斯科广播指出和会任务
    【新华社延安三十日电】巴黎讯：二十一国和平会议，于昨日下午四时在卢森堡宫正式开幕，法总理比道尔致开幕词，代表法国欢迎与会代表。比氏声称：即深信各国代表能在良好的气氛中共同为和平而工作。比氏致词后，美代表贝纳斯提议选举比道尔为临时主席，杜巴尔克为秘书长，贝氏提议被通过。比道尔提议成立提案审查委员会，由澳洲、苏联、巴西、捷克、阿比西尼亚、荷兰等七国组成，亦获大会同意。澳外长伊瓦特继起发表关于成立议程委员会的意见，并详加解释以后，比道尔提议该委员会于十时召开。下次大会定今日下午四时举行，讨论一般问题。
    【新华社延安三十日电】莫斯科广播称：外长会议已于七月十九日完成了对于和会的准备工作，对于大多数和约草案而且是最重要的条文，已达到一致的协定，因此五国和约已完成了第一阶段的工作。这次和会是有重大的意义，虽然有大多数问题已达到协定，但一部分问题还待解决。和会参加者的任务，是参加审查和约草案，具体制订关于那些尚未解决的各项问题的条文，这些未解决的问题，系一些经济问题，如关于赔偿联合国损失等问题。因为和会参加者不仅应该参加讨论对会议已获一致协议的条文，而且应该对于尚未解决的各项问题提出建议。参加和会的二十一国，有一切可能完成准备和约第二阶段的工作，克服新遇到的困难。巴黎报纸对于和会给以很大的注意，指出关于制订和约的最终条文，大小强国之间似乎将发生分歧，然而眼光深远的人，认为四大强国已达到的一致协议，对于和会不能不发生影响，因为外长会议向和会所提出的建议，是代表大小强国的利益的。
