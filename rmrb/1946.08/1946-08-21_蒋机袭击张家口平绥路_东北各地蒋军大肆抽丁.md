Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th. Zhangjiakou, the capital of the Jin-Cha-Ji liberated area, was attacked by Chiang planes at 3:00 PM on the 13th. On the same day, Yanggao and Wangguantun stations, important stations on the Ping綏 Railway, and passenger train No. 302 were also repeatedly strafed. In the past month, Chiang and American planes have repeatedly intruded into the airspace over towns and cities in the Jin-Cha-Ji liberated area for reconnaissance, but protests have been ineffective. Since the 11th, the intrusions have become even more frequent. On the 13th alone, Chiang planes made four sorties. On that day, Chiang's P-40 planes strafed the Zhangyuan airport repeatedly eight times, and also strafed Yanggao and Wangguantun stations and passenger train No. 302 departing from Yanggao at low altitude. A total of more than ten planes were dispatched, wounding 17 residents and killing six.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. According to reports in the Pingjin newspapers, Chiang's troops are forcibly conscripting recruits on a large scale in the Northeast to replenish the casualties and desertions of their soldiers. The planned total is 80,000, with Liaoning Province alone conscripting more than 28,000. The Shenyang city received an order from Chiang Kai-shek's Northeast Headquarters to replenish troops, originally requiring 5,000 to be conscripted by the end of July, and then received an order to increase the recruitment by 1,500. As of now, less than half of this quota has been completed. Young and able-bodied men in urban and rural areas under Kuomintang rule flee far away at the news, and the number fleeing to the Democratic Allied Forces areas is increasing daily.

　　蒋机袭击张家口平绥路  东北各地蒋军大肆抽丁
    【新华社张家口十八日电】晋察冀解放区首府张家口，于十三日下午三日时遭受蒋机袭击，与此同日，平绥铁路重要车站阳高、王官屯车站及第三零二次客车亦被连续扫射。最近一月来，晋察冀解放区各城镇上空迭有蒋机或美机侵入侦察，屡次抗议无效。自十一日起，侵扰更为频繁。十三日一日，蒋机竟出动四次，是日蒋机ＰＯＯ式飞张垣机场反复扫射八次，并低空扫射阳高、王官屯车站及自阳高开出之三零二次客车，共出动飞机十余架，伤居民十七人，死六人。
    【新华社延安十八日电】据平津报载：蒋军在东北大肆抽丁，以补充其士兵的伤亡与逃散，预定总额为八万名，仅辽宁一省即征二万八千余名。沈阳市奉到蒋介石东北行营补充兵员命令，原限七月底征齐五千名，旋又奉到增募一千五百名之命令，时至目前，尚未完成此额之半。国民党统治城乡青壮闻风远扬，逃亡民主联军地区者日众。
