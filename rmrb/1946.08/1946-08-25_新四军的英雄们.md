Xinhua News Agency, Huaibei Front, 22nd -- In the Yugou and Chaoyangji self-defense battles in eastern Huaibei last month, all commanders and soldiers of the New Fourth Army demonstrated unparalleled bravery and skill in combat. Yuan Zhirong, the second platoon leader of the heroic first company of a certain regiment, commanded his entire platoon to repel two fierce attacks by five or six hundred Chiang troops. When the Chiang troops charged again, both of his arms were wounded, but he insisted on directing the battle, finally defeating the third assault by the Chiang troops. A combat team of three men from the fourth squad of the second company, led by Xia Nuotian, engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Chiang troops, resulting in the killing or wounding of fourteen Chiang soldiers. Another combat team, led by Xin Wuping, repelled an attack by over a hundred Chiang troops and captured two heavy machine guns. Min Fanwu, the third squad leader of a certain company, led his entire squad in a reckless and courageous charge, capturing a total of three machine guns, one carbine, and several revolvers. After Gao Weigong, a soldier of a certain company, seized a light machine gun without bullets, he was surrounded by Chiang troops. Seeing another Chiang soldier carrying machine gun ammunition, he quickly shot and killed that Chiang soldier, seized the machine gun ammunition, broke through the encirclement of the Chiang troops, and captured a total of one machine gun and five rifles. Dai Ruijiu, the first platoon leader of the third company of a certain regiment, was wounded twice in the battle. In order to eliminate the stubbornly resisting Chiang troops, he saw that the prepared explosives had not detonated. Disregarding his wounds, he rushed forward with a rifle and accurately shot at the explosive charge. Amidst the sounds of gunfire and explosions, all the Chiang troops who refused to surrender were killed.

　　新四军的英雄们
    【新华社淮北前线二十二日电】上月下旬淮北路东，渔沟、朝阳集自卫战役中，新四军全体指战员表现了无比的英勇善战。某团老英雄一连二排长芫之荣指挥全排打退蒋军五六百人的两次猛扑。接着蒋军又冲上来，他的两膀都挂了彩，但仍坚持指挥战斗，终于打垮了蒋军的第三次冲锋。二连四班由三人组成的战斗小组，在夏挪田率领下，和蒋军肉搏结果，三个人毙伤蒋军十四名。以辛五平为首的另一个战斗小组，打垮了蒋军百余人的进攻，夺获了两挺重机枪。某连三班长闵凡五率领全班不顾一切的勇猛冲击，共夺获了三挺机枪，一枝卡宾式和几只左轮枪。某连战士高维公夺到一挺没有子弹的轻机枪后被蒋军包围了，这时他看见另一个蒋军正肩着机枪弹，他敏捷地击毙那个蒋军，夺来机枪弹，击破了蒋军的包围，共夺得一挺机枪和五枝步枪。某团三连一排长戴瑞九在战斗中两次负伤后，为了要消灭困守顽抗的蒋军，他看到安好了的炸药没有爆炸，便不顾自己的伤口提着一枝步枪冲上前去，向炸药包准确地打了一枪，在枪声与爆炸声的击鸣下，拒绝投降的蒋军全部牺牲。
