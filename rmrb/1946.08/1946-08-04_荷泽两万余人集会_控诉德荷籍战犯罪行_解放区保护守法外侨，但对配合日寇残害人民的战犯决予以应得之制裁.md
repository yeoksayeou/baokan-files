[Heze News] A rally of over 20,000 citizens in Heze City to accuse the German and Dutch war criminals of the Japanese寇 Fifth Column, Gao Tianda and ten others, of their crimes, lasting three days, has concluded with initial success. Around the 15th of last month, the Municipal Government successively received over a hundred indictments from the masses accusing eleven German and Dutch war criminals, including He Fangji, Gao Tianda, Tao He, Majialuo, Nai Tianzhen, and Dabaier, of using the guise of priests to help the Japanese寇 attack the Chinese mainland and massacre Chinese compatriots. After careful investigation, the Municipal Government obtained conclusive and sufficient evidence and arrested them at the request of the people. The indictment began on the 15th, and people from over a hundred miles away got up in the middle of the night, carrying lanterns and torches to testify. The conference was held in the scorching sun of July for three days, and the emotions of the masses remained extremely angry. The loudspeaker first broadcast the excited voice of citizen Shi Xiuzhong, who accused Majialuo of manufacturing batteries for the traitor Wang Xian to supply the enemy's communication. The masses of Li Balao Village, sixty miles away from Heze City, accused the German priest Xue with unparalleled anger, that on September 13th of the 32nd year of the Republic, he led the Japanese寇 to the village and killed twelve civilians and thirteen Eighth Route Army soldiers, and looted more than a hundred rifles from the Eighth Route Army and militiamen, and smashed 130 cooking pots of the masses, making it impossible for the masses to cook. Then, twenty-three people successively listed facts accusing them of directly harming the masses in collusion with the Japanese寇 and traitors. Wang Wenbao accused them of relying on the Japanese寇 to plunder two million catties of lime, 1.7 million bricks, and 2,000 tons of timber, which were public building materials stored in the Catholic Church; the materials were originally donated by twelve counties near Heze City before the July 7th Incident to build a model prison in Heze. When Li Zhankui, Wang Kaichen and others accused the criminals of unreasonably occupying their houses and converting them into foreign-style buildings, leaving them with nowhere to live, the whole audience shouted slogans, their voices piercing the sky. Businessman Wang Qu accused them of colluding with the Japanese寇 to rob and divide all the things that the merchants had stored in the Catholic Church. Zhang Hongliang angrily accused priest Ge of raping female parishioners under the guise of kneeling to scriptures. Ge once called two girls from the Zhangjia Mountain to his private room to kneel to scriptures and raped them for three days before releasing them. Many white-haired old women and young girls accused these war criminals of killing more than seventy of their relatives under the pretext of treating diseases as priests. Only 122 people had the opportunity to accuse at the meeting, and many who did not have time to speak submitted indictments. More than 20,000 people unanimously demanded that the government handle the matter according to law. Mayor Zhao of Heze City stated that the consistent policy of the liberated areas is to protect law-abiding foreign nationals, but war criminals who, under false pretenses and using various disguises, infiltrate the Chinese mainland and collaborate with the Japanese寇 to persecute the people will be given due sanctions according to law. The government, based on these specific facts of crimes and the opinions of the masses, has decided to deal with them according to law.
