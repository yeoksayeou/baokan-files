Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 17th—The Kuomintang reactionaries' insatiable aggression has enraged the millions of people in the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated areas, who have risen up to defend themselves. The movement to organize logistics to support the front lines and directly participate in the war and join the army has been widely launched in various places. In the Xuanjiabao self-defense battle in Taixing, central Jiangsu, more than 100,000 people participated in logistics and assistance. In Shuyang County, Huaihai District, more than 20,000 people have flocked into the logistics teams, and more than 1,400 young militia model teams have joined the war participation group. People in various places have been requesting to join the army. According to incomplete statistics from the fifth, sixth, and seventh sub-districts alone, more than 14,600 people have voluntarily requested to join the army. Wang Fengshan, the artillery hero of Lianshui, who was famous for leading the artillery team during the War of Resistance Against Japan, returned to his hometown to lead production after the ceasefire order was issued in January this year. This time, he could not bear the aggression of the reactionaries, so he had to put down his hoe and reorganize his old troops. They are repairing cannons and rushing to make landmines. Wang said: "If the reactionaries dare to step into the area we snatched back from the enemy and puppets with our blood and flesh, my cannons and landmines will explode above and below their feet." Huang Aiyu, an old militia member from Sheyang, said: "I have been a militia member for several years, and I am tired of carrying the Type 38 rifle. This time, the Chiang Kai-shek army is attacking, and I will seize an American gun from him to carry." Young women also actively participated in the militia. In Lianshui East County, nearly 2,000 women militia members have been developed in half a month. The people's armed forces have achieved great glorious results in the self-defense war. In addition to those previously reported, the militia in Jianan Township, Rugao, captured a total of 1,130 Chiang soldiers, and seized four war horses and two radio stations. Zhang Wanhe, the village chief of Shangling Village in the township, captured eight prisoners with his bare hands and seized a radio station. Wang, the village chief of Wangming Village in Rugao, seized two rifles with his bare hands in Dingyan (one of which was a "carbine"). On the way back, he found a Chiang soldier lying in a small ditch. Village Chief Wang shouted, "Dare to move! I'll kill you!" The Chiang soldier immediately handed over a light machine gun. A militia captain from a certain township in Zhangxu District, Tongxu County, led ten people to attack the Chiang army that invaded Lanshan on the Haizheng Highway on the fifth of this month. Taking advantage of the Chiang army's sleeping, they first moved away a machine gun. When the Chiang army was awakened and fled in panic, they killed ten and captured three, and seized more than ten rifles. The militia of Sanzhao Township, Sinan County, recovered three salt boats robbed by the Chiang army and killed or wounded three Chiang soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 17th—In the areas occupied by the Chiang army, the militia in various parts of Shandong widely launched sparrow warfare, blasting warfare, and landmine warfare, giving the invading army a strong blow. The militia in Jiaoxian and Jimo counties, in coordination with a small number of main forces, have been blocking two regiments of the 54th Army of the Chiang army that invaded the border area between the two counties for the past month. More than 100 landmines were laid on the Chiang army's invasion route, all of which exploded, killing or wounding 70 Chiang soldiers. In battles in various places, a total of more than 260 rifles, more than 1,200 pistol bullets, four small cannons, and three machine guns were seized. On the 30th of last month, the militia in Lincheng, southern Shandong, ambushed the Chiang army that invaded eastward from the city, luring them into a minefield. With a loud bang, 22 Chiang soldiers, including the company commander, were immediately killed. The militia in the Badou District of Boshan County, central Shandong, have been harassing more than 100 Chiang soldiers for days. In a surprise attack, they injured one Chiang army company commander and several soldiers. The Chiang army was enraged and launched a retaliatory attack. The militia used magical sparrow warfare to deal with them. The Chiang army searched everywhere in vain, and returned exhausted and frustrated.
