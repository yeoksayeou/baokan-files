　　Seven-Month Summary – On the Joint Statement of Marshall and Stuart, Editorial of Liberation Daily
    On the tenth of this month, Marshall and Stuart issued a joint statement, which, as Reuters reporters said, was Marshall "admitting that his efforts to promote peace and unity in China have practically failed." Since Marshall arrived in China in late December last year, at the request of the Moscow Three-Power Conference resolutions, he personally helped China conclude four major agreements: the January 10th Truce Agreement, the January Political Consultative Conference's five agreements, the February 25th Military Reorganization Plan, and the March 27th Northeast Truce Agreement. Now, seven and a half months after his arrival in China, he himself announced that the fundamental issues of the Kuomintang-Communist dispute "seem unlikely to be resolved." In fact, Marshall's efforts have not only failed today, but today's civil war is larger in scale and more brutal in nature than it was seven and a half months ago. Before Marshall arrived, Chiang Kai-shek used one million soldiers to fight the civil war, accounting for about 45 percent of his total military strength; now this force has increased to nearly 200 divisions, about two million people, accounting for about 85 percent of Chiang Kai-shek's total military strength. Before Marshall arrived, Chiang Kai-shek's army had 39 divisions equipped with American weapons; now there are 57 divisions, all of which are used on the front lines. In addition, there are air forces formed by American planes and navies formed by American ships. The current civil war is simply a cruel satire on the so-called "mediation" and "aid to China"!
    The Marshall-Stuart joint statement emphasizes the difficulty of reaching an agreement. Is it really that difficult to reach an agreement? Why were four extremely important agreements reached from January to March! These agreements were achieved because, on the one hand, the vast majority of the Chinese people wanted independence, peace, and democracy, and opposed traitorous civil war and dictatorship. Moreover, the Chinese people had tremendous power, and as long as there was no foreign military intervention, they would be able to achieve this task without any external assistance. On the other hand, China's warmongers, dictators, and traitors were isolated and faced many difficulties. Without the assistance of foreign imperialism, they would not be able to fight a civil war today. However, four months later, it was not only difficult to reach new agreements, but it was indeed becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the old agreements. The reason why it is becoming increasingly difficult is none other than the fact that American imperialist elements have given the Chinese reactionaries increasing amounts of various practical assistance. The more this assistance, the more arrogant Chiang Kai-shek becomes, and the lower Marshall's position becomes in front of Chiang Kai-shek. Despite the Communist Party's utmost concessions, it becomes increasingly difficult to reach and maintain agreements. Look at what the Marshall-Stuart joint statement says: the most difficult issue to resolve is none other than the issue of local government. The issue of local government is clearly a political issue. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference stipulate that "political disputes should be resolved through political methods," and that "in all recovered areas where there are disputes, the government shall temporarily maintain the status quo, and resolve them in accordance with Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the political section of the program of governance after the reorganization of the National Government." It can be seen that according to the PCC decision, there is absolutely no reason to resort to force for such issues. To launch a civil war for such issues is a groundless violation of the ceasefire order and the Three Foreign Ministers' resolution that "internal strife must be stopped." Marshall, watching the ceasefire order he personally participated in signing being violated so unreasonably, could only declare that it was impossible to resolve the matter. Marshall's position in Chiang Kai-shek's eyes is truly much lower than it was in January. As for the so-called garrison issue in the military reorganization plan in the Marshall-Stuart joint statement, it can be clearly seen how Chiang Kai-shek completely disregards Marshall. The military reorganization plan was also personally signed by Marshall, but Chiang Kai-shek now suddenly demands its overturning, demanding the occupation of vast areas originally designated for Communist troops to defend. Chiang Kai-shek openly told Marshall and Stuart that the Communist Party must accept five conditions before political negotiations would be allowed. The five conditions were: 1. Surrender the Soviet-Anhui border region. 2. Surrender the Jiaoji Railway. 3. Surrender Chengde and the area south of Chengde. 4. In the Northeast, retreat to Heilongjiang, Xing'an, and Nenjiang provinces and Yanji before October 15th. 5. Shandong and Shanxi provinces must withdraw from the areas occupied after June 7th (these areas were liberated by us from the puppet army after repeated ineffective concessions). Chiang Kai-shek said that otherwise, there would be no way to talk about civil war or government reorganization. It is not difficult to understand that Chiang Kai-shek's presentation of such absurd conditions to Marshall and Stuart is an act of insulting their personal integrity.
    Therefore, the direct cause of Marshall and Stuart's failure is of course the destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries, whom Marshall called "stubborn elements." The head of this group of Kuomintang reactionaries is none other than Chiang Kai-shek himself. This reactionary head, in the year since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, has torn up two agreements and launched two civil wars. Chiang Kai-shek was forced to reluctantly accept the truce agreement and the PCC resolutions in January, but immediately regretted it in February, instigating Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, Fang Zhi, and other C.C. reactionaries to use the guise of so-called "mass organizations" to violently attack democrats and pro-peace factions within the Kuomintang. This intimidation was deliberately done when Chiang Kai-shek himself left Chongqing. When the intimidation in February failed, the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session was held in March to oppose the PCC resolutions in the name of the "party" and to oppose all elements who supported the PCC and the military reorganization plan. When that failed, Chiang Kai-shek himself came forward on April 1st and gave a civil war speech at the National Political Consultative Council, completely overturning the agreements established from January to March. In late March and early April, political negotiations had in fact been destroyed. Replacing political negotiations was the outbreak of a large-scale civil war in the Northeast. Starting on June 7th, there was a 23-day ceasefire, followed by the launch of a large-scale civil war within the passes. On July 15th, Chiang Kai-shek went to Lushan to personally direct the civil war and evade peace negotiations. On August 5th, he put forward five absurd conditions that insulted the personal integrity of Marshall and Stuart. Chiang Kai-shek's goal is to maintain his autocratic dictatorship, which is of course a fatal blow to Marshall's peace efforts.
    However, why does Chiang Kai-shek, who obeys the will of the US government in everything, dare to undermine Marshall's peace efforts? In fact, it is not that Chiang Kai-shek dares to do so, but that the US government itself is undermining Marshall's work. On February 9th, the US State Department issued an anti-Soviet note to the Chinese government, which encouraged the Kuomintang reactionaries' anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-democratic movement. In March, the US military helped the Kuomintang transport three armies to the Northeast. In April, the US Navy stationed in China arbitrarily transported two Kuomintang armies to the Northeast. In June, the Kuomintang, with the help of the US Navy, was able to transport three more armies to Qingdao and Qinhuangdao. In total, during this period, the Kuomintang transported a total of eight armies to North China by sea and air with the help of the United States, one more army than during the period when the reactionaries Hurley and Wedemeyer were in power. Although the United States did not give the Kuomintang a large loan, the US State Department and Navy systems supplied the Kuomintang with as much as $1.3 billion in materials in the five months after Marshall arrived in China, according to Truman's statement. The US Navy sent two fleets to Qinhuangdao and Qingdao, ostensibly for "summer vacation," and its marines provoked the Eighth Route Army in many directions, leading the way for the Kuomintang. US Secretary of State Byrnes submitted a ten-year military aid to Chiang bill to the House of Representatives, and the State Department repeatedly stated that it would not withdraw troops from China. American imperialist elements are clearly aiding Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out the civil war without any scruples, using this method to rapidly turn China into an American colony. It is particularly noteworthy that the US Navy's actions could disregard the US government's plenipotentiary representative Marshall and act arbitrarily to give the Kuomintang authorities any assistance. The people of China and the United States and fair-minded people have repeatedly warned the US government authorities and the US Navy stationed in China in advance that this policy is incompatible with Marshall's peace activities and is bound to lead to Marshall's failure. Unfortunately, the US authorities still insisted on their erroneous policy, so that Chiang Kai-shek, with the active military assistance of the United States, completely disregarded any peace proposals. The cunning Chiang Kai-shek saw that the US government had two policies: one was to aid Chiang in the civil war, which was fundamental; the other was to help Chiang stop the war, which was a supplement or decoration. Therefore, he accepted the American cannons without hesitation and let the American doves go. However, Marshall himself is not without fault for the failure of the ceasefire work in China. Before General Marshall returned to the United States in March, his prestige was very high, because his behavior at that time was generally fair, he adhered to the principles of peace and democracy, and he had criticized the stubborn elements. Unfortunately, he only limited himself to verbal statements of criticism of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and did not even publicly criticize the American reactionaries and the arrogant navy. On the contrary, he sat idly by as the Kuomintang reactionaries constantly received actual assistance from the American reactionaries and did not stop them. Every time the Kuomintang reactionaries put forward new demands that would undermine the agreements that had been reached, he did not fight for the realization of the agreements that had been reached, but instead disregarded the agreements that had been reached and came to "mediate" again, thus making the Kuomintang reactionaries more and more unscrupulous, and Marshall's own position became lower and lower, and more and more despised by the Chinese and American reactionaries. On April 9th, before Marshall came to China again, Chiang Kai-shek had told American reporters that he was "determined to eliminate the Communist Party" and that "now it only depends on the attitude of the United States." All the foreign reporters in Chongqing at that time knew about Chiang Kai-shek's statement, and Marshall could not have known about it. In April, the US Navy stationed in China arbitrarily helped Chiang Kai-shek transport two armies to the Northeast. Upon hearing the news, the Communist Party representative immediately protested, but Marshall disregarded the Communist Party representative's protest at the end of April and raised this request again. The Communist Party representative protested again, but in early May, these two armies appeared in the Northeast. Then Marshall pointed out that two more government troops should be transported to Qinhuangdao and Qingdao to "take over the defense so that the US Marines could withdraw." The Communist Party protested, but the result was that three armies were transported there, and the Marines did not withdraw. In May, when fighting in Siping Street and Changchun, Marshall, on the one hand, allowed the US Navy to help Chiang Kai-shek transport troops to the Northeast, and on the other hand, said that if the Communist Party did not withdraw from Changchun, he would not conduct mediation. When the Communist Party expressed its willingness to exchange withdrawal from Changchun for a ceasefire in the Northeast, Marshall said that he was powerless. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek had completely torn up the Northeast Truce Agreement, and Marshall did not insist on a ceasefire in the Northeast, but expressed his willingness to insist on a ceasefire within the passes. By June 17th, Chiang Kai-shek not only demanded almost all nine provinces outside the passes, but also demanded the Soviet-Anhui border region, the Rehe-Chahar provinces, the Longhai and Jinpu railways, and the ports of Weihaiwei and Yantai within the passes. At this time, Marshall did not even insist on a ceasefire within the passes. American reactionary elements helped the Kuomintang reactionary faction to transport troops, equipment, and cooperate in combat step by step, Marshall allowed them to proceed, so that the Kuomintang reactionary faction put forward higher and higher demands: Changchun, Harbin, northern Jiangsu, the five demands, the entire liberated area, and made Marshall's peace activities encounter complete failure, which cannot but make people feel regret and pity!
    Thus, seven and a half months of "mediation" and "aid to China" produced a bigger civil war. People can't help but ask the US government: you sent people to help China conclude four major agreements, and then helped the Chinese reactionaries tear them up. Is this set of tricks a predetermined plan? If someone says that the US government's plan is not to implement the resolutions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference, but to deceive the world and buy time for the Chinese reactionaries to make full preparations for the civil war, then what satisfactory answer can the US government give other than repeating the tasteless old tune?
    Marshall can declare the failure of his own mission, but the Chinese people will never allow Chiang Kai-shek to carry out the civil war recklessly, nor will they allow the American reactionaries to continue to aid Chiang in the civil war for a long time, making the whole of China devastated. Without the United States "mediating" on the one hand and aiding Chiang on the other (in the name of "mediation," but in reality aiding Chiang), and letting the Chinese people take their own path, China could have achieved independence, peace, and democracy long ago. The Chinese people have the strength to solve their own problems. The US government's erroneous policy has created the biggest civil war in Chinese history. After creating such a civil war, if the US government wants to shirk its responsibility, not only will the Chinese people not agree, but the American people, the people of the world, and the governments of the other two countries that participated in the Moscow Conference, as well as all peace-loving United Nations, will never agree.
    For the US government to change its policy, abolish unilateral aid to Chiang, withdraw its naval, land, and air forces, and sincerely help the Chinese people and all parties to achieve peace and democracy, this is one way; to continue the past deceptive policy, "mediating" with one hand and helping Chiang against the Communists and the people with the other, this is another way. Which way to go, may the US government authorities think it over carefully, and may all democratic American people rise up and pay attention.

　　七个月总结——评马、司联合声明  解放日报社论
    本月十日，马歇尔与司徒雷登发表了联合声明，正像路透社记者所说，这个联合声明是马歇尔“承认其促成中国和平与团结之努方已实际失败”。从去年十二月下旬马歇尔到了中国以来，在莫斯科三国会议决议的要求下，他亲手帮助中国订立了四大协议：即一月十日停战协议，一月政治协商会议五项协议，二月廿五日整军方案，三月廿七日东北停战协议。现在在他到华七个半月之后，他却自己亲手宣布国共争论的根本问题“似已不可能获得解决”了。事实上，马歇尔的努力在今天不但失败而已，而且今天的内战，比之七个半月以前规模更大了，性质更残酷了。在马歇尔未来以前，蒋介石用来打内战的全力是一百万人，约占其总兵力百分之四十五；现在此项兵力增到差不多两百个师，约两百万人，约占蒋介石总兵力百分之八十五。在马歇尔未来以前，蒋介石的军队用美械装备的为三十九个师，现在则为五十七个师，而且全部用在前线，此外还有由美机编成的空军，美舰编成的海军。当前的内战，对于所谓“调处”与“援华”，简直是残酷的讽刺！
    马、司联合声明强调获得协议之难，获得协议果真是很难么？为什应从一月至三月能够获得四项极其重大的协议！这些协议之所以获得，是因为一方面中国广大的人民都要独立和平民主，反对卖国内战独裁，而且中国人民有巨大的力量，只要没有外国的军事干涉，就足以不靠任何外力的帮助实现这个任务。另一方面，中国的好战分子、独裁主义者、卖国汉奸是孤立的，困难很多的，没有外国帝国主义的援助，就莫想在今天打内战。但是，四个月以后，不但难于获得新的协议，甚至保持旧的协议也确是越来越难了。所以越来越难的原因，不是别的，正是因为美国帝国主义分子给了中国反动派以日益增多的各种实际的帮助。这种帮助越多，蒋介石就越来越蛮横，马歇尔的地位，在蒋介石面前就越来越降低；尽管中共方面作仁至义尽的让步，获得协议和保持协议也就越来越难。试看马、司联合声明中说，最难解决的问题不是别的，而是地方政权的问题。地方政权问题显然是一个政治问题，政治协商会议决议规定“用政治方法解决政治纠纷”，又规定“凡收复区有争执之地方，政府暂维现状，俟国民政府改组后，依施政纲领政治一项第六、第七、第八三条之规订解决之”。可见依照政协决定，为了这样的问题绝无动武的理由，为了这样的问题而发动内战，乃是毫无理由地破坏停战命令和三外长会议“必须停止内争”的决议。马歇尔眼睁睁看着他所亲自参加签字的停战命令受到如此无理的破坏，竟只能以声明无法解决了事，马歇尔的地位在蒋介石的眼睛里，比起一月份来，真不知低成什么样子了。说到马、司联合声明中的所谓整军问题中的驻地问题，那更可以明明白白看出蒋介石是怎样完全不把马歇尔放在眼里。整军方案也是马歇尔所亲自签字的，但蒋介石现在忽然要求推翻，要求占领原来决定由中共军驻防的广大地区。蒋介石公开告诉马歇尔和司徒雷登，要中共接受五个条件才允政治谈判，五条件为：一、让出苏皖边区。二、让出胶济线。三、让出承德及承德以南地区。四、东北在十月十五日以前退至黑龙江、兴安及嫩江等省与延吉。五、山东、山西两省须退出六月七日后占领地区（这些地区是我们在忍让再三无效之后，在伪军手中解放的）。蒋介石说，否则内战与改组政府都无从谈起。不难明白，蒋介石对马歇尔司徒雷登提出这样的荒谬条件，乃是侮辱马、司二人人格的行为。
    因此，马、司失败的直接原因，当然是马歇尔所称为“顽固分子”的国民党反动派的破坏，这批国民党反动派的头子不是别人，就是蒋介石自己。就是这个反动派头子，抗战胜利一年以来，已经撕毁两次协议，发动两次内战。蒋介石在一月间被迫勉强接受停战协议与政协决议，二月立即反悔，嗾使陈立夫、谷正纲、方治等Ｃ、Ｃ反动派以所谓“群众团体”的面目，暴力打击民主分子和国民党内的主和派，这一威吓是故意在蒋介石自己离开重庆时做的。二月的威吓不成，三月就开国民党二中全会，以“党”的名义来反对政协决议，和赞成政协的一切分子以及反对整军方案。又不成，四月一日就由蒋介石自己出面，在国民参政会上作了内战演说，完全推翻一月到三月成立的协议，三月末，四月初，政治谈判事实上已被破坏。代替政治谈判的，是东北大规模的内战爆发。六月七日起，停战二十三天，接着就在关内发动大规模内战。七月十五日，蒋介石上庐山亲自指挥内战和逃避和平谈判。八月五日提出侮辱马歇尔、司徒雷登人格的五项荒谬条件。蒋介石的目的在于维持他的专制独裁，这当然是对马歇尔的和平努力的致命打击。
    但是，一切遵从美国政府意旨的蒋介石，为什么敢于破坏马歇尔的和平努力呢？事实上，并不是蒋介石敢于如此，而是美国政府自己破坏马歇尔的工作。二月九日，美国国务院向中国政府发出反苏照会，这个照会鼓励国民党反动派的反苏反共反民主运动。三月间，美军帮国民党运三个军到东北。四月间，美国驻华海军又擅自运送国民党两个军到东北。六月间，国民党又借着美国海军的帮助，得以再运三个军到青岛及秦皇岛。总计这一时期，国民党由美国帮助，经海道及空中运到华北的军队，共达八个军，比赫尔利、魏德迈等反动派当权时期，还多运了一个军。美国虽然未给国民党以大借款，然而在马歇尔来华后五个月中间，经过国务院及海军系统供给国民党的物资，据杜鲁门声明，即达十三万万美金之多。美海军开了两个舰队到秦皇岛、青岛，名为“避暑”，其陆战队则多方向八路军挑衅，替国民党打先锋，美国国务卿贝纳斯向众院提出十年军事援蒋法案，国务院并一再声称不从中国撤兵，美国帝国主义分子显然肆无忌惮的援助蒋介石进行内战，用这个办法使中国迅速沦为美国的殖民地。特别值得注意的，是美国海军的行为，可以不顾美国政府全权代表马歇尔而擅自行动，给国民党当局以任何帮助。中美两国人民和公正人士，都曾再三预先警告美国政府当局与美国驻华海军的这种政策，是与马歇尔的和平活动不相容的，是必然要造成马歇尔的失败的。可惜美国当局仍然坚持自己的错误政策，以至蒋介石在美国军事积极援助之下，完全不把任何和平建议看在眼里，狡猾的蒋介石看出美国政府有两个政策：一个是援蒋内战，这是基本的；一个是助蒋停战，这是陪衬的或装饰的。因此，他毫不踌躇的接受了美国的大炮，而放了美国的鸽子。可是，对于中国停战工作的失败，马歇尔自己也不是没有错误。马歇尔将军在其三月回美以前，他的声望是很高的，因为他当时的行为，一般是公正的，他对于和平民主的原则是坚持的，他对于顽固分子是曾予以斥责的。但不幸的是，他对于国民党反动派仅仅限于口头的一二声明斥责，对于美国反动派及飞扬跋扈的海军，则甚至连公开的斥责也没有。相反的方面，他坐视着国民党反动派亲到美国反动派不断的实际的接济不去制止，他在国民党反动派每次提出破坏已成协议的新要求来时，并不为已成的协议之实现去奋斗，却不顾已成的协议而来重新“调处”，这样就使国民党反动派越来越肆无忌惮，马歇尔自己的地位就越来越低，越来越被中美反动派所看不起。四月九日，当马歇尔再度来华以前蒋介石已向美国记者表示，他自己是“决心要消灭共产党”，“现在只看美国的态度如何”。蒋介石的这种表示，当时重庆所有的外国记者都知道，马歇尔不会不知道。四月间，美国驻华海军擅自帮蒋介石运两个军去东北，中共代表闻讯，立即抗议，可是马歇尔于四月末不顾中共代表的抗议，再次提出此项要求，中共代表再次抗议，但五月初旬，这两个军已在东北出现了。接着马歇尔又指出要再运两个政府军到秦皇岛、青岛“接替防务，以便美海军陆战队撤退”，中共抗议，可是结果是运去了三个军，而陆战队并未撤退。五月间，四平街、长春作战时，马歇尔一面让美海军帮助蒋介石运兵东北，一面表示中共不撤出长春，则他也不进行调处；及至中共方面表示愿意以退出长春换取东北停战，马歇尔又表示无能为力。当时蒋介石已完全撕毁东北停战协议，马歇尔并不坚持东北停战，但对于关内停战表示还愿意坚持。到了六月十七日，蒋介石不仅提出关外要几乎全部九省，并且提出关内要苏皖边区、热察两省、陇海津浦两路、威海卫烟台两港。此时马歇尔连关内停战也不坚持了。美国反动分子一步步帮助国民党反动派而运兵，而装备，而配合作战，马歇尔任其进行，以至国民党反动派提出一步高一步的要求：而长春、而哈尔滨、而苏北、而五项要求、而全解放区，而使马歇尔的和平活动遇到完全失败，这不能不令人遗憾，令人惋惜！
    就这样七个半月的“调处”和“援华”，“调处”和“援助”出来一个更大的内战，人们不禁要问问美国政府：你们派人来帮助中国订立四大协议，又帮助中国反动派把它撕毁，这一套手脚是否是预定的计划。如果有人说，美国政府的计划并不是实行三国外长会议决议，而是欺骗世界，替中国反动派争取时间，来进行充分的准备以便进行内战；那末，美国政府除了重弹无味的老调，还能有什么令人满意的答复呢？
    马歇尔可以宣布他自己使命的失败，但中国人民决不允许蒋介石横行内战，也不容许美国反动派长久援蒋内战下去，把全中国弄得糜烂不堪。没有美国来一面“调处”，一面援蒋（“调处”其名，援蒋其实），而让中国人民自己走自己的路，中国早已可以获得独立和平民主。中国人民是有力量解决自己的问题的，美国政府的错误政策，已经造成中国历史上最大的内战。造成了这样的内战以后，美国政府要卸脱责任，不但中国人民不答应，而且美国人民、世界人民和参与莫斯科会议的其他两国政府，以及一切爱好和平的联合国也决不会答应。
    美国政府改变政策，废止片面援蒋，撤退海陆空军，诚意帮助中国人民及各党派实现和平民主，这是一条路；继续过去的欺骗政策，一只手“调处”，一只手助蒋反共反人民，这是又一条路，何去何从，愿美国政府当局三思之，更愿一切民主的美国人民起而注意。
