　　Shanxi Telecommunications Expert Yao Manqun Defects, Abandoning Post to Reach Our Area
    Cables Call on Former Students to Refuse Service to the Civil War
    [Our Yangcheng News] Yao Manqun, a Shanxi telecommunications expert and Major General Military Officer of the Second War Area Command, withdrew from the civil war in March, abandoned his post and left. After several months of travel, he has now arrived in our Taiyue Liberated Area. Mr. Yao is a well-known telecommunications talent in Shanxi, having served as the director of the Taiyuan Radio Station, the chief of the reporting section of the Taiyuan Radio Administration Bureau, a Major General Counselor of the Second War Area Command, and the head of the Jin-Sui Radio Training Institute and the Second War Area Communications Training Institute, etc., cultivating more than a thousand radio talents. As a patriotic soldier, Mr. Yao was deeply saddened by the national disaster caused by the civil war between Chiang and Yan, and resolutely abandoned his post and left, transferring to our liberated area. Mr. Yao has issued two circular telegrams, one calling on his former students to "immediately abandon wired and wireless work serving the civil war, and turn to the people's side to be loyal to the country and the nation, and to kill those traitorous villains." The other is to appeal to colleagues in the national communications business to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' treacherous acts of selling out sovereignty in exchange for aid from American imperialists and launching a full-scale civil war. "Colleagues who are engaged in fixed operations in the rear should refuse to participate in the civil war by going slow; colleagues who are forced to go to the front line should prepare equipment at any time and wait for the opportunity to transfer to the peaceful and democratic camp." He also said: "Manqun has followed Mr. Yan Xishan for nineteen years and has witnessed Yan colluding with Chiang to harm the country. He is deeply worried and has decided after careful consideration to break away from these murderous dictators and transfer to the CCP liberated area to work for China's independence, peace, and democracy. I sincerely hope that you will understand my intentions."

    【本报阳城讯】山西电讯专家、第二战区司令长官部少将军事姚满群氏，于三月间退出内战，弃职出走，辗转数月现已到达我太岳解放区。姚氏为山西有名电讯人材，历任太原无线电台台长、太原无线电管理局报务股长、二战区长官部少将参事、及晋绥无线电传习所第二战区通讯传习所长等职，先后培养出无线电人材千余人。姚为爱国军人，目睹蒋阎内战祸国，极为痛心，乃毅然弃职出走，转移至我解放区。姚氏顷发表通电两件，一为号召往日桃李，“立即放弃为内战服务的有线电、无线电工作，转到人民方面来效忠国家民族，戕彼汉奸贼子”。为呼吁全国通讯业务同仁，反对国民党反动派出卖主权、换取美帝国主义分子援助、掀起全面内战的滔天罪行。“在后面操固定业务的同仁，应以怠工来拒绝参加内战；被迫开赴前线的同仁，应随时准备器材，待机转入和平民主阵营。”又称：“满群随阎锡山氏十九年，目睹阎氏与蒋氏狼狈为奸，交相祸国，忧心如焚，思之再三，决心脱离这些嗜杀成性的独裁者，转入中共解放区，为中国的独立和平民主而工作。区区此心伏祈亮察。”
