　　Gaoyi, Sunjia Village
　　Children Investigate Special Agents
　　[This newspaper's Gaoyi dispatch] Under the call of the higher authorities to "prevent special agents from infiltrating and sabotaging, and to step up self-defense work in the border areas," the children of Sunjia Village in this county are very serious about their guard duty and inspections. From the 6th to the 9th of last month, four boys and girls under the age of thirteen, including Guo Jieying, uncovered three cases in a row. On the 6th, two packages of poison were found in the handlebars of a bicycle ridden by Zhang Yizi (from Beipu), a pedestrian traveling from north to south (note: from the Kuomintang area to the Liberated Area). On the 8th, a copied list of Communist Party members was found in the handlebars of a bicycle belonging to a pedestrian named ×× (a production worker from the third district of Xingtai). On the 9th, three secretly smuggled gold rings were found on Zhang Erhai, a woman from Xingtai who was going to Yuanshi. All the above-mentioned criminals have been handed over to the local government for processing.
