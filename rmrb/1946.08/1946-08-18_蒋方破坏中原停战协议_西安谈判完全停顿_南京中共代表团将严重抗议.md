　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th: A telegram from Xi'an reports: Ren Shishun, Lieutenant Colonel and CCP representative of the Thirty-Second Group negotiating the Central Plains ceasefire in Xi'an, was beaten by Chiang's side on the 6th of this month. Zhou Zijian, Director of the Xi'an Office of the 18th Group Army and representative of General Li Xiannian, was also robbed by Chiang's side. Since the Thirty-Second and Ninth Groups arrived in Xi'an, CCP representatives Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shishun and Colonel Xue Zizheng have been virtually imprisoned by special agents, with no freedom of movement. Chiang's side has also placed many restrictions on Mr. Zhou Zijian, General Li Xiannian's representative, preventing him from participating in mediation work. The 6th was the date stipulated by the three members of the Beiping Executive Headquarters for the Central Plains ceasefire agreement to take effect. On the afternoon of this day, when the group was discussing the issue of supplies for Li Xiannian's troops, the representatives of Chiang's side proposed the unreasonable solution that Li's troops must first be concentrated for verification before supplies would be resolved, but only funds would be issued, not food, and they would not be allowed to solve the problem locally. Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shishun stated that he could not accept this plan and requested that supplies be issued according to the general treatment of the National Army. Thereupon, Lu Jishi, the representative of Chiang's side, slammed the table and cursed, behaving in a tyrannical manner, and finally even raised a chair to attack. It only stopped after Xue Zizheng and Zhou Zijian persuaded him to stop. Then, adjutants and others from Hu Zongnan's department forced Mr. Zhou Zijian to leave immediately and warned that their safety would not be guaranteed after Mr. Zhou left. Mr. Zhou had no choice but to return to the 18th Group Army office. Unexpectedly, when passing the east entrance of Liangfu Street, they were suddenly surrounded by more than 20 armed special agents who had been lying in wait, with their pistols all pointed at Mr. Zhou's head, creating a menacing atmosphere. They robbed Mr. Zhou of his clothes, hats, shoes, socks, documents, ID cards, badges, armbands, valuables, etc., leaving only his undershirt and underpants. When the special agents were acting so recklessly in broad daylight in the downtown area, the police not only did not interfere, but instead ordered the onlookers to stay away. Currently, Mr. Zhou and the CCP representatives of the group can no longer contact the Yan'an radio station, nor can they contact Li Xiannian's troops through Yan'an, and they cannot contact each other. Their personal safety is no longer guaranteed, so the mediation work has come to a complete standstill. The CCP delegation here was extremely shocked and angry upon hearing the news and will lodge a serious protest with the Kuomintang.

　　蒋方破坏中原停战协议
    西安谈判完全停顿
    南京中共代表团将严重抗议
    【新华社南京十五日电】西安航讯：在西安谈判中原停战的三十二小组中共代表任士舜中校，于本月六日遭蒋方殴打，李先念将军的代表、十八集团军西安办事处周子健处长，亦受蒋方拦路洗劫。按自第三十二小组、第九小组先后到达西安后、中共代表任士舜中校，薛子正上校即被特务实际上监禁，毫无行动自由。蒋方对李先念将军的代表周子健氏，也多方禁阻其参予调处工作。六日，为北平执行部三委员规定中原停战协议开始生效之日，这天午后，当小组讨论李先念部给养问题时，蒋方代表提出李部必先集中点验，始准解决给养，但仍只发款项，而不发粮食，也不许渠就地解决的无理办法。任士舜中校当表示不能接受这一方案，要求按一般国军待遇，发给给养。乃蒋方代表卢济时竟拍案大骂，态度横暴，最后竟高举桌椅行凶，经薛子正、周子健两氏劝阻，才得停止。接着，胡宗南部副官等人，又强迫周子健氏立即退出，并警告说，周氏离开后，将不保障他们安全。周氏无法，只好返回十八集团军办事处。不料行经梁府街东口时，突有预伏的武装特务二十余人包围，手枪一齐对准周氏头部，声势汹汹，随将周氏衣帽鞋袜和随身所带文件、身份证、胸章、臂章、贵重物品等一齐抢走，只剩下衬衣衬裤。当特务白昼于闹市如此横行时，警察不仅毫不干涉，反令围观的群众避开。现周氏及小组中共代表都不能再与延安电台联络，更不能经延安与李先念部联络，彼此亦不能互相联络，本身安全且失保障，故调处工作已完全停顿。此间中共代表团闻讯，极为震愤，将向国民党方面提出严重抗议。
