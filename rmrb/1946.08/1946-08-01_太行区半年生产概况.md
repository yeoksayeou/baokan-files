　　Overview of Production in the Taihang Region for the First Half of the Year

    This year's large-scale production movement in the Taihang Region has gradually unfolded on the basis of the large-scale production movements of the past two years and the anti-traitor rent reduction (in new areas) and investigation and reduction (in old areas) this year, overcoming several difficulties. It has provided many new experiences and problems. The Taihang Xinhua Branch recently reported on the "Overview of the Organized Movement in the First Half of the Year" in the region. Excerpts are introduced below:    ——Editor

    This year, the popularization and improvement of organized effort in the old areas of Taihang have made significant progress. In terms of popularization: in the Xingxi area of the First District, 90% of the main labor force regularly participates in mutual aid; in the Ping Shun area of the Second District, the population organized accounts for 76.4% of the county's population, while in Licheng it accounts for more than 60% of the total population (including women involved in spinning); Shexian County in the Third District, which is a relatively poorly organized county in the old area, has organized villages accounting for 85%, totaling more than 9,600 households, which also exceeds any previous year. In terms of improvement: since last winter and this spring, small-scale cooperatives have developed significantly. Xingxi County alone has 356 small cooperatives, of which Dushu Village has six, with a capital of one million yuan. Licheng has 975 small cooperatives. Only three of the thirty administrative villages in Pingshun do not have them. The First District alone has 123. The production and development of these small-scale cooperatives are new creations of the masses based on their own needs and are a sign of the further improvement of mutual aid and cooperation. The value of small-scale cooperatives in the entire organized movement lies in the fact that they combine mutual aid groups of simple labor cooperation with general cooperatives of simple capital cooperation. It is a labor cooperation combined with capital cooperation, and it is the most flexible organizational form that combines agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the year. Although general labor mutual aid societies (such as Yue Wanshou's type, Zhang Xigui's type) have the content of small-scale cooperatives, they cannot be universally developed because of their large scale. Therefore, small-scale cooperatives have a broad path for development. The second budding creation in terms of improvement is the "Production and Construction Joint Cooperative" in Shangmatian, Zuoquan. The cooperative has five departments: agriculture, sideline occupations, business, health, and propaganda and education. The agriculture department has four production teams and twenty-three groups, with 156 full laborers and 110 half laborers, and also organizes temporary groups to study agricultural technology. The sideline occupations department leads textile, ironwork, transportation, and workshop units. The business department takes serving agriculture and sideline occupations as its basic task, and its business is to purchase raw materials and tools, and promote finished products. The health department leads a pharmacy, with two doctors. The propaganda and education department leads a private primary school and a bookstore. Yao Chengzhao, a bookstore employee, sells books and manages rural postal services in the morning, and serves as a volunteer teacher in the afternoon and evening, and is responsible for exchanging production information and experience. This comprehensive cooperative is an improvement in business and organizational form compared to Yue Wanshou's and Zhang Xigui's labor mutual aid societies, and is similar to Liu Jianzhang's comprehensive cooperative in Yan'an (Liu's comprehensive cooperative includes four types of business: production, consumption, transportation, and credit cooperation). Such comprehensive cooperatives can be referenced in large villages with a certain working foundation and cadre conditions; otherwise, it is not necessary to rigidly follow this pattern.

    After the masses in the new areas carried out the anti-traitor rent reduction, they have great enthusiasm for production, and they have made great achievements in getting organized. In Lincheng of the First District, all but six villages have mutual aid organizations, which have played a considerable role in the wheat harvest. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 1,200 mutual aid groups in 124 villages in Xingtai, with more than 9,000 men and women participating. In Heshi Village, Lucheng, 500 households have 500 full laborers participating in mutual aid, forming 24 plow-pulling groups, combining 40 livestock (there were more than 200 before the war), and completing the sowing of 50 hectares of land. In the five districts of Changzhi, more than 74,000 people participated in mutual aid, pulling plows to sow more than 230,000 mu of land, accounting for 69% of the total land sown in the five districts. After eight years of destruction by the enemy and puppet regimes, the new areas generally lack animal power. Without getting organized, it would be simply impossible to complete the sowing successfully. The examples of Changzhi and Lucheng are sufficient to illustrate the achievements and strength of getting organized in the new areas. This year is the first year for getting organized in the new areas. The focus is on mass development. It is a bit too early to talk about improvement today, and it is impossible to require everything to conform to the principles of getting organized. Attention should be paid to rectification, consolidation, and improvement on the basis of mass development. The opinion put forward by the First Special Commissioner's Office that "even if it is organized through administrative orders, it should not be canceled immediately with administrative orders" is also reasonable.

    The characteristic of getting organized in the border areas is to promote the experience of combining labor and military affairs for eight years. For example, Yucheng County, this spring, under the unified leadership of the Party, government, army, and people, mobilized 400 livestock in the third and fourth districts. Under the cover of the garrison soldiers and militia, it took five days of assault to complete the sowing of 40 li long, 15 villages, and 160 hectares of land in the border area. This large-scale experience of combining labor and military affairs is very valuable. However, this approach has a suddenness to it. Small-scale combinations of labor and military affairs in this village are still the regular and basic form. The main shortcomings of getting organized in Taihang in the first half of the year are: first, the development is uneven. Even in the old areas, there is unevenness between counties and counties, districts and villages, and in terms of quantity and quality. Among the 3,117 mutual aid groups in Licheng County, 1,037 are model groups, 1,526 are general groups, and 554 are temporary groups. Also, among the 1,230 groups in Zuoquan, 167 are model groups, 820 are general groups, and 243 are formal groups. Of the 128 villages in Shexian, 106 villages are organized, and there are still more than 20 villages (15%) that are blank. Changzhi and Heshun are better in the new areas, and other counties are worse. Secondly, not enough attention is paid to ideological education for getting organized. Many people in the new areas still think that participating in mutual aid is doing "official business." The old areas have a history of mutual aid for two or three years, but some groups are still based on a kind of "honor," and the blank areas do not even understand the mutual aid policy at all. Secondly, many mutual aid groups have outstanding problems, mainly the unfairness of equivalent value and insufficient democratic consultation to solve problems. This is due to insufficient publicity and education on the basic principles of "mutual assistance and mutual benefit" and democratic leadership. These will affect the popularization and improvement of getting organized. Third, the organizational leadership cannot keep up with the actual development of the movement. Some areas feel that getting organized cannot be improved, and the guiding principles are not clear. The main reason is that there is not enough research and summary. The development of small-scale cooperatives has been around for more than half a year, but some areas have not regarded it as a sign of the improvement of mutual aid and cooperation, which is one example.

　　太行区半年生产概况
    太行区今年的大生产运动，是在过去两年大生产运动和今年反奸减租（新区）查减（老区）的基础上，克服了若干困难，逐步开展起来的。其中提供了许多新的经验和问题。太行新华分社顷报导该区“上半年组织起来运动概况”。兹摘要介绍于后：    ——编者
    今年太行老区组织起来的普及和提高，均有显著的进步。普及方面：一分区邢西主要劳力经常参加互助的达百分之九十，二分区平顺组织起来的人口，占全县人口百分之七十六·四，黎城则占全人口百分之六十以上（纺妇在内），三分区涉县是老区中组织起来比较差的一个县，今年组织起来的村庄也达百分之八十五，共九千六百多户，也超过以往任何一年。提高方面：去冬今春以来，小型合作社有大量发展。邢西一县有三百五十六个小型合作社，其中杜树一村，就有六个，资本百万元。黎城有小型合作社九百七十五个。平顺三十个行政村只有三个村没有。仅一区就有一百二十三个。这种小型合作社的生产和发展，是群众根据自己需要的新创造，是互组合作提高一步的标帜。小型合作社在整个组织起来运动中的价值，在于它将单纯劳力合作社的互助小组，与单纯资本合作的一般合作社合而为一，它是劳力合作兼资本合作，又是农副业结合贯彻全年最灵活的组织形式。一般劳动互助社（如岳万寿式的，张喜贵式的）虽具有小型合作社的内容，但因为它规模较大，不可能普遍发展，因之小型合作社就有它宽广发展的道路。提高方面第二个萌芽创造，就是左权上麻田的“生产建设联合社”。该社共设农业，副业，营业，卫生，宣教等五部。农业部下设四个生产大队，二十三个组，拥有全劳力一百五十六个，半劳力一百一十个，还组织临时小组，研究农业技术。副业部领导纺织、铁工、运输、作坊等单位。营业部以服务于农业、副业为基本任务，它的业务为购买原料工具，推销成品等。卫生部领导药铺一座，有医生二人。宣教部领导民办小学一所，书店一所，书店职员姚成兆，上午卖书兼理乡村邮务，下午晚间即担任义务教员，并负责交流生产情况与经验，这种综合性合作社，在业务和组织形式上，较之岳万寿、张喜贵的劳动互助社，已经提高一步，与延安刘建章的综合合作社已相近似（刘之综合合作社包括生产，消费、运输、信用合作四种业务）。这种综合性合作社，凡有一定工作基础和干部条件的大村可以参考，否则不必硬照这个样子搞。
    新区群众反奸减租后生产劲头很大，组织起来已有很大成绩。一分区临城除六个村外，均有互助组织，麦收时已起了相当作用。邢台一百二十四个村据不完全统计，已有一千二百多互助组，参加男女劳力九千余人。潞城合室村五百户中有五百个全劳力参加互助，组成二十四个拉犁组，结合四十头牲口（战前有二百多头），完成五十顷地下种。长治五个区有七万四千多人参加互助，人拉犁下种二十三万余亩，占五个区全部下种土地百分之六十九。经过敌伪八年摧残，新区普遍缺乏畜力，没有组织起来，想胜利完成下种，简直是不可能的。长治潞城的例子，已足说明新区组织起来的成绩和力量。新区组织起来今年是头一年，其重点是大量发展，今天说提高还有点过早，要求它一切适合于组织起来的原则也不可能。应该注意在大量发展的基础上加以整顿，巩固与提高。一专署所提“即使是经过行政命令搞起来的，也不应该再用行政命令一下取消”的意见，也是有道理的。
    边沿区组织起来的特点，是发扬八年劳武结合的经验。例如榆次县，今春在党政军民统一领导下，动员三四两区四百头牲口。在营兵，民兵的掩护下，经五天突击，完成了边地四十里长、十五个村庄、一百六十顷地的下种。这种大规模劳武结合的经验是很可宝贵的。但这种做法带有一种突击性，本村的小型劳武结合，还是经常的、基本的形式，太行上半年组织起来的主要缺点，第一是发展不平衡，即以老区而言，县与县、区村与区村、数量上质量上，都是不平衡的。黎城全县三一一七个互助组中，模范的一○三七个，一般的一五二六个，临时的五五四个。又左权一二三○个组中，模范的一六七，一般的八二○，形式的二四三。涉县一二八村中组织起来的村庄一百○六个，尚有二十多个村庄（百分之十五）还是空白。新区以长治、和顺较好，其他县较差。其次是对组织起来的思想教育，注意不够，新区还有不少人认为参加互助是办“公事”，老区互助已有二三年历史，但有的组还是建立在一种“荣誉”上，空白区甚至还根本不了解互助政策。其次不少互助组中都有遗留问题，主要是等价不公，民主协商解决问题不够，这是由于对“互助互利”、民主领导的基本原则宣传教育不够，这些都会影响组织起来的普及和提高。第三，组织领导赶不上实际运动发展。若干地区感觉组织起来提不高，指导方针不明确，其主要原因是研究不够，总结不够。小型合作社的发展，已有多半年历史，然而若干地区并未把它当作互助合作的提高标帜来看，即是一例。
