　　Paris Peace Conference Day 5
    Representatives of Various Countries Continue to Speak
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Reports from various sources: On the fifth day of the Paris Peace Conference (August 2nd), the general debate continued. Polish representative Zymierski criticized those countries who, while claiming to emphasize the handling of the German question, were attempting to diminish the importance of the conference. He said, "We lost six million people, and we understand the importance of the German question better than any other country, but the time to deal with this issue is not yet ripe." The head of the Abyssinian delegation, Akililu Habte-Wold, then spoke, emphasizing Abyssinia's territorial claims against Italy. Belarusian representative Kiselev, in his speech, disagreed with the proposal of the Four Powers that Italian colonies be temporarily occupied by Britain until a final decision is reached. He said, "The continued occupation of any colony by Britain is interpreted by public opinion as Britain attempting to illegally influence these territories." At the plenary session on the 1st, Yugoslavian delegation leader Kardelj delivered a speech in which he praised the work of the Council of Foreign Ministers but disagreed with certain clauses of the draft peace treaty prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers, namely the decision regarding the fate of Trieste and the articles determining the Italo-Yugoslav border. The head of the Norwegian delegation, Lange, delivered a speech, pointing out the great work of the Council of Foreign Ministers and saying that the cooperation of the great powers is a guarantee of stable peace and security for the people of all countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: TASS reported: At the meeting of the Rules of Procedure Committee held on August 1st, Dutch representative Boetzelaer opposed Article 3 of the rules of procedure for the peace conference formulated by the Council of Foreign Ministers, which stipulated that it should only be composed of all countries that were at war with Germany. The Dutch representative argued that it should be composed of eleven countries. Molotov opposed the Dutch representative's proposal. In the vote, the Dutch representative's proposal was rejected, opposed by eleven countries. US representative Byrnes did not participate in the vote. The TASS reporter pointed out: The US representative's abstention from voting indicated doubt. A sentence often heard at the meeting was: Representatives believe that Byrnes would also indirectly support those who want to undermine the resolutions of the Council of Foreign Ministers, even though he participated when the Council of Foreign Ministers' resolutions were passed. At the morning meeting of the Rules Committee on the 2nd, Polish representative Giżycki requested that Poland have the right to vote in the committee participating in the formulation of the peace treaties with Italy and Hungary. Molotov supported Poland's request, but the representatives of the United States, Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand opposed it, and Poland withdrew its request. Subsequently, the representatives of New Zealand and the Netherlands put forward a motion to designate Bidault as the permanent chairman, but the Soviet Union insisted that the chairmanship be held by the Four Powers in rotation, changing every three days. The outcome of this dispute is unknown.

　　巴黎和会第五天
    各国代表继续发言
    【新华社延安三日电】各方报导：巴黎和会的第五天（二日），大会仍举行一般发言。波兰代表兹莫夫斯基抨击那些声言强调处理德国问题的国家，试图减弱和会的重要性，他说：“我们丧失六百万人民，我们比其他任何国家更了解德国问题的重要，但处理此问题的时间还没有成熟”。阿比西尼亚代表团长阿克利伦继起发言，强调阿国对意的领土要求。白俄罗斯代表基什列夫演说时，不同意四强下列的建议，即在达到最后决定之前，意大利殖民地暂时由英国占领。他说：“英国之继续占领任何殖民地，都被舆论解释为英国企图非法影响这些领土”。在一日的全体会议上，南斯拉夫代表团长卡德尔发表演说，他赞成外长会议的工作，但不同意外长会议准备的和约草案的某些条文，即关于的里亚斯特命运的决定，以及确定意南边界的条文。挪威代表团长兰吉发表演说，指出外长会议的巨大工作，并谓各列强合作是各国人民稳定和平与安全的保证。
    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社报导：八月一日举行的程序规则委员会会议上，荷代表波次雷反对外长会议所制订之和会程序规则的第三条，该条规定只能由一切曾与德国处于战争状态的各国组成之，而荷代表则主张由十一国组成之，莫洛托夫反对荷代表提议。在表决时，荷代表的提议被否决，反对者由十一国，美代表贝纳斯未参加表决。塔斯社记者指出：美代表不参加表决，表示怀疑，会议上常听见这样的一句话：代表们认为贝纳斯也会间接拥护那些想破坏外长会议决议的人，但外长会议的决议在通过时是有他参加的。程委会二日晨的会议上，波代表著名钢吉琴家吉尔生，要求波兰在参加制定对意匈和约委员会中有表决权，莫洛托夫支持波兰的要求，但美、英、澳、荷、新西兰代表反对，波兰遂撤回其要求。其后新西兰、荷兰代表又提出一议案，指定比道尔为永久主席，但苏联坚持由四强轮流担任主席，三天一换。此争论结果不悉。
