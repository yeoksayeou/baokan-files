　　Improving Ideology Improves Master-Apprentice Relations
　　Dawn Silk Weaving Factory Increases Quality
　　Beautiful Silk in High Demand

　　[Our newspaper, Yangcheng news:] Since the Yangcheng "Dawn Silk Weaving Factory" improved master-apprentice relations, production efficiency has greatly increased, product quality is good, sales are fast, and everyone's life has improved. Managers, workers, and apprentices are all very happy. The "Dawn Silk Weaving Factory" was prepared in March of last year and started work in May. At that time, there were five skilled workers and five apprentices. In addition to the factory preparing some of the tools, many were brought by the workers themselves as equity investments. The factory was responsible for repairing any damage, and the tools remained the property of the original owner. Everyone was very satisfied with this. However, the skilled workers were unwilling to teach their skills to the apprentices, resulting in low work efficiency and poor products. They worked until the end of the year without earning a penny. After reviewing and improving their ideology, they proposed "Apprentices are everyone's apprentices, and masters are everyone's masters," calling on apprentices to respect their masters, learn the strengths of each master, and pay attention to timely praising the advantages of each skilled worker. Recently, a New Heroism movement has been launched, and the reward method is that, in addition to the amount of silk reeled, the quality of reeling, the amount of weaving, and the uniformity of the lines, the skilled workers are also judged on how actively they help the apprentices. Apprentices are judged not only on the quality of their winding but also on their efforts to learn and help others. They are divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D, and awarded prizes monthly. This has greatly improved the relationship between skilled workers and apprentices, and greatly increased production efficiency and production technology. Therefore, the factory could only produce some small handkerchiefs and mosquito netting bottoms last year, but now it can weave all kinds of beautiful patterned silk fabrics, and is also trying to weave some semi-cotton, semi-silk socks, vests, and other daily necessities. It is said that the sales are very good, and there is a large demand. In the first half of this year alone, from January to June, they earned 200,000 yuan (the factory's capital is also only 200,000 yuan). The living standards of workers and apprentices have also been improved as a result. Usually, they have three meals a day, but when reeling silk, they increase to five meals. The factory provides apprentices with clothes, shoes, and socks, and skilled workers receive a monthly wage of one *shi* of rice at market price in addition to their meals.

　　打通思想改善师徒关系
    曙光丝织厂质量俱增       
    美丽绸缎供不应求
    【本报阳城讯：】阳城“曙光丝织厂”自改善师徒关系后，生产效率大为提高，产品质量好、卖的快，大家生活改善了，经理、工人、学徒都很高兴。“曙光丝织厂”是去年三月间筹备，五月里开工的，当时共有五个技术工人和五个学徒，工具除工厂等筹备一部分外，很多都是工人自己带来作价入股的，损坏了由工厂负责修理，工具仍归原主所有，在这上面大家都很满意。只是技术工人不愿把自己的技术教给学徒，致使工作效率提不高，产品又很差，一直干到年底也没有赚一个钱。经检讨打通思想后，提出“徒弟是大家的徒弟，师傅是大家的师傅”，号召学徒要尊重师傅，学习每个师傅的长处，并注意及时表扬各个技术工人的优点。最近又开展了新英雄主义运动，订出的奖励办法是，技工除丝打得多、打得好、织得多、线条匀外，还要看帮助徒弟积极不积极作标准，学徒除轮线好坏外并以努力学习帮助别人为标准，分甲乙丙丁四等，一月一评奖，这样便大大的改善了技术工人与学徒的关系；也大大地提高了生产效率与生产技术，故该厂去年只能出一些小手绢、小网罗底等，现在却已能织出各式美丽花格的绸缎了、并且正在试织一些半棉半丝袜子、背心等日用品，据说销路很广，大有供不求之势，仅今年正月至六月半年内便赚了廿万元（该厂资本也只有二十万元）。工人学徒生活待遇也因而提高了，平常三顿饭，打丝时便增至五顿饭，学徒衣服鞋袜均由工厂供给，技术工人除吃外，每月还按市价发一石米的工钱。
