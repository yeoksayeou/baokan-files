　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on Chiang Kai-shek's letter to the compatriots nationwide on the 13th, saying: Every time a holiday comes, out comes a Chiang Kai-shek's "eight-legged essay" filled with lies, shameless, smelly and long, which is truly a disgrace to the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek's demobilization is "demobilizing" the people to starvation, "demobilizing" national industries to closure, "demobilizing" China to a colony, "demobilizing" the entire country to civil war, "demobilizing" politics to overt and covert assassinations, "demobilizing" 85 percent of the army to fight the liberated areas, "demobilizing" Yunnan troops to the Northeast, "demobilizing" Southern troops to the North to fight civil war, and "demobilizing" tens of thousands of officers from miscellaneous and non-Zhejiang origins to beg on the streets. This is what Chiang Kai-shek calls "resolutely not abandoning his responsibility to safeguard national administrative sovereignty and protect the lives and property of the people." Wherever Chiang Kai-shek's transportation can reach, he can most thoroughly carry out this kind of "demobilization" work of killing, cannibalizing, economic collapse, and colonization. And the reason why he demands that his transportation be unimpeded is to transport his troops to achieve all his "demobilization" i.e. the purpose of civil war. Chiang Kai-shek's "usual democratic method" is a "fascist republic" style of democracy like the Japanese Emperor plus Hitler plus Mussolini. The manifestation of this kind of democracy is nineteen years of civil war, killing like hemp, the Kunming Massacre, the Jiaochangkou Massacre, and the assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, etc. Only by abolishing his kind of "democracy," that is to say, abolishing the fascist oligarchy dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic capital group, can there be true democracy. Chiang Kai-shek has the "responsibility" to maintain his own fascist oligarchy dictatorship and oppose the people's demands for peace and democracy. If Chiang Kai-shek insists on this to the end, then the Chinese people also have the responsibility to abolish Chiang Kai-shek's fascist oligarchy dictatorship and realize the people's democracy. The Chinese people must have the right to eat and the right to speak. The Chinese Communist Party will definitely stand with the people to the end and never retreat. Chiang Kai-shek, remember this well, if he dares to act arbitrarily, insists on having the people in the liberated areas massacred by you, insists on having the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continue to starve to death by the millions, insists on having democratic people throughout the country assassinated and openly killed by you, insists on a fascist dictatorial constitution, insists on convening a one-party-dominated pseudo-"National Assembly" prepared to transition from fascist tutelage to fascist "constitutional government," then the people will definitely have ways to abolish all of this. Chiang Kai-shek also told American reporters on April 9, "I have made up my mind to eliminate the Communist Party." Before going to Lushan this time, Chiang Kai-shek once said, "Watch me succeed in suppressing the Communists within a year," but he did not dare to say this publicly in the letter to the people. Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly sabotaged the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and ignored the repeated proposals not to hold the PCC. Chiang Kai-shek deleted the four characters "army reorganization" from the "Basic Plan for Army Reorganization and Unification of the Communist Army into the National Army" and only demanded the implementation of the "Plan for Unifying the Communist Army into the National Army." These are all called "adhering to the agreement." Chiang Kai-shek does not dare to mention the Northeast Truce Agreement of March 27, does not dare to mention the four promises he himself made, and does not dare to mention the great famine and economic collapse under the rule of the Kuomintang. The reason why Chiang Kai-shek is doing this is a manifestation of a guilty conscience and a manifestation of a deep crisis. In order to oppose the people, in order to pursue civil war and dictatorship, Chiang Kai-shek has given away various sovereign rights of China to American imperialism in order to obtain foreign aid. He thinks this is his "success." However, Chiang Kai-shek and his murderous and cannibalistic heinous government are extremely isolated throughout the country and are being opposed by the people of the whole country. Relying on his foreign daddy alone will not work! The Xinhua News Agency reporter said: Chiang Kai-shek is already sixty years old. How much national sovereignty has he sold? How many of his own compatriots has he killed? How much has he made from national crises and non-national crises? What do the Chinese people think of Chiang Kai-shek and the Chiang government? Don't Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk understand this?! At the Political Consultative Conference, the democratic parties were magnanimous and wanted to allow Chiang Kai-shek to have a good end. As long as he turned over a new leaf, he could be forgiven for the past. He lightly abandoned this good opportunity and was determined to drill into the cesspool. It is truly regrettable!

### 新华社记者评蒋介石谎言骗人

　　新华社记者评蒋介石谎言骗人
    【新华社延安十五日电】新华社记者评蒋介石十三日告全国同胞书说：每逢一个节日，就出来一篇满纸谎言无耻又臭又长的蒋八股，实是中国人民的耻辱。蒋介石的复员，是拿人民“复”到饿死，把民族工业“复”到关门，把中国“复”到殖民地，是把全国“复”到内战，把政治“复”到明杀与暗杀，是把百分之八十五的军队“复”来打解放区，把云南军队“复”到东北，把南方军队“复”到北方打内战，把杂牌的和非浙江人的军官成千成万“复”到街头去讨饭。这些就是蒋介石所说“决不能放弃其维护国家行政主权与保护人民生命财产安全的责任”。凡是蒋介石的交通所能够到达的地方，他就能够把这种杀人、吃人、经济崩溃、殖民地化的“复员”工作做得最为彻底。而他所以要求他的交通畅通，就是为的运送他的军队，以达到他这一切“复员”即内战之目的。蒋介石的“通常民主方式”，是日本天皇加希特勒加墨索里尼“法西斯共合国”式的“民主方式”。这种民主的表现，就是十九年的内战，就是杀人如麻，就是昆明惨案，较场口惨案和李闻暗杀案等等。只有取消他的这种“民主”，即是说，取消蒋介石官僚资本集团的法西斯寡头独裁，才会有真正的民主。蒋介石有“责任”维持他自己的法西斯寡头独裁和反对人民的和平民主要求，这一点蒋介石坚持到底，中国人民就也有责任去取消蒋介石的法西斯寡头独裁和实现人民的民主。中国人民一定要有饭吃的权利，说话的权利。这一点中国共产党一定与人民一起坚持到底，决不后退。蒋介石牢牢记住吧，如果他敢于一意孤行，一定要解放区的人民受你屠杀，一定要国民党统治区的人民成百万的继续饿死，一定要全国民主人士受你暗杀和明杀，一定要一个法西斯独裁宪法，一定要召开一党包办、准备由法西斯训政到实行法西斯“宪政”的伪“国民大会”，那么人民是一定有办法去取消这一切的。蒋介石还在四月九日就对美国记者说：“我已经下决心消灭共产党”。蒋介石此次上庐山之前，曾经表示“一年内看我剿共成功”，可是在告民众书里不敢公开这样说。蒋介石一连串的破坏政协决议，连续不再开政协的提议也不理，蒋介石把“关于军队整编及统编中共军队为国军之基本方案”，删去了“军队整编”四字，只要求执行“统编共军为国军的方案”，这些都叫作“信守协议”。蒋介石不敢提三月二十七日的东北停战协议，不敢提他自己亲口说的四项诺言，不敢提国民党统治下的大饥荒和经济崩溃。蒋介石所以如此，是作贼心虚的表现，是危机深重的表现。蒋介石为着反对人民，为着内战与独裁，把中国各种主权断送给美国帝国主义，以取得外援，他认为这是他的“得计”。但是，蒋介石和他的这个杀人吃人的万恶政府，在全国已极端孤立，正遭受到全国人民的反对，光靠洋爸爸也不顶事！新华社记者说：蒋介石已经六十岁了，卖了多少国家主权，杀了多少自己的同胞，发了多少国难财和非国难财，中国人民对蒋介石和蒋政府作何感想，难道蒋介石等辈还不明白？！政治协商会议上，各民主党派宽大为怀，想让蒋介石得个善终，只要他革面洗心，就可以不咎既往，此种良机轻轻抛弃下，决心要往粪坑里钻，真是不胜遗憾之至！
