Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 3rd: The masses, guerrillas, and militia in the newly occupied areas of Jinzhong Plain by 阎 [Yán] 伪 [wěi - puppet] are actively cooperating with the Eighth Route Army to launch encirclement struggles against 阎 [Yán] 伪 [wěi - puppet] strongholds. Since mid-July, they have successively removed many important strongholds, including Shiyong Town and Xiaqu Town in Wenshui, Renyan and Jicheng Town in Fenyang, Kangning Fort on the Pingyao-Fenyang Road, Zuojiabao west of Pingyao City, and Sanquan Town on the Fen(yang)-Li(shi) Road. They are now continuing to besiege other villages and towns still occupied by the 阎 [Yán] army. In the battles, they repeatedly inflicted heavy casualties on the 阎 [Yán] army's 40th and 70th Divisions and the puppet army's 9th Column, capturing more than 200 people. Currently, the democratic government is actively carrying out relief work in the above-mentioned areas to help the masses restore production.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: On the 27th of last month, the New Fourth Army, in the Yugou self-defense campaign, more than 100 li southeast of Xuzhou on the northern Jiangsu-Anhui front, annihilated the entire invading 92nd Division of the 90th Army of the Chiang army. The verified battle results are as follows: More than 1,000 enemy generals were killed or wounded (previously mistakenly reported as more than 500). The 92nd Division's Deputy Division Commander Xi Shengkai (previously the surname Xi was mistaken as Shen), Division Chief of Staff Liu Lishen, 274th Regiment Commander Liu Dianjun, 275th Regiment Commander Wang Shaotang, and more than 3,000 other officers and soldiers laid down their arms. It was previously reported that the division commander Ai Di was captured, but it has been verified that it was the division chief of staff Liu Lishen. The captured items include 2 rocket launchers, 6 mountain guns, 2 anti-tank guns, 20 mortars, and more than 100 light and heavy machine guns.
