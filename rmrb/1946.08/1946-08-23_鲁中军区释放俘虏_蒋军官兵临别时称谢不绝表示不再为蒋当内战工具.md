Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 19th: The Luzhong Military Region released over 250 Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers captured in self-defense battles, giving each person 1,000 yuan in legal tender for travel expenses. For those who were injured and had not yet recovered, the masses were mobilized to carry them on stretchers. Chiang's officers and soldiers thanked them repeatedly upon departure, expressing that they would no longer serve as Chiang Kai-shek's tools for civil war. These Chiang's soldiers mostly belonged to the American-equipped 73rd Army and were captured in battles around the Zibo mining area. Although the fascist elements within the Kuomintang can deceive their officers and soldiers for a time, once they come into contact with the people's army, they are shown to be weak and powerless in the face of justice. In the West Slope defense battle, Chen Lequan, the company commander of the Second Company of the First Battalion of the 577th Regiment of Chiang's 73rd Army, laid down his arms after being surrounded and hailed by the Eighth Route Army. Li Huiwen, the political commissar of the Eighth Route Army division, personally talked to them, analyzed the current situation, pointed out a bright future for them, and took care of their lives in every possible way. Chen Lequan said with emotion, "The Eighth Route Army, from top to bottom, treats me so well that even my own parents could not take such good care of me." In the same battle, the platoon leader of the machine gun company of the first battalion of the same regiment was pressed into the rubble due to the collapse of the pillbox. A squad of Eighth Route Army soldiers immediately stepped forward to rescue him, warning each other, "We would rather hit our own feet than injure the prisoner's head." After the platoon leader was pulled out, he continued to curse, but Li Xinde, the Eighth Route Army company commander, patiently explained the domestic situation to him, pointed out that there was no way out for the civil war, and the medical orderly kindly bandaged his wound. The platoon leader finally sighed in shame, burst into tears, and said with grief, "We have been sold out by Chiang Kai-shek and mistakenly regarded the Eighth Route Army as the enemy. It's really too wrong." Another soldier of the same regiment, who was injured in the leg, was deceived by the reactionaries and took off his watch to give to Feng Jiayan, an Eighth Route Army soldier who was receiving prisoners on the front line, asking him to protect his life. Feng Jiayan politely declined and told him that the Eighth Route Army treated prisoners well and bandaged his wound. Deeply moved, he immediately dug out his hidden American rifle and handed it over to Feng Jiayan, saying, "This is Chiang Kai-shek's gun for fighting the civil war. It will harm others and ourselves if we hold it in our hands."

　　鲁中军区释放俘虏
　　蒋军官兵临别时称谢不绝表示不再为蒋当内战工具
    【新华社临沂十九日电】鲁中军区释放在自卫战中擒获之蒋军官兵二百五十余人，每人发给路费法币一千元，对受伤未愈者则动员民众以担架辗转抬送，蒋军官兵于临别时均称谢不绝，并表示不再为蒋介石充当内战工具。该等蒋军多隶属美械化之七十三军，系于淄博矿区一带战斗中被俘。国民党内法西斯分子虽能欺骗其官兵于一时，但当其一经与人民军队接触，即在正义前显出脆弱无力。在西坡保卫战中，蒋军七十三军五七七团一营二连连长陈乐泉被围后，经八路军喊话而放下武器，八路军师政委李辉文亲自和他们谈话，分析目前时势，为其指出光明前途，生活上照顾得无微不至。陈乐泉感动的说：“八路军上上下下都对我这样好，就是亲生父母也不能照顾得如此周到。”同一战斗中，该团一营机枪连一排长，因炮楼倒塌被压入乱石中，八路军一个班战士当即上前抢救，互相警告说：“宁可砸着自己脚，可别砸伤俘虏头。”该排长被扒出来后，尚叫骂不绝，但八路军连长李心德耐心地为其解释国内形势，指出内战绝无出路，卫生员则亲切地为他包扎伤口，该排长终于连叹惭愧，抱头痛哭，并悲愤地说：“我们叫蒋介石出卖了，误把八路军当作敌人，真太不应该。”另一腿部受伤之该团士兵，因受反动派蒙蔽，将手表摘下送给火线上招待俘虏的八路军战士冯家言，要求保护其生命安全，经冯家言婉辞谢绝，告以八路军优待俘虏，并为其包扎伤口。因其深受感动，立即扒出其藏匿之美式步枪送交冯家言，并说：“这是蒋介石打内战的枪，拿在我们手里害人又害己。”
