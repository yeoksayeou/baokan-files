　　Chiang Kai-shek is Again Deploying Troops
    Planning a Large-Scale Invasion of Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
    [Lanzhou Front, 24th dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek has recently been greatly deploying troops and generals again, deploying a large-scale offensive against our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. Our army has seized an urgent order with Chiang Kai-shek's handwriting, instructing the 30th and 40th divisions originally assembled in northern Henan and half of the 51st division originally defending in Anhui to jointly attack Daokou Town, Hua County; at the same time, directing the 47th, 43rd, and 3rd divisions, etc., to quickly move to Fengqiu and attack Dongming via Changyuan. The 122nd Brigade of the 47th Division, led by Brigade Commander Zhang Xianwu, took a special train from Xuchang in central Henan northward on the 15th and arrived in Fengqiu on the 18th. Li Qixiang's unit of the 47th Division moved north from Xinyang in southern Henan on the 13th and has now arrived at Qiyi Station on the side of the Xinbian Road, and its advance troops have entered Fengqiu. According to Dongming military intelligence, a regiment of the 3rd Division has also arrived in Changyuan County, and is now actively conscripting men, seizing grain, and rushing to repair fortifications. Chiang's aircraft have also been dispatched for days to bomb Dongming, Dingtao, Cao County and other places. Dongming County alone was bombed by Chiang's aircraft four times from the 18th to the 21st. Judging from the Chiang army's attempt, it is to penetrate deep into the heart of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region with a main force to contain our army's counter-offensive on the Longhai Line, but some of the invading Chiang army, awed by the might of our army on the Longhai Line, are demoralized and panicked.
    [Lanzhou Front, 22nd dispatch] Dong Lingwu, the Kuomintang Magistrate of Lanfeng County, who was properly protected by us during the Lanfeng Liberation Campaign, has recently revealed the tyranny of the Chiang regime based on his personal experience, stating that the entire Lanfeng County has more than 96,000 people, with an average of only 2.3 mu of land per person. Because the Yellow River has changed its course three times across the county, thousands of acres of fertile land have been turned into gravel. Whenever planting is done, fresh soil must be turned out from under the sand before sowing. In the best years, each mu of land can only yield 30 jin of grain. In addition, the people have suffered unspeakably from the eight years of Japanese rule. However, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to launch a reactionary and traitorous civil war, disregarded the life and death of the people of Lanfeng and amassed troops along the Longhai Line. This spring, there was a severe shortage of grain, and the Chiang army dispatched a requisition of 400,000 jin of grain at a time. Wealthy households fled one after another, and the entire burden fell on the lower and middle classes. After the summer harvest, a "requisition one, borrow one" system was implemented, and the people's grain was almost completely taken away. However, the price paid for this requisitioned and borrowed grain was only 40% or less of the market price. Therefore, the peasants' burden was actually equal to 250% of the original requisitioned amount. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called order to exempt the people in the recovered areas from land tax is just a worthless piece of paper. Before the liberation, a pound of steamed buns had risen to over 300 yuan, a pound of peanut oil to 960 yuan, and a pound of firewood to 50 yuan. Lanfeng people really got their saviors this time when they celebrated the liberation.

　　蒋介石又在调兵遣将
    图大举进犯我冀鲁豫
    【陇海前线廿四日电】蒋介石最近又在大肆调兵遣将，部署对我冀鲁豫区大的进攻，我军曾缴获蒋手谕之紧急命令一份，指示其原在豫北集结之卅师、四十师及原在安徽防守之五十一师各用一半兵力，联合进攻我滑县道口镇；同时指挥四十七师、四十三师、第三师等部，迅速开至封邱，经长垣扑我东明。四十七师之一二二旅在旅长张显伍率领下，十五日乘专车自豫中之许昌向北开进，十八日已赶至封邱。四十七师李奇享部十三日自豫南信阳北开，现已到达新汴路侧之齐益车站，其先头部队已进入封邱。又据东明军息：第三师一个团并已开抵长垣县城，现正积极抓丁抢粮赶修工事中。蒋机并连日出动，轰炸我东明、定陶、曹县等地，东明县城仅十八至二十一四日内，遭蒋机轰击达四次。综观蒋军企图，系以主力一部深入我冀鲁豫腹心地区，以牵制我军在陇海线上的反攻，但部分进犯之蒋军慑于陇海我军神威，士气沮丧，恐慌万状。
    【陇海前线廿二日电】此次兰封解放战中，为我妥为保护的国民党兰封县长董灵伍，顷就其亲身经历揭露蒋政权之暴政称：兰封全县九万六千余人，每人平均仅占有土地二亩三分，因横贯县境之黄河三次改道，致使千顷良田尽为砂砾，每当耕种，必须从沙下翻出鲜土始能下种，最好年景每亩地也仅能收三十市斤粮食。加以日寇八年统治，人民已不堪其苦，然蒋介石为发动反动卖国内战，不顾兰封人民死活，大军云集于陇海沿线。今春粮食奇缺，蒋军一次即派征借粮四十万斤，富户相率逃避，全部负担都落在中下层人民身上。夏收后，又实行“征一借一”制，老百姓粮食几乎被囊括一空，而此等征借粮，仅按市价百分之四十以下给价，因此农民的负担实际等于征借原额百分之二百五十，蒋介石所谓免征收复区人田赋之命令，仅是一纸空文。截至解放前蒸馍一斤已涨至三百元以上，花生油一斤九百六十元，柴一斤五十元。此次庆获解放，兰封人民真是得到了救命恩人。
