The main task of propaganda work in carrying out the movement is to ignite the fire and create a large-scale mass emancipation movement. Wu'an has gained the following three experiences in this regard:

I. Concentrate the wisdom of the masses and use their own words to awaken them.

1. Use the vivid words of the masses to break down their ideas of conscience, fate, and sentiment. For example, an old farmhand from Yunjialing said: "I built a house for the shopkeeper and went blind. Not only did he not give me wages, but he didn't even give me food and kicked me out. I suffered in his house for many years. Is this conscience?" Tenant farmers in Chengbei Township discussed fate and said: "If we seize the grain and don't hand it over to the landlord, let's see if he gets poor. If he can get poor too, then it's not good fate." They also said: "In the past, poor people were not as valuable as a handful of wheat straw to the rich. The landlords squeezed us like they were trying to get four ounces of oil out of buckwheat husks. What sentiment is there?" Regarding who depends on whom for a living, a landlord from Boyan said: "Everything you stand on and everything above you is mine." The tenant farmers retorted: "If it weren't for us outside households, the landlord wouldn't even have cool water to drink." In the joint urban-rural struggle, the landlord Chang Xinghan admitted: "I overcharged for food and tea money and bought land." The tenant farmers said: "No wonder the landlords can get rich, they overcharge us and buy land to exploit us again." Regarding the idea of changing the world, activists said: "If we turn ourselves around and buy guns, we will shoot anyone who comes to sabotage us. If we fight, the Eighth Route Army will come to help us." "Our hatred is the government's hatred, and the government will definitely stand up for us." "There are many of us poor people, if we organize the militia well, what are we afraid of if the reactionaries attack?"

2. Turn the words of the masses into slogans for mass action. "Rent reduction is reducing your own [burden]," "Overthrowing rent is overthrowing resentment," "Accounts must be settled clearly, and reasons must be explained fully," "If we want something, we all go together, so they have no way to retaliate," "Don't be afraid of being fanned with a fan even if your head is broken, don't be afraid of floods when crossing the river," "Reason is spoken by everyone, accounts are calculated by everyone, and getting things done requires everyone's effort."

3. Promote the masses' simple policy ideas and educate them through action. Regarding the landlord's side: "The bigger the tree, the more land it takes up, and the big landlords exploit more poor people," "Walnuts and dates cannot be counted the same way, there is a difference between big and small landlords," "Tit for tat, softness for softness," "The more enlightened, the more concessions," "Struggle against those who are stubborn," "Concede when you are in the right," "Gold at home needs to be weighed, pretending to be stupid is useless."

Regarding the unity of the peasants: "People who are not relatives are relatives by occupation, people who pick up manure see people carrying baskets as relatives," "The Farmers' Association is our time, if the Farmers' Association is disbanded, there will be no time," "If the special agents sabotage our Farmers' Association, they are kicking away our rice bowls," "Point the guns outward, don't stab yourself in the leg," "If we organize, we can be masters of our own house," "If the cadres are not united, the masses are like doing business without capital," "The cadres are leading the work, but everyone has to do the hoeing," "After the cadres turn themselves around, they must not forget the poor people," "Turning oneself around is not just about getting things, poor people don't fight for profit."

II. The masses encourage each other and praise themselves:

In the joint urban-rural struggle in Wu'an, activists from the People's Association said to their members: "People are not afraid of changing the world and don't talk about sentiment. What are we afraid of?" Then the People's Association moved completely. After the struggle in Xiaowang, the activists encouraged each other and said: "The landlords are unreasonable, we are reasonable, truth overcomes unreasonableness." The tenant farmer activists in Nantian Village encouraged the masses and said: "My problem has been solved, why don't you speak up about your big grievances?" The workers' leader in Shaozhuang encouraged the workers and said: "We kiln workers wear felt hats and blue clothes, carry flat axes and lanterns, although we cannot go to heaven to see the Jade Emperor, we can also go underground to dig out five metals." After the rent reduction victory, the masses' enthusiasm for turning themselves around was overflowing everywhere, and they praised each other: "In previous years, the twelfth lunar month was like burning oil in the heart, this year we had a good autumn in the twelfth lunar month." Women from the same association said: "I have traveled east and west, and gone to the Cizhou market, but I have never participated in such a good struggle meeting." The peasants said: "As long as I can remember, I have never been as happy as this year for the New Year." When the masses elected Song Er from the same association as a county councilor, he said excitedly: "I have been farming in Xiaozhang Village for seventeen years, and I was a top hand, but I ended up begging with my wife and children. When the Eighth Route Army came, I became a councilor. I have really turned myself around."

III. Create a new public opinion of turning oneself around and leave a deep impression of turning oneself around.

When the masses take action in rent reduction, there will be new public opinion: "Chairman Mao is calling for turning oneself around," "The Communist Party and the people are of one heart," "When the Communist Party comes, good times come, with the Eighth Route Army, there are saviors," Intermediate figures also said: "The government is protecting the business, not the people," "The Eighth Route Army first appeases the people wherever they go, the Central Army first enjoys themselves wherever they go," "It is right for our Eighth Route Army to succeed, in the past people could never be united, now people are united." During the New Year's entertainment, the masses in each village enthusiastically held celebrations of turning themselves around. The masses carried out costume performances, exhibitions of struggle fruits, and rent reduction commemorative badges, all of which left a deep impression. In the "New Wu'an Rent Reduction Song," the masses sang: "Unite, our strength is great, rent reduction depends on ourselves, be bold, don't be afraid of anything." These all played a profound role in mobilizing the masses.

　　武安新区发动群众鼓动工作的经验
    在开展运动中，鼓动工作的主要任务，是点起火来，造成大规模的群众翻身运动。这点武安已获如下三点经验：
    一、集中群众的聪明，用群众自己的话，点醒群众。
    １、用群众生动的话打破群众良心命运情面思想。如云驾岭老雇工说：“我给掌柜家盖房子，弄瞎眼，不但不给工资，连饭也不给吃，就撵出我来了，我在他家受苦多年，这就是良心？”城北乡佃户们讨论命运说：“咱打下粮食不交给地主，看他穷了穷不了，如果也能穷，就不是好命。”他们又说：“过去穷人不如老财一把麦秸值钱，地主对咱是荞麦皮还榨四两油，有什么情面？”关于谁靠谁过活，伯延地主说：“你头顶足踏都是我的”，佃户们反驳说：“没有咱外来户，地主凉水也喝不上。”城乡联合斗争中，地主常兴韩承认说：“我多要了饭茶钱，又买成了地”，佃户说：“怪不得地主能发财，多要了咱的钱，买成地再剥削咱。”对变天思想，积极分子说：“咱翻了身买下枪，谁来破坏就打谁，咱打起来，八路军就来帮助了”。“咱的仇恨，就是政府的仇恨，政府一定给咱作主”，“咱穷人多，组织好民兵，反动派打来，还怕什么？”
    ２、把群众的话，变成群众行动的口号。“减租是减自己的”，“倒租倒仇气”，“算帐要清，理要说尽”，“要上一齐上，叫他想报仇也没办法”，“打破头不怕扇子扇，过河不怕大水淹”，“理是大家说，帐是大家算，要东西还得大家干。”
    ３、发扬群众中朴素的政策思想，在行动中教育群众，对地主方面：“树大拔地多，大地主剥削的穷人多”，“核桃枣不能一律数，大小地主有分别”，“硬对硬，软对软”，“越开明越让步”，“谁顽固再斗”，“得理让步”，“家有黄金外有称，装蒜捣鬼不中用”。
    对农民团结方面：“人不亲行亲，拾大粪的看见拿箩头的亲”，“农会是咱的时光，农会解散了就没时光”，“特务破坏咱农会，就是踢咱们的饭碗”，“枪口对外，刀子不往自己腿上插”，“组织起来就会当家”，“干部不团结，群众就是作买卖没本钱”，“干部是领工的，锄地还得大家干”，“干部翻了身，不能忘穷人”，“翻身不光要东西，穷人一家不争利”。
    二、群众互相打气，自己歌颂：
    武安城乡联合斗争中，平民会的积极分子向自己的会员说：“人家就不怕变天，不讲情面，咱还怕什么？”于是平民会全动起来。小汪斗争后，积极分子打气说：“地主是横理，咱们是真理，真理说倒了横理。”南田村佃户积极分子鼓励群众说：“我的问题解决了，你们这大冤枉还不说吗”？邵庄工人领袖鼓励工人说：咱们窑工是头戴毡帽身穿青，腰压扁斧手提灯，虽不能上天朝玉皇，也能下地刨五金。减租胜利后，群众翻身情绪，倒处洋溢，互相歌颂：“往年过腊月滚油烧心，今年腊月里过了一个好秋”。同会妇女说：“走过东到过西，赶过磁州集，没参加过这么好的斗争会。”农民们说：“从我记事起，就没今年过年高兴。”同会宋二的当翻身群众把他选成县参议员时，他兴奋的说：“我在小章村种地十七年，头等把式，结果领老婆孩子要饭出来，八路军来了，我当了参议员，真翻身了”。
    三、创造翻身新舆论，留下翻身深印象。
    群众在减租中行动起来，就有了新的舆论：“毛主席叫翻身”，共产党老百姓一条心”，“来了共产党，来了好时光，有了八路军，有了救命人”，中间人士也说：“政府是护理不护人”，“八路军到那先安民，中央军到那先享福”，“就该咱们八路军成事哩，过去人心总不能齐，如今人都齐心了”。年关娱乐中，各村群众都热烈的举行着翻身庆祝大会，群众们都进行化装表演，斗争果实展览会，减租纪念章等都留下了深刻的印象，在“新武安减租歌”中，群众这样唱着：团结起来力量大，减租减息靠自家，大胆起来吧，什么也不怕。这些都在群众中，起了深刻的鼓动作用。
