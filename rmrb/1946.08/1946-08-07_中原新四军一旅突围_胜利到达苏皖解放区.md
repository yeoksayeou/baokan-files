　　Central Plains New Fourth Army 1st Brigade Breaks Through
    Successfully Reaching the Suwan Liberated Area
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 4th] The Central Plains New Fourth Army, led by Li Xiannian, after breaking through the encirclement and attack of Chiang's troops on June 29th, had its entire 1st Brigade of the Eastward Advance 1st Column, under the leadership of General Pi Dingjun, victoriously reached the Suwan Liberated Area on July 20th. This unit traversed the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, undergoing a long march of over a thousand *li* for more than twenty days and nights, overcoming Chiang's troops' blockades, pursuits, encirclements, and ambushes, engaging in over ninety battles, large and small, and finally breaking through all obstacles, and joining forces with the New Fourth Army brothers in Central China. The Central China *Xinhua Daily* specially published this news of the victorious breakthrough in an important position, and published an editorial entitled "Respects to General Pi Dingjun's Troops," pointing out that "This exciting news proves that the people's army is an invincible force, and in the face of the iron will of seeking peace, unity, and survival, how despicable do the reactionaries' encirclements, blockades, attacks, and harassments appear! This news gives the military and civilians of the Suwan Liberated Area, who are facing a severe struggle, tremendous encouragement, because the victorious arrival of this fraternal unit not only strengthens our self-defense forces, but also brings rich combat experience."

　　中原新四军一旅突围
    胜利到达苏皖解放区
    【新华社淮阴四日电】中原新四军李先念部，自六月二十九日突破蒋军包围进攻后，其东进第一纵队第一旅全部在皮定钧将军率领下，已于七月二十日胜利到达苏皖解放区。该部横越豫鄂皖三省，经二十余昼夜千余里之长途行进，排除蒋军之封锁追剿夹攻与堵击，大小战斗九十余次，终于冲破一切阻难，与华中新四军兄弟会合。华中新华日报特于重要地位刊载此胜利突围消息，并以“谨向皮定钧将军所部致敬”为题发表社论，指出“这一令人兴奋的消息，证明了人民的军队是不可战胜的力量，在求和平求团结求生存的铁的意志前面，反动派的包围、阻击、袭击、困扰种种阴谋显得何等卑劣！这一消息给予面临严重斗争的苏皖解放区军民以莫大鼓舞，因为这支兄弟部队的胜利到达，不仅增强了我们的自卫力量，而且带来了丰富的战斗经验。”
