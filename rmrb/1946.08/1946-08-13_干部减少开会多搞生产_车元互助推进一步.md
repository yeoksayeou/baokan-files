　　Reduce Meetings, Increase Production;
    Promote Mutual Aid in Cart Transport Further

　  [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Among the village cadres in Licheng's Fifth District, a lack of enthusiasm for work and a desire to "rest and then work again" has become widespread this year. Cheyuan Village discovered this problem. After several ideological self-examinations, the cadres made deep reflections. They all pointed out that, on the one hand, there were too many meetings, and because they couldn't often participate in the mutual aid teams, they had to exchange at equal value, which meant paying more in labor costs. On the other hand, they often had to go to the county and district for meetings (or training and war participation). Each meeting meant lost work time and bringing food and money for provisions, so cadres were losing too much in the course of their work. After raising these issues, political director Guo Tianfu organized everyone to discuss them specifically and decided that cadres should lead mutual aid teams, solve problems as they arise, reduce large meetings, and adopt more liaison methods to exchange experiences to reduce lost work time. In addition, small-scale cooperatives and agricultural groups were organized in combination, with everyone pooling shares for production and profit-sharing, solving the difficulties of cadres' family production and the wage costs of attending meetings and losing work. This implementation has already achieved considerable results. In the bi-weekly production settlement, a total of 28,000 yuan was earned, with each share receiving a dividend of 700 yuan. For example, the militia committee director invested three shares (1,000 yuan per share) and gained a profit of 2,100 yuan. After using some of it to subsidize his food expenses and labor costs, most of it was reinvested in production as share capital. This immediately boosted the cadres' morale. In addition, the cadres personally participated in the mutual aid teams, which further promoted the work of the mutual aid teams. During the recent mobilization of the entire village for a major inspection, the number of model teams has increased from two to seventeen. (Shao Yuan, Liu Lin, Hui Cheng)

　　干部减少开会多搞生产            
    车元互助推进一步
　  【本报长治讯】黎城五区的村干部中，今年普遍发生工作不起劲，要求“歇工再干”的思想。车元村发现了这个问题，经过几次思想检查，干部做了深刻反省，都提出一方面会议太多，因不能经常参加互助组要等价交换就要出更多的工价。另一方面是常到县区开会（或受训参战），一开会要误工又要带粮食菜金，这样干部干工作当中亏损太大。提出这些问题后，政治主任郭天福组织大家具体讨论，决定干部领导互助组，发现问题随时解决，减少开大会，多采取接头办法交流经验，以减少误工。另外组织小型合作社和农业小组结合，大家集股生产分红，解决干部家庭生产及开会误工出工资的困难。这样实行已获相当成绩，在半个月的生产结算中，共赚二万八千元，每股分红七百元。如武委会主任入了三股（每股一千元）得利二千一百元，除一部贴补他的菜金工价外，大部又投入生产中作股金。这样干部情绪立即提高。此外干部亲自参加互助组，使互助组的工作亦推进了一步。在最近发动全村大检查时，已由两个模范组，增加到十七个。  （绍瑗、刘琳、会成）
