[Dispatch from Handan, 3rd] Recently, the Kuomintang rumor mill, the Central News Agency, spread news that Nationalist group member Major Dai Shu@ of the Yongnian group had been detained. This reporter has learned that this news is completely inconsistent with the facts, and is clearly a provocation fabricated by reactionaries. The purpose is to obstruct the progress of the group's work and create an excuse to restrict the freedom of our group members in the Nationalist area. The Yongnian group has issued a joint communiqué specifically denying this, stating: Former Nationalist group member Major Dai Shu@ left Yongnian for Handan at 4:20 PM on July 17th, and from Handan went to Anyang at 4:45 PM on July 17th. Because the CCP representatives were unaware that he was going to Anyang so hastily, they hoped to learn about the situation in Yongnian from him and help the group's work. Therefore, they notified the border guards to ask him to return. Major Dai returned to the group on July 18th, and the CCP side received him and gave him the same daily treatment as other group members. Major Dai went to Yongnian twice on July 21st and July 22nd to make contact, along with members of the three parties in the group. Major Dai left Handan for Anyang on July 28th.

　　中央社造谣国方组员被扣永年小组特发表公报否认
    【邯郸三日电】最近国民党造谣公司中央社宣传永年小组国方组员戴树＠少校被扣留消息，记者探悉此项消息完全与事实不符，显系反动派造谣滋事，目的在于阻挠小组工作之进行，并制造借口以限制现在国方地区我方小组人员之自由。永年小组顷为此事特发联合公报加以否认称：小组前国方组员戴树＠少校于七月十七日下午四时二十分钟由永年出城到邯郸，七月十七日下午四时四十五分钟由邯郸赴安阳，因中共代表不知其如此匆促赴安阳，希望由彼得悉永年情形，并帮助小组工作之进行，故通知边境哨兵处请其返回。戴少校于七月十八日返回小组，中共方面曾予招待，并给予其他组员同样之日常待遇。戴少校于七月二十一日及七月二十二日曾两次会同小组三方面人员去永年联络，戴少校于七月二十八日经邯赴安阳。
