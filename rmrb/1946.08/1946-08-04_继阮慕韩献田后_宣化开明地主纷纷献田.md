　　Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 1st. Following the donation of 3,000 mu of land by Ruan Muhan, President of the Chahar Provincial High Court, Li Feng, the Magistrate of Xuanhua County, also donated more than 130 mu of ancestral land. Leng Tiangui, the Secretary of the Communist District Committee in the First District, also donated 54 mu of land. When Huang Jianzhang, an enlightened gentry member of the Education Committee of Gexi Street in the Second District, donated land, he wrote to the government stating: "For the past eight years, the broad masses of farmers have supported the War of Resistance and provided assistance, and have suffered the most losses. I am willing to donate all 37 mu of my land, except for the 28 mu retained for living expenses." Later, Ma Peilan, the Director of the Women's Federation of Houfu Street, also persuaded her family to donate 81 mu of land, retaining 20 mu for their own use, and submitted a letter to the New Chahar Daily, "hoping that enlightened landlords and gentry in the province will jointly participate in this righteous act, so that Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of 'land to the tiller' can be realized first in the liberated areas." Under this influence, Zhang Zhijie and Zhang Zhixiao, landlords of Changzhuangzi, and Liu Chengzhang and Ma Yourong, landlords of Duandibao, also donated 463 mu of land. Wang Zhengming of Mashenmiao Street in the Third District of Xuanhua also donated 54 mu of land. Wang Zhengming said: "I cannot forget my roots. I suffered under the landlords when I was poor. Now I have become wealthy through business operations thanks to the Communist Party and the masses of the people. I should donate some land to help the poor people."
