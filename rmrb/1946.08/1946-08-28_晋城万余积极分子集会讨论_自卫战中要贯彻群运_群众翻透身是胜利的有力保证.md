　　【Our Newspaper, Yangcheng News】In August, the Jincheng sub-district held a rally of ten thousand activists to mobilize the continued implementation of the mass emancipation movement in the self-defense war, and to overcome the "almost there" mentality of cadres and activists. The mass movement in the county had been brought to a standstill in mid-July due to the participation in the war and the military enlistment campaign. Some cadres, seeing the enthusiastic and fervent participation in the war and military enlistment, became complacent and felt that the masses had been almost completely emancipated, and that there was no need for further in-depth implementation. Upon discovering this problem, the leadership convened rallies of ten thousand activists (approximately one thousand in each district) in nine districts from July 29th to August 4th, reflecting and raising many issues. During the discussion of "whether it is possible to defeat the reactionary's offensive if the masses are not emancipated or not thoroughly emancipated," everyone recalled the painful lessons of the December coup, when the masses were not emancipated, resulting in bloody devastation by Yan's puppet regime. Some pointed out that special agents were active, cooperating with the stubborn army's offensive, such as the Wangtai special agent in the Second District who controlled a group of militiamen, and some special agents secretly poured out the gunpowder from the militiamen's bullets and replaced it with earth. Some raised the issue of illegal landlords colluding with special agents in an attempt to "reverse the emancipation," and discovered the "three joys and three sorrows" of the local tyrants and illegal landlords - they were happy to hear that Chiang Kai-shek was fighting a civil war and prepared to organize internal responses; however, most villages had militiamen monitoring them, and they could not carry out activities, which was one joy and one sorrow. Later, many militiamen and activists went to support the front line, and they thought they had obtained a good opportunity for activity; however, as news of victory continued to arrive, their hopes of the stubborn army were shattered, which was two joys and two sorrows. Some cadres were deceived by the "almost there" mentality, and the movement came to a standstill, and the landlords were secretly happy; however, they heard that the district was holding a meeting of activists in early August, and the movement was about to resume, and they became afraid again, which was three joys and three sorrows. After discussing these many issues, the "almost there" mentality of cadres and activists was shattered, and it was realized that the anti-civil war must be combined with the mass movement, and only through the thorough emancipation of the masses can the reactionary offensive be defeated with powerful guarantees.

　　晋城万余积极分子集会讨论
    自卫战中要贯彻群运
    群众翻透身是胜利的有力保证
    【本报阳城讯】八月在晋城分区召开万人积极分子大会，动员在自卫战争中坚持贯彻群众翻身运动，打通干部与积极分子的“差不多”思想。该县群运于七月中旬因参战、参军运动而陷于停顿。有些干部看见轰轰烈烈的参战运动员兴奋而形成自满，认为群众翻身已翻得差不多了，用不着再深入贯彻了。领导上发现这个问题，即于七月二十九日到八月四日，先后在九个区分别召开了万人（每区一千左右）的积极分子大会，反映和提出了许多问题。当讨论“群众没翻身或没翻透身能不能打垮反动派的进攻”时，大家都回想到十二月政变时，由于群众没有翻身，致遭阎伪血腥蹂躏的惨痛教训。有的提出特务正在活动，配合顽军进攻，如二区王台特务掌握了一班民兵，有的特务暗将民兵子弹的火药倒出来换上土等。有的提违法地主与特务勾结，企图“倒翻身”，并发现恶霸与违法地主的“三喜三悲”——他们听说蒋介石打内战便高兴，准备组织内应；可是大多数村里都有民兵监视，活动不开，这是一喜一悲。后来许多民兵、积极分子都支援前线去了，他们以为得到了活动良机；可是胜利消息不断传来，他们盼望顽军的希望幻灭了，这是二喜二悲。有些干部被“差不多”思想迷惑，运动陷于停顿了，地主们暗中高兴；可是又听说八月初区上开积极分子会议，运动又要重新展开，又害怕起来，这是三喜三悲。这许多问题，经过讨论，打破了干部和积极分子的“差不多”思想，认识到反内战必需和群运结合，只有群众翻透身，才是打垮反动派进攻的有力保证。
