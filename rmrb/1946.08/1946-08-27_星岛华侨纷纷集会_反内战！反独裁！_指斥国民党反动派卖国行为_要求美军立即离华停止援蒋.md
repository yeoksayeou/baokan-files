Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 24th: Singapore dispatch: Mass rallies of overseas Chinese opposing civil war and dictatorship have spread to every corner of Singapore. More than ten mass rallies have been held in a month, with hundreds of thousands of participants. Not only Chinese but also Malays and Indians participated. Patriotic overseas Chinese also innovatively created an anti-civil war patriotic propaganda week. Trade unions under the General Federation of Trade Unions, district groups of the New Democratic Youth League, and organized shop assistants formed dozens of propaganda teams to explain the domestic political situation to all overseas Chinese (including women and children) in all overseas Chinese residential areas, calling on compatriots to take timely action to oppose the conspiracies of domestic reactionaries to undermine peace and democracy. At the "Ninth Prince" Temple, an old man, after the propaganda team finished speaking, climbed onto the stage and spoke a dozen "resolute oppositions" in one breath against civil war and dictatorship. His sincere emotions brought tears to the eyes of the audience. During propaganda at the Tongan machine shop, a young man was greatly moved and also went on stage to denounce the Kuomintang reactionaries' treacherous acts and the accomplices of American imperialism. Instantly, applause thundered, and the cry of "Oppose Civil War, Oppose Dictatorship" resounded through the streets. Overseas Chinese in various regions sent telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek's government by express mail, demanding that US troops immediately leave China, unconditionally stop the civil war, end the one-party dictatorship, establish a coalition government, punish corrupt officials, treat overseas Chinese dependents well, and provide relief to refugees. The Singapore New Democracy newspaper said: "The fiercer the civil war in China becomes, the higher the calls for peace at home and abroad become... This shows that the civil war in China has not received the support of the people." It continued: "The post-war movement of overseas Chinese to save their hometowns must focus on opposing civil war and dictatorship."
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 24th: Singapore dispatch: The Singapore Seamen's General Union, the New Democratic Youth League General Branch, the Women's Federation, the Singapore Office of the China Democratic League, the Malayan Ethnic and Trade Unions, and more than 50 other organizations held a grand anti-civil war rally on the anniversary of the "July 7th Incident," and passed a resolution on the spot to send telegrams to Chinese political party leaders, compatriots across the country, and US President Truman, calling for a halt to the civil war. The telegram to the leaders of various political parties and compatriots across the country stated: "Ten months have passed since the end of the War of Resistance, but peace has not been restored, and there are cries of suffering everywhere. Domestic reactionaries still want to rely on foreign aid to engage in fratricidal strife, and the country is in deep trouble and the people are living in misery. The Singapore Overseas Chinese Anti-Civil War Conference has resolved to make an urgent appeal on behalf of overseas compatriots, demanding that domestic parties abandon their grievances, permanently stop the civil war, implement peaceful nation-building, reopen the Political Consultative Conference, establish a democratic government, restore democratic freedoms, prohibit espionage activities, and order foreign troops to withdraw unconditionally to protect sovereignty and maintain the national lifeline." The telegram to Truman stated: "Japanese fascism has surrendered, but American troops are still stationed in China for a long time, and armed training of the Kuomintang army is the main reason for fueling the Chinese civil war. Overseas Chinese are indignant at this action by the United States and should respect China's independence and sovereignty, quickly withdraw troops stationed in China, stop the concession law, and cancel the ten-year military aid to China bill."

    【新华社延安二十四日电】新加坡讯：华侨反内战反独裁的群众大会遍及新加坡每个角落，一月之间举行的群众大会达十余次，参加人数达数十万。不仅有中国人，也有马来人与印度人参加。爱国华侨并创举了反内战爱国宣传周，总工会属下的各业工会，新民主青年团的各区分团及有组织的店员，成立了数十队宣传队，到一切华侨住区向所有华侨（包括妇女儿童）解释国内政局，号召侨胞及时行动起来，反对国内反动派破坏和平民主的阴谋。在“九王爷”庙，一个老头子在宣传队讲话完后爬上台去对内战和独裁一口气讲了十几个“坚决反对”，他的诚挚的感情使到会群众都落了泪。在台门机的宣传时，有一青年大受感动，亦上台指斥国民党反动派的卖国行为与美帝国主义的帮凶，一时掌声雷动，“反对内战反对独裁”的声浪响彻街衢。各地区华侨纷以快邮代电投寄蒋介石政府，要求美军立即离华，无条件停止内战，结束一党专政成立联合政府，惩办贪官污吏，善待侨眷，救济难民。新加坡新民主报称：“中国的内战打得越厉害，跟着海内外的和平呼声也就更高起来……这说明中国的内战并没有得到人民的拥护。”继称：“侨胞战后的救乡运动必须以反内战反独裁为中心任务”。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】新加坡讯：新埠海员联合总会、新民主青年团总团、妇女联合总会、中国民主同盟星岛办事处、马来亚各民族各业工会等五十余团体，曾于“七七”纪念日举行盛大的反内战大会，当场通过致电中国各政党领袖全国同胞及美总统杜鲁门，呼吁停止内战。在致各政党领袖及全国同胞电文中称：“抗战结束已历十月，和平未复，哀鸿遍野，国内反动派犹欲凭借外援作兄弟阋墙之争，国难深重，民不聊生；新加坡华侨各界反对内战大会决议，代表海外同胞作紧急呼吁，要求国内各党派捐弃嫌怨，永远停止内战，实行和平建国，重开政协会议，建立民主政府，恢复民主自由，禁止特务活动，并令外国军队一律撤退，以保主权而维国脉。”致杜鲁门的电称：“日本法西斯已投降，美国军队犹长驻中国，武装训练国民党军，实为助长中国内战之主因。海外华侨对美国此种行动莫不表示愤慨，应请尊重中国独立主权，迅速撤退驻华军队，停止租界法，取消十年军事援华法案”。
