　　Yan'an Well-Informed Sources Observe
    Marshall's Mediation Failed Due to the U.S.'s Erroneous Policy of Aiding Chiang
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th] U.S. Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly issued a statement on the 10th, stating that the KMT and the CPC were far apart on several fundamental issues, that the Chinese civil war was "expanding daily," and that it threatened to "sweep the entire country." According to observations from well-informed sources here, the points of contention between the KMT and the CPC that led to the failure of Marshall's mediation include at least the following: (1) The CPC has consistently insisted on an unconditional ceasefire, while the Kuomintang authorities have insisted on opposing this proposition, insisting on forcibly occupying areas such as northern Jiangsu, Rehe, Chahar, and the nine northeastern provinces. (2) The CPC insists on implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and immediately convening the PCC, while the Kuomintang authorities oppose this proposition, believing that political issues cannot be discussed without forcibly occupying the aforementioned areas. (3) The CPC advocates the establishment of a democratic coalition government accountable to the National Assembly, while the Kuomintang authorities oppose this proposition, insisting on one-party dictatorship. (4) The CPC advocates "politics leading the military" and "separation of military and civilian administration," while the Kuomintang authorities oppose this proposition, continuing military dictatorship. (5) The CPC demands that the Kuomintang authorities immediately implement the four promises, cease terrorist tactics against democrats, and guarantee the people's democratic rights and the legal status of all parties, but the Kuomintang authorities refuse this demand. Originally, the above points had already been agreed upon, and were already included in the ceasefire agreement, the PCC resolutions, and the military reorganization plan, but the Kuomintang authorities have continuously overturned these agreements, while the CPC has consistently struggled to realize these agreements. Well-informed sources continued: "Chinese democrats have long seen clearly that the reason why the reactionaries dare to act recklessly, causing the mediation of Marshall and Stuart to fail and creating the serious civil war situation that the two had to acknowledge, is actually the result of the U.S. authorities' erroneous policy of aiding the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government. Without even considering the distant past, after the U.S. State Department spokesman issued a statement on the 5th stating that "there is absolutely no change in the policy towards China," and after the Anping Incident on July 29th, the Kuomintang authorities' enthusiasm for carrying out the civil war further increased. Civil war expert Bai Chongxi cheered the U.S. State Department's statement, and Chen Cheng loudly advocated for a "military showdown." This fact should arouse the serious attention of the American people and democrats.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th] According to a dispatch from the United States Information Service, Nanjing, on the 10th: General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued a joint statement here this afternoon as follows:
    General Marshall and Dr. Stuart have continuously worked together to find various possible ways to end the increasingly expanding struggle in China and initiate the initial steps to establish a government in a truly democratic manner.
    As far as the Chinese people are concerned, the desire for a peaceful resolution of political problems seems to be consistent, and the economic situation must be resolved immediately in order to avoid complete collapse.
    The war is expanding daily and threatens to sweep the entire country beyond the control of those responsible. Both the KMT and the CPC are willing to end the war, but as far as an immediate solution is concerned, there are still some issues that have not been agreed upon.
    Regarding these issues, it seems impossible for both parties to reach a solution, and the resolution of these issues can indeed allow the issuance of universal orders to completely end the war in China. Some outstanding issues are related to military reorganization, but as far as resolving the problem is concerned, the difficulties caused in this regard are actually greater than another more fundamental problem. That is, what kind of local or county government should be maintained in each evacuated area after military reorganization before the National Assembly makes a fundamental decision on such matters? This is a fundamental issue.

　　延安消息灵通人士观察            
    马歇尔调停失败原因乃美国援蒋政策错误
　　【新华社延安十一日电】美特使马歇尔与大使司徒雷登二氏，于十日发表联合声明，表示国共双方在若干基本问题上，距离甚远，中国内战正在“日益扩大”，并有“席卷全国”之势。据此间消息灵通人士观察，造成马歇尔等调停失败的国共双方的分歧点，至少有下列数点（一）中共一向坚主无条件停战，而国民党当局则坚持反对这种主张，坚主武力占领苏北、热河、察哈尔、东北九省等地。（二）中共坚主实行政协决议，并立即召集政协会议，而国民党当局则反对这一主张，认为非武力占领上述地区无从谈政治问题。（三）中共主张成立对国会负责之民主联合政府，而国民党当局则反对这一主张，坚持一党专政。（四）中共主张“以政治军”、“军民分治”，而国民党当局则反对这一主张，继续军事独裁。（五）中共要求国民党当局立即实行四项诺言，停止对民主人士的恐怖手段，保证人民的民主权利与各党派之合法地位，而国民党当局则拒绝这一要求。本来以上数端早曾获得协议，早已包括在停战协定政协决议与整军方案之中，但国民党当局不断地推翻这些协议，而中共方面则始终为实现这些协议而奋斗。消息灵通人士继称：“中国民主人士早已看清楚反动派之所以敢于肆意妄为，使马歇尔与司徒雷登的调停归于失败，造成二氏所不得不承认的严重内战形势，实由于美国当局援助蒋介石独裁政府的错误政策的结果。远者姑且不论，在美国务院发言人于五日发表声明称“对华政策绝对无变更”，及七月二十九日安平事件发生以后，国民党当局进行内战的积极性更加提高，内战专家白崇禧对美国务院声明表示欢呼，陈诚则高唱“武力决赛”。这一事实，应当唤起美国人民与民主人士的严重注意。
    【新华社延安十一日电】据美国新闻处南京十日电：马歇尔将军与司徒雷登大使，今日下午在此发表联合声明如次：
    马歇尔将军及司徒雷登博士，曾不断共同就其各种可能方法，从事终止中国目前日趋扩大之斗争，并发起最初步骤，以依建立真正民主方式之政府。
    就中国人民而言，和平解决政治问题之愿望甚似一致，如欲避免完全崩溃，经济状况必须获有立即之解决。
    战争日益扩大，且有席卷全国超出负责者控制外之威胁，国共两方均愿终止战事，但以言有关立即解决则仍有若干问题未获协议。
    对于各该问题，双方似无获得解决可能，而此种问题之解决确可准许普遍命令之颁发，完全终止全中国之战事。若干悬而未决之问题乃系关于整军方面者，但就解决问题而言，此方面所引起之困难，实较另一更为基本之问题为将在国民大会对此种事件未获得基本决定前，整军后之各撤离区内应维持何种性质之当地或县政府，此即属其基本问题是也。
