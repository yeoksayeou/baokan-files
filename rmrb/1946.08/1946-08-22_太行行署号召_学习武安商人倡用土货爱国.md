　　Taihang Administrative Office Calls for
    Learning from Wu'an Merchants in Advocating the Use of Local Goods and Patriotism
    [This newspaper's Changzhi 18th dispatch] The Taihang Administrative Office recently called on the people of the entire region to launch a patriotic movement to advocate the use of local goods in order to protect the national industry and legitimate commerce of the Liberated Areas. The call stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to pursue dictatorship and civil war, collude with American imperialist elements and do not hesitate to sell out national interests, opening the door wide for American goods. The rampant influx of American goods has brought the national industry of the Kuomintang areas to the brink of extinction, and the industry of the Liberated Areas will become the fruit of national industry and national capital, and the hope of the country. The government and the military and civilians of the entire region should cherish this budding national industrialization, launch a movement to advocate the use of local goods, and promote the spirit of hard struggle of self-reliance, self-sufficiency, and self-sufficiency from the past eight years, so that the economy of the Liberated Areas will not be affected by this and will become increasingly prosperous. To this end, the following is called for: 1. Patriotic merchants throughout the region should serve the people of the Liberated Areas, exchange products of the Liberated Areas, and not act as compradors of foreign goods, but root their business in helping people's production and supplying people's needs, and learn from Wu'an merchants. 2. All industries and handicrafts should strive to improve, so as to achieve low cost, good quality, high output, and wide sales. The government will also reward inventions and creations. 3. The broad masses of the people should use local goods, which is a sign of awareness of saving the country and saving themselves. Every household should strive to become rich through diligence and thrift, develop their families through production, and use simple and durable local goods. 4. All government agencies, organizations, and schools should take the lead in practicing this and set an example.

　　太行行署号召
    学习武安商人倡用土货爱国
    【本报长治十八日讯】太行行署顷号召全区人民掀起爱国倡用土货运动，以保护解放区民族工业与正当商业。号召称：国民党反动派为了独裁、内战，勾结美帝国主义分子不惜出卖国家权益，为美货大开方便之门。泛滥的美货，已使国民党区之民族工业趋于绝境，解放区工业将成为民族工业、民族资本之硕果，与国家之希望。政府与全区军民均应爱护此国家工业化的幼芽，开展倡用土货运动，发扬八年来自造、自用、自给、自足的艰苦奋斗精神，使解放区经济不受此影响而日趋繁荣。为此号召：一、全区爱国商人要为解放区人民服务，交流解放区生产品，不作外货买办，把商业植根于扶助人民生产与供给人民需要上，向武安商人学习。二、一切工业、手工业应努力改进，做到成本低、质量好、产量高、销路广，政府并奖励发明、创造。三、广大人民应服用土货，这是救国自救的觉悟标志，户户应争取勤俭致富，生产发家，服用朴素耐用的土货。四、各机关团体学校均应首先实践，起模范作用。
