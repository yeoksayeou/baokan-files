[Report from this newspaper in Handan on the 24th] A spokesperson for the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region recently spoke to a reporter from this newspaper about the progress and results of the 11-day Longhai counter-offensive for self-defense. He stated: "Our military and civilians in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region have repeatedly protested against Chiang's troops' attacks on our eastern Henan Liberated Area, but to no avail. Since July, they have not only continued to penetrate every village and town in the eastern Henan Liberated Area, attempting to completely destroy our eastern Henan Liberated Area, but have also simultaneously launched a joint land and air offensive against the Liberated Area on both sides of the Longhai Railway. Our military and civilians in the Liberated Area, having reached the limit of their tolerance, were forced to rise up in self-defense. At midnight on the 10th of this month, they launched a counter-attack against the invading troops on the Longhai Line, successively liberating five county towns, including Lanfeng, Dangshan, Qixian, Tongxu, and Yucheng, as well as twelve stations, including Luowang, Neihuang, Lanfeng, Yejigang, Libaji, Liuheji, Xiaoba, Mamuji, Liudi Circle, Yangji, Dangshan, and Lizhuang, controlling 380 li of railway. The invading troops annihilated by us include the entire 181st Division (minus one battalion), one regiment of the 29th Division, one battalion of the 143rd Division, one battalion of the 81st Division, and two battalions of the 74th Division, totaling two divisions of regular troops. The security regiments attacking that were eliminated include the Lanfeng Security Regiment, the Dangshan Security Regiment, the Qixian Security Regiment, the 1st Security Regiment of the 12th Administrative Office of Henan, and the 3rd Security Regiment of Jiangsu. Also eliminated were the 2nd Battalion of the Special Service Regiment of the Aviation Commission, the Armed Officer Battalion of Chen Cheng's 18th Army, a part of the directly subordinate units of the 18th Division, the 1st Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Training Corps of the Armored Forces Corps of the Central Military and Political Department, and other puppet troops and special agent forces. Over 11,300 officers and soldiers, including regimental commanders Xu Wenqing and Song Tielin, laid down their arms, and 4,850 suffered pointless pain and sacrifice. We seized six American-made mountain guns, eighteen mortars, over 200 small cannons, eleven tanks, ninety American-made heavy machine guns, four hundred and fifty-eight light machine guns, seven thousand five hundred and eighty rifles, thirteen radio stations, twelve American-made automobiles, five hundred bicycles, one hundred telephones, and one hundred and thirty horses. Among those eliminated, the directly subordinate units of Chen Cheng's 18th Army's 18th Division were equipped with American weaponry and had just rushed from Wuhan, Hubei, to Xuzhou for combat." The spokesperson pointed out: "The main reason for achieving these results is the result of the concerted efforts of the military and civilians throughout the region. The people in the Liberated Area are extremely indignant at the Chiang army's invasion and its crimes of slaughtering compatriots with American weapons. For days, as many as 100,000 people have rushed to the self-defense front to participate in the war. A large number of comfort goods are piled up like mountains in the rear, and men, women, old and young, support the front together, which has given the heroic soldiers who defend their homes, defend peace, democracy, and national independence unlimited encouragement." The spokesperson continued to point out: "Although the invading troops have suffered serious blows, their attempt to attack has not stopped. They are continuing to mobilize troops and dispatch generals to launch a larger-scale offensive. The military and civilians in the entire border area have full confidence and united strength to meet and crush the Chiang army's offensive." The spokesperson finally warned the warmongering and reactionary authorities of the Kuomintang: "If they insist on their traitorous civil war policy and fail to realize their errors as soon as possible, it is tantamount to digging their own graves. The evil consequences in the future will inevitably lead to the destruction of those who play with fire."

    谈陇海自卫反击战经过战果
    蒋军进攻豫东解放区抗议无效我军民被迫自卫反击
    其官兵万余已放下武器四千余人遭到无谓痛苦牺牲
    【本报邯郸二十四日电】晋冀鲁豫军区发言人顷对本社记者发表陇海自卫反击战十一日来之战斗经过及其战果称：我晋冀鲁豫边区军民，对蒋军向我豫东解放区之进攻，曾经迭次提出抗议，都毫无效果。自七月以来，不仅继续深入豫东解放区的每一村镇，企图达到完全摧毁我豫东解放区之目的，并且同时以陆空联合的大军，向我陇海路两侧解放区进犯。我解放区军民忍无可忍，乃被迫起而自卫，于本月十日午夜，对陇海线上之进犯军，予以反击，先后解放了兰封、砀山、杞县、通许、虞城等五座县城及罗王、内黄、兰封、野鸡岗、李坝集、柳河集、小坝、马牧集、刘堤圈、杨集、砀山、李庄等十二个车站，控制铁路三百八十里，进犯军被我歼灭者计有一百八十一师全部（缺一个营）、二十九师一个团、一百四十三师一个营、八十一师一个营、七十四师两个营，共计正规军两师之众，消灭进攻之保安团队计有兰封保安团、砀山保安团、杞县保安团、河南第十二专署保安一团、江苏保安第三团等五个团。此处尚有航空委员会特务团第二营，陈诚第十八军之武装军官营，十八师之直属队一部，中央军政部装甲兵团教导总队第二团第一连，及其他伪军特务武装等亦被我歼灭。团长许文庆、宋铁林以下官兵一万一千三百余名放下武器，四千八百五十余名遭到无谓的痛苦和牺牲，缴获美式山炮六门、迫击炮十八门、小炮二百余门、坦克十一辆、美式重机枪九十挺、轻机枪四百五十八挺、步枪七千五百八十支、电台十三部、美造汽车十二辆、自行车五百辆、电话机一百部、马一百三十匹，其中被消灭之陈诚第十八军十八师直属队为美械装备，系新从湖北武汉兼程开赴徐州作战者。发言人指出：这些成绩获得的主要原因，实由于全区军民合作一致努力的结果。解放区人民对于蒋军之进犯及其在美国武器支援下屠杀同胞的罪行异常愤慨，连日奔赴自卫前线参战者计达十万之众，后方大批的慰劳品堆积如山，男女老小一起支援前线，更给了为保卫家乡保卫和平民主与民族独立的英勇战士以无限的鼓励。发言人继即指出：进犯军虽遭受了严重的打击，但其进攻企图尚未停止，正在继续调兵遣将作更大规模之进攻，全边区军民是有充分信心和团结的力量迎击和粉碎蒋军的进攻的。发言人最后警告国民党好战成性的反动当局称：如果他们要坚持其卖国内战政策不及早觉悟，无异自掘坟墓，未来的恶果必然使玩火者自遭毁灭。
