Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 4th: The Rehe People's Special Court publicly tried the three major traitorous war criminals on the 23rd of last month: Sun Baifang, the puppet governor of Rehe Province, Li Baohua, the puppet director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Xu Mingzhe, the chief of the Security Section of the puppet Police Department. They were sentenced to death in court and escorted to the "Tomb of Ten Thousand People," where anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians were massacred by the enemy and puppets in the past, to be executed by firing squad. During the fourteen years of Japanese and puppet Manchukuo rule, Sun and the other two traitors not only faithfully implemented the Japanese policy of destroying China, but also confessed to being accomplices who offered advice. Sun rose from a puppet county magistrate to the puppet governor of Sanjiang Province with the rank of Fifth Class Medal. He suppressed and bloodily washed the anti-Japanese allied forces of Generals Zhou Baozhong and Zhao Shangzhi, helping the enemy complete the construction of the "Northeast Defense Line," – the Japanese immigration plan of 206,000 people and the looting of 600,000 mu of land from the people; 151.2 million catties of grain and 100 million yuan were forcibly collected in two and a half years; 250,000 "Manchukuo soldiers" and 108,000 laborers were conscripted; and he advised the Japanese to use "appeasement" to strangle the underground movement of the Sanjiang base area of the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces. The "Tonghe Incident" in 1944 was Sun's most vicious "masterpiece." At that time, the 300 people who were arrested broke out of prison and armed themselves by breaking into the enemy's armory. The enemy "suppressed" the mountains several times to no avail. Sun went to the mountains to deceive the anti-Japanese righteous people to return home, causing the 300 armed people to fall back into prison. Last year, when the Eighth Route Army marched into Rehe West and Rehe South, and the enemy's "Southwest Defense First Line" rule was shaken, Sun was transferred to the post of puppet governor of Rehe Province to suppress the local people. Li Baohua had close ties with Lin Yixiu Xiong, the chief of the Japanese Qiqihar Special Service Agency, and Feng Yi, the chief of the General Affairs Department of Heilongjiang, before and after the "September 18th Incident." Since 1932, he had served as the chief of the Department of Civil Affairs of the puppet Longjiang Province, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs of the puppet Tonghua Province, the Counselor of the General Affairs Department of the puppet State Council, and the director of the Department of Industry of the puppet Jinzhou Province. In 1944, while serving as the puppet director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Rehe Province in the "Southwest Defense First Line," he personally planned the so-called "Down the Mountain Movement." At that time, the people of Rehe West and Rehe South opposed the enemy's policy of gathering families and villages into human circles and fled into the mountains. Li personally went to puppet Beijing to raise thousands of old clothes to lure some people back into the tribes, completing the enemy's conspiracy to gather families that could not be achieved by force, facilitating the enemy's rule and exploitation, and increasing the difficulty of the Eighth Route Army's anti-Japanese activities. In 1944, Li forcibly conscripted 130,000 laborers for the enemy in Rehe. In the past, the enemy could only forcibly levy 4 million taels of opium in Rehe. After Li offered the advice of "forcibly levying according to mu of land," it suddenly increased to 6 million taels. Xu Mingzhe served as a Japanese spy for 21 years. He had been active in Lushun, Dalian, Gongzhuling and other places since 1925. After the "September 18th Incident," he worked in the puppet Shenyang Police Department collecting anti-Japanese intelligence. Later, he entered the enemy's "Central Police School" and the Japanese Ministry of Interior Police Station for "advanced studies." In 1940, he went to Rehe to deal with the Eighth Route Army's Jireliao Advance Army. He personally went to Fengtian and Chiryu to serve as puppet county magistrate and direct the internal special service work. In mid-March 1941, he reported and arrested more than 200 good people. He was deeply trusted by the Japanese and was promoted to the chief of the Security Section of the puppet Rehe Police Department in June last year. After the liberation of Rehe, Sun, Li, and other traitors were arrested by our democratic government in November. After ten months of investigation and interrogation, the evidence was conclusive. Sun and the other three traitors also confessed that they deserved to die ten thousand times. The democratic government immediately executed the three criminals. The people throughout Rehe Province clapped their hands and cheered upon hearing the news.

Zhangjiakou, 2nd: Feng Yu Yan, a judge of the puppet Mengjiang Supreme Court, and Huang Shouli, the puppet president of the Zhangjiakou Municipal District Court, were tried by the Higher Court of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. On the 28th of last month, the Higher Court announced that, according to the revised regulations for punishing traitors, Feng and Huang were sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. Their traitorous property was confiscated according to law. Feng Yuyan was originally from Fangshan, Hebei. He was originally the president of the Nationalist Party's Zhangbei and Wanquan District Courts. After the Anti-Japanese War, he defected to the enemy and presided over puppet judicial and administrative affairs, successively serving as the president of the puppet courts in Zhangyuan and Zhangbei, the chief of the Higher Procuratorate of puppet Mengjiang, the director of the puppet Judicial Training Institute, and a judge of the puppet Supreme Court. He was deeply trusted by the Japanese and was once hailed as the "only qualified judge" in the puppet Mengjiang judicial circle. Huang Shouli was from Jian'ou, Fujian. Before the war, he was a judge of the Nationalist Party's Suiyuan District Court. After the Anti-Japanese War, he defected to the enemy and served as a judge of the Judicial Bureau of the puppet Suiyuan Maintenance Association, the president and judge of the puppet courts in Datong and other places, and the president of the puppet Zhangjiakou Municipal District Court. He was rewarded by the enemy with medals such as "Establishing" and "Judiciary."

    【新华社承德四日电】热河人民特别法庭于上月二十三日公审伪热河省长孙柏芳、伪民生厅长李葆华、伪警务厅保安科长徐明遮等三大汉奸战犯，当庭判处死刑，押赴昔日敌伪屠杀抗战军民的万人墓前执行枪决。孙等三逆在日寇与伪满统治十四年中，不但忠实执行日寇灭华政策，而且自供是献计帮凶者。孙逆从伪县长等职调升为五级勋爵的伪三江省长，曾镇压与血洗周保中、赵尚志等将军之抗日联军，帮助敌人完成了“东北国防线”的建筑，——日寇廿万六千人的移民与掠夺民间六十万亩土地计划；二年半中强征粮食十五万一千二百万斤，款一万万元；“满洲抽兵”二十五万名与劳工十万八千名；并献计日寇以“宣抚怀柔”绞杀抗日联军三江根据地的地下运动。一九四四年的“通河事件”便是孙逆最恶毒的“杰作”。当时被捕的三百人民越狱起义打破敌寇军械库武装了自己，敌寇数次进山“讨伐”无效，孙逆竟亲赴山林欺骗抗日义民回家，使三百武装人民重陷囹圄。去年八路军挺进热西热南，敌“西南国防第一线”统治动摇时，孙逆又调任伪热河省长，镇压当地人民。李逆葆华，在“九一八”前后与敌齐齐哈尔特务机关长林逸秀雄、黑龙江总务厅长峰一等交往甚密，从一九三二年起历任伪龙江省民生厅科长、伪通化省民生厅长、伪国务院总务厅参事官、伪锦州省实业厅长等职。一九四四年，在“西南国防第一线”任伪热河省民生厅长期间，即亲自策划所谓“下山运动”。当时，热西热南人民反对敌人集家并村的人圈政策逃入深山，李逆即亲赴伪京募集数千旧衣诱骗一部分人民回入部落，完成日寇武力所不能达到的集家阴谋，便利日寇统治榨取，增加八路军抗日活动的困难。一九四四年，李逆在热河为敌寇强征了十三万劳工。敌寇往年在热河只能强征四百万两大烟，经李逆献计“以配给按亩强征”后，竟突增至六百万两。徐明遮当了二十一年日本特务，他从民国十四年起即在旅顺、大连、公主岭等地活动。“九一八”后，在伪沈阳警察厅任搜集抗日情报工作，后入敌寇“中央警察学校”及日本内务警察所“深造”，一九四○年到热河，对付八路军冀热辽挺进军，曾亲到丰田、雏龙当伪县长指挥内线特务工作；一九四一年三月中旬，即检举逮捕二百余善良人民；深得日寇信任，于去年六月升伪热河警察厅保安科长。热河解放后，孙李等逆于十一月为我民主政府逮捕，经十个月的调查审讯，证据确凿，孙等三逆亦自认罪该万死，民主政府即将该三犯明正典刑。热省全境人民闻讯莫不拍手称快。
