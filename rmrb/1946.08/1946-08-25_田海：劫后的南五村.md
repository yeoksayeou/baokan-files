　　South Wu Village is located in Zhangnan District of Linzhang, three miles away from the Liuyuan stronghold occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet Guo Qing. On July 18th, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet Wang Ziquan and Guo Qing gathered four companies of troops, violated the ceasefire order, and suddenly occupied this liberated village, and then cruelty and darkness shrouded this small village of less than a hundred households.

　　On the morning of the 20th, our army liberated the village again. As soon as we entered the village, the marks left by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops on the people were immediately revealed.

　　Early in the morning, the Eighth Route Army arrived in the village. The old people hiding in the messy haystacks and destroyed rooms slowly poked their heads out, showing smiles.

　　An old lady in her fifties tightly grabbed a soldier's hand, with tears in her eyes, and said: "Comrade Eighth Route Army, you really came again! Please sit down, I'll tell you, I haven't been afraid in the six months you were here, but these three days have made me sick. There's nothing left in the house!" She was crying and couldn't speak anymore. The soldier comforted her, and she let go of his hand. In the house of a landlord in the west of the village, three or four young women, with their hair disheveled, were looking around for things. An old man dug out a pile of tattered old cotton wadding from the woodpile, and then said to them: "Don't look for it anymore, all the quilts in our house are here!" Because the cover and lining had been torn off by the puppet troops. The old man said with a sad face: "Comrade! You were stationed here for six months and our family didn't lose a needle or thread. These three days not only took everything away, but also... hey! I'm not ashamed to say it! My daughters-in-law were also violated!"

　　The tenant Wang Lao Bo伯's ox was not brought out in time when Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops entered the village. The puppet troops shot it to death with a gun, and also forced the civilians to slaughter it and distribute it to each family to make dumplings for themselves. Wang Lao Bo伯's family took the meat from their own ox, looked at it and said: "My ox was killed by the big bosses!" The puppet troops shamelessly replied: "It was killed by the Eighth Route Army!" Wang Lao Bo伯 stubbornly said: "I saw clearly that you killed it, how can you insist that it was the Eighth Route Army?" They beat Wang Lao Bo伯 severely without saying a word.

　　田海：劫后的南五村
    南五村位于临漳的漳南区，距蒋伪郭清盘据之柳园据点三里路。七月十八日蒋伪王自全郭清集结了四个连的兵力，破坏停战命令，又突然把这个解放的村庄占领了，于是残苦和黑暗，笼罩了这个不满百户的小村庄。
    二十日晨，我军再次解放该村，当我们刚一进村，蒋伪铁蹄留在人民身上的烙印，便立刻现在面前。

    清晨，八路军赶到了村里，躲闪在乱杂的草堆和破坏了的房间里的老百姓慢慢探出头来，现出笑色。
    一个五十多岁的老太太紧紧的拉住了一个战士的手，含着热泪说：“八路军同志，你们真又来啦！快坐下，我诉告你，你们在这里六个月，我没有害过怕，这三天可治坏了我。家里什么都没有了！”她已哭泣的不能说了，战士安慰了她一番，她才放开了手。村西头的一个地主家里，三四个青年妇女，披散着头发东张西望的在找东西，一个老头从柴堆里掀出了一堆破乱了的旧棉絮之后，对着她们说：“别再找了，咱家的盖的全在这里！”因为盖的面和里已被伪军撕去了。老头哭丧着脸说：“同志！你们在这里驻了六个月我家没少一针一线，这三天东西给弄完还不算，咳！也不说丢人啦！媳妇子也都被糟塌啦！”

    佃户王老伯伯的一头牛，在蒋伪进村时没有来得及牵出来，蒋伪用枪给打死后，还逼着民夫杀了，分给每家去给他们自己包饺子，王老伯伯家里拿着自己牛身上的肉，一边看一边说：“我的牛可是叫老总们打死了的！”蒋伪无耻的回答：“是八路军打死的！”老伯伯执拗的说：“我看见明明是你们打死的，怎么硬说是八路军呢？”他们一声不响把王老伯伯暴打一顿。
