　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: *Pravda* international observer Viktorov wrote on the 25th: The simultaneous application of unwarranted pressure by the United States on Yugoslavia and by the United Kingdom and the United States on Poland cannot be regarded as a mere coincidence. Everyone remembers that American planes flew over Yugoslavia as many as 172 times. The US government used the pretext of a Yugoslav aircraft forcing an American plane to land and issued an unusually stern note to Yugoslavia, demanding in a *diktat*-like manner the release of the detained passengers within 48 hours. American newspapers, as if at the wave of a company commander's baton, launched a heated anti-Yugoslav campaign, demanding the most resolute action against an allied country that was defending its legitimate rights. American newspapers even discovered in this "incident" an excuse to break up the peace conference. A United Press Paris correspondent stated that Byrnes was prepared to agree to the failure of the peace conference; if the goal of the struggle against Yugoslavia was not achieved, it would cause the peace conference to break up. The American ultimatum came too late; Yugoslavia had released the pilot before receiving it. Thanks to the statesmanship of the small country of Yugoslavia, the "incident" did not deteriorate. However, the fact remains that a major power used unprecedentedly crude pressure against a small country. The general impression is that this action was intended to place Yugoslavia in an unequal position when the peace conference discussed issues related to Yugoslavia, and the United Press correspondent also acknowledged this point. As for Anglo-Polish relations, the United Kingdom's behavior in issuing a note to Poland regarding future elections can only be seen as open interference in Poland's internal affairs. The British note not only ordered Poland to hold elections in accordance with the conditions set forth in the note but also demanded that the Polish electoral law be sent to the British ambassador so that the British government "can decide whether it includes the provisions that the United Kingdom hopes to observe." The United States also issued a similar note to Poland, although not in a *diktat*-like manner. It is not difficult to see that the United Kingdom's diplomatic pressure on Poland has a clear purpose, namely, to infringe upon the independent sovereignty of a free and independent Polish state. The Anglo-American diplomatic pressure on Yugoslavia and Poland demonstrates the true attitude of the Anglo-American bloc toward small countries, an attitude that provides a strong basis for assessing the actions of the Anglo-American bloc at the peace conference.

　　真理报评英美粗暴外交
    侵犯南波独立主权
    意图破坏和会工作进行
    【新华社延安廿六日电】莫斯科讯：真理报国际观察家维克特罗夫二十五日撰文称：美国对南斯拉夫、英美对波兰同时施行绝无正当理由的压力，人们不能把这看成是偶然的巧合。每个人都记得，美机飞行于南国上空共达一七二次，美国政府利用南国飞机迫使美机一架降落的口实，向南提出了措词空前严峻的照会，用哀的美敦书的方式，要求在四十八小时内释放机上被扣乘客。美国报纸好象在一个连队指挥者杆子一挥之下发动了火热的反南运动，要求对于维护其正当权利的盟国采取最坚决的行动。美国报纸甚至在此“事件”中发现了和会破裂的借口。合众社巴黎访员称：贝纳斯准备同意和会的失败；如果对南斗争的目的未达到，它会使和会破裂。美国的通牒来得太迟了，南国在接获它之前就释放了驾机师，由于南斯拉夫小国的政治家风度，“事件”并未恶化下去，然而一个大国对小国使用了空前未有的粗暴压力，则是事实。一般人的印象是此种行动意图在和会讨论与南有关问题时，将南国置于不平等的地位，而合众社访员也承认了这一点。至于英波关系，英国关于未来选举，向波兰提出照会的行为，只有被认为是对波兰内政的公开干涉。英国照会不仅命令波兰遵照照会所提的条件举行选举，而且要求应将波兰选举法送交英大使，以便英国政府“可以决定其中是否包括有英国希望前往观察的条款在内”。美国向波兰也提出了同样的照会，虽然不是用哀的美敦书方式。不难看出：英对波兰的外交压力是会着明确的目的，即侵犯自由独立的波兰国家的独立主权。美英对南波的外交压力，表明了英美集团对小国的真正态度，这种态度提供了强有力的根据来估计英美集团各国在和会上的行动。
