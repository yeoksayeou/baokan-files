　　The U.S. Government is Undermining China's Peace
    The People Should Rise Up to Stop It
    Guo Moruo and Others Initiate a Signed Letter to the American People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] Shanghai Dispatch: Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Xu Guangping, Tian Han, and others initiated a signed "Letter to the American People" in Shanghai in mid-July. People from all walks of life in Shanghai enthusiastically participated in the signing. The letter stated, "Whether the civil war in China will continue depends almost entirely on you Americans." It also pointed out that the current U.S. government's assistance to the Kuomintang authorities in carrying out the civil war is detrimental to both the Chinese and American people. Because the reactionary forces in China not only oppose Chinese democracy but also oppose the United States and other democratic forces; they not only attempt to undermine China's peace but also attempt to undermine the peace between the United States and the Soviet Union. The letter calls on the American people to rise up and "stop the U.S. government from destroying the Chinese people's opportunity to strive for democratic peace, in order to maintain friendly and mutually beneficial diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries."

　　美政府破坏中国和平
    人民应当起来阻止
    郭沫若等发起签名致美国人民书
    【新华社延安五日电】沪讯：郭沫若、沈钧儒、马叙伦、许广平、田汉等，于七月中旬在沪发起签名“致美国人民书”，沪市各界参加签名者甚为踊跃。该书称：“中国的内战是否会继续下去，几乎完全决定于你们美国人”。并指出目前美国政府帮助国民党当局进行内战，对中美人民都是不利的。因为中国反动势力，不但反对中国民主，而且反对美国和其他的民主势力；不但企图破坏中国的和平，而且企图破坏美苏间的和平，该书要求美国人民起来“阻止美国政府破坏中国人民争取民主和平的机会，以维持两国人民友善互利的外交，经济和文化关系”。
