　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Comprehensive reports: After the Indian Muslim League rejected the British plan for India, Indian Viceroy Wavell authorized the Congress Party on the 10th to organize the Indian Interim Government and asked the Congress Party to continue negotiations with the Muslim League. On the 13th, Congress Party President Nehru wrote to Muslim League President Jinnah, requesting the Muslim League to cooperate in forming an interim government. On the 15th, Nehru personally visited Jinnah to discuss the issue of inviting the Muslim League to join the interim government. It is reported that the discussion yielded no results. The Congress Party has drafted two cabinet lists, one including representatives of the Muslim League, and the other without. So far, there is no indication that the Muslim League will participate in the interim government. The Congress Party revealed that it will establish the interim government within the week, regardless of whether the Muslim League participates or not. It is reported that in the proposed interim government, Nehru will serve as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The British plan for the Indian interim government has changed several times. The first plan was rejected by the Congress Party on June 14 because it stipulated that the Congress Party and the Muslim League should be in an equal position in the interim government. The second plan stipulated that the ratio between the Congress Party and the Muslim League in the government should be six to five, which was also rejected by the Congress Party. The Muslim League believed that Britain had violated its promise to give the Congress Party and the Muslim League equal status in the interim government, and rejected the British plan for India on July 28.

    尼赫鲁致函金纳要求回盟合作
    【新华社延安十六日电】综合报导：印回教同盟拒绝英国对印计划后，印督魏菲尔已于十日授权国大党组织印度临时政府，并要国大党继续与回盟谈判。十三日国大党主席尼赫鲁致函回盟主席金纳，要求回盟合作共组临时政府。十五日尼赫鲁并亲访金纳，讨论邀请回盟加入临时政府问题。据悉，讨论无何结果。国大党已拟就两个内阁名单，其一包括有回盟代表，另一则没有。迄今为止，仍未有回盟将参加临时政府的迹象。国大党方面透露，国大党将于周内成立临时政府，不管回盟参加与否。据悉拟议中的临时政府，尼赫鲁将任总理兼外长。按英国对印临时政府的计划曾数度改变，首次计划因规定国大党与回盟在临时政府中处于平等地位而于六月十四日被国大党拒绝，第二次计划规定国大与回盟在政府中为六与五之比，亦为国大党拒绝，回盟则认为英国违背了在临时政府中予国回处于平等地位的诺言，而于七月二十八日拒绝了英国对印计划。
