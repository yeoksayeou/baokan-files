Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 18th: According to the Tianjin Yishibao on August 14th, Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "new fleet" is nothing more than eight old ships given by the United States. Among these eight old ships, there are two destroyers (Taikang, Taiping), four minesweepers, named Minsheng, Yongyu, Yongding, and Yongning, and two warships (Yongtai, Yongxing). The ship names were given only after arriving in China. In the United States, they were only numbered because the tonnage was too light to qualify for naming. The largest, the Taikang ship, is only 1,300 tons, with only 10 officers and 218 soldiers on board. This large ship, which is often visited by Chinese and American officials and people from all walks of life, is only this size; the other seven ships are even smaller, with one being only over 500 tons. A week after the new fleet arrived in Beijing, the price of American cigarettes in Nanjing plummeted, and watches, pens, soap, etc., suddenly flooded the market. Upon investigation, it was found that in addition to transporting four of the latest cars, the new fleet was also loaded with the above-mentioned American goods. Xu Heng, the dismissed captain of the Yongning ship, was the biggest embezzler among this group of naval officers. When he went abroad, he bought US dollars everywhere. After arriving in the United States, he often went to the naval cooperative to purchase excessive items, which led to protests from the naval cooperative, which at one point refused to sell anything to the Chinese navy. Xu Heng is just a typical example; other officers brought back a lot of medicines and fabrics in much the same way.

　　蒋介石的所谓“新舰队”
    【新华社延安十八日电】据八月十四日天津益世报报导：蒋介石的所谓“新舰队”，不过是美国所给的八艘旧舰而已，这八艘旧舰中，有驱逐舰两艘（太康、太平），扫雷艇四艘，以民胜、永余、永定、永宁为名，战舰两艘（永泰、永兴）。舰名是到了中国才起的，在美国时只编号数，因为吨位轻，根本就够不上命名的资格。其中最大的太康舰，不过一千三百吨，上面仅有官员十人，士兵二百十八人。这艘常供中美长官和各界人士参观的大舰不过如此，其他七舰更小，有一艘只有五百多吨。新舰队抵京一周后，南京的美国香烟大跌价，手表、钢笔、肥皂等突告充斥，追究原因，新舰队上除了载运四辆最新式的汽车外，还载满了上述各种美国货。被撤职的永宁舰长徐亨是这一批海军军官中的舞弊大王，在出国时他就到处收买美金，到美国后，他常常到海军合作社购买超额物品，以致曾引起海军合作社的抗议，一度不卖东西给中国海军。徐亨不过是个典型，其他军官都大同小异的带了很多药品衣料回来。
