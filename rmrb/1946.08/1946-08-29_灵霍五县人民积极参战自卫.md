　　[From the Tongpu Front, 25th Dispatch] During this Huo County liberation battle, over 6,500 civilians and militiamen from Ling (Shi), Huo (County), and other five counties along the Tongpu Railway enthusiastically participated in the war. The masses of Zhao Cheng, who had just been liberated, spontaneously organized a 500-person stretcher transport brigade to support the people of Huo County in their battle. From Anze County, two days away from Huo County, the masses spontaneously organized a massive 1,300-person stretcher team and rushed to the front lines. The militiamen and self-defense team members of Qin Yuan County once again demonstrated their spirit of tenaciously struggling to wear down the Japanese invaders in the past, throwing themselves into the forefront of the self-defense war, and ultimately entering Huo County alongside their brothers in arms.
　　[Heze, 24th Dispatch] The Jilu Yu Daily published an editorial on the 20th titled "The Entire Region's Military and Civilians Urgently Mobilize to Defend the Border Region," which stated in brief: Chiang Kai-shek is mobilizing large forces to repeatedly "cleanse" our eastern Henan liberated areas and is deploying a major offensive along the Longhai Railway. East of the Pinghan Railway, the sound of Chiang's army shelling our Hua County, Daokou, Dongming, and Junxian counties has already begun. The entire region's military and civilians must immediately respond to the call of the Central Bureau to resolutely defend ourselves and thoroughly repel the reactionary faction's offensive. We have the experience of the eight-year victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, an invincible armed force of regular army, local army, and militia integrated as one, and the unanimous patriotic and self-defensive high courage of the whole people and previous self-defense wars. We will surely win. But victory cannot be waited for. Chiang Kai-shek's army is pressing in, and a major battle is about to unfold. We call on all the military and civilians in the border region to urgently mobilize, enthusiastically participate in the war, do a good job in war support work, carry stretchers, deliver ammunition, support the front lines, and guarantee victory. All the militia in the region should immediately mobilize to cooperate with the main force to carry out guerrilla warfare around the enemy. Men, women, and children who remain at home should organize mutual aid to seize the time to urgently prepare for the autumn harvest and cultivate and harvest on behalf of the families of those participating in the war. Finally, the editorial called on Communist Party members to play a firm, exemplary, and leading role in all kinds of work, to carry forward Chairman Mao's spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, to unite closely, and to guide the sacred patriotic self-defense war towards complete victory.
