Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. Seven American soldiers who intruded into the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area and were disarmed were released amicably on the 24th of last month by the 13th Military Sub-district of the Eighth Route Army in Eastern Hebei. General Rockey, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, and Deputy Commander General Dunaki visited General Ye Jianying, the Chinese Communist Party member of the Executive Headquarters, on the 26th of last month to express their gratitude. Accompanied them were Mr. Robeson, the American representative of the Executive Headquarters, and Brigadier General Tian Bomen, Director of the Executive Office.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. In its 84th telegram issued on the 30th, the Central News Agency published a statement by a "certain high-ranking military officer" in Beiping regarding the conflict near Anping Town. Concerning the Chinese Communist Party's demand for the withdrawal of American troops from Chinese territory, it was described as an "insult to the United States" and "having ulterior motives." The self-defense actions of the people in the Liberated Areas were referred to as "unjust and unreasonable," and "barbaric actions." This "high-ranking military officer" also made every effort to provoke discord between the United States and the people of the Liberated Areas, saying, "Expressing boundless sympathy for the American soldiers who were killed or injured (i.e., those who were pointlessly sacrificed after being thrown into China's civil war by the reactionaries), and expressing extreme indignation at the barbaric methods of the Communist side (i.e., self-defense measures)." This spokesperson for the Chiang government claimed to be speaking from "the standpoint of the Chinese people," but any Chinese person reading his statement would feel that it did not sound like the words of a Chinese person at all. Therefore, after broadcasting this statement, the Central News Agency editorial department hurriedly issued a notice of "immediate withdrawal."

　　我友谊释放七名美兵
    骆基将军亲致谢意           
    蒋方挑拨美国与解放区关系
    【新华社延安一日电】侵扰冀东解放区被解除武装之七名美兵，上月二十四日由八路军冀东十三军分区友谊释放。驻华美军陆战队司令骆基将军及副司令杜纳基将军，于上月二十六日往访执行部中共委员叶剑英将军致谢。陪同往谢者，有执行部美方代表饶伯森及执行处主任田博门少将。
    【新华社延安一日电】中央社于三十日播发第八十四号电内，发表北平“某高级军事长官”关于安平镇附近冲突事件的谈话，对中国共产党要求美军自中国领土上撤退一事，竟指为“侮辱美国”，“别具用心”。对解放区人民的自卫行动，则指为“背义违理”，“野蛮行动”。该“高级军官”并尽力挑拨美国与解放区人民的关系，他说：“对美军之死伤者（按即被反动派投入中国内战而无谓牺牲的人）表示无限同情，对共方之野蛮手段（按即自卫手段）则不胜愤恨”。这位蒋政府的发言人，自称为“中国人的立场”，但任何中国人读了他的谈话，都会感觉到太不像中国人的话。于是中央社编辑部在广播这篇谈话以后，又匆忙地发布“应即撤消”的通知。
