Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Kyiv News: Ukraine is intensifying construction. In agriculture: According to materials from the country's Ministry of Agriculture, as of August 10, 1.4 million hectares (one hectare equals 16 mu) of land had been harvested, of which 57 percent had been threshed. In animal husbandry: The Ukrainian government has approved the 1946 plan for the restoration and development of animal husbandry. After Germany occupied Ukraine, only 6.3 percent of the cattle, 1.9 percent of the pigs, and 3.4 percent of the sheep existing in 1940 remained in the country. After the collective farmers' efforts to restore it, the number of cattle this spring has reached 66 percent of the pre-war level, pigs 23 percent, and sheep 29 percent. By 1950, the total number of cattle in the country will not only reach the pre-war level but will also exceed it. In terms of housing construction: 3.4 million houses will be built in the countryside in the next five years. The Soviet authorities are now helping Ukrainian farmers to move from caves and basements into good houses as quickly as possible. Farmers have been living in caves and basements since the German bandits destroyed their homes. Now 400,000 houses have been repaired or rebuilt. Plans have been drawn up for the gasification of major industrial cities in Ukraine (Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Kryvyi Rih, Nikopol, etc.) and factories, mines, and mines. Gas will be supplied by new coking plants and chemical plants and specially set up coking and gas plants.
