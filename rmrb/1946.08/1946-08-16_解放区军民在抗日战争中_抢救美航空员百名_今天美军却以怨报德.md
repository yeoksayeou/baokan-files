Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th—This reporter has reliably learned that from February 1944 to the end of 1945, the army and people of the liberated areas successively rescued 118 Allied airmen, of whom, excluding one British and nineteen Indian, the rest were all Americans. Among those rescued were two field officers and seventy-one junior officers. The rescue locations included all liberated areas from Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning to South China. The most rescues were in the South China Liberated Area, with 28 people, followed by the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning area with 23 people, Central China with 22 people, and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan with 21 people. All of the above personnel were forced to land during combat or transport flights against Japan. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the army and people of the liberated areas, actively cooperating with the Allied forces, spared no effort to rescue these stranded personnel, even at great risk, especially near enemy-occupied areas, and even made the greatest sacrifices to rescue an Allied pilot. After being rescued, these Allied airmen received all kinds of preferential treatment and assistance from the army and people of the liberated areas, and every effort was made to send them back to their original units or their national organizations in China, overcoming various difficult conditions. When passing through Japanese-occupied areas, troops were dispatched to escort them to protect their safety. For example, on February 2, 1945, the army and people of the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area rescued Captain Axel Hamble, pilot of the 854th aircraft of the 20th Bomber Squadron, and ten others at Emei Mountain northeast of Pinggu (very close to Anping Town, where conflicts have occurred today due to U.S. military provocations). Afterwards, they were escorted in two groups to Yan'an on April 17th and May 13th, respectively, and then transferred to the rear to rejoin their units. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: When the U.S. military in China today is actively assisting the Kuomintang reactionaries, and even directly participating in expanding the Chinese civil war and bombing the army and people of the liberated areas, it is very useful for us to recall the above facts.

　　解放区军民在抗日战争中
    抢救美航空员百名
    今天美军却以怨报德
    【新华社延安十三日电】记者从可靠方面获悉：自四四年二月至四五年底，解放区各地军民曾先后救护盟国空军失事人员一一八人，其中除一名英籍和十九名印度籍外，余皆为美人。在上述被救人员中，包括两名校官及七一名尉官。获救地点包括自冀热辽至华南各解放区，其中最多者为华南解放区，救出二八名，次为冀热辽区救出二三名，华中二二名，晋冀鲁豫二一名。上述人员皆为对日作战或运输飞行中被迫降落。在抗日战争中，积极配合盟军作战之解放区军民，对这些失事人员皆不顾危险奋力抢救，特别是在接近敌人占领区甚至为救出一名盟国飞行员而付出最大牺牲。这些盟国空军人员于被救后，曾受到解放区军民之各种优待和帮助，并克服各种困难条件，设法将其全部送还原部或其本国在华机关。在通过日寇占领区时，为保护彼等之安全，皆派遣军队护送。如四五年二月二日，冀东解放区军民于平谷东北之峨眉山（距今日由于美军挑衅而发生冲突的安平镇甚近）救护廿轰炸机队八五四号机阿撤尔汉贝上尉等十一名，事后分两批于四月十七及五月十三日先后护送抵延安，转赴大后方归队。新华社记者评称：当今天在华美军积极援助国民党反动派，甚至直接参加扩大中国内战，轰炸解放区军民的时候，让我们回忆一下上述事实，是很有用处的。
