    Chiang's Troops Eat Rice While the People Eat Coarse Grains
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th -- Shenyang News: The Kuomintang Liaoning Provincial Government recently announced a method of rationing rice that is no different from the Japanese imperialists' rule over the Northeast. That is (1) With the exception of Chiang's troops, local residents and expatriates in the province should mainly eat coarse grains such as flour, sorghum, and corn. (2) Restaurants and hotels should not prepare rice porridge or rice. (3) All grain merchants are prohibited from buying and selling rice.
