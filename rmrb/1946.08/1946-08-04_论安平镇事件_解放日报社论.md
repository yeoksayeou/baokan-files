　　On the Anping Town Incident
　　*Liberation Daily* Editorial
　　A patrol team of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin, China, along with units of the Kuomintang army, suddenly patrolled near Anping Town, about 70 kilometers northeast of Tianjin, on the morning of the 29th. They intruded into the defense area of the Eighth Route Army in eastern Hebei and attacked the local garrison. The garrison was forced to defend itself, resulting in casualties on both sides. Not only did the U.S. military fail to admit their mistake, but they also reinforced their troops and deployed U.S. Air Force to cooperate. A certain "high-ranking military officer" of the Kuomintang in Beiping regarded the foreign troops' slaughter of Chinese people on Chinese territory as supreme glory and expressed utmost gratitude. However, he described the Chinese people's legitimate self-defense against the foreign troops' invasion as "a barbaric act, whether planned by the CCP itself or instigated by others." The Kuomintang reactionaries are clearly trying to drag the U.S. military into the vortex of the Chinese civil war, and the aggressors within the U.S. military are also deliberately throwing themselves into this vortex, desperately challenging the Chinese people.

　　The landing of U.S. troops in China after Japan's surrender was, in itself, a mistake, violating the will of the peace-loving American people and the American soldiers who wanted to return home. The continued stationing of U.S. troops in North China after the so-called task of repatriating prisoners of war in North China had ended, delaying their withdrawal, was an even greater mistake. The CCP and the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas openly opposed these mistakes by the U.S. authorities. However, in order to preserve the friendship between the Chinese and American people, the CCP and the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas have never taken hostile actions against the U.S. military. Yet the U.S. military has not only openly sided with the Kuomintang, guarding ports and railways for the Kuomintang army, but has also frequently provoked the Liberated Areas. Not to mention anything else, in eastern Hebei alone, according to the Eighth Route Army's eastern Hebei military region, there were incidents such as four U.S. troops from Linxi entering the Liberated Area of Luan County for reconnaissance and photography on June 10; four U.S. troops from Tangshan harassing Songjiaying and other places in the Liberated Area on June 16; more than ten U.S. troops from the 52nd bridge of the Beining Railway demonstrating in Sanhezhuangzi, Luan County, in three tanks on July 11; and seven U.S. troops from Liushouying of the Beining Railway invading Xihe and Nancun in Changli, opening fire on local militia and being detained by the militia on July 13. In particular, regarding the Liushouying incident, the U.S. representative and the U.S. troops involved had formally admitted the mistake of the U.S. military invading the Liberated Area. Who knew that only half a month later, the same eastern Hebei suffered an even more serious attack by the U.S. military. This situation cannot but arouse our great vigilance.

　　Standing on the position of the Chinese people, we first demand that the U.S. Marine Corps in Tianjin apologize for the Anping Town incident, pay compensation, punish the directly responsible officers, and publicly guarantee that they will no longer invade the Liberated Areas. However, this is only a temporary solution. In order to solve the root cause, we reiterate our demand that all U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel stationed in China immediately withdraw to their country. We believe that the majority of officers and soldiers of the U.S. troops stationed in China do not want to be stationed in China inexplicably and unwelcomely, and we also believe that they have no ill will towards the Chinese people and the Chinese Liberated Areas. However, they are stationed in China, where the civil war is increasingly expanding, stationed among Kuomintang strongholds surrounded by the Liberated Areas, and cooperating so closely with the Kuomintang army. Then it is difficult for them to avoid being involved in intrusions and attacks on the Liberated Areas, and these intrusions and attacks will naturally cause legitimate self-defensive resistance. If the situation were reversed and these American officers and soldiers were in the position of the Chinese people, they would have already carried out this self-defensive resistance. The military and civilians in the Liberated Areas have tolerated the actions of the U.S. military for a long time, but no matter how tolerant we are, there is a limit. We are patriots with national self-esteem, and we also love the friendship between the two great nations of China and the the United States. Precisely to prevent this friendship from being harmed, and to prevent U.S. military officers and soldiers from being involved in the instigation and deception of Chinese reactionaries and American reactionaries, becoming their meaningless sacrifices, we demand that all U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel stationed in China immediately withdraw to their country.

　　论安平镇事件
    解放日报社论
    驻中国天津美海军陆战队巡逻队以及国民党军各一部，二十九日上午忽然巡逻到天津东北约七十公里的安平镇附近，侵入冀东八路军防地，并向当地守军攻击，守军被迫自卫，双方都有死伤；美军不但没有认错，反而实行增援，并有美空军出动配合。而国民党北平“某高级军事长官”对于外国军队在中国领土上屠杀中国人民，竟引为无上光荣，表示无上感激；对中国人民向外国军队侵略行动所实行的正当自卫，却说是“无论此事系由中共自行计划或由他人授意，同系野蛮行动”。国民党反动派显然是在竭力把美军牵入中国内战漩涡，而美军中的侵略分子也在故意投入这个漩涡，竭力向中国人民挑战。
    美军在日本投降以后在中国登陆，这件事本身已经是一个错误，已经违反要求和平的美国人民和要求回国的美国士兵的意志；美军在所谓华北遣俘任务已经结束以后，仍然留驻华北，迟迟不退，这更加是一个错误。中共和解放区的军民，公开反对美国当局的这些错误。但是为了顾全中美人民的友谊，中共和解放区军民从没有对美军采取敌对行动，而美军方面却不但露骨的和国民党站在一起，为国民党军看守港口铁路，而且往往向解放区挑衅。远的不要说，只在最近冀东一地，据八路军冀东军区发表，就有六月十日林西美军四名，进入滦县解放区侦察摄影；六月十六日，唐山美军四名到解放区宋家营等地滋扰；七月十一日，北宁路五十二号桥美军十余名，乘坦克三辆，在滦县三河庄子示威；七月十三日，北宁路留守营美军七名侵入昌黎西河、南村，向当地民兵开枪射击，被民兵扣留等事件。特别是关于留守营事件，美方代表和肇事美军本人，都曾正式承认美军侵入解放区的错误。谁知事情才过去半个月，同一个冀东，又遭受了美军更严重的进攻，这种情形不能不唤起我们的重大警惕。
    我们站在中国人民的立场上，对于安平镇事件，首先要求天津美国海军陆战队的道歉、赔偿，处分直接负责的军官，并公开保证不再向解放区侵扰。但是这只是治标的办法，为了治本，我们重申要求美国驻华一切海陆空军立即撤退回国。我们相信，驻华美军的大多数官兵并不愿意莫明其妙的、不受欢迎的驻在中国，我们也相信他们对于中国人民和中国解放区并无恶感，但是他们驻在内战正在日趋扩大的中国，驻在被解放区所包围的国民党据点中间，又和国民党军如此密切合作，那么他们是很难避免牵入对于解放区的侵扰和进攻，而这种侵扰和进攻会自然引起正当的自卫性抵抗的。如果易地而处，这些美国官兵处在中国人民的地位，他们早就进行这种自卫的抵抗了。解放区军民曾经对美军的行动容忍得很久，但是无论怎样容忍，总有个限度，我们是有民族自尊心的爱国者，我们同时也爱中美两大民族的友谊，正是为了这种友谊不被伤害，为了美军官兵不致牵入中国反动派和美国反动派的挑拨诡计，成为他们的无意义的牺牲品，我们要求驻华美国一切海陆空军立即撤退回国。
