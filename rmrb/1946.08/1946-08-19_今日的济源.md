Today's Jiyuan

After the perfidious Chiang Kai-shek troops violated the agreement and attacked Jiyuan on January 14th of this year, occupying our Potou Town (which has now been recovered), the people of Jiyuan have been on the front lines of the self-defense struggle. They have been fighting to defend themselves with one hand while actively engaging in various production and construction activities with the other. In the short period of less than a year, significant achievements have been made in various areas of work.

The flames of grievance and revenge are raging everywhere, and the struggle for rent reduction and liquidation is being carried out universally. In villages such as Maoling, Lianzhuang, and Mazhu, which are three to five miles away from Potou, the stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek troops, the struggle is being carried out vigorously, and the liberated masses have triumphed. An old lady in her sixties from Shilingtou Village tearfully expressed her heartfelt words at a mass meeting in the fifth district: "I have lived a hard life for my whole life, and no one has ever saved me. Now that the Eighth Route Army has come, Chairman Mao has finally saved me."

The people understand that in order to defend the happy life they have gained through democracy, they must bravely participate in the self-defense struggle. When Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacked Dubalian on May 14th of this year, militiamen sacrificed two lives heroically in the battle to cover the transfer of the masses. The rest rushed to the front line without hesitation and repelled the enemy's attack. The county's militia has grown to more than 4,700 people in the self-defense struggle. They seized 1,400 guns from the hands of traitors, bandits, and despots, and they have armed themselves with these weapons.

With the victory of the struggle, poor peasants have all obtained land, which has further increased their enthusiasm for production. Wushan used to have more than 20 extremely poor households, but now each person has an average of at least 1.1 mu of cultivated land. During the spring plowing season this year, the government issued agricultural loans of 5.5 million yuan and textile loans of 80 million yuan, which solved the production difficulties of the peasants and inspired their enthusiasm for production. As a result, peasants are vying to purchase draft cattle and restore cultivation. This year alone, more than 200 draft cattle have been purchased in the fifth district; Wushan has increased its draft cattle by more than 20 heads since the wheat harvest. The five famous canals, Guangji, Hongli, Guanghui, Yongli, and Ganling, which were destroyed by the enemy in the past, have now been repaired, which can increase the area of paddy fields by 2,000 mu. …

The peasants of Jiyuan all understand a simple truth: "In the past, we worked for others, but now we work for ourselves." Therefore, their actions are more active. This summer, more than 80% of the peasants have organized themselves for production, and women are also involved in the production upsurge. Women in Nan's Village participated in mutual aid teams, with six women pulling a plow to plow four mu of land a day; a woman in Dongguoluo Village cultivated more than 20 mu of land. ... In short, thanks to the victory of the struggle, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has generally increased.

After the Eighth Route Army liberated Jiyuan, it brought real democracy to the people of Jiyuan. They began to speak out and began to elect village chiefs who could really do things for everyone. Wushan was very cautious in the election. After seven days of democratic discussion, they elected Li Qingshan, a peasant leader who had been liberated and was loved by everyone, as the village chief. For thousands of years, they never dreamed that they would have today's life, where they are their own masters and elect their own village chiefs.

Now, 132 of the 169 administrative villages in the district have elected their own village chiefs through democratic elections.

Thanks to the government's active support, industry and commerce have developed greatly. There are many shops in the city, and every market town around the city and in the countryside (there are a total of 15 market towns) has no less than two or three thousand people on market days, which shows the increase in people's purchasing power. In addition, there is the development of handicrafts: there are already more than 40 flour mills and oil mills in the county; the government has invested 20 million yuan to support the resumption of the ×× coal mine, which has been shut down for a long time. All the original employees have returned to work, and the number of workers has increased greatly. The industrialist Zhai Le'an has invested 1 million yuan. Thanks to the coordination and cooperation between the trade union and the factory, the living conditions of the workers have been improved, and the production efficiency has increased by 30%. Therefore, shareholder Mr. Zhai Le'an also believes that the investment is profitable. In short, under the conditions of labor-capital coordination, Jiyuan's industry and commerce are developing day by day.

Jiyuan has been reborn. It is no longer the barren, terrible, cannibalistic world under the rule of the enemy and puppets in the past. Under the leadership of the democratic government, it has embarked on the road of peace and prosperity.

　　今日的济源
    蒋军背信弃义，于今年一月十四日违约进攻济源，侵占我坡头镇后（现已收复），济源人民即处于自卫斗争的前哨阵地，他们一手持枪自卫，一手又积极从事各种生产建设，在短短不到一年的时间内，各种工作都有显著成绩。
    诉苦复仇的火焰到处炽燃，减租清算的斗争普遍进行。在相距蒋军据点——坡头三五里地的茅岭、连庄、马柱等村，斗争轰轰烈烈的开展着，翻身的群众胜利了。石灵头村的一位六十多岁的老太太，在五区翻身大会上，感动的流着泪说出心底里的话：“我过了一辈子苦日子，谁也没有救我，现在八路军来了，毛主席才算救了我”。
    人民懂得要保卫已获得民主的幸福的生活，只有勇敢的参加自卫斗争。今年五月十四日蒋军进攻杜八联时，民兵为掩护群众转移，在作战中，曾有两名英勇牺牲，其余的则毫不犹豫的冲上火线，击退敌人的进攻。全县民兵在自卫斗争中，已发展到四千七百余人。从汉奸、土匪、恶霸的手中，他们夺回了一千四百支枪，他们又以这些武器，武装了自己。

    随着斗争的胜利，贫苦农民都得到了土地，因而生产情绪更加提高。武山过去有二十多户赤贫，现在平均每人最少有耕地一亩一分。在今年春耕时期，政府发放农业贷款五百五十万元，纺织贷款八千万元，解决了农民生产困难，启发了农民的生产积极性，因而农民争购耕牛，恢复耕作。今年仅五区购入耕牛在二百头以上；武山从麦收到现在增加耕牛二十多头。过去被敌破坏了的广吉、红利、广惠、永利，甘陵等五大名渠，现已修复。可增加水田两千亩。……
    济源农民都明白了一个浅显的道理：“从前是给别人干，现在是给自己干”。所以他们的行动是更加积极了。今夏有百分之八十以上的农民组织起来进行生产，妇女亦卷入生产热潮。南石村的妇女参加互助组，六个妇女用人拉犁，一天犁地四亩；东郭洛村有一妇女种地二十多亩。……总之，由于斗争的胜利，农民的生产热情普遍提高。

    八路军解放了济源以后，给济源人民带来了真正的民主。他们开始张嘴说话，开始选举真正能为大家办事的村长。武山在选举中是非常慎重的，经过了七天的民主讨论，他们选出了为大家所爱戴的农民翻身领袖李青山为村长。几千年他们做梦都没有想到会有今天的日子，他们自己做主人，自己选村长。
    现在，全区一百六十九个行政村，已有一百三十二个行政村经过民主选举的方式，选举了自己的村长。
    由于政府的积极扶持，工商业有了很大发展。城内商店林立，城周围的乡村集镇，每逢集日，每一个集镇（共有十五个集镇），都不下两三千人，这说明了人民购买力的提高。除此则是手工业的发展：全县已有四十多座粉房和油房；政府以两千万元扶植久已停工的××煤矿复业，原有的职员已全体复工，工人已大大增加，工业家翟乐安投资一百万元。由于工会与厂方的协调与合作，工人生活得到改善，生产效率提高了百分之三十。因而股东翟乐安先生也认为投资是有利可图的。总之，在劳资协调的情况下，济源的工商业日益发展。
    济源已经新生了，它已经不是过去敌伪统治时那种荒芜可怕的人吃人的世界，在民主政府的领导下，它已走上和平繁荣的道路。
