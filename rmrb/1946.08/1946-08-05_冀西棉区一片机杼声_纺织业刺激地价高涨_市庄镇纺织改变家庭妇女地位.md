Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 2nd - The weaving industry is extremely prosperous in the cotton-producing areas of western Hebei. According to incomplete statistics, the number of wooden and iron looms in Tangxian, Quyang, Wangdu, Yixian, and Dingxian counties has increased to more than 16,000. During the slack farming seasons of spring and winter, it can produce more than 576,000 bolts of cloth. Even during the busy farming season, a large number of rural women are engaged in textile work. The development of the textile industry has gradually eliminated the disparity between the prices of industrial and agricultural products, stimulated a sharp increase in agricultural production funds, and farmers have purchased land to expand production. This has stimulated higher land prices. For example, in the Daxihe Village, a prosperous weaving area, the price of land per mu has risen to more than 60,000 yuan this spring, while in the neighboring Zhuanlu Village, which is not a cloth-producing area, it is only more than 20,000 yuan per mu. In Hongzhen, the center of the Quyang textile industry, the price of land per mu is as high as 20,000 yuan, while in the adjacent Daqiqiu it is only more than 12,000 yuan.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 2nd - In Shizhuang Township, in the liberated area east of Dingxian city on the Pinghan Railway, all young and middle-aged women have participated in textile production. There is almost one loom per household and one spinning wheel per person. A reporter recently passed through the town and conducted a survey of three alleys. There were a total of 51 households with 49 looms and 108 spinning wheels, with more than 100 women engaged in spinning and weaving. In several farm households visited, many of the heads of the household were young women. A young woman named Meishu told reporters: "If women wait for men to bring food like in the old society, then they shouldn't even think about truly raising their status. But like us today, able to spin, weave, and work in the fields, men not only don't look down on us, but they also have to respect us!" Her income from weaving cloth in the spring was more than 20,000 yuan and more than ten bags of grain, which is equal to half of her husband's annual agricultural production income. Jin Guihe, the head of another happy farming family, and his wife and three children all wore new socks and trousers made of fine white cloth. Jin Guihe said that the reason for the rise in his family's economy was largely due to his wife's hard work in textile production. Last year, the family's cotton clothing, rations, and this summer's single clothing were all earned from textile work, and they also bought some new farm tools. Many of the local government and cooperative staff are now women.

　　冀西棉区一片机杼声
    纺织业刺激地价高涨         
    市庄镇纺织改变家庭妇女地位
    【新华社张家口二日电】河北西部产棉区织布业极盛。据不完全统计：唐县、曲阳、望都、易县、定县六县铁木布机，现已增至一万六千余张，春冬两季农闲可产布五十七万六千余匹，即是农忙季节亦有大批农妇专事纺织。由于纺织业发达，使工农业产品价格之悬殊形势逐渐消除，促使农业生产资金剧增，农民纷纷购置土地扩大生产。因此，刺激地价提高，如织布繁盛区大西河村，今春每亩地价已涨至六万余元，而邻近非产布区砖路村每亩只二万余元。曲阳纺织业中心洪镇每亩地价达二万余元，相接壤的大起邱只有一万二千余元。
    【新华社河间二日电】平汉路定县城东解放区的市庄镇，青壮年妇女已全部参加纺织，几达每户一张织机，每人一辆纺车。记者日前路经该镇进行了三条胡同的调查，共计有五十一家有织机四十九张，纺车一百零八辆，纺织妇女达百余人。在所访问的几家农户中，发现不少当家者均为青年妇女。一个名梅树的青年妇女告诉记者：“妇女们要是像在旧社会等着男人拿吃的来，那就不要想真正提高自己的地位，可是像我们今天，能纺、能织、能下地，那男人们不用说轻视，还得敬着点呢！”她春季织布已收入二万多元和十来口袋粮食，等于她丈夫全年农业生产收入的一半。另一家美满的农民家庭主人金贵和，及他老婆三个孩子，都穿着白细布的新袜裤，金贵和说：他家经济上升的原因，大半均得力于他媳妇的辛勤纺织，去年全家的棉衣、口粮和今夏的单衣，都是靠纺织赚来的，另外还置了一些新农具。该地政民干部合作社人员，很多已由妇女担任起来。
