　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: Beiping dispatch: Regarding the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft bombing of Yan'an on the 2nd of this month, General Ye Jianying, the Chinese Communist Party member of the Military Mediation Department, lodged a strong protest with the Kuomintang member Zheng Jiemin on the 5th, and informed the US member Lubeson. The protest demanded that the Military Mediation Department immediately order a halt to the Kuomintang Air Force's atrocities, investigate the details of the atrocities, and punish those responsible for the bombing of Yan'an. General Ye solemnly stated: Yan'an is the location of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army, and is also a peaceful city far from conflict zones. Therefore, there is no other reason to explain the Kuomintang Air Force's bombing of Yan'an other than to indicate that the Kuomintang side is determined to import an all-out civil war and undermine any political negotiations. He therefore requested the Military Mediation Department to pay serious attention to this matter and promptly report it to the Nanjing Three-Person Committee in order to urgently seek to stop the Kuomintang side's actions of completely breaking down and instigating an all-out civil war.
　　[This newspaper, Weixian, August 8th dispatch] The Joint Federation of Workers, Peasants, and Women of Southern Hebei, upon hearing of the Chiang Kai-shek planes indiscriminately bombing Yan'an, were filled with indignation. They represent the eight million people of Central Hebei in telegraphing the entire country, warning the reactionary factions of China and the United States, and calling on the people of the whole country to urgently mobilize and swiftly stop Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of slaughtering the Chinese people. The people of China and the United States must unite to stop the American reactionary faction from armed interference in China's internal affairs.

    要求军调部制止蒋空军暴行
　　【新华社延安八日电】北平讯：军调部中共委员叶剑英将军为本月二日蒋机轰炸延安事，于五日向国民党委员郑介民提出严重抗议，并转知美方委员鲁伯森。抗议书中要求军调部立即下令制止国民党空军暴行，调查暴行经过，并处分轰炸延安的负责人员。叶将军郑重声明：延安为中共中央及八路军总部所在地，且为远离冲突地区的和平城市，因此国民党空军轰炸延安除表示国民党方面已决心进口全面内战与破坏任何政治商谈外，别无其他理由可资说明。以此要求军调部严重注意此事，并速呈报南京三人委员会，以便亟谋制止国民党方面全面破裂全面内战的行为。
    【本报威县八日电】冀南工、农、妇联合会，听到蒋机无不轰炸延安，莫不愤慨填膺，代表冀中八百万人民供电全国，警告中美反动派，并呼吁全国人民急急动员起来，迅速制止蒋介石屠杀中国人民之罪行，中美人民一致起来，阻止美国反动派武装干涉中国内政。
