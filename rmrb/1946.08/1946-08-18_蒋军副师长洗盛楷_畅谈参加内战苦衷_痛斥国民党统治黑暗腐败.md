Xinhua News Agency, Huaibei, 12th—Major General Xi Shengkai, Deputy Division Commander of the Chiang Army’s 92nd Division, who laid down his arms in the Chaoyangji battle of Yugou County, Suining, east of the Jinpu Railway in Huaibei last month on the 25th, recently expressed his thoughts to a reporter from this agency. Xi stated: “I feel extremely pained by participating in this meaningless civil war. Now that I am an ordinary citizen who has left the battlefield and laid down my arms, I feel relieved. Here, I would like to express my personal feelings as a citizen. After the Political Consultative Conference, our country could have embarked on peaceful construction, but due to the insistence of a few people in the Kuomintang on dictatorship, attempting to rule China as ‘Party Emperors,’ especially the actions of the two Chens (Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu), the two Gus (Gu Zhenggang, Gu Zhengding), Liang Han Cao, and others in attempting to overturn the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference at the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, were even more obvious. After the Second Plenary Session, I personally believed that the country would be troubled from then on, and civil war would be unavoidable. My division was ordered to depart from Wuxi lightly armed. I repeatedly requested retirement to care for my 78-year-old mother, but was not granted permission. Soon after arriving in Suxian, I was ordered to attack the New Fourth Army to the east. At this point, my division was plunged into the vortex of civil war, but I personally was extremely unwilling to participate in the civil war. During the Yugou battle, when I heard the sound of civil war gunfire, my mood immediately plummeted. Chief of Staff Liu asked me about the army's advance or retreat. I immediately advocated staying in place. When the order was disrupted, the guards asked how we should handle it. I immediately ordered us to lay down our arms. Most of the officers and soldiers in my division were extremely diligent in the War of Resistance against Japan and were awarded the four characters ‘hold the position and do not retreat.’ The main reason for laying down arms this time was that the officers and soldiers were tired of war and unwilling to make meaningless sacrifices. Everyone asked for retirement during the reorganization, and this time they finally found an opportunity to go home. As for the dark and corrupt domestic politics (referring to the Kuomintang-controlled areas), I had long been dissatisfied with them. The Kuomintang had long lost its revolutionary spirit after the Northern Expedition. Under the control of the two Chens, the two Gus, and a group of ‘Party Emperors,’ the bureaucracy was corrupt, corruption was rampant, secret agents were everywhere, industry was devastated, and the people were living in poverty. Recently, they have even gone so far as to sell out customs and navigation rights in exchange for military aid, allowing Americans to rampage everywhere, with American goods flooding the market, like the Japanese invaders before the war. I have long been pessimist about the future of the Kuomintang, believing that the Kuomintang authorities have abandoned the legacy of the Premier in the past ten years and more, and it is no longer worthy of being called a political party, but merely a tyrannical group of a few people. And today, the worldwide trend is towards peace and democracy, which will never allow one-party dictatorship, let alone civil war to consume national power. The Kuomintang's civil war policy is simply a policy of suicide and self-destruction. From the perspective of economic, financial, food, and human resource mobilization, the Kuomintang-controlled areas have reached a state of financial exhaustion, food depletion, and exhaustion of soldiers and people, and cannot support a long-term civil war. On the other hand, the Liberated Areas mobilize the masses to implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition of 'land to the tiller,' and the army and people are united in stepping up production and construction. This kind of force cannot be destroyed by any weapon. I advocate the immediate establishment of a coalition government of all parties and factions to jointly discuss national affairs. I believe that if there is a coalition government composed of representatives of all parties, factions, circles, and armies across the country, China will not fight a civil war again. Now I hope that the people of the whole country will unite as one and quickly stop the tragedy of a few people massacring the majority of the people!"

　　蒋军副师长洗盛楷
    畅谈参加内战苦衷
    痛斥国民党统治黑暗腐败
    【新华社淮北十二日电】上月二十五日在淮北津浦路东睢宁县渔沟朝阳集战役中放下武器之蒋军九十二师副师长洗盛楷少将顷对本社记者发表感想。洗氏表示：“此次参加无谓之内战，内心极感痛苦。现在已是离开战场放下武器的老百姓了，倒觉得轻松。在此愿以国民资格谈谈个人各种感慨。从政治协商会议以后，我国本可进行和平建设，但由于国民党少数人坚持独裁，企图假‘党皇帝’统治中国，特别是二陈（陈果夫、陈立夫）二谷（谷正纲、谷正鼎）梁寒操等在国民党二中全会上企图推翻政协决议，更为明显。二中全会以后，个人认为国家从此多事，内战必不可免，本师奉命从无锡轻装出发，个人屡请退伍，奉侍七十八岁老母，均未得准。到宿县不久，复奉命向东进攻新四军，至此本师即陷入内战漩涡，但本人心内极不愿参加内战，此次渔沟战役中，听到内战枪声一响，我心绪即降到冰点。刘参谋长问我军进退如何？我即主张留在原地。当秩序紊乱时，卫士问我们如何处理？我即下令放下武器。本师中大多数官兵在抗战中均极奋勉，曾被奖以‘守阵不退’四字，此次放下武器的主要原因是官兵厌战，不愿作无谓之牺牲。大家整编时就纷纷要求退伍，这次才找到了一个回家的机会。至于国内政治（按指国民党统治地区）黑暗腐败早为我所不满，国民党从北伐以后早已失去革命精神，在二陈二谷一班‘党皇帝’把持下，官僚腐化，贪污成风，特务如毛，产业残败，民不聊生。最近更不惜出卖海关、航权，换得军事援助，让美国人到处横冲直撞，美货充斥市场，有如战前日寇侵犯中国之势。我对于国民党的前途早已消极悲观，认为国民党当局近十多年来已抛弃了总理的遗教，已不称其为政党，仅是少数人专横的集团。而在今天全世界潮流都趋向和平民主，决不容一党专政，更不容打内战消耗国力。国民党的内战政策，只是自杀自溃政策。从经济财粮人力动员上说，国民党统治地区已至财枯粮竭，兵疲民困之境，决不能长期支持内战。反观解放区，发动民众实行中山先生‘耕者有其田’的主张，军民团结一致加紧生产建设，这种力量是任何武器所消灭不了的。我主张立即成立各党各派的联合政府，共商国是。我相信如果有了由全国各党各派各界各军代表组织的联合政府，中国就不致再打内战。现在我希望全国军民一致团结起来，迅速制止少数人残杀大多数人民的惨剧！”
