Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: The Suwan Border Region Temporary Council, in order to expose the truth about the Kuomintang reactionaries' creation of the so-called "Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group" to coordinate with military offensives, and to call on those who have been deceived and exploited to awaken and return, has issued a letter to compatriots from Northern Jiangsu living in Southern Jiangsu. It first pointed out: "Recently, the Kuomintang reactionaries have used the so-called 'Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group's' return to their hometowns, which they themselves orchestrated, as an excuse to attack the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area, attempting to cover up their crime of launching a civil war. The Kuomintang reactionaries constantly shout about 'refugees returning home' and 'relieving refugees,' but in fact, they have seized vehicles and ships across the country to transport troops, ammunition, and military supplies to carry out a civil war. Tens of thousands of homeless refugees wandering in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and other places are unable to return home because they have no vehicles or ships. In Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and other provinces, there are more than 40 million disaster victims. What is the reactionary faction's relief situation? Even in our Northern Jiangsu area, due to the continuous mopping-up and 'clearing the villages' by the enemy and puppets in the past, coupled with the floods and insect plagues last year, a serious famine occurred this spring. Apart from the local democratic government's efforts to rescue, the Kuomintang authorities not only provided no relief but also tried to swallow and withhold the UNRRA relief supplies that should have been allocated to the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area. This is the reactionary faction's true attitude towards refugees across the country and refugees in Northern Jiangsu."

The letter then analyzes the composition of those who control the so-called "Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group": "The first are the big and small traitors who surrendered to the Japanese devils in the past, and the secret service agents who committed crimes. Some of them, knowing that they cannot be tolerated by the law of the country, fled to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, willingly acting as pawns of the reactionaries. Isn't Tao Guanxian, the director of the 'Northern Jiangsu Refugee Reception Center' in Yangzhou, the former councilor of Sun Gencheng, the traitor of the puppet Fifth Army? Among those received, aren't there also Xu Ganchen, the former adjutant director of the puppet 33rd Division, Yuan Tieshi, the puppet brigade commander, and many puppet officials and soldiers? Isn't Yuan Jiehou, the director of the 'Northern Jiangsu Refugee Reception Center' in Zhenjiang, the former war criminal who partnered with a puppet division commander Ding in Yangzhou to open a money shop and make a fortune from the national crisis? Second, some people have been deceived by the reactionary faction's propaganda and shameless rumors, and dare not return to their hometowns, and are being used. Third, some are genuine refugees who originally came from Northern Jiangsu but have lost their jobs and educational opportunities under the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, with no way out. Apart from a very few, most of these three groups are kind compatriots who have been temporarily deceived and exploited by the reactionary faction. Although they have unfortunately been dragged into the quagmire, their lives and their circumstances deserve our infinite sympathy." The letter pointed out: "The army and people in the Suwan Liberated Area have sufficient self-defense forces to smash the reactionary faction's offensive. We hope that they will not become the reactionary faction's senseless sacrifices, and sincerely call on those who have been deceived and exploited to awaken and return: 'You should jump out of the cage and return to your hometowns as soon as possible. We dare to guarantee with our lives that you will receive the same legal protection from the democratic government. Similarly, the democratic government will provide relief and help you settle down and produce, and solve various difficulties in your life. For those who have done some wrong to society and the people in the past but are not guilty of heinous crimes, as long as you repent and start anew, and are no longer used by the reactionary faction, the democratic government will be magnanimous and not hold the past against you. You can also return to your hometowns and live and work in peace and contentment.'" Finally, it shouted: "Compatriots in Suwan, unite to oppose the civil war! Oppose the reactionary faction's deception of Northern Jiangsu compatriots to participate in the civil war! Welcome the 'Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group' to turn around and defend the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area! Defend national peace!"

    致书江南苏北同胞            
    揭发国民党苏北难民团真象号召被骗利用分子觉醒来归
    【新华社延安八日电】苏皖边区临参会为揭发国民党反动派配合军事进攻制造所谓“苏北难民团”的真象，并号召被欺骗利用者的觉悟来归，特发表告旅江南的苏北同胞书。首先指出：“最近国民党反动派利用他们一手导演的所谓‘苏北难民团’的还乡，把这作为进攻苏北解放区的借口，企图以此掩盖他们发动内战的罪恶。国民党反动派口里成天喊着：“难民还乡”和“救济难民”，事实上他们强占了全国的车辆和船只，运兵运军火和军用物资以进行内战。而流浪在重庆成都昆明等地若干万无家可归的难胞，则因为没有车船而无法还乡。四川、湖南、江西、广西等省灾胞在四千万以上，反动派救济的情形究竟怎样呢？就是在我苏北地区由于过去敌伪不断扫荡清乡又加上去年的水灾和虫灾，以致今年春天发生了严重的灾荒现象。除了这里的民主政府尽力抢救外，国民党当局不但没有什么救济，反而对苏北解放区应该分得的联总救济物资亦多方加以吞没扣留，这就是反动派对全国难民与苏北难民的真实态度。”
    该书继分析所谓“苏北难民团”操纵者的成份：第一个是过去投降日本鬼子的大小汉奸，和为非作恶的特务分子，他们有的自知不容于国法，逃到国民党统治地区，甘心做反动派的爪牙。最近在扬州作“苏北难民收容所”所长的陶管贤不就是曾经干过伪第五军孙逆艮诚的参议吗？所收容的不是还有伪三十三师副官主任徐逆干臣和伪旅长袁逆铁石以及许多伪官伪兵吗？在镇江任“苏北难民收容所”所长的袁介侯，不就是过去和伪师长丁某在扬州合伙开设钱庄发了国难财的汉奸战犯吗？第二、有一部分人是受了反动派的欺骗宣传和无耻造谣的影响，不敢回到家乡，而被利用的。第三、一部分原籍苏北，因在国民党反动派黑暗统治下失业失学，毫无出路的真正难胞。以上三部分人，除了极少数外，大多数是一时受反动派欺骗利用的善良同胞，他们虽不幸被拖进了泥坑，而他们的生活，他们的境遇，是值得我们寄予无限同情的”。该书指出：“苏皖解放区军民有充分的自卫力量，足以粉碎反动派的进攻。希望他们不要做反动派的无谓牺牲品，并诚恳地号召被欺骗被利用的人们觉悟来归：“你们赶快跳出牢笼回到自己的家乡来，我们敢以身家性命担保你们能同样受到民主政府的法律保障。同样的，民主政府会救济帮助你们安家生产，解决生活上的各种困难。对于那些过去曾经有一些对不起社会和人民而并非罪大恶极的人们，只要你们悔过自新，不再受反动派利用，民主政府是宽大为怀不咎既往的。你们同样可以回到家乡安居乐业。”最后，高呼：“苏皖同胞团结起来反对内战！反对反动派欺骗苏北同胞参加内战！欢迎“苏北难民团”回转头来保卫苏北解放区！保卫全国和平！”
