[From Our Newspaper in Heze on the 25th] The Joint General Association of Workers, Peasants, Youth, and Women and the General Association of Martial Committees of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region recently published a letter to all members, league members, and militiamen, calling on the people of the entire region to mobilize immediately to participate in the war of self-defense and repulse the attacks of the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The original text is summarized as follows:

Comrades of the Workers', Peasants', Youth, and Women's Associations, militiamen, and members of the Children's Corps:

Chiang Kai-shek is afraid that we will have land to cultivate and food to eat, and he won't let us live a good life. He has turned to the American reactionaries and is attacking our liberated areas. To love our country and defend ourselves, we must mobilize immediately, join the army and participate in the war, unite the military and civilians, defend the border areas, and strive for peace at an early date. (1) Our young workers, peasants, and militiamen should take the lead in joining the army, and women members and Children's Corps members should serve as models in persuading their husbands, fathers, and brothers to join the army. (2) Workers, peasants, youth, women members, and militiamen should actively participate in the war, undertaking various war support tasks such as guarding, delivering messages, and comforting the troops. (3) Workers, peasants, youth, women members, militiamen, and Children's Corps members at home should lead the masses of the whole village in doing a good job of giving preferential treatment to military families and families of those participating in the war or on business trips. Help with the autumn harvest, wheat planting, fetching water, grinding flour, and organizing temporary mutual aid groups. (4) Union members should step up production to supply the front lines. Print more propaganda to let everyone know the victory news and what should be done at any time. (5) After the war mobilization work is completed, continue to mobilize the masses for mutual aid production. Let's all mobilize together to the end, and victory will surely be ours.

[Another Dispatch] The party, government, military, and civilians in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border area are supporting the front lines with active work enthusiasm. Since the beginning of the war of self-defense, the heads of various leading organs have set off separately to go deep into various sub-districts to assist in the work, and the responsible cadres of various counties and districts have personally organized and led the masses to rush to the front lines. After holding a meeting of district cadres, Gaoling County discussed work and current affairs issues, overcame ideological slackness and paralysis, and decided to mobilize the majority of the masses within a month to thoroughly overturn the old order, so that the land problem could be reasonably resolved, and the landless or land-poor peasants would have land to cultivate and food to eat. Linze County seized the gap in the war and continued to deepen mass mobilization, deciding to thoroughly resolve the peasants' land problem. In order to do a good job of supporting the front lines, Puyang County established a command post from the county to the district and village levels, divided into four sections: supply, transportation, security, and reception. Each village organized cart teams, wheelbarrow teams, and stretcher groups. The entire county has now been fully mobilized. In order for the people in the newly liberated areas to be able to read the newspapers, the newspaper printing team of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Printing Bureau has increased the daily printing of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily by 2,000 copies. The work that used to be done by 24 people can now be completed on time by 16 people. Propaganda and education cadres from various departments in the Fifth District of Juancheng strengthened their study of current affairs in order to complete the current urgent tasks, to improve their work ability, and stipulate that monthly tests will be implemented. The masses in Anlingji, Heze, are concerned about current affairs, and merchants have automatically organized five newspaper reading groups, reading newspapers on the streets every afternoon. After listening to Mr. Soong Ching Ling's statement, the masses said in unison: "The wife of the Kuomintang teacher is against Old Chiang fighting a civil war, it seems that Old Chiang will not last long."
