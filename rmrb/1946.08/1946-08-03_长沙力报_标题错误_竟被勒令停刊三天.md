Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Changsha dispatch: The local Li Bao was ordered by the Kuomintang authorities to suspend publication for three days on the 6th of this month. This was because the newspaper published a news item on the 5th stating that "The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense is establishing military communication groups in various regions." The headline included the phrase "Strengthening Civil War Propaganda," which was deemed an "incorrect headline," and resulted in the suspension. It is reported that the authorities had long been dissatisfied with the newspaper's past reports on events such as "Jiaochangkou," "Cangbaitang," and the "Xiaguan Massacre." This forced suspension is considered a "slight punishment."

　　长沙力报“标题错误”竟被勒令停刊三天
    【新华社延安三十日电】长沙讯：此间力报于本月六日被国民党当局勒令停刊三天，因该报于五日刊载“国防部新闻局在各地设立军事通讯组”的新闻，在标题上冠以“加强内战宣传”一语，遂被指为“标题错误”，而施以停刊处分。据闻该报过去报导“较场口”“沧白堂”“下关惨案”等事件之消息，早已为当局所不满，此次强迫停刊，尚属“聊示薄惩”云。
