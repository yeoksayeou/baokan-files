　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: The British and Americans are at loggerheads over the Palestine issue. According to a United Press report on the 6th, the British government's plan to establish a Palestinian federation has been rejected by the United States. Truman said he was not favorably impressed with the British plan. On the same day, Reuters reported that Attlee was preparing to reject the U.S. proposal to move 100,000 Jews into Palestine. Reuters claimed that the federal plan and the immigration plan were inseparable. Since the United States rejected the British plan, Britain would naturally reject the American plan as well. An August 8th New York Times Washington correspondent reported, "The British government has notified the United States that it will no longer allow illegal immigrants to Palestine. From now on, Britain will deport all illegal immigrants to the island of Cyprus." This note was issued after the British cabinet discussed the Palestine issue on the 7th. The British cabinet also decided: (1) Under no circumstances will it abandon its mandate over Palestine. (2) Even if the United States refuses to assist, Britain will complete the "federal plan" alone. According to the U.S. News Service, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson, Secretary of the Army Patterson, and Secretary of the Treasury Snyder held a meeting on the 7th to discuss the British attitude. The meeting concluded on the 8th without a decision. It is understood that the British plan for a Palestinian federation was drafted in late July. The plan agreed to the U.S. suggestion to move 100,000 Jews into Palestine and advocated dividing Palestine into two autonomous states governed separately by Jews and Arabs, with two conditions attached: (1) The two autonomous states should be under British jurisdiction. (2) The United States should allocate $250 million to various Arab countries in the Middle East. According to British newspapers, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and the Anglo-American Committee of Experts on Palestine have agreed to the plan, but Truman changed his attitude due to opposition from some American financial capitalists.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: According to a combined report from the Associated Press, the British Navy and Air Force blockaded and intercepted 15,000 European Jewish immigrants on the 9th who were attempting to secretly enter Palestine. In order to deter the Jewish immigration movement, three British destroyers patrolled the coast of Palestine, while air force planes observed various ports on the Adriatic coast. It is believed that the intercepted Jews were sent to the island of Cyprus and temporarily placed in concentration camps.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 10th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Jerusalem, the Arab League stated that the Arabs did not agree with either the British federal plan or the American immigration plan. The League declared on the 9th, "The Arabs have a very strong aversion to the United States' support for Jewish terrorism and open aggression against Palestine." It also stated that all but one of the Arab League countries opposed the plan to partition Palestine. The federal plan is a British plan to maintain its control over Palestine by dividing the Jewish and Arab populations, while the immigration plan is one of the expansion plans of American financial capital forces.

　　巴勒斯坦问题陷僵局  
    美方拒绝英国联邦计划英海空军阻止犹太移民  
    阿拉伯人反对英美侵略政策
    【新华社延安十一日电】英美在巴勒斯坦问题上已闹僵。据合众社六日报导：英政府建立巴勒斯坦联邦的计划已遭美方拒绝，杜鲁门说他对英国这一计划印象颇为不佳。同日路透社报导：艾德礼正准备拒绝美方提议的将十万犹太人移入巴勒斯坦的计划。路透社称：联邦计划与移民计划是不可分割的，既然美国拒绝英方的计划，英国自然也将拒绝美国的计划。八日纽约时报华盛顿记者电称：“英政府业已通知美国，不允许再非法往巴勒斯坦移发难民，此后英国将把所有不合法的移民遣禁塞浦路斯岛。”此项照会，是英内阁七日讨论巴勒斯坦问题后发出的。英内阁并决定：（一）无论如何不放弃对巴勒斯坦的委任统治权。（二）甚至美国拒绝协助时，英国亦将单独完成“联邦计划”。据美新闻处讯：美代理国务卿亚泽逊、陆长柏德逊及财长斯尼德等于七日召开会议，讨论英国的态度，会议至八日告一段落，未作出决定。按英国的巴勒斯坦联邦计划，系于七月下旬拟出，该计划同意美国关于移十万犹太人入巴勒斯坦的建议，主张把巴勒斯坦分为犹太人与阿拉伯人分治的两个自治邦，惟附有两个条件，即：（一）此二自治邦应在英国管辖下。（二）由美国拨款二万五千万美元予中东各阿拉伯国家。据英报称：美国务卿贝纳斯与英美巴勒斯坦专家委员会已同意该计划，但由于一部分美国金融资本家的反对，杜鲁门乃改变态度。
    【新华社延安十一日电】据合社众电：英国海空军封锁并于九日截获企图秘密进入巴勒斯坦的欧洲犹太移民一万五千人，为了阻遏犹太人的移民运动，英三艘驱逐舰巡逻巴勒斯坦海岸，空军飞机则观察亚得里亚海岸各港口。咸信被截获的犹太人，被送往塞浦路斯岛，暂置于集中营。
    【新华社延安十日电】据路透社耶路撒冷讯：阿拉伯联盟表示：阿拉伯人既不同意英国的联邦计划，也不同意美国的移民计划。该联盟九日宣称：“阿拉伯对于美国的支持犹太恐怖主义及公开侵略巴勒斯坦具有极强烈的反感。”又称：阿拉伯联盟各国除一个以外，都反对分治巴勒斯坦的计划。按联邦计划为英国欲以分治回犹两族，保持其对巴勒斯坦控制的计划，移民计划为美国财政资本势力的扩张计划之一。
