Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 13th, announcing that the Soviet Union has formally requested Turkey to revise the Montreux Convention. The statement said: This action by the Soviet Union is based on the decision of the Three-Power Berlin Conference. The Soviet Ambassador to Turkey submitted a note to the Turkish government on the 13th, pointing out that the Montreux Convention failed to prevent German and its vassal ships from using the Black Sea Straits against the Allies during the war, and the Turkish government should be responsible for this. The Soviet government proposes to revise the Montreux Convention based on the following principles:

　　(1) The Black Sea Straits should be open to the navigation of merchant ships of all countries. (2) The Black Sea Straits should be permanently open to the passage of warships of Black Sea countries. (3) Warships of non-Black Sea countries shall not be allowed to pass through the Straits except in special circumstances. (4) The system for managing the Black Sea Straits should belong to Turkey and other Black Sea countries. (5) Turkey and the Soviet Union are very concerned about and able to guarantee the safety and navigation of the Black Sea Straits, and they should jointly organize the defense of the Straits so that other Black Sea countries can use the Straits. The announcement concluded by saying that the Soviet Union has notified the British and American governments of this matter. The Turkish side has not yet responded to the Soviet note.

　　Note: The Montreux Convention was signed on July 20, 1936, for a period of ten years, which expires this year. The signatory countries include ten countries: Britain, France, Japan, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Australia. Because the convention was signed in the Turkish city of Montreux, it is named the Montreux Convention. The main content of the treaty is to stipulate the methods for warships of Black Sea coastal countries and non-Black Sea coastal countries to pass through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits under Turkish jurisdiction. Because the Montreux Conference was manipulated by reactionary elements of Britain and France, the convention has anti-Soviet characteristics, manifested in: (1) Limiting the tonnage of Soviet ships entering and leaving the straits during peacetime; (2) Allowing warships of non-Black Sea countries to pass through the straits and enter the Black Sea; (3) Pulling countries that have nothing to do with the import and export of the straits into the signatory countries of the convention; (4) Ships of countries that are hostile to Britain and France shall not be allowed to pass through the straits in the event of war.

　　苏联根据柏林会议决定
    要求修改蒙特娄公约       
    已向土耳其政府提出照会
    【新华社延安十四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联外交部于十三日发表公告，宣布苏联已正式向土耳其要求修改蒙特娄公约。公告内称：苏联这一行动是根据三强柏林会议的决定的。苏驻土大使已于十三日向土政府提出照会，指出战争中蒙特娄公约并未能阻止德国及其附庸的舰船利用黑海海峡以反对盟国，土政府对此应负责。苏联政府提议根据下列原则重新修改蒙特娄公约：
    （１）黑海海峡应开放让各国商船航行。（２）黑海海峡经常开放让黑海各国军舰通行。（３）非黑海国的军舰除特殊情形外不准通过海峡。（４）管理黑海海峡制度应属于土耳其及其他黑海国的权利。（５）土耳其与苏联十分关心并且能够保证黑海海峡的安全与通航，他们应以共同力量组织海峡防卫，以使黑海其他国家利用海峡。公告末称：苏联已将此事通知英美政府。苏对土照会尚未得到土方答复。
    按：蒙特娄公约签订于一九三六年七月二十日，期限为十年，今年期满，参加的签字国计有英、法、日、苏、土、保、希、南、罗、澳等十国。因公约签订于土耳其的蒙特娄城，故名为蒙特娄公约。该约的主要内容在于规定黑海沿岸与非黑海沿岸各国军舰通过土属达达尼尔与博斯普鲁斯两海峡的办法，由于蒙特娄会议为英法两国反动份子所操纵，因而该公约便具备了反苏的特点，表现在：（一）限制苏联平时出入海峡船只的吨数；（二）非黑海国家的军舰也通过海峡进入黑海；（三）把与海峡进出口毫无关系的国家也拉到公约签字国里来；（四）战争发生时与英法敌对的国家之舰船，不得通过海峡。
