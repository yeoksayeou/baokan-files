　  Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Security Commander Issues Statement
    Protesting Chiang Kai-shek Aircraft's Atrocious Bombing of Yan'an
    If Reactionaries Invade Our Border Region, They Will Be Met with Crushing Blows
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] General Wang Shitai, Commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Security, and General Yan Kuiyao, Deputy Commander, issued a statement to reporters regarding the bombing of Yan'an by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft on the 2nd: "The fact that the Kuomintang authorities sent aircraft to bomb Yan'an clearly shows their determination to provoke a nationwide civil war. All officers and soldiers of our border region troops express their resolute protest against this unreasonable atrocity. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the military and civilians of the border region made great contributions in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources to support the front lines, rendering meritorious service to the nation and the people. Not only did they not receive any rewards or supplies of weapons or ammunition from the Kuomintang government, but they also suffered strict blockades, several attacks, and various disturbances by Kuomintang agents. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the border region troops are actively implementing reorganization and demobilization in accordance with the military reorganization plan adopted by the Political Consultative Conference, and working together with the people of the border region to strive for peaceful construction. However, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have never stopped their blockade and harassment of our border. Since the ceasefire order in January, they have continuously sent aircraft to Yan'an for reconnaissance and harassment, and this time they brazenly carried out bombing, disrupting the peace of our border region's military and civilians and disrupting order, which is a common resentment among the military and civilians of our border region. We fully support the statement made by the spokesperson of the Yan'an Headquarters, demanding that the Kuomintang authorities offer compensation and apology, and we further demand that those who masterminded the bombing of Yan'an be punished." Commanders Wang and Yan further stated: "Our border region's military and civilians are conscious and organized, united as one, and determined to defend China's independence, peace, and democracy, and resolutely defend the peaceful and democratic construction of the border region people. Any reactionary who dares to attack the border region will be resolutely defended against together with all the people of the border region, and will be met with crushing blows."

　  陕甘宁保安司令发表声明            
    抗议蒋机袭延暴行       
    反动派如犯我边区将予粉碎打击
    【新华社延安七日电】陕甘宁边区保安司令王世泰将军、副司令阎揆要将军，对于二日蒋机轰炸延安事，对记者发表声明：“国民党当局派飞机轰炸延安，其决心挑起全国规模的内战已很显然，我边区部队全体将士对此无理暴行，一致表示坚决抗议。八年抗战中，边区军民曾付出了极大的人力物力财力支持前线，功在国家民族，非但没有受到国民党政府的奖励和一枪一弹的接济，反遭受严密的封锁，几次的进攻和国民党特务的种种扰乱。抗战胜利后，边区部队正在按照政协会所通过的整军方案决议，积极实行整编复员，与边区人民共同努力和平建设，但蒋介石军队却一天也没有停止对我边境的封锁骚扰。一月停战令以来，更不断派飞机来延安侦察扰乱，而这次竟悍然施行轰炸，破坏我边区军民和平，扰乱秩序，实为我边区军民所共愤。我们完全拥护延安总部发言人谈话，要求国民党当局赔偿道歉，我们更要求惩办轰炸延安的主谋者。”王、阎正副司令并称：“我们边区军民有觉悟有组织，团结一致，坚决保卫中国的独立和平与民主，坚决保卫边区人民的和平民主建设，任何反动派要求进攻边区，我们就要和全边区人民一起坚决自卫，给予粉碎的打击。”
