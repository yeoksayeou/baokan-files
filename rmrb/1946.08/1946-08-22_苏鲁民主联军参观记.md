A Visit to the Democratic Allied Forces of Jiangsu and Shandong

On July 7th, I, as a reporter, accompanied General Wang Shuwen, Deputy Commander of the Democratic Allied Forces of Jiangsu and Shandong, on a special trip to visit the various units of the Allied Forces. Our first destination was the rear guard headquarters. As we approached our destination, the car turned onto a newly built wide road, lined with neat rows of locust and poplar trees, which the Allied Forces had planted and constructed during their training in their spare time. Soon, we saw a tall gatehouse with a large stone tablet in the center, inscribed with the words "Gate of Revolution" in the handwriting of Commander-in-Chief Hao Pengju.

The rear guard headquarters was located in a large courtyard. The Allied Forces had built a large auditorium here that could accommodate thousands of people. Nearby, there was a hospital training class, headed by Commander-in-Chief Hao's wife, Ms. Liu Qiong, with Deputy Commander Wang's wife as the chief instructor. There were more than ninety students in total, all family members of the Allied Forces. In addition, there was Chen Yi Primary School, a school for the children of the Allied Forces, with nearly a thousand students. The principal said: Commander-in-Chief Hao named the school after Commander Chen Yi to thank him for facilitating the Allied Forces' separation from the reactionary clique and obtaining the great help of the people, as a memorial.

The reporter then went to visit the Allied Forces' Training Regiment. The regiment originally had units such as a cadre brigade, an officers' team, a student team, and a political training class. The students in this team were mostly officers above the rank of battalion commander, and on-the-job cadres were selected for military training on a rotational basis. The curriculum focused on political and ideological education, closely combining the theory and practice of serving the people. Deputy Commander Wang briefly described the purpose of establishing the Training Regiment: Since our Allied Forces launched the uprising, we have been determined to thoroughly transform the troops by standing on the side of the people. To achieve this goal, we must carry out the transformation from the bottom up, so we established the Training Regiment. Commander-in-Chief Hao personally drafted two training orders for this purpose: stipulating that realizing New Democracy and serving the people should be the basic direction, and that building an independent, free, democratic, and prosperous New China should be the goal of the Allied Forces' struggle.

Under this training purpose, the Training Regiment first established a revolutionary political work system—a political instructor was set up in the brigade, and a guidance counselor was set up in the district team, to carry out the transformation of political thought. The Allied Forces headquarters stipulated the abolition of the beating and scolding system. This important task of getting rid of the traditional bad habits of the old army initially encountered some obstacles, but was later successfully overcome. This reform was warmly welcomed by the vast number of soldiers and lower-level cadres.

After the graduates of the Training Regiment returned to their units, they spread what they had learned to the companies. Various units of the Allied Forces organized visiting groups to visit the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army units, gaining great inspiration in improving officer-soldier relations and military-civilian relations. Now, a political work system has been established in various units of the Allied Forces. Soldiers manage their own meals and hold soldiers' congresses, greatly enhancing their enthusiasm and initiative. When soldiers are sick, officers personally take care of them. Each division has a soldiers' theater troupe, which often cooperates with local rural theater troupes to hold military-civilian get-together. The soldiers have learned many songs popular in the liberated areas, such as "March of the Eighth Route Army," "Song of the Democratic Allied Forces," and various Yangko tunes.

After visiting the sports field and the repair shop, the reporter continued to accompany Deputy Commander Wang to the Allied Forces headquarters. Along the way, there were newly built colorful arches in the villages we passed. According to the soldiers accompanying us, these were the remnants of the enthusiastic farewells from the common people when the Allied Forces went to the front line of the self-defense war. In many villages and towns, the masses brought large quantities of tea, cigarettes, and other items. Yangko teams played drums and music everywhere we went. This sincere enthusiasm moved many commanders and fighters to tears.

After arriving at the headquarters, Commander-in-Chief Hao talked about the uprising in a reminiscing tone, saying: "As early as a year before the Japanese surrender, we organized a 革新同志会 (Reform Comrades Association), uniting comrades to strive for the democratic construction of China after the war. Cadres above the regimental level in the Allied Forces all participated in this association because everyone was dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule." Liu Boyang, Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces, said: "Several senior cadres in the Allied Forces were fugitives who had escaped from the reactionary rule of the Chiang government. In order to find a way out in terms of political thought, they contacted the domestic democratic forces before the enemy surrendered. After reading Chairman Mao's "On Coalition Government" and "On New Democracy," they more clearly recognized the hope and future of the Chinese people."

On August 18th of last year, when Commander-in-Chief Hao was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth Route Army, the Allied Forces wanted to launch an uprising, but it failed to materialize because the time was not ripe. Later, they received orders from the Kuomintang authorities to go north to attack the New Fourth Army. On December 31st, when the troops arrived at the Yunhe (Grand Canal) front line, they decided to launch an uprising against the civil war. On January 5th of this year, Commander-in-Chief Hao convened a meeting of cadres above the battalion level to reveal the plan for the uprising. After issuing the uprising telegram on January 9th, they marched to the liberated area on the night of the 10th. Several lower-level cadres of the Allied Forces described that although the night march was extremely exhausting when the Allied Forces arrived in the liberated area, they forgot their fatigue when they saw the New Fourth Army representatives shaking hands with Commander-in-Chief Hao to congratulate him. The colorful banners with slogans such as "Welcome Commander-in-Chief Hao's Glorious Uprising," "Oppose Civil War," and "Oppose Dictatorial Rule" were posted all over the long street, and tens of thousands of common people rushed from hundreds of miles away to welcome them. They excitedly talked about "the Allied Forces quickly changed their appearance not long after entering the liberated area." During the spring plowing, hundreds and thousands of cadres and soldiers went to the fields to push manure and plow the land for the common people; each regiment, battalion, and company lent mules and horses to the local masses for spring plowing; during the summer harvest, they enthusiastically participated in wheat harvesting and transportation. From the day the Allied Forces came to the liberated area, the democratic government and the people had been helping the Allied Forces in every possible way. In terms of grain alone, the collection and transportation of supplies for more than 20,000 people was already heavy, but the masses also enthusiastically and automatically went everywhere to express their condolences and held military-support evening parties, which really moved us very much.

At the headquarters, the reporter personally saw the 74-year-old Speaker of the Senate bringing more than 20 pigs and a batch of items to express condolences to the troops in the scorching sun. When the Allied Forces arrived at the self-defense front line to resist the Chiang army attacking the liberated area, the wave of supporting the army rose like a surging sea. Local Yangko teams and rural theater troupes constantly went to the garrisons of the various divisions and regiments of the Allied Forces to perform and express condolences, and brought a large number of慰劳品 (comfort items). Under the influence of this army-supporting upsurge, the mass discipline of the Allied Forces was further improved, and the phenomenon of desertion was eliminated in the troops. Commander-in-Chief Hao attributed the elimination of corruption, demoralization, disunity, opium smoking, gambling, and other bad habits in the troops to the environment. He said to Commander Chen Yi of the New Fourth Army: "孟母断机杼 (Mencius's mother cutting the loom) is a very correct measure." Commander Chen Yi added: "The environment is important, but the decisive factor lies in Mencius's determination." Indeed, the will and efforts of the people played a driving and guiding role in the transformation of the Allied Forces. The soldiers the reporter met at the self-defense front line all unanimously thanked the masses for their help. One soldier who had been in the army for seven years said: "I have never seen such a good government and common people." There is no doubt that the transformation of the Allied Forces has brought a bright future to the old Chinese army, from an anti-people army to an army of the people.

　　苏鲁民主联军参观记
    七月七日，记者随苏鲁民主联军副总司令王书文将军，专车前往参观联军各部，第一个目的地为后方留守处。将抵目的地时，汽车折入一条新筑的宽阔的公路，两旁整齐地栽着洋槐和杨柳，这是联军在练兵中利用余暇修筑与栽种的。俄顷望见一高大门楼，正中耸立一巨大石碑，上书“革命之门”。郝鹏举总司令手笔。
    留守处所在地为一大院落。联军在此筑有可容千人之大礼堂，邻近设有医院训练班，郝总司令夫人刘琼女士任主任，王副（中缺五字）夫人为主任教官，学员共九十余人，全系联军眷属。此外尚有陈毅小学，为联军子弟学校，学生近千人。校长说：郝总司令为感谢陈毅军长促成联军脱离反动集团，得到人民方面的伟大帮助，故以陈军长之名为其校名以资纪念。
    记者旋往参观联军教导团。该团原设有干部大队、军官队、学员队、政训班等单位。该队学员多为营级以上军官，采取轮训制抽调在职干部军训。课程以政治思想教育为主，以建立为人民服务的理论与实践密切结合。王副总司令扼要叙述成立教导团之目的：我联军自举义以来，决心站在人民立场彻底改造部队，为达此目的，必须自下而上进行改造，乃举办教导团。郝总司令为此手订两个训练要令：规定以实现新民主主义，为人民服务为基本方向，并以建立独立、自由、民主、富强的新中国为联军之奋斗目标。
    在这个训练要旨下，教导团首先建立革命的政工制度，——大队设教导员，区队设指导员，进行政治思想的改造。联军总部规定废止打骂制度，这个摆脱旧军队传统恶习的重要课题开始时，曾遭遇若干阻碍，但后经顺利克服。这一改革受到广大战士与下级干部热烈欢迎。
    教导团毕业学员回到部队后，就将自己所学到的东西传播到连队。联军各部——组织参观团至八路军新四军部队参观，在改进官兵关系与军民关系上得到极大的启发。现联军各部已建立政工制度，战士们自己管理伙食，召开军人大会，工作积极性与自动性大大增强。士兵患病，官长亲自护理。各师均有战士剧团，经常在驻地与农村剧团合作，举行军民联欢大会。战士们学会不少解放区流行的歌曲，如：“八路军进行曲”“民主联军歌”以及各种秧歌小调。
    参观了运动场及修械所之后，记者继随王副总司令驱车赴联军总部。沿途所经村落，都有新建的彩牌，据同行的战士说，这是联军开赴自卫战前线时，老百姓热烈欢送的遗迹。很多村镇的群众，携来茶水、烟卷等大批物品，每过一地秧歌队鼓乐喧天，这种真诚的热情曾使许多指战员感激流泪。
    车抵总部后，郝总司令以回忆的口吻谈起举义的经过说：“早在日寇投降前一年，我们组织了一个革新同志会，团结同志为战后中国民主建设而努力。联军团以上干部都参加这个会，因为人人都不满蒋介石的独裁统治。”联军参谋长刘伯阳说：“联军中有好几个高级干部，都是从蒋政府反动统治下逃出来的亡命者，为求政治思想上的出路，在敌寇投降前他们就与国内的民主力量发生了联系，在看了毛主席的“论联合政府”“新民主主义论”以后，更明确地认清了中国人民的希望和前途。”
    去年八月十八日，郝总司令被编任第六路军总司令时，联军就想举义，但因时机未成熟，未能见诸公开行动。后又接到国民党当局北上进攻新四军的命令，至十二月三十一日部队到达运河前线时，乃决心举行反内战起义。今年一月五日，郝总司令召集营以上干部开会透露起义的计划，一月九日发出举义通电后，十日晚即以夜行军开赴解放区。几个联军下级干部，叙述联军到达解放区时，夜间行军虽使他们极为疲劳，但当他们发现新四军代表在与郝总司令握手道贺，“欢迎郝总司令光荣举义”，“反对内战”“反对独裁统治”的彩色大标语贴满长街，千千万万老百姓从百余里外赶来欢迎时，也就忘记了疲劳。他们兴奋的谈到“进入解放区不久联军迅速地改变了面貌”。春耕时，成百成千的干部和战士，下地为老百姓推粪耕地；各团营连将骡马借给驻地群众春耕；夏收时，又轰轰烈烈地参加割麦与运输。从联军来到解放区当天起，民主政府和人民对联军的帮助真是无微不至。单以粮食来说，二万余人给养的筹集和运输已够繁重，但民众更到处自动热烈慰问，举行劳军晚会，真使我们感动极了。
    在总部，记者亲眼看到七十四岁的老参议长，带着二十多只猪及一批物品冒着烈日前来劳军。当联军开抵自卫前线抗击进攻解放区之蒋军时，劳军热潮如澎湃的海浪一样掀起了，各地秧歌队及农村剧团，不断地到联军各师团驻地演戏劳军，并带来大批慰劳品。在这拥军热潮影响下，联军的群众纪律更加改善，部队中消灭了逃亡现象。郝总司令把部队里消灭了贪污、腐化、不团结、吸大烟、赌博等恶习归功于环境。他对新四军陈毅军长说：“孟母断机杼，是非常正确的措施。”陈毅军长补充说：“环境固然重要，但起决定作用的却在于孟子的决心。”的确人民的意志和努力，对联军的改造起了推动与指导作用。记者在自卫前线遇到的战士，都一致感谢群众的帮助。一位当兵七年的战士说：“我从来没见过这样好的政府和老百姓。”毫无疑问，联军的改造给予中国旧军队，由反人民军队成为人民军队带来了光明的远景。
