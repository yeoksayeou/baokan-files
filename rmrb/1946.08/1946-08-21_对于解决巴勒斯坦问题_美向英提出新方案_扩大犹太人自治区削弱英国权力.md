　　For Resolving the Palestine Issue
　　U.S. Proposes New Plan to Britain
　　Expanding Jewish Autonomous Region and Weakening British Power
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th—According to Reuters and the Associated Press: Truman telegraphed British Prime Minister Attlee on the 15th, urging Britain again to immediately allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine, and proposed a new plan for resolving the Palestine issue. The plan was drafted by Acting Secretary of State Acheson and responsible experts after consultation. Its characteristics are to expand the area and autonomy of the Jewish autonomous region and weaken British power in Palestine. It is reported that the proposed Jewish autonomous region includes the entire northern half of Palestine, except for the western Galilee (area north of the strait) and the Nablus triangle area (north of Jerusalem). In addition, Jewish areas will be delineated in Jerusalem and southern Palestine. (Note: This proposal makes the Jewish area account for half of Palestine, while the original British plan only made the Jewish area account for about a quarter). The plan recommends that Britain should abolish its mandate over Palestine, but maintain military bases there. Truman stated that he would only agree to participate in the Palestine problem conference to be held in London at the end of the month if the above proposal is taken as the basis. According to Reuters, the British government has studied this plan and will publish its attitude towards it in London.

　　扩大犹太人自治区削弱英国权力
    【新华社延安十八日电】据路透社及合众社讯：杜鲁门于十五日照会英首相艾德礼，再次催促英国立即允许十万犹太人移入巴勒斯坦，并提出解决巴勒斯坦问题的新方案。该方案系美代理国务卿亚泽逊与负责专家会商后所拟，其特点为扩大犹太人自治区面积及其自治权力，削弱英国在巴勒斯坦的权力。据悉建议中的犹太人自治区包括除加里西部（海峡以北地区）奈勃罗斯三角地带（耶露撒冷以北）外的整个巴勒斯坦北半部，此外在耶露撒冷及巴勒斯坦南部划出犹太区。（按：此建议使犹太区占巴勒斯坦之半，而英国原来的计划仅使犹太区占约四分之一）。方案建议英国应取消对巴勒斯坦的委任统治权，而保持在该地的军事基地。杜鲁门表示，只有以上述建议为基础，始同意参加月底在伦敦举行的巴勒斯坦问题会议。据路透社称，英政府已研究此一方案，并将在伦敦发表对此方案的态度。
