Xinhua News Agency, August 9th, Handan: The August 2nd incident of Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombing Yan'an has aroused extreme indignation among the military and civilians here. The reporter interviewed General Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, on the morning of August 8th, who issued the following statement: This bombing of Yan'an by American-style Chiang Kai-shek planes is an extremely serious incident. Yan'an is the location of the CCP Central Committee and the CCP Military Headquarters, and it is far from the conflict zones. This signifies Chiang Kai-shek's determination to launch a full-scale civil war. This incident occurred simultaneously with the encirclement and annihilation of our Central Plains Military Region, the attacks on our Shandong and Northern Jiangsu liberated areas, and the attacks on the Jinnan liberated area in this region. This shows that Chiang Kai-shek, standing on Guling, has officially declared war on the people of the whole country who are fighting for independence, peace, and democracy. The military and civilians of our Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region will never tolerate or stand idly by in the face of Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities. I call on the military and civilians of the entire region to rise up in self-defense.

General Liu continued to describe the situation of Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombing the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, stating: Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's planes have been continuously bombing peaceful towns in this region. According to incomplete statistics: Jinan City was bombed on July 30th, Wen County was bombed on August 1st, and various villages and towns in the suburbs of Yongnian were bombed continuously from July 11th to July 30th. The above bombings totaled more than 137 times (each time counted as one plane). In addition, harassment and strafing of Handan, Dongming, Houma, Wenxi, Meng County and other regions have not been included in the statistics. The people have suffered heavy losses, especially in Yongnian. Most of the houses of residents in the suburbs have been damaged, and the people have been displaced and have no means of living. It has been a year since Japan surrendered, but our country has still not achieved independence, democracy, and peace. Any patriotic and humane Chinese person, who would want to plunge the disaster-stricken China back into a colonial status and subject the people who fought in the eight-year war to this unexpected calamity? We issue a serious warning to Chiang Kai-shek, who is selling out the country's independence and relying on American imperialism, and call on the military and civilians of our entire region to immediately rise up, arm themselves for self-defense, and repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, defend Yan'an, and defend the liberated areas. We appeal to the people of the whole country: stop Chiang Kai-shek from using the air force in the civil war and stop Chiang Kai-shek's burning and killing of peaceful residents. General Liu finally pointed out that the reason why Chiang Kai-shek dares to launch a full-scale civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's planes dare to be so rampant is due to American assistance and so-called military aid to China. Chiang Kai-shek's planes, bombs, bullets, and gasoline are entirely supplied by the United States. The American reactionaries have ulterior motives to launch a civil war in China, but they still appear as mediators of the Chinese civil war. In fact, the United States has long lost its qualifications as a third-party mediator, and it is only the instigator and commander of the Chinese civil war. Therefore, we demand that the US government immediately stop military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and call on the American people to rise up and stop the US government's unreasonable interference in China's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: Regarding the incident of Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombing the Yan'an headquarters on the 2nd, Lin Boqu and Li Dingming, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, issued statements to reporters. Chairman Lin Boqu said: "The people of the border region have made great contributions in the eight-year war of resistance, faithfully implemented Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the people live and work in peace and contentment, and are well-fed and clothed. The Kuomintang authorities, while using the banner of the Three Principles of the People, have been constantly harassing and attacking the liberated areas that truly implement the Three Principles of the People. This time, they even bombed the Yan'an headquarters. It is simply lawless! The Yan'an headquarters has lodged a solemn protest with the Kuomintang authorities, and it has been a week, but the Kuomintang authorities are still making unreasonable excuses and trying to shirk their guilt. Our border region people cannot but protest once again, and demand compensation and apologies, and severely punish the masterminds." Chairman Lin pointed out: "The American planes and American bullets were used in this bombing of Yan'an. Therefore, we firmly oppose the current policy of the US government to help the Chinese reactionaries expand the civil war, and demand that the US government stop military aid to Chiang Kai-shek."

Vice-Chairman Li Dingming said: "That day, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed Yan'an, dropping bombs 500 yards near the Wangjiaping headquarters. The people of Yan'an City saw it with their own eyes, but the Kuomintang spokesman still said that 'it did not pass over Yan'an City,' isn't that a lie!? It is clear that they strafed the old people who were weeding in the fields of Yinjiagou and destroyed the crops on the kiln side, but they still argued that 'the bombs were dropped on uninhabited barren mountains,' which is really ridiculous! In short, no matter how they deny it, this event is the prelude to Chiang Kai-shek launching a nationwide civil war." After recounting the facts of the Kuomintang reactionaries relying on the United States to carry out civil war and various humiliating acts of national betrayal, Vice-Chairman Li sighed: "This is the tradition of Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing Dynasty, 'Rather give it to foreign friends than to domestic slaves'!" Vice-Chairman Li said: "What crime have the people of the liberated areas committed? What crime has the Communist Party committed? Why attack them and bomb them? I am non-partisan and non-factional, and I want to say a few honest words from the standpoint of the people: The border region and various liberated areas, due to the implementation of the Three-thirds System, rent reduction and interest reduction, development of production, and various correct policies, have not received any assistance from the Kuomintang authorities in the eight-year war of resistance, but have victoriously resisted the Japanese invaders, and the people's lives are still very good. In recent years, although some areas have suffered natural disasters and difficulties, the Communist Party and the people have worked together to find ways to overcome them. Therefore, no one has starved to death in the border region and various liberated areas. If Chiang Kai-shek wants to continue to attack such a good government, he will inevitably be met with the unanimous resistance of the broad masses of the people."

　　抗议蒋机轰炸延安暴行  
    刘伯承将军发表谈话            
    林主席代表陕甘宁边区人民再度抗议
    【新华社八月九日邯郸电】八月二日蒋机空袭延安事件发生后，引起此间军民极度愤懑，记者为此事特于八月八日上午晋谒晋冀鲁豫军区刘伯承司令员，承发表谈话如次：此次美式蒋机轰炸延安，是一件极其严重的事件，延安是中共中央和中共军总部所在地，它距离冲突地点甚远，这标志着蒋介石发动全面大内战的决心。这事件又与围歼我中原军区进攻我山东及苏北解放区进攻本区之晋南解放区同时，这表明蒋介石站在牯岭之上已向全国独立和平民主奋斗的人民正式宣战了。我晋冀鲁豫军民对蒋介石此种暴行，决难容忍坐视，我号召全区军民起而自卫。
    刘将军继述及蒋机对我晋冀鲁豫边区轰炸的情形称：近日来蒋机不断轰炸本区的和平城镇，据不完全统计：计有七月三十日轰炸济宁市，八月一日炸温县城，七月十一日至三十日连续炸永年城郊各村镇，以上轰炸次数在一百三十七次以上（每次以一架计）。此外对邯郸、东明、侯马、闻喜、孟县等地区骚扰与扫射，均未计算在内，人民损失惨重，尤以永年为最甚，城郊居民房屋大部损坏，人民流离失所，无以为生。日本投降已一周年，我国仍未能实现独立民主与和平，任何爱国的有人性的中国人，谁愿使灾难深重的中国重陷殖民地地位，而使八年抗战的人民受此飞来之横祸。我们特向出卖祖国独立依靠美帝国主义的蒋介石提出严重警告，并号召我全区军民立即起来，武装自卫，击退蒋介石的进攻，保卫延安保卫解放区。我们向全国人民呼吁：制止蒋介石使用空军于内战，停止蒋介石对和平居民的烧杀。刘将军最后指出蒋介石之所以敢于发动全面内战，蒋机敢于如此肆虐，是由于美国的帮助与所谓军事援华，蒋介石的飞机炸弹子弹和汽油完全是美国供应。美国反动派别具野心发动中国内战，但还以调解中国内战的姿态出现，其实美国第三者调解人的资格早已失掉，它只是中国内战的护纵指使者，因此我们要求美政府立即停止军事援蒋，呼吁美国人民起来制止美政府对于中国内政的无理干涉。
    【新华社延安十一日电】对于蒋机二日轰炸延安总部事，陕甘宁边区政府林、李正副主席对记者发表谈话。林主席伯渠称：“边区人民在八年的抗战中，曾有伟大的贡献，忠实实行了中山先生的三民主义，人民安居乐业，衣丰食足，国民党当局打着三民主义的招牌，却对真正实行三民主义的各解放区不断骚扰进攻，这次竟然炸到延安总部来了，真是无法无天！延安总部为此曾向国民党当局提出严正抗议，迄今已一周，国民党当局还要无理狡辩，企图卸罪。我们边区人民不能不再一次提出抗议，并要求赔偿道歉，严厉惩办主谋者。”林主席指出：“这次轰炸延安用的是美国飞机，美国枪弹，因此我们对美国政府帮助中国反动派扩大内战的现行政策坚决反对，要求美国政府停止对蒋介石的军事援助。”
    李副主席鼎铭称：“那天蒋介石飞机轰炸延安，投炸在王家坪总部附近五百码处，延市人民众目所睹，但国民党发言人还说‘没有经过延安市上空’，岂非撒谎！？明明扫射了正在尹家沟地里锄草的老百姓，毁灭了窑畔上的庄稼，还狡辩说‘炸弹投在无人烟的荒山’，实在可笑！总之，不管怎样抵赖，这件事是蒋介石发动全国规模内战的先声。”李副主席历述国民党反动派依靠美国进行内战及各种丧权辱国的事实之后，叹息道：“这就是满清末年慈禧太后‘宁赠友邦勿予家奴”的传统！”李副主席说：“解放区人民何罪？共产党何罪？为什么要进攻他们，轰炸他们？我是无党无派的，我想站在人民立场讲几句老实话：边区及各解放区由于执行了三三制、减租减息、发展生产及各种正确政策，在八年抗战中没有得到国民党当局的任何接济，但却胜利的抵御了日寇的进攻，人民生活还过得很好。几年来部分地区虽遭受天灾和困难，但共产党与人民一起共谋办法，把它战胜了，故在边区及各解放区没有人饿死，像这样的好政府，如果蒋介石再要继续进攻，则必然遭到广大人民一致抵抗。”
