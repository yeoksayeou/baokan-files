　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, August 11th: Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops launched a large-scale offensive against Jiangsu and Anhui, Chiang Kai-shek's planes, taking advantage of the river's high water level, have continuously bombed and destroyed the dikes of the Yun and Shu Rivers within the Jiangsu and Anhui liberated areas. On the 29th of last month, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed the Shu River dike in Xin'an Town. On the same day, Chiang Kai-shek's planes dropped several bombs on the Yun dike outside Gaoyou. On the 30th, several bombs were dropped on the Yun dike at Wangjiatun, nine miles north of Gaoyou City, one of which landed directly on the top of the dike, damaging a section. Wangying and other places along the canal north of Gaoyou were repeatedly strafed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, hindering and damaging the summer flood prevention projects. As early as the beginning of June, the Kuomintang authorities in Yangzhou had illegally blocked the Lanjiang dams, which divert floodwaters from the canal into the Yangtze River, causing floods in Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua and other counties. The Border Region Provisional Assembly telegraphed Mr. Song Ziwen, requesting him to forward the message to the Kuomintang Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to open the dams, but received no reply. Recently, the Air Force has continued the destruction. At the same time, the Kuomintang propaganda machine has continuously spread rumors such as "Communist troops are destroying the dikes of the Yun and Shu Rivers in northern Jiangsu" and "Communist troops are destroying the Hongze Lake dam." People here believe that this is a vicious conspiracy by the Kuomintang reactionaries to flood the 21 million people in northern Jiangsu to assist their insufficient military offensive and at the same time shift the blame onto others. In response to this, in addition to expressing strong protests, various places are establishing dike protection organizations to assist in the smooth progress of summer flood prevention projects.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, August 31st: The Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government has recently allocated 19 million Central China currency (equivalent to 120 million legal tender) to repair the middle and southern sections of the Yun River's summer flood prevention project in order to protect the lives and property of millions of people along the river. The project is now underway in various sections.

　  配合军事进攻企图水淹苏北            
    蒋机狂炸运沭河堤     
    苏皖政府拨巨款修建运河夏防
    【新华社淮阴十一日电】蒋军大举进攻苏皖以来，蒋机乘河水伏泛之危，对苏皖解放区境内运、沭各河堤岸，作连续性的轰炸破坏。上月二十九日蒋机炸新安镇之沭河堤岸，同日蒋机在高邮×外运堤上投弹数枚。三十日又在高邮城北九里之王家屯向运堤投弹数枚，一弹正落堤顶被炸坏一处。高邮以北沿运河之水界首王营等地，连遭蒋机扫射，使夏防工程受到阻挠与毁坏。早在六月初旬，扬州国民党当局即曾违例堵塞运河涨水入江之拦江各坝，致使高邮、宝应、兴化等县遭受水患。边区临参会曾电请宋子文氏转致国民党江北运河工程局启坝，迄未答复，近复继以空军破坏。于此同时，国民党宣传机关却连续散播“共军在苏北破坏运、沭两河堤”“共军破坏洪泽湖大堤”等谣言。此间人士认为此乃国民党反动派企图以水淹苏北二千一百万人民，以辅助军事进攻之不足而同时嫁祸于人之恶毒阴谋。对此，除表示严重抗议外，各地正成立护堤组织，协助夏防工程之顺利进行。
    【新华社淮阴三十一日电】苏皖边区政府，顷拨出华中币一千九百万元（合法币一万万二千余万元），修建运河南中两段夏防工程，以保障沿河数百万人民生命财产之安全。现该工程已在各段着手进行中。
