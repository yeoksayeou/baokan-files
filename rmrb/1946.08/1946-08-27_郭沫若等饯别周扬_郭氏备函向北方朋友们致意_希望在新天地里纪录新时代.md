　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th. Shanghai Report: Cultural figures in Shanghai, including Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Tian Han, totaling more than forty individuals, held a grand farewell gathering on the 14th of this month for Zhou Yang, the former president of Yan'an University and a writer, as he returned to Zhangjiakou in the North. Zhou reported on his experience of being denied a passport after being invited to visit the United States, expressing gratitude for the concern of his Shanghai cultural colleagues and appealing to them to strengthen ties with the liberated areas, as well as provide assistance and guidance. Professors Wu Han, Shang Yue, and Chu Tunan from Southwest Associated University, who had recently arrived in Shanghai from Kunming, were invited to speak. Wu Han pointed out that the government's refusal to issue passports was within his expectations, but this alone was sufficient to prove who was undermining the Four Pledges and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Wu and others elaborated on the assassinations of Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu, stating that Wen's family was now suffering all kinds of persecution from Kuomintang secret agents, and had fallen into a state where they could neither live nor die. His words were filled with grief and indignation, moving the entire audience. During the gathering, participants wrote inscriptions for Zhou Yang as farewell gifts. Guo Moruo wrote: "Arriving in Shanghai is, in fact, equivalent to arriving in the United States. There is no need to travel across the ocean. It is essential to bury oneself in hard work. I believe that our separation this time (missing number) will bring enthusiasm to our friends in the North." Xu Guangping wrote: "Bring the light from afar to our side." Tian Han also improvised a poem for Zhou Yang: "The east wind refuses to favor Zhou Lang, so take advantage of the south wind to return to the north. Why gild gold to make it shine? Vow to shine for democracy." Hu Feng's poem was: "No gifts, just take our memories and expectations back to the North! China is now divided into two worlds, the visible and the invisible. In the invisible world, we must cross the butcher's knife and tread through thorns to complete this road, until the day we cheer and reunite under the free sunshine." A famous playwright wrote: "He does not allow people to go to the United States because he is afraid that people will know he is a executioner. He is pitiful and not far from death. Let him die before you go." He signed it: "On the day of issuing a statement to the executioner." The gathering lasted until 11 o'clock in the evening, ending in joy, with participants expressing their best wishes upon departure.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th. Shanghai Report: Guo Moruo, a leader in Chinese cultural circles, specially prepared a letter on the eve of Zhou Yang's departure from Shanghai to return to the North (the 14th), entrusting Zhou to bring it back to express his greetings to friends in the North. The full text of the letter is as follows:

　　I spent a whole day reading the first collection of "Short Stories from the Liberated Areas" and Zhao Shuli's "Li Youcai's Rhymes" in one breath. This is one of the greatest joys of my life! I have never particularly liked reading novels, but this time is an exception. Such a new era, a new world, a new century of creation. Such moving deeds and facts are surely abundant in the liberated areas. I hope that friends with pens in hand will do their best to record them. Even if they are just raw materials, they are already masterpieces. When they are compiled into a huge work in the future, it will be an epoch-making great work. I hate that I am trapped in another world, too far from the light, but I hope that those who live in the light will not forget to distribute the light to all directions.

　　Brother Zhou Yang will return to the bright homeland tomorrow. He asked me to write down my impressions after reading the above two books. This is a rough draft. My respectful greetings to the people from the friends in the North!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Guo Moruo

　　郭沫若等饯别周扬
    郭氏备函向北方朋友们致意
    希望在新天地里纪录新时代
    【新华社延安二十四日电】沪讯：此间文化界人士郭沫若、茅盾、田汉等四十余人，于本月十四日为前延安大学校长文学家周扬北返张家口，举行盛会饯别，周氏即席报告遭拒发护照应邀访美经过，对沪文化界同仁之关怀表示谢意，并吁请沪文化界朋友加强与解放区联系，并予帮助及指导。新从昆明抵沪之西南联大吴晗、尚钺、楚图南诸教授被邀讲话，吴晗氏指出政府拒发护照，乃在他意料中，但由此已足资证明谁在破坏四项诺言和政协决议。吴氏等阐述闻、李被暗杀事件，并谓闻氏家属现正遭受国民党特务种种迫害，已陷入求生不能求死不得之境，言下不胜悲愤，全场为之动容。席间与会者纷纷为周扬题词赠别。郭沫若写道：“到了上海，事实上就等于到了美国，不必远涉重洋了，还是自己埋头苦干的要紧。我相信我们这一次的分别（中缺数字），热心带给北方的朋友。”许广平写道：“远方的光芒带来到近旁。”田汉并即席为周扬题诗：“东风不肯便周郎，即趁南风返朔方，何必镀金方灿烂，誓为民主放光芒。”胡风题诗是：“没有礼物，把我们的怀念和期待带回北方去吧！中国已分幽明二界，在幽界中的我们，总要穿过屠刀踏过荆棘，走完这条路，直到我们在自由的阳光下面欢呼重见的一天。”某名剧作家题道：“他不许人到美国去，他怕人知道他是刽子手；他可怜得很，他离死不远了，等他死了再去吧。”下书：“于刽子手发表文告之日。”聚会至晚间十一时始尽欢而散，临别犹殷殷致意。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】沪讯：中国文化界领袖郭沫若氏于周扬离沪北返前夕（十四日），特备函件托周氏带回，向北方的朋友们致意，该函全文如下：
    我费了一天工夫，一口气把《解放区短篇创作选》第一辑和赵树理的《李有才板话》读了一遍，这是我生平的一大快事！我从不大喜欢读小说，这一次是破例，这样一个新的时代，新的天地，新的创作世纪。这样可歌可泣的事实，在解放区必然很丰富，我希望有笔在手的朋友们，尽力把它们纪录下来，即使是素材，已经就是杰作。将来集结成巨制时，便是划时代的伟大作品。我恨我自己陷在另一个天地里，和光明离的太远，但愿在光明中生活的人，不要忘记应该把光明分布到四方。
    周扬兄明天便要回光明的乡土去了，他要我把对于上列二书读后的印象写出，草草就此，向北方的朋友们致人民的敬礼！
                              郭沫若
