　　Magnetic County Mass Movement Experience
    Ci County Joint Office
    Magnetic County has gained a lot of experience in the mass movement of the past six months. It is introduced below for reference by various regions.
    I. The Direction of the Movement

    The main characteristics of the new district are that feudal landlords, combined with remnants of enemy puppets, cruelly rule and exploit the masses. Therefore, anti-traitorism and rent reduction are equally urgent demands of the masses. However, experience has proven that starting with rent reduction often fails to mobilize the broad masses. Starting with anti-traitorism and combining it with rent reduction and wage increases mobilizes the most widely, the fastest, and the most powerfully. It can strike at the main leaders of traitors, local bullies, and landlords at once, and also makes it easy to thoroughly carry out the rent reduction movement. However, three points need to be grasped: First, the target of struggle should preferably be the main figures who combine traitorism, bullying, and feudal landlordism to rule a village or several villages. Second, win over the running dogs to expand and organize the mass camp; but this must be combined with striking at the landlords; isolated efforts are ineffective. Third, always pay attention to cultivating poor and hired peasant backbones. A major lesson is that many villages were seized by hooligans, running dogs, or puppet personnel who strangled the movement because of the lack of such backbones.
    II. Leadership Support, Mass Support, and Joint Struggle

    Leading cadres should boldly support the demands of the masses and encourage them to rise up and struggle; at the same time, advanced masses help backward masses, and advanced villages help backward villages. In particular, the assistance of armed militia often plays a significant role. This is mass support. Many backward villages have launched struggles in this way.
    Based on the peasants' class integrity—the ideological awareness that "all peasants under heaven are one family"—and the understanding that "unity is strength," they automatically collude and jointly organize several villages or even the entire district to struggle against a common target in a certain village. The struggle method is often very intense. We should not be afraid or restrict it, but should actively lead and help, because this method can quickly make the masses realize their own strength and strengthen their fighting spirit and confidence in victory. At the same time, it is a powerful suppression of the sabotage activities of landlords and special agents. The landlord in Beilai Village had already prepared a riot, but it was stopped by the news of the joint struggle of the entire district against ×××. However, this kind of joint struggle should rely on the masses' voluntary and automatic collusion, and should not be monopolized or ordered by the masses to unite.
    III. Arming Up and Overcoming the "Change of Sky" Mentality

    From secret collusion and complaining to arming oneself and then to open struggle action is the process of the Magnetic County peasants' awakening, and arming oneself is an important key. Due to the black gun threats of traitors, special agents, bullies, and landlords, and being close to the ruling areas of the Jiang puppet army, the masses generally demanded to confiscate the landlords' weapons and arm themselves after secret collusion and complaining. The leadership resolutely helped the masses realize this demand, which greatly enhanced the masses' fighting spirit and promoted the development of the movement from secret to open, overcoming the "change of sky" mentality of fearing the return of the Jiang puppet army and fearing black guns, which once existed seriously.
    The mass armed forces do not necessarily have to be called militia at the beginning, because the masses are not used to it or have misunderstandings. As long as the masses voluntarily take up weapons to defend themselves, and after several organized actions, they gradually become militia, and they are very consolidated.
    IV. Activists and Leading Backbone

    The movement can only move forward rapidly, and the leadership can only let go, if there is a group of activists who truly serve the people and leading backbones generated from the masses. When we first arrive in an area to work, those who are most likely to approach us are mostly fugitive soldiers, veterans, or people who have some relationship with us during the Anti-Japanese War. These people do not necessarily have connections with the masses, and some have hooliganism and are slippery. Their work is mostly an official attitude. These need to be transformed in the mass movement. The leadership is determined to go deep into the masses to discover and cultivate backbones who truly connect with the masses. General experience has proven that the activists who are the most oppressed, poor, hardworking, and dare to speak and act, discovered in complaining, are the best activists and can be quickly cultivated into leading backbones.
    V. Ideological Leadership and Internal Problems of Peasants

    Ideological leadership can generally be divided into two issues: mobilizing the masses to rise up and struggle, and grasping the ideological situation and conducting education at any time during the action. Experience has proven that it is necessary to understand the most specific pains and sorrows (regardless of big or small) of each mass in deep contact with the masses, accurately grasp the motivation and stimulation, and guide them to complain, settle accounts, and find the root of poverty, in order to make the masses distinguish class boundaries and resolutely rise up to struggle. Only the arousal of "anger" can truly make the masses fight regardless of life and death. At this point, the "change of sky" mentality is completely resolved.
    After the movement rises, pay attention to anti-internal traitors and the swaying of individual cadres, so that they do not affect the entire camp. The Second District held a large-scale meeting of activists, launched the anti-Zhu Weixin struggle, exposed his crimes of accepting bribes and letting go of the bully landlord Wang Hongxun, and launched the "Zhu Weixin Thought" inspection movement, which played a major role in consolidating the camp.
    After the climax of the movement, it is necessary to prevent the landlords from counterattacking and internal disputes. The Second District proposed "Everyone joins hands, villages jointly defend, dig out all rotten meat, and eliminate bad seeds" to prevent counterattacks. During the deep movement, it proposed "Three no remainings" (one does not leave a person suffering, two does not leave a problem, three does not leave a backward mass), which all played a role in consolidating the peasant camp.
    The internal problems of peasants are mainly the unity of middle and poor peasants and the distribution of the fruits of struggle.
    At the beginning of the Ci County mass movement, poor peasants and hired peasants first joined the peasant association, without middle peasants, thinking that they had a relationship with the landlords, so they only absorbed middle peasants to participate in the movement during large movements, but were unwilling to absorb them to participate in the peasant association. In some areas, middle peasants joined the peasant association, but poor and hired peasants held their own secret peasant associations, and they were still not united. This has created an unfavorable situation where landlords win over middle peasants and counterattack poor peasants. Generally, middle peasants dare not rely on landlords and rich peasants (fear of struggle), and they also cannot rely on the peasant association, feeling distressed. Each district has accumulated some experience in solving this problem. In summary, it is to improve the peasants' class integrity and the awareness of the consistency of interests, so that poor peasants realize that their fate is the same as that of middle peasants, and the truth that they cannot win without uniting middle peasants. Then, "dig out the heart disease" and "untie the knot" for the middle peasants, tell them that middle peasants are also basic masses, explain our policy of never infringing on the interests of middle peasants, and appropriately give benefits. Absorbing them to participate in the struggle, participate in the peasant association, and select resolute elements to participate in leadership and become cadres are all effective methods.
    The issue of distributing the fruits of struggle should grasp the principles of "democracy and speed." As long as it is discussed by the masses and everyone's opinions are generally consistent, it can be distributed immediately, without being too particular about "scientific" methods: such as detailed grading, etc., the masses are not used to it, and it is not rewarding. The Second District first generally discussed it with cadres and activists, then decided by the masses, and immediately distributed it, generally grasping the principle of "masses first, cadres later," and proposed four essentials (to be fast, to be thorough, to be democratic, and to be fair); corrected the phenomenon of misusing the fruits and treating the fruits as foreign wealth. When the Third District distributed, it proposed "comparing merits," recognizing that the victory of the struggle was the merit of the masses, not the merit of a certain person, but attention should be paid to taking care of the militia and anti-family members, and inspiring the masses to automatically care for them.
    VI. Raiding Backward Villages

    Most of the backward villages after the climax of the movement are feudal bully or special agent fortresses. The rulers have counter-revolutionary experience, use running dogs and hooligans, or buy off activists who originally had relations with us, and implement the "security leader policy": using our organizational forms, they place the leaders they control in each department, such as the chairman of the peasant association. The rulers implement false enlightenment, "support" the land to some poor people, buy people's hearts, and suppress the struggle; or struggle against one or two bad people who are not in harmony with them, so that the masses gain some benefits, and then promote "there is no problem in our village anymore." Some incite middle peasants and poor peasants to struggle indiscriminately, actually to divert attention and suppress the peasants. In addition, some villages simply do not move. To open up the situation in these villages, the only key is to destroy the ruling group's "security leader policy." Implement mass review and cleaning, remove bad elements, clear obstacles to the movement, and organize the masses to struggle against the rulers.
    When opening up, it is necessary to use the masses of advanced villages to support, and some need to use armed cover to ensure the safety of working comrades and the masses who have just emerged. At any time, expose the rulers' conspiracies to isolate cadres from the masses, incite mutual struggles between the masses of this village and other villages, and spread rumors and threats to the masses, so that the masses of this village, the masses of other villages, and the leading cadres can be combined into a three-in-one whole, so that the situation can be opened up smoothly.

　　磁县群运经验
    磁县联合办公室
    磁县在最近半年的群众运动中，取得不少经验。特介绍于下，供各地参考。
    一、运动的方向问题
    新区主要特点是封建地主结合敌伪残余，残酷的统治压榨群众，所以反奸与减租同样是群众的迫切要求。但经验证明，先搞减租多半发动不了广大群众；先搞反奸并与减租增资结合进行，发动的最广泛，最快，最有力量，能一下打击到汉奸恶霸地主身上，也容易使减租运动搞得彻底。但需要掌握三点：第一、斗争对象，最好选择汉奸、恶霸与封建地主结合一体统治一村或数村的主要头子。第二、争取走狗，扩大与整齐群众阵营；但必须与打击地主结合；孤立争取则无效。第三、时刻注意培养贫雇农骨干，好些村因无此骨干而被流氓、走狗或伪人员窃取了领导，绞杀了运动，是一个很大的教训。
    二、领导上的支援、群众的支援、联合斗争
    领导干部要大胆支持群众的要求，鼓舞群众起来斗争；同时，先进群众帮助落后群众，先进村帮助落后村，特别是武装民兵的帮助，也经常起着很大作用，这就是群众的支援。许多落后村曾这样掀起斗争。
    基于农民的阶级整体性——“天下农民是一家”的思想觉悟，以及“联合起来力量大”的认识，他们自动串通，自动联合若干村以至全区到某一村去斗争一个共同的对象时，斗争方式时常是很剧烈的，我们不应该害怕或限制，而应该积极去领导、帮助，因为这种方式能使群众很快认识自身力量，坚定斗志与胜利信心。同时也是对地主特务们的破坏活动，有力的镇压。北来村地主已经准备好了的暴动，是被全区群众对×××联合斗争的消息吓得停止了的。但这种联合斗争，应该依靠群众的自愿与自动串通，不能包办或命令群众联合。
    三、武装起来与变天思想的克服
    由秘密串通、诉苦到武装自己、再到公开斗争行动，是磁县农民觉悟的过程，而武装自己是一个重要的关键。由于汉奸特务恶霸地主们的黑枪威胁与靠近蒋伪军统治区，群众在秘密串通诉苦后，一般都要求收缴地主武器，武装自己。领导上坚决帮助群众实现了这一要求，曾大大增强了群众斗志，推动了运动由秘密到公开的发展，克服了曾经严重存在的怕蒋伪军再来与怕黑枪的变天思想。
    群众武装，一开始不一定叫民兵，因为群众不习惯，或有误解。只要群众自愿的拿起武器保卫自己，并经过几次有组织的行动，逐渐都变成了民兵，而且很巩固。
    四、积极分子与领导骨干
    必须有一批真正为人民服务的积极分子与群众中产生的领导骨干，运动才能迅速前进，领导上也才能放得开手。我们初到一个地区工作时，首先容易与我们接近的，多是逃亡战士，退伍军人，或与我们在抗战时期有点关系的人，这些人不一定与群众有联系，有些有流氓性，滑头，工作多是办公事态度，这些需在群运中加以改造，领导上决心深入群众，发现与培养真正联系群众的骨干。一般经验证明：在诉苦中发现的最受压迫、贫苦勤劳、敢说敢干的积极分子，是最好的积极分子，可以很快培养成领导骨干。
    五、思想领导与农民内部问题
    思想领导，一般可分为鼓动群众起来斗争，和在行动中掌握思想情况并随时进行教育等两个问题。经验证明，必须在与群众深刻的接触中了解各个群众最具体的痛苦与伤心事（不管大事小事），抓准进行鼓动激发，引导其诉苦、算账、找穷根，才能使群众分清阶级界线，坚决起来斗争。也只有“愤火”的激起，才能真正使群众不顾生死去斗争。到了这步田地，变天思想也就彻底解决了。
    运动起来以后，要注意反内奸与个别干部的摇摆，使其不影致响整个阵营。二区召开大规模的积极分子会议，展开反朱维新斗争，揭发其受贿放跑恶霸地主王鸿勋的罪恶，并展开“朱维新思想”检查运动，曾在巩固阵营上起了很大作用。
    运动高潮过后，要防止地主反攻与内部纠纷。二区为防止反攻而提出“人人联手，村村联防、挖尽烂肉，肃清坏种”，深入运动时提出“三不留”（一不留一个受痛苦的人，二不留一个问题，三不留一个落后群众），这些都曾起了巩固农民阵营的作用。
    农民内部问题，主要是中贫农团结与分配斗争果实两个问题。
    磁县群运开始，贫农与雇农先参加了农会，不要中农，认为他们和地主有关系，所以只在大运动时吸收中农参加运动，而不肯吸收参加农会。有些地区中农参加了农会，但贫雇农另外自己召开秘密农会，还是团结不好。曾造成地主拉拢中农、反攻贫农的不利形势，一般中农不敢靠地主富农（怕斗），同样靠不上农会，感到苦闷。各区在解决这问题上，一般都积累了一些经验。概括说来，则是提高农民阶级整体性，利害一致性的自觉，使贫农认识自己与中农的命运是相同的，以及不团结中农不能胜利的道理。然后给中农“挖心病”，“解疙瘩”，告诉他们中农也是基本群众，解释我们决不侵犯中农利益的政策，并适当给予利益。吸收其参加斗争，参加农会，选其中坚决分子参加领导，当干部，都是有效办法。
    分配斗争果实问题，要掌握“民主、迅速”的原则，只要经过群众讨论，大家意见大体一致，就可以马上分，不必过于讲究“科学的”办法：如详细的分等分级等，群众也不习惯，出力不讨好。二区是先经干部积极分子大体讨论好，再经群众决定，马上就分，一般掌握了“先群众、后干部”的原则，并提出了四要（要快、要尽，要民主，要公平）；纠正了乱用果实，把果实当外财的现象。三区分配时，提出“比功劳”，认识斗争胜利是群众的功劳，不是某个人的功劳，但应注意照顾民兵与抗属，启发群众自动爱护他们。
    六、突击落后村
    运动高潮过后的落后村，大部是封建恶霸或特务堡垒，统治者有反革命经验，利用走狗、流氓或收买原来与我们有关系的积极分子，实行了“安头政策”：利用我们的组织形式，每部门都安置了他们掌握的头目，如农会主席等。统治者实行假开明，“拥护”土地给部分穷人，收买人心，抑制斗争；或斗争一两个与他们不睦的坏人，使群众获得一点利益，即宣传“我村再没问题了”。有的是鼓动中农贫农乱斗争，实际是转移视线、镇压农民。另外有些村，则干脆一动不动，要想打开这些村的局面，唯一关键是摧毁统治集团的安头政策。实行群众性的审查清洗，去掉坏分子，扫除运动障碍，组织群众向统治者斗争。
    开辟时要用先进村群众去支援，有的要用武装掩护，使工作同志与刚抬头的群众获得安全。随时揭发统治者隔绝干部与群众，挑拨本村与外村群众互斗，以及对群众造谣威胁等阴谋，使本村群众、外村群众、领导干部能三位一体结合起来，才能顺利打开局面。
