Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shanxi, 21st—Datong City is an important military base for Yan Xishan and the remnants of Japanese invading forces to jointly attack the liberated areas of Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Sui. After Yan's troops under Chu Xichun and the traitor Wang Zhenfan entered Datong in August of last year, all Japanese troops were retained and promoted by three ranks based on their original officer ranks, receiving salaries equivalent to second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain, and major. Recently, the "Artillery Officer Training" and "Infantry Officer Training" classes run by Yan's army in Datong are staffed by these Japanese personnel as instructors. According to incomplete statistics, there are as many as 27 reorganized puppet troops and puppet police forces from various places in Northern Yanmen, including those led by An Qin, Fang Xinqian, and Li Mengshu. These were combined to form the Fifth Army of the Shanxi Provincial Defense Army (Commander and concurrently Datong Garrison Commander, Han Buzhou, with the 13th, 14th, and 15th Divisions under his command). Later, to conceal their actions from the world, the army was reorganized into the Provisional 38th Division, under the command of Zhao Chengshou's 31st Army. The Yan's puppet troops in the area once invaded and occupied over a hundred important towns in the liberated areas, including Fengzhen, Zuoyun, Gushan, Yungang, and Emao. The 15th Division of the Fifth Army of the Provincial Defense Army (reorganized from puppet troops who were formerly puppet police chiefs) committed bloody incidents such as the massacre in Zuoyun on January 15, the Huayuantun incident in Datong on February 25, and the attack on Xiaoxiji in western Datong on June 8, successively slaughtering over a hundred local masses and cadres. On July 24th, more than 2,000 Yan's puppet infantry and cavalry from Datong attacked Sanlipu in the direction of Yanggao. Special agent organizations are everywhere in the city. According to investigations, these include the Resources Investigation Society, Yanbei Office, Datong "Leading Group," "Investigation and Statistics Office," the Second Working Group of the Second War Zone Headquarters, the Comrades Association, the Jinbei Party Affairs Office of the Kuomintang, the Jinbei Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the "Assassination Squad." The Resources Investigation Society was originally a Japanese intelligence agency, later taken over by Yan Xishan with the original staff, led by Japanese intelligence chief Major General Nakahara. The head of the "Assassination Squad" is a Japanese named Kouki Fukui. The squad was established in May of this year and has thirteen "Assassination Groups," each ranging from six to thirty people, carrying out sabotage activities such as assassinations and robberies in the liberated areas of the Northern Section of the Tongpu Railway.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th—Beijing News: The 14th Division of the 16th Army stationed in Changxindian and the 22nd Division stationed in Nankou of Chiang's army were transferred without authorization in early June, and part of them participated in the attack on Panggezhuang and Anci areas north of the Yongding River in the Hebei-Central Hebei Liberated Area. At the joint staff meeting of the Executive Headquarters on the 8th, all three parties unanimously agreed that this violated Order No. 4 and that all persons in charge of the two divisions should be formally reprimanded.

This newspaper, Yangcheng, 20th—At 11:00 on the 19th, Chiang's troops entrenched in Wenxi, Southern Shanxi, attacked from Dongzhen in three routes, capturing Houma, the commercial center of Southern Shanxi and the intersection of the Tongpu Railway and the Qu(wo)-Xin(jiang) Highway. Two regiments of Yan's 72nd Division stationed in Xinjiang also launched attacks on the same day in coordination. Houma was an important town liberated by our Taiyue Eighth Route Army from the traitor Wang Wanshun before the ceasefire. Our army has now maneuvered to both sides of the Tongpu Railway, and a major battle is about to begin.

This newspaper, Handan, 19th—Following the anti-civil war uprising of the first and third companies of the first battalion of the 530th Regiment of the 117th Brigade of the Nationalist 38th Division in Huixian County on the 8th of this month, at dawn on the 16th, a platoon of the 529th Regiment of the same brigade stationed in Gaozhuang, Huixian County, led by the platoon leader, carried two light machine guns and two grenade launchers and staged an anti-civil war uprising, joining the people's side. The platoon has now safely arrived in the liberated area and has been warmly welcomed by the people everywhere.
