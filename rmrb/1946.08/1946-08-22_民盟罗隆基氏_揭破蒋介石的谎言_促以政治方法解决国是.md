Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th—Chiang Kai-shek's proclamations, like those he has issued in the past, contain fine wording; however, some parts of the proclamations do not align with the facts. Luo Longji, head of the Propaganda Committee of the China Democratic League, when meeting with reporters on the 15th, first listed the recent banning of 120 magazines in Rongkun by the National Government. He then made the following remarks on Chiang Kai-shek's proclamation, namely that Chiang Kai-shek was lying when he said that "wartime laws restricting the people's freedom have been repealed or amended." Luo then went on to denounce the six guidelines in Chiang's proclamation, the first three of which completely violate the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). He said: "First, the National Assembly is scheduled to be convened in November of this year. This date was decided by the government itself without consultation with the PCC and various parties; second, to gather opinions from all sides for the National Assembly's reference in drafting the constitution. This means the government will draft the constitution on its own, overturning the resolutions of the PCC; third, to broaden the foundation of the government and invite various parties and non-partisans to participate. This means the government will invite parties on its own canceling the resolutions of the PCC." Regarding Chiang Kai-shek's proclamation that the CCP should abandon its armed forces, Luo stated that the Democratic League is now a political party that adheres to the constitution and seeks peaceful and legal means. However, the Democratic League has not received legitimate and equal treatment. Leaders of the Democratic League have been kidnapped in Beiping and assassinated in Kunming. With these facts existing, how can a political party with armed forces dare to lay down its arms? Finally, Luo believed that the Kuomintang government "should immediately and thoroughly stop the civil war, act conscientiously, and genuinely solve national affairs through political means."

　  揭破蒋介石的谎言
　  促以政治方法解决国是
    【新华社南京十九日电】蒋介石之文告，有如彼已往所发表之文告文章虽好，惟文告若干处与事实不符。民主同盟宣传委员会主委罗隆基氏于十五日接见记者时，首先列举最近蓉昆有百二十种杂志被国民政府查禁，对蒋介石文告作如下表示，即蒋介石在文告中是谎言“战时限制人民自由之法令已撤销或修改”了的。罗氏继指责蒋文告中之六项方针，其前三项均完全违反政协决议。他说：“第一为今年十一月如期召开国大，此日期系政府自行决定，而未经政协及各党派协商；第二项为荟萃各方意见供国大参考，制成宪法，此即系政府将自行制出宪草而推翻政协决议；第三项为扩大政府基础，邀请各党派无党派参加，即政府自行邀请而取消政协决议。”罗氏对蒋介石文告要中共放弃武力，表示民盟现为一遵循宪法和平合法之政党，但民盟未得合法平等之待遇，民盟领导人在北平被绑架，在昆明被暗杀，在此事实存在之下，有武力政党如何敢放下武力？最后罗氏认为国民党政府“应即彻底停止内战，出于良心，真正以政治方法解决国是问题”。
