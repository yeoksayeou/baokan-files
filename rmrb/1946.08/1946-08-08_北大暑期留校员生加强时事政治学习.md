　　Peking University Summer留校员 Students Strengthen Current Affairs and Political Studies
　　[News from Xingtai by our newspaper] Since Mr. Fan Wenlan, the president of Northern University, arrived at the school, and after classifying students by their level, implementing class assignments by department, and formally starting classes, the two months of education from May to July have yielded remarkable results from all aspects. The main manifestations are the rapid improvement of students' cultural level and the significant progress in theoretical understanding. Almost everyone's outlook has been renewed.
　　Recently, most of the school's faculty, staff, and students, except for a portion who voluntarily participated in land reform teams to go to the countryside to help mobilize the masses, and those who took leave to return to their hometowns to visit relatives and retrieve belongings, are conducting summer remedial education. At a time when the situation is tense, and the Kuomintang fascists and the dictator Chiang Kai-shek are colluding with American imperialism, selling out the country, and launching a large-scale civil war, the school authorities discovered a tendency among students to emphasize culture and neglect the study of current affairs and politics. Therefore, the school's Secretary-General Luo Qing, Dean of Academic Affairs Wang Zhenhua, Deputy Director of Academic Affairs Guo Qianheng, Deputy Director of the School of Engineering Liu Danian, and the head teacher of the attached classes, Zhang Jinan, and four other teachers formed a five-person committee to rectify and promote summer learning. On July 23rd, a meeting of faculty and staff cadres was held to discuss this matter. At the meeting, the faculty and staff spoke enthusiastically. Mr. Yin Da, the deputy director of the library and a historian and archaeologist, pointed out that the continuous assassinations of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo by Chiang's fascists are a bloody suppression by the Jiang-US reactionaries against the Chinese people, coordinating with their signal to launch a large-scale civil war against the liberated areas nationwide. This bloody fact proves that we cannot calmly bury ourselves in long-term academic research. If there is no independent, peaceful, and democratic China, who will academic research serve in the future? In order to defend the liberated areas and aid the peace and democracy movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and to make everyone vigilant about the current situation, prepare and take action to resolutely respond to and support the call of President Fan and the five-person committee, he advocated immediately launching school-wide current affairs education and strengthening combat-oriented life. Mr. Yin Da's speech immediately aroused enthusiastic approval from the audience, especially from scholars Wang Jindi and Guan Taili, who had just arrived from Beiping. On the spot, they discussed and passed several resolutions on summer teaching and life rectification. (Kang Zhi)

　　北大暑期留校员生加强时事政治学习
    【本报邢台讯】北方大学，自校长范文澜先生到校，经过分别学生程度、实行按院编班、正式上课以来，由五月至七月，两个月的教育，从各方面检查结果，成绩至为可观，主要表现在学生文化水平之迅速提高与理论认识之长足进步，每个人的面目，几皆为之一新。
    最近，该校教职员学生，除一部自愿参加翻身队，下乡帮助发动群众及请假回籍省亲取物者外，留校员生进行暑期补习教育，正值时局紧张，国民党法西斯派与独夫蒋介石，勾结美帝国主义，出卖祖国发动大规模内战之时，学校当局发现学生中存在着偏重文化，忽视时事政治学习偏向，乃由校方秘书长罗青、教务长王振华、教务处副处长郭欠恒、工学院副主任刘大年，附设班主任张箕南等五位留校先生，组织五人委员会，整顿与推动夏令学习。于七月二十三日，开教职员干部会议，进行讨论，会上各教职员热烈发言，图书馆副主任兼历史与考古学家尹达先生指出目前蒋记法西斯连续暗杀李公朴闻一多两先生，乃蒋美反动派联合向中国人民作血腥的镇压，配合其对全国解放区开始大规模内战的信号，这一血的事实证明已不容许我们平静的埋头作长期的学术研究，假如没有独立、和平与民主的中国，学术研究将来为谁服务呢？为了保卫解放区与援助国民党统治区的和平民主运动，使大家对目前时局都有所警惕，准备并行动起来坚决的响应与支持范校长与五人委员会的号召，主张马上开展全校性的时事教育与加强战斗化的生活。尹达先生的发言，立刻引起全场，尤其是刚从北平来的学者王锦第、关太力诸先生的热烈赞成，当场又讨论通过有关夏令教学与生活整饬的几项决议。（康志）
