　　“A Day in the Life of a Nursery” Heads to America
　　People outside the Border Region can hardly imagine how happily the little babies of Yan'an live. The artist Comrade Meng Huafeng recently created a series of 25 comic strip drawings entitled "A Day in the Life of a Nursery" for the little angels' paradise – the Second Nursery. In addition to being displayed in Yan'an, a specially bound copy was presented to Ms. Soong Ching Ling (Soong is a Standing Committee member of the China Welfare Fund in Shanghai, and is keen to donate to help the Border Region's childcare cause) to soothe her distant thoughts. The American journalist Roy Singer, who recently left Yan'an, also took a copy to be read by people in the United States who care about the liberated areas.
　　Thirty Million "Xingzhi Scholarship"
　　The Yan'an Memorial Preparatory Committee for Mr. Tao Xingzhi wrote to the Border Region Government proposing to allocate 30 million Border Region currency as the "Xingzhi Scholarship," specifically to reward research work in primary school education in the Border Region; and to rename "Yan'an Middle School" as "Xingzhi Middle School." These two proposals to commemorate Mr. Xingzhi have been officially approved at the ninth administrative meeting of the Border Region Government.
　　Literary and Art Circles Discuss Current Tasks
　　The Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau convened literary and art circles to discuss the specific tasks of the literary and art circles. At the meeting, Propaganda Minister Li Zhuoran said: "The literary and art circles in the Border Region, following the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao at the Forum on Literature and Art, have begun to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have produced excellent works such as 'The White-Haired Girl' and 'Blood and Tears of Hatred.' However, there are still shortcomings in creation. In the future, we must learn from some model works such as 'Li Youcai's Rhymes,' constantly improve ourselves, and draw materials from actual life." Regarding current literary and art activities, Li proposed: "Under the severe situation of the Kuomintang reactionaries actively launching a full-scale civil war, the literary and art circles should write more works to encourage the masses' confidence in victory. At the same time, we should pay attention to strengthening the education of current affairs propaganda so that the broad masses of the people understand the current political situation. Therefore, literary and art workers must go to the countryside."
　　Lost and Found: Please Check the Notice Board
　　A lost and found notice board was hung on the wall of the New Market entrance. One day, it read: "Found: one donkey, one bar of soap, one key. Please come to the No. 2× office to claim." Many owners were overjoyed to find their lost items. The head of Luojiaping Township in Yan County lost a donkey three months ago and had given up hope. He found its whereabouts on the notice board. Before leaving, he bought the policeman a pack of cigarettes as a reward, but the policeman refused. According to the person in charge of the Public Security Bureau, in the past six months, the people have claimed the following items: 14 head of cattle, 6 horses, 22 donkeys, 4 taels of gold, 1 bar of soap, 2 towels, 1 toothbrush, 25 receipts, and 1 key.
　　Athletes Will Show Their Skills
　　The Border Region troops are currently assembling athletes to come to Yan'an to attend the "September 1st" Sports Meeting. It is reported that Xu Guang, a famous basketball player from the Seventh Branch School (who attended the Far Eastern Games), will form a basketball team to compete against Liu Shanben and other air force personnel. The Joint Defense Command has also formed a women's volleyball team and is currently stepping up practice after dinner every night. They will show their skills at the time.

　　“延安市闻”五则
            《保育院一天的生活》赴美
    边区以外的人们很难想像到延安的小宝宝们怎样过着幸福的生活。美术工作者孟化风同志，新近为小天使们的乐园——第二保育院——绘图二十五幅连环画《保育院一天的生活》，在延陈列展览外，特装订一本赠宋庆龄氏（宋为上海中国福利基金委员会常委，热心捐款帮助边区保育事业者），以慰遥念。最近离延的美国记者罗辛格，也带走一本给美国关心解放区的人士阅览。
        三千万“行知奖学金”
    延安追悼陶行知先生筹备会，致函边府提议拨付边币三千万元，作为“行知奖学金”，专门奖予边区小学教育的研究工作；把“延安中学”，改名“行知中学”。此两项纪念行知先生的提议，已在边府第九次政务会上正式通过。
            文艺界座谈当前任务
    西北局宣传部召集文艺界，座谈当前文艺界的具体任务，会上宣传部长李卓然说：“边区文艺界，遵循毛主席在文艺座谈会上所指出的方针，开始为工农兵服务，且产生了《白毛女》《血泪仇》等优秀作品，但创作方面仍有缺陷，今后要向一些模范作品如《李有才板话》等学习，不断提高自己，从实际生活中去吸取题材。对于目前文艺活动，李氏提出：在国民党反动派积极发动全面内战的严重局势下，文艺界在创作上多写鼓舞群众胜利信心的作品，同时应注意加强时事宣传的教育，使广大人民群众，了解当前的政治形势，因此文艺工作者必须下乡。
            失主请看招领牌
    新市场口的墙壁上，挂了一个招领牌，有一天上面写着“拾毛驴一头、肥皂一块、钥匙一把，希失主来二×所认领”。许多失主都喜出望外的找到了遗物。延县罗家坪乡长，在三个月前跑了一匹毛驴，他已经绝望了，又在领牌上找到下落，临走时他给警士买了一条纸烟作报答，警士谢而不收。据公安局负责人谈，半年来民众领回去的东西，有耕牛十四头、马六匹、毛驴二十二头、金子四两、肥皂一条、毛巾两条、牙刷一把、发单二十五张、钥匙一个。
            运动员将大显身手
    边区部队现正调集运动选手来延出席“九一”运动大会，闻七分校著名篮球选手徐光（曾出席远东运动会）将组成一队篮球队，与刘善本等空军人员对抗，联防司令部亦已组成一女子排球队，现每日晚饭后，正加紧练习，届时当大显身手。
