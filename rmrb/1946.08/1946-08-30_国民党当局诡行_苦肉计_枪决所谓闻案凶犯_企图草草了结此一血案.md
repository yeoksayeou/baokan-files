　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: In the Li-Wen assassination case, which shocked the world, the Kuomintang authorities, after unilaterally handling the investigation and trial, executed the so-called Wen case culprits, Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, in Kunming on the 26th in an attempt to hastily conclude this bloody incident. Note: After the Li-Wen bloody incident occurred, the Kuomintang authorities, with a guilty conscience, openly rejected the reasonable proposal of the Democratic League to form a tripartite investigation committee composed of the government, the Democratic League, and the United States. Simultaneously, they arrested a large number of local people in Kunming, subjected them to severe torture, and attempted to extract confessions by coercion and frame others. Later, they implemented a "sacrificial lamb" tactic, detaining Tang Shiliang, the company commander of the Special Service Battalion of the Kunming Garrison Headquarters, and Li Wenshan, a platoon leader, and labeling them as "Wen case culprits" to hold a trial. Upon hearing this, the Democratic League specially sent Liang Shuming and Zhou Xinmin to Kunming to investigate and sent a letter to Gu Zhutong stating that "After observing the Wen case, we found many doubts and request that a verdict not be made," while also requesting the authorities to publicly try the case. However, the Kuomintang authorities, fearing exposure, ignored the Democratic League's request and, with lightning speed, announced on the 26th that Tang and Li had been executed. At the same time, Gu Zhutong hosted reporters in Kunming, declaring that Tang and Li's assassination of Wen Yiduo was due to "Wen Yiduo's insulting remarks about the government, which aroused righteous indignation among the soldiers," and expressed "not without emotion" for Tang and Li's suffering of extreme punishment. He also stated that "I deeply hope that people across the country will not lightly destroy the hard-won country and give due care to the soldiers who shed blood in the war of resistance," as a pretext for continuing to assassinate democrats in the future. It is reported that Gu Zhutong told Liang Shuming that he hoped the Democratic League would consider the overall situation and not emphasize this matter further, attempting to conclude the bloody incident. Furthermore, under the pressure of national public opinion, the Kuomintang authorities have hypocritically dismissed Huo Kuizhang, the commander-in-chief of the Kunming Garrison. However, it is generally believed that in the near future, Huo Kuizhang will, like Guan Linzheng, the murderer of the "December 1st" bloody incident, return to the stage and be promoted.

　　国民党当局诡行“苦肉计”
    枪决所谓闻案凶犯
    企图草草了结此一血案
    【新华社延安二十七日电】震动中外的李闻被杀案，国民党当局在其一手包办调查审讯之后，已将所谓闻案凶犯汤时亮、李文山二人于廿六日在昆明执行枪决，以图草草了结此一血案。按：李闻血案发生后，国民党当局做贼心虚，公然拒绝民盟由政府、民盟及美国三方共组调查委员会的正当提议，同时即在昆明逮捕大批地方人士，酷刑拷打，企图屈打成招，嫁祸于人；后复实行“苦肉计”，将昆明警备司令部特务营连长汤时亮、排长李文山扣押，指为“闻案凶犯”，举行审讯。民盟闻讯，特派梁漱溟、周新民二氏赴昆调查，并致函顾祝同声明“观审闻案后，发现疑窦甚多，请勿定案”，同时要求当局将此案公开审讯。但国民党当局唯恐暴露马脚，不理民盟要求，并以迅雷不及掩耳之手段，于二十六日宣称已将汤、李二人执行枪决。与此同时，顾祝同在昆招待记者，声言汤、李之暗杀闻一多，系由于“闻一多辱骂政府，致军人激于义愤而起”，并对汤、李之身受极刑，表示“不无感慨”，且称“深盼全国人士对于艰难缔造之国家勿轻加毁辱，对于流血抗战之军人，给予应有之爱护”，以作今后继续暗杀民主人士之张本。据悉：顾祝同曾向梁漱溟表示，希望民盟顾全大局，对此勿再强调，企图就此了结血案。又在全国舆论压力之下，国民党当局已假惺惺的将昆明警备总司令霍揆彰撤职。惟一般咸信不久将来，霍揆彰定会如“一二一”血案的凶手关麟征一样，再行登台升官进爵。
