Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. "The Red Army has made a great contribution to accelerating Japan's surrender and defeat." This was the comment made by Soviet Colonel Voronin on Moscow Radio on the eighth, the first anniversary of the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan. Voronin first stated: Without the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan, it would be difficult to predict when the Pacific War would end. At that time, it was estimated that the Pacific War would continue until 1946, and according to the US military command's plan, it was not intended to capture the Japanese mainland until the autumn of 1946. Even if Japan lost its overseas island bases and the Japanese naval fleet, Japan could still continue to fight in its own country and could still maintain its powerful bases in Manchuria and Korea, where it could continue to counterattack. To defeat this strong resistance would require great efforts and a long struggle from the British and Americans. At the same time, the main forces of the British and Americans were still in Europe, and only after these troops were transported to the East could they participate in the struggle for Manchuria and Korea. After the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan, it crushed the Japanese Kwantung Army and liberated the people of Manchuria and Korea who had suffered so much. The Red Army's continued offensive provided direct assistance to the Chinese people who had suffered so much in the war. Voronin pointed out that during the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, the Soviet Union had contained a million elite Japanese troops in Manchuria and Korea, making it impossible for Japan to transport these troops to fight against the Chinese people and against the United States and Britain. The Red Army crushed this powerful army, causing Japanese imperialism to continue to collapse, thus greatly accelerating Japan's surrender. Voronin concluded by saying: In this way, the Red Army's powerful offensive against Japan's strategic defense supplemented the British, American, and Chinese strikes against the Japanese army and navy, and became the final and decisive blow. This major blow changed the military and political situation in the Pacific, accelerated the elimination of the source of war in the Far East, and thus created the possibility of universal peace.

　　太平洋战争能迅速结束红军参战具有决定意义     
    莫斯科广播评苏联对日宣战一周年
    【新华社延安九日电】“红军对加速日本投降与失败有重大的功勋”，这是莫斯科广播苏联渥伦尼上校八日在苏联对日宣战一年周年时发表的评论。渥氏首称：如果没有苏联参加对日战争，太平洋战争究竟什么时候结束，是困难预料的。当时估计太平洋战争要继续到一九四六年，而且按照美军指挥部的计划，在一九四六年秋始打算攻克日本本岛。纵使日本丧失了海外的岛屿根据地及日本海军舰队，但日本还能在本国继续战斗，而且仍能保持其强大的满洲与朝鲜根据地，在那里继续反攻。要击破这种坚强的反抗，需要英美很大的努力与长期的斗争。同时，英美的主力仍在欧洲，只有这些军队运到东方之后，始能参加争夺满洲与朝鲜的斗争。苏联加入反日战争后，粉碎了日本关东军，解放了受尽痛苦的满洲与朝鲜的人民。红军的继续进攻，给予在战争中受尽痛苦的中国人民以直接帮助。渥氏指出：中日战争及太平洋战争时期内，苏联曾牵制了在鲜满的百万精锐的日军，使日本没有可能把这些军队运去反对中国人民及对美英作战。红军粉碎了这一强大兵团，使日本帝国主义继续崩溃下去，因此大大加快了日本的投降。渥氏，结语力称：这样看来，红军对于日本战略防御之强大进攻，补充了英美中对于日本陆海军的打击，而且成为最终有决定意义的打击。这一重大打击，改变了太平洋军事政治情况，加快消灭了远东的战争源地，因而造成普遍和平的可能。
