　　Actively Support the Self-Defense War
    Zhang City Agencies Enthusiastically Donate Funds
    Southern Hebei Militia Intensify Suppression of Puppet Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 24th] Various agencies in the Border Region and Zhang City have launched a wave of saving and donating funds to support the self-defense war. Yao Yilin, Director of the Industry and Commerce Department, and others have requested a reduction or exemption from grain and winter clothing supplies, and have formulated personal production and savings plans. Li Zhengnan, Director of the Zhang City Finance Bureau, in addition to mobilizing his entire family to economize and donate 100,000 yuan, has also requested that his entire monthly salary be waived until Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is crushed. Recently, Fang Cai, an old cook of the CPC Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau, donated all of his accumulated savings of over 4,000 yuan and towels, soap, etc., earnestly instructing the administrative authorities to forward them to the front lines. Mr. Xu Zheng, an agricultural and forestry technician of the Border Region Administrative Committee, indignantly donated 100,000 yuan of his personal income. Liu Xingnong, a labor hero from an agency, donated all 120,000 yuan of his agricultural income from last year. When the blackboard newspaper at Bethune Medical University just announced "The front needs water bottles," the students immediately collected and donated 200 water bottles to the front lines. During the previous announcement that "Wounded soldiers need blood transfusions," 33 students immediately volunteered. International friend and medical professor, Dr.傍莱 (an Australian), also requested a monthly salary reduction of 340 catties of millet to donate to the soldiers defending the liberated areas. Li Dunbai (Sidney Rittenberg), Secretary of the China Aid Committee (an American), also donated 226 US dollars (equivalent to 500,000+ legal tender yuan) and wrote a letter of condolence in Chinese to the Eighth Route Army commanders and fighters at the front.
    [Reported by this newspaper from Wei County] Recently, Kuomintang special agents hidden underground in Pingyuan County have continued to carry out assassinations and sabotage. Armed groups led by Xie Huawu and Wang Junsheng are looting in the first district, attempting to join the remnants of defeated bandits led by Deng Xiechen in the seventh district of Gaotang, cutting off our connection between the first and fifth districts, and further encroaching on our liberated areas. In order to thoroughly combat the activities of special agents, the county is organizing the entire county's armed forces to resolve and eliminate the organized special agents, while also transferring more than 40 county and district cadres to form armed work teams to eliminate the special agents' henchmen and destroy their lower-level organizations. The joint defense armed work team was formed on August 5th and has already begun working in the countryside. Guo Qing, a puppet bandit from Linzhang County, has also continuously sent armed special agents to sabotage, assassinate, and extort grain and money. In order to ensure the smooth development of the peasant emancipation movement, the county has decided to strengthen armed anti-espionage work, improve the leadership of the second district headquarters, divide the entire district into four joint defense zones, each with a dedicated person in charge. They are establishing intelligence networks and conducting extensive propaganda and education among the puppet personnel. The militia guerrillas of the department are closely cooperating and actively taking action.
