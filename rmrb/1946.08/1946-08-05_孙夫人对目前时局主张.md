Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. Shanghai dispatch: Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching Ling, issued a statement on July 22nd regarding her proposals for the current situation. The original text is as follows:

　　In recent years, I have been fully dedicated to wartime relief work, strengthening China's resistance against Japan. I have avoided political disputes to prevent hindering this work. I preferred to remain silent, so that the whole country could focus on winning the war.

　　Now, there is no foreign enemy threatening our territory. We only have internal threats. We are suffering from internal threats. Reactionaries hope to involve the United States, thereby dragging the entire world into war. This civil war, though undeclared, has actually begun.

　　This disaster must be stopped from the beginning. Everyone with human feelings should speak out. Although I still wish to devote all my efforts to relief work, and I do not want my work to be hindered in any way, I feel that I must speak at this time.

　　The current crisis is not a question of who wins or loses between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It is a question of the Chinese people and their unity, liberation, and survival. This cannot be resolved by maintaining the balance of military power or bargaining over a city or a piece of land. What should be weighed is not the rights of the parties, but the rights of the people.

　　The people are anxiously hoping that the continuous negotiations will yield some results, but whenever a ceasefire agreement is barely reached, a new conflict immediately arises. Negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot make the final decision. The final decision must belong to the Chinese people. The solution, even if difficult, is very clear: that is, a correct understanding of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People—nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood—and their correct implementation today.

　　The meaning of nationalism today is that China does not belong to the Kuomintang, nor does it belong to the Communist Party. China is a country, a nation, but within this country, there are many political opinions. We must have a government that encompasses all the various opinions contributed by all the people.

　　The meaning of democracy today is that the Kuomintang's period of political tutelage has passed, and the constitutional era must begin. Our people have endured hardships to reach this stage, and they have proven that they should have the right to self-government.

　　A coalition government must be established immediately. The formation of this coalition government must not be solely based on the Kuomintang appointing candidates. All parties must elect their own representatives. The Kuomintang's representatives must also be elected by party members, and not appointed by a ruling clique from above. There are many factions within the Kuomintang, and progressive party members have never had the opportunity to speak. Now is the time to practice democracy and establish democracy.

　　Representatives elected in a democratic manner can then proceed to formulate a constitution, which will be recognized and approved by the people. The representatives must write into the constitution the essential basic freedoms that the Chinese people should have, not leaving them to the whims of a few who try to control them, but entrusting them entirely to the people themselves.

　　The meaning of people's livelihood today is that the people can no longer suffer from hunger, while corrupt officials accumulate wealth and honest officials have no way to voice their grievances. The land problem must be resolved reasonably. This is not incited by the Communist Party or external forces; it is the inevitable result of our own historical development. A hundred years ago, the peasants' disturbances led to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising. The people have the right to rise up against feudalism and colonialism, which is an undeniable fact; today, the people have this right, and it cannot be denied.

　　"Land to the tiller" is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition, which was adopted by the Kuomintang's First National Congress. This is the basic solution to China's famine. Did not the head of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration recently say that there is no famine in the Communist areas? Why? Because they followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan and distributed the land to the tillers. Such consideration for the people's livelihood should be considered in all regions of the country.

　　The Kuomintang must fulfill its historical mission, leading the people to a complete solution through a coalition government, democratic politics, and land reform. If this mission can be accomplished, the Kuomintang will undoubtedly be the leading party in any coalition government, and it will be supported by many people belonging to other parties, including those parties that have no military force and therefore no power to speak in negotiations. We must let freedom replace corruption, tyranny, terror, suppression, and political assassinations. Unless the Kuomintang immediately completes these tasks, it should bear the responsibility for causing the civil war.

　　Civil war cannot bring us unity, liberation, and stability of the people's livelihood. Civil war brings chaos, hunger, and destruction to the Chinese people.

　　We will see cities and peasants isolated. Peasants will support the Communist Party, which gives them land and reduces taxes. In that case, how will the Kuomintang's cities get raw materials, exports, and even food? Bayonets cannot be used for harvesting. The inflation that has already swallowed many cities will be a hundred times more terrible than it is today. The Kuomintang cannot win in such a war. These are well-known facts. Then, why do the reactionaries want to launch a war that they cannot win? Because they hope that China's internal strife will cause a war between the United States and the Soviet Union, thereby ultimately destroying the Chinese Communist Party.

　　The American people are the Chinese people's allies and long-time friends. They must know the truth about this road to disaster. They must know the fact that the American reactionaries and the Chinese reactionaries are colluding and encouraging each other. They must know that the presence of American troops on Chinese soil cannot promote peace and order among the Chinese people. They must be warned that loans should only be given to a reorganized and truly representative Chinese government. They must know that if the United States can frankly state that it will no longer supply military supplies and military assistance, the Chinese civil war will not expand and develop.

　　Today, the first spark of world war is burning on our land again! It must be extinguished, otherwise the flames will destroy the whole world! I call on the leaders of the two major parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as the leaders of other parties and factions in China, to immediately form a coalition government. I call on our American friends to facilitate this action by stopping all arms supplies and only allowing aid to be given to a government belonging to the Chinese people.

### 孙夫人对目前时局主张

　　孙夫人对目前时局主张
    【新华社延安二日电】沪讯：孙夫人宋庆龄女士于七月二十二日发表对目前时局主张，其原文如下：
    近年来我完全致力于战时救济工作外，增强中国的抗战力量，我避开政治的论争。以免妨碍这项工作，我宁守缄默，使全国能集中注意以赢取战争的胜利。
    现在没有外敌在威胁我们的国土了，我们有的只是内部的威胁，我们正受着内部的威胁，反动者希望把美国卷入，从而把全世界拖入战争中。这一内战虽未经宣布，而实际上已开始。
    这一灾难，必须从头就加以制止，每一具有人类感情的人，应当说话了，虽然我仍愿以全力从事救济工作，并且我不愿我的工作受到任何阻碍，然而，我觉得这时候非说话不可了。
    目前的危机不是在国共之间谁胜谁败的问题，这是中国人民以及他们的团结解放和生存的问题，这不能从保持军事力量的对比或者在一城一地的讨价还价上求取解决的，应该权衡的不是党派的权利，而是人民的权利。
    人民对于不断继续的谈判，焦切盼望其能有若干结果，但每当一个停战协议勉强达成以后，新的冲突即随之而起。国共之间的谈判不能作最后之决定，最后决定必须属于中国的人民。解决的方案纵使困难，却非常明白，那就是对于中山先生的三民主义——民族、民权、民生——加以正确的了解，及其在今日的正确实施。
    民族主义在今日的意义，是指中国不属于国民党，也不属于共产党，中国是一个国家一个民族，但在这个国家内有许多政治的意见，我们必须有一个政府包容全部人民所贡献的各种意见。
    民权主义在今日的意义，是指国民党的训政时期已经过去了，宪政时期必须开始，我国人民含辛茹苦才达到这一阶段，他们已证明应该有自治的权利。
    联合政府必须立即成立，这个联合政府的产生，必不能单由国民党指派人选，各党派必须选出他们自己的代表，国民党的代表也必须由党员选出，而不能由上面一个统治集团加以指派。国民党内有许多派别，而进步的党员一直没有机会发言，现在是实践民主建立民主的时候了。
    代表从民主方式选出，他们则可进行制定宪法，这宪法将会得到人民的承认和批准。代表们必须在宪法中写上中国人民应有其不可缺少的基本自由，不要任凭那少数企图控制者反复无常，而要完全交托在人民自己的手中。
    民生主义在今日是指人民不能再受饥饿，一方面让贪官污吏厚积财富，另方面使忠良官吏诉苦无门。土地问题必须合理解决，这并不是共产党或外力的煽动，这是我们本身历史发展的必然结果。一百年前农民的骚动，造成了太平天国的起事，人民有权利起来反抗封建主义与殖民地主义，这已是无可否认的事；今天人民有这种权利，也不容被否认。
    “耕者有其田”是中山先生的主张，这曾经获取国民党第一次全国代表大会的通过，这是救治中国饥荒的基本方案。行总的署长最近不是说过在中共区内没有灾荒吗，为什么？因为他们遵从中山先生的方案，把土地分配给耕者。这样为民生的打算，在全国各地区应予以考虑。
    国民党必须执行它的历史任务，领导人民，经由联合政府民权政治及土地改革，达到完全解决。这一个使命如能完成，国民党在任何联合政府中，无疑的都会是领导的政党，他将得到许多属于其他党派的人民的拥护，包括那些没有军队因而在谈判中也无力发言的政党。我们必须让自由的××代替贪污暴政恐怖镇压与政治暗杀，除非国民党立即完成这些任务，他就应担负造成内战的责任。
    内战不能带给我们以团结解放和民生的安定，内战带给中国人民以混乱饥饿与破坏。
    我们将见到城市和农民被隔绝，农民会拥护给他们土地和减低租税的共产党，这样，国民党的城市怎样得到原料输出品以至粮食？枪刺不能用以收获，已经吞灭了许多城市的通货膨胀，将千百倍可怕于今日，国民党不能在这样的战争中取得胜利，这些已是众所周知的事，那么，何以反动者还要发动一个他们所不能取胜的战争呢？因为他们希望中国的内争会引起美苏战争，从而在最后摧毁中国的共产党。
    美国人民是中国人民的同盟者和长久的友人，他们必须知道这条走向灾祸之路的真相，他们必须知道美国的反动者与中国的反动者狼狈为奸相互鼓励的事实，他们必须知道美军的驻在中国土地上，并不能增进中国人民间的和平与秩序，他们必须被警告借款只应给与一个改组了的真正具有代表性的中国政府，他们必须知道若使美国能够坦白表示将不再供给军需品与军事援助，中国的内战就不会扩大发展。
    今日世界战争的第一个烽火，又在我们的土地上燃烧起来了！它必须扑灭，否则那火焰将毁灭全世界！我要求中国国共两大党以及其他各党各派的领袖，立即组成一个联合政府；我要求我们的美国友人，以停止一切军火供应只允许把援助给予一个属于中国人民的政府，来促成这一行动。
