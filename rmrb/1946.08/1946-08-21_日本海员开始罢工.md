　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese sailors began a strike on the 17th. Negotiations between the All-Japan Seamen's Union and the Japanese shipping authorities regarding the living conditions of sailors broke down on the 16th after the shipping authorities refused the sailors' demands. Five ships sailing from Kobe to Yokohama were stopped mid-journey due to their sailors' strike. In the past, the Japanese government's control over sailors was extremely strict, and no strikes had occurred since the surrender. This strike can be said to be the first in twelve years.
    At the same time, the Tokyo Radio Station Workers' Union warned the authorities that if they persisted in their errors, left the workers to starve, and continued to reject the union's demands, they would launch a strike and call for a nationwide general strike of the industry.

　　日本海员开始罢工
    【新华社延安十八日电】东京讯：日本海员于十七日开始发动罢工。全日本海员工会与日本航运当局关于海员生活待遇的谈判于十六日由于航运当局拒绝海员要求而宣告破裂后，即有五艘由神户驶往横滨的轮船于中途因其海员罢工而停航。过去日本政府对海员控制至为严格，投降以来尚未发生罢工，此次罢工可谓十二年来第一次。
    同时东京广播电台职工会向当局提出警告，假如当局执迷不悟，置员工于饥饿，再拒绝工会要求，即将发动罢工，并号召全国同业总罢工。
