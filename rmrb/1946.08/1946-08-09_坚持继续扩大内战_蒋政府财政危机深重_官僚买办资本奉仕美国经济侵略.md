Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: The Chiang Kai-shek government's financial crisis is deepening with the continuation and expansion of the civil war. According to Shanghai newspapers, the actual expenditure for the first five months of this year, ending in May, has already exceeded the 250 million yuan that the authorities publicly announced as the entire year's budget. With prices continuing to rise, it is estimated that the average expenditure for the remaining seven months of this year will be at least double the average for the first five months. The total expenditure for the year will be at least 800 million *wan* yuan (three *wan* characters). The massive expenditure is caused by the civil war. Military expenses accounted for 60 percent of the total expenditure in the first five months of this year, and it is estimated that it will increase significantly in the second half of the year. However, in terms of the Chiang government's revenue, tax revenue calculated in currency can only offset 8 percent of the total expenditure. Even with the addition of enemy and puppet extortion and business income, the figure is still extremely large. According to Yu Hongjun's remarks quoted in the August 6th issue of the Shanghai *China Weekly Review*, the revenue for the first five months only offset 15 percent of the expenditure, and the remaining 85 percent had to rely on issuing currency. It is also learned that by the end of last year, the number of banknotes issued by the Kuomintang was 100.3 million *wan* yuan (more than 7,000 times the 140,000 *wan* yuan before the war). According to a special article in the Shanghai *Democracy* weekly on July 6th, it is estimated that by the end of this year, the number of issues will approach the astonishing figure of 200 million *wan* yuan (three *wan* characters).

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: Shanghai News: Kuomintang comprador bureaucratic capital is monopolizing import businesses and serving the economic aggression of American imperialism. The vast majority of enemy and puppet industries have not yet resumed operations under their monopolistic takeover. In Shanghai alone, as of the end of May, after ten months, only 73 of the "state-owned" factories taken over had started operations, accounting for only 11 percent of the number of factories taken over. However, since the implementation of the controlled foreign exchange policy in early March, many large monopoly import companies have been organized by the descendants of bureaucrats. Kong Xiangxi's son, Kong Lingjue, organized the Yangtze Construction Company, with a capital of 500 million US dollars, which is equivalent to the amount of the Sino-US loan. Another company of Kong Xiangxi's is the Yangtze River Company. Currently, Kong Xiangxi has ordered a large number of warehouses from the United States in the name of the company, and recently ordered another batch of goods from the United States. The Yangtze River Company is the protagonist of the recent grain loan fraud case in Shanghai, which has been exposed by the inspector Cheng Zhongxing. Song Ziwen's brother, Song Ziliang, also organized a China Import and Export Trading Company. There is also a company with close ties to bureaucratic capital, the Fuzhong Company, which is run by the son of Yu Qiaqing and also engages in the import "business." The Kong and Song financial groups have extremely close ties with the reactionary monopoly capital of the United States. They have a large amount of foreign exchange deposited in the United States, and can obtain foreign exchange supply from the Central Bank at will, and can also use the transportation tools of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Recently, a transport brigade including 230,000 tons of ships was established under the Relief Administration of the Executive Yuan as a tool to transport American goods to the interior for dumping. Shanghai democrats believe that the result of the Kong and Song comprador bureaucratic capital serving the dumping of American imperialist goods with all their strength will strangle national industry and lead to the collapse of the national economy.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Nanjing News: Wang Yunwu stated in an economic report at the Kuomintang Central Memorial Week yesterday that the Ministry of Economic Affairs received a total of 2,411 factory and mine units in Northeast China, Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Taiwan, of which only 852 units have resumed operations, accounting for only 37 percent of the total received; in addition, 210 units that were not resumed by the Ministry also accounted for only 8 percent of the total received. And there are still 951 units of the received enterprises in various regions of the country that have not been processed. He also said that of the 500,000 *wan* yuan listed as income from the sale of enemy and puppet materials in the government's total budget for this year, only a small amount has been actually received so far.

　　坚持继续扩大内战
    蒋政府财政危机深重
    官僚买办资本奉仕美国经济侵略
    【新华社延安五日电】蒋介石政府的财政危机，随着内战的延续与扩大而深刻化。据沪报披露：到五月底止，今年头五个月的实际支出已超过当局公开宣布的全年预算二万五千万万元。在物价继续不断高涨的情况下，估计今年后七个月平均支出至少为前五个月平均数的两部。全年支出至少为八万万万（三个万字）元。庞大的支出是由内战所造成的。今年头五月的军事费占全支出百分之六十，估计下半年还要大大增加。但在蒋政府收入方面，以货币计算的税收，只能抵全部支出的百分之八。加上敌伪敲榨及营业收入，数字仍极端庞大。据八月六日沪密勒氏评论报引俞鸿钧谈话，头五个月收入只抵支出的百分之十五，其余百分之八十五，只好依靠发钞。另悉：到去年底为止，国民党发钞数目字为十万零三千万万元（为战前十四万万元的七千余倍）。据七月六日上海《民主》周刊专文估计，到今年底，发行数目将迫近二十万万万（三个万字）元之惊人数目。
    【新华社南京六日电】沪讯：国民党买办官僚资本正垄断进口事业，为美国帝国主义的经济侵略服务。敌伪工业在他们垄断接收下，至今绝大部分尚未复工。仅上海一地，截至五月底止，经过了十个月，接收的“国营”工厂，开工的只七十三家，占接收工厂数百分之十一。但自三月初实行的统制外汇政策，和官僚后代们已组织了好多大的垄断进口的公司。孔祥熙之子孔令觉组织了扬子建业公司，资本达五万万美金，与中美借款的数目竟然相埒。另一个孔祥熙的公司是长江公司，目前孔祥熙以该公司的名义向美国订购了大批货仓，最近又向美订了一批货物。长江公司乃是最近上海粮贷舞弊案的主角，已为监察使程中行所揭露。宋子文之弟宋子良也组织了一个中国进出口贸易公司，还有一个与官僚资本有亲密联系的公司——阜中公司，为虞洽卿之子所办，亦经营进口“事业”。孔宋财团与美国反动的独占资本有极亲密的联结，他们有大批外汇存放美国，并可以随意取得中央银行外汇供给，又可用招商局的运输工具。最近复在行政院救济总署之下成立了载运大队，包括二十三万吨船只，作为运送美货至内地倾销的工具。沪民主人士认为孔宋买办官僚资本如此全力为美国帝国主义商品倾销服务的结果，将绞杀民族工业，使民族经济崩溃。
    【新华社延安六日电】南京讯：王云五昨日在国民党中枢纪念周上作经济报告时称：经济部在东北、冀、热、察、绥、豫、鲁、晋、苏、浙、皖、湘、鄂、粤、赣、粤、桂、闽、台湾等区接收厂矿，总数共计二千四百一十一单位，已复工者只八百五十二单位，仅占接收总数百分之三十七；此外其非由该部复工者二百一十单位，亦仅占接收总数百分之八。而全国各区接收事业，至今还没有处理者尚有九百五十一单位。又谓：本年度政府总预算中，列为变卖敌伪物资收入之五十万万元，迄今实际收入只有少数。
