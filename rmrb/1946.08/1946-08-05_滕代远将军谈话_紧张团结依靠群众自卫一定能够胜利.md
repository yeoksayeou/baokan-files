　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 2nd: General Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army, recently passed through the Suwan Border Region and made a statement to this agency's reporter, saying: The reactionaries have recently launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas, especially against the Central Plains and Central China Military Regions. However, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, Wang Shusheng, and others led their troops to break through and inflicted great blows on the invading army together with the military and civilians of Central China, which has frustrated the military conspiracy of the reactionaries. General Teng expressed his appreciation for the firm and heroic self-defense of the military and civilians of Suwan, who have repeatedly annihilated the main force of the invading army. He believes that a large amount of annihilation of the enemy's living forces is an important factor in determining the final victory or defeat, and the temporary advance or retreat of a city or place is not important. In this Suzhong self-defense war, not only were 25,000 invading troops annihilated, but also the number of weapons seized was unprecedented, which will help to further strengthen the Central China People's Liberation Army and the people's armed forces. What is especially important is that this strong self-defense fully proves that we have the strength to defend the liberated areas, defend peace and democracy, and defeat all the offensives of the reactionaries. He said: As long as we are tensely united and rely on the masses, without arrogance or complacency, self-defense will surely be victorious. General Teng was extremely indignant at the crimes of the Kuomintang's planes indiscriminately bombing everywhere, causing serious damage to the lives and property of innocent people; he highly praised the democratic government's work in providing relief and assistance. General Teng solemnly stated in conclusion: If the reactionaries do not stop their offensive for a single day, the military and civilians of the liberated areas cannot stop their self-defense and resistance for a single day. If the reactionaries continue to act recklessly, their strength will become increasingly dispersed, and they will be enemies everywhere they go deep into our liberated areas, and they will inevitably suffer a more powerful blow from our army. At the same time as attacking the liberated areas, the reactionaries are brutally suppressing the democratic movement throughout the country, and assassinating Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. This perverse act will undoubtedly arouse a more enthusiastic and widespread movement to defend peace and democracy throughout the country. The reactionaries' use of such barbaric and despicable means does not indicate that they have strength, but rather shows their increasing decline. General Teng finally solemnly stated: We do not hope for war; we, like the people of the whole country, are eagerly looking forward to the realization of peace and democracy. We are forced to resolutely defend ourselves in order to defend peace and democracy, so as long as the reactionaries stop their offensive actions and withdraw from the occupied areas, peace negotiations can be realized.

　　滕代远将军谈话
    紧张团结依靠群众自卫一定能够胜利
    【新华社淮阴二日电】十八集团军副参谋长滕代远将军，日前路过苏皖边区，对本社记者发表谈话称：反动派最近全面进攻解放区，尤以对中原、华中两军区最为猛烈，但中原李先念、王震、王树声等率部突破，与华中军民予进犯军以极大打击，已使反动派之军事阴谋遭到挫折。滕将军于对苏皖军民坚决英勇自卫，数次歼灭进犯军主力，表示嘉许。渠认为大量消灭对方有生力量，为决定最后胜负之重要因素，一城一地之暂时进退，无关重要。此次苏中自卫战中，不但消灭进犯军两万五千之众，而且缴获武器之多，在此可称为空前未有，此对进一步加强华中子弟兵与人民武装力量不无帮助。尤其重要的是此次坚强自卫，充分证明了我们有力量保卫解放区，保卫和平民主，战胜一切反动派的进攻。他说：只要我们紧张团结依靠群众，不骄不馁，自卫一定能够胜利。滕将军对蒋方飞机到处滥肆轰炸，使无辜人民生命财产遭受严重损害之罪行，极为愤恨；对民主政府之安抚与救济工作颇加赞扬。滕将军最后郑重表示：反动派一日不停止进攻，解放区军民便一日不能停止自卫抵抗，反动派如一味蛮干下去，则由于其力量之日益分散，深入我解放区处处与之为敌，势必遭受我军更有力的打击。与进攻解放区同时，反动派在全国范围内残酷镇压民主运动，暗杀民盟中委李公朴、闻一多两先生，这种倒行逆施无疑将引起全国更热烈更广泛的保卫和平民主运动，反动派出此野蛮卑劣手段，不是表示他们有力量，而是说明他们的日渐衰落。滕将军最后郑重表示：我们并不希望战争，我们和全国人民一样切盼和平民主的实现，我们被迫坚决自卫，也是为了保卫和平民主，所以只要反动派停止进攻行动，退出侵占区，则和平谈判可以实现。
