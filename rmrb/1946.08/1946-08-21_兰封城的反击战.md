　　The Counter-Attack at Lanfeng City

　　Lanfeng was an important military stronghold for Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the Longhai Railway, concentrating a large number of troops and tanks, constantly attacking our liberated areas.

　　Since last year, after Chiang's troops occupied our counties of Qi, Taikang, Tongxu, Fugou, Minquan, and Kaocheng, they recently deployed troops and generals to attack the Third and Fifth Sub-districts north of the Longhai Railway. Although our army has been retreating step by step, Chiang's troops have been pressing closer and closer. On the evening of the 10th of this month, our local Eighth Route Army, unable to endure it any longer, was forced to launch a self-defensive counter-attack against the invading troops, cutting off the main artery of Chiang's troops' transportation of troops and weapons – the Longhai Railway – and liberating Lanfeng City.

　　(1) Heroic and Tragic Battle Mobilization

　　Before the battle, the head of a certain unit issued a powerful call to all commanders and fighters. He called on every commander and fighter to bring out our patriotic and people-loving enthusiasm and courage to eliminate the traitorous army and strive to be a hero in killing the enemy, a model worker, and strive for victory in the battle. This call quickly generated a powerful force among all commanders and fighters. Each unit responded to this call with the highest enthusiasm and proposed competitions and challenges. Among all the commanders and fighters of Unit 6052, after the competition was proposed, every commander and fighter was determined to sacrifice. Zhao Wengang, the acting squad leader of the Third Squad, handed over his 3,000 Jiao of Hebei currency and 500 yuan in stocks as Party dues and made a will. Deputy Instructor Hou Jianjun also resolved to sacrifice, handed over his savings of 9,000 yuan as Party dues, and left three photos as souvenirs. In Unit 6050, 90% of the Communist Party members expressed their attitude. Many cadres and soldiers were determined to sacrifice, handing over all their savings to the public. Squads, platoons, teams, cooks, and communicators all formulated their own combat plans, determined to strive to complete the competition plan.

　　(2) The Restoration of Lanfeng City

　　The Second Company of Unit 6046 was responsible for launching a self-defensive counter-attack against the invading troops. Just ten minutes after the charge was launched, the Second Company was already standing on the head of Lanfeng City. The first comrade to climb the city was Cui Guizhen of the Sixth Squad. When his heroic figure appeared on the head of Lanfeng City, the sound of exploding machine guns and hand grenades powerfully depicted the emergence of a hero. In the storm of steel, he showed his firm and tenacious heroic qualities. Although the Second Company was a new recruit company established only last year, they all demonstrated a high degree of bravery and skill in combat. It only took five minutes to rush into the city. In the charge, the company commander, political instructor, and second and third platoon engineers were wounded one after another. The political instructor walked with a limp, but everyone refused to leave the front line. They had only one determination: to quickly eliminate the enemy. The wounded company commander commanded the troops without stopping, continuing to fight the enemy. The enemies in Lanfeng City surrendered one after another. Only a portion of the remaining Chiang Kai-shek troops and a tank company, totaling more than 300 people, were still using their new weapons to attack us fiercely. Our army bravely rushed up, and by six o'clock, all the tanks were lying quietly on our army's position. This tank unit was originally the tank squadron of the Fourth Appeasement Zone under the Zhengzhou Appeasement Headquarters of Chiang's army. It had been in Lanfeng for more than 40 days, its purpose being to cooperate with the infantry to attack the liberated areas. The tank equipment included a flat-firing gun and two light machine guns per tank. Now, it has become an irony of Chiang Kai-shek's internal war of national betrayal. The flag of independence and freedom was planted on the head of Lanfeng City for the first time.

　　兰封城的反击战
    兰封是蒋介石军队在陇海铁路上的重要军事据点，集中了大量的部队和坦克，不断向我解放区进攻。
    自去年蒋军将我杞县、太康、通许、扶沟、民权、考城等县城侵占后，近又调兵遣将，向陇海路以北三、五分区进攻，我军虽节节退让，蒋军则步步紧逼。本月十日晚，我当地八路军在忍无可忍下，被迫问进犯军作自卫反攻，割断了蒋军运输军队武器的大动脉——陇海铁路，解放了兰封城。
            （一）英勇壮烈的战斗动员
    某部首长在战斗前，向全军指战员发出了有力的号召，他号召每一个指战员，都拿出我们爱国爱人民的热忱与勇敢，去消灭卖国贼的军队，争取做个杀敌英雄、模范工作者，争取战斗的胜利。这个号召，很快就在全体指战员中产生了强大的力量，各部队以最高的热忱，响应了这一号召，提出了竞赛和挑战。在六○五二部队全体指战员中，当竞赛提出之后，每一个指战员都抱定了牺牲的决心，三分队代理分队长赵文刚同志，交出自己的冀钞三千元，及股票五百元，作为党费，并立下遗嘱；副教导员侯建军也抱定牺牲的决心，交出自己的积蓄九千元的党费，并留下照片三张作为纪念。在六○五○部队中，百分之九十的共产党员，都表示了态度，许多干部战士都下定牺牲决心，把自己多年的积蓄全部交公，连、排、班、炊事员、通讯员都定了自己的战斗计划，决心要争取竞赛计划的完成。
            （二）兰封城的光复
    担任向进犯军作自卫反击的是六○四六部队的二连，刚发起冲锋号十分钟，二连就已经站在兰封城头上了，登城的头一名是六班崔桂珍同志，当他的战斗的英姿出现在兰封城头的时候，爆炸成一片的机枪和手榴弹的声音，有力的描写了一个英雄的出现。在钢铁的暴风雨中，表现了他坚定、顽强的英雄本色。二连虽是在去年才成立的新兵连，他们在战斗中，都表现了高度的英勇和熟练，只用了五分钟就冲到城里去了。在冲锋中连长、政指、二、三排工兵先后负伤，政指两腿一拐一拐的走着，大家都不下火线，他们只有一个决心，迅速的消灭敌人。受伤的连长毫不停息的指挥部队，继续和敌人战斗着。在兰封城里的敌人，都先后缴械了，只有一部分残余的蒋介石军队和坦克车连队，共三百余人，仍凭其新式武器向我猛烈攻击，我军奋勇冲上去，至六时全部战车都静静的躺在我军阵地上。这个战车队，本为蒋军驻郑州绥署所辖第四绥区坦克中队，共坦克十一辆、汽车四辆，开来兰封已四十余日，其目的为配合步兵，向解放区进攻。战车装备，每辆坦克装有平射炮一门，轻机枪两挺。现在，成了蒋介石进行卖国内战一个讽刺，独立自由的旗帜第一次插在兰封城头上。
