　　[This Newspaper, Handan, 20th] Comrade Zhang Jichun, Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Region, recently convened a meeting with comrades from direct subordinate units departing for frontline inspection work, and gave a speech on the central task of current political work. He began by stating: Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, with the assistance of American imperialist elements, has launched a reactionary large-scale offensive that undermines peace and democracy and betrays the nation-state. Following the siege of our Central Plains Fifth Division, they have proceeded to attack our eastern Henan, Shandong, central Jiangsu, northern Huai, and southern Shanxi regions. Recently, they have further provoked conflicts in Jehol and eastern Henan. Their planes are also bombing everywhere, having bombed Huaiyin, Jining, and other places, and most recently, Yan'an. In the rear areas, they are suppressing democracy everywhere, and have recently even brutally murdered democratic figures. Chiang Kai-shek is now forcing the entire people to their death. Our task today is to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's attacking troops and shatter Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale offensive. Only by shattering Chiang Kai-shek's offensive can we restore peace, realize democracy, and guarantee national independence. He then pointed out that the first central task of today's political work is to make every officer and soldier aware of the current situation and the sacred task of the patriotic self-defense war, to raise everyone's level of awareness, political sense of responsibility, and combat courage, and to believe that our operations are just and reasonable actions. We have the firm support of the people and democratic figures across the country, and our self-defense operations represent the demands of the people across the country, related to peace and democracy, and related to the survival and independence of the nation. Everyone must conscientiously carry out this task of the patriotic self-defense war, so that all officers and soldiers strengthen unity, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory in the war. Second, ensure the enforcement of military discipline in the troops. We must be more organized and disciplined, united as one, acting and marching in unison, obeying orders and commands. Only in this way can we be stronger and more easily shatter Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Third, ensure the implementation of the policy of winning over the masses and political discipline. The combat is for the people's peace, democracy, and national liberation. Without the people, there can be no victory. When all personnel come into contact with the masses, they must publicize to the masses, explaining Chiang Kai-shek's destruction of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, his destruction of peace and democracy, his brutal killing of the people and democratic figures, and the crimes of American imperialist elements assisting Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war. Explain why we must defend ourselves and shatter Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. But we must also first ensure that all personnel cherish the interests of the masses in action and strictly enforce the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. For the few who violate discipline, after education, we must mobilize everyone to supervise their actions, and at the same time, we must punish those who violate discipline. This is very important and must be constantly educated and inspected to truly achieve not taking even a needle or thread from the people. Fourth, ensure the enforcement of economic discipline. In our self-defense war, we must recover some cities and villages and seize many supplies. These must be guaranteed to belong to the public. As for the difficulties that many troops have to solve in combat, and the rewards for the merits of some troops in combat, these should be done entirely according to the circumstances. Fifth, to consolidate the troops, we must care for the soldiers. Enhance the atmosphere of revolutionary friendship, mobilize mutual love and mutual help, and constantly carry out political education. We must conduct vigorous education based on the changing situation and the many practical materials of the troops, in order to consolidate and enhance the combat mood. Sixth, ensuring the improvement of military skills in the course of combat should also become the central task of political work. Ensure a high degree of enthusiasm for training skills and ensure the improvement of combat morale. We should ensure that we train troops whenever there is a gap, and that everyone trains automatically, so that we have a guarantee of military skills in shattering Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Seventh, every comrade must be educated to implement the policy on prisoners of war. Win over prisoners of war, disintegrate the enemy army, everyone should not take the personal belongings of prisoners of war, everyone should propagandize to the enemy soldiers, making them passive and disgusted with the civil war, even to the point of striking, and finally rising up and standing on the side of the people. Eighth, the successful completion of all the above work is inseparable from the leadership and activities of the Party. In the self-defense war, the work of the Party branches in the troops must be strengthened. First of all, we must raise the special responsibility of ordinary Party members in the war. Whether in understanding the task, bravely fighting, enforcing military and political discipline, consolidating troops and practicing skills, or disintegrating the enemy army, they must show their significant initiative. And through them, unite the broad masses of non-Party soldiers to complete all tasks.

　　直属队同志出发前线巡视工作
　　张副政委召集讲话
　　指出目前政治工作中心任务
    【本报邯郸二十日讯】军区张副政委际春同志顷就目前政治工作的中心任务，召集直属队出发前线巡视工作的同志讲话。首称：蒋介石国民党在美帝国主义分子援助下所发动的破坏和平民主，与出卖民族国家的反动的大举进攻已经开始了。继围攻我们中原五师之后，接着进攻我们的豫东、山东、苏中、淮北、晋南，最近更向热河、豫东挑衅。他的飞机亦到处轰炸，炸了淮阴、济宁等地，最近更炸延安。在大后方则到处压制民主，最近更惨杀民主人士。蒋介石现在是要逼迫全人民于死地。我们今天的任务是消灭蒋介石进攻的部队，粉碎蒋介石的大举进攻。只有粉碎了蒋介石的进攻，才能恢复和平，实现民主保证民族的独立。继即指出，今天政治工作的第一个中心，是使每个指战员认识今天的形势，和爱国自卫战争的神圣任务，提高大家的觉悟程度，政治责任心，与作战勇气，相信我们的作战是正当的合理的行动。我们有全国人民和民主人士的坚决赞助，我们的自卫作战是代表全国人民要求，关系于和平民主，关系于民族的生存独立。大家必须认真的执行这一爱国自卫战争的任务，使全体官兵加强团结克服一切困难，争取战争的胜利。第二、保证部队军事纪律的执行。必须更有组织有纪律，万众一心，统一行动与步调，听命令指挥，这样才更有力量，更易于粉碎蒋介石的进攻。第三、保证争取群众和政治纪律的实行。作战是为了人民的和平民主和民族的解放，离开了人民就不能胜利。全体人员和群众接触时，必须宣传群众，说明蒋介石破坏政协决议，破坏和平民主，惨杀人民及民主人士，以及美帝国主义分子援助蒋介石打内战的罪行。说明我们为什么要自卫，粉碎蒋介石的进攻。但还必须首先保证全体人员在行动上爱护群众利益，严格执行三大纪律八项注意。对于少数犯纪律者经过教育后，必须动员大家来监督他们的行动，同时还必须处罚犯纪律的。这点很重要，必须经常教育检查，真正要做到秋毫无犯。第四、保证经济纪律的执行。我们在自卫战争中一定要收复一些城市乡村，并缴获许多物资，这些必须保证归公。至于在作战中，许多部队有困难要解决，有的部队作战有功要奖励，应整个根据情况来作。第五、巩固部队必须关心战士。提高革命友爱的空气，动员互相爱护，互相帮助，不断的进行政治教育。必须根据时局变化，用部队的许多实际材料，进行有力的教育，以巩固提高作战情绪。第六、在作战过程中，保证提高军事技术，也应成为政工中心任务。保证高度的锻炼技术的情绪和保证作战情绪提高。应保证一有空隙就练兵，大家自动练，这样就使我们在粉碎蒋介石的进攻中，军事技术有了保证。第七、必须教育每一个同志执行俘虏政策。争取俘虏，瓦解敌军，大家不拿俘虏私人的东西，大家向敌军士兵作宣传，使其消极厌恶内战，以至罢战，最后起义站到人民方面来。第八、上述一切工作的做好完成，是与党的领导与活动分不开的。在自卫作战中，部队中党的支部工作必须加强。首先要提高一般党员在战争中的特殊责任，无论在认识任务，勇敢作战，执行军事政治纪律，巩固部队练技术，瓦解敌军的各方面，都要表现出他们显著的积极性。并通过他们去团结广大非党士兵，完成一切任务。
