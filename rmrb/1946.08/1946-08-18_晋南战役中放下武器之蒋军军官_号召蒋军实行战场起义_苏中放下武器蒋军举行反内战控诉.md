　　[Report from our Yangcheng correspondent] With the Nationalist 30th Army reinforcing Jinan, the war situation has become tense again. Last month, on the 13th, Chiang's army officers of the 91st and 92nd Regiments of the 31st Division who laid down their arms in the battle of Ruzhang, Wenxi, recently issued an open letter to the Nationalist army soldiers and officers attacking the Jinan Liberated Area, calling on them to stage battlefield uprisings and join hands with the Eighth Route Army to oppose the civil war. The signatories include Liang Zangwei, lieutenant colonel and deputy head of the 92nd Regiment, Lin Yongkang, lieutenant colonel and deputy head of the 91st Regiment, Lin Yongmeng, lieutenant colonel and battalion commander, Liu Shangwen, major and battalion commander, Chen Yunqiao, major and regimental adjutant, Li Youchen, major and battalion commander, Shen Zhenwen, captain and deputy battalion commander of the 92nd Regiment, Wen Tela, captain and battalion adjutant, Ni Xiafei, captain and battalion adjutant, and Li Yichang, captain and company commander, among 16 officers. The letter stated: "After the victory against Japan, we should have returned home to demobilize, but unexpectedly, under the deception and coercion of Chiang Kai-shek, we crossed the river to attack the Liberated Areas and the Eighth Route Army, causing the flames of civil war to spread across the land and our dear compatriots to suffer catastrophe. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have wives and daughters? Our conscience is not dead, and we are unwilling to use the guns and cannons of American imperialism to slaughter our own compatriots. We are determined to lay down our butcher knives and throw ourselves into the embrace of the people, and we have received the enthusiastic love and care of the elders and brothers in the Liberated Areas. Now that the fierce battle in Jinan has started again, we dare to ask you, our comrades-in-arms, to make a permanent plan for your own future and for the survival of the nation, and to learn from generals such as Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, and Wang Haiqing, to stage battlefield uprisings, to join hands closely with the Eighth Route Army, to oppose the civil war, to strive for peace, and to build an independent, democratic, and free new China."
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 15th] More than 400 Chiang's army soldiers who laid down their arms in the Taixing and Rugao battles held an anti-civil war accusation meeting in a certain place in central Jiangsu on the 28th of last month. Attendees included soldiers and wounded from the 28th Division, the 19th Division, and the 99th Division (now all renamed brigades). Liu Junting, a soldier of the 26th Division, said: "Brothers only get two meals a day, and three taels are deducted from 25 taels of grain, forcing everyone to work on an empty stomach; the officers not only eat from the fake roster but also deduct our salaries. 6,000 yuan was deducted in May, and the rubber shoe fee was also deducted to do business and get rich, forcing us to go to the front line to die. This time, when we came to northern Jiangsu, they lied to us, saying that we could go home after eliminating the 'bandits'. Now we know that we have been fooled." Another private said: "We are unwilling to fight the civil war. The officers lied to us, saying that the New Fourth Army are 'bandits' and that we would be skinned alive if we were caught. But we have been here for more than ten days, and the New Fourth Army treats us like brothers. Not only have we not been skinned alive, but our wounds have been healed." They cited many facts to prove that Chiang Kai-shek colluded with the American reactionaries and employed American troops to support the civil war. There were four American officers in the 99th Division, and American officers often went to speak when the 26th Division was in Nantong. They all said in unison: "Chiang Kai-shek is a dictator who gives sovereignty to foreigners and wants to be a puppet emperor. He is truly a traitor!"

　　晋南战役中放下武器之蒋军军官
    号召蒋军实行战场起义
    苏中放下武器蒋军举行反内战控诉
    【本报阳城讯】国民党第三十军增兵晋南后，战争形势复趋紧张。上月十三日，于闻喜之入掌战斗中放下武器之蒋军三十一师九一团九二团军官，顷发表告进攻晋南解放区国民党军将士书，号召实行战场起义，与八路军携手反对内战。签名者有九二团中校副团长梁藏伟，九一团中校副团长林永康、中校营长林勇猛、少校营长刘尚文、少校团附陈云桥、少校营长李佑辰，九二团上尉副营长沈震文、上尉营附温特拉、上尉营附倪霞飞、上尉连长李益昌等十六名军官。该书略称：“抗日胜利本应复员还乡，孰料又在蒋介石欺骗威迫之下渡河北犯解放区进攻八路军，以致内战火焰燃遍四野，亲爱同胞惨遭浩劫，谁无父母？谁无妻女？我等良心未泯，不愿拿上美帝国主义的枪炮残杀自己同胞。决心放下屠刀投到人民怀抱，倍受解放区父老兄弟热情抚爱。现今晋南恶战再起，敢请诸位袍泽为自己前途为国家民族存亡，做一永久打算，学习高树勋、潘朔端、王海清等将军，举行战场起义，与八路军亲密携手，反对内战，争取和平，建设独立民主自由新中国。”
    【新华社淮阴十五日电】在泰兴、如皋战役中，放下武器的蒋军一部四百余人，于上月二十八日在苏中某地举行反内战控诉大会，到会者包括廿八师、十九师、九十九师（现均改称旅）等部士兵与伤员。廿六师士兵刘俊廷说：“弟兄们每天两餐，二十五两粮就被克扣三两，叫大家饥着肚子作工事；当官的吃了空额还要扣发我们的薪饷，五月份被扣六千元，胶鞋费也被扣去做生意发财，迫着我们上火线送死。这次来苏北又欺骗我们说，消灭‘土匪’后可以回家。现在我们知道是上当了。”另一个上等兵说：“我们是不愿打内战的，长官欺骗我们说：新四军是‘土匪’，被捉去要抽筋剥皮。但我们到这里已经十几天了，新四军待我们像兄弟，不但没有被抽筋剥皮，相反的我们的伤口倒被医好了”。他们列举许多事实证明蒋介石勾结美国反动派，任用美军支持内战。九十九师内有美国军官四人，廿六师在南通时亦常有美军官前往讲话。他们异口同声地说：“蒋介石一人专制独裁，将主权交给外国人，一心想做儿皇帝，真是一个卖国贼”！
