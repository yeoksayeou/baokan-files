　　Yicheng Emancipated Peasants
    Launch Anti-Civil War Self-Defense Movement
    Defeating Chinese and Foreign Reactionary Attacks is the Real Emancipation
    [Our newspaper Yangcheng dispatch] The masses of peasants in Yicheng, after their emancipation, are currently launching an anti-civil war self-defense movement. More than twenty administrative villages have established self-defense groups combining war preparedness and anti-treachery measures, and are extensively carrying out a movement to confess to being a KMT spy. The Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on US military aid, are prolonging the civil war front, universally arousing the blazing fire of mass anger. The masses are all saying: "Yan is a branch, Chiang is the trunk, they cannot live without the old American root; we have only achieved a small emancipation now, and to achieve a great emancipation we must resist the Chinese and foreign reactionaries." The militiamen have all made up their minds to shed blood to defend the fruits of emancipation; they are not selling the coffins they obtained from the struggle to offset debts, generously saying: "Emancipation requires struggle, self-defense requires bloodshed, let's keep the coffins for our own use!" Self-defense groups (which are also wartime evacuation groups) in villages such as Fuche and Fandian have conducted war preparedness exercises, ensuring that when war comes, they will not encumber the militiamen, allowing the militiamen to concentrate on fighting on the front lines. The self-defense mobilization and confession movement, which began on July 2nd, started in villages such as Beiguan and Xiyan. The peasant association and activists are conducting mobilization door-to-door and in large gatherings. They put forward the idea that "without a bottom line for theives, it is difficult to move forward," and "We are not afraid of outside KMT spies, but only of local bad people." After mass discussion, a self-defense covenant was established, guaranteeing: not to do bad things, not to harbor bad people, not to contact bad people, and to pay attention to KMT spy activities. Then, people voluntarily joined together, mutually guaranteeing, and those with problems had to confess and repent before they could participate in the self-defense group. The Quántóu natural village established a self-defense group during war mobilization. One woman reported that her husband had been in contact with the traitor Chen Zǐwén in the past, had led Chen's troops to Quántóu to kill people, and persuaded her husband to confess. With the masses' forgiveness and leniency, he participated in the self-defense group. (Yi Shan)

　　翼城翻身农民
    开展反内战自卫运动
    打败中外反动派进攻才是大翻身
    【本报阳城讯】翼城翻身后的农民群众，近正开展反内战自卫运动。现有二十几个行政村建立了备战与防奸结合的自卫小组，并广泛开展着反特坦白运动。国民党反动派仗凭美国军火援助，拉长内战火线，普遍激起了群众愤怒的烈火。群众都这样讲：“阎是树枝，蒋是树干，他们离了美国老根就不能活；我们现在只是小翻身，想要大翻身还得把中国外国反动派抗下去。”民兵们都已下了决心，准备为保卫翻身果实而流血；他们从斗争中得的顶账的棺木，不卖了，慷慨地说：“翻身要斗争，自卫要流血，留着棺木给咱们自己用吧”！符册、樊店等村的自卫小组（也是战时的转移小组），已作了备战演习，做到战争到来时，不牵累民兵，使民兵能够集中到前线上去作战。七月二日开始的自卫动员与坦白运动，从北关、西阎等村作起。通过农会与积极分子，进行挨门挨户与大会的动员。提出“贼无底线，寸步难行”，“不怕外来特务，单怕本地坏人。”经群众讨论定出自卫公约，保证：不作坏事，不留坏人，不与坏人联系，注意特务活动。然后，自愿结合，互相保证，有问题的坦白悔过，才能参加自卫小组。泉头自然村在战争动员中建立自卫小组，一妇女检举他的丈夫过去与陈逆子文有联系，曾带领陈部来泉头杀过人，并劝他男人坦白了，在群众原谅宽大下参加了自卫小组。（移山）
