　　Taihang Donates to Relieve
    Disaster-Stricken People in Hebei, Shandong and Henan River Areas
    Kuomintang Detains Relief Supplies, Central News Agency Fabricates Rumors
    [This Newspaper's Report] The people of Taihang are indignant at the Kuomintang reactionaries for violating the Nanjing Agreement and delaying relief to the people along the old course of the Yellow River, and have voluntarily donated money to help their compatriots along the river in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Following the Taihang Third Middle School in Zuoquan, the people of Xiangyuan County have also launched a fundraising campaign. When villagers, schools, and reading groups in the first and third districts discussed this issue, the masses said, "We are one family in the liberated areas. If the reactionaries want to eliminate them, they also want to eliminate us. We cannot ignore them." The donation campaign immediately spread throughout the county. An old woman in a village in the morning said, "We are all people who have turned over and stood up. If they are in trouble, we must help them. I will donate a斗 (dǒu - a unit of dry measure, about 10 liters) of millet." Currently, in the first and third districts alone, more than 259,000 yuan and more than 5,500 jin of grain have been donated. Soon, the donations from the entire county will be collected and sent to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Relief Branch.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: On the 10th of this month, twenty-one civilian boats fully loaded with relief medicines, weighing 140 tons, dispatched by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), were detained by a crowd of so-called "Northern Jiangsu refugees" instigated by the Kuomintang, and were not allowed to pass.
    Heze, 30th: Our reporter recently made a special visit to Mr. Ma Chongmin, head of the general affairs group, and Mr. Li Zuyuan, head of the business group of the CRRRA office in Heze, regarding the Central News Agency's Xuzhou dispatch that 6,000 bags of relief flour stored in Heze by the CRRRA were looted by the Communist army. According to them: "The Henan branch transported 9,200 large bags and 169,516 small bags of flour to Heze. Except for 3,946 large bags and 129,510 small bags that have been issued as wages for river management workers, all the rest are stored in the warehouse." Mr. Ma and Mr. Li solemnly told the reporter: "We can completely confirm that there was no looting incident, and this office has never reported such a thing to the branch." It should be noted that the Kuomintang authorities have repeatedly delayed the supply guaranteed in the Nanjing Agreement. For the engineering wages alone, the liberated area's first phase of the project has consumed 8,800 tons, while the Kuomintang side has only transported 4,145 tons, less than 50%. The gap is even greater for other materials and construction funds. The Central News Agency is fabricating rumors out of thin air, clearly attempting to cover up its crime of reneging on the Nanjing Agreement and hindering river management.

　　太行捐款救济
    冀鲁豫河道灾胞
    国民党扣留救资中央社凭空造谣
    【本报讯】太行人民对国民党反动派破坏南京协议迟不救济黄河故道沿岸人民咸表愤慨，并纷纷自动捐款，救济冀鲁豫沿河同胞。继左权太行第三中学之后，襄垣全县人民亦展开募捐运动。在一、三两区各村民校读报讨论这一问题时，群众说：“咱解放区是一家，反动派要消灭他们，也就是要消灭我们，咱不能不管”。捐募运动立即普及全县。上午村一个老太太说：“咱们都是翻了身的人，他们遇了难，咱们要招呼，咱捐一斗小米”。现仅一三两区，已捐款二十五万九千余元，粮食五千五百余斤，不日即将会集全县捐款，汇往冀鲁豫救济分会。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】行总本月十日下午，派往淮阴满载救济药品之民船二十一只，重一百四十吨，为国民党嗾使之所谓“苏北难民”聚众扣留，不予放行。
    【荷泽三十日电】本社记者顷特就中央社徐州电所谓行总存荷泽救济面粉被共军抢去六千袋一事，往访行总驻荷办事处总务组长马重民、业务组长李祖原二先生，据称：“河南分署运抵荷泽面粉九千二百大袋、十六万九千五百一十六小袋，除已发出治河工粮三千九百四十六大袋、十二万九千五百一十小袋外，余均全数存仓。”马李二先生郑重告记者：“我们完全可以证实绝无所谓抢劫事件发生，且本处亦从未向分署作过此类报告”。按国民党当局对南京协议中所保证之供给一再拖延，仅工粮一项，解放区第一期工程已耗去八千八百吨，而国民党方面仅运来四千一百四十五吨，不及百分之五十，他如器材工款等相差更甚，中央社凭空捏造谣言，显图掩饰其背弃南京协议，阻碍治河之罪行。
