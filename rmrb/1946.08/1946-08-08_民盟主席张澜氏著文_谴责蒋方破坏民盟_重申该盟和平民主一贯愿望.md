Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Chongqing Dispatch: Mr. Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, authored an article in Chengdu on July 21st, clarifying the League's position and condemning the Kuomintang authorities' destructive activities against the League. Mr. Zhang stated first: "From the beginning, the Democratic League has advocated that China needs democracy, needs peaceful unification, and does not want the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to engage in civil war. Advocating democracy naturally requires the Kuomintang to abandon one-party dictatorship and personal autocracy. Because advocating peaceful unification naturally requires both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to cease military conflict and resolve disputed issues through political consultation. Coincidentally, the Communist Party's demands are the same as the Democratic League's, also opposing one-party dictatorship, demanding that all parties establish a coalition government, and demanding a long-term truce to resolve military and political issues through consultation, which is inherently extremely correct. The Kuomintang people do not realize their mistakes, but instead hate the Democratic League as the Communist Party's tail. The Kuomintang authorities, insisting that one-party dictatorship is a right they cannot lose, and the pro-war faction, insisting on obtaining American aid to attempt to eliminate the Communist Party by force in the short term, therefore oppose democracy, oppose peace, oppose the Communist Party, and always want to undermine the Democratic League and strike at the Democratic League."

Mr. Zhang continued: "Since last September, the Democratic League has been subjected to either enticement for division or threats for suppression. For example, a certain government official told Mr. Huang Renzi that the government was helping a certain party with tens of millions of yuan in funding, allowing it to expand its membership, in order to encourage Mr. Huang Renzi, but Huang was unmoved. Also, a certain government official advised Mr. Zhang Junli, saying: The government will fully assist and specialize in helping a certain party group; Mr. Junli was also unmoved. These are examples of using enticement to try to divide the Democratic League. Furthermore, during the Political Consultative Conference, military police and secret agents in the capital suddenly went to search Mr. Renzi's bedroom, and at the celebration of the Political Consultative Conference at Jiaochangkou, secret agents and hooligans went to beat Mr. Li Gongpu and others. At the end of last month, Mr. Zhang Zhi＠'s residence here was placed under surveillance by secret agents, who claimed that once the punitive order was issued, the heterodox parties would be completely cleared away, giving the Democratic League a major blow. Especially in the current two months, secret agents have successively murdered comrades Wang Ren and Li Furen (Note: Mr. Li has been rescued and escaped danger) in Xi'an. This month, Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo in Kunming were also successively assassinated by secret agents. These are all examples of using threats to suppress the Democratic League."

Finally, Mr. Zhang solemnly stated: "Standing in the position of the Democratic League, we are still firmly neutral towards the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; standing in the position of the state, we must clearly distinguish right from wrong in the actions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. No matter how they entice or threaten, in order to realize the aspirations of the Republic of China for democracy, unity, peaceful unification, we only adhere to eight characters: "persevere and be indomitable!"

　　民盟主席张澜氏著文
    谴责蒋方破坏民盟
    重申该盟和平民主一贯愿望
    【新华社延安五日电】渝讯：中国民主同盟主席张澜氏七月二十一日在蓉著文阐明民盟立场，并谴责国民党当局对民盟的破坏活动。张氏首称：“民盟自始即主张中国需要民主，需要和平统一，不愿国共两党发生内战。主张民主，当然要求国民党放弃一党专政和个人独裁。因为主张和平统一，当然要求国民党、共产党双方停止军事冲突，以政治协商来解决所争执的问题。恰恰共产党的要求与民盟主张一样，也反对一党专政，要求各党派成立联合政府，并要求长期停战，用协商来解决军事政治各问题，这本是极正确的。国民党人不自觉悟其非，反恨民盟是共产党尾巴。国民党当权派既坚持一党专政为他们不可损失的权利，主战派坚持获得美国援助，企图在短期内以武力消灭共产党，于是反民主反和平反共产党，并总想破坏民盟，打击民盟。”张氏继称：“从去年九月以来，对于民盟不是用利诱来分化，便是用威胁来打击。例如政府某要人告黄任之先生称：政府帮助某党经费数千万元，任它扩大其党员，以之鼓励黄任之先生，而黄不为所动。又政府某某要人劝张君励先生谓：政府一切协助，专以帮助某党团；君励先生亦不为之动。这是用利诱以图分化民盟的事证。又如在政协会议期中，陪都军警特务突去搜查任之先生的卧室，较场口庆祝政协会上，特务流氓又去打李公朴先生等。前月底，此间张志＠先生住宅之被特务监视，并称一俟讨伐令下，即荡然清除异党，予民盟以重大打击。尤其是目前两月，特务已在西安前后杀害了本盟同志王任、李敷仁（按：李氏已获救脱险）。本月昆明李公朴、闻一多两先生亦相继被特务暗杀，这都是用威胁打击民盟的事证。”最后张氏严正表示：“我们站在民盟立场，对于国共两党仍然是确定中立；站在国家立场，对于国共两党的行动，即必须明辩是非。任他如何利诱，如何威胁，我们为了中华民国的民主团结和平统一之志能实现，只坚守八个字：“再接再厉，不屈不挠”！
