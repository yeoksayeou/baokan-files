Criticism and Suggestions

　　Some Opinions for the Post Office
    Recently, readers and subscribers from various places have been writing to inquire about not receiving the books and periodicals they ordered (or receiving them very late). Sometimes we receive five or six such letters a day, which puts us in a very embarrassing position and subjects us to criticism. We would like to explain our distribution procedures: When we distribute our magazines, letters, etc., we check each household carefully to ensure accuracy, then register them in a delivery book and send them to the post office, where the post office stamps them as proof. However, the result is that they are not delivered to the readers. For example, a volume of books that we sent to the Taihang Xinhua Daily Issuance Section on July 22nd, following the same procedure, had not been received by the newspaper office by August 16th. The distance is only 70 *li* (approximately 35 kilometers), and it still hasn't been received after 26 or 27 days. Other readers, such as the Military Region's Civil Affairs Department, the Production Department, Li Cheng West Well High School, Zuoquan Second High School, etc., have sent many letters inquiring about things we sent out, which have not been received for two or three months. We have checked and rechecked, and our accounts and delivery books match perfectly. We don't know why things are always missing. We have raised this issue with the local post office countless times, but there is no solution. They say, "Ordinary mail cannot be traced, and if it's lost, it's just lost." We said, "In the future, we will send everything by registered mail." They said, "That's even worse, there would be hundreds of registered items every day." There is really no solution, so we have to use ordinary mail. "What happens if it gets lost?" The answer is, "There's nothing we can do."
    Readers pay money and don't see the books, which we feel is really unfair. We send things out (books, letters, magazines), and readers don't receive them, and we have to pay a lot of compensation. Many people who want to read books are afraid to buy them from us. Originally, they planned to come here to buy them to get a preferential price and read them earlier. But because of transportation problems, they read them late or not at all, which makes some readers dissatisfied and even complain, saying, "I'm not going to study anymore! ......" We feel that we cannot continue like this in the long term! We sincerely hope that the responsible comrades of the post office will thoroughly inspect post offices at all levels and strive for improvement to meet the expectations of the public. Considering the work and our responsibility to the people, we frankly put forward these opinions and suggestions, hoping to see improvements soon!

### 向邮局提一点意见

专栏：批评与建议

　　向邮局提一点意见
    近来各地读者、订户纷纷来信询问，说收不到订购的书籍刊物（或收到的很晚），有时一天收到五六封这样的信，对我们提出很难堪的意见和批评。现将我们发行手续说明：我们的杂志、书信等件，向外发行，每次都是一户一户的查对无误后，登记送文簿送到邮局，由邮局盖章为证，但结果未能送到读者手里。如七月二十二日我们往太行新华日报发行科赠送的书一卷，也是经过同样手续，到八月十六日报馆还没收到，距离只有七十里路，二十六七天还没有收到。其他如军区民运部、生产部，黎城西井高校，左权二高……等许多读者来信询问，我们寄出去的东西，都是二三个月都不能收到。我们左查右查，我们的账和送文簿完全相对，不知为甚总是收不到，向当地邮局提过不知有多少次也没办法，说是“平件就不能查，丢掉也只好丢掉”，我们说“今后都用挂号寄吧”，他们说“那更不行，每天能有几百个挂号”，实在没办法，只好平件。“丢了怎办”？答说“没办法”。
    读者拿上钱看不到书，我们觉着实在有点过不去，我们发出去的东西（书信杂志），读者收不到，我们赔的也不太少了。有好多人想要看书也不敢向我们买，本来打算来我们这里买想优待点，看的早点。但因交通关系看的晚、看不到，使一部分读者不满，甚至发牢骚说：“不学习了！………”我们觉得实在不能再这样长期下去！我们诚恳的希望邮局负责同志，对各级邮局切实检查，力求改进，以符众望。从工作着想，从对人民负责着想，我们率直的提出这些意见与建议，希望很快能看到改进！
