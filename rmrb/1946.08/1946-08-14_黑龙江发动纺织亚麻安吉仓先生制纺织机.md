Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, August 11th: The Heilongjiang Provincial Democratic Government has recently mobilized the people to spin flax yarn for weaving cloth in order to solve the clothing problem. North of the Songhua River does not grow cotton, and coupled with the exploitation by the enemy and puppets for fourteen years, the vast majority of people are scantily clad. Baiquan, Hailun, Keshan, Qingcheng and other counties in the province are flax producing areas, with Keshan being the most well-known. Currently, the provincial democratic government, in addition to taking Kedong as a demonstration area and providing substantial assistance and organization for the people to spin flax, has specially appointed Mr. An Jicang, who has worked in flax factories for twelve years and is now an administrative committee member of the provincial government, to engage in research on flax spinning machines. Mr. An comes from a working-class background, has rich experience, and is very enthusiastic about this matter. He recently went to Hailun and other places to investigate various machines, working and living with the workers there, and then began to cast molds and manufacture based on the machine drawings he had collected over the years. He personally melted iron and turned sand to manufacture the more than 5,000 parts needed, sometimes eating only one meal a day. After several months of effort, a prototype of a fifteen-head flax spinning machine has emerged. Mr. An is now further researching and refining the machine with joy, in order to further improve the machine and make it into a forty-head flax spinning machine. It is reported that after this type of machine is manufactured, each machine can spin 720 jin of flax yarn per day, which will be of great benefit to the development of the flax textile industry in the province.

　　黑龙江发动纺织亚麻安吉仓先生制纺织机
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十一日电】黑龙江省民主政府，近发动人民用亚麻纺线织布解决穿衣问题。因松花江以北不长棉花，加以十四年来敌伪盘剥，广大人民衣不掩体。而该省之拜泉、海伦、克山、庆城等县均为亚麻产地，并以克山为著。现该省民主政府，除将以克东为示范区，大量帮助与组织人民纺织亚麻外，并特约曾在亚麻工厂工作十二年现为省府行政委员之安吉仓先生，从事亚麻纺织机之研究。安先生系工人出身，经验丰富，对此事甚为热心。近赴海伦等地考查各种机械，在那里亲自上班作工和工友共起居，然后参考自己多年所收藏之机器图样开始铸模制造。所需五千多零件他亲自融铁翻沙制造，有时一天只吃一顿饭。经数月努力，一部十五个头的亚麻纺织机的雏型已经出现。现安先生正以欢快的心情进一步研究和修整，以使机器更加改进而能制成四十个头的亚麻纺织机。据悉：此种机器制成后，每架机器日可纺七百二十斤麻线，对全省亚麻纺织业之开展，将有重大利益。
