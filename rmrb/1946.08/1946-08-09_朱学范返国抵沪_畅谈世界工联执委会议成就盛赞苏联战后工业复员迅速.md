　　Zhu Xuefan Returns to Shanghai
    Talks About the Achievements of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee Meeting, Praises the Rapid Post-War Industrial Recovery of the Soviet Union
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th】According to the Shanghai Zhonghua Times: Zhu Xuefan, who attended the Moscow World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee meeting, returned to the country and arrived in Shanghai on the 20th of last month. It is said that to improve the living conditions of Chinese workers, the first priority is to stabilize domestic order. It was also stated that the Chinese representatives were warmly received in Moscow, and the Soviet Union and other participating countries attached importance to the solidarity of the Chinese workers. This meeting has indeed further enhanced the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. The World Federation of Trade Unions has unanimously resolved to maintain world peace, promote prosperity, improve the living standards of workers, demand participation in United Nations conferences, oppose the Franco regime in Spain, eliminate the remaining forces of Fascism, support colonial workers, fight for freedom of organization for workers worldwide, and organize a six-member delegation to visit Japan and make a stop in China. When talking about his impressions of industry, Zhu praised the development of Soviet industry and the rapid post-war industrial recovery; at present, there is no trade deficit. The Sunkist oranges seen in the Shanghai market are almost nowhere to be found in Moscow. He also said that the trend of the Soviet Union's fourth five-year plan will certainly exceed a certain standard.
