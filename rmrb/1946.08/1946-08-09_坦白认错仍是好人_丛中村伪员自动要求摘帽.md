Confessing Mistakes Franky Still Makes You a Good Person
Congcun Village Puppet Personnel Voluntarily Request Removal of the Label
[This newspaper, Handan News] Under the leadership and education of the government, former puppet army personnel in Congcun Village have confessed their mistakes to the Farmers' Association one after another, and have recently participated in the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. There were 160 puppet army members in the village in the past (out of just over 500 households in the entire village). Except for a very few who were running dogs of traitors and local bullies, who had acted tyrannically and oppressed the masses, the majority were poor peasants who were oppressed and exploited. They were forced to become puppet soldiers due to the enemy's and puppets' "selling soldiers," dispatching soldiers, and conscripting soldiers. Because these people had worn the shameful hat of "puppet soldier," the masses hated them when they were mentioned. Therefore, all of them were excluded from the mass emancipation movement. Recently, when the Farmers' Association was rectified in the village and a new struggle was brewing, they confessed to the Farmers' Association and requested to participate in the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. At the grievance-airing meeting for puppet army personnel, Jiang Tianguang said sadly: "I sold myself as a soldier three times, all because there was nothing to eat. My father said: 'It's better to sell yourself as a soldier so everyone can find a way to survive than to starve to death together at home.' But the last time the selling price was 30,000 yuan, the Bao chief kept delaying payment.” Zhao Bangchen said sadly: "The township head Zhao Zhenxiang, Bao chief Wang Qin, etc., forced me to pay grain. Because I couldn't afford it, they punched and kicked my father. I had no choice but to become a puppet soldier to pay off the debt." Li Shangzhi tearfully angrily said that his family had no house or land, and could not stand the extortion of traitors, so he became a puppet soldier. Because he heard that the Eighth Route Army worked for the poor, he contacted the Eighth Route Army staff. Later, he was discovered by the company commander, who beat him to a bloody pulp. These complaints reminded everyone of the sad things that happened in the past when they were bullied by traitors and local bullies at home; forced to become puppet soldiers; and bullied by Japanese devils and puppet officials. They realized that they were also oppressed and exploited people, and only by airing grievances with the masses and overthrowing traitors and local bullies could they wash away the bad name of "puppet soldier" and be emancipated. The masses also felt that these were their own class brothers who should be united, "take off their hats" and be emancipated together. Those who had done some bad things felt even more sorry for the masses and voluntarily confessed their mistakes. Now, more than 50 people have been approved to join the Farmers' Association, and Jiang Tianguang has been elected as the leader of the Farmers' Association group. A number of activists have also emerged in the recent anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. The confession movement of puppet army personnel in the village is now developing along with the anti-traitor movement. (Dong Qi, Xu Shu)

　　坦白认错仍是好人
    丛中村伪员自动要求摘帽
    【本报邯郸讯】丛中村过去的伪军人员，在政府领导教育下，都先后向农会坦白认错，最近纷纷参加反奸诉苦运动。该村过去当伪军的有一百六十名（全村只五百多户），除极少数为汉奸、恶霸地主的走狗，曾横行霸道欺压群众外，大多数均系被压迫被剥削的贫苦农民，因敌伪“卖兵”、派兵、抓兵被迫当了伪军。这些人由于曾戴过这个耻辱的伪军帽子，群众提起“伪军”就痛恨，因此全部被抛在群众翻身运动以外。最近在该村整顿农会，酝酿新的斗争时，都纷纷向农会坦白要求参加反奸诉苦运动。在伪军人员诉苦会上姜田光悲痛地说：“我卖会过三回兵，都因为没啥吃，俺爹说：在家里一齐饿死，不如你“卖兵”大家找个活路，可是最后一次卖价三万元，保长却始终拖延未给”。赵邦辰伤心地说：“乡长赵振祥、保长王钦等到我家迫粮款，因为拿不起，就拳打脚踢把俺爹捧了一顿，万分无奈我才顶款去当了伪军。”李尚志眼里含着热泪愤慨地诉说他家里房无一间地无一垅，摆小摊受不了汉奸们勒索才当了伪军，因听说八路军是给穷人办事的，所以和八路的工作员有了联系。后被中队长发觉，打得自己血肉模糊死去活来。这些诉说使大家都想起了过去在家受汉奸、恶霸们的欺负；被迫当了伪军，又受日本鬼子和伪官欺负的伤心事，认识了自己也是被压迫被剥削的人，只有和群众一起伸冤诉苦，斗垮汉奸、恶霸地主才能洗刷掉“伪军”的臭名，才能翻身。群众也感到这都是自己的阶级弟兄应团结他们，“摘下帽子”共同翻身。个别作过些坏事的，也就更加感到对不起群众自动坦白认错。现在已有五十几人被批准加入了农会，姜田光被选为农会小组长，在最近的反奸诉苦中也涌现出一批积极分子。现该村伪军人员的坦白运动正随着反奸运动在开展中。（董奇、徐树）
