　　French Communist Party Commands Great Influence
　　Peasants Also Regard Thorez as Savior
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] According to the American magazine *Time*, the French Communist Party is one of the most effective political organizations in history. Although only one in eight union members is a communist, the Communist Party leads thirty of the forty industrial unions in France. Among them are the three largest unions: the Steelworkers' Union (over 890,000 members), the Construction Workers' Union (over 510,000 members), and the Railway Workers' Union (over 380,000 members). Six out of the three members of the French General Confederation of Labour are communists, and there are several sympathizers. The magazine also stated that the strength of the French Communist Party is not limited to trade unions and major cities, but extends throughout the country. In ninety-eight of the ninety-nine provinces in France (number missing), one district also has twenty-four branches. In 1936, that district only had two hundred party members, but last October it had more than one thousand. An even more shining example of the French Communist Party's organizational ability is Guéret and around Albi in southwestern France. A year ago, the peasants in and near this area did not welcome the Communist Party very much, but now they regard the French Communist Party leader Thorez as a savior. Note: The French Communist Party is currently one of the three major ruling parties in France, the fourth largest party in parliament, with more than five million votes, and currently has 1.2 million members.

　　法共声势浩大
　　农民亦认多列士为救星
    【新华社延安二十日电】据美国时代杂志称：法国共产党是历史上最有效力的政治组织之一。虽然八个工会会员中仅有一个是共产党员，但在法国四十个产业工会中有三十个是在共产党领导之下。其中有三个最大的工会：钢铁工人工会（会员八十九万余人），建筑工人工会（会员五十一万余人）及铁路工人工会（会员三十八万余人）。在法国总工会三个委员中有六个是共产党员，并有几个同情分子。该杂志并称：法共会力量不限于职工会与大都抓市，其力量能及于全国。在法国九十八、九省中（中缺数字），一个区也有二十四个支部，一九三六年该区仅有二百党员，去年十月则有一千余人。法共组织能力更光辉的例子是法国西南部的古列阿尔比，一年前该地及其附近农民对共产党均不甚欢迎，今则认法共领袖多列士为救星。按：法国为目前法国三大执政党之一，议会中第四大党，拥有五百万以上的选票，今有党员一百二十万人。
