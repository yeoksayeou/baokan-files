　　Latin American Countries
    Oppose Pan-American Military Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th] According to a TASS dispatch from New York on August 25th: Democratic public opinion in the United States and Latin American countries has risen in opposition to Truman's Pan-American military cooperation plan. American radio commentator Steele stated: Truman's plan damages the United States' prestige within the Security Council. With the right to supply weapons and arbitrarily recall them, the American President will become the sole arbiter of the fate of South American governments, supporting dictators and overthrowing regimes he dislikes. Several American public organizations have denounced this plan as "a threat to the security of the Western Hemisphere and the world." Democratic newspapers, trade unions, and many political leaders in South American countries have also pointed out: "The passage of this proposal will create a serious threat to the sovereignty of these countries."

　　拉丁美洲各国
    反对泛美军事计划
    【新华社延安二十七日电】据塔斯社纽约二十五日电称：美国及拉丁美洲各国民主舆论，纷起反对杜鲁门之泛美军事合作计划。美广播评论员斯蒂尔称：杜鲁门的计划损害了美国在安理会内的威信，美总统在享受供给武器及可以任意收回武器权利之下，将可变成南美各国政府命运的唯一裁判人，支持独裁者和推翻他不喜欢的政权。美若干公共团体斥责此计划“为对西半球及世界安全的威胁”。南美各国的民主报纸、职工会、许多政治领袖，同时指出：“这一建议的通过，将造成对这些国家主权的严重威胁。”
