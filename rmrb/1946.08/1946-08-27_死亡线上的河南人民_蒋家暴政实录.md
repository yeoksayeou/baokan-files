Henan People on the Brink of Death
    -- A True Record of Chiang Kai-shek's Tyranny
    Xiao Qin

"The four disasters of Henan: floods, droughts, locusts, and Tang Enbo [a Nationalist general notorious for his harsh conscription policies]." Especially in the summer of 1938 when Xuzhou fell, the Nationalist authorities disregarded the life and death of the people and breached the Yellow River. A full eight counties, two million people suffered from the flood disaster. In the years after the flood, they encountered two more severe droughts, coupled with exorbitant taxes, miscellaneous levies, conscription, corvée labor, extortion, and apportionment. Some families even committed suicide, some exchanged their sons for grain, and even tree bark, grass roots, mud, and bird droppings were used as food. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, except for the areas liberated by the Communist Eighth Route Army, the disasters faced by the people of Henan increased day by day.

Last August, after the enemy announced their surrender, people breathed a sigh of relief, their eyes radiating with comfort; everyone rejoiced at the victory of the motherland and prayed for a stable life after the war.

But what did victory bring to the people of Henan? It brought the gathering of large armies, the on-the-spot requisition of military grain, and the fact that those who had fled could not make a living upon their return, and had to live like primitive people on a piece of barren land. Still others engaged in robbery, extortion, rape, and humiliation. Under the oppression of heavy burdens, people left their homes. Even the China Times published in Kaifeng said: "After the victory, millions of troops could not be demobilized immediately, and their military discipline was not up to par. The requisition of military grain was as urgent as a shooting star, with endless darkness due to embezzlement. The harvest of the farmers was completely collected, and the blood of the farmers was drained, yet it was still not enough to supply them. In the past, people's lives depended on the land, but now the land taxes are forcing people away." This is a very good portrayal.

"The donations are too high, people can't live, young people have all run away to other places, we old people are just waiting to die." This is the indignant remark of an old gentleman from Jixian County, but it is also the lament of the entire county. According to the materials of the county's grain section alone: public grain from October last year to March this year totaled 1.5 million jin, and military grain was countless. From August to December last year, it totaled 4 million jin. This year, the 30th Army borrowed 560,000 jin of military grain, the Three Route Columns borrowed 200,000 jin of grain, and 540,000 jin of grain were stockpiled for military use, totaling 7 million jin. In addition to these, which were requisitioned by the Nationalist County Government, there were many that the army directly demanded from the Baojia [local administrative units]. This number was even greater than the former. From the victory last year to May this year, the total amount of grain produced by the people in the Nationalist-controlled area of Jixian County was more than 15 million jin. With a population of 100,000, regardless of men, women, old or young, rich or poor, on average, each person had to bear 150 jin of grain. That's not all. In addition to grain, 1.8 million jin of firewood had to be sent every day, and recently 160 blockhouses had to be repaired, each costing 30,000 yuan, which adds up to an expenditure of 4.8 million yuan. Plus the "office personnel" profiting from it, the people's blood and sweat were squeezed dry.

If Jixian County was like this, other places were the same. Xiuwu County was a severely affected area. Not counting other burdens, the clothes and socks forcibly demanded by the garrison alone were worth 12.9 million yuan. The entire county has 38 Bao, and one Bao had to pay 1 million yuan. Shi Hengtian of Hongmiao Jincun Village in Huixian County had 120 mu of land. In normal years, he could only harvest 80 shi in two seasons, but from November last year to March this year, he paid 84 shi of grain.

The situation in the cities is also difficult to be optimistic about: In Anyang City, a small cigarette shop with a capital of only 100,000 yuan paid 5,000 yuan in Xiaofu Yang [a local currency], 10,000 yuan in Bao fees, and 5,000 yuan in cigarette monopoly fees from January to June. Each Ding Yang [another local currency] cost 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. In addition, the extortion of lower-level personnel, as well as the quite considerable amount of taxes and fees for house numbers, household registration, electricity, ash, and coal. What threatens businessmen the most is the state capitalist monopoly of the market, manipulation of materials, and runaway inflation, which makes all businesses, large and small, precarious and unsustainable. According to a survey: In the past six months, more than 200 flower cloth and sundry goods stores have closed, accounting for 20%; more than 200 have reduced their business and merged stores, and the number of seated merchants changing to itinerant merchants, and itinerant merchants changing to peddlers is even greater.

Hearing that relief supplies were to be distributed, everyone waited anxiously, like expecting clouds in a severe drought. But things often turned out contrary to people's expectations. When the relief supplies were distributed, those who were truly without food and clothing still wore sad faces and did not get anything. Who did the supplies relieve? On May 4th, the Third Relief Group of the Anyang General Branch of the Henan Branch answered this question: According to the investigation, after the refugees in Lin County received flour, County Chief Cheng Wanbao sent people to take back half a bag from each household, saying it was to offset the military grain for the local militia. When the county official Zhang Wei registered refugees, he extorted registration fees of hundreds or thousands of yuan from each person, and some paid several thousand. With more money, they could fabricate household registration or inflate the population. That's not all. When Cheng Wanbao distributed flour, he temporarily hired many people to impersonate refugees, and steadily put the relief supplies into his own pockets. In the 123 households of refugees in Lin County, a reporter made a statistic: 20% were civil servants, 40% were fabricated households, and 30% were wealthy merchants. What is even more bizarre is that some county governments actually disguised their militia soldiers as refugees and drove dozens of large carts to receive relief flour in a grand manner. An adjutant of a certain special commissioner's office was also registered in the refugee list, and the county party secretary's old father and the county chief's younger brother were also listed in the refugee team to receive relief grain, so the common people said that the Nationalist Party's so-called relief was actually "relieving themselves." The refugees can only quench their thirst with plums.

A folk rhyme called "The County Chief's World" can quite reflect the general licentiousness and shamelessness of the bureaucratic group and the so-called "officialdom." It is now recorded below:

    Before taking office, poor heaven and earth.
    Upon taking office, happy heaven and earth.
    After taking office, flowers, wine, and land.
    Bragging, talking about heaven and earth.
    Handling affairs, deceiving heaven and earth.
    Losing temper, cursing heaven and earth.
    Demanding bribes, concealing heaven and earth.
    Treating the people, fierce heaven and earth.
    Arousing public anger, crying heaven and earth.
    Asking you to leave, thanking heaven and earth.

From the inquiries of the Henan Provincial Council in April and May, we can also see what those gentlemen who call themselves "parents of the people" are doing, and how the upper and lower levels are colluding and protecting each other. At the meeting on April 30, Councilor Guo Haichang said: "Many county chiefs have been dismissed for corruption with evidence, or escorted to the province because of accusations, but once they are escorted to the province, they disappear. For example, the former County Chief Zhang of Huojia County and the secretary of the Fourth District Commissioner's Office were both escorted here, but where are they now?..." Councilor Shen Huanan said: "The former County Chief of Guangshan County was derelict in his duties during the occupation and was dismissed for investigation, but I don't know if it was really investigated. Now he has been appointed as the County Chief of Shangqiu, and it is a large county." Councilor Zhang ×× said: "The handover of county chiefs is not clear, and the former affects the latter. How can this be tolerated! The former County Chief Pang of Xiasheng County left his post without authorization and withdrew hundreds of thousands of yuan from the field grain office. Now his whereabouts are unknown, and no one is asking about it." Due to unclear officialdom and mutual connivance and protection, drugs are also rampant. Councilor Miao proposed: "Township chiefs smoke opium, the section chiefs of the county government smoke opium, and even the anti-smoking commissioners sent by the provincial government smoke opium. Where did these drugs come from? Are they smuggled by merchants? Are township chiefs protecting them? Are the public security bureau chiefs protecting them? The national army is better?" Bai Zongde continued: "Drugs are rampant throughout the province. They come from the hands of Koreans in Kaifeng. Most Koreans are related to important people in the provincial capital." Another councilor proposed the buying and selling of township chief positions in various counties. It is said that poor townships cost 200,000 yuan, and wealthy townships cost more than 2 million yuan. These speeches are naturally not enough to expose even one-thousandth of the Nationalist Party's officialdom. But it can help us understand why, after the victory, the people in the Nationalist-controlled areas still live in unbelievably painful times.

Someone with the pen name Bitter Water wrote a poem entitled "On the Line of Hunger," mainly describing the tragic situation of the people of Henan under the rule of the Nationalist Party after the victory. It is copied below as the ending of this article!

    Floods, droughts, locusts,
    Exorbitant taxes, miscellaneous levies, military service,
    Suffering from hunger.
    Under the enemy's bayonet,
    This is not the human world;
    This is the life of hell!
    Now,
    The rivers and mountains have been recovered,
    Prices should fall,
    Burdens should be reduced,
    People's livelihood should be stabilized,
    Who knew?!
    Grain prices are as before. (In fact, grain has risen forty to fifty times since the counter-offensive)
    Everything is high!
    Who knew?!
    Demanding money and grain,
    Apportionment is still as usual! (In fact, it is more than "as usual"!)
    Building forts and grabbing laborers,
    Urban and rural areas suffer disasters,
    "The Zhus' [referring to the wealthy] wine and meat stink,
    There are bones of the dead from hunger on the road,
    The old and weak turn to ditches,
    The strong run to all directions."
    Ask the sky,
    Where is our way of life?

　　死亡线上的河南人民
    ——蒋家暴政实录
    晓  琹
    “河南四灾，水旱蝗汤”。尤其在三八年夏天徐州失守的时候，国民党当局不顾人民的死活，把黄河决了口，整整八个县，二百万人民遭受到黄水的灾害，大水后几年，又遇到两次严重的旱灾，加上苛捐、杂税、兵役、差务、勒索、摊派，有的竟全家自杀，有的拿自己的儿子换粮食，连树皮、草根、泥土、鸟粪都作了食品。抗战八年中，除了共产党八路军解放的地区外，河南人民的灾难是与日俱增的。
    去年八月，敌人宣布投降后，人们喘了口气，眼睛里放射着欣慰的光芒；大家都庆幸着祖国的胜利，祈求着战后安定的生活。
    但是，胜利带给河南人民的是什么呢？是大军云集，是军粮就地征购，是流亡出去的人回来没法过日子，只好在一片荒土上，渡着原始人的生活，而另一些人则在抢窃、勒索、奸淫、辱侮，重重负担的威迫下，离开家园，连开封出版的中国时报也这样说：“胜利后百万大军不能立即复员，且军纪不成体统，征军粮，急如星火，辗转中饱，黑暗无穷，缴尽了农民收获，抽干了农民血液，尚不足供应。过去是人民生活赖土地，现在是土地征课逼走人民”。这正是很好的写真。

    “捐项太大了，人都不能活了，青年人都跑到外边去啦，我们年老的只有等着死”。这是汲县某老先生的忿慨之词，然而这也是全县人民的哀语。仅据该县粮食科的材料：公粮从去年十月到今年三月共一百五十万斤，军粮更不计其数，去年八月到十二月一共四百万斤，今年三十军借军粮五十六万斤，三路纵队借粮二十万斤，屯积兵粮五十四万斤，共七百万斤，除掉这些经国民党县府征借的，还有许多是军队直接向保甲要的，这个数字较前者还要多，从去年胜利到今年五月，汲县国民党区人民所出粮食总数在一千五百万斤以上，人口以十万计算，无论男女老幼，无论贫富平均起来，每人要负担一百五十斤粮。这还不算，粮食之外，每天要送一百八十万斤柴火，最近又要修碉堡一百六十个，每座三万元计算，合起来就是四百八十万的支出，加上“办公人员”的从中渔饱，老百姓的血汗也就榨得可以了。
    汲县如此，别的地方也是一样，修武是灾情很严重的地区，别的负担不算，只驻军强索的衣服鞋袜，即价值一千二百九十万元。全县三十八保，一保就出一百万。辉县红庙靳村史恒田有地一百二十亩，平常年景，一年两季才能收入八十石，而从去年十一月到今年三月即出粮食八十四石。
    城市里的情况，也使人难于乐观：安阳城里，一个资本仅十万元的小卷烟铺，一月到六月，即出小夫洋五千，保款一万，卷专费五千，每份丁洋又是二、三万，再加上下层人员的勒索，以及门牌、户口、电灯、灰渣、煤炭等捐税数目字就相当可观。尤其给商人威胁最大的，是官僚资本的垄断市场，操纵物资，通货恶性膨胀，于是弄得大小买卖都是摇摇欲坠，不可终日。现据调查：半年来花布杂货店关门的有二百多家，占百分之二十；缩小营业，兼并门面的二百多家，而坐贾改为行商，行商改为小贩的为数尤多。

    听说要发救济物资，大家像大旱望云雨，眼巴巴的等待着，但是事情往往出乎人的意料之外，救济品发下了，真正衣食无着的人却依然哭丧着脸，没有得到一点东西，物资救济谁了？五月四日，安阳行总豫分署急赈三组解答了这个问题：据调查，林县难民领回面粉后，县长程万宝又派人每户追回半袋，说是要抵地方团队的军粮。该县干事张伟登记难民时，每人勒索登记费百元或千元，也有缴好几千的，钱多了就可以捏报户口或多报人口。这还不算，程万宝在分配面粉时，临时顾了好多人冒名顶替，把救济物资稳稳当当入了自己私囊。林县难民一二三户中，某报记者给做了个统计：百分之二十是公务员，百分之四十是捏造户口，百分之三十是殷商富户，里边有十几户是拥有妻妾的。更离奇的是某县县政府竟把自己团队的士兵化装成难民，赶着几十辆大车浩浩荡荡的去领救济面。某专署的副官也被造在难民册子里，县党部书记长的老太爷，县长的弟弟也列到难民队里领救济粮，所以老百姓说国民党的所谓救济，实际都是“救己”。难民只有望梅止渴。

    民间流行着一段“县长的天地”，颇能反映出一般官僚群的荒淫无耻和所谓“吏治”，现录如下：
    未上任，穷天穷地。
    一上任，欢天喜地。
    上任后，花天酒地。
    吹牛皮，谈天说地。
    办事情，欺天骗地。
    发脾气，咒天骂地。
    要贿赂，瞒天瞒地。
    对百姓，凶天恶地，
    动公愤，哭天泣地，
    请你走，谢天谢地。
    从四，五月间河南的参议会的质问中也可以看到那些自称“民之父母”的老爷们在干着什么勾当，上下层之间又是如何狼狈为奸，互相包庇，勾结。在四月三十号的会议上参议员郭海长说：“有许多县长或因贪污有据撤职，或因控告而押解来省，只说一解到省了，也就没有下落了。如前获嘉县长张某，四区专署秘书，都解来了，可是现在他们那儿去了呢？……沈化南参议员说：“前光山县长，沦陷时，有渎职守，被撤职查办了，也不知真的办了没有，现在却又委为商邱县长，而且是大县。”参议员张××说：“县长交代不清，前任影响后任，这样下去，如何了得！前夏山县长庞某擅离职守，自田粮处提款数十万，现在不知去向，也没人追问。”由于吏治不清，相互纵容包庇，毒品也因而充斥，参议员苗某提出：“乡镇长有抽老海的，县政府科长有抽老海的，甚至连省府派出的禁烟委员也有抽老海的。这毒品是那里来的？是走私商人运来的？乡镇长包庇他们？公安局长包庇他们？国军比较好些？”白宗德接着说：“毒品充斥全省，它来自开封朝鲜人手中，朝鲜人大多与省垣要人有关。”另外某参议员提出各县买卖乡镇长情事，据说贫乡二十万，肥乡有到二百多万的。这些发言，自然还不足以暴露国民党官场的千分之一。但可以帮助我们了解为什么胜利后，国民党区老百姓仍过着使人难以置信的痛苦时光。

    有个署名苦水的写了一首诗，题名“饥饿线上”主要叙述胜利后河南人民在国民党统治下的惨状。兹抄在下边，作为本篇的结尾！
    水灾、旱灾、蝗虫，
    苛捐、杂税、兵差，
    忍饿受饥。
    在敌人的刺刀下，
    这不是人间；
    这是地狱的生涯！
    如今，
    河山已光复，
    物价应下跌，
    负担应减轻，
    民生应安定，
    那知道？！
    粮价如往。（其实反攻后粮食已涨了四五十倍了）
    百物高昂！
    那知道？！
    要款又要粮，
    摊派仍照常！（事实上，何止“照常”！）
    修堡又抓丁，
    城乡受灾殃，
    “朱们酒肉臭，
    路有饿死骨，
    老弱转沟壑，
    壮者跑四方。”
    问苍天，
    那里是我们的生路？
