　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Cui Tianfu, Acting Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Liberated Areas Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram to Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Director of the China Labor Association, stating: "I have just learned that the Chongqing Labor Association and its Workers' Welfare Cooperative, which it organized, were forcibly taken over by special agents in the name of the bogus "Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions" a few days ago, and more than 30 Labor Association staff members were arrested. This move is clearly a further crime by the reactionaries to destroy people's organizations and deprive people of their rights. The Labor Association, under your leadership, has been painstakingly managed and has achieved remarkable results. We, the members of this association, are all indignant at this brutal trampling. I represent all the workers in the liberated areas in lodging a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities, and hope that you will persevere and strive for recovery. Our association is pledged to be your support!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Regarding the forcible takeover of the Chongqing office of the China Labor Association by the Kuomintang authorities, and the assault and arrest of personnel by special agents, the reporter specifically interviewed Zhu Baoting, a veteran of the Chinese workers' movement and member of the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Areas Federation of Trade Unions. Old Zhu said: "This incident is yet another manifestation of the fascist atrocities of the Kuomintang authorities in destroying workers' freedom of assembly, association, and personal freedom." Old Zhu continued: "The China Labor Association united the worker masses during the War of Resistance Against Japan, supported the war, and strived for the welfare and freedom of workers. After the war, under the leadership of Mr. Zhu Xuefan, it fought alongside the broad masses of people throughout the country to win domestic peace and democracy, and won the support of workers in the Kuomintang areas. Last year, the Liberated Areas Federation of Trade Unions joined the association, making it the largest mass organization of workers in China. The Chiang Kai-shek government's violent destruction of the Labor Association is clearly aimed at undermining this powerful and prestigious people's organization in the peace and democracy movement, so that it can carry out the civil war even more unscrupulously." Mentioning the arrest of members of the Workers' Welfare Committee, Old Zhu was particularly indignant. He said: "Workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are unemployed, starving, and dying in the streets. The Chiang government not only ignores this, but also cruelly destroys workers' organizations that seek their own welfare, determined to cut off the workers' path to survival." Old Zhu finally made a powerful judgment: "Chinese workers will never allow Chiang Kai-shek to continue this illegal atrocity. I believe that workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will surely rise up to defend their own democratic and survival rights, oppose internal warfare and dictatorship, and fight resolutely for national peace and democracy. The workers and people of the entire liberated area must give them effective assistance."

　　崔田夫电慰朱学范氏
    抗议国民党摧残劳协
    朱宝庭同志痛斥蒋政府非法暴行
    号召全解放区职工有效支援劳协
    【新华社延安二十五日电】中国解放区职工联合会筹备会代主任崔田夫电中国劳动协会主任朱学范先生称：“顷悉重庆劳动协会与其所举办的职工福利社于日前被特务机关假“渝市总工会”名义武力接收，并捕去劳协职员三十余人，此举显系反动派更进一步摧残人民团体、剥夺人民权利的罪恶。缘劳动协会在先生领导下，惨淡经营，成绩卓著，今次遭此横暴蹂躏，敝会同人闻此，莫不愤慨。我代表解放区全体工友们向国民党当局提出严重抗议，并希再接再厉，力争恢复，敝会誓为后盾！”
    【新华社延安二十五日电】为中国劳动协会重庆办事处被国民党当局武力接收、人员遭特务殴打与逮捕事，记者特走访中国职工运动老前辈解放区职工联合会筹委会委员朱宝庭氏，朱老谈称：“这一事件，是国民党当局摧残工人集会结社人身自由的法西斯暴行之又一表现。”朱老继称：“中国劳动协会在抗战中团结工人群众，支持抗战，并为职工谋福利争自由；抗战以后，该会在朱学范先生领导下，和全国广大人民一起为争取国内和平民主而奋斗，深得国民党区域职工的拥护。去年解放区职工联合会加入该会，使该会成为全中国工人自己最广大的群众组织。蒋介石政府以暴力破坏劳协，显然是为了破坏这一和平民主运动中有力量有威信的人民团体，以便更肆无忌惮的进行内战。”提到工人福利委员的被捕时，朱老尤为愤慨，他说：“国民党统治区工人失业，饥饿倒毙街头，蒋政府不但置之不理，而且当工人组织自谋福利的社团时，蒋政府不惜加以摧残，必使工人生路断绝而后快。”朱老最后下了一个有力的判断：“中国工人决不容许蒋介石继续这一非法暴行，我相信国民党统治区的工人，一定会起来为保卫工人自己的民主和生存权利、反对内战独裁、争取全国和平民主而坚决斗争。全解放区的职工和人民，一定要给他们以有效的援助。”
