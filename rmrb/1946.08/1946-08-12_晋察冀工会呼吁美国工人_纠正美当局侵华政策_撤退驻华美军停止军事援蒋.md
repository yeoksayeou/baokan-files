Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th: The US Marine Corps stationed on the Beining Railway in North China are openly assisting Chiang's troops in launching a large-scale offensive against Xianghe and Sanhe in the Jidong Liberated Area. Leaders of various trade union organizations in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, including Ma Huizhi, Director of the Jin-Cha-Ji General Trade Union; Chen Baoyu, Director of the Jizhong General Trade Union; Gu Shouzhen, Director of the Ji-Jin General Trade Union; Ding Yi, Director of the Jidong General Trade Union; Hao Zhanyuan, Director of the Rehe General Trade Union; Li Chi, Director of the Chahar Provincial General Trade Union; Xiao Ming, Director of the Zhangjiakou General Trade Union; Chen Ruren, Director of the Electrical Workers' General Trade Union; Sun Yuhui, Director of the Mining Workers' General Trade Union; Feng Shuzhang, Director of the Postal Workers' General Trade Union; and Xu Ping, Director of the PingSui Railway General Trade Union, on behalf of 400,000 workers in the border region, urgently telegraphed Murray, President of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, calling on American worker brothers to swiftly rise up and stop this policy of aggression and intervention in China by the American reactionaries. The telegram stated: "The wise policies of the late President Roosevelt and President Truman's statements on China have now been openly abandoned by the reactionaries in your country. Due to the unbridled participation of US troops stationed in China in China's civil war, especially now that they have further torn off the mask of neutrality and directly assisted Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary troops in attacking Sanhe, Xianghe, and other places in the Jidong Liberated Area, the independence and peace that the Chinese people have fought for with blood for a long time have now been severely undermined by the Chinese and American reactionaries. This erroneous policy of American imperialist elements, which endangers world peace, is also contrary to the wishes and interests of American workers. We urgently appeal: (1) Demand that American workers rise up to correct the erroneous policies of the US government, withdraw the US army, navy, and air force stationed in China, cease military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and withdraw from China's civil war vortex. (2) Stop any material assistance and the transportation of troops and equipment to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique, and demand that American railway workers and dockworkers unanimously refuse to transport any materials that could promote China's civil war." The telegram concluded: "If the United States only implements the above two points, China will move towards peace and democracy, and China and the United States can have friendly cooperation and enhance friendship and economic development between the two countries."

    【新华社张家口九日电】驻中国北宁路美军陆战队，公开协助蒋军向冀东解放区香河、三河大举进攻。晋察冀边区各职工团体领袖、晋察冀总工会主任马辉之、冀中总工会主任陈宝玉、冀晋总工会主任顾守真、冀东总工会主任丁一、热河总工会主任郝占元、察哈尔省总工会主任李痴、张家口总工会主任萧明、电业总工会主任陈儒仁、矿山总工会主任孙玉惠、邮务总工会主任冯树章、平绥铁路总工会主任徐平等，顷代表边区四十万工人急电美国产业工会联合会主席莫莱、劳工联合会主席格林等，呼吁美国工人兄弟迅速起来制止美反动派此种对华侵略干涉政策。该电称：“故罗斯福总统明智的政策及杜鲁门总统对华声明，现已被贵国反动派公开抛弃，由于驻华美军肆无忌惮的参与中国内战，特别目前已进一步撕毁中立的面目，直接协助蒋介石反动军队进攻冀东解放区三河、香河等地，中国人民长期浴血抗战所争取的独立和平，现已遭到中美反动派极其严重的破坏。美帝国主义分子此种危害世界和平的错误政策，同样是违背美国工人愿望和利益的。我们紧急呼吁：（１）要求美国工人起来纠正美国政府的错误政策，撤退驻华的海陆空军，停止军事援蒋，退出中国的内战漩涡。（２）停止对蒋介石反动派任何物资援助与运兵运械，并要求美国铁路工人与码头工人一致拒运任何足以促成中国内战的物资。该电最后称：只要求美国实行以上两条，中国就能走向和平民主，中美两国就可以友好合作，并增进两国友谊及经济发展。
