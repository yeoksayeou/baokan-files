Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th—Shanghai Dispatch: After Chiang Kai-shek's "August 13th" proclamation was issued, Mr. Shen Junru, representative of the China Democratic League, made a commentary here on August 14th. Regarding the six guidelines he proposed for handling the current situation, he believed that, based on the experience of the past six months of negotiations, unless the government is reorganized and all political issues are resolved through consultation in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and the principles of the draft constitution, any method proposed unilaterally without consultation as the main approach will not achieve any results. Regarding the Youth Party's suggestion that the Kuomintang convene a "cessation of hostilities" meeting in Lushan in an attempt to force the democratic parties to submit to unreasonable demands, Shen stated: Apart from resolving domestic political issues by following the resolutions of the PCC, any new approach that overturns the PCC resolutions, such as "cessation of hostilities" meetings, will not yield any results. He and his colleagues in the Democratic League firmly oppose this.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th—Shanghai's "Era" magazine, issue 170, commented on Chiang Kai-shek's "August 13th" Lushan proclamation, stating: "Although Chairman Chiang repeatedly says that he will definitely implement the PCC resolutions," in reality, there is not a single point that conforms to the PCC resolutions. For example, taking the six guidelines he mentioned, none of them conform to the PCC resolutions: First, the PCC resolutions do not stipulate that the National Assembly should be convened on November 12th; second, the resolutions in the PCC resolutions regarding the principles for amending the draft constitution are not to be provided for national discussion and selection, but rather for the National Assembly to discuss and implement; third, regarding expanding the foundation of the government, the proportion and candidates are to be discussed and decided by the PCC. The PCC did not stipulate that the Kuomintang should invite participation unilaterally; fourth, regarding the cessation of conflict, the agreement never contained any provisions regarding the Communist army withdrawing from certain areas that already constitute a "threat to peace" and "obstruct traffic"; fifth, regarding political disputes, the government has consistently stated in the past that the Communist army has not faithfully implemented the sincerity of stopping the conflict and restoring traffic, so it has never really intended to adopt a political solution; sixth, the current threats to the people's peace, security, and life and property are mainly due to the rampant activities of special agents and thugs actively launched by the authorities. The guarantee of the people's basic rights, which was clearly stipulated in the PCC resolutions and personally permitted by Chairman Chiang at the opening of the PCC, has not been fulfilled at all. Where is there any compliance with the PCC resolutions? In fact, Chairman Chiang's entire proclamation, when stripped bare, is nothing more than: "You Communists deserve to die, and I should launch a full-scale civil war to eliminate you!"

### 沈钧儒氏评蒋介石文告  须循协商解决国是  反对其他片面办法

　　沈钧儒氏评蒋介石文告
    须循协商解决国是
    反对其他片面办法
    【新华社延安廿四日电】沪讯：蒋介石“八一三”文告发表后，民盟代表沈钧儒氏，于八月十四日在此间发表评论，对其所提出之六项处理时局之方针，认为根据半年来谈判的经验，除非遵照政协决议宪草原则以协商方式进行改组政府，解决一切政治问题外，任何不以协商为主而由片面提出的办法，将不会获致任何结果。关于青年党建议国民党在庐山召开“息争”会议，企图压迫民主党派屈服于无理要求一事，沈氏称：除遵循政协决议解决国内政治问题外，任何推翻政协决议之新方式如“息事”会议之类，都决不会有任何结果。对此，渠个人暨民盟同人坚决反对。
    【新华社延安廿五日电】沪时代杂志第一百七十期评论蒋介石“八一三”庐山之文告称：“蒋主席虽然口口声声说一定实行政协决议”，实际上却没有半点合乎政协决议的地方。譬如就其所举的六项方针而言，就没有一项是合乎政协决议的：第一、政协决议并没有规定十一月十二日召开国民大会；第二、政协决议中关于宪草修改原则的决议，不是提供国家讨论选择，而是要国大商讨执行的；第三、关于扩大政府基础，是要由政协讨论决定比例及人选的，政协并没有规定要由国民党一党邀请参加；第四、关于停止冲突，协定中也从无关于要共军撤出若干已经构成“和平威胁”和“阻碍交通”的地区的规定；第五、关于政治纷争，政府过去一贯是说共产党军队没有忠实执行停止冲突、恢复交通的诚意，因此也一直未打算真正采取过政治解决的；第六、目前造成对于人民安居乐业和人民生命财产的威胁的，主要由于当局所积极发动的特务暴徒的横行，政协决议中所明白规定和蒋主席在政协开幕时所亲自允许关于人民基本权利的保障，到现在一点也未见兑现。这那里有符合政协决议的地方？实际上蒋主席全部文告拆穿了，还不是一句：“你共产党罪该万死，我应该进行全面内战消灭你！”
