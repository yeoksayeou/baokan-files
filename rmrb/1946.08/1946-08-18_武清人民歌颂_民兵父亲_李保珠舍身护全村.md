Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. The story of the "Father of the Militia" sacrificing himself to rescue the villagers of Wuqing from danger is spreading throughout Wuqing. At dawn on June 2nd, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Wuqing surrounded Fenglin Village, driving all the villagers to the wheat threshing ground at the edge of the village, shouting wildly for the militia captain to be handed over. The villagers huddled together, and no one spoke. Chiang's military officers dragged out four or five young men from the crowd and beat them with gun butts. Women and children covered their faces, and the whole place was quiet. Still, no one uttered a word. The Chiang troops became enraged and set up machine guns in front of the crowd. A bloody massacre was about to begin. The old father of the militia captain, Li Baozhu, disregarding everyone's obstruction, squeezed to the front and said loudly, "My son is the militia captain, and he and his team have already moved away." Chiang's officers and soldiers grinned and tied the gray-haired old man to the nearby Tang'erli stronghold. On Tang'erli Street, a special agent named Feng asked him, "Aren't you the chairman of the Farmers' Association in Fenglin Village? You even reduced rent, didn't you?" "It should be reduced!" Li Baozhu answered firmly. The Chiang and puppet troops and local tyrants interrogated him with cruel torture. Li Baozhu died several times from the bloody beatings. The Chiang troops even used pliers to pull out the beard on his face, and blood covered both cheeks, but he never yielded. The special agents could not extract any information about the militia from him. After a few days, "Father of the Militia" Li Baozhu was finally rescued from the prison by the soldiers. This heroic story has become a banner for all the women, children, and old people in the county to persuade their husbands and encourage their sons to join the militia, help the militia, and inspire them to fight a decisive battle against the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops.

　　武清人民歌颂“民兵父亲”
    李保珠舍身护全村
    【新华社延安十四日电】武清全境到处流传着“民兵父亲”舍身救护全村乡亲脱险的故事。六月二日拂晓，武清蒋军包围了凤林村，把全村老百姓都赶到村边打麦场里，狂暴叫嚣交出民兵队长，乡亲们紧紧挤着，谁也没有作声。蒋军军官从人群里拉出四五个青年来，拿枪托殴打，妇女儿童都掩着脸，全场静悄悄依然没有人吐露一句话，蒋军恼羞成怒，在人群前架起机枪，一场流血成河的大屠杀，眼看就要开始了。民兵队长的老父亲李保珠，这时不顾众人阻拦，挤到前头来高声说道：“我儿子就是民兵队长，他和队伍们早转移走了”。蒋军官兵们狞笑着，把这头发苍白的老汉绑到附近唐二里据点去了。在唐二里街上，一个姓冯的特务问他：“你不是凤林村的农会主任吗、还减租吧？”“该减就减！”李保珠这样坚定的回答着。蒋伪军同恶霸用酷刑审讯他，李保珠血淋淋死去数次，蒋军并用钳子拔掉他脸上的胡子，鲜血布满两腮，但他始终没有屈服，特务从他嘴里探听不出丝毫关于民兵的消息。过了几天，“民兵父亲”李保珠，终于被子弟兵们从监狱里抢救出来了。这一英雄故事，便成为全县妇孺老少劝夫勉子、参加民兵帮助民兵、激励他们与进犯蒋军作决死战斗的旗帜。
