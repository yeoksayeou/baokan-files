Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 26th: Representatives of people's organizations in Shanghai recently jointly sent a letter to the Paris Peace Conference, stating: "We are deeply regretful that China has not yet become a unified and democratic country. Although our country has representatives attending the Peace Conference, the country they represent is now on the verge of a large-scale civil war. We firmly believe that democracy is the key to peace for China, just as it is for all regions of the world. Therefore, unless fascist forces can be eradicated from the root, and the democratic achievements gained in the war can be firmly established, there will be no guarantee of future peace." The letter pointed out: At present, the Peace Conference already has some signs of splitting into two opposing groups. This kind of situation that violates unity and democracy will only incite the revival of anti-democratic forces around the world and make the struggle for unification and democracy in China even more arduous. The letter stated: "We firmly believe that world peace is indivisible, and therefore we must point out that the increasingly serious situation in China will affect the peace in the Far East. Only by restoring trust and cooperation among the Allied countries and promoting democracy and the people, can all nations ensure the fruits of victory and give the broad masses of people the opportunity to realize the happiness and progress they pursued during the difficult years of the anti-fascist war of aggression." The letter was signed by Ma Xulun, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Yan Baohang, Zhang Naiqi, Mao Dun, Liu Wang Liming, Wu Han, Shen Peilan, Bao Dasan, Hu Ziying, Lei Jieqiong, and others, totaling fifteen people.

　　上海人民团体代表
    联名致函巴黎和会
    中国已濒大规模内战之危境
    不根绝法西斯则和平无保证
    【新华社延安二十六日电】沪市各界人民团体代表顷联名致函巴黎和会称：“吾人对于今日中国迄未成为统一与民主国家，甚表遗憾。吾国虽有代表出席和会，但彼等所代表之国家，现已濒于大规模内战之危境。吾人固知民主对于中国恰如对于世界一般地区同为和平之锁钥，故除非法西斯势力能从根铲除，而战争中所获得之民主成果，能确实树立，则未来之和平无有保证。”该函指出：目前和会已有若干分裂为两个对立集团之迹象，此种违反团结与民主之情形，只有鼓动全世界反民主力之复活，而使中国为统一与民主之斗争更形艰苦。该函称：“吾人确知世界和平之不可分割，因此必须提出：中国现状日益严重，将影响于远东之和平。惟有恢复同盟国家间之信任合作及推动民主与人民，各民族始克确保胜利之成果，而给予广大人民以机会，得以实现反法西斯侵略战争之苦难岁月中所追求之幸福与进步也。”署名该函者有马叙伦、沈钧儒、章伯钧、黄炎培、阎宝航、章乃器、茅盾、刘王立明、吴晗、沈佩兰、包达三、胡子婴、雷洁琼等十五人。
