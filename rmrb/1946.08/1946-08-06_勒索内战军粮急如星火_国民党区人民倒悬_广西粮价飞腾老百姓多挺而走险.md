Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 3rd: Comprehensive news: The Kuomintang authorities have recently intensified the collection of actual grain and extortion of military grain in Sichuan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, and Shaanxi provinces to meet the urgent needs of the civil war. In Sichuan, regardless of the protests of the people of the province, Chiang Kai-shek insisted on implementing the collection of actual grain, demanding 10.35 million shi (a unit of dry measure) of grain from the people of Sichuan, of which the Kuomintang central government was stipulated to receive 5.85 million shi. Due to this harsh policy, in addition to the Sichuan Provincial Assembly and the county assemblies repeatedly sending telegrams of opposition since May, the China Economic Development Association held a symposium on July 12, believing that the authorities' breach of faith would starve the poor people suffering from disaster and famine. In Anhui, despite the Anhui Provincial Assembly sending a petition to Beijing in opposition, the authorities still decided to collect 4.4 million shi of grain in the province. In Tianjin and Beijing, the collection of actual grain, borrowing, and even the assigned collection of public grain are all based on wheat as the standard, which is one to two times more expensive than miscellaneous grains. Moreover, it has been a month since the wheat harvest, and there is very little wheat in storage. Forcing the collection of wheat is met with opposition from the people who are unprepared. The Jiangxi Provincial Kuomintang authorities' collection of "surplus grain" has not eased up even after the tragic death of the former director of the Land and Grain Department, Cheng Maoxing, who was forced to death. According to a person in charge of the Land and Grain Department: 250,000 shi have already been "purchased," and 300,000 shi are still needed. The provincial government authorities ordered all grain administration personnel to go to various places to urge the collection. Due to transportation difficulties, even requisitioning fishing boats from Poyang Lake and other places cannot meet the urgent needs. Therefore, civilian labor is forcibly requisitioned. Now, in the Xinjiang, Ganjiang, and Raohe areas, all the people have been mobilized to undertake transportation, and several people die of starvation by the roadside every day. As a result, in more than ten counties including Ande, more than 75% of the fields are barren, and the disaster victims are using tree bark, grass roots, and wild vegetables to fill their hunger. Because the area for seedling transplantation is only one-third of last year, it is estimated that the autumn harvest is already unthinkable. In Shaanxi, in early June, wheat disasters occurred in more than ten counties including Xianyang, Wugong, Huayin, @ County, E County, Taiyang, Shang County, Jingyang, Zhen'an, Zhashui, Yaoxian, Fuping, and Shiquan; the average harvest was only 30-40%, but the provincial government still ordered the county magistrates and deputy directors of the Land and Grain Department to go to the countryside to accelerate the collection of accumulated land taxes, requiring them to be collected within 20 days.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 3rd: Guilin News: A wave of rice looting has been universally triggered in various parts of Guangxi. Military vehicles sent to Yishan, Nandan, Hechi and other places to buy rice, even though they were carrying armed escorts of military police, were often looted by hungry people at the sound of a whistle. The reason is that the disaster in Guangxi is serious, and the price of rice has broken the 100,000 yuan mark, which is the highest record in the country. It is extremely difficult for ordinary people to maintain their lives even with tree bark and grass roots. Not only can they not see relief agencies such as the Relief Administration, but it is reported that even the Guilin merchants once jointly requested a loan of 10 million yuan from the Farmers Bank to go to Guizhou to purchase rice and provide relief to Guilin, but this was rejected by the provincial government authorities. Many local people are taking risks.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 3rd: Shanghai Wenhui Daily published on July 13: According to a person from Dushan, Guizhou, regarding the victory of the local people in resisting the Kuomintang army, a Kuomintang army artillery battalion passed through Dushan in 17 cars and violently beat the ordinary people when buying rice in the city. At that time, it aroused the resistance of more than a thousand people who were at the market, and the sound of shouting and beating shook the whole city. Even the police said: "It is unacceptable for the army to beat the ordinary people arbitrarily." The perpetrators immediately fled into the car, and more than a thousand people surrounded the car, including some people holding hand grenades. Seeing this, the county magistrate of the county urgently negotiated with the battalion commander, handed over the perpetrators to the county for punishment, and the battalion commander apologized to the people.

　　勒索内战军粮急如星火
    国民党区人民倒悬
    广西粮价飞腾老百姓多挺而走险
    【新华社延安三日电】综合消息：国民党当局近在川皖赣冀陕各省加紧征实及勒索军粮，以应内战急需。在四川，蒋介石不顾该省人民的抗议，坚持实行征实，向川省人民索取粮食一千零三十五万市石，其中规定国民党中央政府得五百八十五万市石。由于这一苛政，除四川省参议会及各县参议会五月以来即纷纷一再通电反对外，中国经济事业协进会并于七月十二日举行座谈会，认为当局这一失信行动，势将饿死灾荒下贫苦老百姓。在安徽，虽经皖省参议会赴京请愿反对，当局仍定在该省征粮四百四十万石。在平津，征实征借，以至带征公粮等，一律以小麦为标准，比缴杂粮贵一倍至二倍，且收麦已过一月，存麦无几，强迫征麦，人民没有准备，莫不反对。江西省国民党当局征收“余粮”，并不因前任田粮处长程懋型氏惨遭逼死而稍趋缓和。据田粮处某负责人谈：已“采购”二十五万石，尚差三十万石，省府当局令粮政全体人员分赴各地全力督促。由于运输困难，征用鄱阳湖等地渔船犹不能应付急需，遂强征民力，现信江、赣江、饶河一带，人民悉数被调担任运输，饿死路旁者日有数起，因此安德等十余县，田地荒芜现已有百分之七十五以上、灾民以树皮草根野菜充饥，因抽苗之地仅及去年三分之一，预计秋收已不堪设想。在陕西，六月初旬，咸阳、武功、华阴、＠县、鄂县、邰阳、商县、泾阳、镇安、柞水、耀县、富平、石泉等十多县发生麦灾；平均收成只三四成，但省政府仍令各县县长及田粮副处长下乡加紧督征，积欠田赋，限二十日内征齐。
    【新华社延安三日电】桂林讯：广西各地普遍激起抢米的怒潮，派往宜山、南丹、河池等地买米的军车，虽然车上坐有武装押运的宪兵，也常被饥民在一声呼哨下抢了去。缘广西灾荒严重，米价竟突破十万元大关，为全国最高纪录。老百姓连以树皮草根来维持生命也极感困难，不但见不到救济分署之类的救济机关，据闻连桂林商民曾联名呈请向农民银行借一千万万元赴黔购米来桂救济，亦遭省政当局拒绝。许多地方民众，乃挺而走险。
    【新华社延安三日电】沪文汇报七月十三日载：据贵州独山来人谈及目击该地人民反抗国民党军获得胜利之经过，国民党军炮兵营乘十七辆汽车，路过独山，在该城买米竟凶殴老百姓，当时激起赶集的人民千余人反抗，喊打之声震动全城，连警察也说：“军队任意打老百姓这不得了”。肇事者即逃匿车内，千余人民将该车包围，其中并有持手榴弹的人民。该县县长见状，急向营长交涉，将肇事者交县惩办，并由营长向人民道歉。
