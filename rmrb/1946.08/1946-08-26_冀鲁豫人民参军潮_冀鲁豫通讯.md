　　Hebei-Luyu People's Joining-the-Army Tide
    Hebei-Luyu Communication
    Since Chiang Kai-shek's troops have launched large-scale offensives against our liberated areas in the Northeast, Central Plains, Shanxi, Northern Jiangsu, and Shandong, the peasants in the Huxi Liberated Area who have turned over under the leadership of the Communist Party have been sending their children to the battlefield one after another. Zhu Gongdun of Peixian County said to his son: "Xiao, go! In the past, we begged for food and were treated like animals. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, we would still be suffering from the cold!" After hearing his father's words, the son joined the army. Yongqing and his wife went to the chairman to register their son. Mother Meng of Renzhuang persuaded her son to join the army, saying, "The farmers' association will take care of the family affairs, so you can go without worry!" The model militia squad leader of Fengxian Chengguan District signed up to join the army, saying, "I used to be so hungry that my eyes turned yellow and black. Today, the Communist Party saved us, so we have to work hard." Liu Bangqi of Xige Village in Peixian County, his whole family turned over after the Communist Party came, and they had food to eat. When he heard that Old Chiang was fighting a civil war, because he didn't have a young son to join the army, he led his wife and six-year-old daughter to welcome the new soldiers. He carried a pot of wine, knelt in front of the new soldiers, and offered them wine for the journey, and said angrily: "Comrades, the Communist Party led me to turn over, and my heart will never forget it. You go to the front to defeat Old Chiang's offensive, your parents are my parents, I will do whatever I can, and if anyone is sick, I will take care of the decoction." The young men of Peixian County were even more angry when they heard the news that Chiang Kai-shek was fighting a civil war and would not allow the people to turn over. Five hundred people automatically signed up to enlist. In each district, thousands of people welcomed them in the rain or shine, with carts, mules, and horses. Some young men who did not meet the standards or were not old enough cried and made a fuss when they were persuaded to go home: "Can't we fight Chiang Kai-shek? We will stay here no matter what, and we will not go back even if we die!..." After three mobilizations, there were still four young comrades who resolutely refused to go back, and they were only happy when they were allowed to join the army. When you ask them why they want to join the army, their answers are as firm as steel, "Defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive," "Defend the fruits of victory," and "Thoroughly turn over." At present, in all districts of the county, fathers send their sons, wives persuade their husbands, and members of the farmers' association and militia are vying to join the army. Model figures are emerging continuously. The upsurge of joining the army and opposing the civil war is boiling among the 100,000 people in Peixian County, and everyone has a firm confidence in victory.

　　冀鲁豫人民参军潮
    冀鲁豫通讯
    自从蒋介石的队伍向咱们东北、中原、山西、苏北、山东等解放区大规模进攻以来。我湖西解放区在共产党领导下翻了身的农民，都纷纷送他们的子弟上战场。沛县朱公敦向他儿说：“小呀，你去吧！过去要饭与人当牛马，要不是共产党八路军、咱们还得受苦寒哩”！儿子听了父亲的话后，就参军去了。永清夫妇到会长那里与儿报名。任庄孟母劝子参军，说：“家里的事有农会来照顾，你放心去吧！”丰县城关区民兵模范班长报名参军，他说：“从前常常饿得两眼黄黑，今天共产党救了咱，咱得干”。沛县溪阁村的刘邦其，他全家在共产党来到后翻了身，有了饭吃，他听说老蒋打内战，因没有年轻的儿子去参军，他就领着他的老婆和六岁的女孩子去欢送新战士，他提着一壶酒，跪在新战士的面前敬送行酒，并愤愤的说：“同志，共产党领导我翻了身，我心永不能忘，你们到前方去打败老蒋的进攻，你的爹娘就是我的爹娘，大小活我只要能干就去干，倘若谁家有了病，煎汤熬药俺来管。”沛县的青年小伙子，听到蒋贼打内战不叫人民翻身的消息，更是愤怒，自动报名入伍的就有五百名，各区千百群众风雨无阻，大车小车、骡马花舆的去欢送，一些不合标准不够年龄的小伙子，当劝他们回家时，每次所得的结果是惹得他们乱哭乱吵：“俺们打蒋介石不中吗？赖也要赖在这里，死也不回去！……”经过三次的动员，还有四位小同志坚决不愿回去，直到允许他参军时才高兴了。你问他们为什么要去参军，他们的回答像钢铁一样的坚决，“打退蒋介石的进攻”，“保卫胜利果实”，“彻底翻身”。目前全县各区爹送子，妇劝夫，农会员、民兵等，都争着参军，模范人物不断涌现，参军反内战的热潮，在沛县十万群众中沸腾着，大家都有着坚定的胜利信心。
