　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. London dispatch: The Manchester Guardian, the organ of the British Liberal Party, commented on the Chinese situation and American policy on the 24th, stating that the Chinese civil war and economic situation are "distressing." Regarding the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the report stated that the CCP refused to withdraw its troops from the occupied areas or abolish local governments until it was convinced that Chiang Kai-shek was sincere in organizing a coalition government and ending one-party dictatorship; while Chiang Kai-shek was unwilling to take such steps before the main rivers and railways were decisively placed under the control of the central government. The report pointed out: "Most observers believe that the Communist Party's suspicions are more justified." The report continued: "There are many liberal and progressive figures in the Kuomintang who genuinely admire democracy, but behind them are powerful forces, especially in the army and police, who do not hide their hatred of the Communist Party. These people incite Chiang Kai-shek (Editor's note: In fact, Chiang Kai-shek is the leader of such people) to annihilate the Communist Party while the Kuomintang army can still rely on American support. These people include large landowners and corrupt officials in various provinces. For them, the destruction of China is not a big deal as long as it does not harm their interests." Regarding the US policy towards China, the report stated: "In this situation in China, the United States has a major responsibility. In any case, the US government has supported the central government with military force during and after the war. The Kuomintang army is trained and equipped by the US military, and American weapons are often transported by US ships and planes. Marshall cannot hide the fact that the existence of the central government depends on American economic assistance. The US policy could be justified if it promoted some progress towards peace and democracy between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but it has not achieved this. In the areas controlled by the Communist Party, it is sufficient to prove that their administration is more effective and more popular than what the Kuomintang has done." The report concluded: "If after the US military has been stationed in China for a year, there is no good sign other than continuing the civil war and economic chaos, then it will be even more difficult to justify the US military's presence in China."

　　英自由党机关报著文称
    中国内战美应负责         
    指责蒋介石无理固执独裁
    【新华社延安一日电】伦敦讯：英自由党机关报曼彻斯特导报于二十四日评论中国形势与美国政策称：中国的内战与经济局势“令人痛心”。关于国共之谈判，该报称：中共在未确信蒋介石对组织联合政府、结束一党专政确具诚意前，拒绝撤退其占领区之军队或撤销地方政权；而蒋介石在主要的河流与铁路未决定地置于中央政府管制之前，或不愿采取这种步骤。该报指出：“多数观察家以为共产党的怀疑比较有理由”。该报继称：“国民党中有不少自由进步的人物，他们真心真意地崇尚民主，但是在他们背后是强大的势力，尤其是陆军与警察方面，他们并不愿隐藏其对中共的仇视，这种人煽动蒋介石（编者按：实际上蒋介石正是上述这种人之首脑），在国民党军队依然能够依赖美国支持的时候，歼灭共产党。这些人包括各省的大地主、腐败官吏等。对于他们，只要不损害他们的利益，中国的毁灭也没有多大关系”。该报关于美国对华政策称：“在中国这种局势下，美国负有重大责任，不论如何，美国政府在战时及战后以兵力支持了中央政府，国民党军队是由美军训练配备，美国武器时常由美轮与飞机运送。马歇尔不能隐藏这个事实，即中央政府的存在，依赖美国的经济协助。美国的政策，如为促进国共间和平民主的若干进步，则即可说明它的正当，但是它没有这种成就。在共产党管制的区域内，足以证明他们的行政比国民党所做到的更为有效，更得民心”。该报结语称：“如果美军在中国驻了一年之后，除继续内战与经济混乱之外，别无好现象，那么要证明美军驻华的正当，更是困难了”。
