　　Old Hero Cultivates New Heroes
    Wang Qishou Trains Troops While Fighting
    Entire Company Achieves Average Grenade Throw of 39.2 Meters

    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch, 24th] Comrade Wang Qishou, the company commander of the Eighth Company of the Independent First Regiment of the Fourth Military Sub-district of the Taiyue Military Region, is a model of fighting and training troops. He once served as the captain of the Yicheng Fourth District Cadre Team and was a hero in the struggle against the enemy within the grid network. He was also a top combat hero at the first Taiyue District Heroes Conference. The characteristic of his leadership is that he can both fight and seize opportunities for education. He created a style of training troops by utilizing the gaps in combat within the grid network, and this characteristic is still maintained and developed today. This year, due to the need to defend positions, the Eighth Company was unable to conduct concentrated training specifically, but the Eighth Company created training achievements that surpassed any other company. The average grenade throw of the entire company was 39.2 meters, and this achievement is inseparable from the leadership of Comrade Wang Qishou. He can seize every gap to conduct training, and he has created many "Wang Qishous," turning some squad leaders and platoon leaders into his embodiment and spreading them to every corner. Therefore, seizing the gaps to conduct training has become a unique style of the Eighth Company. In March of this year, when the Eighth Company was on guard duty at Majialing, one platoon was sentry, and two platoons were training behind the front line positions. In the middle of the night, before dawn, behind the hillside, and on the parade ground, entire squads and platoons practiced bayonet fighting and grenade throwing. Squad Leader Li ×× is a typical embodiment of Comrade Qishou. Li's body is very weak, but he won first place in the entire company in training. He learned Comrade Wang Qishou's style of being good at uniting comrades and encouraging everyone's morale. Once, when the enemy launched an attack on our front-line position, one platoon of the Eighth Company was on guard in another direction. In addition to sending out sentries to monitor the direction from which the enemy might come, the entire platoon used stones in place of grenades, practicing grenade throwing towards the blind spots that the enemy might use. On the one hand, they prepared for battle, and on the other hand, they practiced martial arts, making use of every bit of time. Another time, when the enemy launched an attack on our outpost position, the Eighth Company was placed in a reserve position preparing for action. Then, the squad leaders taught the soldiers, and the veteran soldiers taught the new soldiers. Everyone, based on the specific terrain and distance, educated the soldiers where the enemy might come from, where they might go, how many meters away, where the effective shooting range of the rifle was, designated targets, and practiced aiming and shooting. Comrade Wang Qishou is good at leadership and can lead by example, which has won the love and support of the masses.

　　老英雄培养新英雄
    王启首战斗不忘练兵
    全连投弹平均三·九二公尺
    【本报阳城二十四日电】太岳四分区独一团八连连长王启首同志是战斗与练兵的模范，他曾任翼城四区干队队长，是格子网里对敌斗争的英雄，是太岳区第一届群英大会的头等战斗英雄。他带兵的特色是既能打仗，又能抓住机会进行教育。他曾在格子网里创造出一套利用战斗空隙练兵的作风，这个特色至今仍在保持和发挥着。今年因为坚守阵地的关系，八连未能专门集中整训，但八连却创造出超过任何连队的练兵成绩，全连平均投弹三九·二米，这成绩是和王启首同志的领导分不开的。他能抓紧一切空隙进行练兵，而且创造出许多的王启首，把一些班长排长都变成了他的化身，散布到每个角落里。因之抓紧空隙进行练兵，就成为八连的特有作风。今年三月里八连在马家岭担任警戒，一个排放哨，两个排在前沿阵地后方练兵，在半夜里、拂晓前、山坡后和操场上，整班整排练习刺枪和投弹。九班长李××同志是启首同志的典型化身，李的身体很弱，但却在练兵中荣获全连第一。他学会了王启首同志善于团结同志又善于鼓励大家情绪的作风。有一次敌人向我们的前沿阵地进攻，八连的一个排在另一个方向担任警戒，他们除派出哨兵监视着敌人可能来的方向外，全排人都以石头代手榴弹，向着敌人可能利用的死角做着投弹练习，一方面准备战斗，一方面又练了武，把一点时间都利用了。又有一次敌人向我们前哨阵地进攻，八连被放在预备阵地里准备着，于是班长教战士，老兵教新兵，大家根据具体的地形及距离，教育战士敌人可能从那里来，到那里去，多少米达、那里是步枪的有效射击距离，指定目标，作射击瞄准，王启首同志善于领导又能以身作则，获得了群众的爱戴和拥护。
