　　Idle Talk on Trying War Criminals
　　邢肇棠
　　A few days ago, I wrote a short article for the Northern Magazine entitled "A Trial That Is Both Very Clear and Very Unclear." The main points in the article were: "Chinese and Japanese fascists colluded in the invasion of China, and both should be punished by law as war criminals. The Chinese fascist remnants headed by Chiang Kai-shek are not qualified to attend the Far East International Military Tribunal as witnesses. It is only natural and proper that the war criminals' defense lawyers questioned Qin Dechun, who dared not refute them, and that Tojo Hideki laughed heartily."
　　Things are becoming clearer. Today, I read in the newspaper:
　　"Tokyo Dispatch: On the 13th, at the Far East International Military Tribunal, an American lawyer for the war criminals, Smith, argued that the Japanese invasion of China was 'legal.' He said, 'Chiang Kai-shek once requested cooperation from Japan.' The Kuomintang representative attending the court, Zhu Shiming, did not speak, tacitly agreeing that Smith was right. The war criminals roared with laughter. Chief Prosecutor Comyns Carr, a witness to the Japanese aggression in North China, was asked by Smith: 'Are you testifying that the Japanese invasion of China was legal, or are you testifying that Japan was an aggressor?' Comyns Carr said, 'Japan was wrong in North China.' Smith then said, 'Then why did you say to me in my hotel three weeks ago that there were many reasons for Japan's occupation of Manchuria and North China?' This prompted another round of laughter from the war criminals. When Chief Prosecutor Keenan saw that it was too outrageous and tried to stop the behavior of the war criminals and defense lawyers, he was protested by Chief Justice Webb."
　　The Chinese people are very angry upon seeing this news, believing that the Kuomintang representative has humiliated the country and disgraced the Chinese people. In fact, this is an emotional reaction from the Chinese people who still regard the fascist elements within the Kuomintang as Chinese.
　　Smith said, "Chiang Kai-shek once requested cooperation from Japan," which is true. It is well known at home and abroad that Chiang Kai-shek, after offering the four northeastern provinces, also recognized the five provinces of North China as "autonomous regions" under Japanese protection, advocated "Sino-Japanese friendship," pursued a policy of "non-resistance," and openly cooperated with the Japanese in attacking the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas after the "July 7th" Incident. Even now, this set of methods is still being relentlessly continued. Cooperating with the Japanese to fight the Chinese people, asking the Japanese to "maintain order," what else is this if not asking for Japanese cooperation? The Kuomintang representative attending the court, Zhu Shiming, naturally dared not say much, tacitly agreeing that Smith was right, which is only to be expected, and there is nothing strange about it.
　　The strange phenomena in the Far East International Military Tribunal are closely linked to the strange phenomena in the Far East political situation. MacArthur's "control" of Japan, the "mediation" of the Chinese civil war under the support of American imperialist policies, and Chiang Kai-shek's "four promises" to the people all unanimously claim to want democracy and peace. But their actions are frantically suppressing democracy and undermining peace. This gang of hypocritical, man-eating war merchants are exactly the same as the Japanese war criminals, with no difference whatsoever. In order to deceive the world, they have to feign "trials" and "testimony." How can their terribly hypocritical faces not provoke laughter from the war criminals?
　　The reactionary judges and defense lawyers at the Far East International Military Tribunal, as well as the Japanese war criminals and Chinese representatives, understand each other and are mutually understanding. They all exchange glances and are single-mindedly plotting how to exonerate their comrades—the war criminals. The so-called "trial" is merely a way to prolong life. What they temporarily do without people knowing, what they consider a secret, what they don't say but constantly think about in their hearts is a brilliant plan to quickly start a third world war. If this suicidal policy called "strategy" can be secretly realized while people all over the world are sleeping, then they will be satisfied, immediately tear off their masks, cancel the "trial" formality, gather together, and then launch another killing spree against the honest people who regard them as democratic leaders, only then can their virtue be displayed. It would also be more worthy of the deceased Mussolini and the missing Hitler.
　　It is obvious to all that today's American imperialists are inheriting the fascist Japan of the "July 7th" Incident, and Chiang Kai-shek is inheriting the traitor Wang Jingwei of the Nanjing puppet government. The filial sons and virtuous grandsons who inherit their ancestors' legacy naturally believe that their ancestors' invasion of China was "legal," the attack on Pearl Harbor was a "misunderstanding," and the occupation of the Philippines was to maintain the "New Order" of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." It is justified and reasonable, so what "law" is being violated?
　　Originally, imperialism and fascism are as black as "a crow flying on a pig's back." They only ended up with family ruin and scattered members due to the uneven distribution of spoils. Now they still have to sing a "bitter pill" show in court. It's really in terrible shape, simply "threading tofu with a horse's tail"—impossible to mention!
　　A group of armored, man-eating beasts are squatting on Chinese territory, sucking the blood of the Chinese people while baring their teeth at democratic countries around the world. The Chinese people are bravely carrying out a war of self-defense. Peace-loving democratic countries and working people all over the world are also collecting their hunting rifles, preparing to eliminate this group of beasts. Look! In the near future, a peaceful, democratic, free, and happy new world and an independent and autonomous new China will surely emerge.

### 闲话审战犯

　　闲话审战犯
    邢肇棠
    前几天给北方杂志写了一篇题为：“非常明白而又非常不明白的一堂会审”的短文。文中的主要意见是：“中日法西斯串通侵华，同为战争罪犯应该同受法律制裁。以蒋介石为首的中国法西斯残余，根本没有资格出席远东国际法庭作证。战犯的辩护律师诘问，秦德纯不敢置辩，东条哈哈大笑，都是当然的，而且是应该的。
    事情越来越明白了，今天又见报载：
    “东京讯：十三日远东国际法庭上战犯的美籍律师史密斯认为日本侵华是“合法”的。他说：“蒋介石曾要求日本合作”。出席法庭的国民党代表朱世明竟未发言，默认史密斯说得有理。一时战犯们哄然大笑。首席检察官高特为日本侵略华北的见证人。史密斯问道：“你是证明日本侵华是合法呢，还是证明日本是侵略呢”？高特道：“日本在华北是不对的”。史密斯道：“那么三星期前你到我旅馆找我时，又为什么说日本占满洲和华北是有许多理由的呢”？引得一群战犯又哈哈大笑，检察长吉楠看见太不像话，起来制止战犯与辩护律师们的行为时，却又遭首席法官韦勃提出抗议。
    中国人民看见这个消息，非常气愤，认为国民党代表丧权辱国，给中国人丢人。其实这是中国人民把国民党内法西斯分子，还当作中国人看待的一种感情作用。
    史密斯说：“蒋介石曾要求日本合作”，那是真的。中外共知，蒋介石除奉送东北四省后，又承认华北五省为日本保护下的“自治区”，“中日亲善”，“不抵抗”，并在“七七”事变后实行观战，公开配合日寇进攻解放区抗日军民。直到现在，这一套办法，还在努力不懈的继续着。配合日本人打中国人，请日本人“维持秩序”，不是要求日本合作是什么？出席法庭的国民党代表朱世明当然不敢多嘴，默认史密斯说得有理，那是应该的，有什么奇怪？
    远东国际法庭上的怪现象与远东政治形势的怪现象是密切结合着的。麦克阿瑟“管制”日本，美帝国主义政策支持下的“调处”中国内战，蒋介石允许人民的“四项诺言”，都异口同声的说要民主，要和平。但他们的行为，却在拚命的镇压民主，破坏和平。这一伙口是心非，披着人皮的战争贩子，恰恰与日本战犯是同样货色，找不到丝毫区别。他们为了欺世欺人，不得不装腔作势的“审判”，“作证”。那副虚伪得可怕的嘴脸，岂能不惹得战犯们哈哈大笑？
    远东国际法庭上的反动法官与辩护律师以及日本战犯与中国代表，彼此心照不宣，互相谅解。大家都用眼角传情，一心盘算着如何解脱同人——战犯的罪名，所谓“审判”也者，不过是苟延岁月而已。暂行作为人不知道，自己认为秘密，口上不说，心上常想的一个高明打算，便是赶快掀起世界第三次战争。把这叫作“谋略”的自杀政策，如果能偷偷的在全世界人民睡觉时突然实现，那就心满意足，立刻撕去假面具，取消“审判”形式，欢聚一堂，再向把他们当作民主领袖的忠厚人民大杀一阵，才能显得出自己的德行。更能对得起死了的墨索里尼与不知下落的希特勒祖师。
    有目共睹，今天的美帝国主义者继承着“七七”事变中的法西斯日本，蒋介石继承着南京伪政府的汉奸汪精卫。继承祖业的孝子贤孙，自然认为祖上的侵华是“合法”，袭击珍珠港是“误会”，占领菲律宾是维持“东亚共荣圈”的“新秩序”。名正言顺，犯什么“法”呢？
    本来，帝国主义与法西斯主义是“乌鸦飞在猪身上”一般黑的禽兽，由于分赃不匀，才闹得家败人亡，四零五散。现在还要在法庭上大唱“苦肉计”。实在糟到极点，简直是“马尾穿豆腐”不能提！
    一群装甲的吃人野兽，蹲在中国领土上，一面吮着中国人民的血，一面向着全世界民主国家出牙。中国人民已英勇的进行着自卫战争。爱好和平的民主国家与全世界劳动人民，也正在收拾猎枪，准备消灭这群野兽。看吧！不久的将来，定会出现一个和平民主自由幸福的新世界与独立自主的新中国。
