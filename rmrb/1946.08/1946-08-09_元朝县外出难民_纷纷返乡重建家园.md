　　[This article was] transmitted from Weixian by this newspaper: With the rapid progress of peaceful production and construction in Yuan Dynasty County, the lives of the masses have generally improved. Those who were forced to flee due to natural disasters and enemy attacks in the past, after receiving information from their hometown, are now returning home one after another. According to incomplete statistics, more than fifty men and women in twenty-seven households throughout the county have returned home successively. There are also many people who have fled from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. For example, Zhang Ruicun and Zhang Xinchao originally worked in a timber factory in Yingchengzi, Jilin. Recently, because the Kuomintang was fighting a civil war in the Northeast, and they were raping and looting everywhere, making it impossible to survive, they returned one after another. The democratic government gave them 100 catties of millet to help them settle down, and helped him find a carpenter job in the city to maintain his life. Others who have returned home successively are also being helped with resettlement and relief.

　　元朝县外出难民
    纷纷返乡重建家园
    【本报威县讯】元朝县和平生产建设突飞猛进，群众生活普遍改善。过去因天灾敌祸被迫逃荒外出者，接家乡信息，现已纷纷还乡。据不完全统计，全县已有二十七户五十多名男女陆续还乡。也有不少人自国民党统治区逃难而来，如张瑞村、张新朝原在吉林营城子木工厂作工，近因国民党在东北打内战，到处奸淫掳掠无法生存，遂先后归来。民主政府为帮助他们按家，特发给小米一百斤，并帮他在城内找到木匠职业，以维持生活。其他陆续还乡者亦正在设法按置救济中。
