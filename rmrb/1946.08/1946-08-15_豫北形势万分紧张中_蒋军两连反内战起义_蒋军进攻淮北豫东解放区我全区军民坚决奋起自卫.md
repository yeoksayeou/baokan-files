　　[This newspaper’s dispatch from Jiaozuo on the 11th] As Bai Chongxi once again arrived in Xinxiang to deploy for civil war, and with the situation in northern Henan extremely tense, the Second and Third Companies of the First Battalion, 530th Regiment, 117th Brigade, 38th Division of Chiang's army, stationed in Huixian, unwilling to be used as cannon fodder in the civil war, gloriously revolted on the evening of the 8th. After the two companies revolted, they were fiercely pursued by Chiang's army, and have now safely arrived in our liberated area. Our local residents immediately gave them a warm welcome, and the officers and soldiers of the uprising were extremely excited.
    [This newspaper’s dispatch from Changzhi on the 12th] In the northern Henan area, Chiang's army is actively deploying for a large-scale civil war, and the stubborn troops are being transferred frequently. The 177th Brigade of the 38th Division was transferred to Huixian in early July, and the 141st Brigade of the 32nd Division, originally stationed in Huixian, was transferred to Xiuwu and Wuzhi, to attack us. On the 13th of last month, the Northern Henan Security Third Column, originally stationed in Jixian, moved between Qixian and Tangyin, and the 110th Brigade of the 85th Division was transferred to Qixian. Around the strongholds of Chiang's army in Huixian and other places, the people are forced to cut down all tall crops, otherwise they will be accused of "colluding with bandits," and even sesame is included in the cutting list. Chiang's army in various places is actively seizing grain and conscripting men to replenish the troops.
    [This newspaper’s dispatch from Jiaozuo on the 10th] Chiang Kai-shek recently used a "beheading policy" to further annex miscellaneous troops, transferring the original officers of miscellaneous troops to other places and replacing them with Whampoa clique officers, attempting to use this to divide miscellaneous troops and carry out civil war. According to reliable sources, Chiang Kai-shek recently sent sixty Whampoa clique officers to the 17th Division of the current 38th Army. A considerable number of Whampoa clique officers have also been sent to other troops. The officers and soldiers of various non-direct-line troops are extremely dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's insidious and vicious plan. Wu Jingye, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the 51st Regiment of the 17th Division, recently led more than ten soldiers to withdraw from the civil war and safely arrived in the liberated area of northern Henan.
    [This newspaper’s dispatch from Heze on the 11th] With the assistance of American imperialist elements, Chiang's army is actively destroying the liberated areas of northern Huaihai and eastern Henan south of the Longhai Railway, attempting to destroy the Jilu豫 [冀鲁豫, short for Hebei-Shandong-Henan] area north of the railway. The entire conspiracy is being carried out step by step. Along the 480-li line between Kaifeng and Xuzhou, the masses are forced to build bunkers and dig blockade ditches, and are ordered to completely remove all tall crops within 400 chi [a unit of length] north and south of the line, destroying a total of 780 square li [a unit of area] of farmland. Since the beginning of August, they have been attacking our Eighth Sub-district of northern Huaihai from the east and west, attempting to compress our army to the area between Xiayi, Yongcheng, and Haoxian and encircle and annihilate us. A division of Cao Fulin's troops of the 55th Army and the puppet Zhang Lanfeng's troops are currently deployed on the line between Shangqiu and Haoxian, gradually advancing eastward. On the Xuzhou side, Chiang's army is using Xiaoxian as a stronghold to exert pressure westward, and the situation is extremely tense. Chiang's army is sending planes to bomb our cities such as Jining and peaceful residents, and is carrying out starvation tactics against our border areas. All of this proves that Chiang Kai-shek's attack on our liberated areas of northern Huaihai and eastern Henan is actually intended to repeat another encirclement and annihilation plan in the Central Plains. Now, the military and civilians of our entire region are resolutely rising up in self-defense, giving the invaders a devastating blow.

　　豫北形势万分紧张中  
    蒋军两连反内战起义            
    蒋军进攻淮北豫东解放区我全区军民坚决奋起自卫
    【本报焦作十一日电】于白崇禧再度抵新（乡）部署内战，豫北形势万分紧急情况下，驻辉县之蒋军三十八师一百一十七旅五百三十团第一营第二、三两连不甘充作内战炮灰，遂于八日晚光荣起义。该两连起义后，曾经蒋军猛烈追击，现已安全抵达我解放区，我当地居民立即予以热烈之欢迎，起义官兵倍加兴奋。
    【本报长治十二日电】豫北方面，蒋军正积极部署大规模内战，顽军调动频繁，三八师一七七旅七月上旬调来辉县，原驻辉之三二师一四一旅调修武、武陟，向我进攻。上月十三日原驻汲县之豫北保安三纵队开淇县、汤阴间，八五师一一零旅调往淇县。辉县等地蒋军据点周围，均强迫人民将高杆作物一律割倒，否则以“通匪”论罪，甚至芝麻亦在被割之列，各地蒋军均积极抢粮抓丁，补充部队。
    【本报焦作十日电】蒋介石近以“杀头政策”，进一步吞灭杂牌部队，将杂牌部队原来军官他调，以黄浦系军官接替，妄图以此分化杂牌进行内战。据可靠消息，蒋介石最近以黄浦系军官六十人派往现三十八军之十七师。其他各部队亦派有相当数量之黄浦系军官。各非嫡系部队官兵对蒋介石此种阴恶毒辣计划，极表不满。十七师五十一团二营营长吴敬业日前率十余士兵退出内战，安抵豫北解放区。
    【本报荷泽十一日电】蒋军在美帝国主义分子援助下，积极摧残我陇海路南之淮北，豫东解放区，企图淮而摧毁路北之冀鲁豫，全部阴谋正在逐步进行。在开封徐州间长达四百八十里，沿线强迫群众修筑碉堡，挖封锁沟，命令群众全部除去沿线南北四百尺以内之高庄稼，毁弃田禾面积达七百八十平方华里之多。自八月初起，东西夹击我淮北八分区，企图将我军压缩至夏邑、永城、毫县间一带围歼。五十五军曹福林所部一个师及伪张岚峰部，刻已部署于商邱、毫县之线，逐渐向东推进。徐州方面，蒋军则以萧县为据点向西压迫，情势异常紧张。蒋军一面派飞机轰炸我济宁等城和平居民，一面对我边沿区进行断食，凡此种种证明蒋介石对我淮北、豫东解放区之进攻，实欲重演再一次的中原围歼计划。现我全区军民坚决奋起自卫，给进犯者以歼灭的打击。
