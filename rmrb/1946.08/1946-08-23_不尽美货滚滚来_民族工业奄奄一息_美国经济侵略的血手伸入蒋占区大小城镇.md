　　The Bloody Hand of American Economic Aggression Reaches into Towns Large and Small in the KMT-Controlled Areas

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] A large number of American goods are flooding into major and minor cities in North and Northwest China. According to Tianjin Customs statistics, for the months of May, June, and July alone, imports of American cigarettes from Shanghai and directly from the United States, including eight brands such as Camel, reached over 152,000 cartons. At the lowest prices, the Camel and Phillip Morris brands alone were worth 100.08 million yuan. More than 40 hand-rolled cigarette factories in Tianjin have closed down due to the squeeze from American cigarettes (there were originally over 100). American goods are also being dumped in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, and the largest cigarette factory in the province, Jinxing Cigarette Factory, is in a state of near shutdown. At the same time, a "craze for American goods" is raging in the large and small counties and towns along the Peiping-Hankou Railway in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. "DDT" and American "baking soda," etc., are flooding the Baoding market. Baking soda produced by China's Yongli Factory costs 50,000 yuan per bag for local delivery, while American baking soda ordered from the U.S. costs only a little over 2 U.S. dollars, or 5,000 to 6,000 legal tender yuan per bag, a difference of ten to one. According to the heads of Yongli and Jiuda, two major chemical industries, these two world-renowned large industries will be shut down because they cannot compete with American goods. In addition, a large number of American goods have recently poured into the Xi'an market, including lipstick, perfume, eyebrow pencils, glassware, clothing, khaki cloth, etc., posing a great threat to local national industries.

　　不尽美货滚滚来
　　民族工业奄奄一息
　　美国经济侵略的血手伸入蒋占区大小城镇
    【新华社延安二十日电】大批美货滚滚流入华北及西北各大小城市。据天津海关统计，仅美烟一项五、六、七三个月内由上海及直接从美国进口者，包括骆驼牌等八种共达十五万二千余条，以最低价格计其中骆驼飞利浦等五种共价值十万万零八千万元。天津手工卷烟厂受美烟排挤倒闭已达四十余家（原有一百多家）。山西太原市上也有美货倾销，全省最大规模的晋兴卷烟厂已陷半停顿状态。与此同时，平汉沿线国民党统治区大小县镇皆在大闹“美货狂”，“ＤＤＴ”和美国“苏打粉”等充斥保定市场，我国永利厂所出碱面当地交货每包须五万元，由美订苏打粉每包仅须美金二元多合法币五六千元，相差为十与一之比。据永利、久大两大化工业负责人谈，此两大世界知名的大工业将因无法与美货竞争而停顿。此外西安市上近也涌到大批美货，口红、香水、眉头、玻璃衣物、哈叽布等等，使当地民族工业遭受莫大威胁。
