Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 13th. During the Zhaoyangji self-defense battle in Yugou at the end of last month, thousands of local militia and masses bravely rushed to the front lines to assist in combat and rescue the wounded. Town Chief Ding of Gaozuo Town personally led his team, closely following the combat troops, braving artillery fire and aerial strafing. When the Chiang army was routed, they charged forward with a burst of energy, rescuing the wounded while shouting alongside the soldiers to the Chiang soldiers, "Lay down your guns!" "The New Fourth Army treats prisoners well!" Immediately, over a hundred Chiang soldiers laid down their arms. Zhang Chiyuan, a villager from Shanghu Township, forced Chiang soldiers to surrender two rifles with just a carrying pole. The Yao圩 Township stretcher team refused to sleep properly for six days and five nights. Team member Zhou Xuxiang said, "Comrades are risking their lives to defend our hometown; what does a little suffering count for?" They transported the spoils of war to the rear without stopping until the task was completely finished.

Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 12th. People in Linyu and other areas along the Great Wall, unable to endure the ravages of Chiang Kai-shek and his puppets, have risen up in self-defense. On the 1st of last month, when Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from Shangzhuangtu invaded Caoyingzhen and Yiyuan Pass, they looted and raped along the way but were repelled by the joint village blocking war launched by nearby militia. On the 2nd and 3rd, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from the area were dispatched again, attempting to retaliate, but were again defeated by the militia. On the 1st, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from Shimenzhai and Dagu, taking advantage of the Caoyingzhen market day, suddenly launched a surprise attack. Upon hearing the news, the militia of nearby villages surrounded the surrounding mountains and repelled them with dense firepower. Enraged by the invasion, the puppet troops from Shangzhuang and Shimenzhai in Shanhaiguan gathered again on the 13th to occupy Caoyingdi. Hundreds of local militia, in coordination with local armed forces, risked an ambush, and people's self-defense teams from dozens of miles around came one after another to deliver food, carry stretchers, and support the battle. After three hours of fighting, the puppet troops collapsed and fled along their original route, leaving more than 30 bodies behind. Since last autumn, with American help, Chiang Kai-shek's troops successively occupied Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, Shimenzhai, Shanhaiguan and other places originally liberated by the Eighth Route Army, and then appointed the 3rd Regiment of the military puppet army security column to garrison and continue to poison the people. According to incomplete statistics from March to June this year: Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops plundered more than 360,000 stones of grain from the masses, extorted more than 290 million yuan, and arrested and killed more than 100 people, including Zhou Yuan, the head of one district.
