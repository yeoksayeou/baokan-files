　　U.S. Troops Should Not Occupy China
    Zeng Yanxiu

    Recently, the U.S. authorities have made several responsible statements regarding the U.S. mission in China, which is the official response to the demands made by Comrade Mao Zedong and Mr. Song Qingling on behalf of the Chinese people over the past month, calling for the U.S. to cease all military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and withdraw all U.S. troops stationed in China. Regarding the former, according to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Washington on June 25th: "A U.S. State Department spokesman reiterated that the stationing of U.S. troops in China is at the request of the Chinese government for the purpose of repatriating Japanese troops in China. The sole purpose of the U.S. military in China is to achieve this." Regarding the latter, according to a U.S. Information Service dispatch from Washington on July 23rd, a State Department spokesman commented on Mr. Song Qingling's recent statement, saying: "The purpose of the U.S. military in China is solely to assist China in completing the withdrawal of Japanese troops from its territory." As is well known, Mr. Truman made a similar statement in his China policy statement last December and in the agreement of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. In the Three Foreign Ministers' agreement, the U.S. side stated: "The important task of the U.S. military is to implement the terms of the Japanese surrender, that is, to disarm the Japanese army and withdraw the Japanese army. When these tasks are completed, or when the Chinese government is able to carry out these tasks without U.S. military assistance, the U.S. military will withdraw from China." However, the actions of the U.S. military in China over the past fourteen months have been inconsistent with and contrary to these statements, because: First, more Japanese prisoners are concentrated in Central and Southern China, but not a single U.S. combat troop has landed there. According to the final announcement by the U.S. military headquarters in Shanghai on the 15th of this month, only 550,000 Japanese prisoners of war (including Japanese nationals) were concentrated at ports in North China for repatriation. The North American army stationed in China has 53,000 troops, and it has been repatriating for ten months, with an average of only one Japanese person repatriated per person per month. Isn't this a huge joke?! Second, the repatriation work, according to the U.S. announcement, has long been handed over to the Kuomintang government and the Japanese side for self-management. On July 19th, Brigadier General Wharton, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, publicly announced that "the U.S. Marine Corps has transferred the matter of repatriating Japanese troops to their home country to the Chinese government for handling." On February 9th, the U.S. military authorities in Shanghai announced that from the end of February, "all ships sending Japanese back to their country will be driven by the Japanese themselves." Most of the ships are also Japanese ships, and the U.S. only has "tank landing ships participating in the same work." These simple points are enough to illustrate the true picture of the U.S. military presence in China.
    No matter how the U.S. authorities delay the repatriation work, according to a dispatch from United Press Shanghai on the 15th: "The U.S. military announced that the work of sending Japanese people back to their country from mainland China has been completed, including 2.2 million Japanese...all of whom have been sent back to their country." Therefore, the situation has now undergone a fundamental change. Although the U.S. has not mentioned a word about leaving tens of thousands of Japanese prisoners to engage in civil war, all the pretexts for the U.S. military's presence in China have finally been lost. If the U.S. military does not immediately withdraw from China, the Chinese people will have sufficient reason not to call this army an allied army, but only an occupying army like MacArthur's stationed in Tokyo. If it is wrong to say so, then the U.S. authorities must declare that all the previous solemn statements of the U.S. side are invalid, or transport the Japanese army from Japan to China again. The fact is that the U.S. occupation of Japan is relaxing day by day, while the occupation of China, which is not called occupation, is intensifying day by day! The U.S. has only 200,000 occupation troops stationed in Japan, and MacArthur has stated that he will reduce it by another 50,000, leaving only 150,000. And how many are the occupation troops in China that are not called occupation troops? The Marine Corps in North China alone has more than 53,000 troops. According to the Associated Press report in the Tianjin English Evening News on July 1st, there are 90,000 troops (plus two huge fleets, a huge air force, a huge U.S. military headquarters, a huge U.S. military advisory group...etc.). Adding these together, is it more or less than 150,000? Only the U.S. authorities themselves know. Judging from their actions, the two armies are not without similarities. For example, the U.S. military in Tokyo prevents mass demonstrations, armed guards the Japanese Emperor's palace and the Prime Minister's residence, and does not allow people to petition, claiming to protect "order," etc. In China, doesn't the U.S. military also occupy Chinese ports, fortresses, railways, and airports, and feel interested in the "security" of Chinese cities (such as Qingdao)? The fleet removes its gun covers and aims at the chests of the Chinese people, practicing fortress assault battles, etc., all the way to the Anpingzhen Incident in eastern Hebei on July 29th, in which dozens of U.S. troops launched an armed attack on our liberated areas. In Japan, they "protect order," and in China, they "maintain security." What are the other differences besides this? The current situation is that the United States has not only reduced China to the status of its Latin American colony, but has also reduced China to the status of Iceland, which has a population of only 100,000 and no national defense, because in these two places, the United States has openly violated its contracts and continued to station troops, and has disregarded the sovereignty of these two countries in the same way.
    Originally, before Japan surrendered, we never opposed the landing of U.S. troops in China, and we very much welcomed this landing, joining hands with the Chinese army and people to drive out the Japanese invaders. At that time, the Chinese people were eagerly waiting, but as a result, not a single U.S. troop landed. After Japan surrendered for more than a month, the U.S. military, in the posture of victors, massively descended on China, using the excuse of "repatriation" to station in China for ten months. Now that the repatriation has been completed, the U.S. military has lost the reason to stay in China for even a minute longer. If the U.S. authorities still want to maintain a little diplomatic credibility, if they still want to maintain a little friendship with the 450 million Chinese people, they should fulfill this promise and immediately withdraw all U.S. troops in China.
    We would like to solemnly tell the U.S. authorities that the international reputation that the late President Roosevelt established for the United States has now plummeted. On May 20th, United Press reported that several New York newspapers published editorials that day, saying: "Our country (the United States) is the richest, best-fed, and most disliked country in the world today." With the U.S. authorities' current behavior in China, the Chinese people really cannot "like" it. If the Chinese people "liked" the U.S. authorities' current behavior in China, they would have "liked" the Japanese invaders' behavior in China long ago, and there would have been no need for the War of Resistance. People with clear heads in the U.S. authorities should deeply understand this and reflect it in their China policy.
    Finally, let us shout to the people of China and the United States: We are not a defeated country! We are not Iceland! U.S. troops should not occupy China!

### 美军不应占领中国

　　美军不应占领中国
    曾彦修
    最近美国当局对于美国驻华任务，有几次负责的声明，也即对于毛泽东同志和宋庆龄先生月来代表全国人民要求美国停止一切军事援蒋撤退美国在华一切驻军声明的正式回答。对于前者，据中央社华盛顿六月二十五日的专电说：“美国务院发言人重申在华美军之驻扎，系应中国政府之请求，用以遣送在华日军者。美军在华之唯一目的即在于此。”对于后者，据美新闻处华盛顿七月二十三日电，国务院发言人当日评论宋庆龄先生日前的声明时称：“美军驻华的目的，也仅仅限于协助中国完成其领土上日军之撤退。”如众所周知，杜鲁门氏在其去年十二月对华政策声明与美苏英三外长会议协议上，也曾作过同样性质的声明。在三外长协议上美方声称：“美军的重要任务是执行日本投降条件，即是解除日军武装与撤退日军的责任。这些任务一旦完结时，或在中国政府没有美军援助能够执行这些任务时，美军即撤离中国。”但是过去的十四月以来，在华美军的行为就是一直与这些声明不符与违背的。因为：第一，华中华南同样集中有更多的日俘，但并未有一个作战美军登陆。其集中在华北港口遣送的日俘（日侨也在内），据本月十五日美军总部在上海最后宣布的也只有五十五万人。而驻华北美军则有五万三千，到现在已经遣送了十个月，每人每月平均只遣送了一个日本人。这不是天大的笑话吗？！第二，遣俘工作，据美方宣布，早已移交国民党政府和日人方面自行办理。今年七月十九日，美驻华陆战队参谋长华顿准将已公开宣布“美陆战队已将日军遣返本国之事项移交中国政府办理”。二月九日，美军当局又在上海宣布：自二月底起，“所有遣送日人返国之船只，一律改由日人自行驾驶”。船舶也绝大部分是日本船，美方只有“坦克登陆轮艘参加进行同样工作”。这简单的几点，已经足够说明美军驻华的事实真象了。
    不管美方当局把遣俘工作如何拖延，据合众社上海十五日电：“美军宣布自中国本部遣送日人返国工作已完成，其中包括二百二十万日本人……皆已遣送归国。”因此，现在的情况已发生根本的变化了，虽然美方对于留下××万余日俘从事内战一字未提，现在美军驻华的一切借口，已最后失去了。如果美军再不立即从中国撤退，中国人民将有充分理由不把这种军队叫做盟军，而只能叫做和麦克阿瑟驻在东京一样的占领军了。如果这样说是错的，那么美国当局就必须声明上属美方历次庄严的声明全部不作数，或者把日军再从日本运到中国来。事实是：美国对日本的占领是在一天天地放松，而对中国的不被称为占领的占领，则是一天天的加紧了！美国派驻日本的占领军，只有二十万，麦克阿瑟已声明还要减少五万，就只剩十五万。而在中国的不叫做占领军的占领军又是多少呢？单在华北的海军陆战队，就有五万三千余人，据天津英文晚报七月一日美联社消息，则有九万名（还有两个庞大的舰队，庞大的空军，庞大的美军总部，庞大的美国军事顾问团……等等）。把这些加在一起，究竟比十五万多还是少？就只有美国当局自己知道。再从他们的行动上看，两军也不是没有相同之点。例如：美军在东京阻止群众示威，武装保卫日皇皇宫和首相官邸，不准人民前去请愿，声称保卫“秩序”等等，在中国美军不是也同样的占领中国的港口要塞、铁道、机场，对中国城市（如青岛）的“治安”感觉兴趣？舰队脱下炮衣，对准中国人民的胸膛，演习堡垒攻击战等等，一直到酿成七月二十九日的冀东安平镇事件，美军数十人向我解放区武装进攻，在日本“保卫秩序”，在中国“维持治安”，除此以外，其他的区别在那里？现在的情形是：美国已不但把中国降到它的殖民地的拉丁美洲的地位，而且也已把中国降到只有十万人口的没有国防的冰岛的地位了，因为在这两个地方，美国如出一辙地公开违约继续驻军，如出一辙地蔑视这两个国家的主权。
    本来，在日本投降之前，我们从没有反对过美军在华登陆，而且十分欢迎这种登陆，与中国军民并肩驱逐日寇。那时中国人民望眼欲穿，结果，美军却一个也没有登陆。等到日本投降了一个多月以后，美军反以胜利者的姿态，大量君临中国，借口“遣俘”在中国驻了十个月，现在遣俘已经完成，美军即使再在中国留驻一分钟的理由也失去了。美国当局如果还愿意维持一点外交信誉，如果还愿保持一点与四万万五千万中国人民的友谊，就应当实践这个诺言，立即撤退一切在华美军。
    我们愿意正告美国当局，故罗斯福总统为美国所建立起的国际声誉，现在是已经一落千丈了。今年五月二十日合众社报导当天纽约若干报纸的社论说：“我国（美国）是今天世界上最富的、吃得最好的、人家最不喜欢的国家。”像美国当局现在在华的行为，中国人民实在无法“喜欢”。如果中国人民“喜欢”了美国当局现在在华的行为，他们老早便“喜欢”了日本侵略者在华的行为，用不着抗战了。这一点，美国当局中头脑清醒的人，是应当深深了解并反映到它的对华政策中去的。
    最后，让我们向全中国和全美国人民高呼：我们不是战败国！我们不是冰岛！美军不应当占领中国！
