Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 5th. Since the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and the West Manchuria Sub-bureau issued the call to cadres to go to the countryside to carry out the mass movement, a surge of cadres going to the countryside has been vigorously unfolding in the Liaoji District. Local prefectural and county party committees have mobilized nearly 2,000 new and veteran cadres to go to the countryside to work. The Liaoji Provincial Party Committee recently decided to transfer a large number of cadres to the lower levels to mobilize the masses. Except for one responsible comrade who will remain, the rest of the Provincial Party Committee's organs will all go to the countryside. Various departments of the Administrative Office, as well as the Democratic Academy and the Military and Political Cadre School, will transfer some or all of their personnel to the countryside, numbering 800 people, including Mongolian youth cadres. The cadres going to the countryside will form four large work groups, personally led by the main responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee. In addition, the party committees of each sub-district plan to transfer another 500 cadres to the countryside. It is estimated that this time, the number of cadres going to the countryside will reach more than 3,300.
